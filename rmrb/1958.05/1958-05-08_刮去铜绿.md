Thick ancient and thin modern, is a deeply rooted traditional concept. In the old society, literati "poetry must be the High Tang Dynasty", "books do not talk about Qin and Han Dynasties and later", in today's socialist era, there are also a considerable number of people who highly praise ancient works, but close their eyes to contemporary things and insist that they are not good. When talking about the ancient, they are well-versed and full of interest; when talking about the present, they are tongue-tied, and their humble attitude is vividly displayed. In the hot, bustling, booming, and passionate atmosphere, they teach young people to "seek, seek, cold, cold, clear, clear"... they favour the ancient feudalism and despise the modern socialism. The spirit expressed between thick and thin runs counter to the times. Our inheritance of literary and artistic traditions is very different from the obsession with skeletons. Here, Chairman Mao has set up a yardstick for us. Obsession with skeletons is to let the dead drag down the living, while critical acceptance is to let the ancient serve the modern.

I remember Lu Xun said in the seventh draft of "Untitled" such a story: a local tyrant bought an ancient tripod, wiped its earth flowers and verdigris clean, and placed it in the hall, shining with copper light. The guests who saw it couldn't help but laugh secretly. Lu Xun, after laughing at this brightened ancient tripod, "gained an enlightenment. This enlightenment is not a 'philosophical meaning', but feels that this is the first time he has seen the Zhou tripod close to the truth." He also said: "The tripod in the Zhou Dynasty is just like the bowl in modern times. There is no reason why our bowl should not be washed all year round, so the tripod at that time must have been clean and shining brightly. In other words, it is not 'solemn', but rather 'enthusiastic'." This insightful view is thought-provoking. If the ancient tripod is not only regarded as an antique, and the verdigris is not scraped off, how can we identify its original appearance and show its scientific research value?

I think this story is very meaningful to us. Just think about it, how many people (more than hundreds and thousands!) regard Chinese classical literature and art as green and mottled antiques to appreciate? If the verdigris is scraped off and it is used for the present, how many people will not only laugh secretly but also feel heartache!

We love the "Airs of the States" in the "Book of Songs" because it is folk poetry from more than two thousand years ago. It expresses the environmental conditions of that era and reflects the living conditions of the people. Now, tens of thousands of folk songs have been produced in the Great Leap Forward, from which we can hear the heroic voices of the working people in the socialist era. We must not hold the "Airs of the States" as the most precious treasure, but despise the "New Airs of the States" of this socialist era, thinking that it is not worthy of entering the elegant halls of literature and art. Inherit the ancient with the present, and use the ancient for the present. The Yangtze River and the Yellow River are also serving socialist construction. The tradition of literature and art should also be like the Yangtze River and the Yellow River. The goddess in mythology has stayed on Wushan Mountain for two thousand years. Today, she suddenly appears in Chairman Mao's poems. If she knew, I think she would be full of joy.

"Do not despise modern people and love ancient people", between the ancient and the modern, Du Fu stepped on two boats.

"Talented people come forth from generation to generation, each leading the way for hundreds of years." Fresh flowers are blooming in the soil of the socialist era. We must appreciate and value these fresh flowers. For classical literary works, we must scrape off its verdigris and let it shine brightly for the socialist literary and artistic cause.

    刮去铜绿
    臧克家
    厚古薄今，是一个根深蒂固的传统观念。旧社会里的文人，“诗必盛唐”，“书不谈秦汉以下”，在今天社会主义的时代里，也有为数甚多的人对于古代的作品，推崇备至，对于当代的东西，则闭起眼睛，硬说它不行。谈古，头头是道，兴味盎然；道今则张口结舌，卑睥之态可掬。在热热，闹闹，轰轰，烈烈的空气中，却教导青年去“寻寻，觅觅，冷冷，清清”…厚封建主义之古，薄社会主义之今。厚薄之间，表现出来的精神与时代背道而驰。我们承继文艺传统，与迷恋骸骨迥乎不同。在这里，毛主席给我们竖立了标尺。迷恋骸骨，是叫死人拖住活人，批判接受，是叫古人为现代服务。
    记得鲁迅在“题未定”草之七里说了这样一个故事：一个土财主，买了一个古鼎，把它的土花和铜绿擦得一干二净，放在厅堂里，闪闪发着铜光。客人们看了，无不暗笑。鲁迅对着这放亮的古鼎，笑过之后，“得了一种启示。这启示并非‘哲学的意蕴’，是觉得这才看见了近于真相的周鼎。”他还说：“鼎在周朝，恰如碗之在现代，我们的碗，无整年不洗之理，所以鼎在当时，一定是干干净净，金光灿烂的，换了术语来说，就是它并不‘静穆’，倒有些‘热烈’。”这精辟的见解是足以令人深思的。如果把古鼎不仅仅当作古董，不刮去铜绿，又将如何鉴识它的本来面目，表现出它的科学研究价值呢？
    我觉得这个故事对我们很有意义。试想想看，有多少人（何只百千！）把中国的古典文艺当作绿色斑剥的古董玩赏？如果刮去它的铜绿，叫它为今用，又有多少人不只暗笑而且心痛呢！
    “诗经”里的“国风”，我们爱它，因为它是两千多年前来自民间的诗歌。它表现了那个时代环境，反映了人民的生活状况。现在，大跃进中产生了数以万计的民歌，从中可以听到社会主义时代劳动人民的豪迈声音。我们决不能捧“国风”为至宝，对于这社会主义时代的“新国风”，则鄙薄它，以为不足以登文艺的大雅之堂。今以承古，古为今用。长江黄河，也在为社会主义建设服务。文艺的传统也应该像长江黄河。神话中的神女，在巫山上呆了两千年了，今天，她忽然出现在毛主席的词里，如果有知，我想她一定满心欢喜。
    “不薄今人爱古人”，在今古之间，杜甫脚踏两头船。
    “江山代有才人出，各领风骚数百年”。社会主义时代的土壤里开放着新鲜的花朵。我们要欣赏，重视这些鲜花。对于古典文学作品，我们要刮去它的铜绿，叫它为社会主义的文艺事业大放光明。
