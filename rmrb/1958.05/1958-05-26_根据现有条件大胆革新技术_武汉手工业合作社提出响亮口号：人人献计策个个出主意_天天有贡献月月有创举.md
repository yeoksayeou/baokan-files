Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 25th. The Wuhan Municipal Handicraft Department recently held a meeting and decided that the city's handicrafts industry should immediately launch a mass-based technical innovation movement, merging with the city's industrial sector into a torrent of technical innovation.

Prior to this, Wuhan's handicraft cooperative members had some incorrect views on technical innovation: some believed that members' cultural and technical level was low, and without senior technicians and engineers, they couldn't achieve much; some blindly believed in the "conditions theory," thinking that handicraft cooperatives must add a large number of machines and equipment to carry out technical innovation, and did not pay attention to summarizing and improving their own experience; others clung to old technologies and were afraid to break with conventions.

The meeting criticized these erroneous ideas, believing that the technical innovation movement is an important part of the great leap forward in the production of handicraft organizations, and has a particularly significant meaning for the development of handicraft production. It can promote handicraft cooperatives to get rid of manual operation as early as possible, realize mechanization and semi-mechanization of production, and thus push the technical level of handicrafts to a new stage. Since the beginning of this spring, some handicraft cooperatives have reformed about 100 kinds of production tools, increasing labor efficiency by several times to dozens of times. For example, the red furnace of the Second Ironware Cooperative in Jianghan District originally relied entirely on manual operation, and production efficiency was very low. Members Jin Zhongcai and Pan Binzi used old railway tracks and old iron plates to successfully trial-produce a belt hammer, increasing production efficiency by more than ten times and reducing labor intensity.

The meeting decided that the city's handicraft cooperatives should immediately rely on their own efforts to utilize existing conditions, launch a mass-based technical innovation movement, mobilize members to boldly imagine, and guide them towards a technical innovation climax of "everyone contributes ideas, everyone offers suggestions, daily contributions, monthly innovations." For members who demonstrate originality, they must be given strong support; the city and districts will establish technical research organizations at all levels, provide regular technical guidance, and organize visits to members' major inventions and creations, summarizing and promoting their advanced experiences. The meeting also called on grassroots cooperatives to value the rich experience of veteran workers and pay attention to giving full play to their active role in the technical innovation movement.

    根据现有条件大胆革新技术
    武汉手工业合作社提出响亮口号：
    人人献计策个个出主意  天天有贡献月月有创举
    新华社武汉25日电　武汉市手工业部门最近召开会议，决定全市手工业立即开展群众性的技术革新运动，同全市工业部门汇合成技术革新的洪流。
    在这以前，武汉市手工业社员对于技术革新有一些不正确的看法：有些人认为社员文化技术水平低，没有高级技术人员和工程师，搞不出什么名堂来；有些人迷信“条件论”，认为手工业社搞技术革新必需添置大批机器设备，不重视总结提高自己的经验；也有些人抱住老一套技术，不敢打破陈规。
    会议批判了这些错误思想，认为技术革新运动是手工业组织生产大跃进的一个重要环节，对手工业生产的发展有着特别重大的意义。它可以促使手工业社提早摆脱手工操作，实现机械化和半机械化生产，从而把手工业的技术水平推向新的阶段。今春以来部分手工业社已改革了生产工具一百种左右，提高劳动效率几倍到几十倍。如江汉区第二铁器社的红炉原来全靠手工操作，生产效率很低，社员金仲才和潘斌兹利用旧铁轨旧铁板，试制成功一个皮带锤，提高生产效率十多倍，并减轻了劳动强度。
    会议决定全市手工业社立即自力更生地利用现有条件，开展群众性的技术革新运动，发动社员大胆设想，导向一个“人人献计策，个个出主意，天天有贡献，月月有创举”的技术革新高潮。对于发挥独创精神的社员必须给以大力支持；市、区将层层建立技术研究组织，经常予以技术上的指导，并组织参观社员的重大发明创造，总结推广他们的先进经验。会议还要求基层社重视老师傅们的丰富经验，注意在技术革新运动中充分发挥他们的积极作用。
