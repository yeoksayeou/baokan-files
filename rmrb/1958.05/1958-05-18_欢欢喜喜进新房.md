　　Moving into New Homes with Joy
　　Chen Zongzhi

　　The first residential area of the Friendship Agricultural Cooperative in the western suburbs of Chengdu was completed on April 29th with six buildings. The first residential area can be fully completed by the end of May. The second residential area started construction in mid-May and will be completed before the autumn harvest. The third and fourth residential areas will also be built successively in a fast, good, and economical manner. The largest residential area houses 500 households, and the smallest houses over 100 households, all of which are brick and wood structured two-story buildings. Currently, the first residential area under construction has a total of twenty-one buildings, with twenty-four rooms per building (eight kitchen rooms), averaging three rooms per household (including the kitchen), totaling 59 square meters.

　　Early in the morning on April 30th, fifty outstanding cooperative members from each team joyfully moved into their new homes. Liu Chengyu, the captain of the fortieth team, said happily after moving into his new house: Since the Communist Party came, I live in an upstairs and downstairs house. During the Kuomintang era, I lived with the dead in the cemetery. It's truly a heaven and a hell! The old farmer Zhong Qingrong, a four-generation household, happily moved into his new house holding his great-grandson. Old man Chen Shaoyuan laughed heartily after seeing his new house and said: Chairman Mao has come, and we are truly enjoying a good life! Even the stove has been built so solidly for me. I've lived for sixty-nine years, and my beard is white, but this is the first time I've seen such a good thing. This old man will also work hard in production to repay!

　　After hearing the news, farmers from other counties and suburbs went to visit. Early in the morning on the 30th, members of the Happiness Cooperative of the Mutual Aid Township in the western suburbs and the Zhonghe Cooperative of the Desheng Township in the eastern suburbs praised the houses as beautiful and with good air after the visit. Xie Anxiu from Zhonghe Cooperative said: This house is a model, and we must learn from them. Su Guiying said: After returning, I must introduce it to the cooperative, use old materials, old tiles, and the voluntary labor of the cooperative members to build houses that are both economical and good.

　　The Friendship Cooperative proposed the construction of these residential areas during the discussion of the draft 40 articles of the Agricultural Development Program this year. After repeated research by the cooperative's drafting committee and with the support and assistance of the higher-level Party organization, it was decided to build such multi-story buildings suitable for socialist development. The construction of residential areas is based on the principle of running the cooperative diligently and thriftily, and using local materials. Old wood and old tiles dismantled by cooperative members are all handed over to the cooperative for use without compensation. Sand and stone are dredged by cooperative members locally, and bricks are partially burned by themselves and partially purchased. In addition to the technicians aided by the urban construction department, ordinary workers are allocated from within the cooperative and apportioned as voluntary labor according to their work. In this way, building houses frugally costs less than eight yuan per square meter. The construction funds rely on the cooperative's self-reliance. It mainly mobilizes cooperative members to invest, and 20% of the increased agricultural and sideline production in the next two years will not be distributed to cooperative members, and mobilizing cooperative members to reduce the return of cash can solve all the problems.

　　Cadres and members of the Friendship Cooperative compared the new and old houses, and they believe that the new houses have eight major benefits:

　　1. There are glass windows in front and behind the house, white powder walls on both sides, and red paint on the old doors and windows. It's bright in all directions. The old houses are dark, with no air circulation, no shelter from rain, and require minor repairs every year and major repairs every five years, costing more than forty yuan each time, which only lasts for a few years. Now, building such a new house costs more than one hundred and thirty yuan, which can be used for decades.

　　2. Concentrated residence expands the cultivated land area. The cooperative members of each team in the fourth farming area originally lived scattered in twenty-seven courtyards, occupying one hundred and fifty mu of farmland area. Now, concentrated residence only occupies thirty mu, which expands one hundred and twenty mu of cultivated land.

　　3. Demolishing old houses accumulates fertilizer. Demolishing the old houses in twenty-seven courtyards in the sixth farming area can accumulate 900,000 jin of slag fertilizer, wall mud, and various fertilizers, and the entire cooperative can accumulate 70 million jin.

　　4. It is convenient for leaders and cooperative members to engage in political and cultural activities. The sixth farming area is three miles long and wide, and it takes one or two hours for everyone to arrive for meetings and reading newspapers. Not to mention the entire cooperative, it takes several hours just to notify each team. Now, it takes at most half an hour to notify everyone to attend a meeting. In the past, it was difficult to deliver and read newspapers due to the scattered residences, and cooperative members did not subscribe to or read newspapers. Now that there are favorable conditions, the cooperative has subscribed to fifty-seven copies of "Farmers' Daily" from May onwards to organize cooperative members to read newspapers. The cooperative's books can also be distributed to cooperative members for circulation according to their residences, which can greatly meet the needs of cooperative members' cultural life.

　　5. Separation of humans and livestock improves sanitation conditions. In the past, grass houses, pig and cattle pens, kitchens, living rooms, and toilets were all built together, and the smell was offensive during meals and sleep. It was unclean and unsanitary, and both humans and livestock were prone to illness. Now, living rooms and kitchens are separated, and there is a small river around the living rooms, and pig and cattle pens and toilets are located outside the small river. The living rooms are clean and sanitary, and everyone is healthy and comfortable.

　　6. It facilitates mechanized farming and large-scale mechanization. Scattered residences, each with a courtyard, with many courtyards, many small roads, and many ditches, affect large-scale mechanized farming. Concentrated residential areas can maximize the expansion of cultivated land and promote mechanization.

　　7. It facilitates greening and road and water conservancy renovation planning to better serve agricultural production. In the past, waterways were winding, with some ditches having more water and less irrigation, and some fields needing water but lacking water for irrigation, failing to fully utilize the irrigation function of water. Changing the waterways also affects the water use of cooperative members. Now that residences are concentrated, it is possible to uniformly plan waterways and roads.

　　8. The cooperative's grain is managed by cooperative members, and the cooperative members' grass houses are inconvenient for fire and theft prevention. Concentrated brick houses, with public warehouses, make it easy to protect public property and grain, and it is also easy to prevent fires.

　　欢欢喜喜进新房
　　陈宗治
    成都市郊西城乡友谊农业社的第一个住宅区，在4月29日建成六幢，5月底第一个就可全部建成。第二个住宅区在5月中旬动工，秋收前完成。第三、第四住宅区也将同样以又快、又好、又省的办法，陆续建造。住宅区最大的住五百户，最小的住一百多户，都是一楼一底砖木结构的楼房。目前，修建的第一个住宅区共二十一幢，每幢二十四间（八间灶房）平均每户住三间（灶房在内），共五十九平方公尺。
    4月30日一早，各队五十户优秀社员已欢欢喜喜地分别搬进新居，四十队队长刘成玉搬进新房后高兴地说：共产党来了，我住的是楼上楼下，国民党时候，我和死人一起住在坟坝里，真是一个天堂、一个地狱呀！四代同堂的老农锺清荣抱着他的重孙高兴地搬进了新房。陈少元老汉看了他的新房高兴得哈哈大笑说：毛主席来了，真是享福呀！连灶都给我打得巴巴实实的，我活了六十九岁，胡子都白了，还是第一次看到这样的好事情。我老汉也要搞好生产，报答报答！
    外县及郊区农民听到消息后都纷纷前往参观，30日一早，西郊互助乡幸福社和东郊德胜乡中合社社员参观后，都称赞这种房屋漂亮，空气又好。中合社谢安秀说：这个房子是典型，我们要向他们学习。苏桂英说：回去以后，一定向社里介绍，用旧料、旧瓦、社员义务劳动来修建，修的房子又节约又好。
    友谊社修建这些住宅区，是在今年社员讨论农业发展纲要草案四十条时提出的。经过社里起草委员会的多次研究，得到上级党组织的支持和帮助，才决定修这样适合社会主义发展的楼房。修建住宅区本着勤俭办社、就地取材的原则进行。社员拆下的旧木、旧瓦，一律无代价交社使用，沙、石由社员就地打涝，砖自烧一部分、买一部分。建设工人除技工由城市建筑部门援助外，普通工由社内调配，按劳分摊作为义务工。这样勤俭修房，每平方公尺造价不到八元。修建资金靠社自力更生。主要动员社员投资，今明两年农副增产部分的20％不分给社员和动员社员少分回现金，就能全部解决。
    友谊社干部和社员对新旧房进行比较，他们认为新房有八大好处：
    一、屋前屋后玻璃窗，左右两面白粉墙，门窗旧料上红漆，四面八方亮堂堂。旧房黑洞洞，不通空气，不避雨，年年小修，五年大修，修一次要四十多元，只管几年。现在，修这样一间新房一百三十多元，就可用几十年。
    二、居住集中，扩大耕地面积。第四耕作区各队的社员原来分散住在二十七个院子里，占了一百五十亩田面积，现在集中居住，只占三十亩，这就扩大了一百二十亩耕田。
    三、拆旧房积肥料。第六耕作区拆了二十七个院子的旧房，能积渣肥、墙泥各种肥料九十万斤，全社就能积七千万斤。
    四、便于领导和社员从事政治文化活动。第六耕作区纵横三里路，开会、读报要一两个钟头才来得齐。全社就更不消说了，光通知各队，都要好几个钟头。现在通知全体开会，最多半个钟点就到齐。以前居住分散，送报、读报困难，社员都没订报读报，现在有了有利条件，社里从5月份起，订了五十七份农民报，组织社员读报。社里的图书，也可以按居住点分给社员轮流传阅，这就能大大满足社员文化生活的需要。
    五、人畜隔离，改善了卫生条件。以前的草房，猪、牛圈、灶房、住房、厕所，都修在一起，吃饭、睡觉臭气熏人，不清洁、不卫生，人、畜都容易生病。现在住房、灶房隔开，住房周围还有小河，小河以外才是猪、牛圈、厕所，住房清洁、卫生，人人心身健康，住着舒服。
    六、便于实行机耕和大面积机械化。居住分散，各家一个院子，院子多，小路多，河沟多，影响大面积机耕。集中居住区就可以尽量扩大耕地面积，促进机械化。
    七、便于绿化和道路、水利改造规划，更好地为农业生产服务。过去水路弯来弯去，有的沟水多灌田少，有的田需水灌又没水灌，不能充分发挥水的灌溉作用。改了水路，又影响社员用水。现在居住集中，就能统一规划水路、道路。
    八、社里粮食由社员分管，社员住的草屋，不便防火、防盗。集中住砖房，又有公仓，公共财产和粮食都好保护，又容易防火。
