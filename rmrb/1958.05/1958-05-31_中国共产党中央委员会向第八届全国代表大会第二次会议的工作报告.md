      The issue of construction speed is the most important issue facing us after the victory of the socialist revolution. Our revolution is precisely for the most rapid development of social productive forces. China's economy was originally very backward, and there is still imperialism outside our country. Only by speeding up construction as much as possible can we consolidate our socialist country as soon as possible and improve the living standards of the people.

      建设速度的问题，是社会主义革命胜利后摆在我们面前的最重要的问题。我们的革命就是为了最迅速地发展社会生产力。我国经济本来很落后，我国的外部还有帝国主义，只有尽可能地加快建设，才能尽快地巩固我们的社会主义国家，提高人民的生活水平。
