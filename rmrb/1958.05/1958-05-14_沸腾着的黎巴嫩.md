　　Lebanon is in turmoil. The national patriotic and democratic forces throughout the country are waging a fierce struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agent, the Chamoun regime.

　　Lebanon is located in southwestern Asia, bordering the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Syria to the east and north, and Israel to the south. It covers an area of approximately 10,360 square kilometers. The terrain is elevated, with areas above 900 meters accounting for more than half of the total area. The population is approximately 1.32 million, of which about 53% are Christian, 40% are Muslim, and the remaining 7% adhere to Judaism and other religions.

　　Lebanon has a relatively important geographical location, serving as a necessary transit point for Middle Eastern countries to communicate with European and American countries through the Mediterranean Sea. Three oil pipelines, used by imperialists to plunder Middle Eastern oil, pass through Lebanon: two parallel pipelines, each 531 miles long, run from Kirkuk, the oil production center in Iraq, through Syria to Tripoli on the Lebanese west coast; in addition, the American-controlled Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO) also has a pipeline from the west coast of the Persian Gulf through Sidon, Lebanon, for export, with a total length of 1,068.2 miles and an annual oil transport capacity of 16 million tons. Lebanon was conquered by Turkey in the 16th century and belonged to the Ottoman Empire. After the First World War, it became a French mandate. In June 1941, British and French forces occupied Lebanon, and although they had to declare Lebanon's independence in November, British and French forces refused to withdraw. In February 1946, Lebanon filed a complaint with the UN Security Council, and with the support of the Soviet Union, finally forced the British and French forces to withdraw completely from Lebanon in August. However, due to the Lebanese government's failure to implement policies that conformed to the national interest, especially the policies implemented since Chamoun was elected president in 1952, Lebanon's national independence was undermined by imperialism, and it eventually succumbed to the United States. Following the signing of the "Point Four Program" with the United States in 1951, Lebanon signed an economic "aid" agreement with the United States in June 1954. Last spring, Lebanon, disregarding the opposition of the people, accepted the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and "leased" some ports and airports to the United States. The United States is planning to establish a rocket weapons base in Lebanon.

　　But the Lebanese people have been fighting to safeguard national independence, oppose imperialism and the Eisenhower Doctrine, and oppose its agent, the Chamoun government. Since the formation of the National Front in April last year by various Lebanese parties, religious circles, and parliamentarians, the Lebanese people's struggle against imperialism has become even more vigorous. The National Front was formed after the victory of the Lebanese people's support for Egypt's opposition to imperialist aggression, with the National Congress Party and parties such as the Constitutional Bloc, the Najjadeh Party, and other opposition parties as its backbone. When the United States plotted a military invasion of Syria, the National Front mobilized the people to support Syria, forcing the government not to openly side with the American aggressors. Recently, the patriotic and democratic forces in Lebanon have become more united and have launched a fierce struggle against Chamoun's re-election. According to the current Lebanese constitution, the president's term is six years and cannot be renewed. Chamoun's term expires in September this year, and a new presidential election should be held. However, Chamoun attempted to amend the constitution in order to obtain re-election. People from all walks of life in Lebanon resolutely opposed Chamoun's re-election and launched a large-scale demonstration in Beirut in mid-April, which once resulted in armed clashes with government forces.

　　The struggle of the Lebanese people against U.S. imperialism and the Chamoun regime continues. Until now, it has erupted into an unprecedented, large-scale, and fierce struggle nationwide. From Tripoli to the capital Beirut, from northern Lebanon to other regions and cities, strikes, market boycotts, mass demonstrations, and armed uprisings have unfolded. The powerful Lebanese people and public opinion demand that Chamoun resign and liberate the country from the shackles of the Eisenhower Doctrine.

　　沸腾着的黎巴嫩
    黎巴嫩在沸腾着。全国爱国民主力量正在展开反对美帝国主义及其代理人夏蒙政权的激烈斗争。
    黎巴嫩位于亚洲西南部，西临地中海，东部和北部同叙利亚为邻，南与以色列接壤。面积约一万零三百六十平方公里。地势高亢，高达九百公尺以上的地带约占总面积的二分之一以上。人口约一百三十二万，其中信仰基督教的约53％，40％信仰伊斯兰教，另外7％的人信奉犹太教和其它宗教。
    黎巴嫩有着较重要的地理位置，是中东国家通过地中海和欧美
  国家往来的必经地之一。帝国主义掠夺中东石油的油管，有三条经过黎巴嫩：由伊拉克产油中心基尔库克经叙利亚到黎巴嫩西岸的黎波里有两条各长五百三十一英里平行的油管；另外，美国垄断组织控制的阿美石油公司，也从波斯湾西岸设有油管经黎巴嫩的西顿港出口，全长一千零六十八点二英里，每年可输油一千六百万吨。黎巴嫩在十六世纪时被土耳其征服，属于奥斯曼帝国的一部分。第一次世界大战后，成为法国委任统治地。1941年6月，英法军队占领了黎巴嫩，11月虽然不得不宣布黎巴嫩独立，但英法军队仍不肯撤出。1946年2月，黎巴嫩向联合国安理会提出控诉，在苏联的支持下，终于迫使英法军队在8月全部撤出了黎巴嫩。但由于黎巴嫩政府未能执行符合民族利益的政策，特别是自1952年夏蒙当选总统后执行的政策，使黎巴嫩的民族独立受到帝国主义的摧残，直至屈从于美国。黎巴嫩继1951年与美国签订“第四点计划”后，于1954年6月又同美国缔结经济“援助”协定。去年春，黎巴嫩更不顾人民的反对，接受了“艾森豪威尔主义”，并把一些港口和机场“租让”给美国。美国正计划在黎巴嫩建立火箭武器基地。
    但黎巴嫩人民一直为维护民族独立、反对帝国主义和艾森豪威尔主义及其代理人夏蒙政府而进行斗争。自从去年4月黎巴嫩各不同党派、宗教界和议员们组成了民族阵线以来，黎巴嫩人民的反对帝国主义斗争更为高涨。民族阵线是在黎巴嫩人民声援埃及反对帝国主义侵略取得胜利后，以国民大会党所联合的各党派，如立宪集团、纳加德党及其他反对党为骨干而组成的。当美国策划军事侵略叙利亚时，民族阵线又动员人民支持叙利亚，迫使政府不敢公开站在美国侵略者一边。最近，黎巴嫩的爱国民主力量，更加团结起来，展开了反对夏蒙连任的激烈斗争。按照黎巴嫩现行宪法的规定，总统任期六年，不得连任。今年9月夏蒙任期届满，理当举行新总统的选举。但夏蒙企图修改宪法，以便取得连任。黎巴嫩各阶层人民坚决反对夏蒙连任，曾于4月中旬在贝鲁特发动了大规模的示威运动，同政府军一度发生武装冲突。
    黎巴嫩人民反对美帝国主义和夏蒙政权的斗争，继续展开。直到现在，已爆发成为全国范围的空前规模的激烈斗争。从的黎波里到首都贝鲁特，从黎巴嫩北部到其他地区和城市，都展开了罢工、罢市、群众示威和武装起义。声势浩大的黎巴嫩人民和舆论界，要求夏蒙辞职，把国家从艾森豪威尔主义的束缚中解放出来。
