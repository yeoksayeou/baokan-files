	Power-Saving and Durable Fluorescent Lamps
	You Chang
	Fluorescent lamps have only been around for about twenty years since their invention, but they have been widely adopted due to their many advantages: power saving, durability, and soft light.

	Fluorescent lamps, which are much brighter than incandescent lamps, are also very power-saving. Incandescent lamps rely on high-temperature filaments to produce light. The light-emitting principle of fluorescent lamps is more complex. The inner wall of a fluorescent lamp tube is coated with a substance called phosphor, and the tube is filled with mercury vapor and argon gas. There is an electrode at each end of the tube. When current passes through the tube, the electrodes emit electrons that collide with mercury vapor molecules. The mercury vapor gains energy from the electrons and emits an invisible light – ultraviolet light. The phosphor on the tube wall absorbs the ultraviolet light and converts it into visible light, which is called fluorescence. The temperature of the fluorescent tube is only 40 to 50 degrees Celsius when fluorescence occurs. Because the light-emitting temperature is low, less heat is lost than with incandescent lamps, and the efficiency of converting electricity into light is much higher.

	Fluorescent lamps are also more durable than incandescent lamps. Incandescent lamps require high temperatures to emit light, so the filament is easily burned out. The lifespan of a typical light bulb is around 800 to 1000 hours. Fluorescent lamps emit light at a low temperature, and the lifespan of the tube is generally more than 3000 hours.

	The light from fluorescent lamps is also softer than that from incandescent lamps. Incandescent lamps emit light through high temperatures, so the light is always reddish-yellow. The fluorescent light emitted by fluorescent lamps is similar to the white light of the sun.

	However, the installation cost of fluorescent lamps is relatively high. This is because the conduction of current within the fluorescent tube relies on the gas molecules inside the tube becoming conductive ions and electrons. To achieve this, a voltage as high as 1000 to 2000 volts must be generated at the moment the lamp is turned on to impact these gas molecules. Once the lamp is lit, only a few dozen volts are needed to maintain the light. Therefore, a starter and a ballast are required to generate the high voltage needed to light the lamp at the moment it is turned on, and to control the appropriate voltage inside the lamp after it is lit.

	When using fluorescent lamps, the following points should be noted: First, because a high voltage is generated each time the lamp is turned on, the electrodes are greatly damaged by the high voltage. To extend the life of the lamp, the number of times it is switched on and off should be reduced as much as possible. Second, if the voltage is too low, the lamp will not light and will flash continuously, which will affect its lifespan. Therefore, fluorescent lamps are generally not suitable for places with insufficient voltage. Third, if the external temperature is too low, the gas pressure inside the tube will decrease, and the lamp will also flash continuously and not light. Therefore, fluorescent lamps are generally not installed in places with low temperatures. However, this can be overcome by using a higher voltage and appropriate insulation. Recently, Shanghai successfully trial-installed China's first fluorescent lamp-lit road. Fourth, if there are no problems with the voltage and temperature, but the lamp still flashes continuously and does not light, it should be repaired immediately and not continue to be switched on to avoid damaging the lamp. Fifth, if the lamp tube is broken, it should be swept away immediately, as mercury in the lamp becomes vapor and is harmful to health if inhaled. In addition, some components in the phosphor are toxic, and care should be taken not to get the skin punctured by the glass of the lamp tube.

    省电耐用的日光灯
    有畅
    日光灯从诞生到现在只有二十来年历史，但是由于它具有许多优点：省电、耐用、光线柔和，所以很快就被人们广泛采用了。
    比电灯明亮得多的日光灯，却很省电。电灯是靠灯丝高温发光的。日光灯的发光原理比较复杂。日光灯管的内壁涂有一种叫萤光粉的物质，灯管里充满着水银蒸气和氩气管的两端又各有一个电极。当电流通过灯管时，电极放出电子撞击水银蒸气分子，水银蒸气得到了电子的能量就放出一种看不见的光——紫外光。管壁上的萤光粉在接受紫外光以后能够把它变成眼睛看得见的光放出来，这就叫作萤光现象。日光灯产生萤光现象时灯管的温度只有摄氏四十到五十度。由于发光温度低，热的散失就比电灯少，电变为光的效率也就比电灯高得多。
    日光灯还比电灯耐用。电灯发光需要高温，所以灯丝容易烧毁，一般灯泡的寿命在八百至一千小时左右。日光灯发光时温度低，灯管寿命一般在三千小时以上。
    日光灯的光线也比电灯柔和。电灯由于靠高温发光，得到的光线总是带点红黄色。而日光灯发出的萤光同太阳的白光差不多。
    但是，日光灯的装置费比较高。因为日光灯管内电流的传导，依靠管内的气体分子变成能导电的离子和电子。为了这样，必须在开灯的刹那，产生一个高达一、二千伏特的电压来冲击这些气体分子，而当灯点亮以后只需要几十伏特的电压便可继续发光，因此需要有一个开动器和限流器的装置，以便于在开灯的刹那产生高电压把灯点亮，并在灯亮以后控制灯内合适的电压。
    使用日光灯，应注意下面几点：第一，因为每次开灯时都要产生高电压，所以电极在高电压冲击下损伤很大。为了延长灯的寿命，应该尽量减少开关次数。第二，电压太低，灯会点不着而连续闪光，这会影响寿命，所以电压不足的地方，一般不宜用日光灯。第三，外界温度太低时灯管内气压降低，灯也会连续闪光点不着。因此在温度低的地方一般不装日光灯。但是如果采用较高的电压和适当的保温装置，这一点是可以克服的，最近上海就这样试装成功了中国的第一条日光灯马路。第四，如果电压和温度都没有问题，但灯仍然连续闪光不着，应该赶快检修，不要继续试开把灯弄坏。第五，灯管打破时应马上把它扫走，因为灯内水银变成蒸气被人吸入后有害健康。此外，萤光粉中有些成份是有毒的，应该小心不要被灯管的玻璃刺破皮肤。
