　　Praising the Old and Belittling the New (A short comic dialogue)
　　Lao She
　　A: Let me tell you about my father…
　　B: Wouldn't it be better to talk about yourself?
　　A: I'm not worth mentioning! Let me tell you about my grandfather…
　　B: Getting further and further away!
　　A: The further, the better!
　　B: Like a weasel giving birth to a hedgehog, each generation worse than the last, right?
　　A: Can't say it that way! Let me tell you about my distant ancestor, in the Tang Dynasty…
　　B: In the Tang Dynasty?
　　A: Yes! Fantastic! The Tang Dynasty! Just saying those two words makes me tremble with excitement!
　　B: Why do you love trembling so much?
　　A: Why? The Tang Dynasty had Du Fu, we don't!
　　B: We have Lu Xun, the Tang Dynasty didn't!
　　A: The Tang Dynasty's tri-colored clay figurines and horses! So beautiful!
　　B: Our cars and tractors are even more beautiful!
　　A: The Tang Dynasty's music and dance! "Rainbow Skirt and Feathered Robe," listen to it!
　　B: Our "At the Crossroads" and "The White Haired Girl" caused a sensation around the world! Listen to them!
　　A: Tang Monk went to the Western Regions for scriptures, passing through the Flaming Mountains!
　　B: Yes, and our railway will soon pass through the Flaming Mountains!
　　A: The great Tang Dynasty produced so many poets!
　　B: Our great era's workers, peasants, and soldiers have written so many poems!
　　A: Well, well, the Tang Dynasty's chamber pots…
　　B: Our flush toilets! Let me tell you: the Tang Dynasty didn't have large steel mills, hydroelectric power stations, couldn't build airplanes, chemical fertilizers, or large ships… The Tang Dynasty also didn't have socialism!
　　A: Don't blame me for saying it, but you have no culture: you don't love Zhou bronzes and Han tiles, you don't know the Three Tombs and Five Canons, you don't understand reviewing the old to know the new, you don't value national heritage, you don't read the books of Confucius and Mencius, you don't understand the Rites of Zhou! Really, really, really, you're making me angry to death!
　　B: Sir! Sir! Don't die yet! If you really want to compare the ancient, what I'm about to say will shock you!
　　A: You also have ancient things? Tell me, tell me!
　　B: My ancestors are many, many times further back than the Tang Dynasty!
　　A: Tell me, who are they?
　　B: Five hundred thousand years ago, the Peking Man of Zhoukoudian!
　　A: That's great!
　　B: It's not good at all!
　　A: How? How?
　　B: Stark naked, covered in hair! Eating raw meat and drinking blood, living in caves!
　　A: Isn't that quaint?
　　B: If you love going into caves, go ahead! I love our new-colored and new-scented socialism!

　　老舍
　　甲：您就说我爸爸吧……
　　乙：说说您自己不更好吗？
　　甲：我自己不值一提！您就说我的祖父吧……
　　乙：越说越远！
　　甲：越远越好嘛！
　　乙：黄鼠狼下刺猬，一辈不如一辈，是吧？
　　甲：也不能那么说！您就说我的远祖，在唐朝……
　　乙：在唐朝？

　　乙：干吗那么爱颤抖？
　　甲；干吗？唐朝有杜甫，咱们没有！
　　乙：咱们有鲁迅，唐朝没有！
　　甲：唐朝的三彩泥人泥马！多么美！

　　甲：那不古色古香吗？
　　乙：您爱进山洞去，您去！我爱我们新色新香的社会主义！
