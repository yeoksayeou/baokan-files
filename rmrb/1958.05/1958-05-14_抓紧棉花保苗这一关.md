Now, the cotton sowing work across the country has been basically completed. Amidst the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production, this year's cotton production conditions have undergone significant changes: most cotton fields have implemented deep plowing; base fertilizer has been greatly increased; the irrigated area of ​​cotton fields has more than doubled compared to last year; many major cotton-producing areas have basically achieved water conservancy; good varieties have been comprehensively popularized, and cotton seeds have been subjected to treatments such as seed selection, hot water treatment, and seed dressing with pesticides. Furthermore, this year's cotton sowing work started early, progressed quickly, and was of high quality, all of which have laid a favorable foundation for achieving this year's cotton leap forward and increased production plan. However, having these good conditions does not equal a bumper harvest. To achieve a bumper harvest, it is also necessary to do a good job in field management from now on, especially to ensure full stands of cotton, increase the number of bolls per cotton plant, and promote early maturity of cotton – these are the three keys to striving for a bumper cotton harvest.

At present, the central task of cotton field management is to ensure seedling survival. Only by ensuring good seedling survival can there be a reliable foundation for a bumper cotton harvest. Although most cotton fields were sown in a timely manner this year while the soil was moist, and seedling emergence was relatively smooth, there are also some areas where seedling emergence still has some problems, either because there was little spring rain, or because the climatic conditions were abnormal after sowing, or because the sowing techniques were not well mastered. Even in cotton fields that can emerge neatly, it is not a simple matter to ensure that seedlings grow well after emergence, because seedlings are easily killed and lost due to diseases, pests, and adverse climatic effects during the seedling stage. If cotton field management is not careful, it is easy to lose two or three tenths of the seedlings. Severely thinned and broken cotton fields may even be abandoned altogether. To achieve this year's cotton leap forward and increased production plan, we must make the greatest efforts to comprehensively do a good job in ensuring seedling survival, guarantee full stands of cotton in every field, and resolutely eliminate the phenomenon of thinned and broken ridges.

Ensuring seedling survival in cotton fields must meet three basic requirements: The first is to ensure full stands; the second is to ensure even stands; and the third is to ensure strong seedlings. Full stands ensure quantity, while even and strong seedlings ensure quality. All three are indispensable. In the past, due to incomplete seedling emergence, uneven seedling retention, and the death of some weak and diseased seedlings after seedling thinning, the actual number of seedlings retained often differed greatly from the planned dense planting number. This is a big loophole. To close this loophole, it is necessary not only to ensure full stands, but also to retain seedlings evenly according to the prescribed plant spacing, and to ensure that each cotton seedling is strong and healthy, so as to ensure that the dense planting requirements planned for each cotton field are fully realized. To this end, we should first strengthen a series of seedling stage management tasks such as seedling inspection, seedling replenishment, seedling thinning, seedling setting, intertillage, and weeding. After cotton sowing, we should always pay attention to checking the soil moisture and the germination and emergence of cotton seeds, and take timely remedial measures according to the specific situation if problems are found in seedling emergence. After seedling emergence, seedling thinning and seedling setting should be carried out as early as possible. In places where seedlings are missing, seedling transplantation should be used to make up for the shortage. Early intertillage, frequent intertillage, and frequent weeding are important measures to promote rapid and healthy cotton seedling emergence. The experience of "hoeing dream flowers" created by the masses – that is, when only a few cotton seedlings have just begun to emerge and the cotton rows can be seen, the first intertillage is carried out between the rows, which can both preserve soil moisture and prevent drought, and increase soil temperature, is an important practice worthy of universal promotion in the work of ensuring seedling survival in cotton fields.

Secondly, it is necessary to thoroughly prevent and control diseases and insect pests. From the time cotton is sown and emerges, it will be constantly attacked by diseases and insect pests. Diseases and insect pests are often the main causes of missing seedlings, broken ridges, and diseased and weak seedlings in cotton fields. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly defeat the enemy of diseases and insect pests. After cotton sowing, we should always pay attention to checking the occurrence of diseases and insect pests, make preparations in all aspects such as insect control machinery, technical training, and labor organization, grasp the favorable time, and launch mass prevention and control. According to the forecasts of relevant scientific research departments, the cotton aphid, the most important pest of cotton seedlings, may occur earlier this year and the damage may be more serious than in the past few years. We must be extra vigilant and prepare to meet the attack early. At present, some agricultural cooperatives in some areas have not prepared insect control machinery, and the supply from supply and marketing cooperatives is also not timely, which should be solved as soon as possible. The most critical time to control cotton aphids is the period before wheat harvest. Because various farm works are concentrated before the wheat harvest, and the labor force is the most strained, the work of universal control of cotton aphids before the wheat harvest was often squeezed out in the past, so that after the wheat harvest, cotton aphids spread and harmed in large numbers. This year, we must make preparations in advance, properly arrange the labor force, and resolutely carry out universal control of cotton aphids one or two times before the wheat harvest, so as to basically eliminate cotton aphids before the wheat harvest. Agricultural cooperatives in key cotton areas should also set up professional insect control organizations in order to carry out timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

Thirdly, seedling topdressing and watering should be carried out appropriately. This year, the water conservancy and fertilizer in cotton fields have increased greatly, which is a very favorable condition. We must make full use of these favorable conditions to play a role in increasing cotton production. Although base fertilizer has been increased in cotton fields this year, it is still necessary to supplement topdressing in stages in a timely manner during the growth period to ensure the healthy development of cotton seedlings. This year, some cotton areas in the north are short of rain and dry, while some cotton areas in the south have excessive rain, which affects the growth of cotton seedlings. It is necessary to vigorously do a good job in irrigation and drainage in cotton fields. Some newly built water conservancy projects have only completed the main projects, and the irrigation and drainage systems in cotton fields have not yet been completed. We must seize the time to repair the ditch system for irrigation and drainage in the fields and give full play to the role of these water conservancy conditions in a timely manner. Cotton field irrigation must master the timely and appropriate irrigation technology to avoid flooding irrigation.

Now, the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production is constantly rising, and the broad masses are fighting against nature with overwhelming momentum. This year, the Party and government leaders in cotton areas have grasped cotton production very tightly, and in many areas, the responsible comrades of the Party committees have personally taken charge, and have already won a great victory in the cotton sowing work. Now we should make persistent efforts to further lead the masses to widely carry out the cotton field seedling inspection and replenishment movement, discover problems through mass inspection and evaluation, solve them in a timely manner, so that the backward can quickly catch up with the advanced, and the advanced can further improve. Agricultural cooperatives should conscientiously implement the "three guarantees and four to the fields" management method, guaranteeing work, guaranteeing production, and guaranteeing costs, and specifying the specific provisions such as output targets, production increase measures, technical quality, and labor work points to each cotton field, and fixing the regular management work of cotton fields to households and individuals, strengthening the responsibility system for cotton field management, and striving for a bumper cotton harvest this year.

### 抓紧棉花保苗这一关

　　抓紧棉花保苗这一关
    全国棉花播种工作，现在已经基本完成。在生产大跃进的高潮中，今年棉花的生产条件有了显著的改变：大部棉田实施了深耕；底肥大量增加；棉田灌溉面积比去年扩大了两倍多；许多主要棉区已经基本上实现了水利化；全面普及了良种，并对棉种进行了粒选、烫种、药剂拌种等处理，加上今年棉花的播种工作动手早，进度快，质量好，都对实现今年的棉花跃进增产计划打下了有利的基础。但是，有了这些好的条件，并不等于丰收。要丰收，还需要从现在开始，作好田间管理工作，特别是要保证棉田全苗、增加每棵棉株的结桃数，促进棉花早熟，——这是争取棉花丰产的三个关键。
    当前，棉田管理的中心工作是保苗。必须保好了苗，棉田丰产才有可靠的基础。今年虽然大部棉田及时趁墒下了种，出苗比较顺利；但也有一些地区或者因为春雨很少，或者因为播种以后气候条件不正常，或者因为播种技术掌握不好，这些棉田出苗都还有一些问题。即使能够整齐出苗的棉田，由于苗期很容易遭到病虫害和不利的气候影响而死亡、损失，出苗后如何让苗长得好，也不是简单的事情。棉田管理上只要稍不注意，很容易就缺两三成苗。缺苗断垅严重的棉田，甚至会整片废弃。要实现今年棉花的跃进增产计划，必须尽最大努力，全面地做好保苗工作，保证块块棉田全苗，坚决消灭缺苗断垅现象。
    棉田保苗必须达到三个基本的要求：第一是保证全苗；第二是保证匀苗；第三是保证壮苗。全苗是保证数量，匀苗、壮苗是保证质量，三者缺一不可。过去往往由于出苗不全，留苗不匀，以及一部分弱苗、病苗在定苗以后死亡，实际留苗数和计划密植数常常相差很多。这是一个大漏洞。要堵塞这个漏洞，不仅要保证全苗，而且要按规定的株距均匀留苗，并保证棉苗棵棵健壮，这样才能保证每块棉田所规划的密植要求不折不扣地实现。为此，首先应该加强查苗、补苗、间苗、定苗、中耕、除草等一系列的苗期管理工作。棉花播种以后，要随时注意检查棉田墒情和棉籽发芽出苗情况，发现出苗有问题的，根据具体情况及时补救。出苗以后，要及早进行间苗、定苗，缺苗的地方，抓紧用移苗的方法来补足。早中耕，勤中耕，勤除草，是促使棉苗出得快、长得好的重要措施。群众创造的“锄梦花”的经验——在棉田刚有少数棉苗开始出土能显出棉行的时候，就在行间进行第一次中耕，既可保墒防旱，又可提高地温，是棉田保苗工作中值得普遍推广的重要做法。
    其次，必须彻底防治病虫害。棉花从播种出苗的时候起，就会不断受到病虫害的侵袭。病虫害常常是造成棉田缺苗断垅和病苗弱苗的主要原因。因此就必须彻底战胜病虫害这个敌人。棉花播种后，要随时注意检查病虫害发生情况，作好治虫药械，技术训练，劳动组织等各方面的准备工作，掌握住有利时机，发动群众性的防治。据有关科学研究部门的预测预报，为害棉苗最主要的棉蚜虫，今年发生时期可能比往年早，为害情况可能比过去几年严重，必须格外警惕，准备提早迎击。目前，还有部分地区的农业社没有准备好治虫药械，供销社供应上也有不及时，应该赶紧设法解决。除治棉蚜最紧要的时机，是麦收前的一段期间。由于麦收前各种农活集中，劳动力最紧张，过去对麦收前普治棉蚜的工作往往被挤掉，以致到了麦收以后，棉蚜就大量蔓延为害。今年我们必须事前作好准备，妥善安排劳动力，坚决做到麦收前普治棉蚜一两遍，将棉蚜基本消灭在麦收以前。重点的棉区农业社，还应设置专业的治虫组织，以便及时地进行病虫害的防治工作。
    第三、要适当进行苗期追肥和浇水的工作。今年棉田的水利和肥料大量增加，这是很有利的条件。要充分运用这些有利的条件，发挥对棉花增产的作用。今年棉田虽然增施了底肥，但还必须在生育期间及时分期补充追肥，才能保证棉苗的健壮发育。今年北方部分棉区缺雨干旱，南方有的棉区则因雨多，影响棉苗生长，必须大力做好棉田灌排工作。有些新兴修的水利，目前只完成了主要的工程，棉田里的灌排系统还没有搞好，必须抓紧时间，将田间灌溉排水的沟渠系统修好，及时发挥这些水利条件的作用。棉田灌溉必须掌握适时适量的灌溉技术，避免大水漫灌。
    现在，农业生产大跃进的高潮正在不断地高涨，广大群众正以排山倒海的声势向自然作斗争。今年棉区党政领导对棉花生产都抓得很紧，许多地区由党委负责同志亲自挂帅，已经在棉花播种工作中打了一个大胜仗。现在应该再接再厉，进一步领导群众广泛开展棉田查苗补苗运动，通过群众性的检查评比来发现问题，及时解决，使落后的迅速赶上先进，先进的更进一步提高。农业社要切实贯彻“三包四到田”的经营管理办法，包工、包产、包成本，将产量指标、增产措施、技术质量、劳动工分等具体规定到每一块棉田，并将棉田的经常管理工作固定到户，到人，加强棉田管理的责任制，力争今年棉花大丰收。
