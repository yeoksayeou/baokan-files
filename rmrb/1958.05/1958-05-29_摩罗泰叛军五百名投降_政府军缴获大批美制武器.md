Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 28th: Lieutenant Colonel Pietjes, commander of the Maluku-West Irian defense zone, told reporters in Jakarta on the evening of the 27th about the situation in North Maluku. Pietjes said that of the three places occupied by rebels on the east coast of Halmahera Island – Morotai, Djailolo, and Tobelo, another major city on Halmahera Island – Morotai had been recovered by government forces, and 500 rebels had surrendered to government forces. Tobelo has been recovered by local police and residents, and Djailolo has been surrounded by government forces. The 400 rebels in this area have lost all contact with the main rebel force in North Sulawesi.

Pietjes said that the government forces have issued a final ultimatum to the rebels in Djailolo, demanding their unconditional surrender; otherwise, government forces will attack them.

Pietjes also said that when government forces recovered Morotai, they seized many brand-new American-made weapons and military equipment, including new anti-aircraft guns. The Indonesian government forces do not possess this kind of modern weaponry.

In other news, government forces had already recovered Baliy, Central Sulawesi, on May 23.

    摩罗泰叛军五百名投降
    政府军缴获大批美制武器
    据新华社雅加达28日电　马鲁古—西伊里安防区司令皮埃特斯中校27日晚间在雅加达告诉记者们关于马鲁古北部的情况。皮埃特斯说，在被叛乱分子占据的哈马黑拉岛东海岸的摩罗泰、济罗罗和哈马黑拉岛的另一主要城市多贝罗三个地方中，摩罗泰已经被政府军收复，有五百名叛军向政府军投降。多贝罗已由当地警察和居民收复，济罗罗已被政府军队包围。这个地方的四百名叛军已经和苏拉威西北部的叛军主力失去一切联系。
    皮埃特斯说，政府军已经向济罗罗的叛乱分子发出最后通牒，要他们无条件投降，否则，政府军队就要向他们进攻。
    皮埃特斯还说，政府军在收复摩罗泰时，缴获了很多全新的美制武器和军事装备，其中包括新式高射炮。印度尼西亚政府军并没有这种现代武器。
    另讯，政府军已经在5月23日收复了中苏拉威西的巴力义。
