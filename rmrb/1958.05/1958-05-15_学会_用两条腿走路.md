　　Learning to "Walk on Two Legs"
　　Wang Xizhang, Deputy Director of the Henan Provincial Department of Education

　　This spring, the people of Henan, with a vigorous revolutionary spirit, broke through the various shackles of dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thought and established more than 37,000 primary schools, enrolling 2.3 million students, enabling more than 93% of school-age children to enter school, basically universalizing primary education. In terms of secondary schools, in the past two months, the masses in various places have established nearly 10,000 junior high schools of various forms, enrolling more than 440,000 students, enabling more than 90% of young people under the age of 20 with a higher primary school education to enter junior high school. The development in these two months has exceeded the figures of the past eight years. Now, all parts of the province have achieved "every township has a middle school, and every commune has a primary school"; some places are even "every commune has a middle school, and every village has a primary school"; even in remote mountainous areas, a new atmosphere of "everyone learning culture and reading everywhere" has emerged. The masses describe it as: "Go to this township, go to that township, every township has a school; go to this village, go to that village, every village has readers; go to this house, go to that house, every household learns culture."
　　This upsurge in cultural education first came about as a result of the promotion of the high tide of industrial and agricultural production. In the high tide of production, the masses put forward many high targets for increased production. In order to achieve these targets, various places launched a series of mass movements such as water conservancy construction and reform of agricultural tools. These movements presented the masses with the urgent task of mastering technology and learning culture. The masses said: "The tractor has come to the countryside, but the culture can't keep up," and "Socialism is paradise, but without culture, you can't go there," and "For the sake of four, five, and eight, we are determined to learn culture." These words vividly reflect the strong demands of the broad masses for science and technology and cultural education in the upsurge of production and construction. Prior to this, some comrades had restricted the development of people-run schools for various reasons, and even disagreed with the masses running schools, and did not recognize the schools that the masses had already established. However, no matter how much they were restricted, the masses insisted on running them. If the public did not recognize them, the masses would run "black schools." This shows that the high tide of cultural education came with the high tide of production and construction, and was not something that anyone could think of casually, nor could anyone stop it.
　　The second reason for the cultural education upsurge is that after the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, the minds of the broad masses of cadres were liberated, enabling the socialist construction line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao to be rapidly implemented, as well as the socialist education policy. Previously, some comrades had been concerned that a large number of young people entering school would affect production, and worried about insufficient funds, lack of teachers, etc. However, due to the correct implementation of the Party's line and policies in various places, the implementation of people-run schools, thrift in running schools, and combining work and study, and attention was paid to the combination of education and production, which solved various difficulties. Facts have proved that the widespread development of schools has not only not hindered production and central work, but has also made production and central work more convenient.
　　The third reason for the cultural education upsurge is the unified leadership of the Party. This spring, all localities have regarded the popularization of education as an integral part of the overall great leap forward centered on industrial and agricultural production, unified planning, unified mobilization, and unified organization and leadership. Therefore, the popularization of education has naturally been integrated with industrial and agricultural production, and has rapidly formed a mass movement.
　　This cultural education upsurge has developed so rapidly for the following reasons: (1) Last spring, Comrade Shaoqi came to Henan and gave us important instructions on issues such as combining work and study and people-run schools. We implemented Comrade Shaoqi's instructions and accumulated some experience in these areas; (2) A large number of cadres were transferred to lower levels, strengthening grassroots organizations and bringing culture to the countryside; (3) Henan Province originally had tens of thousands of primary and secondary schools and people-run schools, forming a school network and forming a base for development.
　　The high tide of production requires the rapid development of education to serve itself. Now it seems that the massive establishment of various people-run schools and the widespread launch of the literacy campaign have indeed brought very significant and favorable factors to production and construction. In many places, after becoming literate, farmers then study cultural knowledge courses directly related to production, organize various technical research groups, and experiment with new technologies in agriculture, which has powerfully promoted production. Many people-run schools, after being built, quickly became a powerful tool for townships and communes to conduct political and ideological education and promote central work. The commune cadres of Yancheng County said: "The students of the people-run middle schools are the shock troops of our propaganda, the technicians of production, the good accountants of cooperatives, and the little teachers in the people-run schools; with the people-run middle schools, things will be easier to handle in the future." The broad masses in many places also reflect that people-run schools combine production, facilitate the masses, and students, parents, cadres, and commune members are all satisfied.
　　In popularizing primary schools and developing middle schools, all localities have adopted the method of Party committee leadership, mobilizing the masses, focusing on experiments, comprehensively promoting, igniting a fire in one place, and blooming everywhere in a mass movement. The forms of schools are flexible and diverse, including full-day, half-day, every-other-day, two-part system, compound classes, morning school, night school, spare-time school, remedial school, and in mountainous areas, there are also mobile schools and one-stop schools, etc. In terms of curriculum, most have four or five subjects, including Chinese, mathematics, politics, and general knowledge of agriculture.
　　In terms of teachers, they are generally selected locally, and their sources are mostly intellectuals in the countryside, demobilized soldiers, and cadres transferred to lower levels. When the masses choose teachers, they have quite strict requirements for political quality, and the level of education must also be competent. The salaries of teachers are mostly paid by students in work points or by the commune in work points, and the standard is generally not lower than that of strong labor and not higher than that of the main cadres of the commune.
　　In terms of school buildings and equipment, they are all simple and make use of vacant rooms, and some of the desks and stools are brought by the students themselves. Due to the implementation of thrift in running schools, very little start-up capital is spent. The primary and secondary school classes run in Yancheng County this spring only used more than 200 yuan for start-up costs, averaging 2 jiao 3 fen per class. The funding for schools, the senior grades of primary schools and people-run junior high schools, all adopt the method of combining work and study and half-work and half-study, which is solved by the students' labor production themselves, without relying on the state or cooperatives, nor relying on families.
　　In terms of textbooks, in addition to a part supplied by Xinhua Bookstore, many places are self-compiled, self-selected, and self-printed, and students are mobilized to borrow from each other.
　　This time, the popularization of primary schools and the development of middle schools were carried out in a large mass movement, and crude phenomena are naturally unavoidable. According to preliminary understanding, there are still many problems in schools in various places. The most important thing is that some schools still have formalistic ideas, and in terms of curriculum and teaching, they have not been completely practical and closely integrated with production; at the beginning, we did not clearly propose to run vocational middle schools, so that some places only considered the requirements of ordinary middle schools, and did not think of "walking on two legs." Secondly, some teachers' professional thinking is not yet solid, their business is still very unfamiliar, and their cultural level is still relatively low. The third is that we still lack the necessary rules and regulations for people-run schools, and the distribution of the school network is not completely proper, etc. From these situations, although the schools have been established, how to consolidate and improve them in the future is still a very arduous task. In addition, although so many schools have been developed in various places this spring, they still cannot meet the needs. After the summer vacation, there are still more than 500,000 higher primary school graduates who need to enter junior high school or participate in production labor. At the same time, primary schools have been popularized, junior high schools have been developed, and senior high schools and universities must also be developed accordingly. These tasks are also very heavy.
　　Regarding the issue of consolidation and improvement and how to move forward in the future, the Party committees in various places have begun to pay attention to it after popularization, and have explored some methods. Summarizing the experiences of various places, the most important points are as follows:
　　First, continue to vigorously implement the education policy put forward by Chairman Mao, further criticize dogmatism and formalistic thinking, so that the newly established schools can truly be closely integrated with current production and central work, and learn to "walk on two legs." According to the characteristics and needs of local production, many places have changed the newly built people-run ordinary middle schools into agricultural middle schools, forestry middle schools, fishery middle schools, and other vocational middle schools. What is required in the current production of townships and communes is taught, and what is the central work, what is taught in the political class, which is welcomed by all parties. This is an important link in consolidating people-run schools.
　　Second, strengthen the political and ideological education of teachers. Various localities have adopted methods such as carrying out airing of views, debates, and absorbing teachers to participate in Red and Expert schools among teachers to improve teachers' ideological awareness and consolidate professional thinking; and building Party and League organizations among teachers, expanding the Party's ranks, and strengthening the Party's leadership. These are also important links in consolidating and improving people-run schools.
　　Strengthen business counseling for teachers. Various localities have adopted methods such as organizing teachers to participate in business training, establishing a teaching counseling network, establishing a counseling system, having old teachers lead new teachers, and organizing people-run teachers to visit and attend classes in public schools regularly, so that new teachers in people-run schools can learn, teach, and improve at the same time. These experiences are also very important.
　　Third, adjust the school network to facilitate students' enrollment as much as possible.
　　Fourth, establish and improve the management institutions of people-run schools, and gradually formulate and improve various necessary rules and regulations.
　　In the process of popularizing education, our most important experience is to rely on the leadership of the Party, earnestly follow the mass line, and conscientiously implement the Party's line and policies. Now, in the issue of consolidation and improvement, the same must be done. The most important issue at present is to prevent a mood of relaxation and hesitation when encountering difficulties. In order to do a good job in the work after popularization, in addition to conducting in-depth inspections recently, various localities have also proposed to continue to muster enough energy, be down-to-earth, work hard for several years, run the newly developed people-run schools well, greatly improve the teaching quality of existing schools, and at the same time, appropriately develop a number of public middle schools (especially senior high schools) and specialized schools. Some local party committees plan to run agricultural, industrial, medical, normal, and other higher vocational schools in the next few years. In order to completely change the face of Henan's culture and education, and adapt to the new situation of technological revolution and cultural revolution, we will, in accordance with the principle of combining popularization and improvement, start from the existing foundation and continue to work hard towards the great goal of cultural revolution.

　　学会“用两条腿走路”
　　河南省教育厅副厅长　王锡璋
    今年春季，河南人民以轰轰烈烈的革命精神，冲破了教条主义和右倾保守思想的各种束缚，办起了小学三万七千多所，吸收了学生二百三十万人，使学龄儿童93％以上都进了学校，基本上普及了小学教育；在中学方面，两个月来各地群众举办了各种形式的初中近一万所，吸收了学生四十四万多人，使二十岁以下的具有高小毕业程度的青年90％以上都进了初中。今年两个月的发展超过了过去八年发展的数字。现在，全省各地已经做到了“乡乡有中学，社社有小学”；有些地方甚至已经是“社社有中学，村村有小学”；连深山僻壤也都出现了“人人学文化，处处读书声”的新气象。群众描绘说：“走这乡，到那乡，乡乡有学堂；走这村，到那村，村村都是读书人；走这家，到那家，家家户户学文化”。
    这次文化教育高潮首先是由于工农业生产高潮的推动而到来的。在生产高潮中，群众提出了许多高额的增产指标，为了实现这些指标，各地开展了兴修水利、改革工具农具等一系列的群众性的运动。这些运动向群众提出了掌握技术、学习文化的迫切任务。群众说：“拖拉机下了乡，就是文化赶不上”，“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”，又说：“为了四、五、八，坚决学文化”。这些话生动地反映了在生产建设的高潮中广大群众对科学技术和文化教育的强烈要求。在此以前，有些同志曾以种种理由对民办学校进行限制，甚至不同意群众办学，不承认群众已经办起来的学校。但是，尽管怎样限制，群众还是坚持要办，公家不承认，群众就办“黑学”。这说明文化教育的高潮是随着生产建设的高潮而来的，并不是什么人随便想出来的，也不是任何人可以阻止得住的。
    促成文化教育高潮的第二个原因是，经过整风反右派斗争以后，广大干部的思想获得了解放，使党中央和毛主席提出的多、快、好、省的社会主义建设路线与社会主义的教育方针迅速地得到了贯彻。以前，有些同志曾经顾虑大量青年入学会影响生产，并担心经费不足，师资缺乏等等。但是，由于各地正确地贯彻了党的方针政策，实行了群众办学、勤俭办学、勤工俭学，注意了教育与生产的结合，这就使各种困难迎刃而解。事实证明：学校的普遍发展，不仅没有妨碍生产和中心工作，而且更加便利了生产和中心工作。
    促成文化教育高潮的第三个原因是党的统一领导。今春，各地都是把普及教育作为以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的一个组成部分，统一规划，统一动员，统一组织领导，因此，普及教育也就很自然地和工农业生产结成了一体，迅速地形成了群众性的运动。
    这次文化教育高潮，发展如此迅速，还有以下几个原因：（1）去年春季少奇同志到河南，就勤工俭学，群众办学等问题对我们作了重要指示，我们贯彻了少奇同志的指示，因而在这些方面积累了一些经验；（2）大量干部下放，加强了基层组织，并把文化带到了农村；（3）河南省原有十数万所中小学和民校，结成了学校网，形成了发展的基地。
    生产高潮要求教育事业迅速发展来为自己服务，现在看来，各种民办学校的大量建立和扫盲运动的普遍开展，确实已为生产建设带来了非常显著的有利因素，很多地方的农民在扫盲后接着就学习与生产直接有关的文化知识课程，组织各种技术研究组，试验农业上的新技术，有力地推动了生产，许多民办学校建起之后，很快就成了乡社进行政治思想教育、推动中心工作的得力工具。郾城县的社干部说：
  “民办中学的学生是我们宣传上的突击队，生产上的技术员，合作社的好会计，民校里的小先生；有了民办中学今后事情就好办了。”许多地方的广大群众也反映，民办学校结合生产，便利群众，学生、家长、干部、社员，人人满意。
    在普及小学和发展中学时，各地都是采取了党委领导，发动群众，重点试验，全面推广，一处点火，到处开花的群众运动的方式，在学校的形式上是灵活多样的，有整日制、半日制、隔日制、二部制、复式班，有早校、夜学、业余学校、补习学校，在山区还有巡回学校、一揽子学校等等。在课程设置上，多数是四门或五门，有语文、数学、政治、农业常识等。
    在师资方面，一般都是就地取材，其来源大都是在乡里的知识分子、转业军人、下放干部。群众选择教师时，对政治质量的要求相当严格，文化程度也要能够胜任。教师待遇多数是由学生缴工分或由社记工分，其标准一般不低于强劳动力，不高于社的主要干部。
    在校舍设备方面，都是因陋就简，利用空房，桌凳有些是学生自带。由于实行了勤俭办学，开办费花的很少。郾城县今春举办的中小学班，开办费只用了二百多元，每班平均两角三分。学校的经费，小学高年级和民办初中，都是采用勤工俭学、半工半读的办法，由学生劳动生产自己解决，既不依靠国家和合作社，也不依靠家庭。
    在课本方面，除新华书店供应一部分外，很多地方都是自编、自选、自印，并发动学生，互相借用。
    这次普及小学和发展中学是在大的群众运动中进行的，粗糙现象自然难免。根据初步了解，各地学校存在的问题都还很多。最主要的是，有些学校还存在着正规化的思想，在课程、教学等方面，未能完全切合实际，密切结合生产；开始时，我们没有明确提出举办职业中学，以致有些地方还只是根据普通中学的要求来考虑问题，没有想到“用两条腿来走路”。其次，有些教师专业思想还不巩固，业务还很生疏，文化水平也还较低。再次是，对民办学校我们还缺乏必要的规章制度，以及学校网的分布还不够完全妥善等等。从这些情况来看，学校虽然建立起来了，但今后如何巩固提高，还是非常艰巨的任务。此外，今春各地虽然发展了这样多的学校，但仍不能满足需要，暑假后还有五十多万高小毕业生需要升入初中或参加生产劳动。同时，小学普及了，初中发展了，高中和大学也必须相应发展，这些任务也都十分繁重。
    对于巩固提高和今后如何前进的问题，各地党委在普及后就已开始注意，并且摸索到了一些办法，综合各地的经验，最主要的有以下几点：
    第一、继续大力贯彻毛主席提出的教育方针，进一步批判教条主义和正规化思想，使新办起的学校切实做到与当前生产和中心工作密切结合，并且学会“用两条腿走路”。不少地方根据本地生产的特点和需要，把新建的民办普通中学改成了农业中学、林业中学、渔业中学和其他性质的职业中学。当前乡社生产上要求什么就教什么，中心工作是什么，政治课就讲什么，受到了各方面的欢迎。这是巩固民办学校的一个重要环节。
    第二、加强对教师的政治思想教育。各个地方采取了在教师中开展鸣放、争辩和吸收教师参加红专学校等办法，来提高教师的思想觉悟，巩固专业思想；并在教师中建党建团，扩大党的队伍，加强党的领导。这一些，也是巩固提高民办学校的重要环节。
    加强对教师的业务辅导。各个地方采取了组织教师参加业务进修，建立教学辅导网，订立辅导制度，以老教师带新教师，组织民办教师定期到公立学校参观听课等办法，使民办学校的新教师能够边教边学边提高。这些经验，也都十分重要。
    第三、调整学校网，尽量便利学生入学。
    第四、建立和健全民办学校的管理机构，逐步制订和改进各种必要的规章制度。
    在普及教育的过程中，我们最主要的经验是依靠党的领导，认真走群众路线，切实贯彻执行党的方针政策，现在，在巩固提高的问题上，也同样必须如此。当前最主要的问题是要防止松劲情绪和遇到困难时犹疑动摇。为了把普及以后的工作做好，最近各地除正在进行深入的检查外，并且提出要继续鼓足干劲，踏踏实实，苦战数年，把新发展起来的民办学校办好，把现有学校的教学质量大大提高，同时再适当地发展一批公立中学（特别是高中）和专科学校。有些地委计划在最近几年就要办起农业、工业、医学、师范等高等专科学校。为了彻底改变河南文化教育的面貌，适应技术革命和文化革命的新形势，我们将本着普及与提高相结合的方针，从现有基础上出发，继续向着文化革命的伟大目标努力前进。
