　　When you participate in the long jump or high jump at a sports meet, and jump into that soft sand pit, have you ever wondered: What kind of thing is sand?

　　"Sand is the loosest thing!" I am afraid everyone will answer this way. Yes, sand is a powdery mineral particle, and it does not seem to bear any force at all. However, after treatment, sand can be harder than stone. In civil engineering, sand is one of the cheapest and most effective reinforcing materials. Mortar for brick walls and concrete, which has a very wide range of applications, both use sand as a filler. Not only that, but in many places in our country, advanced Soviet experience has been adopted to use sand as the foundation on weak ground, building houses on top of the sand to replace wood, cement, steel, and stone, greatly reducing costs and ensuring quality. After this experience was successfully adopted in Northeast China in 1954, many regions widely adopted this method.

　　Sand looks very soft, but it solidifies quickly after being compacted. Generally, sand foundations no longer settle after the house is built. Because sand is a loose particle, it is buried in the foundation trenches under the house and is not bonded into a single block by other materials. Therefore, it can not only transmit the weight of the superstructure to the soil layer below the foundation, but also distribute the load to the soil on both sides of the foundation, and the distribution is very even. This is where the superior performance of the sand foundation lies. Why can sand distribute the load evenly? Let's use an analogy! If you put a square stone or concrete block in a paper bag and place it on a table, and then add pressure, the stone in the paper bag bears the weight pressing down on it and transmits it to the bottom, but the paper bag around it is not affected by the pressure; if the paper bag is filled with sand, the situation is different. Sand not only transmits the pressure to the bottom, but also distributes the pressure to the surrounding paper bag, and may even burst the paper bag. This is because the sand distributes the load from above to the side. Of course, the side of the sand foundation is soil, which will not be squeezed and broken like a paper bag, but this also illustrates that sand foundations and general foundations are different when bearing pressure.

　　Since the sand foundation can distribute the upper load to the soil on both sides of the foundation, it greatly reduces the pressure borne by the soil under the foundation. In this way, not only can the width and depth of the foundation be reduced, reducing construction costs; but also the settlement of the building is reduced. If the soil under the foundation is of different hardness, uneven settlement is likely to occur with a general foundation: some places settle more, some places settle less, and cracks will appear in the walls on the ground. Using sand as the foundation can overcome this defect and ensure the quality of the building. Experience has shown that sand foundations have good results even on soft soils with very poor bottom soil quality, such as silt, alluvial soil, swamp soil, and peat. It cannot be used only in foundations with flowing groundwater, because flowing groundwater will wash away the sand particles, affecting quality.

　　The construction method of making a sand foundation is very simple. Just pour the washed sand into the foundation trench, pour water, vibrate, compact, or use a vibrator to compact it. After the sand is compacted, there are few gaps, and brick walls can be built on it to build tall buildings.

    当你在运动会上跳远或跳高，跳进那软绵绵的砂坑的时候，你有没有想过：砂是怎么样的一种东西呢？
    “砂是最松散的东西！”恐怕大家都会这样回答。不错，砂是一种粉末状的矿物颗粒，看起来一点也不着力。可是，砂在经过处理以后，却比石块还要坚硬。在土木工程方面，砂是最廉价、最有效的加固材料之一。砌砖墙用的砂浆、应用范围非常广的混凝土，都要用砂做填充料。不但如此，目前我国很多地方，还采用了苏联的先进经验，在软弱的地基上，用砂做基础，把房屋造在砂的上面，用来代替木材、水泥、钢材和石料，大大降低了造价，而且能保证质量。这个经验从1954年在我国东北地区采用成功后，很多地区都广泛采用这个办法。
    砂看起来很松软，捣实以后，固结却很快。一般的砂基础在房屋造好以后，就不再沉陷。因为砂是疏散的颗粒，它被埋在房屋底下基础的沟槽里，并没有被其它材料粘结成一个整块，因此它不但能把上层建筑物的重量传达到基础下面的土层，还能把荷重分散在基础两边的土壤上，而且分布的很均匀，这就是砂基础性能优越的地方。为什么砂能把荷重分散均匀呢？打一个比方吧！如果在一只纸袋里放一块方整的石块或混凝土块，放在桌上，上面再加压力，纸袋里的石块承受上面压下来的重量，并把它传布到底层，但在它四周的纸袋，不受到压力的影响；如果纸袋里盛的是砂，情况就不同，砂不但把压力传布到底层，同时把压力分散到四周的纸袋上，甚至会挤破纸袋。这就是砂把上面的荷重分散到旁边去了的缘故。当然，砂基础的旁边是土壤，它不会像纸袋一样地被挤破，不过这也说明了砂基础和一般基础在承受压力时是不同的。
    既然砂基础能把上层荷重分散在基础两边的土壤里，因而就大大减低了基础下面土壤所承受的压力。这样，不但可以减少基础的宽度和深度，使造价降低；而且也减少了建筑物的沉陷。如果基础下面的土壤软硬不同，做一般的基础很容易发生不均匀的沉陷：有的地方沉得多，有的地方沉得少，地面上的墙壁就会发生裂缝。用砂作基础，便能克服这个缺陷，保证了建筑物的质量。经验证明，即便在底层土质很差的淤泥、冲积土、沼泽土、泥煤等软弱的土壤上，采用砂基础都有良好的效果。只是在有流动的地下水的基础才不能使用，因为流动的地下水会冲走砂粒，影响质量。
    做砂基础的施工方法很简单，只要把洗净的砂倾倒在做基础的沟槽里，灌水、震动、捣实，或用震动器震实。砂密实以后，很少空隙，即可在上面砌筑砖墙，盖起高楼大厦。
