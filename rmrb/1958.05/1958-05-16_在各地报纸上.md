The instructions stipulate that the guiding principle for cultivation is to use local materials, rely on self-reliance, conduct multiple trainings, gradually improve, learn while doing, be both red and expert, serve industrial and agricultural production, and promote continuous leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. As for the training targets, they are to select young men and women with socialist ideology, aged between eighteen and thirty, with primary school education or above, from grassroots organizations in various systems and industries, and select personnel with special skills or rich production experience from workers and peasants for training, and vigorously organize them to impart technology. The training personnel include five aspects: agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, medical and health, and local industry.

　　The Henan Daily on the 13th prominently publicized the issue of focusing on "virtual" matters. The front-page headline reported on the recent debate on work principles and rules and regulations carried out by the Provincial Department of Commerce. They adopted the approach of focusing on "virtual" matters first and then on "real" matters, using the "virtual" to drive the "real," and combining the "virtual" and the "real," conducting debates on the opinions raised by the masses during the rectification campaign, and changing unreasonable rules and regulations. It also reported the news that the direct organs of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China had launched a rectification upsurge by fully focusing on "virtual" matters. The newspaper also published an editorial entitled "Why Emphasize 'Virtual' Matters?" which commented on the practices of the Department of Commerce, pointed out the significance of focusing on "virtual" matters and the relationship between "virtual" and "real," and explained the importance of strengthening political and ideological work and thoroughly liberating the mind.
