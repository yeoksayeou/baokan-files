　　Strange Spring Water
　　In the Hulunbuir Grassland of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there is a strange spring called "Uni Arshan". When the spring water gushes out, it is clear and crystal, but the soil it flows over is rust-colored, like orange-yellow iron rust. The water has a pungent smell like soda water. People treat it as the best beverage, drinking seven or eight cups at a time without feeling bloated. If it is put into a bottle, the gas emitted from the water will pop the lid open. It is said that the spring water can aid digestion. People who feel uncomfortable from overeating will want to eat again soon after drinking a few cups. It is especially effective in treating stomach and intestinal diseases, nervous disorders, and the like. Many cadres in the Solon Banner have used the spring water to cure their ailments.
　　The local herdsmen of all ethnic groups like this place the most. Every year in the warm months of May and June, they drive their cattle and sheep, bring their yurts, and gather here from all directions to treat illnesses or escape the summer heat.
　　It is generally speculated that a mineral deposit may be buried under this spring, requiring scientific exploration. (Xinhua News Agency)

　　奇异的泉水
    内蒙古自治区呼伦贝尔草原上，有一眼奇异的泉水叫“乌尼阿尔山”。泉水涌出来时，清彻晶莹，但流过地方的泥土却如铁锈一样呈橙黄色。泉水有汽水一样熏鼻的味道，人们把它当做最好的饮料，一次喝上七八杯，也不感觉肚胀，如果装入瓶内，水里发出的汽会把瓶盖顶开。据说，泉水能帮助消化，因过食而不舒适的人喝上几杯后，不久又想吃东西。它特别能治疗肠胃病、神经病等。索伦旗不少机关干部都利用泉水医好自己的病痛。
    附近各族牧民最喜欢这个地方。每到风和日暖的5、6月份，他们就赶着牛羊，带着蒙古包，从四面八方集中到这里来医治疾病或避暑。
    据一般人推测，这个泉水下边可能埋藏着一种矿物，需要进行科学的探查。　（新华社）
