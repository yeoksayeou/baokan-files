Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from Paris: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued an urgent appeal on the evening of the 29th, calling on all working people, all democrats, and all patriots to "be vigilant at all times and strongly counterattack every conspiracy of the fascists."

The Central Committee pointed out that President of the Republic Coty's forced nomination of De Gaulle as head of government by the National Assembly is intolerable. Because the pro-republican majority has repeatedly demonstrated in votes that they refuse to lead the country into the danger of civil war, and the will to defend the republican system is also growing throughout the country.

On the afternoon of the same day, after Coty's letter regarding the decision to invite De Gaulle to form a new government was read in the National Assembly, the French Communist Party's parliamentary group issued a statement condemning all attempts to bring De Gaulle to power, regardless of the form these attempts take.

The statement said that just as the rioters in Algeria and civil war instigators like Massu are attempting to bring De Gaulle to power through a military coup, the President's act of forcing the National Assembly to accept De Gaulle as head of government will inevitably push the country into civil war. The statement emphasized that there is no other way to avoid civil war at present except to adhere to the law and the Constitution.

The statement reiterated that France currently needs a government that defends the Republic, and the establishment of this government should be based on the principles of the Constitution and based on the Republican majority in the National Assembly and the Republican state.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 29th dispatch: The Administrative Committee of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communique after the 500,000-person anti-fascist demonstration in Paris on the 28th, calling on the working people to prepare for further action to defend the Republic and defend freedom.

The communique said that the large-scale demonstration held by the working people of Paris and all republicans demonstrated a spirit of unity and their unwavering determination to oppose the establishment of any personal dictatorship. The voices of the working class and the people have aroused extremely broad repercussions.

The communique pointed out that some people are currently plotting and scheming to bring De Gaulle to power through more or less legal means, so the threat to the Republic and freedom is extremely serious. The General Confederation of Labor called on workers to continue to consolidate and expand unity, hold demonstrations like the one held in Paris in all cities and villages, and establish more anti-fascist committees in enterprises and localities. The General Confederation of Labor called on the working class and all republicans to be ready to respond in unison to all calls that may be issued depending on the development of the situation.

On the same day, the National Federation of Republican Reserve Officers, headed by General Bertie, and the Federation of Republican Reserve Non-Commissioned Officers, headed by Captain Guy, issued a letter to all French soldiers, which said: "From now on, every soldier is responsible for the destiny of France. At this critical moment, the duty and honor of every reserve or active officer, sergeant, and soldier is not to collude with the rebels, no matter how much power the rebels seize. Soldiers should and should only obey the Republican government."

    准备反击法西斯的进攻
    法共号召人民随时警戒
    法总工会要求劳动人民准备采取进一步行动
    新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：法国共产党中央委员会29日傍晚发出紧急呼吁，号召全体劳动人民、全体民主人士和全体爱国者“随时处于警戒状态，针对法西斯分子的每一个阴谋给予强有力的回击”。
    中央委员会指出，共和国总统戈蒂出面强制国民议会提名戴高乐为政府首脑的作法是不能容忍的。因为拥护共和的多数派已经在屡次投票中表明它们拒绝把国家带进内战的危险中，同时保卫共和政体的意志也在全国各地日益加强。
    在同一天的下午，在国民议会宣读戈蒂关于决定邀请戴高乐组织新政府的信件以后，法国共产党议会党团发表声明，谴责一切旨在让戴高乐上台的企图，不管这种企图采取什么形式。
    声明说，正当阿尔及利亚的暴乱和内战煽动者马絮之流妄图经由军事政变使戴高乐上台的时候，总统这种强迫国民议会接受戴高乐为政府首脑的作法不可避免地会把国家推入内战。声明着重指出，目前除了坚持法律和宪法之外，别无其他途径可以避免内战。
    声明重申，法国目前需要一个保卫共和的政府，这个政府的建立应当依据宪法的原则并且以国民议会的共和多数派和共和国家为基础。
    新华社巴黎29日电　法国总工会行政委员会在28日巴黎五十万人反法西斯示威游行以后发表公报，号召劳动人民准备采取进一步行动，保卫共和国，保卫自由。
    公报说，巴黎劳动人民和所有共和人士举行的大规模的示威游行表现了团结一致的精神和他们反对建立任何个人独裁的不可动摇的决心，工人阶级和人民的呼声已经引起了极其广大的反响。
    公报指出，目前有人正在施展阴谋诡计，企图使戴高乐通过或多或少合法的途径上台，因此危及共和国和自由的威胁极为严重，总工会号召劳动者继续巩固和扩大团结，在所有城市和乡村中举行像在巴黎举行的示威游行，在企业中和地方上成立更多的反法西斯委员会。总工会要求工人阶级和所有共和人士随时准备一致响应可能依据局势发展而发出的一切号召。
    同一天，以柏蒂将军为首的共和后备军官全国联合会和以盖伊大尉为首的共和后备士官联合会发表了告法国全体军人书，其中说：“从现在起，每个军人都要对法国的命运负责。在这紧急的关头每个备役或现役军官、军士和士兵的天职和荣誉就是不要与叛乱分子同流合污，不管叛乱分子夺得多大的权力。军人应该而且也只应该服从共和政体。”
