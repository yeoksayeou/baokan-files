Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 24th. The Tianjin Wool, Hemp, and Silk Textile Industry Bureau has broken the mystical view of running universities and recently established its own wool, hemp, and silk industrial specialized school.

This is the first formal higher industrial specialized school run by an industrial enterprise unit in Tianjin. It is divided into three specialty classes: wool textile, knitting, and dyeing and finishing. It mainly enrolls outstanding workers with a junior high school education and more than five years of work experience, and plans to train them into technical personnel with engineer-level skills equivalent to university graduates within five years. Based on the principle of learning what is needed, the school has decided to spend one and a half years completing the high school curriculum and three and a half years completing professional knowledge. During the entire learning process, students will spend about half of their time participating in the research, design, and trial production of new products, as well as the process design and machine installation of new factories. This combination of work and study, learning and application, will enable students to combine theory and practice and avoid long-term separation from productive labor. In addition to some engineering and technical personnel from the bureau, the school's professional course teachers have also received support from relevant universities.

The school has decided to enroll students year by year, with a total of 1,250 students to be enrolled by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. The first batch of 181 students are all production workers and cadres familiar with production from various factories under the bureau.

The Tianjin Wool, Hemp, and Silk Textile Industry Bureau will build and expand many factories in the next few years, but the existing technical force is weak and cannot meet the needs of production development. Among the technical talents allocated by the state from colleges and universities, there are very few who study wool textile, and there are no knitting majors at all. After the bureau's leadership criticized the idea of relying solely on state allocation for technical strength and broke the mystical view of running universities, it quickly established this school.

The school is located in an old factory. The classrooms are former factory buildings and warehouses, and the students used their own hands to knock down partitions and paint the walls.

    打破办大学的神秘观点
    天津毛麻丝局创办专科学校
    新华社天津24日电　天津市毛麻丝纺织工业局打破办大学的神秘观点，最近自办了一所毛麻丝工业专科学校。
    这个天津市工业企业单位自办的第一所正规高等工业专科学校，共分毛纺织、针织、染整三个专业班，主要招收初中程度、有五年以上工龄的优秀工人入学，预定在五年内把他们培养成为相当大学毕业程度的具有工程师水平的技术人员。根据需要什么学什么的原则，这个学校确定用一年半的时间学完高中课程，三年半时间学完专业知识。学生在整个学习过程中，将有一半左右时间参加新产品的研究、设计、试制和新建工厂的工艺设计、机器安装等工作。这样半工半读，边学边用，将使学生理论和实践相结合，不至于长期脱离生产劳动。学校的专业课教师除一部分由这个局的工程技术人员担任外，还得到了有关高等院校的支援。
    这个学校决定逐年招生，到第二个五年计划末期共可招学生一千二百五十人。第一期入学的有一百八十一人，都是这个局所属各厂的生产工人和熟悉生产的干部。
    天津市毛麻丝纺织工业局在今后几年中要新建和扩建很多工厂，而现有的技术力量薄弱，不能满足生产发展的需要。国家分配的高等学校的技术人才中，学毛纺织专业的很少，针织专业则根本没有。这个局领导上批判了技术力量单纯依靠国家分配的思想，又打破了办高等学校的神秘观点以后，就把这所学校很快地办起来。
    这个学校设在一个旧工厂里，教室是过去的厂房和仓库，学生们用自己的双手打开断间，粉饰了墙壁。
