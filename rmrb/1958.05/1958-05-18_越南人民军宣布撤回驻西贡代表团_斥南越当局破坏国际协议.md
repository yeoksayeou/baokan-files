    Vietnam People's Army Announces Withdrawal of Saigon Delegation
    Accuses South Vietnamese Authorities of Violating International Agreements
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army issued a statement today regarding the withdrawal of the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation stationed in Saigon, stating that the South Vietnamese authorities must bear full responsibility for the inability of the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation to continue working in Saigon.

    The statement said that the South Vietnamese authorities' opposition to the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation in Saigon is a blatant violation of the agreements signed by both parties. The result of the South Vietnamese authorities' actions has exposed their true colors to the people: they are plotting to permanently divide Vietnamese territory and attempting to turn South Vietnam into a colony and military base for American imperialism.

    The General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army announced that the South Vietnamese authorities have an obligation to fulfill the protocol signed on March 31, 1955, by the Vietnam People's Army and the French Federation forces, which also represented the South Vietnamese authorities at the time. The protocol stipulated that both parties would send delegations to the International Commission. The statement pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities have an obligation to fully implement all the Geneva Accords.

    The statement expressed that the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army, together with the people of the entire country, will make unremitting efforts to improve relations between North and South Vietnam, to enable both parties to resume sending liaison delegations to the International Commission, and to ensure the complete implementation of the Geneva Accords.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 17th - The Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation stationed in Saigon, led by Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Van Long, consisting of sixteen people, returned to Hanoi by special plane this afternoon from Saigon. They were recalled by the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army after the South Vietnamese authorities recently openly announced that they would refuse to assume any responsibility for this liaison delegation.

    Nguyen Van Long delivered a speech at Gia Lam Airport, accusing the South Vietnamese authorities of various persecutions against the delegation over the past three years. He said that even on the eve of the delegation's departure from Saigon, the South Vietnamese authorities sent hooligans and thugs to provoke the delegation.

    The Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation stationed in Saigon traveled from Hanoi to Saigon on May 17, 1955, exactly three years before returning today. Since the withdrawal of French troops from South Vietnam in April 1956, the delegation has been constantly threatened and persecuted by South Vietnamese military police and secret agents controlled by the United States. Their residence has been attacked with grenades, and two delegation members have been injured by secret agents using hammers in sneak attacks. They were unable to go out to buy food for a full month and a half due to the deliberate obstruction of the South Vietnamese authorities.

    越南人民军宣布撤回驻西贡代表团
　　斥南越当局破坏国际协议
    据新华社河内17日电　越南人民军总司令部今天就撤回越南人民军驻西贡联络代表团一事发表的声明指出，南越当局必须对越南人民军联络代表团不能继续留驻西贡工作负全部责任。
    声明说，南越当局反对越南人民军驻西贡联络代表团的行为是对双方所签订的协议的明目张胆的破坏。南越当局这样作的结果已经在人民面前暴露了自己的真面目，它们阴谋长期分裂越南国土，妄图把越南南方变为美帝国主义的殖民地和军事基地。
    越南人民军总司令部宣布，南越当局有义务履行越南人民军和当时也代表南越当局的法兰西联邦部队在1955年3月31日签订的议定书。议定书规定了双方派出代表团驻国际委员会。声明指出，南越当局有彻底履行全部日内瓦协议的义务。
    声明表示，越南人民军总司令部将同全国人民一起，为北南双方的关系获得改善，为双方能够恢复派驻国际委员会的联络代表团，为日内瓦协议获得彻底的实施而进行不懈的斗争。
    据新华社河内17日电　以阮文隆中校为首的越南人民军驻西贡联络代表团一行十六人今天下午从西贡乘专机回到河内。他们是在南越当局最近公然宣布拒绝对这个联络代表团承担一切责任之后由越南人民军总司令部召回的。
    阮文隆在嘉林机场发表讲话，指责南越当局三年来对代表团进行的种种迫害。他说，甚至在代表团离西贡前夕，南越当局还派流氓、暴徒向代表团寻衅。
    越南人民军驻西贡联络代表团是在1955年5月17日从河内前往西贡的，离今天回来恰好是三年。从1956年4月法军撤出南越后，代表团经常受到美国操纵的南越宪兵、特务的威胁和迫害。他们的住处受到过手榴弹的袭击，两名代表团人员曾经被特务用铁锤偷袭受伤。他们曾因南越当局的故意阻难而有整整一个半月不能外出购买食品。
