Xinhua News Agency, 18th: More than 1.2 million voters in Beijing's urban area went to four hundred polling stations today to elect district people's representatives.

Beijing's urban area was in a festive mood today. Streets were filled with colorful flags and huge slogans calling on voters to vote enthusiastically. At dawn, the whole city began to boil. Cheerful crowds beat gongs and drums and flocked to the polling stations. Yu Chunhe, a national model worker and bricklayer from the Beijing No. 2 Construction Engineering Company, wore his medal and rushed to the Dongbianmen electoral district polling station to cast the first vote. Chen Fengyuan, a voter from the Xiaotianshui South electoral district who had just turned eighteen, arrived at the polling station at one o'clock in the morning to wait, in order to cast the first vote of her life. Yang Jingru, a sixty-five-year-old voter living in Xiangluying Fourth Alley, cast the first vote in both the 1953 and 1956 elections. This morning, she rushed to the polling station at two o'clock and cast the first vote for the third time.

Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Beijing, as well as many responsible persons from central agencies and Beijing, voted together with voters at the polling stations today.

This election in Beijing implemented the spirit of the rectification campaign. Voters used the methods of extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and extensive debates to discuss the electoral system and electoral work, and conducted serious interviews and evaluations of the candidates for representatives. Employees of the jointly owned Yihua Musical Instrument Factory voted with particular excitement today. Two years ago, Zhang Huanyao, the private factory director of the factory, deceived the people's trust and was elected as a people's representative. Last year, his rightist face was exposed, and the employees waged a fierce struggle against him. Today, all the employees of the factory solemnly and earnestly drew a circle on the name of Ren Baolin, a candidate they loved and also the first worker representative in their factory. At the same time, the employees also voted for Zhuang Yutian, the private deputy factory director who had fought against the rightists and is now working in the workshop. The workers said that as long as someone is truly working for the cause of socialism, we will choose him as a representative.

In the Huoyao Bureau polling station in the Xinjiekou electoral district, voters Deng Yiqing, Wang Yinqing, Zhao Huiqin, and representative candidate Chen Dazhang all wore big red flowers and came to vote together. Chen Dazhang has served as a district people's representative for two consecutive terms. During this rectification movement, voters posted more than 520 big-character posters about him, more than 60 of which criticized the shortcomings in his work. Zhao Huiqin, who had posted a big-character poster criticizing Chen Dazhang for not being careful enough in his work and sometimes having a stiff attitude, said to Chen Dazhang after voting: "Representative Chen, I still voted for you. I believe you can correct your shortcomings and better serve us voters."

Voting at all polling stations in the city began at 6:00 this morning, and the voters' participation was extremely enthusiastic. In the Niujie electoral district, more than 81% of the voters had voted by 10:00 a.m. Voting at all polling stations will stop at 12:00 tonight.

　　认真热烈行使民主权利
　　首都选民投下光荣票
    新华社18日讯　北京城区一百二十多万选民，今天分别到四百个投票站选举了区人民代表。
    北京城区今天是一片节日景象，街道上到处是彩旗和号召选民踊跃投票的巨幅标语。天刚黎明，全城就开始沸腾起来。欢乐的人群敲打着锣鼓，涌往投票站。全国劳动模范、北京市第二建筑工程公司瓦工于春和戴上奖章，赶到东便门选区投票站投了第一票。刚满十八岁的小甜水井南选区选民陈凤媛，为了把这生平的第一票第一个投进票箱，早晨一点多钟就到投票站去等候。住在香炉营四条的六十五岁的选民杨镜如，在1953年和1956年选举中都是投的第一票，今天早晨两点多钟她就赶到投票站，第三次投了第一票。
    中共北京市委第一书记、北京市市长彭真、中央机关和北京市的许多负责人，今天分别在选举站和选民一起投票。
    北京的这届选举贯彻了整风的精神。选民们用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的办法，讨论了选举制度和选举工作，对代表候选人进行了认真的访问和评比。公私合营艺华乐器厂职工们今天特别兴奋地投了票。两年前，这个厂的私方厂长张焕尧骗取了人们的信任，当选了人民代表，去年他的右派面目暴露了，职工们狠狠地向他进行了斗争。今天全厂职工严肃认真地在候选人任宝林的名字上划上圆圈，这是他们所爱戴的伙伴，也是他们工厂中第一位工人代表。同时，职工们也投了曾向右派进行过斗争、现在下到车间干活的私方副厂长庄玉田一票。工人们说，只要是真心为了社会主义事业，我们就挑选他当代表。
    在新街口选区火药局投票站里，选民邓仪卿、王音青、赵惠琴等和代表候选人陈大章都戴着大红花，一起来投票。陈大章已经连任了两届区人民代表，这次整风运动中，选民们给他贴了五百二十多张大字报，其中有六十多张批评了他工作中的缺点。曾经贴大字报批评陈大章工作不细致、态度有时生硬的赵惠琴在投票后对陈大章说：“陈代表，我还是投了你一票。我相信你能改正缺点，更好地为我们选民办事。”
    全市各选举站从今晨六时开始，选民投票的情况极为踊跃，牛街选区到上午十时止，有81％以上的选民投票，各选举站将在当晚十二时停止投票。
