    Jinxian County Establishes First Rural Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital

    (Our dispatch) Jinxian County, Jiangxi, has established its first rural maternity hospital.

    Zhang Gong Maternity Station was originally a model maternity station in the county, with two semi-part-time maternal and child health workers and midwives. In order to further improve maternal and child health work, the station has recently been converted into a rural maternity hospital. The hospital's equipment is simple and crude; what can be borrowed is borrowed, and what needs to be added is appropriately added. The ten communes in the township allocated 150 yuan as start-up funds. It now has three simple beds and one delivery bed.

    进贤县成立第一所农村妇产院
    本报讯　江西进贤县成立了第一所农村产院。
    张公接生站原是该县一个模范接生站，有两个半脱产的妇幼保健员和助产员。为了进一步搞好妇幼卫生工作，这个站最近已改为农村产院。产院的设备因陋就简，能借用的就借用，需要添置的适当添置。由全乡十个社拨款一百五十元为开办费。现已有三张简易病床和一张产床。
