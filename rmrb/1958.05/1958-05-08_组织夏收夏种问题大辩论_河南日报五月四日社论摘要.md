Since the victorious completion of the drought-resistant wheat planting task last autumn, Henan Province's rural areas have launched a vigorous agricultural capital construction and agricultural production campaign centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, and various tasks have achieved great results. Now, more than 80 million mu of summer harvest crops are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Without a major natural disaster, the province's wheat leap forward plan can be fully completed and overfulfilled. Faced with this gratifying scene, everyone is overjoyed, on the one hand continuing to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields, and on the other hand determined to make all preparations with greater vigor to welcome the summer harvest and planting, in order to complete the summer harvest and planting tasks quickly and well.

Doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting is of decisive significance for realizing the province's agricultural leap forward targets this year. From the perspective of summer harvesting, it is a grand review and summary of the various tasks from last winter and this spring. Doing it well can fully demonstrate the achievements of the agricultural production leap forward centered on water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation; it is also the result of the tireless labor of millions of people day and night. Doing it well can reap fruitful results, support national construction, and improve people's lives. More importantly, the people of the whole province will therefore more firmly believe in the socialist construction line of "more, faster, better, and more economical, go all out, aim high", and more firmly believe that they can conquer nature and create miracles with their own hands and wisdom, and realize a great leap forward in agricultural production under the incomparably superior socialist system, thereby boosting their energy and enthusiastically striving for a bumper harvest in the autumn and realizing this year's leap forward plan. From the perspective of summer planting, several high-yield crops that guarantee a bumper agricultural harvest for the whole year, such as sweet potatoes, rice, and corn, are mostly sown in the summer. Timely and good sowing and transplanting lay the foundation for a bumper harvest in the autumn.

Summer harvesting and planting is the busiest and most intense season of the year's production. This year is different from previous years, and its prominent characteristics are: large tasks, high requirements, and tight time. Due to the universal bumper harvest of summer crops, the workload of harvesting has greatly increased compared with previous years. The task of converting 15 million mu to rice cultivation is mostly stubble rice, which requires immediate field preparation, water flooding, and transplanting after wheat harvesting. Sweet potato and corn fields must be universally deeply plowed and sufficient base fertilizer applied. During the summer harvest and planting period, we must also do a good job in the seedling management of cotton and other spring-sown crops, and control pests. Thus, a very sharp contradiction arises, that is, the contradiction between large tasks, high requirements, tight time, and insufficient labor and animal power. Starting early and vigorously solving this problem has become the key to doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting.

Recently, the Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of the CPC put forward ten measures for doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting, and decided to mobilize the whole people to launch a great debate on summer harvesting and planting issues. This approach is timely and necessary. We believe that carrying out a mass great airing of views, great contending, and great debate on summer harvesting and planting issues to eliminate ideological obstacles is a guarantee for the victorious completion of the summer harvesting and planting tasks. We suggest that a province-wide mass great debate on summer harvesting and planting issues be launched rapidly in conjunction with the rectification and commune consolidation work; in communes where the rectification and commune consolidation have ended, some time should also be set aside for a great debate, so as to mobilize the wisdom and strength of millions of people to the summer harvesting and planting, and organize a great leap forward in summer harvesting and planting work.

To carry out a great debate on summer harvesting and planting issues, we must first debate the great significance of doing a good job in summer harvesting and planting. Through investigation, calculation, comparison, and posing questions, we must overcome the paralysis and waiting mentality of some cadres and the masses, raise ideological awareness, and boost our energy. In the process of debate, we advocate bold assumptions, call on everyone to contribute ideas and suggestions, and guide the masses to focus on solving the following problems: First, find all possible ways to create, imitate, and promote various tools for summer harvesting and planting as soon as possible. Second, carry forward the spirit of communism, organize socialist large-scale cooperation, and cooperate with each other between townships and communes to make a common leap forward. Third, rationally allocate labor and animal power, and give full play to the potential of labor and animal power. Fourth, properly arrange various farm work, distinguish priorities and urgency, and establish a production responsibility system. Finally, formulate a summer harvesting and planting plan.

The summer distribution work and the summer harvesting and planting work are closely related and are carried out at the same time. Therefore, when conducting a great debate on summer harvesting and planting, a certain amount of time should be set aside for a great debate on summer distribution issues. During the debate, loudly put forward the slogan of "Fighting hard for three years, expanding public accumulation, expanding reproduction, and storing more reserve grain," to raise the socialist consciousness of the masses and promote the summer harvesting and planting work.

    组织夏收夏种问题大辩论
    河南日报五月四日社论摘要
    自从去年秋季胜利完成抗旱种麦任务以后，河南省农村开展了轰轰烈烈的以兴修水利和积肥为中心的农业基本建设和农业生产运动，各项工作获得了巨大成绩。现在，八千多万亩夏收作物生长良好，丰收在望。如无特大自然灾害，全省小麦跃进计划完全能够完成和超额完成。面对着这种可喜的景象，人人心花怒放，一方面继续加强麦田后期管理，一方面又决心以更大的劲头做好一切准备工作，迎接夏收夏种，以便又快又好地完成夏收夏种任务。
    搞好夏收夏种工作对于实现今年全省农业大跃进指标，具有决定性的意义。从夏收方面来说，它是去冬今春各项工作的大检阅、大总结，搞好了，就可以充分显示以水利建设和积肥为中心的农业生产大跃进的成绩；它又是千百万人民夜以继日辛勤劳动的结果，搞好了就可以获得丰硕的果实，支援国家建设，改善人民的生活。更其重要的是，全省人民将因此更加相信“多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游”的社会主义建设路线，更加相信用自己的双手和智慧可以征服自然，创造奇迹，在无比优越的社会主义制度下，实现农业生产大跃进，从而鼓足干劲，热情蓬勃地争取秋季大丰收，实现今年的跃进规划。从夏种方面来说，保证全年农业大丰收的几种高产作物，如红薯、水稻、玉米等大都在夏季播种，适时而良好地下种和插秧，就为秋季大丰收打下基础。
    夏收夏种是一年生产中最繁忙最紧张的季节，今年又与往年不同，其突出特点是：任务大，要求高，时间紧。由于夏收作物的普遍丰收，收获工作量比往年大为增加。一千五百万亩改种水稻的任务，多为麦茬稻，需要在割麦以后立即进行大田整理、放水泡田和插秧。红薯、玉米地要普遍深耕，施足底肥。在夏收夏种期间，还要作好棉花和其他春播作物的苗期管理，除治虫害。这样，就出现了一个十分尖锐的矛盾，即任务大、要求高、时间紧和劳力畜力不足的矛盾。及早动手大力解决这个问题，已成为搞好夏收夏种的关键所在。
    最近，中共商丘地委提出了搞好夏收夏种的十项措施，决定发动全民展开夏收夏种问题的大辩论，这种做法是适时和必要的。我们认为就夏收夏种问题开展群众性的大鸣大放大辩论，扫除思想障碍，是胜利完成夏收夏种任务的保证。我们建议，在全省范围内结合整风整社工作迅速开展全民性的夏收夏种问题大辩论；在整风整社已经结束的社，也应该拿出一段时间进行大辩论，以便把千百万群众的智慧和力量调动到夏收夏种方面来，组织夏收夏种工作大跃进。
    开展夏收夏种问题大辩论，首先要辩论搞好夏收夏种工作的重大意义，通过查算对比，提出问题，克服部分干部和群众的麻痹等待思想，提高思想自觉，鼓足干劲。在辩论过程中，提倡大胆设想，号召人人献计献策，引导群众着重解决以下问题：第一，想尽各种办法，尽快地创造、仿制和推广夏收夏种的各种工具。第二，发扬共产主义的精神，组织社会主义大协作，乡乡社社互相协作，共同跃进。第三，合理调配劳、畜力，充分发挥劳、畜力的潜在力量。第四，妥善安排各种农活，分清先后缓急，建立生产责任制。最后，制订出夏收夏种计划。
    夏季分配工作和夏收夏种工作有着密切的关系，而且是同时进行的。因此，在进行夏收夏种大辩论的时候，应该抽出一定的时间进行夏季分配问题的大辩论。辩论中响亮提出“苦战三年，扩大公共积累，扩大再生产，多搞储备粮”的口号，提高群众的社会主义觉悟，推动夏收夏种工作。
