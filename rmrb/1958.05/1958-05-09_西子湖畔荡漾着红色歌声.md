    In the sunny city of Hangzhou, socialist songs are flying everywhere. Recently, 120,000 people have participated in regular singing activities. The general public has learned three songs: "Bring out revolutionary vigor," "Great Leap Forward in Production," and "Catch up with England."
    Workers at the Hangzhou Cotton Textile Factory, Zhejiang Flax Textile Factory, and Zhejiang Printing and Dyeing Factory have created more than ten songs such as "Catching up with the No. 15 State-owned Cotton Factory in One Year," "Learning from Yu Fengying," and "Spinning Superior Yarn." All universities and middle schools in the city have established choirs, and every class has established singing teams (groups). Singing teams have also been organized among urban residents, and new phenomena such as couples singing together and fathers teaching their children to sing have emerged in the teams.
    In the Jianqiao District of suburban Hangzhou, 20,000 farmers have already joined singing teams, and most have learned two or three songs. (Xinhua News Agency)

    西子湖畔荡漾着红色歌声
　　在春光明媚的杭州市，社会主义歌声到处飞扬，近日来有十二万人参加了经常性的歌咏活动。一般群众都已学会了“拿出革命干劲来”、“生产大跃进”、“赶上英国”等三个歌曲。
    杭州棉纺厂、浙江麻纺织厂、浙江印染厂等工厂工人，创作了“一年赶上国棉十五厂”、“学习俞凤英”、“纺织优级纱”等十多个歌曲。全市大中学校都建立了合唱团，班班都建立了歌咏队（组）。城市居民中也组织了歌咏队，队里还出现夫妻同唱、父教子学的新气象。
    杭州市郊笕桥区已经有二万农民参加歌咏队，一般都已经学会两三只歌。　（新华社）
