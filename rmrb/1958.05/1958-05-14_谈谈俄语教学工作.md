　　On Russian Language Teaching

　　I study Russian, and the phenomenon of "valuing the old and belittling the new" is also seriously present in Russian language teaching. For example, in the first semester of the fourth year of the teacher training and translation program at the Beijing Russian Language Institute, among the eight texts selected, except for "Russian Character" and "More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," which are modern works, most of the texts are translated from the works of 18th and 19th-century Russian writers. After studying these materials, students have a certain improvement in their Russian language knowledge and have enriched their vocabulary in literature. However, the content of these materials is mostly far removed from our country's real life and detached from current social production and class struggle. Many students can recite Pushkin's biography and his masterpiece "Eugene Onegin" by heart, but many people do not know how to translate "the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement" and "the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme" into Russian, and many people find it quite difficult to read "News Briefs." Fourth-year students generally feel that their oral ability is poor, and writing an essay is also quite difficult. Now, although the unhealthy trend of "valuing the old and belittling the new" has been initially reversed, it is still not enough, and some teachers are still not very clear in their thinking. Individual teachers still complain that the teaching materials are changed too frequently, making it difficult to accumulate teaching experience and improve teaching quality. It is said that most of the foreign language teaching materials in Soviet universities are selected from good articles in newspapers and periodicals, which are closely integrated with real life, and the teaching effect is also very good. I think we should learn from the Soviet Union in this regard.

　　谈谈俄语教学工作
    我是学俄语的，“厚古薄今”的现象在俄语教学中也严重地存在着。如北京俄语学院师范翻译四年级上学期所选的教材中有八篇课文，其中除了“俄罗斯性格”和“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”两篇是近代作品外，大部分课文都译自十八和十九世纪俄罗斯作家的作品。同学们学完了这些教材后，对俄语知识有一定的提高，丰富了文学方面的词汇。但是，这些教材的内容大多是和我国现实生活有很大距离，脱离了当前的社会生产和阶级斗争。许多同学能把普希金的传记和他的杰作“欧根奥?金”背的烂熟，可是不少人不知道“反浪费反保守运动”和“汉语拼音方案”这两个词译成俄文该怎么讲，不少人读起“新闻简报”来感到相当吃力。四年级同学普遍感到口语能力差，写一篇作文也相当困难。现在，虽然初步扭转了“厚古薄今”的歪风，但是做的还很不够，有的教师思想上还不很通，个别教师还埋怨教材更换频繁，难于积累教学经验和提高教学质量等。据说苏联大学里的外语教材大部分选自报刊上好的文章，和现实生活结合得相当密切，教学效果也很好。我想我们在这方面应该向苏联学习。
