Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 13th: Since May 1st, Jiangxi Province has experienced continuous heavy rainfall, causing rapid rises in river water levels. Some rivers have already exceeded warning levels, and some areas have suffered from flash floods and waterlogging. According to weather forecasts, river water levels will continue to rise, and the Gan River, the province's largest river, is expected to experience a significant flood between the 15th and 20th.

Currently, the people of all counties along the rivers and lakes have been urgently mobilized, with Party secretaries taking command, and large numbers of cadres and farmers have been drawn together to form flood prevention and rescue teams to raise, reinforce, and strengthen the defense of the embankments at dangerous sections. In areas where waterlogging has occurred due to heavy rains, farmers are also being organized to dredge ditches for drainage and to support and wash seedlings. The counties of Nanchang Prefecture have put forward the battle cry of "Rescuing is like fighting fire, protecting seedlings is like saving lives, conquering floods, and ensuring a bumper harvest." Li Guonian, the Secretary of the Fengcheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in this prefecture, has led more than 4,000 cadres and farmers day and night since the 8th, holding fast to the riverbanks. Another group of cadres led 80,000 people in a hard-fought battle for four days and four nights, rescuing more than 70,000 mu of flooded rice seedlings. Eleven counties in Shangrao Prefecture, including Boyang and Guangfeng, have organized more than 140,000 people to participate in flood prevention, rescue, and seedling support work.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 13th: Anhui Province is making early preparations for flood prevention. All counties have successively established and improved flood prevention organizational leadership structures. Many places are mobilizing the masses to raise flood prevention materials, and the main flood prevention materials and equipment supplied by the province to various regions have been planned and arranged.

In order to strengthen the leadership of flood prevention preparation work, the Anhui Provincial Party Committee instructed leaders at all levels to start with inspections. The provincial Party Committee's Yangtze River Embankment Flood Prevention Inspection Team conducted a comprehensive inspection of the embankment sections in thirteen counties along the river from April 12 to May 4.

Xinhua News Agency, 13th: The Flood Prevention Inspection Team of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, formed in mid-April to ensure the victory of this year's flood prevention work, concluded its inspection of the Yellow River's pre-flood season preparations on the 8th.

Over the past twenty days, members of the inspection team have traveled along the Yellow River's thousand-mile-long embankment, inspecting the pre-flood season preparation work of important embankment sections in Henan and Shandong provinces in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. They inspected the main dangerous works, dangerous sections, flood overflow projects, beach protection projects, and the embankment sluice and culvert projects that have been built and are under construction along the embankment.

After on-site inspections and discussions, the inspection team believes that: under the unified leadership of the local Party and government leading organs, it is necessary to do a good job in ideological mobilization so that flood prevention work becomes the conscious demand of the masses along the river. At the same time, flood prevention work should be closely integrated with production, and comprehensive and detailed flood prevention and embankment management work should be carried out layer by layer from the bottom up by the masses.

　　江西连降暴雨群众日夜抢险
    黄河下游进行汛前准备工作
    据新华社南昌13日电　5月1日以来，江西省连降暴雨，各河水位急剧上涨，有些河流已先后超过警戒水位，部分地区发生了山洪和内涝灾害。据气象预报，各河水位将继续上涨，纵贯全省的最大河流赣江将在15日到20日间出现较大洪水。
    现在，沿河滨湖各县人民都已紧急动员起来，由党委书记担任指挥，抽调大批干部和农民共同组成防汛抢险队伍，对圩堤险段进行加高、加固和加强防守工作。因暴雨发生内涝的地区，也正组织农民开沟排水，扶苗洗苗。南昌专区各县提出了“抢险如救火、保苗如保命、战胜洪水、保证丰收”的战斗口号。这个专区丰城县中共县委书记李国年从8日起率领机关干部和农民四千多人，日夜坚守在河堤上；另一批干部带领的八万群众苦战四天四夜，已抢救了七万多亩被淹的禾苗。上饶专区波阳、广丰等十一个县已经组织十四万多人投入防洪抢险和扶苗工作。
    据新华社合肥13日电　安徽省提早进行防汛准备工作。各县都先后建立和健全了防汛组织领导机构。很多地方正在发动群众筹集防汛物资，由省供应给各地的主要防汛物资、器材已编好计划并进行了安排。
    为了加强防汛准备工作的领导，中共安徽省委指示各级领导从检查入手。省委组成的长江堤防汛前检查组，从4月12日到5月4日，先后在沿江十三个县的堤段上逐段进行了全面检查。
    据新华社13日讯　水利电力部、黄河水利委员会为了确保今年防汛工作的胜利，4月中旬组成的黄河防汛检查团已经在8日结束对黄河汛前准备工作的检查。
    二十多天来，检查团成员奔走在千里黄河大堤上，检查了黄河下游河南、山东境内各重要堤段的汛前准备工作。检查了沿堤主要险工、险段，溢洪工程、护滩工程，以及已建和正在兴修的沿堤闸涵工程。
    经过现场检查和座谈，检查团认为：必须在各地党政领导机关统一领导下，做好思想发动工作，使防汛工作成为沿河群众自觉的要求。同时要使防汛工作与生产密切结合，并通过群众自下而上层层进行全面细致的防汛和堤防管养工作。
