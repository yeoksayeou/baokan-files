    Painting a Cake
    U.S. Secretary of Commerce Sinclair Weeks recently declared at a gathering: although "signs of recession are all around," "the long-term development prospects of science, technology, and industry show astonishing wonders in the next ten years, which should inspire confidence."
    Since the outbreak of the economic crisis in the United States, the Washington authorities have more than once declared that the economic situation will improve in a few weeks or months. However, contrary to expectations, the crisis has not stopped, and production continues to decline. The U.S. rulers are already panic-stricken. Therefore, Weeks issued this check for "wonders" to appear in the next ten years.
    However, what people pay attention to is the facts, first and foremost the facts of today. Weeks' check is nothing more than a self-deceiving painted cake.

    画饼
    美国商业部长辛克莱·威克斯最近在一次集会上宣称：尽管现在“四周到处都是衰退的迹象”，但是，“科学、技术和工业长期发展的景象，显示出今后十年中令人吃惊的奇境，这种奇境应该鼓舞人的信心”。
    美国爆发经济危机以后，华盛顿当局曾经不止一次地扬言再过几个星期或是几个月，经济情况将有好转。可是，事与愿违，危机并未止步，生产仍然继续下跌。美国统治者的心里已经慌恐不安了。于是，威克斯就开出了这张今后十年出现“奇境”的支票。
    但是，人们注意的毕竟是事实，首先就是今天的事实，威克斯的支票，不过是一个自欺欺人的画饼而已。
