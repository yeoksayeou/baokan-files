Our Newspaper Reports: This reporter Liu Dachang reports: The drought situation in Hebei Province is currently severe. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) convened an emergency drought resistance meeting in Beijing on May 7th and 8th, attended by secretaries of local committees. The meeting decided to continue to boost morale, turn bad things into good, and launch an even higher drought resistance movement, riding the waves and diverting water during the drought. With the spirit of "commanding from a height, like a landslide," they will overcome the drought, expand the area of irrigated land to 100 million mu, basically achieve water conservancy, and ensure a bumper harvest even without rain.

Comrade Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, made it clear at the beginning of the meeting: This is a question of who overwhelms whom. Will the drought overwhelm us? Or will we overwhelm the drought? He then analyzed the current drought situation in the province, saying: "Our province has not had thorough rain for more than two hundred and seventy days. The rainfall on April 23rd was the largest, but it only barely moistened the topsoil in more than fifty counties. About one hundred counties have not had rain or have had very little rain. In this situation, we launched a drought-resistant sowing campaign and achieved unprecedented results. A total of more than 84 million mu of spring land has been planted with more than 54 million mu, completing 64% of the total task. The planting was timely, with sufficient fertilizer, improved varieties, and high quality. However, there are still more than 30 million mu that have not been planted, and most of them are key crops for achieving the annual target of 25 billion jin of grain - sweet potatoes, rice, and other high-yield crops, as well as oil crops. Due to the lack of rain, the drought continues to develop, and seedlings are constantly dying from drought. The task of checking and replanting seedlings is very heavy. It is necessary to take further emergency measures to overcome the drought."

Comrade Yan Dakai said: There are also two paths, two approaches, and two results in the struggle against drought: One is to retreat in the face of difficulties, admit defeat, resulting in barren land for miles, disaster looming, the Great Leap Forward failing, and the masses suffering. The other path is to continue to boost morale, strive for the best, and launch a higher drought resistance movement, resulting in turning bad things into good, diverting water during the drought, achieving water conservancy, overcoming the drought, realizing the Great Leap Forward plan, and ensuring a bumper harvest. Now is a critical moment, and we must not sit idly by and watch disaster strike, but must strive for the best. We must not harbor wishful thinking, as wishful thinking will lead to sin. According to 580 years of data, there have been 137 instances of severe and major droughts. This year's drought is the worst since 1928. If we do not overcome the drought, it will bring greater losses than floods. The only way is to boost our morale, turn bad things into good, rely on the people's power to reverse the heavens, achieve water conservancy, and overcome the drought.

Yan Dakai analyzed the favorable conditions for overcoming the drought, saying: We have full confidence and strength. First, the masses support large-scale water conservancy projects. It is necessary to organize mass debates on whether to wait for disaster to strike or to engage in large-scale water conservancy to overcome the drought. We must believe that the masses have the power to reverse the heavens. Second, we already have various experiences in water conservancy and a foundation for the previous stage of drought-resistant sowing. Third, the broad masses of farmers are greatly increasing their communist spirit during the movement. If one commune has difficulties, the whole township supports it; if one township has difficulties, the whole county supports it; if one county or one special district has difficulties, the entire special district or the entire province supports it. This spirit has been universally established throughout the province and has taken root in the broad masses. Fourth, it is much better to engage in water conservancy now than in the cold winter.

Will further large-scale water conservancy projects lead to labor and material shortages? Comrade Yan Dakai pointed out: It will be a bit tight. However, if we do not lead the masses to overcome the drought, we may face barren land for miles, which will be even tighter. Being a little tight now can lead to a bumper harvest, which is much better than the tension of creating a disaster. As long as we explain it clearly to the masses, they will be happy to be a little tight now.

Based on the spirit of Comrade Yan Dakai's speech, the meeting conducted intense and serious discussions. Everyone was full of confidence and enthusiasm. Linking the specific conditions of their regions, they summarized the various successful experiences and mass innovations of the previous water conservancy movement and the struggle against drought, and proposed the general slogan: If the sky does not rain, we will do everything possible to get water from the ground; we will work even if it rains, and we will work even if it does not rain. There are three methods: First, drill machine wells and deep cone wells, sinking all wells and pits to dozens of zhang; Second, dig large wells. Each large well can irrigate 300 to 500 mu of land, and if the province digs 80,000 to 100,000 wells, it can irrigate 30 to 50 million mu; Third, continue to tap springs. According to calculations based on local conditions, Hebei Province has completed more than 70 million mu of irrigated land since last winter and this spring. Although a small portion has not yet produced benefits due to drought, if we go through this movement again, completing 100 million mu will definitely achieve basic water conservancy throughout the province.

The meeting also proposed: It is necessary to continue to promote the communist spirit. Handan, Xingtai, Shijiazhuang, Baoding, and other regions in the western foothills of the Taihang Mountains, where groundwater is abundant, should vigorously find water and dig springs to support Tianjin and Cangzhou. Tianjin and Cangxian special districts should provide manpower to support the west in digging springs and building reservoirs, with mutual support and cooperation. The project to fundamentally control the rivers of the Hai River system should also be accelerated in conjunction with the drought resistance movement.

Regarding continuing to complete drought-resistant sowing and strengthening wheat field management, various places are actively carrying out these tasks. Each county in Baoding special district proposed irrigating wheat five times and managing five high tides, and is now conducting the fourth time, and has also taken many measures to prevent wheat lodging. Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other special districts are using various methods to ensure full cotton seedling emergence. Each county in Xingtai special district has also universally launched a weeding and pest control campaign.

At the end of the meeting, Comrade Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the CCP, called on cadres and masses throughout the province to emancipate their minds, break superstitions, think boldly, and create boldly. He listed many examples of creations and inventions among the masses, illustrating the infinite wisdom of the masses. He also required all localities to conduct a universal and comprehensive inspection of the current drought-resistant sowing and water conservancy movement, and to immediately seize and solve any problems discovered in a timely manner.

### 三十年未有的大旱，近三百天未下透雨，吓不退四千万英雄！  河北人民正以回天之力压倒干旱  共产主义风尚普遍树立，一社有困难全乡支援，一乡有困难全县支援

    三十年未有的大旱，近三百天未下透雨，吓不退四千万英雄！
    河北人民正以回天之力压倒干旱
    共产主义风尚普遍树立，一社有困难全乡支援，一乡有困难全县支援
    本报讯　记者刘大昌报道：河北省目前干旱现象严重，中共河北省委于5月7、8两日在北京召集各地委书记举行紧急抗旱会议，决定继续鼓起干劲，变坏事为好事，掀起一个更高的抗旱运动，乘风破浪，乘旱引水，以“高屋建瓴、势如破竹”的气概，战胜干旱，水浇地扩大到一亿亩，基本实现水利化，不下雨也要保证丰收。
    中共河北省委书记处书记阎达开同志在会议开始就明确指出：这是谁压倒谁的问题。是干旱压倒我们？还是我们压倒干旱？接着他分析目前全省干旱情况说：“我们省至今已二百七十多天没有透雨了，4月23日一场雨是最大的，但也只是五十多个县的耕地勉强接上墒土，还有一百个左右的县未下或下雨很小。在这种情况下，我们开展了抗旱播种运动，取得了空前的成绩。全省共八千四百多万亩春白地已种上五千四百多万亩，完成了总任务的64％，而且种得适时、肥料充足、优种化、质量高。但是还有三千多万亩没有种上，并且多是实现全年二百五十亿斤粮食的关键性作物——甘薯、水稻等高产作物和油料作物。已种上的因不下雨，旱情继续发展，幼苗不断被旱死，查苗补苗任务很大。必须进一步采取紧急措施战胜干旱。
    阎达开同志说：向干旱作斗争也有两条道路，两种做法，两种结果：一是畏难而退，甘拜下风，结果是赤地千里，灾难临头，跃进落空，群众遭殃。另一条道路是继续鼓起干劲，力争上游，掀起更高的抗旱运动，结果是变坏事为好事，乘旱引水，实现水利化，压倒干旱，跃进计划实现，保证丰收。现在是一个紧要关头，决不能坐视灾难临头，必须力争上游。不能存侥幸心理，侥幸就要造成罪恶。根据五百八十多年的材料，特大旱、大旱共有一百三十七次，今年的旱情是从1928年以来所没有的大旱。如果不战胜旱灾，它将比水灾带来更大的损失。唯一的办法，就是鼓足干劲，把坏事变成好事，依靠群众回天之力，实现水利化，压倒干旱。
    阎达开分析战胜干旱的有利条件说：我们有充分的信心和力量。第一、发动群众大搞水利，群众是拥护的。要组织群众大辩论，是坐等灾难临头还是大搞水利化压倒干旱。要相信群众有回天之力。第二、已有了搞水利的各种经验和前一段抗旱播种胜利的基础。第三、广大农民群众在运动中大量增长着共产主义精神，一社有困难全乡支援，一乡有困难全县支援，一县、一专区有困难全专区、全省支援。这种风尚已在全省普遍树立，在广大群众中生了根。第四、现在搞水利比寒冷的冬天强的多。
    再大搞水利化是不是会发生劳力、物料紧张等问题呢？阎达开同志指出：是要紧张一些的。但是，如不领导群众压倒干旱，就可能来个赤地千里，到那时则更紧张。现在紧张一点，可以取得丰收，比造成灾难的紧张滋味好的多。只要向群众讲清楚，群众是会乐于现在紧张一些的。
    会议根据阎达开同志所谈的精神，进行了紧张而又认真的讨论，大家信心和干劲十足，联系本地区具体情况总结了前一段水利运动和抗旱斗争的各种成功经验和群众创造，提出总的口号是：天不下雨，千方百计向地下要水，下雨也干，不下雨也干。办法有三条：一是打机井，深锥井，把一切井一切坑塘深锥几十丈；二是挖大井。每个大井能浇地三、五百亩，全省挖八万、十万个，就可浇地三、五千万亩；三是继续凿泉。根据各地情况计算，河北省去冬今春已完成水浇地七千多万亩，虽然由于干旱有小部分尚未发生效益，如果再经过这次运动，完成一亿亩，基本上实现全省水利化是肯定能作到的。
    会议上还提出：要继续发扬共产主义精神，西部沿太行山麓地下水源充足的邯郸、邢台、石家庄、保定等地区大力找水挖泉支援津、沧；天津、沧县专区则出人力支援西部挖泉、修水库，互相大支援大协作。根治海河系各河的工程，也要结合抗旱运动加速进行。
    关于继续完成抗旱播种和加强麦田管理，各地正在积极进行，保定专区各县提出小麦浇五水，管理五个高潮，现正进行第四次，并对小麦倒伏也作了许多进行防止的措施。邯郸、石家庄等专区，正用各种办法保证棉花全苗，邢台专区各县还普遍开展了除草灭虫运动。
    会议最后，中共河北省委书记处书记阎达开同志号召全省干部和群众放开思想、打破迷信，大胆的想、大胆的创造，他列举了许多群众中创造和发明的实例，说明群众的智慧无穷。并且要求各地对当前抗旱播种、水利运动情况进行普遍地大检查，对发现的各种问题立即抓住及时解决。（附图片）
