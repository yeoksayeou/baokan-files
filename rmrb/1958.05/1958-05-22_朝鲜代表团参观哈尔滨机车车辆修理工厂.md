Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 21st: The Korean People's Delegation to China, led by delegation head Xu Zhenshook and deputy head Kim Chun-hae, visited the Harbin Rolling Stock Repair Factory at 10:00 AM today. This factory was established sixty years ago, coinciding with the birth of the city of Harbin. They visited the eighty-two Korean war orphans who are studying production technology there.

Factory Director Shang Cheng, who was awarded the Korean Third Class National Flag Medal for his contribution to helping Korean war orphans with their production internships, told the distinguished guests that the technical level of these eighty-two Korean war orphans has improved rapidly, and many of them can do the work of fourth and fifth-grade workers. In the locomotive workshop, the distinguished guests saw many Korean war orphans wearing work clothes and working hard. Delegation head Xu Zhenshook asked Korean orphan Wu Bingmo whether he could operate independently after returning to his country. Wu Bingmo replied, "Yes!" Xu Zhenshook congratulated him repeatedly and urged him to learn from the Chinese master workers. Wu Bingmo's parents were both members of the Korean Workers' Party and were collectively shot by the US imperialists during the Korean War. He is sixteen years old this year. When he first came to China, he was only a ten-year-old child, and now he can do the work of a fourth or fifth-grade technician.

In the afternoon, the distinguished guests visited the Harbin Institute of Technology and were warmly welcomed by the teachers and students of the school.

In the evening, Yu Tianfang, Vice Governor of Heilongjiang Province, hosted a banquet to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China.
