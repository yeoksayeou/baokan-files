Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade sent telegrams to three Japanese organizations on May 9th, severely protesting the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan for condoning thugs tearing down the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki. The telegrams pointed out, "This is a severe insult to the Chinese people, which the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate, and we express our utmost indignation at this."

The three Japanese organizations are: the Japanese Parliamentarians' League for the Promotion of Japan-China Trade, the Japan International Trade Promotion Association, and the Japan Importers and Exporters Association.

The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade said in the telegrams that the Nagasaki incident, which occurred after the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, was not accidental. The Japanese government has repeatedly declared that Chinese commercial representative offices have no right to fly their national flag. We have long pointed out that this practice by the Japanese government is not only an attempt to fundamentally overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and its inseparable memorandum, but also openly condones the act of insulting our national flag. The Nagasaki flag incident is the best proof of this. What is particularly infuriating is that in this flag incident, the Kishida Nobusuke government openly condoned and shielded the thugs who insulted our national flag, instructed the Nagasaki local authorities in advance to remove the Chinese national flag hanging at the stamp and paper-cut exhibition held there, and immediately released the criminals who insulted our national flag after the incident occurred. This shows that the Japanese government's attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people has reached an intolerable level.

The telegrams said: The Nagasaki flag incident once again powerfully exposed that the Kishida Nobusuke government's so-called "expansion of Sino-Japanese trade" is merely to deceive the Japanese people, while in reality it is willing to be hostile to the Chinese people, undermine Sino-Japanese trade, and adhere to an unfriendly policy towards China.

The telegrams pointed out: The Japanese national flags displayed at the Japanese commodity exhibitions in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan in our country have been protected by the Chinese people and government. In contrast, the Japanese government condoned thugs tearing down the Chinese national flag displayed at the Nagasaki stamp and paper-cut exhibition. This act of repaying kindness with enmity and openly provoking by the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan has aroused great indignation among the Chinese people. This act of hostility towards the Chinese people by the Japanese government has undermined the conditions for equal and mutually beneficial trade between the two countries, and therefore cannot but seriously affect Sino-Japanese trade. The Kishida Nobusuke government should bear serious responsibility for this incident and must bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: China National Metals & Minerals Import & Export Corporation has recalled their delegation to Japan, which was negotiating with Yawata Iron & Steel Co. regarding the import of 158,000 tons of steel to the factory.

The two companies cabled their delegation in Japan on May 8th, saying that the people across the country were extremely indignant at the Kishida Nobusuke government's series of hostile actions, following the undermining of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, of condoning thugs to insult the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki. Under such circumstances, the conditions for trade between the peoples of China and Japan on an equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly basis have been completely destroyed by the Kishida Nobusuke government. The cable stated that the government had been notified: "At the request of the Chinese people, the Chinese government has stopped issuing import and export licenses to Japan." Therefore, the cable requested the delegation to immediately stop the negotiations and return home.

Xinhua News Agency, May 10th: Li Zhuozhi, the head of the China National Metals & Minerals Import & Export Corporation's delegation to Japan, held a press conference in Tokyo today to deliver a statement on the negotiation of the Sino-Japanese steel barter contract. The full text is as follows:

After the Kishida Nobusuke government of Japan undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, it condoned thugs to insult our national flag in Nagasaki. Our people are extremely indignant at this series of deliberate actions to antagonize the Chinese people. Under such circumstances, the conditions for trade between the peoples of China and Japan on an equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly basis have been completely destroyed by the Kishida Nobusuke government. At the request of the people, our government has stopped issuing import and export licenses to Japan. Therefore, we have decided to stop the steel barter negotiations that are being conducted here.

Regarding this steel barter negotiation, our delegation came to Tokyo with great sincerity to implement the long-term barter agreement and the 1958 barter protocol signed with the Japanese steel delegation in Beijing on February 26 this year. It has been more than forty days, and the delegations of both sides have done a lot of work. However, the Japanese government has obstructed it in many ways, especially on the issue of purchasing Chinese rice, deliberately putting forward some unreasonable attached conditions to delay and undermine the negotiation of this steel barter contract.

The above series of facts show that the Kishida Nobusuke government, disregarding the friendly wishes between the Chinese and Japanese people, has completely destroyed the conditions for trade between the two peoples on an equal, mutually beneficial, and friendly basis, causing Sino-Japanese trade and the negotiation of this steel barter contract to come to a standstill. We firmly believe that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people cannot be destroyed. No matter what obstacles and sabotage our two peoples' friendship encounters, it will eventually overcome all obstacles and continue to develop forward.

    我国际贸易促进会致电日本三团体
　　严重抗议岸信介侮辱我国人民
    在我国人民要求下，我政府停止签发对日进出口许可证
    中日钢铁易货谈判停止，我代表团即将回国
    新华社10日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会在5月9日分别打电报给日本三团体，严重抗议日本岸信介政府在长崎纵容歹徒扯下我国国旗的事件。电报指出，“这是对中国人民严重的侮辱，中国人民绝不能容忍，对此表示十分愤慨”。
    日本的三团体是：日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟、日本国际贸易促进协会和日本输出入组合。
    中国国际贸易促进委员会在电报中说，在日本岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定之后又发生长崎事件不是偶然的。日本政府早就一再宣称中国商务代表机构无权悬挂本国国旗。我们早已指出，日本政府这种作法，不仅是企图从根本上推翻第四次中日贸易协定和其不可分割的备忘录，而且是公开纵容污辱我国国旗的行为。长崎国旗事件，就是一个最好的证明。特别令人愤慨的是，在这次国旗事件中，岸信介政府公然纵容和包庇污辱我国国旗的歹徒，事前指令长崎地方当局摘下在该地举行的邮票、剪纸展览会上悬挂的我国国旗，事件发生后又立即释放了污辱我国国旗的犯罪分子。这就表明，日本政府敌视中国人民的态度已经达到了令人难以容忍的地步。
    电报说：长崎国旗事件，又一次有力地揭露了岸信介政府所谓“扩大中日贸易”只不过是为了欺骗日本人民，而实际上却是不惜敌视中国人民，破坏中日贸易，坚持对中国的不友好政策。
    电报指出：日本商品展览会在我国北京、上海、广州和武汉所悬挂的日本国旗，受到了我国人民和政府的保护。与此相反，日本政府却纵容暴徒扯下了在长崎邮票、剪纸展览会上悬挂的我国国旗，日本岸信介政府这种以怨报德、公然挑衅的行为，引起了我国人民的极大愤慨。日本政府这种敌视中国人民的行为，已经使两国间进行平等互利贸易的条件遭到破坏，因而不能不严重地影响到中日贸易。岸信介政府对此次事件应负严重责任，并且必须承担由此而引起的一切后果。
    新华社10日讯　中国五金进口公司和中国矿产公司，已经召回他们正在日本同八幡钢铁厂谈判关于向该厂进口十五万八千吨钢的访日代表团。
    这两个公司在5月8日电告他们在日本的代表团说：全国人民对岸信介政府继破坏第四次中日贸易协定之后，又纵容暴徒在长崎污辱中国国旗这一连串的敌意行动万分愤慨。在这种情况下中日两国人民间在平等互利和友好基础上进行贸易的条件已被岸信介政府彻底破坏。电文说，已接政府通知：“在中国人民的要求下，中国政府已停止签发对日进出口许可证。”因此电文要代表团立即停止谈判回国。
    新华社10日讯　中国五金进口公司和中国矿产公司的访日代表团团长李琢之今天在东京举行记者招待会，就签订中日钢铁易货合同的谈判问题发表谈话，全文如下：
    日本岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定之后，又纵容暴徒在长崎污辱我国国旗。对于这一连串蓄意与中国人民为敌的行动，我国人民愤慨万分。在这种情况下，中日两国人民间在平等互利和友好基础上进行贸易的条件已被岸信介政府彻底破坏了。我国政府在人民要求下，已经停止签发对日进出口许可证。因此，我们在此间进行的钢铁易货谈判即决定停止。
    关于这次钢铁易货谈判，我们代表团根据今年2月26日在北京与日本钢铁代表团所签订的长期易货协议和1958年易货议定书，带着十分的诚意，为实现这个协议，来东京进行谈判，至今已有四十余天，双方代表团之间进行了不少工作。但是日本政府多方进行阻挠，特别是对购买中国大米的问题，故意提出若干不合理的附带条件，以拖延和破坏这次钢铁易货合同的谈判。
    上述一系列事实，说明岸信介政府不顾中日两国人民之间的友好意愿，彻底破坏了中日两国人民在平等互利和友好的基础上进行贸易的条件，使中日贸易及这次签订钢铁易货合同的谈判陷于停顿。我们深信，中日两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的。我们两国人民的友谊不管遭到怎样的阻挠和破坏，终将排除一切障碍不断地向前发展。
