    Make Full Use of Cotton Stalk Peel and Flax
    These two kinds of fibers have a national annual output of more than 12 million dan, if all of them are utilized, 600 million people can increase more than ten chi of cloth per person.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanba, 3rd. The National Flax Fiber Production Technology Exchange Symposium was recently held in Shanba Town, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is rich in flax production. The reporter learned from this meeting that the Second Ministry of Commerce and the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives have decided to purchase 1,145,000 dan of cotton stalk peel fiber and 300,000 dan of flax fiber nationwide from September 1957 to August 1958.
    According to preliminary statistics, the national annual output of cotton stalk peel fiber is more than 9 million dan, and flax fiber is 3 million dan. The sum of the two is equal to the total output of other hemp in the country. If all of them are used for weaving, 70 million bolts can be woven, which is equivalent to an average increase of more than ten chi of cloth per person per year for the 600 million people in the country; at the same time, it can also increase farmers' income by more than 300 million yuan. However, in the past, these two kinds of fibers were not fully utilized, and farmers used them as firewood or pig feed.
    Cotton stalk peel can be made into rayon and woven into blanket cloth, printed cloth, canvas, mosquito nets, socks, sacks, etc. Now Sichuan, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, and Guizhou have all built many new rayon processing plants, preparing for mass production. Flax is "linen," which is a valuable textile raw material in the international market, and its quality is better than cotton and general hemp. In the past one or two years, textile factories in Tianjin, Wuxi and other places have begun to use flax fiber to make canvas and cotton-linen blended printed cloth, which is very popular among consumers.
    This symposium determined that the future management policy for flax fiber is: to strengthen production technology guidance, purchase and sell in large quantities, operate for a long time, and actively promote utilization. Representatives from various regions attending the meeting exchanged experiences in flax fiber peeling and processing, and conducted in-depth research on technical guidance for agricultural production and other issues.

    充分利用棉秆皮和胡麻
    这两种纤维，全国年产一千二百多万担，如果全部利用起来，六亿人每人可增加十尺多布。
    据新华社陕坝3日电　全国胡麻纤维生产技术交流座谈会最近在盛产胡麻的内蒙古自治区陕坝镇举行。记者从这个会上获悉：第二商业部和全国供销合作总社确定从1957年9月到1958年8月在全国收购棉秆皮纤维一一四点五万担，胡麻纤维三十万担。
    据初步统计，全国每年可产棉秆皮纤维九百多万担，胡麻纤维三百万担，两项合计，等于全国其他麻类的总产量。如果全部用来织布，可以织七千万匹，等于全国六亿人口每人每年平均增加十尺多布；同时还可以给农民增加三亿多元的收入。但是过去这两种纤维因为没有被充分利用，农民拿来当柴烧或作猪饲料。
    棉秆皮可以制成人造棉，织成毯子布、花布、帆布、蚊帐、袜子、麻袋等。现在四川、河南、河北、山东、贵州都新建了许多人造棉加工厂，准备大量生产。胡麻就是“亚麻”，在国际市场是一种价值很高的纺织原料，质量比棉花和一般麻类都好。近一两年来，天津、无锡等地纺织厂开始用胡麻纤维制成帆布及棉麻混纺花布，很受消费者欢迎。
    这次座谈会确定，今后对胡麻纤维的经营方针是：加强生产技术指导，大收大买，长期经营，积极推广利用。到会的各地代表交流了胡麻纤维剥制加工的经验，并对农业生产的技术指导等问题作了深入研究。
