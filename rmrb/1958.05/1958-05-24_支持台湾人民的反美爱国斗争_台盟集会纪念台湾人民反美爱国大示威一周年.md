Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: To commemorate the first anniversary of the Taiwanese people's "May 24th" patriotic anti-American demonstration, the headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League convened a forum this afternoon in Beijing for its members and Taiwanese compatriots. The Taiwanese compatriots present unanimously and angrily condemned the towering crimes of the American troops invading Taiwan, and expressed their full support and sympathy for the Taiwanese people's patriotic anti-American struggle.

The forum was presided over by Li Chunqing, Vice Chairman of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League. After outlining the situation of the Taiwanese people's anti-American patriotic demonstration on May 24th, Li Chunqing said: The anti-American demonstration inherited the patriotic tradition of the Taiwanese people and demonstrated the indomitable spirit of the Taiwanese people. Recently, the United States has instigated the military and secret service personnel of the Chiang Kai-shek clique to directly participate in the military and subversive activities of the Indonesian insurgents. Therefore, it has aroused even greater indignation among the Taiwanese people against the American aggressors.

Li Chunqing concluded: Anti-American demonstrations of the same nature as the Taiwanese people's "May 24th" anti-American demonstration are constantly occurring all over the world. Now the American aggressors are in a situation like rats running across the street that everyone shouts to beat. We believe that the Taiwanese people will never succumb to American oppression.

Xie Nanguang, Yang Chunsong, Chen Wenbin, Wang Wande, Su Ziheng and others also spoke at the meeting, expressing their concern for the Taiwanese compatriots who are still under the oppression of American imperialism today.

    支持台湾人民的反美爱国斗争
    台盟集会纪念台湾人民反美爱国大示威一周年
    据新华社23日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部为纪念台湾人民“五·二四”爱国反美大示威一周年，今天下午召集在北京的盟员和台湾同胞举行座谈会。到会台湾同胞一致愤怒地谴责侵台美军的滔天罪行，并且表示全力支持和同情台湾人民的反美爱国斗争。
    座谈会是由台湾民主自治同盟副主席李纯青主持的。李纯青概述了台湾人民反美爱国大示威的情况后说：反美大示威继承了台湾人民的爱国传统，表现了台湾人民的不屈不挠的精神。最近美国策动蒋介石集团的军事和特务人员，直接参加印度尼西亚叛乱分子的军事和颠覆活动。因而，更激起台湾人民对美国侵略者的愤慨。
    李纯青最后说：和台湾人民“五·二四”的反美大示威同样性质的反美示威正在世界各地不断发生。现在美国侵略者的处境就像人人喊打的过街老鼠一样。我们相信，台湾人民对美国的压迫是决不会屈服的。
    在会上发言的还有谢南光、杨春松、陈文彬、王万得、苏子蘅等人，他们表达了对今天仍在美帝国主义压迫下的台湾同胞的关怀。
