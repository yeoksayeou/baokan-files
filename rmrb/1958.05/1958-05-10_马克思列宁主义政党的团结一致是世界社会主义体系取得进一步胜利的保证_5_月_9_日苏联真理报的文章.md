    (I)
    Our era is an era of a series of historic victories for the world socialist system, characterized by the increasing unity and solidarity of the international communist movement and the growing consolidation of friendship among the people of socialist countries. United by common goals, Marxist-Leninist theory, and the principles of proletarian internationalism, the communist and workers' parties see themselves as an integral part of the great international communist movement and attach great importance to the activities and experiences of each fraternal party.

    The congresses of each communist and workers' party attract the attention of communists around the world. Therefore, the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, held in April and discussing such an important issue as the party program, also attracted the attention of communist and workers' parties of all countries. In the months before this congress, representatives of various fraternal communist and workers' parties held a historic meeting in Moscow and formulated the programmatic documents of the international communist movement—the Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and the Peace Manifesto. As everyone knows, the delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia signed the Peace Manifesto. However, it refused to participate in the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and did not sign the declaration adopted at this meeting.

    The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, published before the congress, has aroused severe criticism from the communist and workers' parties of many countries. The organs of fraternal communist and workers' parties—"L'Humanité" (France), "Unità" (Italy), "Trybuna Ludu" (Poland), "Tvorba" weekly (Czechoslovakia), "Scînteia" (Romania), "Társadalmi Szemle" (Hungary), "Rabotnichesko Delo" (Bulgaria), "Zëri i Popullit" (Albania), "The Daily Worker" (Britain), "Le Drapeau Rouge" (Belgium), etc., as well as statements by the Central Committees of the communist and workers' parties of many countries, pointed out that many principles in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are contrary to the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and run counter to the views of other communist parties on many extremely important principled issues reflected in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries. The sixth issue of the "Kommunist" magazine of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, published in April 1958, criticized the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    In early May, the "People's Daily," the organ of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, severely criticized the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the position of the Yugoslav leaders in an editorial entitled "Modern Revisionism Must Be Criticized." The editorial said, "An open and uncompromising criticism must be carried out against a series of anti-Marxist-Leninist and thoroughly revisionist views concentrated in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."

    As consistently pointed out by the press of various communist parties, many arguments in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are actually revisions of Marxism-Leninism. This is especially true in the clarification and evaluation of such extremely important issues as: the current international situation, the two world systems and two camps, the significance of the experience of the Soviet Union and other countries in building socialism, the role of the communist party and socialist countries building a new society, the development of Marxist-Leninist theory and the struggle against bourgeois ideology, the principle of proletarian internationalism, the mutual relations between socialist countries and fraternal communist parties, and many other extremely important issues related to Marxist theory and the practice of the world communist movement.

    The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia appears to be a document that confronts the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, which is endorsed by all fraternal communist parties. Therefore, the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a document that weakens, rather than strengthens, the unity of communist and workers' parties and the unity of socialist countries.

    Considering that speeches against the erroneous principles of the draft program would cause sharp debates and complicate relations between the parties, almost all communist parties (including the Communist Party of the Soviet Union) considered it appropriate not to send their delegations to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In this regard, the various fraternal parties hope that the Yugoslav comrades can correctly understand their comradely criticism of the draft program.

    However, at the congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav leaders angrily spoke of these criticisms of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, rejecting them "out of hand" and not substantively discussing them. The comradely criticism of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia led to accusations against the fraternal parties, accusing them of establishing "ideological monopoly," putting pressure on Yugoslavia, and infringing on its independence. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not draw the correct conclusions from the comradely criticism made by various communist parties on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia; they allowed the fraternal parties to be subjected to fierce and hysterical attacks at the congress, and stubbornly adhered to their own erroneous and essentially anti-Leninist attitude on many issues.

    The documents of the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia published in the newspapers show that some of the erroneous principles in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia were fully developed and maintained by the rapporteur and some speakers at the Congress. Principled criticism and resolute refutation must be carried out against such remarks.

    (II)
    We cannot ignore the fundamentally erroneous assessment of the international situation after World War II made by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, nor can we ignore its distortion of the causes of international tension and its distortion of the essence of Soviet foreign policy.

    According to the Yugoslav news agency, the report by Josip Broz Tito, General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, revealed the view that the policies of the great powers are based on the principle of force, not on the principle that the people of all countries have the right to decide their own destiny. The rapporteur said, "Some great powers after the war still use any means to achieve domination over the people of other countries and the world. Unfortunately, one example of this kind of diplomacy is the pressure Stalin put on Yugoslavia for many years." It can be seen from this passage that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia equate the Soviet Union with imperialist countries, and they seriously distort historical facts, insisting that the Soviet Union pursued a policy of "power politics," carried out aggression, and yearned for world hegemony.

    The whole world knows that the Soviet Union, which played a decisive role in crushing Hitler's fascism and liberating the enslaved people of all countries, has been waging a persistent and tenacious struggle for the democratic path of development, against the revival of fascism, and for socialism. Everyone also knows that, in contrast to the Soviet Union, the imperialist blocs considered their main task in the post-war period to be to "correct" the results of the world war, attempting to use the post-war structure to hinder the further development of democratic forces, and then to "squeeze out" and stifle the forces of socialism and national liberation movements. This policy of the imperialist countries was firmly resisted by the Soviet Union and all socialist forces.

    A series of countries broke away from the capitalist world system, established the power of the working people, and formed the world socialist system—this was the situation in the first few years after the war. The great role of the Soviet Union in this historical cause is visible to everyone. Its policy is a policy of selfless and friendly assistance to countries that have embarked on the path of socialist development. To say that the content of the Soviet Union's policy in the first few years after the war was the pursuit of "domination over other countries," as said by some speakers at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia—this is a repetition of the imperialist propaganda of the "Soviet empire" surrounded by so-called "satellite countries."

    This attempt to exonerate the imperialist countries and blame the Soviet Union for the international tensions that formed in the post-war period is most blatantly manifested in the accusations against the Soviet Union at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, who insisted that the Soviet Union's policy was a major reason for "the conclusion of the Atlantic Treaty."

    Developing this idea, Tito went so far as to say that the Soviet Union's policy gradually became isolated "due to the distrust of the people of other small countries in this socialist country," and that it was this policy that "strengthened the position of the Western countries headed by the United States... and in this regard temporarily gained the moral support of most of the world public opinion."

    And these words directed against the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union's peace-loving foreign policy were said at a time when the world socialist camp was formed, its strength was greatly strengthened after the victory of the great Chinese revolution in 1949, and all progressive people in the world stood with the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and all people's democracies, carrying out a just and noble struggle to consolidate peace in the world!

    Such a distortion of the Soviet Union's foreign policy and role cannot but arouse the indignation of all those who are actually actively opposed to imperialism and aggression, and opposed to the threat of a new war. The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "Unità" emphasized in response to this: "Tito's statement about the reasons for the world's division into blocs is unacceptable. We cannot agree with many reasons for this assessment. For example, it is easy to find that there is no analysis of imperialism, what imperialism is, and its consistent attempts to cause conflicts over the years. Without this analysis, it is easy to make such an assessment of the international situation: always seeing the Soviet Union's policy during the Stalin period as the root of all disasters, and as the reason for the weakening of the international workers' movement, but precisely in those years, we personally witnessed the weakening of imperialism's position in various regions of the world." "L'Humanité" refuted Yugoslavia's explanation of the reasons for the establishment of the North Atlantic bloc. It pointed out: "This explanation is extremely contradictory to the Peace Manifesto signed by the representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in Moscow." Distorting the real reasons for the establishment of the North Atlantic bloc is actually nothing more than defending American imperialism, which established this aggressive military bloc and used it as the main tool for seizing world hegemony.

    In May 1945, just after the end of World War II, American economists representing the interests of large monopoly capital said that a new war was ideal and even necessary for the United States, and does anyone not remember that the entire American diplomacy in the first few years after the war was based on atomic weapon intimidation and threats? Does anyone not remember that as early as 1946, Churchill called for the organization of a new crusade against the Soviet Union, launched the "Cold War," and expanded armaments in his shameless speech in Fulton (USA)? The military North Atlantic bloc has been and is serving the aggressive purposes of American imperialism.

    It is noteworthy that the rapporteur of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia abandoned the class viewpoint when analyzing the international situation, ignoring the indisputable fact that a fierce struggle is now taking place between the imperialist war forces and the peace forces headed by the socialist countries. Therefore, to use a vivid analogy made by a French Communist, it is to "cover up the harsh reality" and help the real culprits of the current international tension escape responsibility.

    When elaborating on Yugoslavia's foreign policy, Tito said, "It would be better if our foreign policy was the same as the policy of another country, specifically the Soviet Union's policy. We also hope that our policy and our views on international issues are as similar as possible to the policies and views of the United States and other Western countries."

    On the one hand, the leaders of the League of Communists consider their views to be communist views and their foreign policy to proceed from the interests of consolidating socialism, but on the other hand, they declare that they hope that Yugoslavia's policies and views are more similar to the policies and views of the United States. How strange does this sound!

    This attitude is not in line with the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, because it ignores the fundamental contradiction of modern social development—the contradiction between the imperialist and socialist systems. This attitude violates the assessment of the international situation in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, and violates recognized historical facts. The declaration emphasizes that "the aggressive groups of American imperialism are trying to dominate most countries in the world by relying on the so-called 'position of strength' policy, and are trying to hinder mankind from advancing according to the laws of social development... The policy of certain aggressive groups in the United States is to gather all the reactionary forces of the capitalist world around themselves. In this way, these groups become the center of reactionary forces around the world and the most ferocious enemies of the masses of the people."

    Opposing these clear assessments of the role of American imperialism, which are endorsed by the entire international communist movement, means pleasing the imperialists.

    (III)
    The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia do not agree with the assertion, unanimously recognized by communists of all countries, that the present world is divided into two opposing camps—the socialist camp and the imperialist camp. They say that Yugoslavia stands outside these two camps. However, it should be known that the division of the world into two camps is not the result of the whims of certain people or certain parties. The formation of the world socialist system, the emergence of the world socialist camp confronting the imperialist camp, and the division of the world into two camps are all the regular results of the historical process of the development of human society.

    The socialist camp and the imperialist camp reflect the irrefutable fact that there are now not one but two socio-economic systems in the world. One cannot equate military blocs with the socialist camp and the imperialist camp formed in the process of historical development, as the Yugoslav leaders do. Countries with different socio-economic structures can cooperate in a group (such as the anti-Hitler alliance during World War II), while camps are composed of countries of one type. In a group, the interests of the countries coincide with each other for a certain period of time. The imperialist countries' camp is united by their hatred of socialism. And the inherent selfish and contradictory interests of each imperialist country separate them. The aggressive policy of the imperialist countries, especially the ruling groups in the United States, and their desire to dominate the world are resisted by the people of all countries who have broken free from the shackles of colonial rule and are fighting for their independence.

    In the socialist camp, there are common interests and common goals, and there is no and cannot be antagonism.

    Tito's report said: "The division of the world into blocs has not led to economic integration and effective international cooperation in this regard, but has led to the division of the world economy, causing huge losses to the people of all countries." Of course, the division of the world into military blocs has caused and is causing great losses to the people of all countries, including in the economic aspect. The Soviet Union has always opposed dividing the world into blocs, constantly proposing various measures to ease international tensions, and striving to normalize foreign trade and eliminate economic discrimination. But the above-mentioned report turns the historical phenomenon upside down—putting the cart before the horse.

    The world economy has been divided due to the emergence of the world socialist system. Complaining about "economic division" is expressing regret about the emergence of the world socialist system. The task is not to artificially restore some unified world economy in violation of historical laws. This is impossible. Two economic systems exist now and will continue to exist for a long time. The task is to arrange the peaceful economic coexistence of the two systems so that the economic relations between the socialist world and the capitalist world are normalized.

    The issue of mutual relations between socialist countries and between the communist and workers' parties leading these countries is of utmost importance for the development of socialism and communism. This is a new issue that has only arisen after World War II, when some other socialist countries appeared in Europe and Asia besides the existing Soviet socialist country. The communist and workers' parties, following Marxism-Leninism, have formulated solid and unshakable principles for this relationship, which are reflected in the Declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries and have found theoretical basis.

    The declaration said: "The basis of mutual relations between countries in the world socialist system and between the communist and workers' parties in the world is the Marxist-Leninist principle tested by life, the principle of proletarian internationalism."

    "Socialist countries establish mutual relationships on the principles of complete equality, respect for territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, mutual non-interference in internal affairs. These principles are very important, but they do not include the entire essence of the mutual relations of socialist countries. Fraternal mutual assistance is an inseparable part of their mutual relations. This mutual assistance powerfully embodies the internationalist principle of socialism."

    Socialist countries can unite into a unified family because: they are taking the common socialist road, their socio-economic system and state power have the same class essence, they need mutual support and help, and their interests and goals are consistent in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism.

    Socialism has gone beyond the scope of one country and become a world socio-economic system. The formation and consolidation of the socialist countries' camp is the main factor determining international development and the characteristics of the present era. The emergence and development of the socialist camp proves that the general crisis of capitalism has deepened and sharpened, and it also proves the disintegration of the world capitalist system. The vigorous growth of the economic power and political influence of the socialist camp reflects the objective historical laws and reveals the future prospects of social development.

    Tito said: "We are often accused of not being internationalists because we did not participate in the camp. For these comrades, internationalism depends on whether or not to participate in the camp, not on whether or not to belong to the socialist world in a broader sense."

    It goes without saying that proletarian internationalism applies not only to the socialist camp; this idea also unites all Marxist-Leninist parties of the working class and unites the international workers' movement and the national liberation movement. However, it must not be concluded from this that it is not necessary to strengthen internationalist ties, fraternal cooperation, and mutual assistance among those countries where socialism has already triumphed. Communist and workers' parties, especially those acting as ruling parties, bear a major historical responsibility for the fate of the world socialist system. Therefore, for the sake of the entire international workers' movement and the cause of world peace and socialism, they are strengthening their unity and comradely cooperation. The socialist countries are united in a unified camp, the entire world communist movement actively supports this camp, and all progressive people sympathize with it - this is the vibrant creative cause of hundreds of millions of working people.

    Marx pointed out that the liberation of labor is not a local issue, nor a national issue, but a social issue involving all countries where modern society exists, and solving this issue depends on the practical and theoretical cooperation of the most advanced countries.

    Under the current conditions, when the new socialist society has united more than one-third of mankind, there is an urgent need to strengthen practical and theoretical cooperation between advanced countries.

    Under such conditions, Marx's words are particularly powerful: "The fraternal alliance that should exist between workers of all countries should prompt them to stand closely together in the struggle for liberation. Ignoring this alliance will punish their scattered forces with universal failure."

    However, the line pursued in the speeches at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia aimed to demonstrate the uniqueness of the socialist countries and to oppose them to each other. In this regard, the first thing adopted is a fictitious argument that does not conform to reality, that is, the concept of the socialist camp is linked to the "hegemonism" of this or that "leading country," and is linked to the concept of such parties, "whose leaders are accustomed to accepting and executing instructions from outside." This statement is no different from the clichés of the imperialist propaganda organs. It is precisely by using this kind of slander that the imperialists "argue" their subversive activities against the people's democratic countries, and they use the banner of "liberating" these countries to actually want to restore the capitalist system. The imperialists put forward these fabrications to attack the Communist Party, and they slander the Communist Party for "accepting foreign instructions."

    Now there are not one but many socialist countries, and it is impossible to build socialism and communism alone. The historical period when the Soviet people had to build socialism alone in one country has long passed. Now, socialism has become a world system. A new stage of socialist development has arrived. Marx and Lenin always understood the transition from capitalism to socialism as a world's historical natural process, not a narrow national historical natural process. Now, every socialist country, whether it is a large or small country, needs the help of other socialist countries and the entire international workers' movement.

    In the current situation where the world is divided into two systems and two camps, every socialist country can survive and develop successfully only because there is a socialist camp, and it can rely on the economic strength and political unity of this camp. It cannot be imagined that socialism can be built with the help of imperialists. Although capitalism has cultivated its own gravedigger—the proletariat, capitalism is not willing to give way to socialism and is unwilling to enter the grave quickly. The unified and united socialist world and the working people of all countries should unite to oppose the conspiracies of the world's imperialist reactionaries.

    (IV)
    At the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the rapporteur and some speakers gratefully spoke of the United States' aid to Yugoslavia. However, they were very reluctant to talk about economic cooperation with socialist countries, and the aid of socialist countries was underestimated and even ignored. The speeches at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia particularly emphasized the "philanthropic role" played by the United States in Yugoslavia's economic development.

    Josip Broz Tito emphasized in his report that the basis of Yugoslavia's relations with the United States is: mutual respect, equal cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs.

    The rapporteur said: "If there is any attempt that does not conform to this principle, it usually comes from certain individuals or groups, not from the US government. We received economic and military aid from the United States when we urgently needed aid, that is, when Stalin exerted political, economic, and propaganda pressure on our country. This greatly helped us overcome the great difficulties at that time."

    It seems that the US government originally gave Yugoslavia "selfless" aid, and only "certain individuals or groups" had made fruitless attempts to make the US government leave the path of mutual respect, equal cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs, and the US government still opposed these people! When reading this kind of speech that is servile and flattering to the US ruling groups, one cannot help but ask: Why do US monopoly capitalists feel so good about Yugoslavia? Every communist has the right to consider a question: Why do US imperialists—the most ferocious enemies of socialism—think it is worthwhile to help Yugoslavia? One of the earliest activists in the international workers' movement, Bebel, once said: "If the enemy praises me, it must be that I have done something stupid." However, here the US imperialists are not only praising the Yugoslav leaders, but also giving them "aid." What merit is this to reward? Is it because the Yugoslav leaders are trying to slander the Soviet Union and weaken the unity of the international communist movement and the workers' movement?

    It must be mentioned that before and after Josip Broz Tito made an unfriendly speech against the Soviet Union in Pula, which won unanimous praise from the world's reactionaries, Yugoslavia received new large sums of bonuses from US imperialism. According to Yugoslav newspapers, on November 3, 1956, Yugoslavia signed an agreement with the United States on the United States supplying surplus agricultural products worth 98.3 million US dollars. According to the Yugoslav News Agency, at the end of December 1956, the US government gave Yugoslavia a check for about 6 billion dinars. The delegation of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia had just refused to sign the declaration of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, and the United States immediately gave Yugoslavia a huge loan and signed an agreement to supply US surplus agricultural products worth 62.5 million US dollars. It is possible that the new attempt by the Yugoslav leaders to weaken the unity of socialist countries and the Communist Party will also be appropriately rewarded.

    Imperialists never give gifts to anyone for nothing.

    Everyone knows that the United States' aid to other countries is by no means selfless, but creates economic and political dependence on it in various ways. Under the guise of this "aid," American monopoly organizations sell various obsolete goods and outdated military equipment to other countries. This aid from American monopoly organizations cannot promote the development of an independent national economy in countries that enjoy this aid.

    As a result of the so-called selfless aid of US imperialism, Yugoslavia's total foreign debt has reached a huge figure of more than 800 million US dollars. Yugoslavia has to use more than 25% of its export revenue each year to repay foreign debt. Like other countries that receive "US aid," Yugoslavia mainly receives surplus agricultural products such as wheat and lard from US monopoly organizations. However, US monopoly organizations are unwilling to import complete equipment for factories and power stations to Yugoslavia through aid, as well as all equipment necessary for the development of modern industry, national technological progress, and economic progress.

    The economic relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are built on another basis. The report of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia listed the most important agreements signed between the two countries in recent years. The first is an agreement on the construction of enterprises worth 110 million US dollars in Yugoslavia. In addition, the agreement on the Soviet Union providing Yugoslavia with a goods loan of 54 million US dollars, a gold or foreign exchange loan of 30 million US dollars, and special agreements on the construction of aluminum plants and fertilizer plants were mentioned.

    Even this brief table of various agreements between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia shows the fundamental and principled difference between the economic relations of the Soviet Union with Yugoslavia and other socialist countries and the so-called US aid. The purpose of US "aid" is to make the "aided" countries dependent on the United States, while the Soviet Union strives to actually help other socialist countries and economically underdeveloped countries consolidate and develop their economies and achieve industrialization, as the basis for these countries' economic and political independence and national sovereignty.

    When talking about the current economic relations between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, Tito said that this is "economic cooperation that is very beneficial to both countries."

    However, the Soviet working people give Yugoslavia friendly assistance, not from the consideration that doing so is "very beneficial" to them from a commercial point of view. If only from a purely commercial point of view, then it would be more beneficial for the Soviet Union to use these funds to build new factories in its own country and then export finished products. The Soviet people are far from proceeding from that purely commercial point of view in their relations with countries receiving economic assistance. In their policies, in their relations with fraternal socialist countries, they are based on the interests of building socialism, and the interests of consolidating and developing the world socialist system. The Soviet Union also gives fraternal assistance to the people of all countries who are fighting for freedom and independence against colonial oppression. Helping comrades and friends is fulfilling one's international obligations. This is how the Soviet people consider and act on this basis.

    However, the drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia rudely distorted the nature of the relations between socialist countries, and said in an unfriendly and even slanderous tone that they coveted hegemony, and that in the initial stage of socialist development, some nations and some countries might "use this or that form to carry out economic exploitation of other countries." Does anyone in Yugoslavia think that this "exploitation" tendency is manifested in the Soviet Union's economic relations with Yugoslavia? If so, then Yugoslavia can be allowed to get rid of this "exploitation."

    We do not force anyone to accept anything. We do not force anyone to accept our state system, our social way of life, and our ideological system. We do not force anyone to accept our friendship and our economic assistance either.

    (V)
    The Yugoslav leaders say that the existing ideological differences should not lead to the deterioration of state relations between Yugoslavia and socialist countries. However, experience shows that it is not enough to just repeat this truth. It cannot be ignored that if ideological differences are not eliminated but continue to deepen, then they will naturally cause differences on political issues. It would be strange if the relations between socialist countries were strengthened and improved, but the relations between the parties leading these countries, which have a common Marxist-Leninist ideological system, deteriorated.

    The Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have resolutely eliminated the past unfairness and errors in their treatment of Yugoslavia. However, it should be frankly pointed out that in 1948 and after that, the Yugoslav side committed errors of a nationalistic nature, and deviated from the principles of Marxism-Leninism on some important issues.

    While restoring friendly relations with Yugoslavia, the Soviet people also understood that there were serious ideological differences between our party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. These differences had accumulated when Yugoslavia was separated from the international communist movement, and overcoming these differences would encounter many difficulties. The only solid foundation for establishing friendly relations between the two parties can only be the principles of Marxism-Leninism. This has been emphasized more than once in the joint statement of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and it is reflected in the Belgrade Declaration and the Moscow Declaration.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union has shown initiative in normalizing relations with Yugoslavia and has persevered in fulfilling its obligations consistently. The actions of the Yugoslav leaders, however, were not like this. The Chinese "People's Daily" editorial justly emphasized: "Since 1954, the Soviet Union and the socialist camp countries have taken various measures to improve relations with Yugoslavia with the utmost benevolence. This is completely correct and necessary. The communist parties of all countries have adopted a patient waiting attitude, hoping that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will return to the Marxist-Leninist position, so as to help the Yugoslav people adhere to the socialist path. However, the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia rejected the well-intentioned efforts of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the communists of all countries."

    The Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia clearly show that the Yugoslav leaders continue to stand on a position that violates the principles of Marxism-Leninism. They see this as their special bravery. Tito said in his closing speech at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia: "...If anyone expects us to abandon our principled position on international and internal issues, this will only waste time and cause losses to all of us." Holding this "principled position," the Yugoslav leaders in their speeches called the communists of the Soviet Union and the communists of other countries "dogmatists," "opportunistic pragmatists," "utilitarianists," "practical dogmatists," and so on. Some Yugoslav speakers indulged in using all kinds of sensational words and harsh terms in their attacks on the communist parties of other countries.

    These actions of the Yugoslav leaders show that they have rudely violated the principles of proletarian internationalism. Their actions violate a very important point of Lenin, which is: "The cause of defeating capitalism cannot be successfully completed if the proletariat and the entire working masses of all countries and nations in the world do not voluntarily strive to form alliances and unite."

    On the podium of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, someone said with unprecedented arrogance that the actions of the Yugoslav leaders were like... Lenin's struggle for the victory of Marxist principles. This statement is simply an insult. This statement means opposing the Yugoslav communists to the worldwide communist movement, which is supposedly mired in the swamp of dogmatism, and comparing the communist parties of all countries to the social democrats of the Second International, against whose opportunism Lenin had waged a relentless struggle.

    The Yugoslav leaders adopt an incorrect position and violate the norms of party-to-party relations and the principles of proletarian internationalism recognized by all Marxist-Leninist parties. This is particularly manifested in their incorrect treatment of principled party criticism. They rudely accused others of interfering in Yugoslavia's internal affairs to respond to the comradely criticisms of the shortcomings and errors in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. This important issue must be clarified. Since the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia sent its draft program to all fraternal parties, how can other communist parties be blamed for wanting to interfere in Yugoslavia's internal affairs? Why send the draft program to fraternal parties? Obviously, it is to ask everyone to express their opinions on the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. But when others express this opinion, extremely impolite attacks begin to fall on the heads of the fraternal parties.

    The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that they have the right to make arbitrary and arrogant evaluations of the international workers' movement, saying: "The development of the international workers' movement in recent decades has not kept pace with the development of social events and material conditions." This actually means that everyone else is out of step, only my pace is consistent!

    The whole world knows how great and truly historically significant victories the international communist movement has won, and how great work the communist parties of all countries have done among the masses.

    The Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia pointed to the communist parties of many countries and said: "These parties are not bold and active enough in the struggle to attract the masses, they are conservative and detached from the masses, so they cannot play a decisive role in the social development of their own countries." But who doesn't know that in many capitalist countries, such as the United States, West Germany, and Spain, the Communist Party struggles in an environment of extremely brutal police persecution, brutal terror, and provocation? Ask the communists in the United States, and they will tell you how the imperialists have destroyed the communist movement in the United States in the past and now. All communists know that more than 30 communist parties have been declared illegal in capitalist countries. But what do the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia care about this?

    At the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, someone insisted that it is impossible to have a correct and infallible judge in ideological issues who can determine who is right and who is wrong, and the only and final judge is practice and history. Of course, the viewpoint of life and the scale of social practice should be the primary and basic thing to determine whether this or that argument is correct and true. In the final analysis, theoretical conclusions can be confirmed or refuted in history. However, has history not confirmed the correctness of the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism? Has the practice of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction not shown the great vitality of these principles? Then why can't these Marxist-Leninist principles, which have been tested by the struggle experience of millions of workers and peasants in different countries for a better life, become the guiding light, compass, and standard of truth in ideological debates? To deny this is to oppose the correctness of Marxist-Leninist principles, and it is to treat the issue of truth with a relativistic nihilistic viewpoint, and for relativistic nihilism, there are no fixed principles, beliefs, and truths.

    It is ridiculous to think that in this century, when many countries have well-trained Marxist-Leninist parties with rich experience and great influence on the masses, only one party, for example, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, can promote socialist ideology and the theory of Marxism-Leninism, and is able to see the correct solution to the urgent problems of the communist movement, while all the remaining parties are supposedly destined - to use Kardelj's contemptuous words - to "stay in place."

    Other speakers like Perović, a member of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, went even further, saying: "We have heard a lot about the 'collective Marxist-Leninist viewpoint,' which refers to the resolutions of the central hubs of certain parties. In this regard, people say that the correctness of the views of the central hubs of the parties cannot be doubted. This has nothing to do with Marxism-Leninism." However, in reality, this attack on the fraternal communist parties has nothing in common with Marxism-Leninism.

    Marxism-Leninism and socialist ideology are developing, advancing, enriched by the living experience of millions of fighters for socialism, and enriched by the great and multifaceted activities of all fraternal communist and workers' parties. Combining the specific characteristics of their own countries, they creatively apply and develop Marxist-Leninist theory in new historical conditions. The communist parties of China, France, Italy, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Albania, Britain, Spain, Latin American countries, India, Indonesia, Finland, and other countries have made great contributions to the development of the theory, strategy, and tactics of Marxism-Leninism.

    马克思列宁主义政党的团结一致是世界社会主义体系取得进一步胜利的保证
    ——5月9日苏联真理报的文章
    （一）
    我们的时代是世界社会主义体系取得一连串历史性胜利的时代，它的特点是：国际共产主义运动日益团结一致，各个社会主义国家人民的友谊日益巩固。由一致的目标、马克思列宁主义理论和无产阶级国际主义的原则团结起来的共产党和工人党都把自己看做是伟大的国际共产主义运动的一个组成部分，并对每个兄弟党的活动和经验都很重视。
    各个共产党和工人党的代表大会都吸引全世界共产党人的注意。因此，4月间举行的、讨论了像党纲这样一个重要问题的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会，也引起了各国共产党和工人党的注意。在这次代表大会以前的几个月，各兄弟共产党和工人党代表曾经在莫斯科举行了历史性的会议，制定了国际共产主义运动的纲领性的文件——社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言和和平宣言。大家知道，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团在和平宣言上签了字。但是，它拒绝参加社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议，没有在这个会议所通过的宣言上签字。
    在代表大会以前发表的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案引起了许多国家共产党和工人党的严厉批评。兄弟共产党和工人党的机关报——“人道报”（法国）、“团结报”（意大利）、“人民论坛报”（波兰）、“创造”周刊（捷克斯洛伐克）、“火花报”（罗马尼亚）、“社会评论”（匈牙利）、“工人事业报”（保加利亚）、“人民之声报”（阿尔巴尼亚）、“工人日报”（英国）、“红旗报”（比利时）等等，以及许多国家共产党和工人党中央委员会的声明，都指出，南共纲领草案中的许多原理是违背马克思列宁主义基本原则的，是同其他共产党对反映在社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中的许多极重要的原则性问题的观点背道而驰的。1958年4月出版的苏联共产党中央委员会的“共产党人”杂志第六期批评了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案。
    5月初，中国共产党中央机关报“人民日报”在“现代修正主义必须批判”这篇社论中严厉批评了南共纲领草案和南斯拉夫领导人的立场。社论说，“对于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案所集中起来的一系列反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的观点，必须进行公开的毫不调和的批判。”
    正如各国共产党报刊所一致指出的，在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领草案中有许多论点实际上是对马克思列宁主义的修正。在对下列这些极重要的问题的阐明和估价上尤其如此，例如：当前国际局势，两个世界体系和两个阵营，苏联和其他国家建设社会主义的经验的意义，共产党和社会主义国家在建设新社会中的作用，马克思列宁主义理论的发展和同资产阶级意识形态的斗争，无产阶级国际主义原则，社会主义国家之间和兄弟共产党之间的相互关系，以及有关马克思主义理论和世界共产主义运动实践的许多其他极重要的问题。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案看来是同所有兄弟共产党所赞同的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言相对抗的文件。因此，南共纲领草案不是巩固、而是削弱共产党和工人党的团结、削弱社会主义国家团结的文件。
    考虑到在代表大会上发表反对纲领草案的错误原则的言论将会引起尖锐的争论、从而会使各党之间的关系复杂起来，因此，几乎所有的共产党（其中包括苏联共产党），都认为不派遣自己的代表团参加南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会是适宜的。在这方面，各个兄弟党都希望南斯拉夫的同志们能正确地理解它们对纲领草案所作的同志式的批评。
    但是，南斯拉夫的领导人在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表大会上激怒地谈到对南共纲领草案的这些批评，把这些批评拒之于“门外”，不对它们作实质的讨论。对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的同志式的批评招致了对兄弟党的指责，说它们建立“思想垄断”、对南斯拉夫施加压力、侵犯它的独立。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人从各个共产党对南共纲领草案所作的同志式的批评中没有得出正确的结论；他们听任在代表大会上对兄弟党进行猛烈的、歇斯底里的攻击，并在许多问题上顽固地坚持自己错误的、在实质上是反列宁主义的态度。
    在报纸上发表的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会的文件表明，南共纲领草案中一些错误的原则在代表大会上得到了报告人和某些发言人全面的发展和维护。对于这样的言论必须进行原则性的批评和坚决的驳斥。
    二
    不能忽视南共第七次代表大会对第二次世界大战后国际局势所作的原则上错误的估计，也不能忽视它对国际紧张局势原因的曲解和对苏联外交政策实质的歪曲。
    根据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟总书记铁托的报告中流露出这样一种看法：大国的政策是以武力原则为基础的，而不是以各国人民有权自己决定自己命运的原则为基础的。报告人说，“某些大国在战后也还不择任何手段来达到对其他国家人民和全世界的统治。遗憾的是，这种外交政策的例子之一是斯大林多年来一直对南斯拉夫施加压力”。从这一段话中可以看出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人把苏联同帝国主义国家混为一谈，他们严重歪曲历史事实，硬说苏联奉行“实力地位”政策、进行侵略和渴望世界霸权。
    全世界都知道，在粉碎希特勒法西斯和解放被奴役的各国人民方面起决定作用的苏联，为争取民主发展道路、反对法西斯复活和争取社会主义而进行始终不渝的顽强斗争。大家也知道，与苏联相反，帝国主义集团认为自己在战后时期的主要任务是，“纠正”世界大战的结果，企图用战后的结构来阻碍民主力量进一步发展，而后“排挤”、窒息社会主义和民族解放运动的力量。帝国主义国家的这种方针受到苏联和所有社会主义力量的坚决反击。
    一系列国家脱离了资本主义世界体系，在这些国家中建立了劳动人民政权，形成了社会主义世界体系——这就是战后头几年的情况。苏联在这个历史事业中的伟大作用是每个人都看得见的。它的政策是对走上社会主义发展道路的国家进行无私的友好援助的政策。说什么苏联在战后头几年的政策的内容是追求“对其他国家进行统治”，像南共第七次代表大会的一些发言中所说的那样——这是重复帝国主义宣传的由所谓“卫星国家”围绕着的“苏联帝国”那一套污蔑。
    这种为帝国主义国家开脱、把战后时期形成的国际紧张局势的过错归罪于苏联的企图，在南共第七次代表大会上对苏联的指责中表现得最为露骨，他们硬说苏联的政策是促成“缔结大西洋公约的主要原因。”
    铁托把这种思想加以发展，竟然说苏联的政策“由于其他小国人民对这一社会主义国家的不信任”而使它逐渐陷于孤立，并且说正是这一政策“加强了以美国为首的西方国家的地位，……而且在这方面暂时得到了大部分世界舆论在道义上的支持”。
    而针对苏联和苏联爱好和平的外交政策所说的这些话是在这样一个时期说的：这时形成了世界社会主义阵营，它的力量在伟大的中国革命于1949年胜利以后大大加强了，世界一切进步人士都同苏联、中华人民共和国、所有人民民主国家站在一起，为巩固全世界的和平而进行正义的崇高的斗争！
    这样歪曲苏联的外交政策和作用，不能不引起一切在实际上积极反对帝国主义和侵略、反对新战争威胁的人们的愤慨。意大利共产党机关报“团结报”针对这一点强调指出：“铁托关于世界分裂成集团的原因的说法是不能接  受的。我们对这种评价的许多理由不能同意。例如，很容易发现，其中对帝国主义、对帝国主义究竟为何物、对它这些年来一贯想引起冲突的图谋，根本没有进行分析。而没有这种分析，就很容易对国际局势作出这样的评价：总是把斯大林时期的苏联政策看作是一切灾祸的根源，看作是国际工人运动削弱的原因，然而恰恰在那些年代，我们却亲眼看到帝国主义在世界各个地区的地位削弱了。”“人道报”驳斥了南斯拉夫对建立北大西洋集团的原因的解释。它指出：“这种解释是同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表在莫斯科签署的和平宣言极端矛盾的”。歪曲建立北大西洋集团的真正原因，实际上无非就是为建立这个侵略性军事集团并用它来作为攫取世界霸权的主要工具的美国帝国主义辩解。
    1945年5月，第二次世界大战刚刚结束，代表大垄断资本利益的美国经济学家就说，对美国来讲，新战争是理想的、甚至是必要的，而整个美国外交在战后头几年就是以原子武器恫吓和威胁为基础的，这一点难道有谁不记得吗？还在1946年，丘吉尔在富尔敦（美国）发表的无耻演说中就号召组织对苏联的新讨伐，发动“冷战”和扩充军备，这一点难道有谁不记得吗？军事性的北大西洋集团过去和现在都正是为美国帝国主义的侵略目的服务的。
    有一种情况十分引人注意，这就是南共第七次代表大会的报告人在分析国际局势时抛弃了阶级观点，忽视了这样一个不容分辩的事实：现在在帝国主义战争势力和以社会主义国家为首的和平力量之间正在进行残酷的斗争。因此，用一位法国共产党员所作的生动的比喻来说，就是“遮掩起严酷的实情”，帮助当前国际紧张局势的真正罪人摆脱责任。
    铁托在阐明南斯拉夫外交政策时说，“如果我国外交政策同另外某个国家的政策、具体说同苏联政策相同时，那就更好了。我们也希望，我国的政策和我们对国际问题的观点尽可能多地同美国和其他西方国家的政策和观点相同。”
    共产主义者联盟的领导人一方面认为自己观点是共产主义的观点、自己的外交政策从巩固社会主义的利益出发，另一方面却又声明希望南斯拉夫的政策和观点更多地同美国的政策和观点相同，这听起来是多么令人奇怪！
    这种态度是不符合马克思列宁主义精神的，因为它无视现代社会发展的基本矛盾——帝国主义和社会主义体系之间的矛盾。这种态度违背社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言对国际局势的估计，违背公认的历史事实。宣言中强调指出，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓‘实力地位’政策统治世界上的大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进……美国某些侵略集团的政策是要把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样，这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。”
    反对整个国际共产主义运动所赞同的、对美帝国主义作用的这些明确的估计，这意味着讨好帝国主义者。
    三
    南共的领导人不同意各国共产党人一致公认的现今世界分为两个对立的阵营——社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营的说法。他们说，南斯拉夫站在这两个阵营之外。然而，要知道，世界分为两个阵营并不是哪些人或哪些党派异想天开的结果。世界社会主义体系的形成、与帝国主义阵营相抗衡的世界社会主义阵营的出现，世界分为两个阵营，这些都是人类社会发展的历史过程的合乎规律的结果。
    社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营反映这样一个不可辩驳的事实：现在世界上存在着不是一个而是两个社会经济体系。不能像南斯拉夫领导人那样，把军事集团同在历史发展过程中形成的社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营划一个等号。社会经济结构不同的国家可以在一个集团中进行合作（例如第二次世界大战年代里的反希特勒联盟），而阵营则是由一种类型的国家组成的。在集团中，各国的利益在一定时间内是互相符合的。帝国主义国家阵营是由它们对社会主义的仇恨结合起来的。而每个帝国主义国家固有的那些自私和相互矛盾的利益又使它们分离。帝国主义国家、首先是美国统治集团的侵略政策，它们要统治世界的欲望，遭到那些摆脱了殖民统治的枷锁并在为自己的独立而斗争的各国人民的反抗。
    在社会主义阵营中，有着共同的利益，共同的目标，这里没有、也不可能有对抗。
    铁托的报告中说：“世界分裂为集团，没有导致经济的联合和在这方面实行有效的国际合作，而是引起了世界经济的分裂，给各国人民造成巨大的损失”。当然，世界分裂成军事集团过去和现在都给各国人民造成很大的损失，其中也包括经济方面。苏联一直反对把世界分成集团，不断提出缓和国际紧张局势的各项措施，并为争取对外贸易的正常化、消除经济方面的歧视现象而斗争。但是上述报告中把历史现象本末倒置了——把马车套到马的前头去了。
    世界经济由于社会主义世界体系的出现而分裂。抱怨“经济分裂”，也就是对社会主义世界体系的产生表示遗憾。任务并不在于硬要违反历史规律去人为地恢复什么统一的世界经济。这是不可能的。两个经济体系现在存在、并且还要长期存在下去。任务在于安排好两个体系的和平经济共处，使得社会主义世界同资本主义世界之间的经济关系正常起来。
    社会主义国家之间和领导这些国家的共产党和工人党之间的相互关系问题对社会主义和共产主义的发展有着极重要的意义。这是一个新的问题，它只是在第二次世界大战以后、当国际舞台上除了已有的苏维埃社会主义国家之外在欧亚两洲又出现了一些其他社会主义国家的时候才产生的。共产党和工人党遵循着马克思列宁主义，制定了这种关系的坚实的、不可动摇的原则，这些原则在社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中得到反映、并找到了理论根据。
    宣言说：“世界社会主义体系各国之间以及世界各国共产党和工人党之间相互关系的基础，是为生活所考验过的马克思列宁主义原则，是无产阶级国际主义原则。”
    “社会主义各国把相互关系建立在完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则上。这些原则是很重要的，但是还没有包括社会主义国家的相互关系的全部实质。兄弟般的互相援助，是它们的相互关系的不可分割的部分。这种互相援助有力地体现了社会主义的国际主义原则”。
    社会主义国家所以能够团结成为一个统一的大家庭，是因为：它们走着共同的社会主义道路，它们的社会经济制度和国家政权有着共同的阶级实质，它们需要互相支持和帮助，在争取社会主义和共产主义的胜利的斗争中它们的利益和目标是一致的。
    社会主义越出一个国家的范围而变成一种世界社会经济体系、社会主义国家阵营的形成和巩固，是决定国际发展、决定现时代特点的主要因素。社会主义阵营的产生和发展证明，资本主义总危机深刻化了、尖锐化了，也证明了世界资本主义体系的瓦解。社会主义阵营经济威力和政治影响的蓬勃增长反映了客观的历史规律，揭示出社会发展的未来远景。
    铁托说：“经常有人指责我们不是国际主义者，因为我们没有参加阵营。对于这些同志来说，国际主义就取决于是否参加阵营，而不是是否属于更广泛意义的社会主义世界。”
    不言而喻，无产阶级国际主义不仅仅适用于社会主义阵营，这种思想还把工人阶级的一切马克思列宁主义政党联合起来，把国际工人运动和民族解放运动团结起来。但是，决不能由此得出结论，认为在社会主义已经取得胜利的那些国家之间不必加强国际主义联系、兄弟合作和互助了。共产党和工人党，特别是那些作为执政党的共产党和工人党，对世界社会主义体系的命运负有重大的历史责任。因此，为了整个国际工人运动、全世界和平和社会主义事业的利益，它们正在加强自己的团结和同志式的合作。社会主义国家团结在一个统一的阵营里，整个世界共产主义运动对这个阵营的积极支持，全体进步人士对它的同情——这是数以亿计的劳动人民的生气蓬勃的创造性事业。
    马克思指出了，劳动的解放不是一个地方问题，也不是民族问题，而是一个涉及所有存在着现代社会的国家的社会问题，解决这个问题要靠最先进的国家在实践上的合作和理论上的合作。
    在目前的条件下，当新的社会主义社会已经把三分之一以上的人类团结在一起的时候，加强先进国家之间在实践上的合作和理论上的合作就有了迫切的需要。
    在这样的条件下，马克思的这句话就特别有力，他说：“各国工人之间应当存在的兄弟联盟应当促使他们在争取解放的斗争中彼此紧密地站在一起，忽视这种联盟就会使他们的分散的力量遭到普遍失败的惩罚”。
    然而，南共代表大会的发言中所奉行的路线，其目的却是论证社会主义国家的独特性和把它们彼此对立起来。在这方面首先采用的是这样一种臆想出来的、不符合实际情况的论点，即社会主义阵营的概念是同这个或那个“领导国家”的“霸权主义”联系在一起的，是同关于这样的党的概念联系在一起的，“这些党的领导习惯于接受和执行来自外部的指示”。这种说法同帝国主义宣传机关的陈词滥调是毫无区别的。帝国主义者正是利用这种谰言来“论证”它们对人民民主国家的颠覆活动，它们打着“解放”这些国家的幌子，实际上是想使资本主义制度复辟。帝国主义者提出这些?造的论据来攻讦共产党，他们污蔑共产党“接受外来的指示”。
    现在，社会主义国家已经不是一个而是很多个，单独地建设社会主义和共产主义是不可能的。苏联人民曾经不得不单独在一国建设社会主义，这种历史时期早已过去了。现在，社会主义已经成为世界体系。社会主义发展的新阶段已经来到。马克思和列宁一向就把从资本主义向社会主义的过渡理解为世界的历史自然过程，而不是狭隘民族主义的历史自然过程。现在，每一个社会主义国家，无论它是大国或小国，都需要其他社会主义国家和整个国际工人运动的帮助。
    在世界分裂成两个体系、两个阵营的目前情况下，每一个社会主义国家之所以能够生存和顺利地向前发展，只是因为有社会主义阵营存在，可以依靠这个阵营的经济实力和政治团结。不能设想可以依靠帝国主义者的帮助来建设社会主义。虽然资本主义养成了自己的掘墓人——无产阶级，但是资本主义并不甘愿让位给社会主义，不愿意快点进入坟墓。统一的团结的社会主义世界和各国劳动人民应当齐心一致来反对世界帝国主义反动派的阴谋。
    四
    在南共代表大会上，报告人和某些发言者都感激地谈到美国对南斯拉夫的援助。但是在谈到同社会主义国家的经济合作时却十分勉强，社会主义国家的援助被估计得过低，甚至被忽视。在南共代表大会的发言里特别强调美国在南斯拉夫经济发展中所起的“乐善好施的作用”。
    约·铁托在他的报告中强调指出，南斯拉夫同美国的关系的基础是：相互尊重、平等合作和互不干涉内政。
    报告人说：“如果有某种企图不符合这一原则的话，那通常是来自某些个人或集团，而不是美国政府也是这样的。我们在极其需要援助，即斯大林对我国施加政治、经济和宣传压力的时候，我们从美国得到了经济和军事援助。这在很大程度上帮助我们克服了当时的巨大困难。”
    这样看来，原来美国政府给了南斯拉夫“无私的”援助，只是“某些个人或集团”曾经徒劳无益地企图使美国政府离开相互尊重、平等合作和互不干涉内政的道路，美国政府还是反对这些人的呢！读到这种对美国统治集团卑躬屈节和奉承拍马的演说时，不禁要问：美国垄断资本家为什么对南斯拉夫这样有好感呢？每个共产党人都有权考虑一个问题：为什么美国帝国主义者——社会主义的最凶恶的敌人——认为帮助南斯拉夫是上算的呢？国际工人运动最早的活动家之一——倍倍尔曾经说过：“如果敌人夸奖我，那一定是我做了什么愚蠢的事”。然而，这里美国帝国主义者不仅是夸奖南斯拉夫领导人，而且还给他们“援助”。这是为了酬谢什么功劳呢？是不是因为南斯拉夫领导人企图诽谤苏联、削弱国际共产主义运动和工人运动的团结呢？
    不能不提到，约·铁托在普拉发表博得全世界反动派一致喝彩的对苏联不友好的演说前后，南斯拉夫从美国帝国主义那里得到了新的大批奖金。据南斯拉夫报纸报道，1956年11月3日，南斯拉夫同美国签订了一项关于美国供给价值九千八百三十万美元的剩余农产品的协定，而根据南斯拉夫通讯社报道，在1956年12月底，美国政府又把一张约六十亿第纳尔的支票交给了南斯拉夫。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表团刚刚拒绝在社会主义国家共产党和工人党宣言上签字，美国马上就给了南斯拉夫一笔巨额贷款，并签订了供给价值六千二百五十万美元的美国剩余农产品的协定。可能，南斯拉夫领导人削弱社会主义国家和共产党的团结的新企图也将得适当的奖赏。
    帝国主义者从来不向任何人白送礼物。
    谁都知道，美国对其他国家的援助决不是无私的，而是通过种种方式造成这些国家在经济上和政治上对它的依赖。美国垄断组织打着这种“援助”的幌子，向别国推销各种陈货和老式军备。美国垄断组织的这种援助，不能促进享有这种援助的国家独立的民族经济的发展。
    由于美帝国主义的所谓无私援助的结果，南斯拉夫对外国债总额达到了八亿多美元的巨大数字。南斯拉夫每年要用出口收益的25％以上偿还外债。南斯拉夫也像其他获得“美援”的国家一样，从美国垄断组织得到的主要是小麦、猪油等剩余农产品。但是，美国垄断组织却不愿意通过援助的方式向南斯拉夫输入工厂和电站用的完善设备以及发展现代工业、国家技术进步和经济进步所必需的一切设备。
    至于苏南两国的经济关系却建筑在另外一种基础上。南共第七次代表大会的报告列举了最近几年两国所签订的最重要的协定。首先是关于在南斯拉夫建设价值达一亿一千万美元的企业的协定。此外，还提到了苏联向南斯拉夫提供五千四百万美元的货物贷款协定，三千万美元的黄金或外汇贷款协定，关于建设制铝厂、肥料厂的专门协定等等。
    即便是这个苏联和南斯拉夫之间各项协定的简表也表明，苏联跟南斯拉夫以及其他社会主义国家的经济关系同所谓美援的根本的、原则性区别在什么地方。美“援”的目的是为了使被“援助”的国家依赖美国，而苏联则竭力在实际上帮助其他社会主义国家以及经济不发达的国家巩固和发展自己的经济并实现工业化，以作为这些国家经济和政治独立以及国家主权的基础。
    在谈到目前苏联和南斯拉夫的经济关系时，铁托说这是“对两国都很有利的经济合作”。
    然而，苏联劳动人民给予南斯拉夫以友好援助，绝不是从这样做在商业观点看对他们“很有利”这种考虑出发的。如果仅从纯商业的角度考虑，那么苏联用这些资金在本国建立新的工厂，然后输出成品，当然更为有利。在同接受经济援助的国家的关系上苏联人远不是从那种纯商业的角度出发的。他们在自己的政策中，在同兄弟社会主义国家的关系上根据的是建设社会主义的利益、巩固和发展世界社会主义体系的利益。苏联也给予为反对殖民主义压迫、争取自由和独立而斗争的各国人民以兄弟援助。帮助同志和朋友，这就是履行自己的国际义务。苏联人就是这样考虑并且以此为根据来行事的。
    但是，南共纲领草案的起草人粗暴地歪曲了社会主义国家之间关系的性质，以不友好的、甚而诽谤的口吻硬说它们觊觎霸权，硬说在社会主义发展的最初阶段，某些民族和某些国家有可能“利用这种或那种形式对其他国家实行经济剥削”。在南斯拉夫是否有人认为，苏联同南斯拉夫的经济关系中表现了这种“剥削”倾向呢？假如是这样，那么倒可以让南斯拉夫摆脱这种“剥削”。
    我们不强迫任何人接受任何东西。我们不强迫任何人接受我们的国家制度、我们的社会生活方式和我们的思想体系。我们也不强迫任何人接受我们的友谊，接受我们的经济援助。
    五
    南斯拉夫领导人说，现有的意识形态的分歧不应当导致南斯拉夫和社会主义国家之间国家关系的恶化。但是，经验表明，光是重复这一真理是不够的。不能不看到，意识形态的分歧假如不是消除、而是继续加深，那么自然也就会引起政治问题上的分歧。假如社会主义国家之间的关系加强了和改善了，但是具有共同的马克思列宁主义思想体系的、领导这些国家的政党之间的关系却恶化了，这是会令人感到奇怪的。
    苏联和苏联共产党坚决地消除了过去对待南斯拉夫的不公平和错误。但是，应当直率指出，在1948年和在这以后，南斯拉夫方面犯了民族主义性质的错误，在一些重要问题上脱离了马克思列宁主义原则。
    在同南斯拉夫恢复友好关系的同时，苏联人也了解，我们党同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟存在有严重的意识形态方面的分歧，这些分歧是南斯拉夫在脱离国际共产主义运动时期所积累下来的，而要克服这些分歧，将要碰到不少的困难。建立两党友好关系的唯一牢靠的基础只能是马克思列宁主义的原则。这一点在苏联共产党和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的联合声明中曾经不止一次地强调过，这反映在贝尔格莱德宣言和莫斯科宣言中。
    苏联共产党在同南斯拉夫关系正常化方面表现了主动精神，并坚持不懈地、始终不渝地履行了自己的义务。南斯拉夫领导人的行动却不是这样。中国“人民日报”社论公正地着重指出：“从1954年以来，苏联和社会主义阵营各国仁至义尽地采取各种措施，以改善同南斯拉夫的关系，这是完全正确的，必要的。各国共产党采取耐心等待的态度，希望南共领导人回到马克思列宁主义的立场上来，以利于南斯拉夫人民坚持社会主义的道路。但是，南共领导集团拒绝了苏共中央和各国共产党人的善意的努力”。
    南共第七次代表大会、南共纲领草案清楚地表明了，南斯拉夫领导人继续站在违背马克思列宁主义原则的立场上。他们把这看成是自己特别勇敢。铁托在南共第七次代表大会上的闭幕词中说：“……任何方面有人期待我们放弃我们在国际问题和内部问题上的原则性的立场的话，这只会浪费时间，并且会为我们大家造成损失”。南斯拉夫领导人抱着这种“原则性的立场”，在他们的发言中把苏联共产党人以及其他国家的共产党人称为“教条主义者”、“机会主义的实际主义者”、“实用主义者”、“实际的教条主义者”等等。某些南斯拉夫发言人在对其他国家共产党的攻击中陶醉于使用各种耸人听闻的字眼和刺耳的术语。
    南共领导人的这种行动表明，他们粗暴地破坏了无产阶级国际主义的原则。他们的这种行动违反了列宁的一个极其重要的论点，这个论点就是：“无产阶级以及全世界各国和各民族的全体劳动群众如果不是自愿地力求结成联盟和团结一致，那么，战胜资本主义这个事业就不能顺利地完成”。
    在南共第七次代表大会的讲坛上，有人史无前例地妄自尊大地说什么南共领导人的行动就像……列宁为争取马克思主义原则的胜利而进行的斗争一样。这种说法简直是一种侮蔑。这种说法意味着把南斯拉夫共产党人同所谓陷入教条主义泥沼的全世界共产主义运动对立起来，把各国共产党同第二国际的社会民主党相提并论，而对这些社会民主党的机会主义列宁曾进行了无情的斗争。
    南共领导人采取不正确的立场、破坏所有马克思列宁主义政党所公认的党与党的关系的准则和无产阶级国际主义原则，这特别表现在他们不正确地对待原则性的党的批评上。他们竟粗野地指责别人干涉南斯拉夫内政，来回答对南共纲领草案的缺点和错误的同志式的批评。必须把这个重要的问题弄个一清二楚。既然南共中央把自己的纲领草案分送给所有兄弟党，那又怎么能责怪其他共产党想干涉南斯拉夫内政呢？把纲领草案分送给兄弟党是为了什么呢？显然是叫大家对南共这个纲领草案表示意见。可是当别人把这种意见谈出来了时，极不客气的攻击就开始落到兄弟党的头上。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人自以为有权利对国际工人运动作武断和傲慢的评价，说什么：“最近几十年来国际工人运动的发展不是同社会事件和物质条件的发展步调一致的。”这里实际上就是说，大家都不一致，只有我的步调是一致的！
    全世界知道，国际共产主义运动获得了多么巨大的、真正具有历史意义的胜利，各国共产党在群众中进行了多么巨大的工作。
    南共代表大会指着许多国家的共产党说：“这些党在吸引群众的斗争中不够大胆主动，它们故步自封、脱离群众，因此他们不能够在本国的社会发展中起什么决定性的作用。”但是，有谁不知道，在许多资本主义国家，例如，美国、西德、西班牙的共产党在极其残酷的警察迫害、残暴的恐怖和挑衅的环境下进行斗争。请问一问美国的共产党人，他们就会告诉你，在美国，帝国主义者过去和现在是怎样摧残共产主义运动的。所有共产党人都知道，在资本主义国家有三十多个共产党被宣布为非法。但是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人哪里还管到这一点呢？
    在南共代表大会上有人硬说，在意识形态问题上不可能有一个可以断定谁是谁非的正确无误的裁判官，而唯一的、最后的裁判官就是实践、就是历史。当然，生活的观点、社会实践的尺度应当成为确定这种或那种论点是否正确、是否真实的首要和基本的东西。归根结蒂，理论结论可以在历史上找到证实或否定。但是，难道历史没有证实马克思列宁主义的基本原理是正确的吗？难道革命斗争和社会主义建设的实践没有表明这些原理的伟大生命力吗？那么，到底为什么受过不同国家的千百万工农争取美好生活的斗争经验考验的这些马克思列宁主义原理不能成为意识形态争论当中的指路明灯、指南针和真理的尺度呢？否认这一点，就是反对马克思列宁主义原理的正确性，就是以相对虚无主义的观点对待真理问题，而对相对虚无主义来说，是没有任何固定的原则、信念和真理的。
    如果认为，在我们这一世纪，当许多国家都存在有经过很好锻炼的、拥有丰富经验的、对群众有很大影响的马克思列宁主义政党的时候，推动社会主义思想、马克思列宁主义理论前进的、能够看到正确解决共产主义运动的迫切问题的，只有某一个党，例如，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟，而所有其余的党却据说似乎被注定——用卡德尔的鄙视的话来说——“原地踏步”，那是很可笑的。
    类似南共中央委员佩罗维奇之流的其他发言者走得就更远了，他们说：“关于‘集体的马克思列宁主义观点’我们听得很多了，意思是指某些党的中枢的决议。在这方面，人们说，不能怀疑党的中枢的观点的正确性。这同马克思列宁主义没有任何联系”。然而，实际上这种对兄弟共产党的攻击才是同马克思列宁主义没有任何共同之处的。
    马克思列宁主义、社会主义思想正在发展着、前进着，被千百万为社会主义而斗争的战士的活生生的经验丰富着，被一切兄弟共产党和工人党的伟大的、多方面的活动丰富着，它们结合本国的具体特点、在新的历史条件下创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义理论。中国、法国、意大利、捷克斯洛伐克、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、阿尔巴尼亚、英国、西班牙、拉丁美洲国家、印度、印度尼西亚、芬兰和其他国家的共产党对马克思列宁主义的理论、战略和策略的发展作出巨大贡献。共产党和工人党通过的宣言是它们的集体经验的总结，这个宣言已经成为整个国际共产主义运动的重要的马克思列宁主义的纲领性文件。
    社会主义国家兄弟共产党和工人党宣言在创造性地运用和发展马克思列宁主义理论的基础上，对现时代——从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时代——作了深刻的科学分析。宣言根据苏联和其他社会主义国家的经验，证实了马克思列宁主义理论的下面这一原理和结论的正确性，这就是在社会主义革命和社会主义建设过程中，出现了许多对一切走上社会主义道路的国家共同的主要规律。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案无视宣言中的最重要的原理，并代之以违背马克思列宁主义的评价和结论。“共产党人”杂志评南共纲领草案的文章表明了，这个纲领草案窜改马克思列宁主义的基本原理。关于阶级斗争和无产阶级革命的学说，被关于资本主义和平发展成社会主义的机会主义理论所代替。马克思列宁主义政党作为劳动人民争取共产主义胜利斗争的组织者和领导者的作用被贬低。社会主义的国家在建设社会主义和共产主义中的组织作用和创造性作用被否认。
    南共纲领草案关于社会主义的国家的一切说法实质上都是要削弱社会主义国家。这对谁有利？一切社会主义国家的历史经验表明，在过渡时期条件下，在渴望资本主义复辟的帝国主义侵略阵营存在的情况下，一切想削弱社会主义的国家的作法，只是对社会主义的敌人帝国主义者有利。
    南共纲领草案歪曲地叙述了社会主义的国家及其理论思想在苏联的发展过程，企图把苏维埃国家的历史描绘成具有某种“官僚国家极权主义的倾向”，并且把必须运用社会主义国家作为建设共产主义的武器的主张，说成是“对于马克思主义的一种国家极权实用主义的修正”。大家都知道，马克思在“哥达纲领批判”中谈到过“共产主义社会的未来国家性质的问题”。列宁也说过，“要使国家完全消亡，必须有完全的共产主义”。马克思和列宁的这些天才的结论不断为各国建设社会主义的国际经验所证实。人们完全有理由要问：到底是谁在修正马克思和列宁关于国家的学说呢？
    南斯拉夫领导人反对官僚主义，但是他们把官僚主义理解成为社会主义国家中的某种“社会力量”。任何一种社会力量首先就是一种阶级力量。在社会主义的条件下，官僚主义又何从得以滋长成为“社会力量”呢？对于这一问题只可能有两种答案。或者是认为，官僚主义是旧社会的残余的遗毒，在建设社会主义的过程中经过反对官僚主义的顽强斗争，它可以顺利地被克服掉而不可能转变成为一种特别的“社会力量”，或者是像诽谤者和叛徒德热拉斯那样硬说官僚主义是出现了某种“新阶级”的结果。在这里想寻找一条中间的、第三条道路，像卡德尔所努力作的那样，是白费力气。
    在南斯拉夫领导人的言论中，经常把社会主义民主的发展同社会主义的国家的发展对立起来。他们这样做，是无视列宁主义关于社会主义的国家的发展也就是社会主义民主的发展这一指示的。
    苏维埃社会主义国家的经验、特别是最近几年的经验，为广泛发展社会主义民主树立了鲜明的榜样。在广义的发展生产方面的一些问题，这里也包括对技术发展和人才培养的关怀，在社会生活范围内所占的比重正在增长，并且将一直增长下去。这些问题将逐渐填满社会的整个最主要的活动。列宁说过：“在所有的国家机关中将只有”国民经济委员会“能保持自己巩固的位置”，而“管理机构，就这个词的原本的狭义来说，老的国家机构势必消亡，而最高的国民经济委员会型式的机构势必成长、发展和加强，填满有组织的社会的全部最主要的活动”。
    苏联共产党正在实现苏共第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，按照列宁所指示的方针发展社会主义民主，最近时期制定了并且实现了改组经济管理工作的真正宏伟的计划。苏维埃国家合乎规律的发展表现在：越来越深刻地实现民主集中制的原则，这个原则为群众的创造性积极性开辟了最广阔的场地，它同官僚主义和无政府主义都是水火不相容的。近年来我国在改组工业和建筑业管理工作、在进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站、在提高工会、共青团和其他群众社会团体的作用方面所已经实现的一些措施，标志着发展社会主义民主方面的一个重要阶段，丰富了社会主义和共产主义建设的经验，这些措施是对马克思列宁主义宝库的重大贡献。
    对整个国际共产主义运动采取什么态度，对那些在马克思列宁主义基础上总结经验和确定了争取和平、民主和社会主义任务的纲领性文件采取什么态度，在目前条件下是对每一个共产党和工人党极为重要的问题。在世界分为社会主义和资本主义两个体系、两个阵营的时代，国际共产主义运动和每一个马克思列宁主义政党的任务是要正确地看到对共同敌人帝国主义斗争的前景，加强工人阶级政党的一切力量的团结和统一，以便打退反动派的各种阴谋，巩固和发展世界社会主义体系。在这种情况下，那怕是稍微脱离马克思列宁主义的原则，流露任何特殊性和宗派主义，都不可避免地会陷于修正主义的泥坑，而一切马克思列宁主义政党都在同修正主义这种主要危险进行坚决的斗争。
    国际共产主义运动和世界社会主义阵营的伟大的不可战胜的生命力在于它们在马克思列宁主义原则基础上的团结一致。像保护眼珠一样保护这种团结一致，在共同敌人——侵略的帝国主义——面前全力加强这种团结一致，这是一切共产党和工人党的神圣职责。
    社会主义国家的共产党和工人党在它们的宣言中说：
    “同帝国主义所谓‘共产主义危机’的胡说相反，共产主义运动正在发展和巩固。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的历史性决议，不但对于苏共和苏联的共产主义建设具有伟大的意义，而且开辟了国际共产主义运动的新阶段，促进了它在马克思列宁主义基础上的进一步发展。中国、法国、意大利和其他国家共产党最近时期召开的代表大会的成功，有力地说明了它们的队伍的团结一致，说明了它们对于无产阶级国际主义原则的忠实。”
    至于苏联共产党，它忠于马克思列宁主义的旗帜，它一贯为社会主义阵营和全世界共产主义运动的进一步团结而斗争。
    各国共产党和工人党为反对修正主义和教条主义而进行不调和的斗争，维护马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性，团结自己的队伍，并且在这个基础上团结世界各国的工人阶级和劳动人民，它们不断克服前进道路上的一切障碍，在为和平、民主和社会主义而斗争的事业中获得日新月异的胜利。（新华社据塔斯社莫斯科9日电）
