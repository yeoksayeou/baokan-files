　　Talking About "Health"
　　Fu Lianzhang

    Life is only once, and life is humanity's most precious asset. The brevity of life is a significant loss to humanity in terms of developing culture, science, and building their own countries. It takes about twenty years for a person to fully develop in all aspects, and then they are tempered in labor and work. Just when they are gradually maturing politically, professionally, and in their work ability, and are ready to do more for the people, the decline of old age becomes an obstacle to their work. For this reason, scholars in various countries have conducted considerable research on the issue of human lifespan. Scholars believe that the lifespan of animals has a certain relationship with their growth period, with the lifespan being about five to six times the growth period. For example, a cat's growth period is one and a half years, and it can live to be eight years old; a dog takes four years to mature, and it can live to be twenty years old; while humans take twenty-five years to mature. Therefore, the human lifespan should be around one hundred and twenty-five to one hundred and fifty years. So, if one doesn't get sick (or gets sick less often) and doesn't age prematurely, according to the laws of human development, living to the age that humans are capable of reaching, human lifespan should be longer than the "rare old age" of seventy. This is the theory, and there are many examples that can prove it in practice. According to the data from China's 1953 national population census, there were more than 3,380 centenarians across the country, and these centenarians generally had no special differences in their living conditions compared to ordinary people. Similarly, in the Soviet Union in 1953, there were more than 30,000 centenarians. These centenarians were not only long-lived but also healthy and had a certain ability to work. From this, we can see that humanity has not yet obtained the lifespan that nature has endowed us with. We should protect our health and strive to live longer for socialist construction.
    History tells us that the system of people exploiting people has always been an important reason for depriving people of the joy of life and shortening their lifespan. In these societies, the life of hunger and cold and the prevalence of infectious diseases massively strangle human life.
    Whether theoretically or practically, it has been proven that humans are far from living to the natural limits of life. But how can we make human lifespan longer? This requires humans to incorporate their lives into lifestyles that conform to the laws of human development, that is to say, people must pay attention to hygiene in order to obtain health and longevity.
    I have profound experience with this. Many people know that more than thirty years ago, I was a severe tuberculosis patient, and I was bedridden for two years due to tuberculosis. I had fever, hemoptysis, emaciation, and weakness. Many people thought I wouldn't live long, and I myself thought so at the time. But as a result, I am still alive. Not only was I able to survive, but I also participated in the 25,000-li Long March, crossed snow-capped mountains and grasslands, and am still living healthily today. This year I am already sixty-four years old, but I can still persist in working for the Party. From my experience, there are two main reasons for gaining health: first, resolutely taking the revolutionary road and establishing a revolutionary optimistic spirit; second, resolutely paying attention to hygiene, even during the Long March, I never interrupted it.
    Since I joined the revolution in 1927, the liberation of my thinking was a starting point for the improvement of my health. In the past, I was an individualistic freelance professional, running around busily all day long. Although it was for the sake of hygiene and to serve society, it was basically out of narrow personal views and status concepts. I was often anxious about gains and losses in my work, and often bothered myself with trivial matters, with many ideological burdens. Since accepting revolutionary ideas, criticizing my petty-bourgeois old views, and seeing the great future of communism, my vision broadened, my thinking expanded, and I abandoned all personal material and ideological burdens and joined the revolution. I established an optimistic spirit towards society and my personal health. Based on this, I insisted on paying attention to hygiene, combined with appropriate medical treatment, and from then on, I regained my health. Here, I would like to focus on some of my experiences in adhering to hygienic habits for decades.

    1. Dietary Hygiene
    Speaking of dietary hygiene, it involves the issue of nutrition. Generally speaking, human needs include protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, salt, and water. Protein is naturally most abundant in meat, but beans, potatoes, grains, rice, wheat, and the like also contain large amounts of plant protein, which also has significant nutritional value for the human body. Fat exists in animal and vegetable oils. In rice, flour, and vegetables, the main component is carbohydrates. Vitamins and salts are present in various foods. Therefore, it is not necessary to obtain the nutrients essential for the human body only from meat, eggs, and milk. For example, Comrade Xu Teli has always been a vegetarian, and is now more than eighty years old, but his body is still very good and he can continue to work for the Party.
    We should pay attention to the following points in our diet:

    1. Slow Eating and Fine Chewing
      "Sickness enters through the mouth" is a well-known proverb, and bad diets or eating habits do bring a lot of pain to people. The oral cavity is the first checkpoint for food entering the human body, and it is the beginning of digestion and absorption of food. "Slow eating and fine chewing" can fully exert the mechanical action of teeth and the chemical action of saliva in the oral cavity, which is more conducive to digestion and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. At the same time, chewing movement also affects the movement and secretion function of the stomach, and affects blood circulation and muscle work capacity. Chewing is not an isolated, local movement, but an organic part of the entire human digestion and absorption. If you swallow without chewing fully when eating, and do not make full use of the function of the oral cavity, it will increase the workload of the gastrointestinal tract and may cause some gastrointestinal diseases.
    2. Regular Time and Quantity
    After food enters the stomach from the oral cavity, it needs to stay in the stomach for a certain period of time for digestion, which is about two to six hours. If there are no regular eating habits, and one only "eats when one wants to eat," then the stomach will store a large amount of food all day long, keeping the stomach in a working state all day without time to rest. Over time, it will affect the digestive function of the stomach, and further cause gastrointestinal diseases. Excessive diet often causes people to feel heavy in the abdomen and sleepy, thus reducing the working ability of the brain, and it will cause the body to spend a lot of heat in the digestive process and absorption process, resulting in poor food digestion and inability to be fully absorbed. Some people also believe that continuous long-term overeating can shorten human lifespan. Many scholars believe that premature aging and many diseases such as arteriosclerosis, cholecystitis, gallstones, diabetes, and obesity are often related to overeating. This has a greater impact on people with less physical activity. Therefore, we should try to eat a fixed amount of food at the same time every day. This can train the regularity of the body's functions, make it accustomed to the rhythm, maintain the conditioned reflexes that have been developed, and it is also easy to maintain a good appetite and absorption capacity. The daily food only needs to have reasonable nutrition and contain enough heat energy, and should not be too rich, so that our gastrointestinal system is always in a regular and normal functional state.
    3. Brush Your Teeth in the Morning and Evening, Rinse Your Mouth After Meals
    Most people can brush their teeth in the morning and evening, but many people find it troublesome to rinse their mouths after meals. Rinsing your mouth after meals is of great significance to our oral hygiene. Because after we eat, food residues often remain in the gaps between the teeth. If we do not remove them in time, they will corrode our teeth. If our teeth are damaged, it will have a great impact on our human health. First of all, it has a great impact on people's diet and spirit, and directly affects work. Moreover, bad teeth will also act as a focus of infection in the oral cavity, constantly inputting bacteria into the body, which is even more harmful. "Brushing teeth" and "rinsing mouth" are just a matter of lifting a hand, it is unreasonable to find it troublesome.

    2. Sleep and Rest
    People's daily work generally includes physical labor and mental labor, and even during physical labor, the work of the brain is never interrupted. Therefore, how to pay attention to the hygiene of the brain and protect the health of the brain is very important.
    Human thinking, memory, attention, and the physiological processes of controlling muscle work must be completed through the reflection function of the cerebral cortex. The normal activity of the cerebral cortex is realized under the interaction of indispensable and continuous excitation and inhibition processes. The excitation and inhibition process is two aspects of a holistic activity process, and its function is to adjust the stimuli from various receptors inside and outside the body, so that the various parts of the body are appropriately reacted, in order to achieve the unity of the internal environment and the unity of the internal environment and the external environment. According to Pavlov's explanation, the cells of the cerebral cortex are the guard points of the biological organism and have a high degree of reactivity. The inhibition caused by the consumption of cortical cells has a protective effect, preventing the damage caused by continued consumption, and at the same time, through assimilation, accumulating "fuel" to restore their own normal functions. Therefore, Pavlov believes that this inhibition is a special protective function, and sleep has such a meaning.
    This inhibitory process that occurs in the cerebral cortex does not only stay in a limited part, but can be diffused in the cerebral cortex. If conditions are created for the widespread and prolonged diffusion of inhibition in the cerebral cortex, then the cerebral cortex will not sense most of the stimuli acting on it, and will no longer affect the striated muscles, which becomes sleep. During sleep, all life functions of the body slow down, breathing and metabolism slow down; assimilation is stronger than dissimilation; heart activity slows down and weakens; blood pressure decreases; body temperature decreases slightly. The functions of the whole body are in a state of rest and recovery. Therefore, it is not difficult to understand that sleep is an important means for us to protect the function of the brain, so that it always maintains vigorous energy, and it is also an important factor for us to eliminate fatigue and protect health. Therefore, some people say that sleep is as indispensable to people as air and nutrition.
    Based on the above reasons, many scholars have conducted research on sleep. The Soviet Union has successfully established sleep therapy. Through artificial sleep, the working ability of cortical cells can be restored, and the cerebral cortex mechanism can be mobilized to eliminate diseases. Last year, Soviet scientist Professor S. Braines discovered that a large amount of sleep can treat premature aging. He cited an example: animals can endure hunger for up to thirty days, but lack of sleep can kill them within ten days.
    How much sleep time is appropriate for us every day? This varies with age. Generally speaking, eight hours of sleep a day is suitable for adults. In particular, people engaged in mental work should have sufficient sleep. Perhaps some people will say that we are currently in a high tide of socialist construction, and people are working day and night, so proposing to ensure sufficient sleep is not realistic. Yes, we are in a high tide of great leap forward in all aspects today, and socialist construction needs our endless energy and enthusiasm. As a revolutionary cadre, my heart resonates with these comrades. But as a medical worker, I also have a responsibility to remind everyone that we should use our energy more rationally and fully, because socialist construction is a long-term thing, so we should consider "resting reasonably and working better."
    Long-term lack of sleep will have a great impact on our health. The first is excessive fatigue and exhaustion of the nervous system, low mental work efficiency, declining memory and understanding, and often causing dizziness and headache, which seriously affects work. And finally not only the nervous system, but even the heart, blood vessels, and digestive organs will be harmed by lack of sleep. Some people even develop insomnia. After we understand the rules of the function of the cerebral cortex, then we can believe that arranging life reasonably will relieve us of this pain. From my experience, we can pay attention to two points:
    1. Establish a regular schedule, make life regular, and strive to sleep at the same time every day, so that sleep gradually forms a conditioned reflex in time. Do not read before going to bed, do not think about work; do not eat dinner too late, and do not overeat; do not eat snacks after meals, so as to avoid a large amount of food still accumulating in the stomach during sleep, affecting sleep. Or take a walk before going to bed, and soaking your feet in hot water can also help.
    2. For those who are engaged in mental labor, work is stressful, and they often suffer from insomnia, it is also necessary to use sleeping pills appropriately. The so-called appropriate means not to use them indiscriminately, and to have the guidance of a doctor. The most important thing is to develop regular living habits.
    In addition to normal sleep at night, there is also rest after lunch during the day. I think that if conditions permit, taking a nap for half an hour to an hour after lunch during the day is also very beneficial; even if you can't fall asleep, it doesn't matter, lying quietly on the bed to relax the whole body muscles is very beneficial.
    Although sleep is a very important way of rest, it is not the only way of rest. Our life should be more colorful, so there should be a variety of activities in life. Because the conversion of mental labor and physical labor, the conversion of work and study and cultural entertainment can make the brain get the effect of alternate rest. Therefore, we must be good at arranging our lives, so that it has learning, labor, thinking, and entertainment, and it is vigorous, diverse, and pleasant.

    3. More Outdoor Life, More Physical Labor
    Outdoor life means air, sunshine, water, and muscle activity. A person can live for a period of time without food, but without oxygen, he cannot live for even ten minutes. Human muscle activity cannot be separated from oxygen for a moment, and the nervous system activity requires a lot of oxygen first. The oxygen consumed by the brain tissue is more than the oxygen consumed by working muscles, which shows the importance of fresh air for protecting the health of the brain. When a person is in a static state, the ventilation volume is six to eight liters per minute, but during work, especially physical work, it can reach more than one hundred liters. In less than a minute, all the blood in the human body can flow through the lungs and obtain the oxygen needed by the body (about 250 ml of oxygen is required per minute at rest, and it can be more than ten times higher during exercise), and at the same time, it releases about the same amount of carbon dioxide. In our daily work indoors, due to the sedentary lifestyle with little activity, we have become accustomed to shallow and insufficient breathing. Insufficient external respiration leads to insufficient respiration of internal tissues, which will produce adverse effects such as dizziness and reduced thinking ability. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to advocate work break exercises, but the important thing is to spend more time outdoors.
    Medicine has long used fresh and clean air as a means of treatment. Aerotherapy is a precious medicine given to us by nature, especially for patients with tuberculosis.
    Sunlight and water are also means given to us by nature to protect our health. Appropriate sunlight exposure is not only meaningful for promoting the health of our skin, but also provides us with vitamins. Vitamin D is one of the vitamins indispensable to our human body. Children lacking vitamin D will suffer from rickets. The skin of the human body contains a certain amount of vitamin D precursor, which is converted into vitamins under the irradiation of sunlight, so appropriate exposure to sunlight can prevent the lack of vitamin D.
    Water also plays a great role in exercising the body, which can enhance the nervous system, promote blood circulation and breathing, strengthen metabolism, and make the whole body strong and powerful. It can also improve the resistance of the skin and prevent colds. There are many ways to use water, such as shower, bath, rub bath, sea bath, etc., and the temperature of the water can also be divided into cold, warm, and hot. For older and weaker people, rub bath can also make the muscles active and have the effect of exercise. People with good physical conditions can also consider using warm or cold water, or taking sea baths and swimming.
    Physical labor can enhance the ability of the cerebral cortex to analyze and judge stimuli, strengthen the control ability of the cerebral cortex over muscles and various internal organs, and can also promote blood circulation in the body and promote the body's metabolism. Therefore, the central government's policy of participating in physical labor is not only of great significance to strengthening the industrial and agricultural production front and to the ideological transformation of intellectuals, but also a very wise measure in terms of promoting physical health and enhancing physical fitness. Intellectuals have always lived mostly in cities, and they are basically engaged in indoor mental labor, with insufficient outdoor life and physical labor. Therefore, they also suffer from some diseases that are adapted to their living and working characteristics, such as insomnia, neurasthenia, and indigestion. Rural life is full of labor life, and you can contact fresh air and sufficient sunshine. Physical activities can better promote the body to get full exercise. In this way, we can adjust our urban life, which is mainly indoor and mental labor, and make the various organs of the human body get the opportunity of alternate rest. Facts have proved that because farmers spend most of their time living outdoors and doing physical labor, their bodies are generally healthier than ours. For example, Comrade Xu Teli has always loved physical labor. When he was on the Long March, he was almost sixty years old. The organization took care of him and gave him a horse to ride, but he didn't want it. He just walked. Now he is more than eighty years old, and he often walks instead of riding, and his body is still very strong. This shows the important significance of physical labor to our human health.

    Paying attention to personal hygiene and enhancing physical fitness are important conditions for striving for health, and also an active way. Eliminating infectious diseases and eliminating all infectious vectors are equally important tasks. Our Party has always attached importance to this work. In hygiene work, we have always followed the policy of prevention first, and the measures now proposed to eliminate the four pests and pay attention to hygiene are major measures for us to protect people's health.
    Health can be obtained, and human lifespan can be extended! For thousands of years, people have been constantly exploring the secrets of prolonging life and youth. The ancient Greeks Hippocrates and Aristotle thought about this issue, but they all failed. Only today, with the progress of medical science knowledge, in our socialist system of the country, we have obtained the possibility of solving health and longevity. Bakulev, the president of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences, once predicted that the second half of the twentieth century will enable mankind to get rid of the pain of cancer and other malignant tumors, mankind can destroy all natural breeding grounds for diseases, hygiene is human medicine, and people will also "prolong life."

　　谈“健康”
　　傅连暲
    人的生命只有一次，生命是人类最宝贵的财富。寿命的短暂，对人类在发展文化、科学以及建设自己的国家等方面来说，是一个不小的损失。一个人各方面的长成总要二十来年，接着就在劳动、工作中锻炼，当他在政治上、业务上和工作能力上逐步走向成熟，正好为人民多做些事情的时候，而暮年的衰老却又成了他们工作的障碍了。为此，各国学者对人类的寿命问题，都进行了不少的研究工作。学者们认为，动物的生命期与生长期有一定的关系，生命期约为生长期的五到六倍。例如，猫的生长期为一年半，它的寿命能活到八年；狗要四年长成，它能活二十年；而人要到二十五岁才发育成熟，因此人的寿命应该是一百二十五到一百五十岁左右。所以如果不生病（或少生病）、不早衰，按照人体的发展规律，活到人可以活到的岁数，人类的寿命是应该比“古来稀”的七十长寿更多的。理论上是如此，实际上也有不少例子可以证明。根据我国1953年全国人口调查的资料，全国共有百岁以上的老人三千三百八十多人，而这些百岁老人在生活条件上一般都与常人没有什么特殊的区别。又如苏联1953年全国有百岁老人三万多人，这些百岁老人不仅长寿，而且身体健康，有一定的工作能力。从这里可以看到，人类还没有从自然赋与中取得应有的寿命，我们应该保护健康，争取为社会主义建设而活得更久。
    历史告诉我们，人剥削人的制度，从来就是剥夺人们生命的欢乐和缩短人们寿命的一个重要原因。在这些社会中，饥寒交迫的生活和传染病的流行大量地扼杀了人类的生命。
    无论理论上或实际上都证明了人类还远没有活到生命的自然界限，但是怎样才能使人类的寿命长呢？这就需要人类将自己的生活纳入符合于人体发展的规律的生活方式之中，也就是说人必须讲究卫生，才能获得健康和长寿。
    关于这一点，我自己有着深刻的体会。许多人都知道，三十多年以前我曾经是一个严重的肺结核患者，曾经因肺结核病卧床两年，发热、咯血、消瘦无力，许多人都认为我活不久了，我自己当时也曾经这样想。但结果我仍活着，不但能活下来，而且还参加了二万五千里长征，踏过了雪山、草地，而且还健康地活到今天。今年我已经六十四岁了，但我仍能坚持地为党工作。从我的经验来说，获得健康的原因主要有两条：第一、是坚决走革命的道路，建立了革命的乐观主义精神。第二、是坚决地讲卫生，即使在长征途中也从不间断。
    我自1927年参加革命以后，由于思想上获得了解放，是我身体好转的一个起点。过去我是一个个人主义的自由职业者，整天地奔波劳碌，虽说是为了卫生事业，为了服务社会，但基本上还是出于狭隘的个人观点和地位观念，工作中患得患失，经常为琐碎事情而自寻烦恼，思想包袱很多。自从接受了革命的思想，批判了自己的小资产阶级的旧观点，看到了共产主义的伟大前途，自己的眼光扩大了，思想开展了，抛弃了一切个人的物质上思想上的包袱，参加了革命。对社会对个人身体都建立了乐观主义的精神，在这个基础上坚持讲究卫生，结合适当的医疗，从此我重新获得了健康。这里，我想着重谈谈几十年来我坚持卫生习惯的一些体会。
    一、饮食卫生
    说到饮食卫生，就涉及到营养问题。一般来说，人体的需要有蛋白质、脂肪、碳水化合物、维生素、盐及水等。蛋白质自然以肉类最丰富，但在豆类、马铃薯、谷类、米麦等类中也含有多量的植物蛋白质，对人体同样有重大的营养价值。脂肪则存在于动物油和植物油中。在米、面、蔬菜里面，主要的成份是醣类。维生素和盐类则存在于各种食物中。因此不一定要从肉类、蛋类、奶类中才可以取得必需的人体的营养。例如，徐特立同志一向以素食为主，今年已经八十多岁了，但身体仍然很好，能够继续为党工作。
    饮食中应该注意这样几点：
    1．慢吃细嚼
      “病从口入”是大家都知道的一句成语，不良的饮食或进食习惯的确给人们带来不少的痛苦。口腔是食物进入人体的第一关，而且是人体消化、吸收食物的开始。“慢吃细嚼”可以充分发挥口腔内牙齿的机械作用和唾液的化学作用，更有利于胃肠道的消化吸收。同时咀嚼运动还影响胃的运动和分泌机能，并影响血液循环和肌肉的工作能力。咀嚼并不是孤立的、局部的运动，而是整个人体消化吸收的一个有机部分。如果在进食时没有充分的咀嚼就吞咽，没有充分利用口腔的功能，就会加重胃肠道的工作负担，可能引起一些胃肠疾病。
    2．定时定量
    食物从口腔进入胃以后，在胃里要有一定时间的停留，以进行消化，这段时间大约是二到六小时。如果没有规律的饮食习惯，只凭个人“想吃就吃”，那么，胃内整天都存储有较多量的食物，使胃整天处于工作状态而没有休息的时间，日子久了，就会影响胃的消化功能，进一步就会造成肠胃病。过量的饮食，常会使人引起腹内沉重的感觉和困倦，因而使脑的工作能力降低，而且会使身体花费大量热力于消化过程和吸收过程，结果是食物消化不好，不能充分吸收。还有人认为连续长期的过食能使人的寿命缩短。许多学者认为未老先衰以及许多病症如动脉粥样硬化、胆囊炎、胆石、糖尿病和肥胖症等，常常都与过食有关。这对于体力活动少的人影响更大。所以我们应尽可能每天在同一的时间内吃定量的食物。这样可以训练身体机体的规律性，使之习惯于节奏，保持已养成的条件反射，这样也容易保持良好的食欲和吸收力。每日的食物只要有合理的营养及含有足够的热能即可，不应过分丰盛，使我们的胃肠系统经常处于规律的、正常的功能状态之下。
    3．早晚刷牙，饭后漱口
    早晚刷牙，多数人能做到的，但饭后漱口就有不少人嫌麻烦。饭后漱口，对于我们的口腔卫生有很大的意义。因为我们进食后常有食物残渣遗留于牙齿间隙中，如不及时把它除去，就会腐蚀我们的牙齿，牙齿坏了，对我们人体健康的影响是很大的。首先对人的饮食、精神均影响很大，也直接地影响了工作，而且坏牙还会作为一个病灶在口腔内不断向体内输入病菌，为害就更大了。“刷牙”“漱口”只是举手之劳，嫌它麻烦是说不过去的。
    二、睡眠与休息
    人们日常的工作总的来说包括了体力劳动和脑力劳动，而且即使在体力劳动时，大脑的工作也从未间断，因此如何注意脑的卫生，保护大脑的健康是十分重要的。
    人类的思维、记忆、注意及支配肌肉工作等生理过程，都必须通过大脑皮层的反射功能去完成。而大脑皮层的正常活动，是在必不可少的、从不停息的兴奋与抑制过程的相互作用下实现的。兴奋与抑制过程是一个整体活动过程的两个方面，其作用是把来自体内外各种感受器传来的刺激加以调整，使身体各部加以适当反应，以达到体内环境统一及体内环境与体外环境统一的地步。而大脑皮层的细胞按照巴甫洛夫的解释，是生物机体的警卫点，具有高度的反应性。皮层细胞因消耗所发生的抑制是具有保护性作用的，防止继续消耗所产生的损害，同时借着同化作用，积累“燃料”，以恢复他们自己的正常机能。所以巴甫洛夫认为这种抑制是一种特殊的保护性机能，而睡眠就具有这样的意义。
    发生在大脑皮层内的这种抑制过程，并不仅仅停留在一局限的部位上，而是可以在大脑皮层内扩散开来。如果造成了抑制在大脑皮层内广泛和长时间的扩散的条件，则大脑皮层将不感受外界作用于它的多数刺激，并且不再影响于横纹肌，这就成为睡眠。大脑在睡眠的期间，身体的一切生命机能均缓慢了，呼吸和新陈代谢减慢；同化作用强于异化作用；心脏活动减慢和变弱；血压降低；体温略降低。整个人体的机能处于休息和恢复的状态中。所以不难明白，睡眠是我们保护大脑机能，使它经常保持旺盛精力的重要手段，也是我们消除疲劳、保护健康的重要因素。所以有人说，睡眠对于人是和空气和营养一样不可缺少的。
    基于以上的道理，不少学者对睡眠进行了研究，苏联成功的建立了睡眠疗法，通过人工的睡眠可以恢复皮层细胞的工作能力，并且动员大脑皮层机构消除疾病。去年苏联的科学家斯·布莱恩斯教授发现通过大量睡眠可以治疗未老先衰。他举例说：动物可以忍受饥饿多至三十天，但是缺少睡眠却能使它们在十天内死亡。
    我们每天要有多少睡眠时间才合适呢？这要随年龄而有所不同，一般说来成年人每天睡眠八小时是适宜的。特别是从事脑力劳动的人们更应有充分的睡眠。也许有人会说，目前我们正在社会主义建设高潮，人们夜以继日地工作，提出保证充分睡眠是不切合实际的。是的，我们今天各方面都处于大跃进的高潮中，社会主义建设需要我们无穷无尽的精力与热情，作为一个革命干部，我内心与这些同志有所共鸣。但作为一个医务工作者，我也有责任提醒大家，应该更合理、更充分地来使用我们的精力，因为社会主义建设是长期的事情，所以应该考虑到“合理地休息，更好地工作”。
    长期的睡眠不足，会使我们的健康受到很大影响，首先是神经系统的过度疲劳、衰竭，脑力工作效率低，记忆力理解力衰退，经常引起头昏脑胀，严重地影响工作，而且最后不仅神经系统，就连心脏、血管、消化器官也都要受到睡眠不足的害处，有的人甚至造成失眠症。我们明白了大脑皮层机能的规律以后，那我们就可以相信，合理安排生活，是会给我们解除这一痛苦的。从我的体会来说可以注意两条：
    1．定时作息，使生活过得规律，争取每天在同一时间睡眠，使睡眠逐步在时间上形成条件反射。睡前不看书，不考虑工作；晚饭不要吃得太晚，亦不要过饱；饭后不进零食，以免睡眠时胃内仍有多量食物储积，影响入睡。或者睡前散散步，用热水泡脚也有一些帮助。
    2．从事脑力劳动，工作紧张，以致经常失眠的，必要时也可适当的使用安眠药。所谓适当，就是不要乱用，要有医师的指导。最主要还是应养成规律的生活习惯。
    除了晚上正常的睡眠以外，还有日间午饭后的休息。我认为如果在条件许可的情况下，日间午饭后午睡半小时至一小时，也是很有益处的；即使是睡不着也不要紧，静卧在床上休息这段时间使全身肌肉放松，好处很大。
    睡眠虽是极重要的休息方式，但不是休息的唯一方式。我们的生活应当更丰富多采，所以在生活中还应该有多种多样的活动。因为脑力劳动和体力劳动的转换，工作学习和文化娱乐的转换，可以使大脑得到轮换休息的效果。所以，要善于安排我们的生活，使它有学习、有劳动、有思考、有娱乐，而且是朝气蓬勃的、多样的、愉快的。
    三、多过户外生活，多做体力劳动
    户外生活，就是意味着空气、阳光、水与肌肉活动。不进食物一个人还能活一段时期，但是缺乏了氧气，则连十分钟也活不成。人的肌体活动，一刻也不能脱离氧，首先就是神经系统活动需要大量的氧。大脑组织所消耗的氧，比较工作着肌肉所消耗的氧更多，这就说明了新鲜的空气对于保护脑的健康的重要意义了。人在静止状态时换气量是每分钟六至八公升，但在工作时，尤其是体力工作时可以达到一百多公升。不到一分钟，人体全部血液即可流经肺脏并获得身体所需要的氧（静止时每分钟需氧约二百五十毫升，运动时可到十倍以上），同时放出约等量的二氧化碳。日常我们在室内的工作，由于少活动静坐的生活方式，我们已习惯于浅而不足的呼吸，外呼吸不足致使内部组织的呼吸也不足，那就会产生不良的影响，如头昏、思考力减低等。所以我们提倡工间操是有道理的，但重要的还是多过户外生活。
    医学早已利用新鲜而干净的空气作为治疗手段，大气疗法，就是自然赋与我们的宝贵的医药，对于结核病患者来说，尤为重要。
    阳光和水，也是自然界赋与我们保护健康的手段，适当的阳光照射，不但对促进我们的皮肤健康有意义，而且还供给我们以维生素。丁种维生素是我们人体不可缺少的维生素之一，缺乏丁种维生素的儿童会患佝偻病。人体的皮肤上含有一定量的丁种维生素原，丁种维生素原在阳光的照射下转变成为维生素，所以适当地照射阳光，可以防止丁种维生素的缺乏。
    水在锻炼身体上的作用也是很大的，可以增强神经系统，增进血液循环和呼吸，加强新陈代谢，使全身坚强有力。也可使皮肤的抵抗力提高，防止感冒。使用水的方法有多种，如淋浴、沐浴、擦浴、海水浴等等，水的温度也可以分为冷的、温的、热的。对于年纪较大身体较弱的人，擦浴还可以使肌肉活动，并有运动的作用。身体条件好的，还可以考虑利用温水或冷水，或进行海水浴和游泳。
    体力劳动能增进大脑皮层对刺激的分析判断能力，加强大脑皮层对肌肉和各内脏器官的控制能力，而且还能够促进体内血液循环，促进全身的新陈代谢。因此，中央提出参加体力劳动的政策，不但对加强工农业生产战线和对知识分子的思想改造有极重要的意义，就是对促进身体健康，增强体质方面来说也是十分英明的一项措施。知识分子一向多生活在城市中，而且基本上也是从事室内的脑力劳动，户外生活及体力劳动非常不够。因而也得了一些与其生活和工作特点相适应的疾病，如失眠、神经衰弱和消化不良等。农村的生活是充满了劳动的生活，可以接触新鲜的空气、充分的阳光。体力上的活动更能促使肌体得到充分的锻炼。这样就可以调剂我们在城市生活中以室内为主，以脑力劳动为主的活动方式，也就使人体各器官取得轮换休息的机会。事实证明，由于农民大部分的时间都是在户外生活和进行体力劳动，所以他们的身体一般比我们健康。又如徐特立同志，一向是爱好体力劳动的，他在长征时，已快六十岁了，组织上照顾他给他马骑，他也不要，就是步行，现在他已八十多岁了，还是常常安步当车，身体还是十分健壮，这就说明，体力劳动对我们人体健康的重要意义。
    讲究个人卫生，增强体质是争取健康的重要条件，而且也是积极的办法。消灭传染病，消灭一切传染媒介物同样也是十分重要的工作。我们党从来就是重视这一工作的，在卫生工作上，我们一向遵循着预防为主的方针，而现在提出的除四害讲卫生的措施，更是我们保护人民健康的重大措施。
    健康是可以获得的，人类的寿命是可以延长的！千百年来人们就曾不断地在探索延长寿命和青春的秘密。古希腊的希坡克拉提与亚里士多德思索过这个问题，结果他们都落空了。只有在今天，在医学科学知识的进展下，在我们社会主义制度的国家里，才获得了解决健康长寿的可能，苏联医学科学院院长巴库列夫曾预言二十世纪后半叶将使人类摆脱癌症和其他恶性瘤的病痛，人类可以毁灭所有疾病的自然温床，卫生就是人类的药物，人们也将“延年益寿”。
