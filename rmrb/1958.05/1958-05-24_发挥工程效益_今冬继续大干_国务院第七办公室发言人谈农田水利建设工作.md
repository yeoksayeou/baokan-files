To Give Play to the Benefits of Projects; Continue to Work Hard This Winter
Spokesperson of the Seventh Office of the State Council Discusses Farmland Water Conservancy Construction

(Reported by this newspaper) The upsurge in farmland water conservancy construction last winter and this spring has come to an end. A spokesperson for the Seventh Office of the State Council made the following written statement regarding this water conservancy construction upsurge and future water conservancy construction work:

Water Conservancy Construction Takes the Lead

In the nationwide advance towards nature last winter and this spring, farmland water conservancy construction took the lead and achieved a great victory. This water conservancy construction upsurge was a revolution in the history of water conservancy construction in our country, and a revolution in which our peasants, after the great socialist revolution in economy, politics and ideology, and after the great liberation of social productive forces, transformed themselves from slaves dominated by nature to masters dominating nature. This revolution is no longer a piecemeal, fragmented struggle against natural disasters, but a fundamental change in the face of nature—eliminating ordinary waterlogging and drought disasters, realizing water conservancy, and ensuring a great leap forward in agricultural production. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the nation's peasants demonstrated the indomitable spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved the Mountains and endless wisdom, changing the face of nature with unimaginable strength and speed. In the arid and barren Gansu region, irrigation area was expanded by more than ten million mu in one winter and spring, and soil and water conservation projects were completed over 24,000 square kilometers. The drought threat that has existed since ancient times is about to become a thing of the past. Hebei, on the basis of vigorously developing water conservancy, overcame the drought of nearly 300 days without rain and basically completed the spring sowing tasks on time. Henan worked hard for a winter and spring, increasing the province's irrigation area to 87 percent of the cultivated land area, basically realizing water conservancy. Anhui completed more than 5 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work in one winter and spring, far exceeding the total amount of earth and stone work in the Huai River management project over the past eight years. In the short 200-day period from October last year to the end of April this year, the country expanded irrigation area by 350 million mu, improved irrigation area by 140 million mu, treated waterlogged area of over 200 million mu, and initially controlled soil and water conservation area of 160,000 square kilometers, completing a total of 25 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work. During the upsurge, peasants in many places put forward heroic slogans such as "Work hard in the winter, fight hard in the spring, and realize water conservancy," "Ask the mountains for land, ask the water for grain," and "A few years of hard work, ten thousand years of happiness." They turned winter leisure into winter busy, "thinking does not freeze, land does not freeze," and persisted in construction in the severe cold of minus 30 degrees Celsius. They gritted their teeth and worked hard, saved money on food and clothing, squeezed out funds, and vigorously developed water conservancy. They overcame all difficulties and broke through all conventions, creating various systematic water conservancy projects from mountainous areas to hills to plains to low-lying areas. In their advance towards nature, they not only fought with strength, but also were good at fighting with wisdom. As the scale of projects expanded and the amount of labor increased, they created thousands of ways to improve work efficiency. What is particularly valuable is that in water conservancy construction, they broke the narrow-minded concept of only caring about their own hometown that had been passed down for thousands of years, and cared for and supported each other. For example, Yuxian County in Henan called on the people in the plains to support the mountainous areas, and more than 60,000 people automatically signed up. The farmers in each county of Hebei supported each other up to 1.3 million people. Our peasants have not only given the bourgeois rightists a resounding slap in the face with the great victory of water conservancy construction, but will also use the heroism and communist spirit shown in the water conservancy construction upsurge to promote the socialist construction of our country's rural areas to a new upsurge in a faster, better and more economical way.

How to Give Play to the Benefits of Projects

The vast majority of the 350 million mu of irrigation projects built last winter and this spring were built very well. More than 60% of them have already produced benefits, and 30%-40% of the projects cannot produce benefits immediately. The main reasons are that there was little rain last winter and this spring, and the water source was insufficient, so some projects were unable to store water. Some projects were originally planned to store water only when the flood season arrived. In some places, due to the planting of wheat and other summer crops or insufficient labor, the land has not been leveled and cannot be irrigated in time. In some places, due to the lack of water lifting tools, the benefits of existing projects cannot be realized for a while. Among these projects that cannot produce benefits immediately, only a very small number are of poor quality and need to be improved before they can be effective. In the large-scale water conservancy construction movement, it is not surprising that a small number of projects have poor quality. This happens now and will happen in the future. This is a normal phenomenon. The problem is that the leadership must have a clear mind, analyze and study these poor-quality projects, find out the reasons, and improve them. We believe that in the mass competition movement to compare work enthusiasm and actual results, these poor-quality projects will be quickly improved.

In order to give full play to the benefits of existing projects, according to the existing experience of various places, the following measures should be taken: First, seize the work of storing water, diverting water, and conserving water after rain, and intercept runoff through various water diversion and storage projects to prevent water from running off. Second, vigorously tap self-flowing springs, intercept subsurface flow in dry rivers, give full play to the potential of groundwater, and combine canal irrigation with well irrigation as much as possible for double insurance. Third, strengthen irrigation management and save water. Fourth, combine spring sowing and summer planting, or use the agricultural production interval to actively level the land. In addition, to solve the difficulty of insufficient water lifting tools, we should mainly rely on the masses. The industrial sector has done its best, and various places cannot wait for the state to supply water lifting machinery. We should continue to vigorously promote and popularize various improved water lifting tools, reward mass inventions and creations, and fully tap the potential of existing pumping machinery. At present, an irrigation technology innovation movement is emerging in various places. We should seize the opportunity to sum up experience, train cadres, and impart technology to enable the movement to develop rapidly.

In addition to giving full play to the benefits of existing water conservancy projects, we should also pay attention to the following tasks in water conservancy construction:

New Problems Must Be Solved in Time

First, make preparations for flood prevention. The flood season is approaching, and we should make preparations half a month in advance according to the arrival time of the flood season in various places. First of all, we must pay attention to preventing麻痹 (paralysis) and carelessness. It is wrong to think that this year's soil and water conservation projects will allow us to relax flood prevention efforts. This year, we must not only prevent floods at points and along lines, but also on a broad scale. We must be fully prepared ideologically. Secondly, we must conduct an inspection of flood prevention equipment and materials, promptly plug loopholes, and be fully prepared. Thirdly, unfinished reservoir projects should be completed before the flood season. Completed projects should be inspected to prevent accidents. The destruction of five small reservoirs (four of which were under construction) on the Mangniu River in Cixian County, Hebei, in a heavy rain on April 23, and the breaching of the embankment of the Dongwushi medium-sized reservoir should draw the attention of various places.

Second, do a good job in the observation and testing of projects. After various projects were built on a large scale last winter and this spring, many new problems have been raised for us. For example, among various water conservancy projects, which are the most effective and should continue to be developed? Which are not yet perfect and should be improved? Which have little effect and should be improved? After soil and water conservation projects are carried out in mountainous areas, the coverage is thickened, the water storage capacity is increased, and the runoff speed is slowed down. What changes will occur in the water level during the flood season? After a large area of floodwater is intercepted, what changes will occur in the flood peak? What changes will occur in the laws of flood prevention? After a large amount of water is stored, the amount of groundwater recharge increases, the water level rises, and what changes will occur in soil conditions? How to prevent salinization that may occur in some places due to the rise of the groundwater level? After there is a sufficient water source and the drought situation changes, what changes will occur in the climate conditions? And so on, all need us to make long-term observations and tests. This kind of observation and testing work should start now. Simple rain gauge stations, hydrological stations, and meteorological stations should be established in agricultural cooperatives with available conditions. Scientific and technical personnel from water conservancy departments and students from water conservancy professional schools should also go down to conduct observation and research work as much as possible when the flood season arrives.

Third, in some places, on the basis of building a large number of small-scale projects, the masses have developed the construction of medium-sized water conservancy projects. The technical requirements of this type of medium-sized project are higher than those of small-scale projects, so carelessness is not allowed, and sufficient technical force must follow up to ensure that no accidents occur.

Since the rural areas are about to shift to summer harvesting and summer planting as the center, the current water conservancy construction work should be carried out in conjunction with this center. Some places have adopted the form of infrastructure construction teams, which can be promoted.

In addition, we should start now to make a general plan for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring. This winter and next spring, we should continue to vigorously develop water conservancy construction, continue to implement the "three-main" policy of focusing on storage, small-scale, and people-run. On the basis of having small-scale projects, continue to build mass-based medium-sized projects. The masses' further demands for water conservancy construction, such as how to develop self-flowing irrigation after there is a sufficient water source, how to develop hydropower and shipping after meeting the needs of farmland irrigation, and how to comprehensively utilize water conservancy projects, etc., must be considered and planned as early as possible. This plan can be carried out from the bottom up first, and should be carried out on the basis of summarizing the water conservancy construction of last winter and this spring, so as to make the plan more active and more feasible based on the existing experience and lessons.

Our socialist construction is advancing rapidly, and our water conservancy construction has laid a good foundation. We believe that by continuing to move forward along the line pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which is to boost energy, strive for the upstream, and build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, our water conservancy construction will bloom with more magnificent flowers.

    发挥工程效益　今冬继续大干
    国务院第七办公室发言人谈农田水利建设工作
    本报讯　去冬今春的农田水利建设高潮，已告一段落，国务院第七办公室发言人对这次水利建设高潮及今后的水利建设工作，发表了如下书面谈话：水利建设一马当先
    在去冬今春全民性的向大自然进军中，农田水利建设一马当先，取得了伟大的胜利。这次水利建设高潮，是我国水利建设历史上的一次革命，是我国农民经过经济上政治上和思想上的社会主义大革命，经过社会生产力的大解放之后，把自己由受自然支配的奴隶变为支配自然的主人的一次革命。这次革命再不是枝枝节节、零零碎碎地向自然灾害作斗争，而是要从根本上改变自然的面貌——消灭普通的水旱灾害，实现水利化，保证农业生产的大跃进。全国农民在中国共产党的领导下，表现了愚公移山的顽强精神和无穷无尽的智慧，以人们无法估计的力量和难以想像的速度改变着自然的面貌。在雨量稀少、童山秃岭的甘肃地区，一个冬春扩大了灌溉面积一千多万亩，完成水土保持工程二万四千多平方公里。自古以来的干旱威胁，即将成为过去。河北在大兴水利的基础上，战胜了近三百天不下雨的干旱，基本上按时完成了春播任务。河南苦战一个冬春，使全省灌溉面积跃进到占耕地面积的百分之八十七，基本上实现了水利化。安徽一个冬春完成了五十多亿土石方的工作量，远远超过了八年来治淮工程土石方的工程总量。自去年10月到今年4月底的短短的二百天时间中，全国共扩大灌溉面积三亿五千万亩，改善灌溉面积一亿四千万亩，洼地治涝面积两亿多亩，水土保持初步控制面积达十六万平方公里，完成土石方的总量达二百五十亿公方。在高潮中，许多地方的农民提出了“苦干一冬、大战一春、实现水利化”，“向山要地，向水索粮”，“几年辛苦，万年幸福”等豪迈口号。他们变冬闲为冬忙，“思想不冻地不冻”，在零下三十度的严寒中坚持施工。他们咬牙苦干，节衣缩食，挤出资金，大搞水利。他们克服了一切困难，冲破了一切清规戒律，从山区到丘陵到平原到洼地，创造了各种各样的系统的水利工程。他们在向大自然进军中不仅斗力，而且善于斗智。随着工程规模的扩大，劳动量的增加，创造了成千成万的提高工效的工具。特别可贵的是他们在兴修水利中，打破了几千年祖传的只顾本乡本土的狭隘观念，互相关心，互相支援。如河南禹县号召平原人民支援山区，自动报名者即达六万多人。河北各县相互支援的农民达一百三十万人。我国农民不仅已经用水利建设的伟大胜利来狠狠地给了资产阶级右派分子一记响亮的耳光，而且将以在水利建设高潮中所表现的那种英雄气概和共产主义精神，把我国农村的社会主义建设事业又多又快又好又省地推向新的高潮。怎样发挥工程效益
    去冬今春所修的灌溉三亿五千万亩的工程，绝大部分都是修得很好的。其中有60％以上已经发生了效益，还有30％—40％的工程不能立即发生效益。其原因主要是去冬今春雨水少，水源不足，有的工程没有能够蓄上水。有的工程则本来就计划在汛期到来才能蓄水的。有的地方由于已经种上小麦等夏季作物或劳力不足，土地尚未平整，不能及时灌溉。也有一些地方因为提水工具不足，一时还不能发挥已有工程的效益。这些不能立即发挥效益的工程中，只有极少数是由于质量不好，需要加以整理提高，才能收效的。在大规模兴修水利的运动中，发生少数工程质量较差的现象是不奇怪的。现在会发生，将来也还会发生。这是合乎规律的现象。问题是领导思想要清醒，对这些质量较差的工程加以分析研究，找出原因，加以整理提高。我们相信，在群众已经广泛开展比干劲、比实效的竞赛运动中，这种质量较差的工程是会很快得到改善的。
    为了充分发挥现有工程的效益，根据各地已有的经验，主要应抓紧以下几点措施：第一，是抓紧雨后蓄水、引水、保水工作，通过各种引水、蓄水工程，拦蓄径流，不让水跑掉。第二，大力挖掘自流泉，拦蓄旱河潜流，充分发挥地下水的潜力，并尽可能做到渠灌与井灌结合的双保险。第三，加强灌溉管理，节约用水。第四，结合春播夏种，或利用农业生产间歇时间，积极平整土地。此外，解决提水工具不足的困难，主要应依靠群众。工业部门目前已尽了最大的努力，各地不能等待国家供应提水机械。应当继续大力提倡和推广各种改良提水工具，奖励群众发明创造，同时充分挖掘现有抽水机械的潜力。目前各地正在出现一个灌溉技术的革新运动，应当抓紧总结经验，训练干部，传授技术，使运动得以迅速开展。
    除充分发挥已有水利工程的效益外，当前在水利建设方面，还应当注意以下几件工作：新问题要及时解决
    第一，作好防汛准备。汛期即将到来，我们应当根据各地汛期到来时间，提前半个月做好准备工作。首先要注意防止麻痹大意。以为今年修了水土保持工程，防汛就可以松劲，这想法是不对的。今年不仅要在点线防汛，而且要在广大的面上防汛。思想上要有足够的准备。其次，要对防汛的设备、器材进行一次检查，及时堵塞漏洞，准备充分。第三，未完成的水库工程，要在汛期前完成。已完成的工程，应进行检查，防止事故。河北磁县牤牛河上五座小水库（内有四座正在施工）在4月23日一场较大的雨水中被冲毁，东武仕中型水库围埝被冲开，应引起各地注意。
    第二，做好工程的观察、测验工作。去冬今春在广大面积上兴修了各种各样的工程以后，向我们提出了许多新的问题。如各种各样的水利工程，哪些是最有效，应当继续发展的？哪些是还不够完善，应当加以提高的？哪些是效果很小，应加以改进的？山区的水土保持工程作了以后，复盖面增厚，蓄水能力加大，径流速度减缓，在汛期的水位上会发生什么变化？在大面积上拦蓄洪水以后，洪峰会发生什么变化？防洪的规律有什么改变？大量的蓄水以后，地下水的补给量增加，水位提高，土壤条件会发生什么变化？如何防止某些地方由于地下水位提高而可能发生的盐渍化？有了充足的水源，干旱面貌改变之后，气候条件会有些什么变化？等等，都有待于我们作长期的观察、测验。这种观察测验工作应当从现在就开始，如简易的雨量站、水文站、气象站，在有条件的农业合作社都应当设法建立起来。水利部门的科学技术人员及水利专业学校的学生在汛期到来时，也应当尽可能放下去进行观察研究工作。
    第三，有的地方在兴修大量的小型工程的基础上，已发展到群众性的兴修中型水利工程。这种中型工程的技术要求较小型工程为高，不能大意，必须有足够的技术力量跟上去，保证不出事故。
    由于目前农村即将转入以夏收夏种为中心，当前水利建设工作应当结合这个中心去进行。有些地方采取了基建队的形式，可以推行。
    此外，应当从现在开始，就对今冬明春的水利建设作出大体规划。今冬明春应当继续大干水利建设，继续贯彻以蓄为主、小型为主、民办为主的“三主”方针，在已经有了小型工程作为基础的条件下，继续修建群众性的中型工程。群众对水利建设的进一步要求，比如在有了充分水源之后如何发展自流灌溉，在满足了农田灌溉之后如何发展水电和航运，如何综合利用水利工程，等等，都必须及早加以考虑和规划。这一规划可以先由下而上进行，并且应当在总结去冬今春的水利建设的基础上来进行，以便从已有的经验教训出发，使规划更加积极，更加切实可行。
    我国社会主义的建设事业正在突飞猛进，我国的水利建设已经打下了一个良好的基础。我们相信，沿着党中央和毛主席指出的鼓起干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的路线继续前进，我国的水利建设事业将会开放出更多的奇花异彩的。（附图片）
