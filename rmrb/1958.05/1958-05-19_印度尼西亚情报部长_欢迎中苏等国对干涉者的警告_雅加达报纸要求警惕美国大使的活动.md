Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta – Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo said on the 17th, in response to the statements issued by the governments of the Soviet Union, China, India, Myanmar, and the United Arab Republic condemning foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, that the solidarity of Asian and African countries, including the Soviet Union, has strengthened Indonesia's political position. He said that foreign interventionists cannot ignore the warnings issued by countries friendly to Indonesia. If foreign interventionists persist in their actions, they will face not only Indonesia but also the entire Asian and African community directly.

Sudibjo also stated that the statements from friendly countries are, from a military standpoint, a stern warning, making it clear to foreign interventionists, particularly the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), that military power in the Pacific is not monopolized by SEATO member states. On the same day, the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper published an editorial stating that the statements issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments prove that the Indonesian people's struggle is not isolated. The newspaper demanded that the United States immediately cease its interventionist actions in Indonesia.

Jakarta's "People's Daily" also published an editorial stating that when people around the world express indignation at the United States' rampant hegemonism, the statements by the Soviet and Chinese governments warning against U.S. interference in Indonesian affairs are of great significance. The newspaper said that the clear purpose of these actions by the socialist camp is to prevent world war and promote the well-being of mankind. However, the actions of the United States in Latin America, Lebanon, or Indonesia are clearly intended to drag the world into the abyss of war.

"People's Daily" said, "If we adhere to our independent policy, if we cooperate with all countries that support this policy, all hegemonic acts of the United States will inevitably be defeated."

"Dongxing Bao" once again published a commentary saying that the statements of the Chinese and Soviet governments will have a far-reaching impact on world and Asian peace. If the United States is unwilling to stop this interventionist action, the people of the world who defend national independence will force it to stop.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 16th – Some newspapers in Jakarta warned on the 16th that people should be vigilant against a series of ambiguous activities recently conducted by the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Howard P. Jones.

"Dongxing Bao" pointed out that the current U.S. ambassador is actually continuing the work done by the former ambassador, Allison. Although the two ambassadors have adopted different methods, their goals are the same, which is to strengthen foreign subversion and rebellion.

"People's Daily" said that imperialists and their running dogs are currently trying to undermine the unity of democratic forces in Indonesia.

The newspaper, referring to reports about the U.S. ambassador's attempts to obstruct mass activities of the Indonesian people against foreign interference, said that this is blatant interference.

　　印度尼西亚情报部长
    欢迎中苏等国对干涉者的警告
    雅加达报纸要求警惕美国大使的活动
    据新华社雅加达讯　印度尼西亚情报部长苏迪比约17日就苏联、中国、印度、缅甸和阿拉伯联合共和国等国政府发表的谴责外国干涉印度尼西亚内政的声明发表谈话说，包括苏联在内的亚非国家的团结加强了印度尼西亚的政治地位。他说，外国干涉者不能忽视同印度尼西亚友好的国家发出的警告。如果外国干涉者坚持他们的行动，他们就将不仅面对着印度尼西亚，而且直接面对着全体亚非国家。
    苏迪比约还说，友好国家的声明从军事观点上看是严厉的警告，那就是让外国干涉者特别是东南亚条约组织清楚地看到，在太平洋上的军事力量并不是被东南亚条约组织的成员国所垄断的。同一天，“印度尼西亚火炬报”发表社论说，苏中两国政府发表的声明证明印度尼西亚人民的斗争不是孤立无援的。这家报纸要求美国迅速停止对印度尼西亚的干涉行动。
    雅加达“人民日报”也发表社论说，当全世界人民对美国横行霸道表示愤慨的时候，苏中两国政府对美国干涉印度尼西亚事务发出警告的声明具有重大意义。这家报纸说，社会主义阵营的这些行动的明确目的是为了防止世界战争和为人类谋福利。但是，美国在拉丁美洲、黎巴嫩或者印度尼西亚的行动却显然是要把世界拖入战争的深渊。
    “人民日报”说，“如果我们坚持我们的独立政策，如果我们同所有支持这种政策的国家合作，美国的一切霸道行为都必然会被挫败。”
    “东星报”再一次发表评论说，苏中两国政府的声明对于世界和亚洲和平将要产生深远的影响。如果美国不愿意停止这种干涉行动，全世界保卫民族独立的人民将要迫使它停止。
    据新华社雅加达16日电　雅加达一些报纸16日警告人们要警惕美国驻印度尼西亚大使琼斯最近进行的一系列暧昧活动。
    “东星报”指出，现任美国大使目前所进行的活动实际上是前任大使艾利逊所做的事情的继续。虽然两个大使所采取的手段不同，但他们的目的是相同的。那就是要加强外国的颠覆活动、加强叛乱活动。
    “人民日报”说，帝国主义分子和他们的走狗目前正在试图破坏印度尼西亚民主力量的团结。
    这家报纸在提到关于美国大使企图阻挠印度尼西亚人民展开反对外国干涉的群众性活动的消息时说，这就是粗暴的干涉。
