    Re-staging the Opera "Red Leaf River"
    The opera "Red Leaf River," once as famous as "The White-Haired Girl," has not been performed for several years. Yesterday, the Central Experimental Opera House began performing this opera at the Tianqiao Theater. This time, the plot has been slightly modified, making it more concise and compact than before. When the shepherd, Old Song, appears and sings, "Red Leaf River, Red Leaf River, Red Leaf River was originally a barren hill, twenty miles from east to west, a big mountain gully filled with dark holes," that deep and desolate tune brings the audience back to the situation twenty years before liberation: the deeply suffering Chinese peasants were reduced to ruin and death under the heavy exploitation of the evil landlords. In the past, this opera played a role in encouraging the peasants' fighting spirit during the land reform. Today, after watching this opera, the audience recalling the old hatred may well add strength to the current Great Leap Forward!

    重演歌剧“赤叶河”
    曾和“白毛女”齐名的歌剧“赤叶河”，已经好几年没上演了。昨天起中央实验歌剧院在天桥剧场演出这个歌剧。这回的演出，情节略有修改，比以前的显得简练紧凑。牧羊人老宋出场时唱的：“赤叶河，赤叶河，赤叶河本是个荒山坡，从东到西二十里，黑个洞洞个大山壑。”那深沉苍凉的调子，把观众带入了解放前二十来年中的境况里去：苦难深重的中国农民在恶霸地主敲骨吸髓的重重盘剥下弄得家破人亡。当年，这个歌剧对土改曾起了鼓舞农民斗志的作用。今天，看了这个歌剧，观众重忆旧恨，未必不能对当前的大跃进添一把劲！
