    Using Old Steel Rails to Lay Special Railways
    According to the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, the materials needed by enterprises to build railway special lines over the years are to be prepared by the enterprises themselves. However, the steel rails and accessories that enterprises apply to the state for are all new materials. As a result, using new steel to build railway special lines with small transportation volumes and low driving speeds cannot fully utilize the role of new steel rails. Conversely, many railway main lines with large transportation volumes and high driving speeds use old steel rails. Therefore, I suggest that the Ministry of Railways and other relevant departments consider exchanging new steel materials for old steel materials when building railway special lines in the future, so that new steel materials can be used on more needed lines.

    用旧钢轨铺专用铁路
    根据铁道部的规定，历年来各企业修建铁路专用线需用的材料，都由企业单位自备。而各企业向国家申请的钢轨和配件全是新料，结果用新钢材修建运输量小、行车速度低的铁路专用线，不能充分发挥新钢轨的作用，相反地许多运输量大、行车速度高的铁路正线，却用旧钢轨。因此，我建议铁道部及其他有关部门考虑今后修铁路专用线的时候，可以把新钢材掉换为旧钢材，好把新钢材用在更需要的线路上去。　广州铁路管理局　卢增善
