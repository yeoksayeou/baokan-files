Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th: The head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, Colonel Ha Van Lau, recently wrote to the International Commission, expressing his hope that the International Commission would take a firm attitude towards the increasingly frequent illegal import of war materials by the South Vietnamese regime.

	In his letter, Ha Van Lau requested the International Commission to suggest to the South Vietnamese authorities that they transport all war materials illegally imported into South Vietnam in violation of the Geneva Accords and the relevant agreements of the Central Joint Ceasefire Committee out of South Vietnam, and reiterated the suggestion that the South Vietnamese regime correctly implement Article 17 of the Geneva Accords regarding the prohibition of illegal import of war materials and other relevant provisions of the agreements.

	Ha Van Lau also requested the International Commission to express its attitude towards the 114 incidents of weapons import that the commission had recorded by October 30, 1957, which it considered possible violations of Article 17 of the Geneva Accords by the South Vietnamese authorities, and to inform the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army of the handling of some protests raised by the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army in the past, which the commission had confirmed to be specific and well-founded.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th: According to an announcement today, Ha Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the International Commission on the 22nd, accusing the South Vietnamese authorities of persecuting former resistance personnel. The letter said that nearly four years have passed since the end of the Indochina War, but hundreds of thousands of former resistance personnel are still being detained in various prisons and concentration camps in South Vietnam, and are being subjected to torture.

	In his letter, Ha Van Lau condemned the actions of the South Vietnamese authorities in carrying out terrorist suppression and retaliation against former resistance personnel and South Vietnamese people who hope for peace and national unity in the so-called "Anti-Communist Movement."

	In his letter, Ha Van Lau pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities had openly declared their so-called "Anti-Communist" policy as a "national policy." In implementing this "national policy," the South Vietnamese authorities are increasingly colluding with the United States and other Southeast Asia Treaty Organization countries.

	The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army requested the International Commission to send mobile teams, including liaison personnel from both sides, to the site to investigate the situation. The Liaison Delegation also requested the International Commission to suggest that the South Vietnamese authorities abolish laws that violate Article 14C of the Geneva Accords, end the second "Anti-Communist Movement," and disband the concentration camps in South Vietnam, release all former resistance personnel and other patriots detained by the South Vietnamese authorities, and guarantee them democratic freedom.

    南越当局非法运入战争物资并迫害前抗战人员
    越南主张严格处理并进行调查
    据新华社河内25日电　越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼上校最近写信给国际委员会，表示希望国际委员会采取坚决的态度来对待南越政权越来越频繁地非法输入战争物资的行为。
    何文楼在信里要求国际委员会向南越当局建议：把他们过去违反日内瓦协议和中央联合停战委员会有关协议的规定而非法运进南越的一切战争物资运出南越，并且再次建议南越政权正确执行日内瓦协议第十七条关于禁止非法运入战争物资的规定和其他协议的有关规定。
    何文楼还要求国际委员会对到1957年10月30日为止委员会已经记录下来认为南越当局可能违反日内瓦协议第十七条的一百一十四次运进武器事件表示态度，并且把委员会对越南人民军联络代表团过去提出的、并且经委员会确认是具体的和有根据的一些抗议的处理办法告诉越南人民军联络代表团。
    据新华社河内25日电　据今天公布，越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼22日写信给国际委员会，控诉南越当局迫害前抗战人员。信中说，印度支那战争结束以后已近四年，但是，仍然有数以十万计的前抗战人员被拘禁在南越的各种监狱和集中营里，受到了折磨。
    何文楼在信中谴责南越当局在所谓“控共运动”中对前抗战人员和希望和平和国家统一的南越人士实施恐怖镇压和报复的行动。
    何文楼在信中指出，南越当局曾经公然宣布他们的所谓“控共”政策是“国策”。南越当局在施行它的这种“国策”中，越来越密切地串同美国和其它一些东南亚条约组织国家共谋进行。
    越南人民军联络代表团要求国际委员会派遣包括有双方联络人员的机动小组到现场调查这一情况。联络代表团同时要求国际委员会建议南越当局废除违反日内瓦协议第十四条丙款的法律，结束第二次“控共运动”，并且解散南越的集中营，释放南越当局拘禁的一切前抗战人员和其他爱国者，并且保证他们获得民主自由。
