A Record of "Ten Thousand Jin Sweet Potatoes"

Luo Yunlai, Second Secretary of the CPC Huaiyin Prefectural Committee of Jiangsu Province

The "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes" attracted me, and I visited Suqian County with a happy heart to see the "ten thousand jin sweet potatoes."

I first met Comrade Li Bai, the county party secretary, who started talking about his "ten thousand jin sweet potato" ideas before I could even ask a question. He said that he was moved when he saw reports of Hunan and Hubei achieving miracles of 30,000 jin of sweet potatoes per mu. Later, after hearing about the Siyang Farm producing 10,097 jin of sweet potatoes per mu, he was convinced that sweet potatoes were the key to increasing production; to achieve a great leap forward, it was necessary to focus on sweet potatoes. He gave me a calculation: if 500,000 mu of the county's 1.8 million mu of grain fields were planted with sweet potatoes, producing 10,000 jin per mu, that would be 5 billion jin. With four jin of fresh sweet potatoes equivalent to one jin of grain, that would be 1.25 billion jin of grain. The equivalent of 1.25 billion jin of grain is 500 jin per mu on 2.5 million mu of land or 1,000 jin per mu on 1.25 million mu of land, as long as we focus on sweet potatoes, we can achieve "full granaries, full pigsties, and a thousand-jin county."

"Are ten thousand jin sweet potatoes reliable?" In order to solve this problem, I visited Xie Yufa, an old farmer from Xiangli Commune. This old farmer told me that he had planted 2,900 sweet potato seedlings in one mu of wheat stubble, applied 40 loads of fertilizer, and harvested 5,300 jin, with some individual sweet potatoes weighing five and a half jin. I asked him, "Can one mu yield 10,000 jin?" He said that now the commune is using improved varieties, cultivating seedlings in hotbeds, promoting wide ridges with double rows and dense planting, and planting after Grain Rain, planting 5,000 seedlings per mu, applying 2,000 loads of fertilizer, planting two months earlier than my old method, planting 2,100 more seedlings, and increasing the amount of fertilizer fiftyfold. The land is dug deep and thoroughly, so if each sweet potato grows to ten jin, that would be 50,000 jin; if each grows to five jin, that would be 25,000 jin; if each grows to two jin, we'll still harvest 10,000 jin. Judging by this year's momentum, we can harvest 100,000 jin per mu. The old farmer told me this with great optimism based on his own experience.

Glass Hotbeds

I walked through Xiangli Commune and arrived at Chengxi Commune. In front of the Chengxi Commune building, there was a large area that shimmered with silver light – that was the Chengxi Commune sweet potato glass hotbed seedling field. This field had fifty hotbeds, each ten chi long and four chi wide, similar to greenhouses. Row upon row, structure upon structure, facing south and backing north towards the sun, sunlight shone on the glass, and the glass reflected the tender green sweet potato seedlings, which was a beautiful sight.

I entered the field, and Comrade Liu Lishan, the field director, told me that at the beginning, the commune members had many concerns about building hotbeds, and many people made sarcastic remarks, saying "Sweet potatoes are even more fortunate than people, living in glass houses." Some said: "We commune members are spending money, and you cadres are putting on a show; if the seedlings don't come out, we'll be ruined." I asked him if the commune members still had any concerns now, and he said with a smile that they had changed their tune, and they weren't worried about the sweet potatoes not sprouting, but worried about not being able to eat all the sweet potatoes this year. Comrade Yan Zutian, the deputy county party secretary who came with me, told me that there were a total of 30,000 glass hotbeds like those in Chengxi Commune throughout the county, and the seedlings in each bed were sprouting early and growing vigorously. It is estimated that each bed can plant twenty mu of land; in addition to the earthen beds, not only will the county's 500,000 mu of sweet potatoes be planted early, but it can also support 400,000 mu of sweet potato seedlings in other counties.

Experimental Field

Next to the Chengxi Commune glass hotbed field, there was a newly turned piece of land. On one side of the land, several rows of ridges had been built, and these ridges lay there like many sleeping dragons with their heads in order – this was the county party committee's sweet potato experimental field. This field had sandy soil and had been deeply plowed three times last winter and this spring. Each mu had been fertilized with 1,500 loads of river mud, and now artificial deep digging was being done to a depth of one chi and five cun, preparing to apply another 5,000 jin of miscellaneous fertilizer as base fertilizer. These newly built ridges were models made on March 10th when the county party committee held a meeting of township party committee secretaries here to promote wide ridges with double rows and dense planting. The ridges were one chi high, two chi and two cun wide at the bottom, and one chi and two cun wide at the top, with a ridge distance of three chi. Each ridge can plant two rows of sweet potatoes, with 5,000 plants per mu. When the seedlings were cultivated in the hotbeds, the township party committee secretaries attended classes and practiced hotbed seedling cultivation techniques in this field, and now they are coming again to attend classes and practice wide ridges with double rows and dense planting techniques on this land. This land is a classroom for implementing "ten thousand jin sweet potato" technology, and a place for county and township leaders to become "both red and expert." Not only will a miracle of high sweet potato yields appear on this land, but sweet potato experts will also be cultivated.

On Mount Maling

After visiting Chengxi Commune, I crossed the Grand Canal and went to Xiaodian Township, passing through Jing'ertou on the way. Three magnificent and tall buildings stood in the sky above Jing'ertou: the Luoma Lake Sluice Gate, the Suqian Ship Lock, and the Liutang River Sluice Gate, which are about to be completed. On Mount Maling, which stands side by side with the three major buildings, grapes were stretching and sprouting buds, willows were releasing leaves to form shade, and newly planted small pine trees covered the hillside. Looking around, I could only see wheat waves like the sea, and red flags flying. What a scene of a great leap forward in production!

I walked down the hillside and watched the people tilling the land in a field marked with a red flag. Among the people tilling the land was a young man wearing a short jacket, with a one-inch square piece of red cloth pinned to the left front of his jacket, with the words "Ten Thousand Jin Sweet Potato Work Team" written on it. I asked him who the team leader was. He said it was Secretary Li and Deputy Secretary Yan of the county party committee. Deputy Secretary Yan, who was present, told me that when the sweet potato seedlings were being cultivated in hotbeds, the county party committee transferred 150 cadres, who underwent short-term technical training, and formed a sweet potato hotbed seedling cultivation work team. Now that the hotbeds have been built, the county party committee has changed this group of people into a ten thousand jin sweet potato work team, specializing in providing technical guidance for ten thousand jin sweet potatoes.

Under the command of this young man, the people tilling the land dug the topsoil aside, and then dug the deep soil under the topsoil about one chi deep, applied fertilizer, and then covered the raw soil with the topsoil, and then while making ridges, they also applied fertilizer in the ridges. The ridges were very large, identical in specifications to the county party committee's experimental field. I used a thin stick to go from the top of the ridge all the way to the bottom and pulled it out, and it was a full one chi and five cun deep. I measured the width of the bottom and top of the ridge and the ridge distance, and they all met the technical standards set by the county party committee. I asked an older person why the land was dug so deep and the ridges were made so large. The old man wiped the sweat from his forehead with one hand and held the tool in his hand and said to me: "This is new technology. If the soil is not loose and the ridges are not large, large sweet potatoes cannot grow." "Is there enough labor to do this?" "Yes! With collectivization, the land can be turned into a vegetable garden. Manually digging is better than plowing with cattle, and five days is enough to dig." The old man answered my questions while turning the soil. Comrade Yan Zutian told me that 150,000 mu of spring sweet potato fields throughout the county are being implemented according to the artificial ridge preparation, wide ridge double-row dense planting technology. Starting today, 150,000 people will be mobilized every day throughout the county to till the land. After hearing his words, I realized that the people filling the fields today were all tilling the land for ten thousand jin sweet potatoes.

Early Sweet Potatoes Under Black Bowls

Along the way, I unknowingly arrived at Xiaodian Township. Secretary Qiu of Xiaodian Township led me to Hubin Commune to see a plot of early sweet potatoes that had already been planted. These sweet potatoes were planted on April 10th. On the day the sweet potatoes were planted, Hubin Commune was like it was holding a big celebration, with men, women, old and young coming to see the rare event of planting sweet potatoes before Grain Rain, to see the technique of planting double rows on each ridge, to see the dense planting of 5,000 plants per mu, to see the great leap forward of sweet potatoes, and to see the enthusiasm of Hubin Commune. In order to protect the growth of the sweet potato seedlings, the cadres and masses of Hubin Commune took out thousands of black bowls and covered the sweet potatoes one by one every night to protect them from frost and freezing. The next day, after the sun came out, they took off the black bowls one by one, allowing the tender sweet potato seedlings to grow in the warm sunlight. Such a novel planting method has probably never been heard of at home or abroad! But I saw it, I saw a plot of early sweet potatoes protected by black bowls, which had now raised their seedlings, taken root, and were growing vigorously.

　　“万斤山芋”见闻记
　　中共江苏省淮阴地委第二书记　罗运来
　　“万斤山芋”吸引着我，我带着喜悦的心情去宿迁县访问了“万斤山芋”。
    我首先见到县委书记李柏同志，他不等我问话，就大谈他的“万斤山芋”思想。他说，他在报上看到湖南、湖北有亩产三万斤山芋的奇迹，心就动了。后又听到泗阳农场有亩产一万零九十七斤山芋的事例，就认定山芋是增产的大头；要跃进，就要抓山芋。他向我算了一笔账：全县一百八十万亩粮田，如种五十万亩山芋，亩产一万斤，就是五十亿斤；以四斤鲜山芋折一斤粮，就是十二亿五千万斤粮；十二亿五千万斤粮等于二百五十万亩地亩产五百斤，一百二十五万亩地亩产一千斤，只要揪住山芋这一项，就可“粮满仓，猪满圈，实现千斤县”。
    “万斤山芋可靠吗？”我为了解决这个问题，访问了项里社老农谢玉发。这位老农告诉我，他曾在一亩麦茬地里栽上二千九百棵山芋，施肥四十担，收五千三百斤，有一眼大的，长五斤半重。我问他“一亩能不能收一万斤？”他说，现在社里选用良种，搞温床育苗，推行大垅双行密植，谷雨后栽插，每亩栽五千棵，施肥两千担，比我过去老办法早栽两个月，多栽二千一百棵，肥量增加五十倍，地挖得又深又透，每眼长十斤，就是五万斤；每眼长五斤，就是两万五千斤；每眼长二斤，还收一万斤。看今年的劲头，一亩十万斤也能收。这位老农以自己的经验，万分乐观地对我讲了这席话。
    玻璃温床
    我走过项里社，到了城西社。城西社的社房前面，有片大地，银光闪闪，那就是城西社山芋玻璃温床育苗场。这场有五十个温床，每床长一丈、宽四尺，和花房相似。一排排，一座座，面南背北地对着太阳，阳光照耀着玻璃，玻璃掩映着嫩绿的芋苗，煞是好看。
    我走进场房，场长刘立山同志告诉我，开始社员对搞温床育苗，有不少顾虑，不少人说风凉话，说“山芋比人还享福，住玻璃房子。”有的说：“我们社员花钱，你们干部摆阵，不出苗就坑了。”我问他现在社员还有什么顾虑，他笑着说，现在嘴都倒过来了，不是顾虑山芋不出苗，而是顾虑今年山芋吃不了。和我同来的县委副书记严祖田同志告诉我，全县像城西社的玻璃温床，共有三万个，床床苗子都出的早，长的旺，预计每床可栽二十亩地；加上土床子，除本县五十万亩山芋可以得到早栽外，还可支援外县四十万亩地的山芋秧子。
    试验田
    在城西社玻璃温床场的旁边，有一块新翻的土地。在地的一边，已打好几行垅，这些垅就像许多条睡龙顺着头躺在那里——这就是县委山芋试验田。这块田是砂质土壤，去冬今春已深耕过三次，每亩施过河泥一千五百担，现又用人工深挖一尺五寸，准备再施杂肥五千斤作基肥。这些新打的垅，是3月10日县委开乡党委书记会议在这里推行大垅双行密植做的样子。垅高一尺，垅底宽二尺二寸，垅面宽一尺二寸，垅距三尺，每垅可栽两行山芋，每亩可栽五千棵。温床育苗时，乡党委书记在这块田里听过课，实习过温床育苗技术，现在又来听课，又在这块地上实习大垅双行密植的技术。这块地是贯彻“万斤山芋”技术的课堂，是县乡两级领导干部“又红又专”的场地。在这块土地上，不但要出现山芋高产的奇迹，而且要培植出山芋的专家。
    马陵山上
    我访问过城西社，跨过运河，去晓店乡，路经井儿头。井儿头的高空，矗立着三个宏伟高大的建筑物，那就是即将完工的骆马湖节制闸、宿迁船闸、六塘河节制闸。与三大建筑物并立的马陵山上，葡萄伸腰吐芽，杨柳放叶成荫，新栽的小松树布满山岗。举目四望，只见麦浪似海，红旗飘扬。好一派生产大跃进的情景！
    我走下山坡，到一块田头上竖有红旗的人群中看着整地。这群整地的人中有个青年，身着短袄，短袄的左前襟上，别上一块一寸见方的红布，红布上写着“万斤山芋工作队”几个字。我问他队长是谁？他说是县委的李书记和严副书记。在场的严副书记告诉我，山芋温床育苗时，县委抽调一百五十个干部，经过短期技术训练，成立山芋温床育苗工作队，现在温床已搞好了，县委又把这批人改为万斤山芋工作队，专做万斤山芋的技术指导工作。
    在这个青年指挥下，整地的人把表土挖放在一边，然后又把表土下的深土挖上尺把深，施肥后，又把表土盖在生土上，然后就一面打垅，一面又在垅中施肥。垅很高大，和县委试验田的规格一模一样，我用根细棍，从垅顶一通到底，拔起来看，足有一尺五寸深。我量了垅底垅面的宽度和垅距，都合乎县委布置的技术标准。我问一个年纪大的人，为何把地挖这样深，把垅做这样大？这老人一手抹去额上的汗珠，一手握住手里的工具对我讲：“这是新技术，地不透，垅不大，就不能长出大山芋来。”“这样做劳力够吗？”“够！有了合作化，土地就能菜园化，人挖比牛耕的好，不够五天挖的。”这位老人，一面翻土，一面回答我提出的问题。严祖田同志告诉我，全县十五万亩春山芋田，都是按人工整畦、大垅双行密植技术进行贯彻的。从今天开始，全县每天要出动十五万人整地。我听了他的话，才知道今天布满田野的人们，都是在为万斤山芋而整地的。
    黑碗下的早芋
    一路走来，不知不觉的到了晓店乡。晓店乡的仇支书，领我到湖滨社看一块已栽下的早山芋。这块山芋是4月10日栽的，栽山芋的这一天，湖滨社就像办大喜事一样，周围男女老少都来看，看看未到谷雨就栽山芋的奇闻，看看每垅栽双行的技术，看看每亩栽五千棵的密植看看山芋大跃进，看看湖滨社的干劲。湖滨社的干群为了保护山芋幼苗的生长，全体社员拿出几千个黑碗，每天晚上用黑碗把山芋一棵一棵的罩起来，以防霜防冻。第二天太阳出来以后，又把黑碗一个一个的取下来，让那幼嫩的芋苗在温暖的阳光下成长。这种新奇的种植方法，古今中外都未听说过吧！但我是见到了，我见到了在黑碗保护下的一块早山芋，现在已挺起苗头，扎下根须，健壮地成长起来。
