Great Leap Forward in Chemical Fertilizer Industry
	66 Small and Medium-Sized Fertilizer Plants to be Built This Year

	(Our Dispatch) This year, a total of sixty-six small and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants will be built across the country. These factories will be located throughout the country. Once completed and put into production, they will add more than 2.7 million tons of chemical fertilizer to the country annually, equivalent to more than three times China's total fertilizer production in 1957.

	During the Second Five-Year Plan period, China will continue to build thousands of small and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants. These small and medium-sized plants, together with some newly built and expanded large-scale fertilizer plants, will enable China's fertilizer production to reach levels unimaginable by relying solely on the construction of large plants in the past. During the First Five-Year Plan period, the average annual increase in production from the three large plants in Nanjing, Dalian, and Jilin was only 120,000 tons. After implementing the construction policy of "combining large, medium, and small, with medium and small as the mainstay," the speed of China's chemical fertilizer industry construction will accelerate dozens of times.

	Among the sixty-six small and medium-sized factories to be built this year, twenty-one are medium-sized plants with an annual output of 100,000 tons run by provinces and municipalities, seven are level-three small plants with an annual output of 40,000 tons run by special districts, and thirty-six are level-four small plants with an annual output of 8,000 tons run by counties. In addition, there are two small-scale demonstration factories run by the Ministry of Chemical Industry in Beijing and Shanghai. Currently, the medium-sized plants in Henan, Hebei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Guangdong, and other provinces and cities, as well as the demonstration factories run by the Ministry of Chemical Industry, have all started construction. The small-scale demonstration factory in Shanghai with an annual output of 8,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer will be put into production on "May 1st." Other medium-sized and small-sized factories will also begin construction successively from the second quarter.

	Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Beijing, Hebei, and other provinces and cities are organizing local machinery factories to rush produce mechanical equipment for the chemical fertilizer industry. Liaoning has seven machinery factories that can produce ten sets of equipment for level-four small-scale nitrogen fertilizer plants within the year. In addition to supplying six sets to the province, it can also provide four sets to support other regions. Shanghai and Heilongjiang are also prepared to help Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and other regions with insufficient mechanical manufacturing capacity, in addition to meeting local needs. In addition to the equipment for level-three and level-four small plants, Zhejiang is also preparing to manufacture some more complex medium-sized equipment. General medium-sized equipment is currently being arranged for production by the First Ministry of Machine Building. Many provinces and cities have also transferred a large number of engineering and technical personnel and workers from existing machinery and light industry factories and assembled construction and installation forces to support the construction of chemical fertilizer plants. Workers building a medium-sized chemical fertilizer plant in Henan proposed: Rest in the shade in the summer and live in cave dwellings in the winter, saving the time for building construction sheds and investing it in construction, striving to complete the civil engineering work by the end of the year and ensuring that the factory is put into production half a year ahead of schedule. The medium-sized chemical fertilizer plant in Hebei is also preparing to overtake Henan and put it into production in the first half of next year.

	The Ministry of Chemical Industry has basically completed the design of twenty-eight types of small and medium-sized chemical fertilizer plants for various regions, which can be supplied to various regions for ordering equipment and organizing construction. Each of the existing three large fertilizer plants is training engineering and technical personnel and skilled workers for more than eight provinces and cities. The fertilizer plants under construction in Lanzhou, Sichuan, and Beijing are also responsible for training installation personnel for various provinces and cities. The Ministry of Chemical Industry has also sent working groups to North China, East China, and Central South China to help review and appraise factory sites. When the factories are put into production in the future, they also plan to organize start-up teams to help regions with insufficient technical strength start trial runs. (Attached picture)

    化学肥料工业大跃进
    今年建设66个中小型化肥厂
    本报讯　今年全国一共建设六十六个中小型化肥厂。这些工厂遍布全国各地，它们建成投入生产后，每年给国家增加的二百七十多万吨化学肥料，相当于我国1957年全部化肥产量的三倍多。
    我国在第二个五年计划期间还要陆续建设成千座中小型化肥厂，这些中小型化肥厂加上新建、扩建的一些大型化肥厂，将使我国化肥生产达到过去单靠建设大厂所不能设想的水平。在第一个五年计划期间，南京、大连、吉林三个大厂的产量平均每年不过增长十二万吨。贯彻“大、中、小相结合，以中、小型为主”的建设方针以后。我国化肥工业建设速度将加快几十倍。
    在今年兴建的六十六个中小型工厂中，有二十一个是由省市举办的年产十万吨的中型厂，七个由专区举办的年产四万吨的三级小型厂和三十六个由县举办的年产八千吨的四级小型厂，另外还有两个由化工部在北京上海举办的小型示范性工厂。现在河南、河北、浙江、安徽、湖南、广东等各省市的中型厂和化工部办的示范厂都已开始施工，上海年产八千吨氮肥的小型示范厂在“五一”就可以投入生产。其他中型厂和小型厂也将从第二季度起陆续动工。
    辽宁、黑龙江、上海、北京、河北等省市都在组织当地机械工厂赶制化肥工业的机械设备。辽宁有七个机械工厂年内可以做好十套四级小型氮肥厂的设备，其中除了六套供应本省以外，还可以拿四套支援其他地区；上海、黑龙江也准备在满足本地需要之外帮助内蒙古、青海、新疆等机械制造能力不足的地区。浙江除了三级和四级小型厂的设备以外，还准备制造一部分比较复杂的中型设备。一般中型设备，目前已由第一机械部安排生产。许多省市还从原有的机械、轻工业工厂中抽调了大批的工程技术人员和工人，集结了建筑、安装力量，支援化肥厂的建设。河南建设中型化肥厂的工人提出：夏天歇树荫，冬天住窑洞，省出修工棚的时间投入建设，争取在年底前完成土建工程，保证工厂提前半年投入生产。河北中型化肥厂还准备赶过河南，在明年上半年投入生产。
    化工部为各地赶制的二十八项各种中小化肥厂的设计，目前都已基本完成，可以供给各地定制设备和组织施工。现有的三个大型肥料厂，每厂都正为八个以上的省市培养工程技术人员和技术工人；正在建设的兰州、四川、北京等肥料厂也担任了为各省市培养安装人员的任务。化工部还派出工作组到华北、华东、中南等地帮助复查鉴定厂址，将来工厂投入生产的时候，他们还准备组织开工队帮助技术力量不足的地区开工试车。（附图片）
