Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 29th: It is reported that in Lebanon's second-largest city, Tripoli, insurgent people's forces continued to repel attacks by pro-Western government forces on the 28th. Meanwhile, insurgents in other areas continue to maintain and consolidate their controlled territories, and strikes and market closures continue.

Government forces have been trying for days to regain control of Tripoli but have been repeatedly repelled by insurgent forces. In the fighting on the 28th, the people's forces burned a government tank.

Meanwhile, as the large-scale anti-government movement that began on May 9th enters its fourth week, imperialist countries are more brazenly interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs, helping the increasingly unstable pro-Western government to suppress the patriotic people.

Following the airlift of arms to aid the pro-Western government, the United States shipped eighteen tanks to Chamoun on a transport ship on the 28th. When this batch of tanks arrived in Beirut, the pro-Western government authorities, fearing that the people would find out, had military police blockaded the docks and access roads to the port. According to a broadcast by "Free Lebanon Radio," the U.S. Sixth Fleet is currently operating about two miles off the Lebanese coast.

According to Damascus' "Al-Jamahir" newspaper, British aircraft also transported a batch of arms to Beirut on the 28th, including automatic weapons and rifles. It is also reported that four British warships and an aircraft carrier are anchored off the Lebanese coast.

Aircraft from Iraq, a member of the Baghdad Pact, also transported a batch of weapons to Beirut on the 28th. According to Damascus' "Al-Barada" newspaper, ten Iraqi aircraft participated in the bombing of insurgent forces in Halba last week.

According to Damascus' "Al-Nour" newspaper, an Israeli truck arrived at the southern Lebanese border on the 28th and also unloaded a batch of automatic weapons.

It is reported that the Lebanese gendarmerie commander has resigned in protest because the pro-Western government distributed weapons supplied by Western countries to newly recruited so-called "volunteers." It is reported that these "volunteers" are mostly supporters of Chamoun's fascist National Socialist Party members.

According to the Middle East News Agency, the Lebanese cabinet decided on the 28th to close seven newspapers belonging to opposition parties, namely "Al Siyasa," "Beirut Evening News," "Al Kifah," "Al Jiran," "Kul Shay" Weekly, "Al Hawadess" Weekly, and "Al Sayyad" Weekly, and to continue to implement forced censorship of other newspapers. Minister of Information Kozma disagreed with this decision and has resigned.

Meanwhile, under the direction of the imperialists, behind-the-scenes activities aimed at dividing the opposition parties and inducing them to compromise are being intensified. National Front leader Salam said on the 28th, "Any solution that is not based on Chamoun's resignation is unacceptable." According to Damascus' "Al-Nour" newspaper, Maronite Archbishop Maushi also stated on the same day that he would firmly oppose Chamoun and would fully cooperate with the people in the struggle against treason and Eisenhowerism.

    黎巴嫩起义军坚守阵地
    各地罢工罢市仍继续坚持中
    美英不断把军火运交黎政府镇压人民
    新华社大马士革29日电　据报道，黎巴嫩第二大城的黎波里的起义人民部队在28日继续击退亲西方政府部队的进攻。同时，其他各地起义者也继续保持和巩固他们的控制地区，罢工罢市还在坚持进行。
    政府部队已经连续几天企图夺回对的黎波里的控制，但是一再被起义部队打退。在28日的战斗中，人民部队烧毁了政府部队的一辆坦克。
    同时，在从5月9日开始的大规模反政府运动就要进入第四个星期的时候，帝国主义国家更加肆无忌惮地干涉黎巴嫩内政，帮助地位日益不稳的亲西方政府来镇压爱国人民。
    美国继空运军火接济亲西方政府之后，又在28日用一艘运输舰把十八辆坦克运交给夏蒙。在这批坦克运到贝鲁特时，亲西方政府当局害怕人民知道，军警曾经封锁了贝鲁特的码头和通往港口的通路。据“自由黎巴嫩电台”广播，美国第六舰队目前正在离开黎巴嫩海岸约两英里的海面活动。
    据大马士革“群众报”报道，英国飞机也在28日把一批军火运到贝鲁特，其中包括自动武器和步枪。另据报道，英国四艘军舰和一艘航空母舰正停泊在黎巴嫩沿岸海面。
    巴格达条约成员国伊拉克的飞机在28日也运一批武器到贝鲁特。据大马士革“巴赖达报”报道，十架伊拉克飞机在上星期参加轰炸哈勒巴起义部队。
    据大马士革“光明报”报道，一辆以色列卡车在28日到达黎巴嫩南部边境，也卸下了一批自动武器。
    有消息说，由于亲西方政府把西方国家接济的武器分发给新招募的所谓“志愿人员”，黎巴嫩宪兵司令已经辞职以表示抗议。据报道，这些“志愿人员”多是支持夏蒙的法西斯组织国家社会党党徒。
    据中东通讯社报道，黎巴嫩内阁在28日决定封闭属于反对党派的七家报刊，即“政治报”、“贝鲁特晚报”、“斗争报”、“邻人报”、“万事”周刊、“事件”周刊和“萨亚德”周刊，并且对其他报刊继续实行强迫检查。新闻部长考兹马不同意这个决定，已经辞职。
    同时，在帝国主义者指使下，企图分化反对党和诱使反对党妥协的幕后活动仍在加紧进行。民族阵线领袖萨拉姆在28日说，“任何不是以夏蒙辞职为基础的解决办法都是不能接受的。”据大马士革“光明报”报道，马罗派大主教毛希在同一天也表示将坚决反对夏蒙，并且将同人民充分合作，进行反对卖国和艾森豪威尔主义的斗争。
