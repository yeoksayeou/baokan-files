Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th. Ding Zhaorong, a teacher from Tongji University in Shanghai, who was sent to the Pioneer Second Commune in the northern suburbs of Shanghai, worked with the commune members to establish an agricultural laboratory station. In just over fifty days, they have conducted a general survey of more than 200 mu of land in a production team, analyzed the distribution of clay, saline-alkali soil, and low-lying land, and drawn maps in preparation for soil improvement work. They also used waste liquid from factories to trial-produce more than 40 tons of low-cost nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers, which are now being promoted and tested in this production team and are very popular among farmers.

    This agricultural laboratory station is located in a dilapidated house. The few indispensable instruments, scales, and medicines were all supported by Tongji University. In addition to Ding Zhaorong, a teacher from Tongji University, the personnel include only two local junior high school graduates and Wang Tongzheng, a technician from the agricultural technology extension station. They have a large workload every day, spending all day in the fields investigating the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of the soil, studying the factors and conditions of plant growth, and using pot cultivation to experiment with various soils and researched fertilizers.

   上海同济大学教师
    帮助先锋二社建立化验站
    据新华社上海24日电　下放到上海北郊区先锋二社的同济大学教师丁兆荣，同社员们一起建立了一个农业化验站。短短的五十几天中，他们已经把一个生产队的二百多亩土地作了一次普查，分析出粘土、盐碱土、低凹地等土地的分布，绘成了图样，准备进行改良土壤工作。他们又利用工厂里放出来的废液，试制出了四十多吨成本低廉的氮、磷、钾肥，现在已经在这个生产队里推广试用，很受农民欢迎。
    这个农业化验站设在一个破旧的房屋里，几件不可缺少的仪器、天平和药品，都是同济大学支援的。人员除同济大学教师丁兆荣外，只有当地的两个初中毕业生和农业技术推广站技术员王统正。他们每天进行的工作量很大，一天到晚在农田里调查土壤中所含氮、磷、钾的成分，研究植物生长的因素与状况，把各种不同的土壤和研究出来的各种肥料，利用盆栽来进行试验。
