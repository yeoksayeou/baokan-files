    Xinhua News Agency, 29th. According to a Kyodo News Agency reporter in Washington on the 28th: The US Congress on the 28th finally passed a bill to triple import tariffs on Japanese rubber shoes. The bill has been sent to US President Eisenhower for approval.
    The aforementioned bill was proposed by US Representative Sadrack in August of last year. Both the House of Representatives and the Senate have passed the bill, and the House Ways and Means Committee finally determined the implementation date of the bill on the 28th. If the bill is approved by Eisenhower, it will take effect in September of this year.
    On the same day, the Fisheries Subcommittee of the US House of Representatives approved the Perry Bill on banning the import of Japanese canned salmon and submitted the bill to the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries for review. The US Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior believe that, under pressure from the US fishing industry, they will eventually have to boycott imports of Japanese canned salmon. Currently, the United States and Japan are negotiating on restricting Japanese fishing of red salmon. It is reported that the US government has recently, in effect, restricted Japanese fishermen from fishing for red salmon in Bristol Bay.
    Tadashi Ishizaka, chairman of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations, expressed his "regret" at the recent series of measures taken by the United States to restrict imports of Japanese goods at the general meeting of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations held on the 28th.

    新华社29日讯　据共同社记者28日从华盛顿报道：美国国会在28日最后通过了关于把日本胶鞋进口关税提高三倍的法案。这项法案已经送交美国总统艾森豪威尔批准。
    上述法案是美国众议院议员萨德拉克在去年8月提出的。众议院和参议院先后通过了这项法案，众议院筹款委员会最后在28日确定了法案的实施日期。如果这项法案经艾森豪威尔批准，就将在今年9月间开始实施。
    同一天，美国众议院渔业小组委员会同意了关于禁止日本鲑鱼罐头进口的佩里法案，并且把这项法案送交众议院商船和渔业委员会审查。美国商务部和内政部认为，在美国渔业界的压力下最后将不得不抵制日本鲑鱼罐头进口。目前，美日之间正在进行关于限制日本捕红鲑鱼的谈判。据报道，美国政府最近在实际上已经限制日本渔民在布利斯托尔湾捕红鲑鱼。
    日本经济团体联合会会长石坂泰三在28日举行的经济团体联合会全体会议上，对于美国最近接连采取限制日货进口的措施“表示遗憾”。
