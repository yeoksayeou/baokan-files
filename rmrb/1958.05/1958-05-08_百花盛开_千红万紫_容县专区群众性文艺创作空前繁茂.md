A Hundred Flowers Bloom, Thousands of Reds and Purples
    Mass Literary Creation in Rongxian Prefecture Flourishes Unprecedentedly

    [This article is transmitted by our correspondent] This reporter, Shi Zhengyao, reports: There are nearly nine hundred amateur writing groups and more than thirty thousand amateur creators in Rongxian Prefecture, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, of which farmers account for 70%. Since the upsurge in agricultural production, mass literary creation has shown an unprecedentedly flourishing scene of a hundred flowers blooming and a thousand reds and purples. In the past three months or so, folk oral creations and written works have totaled more than 20,000. These works sing the praises of the Great Leap Forward in production, praise the beautiful socialist countryside, commend advanced figures, spread good experiences, and are loved by the masses. Several folk singers in Bobai County sing newly created folk songs on the streets every dusk. Many people gather around to listen. Every time they sing the most exciting part, the crowd sings a chorus together, and they don't disperse until late at night. When transplanting rice in the Old Gold Commune, the male commune members who carry seedlings and the female commune members who transplant rice sing folk songs to compete with each other, and they are reluctant to stop working until midnight.
    The Rongxian Prefectural Commissioner's Office of Culture recently announced the results of the evaluation and awards for outstanding works created by the masses since the second half of 1957. This will further promote folk literary creation. This time, there were 532 good works selected by various counties, more than double the number of works submitted in the previous year. These included more than a dozen literary forms such as folk songs, clapper talks, wooden fish tunes, Guinan tea-picking tunes, and living newspapers. The award-winning works included the novel "There is a Red Sun in the East," which praised the Party and Chairman Mao, and the folk song "Longjing Slope," which sang the superiority of agricultural cooperatives, among forty-two works. These works have clear political and ideological content, pure and true emotions, popular language, and are short and concise.
    Party and government leaders at all levels in this prefecture attach great importance to the cultivation of this folk literary creation team. Each county often holds meetings of amateur writers to study the guidelines, tasks, and policies of various periods; holds essay competitions and awards every year; organizes works exhibitions; publishes small literary publications; and introduces relevant reading materials to cultivate and improve them. Liang Huanguang, a farmer-author in Pingnan County, could only sing but not write in the past. Now he can not only write folk songs, but also write scripts. Farmer Deng Weiwu could not even write fluent sentences when he started writing in 1956, but now the folk song "Longjing Slope" he wrote won the second prize.

    百花盛开　千红万紫
    容县专区群众性文艺创作空前繁茂
    本报讯　记者施峥尧报道：广西僮族自治区容县专区有将近九百个业余创作组，三万多个业余创作者，其中农民占70％。自从掀起农业生产高潮以来，群众性的文艺创作，出现了百花齐放，万紫千红，空前繁茂的盛况。在最近三个多月里所产生的民间口头创作和文字作品，约计二万多篇。这些作品歌唱生产大跃进，咏诵美好的社会主义农村，赞扬先进人物，传播好经验，为千万人民群众所喜爱。博白县城的几个山歌手，每当黄昏就在街头唱起新创作的山歌，许多群众围听，每唱到最精彩的地方，群众就齐声唱起帮腔来，直到深夜才尽欢而散。旧金社在插秧时，挑秧的男社员和插秧的女社员，互唱山歌进行劳动竞赛，干到半夜还不肯收工。
    容县专署文化科最近公布了征集1957年下半年以来群众创作的优秀作品的评奖结果。这将进一步促进民间文艺创作。这次应征的有经过各县挑选过的五百三十二篇好作品，超过上一年度应征作品数量的一倍多。其中包括山歌、快板、木鱼调、桂南采茶调、活报剧等十几种文艺形式。获奖的有歌颂党和毛主席的小说“东方有个红太阳”、歌唱农业社的优越性的山歌“龙胫坡”等四十二个作品。这些作品有着鲜明的政治思想性，感情纯朴真实，语言通俗，短小精悍。
    这个专区的各级党政领导方面非常重视对这支民间文艺创作队伍的培养。各县经常以召开业余作者会议，学习各个时期的方针、任务和政策；每年举办征稿评奖；组织作品展览会；出版小型文艺刊物；介绍有关读物等办法，来培养提高他们。平南县农民作者梁焕光，过去只能唱不能写，现在不仅会编写山歌，还会写剧本。农民邓伟武在1956年开始写作时，连词句还写不通顺，而现在他写的山歌“龙胫坡”，获得了二等奖。
