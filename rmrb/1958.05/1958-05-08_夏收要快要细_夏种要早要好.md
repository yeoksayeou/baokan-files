Henan Shangqiu Prefecture Puts Forward Ten Specific Measures Early
	1. Launch a large-scale debate and mobilize the whole people; 2. Arrange agricultural work in order and prepare everyone; 3. Make arrangements for labor and livestock; 4. Rush to manufacture one million pieces of advanced tools; 5. Organize comprehensive cooperation; 6. Conduct wheat comparison and check preparation work; 7. Do a good job in wheat seed selection; 8. Mobilize the masses to protect wheat; 9. Harvest in a timely manner and thresh carefully; 10. Implement a continuous operation method of harvesting wheat while planting crops.

	(Our Newspaper's News) In order to welcome this year's bumper wheat harvest, the CCP Shangqiu Prefectural Committee of Henan Province decided to launch a mass debate throughout the region on how to do a good job in the summer harvest and summer planting, mobilizing the masses to do everything possible to ensure a great victory in the tense summer harvest and summer planting season.
	According to the current wheat growth situation, if there are no particularly serious disasters this year, the average yield per unit area of the more than 14 million mu of wheat in this prefecture will increase by about one time compared to last year. According to local plans, in order to ensure a good autumn harvest, during the tense summer harvest and summer planting season, the amount of fertilizer applied per mu of summer-sown crops in the entire prefecture this year will increase by nine times compared to the past, and 6 to 8 million mu of land will also be deeply ploughed. All kinds of summer-sown crops must be deeply ploughed to eliminate stubble. At this time, the 2 million mu of wheat stubble land prepared for conversion to paddy fields must also be leveled, soaked, and planted with rice seedlings. Therefore, this year's work in this tense summer harvest and summer planting season will be busier than in any previous year. In order to ensure a summer harvest and to plant late autumn crops well, laying a reliable foundation for the autumn harvest, the CCP Shangqiu Prefectural Committee held a county party secretary meeting at the end of last month and conducted a serious study, deciding to take the following ten measures:
	1. Launch a mass summer harvest and summer planting debate throughout the region immediately. The debate will mainly include: the great significance of doing a good job in summer harvest and summer planting to ensure a full-year harvest; the new situation and new tasks of this year's summer harvest and summer planting; is it better to prepare early or late, to harvest quickly and plant early, or to harvest slowly and plant late; how to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, returning every grain to the family; how to organize socialist cooperation, etc. Industrial and financial departments should also debate how to actively support the summer harvest and summer planting. It is required that every township and every commune can make everyone discuss and everyone offer ideas. Whether in cities or villages, cadres and the masses, from preparation to harvesting, from summer harvest to summer planting, must consistently carry out the method of debate, carry out a nationwide ideological mobilization through debate, and summarize the experience and lessons of previous years to improve understanding, overcome complacency, and achieve ideological leadership, with the whole party and the whole people mobilized to ensure the smooth progress of the summer harvest and summer planting.
	2. Immediately conduct a ranking of agricultural work, so that every commune formulates a plan, everyone prepares, and everything is arranged. All agricultural work that can be advanced should be advanced as much as possible to free up sufficient labor and time for summer harvest and summer planting. It is required that before the wheat harvest, all the base fertilizer needed for late autumn crops be transported to the fields, and that early autumn crops such as sorghum, corn, and cotton be thinned, treated for pests, weeded, and topdressed, as well as the management and preparation of wheat stubble sweet potatoes and late rice seedlings; vigorously store and conserve water to ensure a sufficient water source; and also make preparations for flood prevention and for the tools and warehouses for summer harvest and summer planting. Before the start of the summer harvest and summer planting, it should be ensured that there is no manure at home, no weeds in the fields, no pests on the crops, water is available in case of drought, and preparations are made for the arrival of the flood season.
	3. Conscientiously plan labor and livestock power, establish summer harvest and summer planting headquarters at all levels, organize shock brigades for搶收抢种 (qiang shou qiang zhong) in communes and teams, implement the method of "four guarantees and four fixings," which includes the secretary taking command, special personnel leading, county committees dividing and contracting townships, township cadres contracting communes, communes contracting teams, teams contracting plots of land, as well as fixing time, fixing tasks, fixing quality, and fixing work points. Government agencies, organizations, troops, and schools should also make plans to support the summer harvest and summer planting and sign support contracts with agricultural cooperatives.
	4. Fully mobilize the masses to contribute ideas and suggestions, and rush to manufacture one million pieces of advanced tools before the wheat harvest, so that every commune and team has improved Taiping carts, rubber-tired soil-pushing carts, and hand-cranked fast grinders, and every well and pond has water-lifting tools to reduce labor intensity and improve labor efficiency.
	5. Organize socialist cooperation between cities and villages, workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, and counties, townships, communes, and teams in a planned and led manner. All localities should hold meetings with the original cooperation zones as units, conduct consultations based on needs, the amount of labor and livestock power, the size of the task, and the early or late maturity of wheat, and formulate specific agreements on labor and livestock power support, tool support, and seed exchange.
	6. Carry out mass wheat comparison from bottom to top to further check and promote the preparation work for summer harvest and summer planting. Identify wheat varieties and summarize and exchange the typical experiences of large-scale wheat production that have emerged this year.
	7. Conscientiously select wheat seeds. Formulate seed selection plans at each level, select high-yielding varieties suitable for local growth according to local conditions, and popularize improved varieties.
	8. Mobilize the masses to do a good job in protecting wheat, ensuring no losses from wind and rain, no fires in the fields, and no theft during the day, and maintain good wheat harvesting order.
	9. Be sure to grasp the maturity period of wheat, harvest in a timely manner, harvest and thresh carefully, and return every grain to the family. According to calculations, this will allow the region's 14 million mu of wheat to yield an additional 70 million jin. Universally mobilize the masses to calculate the comparative accounts of careful harvesting and threshing versus rough harvesting. Vigorously promote field-based threshing grounds, do a good job in storage facilities, and achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing, and quick storage, prevent wheat from mildewing, and achieve a bumper harvest.
	10. Before the start of summer harvest and summer planting, make summer planting plans, universally promote the method of fixing four items to the field, including seeds, fertilizer, technology, and work points, and implement a continuous operation method of harvesting, fertilizing, plowing, leveling the ground, and sowing at the same time, and establish a strict responsibility system. For high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes, corn, and rice, designate special personnel to be responsible, organize professional teams, and guarantee planting, management, and a bumper harvest.
	In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, while carrying out summer harvest and summer planting preparations in a tense manner, all localities must also conscientiously strengthen the late-stage management of wheat and pay special attention to preventing wheat lodging.

    夏收要快要细　夏种要早要好
    河南商丘专区及早提出十项具体措施
    一、开展大辩论，全民大动员；二、农活大排队，人人作准备；三、作好劳畜力安排；四、抢制百万件先进工具；五、组织全面大协作；六、开展小麦评比，检查准备工作；七、作好小麦选种工作；八、发动群众护麦；九、适时收割、细收细打；十、实行边收麦边播种的流水作业方法。
    本报讯　为了迎接今年的小麦大丰收，中共河南省商丘地委决定在全区开展一次群众性的关于如何作好夏收夏种工作的大辩论，动员群众千方百计地保证在夏收夏种的紧张关头，打个大胜仗。
    根据目前小麦生长情况，今年，这个专区的一千四百多万亩小麦如果再无特别严重灾害，平均单位面积产量将比去年增加一倍左右。按照各地计划，为保证晚秋作物丰收，在紧张的夏收夏种季节，今年全专区的夏播作物每亩施肥量将比过去增加九倍，还要深翻土地六百至八百万亩，各种夏播作物都要作到深耕灭茬，二百万亩准备改作水稻田的麦茬地也要在这时整地、泡田和插秧。因而今年在这紧张的夏收夏种季节里，工作将比过去任何一年都繁忙。为了保证夏季丰收，并把晚秋作物种好，给秋季丰收打下可靠的基础，中共商丘地委会在上月底召开了县委书记会议，进行了认真的研究，决定采取以下的十项措施：
    一、在全区范围内立即开展一次群众性的夏收夏种大辩论。辩论内容主要包括：搞好夏收夏种对保证全年丰收的重大意义；今年夏收夏种的新情况和新任务；是早准备好，还是晚准备好，是快收早种，还是慢收迟种；怎样作到细收细打，颗粒还家：如何组织社会主义大协作等问题。在工业、财经等部门还要辩论如何积极支持夏收夏种。要求乡乡、社社都能作到人人发议论，个个出主意。不论城市、乡村，干部与群众，从准备到收割，从夏收到夏播，都要自始至终贯彻开展辩论的方法，通过辩论进行全民性的思想大发动，并总结历年来的经验教训，以提高认识，克服麻痹思想，达到思想作统帅，全党、全民大动员，保证夏收夏种顺利进行。
    二、立即进行农活大排队，作到社社订计划，人人作准备，事事有安排。凡能提前的农活，要尽量提前，给夏收夏种腾出足够的劳动力和时间。要求在麦收前，把晚秋作物所需的底肥全部运到地头，作好对高粱、玉米、棉花等早秋作物的定苗、治虫、锄草和追肥，以及麦茬红薯与晚稻秧苗的管理和准备；大力蓄水、保水，保证有充足的水源；还要作好防汛准备和夏收夏种的农具、仓库等准备。在夏收夏种开始前，达到家里无粪，地里无草，作物无虫，天旱有水，汛期到来有准备。
    三、认真作劳、畜力规划，层层建立夏收夏种指挥部，社、队组织抢收抢种突击队，实行书记挂帅，专人领导，县委分片包乡，乡干部包社，社包队，队包地块，以及定时间，定任务，定质量，定工分等“四包四定”办法。机关、团体、部队、学校也要作好支援夏收夏种的规划，与农业社订立支援合同。
    四、充分发动群众人人献计，个个献策，在麦收前抢制一百万件先进工具，使社社队队都有改良太平车、胶轮推土车和手摇快磨等，井井塘塘都有提水工具，以减轻劳动强度，提高劳动效率。
    五、有计划有领导地组织城市与乡村、工人与农民、工业与农业，县、乡、社、队之间的社会主义大协作。各地要以原协作区为单位，召开会议，根据需要和劳、畜力多少，任务大小与小麦成熟早晚等情况，进行协商，具体制订劳、畜力支援、工具支援和种籽调换等协议。
    六、自下而上开展群众性的小麦评比，进一步检查和促进夏收夏种准备工作。并鉴定小麦品种，总结交流今年出现的小麦大面积丰产典型经验。
    七、认真作好小麦选种。逐级制定选种计划，因地制宜地挑选适合本地生长的高产品种，普及良种。
    八、发动群众作好护麦工作，作到风雨无损失，场里无火灾，日间无偷盗，保持良好的麦收秩序。
    九、要切实掌握小麦成熟期，适时收割，细收细打，颗粒还家。根据计算，这样全区的一千四百万亩小麦，便能多收七千万斤。要普遍发动群众算细收细打与粗糙收割的对比账。大力提倡在田间造场，作好储存设备，做到快收快打快入库，防止小麦霉烂，实现丰产丰收。
    十、在夏收夏种开始前，要作好夏播计划，普遍推行种籽、肥料、技术、工分等四项固定到田的方法，实行边收割、边施肥、边翻地、边整地打畦、边播种的流水作业法，建立严格的责任制。对红薯、玉米、水稻等高产作物，都要确定专人负责，组织专业队，包种、包管理、保丰收。
    为了保证小麦丰收，各地在紧张进行夏收夏种准备工作的同时，还要认真加强小麦的后期管理，并特别注意防止小麦倒伏。
