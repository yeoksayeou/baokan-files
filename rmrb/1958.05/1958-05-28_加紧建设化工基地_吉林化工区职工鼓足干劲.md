Xinhua News Agency, Jilin, 27th. After seeing the news of the victorious closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, workers in the Jilin Chemical Zone unanimously expressed that they would more firmly implement the General Line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism in the future. They want to build the Jilin Chemical Zone into a chemical base for the comprehensive utilization of coal resources, and accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry and organic synthesis industry. In the past two days, leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers of various factories and construction sites have been excitedly reading and discussing the news of the closing of the meeting. They pointed out that the Party's General Line for building socialism is a guiding light and a huge force driving the progress of production and construction. The workers of the Jilin Fertilizer Plant have made full use of existing equipment and have increased the output of synthetic ammonia by 60% above the designed level; the reduction workshop of the Jilin Dyestuff Plant has adopted the latest technology to change intermittent production to continuous production, and the output of toluene has increased four times. The workers of the Chemical Zone also proposed that during the Second Five-Year Plan period, they should increase the variety of products from the current twenty-four to more than three hundred, greatly increase the production of chemical fertilizers, and produce a variety of chemical fibers; the output value should increase more than tenfold compared with this year; and various technical and economic indicators should reach advanced international levels. In order to achieve this goal, the workers building the Chemical Zone are building and expanding five chemical plants at an unprecedented speed.

In order to implement the central government's policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, the workers in the Chemical Zone are also very enthusiastic in supporting local construction. The Chemical Zone Design Branch has sent people to select sites for chemical plants in Jilin Province, collect materials, and prepare for engineering design. The calcium carbide workshop of the calcium carbide plant is currently training chemical industry personnel for more than a dozen provinces.

    加紧建设化工基地
    吉林化工区职工鼓足干劲
    新华社吉林27日电　吉林化工区职工看到中共八大第二次会议胜利闭幕的消息以后，一致表示今后要更加坚定地贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的建设社会主义的总路线，把吉林化工区建设成为一个综合利用煤炭资源的化工基地，加速发展化学肥料工业和有机合成工业。近两天，各工厂、工地的领导干部、工程技术人员和工人，兴奋地阅读和谈论着会议闭幕的消息。他们指出，党的建设社会主义的总路线是指路明灯，是推动生产建设前进的巨大力量。吉林肥料厂职工们充分利用现有设备，已经使合成氨的产量突破设计水平60％；吉林染料厂还原车间采用最新技术，将间断生产改为连续生产，甲苯的产量提高了四倍。化工区职工还提出，在第二个五年计划期间，他们要把产品品种由现在的二十四种增加到三百种以上，化学肥料要大大增产，而且要生产出多种化学纤维；产值比今年增长十倍以上；并且使各项技术经济指标达到国际先进水平。为了实现这一奋斗目标，建设化工区的职工们正在以前所未有的速度新建和扩建五个化工厂。
    为了贯彻中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针，化工区职工们支援地方建设的积极性也很高。化工区设计分院已经派人为吉林省建设化工厂选择厂址、收集资料、准备进行工程设计。电石厂电石车间目前也正在为十多个省培养化学工业人材。
