Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, May 22nd: The "People's Tribune" in Poland recently published an article entitled "On the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."

The article stated that the draft program of the South Communist Party, discussed at the Seventh Congress of the South Communist Party at the end of April this year, has aroused heated debate in the international workers' movement.

In addition to the issue of socialist construction in Yugoslavia, the draft program also included, as stated in the preface, "an analysis of the contradictions of the modern world, and defined the views and positions of the Yugoslav Communists on general issues of social, economic, and political relations in the world."

It is quite clear that it is not only the Yugoslav Communists who are interested in such issues. This is a matter for the entire international communist movement and all revolutionary workers' parties in the world. Therefore, we cannot but determine our attitude towards the views of the Yugoslav comrades on these issues.

Other countries' communist parties, including our own, have raised their criticisms and reservations about a series of arguments in the draft program. These reservations are reflected in the letter from our Party Central Committee to the Yugoslav comrades and in the article in the "People's Tribune" on April 23 this year. In view of the fundamental differences of opinion, the communist parties of various countries did not send delegations to the congress, but only observers, in order to avoid disputes in the congratulatory messages.

Shortly before the opening of the congress, the drafters of the program published a revised version of the draft program. They also considered some of the reservations of other parties.

However, it should be said that some important principles that have not been modified in the program, as well as some remarks made by the leaders of the South Communist Party during the discussion process and by those who participated in the congress debate, are contradictory to the views of other countries' communist parties (including our own). The criticism of individual arguments in the program by other countries' communist parties was regarded by the congress as interference in the internal affairs of the South Communist Party, although these issues have already involved communists from various countries.

Indeed, at the congress, some authoritative representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia tried to interpret some of the controversial formulations in a spirit closer to the views of other countries' communist parties, but at the same time, emotional and impatient tones appeared in the speeches at the congress due to the criticism of the draft program of the South Communist Party and the fact that some communist parties did not send delegations to participate in the meeting. The attitude of studying the issue was less to argue the essence of the issue and more to save face. All this shows that the Yugoslav comrades have not yet abandoned the memories of the past period. It should be known that after 1954, the relations between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia and other communist parties and socialist countries began to develop in a new and good direction.

It is difficult for us to finally clearly decide our attitude towards the South Communist Program, because the committee entrusted by the congress to work on the final draft of the program has not yet published the final version. Although we do not yet know how the Yugoslav comrades will clarify their views on the issues in dispute, since the Yugoslav Congress has already aroused international debate (the readers of the "People's Tribune" already know about some of the remarks in this debate), we believe that it is necessary to determine our attitude towards these issues before we know the final arguments of Yugoslavia.

Naturally, we are only talking about some international issues, because we believe that the Yugoslav Communists are the most qualified to speak on Yugoslavia's domestic issues.

The article said that although the Seventh Congress of the South Communist Party made revisions and explanations to the draft program, the draft program still contains a series of incorrect views on the existing problems of the international communist movement. These views are fully expressed throughout the draft program.

Undoubtedly, the most important issue is the attitude towards dividing the world into two major systems - the socialist system and the capitalist system.

The establishment of the socialist state system is a historically significant achievement of modern times. The struggle between the socialist system and the capitalist system is the main content of our era. The attitude towards this struggle, the attitude towards the socialist state system, determines the objective historical position of every political faction and every political party at present.

The article pointed out that, admittedly, the draft program also emphasized the historical role of the Soviet Union, which initiated the process of socialist transformation of the world revolution and became the fortress of all socialist countries and progressive forces. The draft states that "This great historical role of the communists can never be refuted and weakened by any slander from the enemies of socialism, or by any smear from opportunists, philistines, and petty-bourgeois chatterers." "Without this role of the communists, the world would not be what it is today, nor would it be what it is bound to be tomorrow."

Despite these words from the drafters of the program, they did not give due evaluation to the historical role of socialist countries, because they confused the issue of the two systems with the issue of military blocs, and did not point out the difference between treaties signed by imperialist countries and treaties signed by socialist countries, thus deviating from the class viewpoint.

Communist parties of various countries strive for peaceful competition between the two systems. Communist parties of various countries have consistently advocated easing international tensions and peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. We advocate the abolition of military blocs. However, there are two issues involved here: the first is the question of the reasons for the establishment of the two military blocs and the evaluation of the nature of the two major camps; and the second is the question of the unity of socialist countries.

We Poles still remember when the first seeds of the "Cold War" were sown. We still remember Churchill's speech in Fulton in 1946 and US Secretary of State Byrnes' speech in Stuttgart. In this speech, the German revisionists were first provided with arguments against Poland, claiming that the Polish-German border did not seem to be finally determined. West European communists clearly remember that the war had just ended, and US diplomats immediately tried to squeeze them out of the joint governments of various countries, where they had joined as outstanding figures in the anti-Hitler struggle.

The "Cold War" was caused by imperialism, first and foremost US imperialism, attempting to "reverse the wheel of history," restore capitalism in countries undergoing socialist revolution, and obstruct the communist movement in capitalist countries. The main root of the "Cold War" and the North Atlantic Treaty lies here, and this is the only decisive root. It is impossible to equate the policies of the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp with the policies of the imperialist countries. People cannot fail to see that in the face of the aggressive activities of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and its many member states, the socialist state camp, due to its unity and the adoption of peaceful policies aimed at easing international tensions, is now a powerful factor in peaceful coexistence, effectively crushing the plundering conspiracies of the imperialists (as in the Near East).

Any good wishes and verbal accusations, or unilateral hopes and demands, cannot achieve the goal of eliminating military blocs. Only when the tendency for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the two systems also prevails in the capitalist world can the abolition of military blocs be realized.

It is noteworthy that the South Communist Program's explanation of this issue is self-contradictory. On the one hand, they say that the North Atlantic Treaty is a "military bloc whose purpose is to establish world domination and achieve its goals by relying on its position of strength," and that "the formation of the North Atlantic Military Treaty and West Germany's accession to this treaty will undoubtedly inevitably lead Eastern European countries to organize the Warsaw Defense Treaty to resist the North Atlantic Treaty." But at the same time, they also say that "Because Stalin pursued a stubborn and unnecessarily threatening foreign policy, the Western powers saw that it was impossible to achieve their goals through diplomatic channels, and believed that they could only achieve their goals with a policy of strength. This is the basic reason for signing the North Atlantic Treaty."

Where exactly is the problem? What is the reason for signing the North Atlantic Treaty? Is it Stalin's policy, or is it the goal that the Western countries have always pursued, and which they have not been able to achieve in the past and cannot achieve now? US imperialism has not yet been willing to abandon these goals to this day. The South Communist Party's opposition to the expansion of armaments, the poisoning of the political atmosphere, the continuous pollution of the atmosphere by nuclear explosions, and the aggravation of international tensions are all correct. The root cause of all this lies in the policy of US imperialism, which has built its military bases around socialist countries, is now arming the West German army with atomic weapons, and is creating various new obstacles on the road to easing international tensions. Due to the stubborn veto of the United States, the Chinese people still do not have their own representatives in the United Nations.

However, the South Communist Program avoids mentioning this role of US imperialism in the modern world. This is a principled mistake. Because, without specifying the economic and military role of US imperialist forces in the current capitalist system, it is impossible to make a correct and comprehensive assessment of imperialism, and it is impossible to correctly explain the current international situation and the root causes of the current tensions.

The second issue is the unity of socialist countries.

The article pointed out that this unity is due to the consistency of ideology and class interests, and due to the consistency of the goals of all socialist countries. Because of this common point, it is necessary for socialist countries to be brothers and unite to cope with the threat from imperialism, and socialist countries and communist parties of various countries must cooperate and help each other.

When the 20th Congress of the CPSU discussed this issue, it believed that the unity of socialist countries was inseparable from the principles of complete equality between socialist countries and mutual respect for sovereignty. Our Party's Eighth Plenary Session determined its position based on these principles. The declaration of the twelve parties also reflects these Leninist principles.

The South Communist Program and some speeches at the Congress essentially oppose the sovereignty and equality of socialist countries to the cause of unity of the socialist camp countries. In the final analysis, such a position does not take into account the basic principles of international solidarity of all socialist countries.

The article said that the Yugoslav comrades emphasized that countries must build socialism according to their own specific conditions. This is correct. However, it must be remembered that there is another aspect of the issue, that is, the aspects proposed in the resolutions of our Party and the parties of other socialist countries and further elaborated in the declaration of the twelve parties, that is, the universal laws of the proletarian revolution that appear in different forms in various countries. This universal law is not something that anyone has dreamed up, but an objective law of reality, which means that no matter how prominent the national characteristics are, the main class forces, the main tasks of socialist construction are the same in all countries, the main contradictions that exist in this construction process are the same, and the class enemies we oppose are also common.

However, it should be pointed out that this point of view has not been adequately expressed in the South Communist Program we have seen.

Another important issue that we cannot agree with is the assessment of the phenomena occurring in the modern capitalist system in the draft program. The drafters of the South Communist Program emphasized what they called "state capitalism," and emphasized the growing role of the state and the state apparatus in the modern capitalist economy and politics. This is undeniable. However, the problem is that in many places in the draft program, there are contradictions in the assessment of the class nature of the state, which plays an increasing role in the modern capitalist economy. One place clearly and correctly talks about the capitalist nature of this country. But in other places, it is insisted that the bureaucracy and the collectives that perform certain functions in this state apparatus are separated from their class essence and are above class. The draft program states: "State institutions, in order to obtain their independent functions, often place themselves above society, and increasingly show a tendency to increasingly limit the role of private capital and the role of the working class."

This point of view cannot be agreed with. The entire development of capitalist world relations proves that the so-called acquisition of independence by the state apparatus in developed capitalist countries is not in line with reality. In reality, this machine "restricts" the working class rather than the capitalist class, and directs the spearhead of its class violence at the proletarian liberation movement. In these countries, if the state apparatus dares to take measures that are unfavorable to certain bourgeois groups, then it does so for the interests of the entire capitalist class, and first of all for the interests of the most powerful monopoly capital groups.

If we adopt the argument that the state apparatus of a bourgeois country is not dependent on the capitalist class, and can even restrict this class, then under certain conditions, it can become an ally of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie. Isn't this what social democrats and all kinds of reformists are shouting about, regardless of the entire historical experience of the workers' movement? Can we use unfounded, ambiguous definitions in this case? This definition gives social democrats weapons. It is painful that a lot of good things have been said about social democrats in the draft program.

The article pointed out that although the draft program has been revised, it has not answered the above-mentioned unclear questions: Who does the so-called independent bureaucracy in developed capitalist countries serve, and which social class does it serve in essence? How should the working class fighting for the seizure of power view the state machine? In all the documents of the South Communist Congress, the answer to this question is unclear, or even completely wrong.

Finally, there is the issue of fighting bureaucracy and the so-called withering away of the state, and we believe that the explanation of these issues in the draft program is incorrect.

At the same time, the South Communist Program particularly emphasizes the danger of bureaucratic abuses, the "bureaucratic state centralism," which weakens the connection between the people's government and the working masses, and promotes the activities of anti-socialist forces. However, the draft program obviously one-sidedly connects the phenomenon of bureaucracy with the form of central state management of the means of production. It must be pointed out that, as experience (including the experience of Yugoslavia) teaches, the danger of bureaucracy also arises under conditions of non-centralized economic management forms, as already pointed out in the letter from the South Communist Central Committee on February 6, 1958.

Poland and some other socialist countries are fighting against bureaucratic centralism and are developing a democratic form: enabling the working people to directly participate in the management of their own enterprises and the management of their towns and villages. But we do not believe that this will completely solve the problem of bureaucracy in socialist countries.

This problem can only be solved smoothly if the Party constantly conducts a resolute struggle against all kinds of bureaucracy, and strictly abides by the principles of democratic centralism and Leninism in its own ranks.

The article said that the South Communist Program holds the same one-sided view that bureaucracy can only be eliminated in the "process of the withering away of the state," and believes that the "process of the withering away of the state" is the decentralization of power, the weakening of the role of the state, and the expansion of the functions of social autonomous institutions. The South Communist Program states: "After the power of the working class and all the working people is consolidated, the question of the gradual withering away of the state becomes the basic and decisive issue of the socialist social system." The practice of directly linking the struggle against bureaucracy with the process of the withering away of the state is due to too narrow and too simplistic an understanding of the issue of the withering away of the state. The withering away of the state is gradual, and the state will wither away when the state is no longer necessary, and the economic functions performed by the state, as well as the functions of national defense and public security, have disappeared. As long as communist society has not yet been built, and as long as social productivity has not yet developed enough, the economic function of the state will still have its significance. Therefore, there must still be corresponding state organs to perform these tasks. The scope and form of activity of this organ can and should change with the development of socialist construction and productivity, so that the working people can increasingly directly participate in the management of economic and socialist enterprises.

As long as there are still social classes, and there are still antagonistic and non-antagonistic contradictions between classes, the function of class suppression or external defense will still exist. Therefore, there is a need for defense organs and coercive organs, although their scope of activity can and should be changed, and can be restricted if conditions permit. As for the necessity of preserving armed forces to defend against foreign aggression, perhaps there is no need to prove this to anyone in the current international situation.

Therefore, the process of the withering away of the state is first and foremost linked to the elimination of class differences and anti-socialist forces in society, that is, to the elimination of the function of class coercion, which is the essence of every state. It can be seen from this that this process is linked to the socialist transformation of the entire national economy, to the satisfaction of the material and cultural needs of society, and to the disappearance of bourgeois remnants in the people's ideology. This process also depends on the international environment of socialist countries, and depends on the decisive advantage of socialist countries over the capitalist system on the international stage. It can be seen that this process is a continuous, complex process involving many aspects.

It is by no means possible to confuse the decentralization of economic and administrative management power, the development of various forms of laboring people's autonomy (which undoubtedly has great significance for the struggle against bureaucracy) with the process of the withering away of the state. The withering away of the state is the replacement of the administration of people with the management of things, and the elimination of all state coercion in interpersonal relationships.

The current situation requires us to maintain state leadership in economic and social life and in other aspects, and to maintain the state's defense organs and coercive organs. Some of the incorrect arguments in the draft program are contrary to the actual situation in the South Communist Party, and these arguments blur the clear attitude that communists should hold on the issue of the role and status of state power.

The article said that it should be clearly stated that this view is not beneficial to our common goals. They will create ideological confusion in the ranks of the Communist Party, and will never help to strengthen the unity and cooperation of the communist parties of various countries, and to strengthen the unity and cooperation of all peaceful, democratic and socialist forces, the most important cause.

Some of the incorrect views mentioned here show that the South Communist Program has gone astray, although the program also contains many correct arguments that are the same as the positions of other countries' communist parties and workers' parties. Therefore, the answer to the following question is still the main issue at present, that is, how to eliminate the essential differences in ideology and political stance between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the communist parties and workers' parties of other countries, and how to establish cooperation between the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the communist parties of other countries, as well as cooperation between Yugoslavia and other socialist countries, on the basis of unwavering proletarian internationalism and common interests and common aspirations?

It is impossible to give a correct answer to the above questions without considering the actual situation and political practice of the recent period.

Yugoslavia was excluded from the socialist camp in 1948, and it is still outside this camp. Nor did it join the Warsaw Pact. However, Yugoslavia supports the peace initiatives of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. It supports the Soviet proposal to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. It supports the Rapacki Plan. Yugoslavia agrees with the position of the socialist countries on the German issue, recognizes the German Democratic Republic, a peace-loving socialist country, and has therefore had disputes with the West German government.

Yugoslavia's attitude towards the liberation struggles of the peoples of imperialist dependent countries is also well known, that is: supporting their freedom-loving aspirations and supporting the progressive, democratic and socialist forces in these countries.

Of course, this cannot be seen as an accidental phenomenon.

This practice in the activities of the Yugoslav Communists developed from the past Yugoslav communist movement.

Before World War II, the Yugoslav Communists carried out revolutionary activities under difficult conditions. The party was in a secret state when the Yugoslav dynasty was under fascist autocratic rule. During the war against the Hitler bandits, the Communists mobilized tens of thousands of loyal fighters to fight for the independence of the country and for solidarity with the Soviet Union.

After the failure of Hitler's rule, the Communists of Yugoslavia led the working class to begin building socialism in their own country.

In 1948, the Communists of Yugoslavia began to undergo a heavy test. They were unfairly isolated from the international communist movement. In this extremely difficult period, the Communists of Yugoslavia maintained the socialist nature of their country.

Of course, the struggle and activities of the Communists of Yugoslavia cannot be separated from the entire international situation.

The draft program of the South Communist Party also mentioned this:

"During the period between the two world wars, the very existence of the Soviet Union became the main pillar of all socialist and progressive movements in the world."

This is not only the case in the period between the two wars. It was also the case during World War II, when the family of socialist countries was formed and expanded and consolidated due to the Soviet Union's victory over Hitlerism. This is even more true in the post-war period.

The article pointed out that the heroic struggle of the Yugoslav people against the Hitler aggressors achieved final victory because it was a member of the great anti-Hitler alliance (and the Soviet Union was the decisive force in this alliance), because Hitler's main forces had been exhausted and defeated by the Soviet army.

The entire development of Yugoslavia in the post-war period was carried out in an environment of the continuous growth of socialist forces throughout the world. This growth of socialist forces, even during the period when relations between the socialist camp countries and Yugoslavia were tense, made it possible for the working class and the South Communist Party of this country to maintain their independence from imperialist aggression, and it was possible to continue to build a new socialist system.

The article said that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which grew up in the struggle for socialism and led the socialist construction of its own country, has common goals and common vital interests with us. This has given all of us, and also the Communists of Yugoslavia, a common obligation and a common responsibility. This responsibility is first manifested in: strengthening, not weakening, the world's socialist forces with action. This responsibility also lies in: strengthening, not weakening, the unity of the forces of peace in the anti-imperialist struggle, especially strengthening the unity of socialist countries on the basis of Leninist unity and equality.

This is especially important now, when US imperialists are intensifying the armament of the rapidly reviving West German army with atomic weapons, thereby creating a serious situation in Central Europe and aggravating the entire international situation. Socialist Yugoslavia was born in the struggle against German fascism. The recent rude behavior of the government of the Federal Republic of Germany towards Yugoslavia is another proof of the "ruling nation" spirit existing in West Germany. During World War II, Poland, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and other countries fought against it. This proves more convincingly than ever that solidarity and close cooperation between Yugoslavia and other socialist countries is necessary.

The conflicts that isolated Yugoslavia after 1948 harmed the cause of socialism, and only our enemies benefited. In order to correct the mistakes made against Yugoslavia, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union took the initiative to normalize Soviet-Yugoslav relations. This initiative of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union has been supported by all those who cherish socialism, internationalism, and human progress.

In 1948 and in the years that followed, our party also made serious mistakes against Yugoslavia. These mistakes also had harmful consequences for our party life. We have corrected these mistakes along with the international communist movement, and have drawn corresponding ideological and practical conclusions based on the analysis of these mistakes.

The mistakes and methods of that period will not be repeated.

We are all concerned about maintaining the results of the 1954 Soviet initiative and consolidating the results of the correct policies of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, with a view to eliminating the existing differences of opinion on the basis of Leninist principles. Our party hopes that the relationship between Yugoslavia and other socialist countries will be established on the basis of the interests of socialism.

With this kind of concern, we feel it is necessary to point out what we consider to be the incorrect aspects of the position of the Yugoslav comrades.

Ideological discussions cannot avoid issues of principle significance to the international workers' movement, and such discussions must be aimed at constantly caring about strengthening the forces of world socialism. This kind of discussion, further practical cooperation, and cooperation in the struggle for the peaceful coexistence of all peoples, for easing international tensions, and for economic cooperation (a necessary factor for the victorious construction of socialism) is the way to eliminate the ideological differences between the South Communist Party and the communist parties of other countries on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, to strengthen the unity of all communist parties and socialist countries, and thus to benefit peace and socialism.

### 波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章  评南共纲领和南共第七次代表大会

    波兰“人民论坛报”发表文章
    评南共纲领和南共第七次代表大会
    新华社华沙22日电　“人民论坛报”最近发表了一篇题为“关于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会”的文章。
    文章说，今年4月底在南共第七次代表大会上讨论的南共纲领草案，引起了国际工人运动中的热烈论战。
    纲领草案中除了南斯拉夫社会主义建设问题外，还包括有像纲领序言中所说的“对现代世界矛盾的分析，并确定了南斯拉夫共产党人对世界的社会、经济和政治关系一般问题的观点和立场。”
    十分明显，对这种问题感到兴趣的不仅是南斯拉夫共产党人。这是整个国际共产主义运动和世界上所有革命工人政党的事。因此，我们不能不确定自己对南斯拉夫同志在这些问题上的观点的态度。
    其他国家共产党，其中也包括我们的党，对纲领草案的一系列论点提出了自己的指责和保留。这些保留的意见反映在我们党中央委员会致南斯拉夫同志的信中和今年4月23日“人民论坛报”的文章中。鉴于意见的本质上的分歧，各国共产党没有派代表团出席代表大会，只派遣了观察员，这是为了不致在贺词中引起争论。
    在代表大会开幕前不久，纲领起草人曾公布了纲领草案的修正稿。他们也考虑了其他党的某些保留的意见。
    但是，应当说，纲领中没有修改的一些重要原则以及南共领导人在讨论过程中，和参加代表大会辩论的人的一些言论，同其他国家共产党（其中包括我们党）的观点是矛盾的。其他国家共产党对纲领的个别论点的批评被代表大会认为是对南共内部事务的干涉，尽管这些问题已经涉及到各国共产党人。
    的确，在代表大会上，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的一些有权威的代表曾经试图本着同其他国家共产党的观点比较接近的精神来解释一些发生争论的提法，但是同时在代表大会上的发言中又出现了因南共纲领草案遭到批评和一些共产党没有派代表团来参加会议而引起的感情用事的急躁语调，而研究问题的态度与其说是为了论证问题的实质，到不如说是为了要挽回威信。这一切说明，南斯拉夫同志直到现在还没有摒弃过去一段时期的回忆。要知道，在1954年以后，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫同其他共产党和社会主义国家之间的关系开始有了新的良好的发展。
    我们很难最后明确地决定自己对南共纲领的态度，因为受代表大会委托从事纲领草案定本工作的委员会还没有发表最后的定本。虽然我们还不知道南斯拉夫同志将如何澄清自己对争论的问题的看法，但是由于南斯拉夫代表大会已经引起了国际争论（关于这次争论中的某些言论，“人民论坛报”的读者已经都知道了），我们认为，有必要在得知南斯拉夫最后的论点以前就确定我们对这些问题的态度。
    自然，我们所谈的仅限于一些国际性的问题，因为我们认为在南斯拉夫的国内问题上，最有资格说话的是南斯拉夫共产党人。
    文章说，尽管南共第七次代表大会对纲领草案作了修正和说明，纲领草案仍然含有一系列对有关国际共产主义运动的现存问题的不正确观点。这些观点在整个纲领草案中充分地表现了出来。
    无疑地，其中最重要的问题是对世界划分为两大体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系的态度问题。
    社会主义国家体系的建立是现代有历史意义的成就。社会主义体系和资本主义体系的斗争是我们时代的主要内容。对这一斗争的态度、对社会主义国家体系的态度在目前决定每一个政治派别和每一个政党的客观历史地位。
    文章指出，诚然，纲领草案也强调指出了苏联的历史作用，它开创了世界革命的社会主义改造的过程，并且成为一切社会主义国家和进步力量的堡垒。草案中谈到“共产党人的这一伟大历史作用，决不是社会主义敌人的任何诽谤，机会主义者、市侩和小资产阶级清谈家的任何污蔑所可以驳倒和削弱的”。“没有共产党人的这种作用，世界就不会是今天这样的世界，也不会成为明天必然那样的世界。”
    尽管纲领草案的起草人说了这些话，可是他们对于社会主义国家的历史作用并未给予应有的评价，因为他们把两个体系问题同军事集团问题混为一谈，而且也没有指出帝国主义国家签订的条约同社会主义国家签订的条约之间的区别，因此，这就离开了阶级观点。
    各国共产党力求两个体系展开和平竞赛。各国共产党一贯主张缓和国际紧张局势，主张不同社会制度的国家和平共处。我们主张取消军事集团。但是，这里牵涉到两个问题：第一是关于两个军事集团成立的原因和对两大阵营性质的评价问题；第二是关于社会主义国家的团结问题。
    我们波兰人还记得第一批“冷战”种子是何时撒下的。我们还记得1946年丘吉尔在富尔敦的演说和美国国务卿贝尔纳斯在斯图加特的演说。在这次演说中，第一次给德国的修改疆界分子提供了所谓波德边界似乎还没有最后确定的反对波兰的论据。西欧共产党人清楚地记得，战争刚刚结束，美国外交人士马上就竭力把他们排挤出各国联合政府，他们原来是以反希特勒斗争的杰出人物的身份加入联合政府的。
    “冷战”是帝国主义、首先是美帝国主义企图“扭转历史车轮”，使资本主义在进行社会主义革命的国家复辟和阻挠资本主义国家的共产主义运动而造成的。“冷战”和北大西洋公约的主要根源就在这里，这是唯一的决定性的根源。决不能把苏联和整个社会主义阵营的政策同帝国主义国家的政策等量齐观。人们不能不看到，在面临北大西洋公约组织和它的许多成员国的侵略活动的情况下，社会主义国家阵营由于团结一致和采取了目的在于缓和国际紧张局势的和平政策，现在已经是和平共处中的一个强有力的因素，它有效地粉碎了帝国主义者的掠夺阴谋（像在近东那样）。
    任何良好愿望和口头指责，或者单方面的希望和要求都不能达到消除军事集团的目的。只有在资本主义世界中也是两个体系和平共处和和平竞赛的倾向占上风的时候，取消军事集团才能实现。
    南共纲领对这个问题的解释自相矛盾，这一点是值得注意的。他们一方面说，北大西洋公约是“军事集团，其目的是凭借实力地位建立世界统治和达到自己的目的”，说“北大西洋军事公约的形成和西德加入这个公约无疑地必然导致东欧国家为抵制北大西洋公约而组织华沙防御条约”。但是，同时他们又说，“由于斯大林执行顽固和不必要的威胁性外交政策，西方大国看到，不可能靠外交途径达到自己的目的，就以为只有用实力政策才能达到自己的目的。这是签订北大西洋公约的基本原因”。
    问题究竟在哪里呢？签订北大西洋公约的原因是什么呢？是斯大林的政策呢，还是西方国家一直所追求的、过去和现在都不能实现的目的呢？美国帝国主义直到今天还不肯放弃这些目的。南共反对扩充军备、反对毒化政治气氛、反对不断进行核爆炸对大气的污染、反对加剧国际紧张局势，这些做法都是正确的。这一切的祸根正就在于美国帝国主义的政策，美国帝国主义在社会主义国家四周建筑了自己的军事基地，现在用原子武器武装西德军队，在缓和国际紧张局势的道路上造成种种新的障碍。由于美国顽固地否决，中国人民在联合国还没有自己的代表。
    但是，南共纲领草案却对美国帝国主义在现代世界的这种作用避而不谈。这是原则性的错误。因为，如果不具体说明美国帝国主义势力在现在资本主义制度里的经济方面和军事方面起着什么作用，就不能对帝国主义作出正确的和全面的估计，就不能正确地阐明目前的国际局势和目前紧张局面的根源。
    第二个问题是社会主义国家团结的问题。
    文章指出，这种团结是由于意识形态和阶级利益的一致，由于一切社会主义国家的目标的一致。由于这个共同点，就使社会主义国家必须做到兄弟团结一致以应付来自帝国主义的威胁，社会主义国家和各国共产党必须合作和互助。
    苏共二十次代表大会讨论这个问题时认为，社会主义各国团结一致是同社会主义各国之间完全平等及互相尊重主权的原则密不可分的。我党第八次全会就是根据这些原则确定了自己的立场。十二国党的宣言也反映了这些列宁主义的原则。
    南共纲领草案和代表大会上的某些发言，实质上把社会主义国家的主权和平等同社会主义阵营国家的团结事业对立起来，归根结蒂，这样的立场没有考虑到所有社会主义国家国际团结的基本原则。
    文章说，南斯拉夫的同志们强调，各国必须根据本国的特殊条件建设社会主义。这是正确的。但是，必须记住问题的另外一面，即我们的党和其他社会主义国家的党的决议中提出的、并在十二国党的宣言中得到进一步详尽发挥的方面，这就是在各国以不同形式出现的无产阶级革命的普遍规律。这种普遍规律不是谁空想出来的，而是现实的客观规律，这就是说不论民族特点如何突出，主要阶级力量、社会主义建设的主要任务在各国都是一样的，在这一建设过程中所存在的主要矛盾是相同的，我们所反对的阶级敌人也是共同的。
    但是，应当指出，这一观点在我们所看到的南共纲领草案中并没有得到相应的表现。
    我们不能同意的另一个重要问题，是纲领草案对现代资本主义制度中发生的现象的估价。南共纲领草案起草人着重提到他们所谓的“国家资本主义”，着重提到国家和国家机器在现代资本主义经济和政治中的作用的增长。这是无可辩驳的。但是，问题在于，纲领草案中的很多地方对于在资本主义现代经济中起着日益增长的作用的那个国家的阶级性质的估价有矛盾。有一个地方清楚而正确地谈到了这个国家的资本主义性质。但在另一些地方则硬说，官僚政治和在这个国家机器中执行一定职责的集体脱离了自己的阶级本质而超乎阶级之上。纲领草案中说：“国家机构，为获得其独立职能，往往把自己置于社会之上，并且日益表现出其日益限制私人资本作用和工人阶级作用的倾向。”
    对这个观点是不能同意的。资本主义世界关系的整个发展证明，所谓国家机器在发达的资本主义国家中获得独立性这种说法是不符合实际情况的。实际上，这个机器是“限制”工人阶级而不是限制资本家阶级，并使自己的阶级暴力的矛头对准无产阶级的解放运动。在这些国家里，如果国家机器敢于采取不利于某些资产阶级集团的措施，那么，它这样做也是为了整个资本家阶级的利益，首先是为了最有势力的垄断资本集团的利益。
    如果采纳以下论点，即资产阶级国家的国家机器不依赖资本家阶级，甚至可以限制这个阶级，那么，在一定条件下，它就可以成为无产阶级反对资产阶级的同盟者。社会民主党人和各式各样的改良主义者不正是不顾工人运动的整个历史经验也这样叫嚷吗？是否可以在这种情况下利用没有事实根据的、模棱两可的定义呢？这种定义给了社会民主党人以武器。在纲领草案中关于社会民主党人说了很多好话，这是令人痛心的。
    文章指出，纲领草案虽然经过修改，但是并没有对上述不明确的问题作出答复：在发达的资本主义国家中所谓独立的官僚政治为谁、实质上为哪个社会阶级服务？为夺取政权而斗争的工人阶级应怎样看待国家机器？在南共代表大会的全部文件中，对这个问题阐述得不明确，甚至完全是错误的。
    最后，还有同官僚主义作斗争的问题和所谓国家消亡问题，我们认为纲领草案对这些问题的阐述是不正确的。
    同时，在南共纲领草案中特别着重谈到官僚主义弊端的危险性，谈到“官僚国家集权主义”，它削弱人民政权和劳动群众的联系，助长反社会主义势力的活动。但是，纲领草案显然片面地把官僚主义现象同中央集权国家对生产资料的管理形式联系起来。必须指出，正如经验（其中也包括南斯拉夫的经验）所教导的，官僚主义危险也产生在非中央集权的经济管理形式条件下，1958年2月6日南共中央的信中已经指出这点。
    波兰和一些其他社会主义国家正在同官僚集权主义进行斗争，并在发展一种民主形式：使劳动人民直接参加管理自己的企业，管理自己的城镇和乡村。但是我们并不认为，这样就能彻底解决社会主义国家中的官僚主义问题。
    只有在党经常同各种官僚主义进行坚决的斗争的情况下，在自己队伍中严格遵守民主集中制和列宁主义准则的情况下，才能顺利地解决这个问题。
    文章说，南共纲领草案抱着同样片面的态度认为只有在“国家消亡的过程中”才能消灭官僚主义，并且认为“国家消亡的过程”就是权力下放、削弱国家的作用和扩大社会自治机构的职能。南共纲领草案说：“在工人阶级和全体劳动人民的政权巩固后，国家逐步消亡的问题就成为社会主义社会制度基本的和具有决定意义的问题了。”把反官僚主义斗争同国家消亡的过程直接接合的做法，是由于对国家消亡问题的理解太狭隘、太简单化了。国家的消亡是逐渐的，等到国家已经没有存在的必要，国家所执行的经济职能以及国防和公安的职能已经消失的时候，国家才会消亡。只要共产主义社会还没有建成，只要社会生产力还发展得不够，国家的经济职能就还有它的意义。因此，还必须有相应的国家机关来执行这些任务。这个机关的活动范围和形式可以、而且应该随着社会主义建设和生产力的发展而变化，使劳动人民越来越多地直接参加管理经济和社会主义企业。
    只要还有社会阶级，还有阶级之间的对抗性矛盾和非对抗性矛盾，阶级镇压或对外防御的职能也就仍然存在。因此就需要防御机关和强制机关，虽然它们的活动范围可以、而且也应当改变，条件许可的话也可以加以限制。至于保存武装力量以防御外来侵略的必要性，在目前的国际局势下也许是对谁也用不着加以证明的。
    因此，国家消亡的过程首先同社会上阶级差别和反社会主义势力的消灭联系在一起，即同作为每个国家实质的阶级强制职能的消灭联系在一起。由此可见，这一过程是同整个国民经济的社会主义改造、同满足社会的物质和文化的需求、同人民思想意识中的资产阶级余毒的消逝联系在一起的。这一过程也取决于社会主义国家的国际环境，取决于社会主义国家在国际舞台上对资本主义体系的决定性优势。可见，这一过程是一个连续的、牵涉到许多方面的复杂的过程。
    决不能把经济和行政管理的权力下放，发展各种形式的劳动人民自治（这无疑地对反官僚主义斗争具有重大意义）同国家消亡的过程混为一谈。国家消亡是以对事情的管理代替对人的施政，是消灭人与人关系上的一切国家强制。
    目前的局势要求我们保持在经济和社会生活的其他方面的国家领导，保持国家的国防机构和强制机构。纲领草案的某些不正确论点是与南共的实际情况相违背的，这种论点模糊了共产党人在国家政权的作用和地位问题上所应当抱的明确态度。
    文章说，应当明确地说，这种观点对我们的共同目的是没有好处的。它们会在共产党的队伍中制造思想混乱，而决不会有助于加强各国共产党的团结和合作，加强所有和平、民主和社会主义力量的团结和合作这一最重要的事业。
    这里提到的一些不正确的观点说明南共纲领走上了邪道，虽然纲领中也有许多同其他国家共产党和工人党的立场相同的正确论点。因此，对下列问题的回答依然是目前的主要问题，即如何消除南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同其他国家的共产党和工人党在思想体系和政治立场上的本质分歧，如何在坚定不移的无产阶级国际主义和共同利益、共同愿望的基础上，建立南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟同其他国家共产党之间的合作，以及南斯拉夫同其他社会主义国家之间的合作？
    如果不考虑最近一个时期的实际情况和政治实践，就不可能对上述问题作出正确的回答。
    南斯拉夫是在1948年被排除出社会主义阵营的，它现在仍置身于这个阵营之外，它也没有参加华沙条约。但是，南斯拉夫支持苏联和其他社会主义国家的和平倡议。它支持苏联关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议。它支持腊帕茨基计划。南斯拉夫同意社会主义国家在德国问题上的立场，承认德意志民主共和国这个爱好和平的社会主义国家，并因而同西德政府发生了争执。
    南斯拉夫对帝国主义附属国人民的解放斗争的态度也是众所周知的，那就是：支持他们的爱好自由的愿望，支持这些国家进步的、民主的和社会主义的力量。
    当然，这不能看做是偶然的现象。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者活动中的这种实践是从过去南斯拉夫共产主义运动中发展来的。
    南斯拉夫共产党人在第二次世界大战以前在困难的条件下进行了革命活动，党是处在秘密的状态，当时正是南斯拉夫王朝法西斯专横统治的时候。在跟希特勒强盗的战争期间，共产党人动员了成千上万的忠心耿耿的战士，为国家的独立和同苏联的团结而斗争。
    希特勒统治失败以后，南斯拉夫的共产党人领导工人阶级开始在本国建设社会主义。
    1948年，南斯拉夫共产党人开始经受了沉重的考验，他们被不公平地同国际共产主义运动隔离开。在这一极端困难的时期，南斯拉夫的共产党人保持住了自己国家的社会主义性质。
    当然，不能把南斯拉夫共产党人的斗争和活动同整个国际局势分割开来。
    南共纲领草案也提到了这一点：
    “在两次世界大战之间这个时期内，苏联存在本身这件事情，成为世界上一切社会主义的和进步的运动的主要支柱。”
    不仅两次战争之间的这一时期如此。在第二次世界大战时期也是如此，当时由于苏联战胜了希特勒主义而形成了社会主义国家的大家庭，并使这个大家庭得到扩大和巩固。战后时期更是如此。
    文章指出，南斯拉夫人民反抗希特勒侵略者的英勇斗争之所以取得最后胜利，是因为它是伟大的反希特勒同盟中的一个成员（而苏联是这个同盟中的决定性的力量），是因为希特勒的主要力量已经被苏联军队打得筋疲力尽，被苏联军队击溃了。
    战后时期南斯拉夫的整个发展都是在全世界社会主义力量不断增长的环境中进行的，社会主义力量的这种增长甚至在社会主义阵营国家同南斯拉夫的关系处于紧张状态的时期，也使得这个国家的工人阶级和南共有可能维护自身的独立免受帝国主义侵略，并且有可能继续建设新的社会主义制度。
    文章说，在争取社会主义的斗争中成长起来的、领导着本国的社会主义建设的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟，同我们有着共同的目标和共同的切身利益。这就交给了我们所有的人，也交给了南斯拉夫共产党人以共同的义务和共同的责任。这种责任首先表现在：要以行动来加强、而不是削弱世界社会主义力量。这种责任还在于：要加强、而不是削弱和平力量在反帝斗争中的团结一致，特别是要在列宁主义的团结一致和平等的原则的基础上加强社会主义国家的团结。
    现在，正当美帝国主义者加紧以原子武器武装迅速复活中的西德军队，从而在中欧造成严重的局势并使整个国际局势紧张化的时候，这一点显得特别重要。社会主义的南斯拉夫是在反对德国法西斯的斗争中诞生的。德意志联邦共和国政府最近时期对南斯拉夫的粗暴行为是西德存在“统治民族”精神的又一个证明，在第二次世界大战期间，波兰、南斯拉夫、苏联和其他国家都曾同它进行过斗争。这比任何时候都令人信服地证明，南斯拉夫同其他社会主义国家的团结和亲密合作是必要的。
    使南斯拉夫在1948年以后陷于孤立的冲突给社会主义事业带来了危害，得到好处的只是我们的敌人。为了纠正对南斯拉夫所犯的错误，苏联共产党首先主动使苏、南关系正常化。苏联共产党和苏联的这个主动得到一切珍视社会主义、国际主义和人类进步的人们的支持。
    在1948年和以后的几年中，我们的党也对南斯拉夫犯了严重的错误。这些错误对我们的党内生活也产生了有害后果。我们同国际共产主义运动一起纠正了这些错误，并根据对这些错误的分析，作出了相应的思想结论和实践结论。
    过去那个时期的错误和方法不会再重演了。
    我们大家都很关心维护1954年苏联主动的成果和巩固苏共二十次代表大会正确政策的成果，以期在列宁主义原则的基础上消除现存的观点分歧。我们的党希望，南斯拉夫和其他社会主义国家的关系建立在符合社会主义利益的基础上。
    本着这种关怀的心情，我们感到有必要指出我们所认为的南斯拉夫同志的立场中不正确的地方。
    意识形态方面的讨论不能回避对国际工人运动具有原则意义的问题，这种讨论必须是为了不断关怀加强世界社会主义的力量。这种讨论，进一步实际的合作，以及在争取各国人民和平共处、争取缓和国际紧张局势、争取经济合作（胜利建设社会主义所必须的因素）的斗争中的合作，这是在马克思列宁主义基础上消除南共同其他国家共产党在意识形态方面的分歧的途径，是加强所有共产党和社会主义国家的团结，从而有利于和平与社会主义的途径。
