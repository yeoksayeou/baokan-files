Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th: More than a thousand leading cadres above the level of county (city) committees in Hubei Province have already established or are about to establish writing groups, with the First Secretary serving as the group leader.

The writing groups organized by Party committees at all levels will write articles of various forms based on the problems or experiences discovered in their work, and publish them in local newspapers and periodicals to guide practical work. After research and selection by the group, good articles with accuracy, clarity, and vividness will be recommended to the provincial Party committee, provincial newspaper, and publishing organs. Under the circumstances of the heavy workload of leading cadres, this kind of group is a feasible method for cultivating "red scholars," because they are writing while working, and writing does not add much burden.

The writing groups in various regions were established after the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee proposed the initiative to Party committees at all levels, based on the experience of the writing group led by Wang Renzhong, the First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee. The writing group led by Wang Renzhong has been writing articles for newspapers and magazines for several years. They have used the weapon of essays to write many lively, sharp, and profound articles on political and ideological issues in different periods, becoming a powerful assistant in guiding practical work.

    培养红色秀才的有效方法
    湖北县委以上领导干部成立写作小组
    新华社武汉4日电　中共湖北省各地委、县（市）委以上的领导干部一千几百人，已经或即将分别成立写作小组，并由第一书记担任小组长。
    各级党委组织的写作小组，将把工作中发现的问题或经验写成各种体裁的文章，在地方报刊上发表，以指导实际工作；并经过小组研究和挑选，把具备准确、鲜明、生动三性的好文章，向省委、省报、出版机关推荐。在领导干部工作繁忙的情况下，这种小组是培养红色秀才的一种可行方法，因为，他们是边工作边写作，写作并不增加很多负担。
    各地写作小组，是中共湖北省委宣传部根据省委第一书记王任重领导的写作小组的经验，向各级党委提出倡议之后建立的。王任重领导的写作小组，为报刊、杂志写文章已经有几年的历史，他们用杂文这一武器，对不同时期的政治思想问题写了很多生动活泼尖锐深刻的文章，成为指导实际工作的一个有力助手。
