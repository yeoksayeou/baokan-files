    Chinese Drama Shines Again in Paris
    By our correspondent Tan Wenrui
    Our drama and song and dance art have once again captivated Paris with its extraordinary charm. The China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater's debut performance at the Paris International Theatre Festival was warmly praised and applauded by French public opinion, and was considered the most successful performance since the festival began on March 25. The "France Soir," the most widely circulated newspaper in Paris, headlined its report on the performance with the bold title: "Beijing Opera Conquers Parisian Audiences." Judging from the sensation caused by the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater's debut performance, this statement is not an exaggeration. Three years ago, the Chinese Art Troupe brought the dramatic art of New China to Western audiences for the first time at the previous Paris Theatre Festival, which shocked Paris and other Western European countries. That successful performance not only opened the eyes of French audiences and aroused their strong interest in Chinese dramatic art, but also had a considerable impact on French cultural life. Since then, Chinese dramatic art has become a frequently discussed topic in French literary and art circles. The general public is even more eager to see the rich and colorful Chinese drama again.

    Conquering Parisian Audiences
    The news of our artists participating in this year's International Theatre Festival had long been spread in Paris as good news. All the tickets for the eight performances staged by the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater during the festival were sold out within a few days after they went on sale. Many viewers had to wait for the opportunity to enjoy the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater's tour after the end of the theatre festival. It is worth mentioning that on the day the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater arrived in Paris, although it was a holiday for Parisians and it was after 10 o'clock at night, there were still hundreds of enthusiastic welcomers waiting at the station to pay tribute to the Chinese artists.

    Just after 9:00 p.m. on April 29, the most famous Sarah Bernhardt Theatre in Paris was filled with people from French political, literary, and artistic circles. Many women also specially wore Chinese-style evening dresses to show their goodwill and affection for China. At 9:25, the theatre played the national anthems of the People's Republic of China and France, and the audience stood up solemnly. From the solemn and joyful expressions on the faces of many French friends, it can be seen how excited they were to hear the Chinese national anthem for the first time in their country. Julien, the organizer of the Paris International Theatre Festival and the manager of the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre, warmly congratulated the leaders of the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater after the performance, saying: "I sincerely congratulate you on your success, and I am deeply pleased that my theatre was the first in France to play your country's national anthem." Julien's short sentence reflects the deep friendship of the broad French people for the Chinese people.

    Artistic Language, Heart to Heart
    The drama and song and dance program began, with the Kunqu opera "The Gift of the Sword" with singing and dancing, the poetic and humorous lyrical comedy "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," the martial arts drama "Sizhou City" and "Wohu Gully" that wonderfully integrated martial arts dance and drama, the simple and beautiful folk dances "Flower Drum Lantern" and "Dragon Dance," and the performance of erhu and other folk musical instruments. Every program was warmly welcomed by the entire audience. After the end of some programs, the actors had to take bows eight or nine times to respond to the audience's incessant applause and cheers. This time, in order to give the French audience a more comprehensive understanding of Chinese drama, the Chinese artists specially selected some repertoires that could express various artistic characteristics of Chinese drama, not only the wonderful martial arts scenes, but also the exquisite singing and acting skills, and especially introduced Kunqu Opera, the oldest and most elegant Chinese opera genre, to the Parisian audience for the first time. Some people once worried: Due to the language barrier and the disparity in traditional customs, would some things be difficult for the French audience to accept? Facts have proved that this concern is completely superfluous. During the performance of the entire program on the evening of the 29th, people could see how the audience was attracted like a magnet by every move of the actors on the stage from beginning to end. Although they could not understand every line of singing and dialogue, and the musical tunes were so unfamiliar to them, their emotions closely followed the development of the plot, experiencing joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness. When the water sprite in "Sizhou City," who loved freedom, bravely fought alone against the many heavenly generals, the whole audience held their breath; when the water sprite won the victory, thunderous applause immediately rang out. When Sun Yujiao, who was innocent and lively in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," delicately expressed her true feelings of first love, the audience was completely immersed in a poetic realm, while Grandma Liu's kind jokes and humorous performances aroused bursts of laughter. When the agile giant dragon danced in the hazy clouds with dazzling fireballs, the audience constantly expressed their surprise, admiration, and joy with warm applause. The language of art completely communicated people's hearts.

    Cultural Exchange, Victorious Start
    After all the programs were over, the entire staff of the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater walked off the stage to meet the audience, and applause and cheers resounded throughout the theater for a long time. A stage worker who had worked at the Sarah Bernhardt Theatre for many years said to our actors: "Not many troupes can win such strong enthusiasm from Parisian audiences!" In this way, the China National Opera and Dance Drama Theater has victoriously begun its mission of cultural exchange in Western Europe.

    中国戏剧在巴黎再放异采
    本报记者　谭文瑞
    我国的戏剧和歌舞艺术以它非凡的魅力再一次风靡了巴黎。中国戏曲歌舞团在巴黎国际戏剧节的首次演出，受到了法国舆论的热烈赞扬和喝彩，被认为是本届国际戏剧节自3月25日开始以来最成功的演出。巴黎销路最广的“法兰西晚报”在报道这次演出的消息中，冠以大字的标题：“北京歌剧征服了巴黎的观众”。从中国戏曲歌舞团首次演出所引起的轰动来看，这种说法并不是夸张。三年前中国艺术团在巴黎上一届戏剧节第一次把新中国的戏剧艺术带给西方的观众，当时就曾震动了巴黎和西欧其他国家。那一次成功的演出不仅打开了法国观众的眼界，激发起他们对中国戏剧艺术的浓厚兴趣，而且对于法国的文化生活也起了不少的影响。从那个时候起，中国戏剧艺术就成为法国文艺界经常讨论的主题。广大公众更是渴望再一次看到丰富多采的中国戏剧。
    征服了巴黎的观众
    我国艺术家参加本届国际戏剧节的消息，早就在巴黎被当作一个喜讯传开了。而中国戏曲歌舞团在戏剧节期间上演八场的全部剧票，在开始出售后几天之内就被抢购一空，许多观众只好等待中国戏曲歌舞团在结束了戏剧节的演出后进行巡回演出的时候，再争取欣赏的机会了。值得一提的是，中国戏曲歌舞团到达巴黎的那天，虽然是巴黎人的休息日，而且又是在夜间十时以后，但是还是有好几百热情的欢迎者守候在车站，向中国的艺术家致意。
    4月29日晚上九点刚过，巴黎最著名的萨拉伯纳尔剧院中就已坐满了法国政界、文学界和艺术界的人士。许多妇女还特意穿上了中国式样的晚服，表示她们对中国的善意和好感。九点二十五分，剧场奏起了中华人民共和国和法国的国歌，全场观众肃然起立。从许多法国朋友脸上显现出的那种庄严而愉快的表情可以看出，他们在自己国土上第一次听到中国的国歌是何等的兴奋。巴黎国际戏剧节的组织者、萨拉伯纳尔剧院的经理茹里安，在演出结束后，热情向中国戏曲歌舞团的领导人们道贺，他说：“我衷心祝贺你们的成功，同时我深为我的剧院能够在法国最先奏起贵国的国歌而感到高兴。”茹里安的这句简短的话，反映了广大的法国人民对中国人民深切的友好感情。
    艺术语言　心心相印
    戏剧和歌舞的节目开始了，载歌载舞的昆曲“赠剑”，富有诗意和风趣的抒情喜剧“拾玉镯”，武功舞蹈和戏剧美妙地溶为一体的武戏“泗州城”和“卧虎沟”，纯朴而优美的民间舞蹈“花鼓灯”和“龙舞”，还有二胡和其他民间器乐的演奏，每一个节目都受到全体观众的热烈欢迎。有些节目结束以后，演员们不得不谢幕八九次来回答观众们不肯停息的掌声和欢呼。中国的艺术家们这次为了要使法国观众对中国的戏剧获得一个比较全面的认识，特意挑选了一些能够表现中国戏剧各种艺术特征的剧目，不仅有美妙的武打戏，也有艺术精湛的唱工戏和做工戏，特别第一次把中国最古老而高雅的剧种昆曲介绍给巴黎的观众。有人曾经担心：由于语言的隔阂和传统习惯的悬殊，有一些东西是否会不易为法国观众所接受呢？事实证明，这种担心完全是多余的，在29日晚上的全部节目演出的过程中，人们可以看到，观众是如何自始至终被舞台上演员们的一举一动像磁铁般地吸引着。尽管他们听不懂每一句唱词和道白，音乐曲调对于他们又是如此的陌生，但是他们的感情却紧紧地随着剧情的发展而喜怒哀乐。当“泗州城”中爱慕自由的水母英勇地独力奋战众天将的时候，全场屏息无声；当水母获得了胜利的时候，又马上响起了如雷的掌声。当“拾玉镯”中天真活泼的孙玉姣细腻地表达她初恋的真情的时候，观众完全陶醉在如诗一般的境界里，而刘妈妈善意的谐谑和幽默的表演，却引起一阵一阵的笑声。当矫捷的巨龙在迷茫的云雾中随着眩目的火球飞舞时，观众就不断地用热烈的鼓掌来表达他们的惊愕、赞叹和喜悦。艺术的语言完全沟通了人们的心灵。
    文化交流　胜利开始
    全部节目演毕以后，中国戏曲歌舞团的全体人员走出舞台和观众们相见，掌声和欢呼声响彻了整个剧场，历久不息。一位在萨拉伯纳尔剧院工作多年的舞台工作者对我们的演员说：“并不是许多剧团都能够赢得巴黎观众这样强烈的热情呀！”中国戏曲歌舞团就这样胜利地开始了他们这次在西欧的文化交流的使命。　　（5月1日）
