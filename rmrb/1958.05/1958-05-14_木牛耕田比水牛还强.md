　　Wooden Ox Plowing is Even Stronger Than Water Buffalo
    Legend says that Zhuge Liang once used wooden oxen and flowing horses to transport grain and supplies. Today, in the high tide of agricultural tool reform, Sichuan has truly created wooden oxen to replace water buffalo for plowing. An appraisal and test experiment held in Fushun County proved that this wooden ox can not only plow paddy fields, but also has a working efficiency one to three times higher than that of water buffalo. Locally, an ordinary cow can plow about one mu of field a day and harrow more than two mu, while a wooden ox can plow two to three mu and harrow up to ten mu. The Fushun County Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to promote it throughout the county.
    This wooden ox looks very much like a boat with a wooden frame. The main part is a boat-shaped base, with a pair of wooden wheels with vane plates installed on both sides, connected by a wooden shaft (roller) with two small vane wheels installed. When the treadles on the wooden shaft are stepped on to rotate the wooden shaft, the small vane wheels drive the wooden wheels to stir the mud and water in the field, and the hull can move forward. A handrail frame is installed on the hull for holding. When plowing, the plow is hung behind the "ox," and two people drive the "ox" while one person holds the plow; when harrowing, only two people are needed. This wooden ox can be driven by general labor and is also relatively flexible when turning in the field.
    The wooden ox was created by Huang Jizhi, a carpenter at the Muqi (woodworking) Cooperative in Heshi Township, Fushun County. The wooden ox is about five chi (Chinese feet) long and about four chi wide. The current disadvantage is its relatively heavy weight. Fushun County has decided to continue research and improvement during promotion. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 木牛耕田比水牛还强

　　木牛耕田比水牛还强
    传说诸葛亮曾用木牛流马驮运粮草物资，今天在农具改革高潮中，四川却真正创造出木牛代替水牛耕田。富顺县举行的鉴定试验证明，这种木牛不但可以耕耙水田，而且工作效率高出水牛一倍到三倍多。当地一般牛每天能犁田一亩左右，耙田二亩多，而木牛能犁二亩到三亩，耙田达到十亩。中共富顺县委已决定在全县推广。
    这种木牛形状很像一只带木架的船，主要部分是一个船形的底座，两侧安着一对有叶板的木轮，由装有两个小叶轮的木轴（滚杆）连接。当踩动木轴上的践凳使木轴旋转时，小叶轮便带动木轮拨动田中泥水，船体就能向前移动。船体上安装着可供手扶的扶架。犁田时，将犁挂在“牛”后，由两个人驾“牛”，一个人扶犁；耙田时只需两个人。这种木牛一般劳动力都可以驾驶，在田中转动也比较灵活。
    木牛是富顺县何市乡木器社木工黄吉之创制的。木牛长五尺左右，宽四尺左右，目前的缺点是重量较大。富顺县决定在推广中继续加以研究改进。　（据新华社讯）
