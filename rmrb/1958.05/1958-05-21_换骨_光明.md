Rebirth

    Not long after I first went into the fields, I asked to carry manure. The team leader said to the girl who was filling the buckets, "Give him a little less."
    I carried the manure to the field. The spring breeze caressed my face, and I sweated profusely; songs rose all around, and my shoulders ached unbearably. I endured the pain and walked on. An old man driving a cart said to me, "Don't worry, once you've changed your bones, you'll be successful!"
    At night, my back ached and my legs hurt, and I couldn't sleep. Thinking of the old man's words about "changing bones," I felt very happy. Bones are the pillars of the human body, and my original set was not enough to bear the burden of agricultural labor, so of course, I had to change them. But the essence of changing bones goes beyond this. Chairman Mao said, "Lu Xun's bones are the hardest," so it can be seen that "bones" also refer to the thoughts and will of revolutionaries, and "changing bones" actually refers to ideological transformation. Through long-term labor and tempering, undergoing a rebirth is painful, but more importantly, it is joyful, and the latter outweighs the former—and so, I slept soundly until dawn, awakened by the bell preparing for work, and I jumped up to greet another day of labor.

Brightness

    In the manure-carrying team, there was a commune member who was blind. Like everyone else, he went out early and returned late, carrying full loads and walking quickly.
    When I walked with him, I asked, "Don't you have anyone else at home to work?" He replied, "Brother, younger brother, nephew, all are good laborers." "Why do you still come to work?" "Responding to Chairman Mao's call—the Great Leap Forward!"
    When I walked with him again, I asked how he had gone blind. He said, "The landlord's lackeys gouged them out." I was thinking: I must learn more about his history of blood and tears. Suddenly, I heard him say loudly, "Gouging out my eyes won't scare me! Now I see only brightness. Socialism—the bright road pointed out by Chairman Mao, is full of hope!"
    He mustered his strength and walked swiftly, leaving me behind in an instant. I tried hard to catch up, catch up, the fertilizer in the baskets shook with a rustling sound…

    换骨·光明
    冯健男
    换骨
    我初上阵不久，就要求担粪。队长对装粪的姑娘说：“给他少装点。”
    我担着粪，往地里送。春风拂面，我汗如雨下；歌声四起，我肩痛难忍。我忍痛走着。一位赶车的老大爷对我说：“别着急，你换了骨头，就有出息啦！”
    黑夜，腰酸腿痛，不能成寐。想起老大爷“换骨头”的话来，心里非常高兴。骨是人体的支柱，我原有的一副不足以担负农业劳动，当然得换。但换骨的精义，又不止此。毛主席说：“鲁迅的骨头是最硬的”，可见“骨头”又指革命者的思想和意志，“换骨”其实又指思想改造。通过长期的劳动锻炼，脱胎换骨，是会有痛苦的，但更重要的是快乐，后者压倒了前者——正是这样，我一觉睡到天亮，被准备出勤的钟声唤醒，一骨碌爬起来，迎接又一天的劳动生活。
    光明
    在送肥的队伍里，有一个双目失明的社员。他和别人一样，早出晚归，担得满满的，走得快快的。
    当我和他走在一起的时候，我问：“你家里没有别人劳动？”他答：“哥哥，弟弟，侄子，都是好劳力。”“你为什么还来劳动呢？”“响应毛主席的号召——大跃进！”
    当我又一次和他走在一起的时候，我问他的眼是怎么瞎了的。他说：“叫地主的狗腿子挖了。”我正在想：我可得详细了解他的血泪史。忽听得他大声说：“挖掉眼睛也吓唬不了我！如今我眼前是一片光明。社会主义——毛主席指出的光明大道，多有奔头！”
    他鼓起劲，健步如飞，一下子把我撇在后头。我努力赶上去，赶上去，肥土在箩头里被抖动得刷刷直响……
