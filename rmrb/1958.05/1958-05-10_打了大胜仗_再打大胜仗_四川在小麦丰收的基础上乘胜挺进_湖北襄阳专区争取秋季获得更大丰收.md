    After Winning a Great Victory, Win Another Great Victory:
    Sichuan, on the Basis of a Bumper Wheat Harvest, Advances Victoriously;
    Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Strives for a Greater Harvest in the Autumn
    (By Our Staff Reporters) The Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a telephone conference on the evening of May 4th, attended by the responsible persons of various regional and municipal Party committees, to review the increase in production of spring grain crops and to study the increase in production plans for major spring crops, in order to promote a greater leap forward in agricultural production throughout the province. At the meeting, the regional Party committees reported that this year's spring grain crops throughout the province increased by more than 15% compared to last year, an increase of approximately 1 billion jin of grain. The meeting analyzed that the conditions for this year's major spring production are more favorable than in any previous year: the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people for a great leap forward in production is very high; since last winter, various localities have made great achievements in water conservancy construction, soil improvement, and water and soil conservation; preparations for this year's major spring production have been relatively adequate; the sowing and transplanting of early rice, mid-season rice, and sweet potatoes have generally been carried out half a month to twenty days earlier than last year; the province has universally promoted advanced techniques such as the selection of improved varieties and the implementation of close planting, and sweet potatoes have also universally promoted "nesting sweet potatoes," as well as techniques such as long vines, early planting, flat insertion, and shallow planting; this year, fertilizer is generally more than doubled compared to last year, with fertilizer application per mu reaching more than 10,000 jin, and even reaching 50,000 jin in some cases; recently, most areas have also received welcome rainfall, ensuring the sowing and transplanting of crops such as rice and sweet potatoes; currently, the growth of early rice is good, and it is expected that late rice may also be transplanted half a month to twenty days earlier than last year. Therefore, the regional Party committees unanimously believe that striving for a greater harvest and achieving a higher target than the originally planned increase of 7 billion jin of grain this year is entirely possible and also certain.
    In order to achieve the new production increase requirements, the meeting required that all localities immediately convey this new production increase requirement to counties, districts, townships, and communes, so that everyone can engage in discussions in order to unify thinking and understanding, and mobilize the broad masses of cadres and peasants to resolutely implement it. At the same time, a comparison and inspection campaign for major spring production should be launched immediately throughout the province, and a comprehensive mass inspection should be launched to discover and promote more advanced production increase measures, and to solve various problems existing in production.
    The meeting believes that politics is the commander, and political and ideological work is the prerequisite for ensuring a great leap forward in production. To this end, all localities must further strengthen political and ideological work, continue to mobilize the masses, muster their energy, strive for the top, and fight to achieve the new production increase target.

    (By Our Staff Reporter) Sichuan Province's 50 million mu of spring grain crops have achieved a bumper harvest, increasing by more than 15% compared to last year, an increase of approximately 1 billion jin of grain. The broad scope and large scale of the increase are a feature of this year's spring grain crop production. Six prefectures, including Luzhou, Neijiang, Jiangjin, Fuling, Wanxian, and Ya'an, have all increased their spring production by more than 20%. In Luzhou Prefecture, the four main crops of wheat and broad beans have increased by a minimum of 17% and a maximum of 53%.
    This year's bumper harvest of spring grain crops is the result of the winter production movement focused on water conservancy construction and soil improvement launched throughout the province last winter and this spring. The broad masses of peasants, whose ideological awareness has been raised through the Socialist Education Movement, overcame various difficulties and expanded the planting area of spring grain crops by 4.9%; the spring sowing and field management were also carried out more carefully than in the past. These are important reasons for the bumper harvest.
    After the rectification movement, leaders at all levels in the countryside also changed their past generalized working methods. The vast majority of district and township cadres have moved from their offices to agricultural cooperatives to live, conducting in-depth and specific leadership, and being responsible for specific areas. The leadership methods of comparison, inspection, and grasping both ends to bring along the middle have been mastered by the broad masses of rural cadres, thus powerfully promoting agricultural production.
    Currently, with the exception of areas along the Yangtze River where the season is earlier and which have basically completed the spring harvest, the harvesting of barley, peas, and broad beans has also been completed in other areas, and wheat and rapeseed are being harvested at an accelerated pace.

    (By Our Staff Reporter) While striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops, Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province has also put forward the slogan "Strive to Double Autumn Crops Again." At present, various counties are taking vigorous measures to strive to realize this slogan. The more than 10 million mu of summer crops in Xiangyang Prefecture are nearing maturity, and it is estimated that these crops can yield an average of more than 300 jin per mu. The total output of summer grain in the district will reach 3 billion jin, an increase of onefold compared to last year, accounting for three-quarters of the total grain output of the district last year. Among them, the output of summer harvest in counties such as Xiangyang, Zaoyang, and Guanghua has exceeded the total grain output of these counties last year. In this situation, some cadres and masses began to show complacency and relaxation, believing that as long as they put in a little effort in autumn crops, they can complete the originally planned increase of 50% compared to last year. Based on this situation, the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, after analyzing the potential for increasing production of autumn crops, promptly put forward the call to "Strive to Double Autumn Crops Again," encouraging the broad masses of people and cadres to continue to advance bravely. In addition to revising the plan, various counties are also conducting a major debate among the broad masses of cadres and people on whether autumn crops can be doubled, in order to overcome conservative thinking and slack and paralyzing emotions, and to find measures for further increasing production.
    In order to achieve the requirement of doubling autumn crops, the Xiangyang area is currently focusing on the following measures around the center of "Guaranteeing the Transplanting of 7 Million Mu of Rice Seedlings" (an increase of 4 million mu compared to last year): First, storing and conserving water. After the large-scale water conservancy construction in Xiangyang Prefecture last winter and this spring, the area of paddy fields can be expanded by more than 4 million mu this year. However, many reservoirs, weirs, and ponds have not yet been filled with water. A month ago, the district mobilized more than 1.5 million people to participate in the water storage movement. Now, there are still about 700,000 people throughout the district pumping water into ponds on various riverbanks, storing about 7 million cubic meters of water every day. The water already stored in the district can guarantee the transplanting of more than 5 million mu of paddy fields. Second, vigorously engaging in fertilizer accumulation. The district has proposed "Jin of Grain for Dan of Fertilizer." Many counties are using the gap before the wheat harvest to launch another mass fertilizer accumulation movement. At present, the agricultural cooperatives throughout the district have newly built tens of thousands of field manure pits. Third, ensuring the quality of transplanting, requiring that all be appropriately close-planted. During transplanting, each team and everyone must have transplanting gauges, and the row and plant spacing must be at least 4×6 inches. In order to ensure that the transplanting meets the specifications, the secretaries of the county, district, and township Party committees took the lead in test transplanting during the early rice transplanting, setting an example for the agricultural cooperatives. In addition, various counties have also adopted measures such as multiple harvests, expanding the planting area, etc. (Luo Chongzhang)

    打了大胜仗　再打大胜仗
    四川在小麦丰收的基础上乘胜挺进
    湖北襄阳专区争取秋季获得更大丰收
    本报讯　中共四川省委在5月4日晚上召开由各地委、市委负责人参加的电话会议，检查小春粮食作物增产的情况，并且研究了大春生产的增产计划，以推动全省农业生产更大的跃进。会上，各地委汇报全省今年小春粮食作物比去年增产15％以上，约增产粮食十亿斤。会议分析了今年大春生产所具备的条件比以往任何一年更为有利：广大干部和群众生产大跃进的干劲很足，去年冬天以来各地在兴修水利、改良土壤和水土保持等方面，都作出了巨大的成绩；今年大春生产准备工作做得比较充分；早稻、中稻和红苕（甘薯）的播种、栽插，时间一般都比去年提早半个月到二十天；全省普遍推广了选用良种、实行密植等先进技术，红苕也普遍推广了“窝子苕”，以及长藤、早栽、平插、浅栽等技术；今年肥料一般比去年增加一倍多，每亩施肥量达到一万斤以上，甚至有的达到五万斤；最近大多数地区又普遍降喜雨，保证了水稻、红苕等作物播种和栽插；目前，早稻生长情况良好，预计晚稻也可能比去年提前半个月到二十天栽插完毕。因此，各地委一致认为，争取更大的丰收，达到比原订今年增产粮食七十亿斤更高的目标是完全有可能，也是有把握的。
    为了实现新的增产要求，会议要求各地应立即把这个新的增产要求传达到县、区、乡、社，让大家展开讨论，以便统一思想认识，动员广大干部和农民坚决贯彻执行。同时要立即在全省范围开展一个大春生产的评比检查运动，全面展开群众性的大检查，发现和推广更多的先进增产措施，解决生产中存在的各种问题。
    会议认为，政治是统帅，政治思想工作是保证生产大跃进的前提条件，为此，各地必须进一步加强政治思想工作，继续发动群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为争取达到新的增产目标而奋斗。　（邵挺军）
    本报讯　四川省五千万亩小春粮食作物获得丰收，比去年增产15％以上，约增产粮食十亿斤。增产面广、幅度大，是今年小春粮食作物生产的一个特点。泸州、内江、江津、涪陵、万县、雅安等六个专区，小春增产都在20％以上。泸州专区的小麦、蚕豆等四种主要作物，最低的增产17％，最高的增产53％。
    今年小春粮食作物的丰收，是去冬今春全省开展以兴修水利、改良土壤等为中心的冬季生产运动的结果。经过社会主义教育运动而提高了思想觉悟的广大农民，克服各种困难，扩大小春粮食作物播种面积4.9％；在小春播种和田间管理方面，也进行得比过去细致。这都是丰收的重要原因。
    经过整风运动，农村各级领导也都改变了过去一般化的工作方法。绝大多数区、乡干部都从办公室搬到农业社里去住，进行深入具体领导、分片包干负责。评比检查、抓两头带中间的领导方法，已被广大农村干部掌握，因而有力地推动了农业生产。
    现在，全省除长江两岸季节较早的地区已基本结束小春收割工作外，其他地区的大麦、豌豆、蚕豆也已收割完毕，正加紧收割小麦和油菜。　（孙跃冬）
    本报讯　湖北省襄阳专区在争取夏收作物丰收的同时，又提出“争取秋季作物再翻一翻”的口号。目前各县纷纷采取有力措施，力争实现这一口号。现在襄阳专区的一千多万亩夏收作物已接近成熟，估计这些作物平均每亩能收获三百斤以上。全区夏收粮食总产量将达三十亿斤，较去年增产一倍，为去年全区粮食总产量的四分之三，其中襄阳、枣阳、光化等县夏收一季的产量便超过这些县去年全年的粮食总产量。在这种情况下，有的干部和群众开始出现自满和松气情绪，认为秋季作物只要随便加把劲，便可完成原定较去年增产50％的计划。中共襄阳地委根据这一情况，分析了秋季作物增产的潜力后，及时提出“争取秋季作物再翻一翻”的号召，鼓舞广大群众和干部继续奋勇前进。各县根据这一号召除修订了规划外，并将秋收作物能否翻一翻的问题，在广大干部和群众中开展一次大辩论，以便克服保守思想和松劲、麻痹情绪，找出进一步增产的措施。
    为了实现秋季作物翻一翻的要求，襄阳地区目前正围绕“保证插秧七百万亩”（比去年增加四百万亩）这一中心，紧紧抓住以下几项措施：首先是蓄水保水。襄阳专区去冬今春大兴水利后，今年可扩大水田四百多万亩。但有很多水库、堰、塘尚未蓄满水，一个月前，全区曾动员了一百五十多万人参加蓄水运动。现在，全区每天还有七十万人左右在各个河岸上车水灌塘，大约每天能蓄水七百万立方公尺左右。现在全区已蓄的水可保证五百多万亩水田插秧用。其次，是大搞积肥。全区提出“斤粮担肥”。许多县正利用麦收前一段空隙时间又开展一次群众性积肥运动。现在全区各农业社新修的田头粪壋数以十万计。第三，是保证插秧质量，要求一律做到适当密植。插秧时要队队人人有插秧规格器，行株距最稀的也要达到4×6寸。为了保证插秧合乎规格，各县在早稻插秧时由县、区、乡各级党委书记层层带头试插，给各农业社做出榜样。此外，各县还采取了多种多收、扩大种植面积等措施。　（罗重章）
