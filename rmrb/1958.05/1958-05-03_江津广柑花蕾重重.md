    Jiangjin Guanggan Orange Blossoms Abundant

    (By our reporter) The Guanggan oranges of Jiangjin County, Sichuan, which are famous throughout the country, are growing exceptionally well this year, with a bloom more abundant than in recent decades. Currently, fruit farmers are working intensively to apply hidden flower fertilizer and control pests, confident that they will achieve this year's leap forward plan to produce more than 46.6 million catties of Guanggan oranges, double the historical peak yield of 1954. Last spring, after the collectivization of orchards into cooperatives, a foundation was laid for a leap forward in Guanggan production. This year, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership and corrected the tendency of some cadres and masses to underestimate fruit production. Party committees at the district and township levels have designated deputy secretaries to specifically lead Guanggan production, and agricultural cooperatives have established specialized production teams to manage fruit trees, properly resolving the contradictions in the use of labor, fertilizer, and funds in agriculture and fruit production. Since then, a Guanggan bumper harvest campaign has unfolded in various places, with every cooperative cultivating high-yield orchards and every person cultivating high-yield trees.

    江津广柑花蕾重重
    本报讯　闻名全国的四川江津县广柑，今年生长特别好，开花之多，是近几十年来少有的。现在，果农们正在紧张地施隐花肥和防治害虫，他们有把握实现今年跃进计划，生产广柑四千六百多万斤，比历史上最高年产量1954年多一倍。去年春天，这里果树入社集中经营后，便为广柑生产跃进打下基础。今年各级党委又加强了领导，纠正了部分干部和群众轻视果树生产的偏向。区、乡级党委都确定由副书记具体领导广柑生产，各农业社建立经营果树的专业生产队，妥善解决了农业和果树生产上劳力、肥料、资金使用的矛盾。从此之后，社社培植高产园、人人培植高产树的广柑丰产运动在各地展开。
