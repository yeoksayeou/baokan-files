Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 11th - An official spokesman of the United Arab Republic said on the evening of the 10th that the United Arab Republic fully supports the Republic of Indonesia's struggle to defend its independence and oppose foreign interference.

The spokesman mentioned that the United Arab Republic had received a note from the Indonesian government informing the United Arab Republic government of foreign interference from certain countries aimed at assisting rebels against the Indonesian government. The spokesman said that such assistance to the rebels is an illegal interference and constitutes a violation of all recognized international principles and the United Nations Charter.

He said that the government of the United Arab Republic strongly condemns this interference and demands that the governments hiding behind it consider the serious consequences that are bound to arise from interfering in the internal affairs of a free and independent country and a member state of the United Nations.

He also said that the United Arab Republic and the Republic of Indonesia are linked by ties of friendship, amity, and cooperation.

　　阿联支持印度尼西亚斗争
    严斥援助叛军的干涉者
    新华社开罗11日电　阿拉伯联合共和国一位官方发言人10日晚上说，阿拉伯联合共和国完全支持印度尼西亚共和国保卫独立和反对外国干涉的斗争。
    这位发言人谈到阿拉伯联合共和国接到了印度尼西亚政府的照会，这个照会告知阿拉伯联合共和国政府来自某些国家的目的在于帮助叛乱分子反对印度尼西亚政府的外来干涉。发言人说，对叛乱分子的这种援助是一种非法的干涉，构成了违反一切公认的国际原则和联合国宪章的行为。
    他说，阿拉伯联合共和国政府严厉谴责这种干涉，并且要求藏在它背后的政府考虑对于一个自由独立的国家和联合国会员国的内政进行干涉所必然引起的严重后果。
    他还说，阿拉伯联合共和国同印度尼西亚共和国是由友谊、亲睦和合作的纽带联结起来的。
