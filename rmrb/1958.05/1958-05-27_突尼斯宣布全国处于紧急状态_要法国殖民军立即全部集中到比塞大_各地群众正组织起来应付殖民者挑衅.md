　　Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Tunis dispatch: Tunisian President Bourguiba today demanded that French troops still stationed in several strongholds in Tunisia concentrate entirely in the Bizerte naval base area within twenty-four hours. Prior to this, Bourguiba declared a national state of emergency on the 25th to confront the provocative actions of the French colonial army.

　　A communiqué issued by the Tunisian Information Department on the 25th stated that starting around 7:00 AM that day, French colonial army-owned American-made B-26 twin-engine bombers and fighter planes repeatedly bombed and strafed the Remada area in southern Tunisia, destroying some public works and sanitary vehicles.

　　At the same time, the French colonial army has been launching ground attacks against Tunisian troops since the early morning of the 25th. The French colonial army command stationed in Tunisia had announced that the French commander in Remada had decided to take action to "pacify" the area within ten kilometers of the Remada stronghold.

　　The Tunisian government protested to France after the Remada incident. The New Constitution Party's organ newspaper, "Action," demanded in strong terms a deadline for the withdrawal of the air force still remaining in Tunisia and Morocco.

　　Demonstrations demanding the withdrawal of French troops have been held throughout Tunisia. In the port of Bizerte, five thousand people demonstrated, demanding to be armed to defend the motherland and the immediate withdrawal of French troops. Under the call of the New Constitution Party, "Vigilance Committees" have been established throughout Tunisia. The New Constitution Party has also called on party organizations at all levels to formulate plans for mobilizing the masses to cope with the development of the situation.

    突尼斯宣布全国处于紧急状态
    要法国殖民军立即全部集中到比塞大
    各地群众正组织起来应付殖民者挑衅
    新华社26日讯　突尼斯消息：突尼斯总统布尔吉巴今天要求仍然驻扎在突尼斯一些据点的法国军队在二十四小时内全部集中到比塞大海军基地地区。在这以前，布尔吉巴在25日宣布全国处于紧急状态，以对付法国殖民军的挑衅行动。
    突尼斯情报部25日发表公报说，在这一天上午约七时起，法国殖民军拥有的美制B—26型双引擎轰炸机和战斗机轮番轰炸和扫射了突尼斯南部的雷玛大地区，一些公共工程和卫生车辆被炸毁。
    与此同时，法国殖民军从25日清晨起一直在对突尼斯军队发动地面攻击。驻在突尼斯的法国殖民军司令部曾经宣布，雷玛大的法军司令官已经决定采取行动，要“肃清”雷玛大据点周围十公里以内的地区。
    突尼斯政府在雷玛大事件后向法国提出了抗议。新宪政党的机关报“行动报”以强硬措词要求限期撤出仍然留在突尼斯和摩洛哥境内的空军。
    突尼斯全国各地都举行了要求法军撤退的示威。在比塞大港有五千人示威，要求武装起来保卫祖国和立即撤退法国军队。在新宪政党的号召下，突尼斯全国各地已经成立了“警惕委员会”。新宪政党还号召各级党组织制定动员群众的计划，以应付局势的发展。
