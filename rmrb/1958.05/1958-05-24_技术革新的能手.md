A Master of Technological Innovation
By Our Correspondent Gong Chenghua

    Ling Hongjun, a machine repair worker at the Chongqing Jialing Machine Factory, fully demonstrated the communist spirit of "One for all, all for one" in the process of technological innovation. On February 23rd, all the workers in the iron shell switch section of the second workshop's lathe, fitter, and milling group at the Chongqing Jialing Machine Factory were very worried, because there were only five days left in the month, and half of the month's production tasks remained uncompleted. The reason for not being able to complete the task was that the production efficiency of the main part of the iron shell switch, the perforated pile head, was too low, but everyone could not think of a way to improve it.

    In early February, Ling Hongjun was transferred from the machine repair group to the lathe, fitter, and milling group. He was in charge of grinding rivets and was not responsible for the production of perforated pile heads. He completed his February production tasks very well, but he thought that although his individual tasks were completed, the main thing was to ensure that the group completed its tasks. Therefore, he became more concerned about the production of perforated pile heads. After two days and nights of deliberation, he proposed a method of operating with both hands. This not only increased product output but also ensured quality. With the help of leaders and comrades, this method was successfully tested, and the daily output increased from the original 850 pieces to 4,270 pieces, and the February production task could be completed ahead of schedule.

    From then on, Ling Hongjun was responsible for the production of perforated pile heads. With the production efficiency of perforated pile heads improved, the production level of the next process—manually grinding the burrs of the perforated pile heads—seemed very backward. The idea of "How to help the next process speed up the completion of tasks" became Ling Hongjun's concern again. Ling Hongjun thought: "If this process is improved, but the next process is not improved, the group's task will still not be completed." Therefore, he specifically looked for shortcomings in his own operation to reduce product burrs and create favorable conditions for the production of the next process. After painstaking thinking, Ling Hongjun found another trick in early March, which greatly reduced product burrs, and the daily output increased from 4,200 pieces to 5,200 pieces. At this time, Ling Hongjun thought again: How great it would be if the production level of each of our comrades could be improved together! Therefore, he suggested changing the manual grinding of perforated pile head burrs to machine processing. The technician believed that the quality requirements of this process were very strict and could only be produced manually, disagreeing with Ling Hongjun's suggestion. However, Ling Hongjun's determination to improve his operating technology did not waver. Especially when he thought that after he improved the production technology of perforated pile heads, the manual grinding process took twice as many workers as before to complete the monthly task, which still lacked a guarantee for completing the group's task. Therefore, he insisted on research, and finally succeeded in the experiment. After adopting his method, the production task that originally took two workers a month to complete could be completed in just two hours.

    However, the production efficiency of the manual grinding process increased even more, and the supply of perforated pile heads could not keep up, forming a new imbalance. Ling Hongjun turned around again to find ways to improve the production efficiency of perforated pile heads. After his hard work, he finally manufactured a special machine for cutting off perforated pile heads, and the daily output of perforated pile heads increased to 20,000 pieces, which was 23 times higher than the original quota. Everyone named this machine the Perforated Pile Head Cutting Machine. After Ling Hongjun used the Perforated Pile Head Cutting Machine for production, the burrs of the product became sharp edges that could only be felt when touched by hand due to high-speed cutting. Therefore, he further proposed improvements to the next process, so that the output of the manual grinding process increased by 1,488 times compared to the manual operation before the improvement, and all the files used for manual grinding were also saved.

    Ling Hongjun said: "I treat the difficulties of others as my own difficulties, and others also treat my difficulties as their own difficulties." Ling Hongjun then talked about the continuous coil retaining ring working method he successfully improved on April 15th, which increased production efficiency by 38 times. Originally, retaining rings were processed on lathe machines, and the production efficiency was not high. After Ling Hongjun repeatedly thought about it, he wanted to change to using a coiling machine for processing. However, Ling Hongjun did not understand the production technology of coiling machines, so he ran to Cao Renzhong, a master worker in the sixth workshop who specialized in coiling machines, to ask for advice. Cao Renzhong took the initiative to patiently and actively help this young man. He spent a whole day operating and explaining to Ling Hongjun. That night, Ling Hongjun requested to use the master worker's machine to produce retaining rings, and eight parts for producing retaining rings had to be replaced on the machine. The master worker accepted his request. The experiment of producing retaining rings on that day was not successful, and Cao Renzhong helped him analyze the reasons for the failure. The next day, Cao Renzhong helped Ling Hongjun to successfully complete this bold reform.

    It is in this way that Ling Hongjun dares to think, dares to act, works hard, and humbly asks veteran workers for advice, becoming a good example of technological innovation. (Attached picture)

    技术革新的能手
    本报记者　龚成华
    重庆嘉陵机器厂机修工人凌鸿钧，在革新技术的过程中，充分发扬了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义精神。2 月23日，重庆嘉陵机器厂第二车间铁壳开关工段车钳铣组的全体工人都很发愁，因为离月底只有五天了，本月的生产任务还有一半没有完成。不能完成任务的原因，是铁壳开关的主要零件有孔桩头的生产效率太低，但是大家又想不出改进的办法。
    2月初凌鸿钧从机修组调到车钳铣组，他是管打磨铆钉的，并不负责生产有孔桩头。他2月份的生产任务完成得很好，但是他想到个人任务虽然完成了，但主要是保证小组完成任务。于是，他对有孔桩头的生产情况更加关心起来。他经过两昼夜揣摩，提出一个双手进行操作的方法。这样，既能提高产品产量，又能保证质量，这个方法在领导和同志们的帮助下试验成功了，日产量由原来的八百五十件提高到四千二百七十件，2月份生产任务可以提前完成了。
    从那时起，凌鸿钧就负责生产有孔桩头。有孔桩头生产效率提高了，下道工序——手工打磨有孔桩头毛边的生产水平就显得十分落后。“怎样帮助下道工序加快速度完成任务”的想法，又成了凌鸿钧的心事。凌鸿钧想：“这道工序改进，下道工序不改，小组任务还是完成不了。”于是，他专门找寻自己操作中的缺点，减少产品的毛边，为下道工序的生产创造有利条件。经过苦心思索，凌鸿钧在3月初又找到一个窍门，使产品毛头大大减少，日产量由四千二百件又提高到五千二百件。这时，凌鸿钧又想到：如果我们每个同志的生产水平都能共同提高一步，那该多好！因此，他建议手工打磨有孔桩头毛边改为机器加工。技术员认为这道工序质量要求十分严格，只能用手工生产，不同意凌鸿钧的建议。但是凌鸿钧改进操作技术的决心没有动摇。特别是当他想到自己改进有孔桩头生产技术以后，手工打磨工序是采取比原来增加两倍的工人才完成当月任务的，这样对完成小组任务还是缺乏保证的。因此，他坚持研究，最后终于试验成功。采用他的办法后，原来两个工人一个月的生产任务，只需要两小时就可以完成了。
    但是，手工打磨工序的生产效率又提高得多一些，有孔桩头又供应不上了，形成新的不平衡。凌鸿钧又掉过头来设法提高有孔桩头的生产效率。经过他刻苦钻研，终于制造出一种专门用于切断有孔桩头的机器，有孔桩头的日产量提高到二万件，比原来的定额提高二十三倍。大家给这部机器取的名字叫有孔桩头切断机。凌鸿钧利用有孔桩头切断机生产后，由于采取高速切削，产品的毛边变为用手摸时才能感到的锋边，因此他又进一步提出改进下道工序的建议，使手工打磨这道工序的产量比未改进前的手工操作提高生产效率一千四百八十八倍，手工打磨时使用的锉刀也全部节约下来。
    凌鸿钧说：“我把别人的困难当成是自己的困难，别人也把我的困难当成他们自己的困难”。凌鸿钧接着谈到他在4月15日改进成功的连续卷挡圈工作法，提高生产效率三十八倍的事情。原来是在元车上加工挡圈，生产效率不高，凌鸿钧反复思考以后，想改为利用卷簧机加工。但是凌鸿钧并不懂卷簧机的生产技术，他就跑到六车间专门掌握卷簧机的老师傅曹仁忠那里去讨教，曹仁忠主动、耐心、积极帮助这个年轻人。他用一整天的时间，操作给凌鸿钧看，又讲解给他听。当晚凌鸿钧要求利用老师傅的机器生产挡圈，要在机器上换上生产挡圈的八个零件，老师傅接受了他的要求。当天生产挡圈的试验没有成功，曹仁忠又帮助他分析失败的原因。次日，曹仁忠帮助凌鸿钧把这个大胆的改革才告成功。
    凌鸿钧就是这样敢想、敢干、苦心钻研，虚心向老工人请教，成为一个技术革新的好榜样。（附图片）
