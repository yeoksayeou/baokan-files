　　Wuhan, May 18th (From our newspaper) The people building the Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex are now breaking the old rules of industrial construction, thinking boldly, acting boldly, accelerating the pace of construction, and ensuring that the No. 1 blast furnace produces iron on National Day this year.
　　The two large steam blowers for Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace are being installed for the first time in China. The advanced Hu Zhaosen work section has installed more than a dozen blowers, all of which involved installing the turbine and blower body first, followed by their auxiliary equipment. However, the installation task for Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace's two blowers is only being handled by two fitter teams, and the blowers being installed are much larger than before. After discussion and debate, they boldly changed the conventional method of installing blowers, installing the turbine and blower's auxiliary equipment first, followed by their bodies. This reform allows all types of workers to enter the construction site at the same time for simultaneous cross-installation, ensuring that the two fitter teams can complete the installation of the two blowers in four months. This will not only ensure the quality of installation, but also save more than 30,000 yuan in construction costs. The workers installing the three car dumpers in the sintering plant and coking plant boldly broke the conventional method of installing car dumpers. Car dumpers have dozens of parts, which were previously installed one by one on the narrow and deep foundations of the car dumper room. Now, they pre-assemble the various parts in a pre-assembly yard, and then hoist them as a whole onto the foundation. This not only shortens the construction period for each car dumper from ninety days to forty-five days, but also creates safe and good working conditions for the installation workers, and saves 10,000 yuan in construction costs per car dumper. The builders of the sintering plant chimney and No. 1 coke oven have also repeatedly advanced the construction period by reforming and developing the original construction methods. The 120-meter-high chimney of the sintering plant was completed in just forty-five days, which is twenty days faster than the highest record in China's chimney construction history.
　　Wuhan, May 18th (From our newspaper) A reporter learned from Wuhan Iron and Steel Company that more than 50 factories in various parts of the Soviet Union are stepping up the manufacturing of more than 2,000 items of equipment for Wu Steel to ensure the early iron production of Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace. These factories and the hundreds of factories cooperating with them in production have decided to manufacture the equipment half a year ahead of the original contract.
　　The main areas manufacturing equipment for Wu Steel - the Russian Republic and the Ukrainian Republic - have made special decisions to advance the delivery date of Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace equipment from the end of this year to June. The Kharkov Electrical Appliance Factory, which is making the electrical control station for the blast furnace, originally planned to deliver the goods at the end of the year, but finally decided to complete the production by July 15th. The leaders and workers of the Odessa Weighing Car Factory, knowing that Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace would produce iron early, decided to tap all production potential and manufacture the weighing cars needed for the blast furnace from the original plan of the fourth quarter to June. Soviet railway workers will also adopt rapid operation methods to complete the transportation work that usually takes one or two months in twelve to fifteen days, and transport the equipment to the Wu Steel construction site as soon as possible.
　　The person in charge of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company said that the Soviet Union's rush to manufacture equipment for Wu Steel once again proves the Soviet Union's great and selfless assistance to China. The completion of these major and critical equipment for the No. 1 blast furnace half a year in advance is an important guarantee for the No. 1 blast furnace to produce iron on October 1st and for the great leap forward in Wu Steel's construction.
　　Wuhan, May 18th (From our newspaper) More than 170 factories across the country are launching large-scale cooperation to rush to manufacture equipment for Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace to produce iron early. Tens of thousands of tons of equipment required for the No. 1 blast furnace system project can be manufactured one to three months ahead of schedule. Now, trains full of equipment are driving into the Wu Steel construction site every day.
　　At the beginning of this year, after the Wu Steel builders decided to advance the iron production of the No. 1 blast furnace to October 1st, the inadequate supply of equipment became the main contradiction. At that time, the leaders of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company personally went to mechanical manufacturing factories in various places to request the early manufacturing of equipment, and received strong support. The Party secretaries and responsible cadres of industrial departments in Liaoning, Hunan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Harbin, Yingkou and other provinces and cities personally held meetings to organize the factories to rearrange the production plan according to the advanced construction period of Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace.
　　The workers in each manufacturing factory were inspired by the news that Wu Steel's No. 1 blast furnace would produce iron early, and they took various effective measures to complete the manufacturing tasks ahead of schedule. The large bell, small bell, and balance hammer of the blast furnace undertaken by Shenyang Heavy Machinery Factory are one of the key equipment of No. 1 blast furnace. The original plan was to deliver the goods at the end of this year, but now it has been decided to deliver the goods in June. The workers of Dalian Crane Factory, who undertook the production of blast furnace electromagnetic cranes, changed the design of the electromagnetic cranes, which not only saved funds, but also could deliver the equipment to Wu Steel one quarter ahead of schedule. Shenyang Water Pump Factory undertook the production of more than 80 water pumps for Wu Steel, not only trying to overcome difficulties to make them ahead of schedule, but also actively sent people to various cooperative factories to strengthen production cooperation. Now, more than 30 water pumps have been transported to the construction site. Nearly 40,000 sets of electrical appliances, instruments, meters and other equipment needed by Wu Steel's blast furnace and coking furnace have also been supported by dozens of motor factories in Shanghai.
　　Now the date of iron production of No. 1 blast furnace is getting closer and closer. According to the person in charge of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the current problems are: the equipment that has been ordered needs to be manufactured on time or ahead of schedule, quickly installed and transported; in addition, a small part of the equipment that has not been ordered in the past also needs the help of manufacturing factories. In particular, the transportation task is heavy, and thousands of tons of equipment are transported from various places to the construction site every month. They hope that the factories and railway and shipping departments will continue to give strong support.

　　保证武钢国庆出铁
    施工打破陈规，建设快步如飞
    苏联老大哥决定提前交货，兄弟工厂四面支援
    本报武汉18日电　建设武汉钢铁联合企业的人们，最近纷纷冲破工业建设中的老规矩，大胆地想，大胆地干，促使建设工程大踏步地前进，并且保证第一号高炉在今年国庆日出铁。
    武钢一号高炉的两台大型蒸汽鼓风机，在我国还是第一次安装。先进的胡兆森工段，曾经安装过十几台鼓风机，都是先安装透平机和鼓风机的本体，然后安装它们的附属设备。但是，武钢一号高炉两台鼓风机的安装任务，只由两个钳工组负责，而安装的鼓风机又比过去大得多。经过讨论和争辩，他们大胆地改变了历来安装鼓风机的常规，先安装透平机和鼓风机的附属设备，然后安装它们的本体。这个改革，使各工种能够一齐进入施工现场，同时交叉安装，保证了两个钳工组能在四个月内安完两台鼓风机，既不影响安装质量，还可以节约施工费用三万多元。安装烧结厂和炼焦化工厂三台翻车机的职工们，大胆地打破了安装翻车机的常规。翻车机有几十种机件，过去人们都是在狭窄、深邃的翻车机室基础上，一件件地安装的；现在他们把各种机件先在预拼场上组合起来，然后整体地吊装到基础上。这样，不仅能使每届翻车机的施工期由九十天缩短为四十五天，而且为安装工人们创造了安全、良好的劳动条件，每台翻车机还可节约一万元的施工费用。烧结厂烟囱和一号炼焦炉的建设者们，也都因为改革和发展了原来的施工方法，三番五次地把工期提前。烧结厂一百二十公尺高的烟囱，只砌了四十五天就完成了，比我国砌筑烟囱史上的最高纪录，还快了二十天。
    本报武汉18日电　记者从武汉钢铁公司获悉：苏联各地五十多个工厂，正在加紧制造武钢的二千多项设备，以保证武钢一号高炉提前出铁。这些工厂以及和这些工厂协作生产的几百个工厂，都决定比原合同提前半年把设备制造出来。
    为武钢制造设备的主要地区——俄罗斯共和国和乌克兰共和国，都专门作出决定，把武钢一号高炉设备交货日期，从今年年底提前到6月。为高炉制作电气操纵站的卡尔科夫电器厂，原计划年底交货，最后决定提前在7月15日制作完毕。奥德萨秤量车厂的负责人和职工群众，知道武钢一号高炉提前出铁以后，决定挖掘一切生产潜力，把高炉所需的秤量车从原计划的第四季度提前到6月制造出来。苏联铁路工人，也将采用快速运转的方法，用十二天到十五天的时间，完成平时一两个月的运输工作，把设备尽快运到武钢工地。
    武汉钢铁公司负责人说，苏联为武钢赶制设备这件事，再一次证明了苏联对我国伟大、无私的援助。一号高炉这些重大的关键性的设备提前半年制成，这是一号高炉提前在10月1日出铁和武钢建设大跃进的重要保证。
    本报武汉18日电　全国一百七十多个工厂正展开大协作，为武钢一号高炉提前出铁赶制设备；一号高炉系统工程所需要的数万吨设备，都可以提前一个月到三个月制成。现在，每天已有满载设备的列车驶进武钢工地。
    今年年初，武钢建设者决定把一号高炉提前到10月1日出铁后，设备供应不及成了主要矛盾。当时，武汉钢铁公司领导人亲到各地机械制造工厂商请提前制造设备，得到了大力支持。辽宁、湖南、上海、广州、沈阳、哈尔滨、营口等省、市党委书记和工业部门负责干部，都亲自召开会议，组织各厂根据武钢一号高炉提前的工期，重新安排了生产计划。
    各制造工厂的职工，为武钢一号高炉提前出铁的消息所鼓舞，纷纷采取各种有力措施，提前完成制作任务。沈阳重型机器厂承制的高炉大钟、小钟、平衡锤等，是一号高炉的关键设备之一，原来计划今年年底交货现在决定提前到6月交货。担负高炉电磁吊车制作的大连起重机厂职工，改变了电磁吊车的设计，不仅节约了资金，而且能提前一个季度把设备送到武钢。沈阳水泵厂承制了武钢八十多台水泵，不仅自己想办法克服困难提前制作，而且主动派人到各协作工厂去加强生产协作。现在，已有三十多台水泵运到工地。武钢高炉、炼焦炉所需要的近四万台电器、计器、仪表等设备也得到上海市几十个电机工厂的支援。
    现在一号高炉出铁的日期越来越逼近了。据武汉钢铁公司负责人说，目前的问题是：已经订了合同的设备，需要按期或提前制成，快装快运；此外，还有一少部分过去未订合同的设备，也需要制造工厂的帮助。特别是运输任务繁重，每月有数千吨设备从各地运进工地，他们希望各工厂和铁路、航运部门继续给以大力的支援。
