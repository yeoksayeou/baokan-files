　　Big Performance to Promote Goods

　　With the spread and development of the economic crisis, American bosses are increasingly worried about the goods piled up in warehouses. In order to step up the promotion of inventory, capitalists rack their brains to use a variety of methods and launch large-scale promotion campaigns everywhere.

　　Frenzied Promotion Campaign

　　According to a report in the May issue of the American magazine "Newsweek," American car company bosses are working hard to convince the American people that buying cars can help overcome the economic crisis. Under the slogan "Buy Your Car Now," large-scale promotion campaigns are being conducted or planned in more than 200 cities across the country. Car dealers in New York City decided to hire circus animals and clowns to help with the sixteen-day sales campaign. Thus, the circus, whose business has been declining recently, became a promotional assistant for the car company. To cheer up the 2,000 car salesmen in New York, the famous Ringling Brothers Circus recently held a special "inspirational" performance for the salesmen at Madison Square Garden. The host of this performance, Powell, the national sales manager of Chevrolet cars, also taught them sales techniques in conjunction with the program performance. He wants everyone to go out and sell, and apply the circus's acting skills to sales.

　　Car dealers in Los Angeles came up with an even more attractive idea. They hired strangely dressed girls to lead a motorcade composed of new cars of various brands to parade on the streets, constantly "gently advising" passers-by to buy cars. According to "Time" magazine, car company salesmen across the country are currently trying all kinds of methods, even frantically going door-to-door to peddle their wares.

　　Bargain Basement Sale

　　American department stores are generally adopting various methods to please customers and auction off goods at low prices. Daweika Company in New York attracts customers with the slogan "Buying is the road to prosperity." Barriel Company in Pittsburgh is conducting a "crazy fire sale," with a repaired old TV costing only five U.S. dollars. In San Fernando Valley, California, 227 self-proclaimed "crazy merchants" specially select the time from midnight to 3:00 a.m. to sell goods cheaply. One of the stores even provides free food for customers' babies. In Saginaw, Michigan, merchants across the city have joined the "Buy Now" campaign. They have organized street speeches promoting optimistic economic prospects, held "prosperity" dances, and are preparing to hold a "purchase parade" with hundreds of women participating. The Cleveland Chamber of Commerce calls the city "America's Value City," and posters are posted in store windows and cars throughout the city, asking citizens to buy things in stores. To cooperate with the publicity, the New York Advertising Council provides a large number of optimistic economic commentaries to radio stations in various places, and requires the radio stations to broadcast more news about local commercial prosperity.

　　This big performance of promoting goods, which is taking place all over the United States, reflects the capitalist nature of pursuing profits by any means and their anxious mood. However, under the impact of the huge waves of the economic crisis, despite the capitalists' best efforts to desperately promote sales, business has still not improved. The American magazine "Newsweek" reported that even many businessmen doubt that this method will have any "significant and lasting effect." (Long) (Attached picture)

### 推销商品的大演唱

    推销商品的大演唱
    随着经济危机的蔓延和发展，美国的大老板们越来越为堆满仓库的货物发愁了。为了加紧推销存货，资本家们挖空心思地使出五花八门的手法，到处展开大规模的推销运动。
    狂热的推销运动
    据5月一期美国“新闻周刊”报道，美国汽车公司的老板们正在努力使美国人民相信，购买汽车能够帮助战胜经济危机。在“现在就买你的汽车”的口号下，全国二百余个城市已在进行或计划进行大规模的推销运动。纽约市的汽车推销商，决定雇用马戏团的动物和小丑来帮助进行为期十六天的销售运动。于是，近来营业一蹶不振的马戏团便充当汽车公司的推销助手。为了对纽约的二千名汽车推销员打气，不久前，著名的宁格林兄弟马戏团在麦迪逊广场花园里为推销员特别举行了一次“启发性”的演出，这次演出的主持人、雪弗兰汽车的全国推销业务经理包威尔，还配合节目演出向他们传授推销术。他要人人出去推销，并把马戏团的演技运用到推销上去。
    洛杉矶的汽车商想出了更为吸引人的办法。他们雇用奇装异服的女郎，率领由各种牌子的新车组成的车队，在大街上游行，沿途不断“婉言劝告”路人买车。据“时代周刊”报道，目前全国的汽车公司的推销员，正在想尽各种办法，甚至疯狂地穿门越户挨家兜售。
    廉价大拍卖
    美国的大商店正在普遍采用各种讨好顾客的办法，廉价拍卖商品。纽约一家达威卡公司以“购买通到繁荣的道路”的口号招徕顾客。匹兹堡的巴列尔公司进行“疯狂大贱卖”，一架修理过的旧电视机只要五元美金。加利福尼亚州的圣·弗兰多谷，二百二十七家自称“疯狂的商人”专门挑选午夜十二时至清晨三时为廉价抛售商品的时间，其中有一家商店对顾客携带的婴孩还免费供给食品。在密执安州的沙基劳市，全城商人投入了“现在就买”运动，他们组织了宣传经济前途乐观的街头演讲，举办“繁荣”舞会，还准备举行数百名妇女参加的“购买游行”。克里夫兰的市商会，称这个城市为“美国有价值城”，全市商店橱窗和汽车都张贴了招贴，要求市民到商店里购买东西。为了配合宣传，纽约广告商理事会大量供给各地电台乐观的经济短评，并要求各电台多多广播本地商业景气的消息。
    美国各地正在进行着的这出推销商品的大演唱，反映了资本家不择手段地追求利润的本性和他们的焦虑心情。但是，在经济危机巨浪的冲击下，尽管资本家千方百计地拼命推销，生意却仍然没有起色。美国“新闻周刊”报道，连许多商人都怀疑这种办法会有什么“重大和持久的效果”。　（龙）（附图片）
