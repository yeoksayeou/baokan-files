Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 7th May: Jilin Province is coordinating local industry and handicrafts to produce more than 200,000 agricultural machines this year to support agricultural production.

Currently, the province's existing 141 factories in the mechanical and electrical industries are driving more than 700 handicraft production cooperatives, forming a vast collaborative network for agricultural machinery manufacturing. Within this network, mechanical farm implement factories typically handle complex processes such as turning and planing, while blacksmiths, tinsmiths, and woodworking cooperatives produce small parts. In Baicheng County, a large producer of windmills, the mechanical farm implement factory serves as the general assembly workshop, organizing eleven units, including a power plant, paper mill, and railway locomotive section, to jointly produce. In four months, they have produced 1,400 windmills, doubling the efficiency compared to relying solely on the farm implement factory. Jiutai County's farm implement factory, when manufacturing waterwheels, also absorbed the tinsmith cooperative to make iron pipes and the blacksmith shop to make chain links, producing 1,000 waterwheels before the spring plowing season. Now, the Jilin Provincial Department of Industry is organizing farm implement factories in the surrounding six or seven counties around six cities with relatively complete mechanical equipment – Changchun, Jilin, Liaoyuan, Tonghua, Yanji, and Baicheng – to conduct larger-scale collaboration, jointly manufacturing more complex power machinery such as gas engines and electric motors. They are also establishing central lathe repair and fitting factories to gradually overhaul existing outdated lathes or convert them into lathes capable of manufacturing complex farm implements.

Most of the existing mechanical and electrical factories in Jilin Province have outdated equipment and weak technical capabilities. In the past, some factories one-sidedly emphasized output value and profits, only repairing general industrial equipment, fitting parts, and manufacturing some improved farm tools. Sometimes, they would trial-produce one or two new-style farm implements, but fearing losses, they often stopped halfway, and technical development was very slow. This year, these factories and related handicraft cooperatives launched a large-scale debate in the "Double-Anti" movement, criticizing the ideology of only pursuing profits and neglecting service to agriculture, further correcting the direction of production. Their enthusiasm for trial-manufacturing and producing agricultural machinery has generally increased. As of now, they have manufactured and are trial-manufacturing 65 main types of agricultural machinery. Among them, power machinery includes gas engines, generators, and electric motors; agricultural machinery includes universal tractors of different horsepower, seeders, rice transplanters, water pumps, and various agricultural crop processing machinery.

    一百多个机械厂率领七百多个手工业社
    吉林撒下农业机械制造网
    据新华社长春7日电　吉林省地方工业同手工业协作，要求在今年内生产出二十多万台农业机械，支援农业生产。
    目前，省内现有的一百四十一个机电行业的工厂，带动七百多个手工业生产合作社，形成了一个庞大的农业机械制造协作网。在这个网里，一般由机械农具厂担任复杂的车、刨等工序，铁匠炉、白铁、木工等合作社担任小零件的生产。大量生产风车的白城县，以机械农具厂为总装配车间，组织了发电厂、造纸厂、铁路机务段等十一个单位联合生产，四个月共已生产出一千四百台风车，比单独依靠农具厂生产提高效率一倍。九台县农具厂制造水车，也吸收白铁合作社制造铁管子，铁匠炉制造链环，春耕前生产出了一千台水车。现在吉林省工业厅又以长春、吉林、辽源、通化、延吉、白城等六个机械设备比较齐全的城市为中心，各组织周围六、七个县的农具厂，进行更大规模的协作，共同制造煤气机、电动机等比较复杂的动力机械；并建立中心车床修配厂，逐步对现有陈旧的车床进行检修，或改装成能制造复杂农具的车床。
    吉林省现有机电行业的工厂，大部分设备陈旧，技术力量薄弱。过去有些工厂片面强调产值和上缴利润，只修理一般工业器材、配制零件和制造一些改良农具。有时也试制一两台新式农具，但是怕赔本，常常中途停止，技术上发展很慢。今年这些厂以及有关的手工业合作社，在双反运动中展开大辩论，批判只顾追求利润、忽视为农业服务的思想，进一步端正了生产方向。他们试制和生产农业机械的积极性普遍提高，截至目前，已经制造和正在试制的主要农业机械有六十五种。其中，动力机械有煤气机、发电机、电动机；农业机械有不同马力的万能拖拉机、播种机、水田插秧机、水泵以及各种农作物加工机械等。
