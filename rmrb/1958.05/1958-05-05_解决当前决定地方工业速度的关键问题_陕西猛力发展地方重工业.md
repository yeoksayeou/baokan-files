Solving the Key Issues Currently Determining the Speed of Local Industry
Shaanxi Vigorously Develops Local Heavy Industry

(Our newspaper, Xi'an dispatch) Reporter Wu Gang reports: Relying on self-reliance and strengthening the basic industrial construction of related material production is an important issue in the current development of local industry. Shaanxi Province is working to solve this problem.

The development speed of local industry in Shaanxi Province is very fast. In less than two months, more than 2,100 small factories and mines have been established. The problem now encountered is that materials and equipment cannot keep up with the needs of construction. It is estimated that the province as a whole lacks 56,000 tons of steel, 62,000 tons of iron, and large quantities of cement, wood, as well as various construction equipment such as motors, water pumps, and boilers. The mechanical manufacturing capacity of Shaanxi is large, and most of the equipment needed for local industry can be manufactured, but cannot be manufactured due to the lack of materials.

The relevant leading departments of Shaanxi Province have discovered this problem. They believe that the current phenomenon of material shortage reflects a good trend in construction development, and efforts must be made immediately to make material production keep up. The way to solve this problem is to rely on self-reliance, for everyone to take action, focusing on small scale, strengthening the production of construction materials, striving to meet the needs of construction this year, and laying the foundation for the future. At the same time, we must oppose the idea of simply waiting for state allocations, otherwise it will affect the speed of local industrial development. The relevant leading organs proposed to solve the problem of material shortage from the following three aspects:

First, vigorously develop the construction of small-scale heavy industry. Shaanxi Province has the conditions to develop material production. The known reserves of oil shale in the province are initially estimated to be at least 5 billion tons; half of the counties have coal reserves; more than 20 counties have iron ore, and funds are not a problem. Technical equipment and other issues of small-scale factories and mines are also easy to solve. Based on these conditions, the relevant leading departments are making appropriate adjustments to the current local industrial construction projects based on priorities. We must build as many small, indigenous blast furnaces as possible, striving to build a production capacity of 100,000 tons, and increase the original preliminary plan to produce 10,000 tons of iron this year to 30,000 to 50,000 tons. In areas with conditions for developing iron smelting and various non-ferrous metals, do as much as possible. Adopt the method of decentralized iron smelting and centralized steelmaking. In addition to iron smelting in various places, establish a steelmaking plant in Xi'an. Establish several low-grade cement plants, with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons this year, striving to produce 50,000 to 70,000 tons this year. This year, we will also establish 20 small-scale indigenous oil refineries to extract oil from oil shale, and promote them on a large scale next year; at the same time, we will plan to build a larger oil shale refinery: establish several coal refining plants. In addition, the original preliminary plan to build a large fertilizer plant in three years has been revised, and the construction of 36 small fertilizer plants will begin this year, striving to put five into production this year.

Second, give full play to the potential of existing equipment and materials. Many state-owned factories in the Xi'an area have low equipment utilization rates, and some are completely idle; many factories have repair workshops, and the workshops have repair teams. If we organize collaboration and make full use of idle equipment, it is estimated that the equipment withdrawn can equip each county with a comprehensive mechanical manufacturing plant. The relevant departments have decided to complete the Xingping-Baoji high-voltage transmission line, originally scheduled for completion next year, this year. By spending only 3 million yuan, they can supply Baoji, which lacks electricity, with the electricity that Xi'an cannot use up, and extract 21,000 kilowatts of power generation equipment from Baoji for the construction needs of various places.

Another is to take out existing stagnant materials from the warehouse and try every means to save raw materials. Recently, Xi'an City cleared out 3,000 tons of steel in the warehouse. They also proposed that if the water scoops of the original iron Liberation-style waterwheel are changed to wooden ones, the province can save 650,000 jin of pig iron this year.

Now, counties with conditions for developing basic industries are accelerating construction in this area. Hancheng plans to build a small coking plant, a small iron smelting plant, and expand four small coal mines. This year, it will produce 6,000 tons of iron, 10,000 tons of coke, and 60,000 tons of coal. Originally, the county needed 1,000 tons of iron to manufacture agricultural implements, and the province could only supply 26 tons. After this iron plant is put into production in June this year, it will not only meet the needs of the county but also be able to transfer a part of it to other places. Shanyang County has taken various measures to build a copper smelting plant and a small coal mine in less than two months. Other counties are also working hard to accelerate the construction of small iron plants, low-grade cement plants, and fertilizer plants.

    解决当前决定地方工业速度的关键问题
    陕西猛力发展地方重工业
    本报西安讯　记者吴钢报道：依靠自力更生、加强有关材料生产的基础工业建设，是当前发展地方工业的一个重要问题。陕西省正着手解决这个问题。
    陕西省地方工业的发展速度很快。在不到两个月内，已办起两千一百多个小厂矿。现在所遇到的问题，是材料、设备赶不上建设的需要。据估计：全省共缺五万六千吨钢、六万二千吨铁以及大量的水泥、木材，还有电动机、水泵、锅炉等各种建设所需的设备。陕西地区的机械制造能力很大，绝大部分地方工业所需要的设备都可制造，但是因为材料缺乏，不能制造。
    陕西省有关领导部门发现了这个问题，他们认为：目前出现材料缺乏的现象，是反映了建设发展的好现象，必须立即设法使材料生产赶上去。解决这个问题的办法，要依靠自力更生，大家动手，以小型为主，加强建设材料的生产，争取满足今年建设的需要，并为今后打下基础。同时，要反对单纯等待国家调拨的思想，否则就要影响地方工业的发展速度。有关领导机关提出从下列三个方面来解决材料缺乏的问题：
    首先是大力发展小型的重工业建设。陕西省完全有发展材料生产的条件。已知的全省油母页岩的储量，初步估计至少有五十亿吨；半数的县都有煤的储藏；二十多个县有铁矿，资金也不成问题。小型厂矿的技术设备等问题也容易解决。根据这些条件，有关领导部门正把现在的地方工业建设项目，按轻重缓急初步作了适当的调整。要尽量多建一些小型土高炉，争取建设生产能力达到十万吨，把原来初步确定今年生产一万吨铁的计划，增加到三万到五万吨。在有条件发展炼铁和各种有色金属的地区，能搞的尽量去搞。采取分散炼铁、集中炼钢的办法，除各地炼铁外，在西安建立一个炼钢厂。建立若干低标号水泥厂，今年建设年产能力达到十万吨，争取今年生产五万到七万吨。今年还要建立二十个小型土法炼油厂，从油母页岩中提炼石油，明年再大量推广；同时筹建一处较大的油母页岩炼油厂：建立若干煤炼油厂。此外，修改了原来初步提出的三年建设一个大化肥厂的计划，今年开始建设三十六个小型化肥厂，争取五个在今年投入生产。
    其次，发挥现有设备、材料的潜力。西安地区现有许多国营工厂的设备利用率不高，有的完全闲置着；不少厂有修配车间，车间又有修理小组。如果组织协作和充分利用闲置的设备，估计抽出的设备就可给各县装备一个综合机械制造工厂。有关部门已决定把原定明年完成的兴平至宝鸡的高压输电线，提前在今年完成，只花三百万元，就可把当前西安用不完的电，供应缺电的宝鸡，从宝鸡抽出折合二万一千多瓩的发电设备，供各地建设需要。
    再一个是从仓库中拿出现有呆滞材料，千方百计节约原材料。最近，西安市在清仓中，就清理出了三千吨钢材。他们还提出如把原铁制解放式水车的水箥箕改为木制，今年全省即可节省出六十五万斤灰生铁。
    现在，有条件发展基础工业的各县，正在加速这方面建设。韩城计划建设一个小型炼焦厂、一个小型炼铁厂和扩建四个小型煤矿，今年要生产六千吨铁、一万吨焦炭和六万吨煤。原来全县制造农具需要一千吨铁，省里只能供应二十六吨，今年6月这个铁厂投入生产后，不但可以满足本县需要，还可外调一部分。山阳县采取各种措施，在不到两个月期间，建设起一个炼铜厂和小煤矿，其他各县也都在努力加速小型铁厂、低标号水泥厂、化肥厂的建设。
