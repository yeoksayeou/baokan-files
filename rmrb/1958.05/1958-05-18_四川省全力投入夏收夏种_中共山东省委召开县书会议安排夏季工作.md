　　Sichuan Province Fully Invests in Summer Harvesting and Planting
    Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party Convenes County Party Secretary Meeting to Arrange Summer Work
    (Our Reporter Ji Xichen) Sichuan has mobilized the entire party and all the people to fully invest in summer harvesting and planting. This year, the province's 50 million mu of wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests, with a general increase of 15%, usually a 20% increase, and some even reaching more than double. The mountainous areas, hills, and plains are all reporting bumper harvests. Recently, continuous rain and falling temperatures have caused great difficulties for summer harvesting and planting, but thanks to the personal leadership of party committee secretaries at all levels, the promotion of revolutionary vigor and initiative, and the implementation of leadership methods that focus on ideology, organization, technology, and collaboration, the summer harvesting and planting work is being done early, quickly, abundantly, and well.

    In conjunction with discussions on how to overcome disasters and ensure bumper harvests, many places have organized debates on rushing the harvest and planting, educating commune members to fully recognize the great significance of summer harvest for the country, the collective, and individuals, and to overcome the passive thinking of waiting for sunny days. Through a major debate, Wanxian County, under the slogan of "Work hard in light rain, work even harder in light rain, work together day and night," mobilized all county, district, and township cadres to organize the county's people to rush the harvest in the rain, and completed the harvest of 530,000 mu of spring crops in just five or six days. More than 2,600 cooperatives in Nanbu County have universally achieved "harvest a piece as it ripens, cultivate a piece, and plant a piece." In order to solve the contradiction of labor shortages, many cooperatives have adopted the method of "categorizing agricultural work, arranging labor in teams, contracting responsibility, and interlocking with each other," so that harvesting, grain picking, transporting, plowing, and transplanting rice seedlings are all the responsibility of specific people. This achieves simultaneous harvesting, threshing, drying, cultivating, and planting, avoiding labor waste and grain waste. As a result, while rushing to harvest 680,000 mu of spring crops, the county also planted most of the mid-season rice, sweet potatoes, and cotton.

    (Our Report) From May 9th to 12th, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of county party secretaries to inspect and arrange preparatory work for the summer harvest and planting, and to mobilize the entire party and all the people to take urgent action in a fighting posture.

    Shandong Province's wheat is currently in the flowering and grain-filling stage, with less than a month before harvest. In this short period of time, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the late-stage management of 60 million mu of wheat fields, and to do a good job of summer harvesting, planting, and field management of autumn crops. It is also necessary to do a good job of procurement and distribution, and at the same time, seize the short opportunity before the wheat harvest and the flood season to carry out two water conservancy blitzes and do a good job of flood prevention, as well as create the necessary conditions for striving for a great leap forward in wheat next year. To this end, the meeting required party and government leading organs at all levels to immediately make proper arrangements for all aspects of work, comprehensively grasp them, and carry them out in an orderly manner. The meeting also put forward specific requirements for the above-mentioned tasks respectively:

    First of all, it is necessary to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields. All areas with water conservancy conditions should universally irrigate them once. For high-yield fields that may lodge, active measures should be taken to proactively prevent them, and pests should be eliminated in a timely manner. Before the wheat harvest, leaders at all levels should select counties, townships, cooperatives, and high-yield fields with high wheat yields to hold a wheat on-site meeting to summarize and exchange experience in increasing production, and to prepare for a great leap forward in wheat production next year. In particular, it is necessary to identify excellent varieties on a county-by-county basis and carry out mass appraisal of good varieties. Agricultural cooperatives and production teams should all set up wheat harvest plans and properly arrange labor, striving to complete the harvest in five to seven days per cooperative.

    Summer planting must first of all seize the time and strive for the initiative, requiring that sowing be completed ten days to half a month earlier this year than in previous years.

    Counties, townships, and cooperatives should all organize forces to check seedlings and replant them, ensuring that no seedling is missing.

    Many new projects this year have not yet been tested. We must overcome any侥幸麻痹(Jiaoxing Mabi: lucky paralysis, meaning complacency) and make all flood prevention preparations as early as possible.

    In order to make necessary preparations for striving for a great leap forward in wheat production next year, all localities should universally hold wheat on-site meetings in May to summarize experience in increasing production and evaluate good varieties. In particular, through vigorously grasping pig raising and making smoked fertilizer, it is necessary to prepare sufficient fertilizer for autumn planting, and ensure the realization of the plan to apply 10,000 jin of base fertilizer and 5,000 jin of top dressing per mu.

    In accordance with the principle that agricultural cooperatives calculate the total income and distribute it once a year, the summer pre-distribution this year should greatly simplify procedures and adopt a pre-payment method to facilitate concentrating forces to blitz the summer harvest and planting.

    The meeting believes that the key to doing a good job in the above-mentioned work lies in strengthening the leadership of party committees at all levels and conscientiously implementing the work method of the mass line. In accordance with the spirit of taking rectification as the command and production as the center, all localities must, while resolutely doing a good job in rectification, uniformly organize various tasks, concretely assign responsibilities, strengthen cooperation between cooperatives, organize a mass inspection and comparison, and conscientiously do a good job in all preparations.

　　四川省全力投入夏收夏种
    中共山东省委召开县书会议安排夏季工作
    本报讯　记者纪希晨报道：四川全党全民总动员，全力投入夏收夏种。今年全省五千万亩小麦、油菜、胡豆、豌豆空前丰收，普遍增产15％，一般都增产两成，有的则达到一倍以上，山区丘陵平原一片丰收声。近来各地虽阴雨连绵，气温下降，使夏收夏种工作遭遇很大困难，但由于各级党委书记亲自挂帅，发挥革命干劲和首创精神，实行了抓思想、抓组织、抓技术、抓协作的领导方法，使夏收夏种工作做的又早又快又多又好。
    结合讨论如何战胜灾害确保丰收，许多地方组织了抢收抢种的辩论，教育社员从思想上充分认识夏收对国家、集体和个人的巨大意义，克服坐待天晴的消极思想。万县通过大辩论，在“大雨小干，小雨大干，白天晚上一齐干”的口号下，县区乡干部全部出动组织全县人民冒雨抢收，只奋战五六天就把五十三万亩小春收完了。南部县二千六百多个社普遍做到“黄一块，收一块，耕一块，种一块”，为解决劳动力紧张矛盾，许多社采用“农活分类，劳力排队，包干负责，互相衔接”的办法，使收割、拣粮、挑运、犁耙、栽秧都有专人负责。做到边收、边打、边晒、边耕、边栽，避免了劳力窝工和粮食浪费。因之全县在抢收六十八万亩小春作物的同时，也把绝大部分中稻、红苕、棉花都栽种上了。
    本报讯　中共山东省委5月9日到12日召开县委书记会议，检查、布置夏收、夏种准备工作，动员全党全民以战斗姿态紧急行动起来。
    山东省目前小麦已开始扬花鼓粒，离收割仅有不到一个月的时间。在这段短促的时间里，既要继续加强六千万亩麦田的后期管理，并搞好夏收、夏种和大秋作物田间管理，又要作好征购、分配工作，同时，还要抓住麦前汛前短暂的时机进行两次水利突击和做好防汛工作，以及为争取明年小麦大跃进创造必要的条件。为此，会议要求各级党政领导机关，立即把各方面工作加以妥善安排，全面抓好，有秩序地进行。会议并对上述各项工作分别提出了具体的要求：
    首先要加强麦田后期管理，凡是有水利条件的地区，都要普浇一次水；对于可能倒伏的高额丰产田，要积极采取措施，主动加以防止，并及时消灭虫害。各级领导在麦收前，都要选择小麦丰产的县、乡、社和丰产田，召开一次小麦现场会议，总结交流增产经验，为明年小麦生产大跃进做好准备。特别要以县为单位，把优良品种肯定下来，开展群众性的评选良种工作。农业社、生产队都要定出麦收计划，把劳力安排妥当，以社为单位争取五天至七天收割完毕。
    夏种工作首先要抢时间、争主动，要求今年比往年提前十天到半月播完种。
    县、乡、社都要组织力量，查苗补苗，作到一苗不缺。
    今年许多新做的工程尚未经过考验，必须克服任何侥幸麻痹心理，及早作好一切防汛准备工作。
    为争取明年小麦生产大跃进作好必要的准备，各地5月份普遍开好小麦现场会，总结增产经验，评选良种。特别要通过大力抓养猪、搞熏肥等办法，为秋种准备好充足的肥料，保证实现每亩施底肥一万斤，追肥五千斤的计划。
    各地应本着农业社收益全年统算一次分配的原则，对今年夏季预分要大大简化手续，采取预支的办法，以利于集中力量突击夏收、夏种。
    会议认为，搞好上述工作的关键在于加强各级党委的领导，认真贯彻群众路线的工作方法。根据以整风为统帅、生产为中心的精神，各地必须在坚决搞好整风的同时，对各项任务要统一组织，具体分工负责，并加强合作社的领导，要组织一次群众性的检查评比，切实作好各项准备工作。
