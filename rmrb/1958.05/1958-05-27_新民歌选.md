Selected New Folk Songs

    I Have Arrived
  There is no Jade Emperor in heaven,
  There is no Dragon King on earth,
  I am the Jade Emperor,
  I am the Dragon King,
  Ordering the Three Mountains and Five Ridges to clear the way:
  I have arrived.
        (Ankang, Shaanxi)
  Guiding Light
  Magpies chirp happily in the trees,
  The old man grins, unable to contain his laughter.
  The Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program,
  Are like forty suns shining overhead.
  Even the sun cannot compare to its warmth,
  It shines everywhere.
  Listen closely,
  Isn't that the voice of Chairman Mao?
  Hold it close to your heart,
  Every word warms the soul,
  Unable to keep his mouth shut, he burst out laughing,
  Our commune members have a guiding light.
            (Jiangsu)
  Crossing the Yangtze River
  Ten thousand catties of sweet potatoes, a thousand catties of grain,
  Riding a rocket across the Yangtze River.
  White rice will be harvested in the sky
  Terraced fields are like tall buildings,
  Only nine feet nine inches from the sky,
  Halfway up into the clouds,
  White rice will be harvested in the sky.
          (Yunxian, Hubei)
  Yesterday I Passed Through the Eastern Village
  Yesterday I passed through the eastern village,
  Every door was locked,
  Leaving yellow dogs barking,
  Leaving roosters crowing.
  A piece of paper on the door,
  Words written with a brush, not many words:
  "Our commune wants to achieve a thousand catties per mu,
  No one has time to sit at home,
  If relatives and friends want to meet villagers,
  They will have to wait until sunset."
          (Hengyang, Hunan)
  Blowing, Plucking, and Singing
  Producing and fighting in the fields,
  Blowing, plucking, and singing by the fields.
  Singing the Bangzi opera tune,
  Thinking of the Communist Party in our hearts.
          (Yuxian, Henan)
    Missing Mother
  Long time no see, mother, I miss mother,
  Seeing mother at home is also ordinary,
  Wake up in the middle of the night, heart racing,
  Tomorrow the commune will be digging ponds.
          (Feixi, Anhui)
  Sister Carries the Load Closely Behind
  Brother carries the embankment quickly as if flying,
  Sister carries the load closely behind,
  Even if you fly into the white clouds,
  I will desperately catch up with you.
          (Macheng, Hubei)

    我来了
  天上没有玉皇，
  地上没有龙王，
  我就是玉皇，
  我就是龙王，
  喝令三山五岭开道：
  我来了。
        （陕西安康）
  指路明灯
  树上喜鹊喳喳地叫，
  老汉咧嘴忍不住的笑。
  农业发展纲要四十条，
  好比四十颗太阳当头照。
  太阳也比不上它温暖，
  处处地方它都照到。
  放近耳朵听一听，
  莫不是毛主席的说话声？
  回头胸上贴一贴，
  句句话它暖人心，
  没闭住嘴巴笑出了声，
  咱社员有了指路的大明灯。
            （江苏）
  过长江
  万斤地瓜千斤粮，
  坐着火箭过长江。
  白米要到天上收
  层层梯田像高楼，
  离天只有九尺九，
  半截伸在云里头，
  白米要到天上收。
          （湖北郧县）
  昨天我走东村过
  昨天我走东村过，
  家家门上挂了锁，
  留下黄狗汪汪叫，
  留下公鸡在唱歌。
  大门板上纸一张，
  毛笔写字字不多：
  “我社要搞千斤社，
  没有闲人家中坐，
  亲朋要会村里人，
  只好等到日头落”。
          （湖南衡阳）
  吹拉弹唱
  生产战斗在田间，
  吹拉弹唱地头边。
  嘴里唱着梆子腔，
  心里想着共产党。
          （河南禹县）
    想娘
  久不见娘心想娘，
  回家见娘也平常，
  睡到半夜心又急，
  明日社里要挑塘。
          （安徽肥西）
  妹挑担子紧紧追
  情哥挑堤快如飞，
  妹挑担子紧紧追，
  就是飞进白云里，
  也要拼命赶上你。
          （湖北麻城）
