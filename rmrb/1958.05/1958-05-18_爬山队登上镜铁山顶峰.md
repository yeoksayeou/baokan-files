Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 16th: Climbing athletes from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and geological workers from Jingtieshan, braving blizzards and overcoming hypoxia and extreme cold, successfully ascended the main peak of Jingtieshan – Daolong Shangrui.

On April 27th, the climbing athletes and geological workers set off from Daolong Yaogongma and immediately encountered heavy blizzards. Braving strong winds and bitter cold, they climbed over three snow-capped mountains and arrived at the foot of Daolong Shangrui Peak on the 30th. To prepare for the assault on the main peak, the climbing athletes helped the geological workers with climbing exercises and equipment checks.

On the morning of May Day, the athletes and geological workers mustered their energy and set off towards the main peak in three groups. The snow mountain was full of towering cliffs with slopes of about seventy degrees. They hammered ice screws into the smooth ice slopes and rock screws into the rocks, using nylon ropes to climb. That day, due to hypoxia, difficulty breathing, and extreme physical fatigue, they did not continue climbing. The next day, they climbed over one to two meters of snow covering the ice slope, carefully crawled over the dangerous ice slope, and suddenly discovered ore. According to the needs of geological work, they pitched tents halfway up the mountain and stayed overnight.

On May 3rd, the climbing athletes and geological workers finally overcame all kinds of dangers and climbed to the summit at an altitude of more than 5,100 meters, where the three groups successfully converged. The climbing athletes and geological workers carried out geological work on the summit, collecting valuable geological data.

　　爬山队登上镜铁山顶峰
    新华社兰州16日电　中华全国总工会的爬山运动员和镜铁山地质工作者，冲破暴风雪的袭击，战胜了缺氧和奇寒，胜利地攀登上镜铁山主峰——道龙上瑞。
    爬山运动员和地质工作者们在4月27日从道龙要公玛出发，就碰到大风雪，他们冒劲风严寒爬过三座雪山，30日来到道龙上瑞峰下。为了做好向主峰冲锋的准备工作，爬山运动员帮助地质工作者进行爬山锻炼，检查装备。
    “五一”早晨，运动员和地质工作者鼓足干劲，分三组向主峰进发。雪山上峭壁林立，坡度有七十度左右。他们在光滑的冰坡上钉上冰锥，岩石上钉上岩石锥，拴上尼龙绳爬行。这天因为缺氧呼吸困难，身体过度疲劳，没继续攀登。第二天他们爬过冰坡上复盖的一至二公尺厚的雪，小心地匍伏爬过危险的冰坡，突然发现矿石，根据地质工作的需要，他们在半山腰扎下帐篷住了一夜。
    5月3日，爬山运动员和地质工作者们终于战胜了各种艰险，攀登上海拔五千一百多公尺的顶峰，三个组胜利会师了。爬山运动员和地质工作者在顶岛上进行地质工作，搜集珍贵的地质资料。
