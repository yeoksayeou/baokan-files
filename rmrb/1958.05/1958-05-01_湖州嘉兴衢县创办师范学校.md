    湖州嘉兴衢县创办师范学校
    本报讯　为了适应农业生产和文化教育事业大跃进，最近浙江省湖州、嘉兴、衢县创办四所大学。
    嘉兴专区第一所培养农业中学师资的高等学校——湖州师范专科学校已在4月26日开学。这所学校是根据勤俭办学的原则，充分利用湖州师范学校原有的设备和人力办起来的。这所学校第一期设两个班，共有八十二名学生，这些学生都是从小学教师、社会青年中选送的。这所学校根据农业中学的需要，开设语文、数学、农业知识、化学、政治、心理学等课。为了使教学联系实际，学校还选择了白雀乡农业中学作为“试验田”，进行教学实习。嘉兴专区另一所高等学校——嘉兴师范专科学校正在进行招生，不久即将开学。
    衢县新设的两所大学——农业大学和师范专科学校各招生五十名，已在4月底开学。
