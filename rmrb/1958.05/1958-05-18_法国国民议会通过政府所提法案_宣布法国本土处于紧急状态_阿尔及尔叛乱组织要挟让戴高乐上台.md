Xinhua News Agency, May 17th, Paris Dispatch: The French National Assembly, in a special session on the evening of the 16th, passed by an overwhelming majority of 461 votes to 114, a bill authorizing the government to declare a state of emergency in metropolitan France. This bill was subsequently passed in the Senate of the Republic by a majority of 211 votes to 94, thus taking effect immediately.

According to this bill, for the next three months, the government has the power to prohibit all gatherings or demonstrations, arrest any citizen, conduct searches day and night, impose comprehensive control over newspapers and radio stations, confiscate weapons, and close theaters and cafes.

In order to appease right-wing forces, Pflimlin, in his concluding remarks before the end of the debate, even stated that he was not prepared to rely on the support of Communist Party members in the vote. He also hinted that the government would also use this emergency state law to suppress the activities of left-wing progressive forces, and would not just "unilaterally" use it to deal with fascist provocations.

Maurice Thorez, leader of the French Communist Party parliamentary group, announced before the vote that the Communists would do their utmost to participate in the defense of the republican system. He said that, considering the current situation, the Communist Party would vote in favor of the government's bill. Maurice Thorez, Secretary-General of the French Communist Party, also attended this special session of the National Assembly.

Socialist Party member, Nacherand, accused De Gaulle's statement of being a threat to public freedom. He said, "De Gaulle, bypassing the state, declared to the country that he wanted to seize all power, which is to implement a dictatorship." He called on all workers and all supporters of the republican system not to allow this arrogant demand to succeed. Nacherand's speech received applause from Communist Party members to centrist members. Although Socialist Party leader, Mollet, felt "uneasy" about the meaning of De Gaulle's statement in his speech, he simultaneously touted De Gaulle's role during the war.

Many right-wing party members tried in their speeches to justify the fascist rebellion that broke out in Algeria and De Gaulle's ambitions.

A number of Popular Republican Party members withdrew from the meeting because they were dissatisfied with the speech given by the party's honorary vice-chairman, Bidault, who was touting for De Gaulle.

President Coty held a series of talks throughout the 16th with French high-ranking officer Alphonse Juin, right-wing "Independent Party" leader, Roger Duchet, Radical Socialist Party's Mendes France, former Resident Minister of Algeria, Lacoste, and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, Paul Ély.

The situation in Paris remains tense. Highly explosive bombs were found placed in the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of the Interior buildings on the morning of the 16th. No explosions occurred due to the timely removal by the police. Prime Minister Pflimlin's country villa was bombed on the night of the 15th, destroying a portion of it. Housewives are lining up in long queues busy scrambling to buy food and other necessities in preparation for possible changes in the situation.

On the evening of the 16th, the French Ministry of Defense ordered all officers and soldiers on vacation to immediately report to the military region headquarters where they were on leave to cancel their vacations. Soldiers of the French forces stationed in North Africa who are on vacation in metropolitan France have been ordered not to return to their original posts.

According to a report in the Paris "Le Monde" on the 16th, several officers (including several generals) have been arrested on the evening of the 15th for involvement in subversive activities. In addition, the government issued a communique stating that it has banned the four extreme right-wing organizations, "People's Revolutionary Party," "Youth National Movement," "National Action Front," and "French Fascist Party."

In Algeria, fascist rebels have established the "Committee of Public Safety" of Algiers on the 16th as a central organization to lead similar organizations in various places. There are reports that French colonialists and colonial military leaders in the region are brewing a so-called "revolutionary government" in Algeria to help De Gaulle come to power.

The Algiers "Committee of Public Safety" issued a statement on the evening of the 16th, openly threatening President Coty and the National Assembly to accept a government led by De Gaulle.

　　法国国民议会通过政府所提法案
　　宣布法国本土处于紧急状态
　　阿尔及尔叛乱组织要挟让戴高乐上台
    据新华社17日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会特别会议16日傍晚以四百六十一票对一百一十四票的压倒多数通过了授权政府宣布法国本土处于紧急状态的法案。这个法案随后又在共和国参议院以二百一十一票对九十四票的多数通过，从而立即开始生效。
    根据这个法案，在未来的三个月里，政府有权禁止一切集会或游行、逮捕任何公民、不分昼夜进行搜查、对报刊和电台实施全面管制、没收武器以及封闭影剧院和咖啡馆等。
    为了讨好右翼势力，弗林姆兰在辩论结束前的总结发言中竟表示，他在表决中不准备依靠共产党议员的支持。他还暗示，政府也将利用这项紧急状态法案来镇压左翼进步力量的活动，而不会只是“单方面地”用它来对付法西斯挑衅。
    法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在投票前宣布，共产党人将尽他们的全力参加保卫共和制度。他说，考虑到目前的形势，共产党将投票支持政府的法案。法国共产党总书记多列士也出席了这次国民议会特别会议。
    社会党议员纳歇朗指责戴高乐的声明是对公众自由的威胁。他说，“戴高乐越过国家，向全国声明要掌握一切权力，这就是要实行独裁。”他呼吁全体工人和全体拥护共和制度的人不要让这种狂妄的要求得逞。纳歇朗的发言获得了从共产党议员到中间派议员的鼓掌。社会党领袖摩勒在发言中虽然对戴高乐声明的含义感到“不安”，但同时却吹嘘戴高乐在战时的作用。
    不少右翼党派的议员在发言中力图替阿尔及利亚爆发的法西斯叛乱和戴高乐的野心进行辩解。
    一部分人民共和党议员由于不满意该党名誉副主席皮杜尔替戴高乐捧场的发言而退出了会场。
    总统戈蒂16日一整天分别同法国最高级军官阿方斯·许温、右翼“独立党”领袖罗歇·杜协、激进社会党的孟戴斯—弗朗斯、前阿尔及利亚驻节部长拉戈斯特和武装部队参谋长保罗·埃利等举行了一系列会谈。
    巴黎市内情况仍然紧张。经济部大厦和内政部大厦16日清晨都发现被人置放了烈性炸弹。经警察及时挪走，没有发生爆炸。总理弗林姆兰的乡间别墅15日夜间被人扔炸弹，炸毁了一部分。家庭主妇们排成长队忙着争购粮食和其他生活必需品，准备应付局势可能的变化。
    法国国防部16日晚上命令所有正在度假的官兵立即到他们休假所在地的军区司令部去销假。正在法国本土度假的法国驻北非部队的士兵则被命令不要返回原来的岗位。
    据巴黎“世界报”16日报道，好几名军官（其中包括几名将官）由于同颠覆活动有牵连已经在15日晚间被捕。另外，政府发表公报说，它已经查禁了“人民革命党”、“青年国家运动”、“国家行动阵线”和“法国长枪党”四个极右翼组织。
    在阿尔及利亚，法西斯叛乱分子已经在16日成立了阿尔及尔市“救国委员会”作为领导各地同类组织的中央机构。有消息说，这个地区的法国殖民主义者和殖民军领袖正在酝酿在阿尔及利亚境内组织一个所谓“革命政府”，以便帮助戴高乐上台。
    阿尔及尔“救国委员会”16日晚上发表声明，公开进行威胁，要法国总统戈蒂和国民议会接受戴高乐领导的政府。
