    Small Factories, Big Future
    A few years ago, when the Party called for agricultural collectivization, some people started "pauper cooperatives" with only three donkey legs to their name. Such "pauper cooperatives" later became models for the collectivization movement. Today, the Party is calling on the entire Party and all the people to run industry. Gao County in Sichuan Province has seen the emergence of a small copper factory with only a small blast furnace and a few thatched sheds. Its future, of course, is also foreseeable.
    The reason why running industry like this in Gao County is good is firstly because it's good to make do with whatever is available, and secondly because the combination of industry and agriculture is good. Making do with whatever is available is the hallmark of the diligence and thrift of the Chinese working people; the good thing about combining industry and agriculture is that this combination contains the seeds of communism, that is, being both worker and farmer, knowing both farming and industry, which will gradually eliminate the natural boundaries between farmers and workers. The example of Gao County tells us that no matter how long or how big things are, they all start from the present, from the smallest point. Therefore, the practice of Gao County is worth promoting.

    小工厂　大前途
    几年前，在党号召农业合作化的时候，有人只凭三条驴腿的家当办起了“穷棒子社”。这样的“穷棒子社”，后来成了合作化运动的榜样。今天，党号召全党全民办工业，四川高县就出现了只有一个小高炉和几间草棚子的小铜厂。它的前途，自然也是可以预见得到的。
    高县这样办工业之所以好，第一是因陋就简好，第二是工农结合好。因陋就简地办事，是我国劳动人民勤俭本色；工农结合好，是因为这种结合，孕育着共产主义的因素，这就是亦工亦农，会农又会工，将使农民和工人之间存在的天然界限逐渐消灭。高县的事例告诉我们：无论多么久远的事，多么大的事，都是从现在、从最小处开始的。因此，高县这个做法值得提倡。
