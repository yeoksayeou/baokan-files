Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 29th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" recently published an article commenting on the erroneous arguments in Tito's report to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The article pointed out that Tito attributed the fundamental cause of the formation of the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization by the imperialists to the so-called "Stalin policy." This view is tantamount to finding an excuse for the founders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The article stated that Tito called the period before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union a period of "stagnation and decline" in the international workers' movement. According to this view, the formation and strengthening of the socialist world system that occurred before the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was also the result of this period of "stagnation and decline." We believe this view is unacceptable.

    评铁托在南共大会报告中的错误论点
    新华社布达佩斯29日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”最近发表文章，评论了铁托在南共第七次代表大会上所作报告中的错误论点。
    文章指出，铁托把帝国主义者的侵略性的北大西洋公约组织形成的基本原因归咎于所谓“斯大林政策”，这种观点等于替北大西洋公约组织的建立者找解脱。
    文章说，铁托把苏共第二十次代表大会前的年代称为国际工人运动中的“停滞和衰退”时期，照这样看来，苏共第二十次代表大会以前所发生的社会主义世界体系的形成和加强，也是这个“停滞和衰退”时期的结果了。我们认为这种观点是不能接受的。
