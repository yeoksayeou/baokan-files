Everyone's Opinion

　　“What he says doesn't count…”
　　Xin Sheng Cooperative, Zhuozi County, Inner Mongolia  Xu Rongsheng
    When Chairman Mao recently visited a poor peasant household in the Hongguang Cooperative of Sichuan, he asked the old peasant woman Lin Saihua with concern, "Is the grain ration enough to eat?" Just as the deputy director said, "Last year, each member received an average of over 400 catties of grain...", Chairman Mao said to Lin Saihua, "What he says doesn't count, you tell me, is it really enough to eat?" (See People's Daily, April 12th, second edition)
    "What he says doesn't count, you tell me, is it really enough to eat?" These few humorous words are truly touching. They embody our great leader Chairman Mao's meticulous concern for the masses and his genuine concern for the hardships of the people's lives. Although the deputy director's answer was truthful, Chairman Mao believed that what he said didn't count in order to verify whether it was reliable. Whose words count then? The masses, the ordinary farmers. These few short and humorous words not only moved the masses but also enlightened our vast number of cadres, which is to go deep into reality, deep into the masses, and directly listen to the opinions of the masses, not just listen to reports, not just listen to the opinions of the cadres, but to listen to the reflections of the masses in a down-to-earth manner. Isn't this a typical mass line working method? I think that if our vast number of cadres can learn Chairman Mao's working method of going deep into reality and deep into the masses, then the bureaucratic airs and subjectivism among the cadres will surely be eliminated.

### “他说的不算……”

　　“他说的不算……”
　　内蒙古卓资县新胜社  徐荣生
    毛主席最近在四川红光社访问一户贫农时，关心地问贫农老婆婆林赛华“口粮够不够吃？”副社长刚说了“去年平均每个社员分四百多斤粮……”，毛主席就对林赛华说：“他说的不算，你说，是不是真的够吃？”（见人民日报4月12日第二版报道）
    “他说的不算，你说，是不是真的够吃？”这几句很风趣的话，确实是使人感动。它体现了我们伟大的领袖毛主席无微不至的关心群众，切切实实的关心群众生活疾苦。副社长的回答虽是真实的，但要证实它是否可靠，毛主席却认为他说的不算。谁说的算呢？是群众，是普通的农民。这几句简短而风趣的话，不仅感动了群众，还启发了我们广大干部，这就是要深入实际，深入群众，直接听取群众的意见，不要光听汇报，光听干部的意见，而要踏踏实实地听取群众的反映，这岂不是很典型的群众路线工作方法吗？我想，如果我们广大干部都能学习毛主席这样深入实际、深入群众的工作方法，那末，干部中的官气、主观主义等一定会打掉。
