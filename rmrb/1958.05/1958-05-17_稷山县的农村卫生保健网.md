　　The Rural Health Care Network of Jishan County
　　Yi Yaowen, First Secretary of the Jishan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanxi Province

　　In the spring of 1956, Jishan County, Shanxi Province, on the basis of comprehensively realizing advanced cooperativization, began to establish a set of health care networks adapted to production, so that the county's health movement gradually became regular and institutionalized in terms of propaganda and education, organizational leadership, and medical prevention work.
　　The rural health care network was established by combining state and mass forces, and thoroughly transforming the original joint clinics and private doctors. The county has a People's Hospital, an epidemic prevention station, and a women and children health station, which respectively lead the county's medical, health, epidemic prevention, and women and children's health business and propaganda and education work. In the five market towns, the original joint clinics and public health clinics were merged to form four comprehensive regional hospitals and a larger health clinic, which provide medical guidance to the joint health stations in the area and accept consultations for difficult and complicated diseases from the health stations. In the thirteen townships, the original joint clinics and private clinics were merged and reorganized into thirteen joint health stations and thirteen branch stations, which contracted to carry out medical, preventive, and mass health care work. In the two hundred and twenty-nine natural villages, two hundred and twenty health rooms were established, each with a health box and a health worker, who were responsible for first aid for work injuries, epidemic prevention, new-method delivery, and childcare in the village. In this way, a health care network combining the state and agricultural cooperatives was formed. Such a health care network with medical institutions in every township, health organizations in every cooperative, leadership, dedicated personnel, a mass base, unified medical care and health care, and combined health and production, is a powerful force for developing mass health movements and medical and health care undertakings in rural areas. The practice of the past two years has fully demonstrated its advantages. The main manifestations are:
　　First, it has brought the health and medical undertakings into the socialist track, truly implemented the health work policy of prevention first, and further transformed the old medical personnel ideologically, establishing a new medical style of serving the people. The funding sources for the health care network are: regional hospitals are responsible by the state, with some health care fees as subsidies; health stations adopt a combination of health care fees, medical income, and subsidies from the agricultural cooperative's public welfare fund. This fundamentally solved the contradiction between doctors relying on patients for a living and implementing the principle of prevention first, and transformed the old medical personnel's idea of "the more patients, the higher the income" into the idea of "the fewer patients, the greater the contribution," transforming the old medical institutions and medical personnel economically and ideologically. Due to the change in thinking, a set of systems for serving production and considering the masses has also been established in the work methods. According to the distribution of agricultural cooperatives, the health stations divide the entire township into several responsibility areas, each with a designated doctor responsible for mobile medical services. For example, the thirteen health stations in the county had 115,032 visits in 1956, of which 73,746 were for field and door-to-door mobile medical services, accounting for 64%. In order to solve the problem of doctors not being able to find patients and patients not being able to find doctors, the method of patients registering for illness at the cooperative and doctors visiting and treating according to the registration was adopted. In order to control the spread of infectious diseases, an infectious disease reporting system was established. Once an infectious disease is discovered, the responsible doctor leads the health worker to report and isolate and treat the disease, so as to achieve timely detection, timely reporting, and timely elimination. At the same time, a registration and statistics system for women's menstrual periods and pregnant women has also been established to facilitate women's menstrual leave and prenatal check-ups. Thrift and diligence have become principles that medical personnel consciously abide by. Doctors personally cleaning up houses and repairing tables and chairs has become a common phenomenon.
　　Second, it is not only a professional institution for medical and health care, but also a leading organization for mass health care work, becoming a propagandist and organizer of the mass patriotic health movement. No matter what meeting is held in the cooperative, the health room has a say, and various activities in the countryside are occasions for them to carry out propaganda work. They seize living people and events, and use slogans, posters, cartoons, dramas and other forms to carry out figurative propaganda. In the past two years, 160,000 people in the county have received health knowledge propaganda and education through the health care network, and 470 health workers, 883 midwives, 946 breeders, 2,136 nursery nannies, and 21,180 housewives in agricultural cooperatives have been trained. In addition, under the unified leadership of the township health care committee, the health rooms provide guidance, organize youth shock teams to eliminate the four pests, youth cleaning teams, temporary inspection groups of youth and children, and activities such as dividing health areas and responsibility areas, formulating health covenants, and regularly summarizing and exchanging experiences and checking and comparing, all of which prove that the health care network is an extremely effective organizational form to ensure the successful implementation of rural health care work and the development of mass health movements.
　　Third, it embodies the significant role of health care directly serving production and promotes the movement to increase agricultural production. Because the health care network is closely integrated with the township and cooperative, the content and methods of health care work are also closely centered on agricultural production, giving play to the role of directly serving production. The mass health movement of "five combinations" carried out under the organization and promotion of the health care network, which combines environmental sanitation with fertilizer accumulation, rat and sparrow extermination with grain protection, breeding hygiene with livestock protection, family hygiene with thrift and diligence, and field hygiene with labor protection, is a good proof. Since September 1957, sweeping, tidying up toilets, digging pupae, digging circle bottoms, etc., have accumulated a total of 3.5 million large carts of fertilizer (1,500 catties per cart), and each mu of the county's 720,000 mu of arable land can increase fertilizer application by five large carts. In terms of livestock health care, in addition to the establishment of five veterinary stations in five market towns and the training of more than 220 veterinarians by the County Agriculture and Forestry Bureau who were assigned to each cooperative to do disease prevention and control work, the health stations in each township are also responsible for the prevention and control of animal plagues and the guidance of livestock health care. Each health station can regularly hold symposiums for breeders to summarize and promote good breeding experiences. The "livestock feeding classification queuing" method of Taiyang Village (classification queuing according to the speed of eating grass, the size of livestock, the age of livestock, and the type of livestock), the feeding responsibility system of Renhe Cooperative, and the "three-fixed use of draught animals" method (fixed farm work, fixed draught animals, and fixed special personnel for use) have been promoted in different ranges. Attention has been paid to the hygiene of livestock sheds, feed, feeding utensils, drinking water, etc., and therefore, the mortality and morbidity of draught animals have been greatly reduced. In terms of family hygiene, each health station trained housewives, mobilized everyone to formulate dietary rules, put forward the slogan of "economical, hygienic, and delicious," and carried out family hygiene competitions and children's health competitions, thereby beginning to change people's living environment and lifestyle. In terms of labor protection, each health station attaches importance to health education for cooperative members in field labor; implements the system of "two brings, four preventions, and three on time" (bring boiled water, bring straw hats, prevent heatstroke, prevent injuries, prevent fires, prevent freezing, go to the field on time, leave the field on time, and eat on time); conducts regular health check-ups for cooperative members, and according to the check-up results, suggests that cooperatives and teams assign work reasonably according to the degree of health and physical conditions, and health files have been established for the health status of each cooperative member in the health stations of many villages. Nurseries have been set up in every village, and kindergartens have been popularized throughout the county; the registration system for women's menstrual periods and pregnancy has been implemented, and the system of leave before and after childbirth has been stipulated. New methods of delivery have been generally implemented, changing the old habit of pregnant women only drinking thin rice soup. At present, the county is further carrying out family planning work.
　　Now the masses have realized the benefits of the health care network. Their conclusion is: "In the past, the joint clinic had few people and high profits. When the masses were sick, doctors could not be invited. After the establishment of the health station, things have completely changed. Doctors come to the door, and the whole family is safe and sound. If it weren't for the new society, I couldn't even dream of it." "In the past, doctors had a big air, and they couldn't be invited without cars, horses, wine, and banquets. Now, doctors have dismounted and check the diseases of every household." "The health room is really convenient, and it only costs a few cents to change medicine; the health room is nothing, and every village can do it; the production team has everything, and there is a health worker behind it." "Since there has been a health station, it is convenient for everyone in the village; the health station is really a treasure, and every household cannot do without it. The procedures for treating diseases are also simple. Just register for illness at the cooperative, and it only costs three cents a year, and the doctor will come to see the doctor." People's praise for the health care network, on the one hand, shows that this organizational form is welcomed by the masses; on the other hand, it also reflects the concern of the broad masses of peasants for health and happy life brought about by the new relations of production. The farmers in Taiyang Village composed a ballad saying: Everyone is engaged in production, every family pays attention to hygiene, every household has surplus grain, people and animals are free from diseases, and a happy life is guaranteed.
　　From the perspective of the development prospects of the rural health care network, we are only taking steps in the right direction now. The time is only two years, the achievements are not yet consolidated, the methods are not yet perfect, especially the development of work is still uneven, and some formalism and waste have begun to appear in some villages and townships. Therefore, on the existing basis, developing achievements, correcting shortcomings, and carrying forward this socialist cause is still an arduous task. We are determined to further mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, go all out, strive for the top, and make this cause leap forward again.

　　稷山县的农村卫生保健网
　　中共山西省稷山县委第一书记　仪耀文
    1956年春天，山西稷山县在全面实现了高级合作化的基础上，开始建立一套与生产相适应的卫生保健网，使全县卫生运动在宣传教育、组织领导以及医疗防预工作方面逐步走向经常化和制度化。
    农村卫生保健网，是采取国家力量和群众力量相结合的办法，在彻底改造原有的联合诊疗所和私人医生的基础上建立起来的。有县人民医院、防疫站和妇幼保健站，在业务上分别领导全县医疗、卫生、防疫、妇幼保健的业务和宣传教育工作。在五个集镇上，把原来的联合诊疗所和公立卫生所合并，成立四个综合性的地区医院和一个规模较大的卫生所，从业务上指导本区各联合保健站，进行医疗工作，并接受各保健站疑难病症的会诊。在十三个乡里，把原来的联合诊疗所和私人诊疗所合并改组为十三个联合保健站和十三个分站，分片包干进行医疗、预防和群众性的卫生保健工作。在二百二十九个自然村里，分别建立了二百二十个保健室，室内设有保健箱和保健员，分工负责全村的急救工伤、卫生防疫、新法接生、儿童保育等项工作。这样，就形成了一个国家与农业社相结合的卫生保健网。这样一个乡乡有医疗机构、社社有保健组织、有领导、有专责、有群众基础、医疗与保健统一、卫生与生产结合的卫生保健网，是发展农村群众性的卫生运动和医疗保健事业的强大力量。两年来的实践，已经充分显示了它的优越性。主要表现在：
    第一、它把卫生医疗事业纳入了社会主义的轨道，真正贯彻执行了预防为主的卫生工作方针，并且进一步从思想上改造着旧医务人员，树立了一套为人民服务的新的医疗作风。卫生保健网的经费来源：地区医院由国家负责，收部分保健费补助；保健站采取收保健费、医疗收入与农业社公益金补助三者相结合的办法。这样就从根本上解决了医生靠病人生活和贯彻预防为主方针之间的矛盾，使旧医务人员“病人越多收入越高”的想法，转变为“病人越少贡献越大”的想法，从经济上思想上改造了旧的医疗机构和医务人员。由于思想的改变，所以在工作方法上也建立了一套为生产服务为群众着想的制度。保健站根据农业社的分布情况，将全乡划为若干责任区，每区确定一个医生包干负责进行巡回医疗。如全县十三个保健站1956年就医数为十一万五千零三十二人次，其中属于田间和登门巡回医疗的就有七万三千七百四十六人次，占64％。为了解决医生找不到病人，病人找不到医生的问题，采取病人在社挂签报病，医生按签上门诊治的办法。为了控制传染病的蔓延，建立了疫病报告的制度，发现传染病，各责任医生即领导保健员一面报告一面进行隔离治疗，做到及时发现，及时报告，及时扑灭。同时，还建立了一种妇女经期和孕妇的挂签和统计制度，以便利于妇女经期休假和产前检查。勤俭办事已成为医务人员自觉遵守的原则。医生亲自动手整理房屋，修理桌凳已成为普遍现象。
    第二、它既是医疗保健事业的专业机构，又是群众性卫生保健工作的领导机构，成为开展群众爱国卫生运动的宣传者和组织者。社内无论召开什么会议，保健室都要插上一脚，农村中的各种活动，都是他们进行宣传工作的场合，他们抓住活人活事，运用标语、口号、漫画、戏剧等各种形式进行形象化的宣传。两年来全县经过保健网受到过卫生知识宣传教育的达十六万人次，并且还训练了农业社的保健员四百七十人、接生员八百八十三人、饲养员九百四十六人、托儿所的保姆二千一百三十六人，家庭主妇二万一千一百八十人。此外，在乡卫生保健委员会的统一领导下，由保健室进行指导，组织了青年除四害突击队、青年清扫队、青年儿童临时检查组，以及分片划定卫生区、责任区，订立卫生公约，定期总结交流经验，检查评比等活动，都证明保健网是保证搞好农村卫生保健工作，开展群众性卫生运动的极为有效的组织形式。
    第三、体现了卫生保健事业直接为生产服务的重大作用，推进了农业的增产运动。由于保健网和乡、社紧密结合，因而使卫生保健工作的内容和方法，也紧紧地围绕着农业生产去进行，发挥了直接为生产服务的作用。在保健网的组织和推动下，开展了环境卫生与积肥相结合、捕鼠灭雀与保粮相结合、饲养卫生与保畜相结合、家庭卫生与勤俭持家相结合、田间卫生与劳动保护相结合等“五结合”的群众性卫生运动就是很好的证明。从1957年9月以来，清扫、整厕、挖蛹、挖圈底等，共积肥三百五十万大车（每车一千五百斤），全县七十二万亩耕地每亩可增施肥料五大车。在牲畜的保健工作方面，除五个集镇设立了五个兽医站，由县农林局训练了二百二十多名兽医，分配在每个社做疾病防治工作之外，各乡的卫生保健站也都担负着畜瘟的防治和牲畜保健的指导工作。各保健站都能定期召开饲养员座谈会，总结与推广好的饲养经验。太阳村的“牲口喂养分类排队”法（按吃草快慢、牲口大小、牲口老幼和牲口种类等分类排队）、仁和社的饲养责任制以及“耕畜三定使用”法（定农活、定耕畜、定专人使用）等，都在不同范围内得到了推广。对牲畜棚圈、饲料、饲具、饮水等各个方面的卫生，普遍地引起了重视，因此，耕畜的死亡和发病率大大减少。在家庭卫生方面，各保健站训练了家庭主妇，发动大家订立了饮食守则，提出“节约、卫生、可口”的口号，开展了家庭卫生竞赛和儿童健康比赛，从而开始改变着人们的生活环境和生活方式。在劳动保护方面，各保健站都重视了对社员进行田间劳动的卫生教育；实行了“二带、四防、三按时”（带开水、带草帽，防暑、防伤、防火、防冻，按时上地、按时下地、按时吃饭）的制度；对社员进行了定期的健康检查，根据检查结果建议社和队按照健康程度和体质条件合理派活，并且已经在许多村的保健站里，将每个社员的健康状况建立了档案。村村办起了托儿所，全县普及了幼儿院；实行了妇女经期、孕期挂签制度，规定了产前产后的休假制度，普遍实行了新法接生，改变了产妇只喝稀米汤的旧习惯，目前全县正在进一步开展着计划生育的工作。
    现在群众已经体会到卫生保健网的好处。他们的结论是：“过去联诊所，人少利润高，群众有了病，医生请不到；成立保健站，事情完全变，医生走上门，全家保平安，不是新社会，梦都梦不见”。“过去医生架子大，车马酒席请不下，现在医生下了马，家家户户把病查”。“保健室，真方便，换药只花几分钱；保健室，不算啥，村村都能办到它；生产队，样样全，后面跟个保健员”。“自从有了保健站，全村大小都方便；保健站真是宝，家家户户离不了，治病手续又简便，只要到社挂病签，一年只花三角钱，医生就来把病看。”人们对保健网的称赞，一方面说明了这种组织形式是为群众所欢迎的；另一方面，也反映出新的生产关系使广大农民群众对身体健康和幸福生活的关切。太阳村的农民编了一首歌谣说：人人闹生产，家家讲卫生，户户有余粮，人畜无疾病，幸福生活有保证。
    农村卫生保健网，从事业的发展前途来说，现在我们仅仅是在向着正确的方面开步走，时间只有两年，成绩还是不巩固的，办法还是不完善的，特别是工作的发展还是不平衡的，而且有些村、乡已开始出现了形式主义和浪费现象。因此，在现有基础上，发展成绩，纠正缺点，使这一社会主义的事业发扬光大，还是一件艰巨的任务。我们决心更进一步地发动群众，依靠群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，使这个事业向前再跃进。
