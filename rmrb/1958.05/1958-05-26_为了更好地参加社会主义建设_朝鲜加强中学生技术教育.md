Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 25th - North Korea is providing basic technical education in industry and agriculture to middle school students, so that they can better participate in socialist construction in factories and agricultural cooperatives after graduation.

Most junior middle schools in North Korea are now systematically conducting basic technical education in industry and agriculture. More than two hundred senior middle schools in each province have added basic technical courses in industry, agriculture, and other fields.

The North Korean Ministry of Education and Culture recently decided to further strengthen basic technical education in junior and senior middle schools. It decided that in the upcoming new school year, all junior middle schools will make basic technical education in industry and agriculture a compulsory course. More than half of the senior middle schools across the country have prepared the necessary equipment for conducting basic industrial technical education.

In the years since the war, North Korea has seen a large number of junior and senior middle school graduates go to factories and rural areas every year. While participating in production practice, they continue to study economic and technical knowledge. Currently, more than six thousand junior and senior middle school graduates are studying in technical training classes in factories and enterprises, striving to become advanced skilled workers.

The more than seven thousand agricultural technology research groups that have been established in rural areas are playing a very good role. These research groups are organized with junior and senior middle school graduates as the backbone. A large number of young people have acquired special technical knowledge and have obtained qualifications as technicians or engineers recognized by the state. Many of them have even entered higher education institutions for further study.

    为了更好地参加社会主义建设
    朝鲜加强中学生技术教育
    新华社平壤25日电　朝鲜正在对中等学校学生进行工农业的基本技术教育，以便使他们在毕业后能够到工厂和农业合作社去更好地参加社会主义建设。
    朝鲜大多数的初级中学现在正在有系统地进行工业和农业方面的基本技术教育。各个道有二百多个高级中学已经增加了工农业以及其它方面的基本技术课程。
    朝鲜教育文化省最近决定在初级和高级中学中进一步加强基本技术教育。它决定要在即将到来的新学年中，让所有的初级中学都把工农业基本技术教育作为必修课程。全国有半数以上的高级中学已经准备了进行工业基本技术教育必须的设备。
    朝鲜在战后的年代里，每年有大批的初级和高级中学毕业生走向工厂和农村。他们在参加生产实践的同时，继续学习经济和技术方面的知识。现在有六千多名初级和高级中学的毕业生正在工厂企业中的技术训练班中学习，努力使自己成为高级的熟练工人。
    在农村中已经建立的七千多个农业技术研究小组正在发挥着它们很好的作用。这些研究小组都是以初级和高级中学毕业生为骨干组织起来的。有很大一批青年已经获得了特别的技术知识，并且获得了国家承认的技术员或工程师的资格。他们中间的许多人并且已经进入更高级的教育机构去深造。
