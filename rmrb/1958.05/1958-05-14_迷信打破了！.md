　　Superstition is Broken!
  　He Jiguang
    The responsible comrade of our unit reported: "Luoyang City has made great achievements in eliminating the four pests, and the four pests have been basically eliminated. Some people who originally doubted and thought that it was impossible to eliminate the four pests in Luoyang City have now had their superstitions broken!"

    "Superstition is broken!" These words impressed me very deeply. First of all, it made me happy because the people used actions and achievements to liberate some comrades from the shackles of superstition.

    Speaking of superstition, one always thinks of those who burn incense and worship Buddha. They are very pious to ghosts and gods, and believe that ghosts and gods have irresistible magic power that can control people's destiny. Although our comrades do not believe in ghosts and gods, they are fundamentally different in essence, but they always believe that difficulties have irresistible magic power that can control revolutionary work. This way of looking at problems is a subjective and one-sided method, a metaphysical method.

    Subjective and one-sided means only seeing one side and not the other. Only seeing difficulties and not seeing favorable conditions. Often, they exaggerate the difficulties and retreat in the face of them; they shrink the favorable conditions and lose confidence. They would rather believe that sparrows are tenacious than believe that the masses have solutions.

    Metaphysics means not being able to recognize that things are developing, and using an old perspective to look at new problems. They believe that sparrows have lived for thousands of years, and they are still alive in other countries now. How can they be eliminated? It's simply unbelievable.

    These people's ways of thinking have two common points: First, they underestimate the role of the people very much. They do not see that it is not the old dynasty that proposed to eliminate sparrows, but the Chinese people, organized under the leadership of the Party and full of the heroic spirit of "reversing the universe." Second, they stand on the position of the urging retreat faction. These people are accustomed to the surrounding conventions, do not like new things, are skeptical about the Great Leap Forward, and sigh at difficulties.

    Difficulty is contradiction. Since contradictions have factors that generate them, they must also contain factors that solve them. We are precisely going to seek the factors that solve contradictions and use them to overcome difficulties. If we determine that difficulties cannot be overcome, wouldn't we be determining that revolutionary work can only stagnate in the present and cannot develop forward? With this kind of thinking, how can we muster the courage to overcome numerous difficulties and build communism?

    As the saying goes, "If you put in enough effort, you can grind an iron rod into a needle." When a person is grinding an iron rod, there are always a few people who shake their heads and express disbelief, and even say a few sarcastic remarks. However, when a needle is placed in front of him, he is shocked and has to believe it. Developing our country's productive forces depends on the hard work of our people, bringing out the spirit of grinding an iron rod into a needle. Who will we rely on to catch up with England in fifteen years? Rely on people. Who will we rely on for the technological revolution? Rely on people. People's subjective initiative is showing itself today with vigor and a spirit of fearlessness.

    How to overcome "superstition"? There are many ways, but I think the best is to get in touch with reality. Through personal experience, many things that seemed impossible to do, how are they successfully done under the people's enthusiastic drive! This can greatly change one's rigid thinking, and the remaining superstition will definitely be broken.

### 迷信打破了！

　　迷信打破了！
  　何继光
    我们单位的负责同志报告说：“洛阳市除四害的成绩很大，四害已基本肃清。某些原来怀疑、认为在洛阳市不可能消灭四害的人，现在迷信打破了！”
    “迷信打破了！”这几个字对我的印象非常深刻，它首先使我感到高兴，因为人民群众用行动和成绩，使得某些同志从迷信的束缚中解放出来。
    一提起迷信，总会想到那些烧香拜佛的人，他们对鬼神非常虔诚，认为鬼神有不可抗拒的魔力，能摆布人的命运。虽然，我们那些同志并不相信鬼神，从本质上来说，也根本不同，但是他们总认为困难有不可抗拒的魔力，能摆布革命工作。这种看问题的方法，是主观片面的方法，是形而上学的方法。
    主观片面，就是只看见一面，看不见另一面，只看见困难，看不见有利条件。往往还把困难夸大，见难而退；把有利条件缩得很小，丧失信心。他们宁可相信麻雀之类是顽强的，而不相信群众是有办法的。
    形而上学，就是不能认识事物是发展的，用老眼光看新问题。他们认为，麻雀活了几千年，就是现在，在其他国家也还活着，怎么能够消灭呢，简直不能相信。
    这些人的思想方法，有两个共同点：其一，是对人民群众的作用估计得非常不足。看不见提出消灭麻雀的不是旧朝代，而是在党领导下组织起来的、充满着“旋乾转坤”的英雄气概的中国人民。其二，是站在促退派的立场上。这些人对周围的成规习以为常，对新生事物看不顺眼，对跃进发生怀疑，对困难唉声叹气。
    困难，就是矛盾。矛盾既然有产生的因素，也必然包含着解决的因素，我们正是要去寻求解决矛盾的因素，利用它克服困难。如果断定困难不可克服，岂不是就断定革命工作只能停滞在现在，不能向前发展了吗？有了这种思想，怎么能拿出勇气来克服重重困难建设共产主义呢？
    俗语说：“只要工夫深，铁杵磨成针”。当一个人杵磨铁的时候，总有少数人摇着头表示不相信，甚至还说几句不好听的风凉话，但是，当一根绣花针摆在他眼前时，他大吃一惊，不得不相信了。发展我国的生产力，就是要靠我国人民苦干，拿出铁杵磨成针的精神。十五年赶上英国靠谁？靠人。技术革命靠谁？靠人。人的主观能动作用，在今天表现得正是生气勃勃，充满着大无畏的精神。
    怎样克服“迷信”呢？办法虽很多，但我想最好的要算接触实际。通过亲身的体会，许多看起来办不到的事情，怎样在群众的热火朝天的干劲下，胜利地办到了！这就能使自己僵硬的思想起很大的变化，残余的迷信也就一定能打破。
