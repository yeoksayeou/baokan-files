　　Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom
　　Guo Moruo
    45 Sweet Pea
　　We and pea flowers are really alike,
　　Just that our colors are more diverse, and we have a bit of fragrance.
　　But the functions of peas are much stronger than ours,
　　Tender seedlings, tender pods, and seeds are all good food.
　　People, however, prefer to praise us,
　　Cultivating us in prominent places in parks.
　　We want to be transformed through production,
　　Requesting horticulturalists to send us down to the fields.
    46 Kerria Japonica
　　Our flowers are also all golden yellow,
　　But unlike winter jasmine, they resemble velvety tufts.
　　We cluster together, our vitality is very strong,
　　Breaking off tender branches and simply sticking them in the ground, and they can grow.
　　Our disease resistance is also extraordinary,
　　We don't get rust, we don't suffer from pests, we're not afraid of locusts.
　　The reason for this is worth exploring by scientists,
　　There's great potential for extracting some components.
      47 Lophatherum gracile
　　We Lophatherum gracile, the Japanese call us firefly grass,
　　Our flower shape resembles a firefly, our leaves resemble bamboo, both comparisons are good.
　　Fireflies glow at night, we glow in the early morning,
　　In the roadside grass, we are surrounded by dew.
　　If a lizard darts out from under our leaves,
　　People may hate it, but we like it.
　　Do you know? Lizards like to eat mosquitoes and flies,
　　Your help to you is actually not small.
    48 Cucumber Flower
　　We are ordinary cucumbers, our flowers are small and yellow;
　　Our flowers are dioecious, just like other melons.
　　But someone created a miracle that has long appeared in Beijing,
　　People often love to eat them, but don't use their brains much.
　　The suburban cooperative has a Sijiquing Farm,
　　Seedless cucumbers grow to be a foot and a half long.
　　Why are they seedless? Because they are virgin cucumbers,
　　The male flowers are pinched off, it is a man-made Saint Maria. (Note)
    (Note) Saint Maria is the mother of Jesus, who is said to have given birth to Jesus without being married.
      49 Short-Day Chrysanthemum
    Chrysanthemums that bloom in autumn bloom in spring,
    We are arranged to be short-day plants. (Note)
    Every day we are only allowed to be illuminated for ten hours,
    Following the autumn rules, we change our ecology.
    This miracle appears in Zhongshan Park,
    Please go to the Tang Flower Nursery to see it.
    China doesn't know how many Michurins there are,
    Who are still buried in the fields today.
    (Note) Horticulturists make chrysanthemums sprout early, giving them a certain amount of light each day, so they can bloom early in the spring. Experiments have shown that ten hours of light per day is better than eight hours.
      50 Fuchsia
    Our flower shape is like an inverted golden bell;
    There are many types, and the flower colors are white, blue, and red.
    Golden bells and religion once had a connection,
    Buddhism uses bells, Taoism uses bells, Christianity uses bells.
    There is no religion in the flower world,
    Our bell is just a kind of classical instrument.
    We are playing a symphony of world peace together,
    Listen, isn't there a sound of ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong?

### 百花齐放

　　百花齐放
　　郭沫若
    45　麝香豌豆
　　我们和豌豆花实在是相像，
　　只是花色多样，还有一点香。
　　但豌豆的功能远比我们强，
　　嫩苗、嫩荚、种籽都是好食粮。
　　人们却偏偏爱把我们夸奖，
　　栽培在公园里显著的地方。
　　我们想从生产中得到改造，
　　请求园艺家们把我们下放。
    46　棣棠花
　　我们的花朵同样是一片金黄，
　　但和迎春不同，是和绒团相仿。
　　我们丛聚在一处，生命力很强，
　　折取嫩枝，随便扞插，便能生长。
　　我们的抗病力量也不同寻常，
　　不生锈病，不犯虫害，不怕蝻蝗。
　　这里的原由值得科学家探究，
　　能提炼出什么成份，大有苗头。
      47　淡竹叶
　　我们淡竹叶，日本人叫作萤草，
　　花形像萤，叶子似竹，比得都好。
　　萤在晚间发光，我们是在清早，
　　在路旁的草丛中被露珠缭绕。
　　如果从叶子下梭出蜥蜴一条，
　　人们虽然憎恨，我们却是爱好。
　　你们知道吗？蜥蜴喜欢吃蚊蝇，
　　对你们的帮助倒实在是不小。
    48　黄瓜花
　　我们就是普通的黄瓜，花小而黄；
　　花分雌雄也和一般的瓜类一样。
　　但有人造奇迹早就出现在北京，
　　人们常常爱吃，却不大开动脑筋。
　　郊区的合作社有座四季青农场，
　　没有籽的黄瓜长得来一尺半长。
　　为什么没有籽？因为是处女黄瓜，
　　雄花掐掉了，是人造的圣玛丽亚。　（注）
    （注）圣玛丽亚是耶稣的母亲，据说她没有结婚便生下了耶稣。
      49　短日照菊
    秋天开的菊花在春天来开，
    我们是受了短日照的安排。（注）
    每日只让我们照光十小时，
    照着秋天的规律改移生态。
    这奇迹就出现在中山公园，
    请到唐花圃去就可以见面。
    中国不知道有多少米丘林，
    到今天还依然埋没在田间。
    （注）园艺家使菊花提前发芽，每天给以一定时间的光照，便能提前在春天开花。试验的结果，每日十小时光照比八小时好。
      50　吊金钟
    我们的花形就好像倒吊金钟；
    种类不少，花色有白，有蓝，有红。
    金钟和宗教曾经发生过联系，
    佛教用钟，道教用钟，耶教用钟。
    花世界中并没有任何宗教存在，
    我们的钟只是古典乐器的一种。
    我们在合奏世界和平的交响曲，
    听，不是有声音在丁东，丁东，丁东？
