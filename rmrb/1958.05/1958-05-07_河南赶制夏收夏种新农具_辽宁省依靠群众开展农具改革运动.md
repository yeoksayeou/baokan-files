    Henan Rushes to Produce New Farm Tools for Summer Harvest and Planting
    Liaoning Province Relies on the Masses to Carry Out Farm Tool Reform Movement

    (By our staff reporter) With a bumper wheat harvest in sight in Henan Province, the vast number of workers and peasants are working day and night to create, imitate, and improve various new-style farm tools suitable for summer harvest and planting in order to solve the difficulty of labor shortages during the summer harvest and planting season.

    At present, a total of twenty-eight counties and cities in Henan Province have successfully trial-produced various farm tools for summer harvesting and planting. Compared with the old farm tools used in the countryside in the past, these new farm tools can generally increase work efficiency by several to more than ten times. In terms of summer harvesting tools, Yiyang, Xiangcheng, Songxian, Changge, Xuchang, Luoning, Xinxiang and other counties have successfully trial-produced various types of human-powered harvesters. The human-pushed harvester successfully trial-produced in Yiyang County improves efficiency by fourteen to nineteen times compared with using old-fashioned farm tools. The human-powered harvester successfully trial-produced in Songxian County can harvest ten acres of wheat per day with one person operating it. The threshing machine successfully trial-produced in Zhengzhou City can thresh 20,000 catties of wheat or rice per day. After successfully reforming the power harvester, Xuchang City also successfully trial-produced a wheat-threshing winnower. In terms of summer planting tools, the twelve-tooth wooden drill successfully trial-produced in Xinyang County can plant seventy acres of autumn crops per drill per day. Xiping County not only successfully trial-produced a double-hopper drill that can sow seeds and fertilize at the same time, but also successfully trial-produced a four-legged close-planting drill, which can be operated by one person to sow thirty acres of land per day. Some of these machines have been preliminarily evaluated and are being vigorously promoted, while others are being evaluated and improved. These different types of agricultural machines will play a major role in striving for a bumper agricultural harvest this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th. Liaoning Province is mobilizing and relying on the masses to launch a farm tool reform and technical innovation movement of "everyone uses their brains, everyone has a treasure" in the form of organizing visits and appraisals, farm tool reform exhibitions, and technical innovation experience exchange meetings. As of April 26, statistics show that more than 1,000 kinds of water lifting, construction, field operation and other tools have been invented, created and improved throughout the province. The waterwheel automatic pumps created by farmers in Xinbin, Huanren and other places are simple in structure, cost only a few dozen yuan per unit, and have a water lift height of three to five meters. They are now being promoted throughout the province. The "cable car" created by farmers in Benxi County uses the drop of the river to automatically lift water, and each unit can irrigate 30 acres of land per day, at a cost of only 20 yuan. The promotion of these simple water lifting tools has overcome the difficulty of insufficient pumps after a large increase in paddy fields. The soybean spot planter created by farmers in Qingyuan and the soybean and sorghum mixed planter created by farmers in Xinbin, as well as the corn compactor and pitting machine created by farmers in Faku, Tieling and other places, can not only increase sowing efficiency by one to three times, but also ensure uniform plant spacing and depth. The wooden rail material truck created in Xinbin County can transport soil fifty times more efficiently than manual carrying. Counties have created, imitated, and promoted approximately 200,000 pieces of tampers, aerial postal vehicles, handcarts, etc., according to local conditions.

    Cadres and farmers in Qingyuan, Changtu, Suizhong, Lingyuan and other counties have collectively created methods such as high-temperature on-site burning of mixed fertilizer, rapid fermentation of peat with heating, and burning manure in earth kilns. After being promoted in various places, the amount of manure and fertilizer in the province increased by more than one-third in the fifty days before spring plowing, and the unit fertilizer application per hectare of land (only counting base fertilizer) increased from 100,000 catties to about 120,000 catties. This is of decisive significance for guaranteeing the realization of advanced production increase targets.

    河南赶制夏收夏种新农具
    辽宁省依靠群众开展农具改革运动
    本报讯　河南省小麦丰收在望，广大工农群众为了适应夏收夏种的需要，正夜以继日的创造、仿制和改制各种适宜夏收夏种的新式农具，以便解决夏收夏种中劳力不足的困难。
    目前河南省先后试制成功各种夏收夏种农具的共有二十八个县、市，这些新农具与过去农村使用的旧农具比较，一般都能提高工作效率几倍至十余倍。在夏收农具方面，宜阳、襄城、嵩县、长葛、许昌、洛宁、新乡等县，已试制成功各种类型的人力收割机。宜阳县试制成功的人推收割机，较使用旧式农具提高效率十四倍到十九倍。嵩县试制成功的人力收割机，一人操作每日可收小麦十亩。郑州市试制成功的脱谷机，每日能打麦或稻两万斤。许昌市继改制成功动力收割机之后，还试制成功打麦风车。在夏种农具方面，信阳县试制成功的十二齿木耧，每耧每天可以种秋七十亩。西平县不仅试制成功双斗耧，能播种同时也可施肥，而且试制成功四脚密植耧，每天一人操作可播种三十亩地。这些机器有的已经初步鉴定，正在大力推广，有的正在鉴定和改制，这些不同类型的农业机器，将在争取今年农业大丰收中发挥重大作用。
    新华社沈阳6日电　辽宁省以组织参观评比、农具改革展览、技术革新经验交流会等形式，发动和依靠群众展开“人人动脑、一人一宝”的农具改革和技术革新运动。到4月26日统计，全省发明创造和改良的提水、施工、田间作业等工具已达一千多种。新宾、桓仁等地农民创造的水轮自动抽水机，构造简单，每台造价只几十元，扬水高度达三公尺到五公尺，现在已经在全省推广。本溪县农民创造的“天车”，利用河流落差自动扬水，每台每天可浇地三十亩，造价仅二十元。推广这些简单的提水工具，克服了水田大量增加后抽水机不足的困难。清原农民创造的大豆点播机和新宾农民创造的大豆高粱混种机，法库、铁岭等地农民创造的玉米压按器、刨窝机等，不但可提高播种效率一倍到三倍，而且保证了株距和深度均匀。新宾县创造的木轨料车运土，比人工挑运提高效率五十倍以上。各县因地制宜地创造和仿制推广了打夯机、空中邮车、手推车等约二十万件。
    清原、昌图、绥中、凌源等县干部和农民集体创造高温就地烧制混合肥料、草炭加温快速醱酵、土窑烧粪等方法，在各地分别推广以后，使全省粪肥在春耕前五十天中就增加了三分之一以上，每公顷土地单位施肥量（只算基肥）由十万斤增加到十二万斤左右。这对保证实现先进增产指标有着决定意义。
