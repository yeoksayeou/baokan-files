    Jiuling Eighteen Gullies
    In Jiuling Eighteen Gullies, every gully is undergoing water conservancy construction.
    Barren slopes are being turned into rice paddies, poor gullies are becoming rich gullies.
    Come and see again in two years, the lamplight will be as bright as the stars!

    Little River Ballad
    The little river flows day and night, like jade liquid and nectar.
    Watching it flow away in vain, my heart really aches.
    Dry land is hard to harvest without irrigation, and rice paddies yield no grain without water.
    Let's quickly build dams and dig canals, and not let the water leave its homeland.

    Slogan
    Who is a true hero, who is a good man?
    Let's compete at the heroes' meeting.
    Our bones must be harder than steel, and we can even chew stones into eight pieces!

    九岭十八沟（外二首）
    井岩盾九岭十八沟，沟沟水利修。荒坡开稻田，穷沟变富沟。再过二年你来看，灯光灿烂比星稠！
    小河谣小河日夜哗哗淌，好似玉液和琼浆。眼看白白流失去，心中实在疼得慌。旱地不浇难丰收，稻田无水不打粮。快修堤坝开渠道，不让流水离故乡。
    口号谁真英雄谁好汉，群英会上比比看，骨头要比钢铁硬，石头也能咬八瓣！
