Everywhere Promote the General Line, Everyone Study the General Line
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 29th. Tianjin, the city that took the lead in launching a propaganda work competition, has organized a propaganda army of over 70,000 people, including factory and store employees, handicraft cooperative members, school teachers and students, street residents, and people from the arts, which has mobilized on all fronts to vigorously promote the general line of socialist construction to the broad masses of citizens. According to statistics, over 1.5 million people in the city have now been educated on the general line.
    Many workers from 100 factories in various districts of the city, after hearing the report of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, immediately went to the streets to promote it to the citizens. Workers from the Tianjin Shoe Factory, led by the Party Secretary, performed cross-talk and other programs they had written themselves to promote the general line to the citizens. Propaganda teams from cultural centers and street residents in various districts have also been active in the streets in recent days. More than 110 residential areas in Nankai District organized a propaganda army of more than 2,400 people, using lively methods such as chorus, clapper talk, street plays, propaganda vehicles, and radio stations to promote the general line to more than 46,000 citizens in one day. Four propaganda teams organized by the Hedong District Cultural Center rushed to write cross-talk, Shandong fast stories, single-stringer and other programs to promote the general line. Cadres from the Hexi District Cultural Center also rushed to create "General Line Newsreels" and "General Line Ditties," duets, and clapper talk, and organized eight propaganda teams to promote it in the streets, which was very popular among citizens.
    The literary and art army composed of various professional literary and art groups also mobilized to the streets today to promote. Actors from the Tianjin Art Theater Song and Dance Troupe sang the newly written song "Ode to the Party" on the streets on a propaganda vehicle. Wu Yiwen, an actor from the Tianjin Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe, also wrote Bangzi Opera and clapper talk to promote the general line, and performed on the streets today.
    Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 29th. A massive movement to study and promote the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has begun in Chongqing today.
    The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee has decided to organize a propaganda team of 100,000 people, and 1.5 million people should hear the propaganda about the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress within a week. Many units have held discussion meetings, and responsible cadres such as Party Secretaries at all levels, Bureau Chiefs of government departments, District Heads, factory directors, and school principals have made arrangements in their respective units and have begun to explain the content of the "Eighth National Congress" resolutions and the general line of socialist construction to the masses.
    Because the people of the city are extremely concerned about the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the circulation of Chongqing newspapers has greatly increased in recent days. Many agencies and factories have achieved one copy of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress for each person. The vast majority of factories and schools throughout the city have automatically organized the study of documents before receiving the notice from the higher-level Party committee. The Chongqing Coal Mine Administration stopped working on the afternoons of the 27th and 28th to conduct studies. The Municipal Grain Bureau studied documents all day today. The Party branch of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee's organ also convened a special branch meeting to mobilize all Party members to earnestly study the various documents of this meeting.
    Industrial and mining enterprises such as Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory and Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have already begun to study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.
    District-level agencies and residents have also begun to study the documents. More than 1,200 reading groups in the residents' sections of the city center have begun to organize residents to study the documents. Forty-nine instructors organized by the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee of the Central District will go deep into the residents' sections to widely explain the content of the documents to the residents.
