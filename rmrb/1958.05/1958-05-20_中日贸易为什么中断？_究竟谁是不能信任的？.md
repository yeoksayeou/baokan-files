　　Why Did Sino-Japanese Trade Stop?
    Who Exactly is Untrustworthy?
　　Commentator of this newspaper
    "The fact that Communist China has now stopped trade talks shows that it is a completely untrustworthy country." This is another slander against China made by Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi in his statement to reporters on the 13th of this month. Nobusuke Kishi is trying to shift the blame and put the responsibility for destroying Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade on China. His purpose is obviously to deceive the Japanese people and win votes. Nobusuke Kishi has always been hostile to the Chinese people, has always hindered and sabotaged Sino-Japanese trade, and finally colluded with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to openly tear up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. But after doing all this, he still wants to steal the attractive banner of "promoting Sino-Japanese trade," and even instructs the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to use upside-down fallacies to whitewash him, dressing him up as a character who is seemingly "enthusiastic" about Sino-Japanese trade, in order to fish in troubled waters, which cannot but be said to be extremely despicable and shameless. But the facts cannot be distorted, and the Chinese people will not allow Nobusuke Kishi to wantonly slander us, so it is necessary for us to refute him again based on a series of facts.

    The fact is that, although the state of war between China and Japan has not ended, the Chinese people, in the spirit of friendship with the Japanese people, have always made active efforts to promote Sino-Japanese trade. The Chinese government has always adopted a supportive and assisting attitude towards the development of Sino-Japanese trade. On the contrary, Nobusuke Kishi, since he served as Foreign Minister in the Ishibashi Cabinet, has publicly sung the tune of "not being in a hurry to expand trade" on the issue of Sino-Japanese trade. After he took the seat of Prime Minister, he more blatantly adopted a hostile attitude towards China. At the beginning of last year, the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was about to expire. At that time, three Japanese groups agreed with our country's International Trade Promotion Committee to come to Beijing to negotiate the conclusion of a new trade agreement. However, due to Nobusuke Kishi's obstruction of the mutual establishment of private commercial representative offices due to the fingerprint issue, the Japanese representatives could not make the trip. The agreed negotiations between the two parties were forced to be shelved. On the one hand, Nobusuke Kishi prevented the Japanese representatives from coming to our country to negotiate a new trade agreement. On the other hand, in June last year, he ran to Taiwan and the United States to make a lot of noise, viciously attacking and slandering our country, and even publicly issued subversive remarks supporting Chiang Kai-shek's "recovery of the mainland." At the same time, he expressed "regret" for the British opposition to the United States' control and the adoption of measures to relax the "embargo" on China, and said that "Japan will not do such a thing that damages the unity of allied countries." It is precisely because of Nobusuke Kishi's hostility towards China and his attitude of hindering and sabotaging Sino-Japanese trade that after the expiration of the Third Agreement in May last year, the private trade agreement relationship between the people of China and Japan, which had lasted for five years, was destroyed, and a state of no agreement began to appear. This is the first fact of Nobusuke Kishi's "enthusiasm" for "promoting" Sino-Japanese trade.

    Nobusuke Kishi's actions of hostility towards our country and hindering and sabotaging Sino-Japanese trade have aroused condemnation and opposition from the vast number of Japanese people who demand Sino-Japanese friendship and the development of trade between the two countries. After Nobusuke Kishi reorganized his cabinet in July last year, even the Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" strongly criticized him, saying: "The government's trade policy towards China is not as active as the Ishibashi Cabinet; similarly, the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet is not as active after Prime Minister Kishi's visit to the United States as it was before the visit. We cannot understand why Japan, which is based in Asia and closest to China, is more timid on the issue of trade with China than Britain and West Germany?" It was precisely under this pressure from the Japanese people, including some Japanese bourgeois public opinion, that Nobusuke Kishi dragged on until September last year before he had to superficially agree to the representatives of the three Japanese groups coming to our country to negotiate the Fourth Trade Agreement. However, Nobusuke Kishi also proposed an absurd restriction that the number of Chinese commercial representative offices in Japan should be limited to five people. This actually made it impossible to establish a commercial representative office. The Chinese side insisted that the number of representatives should be determined according to work needs. Even all the representatives who came to negotiate from the Japanese side, including the representatives of the Liberal Democratic Party, believed that this was reasonable and agreed. However, due to Nobusuke Kishi's unreasonable restrictions, they had to return to their country for instructions. Therefore, although China had made great concessions on many issues, and both parties had reached an agreement on the draft agreement and memorandum, the agreement still could not be signed, and the negotiations were still interrupted. This is the second fact of Nobusuke Kishi's "enthusiasm" for "promoting" Sino-Japanese trade. And now, Nobusuke Kishi actually instructed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to say that he had taken "realistic and reasonable measures within the scope of promoting trade" for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement! This is really shameless!

    Did the Chinese people not know that Nobusuke Kishi adopted a blatant attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people? We knew it. On July 25 last year, our Premier Zhou Enlai issued a statement, solemnly condemning Nobusuke Kishi's actions of hostility towards China and provoking relations between Asian countries and China. However, for the sake of friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, the Chinese people still did not stop trading with Japan during this period and the period of agreement blank, but instead adopted a positive attitude. Isn't this an ironclad fact?

    As the Japanese economic crisis became more and more serious, the Japanese people's call for expanding Sino-Japanese trade became higher and higher, and even developed into a national movement. Moreover, Nobusuke Kishi was also trying to put on a posture of being willing to solve the Sino-Japanese trade problem before dissolving the Diet and holding a general election in order to increase his political capital. Therefore, in February this year, he finally agreed that the three Japanese groups would come to Beijing to sign the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement expressly stated in several places that "both parties shall obtain the consent of their respective governments." Nobusuke Kishi certainly would not have failed to see this. Since he agreed that the three Japanese groups would come to sign, according to common sense, the matter of "consent" should not be a problem. However, after the agreement was signed, Nobusuke Kishi said on the same day at the Budget Committee of the House of Councillors that the provision in this agreement that the commercial representative office has the right to fly the national flag is "inappropriate" and expressed that it is difficult to recognize this agreement. Isn't this going back on his word? Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to undermine the Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was already obvious, but the Chinese side still adopted a tolerant attitude and calmly waited for the official reply from the three Japanese groups for nearly a month.

    Later, Nobusuke Kishi colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In his reply to the three Japanese groups on April 9, he actually adopted a double-dealing approach. On the one hand, he hypocritically put forward the mantra of "support" and "assistance." On the other hand, he openly denied the right to fly the national flag, which was clearly stipulated in the memorandum. At the same time, he fabricated the so-called "privileged status" to overthrow the provisions on the safety guarantees and work convenience of the commercial representative offices and their personnel of both parties, which were made in the agreement and memorandum based on the principle of equality, thereby completely destroying the agreement. This is the third fact of Nobusuke Kishi's "enthusiasm" for "promoting" Sino-Japanese trade. And now, Nobusuke Kishi actually instructed the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to say that the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet "solved" the fingerprint problem and the problem of setting up private commercial representative offices that the Hatoyama Cabinet and the Ishibashi Cabinet had failed to solve. He even wanted to use this to deceive the Japanese people and "show off his ugliness"! This is really shameless!

    Nobusuke Kishi wanted to "solve" the outstanding issue of Sino-Japanese trade according to his wishful thinking before dissolving the Diet and holding a general election in order to increase his election capital. The Chinese people are certainly very clear about his political plan. But the Chinese people did not refuse to sign the Fourth Trade Agreement with the three Japanese groups because of this. Even after Nobusuke Kishi colluded with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and adopted a double-dealing approach to undermine the trade agreement, although the Chinese people raised serious accusations, they did not interrupt trade relations with Japan. The visiting delegations of China National Metals & Minerals Import & Export Corporation and China National Minerals Corporation also remained in Japan to continue negotiations. Moreover, our country not only agreed to continue and extend the Japanese Commodity Exhibition in Wuhan for three days, but also allowed the Japanese side to fly the Japanese flag. The Chinese people have taken a positive attitude to develop Sino-Japanese trade in order to strengthen the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, and have even done their best. Isn't this an ironclad fact?

    However, Nobusuke Kishi mistakenly thought that the Chinese people could be deceived. After openly undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, wantonly reversing black and white, maliciously slandering our country, and reaching a secret and sinister tacit understanding with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique, he even took a step further and openly condoned thugs to insult our national flag in Nagasaki. This incident proves that there is no guarantee that the various provisions in the trade agreement, including the right to fly the national flag, will be implemented at all. The prerequisite for the people of China and Japan to conduct trade on the basis of equality, mutual benefit and friendship has been completely destroyed by Nobusuke Kishi. Moreover, this provocation has brought the Chinese people to the point of being unbearable. It was under these circumstances that the Chinese people had to resolutely take measures to stop all trade activities with Japan. This is precisely the attitude and right taken by an independent and sovereign country to safeguard national dignity.

    The above-mentioned ironclad facts irrefutably prove that Nobusuke Kishi is a consistent enemy of China, a consistent saboteur of Sino-Japanese trade, a double-dealer, and a perfidious sinner who cannot be trusted at all. In the face of such facts, we want to ask: Who exactly is untrustworthy? Who exactly is "untrustworthy"? If Nobusuke Kishi still wants to treat the Chinese people, who have driven away all imperialists, with the eyes of a senior official of the puppet Manchuria and the Minister of Commerce and Industry and Vice Minister of Military Supplies of the Tojo Cabinet, then he will be smashed to pieces. If Nobusuke Kishi thinks that the Chinese people must trade with Japan according to his ideas, that is a pipe dream.

    Currently, there are eighty-one countries and regions that have trade relations with China besides Japan. China's trade with these countries and regions is developing day by day. Recently, the transaction volume of the Guangzhou Export Commodities Fair reached 64 million pounds in one month. This is precisely the result of China's adherence to the principle of equality and mutual benefit and adherence to international credibility. The former war criminal Nobusuke Kishi and his small group of reactionaries will be futile in their attempt to slander China and undermine China's international credibility.

    If Nobusuke Kishi continues to adhere to the policy of hostility towards the Chinese people and continues to play double-dealing deceptive tricks, he will have no other result than to further expose his own meanness and shamelessness.

　　中日贸易为什么中断？
    究竟谁是不能信任的？
　　本报评论员
    “共产党中国到现在来停止贸易商谈这样的事情显示出：它是完全不能信任的国家。”这是日本首相岸信介本月13日对新闻记者发表谈话时对中国进行的再一次污蔑。岸信介妄图反咬一口，把破坏中日关系和中日贸易的责任推到中国身上，其目的显然是为了欺骗日本人民，捞取选票。岸信介一贯敌视中国人民，一贯阻挠和破坏中日贸易，并且最后终于勾结美国和蒋介石集团，公然撕毁了第四次中日贸易协定。可是他在干了这一切之后，却依然想窃取“促进中日贸易”这面吸引人的旗子，甚至指使日本外务省用颠倒黑白的谬论来为他涂脂抹粉，把他打扮成一个仿佛是“热心”于中日贸易的角色，以图混水摸鱼，就不能不说是卑劣无耻之极了。但事实不容歪曲，中国人民更不能听任岸信介肆意污蔑，因此我们有必要根据一系列的事实，再加以驳斥。
    事实是，尽管中日两国战争状态尚未结束，中国人民本着同日本人民友好的精神，一直为促进中日贸易作了积极的努力。中国政府对发展中日贸易也历来是采取了支持和协助的态度。相反的，岸信介从他担任石桥内阁外务相的时候起，在有关中日贸易问题上，就公开唱出“并不急于扩大贸易”之类的调子。等到他坐上首相席位之后，就更加露骨地采取了敌视中国的态度。去年初，第三次中日贸易协定临近期满，当时日本三团体曾同我国国际贸易促进委员会约定前来北京商谈缔结新的贸易协定。但是由于岸信介以指纹问题，阻挠互设民间商务代表机构，使日方代表不能成行。使双方约定的商谈被迫搁浅，岸信介一方面阻挠日方代表前来我国商谈新的贸易协定，一方面在去年6月，跑到台湾和美国去大放厥词，对我国进行了恶毒的攻击和中伤，甚至公然发表支持蒋介石“收复大陆”之类的颠覆性质的言论，同时对当时英国反对美国的控制、采取放宽对华“禁运”措施表示“遗憾”，并且说“英国这种损害盟邦协力一致的作法是日本所不会作的”。正是由于岸信介敌视中国、对中日贸易采取了横加阻挠的态度，所以去年5月第三次协定期满之后，中日两国人民间继续了五年之久的民间贸易协定关系，遭到了破坏，开始出现了无协定的空白状态。这就是岸信介“热心”“促进”中日贸易的第一个事实。
    岸信介这种敌视我国，阻挠和破坏中日贸易的行动，引起了要求中日友好，要求发展两国贸易的日本广大人民的谴责和反对。去年7月岸信介改组内阁以后，连日本资产阶级报纸“读卖新闻”也曾强烈指责说：“政府对中国的贸易政策，岸信介内阁不如石桥内阁积极；同样的岸信介内阁，在岸首相访美之后又不如访美之前积极。我们不能理解，立国于亚洲，而且最靠近中国的日本，为什么在对中国的贸易问题上却比英国、西德更加胆小？”正是在日本人民，包括一部分日本资产阶级舆论在内的这种压力之下，岸信介拖到去年9月，才不得不表面同意日本三团体代表前来我国商谈第四次贸易协定问题。但是岸信介又提出了中国在日本设立民间商务代表机构的人数只能限于五人的荒谬限制。这实际上是使商务代表机构的设置无法实现。中国方面坚持代表机构人数应根据工作需要决定的主张，连日方前来谈判的全体代表、包括自由民主党的代表在内，也认为是合情合理的，表示同意。但由于岸信介的无理限制，他们不能不回国请示，因此，虽然由于中国在很多问题上作了很大让步，双方已就协定草案和备忘录达成一致协议，但是协定还是不能签字，谈判仍告中断。这就是岸信介“热心”“促进”中日贸易的第二个事实。而现在，岸信介却居然指使日本外务省，说什么他对第四次中日贸易协定“也尽可能地在促进贸易的范围内采取了现实而合理的措施”哩！这真是恬不知耻！
    岸信介采取露骨的敌视中国人民的态度，中国人民不知道吗？知道的。去年7月25日我国周恩来总理就曾发表谈话，严正地指责了岸信介敌视中国、挑拨亚洲国家同中国关系的行为。但是中国人民为了中日两国人民的友好，就是在这种情况下和协定的空白期间内，仍没有停止同日本进行贸易往来，相反地而是采取积极的态度，这难道不是铁的事实吗？
    由于日本经济危机越来越严重，日本人民要求扩大中日贸易的呼声也越来越高，甚至发展成了国民运动，而且岸信介也在力图解散国会、举行大选之前，摆出愿意解决中日贸易问题的姿态，以增加他的政治资本，因此，在今年2月他终于同意日本三团体前来北京签订第四次中日贸易协定。第四次中日贸易协定中有数处明文写道，“双方各自取得本国政府的同意”字样，岸信介当然不会没有看到，既然答应日本三团体前来签字，按常理说，“同意”之事就应该不成为问题了。可是协定签字之后，岸信介当天又在参议院预算委员会上说，在这个协定中规定商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗，是“不适当”的，并且表示难于承认这个协定。这难道还不是出乎尔反乎尔吗？岸信介破坏中日贸易协定的阴谋已经昭然若揭，但是中国方面仍然采取了容忍态度，冷静地等待日本三团体的正式答复至将近一个月之久。
    以后，岸信介又同蒋介石集团勾勾搭搭，在4月9日给日本三团体的答复中，竟采取两面三刀的手法，一方面虚伪地提出“支持”和“协助”的口头禅，一方面却公然否认了备忘录里明文规定的悬挂国旗的权利，同时凭空捏造出所谓“特权地位”的说法，以推翻双方根据对等原则在协定和备忘录里所作的有关双方商务代表机构及其人员的安全保证和工作方便的规定，从而完全破坏了协定。这就是岸信介“热心”“促进”中日贸易的第三个事实。而现在，岸信介却居然指使日本外务省，说什么岸信介内阁“解决了”鸠山内阁和石桥内阁都未能解决的指纹问题和设置民间商务代表机构问题，竟想以此来欺骗日本人民为自己“丑表功”哩！这真是恬不知耻！
    岸信介想在解散国会、举行大选之前，按着他的如意算盘，“解决”中日贸易问题的悬案，以增加他的竞选资本，他的这种政治打算，中国人民当然十分清楚，知道的。但是中国人民并没有因此而拒绝同日本三团体签订第四次贸易协定。甚至在岸信介勾结美国和蒋介石集团，采取两面三刀的手法，破坏了贸易协定之后，中国人民虽然提出了严重的指责，但是也没有中断同日本的贸易关系，中国五金进口公司和中国矿产公司的访日代表团也还留在日本继续进行商谈。并且，我国不但同意在武汉的日本商品展览会继续举行和延期三天，而且还容许日方悬挂日本国旗。中国人民为了加强中日人民的友好，采取积极态度发展中日贸易，甚至作到了仁至义尽，这难道不是铁的事实吗？
    可是岸信介却错以为中国人民可欺，在公然破坏了中日贸易第四次协定，对我国尽情颠倒黑白，恶意中伤，并和台湾蒋介石集团达成鬼祟阴险的默契之后，竟得寸进尺，公然纵容暴徒在长崎侮辱了我国国旗。这一事件证明，贸易协定中包括悬挂国旗权利在内的各项规定，丝毫没有实施的保证，中日两国人民在平等互利和友好的基础上进行贸易的前提条件，已被岸信介破坏无余。而且这种挑衅，使中国人民到了忍无可忍的地步。正是在这种情况下，中国人民不得不断然采取了停止一切对日贸易活动的措施。这正是一个独立自主国家为了维护国家尊严所采取的态度和权利。
    上述的铁的事实无可辩驳地证明，岸信介是一贯敌视中国一贯破坏中日贸易玩弄两面三刀手法，根本不能信任的出尔反尔的罪人。在这样的事实的面前，我们要问：究竟是谁不讲信义？究竟谁是“不能信任的”？如果岸信介还想拿他当年担任伪满洲国高级官吏和东条内阁商工大臣、军需次官的眼光，对待赶走了一切帝国主义的中国人民，那他就要碰得头破血流。如果岸信介以为中国人民非按着他的想法同日本进行贸易不可，那是痴人梦呓。
    目前同中国有贸易关系的，除了日本之外，还有八十一个国家和地区。中国同这些国家和地区的贸易正在一天天发展。最近广州出口交易会，一个月之间成交额就达到六千四百万英镑。这正是由于中国坚持平等互利的原则，遵守国际信义的结果。前战犯岸信介及其一小撮反动派，妄想污蔑中国，破坏中国的国际信义，将是徒劳的。
    岸信介如果继续坚持敌视中国人民的政策，而又继续玩弄两面三刀的欺骗手段，那除了更加暴露自己的卑劣无耻以外，不会有其他结果的。
