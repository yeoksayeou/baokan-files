    Zhahe Plain Coal Mine Begins Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 25th: Large-scale mine construction projects have begun in the new Zhahe Plain coalfield in Huaibei, Anhui Province. This year, eleven pairs of mine shafts will be built here, with a designed annual output of nearly six million tons, equivalent to the designed production capacity of the Huainan Coal Mine, which has been under construction for more than fifty years.
    According to the national plan, more than thirty pairs of mine shafts will be built in the entire Zhahe Plain coalfield during the Second Five-Year Plan, with a total designed annual output of more than 12 million tons. The mines that are now under construction will be put into production successively before 1960.

    据新华社合肥25日电  安徽省淮北闸河平原新煤田上大规模的矿井建设工程已经开始。今年，这里将兴建十一对矿井，设计年产量近六百万吨，相当于建设了五十多年之久的淮南煤矿的设计生产能力。
    按照国家的计划，整个闸河平原煤田上，在第二个五年计划期间将建设三十多对矿井，总设计年产量为一千二百万吨以上。今开工的矿井都将在1960年以前陆续投入生产。
