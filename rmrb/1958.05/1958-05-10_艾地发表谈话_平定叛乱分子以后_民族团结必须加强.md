Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 9th: The Hungarian newspaper "People's Freedom" published on the 8th, in a prominent position, a statement made by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, to the newspaper's reporter on issues related to national unity in Indonesia.
    Aidit said that although the government and the army still need to make great efforts, it is only a matter of time before the rebels are suppressed. After the rebels are suppressed, national unity in Indonesia must naturally be strengthened.
    Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party has been working to cooperate with nationalist parties and other religious parties. Except for the Masyumi Party and the Indonesian Socialist Party, the Indonesian Communist Party now acts in unison with other parties on some major issues.
    Regarding the United States' support for the rebels, Aidit said that the United States has supported the rebels since the preparatory stage. Prime Minister Djuanda clearly stated in his statement on April 30 that the government has sufficient evidence to prove that the United States has helped the rebels.
    Aidit also said that the Indonesian Communist Party is now an important force in defending and consolidating national independence. The Indonesian Communist Party has one million members and has received 8.2 million votes. After this general election, the Indonesian Communist Party still hopes to organize a national coalition government, because only such a government can better unite the forces of all aspects of the country.

    艾地发表谈话
    平定叛乱分子以后  民族团结必须加强
    新华社布达佩斯9日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”8日以显著地位刊登了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地就有关印度尼西亚的民族团结等问题向这家报纸记者发表的谈话。
    艾地说，虽然政府和军队还需要作很大的努力，但是叛乱分子被镇压下去已经仅仅是时间问题了。叛乱分子被镇压下去后，印度尼西亚的民族团结自然必须加强。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚共产党一直努力同民族主义政党和其他宗教政党取得合作。除马斯友美党和印度尼西亚社会党外，印度尼西亚共产党现在同其他党派在一些重大问题上，都是一致行动的。
    关于美国支持叛乱分子的问题，艾地说，美国从准备阶段起就支持叛乱分子。朱安达总理在4月30日的声明中清楚地说过，政府掌握了足够的证据，来证明美国帮助了叛乱分子。
    艾地还说，现在印度尼西亚共产党在保卫和巩固民族独立方面是一个重要的力量，印度尼西亚共产党已拥有一百万党员，并且曾获得过八百二十万选票。这次大选以后，印度尼西亚共产党仍然希望组织一个民族联合政府。因为只有这样一个政府才能更好地团结全国的各方面的力量。
