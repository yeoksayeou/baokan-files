Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th. The entire workforce of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's Youth Blast Furnace celebrated the successful conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China today with practical actions of setting a new national record for the highest blast furnace utilization coefficient.

After seeing the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in the newspaper today, the entire workforce of this blast furnace was greatly encouraged and immediately put forward the slogan "Surpass Benxi Steel, Catch up with Shijingshan Steel, Celebrate the Successful Closing of the Second Session of the 'Eighth National Congress'!" While ensuring the smooth operation of the furnace, they continued to increase the smelting intensity and coke load. Therefore, they created a new record of 0.444 for the utilization coefficient. This achievement is 0.044 lower than the new national record of 0.488 for the blast furnace utilization coefficient created by the Youth Blast Furnace of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant on May 20. The quality of pig iron reached 100%.

This new record is the thirteenth new record created by this blast furnace since the beginning of this year.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 25th. After the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China reached the Yunnan Dyeing and Bleaching Factory, the factory's radio station immediately broadcast it repeatedly to the workshop workers. Dai Renli, a 23-year-old youth printing worker, recently improved the dyeing work of multi-color printed fabrics, saving the factory 200,000 yuan a year. Today, he excitedly stated that he would definitely follow the Party's instructions to break superstitions and boldly create, and innovate more technologies this year. Tomorrow is the factory's holiday, and he said that he would use the holiday to carry out technological innovation experiments to reduce dyes in single-color printed fabrics. Cai Jizheng, an old worker in the electrical engineering team, had already been brewing the trial production of automatic cloth stacking machines, automatic cloth cutting machines, and other tools to replace the current manual operations, and had quietly drawn sketches, but he had never talked about this to others. Today, after seeing the news of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, he was extremely excited and immediately reported his plans to the Party General Branch.

When the good news reached the Kunming Smelter, Zhang Shizhong, a young advanced worker in the Second Workshop, was conducting experiments to improve the quality of electrolytic zinc. The Party's proposal of technological revolution and its call for daring to act encouraged their enthusiasm. They replaced silver with copper oxide in the electrolytic zinc solution, and the quality was indeed improved and the cost was reduced. This successful experiment will be promoted throughout the workshop.

    庆祝“八大”二次会议闭幕
    太原钢铁厂再创高炉利用系数新纪录
    云南漂染厂等职工决心大胆创造发明
    新华社太原25日电　太原钢铁厂青年高炉全体职工，今天以再创全国高炉利用系数最高新纪录的实际行动，庆祝中共第八届全国代表大会第二次会议胜利闭幕。
    这个高炉的全体职工今天从报纸上看到中共八大二次会议闭幕的消息以后，受到极大的鼓舞，立即提出了“超过本钢，赶上石钢，庆祝‘八大’二次会议胜利闭幕”的口号。他们在保证炉况顺行的情况下，继续提高了冶炼强度和焦炭负荷。因此创造了利用系数零点四四四的新纪录。这一成就比石景山钢铁厂青年高炉5月20日创造的全国高炉利用系数零点四八八的新纪录，降低了零点零四四。生铁质量达到百分之百。
    这次新纪录是这个高炉今年以来创造的第十三次新纪录。
    新华社昆明25日电　中共八大第二次会议闭幕的消息传到云南漂染厂后，厂中的广播台立即反复向车间工人广播。二十三岁的青年印花工人戴仁礼，不久前因改进了多套色印花布的染色工作，使全厂一年内可节约二十万元。今天，他兴高采烈地表示，一定要遵照党破除迷信、大胆创造的指示，在今年内革新更多的技术。明天是工厂休假的日子，他表示要利用假日进行单套色印花布减少染料的技术革新试验。电工组老工人蔡继正早已酝酿试制自动堆布器、自动剪布机等工具，以机器代替目前人工操作，并已悄悄绘制草图，但是他从来没有把这件事向别人谈过。今天，他看到党的八大二次会议的消息后，无限兴奋，立即把自己的打算向党总支作了汇报。
    当喜讯传到昆明冶炼厂的时候，二车间青年先进者张世忠正在进行提高电解锌质量的试验，党提出技术革命、号召敢作敢为的消息鼓舞了他们的热情。他们以氧化铜代替银子放入电解锌溶液中，质量果然提高，成本也降低了，这个成功的试验，将在全车间推广。
