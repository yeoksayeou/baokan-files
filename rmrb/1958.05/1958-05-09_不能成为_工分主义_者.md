    Cannot Become a "Work Point Supremacist"
    Similar to the situation of Yu Zhiming, I have only been working in the countryside for three months, and I was also determined to work hard and train myself. However, in my mind, I thought that more work points meant better labor, and I used work points to replace being both red and expert. In my personal plan, I even set an astonishing work point target: to reach 2,000 work points for the whole year, and strive for 3,000 work points. Under the guidance of this thought, I only chose heavy work with more work points, avoided light work with fewer work points, and declined social work and other work that did not earn work points. Others only carried two pieces of earth, but I carried six, earning a dozen work points every day. Therefore, my comrades criticized me as a work point supremacist. Later, with the help of my comrades, I realized that this approach was wrong.
    Why is work point supremacy wrong?
    First, the purpose of working in the countryside is to transform our thinking, not for work points. For us, labor is only a method and means of transforming our thinking, not an end in itself. The most important thing is to become cadres who are both red and expert through labor.
    Second, work point supremacy will inevitably lead to the consequence of being divorced from the masses. Because people with this kind of thinking are not thinking about how to better integrate with the masses and share their joys and sorrows. They also do not understand what the masses need and what they dislike. If they are unwilling to do things that the masses urgently need the cadres working in the countryside to do, they will become divorced from the masses. If they are divorced from the masses, they will not be able to receive the masses' test and supervision of us. In this way, how can our thinking improve? How can we become red?
    Third, work point supremacy is not in line with the spirit of the Party's policy of sending cadres to work in the countryside. Sending cadres to work in the countryside is for us to be both red and expert. Being red means being loyal to the proletariat, loyal to the cause of communism, and firmly determined to serve the people. Everyone knows that serving the people cannot demand conditions and rewards. As long as it is beneficial to the people and needed by the masses, we should do it unswervingly. Therefore, the work point supremacy of refusing to do social work and only pursuing work points is obviously contrary to this spirit.
    Why does this work point supremacy arise? I think there are ideological problems and also cognitive problems. We intellectuals from petty-bourgeois families have a tendency to go to extremes and always understand the Party's policies in a one-sided way. The Party calls on us to work in the countryside, and we think that only labor is important, so we bury ourselves in labor and ignore everything else. We show indifference and lack of enthusiasm in the face of current major political events. This is obviously not a good phenomenon. Working in the countryside is originally a great ideological transformation measure. As cadres participating in this great movement, they should constantly overcome their non-proletarian thinking. However, work point supremacists overcome their individualism with individualism. How can this be transformed well? Because what they think of first is not the collective, but "I." They put "I" in the first place, starting from "I." They are willing to do what is beneficial to "me," but unwilling to do what is beneficial to the collective but not to "me." Isn't this individualism! Therefore, working in the countryside is a process of labor, but also a process of intense ideological struggle. In this struggle, we must not relax our own transformation at every moment.

### 不能成为“工分主义”者

    不能成为“工分主义”者
    和余志明的情况相似，我下放只有三个月，并也曾下过决心要努力劳动、锻炼自己。但是，在我的思想中却是认为工分多即劳动好，以工分来代替又红又专。在我的个人规划里，也曾订出了惊人的工分指标：全年要达到二千个工分，争取三千个工分。在这种思想的指导下，我只拣工分多的重活干、躲避工分少的轻活，推辞不得工分的社会工作和其他工作。别人只挑两块土，我却要挑六块土，每天挣它十几个工分。因此，同志们批评我是工分主义。后来，经过同志们的帮助，使我认识到这种作法是不对的。
    工分主义为甚么不对呢？
    一，下放劳动的目的是为了改造思想，而不是为了工分。对我们来说，劳动，只不过是改造思想的一种方法和手段，而不是目的。最重要的是要通过劳动，使我们成为又红又专的干部。
    二，工分主义，必然会造成脱离群众的后果。因为有这种思想的人，他所想的并不是如何更好地与群众打成一片，共忧同乐，他也不去了解群众需要些什么，讨厌些什么。不肯做群众迫切需要下放干部做的事情，就会脱离群众，脱离了群众，就得不到群众对我们的考验与监督。这样，我们的思想怎么能进步呢？怎么能红呢？
    三，工分主义与党的下放政策的精神不符。下放，是为了我们又红又专。红，就是要忠实于无产阶级，忠实于共产主义事业，坚定为人民服务的决心。大家都知道，为人民服务是不能索取条件和报酬的，只要是对人民有利的而群众又需要的事情，我们都应该坚定不移地去做。所以，那种拒绝做社会工作，只追求工分的工分主义显然是与这种精神背道而驰的。
    为甚么会产生这种工分主义呢？我以为有思想问题也有认识问题。我们这些出身于小资产阶级的知识分子，有一种好走极端的毛病，总是片面地去理解党的政策。党号召我们下放劳动，我们就以为只有劳动，于是就埋在劳动里了，其他的事情全都不管，在当前的重大政治事件面前，表现得若无其事，没有热情，这显然不是一个好现象。下放劳动锻炼，本来是一件伟大的思想改造措施，作为参加这个伟大运动的下放干部，他应当经常地克服自己的非无产阶级思想，但是工分主义者，却是以个人主义来克服自己的个人主义，这怎么能改造好呢？因为他首先想到的不是集体，而是我，把我摆在第一位，从我出发，对我有利的就愿意干，对集体有利而对自己无利的就不愿意去干，难道这不是个人主义吗！所以，下放锻炼是一个劳动的过程，也是一个激烈的思想斗争过程。在这个斗争的过程中，每时每刻都不能放松对自己的改造。
