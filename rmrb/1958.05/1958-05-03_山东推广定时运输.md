Shandong Promotes Scheduled Transportation

(Our newspaper’s Yantai dispatch) Recently, the Shandong Province Highway Transportation Department convened an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the Yantai Automobile Transportation Branch Company in organizing "scheduled transportation." The Party committee secretaries, managers, trade union chairmen, and main cadres of the various automobile transportation branch companies across the province who attended the meeting unanimously affirmed that "scheduled transportation" is a major reform in the current automobile transportation organization work. It can rapidly improve the management level of enterprises and enable automobile transportation to provide more transportation capacity for the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production.

Through airing of views and debates, the meeting criticized the skeptical ideas about scheduled transportation, corrected the concept of cooperation with shipping departments, advocated first "I for everyone," and further clarified the idea of serving industrial and agricultural production and the people's lives, reversing the view that "some waste of manpower and transportation capacity is unavoidable." The participants finally expressed that they would immediately take action, using scheduled transportation as the center of rectification in the Double-Anti movement, to promote a great leap forward in ideology and economy.

    山东推广定时运输
    本报烟台讯　最近山东省公路运输部门召开了现场会议推广烟台汽车运输分公司组织“定时运输”的经验。参加会议的全省各汽车运输分公司的党委书记、经理、工会主席以及科室的主要干部一致肯定了“定时运输”是当前汽车运输组织工作中一项重大的改革，它能迅速提高企业的管理水平，使汽车运输为工农业生产大跃进提供更多的运力。
    会议通过鸣放和辩论，批判了对定时运输的怀疑思想，端正了与托运部门协作的观念，提倡首先“我为人人”，进一步明确了为工农业生产和人民生活服务的思想，扭转了那种“浪费点人力、运输力难以避免”的看法。与会者最后表示：要立即行动起来，以定时运输作为双反运动的整改中心，促使思想上、经济上都来个大跃进。
