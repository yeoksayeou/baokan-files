Title: Favoring the Past and Neglecting the Present in Educational Science

　　The phenomenon of "favoring the past and neglecting the present" exists not only in the teaching of literature and history, but is also serious in the research of educational science. The teachers' favoring the past and neglecting the present is manifested in: on the one hand, introducing a large number of bourgeois books and teaching a large amount of feudal and bourgeois things; on the other hand, talking extensively about the past and foreign countries, but only briefly about the present and China, praising the past and criticizing the present, and requiring students to be "indifferent to fame and wealth to clarify their ambitions, and tranquil to achieve far-reaching goals." Some teachers encourage students to learn from Dong Zhongshu's diligent spirit of "not peeking into the garden for three years," which is actually encouraging detachment from reality. Some teachers openly say in teaching that they are "friends" with Wang Yangming (meaning that they admire Wang Yangming very much). Some teachers say to students: "The laboring people cannot appreciate the clear breeze on the river and the bright moon in the mountains; the cowherd riding on the back of the cow, playing the flute horizontally, cannot feel the beauty himself, only the pastoral poet can feel it." They disapprove of the proletariat's educational policies and important educational measures today.
　　What is more serious is using the past to discuss the present and using the past to explain the present, using feudal and bourgeois viewpoints to interpret communist pedagogy. For example, when some teachers lectured on the chapter "The Purpose and Tasks of Communist Education," they not only mistakenly affirmed that there were collectives in ancient times, but also quoted "Analects" saying "The gentleman does not contend, but if he must, let it be in archery. He bows and yields as he ascends, and drinks as he descends. His contention is that of a gentleman" to illustrate collectivism. In the chapter on "Collectivist Education," they also used the story of Lian Po and Lin Xiangru and "Hemp growing among artemisia becomes straight without being propped" as examples of collectivism. When discussing the relationship between aesthetic education and moral education, they cited an irrelevant example of "Li Bai composes hundreds of poems after drinking a dou of wine, sleeps in a tavern in Chang'an, and refuses to board the boat when the emperor calls, claiming to be an immortal in wine" to illustrate it. This kind of viewpoint of using the past to explain the present and using the past to discuss the present seems to attempt to prove that Marxism also existed in ancient China, and that we had already established a scientific educational system thousands of years ago, thus inevitably distorting the essence of scientific pedagogy and communist moral education.
　　This phenomenon of favoring the past and neglecting the present should be thoroughly criticized so that we can "review the old and know the new" and teach and learn well for the current political tasks.

### 教育科学中的厚古薄今

　　教育科学中的厚古薄今
    “厚古薄今”的现象，不仅在文艺、历史的教学中存在，而且在教育科学的研究中，也是严重的。教师们的厚古薄今，表现在：一方面大量介绍资产阶级的书籍，大量讲授封建的资产阶级的东西，另一方面，纵谈古外，略谈今中，颂古非今，要求学生“淡泊明志、宁静致远”。有的教师鼓励学生学习董仲舒“三年不窥园”的用功精神，实际上是鼓励脱离实际。有的教师在教学中公开说自己同王阳明是“交朋友”（意思是说很崇拜王阳明）。有的教师向学生说：“劳动人民不能欣赏江上的清风，山间的明月；牧童骑在牛背上，短笛横吹，自己感受不到美，只有田园诗人才能感受到”。对待今天无产阶级的教育方针，重要教育措施，却不以为然。
    更严重的是以古论今和以古代今，用封建的资产阶级的观点来解释共产主义教育学。例如有的教师在讲“共产主义教育的目的和任务”一章时，不仅错误地肯定古代也有集体，而且引用“论语”上说的“君子无所争，必也射乎，揖让而升，下而饮，其争也君子”来说明集体主义。在“集体主义教育”一章里也以廉颇和蔺相如的故事和“蓬生麻中，不扶而直”等等作为集体主义的例子。在讲美育和德育的关系时，引用了“李白斗酒诗百篇，长安市上酒家眠，天子呼来不上船，自称臣是酒中仙”这样一个不伦不类的例子来说明。这种以古代今和以古论今的观点，似乎企图证明中国古来也有马克思主义，几千年以前我们早已建立了科学的教育学的体系，因而也就不能不歪曲科学的教育学和共产主义道德教育的本质。
    这种厚古薄今的现象，应该彻底批判，才能“温故而知新”，为当前的政治任务而教好学好。
