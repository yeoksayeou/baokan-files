A Great Change
Hu Dexiang, Director of Beijing Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative

Comrades who frequently visit our cooperative all say that in the past six months, our cooperative has undergone tremendous changes. Indeed, this is all a result of the rectification campaign.

Last year at this time, the collectivist thinking of many cooperative members was still weak, and selfish and self-interested ideas were quite prevalent.

After the great socialist debate in the countryside, the situation completely changed. Cooperative members now regard the cooperative as their own home.

Cherishing public property has become a common practice in our cooperative. Last winter, the cooperative members spontaneously launched a movement to return public property, and within a few days, the entire cooperative returned more than 3,000 agricultural implements, both large and small.

Mutual support and assistance are another new phenomenon in our cooperative. This spring, the Dongguantou Production Team had a heavy task of accumulating fertilizer, and fertilizer sources were scarce. When other teams learned about this, they actively delivered fertilizer to their door to support them. We also supported other fraternal cooperatives. Not long ago, the cooperative selected seven of the best waterwheels and sent them to the Weigezhuang Cooperative in Fengtai District to help them solve the difficulties of drought resistance.

The mental outlook of the cooperative members has changed, and it has also changed the production and cultural life of our cooperative. We not only completed the plans for water conservancy and mechanization of water conservancy ahead of schedule; the plans for eliminating the four pests and planting trees and afforestation have also been realized ahead of schedule. It is estimated that by the end of October this year, the vast majority of young and middle-aged illiterate people can shed their labels.

    一个大变化
    北京东方红农业社主任　胡德祥
    常到我们社里来的同志都说，最近半年，我们社的面貌起了巨大的变化。的确，这都是整风的结果。
    去年这个时候，不少社员的集体主义思想还很淡薄，自私自利的思想相当普遍。
    经过农村社会主义大辩论以后，情况就完全不同了。社员们都把合作社当成了自己的家。
    爱护公共财产，在我们社里已经成了一种风气。去年冬天，社员们自动发起了一次交回公共财产的运动，几天内，全社就交回大小三千多件农具。
    互相支援，彼此帮助，是我们社里的另一个新气象。今春，东管头生产队的积肥任务重，肥源又缺，别的队知道以后，就主动地送肥上门支援他们。我们还支援了其他兄弟社。不久以前，社里就挑选了七部最好的水车，送给丰台区魏各庄合作社，帮助他们解决抗旱的困难。
    社员们的精神面貌变了，也改变了我们社的生产和文化生活面貌。我们不但提前完成了水利化和水利的机械化的计划；除四害、植树造林计划，也都提前实现了。估计到今年10月底，绝大多数青壮年文盲可以摘掉帽子。
