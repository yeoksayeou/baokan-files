After Gao Xizhen, Deputy County Chief of Longhua County, read the eulogy, Li Jingyue, Secretary of the CCP Longhua County Committee, spoke at the meeting.

    Representatives from the unit where Dong Cunrui served before his death also reported on the achievements of the Dong Cunrui class in carrying out the all-around gunner movement: After four days and nights of hard work, they have all been trained as all-around gunners.
    In order to forever commemorate the hero who bravely sacrificed himself for the liberation of Longhua, Dong Cunrui Middle School has decided to build a statue of the hero Dong Cunrui in the school, and all members of the Dong Cunrui Agricultural Production Cooperative guarantee a comprehensive bumper harvest, achieving a yield of seven hundred and twenty catties per mu.
