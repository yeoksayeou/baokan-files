    Today is May 1st International Labor Day, a festival of unity and struggle for the working people of the world, and a festival for the working people of all countries to review their achievements in struggle and construction. Our people today commemorate this great festival with unparalleled excitement and joy, together with the working people of the world.
    From last year's "May Day" to this year's "May Day," a series of tremendous changes have taken place both domestically and internationally. These changes are very beneficial to the socialist cause of our people.
    The rectification movement that began on this day a year ago was a socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts of our people. After the struggle against the rightists and the large-scale rectification and reform against conservatism and waste, decisive victories have been achieved in the struggles on these two fronts. The rampant attacks of the bourgeois rightists have been crushed, bourgeois ideology has been liquidated, and proletarian ideology is flourishing. Throughout the country, from cities to villages, all institutions, enterprises, cooperatives, schools, and military units are posting colorful big-character posters everywhere, and carrying out vigorous debates everywhere. The broad masses are gradually learning to use the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to correctly handle contradictions among the people. The relationship between cadres and the masses has been greatly improved, and bureaucracy, sectarianism, and subjectivism have been greatly changed. Bureaucratic airs, senility, extravagance, arrogance, affectation, and all conservative and wasteful phenomena have been greatly reduced. People's minds have been liberated, and their originality and subjective initiative have been fully utilized. Communist ideology is being greatly developed, and social morality has made great progress. All this has greatly improved relations in all aspects, strengthened political unity, and developed socialist democracy. A political situation has emerged that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and personally relaxed, lively and vigorous. The rectification movement has become a driving force for promoting various tasks.
    Through the rectification movement, the level of awareness of the peasant masses has been greatly improved. Since the winter of 1957, a massive upsurge of socialist production and construction has emerged in the countryside. This upsurge has brought about great leaps forward in all aspects of work such as farmland water conservancy, fertilizer accumulation, soil improvement, improvement of cultivation systems, improvement of agricultural implements, and improvement of cultivation techniques. The great leap forward in farmland water conservancy is particularly astonishing. In one winter and one spring, a total of 17 billion cubic meters of earthwork has been completed nationwide. Anhui Province initially proposed a task of only 800 million cubic meters of earthwork, but has repeatedly exceeded it, and has recently exceeded 5 billion cubic meters. Henan's achievements are even more prominent, having completed more than 6 billion cubic meters of earthwork. As a result of mass water conservancy construction, many areas can now withstand droughts for more than 100 days without rain and prevent floods from rainfall of 200 to 300 millimeters at a time. Low-lying waterlogged areas and saline-alkali areas, which have historically been plagued by natural disasters, have now become fertile and prosperous rice-growing areas. Many desert areas and poor mountain gullies in the Northwest have now become beautiful windbreak forest belts and granaries. As a result of a series of production-increasing measures, this year's summer harvest crops such as wheat and rapeseed are growing particularly well. Without special natural disasters, a bumper summer harvest is a foregone conclusion. The sowing of autumn crops is generally better and more timely than in previous years. At present, all localities are taking more practical measures in every possible way, working hard for another six months, and striving to achieve a bumper harvest this year.
    The rectification movement has also promoted industry and capital construction. The industrial production and capital construction plans for the first five-year plan have been overfulfilled. In 1958, the first year of the second five-year plan, the national industrial production growth rate and the scale of capital construction exceeded any previous year, and the leap forward plans proposed by the staff and workers greatly exceeded the targets set by the state. Judging from the completion of the plan in the first four months of this year, the leap forward plans of many departments will still be greatly exceeded. For example, for coal, the state originally set a production plan of more than 150 million tons this year, but according to the average daily output that has actually been achieved by coal mines across the country, it is entirely possible to break through the leap forward plan of 180 million tons of coal production this year. The implementation of the production plans, construction plans, and variety development plans of other industrial sectors in the first four months of this year shows that the leap forward plans can still be broken through. The call made by the Party Central Committee to catch up with and surpass Britain in major industrial products has greatly inspired the ambition of the working class. They have not only put forward extremely bold leap forward targets, but also launched a technological innovation movement. With their infinite wisdom, the working class has opened the prelude to the technological revolution. Because of the firm implementation of the central policy of simultaneously developing industry by both central and local authorities, and simultaneously developing large-scale and small- and medium-sized enterprises, the enthusiasm for local industry development has been unprecedentedly high. In the short span of four months this year alone, many provinces have built thousands of new factories and mines run by the provinces, prefectures, counties, and townships. More and more facts show that this is a path that can greatly accelerate China's industrialization.
    The rectification movement has also promoted the leap forward in cultural, educational, and health undertakings. At present, illiteracy elimination work has made great progress nationwide. Heilongjiang has basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and many other provinces also plan to eliminate illiteracy this year. Not only has it become a common phenomenon for every cooperative to run primary schools and every township to run middle schools, but also universities run by prefectures and universities run by counties have emerged. The "eliminate the four pests" campaign has formed a nationwide assault movement in urban and rural areas, and paying attention to hygiene is becoming a trend. "Culture going to the countryside" and "culture going to the mountains" are becoming action slogans. The national situation shows that a cultural upsurge is forming. Other areas such as commerce, transportation, and public security are also showing a leap forward. The entire domestic situation is very exciting.
    The international situation is also very favorable to us. The East wind now prevails over the West wind. Since the Soviet artificial satellite went into space and the Communist and Workers' Parties held a meeting in Moscow, the peaceful construction of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union has achieved new successes, demonstrating to the world the infinite vigor and vitality of the socialist system. The opposite is true for the imperialist camp. The dark clouds of economic crisis have enveloped the entire capitalist world, and the United States has already experienced a periodic economic crisis. In recent years, the superficial "prosperity" of capitalist countries has been shattered, and the inherent contradictions of imperialism are becoming increasingly acute. Now, the call for easing international tensions and maintaining world peace is becoming louder and louder. The Soviet Union's initiative to convene a summit meeting has taken root in the hearts of the people. US imperialism and its lackeys are becoming increasingly passive and isolated.
    Today, while commemorating the May 1st International Labor Day, the people of our country are full of confidence in the face of this very favorable domestic and international situation. We must go all out, aim high, and build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. We must carry the rectification movement through to the end, fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people of the whole country, strive to achieve the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, strive to surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products in less than fifteen years, and strive to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution more quickly, so as in the shortest possible time to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, modern science and culture.

    争取更大的劳动成果
    今天是五一国际劳动节，这是全世界劳动人民团结斗争的节日，也是各国劳动人民检阅斗争和建设成就的节日。我国人民今天怀着无比的兴奋和欢乐，同全世界劳动人民一道，来纪念这个伟大的节日。
    从去年的“五一”到今年的“五一”，这一年间无论在我国国内和国际上，都发生了一系列的巨大的变化。这些变化，十分有利于我国人民的社会主义事业。
    一年前的今天开始的整风运动，是我国人民在政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。经过了反右派斗争和反保守、反浪费的大整大改，这两条战线上的斗争已经取得了决定性的胜利。资产阶级右派的猖狂进攻被粉碎了，资产阶级的思想被清算了，无产阶级的思想兴旺起来了。全国各地，从城市到农村，所有的机关、企业、合作社、学校、军队，到处张贴五光十色的大字报，到处蓬蓬勃勃地展开大辩论，广大群众正逐渐学会用“团结——批评——团结”的方法，正确地处理人民内部的矛盾。干部和群众的关系已经大为改善，官僚主义、宗派主义和主观主义有了很大的改变，官气、暮气、阔气、骄气、娇气和一切保守、浪费的现象大为减少了。人们的思想获得了解放，充分发挥了独创精神和主观能动性。共产主义的思想正大大发扬起来，社会风气有了很大进步。这一切就大大地改进了各方面的关系，增强了政治上的团结，发展了社会主义的民主。一个既有集中又有民主、既有纪律又有自由、既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面已经出现了。整风运动成了推进各项工作的动力。
    经过整风运动，农民群众的觉悟程度大大提高。1957年冬季以来，农村中出现了排山倒海的社会主义生产建设高潮。这一高潮带来了农田水利、积肥、改良土壤、改进耕作制度、改良农具、改进耕作技术等各方面工作的大跃进。农田水利大跃进特别惊人，一冬一春，全国共做了一百七十亿土方。安徽省开始只提出八亿土方的任务，后来一再超过，最近已突破了五十亿土方。河南的成绩更加突出，已经完成了六十多亿土方。群众性水利建设的结果，许多地区现在已经可以做到一百多天不下雨不会受旱，一次落雨二三百公厘不会受涝。历史上自然灾害深重的低洼涝地和盐碱地区，现在变成了肥沃富裕的水稻地区。西北的许多沙漠地带和穷山沟，如今变成了美丽的防风林带和米粮川。由于采取一系列增产措施的结果，今年夏收作物小麦、油菜等生长格外良好。如果没有特殊天灾，夏季大丰收已成定局。大秋作物的播种，一般也较往年做得更好更及时。目前各地正更加切实地千方百计地采取措施，再接再厉苦战六个月，实现今年大丰收。
    整风运动也推动了工业和基本建设。第一个五年的工业生产和基本建设计划已超额完成了。第二个五年计划的第一年——1958年国家拟定的工业生产发展速度和基本建设规模超过以往任何一年，职工群众提出的跃进计划又大大超过了国家规定的指标。从今年头四个月完成计划的情况来看，许多部门的跃进计划仍将被大大超过。例如煤炭，国家原定今年生产计划是一亿五千多万吨，但据目前全国煤矿实际上已经达到的平均日产量推算，今年全国煤炭产量突破一亿八千万吨的跃进计划，是完全有可能的。其他各工业部门今年头四个月的生产计划、建设计划和发展品种计划的执行情况，表明了跃进计划还可以突破。党中央提出的关于在主要工业生产品方面赶上英国、超过英国的号召，大大激励了工人阶级的志气。他们不仅提出了极其大胆的跃进指标，而且展开了技术革新运动。工人阶级以自己无穷的智慧，揭开了技术革命的序幕。因为坚决执行了中央工业和地方工业同时并举、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，地方办工业的积极性空前高涨。仅在今年短短的四个月中，许多省份就已建成了成千个省办的、专区办的、县办的和乡办的新厂矿。越来越多的事实表明，这是一条能够大大加速我国工业化的道路。
    整风运动也推动了文化教育卫生事业的跃进。目前全国扫盲工作有了很大开展，黑龙江已在青壮年中基本上扫除了文盲，还有好些省也计划今年内扫除文盲；不但社社办小学、乡乡办中学已成为普遍现象，而且专区办大学、县办大学也已经出现了。除四害已经在全国城乡形成突击运动，讲卫生正成为风气。“文化下乡”、“文化上山”正成为行动口号。全国情况显示，一个文化高潮正在形成。其他如商业、交通运输、政法工作，也呈现跃进的局面。整个国内形势是十分令人兴奋的。
    国际形势也对我们十分有利，现在是东风压倒了西风。自从苏联人造卫星上了天，共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行会议以来，以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的和平建设又取得了新的成就，向全世界显示出社会主义制度无限旺盛和充沛的生命力。而帝国主义阵营恰恰相反，经济危机的阴暗景象已笼罩着整个资本主义世界，美国已经首先爆发了周期性的经济危机。近些年来，资本主义国家表面的“景气”、“繁荣”破灭了，帝国主义所固有的各种矛盾正在日益尖锐化。现在，和缓国际紧张局势、维护世界和平的呼声正越来越响亮。苏联关于召开最高级会议的创议，已经深入人心。美帝国主义及其仆从正越来越陷于被动和孤立。
    今天，在纪念五一国际劳动节的时候，我国人民面对这十分有利的国内外形势，信心百倍。我们一定要鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。我们一定要把整风运动胜利进行到底，充分发挥全国人民的积极性和创造性，争取提前实现全国农业发展纲要，争取不用十五年就在主要工业产品产量方面超过英国，争取更快地进行技术革命和文化革命，以便在尽可能短的时间内把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
