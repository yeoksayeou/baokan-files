(Xinhua News Agency, May 5th) An exhibition showcasing the enormous ideological and productive achievements of transferred cadres—the Anhui Financial and Trade System's Exhibition of Production Achievements by Transferred Cadres—opened in Beijing on the 5th. This exhibition was organized by the Central Financial and Trade Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Fifth Office of the State Council to promote the experience of the Anhui Province Financial and Trade System in organizing cadres to participate in industrial and agricultural production.

The exhibition displays various products produced by the nine thousand cadres from the Anhui Financial and Trade System who were transferred to factories and farms last year. It also uses charts and photographs to introduce the new changes in the ideological outlook of these cadres during labor training. The exhibition uses vivid facts to illustrate that organizing transferred cadres to run factories and farms is a successful path to cultivating cadres to be both red and expert and to solving the problem of overstaffing in government offices and enterprises. At the same time, the transferred cadres, by establishing small-scale industries in accordance with local conditions and making use of simple and crude methods, have also played a positive role in promoting local industrial development.

In February of last year, before the nationwide trend of transferring cadres for labor training, the Anhui Financial and Trade System, under the correct leadership and unified planning of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, took the lead in combining streamlining institutions with transferring cadres to the industrial and agricultural labor front. In addition to some people returning to their hometowns for production, 9,036 transferred cadres were concentrated to develop barren mountains, establish agricultural, forestry, and livestock farms, and develop small-scale local industries. Over the past year, a total of 7.8 million yuan has been invested to establish 385 industrial and agricultural production units. By the end of last year, the total output value of these units had reached more than 23 million yuan, and many factories were not only self-sufficient but also had surpluses.

The charts on display at the exhibition show that these cadres have undergone profound ideological changes after participating in labor, with many people shifting from underestimating labor to loving labor. A series of cartoons introduce the self-narration of a cadre named Zhang Chaoxian. When the Party called on cadres to participate in labor, he enthusiastically responded, expressing his desire to dedicate his youth to the motherland. However, after arriving at the desolate Zhouwang Farm, he was intimidated by the difficulties. He did not believe that transferred cadres could change this desolate landscape. He wrote nine resignation reports in three months, requesting to seek another way out. After patient education from the farm's Party organization and the help of his comrades, he finally overcame his backward thinking. After a period of labor training, he has now become an active element in production. He said: "I have fallen in love with the farm and am willing to work here for the rest of my life." There were quite a few cadres who were initially uneasy about labor production, but now they have undergone great changes. They are not only at ease with labor but have also developed deep feelings for the production gardens they have opened up with their own hands. Currently, more than 100 couples have settled down at the Zhouwang Farm. Many intellectuals who were originally "unaccustomed to physical labor and ignorant of the five grains" have now learned a full set of agricultural production techniques. Some cadres who used to cover their noses when they saw manure now regard it as a treasure. Once, a cadre from Zhouwang Farm who was a college graduate was returning from outside and saw a pile of cow dung on the road. However, he did not have any tools to pick up the manure, and he felt it would be a pity to lose it, so he finally wrapped the pile of cow dung in his coat and brought it back to the farm.

After people recognized the great significance of labor, they generated infinite wisdom and courage to overcome difficulties in production. These transferred cadres not only mastered technology in a short period of time but also had many valuable inventions and creations. In the exhibition hall, visitors can see many "new products" they produced. Cadres from the Bengbu City Supply and Marketing Cooperative used discarded pig bristles and wool (or regenerated cotton) to blend and make beautiful yarn, blankets, and woolen uniforms. Although the material is rough, it is durable and inexpensive, and very popular among the masses. The Bengbu Pig Bristle Textile Factory has produced 5,000 catties of pig bristle yarn, which can weave 1,200 sweaters. The colorful silk hanging in the exhibition hall is the product of the newly built Hefei Silk Weaving Factory. Although more than 50 counties in Anhui Province produce silk, there was no silk weaving factory in the past. More than 150 cadres transferred from the Commercial Department established this silk weaving factory. After several months of learning and trial production, they are now able to produce a variety of products such as Hailimeng, Four Seasons呢, and silk yarn. The transferred cadres of the Coal Construction Company under the Commercial Department have also successfully tested "local method of coking," with a coking rate of 60%; recently, they have also successfully tested the extraction of coal tar during the coking process. The 36 mobile rice processing factories run by transferred cadres from the Grain Department are extremely popular among farmers. The exhibition features a model of this rice processing factory, which has only a set of lightweight rice milling machines, with rubber wheels underneath, which can be pushed or disassembled and transported on small boats. As long as there is a small house, it can be processed. In addition, the transferred cadres also made 50 to 80-proof liquor from rice bran cakes; extracted mountain changzi oil, which can be used as a spice, from wild mountain changzi; made lotus root powder from wild lotus roots; and extracted high-quality diesel and lubricating oil from waste engine oil, etc., to supply the local people. These products were either not produced or produced very little in Anhui Province in the past, and most of them had to rely on processing and supply from other places.

From the exhibition, one can also see that the transferred cadres have created miracles on the agricultural front. With perseverance, they have developed the originally desolate Baimi Mountain and Zhouwangzhuang mountainous areas into prosperous mountainous areas where agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry are developed simultaneously. Last year, Zhouwang Farm harvested more than 1 million catties of agricultural products such as sweet potatoes, peanuts, and sesame, planted 1 million economic trees, and raised more than 7,000 heads of livestock and poultry of various kinds. More than 1,000 houses were built on open spaces, and health stations and sanatoriums were established, and the appearance has been completely changed.

The production undertakings of the transferred cadres in Anhui Province are carried out under the guidance of the policy put forward by the Anhui Provincial Party Committee of the CPC: "Small investment, quick results, available raw materials, sales channels, not competing with the people for profits, and combining with the business of the commercial departments themselves as much as possible." Therefore, these production enterprises fully embody the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results, and building the country through diligence and frugality. When cadres transferred from the Huainan City Grain Bureau were preparing to build a feed processing plant, they used old reed mats covering rice bran to build a factory building, pieced together parts of several scrapped machines, made machines, and spent only 500 yuan to build a simple factory in 20 days. Now they are using their accumulated funds to build a new factory building, and all the machines are electric, so people praise this factory as a model of "building a factory through diligence and frugality."

The exhibition is being held at the Beijing Working People's Cultural Palace and is scheduled to last for one month.

### 培养干部又红又专　解决机关企业人浮于事  看，组织干部办工厂农场的巨大收获  安徽财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会在北京开幕

    培养干部又红又专　解决机关企业人浮于事
    看，组织干部办工厂农场的巨大收获
    安徽财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会在北京开幕
    据新华社5日讯　一个显示下放干部思想上、生产上巨大成果的展览会——安徽财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会，5日在北京开幕。这是中共中央财贸部和国务院第五办公室为推广安徽省财贸系统组织干部参加工农业生产的经验而举办的。
    展览会展出了安徽省财贸系统去年下放到工厂和农场的九千名干部生产出来的各种产品，并且以图表、照片介绍了这些干部在劳动锻炼中思想面貌的新变化。展览会用生动的事实说明了组织下放干部举办工厂、农场是培养干部又红又专和解决机关企业人浮于事的一条成功的道路；同时下放干部因地制宜、因陋就简地举办一些小型工业，对于促进地方工业发展也起了良好的作用。
    去年2月，在全国还没有普遍下放干部进行劳动锻炼之前，安徽省财贸系统在中共安徽省委正确领导和统一规划下，就首先结合紧缩机构，把干部下放到工农业劳动战线上去，其中除了一部分人回乡生产以外，有九千零三十六名下放的干部集中起来开发荒山，建立农林牧场和发展小型地方工业。一年来共投资七百八十万元，建立了三百八十五个工农业生产单位。到去年年底，这些单位的生产总值已达二
  千三百多万元，许多工厂不但能自给，还有了盈余。
    展览会上陈列的图表说明，这批干部参加劳动以后思想上发生了
  深刻的变化，许多人由轻视劳动转变到热爱劳动。有一组连环画介绍了一个名叫张朝贤的干部的自述，他在党号召干部参加劳动时，曾热烈响应号召，表示要把青春献给祖国，但是到了一片荒芜的周王农场后，他被困难吓倒了，他不相信下放干部能够改变这种荒凉的面貌，三个月内连写九次退职报告，要求另谋生路，经过农场党组织耐心的教育和同志们的帮助，他终于战胜了自己的落后思想，经过一个时期的劳动锻炼，现在已成为生产中的积极分子。他说：我爱上了农场，愿意在这里劳动一辈子。像他这样不安心于劳动生产的干部一开始是不少的，现在都有了很大的转变，他们不但安心劳动，而且对自己用双手开辟出来的生产园地发生了深厚的感情。周王农场目前已经有一百多对夫妇在那里安家落户。许多原来“四体不勤、五谷不分”的知识分子，现在学会了全套农业生产技术。有些干部过去看到粪便掩鼻而过，现在把它当作宝贝。有一次周王农场的一个大学生出身的干部从外面回来，路上看到一堆牛粪，但他没有带拾粪的工具，又觉得丢了可惜，终于用自己的外衣把这堆牛粪包起来带回了农场。
    人们在认识了劳动的伟大意义后，生产中就产生了无穷的智慧和克服困难的勇气。这些下放干部不但在很短时间内掌握了技术，而且有了许多可贵的发明创造。在展览室里，观众可以看到他们生产的许多“新产品”。蚌埠市供销社的干部用过去丢弃掉的猪毛绒和羊毛（或更生棉）混纺，做成了美丽的毛线、毛毯和毛料制服，虽然质料粗糙，但经久耐穿、价格便宜，很受群众欢迎。蚌埠猪毛绒纺织厂已生产猪毛绒五千斤，可织毛衣一千二百件。高悬在展览馆大厅上的五色缤纷的彩绸，是新建的合肥织绸厂的产品。安徽省虽然有五十多个县出产蚕丝，但是过去一座织绸厂也没有。商业厅下放的一百五十多个干部建立了这座织绸厂，经过几个月的学习试制，现在他们已经能生产海立蒙、四季呢、丝羽纱等多种产品了。商业厅所属煤建公司的下放干部还试验成功了“土法炼焦”，出焦率达到60％；最近他们又试验在炼焦过程中提取煤焦油，也获得成功。粮食厅下放干部举办的三十六个流动加工米厂，极受农民欢迎。展览会上陈列着这种加工米厂的模型，它只有一套很轻便的碾米机器，下面装着橡皮轮，可以推着走，也可以拆下来装在小船上运输。只要有一间小房子，它就可以进行加工。此外，下放干部还用米糠饼制成了五十度到八十度的烧酒；把野生的山苍子榨成了可以作香料的山苍子油；用野藕做藕粉；从废机油里提炼出上等的柴油和润滑油等等，供应当地群众。这些产品都是安徽省过去不能生产或生产很少，大部分要依靠外地加工、供应的。
    从展览会上还可以看到下放干部在农业战线上也创造了奇迹。他们用坚韧不拔的毅力，把原来荒无人烟的白米山、周王庄山区，开发成为农林牧各种经济同时发展的繁荣的山区。周王农场去年收获甘薯、花生、芝麻等农产品共一百多万斤，种植经济林一百万株，饲养各种牲畜、家禽七千多头，在空地上盖起了一千多间房屋，建立了卫生站、疗养所，面貌已经完全改观。
    安徽省下放干部的生产事业，是在中共安徽省委提出的“投资少，收效快，有原料，有销路，不与民争利，并且尽可能地和商业部门本身业务相结合”的方针下举办起来的，因此这些生产企业充分体现了多快好省、勤俭建国的方针。淮南市粮食局的下放干部在筹建一个饲料加工厂时，用盖米糠的旧芦席搭了一个厂房，把几部报废机器的零件拼凑起来，做成机器，只花了五百元投资，用二十天的时间就建成了一个简陋的工厂。现在他们用自己积累的资金，兴建了一座新的厂房，机器也全部是电动的，因此人们称赞这个工厂是“勤俭建厂”的典范。
    这个展览会在北京劳动人民文化宫举行，预定展览一个月。
