Lanzhou Builds a Batch of Small and Medium-Sized Factories
Utilizing Waste Materials from Large Factories

(Our newspaper, Lanzhou, 15th) In order to fully utilize the edge materials, waste materials, and by-products of large factories for production, Lanzhou City has decided to build a batch of small and medium-sized factories, more than ten of which can be put into production before the end of this year.

Lanzhou City is building giant enterprises for chemical engineering, oil refining, power generation, and machinery manufacturing, some of which have been partially completed. Starting from the fourth quarter of this year, some factories will be put into production one after another. In the future, in addition to producing petroleum products, fertilizers, synthetic rubber, heavy oil drilling rigs, chemical equipment, and other means of production in batches, these large enterprises will also generate a large number of by-products, and tens of thousands of tons of waste gas and waste materials. The metal shavings cut from machine tools in the Petroleum Machinery Factory and the Petrochemical Equipment Factory alone amount to 10,000 tons a year. The stainless steel edge plates and scraps cut by the Petrochemical Equipment Factory every year are also over 400 tons. The Lanzhou Refinery also produces more than 20,000 tons of electrode coke and tens of thousands of tons of dry gas every year. The Lanzhou Thermal Power Plant, Lanzhou Chemical Plant, and other four enterprises discharge as many as 40,000 tons of coal ash and coal slag in one year. In order to make full use of these waste materials, waste gas, and by-products, Lanzhou City has decided to build a batch of small and medium-sized factories. These include a recycled steel plant that uses metal shavings and scrap steel as raw materials and produces 6,000 tons of steel annually, a furnace ash products plant that uses coal ash and coal slag as raw materials and produces 40,000 tons of lightweight building materials annually, a small factory that uses stainless steel edge plates and scraps to make medical equipment and daily hardware, a calcium cyanamide fertilizer factory that uses waste gas to produce 20,000 tons annually, and factories for plastics, batteries, and soap. These factories will be built as large industries are gradually put into production.

The construction of these small and medium-sized factories, from process design to solving some production equipment, must rely on the strong support of large factories. Because these local industries adopt general technical equipment, the construction time is short and the investment is also small. For example, building a recycled steel plant with an annual output of 6,000 tons of steel requires only 450,000 yuan of investment. (Guo Fenxiang)

　　兰州建设一批中小型工厂
    利用大厂的边材废料
    本报兰州15日电　兰州市为了充分利用大工厂的边材、废料和副产品进行生产，决定建设一批中小型工厂，其中有十多个工厂可以在今年年底前投入生产。
    兰州市正在建设化工、炼油、发电、机械制造等巨型企业，有的已经部分建成，从今年第四季度开始，还将有一部分工厂陆续投入生产。这批大企业将来除要成批地生产石油成品、化肥、人造橡胶、重型石油钻机、化工设备等生产资料外，还产生大量副产品、成千成万吨的废气、废料。其中仅石油机械厂和石油化工设备厂从机床上削下的金属切屑，一年就有一万吨，石油化工设备厂每年裁下的不锈钢边板、边料，也在四百吨以上。兰州炼油厂每年也产生二万多吨的电极焦和数万吨的干气，兰州热电站、兰州化工厂等四个企业，一年内排除的煤灰、煤渣达四万吨之多。为了充分利用这些废料废气和副产品，兰州市决定建设一批中小型工厂。其中有利用金属切屑和废钢铁做原料，年产六千吨钢的再生钢厂，有利用煤灰、煤渣做原料，年产四万吨轻体建筑材料的炉灰制品厂，有利用不锈钢边板边料做医疗器械和日用五金的小工厂，有利用废气来建设年产二万吨的石灰氮肥工厂，还有塑料、电池、肥皂等工厂。这批工厂将随着大工业的陆续投入生产而建设起来。
    这批中小型工厂的建设，从进行工艺设计，到解决部分生产设备，都要依靠大工厂大力支援。这些地方工业因为采用一般技术装备，建设时间短，投资也较少。如建设一座年产六千吨钢的再生钢厂，只要四十五万元投资。　（郭汾祥）
