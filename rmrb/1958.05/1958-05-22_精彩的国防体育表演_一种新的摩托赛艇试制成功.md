    Wonderful National Defense Sports Performances
    A New Type of Motorboat Successfully Trial-Produced

    This newspaper reports that recently, the Shenyang Municipal National Defense Sports Association conducted stunt performances of military dogs, motorcycles, aviation models, gliders, Yak-18 trainers, and skydiving at the Municipal People's Stadium, Beiguan Stadium, and the gliding airport.

    Among them, the military dog performance aroused great interest. The military dog performance this time was performed by two dogs from the National Defense Sports Association's military dog training group, demonstrating basic actions: sitting, lying down, retrieving, jumping over obstacles, attacking, scent tracking, and rescue. The "rescue" item, in particular, was very exciting. The enemy tied up the dog's owner with ropes. When the dog discovered this, it bit through the ropes one by one to rescue its owner, then tracked down the enemy who tied up its owner by scent, engaged in combat with the enemy, and finally escorted the enemy away, which were all exciting actions.

    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 19th - Yesterday afternoon, a new type of motorboat appeared on the Songhua River in Harbin, attracting the attention of tourists on both banks of the Songhua River. This was the "Mars-25" motorboat, recently successfully trial-produced by the state-owned Dong'an Machinery Factory, holding a launching test performance.

    During the performance, the "Mars-25" motorboat advanced through the waves on the wide Songhua River like an arrow. A Canadian Sea Leopard speedboat from the Harbin River Club, performing alongside it, was left far behind despite running at maximum horsepower. The spectators constantly applauded and cheered in congratulation. After testing and evaluation, the quality of the speedboat was very good.

    This motorboat has the characteristics of being lightweight, having high horsepower (23 horsepower), and being fast. It can travel up to 120 kilometers per hour at its fastest. It is a good sports tool for national defense athletes. (Attached picture)

    新华社哈尔滨19日电　18日下午，哈尔滨松花江面上出现一种新型的摩托赛艇，吸引着松花江两岸游客们的注意。这是国营东安机械厂最近试制成功的“火星—二十五”型摩托赛艇举行下水试验表演。
    在表演的时候，“火星—二十五”摩托赛艇在宽阔的松花江上，像箭一样地破浪前进。和它一起表演的哈尔滨江上俱乐部的一艘加拿大海豹式赛艇，尽管以最大的马力行驶，但仍被远远地抛落在后面。观看的人们不断鼓掌欢呼祝贺。经过试验鉴定，赛艇质量很好。
    这种摩托赛艇具有体轻、马力大（二十三马力）、速度快的特点，每小时最快能行一百二十公里，它是国防体育运动员的一种良好运动器具。（附图片）
