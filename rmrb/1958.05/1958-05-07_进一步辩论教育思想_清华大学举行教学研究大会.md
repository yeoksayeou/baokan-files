Further Debate on Educational Thought
Tsinghua University Holds Teaching Research Conference

    (Our newspaper dispatch) In order to distinguish between the two paths in educational work, implement the general line of socialist construction, and strive for a great leap forward in education, Tsinghua University held a teaching debate conference for all teachers on the evening of the 6th (this is the eleventh teaching research conference held by Tsinghua University after the tenth teaching research conference held in 1956). In addition to all teachers of Tsinghua University, many teachers from brother higher industrial schools in Beijing also attended the meeting. Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education, also attended the conference.
    This conference was held on the basis that teachers and students initially resolved the "red versus expert" issue during the "Double-Anti" movement. The current new situation of the national production great leap forward, as well as the arrival of the technological revolution and cultural revolution, have put forward urgent new tasks for higher industrial education. It is necessary to draw a clear line between the two roads, adhere to the socialist education line, thoroughly criticize the capitalist education line, and resolutely implement and execute the general line of socialist construction, setting off a profound new educational reform. The conference will use the method of presenting facts and reasoning to debate issues from the aspects of teaching objectives and tasks, teaching content and methods, teaching organization and leadership, and the position of teaching work in the school. It will give a systematic and powerful criticism of capitalist education that is divorced from politics, divorced from production, and divorced from reality, and its serious harmfulness. The conference will also especially focus on the issue of reforming teaching work that can no longer adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in national production, with its emphasis on achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results and the simultaneous development of large, medium, and small factories and enterprises, so as to cultivate a large number of red engineers who are suitable for the current actual needs of national construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    Prior to this conference, various departments and teaching and research groups of Tsinghua University had enthusiastically launched a great debate on the two roads of teaching work. The teachers deeply felt the necessity of this great teaching debate and actively participated in this debate. Many departments also held teaching exhibitions, exposing various manifestations of bourgeois ideology in teaching work. Many departments also invited leaders from industrial sectors to the school to report on the policies and situations of the great leap forward in various industries.
    Jiang Nanxiang, President of Tsinghua University, made a brief speech at the teaching debate conference. He said that in the midst of the national socialist great leap forward, holding this teaching debate conference on the basis of the "Double-Anti" movement is a major event in the life of the school. In order to make the school leap forward on the socialist road, it is necessary to carry out educational reform in depth on the basis of the past, resolutely implement the Party's educational policy, and implement the mass line in running the school.
    At the meeting, Vice Presidents Chen Shihua and Zhang Wei, and Presidential Assistants Chen Shunyao and Li Shouchi, jointly presented a report entitled "Draw a Clear Line Between the Two Roads, Implement the General Line of Socialist Construction, and Strive for a Great Leap Forward in Educational Work!" which was read by Vice President Chen Shihua. The report pointed out that the purpose of this conference is that the new situation of socialist construction has put forward new topics for the school's teaching work. In order to adapt to this new situation, it is necessary to carry out a great debate on the two lines of teaching in depth on the existing basis, and to carry out another profound new educational reform. He used a large number of facts to illustrate the achievements of Tsinghua University's teaching reform in recent years, and powerfully refuted the fallacies of right-wing elements such as Qian Weichang within the school, who slandered Tsinghua University as "not as good as before," "not developing much," and "standing still," and pointed out the harm of the bourgeois educational road to Tsinghua's teaching reform in recent years.
    The report said: The main arguments of the bourgeois educational road are that education has nothing to do with politics, education is divorced from production, and theory is divorced from practice; they oppose determining clear training goals according to the needs of socialist construction, oppose teaching being connected with production practice, oppose planned training of cadres, and oppose Party leadership and the mass line. These views are ideological reflections of capitalist politics and economics, serve capitalist politics and economics, and are based on an idealistic world view and epistemology.
    The report also said: The theory and practice of the bourgeois educational line are manifested in: advocating individualism and supra-class viewpoints, denying the class nature of education, and opposing Marxism-Leninism. Advocating the views of "science above all else" and "pure technology," and opposing technology serving politics. Disdaining labor, disdaining production, and disdaining workers and peasants, so that teaching is separated from production and theory is divorced from practice. Advocating "genius education," saying that geniuses are born, and the purpose of education is to discover "geniuses," and that one "genius" is better than one hundred middle-level students. Saying that the cultivation of "geniuses" must be based on "free competition" and strict "elimination," and that having purpose, planning, and leadership will not produce geniuses. Therefore, they advocate that the opposition between mental and physical labor is innate and oppose the planned cultivation of students' ability to work independently. They advocate the "expert line" and oppose Party leadership and the mass line.
    After exposing and criticizing a series of reactionary views of bourgeois education, the report pointed out that teachers must intensify ideological transformation and thoroughly draw a clear line between the two roads from the root. In the future, in the new situation, it is necessary to implement the general line of socialist construction and strive for a great leap forward in teaching work. That is to say, it is necessary to examine and improve the entire educational work in accordance with the general line of socialist construction and the construction policy of combining large, medium, and small-scale projects. On the original basis, continue to study the advanced experience of the Soviet Union in depth, summarize the valuable experience of the Chinese people, create new experiences in realizing the principles of socialist education under China's existing conditions, and new experiences in applying advanced science and technology in the Chinese environment. To create a large red and expert technical force and a large number of strong technical backbones for carrying out the technological revolution. How to achieve this requirement? The key issue is to closely integrate education and production. On the one hand, the training objectives, the breadth of majors, and the content of teaching, etc., should be determined according to the needs of national production and production technology policies; at the same time, it is necessary to clarify that education is the center of the school, and that teaching, scientific research, and production should complement each other and be correctly combined. It is necessary to actively organize all teachers and students to directly participate in on-campus and off-campus production work, and according to the training objectives and the teaching principle of linking theory with practice, to appropriately organize production work into the teaching process. According to the above spirit, the school should plan and step-by-step revise teaching plans, teaching outlines, and various teaching method documents, and vigorously improve teaching quality. At the same time, it is necessary to further increase the number of worker-peasant students, actively establish new majors, and cultivate a red teachers' team. The report finally emphasized that in order to launch this new educational reform, the key issue is to strengthen the Party's leadership and implement the mass line in all aspects of education, scientific research, and other work.
    Finally, Qisijiakov, the leader of the Soviet expert group at Tsinghua University, gave a report to the conference on "Continuously Improving the Quality of Educational Work—The Most Important Task of Soviet Higher Education." He emphasized that the integration of teaching with production is an important aspect of continuously improving the quality of teaching.
    The conference continued to unfold debates in various departments and teaching and research groups from the 7th.

    进一步辩论教育思想
    清华大学举行教学研究大会
    本报讯　为了划清教育工作中的两条道路，贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，争取教育工作的大跃进，6日晚，清华大学举行了全校教师的教学辩论大会（这是清华大学继1956年召开的第十次教学研究会以后举行的第十一次教学研究会）。参加会议的除清华大学全体教师外，还有许多北京各兄弟高等工业学校的教师。教育部部长杨秀峰也参加了大会。
    这次大会是在双反运动中，教师、学生初步解决了红专问题的基础上召开的。目前全国生产大跃进的新形势，以及技术革命、文化革命的到来，给高等工业教育提出了迫切的新任务，必须划清两条道路，坚持社会主义教育路线，彻底批驳资本主义教育路线，并为坚决贯彻和执行社会主义建设的总路线，掀起一个深刻的新的教育改革。会议将以摆事实、讲道理的方式，和从教学目的和任务、教学内容和方法、教学组织和领导，以及教学工作在学校中的地位等问题进行辩论，对脱离政治、脱离生产、脱离实际的资本主义教育和它的严重危害性，给以系统的有力的批判。会议还将特别针对着已不能适应当前祖国生产大跃进中多快好省和大型、中型、小型工厂企业齐发展的新形势下的教学工作的改革问题展开讨论，以便多快好省地培养出大批适合于当前祖国建设实际的红色工程师。
    在这个大会举行以前，清华大学各系与教研组都已热烈展开了教学工作两条道路的大辩论，教师们深深地感到这次教学大辩论的必要性，他们积极地投入这场辩论中。许多系还举办了教学展览会，揭露了教学工作中形形色色的资产阶级思想。不少系还邀请了产业部门的负责人来校报告各方面工业大跃进的方针和情况。
    清华大学校长蒋南翔在教学辩论大会上作了简短的讲话。他说，在全国社会主义大跃进当中，学校在双反运动基础上举行这个教学辩论大会，这是学校生活中的一件大事。为了使学校在社会主义道路上大跃进，必须在过去基础上深入进行教育改革，坚决执行党的教育方针，并在办学中贯彻群众路线。
    会上，副校长陈士骅、张维、校长助理陈舜瑶、李寿慈等四人共同提出了题为“划清两条道路，贯彻执行社会主义建设的总路线，争取教育工作的大跃进！”的报告，由陈士骅副校长宣读。报告指出：这次大会的目的，是由于在社会主义建设的新形势下，给学校教学工作提出了新的课题。为了适应这种新形势，必须在现有的基础上，深入地开展教学两条路线的大辩论，再进行一次深刻的新的教学改革。他以大量的事实说明清华大学几年来教学改革的成绩，并通过事实有力地驳斥了校内钱伟长等右派分子诬蔑清华大学“今不如昔”、“发展不大”、“踏步不前”等谬论，并指出几年来资产阶级教育道路对清华教学改革的危害性。
    报告中说：资产阶级教育道路主要论点就是认为教育与政治无关，教育与生产脱离，理论与实际脱离；他们反对根据社会主义建设需要确定明确的培养目标，反对教学联系生产实际，反对有计划地培养干部，并反对党的领导和群众路线。这些观点是资本主义政治经济在意识形态上的反映，是为资本主义政治经济服务的，是建立在唯心主义的世界观和认识论之上的。
    报告又说：资产阶级教育路线的理论与实践表现为：宣扬个人主义和超阶级观点，否认教育的阶级性，反对马列主义。宣扬“科学至上”和“单纯技术”观点，反对技术服从政治。鄙视劳动、鄙视生产、鄙视工农，使教学与生产分离，理论与实际脱节。宣扬“天才教育”，说什么天才是天生的，教育目的就是发现“天才”，一百个中等学生不如一个“天才”。说什么“天才”的培养必须“自由竞争”，严格“淘汰”，有目的，有计划，有领导，就不能出天才。因而他们宣扬脑力劳动与体力劳动的对立是天生的，反对有计划地培养学生独立工作能力。他们宣扬“专家路线”，反对党的领导和群众路线。
    报告揭露和批驳了资产阶级教育的一系列反动观点以后，指出教师必须加紧思想改造，从根本上彻底划清两条道路。今后在新的形势下必须贯彻实行社会主义建设的总路线，争取教学工作的大跃进。这就是说，要按照社会主义建设的总路线和大、中、小相结合的建设方针来检查和改进整个教育工作。在原有基础上，继续深入学习苏联先进经验，总结中国人民的宝贵经验，创造出在中国现有条件下实现社会主义教育原则的新经验，和在中国环境中运用先进科学技术的新经验。为开展技术革命创造一支又红又专的技术大军和大批坚强的技术骨干。如何达到这种要求呢？关键问题是使教育和生产密切结合起来。一方面按照全国生产的需要和生产技术政策来决定培养目标、专业宽窄和教学内容等等问题；同时，要明确教育工作是学校的中心，教学、科学研究和生产要相辅相成，正确地结合起来。要积极组织全体师生直接参加校内外生产工作，根据培养目标和理论联系实际的教学原则，把生产工作恰如其分地组织在教学过程之内。根据以上精神，学校要有计划、有步骤地修改教学计划、教学大纲和各种教学法文件，大力提高教学质量。同时必须进一步增加工农学生，积极办好新专业和培养一支红色教师的队伍。报告最后强调指出：要掀起这次新的教育改革，关键问题是要加强党的领导和在教育、科学研究等各方面工作中贯彻群众路线。
    最后，清华大学苏联专家组长齐斯佳柯夫向大会作了“不断提高教育工作质量——苏联高等学校最重要的任务”的报告。他着重谈到教学结合生产是不断提高教学质量的一个重要方面。
    会议从7日起继续在各系和教研组中展开辩论。
