    Huzhu Tu Autonomous County, Qinghai
    Creates Large Wooden Inverted Siphon

    In water conservancy construction, Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province demonstrated originality and boldly used large wooden inverted siphons to channel water across *yáhé*, breaking through the biggest difficulty in mountainous water conservancy (a *yáhé* is a depression between two mountains).

    The sixteen main canals built by the autonomous county pass through forty-four *yáhé*, the largest of which is seven hundred meters long. The earth and stone work of the canals is nearly complete, but many *yáhé* still cut the large canals into sections. In order to rush irrigation for the seedlings, the county committee leaders went to the *yáhé* construction sites to discuss solutions with the masses.

    Some proposed using steel pipes or cement pipes for the inverted siphons. However, the autonomous county had neither steel pipes nor cement pipes. Then, someone boldly suggested using wooden pipes instead of steel pipes. The county committee affirmed this original suggestion and immediately organized trial production, which was eventually successful.

    The large wooden siphon pipes are round, with an internal diameter ranging from eight *gongcun* to one meter, and the wooden boards are about seven centimeters thick. Asphalt and hemp fiber are used to fill the seams and joints. The number of hoops depends on the water pressure at each section. Each inverted siphon has a drain hole at the bottom for drainage and frost prevention in winter. The outlet is slightly lower than the inlet; the longer the inverted siphon, the lower it is. When the first giant wooden pipe section was made, the county committee leaders immediately held a meeting of all *yáhé* construction site leaders on-site for practical observation and learning. The next day, all *yáhé* construction sites began using wood to construct inverted siphons.

    Water release tests proved that using large wooden inverted siphons to channel water across *yáhé* is a revolutionary measure in mountainous water conservancy projects. Not only did it save time, but it also saved a lot of manpower and materials. Compared with filling embankments, the county's inverted siphon project saved about 1.07 million workdays.

    青海互助土族自治县
    创大型木制倒虹管
    青海互助土族自治县在兴修水利中发挥独创精神，大胆利用大型木制倒虹管引水过牙合，突破了山区修水利中的最大难关（牙合是两山之间的凹部）。
    自治县修成的十六条干渠经过四十四个牙合，其中最大的一个有七百公尺长。渠道的土石方工程快完了，但是，许多牙合仍然使大渠段段切开。为了赶浇苗水，县委领导同志便到各个牙合工地，同群众探讨办法。
    有人提出用钢管或水泥管装倒虹管。可是自治县没有钢管或水泥管。于是有人大胆建议用木管代钢管。县委肯定了这个独创性的建议，并立即组织试制，终于成功。
    大型木虹管的形式是圆的，内部直径由八公寸到一公尺，木板厚约七公分，用沥青和麻绒塞缝、接口，根据各段水压大小决定用几道篐。每个倒虹管底部设一个排水孔，冬季好排水防冻。出水口比进水口稍低，倒虹管越长就越低一些。当第一节巨型圆木管制成后，县委领导同志马上就在现场召开全县牙合工地负责人会议，实地观摩学习。第二天，各牙合工地都开始用木材装制倒虹管。
    经过放水证明，大型木制倒虹管引水过牙合是山区水利工程上的一个革命性措施。不仅争取了时间，还省了大量人力和器材，全县的倒虹管工程同垫方相比，就省了约一百零七万个工日。
