	Sports Leap Forward: Learning from Gaotang
	Cheng Xian
	Currently, production in various regions is leaping forward in great strides. The leap forward in production is driving the leap forward in other tasks, including sports; conversely, the great leap forward in various tasks is promoting an even greater leap forward in production. Taking only the great leap forward in rural sports, its role in promoting production is very obvious. The experience of Gaotang County in Shandong Province is a good example.
	Gaotang County tightly intertwined production and sports, making sports closely serve production, forming a lively and vigorous situation of "the fields are battlefields and sports fields, working happily," which is an important and successful experience. After the peasant masses were liberated in terms of ownership and political thought, their moods improved. They are striving to be upstream in production, and therefore also urgently demand that they be strong and healthy. They demand a rich and colorful life, and therefore they love sports activities. Some people do not see this change in the mood of the masses, nor can they understand the demands of the peasant masses, thinking that in such a tense time of rural production, how can sports activities be carried out? However, the facts of Gaotang County prove that as long as it is closely combined with production and serves production, sports can be carried out vigorously. Due to the development of sports activities, the disease rate of farmers has decreased, the attendance rate has increased, and many new atmospheres have emerged in production. "The whole body grows strength," "Going to the fields like a tiger," this is the praise of the farmers in Gaotang County for the benefits of carrying out sports activities.
	Party committee leadership, the secretary taking the lead, business departments acting as consultants, relevant departments working together, solving ideological problems through debate, and vigorously mobilizing the masses, this is another important experience of Gaotang County in carrying out sports activities. Because the demands of the peasant masses are multifaceted, and the time of the peasant masses is limited, it must be uniformly arranged, and production must be the main focus, with primary and secondary placed in appropriate positions, which requires the unified leadership of the Party committee, and widely mobilizing the masses to carry out debates, so that the masses have a full and correct understanding of sports. After Gaotang County did this, sports activities throughout the county quickly and universally developed. Now every township and commune has established a sports association, with more than 41,000 people participating in sports activities, accounting for more than 40% of the county's young adults. Under the principle of relying on the masses to run sports diligently and thriftily, it has been achieved that every commune has venues, every item has equipment, and there are activities everywhere, and sports have truly become mass activities.
	The practice of Gaotang County in carrying out sports activities is very good. Let us all "learn from Gaotang, compare with Gaotang, catch up with Gaotang," and push mass sports to a new climax.

    体育跃进学高唐
    程仙
    现在，各地生产都在大踏步地向前跃进。生产的跃进，带动了其它各项工作也在跃进，体育工作也不例外；反过来，各项工作的大跃进又促进生产的更大的跃进。只就农村体育大跃进来说，它对促进生产所起的作用就很明显。山东高唐县的经验就是一个很好的例子。
    高唐县把生产和体育拧成一根绳，使体育紧密地服务于生产，形成“田间是战场，又是运动场，干起活来喜洋洋”的生龙活虎的局面，这是一项重要的、成功的经验。农民群众在所有制和政治思想上得到解放以后，心情舒畅了。他们在生产上正力争上游，因此也迫切地要求自己身强力壮。他们在生活上要求丰富多采，因此也就喜爱体育活动。有些人看不到群众心情上的这种变化，也不能理解农民群众的这一要求，认为在农村生产这样紧张的时候，怎么搞得起体育运动来？但是，高唐县的事实却证明：只要紧密地结合生产并服务于生产，体育运动是可以轰轰烈烈地搞起来的。由于体育活动的开展，农民的患病率降低了，出勤率提高了，生产上出现了许多新气象。“全身长力气”，“下地像只虎”，这就是高唐县农民对于开展体育活动的好处的赞扬。
    党委领导，书记挂帅，业务部门当参谋，有关部门一齐动手，通过辩论，解决思想问题，大力发动群众，这是高唐县开展体育活动的另一个重要经验。因为农民群众的要求是多方面的，而农民群众的时间又是有限的，必须加以统一安排，必须以生产为主，把主次放在适当的地位，这就需要党委统一领导，并广泛发动群众开展辩论，使群众对体育运动有充分的正确的认识。高唐县这样做了以后，全县的体育活动就迅速地普遍地开展起来了。现在每个乡社都建立了体育协会，有四万一千多人参加了体育活动，占全县青壮年40％以上。在依靠群众勤俭办体育的原则下，做到了社社有场地、项项有设备、处处有活动，体育已经真正成为群众性的活动了。
    高唐县开展体育活动的做法很好。让我们大家都来“学高唐、比高唐、赶高唐”，把群众性体育运动推向一个新的高潮。
