    New Flood Control Strategy
    The flood season is approaching, and some areas (such as parts of Jiangxi Province) have already experienced flooding. The broad masses of farmers are facing a new battle and a new test. The new strategy adopted by Henan Province—shifting from the past simple flood control of points and lines to a comprehensive and active offensive, intercepting and storing floodwaters on the spot and utilizing them—is another important measure to turn bad things into good things and transform negative factors into positive ones to transform nature. Other regions also need to act early, adopt a proactive and aggressive strategy, and mobilize the broad masses of farmers to attack floods and win the victory before the flood season arrives.
    Areas that have already experienced flooding need to, like Jiangxi, urgently mobilize the broad masses of farmers, organize a large flood control and rescue force, and do everything possible to take flood control and drainage measures to eliminate flooding.
    In this way, with offense as the main strategy and defense as the auxiliary, and by closely combining offense and defense, we will be confident of winning this new battle, withstanding this new test, and ensuring the victorious completion of the summer harvest and planting.

    防汛新战略
    汛期即将来到，有的地方（例如江西省部分地区）已经发生了洪涝灾情。广大农民又面临着一场新的战斗，新的考验。河南省所采取的新战略——由过去的点线的单纯防汛转为全面的积极的进攻，把洪水就地拦蓄起来，加以利用。这是变坏事为好事，化消极因素为积极因素的改造自然的又一个重要措施。其他地区也需要及早动手，采取主动的积极的战略，发动广大农民向洪汛进攻，决胜于汛期到来之前。
    已经发生洪涝灾情的地区，就需要像江西那样，紧急动员广大农民，组成防汛抢险大军，千方百计地采取防汛排涝措施，消灭洪涝。
    这样，以进攻为主，防御为辅，把进攻和防御密切地结合起来，我们就有把握赢得这场新的战斗，经得住这场新的考验，保证夏收夏种胜利完成。
