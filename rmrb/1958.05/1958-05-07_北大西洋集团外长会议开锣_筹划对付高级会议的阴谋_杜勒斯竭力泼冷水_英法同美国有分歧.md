Xinhua News Agency, Copenhagen, 6th dispatch: The foreign ministers of the fifteen North Atlantic Group countries began their scheduled three-day meeting here on the 5th.

Under the growing pressure of world public opinion demanding the convening of an East-West summit conference, the meeting is compelled by the situation to mainly discuss the issues related to convening a summit conference and the West's countermeasures. The agenda of the meeting also includes hearing a report from the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group forces, Norstad, on the plan to establish American medium-range missile bases in Western Europe.

According to United Press reporter Trell, the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Group countries will "adjust some differences in their attitudes towards the summit conference issue" at this meeting. He believes that, first, the United States and Britain have "divergent opinions on the assessment of Russia's summit conference strategy." The United States insists on a "skeptical" attitude, therefore it is "very reluctant" to participate in such a meeting, while Britain is somewhat different. France now "has no fixed opinion," obviously because the French political crisis has made it difficult for it to even take care of itself. US Secretary of State Dulles spoke twice at the opening of the meeting on the 5th, trying hard to pour cold water on the summit conference.

However, the tone of the United States' Atlantic "allies" cannot match the tone of the United States. In contrast to Dulles's attitude, British Foreign Secretary Lloyd spoke to reporters about the summit conference issue as soon as he arrived in Copenhagen. At the first day's meeting, Lloyd asked the foreign ministers to express their opinions on which countries should participate in the summit conference. Lloyd stated that Britain does not like a large number of countries participating in the summit conference, but it is revealed that Britain has not yet made a decision on the issue of reciprocity. Lloyd said at the meeting that it would be foolish for the West to break up discussions over procedural issues.

It is reported that after the first day of the meeting, it was shown that only Turkey insisted, like the United States, on the need for thorough and lengthy "preparation" on the summit conference issue.

### 北大西洋集团外长会议开锣  筹划对付高级会议的阴谋  杜勒斯竭力泼冷水　英法同美国有分歧

    北大西洋集团外长会议开锣
    筹划对付高级会议的阴谋
    杜勒斯竭力泼冷水　英法同美国有分歧
    据新华社6日讯　哥本哈根消息：北大西洋集团十五个国家的外交部长按照预定计划5日在这里开始举行三天的会议。
    在世界公众要求召开东西方最高级会议的压力不断加强的情况下，这次会议为形势所迫，主要将讨论有关召开最高级会议和西方对策的问题。会议的议程还包括听取北大西洋集团军队总司令诺斯塔德关于在西欧建立美国中程导弹基地计划的报告。
    据合众社记者特勒指出，北大西洋集团各国的外交部长们将在这次会议上“调整他们对最高级会议问题的态度上的一些分歧意见”。据他认为，首先，美英两国在对“俄国的最高级会议战略的估计上有分歧”，美国坚持“怀疑”态度，因此对于参加这样一个会议“很勉强”，而英国则有所不同。法国现在“没有什么定见”，显然这是因为法国的政治危机已经使它自身难保。美国国务卿杜勒斯在5日开幕的会议上先后发了两次言，竭力给最高级会议泼冷水。
    但是美国的大西洋“盟国”的调子并不能和美国的调子合上拍。同杜勒斯的态度相对照，英国外交大臣劳埃德一到哥本哈根，就向记者谈论了有关高级会议的问题。劳埃德在第一天的会议上要求各国外长对应该由哪些国家参加最高级会议的问题发表意见。劳埃德表示，英国并不喜欢有比较多的国家参加最高级会议，但是据透露，英国还没有就对等的问题作出决定。劳埃德在会上说，要是西方在程序问题上使讨论破裂，那将是愚蠢的。
    有消息说，在举行了第一天的会议以后，表明同美国一样坚持在高级会议问题上要有彻底而长时期的“准备”的，只有土耳其。
