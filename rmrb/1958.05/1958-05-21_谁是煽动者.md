A Note

	Who is the Instigator
	Nixon's recent visit to South America was met with strong anti-American demonstrations by the people of various South American countries. This is not accidental. But the U.S. government wants to excuse itself by saying that things were instigated by others.
	A United Press International news item on May 16 did admit to a fact, saying that the outbreak of anti-American sentiment among the South American people was due to "widespread dissatisfaction with U.S. policy, particularly trade and foreign aid policies." In fact, it is dissatisfaction with American colonial plunder. Since the United States has damaged the sovereignty and interests of South American countries, the South American people will of course rise up against the United States. It can be seen that the instigator is not someone else, but precisely the United States itself.

    谁是煽动者
    尼克松最近访问南美，遇到了南美各国人民强烈的反美示威。这并不是偶然的。但美国政府却想自我解嘲，把事情说成是别人煽动起来的。
    合众社5月16日的一条新闻倒是承认了一个事实，它说南美人民反美情绪的爆发是由于“广大的群众对美国政策的不满，特别是对贸易和外援政策的不满”。其实，也就是对于美国殖民掠夺的不满。美国既然损害了南美各国的主权和利益，南美人民当然就起来反对美国。可见煽动者并不是别人，恰恰是美国自己。
