    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 23rd: On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, General Zhang Jingwu of the Central People's Government Representative in Tibet and Secretary of the Tibet Work Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, spoke to a Xinhua News Agency reporter about the implementation of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet."
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "The implementation of the agreement over the past seven years has been good, and the achievements are remarkable."
    General Zhang Jingwu was one of the representatives of the central government who signed this agreement in Beijing on May 23, 1951. He said that the signing of the Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet was a brilliant realization of the Chinese Communist Party's and the Central People's Government's policy of national equality and unity, and the principle of peaceful liberation of Tibet. It was also a concrete manifestation of the Dalai Lama, the Panchen Erdeni, and the broad masses of the Tibetan people's opposition to imperialism and their love for the motherland. The signing of the agreement brought the Tibetan people back to the great family of unity, friendship, and cooperation of all nationalities of the motherland, completed the unification of the mainland of the motherland, and ended the long-term disunity and division within Tibet.
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "According to the 'Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,' the People's Liberation Army peacefully entered Tibet, expelled imperialist aggressor forces from Tibet, and consolidated the southwest national defense of the motherland. The central government also sent a group of staff members (most of whom are Han) to Tibet to help the Tibetan people carry out various political, economic, and cultural construction projects. Over the past seven years, the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet have faithfully implemented the agreement, exemplarily observed various policies and disciplines, and actively helped the Tibetan people build roads, bridges, open up wasteland, and produce. The Tibetan people in Tibet believe in Lamaism. The staff members and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army entering Tibet have implemented the central government's policy of freedom of religious belief, protected temples, and respected the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people. In October 1956, the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China was established, which played a certain role in guiding Tibetan Buddhists to promote patriotism, defend world peace, and implement the policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government to protect freedom of religious belief."
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "After Tibet returned to the great family of the motherland, it enjoyed the right to exercise national regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government. On April 22, 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, uniting people from all walks of life from the Tibetan local government, the Panchen Kampot会议厅委员会, and the Changdu Area People's Liberation Committee, as well as representatives from various religious sects and temples in Tibet, to handle certain internal affairs of Tibet under the leadership of the State Council, and to prepare conditions for the establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region. The establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has brought new development to the work in Tibet." He said that, based on the actual situation in Tibet, the central government has helped the local government of Tibet carry out some construction work and beneficial things to improve the people's lives. Over the past seven years, the state has allocated a large amount of funds to Tibet and started to build some small factories, farms, schools, and service enterprises.
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "Since Tibet returned to the great family of the motherland, it has ended the historical influence of imperialism in Tibet and unified foreign affairs work. Due to the central government's peaceful diplomatic policy and its firm adherence to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, new relations of peaceful and friendly coexistence have been established between China and its neighbors such as India and Nepal on a new basis. The 'Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of India on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and India,' signed on April 29, 1954, and the 'Agreement between the People's Republic of China and the Kingdom of Nepal on the Maintenance of Friendly Relations and on Trade and Intercourse between the Tibet Region of China and Nepal,' signed on September 20, 1956, have further developed friendly transportation, trade, and cultural relations between the People's Republic of China and countries such as India and Nepal on the principles of equality and mutual benefit."
    General Zhang Jingwu also mentioned that Tibet's national defense is now stronger, and the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet not only defends the borders of the motherland, but also plays a major role in uniting the Tibetan people and helping them carry out production and other work. He said that the officers of the Tibetan local troops have now been awarded military ranks by the Ministry of National Defense. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet and the Tibetan local troops are closely linked through mutual learning and mutual assistance, strengthening the unity between the troops, but it is also necessary to continue to carry out various preparatory work and strengthen patriotic education, so that they can be formally reorganized into a part of the national defense force when conditions are ripe in the future.
    When talking about how to continue to thoroughly implement the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet in the future, General Zhang Jingwu said that there are two main issues that still need to be worked on.
    "The most important thing is to enable Tibet to gradually enter socialist society through democratic reform and social reform, based on Tibet's historical conditions and social conditions. To take the socialist road, it is necessary to carry out reforms suitable for the specific situation in Tibet, based on the specific situation in Tibet. However, the conditions for reform in Tibet are not yet ripe, so the central government has decided not to carry out democratic reforms during the Second Five-Year Plan period. As for when to carry out reforms in the future, it depends on whether the conditions for reform are ripe and mature. According to the central government's established policy, peaceful consultation will be adopted for future reforms in Tibet. This task depends on the good unity and cooperation, enhanced awareness, and joint efforts of the Tibetan people, as well as public leaders and upper-class figures of the Tibetan people."
    "The second is to strive for the early establishment of a unified Tibet Autonomous Region. To this end, it is necessary to conscientiously train ethnic minority cadres, especially to strengthen the training of cadres who have grown up from the working people, accumulate work experience, and create conditions."
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "There are many problems in the economic construction of the local government of Tibet before the realization of democratic reform, but we should still try our best to do some things that are necessary, feasible, and beneficial to the Tibetan people. It is certain that after the social reform is carried out, Tibet's economic and cultural construction will develop rapidly."
    Finally, General Zhang Jingwu analyzed the current political and ideological situation in Tibet and put forward two political tasks.
    He said: "The most important enemies of the Tibetan people are imperialism and reactionaries who betray the motherland and the Tibetan people. Imperialists and counter-revolutionaries will not be reconciled to failure. They will continue to conspire to undermine the patriotic, united, and progressive cause of the Tibetan people. All the Tibetan people must always be vigilant, closely unite in the great family of the motherland, and resolutely fight against imperialist elements and a handful of reactionaries. Always be vigilant against their conspiracies to sow discord, undermine the unification of the motherland, and undermine national unity."
    General Zhang Jingwu said: "We must continue to oppose Han chauvinism, and at the same time oppose local nationalism. If the local nationalism and separatist tendencies in Tibet are allowed to develop, it will not only endanger the unification of the motherland and national unity, but also hinder the progress and development of the work in Tibet and prevent the Tibetan people from getting rid of their poverty and backwardness."
    In concluding his speech, General Zhang Jingwu said: "The main task of Tibet's future work is to continue to consolidate and expand the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, follow Chairman Mao's instructions of 'unity, progress, and greater development,' and the People's Liberation Army and staff members entering Tibet should unite more closely with the Tibetan people and strive to thoroughly implement the seventeen articles of the agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet for the motherland."

    张经武将军对新华社记者发表谈话
    执行关于和平解放西藏办法的协议情况良好成绩显著
    当前的政治任务是：坚决同帝国主义分子和一小撮反动分子进行斗争；继续反对大民族主义，同时也要反对地方民族主义。
    新华社拉萨23日电　西藏和平解放七周年前夕，中央人民政府驻西藏代表、中共西藏工委书记张经武将军就执行“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”的情况，向新华社记者发表了谈话。
    张经武将军说：“七年来执行协议的情况是良好的，成绩是显著的。”
    张经武将军是1951年5月23日在北京签订这一协议的中央方面的代表之一。他说，和平解放西藏办法协议的签订是中国共产党和中央人民政府的民族平等、团结政策和和平解放西藏的方针的光辉实现，也是达赖喇嘛、班禅额尔德尼以及西藏广大人民反对帝国主义，热爱祖国的具体表现。协议的签订，使西藏人民回到了祖国各民族团结友爱合作的大家庭，完成了祖国大陆的统一，结束了西藏内部长期不团结的分裂状态。
    张经武将军说：“根据‘关于和平解放西藏办法的协议’，人民解放军和平进入西藏，驱逐帝国主义侵略势力出西藏，巩固了祖国的西南国防。中央还派了一批工作人员（其中大部分是汉族）到西藏来帮助西藏人民进行政治、经济和文化各项建设事业。七年来，进藏人民解放军和工作人员忠实地执行了协议，模范地遵守各种政策纪律，积极帮助西藏人民修路、架桥、开荒、生产。西藏藏族人民是信奉喇嘛教的。进藏工作人员和人民解放军官兵贯彻执行了中央的宗教信仰自由政策，对寺庙是保护的，对西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯是尊重的。1956年10月，成立了中国佛教协会西藏分会，这对指导西藏佛教徒发扬爱国主义，保卫世界和平，贯彻中国共产党和中央人民政府保护宗教信仰自由的政策起到了一定的作用。”
    张经武将军说：“西藏回到祖国大家庭后，在中央人民政府的统一领导下享受了实行民族区域自治的权利。1956年4月22日已经成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，团结了西藏地方政府、班禅堪布会议厅委员会、昌都地区人民解放委员会三方面的各阶层人士，和西藏各教派、各寺庙的代表人物，在国务院的领导下，处理若干西藏的内部事务，并为成立统一的西藏自治区准备条件。西藏自治区筹备委员会的成立使西藏工作有了新的发展”。他说，根据西藏的实际情况，中央已经帮助西藏地方进行了一些建设工作和改善人民生活的有益事情。国家七年来拨给了西藏大量的经费，开始建设起了一些小型的工厂、农场、学校和服务性的企业。
    张经武将军说：“自从西藏回到祖国大家庭后，结束了历史上帝国主义在西藏遗留下来的影响，统一了外事工作。由于中央的和平外交政策及坚决不渝地执行五项原则，在新的基础上，中国和印度、尼泊尔等邻邦建立了和平友好相处的新关系。1954年4月29日签订的‘中华人民共和国和印度共和国关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定’，1956年9月20日签订的‘中华人民共和国和尼泊尔王国保持友好关系以及关于中国西藏地方和尼泊尔之间的通商和交通的协定’，更使得中华人民共和国和印度、尼泊尔等国在平等互利的原则下，进一步发展了友好的交通、贸易和文化关系。”
    张经武将军还谈到西藏的国防现在更加强了，驻藏的人民解放军不仅捍卫了祖国的边疆，并且在团结藏族人民和在帮助他们进行生产和其他工作中起了重大的作用。他说，现在西藏地方部队的军官已由国防部授予了军衔。驻藏人民解放军与西藏地方部队在互相学习、互相帮助下密切联系，加强了部队间的团结，但是还要继续进行各项准备工作，加强爱国主义教育，以便今后条件具备时正式改编成为国防武装的一部分。
    在谈到今后如何继续彻底实现和平解放西藏办法的协议时，张经武将军说主要有两个问题尚待努力。
    “首要的，是根据西藏历史条件和社会条件，使西藏经过民主改革和社会改革，逐步进入社会主义社会。要走社会主义道路就必须根据西藏的具体情况，进行适合西藏具体情况的改革。但是，现在西藏改革的条件还不具备，所以中央已决定在第二个五年计划时期内不进行民主改革。至于将来什么时候进行改革，要看改革的条件是否具备，是否成熟了。根据中央的已定政策，西藏在将来改革时是采取和平协商方法，这个任务有赖于西藏人民以及西藏人民的公众领袖、上层人士很好的团结合作，提高觉悟，共同努力来完成。”
    “其次是争取早日成立统一的西藏自治区。为此，必须认真培养民族干部，尤其是要加强培养从劳动人民中成长起来的干部，积累工作经验，创造条件。”
    张经武将军说：“对西藏地方的经济建设，在未实现民主改革以前问题很多，但对必需的，可以办到的，对西藏人民有利的事情，还是要尽力地作一些。可以肯定，在进行了社会改革以后，西藏的经济文化建设事业，必将得到迅速的发展。”
    张经武将军最后就目前西藏的政治思想形势作了分析，提出了两项政治任务。
    他说：“西藏人民最主要的敌人是帝国主义，和背叛祖国、背叛西藏人民的反动分子。帝国主义和反革命分子是不会甘心失败的。还会继续阴谋破坏西藏人民的爱国、团结、进步的事业。全西藏人民必须时时提高警惕、紧密地团结在祖国大家庭里，坚决和帝国主义分子和一小撮反动分子进行斗争。随时警惕他们挑拨离间、破坏祖国统一、破坏民族团结的阴谋活动。”
    张经武将军说：“要继续反对大民族主义，同时也要反对地方民族主义。西藏的地方民族主义和分离主义倾向，如果听其发展下去，不但会危害祖国的统一和民族团结，而且会阻碍西藏地方工作的进步和发展，使西藏人民不能摆脱贫困落后的境遇。”
    在结束他的谈话时，张经武将军说：“西藏今后的工作，主要是继续巩固与扩大反帝爱国统一战线，遵照毛主席指示的‘团结、进步、更加发展’的方针、进藏的人民解放军和工作人员，要更加紧密团结西藏人民，为彻底实现和平解放西藏办法协议十七条，为建设繁荣幸福的祖国的新西藏而努力。”
