Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 24th - A 110,000-volt high-voltage transmission line between Xi'an and Baoji is being erected in sections. The line is 206 kilometers long. Once completed, the surplus electricity in Xi'an can be sent to the emerging industrial cities along the Longhai Railway east of Baoji. At the same time, more than 21,000 kilowatts of medium-sized power generation equipment can be extracted from this power supply area and transferred to southern and northern Shaanxi to build power plants.

Construction of the 70-kilometer section from Xi'an to Xingping began in October of last year, and the section spanning the Wei River is currently being erected. Preparations for the 136-kilometer section from Xingping to Baoji are now underway, and construction can begin successively in June.

Because 80% of the Xingping to Baoji section passes through plains, the designers considered changing the double poles to single poles and changing the arrangement of the lines during the design process. This will not only ensure the safety of the line's power transmission but also reduce the need for a lightning protection wire, saving cement used for the poles and reducing the investment by one-third. The pre-fabricated single-pole concrete components have now been successfully trial-produced.

### 西安——宝鸡间架设高压输电线

    西安——宝鸡间架设高压输电线
    新华社西安24日电　西安到宝鸡间十一万伏高压输电线正在分段架设。这条线路全长二百零六公里，建成后，西安富余的电力就可以送到宝鸡以东陇海铁路沿线的新兴工业城市；同时，还可以在这个供电区内抽出共二万一千多瓩的中型发电设备，调给陕南、陕北建设电厂。
    这条线路西安到兴平段七十公里，去年10月份就开始施工，现在正在架设横跨渭河的一段。兴平到宝鸡段一百三十六公里，现在正在进行各项架线准备工作，6月份可以相继动工。
    因为兴平到宝鸡这段线路有十分之八是通过平原地区，设计人员在设计时就考虑把双杆改为单杆，改变线路的排列法，既能保证线路送电安全，又可少架一根避雷线，节约电杆所用水泥，共可节省三分之一的投资。现在单杆混凝土预制件已经试制成功。
