Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th: 500,000 people in Paris held a large-scale demonstration for four hours on the afternoon of the 28th, demonstrating their determination to defend the Republic. This demonstration was held under the call of the French Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Human Rights League, the Progressive Republican Union, the Anti-Fascist Committee, the French General Confederation of Labor, the "Workers' Force" General Confederation of Labor, the French Catholic Labor Confederation, and many other parties and organizations. Participants in the march said that this was not a partisan march, but a march to defend the Republic.

At 5:00 p.m., hundreds of thousands of people from all walks of life and belonging to various political parties and trade unions gathered densely in the Place de la Nation, waving the flags of the French Republic. In front of them was a large banner with the words "Long Live the Republic" written in bold letters. Thousands of similar signs written in red and blue could also be seen in the crowd. The Avenue de Vincennes, near the Place de la Nation, was also crowded with people.

The procession, led by pickets lined up in rows of four, began to move into the Boulevard Voltaire towards the Place de la République. Many leaders of political parties and trade union organizations walked in front of the huge banner. Among them were: Jacques Duclos, Secretary of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party; Roger Garaudy, Laurent Casanova, Vermeersch, Guyot, and Fajon, members of the Political Bureau of the French Communist Party; Pierre Commin, Deputy Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party; Deixonne, Chairman of the Parliamentary Group; Pineau, former Foreign Minister; and Gazier, the current Minister of Information; Radical Socialists Mendès-France, Daladier, and Lamartine; and Mitterrand, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Resistance Union; and Daniel Mayer, Chairman of the Human Rights League, etc. Benoît Frachon, Secretary-General of the French General Confederation of Labor, and leaders of the "Workers' Force" General Confederation of Labor and the Catholic Labor Confederation also walked at the head of the procession. The procession included workers, staff, students, professors, disabled veterans in wheelchairs, and former fascist victims wearing concentration camp striped uniforms. There were elderly people, children, and women. Representatives of some political parties, trade union organizations, and social groups, as well as many famous figures in science and the arts, also participated in the march with the people.

The procession advanced, singing the Marseillaise and the Internationale. They shouted slogans such as "United Action," "Don't Let Fascism Succeed," "Defend the Republic," and "Long Live the People's Front." Some women shouted "Long Live France," with tears streaming down their faces.

As the procession marched from the Place de la Nation to the Place de la République, delegations of workers and students continuously poured into the ranks of the demonstration. Workers in many enterprises in the capital stopped work to participate in the demonstration. On both sides of the street, Parisians cheered and applauded the procession from the balconies and windows of buildings, and sang the Marseillaise and the Internationale with them.

At 7:30, the procession began to arrive at the Place de la République. Behind the Freedom Monument in the square hung a huge banner with the words "No to De Gaulle." The procession continued to advance, and at 8:45, the last part of the procession arrived at the square. This part of the procession was a delegation of workers from the suburbs of Paris. When they arrived, the audience shouted slogans of "People's Front" and "United Action."

At the same time as the demonstration, at the busiest time of Paris traffic, employees of the subway, buses, and suburban trains also responded to the call of the trade unions and held a lightning strike.

Today's "l'Humanité" reported that in addition to the demonstration of working people in Paris yesterday, large-scale demonstrations were also held in Saint-Nazaire, Nantes, Saint-Étienne, Montpellier, and many other cities.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement pointing out that during the large-scale demonstration, the residents of Paris expressed their firm will to protect the Republic.

The Political Bureau pointed out that "May 28th once again proved that the capital firmly maintains democracy and national unity." The Political Bureau said, "Paris and other parts of the country have called for the immediate establishment of a government to safeguard the republican system."

"Libération" wrote: Yesterday's "demonstration was not only a great action to defend the Republic, but also a national unity. The Republic has shown its strength."

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 29th: The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party held a meeting on the afternoon of the 28th, presided over by Secretary-General Thorez. The meeting issued a statement on the serious political situation in France, saying that the current real issue is dictatorship and war, or republic and peace. Due to the resignation of the Pflimlin government, the danger of De Gaulle's followers has increased. It is very clear that dangerous behind-the-scenes secret negotiations are the cause of the resignation. In this case, De Gaulle's seizure of power with the help of the Algerian and Ajaccio fascist riots would mean a veritable coup. On the other hand, the people have increasingly and powerfully demonstrated their determination to maintain the republican system.

The statement said that hundreds of thousands of workers expressed their determination to defend the Republic with a powerful strike movement on May 27th, and the French Communist Party pays tribute to the workers' struggle.

The statement pointed out that the results of the National Assembly's vote on the 27th showed that De Gaulle could only obtain 165 votes in support, while 408 votes were in favor of defending the republican system. The interests of the country require the establishment of a government to defend the Republic. Only a republican government can solve the urgent problems facing France, especially the Algerian problem, on the basis of conforming to the interests of the nation and peace.

The statement emphasized that the unity of Communists and Socialists in the action to defend the Republic will promote the unity of all republican forces and make the establishment of fascist rule impossible. Therefore, the attitude of the Socialist Party is decisive for the establishment of such a government and for unitedly defending the Republic.

The statement concluded that it is now clearer than ever that excluding Communists is a fatal threat to the Republic. In the current situation, all working people and all republicans, in every factory and rural area, on every street, must fight for the realization of unity, which is extremely important for saving the Republic and the unity of France.

    法国人民团结起来坚决不让戴高乐上台
    巴黎五十万人反法西斯大示威
    法共发表声明号召保卫共和保卫和平
    新华社巴黎29日电　巴黎市五十万人民28日下午举行了历时四小时的声势浩大的示威游行，显示了他们坚决捍卫共和国的意志。这次示威游行是在法国共产党、社会党、人权联盟、进步共和联盟、抵抗法西斯委员会、法国总工会、“工人力量”总工会、法国天主教劳工联盟和其他许多党派和团体的号召下举行的。参加游行的人说，这不是一次党派的游行，而是保卫共和国的游行。
    下午五点钟，包括各界和属于各种政治党派和工会的几十万人密密层层，打着法兰西共和国国旗云集在民族广场。他们前面有一大幅标语旗，上面用粗体字写着“共和国万岁”。在人丛中还可以看到数以千计的用红字、蓝字写的同样的标语牌。在民族广场附近的文孙纳大道上，也是人山人海。
    游行队伍以手挽手排成四行的纠察队为前导，开始走进伏尔泰大街向共和广场进发。在巨幅大标语前面走着的有许多政党和工会组织的领导人。其中有：法国共产党中央委员会书记雅克·杜克洛、法共政治局委员罗歇·加罗迪、洛朗·加桑诺瓦、维美徐、居约、法戎；有法国社会党副总书记皮埃尔·戈曼、议会党团主席戴克松、前外交部长比诺，及现政府情报部长加齐埃；有激进社会党人孟戴斯—弗朗斯、达拉第和拉马第埃；还有民主社会抵抗联盟主席密特朗；人权联盟主席丹尼埃·麦耶等。走在队伍前列的还有法国总工会总书记贝诺·弗拉商及“工人力量”总工会、天主教劳工联盟的领导人。在游行的队伍里还有工人、职员、学生、教授、坐着轮椅的残废退伍军人、穿着集中营条纹囚衣的前法西斯受难者。队伍中有老年人、小孩和妇女。一些政党、工会组织和社会团体的代表以及许多著名的科学和艺术界人士也同人民一道参加了游行。
    游行队伍高唱马赛曲和国际歌前进。他们高呼“团结行动”、“不让法西斯主义得逞”、“保卫共和”、“人民阵线万岁”等口号，有些妇女高呼“法兰西万岁”，热泪横流。
    在游行队伍从民族广场走到共和国广场的途中，工人和学生的代表团不断地涌入示威的行列。首都很多企业的工人为了参加示威游行都停止了工作。在街道两旁，巴黎市民从楼房的阳台和窗口向游行队伍欢呼、鼓掌，并且和他们一齐合唱马赛曲和国际歌。
    在七点三十分时，游行队伍开始到达共和国广场。在广场的自由纪念碑背后挂着巨幅标语，上面写的是：“不要戴高乐”。游行队伍继续前进，八点四十五分时，游行队伍的最后部分到达广场。这部分队伍都是巴黎郊区的工人代表团。当他们到达时，观众高呼“人民阵线”和“一致行动”的口号。
    在示威游行的同时，正当巴黎交通最繁忙的时刻，地下铁道、公共汽车和郊区火车的员工也都响应工会的号召举行了闪电式罢工。
    今天的“人道报”报道，昨天除了在巴黎举行劳动人民的示威游行外，还在圣纳策尔、南特、圣亚田、蒙科利埃和其他许多城市举行了大规模的示威游行。
    法国共产党中央政治局发表声明指出，大规模示威游行期间，巴黎居民表示坚决保护共和国的意志。
    政治局指出，“5月28日这一天，再一次证明首都坚定地维护民主和国家统一”。政治局说，“巴黎和全国其他各地纷纷要求立即成立一个维护共和制的政府”。
    “解放报”写道：昨天的“示威游行既是保卫共和的伟大行动，也是全国的团结。共和国已显示了它的力量”。
    新华社巴黎29日电　法国共产党中央政治局28日下午在总书记多列士主持下举行会议。会议就法国的严重政治局势发表声明说，目前现实的问题是独裁与战争、还是共和与和平的问题。由于弗林姆兰政府辞职，戴高乐分子的危险已经增加。事情十分明显，具有危险性的幕后秘密谈判是引起辞职的原因。在这种情况下，戴高乐借助于阿尔及利亚和阿耶佐法西斯暴乱而掌握权力将意味着一次名副其实的政变。而另一方面，人民已经日益坚强有力地表明了维护共和体制的决心。
    声明说，几十万劳动者在5月27日以强大的罢工运动表示坚决保卫共和国，法国共产党向劳动者的这一斗争致敬。
    声明指出，国民议会27日的投票结果表明，戴高乐只能取得一百六十五票支持，而四百零八票是主张保卫共和政体的。国家的利益要求成立一个保卫共和的政府。只有一个共和政府能够解决法国所面临的迫切问题，特别是在符合民族和和平的利益的基础上解决阿尔及利亚问题。
    声明强调说，共产党人和社会党人在保卫共和的行动中的团结一致，将促进一切共和力量的团结，并且使建立法西斯统治成为不可能。因此，社会党的态度对于成立这样一个政府和团结一致保卫共和国是具有决定性意义的。
    声明最后说，现在比任何时候都更加明显，排除共产党人是对共和国的致命威胁。在目前的情况下，全体劳动人民和全体共和人士在每一个工厂和农村里，在每一条街道上，都必须为实现团结而斗争，这对于拯救共和国和法兰西的统一来说是极为重要的。
