Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 27th. In recent days, workers in various parts of Hubei have held newspaper reading sessions and symposiums to discuss the general line for socialist construction formulated at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. Under the illumination and encouragement of the general line, steelworkers have expressed their determination to continuously innovate technology and create even newer achievements. The Zhang Yuye steelmaking team of the No. 3 electric furnace in the steelmaking department of Daye Steel Plant created nine new records in April. After reading the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, they said: We must not be satisfied with the status quo, but must make steel more, faster, better, and more economically. The workers of the heating furnace group of the third shift in the rolling mill department, in accordance with the spirit of the general line, examined the problems of neglecting safe production in the past and put forward specific measures to ensure safety. After a symposium, the coal miners of the Tongkeng No. 1 district of Yuanhua Coal Mine unanimously proposed to make an all-round leap forward in coal mining efficiency, saving scattered coal, ensuring attendance, and safe production, to ensure that the entire district recovers more than five tons of scattered coal every day, and that each person mines about 1,000 to 1,200 tons of coal throughout the year. At a forum of responsible cadres from construction sites and offices held by the Wugang Mining Branch on the afternoon of the 26th, four measures were put forward to ensure that leading cadres go deep into the construction sites to do a good job of experimentation, accelerate mine construction, and ensure the early supply of ore for the No. 1 blast furnace of Wugang.

Having seen the general line for the period of socialist construction issued by the Central Committee of the Party, the workers of agricultural implement factories and workshops in various places have become more enthusiastic about supporting agricultural development, and have put forward the idea of producing agricultural implements more, faster, better, and more economically to ensure the early mechanization of agricultural production. The Hubei Provincial Agricultural Implement Factory, which is preparing to trial-produce a 27-horsepower medium-sized tractor, originally planned to successfully trial-produce the tractor on National Day this year. In order to celebrate the publication of the general line, they decided to work hard for fifty days and produce it before June 20th.

The workers of local factories and enterprises in Wuhan are also boiling with enthusiasm, and the general line has become their action slogan. The Hanyang Sleeper Anti-Corrosion Factory has learned from its past experience that: whenever the enterprise is managed in accordance with the principles of the general line, production develops greatly, and when it deviates from the general line, problems arise in production. The workers said that they are now clearer and more determined about the direction of developing production. The factory has recently put forward the fighting goal of "doubling profits, quadrupling quality, and increasing sleeper production by 400,000", striving to catch up with Britain in sleeper anti-corrosion quality in two years.

    不断革新技术创造更大成就
    湖北广大职工表示贯彻总路线的决心
    新华社武汉27日电　湖北各地工人连日来，纷纷举行读报会、座谈会，讨论八大二次会议制定的社会主义建设总路线。在总路线的照耀和鼓舞下，钢铁工人表示决心不断革新技术，创造更新的成就。大冶钢厂炼钢部三号电炉张玉业炼钢班，4月份曾创造九次新纪录。他们从报上看到中共八大二次会议闭幕的消息后说：我们决不能满足现状，要把钢铁炼得又多又快又好又省。轧钢部第三班加热炉小组工人，根据总路线的精神检查了过去忽视安全生产的问题，提出了保证安全的具体措施。源华煤矿桐坑一区的采煤工人在座谈后，一致提出要在采煤效率、节约散煤、保证出勤率、安全生产等方面来一个全面大跃进，保证全区每天收回散煤五吨以上，每人全年要采煤一千到一千二百吨左右。武钢矿山分公司在26日下午召开的工地、科室负责干部座谈会上，提出四项措施，保证领导干部深入工地搞好试验，加速矿山建设，保证提前供应武钢一号高炉的矿石。
    各地农具制造厂、坊的工人，看到党中央发布的社会主义建设时期的总路线以后，更增加了支援农业发展的积极性，纷纷提出多快好省地生产农具、保证农业生产提早机械化。准备试制二十七马力中型拖拉机的湖北省农具厂，原计划在今年国庆节把拖拉机试制成功，为了庆祝总路线的发布，他们决定苦战五十天，提前在6月20日以前制造出来。
    武汉市地方工厂企业的职工，也都沸腾起来了，总路线成了他们的行动口号，汉阳枕木防腐厂从自己过去的经验中体会到：每当按总路线的原则管理企业时，生产就大发展，离开总路线生产就出问题，工人们说，现在他们对发展生产的方向更加明确，更加坚定了。这个厂最近已提出“利润翻一翻，质量翻四翻，枕木增产四十万”的奋斗目标，争取两年在枕木防腐质量上赶上英国。
