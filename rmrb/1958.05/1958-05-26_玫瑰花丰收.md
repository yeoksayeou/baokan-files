    Rose Harvest
    Rose flowers are abundant in the mountainous areas of the Jingxi Mining Area and Changping District in Beijing. Jiangou Village in the Jingxi Mining Area is a major rose-producing area. The rose flowers here are as big as half a fist, with thick petals and a particularly strong fragrance. It is estimated that more than 20,000 jin can be picked, an increase of 67% compared to the 1956 output, accounting for more than 30% of the total income of the commune members. (Yu Xingyuan)

    玫瑰花丰收
    在北京京西矿区和昌平区的山地，盛产玫瑰花。京西矿区涧沟村是玫瑰花的大产地，这里的玫瑰花，一朵就有半个拳头大，花瓣很厚，香味特别浓烈。估计能采摘二万多斤，比1956年产量将增加67％，约占社员总收入的30％多。（于星垣）
