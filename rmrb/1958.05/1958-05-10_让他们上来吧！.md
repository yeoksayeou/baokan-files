Gratitude to the People's Liberation Army; Learning from the People's Liberation Army

    "Let them come up!"
    One day during the winter vacation, I was in Shanghai taking the No. 41 bus to Dapu Bridge. Five People's Liberation Army comrades boarded the bus at the same stop as me, one of whom was a second lieutenant.
    The weather was gloomy that day, and as soon as the bus reached the Hengfeng Road Three-Story Building stop, it began to drizzle. More than twenty passengers were waiting at the station. To prevent passengers from getting rained on, the conductor tried to squeeze everyone on. Unfortunately, there were still four passengers who couldn't squeeze on, including an old grandmother and a woman holding a baby.
    The conductor greeted them and was about to close the door when the second lieutenant standing next to me said to the other four comrades, "Let's get off and walk, let them come up." After saying that, they all jumped off the bus.
    At this moment, a murmur of praise and admiration arose in the bus. As the bus left the station, the passengers crowded at the windows, and through the rain-blurred windows, they saw them marching in step behind the bus, their faces showing satisfied smiles. At this time, I thought with shame: Why didn't I get off the bus?
    I must learn from the noble qualities of the People's Liberation Army comrades. Suzhou Yang Gusheng (with picture)

### “让他们上来吧！”

专栏：感谢解放军  学习解放军

    “让他们上来吧！”
    寒假里有一天，我在上海乘四十一路公共汽车到打浦桥去，和我同站上车的有五个解放军同志，其中一位是少尉军官。
    那天天气很阴沉，汽车刚到恒丰路三层楼站，就下起霏霏细雨来了。车站上排着二十多个乘客，为了不使乘客受雨淋，售票员尽量让大家往上挤，遗憾的是下面还有四位乘客实在挤不上来了。其中有个老奶奶和一个抱婴儿的妇人。
    售票员向他们打打招呼，正要关门时，立在我旁边的少尉同志对另外四个同志说：“我们下车走走，让他们上来吧。”说完都跳下车去了。
    这时，车子里发出一阵赞扬和敬佩的低语声。当汽车离开车站时，乘客们挤在窗口，从被雨水淋得模模糊糊的窗子里，看见他们正以行军步伐，在车后大步走着，脸上露着满意的笑容。这时，我惭愧地想：我为什么不下车呢？
    我一定要向解放军同志的高贵品质学习。　苏州　杨谷生（附图片）
