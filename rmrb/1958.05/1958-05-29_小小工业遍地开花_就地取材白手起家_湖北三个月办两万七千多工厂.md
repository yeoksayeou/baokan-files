Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th: Under the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, Hubei Province's local industry is experiencing a new leap forward. In the past three months or so, 27,806 small and very small factories have been built, with an average of more than 200 factories going into production every day.

At the end of February this year, when the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an on-site meeting in Huangshi City to study local industrial planning, it put forward the policy of "the masses running enterprises, and running enterprises diligently and thriftily." After this, while organizing large-scale industries to support local industries, the Provincial Committee further proposed the slogan "Small-scale industries blooming everywhere; using local materials and starting from scratch." First, based on the needs of agricultural production and people's lives, small and very small industries were universally developed, implementing the principle of combining large, medium, and small-scale industries from small to large and from indigenous to modern methods. Local industry throughout the province sprang up like mushrooms after a rain, quickly forming a mass movement of the entire Party and all the people running industry.

The newly established small factories are closely integrated with the needs of local industrial and agricultural production. According to the needs of a large number of agricultural tools for the expanded cultivation and irrigation area, and the inability of the handicraft industry in nearby market towns to meet this demand, the masses in Lao Guan Township, Nanzhang County, voluntarily vacated houses, raised funds, found materials, and contributed technology, setting up 56 factories in a simple and crude way. When carrying out water conservancy, these factories sent workers to help households produce carts; when accumulating fertilizer, they manufactured hand-operated pulleys to replace manual labor for transporting fertilizer; and currently, during the wheat harvest and rice transplanting, they are producing a large number of waterwheels and agricultural tools for agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, they are very popular among the masses.

After a large number of small factories were established, the view of "industrial mystery" was effectively broken. When Zhanxin Township in Yidu County initially studied the establishment of a hydraulic automatic combined processing plant, some people thought, "It took three years for the landlords to build a paper mill in the past, how can we build an automatic combined processing plant?" But the township branch relied on the strength of the masses and built a hydraulic automatic combined processing plant with eight kinds of tools in more than a month. (Photo attached)

In order to speed up the completion of this urgent task, the workers collectively researched and made special tools for planing ploughshare iron tires, and the efficiency was increased by more than double.

### 小小工业遍地开花　就地取材白手起家  湖北三个月办两万七千多工厂

    小小工业遍地开花　就地取材白手起家
    湖北三个月办两万七千多工厂
    新华社武汉28日电　在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，湖北省地方工业出现飞跃发展的新局面，三个来月建成了小型和小小型工厂二万七千八百零六个，平均每天有二百多个工厂投入生产。
    今年2月下旬，中共湖北省委在黄石市召开现场会议研究地方工业规划的时候，就提出“群众办企业，勤俭办企业”的方针。在此以后，省委在组织大型工业支援地方工业的同时，又进一步提出“小小工业，遍地开花；就地取材，白手起家”的口号，首先根据农业生产和人民生活的需要，普遍发展小型和小小型的工业，从小到大、从土到洋地贯彻大、中、小型工业相结合的方针。全省地方工业就如雨后春笋般生长起来，很快就形成了全党、全民办工业的群众运动。
    新办的小型工厂都同当地工农业生产的需要结合得很密切。南漳县老官乡的群众根据耕作和灌溉面积扩大后需要大量农具，而附近集镇的手工业又无法满足的情况，自动腾房、集资、找材料和献技术，因陋就简地办起了五十六个工厂。这些工厂在搞水利时，就派工人下户帮助生产车子；积肥时，就制造手摇滑车，代替人力运输肥料；在目前麦收和插秧中，他们又为农业社生产出大批水车和农具。因此深受群众欢迎。
    大批小型工厂办起来以后，有效地打破了“工业神秘”的观点。宜都县崭新乡最初研究兴办水力自动联合加工厂时，有的人认为“过去地主办个纸厂都花了三年时间，怎么能办成自动联合加工厂？”但乡支部依靠群众力量，一个多月就把一座有八种工具的水力自动联合加工厂建成。（附图片）
