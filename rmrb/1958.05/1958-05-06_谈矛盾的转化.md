    On the Transformation of Contradictions
    Pi Zhi
    Advanced and backward are opposing extremes. Under certain conditions, the advanced can transform into the backward, and the backward can transform into the advanced. In the Great Leap Forward, the mutual transformation of advanced and backward is even more obvious and universal. In the past, Tianshi Township in Hubei Province had been backward in production for eight consecutive years. In this Great Leap Forward, due to a serious change in leadership thinking and style, and the full mobilization of the masses, it leaped to become an advanced township in Xuanen County. Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, in the rectification movement, after the discussion of "For Whom to Labor," and inspired by the national Great Leap Forward, many backward workers leaped to become advanced workers. Similar examples exist everywhere. The transformation of contradictions is the objective law of the development of things. Everything has a positive and a negative side, both good and bad possibilities. Under certain conditions, positive and negative things can transform into each other, and good and bad things can also transform into each other. The issue of the transformation of contradictions is the issue of the struggle and identity of contradictions. Chairman Mao said in "On Contradiction": "All contradictory things are interconnected; not only do they coexist in a unity under certain conditions, but also, under certain conditions, they transform themselves into each other -- this is the full meaning of the identity of contradictions." Due to the identity of contradictions, the transformation of contradictions becomes possible; due to the struggle of contradictions, the transformation of contradictions can be realized. Here, conditions are very important. Without certain conditions, the transformation of contradictions cannot occur, because without certain conditions, there can be no identity and struggle of contradictions, and no leap from one extreme of the contradiction to the other. This shows that as long as the conditions are thoroughly changed, the nature of the contradiction will also change. Raising political awareness and boosting revolutionary enthusiasm are the decisive conditions for transforming backwardness into advancement; arrogance and slackness are the decisive conditions for transforming advancement into backwardness. Learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced are the best ways to promote the transformation of backwardness into advancement. This method has great mass character and combat effectiveness, and is full of revolutionary collectivism and competitive spirit; it can not only promote the leaping development of all work, but also prevent people from developing arrogant emotions and slack phenomena.
    There is no insurmountable gap between right and wrong, and there is also struggle and transformation between right and wrong. Without right, there is no wrong; without wrong, there will be no right. Only by constantly fighting against mistakes can we be tempered and be in a correct or relatively correct position. Neither right nor wrong is fixed. They are formed under certain conditions. Therefore, if the conditions change, right may become wrong, and wrong may become right. Because things are constantly developing and changing, people's views and practices must also change accordingly; otherwise, they will fall behind and make mistakes. The so-called right means being able to act in accordance with the laws and circumstances of things, that is, the subjective understanding is consistent with the objective situation; the so-called wrong is just the opposite. To make subjective understanding consistent with the objective situation, an attitude of humbly observing the situation is necessary. Therefore, Chairman Mao taught us: "Modesty helps one to make progress, whereas conceit makes one lag behind. We should always remember this truth." Conscientiously carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and striving to improve the level of Marxism-Leninism are the decisive conditions for transforming error into correctness. At present, our country is in a new period of drastic and great change, and is undergoing nationwide rectification, which is a great opportunity for training; we must consciously destroy the old and establish the new on a large scale, and eliminate capitalism and promote socialism ideologically. All mistakes and shortcomings can be transformed, the question is whether we have the awareness and determination.
    We are revolutionary optimists, not afraid of any difficulties, and we have the courage and confidence to overcome all difficulties. This is not only because the great ideal gives us great strength, but also because we are dialectical materialists and believe that contradictions can be transformed. In our view, the occurrence of difficulties and the overcoming of difficulties have an identity. The question is whether we dare to fight against difficulties and whether we strive to create conditions for the transformation of difficulties. As long as we dare to fight and are willing to work hard, we will transform difficult conditions into favorable conditions. In the movement to eliminate the "Four Pests", many leading "Four Withouts" models often appeared in places where sanitary conditions were particularly difficult (such as Chengqi Village in Fujian, Chengjiayao Village in Shandong, and Jinhua Street in Guangzhou, etc.). At first glance, this seems to be an incomprehensible strange thing, but in fact, this is in line with materialist dialectics. Because their original sanitary conditions were particularly difficult, they suffered greatly and suffered great disasters. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, once they became aware, they would be particularly tenacious in changing their situation and gloriously walked in the forefront. The front and the back are opposing extremes, and as long as the conditions are met, the two will transform each other. Blind optimists do not look at problems dialectically, but metaphysically; they do not understand the dialectical principle of the transformation of contradictions, and do not understand under what conditions contradictions can be transformed; they are unwilling to work hard in a down-to-earth manner. Therefore, due to blind optimism, they are not good at using favorable conditions, and sometimes even favorable conditions will become difficult conditions. Lenin pointed out sharply in "From the Destruction of the Old System to the Creation of the New": "Anyone who is afraid of the difficulties of socialist construction... is not a socialist." He also emphasized that the proletariat must have the spirit of "trying and correcting a thousand times and a thousand times, and never failing to achieve the goal." This spirit is a guarantee of the proletariat's certain victory and is worthy of our deep consideration and remembrance. Strengthening the training of this spirit advocated by Lenin is the decisive condition for overcoming all difficulties.
    The transformation of contradictions is diverse. From a broad perspective, there are only two types: one is to transform towards promoting, and the other is to transform towards hindering. The responsibility of us revolutionaries is to promote rather than hinder. Therefore, we must be good at striving for the transformation towards promoting according to the law of transformation of contradictions, and avoid the transformation towards hindering. To do this, we must strive to study materialist dialectics, conscientiously overcome metaphysical erroneous thoughts, and prevent directional errors in our work, so that we can truly achieve what Chairman Mao taught us: "Promote the transformation of things and achieve the goal of revolution."

    谈矛盾的转化
    丕之
    先进和落后是对立的两极，在一定条件下，先进可以转化为落后，落后也可以转化为先进。在大跃进中，先进和落后的互相转化，表现得更加明显和普遍。湖北天狮乡过去在生产上一连落后了八年，在这次大跃进中，由于认真转变了领导思想和作风，充分发动了群众，便一跃而为宣恩县的先进乡。长辛店机车车辆修理厂，在整风运动中，经过“为谁劳动”的讨论，再加上受到全国大跃进的鼓舞，许多落后工人一跃而为先进工人。类似的事例，各地都有。矛盾的转化是事物发展的客观规律。任何事物都有正面和反面，都有好和坏两种可能。在一定的条件下，正面的东西和反面的东西可以互相转化，好事和坏事也可以互相转化。矛盾的转化的问题就是矛盾的斗争性和同一性的问题。毛主席在“矛盾论”中说：“一切矛盾着的东西，互相联系着，不但在一定条件之下共处于一个统一体中，而且在一定条件之下互相转化，这就是矛盾的同一性的全部意义。”由于矛盾的同一性，矛盾的转化有了可能；由于矛盾的斗争性，矛盾的转化得以实现。在这里，条件是很重要的。离开了一定的条件，就不可能发生矛盾的转化，因为离开了一定的条件，就不可能有矛盾的同一性和斗争性，就不可能由矛盾的一极飞跃到另一极。这说明只要条件彻底变化了，矛盾的性质也就跟着变化。提高政治觉悟，鼓足革命干劲，是变落后为先进的决定条件；骄傲和松懈，是先进变为落后的决定条件。学先进，比先进，赶先进，是促使落后转化为先进的最好的方法。这一方法具有极大的群众性和战斗性，充满了革命的集体主义和竞赛精神；它既能推动一切工作飞跃发展，又能防止人们发生骄傲情绪和松懈现象。
    正确和错误之间是没有一道不可越过的鸿沟的，正确和错误之间也是有斗争、有转化的。没有正确，就没有错误；没有错误，也不会有正确。只有不断和错误作斗争，才能得到锻炼，处于正确或比较正确的地位。正确和错误都不是固定不变的。它们都是在一定条件下形成的，因此，条件变了，正确就可能变为错误，错误也可能变为正确。由于事物是不断地发展和变化的，所以人们的看法和做法也必须随着有所变化，否则，就会落后，就会犯错误。所谓正确，就是能够按照事物的规律和情况办事，即主观认识和客观情况一致；所谓错误，则恰恰相反。要想使主观认识和客观情况一致，没有虚心体察情况的态度是不行的，所以毛主席教导我们说：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”认真地进行批评和自我批评，努力提高马克思列宁主义水平，是变错误为正确的决定条件。目前我们国家正处在一个新的剧烈的伟大变革时期，并且正在进行全民整风，这是一个大好锻炼的时机；我们一定要自觉地大破大立，从思想上灭资兴无。一切错误和缺点都是可以转化的，问题在于我们是否有觉悟，是否有决心。
    我们是革命的乐观主义者，不害怕任何困难，我们有勇气有信心来克服一切困难。这不仅是由于伟大的理想赋予我们伟大的力量，并且是由于我们是辩证唯物主义者，相信矛盾是可以转化的。在我们看来，困难的发生和困难的克服是存在同一性的，问题在于我们是否敢于和困难作斗争，是否努力创造使困难转化的条件。只要我们敢于斗争，肯于努力，就会把困难条件转化为有利条件。在除“四害”运动中，许多走在前头的“四无”模范，往往出现在原先的卫生条件特别困难的地方（例如福建的澄歧村、山东的程家峧村、广州的金花街等等）。乍听起来，这似乎是不可理解的怪事，其实，这是合乎唯物辩证法的。因为他们原先的卫生条件特别困难，大吃其苦，大遭其殃，所以他们在党的领导下，一旦觉悟过来，便会特别顽强地来改变他们的处境，而光荣地走在前头了。前头和后头是对立的两极，只要条件具备，二者便互相转化。盲目的乐观主义者，不是辩证地看问题，而是形而上学地看问题；他们不懂得矛盾转化的辩证道理，不懂得矛盾在什么条件下才能转化；他们不肯脚踏实地地努力。因此，他们由于盲目乐观，不善于运用有利条件，有时连有利条件也会变成困难条件。列宁在“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”里曾经尖锐地指出：“谁若是害怕社会主义建设的困难，……那他就不是社会主义者。”并且强调无产阶级要有“善于千百次来尝试和千百次来加以改正，无论如何非达到目的不可”的精神，而这种精神是无产阶级一定胜利的保证，是值得我们深思和牢记的。加强列宁所提倡的这种精神的锻炼，就是战胜一切困难的决定条件。
    矛盾的转化是多种多样的，从大的方面来看，不外乎两种，一种是向促进方面转化，一种是向促退方面转化。我们革命者的责任，是促进而不是促退，因此，我们要善于根据矛盾的转化法则，有意识地争取向促进方面的转化，避免向促退方面的转化。为了做到这一点，就必须努力学习唯物辩证法，认真克服形而上学的错误思想，不使自己的工作发生方向性的错误，这样才能真正做到毛主席所教导我们的：“促成事物的转化，达到革命的目的。”（“矛盾论”）
