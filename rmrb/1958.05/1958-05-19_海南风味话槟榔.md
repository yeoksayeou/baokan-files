Talking About Betel Nut with Hainan Flavor
　　Jǐng Fēng

　　Betel nut is a tropical product belonging to the palm family. The trunk is slender and straight, three or four zhang high (approximately 10-13 meters), somewhat like a coconut tree, without branches, with feathery compound leaves clustered at the top, the leaves reaching two chi (approximately 67 cm) in length, and the fruit is the betel nut. In China, Taiwan, Hainan Island, and Guangdong in the south all produce betel nut. In Nanyang (Southeast Asia), there is a place in Singapore that is named Penang Island because it is rich in betel nut. The origin of the name "betel nut" itself is very interesting. According to Li Shizhen, a great medical scientist of the Ming Dynasty in China: "Both 'bin' and 'lang' are terms for honored guests. 'Records of Southern Plants' says that when people in Guangdong and Guangxi treat distinguished guests, they always present this fruit first. Therefore, the name betel nut probably comes from this." In some places in southern China, betel nut is a common fruit kept at home; shops selling betel nut are everywhere on the streets, and the shop entrances always have the four characters "Hainan Flavor."

　　There are many types of betel nut, mostly named according to their shape, such as jujube betel nut, chicken heart betel nut, pointed betel nut... But there is one called horse betel nut (or purple betel nut) that is not a true betel nut. Its shape resembles a grape, it is purple in color, and has a sweet taste. It is a medicine for treating difficult labor and malignant sores.

　　In the past, almost everyone in the South chewed betel nut. The main purpose of chewing betel nut was to prevent and treat malaria. However, betel nut is a hot-natured medicine, which is not very suitable for people in tropical climates. Moreover, anti-malarial drugs have now greatly developed, and malaria in the South has been greatly reduced, so few people constantly chew betel nut to prevent malaria. The habit of using betel nut as a substitute for tea has also been greatly reduced. Only in relatively cool places in the South (such as some places in Hunan), do people still maintain the habit of chewing betel nut. I remember the first time I tasted betel nut there, I felt flushed, dizzy, my heart was racing, and I was sweating. It turns out that the arecoline contained in betel nut has an effect on the human nervous system. However, chewing betel nut regularly can help digestion because it can increase the secretion of saliva and other digestive juices. But betel nut contains tannic acid, and excessive chewing is also harmful. The outer skin of the betel nut is a shell made of coarse fibers, which is called "da fu pi" (Areca Peel) in medicine, and can promote qi circulation, promote water metabolism, and facilitate urination. The betel nut meat has patterns and is an important medicine for killing tapeworms. Tao Hongjing of the Liang Dynasty wrote in "Miscellaneous Records of Famous Physicians" that it can "kill tapeworms," which has been proven by modern science. If betel nut is used alone to treat tapeworms, the success rate is about 90%; if it can be used in conjunction with pumpkin seeds, the success rate is almost 100%. Here, I will introduce the method of using pumpkin seeds and betel nut to treat tapeworms, as the ending of this article:

　　Grind two to four liang (approximately 100-200 grams) of pumpkin seeds with the skin (that is, white melon seeds, both raw and cooked are acceptable) into powder, and take it with warm water on an empty stomach in the morning. Two hours later, drink a small bowl of decoction made from two to three liang (approximately 100-150 grams) of betel nut. In a few hours, the worms will obediently come down.

### 海南风味话槟榔

　　海南风味话槟榔
　　景峰
    槟榔是一种热带产物，属棕榈科。树干细直，高三、四丈，有点像椰子树，不分枝，顶部丛生羽状复叶，叶长达二尺，果实就是槟榔。我国南方的台湾、海南岛、广东，都产槟榔。南洋新加坡有一个地方因为盛产槟榔而得了个槟榔屿的名称。槟榔本身这个名字的来源很有趣，据我国明代大医学家李时珍说：“宾与郎皆贵客之称，南方草木状言交广人凡贵胜族客，必先呈此果，则槟榔名义，盖取于此。”我国南方有些地方的人家，槟榔是家中常备果品；街上出售槟榔的铺子，到处都是，铺门口总有四个大字“海南风味”。
    槟榔的种类很多，大都按照形状命名，如枣儿槟榔、鸡心槟榔、尖槟榔……。但有一种叫马槟榔（或紫槟榔）的，却不是真槟榔。它的形状像葡萄，紫颜色，味道甜，是治难产和恶疮的药。
    过去南方人几乎人人都吃槟榔，口不停嚼。原来嚼槟榔的主要目的是防治疟疾。但是槟榔是一种热性药，热带气候的人服用不太相宜。况且防疟药现在已大有发展，而南方疟疾却已大为减少，所以很少有人不停地嚼槟榔来防疟疾了。至于用槟榔来代茶喝的习惯，现在也已经大大减少了。只是在南方比较温凉的地方（如湖南有些地方），人们依然保持着嚼槟榔的习惯。记得我在那里初尝槟榔的感觉，是脸红头晕，心跳出汗。原来槟榔里面含的膺鹼，对人体的神经系统是有作用的。不过，常嚼槟榔却可以帮助消化，因为槟榔能增进唾液及其他消化液的分泌。但槟榔含有鞣酸，过多嚼食也有害。槟榔的外皮，是粗纤维裹成的壳，药用叫大腹皮，可以行气、行水、利小便。槟榔肉带花纹，是杀绦虫的要药。梁代陶宏景写的“名医别录”就说过它可以“杀寸白虫”，这点已为现代科学所证明了。如果单独用槟榔治绦虫，成功率是90％左右；如果能配合南瓜子治疗，成功率几乎是百分之百。这里就来介绍一下南瓜子和槟榔治绦虫的法子，作为这篇文章的结尾：
    把二到四两带皮南瓜子（就是白瓜子，生熟都可以）压成粉，早晨空肚子用开水送下。两小时后，喝一小碗用二到三两槟榔熬成的汤药。不出几小时，虫子就服服贴贴的下来了。
