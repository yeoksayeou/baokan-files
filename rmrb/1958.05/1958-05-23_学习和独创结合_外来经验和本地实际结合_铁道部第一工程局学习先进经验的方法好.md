The First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways has combined learning from others' advanced experiences with developing its own creativity, enabling dozens of important advanced experiences from the Soviet Union and domestic fraternal units to adapt to local conditions and quickly take root and blossom in the vast construction sites.

In recent years, when learning each advanced experience, this engineering bureau has always gone through a "digestion" process, that is, first conducting research and experiments on-site or in the laboratory to combine others' experiences with their own experiences and specific conditions. After widespread promotion, they continuously improve and enhance it. The result of this creative learning has added icing to the cake to some of the original advanced experiences, with great results. For example, according to the Soviet experience of mechanized track laying, an electric track-laying machine should be used. The First Engineering Bureau did not have this equipment, so they modified the old track-laying machine without power, and then used a tractor as power to replace the electric track-laying machine, which was very convenient to use. The degree of mechanization of the rail section prefabrication factory was also lower than that of the Soviet Union, so they created a method of using small flat cars as mobile workbenches to replace the fixed work in the Soviet experience, so that the work efficiency reached the Soviet level. In learning from the Soviet experience of mechanized road construction, they also creatively adopted a large number of self-made small flat cars, grub hoes, and other improved machines to cooperate with bulldozers, automatic dump trucks, mountain openers, and soil excavators to carry out mechanized construction, making up for the lack of power machines, and setting a good example of combining modern machinery with improved tools for construction. The Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway enters the Gobi Desert west of Wuwei. The route is long, the population along the line is sparse, and materials are scarce. If too much labor is gathered, it will bring great difficulties to the supply of living materials. The First Engineering Bureau decided to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet bridge factory construction, and assembled concrete prefabricated products into hundreds of bridges along the line, and then transported them to the site for installation. Judging solely from the cost calculation of bridge factory construction, although it is higher than pouring concrete on-site, the construction period is shortened, the manpower is reduced, and the difficulties in the supply of living materials are greatly reduced. From the perspective of the entire project, it still meets the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

The First Engineering Bureau also creatively learns from the experiences created by various fraternal units in China. In 1953, the First Engineering Bureau implemented small-scale mechanized construction during the winter construction of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway. Later, when the Baoji-Chengdu Railway construction unit promoted this experience, it created equipment such as linkage tamping machines. The First Engineering Bureau sent deputy chief engineers and others to study, and made a linkage tamping machine to conduct on-site experiments, organizing workers to observe and offer opinions. Based on on-site experiments and mass opinions, the Engineering Bureau changed the linkage tamping machine into a self-dropping hammer type combined tamping machine, so that the efficiency was further improved.

    外来经验和本地实际结合
    铁道部第一工程局学习先进经验的方法好
    本报兰州22日电　铁道部第一工程局把学习别人的先进经验和发挥自己创造性结合起来，使数十种来自苏联和国内兄弟单位的重要先进经验，能够适应当地具体条件，在广大工地迅速生根开花。
    几年来，这个工程局学习每一项先进经验的时候，总要经过一道“消化”手续，即先在现场或实验室研究试验，把别人的经验和自己的经验和具体条件结合起来。在普遍推广以后，还要随时改进和提高。这样创造性地学习的结果，给原来的一些先进经验锦上添了花，效果很大。例如，按照苏联机械铺轨的经验，要使用电动铺轨机铺轨，第一工程局没有这个设备，他们就把没有动力的旧铺轨机加以改装，然后用拖拉机作动力，来代替电动铺轨机，使用非常方便。轨节预制工厂的机械化程度也较苏联为低，他们便创造了用小平车做流动工作台来代替苏联经验中的固定工作，使工作效率达到了苏联的水平。在学习苏联机械化筑路经验中，他们也创造性地采用了大量自制的小平车、扒干等改良机具，配合推土机、自动翻斗车、开山机、捞土机展开机械化施工，弥补了动力机器的不足，树立了现代化机械和改良工具相结合施工的良好榜样。兰新铁路从武威以西进入戈壁滩，路线漫长，沿线人烟稀少，物资缺乏，如果结集过多的劳动力，就会给生活供应带来很大的困难。第一工程局决定学习苏联桥梁工厂施工的先进经验，将混凝土预制成品在沿线拼装成数百座桥梁，然后运到现场安装。单从桥梁工厂施工的造价计算，虽然要比就地浇灌混凝土高一些，但是工期却缩短了，人力减少了，生活供应上的困难也大大减少了。从整个工程来看，仍然达到了多、快、好、省的要求。
    对于国内各兄弟单位创造的经验，第一工程局也是创造性学习。1953年第一工程局在兰新铁路冬季施工中，实行小型机械化施工，后来宝成铁路施工单位推广这个经验时，又创造了联动打夯机等机具，第一工程局就派副总工程师等去学习，并做了一台联动打夯机到现场实地试验，组织工人观摩和提意见。工程局根据实地试验和群众意见，把联动打夯机改为自落锤式的联合打夯机，使效率再提高一步。
