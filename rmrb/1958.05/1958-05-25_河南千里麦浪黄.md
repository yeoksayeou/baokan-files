    Henan: A Thousand Li of Golden Wheat Waves

    This year, the more than 70 million mu of wheat in Henan Province are generally growing well, surpassing any year in history. Elderly people, seeing the abundant ears of wheat, are often too excited to speak. They are witnesses to history. They have experienced countless wheat harvests over the decades, but no year can compare to this year. People clearly remember that last year the people of Henan Province worked hard to combat drought and rush-plant wheat in a situation where it didn't rain for a hundred days. The people who marched towards nature, with revolutionary heroism, worked hard throughout the winter and did a great job in the spring, and finally achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest.

    In the days when the harvest is coming, the reporter visited the Guanhutun Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Zhengzhou. The members are happily and busily preparing for the great wheat harvest, and the cooperative cadres are conducting wheat inspections and evaluations. According to their preliminary assessment, the cooperative has more than 400 mu of land yielding 1,000 jin per mu, and the average yield per mu for the entire cooperative is at least 700 jin, and they can strive to reach 850 jin. These are exciting figures, but they are not entirely satisfied with these numbers, because through this inspection and evaluation, they feel that some wheat fields have not been managed well enough. Based on this year's situation, they plan to strive to become a "1,000-jin-per-mu cooperative" next year. (Attached image)

    "This year's wheat is much taller than last year's, Uncle! Look..."

     Cooperative Director Liu Shouchong and members of the inspection and evaluation team came to the wheat field to conduct inspection and evaluation. Everyone believes that the yield per mu of this wheat field will reach 1,000 jin without any problems.

    河南千里麦浪黄
    今年河南省七千多万亩小麦普遍生长良好，是历史上任何一年都比不上的。老年人看到那丰硕的麦穗，往往会激动得说不出话来。他们是历史的见证人，几十年来也曾有过无数次的小麦丰收，可是那一年能比今年。人们都清楚地记得，去年河南省广大人民是在百日不雨的情况下抗旱抢种上小麦的。向大自然进军的人们，以革命的英雄气概，苦干一冬，大干一春，终于获得空前丰收。
    在丰收即将来临的日子，记者访问了郑州郊区关虎屯农业社，社员们正在欢心鼓舞的为迎接小麦大丰收而紧张地忙碌着，社干部正在进行小麦检查评比。根据他们初步鉴定，社里出现四百多亩千斤亩，全社平均亩产起码是七百斤，可以争取达到八百五十斤。这是多么令人兴奋的数字啊，可是他们对这个数字还不太满意，因为通过这次检查评比，他们感到有些麦田管理的还不够好。根据今年的情况，他们准备争取在明年成为小麦千斤社。（附图片）
    七十四岁的老农、社劳动模范鲍有德（左）说：“人活七十古来稀，能看到这样的小麦就更稀奇了”。
    “今年的麦子比去年高多哩，叔叔！你看……”。
     社长刘守忠和检查评比小组的成员来到麦田进行检查评比。大家认为这片小麦亩产量达到一千斤没有问题。
