    Rural Areas Need Newsreels
    The films seen in rural areas now are mostly feature films, and very few newsreels and science education films reflecting the new face of the countryside and major events at home and abroad are shown. The documentary shorts "Liu Jimei Forgets His Roots and Turns Back" and "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind" that were shown some time ago were very popular with the farmers, and they received a great education from them. When some farmers saw Chairman Mao in the movie, they shouted loudly, "That's Chairman Mao!" A burst of applause rang out in the theater, and the farmers' joyous atmosphere did not stop until the movie was over. I hope that newsreels and science education films will be widely distributed to rural areas in the future.

    农村需要新闻纪录片
    现在农村看到的影片大都是故事片，很少看到反映农村新面貌和国内外大事的新闻纪录片和科学教育片。前不久放映的“刘介梅忘本回头”、“东风压倒西风”等纪录短片，农民看了非常喜欢，并从中受到了很大教育。有的农民看到了电影里的毛主席时就高声叫着：“那是毛主席”。场内响起一片掌声，一直到电影演完农民们的欢腾气氛还没有停止。希望今后普遍往农村发行新闻纪录片和科学教育片。
