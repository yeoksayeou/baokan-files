	On the Way Home
	Meng Guangmin
	I couldn't even find someone to ask for directions on the street. Right! I'll try my luck at the supply and marketing cooperative. I walked out of the supply and marketing cooperative, feeling so happy. I really wanted to look in a mirror to see the smile on my face. I stepped onto the road with a feeling of joy I had never experienced on my way home before, and headed south.
	I go home once a year, but every time I return, there's always a bit of unpleasantness during the journey. It's the thirty-plus li stretch after getting off the train that adds to my worries. This area is the disaster zone of the Hun River (Yongding River). It floods nine years out of ten, and the road is extremely difficult to travel. In the past, my family lived in Kongwa Village, nicknamed "Unlucky Nest." When other places were dry, we were waterlogged; even a small amount of water would cause a major disaster. Whenever the river flooded, the water flowed into our area as if pouring into a large pit, flooding fields, collapsing houses, and swallowing countless lives and properties. After liberation, the government built the Guanting Reservoir to control the floods. However, because our land was low-lying, we still suffered from waterlogging every year. To help the disaster victims in this area, the government organized resettlement. That's how my family moved to Xiazhuang Village.
	Getting off the train at Qiuzhangzhuang, you have to go through this disaster area. Because there's water all year round, there's no formal road here at all. You can only tell the direction by looking at the sun during the day. You have to ask for directions more than ten times to cover the thirty-some li, and even then, you can't avoid wading through mud and water, taking a roundabout route that takes almost a whole day. Sometimes you even encounter something called "suosha" on the road. If you accidentally fall into it, you have to lie down and roll out immediately, otherwise you'll pull out your left foot and sink your right foot, sinking deeper and deeper. If there's no one passing by, you might even lose your life. So, many people are afraid of walking this stretch of road. Some people simply go straight to Tianjin and then take a bus in a U-shape to get home.
	This day, I got off the train with a feeling of great joy in returning home but also great fear of walking. Who would have thought that when I asked at the supply and marketing cooperative, the salesperson told me, "Go straight south, get on the highway, and keep going straight." I was so afraid that I misheard or the salesperson misspoke that I asked again, "I'm going to Xiazhuang Village." "Yes, that's right." That's why I was so happy when I walked out of the supply and marketing cooperative.
	The highway was newly built, and to its west was a large canal. It seemed that the local people had used a method of killing two birds with one stone, both building canals and creating roads. The surrounding area was no longer the wasteland I had seen a year ago.
	There were few people on the road. After passing Yongqing, I saw a few women and children carrying manure to the fields. I was almost home when I came across a large embankment I had never seen before. A burst of singing entered my ears:
	"Crazy River, Crazy River! The Crazy River goes mad every year, making it impossible for the people to live... "
	This song was written by the local disaster victims and was also one I often sang as a child. The origin of the lyrics is that there is a river here that floods every year. In the past, people donated money and food to the Kuomintang to control this river, but the river still flooded. So, some people advocated asking the gods for blessings. They invited a fairy maiden to pray to heaven. The fairy maiden chanted Buddhist scriptures and said that the Dragon King had said that if they made offerings on the first and fifteenth of every month, the river would not flood. As a result, on the first and fifteenth of every month, wine, meat, and offerings were thrown into the river. The fairy maiden said that this river would change from unlucky to auspicious and gave it a special name called "Phoenix River." For two or three years, people kept making offerings, but the river kept flooding. Gradually, people stopped believing in the fairy maiden. Some people even questioned her. After that, no one was seen making offerings anymore. People changed "Phoenix River" back to "Crazy River."
	The embankment slowly moved towards me. The child's singing from earlier floated over again, sounding like it was connected to the previous part, but the words had changed:
	"The gods can't cure your crazy river disease!
	How can the people who fall into your crazy palms live?
	The savior Communist Party has come,
	Leading us poor people to control the Crazy River.
	The prescription they prescribe is to organize cooperatives.
	To cure the Crazy River, you have to take more labor pills.
	The labor pills of many people are powerful!
	Curing the 'Crazy River' turns it into the 'Phoenix River.'
	The Phoenix River spits out silver pearl water from its mouth,
	Watering the wheat fields and producing more wheat."
	I walked faster and climbed up the embankment, wanting to see who was singing. Look! He's on the opposite bank of the river, about thirteen or fourteen years old. He's also trying to cross to this side of the river. I took a deep breath and wanted to sing along with him loudly.

    归途中
    孟广岷
    街里连个问路的人都碰不到。对！到供销社去碰碰看。我走出供销社，心里美嗞嗞的，我真想照照镜子看一看自己脸上的笑容。我带着一种过去回家从未有过的愉快心情，踏上大道，一直向南奔去。
    我每年都回一次家，但每当回家途中总会有一段不快，这就是下火车后的三十多里路给我增添的烦恼。这一带是混河（永定河）灾区，十年九闹水，路非常难走。过去我家住在外号叫“倒霉窝”的孔洼村。别的地方旱，我们这儿却涝；有点小水就闹大灾。每当河水泛滥时，水往我们这一带流得就像灌大坑，淹地倒房，不知吞下多少人的生命财产。解放后政府修了官厅水库，节制洪水。但因我们那儿地洼却每年要沥涝。政府为了帮助这带灾民度日，组织了移民。我家才搬到了西安庄。
    从丘张庄下火车，一定要过这个灾区，因常年有水，这一带根本没正式的道路，只能白天看着太阳辨别方向走。三十几里路要问十几次道，就这样还免不了跋泥涉水，七绕八绕的走差不多一整天。有时路上还会遇到一种叫唆沙的东西，你要是失脚陷下去了，必须马上躺下打滚出来，否则就会拔左脚陷右脚，越陷越深，如果没有过路人甚至会丧命的。所以，很多人都怕走这段路，有的人干脆就直奔天津，然后坐汽车绕一个U字形回家。
    这一天我又抱着一种归家甚喜、走路甚怕的心情下了火车。谁想到了供销社一问，售货员却告诉我：“一直往南，上公路再一直走。”我深怕自己耳误或售货员口误，又追问了一句：“我是往西安庄。”“对呀，没错。”这就是我走出供销社欢喜的原因。
    公路是新修的，它的西边是一条大渠。看样子是当地人民用既修沟渠又成路一举两得的法子修成的。四周眺望也不再是我一年前看到的荒地了。
    路上很少见人，过了永清以后看到几个妇女和小孩正在往地里送粪。快到家了，又在眼前撞上了一条从未见过的大堤，一阵歌声荡入我的耳中：
    “疯河啊，疯河！疯河年年发疯性啊，闹得百姓没法活。……”
    这首歌是当地灾民编的，也是我小时候常唱的。歌词的来历是因为这儿有一条河，年年闹水。人们过去为了治这条河给国民党捐钱拿粮，但河水依旧泛滥，于是有人主张请神仙恩赐，请来仙姑向天祈祷，仙姑念了佛说，龙王爷讲了，如果每月初一、十五上供就可以不发水啦。结果每逢初一、十五酒肉供品一齐抛入河中。仙姑说，这条河要改凶为吉了，还特给它起了个名字叫“凤河”。两年，三年，人们供总上，河水也总泛滥，渐渐人们不相信仙姑了，有人还去质问过她，打这以后也看不到再来上供的人了。人们又把“凤河”说成“疯河”。
    大堤慢慢向我移动，方才那个小孩的歌声又从新飘过来，听起来好像和前边相接，可是词变了：
    “神仙医不好你疯河的病啊！
    落入你疯掌的人们可怎么活。
    来了救星共产党哟，
    领导咱穷人治疯河。
    药方开的是组织合作社，
    要想医好疯河服的劳动药丸就得多。
    人多劳动的药丸力量大哎
    医好了‘疯河’变‘凤河’。
    凤河吐出了口中的银珠水哟，
    水浇麦地产麦多。”
    我紧走几步上得堤来，想看看这是谁在唱歌。瞧！他就在河的对岸，看来有十三、四岁，他还正想往河这边走呢。我深深地吸一口气，也想跟他大声唱起来。
