Editor's Note:

	In the past few months, the tool reform movement in Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan, progressed very slowly. Is it that the masses have no need for this? No, the local labor force is very strained, and many farm tasks cannot be completed. Then why not think about reforming tools to improve labor efficiency? The basic reason is that many people are afraid to think this way, and of course, even more afraid to do it. Why are they afraid to think? They either say that their education level is low, or that they have no experience; in short, they don't believe in their own power. It is precisely this conservative thinking that shackles the productive forces and hinders the development of the tool reform movement. Now the problem in Neijiang Prefecture has been solved, but this problem is worth our attention.

	Building socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way is something everyone supports. However, are we implementing this spirit in every action? This is worth studying. If other regions also have situations where they are afraid to think and afraid to act, it will naturally affect the speed of production and construction work!

	To build socialism more quickly, we must dare to think boldly – let communist thought fly freely. How can we liberate our minds? This requires raising communist consciousness; it also requires overcoming the "three evils and five airs" in ideological style, and overcoming empiricism and dogmatism in ideological methods; it also requires conscientiously implementing the mass line in work, believing in and relying on the masses; it also requires improving certain rules and regulations that shackle thought.

    要解放思想
    前几个月，四川内江专区的工具改革运动进展得很缓慢。是群众对这方面没有需求吗？不是，当地劳动力十分紧张，许多农活做不过来。那么为什么不想法改革工具，提高劳动效率呢？基本原因是很多人不敢这样想，当然就更不敢做了。为什么不敢想呢？他们不是说自己文化水平低，就是说没有经验，总之一句话，不相信自己的力量。正是这种保守思想束缚着生产力，障碍了工具改革运动的开展。现在内江专区的问题是解决了，但是这个问题很值得我们重视。
    本着多快好省的方针建设社会主义，这是大家一致拥护的。但是，我们在每个行动中是不是贯彻了这种精神呢？这就很值得研究了。如果其它地区也有不敢想和不敢做的情况，自然也就会影响生产建设工作的速度了！
    要更快地建设社会主义，就要敢于大胆地想——让共产主义思想自由飞翔。怎样才能解放我们的思想呢？这需要提高共产主义觉悟；还需要克服思想作风上的三害五气，克服思想方法的经验主义和教条主义；还需要在工作中认真贯彻群众路线，相信群众和依靠群众；也需要改进某些束缚了思想的规章制度。
