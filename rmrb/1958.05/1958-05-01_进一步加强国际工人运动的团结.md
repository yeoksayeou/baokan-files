    Further Strengthen the Unity of the International Workers' Movement
    Zhong Ju
    May 1st International Labor Day is a day for the international working class to demonstrate its great strength of unity. Under the current new international situation, workers of all countries need to support and learn from each other even more in order to further develop the struggle to realize their common cause. Therefore, proletarian internationalist solidarity is particularly important.
    First, defending world peace is a major event for all mankind, and the issue of war and peace is of concern to everyone.
    In socialist countries, the broad masses of working people are carrying out socialist and communist construction at a rapid pace, and have achieved and are continuing to achieve great successes. These great achievements are the most important guarantee for defending world peace. In capitalist countries, the monopoly capitalist groups' policies of arms expansion and war preparations are intensifying the exploitation of workers. The strike struggles and the desire to defend peace of workers in capitalist countries are closely linked. In nationally independent countries or countries striving for national independence, the anti-colonialist struggles of workers and the broad masses of people are also closely linked to the struggle to defend peace.
    In recent times, workers' organizations of various countries, belonging to different social systems and with different political tendencies, have shown an unprecedentedly close attitude on the issue of defending world peace. For example, the West German Trade Union Federation, which participates in the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, opposes the Adenauer government's atomic armament and declared this year's "May 1st" as the day of the trade union struggle against atomic armament. Another example is the joint statement issued by the General Council of the British Trades Union Congress and the National Executive Committee of the British Labour Party on March 6, demanding that the British government stop nuclear weapons testing and calling for an international agreement on this issue, opposing US aircraft carrying nuclear weapons flying over Britain, and opposing the establishment of missile bases in Britain. They organized mass peace demonstrations in mid-April. The Japanese General Council of Trade Unions, which does not participate in international trade union organizations, is one of the initiators and organizers of the annual anti-atomic bomb and hydrogen bomb conferences held in Japan. Even in the United States, some trade union leaders have begun to advocate peaceful coexistence and demand that the US government change its current policies.
    Workers and trade union organizations under the leadership of the Communist Parties of all countries are following the direction pointed out by the Moscow Declaration and striving to defend world peace.
    The World Federation of Trade Unions recently called for a European workers' and trade union conference, in which many trade union organizations with broad representation will participate. This conference will make a significant contribution to defending peace in Europe.
    Second, the working classes of many countries are increasingly concerned about and actively participating in the struggle to win and safeguard national independence. They need mutual support and need to obtain the support of the working classes and peoples of the colonial powers and other countries. In nationally independent countries or countries striving for national independence, the working class is increasingly actively participating in the anti-colonialist political and economic struggles, and its leading role in this struggle is gradually becoming significant. In Indonesia, the working class actively promoted and participated in the struggle to recover West Irian, take over Dutch enterprises, and suppress domestic reactionary rebellions. In India, the working class has adopted a positive attitude towards the development of the national economy's Second Five-Year Plan. In Ceylon, the working class recently put forward the slogan of nationalizing British enterprises.
    In Africa, the Algerian people's armed struggle for national independence has been supported by workers' organizations from all over the world, especially Arab countries. The World Federation of Trade Unions launched an action week to support Algeria last year.
    In Latin America, the heroic struggles of the workers in Colombia and Venezuela played an important role in overthrowing the dictatorial regimes dependent on US imperialism. In Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, the labor movement has recently become an important component of the developing democratic forces. The Latin American working class is catching up in promoting and participating in the national independence movement.
    Third, the United States has recently experienced an economic crisis. According to official US statistics, the number of unemployed workers reached 5.2 million in March. The United States accounts for half of the capitalist world's industrial output, and it has large investments in many countries. This cannot but have a serious impact on capitalist countries. Canada and Belgium, where the United States has a lot of investment, are most affected, and the number of unemployed workers is rapidly increasing.
    The plans of the Western European bourgeoisie to establish a "European Common Market" or "European Free Trade Area" cannot escape the attack of the economic crisis. This is because Western European countries not only have a lot of American investment, but the capitalist economic systems of Western European countries have long been riddled with loopholes. The purpose of the "European Common Market" is that the bourgeoisie of the six Western European countries attempt to unite and intensify the exploitation of workers in order to make the capitalist economy survive. At present, the trade union organizations of the six countries, which belong to the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions, have held meetings or conducted consultations to discuss this issue.
    The US economic crisis has also had a serious impact on economically less developed countries. The mere measure of the United States restricting imports will have major consequences for countries that serve as raw material markets and processing factories, especially Latin American countries. Recently, food workers in Uruguay launched a major strike to oppose the closure of food factories owned by US capital due to overproduction, and demanded that these factories be nationalized. The United States' reduction in coffee imports has caused serious anxiety among plantation workers in Brazil.
    From the above three points, the unity of the current international workers' movement has its extraordinary significance. The unity of the international workers' movement, carrying out joint struggles, and exchanging experiences with each other will have a significant impact on the development of the international situation. However, the ideological and political differences that have long existed in the international workers' movement have hindered the cause of unity. Sibling infighting has precisely given the bourgeoisie an opportunity to exploit. The situation is educating workers in various countries. After contact, mutual understanding, consultation, and negotiation, many workers' organizations and labor movement leaders with different political tendencies have to varying degrees restored their common class feelings and spirit of friendly cooperation.
    The unity of the Communist Parties of all countries is the core of the international unity of the working class. Bringing workers' organizations with different political tendencies closer together, and attracting a large number of workers who have not yet been organized to unite, can make the great unity of the working class around the world develop and become more consolidated.
    In recent years, exchanging delegations with each other by workers' organizations of various countries during the "May 1st" International Labor Day has helped to enhance mutual understanding and international solidarity. This year, more than 40 trade union organizations from Asia, Africa, and countries around the world have been invited by the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to come to our country to celebrate "May 1st" International Labor Day. This also shows that the desire for solidarity among the working classes of all countries is growing.
    Let the "May 1st" International Labor Day of 1958 be a day symbolizing the great development of the unity of the international workers' movement!

    进一步加强国际工人运动的团结
    锺巨
    “五一”国际劳动节是国际工人阶级表现它的伟大团结力量的日子。在当前国际新形势下，各国工人阶级为了进一步发展实现共同事业的斗争，更加需要相互支援，相互学习。因此，无产阶级国际主义团结显得特别重要。
    第一、保卫世界和平是全人类的大事，战争与和平的问题为人人所关心。
    在社会主义国家里，广大劳动人民以跃进的步伐进行社会主义和共产主义建设，已经取得并正在继续取得巨大的成就。这些伟大的成就是保卫世界和平最重要的保证。在资本主义国家里，垄断资本集团的扩军备战政策，加剧了对工人的剥削。资本主义国家工人的罢工斗争和保卫和平的愿望是密切结合的。在民族独立国家或正在争取民族独立的国家里，工人和广大人民的反殖民主义斗争也是和保卫和平的斗争密切联系的。
    最近时期，在保卫世界和平问题上，属于不同社会制度的和具有不同政治倾向的各国工人组织，表现了前所未有的接近的态度。譬如参加国际自由工联的西德工会联合会反对阿登纳政府原子武装，宣布今年“五一”为工会反对原子武装的斗争日。又如英国职工大会最高委员会和英国工党全国执行委员会在3月6日发表联合声明，要求英国政府停止核武器试验，并要求对这一问题达成国际协议，反对载有核武器的美国飞机在英国上空飞行，反对在英国建立导弹基地。它们曾在4月中旬组织了群众性的和平示威。不参加国际工会组织的日本总评是一年一度在日本举行的反对原子弹、氢弹大会的发起者和组织者之一。即使在美国，有些工会领袖也开始主张和平共处，要求美国政府改变目前的政策。
    在各国共产党领导下的工人和工会组织都正在遵循着莫斯科会议宣言所指出的方向，为保卫世界和平而努力奋斗。
    世界工会联合会最近号召举行欧洲工人和工会会议，将有许多具有广泛代表性的工会组织参加，这次会议将对保卫欧洲和平作出重大的贡献。
    第二、许多国家的工人阶级愈来愈关心并积极参加争取和维护民族独立的斗争，它们需要相互支援，需要取得宗主国和其它国家工人阶级和人民的支援。在民族独立或正在争取民族独立的国家中，工人阶级正在日益积极参加反殖民主义的政治和经济的斗争，他们在这一斗争中的领导作用正在逐渐显著。在印度尼西亚，工人阶级积极推动并参加了收回西伊里安、接管荷兰企业、镇压国内反动叛乱的斗争。在印度，工人阶级对于发展民族经济的第二个五年计划采取了积极的态度。在锡兰，工人阶级最近提出了要求把英国企业国有化的口号。
    在非洲，阿尔及利亚人民的争取民族独立的武装斗争，得到了世界各国、首先是阿拉伯各国工人组织的支援。世界工会联合会在去年曾发起了支援阿尔及利亚的行动周。
    在拉丁美洲，哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉工人的英勇斗争，对推翻依附美帝国主义的独裁统治制度起了重要作用。在阿根廷、巴西和智利，最近时期工人运动已成为正在发展中的民主力量的重要组成部分。拉丁美洲的工人阶级正在迎头赶上推动和参加民族独立运动。
    第三、最近美国发生了经济危机。据美国官方统计，3月份失业工人已达五百二十万人。美国工业产量占资本主义世界的半数，并且它在许多国家中有着大量投资。这就不能不对资本主义各国发生严重的影响。美国投资较多的加拿大、比利时受影响最大，失业工人数迅速增长。
    西欧各国资产阶级建立“欧洲共同市场”或“欧洲自由贸易区”的计划决不能幸免于经济危机的袭击。因为西欧各国不仅有大量美国投资，而且西欧各国的资本主义经济制度也早已露出了百孔千疮的现象。“欧洲共同市场”的目的就是西欧六国资产阶级企图联合起来加紧对工人的剥削来使资本主义经济苟延残喘的。目前，六国工会组织正在联合起来，共同对付资产阶级的进攻。最近分别属于世界工会联合会、国际自由工会联合会和国际天主教工会联合会的六国工会组织已分别召开会议或进行协商，讨论了这一问题。
    美国经济危机对经济发展比较落后的国家也产生了严重的影响。单是美国限制进口一项措施，就会对作为原料市场和加工工场的国家，特别是拉丁美洲各国产生重大的后果。最近乌拉圭食品工人就发动了为反对美国资本的食品工厂因生产过剩而关闭的大罢工，并且要求把这些工厂收归国有。美国减少咖啡进口，已引起巴西种植园工人的严重不安。
    从以上三点来看，当前国际工人运动的团结就有其异常的重要意义。国际工人运动团结一致，进行共同斗争，互相交流经验，就会对国际形势的发展产生重大影响。但是，国际工人运动中长期以来所存在的思想上和政治上的分歧，妨害了团结事业。亲兄弟自相争吵恰恰为资产阶级钻了空子。形势教育着各国工人，许多持有不同政治倾向的工人组织和工人运动领导者经过接触、相互了解、协商会谈以后，已在不同程度上恢复了共同的阶级感情和友好合作的精神。
    各国共产党的团结是工人阶级国际团结的核心。使具有不同政治倾向的工人组织相互接近，并且吸引大量还没有组织起来的工人团结起来，可以使全世界工人阶级的大团结更加发展和更加巩固。
    近年来，每逢“五一”国际劳动节，各国工人组织相互交换代表团，是有助于增进相互了解和国际团结的。今年应中国工会邀请前来我国庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的有亚非和世界各国的四十多个工会组织。这也可说明世界各国工人阶级团结愿望正在增长着。
    让1958年的“五一”国际劳动节成为象征国际工人运动的团结大大发展的一个日子吧！
