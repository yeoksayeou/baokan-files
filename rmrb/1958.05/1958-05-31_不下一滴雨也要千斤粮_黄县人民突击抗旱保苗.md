Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th - The news of the victorious conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party has greatly encouraged the people of Huang County, Shandong Province, who are striving to achieve the goal of a "thousand-jin county" this year. At the "flying" conference of the Party Committee Secretaries of all townships in Huang County, held on the 27th, after listening to the report from Zhang Ming, the First Secretary of the Huang County Party Committee, who had just returned from the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, he put forward the bold slogan of "Even without a drop of rain, we must harvest a thousand jin of grain." It was decided to immediately mobilize the people of the county to resolutely implement the spirit of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" with practical actions to overcome the drought and ensure a bumper harvest.

The meeting requested that the people of the county, on the basis of unifying their thinking and boosting their morale, universally irrigate the wheat fields, which promised a good harvest, twice within four or five days. At the same time, they should launch a crash campaign to combat drought, irrigate and protect seedlings, and also interplant all sweet potato ridges with corn before June 1st. The entire county should ensure that no one is idle, no well is idle, and no water-lifting tool is idle. Through this drought resistance effort, the county's water conservancy movement should be developed more deeply.

The meeting called on the people of the county to implement the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in the struggle against drought, to promote the spirit of communist cooperation, and to break down the boundaries between societies and teams to support each other. It called on all organs, enterprises, troops, and schools to fully support the drought resistance struggle. Handicraft cooperatives should move to the construction sites to repair and rush-produce water-lifting tools on the spot.
