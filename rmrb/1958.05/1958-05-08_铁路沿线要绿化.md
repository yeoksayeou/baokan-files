　　Afforestation Along Railway Lines
　　After completing the Lizhan Railway, the Railway Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army launched a tree planting campaign in the blazing summer heat. We want to dress the railways of New China in beautiful green clothes and create wealth for the country.
　　In less than three years, I passed through the Lizhan Railway again and saw that the trees we planted with our own hands had grown as thick as bowls and two or three zhang tall. The Lizhan line has been covered with green clothes. In a few more years, these trees will be a great fortune for the people, and there will be no need to transport railway sleepers from afar.
　　I suggest that newly built railways should be planted with trees along the line; old lines should also be gradually afforested. Because afforestation along railway lines has three major benefits: First, the railway is beautiful and the air is fresh. Second, protect the quality of the roadbed; third, create wealth for the country.

    铁路沿线要绿化
    中国人民解放军铁道兵在修通了黎湛铁路之后，又在烈日炎炎的暑天，开展了种树运动，我们要使新中国的铁路穿上美丽的绿色衣裳，要为国家创造财富。
    现在不到三周年，重又经过黎湛铁路，看到我们亲手种的树，已经长得有碗口粗，有两、三丈高了，黎湛路沿线已经披上绿色衣裳。再长几年这些树就是人民的一宗大财富，铁路需用枕木也不必到远处去运了。
    我建议今后新修的铁路，沿线都种上树；老线也应该逐步实现绿化。因为铁路沿线绿化有三大好处：第一、铁路美观，空气新鲜。第二、保护路基质量；第三、为国家创造财富。
