Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch With the urgent need for the summer harvest and planting, a mass movement of farm tool reform has set off another wave in various places. Tomorrow is Grain Full, and the busy farming season in the countryside has arrived. From the Huai River basin to both banks of the Yellow River, from the plains to the mountains, farmers can be seen manufacturing, imitating, and improving various types of summer harvest and planting farm tools.

According to statistics from Henan, Hebei, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shandong, Anhui, and other provinces, more than 190 counties and cities have trialed and improved approximately 2.6 million summer harvest and planting farm tools. These reformed farm tools can be basically divided into six categories: first, various harvesters that are easy to use and have high work efficiency; second, threshing machines or threshers that are fast and clean; third, various small and flexible vehicles for transporting wheat and fertilizer; fourth, field-threshing and wheat-rolling tools that can be dragged quickly and press heavily; fifth, farm tools including those for summer planting, plowing, harrowing, and field operations; and sixth, machinery and tools for flour milling, crushing, and agricultural and sideline product processing. Compared with the old farm tools used in the countryside in the past, these farm tools can generally increase work efficiency by several times to dozens of times. At the same time, these farm tools are simple to manufacture, light and easy to use, made of local materials, and low in cost. Their manufacture fully complies with the policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and running all undertakings with diligence and thrift. For example, the foot-operated or hand-pushed harvesters manufactured by Henan farmers can harvest 30 to 35 mu of wheat a day by one person, which is 13 times faster than the old-fashioned sickle. The animal-powered harvester converted from a double-wheel double-share plow in Shaanxi Province is even more ingenious, and can harvest 40 mu of wheat per day. The hand-cranked wheat thresher created by farmers in Changge County, Henan, can thresh 70 mu of wheat a day, saving 120 labor and animal power. In terms of transportation tool reform, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, and Shandong mainly use steel sleeve ball bearings to transform various vehicles. According to calculations, the cost of transforming a small cart is only one yuan, and the cost of transforming a large cart is only seven or eight yuan. After the improvement, the pulling force can be reduced by three-quarters to four-fifths. In the past, it was thought that steel sleeve ball bearings could only be manufactured by large factories. Now people have broken the mysterious concept and found the secret of the machinery industry. Not only can county iron factories manufacture them, but even the ironworking groups of agricultural cooperatives can manufacture them in large quantities.

This year's summer harvest and planting tasks are busier than in previous years. More than 530 million mu of summer-ripening crops are growing unprecedentedly well, and the harvest will begin in a few days. With the bumper wheat harvest, more labor will be needed from harvesting and transportation to threshing. At the same time as the summer harvest, it is also a busy summer planting season, and various places generally feel that there is a shortage of manpower and animal power. In order to ensure the timely completion of the summer harvest and planting tasks, it is particularly necessary to reform farm tools.

In mobilizing the masses to reform farm tools, various places generally adopted the following three methods: First, in accordance with the spirit of "use what is needed, reform what is needed," launch a great airing of views, a great debate. In the debate, such questions were generally raised: "How to solve the shortage of labor? Is it to wait for mechanization, to continuously increase labor intensity, or to improve farm tools to increase work efficiency?" Then, discuss "Who to rely on to reform, what to reform?" Through debate and discussion, the broad masses of cadres and farmers realized the great significance of reforming farm tools for the summer harvest and planting, and their enthusiasm was greatly enhanced. Second, universally carry out the movement of everyone contributing ideas and everyone making suggestions. The masses participated in this movement like a surging tide, and even women and the elderly participated. For example, farmers in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan, contributed more than one million ideas in a few days. Under the slogan of "compare inventions, compare creations, compare reforms, compare more, faster, better, and more economical," Hengcun Township, Huaxian County, created 470 farm tools such as harvesters in three days. After the masses had creations and inventions, exhibitions were immediately held, visits and evaluations were organized, and promoted, which had great results. Third, because the task of reforming farm tools is large, there is a lack of technology, insufficient materials, and time is tight, it is very important to do a good job in all aspects of cooperation. Various forms of mutual assistance among cooperatives, collaboration among townships, apprenticeships with masters, training courses, Zhuge Liang meetings, and the organization of factories, handicraft cooperative departments, and agricultural cooperative iron and woodworking groups, as well as cooperation between intellectuals, technicians, and farmers, have promoted the rapid development of the summer harvest and planting farm tool reform movement.

Now, various places have trialed harvesting and threshing the various farm tools that have been successfully trial-produced on small plots of mature wheat fields, so as to make and improve them while working, create them in large quantities, and better expand the effect of farm tool reform.

### 大改夏收农具迎接夏季丰收  一百九十多县市创制和改良农具二百多万件  陕西省把双轮双铧犁改装成割麦机

    大改夏收农具迎接夏季丰收
    一百九十多县市创制和改良农具二百多万件
    陕西省把双轮双铧犁改装成割麦机
    新华社20日讯　随着夏收夏种的迫切需要，各地群众性的农具改革运动又掀起了一个浪潮。明天就是小满，农村大忙季节已经到来。从淮河流域到黄河两岸，从平原到山区，都可以看到农民在制造、仿制和改良各种各样的夏收夏种的农具。
    据河南、河北、湖北、江苏、陕西、山东、安徽等省统计，已经有一百九十多个县市试制和改良了约有二百六十万件夏收夏种农具。这些改革的农具基本上可以分为六类：一是使用轻便，工效很高的各式收割机；二是脱粒迅速、干净的脱粒机或脱粒器；三是便于运麦、运肥的各种小巧灵活的车辆；四是拖得快压得重的打场、碾麦工具；五是包括夏种、翻耕、耙和田间作业农具；六是磨面、粉碎和农副产品加工方面的机械和工具。这些农具和过去农村使用的旧农具比较，一般都能提高工作效率几倍到几十倍。同时，这些农具制造简单，轻巧好使，就地取材，成本低廉。在制造上完全符合多、快、好、省，勤俭办一切事业的方针。例如，河南农民所制造的脚蹬的或手推的收割机，一个人操作，一天能收割麦子三十亩到三十五亩，比旧式镰刀快十三倍。陕西省利用双轮双铧犁改装的畜力收割机更加巧妙，每天可以割麦四十亩。河南长葛县农民创造的手摇小麦脱粒器，一天能打麦七十亩，可以节省一百二十个人力和畜力。河北、河南、陕西、山东在运输工具的改革方面，主要是利用钢套滚珠改造各种车辆。据计算，改造一辆小车只需成本一元，改造一辆大车只需七、八元，改良后拉力能减轻四分之三到六分之五。过去认为钢套滚珠是大工厂才能制造的，现在人们打破了神秘观念，找到了机械工业的秘密，不但县的铁工厂能制造，就连农业社的铁工小组也能大量制造了。
    今年夏收夏种的任务比往年都要繁忙。五亿三千多万亩夏熟作物生长得空前良好，再有几天就要开镰收割了。小麦大丰收，从收割、运输到脱粒就需要更多的劳动力。与夏收同时，又是繁忙的夏种，各地普遍感到人力畜力不足。为了保证夏收夏种任务的及时完成，就特别需要改革农具。
    各地在发动群众改革农具中，一般采用了以下三个办法：一、根据“用什么，改什么”的精神，展开大鸣大放大辩论。在辩论中一般都提出了这样的问题：“劳力不足如何解决？是坐等机械化，是不断增强劳动强度，还是改良农具提高工效？”接着又讨论“依靠谁来改，改革什么？”通过辩论和讨论，广大干部和农民认识到改革农具对夏收夏种的重大意义，积极性大大提高了。二、普遍开展人人献计策，个个出主意的运动。群众风起云涌地参加这一运动，甚至连妇女老人也参加进来了。例如河南许昌专区农民在几天中就献计一百多万条。滑县横村乡在“比发明、比创造、比改革、比多快好省”的口号下，三天内就创造出各种收割机等农具四百七十件。在群众有了创造和发明以后，立即开展览会，组织参观评比，加以推广，收效很大。三、由于改革农具的任务大，缺乏技术，材料不足和时间紧迫，因此搞好各方面的协作非常重要。各地开展的社社互助、乡乡协作，师傅带徒弟、开训练班、开诸葛亮会以及组织工厂、手工业社部门和农业社铁木业小组协作，知识分子、技术人员和农民协作等形式，都促进了夏收夏种农具改革运动的迅速发展。
    现在，各地已把试制成功的各种农具在小块成熟的麦地试行收割、脱粒，以便边作边改、大量创造，更好地扩大农具改革的效果。
