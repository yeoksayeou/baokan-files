Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd, New York Dispatch: An American "air defense" rocket base experienced a massive explosion on the 22nd. Seven Nike rockets on the base simultaneously launched into the sky with a loud bang.

According to preliminary investigations, the explosion of the rockets caused at least seven to ten deaths and dozens of injuries. Some of the deceased were completely obliterated.

This rocket base, located in Middlesex, thirty miles south of New York, is one of many similar bases established within the United States by the authorities to create war hysteria. Since the establishment of this rocket base, the nearby residents have lived in constant anxiety for several years. Just days before this explosion, the American authorities once again assured the uneasy residents that there would be no danger.

The exploded rockets flew in all directions, with one entire rocket landing in New York Harbor. The rest landed in farmland, squares, and forests. Many houses near the rocket base were damaged by the shockwave.

According to the Associated Press, the explosion was caused by the installation of a "new device" on one of the rockets. The news agency also said that a few hours before the explosion, the U.S. Army authorities had announced that they were going to convert the rockets on the nine Nike rocket bases in northern New Jersey, which were not carrying atomic warheads, into more powerful rockets carrying atomic warheads.

    美国战争狂人玩火自焚
    纽约附近火箭基地爆炸
    新华社23日讯  纽约消息：美国的一个“防空”火箭基地22日发生巨大的爆炸，这个基地上的七门奈克火箭在一声巨响中一齐飞上了天。
    据初步调查，火箭的爆炸至少造成了七到十个人的死亡和数十个人受伤。有些死者连一点血肉都不见了。
    这个火箭基地建立在纽约以南三十英里地方的米德耳市，是美国当局为了制造战争歇斯底里而在国内建立的许多类似基地之一。自从这个火箭基地建立后，附近的居民几年来就一直过着提心吊胆的生活。就在发生这次爆炸以前不几天，美国有关当局还再一次向惴惴不安的居民保证不会有什么危险。
    爆炸后的火箭向四面八方乱飞，有一整个火箭落在了纽约港里。其余有的落在农田里、广场里和树林里。火箭基地附近的许多房屋都被震坏了。
    据合众社报道，这次爆炸是由于在向一门火箭上安装“新装置”而引起的。这家通讯社还说，在爆炸发生前不几小时，美国陆军当局曾经宣布，要把新泽西州北部的九个奈克火箭基地上的不载原子弹头的火箭，改装为载有原子弹头的威力更大的火箭。
