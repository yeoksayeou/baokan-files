Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 7th: Pflimlin, the right-wing leader of the French Social Democratic Resistance Alliance, who declared his failure to form a cabinet on the 3rd, yesterday once again accepted the President's request to strive to complete the mission of ending the protracted government crisis. Today marks the twenty-second day of this crisis.

When Pflimlin was first ordered to form a cabinet, he originally intended to organize a government including the Socialist Party to the right-wing "Independent Party." However, this time, he can only organize a government with a narrow foundation. The Socialist Party reiterated that it would not participate in the government, but it promised to vote in favor of Parliament authorizing Pflimlin to be Prime Minister. The Radical Socialist Party demanded that Pflimlin promise not to allow right-wing "Independent Party" members to participate in the government as a condition for the party's participation in the government. The leadership of the Popular Republican Movement passed a resolution agreeing to participate in the government by a majority of only two votes. The "Independent Party" stated that it would see whether the main members of the new cabinet could guarantee the implementation of a tough North African policy before making a final decision.

    普利文再度受命组阁
    据新华社7日讯　巴黎消息：在3日宣告组阁失败的法国社会民主抵抗联盟右翼领袖普利文，昨天再一次接受总统的请求，来勉力完成结束旷日持久的政府危机的使命。到今天，这个危机已经延续了二十二天。
    普利文在第一次受命组阁的时候，本来打算组织一个包括社会党到右翼“独立党”在内的政府。但是这一次，他只能组织一个基础狭窄的政府。社会党重申不参加政府，不过它答应将投票赞成议会授权普利文当总理。激进社会党要普利文答应不让右翼“独立党”人参加政府，作为这个党参加政府的条件。人民共和党的领导机构仅以两票的多数通过了同意参加政府的决定。“独立党”则表示要看看新内阁的主要成员是否能保证执行强硬的北非政策，然后再作最后决定。
