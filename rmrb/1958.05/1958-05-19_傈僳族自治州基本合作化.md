　　Basic Cooperation in the Lisu Autonomous Prefecture

　　(Our Reporter Huang Changlu) The Lisu people in the Nujiang area of Yunnan Province, one of the ethnic minorities in the country that transitioned directly from a pre-feudal society to socialism, have become the first to achieve cooperation.

　　The Lisu ethnic group in Yunnan Province numbers more than 230,000, mainly living in the Gaoligong Mountains and Biluo Snow Mountains on both sides of the Nujiang River in northwestern Yunnan Plateau. For centuries, the Lisu people have been using wooden plows and one-inch-wide small hoes to grow crops on steep slopes with gradients of 50 or 60 degrees. Before liberation, the average person only had 200 catties of grain per year. Due to low productivity and isolated transportation, the social development of the Lisu people was very slow, and at the time of liberation, there were still strong remnants of primitive communes. Based on this primitive and backward economy, the Lisu people's thinking was dependent on nature, worshiping ghosts and gods, and attributing the good or bad harvest and the high or low yield to the moods of gods and ghosts, so many backward customs such as killing livestock to worship ghosts were prevalent.

　　After liberation, the Party trained hundreds of Lisu cadres, united public leaders who had contact with the masses, and established the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture in 1954.

　　Party organizations and cadres at all levels in the Nujiang area actively educated and guided the poor Lisu farmers to organize, and began to establish various types of mutual aid groups in 1953. In 1956, 146 agricultural producers' cooperatives were established in two batches on a trial basis, and the number of peasant households joining the cooperatives accounted for 12.7% of the total number of households in the prefecture.

　　In order to fundamentally change the fate of relying on the weather, they opened up 60,000 mu of terraced fields in the Gaoligong Mountains and Biluo Snow Mountains. According to the consciousness of the masses and local conditions, the Nujiang area Party committee actively led the masses on water conservancy construction sites to launch debates, absorbing a large number of poor farmers into the cooperatives. Up to now, 85% of the peasant households have joined the cooperatives, basically realizing cooperation.

　　The Lisu people have decided to open up another 120,000 mu of terraced fields next year, basically realizing water conservancy and terraced fields, and achieving a grain yield of 800 catties per mu within five years. While promoting cooperation, local industries are also being vigorously developed. The state has sent exploration teams here to help find underground resources. Fifty-four factories and mines have been built, and the first batch of Lisu workers has been born. It is also planned to vigorously promote the Lisu writing system created with the help of the People's Government, and eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people within three years. The Lisu people, who were historically far behind, are on the verge of joining the ranks of advanced socialist nationalities.

### 傈僳族自治州基本合作化

　　傈僳族自治州基本合作化
    本报讯　记者黄昌禄报道：全国由前封建社会直接向社会主义过渡的少数民族中，云南边疆怒江地区的傈僳族第一个实现了合作化。
    云南省傈僳族共二十三万多人，主要聚居在滇西北高原怒江两岸的高黎贡山和碧罗雪山上。几个世纪以来，傈僳人一直使用木犁和一寸宽的小锄在倾斜达五、六十度的陡坡上种庄稼。解放前平均每人每年只有两百斤粮食。由于生产力低，交通隔绝，使得傈僳族的社会发展非常缓慢，到解放时仍保存着浓厚的原始公社残余。在这种原始落后的经济基础上，形成傈僳人的思想依附自然，崇拜鬼神，把年成的丰歉、产量的高低都归于神鬼的喜怒，因而流行着杀牲祭鬼等许多落后习俗。
    解放后，党培养了几百名傈僳族的干部，团结了与群众有联系的公众领袖，并在1954年建立了怒江傈僳族自治州。
    怒江地区各级党组织和干部积极教育和引导傈僳族的贫苦农民组织起来，从1953年开始成立了各种类型的互助组，在1956年分两批试办了一百四十六个生产合作社，入社农户占全州总农户的12.7％。
    他们为了根本改变靠天吃饭的命运，在高黎贡山和碧罗雪山上开出六万亩梯田。怒江地区党委根据群众的觉悟及当地条件，积极领导水利工地上的群众展开辩论，吸收广大贫苦农民入社，到目前为止，已有85％的农户加入了合作社，基本实现了合作化。
    傈僳族人民决定明年再开十二万亩梯田，基本实现水利化和梯田化，五年内达到每亩产粮八百斤。在合作化同时，又大兴地方工业，国家派出了勘探队到这里帮助找寻地下资源，现已建成五十四个厂矿，诞生了傈僳族的第一批工人。还准备大力推行人民政府帮助他们创制的傈僳文字，三年内扫除青壮年中的文盲。历史上被远远抛在后面的傈僳族，跻于先进的社会主义民族行列已经指日可待了。
