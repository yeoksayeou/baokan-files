    Retired Cadre Lü Jiuchun
    On March 9th, when I went to Qingchi Village, Ji County, Hebei Province, to understand the civil affairs work, the person who briefed me was Lü Jiuchun, the director of the agricultural cooperative. He had just retired from the Tongzhou City People's Bank on New Year's Day this year. From the first day he returned to his hometown, he worked day and night to achieve a thousand-jin cooperative. He also gave his retirement pay of six hundred yuan to the agricultural cooperative as production funds. He retired home, but still played an important role.

    退职干部吕九春
    3月9日，我到河北省蓟县青池村了解民政工作情况时，向我介绍情况的是农业社主任吕九春同志。他是今年元旦才从通州市人民银行退职回来的。从他回乡的第一天起，就日日夜夜为实现千斤社而奔忙。他领到的退职金六百元，也交给农业社作了生产资金。他退职回家，仍然发挥了重要的作用。
