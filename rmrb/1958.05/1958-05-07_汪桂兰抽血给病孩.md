    Wang Guilan Donates Blood to Sick Child
    Our little girl, Wang Ji Yuan, suffered a serious illness. Because of economic difficulties, she did not receive timely treatment, which resulted in her condition becoming very serious before we took her to the Beijing Mongolian and Tibetan Clinic for treatment. After examination, the doctor believed that the child was weak and needed to be injected with her mother's blood to strengthen her resistance. However, because her mother was pregnant, she could not donate blood. Just as we were hesitating, Comrade Wang Guilan, a nurse at the clinic, offered to donate her own blood for the child's injection. As a result, blood was drawn from Comrade Wang Guilan and injected into the child. We are extremely grateful to Comrade Wang Guilan for her great selfless act of saving lives.

    汪桂兰抽血给病孩
    我们的小女孩王继媛患了重病，因经济比较困难，未能及时治疗，以致使病情很严重的时候，才去北京市蒙藏门诊部看病。大夫检查后认为，小孩体弱需抽母亲血液注射，加强抵抗力。但因其母怀孕不能抽血。正在踌躇时，该门诊部护士汪桂兰同志提出要自己抽血给小孩注射，结果从汪桂兰同志身上抽了血注入小孩体内。汪桂兰同志这种伟大的舍己救人的行为是我们全家所感激的。　王震铭　陈玉芬
