Xinhua News Agency, Mishan, 8th dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporters Zhou Changzong and Jiao Huadong report: Since February of this year, a large number of transferred military officers from the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, as well as their families, have come to settle down in the Great Northern Wilderness.

Among these new residents of the Great Northern Wilderness are officers from the division, regiment, battalion, company, and platoon levels, combat heroes and special-class meritorious individuals, excellent sharpshooters, veteran Red Army soldiers who were once in the Jinggang Mountains, university students who recently joined the army, students from military academies and cultural schools, as well as editors, reporters, and members of the cultural troupe from military newspapers and periodicals. Some of them come from the border regions and coastal defense frontlines of the motherland, some from large cities such as Beijing and Shanghai, and some have just returned to the motherland from Korea.

They are determined to turn the Great Northern Wilderness into the "Great Northern Granary" of the motherland. Colonel Xiao Tianping, deputy division commander who participated in the Red Army troops in the Jinggang Mountains and also cleared bandits in the Great Northern Wilderness after Japan surrendered, said as soon as he arrived at the farm, "When we were suppressing bandits here in those years, we liked this land so much. I never expected that we would be able to reclaim it ourselves today." He proposed to the comrades who came with him: "We must have the confidence to overcome all difficulties and strive for a bumper harvest in the first year we reclaim this place."

The transferred military officers and their families who have come here have been settled in sixteen farms in Mishan, Hulin, Baoqing and other places. They are now engaged in productive labor while also taking time to build houses. So far, most people have moved into new homes and installed stoves in their houses. General Wang Zhen, Minister of the Ministry of Land Reclamation, also personally came to visit these new reclamation pioneers in April.

    放下枪杆拿起锄头　变北大荒为北大仓
    大批转业军官去开荒
    据新华社密山8日电　新华社记者周长宗、焦化东报道：今年2月以来，有大批中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军的转业军官以及他们的家属，来到北大荒安家落户。
    这些新来北大荒的居民当中，有师、团、营、连、排干部，有战斗英雄和特等功臣，有优秀射击手，有曾在井冈山上的老红军，有参军不久的大学生，有军事学院和文化学校的学员以及部队报刊的编辑、记者和文工团团员。他们有的来自祖国的边疆和海防前线，有的来自北京、上海等大城市，还有的刚刚从朝鲜回到祖国。
    他们坚决要把北大荒变成祖国的“北大仓”。曾在井冈山上参加红军部队、日本投降后又在北大荒清剿过土匪的副师长萧天平上校，一到农场就说，当年在这里剿匪的时候，我们是多么喜欢这片土地，没想到今天能够亲手来开垦它。他向一起来的同志提出：我们头一年开垦这个地方，就要有信心克服一切困难，争取大丰收。
    来到这里的转业军官及其家属，已经分别安置到密山、虎林、宝清等地十六个农场。他们现在一面投入生产劳动，一面抽空修建房屋。到现在为止，多数人已经搬进新宅，并在屋里安上锅灶。农垦部部长王震将军，于4月间还亲自前来看望过这些新来垦荒的人们。
