    Raising Scorpions

    The scorpion, an animal that people consider poisonous and terrifying, is being raised by farmers in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, as a sideline production. If you put ten jin of scorpions into a scorpion house between May and June, you can harvest fifty jin of scorpions between July and August of the following year.

    Scorpions have great medicinal value. They can be used as an antispasmodic and are the main drug for treating infantile convulsion and spasm.

    Last year, Guanghua County purchased 4,212 jin of scorpions, which is equivalent to increasing farmers' income by more than 43,000 yuan. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    养蝎子
    一种人们认为有毒可怕的动物——蝎子，却被湖北省光化县农民饲养起来作为一项副业生产。5、6月间把十斤蝎子投入蝎子房，到第二年7、8月间就可以收获五十斤蝎子。
    蝎子在医药上有很大用处，可作镇痉剂，是治小儿惊风、痉搐的主要药物。
    光化县去年全县收购蝎子四千二百一十二斤，等于增加农民收入四万三千多元。（据新华社讯）
