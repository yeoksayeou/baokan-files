Lopu, located in the southeastern part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, is a prosperous area. Situated in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo River, it borders Bomê and Kongpo to the northwest, Zayu to the east, and India to the south. The Yarlung Tsangpo River flows through the entire region, and warm winds from the Indian Ocean enter along the river valley, bringing a subtropical climate with nearly 2,000 millimeters of annual rainfall. Lopu has a low elevation, averaging around 700 meters above sea level, with a hot climate, abundant rainfall, and fertile land, resulting in a rich variety of agricultural products. These include highland barley, wheat, corn, sorghum, mandragora, and rice; economic crops such as soybeans, sesame, sugarcane, cotton, and tobacco; and subtropical fruits like bananas, lemons, and oranges in abundance. The east, west, and north sides of Lopu are surrounded by continuous mountain ranges – the eastern end of the Himalayas. Snow mountains, over 5,000 meters high, block wind, snow, and cold currents from northern Tibet. Therefore, the area is frost-free and snow-free, with green vegetation all year round, and three harvests are possible annually. People call Lopu the Jiangnan of the Tibetan Plateau.

Lopu people, Monpa people, and Tibetan people live here. Throughout history, they have been united, marrying and befriending each other. There is abundant timber here, with vast primeval forests containing pine, fir, nanmu, birch, and many other tree species. Lopu is also rich in minerals, with mica deposits so abundant that many ore outcrops are exposed on the ground. Lopu also produces precious caterpillar fungus, dyes, cassia bark, fritillaria, deer antler, musk, and other products. (Xinhua News Agency draft) Ji Wenzheng Photo

    西藏高原上的江南——珞瑜
    珞瑜，是西藏地区（东南部）一个富庶的地方。它在雅鲁藏布江下游，西北靠波密和工布，东接察隅，南邻印度。雅鲁藏布江纵贯全境，印度洋的暖风顺着河谷流入，给这里带来了亚热带的气候，年雨量近两千公厘。珞瑜拔海很低，平均在七百公尺左右，气候炎热，雨量充沛，再加上土地肥沃，各种农产品极为丰富。农产品有：青稞、小麦、玉米、高粱、蔓加、稻谷等；经济作物有：黄豆、芝麻、甘蔗、棉花、烟等；香蕉、柠檬、桔子等亚热带水果也应有尽有。珞瑜的东西面和北面是连绵的群山——喜马拉雅山东端，高达五千公尺以上的雪山挡住了风雪和从藏北袭来的寒流，因此，这里无霜无雪，四季草木皆青，一年可以三熟。人们称珞瑜是西藏高原上的江南。
    这里居住着珞瑜人、曼人和藏人，历代他们团结得很好，互相结亲交友。这里的木材很多，参天的原始森林，分布地区极广、有松、杉、楠、桦和许多其它树种。珞瑜矿藏也很多，其中云母蕴藏量多得惊人，不少矿苗裸露在地面。珞瑜还出产名贵的虫草、染料、桂皮、贝母、鹿茸、麝香等。　冀文正摄（新华社稿）（附图片）
    珞瑜地区的水稻田，一派江南景色，农民一边劳动一边歌唱。
    珞瑜河谷的早晨。平静的湖水倒映出皑白的雪山。
    珞瑜盛产亚热带水果香蕉、拧檬等。一棵树结的香蕉要由一个强壮的农民才能抱得住。
    著名的珞瑜蜜桃成熟了，姑娘们从地上拣起从树上摇下来的大蜜桃。
    雅鲁藏布江下游水流湍急，人民在河流上架了两种别致的桥——藤索桥和藤蹓索。这是藤索桥。
