Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 19th: (Xinhua News Agency reporter Fan Sui) Local industrial products from Sichuan Province have been sold throughout the province. On the streets of Chengdu, Chongqing, Zigong, Neijiang and other places in early summer, many shop windows with local styles have appeared, and shop assistants are enthusiastically introducing these inexpensive, high-quality local products that suit the tastes of local consumers to customers. These local industrial products account for 70% to 80% of the total purchases of commercial departments in Sichuan Province.

The fundamental method for expanding the sales of local industrial products in Sichuan Province is to: face the local market and produce according to the needs and consumption habits of the people in the province. For example, the rubber shoes sold this year are produced according to the characteristics of the thick feet of the working people in Sichuan Province, so they sell very well. At present, local industrial products account for 6.65 million pairs of the 8 million pairs of rubber shoes planned for sale in the province. The Chinese-style cardigans and printed undershirts and绒衣 produced by cotton mills in various parts of Sichuan according to the local climate and consumer body types are very suitable for workers and peasants to wear during labor, and sales are also very strong. The province is planning to increase the annual output from 360,000 dozens to 1.6 million dozens. Improving product quality and reducing costs are also the main keys to opening up the sales of local industrial products. The equipment of local industries in Sichuan Province is generally relatively old, and the proportion of manual operation is quite large, but because workers modestly learn from foreign experience and improve operating methods, the "Jialing Brand" alarm clocks and "Changjiang Brand" accordions produced in Chongqing have become national first-class products, and the prices are cheaper than similar products from other places. The price of each Sichuan-produced thread blanket is only more than four yuan, which is about two yuan cheaper than products from other provinces. The price of ordinary pencils is more than 17% cheaper than Shanghai products, and 3 million dozens of these pencils are sold every year. As for general knitwear and chemical products such as DDT, saccharin, and camphor, their prices and quality are comparable to those of Shanghai products, and they have enjoyed a high reputation among the masses.

To meet the growing consumption needs of the people, adding new designs and trial-producing new products have been listed as major tasks. New products that have been successfully trial-produced include watches, cameras, bicycles, sewing machines, tape recorder-alarm clocks, and musical alarm clocks. Its impact will become increasingly apparent in the market in the future.

After the rectification campaign and the anti-"three evils" and anti-"five evils" movements, the commercial departments in Sichuan Province eliminated the old purchasing and sales concepts, strengthened cooperation with local industries in the province, and established the concept of facing production and serving consumers wholeheartedly. For example, the Chongqing Pharmaceutical Wholesale Station implemented the policy of "large purchases and large sales," collected samples of 84 advanced products for pharmaceutical factories, actively solved raw material supply problems, and assisted factories in making 13 new varieties such as肥猪片 to supply the needs of rural areas. Sichuan Province's spinning capacity is greater than its weaving capacity, and currently half of the cotton cloth relies on supplies from other provinces, but there is great potential for local textile machines in the province. They gave Shanghai cloth samples to local textile machine workers for trial weaving, and the resulting cloth was not inferior to Shanghai's. Because local cloth production is flexible and can be updated at any time, striped cloth, checkered cloth, and woolen cloth woven by local textile machines have become one of the most popular fabrics on the Sichuan market. Due to industrial and commercial cooperation, the production potential of local industries has been brought into play. At present, in Sichuan Province, except for a few daily necessities such as steel pots, toothpaste, and printed cloth, which have not yet been produced due to limitations in raw materials and equipment, local production can basically meet the needs for other consumer goods.

This year, in expanding the operation of local products, the commercial departments in Sichuan Province have also strengthened ties with other provinces, and have held regional economic cooperation conferences with neighboring Yunnan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi provinces to discuss measures for mutual support and cooperation in technology and raw materials in the development of local industries, in order to achieve common leaps forward. Some local factories have also sent workers to Shanghai and other places to learn advanced experience, and have tried their best to supply the province's products and raw materials needed by other places. It can be expected that in the development of local industries, this overall perspective will pave the way for the next step in the development of local industries.

### 四川地方工业生产适应当地人民消费习惯  地方产品在初夏市场占优势

　　四川地方工业生产适应当地人民消费习惯
　　地方产品在初夏市场占优势
    据新华社成都19日电　新华社记者范眭报道：四川省地方工业产品已经遍销省内各地。在初夏的成都、重庆、自贡、内江等地街头，出现了许多具有地方风格的橱窗摆设，商店营业员们热情地向顾客介绍这些价廉物美、适合当地消费者胃口的地方产品。这些地方工业产品已占四川省商业部门采购总额的70％到80％。
    四川省地方工业产品扩大销路的根本办法是：面向本地，根据本省人民的需要和消费习惯来生产。如今年销售的胶鞋，是按照四川省劳动人民脚型肥厚这一特点而生产的，因此销路很广。目前全省计划销售的八百万双胶鞋中，地方工业产品就占六百六十五万双。四川各地针棉织厂根据本地气候和消费者体型而生产的中式开襟和印花汗衫、绒衣，很适合工农群众劳动时穿著，销售也很畅旺，全省正计划把年产量从三十六万打提高到一百六十万打。提高产品质量和降低成本，也是打开地方工业产品销路的主要关键。四川省地方工业的设备一般比较陈旧，手工操作的比重相当大，但是由于工人们虚心学习外地经验，改进操作方法，现在重庆生产的“嘉陵牌”闹钟、“长江牌”手风琴已跃居为全国第一流产品，而价格却比外地同类产品便宜。四川生产的线毯每条价格仅四元多，比省外产品便宜二元左右。普通铅笔的价钱要比上海产品便宜17％以上，这种铅笔每年要销三百万打。至于一般针棉织品和化学产品如滴滴涕、糖精、樟脑等，无论价格、质量都可以同上海产品媲美，已在群众中享有很高的信誉。
    要满足人民日益增长的消费需要，把增添花色、试制新产品列为主要任务。现在已经试制成功的就有手表、照相机、自行车、缝纫机、带钟收音机、八音闹钟等新产品。它的影响将在今后市场上日益显现出来。
    经过整风和双反运动，四川商业部门破除旧的购销观点，加强同本省地方工业的协作，树立了面向生产和全力为消费者服务的观点。如重庆医药批发站贯彻“大买大卖”的方针，为药厂收集了八十四种先进产品的样品，并且积极解决原料供应问题，协助工厂制成了肥猪片等十三个新品种，供应了农村的需要。四川省纺纱能力大于织布能力，目前有一半的棉布要靠省外供应，可是省内的土机织布有很大潜力，他们把上海布样交给土机织布工人试织，结果织出的布并不比上海逊色。由于土布生产灵活，随时可以翻新花样，现在由土机织造的条布、格布、线呢，已成为四川市场上最吃香的布匹之一。由于工商协作，地方工业的生产潜力得到发挥。现在四川省除了钢精锅、牙膏、印花布等少数日用百货，因原料、设备等条件限制还没有生产外，其余消费品当地已基本上都能生产。
    今年四川商业部门在扩大经营地方产品中，也加强了同省外的联系，和邻近的云南、贵州、陕西等省，分别召开了地区间的经济协作会议，讨论彼此在发展地方工业中，技术上、原料上相互支援和配合的措施，以求共同跃进。一些地方工厂还派出工人到上海等地学习先进经验，对外地所需要的本省产品和原料也尽量供应。可以预期，在发展地方工业中，这种全局观点，将为地方工业下一步发展铺平道路。
