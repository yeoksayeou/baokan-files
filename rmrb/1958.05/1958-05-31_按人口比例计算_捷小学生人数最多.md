Czechoslovakia Has the Highest Number of Primary School Students per Capita

    Of the 260,000 to 295,000 babies born in Czechoslovakia each year, four-fifths are born in maternity hospitals. There are approximately 4,500 baby welfare stations throughout the country, providing guidance to mothers on all matters concerning babies.
    All children in Czechoslovakia can attend eight-year schools to receive general education. In 1957, there were more than 14,600 primary school students per 100,000 population, making it one of the countries with the highest proportion of primary school students in the population in the world. This year, 160,000 children across the country will take turns spending three-week vacations at Young Pioneer camps.

    按人口比例计算
    捷小学生人数最多
    在捷克斯洛伐克每年出生的二十六万到二十九万五千名婴孩中，有五分之四是在产科医院中出生的。全国各地大约有四千五百个婴孩福利站，它们在一切有关婴孩的事情上，对母亲们进行指导。
    捷克斯洛伐克所有的儿童都能进八年制学校接受普通教育。在1957年，每十万人口中就有一万四千六百多名小学生，是世界上小学生在人口中所占比例最多的国家之一。今年，全国将有十六万儿童轮流到少年先锋营度过三星期的假期。
