    Let Backbone Factories Play Their Role Sooner
    Harbin Expands and Continues to Build a Batch of Large Factories
    Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 25th. This year, a number of large factories in Harbin are undergoing expansion and continued construction. These include the Harbin Steam Turbine Factory, the Harbin Flax Factory, the Harbin Wire Factory, the First Machine Processing Factory, and the Harbin Bearing Factory.
    After these factories are expanded, they can rapidly expand the variety of products, improve quality, and increase production. After the expansion of the Harbin Bearing Factory, it will not only shift from producing ordinary bearings to producing a variety of precision bearings, but also the variety of bearings can be increased by 70%. After the expansion of the Harbin Flax Factory, the production capacity will double. The Harbin Boiler Factory, the only manufacturer of large power station boilers in the country, originally planned to start the second phase of expansion in 1960. In order to cooperate with the Steam Turbine Factory and the Electric Motor Factory to manufacture complete sets of large thermal power equipment, it has also started expansion this year ahead of schedule.
    At present, the basic construction departments of Harbin are taking various measures to accelerate the construction progress of large-scale industries, so that these backbone factories can play their huge role as soon as possible.

    让骨干工厂早日发挥作用
    哈尔滨扩建续建一批大厂
    新华社哈尔滨25日电　今年哈尔滨有一批大型工厂进行扩建和续建。其中有哈尔滨汽轮机厂、哈尔滨亚麻厂、哈尔滨电线厂、第一机械加工厂和哈尔滨轴承厂等。
    这些工厂扩建以后，可以迅速扩大产品种类、提高质量和增加产量。哈尔滨轴承厂扩建以后，不仅由生产普通轴承转向生产多种精密轴承，而且轴承的品种可以增加70％。哈尔滨亚麻厂扩建以后，生产能力将增加一倍。全国唯一的制造大型电站锅炉的哈尔滨锅炉厂，第二期扩建工程原计划1960年动工，为了配合汽轮机厂和电机厂制造成套的大型火力发电设备，也提前在今年动工扩建。
    目前，哈尔滨市的基本建设部门正在采取各种措施加速大型工业的建设进度，以便使这些骨干工厂能够早日发挥其巨大作用。
