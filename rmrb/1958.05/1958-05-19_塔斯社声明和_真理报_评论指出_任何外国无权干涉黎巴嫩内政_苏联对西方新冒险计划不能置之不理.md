　　TASS Statement and "Pravda" Commentary Point Out
　　Any Foreign Country Has No Right to Interfere in Lebanon's Internal Affairs
    The Soviet Union Cannot Ignore New Western Adventure Plans
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: TASS issued a statement on May 18th regarding the issue of foreign interference in Lebanon's internal affairs. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    Reports concerning the events that have occurred in Lebanon in recent days indicate that certain foreign powers are attempting to exploit these events to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs and exert new pressure on Arab countries in the Near East.
    Facts prove that the aforementioned powers are using the events in Lebanon to create new conspiracies to undermine peace and security in the Near East. This time, they have selected a small Arab country, Lebanon, as the object of their conspiracy.
    According to foreign newspapers, this is primarily manifested in the fact that the embassies of certain Western powers in Beirut no longer resemble diplomatic representative bodies handling relations between their countries and an autonomous Lebanon, but have become colonialist command centers. They are colluding with reactionary, anti-nationalist elements within Lebanon, grossly interfering in the country's internal affairs, and attempting to issue orders in the country as if it were a colony.
    The U.S. Sixth Fleet has received orders to immediately proceed to the coast of Lebanon. The Marine Corps of the U.S. military command in the Mediterranean region is rapidly increasing, and U.S. infantry is preparing to land along the Lebanese coast. According to a U.S. State Department spokesman, weapons have been shipped to Lebanon in order to suppress the peaceful Arab residents in the old colonialist way.
    It can be seen from press reports and statements by prominent figures that all these actions are being taken under a false pretext, namely, the assertion that the mass demonstrations in Lebanon by residents against foreign interference in internal affairs and in defense of national independence and the constitution were instigated by the United Arab Republic.
    These are well-known colonialist tactics. They have more than once destroyed the freedom and independence of small countries simply because they refused to wear the shackles of foreign oppression. They have previously used these methods to launch predatory colonial wars; currently, they are using these methods to force certain small countries to accept systems that are incompatible with the interests of their own people, but beneficial to foreign monopoly capital and in line with the strategic plans of military aggression blocs.
    How to explain the fact that intervention is being prepared against this country whose government once yielded to external pressure and expressed acceptance of the infamous "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine"?
    As long as one carefully examines the true motives and discards the nonsense disseminated in U.S. official propaganda to justify the intolerable behavior of the United States and certain other Western countries toward Lebanon, answering this question is not difficult.
    As is well known, the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine," a plan for blatant colonial plunder, has been rejected by the people of Arab countries. They justly regard it as incompatible with their true national interests and sovereignty.
    It can be seen at any time that the attempts by the founders of this doctrine to stifle the national liberation movements of the Eastern countries and to obstruct the unstoppable process of people striving for complete liberation from the evils of colonial rule are constantly meeting with new failures. Judging from all aspects, someone wants to revive this moribund doctrine and give it a shot in the arm. As for the means chosen by old and new colonialists for this purpose, they are not lacking in experience in this regard. However, there is one situation that they have apparently not taken into account. They have not taken into account that the era in which the outdated imperialist slogan of "divide and rule" could be successfully used has passed. For a hundred years, this slogan has been the motto of all colonialists.
    The people of countries that have achieved political independence hope to control their own wealth, hope to pursue independent policies that conform to their national interests without having to look to London or Washington.
    In short, the people of the East hope to be the full masters of their homeland, hope to live peacefully and amicably with all countries, and they are unwilling to live as the organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Treaty, and the Baghdad Pact hope. The organizers of these groups closely link their policies with the "Cold War," the arms race, and the endless expansion against weak countries and peoples.
    The actions taken by certain Western countries, led by the United States, against Lebanon are a manifestation of this policy. The peace-loving people of Lebanon only hope to live peacefully and amicably with their neighbors—other Arab countries—but this is precisely what is not to the liking of the colonialists. The colonialists want to tie up Lebanon's hands and feet, that is, to bind Lebanon politically and economically.
    The events unfolding around Lebanon also lead to an important conclusion.
    It is worth noting that these events are occurring when the dangerous hotbed of foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs has not yet been eliminated. In Indonesia, the imperialists are attempting before the eyes of the world to destroy the resistance of the Indonesian people who are defending their national independence through intimidation, pressure, and even direct aggression. Now, the imperialists have chosen Lebanon as a new object of their conspiracies and dangerous provocations, attempting to establish a colonialist system in Lebanon and strike at the national liberation movement throughout the Arab East.
    The leaders of the Soviet Union believe that the resolution of issues related to the Lebanese state is the inalienable right of the Lebanese people, and no foreign country has the right to interfere in these matters. Any attempt to exploit this or that event within Lebanon to interfere from the outside will create a dangerous situation in the Middle East and may have serious consequences not only for the fate of the Lebanese state and its indendence, but also for the fate of peace in the Middle East and Near East.
    The Soviet leaders express their belief that no major power will interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs, no matter what form this interference takes, and that no major power will allow the formation of a dangerous source of war in this region.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: According to TASS, Moscow: "Pravda" published a commentary today stating that the Soviet public cannot ignore the new adventure plans of the imperialists attempting to complicate the situation in the Arab East, which is close to the Soviet Union's southern border.
    The commentary pointed out that the recent provocative actions of the imperialist bloc in the Arab East contain serious consequences for the cause of peace in the Middle East and Near East and the world. Just as the interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, these actions cannot but arouse the close attention of all peace-loving public. The commentary said that in view of the failure of attempts to force the people of Arab Eastern countries to join aggressive blocs and the bankruptcy of the planned military offensive against Syria, the American imperialist bloc is now planning to use the Lebanon events to exert new pressure on the Arab people and carry out new provocations against the United Arab Republic. Now more than ever, the true meaning of the "Dulles-Eisenhower Doctrine" is clear.
    The commentary pointed out that, according to all indications, British colonialists and French reactionaries intend to support the adventurous actions of the American ruling clique in Lebanon. It should be stated bluntly that the interference of the imperialist powers in Lebanon's internal affairs is tantamount to a direct infringement on the national independence of the Arab countries and a direct threat to the peace and security of the people of these countries.
    The commentary concluded by saying that the people of all countries are making every effort to ease international tensions, to free mankind from the threat of atomic war, and to ensure lasting peace. Those who hinder the realization of this wish of hundreds of millions of ordinary people in all countries will inevitably be resolutely rebuffed by the peace-loving people of all countries.

### 塔斯社声明和“真理报”评论指出  任何外国无权干涉黎巴嫩内政  苏联对西方新冒险计划不能置之不理

　　塔斯社声明和“真理报”评论指出
　　任何外国无权干涉黎巴嫩内政
    苏联对西方新冒险计划不能置之不理
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社在18日就外国干涉黎巴嫩内政问题发表声明。声明全文如下：
    有关最近几天黎巴嫩所发生的事件的消息说，某些外国强国企图利用这些事件来干涉黎巴嫩的内政，并且对近东阿拉伯国家施加新的压力。
    事实证明，上述强国正在利用黎巴嫩事件制造新的阴谋，以破坏近东地区的和平与安全。他们在这一次选定了一个不大的阿拉伯国家黎巴嫩作为他们的阴谋的对象。
    据外国报纸报道，这首先表现在，某些西方强国驻贝鲁特的大使馆，已经不再像一些处理本国同自主的黎巴嫩之间关系的外交代表机关，而已经变成了殖民主义者的司令部，他们正同黎巴嫩国内反动的反民族主义分子串通一气，粗暴地干涉这个国家的内政，并且企图像对待殖民地那样在这个国家里发号施令。
    美国海军第六舰队接到了立即开赴黎巴嫩海岸的命令。地中海区域美军司令部的陆战队正在迅速增加，美国步兵正准备在黎巴嫩沿海地带登陆。据美国国务院发言人说，已经向黎巴嫩运送武器，以便按殖民主义者的老一套的办法来镇压阿拉伯的和平居民。
    从报刊消息和显要人士的声明中可以看出，所有这些作法都是在一个虚伪的借口下采取的，那就是硬说在黎巴嫩发生的居民反对外国干涉内政以及维护国家独立和宪法的群众性示威是阿拉伯联合共和国煽动起来的。
    这些都是殖民主义者的尽人皆知的手段，他们已经不止一次仅仅因为小国拒绝戴上外国压迫的镣铐而摧残这些国家的自由和独立。他们以前曾经采用过这种手段来发动掠夺性的殖民战争；目前采用这种手段，则是为了迫使某些小国接受同他们本国人民的利益格格不入而对外国垄断资本有利并且符合军事侵略集团的战略计划的制度。
    这个国家的政府是曾经向外来压力让步而表示接受臭名远扬的“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的。怎样解释准备对这个国家进行干涉这个事实呢？
    只要仔细研究真实的动机，而抛开美国官方宣传中为美国和其他某些西方国家对黎巴嫩所采取的令人不能容忍的行为进行辩解而散布的胡言乱语，那么，回答这一问题是并不困难的。
    如所周知，“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”这个公开进行殖民主义掠夺的计划遭到了阿拉伯各国人民的唾弃。他们公正地把它看作是同他们的真正的民族利益和主权格格不入的东西。
    随时可以看到，这个主义的创立者想扼杀东方各国人民的民族解放运动和阻挠各国人民争取从万恶的殖民主义统治下彻底解放的这一不可阻挡的进程，他们这样的企图正在不断遭到新的失败。根据各方面情况来判断，有人想使这个奄奄一息的主义复活，想给它注射强心剂。至于新老殖民主义者为此目的而选择一些手段，他们在这方面是不乏经验的。但是，有一种情况他们显然没有考虑到。他们没有考虑到可以成功地利用“分而治之”这个陈腐的帝国主义口号的时代已经过去了。一百年来，这一口号曾经是所有殖民主义者的座右铭。
    取得了政治独立的各国人民希望自己支配自己的财富，希望奉行符合他们民族利益的独立政策而不必看伦敦或者华盛顿的眼色。
    简单地说，东方的人民希望作为自己家乡的全权主人，希望同各国人民和平友好地相处，他们不愿意像北大西洋公约、东南亚条约和巴格达条约的组织者所希望的那样去生活。这些集团的组织者把他们的政策同“冷战”、军备竞赛和对弱小国家和人民无止境的扩张紧密地联系在一起。
    以美国为首的某些西方国家对付黎巴嫩的行动正是这种政策的表现。爱好和平的黎巴嫩人民只不过希望同他们的邻国——其他阿拉伯国家和平友好地相处，然而正是这一点不合乎殖民主义者的胃口。殖民主义者想把黎巴嫩的手脚捆起来，也就是在政治上和经济上把黎巴嫩束缚起来。
    围绕着黎巴嫩所展开的事件使人还得出一个重要的结论。
    值得注意的是：这些事件是发生在外国干涉印度尼西亚内政的危险温床还没有消灭的时候。在印度尼西亚，帝国主义者当着全世界人的面企图通过恫吓、施加压力直到直接进行侵略的途径来摧毁保卫本国独立的印度尼西亚人民的抵抗。现在，帝国主义者选定了黎巴嫩作为自己的阴谋和危险挑衅的新对象，他们企图在黎巴嫩建立殖民主义制度和打击整个阿拉伯东方的民族解放运动。
    苏联的领导人认为，同黎巴嫩国家有关的问题的解决，是黎巴嫩人民的不可剥夺的权利，任何外国都无权干涉这些事情。想利用黎巴嫩国内这种或那种事件来从外面进行干涉的任何企图都将在近东造成危险的局势，并且不仅可能对黎巴嫩国家的命运和它的独立带来严重后果，而且也可能对中近东和平的命运带来严重后果。
    苏联领导人表示相信，没有一个大国将要干涉黎巴嫩的内政，不管这种干涉是以什么形式出现，也没有一个大国会允许在这个地区形成危险的战争策源地。
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天发表评论说，苏联公众对帝国主义企图使紧挨着苏联南部边境的阿拉伯东方局势复杂化的新冒险计划不能置之不理。
    评论指出，帝国主义集团最近在阿拉伯东方进行的挑衅行为，对中近东和全世界的和平事业包含着严重的后果。正同对印度尼西亚内政所进行的干涉一样，这些行为不能不引起一切爱好和平的公众的密切注意。评论说，鉴于强迫阿拉伯东方各国人民加入侵略集团的做法失灵，对叙利亚所策划的军事进攻破产，美国帝国主义集团现在正打算利用黎巴嫩事件对阿拉伯人民施加新的压力，对阿拉伯联合共和国进行新的挑衅。现在比任何时候都更加清楚地看出“杜勒斯—艾森豪威尔主义”的真正含义。
    评论指出，根据一切迹象判断，英国殖民主义者和法国反动派有意支持美国统治集团对黎巴嫩的冒险行为。应该直截了当地说，帝国主义大国对于黎巴嫩内政的干涉，等于是直接侵犯阿拉伯国家的民族独立，等于是直接危害这些国家的人民的和平与安全。
    评论最后说，各国人民正在尽一切努力，争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取使人类摆脱原子战争的威胁，以保证持久和平。那些阻挠各国千百万普通老百姓实现这一愿望的人，不可免将会受到各国爱好和平人民的坚决反击。
