　　Facing Disaster
  　Tian Lianqian
    In striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production, it would be ideal to have a year of favorable weather. However, before humanity can "command the wind and summon the rain" and completely control nature, "Old Man Heaven" will always come to cause us trouble. Natural disasters, large or small, occur almost every year. Therefore, we cannot imagine the great leap forward in agricultural production to be so smooth.
    What should we do when natural disasters strike? There may be several different situations. One situation is to organize the broad masses of the people to fully counterattack the enemies of nature, use all methods to reduce losses, and adhere to the original great leap forward targets for agricultural production. Hebei Province, which suffered the worst drought in thirty years this year, is taking this path. They rose up to fight against the drought, maintained extremely strong morale, and the firepower of the drought resistance struggle became increasingly fierce, with the slogans "No rain, still ensure a bumper harvest!" and "Resolutely obtain eight billion (wheat)!" Their battle deployment is not only to cope with this year's drought, but also to strive to fundamentally eliminate drought and flood disasters through major measures such as fundamentally harnessing rivers and exploiting underground water sources. They concentrated the fighting will of tens of millions of revolutionary people, and brought into play the wisdom and creativity of tens of millions of people, and fully invested in the battle to turn bad things into good things. It can be expected that they will achieve greater achievements in water conservancy construction this year. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region also experienced a severe drought this spring, which reduced the early rice acreage by several million mu. But they did not lose heart either. The leading organs of the autonomous region put forward the battle slogan of "Reduced planting of early rice does not mean reduced production, drought must also ensure a bumper harvest," calling on the people of the entire region to strive to achieve the original leap forward targets. To this end, they more deeply mobilized the masses, organized the masses, added new measures not included in the original plan, actively summarized and promoted new advanced experiences, and more fully explored the potential for increased production to make up for disaster losses. In this way, they will be able to strive for the best harvest under conditions of natural disaster, and even reach the original targets.
    But there may also be another situation: Some comrades, when production is proceeding smoothly, are also very motivated; but when they encounter natural disasters, their emotions fluctuate, and they only see the losses and difficulties caused by the disaster, and cannot sufficiently estimate the favorable factors for overcoming the disaster, especially the factor of "people." These comrades may have originally thought that the problem of right-leaning conservative thinking had long been resolved, but in fact, in the depths of their minds, they still retain a piece of ground for this kind of thinking, and their minds have not been completely liberated. So when difficulties come, they want to easily lower the targets and surrender to natural forces. In order to overcome natural disasters, all localities should help these comrades to thoroughly liberate their minds, so that they can increase their confidence, actively participate in the struggle against natural disasters, and strive to move forward.
    There will also be another kind of people, who are full of right-leaning conservative thinking, lack revolutionary fighting will, and originally deny the possibility of a great leap forward in production. When they encounter natural disasters, they do not actively overcome the disasters, and when they fail to achieve the production increase targets, they come out and make sarcastic remarks, showing that they have "foresight." The thinking of this kind of people must be resolutely criticized in order to clear the way for overcoming natural disasters. These people should be made to realize one thing: Any attack by natural disasters can only temper and promote the revolutionary will of the progressives, and can never save the bankruptcy of right-leaning conservative thinking! Even if the fighting people cannot fully achieve the original targets, it does not prove the correctness of those "onlookers" and "tide-watchers." The correct ones are still the fighting people. Because they have made subjective efforts and strived for the best possible results. This is beneficial to the people and to the socialist cause.
    Every major natural disaster is a test of people's revolutionary will and revolutionary qualities. Everyone who is determined to be a revolutionary progressive forever should be able to withstand this test in the face of natural disasters.

　　在灾害面前
  　田连阡
    在争取农业生产大跃进的时候，能有个风调雨顺之年，是再好不过了。可是，在人类还不能够“呼风唤雨”、完全控制自然以前，“天老爷”总是会来跟我们捣乱的。或大或小的自然灾害，差不多年年都有。所以我们就不能把农业生产大跃进设想得那么顺利。
    在自然灾害袭来的时候，我们应当怎样呢？这里可能有几种不同的情形。一种情形，是组织广大人民，全力反击自然界敌人的袭击，用一切方法减少损失，坚持原来的农业生产跃进指标。今年遭受了三十年来所没有的大旱的河北省，就是走的这条道路。他们在干旱面前奋起作战，保持了极其旺盛的士气，而且抗旱斗争的火力愈来愈炽烈，口号是“无雨也要保丰收”！“坚决拿到八十亿（小麦）”！他们的战斗部署不只是应付今年的干旱，而且是要经过根治河流、挖掘利用地下水源等重大措施，争取从根本上消灭旱涝灾害。他们集中了数千万革命人民的战斗意志，发挥了数千万人民的智慧和创造力，全力投入战斗，要把坏事变成好事。可以预期，他们今年的水利建设将取得更大的成就。广西僮族自治区今春也发生了大旱，使早稻减少了几百万亩。但他们也没有自馁。自治区领导机关提出了“早稻减种不减产，天旱也要保丰收”的战斗口号，号召全区人民为实现原定跃进指标而奋斗。为此，他们更深入地发动群众，组织群众，增加原计划中所没有的新措施，积极总结和推广新的先进经验，更充分地发掘增产潜力，弥补受灾损失。这样，他们就能够争取到天灾条件下最好的收成，甚至达到原定指标。
    但是也可能有另外一种情形：有一些同志，当着生产一帆风顺地进行的时候，他们也很有干劲；可是一遇上自然灾害，他们就情绪波动，只看到灾害所造成的损失和困难，不能足够地估计战胜灾害的有利因素，特别是“人”的因素。这些同志原来可能自以为右倾保守思想的问题早就解决了，然而实际上在他们的思想深处仍然保有这种思想的一块阵地，他们的思想还没有完全解放。所以困难一来，就想轻易地降低指标，对自然力甘拜下风。为了战胜自然灾害，各地应当帮助这些同志彻底解放思想，使他们提高信心，积极投入对自然灾害的斗争，力争上游。
    还会有另外一种人，他们满脑子右倾保守思想，缺少革命的战斗意志，本来就否认生产大跃进的可能性，遇到自然灾害，他们不去积极战胜灾害，达不到增产指标，他们反而出来说风凉话，显示自己有“先见之明”。对于这种人的思想，必须坚决给以批判，才能为战胜自然灾害扫清道路。应该使这些人认清一点：任何自然灾害的袭击，只能锻炼促进派的革命意志，而决不能挽救右倾保守思想的破产！战斗着的人们即使不能完全达到原定指标，也并不能证明那些“观战者”“观潮者”的正确。正确的还是战斗的人们。因为他们尽了主观的努力，争得了可能的最好的成绩。这是对人民对社会主义事业有利的。
    每一次重大的自然灾害，都是对人们的革命意志和革命品质的考验。每一个立志永远做革命促进派的人，都应该在自然灾害前面经得起这种考验。
