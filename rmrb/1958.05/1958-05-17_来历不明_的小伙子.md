　　"Unknown Origin" Young Man
　　One holiday afternoon, the security team at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site received a report. The report said that there was a person of unknown origin at the construction site, neither a member of the agricultural cooperative nor a member of the voluntary labor team, but as soon as he arrived at the construction site, he started carrying earth with the others.
　　Before long, a young man of short stature, wearing a blue cotton uniform, walked into the security team's office.
　　"Where are you from?"
　　"Beijing."
　　"Which unit do you work for?"
　　"Beijing Machinery Factory."
　　"What's your name?"
　　"Chen Wanshui."
　　"What are you doing here?"
　　"Building the reservoir."
　　It turned out that this young man was a worker from Beijing, a member of the Communist Youth League. He was encouraged by the booming situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and always wanted to contribute to farmland irrigation. So, taking advantage of a two-day vacation, he got on a bus without even taking his luggage and came to the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. Red flags were flying everywhere on the construction site, countless lines of earth carriers, strings of dump trucks running on crisscrossing tracks, and the roar of the tractor groups on the dam foundation echoed through the valley. This magnificent scene made him very excited. He asked an old farmer for a pair of baskets and started carrying earth. At first, people thought he was a reporter or a cadre; but he didn't say a word for a long time. People began to suspect, and after some questioning, they found out that he had nothing to do with the construction site. After understanding the situation, the security team prepared accommodation for him.
　　His shoulders were swollen, and his hands were broken, but he worked harder and harder. When it got dark, others advised him to rest, but he refused. He said:
　　"I'm going to work overtime tonight." Finally, under everyone's repeated persuasion, he had to leave the construction site temporarily. The next day, as soon as it dawned, he appeared on the scene again.
　　The two-day holiday quickly ended. Chen Wanshui left the construction site reluctantly. But his moving deeds are circulating on the construction site.

　　“来历不明”的小伙子
    一个假日的下午，十三陵水库工地的保卫组接到了一个报告。报告说工地上有个来历不明的人，既不是农业社社员，也不是义务劳动队队员，可是他一来到工地，就跟人们一起挑土。
    工夫不大，一个身材不高、穿一身蓝色棉制服的年青人走进了保卫组办公室。
    “你是从哪儿来的？”
    “北京。”
    “在哪个单位工作？”
    “北京机械厂。”
    “叫什么名字？”
    “陈琬水。”
    “到这儿来作什么？”
    “修水库。”
    这个小伙子原来是北京的工人，共青团员。他为农村生产大跃进轰轰烈烈的情况所鼓舞，老想也为农田水利化贡献一分力量。于是，趁休假两天的机会，连行李也没带，就上了汽车，来到了十三陵水库工地。工地上到处飘扬着红旗，数不清的担土工人的行列，一串串的斗车在纵横交错的轨道上奔跑，坝基上的拖拉机群发出震撼山谷的吼声。这宏伟壮丽的场景，使他十分兴奋。他向一个老农民要了一付筐挑起土来。起初，人们以为他是个记者或是干部；可是他干了半天也不吭声。人们开始怀疑起来，一盘问，才知道他跟工地没有半点关系。保卫组了解了这些情况以后，就给他准备了住处。
    他的肩膀磨肿了，手碰破了，还是越干越有劲。天黑了，别人劝他休息，他不肯。他说：
  “晚上我还加班呢。”最后在大伙的一再劝说下，他才不得不暂时离开工地。第二天天刚亮，他又出现在现场上了。
    两天的假期很快就满了。陈琬水恋恋不舍地离开工地。但是他的动人事迹却在工地上流传着。
