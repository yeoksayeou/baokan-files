　　Happy Events in the Art World
　　Art is created by the people, and art should serve the people. The fact that eleven Shanghai traditional Chinese painters have created more than a hundred pieces of arts and crafts after working in an enamel factory is a happy event in the art world.
　　Art originally arose and developed with production and labor. The exploiting classes, for their own enjoyment, monopolized art. For thousands of years, it was either scholar-officials creating court art for imperial use, or idle literati creating "art for art's sake" to help the wealthy. Today, it is the world of the people, and art should serve the people.
　　Last spring, when dark clouds were churning in the Chinese sky, the right-wing elements in Shanghai's art circles, under the pretext of letting traditional Chinese painting workers paint sandalwood fans, created the so-called "sandalwood fan incident," stirring up trouble and causing a great commotion. In the year since then, through the anti-Rightist struggle and the double-anti movement, artists have begun to realize that if art does not serve the broad masses of the people, it will serve a small number of exploiting classes. In this great upsurge of socialist construction, they should step out of the "ivory tower," go to factories, to the countryside, and to the streets, and combine art with production and with the working people.
　　Shanghai's traditional Chinese painters have already begun to embark on this path, and artists in music, drama, fine arts, and other fields in various places have also successively moved in this direction. The Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe performs for the broad masses in the streets, and famous musicians Yu Yixuan and Lang Yuxiu sing in teahouses and at flower shows. Many other literary and art workers have also put down their airs and brought art to the doorsteps of workers, peasants, and soldiers. These small-scale operas, folk songs, or plastic arts and crafts, which are popular with the masses, have been welcomed by the broad masses. It can be expected that the flowers of art, together with the flowers of production and labor of the broad working people, will bloom all over the socialist paradise of the motherland.

### 艺术界的喜事

    艺术界的喜事
    人民创造了艺术，艺术应当为人民服务。上海十一位国画家在下了搪瓷厂以后，已经创作了一百多幅工艺美术作品，这是艺术界的喜事。
    艺术原是随着生产、随着劳动而产生、发展的。剥削阶级为了自己的享受，垄断了艺术。几千年来，不是士大夫为御用而作宫庭艺术，就是无聊文人为帮闲而“为艺术而艺术”。今天，已是人民的天下，艺术应当为人民服务。
    去年春天，当黑云翻腾在中国天空的时候，上海艺术界的右派分子却借口让国画工作者去画檀香扇，制造了所谓“檀香扇事件”，兴风作浪，闹得满城风雨。一年以来，经过反右派斗争和双反运动，艺术家们已经开始觉醒到艺术不为广大人民服务，就为少数剥削阶级服务。在这伟大的社会主义建设高潮中，应当走出“象牙之塔”，到工厂、到农村、到街头去，把艺术同生产、同劳动人民结合起来。
    上海国画家们已经开始踏上这条途径，各地音乐、戏剧、美术等方面的艺术家们也已先后走向这一方向。杭州越剧团到街头为广大群众演唱，著名音乐家喻宜萱、郎毓秀下茶社、花会歌唱，还有许许多多的文艺工作者也都放下架子，把艺术送到工农兵的门上。这些为群众所喜闻乐见的小型歌剧、民歌或是造型艺术和工艺美术等，都受到了广大群众的欢迎。可以预期，艺术之花，将同广大劳动人民的生产劳动之花，开遍祖国的社会主义乐园。
