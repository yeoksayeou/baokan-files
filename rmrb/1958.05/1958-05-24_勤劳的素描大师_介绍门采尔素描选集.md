The 19th-century German painting master, Menzel, was a very diligent painter. Throughout his life's work, he not only depicted major events of an era but also extensively portrayed the various things he encountered. In his hands, an ordinary object could be given an unforgettable impression and artistic brilliance.

The one hundred and ninety sketches in this collection were all exhibited in China in 1956. This is only a small part of his sketches, but we can see how much he loved laborers and cared about the lives of ordinary people. When Menzel's enormous influence led even the rulers of the time to award him medals and titles, he still carefully protected his independent personality as an ordinary person and faced the broad masses of the people. Menzel's "Steel Rolling Mill Workers" was one of the earliest works with heavy industrial workers as its subject matter. The image of 19th-century industrial workers in his pen is so strong and powerful, appropriately expressing the strength and temperament of the working class. He praised labor, believing that labor is a method of greatly exerting human power. This understanding and viewpoint were very rare and valuable for artists at that time.

Menzel treated life with intense enthusiasm and keen observation. He created typical artistic images of life through this very delicate and profound observation. He was good at portraying people's mental states unintentionally, just as people say, "Menzel's sketches are fascinating and are the whispers of real life." For example, the twenty-third sketch in the collection depicts a person relying on his whetting experience and finger sensitivity to test the edge of a knife; the eighty-second sketch depicts a nearsighted person reading a book. Although they are all details and fragments of life, they are such profound characterizations, and this kind of expression is precisely where the charm of artistic works lies. Menzel's sketches vividly illustrate that only through this kind of meticulous observation and typical depiction can the generalization of artistic expression be overcome. Menzel used this method to explore the mysteries of people's spiritual lives and to explore the human soul.

Throughout his life, in addition to other creations, Menzel created more than 7,000 known sketches, with a very wide range of subjects. He worked feverishly. In various different occasions, people could often find Menzel concentrating on drawing sketches. He used this tireless labor to capture those elusive moments in life; even with just a few strokes, he took a very serious and conscientious attitude. After reading his sketch collection, it is not difficult to understand why he could become such a master of creating artistic images with skilled techniques. (Image attached)

    勤劳的素描大师
    ——介绍门采尔素描选集
    邵宇
    德国十九世纪绘画大师门采尔，是一位十分勤劳的画家。在他一生的创作中，既描写了一个时代的重大事件，同时也广泛的描写了他接触的各种事物。在他的笔下，能把一个普通对象，赋与令人难忘的印象和艺术光辉。
    这本选集中的一百九十幅素描，都是1956年在我国展览过的。这只是他素描的一小部分，但我们也可以看到他是多么热爱劳动者和关怀普通人的生活。当门采尔由于其创作的巨大影响，使当时统治者也不能不授予他勋章和称号的时候，他仍小心的保护着自己做为一个平常人的独立人格而面向着广大人民。门采尔创作的轧钢工人，是一幅最早的以重工业工人为题材的作品，在他笔下的十九世纪产业工人的形象，是那么坚强有力，恰当的表现了工人阶级的力量和气质。他歌颂劳动，他认为：劳动是大量施展人类力量的方法。这种认识和观点，对当时的艺术家来说，是非常难得和宝贵的。
    门采尔以非常强烈的热情和敏锐的观察力来对待生活。透过他这种非常细腻深刻的观察，来创造生活里的典型艺术形象。他善于在人们的无意中把他的精神状态刻划出来，正如人们所说的：“门采尔的素描是引人入神的和现实生活的窃窃私语”。例如画集中第二十三幅是描写一个依靠他的磨刀经验和手指敏感来检验刀锋的人；第八十二幅则是描写一个近视眼在看书。虽然都是生活的细节和片断，但又是多么深刻的形象刻划，而这种表现，活活是艺术作品的魅力所在。门采尔的素描生动的说明了：只有通过这种细致观察的典型描写，才能克服艺术表现上的一般化，门采尔正是通过这种方法来发掘着人们精神生活的奥秘，探求着人的灵魂。
    门采尔一生中，除其他创作外，创作的素描，已经知道的就有七千多张，题材非常的广泛，他狂热的进行着创作劳动，在各种不同场合中，人们常常可以发现门采尔在精力集中的画着素描，他就是用这种不知疲劳的劳动，到处去捕捉那些生活中令人难以捉摸的一刹那；即或是寥寥几笔，他都采取非常严肃认真的态度，看了他的素描集，不难明白为什么他可以成为那样一个具有熟练技巧的创造艺术形象的巨匠。（附图片）
