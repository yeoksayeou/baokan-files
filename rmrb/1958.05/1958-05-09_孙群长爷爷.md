Column: Songs of the Great Leap Forward

    Yesterday I got home, and many commune members came to see me in the evening. Half the night was spent in joyful conversation. They enthusiastically praised the Party's policy of sending cadres to lower levels; they also spoke about the hardworking spirit of the cadres sent down to such and such a village, and joked about the stories that happened to the intellectuals who had just arrived in the countryside.
    "Oh, and my apprentice," Grandpa Sun, the production team leader, raised his voice, suppressing the voices of everyone in the room, "don't even mention how funny it is: a few days ago, when we were debating with Gu Yuheng, I mentioned that I only had one cow leg when I was young. After the meeting, he quietly asked me: 'Grandpa Sun, can your one-legged cow work?' When I heard him say that, I couldn't stop laughing. The young man's face turned red. I said: 'It's not a one-legged cow, it's feeding a cow four times – that's what it means to have one cow leg.' After he understood, he rubbed his face and said: 'Oh, that means you have a quarter of a cow.' The young man was very happy to have learned a farming term. He didn't mind me laughing at him."
    Grandpa Sun, the old man, is very experienced in growing crops. He inherited rich experience from his father, and he has also devoted himself to careful research throughout his life; it can be said that his precious years have been completely devoted to wheat, millet and sorghum... In the past, whenever spring rains fell, or when the autumn wind first rose, people would go to him to ask for advice. However, he would say: "Farming is for the foolish: lots of manure and diligent watering, no need to ask anyone; early planting has its advantages, and late planting also gets some benefit, there is no fixed rule." In fact, in his heart, there were different measures to be taken for spring planting and autumn harvesting, depending on the amount of rain and the earliness or lateness of the seasons. But he was unwilling to tell others his ideas, or unwilling to tell them completely. He now "confesses" the reason. He said: "People's hearts are different from before. In the past, my heart was terrible: I was unwilling to help others. Why? It was for my own good. For example, if everyone had a good harvest, then the grain would be cheap. Needless to say, you would also suffer."
    "Grandpa, how is Lu Fei learning these days?" League Branch Secretary Gu Zhenhai asked with concern.
    Grandpa continued with enthusiasm:
    "The young man's heart couldn't be clearer. Like window paper, it breaks with a touch. The first time he asked me about farm work, I first told him about the Twenty-Four Solar Terms. He wrote it down in his notebook and put it in his pocket. I said to him without being polite: 'It's not enough to just write it down in a notebook, you also need to remember it in your heart. For example, when you can't sleep at night, think about farm work, do you have to turn on the light, put on your clothes, and rummage through the boxes and cabinets to find that notebook?' He listened to me, and memorized the Twenty-Four Solar Terms in one night. The Twenty-Four Solar Terms are not smooth to say, don't rhyme, and are not connected, they are not easy to remember!"
    Grandpa Sun was just about to stop talking when primary school teacher Li Huanwen asked another question:
    "When do you think Lu Fei will graduate?"
    "In the past few months, he has almost emptied all the stuff in my belly."
    "Then he should be given a diploma!"
    "No, no. As the saying goes: you can't learn all the farm work in less than a year. Besides, if he graduates, we both have to graduate together. I will teach him how to hold a hoe and sickle, how to plow, sow, hoe and harvest, and he will teach me how to write and... scientific knowledge. Lu Fei has a lot of good stuff in his belly: there is 'nitrogen', there is 'phosphorus', and there is 'potassium'; he also has soil science and meteorology. His heart is really like a small grocery store. I must buy some wholesale..."
    "Forget it, you're so old, you still want to be frivolous!" Gu Junxiu, who often joked with him, threw a pot of cold water at him.
    "Junxiu, don't think I'm old. A broken crock can outlast your cypress bucket! We don't know who will lift who."
    In fact, he is already sixty-five years old. But he is strong, his back is not bent, he doesn't hunch, he is not deaf, and his eyes are not blurred. In his own words, "everything is good, "even my fingernails are harder than others'."
    In the first year after the elementary cooperative was established, I went home twice. Every time I went home, he would ask me to talk to him and ask about the policies. At that time, he had not joined the cooperative, and he often asked me with a worried expression:
  "Is joining the cooperative forced, or is it voluntary?" And also: "I want a nephew to be adopted to me, does the higher level allow it?" That year was the first time I saw him wearing a leather robe: gray cloth surface, curly fluff exposed in a circle under the front and back lapels; his right hand also held a cane, his left hand behind his back; he spoke incoherently, and when listening to others, he wanted to put his ears on their mouths, asking loudly: "What did you say?"... At that time, the impression he gave was that he was indeed old, and he was getting old very quickly.
    At the advanced cooperative establishment conference in the spring of the year before last, I heard that he suddenly took the stage to speak at the end. His every word shocked and excited people! He said to the villagers: "I, Sun Qunzhang, have fallen behind. I only understood the meaning of cooperation today. I am a childless old man, and I am afraid of giving my things to the cooperative, and the two old people have no one to serve them. I want to keep these ten acres of land, keep this cow, and find an adopted son to take care of me in my old age. I was afraid of being pulled into the cooperative, and the cooperative asked me to be a 'technical shareholder', I had to agree, but I didn't dare to be too enthusiastic... Now I understand everything: the cooperative is good, I won't say more about the benefits here. Today I joined the cooperative, I hand over the land, the old cow, and the big cart to the cooperative, and I also hand myself over to the cooperative! I'm not looking for an adopted son anymore, all of you young people are my own children." The sound of his voice was louder than before, and the people under the stage stared at him with their eyes wide open.
    "...After I can't climb anymore, you won't refuse to carry me a load of water to drink."
    "We'll take care of you!"
    "When we get to socialism, we'll build tap water to your electric stove!"
    The young men and women under the stage shouted so happily.
    "...Don't be afraid that I'll be half-dead and exhaust you, no, at least I can work for socialism for another ten years. This old look of mine is all to deceive you." As he spoke, he threw the cane in his hand onto the nearby house and took off his spring fur coat. His waist straightened up again.
    Unfortunately, I was far away from my hometown that year, if I had been there, I would have clapped my hands until they were red and swollen.
    After a burst of laughter in the room, Grandpa Sun continued to challenge Gu Junxiu: "Junxiu, didn't you say I'm old? During the Great Leap Forward, let's have a challenge. This year, my apprentice and I have already planned to create a high yield of 1,500 catties of spring corn. Do you dare to accept the challenge?"
    Everyone in the room cheered in unison: "Junxiu, accept it!"
    "You're the captain, can you still back down?"
    Junxiu said: "I don't dare. When this old farmer and intellectual combine, 2,000 catties are possible."
    Grandpa Sun was a little relieved when he heard this: "I guess you wouldn't dare. After we create experience for you this year, you can plant spring corn next year. Young people, don't be too reckless."

专栏：跃进之歌

    孙群长爷爷
    谷峪
    昨天到家，夜晚有许多社员来看我。半夜的工夫，都是在欢乐的交谈当中度过了。他们热情地赞扬党的干部下放政策的英明；他们还介绍着下放到某某村的干部那吃苦耐劳的精神，又说笑着初到农村来的知识分子所发生的故事。
    “噢，还有我那个徒弟，”孙群长爷爷大起嗓子，压住满屋子人的声音，“甭提多逗乐了：前几天咱们和谷玉衡辩论的时候，我提到我年轻时只有一条牛腿。散会以后他悄悄地问我：‘孙大爷，你那一条腿的牛能干活吗？’我听了他的话，叫我这个笑哟。把小伙子的脸都笑红了。我说：‘不是一条腿的牛，是一头牛四家伙喂着——这就叫有一条牛腿。’他明白了以后，搓了一下脸说：‘噢，那是你有四分之一的牛。’小伙子了解到一句庄稼话以后，可高兴啦。他没有嫌我笑他。”
    孙群长老头子，对种庄稼是老有经验的。他从父亲那里接受了丰富经验，自己的一生也是苦心钻研；可以说，他一生宝贵的年华完全贡献给了小麦、谷子和高粱……在从前，每逢春雨下过，或者是秋风乍起的时候，人们都到他那里去讨教。但是，他却说：“庄稼活是笨汉子活，粪大雨勤，不用问人；早种有得意的，晚种也有沾光的，没有一定之规。”其实在他心里，春种秋收，根据雨水大小，节令的迟早，是有不同的措施的。但他的主意不肯告诉别人，或者是不肯完全告诉别人。这种原因，他现在“坦白”出来。他说：“人的心和从前不同了。从前，我的心就要不得的：不愿意帮助别人。为的什么呢？为的是自己好。比方说，大家都丰收，那粮食就贱了。不用说，你也就跟着吃亏。”
    “爷爷，这些日子路非学得怎样啊？”团支书谷振海关心地问。
    爷爷就兴致勃勃地说下去：
    “小伙子的心，那是再透亮没有了。像窗纸，一点就破。头一次他问我农活上的事。我先告诉了他二十四节。他记在本子上，装在兜里去。我就不客气地和他说：‘光记在本子上不顶用，还要记在心里。比方，夜晚睡不着觉的时候，盘算盘算农活，莫非还得点上灯，穿上衣裳，翻箱倒柜把那本子找出来？’他听了我的话，一个晚上就把二十四节背熟了。二十四节，不顺嘴、不押韵，又不连接，不好记哪！”
    孙群长爷爷刚要把话收住，小学教师李焕文又提问了一句：
    “你看路非什么时候能毕业？”
    “几个月来，我肚子里这点玩意快让他掏净了。”
    “那就该发给人家文凭了呀！”
    “不行不行。常言说：不到一年，庄稼活学不全。再说，要毕业我们俩得一齐毕。我教会他拿锄拿镰、耕耩锄割，他要教会我提笔写字，还有那……科学知识。路非肚子里，好东西多着哪：有‘氮’、有‘磷’、还有‘钾’；他还有土质学、气象学。他心里真像一座小杂货铺。我一定要趸他点……”
    “算了吧，那么大年纪了，还想风流风流呢！”和他常开玩笑的谷俊秀把一瓢冷水向他泼去。
    “俊秀，你别看我上了年纪。破瓦罐能熬你的柏木筲！咱们俩还不知谁抬上谁喽呢。”
    实在，论年岁，他已经六十五岁了。但是身子骨结实，前不弯、后不驼，耳不聋、眼不花。用他自己的话说，“各地方都是好的，“连指甲长的都比别人的硬”。
    初级社刚成立的那一年，我回过两次家。每次到家时，他都找我去谈谈心，打听打听政策。那时他没有入社，经常愁眉不展地问我：
  “入社是强迫呀，还是自愿呢？”再就是：“我想要一个侄子给我过继，上级允许不呢？”那年是我第一次见他穿上皮长袍：灰色布面，卷曲的绒毛在前后大襟的下边露出一圈；他的右手也拄起了拐杖，左手背在身后；说话前言不答后语，听别人的话都想把耳朵放在人家的嘴巴上，大声问着：“你说的是什么？”……那个时候，给人的印象，他确乎是老了，而且很快的就这样老了。
    在前年春天的高级社成立大会上，我听说，最后他忽然登台讲话了。他的每句话都使人震惊和兴奋！他向乡亲们说：“我孙群长落后了。合作化的意思到今天我才明白过来。我是一个绝户头子，怕把东西归了社，老俩口子没人侍候。我想留下这十几亩地，留下这牛，找一个过继儿子，把我养老送终。我怕拉我入社，社里请我当‘技术股’，我不得不答应，可又不敢太热火儿。……现在一切我都看明了：合作社好，好处在这里我不多说。我今天参加了社，把土地、老牛、大车都交给社，也把我交给社！我也不找过继儿了，你们年轻的都是我的亲儿女。”他说话的声音，比已往还要洪亮，台下人都直瞪起眼睛望着他。
    “……等我爬不动了以后，你们不会不担给我挑子水吃。”
    “我们包下你！”
    “到了社会主义，把自来水修到你那电炉子上去！”
    台子下边的青年男女，这样兴高彩烈地喊着。
    “……不要怕我半死不活的吃累你们，不，顶少我还能为社会主义干十年。我这老样子都是装给你们看的。”说着他把手中的拐杖扔到临近的房上去，把春天的大皮袄也脱下来。他的腰板又挺得直直的了。
    可惜的是那年我远离故乡，如果我在场的话，我会为他拍的两只手掌红肿起来。
    屋子里一阵欢笑过去，孙群长爷爷继续向谷俊秀叫阵：“俊秀，你不是说我老了吗？正在跃进的时候，咱们挑个战吧。今年我和我徒弟已经计划好了：要创造春玉米高额丰产一千五百斤。敢应战吗？”
    满屋子的人齐声助阵：“俊秀，应！”
    “你是队长哩，还能后缩？”
    俊秀说：“我不敢。人家这老农和知识分子一结合，两千也可能呀。”
    孙群长爷爷听了这句话，才把火气消了一点：“估量你也不敢。等今年我们给你创出经验，明年你再种春玉米吧。年青人儿，别太冒失。”
