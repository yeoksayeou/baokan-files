    Tibet
    Seven years ago today, the plenipotentiary representatives of the Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government officially signed the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" in Beijing, proclaiming the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
    The Tibetan region is located on China's southwestern border, with an area of 1,221,600 square kilometers, accounting for 12.73% of the country's land area, and a population of approximately 1.2 million, the vast majority of whom are Tibetan.
    Tibet has abundant resources. Preliminary surveys show that there are more than 30 kinds of minerals with economic value, including iron ore and coal; refractory materials and building materials.
    According to the results of the Tibet Forest Survey Team of the Ministry of Forestry in 1956, Tibet is rich in forest resources, and the total forest reserves are comparable to the Fujian forest area, which is rich in timber. Among them, spruce, fir, birch, maple, and lacquer trees all have high economic value.
    Tibet has a lot of arable land. Even in the Ali area in the west, the banks of the Kongque River, which is about 4,000 meters above sea level, are full of farmland. The wide valley areas of the Yarlung Zangbo River and its tributaries, the Lhasa River and the Nyang River, have fertile land and a mild climate, making them areas with great potential for agricultural development.
    Tibet's main pastoral areas are distributed on the northern Tibetan plateau, covering about two-thirds of the entire plateau. The main types of livestock are yaks, hybrid yaks, and goats, followed by horses. With the development of construction, Tibet will become one of the motherland's animal husbandry bases.
    Based on the actual situation in Tibet, the central government decided not to carry out democratic reforms in Tibet during the Second Five-Year Plan period. In 1952, when Chairman Mao met with representatives of the Tibetan tribute delegation, he said: "The Communist Party practices ethnic equality and does not oppress or exploit you, but helps you; helps you develop the population, develop the economy and culture. The People's Liberation Army enters Tibet to implement the policy of helping you."
    In the past few years, the state has done its best to help Tibet develop its economy and carry out construction. It has successively invested directly in the construction of the Kangzang Highway and the Qingzang Highway, as well as the highways from Lhasa to Shigatse, Shigatse to Gyantse, and Gyantse to Yadong. By the end of last year, there were more than 6,000 kilometers of highways in the Tibetan region.
    In May 1956, the first leader aircraft flying from Beijing to Lhasa crossed the "air restricted zone" and arrived in Lhasa, opening up the air route from Beijing to Tibet.
    The state provides interest-free and low-interest loans to agriculture and animal husbandry in the Tibetan region, which has played a significant role in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry. By 1956, the People's Bank of China had issued 1.386 million yuan in interest-free and low-interest agricultural, animal husbandry, and handicraft loans.
    After liberation, Tibet's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed greatly. Seventy-eight primary schools have been established in various places, with more than 6,000 students. Their food, clothing, books, and pocket money are all provided by the state. In 1957, the first middle school in Tibetan history was established in Lhasa. In 1957, there were 22 medical and health institutions in the region. Three people's hospitals with complete technical equipment were established in Lhasa, Shigatse, and Qamdo, as well as 17 health centers (stations). (Attached picture)

    西藏
    七年前的今天，中央人民政府和西藏地方政府的全权代表在北京正式签订了“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”，宣告西藏和平解放。
    西藏地区位于我国西南边疆，面积一百二十二万一千六百平方公里，占全国土地面积的12.73％，人口约一百二十万，其中绝大多数是藏族。
    西藏有丰富资源，据初步勘察，有三十多种有经济价值的矿产，其中包括铁矿、煤矿；耐火材料和建筑材料。
    据中央林业部西藏森林踏查组1956年踏查的结果，证明西藏蕴藏着丰富的森林资源，森林总蓄积量可与盛产木材的福建林区相比。其中云杉、冷杉、桦木、械树、漆树都有很高的经济价值。
    西藏有许多可耕地，即在西部阿里地区，拔海四千公尺左右的孔雀河两岸，到处都是农田。雅鲁藏布江和它的支流拉萨河、年楚河的宽谷区，土地肥沃，气候温和，是农业很有发展前途的地区。
    西藏的主要牧区分布在藏北高原，面积约占整个高原的三分之二。牲畜种类以牦牛、绵牛和山羊为主，马匹次之。随着建设事业的发展，西藏将成为祖国畜牧业基地之一。
    根据西藏地区的实际情况，中央决定西藏在第二个五年计划期间不进行民主改革。1952年毛主席接见西藏致敬团的代表时，就说过：“共产党实行民族平等，不要压迫、剥削你们，而是要帮助你们；帮助你们发展人口、发展经济和文化。人民解放军进入西藏就是要执行帮助你们的政策。”
    几年来，国家在可能条件下尽量帮助西藏发展经济，进行建设。先后直接投资修筑康藏公路、青藏公路，拉萨到日喀则、日喀则到江孜、江孜到亚东的公路，到去年底为止，西藏地区的公路已有六千多公里。
    1956年5月间，第一架从北京通航拉萨的领队机，越过“空中禁区”，飞抵拉萨，开辟了北京到西藏的航线。
    国家对西藏地区的农、牧业进行无利和低利贷款，对农、牧业的发展起了很大作用。到1956年为止，中国人民银行发放一百三十八万六千元的无利和低利农、牧、手工业贷款。
    解放后，西藏的文教卫生事业也有很大的发展，各地先后已建立了七十八所小学，共有学生六千多名，他们的伙食、服装、书籍和零用杂费都由国家供给。1957年，在拉萨创办了西藏历史上第一所中学。1957年全区已有二十二个医疗卫生机构，在拉萨、日喀则、昌都设立了三个技术设备完善的人民医院，还有十七个卫生院（所）。（附图片）
