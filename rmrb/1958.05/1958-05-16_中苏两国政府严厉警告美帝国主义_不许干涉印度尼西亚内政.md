Xinhua News Agency, May 15th—Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China
                                     May 15, 1958
    Recently, U.S. imperialism has adopted more blatant methods to support Indonesian rebels, intensifying and expanding its illegal interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. Facts revealed from all sides show that the United States is continuously transporting various light and heavy weapons, fighter planes, and aircraft fuel to the rebel forces entrenched in North Sulawesi through Taiwan, the Chinese territory it occupies, and territories of other countries adjacent to Indonesia; the United States is also directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to send military and intelligence personnel to directly participate in the rebel forces' military operations and subversive activities; U.S.-made aircraft piloted by Americans and Chiang Kai-shek clique members are indiscriminately bombing several eastern regions of Indonesian territory. This U.S. act of openly infringing upon the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia and rudely interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs constitutes a serious violation of all recognized international principles. In his statement on April 30, 1958, Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda pointed out that this interference contains factors endangering peace in Asia and the world and will have very broad consequences in international relations. China has always been concerned about and actively safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, and as a friendly neighbor of Indonesia, the Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot but feel great concern about the increasingly serious situation in Indonesia and Asia caused by this outrageous behavior of U.S. imperialism.
    As is well known, the rebel "government" that appeared in Central Sumatra in February 1958 was established under the behind-the-scenes manipulation and active support of U.S. imperialism. The arrogant attempt of U.S. imperialism is to subvert the legitimate government of Indonesia through this rebellion, suppress the Indonesian people's movement to safeguard national independence and oppose colonialism, thereby re-imposing colonial shackles on the Indonesian people, and further打击the burgeoning national independence movement in Asia and Africa. However, U.S. imperialism greatly underestimated the Indonesian people's determination to safeguard national sovereignty and independence, and it also insufficiently estimated the firm support of the Asian and African people and peace-loving countries and people around the world for the Indonesian people. The divisive and subversive activities planned by U.S. imperialism in Indonesia were resolutely countered by the Indonesian government and people from the very beginning, and the rebellion in Sumatra was declared bankrupt in just a few dozen days. Now, U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept its failure and is even gathering some of its followers and using the Chiang Kai-shek clique to support the rebels entrenched in North Sulawesi in a more blatant manner, and it is wantonly slandering the Indonesian government and people in an attempt to create excuses for further large-scale interference. This heinous and wicked bandit behavior of the United States is not only an open provocation to the Indonesian people but also a serious challenge to the Bandung Conference principles and world peace. It has aroused great indignation among the peace-loving people of Indonesia and the world. Now Indonesian President Sukarno has warned imperialism not to play with fire in Indonesia, representing the will of all Indonesian people. Many Asian and African governments and the broad masses of Asian and African people have also successively expressed strong condemnation and protests against the illegal interference of U.S. imperialism and its followers. Obviously, in a world where peace forces have grown unprecedentedly strong, the anti-colonialist movement of the Asian and African people has flourished, and the imperialist plots of aggression and interference in the Asian and African regions have been severely打击time and time again, all the conspiratorial activities carried out by U.S. imperialism in Indonesia will inevitably meet with a shameful failure.
    The Chinese government has long sternly condemned the illegal interference of U.S. imperialism in Indonesia. Now, the Chinese government believes it is necessary to emphasize the seriousness of the situation caused by the United States' increasingly blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs by using Taiwan, the Chinese territory it occupies, as a base and the Chiang Kai-shek clique as a tool. The continued development of this situation will inevitably lead to very dangerous consequences. The Chinese government and people fully support the Indonesian government and people's just struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and independence and oppose imperialist interference. The Chinese government has supplied the Indonesian government with cotton cloth and rice in the form of loans; the Chinese government is also prepared to provide assistance to the Indonesian government within its capabilities. We firmly believe that the Indonesian people's struggle to safeguard national independence and oppose U.S. interference will surely achieve victory with the support of the Asian and African people and all peace-loving and just countries and people around the world. If the United States does not immediately stop its interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, it will surely reap the bitter fruit of its aggression and provocation.

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th—According to TASS, Moscow: The Soviet government issued a statement on the 14th, firmly condemning and demanding the cessation of foreign interference in the affairs of the Indonesian people and their acts of aggression against the sovereignty of the Republic of Indonesia. The statement pointed out that these foreign powers must bear full responsibility for the dangerous consequences caused by their actions in Indonesia.

The Soviet government's statement said that since the end of World War II, as a result of the national liberation movement, Indonesia and many other Asian and African countries have broken free from the shackles of colonialism and firmly embarked on the path of national independent development and economic revival. From the first day of its establishment, the Republic of Indonesia has pursued a peaceful foreign policy and actively fought to completely eliminate the remnants of the colonial system. This active and independent foreign policy has strongly hindered the plans of certain Western countries to maintain colonial exploitation of the Asian and African people and drag the countries in this region into aggressive military blocs. Therefore, for many years, Western countries have been trying to get the Republic of Indonesia to change its peaceful and independent policy and overthrow its legitimate government. In recent months, this pressure on Indonesia has intensified.

The statement pointed out that recently, imperialist groups incited anti-government rebellions in Sumatra, and they have adopted various methods to put pressure on the Indonesian government. Particularly noteworthy are the remarks of some U.S. leaders (including Secretary of State Dulles), who openly advocated the establishment of a new government in Indonesia. Judging from a series of events in Indonesia, their remarks are nothing more than direct incitement to overthrow the legitimate Indonesian government.

The statement pointed out that since last year, the council meetings held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have discussed the Indonesian situation more than once, carrying out political intimidation against the Indonesian people and government, and conspiring against the government of the Republic of Indonesia behind the backs of the Indonesian people. In addition, some Western countries have also attempted to impose a naval blockade on the Indonesian islands. In order to maintain a constant state of tension in this region and put direct pressure on Indonesia, foreign groups have also attempted to use the Indonesian territory of West Irian as a military springboard for the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization bloc against independent Asian countries. They once again hindered the adoption of a resolution on the peaceful settlement of the West Irian issue proposed by Asian and African countries at the twelfth session of the United Nations General Assembly. Recently, member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have also conducted large-scale military demonstrations off the coast of Indonesia more than once. Foreign aircraft have also attacked Indonesian cities and villages, as well as Indonesian and foreign merchant ships sailing in Indonesian territorial waters. According to many newspapers, the aforementioned aircraft use Taiwan and the Philippines as bases and are piloted by American and Chiang Kai-shek pilots, which once again proves that the U.S. ruling clique is directly involved in the rebellion against the legitimate Indonesian government.

The statement said that in the activities against Indonesia, Western imperialist groups have made large-scale use of the Chiang Kai-shek clique hiding in Taiwan. Everyone knows that the Chiang Kai-shek elements have not only actively participated in supplying weapons, ammunition, and military supplies to the rebels in Sumatra and Sulawesi, but also openly taken aggressive actions against Indonesia, such as attacking its territory with aircraft.

The statement said that it is very clear that the purpose of imperialist interference in Indonesia's internal affairs is to attempt to crush the will of the Indonesian government and people to consolidate national independence, to defend the territorial integrity of the motherland, and to maintain and strengthen peace in Southeast Asia. Some people in the participating countries of the aggressive military bloc are unwilling to recognize the profound changes taking place in Asia and still do not give up the hope of reversing the development of Indonesia and binding Indonesia's hands and feet with obligations that are beneficial to foreign imperialist groups but violate the national interests of the Indonesian people.

The statement said that the constant political, military, and economic pressure on Indonesia, attempting to force the Indonesian government to abandon its efforts to completely unify the motherland and thoroughly eliminate the consequences of colonial rule, is a violation of the principles of the United Nations Charter and a violation of the basic norms of international law. The Soviet government believes that it has a responsibility to draw attention to the serious consequences that may be caused by this policy pursued by colonial countries, which hopes to establish a hotbed that generates new tensions.

The statement said that the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by the events taking place in the Indonesian region, because the situation there seriously threatens the cause of peace.

The Soviet government firmly condemns foreign interference in the internal affairs of the Indonesian people and condemns these countries' acts of aggression against the sovereign Republic of Indonesia. The Soviet government hopes that the countries responsible for the current situation in the Indonesian region, especially the United States, can listen to the voice of reason and stop interfering in the internal affairs of the Republic of Indonesia.

The statement concluded by saying that the Soviet people and the Soviet government firmly believe that the Indonesian people will be able to victoriously overcome the temporary difficulties caused by external forces and will be able to achieve victory in the struggle for the peaceful life, independence, and economic prosperity of their motherland.

　　中苏两国政府严厉警告美帝国主义
    不许干涉印度尼西亚内政
    新华社15日讯　中华人民共和国政府声明
                                     一九五八年五月十五日
    最近，美帝国主义采取了更加露骨的方式支援印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，加紧和扩大对印度尼西亚内政的非法干涉。从各方面所揭发出来的事实表明，美国正源源不绝地把各种轻重武器、战斗机和飞机汽油通过被它霸占的中国领土台湾和邻近印度尼西亚的别国领土运送给盘踞在北苏拉威西的叛乱军队；美国并且指使蒋介石集团派遣军事和特务的人员直接参加了叛乱分子的军事行动和颠覆活动；由美国人和蒋介石集团分子所驾驶的美制飞机正在滥施轰炸印度尼西亚领土的东部若干地区。美国这种公然侵犯印度尼西亚共和国主权，粗暴干涉印度尼西亚内政的行为，构成了对一切公认的国际原则的严重破坏。印度尼西亚共和国朱安达总理在一九五八年四月三十日声明中指出这种干涉包含着危害亚洲和全世界和平的因素，它将在国际关系中产生非常广泛的后果。中国一贯关怀并且积极维护亚洲和全世界的和平，中国又是印度尼西亚的友好邻邦，对由于美帝国主义这种横行不法行为所引起的日益严重的印度尼西亚和亚洲的局势，中国政府和中国人民不能不感到极大的关切。
    众所周知，一九五八年二月间在中苏门答腊出现的叛乱“政府”就是在美帝国主义的幕后操纵和积极支持下成立的。美帝国主义的狂妄企图，就是通过这一叛乱行动，颠覆印度尼西亚的合法政府，镇压印度尼西亚人民维护民族独立和反对殖民主义的运动，从而为印度尼西亚人民重新套上殖民枷锁，进而打击风起云涌的亚非民族独立运动。然而，美帝国主义大大低估了印度尼西亚人民维护国家主权和独立的决心，也没有足够的估计亚非人民和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民对印度尼西亚人民的坚决支持。美帝国主义在印度尼西亚所策划的分裂和颠覆活动从一开始就遭到印度尼西亚政府和人民的坚决回击，苏门答腊的叛乱活动在短短的几十天里就宣告破产。现在，美帝国主义不甘心于自己的失败，竟又纠集它的一些追随者，并利用蒋介石集团，以更加露骨的方式支持盘踞在北苏拉威西的叛乱分子负隅顽抗，并且对印度尼西亚政府和人民肆行诬蔑，以图为进一步的大规模干涉制造借口。美国这种穷凶极恶的强盗行为，不仅是对印度尼西亚人民的公然挑衅，而且也是对万隆会议原则和世界和平的严重的挑衅，它已经引起了印度尼西亚和全世界爱好和平的人民的极大的愤慨。现在印度尼西亚共和国苏加诺总统已经代表全印度尼西亚人民的意志警告帝国主义不要在印度尼西亚玩火。许多亚非国家政府和广大的亚非人民，也相继对美帝国主义及其追随者的非法干涉行为表示强烈的谴责和抗议。显然，在全世界和平力量已经空前壮大、亚非人民反殖民主义运动有了蓬勃发展，帝国主义在亚非地区的侵略和干涉阴谋一次又一次遭到严重打击的今天，美帝国主义在印度尼西亚所进行的一切阴谋活动，也必将遭到可耻的失败。
    中国政府早已严厉谴责美帝国主义对印度尼西亚所进行的非法干涉行为。现在，中国政府认为有必要着重指出，美国利用它霸占的中国领土台湾作为基地和利用蒋介石集团作为工具日益粗暴地干涉印度尼西亚的内政所造成的局势的严重性。这种局势的继续发展将不可避免地引起十分危险的后果。中国政府和人民完全支持印度尼西亚政府和人民为了维护国家主权和独立、反对帝国主义干涉的正义斗争。中国政府已经用贷款的方式向印度尼西亚政府供应了棉布和大米；中国政府还准备在力所能及的范围内提供印度尼西亚政府所要求的支援。我们深信印度尼西亚人民维护民族独立、反对美国干涉的斗争在亚非人民和全世界爱好和平和正义的国家和人民的支持下，一定能获得胜利。美国如不立即停止它对印度尼西亚内政的干涉活动，必将自食其侵略和挑衅的恶果。
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府14日发表声明，坚决谴责并且要求停止外国对印度尼西亚人民事务的干涉和它们对印度尼西亚共和国主权的侵略行动。声明指出，这些外国要为它们对印度尼西亚的行动所招致的危险后果负全部责任。
    苏联政府的声明说，第二次世界大战结束以后，由于民族解放运动的结果，印度尼西亚和其他许多亚非国家挣脱了殖民主义枷锁，坚定地走上了民族独立发展和经济复兴的道路。印度尼西亚共和国从它成立的第一天起就一直奉行和平外交政策，并积极进行斗争以求彻底消除殖民主义制度的残余。这种积极的、独立的外交政策有力地阻碍了某些西方国家想维持对亚非人民的殖民剥削和把这一地区的国家拖入侵略性军事集团的计划的实现。因此，许多年来西方国家一直企图使印度尼西亚共和国改变和平的独立政策，并且推翻它的合法政府。最近几个月来，对印度尼西亚的这种压力更加加紧了。
    声明指出，最近帝国主义集团煽动了苏门答腊的反政府叛乱，它们采取各种方式对印度尼西亚政府施加压力。特别值得注意的是美国一些领导人（其中包括国务卿杜勒斯）的言论，他们明目张胆地主张在印度尼西亚建立新政府。从印度尼西亚发生的一系列事件看来，他们的言论不外就是直接唆使推翻合法的印度尼西亚政府。
    声明指出，从去年到现在，东南亚条约组织和北大西洋集团举行的理事会会议不止一次地讨论了印度尼西亚局势问题，对印度尼西亚人民和政府实行政治恫吓，背着印度尼西亚人民进行了反对印度尼西亚共和国政府的阴谋。此外，某些西方国家还企图对印度尼西亚各岛实行海上封锁。为了在这个地区保持经常的紧张局面并对印度尼西亚施加直接压力，外国集团还企图利用印度尼西亚的领土西伊里安作为东南亚条约组织集团反对亚洲独立国家的军事跳板，它们曾经在联合国大会第十二届会议上再次阻挠通过由亚非国家提出的和平解决西伊里安问题的决议案。最近，东南亚条约组织的成员国还不止一次地在印度尼西亚海岸进行大规模军事示威。外国飞机还袭击了印度尼西亚城市和乡村以及在印度尼西亚领海内航行的印度尼西亚商船和外国商船。据许多报纸报道，上述飞机以台湾和菲律宾作为基地并由美国和蒋介石的驾驶员驾驶，这再一次证明美国统治集团在直接参与反对合法的印度尼西亚政府的叛乱活动。
    声明说，在反对印度尼西亚的活动中，西方帝国主义集团大规模利用躲在台湾的蒋介石集团，大家都知道，蒋介石分子不仅积极地参加了对苏门答腊和苏拉威西的叛乱者供应武器、弹药和军需品的工作，而且公开地对印度尼西亚采取了例如用飞机袭击它的领土的侵略行动。
    声明说，非常明显，帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚内政的目的是企图摧折印度尼西亚政府和人民为巩固民族独立、为祖国领土完整、为维护和加强东南亚和平而斗争的意志。侵略性军事集团参加国的某些人士不愿意承认亚洲发生的深刻变化，而仍然不放弃想使印度尼西亚的发展倒退、想用有利于外国帝国主义集团但却违反印度尼西亚人民的民族利益的义务，把印度尼西亚的手足束缚起来的希望。
    声明说，不断对印度尼西亚施加政治、军事和经济压力，企图迫使印度尼西亚政府放弃完全统一祖国和彻底肃清殖民统治的后果的努力，这种做法是对联合国宪章的原则的蹂躏，是违反国际法的基本准则的。苏联政府认为，有责任提醒注意殖民国家所奉行的这种指望建立产生新的紧张局势的温床的政策可能引起的严重后果。
    声明说，苏联不能对印度尼西亚地区发生的事件袖手旁观，因为那里的局势严重地威胁到和平事业。
    苏联政府坚决谴责外国干涉印度尼西亚人民的内政，并谴责这些国家对自主的印度尼西亚共和国的侵略行为。苏联政府希望，应对印度尼西亚地区现在的局势负责的国家，首先是美国，能倾听理智的声音，并且停止干涉印度尼西亚共和国的内政。
    声明最后说，苏联人民和苏联政府坚信，印度尼西亚人民能够胜利地克服外力造成的暂时困难，能够在为祖国的和平生活、独立和经济繁荣而进行的斗争中取得胜利。
