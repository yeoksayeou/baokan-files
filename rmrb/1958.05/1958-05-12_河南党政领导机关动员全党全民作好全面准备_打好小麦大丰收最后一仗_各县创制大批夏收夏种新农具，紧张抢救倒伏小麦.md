    This newspaper Zhengzhou, 11th dispatch: The people of Henan Province, who are on the eve of the important battle of summer harvesting and planting, have begun to urgently mobilize to carry out comprehensive preparatory work. The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) requires all localities to take summer harvesting and planting as the central task of the current countryside, and calls for "a month of great battles to complete the task of summer harvesting and planting in a faster, better, and more economical way." On May 9, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee jointly issued instructions, making comprehensive and detailed arrangements for the summer harvesting and planting work in the province, striving to turn the promising wheat harvest into reality, and at the same time sowing the seeds for a greater autumn harvest.
    As a result of the hard work of millions of people for a winter and a spring, the summer crops on more than 80 million mu of land in Henan Province are growing unprecedentedly well. The scene of a sea of ​​wheat in the countryside is heartening. However, this year's summer harvest and planting tasks in Henan Province are heavy, time is tight, and labor is costly. Within a month, it is necessary to complete the harvesting and threshing tasks of more than 80 million mu of summer crops, as well as the summer planting tasks of more than 80 million mu, and to do a good job in the autumn management of 50 million mu of farmland. Especially in summer planting, the task of transplanting rice stubble on more than 10 million mu and planting sweet potato stubble on more than 18 million mu must be completed at the same time. Therefore, farm work such as harvesting wheat, threshing, land preparation, transplanting rice, sowing seeds, and autumn management are concentrated together, and the tasks are more arduous than in any other year.
    In order to mobilize the people of the whole province to fight this battle of summer harvest and planting, and to lay a beneficial foundation for a bumper agricultural harvest in the province this year, the Henan Provincial Party Committee convened a special meeting on May 9 to deploy the summer harvest and planting work. The meeting decided that the entire Party and all the people should immediately mobilize to greet the summer harvest and planting, and demanded that all preparations be completed before May 25. The meeting emphasized that we must first do a good job in ideological preparation for the summer harvest and planting, and carry out large-scale debates. Then, on the basis of ideological unity, formulate an advanced and reliable comprehensive plan for summer harvest, planting, and distribution. In order to solve the contradiction of insufficient labor in summer harvesting and planting, the meeting required the mass production and promotion of new-style agricultural tools and the organization of large-scale socialist cooperation. The meeting particularly believed that the late-stage management of wheat fields cannot be relaxed, and required that "from green to yellow, from yellow to the field, from the field to the barn," we must ensure that the harvested wheat returns home.
    The meeting also required all departments to immediately mobilize and fully support the summer harvest and planting. All organs, troops, groups, and schools in the province must make plans for support before May 20 and promptly invest in this movement.
    The joint instructions of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee put forward ten important measures for summer harvesting and planting:
    1. Immediately launch a mass summer harvest and planting debate throughout the province. Through debate, cadres and the masses will realize the great significance of doing a good job in summer harvest and planting for the whole year's harvest, as well as how to tap potential, organize cooperation and support, and complete the task of summer harvest and planting in a faster, better, and more economical way. Then formulate a plan and specific arrangements for summer harvesting and planting.
    2. Seize the opportunity and do a good job in all aspects of preparation for summer harvesting and planting, requiring that all preparations be completed by May 25. We must continue to grasp the late-stage management of wheat, completely eliminate pests, prevent lodging, and prepare to overcome possible natural disasters such as water, drought, wind, and hail.
    3. Conduct a large-scale inventory of farm work, labor, and animal power, make arrangements for labor and livestock, and do everything possible to improve labor efficiency. Organize various professional teams and shock brigades, assign work and contract tasks, carry out socialist labor competitions, and organize large-scale socialist cooperation between townships and townships, cooperatives and cooperatives, teams and teams, mountains and plains, cities and villages. Cities should organize a large number of laborers to participate in summer harvesting and planting.
    4. Do a good job in preparing agricultural tools for summer harvesting and planting. At present, we must first strive to produce and promote harvesting, transportation, threshing, cultivation, and other agricultural tools related to summer harvesting and planting in large quantities. Before the end of May, we must complete and overfulfill the original task of promoting 7 million improved agricultural tools. At the same time, we must vigorously manufacture and repair various small agricultural tools.
    5. Before the wheat harvest, launch a mass wheat appraisal and seed selection campaign throughout the province. Provinces, special districts, counties, townships, and cooperatives should quickly select key areas for high yield and organize on-site visits and appraisals. Use comparison methods to find out the reasons for wheat yield increase and decrease, educate the masses, and learn from experience. And conscientiously do a good job in wheat seed selection, and formulate a preliminary plan for the 1959 wheat leap forward.
    6. We must strengthen flood and drought prevention work. We must ensure that wheat is not damaged in the event of strong winds, heavy rains, and continuous rain, and complete summer sowing in the event of drought and no moisture.
    7. Summer harvesting should be fast and meticulous. The order of harvesting should be arranged reasonably, harvesting one piece when it is ripe, and promoting on-site treading and large-scale treading to achieve three fasts (fast harvesting, fast threshing, and fast warehousing), three cleans (clean cutting, clean threshing, and clean winnowing), three preventions (fire prevention, wind and rain prevention, and theft prevention), and one guarantee (guarantee that every grain returns home). We must always be vigilant and resolutely crack down on sabotage activities.
    8. Summer planting should be early and good. We should try to deeply plow the land, apply sufficient base fertilizer, select fine seeds, and plant reasonably densely. Cotton and oil crops on wheat stubble must complete the sowing area stipulated in the national plan.
    9. All agricultural cooperatives should quickly make arrangements for the lives of members in May and June.
    10. Leading comrades at all levels of the Party and government should take the lead and strengthen leadership. Each special district, county, and township should establish a summer harvest and planting command to unify forces and unify actions.
    This newspaper Zhengzhou, 11th dispatch: The agricultural tool reform movement in Henan Province has entered a new stage. The vast number of peasants and handicraft workers in the province are using their brains and offering suggestions to create and rush to produce various new-style agricultural tools for summer harvesting and planting.
    After the summer harvest and planting debate in Hengcun Township, Huaxian County, all agricultural cooperatives in the township launched a "four comparisons and one look" competition of "comparing inventions, comparing creations, comparing reforms, comparing speed, economy, and good results, and seeing which cooperative is prepared properly." In just three days, 470 new tools for summer harvesting and planting, such as harvesters, have been manufactured. Li Qingshan, a member of the Xinguang Agricultural Cooperative in Yangzhai Township, Changge County, after painstaking research, successfully created a hand-cranked wheat threshing machine, which can thresh 70 mu of wheat a day, saving 60 manpower and 60 animal power. The swallow-style harvester created by Gao Qingshan, a young member of the Guanghui Tenth Cooperative in Nanxi Township, and the hand-pushed harvester created by Jia Mulin, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Fifth Cooperative in Chengguan Township, can each harvest 30 mu of wheat a day by one person. These advanced tools will be widely promoted in Changge County. The Tieye Cooperative in Dancheng County has successfully created a hand-cranked harvester with eight sickles on two iron wheels, which can cut six ridges of wheat at a time, and the efficiency is six times higher than manual wheat harvesting. Many places have also created automatic windmills for winnowing instead of manpower, reducing labor intensity and improving efficiency.
    While creating and rushing to produce new-style tools in large quantities, all localities have also paid great attention to appropriately improving small agricultural tools. For example, some places have transformed sickles and shovels into double-headed sickles and double-headed shovels, which can double the efficiency of harvesting with the same labor intensity. Li Guoren, a carpenter from Bukou Township, Shangshui County, has transformed the three-toothed or two-toothed forks used to raise the field in the past into six-toothed forks, which can lift 300 jin of wheat straw at a time, which is fast and labor-saving, and the cost is only three yuan. The Xin Xin Agricultural Cooperative in Huaimiao Township, Yanshi County, installed steel balls on the stone roller to reduce the pulling force, which can reduce the animal power for threshing by 2,755. In terms of summer planting agricultural tools, there are also many tools created and improved in various places. In order to adapt to the new situation of a large number of rice replanting after the wheat harvest this year, various new-style rice agricultural tools have been created in various places. Among them are harrows for leveling paddy fields, weeding hoes for weeding and fertilizing, and rice transplanters.
    Xinhua News Agency Zhengzhou, 11th dispatch: The vast number of peasants in Henan Province fought against wind and rain with incomparable heroic spirit, seized grain from disasters, and rescued lodged wheat in the rain.
    Hou Shutang, secretary of the Meng County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible persons immediately led more than 700 people from the county's directly affiliated organs to the 561st, Liming, and Mingxing Agricultural Cooperatives to cooperate with the masses in tying up wheat after the wind forecast. The number of people involved in this movement in Anyang County was 155,000, and in just half a day, the county pulled ropes in 18,600 mu of wheat fields, tied sticks in 43,400 mu, and drained 20,000 mu of accumulated water in wheat fields. Yanshi, Changyuan, and other counties have launched an intense struggle to rescue lodged wheat. The Henan Provincial People's Committee issued an emergency notice on the 11th on overcoming wind and rain disasters in some areas, requiring all localities to take measures to actively rescue the wheat according to the lodging situation.

　　河南党政领导机关动员全党全民作好全面准备
　　打好小麦大丰收最后一仗
　　各县创制大批夏收夏种新农具，紧张抢救倒伏小麦
    本报郑州11日电　处在夏收夏种重要战斗前夕的河南全省人民，开始紧急动员进行全面的准备工作。中共河南省委要求各地把夏收夏种作为当前农村的中心任务，并且号召“大战一个月，多快好省地完成夏收夏种任务”。河南省委和省人民委员会5月9日联合发出指示，对全省夏收夏种工作进行了全面细致的部署，力争把大有希望的小麦丰收变成事实，同时为秋季播下更大丰收的种子。
    经过千百万群众苦干一冬、大战一春的结果，河南全省八千多万亩夏收作物生长空前良好。农村中一片丰收的麦海，令人心花怒放。但是，今年河南省夏收夏种的任务大、时间紧、费工多。在一个月的时间内，既要完成八千多万亩夏收作物的收打任务，又要完成八千多万亩的夏种任务，还要做好五千万亩田地的大秋管理。特别是在夏种中，一千多万亩麦茬稻的插秧任务和一千八百多万亩麦茬红薯的栽种任务，要同时完成。因此收麦、打场、整地、插秧、播种和大秋管理等项农活集中在一起，任务比任何一年都繁重。
    为了动员全省人民打好夏收夏种这一仗，为全省今年农业大丰收打下利胜的基础，河南省委5月9日召开了专门会议，部署了夏收夏种工作。会议决定全党全民立即总动员迎接夏收夏种，要求在5月25日以前把准备工作全部做好。会议强调要首先做好夏收夏种的思想准备工作，开展大辩论。然后在思想一致的基础上，订出先进可靠的夏收夏种和分配的全面规划。为了解决夏收夏种中的劳力不足的矛盾，会议要求大量赶制、推广新式农具和组织社会主义大协作。会议特别认为麦田后期管理不能放松，要求“由青护到黄，由黄护到场，由场护到仓”，一定要使丰收的小麦颗粒还家。
    会议还要求各部门立即动员，全力支援夏收夏种。全省所有机关、部队、团体、学校，都要在5月20日以前作出支援的规划，及时投入这一运动。
    河南省委和省人民委员会的联合指示中提出了夏收夏种的十项重要措施：
    一、立即在全省范围内开展一次群众性的夏收夏种大辩论。通过辩论，使干部和群众认识到作好夏收夏种工作对全年丰收的重大意义，以及如何发挥潜力、组织协作支援、多快好省地完成夏收夏种任务。然后制订出夏收夏种的规划和具体安排。
    二、抓紧时机，从各方面作好夏收夏种的准备工作，要求在5月25日前一切准备就绪。要继续抓好小麦后期管理，彻底消灭虫害、防止倒伏，准备战胜可能遇到的水、旱、风、雹等自然灾害。
    三、进行农活、劳力、畜力大站队，作好劳畜力安排，千方百计提高劳动效率。组织各种专业队和突击队，分工包干，开展社会主义劳动竞赛，组织乡和乡、社和社、队和队、山地和平地、城市和农村的社会主义大协作。城市要组织大批劳动力参加夏收夏种。
    四、做好夏收夏种农具的准备工作。当前首先努力赶制和大量推广收割、运输、打场、耕种等与夏收夏种有关的农具，在5月底以前要完成和超额完成原定推广七百万件改良农具的任务，同时，必须大力制造、修补各种小件农具。
    五、麦收前在全省范围内开展一次群众性的小麦评比、选种运动。省、专、县、乡、社都应迅速选定丰产重点，组织现场参观评比。用对比的办法，找出小麦增产和减产的原因，教育群众，吸取经验。并认真作好小麦选种工作，制订出1959年小麦跃进初步规划。
    六、必须加强防汛、防旱工作。要保证在狂风暴雨和阴雨连绵的情况下麦子不受损失；在干旱无墒的情况下，完成夏播。
    七、夏收要快要细，要合理安排收割次序，熟一片收一片，推广就地踩场，踩大场，做到三快（快收、快打、快入仓）三净（割净、打净、扬净）、三防（防火、防风雨、防偷盗）、一保证（保证颗粒还家）。要随时警惕并坚决打击破坏活动。
    八、夏种要早要好，要尽量深翻土地，施足底肥，选用良种，合理密植。麦茬棉花和油料作物，必须完成国家计划规定的播种面积。
    九、所有农业合作社都要迅速作好5、6两月份社员的生活安排。
    十、各级党政负责同志亲自动手，加强领导。各专、县、乡成立夏收夏种指挥部，统一力量，统一行动。
    本报郑州11日电　河南省农具改革运动已经进入新的阶段，全省广大农民和手工业工人，正围绕着夏收夏种，人人动脑筋，个个献计策，大量创造与赶制各种夏收夏种的新式农具。
    滑县横村乡经过夏收夏种大辩论，全乡各农业社掀起了“比发明、比创造、比改革、比多快好省，看哪个社准备得妥当”的“四比一看”竞赛，仅在三天内，已制造各种收割机等夏收夏种新工具四百七十件。长葛县杨寨乡新光农业社社员李青山，经过苦心钻研，创制成功一部手摇小麦脱粒机，一天能打麦七十亩，可节省人力六十个，畜力六十个。该县南席乡光辉十社青年社员高青山创造的燕子式收割机，和城关乡第五社中共支部副书记贾木林创造的手推收割机，一个人操作，一天都能割麦三十亩。这些先进工具都将在长葛县普遍推广。郸城县铁业社创造成功一种手摇收割机在两个铁轮上带上八把镰刀，一次可以割麦七垅，效率比人工割麦要提高六倍。不少地方还创造了用来代替人力扬场的自动风车，减轻了劳动强度，提高了效率。
    各地在大量创造和赶制新式工具的同时，还十分注意对于小件农具进行适当改良。例如有的地方把镰刀和铲子，改制成了双头镰，双头铲，同样的劳动强度，便可使收割的效率提高一倍。商水县埠口乡木工李国恩把过去起场的三鼾齿或二齿的忙杈，改制成六齿忙杈，一次能起三百斤麦秸，又快又省劲，成本只要三元。偃师县槐庙乡的新新农业社在石磙上安装钢珠，减轻拉力，就可减少打场畜力二千七百五十五个。在夏种农具方面，各地创造和改良的工具也非常多。为适应今年麦收后大量改种水稻的新情况，各地创制了各种水稻新式农具。其中有平整水田的耙、锄草施肥两用耘锄和插秧机等。
    据新华社郑州11日电　河南省广大农民以无比的英雄气概同风雨搏斗，向灾害夺粮，冒雨抢救倒伏的小麦。
    中共孟县县委书记侯书堂等负责人，在大风预报以后，马上率领县直属机关七百多人到五六一、黎明、明星等农业社配合群众进行拦捆小麦的工作。安阳全县投入这一运动的人数就有十五万五千多人，仅半天时间全县共往麦地扯绳一万八千六百亩，扎棍四万三千四百亩，并且排出麦地积水两万亩。偃师、长垣等县都展开了抢救倒伏的紧张斗争。河南省人民委员会在11日发出战胜部分地区风雨灾害的紧急通知，要求各地要迅速根据麦子倒伏情况，分别采取措施积极抢救。
