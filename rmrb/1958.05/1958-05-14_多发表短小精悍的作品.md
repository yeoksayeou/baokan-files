    Publish More Short and Incisive Works
    Mr. Lao She's "Visiting Dulles" (published on page 8, April 11th) is an excellent xiangsheng (comedic dialogue), less than six hundred words in length. It vividly and graphically exposes Dulles's reactionary nature: his unreasonable arrogance, his twisting of black and white, his reactionary behavior, and his resolute opposition to the people.
    The ending of the xiangsheng is especially brilliant: "The more you (referring to Dulles) say goodbye, the sooner you will disappear!" "How will I disappear?" "The more you ask, the less I'll tell you!" The satire is profound and the meaning is deep.
    We very much like this short xiangsheng. Of course, we also welcome other forms of short, incisive, and richly varied works.

    多发表短小精悍的作品
    老舍先生写的“访问杜勒斯”（载4月11日第八版）是一篇很好的相声，全文不到六百字，却生动、形象地揭穿了杜勒斯的蛮横无理、颠倒黑白、倒行逆施、坚决与人民为敌的反动本质。
    相声的结尾特别妙：“你（指杜勒斯）越说再见就越快见不着你了！”“怎么见不着我了呢？”“你越问，我越不说！”讽刺深刻，语意深长。
    我们非常喜欢这篇小相声。当然我们也同样欢迎其他形式的短小精悍、丰富多采的作品。
