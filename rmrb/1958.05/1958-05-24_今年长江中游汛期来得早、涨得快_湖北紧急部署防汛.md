Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 23rd: The Hubei Province held an emergency flood prevention meeting on the 22nd, requiring all localities to exert their utmost efforts, make early preparations for flood prevention, overcome waterlogging and drought disasters, and ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production.

This year, the flood season in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River came earlier and rose faster than in previous years. The current water level at Wuhan Pass is more than one meter higher than the water level during the same period in 1954. At the same time, according to weather forecasts, there will still be more rain in the Jiangnan area in June. Therefore, the meeting required all localities to be highly vigilant and make early preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and the reserve of flood prevention materials.

The meeting pointed out that in the past, flood prevention was only carried out on the embankment lines along the rivers and lakes. Now, because a large number of reservoirs, sluice gates, and other water conservancy hub projects have been built in mountainous areas, hilly areas, and plain lake areas, their role in storing floodwater, irrigating, and draining water should be fully utilized during this year's flood prevention. In order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, the meeting required all localities to do a good job in preventing windstorms, mountain floods, and drought while doing a good job in flood prevention. The flood prevention work in various localities should implement the principle of "overall defense, strengthening key points," and resolutely achieve that as the water rises, the embankments must be raised, people must be on the embankments, and the safety of the Jianghan embankments, large reservoirs, and water conservancy hub projects must be ensured under the water level conditions of 1954. After analyzing the various favorable factors for flood prevention this year, the meeting unanimously believed that as long as everyone raises their vigilance and makes early preparations, it is entirely possible to overcome this year's waterlogging and drought disasters.

    今年长江中游汛期来得早、涨得快
    湖北紧急部署防汛
    据新华社武汉23日电　湖北省22日召开防汛紧急会议，要求各地鼓足干劲，提早作好防汛准备，战胜水旱灾害，确保农业生产大丰收。
    今年长江中游的汛期比往年来得早，涨得快，武汉关目前水位比1954年同期水位高一公尺多，同时，根据气象预报，江南一带6月份还是多雨，因此，会议要求各地高度警惕起来，从思想上，组织上和防汛器材储备上提早作好准备。
    会议指出，过去防汛只在沿江滨湖的堤线上进行，现在由于山区、丘陵区和平原湖区都修了大批水库、水闸等水利枢纽工程，因此今年防汛时应该充分发挥它们蓄洪、灌溉和排水的作用。为了确保农业丰收，会议要求各地在做好防汛工作的同时，还必须防浪、防山洪和防旱工作。各地防汛工作，应贯彻“全面防守，重点加强”的方针，坚决做到水涨堤高，人在堤在，在1954年水位情况下确保江汉堤防、大型水库和水利枢纽工程的安全。会议分析了今年防汛的各种有利因素后，一致认为，只要大家提高警惕，提早作好准备，战胜今年的水旱灾害是完全有把握的。
