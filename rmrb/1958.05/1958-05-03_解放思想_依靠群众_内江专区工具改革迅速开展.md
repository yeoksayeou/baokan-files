    Emancipate the Mind, Rely on the Masses
    Tool Reform Develops Rapidly in Neijiang Prefecture

    (Our newspaper's Chengdu dispatch, 30th) Reporter Wang Huandou reports: Neijiang Prefecture, Sichuan Province, has adopted the method of "borrowing a ladder to climb upstairs and embroidering on the upper floor" in rural areas, changing the slow progress of tool reform. Currently, more than 300 types of new tools have been promoted throughout the prefecture.

    Neijiang Prefecture is an economic crop area, which has always required a lot of labor. This year, due to the expanded scale of agricultural technology reform, the amount of labor required has increased by half compared to last year. It has become very necessary to accelerate tool reform and improve labor efficiency. However, many farmers felt that their cultural level was too low and were afraid to get involved; local handicraft cooperatives and factories also felt they lacked experience, and progress was slow. Therefore, the relevant leading departments vigorously collected new tools that had been created nationwide, organized the masses to "borrow a ladder to climb upstairs and embroider on the upper floor," and imitated and improved them according to local conditions. As a result, the masses broadened their horizons, found the way, and emancipated their minds from the fear of getting involved in tool reform. Baitta District in Jianyang County improved the aerial cable car of Suining Prefecture, increasing work efficiency tenfold compared to carrying things manually. Last year, the prefecture's 423 iron, wood, and bamboo production cooperatives created only 14 types of tools, while in the past two months they have imitated and modified more than 50 types.

    The modified tools, because they incorporate many advantages, can be both good and economical. Taking the improved waterwheels in various places as an example, some have added a crankshaft, and some have added a stone roller. It only costs two yuan or so to save 50% of the labor, and the water output is comparable to a Liberation-style waterwheel.

    Many signs indicate that this movement of imitating and modifying tools is leading the masses onto the path of creation and invention.

    解放思想　依靠群众
    内江专区工具改革迅速开展
    本报成都30日电　记者王焕斗报道：四川省内江专区农村中采用“借梯上楼，楼上绣花”的办法，改变了工具改革进度迟缓的现象。现在全专区已推广三百多种新工具。
    内江专区是经济作物区，历来需工多。今年由于农业技术改革的规模扩大，需工量比去年增加一半，加紧改革工具、提高劳动效率已显得十分必要。但是不少农民感到文化水平太低，不敢过问；当地手工业社和工厂也感到缺乏经验，工作进展不快。于是，有关领导部门便大力搜集全国范围内已创造出来的新工具，组织群众“借梯上楼，楼上绣花”，因地制宜地模仿和改良。这一来，群众眼界打开，摸到了门路，解放了不敢过问工具改革的思想。简阳县白塔区改进了遂宁专区的空中滑车，比人力担东西提高工效十倍。全区的四百二十三个铁、木、竹器生产合作社去年只创造出十四种工具，而近两个月就仿造和改制出五十多种。
    改制的工具因为综合了很多优点，能做到又好又省。以各地改良的水车为例，有的加个曲轴，有的加个石辊，只需花两元多钱，就能节省50％的人工，出水量抵得上解放式水车。
    许多迹象表明，这一仿造、改制工具的运动正在把群众引上创造发明的道路。
