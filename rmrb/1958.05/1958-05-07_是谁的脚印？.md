Whose Footprints?
Zhang Zhengmo

Snowflakes fluttered, enveloping heaven and earth. On this path connecting the companies, the snow had piled up thickly. A footstep would sink into a hole half a foot deep; but in an instant, it would be smooth again, with no trace left.

The second squad leader, stepping in my footprints, said from behind: "Does your squad's stove burn an entire lump of coal all night?"

"It does!" I said. I remembered that these past few days, I had added a lump of coal before going to bed, and the fire was still strong when I got up the next morning.

He asked again: "Why did the instructor tell us to add coal in the middle of the night?"

I guessed that perhaps the instructor didn't quite understand the situation. I said: "He also said that the two new comrades who just arrived in our squad kick off their blankets when they sleep. Actually, I was on duty last night and saw that the new comrades were covered up properly."

The second squad leader didn't hear me clearly and cocked his head to ask me loudly. For some reason, he suddenly went "噗" and plunged half his leg into a snowdrift beside the road. I held back my laughter and pulled him up. He spat and said: "That was close! If you walk this road at night, you might slip into the ditch."

In the evening, the room was warm, and I quickly fell asleep. Suddenly, the person coming on duty woke me up. "It's my turn to take over!"

At this time, the wind and snow were getting heavier. As soon as I opened the door, the wind lifted my coat high in the air. But I still bent over and braced myself against the wind as I walked towards the sentry box.

After checking the post once, I thought of going to the nearby company headquarters for a drink of hot water. As I approached the company headquarters, I noticed a shallow line of footprints in the snow. "Someone must have just walked by!" I couldn't help but quicken my pace and follow the footprints. At the end, it was precisely the instructor's dormitory and company headquarters office.

The door was ajar, and snowflakes swirled into the doorway. I gently walked in. There was no sound inside, and the instructor's bed was also empty. I felt the bedding, and it was still a little warm, indicating that he had only left recently.

Lifting the stove lid, the coal fire had long been extinguished, leaving only half a stove of ash. A chill suddenly filled the room. I thought: "No wonder the instructor told us to add coal in the middle of the night. He was referring to this stove."

When it was time to hand over the shift, I clearly explained the task to the next shift, and then put on my cloak and walked back. As soon as I entered the door, the stove was glowing with a leaping red light, and a wave of heat immediately rushed towards me. I lifted the stove lid, and the coal was burning fiercely, emitting "必必" sparks – it was obvious that coal had just been added! "Then, who was it?" I coughed softly, but there was no sound in the room, only the even snores of everyone.

Looking around in the light of the stove fire, strange! The cotton coats and pants covering them were all neatly pressed. But when I touched the new comrades' blankets, a chill soaked my palm. I switched on the flashlight, and it turned out that they were covered with a coat, and the coat had fine snowflakes on it, melted into sparkling water droplets. Wasn't this the instructor's coat!

I squatted beside the hot stove, watching the blood-red leaping flames, listening to the "必必" bursting sounds in the stove, and it seemed that my face was redder than the stove fire! My heart was beating faster than the bursting of the coal! I immediately took off my own coat, gently covered the new comrades, took off that coat, and ran out like a shot.

Out the door, I found a shallow line of footprints still under the eaves. Looking at the footprints, my eyes suddenly blurred, but I could still clearly see: the shallow footprints, regularly followed the western mountain slope, winding and disappearing at the end of the company headquarters; however, they were deeply imprinted in my heart.

    是谁的脚印？
    张政模
    雪花纷纷扬扬地把天地都裹在一起了。在通连部的这条小路上，雪花堆得厚厚的，一脚下去，就露出半尺来深的窟窿；可一霎时，又是平平整整的，什么痕迹也没有了。
    二班长踩着我的脚印，跟在后面说：“你们班的炉子，是不是一炉炭就着一宿？”
    “能！”我说。我记得这些天来，临睡前加一炉煤，第二天起床时火还是旺的。
    他又问：“刚才指导员怎么叫我们半夜加炭呢？”
    我猜想，也许是指导员不大了解情况。我说：“他还说我们班里才来的那两个新同志睡觉爱蹬被子。其实，昨晚上我代班时就看过，新同志的被子盖得好好的。”
    二班长没听清我的话，侧着头大声反问我。不知怎的，只听他“噗”的一声，大半条腿插进路旁的雪窝里，我忍住笑把他拉起来，他呸了一声：“够呛！这条道要是晚上走呀，说不定就得滑下沟去。”
    晚上，房子暖烘烘的，我很快就入了梦境。忽然交班的摇醒了我。“该我接班了！”
    这时，风雪越来越大了。刚拉开门，大衣被迎面的风挑起老高。但我仍然弯着腰顶着风往岗篷走去。
    查完一遍岗，想到就近的连部去喝口热水。当我快走到连部时，发觉雪地上印下浅浅的一行脚印，“一定有人才走过！”我不由得加快步子，顺着脚印走去。走到尽头，正是指导员的宿舍兼连部办公室。
    门虚掩着，雪片??的往门里钻，我轻轻走进去，里面没有一点动静，指导员的铺也是空的。摸摸被窝，还有点暖气，说明他才出去不久。
    掀开炉盖，煤火早已熄灭，只剩下半炉煤灰，房里骤然添了一股寒意。我想：“难怪指导员叫我们要半夜添煤，他是根据这个炉子说的。”
    到了交班时间，我向下一班交代清了任务，就披着斗篷往回走。进了门，炉膛泛着跃动的红光，一团热气立即向我袭来。我揭开了炉盖，煤块正熊熊地燃烧着，迸出“必必”的火星——这分明是才添了煤啊！“那么，这是谁呢？”我轻轻咳嗽一声，屋里没有动静，听到的是大家均匀的鼾声。
    借着炉火光一看，奇怪！他们盖在被上的棉袄棉裤，都是周正熨贴的。但当我摸着新同志的被子时，一股凉意浸着我的手心。我捏亮了电筒，原来他们身上盖了一件大衣，大衣上有细碎的雪粉，融成了晶亮的水珠子。这不就是指导员的大衣吗！
    我蹲在火热的炉旁，望着血红跳跃的火舌，听着炉里“必必”迸炸的声音，似乎觉得：我的脸比炉火还红！我的心跳动得比煤块迸炸还急速！我立即脱下自己的大衣，轻轻给新同志盖上，揭下那件大衣，飞也似的往外跑。
    出了门，我发现檐下还留着一行浅浅的脚印。看着脚印，我的眼前突然模糊了，但我仍清楚地看到：那浅浅的脚印，有规则地顺着西沟山坡，蜿蜒消失在连部的尽头；然而，它却是深深地印在我的心头。
