Xinhua News Agency, 4th dispatch from Paris: After carrying out cabinet formation activities for ten days, Pflimlin said on the evening of the 3rd that he had definitively given up hope of organizing France's twenty-fifth post-war government. The French government crisis has now lasted nineteen days. Before Pflimlin, Pierre Pflimlin, the right-wing leader of the Popular Republican Movement, had already failed.

Pflimlin, the right-wing leader of the Social Democratic Resistance Union, had to abandon the idea of becoming the new Prime Minister after the Socialist Party refused to participate in the government. It is revealed that the reason why the Socialist Party refused to participate in the government was that the left-wing forces within the party had become increasingly critical of the current Algerian policy; at the same time, the sentiment of the working masses participating in and supporting the Socialist Party demanding struggle for wages is rising.

    法政府危机深重
    普利文组阁失败
    据新华社4日讯  巴黎消息：在进行了十天的组阁活动后普利文在3日晚上说，他已经最后地放弃了组织法国战后第二十五个政府的希望。法国政府危机到今天已经延续了十九天，在普利文之前，人民共和党右翼领袖皮杜尔已经失败。
    社会民主抵抗联盟右翼领袖普利文是在社会党拒绝参加政府之后，不得不打消当新总理的念头的。据透露，社会党之所以拒绝参加政府，是由于这个党内的左翼力量已经越来越尖锐地批评现行的阿尔及利亚政策；同时，参加和支持社会党的工人群众要求为工资而斗争的情绪越来越高涨。
