Leaving Beijing, Promoting Everywhere
Significant Changes in the Work Style of Leaders in Central State Organs

　　This newspaper reports that after a year of rectification movement, the work style of leaders in central state organs has undergone significant changes. Leading cadres are going deep into grassroots levels to "seek wisdom" from the masses, which has become a trend in many organs, greatly correcting bureaucratic practices.

　　"Central Ministers are Easier to See Now"

　　According to statistics from thirty-one ministry-level units of central state organs, since January of this year, more than 680 director-general and bureau-level cadres have left their offices to conduct investigations and research and promote advanced experiences in various regions; among them are more than 170 ministers, vice ministers, and ministerial assistants. These organs' leading cadres have participated in over 1,000 on-site experience exchange meetings, investigation and research meetings, and various professional conferences across the country. Many of these meetings were convened by ministers in factories or agricultural production cooperatives. Because leading cadres frequently go deep into grassroots levels, personally intervening and promptly helping to solve problems, communication between upper and lower levels has improved, and relationships have been strengthened. Many grassroots cadres say, "Now central ministers are easier to see," and "Problems are resolved promptly, without the need to frequently go to Beijing like in the past."

　　Greatly Promoting Practical Work

　　Leading cadres of various organs have been going deep into grassroots levels, promptly identifying problems, summarizing experiences, and promoting them locally. This lively and vigorous leadership method, following the mass line, has played a significant role in promoting practical work. In the past, the Ministry of Agriculture did not do enough in promptly discovering, summarizing, and promoting advanced experiences. Some work was often a case of "this year's experience, promoted next year." This year, this situation has changed. Many leading cadres of the ministry have promptly gone deep into various regions, working with local leading organs to inspect work, and have successively convened more than ten on-site promotion meetings to exchange experiences in advanced areas. This has greatly promoted timely strengthening of rapeseed and wheat field management, completing the expansion of rice planting, improving low-yielding fields in the south, promoting the double-wheel double-share plow, rapidly breeding draught animals, and launching large-scale pest and disease prevention. Some leading cadres, during inspections, discovered problems and also helped local areas organize mutual observation visits between regions. Gu Da-chuan, Vice Minister of this ministry, during an inspection in the Yanbei and Xinxian special districts of Shanxi Province, consulted with local leading cadres and visited Xushui County in Hebei Province. As a result, the experiences of Xushui County quickly spread to the Yanbei and Xinxian areas.

　　Liberating and Enriching Leadership Thinking

　　The combination of leaders and the masses, with politics taking command, has greatly enriched and liberated leadership thinking. The Party Group of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry required that leading cadres, when going deep into grassroots levels, must personally take action, summarize typical experiences, and simultaneously implement the principle of combining leading cadres with grassroots cadres, combining technicians with workers, and jointly "conducting on-site visits and comparisons, on-site airing of views, and on-site liberation of thought." This not only solved problems in practical work but also enriched leadership thinking. Previously, in the metallurgical industry, some people believed that if the iron content of iron ore concentrate reached 61% and the metal recovery rate in the ore dressing process reached 80% to 81%, it was "good enough" and could not be improved further because the contradiction of technically improving the iron content of concentrate and improving the metal recovery rate could not be resolved. However, at the on-site meeting held in Benxi, the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant resolved this contradiction, providing the experience of achieving an iron content of concentrate of 65% and a metal recovery rate of 90%. If Anshan and Benxi could both reach this level, they could increase production of iron concentrate by more than two million tons per year.

　　The slogan put forward by the Ministry of Chemical Industry is "Take the field and grasp politics." Now, when the leading cadres of this ministry go to various places to inspect work, many first explain the situation and elaborate on policies to the masses through report meetings, symposiums, and other forms, so that the masses connect the overall situation of socialist construction with their specific production activities. Then, they work with the masses to study and solve problems in production. This approach has been very effective. Li Chao-bai, Assistant Minister of this ministry, after going deep into the Yongli and Jiuda Dag沽 plants in Tianjin, explained to the workers the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture across the country and explained the urgent need for chemical products among the people of the country, greatly arousing the enthusiasm of the workers. They immediately tapped into the potential for increasing production in all aspects, proposing leap forward targets for soda ash production that some had previously considered difficult to achieve.

　　Promoting Rectification within the Organs

　　Many organs go deep into grassroots levels to summarize the experiences of the masses, collect the opinions of the masses, and simultaneously combine this with the rectification movement within the organs. Units that do this can not only promptly guide professional work but also promote the rectification within the organs. The Second Ministry of Commerce recently convened on-site meetings on the utilization of wild fibers and waste products in Santai County, Sichuan Province, and Wuji County, Hebei Province, respectively. These two professional meetings established banners for their native products and waste products procurement businesses. The Party Group of the Second Ministry of Commerce summarized these experiences of the masses, believing that the experiences created by the masses in Santai County and Wuji County are actually the direction of the work of the Second Ministry of Commerce. Now, based on these experiences, this ministry is launching a wave of "discussing what is unreal," believing that if commercial work establishes a production perspective, a mass perspective, and a political perspective, it can directly expand resource utilization and tap into wealth through commercial work, accumulating funds for local industries.

　　Ministers Personally Summarize and Write Reports

　　After leading cadres go deep into grassroots levels, they improve their leadership level. Many ministers personally summarized the experiences of the masses and wrote many articles and reports. According to statistics from twenty-three ministries, ministers and vice ministers personally wrote more than seventy important reports; the practice of not doing anything themselves and completely relying on secretaries has been greatly reduced. Since the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has had eighteen director-general and bureau-level cadres write more than forty reports and articles, including nine Party group members who wrote eighteen editorials for the ministry's "Metallurgical News." These reports and articles mostly summarized the important experiences and insights they gained after going deep into grassroots levels. After the Director of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry comprehensively inspected the iron ore exploration situation in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, he discovered that there were serious conservative tendencies in the geological exploration work. This director not only helped correct the mistaken view of the Wu'an Geological Exploration Team that there were only a few million tons of iron ore reserves there, affirmed that Wu'an still had several hundred million tons of iron ore reserves, and wrote a well-founded commentary criticizing the tendency of technical conservatism in geological exploration work, which had a great impact on engineers, technicians, and management cadres.

### 走出北京　到处促进  中央国家机关领导作风大有转变

　　走出北京　到处促进
    中央国家机关领导作风大有转变
    本报讯　经过一年的整风运动，中央国家机关的领导作风有了很大转变，领导干部深入下层到群众中去“取经”，在许多机关形成风气，使官僚主义的作风得到很大纠正。
    “中央的部长好见了”
    根据中央国家机关三十一个部一级单位的统计，从今年1月份以来，有六百八十多位司局长以上干部走出了办公室，到各地去进行了调查研究和推广先进经验；其中部长、副部长和部长助理有一百七十多人；这些机关的领导干部在各地召开的现场经验交流会、调查研究会和各种专业会议等共有一千多个，有很多会议是部长们在工厂或农业生产合作社里召开的。由于领导干部经常深入下层亲自动手及时帮助解决问题，上下通了气，关系改进了，许多基层单位的干部说，“现在中央的部长好见了”，“有问题随时得到解决，不需要像过去那样经常进京了。”
    大大推动了实际工作
    各机关的领导干部深入下层，及时发现问题，及时总结经验，并且就地推广。这种生动活泼的群众路线的领导方法，对推动实际工作起了很大作用。农业部过去在领导工作中及时发现、总结和推广先进经验作得不够，有些工作常常是“今年的经验，明年推广”。今年这种情况改变了，这个部的许多领导干部及时深入各地，同当地的领导机关一道检查工作，并在许多先进地区先后召开了十多次交流经验的现场促进会，对及时加强油菜、麦田管理，完成扩种水稻，改进南方低产田，推广双轮双铧犁，迅速繁殖耕畜，展开大面积病虫害防治等，起了极大的促进作用。有的领导干部在视察中发现了问题，还随时帮助地方组织了地区之间的相互观摩。这个部的副部长顾大川在山西省雁北、忻县两个专区视察时，就曾经会同当地的领导干部到河北省徐水县进行了参观。于是徐水县的经验很快就传到了雁北、忻县一带。
    解放和丰富了领导思想
    领导和群众相结合，以政治挂帅，大大地丰富了领导思想，解放了领导思想。冶金部党组要求领导干部深入下层时，必须做到亲自动手，总结典型经验，同时贯彻领导干部同基层干部相结合、技术人员同工人相结合、一起“就地参观评比、就地鸣放、就地解放思想”的方针，这样就不但解决了实际工作中的问题，而且丰富了领导思想。以前，在冶金工业中，有人认为铁矿精选粉含铁量达到61％，选矿过程中金属回收率达到80％到81％，已经“差不多”，不能再提高了，因为在技术上提高精选粉含铁量和提高金属回收率的矛盾解决不了，可是在本溪召开的现场会议上，南芬选矿厂解决了这个矛盾，提供了精选粉含铁量达到65％和金属回收率90％的经验。如果鞍钢和本溪都能达到这个水平，一年就可以增产二百多万吨铁精粉。
    化工部提出的口号是“出马抓政治”。现在这个部的领导干部在深入到各地视察工作时，很多都通过报告会、座谈会等形式，首先向群众讲解形势，阐述政策，使群众把社会主义建设的全局同他们具体的生产活动联系起来，然后再和群众一起研究解决生产中的问题，这种作法效果很好。这个部的部长助理李超白，深入到天津永利、久大沽厂后，向工人群众讲解了全国工农业大跃进的形势，说明了全国人民对化工产品的迫切需要，大大激发了工人群众的积极性，他们立即从各方面挖掘增产的潜力，提出了有些人原来认为难于实现的纯碱生产的跃进指标。
    推动了机关内部的整风
    许多机关深入下层总结群众的经验，搜集群众的意见，同时和机关内部的整风运动结合起来。这样做的单位既能及时指导业务工作，又推动了机关内部的整风。第二商业部最近分别在四川省的三台县和河北省的无极县召开了野生纤维利用和废品利用的现场会议，这两个专业会议为他们的土产、废品收购业务树立了旗帜。第二商业部党组总结了群众的这些经验，认为三台县和无极县群众所创造的经验，实际上是第二商业部工作的方向。现在，这个部根据这些经验，正展开“论虚”的热潮，他们认为商业工作树立了生产观点、群众观点和政治观点，就可以通过商业工作来直接扩大资源利用，挖掘财富，为地方工业积累资金。
    部长亲自动手做总结写报告
    领导干部深入下层以后，提高了领导的水平，许多部长们都亲自动手总结了群众的经验，写了不少文章和报告。根据二十三个部的统计，部长和副部长们亲自写的重要报告有七十多件；像过去那种自己不动手、完全依赖秘书的作法已大大减少了。冶金部从今年以来，有十八位司局长以上干部写了四十多篇报告和文章，其中有九位党组成员为这个部的“冶金报”写了十八篇社论。这些报告和文章大都总结了他们深入下层以后所获得的重要经验和体会。冶金部的地质局局长到河北省武安县全面地检查了那里的铁矿勘探情况以后，发现地质勘探工作在技术上有严重的保守倾 向，这位局长不仅帮助纠正了武安地质勘探队认为那里只有几百万吨铁矿藏量的错误看法，肯定了武安还有几亿吨铁矿的储量，并且写了一篇有根有据地评述打破地质勘探工作中技术保守倾向的文章，在工程技术人员和管理干部中，发生了很大的影响。
