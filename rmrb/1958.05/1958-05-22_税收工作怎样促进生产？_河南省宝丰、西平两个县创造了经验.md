Xinhua News Agency, 21st: Baofeng and Xiping counties in Henan Province have created experiences in doing a good job in financial and tax work by starting with production.

The tax workers in these two counties, by going deep into production units and helping them overcome difficulties in production and operation, promoted the development of production, thereby fundamentally changing the relationship between the tax department and the production units. The masses presented them with banners, praising them as the people's "advisers" and "good cadres." On the basis of developing production, the tax revenue of the two counties in the first quarter increased by 23% compared with the same period last year, and achieved no tax evasion, no arrears, no errors, and no violations of policies.

Can tax work support and promote the development of production? Many financial and tax cadres in Henan Province have doubts about this issue. Some people believe that organizing production is the business of the production department, and the tax department is just about collecting taxes and supervising expenditures, and should not or cannot organize production; some people believe that only after a leap forward in industrial and agricultural production can financial and tax work leap forward; and some even believe that the leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has brought the difficulty of "spending first, then collecting" to financial and tax work. However, the tax cadres of Baofeng County and Xiping County educated those with these doubts with their own practical actions. They believe that as long as they clearly establish a political viewpoint, a production viewpoint, and a mass viewpoint in their thinking, tax work can do a lot to promote production, and there are many things that can be done. At the same time, financial and tax work can only be done well on the basis of developing production.

The tax cadres in these two counties generally promote production from the following aspects. First, tax cadres often go deep into agricultural cooperatives to investigate and study, help them formulate plans for developing diversified economies, and promote the development of rural sideline production. For example, in Hezhuang Village, Baofeng County, more than a dozen charcoal kilns had stopped production, and the agricultural cooperative cadres were unwilling to resume production. The tax cadres helped the agricultural cooperative calculate labor costs, capital accounts, and income accounts, and straightened out the thinking of the agricultural cooperative cadres, formulated a plan to restore and develop production, and decided to build twenty new charcoal kilns in addition to restoring all the old charcoal kilns to production. After all these charcoal kilns are put into production, they can produce 1,050 tons of charcoal annually, with an output value of 42,000 yuan. This will not only increase the income of the agricultural cooperative, but the tax bureau can also collect 2,940 yuan in taxes.

After formulating the plan, the tax cadres often go deep into the production units to help them solve difficulties in all aspects of production and operation such as funds, sales channels, raw material supply, and financial accounts. For these difficulties, the tax department actively helps to solve them if they can be solved; if they cannot be solved, they will travel back and forth on behalf of the units, contact relevant units, until they are solved. Since 1957, the Baofeng County Tax Bureau has helped production units solve difficulties more than 80 times. In order to better guide and organize mass production, tax personnel also painstakingly study technology to become experts in production. For example, the brick and tile kilns in Xiping County used to be operated manually, with high costs. It took 14 days to fire a kiln of bricks. Liu Yunhua, a cadre of the Heshui Tax Office, worked with the cooperative members to study and repeatedly trial-produced, and finally successfully created the "fast brick transportation out of the kiln method" using iron wire hanging trolleys, which increased the efficiency of transporting bricks out of the kiln by 16 times and saved a lot of manpower. Because the tax cadres helped the masses solve technical difficulties, the agricultural cooperatives regarded them as production technicians and consulted them on any problems.

The tax departments of Baofeng and Xiping counties have also reformed some rules and regulations and simplified tax payment procedures according to the needs of production. For example, for some factories, mines and workshops with little capital and production difficulties, the original method of reporting taxes as soon as the products left the factory was changed to reporting taxes after sales, so that the funds of small production units can be turned over more flexibly. In the past, factories, mines and workshops had to travel more than ten miles to the tax authorities to report taxes. Now, tax cadres go to each unit to handle tax collection procedures, which greatly facilitates production units.

    税收工作怎样促进生产？
    河南省宝丰、西平两个县创造了经验
    据新华社21日讯　河南省宝丰、西平两县创造了从生产入手做好财政税收工作的经验。
    这两县的税务工作人员由于深入生产单位，帮助克服生产经营中的困难，促进生产发展，从而根本改变了税收部门和生产单位的关系，群众给他们送锦旗，称赞他们是人民的“参谋”、“好干部”。在发展生产的基础上，第一季度两县的税务收入比去年同期增加23％，并且实现了税收无偷漏、无拖欠、无差错、无违反政策。
    税收工作能不能支持和促进生产发展？河南省有不少财政税务干部对这问题有怀疑。有的人认为组织生产是生产部门的事，税务部门就是收税要钱和监督开支，不应该或者不可能组织生产；有的人认为只有工农业生产跃进以后，财政税收工作才能跃进，甚至还有人认为工农业生产跃进给财政税收工作带来了先支后收的难题。但是，宝丰县和西平县的税务干部却以自己的实际行动教育了具有这些怀疑思想的人们，他们认为只要思想上明确树立了政治观点、生产观点和群众观点，税收工作在促进生产上大有可为，可以做的事很多，同时也只有在发展生产的基础上才能做好财政税收工作。
    这两个县的税务干部促进生产一般是从以下几方面进行的。首先，税务干部经常深入到农业社调查研究，帮助他们制订发展多种经济的规划，促进农村副业生产的发展。如宝丰县何庄村原有十多个炭池已经停止生产，农业社干部不愿恢复，税收干部就帮助农业社算劳力账、资金账、收入账，打通了农业社干部的思想，制定了恢复和发展生产的规划，决定除老炭池全部恢复生产外，再建二十个新炭池。这些炭池全部投入生产后，能年产炭一千零五十吨，产值四万二千元，这样既增加了农业社的收入，税局也可以征税二千九百四十元。
    在制订规划后，税务干部又经常深入生产单位，帮助他们解决生产经营中的资金、销路、原材料供应、财务账目等各方面的困难。对于这些困难，税务部门能解决的，就积极帮助解决，解决不了的，就代为往返奔走，联系有关单位，直到解决为止。宝丰县税务局自1957年以来，就帮助生产单位解决困难达八十多次。税收人员为了更好地指导和组织群众生产，还苦心钻研技术，使自己成为生产上的内行。如西平县的砖瓦窑原来都是手工操作，成本高，烧一窑砖需要十四天，合水税务所干部刘运华就同社员们共同研究，反复试制，终于创造成功用铁丝吊滑车的“快速运砖出窑法”，使运砖出窑效率提高十六倍，节省了大量人力。由于税务干部帮助群众解决了技术上的困难，农业社把他们当成了生产技术员，遇到问题就找他们商量。
    宝丰、西平两县的税务部门还根据生产的需要，改革了一些规章制度，简化了纳税手续。如对于一些资金少、生产有困难的厂矿与作坊，把原来产品出厂就报税的办法改为销售以后报税，使小型生产单位的资金能够周转得灵活些。过去厂矿、作坊到税收机关报税，要跑十多里路，现在改为税务干部到各单位办理征税手续，给生产单位以很大便利。
