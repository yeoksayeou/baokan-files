    Jinxi Coal Oil Refinery Starts Production
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinxi, 21st) The Ying Coal Oil Refinery in Jinxi County, Liaoning, has recently officially started production.

    This refinery is built in the remote mountainous area of Shaguotun Township, near small coal mines that use indigenous mining methods. The factory can produce 350 tons of crude oil annually, from which gasoline, kerosene, light diesel, heavy diesel, and by-products such as coke and asphalt can be refined. The factory equipment is simple. The coal-burning stoves are built with red bricks, mud, and a small amount of refractory bricks. The machines are just some small diesel engines and exhaust fans. Washing towers and oil deflectors are welded from scrap steel from local state-owned factories; if there is no scrap steel, they can also be replaced with bricks and cement.

    The investment for this type of small coal oil refinery generally only requires 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, can be built in half a month, and ordinary workers can quickly learn how to operate it. Jinxi County chose a remote mountainous area as the factory site in order to gain experience in building factories under conditions of inconvenient transportation, no power supply, and very poor technical strength.

    The Liaoning Provincial Department of Industry will, based on the experience of Jinxi County, establish small coal oil refineries on a large scale throughout the province. At present, more than 200 people from Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Hebei, and Jilin provinces have also come to the Jinxi Refinery to learn factory construction experience.

### 锦西煤炼油厂出油

    锦西煤炼油厂出油
    据新华社锦西21日电  辽宁锦西县营煤炼油厂最近正式投入生产。
    这个炼油厂建在偏僻的山区沙锅屯乡，附近有用土法开采的小煤窑。这个厂能年产三百五十吨原油，从中可以精炼出汽油、煤油、轻柴油、重柴油和副产品焦炭、沥青等。工厂设备简单。烧煤的炉子是用红砖、泥土和少量耐火砖砌成的土灶。机器只不过是一些小型柴油机和抽风机等。洗涤塔和挡油器是用当地国营工厂废钢铁料焊成的；如果没有废钢铁料，也可以用砖头和水泥来代替。
    这种小型煤炼油厂，投资一般只需要两三万元，半个月可以建成，普通工人很快就能学会操作。锦西县选择偏僻的山区作为厂址，是为了在交通不便、没有电源和技术力量很差的条件下，取得建厂的经验。
    辽宁省工业厅将根据锦西县的经验，在省内各地大办小型煤炼油厂。现在，湖南、湖北、安徽、河北和吉林等省也先后派来两百多人，到锦西炼油厂学习建厂经验。
