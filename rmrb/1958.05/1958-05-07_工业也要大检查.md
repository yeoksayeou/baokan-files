    Industry Also Needs a Major Inspection
    The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Hubei Provincial Party Committee have decided to conduct a major inspection of industrial production in May and June respectively. This measure is timely and very important.
    As agriculture makes a great leap forward, local industry must also make a great leap forward. Thorough inspection is needed to understand the situation, so as to make comprehensive plans and overall arrangements to prepare conditions for the great leap forward in local industry. This is an important task that needs to be started immediately. At the same time, inspection is a good way to grasp both ends and lead the middle, to grasp measures and grasp practical results. The Party committees in many regions widely adopted this method in this year's spring plowing, which powerfully promoted the upsurge of spring plowing. Now that the Hubei Provincial Party Committee and the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee are using this method to promote industrial production, it will certainly achieve great results. Such an inspection is equally necessary for all regions.

    工业也要大检查
    广东省委和湖北省委决定分别在5、6两月进行工业生产大检查。这项措施及时而且十分重要。
    农业在大跃进，地方工业也要大跃进。通过检查，摸清情况，以便全面规划，统筹安排，为地方工业大跃进准备条件，这是急待动手做的一项重要工作。同时，检查又是抓两头、带中间，抓措施、抓实效的好办法。许多地区的党委在今年的春耕工作中，曾经广泛地采取了这个办法，有力地推动了春耕高潮。现在湖北省委和广东省委用这个办法来促进工业生产，一定也会收到很大效果。进行这样一次检查，对各地来说同样是必要的。
