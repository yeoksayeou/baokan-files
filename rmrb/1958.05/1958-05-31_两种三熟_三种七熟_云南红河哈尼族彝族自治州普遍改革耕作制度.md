Two Kinds of Three Crops, Three Kinds of Seven Crops
Yunnan Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture Universally Reforms Cultivation System

    Yunnan Province's Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture is universally reforming its cultivation system. 90% of the prefecture's cultivated land is implementing a cultivation system that combines multiple cropping, intercropping, and planting high-yield crops.

    The autonomous prefecture has a mild climate and a very short frost season in winter, making it possible to develop double-cropping extensively. However, in previous years, most of the prefecture's more than three million mu of cultivated land only grew one season of spring crops, with a multiple cropping index of only 121%, far from realizing the land's potential. Since last year, many agricultural cooperatives in the autonomous prefecture have begun experimenting with multiple cropping, intercropping, and relay intercropping to grow multiple crops a year, with yields at least doubling compared to previous years. Last year, Chenguan Cooperative planted garlic, radishes, wheat, soybeans, sweet potatoes, corn, and broad beans on 38 mu of not very fertile dry land, averaging 1,370 jin of grain per mu (sweet potatoes converted to raw grain), and 1,000 jin of garlic and radishes each, with the output value per mu increasing more than five times compared to previous years. The Victory Cooperative in Shiping County experimented with planting five crops, including rice, broad beans, potatoes, peas, and corn, achieving a high-yield record of 2,150 jin of grain per mu. Quxi, Mengzi, Mile and other counties also successfully experimented last year with cultivation methods of intercropping or relay intercropping cash crops with grain crops, providing a direction for solving the grain problem in cash crop areas. To this end, the Honghe Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to universally promote a new cultivation system of two kinds of three crops to three kinds of seven crops throughout the prefecture, raising the multiple cropping index to about 20%.

    两种三熟　三种七熟
    云南红河哈尼族彝族自治州普遍改革耕作制度
    云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州普遍改革耕作制度。全州耕地面积中90％的田地，都推行多种多熟、复种、间作和种高产作物四管齐下的耕作制。
    自治州气候温和，冬季霜期很短，可以大量发展双季作物。但全州三百多万亩耕地，往年多数只种一季大春作物，复种指数只达121％，土地潜力远远没有发挥出来。去年以来，自治州许多农业社开始进行复种、间作、套种等一年多种多熟的试验，产量至少比往年增加一倍以上。陈官社去年在三十八亩不很肥沃的旱地里，分三季种了大蒜、萝卜、小麦、大豆、红薯、包谷、蚕豆等七种作物，平均每亩收粮食（红薯折合原粮计）一千三百七十斤，大蒜和萝卜各一千斤，每亩产值比往年增长五倍以上。石屏县胜利社试种的稻谷、蚕豆、洋芋、豌豆、包谷等五种作物，获得每亩产粮二千一百五十斤的高额丰产纪录。曲溪、蒙自、弥勒等县，也在去年分别试验成功了经济作物与粮食作物进行复种、间作或套种的耕作方法，为经济作物地区解决粮食问题提供了方向。为此，中共红河地委决定全州分别推行两种三熟至三种七熟的新耕作制，使复种指数提高到20％左右。　（张廷干）
