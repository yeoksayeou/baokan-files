　　Chengdu, May 16th - The ammonium sulfate produced by indigenous methods in Fengjie County is showing great power in the fields. The more than 3,000 mu of rice seedlings, whose roots were soaked in the locally produced fertilizer in the first batch used throughout the county, generally turned green five days earlier and the seedlings were particularly strong. In Xinmin District, agricultural cooperatives used ammonium sulfate to promote seedling growth, and the seedlings grew very quickly, allowing for transplanting ten days earlier. In various places, this type of ammonium sulfate was used as a top dressing on sweet potato, corn, and cotton fields, greatly promoting faster seedling growth. After application to 5,000 mu of sweet potatoes, they all grew better than those fertilized with natural fertilizers. The kohlrabi in the experimental plot of the Fengjie County Party Committee produced 30% more after application of ammonium sulfate than those fertilized with human and animal manure.

　　Neighboring counties also received the same results after using Fengjie's ammonium sulfate. Yan Hanmin, Secretary of the Wanxian Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to test the fertilizer effect of this locally produced ammonium sulfate, applied it to the worst-growing row of wheat in a wheat field. After ten days, the wheat seedlings became better than those around them. Some places used it in comparison with ammonium sulfate produced by state-owned factories, and the effect was the same.

　　奉节土化肥大显威风
    本报成都16日电　奉节县土法制造的硫酸铵在田间大显威风。全县第一批使用土化肥浸过秧根的三千多亩稻苗，普遍提前五天转青，苗架分外茁壮。新民区各农业社施用硫酸铵催秧苗，秧苗长得很快，提前十天栽了秧。各地用这种硫酸铵作追肥，施于红薯、玉米、棉花地里，也大大促使秧苗加快生长。五千亩红薯施上后，都比施用自然肥料的长得好。中共奉节县委会试验田里的牛皮菜，施用硫酸铵后，比施人畜粪的多产30％。
    邻近各县用了奉节的硫酸铵以后，也都收到了同样的效果。中共万县地委书记燕汉民为了检验这种土法制造的硫酸铵的肥效，曾把它施在麦田中生长最坏的一行麦子里，经过十天以后，麦苗变得比周围的都好。有些地方把它和国营工厂生产的硫酸铵对比使用，效果一样。
