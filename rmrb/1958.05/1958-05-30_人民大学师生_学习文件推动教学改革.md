Renmin University Faculty and Students
Study Documents to Promote Teaching Reform

(Our dispatch) Renmin University has decided to vigorously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and publicize the general line of socialist construction in order to promote the current major reform of teaching. On the evening of the 27th, the Chinese Communist Party Committee of Renmin University convened a meeting of the general branch secretaries of each department to specifically discuss this issue.

The Party Committee has initially decided that all faculty and students will spend more than a week reading and discussing Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report. Teachers should consider the major reform of teaching and scientific research in conjunction with their studies.
