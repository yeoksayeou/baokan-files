Editorial: Rely on the Masses to Propagate Improved Varieties

Since liberation, the area sown with improved varieties in our country has continuously expanded. In 1949, the national area sown with improved varieties was only ten million mu, but it reached 130 million mu in 1952, and further expanded to 1.3 billion mu in 1957, accounting for 56% of the total sown area of crops nationwide. It is expected to reach 1.75 billion mu in 1958, accounting for 73% of the total sown area of crops nationwide. In recent years, more than 700 improved varieties have been promoted, generally increasing production by about 15%, with some reaching more than double. This has played a significant role in increasing agricultural production in our country, and the masses welcome it.

However, due to the failure to fundamentally arrange seed work following the development of cooperativization, a phenomenon of the masses relying on the government, lower levels relying on higher levels, and large-scale transfers and shipments has formed in the past two or three years. This is not only passive in work, but also because most of the seeds transferred are commercial grain, the varieties are mixed, the germination rate is not high, and the varieties are often not entirely suitable for the local environment; at the same time, the losses and waste in transportation are also very serious. Since the Great Leap Forward this year, production conditions such as water conservancy and fertilizers have been greatly improved. This situation poses many new problems for seed work: not only is a large quantity of improved varieties required, with many varieties, but also varieties that are more resistant to fertilizer, water, and disease, and suitable for mechanical cultivation. If these problems cannot be solved in time, they will hinder the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

Our country has a vast territory, extremely complex natural conditions, and very different cropping systems in various regions. Agricultural production cooperatives across the country need approximately 30 billion jin of seeds each year. Can the state take care of such a large quantity and diverse types of seeds that must be adapted to various regions? Obviously not, and it should not be done this way. Only by relying on the masses can we solve the problem. Experience has proven that agricultural production cooperatives are capable of doing and doing well in this area. For example, the Luqiao No. 1 Cooperative in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, has relied on its own seed selection and propagation of improved varieties for several years, popularizing improved varieties, improving seed quality, and continuously increasing yields. It became a thousand-jin cooperative as early as 1956, and also supported many fraternal cooperatives in the county with a lot of improved varieties, enabling everyone to increase production, thus gaining everyone's support. Nehe County, Heilongjiang Province, organized a network for promoting improved varieties, adopting the method of multi-point demonstration, local propagation, and local promotion, turning inferior varieties into improved varieties and changing low yields into high yields, achieving popularization in one year and replacement in two years, achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results. Such examples exist everywhere. As long as we summarize and promote these experiences, they will blossom and bear fruit everywhere.

Establishing seed plots by agricultural production cooperatives is the fundamental way to propagate, select, and use seeds independently. Agricultural cooperatives breed their own seeds for use in seed plots every year and continuously refine the selection, selecting even better seeds from improved varieties, which can ensure a sufficient supply of seeds and gradually improve them. Much work has been done in these areas in the past; however, in some places, when establishing seed plots, they did not consult with the masses properly, did not carry out ideological education work, and did not combine with the actual interests of the masses, but adopted administrative command methods; or seed plots were established, but specific issues such as labor remuneration were not resolved; and more often, the role of experienced old farmers was not fully utilized, so the results were not significant. In the future, we must address the shortcomings of the past, improve them, and make seed plots truly become the base for agricultural cooperatives to propagate improved varieties.

Our country is an agricultural country with a long history, and there are very rich crop varieties and experienced old farmers who meticulously cultivate varieties everywhere. According to incomplete data from the Ministry of Agriculture, more than 180,000 copies of farmers' varieties have been collected. Farmers have newly selected and bred nearly 70 varieties since liberation. Among the more than 700 varieties currently being promoted, 440 are farmers' varieties. This fully shows that the variety resources among the masses are rich and the wisdom of the masses is infinite. As long as we firmly believe in the masses, actively lead, we will discover more excellent varieties, cultivate more farmer breeders, and do a good job in seed work.

Secondly, in order to solve the problem of seeds needed for expanding planting and changing systems in various regions or the lack of improved varieties in cooperatives, the state must also do seed adjustment work. The state should establish a set of improved variety propagation system: agricultural scientific research institutions (including higher agricultural colleges) should actively carry out seed selection, breeding, and original seed propagation work. Special county "demonstration propagation farms" should propagate "promoted seeds" for use in agricultural cooperative seed plots; and establish improved variety propagation bases in suitable areas according to needs. In this way, the state only needs to supply agricultural cooperative seed plots with 1.5 to 2 billion jin of seeds each year, which can continuously improve the quality of seeds in agricultural cooperatives. Now the improved variety management work has been transferred to the unified management of the Ministry of Agriculture, which makes it easier to plan and do a good job in the supply and adjustment of improved varieties, and gradually overcome the phenomenon of temporary, blind, large-scale transportation, resulting in backlog and waste of improved varieties.

Agricultural scientific research institutions have done a lot of work in cultivating improved varieties, but it is far from meeting the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Further efforts should be made to cultivate more and better new varieties. In the past, agricultural scientific research institutions had conservative ideas, individualism, and a style of being divorced from reality and production, which hindered the development of their work. They must be overcome with a revolutionary spirit, go to the vast fields, learn from farmers, guide farmers, closely integrate with the masses, and make greater contributions.

In addition, there have been some biases in the selection and breeding of new varieties and the promotion of improved varieties in the past, such as focusing on major crops such as rice, wheat, and cotton, and neglecting sorghum, millet, foxtail millet, and broomcorn millet; focusing on plains and neglecting mountainous areas; and the homogenization of varieties. These biases are also the result of not following the mass line well, and must be corrected in future work.

### 依靠群众繁殖良种

　　依靠群众繁殖良种
    解放以来，我国良种面积不断扩大。1949年全国良种面积仅一千万亩，1952年就达到了一亿三千万亩，1957年更扩大到十三亿亩，占全国作物播种总面积的56％。1958年将达到十七亿五千万亩，占全国作物总播种面积的73％。几年来推广了优良品种七百多个，一般增产15％左右，高的达到一倍以上。这对我国农业的增产起了很大作用，群众十分欢迎。
    但是，由于没有跟着合作化的发展，从根本上安排种子工作，以致两三年来形成群众靠政府、下级靠上级和大调大运的现象。这不仅工作上被动，而且由于所调的种子大部分是商品粮，品种混杂，发芽率不高，品种也往往不尽适合当地环境；同时，调运中的损失浪费也很严重。今年大跃进以来，水利、肥料等生产条件有了很大的改善，这种形势给种子工作提出许多新的问题：不仅要求良种数量大，品种多，而且要求更能耐肥、耐水、抗病和适于机械耕作。这些问题如果不能及时解决，就会阻碍农业生产大跃进。
    我国地区辽阔，自然条件十分复杂，各地耕作制度极不相同，全国农业生产合作社每年大约需要三百亿斤种子。这样数量很大而又必须适应于各个不同地区的种类繁多的种子，能不能由国家包下来呢？显然不能，而且也不应当这样做。只有依靠群众才能解决。经验证明，这方面的工作，农业生产合作社是能够做得了也能够做得好的。比如浙江省黄岩县路桥一社几年来就是依靠自己选种，自己繁殖良种，普及了良种，还提高了种子质量，产量不断提高，从1956年就成为千斤社，还支援了本县许多兄弟社不少良种，使大家都增了产，因而得到大家拥护。黑龙江讷河县组织良种推广网，采用多点示范，就地繁殖，就地推广的办法，变劣种为良种，由低产变高产，一年普及，二年即行更换，做到了多、快、好、省。这种事例各地都有。只要我们把这些经验加以总结推广，就会遍地开花结果。
    农业生产合作社建立种子地，是自繁自选自用的根本办法。农业合作社在种子地里每年繁育自己所用的种子，并不断进行精选，从良种中再选良种，就可以保证有足够的种子，并逐步提高。过去在这些方面作了不少工作；但是也有一些地方建立种子地时，没有和群众好好商量，不进行思想教育工作，不结合群众实际利益，而采取行政命令的办法；或者种子地建立起来了，但没有解决劳动报酬之类的具体问题；更多的是没有充分发挥有经验的老农的作用，因而效果不显著。今后必须针对过去的缺点，加以改进，使种子地切实成为农业合作社繁育良种的基地。
    我国是一个历史悠久的农业国家，作物品种十分丰富，精心培育品种的老农也到处都有。据农业部不完全的资料，农家品种已经征集了十八万多份。解放以来农民新选育的品种已近七十个。现在推广的七百多个品种中，有四百四十个是农家品种。这充分说明群众中的品种资源是丰富的，群众的智慧是无穷的。只要坚决相信群众，积极领导，就会发掘出更多的优良品种，培养出更多的农民选种家，把种子工作做好。
    其次，为了解决各地扩种改制所需要的种子或合作社缺少的良种，国家还要做良种调剂工作。国家应当建立一套良种繁育制度：农业科学研究机关（包括高等农业院校）应该积极进行选种、育种和原种繁育工作。专县“示范繁殖场”要繁殖“推广种”，供给农业社种子地使用；并根据需要，在适宜的地区建立良种繁殖基地。这样，国家每年只要供应农业社种子地十五至二十亿斤种子，就可以不断地提高农业社种子的质量。现在良种经营工作已经划归农业部统一管理，更便于有计划地做好良种供应调剂工作，逐渐克服临时盲目大量调运，以致积压和浪费良种等现象。
    农业科学研究机关在培育良种方面已经做了不少工作，但还远不能适应农业生产大跃进的需要。应该作进一步的努力，培育更多更好的新品种。以往农业科学研究机关存在着保守思想、个人主义和脱离实际脱离生产的作风，阻碍了他们工作的发展，必须用革命的精神加以克服，走到广大田野，一面向农民学习，一面指导农民，和群众密切结合，做出更大的贡献。
    此外，过去在选育新品种和推广良种方面还存在着一些偏向，如偏重稻麦棉等主要作物，轻视高粱、谷子、糜、黍等；偏重平原，忽视山区；以及品种单一化等。这些偏向也是没有很好地走群众路线的结果，今后工作中还须加以纠正。
