Xinhua News Agency, May 21st dispatch from Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles's remarks at a press conference on May 20th once again proved that the United States is actively plotting further intervention in the situation in Lebanon.

Dulles had to admit that Lebanon was not threatened by any "communist aggression," but he stated that the "Eisenhower Doctrine" could be used as the "basis" for U.S. intervention in Lebanon.

To create a pretext for U.S. intervention in the Lebanese situation, Dulles also used the usual American trick of insisting that there was "seemingly serious evidence" that the United Arab Republic was "interfering" in the Lebanese situation.

Dulles excused the embarrassing situation of U.S. Vice President Nixon being reviled and chased in Latin American countries. He stated that his own experiences abroad were no better than Nixon's.

Dulles admitted that anti-American sentiment in Latin American countries was caused by some "economic and political factors" of dissatisfaction with the United States. However, he attributed it to "communist instigation."

Referring to the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan's hostile policy towards China and its deliberate sabotage of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Dulles echoed Kishi Nobusuke's slanders, falsely accusing China's solemn protests against the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile actions towards China of having "political intentions."

    杜勒斯又叫嚣干涉黎巴嫩
    同时为岸信介诬蔑中国的谰言帮腔
    据新华社21日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯5月20日在记者招待会上的谈话再一次证明，美国正在积极策划进一步干涉黎巴嫩的局势。
    杜勒斯不得不承认，黎巴嫩并没有受到什么“共产主义侵略”的威胁，但是，他表示，“艾森豪威尔主义”可以被用来作为美国干涉黎巴嫩的“根据”。
    为了替美国干涉黎巴嫩局势制造借口，杜勒斯还使用了美国的惯技，硬说有“看来很严重的证据”证明阿拉伯联合共和国在“干涉”黎巴嫩局势。
    杜勒斯替美国副总统尼克松在拉丁美洲国家被人唾骂、追打的狼狈处境解嘲。他表示，他在国外的遭遇，比尼克松好不了多少。
    杜勒斯承认，拉丁美洲国家的反美情绪是由于对美国不满的一些“经济和政治因素”所引起的。但是，他又把它说成是受“共产党的鼓动”。
    在谈到日本岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策、蓄意破坏中日第四次贸易协定时，杜勒斯附和岸信介的谰言，把中国对岸信介政府敌视中国的行动所表示的严正抗议诬蔑为有“政治意图”。
