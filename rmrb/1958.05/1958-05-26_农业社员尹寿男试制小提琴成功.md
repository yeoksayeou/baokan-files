Xinhua News Agency report:

    An violin maker has emerged in a remote mountain valley in Hunchun County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. He is Yin Shounan, a young Korean member of the Madida Agricultural Cooperative.

    Yin Shounan is eighteen years old this year and joined agricultural production after graduating from senior primary school in 1954. He usually enjoys engraving and doing some fine woodworking after finishing his farm work. This year, the cooperative actively launched amateur cultural and recreational activities, but there was a shortage of musical instruments. So, after more than four months of repeated research and experimentation, Yin Shounan finally produced a violin with good tone and beautiful style.

    农业社员尹寿男试制小提琴成功
    在延边朝鲜族自治州珲春县的一个偏僻的山沟里，出现了一个小提琴制造师。他是马滴达农业社的朝鲜族青年社员尹寿男。
    尹寿男今年十八岁，是1954年高小毕业后参加农业生产的。他平日在干完农活以后，很喜欢刻字和做一些木工细活。今年社内积极开展业余文化娱乐活动，但是乐器不足。于是尹寿男经过四个多月的反复钻研和试验，一把音色较好、样式美观的小提琴终于制成了。
