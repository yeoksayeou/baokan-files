Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 18th Dispatch from TASS: The note delivered by the Soviet government to the Japanese government on the 15th has aroused widespread reaction in Japan. All sectors of Japanese society attach great importance to the issues raised in the Soviet note. The Japanese people have expressed deep anxiety about the news of atomic weapons being stored in Japanese territory and tools for transporting such weapons.

Official sources are trying to create the impression that Soviet concerns are unfounded. However, the broad public in Japan holds a different opinion. According to a Tokyo radio report, Sanzo Nosaka, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, mentioned in a speech in Osaka on the 16th the statement made by Foreign Minister Aiichiro Fujiyama in the previous Diet session. The Foreign Minister said that the United States, based on the so-called Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and "Administrative Agreement," has the right to transport atomic weapons into Japan. Nosaka pointed out that if the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet denies that there are nuclear weapons in Japanese territory, then the ruling Liberal Democratic Party should accept the proposal made by the Socialist Party to jointly issue a statement declaring Japan a nuclear weapon-free zone.

Secretary-General of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mozaburo Suzuki, said at a press conference on the 16th that the Soviet government issued a warning based on Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's ambiguous reply, and Nobusuke Kishi could not guarantee that the United States would not equip U.S. troops stationed in Japan with nuclear weapons. Mozaburo Suzuki said that the Japanese people want to know for certain whether Japan will stockpile nuclear weapons.

　　日本公众重视苏联照会
    对日本储存核武器问题感到不安
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社东京17日讯：苏联政府在15日交给日本政府的照会在日本引起了广泛的反应。日本各界对苏联照会中所提出的问题极为重视。日本人民对在日本境内储存原子武器和载运这种武器的工具的消息表示深切的不安。
    官方人士企图造成一种印象，好像苏联的焦虑是没有根据的。但是，日本广大公众阶层却持着另一种意见。据东京电台报道，日本共产党中央第一书记野坂参三16日在大阪发表演说时提到外务相藤山爱一郎在上届国会中所发表的声明。这位外务相说，美国根据所谓日美“安全条约”和“行政协定”有权把原子武器运入日本。野坂参三指出，如果岸信介内阁否认日本境内有核武器，那么执政的自由民主党就应当接受社会党提出的建议，共同发表声明宣布日本为无原子武器地区。
    日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎16日在记者招待会上说，苏联政府提出警告，是根据岸信介首相暧昧不清的答复作出的，岸信介不能保证美国不会用核武器装备美国驻扎在日本的军队。铃木茂三郎说，日本人民希望肯定地知道，日本是否要储存核武器。
