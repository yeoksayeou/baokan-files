　　To ensure full seedling emergence per mu and strong seedlings in every plot
　　Cotton-Growing Areas Launch Mid-Cultivation and Pest Control Activities
    This newspaper reports that the agricultural cooperatives in the vast cotton-growing areas, following the cotton sowing, have launched a high tide of cotton field management.

    Currently, in the cotton-growing areas of the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, most cotton fields have emerged. The cotton seedlings are generally growing uniformly and vigorously, emerging earlier and more uniformly than in previous years, with some early-sown cotton already showing true leaves. According to statistics from Shandong Province, a major cotton-growing area in the north, on May 7th: 90% of the cotton fields in the Heze area have emerged uniformly, and 80% in the Liaocheng area have emerged uniformly; many cotton plants sown around April 10th already have true leaves. According to statistics from 19 counties, including Qingfeng in Henan Province, by the end of April, 90% of the cotton fields had also emerged uniformly. Cotton sown in early April in provinces such as Hunan has seedlings that are four inches tall. In cotton-growing areas with later seasons, such as the Liao River basin in Northeast China and the Manas River basin in northern Xinjiang, cotton seedlings have also begun to break through the soil, with some cotton fields already showing seedlings.

    To ensure that every mu sown yields a harvest, and that every plot has full and strong seedlings, various effective measures were quickly taken in various places after the sowing was completed. After the basic completion of sowing, the Linqing County Party Committee and County People's Committee in Shandong Province immediately organized 1,360 groups consisting of more than 6,000 county, township, and cooperative cadres, as well as experienced veteran farmers, to conduct block-by-block inspections of all cotton fields in the county. When problems were discovered, measures were studied and remedies were implemented on the spot. Counties such as Tianmen, Mianyang, and Macheng in Hubei Province adopted the "double insurance" method, on the one hand, checking and replanting directly sown fields, and on the other hand, increasing the number of reserve cotton seedlings cultivated to meet the needs of transplanting. Many agricultural cooperatives in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Anhui, and other provinces, in addition to supplementing watering and compaction measures for cotton fields lacking moisture, also cultivated a large number of cotton seedlings for transplanting.

    Many cotton-growing areas with uniform seedling emergence are seizing the time to carry out early mid-cultivation of cotton fields. Many areas began the first mid-cultivation immediately after the cotton seedlings emerged. According to statistics from three counties in Henan Province—Huoqiu, Qingfeng, and Xinye—more than 110,000 mu of cotton fields had been cultivated by April 25th; some agricultural cooperatives in Meng County had begun or completed the second mid-cultivation and started the third mid-cultivation. Linqing County in Shandong Province organized 100,000 cooperative members to engage in cotton field cultivation. Early-sown cotton fields in the Aksu Reclamation Area of Xinjiang have also undergone the first mid-cultivation.

    According to the cotton insect prediction report from the Anyang Working Group of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, cotton aphids will appear early this year, and the damage may be more severe than in previous years. Many regions have also launched activities to eliminate cotton aphids on woody hosts ahead of time, based on the early occurrence of cotton pests this year. According to statistics from 11 counties in Henan Province, more than 710,000 woody hosts such as pomegranates, hibiscus, and Chinese peppers have been sprayed with pesticides. The Xinxiang area convened a special meeting on April 20th to organize forces, prepare medicines and machinery, and promote cotton pest control. In areas where cutworms have historically caused severe damage, efforts have also been stepped up to use syrup to trap adult moths. According to statistics from Xinxiang County on April 23rd, 550,000 adult cutworm moths have been trapped. Yongnian and other counties in Hebei Province mobilized the masses to carry out weeding and aphid prevention work as early as possible.

    To ensure uniform and strong seedlings, many areas have carried out thinning and supplementary fertilization based on the density, vigor, and weakness of cotton seedlings. Some areas have reviewed the drainage and irrigation projects of cotton fields, as well as water lifting tools, to ensure that cotton fields can be irrigated in a timely manner and drained smoothly.

    This year, some cotton-growing areas have also experienced uneven seedling emergence due to dry weather and poor soil moisture before and after sowing. According to reports from Sichuan, cotton fields generally lack 15%-20% of seedlings. In parts of Handan and Shijiazhuang in Hebei Province, the lack of seedlings and broken ridges in cotton fields is also more serious. In some individual townships and cooperatives in some areas, the work of checking and replanting seedlings, mid-cultivation, and pest control has been slow and has not been actively carried out. Many areas with such situations have begun to pay attention to this loophole in high cotton yields and have taken remedial measures.

### 争取亩亩苗全、块块苗壮  棉区展开中耕除虫活动

　　争取亩亩苗全、块块苗壮
　　棉区展开中耕除虫活动
    本报讯　广大棉区的农业社紧接着棉花播种以后，又掀起了棉田管理的高潮。
    目前，黄河流域、长江流域棉区，大部分棉田已经出苗。棉苗一般生长整齐茁壮，较往年出得早，出得齐，部分早播的已现真叶。据北方主要棉区之一山东省5月7日的统计：菏泽专区90％的棉田已经齐苗，聊城专区80％已经齐苗；许多在4月10日左右播种的棉花，已见真叶。另据河南清丰等十九个县4月底的统计，90％的棉田也已齐苗。湖南等省在4月上旬播种的棉花，已苗高四寸。季节较迟的东北辽河流域和北疆玛纳斯河流域等棉区，棉苗也已开始拱土，部分棉田棉苗已经现行。
    为保证种一亩，出一亩，亩亩苗全、块块苗壮，各地在播种完了以后很快地采取了各种有效措施。山东省临清县委和县人民委员会在播种基本结束后，立即组织了包括六千多县、乡、社干部和有经验老农的一千三百六十个小组，对全县所有棉田进行逐块检查，发现问题，就地研究措施，进行补救。湖北天门、沔阳、麻城等县都采取了
  “双保险”办法，一面对直播田进行查苗补种，一面增加培育预备棉苗的数量，以满足移苗补植的需要。河南、山东、河北、安徽等省不少农业社，对缺墒的棉田，除进行补浇接墒和补行镇压等措施外，也大量培育了准备移补用的棉苗。
    许多出苗整齐的棉区正抓紧进行棉田早期中耕。许多地区在棉田现行后即开始了第一次中耕。据河南省获嘉、清丰、新野等三县统计，到4月25日，已中耕棉田十一万多亩；孟县的一些农业社，已开始第二次中耕或完成第二次中耕，开始了第三次中耕。山东省临清县组织了十万社员投入棉田中耕。新疆阿克苏垦区的早播棉田也已进行了第一次中耕。
    根据中国科学院安阳工作组棉虫预测报道，今年棉蚜发生早，为害可能比前几年严重。许多地区也已根据今年棉虫发生早的情况提前开展了杀除木本寄主上的棉蚜活动。据河南省十一个县的统计，已用药喷射石榴、木槿、花椒等木本寄主七十一万多株。新乡专区在4月20日召开了专门会议，组织力量，准备药械，推动棉虫防治工作。历年地老虎为害较重的地区，还抓紧了用糖浆诱杀成虫的工作。据新乡县4月23日统计，已诱杀地老虎成虫（蛾）五十五万个。河北永年等县，发动群众及早开展了除草防蚜工作。
    为确保苗匀、苗壮，不少地区已根据棉苗的稠、密、壮、弱，进行了疏苗和补施肥料等工作。部分地区对棉田的排涝和灌溉工程，以及提水工具，进行了复查，以保证棉田能及时灌溉和顺利排涝。
    今年也有部分棉区，由于气候干旱播种前后土墒不好等原因，出苗不齐。据四川反映，棉田一般缺苗15％—20％。河北省邯郸、石家庄等部分地区棉田缺苗断垅也较严重。还有部分地区个别乡、社对棉田的查苗补种和中耕、治虫等工作行动缓慢，没有积极进行，不少有这样情况的地区，已开始注意了棉花丰产的这一漏洞，并采取了补课措施。
