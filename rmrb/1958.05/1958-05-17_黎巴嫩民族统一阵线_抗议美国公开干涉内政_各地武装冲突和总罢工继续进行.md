Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th. According to reports, the Lebanese National United Front delivered a memorandum to the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon on the 15th, protesting against the U.S. government's open interference in Lebanese internal affairs.

The memorandum stated, "We were very surprised when we read in the newspapers the summary of your remarks at the press conference held at the U.S. Embassy yesterday, in which you said that the government in Washington would support the Lebanese government with aid."

The memorandum stated, we believe it is our responsibility to point out to you that the U.S. government's open interference in Lebanese internal affairs is enough to unite all elements opposing the current Lebanese government against the U.S. government.

The memorandum added that the current struggle of the Lebanese people "is purely an internal affair and does not come from outside."

Meanwhile, according to Lebanese newspapers, a conference of all Lebanese parties and organizations issued a statement refuting Foreign Minister Malik's statement regarding the United Arab Republic's "interference" in Lebanese internal affairs. The statement said that the Lebanese Foreign Minister is putting all the responsibility for the Lebanese domestic events on the United Arab Republic, while Lebanese leaders are beginning talks with the ambassadors of Western countries on the adoption of the U.S., British, and French "Tripartite Declaration" and the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

The conference of all Lebanese parties and organizations deems it its duty to make the following statement: The uprisings in various parts of Lebanon are people's uprisings, and the sole purpose of the uprisings is to consolidate Lebanon's independence, defend its independence, and create conditions of equality, justice, and friendship for all Lebanese people.

The statement pointed out that attempts to shift the responsibility for the Lebanese events to others are untenable. The statement pointed out: "The best solution is to stop the bloodshed and for those responsible for the events to resign."

The statement was signed by: the National Bloc, the Supporters Party, the Socialist Progressive Party, the Constitutional Party of the big bourgeoisie, the National Front, and representatives of the free press.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 16th. According to a Middle East News Agency reporter's dispatch from Beirut on the evening of the 15th, on May 15th, the seventh day since anti-government demonstrations successively broke out in various parts of Lebanon on the 9th, armed clashes between the people and the security forces continued in the capital Beirut and several other cities in northern and southern Lebanon, and the general strike was still in progress.

The Middle East News Agency said that several explosions occurred near Prime Minister Solh's residence and the famous High Tower Square in Beirut on the 15th. Ten people were killed and thirty injured in the explosions at High Tower Square.

The Lebanese National United Front, composed of many opposition parties, reiterated its call in a statement on the 15th, saying that the strike would continue until President Chamoun and the government resign.

Meanwhile, newspapers reported on the activities of armed insurgents in the Hermel Mountains and other parts of the country. Official bulletins indicated that government forces engaged in combat with insurgents in the Shouf Mountains and the Beit ed-Dine area. Insurgents blew up many bridges, railways, and telephone lines in various places. Telephone connections between Lebanon and other Arab countries (except Iraq) have been cut off. Communication between Beirut and many other cities in the country has also been interrupted. Reports say that insurgents have taken control of an airport north of Tripoli.

According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington on the 15th, Lebanon's pro-Western government has requested the United States to supply a batch of tanks to suppress the demonstrators.

　　黎巴嫩民族统一阵线
　　抗议美国公开干涉内政
　　各地武装冲突和总罢工继续进行
    新华社大马士革16日电　据报道，黎巴嫩民族统一阵线在15日交给美国驻黎巴嫩大使一项备忘录，抗议美国政府公开干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    备忘录说，“当我们在报纸上读到你昨天在美国大使馆举行的记者招待会的谈话的摘要时，我们感到非常惊奇，你在昨天的记者招待会上说，华盛顿政府将以援助支持黎巴嫩政府。”
    备忘录说，我们认为有责任向你指出，美国政府公开干涉黎巴嫩内政，足以使一切反对黎巴嫩现政府的分子团结起来反对美国政府。
    备忘录又说，目前黎巴嫩人民的斗争“纯粹是内部事务，而不是从外面来的。”
    同时，据黎巴嫩报纸报道，黎巴嫩全国各党派及团体会议发表声明，驳斥外交部长马利克关于阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”黎巴嫩内政的声明。声明说，黎巴嫩外交部长把黎巴嫩国内事件的全部责任都推到阿拉伯联合共和国身上，而同时黎巴嫩领导人却同西方国家的大使就采纳美、英、法“三国宣言”和“艾森豪威尔主义”问题开始会谈。
    黎巴嫩全国各党派及团体会议认为有责任作如下声明：黎巴嫩各地的起义是人民起义，起义的唯一目的是要巩固黎巴嫩的独立，保卫它的独立，并为所有黎巴嫩人创造平等、正义和友爱的条件。
    声明指出，想把黎巴嫩事件的责任推到别人身上的企图是站不住脚的。声明指出：“最好的解决办法是：停止流血和应对事件负责的人辞职。”
    在声明上签字的有：民族集团、支持者党、社会主义进步党、大资产阶级的立宪党、民族阵线以及自由报刊的代表。
    据新华社大马士革16日电　据中东通讯社记者15日晚上从贝鲁特报道，5月15日，也就是黎巴嫩各地从9日相继发生反政府示威运动以来的第七天，在首都贝鲁特和黎巴嫩北部和南部的其他几个城市，人民和保安部队继续发生武装冲突，总罢工仍在进行中。
    中东通讯社说，在总理索勒哈的住宅和贝鲁特著名的高塔广场曾经在15日发生几次爆炸。在高塔广场的爆炸中有十人被炸死，三十人受伤。
    由许多反对党派组成的黎巴嫩民族统一阵线15日在声明中重申它的号召说，罢工将继续到夏蒙总统和政府辞职时为止。
    同时，报纸报道了武装起义队伍在赫麦尔山区和国内其他地区的活动。官方公报指出，政府军同起义者在舒弗山区和贝特丁地区进行了战斗。起义者炸毁了许多地方的桥梁、铁路和电话线。黎巴嫩同其他阿拉伯国家（伊拉克除外）的电话联系已被切断。贝鲁特同国内许多其他城市之间的联系也已中断，有消息说，起义者已经控制了的黎波里北部的一个机场。
    另据合众社15日发自华盛顿的一条消息透露，黎巴嫩的亲西方政府已经要求美国供应一批坦克来镇压示威者。
