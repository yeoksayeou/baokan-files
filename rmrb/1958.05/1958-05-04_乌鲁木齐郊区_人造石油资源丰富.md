Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 3rd – The suburbs of Urumqi City, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have abundant artificial petroleum resources. According to preliminary drilling by the Xinjiang Geological Bureau, the oil shale mines in Yaomo Mountain, Lucao Gou, and Shuimo Gou in the suburbs of the city have an estimated recoverable reserve of more than 200 million tons. The oil content of these oil shales is generally above 6%, with the highest reaching more than 20%, making them good raw materials for refining artificial petroleum. Most of the ore layers are covered very shallowly and can be mined in open pits.

The Xinjiang Geological Bureau also tested the coal from the coalfields in the suburbs of Urumqi. The test results proved that the coal buried in this coalfield can also be used to refine artificial petroleum.

    乌鲁木齐郊区
    人造石油资源丰富
    新华社乌鲁木齐3日电　新疆维吾尔自治区乌鲁木齐市郊区有丰富的人造石油资源。经新疆地质局的初步钻探，市郊妖魔山、芦草沟、水磨沟等地的油母页岩矿，可采储量估计有两亿吨以上。这些油母页岩的含油量一般都在6％以上，最高的达20％多，是炼制人造石油的好原料。大部分矿层覆盖很浅，可以露天开采。
    新疆地质局还化验了乌鲁木齐市郊煤田的煤。化验结果证明这个煤田埋藏的煤也可以用来炼制人造石油。
