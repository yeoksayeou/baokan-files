Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. In the high tide of the nationwide leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, many new problems have emerged in handicraft production. Recently, a Xinhua News Agency reporter interviewed Deng Jie, Deputy Director of the All-China Handicraft Cooperative Association, on the issue of technological revolution in handicrafts and the future direction of the handicraft cooperative movement, and asked him to express his views on these two issues.

Deng Jie first talked about the issue of technological revolution in handicrafts. He said that a prominent contradiction currently exists in handicraft industries across the country, namely, the backward mode of handicraft production and low technological level, which cannot meet the requirements of the leap forward in agricultural production and the development of local industries. According to statistics, there are currently only 40,000 to 50,000 sets of machinery and equipment in handicraft cooperatives across the country, and the degree of mechanization is only about 3% according to units; labor productivity is very low, with the average annual output value per worker in general state-owned modern large-scale industries being about 20,000 to 30,000 yuan; mechanized cooperatives, 10,000 to 15,000 yuan per person per year; semi-mechanized cooperatives, 5,000 to 8,000 yuan; and general cooperatives with less than 100 people, only 2,000 to 3,000 yuan per person per year. Therefore, it is necessary to widely carry out a mass technological revolution movement in the handicraft system, vigorously improve tools and equipment, improve the technological level, and accelerate the development towards semi-mechanization and mechanization.

Deng Jie said that there used to be a debate about whether handicrafts should implement semi-mechanization and mechanization. Now it seems that about 70% of the handicrafts nationwide can develop towards semi-mechanization and mechanization through technological transformation; the remaining 30%, such as arts and crafts products and handicrafts that serve the people's lives, will retain the manual production method for a long time, except for some technological innovations in certain production tools and individual processes. Therefore, most handicrafts will develop into mechanized industries through technological revolution, and a part of handicrafts will still be preserved. This is the unity of contradictions between mechanization, semi-mechanization, and handicrafts.

Regarding the steps of technological revolution in handicrafts and the cultivation of technical forces, Deng Jie said that the steps of technological revolution in handicrafts, from the perspective of a cooperative, should start from reducing heavy physical labor and from the weakest links in the production process, so that technological transformation can be combined with the personal requirements of the members and become a mass movement. From a national perspective, key industries such as machinery, electricity, iron, and wood in large and medium-sized cities should take the lead, and cooperatives in these industries should be armed first if conditions permit, so that they can manufacture various machine tools and electrical equipment needed by handicraft cooperatives below the special zone and county levels and local small and medium-sized industries. This can not only solve the technological transformation problems of the handicraft cooperatives themselves, but also supplement the shortage of machine equipment production in state-owned large-scale industries and meet the needs of county, township, and commune-run local industries. Therefore, it is currently urgent to strengthen the technical equipment strength of these key cooperatives so that "the hen can lay eggs."

Deng Jie said that the lack of technical strength in handicraft cooperatives is an important issue in the process of technological revolution, and all regions should adopt self-reliance methods and not have a dependence mentality. The main method is to use masters to train apprentices, supplemented by necessary classroom lectures, to train a large number of young apprentices. Handicraft cadre schools in various provinces and cities can cooperate with the industrial departments to train a group of technicians, or entrust qualified schools to train a group of technicians, or combine with work-study programs in universities and colleges. Sending people to study abroad is also a good way to train technicians. The Handan City Handicraft United Cooperative in Hebei Province selected more than 70 workers above the third grade to study in Beijing, Tianjin, and Weifang, Shandong, and the effect was very good. The All-China Handicraft Cooperative Association will also require higher education departments to allocate a part of college graduates to enrich handicraft cooperatives, so that scientific theory and actual production can be combined, learn from each other, and improve together.

Deng Jie talked about the standards for mechanization of handicrafts. He said that currently, only the "special county standard" can be advocated, because the main task of handicrafts is to support the leap forward in agricultural production and promote the development of local industries, and these two tasks are mainly in special zones and counties. Therefore, handicrafts must adapt to the needs of special zones and counties when producing products needed for agriculture and local industries. The so-called "special county standard" includes the following six principles: First, do everything possible to be diligent and thrifty; Second, inexpensive and beautiful, simple and crude; Third, solid and durable, easy to use; Fourth, close cooperation, economical planning; Fifth, easy to repair and maintain, safe operation; Sixth, comprehensive utilization, all-purpose first; On this basis, gradually develop towards modernization standards.

Regarding the future development direction of handicraft cooperatives, Deng Jie said that the current production relations and productive forces of handicraft cooperatives in our country are basically adapted, but under the requirements of our country's accelerated advance to catch up with or surpass Britain in industry and the high-speed development of local industries, if handicraft cooperatives still remain in their original organizational form, it will hinder the further rapid development of productive forces. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually develop handicraft cooperatives from low-level forms to high-level forms. That is, individual handicraft cooperatives with a high degree of modernization can directly develop into local state-owned factories under the premise of national need and the voluntary participation of members. Most cooperatives in the manufacturing industry can develop into cooperative factories operated by county and city handicraft united cooperatives when conditions are ripe, combined with the needs of local industrial renovation and expansion. In addition, some cooperatives can retain their original collective ownership for a long time. Doing so can closely combine handicraft cooperative organizations with local state-owned industries, conduct unified planning and arrangements in production arrangement, economic reorganization, technological transformation, capital construction, and labor force allocation, strengthen the coordination and cooperation of large, medium, and small-scale industries, and accelerate socialist industrialization. This is not only beneficial to the country, but also in line with the wishes of the majority of handicraft cooperative members.

Deng Jie then focused on the issue of cooperative factories. He said that the transformation of handicraft cooperatives into cooperative factories operated by county and city handicraft united cooperatives marks a new stage in the development of the handicraft cooperation movement in our country. These factories have abolished the labor dividends of the members and have all been changed to a wage system; the original public accumulation of the cooperatives has all been transferred to the united cooperative. Cooperative factories after the transformation can organize trade unions. Except for individual members who do not meet the conditions, they can generally join the trade union as members to strengthen the class education of the workers in the cooperative factory. The original cooperative implemented a members' congress system, and after the transformation, it can be changed to a workers' congress system. The cooperative's board of directors can be reorganized and expanded into a factory management committee, etc. In this way, the factors and proportion of ownership by the whole people are expanded and strengthened in the collectively owned economy, and a big step is taken towards ownership by the whole people. This is not only of great political significance to the socialist transformation of handicrafts, but also has an economic role that cannot be ignored in accelerating socialist industrialization.

Deng Jie finally said that because this is a new job, many major policy issues still need to be explored in future work and gradually resolved.

    手工业要进行技术革命
    手工业合作总社负责人说：大部分手工业应向半机械化机械化发展
    据新华社23日讯　在全国工农业生产大跃进的高潮中，手工业生产上也出现了许多新的问题。最近新华社记者就手工业的技术革命和手工业合作运动今后的发展方向问题访问了中华全国手工业合作总社副主任邓洁，请他就这两个问题发表意见。
    邓洁首先谈到手工业的技术革命问题。他说，当前各地手工业普遍存在着一个突出的矛盾，就是手工业生产方式落后，技术水平很低，不能适应农业生产大跃进和地方工业发展的要求。据统计，全国手工业合作社目前只有四、五万台机器设备，按单位计算，机械化程度只到3 ％左右；劳动生产率很低，一般国营现代化大工业每个工人每年平均产值约二万元到三万元；机械化的合作社每人每年一万元到一万五千元；半机械化的合作社五千元到八千元；而一般百人以下的合作社每人每年产值只有二千到三千元。因此必须在手工业系统内广泛地开展一个群众性的技术革命运动，大力改进工具设备，提高技术水平，加速向半机械化、机械化的方向发展。
    邓洁说，关于手工业是否应该实行半机械化、机械化问题，过去是有过争论的。现在看来，全国约有70％左右的手工业经过技术改造，可以向半机械化、机械化方向发展；还有30％如工艺美术制品和为人民生活服务的手工业，除某些生产工具和个别工序可进行技术革新外，手工操作的生产方式，将会长期保存下来。因此，大部分手工业经过技术革命，发展成为机械化工业，一部分手工业仍旧保存下来，这就是机械化、半机械化、手工业之间矛盾的统一。 
    关于手工业技术革命的步骤和技术力量的培养问题，邓洁说，手工业技术革命的步骤，从一个合作社来说，要从减轻繁重的体力劳动着眼，从生产工序中最薄弱的环节做起，使技术改造能同社员的切身要求结合起来，成为群众性的运动。从全国来说，要以大中城市的机、电、铁、木等重点行业带头，在条件许可的情况下，首先把这些行业的合作社武装起来，使他们能够制造专区、县以下手工业合作社和地方中小型工业所需要的各种机床和电机设备，这样既可以解决手工业合作社本身的技术改造问题，又可以补助国营大工业机器设备生产的不足，满足县、乡、社办地方工业的需要。因此，目前急需加强这些重点合作社的技术设备力量，使“母鸡能够生下蛋来”。
    邓洁说，手工业合作社技术力量不足是在进行技术革命过程中的一个重要问题，各地要采取自力更生的办法，不要存在依赖思想。主要采用师傅带徒弟的办法，辅以必要的课堂讲授，大量培养青年徒工。各省市手工业干部学校可以同工业厅协作训练一部分技术人员，也可以委托有条件的学校代训一部分技术人员，或者同大专院校的勤工俭学结合起来。派人留学，也是培训技术工人的好办法，河北省邯郸市手工业联合社抽调了七十多名三级以上工人到北京、天津、山东潍坊去留学，效果很好。全国手工业合作总社还将要求高等教育部门分配一部分大专毕业生充实手工业合作社，使科学理论与实际生产相结合，互相学习，共同提高。
    邓洁谈到手工业机械化的标准问题。他说，目前只能提倡“专县标准”，因为手工业的主要任务是支援农业生产大跃进和促进地方工业的发展，而这两项任务主要在专区和县。因此手工业在生产农业和地方工业所需的产品时，必须适应专区和县的需要。所谓“专县标准”括包以下六个原则：一、千方百计，不离勤俭；二、价廉物美、因陋就简；三、结实耐用、使用轻便；四、密切协作、经济打算；五、修配容易、运转安全；六、综合利用、万能当先；在这个基础上再逐步向现代化标准发展。
    关于手工业合作社今后的发展方向问题，邓洁说，目前我国手工业合作社的生产关系和生产力基本上是适应的，但是在我国工业加速提前赶上或超过英国，在高速度地发展地方工业的要求下，手工业合作社如果仍然停留在原有的组织形式上就会阻碍生产力更进一步地迅速发展，因此必须逐步使手工业合作社由低级形式向高级形式发展。这就是个别现代化程度较高的手工业合作社，可以在国家需要和社员自愿的前提下，直接发展成为地方国营工厂。大部分制造性行业的合作社可以结合地方工业改建和扩建的需要，在条件成熟的时候发展成为县、市手工业联合社经营的合作工厂。另外还有一部分合作社可以在较长时期内保留原来的合作社集体所有制。这样做就能使手工业合作组织和地方国营工业密切结合起来，在生产安排、经济改组、技术改造、基本建设和劳动力调配等方面进行统一规划和安排，加强大中小型工业的配合和协作，加速社会主义工业化。这不仅对国家有利，而且也是符合广大手工业社员的愿望的。
    邓洁接着着重谈到合作工厂问题。他说，手工业合作社转为县、市手工业联合社经营的合作工厂，是标志着我国手工业合作化运动发展到了一个新的阶段。这些工厂取消了社员的劳动分红，全部改为工资制；原来合作社的公共积累全部转为联社所有。转厂以后的合作工厂可以组织工会，除个别不合条件的社员以外，一般都可以参加工会为会员，以加强对合作工厂工人的阶级教育。原来合作社实行社员大会制，转厂以后可以改变为职工大会制，合作社的理事会可以改组扩大为工厂管理委员会等等……。这样，就在集体所有制的经济中扩大和加强了全民所有制的因素和比重，向全民所有制迈进了一大步。这不仅对手工业社会主义改造有重要的政治意义，而且对加速社会主义工业化也有不可忽视的经济作用。
  邓洁最后说，由于这是一件新的工作，许多重大的政策性问题还有待于在今后工作中摸索经验逐步解决。
