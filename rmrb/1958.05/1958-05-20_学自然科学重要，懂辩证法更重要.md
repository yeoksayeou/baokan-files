　　It is important to learn natural science, but more important to understand dialectics
　　Zhou Jianren
    In ancient times, when people saw some unusual forms of creatures, they often added some explanations. But they did not understand science and often resorted to superstition. For example, the nodes of bamboo are generally flat. However, some small bamboos in Zhejiang have nodes near the soil that are not flat but oblique (the upper part is still flat). The old folks in the old society connected it with superstitious stories and turned it into a wrong explanation. They said: Once upon a time, there was a person (later called the Annoyance Ancestor) who, seeing through the world, became a monk. His sister-in-law sent him rice, with bamboo shoots as dishes. The Annoyance Ancestor did not eat it and poured it on the ground behind the house. Later, these dishes grew into bamboo, so the lower nodes of the bamboo are not flat but oblique, like a "chopped knife block". Because Zhejiang bamboo and wild rice stems, etc., generally have a certain cutting method, not straight cutting or transverse cutting, but a knife-by-knife oblique cut into blocks, the blocks are slightly diamond-shaped, called "chopped knife blocks."
    There is also a kind of snail, smaller than ordinary edible snails, with a flat tail end (actually the top of the shell), which looks like it has been cut off. When you pick it up, it is not only flat but also slightly concave, with a small protrusion in the middle. This kind of snail can be found in the streams of Hupao (place name) in Hangzhou.
    Ordinary snails are usually used for wine dishes or meals. When cooking, a little of the tail (that is, the top) is cut off, so that the meat inside the shell can be easily sucked out with the mouth. If a little is not cut off, it cannot be sucked out. The above-mentioned kind of snail looks very much like the "tail" has been cut off, so it is again attached to superstitious stories, saying that a little monk used to eat snails and later fell into the stream and came back to life, thus becoming the current shape. In fact, it is just another kind of snail. According to zoologists, it belongs to a kind of Semisulcospira. It can be seen that it is very important for everyone to learn some scientific knowledge. If you have some scientific knowledge, you will know at a glance that these creatures are a kind of plant or animal and will not attach them to superstition.
    But speaking of this, it is only half of the matter. It is not enough to only have scientific knowledge. For example, the British Wallace, who studied the organisms of the Malay Archipelago and wrote some books, was very good at biology. There was also Crookes, also British, who discovered the chemical element thallium and invented the optical rotator, etc., and also achieved results in scientific research. However, when they encountered vulgar quacks who said that they could summon gods through spiritual mediums, they were fascinated. They believed it to be true. Engels, however, knew at a glance that it was a trick!
    Engels discussed this issue in his famous article "Natural Science in the Spirit World." The conclusion was that the reason why these natural scientists fell into such errors was because they did not understand theory, especially the principles of dialectics. He said:
    "Indeed, contempt for dialectics cannot but be punished. No matter how little one thinks of all theoretical thinking, without theoretical thinking, one cannot even connect two natural facts, or one cannot understand the connection that exists between the two..." "Therefore, empiricism is punished for despising dialectics in this way: even some of the most sober empiricists fall into the most absurd superstition, into modern spiritualism." (Dialectics of Nature, pp. 37-38, People's Publishing House.)
    Chinese intellectuals from the old society show a serious tendency to despise theory. They feel lazy about theoretical thinking and cling to the old way of thinking and refuse to give it up. If you want to break away from the old way of thinking and become a clear-headed person, you need to carry out ideological exercise or transformation - you must strive to learn dialectics and dialectical materialism, and it is completely impossible to look down on it!

　　学自然科学重要，懂辩证法更重要
　　周建人
    古人看到一些形态不寻常的生物，常常加上一些解释。但他们不懂科学，往往求助于迷信。举例说来，竹的节一般都是平的。但浙江有些小形的竹，近土处的节子不是平的，却是斜形（上部的仍然是平的）。旧社会的老百姓就把它与迷信故事连接起来，变成错误的解说。他们说：从前有一个人（后称懊恼祖师），因看破红尘，出家修行。他的嫂嫂给他送饭去，以竹笋作饭菜。懊恼祖师不吃，把它倒在屋后的地上了。后来这些饭菜就长成竹，故竹的下截节子不是平的，而是斜的，像缠刀块的样子。因为浙江竹与茭白等，一般有一定切法，不直切或横断，却一刀刀地斜切成块，其块略呈菱形，叫做“缠刀块”。
    还有一种螺蛳，比普通供食用的螺蛳小些，尾端（其实是壳顶）平坦，很像被截去了的样子。拿起来看时，不仅平坦，而且稍微凹入，中间有一小突起。这种螺蛳在杭州虎跑（地名）的溪水中就有的。
    普通的螺蛳普通作酒菜或饭菜，烧煮时把它的尾（即顶）截去少许，这样，才容易把壳内的肉用口吮出来。如果不截去少许是吮不出的，上述的一种螺蛳因为很像“尾部”被截去的样子，因此又和迷信故事附和在一起，说以前有小和尚吃螺蛳，后来倒在溪中，又活了，遂成现在的形状。其实它不过是螺蛳的另一种。据动物学者说，属于短沟蜷属的一种。可见大家学一点科学知识很重要，如有一些科学知识，对于这等生物，一看就知道是一种植物或动物，不会附会到迷信上去了。
    但说到这里，还只是事情的一半。仅有科学知识还是不够的。例如英国的华莱士，他研究过马莱群岛的生物，著过一些书，在生物学上的造就上是很不错的。还有克鲁克，也是英国人，他发见过化学原素铊，又发明过光旋器等等，在科学研究上也有成绩的。然而他们遇到庸俗的江湖术士，说通过神媒能够降神，便被迷住了。信以为真。恩格斯却一看便知道那是骗术！
    恩格斯在“精神世界里的自然科学”这篇有名的文章里便曾讨论到这个问题，结论是说这些自然科学家之所以会陷入这样的错误，是由于不懂理论，特别是辩证法的道理的缘故。他说：
    “的确，蔑视辩证法是不能不受惩罚的。无论对一切理论的思维多么轻视，可是没有理论的思维，就会连二件自然的事实也联系不起来，或者就会连二者之间所存在的联系都无法了解……”“所以，经验论轻视辩证法便受到这样的惩罚：连某些最清醒的经验论者也陷入最荒唐的迷信中，陷入现代唯灵论中去了。”（自然辩证法，37—38页人民出版社。）
    中国从旧社会来的知识分子，显有严重的轻视理论的倾向。对于理论的思考感到懈闷，执着老一套的思想方法不肯放弃。如果要从旧的思想方法里脱离出来，成为一个头脑清醒的人，是需要加以思想锻炼或改造的——必须努力学习辩证法和辩证唯物主义，看轻完全不行！
