New Farmers' New Style
—On Wang Baojing, Director of the Liquan Fenghuo Cooperative, Learning Science and Innovating Technology
By Our Correspondents Wu Gang and Liu Bin

In the era of Mao Zedong, a new style of farmers is growing. These new-type farmers do not blindly believe in outdated and old agricultural farming routines. They can humbly learn and dare to apply new agricultural scientific technologies to production. In boldly innovating agricultural technology, they dare to fight against some conservative ideas, are unyielding, unafraid of setbacks, and keep going until they achieve results. With vivid facts, they have educated the surrounding farmers, forming a mass movement of learning science and technology and improving farming systems. Wang Baojing, a twenty-seven-year-old youth and director of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, is one of these people.

"If there are difficulties, find ways to solve
them. Only then can people be attracted; steady and slow, what's the point of a leap forward!"

This spring, Wang Baojing proposed to conduct an experiment to produce 5,500 jin per mu. At the time, some said that this would be difficult and advised him to be more stable and take it slow. Wang Baojing thought, "If there are difficulties, find ways to solve them. Only then can people be attracted; steady and slow, what's the point of a leap forward!" Of course, he had a clear idea in mind; this plan was not a madman's fantasy. News reports about the implementation of intercropping, deep plowing, etc., to increase production by several thousand jin inspired him. He carefully calculated the number of plants for intercropping corn, sweet potatoes, potatoes, beans, and spring wheat. Calculated with potatoes converted to grain, reaching this figure would only be more, not less. Most of the cooperative members, young people, and technical staff supported him. He immediately ran to the Northwest Agricultural College to consult professors, researched specific measures, and started working immediately: he plowed one mu of land one and a half chi deep, applied thirty large carts of manure, and selected high-quality corn and sweet potato seeds…

Wang Baojing has always been like this: as long as he hears about any new agricultural scientific farming technology, any production-increasing trick, he seriously thinks about it, immediately experiments, and once there are results, he promotes it universally.

Long before, when Xingping County labor model Zhang Mingliang issued a challenge to produce 1,020 jin of corn per mu, Wang Baojing, at the Liquan County mutual aid team leader and labor model meeting, proposed a counter-challenge of 1,200 jin per mu. At that time, as he spoke, some people grinned; before he finished speaking, dry tobacco pipes were knocking on the table loudly. As soon as he entered the village, people called him "Twelve Hundred" or "Crazy Wang," and even made up a jingle saying, "Wang Baojing is a fool, blowing his horn to overturn the train."

These sarcasms caused by suspicion were not without reason. Many people dared not even think about things they had never done before. Since the time of their ancestors in Xin Zhuang Village, Bailing Palace, corn generally yielded only about 300 jin per mu. Old Man Wang Jinshou's irrigated land had once yielded 600 jin, but everyone attributed the reason to accidental luck. However, Wang Baojing's proposal to produce 1,200 jin was not without basis. It was just that he and others had different ideas about the same thing. He thought, Wang Jinshou can produce 600 jin, why can't we produce even more? County cadres and technical extension station cadres helped him calculate the number of dense plants per mu, researched measures such as seed selection, dense planting, changing hard stubble to soft stubble sowing, applying more fertilizer, and applying fertilizer rationally, believing that it was entirely possible to reach this figure. He ignored the cold remarks and still worked with his team members.

Some people's thought formula is: "Cannot do - do not do - cannot be done"; Wang Baojing's formula is: "Can do - do immediately - can be done."

Wang Baojing uses a different thought formula from many farmers to think about problems. Some people's thought formula is: "Cannot do - do not do - cannot be done." Starting from past experience, they believe that things that predecessors could not do cannot be done; because there are difficulties, they do not do them; and because they do not do them, they finally conclude that they cannot be done. Wang Baojing's formula is different: "Can do - do immediately - can be done." He wants to study why it was not done in the past, what difficulties there are; he finds the reasons and difficulties in the process of doing it, and then finds ways to solve them, so he can do it. In the process of experimenting with cotton and wheat double cropping, these two kinds of thinking also went through a sharp struggle.

If a piece of land only yields one crop of wheat a year, can we harvest a crop of wheat and then a crop of cotton to achieve a leap forward? According to Wang Baojing's thinking: the local climate is warm, the frost-free period is long, there is water conservancy, and if there is more fertilizer and better cultivation, it is entirely possible to have two crops a year. When he told everyone this idea, the debate began. Young Wang Zhenji said, "In the past, some people harvested spring wheat and planted cotton, why can't we harvest wheat and then plant cotton?" Some elderly people said that this was impossible and advised them not to think about anything fancy. Wang Baojing said that we can't just say it can't be done, but also figure out why it can't be done. Then, some said that in the past, harvesting spring wheat and planting cotton could not ripen, and planting after harvesting wheat would be even shorter, fearing that even flowers could not bloom; some said, "Autumn is not as good as summer, a good nephew is not as good as a fool (referring to a biological son)," fearing that cotton would not be harvested and would affect the yield of wheat; some said that harvesting summer grain and planting cotton would be so busy that labor and animal power could not be mobilized at all. Wang Baojing said that the time is short, use methods such as selecting early-maturing crops, intercropping, and transplanting with nutrient pots to solve it; fearing that it would affect wheat yield, we will find ways to catch up with water, fertilizer, and cultivation; if labor and animal power are insufficient, we will start working first, and then solve it when it is not enough. After this debate, they found the reasons why wheat and cotton double cropping could not be done in the past, and decided to use three methods for experimentation: cotton and wheat intercropping, nutrient pot seedling transplanting, and direct seeding after wheat harvest.

Like many new attempts in the past, they encountered various difficulties. Some cooperative members adopted an attitude of distrust towards nutrient pot seedling transplanting. They said that cotton cannot be stepped on to death or planted alive, and even gods can't do anything about it, how can it be transplanted on a large scale? Wang Baojing and other cooperative members still insisted on experimenting. They rushed to make nutrient pots for three days and nights. Things also seemed to be deliberately working against Wang Baojing: not a single seedling came out of the nutrient pots made. As a result, the cooperative members angrily called the technique "sawing trees" and called the technical section chief "careless section chief," and no one wanted to make nutrient pots anymore.

Wang Baojing had a different opinion from everyone. He said, "If every arrow hits the tiger's butt, there will be no king in the mountains. In experiments, who can guarantee success? If we fail, we must learn some lessons, and then accept this lesson to succeed." He mobilized everyone to find the reasons for the failure. It turned out that they had misread the ratio of fertilizer in the nutrient pot, changing a few parts per thousand to a few parts per hundred. As a result, there was too much fertilizer, and they did not enter the cellar in time, so the nutrient pots dried out as soon as they were made. Cotton seeds did not germinate because of lack of water; a few that germinated were also burned to death due to too much fertilizer and high temperature. After correcting these mistakes, all the cotton seedlings came out of the nutrient pots made again.

"Why can university professors do it, but farmers can't learn?"

Wang Baojing has such characteristics, as long as he is inspired by some new agricultural technologies, he boldly thinks hard; if he comes up with some reasoning, he bites it firmly and does not let go, breaking the casserole and asking to the end. After the promotion of the Bima No. 1 improved variety, wheat production increased by more than 20%. This incident made Wang Baojing see the role of cultivating improved varieties in increasing production. But his thinking did not stop there; he further understood how this improved variety was cultivated. Someone told him that it was cultivated by university professor Zhao Hongzhang using sexual hybridization; and sexual hybridization is a very complicated thing, and even some university professors can't do it. They said it in a very mysterious way, as if science is a mysterious and unattainable thing. Wang Baojing didn't think so; since it is all done by people, why can university professors do it, and farmers, who are also people, can't learn it? He went to the Northwest Agricultural College to consult, and after he went, he became even more determined in his belief. It turned out that the actual operators of the agricultural college were also ordinary farmers under the guidance of professors. He consulted professors and technicians, and he would do it as soon as he experimented when he went back.

Once, Wang Baojing consulted a professor and asked how Professor Zhao Jimin cultivated the Wusi No. 4 wheat improved variety. That professor told him that it was cultivated by asexual hybridization. However, the professor said that whether asexual hybridization can cultivate improved varieties is still debated in science, and there is no final conclusion. Wusi No. 4 may be naturally hybridized. Wang Baojing thought that no matter whether it is debated in science or not, there was no such variety in the world in the past, and now there is. He asked in detail about the technology of asexual hybridization, and went back and used the Jin Huanghou and Jipi Bai varieties for experiments, and indeed grew a new variety.

From that conversation, he first learned that natural hybridization can also grow new varieties. Then he thought of many problems: he thought that the Tiehou cotton and Heping cotton discovered by Jingyang farmers were originally selected and bred, and were improved varieties of natural hybridization; he thought that the Bima No. 1 now has a degradation phenomenon, but new varieties are cultivated very slowly and cannot keep up with production needs; he thought that the Siliang No. 4 cotton seed cultivated by the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Comprehensive Experimental Station was only promoted to sixty mu in four years, but the Tiehou cotton selected and bred by Jingyang farmer Meng Wenxi was promoted to more than 3,000 mu in eight years. Therefore, he concluded: we cannot rely solely on the state. If 600 million farmers across the country pay attention to selecting and breeding improved varieties, it can solve a big problem. According to the method of Northwest Agricultural College, he divided two mu of land, one mu as a comparative test of different cultivation methods, and in the other mu, he sowed 112 kinds of wheat varieties for artificial and natural hybridization experiments.

Wang Baojing and his cooperative members have done this for more than three years, and the dissenting opinions of a few people have also been clamoring for more than three years. Some people said that this is not the direction of the agricultural cooperative, but Wang Baojing thought, whether it is a black cat or a white cat, a cat that catches mice is a good cat, as long as it can increase production, why can't it be done. Facts have proved that their doing so has played a great role in increasing production year after year. They have universally promoted improved varieties of various crops on large areas of land; they have cultivated promising wheat improved varieties in small experimental fields, and have also prepared improved varieties for the cooperative that can be promoted on a large scale. Their entire cooperative has 25 cooperative members, including some young girls, who have mastered the technology of sexual and asexual hybridization. Within three years, they used hybridization methods to concentrate the advantages of Liaodong Bai and Hongxin Mayazi two corn improved varieties, cultivated improved varieties suitable for local planting, and universally promoted them on two-thirds of the corn planting land in the entire cooperative, increasing production by 20%.

Wang Baojing and some cooperative members encountered unexpected obstacles of various backward ideas and old concepts in boldly reforming agricultural cultivation technology, and were subjected to countless sarcasms. They broke through numerous obstacles, implemented various scientific agricultural cultivation technology reforms, used the fact that the yield of corn and wheat in the entire cooperative doubled in five years to eliminate various superstitions such as "eight dou of wheat, a wall," liberated everyone's thinking, and made all cooperative members realize that as long as they learn science and technology, dare to think, and dare to do, the production potential of the land is infinite.

Note: Local proverb: "Eight dou of wheat, a wall," that is, one mu of land, the highest yield is eight dou of wheat, 30 jin per dou, a total of more than 240 jin, which is a wall that cannot be crossed.

    新农民的新风格
    ——记醴泉烽火社主任王保京学习科学革新技术的经过
    本报记者　吴钢　刘斌
    在毛泽东的时代里，一些具有新风格的农民正在成长着。这些新型的农民，他们不迷信那些过时的陈旧的农业耕作老规程，能够虚心学习并敢于把一些新的农业科学技术运用到生产上。他们在大胆革新农业技术中，敢于和一些因循守旧的思想作斗争，不屈不挠，不怕挫折，一直干下去，直到干出成绩为止。他们以活生生的事实，教育了周围的农民，形成了一个群众性的学习科学技术、改进耕作制度的运动。二十七岁的青年、陕西省醴泉县烽火农业社主任王保京，就是这种人里的一个。
    “有困难，想办法去解决
  它，才能把人吸住；稳稳当当，慢慢腾腾，还叫什么跃进！”
    今年春天，王保京提出要作亩产五千五百斤的试验。当时，有的说这么作，困难大，劝他还是稳当些，慢慢来。王保京心里想：“有困难，想办法去解决它，才能把人吸住；稳稳当当，慢慢腾腾，还叫什么跃进呢。”当然，他心中有数，这个计划并不是疯子的狂想。报纸上介绍的实行套种、深翻地等等增产数千斤的消息，启发了他。他仔细的计算过实行玉米、红薯、马铃薯、豆类和春麦套种的株数，以薯类折合粮食计算，达到这个数字，是只会多不会少的。社内大部分社员、青年人、技术股干部都支持他。他立即跑到西北农学院向教授们请教，研究出具体措施，马上干起来：把一亩地翻了一尺五深，上了三十大车粪，选下优良的玉米、红薯种子……。
    王保京一直就是这样：只要他听到任何新的农业科学耕作技术、任何增产窍门，就认真的思考，马上去试验，一旦有了结果，就普遍推广。
    还在很早以前，兴平县劳动模范张明亮提出亩产玉米一千零二十斤的挑战时，王保京在醴泉县互助组长、劳动模范会上，提出了亩产一千二百斤的应战条件。那时，他一边讲，一边就有人咧着嘴笑；不等他的话落音，旱烟锅子就敲得桌子光光地直响。他一进村，人们就叫他“一千二”、“王疯子”，还编出顺口溜说：“王保京这娃是二杆，吹牛皮要把火车掀。”
    这些因怀疑而引起的讽刺，不是没有理由的。不少的人对于过去没有作过的事，都连想也不敢去想。白灵宫新庄村祖辈子以来，玉米一般亩产也就是三百来斤。王金寿老汉的水浇地曾经收过六百斤，可是大家都把原因归之于偶然的运气。可是，王保京提出亩产一千二，也不是没有根据的。只不过是对于同样的事，他和别人的想法不同罢了。以他想：王金寿能打六百斤，我们为什么不能再高些呢？县上的干部和技术推广站的干部，帮助他计算了一亩的密植株数，研究了选种、密植、改硬茬为软茬播种、多施肥和合理施肥等措施，认为完全有可能达到这个数字。他不理睬那些冷言风语，仍旧和组员们干自己的。
    有些人的思想公式是：“不能办——不去办——办不到”；王保京的公式是：“能够办——马上办——办得到”。
    王保京就是这样，用着与许多农民不同的思想公式，来思考问题的。有些人的思想公式是：“不能办——不去办——办不到”。他们从过去的经验出发，认为前人办不到的事就不能办；因为有困难也就不去办；也因为不去办，最后还是得出办不到的结论。王保京却是另一种公式：“能够办——马上办——办得到”。他要研究过去为什么没有办成，有什么困难；他在办的中间找出原因和困难，再想办法解决它，因此就能办成。在试验棉麦两熟的过程中，这两种思想也同样进行过尖锐的斗争。
    一块地里，一年只收一料麦子，要跃进，能不能收一料麦子再收一料棉花呢？照王保京想：当地气候暖，无霜期长，有水利，肥料再多些，耕作好些，一年两熟完全有可能办到。当他把这个想法告诉大家时，争论就开始了。青年王振基说：“过去有人收了春麦种棉花，为什么我们不能收了小麦再种棉花呢。”一些老年人却说这根本办不到，劝他们不要想什么五花六花的。王保京说，不能光说办不到，还要闹清为啥办不到。接着，有的说过去收了春麦种棉花还熟不了，收了小麦再种，时间更短，怕连花也不能开；有的说“三秋不如一夏，好侄儿不如傻娃（指亲生）”，怕棉花收不上还影响了小麦的产量；有的讲：收夏时种棉花，劳畜力忙的根本调不开。王保京说时间短，用选早熟作物、间作套种等办法来解决；怕影响小麦产量，就想办法叫水、肥、耕作赶上去；劳畜力不够，先作起来，到不够的时候再解决它。经过这场辩论，他们找到了过去麦棉两熟办不到的原因，决定用棉麦套种、营养钵育苗移栽和麦收后直播三种办法，来进行试验。
    像过去许多新的尝试一样，他们碰到了种种困难。有些社员对营养钵育苗移栽采取了不信任的态度。他们说棉花是踏不死，栽不活，连神仙也没办法的东西，怎么能大量移栽呢。王保京和另一些社员还是坚持着要试验。他们突击了三昼夜来压制营养钵。事情也好像专门和王保京故意作对一样：作出的营养钵，连一个苗子都没有出来。于是，社员们气愤的把技术叫做“锯树”，把技术股长喊成“马虎股长”，谁也不想再作营养钵了。
    王保京和大家的见解不同，他说：“要是箭箭射到老虎尻子，山里就没王了。试验，谁还能保证一下成功呢？失败了得些教训，再接受这个教训，才能成功。”他发动大家找出失败的原因。原来是看错了营养钵肥料配合的比例，把千分之几弄成百分之几。结果肥料过多，加上没有及时入窖，营养钵作好就风干了。棉籽因为缺少水分，没有出苗；少数发芽的，也因肥料多，温度高，给烧死了。纠正了这些错误，再一次作出的营养钵，棉花全部出苗。
    “为什么大学教授能做，农民就无法学会呢？”
    王保京就是具有这样的特征，只要他在一些新的农业技术上受到启发，他就大胆的苦思苦想；如果想出点道理，就一口咬定死不放，打破砂锅润（问）到底。碧蚂一号良种推广后，小麦产量提高20％多。这件事情使王保京看到培育良种对增产的作用。但他的思想没有停留在这一点上；他又进一步了解这个良种是怎么培育出来的。有人告诉他，那是大学教授赵宏章，用有性杂交培育出来的；而有性杂交是非常复杂的事，连有的大学教授还不会搞哩。他们说得玄之又玄，似乎科学是一种神秘奥妙、高不可攀的东西。王保京可不这么想；既然都是人作的，为什么大学教授能做，同样是人，农民就无法学会呢？他到西北农学院去请教，而他去了之后，也就更坚定了他的这种信念。原来农学院实际操作的，也是教授指导下的普通农民。他请教了教授和技术人员，回去一实验就会作了。
    有一次，王保京向一位教授请教，问赵济民教授是怎样培育出五四号小麦良种的。那个教授告诉他是用无性杂交培育的。可是，那位教授说，无性杂交能否培育出良种，现在科学上还有争论，没有定案，五四号可能是天然杂交出来的。王保京心里想，不管它科学上争论不争论，反正世界上过去没有这个品种，现在有了。他详细地问了无性杂交的技术，回去就用金皇后和鸡皮白两种品种作试验，果然长出了一个新品种。
    从那次谈话中，他第一次知道天然杂交还可以长出新品种。接着他想到很多问题：想到泾阳农民发现的铁猴棉、和平棉，原来也都是选育出来的，是天然杂交的良种；想到现在碧蚂一号有退化现象，但新的品种因培育很慢，赶不上生产需要；想到陕西省农业综合试验站培育出的四二号棉种，四年内才推广了六十亩，但是泾阳农民孟文喜选育的铁猴棉，八年就推广了三千多亩。因此，他得出结论：不能单靠国家，如果全国六亿农民都注意选育良种，就能解决大问题。照着西北农学院的方法，他划出二亩地，一亩当做不同耕作方法的对比试验，在另一亩地里，他播种下一百一十二种小麦品种，用来试验人工和天然杂交。
    王保京和他的社员们这样做了三年多，少数人的不同意见也叫嚷了三年多。有人说这不是农业社的方向，但是王保京想，不管黑猫、白猫，捉住老鼠就是好猫，只要能增产，为什么不可以干呢。事实证明了他们这样做，对连年增产起了很大的作用。他们在大面积土地上普遍推广了各种作物的良种；在小块试验田中培育出了有希望的小麦良种，还为社里准备下可以大量推广的良种。他们全社已经有二十五个社员，连一些小姑娘在内，都掌握了有性杂交和无性杂交的技术。三年内，他们用杂交的办法把辽东白和红心马牙两种玉米良种的优点集中起来，培育出适合当地种植的良种，又在全社三分之二的玉米种植土地上普遍推广，增产达20％。
    王保京和一些社员在大胆的进行农业耕作技术改革中，遭到过意想不到的各种落后思想、陈旧观念的重重阻挠，受到过无数的讽刺。他们冲破了重重障碍，实行了各种科学的农业耕作技术改革，以全社五年内玉米、小麦产量翻一翻的事实，破除了“八斗麦，一堵墙”等种种迷信，解放了大家的思想，使全体社员认识到只要学习科学技术，敢想、敢干，土地的增产潜力是无穷无尽的。
    注：当地谚语：“八斗麦，一堵墙”，即一亩土地，最高打八斗小麦，每斗三十斤，共二百四十多斤，这是一堵不可越过的墙。
