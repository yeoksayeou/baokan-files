    The Logic of the Aggressor

    According to an Associated Press report, Willoughby, the former "Intelligence Chief" of the US military invading Korea, recently said in the US Congress that if Japan "turns to neutralism, the US military front in the Pacific will be seriously weakened."

    In Willoughby's view, Japan does not seem to be a country at all, let alone have any territorial sovereignty, but is merely a "military front" of the United States. Since it is a "military front" of the United States, then the United States can, of course, carry out military occupation and control of Japan in all aspects. This logic is indeed very convenient for the American aggressors. However, the misfortune for the likes of Willoughby is that their "intelligence" work is very poor. They seem unaware that more than 90 million people live on Japanese territory, and the Japanese people will never agree to this logic!

    侵略者的逻辑
    据美联社报道，前侵朝美军的“情报首长”威洛贝，最近在美国国会上说，如果日本“转到中立主义方面去，美国在太平洋的军事前线，就会严重地削弱”。
    在威洛贝看来，日本似乎并不是一个什么国家，更谈不到什么领土主权，而只是美国的“军事前线”。既然是美国的“军事前线”，那么美国当然就可以对日本实行军事占领和各方面的控制了。这个逻辑对于美国侵略者说来，的确非常方便。但是，威洛贝之流倒霉的地方就在于，他们的“情报”工作非常糟糕，他们似乎不知道在日本的国土上还居住着九千多万人民，而日本人民是决不能同意这种逻辑的！
