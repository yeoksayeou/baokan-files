Kravchenko and His Prints
	Li Qun

In 1958, the widow of the late Soviet master engraver Kravchenko visited China. In addition to bringing an "Exhibition of Soviet Prints, Posters, Book Illustrations, and Reproductions," she also gifted over a hundred original woodcuts by Kravchenko to the Chinese Artists Association. This act demonstrates her profound friendship towards the Chinese people!

For a long time, the great Chinese writer Lu Xun and Chinese printmakers have been kindred spirits to Kravchenko. As early as 1930, Lu Xun introduced Kravchenko's woodcut "Lenin's Funeral" in his "Selection of New Russian Paintings." Later, in his "Yinyu Collection" compiled in 1934, he introduced Kravchenko's woodcuts "Portrait of Gorky" and "Lenin Library in Moscow." By the time Lu Xun compiled the "Collection of Soviet Prints" in 1936, he had introduced as many as thirteen woodcuts by Kravchenko, including "Dnieper River Construction Site" and "Portrait of Byron," which somewhat satisfied the demands of Chinese enthusiasts. However, compared to the more than one hundred original works now on display at the China Art Gallery, it must be said that this time we are given an even greater feast for the eyes.

In the preface to the "Collection of Soviet Prints," Lu Xun said of Soviet prints: "Unlike French woodcuts, which are mostly delicate and beautiful, nor like German woodcuts, which are mostly bold and unrestrained; yet they are sincere, but not stubborn, beautiful, but not lewd, pleasant, but not frenzied, powerful, but not crude; but they are not static, they make one feel a kind of shock—this shock, just like using solid footsteps, step by step, stepping on the solid and vast black earth towards the road of construction, the footstep sound of the great friendly army." He also said: "Since the October Revolution, the pioneering masters have endured hunger and cold, using a vast mirror and a few knives, unyieldingly pioneering this field of art. ... We can see, is there any one that is not solid, not earnest, or has the intention of being cunning or showing off?"

These general comments, although referring to the works in the entire "Collection of Soviet Prints," are also completely applicable to Kravchenko's woodcuts.

Kravchenko was born on February 12, 1889, in the Saratov Province of the Volga River basin, and died of illness in Moscow on May 31, 1940. Kravchenko grew up in a peasant family. One day, a painter who painted murals for the church in the local village gave young Kravchenko a deep impression, making him fantasize about becoming a painter in the future. Later, he went to Moscow to apply for the Art Middle School and became a student of V. Serov, who was famous throughout Russia at the time. He loved printmaking and showed talent in this art, eventually becoming a world-renowned printmaker.

The era when Kravchenko entered the art world was a time of transition between the old and new in Russian history. The Russian art scene at the time was very complex, with all kinds of formalist schools, as well as the realist Itinerant Art Exhibitions, and there was a sharp struggle between them. After the October Revolution, the art of the young Soviet Republic grew up in an irreconcilable struggle with the formalism inherited from the old bourgeois culture. In 1916, as the great storm of history approached, Kravchenko greeted the October Revolution with great excitement. From the first day of the revolution's victory, he dedicated all his energy to artistic creation and social work.

Kravchenko's woodcuts are mainly book illustrations, and they are all "wood engraving" (engraved using the cross-section of wood). He could carve very finely, even carving stamps with woodcuts. He was a bold innovator in Soviet woodcut and color etching art, able to keenly and deeply observe reality and create moving images.

Kravchenko's woodcuts have obvious creativity. He is good at using black and white and various different knife techniques to create the beautiful decorative flavor of his works.

Hundreds of thousands of literary works illustrated by Kravchenko have been circulated to readers at home and abroad. Kravchenko was very concerned about the important question of whether the people could appreciate his works. When he went to the Baku oil field in 1934, an engineer asked him, "Are you the one who made the illustrations in the familiar works of Pushkin and Gogol?" He was very happy to hear this, because the art that he had ideally envisioned as being appreciated and understood by the masses had finally been realized.

Our country's work of illustrating literary works is not yet developed enough. Printmakers should feel something after seeing this exhibition, and should muster their energy and strive for the top, and open up beautiful flowers in the field of illustration art. (Attached picture)

    克拉甫钦珂和他的版画
    力群
    1958年，已故的苏联著名木刻家克拉甫钦珂的夫人访问了我国，她除带来一个“苏联版画、招贴画、书籍插图、复制画的展览会”外，并以一百余件宝贵的克拉甫钦珂的木刻原作赠送给中国美术家协会。这件事表示了她对于中国人民的多么深厚的情谊！
    中国的伟大文学家鲁迅和中国的版画家们，很久以来就是克拉甫钦珂的知音。鲁迅早在1930年编的“新俄画选”上介绍了克拉甫钦珂的木刻“列宁的葬仪”，之后在他1934年编辑的“引玉集”上又介绍了克拉甫钦珂刻的木“高尔基像”、“莫斯科的列宁图书馆”等作，到1936年鲁迅编选“苏联版画集”时，介绍了克拉甫钦珂的木刻画有十三幅之多，其中有“德聂泊河建筑工地”“拜伦像”等。相当满足了中国爱好者们的要求。但如果和现在展览在中国美术展览馆的一百多幅原作相比较，就不能不说，这次给与我们以更大的眼福。
    鲁迅在“苏联版画集”的序言中谈到苏联的版画时曾说：“它不像法国木刻的多为纤美，也不像德国木刻的多为豪放；然而它真挚，却非固执，美丽，却非淫艳，愉快，却非狂欢，有力，却非粗暴；但又不是静止的，它令人觉得一种震动——这震动，恰如用坚实的步法，一步一步，踏着坚实的广大的黑土进向建设的路的大队友军的足音。”又说：“自十月革命以后，开山的大师就忍饥，斗寒，以一个廓大镜和几把刀，不屈不挠的开拓了这一部门的艺术。……我们可以看见，有那一幅不坚实，不恳切，或者是有取巧，弄乖的意思的呢？”
    这些概括性的评语，虽指的是整个“苏联版画集”中的作品，但也完全适用于克拉甫钦珂的木刻。
    克拉甫钦珂于1889年2月12日生于伏尔加河流域的沙拉夫省，1940年5月31日在莫斯科病逝。克拉甫钦珂在农民的家庭中长大。有一天当地乡村里来了一个为教堂画壁画的画家，给与幼年的克拉甫钦珂以深刻的印象，使他幻想着自己将来也成为一位画家。后来到莫斯科投考美术中学，做了当时声满全俄的弗·赛洛夫的学生。他热爱版画，并在这一艺术上显示了才能，终于成为世界著名的版画家。
    克拉甫钦珂走上美术界的时代，正是俄罗斯的新旧历史交替的时代，当时的俄国美术，情况十分复杂，有形形色色的形式主义画派，也有现实主义的巡回展览画派，这之间有着尖锐的斗争。十月革命后年轻的苏维埃共和国的美术，正是和旧的资产阶级的文化遗留下来的形式主义进行不调和的斗争中成长起来的。1916年，在历史的大风暴来临时，克拉甫钦珂怀着万分兴奋的心情迎接了十月革命，从革命胜利的第一天起，他就把自己的全部精力献给艺术创作和社会工作。
    克拉甫钦珂的木刻，主要是书籍插图，而且都是“木口木刻”（用木头的横断面刻制）。他能刻的非常精细，甚至用木刻刻邮票。他是苏维埃木刻画和彩色腐蚀版画艺术的大胆的革新家，他能锐敏地深刻地观察现实，创造出动人的形象。
    克拉甫钦珂的木刻作品，有着显明的创造性，他善于运用黑白和各种不同的刀法构成作品的美丽的装饰风味。
    成千上万的有克拉甫钦珂的插图的文学著作流传到国内外读者手中，克拉甫钦珂对于人民是否能够欣赏他的作品这一重要问题非常关怀。当1934年他到巴库油矿时，有一位工程师问他，“大家所熟悉的普希金与果戈里作品中的插图就是你作的吗？”他听到这句话，非常高兴，因为他理想过的为群众所能欣赏和理解的艺术终于实现了。
    我们中国目前给文学作品作插图的工作还不够发达，木刻家们看了这个画展应有所感，应鼓足干劲，力争上游，在这一插图的艺术领域内开出美丽的花朵。（附图片）
