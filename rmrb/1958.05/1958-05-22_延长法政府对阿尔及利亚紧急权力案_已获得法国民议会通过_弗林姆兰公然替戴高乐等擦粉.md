Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 21st: The French National Assembly passed a bill on the evening of May 20th, by a vote of 475 to 100, to extend the government's emergency powers in Algeria. This bill was originally passed in March 1956 with the aim of granting the government extraordinary powers to deal with actions against the French government in Algeria. Since then, each new government has been required to extend these powers within ten days of taking office, subject to parliamentary approval.

Voting against the bill were the Poujadist members, members of the Social Republican Party (de Gaulle's faction), and some right-wing "Independent Party" members hostile to the Pflimlin government.

The French Communist Party members, who have consistently voted against this bill for several years, voted in favor this time. Duclos, chairman of the Communist parliamentary group, announced before the vote that the Communist members were voting in favor as a demonstration against de Gaulle and in support of the Republic. Duclos once again exposed de Gaulle as a dictator and accused some in parliament of attempting to overthrow the legitimate government and pave the way for de Gaulle.

Prime Minister Pflimlin made two speeches when submitting the aforementioned bill to the National Assembly for approval. He reiterated that the French ruling clique had no intention of abandoning its colonial position in Algeria.

When talking about the situation in Algeria, Pflimlin deliberately tried to excuse the leaders of the fascist riots there. He said that the situation there remained "ambiguous" and that it was "too early to make a final judgment" on the actions of those involved in the fascist riots. Although Salan, the commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria, had repeatedly publicly stated that he was on the side of the fascist rioters and actively supported de Gaulle, Pflimlin repeatedly emphasized in his speech Salan's "loyalty" to the Republic, saying that Salan "is carrying out the government's instructions" and that the government has "complete trust" in Salan.

He even expressed agreement with de Gaulle's criticism of the Republican system at a press conference the day before, believing that "it contains some truth." He stated that in the near future, the government will begin to take measures to "revise" the constitution.

In his speech, Pflimlin said that the French government is currently taking measures to establish "normal relations" with the Algerian authorities in the coming days; he also said that contact with the latter "has never been interrupted."

On the other hand, domestic extreme right-wing forces are still very rampant. Fascist thugs in Toulon attacked the Toulon City Party organization of the French Communist Party, which was in session. Another leader of the Popular Republican Movement, Bidault, published a statement in the right-wing "Crossroads" weekly on the 20th, openly supporting de Gaulle's establishment of a dictatorship and urging him to take action immediately. Former commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria, retired General Raoul Salan, and Air Force General Chassin, former chief of staff of the Central European Headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, jointly issued leaflets on the 20th, calling for the overthrow of the current French government and supporting de Gaulle's rise to power.

    延长法政府对阿尔及利亚紧急权力案
    已获得法国民议会通过
    弗林姆兰公然替戴高乐等擦粉
    据新华社21日讯　巴黎消息：法国国民议会20日晚上以四百七十五票对一百票通过延长政府对阿尔及利亚的紧急权力的法案。这个法案最初是在1956年3月通过的，目的在使政府拥有非常的权力，可以随意处置在阿尔及利亚发生的反对法国政府的行动。从那个时候起，每届新政府在上台后的十天之内需要经议会同意延长这项权力。
    在表决时投反对票的是布热德分子、社会共和党（戴高乐派）议员和某些敌视弗林姆兰政府的右翼“独立党”议员。
    几年来一直投票反对这个法案的法国共产党议员，这次投了赞成票。共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在投票前宣布，共产党议员投赞成票是作为一种反戴高乐的示威和对共和国的支持。杜克洛再一次揭露戴高乐是一个独裁者，并且指责议会里有人企图推翻合法的政府，替戴高乐开路。
    总理弗林姆兰在把上述法案提交给国民议会通过时，作了两次发言。他再一次表示，法国统治集团无意于放弃它在阿尔及利亚的殖民地位。
    在谈到阿尔及利亚局势时，弗林姆兰有意替那里的法西斯暴乱分子首领开脱。他说，那里的局势仍然“暧昧”，要对那些法西斯暴乱参与者的行为作出“最后判断，还嫌过早”。尽管驻阿尔及利亚法军总司令萨兰已经不止一次公开表明他是站在法西斯暴乱分子一边和积极拥护戴高乐的，但是弗林姆兰在发言中竟一再强调萨兰对共和国的“忠诚”，并且说，萨兰“正在执行政府的指示”，政府对萨兰具有“完全的信任”。
    他甚至对戴高乐前一天在记者招待会上对共和体制所作的抨击表示同意，认为“其中含有某些真理”。他表示，在最近期间，政府就将着手进行“修改”宪法的措施。
    弗林姆兰在发言中说，法国政府目前正在采取措施，以便在今后几天中能够同阿尔及利亚当局建立“正常关系”；他还说，同后者的联系“始终没有中断过”。
    另一方面，国内极右翼势力仍然十分嚣张。土伦的法西斯暴徒袭击了正在开会的法国共产党土伦市党组织。人民共和党的另一个头子皮杜尔20日在右翼“十字路口”周刊上发表声明，公开支持戴高乐建立独裁政权，并且催促他立即采取行动。前阿尔及利亚法军总司令、退伍将军雷蒙·歇里埃尔和曾任北大西洋集团中欧总部参谋长的空军将军夏申在20日联名发布传单，号召推翻法国现政府，拥护戴高乐上台。
