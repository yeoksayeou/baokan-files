Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 6th - The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has designated May as Industrial Production Inspection Month, requiring Party committees at all levels to organize industrial production inspection groups during this month to delve into factories and mines, and workshops to examine the existing problems in current industrial production. The Provincial Party Committee has already formed an industrial production inspection group of 380 people, including directors of departments, bureaus, and offices, who will go to various places for inspection on the 5th and 6th.

The Provincial Party Committee stipulated that in this inspection, all leading cadres in charge of industry, including Party secretaries, commissioners, mayors, as well as responsible comrades from relevant departments such as the Heavy Industry Bureau, Light Industry Bureau, Metallurgical Bureau, Handicraft Industry Bureau, and the trade union, except for those who must stay home, should go down to the grassroots. The first secretaries of Party committees at all levels should also dedicate a certain amount of time to participate in this inspection. For this reason, the Provincial Party Committee has stipulated that no large-scale meetings will be held in May in order to concentrate efforts on doing this work well. The inspection groups in all areas will be under the unified leadership of the Party committees.

Guangdong Province achieved excellent results in industrial production in the first quarter, completing 20.2% of the annual leap forward plan in the first quarter, an increase of 19.9% compared to the same period last year. However, there are still problems such as the uneven completion of the leap forward plan and the emergence of new imbalances. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee believes that all measures must be taken to promptly solve these problems and find the direction of effort so that future industrial production can leap forward faster. Organizing industrial production inspection groups is an important measure to solve these problems.

According to Changjiang Daily: The Urban and Industrial Work Inspection Group dispatched by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party will launch a major inspection of urban and industrial work starting June 1st.

Wang Renzhong and Zhang Pinghua will serve as the chief and deputy chief leaders of the inspection group, respectively. Song Kanfu will serve as the head of the Wuhan subgroup, and Li Erzhong, Han Guanghua, Chen Kedong, and Hu Guangen will serve as the deputy heads of the Wuhan subgroup.

This major inspection will be combined with the Provincial Party Committee's Provincial Urban and Industrial Work Conference to be held in late May. In the early stage of the conference, the provincial local industrial plan and how to further implement the policy of "the whole Party running industry, the whole people running industry" will be discussed, the rectification movement will be summarized, and how to carry out the technical revolution and cultural revolution movements will be discussed; in the mid-stage of the conference, seven subgroups will be dispatched to various cities and special districts throughout the province for inspection, which will take about half a month; during the conference, they will gather in Shashi for inspection, evaluation, and summary.

In addition to the six items stipulated in the Provincial Party Committee's "Decision on Organizing Inspection and Evaluation of the Complete Victory of Enterprise Rectification and Production Leap Forward," the Provincial Party Committee has decided to simultaneously conduct inspections on the Party's leadership over trade union work, the work of the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation.

    全面规划地方工业　切实促进工业跃进
    开展一次工业大检查
    广东省委和湖北省委的作法值得提倡
    新华社广州6日电　中共广东省委确定5月份为工业生产检查月，要求各级党委在这个月里组织工业生产检查团，深入厂矿、车间检查当前工业生产中存在的问题。省委已经组成了有部、厅、局长参加的三百八十人的工业生产检查团，在5、6两日分别前往各地进行检查。
    省委规定，在这次检查中，各级管工业的党委书记、专员、市长以及重工业厅、轻工业厅、冶金局、手工业局、工会等有关部门的领导干部，除了个别必须留家的都要下去。各级党委的第一书记也要拿出一定的时间参加这次检查。为此，省委规定5月份一律不开大会，以便能集中精力做好这一工作。各地的检查团都将由党委统一领导。
    广东省第一季度的工业生产取得了很好的成绩，首季完成年度跃进计划的20.2％，较去年同期增长19.9％。但是还存在着跃进计划完成得不够均衡，出现了新的不平衡等问题。因此省委认为必须采取一切措施及时解决这些问题和找出努力方向，才能使今后的工业生产更快跃进。组织工业生产检查团，就是解决这些问题的重要措施。
    本报讯　据长江日报消息：中共湖北省委派出的城市和工业工作检查团，从6月1日起将展开对城市和工业工作的大检查。
    检查团由王任重、张平化分别担任正副总团长。宋侃夫任武汉分团团长，李尔重、韩光华、陈克东、胡广恩任武汉分团副团长。
    这次大检查将和省委在5月下旬召开的全省城市和工业工作会议结合进行。会议前期将讨论全省地方工业规划和如何进一步贯彻执行
  “全党办工业，全民办工业”的方针，总结整风运动和讨论如何开展技术革命运动和文化革命运动；会议中期将派出七个分团分赴全省各市及专区进行检查，时间大约半个月；会议期间将集中到沙市进行检查、评比、总结。
    除省委“关于企业整风全胜和生产跃进组织检查评比的决定”中规定的六项内容外，省委决定对于党对工会工作的领导、共青团和妇联的工作同时进行检查。
