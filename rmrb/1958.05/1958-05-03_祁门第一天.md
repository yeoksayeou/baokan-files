    First Day in Qimen
    Shí Fāngyǔ
    Leaving behind the Shanghai of bustling traffic and towering buildings, after only a few days and nights of travel, I am presented with a scene of overlapping peaks and clear, bottomless streams. The car speeds along the highway, winding through mountains and ridges, as smoothly as if it were traveling on the asphalt roads of the city. Here, there are no barren mountains, no wasteland. The mountains are covered with dense, lush pine and fir trees, and then suddenly, there are mountains full of tea trees. The tea-picking season is almost upon us; the tea trees are growing luxuriantly, looking like clusters of green velvet balls embroidered on a canvas of clear yellow silk from afar. Qimen black tea – what a delightful beverage it is, both at home and abroad!
    In the fields and valleys, the barley waves in the wind, and the rapeseed grows as tall as a three-year-old child, its flowers as yellow as steamed millet. From Wuhu southward and then west from Tunxi, this oil crop can be seen everywhere. The time for planting rice is approaching, and the spring breeze ripples the water in the newly plowed paddy fields. Piles of fertilizer from the production teams are scattered like small hills. The peasants have put forward the slogan "A thousand loads of fertilizer, a thousand catties of grain!" and the work of accumulating fertilizer last winter was in full swing. All winter long, they worked hard and fast. On the utility poles along the highway, large banners made of wooden planks often proclaim: "Guarantee a yield of 1,400 catties per mu, and strive for 1,500 catties!" This is the production team peasants' letter of determination in the midst of the Great Leap Forward, a figure that far exceeds the county committee's original target of 800 catties. I heard that Qimen County, because of its extensive planting of cash crops, has always relied on outside support for grain, but it is expected that this year's grain production will not only definitely be self-sufficient, but also have a surplus.
    This is my first time in the countryside, and although the things I have encountered are exciting, I can't help but feel a little unfamiliar, as one does when arriving in a strange place. The First Secretary's kind and humorous manner immediately made me feel as if I were visiting an old friend after a long absence, making me feel warm and comfortable. This township recently built a hydroelectric power station in a blitz, spending only a few days and nights. This is the first hydroelectric power station in Qimen County, and within one to two years, the entire county will have hydroelectric power stations in every township, and within three years, it will achieve mechanization and electrification. The county is now purchasing small, versatile tractors from Shanghai and other cities. I recently saw a photo of this type of tractor in the newspaper, and the news said that this tractor can do almost anything, hence the name "versatile," and it is especially suitable for mountain operations. In addition to tractors, they are also buying lathes. The First Secretary's small desk also has a pile of bearings and balls he brought from Hefei, as well as a slide rule.
    Qimen also has abundant mineral resources. Before the car arrived in Qimen, it passed a beautifully constructed, large-scale kaolin factory, whose products are the raw materials for Jingdezhen porcelain. On the First Secretary's desk is also a piece of ore, taken from a crystal mine, which shines brightly in the sunlight. In addition to crystal, the ore also contains a large amount of raw materials for making cement and glass.
    "If we can make cement, we will build a cement factory; if we can make glass, we will build a glass factory!" This is his bold and sonorous voice.
    In addition, there is a mountain with considerable reserves, whether it is copper or gold cannot be said for sure yet, but "whether it is copper or gold, we must let it see the light of day!"
    The county committee's correspondent repeatedly and enthusiastically invited me to visit the hydroelectric power station, which, of course, was something I couldn't wish for more. After seeing the hydroelectric power station, he insisted on taking me to see "that slow rice mill." This is a low, small workshop where a wooden wheel two meters in diameter turns under the impact of the water flow, lifting three hammers hanging on the frame to alternately pound the grain in the water pit sunk in the ground.
    "It takes half a day to pound dozens of catties of rice, which makes people impatient!" He said resentfully, and then his face lit up immediately. "With electricity, they should give way to rice mills!"
    The correspondent looked no more than twenty years old, with a smart look on his face, and he was wearing a military uniform dyed blue. On the way back, he told me enthusiastically about something the First Secretary had temporarily forgotten to mention:
    "We're also going to have a train!" he said seriously.
    It turned out that a railway from Wuhu through Qimen to Yingtan would soon begin construction.
    "If we have a train again, Qimen will be even more extraordinary!" he said loudly.
    I couldn't help but become more excited. I seemed to see a locomotive pulling the entire mountain area forward at a rapid pace. Isn't this our real life: aren't we rushing towards socialism with a leaping and advancing posture, and isn't it our Party that is walking at the forefront of life, leading life to leap forward with the power of a thunderbolt! Qimen, in a few years, I won't be able to say that this is just the countryside! I have come to such a beautiful and promising place!

    祁门第一天
    石方禹
    离开车水马龙高楼如林的上海，仅仅几个昼夜的旅程，呈现在眼前的已是一片峰峦重叠的高山和淙淙汩汩清可鉴底的溪流。汽车穿山过岭地在公路上飞奔着，一路上平稳得就像在市区的柏油马路上行驶一样。这里看不到一座濯濯的童山，看不到一块荒芜的田地。山上是密密层层葱郁茂盛的松树和杉树，转眼前面又出现满山的茶树。采茶的季节立刻就要到了，茶树长得枝叶茂盛，远远望过去，就像一团团绿色的绒球绣在澄黄的绢缎上。祁门红茶，在国内外市场上这是多么惹人欢心的饮料呵！
    田地里、山谷中，大麦迎着风在翻着波浪，油菜长得有三岁小孩那么高，油菜花黄得像蒸粟一样。从芜湖南下，再从屯溪西行，到处可看到这种油料作物。水稻插秧的时候快到了，新翻过的稻田上，春风吹过，积水在荡漾着。生产队的肥料星罗棋布地像小山一样堆积着，农民们提出“千担肥千斤粮”的口号，去冬积肥工作搞得热火朝天，大干特干了一个冬天。在公路两旁的电线杆上常常可以看到用木板制成的大横幅，上面写着：“保证亩产一千四百斤，争取一千五百斤！”这是大跃进声中生产队农民的决心书，这个数字远远地超过县委原定的八百斤的指标。听说祁门县由于经济作物种植得多，一向粮食要依靠外地支援，可是预计今年粮食产量不但肯定地可以自给，而且还会有盈余。
    我是第一次到农村来，虽然已接触到的事物都是令人兴奋的，心里却不免还有一些初到一个陌生地方时的生疏的感觉。第一书记亲切而又带幽默的谈吐，使我立刻产生了到久别的老朋友家串门去的心情，觉得暖洋洋地。这一个乡不久之前，只花了几昼夜的时间就突击建立了一座水力发电站。这是祁门县第一座水力发电站，而在一年到两年以内，全县要做到乡乡有水电站，三年以内要实现机械化电气化。现在县里正向上海以及别的城市购买小型万能拖拉机。不久前我在报纸上看到这种拖拉机的照片，报上的消息说这种拖拉机几乎什么活都能干，所以名叫万能，特别适合于山区操作。除了拖拉机以外还买车床。第一书记的小书桌还放着一堆他从合肥带来的轴承弹子和一支计算尺。
    祁门还有丰富的矿产。汽车到达祁门以前，就在一座建筑漂亮、规模不小的瓷土厂驶过，这里的产品是景德镇瓷器的原料。在第一书记的桌上还有一块矿石，这是从水晶矿里取出来的，在阳光的照射下它射出耀眼的光辉。除了水晶以外，矿石中还含有大量制造水泥和玻璃的原料。
    “能做水泥我们就办水泥厂，能做玻璃，就盖玻璃厂！”这是他的豪迈宏亮的声音。
    此外还有一个蕴藏量不少的矿山，是铜是金现在还不能肯定，不过“不管是铜是金，都要叫它见天日！”
    县委的通讯员一再热情地要带我上水电站看看去，这当然是我求之不得的事。看了水电站，他又坚持带我去看看“那个慢吞吞的辗米坊。”这是一所低矮的小作坊，在水流冲激下，一个直径二公尺长的木轮在转动着，抬起横在架子上的三支槌子轮流地捣着陷在地里的水坑中的谷子。
      “几十斤稻子要捣半天，叫人看了心急！”他恨恨地说罢立刻眉飞色舞起来，“有了电，它们该让位给辗米厂了！”
    通讯员看上去不超过二十岁，满脸伶俐的颜色，他穿着被染成蓝色的军服。在回来的路上他兴致勃勃地告诉我第一书记一时忘了提起的事：
    “还要通火车呢！”他严肃认真地说。
    原来有一条从芜湖经过祁门到鹰潭的铁路不久后就要动工了。
    “要再通火车呀，祁门就更不得了啦！”他大声地说。
    我也不由地更加激动了起来。我似乎看到有一台火车头拉动了整个山区向前飞奔。这难道不是我们真实的生活吗：我们不正是以飞跃前进的姿态向社会主义飞奔，而走在生活的前面以雷霆万钧的力量牵引着生活向前跃进的不正是我们的党！祁门呵，再过几年我就不能再说这仅仅是农村了！我是到了一个多么美好而又前途似锦的地方来呀！
