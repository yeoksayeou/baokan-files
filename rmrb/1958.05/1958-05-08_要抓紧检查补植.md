    It is necessary to seize the time to check and replant.
    Wang Zhentang
    Planting saplings or sowing seeds is only one step in completing afforestation. Planting seedlings and sowing seeds does not mean that the entire afforestation work has been completed, let alone the realization of greening. Whether the newly planted trees have survived? How many have survived? Now it is necessary to seize the time to conduct an inspection and replant in a timely manner. This is an important measure to consolidate the achievements of the previous stage of afforestation.
    According to inspections in Anhui, Hebei, and other provinces, most areas paid attention to quality in this spring's afforestation. However, even in places where quality was emphasized, some seedlings were planted substandard and therefore could not survive. In response to these situations, only timely processing and replanting can ensure that more seedlings survive and grow quickly. Finding and remedying early will save a lot of labor and seedlings compared to reforesting after the seedlings have withered. It is inappropriate for some places not to take action now and plan to wait until autumn to inspect the young forests.
    The main difficulty in carrying out young forest inspections now is that spring plowing and wheat field management are very intensive. This requires a reasonable arrangement of young forest inspections and current major agricultural work. Many areas include greening as an item in the inspection projects of inspection teams, and this kind of coordinated arrangement is worth promoting.
    Spring afforestation has been going on for a long time. Is it a bit late to check and replant now? It is a little late. However, if we can seize the time to conduct an inspection before the end of May, it will still be of great benefit. Because checking and replanting requires less labor than afforestation, and it does not require such a concentrated effort in terms of time. As long as the specific practices are arranged more flexibly (such as checking along the way, mobilizing young people to use their spare time or organizing auxiliary labor to do this work, etc.), it is entirely possible to do it.
    Anhui, Hebei, and other provinces combined inspections with comparisons during afforestation inspections, and this approach is worth promoting. Those who are found to have done well after the inspection should be commended and rewarded, which can promote everyone to learn from the advanced. Those who are found to have done poorly should be urged to step up replanting and processing. On the issue of large-scale afforestation, we should also promote the spirit of promotion, that is: diligently inspect the work done, immediately correct any shortcomings found, and strive to catch up with the advanced!

### 要抓紧检查补植

    要抓紧检查补植
    王振堂
    栽了树苗或者播下树种，仅是完成造林的一个工序。栽苗和播种完了，不等于整个造林工作已经结束，更不等于实现绿化。新栽的树是否活了？活了多少？现在需要抓紧时间进行一次检查，及时补植。这是巩固前一阶段造林成果的一项重要措施。
    根据安徽、河北等省检查，今春造林中绝大部分地区注意了质量。但就是在注意了质量的地方，也有一部分栽植不合规格、因此不能成活的树苗。针对这些情况，只有及时加工补植，才能保证更多的树苗成活并且长得快。发现以后早作补救，比起树苗枯死时再重新造林，要节省很多劳力和苗木。有些地方现在不动手，想等秋季再来检查幼林，这是不妥当的。
    现在开展幼林检查，最主要的困难是春耕及麦田管理等工作非常紧张。这就要求把幼林检查和当前主要农活作合理的安排，不少地区检查团的检查项目中都有绿化一项，这种统筹安排的作法值得提倡。
    春季造林已经开始了好久，现在再来检查、补植，是不是有点晚了？是晚了一点。但是如果能在5月下旬以前，抓紧时间进行一次检查，还是大有好处的。因为检查补植，与造林比起来，所需的劳力不是那么多，在时间上也不要求那么集中。只要在具体做法上安排得机动灵活一些（如顺路检查，发动青年利用空余时间或组织辅助劳力做这工作等等），是完全有可能做到的。
    安徽、河北等省在造林检查中结合进行评比，这种做法值得提倡。经过检查发现做得好的，给予表扬奖励，可以推动大家向先进看齐。发现做得不好的，就督促他们加紧进行补植和加工。在大规模造林的问题上，我们同样应该提倡促进的精神，这就是：做了工作勤检查，发现缺点立即纠正，力争赶上先进！
