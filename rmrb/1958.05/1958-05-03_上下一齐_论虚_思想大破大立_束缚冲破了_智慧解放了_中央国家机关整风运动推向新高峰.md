Xinhua News Agency, 30th: After adopting the method of first "focusing on the abstract" and then "focusing on the concrete" to launch in-depth debates, the rectification movement in central state organs has been pushed to a new climax. The soul of business work has been grasped, the shackles of subjectivism and right-leaning conservative thinking have been broken, and many organs have seen a new situation of communist ideological liberation movement.

From the time the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the directive on the rectification movement last "May 1st" to today, it has been a full year. Great ideological liberation is one of the most significant achievements of the rectification movement over the past year.

Currently, the situation of the movement in the central state organs is precisely at a decisive stage of achieving a complete victory in the rectification. Since the Party Committee of the Central State Organs corrected the shortcomings of focusing on specific matters and specific outlines in the in-depth debate, now the vast majority of organs, with leading cadres taking the lead and politics in command, are "discussing the abstract" together from top to bottom, that is, discussing the "abstract" from the "concrete", using the "abstract" to lead the "concrete", and concentrating their efforts on grasping the big picture. Some organs' party groups have held meetings for days to open their hearts and completely open up their thinking, while mobilizing the masses to launch in-depth debates.

After adopting the method of "discussing the abstract", people's minds have opened up, and all walks of life have seen the entire chain from one link, and discovered that there are still many situations in the labor relations between the part and the whole, the part and the part, and people in the production process that cannot adapt to the development of production. How to adjust these labor relations in accordance with the correct construction line and construction method is precisely the key to unlocking ideological liberation. Many people said after the debate that they had been buried in their work for several years, and today they realized that the fundamental questions of "for whom" and "relying on whom" in business work had not been completely resolved.

Many situations in the debate show that thoroughly liberating the mind and grasping the essential problems in work will greatly help adjust mutual relations in production. The State Planning Commission criticized the dogmatism that was divorced from reality and the tendency to neglect politics in planning work during the debate, and especially criticized the erroneous understanding of the "mechanical equilibrium theory" that contradicted dialectical materialism. They believe that in the past, in planning work, they often saw the phenomena but not the essence, the tributaries but not the mainstream, and the understanding of the balancing method was passive and static, that is, the so-called mechanical and absolute "equilibrium theory". This erroneous understanding shackled people's thinking and prevented them from regulating production according to the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical results.

The First Ministry of Commerce continuously "discussed the abstract" for thirteen days. When they further clarified the relationship between circulation and production and consumption, their thoughts were liberated. In the past, there was a serious tendency in the commercial sector to "see things but not people" and to neglect politics. The concepts of "funds" and "profits" greatly restricted the thinking of cadres in the commercial sector, and "stabilizing market prices" also became a "heavy burden." Therefore, it was difficult when there were too few goods, and it was also difficult when there were too many goods. They were always afraid of imbalance and always struggled. Under the domination of this mechanical equilibrium theory, there has long been a problem of a weak production perspective in commercial work. When the inventory of a certain commodity is too large, the commercial sector always wants to purchase less. The cadres of the Ministry of Commerce believed in the debate that production is fundamental, and the relationship between circulation and production departments must be adjusted in accordance with the socialist construction line. If commercial work weakens the idea of serving production, it will lose its soul, and it will inevitably be "endless worries" and will not gain "freedom" or "liberation."

The communist ideological liberation movement is a profound movement of breaking down and establishing anew ideologically. According to the revealed situations, the main obstacle to ideological liberation at present is the subjectivist tendency of being divorced from reality and the masses. The main manifestations of subjectivism—dogmatism and empiricism—have been deeply criticized in the movement. Many organs revealed that this bad tendency seriously hampered the development of productive forces and hampered the development of the subjective initiative of the people. It is necessary to break the old conventions with a hundred times the courage to liberate the wisdom of the masses. When criticizing dogmatism, the Ministry of Railways revealed that the calculation method of time in the freight regulations once stipulated: "(1) The calculation of hours is based on sixty minutes per hour; (2) The calculation of days is based on twenty-four hours per day; (3) The calculation of months is from the first day of the month to the last day of the month as one month." Although this example is strange, the fact that it can be retained as a regulation shows how dogmatism has rigidified people's thinking. The Ministry of Construction Engineering revealed a shocking report system: According to the statistics of this ministry, for an ordinary building with thirty work numbers undertaken by a work section, 6,000 sub-item project acceptance forms need to be filled out for each settlement, with nearly 500,000 words, requiring nine to ten people to regularly perform this work; according to the construction enterprises under this ministry, an equivalent number of settlement personnel would require 4,000 people. In addition, including the settlement personnel of banks and construction units, it is estimated that a huge team of nearly 10,000 people would be needed to work for this cumbersome acceptance form.

Resolutely breaking the shackles of unreasonable rules and regulations has prompted people to believe in the masses and no longer rely on the "omnipotence" of the system. The Ministry of Finance has more than 1,400 kinds of rules and regulations, and the Ministry of Railways has about 2,000 kinds. Now the two ministries have seized this huge network of systems and launched in-depth debates. The cadres of the Ministry of Finance raised the fundamental question of who should be relied on to manage finance. They sharply criticized some people for being superstitious about the system, ignoring the human factor, and only believing in themselves and not relying on the right-leaning conservative thoughts of the Party and the masses. Now this ministry proposes to establish the mass line and the creative spirit of independent thinking in financial work, and resolutely rely on the whole Party and the masses to manage finance. Only in this way can we achieve a comprehensive liberation in all aspects, such as leadership ideology, system, organizational structure, and working methods.

The rectification movement has been going on for a year. The central state organs are very vigilant about that kind of slack mood and are seizing the opportunity to insist on carrying out the rectification movement to the end. At present, it is particularly emphasized that the upsurge of "discussing the abstract" should be fully and deeply launched from the leadership to the masses, and seizing this link and thoroughly liberating the mind will have immeasurable significance for promoting the leap forward in production and construction.

### 上下一齐“论虚”思想大破大立  束缚冲破了　智慧解放了  中央国家机关整风运动推向新高峰

    上下一齐“论虚”思想大破大立
    束缚冲破了　智慧解放了
    中央国家机关整风运动推向新高峰
    新华社30日讯　采取先“务虚”后“务实”的办法展开深入辩论以后，中央国家机关的整风运动推上了新的高峰，业务工作中的灵魂被抓住了，主观主义和右倾保守思想的束缚被冲破，许多机关出现了共产主义思想解放运动的新局面。
    从去年“五一”中共中央发布整风指示以来，到今天已整整一周年。思想的大解放，是整风运动一年来取得的最重大的成果之一。
    目前运动的形势，在中央国家机关正是处在取得整风彻底胜利的决定性的阶段。自从中央国家机关党委纠正了深入辩论中的就事论事、就纲论纲的缺点以后，现在绝大多数机关都以领导干部带头，以政治为统帅，上下一齐“论虚”，即是从“实”中谈“虚”，以“虚”带“实”，集中力量抱大西瓜。有的机关党组几天来连日开会交心，彻底敞开思想，同时发动群众深入展开辩论。
    采取了“论虚”的办法以后，人们的思想敞开了，各行各业都从一个环节看到了整个链条，发现了生产过程中局部和整体、局部和局部、人和人之间的劳动关系还有许多不能适应生产发展的情况，如何按照正确的建设路线和建设方法来调整这些劳动关系，正是解开了思想解放的窍。许多人在辩论以后说，几年来埋头工作，今天才发现业务工作“为了谁”、“依靠谁”这些根本性的问题并没有彻底解决。
    辩论中许多情况表明，彻底解放思想，抓住工作中的本质问题，将大大有助于生产中相互关系的调整。国家计划委员会在辩论时批判了计划工作中脱离实际的教条主义和忽视政治的倾向，特别批判了同辩证唯物主义相违背的“机械平衡论”的错误认识。他们认为，过去在计划工作中往往看到现象而看不清本质，看到支流而看不清主流，对平衡法的了解是消极的、静止的，就是所谓机械的绝对的“平衡论”。这种错误认识束缚了人们的思想，不能按照多快好省的方针来调剂生产。
    第一商业部连续“论虚”十三天，当他们进一步弄清了流通同生产及消费的关系时，他们的思想自由了，解放了。过去，商业部门存在严重的“只见物不见人”的忽视政治的倾向，“资金”和“利润”的观念对商业部门干部的思想有很大的束缚力，“稳定市场物价”也成为一个“沉重的负担”，因此，东西少了为难，东西多了也为难，总是怕不平衡，总是左右为难。在这种机械平衡论的思想支配下，商业工作上长期以来存在着生产观点不强的毛病，某一项商品库存多了的时候，商业部门总是想少收购一点。商业部的干部在辩论中认为，生产是基本的，必须按照社会主义的建设路线来调整流通同生产部门的关系，商业工作削弱了为生产服务的思想，就失掉了灵魂，就必然是“无穷的忧虑”而得不到“自由”，得不到“解放”。
    共产主义思想解放运动是一个深刻的思想上大破大立的运动。根据揭发的情况表明，当前束缚思想解放的主要障碍是脱离实际脱离群众的主观主义倾向，主观主义的主要表现形式——教条主义和经验主义在运动中受到深刻的批判。许多机关揭发，这种不良的倾向严重地束缚了生产力的发展，束缚了人民群众主观能动性的发挥，必须以百倍的勇气打破坛坛罐罐，才能使群众的智慧解放出来。铁道部在批判教条主义时，揭发了货运规章中关于时间的计算办法竟然曾经作了这样的规定：“（一）时的计算以六十分钟为一时；（二）日的计算以二十四小时为一日；（三）月的计算从月初一日到月末一日为一月。”这个例子虽然稀奇，但是它能够被保留下来成为一条章程，说明教条主义已经怎样僵化了人们的思想。建筑工程部揭发了一件惊人的表报制度：根据这个部统计，一个工段承担三十个工号的普通楼房，每结算一次要填写六千份分项工程验收单，近五十万字，需要九到十人来经常进行这件工作；按照这个部所属的建筑企业计算，旗鼓相当的结算人数就需要四千人，此外加上银行和建设单位的结算人员在内，估计总共就需要近万人的一个庞大队伍去为这个繁琐的验收单效劳。
    坚决打破不合理的规章制度的束缚，促使了人们去相信群众，而不再依赖制度的“万能”。财政部的规章制度有一千四百多种，铁道部约有二千种，现在两个部都抓住这个庞大的制度网群展开了深入的辩论。财政部的干部提出了究竟应该依靠谁办财政的根本性问题，他们尖锐地批判了有些人迷信制度，忽视了人的因素，只相信自己不依靠党和群众的右倾保守思想。现在这个部提出要树立财政工作走群众路线和独立思考的创造精神，坚决依靠全党、依靠群众办财政，只有这样才能从领导思想、体制、组织机构和工作方法等各方面全面来个大解放。
    整风运动已经进行了一年，中央国家机关十分警惕那种松劲情绪，正在抓紧时机坚持把整风运动进行到底。目前特别强调要从领导到群众全面深入地展开“论虚”的热潮，抓紧这个环节，彻底解放思想，对于促进生产建设的跃进将有无可估量的意义。
