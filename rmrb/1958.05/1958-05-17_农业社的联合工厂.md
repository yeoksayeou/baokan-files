　　Joint Factories of Agricultural Cooperatives
    This newspaper reports that the Guoguang and Baoguang Agricultural Cooperatives in Wangqiao Township, Jingyang County, Shaanxi Province, have utilized the waterpower of the Jinghui Canal to establish a comprehensive factory that includes flour milling, cotton ginning, cotton delinting, and cotton batting. The total investment in this factory was 19,000 yuan. From August 1957 to February of this year, it processed 400,000 jin of ginned cotton, milled 1,448,000 jin of wheat, and milled 900,000 jin of corn, with a total output value of 530,000 yuan.
    This factory saves the agricultural cooperatives 2,400 animal labor days and 2,100 human labor days per month. It produces 13,000 jin of flour and 174 jin of delinted cotton daily.
    The advantages of agricultural cooperatives running factories are: First, production and management are simple, and costs are low. The factory director is concurrently the director of the agricultural cooperative, and workers are replaced by agricultural cooperative members, who are only credited with work points and are not paid wages. There are only four apprentices in the factory. Second, there are no supply, sales, or transportation difficulties. Third, the factory adapts to individual circumstances, taking care of the elderly, young, disabled, and weak, and arranging jobs accordingly. Fourth, apprentices are selected from demobilized cadres, students, and veterans from the countryside. These people are educated and can master technology with a little training.

　　农业社的联合工厂
    本报讯　陕西省泾阳县王桥乡国光、宝光两个农业社，利用泾惠渠的水力，办了一个包括磨面、轧花、脱绒和弹花的综合工厂。这个厂共投资一万九千元，从1957年8月到今年2月，共加工皮棉四十万斤，磨小麦一百四十四万八千斤，磨玉米九十万斤，生产总值五十三万元。
    这个厂每月可给农业社节约畜力两千四百头次，劳力两千一百人次。日产面粉一万三千斤，脱绒一百七十四斤。
    农业社办工厂的好处是：一、生产经营简便，费用低。厂内主任是由农业社主任兼任，工人由农业社员顶替，只记工分，不付工资。厂内只有四名学徒。二、不发生供、销和运输困难。三、厂内因人制宜，照顾老幼残弱，安排活路。四、学徒是从农村中的下放干部、学生、转业复员军人中挑选的，这些人有文化，稍加训练即可掌握技术。
