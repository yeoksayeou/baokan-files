Great Debate, Great Cooperation
Shangqiu County Communes Prepare Busily for Summer Harvest and Planting

With golden wheat waves promising a bountiful harvest, Shangqiu County, Henan Province, is busily preparing for the summer harvest and planting.

The four hundred and fifty-one agricultural communes in Shangqiu County have widely organized a great debate on summer harvesting and planting issues, actively carrying out preparations. When the Third Team of the Zhonghua No. 1 Commune in Daokou Township was discussing this issue, commune member Huang Shicheng advocated, "It's only just started summer; it's not too late to prepare in ten days." Liu Yujing also said, "Harvesting and planting are old routines, happening every year, why panic so much." This statement was refuted by many commune members. Gao Guicai overcame the complacency of all commune members by using accounting and comparison. He said, "Last year, our commune's wheat yield was only 170 jin per mu. This year, we can harvest 400 jin per mu. The task of harvesting and threshing is twice as big. Last year, we planted 950 mu of sweet potatoes, applying 3,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. This year, we're planting 1,800 mu, applying 50,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Last year, we planted a lot of soybeans; this year, we're changing to planting 100 mu of rice. Last year, the water conservancy equipment was poor, and we built more than 300 mu of terraced fields. This year, the water source is sufficient, and all 2,911 mu of wheat stubble land will be turned into terraced fields. This year's summer harvest and planting tasks are more than twice as big as in previous years. Can we do it without preparing early?" He also reminded everyone that last year, due to poor preparation, harvesting and threshing were not timely, and the entire commune rotted more than 2,500 jin. His words convinced everyone, and on the spot, everyone offered more than 100 suggestions. After the meeting, it was already 12 o'clock at night, and a dozen young commune members began to deliver base fertilizer for summer planting crops to the wheat fields.

Now, every commune in the county, like the Third Team of the commune, has had heated debates among Party members, cadres, and commune members, recognizing that ensuring a bumper harvest of wheat this year and planting summer crops well and sufficiently is the decisive key to striving for a full-year harvest, overcoming people's complacency and wait-and-see attitude.

In order to do a good job in summer harvesting and planting, a cooperation contract was signed on May 4th at the Township Party Committee Secretary meeting, with the cooperation zone as the unit.

As of May 4th, all 451 agricultural communes in the county have formulated summer harvest and planting plans and are organizing various specialized teams for summer harvesting and planting, already transporting more than 2 billion jin of late autumn base fertilizer to the fields. For summer harvesting and planting, 1,900 large carts, new rubber-wheeled carts, and scaffolding carts have been improved, 484 mills have been improved, and more than 30,000 other advanced tools have been created, laying a good foundation for summer harvesting and planting.

    大辩论　大协作
    商丘县社社准备夏收夏种忙
    麦浪滚滚丰收在望，河南商丘县夏收夏种准备忙。
    商丘县四百五十一个农业社广泛组织夏收夏种问题大辩论，积极进行夏收夏种准备工作。道口乡中华一社第三队在讨论这一问题的时候，社员黄士臣主张“刚到立夏，过十天再准备也不晚”。刘玉敬也说：“收、种是老一套，年年有一回，何必慌恁很。”这种说法遭到了很多社员的反驳。高贵才用算账对比的方法，克服了全体社员的麻痹思想。他说：“去年咱社小麦亩产只一百七十斤，今年每亩能收四百斤，收割打场任务大一倍；去年种九百五十亩红薯，亩施底肥三千斤，今年种一千八百亩，亩施底肥五万斤；去年种豆子多，今年改种一百亩水稻；去年水利设备差，打畦田三百多亩，今年水源充足，二千九百一十一亩麦茬地要全部打成畦田。今年的夏收夏种任务比往年大两倍还多，不早动手准备能行吗？”他还提醒大家，去年因准备工作差，收割打场不及时，全社烂二千五百多斤。他这话说的大家口服心服，当场大家献出一百多条计策。会后，已是夜十二点了，十几个青年社员就动手往麦地送夏播作物的底肥。
    现在全县的每个社，都和该社第三队一样，在党员、干部和社员中间进行了热烈的争辩，认识到保证今年小麦丰产丰收、夏播作物种好种足是争取全年丰收的决定关键，克服了人们的麻痹等待思想。
    为了做好夏收夏种工作，在5月4日乡党委书记会议上，以协作区为单位，签订了协作合同。
    截至5月4日全县四百五十一个农业社已全部订出了夏收夏种规划，正在组织夏收夏种中的各种专业队，已往地头运送晚秋底肥二十多亿斤。为夏收夏种改良大车、新装胶轮车、架子车等一千九百辆，改良磨四百八十四盘，其他先进工具三万多件，为夏收夏种打下了良好基础。（中共商丘县委办公室）
