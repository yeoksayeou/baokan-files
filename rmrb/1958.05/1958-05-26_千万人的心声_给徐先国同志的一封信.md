    The Heartfelt Voice of Millions
    ——A Letter to Comrade Xu Xianguo
    Wang Zhen
    I was deeply moved when I read your poem "Never Lay Down the Gun" in the People's Daily on May 7th. You sang out my heartfelt voice. I believe that we, our tens of thousands of comrades, will sing in chorus with you.
    "A red heart dedicated to the Party, a hero doffs his uniform and returns to the battlefield," "Using the hand that held the gun to pick up the hoe, forcing the land to yield its food." Yes, under the call of Chairman Mao, we have precisely embarked on the glorious post of production and construction.
    The vigor of 600 million people in building socialism has produced so many inspiring poems! Not long ago, I discussed with Guo Lao the situation of the People's Liberation Army soldiers going to state-owned farms and ranches across the country to participate in production work. He enthusiastically wrote a poem entitled "War Against the Earth" to praise the People's Liberation Army, and recited it to me on the spot. At that time, I felt that it was not just me, but as if there were tens of thousands of comrades listening. This is the infectious power of the works of the "engineer of the human soul." Your poem represents our fighting will and expresses the readers' gratitude to Guo Lao's beautiful praise.
    I think your poem is the voice of the Great Northern Wilderness fighters. I have already asked the comrades of the General Political Department's慰问团 [comfort group] to set it to music. I suggest you change "Let the blood-stained military uniform be rewarded by machine oil and mud. Let the scars pierced by bullets glow red on the black earth" to:
    "Let the victorious and glorious military uniform,
    Be rewarded by machine oil and mud.
    Let the strong and powerful arms,
    Radiate red light on the black earth."
    I feel that the two lines I suggested to modify, as a poem and a specific person, may be revealing the inner feelings of yourself and many of our comrades, which is very touching. But in order to set it to music and let more heroic comrades who have not been injured sing together, I would like to make the above changes. At the same time, the mood during singing will be more harmonious and joyful. Of course, this suggestion may not be appropriate and is for your reference only.
    It seems that you have already gone to the Great Northern Wilderness. I hope that you and the comrades around you will be as heroic and bold as described in your poem, "A red heart dedicated to the Party, a hero doffs his uniform and never lays down the gun."
    Recently I met with Guo Lao again. He said that he also liked your poem very much and thanked you.

    千万人的心声
    ——给徐先国同志的一封信
    王震
    在5月7日人民日报第八版上，读到了你的诗“永不放下枪”，我深深感动了。你唱出了我的心声。我相信，我们成千上万的同志们都会同你合唱。
    “一颗红心交给党，英雄解甲重上战场，”“用拿枪的手把起锄头，强迫土地交出食粮。”是的，在毛主席的号召下，我们正是这样地走上了生产建设的光荣岗位。
    六亿人民建设社会主义的干劲，产生了多少鼓舞人心的诗啊！不久以前，我同郭老谈论过人民解放军将士赴全国各地参加国营农牧场的生产工作的情形，他热情地写了以“向地球开战”为题的歌颂人民解放军的诗篇，而且当场为我朗诵一遍。我当时就觉得并不是我一个人，仿佛有千万个同志在倾听，这是“人类灵魂的工程师”的作品的感染力，你的诗代表了我们的战斗意志并代表了读者向郭老的美好歌颂致谢。
    你这首诗我认为是北大荒战士们的声音，我已经请总政治部慰问团的同志把它谱成歌曲。我建议你把“让血迹浸染的军装，受到机油和泥土的奖赏。让子弹穿透的疤伤，在黑土地上泛红发光。”改成这样：
    “让胜利光荣的军装，
    受到机油和泥土的奖赏。
    让坚强有力的臂膀，
    在黑土地上焕发红光。”
    我觉得，我建议修改的两句，作为诗和具体的人，也许就像你和我们许多同志，是揭示本身内心的感情，是很动人的。但是为了把它谱成歌曲，使更广大的英勇的没有负伤的同志一齐歌唱自己，我就想作以上的修改。同时，在歌唱时的情绪上会更和谐，更欢乐些。当然，这个建议未必妥当，只供你参考而已。
    看样子，你是已经到北大荒去了。希望你和你的周围的同志们，如同你的诗中所描绘的那样英勇，豪迈，“一颗红心交给党，英雄解甲永不放下枪”。
    最近我又会到郭老，他说他也很喜欢你的诗并谢谢你。
