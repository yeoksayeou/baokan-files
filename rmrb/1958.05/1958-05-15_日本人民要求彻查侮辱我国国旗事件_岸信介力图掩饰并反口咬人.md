Xinhua News Agency, May 14th, Tokyo dispatch: The Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association submitted a statement to the Nagasaki local authorities on the 13th, insisting that Kanto, the Japanese thug who tore down the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki, be tried for the crime of damaging a foreign national flag.

Since the incident on May 2nd at the Chinese postage stamp and paper-cut exhibition in Nagasaki, where Japanese thugs, with the connivance of the Nobusuke Kishi government, insulted the Chinese national flag, the Nobusuke Kishi government has adopted a protective attitude, refusing to handle it seriously, and attempting to let it drop. Under the strong condemnation of the Chinese and Japanese people, the Nobusuke Kishi government instructed the Nagasaki Police Department to "summon" Kanto on the 12th, attempting to continue playing tricks to cover up the behind-the-scenes relationship of its connivance and protection of thugs who insulted the Chinese national flag incident, and to shirk its serious responsibility for the incident.

According to Kyodo News, Kanto emphasized during the "interrogation" by the Nagasaki Police Department that "my actions have no background." He only tore down the Chinese national flag because he saw that the Japanese national flag was not hung at the exhibition venue and therefore "his anger flared up." According to him, he immediately expressed his "apologies" to the organizers and relevant parties afterward. However, people remember that before this incident, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "embassy" in Tokyo had requested the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take down the Chinese national flag hanging at the Chinese postage stamp and paper-cut exhibition venue. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs then issued a notice to the Nagasaki Municipal Government and "advised" the organizers of the exhibition to take down the Chinese national flag. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "consul" stationed in Nagasaki also made the same request to the person in charge of the exhibition through the Nagasaki Municipal Government. After the unreasonable demands of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Nobusuke Kishi government were sternly rejected by the Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the incident of thugs insulting the Chinese national flag occurred. At that time, the police had no choice but to arrest the thugs, but immediately released them.

After the Nagasaki Police Department staged the farce of "interrogating" Kanto, the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet held a meeting on the 13th to discuss the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag. The meeting decided to "wait and see the situation for the time being without taking special measures." This means that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet will continue to adopt a delaying and conniving attitude, and persist in its policy of being hostile to the Chinese people.

From the opinions revealed by Kyodo News at the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet meeting, it can be seen that the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet is trying to minimize the seriousness of the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag. The Nobusuke Kishi government is afraid that the political background of the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag will be exposed. It insisted that "the truth of the incident is very simple; even whether it should be charged with damaging miscellaneous objects is a problem," and said that the thug Kanto "although he tore down the national flag hanging at the venue, he immediately picked it up and expressed his apologies, which is not a problem legally." From this, it can be seen that the Nagasaki Police Department's "summoning" of Kanto was actually to create a "legal basis" for exonerating him of political responsibility, and to falsely accuse the Chinese side's attitude as "exploiting the issue with political intentions."

Not only that, but the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet, in order to shirk responsibility, even stoops to the despicable act of tampering with its own laws at any time. The opinion of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet meeting on the 13th even argued that "if a national flag is not hung by a state official organ, it cannot be treated as a national flag." The absurdity of this opinion of the Nobusuke Kishi Cabinet has reached an unparalleled level. Even according to Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law regarding the handling of crimes of insulting foreign national flags, there is absolutely no distinction between hanging in "official organs" and "non-official organs." This absurd opinion shows how ridiculously clumsy the methods adopted by the Nobusuke Kishi government to cover up and shirk its responsibility for conniving and protecting thugs who insulted the Chinese national flag are.

According to Kyodo News, the Nobusuke Kishi government feels that the issue of insulting the Chinese national flag has produced a "subtle influence" among the Japanese people, and therefore it believes that it is necessary to spread fallacies, confuse right and wrong, and deceive the Japanese people.

### 日本人民要求彻查侮辱我国国旗事件  岸信介力图掩饰并反口咬人

　　日本人民要求彻查侮辱我国国旗事件
    岸信介力图掩饰并反口咬人
    新华社14日讯　东京消息：日中友好协会长崎分会13日向长崎地方当局递交一项声明，坚持要求以破坏外国国旗的罪行审讯在长崎扯下中国国旗的日本暴徒关东。
    自从5月2日在长崎中国邮票和剪纸展览会上日本暴徒在岸信介政府纵容下侮辱中国国旗以后，岸信介政府一直采取包庇的态度，拒绝加以严肃的处理，企图不了了之。在中国和日本人民的强烈指责下，岸信介政府曾经指令长崎警察署在12日“传讯”了关东，企图继续耍花招来掩盖它纵容和包庇暴徒侮辱中国国旗事件的幕后关系和推卸它对这一事件所应承担的严重责任。
    据共同社报道，关东在长崎警察署受“讯问”时强调说明，“我的行动并没有什么背景”。他只是因为在展览会会场上看到没有悬挂日本国旗，因此“火一上来”就扯下了中国国旗。据他说，他在事后立即向主办人和有关方面表示了“歉意”。但是，人们记得，在发生这次事件以前，蒋介石集团驻东京“大使馆”曾经要求日本外务省，把悬挂在中国邮票和剪纸展览会会场上的中国国旗取下来。日本外务省随即向长崎市政府发出通知，并且“劝告”展览会的主办团体取下中国国旗。同时，蒋介石集团驻长崎的“领事”也曾经通过长崎市政府向展览会的负责人提出了同样要求。在蒋介石集团和岸信介政府的这种无理要求遭到日中友好协会长崎分会的严正拒绝以后，就发生了暴徒侮辱中国国旗的事件。当时，警察虽然不得不将暴徒逮捕起来。但是随即予以释放。
    在长崎警察署上演了“讯问”关东的双簧以后，岸信介内阁在13日举行会议，讨论了侮辱中国国旗的事件。会议决定“暂时静观情况，而不采取特别的措施”。这就是说，岸信介内阁将继续采取拖延和纵容的态度，坚持与中国人民为敌的政策。
    从共同社透露出来的岸信介内阁会议上的意见可以看出，岸信介内阁力图缩小侮辱中国国旗事件的严重性。岸信介政府唯恐侮辱中国国旗事件的政治背景暴露。硬说“事件的真相是非常简单的；连是否应当以损坏杂物论罪，也是一个问题”，又说甚么暴徒关东“虽然把挂在会场上的国旗扯下来了，可是它本人立刻把它拾起来，并且表示了歉意，这在法律上也就不成为问题了。”由此可见，长崎警察署“传讯”关东实际上是为替他解脱政治责任制造“法律根据”，并且借此诬赖中国方面的态度是“怀有政治意图的借题发挥”。
    不仅如此，岸信介内阁为了推脱责任，竟不惜卑鄙地随时篡改日本自己的法律。岸信介内阁13日会议的意见竟认为，“如果不是一个国家官方机关悬挂的国旗，就不能把这面国旗当作国旗来对待。”岸信介内阁这种意见的荒唐程度实在到了无以复加的地步，即使根据关于处理侮辱外国国旗的罪行的日本刑法第九十二条，其中也完全没有悬挂在“官方机关”和“非官方机关”的区别规定。这种荒谬的意见说明，岸信介政府为了掩盖和推卸它的纵容和包庇暴徒侮辱中国国旗的责任所采用的手法，笨拙到多么可笑的地步。
    据共同社透露，岸信介政府感觉到侮辱中国国旗的问题在日本人民中间产生了“微妙的影响”，因而它认为有必要散布谬论，混淆是非欺骗日本人民。
