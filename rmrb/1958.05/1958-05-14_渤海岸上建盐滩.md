　　Building Salt Fields on the Bohai Coast
    South of Jin County, Liaoning, near the Bohai Sea, there is an area of ​​more than one hundred square miles that is frequently eroded by seawater. It is very alkaline and nothing grows there. The masses call it the "Old Alkali Beach." This year, after the state proposed a plan to improve the Old Alkali Beach into a salt field, the Jinzhou Salt Field Chemical Department Survey Company surveyed this land and prepared to build a salt field in this narrow, flat area stretching from the Bohai coast in the south to the coastal villages in the north, from the Daling River in the east to the Xiaoling River in the west. The western part has already begun construction and renovation, and nearby villages and communes are organizing laborers to prepare for full-scale construction.

　　渤海岸上建盐滩
    辽宁锦县南面、靠近渤海方圆有百余平方里的地方，经常受海水浸蚀，碱性很大，不生一草一木，群众都叫它“老碱滩”。今年国家提出改良老碱滩成盐场的计划后，锦州盐场化工部勘察公司测量了这块土地，准备把南起渤海沿岸，北至沿海各乡，东起大凌河，西至小凌河的这一个狭长的平坦地带建成盐场。现在西半部已经开始动工改建，附近各乡社正组织民工为全面施工做准备工作。
