Nineteenth century, Marxism was widely spread among the working masses. "The theoretical victory of Marxism compels its enemies to also put on a set of Marxist clothes." (Lenin: "The Historical Destiny of the Doctrine of Marx") E. Bernstein (1850-1932), a representative figure of the right wing of the German Social Democratic Party and the leaders of the Second International, was such a person. In his early papers, Bernstein opposed the establishment of a proletarian party, advocated abandoning the proletarian revolution, and preached using reformist methods to transform capitalist society into socialist society. Marx and Engels had criticized him. Shortly after Engels' death, Bernstein openly proposed to "revise" the basic principles of Marxism in the book "The Preconditions of Socialism and the Tasks of Social Democracy." The term "revisionism" originated from this. His "evolutionary socialism" was also strung together with his revisionist ideas. Bernstein demanded the abandonment of the working class's revolutionary struggle and opposed the implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He tried to eliminate the revolutionary essence of Marxism and turn it into a doctrine of reformism. Bernstein insisted that socialism was not a science, but only a "moral issue" and a "ethical" ideal, and only a fantasy that people could not realize. Bernstein made every effort to oppose Marx's theory of value, the law of capitalist accumulation, and the law of absolute and relative pauperization of the proletariat under the capitalist system. He said that Marx's labor theory of value should be supplemented by the "theory" of the Austrian school. Bernstein attempted to prove that the phenomena of production concentration and large-scale production squeezing out small-scale production would not occur in agriculture, and that they were proceeding very slowly in industry and commerce. Bernstein attempted to use his theory of "democratization of share capital" to explain that the role of the middle class increased with the development of capitalism, and the face of the bourgeoisie had changed due to the increase in the number of small shareholders. Moreover, Bernstein tried to prove that capitalism could be overthrown without revolutionary methods. Bernstein claimed that violent methods could be used against the feudal order, but not against the capitalist order. He said: "The difference between all the liberal institutions of modern society and feudalism lies precisely in the fact that these institutions have flexibility, the ability to transform and develop. There is no need to destroy these institutions, just develop them forward. To develop these institutions, there is a need for organization, a need for strong activities, but no need for revolutionary dictatorship." Bernstein believed that cartels and trusts eliminated the anarchy of production, and the class contradictions of capitalism were eased. Therefore, Bernstein fundamentally denied the necessity of revolutionary dictatorship. Bernstein believed that bourgeois democracy in principle wanted to eliminate classes. He also believed that universal suffrage would eliminate classes. Bernstein put forward a formula: "The ultimate goal is nothing, the movement is everything." He said: "... what I consider the movement is the general movement of society, that is, the movement of social progress, that is, the political and economic activities and organizations that promote this progress." This means that workers can only engage in some economic struggles for immediate interests, and the ultimate socialist goal is simply illusory. In philosophy, Bernstein fiercely attacked dialectical materialism. He slandered dialectics as "a great danger to science" and a "trap on the road to correct understanding." Bernstein proposed "returning to Kant" and advocated replacing Marxist philosophy with Kantianism. Bernstein believed that social development has no sudden changes, but only a gradual evolutionary process, and capitalist society will gradually "evolve" into socialist society.
    Lenin pointed out that revisionism is not a national phenomenon but an international phenomenon. At that time, France, Britain, Italy, and Austria and other European countries, successively emerged this trend of thought. Russia in the 1890's of the "legal Marxists" and "Economists" (as well as later Mensheviks, Trotskyites, Bukharinites and liquidationists), etc., are also revisionists.
    When Bernstein's revisionism appeared, revolutionary Marxists launched a struggle against it. Plekhanov, Luxemburg and others carried out a struggle against Bernstein's revisionism, defending the Marxist doctrine of class struggle. However, because they lacked a firm position and clear views on many issues, their criticism was incomplete. The leaders of the Second International did not give revisionism a powerful blow.
    K. Kautsky (1854-1938) also wrote articles against Bernstein's revisionism. However, on the fundamental issue of revolution, that is, on the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, he made a series of major concessions to Bernstein. Kautsky was a figure in the German Social Democratic Party and the Second International, and also a notorious traitor to the proletariat and a revisionist. Before Marx and Engels were alive, Kautsky had done some revolutionary work with these two proletarian leaders. However, Kautsky had betrayed and distorted Marxism in several works he wrote in the early stages of his activities. When the "centrist" forces within the German and Second International Social Democratic Parties were formed, Kautsky naturally became its leader. Kautsky actually supported Bernstein's revisionism. During the First World War, Kautsky took an even more bourgeois chauvinistic position. Kautsky negated the necessity of destroying the bourgeois state machine and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, using his own "pure," "supra-class" democratic theory, which was actually liberal bourgeois, to oppose the doctrine of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He put forward the anti-Marxist "ultra-imperialism theory," insisting that under the conditions of imperialism it seemed possible to eliminate war and establish an organized world economy by means of mutual consultation among capitalists of various countries. He also promoted the vulgar "theory of productive forces," believing that socialism seemed to be a mechanical result of the development of social productive forces, and did not need to go through class struggle and revolution. After the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, Kautsky's counter-revolutionary "theoretical" activities and practical activities became even more rampant. He helped the German right-wing Social Democrats to destroy the German Revolution of 1918-1919, slandered the dictatorship of the proletariat and Marxism, and opposed dialectical materialism and historical materialism.
    Rudolf Hilferding (1877-1941) of Austria was also an opportunist of the Second International. In the early stages of his activities, he expressed support for Marxism. Later, he turned to the position of the enemies of Marxism. However, for a considerable period of time, he still wore the mask of the "orthodox" of the teachings of Marx and Engels. In his book "Finance Capital" (1910), Hilferding made a scientific analysis of certain aspects of the imperialist economy, while at the same time obliterating the decisive role of monopoly organizations in modern capitalism, obliterating the facts of the intensification of internal and external contradictions of modern capitalism, and ignoring the most important features of imperialism - the parasitic and decadent nature of capitalism and the struggle to divide the world. During the period of temporary and partial stability of capitalism, Hilferding falsely claimed that the era of "organized capitalism" had arrived, that the activities of monopoly organizations would eliminate competition, the anarchy of production, and crises, and that planned and conscious organization would occupy a dominant position. According to this "theory," monopoly organizations can peacefully "transform" into a planned socialist economy, so all the proletariat has to do is help the trust bosses and bankers arrange the economy, so that modern capitalism will gradually "grow into" socialism peacefully without any struggle or revolution.
    At the beginning of this century, Lenin thoroughly exposed the reactionary essence of revisionism and defended and developed Marxism. Today, the ideas of old revisionism have increasingly weakened its influence in the international workers' movement, so the imperialists have to find a new weapon, which is modern revisionism. The ideological essence of modern revisionism is consistent with that of old revisionism. However, it is put forward by parties that hold state power and wear the cloak of Marxism, so its danger is even greater. In order to defend and develop Marxism-Leninism, we must wage an irreconcilable struggle against the trend of modern revisionism. (Jing)

    伯恩斯坦、考茨基、希佛亭是什么人
    十九世纪末叶，马克思主义在工人群众中有了广泛的流传。“马克思主义在理论上的胜利，逼得它的敌人也换上一套马克思主义者的衣衫。”（列宁：“马克思学说底历史命运”）德国社会民主党右翼和第二国际的领袖埃·伯恩斯坦（1850—1932），就是这样的一个代表人物。伯恩斯坦在早期的论文中就反对建立无产阶级的政党，主张抛弃无产阶级革命，宣扬用改良主义的方法把资本主义社会改造为社会主义社会。马克思和恩格斯曾经批判过他。恩格斯逝世后不久，伯恩斯坦就在“社会主义的前提和社会民主党的任务”一书中，公开提出要“修正”马克思主义的基本原理。“修正主义”这个名称，就是由此而来的。他的“进化的社会主义”同样是串穿着他的修正主义思想的。伯恩斯坦要求抛弃工人阶级的革命斗争，反对实行无产阶级专政。他力图取消马克思主义的革命实质，使它变成改良主义的学说。伯恩斯坦硬说，社会主义不是科学，只是“道德问题”和“伦理上的”理想，并且只是人们不可能实现的幻想。伯恩斯坦竭力反对马克思的价值论、资本主义积累的规律、资本主义制度下无产阶级绝对贫困化和相对贫困化的规律。他说，马克思的劳动价值论要由奥国学派的“理论”来补充。伯恩斯坦企图证明，生产集中和大生产排挤小生产的现象，在农业方面是不会发生的，而且在工商业方面也进行得十分缓慢。恩斯坦企图以他的“股份资本民主化”的理论来说明中间阶层的作用随着资本主义的发展而增大了，资产阶级的面貌已因小的股份所有者人数增多而有了变化。并且，伯恩斯坦力图证明不用革命的方法可以推翻资本主义。伯恩斯坦声称，对封建秩序可以采用暴力方法，而对资本主义秩序却不能采用暴力方法。他说：“现代社会所有的自由派典章制度跟封建主义的不同恰恰在于，这些典章制度有伸缩性，有转变和发展的能力。用不着打毁这些典章制度，只消把这些典章制度向前发展就行了。为了发展这些典章制度，需要有组织，需要有强有力的活动，却不需要有革命的专政。”伯恩斯坦认为，卡特尔和托辣斯消除了生产的无政府状态，资本主义的阶级矛盾缓和了。因此，伯恩斯坦根本否认革命专政的必要性。伯恩斯坦认为资产阶级民主制在原则上是要消灭阶级的。他还认为普选权会消灭阶级。伯恩斯坦提出一个公式：“最终目的算不得什么，运动就是一切。”他说：“……所谓运动我认为就是社会的一般运动，也就是社会进步的运动，也就是促进这种进步的政治的和经济的活动和组织。”这就是说，工人只能为了眼前利益进行一些经济斗争，最终的社会主义目标根本是虚无的。伯恩斯坦在哲学上猛烈地攻击辩证唯物主义。他诬蔑辩证法“对于科学是一个极大的危险”，是“走向正确认识道路上的陷阱”。伯恩斯坦提出“回到康德那里去”，倡议以康德主义来代替马克思主义的哲学。伯恩斯坦认为，社会发展没有突变，而只是逐渐进化的过程，资本主义社会会逐渐地“演进”到社会主义社会。
    列宁指出，修正主义不是民族现象而是国际现象。当时，法国、英国、意大利和奥地利等欧洲国家，都先后出现这种思潮。俄国在上世纪九十年代出现的“合法马克思主义者”和“经济主义者”（以及后来的孟什维主义者、托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子和取消主义者）等等，也都是修正主义者。
    当伯恩斯坦的修正主义出现的时候，革命的马克思主义者就对它展开了斗争。普列哈诺夫、卢森堡等都进行了反对伯恩斯坦的修正主义的斗争，捍卫了马克思主义的阶级斗争学说。但是，由于他们在许多问题上缺乏坚定的立场和明确的观点，所以他们的批判是不彻底的。第二国际的领导者并没有给修正主义以有力的打击。
    卡·考茨基（1854—1938）也曾著文反对伯恩斯坦的修正主义。但是，他在革命的根本问题上，即在无产阶级专政问题上，对伯恩斯坦作了一系列重大的让步。考茨基是一个德国社会民主党和第二国际的人物，也是一个臭名昭彰的无产阶级叛徒和修正主义者。在马克思、恩格斯生前，考茨基曾经同这两位无产阶级领袖在一起做过一些革命工作。但是，考茨基还在他活动的初期所写的若干著作中，就曾背弃了和歪曲了马克思主义。当德国和第二国际社会民主党内的“中派”势力形成的时候，考茨基很自然地成了它的头子。考茨基在实际上支持了伯恩斯坦的修正主义。到了第一次世界大战期间，考茨基更采取了资产阶级沙文主义的立场。考茨基否定摧毁资产阶级国家机器和建立无产阶级专政的必要性，以他自己的实际上是自由资产阶级的“纯粹的”、“超阶级的”民主制理论来同无产阶级专政的学说相对立。他提出反马克思主义的“超帝国主义论”，硬说在帝国主义条件下似乎可以用各国资本家互相协商的办法来消弭战争以及建立有组织的世界经济。他还宣传庸俗的“生产力论”，认为社会主义似乎是社会生产力发展的机械的结果，不必经过阶级斗争和革命。伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后，考茨基的反革命的“理论”活动和实际活动越发猖狂了。他帮助德国右翼社会民主党人摧残1918—1919年的德国革命，诬蔑无产阶级专政和马克思主义，反对辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义。
    奥地利的鲁·希佛亭（1877—1941），也是一个第二国际的机会主义者。他在活动的初期，曾经表示拥护马克思主义。后来，他转到马克思主义的敌人的立场上去了。但是，他在相当长的时期内仍然戴着马克思、恩格斯学说的“正统派”的面具。希佛亭在他的“财政资本”（1910年）一书中，对帝国主义经济的若干方面作了科学的分析，而同时却抹煞了垄断组织在现代资本主义中的决定作用，抹煞了现代资本主义内外矛盾的尖锐化的事实，忽视了帝国主义的最重要的特征——资本主义的寄生性和腐朽性和瓜分世界的斗争。在资本主义暂时局部稳定时期，希佛亭妄言“有组织的资本主义”纪元已经来到，——垄断组织的活动将使竞争、生产无政府状态和危机归于消灭，并且将使有计划的有意识的组织占居统治地位。按照这个“理论”，垄断组织能够和平地“转变”为有计划的社会主义经济，因此，无产阶级要做的就只是帮助托辣斯老板和银行家们安排经济，这样，现代资本主义就会逐渐地不经过任何斗争和革命而和平地“长入”社会主义。
    在本世纪初期，列宁彻底地揭穿了修正主义的反动实质，保卫了和发展了马克思主义。今天旧的修正主义的思想在国际工人运动中已经越来越减弱了它的影响，因而帝国主义者就要找到一个新的武器，这就是现代修正主义。现代修正主义的思想本质是同旧的修正主义一致的。但是它是由掌握着国家政权的披着马克思主义外衣的党派所提出的，因此，它的危险性就更大。为了保卫和发展马克思列宁主义，我们必须同现代修正主义的思潮进行不调和的斗争。　　　（静）
