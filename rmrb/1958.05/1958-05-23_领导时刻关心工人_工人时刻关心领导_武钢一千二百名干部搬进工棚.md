Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation: 1,200 Cadres Move into Work Sheds

(Our Wuhan, May 22nd dispatch) Reporter Feng Jian reports: According to statistics from fourteen engineering companies and construction units affiliated with Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, over 1,200 cadres have already moved into work sheds to eat, live, and work alongside workers.

After leading cadres implemented the "three togethers" with workers, the distance and estrangement between leaders and the masses of workers has been eliminated or is being eliminated, and a brand new relationship of mutual understanding between comrades and friends is rapidly being established. When Ke Daguo, a Party branch committee member and technician from the First Engineering Company, first moved into the dormitory of plasterer Gu Guanfu's team, the workers were very cold and distant towards him, and would leave after only one or two sentences. However, Ke Daguo insisted on participating in labor, even carrying mortar while sick; after work, he would take the initiative to clean the dormitory and help the workers air out their bedding; on Sundays, he would visit the workers' homes and have heart-to-heart talks. Once, when worker Xiong Fusheng's grandmother died, he braved the rain to help Xiong Fusheng with the funeral arrangements. In this way, the workers of Gu Guanfu's team quickly became friends with Ke Daguo and shared their innermost thoughts with him. At the coking plant construction site, cadres of the furnace building team who implemented the "three togethers" worked alongside the workers from morning till night, delivering materials to the site. The workers would often concernedly advise the cadres to rest more and not exhaust themselves. Everyone happily said, "Now, leaders are constantly thinking of the workers, and the workers are constantly thinking of the leaders."

It has become a common practice for leading cadres to go deep into the front lines and solve key problems in construction in a timely manner. The offices of the fourteen engineering companies and construction units have already moved to the busy construction sites; most of the personnel in the functional departments of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation have also gone to the front lines to solve problems. In the past two months, the leaders of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation have been assigned specific tasks to solve the equipment problems that threatened the early iron tapping of No. 1 blast furnace, and this has already achieved great results. At present, leaders at all levels are taking responsibility for solving new problems that have emerged in construction.

    领导时刻关心工人  工人时刻关心领导
    武钢一千二百名干部搬进工棚
    本报武汉22日电　记者冯健报道：据武汉钢铁公司所属十四个工程公司和施工单位的统计，目前已经有一千二百多名干部，搬进工棚，和工人同吃、同住、同劳动。
    领导干部实行和工人“三同”以后，消除了或正在消除着领导和职工群众之间的距离和隔膜，一种崭新的心心相印的同志和朋友关系正在迅速建立。第一工程公司党支部委员、技术员柯大国，刚搬进粉刷工顾关福小组的宿舍时，工人们对他很冷淡、疏远，谈不上一两句话就走了。但是柯大国坚持参加劳动，甚至冒病挑灰浆；下班后主动打扫宿舍清洁，替工人晒被褥；星期天到工人家里串门谈心。有一次，工人熊富生的祖母死了，他冒雨为熊富生办理丧事。就是这样，顾关福小组的工人们迅速和柯大国交成了朋友，都跟他谈吐长期积淤在心里的知心话。在炼焦化工厂工地上实行“三同”的筑炉一队的干部，从早到晚和工人一起跟班劳动，把材料送到现场，工人们不时关心地劝干部多休息，不要累坏了。大家都愉快地说，现在是：领导时刻念着工人，工人时刻念着领导。
    领导干部深入现场及时解决建设中的关键问题，已经蔚成风气。十四个工程公司和施工单位的办公室，都已经搬进紧张的施工现场；武钢总公司职能处室的大部分人员，也做到了下现场去解决问题。两个多月来，武钢的领导人分工包干，解决危及一号高炉提前出铁的设备问题，已经收到了很大效果。目前各级领导干部，正在包干解决建设中新出现的问题。
