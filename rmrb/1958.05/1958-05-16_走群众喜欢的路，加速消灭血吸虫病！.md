Take the Path the Masses Love, Accelerate the Elimination of Schistosomiasis!
Li Huan, Secretary of the CPC Jiaxing Prefectural Committee, Zhejiang Province

The Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area is the most severely affected area of schistosomiasis in Zhejiang, with about 900,000 patients. The situation is particularly serious in the three counties of Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Pinghu, where an average of six out of ten people suffer from schistosomiasis, and eight or nine out of ten young and middle-aged people are infected. Schistosomiasis seriously affects the great leap forward in agricultural production and the lives and happiness of farmers. Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have treated 220,000 patients and eliminated snails on 28 million square meters in the region. However, the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis remains a serious task. We will resolutely follow the line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and strive to completely eliminate schistosomiasis within two years.

"Death Hamlet" and "Barren Field Ponds"

The masses are very eager and in need of treatment for schistosomiasis. In Jingxiang Township, Jiaxing County, schistosomiasis has been prevalent for more than 40 years. The farmers there are impoverished and sick, their families are ruined, and their fields are barren, presenting a scene of misery. In Huanqiao Hamlet, many people have died from schistosomiasis, and many households have become extinct as a result. Before 1938, there were 36 households in the village, but only 16 remained at the beginning of liberation, and only one of these 16 households had a full labor force. Therefore, the local farmers call Huanqiao Hamlet "Death Hamlet." There is also Shixie Village, which had more than 30 households and more than 200 people before the Anti-Japanese War, but only 17 households and 63 people remained at the beginning of liberation. Nine households died cleanly, and many houses became ruins, leaving more than 400 mu of fields barren. Everyone calls this place "Barren Field Ponds." The farmers here had no choice but to pray to the Great Emperor Guan for suppressing the plague demon, but the "Great Emperor Guan" did not show his divine power, so they had to flee in all directions and wander in other places.

How Can Lord Guan Compare to Chairman Mao?

Under the leadership of the Party, the farmers of Jingxiang Township have relatively thoroughly eliminated schistosomiasis after more than two years of hard work.

The "Death Hamlet" has begun to turn into "People's Prosperity Hamlet." New houses have been built on the ruins, and the barren land is full of crops. The full labor force has increased from one to eight, and eleven mu of land have been added. Xu Shourong told me that he used to be skinny and on the verge of death, and people called him "Death Embryo." After treatment, his weight increased by 35 jin, and he became a full labor force. He also got married and started a family. He was very grateful to the Party. The "Barren Field Ponds" of Shixie Village have begun to turn into "Abundant Field Ponds." The yield per mu has increased from more than 100 jin to 580 jin. Sun Guanrong recounted that he had begged with his mother since he was a child, and at the age of 24, he still looked like a child, weighing only 70 jin and unable to work. After treatment, his weight increased to 114 jin, and he became a strong and healthy young man. Last year, he earned more than 2,200 work points. He gratefully said, "Only the Communist Party is the great benefactor who saves us from suffering."

Zhang Aliang from Zhangjiadai, Jiaxing County, was allocated land during the land reform and also joined the cooperative, but schistosomiasis made him unable to work, and he still had no food or clothing. He was cured of the disease the year before last, and last year he earned more than 2,000 work points, added five new clothes and a new quilt, bought a wooden bed, and repaired the leaking house. He told everyone he met that Chairman Mao saved his two lives, one was his human life and the other was his poor life. Chen Fuzhen had been married for eighteen years without children, and the couple was at odds. She was cured of the disease last spring, and gave birth to a fat child in the winter, and the whole family was overjoyed. The masses said, "Under the leadership of the Communist Party, even iron trees can blossom." Now, the Guandi Temple is deserted, and people are grateful to the Communist Party. In the hearts of the people: How can Lord Guan compare to Chairman Mao!

Among the 5,740 patients treated in this township, 2,870 people changed from semi-labor force to full labor force; 1,148 people recovered from no labor force to semi-labor force. The unit yield of the township jumped from more than 300 jin to 576 jin, not only eliminating barren fields, but also reclaiming more than 500 mu of wasteland. Last year, 9.48 million jin of surplus grain was sold, an increase of 1.14 million jin compared with three years ago. More than 80 young people who could not marry due to illness also got married; 13 women who could not have children due to illness the year before last had 12 children after treatment. In the past two years, the population of the township has increased by more than 1,100 people, more than 150 new houses have been built, and the township has changed from three primary schools with 154 students to sixteen primary schools with 1,694 students. This year, six agricultural middle schools have also been established. The farmers of this township are working enthusiastically to achieve the goal of becoming a thousand-jin township.

A Leap Forward in One Month, Better Than Two Years

We have been fighting schistosomiasis for more than two years, but the past and present have brought two different effects and experiences. In the past two years, a total of 70,000 patients were treated. This spring, 45,000 patients were treated in three months, while 105,000 patients were treated in April alone. If compared by month, April is equivalent to seven times the number of patients treated in the first three months of this year and equivalent to thirty-six times the number of patients treated in the previous two years. At present, the vast number of farmers, medical personnel, and rural cadres are very enthusiastic about the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. The schistosomiasis prevention and treatment plan, like other plans, has been broken through again and again. It is really a vigorous and rapid development. It, together with other work, has shown an unprecedented leap forward. So what factors have contributed to this leap forward?

The Body Must Also Make a Great Leap Forward

The great leap forward in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis came with the great leap forward in production. A commune member from Jiabei Township, Xu Boying, said it well: "Production must make a great leap forward, and the body must also make a great leap forward." The masses deeply understand that to speed up the pace of construction, they must have a healthy physique. Many patients were very unhappy when they saw others working vigorously and they could not exert themselves. They said, "The old and young, men and women are all working hard, and I only eat and do nothing, which makes me feel very sad." In particular, some young patients in the late stage of the disease were originally pessimistic and disappointed about their personal future. This time, encouraged by the great leap forward, they also patted their big bellies and asked for treatment. A young man from Jiabei Township said, "I am still young and want to live a socialist life, so I am determined to get treatment." The current situation is: wherever the production enthusiasm is particularly high, the masses' demand for treatment is particularly high.

However, this urgent demand of the masses was not understood by all comrades at the beginning. Many cadres only saw the current shortage of labor and one-sidedly believed that the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis was in contradiction with the great leap forward in production. To engage in production, one could not engage in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis. Some cadres openly said, "I agree with every article of the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program, but I have objections to the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis." "Is the current rural work to engage in production or to treat schistosomiasis?" Many medical personnel also did not understand the relationship between production and the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis, thinking that the masses were "superstitious" and "backward" and did not ask for treatment. However, the Party grasped the wishes and demands of the masses, grasped the relationship between labor and production, introduced living people and living things, organized special debates, and the average comrades were able to understand the truth that the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis should be combined with production, and proposed methods to ensure that both production and treatment would not be delayed in terms of labor arrangement. After many township and commune cadres had their thinking straightened out, they changed their original backward plans. Many township general branch secretaries personally went to the cooperatives to organize and mobilize the masses for treatment. Some comrades also used their own personal experience of being cured of schistosomiasis to speak everywhere and mobilize patients. After the medical personnel had their thinking straightened out, they submitted letters of determination one after another, requesting to go deep into the countryside to support the great leap forward in production. They are now working hard day and night to carry out treatment.

Establishing the ideology of the great leap forward in production and clarifying the relationship between the great leap forward in production and the fact that the body must also "leap forward" is the basic reason for the vast number of cadres, masses, and medical personnel to muster their energy. In the previous two years, because we lacked this clear concept, our enthusiasm was insufficient, our plans were conservative, we were slow and inefficient, and our progress was slow.

Take the Path the Masses Love

In addition to mustering energy, the great leap forward in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis also requires adopting methods that are greater, faster, better, and more economical.

The characteristics of medical work in the past were: setting up a hospital, staying in the towns, waiting for customers to come to the door, and long-term treatment. At that time, hospitals were located in towns, and whether they were state hospitals or joint clinics, they all had the appearance of large hospitals. They all had wards, beds, and patient meals, a set of outdated conventions. In particular, the long course of treatment and rest time required at least 30 days, which affected production and was very expensive. For example, the Jiaxing Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Hospital had more than 200 beds and more than 300 medical and administrative staff. Each patient had to spend 30 yuan on hospitalization fees (excluding medical expenses) as soon as they entered the hospital, and only more than 2,000 patients could be treated in a year. The Xinfeng Township Joint Clinic also followed this old method, living in the town. In the second half of 1956, eight medical personnel treated 195 patients, spending more than 4,000 yuan, with each patient bearing an average of 27 yuan, which the farmers were very unhappy about. This was a major reason for the past practice of schistosomiasis prevention and treatment being slow, costly, and inefficient.

This year, under the situation of the great leap forward, the working methods and ideological style of the medical personnel have also undergone a major change. The current working methods are: going deep into the countryside, delivering medicine to the door, combining with production, and short-term treatment. At present, the method of going deep into the countryside, setting up hospitals on the spot, having multiple points in one group, and conducting mobile treatment is generally adopted. Generally, a two- or three-day treatment is used, which takes a total of six or seven days, and labor can be restored. The time is short, the cost is low, and the masses applaud and welcome it. The Wang Sutai Schistosomiasis Prevention and Treatment Team in Tianning Township, Jiashan County, had four medical personnel and also trained two health workers for the commune. In one phase (six days), they received 197 patients, divided into six points (small wards) according to natural villages and delivered medicine to the door for 19 households. They used civilian houses and temples as wards, door panels as beds, and brought their own bedding and meals. They used the two-day treatment method, discharged patients after six days, and the patients only had to bear 1.8 yuan. They also came up with many ways to overcome difficulties. When dealing with emergency illnesses, they adopted a signal contact method of inserting red flags during the day and hanging red lights at night at various points. Nurses measured body temperature and injected medicine very quickly, exceeding the previous regulations, and no medical accidents have ever occurred. Doctors rolled in the river on snowy days without going back to change clothes and insisted on treating patients. Nurses carried water, cooked food, and did everything. Regardless of heavy snow or heavy rain, they worked in various villages in turn late at night. They persisted for 39 days and nights, and the masses were very moved.

At present, because the outdated conventions have been broken, doctors go to the countryside to treat patients, adhere to advanced treatment methods, and truly serve production. Therefore, a new situation of being lively, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and being supported by the masses has emerged.

It is precisely because the methods of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results are adopted that the cadres welcome it and the farmers like it. In terms of time, it used to take 30 days, but now it only takes five or six days; in terms of cost, it used to cost dozens of yuan to see a doctor, but now it only costs two yuan; in terms of quality, the effect is the same.

Seize the Opportunity and Strive for Complete Victory

Facts have proved that only with the guiding ideology of the leap forward can we produce the working policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The lack of a great leap forward spirit is precisely the reason for the lack of enthusiasm, slow progress, poor quality, and high cost. The policy of "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results" pointed out by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is a complete and victorious policy for socialist construction, a policy of centralized leadership created by the masses, a policy of surpassing the capitalist world in economic construction, a policy of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism, and a beacon illuminating the leap forward in all work. We are determined to implement this victorious policy into all our work and accelerate socialist construction.

The great leap forward in agriculture requires solving many factors such as water conservancy, fertilizer, technology, and tools, but it is still people who realize these factors. People are the treasure of treasures in socialism. In today's great leap forward in agriculture, labor is often felt to be lacking and insufficient. The solution to this problem, in addition to improving agricultural tools and management, is to fundamentally cure patients. In addition to mechanization, eliminating diseases is an indispensable factor for improving agricultural labor productivity. The current great leap forward in production must be combined with the great leap forward in the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis.

There are still nearly 700,000 people in our region who suffer from schistosomiasis. If we follow the speed of treating more than 100,000 patients in April, then the treatment task can be completed in October this year. There are no special factors in the treatment speed in April. On the contrary, this was carried out under the conditions of intensive labor of accumulating fertilizer day and night, plowing, and transplanting rice. Then, during the slack season, the number of people treated can be even greater. Therefore, we have decided to closely arrange the work in combination with the agricultural season, and strive to basically eliminate schistosomiasis this year, and then conduct re-examinations for some relapsed patients next year. In this year's autumn and winter, we will combine water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements to eliminate snails, and then conduct repeated re-examinations to eradicate snails. At the same time, we will continue to concentrate on the management of feces in combination with fertilizer accumulation and sanitation movements. We will strive to basically complete the task of preventing and treating schistosomiasis this year. Only by accelerating the implementation of various measures for agricultural leap forward and eliminating the people's main diseases as soon as possible can we accelerate the realization of the glorious task of the National Program for Agricultural Development.

　　走群众喜欢的路，加速消灭血吸虫病！
    中共浙江省嘉兴地委书记　李焕
    杭嘉湖地区是浙江血吸虫病流行最严重的地区，共有病人九十万左右，特别是嘉兴、嘉善、平湖三个县，情况更为严重，平均每十个人中有六个人害血吸虫病，青壮年十之八、九有血吸虫病。血吸虫病严重地影响着农业生产的大跃进，影响着农民的生活和幸福。我们遵照党中央和毛主席的指示，展开防治血吸虫病工作以后，全区已经治疗病人二十二万，消灭钉螺二千八百万平方公尺。但是防治血吸虫病还是一个严重的任务。我们坚决遵循多快好省的路线，力争在两年内彻底消灭血吸虫病。
    “死人浜”“荒田漾”
    群众对治疗血吸虫病是十分迫切和需要的。嘉兴县有个净相乡，血吸虫病流行了四十余年，那里的农民，贫病交迫，家破人亡，田园荒芜，呈现着一片凄惨的景象。这里有个环桥浜，死于血吸虫病的人很多，许多户因此而绝种灭代。1938年前全村三十六户，到解放初只剩十六户了，这十六户里只有一个全劳动力，所以当地农民都称环桥浜为“死人浜”。这里还有个石蟹村，抗战前还有三十多户，二百多人，到解放初只剩下十七户，六十三人了，有九户死得干干净净，许多房屋变成残垣废墟，荒芜了四百多亩田，大家叫这里为“荒田漾”。这里的农民无可奈何，只得仰求关公大帝镇压瘟魔，但是“关公大帝”不显神威，于是他们只好四出逃命，流落异乡。
    关帝哪能比毛主席
    净相乡的农民在党的领导下，经过两年多的苦战，已经较彻底的消灭了血吸虫病。
  “死人浜”开始变成了“人兴浜”，废墟上建起了新屋，荒地上种满了庄稼，全劳动力由一个变为八个了，还增种了十一亩田。那里的徐寿荣告诉我，原来他骨瘦如柴，奄奄待毙，人家叫他“死人坯子”，治病后体重净增三十五斤，变成了全劳动力，还讨了老婆成了家，他对党感激不已。石蟹村的“荒田漾”已开始变“丰田漾”了，由以前亩产粮食百余斤提高到亩产五百八十斤了，这里的孙关荣诉说他从小随母亲讨饭，二十四岁还像个小孩子，体重只有七十多斤，不能劳动，治病后体重增到一百一十四斤，变成身强力壮的好小伙子，去年作了二千二百多个工分，他感激地说：“世上只有共产党才是救苦救难的大恩人”。
    嘉兴县张家埭的张阿良，土地改革分到了田，也参加了合作社，可是血吸虫病害得他不能劳动，还是衣食无着。前年帮他治好了病，去年做了二千多个工分，添了五件新衣和一条新被，买了木床，修了漏房，他逢人就说：毛主席救了他两条命，一条是人命，一条是穷命。妇女陈福珍结婚十八年没有生育，夫妇不和，去年春天治好了病，冬天就生了个胖小孩，一家欢天喜地。群众说：“共产党领导，铁树也开了花”。现在，关帝庙已冷冷清清，人们口口声声感激共产党。在人们的心眼里：关帝哪能比毛主席！
    这个乡经过治疗的五千七百四十个病人中，有二千八百七十个人由半劳动力变为整劳动力；有一千一百四十八人由无劳动力恢复为半劳动力。全乡的单位产量由原先的三百多斤跃为五百七十六斤，不仅消灭了荒田，还开垦了五百多亩荒地。去年卖余粮九百四十八万斤，比三年前增加一百一十四万斤，八十多对因病不能结婚的青年也结了婚；前年十三个妇女因病不能生育，治病后就有十二个生育了。两年来全乡人口增加了一千一百多人，新盖房子一百五十多间，全乡由三所小学、一百五十四个学生，变为十六所小学、一千六百九十四个学生，今年还办了六所农业中学。这个乡的农民正在热火朝天地争取实现千斤乡。
    跃进一月，胜过两年
    我们向血吸虫病作斗争已有两年多的时间了，但是，过去和今天都带来两种不同的效果和经验。前两年共治疗七万病人，今年春季三个月共治疗四万五千病人，而4月份一个月却治疗十万五千病人。如果按月份比较，4月份相当于今年前三个月的七倍，相当于前两年的三十六倍。当前广大农民、医务人员、农村干部对防治血吸虫病工作的积极性是很高的，血吸虫病防治工作计划和其他计划一样，一再被突破，真是轰轰烈烈，一日千里，它汇同其他工作一起，出现了一个空前跃进的局面。那么究竟是什么因素促成这种跃进的局面呢？
    身体也要大跃进
    血吸虫病防治工作大跃进，是随着生产大跃进而来的。嘉北乡一个社员徐帛英说得好：“生产大跃进，身体也要大跃进”。广大群众深深懂得要加速建设步伐，必须要有健全的体质。许多病患者看到别人轰轰烈烈地干，自己不能卖力，内心很不痛快，他们说，“老老小小、男男女女都在起劲干，我只吃不做，想想很难过”。特别是一些青年晚期病人，原先对个人前途悲观失望，这次在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，他们也拍着大肚子要求治病。嘉北乡一个青年说：“我还年轻，要过社会主义生活，就坚决要治病。”现在的情况是：哪里的生产劲头特别大，哪里的群众对治病的要求也就特别大。
    但是，对于广大群众这一迫切要求，开始时并不为所有的同志所了解。不少干部只看到眼前的劳力紧张，片面地认为血吸虫病防治工作与生产大跃进有矛盾，要搞生产，就不能搞血吸虫病防治工作。有些干部公开说：“农业纲要四十条我条条赞成，就是对血吸虫病防治工作有意见。”“现在农村工作是搞生产，还是搞治疗血吸虫病？”许多医务人员也是不大明白生产和血吸虫病防治工作的关系，以为群众“迷信”“落后”，不要求治病。但是，党抓住了群众的心愿和要求，抓住了劳力和生产的关系，介绍活人活事，组织专题的辩论，一般同志都能够明白生产和血吸虫病防治工作相结合的道理，并且提出生产与治病在劳力安排上两不误的办法。许多乡、社干部在搞通思想以后，改变了原来落后的计划；许多乡总支书记亲自到合作社去组织和动员群众治病，有的同志还以自己治好血吸虫病的切身体会，到处现身说法，动员病人。医务人员在搞通思想以后，纷纷递交决心书，要求深入农村支援生产大跃进。他们正在废寝忘食地紧张地进行治疗工作。
    树立了生产大跃进思想，明确了生产大跃进与身体也要“跃进”的关系，这正是广大干部、群众和医务人员鼓足干劲的基本原因。前两年由于我们缺乏这个明确的观念，所以劲头不足，计划保守，慢慢吞吞，进展迟缓。
    走群众喜欢的路
    血吸虫病防治工作大跃进除了鼓足干劲以外，还要采用多快好省的工作方法。
    过去医疗工作的特点是：摆出医院架子，蹬在城镇，等客上门，长期疗程。那时医院都设在城镇上，无论国家医院或联合诊所，都摆出大医院的架子；都设有病房病床和病人膳食，一套陈规旧习；特别是长程疗法和休养时间至少要三十天，影响生产，花费很大。如嘉兴血吸虫病防治医院设二百多病床，三百多个医务行政人员，每个病人一进院就得先花三十元的住院费（不包括医药费），一年只能治二千多个病人。新丰乡联合诊所也按照这一套旧办法，住在镇上，1956年下半年八个医务人员治疗一百九十五个病人，花了四千多元，每个病人平均负担二十七元，农民很有意见。这是过去血吸虫病防治工作少慢差费的重大原因。
    今年在大跃进的形势下，医务人员的工作方法和思想作风也来了一个大翻身。目前的工作方法是：深入农村，送药上门，结合生产，短程疗法。现在普遍采用深入农村，就地设院，一组多点，巡回治疗的方法；一般都用二、三日疗法，共需六、七天，就可以恢复劳动，时间短，花费少，群众鼓掌欢迎。嘉善天凝乡王苏台血吸虫病防治小组，四个医务人员，还培养了社的两个保健员，有一期（六天）收了一百九十七个病人，按自然村分六个点（小病房）以及十九户送药上门；他们以民房庙宇当病房，门板作病床，自带被服伙食；他们运用二日疗法，六日出院，病人负担只有一点八元。他（她）们也想出了很多办法，克服困难，在处理急病时，采用各点白日插红旗，夜间挂红灯的信号联络的办法；护士量体温和注射的速度很快，超过了过去的规定，从未发生医疗事故。医生在大雪天滚在河里，不回来换衣服，还坚持去治疗病人，护士们挑水、烧饭，什么也干。不论大雪大雨，他（她）们深夜到各村轮流工作，他（她）们坚持三十九个昼夜，群众很受感动。
    目前由于打破了陈规旧习，医生下乡治病，坚持先进疗法，真正为生产服务，因此才能出现一个热热闹闹，多快好省，群众拥护的新局面。
    正因为采用了多快好省的方法，干部也欢迎，农民也喜欢。时间上，过去三十天，现在只要五、六天；经费上，从前看病几十元，现在只要两块钱；质量上，又是同样的效果。
    掌握时机，争取全胜
    事实证明，一切工作有了跃进的指导思想，才能产生多快好省的工作方针；少慢差费正是缺乏大跃进的干劲。党中央和毛主席指出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省”的方针正是完整的社会主义建设工作的胜利方针，是群众创造领导集中的方针，是在经济建设上赛过资本主义世界的方针，是唯物论辩证法的马克思列宁主义的方针，是照耀着一切工作跃进的灯塔，我们将决心把这条胜利的方针，贯彻到一切工作中去，加速社会主义的建设。
    农业大跃进是需要解决水利、肥料、技术、工具等许多因素凑成的，但实现这些因素的还是人，人是社会主义的宝中之宝。在农业大跃进的今天，劳力经常感到缺乏和不足，解决这个问题的办法，当前除改良农具、改进管理，更重要的还必须根治病人。农业劳动生产率的提高除了机械化以外，解除疾病是不可缺少的因素。当前的生产大跃进必须结合血吸虫病防治工作的大跃进。
    我们全区还有近七十万人患有血吸虫病，如果按照4月份的一个月治疗十万多病人的速度，那么，今年10月份就可以完成治疗任务。4月份的治疗速度并无特殊因素，相反这是在日夜积肥、翻耕插秧，劳动非常紧张的条件下进行的，那么，在农闲的时候，治疗的人数还能更多，因此，我们已下决心结合农业季节，紧密安排，争取在今年基本上消灭血吸虫病，明年再搞部分复发病人的复诊工作。在今年的秋冬结合水利、积肥运动，消灭钉螺，以后反复的复查，根绝钉螺，同时结合积肥和卫生运动继续集中粪便管理。力求今年基本完成血吸虫病防治工作的任务。只有在加紧实现农业跃进各种措施的同时，提早消灭人民的主要疾病，才能加速实现全国农业发展纲要的光荣任务。
