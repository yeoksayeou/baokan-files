Willing to Share Excellent Seeds with Brother Provinces
Heilongjiang Extensively Builds Rice, Potato, Corn, and Soybean Seed Bases

    This newspaper reports that Heilongjiang Province is establishing seed bases for rice, potatoes, corn, and soybeans. All of the province's one hundred-plus local state-run demonstration farms have been converted into seed propagation farms this year. At the same time, every commune has seed plots, and every county has fine seed farms. According to statistics up to mid-April, over six thousand communes in the province, accounting for 84% of the total number of agricultural communes, have established seed plots.

    Heilongjiang Province is establishing seed bases to meet the needs of another leap forward in production next year and to supply brother provinces to achieve the "four, five, eight" targets ahead of schedule. The four types of seeds that Heilongjiang seed bases will propagate—rice, potatoes, corn, and soybeans—are high-yield crops, and soybeans are an industrial raw material with significant economic value. The rice varieties in Heilongjiang Province mature in about 110 days. When planted in the south of the Yangtze River, where there is shorter daylight and higher temperatures, their maturity period is only 70 to 80 days. Meanwhile, the yield is no lower than that of local varieties, and the rice quality is good, thus bringing favorable conditions for these areas to develop double-cropping and triple-cropping rice systems. This year, Heilongjiang Province's rice acreage has expanded from 254,000 hectares last year to 400,000 hectares, and next year it will be developed to 1 million hectares, requiring a large amount of rice seeds. In addition, various regions in the south also urgently hope that Heilongjiang Province will supply more rice seeds.

    Developing tuber crops is an important way to increase grain production, and Heilongjiang Province's potatoes are large and high-yielding, with the highest yield reaching over 5,300 catties per mu. When planted south of the Great Wall, the yield is one to seven times higher than that of local potatoes. This year, 15 provinces and cities, including Guangdong and Jilin, have signed contracts with Heilongjiang Province, requesting a supply of 250 million catties of potato seeds next year.

    Heilongjiang soybeans, with their high oil yield, have also begun to be planted in some provinces north of the Great Wall and are very popular among farmers.

    In order to ensure the supply of seeds for both within and outside the province next year, the Provincial People's Committee has already reserved 33 counties with good potato seed quality, such as Keshan and Nehe, 25 counties with a long history of rice planting, such as Ning'an and Wuchang, and 27 counties with relatively good corn and soybean planting as seed bases. These seeds will be cultivated and propagated through agricultural cooperatives, and seeds will be provided to the state after the autumn harvest. (Ma Xinren)

    愿与兄弟省共有优良种子
    黑龙江普建水稻土豆玉米大豆种子基地
    本报讯　黑龙江省正在建立水稻、土豆、玉米、大豆的种子基地。全省一百多个地方国营示范农场，今年全部改为种子繁殖场；同时，社社有种子地，县县有良种场。到4月中旬统计，全省已有六千多个社，占农业社总社数的84％建立了种子地。
    黑龙江省建立种子基地是为了明年生产再跃进的需要，和供应兄弟省份提前实现“四、五、八”的要求。黑龙江种子基地要繁殖的四种种子——水稻、土豆、玉米是高产作物，大豆是经济价值很大的工业原料。黑龙江省的水稻品种，成熟期在一百一十天左右，种在日照短气温高的长江南北，它的成熟期只要七十几天到八十几天，同时产量不低于当地品种，稻米质量又好，因此就给这些地区带来了发展双季稻、三季稻的有利条件。今年黑龙江省水稻面积由去年的二十五万四千公顷扩大到四十万公顷，明年要发展到一百万公顷，需要稻种很多。另外，南方各地也迫切希望黑龙江省更多地供应水稻种子。
    发展薯类是增产粮食的重要途径，而黑龙江省的土豆个大、产量高，每亩最高产量曾达五千三百多斤。在长城以南种植，则比当地土豆增产一倍到七倍。今年已有广东、吉林等十五省（市）和黑龙江省订了合同，要求明年供应两亿五千万斤土豆种。
    出油率高的黑龙江大豆，也开始在长城以内一些省份种植，很受农民欢迎。
    为了保证明年省内外种子供应，省人民委员会已预约土豆种质量好的克山、讷河等三十三个县，种植水稻多历史又长的宁安、五常等二十五个县，玉米、大豆种植比较好的二十七个县为种子基地，通过农业社培育繁殖，秋后向国家提供种子。　　　（马新仁）
