　　The Copyright Page of a Book
  　Anniversary

    The copyright page, like a person's resume card, helps people understand information about the book's publication and other details.

    "Format" describes the size of a book. The most common format is 32mo, which means cutting a full-size sheet of paper into thirty-two sheets. The original large paper sizes vary, but the commonly used ones are 787 cm wide and 1092 cm long, and 787 cm wide and 1168 cm long. Therefore, if the reader sees "787×1092 1/32," they know that the book is made by cutting a 787 cm wide and 1092 cm long sheet of paper into thirty-two sheets.

    "Printer's sheet" indicates how many sheets of paper are required for the book. It is a publishing term, with every two printer's sheets equaling one full-size sheet of paper. If the reader sees 9 1/2 printer's sheets on the copyright page, it indicates that the book requires nine and a half printer's sheets, which is 4 3/4 full-size sheets of paper.

    The number of words recorded on the copyright page is not the actual number of words in the book. For example, if a book has twenty-six lines per page and twenty-seven words per line, then one page has seven hundred and two words. Regardless of the size of the title or whether there are blank lines, it is still counted as seven hundred and two words.

    There are two items related to the edition record. One is × year × month × edition; the other is × year × month × printing. All newly published books for the first time are written as "First Edition" and "First Printing." When the book is sold out and needs to be reprinted, if there are no major changes and no need to re-typeset, it can still be written as "First Edition," only specifying "Second Printing" in the second item.

    "Print run" is generally written as 1—×× copies. If it is a reprinted book, it will be written as "Previous print run" to "Current print run plus previous print run." For example, if the previous print run was 30,000 copies and the current reprint is 20,000 copies, it will be written as 30,000 to 50,000.

    The unified book number is a record of the book's category, sequence number, and publisher code. Some book numbers also have the letters "T" or "R" in front of them. "T" indicates popular reading material, and "R" indicates children's reading material.

    There is a () in front of the price, and there is a number inside the (). It indicates which category of books the book is priced according to. China has unified regulations for book pricing. In order to take care of both the publisher and the reader, the publishing administrative department prices various types of books according to different standards. For example, textbooks are priced the lowest, and science and technology books are priced higher due to typesetting. The smaller the number inside the (), the lower the price. Generally, middle school textbooks have (2) in front of the price, while science and technology books have (9). Understanding this, there is no need to be surprised by two books of the same thickness having significantly different prices.

    版权页像一个人的简历卡片一样，帮助人们去了解有关这本书的出版等情况。
    “开本”是说明一本书的大小的。一般常见的开本是三十二开，就是将一张原大的纸，裁成三十二张纸。原大的纸尺寸不一样，目前通用的有七百八十七公分宽、一千零九十二公分长，和七百八十七公分宽、一千一百六十八公分长的两种。因此，如果读者看到787×10921／32字样，就知道这本书是用七百八十七公分宽、一千零九十二公分长的纸裁成三十二张的。
    “印张”说明本书需用多少张纸，是出版界术语，每二印张等于一张原大纸。如果读者看到版权页上印有91／2印张，就表明本书需用九个半印张，即43／4张原大纸。
    版权页上记载的字数，并不是该书的实际字数。例如一本书每面有二十六行，每行二十七字，那么一面是七百零二字。不管标题多大，有无空行，都算七百零二字。
    关于版次记载共有两项。一项是×年×月第×版；另一项是×年×月第×次印刷。凡是头一次出版的新书，都写“第一版”和“第一次印刷”。书卖完了，要再印时，如果没有大改，不需重排，一直可写“第一版”，只在第二项中写明“第二次印刷”。
    “印数”一般都写上1—××册。如果是重印的书，就写上“上次的印数”至“本次印数加上次印数”。例如上次印了三万册，本次重印二万册，就写上三万至五万。
    统一书号是关于本书类别、序号以及出版社代号的记载。有些书号前还写上T或R字样，T表示通俗读物，R表示儿童读物。
    定价前面有一个（），（）内有一个数码。它表示本书是按哪类书籍定价的。我国书籍定价有统一规定，出版行政部门为了既照顾出版社又照顾读者，把各类书籍按不同标准定价。例如教科书定价最低，科技书因排印关系，定价较高。（）内数字越小，定价就低。一般中学教科书定价前都写上（2），而科技书则写上（9）。了解这点，对于两本同样厚薄而定价相差较大的书籍，就不必大惊小怪了。
