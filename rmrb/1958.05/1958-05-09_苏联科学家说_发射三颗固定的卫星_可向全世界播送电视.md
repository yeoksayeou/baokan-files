Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 8th, TASS dispatch: Varvarov, Director of the Cosmonautics Department of the USSR Volunteer Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy and Air Force, said that artificial Earth satellites can solve the problem of sending television broadcasts worldwide.

Varvarov pointed out that to ensure worldwide television broadcasting, it is only necessary to launch three fixed satellites at an altitude of 35,800 kilometers. The orbits of these satellites are all on the equatorial plane, orbiting the Earth once in a day along the orbit, that is, the angular velocity of their operation is equal to the angular velocity of the Earth's rotation. The distance between the satellites is equivalent to eight hours of travel. In this case, the three satellites are like being “suspended” above three regions of the Earth’s surface forever.

He said that these satellites should be equipped with television receiving and transmitting devices with a wide band. Using special receiving and transmitting antennas with automatic tracking devices, the satellites can always maintain contact with certain television broadcasting centers on Earth. Each satellite will receive radio signals from the Earth, amplify them, and it can relay these signals to neighboring satellites for relaying to other regions of the Earth, so that television can be broadcast to the world.

    苏联科学家说
    发射三颗固定的卫星  可向全世界播送电视
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会宇宙飞行部主任瓦尔瓦罗夫说，利用人造地球卫星可以解决向全世界发送电视广播的问题。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫指出，为了保证全世界的电视广播，只要向三万五千八百公里高空发射三个固定的卫星就可以了。这些卫星的轨道都在赤道平面上，沿着轨道在一昼夜围绕地球运行一周，也就是说，其运行的角速度等于地球自转的角速度。卫星彼此间的距离相当八小时的路程。在这种情况下，三个卫星就好像永远分别“悬”在地球表面三个地区之上。
    他说，在这些卫星上都应当装备波段很宽的电视接受和发射装置。利用带有自动跟踪装置的专门的接收和发射天线，卫星就可以经常同地球上一定的电视发射中心保持联系。每个卫星都将接受地球上发出的无线电讯号，加以放大，它可以把这些讯号转播给邻近卫星以便向地球其他地区转播，这样就可以把电视播送到全世界。
