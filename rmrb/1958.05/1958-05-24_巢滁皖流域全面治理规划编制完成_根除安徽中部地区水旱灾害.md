Comprehensive Treatment Plan for the Chao-Chu-Wan River Basin Completed
Eradicating Flood and Drought Disasters in Central Anhui

    (Our report) The ambitious plan for the comprehensive treatment and utilization of the Chao (Lake) - Chu (River) - Wan (River) basin, with the central task of controlling flood and drought disasters in central Anhui, has recently been completed. Currently, relevant departments are carrying out the design, and some projects can be started this year.

    In the central Anhui area, north of the Yangtze River and south of the Huai River, excluding the Huai River basin, there are five major water systems including Chao Lake, Chu River, Wan River, Caizi Lake, and Chenyao Lake, collectively known as the Chao-Chu-Wan River basin. The basin area reaches more than 34,000 square kilometers, with 19 million mu of cultivated land, including 23 counties and cities in central Anhui and Jiangpu and Liuhe counties in Jiangsu, and parts of the suburbs of Nanjing. Before liberation, due to the long-term disrepair of rivers and poor irrigation facilities, alternating drought and flood or simultaneous drought and flood became a historical norm in this area. According to statistics from the past 300 years, the Chao Lake basin has experienced 66 major floods, the Wan River basin has experienced 53 floods of various sizes, and the hilly areas have experienced 61 major droughts, and the losses suffered by farmers are incalculable. Based on this situation, the plan determines that the central task is to eliminate flood and drought disasters, while developing hydropower, improving navigation, and conserving water and soil.

    In terms of eliminating floods, flood control measures include constructing the Yuxikou Sluice and Ship Lock and the Longhekou Comprehensive Utilization Reservoir on Chao Lake; constructing the Pukou Sluice and Ship Lock on the Chu River, building flood control reservoirs on the main stream, and constructing the Dama Factory, Huanglishu, and Xiayingzi three comprehensive utilization reservoirs on the tributaries; constructing the Hualiangting and Shuihouling two comprehensive utilization reservoirs on the Wan River, and opening up the Jiangjiazui New River in the lower reaches; constructing the Xiaogangyao Sluice on Caizi Lake; after dredging, repairing, and managing other rivers, general embankments can withstand floods that occur once every 50 to 100 years, and important embankments can withstand floods that occur once every 100 to 300 years. The measures for eliminating waterlogging are to carry out water storage and artificial drainage projects in separate areas, expand the drainage capacity of ponds and ditches, and build pumping stations for drainage and irrigation in the areas along the river. In this way, the embankments will not be flooded even if there is continuous rainfall of 300 to 400 mm in five to ten days (in the past, flooding would occur with continuous rainfall of 100 to 150 mm). In terms of eliminating drought, the main measures are to build reservoirs and ponds, and try to use surface runoff as much as possible, and to pump water from the Yangtze River and Chao Lake for irrigation. In this way, the hilly areas, which used to suffer from drought after 20 to 30 days without rain, can now ensure a good harvest even if there is no rain for 50 to 70 days. In terms of hydropower development, after more than ten large and medium-sized hydropower stations are built according to the plan, approximately 500 million kilowatt-hours of cheap electrical energy can be generated each year. After improving the navigation channels, Chao Lake to the Yangtze River can be navigable all year round. In terms of reclamation, the cultivated land area can be expanded by 500,000 mu. The plan also proposes detailed measures for water and soil conservation in the Dabie Mountains and other low mountains and hilly areas within the basin.

### 巢滁皖流域全面治理规划编制完成  根除安徽中部地区水旱灾害

    巢滁皖流域全面治理规划编制完成
    根除安徽中部地区水旱灾害
    本报讯　以制服安徽中部地区水旱灾害为中心的巢（湖）滁（河）皖（河）流域全面治理、综合利用的宏伟规划，最近已经编制完成。目前，有关部门正进行设计，部分工程可在今年开工。
    在长江以北淮河以南的皖中地区，除淮河流域外，有巢湖、滁河、皖河、菜子湖、陈瑶湖等五大水系，泛称巢滁皖流域。流域面积达三万四千多平方公里，耕地有一千九百万亩，包括皖中二十三个县市和江苏江浦、六合两县、南京市的部分郊区。解放以前，由于河流年久失修，灌溉设施不善，此旱彼涝或旱涝互见成了这一地区的历史惯象。据近三百年的统计，巢湖流域曾发生大水灾六十六次，皖河流域曾发生大小水灾五十三次，丘陵地区曾发生较大旱灾六十一次，农民遭受的损失，无法计算。根据这一情况，规划确定以消灭水旱灾害为中心任务，同时开发水能、改善航运、保持水土。
    在消灭水灾方面，防洪的措施是在巢湖修建裕溪口水闸、船闸和龙河口综合利用水库；滁河修建浦口水闸、船闸，干流修建防洪水库，支流修建大马厂、黄栗树、下营子三个综合利用水库；皖河修建花凉亭、水吼岭两个综合利用水库，下游开辟江家咀新河；菜子湖修建小缸窑水闸；其他河流，进行河道疏浚、培修、治理以后，一般堤防可以抵御五十年至一百年一遇的洪水，重要堤防可以抵御一百年至三百年一遇的洪水。除涝的措施是做分片蓄水、人工排水工程，扩大塘沟排水能力，在沿江圩区增建抽水机排灌站，这样，圩区在五天至十天内连降三百至四百公厘雨的情况下，可以不发生涝灾（过去连降一百至一百五十公厘雨就要发生涝灾）。在消灭旱灾方面，主要的措施一是兴建水库、塘坝，尽量利用地面径流，二是抽长江水和巢湖水进行灌溉，这样，原来二十天至三十天不雨即要发生旱灾的丘陵地区，今后在五十天至七十天不雨的情况下可保丰收。在水能开发方面，按规划建成大中型水电站十余个后，每年可以发出约五亿度廉价电能。改善航道后，巢湖到长江可以终年通航。在围垦方面，可以扩大耕地面积五十万亩。对于流域内大别山区和其它低山、丘陵区的水土保持工作，规划中也提出了详尽的措施。
