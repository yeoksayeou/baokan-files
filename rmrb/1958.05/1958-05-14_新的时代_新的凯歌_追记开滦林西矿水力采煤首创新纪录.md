　　A New Era, A New Triumph
　　——In Memory of Kailuan Linxi Mine's Water-Powered Coal Mining Setting a New Record
    Wang Lin
    If the Soviet Union's use of hydraulic coal mining in 1939 opened a new era in the history of human coal mining, then the Kailuan Linxi Mine's hydraulic coal mining area sang the most resounding triumph on March 27, 1958, when it first promoted this advanced work method in China. On this day, the Linxi Mine's hydraulic coal mining area had a team of thirty workers produce 632 tons of raw coal, with a full-member production efficiency of 21.07 tons. This was a 40% increase over the original Great Leap Forward plan, setting a new record for hydraulic coal mining in China. The full-member production efficiency on this day was more than nineteen times higher than that of the Kailuan Mine under the plunder of British imperialists before liberation, and also five to seven times higher compared to coal mining combines and coal cutting machines after liberation. From a direct cost perspective, the hydraulic coal mining area's cost on March 27th was 56 cents per ton, only one-fifth to one-quarter of that of coal mining combines and coal cutting machines.
    In most people's minds, deep-well coal mining is easily associated with a series of disasters: methane (explosive gas) combustion, coal dust explosions, rock collapses...; and mentioning coal miners, it is difficult to separate them from coal dust, fatigue, and disabilities. The hydraulic coal mining method can send these pains and disasters to historical museums. Coal dust can be completely eliminated. Explosive gas also greatly reduces its outflow when it encounters water. Water cannons can quickly dislodge coal, and the range of the water jets can reach thirteen meters, so even if there is a rock collapse, it will not harm the coal miners. Not to mention the substantial reduction in workers' physical labor. Because there is no coal dust flying on the coal mining face, it not only makes the workers feel happy during labor, but also has good consequences for the workers' physical health.
    The happiness of a socialist society is built on the continuous growth of social productive forces, and even more so on caring for people. In early 1956, the Ministry of Coal Industry sent a working group to the Soviet Union and Poland to learn about this advanced experience. The Tangshan Coal Science Research Institute and the Kailuan Mining General Administration began technical design in August 1956. The Kailuan Machinery Manufacturing and Repair Factory manufactured all the necessary mechanical equipment. The Kailuan Mechanical and Electrical Installation Department then completed the processing and installation of the equipment, so it officially began industrial testing on June 16, 1957. Before the Great Leap Forward, the highest daily output was 447 tons, and the full-member efficiency was 10.4 tons. On March 19th, the Kailuan No. 5 Mine held a Great Leap Forward oath-taking rally. Representatives from the hydraulic coal mining area presented a letter of challenge at the rally, guaranteeing to increase the full-member efficiency to 15 tons and strive for 20 tons. On March 27th, they created an even higher new record.
    Hydraulic coal mining has a simple production process, high labor productivity, low cost, fast coal extraction, and is safe. However, its implementation at the Linxi Mine was not smooth sailing. Its development process also went through struggles between the advanced and the conservative, and between difficulties and overcoming them. Every step forward requires the enthusiasm and wisdom of the working class to promote it.
    When the hydraulic coal mining method from the Soviet Union and Poland was introduced in the operating procedures study class in May 1957, even party members and key personnel lacked confidence: "It's hard enough to complete the task with coal combines, what about using water to flush it? That's too mysterious!" Listening to the class was like listening to a mythical legend. When they went to the site for practice in mid-June and used the water cannon, they thought "Humph, it works!" Only then did they believe it. But when they returned home, people thought: "This is on the coal skin. The coal skin is loose, so it's easy to flush. On the coal face, it's not loose, so it might not work!" The next day, they flushed the coal face, randomly shooting around with the water cannon as if it was fun. They were able to flush the coal face, but not much coal was dislodged. People's minds fluctuated again: "What new technology is this? It's not as fast as using a hand pick!" The district chief and the branch secretary discovered this wavering mood and immediately convened a meeting of party members and key personnel to solve the ideological problem. After improving political mood and sense of responsibility, the water cannon operators thought of their past experience of using hand picks to dislodge coal when operating, first finding soft places to dislodge the coal. When a groove was dug in a soft place, the coal in the hard place would loosen. So they promoted this method, which doubled the amount of coal mined.
    But new problems emerged: the mining face did not use supports, and rocks sometimes collapsed, pressing down on the coal. In order not to lose coal, the workers came up with new ideas again. At a technical research meeting, Zhang Shujun, the deputy water cannon operator, proposed the method of opening small doors and digging large holes. Everyone tried it, and this method indeed prevented the collapse of rocks. Then, Li Guangyin, the water cannon operator, suggested using hydraulic power to open eye-shaped canopies, which was even safer. Zhang Shujun suggested using one less large board and two less pillars to maintain the water cannon, improving the method of backfilling.
    It was trialed in medium-thick coal seams during the trial period and only switched to thick coal seams on March 16th this year. With the different coal quality, new difficulties emerged: gangue slid down from the goaf. Driver Li Guangyin created a method of retaining coal walls, blocking the gangue from sliding down. Also, because the coal seam had great toughness, and there was soft coal on top, it was not easy to flush down with a water cannon after digging a groove. On March 21st, the district chief and branch secretary convened a meeting to study these problems, proposing to change the production organization from three shifts to four shifts. The first and third shifts cross-worked with the second and fourth shifts to do production and preparation work. After digging the groove, the coal seam would be subjected to pressure and destruction for a period of time. By doing this, the stubborn coal seam was indeed easily flushed down.
    The coal dislodging work suddenly improved, but the screening machine could not keep up. Ming Guiyou, the deputy water cannon operator and party member, suggested installing a fixed screen, which solved the problem. On March 25th, the fixed screen was installed, and the full-member efficiency exceeded fifteen tons that day. On March 27th, the new record of 21.07 tons of full-member efficiency was achieved.
    March 27th was an extraordinary day. When Li Ruilin, the non-full-time district trade union chairman and water cannon operator, went on the noon shift at 2 PM, Deputy Chief Engineer Dai Guoquan reminded Li Ruilin: "You haven't completed the task of twenty tons on the 26th!" Li Ruilin disagreed and said: "It's not that we didn't complete the coal dislodging task, it's that transportation couldn't keep up!" Engineer Dai Guoquan said: "How about I personally take charge of scheduling vehicles today and give it a try? As long as you have coal, I guarantee there will be vehicles!" Li Ruilin accepted the challenge and said: "If you guarantee vehicles, I guarantee coal!" Engineer Dai said: "Okay, let's set that condition!" Li Ruilin thought that Engineer Dai was just cheering them on, and then asked him: "Are you willing to sacrifice your time and work with us on the Great Leap Forward?" Engineer Dai explicitly expressed his determination, saying: "I will stick it out until 1 AM at night, I will definitely not get off work!" "What will you eat? You didn't bring any dry food." "Are you having a Great Leap Forward, and I'm not? I have to have a Great Leap Forward even if I'm hungry!" The workers on the side cheered in support and said: "As long as you work with us on the Great Leap Forward, we can all eat a little less and won't let you go hungry!" The emotions of both sides rose even higher. Li Ruilin announced the conditions of the challenge with Engineer Dai to all the workers in the coal mining team and the tunneling team, and the workers' enthusiasm was even higher. The mine leaders had already been "frequently beating the drums of war to urge them to battle" everywhere. Upon hearing Engineer Dai's report, Chen Changshuan, the deputy mine manager in charge of production, personally sat in the dispatch room to direct the overall battle. Thus, a battle of the Great Leap Forward in production began.
    Comrades, in the era of resisting America and aiding Korea, have you seen heroic volunteers use tunnels to attack the enemy? When fighting guerrillas in the mountains, haven't you seen mountain torrents erupt when the storm comes? After entering the big city, haven't you also seen the fire brigade put out the flames? At the meetings to welcome international friends, haven't you also appreciated the foreign symphony orchestra? Comrades, in the storm of the hydraulic coal mining Great Leap Forward, you will see and hear all those moving scenes and sounds all at once. Comrades, do you want to listen to a symphony of the socialist Great Leap Forward? Comrades, do you want to see how the heroes on the production front apply the revolutionary heroism of the People's Liberation Army and the Volunteers to the mine? Come and take a look! The water arrows shot by the water cannons are like the flashing trajectories of the Katyusha rockets. The plated lamps on the willow pot hats are like the searchlights of the anti-aircraft artillery team monitoring enemy aircraft. The coal blocks washed down by the water cannons are like the rolling logs and stones on the ancient battlefield. The torrents in the iron chutes and the echoes in the tunnels cannot but remind you of mountain torrents. The lifting and lowering of the vertical shaft winch, the speeding of the underground tram, the roar of the wind fan, plus the cheers of the workers in the competition, are truly ten thousand thunders, using strength and enthusiasm to play the marching song of the socialist production Great Leap Forward.

　　新的时代  新的凯歌
　　——追记开滦林西矿水力采煤首创新纪录
    王林
    如果说苏联1939年用水力采煤在人类采煤史上开创了一个新时代，那么，开滦林西矿水力采煤区在中国推行这一个先进工作法上1958年3月27日首先唱出了最嘹亮的凯歌。在这一天，林西矿水力采煤区到班三十人，日产原煤六百三十二吨，全员生产效率达到二十一点零七吨。比原跃进计划提高40％，在中国首创水力采煤的新纪录。这一天的全员生产效率比解放前英帝国主义者掠夺下的开滦矿提高十九倍多，跟解放以后的采煤联合机和割煤机比较起来，也提高五倍到七倍。从直接成本上看，水力采煤区3月27日是每吨五角六分，只有采煤联合机和割煤机的五分之一到四分之一。
    在一般人的印象里，深井采煤，就很容易地跟一连串的灾难联系到一起：沼气（爆炸性瓦斯）燃烧，煤尘爆炸，岩石塌落……；提到采煤工人，就很难和煤尘、疲劳、残疾分家。水力采煤法就能把这些痛苦和灾难送进历史博物馆里去。煤尘可以完全消灭。爆炸性瓦斯遇见水也要大大减少涌出量。水枪落煤快，水头射程又可以达到十三公尺，岩石即使有塌陷也损伤不到采煤工人。更不用说大量减少了工人的体力劳动。采煤面上因为没有煤尘飞扬，不仅只使工人在劳动时精神愉快，而且对工人的身体健康有良好的后果。
    社会主义社会的幸福，建筑在社会生产力的不断增长上，而更关心的是人。煤炭工业部1956年初派工作团到苏联和波兰学习了这一种先进经验，唐山煤炭科学研究院和开滦矿总管理处在1956年8月就开始了技术设计。开滦机械制修厂制造了所需要的一切机械设备。开滦机电安装处接着完成了设备的加工和安装工作，因而在1957年6月16日就正式开始了工业性试验。大跃进以前，最高日产量是四百四十七吨，全员效率为十点四吨。3月19日开滦五矿开跃进誓师大会，大会上水力采煤区出席代表提出挑战书，保证全员效率提高到十五吨，争取二十吨。3月27日就创造了更高的新纪录。
    水力采煤法，生产过程单一、劳动生产率高、成本低、出煤快又安全，但是它在林西矿上的推行过程，也不是一帆风顺的。他的发展过程也是通过了先进与保守、困难与克服困难的斗争的。它的每一步前进，都要用工人阶级的热情和智慧来推动。
    1957年5月开作业规程学习班介绍苏联和波兰的水力采煤法的时候，即便是党团员和骨干也没有信心：“用康拜因机突击，还不好完成任务呢，用水冲？那太神秘啦！”听课像听讲神话传奇。6月中到现场实习，用水枪一打，“哼，行！”这才相信。可是回到家里，人们又想：“这是在煤皮。煤皮压松了，好冲。采面上，没有压松，就不一定行啦！”第二天冲采面，好玩似地用水枪乱冲一气。能够冲动采面，可是落煤不多。人们心里又波动起来：“还新技术呢，不如用手镐快！”区长、支部书记发现了这种动摇情绪，立刻召集党团员和骨干开会，解决思想问题。政治情绪和责任心提高以后，水枪司机们在操作时想起过去用手镐落煤的经验，先找软的地方落煤。软处掏开一道槽，硬处的煤就松了。于是推行这种方法，使采煤量多出了一倍。
    但是又出新问题了：回采面不用支架，岩石有时陷落下来，把煤压住。为了不丢煤，工人们又动起脑筋来。在技术研究会上，水枪副司机张树钧提出开小门、掏大洞的办法。大伙一试，这办法果然可以防止岩石的塌落。接着，李光印水枪司机又建议用水力开采眼棚子，更为安全。张树钧建议少用一块维护水枪的大板、二棵柱子，改进了回柱的方法。
    试办时期在中厚煤层，今年3月16日才转入厚煤层使用。煤质不同，又出了新的困难：从采空区往下溜?子。李光印司机创造了留煤壁的办法，挡住了?子下溜。又因为煤层韧性大，上边并且有软煤，掏槽以后用水枪打也不容易冲下来。3月21日区长和支书召开会议研究这些问题，提出改变生产组织，由三班改为四班。一、三班为二、四班交叉做生产与准备工作。掏槽以后，使煤层经过一段时间的受压与破坏。这样一做，顽固的煤层，果然很容易地被冲落下来了。
    落煤工作骤然提高，但是筛机吃不开。水枪副司机、党员明贵友建议安装固定筛以后才解决了这个难题。3月25日安上固定筛，当天就突破十五吨的全员效率。3月27日就达到了全员效率二十一点零七吨的新纪录。
    3月27日是个不平凡的日子。不脱产的区工会主席、水枪司机李瑞林上中午二时班的时候，副总工程师戴国权提醒李瑞林说：“26日可是还没有完成二十吨的任务！”李瑞林不服气地说：“不是我们落煤没有完成任务，是运输赶不上！”戴国权工程师说：“我今天亲自负责调度车辆试一试怎么样？你们只要有煤，我就保证有车辆！”李瑞林应战说：“你保证有车，我就保证有煤！”戴工程师说：“好，就订这个条件！”李瑞林以为戴工程师仅只是打气，接着问他：“你肯牺牲时间跟我们大跃进吗？”戴工程师明确地表示决心说：“一直顶到夜间一点，我决不下班！”“你吃什么，你又没有带着干粮下来。”“你们大跃进，我就不大跃进吗？饿着肚子也得大跃进！”在旁边的工人们就欢呼着支援说：“只要你跟我们一块儿大跃进，每人少吃一点也不能叫你挨饿！”双方的情绪更是高涨起来。李瑞林向采煤组和掘进组的全体工人宣布了和戴工程师挑战的条件，工人们的干劲更高了。矿领导方面早就在到处“频敲战鼓催上阵”，听到戴工程师的报告，立刻由生产副矿长陈长拴亲自坐阵调度室指挥全面战斗。于是一场生产大跃进的战役就这样开始了。
    同志，在抗美援朝的年代，你见过英雄的志愿军利用坑道冲击敌人吗？在山沟里打游击，当暴风雨来临的时候，你不是看见过山洪暴发吗？进入大都市以后，你不是又见过消防队扑灭火焰吗？在欢迎国际友人的会上，你不是也欣赏过友邦的大管弦乐队吗？同志，在水力采煤大跃进的暴风雨里，你会一下子都看到、都听到那些动人的场面和音响。同志，你想听一曲社会主义大跃进的交响乐吗？同志，你想看一看生产战线上的英雄们，怎样把解放军、志愿军的革命英雄主义运用到矿井里吗？来看一看吧！水枪射出的水箭，像喀秋莎大炮一闪一闪的弹道。柳罐斗帽上的镀灯，像高射炮队监视敌人飞机的探照灯。被水枪冲击下来的煤块，像古代战场上的滚木擂石。铁溜槽里的激流和巷道里的回声，使你不能不联想到山洪暴发。竖井绞车的升降，地下电车的飞驰，煽风车的吼叫，再加上工人在竞赛中的欢呼，真是万响雷鸣，用力量和热情奏出了社会主义生产大跃进的进军曲。
