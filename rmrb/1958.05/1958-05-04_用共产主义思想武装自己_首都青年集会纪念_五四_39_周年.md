Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd—The capital's gathering commemorating the 39th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Youth Day was held today at the Beijing Gymnasium. More than 8,000 people attended the commemoration.

    Wang Zhaohua, First Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, delivered a report at the meeting. Wang Zhaohua said: The tasks put forward by the "May Fourth" Movement have been completed by our predecessors. In order to accomplish the great cause of socialist construction, the youth of the city must further carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, transform old ideas, break old rules, arm themselves with communist ideology, dare to think and dare to act, study diligently and practice hard, and truly become successors to the communist cause who are both red and expert.

    Young people from various fronts then reported on their leaps forward in ideology, production, and work. Representatives of young workers from the North China Radio Equipment Factory carried charts and beat gongs and drums to report good news to the meeting. They completed their production increase and thrift campaign eight days ahead of schedule, saving a large amount of funds for the country.

    Xiang Nan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. He said that the youth should inherit the revolutionary tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, continuously carry out ideological revolution, actively carry out technical revolution, and cultivate themselves into communist laborers who are fully imbued with collectivist spirit and possess modern cultural technology. Xiang Nan said that the youth should diligently and humbly learn from their older generation and thoroughly eliminate bourgeois individualism. Xiang Nan finally called on the broad masses of young people to combine revolutionary spirit with a pragmatic spirit and play a vanguard role in the technological revolution.

    用共产主义思想武装自己
    首都青年集会纪念“五四”39周年
    据新华社3日讯　首都纪念“五四”青年节三十九周年大会今天在北京体育馆举行。参加纪念大会的有八千多人。
    共青团北京市委第一书记王照华在会上作了报告。王照华说：“五四”运动提出的任务已由我们的前辈完成。为了完成社会主义建设的伟大事业，全市青年必须进一步发扬“五四”运动的革命传统，改造旧思想，打破旧规矩，用共产主义思想把自己武装起来，敢做敢想，勤学苦练，真正成为又红又专的共产主义接班人。
    各个战线上的青年接着分别报告了他们在思想、生产和工作上跃进的情形。华北无线电器材厂青年职工代表抬着图表、打着锣鼓向大会报喜。他们提前八天完成了增产节约任务，为国家节约了大批资金。
    共青团中央委员会书记处书记项南参加了大会，并讲了话。他说，青年们要继承“五四”的革命传统，不断进行思想革命，积极开展技术革命，把自己培养成全身浸透着集体主义精神、又有近代文化技术的共产主义的劳动者。项南说，青年们要刻苦地、虚心地向自己的老一辈学习，彻底清除掉资产阶级的个人主义思想。项南最后号召广大青年把革命气概同求实精神结合起来，在技术革命中起先锋作用。
