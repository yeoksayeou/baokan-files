    "Garbage Heiress"
    "Garbage Heiress" is a Hong Kong feature film. From it, we can see that the writers and directors intended to portray the coldness of Hong Kong society and expose the licentious lives of the upper class.

    The film cleverly unfolds the plot through the wandering lives of several garbage-picking orphans. At first, we might find it absurd that a wealthy family would forcibly recognize an orphan girl picking garbage on the street as their own daughter, but only when the film ends do we realize that the orphans were just dreaming on someone else's balcony.

    The exposure and reflection of the face of Hong Kong society is not profound enough, and some actors' pursuit of formalism in their performances are weaknesses of the film; but it is still a watchable film.

    “垃圾千金”
    “垃圾千金”是一部香港故事片。从中看得出来，编导者是想着意描绘香港社会的世态炎凉，揭露上层社会的荒淫生活的。
    影片通过几个拾垃圾的孤儿的流浪生活，巧妙地展开了剧情。起初我们会觉得一个大富人家硬把个在街头拾垃圾的孤女当作自家的千金，是件十分荒诞的事，等影片终结了，才知道原来是孤儿们睡在别人的凉台上做了一场梦。
    揭露和反映香港社会的面貌还不够深刻，有些演员在表演上的追求形式等，是这部影片的弱点；但它仍不失为一部可看的影片。
