    Ox-Drawn Seated Harrow
    Chen Daoyuan
    Recently, in Fenglai Cooperative, Hengfeng Township, Sandu Shui Autonomous County, Guizhou Province, a Shui ethnic group area, I worked with cooperative members to design and trial-produce an ox-drawn seated harrow. After experimentation and organizing visits, the local Shui farmers summarized three advantages:
    First, it reduces physical labor, is easy to operate, and is safe to use. Using old-fashioned harrows and foot-operated harrows to till the fields not only requires strenuous effort to hold and guide them, leaving you with a sore back and aching legs after a day's work, but also, if you are not careful, you can cut your feet on the harrow teeth. The ox-drawn seated harrow is very light and handy. When in use, the person sits on it, which is not only effortless, but also avoids foot injuries. Turning and transporting it are also very convenient.
    Second, the soil tilled by the ox-drawn seated harrow is deep, good, level, and fine. The five-and-a-half-inch long curved knife-shaped iron teeth can penetrate the soil to a depth of four to five inches, and can also chop up weeds and bury them under the harrowed mud. At the same time, because its harrow body is six feet wide, the person sitting on it can also control the center of gravity and adjust the depth.
    Third, the cost is low, it requires little labor, and it is easy to make. Each harrow only takes five workdays to make; apart from the iron harrow teeth (which require about six catties of raw iron), the rest of the components are all made of wood. Therefore, the cost of each harrow does not exceed seven yuan.

    牛拖座椅磨耙

    最近，我在贵州三都水族自治县水族聚居的恒丰乡丰来社，和社员们一起设计和试制了一种牛拖座椅磨耙。经过实验和组织参观，当地水族农民给它总结了三条好处：
    一、减轻人的体力劳动，操作轻便，使用安全。用老式磨耙和踩耙耙田，不仅需要使劲掌扶，一天累得腰酸腿疼，有时不小心，还会被耙齿划破脚。牛拖座椅磨耙很轻巧，使用时，人坐在上面，既不费力，又可避免划伤脚的事故，转弯搬运也很方便。
    二、用牛拖座椅磨耙耙的田土，又深又好又平又细。五寸五分长一个的弯刀形铁齿，能吃土四至五寸深，并且可以把杂草割碎压在耙碎的泥巴底下；同时，因为它的耙身有六尺宽，人坐在上面还可以掌握重心，调节深浅。
    三、成本低，花工少，容易做。这种耙每架只花五个工就可以做成；上面的工具除铁制耙齿（约需要六斤毛铁）外，其余全部用木制。因此，每架耙的工本费不超过七块钱。
