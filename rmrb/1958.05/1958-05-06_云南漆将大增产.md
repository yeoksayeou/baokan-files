    Yunnan Lacquer Production to Increase Greatly
    (By our reporter) Yunnan, famous for its lacquer production, will become the province with the highest lacquer output this year. The province's lacquer production can increase from 2,000 dan last year to 10,000 dan, becoming the province with the highest lacquer production in the country.
    This year, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu provinces sent a large number of technicians to Yunnan to support lacquer tapping, which has greatly improved the quality and increased the output.
