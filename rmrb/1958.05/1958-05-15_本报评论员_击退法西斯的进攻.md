    Repels the Fascist Offensive
    In Algiers, French colonial troops and extreme colonialists launched a military coup. A "Committee of Public Safety" controlled by army generals has been established. General Raoul Salan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army in Algeria, announced: "I am temporarily in control of the destiny of French Algeria."
    Indeed, the instigators of the coup attempt to control the fate of Algeria. However, their aim is by no means limited to this. They also attempt to control the fate of France—to establish fascist rule in France.
    The fact is clear that the coup in Algiers is a step in the French fascists' attempt to overthrow the republic. At the same time as the riots in Algiers, fascist thugs in France also rioted. Their slogans were the same, calling for de Gaulle to come to power and organize a military dictatorship.
    Recently, fascist activities in France have been rampant. Provocative incidents have been happening constantly. In mid-March, there was a demonstration in Paris by police against the parliamentary system. The coup in Algiers marks the fascists' determination to act on a large scale.
    The French working class and republicans are fully capable of repelling the fascists' rampant offensive. However, as the French Communist Party pointed out, the problem lies in strengthening united action. The current situation is that the unity of the French working class and republicans has been hindered due to the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party stubbornly adhering to an anti-communist attitude. This is one of the important reasons why fascists dare to take risks and stir up trouble.
    Now, defending the republican system has become the most urgent task of the French people. The Political Bureau of the French Communist Party has once again issued an appeal to the Socialist Party and all republican parties, calling for joint action to defend the republic. The "Socialist Party Left-Wing Trade Union" has also issued a statement calling on all democratic forces to unite and prevent the anti-republican conspiracy from spreading to France. This shows that in the face of the fascist threat, the demand for strengthening the unity of the working class is becoming more and more popular.
    It is believed that the French working class and democratic forces, with their glorious traditions, will give the fascists a heavy blow as they did in February 1936, and prevent the fascist conspiracy from succeeding.

    击退法西斯的进攻
    在阿尔及尔，法国的殖民军队和极端殖民主义分子发动了武力政变。一个在军队将领控制下的“救国委员会”已经建立起来了。法国驻阿尔及利亚陆军总司令拉乌尔·萨兰将军宣布：“我暂时掌握了法属阿尔及利亚的命运。”
    的确，政变的发动者企图掌握阿尔及利亚的命运。然而，他们的目的决不仅止于此。他们还企图掌握法国的命运——在法国建立法西斯的统治。
    事实很清楚，阿尔及尔的政变是法国法西斯企图推翻共和国制度活动的一个步骤。在阿尔及尔发生暴动的同时，法国国内的法西斯暴徒也进行了骚乱。他们的口号是相同的，要戴高乐上台，来组织一个军事独裁的政府。
    最近以来，在法国国内，法西斯分子的活动一直十分猖狂。挑衅事件不断发生。3月中旬在巴黎就发生过警察反对议会制度的示威。这次阿尔及尔的政变，标志着法西斯分子决心大规模地行动了。
    法国的工人阶级和共和人士完全有力量来击退法西斯的猖狂进攻。但是，正如法国共产党所指出的，问题在于加强一致行动。而目前的状况是，由于社会党右翼领袖顽固地坚持反共的态度，法国工人阶级的团结遭到了阻挠，共和人士的团结遭到了阻挠。法西斯分子之所以敢于冒险蠢动，这是重要的原因之一。
    现在，保卫共和国制度，已经成为法国人民最迫切的任务。法国共产党政治局已经又一次向社会党和一切共和党派发出呼吁，要求采取共同行动来保卫共和国。“社会党左翼工会”也发表声明，要求所有民主力量团结起来，不让反对共和国的阴谋扩大到法国来。这表明，在法西斯威胁面前，加强工人阶级团结的要求是越来越深入人心了。
    人们相信，有着光荣传统的法国工人阶级和民主力量，将会像1936年2月一样给法西斯分子以沉重的反击，不使法西斯的阴谋得逞。
