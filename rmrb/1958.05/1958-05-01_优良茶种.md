    我国种茶历史悠久，各地都有许多优良的茶树品种，其中最著名的有：
    云南大叶种——这个品种的特点是分枝疏，节间长，发芽能力强，单产高。我国著名红茶“滇红”，就是用这个品种制成的。
    祁门槠叶种——这是制造高级红茶“祁红”的优良品种。产量高，质量好，分枝多。
    大白茶——因茶芽上有许多洁白绒毛而得名。适制红茶、白茶。红茶为高级的“闽红”；白茶为“银针”、“白牡丹”。
    水仙种——用水仙种制成的乌龙茶，香气特别高，畅销东南亚。
    毛蟹种——嫩叶背面白毛多而长。制乌龙茶、红茶品质都好。
    铁观音——叶椭圆形，叶肉厚重，色浓绿，日光射能发银光。制成乌龙茶品质极佳。
