　　Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 14th: After a twenty-eight-day government crisis, People's Republican Movement leader Pierre Pflimlin formed the twenty-fifth French government since the war on May 13th. This government was formed under the grave situation created by French fascists.

　　With the French Communist Party not expressing opposition, Pflimlin was authorized by the National Assembly on May 13th with 274 votes against 129 to form the twenty-fifth French government since the war. The Communist parliamentary group issued a communique explaining the reason for abstaining from the vote, stating that because Pflimlin expressed his intention to continue the Algerian war, the Communists would not vote for him. However, because he stated that he would not yield to the anti-republican military coup, the Communist Party decided to abstain from the vote, allowing the new government to be formed. The communique solemnly declared that the Communist deputies "will do everything possible to establish an alliance of all anti-fascist forces in the country and in parliament."

　　After the parliament convened, Pflimlin first spoke, explaining the policy program of his government. He emphasized that his government's Algerian policy was: to seek peace with strength. Therefore, it must first strive to intensify the Algerian colonial war, and then choose the "most favorable moment" to begin negotiations for a ceasefire. He demanded that the French people make "new sacrifices" for this and stated that he would increase spending on the Algerian war. As a supplement to military action, he also demanded that the "Fundamental Law" of Algeria be more rigorously implemented. At the same time, he indicated that he did not intend to reject in advance the mediation of Tunisia and Morocco on the Algerian issue.

　　On the issue of the North Atlantic Alliance, he emphasized the importance of this military bloc for the so-called "security" of Europe on the one hand, and on the other hand complained that France's allies ignored the significance of North Africa to this bloc, and demanded that "Atlantic solidarity" be reflected in the North African issue.

　　On financial and economic issues, he called for strict measures such as increasing taxes, restricting imports of industrial raw materials when necessary, and implementing rationing of consumer goods.

　　In order to promote the above policies, he regarded amending the constitution to establish a so-called powerful government as the "fundamental task" of his government. He also called for amending the chapter on the French Federation in the constitution in order to establish a "Franco-African Federation."

　　The meeting adjourned temporarily shortly before midnight. During the recess, Pflimlin and "caretaker government" Premier Félix Gaillard, Algerian Resident Minister Lacoste, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Ély, and other political figures conferred on the grave situation caused by the riots in Algeria.

　　When the meeting resumed, Pflimlin spoke again. He said that France may now be "on the verge of civil war." He accused the soldiers who launched the riots in Algeria of "betraying the laws of the Republic" and demanded that the National Assembly take responsibility at this "historic moment."

　　Then the vote was taken. The National Assembly authorized the Pflimlin government. This government consists of Pflimlin (People's Republican Movement) as Prime Minister, Pierre Pflimlin (Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance) as Foreign Minister, Maurice Faure (Radical Socialist Party) as Interior Minister, Pierre de Chevigné (People's Republican Movement) as Defense Minister, André Mutter ("Independent Party") as Algerian Resident Minister, and Edgar Faure (Left Republican Union) as Finance Minister.

　　弗林姆兰组成法国新政府
　　施政纲领鼓吹加紧殖民战争和修改宪法
    据新华社14日讯　巴黎消息：在经过了二十八天的政府危机后，人民共和党领袖弗林姆兰5月13日组成了战后第二十五个法国政府。这届政府是在法国法西斯分子制造的严重局势下组成的。
    弗林姆兰在法国共产党不表示反对的情况下，于13日在国民议会以二百七十四票对一百二十九票得到授权，组成了法国战后第二十五个政府。共产党议会党团发表公报说明在表决时弃权的原因说，由于弗林姆兰表示要继续进行阿尔及利亚战争，因此共产党人不投他的票。但是，由于他表示不会向反共和国的军事政变屈服，因此，共产党决定在表决中弃权，使新政府得以成立。公报郑重声明，共产党议员“将尽一切力量在全国和议会中建立所有反法西斯力量的联盟”。
    议会开会后，弗林姆兰首先发言，说明他的政府的施政纲领。他强调，他的政府的阿尔及利亚政策是：以实力求和平。因此，它首先要竭力加紧阿尔及利亚殖民战争，然后再选择“最有利的时刻”开始谈判停火。他要求法国人民为此作出“新的牺牲”，并且表示将增加阿尔及利亚战争费用。作为军事行动的补充手段，他还要求加紧实施阿尔及利亚“根本法”。同时，他表示不打算事先就拒绝突尼斯和摩洛哥在阿尔及利亚问题上进行调停。
    在北大西洋联盟问题上，他一方面强调这个军事集团对所谓欧洲“安全”的重要性，另一方面又埋怨法国的盟友忽视北非对这个集团的意义，而要求在北非问题上体现“大西洋团结”。
    在财政经济问题上，他要求采取严格的措施，如增加赋税、在必要时限制工业原料进口和实行消费品配给制等等。
    为了推行上述政策，他把修改宪法以便建立一个所谓强有力的政府作为他的政府的“根本任务”。他还要求修改宪法中关于法兰西联邦的一章，以便成立“法国—非洲联邦”。
    会议在午夜前不久宣布暂时休会。休会期间，弗林姆兰和“看守政府”总理盖伊阿及阿尔及利亚驻节部长拉戈斯特、武装部队参谋长埃利以及其他一些政界人士，就阿尔及利亚的暴乱所造成的严重局势进行了会商。
    会议复会后，弗林姆兰再次发言。他说，法国现在可能“处在内战的边缘”。他指责在阿尔及利亚发动暴乱的军人“背叛了共和国的法律”，并且要求国民议会在这个“历史性时刻”负起责任来。
    接着进行表决。国民议会通过授权给弗林姆兰政府。这个政府由弗林姆兰（人民共和党）当总理，普利文（民主社会抵抗联盟）当外交部长，莫里斯·富尔（激进社会党）当内政部长，波埃尔·德谢维?（人民共和党）当国防部长，安德烈·缪特（“独立党”）当阿尔及利亚驻节部长，埃加·富尔（左翼共和联盟）当财政部长。
