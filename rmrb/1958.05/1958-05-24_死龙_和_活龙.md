    "Dead Dragon" and "Living Dragon"
    Bao Ming
    Not long ago, a factory in Wuhan found that the production efficiency of its "one-dragon" assembly line was actually lagging behind that of ordinary machines. Why did this phenomenon occur? The factory mobilized the masses to discuss it, and everyone found the reasons: the chief engineer and deputy chief engineer did not cooperate; the technical measures were not clearly explained to the masses; advanced experiences from brother factories were not seriously studied... In short, their "one-dragon" lacked a political soul, so the masses called it a "dead dragon." On the contrary, another factory—Zhenhuan Yarn Factory—did not relax its daily political and ideological work in its "one-dragon" experimental plot, and used strengthened political and ideological leadership to resolve relations in all aspects, implement the mass line, and therefore its production was very good, and the masses called it a "soaring, cloud-riding living dragon."
    These two situations illustrate a problem: In applying the experimental plot method of leadership, if we take politics as the commander and use political ideology to lead production and operations, then we can make the experimental plot a locomotive that drives overall work and makes leadership work more lively. If we only focus on the form and treat it as a simple solution to technical problems, while neglecting political and ideological leadership, we will make this very dynamic leadership method weak and powerless, unable to play its role.
    In establishing experimental plots, there are two kinds of understanding and two kinds of practices, also manifested in the issue of achieving "both red and expert" through experimental plots. One approach is that although they "established" experimental plots and also participated in labor, they often only saw machines and not people, only talked about technology and not ideology, and ignored that machines are controlled by people and technology is mastered by people. As a result, the work of people was not done well, people's initiative could not be brought into play, and production problems could not be well resolved, so they could not achieve "both red and expert." Another approach is to clearly recognize that participating in labor in experimental plots is to go among the masses to lead the masses, and to go into production to lead production. These comrades contacted the masses through participating in production labor, understood the masses, did a good job of the masses' work, gathered the opinions of the masses, and implemented them. They implemented the mass line in production leadership, and as a result, they took a step forward on the road of "both red and expert."
    The two approaches are also reflected in using advanced experience to innovate production and operations through experimental plots. Some comrades became complacent with a little achievement, stuck to old ways, and were unwilling to honestly learn advanced experience. Although they established experimental plots, they could not use them to innovate their own production and operations. Some comrades were also willing to "learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced," but they did not sufficiently recognize their serious detachment from reality, and still insisted on implementing a set of technical measures determined by their own subjective views, regardless of the consequences. As a result, although these measures were also advanced experiences moved from books or other places, they were not well integrated with the actual production conditions of the factory and could not achieve the desired results, nor could they achieve the purpose of innovating production and operations. Another approach is to educate cadres to go directly into production practice to understand the actual situation, while absorbing experienced veteran workers to participate in operational leadership, and in the experimental field through "experiment, summarize, promote, re-experiment, re-summarize, re-promote, repeated cycle, continuous improvement" approach, so that theory and practice combined, so that advanced experience and the factory's actual production combined, the factory's production business will be a new look.
    The two approaches are also reflected in driving the overall work through experimental plots. Some comrades also know the significance of cultivating typical examples, but they often either artificially set many special conditions for the typical example, or do not educate the masses, as a result, the masses do not support the typical example, and it is difficult for the typical example to accumulate experience. Even if there is a little experience, it is difficult to promote it among the masses. Another approach is to conduct collectivism education among cadres and the masses, so that there is unanimous understanding from top to bottom that cultivating typical examples is to obtain experience from the point to guide the whole, to understand the relationship of "everyone for the experimental field, the experimental field for everyone," and everyone actively supports the typical example, learning from the typical example, so that the experimental field can quickly create experience, and these experiences can quickly be promoted on the surface.
    Organizing a great leap forward in production on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign requires further resolution of the leadership method problem. And planting experimental plots is a basic method of leading production. It is also an important aspect for cadres to achieve both red and expert. Therefore, how to correctly apply this new leadership method in all walks of life, to achieve the unity of politics and technology, from the above situation, has not been completely resolved, and further need to correct understanding in practice, improve thinking, so that the experimental field give full play to its role.

    “死龙”和“活龙”
    葆铭
    不久前，武汉有个工厂的“一条龙”上的生产效率反而落后于一般机台。为什么会发生这种现象呢？这个厂发动群众讨论，大家找出的原因是：正副总工程师不协作；贯彻技术措施不向群众交代清楚；对兄弟工厂的先进经验不认真学习……总之，他们的“一条龙”缺少政治灵魂，所以群众把它叫做“死龙”。相反，另一个工厂——震寰纱厂在搞“一条龙”试验田中，没有放松日常的政治思想工作，用加强政治思想领导来解决各方面的关系，贯彻群众路线，因此生产搞得很好，群众把它叫做“腾云驾雾的活龙”。
    这两个情况说明了一个问题：在运用种试验田这个领导方法中，如果我们是以政治做统帅，以政治思想来领导生产业务，那末就能使试验田成为带动全面工作的火车头，使领导工作更加生动活泼。如果只是从形式着眼，把它当作单纯解决技术问题的办法，而忽视政治思想领导，就会把这个活力很强的领导方法搞得贫弱无力，不能发挥作用。
    在建立试验田中，存在着两种认识和两种做法，还表现在通过种试验田实现“又红又专”的问题上。一种做法是虽然“建立”了试验田，也参加了劳动，但他们往往只见机器不见人，只谈技术不谈思想，忽视了机器是人驾御的，技术是人掌握的。结果人的工作没做好，人的能动性不能发挥，生产问题也不能很好解决，因而也就不能实现“又红又专”。另一种做法则是明确认识到参加试验田的劳动是为了到群众中间去领导群众，到生产中间去领导生产。这些同志通过参加生产劳动去联系群众，了解群众，做好群众的工作，将群众的意见集中起来，贯彻下去，在生产领导中贯彻了群众路线，结果在“又红又专”的道路上迈进了一步。
    两种做法也表现在通过种试验田用先进经验革新生产业务的问题上。有的同志有了一点成绩便沾沾自喜，故步自封，不肯老老实实地学习先进经验，虽然建立了试验田，也不能用来革新自己的生产业务。有的同志也愿意“学习先进，赶上先进”，但他们对自己严重脱离实际的情况认识不足，仍然凭自己主观决定一套技术措施硬要群众贯彻，结果这些措施虽然也是从书上或其他地方搬来的先进经验，但没有与本厂的实际生产情况结合好，收不到应有的效果，也不能达到革新生产业务的目的。另一种做法则是一方面教育干部直接深入生产实际，了解实际；一方面吸收经验丰富的老工人参加业务领导，并在试验田上通过“试验、总结、推广，再试验、再总结、再推广，反复循环，不断提高”的办法，使理论与实践相结合，使先进经验与本厂的生产实际相结合，本厂的生产业务也就随之焕然一新。
    两种做法也表现在通过种试验田带动全盘工作的问题上。有的同志虽然也知道培养典型的意义，但他们往往或者人为地为典型设置了许多特殊条件，或者不向群众进行教育，结果群众不支持典型，典型也就很难积累经验，即或有了一点经验，也很难在群众中推广。另一种则是在干部和群众中进行集体主义教育，使上下一致认识到培养典型是为了从点上取得经验指导全面，了解“人人为试验田，试验田为人人”的关系，大家也就积极支持典型，学习典型，使试验田能很快创造出经验，并能很快地在面上推广这些经验。
    在整风胜利的基础上组织生产大跃进，需要进一步解决领导方法问题。而种试验田是一种领导生产的基本方法。又是干部达到又红又专的一个重要方面。因此，如何在各行各业中正确运用这个新的领导方法，实现政治和技术的统一，从上述的情况看来，还没有完全解决，还需要进一步在实践中矫正认识，提高思想，使试验田充分发挥作用。
