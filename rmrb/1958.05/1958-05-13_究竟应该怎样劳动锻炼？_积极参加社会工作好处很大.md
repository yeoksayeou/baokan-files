　　How should labor training be carried out?
　　Actively participating in social work is very beneficial
　　Every object and every detail of life I encountered in the countryside was a form of training and a test for me, an intellectual who "doesn't move his limbs and can't distinguish the five grains." For example, in the early days of being sent to the countryside, I ate cornmeal soup mixed with sweet potato leaves, which I found difficult to swallow, and even though I ate it, I didn't feel comfortable. Also, eating beside the cattle trough with the villagers (the cattle trough, kitchen, and bedroom of the peasant family I ate with were all crammed into one large room) felt unsanitary and unaccustomed. Furthermore, during meals, a group of rural children with muddy faces and snot running down their mouths would often crowd into the room, which I found very annoying. These things, in essence, reflected that I had not yet established the idea of sharing weal and woe with the peasants, and had not yet established deep class feelings with them. I overcame these wrong ideas by living, working, and doing social work with the peasants, and after initially learning many of their good qualities, I gradually corrected them after a period of ideological struggle. Now I will just talk about my feelings about a few things I encountered while participating in social work.
　　Not long after arriving in the countryside, the commune launched a rectification movement of airing views and speaking out freely, and I participated in airing views meetings or discussion meetings every night. An old woman tore up her oil purchase certificate, and the supply and marketing cooperative wouldn't let her buy snacks. The old woman was very unhappy and spoke nonsense. Comrade Huo Jiyu, the branch secretary, criticized her sternly at the meeting, saying, "You old rich peasant woman have never been honest. What is your intention in tearing up the oil purchase certificate? It is very obvious that you are dissatisfied with our socialism. Not only will we not sell you snacks, but you must also make a good self-criticism." When I heard these words at the time, I felt both ashamed and admired. Ashamed because I had studied Marxism-Leninism for several years, but when faced with such a concrete problem, I forgot the class viewpoint, and my heart softened, thinking that it was no big deal to let her buy two packets of snacks for the Spring Festival, revealing sentimentalism. Admired because the branch secretary had neither much education nor studied theory, but could use the method of class analysis extremely naturally to resolutely give the class alien element a merciless counterattack on such a concrete problem. Recently, our commune held an exhibition comparing life in the old and new societies. I participated in the historical compilation work of the village. When the branch secretary and several old commune members who had personally experienced the situation recalled the tragic situation during the rule of Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, when the people of the whole village were subjected to the landlords, despots, and reactionaries' burning, killing, looting, raping, and exploitation, a burst of class hatred burst out from their hearts, and they could not calm down for a long time. This extremely rich political lesson was better than reading books for three years. I participated in the formulation of the commune's 1958 production plan and ten-year long-term plan. After repeated research and discussions by the commune cadres, the grain production target changed again and again, from crossing the Yellow River in three years and the Yangtze River in five years to achieving a per-mu yield of one thousand catties of grain this year. I was not only moved by their advanced spirit of daring to think and act, but also felt excited and proud that my commune would soon become a prosperous and happy new socialist village, thus strengthening my will for labor training and strengthening my determination to be in the countryside and have my heart in the countryside.
　　From this, it can be seen that if a cadre sent to the countryside regards participating in social work as something dispensable, he is either a lazy person or does not sufficiently recognize the significance of the close combination of labor training and ideological transformation. This will have an extremely adverse impact on comprehensive training.

### 究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？　积极参加社会工作好处很大

　　究竟应该怎样劳动锻炼？
　　积极参加社会工作好处很大
    我在农村中遇到的每一事物和每一个生活小节，对我这个“四肢不勤、五谷不分”的知识分子说来，都是一种锻炼与考验。譬如在下放初期，吃的是苞米面汤里掺红薯叶子，觉得难于下咽，虽然吃下去了，但心情并不舒畅。又譬如同老乡们一块儿蹬在牛槽旁吃饭（我吃饭的那家农民的牛槽、厨房和卧室都挤在一大间屋内），觉得既不卫生又不习惯。再譬如在吃饭的时候，往往有一群满脸泥土、鼻涕流到嘴边的农村孩子拥到屋内，心里就很厌烦。这些，实质上都反映自己还没有树立与农民同甘共苦的思想，还未能和农民建立起深厚的阶级感情。对这些错误思想的克服，我是通过同农民一齐生活、劳动与做社会工作，初步学习到农民的许多优点之后，经过一番思想斗争，才逐步得到纠正的。现在我仅就参加社会工作中所遇到的几件事情谈谈自己的感受。
    下乡不久，正值社里开展大鸣大放的整风运动，我天天晚上参加鸣放会或讨论会。一个老太婆把她的购油证撕掉了，供销社不让她买点心，老太婆很不高兴，乱说怪话。支部书记火吉玉同志在大会上声色俱厉地批评她说：“你这个富农老婆子在平时就不老实，你撕毁购油证是啥思想？很明显，你是对我们社会主义不满。不但不卖给你点心，你还得好好检讨”。我当时听了这一番话，心里既惭愧又钦佩，惭愧的是自己学了几年马列主义，遇到这样一个具体问题，忘掉了阶级观点，心里发软，认为过春节让她买两包点心有啥了不起，流露出温情主义的情绪。钦佩的是支部书记既没有多少文化更没有学过理论，但对这样一个具体问题，却能极其自然地运用阶级分析的方法，坚决地给予阶级异己分子以无情的反击。最近我社举办了一个新旧社会生活对比展览会，我参加了该村历史编纂工作，当支部书记和几位身历其境的老社员回忆起在日本帝国主义和国民党反动派统治时期，全村人民横遭地主、恶霸和反动派烧杀、抢劫、奸淫和压榨的悲惨情况时，他们不由地从心头冒起一股阶级仇恨的怒火，久久不能平息，这一堂极为丰富的政治课，使我胜读三年书。我参加了社里的1958年生产计划与十年长远规划的制订工作，经过社干部们反复地研究与商讨，粮食生产指标一变再变，由原来的三年过黄河、五年过长江，一跃成为在今年达到亩产千斤粮。我不仅为他们那种敢想敢做的先进精神所感动，也为在不久的将来，我社就将成为一个社会主义的繁荣幸福的新农村而感到兴奋与自豪，从而加强了我的劳动锻炼意志，坚定了人在农村、心在农村的决心。
    由此可见，一个下放干部如果把参加社会工作看成是可有可无的事，他不是懒汉，便是对劳动锻炼与思想改造必须密切结合的意义认识不足。这对全面锻炼来说，将会带来极为不利的影响。
