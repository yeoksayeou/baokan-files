Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 30th -- Guangzhou Table Tennis Team member Rong Guotuan changed his playing style last night from that used in Beijing, defeating European champion Berczik two games to zero (21-19, 21-14). Last night, Rong Guotuan abandoned chopping and pushing, adopting a serve-and-attack strategy from the start. He used topspin shots to the left and right corners, looking for opportunities to smash the opponent's left corner and chest area. He also used long and short balls and blocking to disrupt the opponent's rhythm, thus taking the initiative. Berczik, on the other hand, used chops with varying degrees of spin or no spin at all, to force Rong Guotuan's smashes out of bounds or into the net, and counter-attacked whenever he had the chance. The first game was very intense, with the score tied at two, three, four, all the way up to nineteen. There were eleven ties in total, with the score difference never exceeding three points. After nineteen all, Berczik's attacking shot went out of bounds, and Rong Guotuan finished the first game with a powerful smash. Riding the momentum of his first victory, Rong Guotuan continued to score with smashes in the second game, taking a 6-1 lead. Subsequently, Berczik's topspin shots put pressure on Rong's attack, and his counter-attacks were also successful, closing the gap to 8-7. However, Rong Guotuan remained calm, using topspin shots to the left and right corners, and his powerful attack on the left corner was both fierce and accurate, eventually winning the game 21-14.

Liang Yuhai also defeated European runner-up Jetzevi last night with a score of two to one (21-15, 19-21, 21-15). Liang Yuhai adopted a strategy of pushing on the left and attacking on the right throughout the match, forcing Jetzevi's backhand and preventing Jetzevi's excellent forehand attack from being utilized.

Yesterday evening was the first friendly match between the Hungarian Table Tennis Team and the Guangzhou Table Tennis Team. In the other two men's singles matches, one men's doubles match, three women's singles matches, and one women's doubles match, the Hungarian team won five matches and lost two. As a result, the Hungarian team won with a score of five to four.

    广州乒乓球队迎战匈牙利队
    容国团击败别尔切克
    新华社广州30日电　广州市乒乓球队队员容国团昨晚改变了在北京时的打法，以二比零（二十一比十九、二十一比十四）击败了欧洲冠军别尔切克。容国团昨晚不用搓抽，一上场便采取发球抢攻，提拉左右两角，伺机大板抽杀对方的左角和胸前的战术，有时也用长短球和推挡来打乱对方的阵脚，因此打得很主动。别尔切克则采取削出加减旋转或不转球，使容国团抽杀出界或落网，一有机会就反攻的战术。第一局开始时，打得十分紧张，从二平、三平、四平、一直打到十九平，达十一次平手，双方相差不出三分。十九平后，别尔切克攻球出界，容国团大板抽杀，结束了第一局。容国团乘先胜余威，第二局抽杀连连得手，以六比一领先。接着，别尔切克的加转球压住容的攻势，反攻又告得手，追到八比七，但容国团打得镇定，左右斜角提拉，大板攻击左角又狠又准，最后以二十一比十四得胜。
    梁玉海昨晚也以二比一（二十一比十五、十九比二十一、二十一比十五）战胜欧洲亚军杰特维。梁玉海自始至终采取左推右攻的战术，迫住杰特维的反手，使杰特维出色的正手攻球不能发挥出来。
    昨天晚上是匈牙利乒乓球队和广州市乒乓球队的第一次友谊比赛。在其他的男子二场单打、一场双打，女子三场单打、一场双打中，匈牙利队胜五场、败二场，结果匈牙利队以五比四胜。
