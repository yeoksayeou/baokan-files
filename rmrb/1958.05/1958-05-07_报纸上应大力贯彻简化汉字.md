    Simplified Chinese Characters Should Be Vigorously Implemented in Newspapers
    The Simplified Chinese Character Scheme has been announced for a long time. It is welcomed by the broad masses, especially doing a great good deed for adult illiterates and children learning to write. However, our newspapers and magazines have not fully utilized these already announced simplified Chinese characters. According to the People's Daily, Henan Daily, and Yangcheng Evening News that I have seen, it is not possible to use all the simplified characters. In the People's Daily on April 21 alone, there were more than a dozen simplified characters that had been announced that were not simplified in the headlines, both large and small, on the first and second pages. And self-made strange fonts were found in the Yangcheng Evening News, such as the character "街" (street), written as "亍". In order to enable newspapers to fully exert their publicity and educational role in various tasks, it is hoped that newspapers can fully use all the simplified characters that have been announced.

    报纸上应大力贯彻简化汉字
    汉字简化方案早就公布了。它受到广大群众的欢迎，尤其是给成人文盲和初学文字的儿童们做了件大好事。但是，我们的报刊、杂志，还没有把这些已经公布的简化汉字充分地运用起来。据我看到的人民日报、河南日报、羊城晚报等报纸，对已简化的字不能全部使用。仅4月21日的人民日报第一、二版大小标题中，就有十几个已经公布的简化字没有简化。并在羊城晚报上发现自造的怪字体，如“街”字，写为“亍”字。为了使报纸在各项工作中充分发挥它的宣传和教育作用，希望报纸对已公布的简化字能全部使用。
