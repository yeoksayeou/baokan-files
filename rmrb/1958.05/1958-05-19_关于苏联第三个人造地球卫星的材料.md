Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th, TASS dispatch from Moscow, May 18th: "Pravda" today published materials on the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite, occupying two full pages. The newspaper also published a picture of the satellite's appearance, a schematic diagram indicating the position of instruments inside the satellite, and a schematic diagram of the satellite separating from the carrier rocket.

The newspaper pointed out that the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite was sent into orbit by a powerful carrier rocket. After the carrier rocket with the satellite reached a speed of more than eight kilometers per second on the predetermined flight path, the satellite separated from the carrier rocket due to the action of special devices and began to orbit the Earth along an elliptical orbit. When the satellite separated from the carrier rocket, the conical shroud and shield separated from the satellite. The carrier rocket and conical shroud, carrying the shield, travel along their own orbits, not far from the satellite's orbit.

The newspaper then talked about the satellite's total weight, volume, shape, and the weight of the instruments in the satellite. The newspaper pointed out that the huge weight of the Soviet Union's third satellite proves that the carrier rocket that sent the satellite into orbit is of excellent quality.

The newspaper continued, the continuous increase in the weight of Soviet satellites proves the further growth of the power of Soviet rocket technology. It is now possible to launch rockets into space, beyond the Earth's gravitational range. In order to make this event scientifically valuable and a realistic step towards achieving interplanetary flight, such cosmic rockets must be equipped with a considerable amount of scientific and measuring instruments, and after launching such rockets, new data on cosmic physical phenomena and cosmic flight conditions can be obtained.

Satellite Orbit and Observation of Satellite Operation

In the section "Satellite Orbit and Observation of Satellite Operation," the newspaper said: Using the materials accumulated during the launch of the first two Soviet artificial satellites, after sorting out the preliminary measurement results of the orbital parameters of the third satellite, it will soon be possible to predict its existence time quite accurately.

The third satellite's operation around the Earth is similar to that of the first two Soviet artificial satellites. Due to the Earth's rotation and the precession of the orbit, in mid-latitude regions, the satellite's trajectory moves approximately 1,500 kilometers westward in each subsequent orbit compared to the previous orbit. The speed of orbital precession is approximately four degrees per day.

The satellite's operation is observed using radio technology and optical methods. The tools and methods for observing the third satellite have been greatly improved. The satellite is equipped with several radio transmitters, which can be used to measure the satellite's coordinates as it moves along its orbit. The measurement work is carried out by a number of specially established scientific stations equipped with a large amount of radio technology equipment.

Due to the high transmission power of the transmitters, ordinary radio enthusiasts' receivers can also reliably receive the signals it emits at long distances. Systematically recording these signals, especially using magnetic tape recording methods that are easily accessible to radio enthusiasts, will have significant scientific meaning.

It is also very meaningful to use radio observations of the satellite's operation based on the Doppler effect. Observations of the first two Soviet satellites have proven that this method is extremely effective. As long as the measurement results are sorted by astronomical time, accurate data on the satellite's operation can be obtained.

When organizing optical observations of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite, the experience gained from observing the first two artificial satellites was also absorbed. Photographic observation methods have been greatly improved.

Of particular significance is the use of electro-optical converters to photograph artificial satellites. With this instrument, clear images of the satellite can be obtained from extremely long distances. The equipment samples using electro-optical converters to photograph artificial satellite images were successfully tested during the observation of the second artificial satellite.

Construction of the Soviet Union's Third Artificial Satellite

"Pravda" then described in detail the "Construction of the Soviet Union's Third Artificial Satellite." "Pravda" wrote: The Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite is a veritable cosmic automatic scientific station.

The sealed satellite body is conical in shape and made of aluminum alloy. Its surface, like the surfaces of the first two artificial satellites, is highly polished and specially treated to have the necessary radiation and absorption coefficient values for solar radiation. The detachable rear base of the satellite body is bolted tightly to the joint bulkhead, and special sealing methods are used to ensure the airtightness of the joint. Before launch, the inside of the satellite is filled with gaseous nitrogen.

Inside the satellite body, on the rear instrument rack made of magnesium alloy, are placed: radio telemetry devices, radio equipment for measuring satellite coordinates, program timing devices, instruments for temperature regulation and temperature measurement systems, automatic devices to ensure the opening and closing of equipment, and chemical energy devices. The rear rack also contains instruments for measuring the intensity and composition of cosmic rays and devices for recording micrometeorite impacts. The rack is fixed to the load-bearing assembly of the satellite body's outer shell.

Another instrument rack located in the front part of the satellite inside the satellite also contains the basic instruments for scientific investigation and power supply devices. On this rack are placed electronic instrument groups, which are used to measure atmospheric pressure, ion composition, positive ion concentration, charge value and electrostatic field strength, magnetic field strength, and the intensity of solar particle radiation. Radio transmitters are also provided here.

The positions of the sensitive elements (sensors) of the scientific instruments are determined according to their uses. The magnetometer is placed in the front part of the satellite, with the aim of keeping it as far away from other instruments as possible. The cosmic ray counter is placed inside the satellite. The sensors of other scientific instruments are located outside the sealed satellite body. The photomultiplier tube used to record solar particle radiation is installed in the front of the satellite body. A magnetic pressure gauge and two ionization pressure gauges are placed in cylindrical cups welded into the outer shell of the front part of the satellite to measure the pressure of the upper atmosphere. Near them, two electrostatic fluxmeters for measuring charge and electrostatic field strength and a radio frequency mass spectrometer for determining the composition of high-altitude ions are installed.

On two tubular rods fixed to the outer shell of the satellite body with movable joints, spherical mesh ion collectors are installed, which measure the positive ion concentration when the satellite is running along its orbit. Before the satellite enters orbit, the rods with collectors are close to the surface of the satellite body. After the satellite enters orbit, the movable joints of the rods open, making the rods perpendicular to the side surface of the satellite.

Four sensors are installed on the rear bottom of the satellite body to record micrometeorite impacts.

Semiconductor solar cells are divided into several groups and installed on the surface of the satellite body. Four small groups are installed on the front bottom, four groups are installed on the side surface, and one group is installed on the rear bottom. Such distribution of solar cell groups can ensure the normal operation of the cells, regardless of the satellite's orientation towards the sun.

There is a special protective cover on the front of the satellite, which will be discarded after the satellite enters orbit.

The newspaper then said that the characteristics of the satellite's multi-channel radio telemetry system is that it has very high resolution. It can send a very large amount of scientific intelligence related to scientific measurements performed by the satellite to the ground. The radio telemetry system includes a series of devices used to continuously remember the data of scientific measurements performed during satellite flight. When the satellite flies over a ground measurement station, the "remembered" intelligence is sent down from the satellite at extremely high speed.

The temperature measurement system equipped on the satellite continuously records the temperature of the satellite's surface and various points inside the satellite.

The operation of all scientific instruments and measuring instruments is automatically controlled. The instruments are periodically turned on and off, which is controlled by the electronic program timing device. This device also periodically emits highly accurate time marks, which are necessary for subsequent sorting of scientific measurement results according to astronomical time and geographical coordinates.

The temperature regulation system ensures that the temperature on the satellite remains stable. This temperature regulation system is greatly improved compared to the temperature regulation systems used by the previous two satellites. The method of regulating temperature is to change the forced circulation of gaseous nitrogen inside the satellite and to change the radiation coefficient of the satellite's surface itself. For this purpose, adjustable louvers composed of sixteen components are installed on the side of the satellite. The opening and closing of the louvers are controlled by wires operated by the instruments of the temperature regulation system.

The newspaper then wrote that the study of the ionosphere occupies an important position in the scientific exploration plan using the Soviet Union's third Earth satellite.

Simultaneous with ground measurements, direct measurements of the characteristics of the ionosphere are performed using the Soviet Union's third satellite.

Direct measurement of the characteristics of the ionosphere with instruments on the satellite, different from the method based on the study of radio wave propagation, is characterized by the fact that the measurement results are not affected by the characteristics of the entire ionosphere between the satellite and the Earth, nor by various changes in the ionosphere.

On the satellite, the concentration of charged particles and the mass spectrum of positive ions in the ionosphere can be determined. The above-mentioned various measurements, plus the measurement of the electrostatic field strength on the surface of the satellite (the electrostatic field on the surface of the satellite has an impact on the results of these experiments), constitute a complete set of mutually supplementary and complete experiments.

Two spherical mesh ion collectors are installed above the surface of the satellite to measure the concentration of positive ions in the orbit. Each collector has a spherical concentrator inside with an electrical potential opposite to that of the outer shell. The electric field thus created can collect all the positive ions entering the collector into the concentrator and expel negative ions from the collector. Since the satellite's speed is much higher than the average speed of ion thermal motion, when a spherical collector is used, it can be considered that the ion flow on the surface of the collector depends entirely on the satellite's operation, and does not depend on the air temperature that changes with altitude, nor does it depend on the satellite's orientation related to the satellite's speed.

Investigation of the Composition of the Ionosphere

In the section "Investigation of the Composition of the Ionosphere," "Pravda" wrote: The atomic and molecular weights of the elements and compounds of these elements that make up a certain mixture are determined using a mass spectrometer.

The purpose of the mass spectrometer installed on the third Soviet satellite is to determine the mass spectrum of positive ions in the Earth's ionosphere. Knowing the ion mass, certain conclusions can be drawn about the chemical composition of the ionosphere.

Research on Electrostatic Fields

In the section "Research on Electrostatic Fields," the newspaper said: The instrument used on the satellite consists of two sensitive electrostatic fluxmeters, both used for control. This set of instruments consists of two sensors symmetrically installed on the side surface of the satellite and an instrument group with an amplifier.

The main part of each sensor is a measuring electrode—a thin sheet composed of ten components connected to the satellite body through a resistor. The surface of the sheet appears to be part of the satellite surface. This sheet is periodically shielded by another sheet (a screen rotated by a motor). Because the measuring sheet is part of the satellite surface, when it is not covered by another sheet, it has both the charge of the satellite itself and the induced charge generated by the external electrostatic field. When this sheet is shielded, the charge on the sheet disappears.

Geomagnetic Field Measurement

In the "Geomagnetic Field Measurement" section of the newspaper, it is pointed out that the magnetometer device on the satellite can perform magnetic force measurements on the entire earth in a very short period of time, which can provide very rare conditions for investigating the changing parts of the magnetic field.

Cosmic Ray Research

In the part of the newspaper "Cosmic Ray Research", it is pointed out that the satellite can separately record cosmic rays of different energies as it moves along its orbit.

New information about the changes in cosmic ray intensity and its energy spectrum can be obtained through cosmic ray counters installed on the satellite.

The instruments equipped on the satellite make it possible to attempt experimentally for the first time to search for gamma rays in the original cosmic ray composition. If this attempt is successful, then we can talk about a new method of studying the universe.

Investigation of Solar Particle Radiation

This section "Investigation of Solar Particle Radiation" talks about: In addition to recording solar particle radiation, the instruments installed on the satellite can also obtain supplementary information on X-rays, which will also be recorded by the particle detector.

The following sections talk about the measurement of atmospheric pressure and density, and the investigation of micrometeorites.

Power Supply of Instruments

The title of the last section is "Power Supply of Instruments". "Pravda" wrote that the power supply of the satellite's scientific instruments and measuring instruments are silver-zinc storage batteries and oxide-mercury batteries. Soviet researchers have improved these storage batteries and batteries to make them have high discharge performance per unit weight and per unit volume, suitable for use on satellites.

In addition to chemical power sources, the third satellite is also equipped with a complete set of solar cells. These batteries directly convert solar radiation energy into electrical energy.

"Pravda" finally wrote that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite once again proves the achievements of Soviet rocket technology. The extensive and interconnected set of investigations conducted by the satellite will make a huge contribution to the development of science. The successful launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite is one of the most prominent events in the International Geophysical Year. The satellite's large size and high degree of automation have advanced Soviet science and technology towards the manufacture of spacecraft.

　　关于苏联第三个人造地球卫星的材料
　　苏联“真理报”
    新华社18日讯　塔斯社莫斯科18日讯：“真理报”今天以两版篇幅刊载了关于苏联第三个人造地球卫星的材料。这家报纸还刊登了卫星外貌的图片，表明卫星内部仪器位置的示意图以及卫星脱离运载火箭的示意图。
    报纸指出，苏联第三个人造地球卫星是用强大的运载火箭送上轨道的。带有卫星的运载火箭在预定的飞行轨道上达到每秒八千公尺以上的速度以后，卫星就由于专门装置的作用脱离了运载火箭，开始沿椭圆形轨道围绕地球运行。在卫星脱离运载火箭的时候，圆锥形护套和护板即脱离了卫星。带着护板的运载火箭和圆锥形护套沿着自己的轨道运行，同卫星轨道相差不远。
    报纸接着谈到卫星的总重量、体积、形状以及卫星中仪器的重量。报纸指出，苏联第三个卫星的巨大重量证明，送卫星上轨道的运载火箭是质量高超的。
    报纸接着说，苏联卫星的重量的不断增加，证明苏联火箭技术的威力的进一步增长。现在就已经有可能把火箭发射到宇宙中，发射到地球引力范围以外。为了使这件事具有科学价值，成为实现行星际飞行的现实的一步，必须在这种宇宙火箭上装备相当丰富的科学仪器和测量仪器，并在发射这种火箭之后，能够得到有关宇宙间物理现象和有关宇宙飞行条件的新资料。
    卫星的轨道和对卫星运行的观察
    报纸在“卫星的轨道和对卫星运行的观察”这一部分中说：利用发射头两个苏联人造卫星时所积累下来的材料，在整理了对第三个卫星的轨道参数的初步测量结果以后，很快就可以相当正确地预测出它存在的时间。
    第三个卫星围绕地球运行的情况同头两个苏联人造卫星相似。由于地球自转和轨道的进动，在中纬地区，卫星运行路线后一圈要比前一圈往西移动约一千五百公里。轨道进动的速度每昼夜约四度。
    卫星运行情况是用无线电技术和光学方法观测的，观测第三个卫星的工具和方法大大改进了。卫星上装有数个无线电发射装置，可以借此测量卫星沿轨道运行时的座标。测量工作由一些专门设立的、配备有大量无线电技术设备的科学站进行。
    由于发射机发射功率强大，普通无线电爱好者的接收机也可以有把握地在远距离收到它发出的讯号。有系统地把这些讯号记录下来，特别是用无线电爱好者很容易用上的磁带录音方法记录下来，这种记录将有重大的科学意义。
    运用都普勒效应为基础来对卫星的运行进行无线电观测，也是很有意义的。对苏联头两个卫星观测的情况证明，这个方法极有效，只要把测量结果按天文时加以整理就可以得到卫星运行的精确数据。
    在对苏联第三个人造卫星的运行组织光学观测的时候，还吸取了观测头两个人造卫星所获得的经验。照相观测方法已大大改善。
    特别有意义的是使用电子光学变换器来拍摄人造卫星照片，用这种仪器可以在极远的距离获得清晰的卫星影像。利用电子光学变换器拍摄人造卫星图片的器械样品在观测第二个人造卫星的时候已经试验成功。
    苏联第三个人造卫星的构造
    “真理报”接着详细叙述了“苏联第三个人造卫星的构造”，“真理报”写道：苏联第三个人造卫星是一个名副其实的宇宙自动科学站。
    密封的卫星体呈圆锥形，由铝合金制成。它的表面，像头两个人造卫星的表面一样，磨得很光并且经过特别加工，因而对太阳辐射具有必要的辐射和吸收系数值。卫星体上可卸的后底用螺栓紧扣在接合隔框上，用特别密封的方法来保证接合处的密闭程度。发射以前卫星内部充满了气态氮。
    在卫星体内用镁合金制成的后部仪器架上放有：无线电遥测装置、测量卫星座标用的无线电设备、程序时间装置、温度调闭和温度测量系统仪器、保证设备开动和关闭的自动装置、化学能源装置。后架上还放有测量宇宙线强度和组成的仪器和记录微流星撞击的装置。架子固定在卫星体外壳的承力组合件上。
    在卫星内部位于卫星前部的另一个仪器架上也放有进行科学考察的基本仪器和电源装置。在这个架上放有电子仪器组，它们是用来测量大气压力、离子成分、正离子浓度、电荷值和静电场强度、磁场强度和太阳微粒辐射强度的。这里还设有无线电发射机。
    科学仪器的灵敏元件（传感器）的位置是根据它们的用途决定的。磁力计放在卫星的前部，其目的是使它离开其他仪器尽可能远。宇宙线计数器放在卫星内部。其他科学仪器的传感器位于密封的卫星体外部。用来记录太阳微粒辐射的光电倍增管装在卫星体前部。一个磁力压力表和两个电离压力表放在焊入卫星前部外壳的圆筒形的杯内，用来测量高层大气的压力。在它们附近，装有用来测量电荷和静电场强度的两个静电磁通计和一个测定高空离子成份的射频质谱分光计。
    在两个用活动关节固定在卫星体外壳上的管状杆上，装有球形网状离子收集器，它在卫星沿轨道运行时测量正离子浓度。在卫星进入轨道前，带收集器的杆紧贴在卫星体表面。卫星进入轨道后，杆的活动关节转开来，使杆同卫星的侧表面垂直。
    在卫星体的后底部装有四个传感器，以记录微流星撞击的情况。
    半导体太阳能电池分成一些组，分装在卫星体表面。四组小的装在前底部，四组装在侧表面，一组装在后底部。太阳能电池组这样分布可以保证电池正常操作，而不受卫星对太阳的方位的限制。
    卫星前部有一个特别的保护套，卫星进入轨道后，即将此套抛掉。
    报纸接着说，卫星的多路无线电遥测系统的特点是，它具有很高的分辨能力。它可以把卫星进行的极大量的有关科学测量的科学情报发到地面上来。无线电遥测系统包括一系列装置，用来不断记住卫星飞行时进行的科学测量的数据。卫星飞过地面测量站时，“记住的”情报以极大速度从卫星上发送下来。
    卫星上装备的温度测量系统，不断地记录下卫星表面和卫星内部各点的温度。
    全部科学仪器和测量仪器的工作都是自动操纵的，仪器周期地开动和关闭，是由电子程序时间装置来控制的。这种装置也周期地发出高度准确的时间记号，这是以后把科学测量结果按天文时和地理座标加以整理所必需的。
    温度调节系统保证卫星上的温度保持稳定，这个温度调节系统比前两个卫星所用的温度调节系统有很大的改进。调节温度的方法是改变卫星内气态氮的强制循环和改变卫星表面本身辐射系数。为此在卫星侧面上装了由十六个分件组成的调节百叶窗。百叶窗的开和关，由受温度调节系统的仪器操纵的电线控制。
    报纸接着写道，在用苏联第三个地球卫星进行的科学考察计划中，电离层的研究占着重要位置。
    与地面测量同时，用苏联第三个卫星对电离层的特性进行直接测量。
    用卫星上的仪器直接测量电离层特性，跟以研究无线电波传播为基础的方法不同，它的特点是，测量结果不受卫星跟地球之间整个电离层特性的影响，也不受电离层种种变化影响。
    在卫星上可以确定电离层中带电粒子的浓度和正离子的质谱。上述种种测量加上对卫星表面的静电场强度的测量（卫星表面的静电场对这些试验的结果是有影响的），构成一整套互相补充的完整的试验。
    两个球形网状离子收集器装在卫星表面的上方，用来测量轨道上的正离子浓度。每个收集器内部有一个电势同外壳相反的球形集中器。这样造成的电场可以把所有进入收集器的正离子收集到集中器中，并且把负离子逐出收集器。由于卫星的速度比离子热运动的平均速度高许多倍，所以在采用球状收集器的时候就可以认为，收集器表面的离子流完全取决于卫星的运行，而不取决于随着高度而变化的空气温度，也不取决于与卫星速度有关的卫星方位。
    对电离层组成的考察
    “真理报”在“对电离层组成的考察”部分写道：组成某种混合物的元素和这些元素的化合物的原子量和分子量，是利用质谱分光计来确定的。
    装在第三个苏联卫星上的质谱分光计的用途是确定地球电离层正离子的质谱。知道离子质量以后，就可以对电离层的化学成分作出某些结论。
    静电场的研究
    报纸“静电场的研究”部分中说：卫星上使用的仪器是由两个同是用于控制的灵敏静电磁通计组成的。这套仪器是由两个对称地安装在卫星侧表面的传感器和一个带有放大器的仪器组构成的。
    每个传感器的主要部分都是测量用电极——通过电阻与卫星体相连接的一个由十个分件组成的薄片。薄片的表面看来像是卫星表面的一部分。这个薄片周期地被另一个薄片（用电动机转动的屏）遮蔽。因为测量用的薄片是卫星表面的一部分，所以当它没有被另一薄片遮住时，在它的上面既有卫星本身的电荷也有由外部静电场产生的感应电荷。这个薄片被遮蔽时，薄片上的电荷就消失了。
    地磁场测量
    报纸在“地磁场测量”部分中指出，卫星上的磁力计装置可以在很短时间内对整个地球进行磁力测量，这就可以提供很难得的条件对磁场的变化部分进行考察。
    宇宙线研究
    报纸在“宇宙线研究”的一部分中指出，卫星由于沿轨道移动，可以分别记录不同能量的宇宙线。
    通过安装在卫星上的宇宙线计数器可以得到关于宇宙线强度变化及其能谱的新情报。
    卫星上装备的仪器，使得它有可能第一次试验性地尝试在原始宇宙线成分中寻找丙种射线。如果这一尝试获得成功，那就可以谈到研究宇宙的新方法了。
    对太阳粒子辐射的考察
    “对太阳粒子辐射的考察”这一部分谈到：卫星上装置的仪器除了记录太阳微粒辐射以外，还可以获得X射线的补充资料，这种射线情况也将由微粒检验器记录下来。
    以后的几部分谈到了对大气压力和密度的测量，以及对微流星的考察。
    仪器的电源
    最后一部分的标题是“仪器的电源”。“真理报”写道，卫星的科学仪器和测量仪器的电源是银—锌蓄电池和氧化物——水银电池。苏联研究人员改进了这种蓄电池和电池，使它们单位重量和单位容积的放电性能很高，适合于在卫星上使用。
    除了化学电源外，第三个卫星上还装设有整套的太阳能电池。这些电池把太阳辐射能直接变成电能。
    “真理报”最后写道，苏联第三个人造地球卫星的发射成功，再次证明了苏联火箭技术的成就。卫星所进行的广泛的、互相有联系的整套考察，将对科学的发展做出巨大的贡献。苏联第三个卫星发射成功，是国际地球物理年中最突出的事件之一，卫星的体积巨大，自动化程度很高，这使苏联科学技术朝着制造宇宙飞船方面前进了一步。
