Small Knowledge:

	Small yellow croaker, also known as yellow flower fish, has delicious and tender meat, rich in protein, and highly nutritious. Besides being cooked into various dishes, fresh small yellow croaker can also be pickled and supplied to rural areas. Small yellow croaker scales can be used to make monosodium glutamate (MSG), or turned into liquid through high temperature to be drawn into very beautiful nylon, and then made into fine products such as clothing and socks. The head and bones of small yellow croaker can be made into fish meal.

	The coastal areas of China, including Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, are rich in small yellow croaker, with Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces having the most. Every year, during the turn of spring and summer, is the small yellow croaker spawning season in the coastal fishing grounds, which is also the earliest spring spawning season of the year. From late March, small yellow croaker start migrating from south to north along the East China Sea, South China Sea, and Bohai Sea routes to spawn. Fishermen set sail to follow the fish schools, chasing and catching them day and night. From Qingming to ten days after the Beginning of Summer, the fish schools are highly concentrated, their gonads are fully mature, and they begin to spawn, while floating on the surface of the water and making a frog-like "goo-goo" sound. The faster the tide, the louder the sound. "Frogs croaking in the sea, fishermen smiling gleefully," at this time, the fishing grounds are dotted with fishing boats, sometimes scattered, sometimes gathered. The nets cast by the fishermen often catch thousands of kilograms, or even tens of thousands of kilograms. Because small yellow croaker migrate north in groups, fishermen also concentrate thousands of fishing boats on the sea routes they must pass, intercepting them halfway, waiting for large schools of fish to throw themselves into the net.

	By the turn of summer and autumn, after spawning, small yellow croaker are tired and weak, and mostly temporarily disperse to rest and forage, and then return to their overwintering grounds to inhabit. Thus, the year's small yellow croaker spawning season comes to an end.

    小黄鱼汛
    小黄鱼又叫黄花鱼，肉鲜味美，含有大量蛋白质，营养丰富。除了鲜小黄鱼可以烧成各种各样菜肴外，还可以腌制供应农村。小黄鱼鳞可以做味精，或经过高温变成液体来抽丝制成很漂亮的尼龙，再制成衣料、袜子等精制品。小黄鱼的头和骨头可以制成鱼粉。
    我国沿海辽宁、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、福建、广东等七省盛产小黄鱼，尤以浙江、广东、福建等省为最多。每年春夏之交，是沿海渔场小黄鱼汛期，也是一年最早的春汛。3月下旬，小黄鱼按东海、南海、渤海路线从南到北开始洄游产卵，渔民们扬帆出海跟踪鱼群，日夜追捕。清明到立夏后十天，鱼群十分集中，生殖腺完全成熟，开始产卵，同时浮游水面发出青蛙似的“古古”的叫声，潮流愈急，叫声愈响。“海里田鸡叫，渔民嘴里笑”，这时渔场上星罗棋布的渔船，忽而分散，忽而聚拢，渔民们放下的渔网往往一网捞起几千斤，多的上万斤。因为小黄鱼成群北游，渔民们还在必经的海面上集中几千只渔船，半途截捕，等待大量的鱼群自投罗网。
    到了夏秋之交，小黄鱼由于产卵之后，疲劳衰弱，大都暂时分散休息和作索饵洄游，然后返回越冬场栖息，一年的小黄鱼汛就结束了。
