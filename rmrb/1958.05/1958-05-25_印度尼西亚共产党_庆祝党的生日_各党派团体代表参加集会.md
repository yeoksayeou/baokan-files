Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 24th: The Indonesian Communist Party held a rally in Jakarta on the evening of the 23rd to celebrate the 38th anniversary of the party's founding.

    Indonesian Communist Party Deputy General Secretary Lukman gave a report to the assembly in a warm atmosphere on the development of the party and spoke about the current struggle. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit and Secretariat Secretary Sudisman, among other party leaders, also attended the celebration.

    Representatives from various parties, social organizations, and the people also attended the celebration. Among the representatives were Indonesian Nationalist Party General Chairman Suwirjo, Jakarta Mayor Sudiro, as well as representatives from the Christian Party and members of Parliament. Many people stood outside the meeting hall or sat on the grass outside, listening to Lukman's speech. Many young people climbed onto the windowsills of the meeting hall from outside, shouting "Long live the Indonesian Communist Party."

    In his speech, Lukman pointed out that in the thirty-eight years since its founding, the Indonesian Communist Party, despite experiencing many failures and setbacks, has always stood at the forefront of the national movement struggle. He also pointed out the contributions of other Indonesian parties in the national liberation movement.

    Lukman condemned those who attempt to undermine the Communist Party and the activities of imperialism in interfering in Indonesia. He pointed out that some people are afraid of the imperialists and dare not eliminate the rebel groups. He said that as long as the government takes clear measures, coupled with the support of the people and the support of Asian-African countries and socialist countries, the rebel groups will inevitably be eliminated.

    Lukman also refuted the attempts by some people to attack the Indonesian Communist Party by distorting the essence of the Madiun Affair. He said that the victory of the Indonesian Communist Party in the Madiun local elections shows that the local people trust the Communist Party.

    印度尼西亚共产党
    庆祝党的生日
    各党派团体代表参加集会
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚共产党23日晚上在雅加达举行集会，庆祝党成立三十八周年。
    印度尼西亚共产党副总书记鲁克曼在热烈的气氛中向大会就党的发展作了报告，并且谈到目前的斗争。印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地和书记处书记苏蒂斯曼等党的领导人也出席了庆祝大会。
    参加庆祝大会的还有各党派、各社会团体和人民的代表。代表中有印度尼西亚国民党总主席苏维约、雅加达市长苏迪罗以及基督教党代表和国会议员们。许多人站在会议厅门外，或坐在门外的草地上倾听鲁克曼的演说。许多青年人从外面爬到会议厅的窗口高呼“印度尼西亚共产党万岁”。
    鲁克曼在演说中指出，印度尼西亚共产党在成立以来的三十八年中，虽然经历过许多失败和挫折，党始终是站在民族运动斗争的最前列。他还指出了印度尼西亚其他党派在民族解放运动中的贡献。
    鲁克曼谴责了那些企图破坏共产党的人和帝国主义干涉印度尼西亚的活动。他指出，有些人害怕帝国主义者，不敢清除叛乱集团。他说，只要政府采取明确的措施，加上人民的支持以及亚非国家和社会主义国家的支持，叛乱集团是必然要被消灭的。
    鲁克曼还驳斥了某些人企图以歪曲茉莉芬事件实质的办法来攻击印度尼西亚共产党。他说，印度尼西亚共产党在茉莉芬地方选举中获得的胜利表明，当地人民是信任共产党的。
