    Grasp This Year, Prepare for Next Year, Guarantee a Bountiful Harvest
    Tian Lianqian
    What is the role of summer harvest crops in agricultural production? We should have a unified and correct understanding of this issue.
    In the past, many people believed that summer harvest crops did not occupy a large planting area, the yield was not high, and they were not worth paying attention to. Therefore, they believed that summer harvest crops were insignificant in agricultural production. Precisely because of this reason, the planting area of summer harvest crops in some areas has been shrinking year by year. Obviously, this understanding is one-sided and wrong. Not to mention that people cannot do without the supply of wheat and oil crops in their daily lives, but even in terms of the annual grain output, summer harvest crops actually account for a certain proportion. If the harvest is not good, even if a bumper harvest is achieved in autumn, it will be difficult to compensate for the loss of the summer harvest.
    The summer harvest is an important part of the entire agricultural production. The relationship between summer harvest and autumn harvest is like the left and right hands of a person. The left hand is indeed not as important as the right hand, but when a person loses his left hand, he will feel great difficulties and become disabled. Therefore, it is a very meaningful and important thing to attach importance to summer production and guarantee a bountiful summer harvest.
    Summer harvest crops are not as low-yielding as some people think. Generally speaking: the yield of wheat is indeed not as high as that of rice and corn, but it is not impossible to increase it. Recently, haven't we often seen good news about high wheat yields in newspapers! Doesn't the record of high yields of 1,000 jin and 1,500 jin per mu already exist! Perhaps some people will say that there are too few high-yield fields and the conditions are different. Then please look at the facts in Huang County, Shandong. This county has more than 13,000 mu of wheat this year, and it is estimated that the yield per mu can reach 700 to 1,000 jin. In the face of such facts, shouldn't we take off the hat of low wheat yield? As for rapeseed and other summer harvest crops, their yields have been continuously increasing in the years since liberation, and the gap between high-yield records and average yields is also very large, sometimes several times or even more than ten times. These situations show that summer harvest crops are not inherently low-yielding crops; on the contrary, it shows that their potential for increased production is very large.
    So, how can we guarantee a bumper harvest of summer crops? From the facts of bumper harvests obtained in many regions this year, a very important factor is the selection of excellent varieties, the implementation of deep plowing and close planting, and rational fertilization. These tasks must be prepared before sowing. This means that in order to have a bumper harvest of summer crops next year, we must establish the idea of grasping this year and preparing for next year, and we must summarize the experience of high-yield, select enough excellent varieties, and prepare for winter sowing, deep plowing, close planting, etc. during this summer harvest.
    Now Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Anhui and other provinces have listed the preparation of winter sowing as an important part of the summer harvest and summer planting work. They have summarized the experience of this year's summer harvest through on-site meetings and launched a campaign to select fine varieties. This approach deserves great promotion.

    今年抓明年，丰收有保证
    田连阡
    夏收作物在农业生产中占什么样的地位？对这个问题应该有统一的正确的认识。
    过去，不少人认为夏收作物种植面积不算多，产量不大，不值得重视，因此认为夏收作物在农业生产中处于无足轻重的地位。正因为这个原因，有些地区夏收作物的种植面积在逐年缩小。显然，这种认识是片面的，错误的。且不说人们在日常生活中少不了麦类和油料的供应，就以全年粮食产量来看，事实上夏收作物也占着一定的比重，若是收成不好，尽管秋季得到大丰收，也难以补偿夏季少收的损失。
    夏收是整个农业生产的一个重要组成部分。夏收和秋收的关系，正如人的左右手一样。左手的确不如右手的作用大，可是当人失去了左手的时候，他就会感到很大的困难，同时也就成为残废者了。因此，重视夏季生产，保证夏季丰收，是一件很有意义的重要事情。
    夏收作物并不像某些人所认为的是低产作物。一般地说：麦子的确不如稻子和玉米的产量高，但它并不是不能提高的。最近，我们不是经常都可以在报纸上看到小麦高产的喜讯吗！亩产千斤、一千五……的丰产纪录不是已经出现了吗！也许有人还会说，丰产田数量太少，条件不同。那么请看山东黄县的事实吧，这个县今年有一万三千多亩小麦，预计每亩产量可达七百到一千斤。在这样的事实面前，我们难道还不该把小麦低产的帽子摘掉吗？至于油菜和其它夏收作物，解放几年来产量不断有所提高，而且高产纪录和平均产量之间的差距也很大，有的可以高几倍甚至十几倍。这些情况说明，夏收作物并不是天生的低产作物；相反，却是说明它的增产潜力很大。
    那么，怎样才能保证夏季作物丰收呢？从今年许多地区得到的丰收事实来看，一个很重要的因素——选用了优良品种，实行了深耕密植和合理施肥等，而这些工作是在播种前就要准备好的。这就是说，要想明年夏季作物大丰收，必须树立今年抓明年的思想，并在今年夏收的时候就要总结丰产经验，选好足够的优良品种，做好冬播规划和深耕、密植等等准备工作。
    现在山东、河南、湖北、河北、安徽等省已经把准备冬播工作列为夏收夏种工作中的一项重要内容。他们通过现场会议，总结了今年夏季丰收的经验，开展了精选良种运动。这种做法值得大大提倡。
