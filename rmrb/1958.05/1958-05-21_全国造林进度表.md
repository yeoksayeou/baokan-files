National Afforestation Progress Chart
According to the Ministry of Forestry's statistics on May 16 [Note] 1. The number of trees planted around houses and villages is less than the previous time, because Liaoning Province reported more than 400 million trees, which was mistakenly reported as more than 1 billion trees in the previous long-distance telephone call.
2. The afforestation area in Shaanxi Province is 6,989,500 mu, which was mistakenly reported as 9,689,500 mu last time. (Attached chart)

    全国造林进度表
    据林业部5月16日统计〔附注〕一、四旁植树数字，这次比上次少了，原因是辽宁省四亿多株，上次在长途电话中误为十亿多株。
    二、陕西省的造林是6，989，500亩，上次误为9，689，500亩。（附图表）
