Seeing the amazing progress of the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction project, I believe that under the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, relying on the people's high revolutionary enthusiasm, we will definitely be able to surpass the floods, block the floods, and race against time." He recited on the spot the verses he excitedly wrote after visiting the construction site: "Ten days of hard work, a lifetime of happiness, let Father Time offer us flowers, let the flood monsters wag their tails behind us. Let the Dragon King act as a servant: we tell him to do what, he dares not not do it."
