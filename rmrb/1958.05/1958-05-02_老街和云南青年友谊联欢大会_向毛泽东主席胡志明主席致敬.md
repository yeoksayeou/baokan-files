    Friendship Rally of Youths from Lao Cai and Yunnan Province
    Respectfully Salutes Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Ho Chi Minh

    (Our Dispatch) On May 1st, the youths of Yunnan Province, China and Lao Cai Province, Vietnam, held a solidarity and friendship rally in Hekou and Lao Cai. The conference sent telegrams to Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Ho Chi Minh to pay their respects. The telegram reads as follows: Respected Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Ho Chi Minh:

    On the occasion of the "May 1st" International Labor Day, we, the youths of Yunnan Province, China and Lao Cai Province, Vietnam, are holding a solidarity and friendship rally in Hekou, China and Lao Cai, Vietnam. We would like to extend our highest respect to you.

    We live in such a great and happy era that the strength of the socialist camp has surpassed that of the imperialist camp, and the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. Our common cause of socialism is advancing rapidly, and our future is bright and broad. In our struggle for socialism and peace, the youths on the border between our two countries will certainly unite closely, learn from each other, encourage each other, and support each other. Today, thousands of youths from the border provinces of our two countries are gathering together for a get-together, working together, and exchanging experiences. Our conference also issued a proposal to the youths of the two provinces to green the banks of the Red River and both sides of the railway, and the representatives have already planted the first batch of trees. We want to let the flowers of internationalist friendship bloom all over the borderlands of the two countries. We assure you that we will strengthen our exercises, study hard, work actively, and strive to build our own countries into prosperous and strong socialist countries.

    Yunnan Province, China and Lao Cai Province, Vietnam Youth Solidarity and Friendship Rally, May 1, 1958
