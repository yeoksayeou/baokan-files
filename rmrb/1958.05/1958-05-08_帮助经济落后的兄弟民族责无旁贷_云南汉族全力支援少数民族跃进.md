Helping economically backward ethnic minorities is our unshirkable duty.
Yunnan's Han people fully support the leap forward of ethnic minorities.

    (Report from our newspaper) The twenty ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province have received brotherly support and assistance from the Han people of the province in their socialist leap forward.
    Of Yunnan's more than 18 million people, ethnic minorities account for slightly less than one-third. They live in compact communities along the 4,000-kilometer border and in mixed communities throughout the province. The ethnic minority areas are rich in mineral resources. This year, ethnic minority areas will vigorously develop local industry from scratch. The four autonomous prefectures on the border and the special districts where ethnic minorities live in concentrated communities alone are preparing to build 655 small factories and mines this year. These factories and mines, from geological prospecting and design to construction, are being carried out with the help of Han technical personnel and skilled workers. The Kunming Institute of Technology has transferred dozens of teachers to form five working groups to help design hydropower stations in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture and the Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture; and to help design non-ferrous metal factories and mines and solve other technical problems in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture and the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture. Kunming's factories and mines, despite their extremely heavy production tasks this year, have still transferred a large number of technical personnel and various skilled workers to the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, and the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture to help build factories and help train new workers from ethnic minorities. Kunming's factories and mines are actively trying to provide the machinery and equipment needed by ethnic minority areas in their industrial development. Many enterprises have transferred some machine tools, generators, and other equipment from their warehouses and existing production equipment to support the Honghe, Chuxiong, Dali and other autonomous prefectures. While fulfilling state plans, Han workers in many factories are also trying to squeeze out time to produce machinery and equipment needed by ethnic minority areas.
    Agriculture is the main economy of Yunnan's ethnic minorities. In the past, ethnic minority areas on the border were backward in production. This year, they are leaping forward at an astonishing rate. In the border areas, where "slash-and-burn" farming was still common not long ago, the irrigated area under water conservancy construction this year averages one mu per person. In order to help the various ethnic minorities with the difficulties in manpower, technology, and production tools that have arisen in the large-scale production campaign, in addition to the 5 million yuan in subsidies that the state has already allocated to ethnic minorities on the border to solve the economic difficulties in the production leap forward, Yunnan Province has also sent thousands of Han cadres and technicians to the border areas to establish state farms or work in the border areas, bringing advanced production technology to the ethnic minorities. The Kawa people living on the southwestern border had no experience when they built their first reservoir in history on Ximeng Mountain, which is more than 2,000 meters above sea level this year. The Yunnan Provincial Water Conservancy Department sent two technicians to Ximeng Mountain, traveling thousands of miles, to help the Kawa people design the reservoir and improve transportation tools. The Han cadres working on Ximeng Mountain worked side by side with the Kawa people. The Kawa people could not blast rocks or do stonework. More than a dozen Han stoneworkers who came to support them from the interior of Yunnan taught the Kawa people the technique of blasting rocks by the method of master teaching apprentice, and helped them train stoneworkers. Many Han employees in the commercial sector ventured into the sparsely populated remote areas and high-altitude mountainous areas, delivering the means of production and consumer goods needed by the ethnic minorities to their doorsteps, and purchasing various wild plants and local specialties on the spot. In Cangyuan County, where the Kawa people live in concentrated communities, employees of the commercial sector organized more than 20 peddlers to carry goods to the Kawa people's tribes and villages in the high mountains and deep forests, saving the Kawa people the time they used to spend traveling long distances to buy things, and effectively supporting agricultural production there.

    帮助经济落后的兄弟民族责无旁贷
    云南汉族全力支援少数民族跃进
    本报讯　云南省的二十个少数民族在向社会主义跃进中，得到全省汉族人民兄弟般的支援和帮助。
    在云南一千八百多万人口中，少数民族占三分之一弱，他们聚居在绵延四千公里的边疆和杂居在全省各地。各少数民族地区蕴藏着异常丰富的矿产资源。今年，少数民族地区要从无到有地大兴地方工业，仅边疆四个自治州和少数民族聚居的专区今年就准备建设六百五十五座小型厂矿。这些厂矿从地质勘探、设计到建设都是在汉族技术人员和技术工人帮助下进行的。昆明工学院抽调了几十名教师组成五个工作组，分别到西双版纳傣族自治州和文山僮族苗族自治州去帮助设计水电站；到德宏傣族景颇族自治州和红河哈尼族彝族自治州等地帮助设计有色金属厂矿及解决其它技术问题。昆明市各厂矿在今年生产任务极为繁重的情况下，仍抽调了大批技术人员和各种技术工人到大理白族自治州、楚雄彝族自治州、红河哈尼族彝族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州等地去帮助建厂，并帮助培养训练少数民族的新工人。少数民族地区在大兴工业中需要的机器设备，昆明市各厂矿都积极想办法支援，许多企业已从清理仓库中和从现有生产设备中，抽调了一部分机床、发电机及其它器材设备支援红河、楚雄、大理等自治州。许多工厂的汉族工人在完成国家计划的同时，还尽量挤出时间生产少数民族地区需要的机器设备。
    农业是云南少数民族的主要经济。过去，边疆少数民族生产落后，今年他们正以惊人的速度跃进。不久前还普遍用“刀耕火种”方式生产的边疆地区，今年兴修水利的灌溉面积，平均每人一亩。为了帮助各少数民族在大规模生产运动中出现的人力、技术和生产工具方面的若干困难，除国家已拨五百万元补助费给边疆少数民族解决生产跃进中的经济困难外，云南省还派出了数以千计的汉族干部和技术人员到边疆地区建立国营农场或到边疆工作，把先进的生产技术带给少数民族。居住在西南边境的佧佤人，今年在拔海两千多公尺的西盟山上兴修历史上的第一座水库时，没有一点经验，云南省水利部门派了两个技术人员跋涉千里到西盟山，帮助佧佤人设计水库，改良运输工具。在西盟山工作的汉族干部同佧佤人并肩劳动。佧佤人不会爆破石头和作石工，从云南内地来支援的十多个汉族石工用师傅带徒弟的办法，教会了佧佤人爆破石头的技术，帮助他们培养出石工。商业部门的许多汉族职工不避艰险地深入地广人稀的边远地区和高寒山区，把少数民族需要的生产资料和生活用品送上门去，并就地收购各种野生植物和土特产。在佧佤人聚居的沧源县，商业部门的职工组织了二十多个货郎担，挑到高山深林中佧佤人的部落和村寨，节省了佧佤人过去跑很远去买东西的时间，有力支援了那里的农业生产。
