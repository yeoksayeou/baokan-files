　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th (TASS): The Soviet government, in a note, drew the Japanese government's attention to the fact that news about the deployment of nuclear weapons in Japan, as well as aircraft and rockets carrying and launching nuclear weapons, has caused understandable anxiety among the Soviet people, because these measures by Japan would pose a threat to peace and security in the Far East, and the Soviet Union cannot ignore this situation.
    The Soviet government's note was delivered to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 15th by Zabroдин, the Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Soviet Embassy in Japan.
    The note said that the Soviet government was pleased to learn of the Japanese government's statement welcoming the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapons tests, as well as the Japanese government's assurance that Japan "sincerely hopes that atomic energy will only be used for peaceful purposes." However, there is a contradiction between these assurances by the Japanese government and the news in Japanese newspapers about the deployment of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon launching tools in Japan. The note pointed out that the authorities have not refuted the above-mentioned news in Japanese newspapers. It is clear that this news is well-founded.
    The note expressed the hope that the Japanese government would clarify whether the claim that nuclear weapons and nuclear weapon launching tools have been transported into Japanese territory is in accordance with the actual situation.

    苏联政府照会日本政府
　　日本储存核武器威胁远东安全
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联政府在一份照会中提请日本政府注意，关于在日本境内设有核武器以及载运和发射核武器的飞机和火箭的消息引起了苏联人民的可以理解的焦虑，因为日本的这些措施会造成对和平和远东安全的威胁，苏联不能忽视这种情况。
    苏联政府的这份照会已经在15日由苏联驻日本大使馆临时代办扎布罗金交给日本外务省。
    照会说，苏联政府满意地获悉了日本政府关于它欢迎苏联单方面停止试验原子武器和氢武器的声明，以及日本政府表示日本“衷心希望原子能只用于和平目的”的保证。但是，日本报纸上关于日本境内设有核武器和发射核武器的工具的消息同日本政府的这种保证之间有了矛盾。照会指出，官方没有对日本报纸的上述消息辟谣。可见这些消息是有根据的。
    照会表示希望日本政府说明，关于有核武器和发射核武器的工具运入日本领土的说法是否合乎实际情况。
