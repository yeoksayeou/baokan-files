    Planting Fruit Trees on Idle Land in Courtyards
    "Apples knock heads, pears cover the ground, Fengshi Village turns into a garden of flowers and fruits." This is the slogan put forward by the members of Xinfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Yongfeng Township, Pucheng County, Shaanxi Province when they planted fruit trees and greened the village two years ago, and it has now been basically realized. This cooperative, originally called Fengshi Village, has a total of one hundred and forty households. Before liberation, there were only a small number of jujube, peach, apricot, persimmon trees and other economic forests. After liberation, especially after cooperativization, under the leadership of the local Party and People's Government, after several years of hard work, the cooperative has developed more than 4,000 fruit trees and Chinese prickly ash trees of various types, more than twenty times the number before liberation, averaging thirty-three trees per household, truly resembling a large orchard when viewed from afar. In 1957, the total output of various fruits reached more than 17,000 catties, worth more than 3,000 yuan.
    These fruit trees and Chinese prickly ash trees, in addition to more than 2,000 trees collectively managed by the cooperative and planted on the slopes of the gullies, the remaining more than 2,000 trees owned privately by the members are planted in the courtyards and vacant land outside the courtyards. No matter where you go, to which door or courtyard, there are several, a dozen, or even dozens of fruit trees. Planting fruit trees and other economic trees in villages and courtyards has several advantages: First, it makes full use of idle land and saves cultivated land. Second, it both greens and beautifies the village and increases the sideline income of the cooperative members' families, while also providing fruit to eat regularly. Third, it does not require sending people to manage them specifically, as they can be nurtured and managed well by using spare time after rain, during slack seasons, before meals, and after meals.
    The reason why this cooperative has developed fruit trees quickly is mainly because the Party branch and the management committee of the cooperative attach importance to leadership and have accurately identified that planting fruit trees on idle land in villages and courtyards is a good direction. In 1955, when the advanced cooperative was established in the village, it called on members to plant trees in every household, and organized experienced old farmers to teach members grafting and planting techniques, which led to the popularization of fruit tree planting. Now, on average, every household in the cooperative has one person who knows grafting and management techniques, and almost every household cultivates seedlings, which are not only enough for their own use but also sell hundreds of seedlings every year.
    If every village and every household makes use of the idle land in villages and courtyards to plant fruit trees, this will be a very large income for the state and the peasants. It is hoped that all localities will promote the experience of this cooperative.

### 利用院内闲地栽果树

    利用院内闲地栽果树
    “苹果碰头梨打面，凤式村变花果园”。这是陕西省蒲城县永丰乡新丰农业社的社员们在两年前栽种果树、绿化村庄时提出的口号，现在已经基本实现了。这个社，原来叫凤式村，共有一百四十户，解放前只有为数不多的枣、桃、杏、柿树和其他经济林木；解放后，特别是合作化以后，他们在当地党和人民政府的领导下，经过几年来的辛勤劳动，全社各类果树和花椒树已经发展到四千多棵，超过解放前二十多倍，平均每户三十三棵，远看确实像是一个大果园。1957年，各种果子的总产量已达一万七千多斤，价值三千多元。
    这些果树和花椒树，除了社内集体经营的两千多棵是种在沟坡地里以外，其余社员私有的两千多棵都是种在院内、院外空闲地上的。无论走到那家门前、院内，都有几棵、十几棵以至数十棵果树。村庄、院内栽种果树和其他经济林木，有几个好处：第一，充分利用了闲地，节省耕地。第二，既绿化和美化了村庄，又增加了社员家庭副业收入，同时还可经常吃到果子。第三，不用派人专门经营，利用雨后、农闲、饭前、饭后等空闲休息时间就抚育经管好了。
    这个社果树发展快的原因，主要是党支部和社的管理委员会重视领导，看准了利用村庄、院内的闲地栽培果树是个好方向。1955年村内成立高级社，就号召社员家家栽种，组织有务果树经验的老农教给员社嫁接、培技栽术，这才形成了栽种果树的风气。现在全社平均每户有一个人会嫁接、管理技术，差不多每户都育有幼苗，不仅够本社自己使用，而且每年还要出卖几百棵树苗。
    如果村村户户都利用村内、院内闲地栽植果树，这将是国家和农民的一批很大收入。希望各地都来推广这个社的经验。
