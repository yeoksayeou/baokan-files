    The cadres of the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Yangzhuang Township, Baoding, are busy arranging the specific work for secondary school graduates coming to the cooperative for agricultural production during the summer vacation. Someone suggested: These young people are used to being active and lively in school. Let's set up some basketball hoops and let them play basketball after work. This will not only enrich their cultural life and boost their production enthusiasm but also drive all the young people in the cooperative to engage in sports activities.
    The cooperative adopted this suggestion. Soon, basketball hoops and courts were set up, and the "Farmer-Soldier" basketball team, composed of four students, two demobilized soldiers, and several other young farmers, was born. After a short period of practice, they held friendly matches with the youths of Yangzhuang, Donggaozhuang, and other production teams in the cooperative. The competition greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of young people to participate in sports activities, and drove the production teams of Kanggzhuang and others to establish teams or other sports activity groups, and promoted the development of sports throughout the cooperative.
    The "Farmer-Soldier" is a very formalized basketball team, with a captain and technical guidance. There are specific plans for practice, studying tactics, and competitions. They never delay production because of training and competition. Whenever there is a game, they contact the production team leader several days in advance and require the team members participating in the game to complete their production tasks in advance to compensate for the time taken up by the game. This not only ensures that the team members' personal family income is not harmed, but also gains the active support of the production team leader and the masses.

　　一个农民篮球队
　　傅文茂
    保定杨庄乡红星农业社的干部，正忙着暑期中学毕业生来社参加农业生产的具体安排工作。有人建议：这些年青人在学校里活蹦乱跳惯了，弄副篮球架子，让他们在劳动后玩玩篮球，这样不仅能丰富文化生活，鼓舞他们的生产情绪，而且还可借以带动全社青年把体育运动搞起来。
    社里采纳了这个建议。不久，篮球架、场地就都搞好了，由四个学生两个复员军人和另外几个青年农民组成的“农战”篮球队诞生了。他们经过短期练习，先后同本社的杨庄、东高庄等生产队的青年进行了友谊比赛。竞赛活动大大激发了青年参加体育活动的积极性，带动了康各庄等生产队也建立球队或其他体育活动小组，并推动了全社体育运动的开展。
    “农战”这支新生的农村篮球队是一个很正规化的球队，有队长、技术指导。练习、研究战术、比赛等都有具体计划。他们从不因为练球和赛球耽误生产。每遇比赛，在几天前就同生产队长联系好，并要求参加比赛的球队员提前完成生产任务，以弥补球赛占用的时间。这样既使球队员的个人家庭收入不受损害，而且也能得到生产队长和群众的积极支持。
