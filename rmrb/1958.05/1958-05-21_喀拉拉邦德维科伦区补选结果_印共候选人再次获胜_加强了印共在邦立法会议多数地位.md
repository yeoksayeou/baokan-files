Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 20 - In the recent election in the Devikulam constituency of Kerala, led by the Communist Party of India, the CPI, after fierce competition, defeated the Congress Party, adding a seat to the State Legislative Assembly, thereby strengthening its majority in the state legislature.

The Communist Party of India candidate, Mrs. Ponnamma, was elected in this election. She is a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of India and Chairman of the Kerala Plantation Workers' Union. According to official figures, she received 55,819 votes. Her main competitor, Congress Party candidate, Mr. Nair, a leader of the All India Trade Union Congress in Kerala, received 48,730 votes.

Devikulam is the largest constituency in Kerala. It is reported that about 70% of the 160,000 people in this constituency voted. Two-thirds of the people in this constituency are plantation workers, and most of these plantations are foreign-owned.

This election is considered an important event in India's current political life. Delhi newspapers believe that the results of this election show that the people of Kerala approve and support the policies implemented by the Communist-led government in the past year. With Mrs. Ponnamma's election, the Communist Party now has 65 seats in the 127-seat Kerala Legislative Assembly (including the speaker who is a Communist), while the opposition parties have 62 seats.

In the Indian general election held at the beginning of last year, Mrs. Ponnamma, the Communist Party of India candidate, had already been elected in the Devikulam constituency. At that time, the Communist Party of India had 65 seats in the Legislative Assembly, while the opposition parties, including the Congress Party and the People's Socialist Party, had 62 seats. Later, at the request of the Congress Party candidate in the Devikulam constituency, the election tribunal declared the election that had already been held invalid "on technical grounds" and ordered a re-election. As a result, the number of seats supporting the Communist Party of India in the Legislative Assembly was reduced to 64. Excluding the speaker who is a Communist Party member, the two sides differed by only one seat.

In this election, Mrs. Ponnamma continued to participate in the election as a candidate of the Communist Party of India. The Congress Party changed its candidate to Mr. Nair, the leader of its Kerala trade union. The Congress Party had made every effort to conduct an in-depth campaign. Congress Party President Dhebar and Prime Minister Nehru's daughter, Mrs. Indira Gandhi, and several Congress Party cabinet ministers visited Kerala to support the Congress Party's campaign. Congress Party members went door-to-door to persuade people to support their candidates. At the same time, the Congress Party candidate also received the support of the People's Socialist Party and the Muslim League in this state. The supporters of the Communist Party of India also conducted active campaigns for their candidates. According to the decision of the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India, in order to ensure that the state government under the leadership of the Communist Party can hold this election freely and fairly, the ministers of this state did not participate in this campaign.

On May 20, newspapers in New Delhi published the news of the election results in the Devikulam constituency of Kerala on the front page and published a photo of Mrs. Ponnamma.

### 喀拉拉邦德维科伦区补选结果  印共候选人再次获胜  加强了印共在邦立法会议多数地位

    喀拉拉邦德维科伦区补选结果
    印共候选人再次获胜
    加强了印共在邦立法会议多数地位
    新华社新德里20日电　印度共产党在它领导的喀拉拉邦德维科伦选区最近举行的选举中，经过激烈的竞争以后战胜了国大党，在邦立法会议中增加了一个议席，从而加强了自己在邦立法机构中的多数地位。
    印度共产党候选人彭诺斯夫人在这次选举中当选。她是印度共产党全国委员会委员、喀拉拉邦种植园工会主席。据官方公布的数字，她得到五万五千八百十九票。她的主要竞争者国大党候选人、印度全国工会大会喀拉拉邦领导人奈尔得到四万八千七百三十票。
    德维科伦是喀拉拉邦最大的选区。据报道，在这个选区的十六万人口中有70％左右的人投了票。这个选区内有三分之二的人是种植园工人，这些种植园多数是外国人所有的。
    这次选举被认为是印度目前政治生活中的一个重要事件。德里报界人士认为，这次选举的结果表明，喀拉拉邦人民赞同和拥护共产党领导的政府在过去一年内所执行的政策。由于彭诺斯夫人当选，现在在喀拉拉邦立法会议的一百二十七席中，支持共产党的共有六十五席，（包括共产党人担任的议长在内），反对党议员六十二席。
    在去年初举行的印度大选中，印度共产党候选人彭诺斯夫人本来已经在德维科伦选区当选。当时，在立法会议中，支持印度共产党的就是六十五席，包括国大党和人民社会党在内的反对党派是六十二席。后来由于德维科伦选区国大党候选人的要求，选举法庭“根据技术上的原因”，宣布已经举行的选举无效，并且命令重新进行选举。这样一来，在立法会议中支持印度共产党的议席就减为六十四席。如不包括由印度共产党人担任的议长在内，双方议员席位只相差一席。
    在这一次举行的选举中，彭诺斯夫人继续作为印度共产党候选人参加竞选。国大党改提它的喀拉拉邦工会领袖奈尔参加竞选。国大党曾经尽一切力量进行深入的竞选运动。国大党主席德巴和尼赫鲁总理的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人和几位国大党内阁部长都访问了喀拉拉邦，支持国大党的竞选运动。国大党员们曾经挨家挨户地劝人支持他们的候选人。同时，国大党候选人还得到人民社会党和这个邦的穆斯林联盟的支持。印度共产党的支持者也曾经为他们的候选人进行了活跃的竞选运动。根据印度共产党喀拉拉邦委员会的决定，为了保证在共产党领导下的邦政府能够自由公正地举行这次选举，这个邦的部长们都没有参加这次竞选活动。
    新德里各报20日都在首版刊登了喀拉拉邦德维科伦选区选举结果的消息，并且刊登了彭诺斯夫人的照片。
