On a street, a light yellow bus was driving quickly. Suddenly, a football flew out from a doorway, followed by a boy chasing the ball who ran to the bus's wheels. Fortunately, the bus braked immediately. Pedestrians breathed a sigh of relief for the child who had escaped danger. Everyone walked to the bus, eager to see the agile driver. But, strangely, there was no driver in the car, not even a steering wheel! Passengers sat as if in an ordinary bus, some reading and some talking.

This car, closing the door and driving itself, opening the door and stopping itself, capable of detouring around obstacles, and able to automatically brake in an emergency if someone touched the wheels, even pushing the person aside. This car has a very good "memory"; it stopped when it saw a red light, and continued forward when the green light turned on.

It turns out this is an "automatic car," trial-produced by students from the Ponch-Bruevich Institute of Transport Electrical Engineering in Leningrad, under the leadership of an engineer. Replacing the driver's labor is an operating system composed of photoelectric tubes, electron tubes, positioners, and other components. This car has not yet been driven on city streets, but the above-mentioned scenarios can be seen during model experiments in the institute's laboratory. (Fang)

    无人驾驶的汽车试验成功
    在一条大街上有一辆淡黄色的公共汽车在迅速行驶着。突然，从一家门口飞出来了一个足球，随后一个追球的少年飞跑到汽车轮旁，幸而汽车立刻刹住了。行路人都为这个脱险的孩子松了口气，大家走到汽车旁边都想看看这位敏捷的司机同志。可是，真奇怪，汽车里没有一个司机，连驾驶盘都没有！乘客们像坐在普通的公共汽车里一样，有的在看书，有的在交谈。
    这辆汽车，门一关自己就走，门一开自己就停住，遇到障碍物可以绕道而行，如果有人碰上车轮，能够自动紧急刹车，并且还能把这个人推到一边去。这辆汽车的“记忆力”非常好，它看到红灯就停住了，绿灯一亮，又继续前进。
    原来这是一辆“自动汽车”，它是列宁格勒蓬奇—布卢也维奇交通电工学院的学生们在一位工程师领导下试制出来的。代替司机劳动的是一套由光电管、电子管、定位器等组成的操作系统。这辆汽车在市内大街上还没有行驶过，但是上述情节在学院的试验大厅里进行模型试验时是可以看到的。　　（方）
