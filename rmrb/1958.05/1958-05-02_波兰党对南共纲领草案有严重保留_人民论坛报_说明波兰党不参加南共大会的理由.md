Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, 29th: The Polish "People's Tribune" recently published an editorial commenting on the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and stated the valid reasons why the Polish United Workers' Party did not send a delegation to attend the Yugoslav Communist Congress.

The editorial argues that the draft program of the Yugoslav Communists, particularly on issues such as views on the development of the modern world, the origin and nature of the division of the world into two major blocs, the essence of relations between socialist countries, the role of state capitalism and the state in imperialist countries, the process of state withering away, national characteristics and the universal laws of socialist construction, has caused serious reservations on the part of the Polish United Workers' Party. The editorial also mentioned that the content of the draft program goes far beyond issues concerning only Yugoslavia, which cannot but arouse substantive reservations from other communist and workers' parties, including the Polish United Workers' Party. Therefore, the Polish United Workers' Party decided not to send a delegation to attend the Yugoslav Communist Congress.

    波兰党对南共纲领草案有严重保留
    “人民论坛报”说明波兰党不参加南共大会的理由
    新华社华沙29日电　波兰“人民论坛报”不久前发表社论，评论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会，并且表明了波兰统一工人党不派遣代表团参加南共大会的正确理由。
    社论认为，南共纲领草案中，特别是关于这样的一些问题，例如对现代世界发展的看法、世界分成两大集团的根源和性质、社会主义国家关系的本质、帝国主义国家中国家资本主义和国家的作用、国家消亡的过程、民族特点和社会主义建设的普遍规律，引起了波兰统一工人党的严重保留。社论还谈到，纲领草案的内容远远超出了只涉及南斯拉夫的问题，这不能不引起其他共产党和工人党的实质上的保留，其中也包括波兰统一工人党。因此，波兰统一工人党决定不派遣代表团参加南共的代表大会。
