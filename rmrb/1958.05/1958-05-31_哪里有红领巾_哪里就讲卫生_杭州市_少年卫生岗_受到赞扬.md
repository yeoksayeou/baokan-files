Wherever There are Young Pioneers, There is Cleanliness
Hangzhou's "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squad" Receives Praise

(Our Dispatch) This reporter, Tu Zhengfeng, reports: In Hangzhou, the young children have established "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squads." The children actively participate in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases and promote hygiene. Their activities have received praise from the people.

The action slogan of the "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squad" is: "Wherever there are Young Pioneers, there are Young Pioneer Hygiene Squads," "Wherever there are Young Pioneer Hygiene Squads, there are no traces of spitting." The Young Pioneers, unafraid of the scorching sun or heavy rain, always guard their posts with boundless enthusiasm, watching every passerby. When they see someone spitting, they step forward and politely dissuade them. Many Young Pioneers also take out paper to wipe away the sputum on the ground, or hand paper to those who are sick and need to spit. Their serious and responsible attitude has been praised by the masses, and literary and art workers have also used the deeds of the "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squad" as creative material.

In the past two months, the organization of "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squads" in Hangzhou has grown to more than 4,500, with more than 50,000 children participating. According to statistics from the Xiacheng and Gongshu districts alone, more than 88,000 person-times of publicity have been carried out, and more than 3 million person-times have been educated and dissuaded. Now, when residents of the city walk on the streets, they rarely spit or litter fruit peels and paper scraps, and many basically sputum-free streets and sputum-free alleys have appeared.

The activities of the "Young Pioneer Hygiene Squad" have also educated the Young Pioneers themselves. They have not only enhanced their awareness of serving the public welfare, but also changed their own unhygienic habits. Generally, the Young Pioneers have developed hygienic habits of paying attention to hygiene, loving cleanliness, washing their faces, bathing, and changing clothes frequently. Children who used to have nicknames such as "Mud Gourd" and "Painted Face" now also love cleanliness.

### 哪里有红领巾　哪里就讲卫生  杭州市“少年卫生岗”受到赞扬

    哪里有红领巾　哪里就讲卫生
    杭州市“少年卫生岗”受到赞扬
    本报讯　记者屠正峰报道：杭州市少年儿童建立了“少年卫生岗”，孩子们积极参加除害灭病、讲卫生运动，他们的活动受到人们的赞扬。
    “少年卫生岗”的行动口号是：“哪里有红领巾，哪里就有少年卫生岗”，“哪里有少年卫生岗，哪里就没有痰迹”。少先队员们不怕烈日、暴雨，始终以无比的热情严守着自己的岗位，注视着每一个行人。他们见到吐痰的人，就上前有礼貌地劝阻，不少的少先队员还掏纸擦去地上的痰迹，或递纸给有病的人吐痰。他们这种认真负责的态度受到广大群众的赞扬，文艺工作者还将“少年卫生岗”的事迹作为创作题材。
    两个多月来，杭州市“少年卫生岗”的组织已发展到四千五百多个，参加的少年儿童达五万多人。仅据下城、拱墅两区统计：共出动宣传八万八千多人次，受到宣传和劝阻的达三百多万人次。全市居民现在走到街上，很少随地吐痰和随地乱丢果壳、纸屑，并且出现了许多基本无痰街和无痰巷。
    “少年卫生岗”的活动也教育了少年儿童自己。他们不仅增强了为社会公共事业服务的观念，而且也改变了自己不讲卫生的坏习惯。一般少年儿童已养成了讲卫生、爱清洁、勤洗脸、洗澡、换衣服的卫生习惯；过去有“泥冬瓜”、“大花脸”等绰号的孩子们，现在也爱清洁了。
