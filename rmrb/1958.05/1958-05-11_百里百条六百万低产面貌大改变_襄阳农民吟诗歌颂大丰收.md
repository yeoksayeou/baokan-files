"Hundreds of Li of Channels Transform Low-Yield Land, Creating Six Million Mu of Farmland"
Xiangyang Farmers Sing Praises of the Bumper Harvest

It is already certain that Xiangyang region in Hubei province will have an unprecedented summer crop harvest. Farmers are sharpening their sickles and repairing their vehicles, actively preparing for the harvest, and at the same time, they are excitedly singing the praises of the bumper harvest.

An old man with weathered features in Gucheng County, seeing the golden wheat waves undulating in the wheat fields, with large ears and abundant grains, capable of yielding thousands of catties per mu, was deeply moved and spontaneously composed a doggerel, singing:

"This old man is over sixty,
I've seen two or three emperors;
Each mu yields over a thousand catties of wheat,
I've never seen such a good year!"

Xiangyang Prefecture is mostly mountainous, with barren soil and very low crop yields. Farmers mostly relied on coarse grains as their staple food, and it was never easy to eat fine grains. However, due to the large-scale water conservancy projects undertaken last winter, this area has begun to transform into a granary, shedding the label of "low-yield in northern Hubei." Farmers Bai Yutang and Chen Chaowu in Xiangyang County, witnessing the abundant wheat harvest, were extremely excited and spontaneously sang:

"The power of the cooperative is strong,
Everywhere is a new atmosphere;
A thousand years of sweet potato soup,
Transformed into fragrant rice and noodles."

Farmers Li Yudong and Xiao Yiyi, seeing their hometown transformed, sang:

"Hundreds of Li of channels, six million mu,
The face of low-yield land has greatly changed;
Northern Xiangyang no longer eats sweet potato soup,
Northern Hubei will henceforth become a rice granary."

(Note: "Hundreds of Li of channels, six million mu" refers to the hundred long channels built in Xiangyang Prefecture last winter, which can guarantee a bumper harvest on six million mu of grain. "Northern Xiangyang" refers to the mountainous area in the northern part of Xiangyang Prefecture).

People are more grateful in times of joy. When celebrating the bumper harvest, the people of Xiangyang region cherish the memory of their beloved leader, Chairman Mao, even more. They use the following verses to express their feelings:

"Chairman Mao, oh Chairman Mao, when we pick up our rice bowls, we think of you. In the past, we ate three meals of sweet potatoes, but now we eat meat and rice.

Chairman Mao, oh Chairman Mao, when we cover ourselves with quilts, we think of you. In the past, we covered ourselves with greasy rags, but now we cover ourselves with new cotton quilts.

Chairman Mao, oh Chairman Mao, when the grain is abundant, we think of you. In the past, we farmed for landlords, but now we farm for ourselves.

Chairman Mao, oh Chairman Mao, when we pick up our rice bowls, we think of you, when we go to bed, we think of you, we miss you day and night."

(Note: "Three meals of sweet potatoes" refers to eating sweet potatoes three times a day; "greasy rags" refers to quilts that were as tattered as greasy rags.)

### “百里百条六百万低产面貌大改变”  襄阳农民吟诗歌颂大丰收

　　“百里百条六百万低产面貌大改变”
    襄阳农民吟诗歌颂大丰收
    湖北襄阳地区夏季作物空前丰收已成定局，农民们一面磨镰修车，积极准备收割；一面十分兴奋地歌颂大丰收。
    谷城县一位饱经风霜的老人，看到麦地里金黄色的麦浪随风起伏，麦穗大，籽粒多，每亩能产千斤，深深感动，随口作了一首打油诗，唱道：
    “老汉今年六十多，
    皇帝见过两三个；
    每亩产麦千斤多，
    这好的年景没见过！”
    襄阳专区多山岭，土质贫瘠，农作物产量很低，农民大多拿杂粮作主食，一向不容易吃到细粮。但是，由于去年冬天大兴水利，这里开始变成谷仓，摘掉了“鄂北低产”的帽子。襄阳县农民白玉堂和陈超五眼看着麦子丰收，心情非常兴
    奋，顺口唱道：
    “合作社的力量强，
    到处一片新气象；
    千年红薯糊涂汤，
    一变米面喷喷香。”
    农民李玉东、萧以义看到自己的家乡变了样，唱道：
    “百里百条六百万，
    低产面貌大改变；
    三北不吃红薯汤，
    鄂北从今成米仓。”
    （注，百里百条六百万指襄阳专区去冬修起一百条百里长渠，可以保证六百万亩粮食丰收，三北指襄阳专区北部山区）。
    人逢喜事倍思亲。襄阳地区人民在庆丰收的时候，更加怀念敬爱的领袖毛主席。他们用这样的诗句唱出自己的心情：
    “毛主席呀毛主席，端起饭碗想起你，往年吃的三红传，如今吃的肉和米。
    毛主席呀毛主席，盖起被子想起您，往年盖的猪油渣，现在盖的新棉絮。
    毛主席呀毛主席，粮食丰收想起您，往年种田为地主，现在种田为自己。
    毛主席呀毛主席，端起饭碗想起你，上床睡觉想起你，日日夜夜想念你。”
    （注：三红传是指一天吃三顿红薯而言；盖的猪油渣指被子像猪油渣一样的破烂。）
