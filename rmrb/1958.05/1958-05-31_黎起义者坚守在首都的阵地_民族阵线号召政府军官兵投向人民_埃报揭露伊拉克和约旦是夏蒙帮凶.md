Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 30th - It is reported that the insurgent people of the Basta district of Beirut, the Lebanese capital, repelled another fierce attack on the morning of the 29th by the pro-Western government-controlled armed forces, holding the ground they have completely controlled for more than ten days.

The Basta district is a Muslim residential area. Since the insurgents took control of this area more than ten days ago, the government has launched several attacks, all of which have been repelled by the resolute resistance of the insurgents.

According to a report by "Radio Free Lebanon" on the morning of the 29th, the Lebanese National Front issued an appeal to Lebanese officers and soldiers on the 28th, calling on them to join the people's forces fighting for freedom and sovereignty. The appeal said: "We have launched a fierce battle against imperialism and its agent, Chamoun; you must remember that the Lebanese are your brothers and descendants, and we do not believe that you will kill them simply because of a single order from Chamoun."

On the same day, the National Front also issued another appeal calling on the people to continue the struggle against all evil forces.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 29th - "Al-Ahram" reported on the 29th that during the secret meeting between the Kings of Iraq and Jordan and Lebanese President Chamoun on May 24 in Zarka, Jordan, they expressed their willingness to help Chamoun suppress the uprising of the Lebanese people.

The newspaper said that Chamoun told the two kings that the nationalist movement in Lebanon must be decisively struck, because if this movement were to succeed in Lebanon, it would encourage similar movements in Iraq and Jordan to succeed.

The newspaper also said that as a result, eight planes loaded with weapons left Amman for Beirut the next day, and on May 26, another half-battalion of Jordanian soldiers, accompanied by officers of the Jordanian Royal Guard, flew from Amman to Beirut to participate in the suppression of the Lebanese people.

"Al-Ahram" also reported that three large planes carrying Iraqi soldiers had arrived in Beirut. The soldiers were wearing civilian clothes when they got off the plane, but then changed into Lebanese police uniforms.

    黎起义者坚守在首都的阵地
    民族阵线号召政府军官兵投向人民
    埃报揭露伊拉克和约旦是夏蒙帮凶
    据新华社大马士革30日电　据报道，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特巴斯塔区起义人民，在29日清晨又打退了亲西方政府控制的武装力量的一次猛烈进攻，坚守住十几天来完全由他们控制的阵地。
    巴斯塔区是穆斯林居住地区。自从起义人民在十几天前控制这个地区以来，尽管政府方面发动多次进攻，结果都被坚决反击的起义者打退。
    据“自由黎巴嫩电台”29日上午报道，黎巴嫩民族阵线在28日曾经发表一项致黎巴嫩军官和士兵的呼吁书，号召他们加入争取自由和主权的人民部队。呼吁书说：“我们已经对帝国主义和它的代理人夏蒙展开了严酷的战斗；你们必须记住，黎巴嫩人是你们的兄弟和后代，我们不相信你们仅仅因为有夏蒙的一纸命令就会杀害他们。”
    民族阵线在同一天还发表另一项呼吁书，号召人民继续对一切罪恶势力展开斗争。
    据新华社开罗29日电　“金字塔报”29日报道，伊拉克和约旦的国王5月24日在约旦的扎尔卡城同黎巴嫩总统夏蒙举行的秘密会谈中，表示将帮助夏蒙镇压黎巴嫩人民的起义。
    这家报纸说，夏蒙告诉这两个国王说，必须对黎巴嫩的民族主义运动给予决定性打击，因为如果这个运动在黎巴嫩取得胜利，就会助长伊拉克和约旦的类似运动取得胜利。
    这家报纸又说，因此，在第二天就有八架满载武器的飞机离开安曼前往贝鲁特，而且在5月26日，又有半营约旦士兵在约旦王家卫队的军官陪同下从安曼飞往贝鲁特，参加镇压黎巴嫩人民。
    “金字塔报”还报道，有三架载运伊拉克士兵的大型飞机已经到达贝鲁特。这些士兵从飞机上下来时都穿着便服，但是随后就换上了黎巴嫩警察的制服。
