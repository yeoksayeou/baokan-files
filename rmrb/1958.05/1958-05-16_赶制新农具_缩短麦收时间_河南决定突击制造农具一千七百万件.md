Rushing to Produce New Farm Tools to Shorten Wheat Harvesting Time

Henan Decides on Emergency Production of 17 Million Farm Tools

(Our report) The Henan Province convened a wheat harvest and summer planting farm tool manufacturing conference from May 10th to 12th. The conference demanded that all localities rapidly organize all possible technical forces and work hard for fifteen days and nights to rush to produce 7.2 million new-style harvesting and threshing wheat harvesting tools, and 10 million light transportation vehicles. It also demanded that the potential of existing old-style farm tools be fully utilized to improve labor efficiency, shorten the wheat harvest and summer planting time, and ensure the successful completion of the wheat harvest and summer planting tasks.

The conference gathered drawings and models of new wheat harvesting tools created in various localities, and displayed more than 30 kinds of new-style wheat harvesting tools such as harvesters, threshers, and winnowers. A serious assessment was conducted using a method of simultaneous viewing and evaluation.

More than twenty kinds of tools that were simple to manufacture, light and flexible to use, easy to operate; generally able to obtain and solve raw materials locally; and generally improved work efficiency by ten to twenty times compared with manual labor, were decided to be widely promoted throughout the province. For example, the manually pushed and hand-cranked harvesters created by the Yanshi County Iron and Wood Industry Production Cooperative, and the manually pushed harvester created by Jia Mulin in Changge County, were made of wood except for the front serrated scissors and linkage shafts. This kind of farm tool could be made by only two or three workers, and one person could harvest 30 to 40 mu of wheat a day, improving harvesting efficiency by more than ten times compared to manual harvesting. The man-powered and animal-powered harvester created by workers at the Boai County Central Repair Factory required much less pulling force than past horse-drawn harvesters. One animal could pull it to harvest 40 to 50 mu of wheat a day, and if pushed by a person, it could harvest 30 mu a day. In terms of threshing and winnowing tools, the automatic winnower manufactured by the state-owned May 1st Farm only required one person to pour grain into the winnower and move the upper wind bucket to automatically fan the air, and it could winnow 20,000 to 30,000 jin of grain a day. In addition, among the tools displayed at the conference, some were appropriately improved old-style harvesting tools based on the original. For example, the three-bladed sickle modified by ironworkers in Luyi County, with three sickle heads installed on one wooden handle for alternating use, could reduce sharpening time, and it was estimated that it could improve work efficiency by 20%. The wheel-type double-bladed wheat shovel created by the Yexian County Handicraft Cooperative could shovel two rows of wheat at a time, and with the same labor intensity, it could improve efficiency by one time compared to the past use of a single-bladed shovel.

In view of this year's urgent tasks and the fact that many new-style tools had not yet been tested in actual production, the conference requested that all localities pay attention to the original old-style farm tools, and it should be affirmed that these old-style farm tools were still the main force in this year's wheat harvest and summer planting. Leaders at all levels should both promote the communist style of daring to think and dare to do, fully utilize the wisdom of the masses, actively create and promote various new wheat harvesting tools to improve labor efficiency, and lay the foundation for the widespread promotion of new wheat harvesting tools next year, and should also pay great attention to the addition and repair of old-style farm tools such as sickles and shovels. Neglecting any aspect is wrong.

In order to ensure the completion of this task, the conference determined that it was necessary to closely combine it with the ongoing extensive debate on preparations for wheat harvesting and summer planting in various localities, and take the mobilization of the masses to create, reform, and promote new summer harvesting and summer planting tools as one of the main contents, in order to liberate the masses' thinking, make everyone think of ideas, everyone offer suggestions, and launch a mass movement to rush to produce and promote low-cost, high-efficiency, and easy-to-manufacture harvesting, sowing, threshing, and transportation tools.

Thresher:

Created by Li Qingshan, a member of the Communist Youth League of the Xinguang Cooperative in Yangzhai Township, Changge County, Henan. Using the principle of a cotton gin, two rollers rotate to squeeze and crush the wheat ears, removing the wheat grains. The upper wooden roller is nine feet long and six inches in diameter. The machine bed is nine feet long and wide, and a hand-cranked wheel is used to drive it from the side (the belt on the wheel drives the wooden roller to rotate). It can thresh wheat from seventy mu of land every day.

### 赶制新农具　缩短麦收时间  河南决定突击制造农具一千七百万件

　　赶制新农具　缩短麦收时间
    河南决定突击制造农具一千七百万件
    本报讯　河南省在5月10日至12日召开了麦收夏种农具制造会议。会议要求各地迅速组织一切可能动员的技术力量，苦干十五昼夜，赶制各种新式的收割和脱粒等麦收农具七百二十万件，轻便运输工具一千万辆，并充分发挥原有旧式农具的潜力，以提高劳动效率，缩短麦收夏种时间，保证麦收夏种任务的胜利完成。
    会议集中了各地创造的麦收新工具的图纸和模型，展出了收割、脱粒、扬场等各种新式麦收工具三十多种，运用一边参观、一边评比的方法，进行了认真地鉴定。
    对于二十多种制作简单，使用轻巧灵便，易于操作；在原材料方面一般能就地取材，就地解决；工效一般都较用人工提高十倍到二十倍以上的工具，便决定普遍在全省推广。例如偃师县铁木业生产社创制的人推、手摇收割机和长葛县贾木林创制的手推收割机，除了前面锯齿形剪刀和联动轴外，都是木制的。这种农具一部只用两、三个工就能制成，一人操作一天能割麦三十亩到四十亩，比人力收割效率提高了十几倍。博爱县中心修配厂工人创造的人、畜力两用收割机，拉力比过去的马拉收割机轻得多，一头牲口牵引一天能割麦四十至五十亩，如用人推一天也能收三十亩。在脱粒扬场工具方面，国营五一农场制造的自动风车，只要一个人向风车里倒粮食，打动上面的风斗，自动扇风，一天能扬粮食二万至三万斤。此外，在会议上展出的工具中，有一些是在原有基础上进行适当改良的旧式收割工具。例如鹿邑县铁业工人改制的三头镰，在一根木柄上安着三个镰头，轮番使用，可以减少磨镰时间，估计可以提高工效20％。叶县手工业社创造的轮式双头收麦铲，一次可铲麦两垅，同样的劳动强度，能比过去使用单头铲，提高效率一倍。
    会议鉴于今年任务紧迫，不少新式工具还未经过实际生产的考验，因此，要求各地对原有的旧式农具加以重视，应当肯定这些旧式农具还是今年麦收夏种中的主力。各级领导既要发扬敢想、敢干的共产主义的风格，充分发挥群众智慧，积极创造和推广各种麦收新工具，提高劳动效率，并为明年普遍推广麦收新工具打下基础，也要十分注意镰刀、铲子等旧式农具的添置和修配。忽视任何一方面都是错误的。
    为了保证这一任务的完成，会议确定要密切结合各地目前正在广泛开展的关于麦收夏种的准备工作的大辩论，把发动群众创制、改制与推广夏收夏种新工具当作其中的一项主要内容，以解放群众思想，人人想办法，个个献计策，展开一个赶制和推广成本低、效率高、制作简便的收割、播种、脱粒、运输工具的群众性运动。
