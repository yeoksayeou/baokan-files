    Mother-and-Child Bicycle
    The Qingdao Bicycle Factory recently successfully trial-produced a mother-and-child bicycle and the "51" model Dawn bicycle.

    This mother-and-child bicycle is suitable for working women in cities to carry their children to and from work. Its shape is designed with reference to three-wheeled motorcycles. The body is shorter than ordinary bicycles, and it rides smoothly and lightly. Children can sit or lie down in the sidecar, which is comfortable and safe. This bicycle can also have the sidecar removed, becoming a lightweight and beautiful women's bicycle. The sidecar can also be used separately to push children.

    母婴车
    青岛自行车厂最近试制母婴车和“51”型曙光自行车成功。
    这种母婴车，适合城市劳动妇女上下班携带小孩乘骑。它的外形参照三轮摩托车设计，车身较一般自行车矮，行驶平稳轻便，小孩在挂斗内可坐可卧，既舒适又安全。这种车还可以把挂斗卸下，成为轻便美观的女自行车，挂斗也可以单独推小孩使用。
