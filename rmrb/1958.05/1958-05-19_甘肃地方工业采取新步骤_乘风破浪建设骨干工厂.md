Gansu Local Industry Takes New Steps
Bravely Advances to Build Backbone Factories

(Our dispatch from Lanzhou, 18th) Over 3,500 small factories and mines in counties, townships, and communes across Gansu Province have commenced production this year, a tenfold increase compared to the existing factories and mines. To summarize the experiences of the first stage of developing local industry and to arrange the next steps, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee convened a provincial local industry conference from the 6th to the 13th. The conference called for further strengthening of leadership, simultaneously focusing on new factories, old factories, and handicrafts, vigorously developing backbone industries with local heavy industry as the main content, and bravely advancing to push the construction of local industry to a new high tide.

The conference held that the reason so many factories and mines could be established in the past three months was mainly because Party committees at all levels in the province implemented the correct line of "the whole Party taking action, the secretary taking command, actively relying on the masses, and the whole people running industry on a large scale." Most factories and mines have implemented the principle of "running enterprises diligently and thriftily," not building new houses, not requiring many equipment, and management personnel are both factory directors, accountants, and workers. These new factories and mines, scattered in the countryside, are small in scale but play a significant role. For example, the newly built agricultural tool factories in the Tianshui area have produced more than 98,000 various vehicles and more than 180,000 various agricultural tools in a short period, powerfully promoting the great leap forward in agricultural production.

The conference held that it was right to build small factories and mines first. However, these small factories and mines cannot solve the current urgent need for large quantities of fertilizer, fuel, and agricultural machinery in the countryside, and it is impossible to catch up with and exceed the agricultural output value with local industrial output value in a few years relying on these small factories and mines. Therefore, according to the principle of combining large, medium, and small, while continuing to develop small factories and mines run by counties, townships, and communes, attention should also be paid to building backbone industries run by counties and above. After laying out the conditions and carefully calculating, the conference decided to build 236 new backbone factories and mines across the province this year, with 182 to be put into production by the end of the year. All 113 small blast furnaces newly built in the province this year can produce iron before the end of October, and 56,000 tons of pig iron can be produced this year. After all nine fertilizer plants built in Lanzhou, Tianshui, Yumen, and other places are put into production, they can produce more than 440,000 tons of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer annually, and the average cultivated land in the province can be fertilized with fourteen catties per mu. Seven medium and small-sized oil refineries built using coal, oil shale, and small oil fields can produce 146,000 tons of crude oil annually. Other items such as irrigation and drainage machinery, mountain tractors, machine tools, and ball bearings for making vehicles can also be self-sufficient after the backbone factories are put into production.

In order to guarantee the supply of equipment for the new factories and mines to be built in the future, the conference decided to organize the machine repair workshops of large industries, the internship workshops of industrial schools, and the original iron factories and repair shops to establish five collaborative manufacturing groups for coal-to-oil equipment, nitrogen fertilizer equipment, iron and steel smelting equipment, machine tools, and other complete sets of small heavy industrial equipment. The conference held that Party committees at all levels need to strengthen their leadership over local industry. Each county party committee and prefectural party committee must designate a secretary to be responsible for leading industry. The provincial party committee will also organize three industrial inspection teams to conduct inspections in various places in the coming days.

### 甘肃地方工业采取新步骤  乘风破浪建设骨干工厂

　　甘肃地方工业采取新步骤
　　乘风破浪建设骨干工厂
    本报兰州18日电　今年甘肃省各县、乡、社已经有三千五百多个小型厂矿投入生产，比原有厂矿多十倍。为了总结第一个阶段办地方工业的经验和安排下一步工作，中共省委从6日至13日召开了全省地方工业会议。会议要求进一步加强领导，把新厂老厂和手工业同时抓起来，大力发展以地方重工业为主要内容的骨干工业，乘风破浪，把地方工业建设推向新的高潮。
    会议认为，过去三个月所以能够办这么多厂矿，主要是由于全省各级党委贯彻了“全党动手，书记挂帅，积极依靠群众，全民大办工业”的正确路线。大多数厂矿都贯彻执行了“勤俭办企业”的方针，不盖新房屋，不要许多设备，管理人员是厂长、会计，又是工人。这些分散在农村的新厂矿，规模虽小，作用却很大。如天水专区新建的农具厂，短期内已经生产了各种车辆九万八千多辆，各种农具十八万多件，有力地推动农业生产的大跃进。
    会议认为，先办小厂矿是对的。但是这些小厂矿还不能解决当前农村迫切需要的大量化肥、燃料、农业机械等问题，而且依靠这些小厂矿不可能在几年内使地方工业产值赶上并超过农业产值。因此，根据大中小相结合的原则，在继续发展县乡社办的小型厂矿的同时，还要注意建设县以上办的骨干工业。会议经过摆条件、算细账，决定今年全省新建二百三十六个骨干厂矿，到年底将有一百八十二个投入生产。今年全省新建的一百一十三座小高炉，在10月底以前可以全部出铁，今年就可以生产生铁五万六千吨。在兰州、天水、玉门等地建设的九个化肥厂全部投入生产后，可以年产氮肥、磷肥四十四万多吨，全省现有耕地平均每亩可施化肥十四斤。利用煤、油页岩和小油田建设的七座中、小型炼油厂，每年能够生产原油十四万六千吨。他如排灌机械、山地拖拉机、机床和制车子用的滚珠轴承，骨干工厂投入生产以后，也可以自给。
    为了保证供应今后新建厂矿的设备，会议决定把大工业的机修车间、工业学校实习工场和原有的铁工厂、修配厂组织起来，成立煤炼油设备、氮肥设备、炼铁炼钢设备、机床等五个协作制造小组，制造成套小型重工业设备。会议认为，各级党委需要加强对地方工业的领导。各县委、地委都要指定一个书记负责领导工业。日内省委还将组织三个工业检查团到各地进行检查。
