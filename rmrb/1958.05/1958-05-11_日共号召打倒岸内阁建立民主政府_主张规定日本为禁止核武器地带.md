Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 10th: The Japanese Communist Party published a statement in the "Akahata" newspaper on May 2nd, elaborating on the JCP's policies regarding peace and complete independence, democracy, people's livelihood, economy, and culture. It also called on the Japanese people to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, which serves the US imperialists and Japanese monopoly capitalist groups, and to establish a democratic government.

    The statement advocates designating Japan as a nuclear-weapon-free zone, opposing the United States bringing nuclear weapons into Japan and arming the Japanese Self-Defense Forces with nuclear weapons, opposing the establishment of missile bases and atomic and hydrogen bomb bases in Japan, and opposing US planes and warships carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs flying in Japanese airspace and sailing in Japanese waters. The statement demands the removal of all US military bases and the withdrawal of US troops, the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan, and the abolition of the US-Japan "Security Treaty," "Administrative Agreement," and US-Japan "Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement."

    Regarding international peace, the statement demands that the United States and Britain follow the example of the Soviet Union, immediately and unconditionally halt nuclear tests, and conclude an international agreement unconditionally prohibiting the manufacture, stockpiling, and use of nuclear weapons. The statement also calls for the establishment of an Asian collective security system and the convening of a summit conference.

    The statement also demands the immediate conclusion of a Japan-Soviet peace treaty, the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, the promotion of peaceful reunification of Korea and Vietnam, the restoration of the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, and the abolition of the treaty between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    To realize democracy in Japan, the statement opposes revising the constitution, demands the full implementation of the clauses in the constitution that renounce war and guarantee the basic human rights and democratic rights of the people, and demands the abolition of reactionary laws that violate democratic rights, such as the anti-strike law and public security ordinances. The statement also opposes promoting "Tokko" politics—the wartime "Special Higher Police" fascist rule—which tramples on human rights, suppresses strikes, and conducts espionage activities.

    The statement firmly opposes the reactionary education policy consistently pursued by the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet, opposes the "performance rating" system aimed at controlling teachers and staff, and demands the implementation of a democratic education system.

    The statement also calls for stabilizing and improving the people's livelihood.
