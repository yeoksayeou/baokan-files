The anti-war novel "The Case of Sergeant Grischa," published in 1927, brought him international renown. The novel, through its depiction of the brutal suppression of Russian prisoners of war, exposed the atrocities of imperialism and Prussian military bureaucracy. Novels concerning the imperialist war published in 1931, 1935 and 1937 were famous in domestic and foreign literary circles. From 1933 to 1948, he lived abroad.

His early works, such as the 1928 poetry collection "Glow," the 1934 novel "Rivers Flow to the Sea," the 1936 poetry collection "Night Bridge," and the 1937 "Song of the Siren," had surrealist elements. Later, due to his long travels in Africa, the United States, and especially India, and contact with the lives of the working class and the people of various colonial countries, he changed his social and aesthetic views. He published political articles criticizing colonial oppression, actively participated in the struggle to defend peace, and published the realistic poem "Peace." At the Warsaw Peace Congress in 1950, he was elected Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council. He visited the Soviet Union in 1952 and objectively introduced the life of the Soviet people in many articles, which were fiercely attacked by bourgeois critics.
