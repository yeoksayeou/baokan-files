	Natural Gas: Is a hydrocarbon gas. Before humans evolved, large quantities of animals and plants in nature were buried underground, and after a long period of physical and chemical changes, they were formed. In places where this gas is gathered, as long as a well is drilled, the gas will naturally gush out, hence the name natural gas. It has many uses, and can be used to manufacture synthetic gasoline, carbon black, fertilizers and various chemical products, and it is the cheapest and most convenient industrial and civilian fuel.
	Permian Period: It has been about two billion years since the formation of the Earth. During this long geological age, many changes have taken place on the surface of the Earth. For the convenience of research, geologists have, based on many years of practice, studied the characteristics of minerals, fossils, and rocks in various strata, and divided the time of surface sedimentary strata into: Archean, Proterozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic. Each era is divided into several periods. The Permian Period is the last period in the Paleozoic Era. During the Permian Period, the entire Sichuan Province of China was a sea, depositing very thick strata and burying a large number of marine animals and plants, which are important raw materials for the generation of oil and natural gas. Now, in the Longchang gas field, a well has been drilled through the Permian strata, and there is a large amount of natural gas, indicating that the Permian strata are a promising target for finding natural gas and oil.
	Triassic Period: Is the earliest period of the Mesozoic Era. After the Permian Period, because the strata first named as Triassic strata can be clearly divided into three parts, this period was named the Triassic Period. During the Triassic Period, Sichuan was still a sea, continuing to deposit very thick strata and burying a large amount of organic matter. Now, the natural gas in Sichuan is mainly produced from this stratum, and a large amount of crude oil has been discovered in structures such as Huangguashan, which is also a target for finding oil.

    天然气及其它
    天然气：是一种炭氢化合物的气体。它在人类未演化成以前，自然界的动物和植物大量地被埋藏在地下，经过长时期的物理、化学变化之后而成。在聚集有这种气体的地方，只要打下一口井去，这种气体就会自然地喷出来，故名为天然气。它的用途很多，可以制造合成汽油、炭黑、肥料以及各种化工产品，并且是最便宜最方便的工业和民用燃料。
    二叠纪：从地球形成到现在，大约有二十亿年了。在这漫长的地质年代里，地球的表面发生了许多的变化。地质学家为了研究方便起见，根据许多年的实践，研究了各种地层中的矿物、古生物及岩石的特点，把地球表面沉积地层的时间，划分为：太古代，元古代，古生代，中生代和新生代。每个代又划分若干纪。二叠纪是古生代中最后的一个纪。我国四川省在二叠纪时期，全部是大海，沉积了很厚的地层，埋藏了大量的海生动物和植物，是生成石油和天然气的重要原料。现在在隆昌气田上，有一口井已钻穿了二叠纪地层，有大量天然气，说明了二叠纪地层是寻找天然气和石油很有希望的对象。
    三叠纪：是中生代最早的一个纪，在二叠纪时期之后，因为最早命名为三叠纪地层的地层可明显的分为三个部分，故将这个时期命名为三叠纪。四川在三叠纪时期仍是大海，继续沉积了很厚的地层和埋藏了大量的有机物质。现在四川的天然气，主要是从这个地层中生产出来的，并且在黄瓜山等构造上发现了大量的原油，也是寻找石油的对象。
