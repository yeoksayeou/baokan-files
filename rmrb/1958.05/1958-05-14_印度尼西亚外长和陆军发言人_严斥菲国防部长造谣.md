Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 13th: Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio issued a statement on the 12th refuting the lies recently spread by Philippine Defense Minister Vargas. Vargas had falsely claimed on the 10th that Soviet technicians were assisting the Indonesian armed forces in suppressing rebels.

Subandrio stated that he did not know whether Vargas' statement meant that he could not abandon aid to Indonesian rebels, or whether he was seeking an excuse to provide such aid.

Indonesian Army Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Piangadi also issued a statement on the 12th, condemning Vargas for acting as a mouthpiece for Indonesian rebels, and inviting Vargas to come to Indonesia to see for himself. He said that Vargas would then discover that his attacks were completely unfounded.

The Jakarta newspaper "Independent" pointed out on the 13th that the facts prove that the Philippines is implicated in the Indonesian problem. The newspaper questioned: Why does the Philippines remain silent about Americans and Chiang Kai-shek elements flying planes for the rebels? Why are the rebels able to freely enter and leave the Philippines? Why are Philippine airports readily available for use by Indonesian rebels?

"East Star Daily" said that some reckless leaders in the Philippines are clearly carrying out the military adventures launched by the US State Department and the Pentagon to show their loyalty to the United States. Vargas's remarks show this tendency. If necessary, these reckless leaders would be willing to implement Dulles' strategy of "Asians fighting Asians."

### 印度尼西亚外长和陆军发言人  严斥菲国防部长造谣

　　印度尼西亚外长和陆军发言人
　　严斥菲国防部长造谣
    据新华社雅加达13日电　印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在12日发表声明，驳斥菲律宾国防部长瓦加斯最近散布的谎言。瓦加斯在10日曾经造谣说，苏联技术人员协助印度尼西亚武装部队镇压叛乱分子。
    苏班德里约表示，不知道瓦加斯发表这样的谈话的意思是表明他不能放弃对印度尼西亚叛乱分子的援助呢，还是在寻求提供这种援助的借口。
    印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪中校也在12日发表谈话，谴责瓦加斯充当印度尼西亚叛乱分子的喉舌，同时邀请瓦加斯到印度尼西亚来亲眼看看。他说，这样瓦加斯就会发现他的攻击是完全没有根据的。
    雅加达“独立报”在13日指出，事实证明菲律宾同印度尼西亚问题有牵连。这家报纸质问道：为什么菲律宾对美国人和蒋介石分子替叛军驾驶飞机这件事保持沉默？为什么叛乱分子能够自由出入菲律宾？为什么菲律宾的飞机场随时可供印度尼西亚叛乱分子使用？
    “东星报”说，菲律宾的一些胆大妄为的领导人显然正在进行美国国务院和五角大楼所发动的军事冒险，以表示他们对美国的忠诚。瓦加斯的言论显示了这种倾向。如果必要的话，这些胆大妄为的领袖们会愿意贯彻杜勒斯的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的战略。
