Economic Comparison between North and South Vietnam
    By Bùi Công Trừng, Director of the Office of Finance and Trade, Prime Minister's Office of Vietnam

Currently, North and South Vietnam are under two different systems. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam in the North is developing and transforming its economy in accordance with socialism. In contrast, the South is still under the rule of a feudal landlord and comprador bourgeoisie regime and is becoming a new type of colony directed by US imperialism.

In the three years since the restoration of peace, North Vietnam has completed land reform. Although some mistakes were made during the land reform, it was basically a success. It enabled the working peasants to receive 895,000 hectares of land, more than 100,000 head of cattle, and many houses. This means that the remnants of feudalism in the North have been eliminated forever, paving the way for agriculture to enter a new production relationship—a socialist production relationship. Peasants continue to organize and develop mutual aid teams and production cooperatives. By the end of 1957, the entire North Vietnam had 85,000 seasonal and year-round mutual aid teams (note) and 44 agricultural production cooperatives. Generally speaking, due to the land reform and the organization of peasants into mutual aid teams, agricultural production in the North has not only recovered to the pre-war level of 1939 but has also far exceeded it. In 1956, the rice production in the North reached 4,132,000 tons, and even the best pre-war harvest never exceeded 3,500,000 tons; the average yield per hectare reached 1,820 kilograms, while the best pre-war harvest was only 1,500 kilograms. In 1957, despite the drought, the rice harvest still reached 3,947,000 tons. In the past, North Vietnam could not produce enough rice for its own needs, but in recent years it has been able to export a considerable amount of rice. In 1957, 180,000 tons of rice and 40,000 tons of corn were exported. This is a clear sign of economic stability, which has laid the foundation for the development of the North's economy.

In contrast, in South Vietnam, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime, following US instructions, promulgated various decrees on so-called "land reform" to force peasants who had received public land from the revolutionary government during the war of resistance to pay rent to the Ngo Dinh Diem regime. During the war of resistance, the revolutionary government had temporarily given peasants land belonging to landlords who had fled to areas occupied by the French army, land belonging to Vietnamese traitors, and land belonging to French colonialists. Now, the Ngo Dinh Diem regime is also forcing peasants to pay rent to landlords or sign contracts to purchase the land. For the land that peasants had taken back from landlords during the revolutionary period and the war of resistance, they are now required to return it to the landlords. The essence of the Ngo Dinh Diem regime's "land reform" policy is mainly to restore the land ownership of the landlords. Even more blatant is that they are even forcing the payment of public land rent; even the French colonialists had not dared to do this before in South Vietnam and South Central Vietnam. The US-Ngo Dinh Diem policy in "land reform" is to first restore the land ownership of the landlord class, and second, to capitalize the landlord class when needed, in order to collude with it to oppose the people's revolutionary movement, especially the peasant revolutionary movement. Ngo Dinh Diem and his cronies are attempting to force peasants to sign contracts to purchase 700,000 hectares of land that actually already belongs to them. This is the reason why the struggle between Southern peasants and landlords is becoming increasingly acute. In some places, it has developed into armed conflict. It is also for this reason that much land in the South remains uncultivated.

Agricultural production has declined even further in recent years, mainly due to social factors. Before the war, in 1942, rice production in the South reached 3,719,000 tons. But in the three years since the restoration of peace, despite Ngo Dinh Diem's coercion and enticement of the people to reclaim wasteland, production was only 3,502,000 tons. Rice exports reached 1,672,000 tons in 1939; but in 1957, Ngo Dinh Diem, after his greatest efforts, only exported 188,000 tons, even during the wartime year of 1954, 176,000 tons were exported. This means that rice exports are only slightly more than one-ninth of what they were before the war. This is a major reason for the decline in purchasing power of Southern peasants. This year, coupled with a large crop failure, the purchasing power of peasants will further decline and will have a great impact on the South's politics and economy.

Regarding rubber production, it appears to have increased significantly on the surface: 51,000 tons were produced in 1953, 70,000 tons were produced in 1956, and even more was produced in 1957. However, on the contrary, the area under rubber cultivation has been decreasing year by year: it reached 100,500 hectares in 1953, but only 62,300 hectares in 1957. As everyone knows, nine-tenths of the rubber plantations belong to French capital. This method of increasingly extracting rubber sap while the area under rubber cultivation is decreasing is a blind extraction method that rapidly transfers capital back to France. This extraction method will cause great damage to the Southern economy.

Regarding industry in North Vietnam, despite the severe damage suffered during the war and when the other side withdrew its troops, it has basically recovered in the three years since the restoration of peace. Compared with 1939, coal production increased by 42%, tin increased by 18%, matches increased by 27%, paper increased by 43%, and electricity, as well as the production of cotton cloth, silk, and the mining of apatite, have all exceeded 1939 levels. Along with economic recovery, more than 50 new industrial enterprises have been established throughout the North. Compared with 1955, the industry producing means of production increased fourfold, and the industry producing consumer goods increased 24-fold in 1957. This is a very significant matter. Handicraft industry has also recovered rapidly. Handicraft producers have also organized 5,400 production cooperative groups with 48,000 people. The output value of these production cooperative groups in 1957 was 31 billion Vietnamese currency, accounting for 12% of the total output value of handicraft industry.

If we calculate the total output value of state-owned and private industry and handicraft industry, it already accounted for 33.3% of the total value of industrial and agricultural output in 1957. Compared with the total output value of industry and handicraft industry, the output value of state-owned industry already accounts for 24.6%. Overall, North Vietnam's industry has established a solid foundation for consolidating the independence of the national economy.

In contrast, in South Vietnam, foreign goods are flooding in, so not only has pre-war industry not recovered, but industry and handicraft industry are generally in a state of decline.

The Hiep Hoa sugar factory used to produce 10,000 tons of sugar annually, but now it has dropped to only 2,000 tons annually. The rice mills in Cholon and Binh Tay, which used to have their machines running non-stop before the war, are now in a state of not having enough rice to mill because rice exports are only one-ninth of what they used to be. Because tens of millions of meters of foreign cloth are still piled up in warehouses and cannot be sold, two-thirds of the textile factories in South Vietnam lack work, and three-quarters of the hand looms have had to stop operating. Before the war, there were 600 sugar workshops in the South, producing 40,000 tons of sugar, but now there are only 120 left, producing 11,000 tons, because more than 50,000 tons of American sugar are imported annually.

Although there are 2,135 small industrial factories of Southern capitalists, their capital is only 257 million South Vietnamese currency; if compared with the 663 enterprises of foreigners (most of which are French capital and overseas Chinese), they are only equal to one-thirtieth of these enterprises, and if compared by the number of machines, they are only equal to one-fifteenth and a half. This shows that the Southern economy, including banking and raw materials, is still in the hands of foreign capital.

Regarding commerce, in North Vietnam, it has been growing day by day during the three years of economic recovery. The total value of retail sales: 504 billion Vietnamese currency in 1955, increasing to 1,022.2 billion Vietnamese currency in 1957. If we include the fourth quarter of 1957, the retail sales of state-owned trade, cooperatives, and state capitalist nature have accounted for 51% of the total retail sales. Trade with socialist countries, with 1955 as 100, increased to 171% in 1956 and 141% in 1957. The volume of trade with capitalist countries has also increased rapidly: 21,740,000 rubles in 1955, 15,002,000 rubles in 1956, and 57,140,000 rubles in 1957.

In contrast, South Vietnam is in a situation of increasingly increasing trade deficits in foreign trade: 678,800,000 South Vietnamese currency in 1955; the trade deficit increased to 731,700,000 South Vietnamese currency in 1957. A Southern capitalist organization, the "South Vietnam General Confederation of Industry," also admitted: "Throughout the past year, the Southern industrial sector has been in an extremely pessimistic situation. Domestic products have been fiercely competed against by foreign goods and seem to have been eliminated from their own national market. The purchasing power of the people is decreasing day by day, and goods are becoming increasingly difficult to sell. Producers have reached the point of exhaustion…"

In the countryside, peasants are unable to concentrate on production due to the fierce struggle against the conspiracy of landlords and the Ngo Dinh Diem regime to seize land, coupled with a drought that receives no assistance, all of which have caused poor harvests. In the cities, 53% of workers are unemployed, handicraftsmen are going bankrupt, factories are closing down, and coupled with the increasing burden of paying taxes for Ngo Dinh Diem's war budget (in 1957, 40% of Ngo Dinh Diem's war budget relied on foreign aid, and the portion that the people were forced to pay by Ngo Dinh Diem has increased to 60%, while it was only 35% in 1955), this has reduced the purchasing power of people of all strata and made their lives difficult.

Goods are not selling well, and at the end of 1957 there were still 80,000 tons of unsold goods in the warehouses. Now, the unsold goods in the warehouses have increased even more. Therefore, it can be said that as the United States increasingly dumps unsold goods into the South, the purchasing power of the South Vietnamese people, especially the peasants, is decreasing day by day, and thus the Southern industrial capitalists, and later even the commercial capitalists, will be dragged onto the road to bankruptcy.

The "land reform" policy and the policy of militarizing South Vietnam, manipulated behind the scenes by the United States, are the far-reaching causes of the South's economic decline. The current US economic crisis situation and the poor harvest in the South, which further reduce the purchasing power of peasants, are some new factors that are causing the South's economy to move towards a more profound crisis.

The economy of North Vietnam has basically recovered and is moving forward on the road of development. In contrast, the economy of South Vietnam is in a difficult situation, increasingly tending towards depression, and this situation is becoming increasingly serious. Due to the fact that the two economies are based on two different systems, different results have been produced. The superiority of the socialist system in the North has been clearly demonstrated to us.

Here, we can use a passage from the "Bombay News" to summarize: "Ngo Dinh Diem is very dissatisfied with the fact that North Vietnam is steadily and rapidly advancing on the road of developing industry and agriculture... While at this time, in the South, guns and cannons are everywhere, and it is full of chaos and oppression... Ngo Dinh Diem completely violates the interests of the Southern people..." Let me add that Ngo Dinh Diem violated the interests of the Vietnamese people and violated the interests of his motherland.

(Note) In early 1958, there were already more than 100,000 seasonal and year-round mutual aid teams.

　　越南北方和南方的经济对比
    越南总理府财贸办公室主任　裴公?
    现在，越南北方和越南南方处在两个不同的制度下面。北方的越南民主共和国正在按照社会主义发展和改造经济。相反的，南方则还处在封建地主和买办资产阶级政权的统治之下，并且正在变成一个由美帝国主义指挥的新型殖民地。
    和平恢复三年来，越南北方已经完成了土地改革。虽然在土地改革中犯了一些错误，但基本上取得了胜利，它使劳动农民分得了八十九万五千公顷土地、十万多头耕牛和很多房屋。这就是说，在北方残存的封建残余已经永远地被消除了，而为农业准备跨入新的生产关系——社会主义生产关系开辟了道路。农民继续组织起来，发展变工组和生产合作社。到1957年底，整个越南北方已经有八万五千个季节性的和常年性的变工组（注）以及四十四个农业生产合作社。总的说来，由于进行了土地改革和组织农民成立变工组，北方的农业生产不但已经恢复了战前1939年的水平，而且还远远超过了这个水平。1956年，北方稻米的生产已经达到四百一十三万二千吨，战前任何一个丰年也从未超过三百五十万吨；每公顷平均产量已经达到一千八百二十公斤，战前的丰年也不过一千五百公斤。1957年，尽管遭受了旱灾，稻米的收成还是达到了三百九十四万七千吨。在过去北方生产的大米是不能自足的，而在最近几年已经能够输出数量相当大的一部分大米。1957年出口了十八万吨大米和四万吨玉米。这是经济稳定的一个很明显的标志，它为北方经济的发展打下了基础。
    相反的，在越南南方，吴庭艳政权遵照美国的指示，颁布了关于所谓“土地改革”的各项谕令，来逼迫在抗战时期从革命政权分得公田的农民向吴庭艳政权交纳地租。在抗战期间革命政府曾暂时交给农民耕种跑到法军占领区的地主的土地、越奸的土地和法国殖民者的土地，而现在吴庭艳政权也迫使农民向地主交地租，或者订立合同，出钱购买。对于那些农民在革命时期和抗战时期从地主手中收回的土地，现在要退还给地主。吴庭艳政权“土地改革”政策的实质，主要是恢复地主的土地所有权。更为露骨的是，他们竟迫使交纳公田地租；这种做法以前法国殖民者在越南南部和中部以南地区都未敢如此。美国—吴庭艳在“土地改革”中的政策，一是恢复地主阶级的土地所有权，二是在需要的时候把地主阶级资本主义化，以便于同它勾结来反对人民的革命运动、特别是农民的革命运动。吴庭艳及其狐群狗党，企图逼迫农民订立合同，购买七十万公顷以前实际上已经属于他们自己的土地。这是南方农民和地主之间斗争日益尖锐的原因。有的地方已经发展成为武装冲突。也正由于这个原因，而南方土地还抛荒很多。
    最近几年的农业生产更加衰退，主要是由于社会因素决定的。战前，1942年南方稻米的产量曾达到三百七十一万九千吨。但是在和平恢复三年来，尽管吴庭艳强迫和诱使人民开荒，而产量也只不过三百五十万二千吨。大米的出口，1939年达到一百六十七万二千吨；而在1957年，吴庭艳经过最大的努力，也只出口了十八万八千吨，在战时1954年还能出口十七万六千吨呢。这就是说，大米的出口只有战前的九分之一强。这是南方农民购买力降低的一个很大原因。今年，加上大歉收，农民的购买力还将要进一步下降，并且对南方政治和经济将有很大的影响。
    关于橡胶的生产，从外表上看来好像增加了很多：1953年生产了五万一千吨，1956年生产了七万吨，1957年生产的还多些。但是，相反的，橡胶的种植面积却在逐年减少：1953年达到十万零五千公顷，到1957年只有六万二千三百公顷了。大家知道，橡胶种植园有十分之九是属于法国资本的。这种越来越多地采取橡胶汁和橡胶面积日益减少的开采方法，是使资本迅速转回法国的盲目的开采方法。这种开采方法将使南方经济遭到很大的损害。
    关于越南北方的工业，尽管在战争时期和对方撤军时遭到了很严重的破坏，但和平恢复三年来已经基本上恢复了。与1939年比较，煤的生产增加了42％，锡增加了18％，火柴增加了27％，纸增加了43％，电力以及棉布、绸子的生产和磷灰石的开采也都超过了1939年。在经济恢复的同时，有五十多个新的工业企业已经在北方各地建立起来。1957年与1955年比较，生产生产资料的工业增长四倍，生产消费品的工业增长二十四倍，这是一件具有十分重大意义的事情。手工业也迅速地恢复了。手工业生产者也组织了拥有四万八千人的五千四百个生产合作组，这些生产合作组在1957年的产值为三百一十亿越币，占手工业总产值的12％。
    如果计算一下国营和私营工业和手工业的总产值，在1957年已经占到工农业总产值的33.3％。与工业和手工业总产值比较，国营工业的产值已经占24.6％。总的说来，北方工业已经为巩固国民经济的独立建立了稳固的基础。
    相反的，在越南南方，外国商品大量地涌入，所以不但战前的工业没有恢复起来，而且一般说来工业和手工业正处于衰退的趋势。
    协和制糖厂以前每年生产一万吨糖，而现在下降到每年仅生产两千吨了。堤岸、平西的各碾米厂，战前是机器不停地转动，现在因为大米的出口只等于以前的九分之一而陷于没有足够的大米来碾的状态。由于成千万公尺的外国布还堆满仓库卖不出去，越南南方有三分之二的纺织厂缺少工作，并且有四分之三的手工织布机不得不停工。战前南方有六百家制糖作坊，产糖四万吨，现在因为每年进口五万多吨美国糖而只剩了一百二十家，产糖一万一千吨。
    南方资本家的小型工业工厂虽然有二千一百三十五个，但资本只有二万五千七百万元南越币；如果同外侨的六百六十三个企业（大部分是法国资本的和华侨的）比较，只等于这些企业的三十分之一，要是以机器的数目来比，也只等于十五点五分之一。这一点说明了南方经济，包括银行和原料方面，还掌握在外侨资本的手中。
    关于商业，在越南北方，在经济恢复的三年中一天天地增长。商业零售总值：1955年是五千零四十亿越币，1957年增加到一万零二百二十亿越币。如果把1957年第四季度计算在内，则国营贸易、合作社和国家资本主义性质的零售额已占零售总额的51％。同社会主义国家的贸易，以1955年为一百，则1956年增加到171％，1957年为141％。和资本主义国家的贸易量也增加的很快：1955年为二千一百七十四万卢布，1956年为一千五百万零二千卢布，1957年为五千七百一十四万卢布。
    相反的，越南南方在对外贸易上正处在入超日益增加的情况下：1955年入超六十七万八千八百万元南越币；1957年入超增加到七十三万一千七百万元南越币。南方资本家的一个组织“越南南方工业总会”也承认：“在过去整个一年中，南方工业界处在令人极其悲观的境地，国内产品遭到了外国货的剧烈竞争，似乎是被从自己国家的市场上淘汰出去了。人民的购买力一天天地下降，货物滞销日甚一日。生产者已经走到竭蹶的地步……”。
    在农村里，农民由于正在进行反对地主和吴庭艳政权夺取田地阴谋的激烈斗争而不能安心生产，再加上旱灾而得不到任何的帮助，这些都造成了庄稼的歉收。在城市中，有53％的工人失了业，手工业者遭到破产，工厂倒闭，再加上还要愈来愈多地给吴庭艳的战争预算缴纳赋税，（1957年吴庭艳的战争预算，有40％依靠外援，人民被吴庭艳逼迫交纳的部分已增加到60％，1955年只有35％）这就使得各阶层人民的购买力降低，生活窘困。
    货物销售不畅，1957年底在各仓库中还有八万吨滞销货物，到现在，仓库中的滞销货物更加多了起来。因此可以说，在美国日益加多地把滞销货物倾泻到南方的情况下，南越人民、尤其是农民的购买力则日益下降，因而南方的工业资本家以及此后连商业资本家也将被拖上破产的道路。
    由美国在幕后操纵的“土地改革”政策和使南越军事化的政策，是南方经济衰退的深远的原因。目前美国的经济危机情况以及南方的歉年景象，使农民的购买力更加降低，这是一些使南方经济走向更加深刻的危机的新因素。
    越南北方的经济已经基本上恢复了，并且正在发展的道路上前进。相反的，越南南方的经济则处在困难的境地，日益趋向萧条，并且这种情况日益严重。由于两种经济是建立在两种不同的制度上，所以产生了不同的结果。北方社会主义制度的优越性，鲜明地给我们显示了出来。
    在这里，可以借用“孟买新闻”的一段话来概括地作一结论：“吴庭艳非常不满意于越南北方在发展工农业的道路上正在稳固地大踏步前进……而在这个时候，在南方则是枪炮遍地，到处充满着紊乱和压迫……吴庭艳完全违背了南方人民的利益……”。让我补充一句，吴庭艳违背了越南人民的利益，违背了他的祖国的利益。
    （注）1958年初，季节性和常年性的变工组已经有十万多个。
