Doing a Good Job in the Demobilization of Conscript Soldiers
Commentator of this Newspaper

　　The "Provisional Regulations on Handling the Demobilization of Conscript Soldiers" issued by the State Council, as reported today, is a major event concerning the implementation of the Military Service Law and should attract the attention of leaders at all levels and the broad masses of people. According to the decision of the State Council in November 1954, the first batch of conscript soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army were conscripted and supplemented on a trial basis in accordance with the principle of the conscription system, and they are now being demobilized and returning to their hometowns one after another. In the future, a batch of conscript soldiers will be demobilized every year in accordance with the service period stipulated in the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China." Therefore, the demobilization of conscript soldiers must be properly handled.

　　Before enlisting in the army, conscript soldiers are generally outstanding members of our country's youth and are the backbone of the production front. During their active service, they have made great progress in all aspects through rigorous military training and political education in the army. Therefore, after their demobilization, like the demobilized soldiers of the past, they will be a reliable force in our country's socialist construction. At the same time, the demobilized conscript soldiers are generally incorporated into the first category of reserve service, and they are also a reserve force for our country's national defense. Doing a good job in the work after the demobilization of conscript soldiers and conscripting young people into the army are two inseparable and important aspects of our country's military service system. It is not only related to the smooth implementation of the conscription system, but also to the construction of national defense forces. This is an important political task, and Party committees and people's governments at all levels must pay full attention to this work.

　　Most of the conscript soldiers are conscripted from labor production posts, especially from agricultural production posts, and a small number are conscripted from work posts and schools. After their term of active service expires, they are still young and strong, and generally should return to their original production, work, or study posts. Therefore, the State Council stipulated in the "Provisional Regulations on Handling the Demobilization of Conscript Soldiers" that after the demobilization of conscript soldiers, they "should be handled in accordance with the principle of coming from where they go back to." That is: those who were farmers living in rural areas or urban suburbs when they enlisted should return to the villages and cooperatives where they originally lived to participate in agricultural production after demobilization; those who were formal staff or workers of state organs, people's organizations, enterprises, institutions, etc., when they enlisted should be arranged to work in their original units within two months if they request to work after demobilization; those who were students studying in schools when they enlisted should be allowed to resume their studies in their original schools if they request to continue their studies after demobilization and meet the study conditions themselves. This handling principle is correct. It is not only conducive to the needs of our country's current construction cause, but also in line with the wishes of the majority of conscript soldiers.

　　What needs to be especially pointed out here is the issue of conscript soldiers returning to rural areas to participate in agricultural production. In accordance with the requirements of Article 37 of the National Agricultural Development Program, demobilized conscript soldiers should become an active force in developing agricultural production. All demobilized soldiers must understand this and firmly establish the concept of loving agricultural labor. Socialist industry is the leading force in our country's national economy, and prioritizing the development of heavy industry is our country's firm and unwavering policy for building socialism. However, the development of industry must have the close cooperation of agriculture, and agriculture must supply sufficient grain and raw materials to meet the needs of industrial development. In these senses, there is no industry without agriculture, and without the corresponding development of agriculture, industry cannot have independent and strong development. Therefore, the Party Central Committee proposed the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture on the basis of developing heavy industry. It is necessary to vigorously develop agriculture while developing industry. Therefore, our goal is to build our country into a socialist power with both modern industry and modern agriculture. Currently, our country is carrying out a construction upsurge and a great leap forward in production. The broad masses of people in urban and rural areas are exerting revolutionary vigor on various production fronts, working day and night selflessly. Hundreds of millions of farmers in rural areas are marching towards agricultural production every day, and millions of workers and staff in factories, mines, and enterprises in cities are also continuously breaking production plan targets. Conscript soldiers from rural areas should immediately plunge into the upsurge of agricultural production after demobilization, and work hard and diligently with the people of the whole country to contribute all their strength to the development of agricultural production and the complete realization of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program. All ideas that belittle agricultural production, believe that engaging in agricultural production has no future, or are unwilling to return to rural areas to settle down are wrong and should be changed. As for the conscript soldiers who are no longer accustomed to their original life after being demobilized because they have become accustomed to the collective life of the army during their active service, and encounter some specific difficulties in arranging their own production, study, and life, this is inevitable and can be overcome. Local governments and cooperatives will also try their best to help everyone solve these difficulties; however, demobilized conscript soldiers cannot rely on the government and cooperatives because of this, and expect the government and cooperatives to solve everything. They should carry forward the fine tradition of hard work of the People's Army, overcome all difficulties with the spirit of diligence, bravery, and thrift, and become a model of diligence and thrift in the local area. Demobilized conscript soldiers should also actively participate in local militia organizations, protect production and construction, and resolutely fight against all bad people who undermine production.

　　Of course, after the demobilized conscript soldiers return to rural areas and cities, the local Party and government leading organs should give sufficient care and appropriate arrangements for their production and life, and supervise the subordinate civil affairs departments and conscription departments to conscientiously and responsibly do the relevant specific work. A part of the demobilized conscript soldiers are technical soldiers. For this group of personnel, labor departments at all levels should earnestly give priority to employment based on the local employment situation; those who cannot be arranged for employment temporarily should participate in agricultural production or other labor production, and then give priority to hiring them when technical personnel are needed in the future. Among the demobilized conscript soldiers, there are also a small number of people who did not have a fixed occupation before enlisting or whose original occupation is no longer suitable for national needs and cannot engage in their original occupation. The production or work of this group of people after demobilization should also be resolved in accordance with the principle of overall planning and appropriate arrangements. For the very few demobilized conscript soldiers who suffer from serious chronic diseases during their active service, the interim regulations stipulate appropriate solutions to the problems of disease treatment after demobilization in a responsible spirit.

　　Every year when handling the demobilization of conscript soldiers, all units should earnestly do a good job in political and ideological education for them before they leave the team in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations on Handling the Demobilization of Conscript Soldiers" issued by the State Council, and require them to continue to maintain the glorious tradition of the People's Army after demobilization, love labor, abide by government laws and regulations, unite with township and cooperative cadres, connect with the masses of the people, and strive to be a model demobilized soldier. People's governments at all levels should express a warm welcome to the demobilized conscript soldiers when they arrive at the local area. Because they have been away from production and work for a long time, the responsible comrades of counties and cities should introduce them to the local production, work, and other relevant aspects, and encourage them to work hard to participate in production and study. After the demobilized conscript soldiers returning to the countryside arrive home, grassroots organizations such as township people's committees and agricultural cooperatives should quickly make arrangements for them in production, help them become familiar with the situation of agricultural production, learn production technology, and try their best to provide them with convenience in engaging in agricultural production. Most of the conscript soldiers demobilized this year have returned to their hometowns. Civil affairs departments and conscription departments at all levels should conduct an inspection of the demobilization work of conscript soldiers in their respective regions in combination with the current central work, discover problems and solve them in a timely manner. And strengthen their political and ideological education, care about their progress, improve their political awareness, and enable them to play an active role in the overall socialist great leap forward.

　　做好义务兵的退伍工作
　　本报评论员
    今天报道的国务院关于处理义务兵退伍的暂行规定，是有关贯彻执行兵役法的一件大事，应该引起各级领导和广大人民的注意。根据1954年11月国务院的决定，按照义务兵役制的原则试行征集补充中国人民解放军的第一批义务兵，现在已经陆续退伍还乡。今后每年都将有一批义务兵按照中华人民共和国兵役法中服役期限的规定退伍。因此，对于义务兵的退伍工作必须妥善地加以处理。
    义务兵在入伍以前，一般都是我国青年中的优秀分子，是生产战线上的骨干。他们在服现役期间，经过部队严格的军事训练和政治教育，在各方面都有很大进步。因此，他们退伍以后，同过去的复员军人一样，将是我国社会主义建设中的依靠力量。同时，退伍的义务兵一般的又都编入了第一类预备役，他们又是我国国防上的后备力量。做好义务兵退伍以后的各项工作和征集青年入伍，是我国兵役制度不可分割的两个重要方面。它不仅关系着义务兵役制的顺利推行，而且也关系着国防力量的建设，这是一项重要的政治任务，各级党委和人民政府必须充分重视这项工作。
    义务兵大部分是从劳动生产岗位特别是从农业生产岗位上应征入伍的，一小部分是从工作岗位上和学校中应征入伍的。在他们服现役期满以后，都还是年富力壮的青年，一般的仍应回到原来的生产、工作或者学习岗位上去。因此，国务院在关于处理义务兵退伍的暂行规定中确定：义务兵退伍后，“应本着从那里来回到那里去的原则进行处理。”这就是：入伍时，原是家居农村或者城市郊区的农民，退伍后都应当回到原居住地的乡、社参加农业生产；入伍时原是国家机关、人民团体、企业、事业等单位的正式职员或者工人，退伍后要求工作的，原单位应在两个月内安排他们的工作，入伍时原是在学校学习的学生，退伍后要求继续学习而本人又符合学习条件的，原学校应当准予复学。这个处理原则是正确的，它既有利于我国当前建设事业的需要，又符合广大义务兵的愿望。
    这里需要特别提出的，义务兵退伍回到农村参加农业生产的问题，按照全国农业发展纲要第三十七条的要求，退伍的义务兵应该成为发展农业生产的积极力量。所有的退伍士兵都必须了解这一点，坚定地树立起热爱农业劳动的观念。社会主义工业是我国国民经济的领导力量，优先发展重工业是我国建设社会主义坚定不移的方针。但是工业的发展必须要有农业的密切配合，农业必须以足够的粮食和原料供应工业发展的需要。从这些意义上讲，没有农业便没有工业，农业得不到相应的发展，工业就不可能有单独强大的发展。因此，党中央提出了要在发展重工业的基础上实行工、农业同时并举的方针。要在发展工业的同时大力发展农业。因此，我们的目标是要把我国建设成为一个既有现代工业又有现代农业的社会主义强国。目前我国正在开展一个建设高潮和生产大跃进，广大的城乡人民正在各个生产战线上鼓足革命干劲，不分昼夜地、忘我地劳动着。农村中每天都有亿万的农民向农业生产进军，城市中千百万厂矿、企业的职工也在接连不断地突破生产计划指标。从农村来的义务兵退伍以后应当立即投入农业生产高潮里去，同全国人民一道艰苦奋斗，克勤克俭，为发展农业生产，为彻底实现全国农业发展纲要修正草案而贡献出自己的全部力量。一切轻视农业生产，认为从事农业生产没有前途或者不愿回到农村安家落户的思想是不对的，应当改变。至于义务兵因为在服现役期间过惯了部队的集体生活，退伍以后，对原来的生活已不习惯，在安排自己的生产、学习和生活当中，遇到一些具体困难，这是不可避免的，也是可以克服的。当地政府和合作社也会尽量帮助大家解决这些困难；不过退伍的义务兵不能因此依赖政府和合作社，事事要政府和合作社来解决，应当发扬人民军队艰苦奋斗的优良传统，用勤劳、勇敢和节俭的精神来克服一切困难，要成为当地勤俭节约的模范。退伍的义务兵还应当积极参加地方的民兵组织，保卫生产建设，与一切破坏生产的坏人进行坚决的斗争。
    当然，退伍的义务兵回到农村、城市以后，当地的党、政领导机关，应该对他们的生产和生活予以足够的关心和适当的安排，并督促所属民政部门和兵役部门认真负责地做好有关的具体工作。退伍义务兵有一部分技术兵，对于这一部分人员，各级劳动部门应当切实地根据当地用人情况予以优先就业；凡是暂时不能安排就业的，应当参加农业生产或者其他劳动生产，以后需用技术人员时再优先录用他们。退伍的义务兵当中还有少数人员在入伍前没有固定职业或者原来的职业已经不适合国家需要，而不能从事原来的职业。对于这一部分人员退伍以后的生产或者工作，也应当根据统筹兼顾适当安排的原则加以解决。对于极少数在服现役期间患有严重慢性病的退伍义务兵，退伍以后的疾病治疗等问题，在暂行规定中，都本着负责的精神规定了适当的解决办法。
    各部队每年在处理义务兵退伍的时候，应当切实按照国务院关于处理义务兵退伍的暂行规定，认真地对他们做好离队前的政治思想教育工作，要他们退伍以后继续保持人民军队的光荣传统，热爱劳动，遵守政府法令，团结乡、社干部，联系人民群众，为争取作一个模范的退伍军人而奋斗。各级人民政府在退伍义务兵到达地方的时候，应当向他们表示热烈的欢迎。因为他们离开生产、工作时间较长，县、市的负责同志应当向他们介绍当地生产、工作和其他有关方面的情况，鼓励他们努力参加生产和学习。回农村的退伍义务兵到家以后，各乡人民委员会和农业合作社等基层组织，应当很快地对他们做好生产上的安排，帮助他们熟悉农业生产情况，学习生产技术，尽量给他们从事农业生产上的便利。今年退伍的义务兵已经绝大部分回乡，各级民政部门和兵役部门，应当结合当前的中心工作对于所属地区处理义务兵的退伍工作进行一次检查，发现问题，及时解决。并且加强他们的政治思想教育，关心他们的进步，提高他们的政治觉悟，使他们在社会主义全面大跃进中发挥积极作用。
