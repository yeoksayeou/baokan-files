Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, 11th—Lebanon's northern city of Tripoli erupted again on the 10th with mass demonstrations against the government's reign of terror and protesting the assassination of Lebanon's renowned nationalist leader and publisher of "Al-Telegraph," Matni. The government dispatched large numbers of armed police, soldiers, gendarmes, and tanks for bloody suppression, resulting in bloody clashes. According to Damascus Radio's broadcast this morning, fourteen people died and one hundred and sixteen were injured in the clashes.

　　News from Lebanon indicates that on the 10th, in Zgharta, Akkar, and Hermel in northern Lebanon, clashes also occurred with security forces when the masses held demonstrations against terrorism and the government's pro-Western policies.

　　The Tripoli demonstration was held in response to the call by Lebanese opposition parties and nationalist leaders to hold a general strike to protest Matni's murder.

　　The demonstration began around 10 a.m., and more and more people joined later. The demonstrators shouted slogans against President Chamoun and Prime Minister Solh. The police attempted to disperse them with batons, and the army was also ordered to carry out armed suppression, which aroused public outrage. They fought back with stones, and angry crowds also set fire to a building of the United States Information Service. During the mass demonstration, the army and police even opened fire to massacre people, resulting in a large-scale bloody tragedy.

　　According to the Middle East News Agency, demonstrators in Zgharta occupied all police stations in the city and arrested nearly one hundred policemen, holding them as hostages.

　　The news agency also said that some army officers and many Beirut garrison troops refused to obey orders to open fire on the demonstrators yesterday.

　　It is said that Chamoun presided over a cabinet meeting that evening to discuss the turbulent situation. The cabinet decided to increase the city's garrison. Chamoun also hurriedly went to the U.S. Embassy to apologize.

　　Lebanese authorities arrested Habib Nahouli, the publisher of "Al Kifah," that evening because the newspaper published news of the government's alleged attempt to blow up the "Al Kifah" newspaper office.

    新华社大马士革11日电　黎巴嫩北部城市的黎波里10日再次爆发了群众示威，反对政府的恐怖统治和抗议黎巴嫩著名民族主义领袖、“电讯报”社长马特尼遭到暗杀。政府出动了大批武装警察、军队、宪兵和坦克进行血腥镇压，造成流血冲突。据大马士革电台今天早上广播，在冲突中有十四人死亡，一百一十六人受伤。
    来自黎巴嫩的消息表明，10日在扎加塔、奥卡尔和黎巴嫩北部的赫麦尔，当群众举行示威反对恐怖主义和政府的亲西方政策的时候，也同保安部队发生了冲突。
    的黎波里的示威是为了响应黎巴嫩反对党和民族主义领袖关于举行总罢工以抗议马特尼被害的号召而举行的。
    示威在上午十点左右开始，后来参加的人越来越多。示威群众高呼反对夏蒙总统和索勒哈总理的口号。警察用警棍企图驱散他们，陆军部队也奉命开来实行武装镇压，以致群情激昂，用石块进行反击，愤怒的群众并且放火烧毁了美国新闻处的一所建筑物。在群众示威时，军队和警察竟开枪屠杀，造成大规模流血惨案。
    据中东通讯社报道，扎加塔的示威者占领了市内的所有警察局，并且逮捕了将近一百个警察，把他们作为人质。
    这家通讯社还说，一些陆军军官和许多贝鲁特驻军昨天拒绝服从向示威者开火的命令。
    据说夏蒙在当天晚上主持了为了讨论动荡的局势而举行的内阁会议。内阁决定增派城市的驻军。夏蒙还慌忙前去美国大使馆赔礼道歉。
    黎巴嫩当局当天晚上逮捕了“斗争报”社长哈比卜·纳胡利，因为这家报纸刊载了所传政府企图炸毁“斗争报”报馆的消息。
