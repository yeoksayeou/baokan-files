    A Conspiracy to Defeat Clerical Dictatorship
    —The Election Struggle in Italy
    By Salci, Reporter for "Unità," Italy
    On May 25th and 26th, more than 32 million Italian voters will cast their ballots to elect a new Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The election slogan put forward by the Italian Communist Party is: "Strive for the progress of workers and democracy, oppose the clerical dictatorship and the threat of atomic war, do not vote for the Christian Democratic Party, and cast your vote for the Communist Party." This slogan is based on the historical situation of the past ten years. In these ten years, many changes have taken place in the Italian political situation.
    In 1947, the ruling Christian Democratic Party of Italy abandoned the policy of unity among all parties, which was the main foundation of the war of liberation, and excluded the Communist Party and the Socialist Party from the government. In 1948, the Christian Democratic Party used all legal and illegal means, even relying on open American intervention, to obtain an absolute majority in the parliament. Subsequently, the Christian Democratic Party, together with some other bourgeois political parties, such as the Liberal Party, the Republican Party, and the Social Democratic Party, launched a large-scale offensive against the people's parties and organizations. In a short period of time, a series of events endangering the interests of the Italian people occurred one after another: the Christian Democratic Party established a split trade union organization (which often cooperated with capitalists) to undermine the workers' movement under the unified leadership of the General Confederation of Labor; poor peasants demanding land and workers striking to oppose layoffs and demand higher wages were suppressed; there was an attempt to assassinate Comrade Togliatti; and Italy joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. However, the struggle waged by the people forced the Christian Democratic Party and its alliance to refrain from openly formulating laws prohibiting left-wing parties. And the conspiracy to assassinate Comrade Togliatti sparked a general strike throughout Italy, demonstrating the powerful strength of the working class.
    By 1952, the Christian Democratic Party realized that it had lost the support it had gained in 1948 when it obtained an absolute majority in parliament. In these five years, the economic policies implemented by the Christian Democratic Party government had made the vast majority of the people poorer than before, while the rich became richer and richer. Fearing defeat in the general election, the Christian Democratic Party then formulated a new election law: as long as a certain "group of parties" obtained more than 50% plus one vote of the total votes, it could obtain two-thirds of the seats in the parliament. Since the other political parties allied with the Christian Democratic Party were very weak, the Christian Democratic Party was able to rely on this method to once again obtain an absolute majority in parliament.
    The struggle caused by the new election law was the most intense and fierce struggle since the liberation of Italy. If the Christian Democratic Party had its way, even bourgeois democracy would be strangled, the suppression of the people would become endless, and a dangerous situation of national division would arise. In the election held on June 7, 1953, the Christian Democratic Party and its alliance failed. They did not win 50% of the total votes, let alone implement the "one more vote" necessary for the "fraud law" as it had long been called by the people (the new election law was later abolished, but people still call it the fraud law). The Christian Democratic Party found itself in a difficult situation.
    The frequently mentioned "June 7th" election defeated the attempt of the Christian Democratic Party to establish a new dictatorial regime, but it did not completely change the situation in Italy. The Christian Democratic Party, with the help of its small allied parties, still held power. But later the government alliance split, and the Christian Democratic Party had to expose its true colors (in the past, it had always called itself a "centrist party" that opposed both socialism and fascism). The new government led by Zoli obtained and accepted the support of the Fascist Party and the monarchists, and its policies could only turn to the extreme right.
    Now the Christian Democratic Party is again asking the Italian people for an absolute majority in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (the Senate election is scheduled to be held next year, but it has now been dissolved and held earlier. This means that if they win a solid majority, they do not have to worry about holding new elections in five years). In order to achieve this goal, they put forward a slogan: "We demand progress, but what we demand is progress without risk." This so-called "risk" refers to the opportunity for the Communist Party to win more votes and for the working class to win victory and for Italy to embark on a new path. In fact, it is difficult to find any signs of progress in the program published by the Christian Democratic Party on the eve of the general election. The Christian Democratic Party mainly relies on small and medium-sized farmers. Because of their religious beliefs, they are forced to vote for the Christian Democratic Party. However, the leadership of the Christian Democratic Party is in the hands of representatives of industrial capitalists and landlords, who never care about the interests of farmers.
    Therefore, it is found that the Christian Democratic Party's program contains many items that reflect the demands put forward by those capitalist associations, large enterprises, monopolists who control important sectors of the national economy, and big landlords, and rarely takes into account the demands of the masses. For example, capitalists demand that industrial enterprises partially or wholly controlled by the state should not be regarded as tools for competing with private enterprises, because such competition would reduce the profits of private enterprises. The answer to this demand is: they will not be regarded as such tools. Take the European Common Market issue as another example. The Christian Democratic Party's program says that Italy will benefit greatly from participating in this market. But making the weak Italian agriculture compete with the stronger agriculture of countries like West Germany and France means that a large number of poor and middle peasants will be forced to sell their land to the landlords, because only the landlords can provide the large amount of investment needed for this competition. It is foreseeable that two to three million farmers will be forced to sell their land in this way. Just looking at the fact that there are still about two million unemployed workers in Italy, and even more people (especially in the impoverished south) are underemployed, it is clear what this situation will mean for the Italian economy.
    The Christian Democratic Party's program has been enthusiastically welcomed by the Italian bourgeois press (90% of Italian newspapers are controlled by capitalists). This also shows the true content of this program. Of course, there are also individual people within the Christian Democratic Party who call themselves "leftists," but as long as they refuse to take any steps to promote the unity of the working people, their left-leaning tendency is actually very questionable. However, the church, which often interferes in political affairs, also wants to prevent all believers from voting for these people and instead vote for the most conservative representatives within the Christian Democratic Party. The church's interference on the eve of this election is even more serious than in the past. There is a decree in Italy that prohibits such interference by the church, but the government, which benefits from this interference, strives to avoid implementing the decree.
    In the last general election, the Communist Party won more than six million votes, and the Socialist Party won more than three million votes. Therefore, the votes obtained by the left-wing parties are almost equal to the votes obtained by the Christian Democratic Party. Although some leaders of the Socialist Party have adopted a wavering attitude towards the ruling party in recent years, further victories for the Communist Party and the Socialist Party will cause difficulties for the Christian Democratic Party. This is why all the ruling party's propaganda weapons, such as newspapers, advertisements, radio, television, movies, and the church, are concentrated on attacking the Communist Party. In fact, the Italian Communist Party demands a fundamental change in the situation mentioned above; demands that the Common Market not take effect in order to avoid harmful consequences; demands a resolute struggle against corruption and embezzlement and against the misappropriation of state funds for private purposes; demands that the clergy not interfere in politics so as to avoid conflicts between believers and non-believers, which are harmful to the church, the state, and the working people; the Italian Communist Party also demands a reduction in the power of monopoly capital, strives for effective social reforms, provides jobs for the unemployed, and improves the living conditions of those already employed. This is a program that is diametrically opposed to the Christian Democratic Party.
    In terms of foreign policy, the situation has also been very bad since Italy joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The Italian government has accepted the plan to establish missile bases on Italian territory and has consistently implemented the policy of saying "no" to every proposal put forward by the Soviet Union. It seems that the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party are convinced that peaceful coexistence is detrimental to their interests. The fact is also true: the tension of the international situation means the tension of the internal situation, and past experience has proved that the easing of international tensions deprives them of the basis for political discrimination against the people's parties. The Christian Democratic Party's policy is sometimes simply unbelievable. For example, when every country is arguing about the trade embargo against China, the Christian Democratic Party approves the Fascist Party's proposal to send an ambassador to Taiwan; when the Soviet Union stops all nuclear tests, they say this is "propaganda," a "worthless" gesture. When China withdrew its volunteers from Korea, they remained silent, and the radio and government newspapers did not publish the news. And they expressed great anger at the easing of international tensions after the Soviet Union launched its artificial satellite. The Soviet Union's launch of the artificial satellite had a great impact on public opinion because it showed that a shift had taken place in the international situation, and it also showed how wrong the Christian Democratic Party was to rely on the "position of strength" policy, because their position had certainly been weakened.
    The struggle against the atomic threat is one of the most important items in the Communist Party's election program. The Italian Communist Party's election program embodies the universal demands of the broad strata of the Italian people. This is why the ruling party, despite possessing powerful propaganda tools, is still afraid of the further growth of the Communist Party's strength. Recently, almost all sectors of workers in Italy have responded to the call of the trade unions and held large-scale strikes to fight for improved living conditions. At the same time, broad strata of the people are also disturbed by the military obligations undertaken by the government. Last year, some local elections were held immediately after the large-scale anti-communist movement caused by the Hungarian incident, and the results showed that the Communist Party still increased its votes in many places. This means that more and more people are realizing where the way out of the current situation lies.

    击败教权独裁统治的阴谋
    ——意大利的竞选斗争
    意大利“团结报”记者　萨尔奇
    5月25日、26日，三千二百多万意大利选民将投票选举新的众议院和参议院。意大利共产党所提出的大选口号是：“争取工人和民主的进展，反对教会独裁和原子战争威胁，不投天主教民主党的票，把你的票投给共产党。”这句口号是根据最近十年来的历史情况而提出来的。在这十年里，意大利政治情势发生了许多变化。
    1947年意大利的执政党天主教民主党抛弃了作为解放战争中的主要基础的各党派团结一致的政策，把共产党和社会党排挤出政府。1948年天主教民主党利用一切合法和不合法的手段，甚至依靠美国的公开干涉，在议会中获得了绝对多数。接着，天主教民主党就和某些其他资产阶级政党，例如自由党、共和党、社会民主党一起，对人民的政党和团体开始了大规模的进攻。在短短时间内接连地发生了一连串危害意大利人民利益的事情：天主教民主党成立了分裂的工会组织（这个组织经常和资本家合作的），借以破坏在总工会统一领导下的工人运动；要求土地的贫苦农民和为反对解雇、要求提高工资而罢工的工人受到了镇压；有人企图暗杀陶里亚蒂同志；意大利参加了北大西洋公约组织。但是，人民所进行的斗争迫使天主教民主党和它的联盟不敢公开制订禁止左翼党派的法律。而暗杀陶里亚蒂同志的阴谋在全意大利掀起了一个总罢工，显示了工人阶级的强大力量。
    到1952年，天主教民主党认识到它已经失去了1948年在议会获得绝对多数时所得到的支持。在这五年中，天主教民主党政府所执行的经济政策已经使广大阶层的人民比过去更加贫困，而富有的人却越来越富有。由于害怕在大选中受到挫败，当时天主教民主党制定了一项新的选举法：只要某个“政党集团”获得的选票比总额的50％多一票，它就能在议会中得到三分之二的席次。由于同天主教民主党结成联盟的其他政党十分弱小，天主教民主党就能够依靠这种办法再度在议会中得到绝对多数。
    新选举法所引起的斗争是意大利解放以来的最激烈、最厉害的斗争。如果天主教民主党如愿以偿，连资产阶级的民主也会遭到扼杀，对人民的镇压将会变得毫无止境，并且会出现一个危险的全国分裂的局面。1953年6月7日举行的选举中，天主教民主党和它的联盟失败了，它们并没有赢得选票总额的50％，更谈不上实施那早已被人民称为“欺骗法”所必须的“再加一票”（新选举法后来已被废除，但是人们至今仍把它叫做欺骗法）。天主教民主党发现它自己正处在一个困难的境地。
    人们经常提起的“6月7日”的选举，击败了天主教民主党建立新独裁政权的企图，但是并没有彻底改变意大利的形势。天主教民主党凭借它的小的联盟党派的帮助仍然掌握着政权。但是后来政府联盟分裂了，天主教民主党不得不暴露了它的真实的面貌（过去它一直自称是“中间派政党”，既反对社会主义也反对法西斯主义）。由佐利领导的新政府得到并接受了法西斯党和保皇党的支持，它的政策当然只能转向极右翼的方向。
    现在天主教民主党又向意大利人民要求众议院和参议院中的绝对多数（参议院的选举按规定明年举行，现在也被解散提前举行。这意味着如果他们赢得一个巩固的多数，他们就不必在五年中担心举行新的选举）。为了达到这个目的，它们提出了一个口号：“我们要求进步，但是我们所要求的是一个没有冒险的进步”。这所谓“冒险”就是指共产党获得更多的选票和工人阶级获得胜利使意大利有走上一条新的道路的机会。实际上，从天主教民主党在大选前夕发表的纲领中很难发现任何进步的迹象。天主教民主党的主要依靠是中小农民。由于宗教信仰的原故，他们被迫投天主教民主党的票。但是天主教民主党的领导掌握在工业资本家和地主的代表们的手里，他们是绝不关心农民的利益的。
    因此人们发现天主教民主党的纲领里，有许多项目反映了那些资本家协会、大企业、控制国民经济重要部门的垄断资本家和大地主们所提出的要求，而很少顾到群众的要求。例如，资本家要求：不应该把由国家部分或全部控制的工业企业当作是和私人企业进行竞争的工具，因为这种竞争会降低私人企业的利润。这个要求得到的回答是：它们不被当作这种工具。再以欧洲共同市场问题为例，天主教民主党的纲领说意大利参加这个市场将得到许多好处。但是使衰弱的意大利农业去和像西德、法国这些国家较强的农业竞争，意味着大批贫农和中农将被迫把他们的土地出卖给地主，因为只有地主们才能够提供这种竞争所需要的大量投资。可以预料，这样一来将会有二、三百万农民被迫出卖他们的土地。只要看一下目前意大利仍然有二百万左右失业工人，甚至有更多的人（特别是在穷困笼罩下的南方）处于半失业状况的事实，也就能够清楚地看出这种情况对意大利的经济将意味着什么。
    天主教民主党的纲领受到意大利资产阶级报刊狂热的欢迎（意大利报纸的90％是由资本家控制的）。这也说明了这个纲领的真实内容。当然，在天主教民主党内也有个别的、自称为“左派”的人，但是只要他们拒绝采取任何步骤来促进劳动人民的团结，他们这种左的倾向实际上也大成问题。然而经常干涉政治事务的教会，还要阻止所有教徒投这些人的票，而把票投给天主教民主党内那些最保守的代表。教会在这次选举前夕的这种干涉甚至比过去更为严重。意大利有一项法令禁止教会的这种干预，但是从这种干预中得到好处的政府竭力避免实行该项法令。
    共产党在上一次大选中曾获得了六百多万选票，社会党得到了三百多万选票。因此左翼政党所获得的选票几乎等于天主教民主党所得的选票。虽然最近几年来社会党某些领导成员对执政党采取了一种摇摆不定的态度，然而共产党以及社会党获得进一步的胜利将会对天主教民主党造成困难。这就是执政党的全部宣传武器例如报纸、广告、无线电、电视、电影和教会集中攻击共产党的原因。实际上，意大利共产党要求根本改变上面所谈到的那种形势；要求不让共同市场生效，以避免有害的后果；要求与贪污腐化进行坚决的斗争，反对为了私人的目的挪用国家的钱财；要求神职人员不要干涉政治，以免引起教徒和非教徒的冲突，这种冲突对教会、国家和劳动人民都是有害的；意大利共产党也要求减少垄断资本的权力，争取进行有效的社会改革，使失业的人得到工作并改善已经就业的人的生活条件。这是和天主教民主党针锋相对的一个纲领。
    在外交政策方面，自从意大利参加北大西洋公约组织之后，情况也很不妙。意大利政府已经接受在意大利领土上建立导弹基地的计划，并一贯地执行对苏联提出的每一个建议都说“不”的这种方针。看来天主教民主党的领导人深信和平共处是有害于他们的利益的。事实也是如此：国际局势的紧张意味着内部局势的紧张，过去的经验已经证明，国际紧张局势的缓和剥夺了他们对人民的政党实行政治歧视的基础。天主教民主党的这个政策有时简直令人难以置信，例如：当每一个国家都在争论以中国为对象的贸易禁运问题的时候，天主教民主党却赞成法西斯党的关于派一名大使去台湾的建议；当苏联停止一切核试验时，他们说这是“宣传”，是一个“毫无价值”的姿态。当中国从朝鲜撤退志愿军的时候他们保持沉默，电台和政府报纸都没有发表这项新闻。而他们对于苏联发射人造卫星之后的国际紧张局势的缓和却表示非常愤怒。苏联发射人造卫星在公众舆论中曾经造成了很大的影响，因为它显示出在国际形势中形势已发生了转变，也表明天主教民主党依赖于“实力地位”政策是多么错误，因为他们的地位已经肯定地削弱了。
    反对原子威胁的斗争是共产党竞选纲领中最重要的项目之一。意大利共产党的竞选纲领体现了意大利广泛阶层人民的普遍要求。这就是为什么执政党虽然掌握着有力的宣传工具，而仍然害怕共产党力量的进一步增长。近来几乎意大利所有各部门的工人都响应工会的号召，举行了争取改善生活条件的大罢工。同时广大阶层的人民也对政府所承担的军事义务感到不安。去年，紧接着由于匈牙利事件而引起的大规模的反共运动之后而举行的一些地方选举，结果表明在许多地方共产党仍然增加了选票。这意味着越来越多的人民正在认识到摆脱目前状况的出路在哪里。
