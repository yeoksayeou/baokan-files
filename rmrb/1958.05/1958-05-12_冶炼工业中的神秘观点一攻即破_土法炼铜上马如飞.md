Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, 11th – What path should be taken to develop local copper smelting industry? The National Local Copper Smelting Experience Exchange Conference and the Sichuan Provincial Copper Smelting Conference, recently held in Gao County, Sichuan Province, systematically summarized experience in this area.

　　These experiences mainly include: focusing on small scale, implementing simultaneous mining, prospecting, and production; making use of simple and crude conditions, using local materials, and prioritizing production-oriented construction; seeking out folk technical talents, strengthening cooperation between technicians and local experts, and utilizing various technical forces such as school teachers; arranging production scale and methods according to resources, power, transportation conditions, adapting to local conditions, and being economically rational; in terms of production methods, starting with indigenous methods and then transitioning to foreign methods, continuously carrying out technological innovation; mobilizing the masses to run factories, and relying on agricultural cooperatives to supply labor.

　　These experiences are summarized based on the situation of developing local copper smelting industry in Sichuan Province, especially in Yingjing and Gao counties. Due to the adoption of these methods, the development of local copper smelting industry in Sichuan Province has been extremely rapid. Within less than ten months, twenty-three copper factories have been built throughout the province, with an annual output far exceeding the copper production of local mines nationwide last year. These copper factories all use indigenous smelting methods, and the vast majority did not require state investment. All the technicians came from the local population. Some copper factories spent only 150 yuan and built copper smelting furnaces in a very short period of time, recovering all the investment in just one day of production.

　　Representatives from various provinces visited the newly built copper factories in Yingjing and Gao counties. The copper smelting furnaces in these two copper factories were all built with mud and stone, without using any steel. The factory buildings were only two or three bamboo sheds and thatched houses. Even with such simple equipment, they used indigenous methods to smelt copper, which people have always considered to require highly complex smelting technology. Currently, most provinces and regions in China's local copper smelting industry, except for Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and other provinces, have not yet started. The representatives believed that Sichuan Province's indigenous copper smelting is indeed a good method with low investment, quick results, and easy implementation and discontinuation. Under the current conditions of unclear non-ferrous metal resources, insufficient funds, lack of technical personnel, and mechanical manufacturing capacity not keeping up with the needs, it is the only correct path to seize the time, accelerate the speed, and promote the great leap forward of the local copper smelting industry.

　　This conference was convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry and other units from May 1st to 8th.

### 冶炼工业中的神秘观点一攻即破  土法炼铜上马如飞

　　冶炼工业中的神秘观点一攻即破
　　土法炼铜上马如飞
    据新华社成都11日电　发展地方炼铜工业应该走什么道路？最近在四川省高县召开的全国地方炼铜经验交流会及四川省炼铜会议，比较系统地总结了这方面的经验。
    这些经验主要是：以小型为主，实行边采边探边生产；因陋就简，就地取材，先搞生产性建设；寻找民间技术人才，加强技术人员与土专家的合作，运用学校教师等各种技术力量；根据资源、动力、交通条件，因地制宜、经济合理地安排生产规模与生产方法；在生产方法上，先土后洋，不断进行技术革新；发动群众办厂，依靠农业社供给劳动力等。
    这些经验是根据四川省，特别是荥经、高县两地发展地方炼铜工业的情况总结出来的。由于采取这些办法，四川省地方炼铜工业的发展极为迅速，在不到十个月时间内，全省建起了二十三座铜厂，年产量远远超过了去年全国地方矿山的产铜量。这些铜厂都是用土法冶炼，绝大部分没有要国家投资，技术人员全部来自民间。有的铜厂，只花一百五十元在很短的时间内建设起炼铜炉，仅仅生产一天就收回了全部投资。
    来自各省的代表，参观了荥经、高县新建的铜厂。这两个铜厂的炼铜炉全部是用泥、石建筑的，没有用半点钢铁，厂房也只是两、三间竹棚和草房。就是这样简陋的设备，却用土法炼出了人们一向认为冶炼技术相当复杂的铜来。目前我国地方炼铜工业，除了云南、四川、贵州等省以外，大部分省、区尚未开展。代表们认为，四川省的土法炼铜，的确是投资少、收效快、便于上马下马的好办法，在目前有色金属资源不清、资金不足、技术人才缺乏和机械制造力量赶不上需要的条件下，是争取时间，加快速度，推动地方炼铜工业大跃进的唯一正确道路。
    这次会议是冶金工业部和四川省工业厅等单位在5月1日到8日召开的。
