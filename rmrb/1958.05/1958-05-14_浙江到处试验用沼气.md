Zhejiang is Experimenting with Biogas Everywhere

　　Hangzhou, May 13th (from our newspaper) - People in Zhejiang Province are experimenting with the use of biogas everywhere. In addition to the forty biogas experimental stations run by various cities, special districts, and counties, there are also forty to fifty places where the masses are voluntarily contributing money to build biogas fermentation tanks.

　　Related units such as the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Applied Chemistry will send people to the countryside to focus on researching and building low-cost biogas fermentation tanks suitable for rural use.

　　Another dispatch: Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, uses the silt from years of accumulated ditch mud as the main raw material, and then mixes it with appropriate amounts of human and animal manure, weeds, and sewage. It is placed in a fermentation tank for fermentation, and a large amount of biogas is produced within fifteen days. A fermentation tank with a volume of thirteen cubic meters can produce enough biogas to light eleven biogas lamps, each equivalent to two hundred candlepower, for six hours a day. A pot of cold water weighing one catty can be brought to a boil in three minutes on a biogas stove. The Zhuji County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party attaches great importance to this new discovery and has decided to promote it throughout the county as a priority.

　　浙江到处试验用沼气
    本报杭州13日电　浙江省人民到处都在试验利用沼气。现在除各市、专区、县办的四十个沼气试验站外，又有四、五十处群众自发出钱兴建沼气发酵池。
    浙江省应用化学研究所等有关单位将派人到农村去，着重研究建造适合农村使用的造价低的沼气发酵池。
    又讯　浙江省诸暨县用淤积多年的阴沟泥为主要原料，再拌和适量的人畜粪便、杂草和污水，放在发酵池内发酵，在十五天内产生了大量沼气。一个十三立方公尺容积的发酵池，每天产生的沼气可供十一盏相当二百支光的沼气灯点六小时，一斤重的一壶冷水，放在沼气炉上，三分钟就可以沸腾。中共诸暨县委对这个新的发现十分重视，决定在全县重点推广。
