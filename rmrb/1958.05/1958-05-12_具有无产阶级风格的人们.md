　　People with Proletarian Style
　　It's nothing short of a miracle that a small, dilapidated cotton mill produced silk "Feili Silk," highly sought after in the international market, in just six days.

　　Over a hundred outdated looms, more than three hundred workers, and two ordinary technicians – that's all Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory had.

　　"Think about it, can we produce export products? This could earn foreign exchange for the country." One night in March this year, Wang Yu, the factory director with a worker background, discussed with Feng Shuzhen, the Party branch secretary, who said: "Good idea, let's try it. I also think it's not right to just follow the routine like this. To leap forward, we must be creative." They shared their ideas with relevant comrades, and everyone said in unison: "Great, let's do it!" The next day, Wang Yu led several workers to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and the Silk Company to find samples.

　　The staff of the Silk Company told them: "The 'Feili Silk' woven with native silk is especially popular in Southeast Asia. Currently, we don't have any factories in our country that weave silk with native silk. Our native silk is mostly exported in large quantities. The vast majority of Japan's 'Feili Silk' is made from our native silk." After the factory director returned and introduced the situation of "Feili Silk" to everyone, the workers discussed it heatedly:

　　"If no one else weaves it, we'll do it. What's so great about it!"

　　"Why should others weave our raw materials? We must produce it ourselves!"

　　"We have no fewer arms or legs than others. If they can weave it, so can we!"

　　"With brains, there's nothing we can't do."

　　The trial production began. The factory director convened a meeting of relevant personnel, laid out the trial production plan, and started working right away. Some bought native silk, some prepared the equipment, and some studied the samples of British "Feili Silk." They didn't even think about asking the higher authorities for personnel or money.

　　There were no available materials or experience to follow in the trial production of this product. They had no equipment, no technical personnel in this area, and the only reference was two small samples of "Feili Silk." Difficulties appeared one after another in front of the workers.

　　The first process was twisting the silk. But they didn't have a twisting machine, so two workers took two bundles of native silk to the Beijing Silk Thread Factory for processing and also learned the technology of operating the twisting machine themselves.

　　The most difficult part was dyeing the silk. Han Jiande, who was responsible for this work, thought in front of a pile of white silk thread: "Can we still rely on others? If we rely on them this time, we still won't know how to do it ourselves next time!" Jin Ruinian, a sizing and dyeing worker, also said: "We can't rely on others, let's try it ourselves. If we don't know, we'll ask others for guidance." They rode bicycles to the warehouse of the chemical dye company to find the colors, and then guarded the dyeing pot, without resting for two days and two nights, their eyes filled with red streaks. The first day they dyed it once and failed, so they dyed it again. After dyeing it twenty-one times in a row, it still wasn't successful. The next day, they went to ask experienced engineers for advice. They came back and dyed it again, and finally succeeded, with bright and non-fading colors.

　　Not knowing how to size the silk, factory director Wang Yu led some workers to the silk factory to learn the sizing technology. They saw that people were using manual operation, so they came back and started sizing it manually that night. Because the properties of the silk were different, the results were all stuck together. This was another extremely difficult problem. The workers in the iron workshop heard the news and said: "Don't be afraid, let's find a way to make a machine to size the silk." They knew that buying a sizing machine would cost a lot of money, so they found a broken sleying machine covered in rust in the scrap pile and converted it into a sizing machine. They also had no machine for winding the silk. The factory director and the workers studied together and found a few broken iron frames in the scrap pile and pieced them together to create a winding machine. The two machines cost only one hundred and twenty yuan.

　　Every process of the dyeing and finishing was overcome with great difficulty. Ding Yunhe, the director of the weaving workshop, worried that difficulties would arise again during the weaving process, so he carried his luggage from home to the workshop and stayed by the machine day and night until it was woven before leaving the workshop.

　　In this way, after six days and nights of hard work, "Feili Silk," a product that had never been produced in our country, was successfully trial-produced. The samples were taken to the Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou not long ago and were greatly welcomed by foreign merchants. The 500,000 meters to be exported this year can earn 750,000 US dollars in foreign exchange. These US dollars can buy six hundred and thirty-three fully automated silk weaving machines. Due to the large-scale production of "Feili Silk" this year, the output value of this factory has jumped from four million yuan to eight million two hundred thousand yuan.

　　Now that the trial production stage is quickly entering the stage of mass production, can they apply to the higher authorities for subsidies? No! Like during the trial production, they are still working hard and diligently, not asking the higher authorities for personnel or money. They solve the problems themselves as much as possible. Without a workshop, they vacated the large office, and the management cadres squeezed into a small room to work. Without machines, Deputy Factory Director Shi Jiaguo led three or four workers to search for broken machines and parts in the scrap yards of many brother factories. They have now collected a large pile, ready to repair and convert them for mass production of "Feili Silk."

　　Dear readers! This is not just the story of the birth of "Feili Silk," this is the style and image of proletarian fighters, this is the victory of the great rectification movement.

　　具有无产阶级风格的人们
    一个破破烂烂的织棉布的小工厂，六天织成了深受国际市场欢迎的丝制“飞利绸”，这不能不说是奇迹。
    一百多台陈旧的织布机，三百多个职工，两个普通的技术人员，这就是北京市染织第一厂的一切。
    “想一想，咱们能不能搞出口产品？这能为国家换回外汇。”今年3月的一个深夜里，这个工厂工人出身的厂长王瑜有和党支部书记冯树桢商量，冯树桢说：“好啊，试一试。我也想，光这样按部就班的不行，要跃进，就得要有创造性。”他们把自己的想法和有关同志一谈，大家异口同声地说：“好，干！”第二天，王瑜有就带着几个职工，到对外贸易部、丝绸公司找样品去了。
    丝绸公司的工作人员告诉他们说：用土丝织成的“飞利绸”，在东南亚特别受欢迎，现在我们国家没有用土丝织绸的工厂，我们的土丝都大量出口了。日本的“飞利绸”绝大多数是用的我们的土丝。厂长回来向大家介绍了“飞利绸”的情况后，职工们议论纷纷：
    “没人织，我们干，有什么了不起！”
    “我们的原料，为什么叫人家织布？咱们非搞成不可！”
    “咱也不少胳臂，也不少腿，别人能织我们也能织！”
    “有个脑瓜子，没有办不成的事。”
    试制工作开始了。厂长召集有关人员开了一个会，订出了试制计划，说干就干了起来。有的买土丝；有的作设备方面的准备；有的研究英国的“飞利绸”样品。向上级要人要钱的事他们连想也没有想。
    试制这种产品，既无资料可查，又无经验可循，自己没设备，也没有这方面的技术人材，唯一可参考的只有两小块“飞利绸”的样品。困难一个接着一个地出现在职工们的面前。
    第一个工序是拈丝。但是他们没有拈丝机，两个职工就带着两包袱土丝，到北京丝线厂加了工，自己也学到了操纵拈丝机的技术。
    最难的是染丝。负责这个工作的韩健德在一大堆白色的丝线面前想：“这还能再依靠别人吗？这次靠人家，下次自己还是不会！”浆染工人靳瑞年也说：“不能靠别人，自己试试看，不会向人家请教。”他们骑着自行车到化学染料公司的仓库里去找到了颜色，回来后就守候着染锅，两天两夜没有休息，眼睛里布满了红丝。第一天染一次不成，就再染一次，一连染了二十一次，还没成功。第二天，他们又去找有经验的工程师请教。回来又染，最后终于染成了，颜色鲜艳不褪色。
    不会浆丝，厂长王瑜有就领着一些工人到丝厂去学习浆丝技术。他们看到人家用手工操作，自己当晚回来也用手工来浆了起来，因为丝的性能不一样，结果都粘在一起了。这又是个极大的难题。铁工部的工人们听到这个消息后说：“不怕，想法搞个机器来浆丝。”他们知道买部浆丝机要用很多钱，就在废铁堆里找出了一个生满铁锈的破打经机，改装成了浆丝机。络丝他们也没有机器，厂长和工人们一起研究，又在废铁堆里找了几个破铁架子，拚凑起来，造成了络丝机。两台机器只花了一百二十元。
    染整过程的每个工序在重重困难中度过了，织布车间主任丁云和耽心在织的过程中再发生困难，就背着行李从家里搬到车间住宿，日夜守候在机器旁边，直到织成才离开车间。
    就这样，经过六昼夜的苦干，我国从未有过的产品“飞利绸”，就试制成功了。样品拿到不久前在广州举行的出口商品展览会后，受到外国商人极大欢迎。今年即将出口的五十万公尺，可换回外汇七十五万美金。这些美金可买六百三十三台全部自动化的织绸机。由于“飞利绸”今年大批投入生产，这个工厂的产值由四百万元一跃而为八百二十万元。
    现在，由试制阶段快进入大批生产的阶段，可以向上级申请补助了吧？不！他们和试制时一样，还是穷干苦干，不向上级要人要钱，凡能自己解决的问题就自己解决。没有车间，把大办公室腾出来，管理干部们挤在一个小屋子里办公。没有机器，副厂长石嘉国领着三、四个工人到很多兄弟工厂的废品库去搜罗破机器、破零件，现在已搜罗了一大堆，准备修理改装后，用来大批生产“飞利绸”。
    亲爱的读者！这不只是“飞利绸”诞生的故事，这是无产阶级战士的风格和形象，这是伟大的整风运动的胜利。
