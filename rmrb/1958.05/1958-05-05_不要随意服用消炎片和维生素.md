    Don't Take Anti-inflammatory Pills and Vitamins Casually

    Anti-inflammatory pills (also known as sulfathiazole tablets or Sulfa drugs) are a relatively common drug with antipyretic effects. However, the dosage must be strictly controlled when using this drug to treat patients. This is because the drug's effect on bacteria is not to kill them, but to inhibit their reproduction. If the dosage is inappropriate and prolonged, the bacteria will develop resistance, rendering the drug ineffective. Some bacteria even become dependent on the drug, using it as a source of sustenance. This can lead to poisoning or drug resistance. Sometimes patients question doctors about why the drug is ineffective, but after repeated questioning by the doctor, it is often found that the patient had taken the drug themselves before consulting the doctor.

    Vitamins should also not be taken indiscriminately. The amount of various vitamins our bodies need is very small, only a few tens of milligrams per day (one gram equals one thousand milligrams), or even a few tens of micrograms (one milligram equals one thousand micrograms). The amount of vitamins contained in the food we eat every day is generally sufficient, and there is no need to supplement with vitamin preparations. Taking too much water-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin B, vitamin C, and anti-pellagra vitamins) is useless to the body and will simply be excreted. Taking too much fat-soluble vitamins (such as vitamin A and vitamin D) can cause poisoning, such as eye inflammation and hair loss.

### 不要随意服用消炎片和维生素

    不要随意服用消炎片和维生素
    消炎片（又叫磺胺噻唑片或消治龙片）是一种比较普通的药物，有退热功效。可是在应用这种药物治疗病人的过程中，必须严格控制用量。因为这药对病菌的作用不是杀灭，而是抑制病菌的繁殖，如果药量用得不当，日子一久，病菌就会产生抵抗力，使药物失去作用，甚至有的病菌还产生依赖性，把药物作为它的生活资料。这样，不是引起中毒，就是产生抗药性。有时病人责问医生说为什么吃了这药无效，可是当医生一再追问，往往原因就是病人在找医生之前自己服用过这药了。
    维生素也不能滥服。我们体内所需要的各种维生素量是很少的，每日只需几十毫克（一克等于一千毫克），甚至几十微克（一毫克等于一千微克）。我们每天吃下去的食物所含的维生素量，一般都是够需要了，没有必要再补充维生素制剂。水溶性维生素（如乙种维生素、丙种维生素、抗癞皮病维生素等）吃得太多，对身体毫无用处，结果白白排泄掉。脂溶性维生素（如甲种维生素、丁种维生素等）吃得太多，就要引起中毒，如发生眼炎、毛发脱落等。
