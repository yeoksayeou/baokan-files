Xinhua News Agency, New York, 15th dispatch: The American industrial production continued to decline in April. According to the Federal Reserve Board's announcement on the 14th, the US industrial production index for April was 126 (with the average for 1947-1949 as 100), a decrease of two points compared to March of this year, a decrease of seventeen points compared to April of last year, and a decrease of twenty-one points compared to the peak in December 1956.

The Federal Reserve Board stated that the April industrial production index was the lowest since October 1954. Including April, US industrial production has declined for eight consecutive months.

The decline in US industrial production in April was mainly due to reduced production in the durable goods sector and the mining sector. For example, due to overproduction, the steel industry and non-ferrous metal manufacturing industry are both cutting production.

The US Gross National Product is also declining. The Commerce Department announced on the 13th that in the first quarter of this year, the annual rate of total US output of goods and services was 422 billion US dollars, which is 2 billion US dollars less than the original estimate of Eisenhower's Economic Advisory Committee. It is said that since this economic crisis began last fall, the US Gross National Product has decreased by more than 4%, while in the two economic recessions of 1948-1949 and 1953-1954, the US Gross National Product only decreased by about 3%.

The situation of US foreign trade also illustrates the unfavorable state of the US economy. The Commerce Department announced on the 14th that in February of this year, US commodity imports were only over 950 million US dollars, a decrease of 5% compared to February of last year, and a decrease of 14% compared to January of this year, with raw material imports decreasing the most severely.

Due to the continuous news of economic deterioration, the New York stock market was very chaotic on the 14th, and the average price of stocks fell to the lowest point since December 1957.

Amidst the overall decline in the US economy, the only thing that has continued to rise is the cost of living index. According to a report released by the National Industrial Conference Board on the 14th, if the 1953 level is taken as 100, the US cost of living index rose to a peak of 107.2 in April of this year, an increase of 3.2% compared to April of last year, of which food prices rose by 7%. Due to the rising cost of living, the lives of the American working people have become even more difficult.

　　美经济危机越陷越深
    四月份工业生产降到五年来最低点
    新华社15日讯　纽约消息：美国工业生产4月份继续下降。据联邦储备局14日宣布，4月份美国工业生产指数是一百二十六（以1947—1949年的平均数为一百），比今年3月份下降了二点，比去年4月份下降了十七点，比1956年12月的最高峰下降了二十一点。
    联邦储备局说，4月份的工业生产指数是1954年10月以来最低的，连同4月份在内，美国工业生产已经连续下降了八个月。
    4月份美国工业生产下降主要是由于耐用品部门和矿业部门生产减少。例如由于生产过剩，钢铁工业和非铁金属制造业都在削减生产。
    美国国民生产总值也在下降中。商务部13日宣布，在今年头一季，美国货物和劳务的总产量的年率为四千二百二十亿美元，比艾森豪威尔的经济顾问委员会原来的估计少二十亿美元。据说，自从这次经济危机在去年秋季开始以来，美国国民生产总值已经减少了4％以上，而在1948—1949年和1953—1954年的两次经济衰退中，美国国民生产总值只下降3％左右。
    美国的对外贸易情况也说明了美国经济情况的不妙。商务部14日宣布，今年2月份美国商品输入只有九亿五千多万美元，比去年2月份减少5％，比今年1月份下降14％，其中原料输入减少得最为严重。
    由于经济恶化的消息纷纷传来，纽约股票市场14日十分混乱，股票的平均价格跌到1957年12月以来的最低点。
    在美国经济一片下跌声中，唯一连续上升的是生活费用指数。据美国全国工业会议委员会14日发表的报告，如果以1953年的水平为一百，今年4月份美国的生活费用指数上升到一百零七点二的高峰，比去年4月份上涨了3.2％，其中食品价格上涨了7％。由于生活费用上涨，美国劳动人民的生活进一步困难。
