Xinhua News Agency, Tashkent, May 5th: According to TASS, a mass rally of representatives from all walks of life in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, was held on the 4th at the National Opera and Ballet Theatre to welcome the President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser. Nasser arrived in Tashkent on May 3rd from Moscow for a visit.

President Nasser spoke at the meeting. He emphasized the friendship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, as well as the imperialist oppression and deception suffered by his country. Nasser said that when our revolution took place in 1952, our primary task was to get rid of British occupation in order to gain freedom and be able to freely interact with countries around the world.

He recounted that in February 1954, the then British Prime Minister, Mr. Eden, tried to persuade us that we should form an alliance with Britain in order to resist aggression from the Soviet Union. We rejected this alliance, saying: How can we be sure that Britain will not invade us? Mr. Eden said at the time that this was impossible and that aggression would only come from the Soviet Union. President Nasser continued, but two years later, in 1956, Britain invaded Egypt, and the head of the British government at this time was still Mr. Eden. As for the Soviet Union, it stood by us and supported us in repelling this imperialist aggression.

Nasser said that the friendship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is based on the common interests of developing the national economy, opposing aggression, and opposing imperialism. We have received tremendous assistance from the Soviet Union to shatter the economic blockade that imperialism attempted to impose on us, and we have received your assistance to develop our economy and implement the industrialization of our country.

Nasser said that when we received economic assistance and support from you to implement our industrialization, Britain, this imperialist country, was attacking those Arab countries that are still weak. Imperialism sees Israel as a springboard in this region to force Arab countries to join military blocs when it carries out its adventures.

Nasser said that when he visited the Soviet Union, he saw that all parts of the Soviet Union were filled with a desire for cooperation. He also said that friendship and cooperation with the Soviet Union have made our country a strong and independent country, and strengthened our efforts for world peace.

Rashidov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek Republic, also spoke at the meeting. He highly praised the struggle of the people of the Arab East for freedom, and emphasized that the basis of the friendship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is that they have common interests in opposing colonialism, opposing any form of national oppression, striving for friendship between all peoples, striving for peace, and striving for sincere and selfless cooperation and mutual assistance on the basis of equality.

    纳赛尔在塔什干群众欢迎大会上说
    苏联是朋友　帝国主义是敌人
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社塔什干讯：乌兹别克首都塔什干各界代表4日在国立歌舞剧院举行群众大会，欢迎阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔。纳赛尔是5月3日从莫斯科到塔什干来访问的。
    纳赛尔总统在会上讲了话。他着重谈到苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊以及他的国家身受的帝国主义压迫和欺诈。纳赛尔说，在1952年我国发生革命时，我们首要的任务就是摆脱英国占领，以便获得自由，能够同世界各国自由交往。
    他追述说，1954年2月，英国当时的首相艾登先生企图说服我们，说我们应当同英国结成联盟，才能抵抗来自苏联的侵略。我们拒绝了这种联盟，我们说：怎么见得英国不会来侵略我们呢？艾登先生当时说，这是不可能的，侵略只会来自苏联。纳赛尔总统接着说，可是过了两年，到1956年，英国就来侵略埃及了，这时英国政府的首脑仍然是那位艾登先生。至于苏联，它却站在我们这边，支持我们击退这次帝国主义侵略。
    纳赛尔说，苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊是以发展民族经济、反对侵略、反对帝国主义方面的利益的共同性为基础的。我们从苏联获得了巨大的援助来粉碎帝国主义企图给我们制造的经济封锁，我们得到你们的援助来发展我国的经济和实行我们国家的工业化。
    纳赛尔说，当我们从你们那里获得经济援助和支持来实行我国工业化的时候，英国这个帝国主义国家却在进攻那些现在还软弱的阿拉伯国家。帝国主义进行冒险的时候把以色列看成是在这个地区迫使阿拉伯国家参加军事集团的跳板。
    纳赛尔说，当他在苏联访问的时候，看到苏联各地都充满着实行合作的愿望。他还说，同苏联的友谊和合作使我国成为一个强大独立的国家，并且加强我们对世界和平的努力。
    乌兹别克共和国最高苏维埃主席团主席拉希多夫也在会上讲了话。他十分称赞阿拉伯东方人民争取自由的斗争，并且强调指出苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊的基础是：它们在反对殖民主义、反对任何形式的民族压迫、争取各国人民之间的友谊、争取和平、争取在平等的基础上实行真诚无私的合作和互助的事业中有共同的利益。
