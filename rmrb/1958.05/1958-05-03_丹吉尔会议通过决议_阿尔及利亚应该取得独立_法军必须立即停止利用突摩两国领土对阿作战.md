Xinhua News Agency, Tangier, 1st dispatch: The leaders of the three main political organizations of North African countries—the Moroccan Istiqlal Party (the ruling party), the Tunisian Neo Destour Party (the ruling party), and the Algerian National Liberation Front—held a four-day meeting in Tangier from April 27th to 30th. This was the first formal meeting between the major political organizations of these countries.

It is reported that the conference discussed the following issues: "The Algerian war of independence," "Eliminating the remaining colonial rule in North African countries," and "The unification of Arab North Africa."

The resolution issued after the meeting stated: The Algerian people have an inalienable right to achieve sovereignty and independence, which is the only condition for resolving the French-Algerian conflict.

The resolution called on "certain Western countries and NATO countries" to stop providing France with any political and material assistance "that is destined to prolong the colonial war in Arab North Africa."

The resolution also demanded that the French army immediately stop using the territories of Tunisia and Morocco to fight Algeria, and believed that maintaining foreign troops in Morocco and Tunisia is incompatible with the sovereignty and independence of these two countries.

The resolution also suggested the establishment of an Algerian government, and emphasized that the Algerian National Liberation Front is "the sole representative of Algeria in the war."

The resolution stated that North African countries will establish a "North African Federation." During the "transitional phase" before the establishment of the "North African Federation," a "North African Consultative Assembly" will be established, composed of the parliaments of Morocco and Tunisia and the "Algerian National Revolutionary Council."

The resolution also expressed support for the residents of Mauritania in French West Africa "in their struggle to get rid of colonial rule and merge with Morocco."

The conference decided to establish a permanent secretariat to ensure the implementation of the above resolutions. The secretariat will be attended by representatives from Tunisia, Morocco, and the Algerian National Liberation Front. Its two headquarters will be located in Tunis and Rabat.

It can be seen from the reports of Western news agencies that this conference has caused alarm and unease among Western colonialists, especially French colonialists.

    丹吉尔会议通过决议
    阿尔及利亚应该取得独立
    法军必须立即停止利用突摩两国领土对阿作战
    据新华社1日讯　丹吉尔消息：北非国家的三个主要政治组织——摩洛哥独立党（执政党）、突尼斯新宪政党（执政党）和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的领袖们从4月27日到30日在丹吉尔举行了四天的会议。这是这些国家中的主要政治组织之间所举行的第一次正式会议。
    据报道，这次会议讨论了下列几个问题：“阿尔及利亚的独立战争问题”，“消除北非各国的殖民统治残余问题”以及“阿拉伯北非的统一问题”。
    会后发表的决议说：阿尔及利亚人民有取得主权和独立的不容转让的权利，这是解决法国—阿尔及利亚冲突的唯一条件。
    决议呼吁“某些西方国家和北大西洋公约组织国家”停止给予法国一切“注定会延长阿拉伯北非的殖民战争的”政治和物质援助。
    决议还要求法国军队立即停止利用突尼斯和摩洛哥的领土对阿尔及利亚作战，并且认为，在摩洛哥和突尼斯维持外国军队是同这两个国家的主权和独立不相容的。
    决议还建议成立一个阿尔及利亚政府，并且强调说，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线是“战争中的阿尔及利亚的唯一代表”。
    决议说，北非国家将成立一个“北非联邦”。在“北非联邦”成立之前的“过渡阶段”，将成立一个“北非谘询议会”，由摩洛哥和突尼斯的议会和“阿尔及利亚革命民族委员会”组成。
    决议还表示支持法属西非洲的毛里塔尼亚居民“争取摆脱殖民主义统治和同摩洛哥合并的斗争”。
    会议决定成立一个常设秘书处来保证上述决议的执行。参加秘书处的有突尼斯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线的代表。它的两个总部将分设在突尼斯和拉巴特。
    从西方通讯社的报道中可以看出，这次会议引起了西方殖民主义者，特别是法国殖民主义者的惊惶和不安。
