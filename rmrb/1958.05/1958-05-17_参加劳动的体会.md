Experiences of Participating in Labor
Beijing Medical College Associate Professor Lin Chuanxiang

    I am an intellectual who came from the old society. In the past, I always believed that mental laborers were superior. This time, participating in the voluntary labor of building the Ming Tombs Reservoir was truly the best lesson in socialism.

    In labor, collectivist ideology and individualist ideology constantly unfolded in fierce struggles, and this struggle was very concrete and realistic. For example, when carrying earth, as soon as I thought about the benefits the early completion of the Ming Tombs Reservoir would bring to the country and the people, my enthusiasm for labor increased, I forgot my fatigue, and my work efficiency greatly improved. If I was thinking about myself everywhere, I would not be willing to carry more earth, and I would not have the spirit of courageously moving forward.

    In labor, I personally saw the selfless spirit of the People's Liberation Army soldiers and farmers who went wherever they were needed for socialist construction. They despised difficulties and hardships and did not care about personal gains or losses. This high degree of socialist consciousness deeply moved me. It is really shameful for intellectuals to take knowledge as their own and haggle over personal gains and losses.

    Through this labor experience, I am even more confident and determined to transform myself and become an intellectual who is both red and expert.

　　参加劳动的体会
    北京医学院副教授　林传骧
    我是从旧社会来的知识分子。过去总认为脑力劳动者要高人一等。这次参加修建十三陵水库的义务劳动，真是上了一堂最好的社会主义课。
    在劳动中，集体主义思想和个人主义思想不断地展开激烈的斗争，这种斗争非常具体而现实。例如在挑土时，一想到十三陵水库早日建成给国家和人民带来的好处，劳动劲头就大，疲劳也忘了，工作效率大大提高。如果是处处想到个人，挑土就不愿多挑，也就没有勇往直前的精神。
    在劳动中，我亲眼看到解放军战士和农民们为了社会主义建设，那里需要，就到那里去的忘我精神。他们藐视艰难困苦，不计较个人的得失。这种高度的社会主义觉悟，使我深受感动。知识分子把知识据为己有，斤斤计较个人得失，实在可耻。
    通过这次劳动锻炼，使我更加有信心和决心改造自己，成为又红又专的知识分子。
