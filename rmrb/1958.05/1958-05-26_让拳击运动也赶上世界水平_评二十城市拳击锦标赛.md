    Let Boxing Catch Up with the World Level
    ——A Review of the Twenty Cities Boxing Championship
    Wu Jiangping
    The National Twenty Cities Boxing Competition concluded yesterday. This competition was a major review of the strength of China's boxing, and at the same time, it played a significant role in promoting the more widespread development of this sport in the future.
    Boxing is considered a new sport in China. Since liberation, only four national-level competitions have been held. The first competition held in 1953 only had twenty-seven athletes, while this Twenty Cities Competition had one hundred and forty-two athletes. This shows that this sport has gradually developed in various regions and has a relatively broad mass base.
    Because of the broad mass base, the level of boxing has also greatly improved. It is very obvious from this competition that the boxing athletes have made significant progress in technique. In previous competitions, many athletes, due to not having undergone strict training, did not use tactics when fighting, but just wildly swung their fists. That kind of reckless action rarely occurred this time; athletes generally knew how to use tactics to attack their opponents, especially those with more experience. The athletes' physical strength has also improved significantly. The vast majority of athletes were able to complete all three rounds.
    The emergence of a large number of young boxing newcomers is a major feature of this competition. Of all one hundred and forty-two athletes, more than half participated in a national competition for the first time, and 95% were young people under the age of twenty-five. More than half of the champions and runners-up in the ten weight divisions of this competition were newcomers. Wang Chunnian from Tianjin, who won the light flyweight champion, is a middle school student. Li Guoji from Shenyang defeated Xu Liansheng, who had won the flyweight title for two consecutive terms. The emergence of new talents shows that our boxing potential is quite strong.
    After all, boxing is still a new sport in China, so many shortcomings in training and technique were also exposed in this competition. These all need to be improved in the future. A very obvious shortcoming is that athletes lack a foundation of comprehensive physical training. Some athletes have a certain level of technique, but their physical strength and endurance are not good enough. For example, Wang Shouxin, who has won the light flyweight champion four times including this time, has poor physical strength and endurance. At the same time, some athletes have good physical strength, but the speed of their punches and the agility of their bodies are somewhat lacking. Therefore, the training of boxing athletes must focus on strengthening comprehensive physical training to improve the athletes' physical qualities. Because the athletes' basic technical training is not yet sufficient, the correctness of the punching route and posture is also not good enough. In this way, they cannot accurately hit the opponent, cannot coordinate footwork with punching, and cannot correctly block and quickly dodge. This is also one of the shortcomings exposed this time. Excellent boxers are good at using their intelligence, using feinting movements to confuse opponents, and using alternating feints and real attacks, and attacking from the east and west, to find gaps for quick attacks. When encountering unfavorable situations, they quickly jump out or dodge. Many of our athletes are somewhat lacking in this regard. Their strategic and tactical changes are very few during the competition. Other shortcomings, such as athletes being impatient during the competition, wasting physical strength unnecessarily, having stiff footwork or jumping too much, only punching with a single fist, and simply adopting offensive tactics, should also be vigorously improved in training.
    Judging from this competition, China's boxing has reached a certain level. It is hoped that boxing athletes will make another effort, and it is entirely possible to catch up with the world level in a short period of time.

### 让拳击运动也赶上世界水平——评二十城市拳击锦标赛

    让拳击运动也赶上世界水平
    ——评二十城市拳击锦标赛
    吴江平
    全国二十城市拳击比赛昨天结束了。这次比赛的举行对我国的拳击运动实力是一次大检阅，同时，对今后比较广泛地开展这项运动也起了很大的推动作用。
    拳击运动在我国算是一个新的项目。解放后，一共只举行过四次全国性的比赛。1953年举行的第一次比赛，只有二十七名运动员参加，而这次二十城市比赛就有一百四十二名运动员了。这说明这项运动已逐步在各地展开，并已有了比较广泛的群众基础。
    因为有了广泛的群众基础，拳击运动水平也有了很大的提高。从这次比赛可以很明显地看出：拳击运动员们在技术上有了显著的进步。在过去的几次比赛中，不少运动员由于没有经过严格的训练，打起来不运用战术，只是挥拳乱抡、蛮干。而这次很少出现那种蛮干现象了，运动员们普遍地知道运用战术来进攻对方，特别是那些比较有经验的运动员。运动员的体力也有很显著的进步。绝大多数运动员都能坚持打完三个回合。
    大批的年轻拳击新手的涌现是这次比赛的一个很大的特点。在全部一百四十二名运动员中，有一半以上是第一次参加全国性比赛，有95％是二十五岁以下的青年。获得这次比赛十个级别冠亚军中，有一半以上是新手。夺得这次次最轻级冠军的王春年就是天津的一个中学生。沈阳的李国济，这次击败了曾连获二届次轻级冠军的许连生。新手人材辈出，这说明了我们拳击运动的潜力是相当雄厚的。
    毕竟拳击运动在我国还是一个新项目，所以在这次比赛中也暴露出不少训练和技术上的缺点。这都需要今后注意改进。很明显的一个缺点，就是运动员们缺乏身体全面训练的基础。有的运动员技术有一定水平但体力和耐久力不够好。如连这次共获得四次最轻级冠军的王守忻就是体力和耐久力差。同时，有些运动员体力不错而出拳的速度和身体的灵敏性又差一些。因此对于拳击运动员的训练上必须要着重加强身体的全面训练，以提高运动员的身体素质。由于运动员基本技术训练还不够，击拳的路线和动作姿式的正确性也还不够。这样就不能准确地击打对方，就不能使步法同拳法协调起来，也就不能正确地阻挡和灵敏快速地闪躲。这也是这次暴露出的缺点之一。优秀的拳击手，都善于斗智，用虚晃的动作，迷惑对手，用虚实交错和声东击西的动作，找到空隙快速进攻，遇不利时，快速跃出或闪躲。我们不少运动员在这方面就显得差一些。他们在比赛时，战略战术的变化很少。其他，像运动员在比赛时情绪急躁、无益地消耗体力，步法呆板或跳动过多，只会单拳击打和单纯采用进攻战术等缺点也是在训练中应该亟力改进的。
    从这次比赛来看，我国拳击运动已有了一定的水平。希望拳击运动员们再努一把力，在不长的时间内赶上世界水平那是完全可能的。
