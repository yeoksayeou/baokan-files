　　Strive for a bumper harvest of late rice
　　Guangdong promotes new technologies; Guangxi popularizes improved varieties
　　This newspaper reports that Guangdong Province has launched a high tide of summer planting and preparation work centered on the promotion of new technologies, striving for a bumper harvest of late-season rice.
　　Guangdong Province is focusing on early sowing, sparse sowing, and early seedling cultivation this year, cultivating strong and healthy seedlings to adapt to the high temperature and humidity environment of late-season rice and to extend the growing period of late rice, thereby increasing yields. Currently, the entire province has entered the peak season for sowing, with many areas having already sown over 70% of their crops, and it is expected that sowing will be completed before the "Grain in Ear" solar term. This is one to two solar terms earlier than the same period last year.
　　This year, all regions are paying attention to adopting high-yield and good-quality varieties, mainly local high-yield and good-quality varieties, and trying to introduce high-yield varieties from other regions to strive for the province-wide use of improved varieties for late-season rice this year.
　　The comprehensive promotion of close planting and strict adherence to technical specifications in all work is a major feature of this year's summer planting and preparation work in Guangdong Province. This year's late-season rice requires a comprehensive planting density of 35,000 to 40,000 plants per mu, which is two to three times more than last year. Leaders at all levels are further using methods such as demonstrations, visits, debates, and evaluations to resolve the conservative thinking of some cadres and masses. Many areas have also held technical training courses to teach the operational procedures of late-season rice cultivation technology to ensure that sowing work is carried out 100% according to technical specifications.

　　This newspaper reports that the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has taken various measures to popularize improved varieties to ensure the completion of this year's grain production increase plan. Of the more than 13 million mu of early rice that has already been planted, 75% of the fields have promoted more than 30 kinds of improved varieties such as "Dwarf Sticky," "Ma Fang Sticky," and "Liberation No. 1." Currently, the more than 14 million mu of late rice that is beginning to be sown in various places will basically popularize improved varieties. Among them, the high-yield improved variety of japonica rice, which has been successfully tested in Baise, Yishan, Pingle and other regions for the past two years, has recently been transferred out of more than 10 million catties to support major rice-producing areas, and a large number of high-yield and high-quality late rice seeds have also been transferred in from Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guizhou and other provinces.
　　In order to rapidly popularize improved varieties, the autonomous region has basically achieved the establishment of improved variety breeding farms in every county and seed retention fields in every commune. (Li Yifang) (Attached picture)
　　The Rocket Commune in Chongxing Township, Pixian County, Sichuan Province, increased rapeseed production by 74.8% this year compared to last year. More than 95% of the women members of the commune participated in the harvesting activities.

    争取晚稻大丰收
    广东推行新技术　广西普及良种
    本报讯　广东省全面掀起了以推行新技术为中心的夏种备耕工作高潮，争取晚造水稻大丰收。
    广东省今年抓紧早播、疏播和播早秧，培育老健壮秧，以适应晚造温高水热的环境和延长晚稻生长期，提高产量。目前，全省已进入播种大忙，不少地区已播下70％以上，预计在“芒种”前可全部播种完毕。比去年同期提早一个到两个节气。
    今年，各地都注意采用高产良种，以本地高产良种为主，尽量引种外地高产品种，争取今年晚造做到全省良种化。
    全面推广密植、一切工作按技术规格办事，这是今年广东省夏种备耕工作的一大特点。今年晚造全面要求每亩插植三万五千到四万株，比去年增加两倍到三倍。各级领导正进一步运用示范、参观、辩论、评比的方法，解决部分干部和群众的保守思想。不少地区并举办了技术训练班，讲授晚稻栽培技术操作规程，以保证播种工作百分之百地按技术规格进行。（郑世文）
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区采取各种措施普及良种，以保证完成今年的粮食增产计划。已经插上的一千三百多万亩早稻，有75％的田推广了“矮仔粘”、“马房粘”和“解放一号”等三十多种良种。目前各地开始播种的一千四百多万亩晚稻，将基本普及良种。其中百色、宜山、平乐等专区两年来试验成功的高产良种粳稻，最近已调运出一千多万斤，支援主要稻产区，还从湖北、湖南、广东、贵州等省调入大批产量高、品质优良的晚稻种。
    为了迅速普及良种，自治区已经基本做到县县建立良种繁殖场，社社有留种田。　（李益芳）（附图片）
