    Three Days and Three Nights of Flowing Water
    ——The Story of a Female County Head Governing Water
    By Our Correspondent Jin Feng
    As soon as the meeting at the sluice gate ended, Zhang Xiubin, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, Xu Zhiying, Deputy County Head, and Lao Ma, a member of the County Party Committee, along with Lao Liang and Lao Gui from the Engineering Section, immediately set off in different directions, following the flow of water along the South Branch Canal.
    Xu Zhiying and Lao Liang were together. As usual, she walked quickly, taking large strides, so that Lao Liang could hardly keep up with her. She frowned slightly, pursed her lips, and her face was filled with the determined look of someone who was determined to work hard. Originally, it had been hard to mobilize over one million cubic meters of earthwork within a month to repair the canal, preparing to reclaim wasteland and wash away alkali. But the water was disobedient and difficult to control. The 100,000 mu of low-lying alkaline land, prepared for rice planting, still lay there with a pale face. And the painstakingly cultivated green rice seedlings were about to wither. She must follow the water closely, find out the water release rules of the entire canal system, and make the water of the South Grand Canal obediently flow to the low-lying land waiting to be reclaimed and have its alkali washed away, so that Qing County, Hebei, could plant 100,000 mu of rice!
    Planting 100,000 mu of rice was the way for Qing County to change from poverty to prosperity! Liu Zhiying’s mind flashed with the passionate words of Liu Jingshan, a 63-year-old man from Liuquetun: "If Qing County doesn’t change its planting methods for one year, it will be poor for one year; if it doesn’t change for ten years, it will be poor for ten years; if it doesn’t change for a lifetime, it will be poor for a lifetime!" How eagerly the people wanted to get rid of their impoverished fate! She also remembered the many pairs of expectant eyes that bid her farewell when she came to the countryside a month ago: "We are waiting to eat your rice!" However, she also clearly saw those few pairs of suspicious, mocking eyes flashing past: "Let's see what you can make out of it!" She had sworn at that time: "If rice planting is successful east of the Grand Canal, it will open the door for Qing County to change from poverty to prosperity. If rice planting is not successful in 1958, I will have no face to go to the east of the canal again and will have to grow dry crops west of the canal!" Now, it was almost time to reclaim wasteland and transplant seedlings, but they didn't know how to release the water!
    Xu Zhiying followed the water closely all the way, along the branch canals, along the ditch canals, and along the furrows to the fields. She carefully observed the water flow and the terrain, and recorded the time each canal took to flow through. Unconsciously, she arrived at Xiawu Village.
    She heard a burst of noise from the control gate at the entrance of the village, and several people seemed to be arguing. She went closer and saw that Zhang Mingde, the deputy director of Qinghezhuang, was red in the face, shouting at Yang Xiulin, the branch secretary of Xiawu Village: "Are you going to raise the gate for me?" Yang Xiulin sneered slightly: "You pay for it, you raise the gate. If you don't pay, the ownership of this gate belongs to us!" "You repaired the gate, and we also dug the canal," Zhang Mingde, wearing an old military uniform, was particularly impatient and had a loud voice. He saw Xu Zhiying at a glance and quickly said: "County Head Xu is here, come and judge who is right and who is wrong. The gate is built in their village, so they won't release water to our village!" Xu Zhiying knew that Qinghezhuang had given Xiawu Village less land in exchange when the canal was built, and they were unwilling to pay when the gate was repaired, so Xiawu Village was holding back and not releasing water to Qinghezhuang.
    She smiled and mediated between the two families: "The gate and the canal are still used by both families. In a few days, when you go to repair the Wangjiagou, Qinghezhuang will send thirty more people, which is equivalent to exchanging labor for Xiawu Village. The two families are not allowed to complain any more."
    From Xiawu to Qinghezhuang, she carefully inspected all the canals. That afternoon, she rushed back to the Zhouguantun main gate and checked the situation with Zhang Xiubin and the others. That night, she and Xiubin rushed to Daduzhuang together.
    As they walked to the edge of the village, they saw water in the spring wheat fields. Xu Zhiying said, "How did the water get here?" At this time, they also heard the people in the depression shouting in a mess: "Why is the water coming so fast?" "It must be that the water was released too much at the gate!" They only saw a sea of lights in the depression, with lanterns running back and forth, like fiery dragons. The people were holding torches and rushing to reclaim wasteland and water the land overnight.
    Xu Zhiying realized that the water was too high and rushed to the gate to take a look. The reed gate had indeed been washed away by the water. She quickly joined Xiubin in holding up the gate, while urgently sending people to call the cooperative cadres and sending people to Dahu Village to close the gate above. The water gradually subsided.
    "Luckily you came, otherwise, the entire depression would have been flooded. What seedlings could we transplant, what rice could we grow?!" The people were complaining that none of the cooperative cadres were guarding the gate.
    "Listen to me, you should have stayed here, don't run around!" Xu Zhiying criticized Chen Jinqing, the deputy director of the cooperative, who was panting as he ran over. With the flooding of the water, half of the production teams had not reclaimed wasteland and had delayed transplanting.
    After a lot of commotion for most of the night, the sky was already bright. Xu Zhiying followed the water flow to Xiaoduzhuang to check the water. In the afternoon, she rushed more than fifty miles back to Zhouguantun.
    For two days and one night, the water of the South Grand Canal tirelessly passed through the seventy-mile-long main canal, three branch canals, dozens of ditch canals, and countless furrows, irrigating the low-lying land of dozens of villages south of the Niangniang River. Xu Zhiying also followed for two days and one night. She felt her legs getting heavier and heavier, her eyes were sore, and her head was sluggish. She washed her face with cold water, ate a few mouthfuls of food, and followed the water flow in the direction of the North Branch Canal.
    The water was gurgling, still singing a beautiful song all the way. Xu Zhiying felt a faint headache. She vigorously wiped her face and used an electric baton to illuminate the canal. The water was flowing slowly and weakly. She immediately stopped and asked the gatekeeper to go back and check.
    "Xiaoduzhuang, Houwangying, and Qianwangying have dug five openings in the canal, they are stealing water!" The gatekeeper reported back.
    Xu Zhiying smiled slightly after hearing this. It was really interesting. Not long ago, these villages were still fighting over drainage. Everyone was afraid of water and disliked water, trying every means to drive the water away and unwilling to keep the water in the village. Now, they all loved water and wanted water so much that they were secretly stealing water. She rushed back to Houwangying Village and brought the deputy township head of this township, Wang Depo, and the village heads and cooperative directors of the three water-stealing villages.
    "If you want water, don't other villages need water to reclaim wasteland? Water is allocated according to the land and labor of each village according to plan. If you take more water, you won't have enough manpower and won't be able to transplant seedlings. Won't that be a waste of water and fertilizer, and will it also affect the production of other villages?" Xu Zhiying patiently explained the truth to them. That night, all five openings were blocked.
    The water sang happily again, in the dark night, under the starlight, it flowed forward along the newly dug canal. Xu Zhiying was drowsy, walking with one foot high and one foot low, fighting against sleepiness. She forced herself to think about some difficult and tense things: the flood control in 1955, the rescue at each place, the phone ringing countless times in the night; the support for the opening of the canal in Tuanbaiwa, she led five thousand migrant workers, the knee-deep mud, the locust-like mosquitoes... But her eyelids were still heavy, heavily stuck together. Lao Liang, who was walking with her, fell far behind, and she sat on the edge of the canal waiting for him. As soon as she sat down, she saw a golden expanse before her eyes. The 100,000 mu of rice fields east of Qing County had a bumper harvest. Everywhere was singing and laughter; Liu Jingshan, an old man from Liuquetun, grabbed a handful of golden rice and showed it to her, smiling and saying, "County Head Xu, all thanks to changing the planting, the people of our Qing County have good days ahead!" The missing-toothed old woman from Lijiafen smiled so much that she couldn't close her mouth: "This old woman can also eat rice, and won't eat yellow alfalfa anymore." The girl from Zhaoxinzhuang who married out brought her son-in-law back to her mother's house: "Zhaoxinzhuang is the second Xiaozhan, we will settle down here." The dozen or so wealthy middle peasants who had withdrawn from the cooperative in Xiaoduzhuang were constantly requesting to return to the cooperative: "Going it alone is really embarrassing." What a wonderful scene! Suddenly, a torrential rain poured down, drenching down without warning, and the 100,000 mu of golden rice disappeared... Xu Zhiying only heard a thump, was startled, and opened her eyes, only to see that Lao Liang, who had fallen behind her, had fallen into the ditch. She quickly walked forward and helped him up. Lao Liang smiled embarrassedly and said, "I was drowsy and walked into the ditch!"
    Now, this was already the third day. The water flowed through Liushiyintun, Zengguantun, and straight to Chenquetun. The people of Chenquetun were waiting in the fields with hoes and rakes, only to see the water flowing with difficulty like a belt.
    Something was wrong again, Xu Zhiying immediately returned to Zengguantun to check. The ditch gate was closed properly. She asked the gatekeeper to rush to the main gate, where the water had not been released less.
    She pursed her lips tightly. She thought for a while and asked Lao Liang to take off his shoes and go into the water to take a look, only to find that the gate was made of two sections of wooden boards. The lower half of the wooden board was removed, and the water was secretly running straight to the fields of Zengguantun.
    The faces of the village cadres of Zengguantun were red, and they didn't dare to look at Xu Zhiying, and quickly blocked the gate.
    The water flowed gurglingly and quickly towards Chenquetun. Xu Zhiying followed closely behind, and went to see the watering with Zhang Guofu, the Party Committee Secretary of this township. They walked to the three-sided gate. This was the canal built by the women, and without inspection, they connected the water diversion canal and the drainage canal together. The water was running away along the drainage canal. Xu Zhiying shined with a flashlight, looked back at Zhang Guofu, flicked the flashlight, and pressed the gate panel with her hand. Zhang Guofu panicked for a while. Hadn't he said at the township secretary joint meeting that the canals in his township had all been inspected and were of excellent quality? Zhang Guofu, ah, Zhang Guofu, how are you going to explain to County Head Xu now? But it was too late to blush. He took a step forward and, together with cooperative director Lv Jinding, first blocked the gate with mud, and then greeted the cooperative members who ran over to separate the water diversion canal and the drainage canal. At this time, it was time to release water to Yizhuangzi, so they had to raise the gate. It was originally scheduled to water seventy mu of land that night, but twenty mu were watered less. Lv Jinding and Zhang Guofu quickly confessed to Xu Zhiying that they had not universally inspected the canals, wasted water, and affected the watering and wasteland reclamation.
    Now, the water finally flowed to the last place in the canal - Yizhuangzi. For three days and three nights, Xu Zhiying followed the water and traveled all over the seventy-mile-long main canal, traveled all over the other seventy-mile-long North Branch Canal, and reached the end of the canal. She finally figured out the information she needed about the water flowing through each township, each cooperative, and each canal, and found the key to managing water use. At this time, she suddenly realized that her legs were so sore that she couldn't move a step. With great difficulty, she walked into the gate of the Yizhuangzi Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and fell asleep on the kang.
    Outside, there was a lot of noise, and the busy labor day of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative began. This one loudly wanted to buy salt, that one loudly wanted to buy oil, arguing endlessly. The director of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative hissed and pointed to the room inside, saying: "Stop arguing, County Head Xu has been watching the water for three days and three nights without sleep, and has just fallen asleep inside." As soon as he finished speaking, the whole room immediately fell silent, and all transactions were carried out in soft voices. But the sound of flowing water in the canal outside the house seemed to be getting more and more cheerful. (Attached picture)

    三日三夜流水声
    ——一个女县长治水的故事
    本报记者　　金凤
    闸上的会议刚一结束，县委副书记张秀彬，副县长许志英、县委委员老马带着工程科的老梁和老归，马上分头出发，沿着南支渠，跟着水流走去。
    许志英和老梁一路。和往常一样，她性急地大步大步地走着，使老梁都有些跟她不上。她微微皱起眉头，抿紧嘴唇，满脸是那种下定决心要狠干一场的神气。本来嘛，好容易一个月内突击出一百多万土方工程，修好渠道，准备拉荒洗碱，偏偏水不听话，不好掌握。十万亩准备改种稻子的洼碱地兀自白着脸躺在那里。而千辛万苦培育出的绿油油的秧苗眼看要枯萎。一定要跟住水，寻出整个渠系的放水规律，让南运河的水服服贴贴地流到那等着拉荒洗碱的洼地里去，让河北的青县种起十万亩水稻！
    种十万亩水稻，这是青县由穷变富的途径！许志英脑中闪过刘缺屯六十三岁的刘敬山老汉那热烈的言词：“青县一年不改种，一年要受穷；十年不改种，十年要受穷；一辈子不改种，一辈子要受穷！”人民是多么迫切地要摆脱他们贫困的命运！她又记起一个月以前她下乡来时那么多双欢送的充满期望的眼睛：“等着吃你们的稻米！”但是，她也分明看见，那闪过去的几双怀疑的带着讥笑的眼光：“看你们搞出什么名堂！”她那时是发了誓的：“运河以东要种稻成功，就打开青县由穷变富的大门，1958年再去种稻。要种不成功没脸再上运东，只好到运西种旱田去！”现在眼看要拉荒插秧，而他们不会放水！
    许志英一路上紧跟着水，顺着支渠，顺着斗渠，顺着毛渠走到田里。她细心观察着水流和地势，记录下各渠所流经的时间。不知不觉她走到下伍村了。
    只听得村头节制闸上一片人声喧哗，几个人像在吵架。她走近前去，只见清和庄的副社长张明德脸胀得通红，冲着下伍村的支部书记杨秀林直嚷：“你给不给我提闸？”杨秀林微微冷笑：“你们花钱，你们提闸、你们不出钱，这闸的所有权属于我们！”“你们修闸，我们还挖了渠咧”，穿着一身旧军衣的张明德特别性急，嗓门又粗。他一眼看到许志英来了，连忙说：“许县长来了，快来评评谁是谁非。闸修在他们村上，就不给我们村放水！”许志英知道修渠时清和庄少给下伍村换地，修闸时又不肯出钱，下伍村气不过，才这样憋着不给清和庄放水。
    她就笑着给两家调解：“闸和渠还是两家用，过两天去修王家沟时，清和庄多出三十个人去，等于给下伍村换了工。两家不许再出怨言了。”
    从下伍走到清和庄，她仔细检查了所有的渠道，当天下午赶回周官屯总闸，和张秀彬他们核对了一下情况，当晚她又和秀彬一起赶到大杜庄去。
    他们走到村边，就看到春麦地里有水。许志英说：“水怎么跑到这里来了？”这时，他们又听到洼里老百姓也在乱嚷嚷：“水怎么来得那么冲？”“准是闸上水放大了！”他们只见洼地一片灯火，提灯来回的窜，活像一条条的火龙，老百姓明灯火仗，连夜在赶着拉荒浇地。
    许志英发觉水势大得不对头，奔到闸上一看，那苇闸果然被水冲断了。她忙和秀彬一起挺身堵住闸口，一面急急派人去叫社干部来，一面又派人到打虎庄把上面的闸关住。水势才一点点小下来。
    “亏得你们来了，要不，一洼全淹没了，还插什么秧，种什么稻哩？！”老百姓这时都埋怨起社干部没有一个在闸上看水。
    “你听听，那怕你就守在这里，别到处乱跑腿咧！”许志英批评着气喘吁吁跑来的副社长陈金清。水这么一淹，有一半生产队没有拉荒，反而耽误了插秧。
    闹腾了大半宿，天色已经大亮了。许志英跟着水流，到小杜庄看水。下午，她赶五十多里地回到周官屯。
    两天一夜，南运河的流水不疲倦地通过七十里长的干渠，三条支渠，几十条斗渠和无数毛渠，浇了娘娘河以南几十个村庄的洼地。许志英也跟着走了两天一夜。她感到腿愈来愈重，眼睛发涩，脑袋滞重。她用凉水洗一洗脸，吃几口饭，又跟着流水，向北支渠的方向走去。
    流水淙淙，还是一路唱着好听的歌曲。许志英隐隐头疼，她用劲抹了抹脸，用电棒照了照渠道，水流得缓慢，细弱了。她马上停住脚步，叫看闸员回去查看。
    “小杜庄、后王营和前王营在渠道上扒开五道口，他们偷水了！”看闸员回来报告说。
    许志英听了微微一笑。真有意思，不久以前，这些村还为了排水打架咧，谁都怕水、厌水，想尽办法把水赶走，不愿要水留在村里。如今，又都这样爱水、想水，还悄悄地偷起水来了。她赶回后王营村，把这个乡的副乡长王德坡和偷水的三个村的村长、社长都找来。
    “你们要水，别的村难道不要水拉荒吗？水是有计划按各村的土地、劳力分配的。你们多要了水，人手不够，插不上秧，还不是白白浪费水和肥料，还影响别的村的生产。”许志英耐心地和他们讲清道理。当晚，五个口都堵上了。
    流水又愉快地唱起歌曲来了，在黑夜里，在星光下，它顺着新挖的渠道向前奔流着。许志英迷迷糊糊，一脚高一脚低地走着，和瞌睡作着斗争。她强迫自己想些艰苦紧张的事：那1955年的防汛，那一处处的抢险，那一夜数惊的电话；那支援团拜洼的开渠，她带五千民工，那没膝的泥浆，那蚂蚱似的蚊虫……但是，眼皮还是沉沉地，沉沉地粘在一起。和她一起走的老梁落在她后面好远了，她坐在渠边等着他。她刚一坐下，只见眼前一片金黄，青县运东的十万亩稻田丰收了。到处是歌声和笑声；刘缺屯的刘敬山老汉抓起一把黄澄澄的稻谷给她看，笑着说：“许县长，全亏了改种，咱青县老百姓有好日子过了！”那李家坟缺嘴的老婆婆笑得阖不拢嘴：“俺老婆子也吃上稻米饭，再不吃黄蓿菜了”。那赵辛庄嫁出去的姑娘带着女婿回娘家住：“赵辛庄是第二个小站，俺们就在这安家了。”小杜庄那十几户退社的富裕中农在不断地请求着回社：“单干单干，实在难看”。多么美妙的光景！忽然，一场瓢泼似的大雨，没头没脑浇下来，那十万亩金黄的稻子不见了……许志英只听得扑通一声，吃了一惊，睁开眼睛，只见落在她后面的老梁摔到沟里去了。她连忙走上前把他拉起来。老梁不好意思地笑着说：“迷迷糊糊，走到沟里去了！”
    现在，这已经是第三个白天了。水流经过刘世印屯、曾官屯直往陈缺屯流去。这里快到北支渠的终点。陈缺屯的老百姓拿着锄耙在地里等着，只见水像一条带子似地艰难地流着。
    又出了毛病了，许志英立即返回曾官屯检查。只见斗门闸闭得好好的。她让看闸员赶到总闸，那里水也没有放少。
    她抿紧了嘴唇。她想了一回，让老梁脱掉鞋下水去看看，才发现那个闸是二截木板做的。下半截木板抽掉了，水偷偷地直往曾官屯的地里跑去。
    曾官屯的村干部的脸都红了，他们的眼睛都不敢看许志英，赶紧堵上闸门。
    流水淙淙，轻快地直奔陈缺屯。许志英在后面紧跟着，和这个乡的党委书记张国富一起去看浇地。他们走到三面闸的地方。这儿是妇女们修的渠道，没有检查，她们把引水渠和排水渠连在一起。水正顺着排水渠跑走。许志英用手电棒一照，回头看了张国富一眼，把电棒一撩，就用手按住闸板。张国富一阵心慌，在乡书联席会上他不是说过本乡的渠道统统经过检查、质量优良的吗？张国富啊张国富，你现在怎么向许县长交代咧？但是脸红也来不及了，他抢上一步和社主任吕金定一起先用泥堵住闸口，又招呼跑来的社员把引水渠和排水渠分开，这时候，给伊庄子放水的时间到了，他们只好把闸提起。原定这夜浇七十亩地，少浇了二十亩。吕金定和张国富赶紧向许志英检讨他们没有普遍检查渠道，浪费了水，影响了浇地拉荒。
    现在，水流总算奔流到渠道最末一个地方——伊庄子了。三天三夜，许志英随着流水走遍了七十里的大干渠，走遍了另一条七十多里的北支渠，到了渠道的终点。她总算弄清楚了她需要的水流经各乡、各社、各渠的资料，找到了管理用水的钥匙。这时，她突然发觉自己的腿酸软得一步也挪不动。好容易走进伊庄子供销社的大门，她一头倒在炕上就睡熟了。
    外面人声喧哗，供销社热闹的劳动日开始了。这个大声要买盐，那个大声要买油，吵吵嚷嚷不可开交。供销社主任嘘了一声，用手朝里间屋指一下说：“快别吵了，许县长看水走了三天三夜没睡觉，才在里面睡着咧。”他的话刚一落音，满屋立即静悄悄地，一桩桩交易都在轻言细语中进行着。那屋外渠道中的流水声却仿佛愈来愈欢畅了。（附图片）
