One ton of fresh eggs can extract 500 kilograms of protein liquid. These protein liquids can be made into 70 kilograms of egg flakes or 485 kilograms of frozen eggs. There are also 380 kilograms of egg yolk liquid, which can be made into 171 kilograms of egg yolk powder or 375 kilograms of salted egg yolks. These things are indispensable raw materials for making biscuits, cream pastries, and cool drinks. Protein also has many uses in the textile industry, leather making, and the pharmaceutical industry. If the protein and egg yolk powder processed from one ton of fresh eggs are exported, they can be exchanged for 163 pounds.

The remaining eggshells, after being dried and baked, can be made into eggshell powder, which is also a good feed and fertilizer. Every 10,000 catties of eggshells can also be baked to yield 75.7 catties of secondary protein, which is also a valuable raw material in industry. (Attached chart)

    蛋
    一吨鲜蛋，可以提取蛋白液五百公斤，这些蛋白液可制成七十公斤蛋片或四百八十五公斤冰蛋。还有三百八十公斤蛋黄液，可制成一百七十一公斤蛋黄粉或盐黄三百七十五公斤，这些东西都是做饼干、奶油点心、清凉饮料不可缺少的原料，蛋白在纺织工业、制革和医药工业上也有很多用途。一吨鲜蛋加工出的蛋白和蛋黄粉，如果出口，可以换回一百六十三英镑。
    剩下的蛋壳，烤干后能做成蛋壳粉，这又是很好的饲料和肥料。每万斤蛋壳中还可以烤出七十五点七斤次蛋白，也是工业上的宝贵原料。（附图表）
