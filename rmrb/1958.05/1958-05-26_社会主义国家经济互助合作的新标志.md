　　The representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) held a meeting in Moscow from May 20 to 23. The meeting, in an atmosphere of sincerity, friendship, and brotherly mutual assistance and understanding, discussed the issue of further developing economic cooperation among socialist countries based on the implementation of socialist international division of labor and the rational arrangement of production specialization and collaboration, and adopted unanimously agreed recommendations on this issue. In addition to the representatives of the parties of the eight member countries of the CMEA, the representatives of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Chinese Communist Party, the Korean Workers' Party, and the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party were also invited to attend the meeting. The representatives of the non-member parties also unanimously expressed their active participation in economic cooperation among socialist countries, and, according to the specific circumstances of each country, adopted appropriate methods and steps to strengthen cooperation in this area. This meeting fully embodied the spirit of the declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries and made a significant contribution to further strengthening the friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries.
　　The CMEA is a comprehensive economic cooperation organization established by the Soviet Union and European socialist countries based on the principle of proletarian internationalism and on the principles of complete equality, mutual respect for national interests, and socialist mutual assistance. For nearly ten years, the CMEA member countries, through the coordination of national economic plans, equal and mutually beneficial trade, preferential long-term loans, various enterprise equipment, and technical assistance provided by economically advanced countries to other fraternal countries, the exchange of technical data, the exchange of experts to introduce scientific technology and production experience, the joint research of technical problems by experts from various countries, and the provision of free economic assistance, have developed fraternal economic cooperation in a variety of ways. Especially between 1955 and 1957, the CMEA member countries, under the premise of guaranteeing the interests of socialist countries and the common interests of the entire socialist camp, carried out tremendous work in mutually coordinating the annual and long-term plans for the development of the national economy, and made considerable efforts in the specialization and collaboration of the main sectors of the socialist countries' economies. This has brought the economic cooperation of socialist countries into a new stage. The CMEA's work over nearly ten years has profoundly demonstrated the great significance of mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries. As the communique of the meeting pointed out: "This cooperation effectively serves the cause of socialist and communist construction and can fully exert the superiority of the world socialist economic system to develop the productive forces of each socialist country and enhance the economic strength of the entire socialist camp."
　　The fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries has enabled some countries to change their original backward economic conditions or to rise to the level of advanced countries. In this regard, the Soviet Union's multifaceted and selfless assistance to other socialist brother countries has played the most significant role. The Soviet Union, the most powerful and experienced socialist country, has always regarded assisting fraternal countries in socialist construction as a glorious internationalist obligation. Comrade Khrushchev once said: "The essence and characteristics of friendship among socialist countries lie in their mutual assistance. If a socialist country achieves great success, it considers it its brotherly responsibility to help the development of other socialist countries." In 1956 alone, the Soviet Union supplied other socialist countries with complete sets of enterprise equipment with a total value of approximately 1.2 billion rubles, an increase of more than eleven times compared to 1950. With the assistance of the Soviet Union, nearly five hundred enterprises have been built and are under construction in socialist countries. The Soviet Union's brotherly and selfless assistance to other socialist countries has played a leading role in the CMEA, and this assistance has promoted the common upsurge of the economies of the CMEA member countries.
　　After discussing the work of the CMEA, this meeting pointed out a new direction for future economic cooperation among socialist countries. The meeting believed that, at present, with the economic ties among socialist countries having been greatly strengthened and possessing a comprehensive nature, it is of particular significance to continue to develop economic cooperation among them, to improve the forms of this cooperation, and to further implement the specialization and collaboration of production in the interconnected sectors of the national economies of the socialist camp countries. The meeting also pointed out that it is necessary to further enhance the role of the CMEA's various institutions in organizing economic cooperation. The significant achievements made at this meeting will undoubtedly further strengthen the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries and bring a profound impact on the economies of each socialist country and the economy of the entire socialist camp.
　　The two distinctly different economic landscapes in the world are now even clearer: the flourishing economy of socialist countries and the increasingly profound economic crisis of capitalist countries have formed a very sharp contrast. The Moscow meeting of the CMEA not only showed that the economy of the socialist camp has undergone tremendous development in fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation, but also showed that the economy of the socialist camp will achieve faster and greater development in further strengthening economic cooperation among socialist countries in the future. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries pointed out: "In our era, the development of the world depends on the process and outcome of the competition between the two opposing social systems." The results of the Moscow meeting of the CMEA once again convinced us that socialism will inevitably defeat capitalism in peaceful competition.
　　Our people have always believed that continuously strengthening the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union is our highest international obligation, and have always strived to develop mutual assistance and cooperation with various socialist brother countries. This time, the representatives of our party and the parties of Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia were invited to participate in the meeting, and unanimously expressed their active participation and adoption of concrete steps to strengthen economic cooperation among socialist countries, once again demonstrating the unbreakable sincere desire for friendly unity and mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries. We warmly congratulate the significant achievements made at the Moscow meeting of the CMEA. We are deeply convinced that the further strengthening of economic cooperation among socialist countries will inevitably enhance the strength of our socialist construction and the economic strength of the entire socialist camp.

### 社会主义国家经济互助合作的新标志

    社会主义国家经济互助合作的新标志
    5月20日到23日，在莫斯科举行了经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议。会议在诚恳、友好和兄弟般互助谅解的气氛下，讨论了社会主义各国在贯彻社会主义国际分工以及合理安排生产专业化和协作的基础上进一步发展经济合作的问题，并就这一问题通过了一致同意的建议。参加会议的除了经济互助委员会的八个成员国党的代表外，越南劳动党、中国共产党、朝鲜劳动党和蒙古人民革命党的代表也应邀参加了会议。非会员国党的代表，在会议上也一致表示积极参加社会主义各国间的经济合作，并根据各国的具体情况，采取适当的方式和步骤来加强这方面的合作。这次会议充分体现了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言的精神，对进一步加强社会主义国家间的友好团结和互助合作作出了重大的贡献。
    经济互助委员会是苏联和欧洲社会主义国家本着无产阶级国际主义的原则，并以完全平等、互相尊重民族利益和社会主义互助的原则为基础而建立的全面经济合作的组织。将近十年以来，经济互助委员会各成员国，通过国民经济计划的配合，平等互利的贸易，经济较先进国家向其他兄弟国家提供优惠的长期贷款、各种企业设备和技术援助，互换技术资料，互换专家以介绍科学技术和生产经验，各国专家共同研究技术问题和无偿地给予经济援助等多种多样的方式，发展了兄弟般的经济合作。特别是在1955年到1957年间，经济互助委员会各成员国，在保证社会主义各国的利益和整个社会主义阵营的共同利益的前提下，在互相配合发展国民经济的年度计划和远景计划方面进行了巨大的工作，在社会主义国家经济主要部门的专业化和协作方面也作了不少的努力，这使社会主义国家的经济合作进入了新的阶段。经济互助委员会将近十年的工作，深刻地表明了社会主义国家间的互助合作的巨大意义。正如会议公报所指出的：“这种合作有成效地为社会主义和共产主义建设事业服务，并且能够充分地发挥世界社会主义经济体系的优越性，来发展每个社会主义国家的生产力和增强整个社会主义阵营的经济力量。”
    社会主义国家之间的兄弟般的互助合作，已使一些国家改变了原来的经济落后的面貌，或者提高到先进国家的水平。在这方面，苏联对于其他社会主义兄弟国家的多方面的无私援助，起了最显著的作用。力量最强大和经验最丰富的社会主义国家苏联，一向把援助兄弟国家进行社会主义建设看成是光荣的国际主义义务。赫鲁晓夫同志曾经说过：“社会主义国家友谊的实质和特点也就在于它们相互援助。如果一个社会主义国家获得了巨大的成就，那末，它认为帮助其他社会主义国家的发展就是自己兄弟般的责任。”苏联1956年一年中，供给其他社会主义国家的整套企业设备，总值就约达十二亿卢布，比1950年增加了十一倍以上。社会主义各国在苏联的援助下，目前已经建成和正在兴建的企业差不多有五百个。苏联对其他社会主义国家的兄弟般的无私援助，在经济互助委员会中起了主导的作用，这种援助促进了经济互助委员会各成员国经济的共同高涨。
    这次会议在讨论了经济互助委员会的工作之后，为今后社会主义国家间的经济合作指出了新的方向。会议认为，目前在社会主义各国之间的经济联系已经大大加强、并且具有全面性质的情况下，继续发展它们之间的经济合作和改善这种合作的形式，进一步实行社会主义阵营各国国民经济相互联系部门的生产专业化和协作，具有特别的意义。会议并且指出，必须进一步提高经济互助委员会的各个机构在组织经济合作方面的作用。这次会议所取得的重大成果，无疑地，将进一步加强社会主义国家兄弟般的互助合作，为每个社会主义国家的经济和整个社会主义阵营的经济带来深刻的影响。
    世界上存在着两种截然不同的经济景象，现在是看得更为清楚了：社会主义国家经济的欣欣向荣，资本主义国家经济危机的日益深刻化，已经形成了一个十分鲜明的对比。这次经济互助委员会莫斯科会议，不仅表明了社会主义阵营的经济在兄弟般的互助合作中已经有了巨大的发展，而且表明了今后在进一步加强社会主义国家经济合作中，社会主义阵营的经济还要获得更快更大的发展。社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言指出：“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果。”经济互助委员会莫斯科会议的结果，再一次使我们深信，在和平竞赛中社会主义必然战胜资本主义。
    我国人民一向认为不断加强以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结是我们最高的国际义务，并且一向努力发展同各个社会主义兄弟国家间的互助合作。这次我们党的代表和越南、朝鲜、蒙古党的代表应邀参加会议，在会议上一致表示积极参加和采取具体步骤加强社会主义国家之间的经济合作，再一次表明了社会主义国家友好团结和互助合作的真诚愿望是牢不可破的。我们热烈祝贺经济互助委员会莫斯科会议所取得的重大成就。我们深信，社会主义国家间的经济合作的进一步加强，必然会增强我国社会主义建设的力量和整个社会主义阵营的经济力量。
