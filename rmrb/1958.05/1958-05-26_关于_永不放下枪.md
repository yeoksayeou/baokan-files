    On "Never Put Down the Gun"
    Guo Xiaochuan
    On the evening of May 7th, I went to visit a general's house. As soon as we met, the general told me, "There's a good poem published in the People's Daily today." I took the newspaper and read it twice, and I thought it was indeed good.
    The title of this poem is "Never Put Down the Gun," and it was written by Second Lieutenant Xu Xiangguo of the People's Liberation Army. It is understood that before Comrade Xu Xiangguo was transferred from Henan to a state-owned farm in the Mishan area of Heilongjiang Province, he read Guo Lao's poem "War Against the Earth" and specifically wrote this poem in response to Guo Lao's "praise," and to express his determination. The poem begins with considerable spirit:
    A red heart is given to the Party
    The hero doffs his uniform and returns to the battlefield
    Not like boarding a warship in those years
    Not like crossing the Yangtze River with a spear in those years
    Sons and daughters leave the team to go north
    Responding to the call to march on the Great Northern Wilderness
    From here, we can clearly hear the heroic and bold footsteps. Having "given a red heart to the Party," although today is not going to fight the enemy, it is also "returning to the battlefield," which is another "battlefield" of "war against the earth."
    The following four paragraphs enter the climax of the poem, stirring up emotional waves:
    Using the hand that holds the gun to pick up the hoe
    Forcing the land to yield food
    Let the blood-stained military uniform
    Be rewarded with machine oil and mud
    Let the scars pierced by bullets
    Glow red on the black earth
    A red heart is given to the Party
    The hero doffs his uniform and never puts down the gun
    These lines of poetry really moved the general. He said, "These words are very touching and also express the feelings of old soldiers like me..." Yes, "using the hand that holds the gun" "forcing the land to yield food," what momentum! What power! (How well the words "forcing" and "yield" are used!) It conforms to the revolutionary style that a soldier should have. The artistic conception of the last four lines is even higher, not only moving old soldiers who have had personal experience, but even a soldier like me who has not been injured, who is neither old nor young, is emotionally stirred.
    The general said, "A composer should be invited to set it to music." So, we recited it over and over again. We found that although the poem as a whole is good, there are indeed some inappropriate uses of words, such as "blood-stained" military uniform, "blood-stained" already has the meaning of "soaked," saying "soaked" again seems redundant. "Scars pierced by bullets" is also inaccurate. Does the so-called "scar" here mean that the wound pierced by the bullet has formed a scar, or is the "scar" "pierced by a bullet" again? The original meaning is not clear on this point. We also thought that if we changed these two sentences, and didn't say "blood-stained" and "scars," wouldn't it be more in line with the actual situation of the officers and soldiers participating in production and construction in the Great Northern Wilderness? We immediately drafted a modification plan and planned to ask the original author to consider it.
    We spent several hours on this poem, but we had a very pleasant evening. Now that I think about it, what made us feel happy at the time was not so much the poem itself, but these people. Only people with this kind of revolutionary style can write poems that reflect such people. The author is not a well-known poet, but the power of life has enabled him to write poems that even poets may not be able to write. I think that if thousands upon thousands of people who are riding the waves of life come to write poetry, then great geniuses will surely emerge.
    As the general was leaving, he instructed me to write a short article commenting on this poem. I don't have the ability to erect the framework of a commentary article, so I have to record the course of events as above.

    关于“永不放下枪”
    郭小川
    5月7日的晚上，我到一位将军的家里去作客。一见面，将军就告诉我：“今天人民日报上登了一首好诗。”我拿过报纸看了两遍，觉得确实不错。
    这首诗的题目叫“永不放下枪”，是解放军少尉徐先国同志写的。据了解，这位徐先国同志在从河南调往黑龙江省密山地区国营农场的前夕，看了郭老的“向地球开战”一诗以后，特地写了这首诗回答郭老的“称赞”，并且表白自己的决心。诗一开头，就颇有气魄：
    一颗红心交给党
    英雄解甲重上战场
    不是当年整装上舰艇
    不是当年横戈渡长江
    儿女离队要北上
    响应号令远征北大荒
    从这里，我们可以清晰地听到英雄的豪迈的脚步声。“一颗红心交给党”了，今天虽不是跟敌人作战去，却也是“重上战场”，这是“向地球开战”的另一种“战场”。
    下面四段，进入了全诗高潮，掀起了情感的波澜：
    用拿枪的手把起锄头
    强迫土地交出食粮
    让血迹浸染的军装
    受到机油和泥土的奖赏
    让子弹穿透的疤伤
    在黑土地上泛红发光
    一颗红心交给党
    英雄解甲永不放下枪
    这几句诗，真地把将军感动了。他说：“这些话，很动人，也道出了像我这样的老战士的心声。……”是呵，“用拿枪的手”“强迫土地交出食粮”，多有气势！多有力量！（“强迫”和“交出”四个字用得多好！）合乎一个战士应有的革命风格。后四行的意境更高，不但使有过亲身体验的老战士动心，就连我这没有负过伤的、不老不少的战士，感情上也很激奋。
    将军说：“应当请一位作曲家，给它谱成歌曲。”于是，我们一遍一遍地吟诵起来。我们发现，这首诗虽然整个说来是不错的，但也确有些用词不当的地方，如“血迹浸染”军装，“血迹”已经有“浸染”的意思，再说“浸染”就显得累赘了。“子弹穿透的疤伤”，也不确切，这里的所谓“疤伤”，是子弹穿过的伤口结了疤呢，还是“疤伤”又被“子弹穿透”呢？原意在这一点上是不清楚的。我们又想到，如果把这两句改一改，不说“血迹”和“疤伤”，不是更合乎在北大荒参加生产建设的官兵的实际情况吗？我们当即拟出了一个修改的方案，打算请原作者考虑。
    为了这首诗，我们用了几小时的时间，但我们过了一个很愉快的晚上。现在想来，当时使我们感到愉快的，首先还不是这首诗，而是这些人。只有具有这种革命风格的人，才能写出反映这样的人的诗来。作者并不是知名的诗人，然而生活的力量却使他写出诗人都未必写得出的诗来。我想，如果千千万万的、在生活上乘风破浪前进的人们都来写诗，那一定会涌现出伟大的天才来的。
    将军在临走时嘱我写篇短文评论一下这首诗，我没有能力支起评论文章的架子，只好将经过情形纪录如上。
