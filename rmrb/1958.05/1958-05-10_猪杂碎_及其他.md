    "Pig Offal" and Others
    The endocrine glands of livestock are a major raw material for pharmaceuticals and also a raw material for industrial use, and are of great value. The Shanghai Frozen Meat Factory began trial-producing various endocrine gland products in the second half of 1955. To date, it has trial-produced more than thirty kinds, including pig and bovine pituitary glands, pig thyroid glands, pig pancreas, pig spleens, pig gastric mucosa, pig spinal cords, cholesterol, bilirubin, beef tallow oil, pepsin, insulin, sodium cholate... and so on. These products are important raw materials for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and industrial production. In the past, most of them relied on imports from foreign countries. Now, many have been officially produced, and some have been further processed into preliminary raw materials or finished products for industry or medicine.
    Due to the full utilization of by-products, the factory's income has increased. Last year alone, the value of pig pituitary gland production exceeded 100,000 yuan. If all the various endocrine gland products that the factory has successfully trial-produced are put into production, the annual income can be increased by more than 1 million yuan; if these products are further processed into pharmaceuticals, the value will be even greater. The Biochemical Research Office of the Shanghai Institute of Pharmaceutical Industry has recently successfully trial-produced ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone injection) using pig pituitary glands. If domestic production replaces imports in the future, 1 million yuan in foreign exchange can be saved each year. (Lin Shouquan)

    “猪杂碎”及其他
    牲畜的内分泌腺是医药制品的一种主要原料，也是工业上用的原料，价值很大。上海冻肉厂从1955年下半年开始试制各种内分泌腺产品，到目前为止，已试制了三十多种，包括猪、牛脑下垂腺、猪甲状腺、猪胰脏、猪脾脏、猪胃粘膜、猪脊髓、胆固醇、胆色素、牛脚趾油、胃蛋白酶、胰岛素、胆酸钠……等等；这些产品，都是制造医药和工业生产上的重要原料，过去大部分依靠国外进口，现在不少已正式生产，有的已进一步制成工业或药物的初步原料或制成品。
    由于充分利用了副产品，增加了工厂的收入，去年就生产猪脑下垂腺价值十万元以上。如这个厂已试制成功的各种内分泌腺产品全投入生产，每年可增加收入一百万元以上；这些产品如进一步制成药制品，价值更大。上海医药工业研究所生化研究室最近利用猪脑下埀腺试制ACTH（促进肾上腺皮质激素注射液）成功，今后如国内自行生产代替进口货，每年可节省外汇一百万元。　（林寿全）
