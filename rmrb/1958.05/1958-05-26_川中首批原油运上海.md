Currently, three more wells are being vigorously tested and will be able to be put into production soon. It is estimated that around 100,000 tons of crude oil will be supplied to industrial departments for refining this year.

    川中首批原油运上海
    据新华社成都24日电　川中油区第一批原油22日从南充、武胜两地装上拖轮，顺着嘉陵江运往重庆转运上海炼制。
    这批原油是从龙女寺二号井和南充三号井开采的，目前还有三口井正在加紧试油，不久就可以开采。预计今年供给工业部门炼制的原油将在十万吨左右。
    在南充修建的小型炼油厂已进入设备安装阶段，另一座年产三十万吨的炼油厂正在勘测设计，这些工厂建成以后，一部分原油就可以就地炼制。
