　　The Enlarged Meeting of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPC Discusses the Socialist Construction Line and Other Issues

　　This newspaper reports that the Eighth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the CPC was held in Jinan from April 16th to 24th. After listening to the First Secretary of the Provincial Committee, Shu Tong, convey some important instructions from the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the meeting focused on discussing issues such as the socialist construction line, style, and methodology. Based on this spirit, the meeting analyzed the current situation in Shandong and made serious arrangements for future work in rectification and industrial and agricultural production.

　　In discussing the instructions from the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, everyone received profound education and great encouragement, clarifying many confused thoughts and vague viewpoints. The meeting believed that before studying, there were several different situations regarding the "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results" socialist construction line. The first type of person, although not realizing that achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results was the socialist construction line, resolutely implemented this line in practice. These comrades welcomed the situation of the great leap in production. They have always been working hard, vigorously, and practically. They grew up among the masses, are familiar with the demands and hopes of the masses, and are full of confidence in changing the backward economic situation. The second type of person was not conscious enough during the Great Leap Forward. Their confidence was greater when things went smoothly, but they wavered and became discouraged when faced with difficulties. Although their targets were repeatedly raised under the impact of the wave, many targets were not shared with the masses, and a few people themselves lacked confidence in the planned targets. The third type of person had more serious right-leaning conservative thinking and was a drag on production and construction. These people did not happily and enthusiastically respond to the Party's call for a great leap in production, but were rather cold and passively observing. In their leadership ideology, they did not come from the masses and go to the masses, but instead allowed experts and technicians to lead them by the nose.

　　The meeting believed that to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, it is necessary to first liberate the mind, and develop the spirit of independent thinking and bold creation. It is essential to overcome the dependence and blindness that exist in some cadres; do not always seek ready-made solutions or copy methods; do not always parrot others and follow the trend; it is necessary to promote a courageous, firm, energetic, bold, imaginative, and creative communist style. The prerequisite for achieving this is to learn dialectics, respect materialism, and oppose both dogmatism and empiricism. The meeting required all cadres to earnestly strengthen investigation and research work, learn to think more, look more, talk more (converse), speak more (give reports), read more (read some theoretical works when unclear about problems), and write more (write articles, summarize experiences)—this creative leadership method and style from practice to theory.

　　The meeting believed that after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, the province's political and ideological outlook has been completely renewed, the Party's leadership authority has been further enhanced, and the work style of cadres has undergone significant changes. The meeting also pointed out that the main shortcomings of Shandong's Party organizations in the previous stage of rectification were that the rectification and reform in some areas were not thorough enough and the progress was relatively slow. In particular, the main problems of leading cadres in some units, such as localism, sectarianism, and right-leaning conservative thinking, were not thoroughly exposed and criticized, and key issues such as the principles and policies in the work were not resolved well or not resolved at all. Organizationally, some first secretaries did not seriously grasp the rectification, and some units' leading groups were in a state of no one being responsible. In order to carry out the rectification to the end, the first secretary must grasp both rectification and production with both hands. The meeting believed that the general situation is that the enthusiasm is high, the plans are proactive, there are many creations, the achievements are great, and the situation is good. In agriculture, as of early April, the province had expanded irrigated area by 31.6 million mu, transformed 16.83 million mu of waterlogged and low-lying land, controlled soil and water conservation area of 6,434 square kilometers, and deep-plowed and loosened the soil of 24.06 million mu. The total earthwork exceeded 3 billion cubic meters, equivalent to more than 30% of the second five-year plan and ten times that before liberation. To strive for a bumper harvest in agriculture for the whole year, it is also necessary to overcome six challenges: first, the wheat challenge, it is necessary to ensure that wheat is adequately fertilized, watered, and has full grains, prevent pests and diseases, and prevent wind disasters and lodging, and harvest carefully and meticulously; second, the planting challenge, it is necessary to do a good job of spring, summer, and autumn planting in a timely manner to ensure that the seedlings are complete and strong; third, the water and drought disaster challenge, it is necessary to actively overcome water and drought disasters; fourth, the technology challenge, it is necessary to reform the cultivation system, select good varieties, improve management and operating techniques, and innovate agricultural tools; fifth, the pest challenge, it is necessary to eliminate pests like eliminating the four pests; sixth, the crop safety challenge, it is necessary to harvest carefully and meticulously in a timely manner to ensure that the grains return home. The leadership of the county Party committees over agriculture should promote the method of formulating small-segment plans according to the lunar seasons in Shouzhang and Huang counties, so as to achieve consistency between the top and bottom and be clear in mind; in the situation where the masses are very enthusiastic, attention should be paid to regulating the rhythm of production, so that the broad masses can have a short rest after a period of concentrated effort, and then invest in the next battle with more full energy, so that the movement becomes a wave-like forward progression. In terms of industry, a production upsurge has also emerged throughout the province, with relatively active targets in various places, a significant increase in the amount of investment, and the problem of funding for the development of local industry has been largely resolved, and a large number of technological innovations have emerged. Under this new situation, it is entirely possible to ensure that the province's total industrial output value this year will increase by 50% compared with last year, and strive to exceed it; it is also very promising to make the total industrial output value catch up with or exceed agriculture within five or six years. In terms of production leadership, the meeting believed that it is necessary to focus on six aspects, namely, grasping enthusiasm, grasping measures (active, specific, practical), grasping technology, grasping methods (leadership methods, working methods), grasping quality, and grasping key points, and list them as important contents of the regular inspection, evaluation (which can be called six grasps, six checks, and six comparisons) movement.

　　The meeting finally required the entire Party in Shandong to thoroughly liberate their minds on the basis of the original victory, and lead the people of the province to carry out cultural and technological revolutions with a more meticulous, in-depth, and pragmatic style, and strive for a bumper harvest in both thought and production.

　　朝气蓬勃　独立思考　大胆创造
　　中共山东省委扩大会议讨论社会主义建设路线等问题
    本报讯　中共山东省委第八次全体（扩大）会议，4月16日到24日在济南举行。会议在听取省委第一书记舒同传达中央和毛主席最近一些重要的指示后，着重讨论了社会主义建设的路线、风格、思想方法等问题。并据此精神，分析了山东当前的形势，对今后整风和工农业生产等方面的工作，作了认真的安排。
    在讨论中央和毛主席指示中，大家得到深刻的教育和巨大的鼓舞，澄清了许多混乱思想和模糊观点。会议认为，在未学习前，对“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省”这一社会主义建设的路线，是存在几种不同情况的。第一种人，虽没有意识到多快好省是社会主义的建设路线，但在实践中却坚决地贯彻了这条路线，这些同志对生产大跃进的形势是欢迎的，他们一直是苦干、猛干、实干，他们生长在群众之中，熟悉群众的要求和希望，对改变落后的经济面貌，充满着信心。第二种人，是在大跃进的形势下不够自觉，顺利时信心大些，遇到困难时，就动摇泄气，虽然他们的指标在浪潮冲击下也一再提高，但好多指标没有与群众见面，少数人自己对计划指标也缺乏信心。第三种人，有比较严重的右倾保守思想，是生产建设中的促退派。这些人对党提出的生产大跃进的号召，不是高高兴兴，欢欣鼓舞，而是冷冷清清，消极观望，他们在领导思想上，不是从群众中来，到群众中去，而是听凭专家技术人员牵着鼻子走。
    会议认为，要多快好省的建设社会主义，必须首先要在思想上来个大解放，发扬独立思考与大胆创造精神。克服部分干部中存在着的依赖性、盲目性，不要总是图现成，套办法；不要老是人云亦云，随风转舵；要提倡勇敢坚定、朝气蓬勃、大胆设想、大胆创造的共产主义风格。做到这一点的前提，就是要学会辩证法，尊重唯物论，既要反对教条主义，又要反对经验主义。会议要求全体干部认真加强调查研究工作，学会多想、多看、多谈（交谈）、多讲（做报告）、多读（在对问题不清楚时，看一些理论著作）和多写（写文章，总结经验）这一从实际到理论的创造性的领导方法和风格。
    会议认为，经过整风、反右派斗争以后，全省政治、思想面貌焕然一新，党的领导威信更加提高，干部作风有显著转变。会议也同时指出，山东党组织前一段整风的主要缺点是某些地区整改不够深透，进度比较迟缓，特别是有些单位的领导干部中的主要问题，如地方主义、宗派主义、右倾保守思想等没有彻底揭发批判，工作中的方针、原则等关键性问题，解决得不好或没有解决。在组织上，有的第一书记没有认真地抓整风，有一些单位领导小组处于无人负责状态。为把整风进行到底，第一书记必须一手抓整风，一手抓生产。会议认为，总的形势是，干劲很足，计划积极，创造很多，成绩很大，形势很好。农业方面，到4月上旬止，全省已扩大灌溉面积三千一百六十万亩，改造涝洼一千六百八十三万亩，控制水土保持面积六千四百三十四平方公里，深翻深刨土地二千四百零六万亩，总土方超过三十多亿公方，相当于第二个五年计划的30％多，等于解放前的十倍。为争取全年农业大丰收，还必须过六关：一是小麦关，当前要使小麦肥足、水饱、籽粒饱满，防治病虫害，防止风灾、倒伏，精收细打；二是播种关，要适时做好春、夏、秋播，保证苗全苗旺；三是水旱灾害关，要积极战胜水旱灾害；四是技术关，要改革耕作制度，选良种，改善管理和操作技术，革新农具；五是虫害关，要像除四害一样，消灭虫害；六是作物安全关，要及时精收细打，保证颗粒还家。各县委对农业的领导，要推广寿张、黄县按农历季节制定小段计划的方法，做到上下一致，心中有数；在群众干劲很足的情况下，要注意调节生产节奏，使广大群众在突击一个时期之后，能有短时间休整，再以更饱满的精力投入下一次战斗，使运动成为波浪式的前进。工业方面，全省也出现了生产高潮，各地指标都比较积极，投资数目大大增加，地方工业发展资金已大体解决，技术革新大量出现。在这一新形势下，保证全省今年工业产值比去年增长50％，并争取超过，完全有可能；在五、六年内，使工业总产值赶上或超过农业，也大有希望。在生产领导上，会议认为，要着重抓六个方面，即抓干劲、抓措施（积极、具体、实际）、抓技术、抓方法（领导方法、工作方法）、抓质量、抓关键，并把它列为经常地检查、评比（可以叫做六抓、六查、六比）运动的重要内容。
    会议最后要求山东全党，在原有胜利的基础上，彻底解放思想，以更细致、更深入、更踏实的作风，带领全省人民进行文化革命和技术革命，争取思想上和生产上两大丰收。
