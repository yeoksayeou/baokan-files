Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 15th dispatch: Over 400,000 Japanese students held rallies and demonstrations simultaneously in 59 cities across the country today. They protested against the United States and Britain conducting nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Atoll and Christmas Island respectively, and also protested against the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of the reactionary "performance rating" system and its adoption of a hostile attitude towards China.

　　In Tokyo, approximately 10,000 students from over 50 universities held a central rally in Hibiya Park, holding up banners in the rain. The rally passed a resolution protesting against the United States and Britain conducting nuclear weapons tests despite world opinion and after the Soviet Union unilaterally ceased nuclear weapons testing, and demanding that the United States and Britain immediately cease this action.

　　Another resolution passed by the rally strongly protested against the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China and opposed the Kishi Nobusuke government's conspiracy to follow the United States in attempting to establish a Northeast Asia Treaty Organization. The resolution demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government abolish the treaty between Japan and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and immediately restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China.

　　In a declaration it passed, the rally stated that Japanese students must unite, resolutely launch a struggle to safeguard peace and democracy, and support the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party in a joint effort to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government.

　　Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, and the Japan-China Friendship Association spoke at the meeting.

　　After the rally, all the participants marched to the embassies of the United States and Britain in Tokyo and the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese government to hold demonstrations, and handed over protest letters to the embassies of the United States and Britain in Tokyo.
