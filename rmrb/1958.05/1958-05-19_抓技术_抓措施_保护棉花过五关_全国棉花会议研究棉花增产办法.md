Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 18th. The Ministry of Agriculture convened a national cotton conference of twelve major cotton-producing provinces from the 11th to the 16th in Xinxiang County, Henan Province. The meeting focused on studying technical measures such as cotton field management this year.

Currently, these provinces have completed planting over 87 million mu of cotton, accounting for more than 99% of the plan. Areas that have not completed the planting plan are adopting methods such as seedling raising in nutrient pots and square grids to expand the planting of wheat stubble cotton, ensuring the completion or over-completion of the state planting task. Now cotton seedlings are growing vigorously, and various places have entered a new stage of seedling protection and thinning management.

The meeting believed that the nationwide intense summer harvesting and planting work is approaching. During this period, cotton pests will occur in large numbers; the rainy season in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins may arrive earlier; although a lot of base fertilizer was applied to cotton fields this year, it will not be effective during the seedling stage. In order to promote strong cotton growth and ensure a bumper harvest, we must overcome five hurdles in cotton field management this year: First, the pest hurdle. Cotton aphids have already appeared. All localities must start early, use all available manpower and resources, and seize the favorable opportunity before wheat harvest to concentrate on exterminating them, so as to be more conducive to summer harvesting and planting. Second, the weed hurdle. Now summer has arrived, with more rain and vigorous grass growth, and at the same time there are more agricultural tasks. If cotton fields are not well managed, cotton will be in danger of being "eaten" by weeds. Every agricultural cooperative must organize labor to continuously weed and protect seedlings, which is conducive to cotton growth and development. Third, the drought and flood hurdle. Vigorously build irrigation and drainage projects in cotton fields to ensure a bumper harvest in both drought and rain. Fourth, the topdressing hurdle. This year, there is a lot of base fertilizer in cotton fields. In order to accelerate cotton growth, a large amount of topdressing fertilizer must also be applied, and the advanced experience of "eating less and more meals" of applying fertilizer in stages and layers in Macheng County, Hubei, should be vigorously promoted to prevent cotton from growing too fast. Fifth, the bumper harvest hurdle. According to the analysis of the meeting, if the country does not encounter special natural disasters that are irresistible to manpower this year, a bumper cotton harvest is promising. All localities need to make persistent efforts to promote early maturity and a bumper harvest of cotton, and make preparations for cotton harvesting and storage ideologically as soon as possible.

The meeting specifically pointed out that this year, low-yield cotton fields account for 20 million mu, and a part of new cotton areas has been expanded north of the Yellow River, and there are also 5 million mu of cotton and wheat double-cropping cotton. How to tap the potential and continue to increase the unit area yield of cotton in these areas has great political and economic significance. Therefore, when implementing the working methods of the mass line such as grasping both ends to lead the middle and competition and comparison, all localities must effectively grasp the various weak links in cotton production and further strengthen political education and technical instruction to cotton farmers to ensure a comprehensive great leap forward in national cotton production.

According to reports, various localities are currently strengthening the early management of cotton fields. Xinxiang, Luoyang, Xuchang, Nanyang and other special districts in Henan Province have universally implemented the management method of "three guarantees and four requirements in the field," specifically stipulating the output target, yield increase measures, technical quality, and labor work points for each cotton field, and fixing the management of cotton fields to households and individuals to strengthen the responsibility system for cotton field management. In the past, the biggest factors affecting cotton production in Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui provinces were waterlogging disasters. This year, due to vigorously building water conservancy projects, especially taking measures such as digging deep ditches and ponds, dredging and excavating rivers, building ditches and ridges, lowering the groundwater level, increasing storage capacity, and mechanized and electrical drainage, most cotton fields can now avoid the threat of rain and waterlogging, and ensure that rainfall of 200 to 300 millimeters will not cause waterlogging.

The meeting pointed out that the state will also support cotton-producing areas with 200,000 tons of chemical fertilizers and a large number of pesticides and agricultural machinery this year, and has planned 16 million mu of cotton fields in the main cotton-producing areas of the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, specifically as fertilizer yield increase experimental fields.

Finally, the meeting also specifically studied specific issues such as prioritizing water conservancy and mechanization in cotton-producing areas, and the supply of materials next year.

Responsible comrades in charge of cotton from the agricultural departments of twelve provinces, including Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Liaoning, and experts from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other organizations also attended the meeting.

　　抓技术　抓措施　保护棉花过五关
    全国棉花会议研究棉花增产办法
    新华社郑州18日电　农业部11日至16日在河南省新乡县召开了全国十二个主要产棉省的棉花会议。会议着重研究了今年棉田管理等技术措施。
    目前，这些省棉花播种已完成八千七百多万亩，占计划99％以上，没有完成种植计划的地区正采用营养钵、方格育苗等办法扩种麦茬棉，保证完成或超额完成国家种植任务。现在棉苗生长肥旺，各地已进入保苗和间苗管理的新阶段。
    会议认为，全国紧张的夏收夏种工作已经逼近，在此期间，棉花虫害将大量发生；长江、黄河流域雨季可能提前到来；今年棉田底肥虽然施的很多，但在幼苗期间还使不上劲，为了促使棉花生长健壮保证丰收，今年在棉田管理工作上必须过好五关：一、虫害关。当前棉花蚜虫已经发生，各地必须及早动手，利用一切可以利用的人力物力，抓住麦收前有利时机，集中歼灭，以便更有利于夏收夏种。二、杂草关。现在夏季已到，雨多、草旺，同时农活又多，棉田如果管理不善，棉花就有被杂草“吃掉”的危险，各个农业社一定要组织劳力，持续不断地除草保苗，有利于棉花生长发育。三、旱涝关。大力兴修棉田沟、畦灌溉和排水工程，保证干旱和雨涝都能保证丰收。四、追肥关。今年棉田底肥多，为了加速棉花生长，还要增施大量追肥，并大力推行湖北麻城县的“少吃多餐”分期、分层施肥的先进经验，防止棉花发生陡长现象。五、丰收关。根据会议分析，今年全国棉花如不遇人力不可抗拒的特大自然灾害，丰收大有希望。各地需要再接再厉促使棉花早熟丰收，并且在思想上及早做好收棉和贮棉准备。
    会议特别指出，今年棉花低产区棉田占二千万亩，黄河北部还扩大一部分新棉区，并有五百万亩棉、麦两熟棉花。怎样挖掘潜力，继续提高这些地区棉花单位面积产量，具有重大政治意义和经济意义。因此，各地在贯彻执行抓两头带中间和竞赛评比等群众路线的工作方法时，要切实抓住棉花生产上的各种薄弱环节，进一步向棉农加强政治教育和技术传授工作，以保证全国棉花生产全面大跃进。
    根据汇报，各地目前正在加强棉田前期管理工作。河南省新乡、洛阳、许昌、南阳等专区普遍推行了“三包四到田”的经营管理办法，将产量指标、增产措施、技术质量、劳动工分等具体规定到每一块棉田，并把棉田的经营管理工作固定到户，到人，加强棉田管理的责任制。河北、江苏、山东、安徽等省往年影响棉花产量的最大因素是水涝灾害。今年，这些地区由于大力兴修水利，特别是采取挖深沟塘，疏浚与开挖河道，修筑沟洫、畦田，降低地下水位，增加容蓄量和机电排水等措施，目前绝大多数棉田可以免除雨涝的威胁，并且保证一次降雨二百到三百公厘不受涝。
    会议指出，国家今年还支援棉区二十万吨化学肥料和大批农药、农械，并在长江、黄河流域主要棉区规划出一千六百万亩棉田，专门作为化肥增产试验田。
    会议最后还专门研究了棉区优先水利化、机械化和明年物资供应等具体问题。
    参加这次会议的有河南、河北、山东、江苏、浙江、安徽、陕西、山西、湖北、湖南、江西、辽宁十二个省和六个重点县农业部门主管棉花的负责同志和中国农业科学院等专家也参加了会议。
