    "Well Work Experience"
    After the promulgation of the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), all parts of the country carried out planning work for farmland water conservancy construction in order to "basically eliminate ordinary floods and droughts within twelve years" and ensure increased agricultural production. In order to exchange experiences and meet the needs of various localities to vigorously develop underground water conservancy resources, the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Water Conservancy specially selected some of the more successful experiences from the booklets compiled and printed by the water conservancy departments of various localities, and compiled them into a book entitled "Well Work Experience," which was published in two volumes. The first volume has been published recently by the Water Conservancy Publishing House. In order to meet the urgent needs of agricultural cooperatives and county and township leading organs in various localities to learn about well-related knowledge, the Farmland Water Conservancy Bureau of the Ministry of Water Conservancy specially compiled a set of "Well Wall Charts," which has recently been published by the Science Popularization Publishing House. The wall charts introduce knowledge of groundwater, types and structures of wells, methods of transforming semi-finished wells to expand water volume, safety matters for well digging, and several aspects of well water irrigation.　　　(Shu Wen)
