	Half-Month Agricultural Situation
	“Grain Rain” (April 20th) “Start of Summer” (May 6th)

	The summer harvest crops in vast areas continue to ripen from south to north. In most areas of the Yangtze River basin, rapeseed has entered its peak harvest season, and the wheat harvest is not far away. Agricultural cooperatives in these areas have generally begun specific preparations for the summer harvest and planting. In Xiangyang Prefecture, Hubei Province, by early May, more than 80% of the agricultural cooperatives in the entire prefecture had made labor plans for the summer harvest and planting. Yicheng, Nanzhang, Guanghua and other counties have also repaired nearly twice as many rice threshing grounds and two to three times more warehouses than last year for this year's summer harvest. Purchasing wheat harvesting tools and threshing tools is also an important part of the preparatory work in many areas.

	In some areas, wheat has been hit by natural disasters such as waterlogging, drought, diseases, and insect pests during this period. Agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces are fighting against rain and floods that threaten the wheat harvest. In some arid areas of Hebei Province, drought resistance and wheat protection are listed as important agricultural tasks. Jiangsu, Anhui, Shaanxi and other provinces have successively discovered varying degrees of wheat diseases. While fighting other natural disasters, these areas have also organized a large amount of manpower and material resources to strengthen this aspect of work.

	Early rice in the provinces of the Yangtze River basin has been mostly or basically transplanted before "Start of Summer". The early transplanted early rice has turned green and field management has begun. Strengthening the management of early rice fields is an important link in striving for increased early rice production, and many regions have attached great importance to this work this year.

	Most rice-producing areas in the south have started preparing for late rice production immediately after the early rice transplanting. Sichuan Province, which will plant 15 million mu of double-cropping late rice this year, studied and deployed this year's late rice production at the end of April. Jiangxi Province also made arrangements in early May to achieve this year's late rice planting plan. In areas with earlier seasons, late rice seedlings have been started before "Start of Summer".

	Cotton in the Yellow River basin and Yangtze River basin cotton areas has generally taken root and emerged, most have emerged, and some have shown true leaves. Agricultural cooperatives in various cotton areas have started various cotton seedling protection activities during this period. Most areas in the Yellow River basin cotton area are carrying out seedling checking and replanting; some arid areas carried out large-scale replanting and resowing before "Start of Summer". In Liaocheng Prefecture, Shandong Province, 200,000 mu of cotton fields were replanted, and 10,000 mu of cotton fields were resown. Cotton seedlings in some rainy areas in the south have begun to suffer from rain damage. In order to ensure full and strong seedlings, some counties have adopted the method of rushing to thin cotton fields in the rain.

	During this period, many areas are also continuing tea picking, silkworm rearing and other production activities. Spring tea production in most tea areas has entered its peak season. Anhui Province, where tea picking and tea making have entered their peak, has seen an initial picking volume of spring tea three times higher than the same period last year. Spring silkworms in Zhejiang Province have reached their peak, and the mulberry gardens throughout the province are green. Sixty-eight counties and cities have begun raising spring silkworms.

### 半月农情  “谷雨”（4月20日）“立夏”（5月6日）

    半月农情
    “谷雨”（4月20日）“立夏”（5月6日）
    广大地区的夏收作物，继续由南向北成熟着。长江流域大部地区的油菜已进入收获盛期，小麦的开始收获也为期不远了。这些地区的农业社，普遍开始了夏收夏种的具体准备。湖北襄阳专区，到5月初全专区就有80％以上的农业社作好了夏收夏种的劳力规划。宜城、南漳、光化等县还为今年夏收整修了比去年多近一倍的稻场和比去年多二、三倍的仓房。购置收麦工具和脱粒工具也是许多地区准备工作的重要环节。
    一些地区的小麦，在这个阶段里分别受到水、旱、病、虫等自然灾害袭击。江苏、浙江等省的农业社，正在和威胁小麦丰收的雨涝进行斗争。河北省部分干旱地区，都把抗旱保麦列为当前农业上的重要事情。江苏、安徽、陕西等省先后发现不同程度的小麦病害，这样的地区在向别的自然灾害斗争的同时，还组织了大量人力、物力，加强这一方面工作。
    长江流域各省的早稻在“立夏”以前已大部插完或基本插完。早插的早稻已经转青并开始了田间管理。加强对早稻田的管理是争取早稻增产的一个重要环节，今年许多地区都很重视这项工作。
    南方多数稻区紧接着早稻插秧之后，又开始了准备晚稻生产的工作。今年将种植一千五百万亩双季晚稻的四川省，已在4月底研究布置了今年的晚稻生产。江西省也在5月初为实现今年晚稻播种计划作了安排。季节较早地区，已在“立夏”前开始了晚稻育秧。
    黄河流域、长江流域棉区的棉花已普遍札根顶土，多数已经出苗，部分现了真叶。各棉区农业社都在这个阶段里开始了多样的棉花保苗活动。黄河流域棉区多数地区在进行查苗补苗；部分干旱地区，在“立夏”以前进行了大片补种和重播。山东聊城专区补种的棉田有二十万亩，重播的棉田有一万亩。南方部分多雨地区的棉苗，开始受到雨害。为了保证苗全、苗壮，有些县采用了冒雨突击的方法进行棉田的间苗。
    在这个阶段里，许多地区也在继续进行着采茶、饲蚕等生产活动。多数茶区的春茶生产已进入旺季。采茶制茶已迈进高峰的安徽省，今年春茶的初期采摘量比去年同期多三倍。浙江省的春蚕已到旺汛，全省桑园一片青绿，开始饲养春蚕的县、市已有六十八个。
