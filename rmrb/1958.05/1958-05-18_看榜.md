Looking at the List
Poem by Ding Li
Painting by Li Hongren

　　Old Man Yang is full of smiles and high spirits,
　　His snow-white beard flutters wildly in the wind.
　　He's not just idly strolling on the street,
　　He's going to the alley entrance to see the voter list.

　　He thinks: I used to be completely illiterate,
　　Barely able to recognize a few large characters.
　　Last time during the general election, I had to bring my granddaughter to see the list,
　　Unable to read the names, I only saw a joyful red glow.

　　This time during the election, I've already learned over a thousand characters,
　　I can read letters, read newspapers, and even read articles.
　　Happily, he squeezed into the crowd to look at the list,
　　Look! He found his own name right in the center of the list.

　　He squinted his eyes, looking again and again,
　　The list is full of neighbors and folks from the streets,
　　He wants to pick the best among the good people,
　　So many heroes and role models are by his side...

　　看榜
　　丁力诗
　　李宏仁画
　　杨老汉春风满面精神爽，
　　雪白的胡须迎着风儿乱飘扬。
　　不是没事到街上来闲逛，
　　他是到胡同口来看选民榜。
　　他想：我本来是个大文盲，
　　斗大的字识不了小半筐。
　　上次普选时要带孙女来看榜，
　　不识名字只见红光一片喜洋洋。
　　这次选举时我已认识生字一千多，
　　能看信，能看报，还能读文章。
　　欢欢喜喜挤在人群中来看榜，
　　瞧！找见了自己的名字正在榜中央。
　　他眯着眼睛看了又看望了又望，
　　满榜都是左邻右舍众街坊，
　　他要在好人里头挑好人，
　　多少英雄模范都在他身旁……
