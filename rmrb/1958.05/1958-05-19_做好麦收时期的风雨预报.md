　　Do a Good Job of Wind and Rain Forecasts During Wheat Harvest Season
    Meteorological Science Research Institute of the Central Meteorological Bureau
    Between spring and summer, the weather in China is complex and changeable. In the past half month, some areas in southern China have suffered from wind, rain, and hail. Such weather may still occur in the coming month. The wheat harvest season in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins often experiences strong winds. Strong winds can blow down wheat stalks and cause grain to fall off; continuous rain (霉雨) can easily cause wheat grains to fall and also cause wheat to sprout and rot. According to the experience of agricultural production units in various regions, timely harvesting before wind and rain is an important measure to reduce or avoid losses and increase yields.

    In order to accomplish this task, each meteorological observatory and station must, under the leadership of the local Party committee and government, make the greatest effort to produce more timely, more accurate, and longer-term wind and rain forecasts. At the same time, strengthen the organizational mobilization work in this area, so that "every township listens to forecasts, every commune uses forecasts, and everyone believes in forecasts."

    In order to accomplish this task, each meteorological observatory should strengthen its sense of responsibility, strictly adhere to the duty roster system and collective consultation system, frequently exchange information with other departments, closely monitor wind and rain conditions, and promptly make supplementary and revised weather forecasts. In order to make wind and rain forecasts more accurate, timely, and better serve production, each meteorological observatory and station should also organize an intelligence network for disastrous weather (such as strong winds, thunderstorms, hail, etc.), and temporarily increase some observation tasks (upper air or surface) when necessary; send mobile forecasting teams to conduct on-site forecasting services, help farmers correctly use forecasts, provide as many measures as possible to prevent natural disasters, and, on the basis of the weather forecasts released by the meteorological observatory, pay close attention to the evolution of local weather, and combine local weather change patterns and the experience of veteran farmers to conduct single-station supplementary and revised forecasts.

　　做好麦收时期的风雨预报
    中央气象局气象科学研究所
    春夏之交我国天气变化复杂，过去半个月江南部分地区已遭受风、雨、冰雹的侵袭，今后一个月中这种天气还会出现。黄河流域和长江流域麦收季节常有大风。大风可以吹倒麦株，脱落麦粒；霉雨不但容易造成小麦落粒，而且会使小麦发芽霉烂。根据各地农业生产单位的经验，风前雨前及时收割，是减少或避免损失，提高产量的一个重要措施。
    各气象台、气象（候）站为了完成这个任务，必须在当地党委和政府的领导下，以最大的努力做出更及时更准确和更长时效的风、雨预报。同时加强这一方面的组织动员工作，做到“乡乡收听预报、社社使用预报，人人相信预报”。
    为了完成这个任务，各气象台应加强工作责任心，严格值班制度、集体会商制度，经常和其他部门交换情报，密切注视风情雨情，及时作出补充订正的天气预报。为了使风雨预报更准确、及时和更好为生产服务，各气象台、站还应当组织灾害性天气（如大风、雷雨、冰雹等）情报网，必要时临时增加一些观测（高空或地面）任务；派出流动预报组进行现场的预报服务，帮助农民正确地使用预报，尽可能提供一些预防自然灾害的措施和在气象台发布的天气预报基础上，密切注意当地天气的演变，结合地方性天气变化规律和老农的经验，进行单站补充订正预报。
