Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 25th: Hunan Province, through the concerted efforts of its mountainous, hilly, and plain regions, has continuously overcome seven major floods. The arduous battle against flooding and waterlogging continues throughout the province, with millions of farmers mobilized daily, operating over 110,000 dragon-bone waterwheels day and night, draining water, fighting floods, and replanting crops. More than 1.55 million mu of rice seedlings affected by waterlogging in the Dongting Lake area have had the water drained for the seventh time, and the green seedlings have reappeared. Despite waterlogging reaching about one foot each time, the water is generally drained within 24 hours. In the mountainous areas, production has basically recovered within six or seven days in the regions affected by mountain floods.

Since April 26th, continuous rainfall has plagued various parts of Hunan, with the average rainfall more than double that of the same period last year. This year, the rain has been prolonged and intense, with particularly heavy rainfall in the lower reaches of the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li rivers. Consequently, waterlogging in the lake areas started early and was severe. In many places, water has been drained repeatedly, six or seven times. Some cadres and farmers began to waver in the face of the disaster, lacking confidence in achieving a bumper harvest this year. Some also harbored a侥倖 psychology, hoping the weather would clear up on its own. In response to these harmful ideas, local Party committees promptly organized the masses to conduct field debates and mobilized neighboring townships and communes to provide full support, helping to solve difficulties such as labor, seedlings, and seeds. In Xin'nan Cooperative in Nanxian County, when 1,600 mu of waterlogged fields were being drained for the fourth time, half of the households requested to move and find alternative livelihoods. The township immediately organized more than 200 people from nearby agricultural cooperatives with higher terrain, carrying waterwheels, leading plowing cattle, and carrying seedlings to provide assistance. In two days, they drained all the water from the cooperative and replanted twenty mu of drowned rice seedlings. Since then, no one in Xin'nan Cooperative has suggested moving.

    互相协作　坚定信心
    湖南农民战胜七次洪水
    据新华社长沙25日电　湖南省山区、丘陵区和平原地区通力协作，连续战胜七次较大的洪水。现在全省抗洪排渍的艰苦战斗仍在继续进行，每天出动几百万农民，架起十一万多部龙骨水车，日夜车水，抗洪排渍，补种补插。洞庭湖滨被渍的一百五十五万多亩禾苗，已经是第七次排干渍水，重现青苗。尽管每次都是平地渍水一尺左右，一般在一昼夜就排干了。在山区，山洪袭击过的地区，也都只有六七天，就基本上恢复了生产。
    从4月26日以来，湖南各地阴雨连绵，一般降雨量较去年同期增加两倍，今年雨下得久，下得猛，湘、资、沅、澧四水下游雨量较大，因此湖区渍水来得早，也来得猛。很多地方的渍水反复排了六七次。有些干部和农民在灾害前面开始有些动摇，对今年丰产信心不大，也有些人存在坐等天晴的侥幸心理。各地党委针对上述有害思想，及时组织群众开展田间辩论，并发动邻乡邻社全力支援，帮助解决劳力、秧苗、种子等困难问题。南县新南社一千六百多亩受渍田在第四次排渍水时，有半数户要求搬家，另谋生计。乡里立即组织附近地势较高的农业社出动二百多人，扛着水车，牵着耕牛，挑着秧苗，前来支援。两天就把这个社的渍水全部排干，把二十亩淹死的禾苗重新插好。从此新南社再也没有人提出搬家了。（附图片）
