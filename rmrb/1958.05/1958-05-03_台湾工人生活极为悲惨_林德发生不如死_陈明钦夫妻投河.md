Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 2nd: Taipei dispatch: A Taipei newspaper recently reported the tragic experience of a worker's family in Taipei under the title of "A Suffering Family Struggling in the Darkness." The worker's name is Lin Defa. He used to be a coal miner, but he suffered from severe lung disease due to overwork in the mine and the extremely harsh working conditions in the mine. He couldn't continue working, but his family depended on him for a living, so he had to push a cart day and night in the streets and alleys of Taipei to sell noodles. Extreme poverty made his lung disease worse. Last December, in desperation due to poverty and illness, he drank kerosene to commit suicide while his family members were away. Fortunately, he was discovered early and saved after treatment, but his situation became even more miserable than death. Swallowing kerosene caused a series of complications: esophageal obstruction, cirrhosis, and stomach problems. His wife had to guard him by the bed all day to prevent him from committing suicide a second time. Their eldest son was forcibly conscripted into the army by the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and the livelihood of the family of six depended only on the temporary work of the second son to subsidize them a little; while his blind old mother and young son had to go out to beg for leftover food to survive.

Such worker families are not unique to Lin Defa in Taiwan. A few days ago, a couple in Taipei committed suicide by drowning in the river at night because they were heavily in debt and unable to repay it. The man's name was Chen Mingqin, and he worked as a handyman in an organization. Before jumping into the river to commit suicide, the couple drank and wept at home, a very tragic scene.

These few incidents are only the bits and pieces revealed by Taiwanese newspapers in the three days from April 15th to 18th.

    台湾工人生活极为悲惨
    林德发生不如死　陈明钦夫妻投河
    新华社广州2日电　台北消息：台北市一家报纸最近以“黑暗中挣扎的苦难家庭”为题，报道了台北市一个工人家庭的悲惨遭遇。这个工人名叫林德发，原来是煤矿工人，因在矿井中过度劳累和矿井劳动条件极为恶劣，患了严重的肺病。他再干不下去了，但一家的生活要靠他维持，只好在台北市推着车子日夜到大街小巷卖面食。极端贫困的生活使他的肺病日益加重。去年12月他在贫病交迫走投无路之际，乘亲人不在服下煤油自杀。幸及早发现，经救治保全了生命，但境遇却比死去更悲惨。由于吞下煤油，引起了一系列的并发症：食道淤塞、肝硬化和胃病等。他的妻子为防止他第二次自杀，只好整天守护床前。他们的长子被蒋介石集团强拉去当兵，一家六口生计仅靠次子临时做工补贴一点维持；而他双目失明的老母和幼子，已不得不出去乞讨残汤剩饭度日。
    像这样的工人家庭，在台湾并不是林德发一家。数日前，台北市又发生了一对夫妇因负债垒垒无法清偿，而在深夜双双投河自杀死去。男的叫陈明钦，在一个机关里当杂役。跳河自杀前，他们夫妻曾在家里饮酒对泣，情景极为凄惨。
    这几件事仅是4月15日到18日三天台湾报纸透露的点滴情况。
