A Vital Component

    The people's transportation industry (including wooden sailboats, manual and animal-powered vehicles, loading and unloading, etc.) is a vital component of transportation. It employs approximately two million people, accounting for half of the national transportation workforce. It possesses 250,000 wooden sailboats, with a carrying capacity of 3 million tons; and 560,000 manual and animal-powered vehicles, with a carrying capacity of approximately 500,000 tons, undertaking more than 80% of local freight volume and more than 50% of the transportation turnover. Half of the total national freight volume also needs to be concentrated and dispersed through it. Whenever transportation is strained or blocked in some areas, it often seeks assistance from the people's transportation industry. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China fully recognized the role of the people's transportation industry in China's socialist construction and established the policy of "fully utilizing, appropriately developing, and gradually carrying out technical improvements." Facts have proven that this policy is entirely correct. In the current situation of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, with a large increase in freight volume and insufficient transport capacity, it is even more necessary to fully utilize the strength of the people's transportation industry.

    Over the past few years, under the leadership of local Party committees, the people's transportation sector has done a lot of work. It has achieved many successes in the struggle against feudal foremen, socialist transformation, and strengthening transportation organization, which should be affirmed. However, it is undeniable that many localities do not pay enough attention to and do not grasp the leadership of the people's transportation industry tightly enough. By the end of 1957, 20% to 30% of the people in the people's transportation industry had not undergone socialist transformation; and those who were organized were mostly elementary cooperatives, or self-supporting mutual aid teams and groups. The spontaneous capitalist tendencies of small producers within the cooperatives were quite serious. Many cooperatives and members did not comply with the regulations on unified freight rates, unified allocation, and unified dispatching, and privately solicited goods, privately raised freight rates, illegally purchased state grain, and stole the goods of cargo owners. The business management of the cooperatives was also very chaotic, with widespread corruption, waste, embezzlement of public funds, damage to tools, and deaths of livestock. In terms of income distribution, many cooperatives one-sidedly emphasized "deducting less and distributing more," which was actually "eating it all up," fostering many members' extravagant eating, drinking, and wasting, and pursuing "five major items" such as watches, bicycles, radios, sewing machines, and woolen clothes; while the cooperatives were heavily in debt. The political situation of the practitioners was also relatively complex, including scattered Kuomintang generals, colonels, captains, receiving officials, special agent bosses, "emperors" and "princes consort" of reactionary secret societies, and counter-revolutionary elements and bad elements such as escaped landlords. Some even usurped the leadership of the cooperatives or teams, and blatantly carried out sabotage activities. This shows that the struggle between two lines is very sharp in transportation cooperatives. Many transportation cooperatives and loading and unloading cooperatives (teams, stations) have not only failed to complete the task of socialist transformation, but also failed to thoroughly complete the task of democratic reform. This is obviously detrimental to the consolidation, development, and socialist construction of transportation cooperatives.
  Rectification Brings a
  New Atmosphere

    Since the rectification movement, the situation of the people's transportation industry has been or is undergoing fundamental changes. All localities have formulated plans, put forward requirements, and transferred the necessary number of cadres to specifically guide the rectification and cooperative consolidation movement, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and based on the specific conditions of the cooperatives, and have achieved great results. It is estimated that the rectification and cooperative consolidation work can be completed in most cooperatives by the end of June, and some cooperatives may continue to carry out this work after June.

    All the transportation cooperatives that have undergone rectification and cooperative consolidation have changed and are changing their old faces and have presented a brand new atmosphere. The socialist political and ideological awareness of the vast number of members has generally improved, and the leadership style of the cadres has also undergone great changes. Everyone is firmly united to take the road of socialist collectivization. Those who were active have become more active, those who were wavering have become firmer, and those who withdrew have returned voluntarily. The situation in which small owners held power in the past has changed, and workers and poor independent laborers have truly gained the advantage of leadership in the cooperatives. Small owners and capitalists have accepted transformation, bad people have been punished as they deserved, and many elementary cooperatives have quickly transformed into advanced cooperatives. The principles of democratic management and thrift in running cooperatives have been further implemented. This series of changes has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the vast number of members, and the freight volume of many cooperatives has doubled. The wooden sailboat transportation cooperative in Xiaguan District, Nanjing, from Nanjing to Shanghai, a round trip of 750 kilometers, used to take 25 days to a month before the rectification, but now it generally takes only half a month, and the fastest only takes 12 days, sometimes even catching up with the speed of ships. The production efficiency of the cooperative led by the Hankou Port Wooden Sailboat Management Station has also increased by nearly one time. Before the rectification, the average monthly output per ton of boat was 375 ton-kilometers, and after the rectification, it reached more than 600 ton-kilometers. All cooperatives in the port have guaranteed that the average annual output per ton of boat will reach more than 8,000 ton-kilometers this year, an increase of 80% compared to the actual output last year. At present, many cooperatives have put forward the fighting goal of "working hard for three to five years to realize mechanization," and the action slogan of many wooden sailboat cooperatives is: "Stars and moon as daytime, small winds and small rains as good days, loading and unloading during the day, sailing at night, not giving way to tailwinds, not stopping in headwinds." This heroic spirit fully demonstrates their drive to strive for the upstream. From these examples, it can be seen that after the people's transportation industry has undergone further economic transformation and a great revolution in politics and ideology, the productive forces have been greatly liberated, and a new situation of a great leap forward in transportation has emerged. The emergence of this new situation also shows that the Central Committee's point that "the rectification movement is the key to promoting all work" is completely correct. For transportation cooperatives, the rectification movement is also an important step that cannot be bypassed to thoroughly solve various problems existing in the cooperatives and change the face of the cooperatives. Therefore, in areas where the rectification and cooperative consolidation has not yet ended or is in progress, do not relax the leadership of the rectification and cooperative consolidation work, but carry out the rectification and cooperative consolidation movement to the end in order to achieve complete victory.
    A Technical Revolution Must Be Carried Out

    With the victory of the economic, ideological, and political revolutionary struggles of the people's transportation industry, and the needs of the development of industrial and agricultural production, a new task of technical revolution has been put forward to the people's transportation industry. At present, the tools of the people's transportation industry are very backward. In a large part of the transportation industry, the handicraft tools of the old era still occupy a dominant position, and the vast number of laborers have not yet been liberated from heavy physical labor. A technical revolution must be carried out to gradually change heavy physical labor into semi-mechanized and mechanized labor. This is not only a question related to the future development direction and prospects of the people's transportation industry, but also a question related to the development policy of local transportation.

    There are two ways to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of the transportation industry: one is to rely solely on state investment to purchase ships, automobiles, and loading and unloading machinery to replace backward people's transportation tools; the other is to fully rely on the strength of the masses and rely on the funds accumulated by the transportation cooperatives themselves to purchase modernized transportation tools, in addition to state investment. Compared with the two, it is more advantageous to take the method of relying on the masses. In this way, not only can the state's investment in this area be saved, but also the members' enthusiasm for production can be brought into play, so as to develop the transportation industry more, faster, better, and more economically.

    There are different opinions among many people on the issue of relying on the strength of transportation cooperatives to realize semi-mechanization and mechanization. Some people hold a skeptical attitude. They believe that: "The development of modern transportation tools by the people's transportation industry is playing against the state-owned transportation industry, which will increase the contradictions between the two types of economy." This view is inappropriate. From the overall point of view, the current transportation capacity is not too much, but greatly insufficient, and it is necessary to develop transport capacity from all aspects. The organized transportation cooperatives and state-owned transportation enterprises are both socialist public ownership, and there will be no and should be no fundamental conflict of interest. At the same time, with the improvement of the degree of mechanization, transportation cooperatives will gradually transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people in the future. Therefore, the worry of "playing against the state" is unnecessary.

    The technical revolution of the people's transportation industry must put forward different levels of requirements according to different regions and different conditions. In developed large and medium-sized cities and transportation trunk lines, the requirements can be higher; in small towns and small river tributaries and branch lines, the requirements can be lower. Be sure to purchase different mechanical transport tools according to your own specific conditions. Some mainly buy large trucks, three-wheeled trucks, tractors, battery cars, tugboats, motorized sailboats, hoisting, conveying, and beach winch equipment, etc., and some mainly engage in four-wheeled machine-horse dual-purpose vehicles, iron-wooden wheeled vehicles with bearings and tape, etc. Some areas that currently mainly rely on people to carry on their backs and shoulders mainly repair roads and straighten rivers to realize transportation vehicle and boat transportation. Do not deviate from the specific local conditions and blindly pursue mechanization. At the same time, in the process of engaging in modern transportation tools, it is also necessary to prevent relaxing the utilization, maintenance, and improvement of the original transportation tools, so as to avoid losses. It must be recognized that the existing backward tools are the basis for realizing mechanization, and in the long term, many places will still need it. If the transportation cooperative does not need it, it should also be transferred to agricultural cooperatives or other regions in a planned way for continued use.

    From the current conditions in our country, the manufacture and supply of mechanized tools can also be solved. In addition to being manufactured by central state-owned enterprises, the strength of local industry and handicrafts can be fully used. Now Shanghai, Shenyang, Qingdao, Chongqing, Wuhu, Guiyang and other cities have successfully trial-produced trucks or three-wheeled trucks, and many other places can manufacture and install other transportation machinery. Although there may still be some difficulties in the supply of machinery this year, it is estimated that it can be supplied in large quantities in the future. Therefore, the speed of realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization in the people's transportation industry will be quite fast, not very slow. We believe that it is necessary to propose in the transportation cooperatives: strive to basically realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of the people's transportation industry in most areas in five years or a little longer, as a fighting goal, to encourage the enthusiasm of the vast number of members.

    The operating forms of mechanized tools can be operated by one cooperative, operated by a joint cooperative, or jointly operated by state-owned and cooperative. This needs to be adapted to local conditions, but generally should not be transferred to state-owned too early in order to better play the enthusiasm of the cooperatives. As for some loading and unloading cooperatives (stations, teams) in large and medium-sized cities that have indeed met the conditions for being transferred to state-owned, they can also be transferred to state-owned after deliberation and preparation.

    In order to realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of transportation cooperatives, all localities should make plans this year, formulate specific measures, and do pilot work. At the same time, specific preparations must also be made in the manufacture of machinery, the supply of fuel and materials, and the training of technical personnel to create the necessary conditions for the development of mechanization in the future.
  Pay Attention to the Accumulation of Transportation Cooperatives

    In order to consolidate and develop the socialist economic foundation of transportation cooperatives and accelerate the realization of semi-mechanization and mechanization, the relationship between consumption and accumulation in transportation cooperatives must be properly resolved. The success or failure of solving this problem has a direct relationship to the leap forward in transportation production. The current situation, as mentioned earlier, is that generally members are divided too much (the income of many members exceeds the income of other workers in the local area), and there is too little accumulation in the cooperatives, and many cooperatives often rely on bank loans to maintain expenses. If this situation is not changed quickly, it will not only affect the consolidation and development of the cooperatives themselves, but also be detrimental to the ideological transformation of the vast number of members in promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately expand the proportion of public accumulation extracted by cooperatives on the basis of the rectification and cooperative consolidation this time and the improvement of members' socialist consciousness. The main method is to extract from increasing production and practicing economy. Generally, the income of members should not be reduced. Only in areas with particularly high incomes, after discussion by members, can it be considered to appropriately reduce it, so as not to damage the production enthusiasm of members.

    The funds required for the semi-mechanization and mechanization of transportation cooperatives can be completely solved by relying on their own accumulation, without the need for state investment. According to the material calculations of many cooperatives, public accumulation can reach 10% to 20% of total income in 1958, and some can even reach 30% to 40%, which is equivalent to each member accumulating 100 to 200 yuan to 300 to 400 yuan. Taking the 1.6 million people who have been organized into cooperatives as a basis for calculation, 200 million to 300 million yuan can be accumulated throughout the year. 200 million yuan is equivalent to the total local transportation investment in 1957. 200 million yuan can buy 10,000 Jiefang brand cars, or 25,000 three-wheeled trucks, or 3,000 80-horsepower shallow-water tugboats, or 20,000 motorized sailboats. This is a very large number. In fact, many transportation cooperatives have already raised a lot of funds and demanded to purchase modern transportation tools. For example, six horse-drawn carriage cooperatives in Dalian have more than 1,000 members and can accumulate more than 400,000 yuan per year. They plan to buy more than 50 three-wheeled trucks and 5 tractors this year, and 100 three-wheeled trucks and 10 Jiefang brand cars next year. In 1960, 50 Jiefang brand cars will be purchased. Mechanization can be basically realized within three years. Another example is the Yuanjiang County Wooden Sailboat Cooperative in Hunan, relying on its own accumulation, plans to install eight motorized sailboats and twenty beach winches this year, and also build a biogas power station for loading and unloading lighting, realizing semi-mechanization in five years, increasing the number of motorized sailboats to 232 in ten years, and building a repair shop. Their description of their beautiful vision is: "No need for oars to sail the boat, there is a cafeteria uphill, machines rumble, songs sing everywhere, everyone understands technology, everyone is educated, abundant food and clothing, happy family."

    The above shows that as long as the problem of accumulation is well solved, the potential of transportation cooperatives can be greatly brought into play. Some people say: "Transportation cooperatives are dilapidated, with many people and backward tools, not worth a few dollars, and are a burden." This view is wrong.
  Bring into Play the Leadership and Fortress Role of the Party

    Realizing the technical revolution of the people's transportation industry and organizing a great leap forward in production is a very arduous task, which is impossible without the strong leadership of the Party. Therefore, it is hoped that Party committees at all levels will further strengthen the leadership of the people's transportation industry. In addition to grasping the rectification and cooperative consolidation work, and organizing the scattered vehicles, scattered boats, and scattered workers that are needed and can be organized, turning elementary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, and appropriately merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives, the cooperatives in the same area are organized into joint cooperatives as needed, especially to strengthen the Party building and political and ideological work in the cooperatives. The Party's strength in the people's transportation industry is extremely weak. Most of them do not have Party branch organizations, more than half of the cooperatives do not have Party members, and the total number of Party members generally accounts for only about 1% of the total number of members. Compared with agricultural and handicraft cooperatives, this is the place with the fewest Party members. In this way, not only can the Party and the state's policies and laws not be correctly implemented in the cooperatives, but also the production and political and ideological conditions in the cooperatives are difficult to be reflected in a timely manner. Therefore, it is hoped that Party committees at all levels will earnestly pay attention to this issue, adopt various methods, and on the basis of rectification and cooperative consolidation, actively develop Party organizations in transportation cooperatives in a planned way according to the standards of Party members, and establish Party branches or general branches to play the Party's regular leading role and core fortress role in the cooperatives. If it was excusable not to develop Party organizations in the past, then it is no longer appropriate to ignore this work today, when the situation has changed and production has leaped forward.

    I believe that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, and after the great ideological liberation of all practitioners, the people's transportation industry will surely fight together with the people of the whole country to realize the general line and general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by Chairman Mao.

    民间运输业也应当来个大跃进
    中共中央交通工作部副部长　张邦英
    一个重要的组成部分
    民间运输业（包括木帆船、人力兽力车、
  装卸等），是交通运输的一个重要的组成部分。从业人员约二百万人，占全国交通运输从业人员的一半。它拥有木帆船二十五万只，载重量三百万吨；人力兽力车五十六万辆，载重量约五十万吨，担负着地方运量的80％和运输周转量的50％以上的任务。全国总运量的一半，也需要经过它进行集中和分散。每当有些地区交通运输紧张或堵塞的时候，更常常求援于民间运输业。党的八大第一次会议充分估计到民间运输业在我国社会主义建设中的作用，确定了对它采取“充分利用、适当发展和逐步进行技术改良”的方针。事实证明，这个方针是完全正确的。在目前工农业生产大跃进，运量大增、运力不足的情况下，充分利用民间运输业的力量，就显得更为必要了。
    几年来，民间运输在各地党委的领导下，曾经做了许多工作。在反对封建把头斗争、社会主义改造和加强运输组织工作等方面，获得许多的成绩，这是应当肯定的。但是也不可否认，许多地方对民间运输业的领导，还是重视不够、抓得不紧的。到1957年底止，民间运输业中还有20％到30％的人，没有进行社会主义改造；而组织起来的，也还多是初级社，或者是自负盈亏的互助队、组。合作社内小生产者的资本主义自发势力相当严重，许多社和社员不服从统一运价、统一配载、统一调度的规定，私自揽货，私抬运价，套购国家粮食和偷盗货主的东西。社的经营管理上也很混乱，普遍存在着贪污浪费、挪用公款、损坏工具和牲畜死亡的现象。在收益分配上，很多社片面地强调“少扣多分”，实际上是“吃了分光”，助长了许多社员大吃大喝、挥霍浪费和追求手表、自行车、收音机、缝纫机和毛料衣服等“五大件”；而社内则亏损累累。从业人员的政治情况也比较复杂，其中还有流散的国民党将校尉军官、接收大员、特务头子、反动会道门的“皇帝”、“驸马”，以及逃亡地主等反革命分子和坏分子。有的竟篡夺了社的或队的领导权，明目张胆地进行破坏活动。这说明两条路线的斗争在运输合作社中是很尖锐的。许多运输合作社和搬运社（队、站），不仅社会主义改造任务没有完成，就是民主改革的任务也没有彻底完成。这对于运输合作社的巩固、发展和社会主义建设事业，显然是不利的。
  整风出现了
  新气象
    自整风运动以来，民间运输业的情况，已经或正在发生着根本的变化。各地都按照中央的指示，根据合作社的特殊情况，作了规划，提出了要求，并抽调了必要数量的干部，具体指导整风整社运动，获得了很大的成绩。整风整社工作预计到6月底大部分社可以结束，有一部分社可能到6月以后还要继续进行。
    凡经过整风整社的运输合作社，已经改变了和正在改变着旧日的面貌，出现了崭新的气象。广大社员的社会主义的政治思想觉悟普遍提高，干部的领导作风也有了大的转变。大家坚决一致要走社会主义合作化的道路，积极的更加积极了，动摇的坚定了，退社的也自动回来了。过去小业主当权的情况改变了，工人、贫苦独立劳动者在社内真正取得了领导的优势。小业主和资本家接受了改造，坏人得到了应有的惩治，好些初级社很快地转为高级社了。民主办社和勤俭办社的方针，得到了进一步的贯彻执行。这一系列的改变，大大地鼓舞了广大社员的生产积极性，许多社的运量提高了一倍。南京下关区的木帆船运输合作社，从南京到上海往返七百五十公里，整风前要航行二十五天到一月，整风后一般只用半月的时间，最快的只用十二天，有时候甚至赶上轮船的速度。汉口港木帆船管理站领导的合作社，生产效率也提高了将近一倍。整风前每吨船平均月产量三百七十五吨公里，整风后达到六百吨公里以上。全港各个合作社，都保证今年每吨船平均年产量达到八千吨公里以上，较去年实际提高80％。目前许多社已经提出“苦战三、五年，实现机械化”的奋斗目标，不少木帆船社的行动口号是：“星星月亮当白天，小风小雨当好天，日装卸，夜航行，顺风不让，顶风不停”。这种豪迈的气概，充分地表现了他们力争上游的干劲。从这些例子中可以看出，民间运输业经过了经济上的进一步改造和政治上、思想上的大革命之后，生产力便大大解放出来，已在运输上出现了一个生产大跃进的新局面。这一新局面的出现，也说明中央所指出的“整风运动是推动一切工作的纲”，是完全正确的。对运输合作社来说，整风运动也是彻底解决社内存在的各种问题，改变社内面貌的不可逾越的一个重要步骤。因此，凡整风整社尚未结束或正在进行的地区，不要放松对整风整社工作的领导，而要把整风整社运动进行到底，以期获得全胜。
    要进行一个技术革命
    随着民间运输业经济上、思想上、政治上革命斗争的胜利，以及工农业生产发展的需要，向民间运输业提出了一个技术革命的新任务。目前民间运输业的工具，是十分落后的。在很大一部分交通运输业中，旧时代的手工工具还占着统治的地位，广大的劳动者还没有从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，必须进行一个技术革命，使繁重的体力劳动逐步地改变为半机械化和机械化的劳动。这不仅是一个有关民间运输业今后发展方向和前途的问题，而且是关联到地方交通运输事业发展方针的问题。
    实现运输业半机械化和机械化，可以有两种办法：一种办法是，只依靠国家投资，购买轮船、汽车、装卸机械以代替民间落后运输工具；另一种办法是，除了国家投资外，还要充分依靠群众的力量，依靠运输合作社自身积累的资金，购买近代化运输工具。两者比较起来，还是采取依靠群众的办法更为有利。这样，不仅可以节省国家在这方面的投资，而且可以发挥社员的生产积极性，做到多、快、好、省地发展交通运输事业。
    依靠运输合作社的力量实现半机械化和机械化的问题，在许多人中间，不是没有不同意见的。有的人抱着怀疑的态度。他们认为：“民间运输业发展近代运输工具是同国营运输业唱对台戏，这会增加两类经济之间的矛盾”。这种看法是不妥当的。从整个看来，目前运输力量不是多了，而是大大的不足，需要从各方面发展运力。而组织起来的运输合作社同国营运输企业，都是社会主义公有制，不会也不应该发生根本利害的矛盾。同时随着机械化程度的提高，运输合作社在将来也会由集体所有制逐步过渡到全民所有制的。因此，那种怕“唱对台戏”的顾虑是不必要的。
    民间运输业的技术革命，必须根据不同的地区、不同的条件，提出不同程度的要求。在交通发达的大中城市和运输干线，要求可以高些；在小城镇和小河支流支线，要求可以低些。一定要按自己的具体情况去购置不同的机械运输工具，有的主要是买大卡车、三轮卡车、牵引车、电瓶车、拖轮、机帆船，起重、传送、绞滩设备等，有的主要是搞四轮机马两用车、铁木轮车加轴承和胶带等。有些目前主要还靠人背肩挑的地区，则主要是修路、整河，实现运输车、船化。不要脱离当地具体条件，盲目地追求机械化。同时在搞近代运输工具的过程中，也要防止放松对原有运输工具的利用、维修和改良，以免造成损失。必须认识，现有的落后工具是实现机械化的基础，而在将来很长时间内不少地方还需要它。如果运输社不需要时，也应有计划地转给农业社或其他地区继续使用。
    机械化工具的制造和供应，从我国当前条件来看，也是能够解决的。除了由中央国营企业制造以外，可以充分使用地方工业和手工业的力量。现在上海、沈阳、青岛、重庆、芜湖、贵阳等市都试制成功载重汽车或三轮卡车等，还有许多地方能够制造和安装其他运输机械。虽然今年的机械供应还可能有某些困难，但估计以后是可以大量供应的。因此，民间运输业实现半机械化和机械化的速度将是相当快的，而不是很慢的。我们认为有必要在运输合作社中提出：争取在五年或更多一点时间内在大部分地区基本上实现民间运输业半机械化和机械化的口号，作为奋斗的目标，以鼓舞广大社员的积极性。
    机械化工具的经营形式，可以有一社经营、联社经营、或国社联营几种。这需要因地制宜，但一般不宜过早转为国营，以便更好地发挥合作社的积极性。至于有些大中城市的搬运、装卸社（站、队）确已具备了转为国营的条件的，经过酝酿准备以后，也可转为国营。
    为了实现运输合作社半机械化和机械化，各地应于今年内作好规划，订出具体的措施，并作好试点工作。同时在机械的制造，燃料、物料的供应和技术人员的培训等方面，亦须作具体的准备工作，为今后机械化的发展创造必要的条件。
  重视运输合作社的积累
    为了巩固与发展运输合作社的社会主义经济基础，加速实现半机械化和机械化，必须很好地解决运输合作社内消费和积累的关系问题。这个问题解决得好坏，对于运输业生产的跃进有着直接的关系。现在的情况，正如前面所说的：一般都是社员分得太多（许多社员的收入，超过当地其他工人的收入），社内积累太少，许多社常常靠银行贷款维持开支。这种情况如不迅速加以改变，不仅影响合作社本身的巩固与发展，而且对广大社员兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的思想改造也是不利的。因此，必须在这次整风整社、社员社会主义觉悟提高的基础上，适当地扩大合作社提取公共积累的比例。办法主要是从增产节约中去提取，一般不要降低社员的收入，只有那些收入特别高的地区，经过社员讨论，才可以考虑适当地降低，以免损伤社员的生产积极性。
    运输合作社半机械化和机械化所需要的资金，依靠自己的积累完全可以解决，而不必由国家投资。根据许多社的材料计算，公共积累在1958年可以达到总收入的10％到20％，有的甚至可以达到30％到40％，相当于每个社员积累一、二百元到三、四百元。拿已组织到合作社的一百六十万人推算，全年可积累二亿元至三亿元。二亿元就相当于1957年地方交通投资的总和。二亿元可以买解放牌汽车一万辆，或三轮卡车二万五千辆，或八十马力浅水拖轮三千艘，或装机帆船二万只。这是一个很大的数字。事实上现在已经有许多运输合作社筹集了不少资金，要求购置现代化运输工具。例如大连六个马车社，有社员一千多人，每年可以积累四十多万元。它们计划今年买三轮卡车五十多部，牵引车五台，明年买三轮卡车一百部，解放牌汽车十部。1960年买解放牌汽车五十部。三年内就可以基本上实现机械化。又如湖南沅江县木帆船合作社，靠自己的积累，今年计划要安装机帆船八只，绞滩机二十个，还要建立供装卸照明的沼气发电站一所，五年内实现半机械化，十年内机帆船增至二百三十二只，并修建修理厂一个。他们对自己美好远景的描绘是：“开船不用橹桨，上坡自有食堂，机器隆隆响，歌声四处扬，人人懂技术，个个有文化，丰衣足食，幸福人家”。
    以上说明，只要很好地解决了积累问题，运输合作社的潜力就可以大大地发挥出来。有人说：“运输合作社破破烂烂，人员多、工具落后，不值几分钱，是一个包袱”。这种看法是不对的。
  发挥党的领导和堡垒作用
    实现民间运输业的技术革命，组织生产大跃进，是一个十分艰巨的任务，没有党的坚强领导，是不可能的。因此，希望各级党委进一步加强对民间运输业的领导，除了抓紧整风整社工作，并把需要而又可以组织起来的散车、散船、散工组织起来，把初级社转为高级社、小社适当地并为大社，同一地区的社按需要组织为联社以外，尤其要加强合作社内党的建设和政治思想工作。民间运输业内党的力量极为薄弱，大部分没有党的支部组织，半数以上的社没有党员，党员总数一般仅占社员总数的1％左右，同农业和手工业合作社来比，这是党员最少的地方。这样，不仅党和国家的政策法令不能在社内正确贯彻执行，就是社内的生产和政治思想情况，也很难及时反映上来。因此，希望各级党委切实重视这一问题，采取各种办法，在整风整社的基础上，有计划地根据党员的标准，在运输合作社内积极发展党的组织，建立党的支部或总支，以发挥党在合作社内经常的领导作用和核心堡垒作用。如果说，在过去不发展党的组织，还情有可原的话，那末，在情况改变、生产跃进后的今天，再忽视这一工作，就不应该了。
    我相信，民间运输业，在各级党委的领导下，经过全体从业人员的思想大解放，一定能够同全国人民一起，为实现毛主席所提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针总路线而奋斗。
