　　The Chestnut Tree's Magic Trick
　　Qingming has long passed, and Guyu has also been over for two or three days. Spring has changed from light green to dark green, from warm to hot. Even the chestnut tree, which has been slow to sprout leaves, is covered with new green buds. These buds seem to be deliberately teasing people, turning into a tree full of green leaves overnight, as fast as a magician performing a magic trick. The peach tree has put away its bright red flowers and is thinking of ways to grow bigger and sweeter peaches. Miss Swallow is most concerned about this and often flies to the top of the tree to ask questions. We don't know how the peach tree answers, but we can believe that the peach tree is neither lazy nor stupid. Just look at how healthy and clever she grows, and you will know that she is very confident.

　　Rice Seedlings Go to Elementary School
　　The first time I saw the rice seedlings, they were just small, white sprouts inside the rice seeds. At that time, the weather was very cold, and the mountain slopes and grass huts were covered with thick frost sparkling with silver light in the mornings. The production team leader, wearing a thick cotton-padded jacket, led me to a small warehouse to see the early hatched rice seeds. He grabbed a handful from the wet rice basket to show me. How interesting! Just like newborn babies. After a few days, the rice seeds were all sown in the fields. The rectangular seedbeds were like small beds in a nursery, and these rice seeds were sent to the nursery to live. Afterwards, every evening I would meet this production team leader, carrying a shotgun, guarding the seedbeds back and forth, not allowing greedy sparrows to steal the rice seeds. Now the seedlings are more than three inches long, and they have to be divided into classes again, planted in another field, which means they are coming out of the nursery to go to elementary school. The largest seedlings are really going to school. They are lined up neatly, standing in the paddy fields. A spring breeze gently blows over them, and they nod, knowing that the spring breeze is a teacher and they should salute. However, there are still many, many seedlings waiting to go to elementary school, and the production team leader and members are busy enough dividing them into classes.

　　The Tea Tree Can't Wait
　　In winter, the tea tree does not shed its leaves. In the mountains, it can withstand the test of wind, frost, rain, and snow. However, winter is winter after all. The tea tree cannot grow tender leaves and is always dark and clustered, waiting for spring to come quickly. The tea tree is overjoyed when it sees spring and immediately spits out fresh, tender buds to welcome it. These small leaves grow very laboriously, and it takes many days to reveal a little bud. After Qingming, there were a few days when people were so hot that they couldn't wear their lined jackets, and there was also a heavy rain. The next day, the tea tree added many new leaves, as small as sunflower seeds. These leaves are still small. When Guyu arrived, there was another heavy rain, with thunder rumbling and rumbling. This was the first heavy thunderstorm of the year. The next morning, the mountaintop was still covered in a misty haze, the stream was flowing very rapidly, and the tender leaves of the tea tree had all grown up, and new, tender, and strong stems were also sticking up. The tea leaves are ready to be picked. Who will pick them? The old mothers, girls, and elementary school students in the village have made preparations and are about to go up the mountain to pick them. They can't be late for even half a day. The tea tree is very anxious to wait. If they are picked a day late, the tender leaves will be old. In fact, the production team leader in the commune is even more anxious. He has mobilized all the female labor in the team, and has also asked elementary school students and teachers to help. It is still not enough. Just in time, the middle school students from the county are coming to the township to help with production. The commune leader jumped up with joy. He said on the phone: "Come quickly, it's best to come today!"
　　The tea trees on the mountain are also preparing to sprout a second batch of tender leaves. They also want to compete with the tea pickers to see whether picking is faster or growing is faster.

　　Naughty Bamboo Shoots
　　The green bamboo all over the mountain is like that. Once they become mothers, they don't care about anything else, so the bamboo shoots are very naughty. One pops out here, and another sticks up there. The commune members who are breaking bamboo shoots climb the bamboo mountains without roads, and throw the broken bamboo shoots into a large cloth bag. No matter how heavy the rain is, they cannot retreat, because if they are even half a day late, the bamboo shoots will be too old to eat and can only be left to grow into bamboo. Experienced commune members say that if the first batch of bamboo shoots that grow out are not broken off, fewer bamboo shoots will grow later. If you break off more, more will grow. Bamboo shoots are that naughty.
　　The famous Tianmu dried bamboo shoots come from this place, at this time. The county party secretary said that this time is a golden age, and we must not relax even one step. If we relax even slightly, the commune will lose a lot of money.

　　Purple Clover Girl, Goodbye Until Next Year!
　　In this mountainous area, people only call purple clover by her nickname – Huacao (花草, literally "flower grass"). This year, when the commune members talk about Huacao, even the eighty-year-old grandfathers feel proud. He said that he had lived for so long and this was the first time he had seen such good Huacao. The township general branch secretary ran to the field, pulled up a plant and measured it with a ruler. Ha! It was three feet long, just enough to harvest nine thousand catties per mu. The foundation for a bumper rice harvest this year has already been laid. What a good fertilizer! When you walk through the Huacao field, you can smell a dizzying fragrance. The purple clover is wearing a green shirt and topped with purple and white little flowers. If these Huacao were planted in a garden, they would not grow so strong. The farmers call her Huacao because they recognize that she is not a pampered flower.
　　The paddy fields are about to be plowed, and the Huacao is also getting old. The little flowers have withered and formed seeds, and the stems are red. If they are not cut, they cannot be used as pig feed. There are few people in the pig raising team, and five people have to cut thirty mu of Huacao. It will take a month to cut it all, how can that work? The Huacao fields must be plowed within ten days, but there are more than one hundred and twenty pigs in the pig raising team, and each pig has to eat three thousand catties of Huacao a year. If you buy other kinds of feed to feed the pigs, it will cost a lot of money. Just when the pig raising team leader was anxiously at a loss, the teacher came to support with more than thirty Young Pioneers. They brought their own sickles and jumped into the field to cut, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, cutting so fast.

　　Purple Clover Girl, goodbye until next year! Next year you will definitely grow more beautiful and stronger, because the best seeds have been selected this year and carefully preserved.

　　山区的春光
    金近
    板栗树变魔术
    清明早已过去了，谷雨也过去了两三天，春天从淡绿色变成深绿色，从暖和转到大热，连迟迟不出叶芽的板栗树，也缀上点点新绿，这些叶芽好像有意逗人似的，只一夜工夫，就变成满树绿叶了，简直像魔术师变魔术一样快。桃树收起了鲜红的花朵，正在想办法结出更大更甜的桃子来，燕子姑娘最关心这件事，常常飞到树顶上去问，不知道桃树是怎样回答的；不过我们可以相信，桃树决不是一个懒汉，也不是一个笨蛋，你只要看她长得多健康，多灵巧，就会知道她是很有把握的。
    秧苗上小学啦
    我第一次看到秧苗的时候，还是钻在谷种子里面的一些白白的小嫩芽，那时候天气很冷，早晨山坡上、草屋上都铺满闪着银光的浓霜，生产队长披着一件厚棉袄，领我到一间小仓库去看早孵的谷种子，他从湿漉漉的谷箩里抓起一把来给我看，多有趣啊！就像刚出世的婴儿。过了几天，谷种子都撒到田里去了。一块块长方形的秧田坂，真像托儿所里的小床，这些谷种子就送到托儿所里去生活了。以后，每天傍晚我就碰到这个生产队长，他背着一支土枪，来来去去的守卫着秧田，不让贪嘴的麻雀来偷吃谷种子。现在秧苗有三寸多长了，它们又得分班啦，种到另外一块田里去，就是说，从托儿所里出来，去上小学。最大的秧苗真的上学啦，它们整整齐齐的排着队，站在水田里，一阵春风轻轻地吹过，它们点点头，知道春风是老师，应该行个礼。可是，还有很多很多要上小学的秧苗都等着呢，生产队长和队员们，要给它们分班，真是够忙啦。
    茶树等不及了
    冬天，茶树没有落过叶子，在山区里，它也是经得起风霜雨雪考验的。不过，冬天毕竟是冬天，茶树长不出嫩叶子来，老是黑簇簇的，等待春天快快到来。茶树一见到春天，高兴透了，马上吐出鲜嫩的叶芽来欢迎，这些小叶子长得真吃力，长了好些日子才露出一点点芽头。清明以后，有几天人们热得穿不住夹衫了，又下了一场大雨，第二天茶树添了很多新叶子，像葵花子那么点大，这些叶子还小着呢。谷雨到了，又下了场大雨，雷声轰隆轰隆的，这是今年第一场大雷雨，第二天早晨，山顶上还在放着白蒙蒙的雾气，溪水哗哗地流得很急，茶树的嫩叶子都长大了，又嫩又壮的新梗子也顶起来了。茶叶要采啦，谁来采呢？村子里的老妈妈们、姑娘们和小学生们，已经做好准备，就要上山来采，他们迟来半天都不行，茶树等得真着急，要是晚采一天，嫩叶子就老了。其实，社里的生产队长心里更焦急，他调动了队里所有的女劳动力，又叫小学生和老师帮忙，还不够，正好县里的中学生要到乡里来帮忙搞生产，社长高兴得跳起来，他在电话里说：“快来吧，最好今天就来！”
    山上的茶树也在准备吐出第二批嫩叶子来，它们还要跟采茶的人比赛呢，到底是采的快还是长的快。
    顽皮的竹笋
    满山的青竹子都是那样，做了妈妈，什么也不管，因此弄得竹笋很顽皮，一忽儿这里窜出一个来，一忽儿那里又顶起一个来了。拗笋的社员们一面爬着没有路的竹山，一面把拗断的竹笋扔进一只大布兜里，不论雨下得多么大，他们不能后退，因为差半天工夫，竹笋就老得不能吃了，只能留下来做竹子。有经验的社员说，要是第一批长出来的竹笋不拗掉，以后长的竹笋就少了，你如果拗得越多，就长得越多，竹笋就是这样顽皮。
    有名的天目笋干就出在这个地方，出在这个时候。县委书记说，这时候是个黄金时代，千万不要放松一步，只要稍稍放松一下，社里就要损失好多钱。
　　紫云英姑娘，明年再见！
    在这个山区里，人们叫紫云英只叫她的小名——花草，今年社员们谈起花草，连八十岁的老公公都觉得骄傲。他说，活了这么大年纪，还是第一次看到这样好的花草。乡总支书记跑到田里去，拔起一株用尺量量，哈！有三尺长，正好每亩收割九千斤，今年水稻大丰收的底子已经打好了，这是多好的肥料！你走过花草田，就能闻到一阵阵醉人的香味，紫云英穿着绿衣衫，顶着一朵朵又紫又白的小花。如果这些花草种在什么花园里，就不会长得这样粗壮。农民所以叫她花草，也就是承认她不是一种娇生惯养的花。
    稻田要耕了，花草也变老了，小花朵谢了已经结成子，梗子红红的，再不割就不能做猪饲料啦。养猪队里人手少，五个人要割三十亩花草，算起来要一个月才能割完，那怎么行呢？花草田在十天里面都得耕掉，可是养猪队里有一百二十多头猪，每头猪一年要吃三千斤花草，要是买别种饲料来喂猪，那又要花好多钱。养猪队长正急得没办法的时候，老师带着三十多个少先队员来支援了，他们自己带来镰刀，跳到田里就割，嗖嗖嗖，割得真快啊。
    紫云英姑娘，明年再见！明年你一定会长得更美丽，更粗壮，因为今年已经选了最好的种子，好好保存起来了。
