Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 29th: The Albanian People's Assembly elections will be held on June 1st. In recent days, the leaders of the Albanian Labor Party and the government, who have been nominated as candidates for deputies, have met with voters and addressed them.

    Labor Party Political Bureau member and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Shehu, said on the 27th when meeting with voters in the 164th electoral district of Tirana that Albania has resolutely embarked on the road of developing socialism, and now Albania is striding forward along this road. For example, Albania's coal production in 1957 was sixty-four times that of 1938, and power generation was thirteen and a half times that of 1938. In 1938, the average resident received less than 27 centimeters of domestically produced cotton cloth, but in 1957, it increased to more than fifteen meters. In agriculture, we have achieved a real revolution. As of early May, we already had 1,912 agricultural producers' cooperatives, which owned 70% of the country's total cultivated land. The living standards of urban and rural workers are constantly improving. Great progress has also been made in education, culture, and health.

    In his speech, Shehu pointed out Albania's achievements in strengthening the country's international position and talked about the current international situation. He emphasized that the recent meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty member states in Moscow once again proved the complete unanimity and indestructible unity of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the Asian people's democracies that support the treaty. This meeting once again showed the world the determination of the countries of the socialist camp to defend peace.

    Shehu said that the Albanian government's foreign policy is based on the indestructible unity and eternal friendship with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. When talking about relations with Yugoslavia, Shehu said that Yugoslav leaders said that Albanian-Yugoslav relations had not been fully improved, and that this was the fault of the Albanian leaders. We fundamentally disagree with this conclusion of the Yugoslav leaders. Our government has made every effort to improve relations with Yugoslavia, and if this relationship has not been fully improved, the responsibility can only be borne by the Yugoslav government, because it has not shown good will in this regard. We will continue to work to improve relations between Albania and Yugoslavia as states, although there are irreconcilable ideological differences between our Labor Party and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. However, this largely depends on the attitude of the Yugoslav government.

    Shehu then criticized modern revisionism. He said that modern revisionism is trying to play the role of a Trojan horse, trying to undermine the unity of the international workers' movement. We are unwilling to interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia and the League of Communists. However, when we see that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is trying to undermine the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, we cannot ignore it.

    At the recently held Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslav leaders themselves took off their masks and revealed the true face of thorough revisionists towards all the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. The arguments of the Yugoslav Communist program clearly show this. The arguments of this program are nothing more than a patchwork and pile-up of all anti-Marxist, revisionist, and Trotskyist decadent arguments. And this revisionist program comes from a ruling party. Communist and workers' parties around the world have expressed opposition to this program, and they condemn these revisionist, anti-Marxist-Leninist arguments.

    Shehu finally said that our party has decided to do everything possible to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, just as it is determined to defend the independence of the motherland. We will never allow revisionist and anti-Marxist views to grow in our country.

    Albanian Labor Party Political Bureau member and Secretary of the Secretariat, H. Cabo, said in a meeting with voters in the Valona district that modern revisionism is the most suitable weapon for imperialism to use to deceive the working people, oppose the unity of the socialist camp, split communist and workers' parties, and attack the Soviet Union, and the Yugoslav Communist leaders are playing this role today. The Yugoslav Communist program and the speeches of Tito, Kardelj, and Rankovic at the Yugoslav Communist Congress are thoroughly filled with anti-Marxist revisionist hostile sentiments. This sentiment is against the Soviet Union and socialist countries, against the socialist camp, and splits the ranks of the international communist and workers' movement, which is beneficial to imperialism. It is not the first time that Yugoslav revisionist leaders have publicly attacked the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, as well as communist and workers' parties.

    Cabo said that everyone knows how the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and its leaders treated the serious mistakes they committed in deviating from the principles of Marxism-Leninism after the Information Bureau made correct criticisms of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in 1948. It is no accident that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia fell into the mire of bourgeois nationalism, which shows how loyal the Yugoslav leaders are to the revisionist line. The imperialist bloc has always welcomed the Yugoslav leaders' attacks on the Soviet Union and the socialist camp again and again. Who could better serve the purposes of imperialism than revisionists who, under the cover of masks, call themselves defenders of Marxism-Leninism? The propaganda of imperialism against the Soviet Union and socialist countries has become disgusting and despised, and its true colors have long been exposed. The spread of revisionist ideas is more suitable for the time when imperialism is launching attacks.

    Cabo pointed out that the Yugoslav revisionist leaders defend the military blocs of imperialist organizations, but attack the Soviet Union's peace policies. They oppose strengthening cooperation with socialist countries, believing that socialist construction can be carried out without such cooperation and with the help of imperialism. The Yugoslav revisionist leaders distort and slander the relations between socialist countries. They demand the weakening of the dictatorship of the proletariat, clearing the way for the enemies of socialism and imperialists to achieve their goals. They deny class struggle and proletarian revolution, and replace class struggle and proletarian revolution with the revisionist theory that capitalism can grow into socialism. The Yugoslav revisionist leaders also demand the reduction of the role of the Communist Party as the organizer and leader of the working people in their struggle for the victory of communism.

    Cabo said that it is no accident that American imperialism generously gives Yugoslavia hundreds of millions of dollars in loans. Is imperialism interested in socialist construction? No, they do this because the Yugoslav leaders are taking the revisionist road. Their practice of promoting revisionism as creative Marxism-Leninism directly serves American imperialism and is harmful to socialism and the international communist movement.

    Cabo said that, however, the attempts of the revisionists will never be realized. Our camp is strong and unbreakable. The ranks of communist and workers' parties are growing, the iron-like unity and eternal friendship between the people of socialist countries centered on the Soviet Union, the Leninist peace policy followed by the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, and the great strength of our camp, these are the guarantees of our eternal victory.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 29th: The fourth session of the Albanian People's Assembly elections will be held on June 1st. In recent days, the People's Assembly candidates have met with voters. From May 10th to May 28th, one hundred and eighty-six of the one hundred and eighty-eight candidates have met with voters. The 29th was the last day for candidates to meet with voters.

    People's Assembly Presidium Chairman Leshi, Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu, Labor Party Political Bureau member and Secretariat Secretary Cabo and other leaders attended the voters' meetings in various electoral districts and delivered speeches.

    谢胡和卡博会见选民时谈话
    指斥南共纲领有利于帝国主义
    为西方军事集团辩护攻击苏联和平政策
    新华社地拉那29日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民议会选举将在6月
  1日举行。最近几天来，被提名为议员候选人的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府领导人分别和选民见了面，并且向他们讲了话。
    劳动党政治局委员、部长会议主席谢胡27日在会见地拉那第一百六十四号选区的选民时说，阿尔巴尼亚已经坚决地走上了发展社会主义的道路，现在阿尔巴尼亚正沿着这条道路大步前进。举例来说，1957年阿尔巴尼亚的煤产量等于1938年的六十四倍，发电量等于1938年的十三倍半。1938年国内生产的棉布平均每个居民只得到不到二公寸七公分，而在1957年时，就增加到十五公尺以上。在农业方面，我们已经实现了真正的革命。在5月初，我们已经有一千九百一十二个农业生产合作社，它们拥有的耕地占全国耕地总面积的70％。城乡劳动者的生活水平都在不断提高。在教育、文化和卫生方面，也取得了巨大的进展。
    谢胡在讲话中指出了阿尔巴尼亚在加强国家的国际地位方面所取得的成就，并且谈到了目前的国际形势。他强调指出，最近在莫斯科召开的华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议再一次证明华沙条约缔约国和支持这个条约的亚洲人民民主国家的完全一致和不可摧毁的团结。这次会议再一次向全世界表明社会主义阵营各国保卫和平的决心。
    谢胡说，阿尔巴尼亚政府的对外政策，是以同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的不可摧毁的团结和永恒友谊为基础的。谢胡在谈到同南斯拉夫的关系时说，南斯拉夫领导人说，阿南关系还没有得到充分改善，这是阿尔巴尼亚领导人的过错。我们根本不同意南斯拉夫领导人的这种结论。我们政府已作了一切努力来改善同南斯拉夫的关系，如果说这种关系没有得到充分改善，责任只能由南斯拉夫政府来负，因为它在这方面没有表现出良好意愿。我们今后仍将继续努力改善同南斯拉夫的国家与国家之间的关系，尽管我们劳动党同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟之间存在着不可调和的极大的思想分歧。但是，这在很大程度上要取决于南斯拉夫政府的态度。
    谢胡接着批判了现代修正主义。他说，现代修正主义正在试图起一种特洛伊木马的作用，试图破坏国际工人运动的团结。我们不愿意过问南斯拉夫和南共的内部事务。然而，当我们看见南共纲领草案试图破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结时，我们就不能置之不理。
    在不久前举行的南共第七次代表大会上，南斯拉夫领导人自己拿下了假面具，显露出对待马克思列宁主义一切根本原则的彻头彻尾的修正主义者的真面
  目。南共纲领的论点，非常明显地表明了这一点。这个纲领的论点不是别的，只是一切反马克思主义的、修正主义的和托洛茨基主义的腐朽论调的拼凑和堆砌。而这个修正主义纲领却出自一个执政党之手。全世界各国共产党和工人党都表示反对这个纲领，它们谴责这些修正主义的、反马克思列宁主义的论点。
    谢胡最后说，我们党决定竭尽全力捍卫马克思列宁主义的原则，正如它决心保卫祖国的独立一样。我们决不容许修正主义和反马克思的观点在我国滋长。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党政治局委员、书记处书记希·卡博在同发罗那区选民会见时说，现代修正主义是帝国主义用以欺骗劳动人民反对社会主义阵营的团结、分裂共产党和工人党和攻击苏联的最合适的武器，而南共领导者今天正充当着这一角色。南共纲领和铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇在南共代表大会上的发言，是彻头彻尾贯穿着反马克思主义的修正主义敌对情绪，这种情绪是反对苏联和各社会主义国家，反对社会主义阵营和分裂国际共产主义和工人运动的队伍，是有利于帝国主义的。南斯拉夫修正主义者不是第一次公开来攻击苏联和社会主义阵营以及共产党和工人党的。
    卡博说，大家知道，情报局1948年对南共作了正确批评以后，南共和南共领导人对自己所犯的脱离马克思列宁主义原则的严重错误是怎样对待的。南共陷入了资产阶级民族主义的泥坑，这不是偶然的，这说明南斯拉夫领导者多么地忠实于修正主义的路线。帝国主义集团任何时候都欢欣鼓舞地欢迎南斯拉夫领导者一次又一次地向苏联和社会主义阵营各国发动的进攻，谁会比修正主义者在假面具的掩护下自称为马克思列宁主义的保卫者更好地为帝国主义的目的服务呢？帝国主义反对苏联和社会主义各国的宣传已变得令人厌恶和鄙弃，它的真面目早就暴露了。修正主义思想的传播是更好地适合于帝国主义进行攻击的时机。
    卡博指出，南斯拉夫修正主义领导者为帝国主义组织军事集团辩护，然而却攻击苏联的和平政策。他们反对同社会主义国家加强合作，认为没有这样的合作、依靠帝国主义的帮助也可以进行社会主义的建设。南斯拉夫修正主义领导人歪曲、诽谤社会主义国家之间的关系。他们要求削弱无产阶级专政，为社会主义的敌人和帝国主义者达到他们的目的扫清道路。他们否认阶级斗争和无产阶级革命，而以资本主义可以长入社会主义的修正主义理论来代替阶级斗争和无产阶级革命。南斯拉夫修正主义领导人还要求降低作为劳动人民争取共产主义胜利的组织者和领导者的共产党作用。
    卡博说，美帝国主义慷慨地给予南斯拉夫数亿美元的贷款不是偶然的。难道帝国主义对社会主义建设有兴趣吗？不，他们所以这样，是因为南斯拉夫领导走的是修正主义的道路。他们所进行的把修正主义宣传为创造性的马克思列宁主义的做法是直接服务于美帝国主义而有害于社会主义和国际共产主义运动的。
    卡博说，但是，修正主义者的企图永远也不会实现。我们的阵营是强大的和牢不可破的。共产党、工人党的队伍日益壮大，以苏联为中心的社会主义各国人民间的钢铁般的团结和永恒的友谊，苏联和社会主义阵营各国所遵循的列宁主义的和平政策和我们阵营的巨大力量，这些都是我们永远胜利的保证。
    据新华社地拉那29日电　阿尔巴尼亚第四届人民议会选举将在6月1日举行。连日来，人民议会候选人分别和选民会见。自5月10日起到5月28日止，在一百八十八个候选人中已经有一百八十六个候选人和选民见了面。29日是候选人和选民会见的最后一天。
    人民议会主席团主席列希、部长会议主席谢胡、劳动党政治局委员、书记处书记卡博等领导人分别出席了各选区的选民会见大会并且发表了演说。
