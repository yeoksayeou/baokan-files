　　The Worker Elder Brothers are Really Good
　　On April 3rd, a water pump in the Dongzhaizi Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wu'an County, Hebei Province, stopped working. The wheat seedlings in the fields urgently needed watering, but no one in the cooperative knew how to repair it. Just as the members were getting anxious, comrades Gao Lin and An Runsheng, two workers from the county repair factory who had come to the countryside, arrived at Dongzhaizi Village. Ignoring their fatigue, they immediately rushed to the fields to repair the machine. However, the water pump was cracked and could not be repaired even in Wu'an city. Comrade Gao Lin, undeterred by the hardship, immediately rode his bicycle with a water pump weighing over fifty pounds for sixty *li* to Handan city and had it welded in less than a day.
　　When the water pump started working again and the silvery water flowed into the wheat fields, the cooperative members said happily, "With the help of the worker elder brothers, a good harvest is guaranteed."

　　工人老大哥真好
    4月3日，河北省武安县东寨子村农业社有一台水泵不能抽水了。地里的麦苗急需浇水，社里又没有人会修理。社员们正在着急的时候，从县里修配厂下乡来的高林及安润生两位工人同志来到了东寨子村，他们顾不得疲劳，马上跑到地里去修理机器。可是，水泵裂了，到武安城去也不能修理，高林同志就不辞辛苦，立刻骑上自行车带着一个五十多斤重的水泵一口气跑了六十里路赶到邯郸市，不到一天功夫就把水泵焊好了。
    当水泵重新开动起来、银白色的水流进麦田里的时候，社员们高兴地说：“有工人老大哥的帮助，丰收就有了保障。”
