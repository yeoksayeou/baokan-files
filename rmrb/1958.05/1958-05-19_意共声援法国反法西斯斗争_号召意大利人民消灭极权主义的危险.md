Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 17th: The leadership of the Italian Communist Party issued a statement regarding the serious situation in France and Algeria. The Italian Communist Party expresses fraternal solidarity with the French working class, the French people, and the French Communist Party, who are waging a resolute struggle to save the republican government and the democratic system.

The statement pointed out that those who have been obstructing for many years, and continue to obstruct in this critical moment, the formation of an alliance between democratic republicans and left-wing forces should be held responsible for the current situation in France. Because of these people's extreme discrimination against the Communist Party and their stubborn obstruction of the formation of an alliance of left-wing forces in order to continue the criminal war against the Algerian people, a small group of generals has been able to rebel and launch a fascist adventure.

The statement said that the leadership of the Italian Communist Party would like to take the opportunity of the French events to once again warmly call on the working class, the working people, and all forces in Italy concerned with combating reactionary adventures to unite. In France, the attack on the democratic system is led by de Gaulle and the colonialist generals. In Italy, the leaders of the clergy are doing this. Although the people and methods are different, the goal is the same: to establish a totalitarian system that eliminates freedom and other political forces, and forcibly implements war and reactionary policies.

The leadership of the Italian Communist Party calls on the working class, peasants, and middle-class residents to work more forcefully for the victory of a policy of unity, which will help to eliminate the danger of totalitarianism in Italy. The statement pointed out that the facts have proven that Communists and Socialists must act in unison to defeat class enemies and enemies of democracy.

The statement emphasized an analysis of the differences in strength and policies between the capitalist camp and the socialist camp. It said that the launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite shows that the "policy of strength" aimed at resisting the peaceful advance of socialism and the communist movement—the powerful vanguard of mankind's struggle for progress—is not only sinful but also out of step with the times. History and reason are both in favor of the socialist world.

The statement concluded by calling on the Italian people to vote for the Communist Party in the parliamentary elections on May 25, because the Communist Party is the creator of the new world, the main fortress in the struggle against the threat of reactionaries, and the standard-bearer and defender of the great unity of the working class, democratic forces, and the people.

　　意共声援法国反法西斯斗争
　　号召意大利人民消灭极权主义的危险
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社罗马17日讯：意大利共产党领导机构就法国和阿尔及利亚的严重局势发表声明。意大利共产党向正在为拯救共和政体和民主制度而进行着坚决斗争的法国工人阶级、法国人民和法国共产党表示兄弟般的声援。
    声明指出，多年来一直阻挠、而且在今天这种严重关头仍然继续阻挠民主共和人士同左翼力量结成联盟的人，应该对法国的当前局势负责。由于这些人对共产党极端歧视、顽固阻挠左翼力量结成联盟，以便继续进行反对阿尔及利亚人民的罪恶战争，使得一小撮将军有可能叛变和发动法西斯冒险。
    声明说，意大利共产党领导机构愿借这次法国事件的机会再一次热烈号召工人阶级、劳动人民和一切关心在意大利打击反动冒险的力量团结起来。在法国，对民主制度的进攻是由戴高乐和殖民主义的将军们领导的。在意大利，这样做的是教权派的首领们。尽管人和方法不同，但目的是一样的，这就是：建立一个消灭自由和其他政治力量、强制执行战争和反动政策的极权制度。
    意大利共产党领导机构号召工人阶级、农民和中层居民更有力地争取团结政策的胜利，这种政策将有助于在意大利消灭极权主义的危险。声明指出，事实证明共产党人和社会党人必须一致行动才能战胜阶级敌人和民主的敌人。
    声明着重分析了资本主义阵营和社会主义阵营的力量和政策的不同。它说，苏联第三个卫星的发射表明，“实力地位政策”企图抵挡社会主义的和平前进，抵挡共产主义运动——人类争取进步的强大先锋队，不仅是有罪的，而且是不合时代的。历史和理性、都是于社会主义世界有利的。
    声明最后号召意大利人民在5月25日的议会选举中投票选举共产党，因为共产党是新世界的缔造者，是反对反动派威胁的斗争中的主要堡垒，又是工人阶级、民主力量和人民的大团结的旗手和捍卫者。
