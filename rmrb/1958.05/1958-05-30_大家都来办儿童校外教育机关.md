Everyone Should Run Children's Extracurricular Education Institutions
\t*People's Daily* Commentator

Extracurricular education is an important component of children's education. In recent years, children's extracurricular education has attracted the attention of all sectors of society, and caring for and educating children has become a common practice in the new society. However, in many places, due to the scarcity of extracurricular activity venues, the extracurricular lives of the majority of children are still poor and monotonous. How to enrich their after-school lives and strengthen extracurricular education work is still a matter worthy of attention.

One of the important issues in children's extracurricular education is solving the problem of activity venues. There are two ways to solve this problem. One is to rely on the masses, mobilize the masses to establish more simple and small-scale children's extracurricular activity venues, and first meet the urgent needs of the majority of children for after-school cultural life. By doing so, there will be more children's extracurricular activity venues, children's after-school lives will be enriched, and children will basically be attracted to legitimate cultural, sports, and other activities, thereby actively resisting the influence of certain negative factors on children. The residents of Hangzhou organizing "Youth Clubs" is a good example. The other way is to blindly pursue "regularization," believing that only children's palaces and children's homes can be called children's extracurricular education institutions. To run children's extracurricular education institutions, one must have complete equipment, cadres, and funding. The result of doing so is that the development of extracurricular education institutions is very slow. In many small and medium-sized cities, there is still not even one children's activity venue, and many children have nowhere to go for extracurricular activities. Their abundant energy is not used in proper places, and some children even pick up bad habits.

Children's extracurricular education is the common cause of every parent, school, and all sectors of society, and everyone is responsible. Solving the problem of extracurricular activity venues for children should also be a collective effort, with everyone participating. Relying solely on the government or one sector is not enough. In recent years, the People's Government, various mass organizations, factories, mines, and enterprises have established some children's extracurricular education institutions, but they are mostly concentrated in large and medium-sized cities, and they accommodate very few people. Children's extracurricular education institutions such as children's palaces and children's homes across the country can only absorb more than 200,000 people to participate in activities every day, while China has more than 100 million children, of which elementary school students alone number more than 63 million. Obviously, relying solely on running formal, large-scale children's extracurricular education institutions cannot meet the extracurricular activity requirements of the majority of children. There must also be some auxiliary methods, which is to, according to the spirit of diligence and thrift in running all undertakings, mobilize the masses and social organizations to run more simple, economical, and practical children's extracurricular education institutions such as "Youth Clubs." This is the correct way to solve the problem of children's extracurricular activity venues and rapidly popularize the extracurricular education network.

Along with the idea of regularization comes a mystical view of extracurricular education institutions, because they must be run "formally," so it is believed that they cannot be run. In fact, the task of extracurricular education institutions is to conduct communist education for children through various activities that children love and that are of educational significance, help them consolidate and expand classroom knowledge, enrich their cultural lives, and develop their interests and talents. Among the parents of children, there is no shortage of talent. Those with cultural knowledge can tutor children in reading, those who know how to sing and dance can teach children to sing and dance, those who can paint can teach children to paint, and those who understand certain production knowledge and have certain production skills, such as handicrafts, woodworking, metalworking, planting, and raising livestock, can impart this knowledge and skills to children and carry out activities in this regard. In short, whatever activities that are of educational significance to children, do whatever you can. There is nothing mysterious about this. As long as one is good at mobilizing and organizing parents and the masses, such institutions can be run everywhere.

In order to create a good extracurricular education environment for children, we hope that other cities will also, like Hangzhou, establish a variety of children's extracurricular education institutions such as "Youth Clubs," "Young Pioneers Homes," and "Children's Reading Rooms" in various residential areas, so that the majority of children can grow up healthily under the care of all sectors of society.

    大家都来办儿童校外教育机关
    本报评论员
    校外教育，是儿童教育的一个重要组成部分。近几年来，儿童校外教育已经引起社会各方面的注意，爱护和教育儿童已成为新社会的风尚。但是，现在许多地方由于校外活动场所太少，广大儿童的校外生活还很贫乏单调，如何丰富他们的课外生活，加强校外教育工作，仍然是值得注意的一件事情。
    儿童校外教育工作的重要问题之一是解决活动场地。解决这个问题有两种方法，一种是依靠群众、发动群众多办简单的、小型的儿童校外活动场所，首先满足广大少年儿童的课外文化生活的迫切需要。这样做，儿童校外活动场所就多起来了，儿童的课余生活丰富了，孩子们基本上被吸引到正当的文化、体育等活动中来，从积极方面抵制某些不良因素对少年儿童的影响。杭州市居民自办“少年俱乐部”就是一个很好的例子。另一种是盲目追求“正规化”，认为只有少年宫、少年之家才称得上儿童校外教育机关。要办儿童校外教育机关就一定要有完整的设备，要有干部和经费。这样做的结果是：校外教育机关发展很迟缓，现在有不少中小城市迄今连一个儿童活动场所也没有，许多少年儿童在校外没地方活动，他们充沛的精神没用到正当的地方去，有的儿童甚至沾染了坏的习气。
    儿童的校外教育，是每个父母、学校和社会各方面共同的事业，人人有责；解决少年儿童的校外活动场所也应当是群策群力，大家来办。单靠政府或某一个方面的力量是不行的。最近几年，人民政府、各群众团体、厂矿企业等举办了一些儿童校外教育机关，但大都集中在大中城市，而且容纳的人数很少。全国的少年宫、少年之家等儿童校外教育机关每天只能吸收二十多万人参加活动，而我国的少年儿童却有一亿以上，其中仅小学在校学生即有六千三百多万。显然，单靠办正规的大型的儿童校外教育机关是不可能满足广大儿童校外活动要求的，还必须有一些辅助的办法，就是根据勤俭办一切事业的精神，发动群众、社会团体多办简易、经济、实用的“少年俱乐部”之类的儿童校外教育机关，这是解决儿童校外活动场所，迅速普及校外教育网的正确途径。
    随着正规化思想而来的是对于校外教育机关的一种神秘观点，因为必须办得“正规”，因此就认为办不了。其实，校外教育机关的任务，就是通过各种儿童所喜爱的并有教育意义的活动，对少年儿童进行共产主义教育，帮助他们巩固和扩大课堂知识，丰富他们的文化生活，发展他们的兴趣和才能。在儿童的家长中是不乏人才的，有文化知识的就辅导孩子阅读，会歌舞的就教孩子们歌舞，会画的就教孩子们画，懂某种生产知识和有某种生产技能的，例如手工、木工、金工、种植、饲养等等，可以传授给孩子们这方面的知识和技能，开展这方面的活动。总之，凡对儿童有教育意义的活动，能搞什么，就搞什么。这里面并没有什么神秘。只要善于发动和组织家长群众，这样的机关处处可以办。
    为了给少年儿童创设一个良好校外教育环境，我们希望其他城市也像杭州一样，在各居民区普遍建立“少年俱乐部”、“中小队之家”、“儿童阅览室”等多种多样的儿童校外教育机关，使广大少年儿童在社会各方面的关怀下健康地成长起来。
