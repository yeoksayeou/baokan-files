    Improved Mail Delivery Work
    The criticisms raised by the People's Daily on March 25th, page 4, regarding the delivery of letters and newspapers to cadres who have been sent to lower levels are very correct to our bureau. Our bureau has readjusted and increased rural postal routes starting from March 1st. The problem of delivering letters and newspapers to cadres sent to lower levels has been resolved.

专栏：批评建议的反应

    改进了投寄工作
    人民日报3月25日第四版关于下放干部的信、报投寄问题，对我局提出的批评意见是很正确的。我局已自3月1日起重新调整增加了乡邮路线。下放干部的信、报投寄问题，已经解决。
