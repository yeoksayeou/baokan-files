Xinhua News Agency, May 14th. Western news agencies reveal that the United States is attempting to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs under the pretext of so-called "foreign interference in Lebanon."

　　U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, on May 12th, used his usual trick of slandering the "anti-American sentiment in Lebanon as being stirred up by aspects we can imagine." Following this, Lebanese President Chamoun also said on May 13th that his country was "the target of attacks from abroad." Chamoun held talks with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France to Lebanon on that day. United Press International said that "Chamoun's actions may be to prepare for requesting military assistance or requesting assistance from the United Nations."

　　Lebanon's pro-Western government's Foreign Minister Malik also stated at a press conference on May 13th that Lebanon was considering whether to request assistance from the West or from the United Nations.

　　A United Press International dispatch from Washington on May 13th said: "U.S. officials suggested today that the Lebanese crisis should be submitted to the United Nations if it worsens." These officials believe that this is the "natural path" for Lebanon to follow, and that it would conform to the "standard of American policy," which is to first use the United Nations to intervene, and then take so-called "special measures" outside the United Nations. United Press International admitted that one of the so-called "special measures" mentioned here is invoking the "Eisenhower Doctrine," which has been universally condemned by the people of the Middle East. A United Press International dispatch from London on the same day revealed that the United States is brewing military intervention in Lebanon. The message said that two destroyers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet are patrolling near Lebanon. Prior to this, a U.S. Navy spokesman announced on May 12th that the Sixth Fleet was "prepared to go wherever it may be ordered to protect American lives." At the same time, a British Foreign Office spokesman also said on May 13th that the British government expressed "concern" about "any attempt by outside forces to subvert and overthrow the Lebanese government." He said that the British government had discussed the situation in Lebanon with "its friends."

　　French Embassy officials in the United States, Lucet, visited the State Department on May 13th to consult with the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Middle Eastern Affairs on the situation in Lebanon.

　　美国正在制造口实
    企图干涉黎巴嫩内政
    新华社14日讯　据西方通讯社透露，美国正在企图以所谓“外国干涉黎巴嫩”为口实来干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    美国国务卿杜勒斯在12日以他惯用的技俩诬蔑黎巴嫩的“反美情绪是由我们可以想像到的方面煽起的”。接着，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙在13日也说，他的国家是“来自国外的攻击的目标”。夏蒙在这一天同美、英、法三国驻黎巴嫩的大使举行了会谈。合众社说，“夏蒙的行动可能是为了要求提供军事援助或者要求联合国给予帮助作好准备”。
    黎巴嫩亲西方政府的外交部长马利克在13日举行的记者招待会上也表示，黎巴嫩正在考虑是要求西方还是要求联合国帮助的问题。
    合众社13日发自华盛顿的一条消息说：“美国官员今天建议，黎巴嫩危机如果恶化，就应该提交联合国”。这些官员认为，这是黎巴嫩应该遵循的“自然途径”，而且这将符合“美国政策的标准”，这就是：先利用联合国出面，然后再采取联合国以外的所谓“特别措施”。合众社承认，这里提到的所谓“特别措施”之一就是援引受到中东人民普遍谴责的“艾森豪威尔主义”。合众社同一天从伦敦发出的消息中透露美国正在酝酿对黎巴嫩进行军事干涉。消息说，美国第六舰队的两艘驱逐舰正在黎巴嫩附近巡逻。在这以前，美国海军发言人曾经在12日宣布，第六舰队“准备到它可能奉命去的任何地方去保护美国人的生命”。和这同时，英国外交部发言人也在13日说，英国政府“对外界任何想颠覆和推翻黎巴嫩政府的企图”表示“关切”。他说，英国政府同“它的朋友们”曾经讨论了黎巴嫩的局势。
    法国驻美国大使馆官员吕赛在13日访问了国务院，同美国负责中东事务的助理国务卿就黎巴嫩局势进行了磋商。
