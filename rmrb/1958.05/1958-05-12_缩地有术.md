　　The Art of Shrinking Distances
　　Liu Feng
    I live in the western suburbs of Beijing. Before, I had to spend nearly an hour commuting to work in the city every day, waiting for buses and changing buses, and I was often late for work. During the rectification campaign, the big-character posters criticized the phenomena of being late and leaving early. I made up my mind to set the alarm clock early, get up early, and leave early, and indeed, I was no longer late.
    Recently, my alarm clock still rings at the old time, and I still get up at the same time, but I arrive even earlier. It often feels like I arrive a quarter of an hour before work starts, as if the place where I live and my workplace are getting closer and closer, and the buses also seem to be much less crowded. I was puzzled and asked the conductor, only to find out that this bus route has sped up, changing from the original 33 minutes for the entire journey to 30 minutes. The distance between the two bus stops where I transfer has also been adjusted to be closer together. After getting off one bus, I can immediately catch another bus after walking a few steps, unlike before when I had to run a long distance. These new measures and changes are truly effective in shrinking distances, greatly saving the time of many passengers.
    The innovative measures are not just limited to this. This bus route has also broken the old rule of "front door exit, back door entrance" for double-door buses, achieving simultaneous exit and entrance at both front and back doors. As a result, passengers getting off at the back no longer have to squeeze and push forward through the crowded carriage. The speed of getting off the bus has greatly increased, and people boarding the bus enter simultaneously from both doors, turning the previous situation of the front being loose and the back being crowded into a situation where the entire bus is fully loaded. Because the carriage is truly full, people waiting for the bus below no longer complain that the passengers on the bus lack public morality and cannot consider those waiting for the bus. The ticket seller's strained shouts of "Please move forward, passengers!" and "Please let the comrades in the middle make way!" are no longer heard. The bus is indeed full, runs quickly, and achieves more, faster, better, and more economical results, making everyone satisfied.
    Many of our rules and regulations are good, but there are also some that have become obstacles to further improving the enthusiasm of the masses and developing productivity. Hasn't the increase in the speed of buses not affected the safety of the journey? Hasn't the implementation of simultaneous exits and entrances at the front and back doors not caused chaos in the order of getting on and off the bus? These new phenomena are all achieved by concentrating the wisdom of the broad masses and breaking through conservative conventions!
    If public buses are like this, why aren't other things also like this? Hasn't the Shanghai to Nanjing express train been shortened from five hours and two minutes to three hours and fifty-two minutes? Only by breaking through conservatism can we leap forward. In order to leap forward, we must oppose conservatism. Let us board these leaping vehicles and forge ahead courageously!

　　缩地有术
　　柳风
    我住在北京西郊，以前每天进城上班，等车、换车，路上总要用近一个钟头的时间，上班常是迟到。整风了，大字报上对迟到早退现象进行了批评，我下了决心，每天开好了闹钟，早早起床，早早动身，果然不再迟到。
    最近我的闹钟还是在老钟点响，我也还是在这时候起身，可是到的却更早了，往往在上班前一刻钟就到了，好像我住的地方和办公处所越来越近似的，公共汽车里也好像松动了许多。我很纳闷，问了一下售票员，才知道这一路车子已加快了速度，由原来全程走三十三分钟，改到三十分钟；换车的两路汽车站的距离也调整得紧挨着了，下了这部车以后，走不几步就可马上搭上另一路车，不像从前要跑好远的一大段路了。这些新的措施，这些改变，真是缩地有方，大大的节省了许多乘客的时间。
    革新的措施还不仅仅是这点，这一路公共汽车还打破了双门汽车“前门下，后门上”的老章程，做到前后门同时下同时上。这样一来，后面的乘客要下车，再也用不着在水泄不通的车厢里，向前硬挤硬冲了，下车的速度大大加快，上车的人两路并进，双门齐入，前松后挤的情况，一变而为全车都装得满满的了。由于车厢真正装满了，下面等车的人再也不埋怨车上的乘客没有公共道德、不能为等车的人设想了。售票员力竭声嘶喊：“请乘客往前走！”“请中间的同志让一让！”的叫唤声再也听不到了。车子的确是装得满满，走得快快，做到了多快好省，大家满意。
    我们有很多的章程条例都是好的，但也有一部分章程条例，已经成为进一步提高群众积极性和发展生产力的障碍。公共汽车行车速度提高，不是并没有影响到行车的安全吗？实行了前后门同下同上不是也并没有造成上下车秩序的紊乱吗？这些新的气象都是在集中广大群众的智慧，冲破了保守的陈规，才实现的呵！
    公共汽车如此，其他的事又何尝不是这样，上海到南京的旅客特别快车，不是已经由五小时零二分，缩短到三小时五十二分吗？只有突破了保守才能跃进，为了跃进必须反对保守。让我们跨上这些飞跃的车辆，奋勇前进吧！
