    The Meeting Endorsed the Moscow Declaration and Criticized the Representative of Modern Revisionism – The Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia
    The National Agricultural Development Program Was Basically Adopted, Mobilizing the Whole Party and the Entire People to Realize This Program Ahead of Schedule

Xinhua News Agency, May 24th: The Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China closed on the afternoon of May 23rd.

At yesterday afternoon's meeting, the Resolution on the Work Report of the Central Committee was adopted, the Resolution on the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties was adopted, the National Agricultural Development Program (Second Revised Draft) was adopted, and twenty-five comrades were elected as alternate members of the Central Committee.

This meeting reflected the victory of the Rectification Movement and the Anti-Rightist Struggle, and the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. This meeting itself was a rectification meeting, a meeting against international revisionism, against rightist elements, localist elements, and nationalist elements who had infiltrated the Party, and a Great Leap Forward meeting.

This meeting began on the afternoon of May 5th. At the meeting, Comrade Liu Shaoqi delivered a work report on the Central Committee, Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered a report on the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, and Comrade Tan Zhenlin gave an explanation of the Agricultural Development Program (Second Revised Draft). During the meeting, Comrade Mao Zedong spoke at the meeting.

In his report, Comrade Liu Shaoqi elaborated on the current situation, the Party's general line for socialist construction, and future tasks.

In his report, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said that in the year or so between the First Session and the Second Session of this Congress, the Party has correctly implemented and developed the guidelines and policies determined by the First Session, and has achieved great achievements in all aspects of work.

In the first part of his report, Comrade Liu Shaoqi analyzed the current international and domestic situations, and summarized the achievements of the Rectification Movement and the high tide of industrial and agricultural production and construction in the first four months of this year. He said that in our socialist construction, we are experiencing the great era of "one day equals twenty years" predicted by Marx.

The second part of Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report explained in detail the Party's general line for socialist construction. He said that the basic points of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results are: to mobilize all positive factors and correctly handle contradictions among the people; to consolidate and develop socialist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership, to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the international solidarity of the proletariat; while continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, to gradually realize the technological revolution and the cultural revolution; under the condition of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, industry, and agriculture should be developed simultaneously; under the conditions of centralized leadership, overall planning, division of labour and cooperation, central industry and local industry should be developed simultaneously, large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises should be developed simultaneously; all these are aimed at building our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture as soon as possible.

In this part of his report, he put forward the main tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution, criticized the opposing views on the general line of socialist construction, and demonstrated the necessity of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously, developing central industry and local industry simultaneously, and developing large, medium, and small enterprises simultaneously. He pointed out: The result of implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction will greatly develop our country's social productive forces, greatly increase our country's labour productivity, enable our country's industry to catch up with and surpass Britain in the output of major industrial products within fifteen years or even less; enable our country's agriculture to rapidly surpass capitalist countries on the basis of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule; and enable our country's science and technology to catch up with the most advanced level in the world as soon as possible on the basis of realizing the twelve-year scientific development plan.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi's report then discussed the Party's tasks in the Rectification Movement, the tasks of improving national work, and the tasks of strengthening the Party's leadership. Regarding the Party's leadership, he emphasized the necessity of strengthening ideological and political work, pointing out the necessity of opposing dogmatism and empiricism, applying materialism and dialectics to practical work, breaking superstitions, promoting innovation and creation, advocating charging for the truth, and establishing advanced and revolutionary banners. Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: By strengthening the unity of more than 600 million people domestically, and strengthening the unity with the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union internationally, our cause will surely be victorious.

In his report on the Moscow Meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: The two declarations of the Moscow Meeting have great historical significance. The declaration of the twelve Communist Parties is actually a program for the international communist movement for a long period to come, and it makes an accurate analysis of the current situation and a series of fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. The two declarations have been approved by all communist parties in the world except the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and have been welcomed and supported by the broad masses of the world.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping elaborated on the spirit of the Moscow Declaration from the aspects of the international situation, the interrelationship between the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism and the national characteristics of various countries, ideological work and the struggle against revisionism, and strengthening the unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement, and at the same time criticized the various fallacies of modern revisionism represented by the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is an anti-Marxist-Leninist and thoroughly revisionist program, and is the most concentrated representative of neo-Bernsteinism. The essence of this program lies in uglifying socialism and beautifying capitalism, uglifying the dictatorship of the proletariat and beautifying the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, uglifying the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and beautifying the imperialist camp headed by the United States, opposing the proletariat's struggle against the capitalist and imperialist camp under the leadership of the Communist Party, and abandoning the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: We must strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, enhance the unity with fraternal parties in all countries of the world, and resolutely fight against modern revisionism that has emerged in the international communist movement. This is our international obligation. We believe that along the direction pointed out by the Moscow Declaration, the international communist movement will enter a new period of upsurge.

In his explanation of the National Agricultural Development Program (Second Revised Draft), Comrade Tan Zhenlin briefly described the saddle-shaped development process from high to low and then from low to high in agricultural production and construction during the three winter-spring periods from the winter of 1955 to the spring of 1958, thereby proving the necessity of adhering to the principle of greater, faster, better, and more economical results and the error of so-called "anti-adventurism," and proving the great role of the National Agricultural Development Program. When discussing the current situation of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, he said that according to the plans of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, hundreds of counties and cities across the country will reach or exceed the targets of 400, 500, 800 jin of grain per mu or 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu this year respectively. Now, except for a few units, the production increase targets proposed by various places are generally positive. The current problem lies in firmly grasping specific measures, and we must pay attention to preventing superficiality without depth, roughness without refinement, and ostentation without substance, so as not to fail to meet the target requirements after autumn. He also pointed out: In developing agricultural production, we must consider the possibility of certain unfavorable objective factors appearing, such as the occurrence of uncontrollable natural disasters, or the failure of certain measures due to the lack of objective conditions. Anticipating these possible situations is good for protecting the enthusiasm of the masses and cadres, because this can give cadres and the masses the necessary mental preparation, so that they can still maintain vigorous enthusiasm under unfavorable conditions, and make the vigorous mass movement truly invincible, and also prevent another "anti-adventurism" storm. In short, we must implement Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions, both boost our energy and leave room for manoeuvre.

Next, Comrade Tan Zhenlin briefly explained some new major revisions and supplements made to the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program.

The meeting held group discussions and plenary speeches from the 6th. Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Chen Yun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Ulanhu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Bo Yibo, alternate members of the Political Bureau, Wang Jiaxiang, Li Xuefeng and other comrades, secretaries of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, responsible persons of many departments of the central state organs, commanders and political workers of the People's Liberation Army, responsible persons of mass organizations such as the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the All-China Women's Federation, the first secretaries of the Party committees of provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, responsible persons and staff members of Party committees at all levels of provinces (cities, autonomous regions), prefectures (cities), and counties, secretaries of Party committees of industrial and mining enterprises, factory directors and technicians, branch secretaries of townships, towns, and cooperatives, directors of agricultural cooperatives and directors of supply and marketing cooperatives, school principals and Party committee secretaries, etc., spoke at the meeting. A total of one hundred and seventeen people spoke at the meeting, and another one hundred and forty-five people made written speeches.

The representatives unanimously agreed in their speeches to the work report of the Central Committee of the Party made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the report on the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, the explanation on the Agricultural Development Program made by Comrade Tan Zhenlin, and unanimously agreed to the speech made by Comrade Mao Zedong. In their speeches, the representatives warmly supported the Party's general line for socialist construction, believing that this line will form the political basis for the Party's unity and will ensure that our country's socialist construction cause advances at the highest speed. The representatives believed that as long as the Party's general line is resolutely implemented, the time for our country's output of major industrial products to catch up with and even surpass Britain will not require fifteen years, and the time for realizing the various targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program will be greatly shortened.

The representatives discussed the historical lessons in the formation process of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and pointed out the great significance of correct ideological methods. They emphasized that in order to implement the general line of building socialism, it is necessary to implement "politics in command," to follow the mass line, to promote the noble style of communism, and to carry forward the creative spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act. Everyone also particularly emphasized the need to learn from Comrade Mao Zedong, to study his works, and to learn from his brilliant example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution.

In their speeches, the representatives discussed from many aspects how to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and widely exchanged experiences in industrial and agricultural production and other construction undertakings. Many speakers used vivid examples to illustrate how, with the victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and with the liberation of people's minds, the productive forces would be greatly developed. In their speeches, they talked about the plans and measures for realizing the Great Leap Forward in the metallurgical industry, machinery industry, coal industry, petroleum industry, power industry, geological exploration, construction industry, railway construction, transportation, agriculture, water conservancy, domestic and foreign trade, financial work, educational work, cultural work, and scientific work, talked about the experiences of running factories diligently and thriftily, running cooperatives diligently and thriftily, and running schools diligently and thriftily, the experience of workers participating in enterprise management and cadres practicing working with workers and doing experimental plots, the experience of large, medium, and small enterprises developing simultaneously and cooperating with each other, the experience of improving farm tools, deep plowing the land, increasing fertilizer accumulation, improving seeds, building water conservancy, overcoming sandstorms, and greening barren mountains, the experience of cultural revolution in rural areas, eliminating illiteracy, popularizing education, eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and changing customs, and also talked about how military work, public security work, and political and legal work serve the socialist construction cause.

Representatives from Zhejiang, Gansu, Anhui, Yunnan, Guangxi, Qinghai, Hebei, Guangdong, Xinjiang, Henan, Shandong and other provinces and autonomous regions reported in their speeches the experiences of the local Party organizations in the rectification movement in struggling against right-wing elements within the Party, as well as localist elements, nationalist elements, and right-leaning opportunist elements. The important right-wing elements exposed by the Party organizations in these regions include: Sha Wenhan, Yang Siyi, Peng Ruilin, members of the Standing Committee of the former Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, Sun Zhanglu and other right-wing elements, a right-wing anti-Party group headed by Sun Diancai, member of the Standing Committee of the former Gansu Provincial Party Committee, Liang Dajun, member of the Provincial Party Committee, and Chen Chengyi, deputy governor, a right-wing group headed by Li Shinong, former secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, an anti-Party group headed by Zheng Dun, former member of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, a right-wing group headed by Chen Zaili, former member of the Standing Committee of the Guangxi Provincial Party Committee, Sun Zuobin, former member of the Standing Committee of the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, anti-Party element, Liu Hongtao and other right-wing elements, former member of the Standing Committee of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee, Gu Dacun and Feng Baiju, alternate members of the Central Committee and former secretaries of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, who engaged in localist activities, Saifullah, Yiminov, Aisihaiti and other comrades, former secretaries of the Secretariat of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Party Committee, who engaged in nationalist activities, Pan Fusheng, alternate member of the Central Committee and former first secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee, who made right-leaning opportunist errors, and Li Feng, former first secretary of the Huimin Prefectural Party Committee of Shandong, and Cao Liqin, acting first secretary of the Tai'an Prefectural Party Committee, who opposed the Party's line and engaged in anti-Party activities. During the meeting, Comrade Feng Baiju made a written self-criticism of the serious mistakes of localism he had committed.

Many comrades elaborated on the views of the Moscow Declaration and criticized modern revisionism represented by the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in their speeches.

The discussion on the general line of socialist construction, the discussion on the anti-rightist struggle within the Party, and the discussion on the Moscow Declaration and the anti-revisionist struggle made the representatives feel that their ideology had been greatly improved.

After full discussions on the various agenda items, the conference held elections to elect alternate members of the Central Committee at the meeting on the 23rd, and then unanimously adopted three resolutions.

The Resolution on the Work Report of the Central Committee stated that the conference unanimously agreed with this report, unanimously agreed with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results proposed by the Party Central Committee based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong, and called on the entire Party and the people of the whole country to strive to implement this general line.

The Resolution on the Conference of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties held in Moscow stated that the conference unanimously agreed with the two declarations adopted by the Moscow Conference, believing that the conference opened a new stage in the modern international communist movement and gave great encouragement to the working people of the world and all peaceful, democratic, and progressive forces. The resolution made a solemn criticism of the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, believing that it was thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist and a concentrated manifestation of modern revisionism. The resolution pointed out: The Cominform's "Resolution on the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" in 1948 was basically correct, but there were shortcomings and errors in the method. The resolution also pointed out: Since 1954, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, headed by Comrade Khrushchev, initiated the improvement of relations with Yugoslavia, and took a series of measures for this purpose, which was completely necessary and correct. However, the leaders of the League of Communists completely disregarded the well-intentioned efforts of the communist parties of various countries, and at their congress they showed hostility towards the socialist camp and expressed flattery and gratitude to US imperialism. The resolution said that the conference fully agreed with the decision of the Party's Central Committee not to send a delegation but only to send observers to attend the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and believed that it was necessary to conduct a resolute struggle against modern revisionism.

The conference basically adopted the National Agricultural Development Program from 1956 to 1967, called on the entire Party to strive to realize this program ahead of schedule, and entrusted the Central Committee to submit this draft to the First Session of the Second National People's Congress for discussion and adoption and formal promulgation after making necessary revisions based on this year's implementation.

### 社会主义建设的总路线制定了

    “八大”二次会议号召向技术革命和文化革命进军
    社会主义建设的总路线制定了
    会议拥护莫斯科宣言，批判了现代修正主义的代表——南共纲领
    基本通过了全国农业发展纲要，动员全党全民提前实现这个纲要
    新华社24日讯　中国共产党第八届全国代表大会第二次会议二十三日下午闭幕。
    在昨天下午的会议上，通过了关于中央委员会工作报告的决议，通过了关于各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议的决议，通过了全国农业发展纲要（第二次修正草案），并且增选了二十五位同志为中央委员会候补委员。
    这次会议反映了整风运动、反右派斗争的胜利和社会主义建设事业的大跃进。这次会议本身就是一次整风的会议，一次反对国际修正主义、反对混入党内的右派分子、地方主义分子、民族主义分子的会议，一次大跃进的会议。
    这次会议是在五月五日下午开始举行的。在会议上，刘少奇同志作了关于党中央委员会的工作报告，邓小平同志作了关于各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议的报告，谭震林同志作了关于农业发展纲要（第二次修正草案）的说明。在会议期间，毛泽东同志在会上讲了话。
    刘少奇同志在报告中阐述了目前形势、党的社会主义建设的总路线和今后的各项任务。
    刘少奇同志在报告中说，在本届代表大会第一次会议到第二次会议一年多的时间内，党正确地执行了并且发展了第一次会议所决定的方针和政策，在各方面的工作中取得了巨大的成就。
    刘少奇同志在报告的第一部分分析了当前的国际形势和国内形势，总结了整风运动的成果和今年前四个月的工农业生产建设高潮的成果。他说，我们在社会主义的建设中，正在经历着马克思预言过的“一天等于二十年”的伟大时期。
    刘少奇同志的报告的第二部分详细地说明了党的社会主义建设总路线。他说，鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的基本点是：调动一切积极因素，正确处理人民内部矛盾；巩固和发展社会主义的全民所有制和集体所有制，巩固无产阶级专政和无产阶级国际团结；在继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命；在重工业优先发展的条件下，工业和农业同时并举；在集中领导、全面规划、分工协作的条件下，中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举；所有这些，目的在于尽快地把我国建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。
    他在报告的这一部分提出了技术革命和文化革命的主要任务，批判了对于社会主义建设总路线的反对意见，并且论证了工农业同时并举、中央工业地方工业同时并举、大中小型企业同时并举的必要。他指出：执行党的社会主义建设总路线的结果，将使我国的社会生产力大大地发展起来，将要大大地提高我国的劳动生产率，使我国工业在十五年或者更短的时间内，在主要的工业产品产量方面赶上和超过英国；使我国农业在提前实现全国农业发展纲要的基础上，迅速地超过资本主义国家；使我国的科学技术在实现十二年科学发展规划的基础上，尽快地赶上世界最先进的水平。
    刘少奇同志的报告接着讨论了党在整风运动方面的任务、改进国家工作方面的任务和加强党的领导的任务。关于党的领导，他着重指出了加强思想工作和政治工作的必要，指出了反对教条主义和经验主义、把唯物论和辩证法应用到实际工作中去的必要，指出了破除迷信，提倡革新创造、提倡为真理冲锋陷阵、树立先进和革命旗帜的必要。刘少奇同志指出：在国内加强对于六亿多人口的团结，在国际加强同以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的团结，我们的事业就一定能够胜利。
    邓小平同志在关于各国共产党和工人党的莫斯科会议的报告中说：莫斯科会议的两个宣言具有伟大的历史意义。十二国共产党的宣言，实际上是今后一个长时期的国际共产主义运动的纲领，它对当前形势和马克思列宁主义一系列的根本原则作了精确的分析。两个宣言得到了除南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟以外的全世界共产主义政党的赞同，得到了世界广大群众的欢迎和拥护。
    邓小平同志从国际形势、马克思列宁主义普遍真理和各国民族特点的相互关系、思想工作和反修正主义的斗争、加强社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的团结等方面阐述了莫斯科宣言的精神，同时批判了以南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领为代表的现代修正主义的各种谬论。
    邓小平同志指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领是反马克思列宁主义的彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，是新伯恩斯坦主义的最集中的代表。这个纲领的本质，在于丑化社会主义而美化资本主义，丑化无产阶级专政而美化资产阶级专政，丑化以苏联为首的社会主义阵营而美化以美国为首的帝国主义阵营，不要无产阶级在共产党的领导下进行反对资本主义和帝国主义阵营的斗争，放弃无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
    邓小平同志说：我们要加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，增进对世界各国兄弟党的团结，对国际共产主义运动中出现的现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争，这是我们所应负的国际义务。我们相信，沿着莫斯科宣言所指出的方向，国际共产主义运动将进到一个新的高涨时期。
    在关于全国农业发展纲要（第二次修正草案）的说明中，谭震林同志概括地叙述了从一九五五年冬到一九五八年春三个冬春的农业生产建设中由高到低又由低到高的马鞍形的发展过程，由此证明了坚持多快好省方针的必要和所谓“反冒进”的错误，证明了全国农业发展纲要的伟大作用。在讨论当前农业生产大跃进情况的时候，他说，按照各省、市、自治区的规划，全国将有几百个县市，在今年分别达到或者超过粮食亩产四百斤、五百斤、八百斤或者皮棉亩产一百斤的指标。现在，除少数单位外，各地提出的增产指标一般是积极的。目前的问题在于切实抓紧具体措施，要注意防止浮而不深、粗而不细、华而不实，以免秋后达不到指标要求。他还指出：在发展农业生产中，必须考虑到某些不利的客观因素出现的可能，例如发生不能控制的自然灾害，或者由于某些措施的客观条件不具备而落空。预计到这些可能出现的情况，对于保护群众和干部的积极性有好处，因为这样可以使干部和群众有必要的精神准备，使他们在不利的条件下仍然能够保持旺盛的干劲，使蓬蓬勃勃的群众运动真正立于不败之地，也可以防止再来一个“反冒进”的风波。总之，必须实行毛泽东同志的指示，既鼓干劲，又留余地。
    接着，谭震林同志扼要地解释了对于全国农业发展纲要修正草案所作的一些新的主要的修改和补充。
    会议自六日起进行小组讨论和大会发言。在大会上发言的有中共中央政治局委员周恩来、朱德、陈云、陈毅、李先念，政治局候补委员乌兰夫、张闻天、陆定一、陈伯达、康生、薄一波，中共中央书记处书记王稼祥、李雪峰等同志，有中央国家机关的很多部门的负责人，有人民解放军的指挥员和政治工作人员，有全国总工会、共产主义青年团和全国妇女联合会等群众团体的负责人，有各省、市、自治区党委的第一书记，有省（市、自治区）、地（市）、县等各级党委机关的负责人和工作人员，有工矿企业的党委书记、工厂厂长和技师，乡、镇、合作社的支部书记，农业合作社主任和供销合作社主任，有学校校长和党委书记等。在大会上发言的共有一百一十七人，另有一百四十五人作了书面发言。
    代表们在发言中一致表示同意刘少奇同志所作的党中央委员会的工作报告、邓小平同志所作的关于各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的报告、谭震林同志所作的关于农业发展纲要的说明，一致同意毛泽东同志的讲话。代表们在发言中，热烈拥护党的社会主义建设的总路线，认为这条路线将形成党的团结的政治基础，将保证我国社会主义建设事业以最高的速度前进。代表们认为，只要坚决贯彻执行党的这条总路线，我国的主要工业产品产量赶上以至超过英国的时间将不需要十五年，而实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的各项指标的时间，更将大大地缩短。
    代表们讨论了党的社会主义建设总路线的形成过程中的历史教训，指出了正确的思想方法的巨大意义。他们强调指出，为了贯彻执行建设社会主义的总路线，必须实行“政治挂帅”，必须走群众路线，必须提倡共产主义的崇高风格，发扬敢想敢说敢作的创造精神。大家还特别强调要向毛泽东同志学习，学习他的著作，学习他把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同中国革命的具体实践相结合的光辉榜样。
    在发言中，代表们从多方面讨论了怎样贯彻执行多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的问题，并广泛地交换了关于工农业生产和其他建设事业中的经验。许多发言的人用生动的事例说明，随着政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的胜利，随着人们的思想上的解放，生产力将会得到怎样巨大的发展。他们在发言中谈到了在冶金工业、机械工业、煤炭工业、石油工业、电力工业、地质勘探、建筑业、铁道建设、交通运输、农业、水利事业、国内外贸易、财政工作、教育工作、文化工作、科学工作中实现大跃进的计划和措施，谈到了勤俭办厂、勤俭办合作社、勤俭办学校的经验，实行工人参加企业管理工作和干部实行跟班劳动、搞试验田的经验，关于大、中、小企业同时并举、相互协作的经验，关于改良农具、深翻土地、增积肥料、改良种子、兴修水利、战胜沙荒、绿化荒山的经验，关于农村中的文化革命、消灭文盲、普及教育、除四害、讲卫生、移风易俗的经验，并且谈到了军事工作、公安工作、政法工作怎样为社会主义建设事业服务的问题。
    浙江、甘肃、安徽、云南、广西、青海、河北、广东、新疆、河南、山东等省和自治区的代表，在大会发言中报告了本地区党组织在整风运动中同党内的右派分子以及地方主义分子、民族主义分子、右倾机会主义分子作斗争的经过。被这些地区党组织所揭发出来的重要右派分子有：原浙江省委常委沙文汉、杨思一、彭瑞林、省委委员孙章禄等右派分子，以原甘肃省委常委孙殿才、省委委员梁大均、副省长陈成义等人为首的右派反党集团，以原安徽省委书记处书记李世农为首的右派集团，以原云南省委常委郑敦为首的反党集团，以原广西省委常委陈再励为首的右派集团，原青海省委常委、反党分子孙作宾，原河北省委常委、右派分子刘洪涛等人，这些右派分子都已被清除出党。此外，被揭发的还有进行地方主义活动的候补中央委员、原广东省委书记处书记古大存、冯白驹两同志，进行民族主义活动的原新疆维吾尔自治区党委书记处书记赛甫拉也夫、常委伊敏诺夫、艾斯海提等同志，犯有右倾机会主义错误的候补中央委员、原河南省委第一书记潘复生同志，反对党的路线、进行反党活动的原山东惠民地委第一书记李峰和原泰安地委代理第一书记曹礼琴等同志。在大会期间，冯白驹同志对自己所犯的地方主义的严重错误，作了书面检讨。
    不少同志在发言中阐述了莫斯科宣言的观点，批判了以南共纲领为代表的现代修正主义。
    关于社会主义建设总路线的讨论，关于党内反右派斗争的讨论，关于莫斯科宣言和反修正主义斗争的讨论，使代表们感觉到思想上得到了很大的提高。
    大会对于各项议程经过了充分的讨论以后，在二十三日的会议上，进行了增选候补中央委员的选举，然后全体一致地通过了三项决议。
    关于中央委员会的工作报告的决议说，大会一致同意这个报告，一致同意党中央根据毛泽东同志的创议而提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，号召全党和全国人民为贯彻执行这条总路线而奋斗。
    关于在莫斯科举行的各国共产党和工人党代表会议的决议说，大会一致同意莫斯科会议所通过的两个宣言，认为会议开辟了现代国际共产主义运动的新阶段，给了全世界劳动人民和一切和平民主进步的力量以极大的鼓舞。决议对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的纲领作了严正的批判，认为它是彻头彻尾反马克思列宁主义的，是现代修正主义的集中表现。决议指出：一九四八年共产党情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的决议”基本上是正确的，但是方法上有缺点和错误。决议又指出：一九五四年以来，以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏联共产党中央创议改善同南斯拉夫的关系，并且为此采取了一系列措施，是完全必要和正确的。但是南共领导人完全无视各国共产党的善意的努力，在他们的代表大会上敌视社会主义阵营而对美帝国主义表示了逢迎和感恩戴德。决议说，大会完全同意党的中央委员会不派代表团而仅派观察员列席南共代表大会的决定，并且认为必须同现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争。
    大会基本通过了一九五六年到一九六七年全国农业发展纲要，号召全党为提前实现这一纲要而奋斗，并且委托中央委员会在根据今年的实行情况再作必要的修改以后，把这个草案提交第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议讨论通过，正式公布。（附图片）
