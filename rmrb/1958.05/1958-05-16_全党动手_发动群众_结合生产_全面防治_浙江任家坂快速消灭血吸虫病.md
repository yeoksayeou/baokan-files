　　The Whole Party Takes Action, Mobilizes the Masses, Combines with Production, and Comprehensively Prevents and Controls
    Renjiaban, Zhejiang, Rapidly Eliminates Schistosomiasis
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter You Qi reports: After two months of arduous struggle, Renjiaban Village in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, has basically eliminated schistosomiasis. Nearly four hundred schistosomiasis patients who could be treated in the village have all received treatment. In the treatment work, they truly achieved the whole party taking action, mobilizing the masses, combining with production, and comprehensively preventing and controlling the disease, and implemented the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Currently, the youth snail eradication shock brigade organized by the Communist Youth League in the village, the masses, and the medical personnel of the prevention and control team are working intensely on eliminating snails, managing feces, and managing water usage.
    This prevention and control team has already created the province's highest record of each medical staff member treating fifty-four patients per month.
    Renjiaban Village is a severely schistosomiasis-stricken area, with more than four hundred and fifty patients, accounting for about one-third of the village's population. The village began preventing and controlling schistosomiasis in 1956. However, due to the local leaders and masses fearing that treatment would hinder production, and the masses fearing that treatment would affect their labor income, only fifty-eight patients were treated in the past two years. Furthermore, because comprehensive prevention and control measures were not taken, twenty-two people were re-infected.
    At the beginning of the treatment work, the prevention and control team encountered many difficulties. A pessimistic saying had long been circulating among the masses in Renjiaban Village: "Even immortals cannot cure 'sweeping broom belly' (late-stage symptoms of schistosomiasis)." The masses did not trust medical treatment, believing that underdevelopment due to illness was a natural physiological phenomenon, and that blood in the stool was caused by overwork. Patients with more severe symptoms also feared that the treatment would take too long, cost too much, and affect production and income. In response to these ideological situations, the local Party organization tirelessly persuaded and educated the masses. They used examples of the serious threat of schistosomiasis to the entire village to explain to the masses the principle of early treatment and early recovery; and repeatedly promoted the principle that the immediate interests of participating in production and guaranteeing income must be combined with long-term interests. They also calculated an account for the full labor force patients in the entire commune. If the two hundred and forty-seven sick full laborers in the whole commune could do fifty more workdays per person per year after being cured, after deducting the rest time spent before and after treatment, they could still increase the cooperative by more than nine thousand three hundred and eighty workdays this year. Through the propaganda and education of these facts, the ideological concerns of the commune members about fearing treatment were broken. In addition, the Party organization also gave full support to the prevention and control team and the Communist Youth League branch of the village, helping them solve various difficulties.
    In order to ensure that treatment did not hinder production, the agricultural cooperative leaders decided to first treat fifty children under the age of sixteen who were already on winter vacation before the Spring Festival, and put the first batch of seventy-five sick male full laborers into treatment after the fifth day of the first lunar month. However, around the Spring Festival, production tasks were still very heavy, so the commune leaders adopted the mass line method and convened a general meeting of all commune members for discussion. After debate, everyone unanimously agreed that as long as arrangements were made properly, both production and treatment could be ensured. If the labor force was insufficient, women, the elderly, and other semi-laborers would be mobilized to work together; if there was not enough time, conventions would be broken and there would be no rest during the Spring Festival. In this way, the construction of reservoirs, roads, and various production tasks were completed; and the seventy-five young and middle-aged people suffering from schistosomiasis were also admitted to the hospital for treatment as scheduled according to the original plan.
    Among all the patients in the village, except for a small number of late-stage patients, pregnant women, and other patients who could not be treated with antimony agents, all received the current short-term, low-cost antimony agent three-day treatment. The antimony agent three-day treatment was also applied to most of the elderly over fifty years old and children under fifteen years old, breaking the past conventions that the three-day treatment was too restrictive on age and weight.
    The temporary hospital and beds for treatment were prepared by the cooperative. The hospital site was borrowed from the Farmers' Association and the primary school, and door panels were used as beds. Bedding, meals, and thermos bottles were all brought by the patients themselves. Each patient only needed to pay two catties of firewood to the "hospital" every day, and the cooperative dispatched a service person to boil water and do cleaning work for the patients. Medical expenses were uniformly paid by the cooperative. Commune members with economic difficulties could be appropriately reduced or exempted from payment.
    While the injection treatment was being carried out, the entire village, led by the most active Communist Youth League branch, carried out the work of eliminating snails and managing feces and water. Even cattle, pigs, dogs, and ducks were managed. The cattle were raised collectively in the mountains, where ponds were specially dug for them. Chickens, ducks, pigs, and dogs were strictly supervised by each household to prevent their feces containing worm eggs from polluting the land and river water.

### 全党动手　发动群众　结合生产　全面防治  浙江任家坂快速消灭血吸虫病

　　全党动手　发动群众　结合生产　全面防治
    浙江任家坂快速消灭血吸虫病
    本报讯　记者尤淇报道：浙江省绍兴县任家坂村经过两个月的艰苦斗争，基本上消灭了血吸虫病，全村所有能够治疗的近四百个血吸虫病人都得到了治疗。在治疗工作中，他们真正做到了全党动手，发动群众，结合生产，全面防治，并且贯彻了多快好省的方针。目前，这个村共青团组织的青年灭螺突击队、全村群众和防治小组的医务人员，正在紧张地进行消灭钉螺、粪便管理和用水管理工作。
    这个防治组已经创造了每个医务人员每月治疗五十四个病人的全省最高纪录。
    任家坂村是血吸虫病严重流行的地区，有四百五十多个病人，约占全村三分之一的人口。这个村从1956年就开始防治血吸虫病，由于当地领导和群众怕治病妨碍生产，和群众怕治疗影响劳动收入，因此过去两年只治疗了五十八个病人。又因为没有采取综合性的防治措施，以致有二十二个人又重复受到了感染。
    治疗工作开始的时候，防治小组碰到许多困难。在任家坂村群众中早就流行着一句悲观的口谣：“神仙难医扫箕肚（血吸虫病的后期症状）”。群众对医药治疗并不信任，他们认为因病不发育是自然生理现象，大便带血是过度疲劳所致。症候较重的病人也怕治疗时间过长，费用大，影响生产和收入。针对这些思想情况，当地党组织对群众进行了不厌其烦的说服教育，他们运用全村严重受到血吸虫病威胁的事例，向群众说明早医早好的道理；并且把参加生产、保证收入的眼前利益必须和长远利益结合的道理向群众反复宣传。他们还把全社整劳动力病人算了一笔账。全社二百四十七个有病的整劳力，如以治好后每人每年多做五十个工来计算，除去治疗前后所花的休息时间，今年还可为合作社增加九千三百八十多个工。通过这些事实的宣传教育，打破了社员怕治病的思想顾虑。此外，党组织还特别给予防治组和这个村共青团支部以全力支持，帮助他们解决各种困难。
    为了使治疗不致妨碍生产，农业社领导上决定在春节前先治疗五十个十六岁以下已放寒假的少年儿童，把第一批七十五个有病的男整劳力放到农历正月初五以后去治。可是在春节前后，生产任务仍然非常繁重，社的领导就采取了群众路线的方法，召开全体社员大会进行讨论。经过辩论，大家一致认为只要安排得好，可以做到生产、治病两不误。劳动力不足，就发动妇女、老年人和其他半劳力一齐出动；时间不够，打破常规，春节期间不休息。就这样，修建水库、公路和各项生产任务都完成了；七十五个患血吸虫病的青壮年也都按照原订计划如期入院治疗。
    在全村病人中，除了一部分晚期病人、孕妇等不能用锑剂治疗的病人外，都受到了当前时间短、费用省的锑剂三日疗法的治疗。对五十岁以上的老年人和十五岁以下的少年儿童大部分也应用锑剂三日疗法，打破了过去三日疗法对年龄、体重限制过严的常规。
    治疗的临时医院和床铺是合作社筹办的，院址借用农会和小学，用门板当床铺。被褥、饭菜、热水瓶都由病人自带。每个病员只要每天向“医院”交二斤柴草，由合作社派一个服务员，为病人烧烧开水和作清洁卫生等工作。医药费统一由合作社垫付。经济上有困难的社员，可以适当进行减免。
    在注射治疗的同时，全村在最积极活跃的共青团支部带动下进行了消灭钉螺和粪便管理、用水管理的工作，连牛猪狗鸭都管理了起来，牛集中养到山上，在那里挖有专门供它们用的池塘，鸡鸭猪狗由各家严加看管，不使它们带有虫卵的粪便到处染污土地和河水。
