Communist Spirit Generates Tremendous Material Strength
Jiangxi People Conquer Flood

    (Our dispatch) After being tempered by the great rectification movement, the people of Jiangxi Province, with the spirit of communist cooperation, swiftly overcame the rainstorms and floods. Now, the floodwaters in all rivers have been forced to recede, the vast majority of dikes are safe and sound, and more than two million mu of flooded seedlings throughout the province have been completely rescued.

    Since the beginning of May, most areas of Jiangxi Province have experienced continuous heavy rain, and the water levels of various rivers have risen sharply one after another. The water levels of many rivers exceeded the warning line, and the water was raging. When flood prevention was tense, Nanchang County, located in the lower reaches of the Gan and Fu Rivers, requested that the brother counties in the upper reaches and non-flood areas intercept and store rainwater to reduce the burden on the lower reaches, so that they could buy time to raise and reinforce the dikes. This request received an enthusiastic response. The people of the counties in the Ji'an Special Zone, located in the upper reaches of the Gan River, under the unified leadership of the Prefectural Committee, quickly launched a movement to raise field ridges to intercept and store rainwater. In a few days, most of the fields stored four to six inches of water. The Shangrao Special Zone organized a province-wide flood control cooperation effort. The upper and lower reaches, the mountainous and plain areas, actively cooperated and achieved remarkable results. In early May of last year, the rainfall in the upper reaches of the Xin River was 154 mm, and the water level in the lower reaches reached more than 25 meters; the rainfall in the same period this year exceeded more than twice that of the same period last year, but the water level was only equal to that of last year. Liu Junxiu, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said that this kind of communist cooperation is a great achievement of the rectification movement in the past year. In the water storage movement, the people of the upper counties fully demonstrated the communist virtues of everyone for me, me for everyone, and selflessness.

    The Yangliu Dike on the Fu River is located between Wenjiazhen in Linchuan County and Zizhi Township in Jinxian County. Before the arrival of this flood, the farmers along the dike in the two counties had signed a cooperation agreement for flood prevention and emergency rescue. On the night of the 10th, a dangerous situation occurred in the dike section under the responsibility of Zizhi Township in Jinxian County, and 700 people from Wenjiazhen in Linchuan County rushed to help rescue it overnight. On the 12th, cracks and water leaks occurred in the dike section of Wenjiazhen in Linchuan, and the farmers of Zizhi Township in Jinxian County also automatically went to support. When the loopholes became larger and larger and the soil could not be blocked, the nearby Jinxian farmers ran to their homes to get cotton quilts to help the Linchuan farmers block the loopholes. The farmers along the dike in the two counties fought side by side like this, helping each other for five days and nights, and finally overcame the highest flood peak of the Fu River in history.

    After the flood receded, farmers everywhere immediately carried out replanting and seedling protection work. The problem of insufficient seedlings was solved by the friendly support from non-disaster areas and the mutual support between disaster areas. In Tongmu Township, Pingxiang County, 500 mu of early rice was washed into sandbars by the flood. The news that they lacked seedlings was telegraphed to Zhangjiafang, Xinquan, and Luxi townships, more than 200 li away from Tongmu Township. On the evening of the 10th, more than 1,400 people in these three townships pulled up more than 400 dan of surplus seedlings overnight in the rain, and immediately loaded them into trucks and set off to support. On the way, a section of the highway was washed away by the flood, and the trucks could not pass. When the farmers of Changping Township near the highway knew about this, all 1,100 farmers in the township immediately formed a highway repair team and worked hard for half a day to safely send the trucks away. The disaster-stricken areas also received support from all over the region in terms of labor in draining water and replanting seedlings.

    In this way, the people of Jiangxi Province have worked together to overcome the first rainstorm and flood of this year.

    共产主义精神产生巨大物质力量
    江西人民战胜洪水
    本报讯　经过伟大整风运动洗礼的江西省人民，以共产主义的协作精神迅速地战胜了暴雨洪水。现在，各河洪水已被迫回落，绝大部分圩堤安然无恙，全省二百多万亩被淹的禾苗已全部抢救出来。
    5月初以来，江西省大部地区连降暴雨，各河水位相继剧涨，许多河流水位超过警戒线，水势汹汹。当防汛紧张的时候，处在赣江和抚河下游的南昌县，请求上游的兄弟县和非汛区拦蓄雨水，减轻下游的负担，使他们能争取时间加高加固圩堤。这个请求得到了热情的回答。住在赣江上游的吉安专区各县人民，在地委的统一领导下，迅速展开了一个加高田塍拦蓄雨水运动，几天中大部分田就蓄了四寸到六寸深的水。上饶专区组织了全区抗洪大协作，上游、下游，山区、平原，积极协同作战，收到了显著效果。去年5月上旬信江上游降雨量为一百五十四公厘，下游水位达到二十五公尺多；今年同期的降雨量超过去年同期一倍以上，而水位只和去年相等。中共江西省委书记刘俊秀说，这种共产主义的大协作是一年来整风运动的伟大成果。在蓄水运动中，上游各县人民充分表现了人人为我、我为人人和舍己为人的共产主义美德。
    抚河上的杨柳大堤位于临川县的温家圳与进贤县的自治乡之间，在这次洪水到来之前，两县沿堤农民就订立了协作防洪抢险合同。10日夜，进贤自治乡负责的堤段发生险象，临川县温家圳便漏夜赶来了七百人帮助抢救。12日，临川温家圳堤段发生裂缝漏水，进贤自治乡的农民也自动赶去支援。当漏洞越来越大、泥土无法堵住时，附近的进贤农民又跑到自己家里拿来棉被帮临川农民堵住了漏洞。两县沿堤农民这样你帮我、我帮你并肩作战五昼夜，终于战胜了抚河这次历年来最高的洪峰。
    洪水退后，各地农民立即进行补苗、保苗工作。秧苗不足的问题，又因非灾区的友谊支援和灾区之间的互相支援得到了解决。萍乡县桐木乡有五百亩早稻被洪水冲成了沙洲，他们缺秧苗的消息通过电话传到了距离桐木乡二百多里路的张家坊、新泉、庐溪等三个乡，10日晚上，这三个乡的一千四百多人连夜冒雨拔起了四百多担多余秧苗，并立即装上汽车启运支援。在半路上有一段公路被洪水冲垮，汽车又走不过，公路附近长平乡的农民知道这件事，全乡一千一百多农民马上组成了公路抢修大队，苦战半天，把汽车安全送走了。受灾地区还在排涝、补苗中得到了各地在劳动力方面的支援。
    江西省人民就这样通力协作战胜了今年第一次的暴雨洪水。
