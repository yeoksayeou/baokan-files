Expanding rice cultivation is changing the low-yield face of the North
    This year, the rice paddy area in northern provinces will increase from 30 million mu last year to about 80 million mu. Many areas are increasing by multiples. Many counties will gradually become dominated by rice cultivation. Expanding rice cultivation has become a prominent aspect of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production.
    Expanding rice cultivation is a strategically significant measure to change the low-yield face of the area north of the Huai River in our country. Taking Tuanbowa in Jinghai County, Hebei Province, as an example, three years ago, there were only 70 mu of rice here. In 1957, it reached more than 95,000 mu, and this year it has expanded to 200,000 mu. After a year of experimentation and two years of large-scale promotion, Tianjin Prefecture had developed to 1.6 million mu in 1957 (including 600,000 mu of dry rice), and this year it will expand to 5 million mu. Due to the expansion of rice cultivation, Tuanbowa has rapidly increased the yield per mu of grain farmland from the original dozens of catties to more than 490 catties in just two or three years. Tuanbowa was originally a low-lying, waterlogged area that suffered from crop failure nine years out of ten. In 1954, each person only received 100 catties of grain, in 1955 they received 469 catties, and in 1957 it reached 1,198 catties. According to statistics from 1952 to 1954, the state issued as much as 240,000 yuan in relief funds to this area. In 1957, in addition to their own consumption, the farmers in this area sold 23.97 million catties of surplus grain to the state. Last year, although the rice area in Tianjin Prefecture only accounted for 7% of the total area of ​​grain crops in the region, the rice output accounted for 29.6% of the total grain output. In other areas where rice cultivation has been greatly expanded, the output has not increased by increments, but by multiples.
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out long ago: “Most of the area north of the Huai River has fertile land. According to existing experience, as long as rice can be replanted, the yield per unit area can be doubled or even several times increased. The unit yield in some places is even higher than that in the south of the Yangtze River. Therefore, not only should low-lying and waterlogged areas massively switch to rice cultivation, but all other areas with water sources, whether mountainous, hilly, or flat, should also massively switch to rice cultivation, in order to rapidly increase the output in low-yield areas north of the Huai River." The experience of Tianjin area once again proves that this policy is completely correct. Doing so is conducive to the country's economic construction, improving people's lives, and consolidating and developing the cooperative economy.
    Now, after the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, the cadres and masses in various places have improved their socialist enthusiasm and boosted their revolutionary spirit. Conditions for large-scale expansion of rice cultivation are already in place in terms of water conservancy, fertilizer, labor, technology, and agricultural cooperative investment. Various places are prepared to expand rice cultivation and strive for a bumper harvest. The vast majority of water conservancy projects are nearing completion. According to incomplete statistics on the water source situation of rice paddies in 42 counties at the recent Northern Rice Increase Promotion Conference, 73% have sufficient water sources, 22% have difficulties but can be solved, and only 5% have water sources that are temporarily not guaranteed. The completed figure for field projects accounts for 62% of the prescribed tasks. Seedling cultivation in various places is one solar term earlier than in previous years. Various places have mobilized the masses to manufacture a large number of irrigation tools and field operation tools. Henan Province alone has created more than 200 pieces. Technical preparations are also adequate. For example, Hebei Province has trained 1.3 million rice technicians. Henan Province has trained 450,000 people. Most new rice areas have adopted the methods of "inviting in" and "sending out" to carry out technical instruction. Judging from these situations, it is entirely possible to expand rice cultivation and strive for a bumper harvest this year.
    Advanced indicators are already available. In the future, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and do a more in-depth, more detailed, and more down-to-earth job of expanding rice cultivation and striving for a bumper harvest. Since we have decided to expand rice cultivation, we must take measures from all aspects to ensure it. The unfinished projects must be grasped and completed, and the leadership must be transferred to field production in a timely manner, and transferred to the struggle to strive for a bumper harvest.
    The most urgent task at present is to ensure the rice planting area and not violate the farming season. We must achieve "tasks assigned to the team, measures assigned to the field, and responsibilities assigned to individuals." The area must be implemented, and every measure and every production link must be firmly grasped. Whether or not the water needed for rice growth can be supplied in time is the key to ensuring the planting area. Although the water conservancy project has been basically completed, it is still necessary to conduct in-depth inspections and specifically calculate the water account, not only the total account, but also the account by household. If there is not enough, we must quickly take measures to further tap water sources, organize relevant irrigation areas to support each other, and regulate water use. If the canal project is not sound, it is necessary to rush to repair it, store all the water that can be stored, and ensure full planting so that the project construction is adapted to the development of rice. This year, the area of ​​expanded rice cultivation is large, and the state's supply of drainage and irrigation machinery cannot keep up with the needs. Various places cannot wait, but must rely on the masses, use local materials, and manufacture on the spot. Prepare the tools before using water, and prepare the water before transplanting seedlings.
    In the newly developed rice fields this year, the proportion of wheat stubble rice is very large. According to statistics from six provinces of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shaanxi, wheat stubble rice accounts for about 70%. Growing wheat stubble rice well is the key to striving for a comprehensive bumper harvest in the expansion of rice cultivation in the north this year. It is very urgent to harvest wheat well and plant rice well. This requires strengthening labor organization, rationally arranging farm work, sending the fertilizer needed for rice fields to the fields as early as possible, opening hair canals, and doing the work that can be done in advance as much as possible. Once the previous crop is harvested, immediately cultivate the land, build ridges, release water, and transplant seedlings. Harvest one piece and transplant one piece, and transplant as early as possible. For this reason, men, women, old and young must work together, and various forces in urban and rural areas must be organized to support.
    Ensuring the planting area is only the first step in completing this year's expansion task. To achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest, a series of tasks must be done well, and every link of increasing production must be firmly grasped, from beginning to end, throughout the year. In particular, it is necessary to pass several passes well according to the characteristics of the region: First, transplant seedlings early to promote early maturity and avoid early frost damage. This is the central issue of rice production in the north. Now, seedling transplanting is about to be carried out in various parts of the north. We must do a good job of field projects as soon as possible, level the land, open drainage and irrigation ditches, and would rather let the fields wait for the seedlings than let the seedlings wait for the fields. At the same time, we must do a good job in transplanting technical training to achieve dense planting and early sowing. Second, do a good job in field management such as fertilization, irrigation, middle tillage, weeding, and prevention and control of plant diseases and insect pests. Base fertilizer must be applied sufficiently, and attention should be paid to topdressing in stages and at appropriate times. With water, it must be managed and used well. A water use plan should be made, rational and economical water use should be advocated, shallow irrigation and frequent irrigation should be implemented, and the phenomena of string irrigation and flood irrigation should be overcome. Weeds must be "removed early" and "removed small." Third, due to the great development of water conservancy projects, the ability of various places to resist water and drought disasters has been greatly strengthened, but we cannot relax our vigilance. In particular, we must pay attention to drought, ensure water use during the dry season, and achieve a bumper harvest even without rain. Fourth, do a good job of harvesting and storage, harvest in time, dry, winnow, and strive to return the grains home.
    This year is the first year of large-scale expansion of rice cultivation. This year's success will pave the way for faster development in the future. Therefore, it must be successful, not fail. In the work of striving for a bumper rice harvest, various places may still encounter various difficulties in the future. We must be prepared to overcome this. We must add several times more energy to our efforts, and add several times more measures to our measures. We must strive for a bumper harvest in the new rice area, and also strive for a bumper harvest in the old rice area.

    扩种水稻改变北方低产面貌
    北方各省今年稻田面积将从去年的三千万亩增加到八千万亩左右。很多地区都是成倍地增加。不少县份将逐渐成为以种植水稻为主。扩种水稻已经成为今年农业生产大跃进的突出方面。
    扩种水稻，是改变我国淮河以北地区低产面貌的一项具有战略意义的措施。以河北省静海县团泊洼为例，三年前，这里只有水稻七十亩，1957年达到九万五千多亩，今年扩展到二十万亩。天津专区经过一年试验，两年大面积推广，1957年已经发展到一百六十万亩（其中有六十万亩旱稻），今年要扩展到五百万亩。团泊洼由于扩种了水稻，在短短的两、三年内，就把粮食耕地亩产由原来的几十斤迅速提高到四百九十多斤。团泊洼原来是一个十年九不收的低洼易涝区，1954年每人只得粮一百斤，1955年得四百六十九斤，而1957年竟达到一千一百九十八斤。1952年到1954年统计，国家发到这一地区的救济款达二十四万元之多。而1957年这个地区农民除了食用以外，还卖给国家余粮二千三百九十七万斤。天津专区去年水稻面积虽然只占全区粮食作物面积的7％，而稻谷产量却占粮食总产量的29.6％。其他大量扩种水稻的地区，产量也都不是一成成地增加，而是一倍倍地增加。
    中共中央早就指出：“淮河以北的大部分地区土地肥沃。根据已有的经验，只要能够改种水稻，单位面积的产量就可成倍甚至几倍地提高。有些地方的单位产量甚至比江南还高。因此，不但低洼易涝地区应当大量地改种水稻，其他一切有水源的地区，不论是山地、丘陵地、平地也应当大量地改种水稻，以便迅速提高淮河以北低产地区的产量。”天津地区的经验，又一次证明这个方针是完全正确的。这样做既有利于国家经济建设，也有利于改善人民生活，巩固和发展合作经济。
    现在，各地干部和群众经过整风运动和反右派斗争，提高了社会主义积极性，鼓起了革命干劲。无论水利、肥料、劳力、技术、以及农业社的投资方面，都已经具备了大量扩种水稻的条件。各地对扩种水稻、争取丰收是有准备的。绝大部分水利工程都已经接近完成。据最近北方水稻增产促进会议上四十二个县不完全的稻田水源情况统计，水源充足的占73％，尚有困难但可以解决的占22％，水源暂时还没有保证的只占5％。田间工程已经完成的数字占规定任务的62％。各地育秧都比往年要早一个节气。各地都发动群众，大量制造了许多种灌溉用具和田间作业工具。单是河南一省，就创造了二百多件。技术准备也很充分。如河北省已训练水稻技术员一百三十万人。河南省训练了四十五万人。大部新稻区都采取了“请进来”、“派出去”的办法开展了技术传授。从这些情况看，今年扩种水稻、争取丰收是完全可能的。
    先进的指标已经有了，今后就是要充分发动群众，依靠群众，更深入更细致更踏实地做好扩种水稻、力争丰收的各项具体工作。既然我们决定要扩种水稻，我们就要从各方面采取措施来保证。现在未完成的工程要抓紧搞好，领导力量要及时地转到田间生产上来，转到争取丰收的斗争方面来。
    当前第一件要紧的事，是保证水稻种植面积和不违农时。要做到“任务到队，措施到田，责任到人”。面积要落实，每项措施和每一生产环节都要紧紧抓住。能不能及时供给水稻生长所需要的水分，是保证种植面积的关键。现在水利工程虽已基本完成，还需要深入检查，具体算水账，不仅要算总账，还要算分户账，不足的要赶快采取措施，进一步挖掘水源，组织有关灌区相互支援，调剂用水。渠道工程不健全的，要突击修补，把能蓄的水都蓄起来，保证满栽满插，使工程建设与发展水稻相适应。今年扩种水稻的面积大，国家供应的排灌机械赶不上需要。各地不能等待，要依靠群众，就地取材，就地制造。做到用水之前准备好工具，插秧之前准备好水。
    在今年新发展的稻田中，麦茬稻的比重很大。据河北、河南、山东、江苏、安徽、陕西六个省的统计，麦茬稻占70％左右。种好麦茬稻是争取今年北方扩种水稻全面丰收的关键。既要收好小麦，又要栽好水稻，时间是十分紧迫的。这就需要加强劳动组织，合理安排农活，把稻田所需肥料及早送到田边，开好毛渠，把能提前的工作尽量提前作好。前茬作物一经收割，立即耕地、筑埂、放水、插秧，做到收一块，插一块，能早插一天就早插一天。为此必须男女老幼齐动手，并组织城乡各种力量支援。
    保证种植面积还只是完成今年扩种任务的第一步。要达到全面丰收，还须作好一系列工作，要紧紧抓住增产的每一个环节，自始至终，贯彻全年。特别要根据地区特点，过好几道关：第一，提早插秧，促进早熟，避免早霜为害。这是北方水稻生产的中心问题。现在北方各地即将进行插秧，要及早做好田间工程，平整土地，开好排灌沟渠，宁叫田等秧，不叫秧等田。同时要作好插秧技术训练，做到密植早播。第二，作好施肥、灌溉、中耕、除草及防治病虫害等田间管理。基肥必须施足，并注意分期适时追肥。有了水，还必须管好用好。要作好用水计划，提倡合理节约用水，实行浅灌、勤灌，克服串灌、漫灌现象。对杂草必须“除早”、“除小”。第三，由于水利工程大发展，各地抵抗水旱灾害的能力大大加强了，但还不能放松警惕。特别是要注意旱灾，保证枯水期的用水，作到无雨也能保丰收。第四，做好收获和贮藏工作，及时收割、晒干、扬净、争取颗粒还家。
    今年是大规模扩种水稻的第一年。今年的成功，将为今后更快的发展铺平道路。因此就必须成功，不能失败。在争取水稻丰收的工作中，各地今后仍然可能遇到各种困难。对此必须有准备地加以克服。我们必须干劲之上再加几倍干劲，措施之上再加几倍措施，既要力争新稻区丰收，也要力争老稻区丰收。
