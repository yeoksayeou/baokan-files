Notes

    The trend of peaceful competition has frightened the United States. Dulles had to come up with an American way to deal with it.

    But Dulles' magic weapon is truly astonishing. He warned that "the United States should not set aside spiritual values and concentrate on competing with Russia for material superiority."

    Why is Dulles, who has always boasted of America's "economic power," now so timid and ridiculous?

    Dulles' brother, CIA Director Allen Dulles, revealed the truth: In the first quarter of this year, Soviet industrial production rose by 11% compared with the same period last year, while the United States fell by 11%. How can we compete? It seems that this spy chief is unwilling to accept his brother's spirit of Ah Q, and he wants the United States to face up to the "most serious challenge" of the Soviet Union in economic competition.

    But it cannot be said that Allen Dulles is bolder, because he cannot come up with a better way. He can still only adopt another spirit of Ah Q, whistling to embolden himself, that's all.

    精神胜利法
    和平竞赛的趋势吓得美国发抖。杜勒斯不得不提出美国的对付之法。
    但杜勒斯的法宝，着实惊人。他警告说：“美国不要撇开精神价值而去全神贯注地同俄国进行争取物质优势的竞赛”。
    一直夸耀美国“经济威力”的杜勒斯，为什么现在胆怯得这样可笑了呢？
    杜勒斯的兄弟、美国中央情报局长艾伦·杜勒斯道出了真相：今年第一季度与去年同期相比，苏联工业生产上升了11％，而美国则下降了11％，怎么能竞赛呢？看来这个特务头子还不愿接受乃兄的精神胜利法，他要美国正视苏联在经济竞赛上的“最严重的挑战”。
    但不能说，艾伦·杜勒斯的胆子大一些，因为他也拿不出更好的办法来。他仍然只能采用另一种精神胜利法，吹吹口哨壮胆，如此而已。
