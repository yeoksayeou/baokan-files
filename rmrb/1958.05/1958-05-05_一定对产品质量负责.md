Letter to the Editor:

    Must Be Responsible for Product Quality
    The "People's Daily" published on April 21st a letter from Comrade Zhang Xi of the Southeast Anhui Geological Team entitled "Tianjin Medical Equipment Factory Should Be Responsible for Product Quality," criticizing our factory for not being responsible for product quality. The actual situation is this: After they first wrote to us pointing out the problem, we immediately replied, telling them how to solve it. They wrote a second time saying that the problem still could not be solved. Then, on April 15th, our factory sent someone to their location to inspect and repair the equipment. We have not yet received a reply regarding the results. But regardless, we must take responsibility for product quality. Therefore, our factory proposes the following solutions, and we hope the Southeast Anhui Geological Team will consider them:

    1. If, after inspection and repair, the product quality still does not meet the requirements of the instruction manual, our factory will be responsible for the repair, and the costs will be borne by our factory.

    2. If the problem is due to improper operation or insufficient voltage, all expenses incurred by our factory in sending personnel to the geological team will be borne by them.

### 一定对产品质量负责

    一定对产品质量负责
    4月21日人民日报发表皖东南地质队张曦同志“天津医疗器械厂应该对产品质量负责”的来信，批评我厂对产品质量不负责任。这件事的实际情况是这样：他们第一次来信提出毛病后，我们即回信告给他们怎样解决。他们第二次来信说仍旧不能解决。接着，我厂就在4月15日派人到他们那里去检查修理，结果怎样，还没有得到回信。但是不管怎样，我们对产品质量一定要负责任。因此我厂提出以下解决办法，希望皖东南地质队考虑。
    1、如果经过检查修理，产品质量仍旧达不到使用说明书的要求，我厂负责修理，费用由我厂负责；
    2、如果因操作不当或者电压不够等，则我厂派人到地质队的一切费用由他们自己负责。
