　　对中苏等国的声明
　　印度尼西亚外长表示欢迎
    新华社雅加达16日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在今天对报界发表的声明中表示，他欢迎苏联、中国、印度、缅甸、阿拉伯联合共和国等国发表的关于指责外国干涉印度尼西亚的官方声明。他说，因为这种外国干涉只会使问题复杂化。
    苏班德里约今天早上在外交部同苏联驻印度尼西亚大使茹科夫和中国驻印度尼西亚临时代办甘野陶会谈以后发表了上述声明。他们在会谈中讨论了苏、中两国政府先后在14日和15日发表的关于反对干涉印度尼西亚内政问题的声明。苏班德里约还同苏联大使讨论了有关苏联给印度尼西亚的一亿美元贷款的细节问题。
    苏加诺总统今天接见了朱安达总理、苏班德里约和三军参谋长，讨论了苏、中两国政府发表的声明。
    据新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚“东星报”今天发表社论说，苏联和中国政府就印度尼西亚局势发表的声明指出了一个真理，就是印度尼西亚的安全和领土完整是有关世界安全的问题，任何侵犯印度尼西亚的阴谋都意味着威胁国际和平。
