Xinhua News Agency dispatches: The U.S. government is creating pretexts to take action, plotting to further intensify intervention in the Lebanese situation.

According to a report in the "Washington Post and Times Herald" on the 17th, Secretary of State Dulles said in a secret report to Senate bipartisan leaders on the 15th that the United States was "prepared to send American armed forces to land in Lebanon." The report said that Dulles indicated that the United States intended to execute this decision once the Lebanese authorities made a request to the United States, or to the United Nations Security Council, claiming so-called "large-scale foreign intervention" in the Lebanese situation. The report said that bipartisan senators did not express opposition to Dulles's report.

On the same day that Dulles's secret report was revealed, the U.S. Air Force Department announced that it had dispatched eighteen C-124 military transport aircraft to U.S. Air Force bases in West Germany. According to reports, these aircraft are capable of transporting troops to Lebanon "when necessary."

According to Western news agencies, U.S. Air Force transport planes transported automatic rifles, tear gas, and many other police equipment to Beirut on the 18th. The airport was placed under strict guard when American planes landed at Beirut airport. Many Lebanese army trucks lined up on the runway, loaded with American equipment unloaded from the planes, and drove away. According to reports, more American planes transporting weapons to the Lebanese government will continue to arrive in Beirut soon.

The Lebanese National United Front issued another statement on the 17th opposing foreign intervention in Lebanon.

The statement pointed out that Western imperialist countries are preparing to hold military exercises in the eastern Mediterranean, thinking that such exercises can intimidate the Lebanese people. The statement said, "We can guarantee that the conspirators will find that Lebanon is a country determined to fight against any foreign intervention and to achieve the goals of the people."

Armed conflicts between the insurgent people and government military police continued to develop in various parts of Lebanon on the 17th. According to the Middle East News Agency, residents of Tripoli established a local government called the "Public Committee" on the 17th and began managing the civil affairs of Tripoli. Former Prime Minister Karami, parliamentarian Mohammed Hamzi, and Abd al-Majid Rifa'i of the Arab Ba'ath Socialist Party, among others, participated in this twenty-five-member public committee.

According to Beirut's "Al Anwar" newspaper, Beirut residents once attempted to seize the city prison. The general strike throughout the city continues, and the port is paralyzed.

Lebanese Prime Minister Solh delivered a radio address to the nation on the 16th, calling on the Lebanese people to "restore domestic order." He described the current domestic situation as: communication systems, water supply systems, and power lines have been destroyed, bridges have been blown up, government agencies have been attacked, bomb explosions are heard everywhere, fires are raging, and security forces and customs are under attack.

    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：美国政府正在制造借口采取行动，图谋进一步加紧干涉黎巴嫩的局势。
    据“华盛顿邮报和时代先驱报”17日报道，国务卿杜勒斯15日在向参议院两党领袖所作的秘密报告中说，美国“准备派美国武装部队到黎巴嫩登陆”。消息说，杜勒斯表示，一旦黎巴嫩当局向美国提出要求，或者向联合国安全理事会提出有外国所谓“大规模干涉”黎巴嫩局势时，美国就打算执行这个决定。消息说，两党参议员对杜勒斯的报告没有表示反对。
    在杜勒斯的秘密报告透露出来的同一天，美国空军部宣布已经派遣十八架C—一二四型军队运输机前往西德的美国空军基地。据报道，这些飞机能够在“必要时”运军队去黎巴嫩。
    另据西方通讯社报道，美国空军的运输机在18日把包括自动步枪、催泪弹和警察用的其他许多装备运到贝鲁特。在美国飞机在贝鲁特机场着陆时，机场被置于严密的警戒之下。黎巴嫩陆军的许多卡车排在跑道上，装满从机上卸下的美国装备后开走。据报道，更多的运送武器给黎巴嫩政府的美国飞机最近将继续到达贝鲁特。
    黎巴嫩民族统一阵线在17日再次发表关于反对外国干涉黎巴嫩的声明。
    声明指出，西方帝国主义国家正在准备在地中海东部举行军事演习，它们以为这样的演习能够吓倒黎巴嫩人民。声明说，“我们可以保证，阴谋家们将会发现，黎巴嫩是一个决心为反对任何外国干涉和实现人民的目标而进行战斗的国家。”
    黎巴嫩各地起义人民同政府军警的武装冲突17日仍在继续发展。据中东通讯社报道，的黎波里的居民在17日成立了名叫“公众委员会”的地方政府，开始管理的黎波里的民政。前总理卡拉米、议员穆罕默德·哈姆齐和阿拉伯复兴社会党的阿卜杜勒·马吉德·里法伊等参加了这个二十五人的公众委员会。
    据贝鲁特“晚报”报道，贝鲁特居民曾经企图攻占市监狱。全市总罢工仍在继续，港口陷于瘫痪。
    黎巴嫩总理索勒哈16日向全国发表广播演说，呼吁黎巴嫩人民“恢复国内秩序”。他描绘当前的国内局势是：通讯系统、供水系统和电线都被毁坏，桥梁被炸，政府机关遭到袭击，炸弹爆炸声此起彼伏，遍地起火，保安部队和海关受到袭击。
