Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 20th – The insurgent people in various parts of Lebanon continue to fight, resolutely resisting the suppression by government military police. Meanwhile, increasing reports indicate that the United States has directly participated in suppressing the Lebanese insurgents through various means.

Tripoli remains under the control of the insurgent people. In Beirut and other areas, strikes and armed conflicts are ongoing. In Beirut, government security forces engaged in a gun battle with the masses on the 19th, resulting in thirty injuries.

It is reported that one of the leaders of the Lebanese opposition party, Karami, arrived in Beirut from Tripoli on the evening of the 19th to hold talks with other opposition leaders, Salam, Raymond Edde (leader of the National Bloc), and others, regarding the current situation. According to Damascus newspapers, they decided to continue the struggle.

According to the Middle East News Agency, aircraft of the Lebanese government army, piloted by Americans, bombed Tripoli, which is under the control of the insurgents, killing four children and four adults. The news agency said that during the large-scale offensive launched by the government army against Tripoli on the 18th, American-piloted aircraft bombed the city's port in an attempt to cover the government army's landing. However, the insurgent masses repelled all attacks.

According to the Damascus newspaper "Al-Jamahir" today, American military experts in Beirut are directing the Lebanese security forces and army. The newspaper said that among the more than one thousand American experts in Lebanon, only one hundred and fifty are non-military personnel, and the rest are active-duty officers in civilian clothes.

Meanwhile, according to "Al-Rai," Turkey has been supplying weapons to the Lebanese government. The newspaper also said that two hundred reactionary members of the National Socialist Party have arrived in Beirut by plane from Jordan. The newspaper said that these party members had received military training in Jordan under the supervision of American officers.

The United States' interventionist behavior continues to be condemned by Lebanese patriots. According to Damascus Radio, the leader of the Lebanese Socialist Progressive Party, Jumblatt, sent a statement to the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, protesting the U.S. attitude toward the Lebanese people and demanding that the U.S. cease interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs. The "Free Lebanon Radio" in Tripoli strongly condemned the U.S. interventionist behavior in its broadcasts. The radio station said that the Lebanese people now understand very well that the purpose of the Eisenhower Doctrine is to suppress all national liberation movements.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 20th – London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, in answering questions in the House of Commons on the 19th, refused to guarantee that he would not interfere in the Lebanese situation.

Lloyd said that Britain has been taking so-called "routine precautionary measures" and will continue to maintain close contact with the United States and other allies regarding "actions that may have to be taken." He said that after exchanging views with the United States, France, and other relevant countries, they believe that the three-nation declaration of 1950 on intervening in the Middle East situation is "still valid."

The U.S., British, and French declaration on the Middle East situation stipulates that these three countries can take actions within and outside the United Nations to intervene in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries when they deem it necessary.

The British Foreign Secretary also said that the issue of submitting the Lebanese situation to the United Nations is currently "under discussion." He created an excuse for intervening in the Lebanese situation, saying that in the current situation in Lebanon, there is "undoubtedly" "evidence" of so-called "foreign subversive forces" engaging in activities.

It is reported that, in addition to sending the Navy to the Eastern Mediterranean to threaten the Lebanese people along with the U.S. Sixth Fleet, Britain has also taken other military measures to intervene in the Lebanese situation. A battalion of paratroopers is already ready for departure in Britain, and another four battalions are ready in Cyprus.

Lloyd confirmed that neither British nor American troops are taking action as part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces. This means that they will act separately according to the aggressive intentions of their own governments.

    美国人驾驶飞机掩护政府军进攻的黎波里失败
    劳埃德承认美英法正密谋公开干涉黎巴嫩局势
    新华社大马士革20日电　黎巴嫩各地起义人民仍在继续战斗，坚决抗击政府军警的镇压。同时，有愈来愈多的消息表明，美国已经通过各种方式直接参预镇压黎巴嫩起义人民。
    的黎波里仍然被起义人民控制着。在贝鲁特和其他地区，罢工和武装冲突在持续中。在贝鲁特，政府保安部队19日同群众进行了一场枪战，有三十人受伤。
    据报道，黎巴嫩反对党领袖之一卡拉米19日晚间从的黎波里到达贝鲁特，同其他反对党领袖萨拉姆、雷蒙德·埃迪（民族集团领袖）等就当前局势举行会谈。据大马士革报纸报道，他们决定继续进行斗争。
    据中东通讯社报道，由美国人驾驶的黎巴嫩政府军的飞机曾经轰炸了在起义者控制下的的黎波里，有四个儿童和四个成年人被炸死。这家通讯社说，在18日政府军对的黎波里发动大举进攻时，美国人驾驶的飞机轰炸了这个城市的港口，企图掩护政府军登陆。但是起义群众打退了一切进攻。
    据大马士革“群众报”今天报道，在贝鲁特的美国军事专家正在指挥黎巴嫩的保安部队和陆军。这家报纸说，在黎巴嫩的一千多名美国专家中只有一百五十人是非军事人员，其他的都是穿平民服装的现役军官。
    同时，据“舆论报”报道，土耳其已经在供给黎巴嫩政府武器。这家报纸还说，有二百名反动的国家社会党徒已经从约旦乘飞机到达贝鲁特。报纸说，这些党徒曾经在约旦在美国军官的监督下受了军事训练。
    美国的干涉行为继续遭到黎巴嫩爱国人士的谴责。据大马士革电台广播，黎巴嫩社会主义进步党领袖琼布拉特送给美国驻黎巴嫩大使一项声明，抗议美国对黎巴嫩人民的态度，要求美国停止干涉黎巴嫩内政。的黎波里的“自由黎巴嫩电台”在广播中强烈谴责美国的干涉行为，这家电台说，黎巴嫩人民现在很明白，艾森豪威尔主义的目的是要镇压一切民族解放运动。
    据新华社伦敦20日电　伦敦消息：英国外交大臣劳埃德19日在下院答复问题时拒绝保证不干涉黎巴嫩的局势。
    劳埃德说，英国一直在采取所谓“例行的预防措施”，并且将继续同美国和其他盟国就“可能必须采取的行动”保持密切接触。他说，经过同美、法等有关国家交换意见的结果，它们认为三国1950年干涉中东局势的宣言是“继续有效的”。
    美、英、法三国关于中东局势的宣言规定这三个国家在它们认为必要时，可以在联合国内外采取行动来干涉中东国家的事务。
    英国外交大臣还说，现在正在就把黎巴嫩局势提交联合国的问题“进行讨论”。他为干涉黎巴嫩局势制造借口说，在黎巴嫩目前的局势中，“无疑”有所谓“外来颠覆力量”进行活动的“证据”。
    据报道，目前英国除了派遣海军到东地中海和美国第六舰队一起对黎巴嫩人民施行威胁外，它还为干涉黎巴嫩局势采取了其他军事措施。一营伞兵已经在英国整装待发，另外还有四营军队在塞浦路斯准备就绪。
  劳埃德证实，英国和美国的军队都不是作为北大西洋集团军队的一部分而采取行动的。这就是说，它们将分别按照自己政府侵略的意图采取行动。
