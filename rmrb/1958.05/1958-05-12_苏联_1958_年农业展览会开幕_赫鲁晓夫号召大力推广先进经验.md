　　Soviet 1958 Agricultural Exhibition Opens
　　Khrushchev Calls for Vigorous Promotion of Advanced Experience
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th -- According to TASS, the 1958 Soviet Agricultural Exhibition opened in Moscow on the 11th. This is the fifth national agricultural exhibition held in the Soviet Union after World War II.
    Today, the opening ceremony of the exhibition, attended by thousands of people, was held on the "Collective Farm Square" of the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition Hall in the northern suburbs of Moscow. The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, delegations from various Soviet republics, advanced agricultural producers, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to the Soviet Union attended the meeting.
    Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, spoke at the meeting.
    In his speech, Khrushchev talked about the great achievements the Soviet Union has made in developing industry, agriculture, science, and culture in recent years. He said that in recent years, 1,100 advanced agricultural workers in the Soviet Union have been awarded the title of "Hero of Socialist Labor" for their outstanding achievements in land reclamation and improving agricultural production indicators, and more than 210,000 people have been awarded various medals and decorations.
    Khrushchev pointed out that most collective farms in the Soviet Union have now purchased agricultural machinery and other technical equipment based on the decree of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on reorganizing machine tractor stations and further developing the collective farm system, and are effectively using this equipment. He said that the achievements of Soviet science and practice have now become the wealth of the broad masses. Now, publicizing and adopting advanced experience has become more and more important.
    In order to strengthen the publicity and promotion of advanced experience, Khrushchev suggested that the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition should be expanded into the National Economic Exhibition, exhibiting the achievements of Soviet industry, agriculture, science, and culture, and that a specialized All-Union Agricultural Exhibition could be held in Moscow every five years. He said that each Soviet republic should also hold an agricultural exhibition every two or three years, and each district and state in the country should hold them more often, so as to promptly promote advanced experience locally.
    The Soviet Agricultural Exhibition Hall has a total of 314 exhibition halls and buildings. Since 1954, a Soviet Agricultural Exhibition has been held here every year to showcase agricultural production achievements and the production experience and technology of advanced collective farms and state farms. Due to the further comprehensive upsurge in Soviet agricultural production last year, not only advanced collective farms, state farms, and districts, but also 70 states, border regions, and union republics have been approved to participate in the exhibition this year. In addition, more than 600 tractors, various agricultural machines, and farm implements are also on display here.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 9th -- Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich pointed out at a press conference held on the 9th that after the Central Committee of the CPSU issued the resolution on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations, by the beginning of May, 46,000 collective farms in the Soviet Union had purchased tractors and other machines, accounting for 64% of the country's collective farms. All collective farms in the Moldavian Republic have purchased agricultural machinery, and collective farms that have purchased machinery in the Ukrainian Republic account for 93% of the republic's collective farms, and the Azerbaijan Republic accounts for 86%.
    He also said that about half of the machine tractor stations in the Soviet Union have sold 30% of their tractors to collective farms, and the value of machines sold by machine tractor stations to collective farms has reached 8 billion rubles.
    Regarding spring plowing work, Matskevich said that although this spring came later than in previous years, the spring plowing work is proceeding smoothly. As of May 5, 37 million hectares had been sown nationwide. In terms of animal husbandry, in the first quarter of this year, the state purchased 14% more milk and 26% more livestock than in the same period last year.
    Matskevich also talked about the Soviet Agricultural Exhibition, which will officially open on the 11th, at the press conference. He pointed out that this year's agricultural exhibition will open in a situation where the people of the country are showing high political enthusiasm for the realization of the program for further development of agriculture put forward by the Communist Party and the government. He said that this year's exhibition will showcase 260 new agricultural machines. Many machines will be operated during the exhibition. Among the dairy cows on display, there is one dairy cow that can produce more than 13,700 kilograms of milk per year. This year, more than 20,000 collective farms and state farms will participate in the exhibition.

　　苏联1958年农业展览会开幕
    赫鲁晓夫号召大力推广先进经验
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：1958年苏联农业展览会11日在莫斯科开幕。这是第二次世界大战后苏联举办的第五次全国农业展览会。
    今天，在莫斯科北郊的苏联农业展览馆的“集体农庄广场”上举行了有数千人参加的展览会开幕大会。参加大会的有苏联共产党和政府的领导人、各加盟共和国的代表团、农业先进生产者和各国驻苏联的外交使节。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在大会上讲了话。
    赫鲁晓夫在讲话中谈到了最近几年苏联在发展工业、农业、科学和文化方面所取得的巨大成就。他说，最近几年来，苏联有一千一百个农业先进工作者由于在开垦荒地和提高农业生产指标方面作出卓越的成绩而获得了“社会主义劳动英雄”称号，有二十一万多人被授予各种勋章和奖章。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，苏联的大多数集体农庄根据苏联最高苏维埃关于改组机器拖拉机站和进一步发展集体农庄制度的法令，现在已经购买了农业机器和其他技术设备，而且有成效地在利用这些设备。他说，苏联科学和实践的成就现在已经成为广大群众的财富。现在，宣传和采用先进经验就有了越来越大的意义。
    为了加强宣传和推广先进经验，赫鲁晓夫建议今后把苏联农业展览会扩大成为展出苏联工业、农业、科学和文化成就的国民经济展览会，而专门的全苏农业展览会可以每五年在莫斯科举行一次。他说，各加盟共和国每两三年也应该举行一次农业展览会，全国各个区和州应该举行得更多，以便及时在地方推广先进经验。
    苏联农业展览馆总共有三百一十四个展览馆和建筑物。从1954年起，每年都要在这里举行一次苏联农业展览会，以便展出农业生产成就和先进集体农庄和国营农场的生产经验和技术。由于去年苏联农业生产进一步获得了全面的高涨，今年被批准参加展览会的不仅有先进的集体农庄、国营农场和区，而且有七十个州、边疆区和加盟共和国。此外，这里还展出了六百多台拖拉机、各种农业机器和农具。
    新华社莫斯科9日电　苏联农业部长马茨凯维奇在9日举行的记者招待会上指出，在苏共中央发布关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的决议以后，到5月初，苏联已经有四万六千个集体农庄购买了拖拉机和其他机器，它们占全国集体农庄的64％。摩尔达维亚共和国所有的集体农庄都已经购买了农业机器，乌克兰共和国购买机器的集体农庄占全共和国集体农庄的93％，阿塞拜疆共和国占86％。
    他又说，苏联全国约有半数的机器拖拉机站已经将30％的拖拉机卖给了集体农庄，机器拖拉机站卖给集体农庄的机器价值达八十亿卢布。
    关于春耕工作，马茨凯维奇说，今年春天虽然比往年来得晚，但是春耕工作进行顺利。到5月5日为止，全国已经播种了三千七百万公顷。在畜牧业方面，今年第一季度国家收购的牛奶比去年同期增加了14％，收购的牲畜增加了26％。
    马茨凯维奇在记者招待会上还谈到了即将在11日正式开幕的苏联农业展览会。他指出，今年的农业展览会将在全国人民为实现共产党和政府所提出的进一步发展农业的纲领而表现出政治热情高涨的情况下开幕。他说，今年展览会将要展出二百六十种新的农业机器。许多机器在展出时将进行操作表演。在展出的奶牛中，有一种奶牛每年能产奶一万三千七百多公斤。今年将有二万多个集体农庄和国营农场参加展览。
