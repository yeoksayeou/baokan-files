　　Jiangxi Finds a Large Iron Ore Deposit

The Jiangxi Provincial Geological Bureau, based on aerial magnetic anomaly clues, has discovered a huge sedimentary metamorphic iron ore deposit in the areas of Xinyu, Fenyi, Anfu, Xiajiang, and Ji'an. Preliminary investigations have revealed that this ore is of medium-grade magnetite. The known ore body is currently tens of kilometers long, with stable changes in the composition content of the ore layer. The ore is easy to select, and the structure of the ore body is not complex. A large part of it can be mined in open pits. The mining area is only 20 kilometers away from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and very close to the two major coalfields of Pingxiang and Fengcheng. The currently known reserves are estimated to be sufficient for a steel smelter with an annual output of one million tons to use for more than two hundred years.

　　江西找到了大铁矿
    江西省地质局根据航空磁力异常线索，在新喻、分宜、安福、峡江、吉安一带，找到了属于沉积变质型的巨大铁矿。这个矿经初步查明是中等的磁铁矿，目前已知矿体长达数十公里，矿层厚度组分含量变化稳定，矿石易于选取，矿体构造不复杂，且有很大一部分能露天开采。矿区离浙赣路仅二十公里，离萍乡、丰城二大煤田也很近。目前已知藏量预计可供年产百万吨钢铁冶炼厂应用二百年以上。
