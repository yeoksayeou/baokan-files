Providing Power Fuel for Agricultural Mechanization
Wuzhou Refines Diesel from Castor Oil

(Our report) According to the Guangxi Daily, the Wuzhou Refinery has successfully refined diesel from castor oil, guaranteeing the power fuel needed for agricultural mechanization. On April 29, the Wuzhou Match Factory used four catties of diesel refined by the refinery in a 25-horsepower diesel engine test. The test proved that the diesel was of good quality, easy to ignite, had high thermal energy, produced little smoke, and the diesel engine ran stably and fuel-efficiently.

The refinery's latest products made from its own pressed castor oil, in addition to high-speed diesel, light diesel, and heavy diesel, also include tractor oil No. 40, oil No. 30, axle oil, machine oil, as well as brake oil for cars, water-soluble oil for steamships, and medicinal castor oil.

According to Xu Qingfeng, an engineer at the factory, vegetable oil can be refined into diesel using high temperature, high pressure, or the calcium soap method. Due to equipment limitations, they used the calcium soap method for trial production. This method can also be called the indigenous method. The specific steps are: First, for every 100 catties of castor oil, add 20% of finely powdered lime that has been sifted through a sieve, mix well, and heat. When heated to 180 degrees Celsius, it turns into calcium soap. Then pour out the calcium soap and place it on a cement floor to cool into blocks. Second, place the cooled calcium soap into a distillation pot and heat to 180 degrees. Crude oil will then be produced and continue to be heated to 360 degrees. Each 100 catties can produce 66 to 70 catties of crude oil. Third, put the crude oil into a fractional distillation pot for heating and fractionation control. The oil fractionated below 200 degrees is gasoline, accounting for about 15%. The oil fractionated between 200 and 280 degrees is kerosene, accounting for about 25%. The oil fractionated above 280 degrees is diesel, accounting for about 50%. Finally, various types of diesel can be produced by blending. For example, gasoline plus kerosene becomes high-speed diesel; diesel plus kerosene becomes light diesel; and 30% light diesel mixed with 70% deacidified rice bran oil becomes heavy diesel.

Engineer Xu said that the calcium soap method can not only turn castor oil into various diesel fuels but also turn rice bran oil or various wild plant oils into multiple diesel fuels. Although this method has the disadvantages of requiring more labor and having a slightly lower recovery rate, it has simple equipment, requires little investment, is relatively easy to learn, and production is relatively safe, making it valuable for widespread promotion in special districts, counties, or agricultural cooperatives.

(Our report) On April 30, the Guangxi Daily published an editorial on the Wuzhou Refinery's successful refining of diesel from castor oil, stating: The Wuzhou Refinery's successful refining of various diesel fuels from castor oil has found a new way to obtain power fuel for the realization of agricultural mechanization in our region. Castor is a herbaceous oil crop with great development prospects in our region. Our region has a mild climate and abundant rainfall, which can fully meet the needs of the entire growing season of castor. Castor also has strong adaptability and can grow on relatively barren land, sandy soil, and even alkaline soil. It can be planted everywhere in fields, on field edges, ditch edges, road edges, mountains, and small plots in front of and behind houses. Castor has extremely wide uses. Castor seeds have a high oil content, and the extracted castor oil can be used for various purposes, such as a superior lubricant for machines, soap, agricultural insecticides, and raw materials for nylon, dyes, and synthetic rubber. The by-products are also very useful, making it a priceless treasure. Most importantly, as proven by the practice of the Wuzhou Refinery, castor oil can also be refined into diesel, which can be used as power fuel for agricultural machinery and rural power stations. This is of great significance for implementing agricultural mechanization and developing agricultural production.

Since castor has such wide uses, all localities are required to attach great importance to this work, mobilize the masses, and plant it everywhere as much as possible. Not only should we mobilize commune members, but also mobilize government agencies, organizations, schools, industrial and mining enterprises, residents, etc., to plant castor, each person planting ten, dozens, or hundreds of plants, utilizing all open spaces and mountains. We must plant more, plant quickly, and plant well.

The editorial said that while widely planting castor in rural areas, industrial departments, in accordance with the policy of serving agricultural production, should continue to conduct experiments to better refine diesel from castor oil and other wild plant oils. It is hoped that all factories and enterprises, especially technical personnel, should boldly conceive, work deeply, meticulously, and practically, dare to think and dare to do, hand over technology to the people, dedicate their wisdom and strength to the socialist great leap forward, and achieve greater success in supporting agricultural production!

    为农业机械化提供动力燃料
    梧州用蓖麻油炼柴油
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：梧州炼油厂用蓖麻油炼制柴油成功，为农业机械化需用的动力燃料提供了保证。4月29日，梧州火柴厂用炼油厂试炼出来的四斤柴油在二十五马力的柴油机上试验，证明这种柴油质量很好，点火容易，热能大，烟气少，而且柴油机运行得既稳定又省油。
    炼油厂最近用自己压榨的蓖麻油制成的新产品，除高速柴油、轻柴油、重柴油外，还有拖拉机用的四十号机油、三十号机油、车轴油、机器油以及汽车用刹车油、汽船用调水油、医药用蓖麻油等多种。
    据这个厂的工程师徐庆凤说，用植物油炼制柴油，可采用高温、高压或钙皂法。由于设备的关系，他们采用了钙皂法进行试制。这种方法也可叫土制法。具体做法是：第一步，如用一百斤蓖麻油，要加20％的用筛子筛过的细石灰粉调匀后加热，加热到摄氏一百八十度即变成钙皂，再将钙皂倒出放在洋灰做成的地板上冷却成块状；第二步，将冷却钙皂放到蒸馏锅中加热到一百八十度，即出毛油了，一直加热到三百六十度仍出油，每百斤可出毛油六十六斤至七十斤；第三步，将毛油放入分流锅中加热，分流控制，温度在两百度以下分出的油即是汽油，占15％左右；两百到两百八十度分出的则为火油，占25％左右；两百八十度以上分出的油即是柴油，占50％左右。最后可采用配制方法制出各种柴油，如汽油加火油则成高速柴油，柴油加火油则成轻柴油，如以30％的轻柴油配以70％的除酸米糠油就成为重柴油了。
    徐工程师说，用钙皂法不但可以把蓖麻油制成各种柴油，而且也可把米糠油或各种野生植物油制成多种柴油。这种方法虽然有花人工多、收回率稍低的缺点，但其设备简单，投资少，操作较容易学会，生产也比较安全，在专区、县或农业社有普遍推广的价值。
    本报讯　4月30日，广西日报就梧州炼油厂用蓖麻油炼成柴油的事情，发表社论说：梧州炼油厂用蓖麻油炼制各种柴油成功，给我区农业实现机械化找到了动力燃料的新途径。蓖麻是我区大有发展前途的一种草本油料作物。我区气候温和，雨量相当充沛，完全能够满足蓖麻整个生长发育期的需求。蓖麻的适应性又很强，在比较瘠薄的土地，在沙砾土以至含有碱性的土壤上都可生长，田头、地边、沟边、路边、山岭、屋前屋后小块土地到处都可种植。蓖麻的用途也极为广泛，蓖麻籽含油率很高，提炼出来的蓖麻油可作各种各样的用途，如用以作机器的优等润滑油、肥皂、农业杀虫剂，还可作尼龙、染料和人造橡胶等等的原料，其副产品的用处也很多，真是无价之宝。而特别重要的是，经梧州炼油厂实践所证明了的，蓖麻油还能炼制成柴油，可作农业机械和农村发电站的动力燃料，这对实行农业机械化发展农业生产有重大的意义。
    既然蓖麻用途有如此广大，就要求各地对这一工作充分重视起来，发动群众，尽可能在各处种植。不仅要发动社员群众，而且要发动机关、团体、学校、工矿企业、居民等都来种植蓖麻，每人种它十株几十株或几百株，把所有空地和山岭都利用起来，要种得多、种得快、种得好。
    社论说，在农村广植蓖麻的同时，工业部门根据为农业生产服务的方针，应当继续进行试验，更好地把蓖麻油和其他野生植物油炼制柴油。希望各工厂企业，特别是技术人员应当大胆设想，深入、细致、踏实地干，敢想敢做，把技术交给人民，为社会主义大跃进献出自己的智慧和力量，在支援农业生产上取得更大的成绩！
