    An Outstanding Young Pioneers Farm
    Xiachen Elementary School in Huangyan Achieves Excellent Results in Cultivating New Varieties
    (This report) Our newspaper reporter Zhang Jisheng reported: The children of the Young Pioneers Farm of Xiachen Central Elementary School in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, under the guidance of teachers, have conducted experiments in cultivating new varieties such as barley branching, sorghum pollen hybridization with rice, and potato and tomato grafting for several years, and have achieved excellent results.
    This Young Pioneers Farm used methods such as salt water seed selection, variable temperature soaking, dibbling, row planting, transplanting, and sunbathing to cultivate barley with five ears on one stalk in 1955, which won a special prize and a hundred yuan bonus at the National Children's Science and Technology and Craft Works Exhibition held in Beijing in the same year. In 1956, this farm cultivated barley with eight ears on one stalk, which was selected by the Ministry of Education for exhibition in East Germany. After the news spread, many schools and farms in Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Hebei and other provinces wrote to congratulate them, requesting seeds and exchange of experience.
    In the past two years, the Young Pioneers Farm has also cultivated more than ten corn plants with three branches; by hybridizing sorghum pollen with rice, late rice has been transformed into early rice; by grafting bottle gourds and pumpkins, pumpkins weighing fifty catties have been cultivated; they also used Zhejiang Xiaoshan chickens to crossbreed with Australian Black chickens, and the resulting chicks weighed five and a half catties after they grew up.
    This Young Pioneers Farm was developed from the "Young Gardeners Group" established by Xiachen Elementary School in 1954. More than 400 students in the school participated in the activities of this farm. The farm has a total of three and a half mu of land, divided into five planting areas: rice, citrus, vegetables, Young Pioneers forest, and experimental garden, as well as an "animal breeding corner," which are respectively managed by eight classes and eleven teachers. Children are often led by teachers to visit agricultural cooperatives and farmers' homes to learn about the cultivation of various crops and the breeding of poultry and livestock, combining the scientific knowledge learned from books to conduct experiments and research on the farm. The children also learned from the old farmers knowledge of preventing epidemics by using needles and feeding garlic juice. The "Michurin Experimental Center Group," composed of senior children, often communicates with the agricultural experiment station of Wenzhou Prefecture and the Huangyan County Farm, and subscribes to various magazines such as "Agricultural Science" for learning.
    The creative activities of the Young Pioneers Farm have received care and support from all parties. The Huangyan County Bureau of Culture and Education built a small house for them to raise chickens and rabbits, and the nearby agricultural cooperatives often lent them耕牛 and agricultural tools. The Young Pioneers Farm used the bonus money to purchase agricultural tools, rabbit sheds, and chicken coops. Members of the agricultural cooperative often visit the Young Pioneers Farm and ask for barley and rice seeds to try planting in the cooperative's experimental fields. The members praised the new varieties cultivated by the Young Pioneers Farm, saying that this farm is the "agricultural experiment and extension station in the village."
    Through practice on the farm, most of the senior students of Xiachen Elementary School have now learned selection, seed soaking, sowing, weeding, fertilizing, land preparation, pest control, and complex grafting techniques, as well as breeding methods for chickens, geese, ducks, and rabbits; the junior students have also learned light labor such as watering and weeding. Many students are also conducting barley branching experiments in their own private plots or flowerpots at home. Now, the children of the Young Pioneers Farm have harvested the wheat and barley and are preparing to conduct intercropping experiments with soybeans and mung beans, citrus and vegetables this year, and also plan to raise 500 fish in the small pond next to the field.

### 一个出色的少年农场  黄岩下陈小学培育新品种成绩优异

    一个出色的少年农场
    黄岩下陈小学培育新品种成绩优异
    本报讯　记者张济生报道：浙江省黄岩县下陈乡中心小学少年农场的孩子们，几年来在教师的指导下进行了大麦分枝、高粱花粉与水稻杂交、马铃薯和蕃茄嫁接等培育新品种的试验，获得了优异成绩。
    这个少年农场采用盐水选种、变温浸种、点播、条播、移植和日光浴等方法，在1955年培育出一杆五穗的大麦，得到了同年在北京举行的全国少年儿童科学技术和工艺作品展览会的特等奖和一百元奖金。1956年这个农场又培育出一杆八穗的大麦，被教育部选送到民主德国展览。这个消息传出后，广东、广西、四川、河北等省的许多学校和农场都写信来向他们祝贺，要求赠送种子和交流经验。
    两年来，少年农场还培育出十多棵分为三枝的玉米；用高粱花粉和水稻杂交后，使晚稻变为早稻；把蒲瓜和南瓜嫁接，培育出五十斤的南瓜；他们还用浙江萧山鸡同澳洲黑鸡杂交，所生的子鸡成长后体重达五斤半。
    这个少年农场是由下陈小学在1954年成立的“少年园艺小组”发展而成的。全校四百多个学生都参加了这个农场的活动。全场共有三亩半田地，划分为水稻、柑桔、蔬菜、少年林和实验园地等五个种植区，还有一个“动物饲养角”，分别由八个班级和十一位教员负责。孩子们经常由教师们带领到农业社和农民家去访问，了解当地各种农作物的栽培和家禽家畜的饲养情况，结合从书本上学来的科学知识在农场上进行试验研究。孩子们还从老农民那里学到用针扎、喂食大蒜汁等防瘟知识。由高年级儿童组成的“米丘林实验中心小组”，经常与温州专区的农业试验站和黄岩县农场通信联系，并且订了“农业科学”等多种杂志进行学习。
    少年农场创造性的活动得到了各方面的关怀和支持。黄岩县文教局为他们盖了一间饲养鸡、兔的小屋，附近的农业社经常把耕牛和农具借给他们使用。少年农场用奖金添置了农具、兔舍和鸡笼。农业社的社员们常到少年农场参观，并且索取大麦和水稻的种子在社的试验田里试种。社员们对少年农场培育出的新品种赞不绝口，说这个农场是“村里的农业试验推广站”。
    经过在农场的实践，现在下陈小学高年级的学生大部分都学会了选种、浸种、播种、耘田、施肥、整地、治虫和复杂嫁接等操作技术，以及鸡、鹅、鸭、兔的饲养和配种方法；低年级的学生也学会了浇水、拔草等轻微劳动。不少学生还在家里的自留地或瓦盆里进行大麦分枝的试验。现在，少年农场的孩子们已经把大小麦收割好，准备在今年进行大豆与绿豆、柑桔与蔬菜的套作试验，还计划在田旁的小塘里养五百条鱼。
