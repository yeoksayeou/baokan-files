　　The Iranian People Cannot Be Subjugated
　　By a commentator of this newspaper
    According to reports from Tehran, Ruzbeh, a prominent Iranian patriot, was murdered by the Iranian authorities on May 11. The Iranian authorities secretly executed Ruzbeh in a barracks before disclosing the matter. They flagrantly disregarded the condemnation of the Iranian people and the protests of international public opinion, and finally committed this extremely barbaric crime.
    Ruzbeh was an outstanding Iranian patriot. His entire life and activities were devoted to the Iranian people. He was innocent! His only real "crime" was that he waged an unyielding struggle for Iran's national independence and the interests of the people. It was only for this reason that the reactionary ruling clique of Iran regarded him as a thorn in their side and resolved to murder him. Last July, the Iranian authorities suddenly arrested Ruzbeh, sent him to a military court for a so-called trial, subjected him to severe torture, and deprived him of the right to defend himself. This was completely a despicable murder! The criminal was not Ruzbeh, but precisely the reactionary Iranian group that murdered Ruzbeh. The lives of Ruzbeh, the outstanding son of the Iranian people, and countless other Iranian patriots, were thus innocently taken. The Iranian authorities' barbaric acts of slaughtering patriots cannot but arouse great indignation among the Iranian people and all upright people.
    The Iranian authorities' barbaric measures of slaughtering patriots are entirely in the service of imperialist aggressors. Today, under the plunder and enslavement of imperialism, led by the United States, Iran's independent sovereignty and national interests have been severely damaged, and the Iranian people are in dire straits. Millions of Iranian people are demanding a change in this situation, and they are increasingly uniting to carry out struggles. This is, of course, what the imperialists fear most, because when the people rise up, the blood-sucking tubes they have inserted into Iran will become unreliable. It is precisely under these circumstances that the reactionary ruling group of Iran has raised its butcher knife against Iranian patriots. They murdered Ruzbeh, murdered countless patriots, is it not to allow the imperialists to plunder more oil from Iran and suck more blood and sweat from the Iranian people!
    In the Iranian people's patriotic struggle, Ruzbeh gloriously sacrificed himself, but Ruzbeh's patriotic spirit will never die. In the prisons and courts of the reactionary Iranian authorities, in the face of severe torture and inhuman torment, he remained steadfast and fought for truth and justice to his last breath. This heroic spirit makes all upright people respect him, and Ruzbeh will live in the hearts of all upright people. Ruzbeh's heroic spirit brilliantly demonstrates that the Iranian people are unyielding, and that the Iranian people will persevere in their struggle to the end to defend their motherland's independence and freedom, and to defend their right to live.

　　伊朗人民不可屈
　　本报评论员
    据德黑兰消息，伊朗著名爱国者鲁兹贝赫于5月11日被伊朗当局杀害了。伊朗当局在一个兵营中把鲁兹贝赫秘密处死以后，才把这件事情透露出来。他们悍然不顾伊朗人民的谴责，不顾国际舆论的抗议，终于干下了这种极端野蛮的罪行。
    鲁兹贝赫是一个卓越的伊朗爱国者。他的全部生活和活动，都是忠于伊朗人民的。他没有罪！他的唯一的真正的“罪名”就是：他为伊朗的民族独立和人民利益进行了坚韧不拔的斗争。只是因为这样，伊朗的反动统治集团把他视为眼中钉，决心要杀害他。去年7月，伊朗当局突然逮捕了鲁兹贝赫，把他送到军事法庭进行所谓审讯，同时施以严刑拷打，并且剥夺了鲁兹贝赫为自己申辩的权利。这完全是卑鄙的谋杀！犯罪的不是鲁兹贝赫，恰恰就是谋杀鲁兹贝赫的伊朗反动集团。伊朗人民的优秀儿子鲁兹贝赫以及许许多多的伊朗爱国者的生命，就是这样被无辜地杀害了。伊朗当局这种屠杀爱国者的暴行，不能不激起伊朗人民和一切正直人民的极大愤慨。
    伊朗当局屠杀爱国者的野蛮措施，完全是为帝国主义侵略者服务的。今天，在以美国为首的帝国主义的掠夺和奴役下，伊朗的独立主权和民族利益遭到了严重的损害，伊朗人民正处于水深火热之中。千百万的伊朗人民要求改变这种状况，他们日益团结起来进行斗争。这当然是帝国主义者最害怕的事情，因为当人民起来的时候，他们插在伊朗身上的吸血管就会靠不住了。正是在这种情况下，伊朗反动统治集团向伊朗爱国者举起了屠刀。他们杀害了鲁兹贝赫，杀害了无数爱国者，难道不就是为了让帝国主义者从伊朗掠夺更多的石油，从伊朗人民身上吸吮更多的血汗吗！
    在伊朗人民的爱国主义斗争中，鲁兹贝赫光荣地牺牲了，但是鲁兹贝赫的爱国主义精神是永远不死的。鲁兹贝赫在伊朗反动当局的监狱中和法庭上，在严刑拷打和非人的折磨面前，他坚贞不屈，为真理和正义斗争到最后一口气。这种英雄气概使一切正直的人们无不对他表示崇敬，鲁兹贝赫将活在一切正直人们的心中。鲁兹贝赫的英雄气概光辉地表现了伊朗人民是不屈的，伊朗人民将为保卫祖国的独立自由，为保卫自己的生活权利而坚持斗争到底。
