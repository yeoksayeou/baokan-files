    The Crystallization of "Redness" and "Expertise"
    The article "Heroic Factory with Unique Style" published on page 3 of the People's Daily on May 8th is a very good article. This article tells people a truth: "Man can conquer nature," and "Heroic people create heroic deeds." As long as a person has the spirit and determination to wholeheartedly struggle for the people, for the country, and for the cause of communism to the end, they can overcome all difficulties; what they cannot do can be learned, and what seems impossible can be achieved. This is how the Benxi Alloy Factory started from scratch. It not only solved the problem of buying imported goods for many factories, but also accumulated funds for the country. This is precisely the result of the "redness" and "expertise" of heroic figures.
    This article is very educational, it can inspire people to think deeply, and it can encourage people to move forward. It is truly a very thought-provoking article. I hope the People's Daily will publish more articles of this weight in the future.

### “红”与“专”的结晶

    “红”与“专”的结晶
    5月8日人民日报第三版刊载的“独创风格的英雄工厂”是一篇很好的文章。这篇文章告诉了人们一个真理：“人定胜天”，“英雄人创造英雄事”。一个人只要有全心全意为人民、为国家、为共产主义事业奋斗到底的精神和决心，就能战胜一切困难，不会做的能学会，不能做的也做得出来。本溪合金厂就是这样白手起家的，它不但给很多工厂解决了买进口货的问题，而且为国家积累了资金，这正是英雄人物们又“红”又“专”的结果。
    这篇文章给人的教育很大，能启发人深思，能鼓舞人前进，真是一篇思想性很强的文章。希望人民日报以后多登这样有份量的文章。
