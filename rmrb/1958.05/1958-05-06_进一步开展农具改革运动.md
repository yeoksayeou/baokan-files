    Further Develop the Agricultural Tool Reform Movement

    The National Agricultural Tool Exhibition has opened. This exhibition is a great review of the mass technical innovation movement in the nationwide agricultural production leap forward of last winter and this spring. This exhibition vividly demonstrates the infinite wisdom of the Chinese people and unfolds a brilliant prospect for the technical revolution of agriculture in our country. Through this exhibition, the promotion of improved agricultural tools will undoubtedly play an active role in accelerating the technical transformation of agriculture in our country, realizing a great leap forward in agricultural production, and achieving the "four-five-eight" target and other indicators stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule.

    During the upsurge of agricultural production and construction across the country last winter and this spring, the enthusiasm of the peasant masses surged, and men, women, and children all worked together to create unprecedented miracles. In terms of farmland water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and the transformation of saline-alkali land, over 25 billion cubic meters of earth and stone were completed, the irrigated area was expanded by over 350 million mu, and 270 billion dan of fertilizer were accumulated (statistics as of April 25). This was achieved on the one hand by relying on the revolutionary spirit of the masses, and on the other hand by relying on the wisdom of the masses, reforming production tools, and improving labor efficiency. Because under the current conditions in our country, to carry out such large-scale water conservancy projects and fertilizer accumulation, as well as to improve the soil and change the farming system, requires a large amount of labor, so the first problem that must be solved is the shortage of labor. Therefore, with the development of the production upsurge, the tool reform movement unfolded like a raging fire.

    The agricultural tool reform movement is a creative labor with broad mass participation. The main force in the movement is the producers themselves, workers, farmers, and handicraftsmen. Starting from the urgent needs of their own production and life, they have fully exerted their intelligence and wisdom, and created and improved tens of thousands of tools. These tools are simple in structure, easy to operate, low in cost, require little effort, and yield great results, and even one item can be used for several purposes. All these agricultural tool reforms have significant local characteristics and are very adaptable to local natural conditions. Because our country has a vast territory and the natural conditions vary greatly from place to place, the north and the south are different, the plains and the mountains are different, and the marshland and the hilly areas are different. Therefore, all the improved and newly created agricultural tools have the characteristics and advantages of being diverse, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and being suitable for local use. Field labor in the Jianghan Plain area of Hubei Province has always relied on human carrying and shoulder pole, and there are few carts, so "cartization" and "trailerization" are the urgent needs of the local people. In Shandong and Hebei, most areas use carts for transportation, so their slogan is "rubber tireization" and "three-wheelization." The slogan in various mountainous areas is "aerial ropewayization" and "railwayization." Water network areas are "boatization" and "motorized sailing boatization." With the advancement of the agricultural production season, the development of the agricultural tool reform movement has gradually expanded to cultivation tools (various plows, harrows, close planting, rice transplanting tools) and processing tools (mills, grinders, slicers, shredders, etc.). In the summer and autumn seasons, plant protection tools and harvesting tools will inevitably undergo a series of updates and developments. This is foreseeable. All these reforms have reduced the burden of labor to varying degrees, saved labor, and improved labor efficiency, which has greatly improved the technical level of agriculture in our country.

    The rapid development of this movement on a national scale is not an accidental phenomenon, but has profound social and historical reasons. The cooperativization of agricultural production has freed the broad masses of peasants from having to worry about the fate of their small plots of land and crops all day long. People appear as members of large-scale production, with a relatively detailed division of labor, and often carry out large-scale collective production. Under such circumstances, the reform of a tool can play a huge role in production, and people have the opportunity and possibility to concentrate on studying one or several reforms. In addition, the active leadership and support of the Party and the People's Government have enabled people who originally did not dare to think or do to dare to think and dare to do. This is the background of the mass tool reform movement.

    The current agricultural tool reform movement is a mass movement with great revolutionary significance and is the bud of the technical revolution of agriculture in our country. The long-term backwardness of agriculture in our country, in addition to social and political reasons, one of the important reasons is that agricultural technology has remained at a very low level for a long time. The agricultural tools used by Chinese farmers have not been greatly improved for hundreds or even more than a thousand years. To greatly develop agricultural production in our country, to make agriculture in our country catch up with and surpass all capitalist countries—this is the ambition that the people of our country should have—we must modernize agriculture in our country, that is, transform the agricultural economy to the technical foundation of modern large-scale production, the technical foundation of mechanization, so that all agricultural production that can use machines will use modern machines, so that the difference between agricultural labor and industrial labor is reduced, and the difference between rural and urban areas is reduced. This is the goal of the agricultural technical revolution in our country. To achieve this goal, judging from the current situation, it is not a very distant matter. In the past one or two months, eighteen kinds of small tractors have appeared across the country, which is a powerful proof. It is wrong to hold a mystified view of agricultural mechanization. However, it should also be pointed out that to achieve agricultural mechanization, we cannot achieve it overnight. The current realistic and most urgent problem is to improve agricultural technology on the existing basis, gradually from improved agricultural tools to semi-mechanization to complete mechanization. It is unrealistic and dangerous to despise improved agricultural tools and sit and wait for tractors. At present, our country has a situation in which improved agricultural tools, semi-mechanization (new-style animal-powered agricultural tools) and mechanization (various power-driven agricultural machines) coexist. At present, we should focus on improved agricultural tools. At the same time, we should gradually realize semi-mechanization and mechanization as soon as possible. The current improved agricultural tool movement is a process from quantitative change to qualitative change. The more creations it has, the more varieties it has, the wider its scope, and the faster its progress, the more it will accelerate the early arrival of agricultural mechanization in our country.

    When Comrade Liu Shaoqi visited the Guangdong Agricultural Tool Reform and Promotion Exhibition, he said: "This kind of technical innovation movement is like a car that has already started and will never stop, not stopping for a day, not stopping for ten thousand years." We must actively lead this movement and gradually realize the great historical task of establishing a modern agriculture in our country.

### 进一步开展农具改革运动

    进一步开展农具改革运动
    全国农具展览会开幕了。这个展览会是去冬今春全国农业生产大跃进中群众性的技术革新运动的大检阅。这个展览会极其生动地表明了我国人民群众的无穷无尽的智慧，为我国农业的技术革命展开了光辉的前景。通过这次展览，推广改良农具，对于加快我国农业的技术改造，实现农业生产的大跃进，提前实现“四五八”和农业发展纲要所规定的其他指标，无疑都将发生积极的促进作用。
    去冬今春全国各地农业生产建设的高潮中，农民群众热情汹涌澎湃，男女老少一齐动手，做出了前无古人的奇迹。在农田水利、保持水土、改造盐碱洼地的工程方面，完成土石方二百五十多亿公方，扩大灌溉面积三亿五千多万亩，积肥二千七百亿担（4月25日统计）。这一方面是依靠群众的革命干劲，另一方面是依靠群众的智慧，改革了生产工具，提高了劳动效率。因为在我国当前的条件下，要做这样大规模的水利工程和积肥，还要改良土壤，改变耕作制度，这就需要大量的劳动力，所以首先必须解决的劳动力不足的问题。因此，随着生产高潮的发展，改革工具运动如火如荼地展开了。
    农具改革运动是一个具有广泛群众性的创造性的劳动。运动中的主力是生产者自己，工人、农民和手工业者。他们从自己生产和生活中的迫切要求出发，充分地发挥了自己的聪明才智，创造和改进了成千上万种的工具。这些工具构造简单，操作方便，造价低廉，费力小，收效大，甚至一物可以数用。所有这些农具改革，都带有显著的地方特点，十分适应于当地的自然条件。因为我国幅员广大，各地自然条件悬殊很大，北方和南方不同，平原和山地不同，湖沼地带和丘陵地带不同。因此，所有一切改良与创制的农具，就具有品种繁多、因地制宜、就地取材和适合当地使用的特点和优点。湖北省江汉平原区的田间劳动，历来依靠人背肩挑，素少车子，所以“车子化”和“拖子化”便是当地人民的迫切要求。在山东和河北，大部地区都是车子运输，所以他们的口号是“胶轮化”、“三轮化”。各地山区的口号，则是“天线化”、“轨道化”。水网地区则是“船舶化”和“机帆船化”。农具改革运动的发展，随着农业生产季节的推移，逐步扩大到耕作农具（各种犁耙、密植、插秧工具）、加工工具（碾、磨、切片、切丝等）。在夏秋季节里，植物保护方面的农具和收获农具也必将得到一系列的更新和发展。这是可以想见的。所有这些改革，都不同程度地减轻了劳动的繁重，节省了劳动力，提高了劳动效率，使我国的农业技术水平大大地提高了一步。
    这一运动在全国范围内迅速地发展起来，并不是偶然的现象，而是有着深刻的社会历史原因的。农业生产的合作化，使广大农民群众不再需要为自己一小片土地和庄稼的命运而终日忧虑，长年奔忙了。人们都当作大生产中的一员出现，有着较为细密的分工，而又时常进行大规模的集体生产。在这种情况下，一项工具的改革能够在生产中发挥极大的作用，而人们又有机会有可能集中精力来研究某一项或几项改革，再加上党和人民政府的积极领导和支持，使原来不敢想不敢干的人们都大胆地想、大胆地干起来了。这就是群众性工具改革运动的时代背景。
    目前的农具改革运动是一个具有伟大革命意义的群众运动，是我国农业技术革命的萌芽。我国农业的长期落后，除了社会政治原因以外，重要的原因之一是农业技术长期以来停留在很低的水平上。我国农民所使用的农具，几百年来以至一千多年以来都没有很大改进。要大大发展我国的农业生产，要使我国农业赶上并且超过一切资本主义国家——这是我国人民应有的抱负——，就必须使我国农业现代化，就是说，要把我国农业经济转到现代化大生产的技术基础上，机械化的技术基础上，使农业生产中凡是可以使用机器的通通使用现代化机器，使农业劳动和工业劳动的差别缩小，使农村和城市的差别缩小。这是我国农业技术革命的目标。要达到这个目标，从目前的情况看来，并不是很遥远的事情。在最近一两个月中，全国各地已出现了十八种小型拖拉机，就是有力的证明。那种对农业机械化抱着神秘化的观点是不对的。但是，也应当指出，要实现农业机械化，也不能一步登天。目前现实的也是最迫切的问题就是使农业技术在现有的基础上提高一步，逐步地从改良农具到半机械化，到完全机械化。那种轻视改良农具，坐等拖拉机的想法是不切实际的，危险的。我国目前是改良农具、半机械化（新式畜力农具）和机械化（各种动力的机引农业机器）同时并存的局面，当前应当以改良农具为主。同时尽快地逐步实现半机械化和机械化。当前的改良农具运动，是一个由量变到质变的过程，它的创造越多，品种越繁，范围越广，进步越快，也就更能加速我国农业机械化的早日到来。
    刘少奇同志在参观广东农具改革推广展览会时说：“这样的技术革新运动，像一部车子，已经开动了，永远不会停止，一天不停，一万年不停。”我们必须积极领导这个运动，逐步地实现建立我国现代化农业的伟大的历史任务。
