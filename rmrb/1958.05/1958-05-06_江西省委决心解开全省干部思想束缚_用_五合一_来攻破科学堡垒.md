    Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Determined to Unleash Cadres' Minds, Using "Five-in-One" to Conquer Scientific Fortresses
    (Our reporter Li Lianbin reports) From April 17th to 25th, the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee held its Fifth Fifth (Enlarged) Plenary Session, discussing scientific work. The meeting proposed that in order to welcome the upcoming technological revolution and cultural revolution, it was decided to launch a massive, mass-based scientific and technological work campaign from top to bottom and bottom to top. A series of scientific research institutions and organizations of various forms and categories will be established from the province, administrative offices, special commissioner's offices, and counties to farms and agricultural cooperatives. The Provincial People's Committee officially passed a resolution on the establishment of provincial scientific research branches at its 38th meeting on April 29th. Preparations are now underway, and it was decided to establish a comprehensive university, an industrial college, a water conservancy college, and a ceramics college using the "hat-wearing" method, and to run amateur universities. Administrative offices, special commissioner's offices, and reclamation farms for transferred cadres will generally establish scientific research branches, run some urgently needed specialized schools and various amateur science and technology schools, and agricultural cooperatives will establish science and technology dissemination stations and night schools, and universally run private middle schools, private primary schools, and literacy night schools. In this way, Jiangxi Province can establish a strong scientific research team throughout the province, build a provincial scientific research network, and create favorable conditions for the technological revolution and cultural revolution.
    Party and government leaders in Jiangxi Province analyzed the objective situation since the Great Leap Forward. In view of the fact that the development of science, technology, and culture has become an urgent demand for accelerating socialist construction and the broad masses, in this pressing situation, they had to raise scientific, technological, and cultural work to an important agenda item for leadership. The province currently has more than 12,000 scientific and technical personnel (including grassroots personnel). After the rectification campaign, everyone's socialist consciousness has greatly improved, and being both red and expert, red and deeply expert, has become a common requirement for scientific and technical personnel. The key now lies in overcoming inferiority complexes, thoroughly liberating thought, breaking down superstitions, dispelling the mysterious view of science and technology, and marching towards the fortress of science and technology with revolutionary spirit. Therefore, the Provincial Party Committee requires cadres and all scientific and technical personnel to free themselves from the shackles of old traditional concepts, resolutely overcome the erroneous thinking of "qualification theory," "condition theory," and blindly pursuing "formalization" and "modernization," criticize the bourgeois view of only paying attention to young knowledge and neglecting mass practice, and with a revolutionary spirit, establish the view of close integration of professional workers and the broad masses, and enhance their confidence and ambition to make corresponding contributions in the field of science and technology.
    The Provincial Party Committee believes that scientific, technological, and cultural work must serve production, serve the acceleration of socialist construction, and serve the implementation of the Party's general line. These tasks should focus on serving current production and also appropriately take into account the needs of production development; focus on solving key problems in production and also appropriately take into account general problems; and at the same time, must implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement.
    In order to implement the above policies, the Provincial Party Committee focused on proposing a "five-in-one" method. That is, combining work, study, scientific research, teaching, and writing. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this is an important measure to cultivate a large army of working-class intellectuals quickly, efficiently, and economically, and to achieve brilliant results in scientific and technological research; it is an effective method for implementing the fundamental principles of combining theory and practice, combining scientific research and practical production, and combining scientific and technical personnel and the masses. It requires all cadres and all scientific and technical personnel to adopt the "five-in-one" method to carry out scientific and technological and cultural work. The Provincial Party Committee believes that the "five-in-one" method can prevent both dogmatism and empiricism. Scientific research work has a basis in reality and practice, which makes it easier to achieve results. Actual and practical work directly guided by science and technology can also develop more rapidly. The "five-in-one" method can also cultivate thousands of teachers in a short period of time. The universities, amateur universities, amateur technical schools, and private middle schools planned to be established by the province and various regions all decided not to equip many full-time teachers according to the requirements of the general line, but to prepare to adopt the "five-in-one" method on a large scale, with existing cadres and scientific and technical personnel respectively undertaking the teaching of various subjects.
    In order to widely carry out scientific, technological, and cultural work, the Provincial Party Committee plans to hold a provincial scientific research work conference in July, to summarize the scientific research achievements of the past few years, hold a performance exhibition, exchange research experience, and formulate a scientific research plan for 1958 and a long-term plan. At present, all parts of the province are actively carrying out extensive publicity work. On April 29th, the Provincial Party Committee convened a meeting of more than 1,600 scientific workers, calling on everyone to immediately and extensively carry out scientific research in various fields, and to welcome the convening of the provincial scientific research work conference in July with active practical actions and concrete scientific research results.

    江西省委决心解开全省干部思想束缚
    用“五合一”来攻破科学堡垒
    本报讯　记者李连斌报道：从4月17日到25日中共江西省委举行了第五届第五次（扩大）会议，讨论了科学工作。会议提出：为了迎接即将到来的技术革命和文化革命，决定自上而下自下而上地开展规模壮阔的群众性的科学技术工作。从省、行署、专署、县到农场、农业社将建立一系列的各种形式和各种类别的科学研究机构和组织。省人民委员会4月29日第三十八次会议已正式通过建立省科学研究分院，现正着手进行筹备工作，并决定用“带帽子”的办法成立一所综合大学、成立一所工业学院、一所水利学院、一所陶瓷学院，举办业余大学。行署、专署、下放干部垦殖场将普遍设立科学研究分支机构，并举办某些急需的专科学校和各种业余科学技术学校，农业社将建立科学技术传授站和夜校，普遍兴办民办中学、民办小学和扫盲夜校。这样，江西省就可在全省范围内建立起一支强大的科学研究队伍，建成一个全省性的科学研究网，将为技术革命和文化革命创造良好条件。
    江西省党政领导分析了大跃进以来的客观形势，鉴于科学技术、文化的发展已成为加速社会主义建设和广大群众的迫切要求，在这种形势逼人的情况下，不能不把科学、技术、文化工作提高到领导的重要议事日程上来。全省现有科学技术人员（包括基层人员）一万二千多名，经过整风，大家的社会主义觉悟有了很大的提高，又红又专、红透专深也已经成为科技人员的普遍要求。现在关键就在于克服自卑观点，彻底解放思想、破除迷信、打消对科学技术的神秘观点，以革命精神向科学技术堡垒进军。因此省委要求干部和一切科学技术人员必须从旧的传统观念的束缚下解放出来，坚决克服“资格论”“条件论”和盲目追求“正规化”“现代化”等等的错误思想，批判只注意青年知识而轻视群众实践的资产阶级观点，要以革命精神，树立专业工作者和广大群众密切结合的依靠群众的观点，增强自己在科学技术领域内一定能够做出相应贡献的信心和志气。
    省委认为科学技术文化工作，必须为生产服务，为加速社会主义建设服务，为贯彻实现党的总路线服务。这些工作应该以为当前生产服务为主也要适当照顾生产发展的需要；以解决生产中的关键性问题为主也要适当照顾一般性的问题；同时必须贯彻执行普及和提高相结合的方针。
    为了贯彻执行上述方针，省委着重提出了一项“五合一”的方法。就是把工作、学习、科学研究、讲授和写作五者结合起来。省委认为这是多快好省地培养工人阶级知识分子大军、取得科学技术研究辉煌成果的一项重要措施；是贯彻执行理论和实践相结合、科学研究和现实生产相结合、科学技术人员和群众相结合等根本原则的有效方法。要求所有的干部和一切科学技术人员都采取“五合一”的办法进行科学技术和文化工作。省委认为“五合一”的方法既可防止教条主义，又可避免经验主义，科学研究工作有实际和实践作依据就容易取得成就，实际和实践直接受到科学技术的指导也就更能迅速发展。“五合一”的方法并可以在短时期内培养出成千上万的教员，省和各地区计划兴办的大学、业余大学、业余技术学校和民办中学等，根据总路线的要求，都决定不配备多少专职教员，而准备大量地采用“五合一”的办法由现有的干部和科技人员分别担任各科教学。
    为了广泛开展科学技术和文化工作，省委计划7月份召开全省科学研究工作会议，总结几年来的科学研究成果，举办实绩展览会，交流研究经验，制订1958年的科学研究规划和远景规划。现全省各地正积极进行广泛的宣传工作。4月29日省委召开一千六百多名科学工作者的会议，号召大家立即广泛地开展各方面的科学研究工作，以积极的实际行动和具体的科学研究成果来迎接7月全省科学研究工作会议的召开。
