Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, 28th. Since Lanzhou City implemented the policy of simultaneously developing large-scale industries alongside medium and small-scale industries, a new leap forward situation has emerged in industrial construction. Currently, some large factories in the Lanzhou area are accelerating their construction, with some set to commence production ahead of schedule. Among the thirty-one medium-sized factories newly built and expanded at the city level this year, some will soon be put into production. More than one hundred and seventy small factories run by various districts have already begun production.

In the past, many cadres in Lanzhou City lacked a comprehensive understanding of building a socialist industrial city, focusing only on newly built large factories while neglecting medium and small-scale industries. They also considered existing factories as "rotten messes, with rotten machines, and no future." Under the influence of this thinking, the development of local industry in Lanzhou City was very slow for several years. As a result, the miscellaneous equipment needed by Lanzhou's large industries had to be ordered from thousands of miles away, the countryside could not obtain more production materials from Lanzhou City, and many daily necessities for urban and rural people had to be brought in from Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. During the rectification movement, especially at the CPC Lanzhou Municipal Congress held in April this year, the erroneous line of running industries in the past was criticized in a concentrated manner through debates, on-site meetings, and exhibitions. It was pointed out that as a socialist new-type industrial city, it is necessary not only to focus on developing large industries equipped with the latest technology but also to vigorously develop medium and small-scale industries and handicraft factories equipped with ordinary technology. Existing factories should be transformed to tap their production potential, achieving substance, combining large, medium, and small enterprises, and achieving comprehensive prosperity.

After Lanzhou City corrected its direction in running industries, it constructed factories according to this principle. First, some of the medium and small-scale factories built this year use the edge materials, waste materials, and by-products of large industries as raw materials, such as the recycled steel plant with an annual output of 6,000 tons of steel, using metal scraps and waste steel as raw materials, and the fly ash products plant with an annual output of 40,000 tons of lightweight materials, using coal ash and cinder as raw materials. Some medium and small-scale factories directly serve large factories, such as paper bag factories. Existing small factories have also been organized to cooperate with large factories to manufacture production equipment such as nitrogen fertilizer, oil refining, power generation, machine tools, tractors, and gas engines. Some of the parts and components required by large industries have also been manufactured locally through collaboration with these small factories. Second, building medium and small-scale factories that serve agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people, such as nitrogen fertilizer plants, ball bearing plants, and cotton spinning and knitting factories. Third, new medium and small-scale factories are combined with existing factories. For example, after building paper box and quartz powder factories this year, the paper boxes needed by Lanzhou's cigarette and ink factories no longer need to be transported from other places, and the quartz powder needed by the glass factory no longer needs to be transferred from other places.

In order to give full play to the enthusiasm of various regions in running industries, Lanzhou City has put forward the slogans of "communes running factories," "street offices running factories," and "districts running factories." In addition to strengthening its leadership over large central factories, the city focuses on running medium-sized factories. Small factories run by districts mainly serve agricultural production and the lives of urban and rural people. Small factories run by street offices and suburban agricultural cooperatives are, in principle, for self-production and self-use.

In order to run industries well, Lanzhou City has adjusted its industrial leadership. The secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee and various district committees are in charge of running industries. The Municipal People's Committee is about to establish light and heavy industry bureaus, and each district will establish an industrial section. The city has already transferred more than 100 cadres at the level of ministers, bureau directors, section chiefs, and engineering technicians to prepare for the establishment of medium-sized factories, and is continuing to transfer cadres.

### 大中小相结合，全面繁荣  兰州工业建设有骨有肉

    大中小相结合，全面繁荣
    兰州工业建设有骨有肉
    新华社兰州28日电　兰州市实行大型工业和中、小型工业同时并举的方针以后，工业建设出现了新的跃进局面。目前，兰州地区一些大工厂正在加快速度兴建，有的要提前投入生产；市级今年新建和扩建的三十一个中型工厂，有的将要在最近投入生产；各区办的小型工厂投入生产的已有一百七十多个。
    兰州市的不少干部过去对于建设社会主义工业城市缺乏全面理解，只看重一些新建的大工厂，忽视中、小型工业，对于旧有的工厂也认为是“烂摊子，烂机器，没奔头”。在这种思想支配下，几年来兰州市的地方工业发展很慢，因此兰州市大工业所需要的零星器材不得不到几千里外去订制，农村不能从兰州市得到较多的生产资料，城乡人民的生活用品很多都要从上海、天津等地调来。在整风运动中，特别是在今年4月召开的中共兰州市代表大会上，通过大辩论、开现场会议、展览会等方式，集中地批判了过去办工业的错误路线，指出作为社会主义新型工业城市，不但要着重发展最新技术装备起来的大工业，还要大办普通技术装备的中、小型工业和手工业工厂；对旧有厂子要进行改造，挖掘生产潜力，做到有骨有肉，大、中、小相结合，全面繁荣。
    兰州市端正了办工业的方向以后，就按照这个原则来建设工厂。第一、今年建设的一批中、小型工厂，有些是利用大工业的边材、废料、副产品作原料的，如利用大工业金属切屑和废钢铁做原料、年产六千吨钢的再生钢厂，利用煤灰煤渣做原料、年产四万吨轻体材料的炉灰制品厂。有些中小型工厂是为大工厂直接服务的，如纸袋厂等。旧有的小工厂也已组织起来，同大工厂协作制造氮肥、炼油、发电、机床、拖拉机、煤气机等生产设备。大工业所需的一些配件，也已改由这些小厂就地协作制造。第二、建设为农业生产、为城乡人民生活服务的中、小型工厂，如氮肥厂、滚珠轴承厂、棉纺织针织厂等。第三、新建中、小型工厂和旧有工厂相结合，如今年建设纸箱、石英粉等工厂以后，兰州的卷烟、墨水等厂需要的纸箱就不必再从外地运来，玻璃厂所需的石英粉也不必从外地调运了。
    为了充分发挥各地办工业的积极性，兰州市已提出社社办工厂、街道办工厂、区区办工厂的口号。市级除加强对中央大工厂的领导外，着重举办中型工厂；区办小型工厂，主要为农业生产服务，为城乡人民生活服务；街道和郊区农业社办的小工厂，原则上是自产自用。
    为了办好工业，兰州市已经调整了工业领导力量，中共市委和各区委都是书记挂帅办工业。市人民委员会将要成立轻、重工业局，各区成立工业科。市里已经调出部长、局长、科长级干部和工程技术人员等一百多人，专门筹办中型工厂，现在还在继续抽调干部中。
