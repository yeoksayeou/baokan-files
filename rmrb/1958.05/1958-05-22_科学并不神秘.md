Science and technology originate from social practice and material production, and are not profound, mysterious, or unattainable. A large number of inventions and creations come not from experts and scholars, but from workers in all walks of life.

In the agricultural product processing hall of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, a light and ingenious machine was praised by the audience. This machine can not only grate sweet potato shreds, cut sweet potato slices, grind sweet potato flour, and chop pig feed, but also thresh rice, wheat, sorghum, and pick peanuts. Therefore, its name is the Eight-Purpose Machine. The inventor of this ingenious machine, people might think, must be a knowledgeable engineer or mechanical expert. Wrong. This inventor is an ordinary young farmer named Cao Wentao who only attended four years of primary school. Last August, with the support of the Party, he spent fifteen days creating this machine. Before that, he also created a water lifting machine, a lime spreader for paddy fields, a suction-pressure water pump, a two-way harrow, a bamboo tube sprayer, an animal-powered tea kneading machine, and a rice combined transplanter.

Primary school level should be considered not much knowledge. Some people precisely because they "have no knowledge," dare not think big or far, and dare not expect to invent and create anything. With such self-abasement, their creativity slowly disappears. Cao Wentao, this young farmer, is not like this. He has no mysterious concept of knowledge and learning. He learns whatever he needs. For the principles he learns, he conducts experiments with real objects to gain a thorough understanding, never swallowing them whole or being careless. In this way, this young farmer without much knowledge has now become an inventor with considerable scientific knowledge.

In our liberated motherland, such examples are emerging endlessly and becoming more and more numerous. Li Shimei, a "native expert" in termite control in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, is a rural youth without much knowledge, having only attended the first year of junior high school, but the control methods he has researched are more effective than international standards and more perfect than the methods researched by specialized scientists. This scientific method, which does not rely solely on research from books and laboratories, but comes from practice alongside research, has broken the superstition of academic research. Now he is a member of the Entomological Society.

Wang Baojing, the director of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi Province, is only twenty-seven years old this year, and he does not consider science and technology to be mysterious, profound, or unattainable. He thinks, since everything is made by people, why can university professors do it, and why can't farmers learn it since they are also human beings? He personally saw that the people who did the actual operations in the agricultural college's experiments were ordinary farmers under the guidance of professors, which further strengthened his confidence. In this way, in three years, he has achieved great results in cultivating wheat, corn, cotton, and other crop varieties, and has also trained twenty-five cooperative members with certain scientific and technical knowledge. Now, he is a special researcher at the Shaanxi Agricultural Science Research Institute.

These examples show the infinite wisdom and creativity of the liberated Chinese people, and also show another problem, that is, science is not mysterious and that everyone can learn and master it. The key lies in the liberation of people's minds. That is to say, do not be superstitious; do not think that only experts who have received higher education, or people who have obtained some kind of degree, can engage in science and make inventions. All our cadres and masses must believe, like Wang Baojing, that they are exactly the same as those "knowledgeable" people, lacking neither hands nor feet, and even less lacking intelligence. Whatever others can learn through labor, they can certainly learn through labor. If they put in more effort than others, then they can learn even more than others. People often say "the able are burdened with more work," and we can say the opposite: "those who labor are more able." "Labor" means studying hard, and studying hard will surely lead to knowledge, to mastering scientific and technical knowledge, and to the possibility of becoming a scientific expert.

Historical facts prove that the invention of science and technology emerges with the development of production and the needs of production. The emergence of all sciences is inseparable from social practice and the needs of material production. Historically, most of the important inventors at home and abroad came from the oppressed classes, that is to say, from those people who were in lower social positions, younger, with less knowledge, with poorer conditions, who were always looked down upon at the beginning, and even suffered blows and torment. In our already liberated motherland, in the Chinese people who are building socialism with full force, many mass inventors and creators have emerged. These facts will be a great encouragement to workers, peasants, petty intellectuals, and new and old cadres, encouraging them to get rid of their inferiority complexes, cut away their self-abasement, break superstitions, and invigorate the fearless creative spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do. If we break superstitions in science and technology and expose the mysterious viewpoints, the wisdom and talent of the people will emit infinite power like a split atomic nucleus, and more mass inventors and creators will inevitably emerge, and the high tide of our country's technological revolution and cultural revolution will soon arrive.

### 科学并不神秘

    科学并不神秘
    科学技术来源于社会实践和物质生产，并不是什么深奥神秘、高不可攀的东西。大量的发明创造不是专家学者，而是各行各业的劳动者。
    在全国农具展览会的农产品加工馆里，有一部轻便灵巧的机器受到观众的称赞。这部机器既能刨薯丝、切薯片、磨薯粉、铡猪草，又能打稻、打麦、打高粱，摘花生。所以它的名字叫做八用机。发明这部精巧机器的，人们也许以为一定是个什么有学问的工程师或者机械专家。错了。这个发明家，是一个仅仅读过四年初级小学的普通青年农民，名叫曹文韬。去年8月，他在党的支持下用十五天的时间创制成功了这部机器。在这以前，他还创造了升水机、水田撒石灰器、吸压式抽水筒、两用耙、竹筒喷雾器、畜力揉茶机和水稻联合插秧机。
    初小程度，应当算是没有多大学问的了。有人也正是因为自己“没有学问”，也就不敢往远处大处想，不敢指望要发明和创造什么。这样妄自菲薄，他们的创造力就慢慢地消失了。曹文韬这个青年农民不是这样。他对于知识和学问没有神秘观念。他需要什么，他就来学什么。对于学到的原理，他都要拿实物来做试验，求得彻底了解，决不囫囵吞枣，马虎了事。就这样，这个没有多大学问的青年农民现在成了具有相当科学知识的发明家。
    在我们解放了的祖国，这样的例子是层出不穷，越来越多了。广东省新会县防治白蚂蚁的“土专家”李始美，是一个没有多大学问的农村青年，只上过初中一年，但是研究出来的防治方法的效果，已经超过了国际水平，比专门科学家们研究出来的方法还完善。这种不是单纯从书本、从实验室作研究，而是从边研究边实践来的科学方法，打破了学院式研究的迷信。现在他已经是昆虫学会的会员了。
    陕西省醴泉县烽火农业社主任王保京，今年才二十七岁，对于科学技术并不认为是什么神秘深奥、高不可攀的东西。他想的是，既然都是人作的，为什么大学教授能做，同样是人，农民就无法学会呢？他亲眼看到农学院做试验实际操作的人，就是教授指导下的普通农民，更坚定了他的信心。就这样，他在三年里在培育小麦、玉米、棉花等作物品种方面取得了很大成绩，还培养了具有一定科学技术知识的社员二十五人。现在，他已经是陕西农业科学研究所的特约研究员。
    这些事例，可以看到解放了的中国人民的无穷无尽的智慧和创造力，也可以看到另外一个问题，就是科学并没有什么神秘，它是人人都可以学到和掌握到的。关键在于人们思想的解放。就是说，不要迷信；不要以为只有受过高等教育的专家，或者得过什么学位的人才能搞科学，搞发明。所有我们的干部和群众都要像王保京一样地相信，自己是同那些“有学问”的人一模一样的，既不缺少手脚，更不缺少智慧。凡是别人经过劳动可以学到的，自己经过劳动也一定可以学到。如果自己比别人多花了力气，那就可以学到比别人更多的东西。人们常说“能者多劳”，我们可以反过来说：“劳者多能。”“劳”就是努力学习，努力学习就一定会有学问，会掌握科学技术知识，就可能成为科学专家。
    历史的事实证明，科学技术的发明，随着生产的发展、生产的需要而出现，各门科学的产生，无一不是同社会实践和物质生产的需要密不可分的。历史上的中外重要发明家大多出于被压迫阶级，即是说，出于那些社会地位较低，年纪较轻，学问较少，条件较差，在开始时总是被人看不起，甚至受打击受折磨的那些人。在已经解放了的我们祖国，在万马奔腾地建设着社会主义的我国人民，已经涌现出了不少群众的发明创造者，这些事实，对于工人、农民、小知识分子和新老干部将是一个极大的鼓舞，鼓舞他们打掉自卑感，砍去妄自菲薄，破除迷信，振奋敢想敢说敢做的大无畏创造精神。在科学技术问题上破除了迷信，揭穿了神秘观点，人民的聪明才智就会像分裂了的原子核一样，发出无穷的力量，必然会涌现出更多群众发明创造者，我国的技术革命和文化革命的高潮就会很快到来。
