Xinhua News Agency, May 7th. (TASS Ankara, May 6th dispatch): The Republican People's Party parliamentary group, Turkey's largest opposition party, issued a communique strongly criticizing the government for plunging the national economy into difficulties.

　　The communique stated that, with the exception of an extremely limited few, the majority of the Turkish people are in dire economic straits. The communique pointed out that Turkey's current "living conditions are unbearable, goods are out of stock, and prices are soaring." The communique went on to say that the Democratic Party government shouts every year that "difficulties are about to end" and that the following year "will guarantee abundance and prosperity." But every guarantee has failed to materialize. The communique emphasized that the people no longer believe the promises of "this small group of politicians," but the government is still trying every means to divert the people's attention from economic problems.

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 7th. (TASS Tel Aviv, May 6th dispatch): According to Israeli newspapers, unemployment continues to increase in many parts of Israel, and residents are experiencing hardship. According to materials from the Government Bureau of Statistics, the total number of unemployed in Israel in November 1957 was about 50,000, and the number of partially unemployed was more than 110,000, accounting for 7% and 16% of the total labor force, respectively.

　　"People's Voice" wrote that, if the families of these unemployed are added, the total number of people struggling on the brink of starvation and semi-starvation is 453,000. The newspaper said that, in addition, 30,000 households (about 150,000 people) living in new reclamation areas should be added. These people often have no work, and in the words of Israeli Knesset member Dayan, often have "not a piece of bread or a glass of milk on the table."

　　According to newspaper reports, on May 4th and 5th, unemployed people in many towns and villages in the Negev region held demonstrations. According to "The Jerusalem Post," the demonstrators "demanded bread and work." The police arrested them.

    土耳其和以色列人民生活陷于困境
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社安卡拉6日讯：土耳其最大的反对党共和人民党议会党团发表公报，猛烈抨击政府使国家经济陷于困境。
    公报说，除了极其有限的一部分人以外，大多数的土耳其人民都处于经济困难的窘境中。公报指出，土耳其目前的“生活条件无法忍受，商品脱销，物价高涨”。公报接着说，民主党政府每年都叫嚷“困难即将结束”，下一年“将保证丰裕富足”。但是每一次保证都没有实现。公报强调说，现在人民都不相信“这一小撮政治家”的诺言了，但是政府还千方百计地转移人民对经济问题的注意。
    新华社7日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫6日讯：据以色列报纸报道，以色列许多地区失业人数继续增加，居民生活困难。根据政府统计局的材料，1957年11月份以色列的全失业人数约有五万人，半失业人数十一万多人，分别占有劳动能力的总人数的7％和16％。
    “人民呼声报”写道，这样，如果再加上这些失业者的家属，那末挣扎在饥饿和半饥饿线上的总人数就有四十五万三千人。报纸说，此外，还应该加上居住在新农垦区的三万户人家（约有十五万人）。这些人经常没有工作，用以色列议会议员代扬的话来说，经常是“桌上没有一片面包，没有一杯牛奶”。
    据报纸报道，5月4日和5日，尼加夫地区许多村镇的失业者举行了示威游行。据“耶路撒冷邮报”报道，游行者“要求面包和工作”。警察对他们进行了逮捕。
