Short Commentary

    Since last autumn, most parts of Hebei Province have not had a thorough rain for more than 270 days. The severity of the drought during this period is unprecedented in the last thirty years. If this were in the old days, such a severe drought would inevitably have caused a vast disaster with barren lands stretching for miles. However, in today's socialist era, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the organized farmers will never bow to drought, and will never allow drought to cause a huge disaster! For months, the farmers of Hebei Province, under the strong leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, have waged a heroic struggle against the drought. Their slogan is: "Sow good seeds even without rain, and ensure a good harvest even with drought!" This fully demonstrates the heroic spirit of the people of Hebei in overcoming natural disasters. In the face of severe drought, 20 million mu of wheat fields in the province have been irrigated, a figure several times higher than in previous years. The province has completed drought-resistant sowing on more than 54 million mu of land, completing 64% of the spring sowing task. Such great achievements in a year of severe drought are a miracle worthy of praise.
    In the struggle against drought, the most touching and valuable thing is the high tide of the communist spirit of the 40 million people of Hebei Province. All parts of the province broke down the boundaries between townships and counties, pooled their wisdom and efforts, and provided mutual support in terms of labor and materials from afar. In terms of water use, the upstream and downstream areas gave way to each other, allowing many difficulties that were impossible to overcome in the old days to be overcome smoothly, and many things that were impossible to do in the old days to be done smoothly. The new social and economic system has brought about extremely profound changes in the mental outlook of the people, and the change in the mental outlook of the people has in turn promoted social and economic development. This dialectical law of development is seen here more clearly than ever.
    A few days ago, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency meeting in Beijing. Given that the drought has not been relieved, the meeting proposed: continue to exert great efforts, strive for the upstream, launch a larger-scale mass movement, and use all efforts to expand the province's irrigated area from the current 60 million mu to 100 million mu, achieve water conservancy throughout the province, completely overwhelm the severe drought, ensure a bumper harvest, and achieve the leap forward plan. This is the fearless style of communism. We communists have never bowed our heads before any enemy. Whether it is a class enemy or an enemy of nature, we must overwhelm them and crush them step by step. We communists must be good at creating and using favorable conditions, and we must also be good at transforming bad conditions into their opposite, turning bad things into good things. Hebei Province has suffered a severe drought that has not been seen in thirty years, which is certainly a bad thing, and a very bad thing. However, inspiring the masses with the slogan of completely overwhelming the severe drought, and leading the masses to launch a water conservancy construction movement on a larger scale than in the past few months, and achieving water conservancy ahead of schedule, will not only overcome this year's severe drought, but also fundamentally eliminate the threat of drought in the future. In this way, the bad thing of drought can be turned into a good thing. This is the style that revolutionaries should have.
    Yesterday, some rain fell in various parts of Hebei, and where planting is possible, immediate organization of emergency planting should be undertaken. Other areas still need to continue to fight drought. Regardless of whether there is rain or not, the movement to build water conservancy projects should be actively carried out, seizing all opportunities. Because this is the way to fundamentally cure drought, and it is a great revolution for people against nature. We must not relax our efforts because of temporary rain. We must know that even if there is a thorough rain this time, it is still possible to suffer from drought this year. Even if this year passes, it is still possible to suffer from drought next year and the year after. Therefore, we should take advantage of the victory and continue to advance, carry out the struggle to the end, and obtain a reliable guarantee to overcome all droughts.
    The struggle of the people of Hebei Province against nature is by no means isolated. Behind the 40 million people of Hebei Province, there is the support of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government and the people of the whole country. We believe that the struggle of the people of Hebei Province will surely achieve final victory, and we wish them victory in advance!

### 河北人民的英雄气概

    河北人民的英雄气概
    去年秋季以来，河北省大部地区二百七十多天没有下透雨。这一期间内旱象的严重，为三十年来所未有。如果是在旧时代，这样的大旱必然造成赤地千里的巨大灾难。但是，在今天的社会主义时代，在共产党领导下，组织起来的农民却决不向干旱低头，决不容许干旱酿成巨大的灾难！几个月来，河北省农民在各级党委和政府的坚强领导下，向干旱进行了英勇的斗争。他们的口号是：“无雨也要播好种，干旱也要保丰收！”这充分表现了河北人民战胜自然灾害的英雄气概。在大旱的情况下，全省有二千万亩麦田得到了灌溉，这个数字超过了往年好几倍。全省已完成五千四百多万亩的抗旱播种，完成了春播任务的64％。在大旱之年能获得这样大的成绩，是值得歌颂的奇迹。
    在向干旱作斗争中，最感人、最可贵的是河北省四千万人民的共产主义精神的高涨。全省各地打破乡界和县界，群策群力，在劳力和物资方面远道互相支援，在用水方面上下游互让互济，使旧时代许多无法克服的困难顺利地克服了，使旧时代许多无法做到的事情顺利地做到了。新的社会经济制度使人民群众的精神面貌发生了极其深刻的变化，而人民的精神面貌的改变又反转来促进社会经济的发展。这种辩证的发展规律，在这里看得再清楚没有了。
    几天以前，中共河北省委在北京召开的紧急会议，鉴于大旱尚未解除，会议提出：继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，掀起规模更大的群众运动，用尽一切努力，把全省灌溉面积由目前的六千万亩扩大到一亿亩，实现全省水利化，彻底压倒大旱，保证丰收，实现跃进计划。这是共产主义的大无畏的风格。我们共产党人从来没有在任何敌人面前低过头。不论是对于阶级敌人或是对于自然界的敌人，我们都要一步一步地压倒他们，粉碎他们。我们共产党人固然要善于创造和运用有利的条件，并且要善于把这样那样的坏条件转变为它们的反面，变坏事为好事。河北省遭受了三十年所没有的大旱，这当然是坏事，而且是一件很大的坏事。但是，以彻底压倒大旱的口号激励群众的斗志，领导群众掀起一次比过去几个月更大规模的兴修水利运动，提前实现水利化，这就不但能战胜今年的大旱，而且能从根本上解除今后干旱的威胁。这样，大旱这件坏事就能变成好事。这是革命派应有的风格。
    昨天河北各地落了一些雨，有一些地方可以下种的应当马上组织抢种。其他地方仍然需要继续抗旱。不管有雨或无雨地区，兴修水利的运动都应当抓紧一切机会来积极进行。因为这是根治旱灾的道路，是人们对自然界一场大革命。切不可以因为暂时落雨而放松努力。要知道，即使这次下了透雨，今年也还是可能遭受干旱。今年过去了，明年后年也还是可能遭受干旱。所以应该乘胜续进，把斗争进行到底，取得战胜一切干旱的可靠保证。
    河北省人民对自然界所作的斗争，决不孤立。在河北省四千万人民的背后，有着党中央、中央人民政府和全国人民的支援。我们相信，河北省人民的斗争一定能取得最后胜利，我们预祝他们的胜利！
