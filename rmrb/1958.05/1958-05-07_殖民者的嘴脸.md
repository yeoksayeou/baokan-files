    The Ugly Face of the Colonialists
    Recently, the American Assembly, a notorious reactionary organization in the United States, held a four-day meeting to discuss the relationship between the United States and Africa. One of the meeting's reports advocated that the United States should affirm "the belief in racial equality in all countries," and believed that "Africans need more participation in government in order to transition to a society where skin color is politically irrelevant."
    That sounds nice, but the report then revealed its true purpose. It said: "Premature independence in multi-racial areas may hinder the development of democratic societies." In this way, the United States revealed its full-fledged racial discrimination and the ugly face of the colonialists.

    殖民者的嘴脸
    最近，美国一个恶名昭著的反动团体——美国人大会，开会四天讨论了美国和非洲之间关系的问题，会议一项报告主张：美国应该肯定“在所有的国家中一切种族平等的信念”，认为需要“非洲人更多地参加政府，以便过渡到肤色在政治上是无关紧要的社会”。
    话说得蛮好听，不过报告跟着就道出了真正的目的。它说：“多种族地区过早地独立，可能妨碍民主社会的发展。”这样，美国那副十足的种族歧视和殖民主义者的嘴脸就露出来了。
