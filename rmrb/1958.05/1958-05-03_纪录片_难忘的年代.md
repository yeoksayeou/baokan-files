    This is a valuable historical documentary. It records the major historical events in the Soviet national life from 1917 to today, such as how people built factories on wasteland in the early days of construction, how workers rushed to the countryside during the period of agricultural collectivization, the construction achievements before the Soviet Patriotic War, and the frenzied destruction of the fascists during the Patriotic War, etc., leaving an unforgettable impression after watching.

    纪录片“难忘的年代”
    这是一部珍贵的历史文献纪录片。它纪录了从1917年到今天的苏联国家生活中的重大历史事件，例如在建设初期人们怎样在荒地上建设工厂，工人们如何在实现农业集体化时期奔赴农村，苏联卫国战争以前的建设成就和卫国战争期间法西斯的疯狂破坏等等，看后给人留下难忘的印象。
    从影片中，人们可以看到伟大列宁生前的活动以及斯维尔德洛夫、斯大林、加里宁、捷尔任斯基、克鲁普斯卡亚、基洛夫等的真实形象。　（江）
