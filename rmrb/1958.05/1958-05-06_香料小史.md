    A Brief History of Spices
  　Gu Zheng
    The Greek poet Homer, in his epic "The Iliad," described how people, when burying a hero, would smear his wounds with spices that had been treasured for many years; the ancient Egyptians also widely used various balms when preserving mummies, as they already knew the antiseptic properties of spices.
    In China, the ancients often used fragrance and foulness as a metaphor for good and evil. In Qu Yuan's "Li Sao," orchids and sweet herbs are often used to symbolize virtuous men, while dung and wormwood are used to symbolize petty men.
    Initially, humans only recognized fragrant herbs such as orchids, peppercorns, and cassia. Later, they learned to extract plant-based spices from the flowers, seeds, roots, stems, and leaves of plants, or to utilize natural resins. Then, they gradually learned to obtain animal-based spices such as musk, civet, castoreum, and ambergris. Obtaining spices from natural flora and fauna is not an easy task: musk deer, civets, and beavers are very rare animals; and extracting spices from plants also requires great effort—in the past, obtaining a few ounces of rose oil required steaming tens of thousands of roses. However, in modern times, chemists and technicians have artificially created many kinds of spices. They can be produced in large quantities, are inexpensive, and smell as pleasant as cloves, violets, and roses.
    Spices are organic substances that can emit fragrance at room temperature, generally hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones, phenols, etc. However, I've heard that there is also an organic substance called indole, which originally has a rather unpleasant fecal odor, but when immersed in a very dilute solution, it instead carries a floral fragrance. Blending many kinds of spices together can often compensate for the shortcomings of a monotonous fragrance, making people feel very harmonious, but if the combination is improper, it can instead make people feel unpleasant.
    In capitalist countries, the big bosses of the cosmetics industry strictly maintain the secrecy of their manufacturers' compound spice formulas. Many technicians, relying on their noses, can distinguish countless kinds of spices and can formulate various brand-name perfumes and cosmetics. Because they are employed by capitalists (or, to put it more correctly, their noses are employed), there is no more dangerous accident for them than catching a cold. Thus, in order to survive in capitalist society, they can only go to insurance companies to insure their cherished noses.
    Spices are already indispensable in people's lives. Just imagine, candies, sodas, pastries, tobacco... which one can do without spices? When we cook, we especially like to add some fennel, star anise, cinnamon, etc. This is because spices can stimulate the secretion of salivary glands and gastric glands, causing people to have a good impression of food, and they also aid digestion. In addition, aren't soap, tooth powder, and toothpaste all contain spices? They can not only give people a cool feeling in the mouth or on the skin, but also have the effect of disinfecting and sterilizing. In Chinese medical books, it is also recorded that musk is used to treat spasms and infantile convulsions; and civet and castoreum are used as sedatives for the nervous system. Now, peppermint oil is also widely used in medicine, such as in peppermint lozenges and Tiger Balm, while camphor is often used as a cardiotonic. The usefulness of spices to mankind will become more and more extensive with the development of science.

    香料小史
  　古筝
    希腊诗人荷马在史诗“伊里亚特”中描写了人们在安葬一个英雄时，在他的伤口处抹上珍藏多年的香料；古埃及人保存木乃伊时，也广泛地用了各种香膏，那时人们已经知道香料的防腐性能了。
    在中国，古人还常以香臭拟善恶之辨。屈原的离骚中，常以兰蕙杜蘅喻君子，粪壤萧艾喻小人。
    人类一开始也只是先认识兰蕙椒桂等香草，以后才学会从植物的花、种子、根、茎叶中提取植物性香料，或者利用天然的树脂，然后逐渐学会取得麝香、灵猫香、海狸香、龙涎香等动物性香料。从天然动植物中取得香料，可不是一件容易的事：麝、灵猫、海狸等是很稀有的动物；而从植物中取得香料，也真煞费苦心——过去要得几两玫瑰油就需蒸几万朵玫瑰花。但是到近代，化学家和技师用人工方法制成了许多种香料。它们可以大量生产，价格便宜，而且同丁香花、紫罗兰、玫瑰等一样香气宜人。
    香料是在常温下能散发香味的有机物，一般是烃、醇、醋、酮、酚等等，但听说也有一种叫吲哚的有机物，本来颇有一股难闻的粪臭味，但是把它浸在非常稀的溶液里，却反而带花香。许多种香料调合在一起，往往可弥补香味单调的缺点，使人感到非常和谐，但是如果配合不当，反而会使人感到难闻。
    在资本主义国家，化妆品工业的大老板都对自己厂家的复合香料配方采取严格的保密，有不少的技师，靠他们的鼻子可以辨别无数种香料，并能配制各种名牌香水和化妆品。由于他们受资本家雇用（说得正确些，是他们的鼻子受雇用），因此对他们说来，再没有比发生伤风感冒更危险的事故了。这样，为了在资本主义社会中生存，只能去保险公司为他们所爱惜的鼻子保险。
    香料在人们的生活中已经是不可缺少的东西了，试想，糖果、汽水、糕点、烟草……，哪样离得开香料？我们煮菜时，还特别喜欢放些茴香、八角、桂皮等。这就是因为香料可以刺激唾腺和胃腺的分泌，引起人们对食物的好感，又有助消化。此外，香皂、牙粉、牙膏不都含香料吗？它既可使人口腔或皮肤有清凉的感觉，又有消毒杀菌之功，在中国的医书里，还记载用麝香治痉挛、惊风；用灵猫香、海狸香作神经系统的镇静剂。现在，薄荷油也广泛地用在医学上，如作薄荷锭、万金油等，而樟脑又常用作强心剂。香料对人类的用处，将随着科学的发展愈来愈广泛。
