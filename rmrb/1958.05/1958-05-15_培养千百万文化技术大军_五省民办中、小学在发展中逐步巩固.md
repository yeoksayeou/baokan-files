　　Cultivating a Cultural and Technical Army of Millions
    Private Middle and Primary Schools in Five Provinces Gradually Consolidated in Development

    (Reported by our newspaper reporter) In the past month or so, private middle and primary schools in Jiangsu, Henan, Fujian, Hunan, and Shanxi provinces have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. At present, all provinces are actively taking various measures to improve the quality of teachers and consolidate private middle and primary schools.

    Currently, Jiangsu has developed more than 6,000 private agricultural middle schools; Henan has universalized primary school education and developed nearly 10,000 private middle schools; Fujian has basically universalized middle and primary school education, newly establishing more than 2,300 various private middle schools and more than 17,000 private primary schools; Hunan has developed more than 5,300 private agricultural middle schools and more than 20,700 private primary schools, basically achieving a middle school in every township and universalizing primary school education. In order to facilitate students' participation in production and learning, various forms such as half-day system, alternate-day system, morning classes, and evening classes have been adopted, and learning time is arranged according to the agricultural season. Teaching combines politics, production, and life.

    At present, all provinces are actively taking various measures to improve and consolidate private middle and primary schools. The sources of teachers for private middle and primary schools in various provinces are generally middle school graduates, demobilized soldiers, and cadres sent to lower levels who participate in local labor production. In many places, the secretary of the township Party committee concurrently serves as a political teacher, and cadres from the agricultural technology extension station or experienced farmers concurrently teach agricultural technical knowledge courses. Three higher normal colleges in Jiangsu Province have all drawn a group of students from this year's graduates to intern in agricultural middle schools. Fujian is solving the problem of teacher shortage in mountainous areas from all aspects. More than 70% of the province is mountainous, and there is a lack of teacher talent. Party and government leading organs at all levels have organized a large number of qualified educated youths from the more developed coastal areas with more intellectuals, such as Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Jinjiang, to go to Nanping, Fu'an, and other places to support education in mountainous areas. In some remote mountain villages in Yong'an, Jian'ou, and other counties, the method of "one soldier for multiple purposes," such as private school teachers concurrently serving as agricultural society accountants or literacy class teachers, is also used to solve the problem of lack of teachers. All provinces also plan for the long term and solve the problem of teachers for private schools from more aspects. This year, seven special districts in Henan will each run a higher normal college, and each county and city will run a normal school. Higher normal colleges in Jiangsu have decided to expand enrollment starting this summer vacation, and special districts such as Yancheng, Huaiyin, and Nantong will open normal colleges this year.

    All provinces pay attention to the general requirement of mass education: "Develop one, consolidate one, enroll one, teach one well." The key to consolidating private middle and primary schools is to improve the quality of teachers. In terms of training teachers, all provinces have done a lot of work. Generally, private middle school teachers form teaching and research groups, implement collective lesson preparation, and listen to each other's classes; public middle schools are used as the core to establish guidance areas, and public school teachers provide guidance to agricultural middle school teachers; each county and city in Henan uses public middle schools as the core to establish many guidance groups and guidance points, helping teachers in private middle schools to prepare lessons and solve various professional problems. The guidance groups have established Sunday business lecture meetings and a touring guidance system in the guidance area; the guidance groups also promptly promote the good experience of private middle schools and organize on-site visits. Many places in Henan have also held teacher red and expert schools, regularly organizing teachers to conduct political and professional studies on a district basis. Many normal colleges in various provinces have also specially set up correspondence departments or refresher courses to train private middle school teachers in batches.

    All provinces also attach great importance to the ideological education of teachers in private schools. In Henan Province, private middle schools are generally led by the Party committee secretaries or propaganda committee members of townships and communes; teachers in various private middle schools have undergone short-term intensive training before the start of classes, and clarified the purpose of teaching through airing views and debates; the Party organizations of various townships and communes also plan to absorb them to participate in Party class learning. Hunan organizes teachers from private schools to participate in the rectification study of teachers from public middle and primary schools.

    五省民办中、小学在发展中逐步巩固
    本报讯　本报记者报道：最近一个多月以来，江苏、河南、福建、湖南、山西五省的民办中、小学校如雨后春笋般发展起来。目前，各省正积极采取多种措施，提高师资水平，巩固民办中、小学。
    现在，江苏已发展民办农业中学六千多所；河南已普及小学教育，发展民办中学近一万所；福建基本普及了中、小学教育，新办各种民办中学二千三百多所，民办小学一万七千多所；湖南已发展民办农业中学五千三百多所，民办小学二万零七百多所，基本上做到乡乡有中学，并普及了小学教育。为了便利学生参加生产和学习，各地采取了半日制、间日制、早班、晚班等多种形式，并按照农事闲忙安排学习时间。在教学上做到政治、生产、生活相结合。
    目前，各省正积极采取多种措施提高和巩固民办中、小学。各省民办中、小学的师资来源，一般是在当地参加劳动生产的中学毕业生、复员军人、下放干部等，许多地方由乡党委书记兼任政治课教师，由农业技术推广站干部或老农兼教农业技术知识课。江苏省三所高等师范院校，都从今年的毕业生中抽派一批学生到农业中学实习。福建各地从各方面解决山区师资不足的问题。这个省有70％以上的地区是山区，教师人材缺乏，各级党政领导机关从福州、厦门、晋江等教育较发达、知识分子较多的沿海地区，组织了大批够条件的知识青年前往南平、福安等地支援山区办学。在永安、建瓯等县一些偏僻的山村里，还采用民办学校教师兼任农业社会计或扫盲班教师等“一兵多用”的办法，解决了缺乏教师的问题。各省还从长远打算，从更多方面解决民办学校的师资问题。河南今年七个专区将各办高级师范学院一所，每个县、市都开办一所师范学校。江苏各高等师范院校决定在今年暑假起扩大招生，盐城、淮阴、南通等专区今年将开办师范专科学校。
    各省都注意“发展一所，巩固一所，入学一个，教好一个”这个群众办学的总的要求。巩固民办中、小学的关键问题是提高师资水平。在培养师资方面，各省都做了许多工作。一般是由民办中学教师成立教研组，实行集体备课，相互听课；以公立中学为核心建立辅导区，由公立学校教师对农业中学教师进行辅导；河南每一个县、市都以公立中学为核心，建立许多辅导组和辅导点，分片分点帮助民办中学的教师进行备课和解决各种业务上的疑难问题。辅导组都建立了星期日业务讲座会和辅导区的巡回辅导制度；辅导组还及时推广民办中学的好经验，组织现场参观。河南许多地方还举办了教师红专学校，以区为单位，定期组织教师进行政治、业务学习。各省的许多师范院校还专设了函授部或进修班，分批训练民办中学的教师。
    各省对民办学校教师的思想教育工作也十分重视。河南省的民办中学一般都由乡、社的党委书记或宣传委员领导；各民办中学的教师在开课前都经过短期集训，通过鸣放辩论明确了教学目的；各乡、社党组织还有计划地吸收他们参加党课学习。湖南组织民办学校教师参加公立中、小学教师整风学习。
