Laughing Myself Silly
Hebei Handan Folk Song
Zhao Ruichun illustration

The mulberry wood carrying pole is bent and curved,
The girl carries water without switching shoulders.
The girl carries water walking in front,
The young man follows closely behind.
"Girl, girl, wait for me,
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk."
The girl says: "Look at all that sweat on your face,
Laughing myself silly;
Even the women can't keep up with your water carrying,
What is there worth talking about?"

    笑死俺
    河北邯郸民歌
    赵瑞椿插图桑木扁担弯又弯，姑娘担水不换肩。姑娘担水前边走，小伙子跟着后面撵。“姑娘姑娘等等我，知心话儿咱谈谈。”姑娘说：“看看你脸上那些汗，笑死俺；妇女挑水都跟不上，还有什么值得谈。”（附图片）
