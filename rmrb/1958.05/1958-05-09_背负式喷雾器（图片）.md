    Suitable for spraying and pest control of cotton, potatoes, and general crops. One person can operate it and spray one mu per hour.
    It mainly consists of a liquid medicine tank, a compression cylinder, a diaphragm water suction pump, and a nozzle hose. The compression cylinder is welded to one side inside the liquid medicine tank. The top is sealed, and the bottom has a one-way valve connected to the water suction pump. The water suction pump uses this valve to pump the liquid medicine into the compression cylinder. A rubber hose is connected to the outside of the middle part of the cylinder (where it is connected to the liquid medicine tank) to send the liquid medicine to the nozzle.
