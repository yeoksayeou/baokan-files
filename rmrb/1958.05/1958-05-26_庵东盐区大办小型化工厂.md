    Andong Salt District Vigorously Develops Small Chemical Factories
    The Andong Salt District in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, is vigorously developing small chemical factories. In April, basically every salt production cooperative and every production brigade had a chemical factory.
    These chemical factories were all invested and established by the cooperatives themselves. The workers are all members of the cooperatives, and the raw material is the byproduct of salt production—bittern. The factory buildings are all utilizing existing empty tile-roofed houses and thatched sheds. The investment in building each factory was reduced from the original plan of 1,000 yuan to 300 yuan, and production began in a very short time.
    After these chemical factories are completed, it is planned to produce more than 9,700 tons of potassium magnesium fertilizer powder and more than 1,100 tons of magnesium chloride annually. (Wang Bing)

    庵东盐区大办小型化工厂
    浙江省慈溪县庵东盐区大办小型化学工厂。在四月间基本上达到每个盐业生产合作社、每个生产大队都有一个化工厂。
    这些化工厂都是合作社自己投资开办的，工人都是合作社的社员，原料就是晒盐的副产品——苦卤。厂房都是利用原来空瓦房、草舍等。建厂投资，由原计划每个厂一千元减少到三百元，很短时间内就投入了生产。
    这些化工厂建成后，计划每年可产钾镁肥田粉九千七百多吨，氯化镁一千一百多吨。（王冰）
