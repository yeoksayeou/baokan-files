    Obtaining Ordinary Peasant Status Does Not Equal Being "Red"
    Comrade Yu Zhiming's understanding of "Red" is very one-sided. He believes that after going to the countryside, as long as one persists in labor, and after a year and a half, obtains peasant status, one will possess the conditions to be "Red." In fact, obtaining ordinary peasant status does not equal being "Red." What is the meaning of the word "Red"? I believe that "Red," most fundamentally, is about resolving the issue of standpoint and worldview. Of course, for us, cadres sent to lower levels, resolving this issue requires good labor, and through labor, first transforming ourselves into manual laborers. From arduous manual labor, we more deeply and concretely experience the joys and hardships of the working people, and change our past non-laboring people's thoughts and feelings. This is an important aspect of changing our standpoint, and also the process of realizing the combination of mental and physical labor. However, labor is only one aspect of social practice, namely production practice. While cadres go to the countryside and mountains for labor training, in addition to production practice, they must also participate in the practice of social class struggle, participate in various rural political activities, and from them, observe and experience more. In particular, we must pay attention to observing and analyzing the different political attitudes of different classes in the countryside. We must temper and test ourselves in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside. For example, after we were sent to lower levels, we caught up with the socialist great debate in the countryside. We participated in various meetings of the cooperative, such as the debate on worker-peasant relations, the debate on grain issues, the debate on the unified purchase of oil crops, as well as mass meetings to announce the control of unlawful landlords and rich peasants and the struggle against bad elements. In participating in these political activities, we clearly saw how a small number of unlawful landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements viciously provoked the relationship between the Party and the masses, and undermined the Party's various policies and the construction of cooperatives in the countryside. On the other hand, we also saw the firm stance of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and a portion of upper-middle peasants with socialist consciousness, supporting the Party, supporting socialism, and supporting the Party's various policies in the countryside. In these activities, we received vivid and extremely profound class education. Can we talk about being "Red" without this aspect of practical activity? No. In addition, we intellectuals, to change our standpoint and worldview, in addition to participating in social practice, must also carry out possible and necessary theoretical and policy studies.
    It should be understood that the process of transforming from a bourgeois or petty-bourgeois intellectual into a working-class intellectual is a long and arduous process, a process full of inner conflict and self-struggle, self-revolution. Therefore, if one believes that as long as one buries oneself in labor, and after a year and a half, one can smoothly cross this process, this idea is not only naive but also wrong.
    Therefore, we must never regard physical labor as the only way to transform the thinking of intellectuals, nor can we think that working well is the same as training well. If we think that our being sent to lower levels is only to obtain peasant status, to gild ourselves, and therefore only bury ourselves in labor, and ignore everything else, it is impossible to train well. Therefore, the most fundamental criterion for measuring whether labor is good or bad should be whether it has changed the original non-proletarian standpoint and worldview, and whether it has truly established the working-class standpoint and worldview.

### 取得普通农民资格不等于就是“红”

    取得普通农民资格不等于就是“红”
    余志明同志对“红”的了解是非常片面的。他认为下乡以后只要坚持劳动，过上一年半载，取得了农民的资格，自己就具备了“红”的条件。其实，取得普通农民资格并不等于就是“红”。“红”字的含义是什么呢？我认为“红”，最根本的就是要解决立场和世界观的问题。当然，对于我们下放干部来说，解决这个问题是需要很好的劳动，通过劳动首先把自己变成一个体力劳动者。从艰苦的体力劳动中更深刻、更具体的体味劳动人民的甘苦，改变自己过去的非劳动人民的思想感情。这是改变自己立场的重要方面，也是实现脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合的过程。但是，劳动只是社会实践的一个方面，即生产实践。而干部下乡上山劳动锻炼，除生产实践之外，还必须参加社会阶级斗争的实践，参加农村各项政治活动，从中去多观察，多体会。特别是要注意去观察和分析农村不同阶级的不同的政治态度。在农村两条道路的斗争中去锻炼自己，去考验自己。例如我们下放后，正赶上农村进行社会主义大辩论，我们参加了合作社的各种会议，如工农关系辩论会、粮食问题辩论会、油料统购辩论会，以及宣布管制不法地主富农和斗争坏分子的群众大会等等。在参加这些政治活动中，我们清楚地看到，少数不法地主、富农、反革命分子和坏分子，是如何恶毒地挑拨党群关系，破坏党在农村的各种政策和合作社的建设的。另一方面，我们也看到了广大贫农和下中农以及一部分有社会主义觉悟的上中农，拥护党，拥护社会主义，拥护党在农村中的各种政策的坚定立场。在这些活动中，使我们受到了生动的也是极为深刻的阶级教育。难道没有这一方面的实践活动能谈到“红”吗？不能，此外，我们知识分子要改变立场和世界观，除参加社会实践，还必须进行可能的和必要的理论学习和政策学习。
    应该了解，由一个资产阶级的或小资产阶级的知识分子转变为工人阶级的知识分子的过程，是一个长期的艰苦的过程，是一个充满内心冲突和自我斗争、自我革命的过程。因此，如果认为只要埋头劳动，经过一年半载就可以顺利地跨过这一过程，这种想法不但天真而且是错误的。
    因此，绝不能把体力劳动当作知识分子思想改造的唯一办法，也不能认为劳动得好就是锻炼得好。如果认为我们下放只是为了取得农民资格，镀一下金，因而只是埋头劳动，其他事情一概不管，这是不可能锻炼得好的。所以衡量劳动得好坏的最根本的标准，应该看他是否改变了原有的非无产阶级的立场和世界观，是否真正建立了工人阶级的立场和世界观。
