Criticism and Response

　　Zhangdian Station No Longer Accumulates Goods
    Regarding the opinion raised by Comrade Zhao Zhanghua in your newspaper on April 28th, that a batch of drilling tools shipped from Zhangdian to Tai'an had not been transported after ten days, the Jinan Railway Bureau has investigated and found that the goods were delayed for eight days because the employees at Zhangdian Station handling the matter did not have a clear understanding of the railway's service to industrial and agricultural production, and were not shipped out until April 19th. This practice is incorrect, and the Jinan Railway Bureau has instructed Zhangdian Station to conduct a review and rectification, and has guaranteed that similar incidents will not occur again in the future.

　　张店车站不再积压货物了
    你报4月28日刊登了赵章华同志反映由张店托运一批钻探工具到泰安，过了十天还没有运到的意见，经过济南铁路管理局查明，这批货物是因为张店站办理这件事的职工对铁路为工农业生产服务的思想不明确，因而积压了八天，直至4月19日才装出。这种做法是不对的，已经由济南铁路管理局责成张店站检查纠正，并且保证以后不再发生类似事件。
