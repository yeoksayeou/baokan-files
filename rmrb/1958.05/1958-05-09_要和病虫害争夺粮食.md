    Competing with Pests and Diseases for Grain
    At the National Symposium on the Prevention and Control of Rice Pests and Diseases, someone calculated that if the pest and disease control plans of various regions can be realized, the country could increase its rice production by 8.1 billion jin this year. But, can we get our hands on these 8.1 billion jin of grain? This depends on the success of our fight against pests and diseases.
    To defeat pests and diseases, we need strong leadership, a mass pest control movement, scientific and technological guidance, a necessary supply of pesticides and equipment, and regional cooperation and joint prevention.
    It must be admitted that doing these things well is not easy. But as long as the leadership attaches importance to pest and disease control work, and fully mobilizes and relies on the masses, we can overcome all difficulties, defeat the threat of pests and diseases, and achieve the victory of increasing grain production!

    要和病虫害争夺粮食
    全国防治水稻病虫害座谈会上，有人算了一笔账：如果各地区防治病虫害的计划能够实现，今年全国就能增加八十一亿斤稻谷。但是，八十一亿斤粮食能不能拿到手呢？这决定于我们和病虫害斗争的成就。
    要战胜病虫害，需要有坚强的领导，有群众性的治虫运动，有科学技术的指导，有必要数量的药械供应，也需要有地区之间的协作和联防。
    应该承认，做好这些工作并不是很容易的。但是只要领导重视防治病虫害工作，充分发动和依靠群众，我们就能克服一切困难，战胜病虫害的威胁，取得增产粮食的胜利！
