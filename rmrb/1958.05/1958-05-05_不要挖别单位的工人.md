    Don't Poach Workers from Other Units
    With the Great Leap Forward in production, there is a need to increase technical strength. However, some factories are resorting to unscrupulous means to poach on-the-job employees from other units. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Industry, through personal connections, attempted to poach Lin Zijian, a technical worker from the fluorescent lamp workshop of the Shanghai Huade Light Bulb Factory, to work in Guangdong. This attempt failed because the leaders of the Huade Factory did not agree. The Ningbo Metallurgical Casting Cooperative also tried to poach Zou Jinming, a foundry worker, and Lu Chenxin, a furnace worker, from the Shanghai State-owned Fishing Vessel Repair Factory through personal connections, promising to increase their wages. This was stopped after being discovered by the factory leaders. The Wuhu Shipyard in Anhui poached Chen Zhiliang, an apprentice from the Shanghai Medical Equipment Factory, and promised to promote Chen Zhiliang to a third-grade worker. The Hangzhou Hardware Parts Cooperative poached Yan Yaofu, a fitter from the Shanghai No. 1 Hairpin Cooperative.
    During the Great Leap Forward, some units do need some workers. This should be resolved through the labor department and people should not be arbitrarily poached from other units. In particular, it is even more inappropriate to use some improper means and violate national regulations and policies to entice people away. It is hoped that the relevant departments will pay attention to this.

### 不要挖别单位的工人

    不要挖别单位的工人
    随着生产大跃进，需要增加一些技术力量。但有的工厂竟不择手段去挖别的单位的在职职工。最近，广东省工业厅通过私人关系，企图将上海华德灯泡厂日光灯车间技术工人林子鉴挖到广东去工作，因为华德厂领导不同意未去成。宁波市冶铸社也通过私人关系去挖上海市国营上海渔轮修造厂铸工邹锦明、炉工陆陈新，并答应增加工资，经厂的领导发觉才制止。安徽芜湖船舶厂把上海医疗器械厂的艺徒陈志良挖去了，并答应陈志良提为三级工。杭州市五金零件合作社把上海第一发夹合作社钳工严尧夫挖去了。
    在大跃进中有些单位确实需要一些工人，应通过劳动部门来解决，不能把人家的工人任意挖去。特别是采取一些不正当的手段和违反国家规定政策来诱挖，更是不应该的。希望有关部门引起注意。
