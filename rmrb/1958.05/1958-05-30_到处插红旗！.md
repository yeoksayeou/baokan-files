Plant Red Flags Everywhere!
  Liang Ruhui

The Party Central Committee has decided to launch a revolutionary, critical journal combining theory and practice, to be named "Red Flag."

This is truly a good name, representing the great style of our Party.

Marxists have always regarded planting red flags as their glorious duty. In his youth, Marx boldly attacked those decadent reactionaries, shouting the slogan "Workers of all countries, unite!" At that time, the communist movement was only in its infancy, yet Marx and his comrades dared to think, speak, and act, daring to plant the first red flag on the ideological front occupied by all kinds of bourgeois ideas.

The red flag represents truth and a call to battle. A dazzling red flag can inspire millions, urging them to advance bravely. It can make the fallen rise again and transform the timid into the strong. In battle, a red flag planted on a high point through the smoke of gunfire can call on soldiers to redouble their efforts and seize the enemy's last position.

Our revolution on the ideological and political fronts is a struggle to plant red flags. If we do not plant red flags, others will plant white flags, yellow flags, gray flags, or black flags. In any case, every ideological front must have a flag. This is true of everything from a large position or a field of thought to a person's mind.

In the struggle of planting flags, Marxism has deeply penetrated people's hearts and occupied a large position. The east wind is sending red flags, blowing all over the world. It is sweeping away all obstacles and becoming the goal pursued and yearned for by hundreds of millions of people.

However, the struggle is not over. Our enemies are not reconciled to withdrawing from the ideological front, just as they are not reconciled to withdrawing from the stage of history. They still want to try every means to reorganize their forces. Our ideological front is always in danger of being invaded. Imperialism, in its death throes, also wants to buy some lackeys to raise fake red flags (such as modern revisionism) to confuse people. We still have to plant more red flags!

We praise and sing the praises of all those who dare to plant red flags, dare to uphold the truth, charge for the truth, and establish advanced and revolutionary banners, as Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "Relying on such people, we can lead the people of the whole country to leap forward again and again, and complete the great cause of socialist construction in a faster, better, and more economical way." We oppose those who furl their flags and drums, shrink back, and belittle themselves.

There are some people who are afraid of wolves in front and tigers behind. Their motto is "Seek no merit, but seek no fault." In their minds, it is of course a good thing to be able to plant a red flag, but what if it is planted incorrectly? They themselves are unwilling to bear this responsibility. This kind of thinking is actually individualism disguised under the cloak of "prudence." It is the shameful behavior of a deserter who would rather let the position be occupied by the enemy than fire a shot.

There are also some people who dare not plant red flags and express modesty. "I'm not sure, let's take a look." Of course, modesty is also a good thing. However, God knows what kind of modesty this is! It is clearly being a cold-eyed bystander and an outsider in a sharp struggle. Where is the modesty?

Among those who dare to plant red flags, there are also some who believe in "one effort for all time," as if once a red flag is planted somewhere, the world will be at peace from then on, and they can raise their pillows and sleep soundly. This is a lazy person, not a warrior. Thoughts are constantly changing, and they may get better or worse. The question is whether the red flag on this position will never fade? Some people are constantly vigilant to keep the red flag bright, while others do the opposite. After being exposed to wind and rain, it loses its color, and they do not reinvigorate themselves, letting it be. As a result, it changes from red to light red, to gray, to black, and eventually, who knows what color it becomes.

Planting red flags requires courage and perseverance. Let us all become brave flag bearers, planting thousands upon thousands of glorious, unfading red flags in our minds, in the depths of our hearts, and on all the ideological fronts we come into contact with, and let these red flags always guide us forward!

### 到处插红旗！

    到处插红旗！
  　梁汝怀
    党中央决定主办一个革命的、批判的、理论和实际相结合的刊物，定名为“红旗”。
    这真是个好名字，它代表着我们党的伟大的风格。
    马克思主义者从来就是以插红旗作为自己的光荣的职责的。马克思在他年青的时候，就大胆攻击那些腐朽的反动派，喊出了“全世界无产者，联合起来！”的口号。当时共产主义运动只是一个萌芽，然而马克思和他的战友们敢想敢说敢做，敢于在被各色各样资产阶级思想占领的思想阵地上插上第一面红旗。
    红旗，代表着真理，代表着战斗的号召。一面光辉夺目的红旗，能使千万人精神焕发，奋勇向前，能使跌倒的人又重新站起来，怯懦的人变为坚强。在战斗中，一面红旗穿过硝烟插上制高点，就能号召战士们再接再厉，去夺取敌人的最后阵地。
    我们在思想战线上和政治战线上的革命，就是插红旗的斗争。我们不去插红旗，别人就去插白旗，插黄旗，插灰旗，或者插黑旗。反正任何思想阵地上都得有一面旗帜。大而至于一个阵地，一个思想领域，小而至一个人的头脑，都是如此。
    在插旗的斗争中，马克思主义已经深入人心，占领了很大的阵地，东风送着红旗，吹遍世界各地，它势如破竹，所向披靡，成为亿万人追求和向往的目标。
    但是，斗争并没有结束，我们的敌人并不甘心退出思想阵地，正如它们不甘心退出历史舞台一样，它还想千方百计地重整旗鼓。我们的思想阵地时时刻刻都有受到侵袭的可能。帝国主义在它的垂死的挣扎中，也想收买些喽罗打起冒牌的红旗（例如现代修正主义）去迷惑人。我们还要去插上更多的红旗！
    我们赞美歌颂一切敢于插红旗、敢于坚持真理、为真理冲锋陷阵、树立先进和革命旗帜的人，正如刘少奇同志所指出的：“依靠这样的人，我们才能够领导全国人民跃进再跃进，多快好省地完成伟大的社会主义建设事业。”我们反对那种偃旗息鼓、萎萎缩缩、妄自菲薄的人。
    有一种人，前怕狼，后怕虎。他们的格言是“不求有功，但求无过”。在他们想来，能插红旗当然是好事，但如果插错了怎么办？他们自己就不愿担负这个责任了。这种思想，实际上是“稳重”的外衣下掩盖着个人主义。也就是宁愿让阵地被敌人侵占而不敢发一枪的可耻的逃兵。
    也有一种人不敢插红旗，表示谦虚。“没有把握，看看再说”。谦虚当然也是好事。可是，天知道这是一种什么样的谦虚！明明是在尖锐的斗争里做个缩着袖管的冷眼旁观者，做个局外人，哪里是什么谦虚？
    在敢于插红旗的人们中间，也有一种一劳永逸论者，好像只要哪里一插红旗，也就从此天下太平，可以垫高了枕头睡大觉了。这是一种懒汉，不是战士。思想是在不断变化的，可能越变越好，也可能变坏。问题是在这个阵地上的红旗是不是永不褪色？有的人时刻警惕着保持红旗的鲜艳，也有的人却相反，经过风吹雨打，就掉了颜色，而自己又不自振作，听之任之，结果就由红而浅红，而灰，而黑，结果不知变成什么颜色了。
    插红旗，需要勇气，也需要恒心。让我们大家都成为勇敢的旗手，在自己的头脑里，在自己的心灵深处，在我们所接触的一切思想阵地上，插上千千万万面辉煌的、永不褪色的红旗，让这些红旗永远指引着我们前进吧！
