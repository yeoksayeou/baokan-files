    Twenty Cities Boxing Championship Concludes
    Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin Take First, Second, and Third Place in Team Totals

    (Our newspaper dispatch) The 1958 National Twenty Cities Boxing Championship, with over 140 athletes participating, began on the 18th and concluded on the 25th after eight days of intense and fierce competition.

    In the junior flyweight division, Wang Chunnian of the Tianjin team defeated all opponents to win the championship. The runner-up was Li Zhixiong of the Xi'an team.

    Wang Shouxin of the Beijing team, who had won the flyweight championship three times in a row, retained the title again this year. Due to his relatively poor endurance, this victory was hard-won. Jin Yaofu of Shanghai, who took second place, and others threatened his championship crown.

    The junior lightweight final was contested between Li Guoji of Shenyang and Lu Jisheng of Beijing. Both were newcomers. In the end, Li Guoji won the championship. Xu Liansheng of Shanghai, who was originally considered the top seed in this division, was knocked down by Li Guoji in the match on the 21st and eliminated.

    In the light middleweight division, the audience favored Wang Guojun of Beijing, the 1956 champion in this division, but unexpectedly, in the championship final on the 25th, he lost to Qu Jianxun of Shanghai and finished as runner-up.

    The heavyweight final held on the evening of the 24th was very appealing. This was the first official heavyweight competition in our country. He Fengke of Shijiazhuang defeated his only opponent, Wang Shuzheng of Taiyuan, and became our country's first heavyweight champion.

    Boxing veterans Zhou Shibin and Zhang Lide of the Shanghai team won the championships in the welterweight and middleweight divisions, respectively. As veterans, they easily defeated their opponents. Ma Hongpei of Beijing and Ai Gang of Xuzhou took second place in these two divisions.

    Two other athletes from the Shanghai team, Ji Hengrui and Gu Jingyu, took the championship and runner-up positions in the lightweight division, respectively.

    The championships in the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions were won by Liu Jinhan of Guangzhou and Ye Laihong of Harbin. The runners-up in these two divisions were Chen Jun of Changchun and Jin Jinduo of Tianjin.

    The Shanghai team had relatively balanced technical skills, achieved the best results in the competition, and won four division championships. They scored a total of seventy-one points, taking first place in the team total score. The second and third places in the total score were taken by the Beijing and Tianjin teams, with scores of thirty-nine and twenty-eight points, respectively.

    二十城市拳击锦标赛结束
    上海、北京、天津分获团体总分一、二、三名
    本报讯　有一百四十多名运动员参加的1958年全国二十城市拳击锦标赛从18日开始，经过八天的紧张剧烈的竞争，于25日结束。
    天津队王春年在次最轻级比赛中击败了所有的对手获到了这一级冠军，得亚军的是西安队李志雄。
    连得三次最轻级冠军的北京队王守忻这次又蝉联了这一级的冠军。由于耐久力比较差，这次他胜来颇为不易。取得亚军的上海金耀富等都曾威胁着他的冠军宝座。
    争夺次轻级冠亚军的是沈阳李国济和北京陆吉生。他们两人都是新手。结果还是李国济夺了冠军。原来被认为是这一级的第一号种子选手上海许连生在21日比赛中，被李国济一拳击倒，而淘汰下来。
    轻中级比赛，观众们都嘱意于1956年这一级的冠军北京王国钧，但是出乎意料地，在25日的冠亚军决赛中，他败给上海瞿建训，屈居了亚军。
    24日晚进行的最重级决赛很吸引人。因为最重级正式比赛在我国这还是有史以来第一次。石家庄何凤珂击败了他的唯一对手太原王树正，得了我国第一个最重级冠军。
    拳击名将、上海队周士彬和张立德分别获次中级和中量级比赛的冠军。毕竟是老将，他们都很轻易地击败了对手们。获得这两级亚军的是北京马鸿培和徐州艾纲。
    上海队另两个选手纪恒惠和顾景裕分别取轻量级的冠亚军。
    获得次重级和重量级冠军的是广州刘锦汉和哈尔滨叶来洪。获得这两级亚军的是长春陈俊和天津靳金铎。
    上海队队员技术比较平均，在比赛中成绩最好，夺了四个级的冠军。他们共得了七十一分，获得这次比赛团体总分第一名。获得这次总分第二、三名的是北京队和天津队，他们的得分是三十九分和二十八分。
