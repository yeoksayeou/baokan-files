The Political Situation in Iraq
By Sailan Adiele, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party

A Sharp Crisis in the Reactionary Ruling Clique

In the current environment, the reactionary ruling clique of Iraq is in a sharp crisis. The internal contradictions of the enemies of the people are deepening day by day. This is the result of the Arab national liberation movement gaining a series of victories with the help of the socialist camp. It is also the result of the rising national democratic consciousness of the Iraqi people, and new forces uniting around the slogans of "National United Front" and "National Liberation." Precisely for this reason, the various conspiracies of imperialism have been defeated one after another, and as a result, they have replaced the government in Iraq time and again. In the middle of last year, the Nuri al-Said government resigned due to being in severe isolation both domestically and abroad, and the Ayubi government came to power. At that time, the United States announced that it would protect imperialist interests in the Middle East, so the Ayubi government was able to come to power. But this government was unable to participate in Henderson's conspiracy against Syria. After only five months, the Ayubi government fell again. Next came the Mirjan government, whose main activity was to prepare for the recent Baghdad Pact conference in Ankara, and to take practical steps to merge Jordan and Iraq. This government's lifespan was only two months before giving way to a government composed of Nuri al-Said, the old-brand agent of British imperialism.

The crisis encountered by the Iraqi reactionary rulers is an integral part of the crisis encountered by British and American imperialism in the Middle East. The rise of the Arab national liberation movement is often linked to the active support and vigorous assistance of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union. All attempts by imperialism, especially the Eisenhower Doctrine, aimed at isolating the Arab national movement and the liberated Arab countries from the socialist camp, but all these attempts have been defeated. On the contrary, Egypt and Syria have both obtained weapons to defend their motherlands from socialist countries. The Soviet Union adopted a moving and historic position regarding the imperialist and Zionist aggression against Egypt, and regarding the armed aggression threats made by the United States and Turkey against Syria. Syria, Egypt, and Yemen have successively concluded various economic agreements with the Soviet Union and People's China. All of these have deepened the friendship and respect for socialist countries in the hearts of our Arab people, and made us understand more than ever before that there is only one road to our liberation and progress, which is to strengthen this selfless solidarity and cooperation to oppose the various conspiracies and pressures of world imperialism led by the United States.

The failure of the Eisenhower Doctrine to prevent the development of the Arab national liberation movement is also a failure, because the establishment of the United Arab Republic, and Yemen's decision to join the United Arab Republic on a federal basis, have largely strengthened the position of the liberated Arab countries, and encouraged the enthusiasm of the remaining Arab national struggles. 90% of the oil produced by Arab countries has to pass through the territories of Syria and Egypt, and the fact that these two countries are united under the same anti-imperialist nationalistic banner is very unpleasant to the imperialists. The Eisenhower Doctrine's attempt to fill the "vacuum," that is, to replace the gradually collapsing British and French imperialism in the Middle East, has also failed. Judging from the recent Baghdad Pact conference held in Ankara, the position of the United States in this alliance is clearly inferior to its position during the foreign ministers' meeting held in Karachi in the first half of last year, despite Dulles's great efforts at the Ankara conference.

According to imperialism, the Middle East region has particularly important strategic value. The region's oil reserves account for 60% of the world's oil reserves. This region is a major market for imperialist countries, and it is also a vital transportation route. But the position of imperialism in the Middle East is precarious, and therefore, the helmsmen of imperialist policy feel panicked today. Various adventurous plans and extensive subversive activities of imperialism have resurfaced. The so-called Rockefeller Plan is the clearest example. The content of this plan is to expand the area covered by the Eisenhower Doctrine, emphasizing the necessity of taking risks, regardless of whether the adventurous behavior will cause various regional small wars or international wars.

Imperialism's New Conspiracy

Although various attempts to provoke new wars or armed conflicts within the Arab nation have been severely condemned by the Arab people and all forces that love freedom and peace throughout the world, it cannot be guaranteed that imperialism will not use new means to repeat such attempts. When carrying out such sinful activities, they will also have local agents, Israeli extremist Zionists, or reactionary rulers of Turkey, Iraq, and other Arab countries to cooperate with them. In the weeks following the establishment of the United Arab Republic, a series of conspiracies began to isolate this new country from other Arab countries: merging Jordan into Iraq and tying it to the wheels of the Baghdad Pact; provoking Egypt on the Egyptian-Sudanese border; disputes created by Tunisia against Egypt; conducting conspiracies to set up international troops on the border between Tunisia and Algeria, strengthening the encirclement of the Algerian National Liberation Army. The French air force's attack on the village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef paved the way for this conspiracy. The conspiracy against Syria by Iraq and Jordan was exposed, and the conspiracy against the United Arab Republic by the United States and Saudi Arabia was also exposed. Various provocative actions by Israel and Turkey on the borders of Arab countries are still continuing. In addition, there are France's intensified attacks on free Algerian revolutionaries, and Britain's intensified attacks on the people of Oman and villages in Yemen.

At this time, Nuri al-Said reappeared in front of the political stage as Prime Minister, because his student Mirjan had prepared the atmosphere for him to come to power.

Undoubtedly, this change means that Iraq is determined to strengthen its subordination to imperialist countries, defend imperialist interests, and increase pressure on national movements, especially on the Communist Party. But Nuri al-Said's return to power is not only manifested in the various measures that Iraq will take domestically, but also in the use of our country and army to carry out new conspiracies against the United Arab Republic and the entire Arab national liberation movement.

We often see Nuri al-Said acting behind the scenes to defend the interests of imperialism. At the same time, we also often see that he will not come to the front of the stage unless imperialism is about to carry out major conspiracies that no other agent dares to carry out. Therefore, we should be more vigilant now.

Our party believes that defending the United Arab Republic and thwarting imperialist conspiracies is completely consistent with the struggle to liberate Iraq from the Baghdad Pact, to achieve national independence, and to defend peace in the Middle East and world peace, and is inseparable. Our party believes that this young republic is a progressive first step representing the inevitable path of national unity for the Arab peoples of all countries at the current stage of historical development. Our party also believes that the United Arab Republic will be better able to deal with imperialist enemies and their agents, and will be better able to fulfill its historical mission, as long as its policies trust the people's awareness more, as long as it can better guarantee the people's unity and democratic freedoms, as long as it can become a good example to attract the hearts of the people of the remaining Arab countries, and as long as it strengthens its friendship and cooperation with the great socialist camp, which has always taken a strong and faithful supporter's position for our just liberation cause.

The union of Jordan and Iraq is completely contrary to the interests of the Arab national unity expected by the people of Iraq and the people of Jordan. This is because this union is not based on weakening imperialist forces, but on concentrating forces and conspiracies to oppose the United Arab Republic and to hinder the people of Arab countries from moving towards the goal of unity. This union actually pulls Jordan into the Baghdad Pact and places Jordan under the control of the Iraqi army and armed police, and the Iraqi armed forces have a long history of experience in persecuting the people. In this way, the friction between the Baghdad Pact countries and the liberated Arab countries is intensified, and the threat to those countries is even more serious.

Therefore, we Iraqi people are using strikes, class boycotts, demonstrations, sending delegations, sending telegrams, and other powerful ways in these days to express our support for the birth of the United Arab Republic and to condemn the union of Jordan and Iraq. The Iraqi people demand to get rid of the Baghdad Pact and all relations that subordinate Iraq to British and American imperialism. They demand to form a federation with the United Arab Republic. They will wage a relentless struggle under the leadership of the National United Front to win their just demands.

The forces of imperialism will surely decline in our struggling country. (To be continued)

    伊拉克的政治局势
    伊拉克共产党中央委员会书记  赛兰·阿迭勒
    反动统治集团的尖锐危机
    在现在的环境中，伊拉克的反动统治集团正处在尖锐的危机中。人民公敌的内部矛盾日愈加深，那是阿拉伯民族解放运动由于社会主义阵营的帮助而获得一系列胜利的结果，也是伊拉克人民群众民族民主觉悟高涨，以及新的力量在“民族统一战线”和“民族解放”口号的周围团结起来的结果。正因为这个缘故，帝国主义的种种阴谋一个一个地遭到失败了，因而他们在伊拉克接二连三地更换政府。去年年中，努里·赛义德政府由于在国内和国外陷于严重的孤立而辞职，阿尤比政府上台。在那个时候，美国宣布要保护在中东的帝国主义利益，所以阿尤比政府才得上台。但是这个政府对于汉德逊对叙利亚进行的阴谋无法参加。才过了五个多月，阿尤比政府又倒台了。接着上台的是米尔詹政府，这个政府的主要活动是准备最近在安卡拉召开的巴格达条约会议，并且为使约旦和伊拉克合并而采取实际的步骤。这个政府的寿命不过两个多月，就让位给由英帝国主义老牌的代理人努里·赛义德所组成的政府。
    伊拉克反动统治者所遭遇的危机，是英美帝国主义在中东遭遇危机的一个组成部分。阿拉伯民族解放运动的高涨，和以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的积极支持和大力帮助是经常联系在一起的。帝国主义的一切企图，特别是艾森豪威尔主义，其目的在于使阿拉伯民族运动和已解放了的阿拉伯国家与社会主义阵营相隔绝，但是这些企图统统都遭到了失败。正与此相反的是，埃及和叙利亚都从社会主义国家得到了保卫祖国的武器。苏联对于帝国主义和犹太复国主义对埃及的侵略，对于美土两国对叙利亚提出武装侵略的恫吓，都采取了动人的历史性的立场。叙利亚、埃及、也门三国又先后与苏联和人民中国缔结了各种经济协定。所有这些都在我们阿拉伯人民的心中加深了对社会主义国家的友情和敬意，并且使我们比过去任何时候都懂得自己的解放和进步只有一条道路，就是要加强这种无私的团结和合作，来反对以美国为首的世界帝国主义的各种阴谋和压力。
    艾森豪威尔主义未能阻止阿拉伯民族解放运动的发展，也是一个失败，因为阿拉伯联合共和国的成立，也门决定在联邦的基础上加入阿拉伯联合共和国，大体上加强了已解放的阿拉伯国家的地位，而且鼓舞了其余的阿拉伯民族斗争的热情。阿拉伯国家出产的石油，有90％要通过叙利亚和埃及的领土，而这两个国家在反帝国主义的同一面民族主义旗帜下联合起来了，在帝国主义者看来，这是很不顺眼的，艾森豪威尔主义对于填补“真空”，即取代逐渐崩溃的英法帝国主义在中东的地位，也是失败的，由最近在安卡拉召开的巴格达条约会议看来，美国在这个同盟中的地位，比去年上半年在卡拉奇召开外交部长会议期间的地位显然大有逊色，尽管杜勒斯在安卡拉会议中费了九牛二虎之力。
    据帝国主义看来，中东地区具有特别重要的战略价值。这个地区的石油蕴藏量占全世界石油蕴藏量的60％。这个地区是帝国主义国家主要的市场，同时又是国际交通的要道。但是帝国主义在中东地区的地位是摇摇欲坠的，因此，帝国主义政策的舵手们，今天感到张惶失措。帝国主义的各种冒险计划和广泛的颠覆活动，又重新抬头了。所谓洛克菲勒计划就是最明白的例证，这个计划的内容是扩大艾森豪威尔主义所包括的地区，强调冒险的必要性，不管冒险的行为会不会引起各式各样地区性的小战或者国际性的大战。
    帝国主义的新阴谋
    尽管在阿拉伯民族内部挑起新的战争或者武装冲突的种种企图已遭到阿拉伯人民和全世界爱好自由和和平的一切力量的严厉斥责，但是不能保证帝国主义不会再用新的手段来重复这一类的企图。他们在进行这种罪恶活动的时候，还会有本地的代理人、以色列极端的犹太复国主义者或土耳其、伊拉克和其它阿拉伯国家的反动统治者与它们合作。在阿拉伯联合共和国成立后的数周，为使这个新国家与其他的阿拉伯国家隔绝的一系列的阴谋活动就开始了：把约旦并入伊拉克，并且把它绑在巴格达条约的车轮上；在埃及—苏丹两国的边界上引起对埃及的挑衅；突尼斯对埃及制造的纠纷；进行阴谋活动，准备在突尼斯和阿尔及利亚的边界上设置国际部队，加强包围阿尔及利亚民族解放军，法国空军袭击萨基埃特—西迪—优素福村就是为这种阴谋铺平道路的；由伊拉克和约旦参加的对叙利亚的阴谋被揭露了，美沙两国对阿拉伯联合共和国的阴谋也被揭露了；以色列和土耳其对阿拉伯国家边境的种种挑衅行动仍在继续进行。此外，还有法国对自由的阿尔及利亚革命者的加紧进攻，英国对阿曼人民和也门村庄的加紧进攻。
    正在这个时候，努里·赛义德又以总理的身份再出现于政治舞台的前面，因为他的学生米尔詹已经替他准备了上台的气氛。
    无疑的，这种变更，意味着伊拉克坚决加强它对于帝国主义国家的从属地位，保卫帝国主义的利益，增加对民族运动、特别是对共产党的压力。但是努里·赛义德重新上台的目的不仅表现于伊拉克在国内将要采取的各种措施，也表现于利用我们的国家和军队去对阿拉伯联合共和国和整个的阿拉伯民族解放运动进行新的阴谋。
    我们经常看到努里·赛义德为保卫帝国主义的利益而在幕后活动。同时，我们也经常看到他不走到舞台面前来便罢，一走到面前来，一定是因为帝国主义将要进行种种除了他别的代理人都不敢执行的重大的阴谋。因此，现在我们应该更加警惕。
      我们的党认为保卫阿拉伯联合共和国，击破帝国主义的阴谋，同为从巴格达条约中解放伊拉克，实现民族独立，为保卫中东和平和世界和平而进行的斗争是完全一致的，是不可分割的。我们的党认为这个年轻的共和国是代表各国阿拉伯人民在历史发展的现阶段必然走上民族团结的道路的第一步，这是进步的。我们的党也认为阿拉伯联合共和国将更能对付帝国主义敌人及其代理人，将更能完成其历史任务，只要它的政策是更多地信任人民的觉悟，只要它更能保证人民的团结和民主自由权利，只要它更能够成为吸引其余阿拉伯国家人民的民心的好榜样，只要它更加强同伟大的社会主义阵营的友谊和合作，这个阵营对于我们正义的解放事业，曾经而且经常采取强大而忠实的援助者的立场。
    约旦与伊拉克的联合是完全违反伊拉克人民和约旦人民所期望的阿拉伯民族团结一致的利益的。这是因为这种联合不是建立在削弱帝国主义势力的基础上，相反地是建立在集中力量和阴谋来反对阿拉伯联合共和国，来阻碍阿拉伯各国人民向着统一的目标前进。这种联合实际上把约旦拉入巴格达条约，把约旦放在伊拉克的军队和武装警察的控制之下，而伊拉克的武装部队对于迫害人民是有着长期的经验的。这样一来，巴格达条约国家与解放了的阿拉伯国家之间的摩擦更加剧烈，对于那些国家的威胁也更加严重了。
    因此，我们伊拉克人民在这些日子里正在用罢工、罢课、游行示威、派遣代表团、打电报等等有力的方式表示支持阿拉伯联合共和国的诞生，表示谴责约旦与伊拉克的联合。伊拉克人民要求摆脱巴格达条约和使伊拉克从属于英美帝国主义的一切关系。他们要求与阿拉伯联合共和国结成联邦。他们将在民族统一战线的领导下，为争取他们正义的要求而进行无情的斗争。
    帝国主义的势力一定也要在我们奋斗的国家里没落。　（续完）
