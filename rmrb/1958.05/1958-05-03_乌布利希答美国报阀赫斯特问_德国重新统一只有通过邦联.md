Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 1st. The German News Agency published a statement by Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, in response to questions from Hearst, owner of the American Hearst newspaper trust, and Hearst, editor and publisher of International News Service.

In answering Hearst's questions, Ulbricht emphasized that the government of the German Democratic Republic is the only German government that steadfastly defends the national interests of Germany. He said that the starting point of the national policy of the German Democratic Republic is that Germany must have all the guarantees for peaceful development and the implementation of a peaceful foreign policy in order to occupy its rightful place among the peoples of the world.

Speaking about the issue of German reunification, Ulbricht said that the only way to achieve German reunification is to establish a confederation of the two German states. However, he warned that if West Germany persists in its policy of atomic armament, it risks losing the possibility of achieving German reunification through the establishment of a confederation.

Ulbricht said that the reunification of Germany will be a process of rapprochement and understanding between the two sides, which will require a period of time and cannot be achieved merely through an election. He pointed out, "The GDR is a sovereign state, and although the current US government does not like it, this does not change the reality."

Ulbricht told Hearst, "It would be very welcome if the US government stopped letting its atomic bombers fly over West Germany and abandoned supplying West Germany with atomic weapons, if the US abandoned its atomic bases in West Germany and no longer obstructed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe."

Referring to the economic development of the German Democratic Republic, Ulbricht pointed out that the unparalleled superiority of socialist planned economy over capitalist economy has been sufficiently demonstrated by the development of the Soviet Union, China, and the German Democratic Republic.

Ulbricht said that West Germany's industrial production has stagnated, and even slightly declined, while the GDR's production continues to grow according to plan. He also cited past figures to illustrate: taking 1936 as 100, the total industrial production index of West Germany in 1956 was 211, while that of the GDR was 222. In 1957, West Germany's production increased by 5.1%, while the GDR's increased by 7%. He emphasized, "Our superiority in all aspects will become increasingly evident."

    乌布利希答美国报阀赫斯特问
    德国重新统一只有通过邦联
    据新华社柏林1日电　德意志通讯社发表了德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记乌布利希对美国赫斯特系报业托辣斯老板和国际新闻社总编辑兼发行人赫斯特的谈话。
    乌布利希在回答赫斯特的问题时强调指出，德意志民主共和国政府是德国唯一坚定不渝地保卫德国民族利益的政府。他说，德意志民主共和国政府的民族政策的出发点是，德国必须具备和平发展和执行和平外交政策的一切保证，才能够在各国人民中占有应得的地位。
    乌布利希在谈到德国统一问题时说，实现德国重新统一的唯一道路是建立两个德国的邦联。但是他警告说，如果西德坚持原子武装政策就有失去这种通过建立邦联来实现德国重新统一的可能性的危险。
    乌布利希说，德国的重新统一将是一个双方接近和谅解的过程，需要经过一段时间而不是仅仅通过一次选举就能实现的。他指出，“民主德国是一个主权国家，虽然美国的现政府不喜欢它，但是这并不能改变现实。”
    乌布利希对赫斯特说，“如果美国政府停止让它的原子轰炸机飞越西德并且放弃以原子武器供应西德，如果美国放弃在西德的原子基地并且不再阻挠中欧无原子武器区的建立，那将是非常值得欢迎的。”
    乌布利希在谈到民主德国的经济发展时指出，社会主义的计划经济比资本主义经济的无比优越性已经通过苏联、中国和德意志民主共和国的发展而得到了足够的证明。
    乌布利希说，目前西德的工业生产已经停滞，甚至略有减退，而民主德国的生产却继续按照计划增长着。他并且举出了过去的数字来说明：以1936年为一百，1956年西德全部工业生产指数是二百一十一，而民主德国却是二百二十二。1957年西德的生产增长了5.1％，而民主德国却增长了7％。他强调指出，“我们在各方面的优越性将会越来越强烈地表现出来。”
