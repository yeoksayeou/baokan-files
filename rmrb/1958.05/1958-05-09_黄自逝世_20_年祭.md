Memorial to Huang Zi on the 20th Anniversary of His Death
    贺绿汀 [Hè Lǜtíng]
    Today is the 20th anniversary of the death of music educator and composer Mr. Huang Zi. He was only thirty-four years old when he passed away. He had made full preparations in his professional training for the construction of the motherland's musical and cultural undertaking.
    The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was one of the earliest professional music schools in our country. Although this school was founded by Xiao Youmei, the credit for bringing the school to a certain scale and professional level should go to Huang Zi. In addition to his heavy administrative work at the school, he also taught all the composition courses. In teaching, his attitude was very humble but serious; although he never criticized students face-to-face, students dared not be careless with his assignments.
    Due to the heavy administrative and teaching work, he had little time for creation; but he still wrote many works. After the "September 18th" Incident, he not only created "Anti-Japanese Song" (i.e., "Anti-Enemy Song") himself, but also personally led students to create patriotic songs. Several of his anti-Japanese songs were popular throughout the country at that time.
    His "Song of Everlasting Regret" is a large choral work adapted from Bai Juyi's poem, the content of which is a veiled criticism of Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rule at the time; unfortunately, he died after completing only seven of the ten movements. This work not only demonstrated his mature skills and creative talent, but also showed his profound and diverse expressive techniques and creative realm. The chapter "Fisherman's Drums Shake the Earth" is full of anger at the fatuous rulers. And the chapter "Mountains are in Vain and Dim Space" is lingering and poignant; this chapter can be said to be one of the earliest choral pieces in a purely Chinese style, and it is still a very mature work today.
    Mr. Huang Zi was a patriot politically. He was dissatisfied with the reactionary rule at the time, but rarely expressed it in words on weekdays. Because he was busy with teaching and school administrative work, his circle of life was relatively narrow, which had an impact on his creation. His love for students stemmed from his ardent hope for the construction of the motherland's musical culture. Whenever students could not afford tuition, Xiao Youmei always let the students drop out of school, believing that one should not study music without money; but Huang Zi often used his own salary to pay tuition for students. He did not like those students with a strong comprador-bourgeois atmosphere, believing that they would not be of much use after graduation, but he valued students from the inland, even if these students were older and made slower progress, because they could play a role in the inland in the future. In school work, he tended towards progress and innovation, and constantly struggled against the school's reactionary and backward tendencies, so he was dissatisfied with the school authorities, so that he later had to resign from the post of director of studies and specialize in teaching and creation.
    Due to his class background and living environment, Mr. Huang Zi had certain limitations in his thinking, which prevented him from standing on the front line of struggle and playing a greater role like Comrades Nie Er and Xian Xinghai. However, he has made contributions in the field of music education, and his creations are still a valuable asset for us.
    Today, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao's correct literary and art policies, the new China's musical and cultural undertaking has made amazing progress. If Mr. Huang Zi could live to this day, he would have made more achievements for the people. Therefore, his early death is indeed an irreparable loss to our music community.
    Of course, our music education today not only far exceeds the scale of the time; the nature of the school has also undergone fundamental changes. Mr. Huang Zi's help to poor students and his dislike of those bourgeois fashionable students stemmed purely from the general concept of building the motherland's musical culture, so it was impossible to change the bourgeois nature of the school. Today, we clearly put forward the need to cultivate music talents who have both a certain professional level and cultural accomplishment, and have a high degree of political awareness and the idea of serving socialist construction wholeheartedly. We emphasize that music should serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and inherit our national heritage. All music teachers and students, through multiple ideological transformation movements, are fundamentally changing their past bourgeois ideological positions. Under the correct and strong leadership of the Party, musical culture is moving towards an infinitely bright future. All of this was something that Mr. Huang Zi could not have dreamed of at the time. As a musician in the era of bourgeois democratic revolution, Mr. Huang Zi has things worthy of our learning in his creative teaching, and even his personal moral character. Studying his works and carrying forward these advantages is beneficial to our construction of new socialist music.

    黄自逝世20年祭
    贺绿汀
    今天是音乐教育家、作曲家黄自先生逝世二十周年纪念日。他逝世那年仅三十四岁，为了祖国音乐文化事业的建设，他在自己的专业修养上曾经作过充分的准备。
    上海音专是我国最早的一所专业音乐学校。虽然这所学校是萧友梅创办的，但是使学校具有一定的规模与专业水平还应该归功于黄自。他除了担任繁重的学校行政工作，同时还担任全部作曲专业课程的教学。在教学方面，他的态度很谦逊但严肃认真；虽然从不当面责备学生，但学生对他的功课不敢马虎。
    由于行政和教学工作繁重，他很少时间进行创作；但也写了不少的作品。“九一八”事变以后，他不但自己创作了“抗日歌”（即“抗敌歌”），还亲自领导学生创作爱国歌曲。他有好几首抗日歌曲在当时全国各地流行。
    他的“长恨歌”是根据白居易诗改编的大合唱曲，内容是影射当时蒋介石反动统治的；可惜十个乐章只完成了七个乐章就去世了。这个作品不但表现了他成熟的技巧和创作才能，也可以看出他深刻的多样的表现手法与创作意境。其中“渔阳鼙鼓动地来”一章充满了对昏庸的统治者的愤怒。而“山在虚无缥渺间”一章又是缠绵悱恻；这一章可说是我国最早的一首纯中国风格的合唱曲，现在看起来仍不失为一首很成熟的作品。
    黄自先生在政治上是一个爱国主义者。他对当时的反动统治是不满的，但平日很少从言语中表现出来。因忙于教学和学校行政工作，生活圈子比较狭窄，这对于他的创作是有影响的。他对学生的爱护出自他对祖国音乐文化建设的热望。每当学生缴不起学费，萧友梅总是让学生退学，并认为没有钱就不应该学音乐；但是黄自却经常用自己的薪金替学生缴学费。他不喜欢那些带着浓厚买办资产阶级气息的学生，认为他们毕业出来用处不大，却很重视内地来的学生，即使这些学生年龄大一点进步慢一点也不要紧，因为他们将来可以回内地发生作用。在学校工作中，他倾向于进步革新，不断地和学校的反动落后倾向作斗争，因此为学校当局所不满，以致后来不得不辞去教务主任职务，专门从事教学和创作。
    黄自先生由于阶级出身和生活环境的关系，思想上有一定的局限性，这就使他不能像聂耳和冼星海同志那样站在斗争的最前线，发挥更大的作用。但是，他在音乐教育事业方面是有贡献的，他的创作至今还是我们一部分宝贵的财产。
    今天新中国音乐文化事业在党和毛主席正确文艺政策的领导下，有了惊人的发展，假如黄自先生能活到现在，将为人民作出更多的成绩。因此他的早死，实在是我们音乐界一个不可弥补的损失。
    当然，我们今天的音乐教育不但远远超过了当时的规模；学校的性质，也有了根本的改变。黄自先生当时帮助穷苦学生，不喜欢那些资产阶级的时髦学生，是单纯地从建设祖国音乐文化这个笼统的概念出发，因而不可能改变学校资产阶级的性质。今天我们则明确提出了要培养出既有一定的专业水平与文化修养，又有高度的政治觉悟与全心全意为社会主义建设服务思想的音乐人才。我们强调音乐要为工农兵服务，要继承自己的民族遗产。所有的音乐教师和学生通过多次的思想改造运动，正在从根本上改变过去资产阶级思想立场。在党的正确而坚强的领导下，音乐文化正在向无限美好的前途迈进。凡此一切，都是黄自先生当时所不能梦想到的。作为一个资产阶级民主革命时期的音乐家，黄自先生在他的创作教学，以致个人的道德品质方面，都有值得我们学习的地方。研究他的作品，发扬他的这些优点，对于我们建设新的社会主义音乐是有好处的。
