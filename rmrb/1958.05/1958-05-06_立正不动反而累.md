Why?

When standing at attention, although one isn't moving, it doesn't mean the muscles aren't working. In fact, at this time, the muscles of the whole body (especially some of the large muscles of the back and thighs) are contracting tensely and continuously to maintain this posture, so it is easy to get tired. Walking, although it involves movement, allows the muscles to tense and relax alternately, with work and rest, so it is not easy to feel tired.

From the point of view of the nervous system, when standing still, the nerve cells that control those muscles are always excited. Constant excitement will lead to exhaustion, and that is the feeling of fatigue. When walking, sometimes this group of nerve cells works, and sometimes that group of nerve cells works, taking turns to work and taking turns to rest, so it is not easy to become fatigued. (Jing)

### 立正不动反而累

专栏：为什么？

    立正不动反而累
    立正的时候，虽然不动，却并不意味着肌肉不在工作。其实这时候全身肌肉（特别是背部、大腿的一些大肌肉）正在紧张地持续地收缩着，才能保持这种姿势，所以容易累。走路虽然是动的，但是肌肉一会儿紧张，一会儿松驰，有工作、有休息，所以不容易觉得累。
    从神经系统的观点来说，站着不动，那末管那群肌肉的神经细胞总是兴奋着。老兴奋，也会衰竭，这就是疲劳的感觉。走路的时候，一会儿这群神经细胞工作，一会儿那群神经细胞工作，轮流工作，轮流休息，就不容易疲劳。（景）
