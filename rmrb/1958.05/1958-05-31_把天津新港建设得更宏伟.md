    把天津新港建设得更宏伟
    新华社天津29日电　规模巨大的天津新港第二期建港工程的序幕已经揭开。19日，“浚利”号电动挖泥船开进航道，开始了把现在的单航道改建为双航道的疏浚工程。第一码头将要扩建，增加一艘万吨轮船泊位。在这个工地上，勘探工作已经基本完成，6月初就要开工制作钢筋混凝土大桩。兴建第十号大型仓库的工地上，建筑工人正在放线，准备马上打桩。此外还要增建大货仓，改造现有船闸，增建工人宿舍等。
    天津新港的第一期工程是1952年10月完成的。开港五年以来，它已经同二十四个国家的六十五个港口间进行了大量的贸易往来。新港业务的发展十分迅速，1957年的货物吞吐量比1953年增加了一点一倍。
