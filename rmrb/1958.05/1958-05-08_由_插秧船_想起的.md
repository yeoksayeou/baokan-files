    Thoughts Inspired by the "Rice Planting Boat"
    He Zhuo
    Anyone even slightly familiar with agricultural activities knows that rice transplanting is one of the most arduous tasks. At the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition, I saw the "rice planting boat" created by farmers in Xinhui County, Guangdong. The construction is very simple, costing only four yuan per boat. Farmers sitting on it no longer have to work with their hands and feet in the mud all day, their backs bent to the sky. A cloth awning or umbrella can also be raised on the boat to avoid rain and sun. Some women even put their children on the boat, transplanting rice while taking care of their children. In short, the hard work of transplanting rice is very different from the past. This is truly a wonderful thing.
    Walking into the comprehensive hall, I unexpectedly discovered from the exhibited pictures that the "rice planting boat" had appeared as early as the Song Dynasty in our country, but it was then called the "yangma" (seedling horse). Xu Guangqi of the Ming Dynasty recorded a passage about the "yangma" from Su Dongpo in "Complete Treatise on Agriculture":
    "When I traveled to Wuchang in the past, I saw farmers riding yangma. Elm and jujube wood are used for the belly to make it slippery; catalpa wood is used for the back to make it light. The belly is like a small boat, with the head and tail raised, and the back is like an inverted tile, so that the thighs can leap in the mud. Bundled straw is tied to the head to bind the seedlings, and a thousand furrows can be traveled in a day. Compared with those who work hunched over, the difference between labor and leisure is immense."
    From this passage, it seems that the making of the "yangma" was exquisite, and even the wood for the bottom and back of the boat was treated differently, which shows that improving the conditions of rice transplanting labor has been a common desire of farmers throughout the ages.
    However, this kind of "yangma" was not popularized, and eventually disappeared. Even in the rural areas of Wuchang, which Su Dongpo mentioned, it was gone.
    I calculated the years. What Su Dongpo saw was the rural situation during the Jiayou period of the Northern Song Dynasty, which is now nine hundred years ago. The farmer’s desire to improve the conditions of rice transplanting labor was like a flash in the pan, disappearing in an instant. From then on, the vast majority of farmers transplanted rice with their hands and feet in the mud, their backs to the sky, for one hundred years, two hundred years...
    However, this spring, in just about a month, the "rice planting boat" appeared in the new society, and was subsequently promoted in vast areas of Guangdong, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Hunan, and Fujian. Yesterday’s news in this newspaper from Zhejiang said: "Sitting on boats to transplant rice can be seen everywhere in the Hangjiahu area and the coastal plains of eastern Zhejiang. Tens of thousands of rice planting boats are floating in the fields like ducks, and the male and female commune members sitting at the bow of the boat are transplanting rice easily and happily."
    Seeing this and looking back at the past, one cannot help but think: Why is the fate of the "yangma" created by farmers nine hundred years ago so different from that of the "rice planting boat" created by farmers today? One was obscure, self-generated, and self-extinguished; while the other is smooth sailing and blooming everywhere.
    People may have many answers. However, the historical changes of the small "rice planting boat" show us that under the old social system, during the era of feudal landlord class rule, improving the labor conditions of farmers was never paid attention to, and the small and reasonable wishes of farmers had no conditions to be realized. Even if the farmers themselves made slight improvements, they would not receive support. But today, things have completely changed: the "yangma" that has been forgotten by people has been created again in a new form—the "rice planting boat." Any tool that can improve labor conditions is immediately supported and concerned by the Party, and is quickly promoted. This is precisely the characteristic of our socialist system!

    由“插秧船”想起的
    何卓
    稍为熟悉农事活动的人都知道在种植水稻当中，插秧活是最艰苦的劳动。这次我在全国农具展览会上看到了广东新会县农民创造的“插秧船”，制作很简单，每只造价不过四元；农民坐在上面插秧再不用整日手脚在地、背朝天地干活。船上还可张起布篷或插上雨伞以避免雨淋日晒，有些妇女还把小孩放在船上，一面插秧一面照看孩子。一言以蔽之，艰苦的插秧活同过去大不相同了。这真是再好不过的事。
    走到综合馆里，我从展出的画片上意外地发现早在我国宋代就曾出现过“插秧船”，不过那时叫“秧马”。明人徐光启在“农政全书”里记了一段苏东坡关于“秧马”的话：
    “予昔游武昌，见农夫皆骑秧马。以榆棘为腹，欲其滑；以楸梧为背，欲其轻。腹如小舟，昂其首尾，背如复瓦，以便两髀雀跃于泥中。系束藁其首以缚秧，日行千畦，较之伛偻而作者，劳佚相绝矣。”
    从这段话看来，“秧马”制作是讲究的，连船底船背的木料都作了不同的处理，足见改善插秧劳动的条件是古今农民共同的愿望。
    但是，这种“秧马”没有推广开来，而且终于绝迹了，就是苏东坡说的武昌农村也没有了。
    我算了一算年代，苏东坡所看见的是北宋嘉佑年间农村的事，距今已经九百年。农民改善插秧劳动条件的愿望真像是昙花一现，转眼消逝。从此以后，广大农民又是手脚在地背朝天插秧，一百年，两百年……
  　然而，今年春天只不过一个月左右，“插秧船”在新社会出现了，跟着在广东、广西僮族自治区、湖南、福建广大地区推广开来。昨日本报登的浙江消息说：“坐船插秧在杭嘉湖地区和浙东沿海平原地区到处可以看到。几万只插秧船像鸭子一样在田野里浮动着，坐在船头的男女社员轻松愉快地插秧。”
    看到这些，回想过去，便不由引起人思索：为什么九百年前农民创造的“秧马”和今天农民创造的“插秧船”遭遇悬殊，一个是默默无闻，自生自灭；而另一个却是一帆风顺，遍地开花。
    人们也许有着许多的答案。但是，小小“插秧船”的历史变化却向我们说明了在旧社会制度下面，在封建地主阶级统治时代，改善农民的劳动条件是从来不被注意的，农民的微小的合理愿望是没有条件实现的，即使农民自己稍有改进也是得不到支持的。而在今天，事情却完全变了样：已经被人们遗忘了的“秧马”，又以新的形式——“插秧船”被创造出来了；任何能够改善劳动条件的工具一旦出现，便立刻受到党的支持和关注，且迅速地推广开来，这正是我们社会主义制度的特点啊！（附图片）
