    Timely Sowing, Careful Management

    Shaanxi Wheat Harvest Is a Foregone Conclusion

    (Our Dispatch) This year, the 24 million mu of wheat in Shaanxi Province are growing better than in any previous year, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion. According to predictions, the total wheat output of the province may reach about 5 billion jin, exceeding the original target by 12.4%, and 51.5% higher than the total wheat output of the province last year.

    The prevalence of large-scale high-yield fields and high-yield plots is a prominent feature this year. The more than 6 million mu of large-scale high-yield fields cultivated in 50 counties and cities including Lintong, Weinan, and Xianyang have an average yield of over 300 jin per mu. This year, the number of mu or plots of thousand-jin high-yield wheat that have appeared in various places has exceeded that of the past. The three mu of high-yield experimental fields of the Dongzi Commune in Chaoyi County have all produced 1,600 jin. The Maoerdong Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs of Xi'an this year saw 11 mu of high-yield fields, with a yield of 1,700 jin per mu.

    The reason why winter wheat in Shaanxi Province can achieve an unprecedented bumper harvest this year is inseparable from the great leap forward in agricultural production. During the wheat sowing and growing season, the farmers of the province strengthened field management of wheat with revolutionary vigor and paid attention to improving wheat cultivation techniques and management methods. Last year, there was almost no rain for nearly three months before sowing wheat, and the drought was particularly severe. The vast number of farmers persisted in using various methods such as moisture conservation to ensure wheat sowing. When sowing, most of the wheat fields used improved varieties and were generally densely planted. Farmers in the Guanzhong and Hanzhong areas irrigated more than 8 million mu of wheat fields with irrigation conditions one to three times; there are many places in the Weibei Plateau and northern Shaanxi mountains where irrigation is not yet possible, and in the past, the masses did not have the habit of watering, but in the sound of the great leap forward in agricultural production, they also carried water with unparalleled vigor, either by human or animal power, to irrigate the wheat fields. Farmers in the Yulin area moved 1.18 billion jin of ice to irrigate 190,000 mu of wheat fields. Farmers everywhere have applied sufficient topdressing fertilizer to the wheat fields, and the amount of topdressing fertilizer applied is generally about 50% higher than last year.

    Counties that were once considered to have low yields have also caught up with the advanced counties in this year's great leap forward in agricultural production. The wheat yield in Zhouzhi County has been declining year by year for several years. Therefore, it was criticized at the special commissioner and county head conference held in the province this year. After the leading comrades of Zhouzhi County returned, they immediately took strong measures. The provincial leadership also strengthened its leadership over the county, and as a result, they launched the first shot of the leap forward, making the average yield of 350,000 mu of wheat in the county reach more than 300 jin per mu.

    At present, a small part of the wheat in southern Shaanxi Province has begun to be harvested. The wheat-reaping birds have also come to the towering poplar trees in the main wheat-producing areas of Guanzhong, and the farmers in this area are also about to begin harvesting. In order to achieve fast harvesting, clean threshing, good storage, high yields, and avoid all losses such as shattering, lodging, and mildew, agricultural cooperatives in various places have generally formulated summer harvest and summer planting plans. Based on the characteristics that the wheat grows well this year, the yield is high, and the labor required for harvesting is greater than in previous years, socialist mass cooperation is now being organized everywhere. While extensively creating, imitating, and promoting summer harvest and summer planting tools, they are also training farm tool operators to improve labor efficiency and shorten the time for wheat harvesting and threshing. Many counties are trying their best to advance the work that can be done in the summer harvest so as to ensure that both summer harvest and summer planting are not delayed.

### 播种及时  管理周到  陕西小麦丰收成定局

    播种及时  管理周到
    陕西小麦丰收成定局
    本报讯　陕西省今年的二千四百万亩小麦生长得比以往任何一年都好，丰收已成定局。根据预测全省小麦总产量可达五十亿斤左右，超过原订指标12.4％，比去年全省小麦总产量高51.5％。
    大面积丰产田和高额丰产地块多，是今年突出的特点。临潼、渭南和咸阳等五十县市培育的六百多万亩大面积丰产田，平均亩产达到三百斤以上。今年各地出现的千斤丰产麦，无论亩数或块数都超过了以往，朝邑县洞子社的三亩高额丰产试验田产量都在一千六百斤。西安市郊区帽?冢农业社，今年出现了十一亩高额丰产田，亩产一千七百斤。
    陕西省今年的冬小麦能获得空前丰收的原因，是和农业生产大跃进分不开的。在小麦播种和生长期间，全省农民鼓起了革命干劲加强小麦的田间管理，并注意了改进小麦栽培技术和管理方法。去年在播种小麦前，有近三个月没有下雨，旱象特别严重。广大农民坚持用提墒、保墒等各种办法，使小麦得到了播种。在下种时，绝大部分麦田都使用了良种，并普遍进行了密植。关中和汉中地区的农民给八百多万亩有灌溉条件的麦田浇过一至三遍水；渭北高原和陕北山区有许多还没有条件灌溉的地方，已往群众也没有浇水的习惯，但是，在农业生产大跃进声中也以无比的干劲，用人担、牲口驮水的办法，对麦田进行了灌溉。榆林专区的农民搬冰十一亿八千万斤，灌了十九万亩麦田。各地农民都给麦田上饱了追肥，施追肥的数量一般都比去年增加约达50％以上。
    一向被认为产量低的县，在今年农业生产大跃进中，也赶上了先进县。盩厔县的小麦产量几年来年年下降，因此在今年全省召开的专员县长会议上受到了批评。盩厔县的领导同志回去后，立即采取了有力的措施。省级领导机关也加强了对该县的领导，结果打响了跃进的第一炮，使全县三十五万亩小麦，平均每亩都达到了三百斤以上。
    现在，陕西省南部的少部分小麦已经开始收割，关中主要产麦区的收麦鸟也来到了高耸的白杨树梢，这个地区的农民也即将开始收割。为了做到收得快、打得净、藏的好、丰产丰收、避免落粒掉枝、发霉等一切损失，目前，各地农业社已经普遍制定夏收夏种计划。根据今年麦子长得好，产量高，收获比往年所需劳动力大的特点，现在各地正在组织社会主义大协作。并一面广泛地创造、仿制和推广夏收夏播工具，一面训练农具手，提高劳动效率，缩短麦收和脱粒的时间。许多县都把夏收能做的活尽量提前，做到夏收夏种两不误。
