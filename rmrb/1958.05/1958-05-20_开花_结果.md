　　Flowering and Fruiting
  　Tun Sheng
    "Spring flowers, summer fruits" is the general development process of plants. Flowers mostly bloom in the bright spring. Flowers are divided into hermaphroditic flowers (having both stamens and pistils in the same flower) and unisexual flowers (having only pistils without stamens, or only stamens without pistils). Among unisexual flowers, some are dioecious, and some are monoecious. When female and male flowers are in full bloom, due to the force of wind or the guidance of insects, pollen from the stamens is scattered from the anthers to the stigma of the pistil. This is called "pollination." After pollination, the corolla of the (female flower) gradually withers, and the ovary gradually enlarges. After a considerable period of development, generally in summer, plump fruits are formed. Those formed by the ovary are called true fruits, such as peaches and plums; those formed by the enlargement of the calyx and receptacle are called false fruits, such as pears and apples.

    Sometimes, although plants bloom a lot, they bear few fruits. What is the reason for this? Generally speaking, it is caused by the influence of the external environment, resulting in uneven pollination. In order to increase yield and ensure abundant fruit, artificial assisted pollination is required. For example, after applying artificial pollination to crops such as sunflowers and corn, the effect is very good.

    The fruiting of plants is mainly to reproduce their offspring. However, some plants only bloom but do not bear fruit (such as camellias and osmanthus), because the ovary degenerates or some physiological state hinders pollination. Their propagation must be carried out by artificial cutting, grafting, division and other methods.

　　开花·结果
  　屯生
    “春花、夏果”，是一般植物发育的过程。花，大都开在明媚的春天。花有两性花（同一花中具有雄蕊和雌蕊）和单性花（只有雌蕊而没有雄蕊，或只有雄蕊而没有雌蕊）的分别。单性花中有的是雌雄异株，有的雌雄同株。当雌花和雄花盛开的时候，由于风力或昆虫的引导，使雄蕊上的花粉从花药中散到雌蕊的柱头上去，这就是“授粉”。受粉后（雌花）花冠渐渐雕萎，子房逐渐膨大，经过相当时间发育，一般到了夏季，就形成了丰满的果实。由子房形成的称为真果，如桃、李等；由花萼和花托肥大而成的称假果，如梨、苹果等。
    有时植物虽然开花很多，但结果很少，这是什么缘故呢？一般说来，是因为外界环境影响，授粉不匀所造成。为了提高产量，保证果实丰硕，就须人工辅助授粉。例如向日葵、玉蜀黍等作物施用人工授粉后，效果很好。
    植物的结果，主要是为了繁衍它的后代。但是有的植物单开花不结果（如山茶、桂花等），这是因为子房退化或某种生理状态妨碍了受粉的缘故。它们的繁殖必须用人工插枝、嫁接、分株等方法来进行。
