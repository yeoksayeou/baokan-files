    Warrior's Joy
    The newly launched "Warrior Life" column in the People's Daily has been deeply welcomed by the soldiers. When the first article depicting the life of soldiers appeared on the fourth page, some warriors could not restrain the joy in their hearts and said happily: "Look! The People's Daily also publishes stories about us soldiers!"
    From then on, the soldiers became even more enthusiastic about reading the newspaper. Every time the People's Daily was delivered to the company, everyone rushed to read it, afraid of missing a single article published in this column. During club activities in the evening, the soldiers automatically sat around the newspaper reader, greedily listening to every sentence and every word, reading it once and then again.
    The soldiers have a request: not only do they need to understand the colorful lives of border guards, but they also hope to publish more character sketches with new qualities, as well as the lives of soldiers in various services.

    战士的喜悦
    最近人民日报新开辟的“战士生活”一栏，深受广大士兵的欢迎。当第一篇描写战士生活的文章出现在第四版上后，有的战士抑制不住内心的喜悦，高兴地说：“看！人民日报也登载咱们战士的事啦！”
    从这以后，战士们看报纸的劲头就更足了。每逢人民日报送到连队后，个个都争先抢着看，恐怕漏看了本栏内所刊登的每一篇文章。到了晚上俱乐部活动时间，战士们都自动地坐在读报员的周围，贪婪地倾听着每一句、每一个字，读完一遍还要再读一遍。
    战士们有一个要求：不仅需要了解边防战士的多彩生活，同时，也希望多刊登一些具有新品质的人物特写，还有各兵种的战士生活。
