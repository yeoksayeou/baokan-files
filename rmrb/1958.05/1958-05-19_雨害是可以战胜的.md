Rain Damage Can Be Overcome
　　Lu Wancheng

    China's main wheat-producing areas are at the beginning of the rainy season during the wheat harvest. According to long-term rainfall records in Beijing, Anyang, Jinan, Suxian, and other places, the rainfall in June is one to three times higher than in May. In some wheat-producing areas, the number of rainy days has also increased during this period. The average number of rainy days during the wheat harvest on the Huanghuai Plain accounts for about a quarter of the time. In 1956, the wheat harvest in the Guanzhong and Southern Shaanxi regions of Shaanxi Province began on June 5th, with continuous rain for a week. In Hebei Province in 1956, most areas experienced continuous rainfall of over 100 millimeters during the wheat ripening period, with some areas reaching 200 to 300 millimeters. In that year, Henan, Anhui, Shanxi, Jiangsu, and other provinces lost about 5 billion catties of wheat due to rain damage. In 1957, many places were also threatened by cloudy and rainy weather during the wheat harvest.
    Continuous rain brings great difficulties to the wheat harvest. Wind and rain can not only cause wheat to fall in patches, making it difficult to harvest, but can even cause the ears of wheat to germinate and rot. The masses in Shaanxi, Henan, and other places compare harvesting wheat to "snatching food from the dragon's mouth," which refers to the fact that the wheat harvest is a serious struggle against rain damage.
      "Forewarned is forearmed" is also very applicable here. During the wheat harvest season, seizing the opportunity to harvest as soon as it ripens, before it rains, and threshing as soon as it is harvested is the fundamental way to prevent rain damage. When carrying out this kind of harvesting, it is necessary to arrange the order of priority according to the different growth conditions of the wheat. Harvesting the good wheat first and then the less good wheat is the general practice in many wheat-producing areas. For varieties with short dormancy periods that are prone to germination when it rains, such as "Bima No. 1," "Bima No. 4," "Xinong 6028," "Baiyupi," "Nanda 2419," and "Zhongnong 28," harvesting should also begin first. Wheat in river滩地 and low-lying, flood-prone areas should also be harvested first.
    "Counting half at the threshing ground, it only counts when it's in the granary." In addition to paying attention to rushing to harvest and transport, it is also necessary to seize the time to thresh. In 1956, many places suffered great losses because they did not have enough threshing grounds and delayed threshing, failing to thresh as soon as they harvested. In order to speed up threshing, it is beneficial to have slightly larger and more numerous threshing grounds. In 1956, the Wujiazhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Hebei Province lost 60,000 catties of wheat due to rain damage because of the small and insufficient threshing grounds, which prevented timely threshing. In 1957, this cooperative learned from the previous year's experience and expanded the threshing grounds, ensuring timely threshing.
    Stacking is also a very important part of rushing to harvest. Wheat that has been transported to the threshing ground but cannot be threshed immediately should be stacked in high places, covered tightly, and protected from wind and rain.
    It is common for continuous rain to occur during the wheat harvest season. In this case, emergency measures should be taken, organizing all labor and using all harvesting tools to rush to harvest in the rain. Because the wheat grains are prone to germinate on the ears or rot on the ground due to continuous rainy days, there will be great losses if they are not harvested. In this case, how should we harvest? According to the experience of Henan, Shaanxi, and other places, in continuous rainy weather, it is best to cut off the ears of wheat with short stalks of five or six inches so that they can be bundled, dried, and threshed indoors and outdoors. In 1956, the Liming Cooperative in Queshan, Henan, quickly completed the rush harvesting work using this method, reducing the loss of 120,000 catties of wheat. Wheat that has already been harvested but has not been transported back in time can also be threshed by chopping off the ears and transporting them back. In 1956, farmers in Xihua County, Henan, used this method to increase threshing efficiency by two-thirds. Wheat that cannot be chopped in time should also be rushed back and dried in any sheltered place. Using door panels to beat or manually rub the ears to thresh is also a good way to deal with wet wheat.
    The threshed wet wheat still has the possibility of germination and mold, so it must be dried using hot pits and pots. This method is suitable for decentralized implementation. If the wet wheat can be distributed to the members according to the pre-distribution plan, it can be divided into smaller units.
    Farmers in all wheat-producing areas have rich experience in fighting rain damage. After cooperativization, various places have also created many methods for collective rush harvesting. As long as the masses are mobilized and vigilance is heightened, rain damage can be overcome.

　　雨害是可以战胜的
　　路万程
    我国小麦主要产区在麦收时期正是雨季开始。据北京、安阳、济南、宿县等地多年来长期雨量记载，6月降雨量比5月增加一到三倍。有些麦产区，在这个阶段降雨日数也增多了。黄淮平原麦收时期平均降雨日即占四分之一左右。1956年陕西省关中、陕南地区麦收时期从6月5日开始，连续降雨一个星期。河北省1956年在麦熟期间一般地区连续降雨一百公厘以上，有些地区达到二、三百公厘。这年河南、安徽、山西、江苏等省因雨害损失小麦五十亿斤左右。1957年也有不少地方，在麦收时期受到阴雨的威胁。
    霪雨给麦收带来的困难是很大的。风雨不仅能使小麦成片倒伏，难于收刈，甚至能使麦穗发芽霉烂。陕西、河南等地群众把收麦比喻为“龙口夺食”，就是指的：麦收是一场向雨害的严重斗争。
      “未雨绸缪”在这里也是很适用的。在麦收季节里抓紧在没有下雨以前，熟一块，收一块，随收随打是防止雨害的根本办法。进行这样收割的时候要按小麦不同的生长情况，排出主、次、先、后。先收好麦，后收次麦，是许多麦区的一般作法。对于休眠期短，遇雨容易发芽的品种，如“碧蚂1号”“碧蚂4号”“西农6028”“白玉皮”“南大2419”“中农28”等，也要先动手收割。对于沿河滩地和低洼易涝地的小麦，也应当争取先收。
    “上场算一半，入仓才能算”。除了注意抢收快运以外，还要抓紧打场。1956年许多地方因为打麦的场院不够和拖延了打场时间，没有随收随碾，遭到很大损失。为了加速打麦，场地的面积稍大一点，数量稍多一些是有好处的。河北省吴家庄农业社1956年由于场地少，面积小，不能及时脱粒，被雨损害小麦六万斤。1957年这个社吸取前一年的教训，扩大了麦场，保证了碾麦及时。
    堆垛也是抢收当中的一件很重要的事情。运到场上不能立即打场脱粒的小麦，要选择高地垛好，苫严，防止风吹雨淋。
    麦收季节阴雨连绵是常有的事情。在这种情况下，应采取紧急措施，组织所有劳力，利用一切收获工具，冒雨抢收。因为连日阴雨，麦粒容易在穗上发芽，或倒在地上沤坏，不抢收回来，就会损失很大。在这种情况下怎样收割呢？根据河南、陕西等地经验，在不断阴雨中，最好割下带五六寸短秆的麦穗，以便在室内外捆束晾晒和脱粒。1956年河南确山黎明社采用这种办法很快完成抢收工作，少损失十二万斤小麦。已经收割未能及时运回的麦子，也可以采取铡下麦穗，运回脱粒的办法。1956年河南西华县农民用这个办法，提高打场效率三分之二。来不及铡穗的小麦也应当抢运回来，利用一切避雨的地方架起风干。利用门板摔打或用人工搓穗脱粒，也是处理淋湿麦子的一个好办法。
    已经脱粒的湿麦子仍有生芽、发霉的可能，因此必须利用热坑和锅等把湿麦子烘干。这种办法，适宜分散进行，如能根据预分方案，把湿麦子分配给社员，就可以化整为零了。
    各产麦区的农民都有和雨害作斗争的丰富经验，合作化以后，各地在集体抢收方面也创造了很多办法，只要发动群众，提高警惕，雨害是可以战胜的。
