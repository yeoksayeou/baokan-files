Strive to Complete the Task of Eliminating Illiteracy More Quickly
Acting Director of the Second Office of the State Council Zhang Jichun
　　The work of eliminating illiteracy has greatly developed since last winter and this spring, but this development is very uneven. Some have progressed very quickly, while others have progressed quite slowly. According to some local situations we have recently encountered, the work of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people can and should be accelerated. The reason why it can be accelerated is very clear:

　　Craving Food Like the Hungry, Thirst Like the Thirsty

　　First of all, the masses demand acceleration. Everyone knows that the pain of being illiterate and uncultured has existed for a long time. Before liberation, the masses could not even imagine solving this problem. Although there have been great changes in this regard in the eight years since liberation, the problem has not been fundamentally solved, so the demands of the masses are still very strong. After cooperativization, ownership changed accordingly, and the masses were further liberated, but the difficulties of illiteracy and low cultural level still exist. Not only is it difficult to learn politics and technology, but it is also very inconvenient to calculate one's labor points and handle one's family life. The masses have seen with their own eyes the many conveniences that literate and cultured people have in learning and working, while they lack these conditions. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the continuous improvement of production tools and technology, have further compelled the workers and peasants to realize the urgency and importance of learning culture and technology, and the important significance of culture and technology for building socialism and creating a happier life for themselves in the future. Therefore, the masses say: "Socialism is heaven, and without culture, you can't get there," and they are even more eager to eliminate illiteracy and learn culture.

　　Do the masses have any opinions about our past literacy work? We have indeed done a lot of work in the past few years and achieved certain results, helping the masses to eliminate a large number of illiterate people, and many people have also risen to the state of semi-illiteracy, which has fairly satisfied some of the demands of the masses. According to statistics from Dengfeng County, Henan Province, out of more than 84,000 illiterate and semi-illiterate people in the county, more than 30,000 illiterate and semi-illiterate people were eliminated through efforts before the winter of 1957. However, literacy work was not grasped tightly enough, sometimes tight and sometimes loose, and like other undertakings, it also took a tortuous path. The "anti-rash advance" in 1953 and 1956 also suffered setbacks and slowed down its speed. Therefore, the masses still have criticisms of our work. They say: "Winter schools are held every year, and we learn from scratch every year; three words a day, where is the time to grind?" They also said: "Full house in winter, half in spring; in summer and autumn, it's gone." "Literacy is eliminated every year, and every year is illiteracy." The masses in Dengfeng County even modified the last sentence of the county party committee's proposal of "learn more during the slack season, learn less during the busy season, and suspend during the very busy season" to "continue to learn during the very busy season." This means that the masses have opinions and criticisms about our lack of tight grasp, the interruption of literacy work at any time, and the overly slow progress. The masses demand more, faster, better, and more economical, all at once. Some comrades said: The masses' demand to get rid of the pain of illiteracy and lack of culture is like being hungry for food and thirsty for drink. This may seem a bit exaggerated, but it basically corresponds to the feelings of the majority of the masses.

　　Ten Thousand People Teach, Everyone Learns

　　Secondly, there are possible conditions for acceleration. Speaking of conditions, the first is that there are many illiterate people. Is there anyone to teach? Since liberation, my country's primary and secondary schools have greatly developed, and the number of primary and secondary school students has greatly increased. (If the development of universities and colleges is included, it will be even more.) Due to the development of amateur cultural education, the literacy work and cultural improvement work of general workers, peasants, cadres, and young workers and peasants have also achieved certain results. Many people have either been eliminated from illiteracy or have improved their culture. In addition to intellectuals before liberation, the number of intellectuals and literate people is even greater. The ratio of non-illiterate people to illiterate people has changed greatly. According to what is already known, some areas have an average of two people teaching one person, some have an average of one person teaching one person, and at most, an average of one person teaches two people (there are of course differences between cities and rural areas). Many places have mobilized and organized all literate people to participate in this work. Their slogan is "Ten thousand people teach, everyone learns." Therefore, the problem of whether there is anyone to teach does not exist. The question is how to organize and use these forces. The second is the question of time, that is, whether the people who teach have time to teach and the people who learn have time to learn. According to the work experience of Dengfeng County and some cities and counties that have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, this problem is not difficult to solve, because they implement the mass line in the literacy movement, and the method adopted is mass-based, universally unfolded, and organized literacy work. It is not a quiet activity for a few people. The learning organization is consistent with the production organization (the production team in rural areas). They use the gaps in production every day to study. The learning place is not limited to the room, but is often outdoors, in the fields and on construction sites. Therefore, learning becomes a rest from production labor, and production labor becomes a rest from learning. Each learner has someone to teach, and each teacher has a guaranteed teaching target. This method can insist on regular learning and avoid interrupting learning. Adopt the method of gradually expanding from point to surface, starting from the completion of a production team and a village, and gradually entering the completion of a commune, a township, and a county. In terms of learning content, it can be closely combined with the content of production labor, and closely combined with learning politics and learning technology. Practice learning what you do. Their learning texts are full of words and sentences such as "corn hybridization," "granular fertilizer," "eliminate the four pests, sparrows, rats, mosquitoes, and flies," "repair water conservancy," "soil and water conservation," "cultural emancipation," "socialist leap forward," "afforestation of the motherland," "conquering nature," "deep plowing," "sowing," "topdressing," "diseases and insect pests," "man-made satellites," "rockets," "agricultural development program," and "labor work points." You say it is a cultural textbook, but it is also a political textbook and a technical textbook, because when teaching, it is not just teaching culture, but also teaching politics and technology. The three are closely integrated. The masses say this is "three-in-one" teaching. It is not for culture for the sake of culture, or for eliminating illiteracy for the sake of eliminating illiteracy. It is for improving socialist political consciousness and for developing socialist production that illiteracy is eliminated and culture is acquired. It not only does not conflict with production in terms of learning time and learning content, but it can better serve production and cooperate with production. We are often worried that literacy and cultural learning will hinder production, but if this method can be adopted, the contradiction between literacy and production can be avoided, and the worry will be superfluous. To take a step back: If we do not adopt this method, what kind of method should we adopt? Can we expect a more ideal slack season to arrive and then arrange our literacy work? Now it seems that it is not easy to expect such a season regardless of spring, summer, autumn, winter, east, west, north, or south. On the contrary, the past so-called slack seasons have generally become busy seasons. The situation in factories and mines is even more so. Therefore, the mass-based method of carrying out literacy and cultural learning in close combination with production seems to be the most reliable method.

　　The Problem Lies in the Leadership's Determination

　　Since the masses have a high degree of enthusiasm for literacy and cultural learning and demand acceleration, and the possible conditions for acceleration are fully available, and several provinces and cities and a large number of counties and cities have already appeared in the country as precedents for eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, is there any other problem? The problem lies in how the leadership's determination is decided. This is not to say whether the leadership has made a determination and whether there is a determination to eliminate illiteracy. After several years of work practice and the promulgation of the Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft), this problem has basically been solved. Rather, it is a question of whether the determination is a little faster or a little slower, and whether the grasp is a little tighter or a little looser. In other words, it is a question of how much effort is put in. As everyone knows, the Agricultural Development Program draft stipulates that illiteracy among young and middle-aged people will be basically eliminated within twelve years. In March of this year, the Central Committee, in forwarding the instructions of the Jiangsu Provincial People-run Agricultural Middle School, pointed out that "strive to eliminate illiteracy in rural areas in five to seven years." If we take the Central Committee's instructions in March of this year as a benchmark, and calculate from 1956, it will be seven years by 1962, five years from now, and five years by 1960, three years from now. But this is in terms of the national scope and the longest time. If it is for each province, city, prefecture, county, especially each district, township, commune, village, factory, mine, agency, and military unit, it is not necessary to wait for three to five years. The Central Committee's instructions say "strive," which means that, like the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, there must be an active plan and measures to strive for. Without an active plan and measures to strive for, it is impossible to expect to complete it. Reaching the level of being able to recognize and use more than 1,500 commonly used characters in more than 80% of young and middle-aged people is a common goal of literacy, and it takes a considerable struggle process to achieve it. Therefore, it is beneficial to be vigilant about time.

　　According to the experience of Dengfeng County and other places, the main thing is that the secretary personally takes action, the whole party and the whole people are mobilized, and with industrial and agricultural production as the center, while industrial and agricultural production is leaping forward, a great leap forward in literacy is launched, and a mass movement to eliminate illiteracy and learn culture is set off. The high tide of the national movement mobilizes all illiterate and semi-illiterate people among young and middle-aged people and all literate people to fight for the elimination of illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. In practical work, while arranging industrial and agricultural production, we must always pay attention to putting literacy and cultural learning on the agenda and arranging them together, instead of simply entrusting them to the competent authorities.

　　Strengthen political and ideological work in literacy. In view of the ideological situation of cadres and the masses, launch some mass ideological debates on literacy issues among the masses at the right time to clarify the doubts and other incorrect ideas that a few people have about literacy work and improve the masses' understanding. For example, some people still think that the workload of literacy work is too large and that there is a great contradiction with production. They doubt the possibility of completion, or they fundamentally deny the necessity of literacy work, thinking that it is more reliable to popularize primary school education and fundamentally cut off the source of new illiteracy rather than carrying out literacy work for young and middle-aged people. And they ignore the fully possible conditions and importance of eliminating illiteracy among a large number of young and middle-aged people at present. They do not know that eliminating illiteracy and popularizing primary schools are important goals of the cultural revolution and are tasks that must be carried out simultaneously and cannot be neglected.

　　In order to promote the full development of the literacy movement, the leadership should attach importance to the experience of literacy work in every village, commune, township, county, workshop, factory, mine, agency, and military unit. In particular, attention should be paid to summing up and promoting the advanced experience among them. At the same time, some appropriate encouragement methods should also be adopted to promote the entire movement. For example, as some places in Henan Province have done, when a village, commune, or township completes the literacy task, in addition to holding on-site meetings, conducting seminars to study and compare achievements and experiences, a celebration meeting is also held to celebrate the local literacy victory and cultural emancipation. What we saw in some areas of Henan was that not only a village, a township, or a factory and mine held a celebration meeting when the young and middle-aged people there completed literacy, but they also beat gongs and drums, set up flags and decorations, and reported the good news to the government. Some even issued a certificate of "Illiteracy-Free Glorious Household" to a family when the young and middle-aged men and women in that family eliminated illiteracy, and posted it on the door or in the hall. Some areas (such as Changge, Henan) also issued awards to models who have worked particularly hard and actively promoted the learning of others in literacy and have achieved results. These measures are very meaningful and have a great inspirational effect on the mass literacy movement. From being blind to eliminating illiteracy, from being bound by culture to mastering the tools of culture, this is not an ordinary victory, it is cultural emancipation, it is a great revolutionary victory. It is understandable that the masses are overjoyed.

　　Eliminating illiteracy, as Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report, is one of the important goals of the cultural revolution. It is closely related to the development of the entire cultural and educational cause, changing the spiritual outlook of the masses, realizing the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, promoting industrial and agricultural production, and accelerating socialist construction. Therefore, in the leap forward of socialist economic construction, in the struggle of the cultural revolution and the technological revolution, grasping literacy work, making more active plans, taking more effective measures, and striving to solve this urgent task in a shorter and faster time is of great significance and impact.

　　争取较快地完成扫盲任务
　　国务院第二办公室代理主任　张际春
    扫除文盲的工作在去冬今春以来有很大的发展，但是这种发展很不平衡，有的进展得很快，有的就进展得相当慢。根据我们最近接触到的一些地方情况来看，在青壮年中扫除文盲的工作是可以加快和能够加快的。它之所以能够加快，道理很明白：
    如饥思食　如渴思饮
    首先是群众要求加快。谁都知道，群众不识字和没有文化的痛苦长时期以来一直存在。解放以前，群众对于这个问题是不能去设想的，解放以后八年来，在这一方面虽然有很大的变化，但是问题还没有得到根本上的解决，因而群众的要求仍然很强烈。合作化以后，所有制随之改变，群众得到了进一步地解放，但是不识字和文化低的困难仍然存在，不但学习政治学习技术有很多困难，就是计算自己的劳动工分和处理自己的家庭生活亦发生很多不便。群众亲眼看到识字人和有文化的人在学习和工作上有着许多的便利条件，而自己却缺乏这种条件。工农业生产大跃进，生产工具和技术不断地改进提高的事实，更加迫使工农群众认识到学习文化技术的迫切性和重要性，认识到文化技术对于建设社会主义、对于创造自己未来更加幸福生活的重要意义。所以群众说：“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”，而更加迫切渴望扫除文盲、学习文化。
    群众对于我们过去的扫盲工作有没有意见呢？几年来我们确是做了不少工作，获得了一定的成绩，帮助群众扫除了一大批文盲，有很多的人也已经上升到半文盲状态，相当地满足了群众一些要求，据河南省登封县的统计，全县八万四千多文盲半文盲中，经过1957年冬季以前的努力，就扫除了三万多文盲半文盲。但是扫盲工作由于抓得不紧，时紧时松，同其它事业一样也走着它迂回曲折的道路，1953年和1956年的“反冒进”，同样受到挫折，放慢了它的速度。因而群众对于我们的工作仍有批评，他们说：“年年办冬学，年年从头学；一日三个字，那有时间磨。”又说：“冬满堂，春一半；入夏秋，就不见。”“年年扫盲，年年是文盲”，登封县的群众甚至把县委提出的“农闲多学，农忙少学，大忙暂停”的意见，把最后一句修改为
  “大忙要继续学”。这就是说，群众对于我们抓得不紧，随时中断扫盲工作，进展过于缓慢有意见，有批评。群众要求多、快、好、省，一气呵成。有同志说：群众要求解除不识字没有文化的苦闷，正像已经到了如饥思食，如渴思饮的地步。这话似乎有点儿形容过分，但是它同群众大多数的心情基本上是相符合的。
    万人教　全民学
    其次是有加快的可能条件。谈到条件，第一是文盲人数很多，有没有人教的问题。解放以后我国的中小学校有很大的发展，中小学生的数量有很大的增加。
  （如果包括大、专学校的发展就更多）由于业余文化教育的开展，一般工农干部和青年工人农民的扫盲工作和提高文化的工作亦得到一定成绩，许多人或者被扫除了文盲或者被提高了文化，加上解放前的知识分子，知识分子和识字的人的数字就更大。非文盲和文盲的比例，有很大的改变。据已经知道的情况，有些地区平均两个人教一人，有些是平均一个人教一人，至多的也只是平均一个人教两个人（城市同农村当然有差别），许多地方曾经动员和组织所有识字的人来参加这个工作，他们的口号是“万人教，全民学。”因此，有没有人教的问题是不存在的，问题是如何去组织和运用这些力量的问题。第二是时间问题，即教的人有没有时间教，学的人有没有时间学的问题：这个问题根据登封县和已经在青壮年中基本扫除了文盲的一些市、县的工作经验来看，也是不难解决的，因为他们实行群众路线的扫盲运动，采取的方法是群众性的普遍展开的有组织的扫盲工作，不是少数人冷清清的活动，学习组织与生产组织（农村是生产队）一致，每天利用生产的空隙进行学习，学习的场所不限于室内，往往是室外，是田间和工地。因而学习变成了生产劳动的休息，生产劳动变成了学习的休息。每个学的人有人教，每个教的人有包教的对象，这种方法能够坚持经常学习，不致于中断学习。采取由点到面，逐步推开的办法，从一个生产队、一个村的完成开始，逐步进到一个社、一个乡、一个县的完成。在学习的内容上，能够与生产劳动的内容密切相结合，与学习政治、学习技术密切相结合。实行做什么学什么，他们学习的课文中充满着“玉米杂交”“颗粒肥料”“除四害、麻雀、老鼠、蚊子、苍蝇”“修水利”“水土保持”“文化翻身”“社会主义跃进”“绿化祖国大地”“征服大自然”“深耕”“播种”“追肥”“病虫害”“人造卫星”“火箭”“农业发展纲要”“劳动工分”等类字句。你说它是文化课本，但是它也是政治课本、技术课本，因为教的时候不只是教文化，同时也教政治和技术，三者是紧密结合在一起的。群众说这是“三合一”的教学。它不是为文化而文化、为扫盲而扫盲，它是为提高社会主义政治觉悟，为发展社会主义生产而扫盲而文化。它无论在学习时间上和学习内容上都不但不与生产发生矛盾，而且它能够更好的服务于生产和配合生产。我们往往担心扫盲和文化学习会妨害生产，但是如果能够采取这种方法，扫盲和生产的矛盾就可以避免了，担心也就多余了。再退一步来说：试想我们如果不采取这种方法，到底采取什么样的方法呢？是不是可以期待一种比较理想的农闲季节到来再安排我们的扫盲工作呢？现在看来无论春夏秋冬和东西南北，都不容易期待那样的季节，相反的，过去的所谓农闲季节，一般的都已经变成为农忙季节了。工矿的情况更是如此。因此，群众性的与生产紧密相结合的进行扫盲、学习文化的方法，看来是一种最可靠的方法。
    问题在于领导决心
    既然群众对于扫盲和学习文化有高度的积极性，要求加快，而加快的可能条件又是充分具备的，并且在全国范围内已经出现了若干省市和大量的县、市在青壮年中扫除文盲的先例，还有什么别的问题呢？问题在于领导的决心如何来决定。这里不是说领导上是否下了决心和有无决心扫除文盲的问题，这个问题，经过几年的工作实践和农业发展纲要（修正草案）公布以后，基本上已经解决了。而是说决心较快一点或者较慢一点，抓得较紧一点或者较松一点的问题。换句话说就是，干劲如何的问题。大家知道，农业发展纲要草案的规定是，在十二年内，基本扫除青壮年中的文盲。今年3月中央在转发江苏省民办农业中学的指示中，又曾经指出“争取在五年到七年消灭农村中的文盲”。如果以中央今年3月指示的意见为基准，从1956年起计算，到1962年就是七年，距现在还有五年，到1960年就是五年，距现在还有三年。但这是就全国范围和最长的时间来说的，如果就每一个省市、专、县，特别是每一个区、乡、社、村和厂矿、机关、部队单位来说，就不一定都要等到三年到五年了。中央的指示中说的是“争取”，这就是说它同工农业生产大跃进一样，必须要有一个积极争取的规划和措施，没有一种积极争取的规划、措施，就不可能预期完成。在80％以上的青壮年中达到能够认识和使用一千五百个以上的常用字，这是扫盲的一个普遍的目标，它要有一个相当的斗争过程，才办得到的，因此，对于时间引起一定的警惕是有益的。
    根据登封县等地的经验，主要的是书记亲自动手，全党全民动员，以工农业生产为中心，在工农业生产跃进的同时，展开一个扫盲大跃进，掀起一个群众性的扫除文盲、学习文化的全民运动的高潮，动员青壮年中一切文盲半文盲和一切识字的人，为扫除青壮年中的文盲而奋斗。在实际工作上，在安排工农业生产的同时，随时注意把扫盲和文化学习工作提到议事日程上来，一并加以安排，不要只是委之于主管部门。
    加强扫盲中的政治思想工作。针对干部和群众的思想情况，在群众中适时展开有关扫盲问题上的某些群众性的思想大辩论，以澄清少数人对于扫盲工作存在的怀疑等不正确的思想，提高群众的认识。例如有的人至今还认为扫盲工作工作量太大，与生产有很大的矛盾，怀疑完成的可能性，或者根本否认扫盲工作的必要，认为与其对青壮年进行扫盲工作，不如普及小学教育，从根本上断绝新盲的来源更为可靠。而忽视当前在大量青壮年中扫除文盲工作充分可能的条件和重要性，不知道扫除文盲和普及小学，都是文化革命的重要目标，是同时并进不能偏废的任务。
    为了推动扫盲运动的充分展开，领导上应当重视每一个村、社、乡、县和车间、厂矿、机关、部队扫盲工作的经验。特别是应当注意把其中先进的经验加以总结推广。同时还应当采取一些适当的鼓励办法来促进整个运动，例如像河南省有些地方作的，当一个村、社、乡扫盲任务完成时，除召开现场会议，进行座谈研究评比成绩经验外，并举行庆祝会，庆祝当地扫盲胜利和文化翻身。我们在河南某些地区看到的是，不但是一个村、一个乡、一个厂矿，当那里的青壮年完成扫盲时举行庆祝会，敲锣打鼓张旗结彩向政府报喜，有的甚至当某一户男女青壮年扫除文盲时，亦发给一张“无盲光荣户”的证书，张贴在门口或堂屋上。有些地区（如河南长葛）对于在扫盲中某些特别努力苦学而又积极推动别人学习获有成绩的模范并发给一种奖状。这些措施很有意义，它对群众扫盲运动，有很大的鼓舞作用。群众由睁眼瞎子到扫除文盲，由受文化的束缚到掌握文化的工具，这不是通常的胜利，是文化翻身，是伟大的革命胜利。群众欢欣若狂是可以理解的。
    扫除文盲，正如少奇同志报告中所指出的，这是文化革命重要目标之一。它与发展整个文化教育事业，改变群众的精神面貌，实现文化革命技术革命，推进工农业生产，加速社会主义建设等根本任务紧密相联系，因此，在社会主义经济建设的跃进中，在文化革命、技术革命的斗争中，抓紧扫盲工作，作出更积极的规划，采取更有效的措施，争取在较短较快的时间内解决这一个迫切任务，它的意义和影响是巨大的。
