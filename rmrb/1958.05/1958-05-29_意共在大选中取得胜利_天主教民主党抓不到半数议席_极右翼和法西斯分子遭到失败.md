Xinhua News Agency, Rome, 28th: The Italian parliamentary elections were held on the 25th and 26th. According to the final election results published on the 27th, the Italian Communist Party and the Socialist Party achieved victory.

Despite the ruling Christian Democratic Party's efforts to oppose communism with the blatant support of the church, the Italian Communist Party gained more than 500,000 votes in this election compared to the last one. The Socialist Party also made progress. Although the Christian Democratic Party also strengthened its position, its long-planned attempt to obtain an absolute majority in parliament to implement ecclesiastical rule was far from realized. The far-right royalists and fascists suffered defeats.

The Italian Communist Party's Senate candidates increased their share of the total vote from 20.2% in the last election to 21.8%, and the House of Representatives candidates increased their share from 22.5% to 22.7%.

In the newly elected total of 596 members of the House of Representatives, the Communist Party now holds 140 seats, the Socialist Party 84 seats, the Social Democratic Party 23 seats, the Christian Democratic Party 273 seats, the Royalists 23 seats, and the Neo-Fascist Party 25 seats.

Currently, in the 246 senators, the Communist Party has 60 seats, the Socialist Party 35 seats, the Social Democratic Party 5 seats, the Christian Democratic Party 122 seats, the Royalists 7 seats, and the Neo-Fascist Party 8 seats.

Western news agencies, in commenting on the results of the Italian general election, did not conceal their disappointment. They pointed out that, according to the election results, the Christian Democratic Party still cannot achieve its goal of forming a one-party government and that its "hopes of establishing a stable government are small."

    意共在大选中取得胜利
    天主教民主党抓不到半数议席　极右翼和法西斯分子遭到失败
    新华社28日讯　罗马消息：意大利议会两院的大选在25日和26日举行。根据27日发表的选举最后结果，意大利共产党和社会党获得了胜利。
    尽管执政的天主教民主党在教会的露骨支持下竭力反共，意大利共产党在这次选举中比上次选举多得了五十多万票。社会党也获得了进展。天主教民主党虽然也加强了它的阵地，但是它预谋已久的企图在议会中取得绝对多数以实行教权统治的计划远远没有实现。极右翼保皇分子和法西斯分子都遭到了失败。
    意大利共产党的参议员候选人所获得的选票从上次选举中占全部选票的20.2％增加到21.8％，众议员候选人所获得选票从上次选举的22.5％增加到22.7％。
    在新选出的总共五百九十六名众议员中，共产党现在占一百四十席，社会党八十四席，社会民主党二十三席，天主教民主党二百七十三席，保皇分子二十三席，新法西斯党二十五席。
    现在在二百四十六名参议员中，共产党有六十席，社会党三十五席，社会民主党五席，天主教民主党一百二十二席，保皇分子七席，新法西斯党八席。
    西方通讯社在评论意大利大选结果时没有掩饰它们的失望，它们指出，根据选举结果，天主教民主党仍然无法实现组织一党政府的目标，它“建立稳定的政府的希望很小”。
