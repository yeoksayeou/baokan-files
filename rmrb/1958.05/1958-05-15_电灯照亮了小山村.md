Electric Lights Illuminate a Small Mountain Village

　　Maple Tree Ridge Village in Dingnan County, Jiangxi Province, with only ten households, is located on a high mountain top. Last winter, Chen Hanwen, who works in Ganzhou, returned home to visit his family and suggested using a canal behind his house to build a hydroelectric power station. Chen Jiazhen, the production team leader (this village is a production team of the Aotou Commune), and commune members Chen Wenxin, Chen Hanting, and others were very interested in this idea. They discussed ways to raise funds with Chen Hanwen and asked him to be responsible for the engineering design and purchasing of machinery. Thus, the plan to build the station was decided.

　　When the masses heard that they could really generate electricity without spending a lot of money and that there would be many benefits, they unanimously expressed their willingness to contribute money and labor. Except for two elderly and widowed households, the remaining eight households raised 375 yuan in one go. The whole village had a total of twenty-two laborers, who said that in addition to doing a good job in production, they would use their rest time in the mornings and evenings to build the station. Once the masses were motivated, the cadres immediately wrote a letter to Chen Hanwen, who had returned to Ganzhou. Chen Hanwen used his spare time to draw up the plans according to the canal's conditions and sent them back. When the plans arrived home, the masses couldn't quite understand them, so they bought a copy of the "Simple Handbook of Electrical Engineering" for reference. They also found five workers from the village who worked in the mines to study together. They basically understood the principles, and then built the machine room and repaired the reservoir according to the plans. Although it was severe cold and heavy snow at that time, everyone was building the station while continuing production. They said, "Let our Chen family ancestors see how capable their descendants are under the leadership of the Communist Party." Before the Spring Festival, the masses had repaired the canal, reservoir, and machine room. A thirty-meter-long wooden pipe to replace the steel pipe was also installed, and more than 800 yuan was raised to buy machinery.

　　After the Spring Festival, Chen Hanwen managed to buy some usable scrap equipment in Ganzhou and assembled a 2-kilowatt generator and a 7-horsepower water turbine. In early March, these machines were transported to Maple Tree Ridge Village, and everyone assembled the machines according to the plans. Fifty-one light bulbs were installed throughout the village. At six o'clock in the afternoon of March 8, electric lights lit up this mountain village for the first time in its history. All forty-plus people in the village jumped for joy. Eighty-six-year-old Granny Liu Dedi, holding her little grandson, said, "I have lived to see good days, and the Communist Party's promise of lighting lamps without oil has truly come true."

　　The completion of a hydroelectric power station by ten households has spread throughout the county. People often come to visit this village.

　　Now, the masses in Maple Tree Ridge Village are installing rice mills and sawmills, using electricity to drive them, so that they can serve production.

　　电灯照亮了小山村
    只有十户人家的江西定南县枫树冈村，在一个高山顶上。去年冬天，在赣州工作的陈汉文回来探家，建议利用屋背后一条水圳来建筑水电站。生产组长（这个村是坳头社的一个生产小组）陈家珍，社员陈文新、陈汉庭等人对这事非常有兴趣，他们和陈汉文商量了筹集资金的办法，并且请陈汉文负责工程设计和购买机器，就这样把建站计划定下来了。
    群众听说当真可以发电，不要花很多钱，又有许多好处，一致表示愿意出钱出力。除两户孤寡外，其余八户一次就筹集了三百七十五元。全村共有二十二个劳动力，他们表示除搞好生产外，要用早晚的休息时间来建站。群众的劲头一来，干部们立即写信告诉已回赣州的陈汉文。陈汉文就利用业余时间根据水圳情况画好了图样寄回来了。图样到了家，群众看不大懂，就买了一本“电工简易手册”来参考，又找本村在矿山工作的五个工人共同研究，基本弄通了道理，就按着图样建机房、修水池。那时虽然是严寒大雪，大家还是边生产、边建站。他们说：“让我们陈家的老祖宗看看，在共产党领导下的后辈子有多大的本事。”到春节前，群众就把水圳、水池、机房都修好了，一根三十公尺长的代替钢管的木水管也安装好了，并且筹好了八百多元买机器的钱。
    春节后，陈汉文在赣州设法买到了还可利用的废旧器材，拼修成一部二千瓦的发电机、一部七马力的水轮机。3月初，这些机器运到了枫树冈村，大家又按照图样把机器装了起来，全村装了五十一个灯头。3月8日下午六点钟，这个山村里有史以来第一次亮起了电灯。全村的四十多个人欢喜得直跳。八十六岁的老婆婆刘德娣抱着小孙子说：“我这一辈子得到了好日子过，共产党讲的点灯不用油当真实现了。”
    十户人家建成水电站，这件事情传遍了全县。经常有人到这个村子来参观。
    现在，枫树冈村的群众正在安装碾米机、锯木机，用电力带动，让它为生产服务。
