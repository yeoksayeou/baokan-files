    Chairman Mao Comes to the Ming Tombs
    Zang Kejia
    Chairman Mao comes to the Ming Tombs,
    The earth trembles when the iron shovel goes down.
    Mountain tops stand tall to watch,
    Mountain torrents shrink their necks when they hear.
    Everyone is excited and overjoyed,
    Everyone's energy gushes like a fountain,
    Labor enthusiasm reaches its peak,
    Chairman Mao comes to the Ming Tombs.

    毛主席来到十三陵
    臧克家毛主席来到十三陵，铁锨下去大地动，山头站在高处望，山洪听了缩脖颈。人人兴奋喜如狂，个个干劲喷泉涌，劳动热情达高潮，毛主席来到十三陵。
