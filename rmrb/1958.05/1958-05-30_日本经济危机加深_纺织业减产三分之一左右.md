Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 28th: Due to the economic recession in Japan and the decrease in exports, seven of the ten largest textile companies in Japan have reduced production by 30% to 40% in the six-month period ending in April of this year. The scale of this production cut is considered the most severe situation the Japanese textile industry has encountered since the war.

After these seven major companies reduced production, the cost of products increased, while product sales continued to decline by 10% to 20% compared to the previous six months.

Japanese economic figures believe that the overproduction of the textile industry is still severe and that it is necessary to further reduce production. From now until the end of October this year, the situation in the Japanese textile industry will not improve.

At the same time, the overproduction situation in the Japanese coal mining industry is also becoming increasingly serious. According to reports, the Japanese Economic Planning Agency has informally decided to have coal mine owners cut production starting in June.

    日本经济危机加深
    纺织业减产三分之一左右
    据新华社28日讯　东京消息：由于日本国内经济衰退和出口减少，日本最大的十家纺织公司中的七家在到今年4月底为止的半年中减产了30％到40％。这次减产的幅度之大被认为是日本纺织业战后以来所遇到的最严重的情况。
    这七家大公司减产以后，产品成本提高了，而产品的销售量仍比前六个月继续下降10％到20％。
    日本经济界人士认为，纺织业生产过剩的情况目前仍然严重，有必要进一步削减生产。从目前到今年10月底为止的六个月中，日本纺织业的情况将不会好转。
    与此同时，日本煤矿业的生产过剩情况也趋于严重。据报道，日本经济企划厅已经非正式决定要各煤矿老板从6月开始削减生产。
