Xinhua News Agency, May 25th. The musicians of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra braved the intense heat this morning to give a splendid hour-and-a-half performance for the builders of the Ming Tombs Reservoir at the construction site.

Before the Soviet musicians arrived at the site, a hall near the construction site was already packed with more than two thousand peasants, soldiers, students, and cadres, with the aisles filled with people. They were all hero models and representatives who had emerged during the construction of the reservoir. Before the concert began, Zhang Junshi, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the construction site, said in his speech that the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir had received enthusiastic assistance from many Soviet experts. Today, the Soviet artists have come to the construction site to perform, which will greatly encourage the reservoir builders. The head of the orchestra, Anosov, also made a brief speech. He said enthusiastically that it was the happiest thing for the Soviet artists to be able to contribute to China's historically significant Great Leap Forward.

The concert began amidst thunderous applause. Anosov and People's Artist of the USSR Ivanov conducted two sets of programs. The Soviet musicians performed seven pieces for the reservoir builders, including works by world-renowned musicians such as Glinka and Tchaikovsky. International competition prize winners Pikaizen and Zekshter gave brilliant violin and trumpet solos respectively. Although Ivanov was covered in sweat after conducting three pieces in a row, he accepted the enthusiastic requests of the reservoir builders and conducted the performance of the Chinese composer He Luting's "Evening Party" once again. When this piece, which depicts the lively scene of the anti-Japanese guerrillas and the people in the rear celebrating together, ended, the entire audience stood up and applauded enthusiastically. The Soviet musicians also stood up and applauded the audience for a long time, and the joyful atmosphere merged the stage and the audience into one.

After the performance, the Soviet artists climbed onto the dam of the reservoir to visit the entire construction site. They were met with enthusiastic applause everywhere they went. When leaving the site, Anosov said to Zhang Junshi that the magnificent construction scene they saw here, which they would never forget, would become a source of inspiration for their artistic creation.

On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, the USSR State Symphony Orchestra also went to the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory to perform for 2,500 textile workers, and was warmly welcomed by the workers. (Attached picture)

    苏联国家交响乐团
    为十三陵水库建设者演出
    新华社25日讯　苏联国家交响乐团的音乐家们今天上午冒着十分炎热的天气，到十三陵水库工地为水库建设者们作了一个半小时的精采演出。
    苏联音乐家们到达工地以前，在工地附近一座礼堂里已经挤满了两千多农民、部队战士、学生和机关干部，连礼堂的走道上都站满了人群。他们都是在水库建设中涌现出来的英雄模范和代表人物。工地副总指挥张俊士在音乐会开始前致词说，十三陵水库建设中曾经得到不少苏联专家的热情帮助。今天苏联艺术家们又深入工地演出，这将给予水库建设者们极大的鼓舞。乐团团长阿诺索夫也作了简短的讲话。他热情地说，苏联艺术家们能够为中国有历史意义的大跃进贡献一分力量，这是他们感到最幸福的事情。
    音乐会在雷鸣般的欢迎掌声中开始。阿诺索夫和苏联人民演员伊万诺夫担任两组节目的指挥。苏联音乐家为水库建设者们演出了包括格林卡、柴可夫斯基等世界著名音乐家的七首乐曲。国际比赛奖金获得者皮卡伊增和泽克什采尔，分别作了精采的小提琴和小号独奏。伊万诺夫在连续指挥演出三首乐曲以后虽已汗流浃背，但他们接受水库建设者们的热情要求，再一次指挥演奏了中国作曲家贺绿汀所作的乐曲“晚会”当这首描写当时抗日游击队战士同后方人民联欢的热闹场景的乐曲演奏结束时，全场起立热烈鼓掌喝采，苏联音乐家们也起立长时间地向听众鼓掌，欢乐的气氛把台上台下融成一体。
    演出结束后，苏联艺术家们登上水库大坝的坝身参观了整个水库工地的建设场面，他们在参观时到处都遇到热情鼓掌的欢迎人群。阿诺索夫在离开工地时对张俊士说，他们在这里看到的永远不能忘记的宏伟的建设情景，将成为他们进行艺术创作的泉源。
    本月23日下午，苏联国家交响乐团还曾到北京棉纺织联合厂为两千五百名纺织工人演出，受到了工人们热情的欢迎。（附图片）
