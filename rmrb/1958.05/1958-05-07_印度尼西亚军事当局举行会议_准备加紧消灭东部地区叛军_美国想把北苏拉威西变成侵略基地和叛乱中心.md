Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - News released by Indonesian military authorities on the 5th indicates that Indonesian government troops will take further military action in the Eastern Indonesia region.

Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution held important meetings on the 2nd and 3rd at the headquarters of the Fifth Military Region in East Java with some leaders of the Eastern Indonesia region. The Army Press Office said that the meetings discussed further actions in the Eastern Indonesia region and the problem of liaison work in the region. Those attending the meeting included Lieutenant Colonel Matallata, Commander of the South and Southeast Sulawesi Defense Zone, Lieutenant Colonel Yusuf, Commander of the Hasanuddin Infantry Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Rukminto, Commander of Operations responsible for suppressing rebels in North Sulawesi and Central Sulawesi, Lieutenant Colonel Kuso Utomo, Commander of the Sixth Military Region (Kalimantan) close to Sulawesi, and Colonel Sabini, Commander of the Fifth Military Region (East Java).

It is reported that troops from the Fifth and Sixth Military Regions are jointly launching an offensive to suppress rebels in Central Sulawesi. The armed forces of the Fifth Military Region have long been conducting sweeps against the local "Islamic Army" in the South and Southeast Sulawesi regions.

Military authorities said that Utomo and Matallata had returned to their respective jurisdictions on the 5th to implement the decisions of the meeting.

The decisions of this meeting are considered very important because the United States is strengthening its assistance to the Sumual-Somba rebel group in North Sulawesi, and even carrying out acts of aggression itself. Aircraft from the United States and its lackey Chiang Kai-shek clique have bombed the Eastern Indonesia region more than once; imperialist submarines and warships are also frequently active there. In North Sulawesi, military personnel and American weapons of the Chiang Kai-shek clique are constantly increasing, and it is particularly noteworthy that the United States and the rebel group are also conspiring to infiltrate the North Maluku region east of Sulawesi.

All these facts show that when the rebels in Central Sumatra are about to be finished, the United States is trying every means to turn North Sulawesi into a solid base for aggression against Indonesia and a new center for rebel activity.

The decision of this important meeting shows that while clearing the remnants of the rebels in Sumatra, the Indonesian government army will pay more attention to the situation in the Eastern Indonesia region, and will take further measures to eliminate the US-backed rebels in North Sulawesi.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th - According to Jakarta newspapers today, order is being rapidly restored in Bukittinggi, which was recovered by the Indonesian government army on the 4th.

It is reported that when the government troops first entered Bukittinggi, the city was silent. But soon after, residents came out to welcome the government troops. Currently, the city's shops have begun to operate, and city traffic has also quickly resumed.

It is reported that the government troops did not encounter any resistance from the rebels when they entered Bukittinggi. Currently, the government troops are continuing to sweep the rebels around Bukittinggi.

At present, the remaining rebel forces are mainly concentrated in Batu Sangkar, 35 kilometers southeast of Bukittinggi, around Lake Singkarak, and in Payakumbuh, east of Bukittinggi. Government troops are advancing towards these areas.

Jakarta public opinion believes that the recovery of Bukittinggi shows that the rebels' nest has been smashed, and the government army has basically controlled the situation in West Sumatra and the entire Sumatra. This is a major victory for Indonesia in its struggle against US interference and domestic rebellion.

Observers here believe that the Sjafruddin-Hussein rebel group can only carry out harassment activities in some scattered locations in the forest in the future, but with the direct help of the United States, the possibility of the rebel group struggling desperately before its demise cannot be ignored.

The "Indonesian Torch" newspaper said that the recovery of Bukittinggi does not mean that the activities of infringing on Indonesian sovereignty have stopped. The real enemy facing the Indonesian people now is the person pulling the strings behind the rebel group. The newspaper called for strengthening national unity and implementing total mobilization to deal with the imminent foreign aggression.

    印度尼西亚军事当局举行会议
    准备加紧消灭东部地区叛军
    美国想把北苏拉威西变成侵略基地和叛乱中心
    新华社雅加达6日电　印度尼西亚军事当局5日公布的消息表明，印度尼西亚政府军队将在东印度尼西亚地区采取进一步的军事行动。
    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安2日和3日在东爪哇第五军区的司令部里同东印度尼西亚地区的一些负责人举行了重要会议。陆军新闻处说，这次会议讨论了在东印度尼西亚地区采取进一步行动和这个地区的联络工作问题。出席会议的有南苏拉威西和东南苏拉威西防区司令马塔拉塔中校，哈桑努丁步兵团团长优素福中校，在北苏拉威西和中苏拉威西负责肃清叛乱分子的作战司令鲁克明托中校，靠近苏拉威西的第六军区（加里曼丹）司令库索·乌托莫中校，以及第五军区（东爪哇）司令沙比尼上校。
    据报道，第五军区和第六军区的部队正在共同采取攻势来肃清中苏拉威西的叛乱分子。第五军区的武装部队长期以来一直在南苏拉威西和东南苏拉威西地区对当地的“伊斯兰教军”进行扫荡。
    军事当局说，乌托莫和马塔拉塔已经在5日返回各自的辖区去执行这次会议的决定。
    据认为这次会议的决定非常重要，因为美国正在加强它对北苏拉威西的苏穆阿尔—宋巴叛乱集团的援助，甚至亲自进行侵略活动。美国和它的走狗蒋介石集团的飞机曾经不止一次地轰炸东印度尼西亚地区；帝国主义者的潜水艇和军舰也经常在那里活动。在北苏拉威西，蒋介石集团的军事人员和美国武器正在不断增加，尤其值得注意的是，美国和叛乱集团还阴谋渗入苏拉威西东面的北马鲁古地区。
    所有这些事实表明，当中苏门答腊的叛乱分子快要完蛋的时候，美国正千方百计想把北苏拉威西变成为对印度尼西亚进行侵略的坚固基地和叛乱分子活动的新中心。
    这个重要会议的决定表明，印度尼西亚政府军在肃清苏门答腊的叛乱分子残余的同时，将更加注意东印度尼西亚地区的局势，并且将采取进一步的措施来消灭受到美国支持的北苏拉威西叛乱分子。
    新华社雅加达6日电　据雅加达报纸今天报道，印度尼西亚政府军在4日收复的武吉丁宜市内的秩序正在迅速恢复中。
    据报道，当政府军刚刚开进武吉丁宜的时候，市内一片死寂。但是不久以后，居民就出来欢迎政府军。目前市内的商店已经开始营业，市内交通也已经迅速恢复。
    据报道，政府军进入武吉丁宜时没有遭到叛军的抵抗。目前政府军正在继续对武吉丁宜周围的叛军进行扫荡。
    目前，叛军残余力量主要集中在武吉丁宜东南方三十五公里的巴株山卡、辛卡腊克湖周围以及武吉丁宜东方的巴雅公务。政府军正在向上述地区挺进。
    雅加达舆论认为，政府军收复武吉丁宜这件事表明，叛乱分子的巢穴已经被粉碎，政府军已经基本上控制住西苏门答腊和整个苏门答腊的局势。这是印度尼西亚在反对美国干涉和国内叛乱活动的斗争中所取得的重大胜利。
    此间观察家认为，沙弗鲁丁—侯赛尼叛乱集团今后只能在森林中一些分散的地点进行骚扰活动，但是在美国的直接帮助下，叛乱集团在灭亡前进行拼死挣扎的可能也是不容忽视的。
    “印度尼西亚火炬报”说，武吉丁宜的收复并不表明侵犯印度尼西亚主权的活动已经停止。目前在印度尼西亚人民面前的真正的敌人是叛乱集团后面的牵线人。这家报纸呼吁加强民族团结和实行总动员以对付迫在眉睫的外国侵略。
