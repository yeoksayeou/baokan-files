　　The Japanese Communist Party Central Committee Calls on All Party Members
　　Unite with Progressive Forces to Strive for Victory in the General Election
	Overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi Government and Abolish the Political System Subservient to the United States
	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party today published a call in the "Akahata" newspaper, calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to concentrate their efforts and actively struggle to win the victory of the democratic forces in Japan in the general election.
	The call pointed out that in the election campaign for the Japanese Diet, the concern and expectations of the Japanese people for the Japanese Communist Party are deepening day by day, and a new wave of support for the Japanese Communist Party has been set off. The call pointed out that because the Nobusuke Kishi government, disregarding the wishes of the Japanese people, succumbed to the United States and adopted a policy of hostility towards China, it not only destroyed the fourth Japan-China trade agreement, but also brought Japan-China trade to a complete standstill, bringing serious losses to the Japanese economy and the people's lives.
	The call pointed out that the suffering of the Japanese people is obviously the result of Japanese monopoly capital and the Liberal Democratic Party selling out Japan's independence, unilaterally concluding the "San Francisco Peace Treaty," and adopting a policy subordinate to the United States. Therefore, Japan must adopt a new political direction. There is no other way than to overthrow the Nobusuke Kishi government, abolish the political system subservient to the United States, and thoroughly launch a struggle for peace and independence.
	The call said that in the general election, it is also necessary to thoroughly expose the Nobusuke Kishi cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's revival of militarism and anti-democratic policies. In this regard, the call once again exposed Nobusuke Kishi's attempt to implement the "small electoral district" system and revise the constitution after the general election, and to intensify the suppression of progressive forces during the general election.
	In this regard, the call emphasized that the more than six million organized workers in Japan, the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and all other Japanese progressive forces must form a political united force. The call pointed out that if these forces can be united to establish a national democratic united front, it will play a major role in changing the balance between the forces of national betrayal and reaction and the forces of the people, and will also help to establish a democratic government on the basis of the national democratic united front.

　　日共中央号召全体党员
　　联合进步力量争取大选胜利
    打倒岸信介政府废除屈从美国的政治体制
    据新华社13日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央常任干部会今天在“赤旗报”上发表号召书，号召日本共产党的全体党员集中力量，为争取使日本民主力量在大选中获得胜利积极进行斗争。
    号召书指出，在日本国会选举的竞选运动中，日本全国人民对日本共产党的关怀和期待日益深切，并且掀起了支持日本共产党的新的浪潮。号召书指出，由于岸信介政府不顾日本人民的意愿，屈从美国采取敌视中国的政策，不仅破坏了第四次日中贸易协定，还使日中贸易陷入全面停顿，为日本经济和人民生活带来了严重的损失。
    号召书指出，日本人民的痛苦显然是日本垄断资本与自由民主党出卖日本的独立，片面缔结“旧金山和约”，采取从属于美国的政策的结果。因此，日本必须采取新的政治方向。除了打倒岸信介政府，废除屈从美国的政治体制，彻底展开争取和平与独立的斗争以外是没有其他途径的。
    号召书说，在大选中还要彻底揭露岸信介内阁与自由民主党的复活军国主义和反民主的政策。在这方面，号召书再次揭露了岸信介企图在大选后实行“小选举区”制度和修改宪法，并且在大选期间加紧镇压进步力量的阴谋。
    在这方面，号召书强调必须使日本的六百多万组织起来的工人、日本共产党和社会党等一切日本进步力量结成政治上的联合力量。号召书指出，如果能够联合这些力量建立民族民主统一战线，就将在改变卖国反动力量与人民力量的对比方面发生重大作用，同时有助于在民族民主统一战线的基础上建立民主政府。
