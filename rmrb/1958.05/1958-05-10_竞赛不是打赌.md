In the Great Leap Forward, competition has become the best form of promotion. Through evaluation and inspection during the competition, we can encourage each other to work harder, learn from each other's experiences, and enable the backward to catch up with the advanced, and the advanced to become even more advanced. Walking around the countryside during the Great Leap Forward, one can see socialist production competitions everywhere, from counties and townships to communes and teams, which have set off an unprecedented upsurge in production. In Hu's Village in Laishui County, Hebei Province, an inter-commune red flag competition was launched, and the whole village took on a new look. It ranked among the top in the shock campaigns of accumulating fertilizer and planting early-maturing crops, won the top prize, and leapt from a backward village to an advanced village. In Fūwèi Village, the organization and discipline of the commune members has been greatly strengthened through the red flag competition between teams and groups and among individuals. The assembly actions are as fast and neat as soldiers. The whole village has more than 400 households and 1,000 to 2,000 commune members, and people can arrive in about 20 minutes after the assembly bell rings.

However, even the most brilliant sun has its sunspots, and even the purest jade has its flaws. Some small problems also appeared in the competition in this county. In the competition between communes, some mutually stipulated rewards and penalties for victory and defeat. For example, when Yongle Agricultural Cooperative and Fuwei Agricultural Cooperative were competing in fertilizer accumulation, they stipulated that if either side lost three times in a row, the director or secretary of the losing side would pull a horse, wear a flower, and send a fat pig (the fattest one selected from the whole village) to the winning side. When Zhang Cuitai and Xinzhuangtou Agricultural Cooperative were competing in wheat management, they stipulated that whoever lost would give the other side a good donkey.

In the competition, it is permissible for backward units to send a red flag, a congratulatory message, or a congratulatory letter to express their learning and respect for advanced units. However, it is inappropriate and prone to malpractices to use real objects as stakes and bets for winning and losing, as in the case of the above-mentioned cooperatives. It is said that Yongle Agricultural Cooperative lost to Fuwei Agricultural Cooperative twice in a row, and the branch secretary was so anxious that he shed tears (later, the township party committee helped the cooperative catch up in time, and Fuwei Agricultural Cooperative lost to the cooperative for the third time, which turned the crisis into safety). In order not to lose the big donkey, Zhang Cuitai and Xinzhuangtou nitpicked at each other during the inspection and evaluation process, and in the end they did not quarrel out a result, so they had a second competition. Obviously, this is the side effect produced by the above-mentioned practices, which shifts people's attention in the competition from promoting each other's enthusiasm and learning from each other's experiences to the winning and losing of things, and loses the true meaning and fundamental purpose of the competition.

Through these simple examples, we have come to understand this principle: the purpose of socialist competition is to advance together in socialist construction. It should include both mutual comparison and mutual learning and mutual assistance. In this way, if you are advanced, I will learn from your advanced experiences and develop them, and then catch up with you; in this way, you can learn from me again and catch up with me again. When you are advanced, you should not only drive us forward, but also help me catch up, and when I catch up with you, I should also take the initiative to help you. Only in this way can it truly play a promoting role, while gambling-style competition narrows the goal to a pig or a donkey in front of you, and the result is that you pick on my faults and I undermine you, which instead becomes a retarding effect. From this, it can also be seen that the essence of this kind of win-or-lose competition is not socialist.

    竞赛不是打赌
    任农
    在大跃进中，竞赛成了促进的一种最好形式。通过竞赛过程中的评比、检查，可以互相促干劲，可以彼此学经验，使落后的赶上先进、先进的更加先进。在跃进中的农村走一走，就可看到从县、乡到社、队，处处都有社会主义的生产竞赛，这就掀起史无前例的生产热潮。河北省涞水县的胡家乡，开展了社际红旗竞赛，全乡面貌焕然一新，在积肥、种植早熟作物等突击运动中，都名列前茅，考了状元，由落后乡一跃为先进乡。这个乡有个富位村，由于开展了队与队、组与组、人与人的夺红旗竞赛运动，社员的组织纪律性大大增强，集合动作像战士一样迅速整齐，全村有四百余户，一、二千名社员，敲集合钟后二十分左右人便能到齐。
    但是，万丈光芒的太阳难免有点黑点，洁白的玉器也难免有些瑕疵，这个县竞赛当中也出现了一些小毛病。在社与社竞赛时，有的互相规定了胜负罚约。如永乐农业社与富位农业社在积肥竞赛时，规定谁要连输三次，由负方社主任或支书为胜方拉马戴花送口肥猪（在全村中选最肥的）；张翠台和辛庄头农业社在小麦管理方面开展竞赛时规定谁要输了，要送给对方一头好毛驴。
    在竞赛当中，落后单位为了表示对先进单位的学习和尊敬，送一面红旗，献一张贺词，写一封贺信，这是可以的。但是像上述几个社，拿实物打输赢、作赌注，就不恰当，易生流弊。据说，永乐农业社连着败给了富位农业社两次，急得支部书记都流了泪（后来乡党委及时帮助该社赶了上去，第三次富位农业社输给了该社，才化险为夷）；张翠台和辛庄头为了不输大毛驴，在检查评比过程中互相吹毛求疵，最后也没争吵出个结果来，又来了个二次竞赛。显然这是上述作法所产生的副作用，把人们在竞赛中的注意由互相促干劲、彼此学经验，转移向输赢东西方面，失掉了竞赛的真正意义和根本目的。
    通过这些简单的事例，使我们明白了这样一个道理，社会主义竞赛的目的是为了在社会主义建设上共同前进，应是既有互相比较，又要互相学习，互相帮助，这样，你先进我就学你的先进，并加以发展，再赶过你；这样你又可以学我，再赶过我，你先进时除了带动以外还要帮助我赶上来，而当我赶过你时也要主动去帮助你。这样才能真正起促进的作用，而打赌式的竞赛，把目的缩小为眼前的一只猪或一头驴，结果便是你挑我的毛病，我挖你的墙脚，反而成了促退的作用。从这个也可以看出，这种赌输赢式的竞赛的实质，就不是社会主义的了。
