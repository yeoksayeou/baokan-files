Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd - The returned overseas Chinese in Beijing held a Socialist Great Leap Forward meeting at the Beijing Gymnasium today. Over seven thousand people, including returned overseas Chinese, their families, and returned overseas Chinese students, participated in the meeting.

    The meeting unanimously approved the Socialist Great Leap Forward Pact. In the pact, the returned overseas Chinese expressed their determination to transform themselves alongside the people of the whole country, to be both red and expert, to resolutely follow the socialist road, and to respond with practical actions to the Party's call to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. They pledged to be promoters in politics and innovators in technology, striving to be advanced producers and advanced workers, and to make greater contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

    Before the pact was passed, representatives of returned overseas Chinese workers, intellectuals, and students eagerly put forward their respective Great Leap Forward plans, and also issued challenges and accepted counter-challenges to each other.

    Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice Mayor of Beijing, spoke at the meeting. He listed many moving deeds of the returned overseas Chinese in the Great Leap Forward. He hoped that in formulating and completing the Great Leap Forward plans, they would grasp the two key points of having full revolutionary vigor and a realistic spirit, combine them with the situation of their own units and themselves, make good plans, and put forward effective measures for completing the plans.

    Zhuang Xiquan, Deputy Director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and Lian Guan, Vice President of the Beijing Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, also spoke at the meeting.

    大会一致通过了社会主义跃进公约。归国华侨们在公约中表示，决心和全国人民一道，自我改造，又红又专，坚决走社会主义道路，以实际行动响应党提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的号召。在政治上当促进派，在技术上当革新派，争取做个先进生产者和先进工作者，为祖国的社会主义建设事业作出更大的贡献。
    在公约通过以前，归国华侨职工、知识分子、学生代表等争先提出各自的跃进规划，并且互相提出挑战和应战。
    中共北京市委书记处书记、北京市副市长张友渔在大会上讲了话。他列举了归国华侨在大跃进中的许多动人事迹。他希望他们在制订跃进规划和完成规划时，抓住鼓足革命干劲，又有求实精神两点，结合本单位和自己的情况，把规划订好，并提出完成规划的有效措施。
