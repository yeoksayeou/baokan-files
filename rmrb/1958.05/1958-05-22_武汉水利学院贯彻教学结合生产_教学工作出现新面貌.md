The Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy Implements Teaching Combined with Production; Teaching Work Shows a New Look

(Our newspaper reports) The Wuhan Institute of Water Conservancy, in implementing the policy of combining teaching with production, has seen a new look in teaching and scientific research.

In the past few months, this institute has sent four groups of teachers to support water conservancy construction in the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei Province and the Dongxihu reclamation project in Wuhan, solving many practical problems. In January, more than two hundred students went to various parts of Jiangxi and Hubei provinces to participate in the design and construction of farmland water conservancy projects, not only providing technical support but also integrating theory with practice and cultivating the feelings of workers and peasants.

This year, more than two hundred graduating students of the Water Conservancy Improvement Department of this institute broke with convention in their graduation designs, no longer confining themselves to classroom work, but going to construction sites to work with real tools. They are working in water conservancy departments in Hubei, Henan, Hebei, Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, and other provinces, as well as in scientific research and design departments in Beijing, Wuhan, and other places, so that the results of their graduation designs can be directly applied to water conservancy construction. Many important technical projects in the Wuhu reclamation project in Hubei and eight medium-sized water conservancy projects undertaken by Hunan Province will be undertaken by them.

In terms of scientific research, the institute has made new progress. Recently, in order to cooperate with the great leap forward in water conservancy construction, the Farmland Water Conservancy Research Office and the Large Hydraulic Hub Research Office were established. The Farmland Water Conservancy Research Office focuses on summarizing the experience of rural water conservancy construction in Xiangyang Special District of Hubei Province last winter and this spring, and has summarized fourteen topics for research. A group of teachers has begun to carry out scientific research work. The main task of the Large Hydraulic Hub Research Office is to solve complex technical problems in the construction of large hydraulic hubs such as the Three Gorges and Danjiangkou, and it has obtained the cooperation of the Yangtze River Basin Planning Department. The Hydraulics Teaching and Research Group, which has strong strength, is conducting special studies on the Jingjiang mobile bed model test, the evolution of the Yellow River downstream riverbed directly related to the Sanmenxia project, and the sediment carrying capacity of the Yellow River flow. The institute will also be responsible for the complete survey and design of ten hydropower stations in Tongshan and Chongyang counties. (Li Yu)

    武汉水利学院贯彻教学结合生产
    教学工作出现新面貌
    本报讯　武汉水利学院在贯彻教学与生产相结合的方针中，教学和科学研究工作出现了新的面貌。
    几个月来，这个学院先后派出四批教师支援了湖北襄阳专区水利建设和武汉市东西湖围垦工程，解决了不少实际问题。1月间，有二百多学生分别到江西、湖北两省各地参加农田水利建设的设计、施工等工作，不仅从技术上支援了他们，更使理论结合了实际，培养了工人农民思想感情。
    这个学院水利改良系的应届毕业生二百多人，今年打破常规做毕业设计，不是在课堂里闭门造车，而是到工地动真刀真枪了。他们分别在湖北、河南、河北、湖南、安徽、江西等省水利部门及北京、武汉等地的科学研究、设计部门进行工作，使毕业设计的成果直接用于水利建设。湖北武湖围垦工程、湖南省办的八个中型水利工程中的许多重要技术项目，都将由他们担负。
    在科学研究方面，该院有了新的开展。最近为了配合水利建设大跃进，成立了农田水利研究室和大型水工枢纽研究室。农田水利研究室着重总结去冬今春湖北襄阳专区农村水利建设的经验，归纳为十四个题目进行研究，有一批教师已开始进行科学研究工作。大型水工枢纽研究室则以解决三峡、丹江口等大型水工枢纽建设中的复杂技术问题为主要任务，已取得长江流域规划部门的配合协作。拥有雄厚力量的水力学教研组正在进行着荆江动床模型试验、直接与三门峡工程有关的黄河下游河床演变、黄河水流挟砂能力等专题研究。这个学院还将负责通山、崇阳两县的十个水电站的全部勘测设计工作。（李育）
