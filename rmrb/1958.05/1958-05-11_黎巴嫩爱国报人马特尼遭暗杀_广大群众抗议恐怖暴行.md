    Lebanese Patriotic Journalist Matni Assassinated
    Broad Masses Protest Terrorist Atrocity
    (Comprehensive report from this newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: Nassib Matni, the president and editor-in-chief of the Lebanese "Telegraph," was assassinated by thugs on the morning of the 8th.
    Matni was a well-known and one of the most courageous nationalist journalists in Lebanon. He demanded the implementation of a national independence policy and opposed the government using the "Eisenhower Doctrine" as the basis of its policy. Therefore, he was once arrested by the Lebanese government in July of last year and was twice subjected to assassination attempts by members of the fascist National Socialist Party, supported by British and American imperialists.
    The Lebanese Parliament discussed the assassination of Matni on the 8th. Opposition members of parliament severely criticized the government, demanding that the government resign or reveal the true identity of the murderers.
    In a statement, opposition parties and nationalist leaders pointed out that the authorities should be held responsible for the assassination of Matni. They pointed out that this event proves that Lebanon is in a period of terror using assassination as a means to abolish the various freedoms stipulated by law.
    According to Damascus Radio, nearly 20,000 residents of Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, participated in the funeral of the assassinated nationalist fighter Matni on the 9th, and traffic in the city was interrupted for four hours.
    According to news from Damascus, journalists and the broad masses in the Lebanese cities of Tripoli, Tyre, Sidon, Baalbek, Hermel, Zgharta, Nabatieh, and other cities held strikes and demonstrations to protest the assassination of Matni. In Tripoli and Hermel, police suppressing the demonstrations clashed with the masses.
    The Lebanese Press Association has decided to strike for three days starting on the 10th to protest the assassination of Matni.

    黎巴嫩爱国报人马特尼遭暗杀
　　广大群众抗议恐怖暴行
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：黎巴嫩“电讯报”社长兼主编纳西卜·马特尼8日清晨被暴徒暗杀。
    马特尼是黎巴嫩著名的一位最勇敢的民族主义新闻工作者。他要求执行民族独立政策，反对政府以“艾森豪威尔主义”作为它的政策基础。因此，他在去年7月曾一度被黎巴嫩政府逮捕，并曾两次遭到英美帝国主义者所支持的法西斯国家社会党分子的暗算。
    黎巴嫩议会8日讨论了马特尼被暗杀事件，反对党议员严厉指责政府，要求政府辞职，或者公布凶手的真面目。
    反对党和民族主义领袖们在一项声明中指出，有关当局要对谋杀马特尼的事件负责。他们指出，这件事证明，黎巴嫩正处在以谋刺为手段的恐怖时期，采取这种手段是为了取消法律规定的各项自由。
    据大马士革电台广播，黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特将近二万居民在9日参加了被暗杀的民族主义战士马特尼的葬礼，全市交通中断了四小时。
    据大马士革消息，在黎巴嫩的黎波里、特尔、赛义达、巴尔贝克、赫麦尔、扎加尔塔、纳巴提亚等城市的新闻工作者和广大群众举行了罢工和示威，抗议暗杀马特尼。在的黎波里和赫麦尔，镇压示威的警察同群众发生了冲突。
    黎巴嫩报业协会已经决定从10日起罢工三天，抗议马特尼被暗杀。
