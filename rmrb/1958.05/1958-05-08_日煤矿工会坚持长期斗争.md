　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th dispatch: The Japanese Coal Miners' Union held a temporary congress in Tokyo on the 6th, at which it was decided to persist in the current struggle to demand higher wages for a longer term.

　　The prevailing opinion at this congress was that the struggle was not only for higher wages but also a class struggle against the oppression of workers by the powerful.

　　Since the beginning of March, the Japanese Coal Miners' Union has been conducting various forms of struggle, such as slowing down production and wave-like strikes, to demand a wage increase of 2,000 yen. Subsequently, from March 19th, the unions of four companies began an indefinite strike, which has continued to this day. However, because the capitalists have consistently refused to accept the workers' demand for a wage increase, this temporary congress decided to carry out a long-term struggle.

　　According to Kyodo News Agency, this struggle may develop into a strike larger in scale than the coal mine strike held in 1951, which lasted sixty-three days.

    日煤矿工会坚持长期斗争
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本煤矿工会6日在东京举行临时大会，会上决定把目前正在进行的要求提高工资的斗争更长期地坚持下去。
    在这次大会上占优势的意见认为，这次斗争不仅是为了提高工资，而且是对压迫工人的强权进行的阶级斗争。
    日本煤矿工会为了要求提高工资二千日元，从3月上旬起就在进行着放慢生产和波浪式罢工等各种形式的斗争。接着，从3月19日起，四家公司的工会开始了无限期的罢工，罢工一直坚持到今天。但是，由于资方一直拒绝接受工人的增加工资的要求，这次临时大会才决定进行长期斗争。
    据共同社说，这次斗争可能发展成为比1951年举行的历时六十三天的煤矿罢工规模更大的罢工。
