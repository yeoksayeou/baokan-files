Notes

    Diplomacy and Fish

    In the United States Congress, some people criticized the U.S. State Department for spending too much money. Dulles strongly disagreed. He testified that, you know, although the United States "does not want to manage the whole world," "whether the problem involves Icelandic fish, the Indonesian revolution, or the Burmese riots, the problem always has to be placed before us," so diplomatic spending cannot be reduced under any circumstances.

    Indeed, since the U.S. State Department has to manage so many things, spending too little is not an option. However, people have to ask: Why should Dulles manage everything from Icelandic fish to the Indonesian "revolution"? Why do other countries' internal affairs "always" have to be placed before Dulles? It is evident that the problem is not that the U.S. diplomatic spending is too high, but that the U.S. State Department's activities of interfering in other countries' internal affairs are too numerous.

    外交和鱼
    在美国国会里，有人批评美国国务院花钱太多了。杜勒斯大不以为然。他作证说，要知道，美国虽然“并不想管理全世界”，但是“不管问题是牵涉到冰岛的鱼、印度尼西亚的革命还是缅甸的骚乱，问题总是要摆在我们面前”，所以，外交经费无论如何是不能削减的。
    的确，既然美国国务院要管这么多的事，花钱太少是不行的。不过，人们要问：为什么从冰岛的鱼到印度尼西亚的“革命”都要由杜勒斯来管呢？为什么别国的内政问题“总是”要摆在杜勒斯面前呢？可见问题并不是美国外交经费太多了，而是美国国务院到处干涉他国内政的活动太多了。
