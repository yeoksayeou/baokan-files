　　A Short Record of Flower Viewing
　　Xie Dangzai
    Visiting the Silk Weaving Cooperative
    While visiting the Ximen Silk Weaving Cooperative, the director of the cooperative, Lin Binu, said: "We are all unemployed silk weaving workers. The silk weaving industry in Chengdu is gradually declining. In its heyday, there were tens of thousands of people, and before liberation, there were still nearly ten thousand. After liberation, the factory owners resolutely applied to shut down their businesses, so we became unemployed. Some returned to the countryside, and some went to other places. Now there are more than eight hundred people organized into cooperatives, with six cooperatives in total. My cooperative is the largest, with more than two hundred people. We started from scratch, borrowed more than ten thousand yuan, and still have six thousand yuan to repay. My cooperative uses piece-rate wages, with the highest earning more than forty yuan a month and the lowest earning more than twenty yuan. Apprentices used to study for five years, but now it takes at most a year or so. For example, learning to pull the shuttle only takes three months." The cooperative's factory building is made of thatched grass and bamboo walls. There is very little investment in infrastructure. Spinning, scouring, and weaving are all done by hand. The products are mostly quilt covers and monks' robes. The patterns and colors are bright, but there are still few materials suitable for ordinary people's clothing. The director of the cooperative said: We want to develop in this direction. There is a market for the products, but there are not enough raw materials. During the liberation, landlords cut down mulberry trees, and the newly planted ones have not yet grown up. The purchasing company also cannot give them more raw silk.
    I saw two poverty alleviation production groups: one is making cloth from waste hemp, some coarse and some fine. The manufacturing process is: bleaching rotten hemp ropes and sacks, tearing them into pieces, fluffing them into fibers, spinning them into thread, and weaving them into cloth. This group has fifty-three old women who were originally recipients of relief, but now they can earn sixteen or seventeen yuan a month; there are seventeen men, with strong labor and good skills, who can earn thirty or forty yuan a month. There are no factory buildings, and most of them work at home. The other is a charcoal ash manufacturing group, which collects coal ash burned in factories and households, sifting it several times, and manufactures some materials for construction. There are no problems with raw materials and sales. The lowest wage is eighteen or nineteen yuan a month, the average wage is forty-five yuan, and a few transportation workers who own their own transportation tools can earn more than eighty yuan.
    Visiting Dujiangyan
    I went to see Dujiangyan with comrades Zhang Shushi and Wu Jun. This is a huge water conservancy project led by Li Bing and his son more than 2,200 years ago. It still serves the people, ensuring that the Chengdu Plain has no worries about drought or flood on about six million mu of land. In the old government era, it only irrigated more than two million mu. After rectification after liberation, this year it can irrigate more than six million mu.
    The construction of Dujiangyan is completely in line with science. For example, the six-character formula: "Dig the river deep, make the weir shallow" means that the river should be dug deep, and the flood discharge weir should be lower, so that when there is a lot of water entering the Inner River, it will be discharged into the Outer River from the weir. "Cut corners when encountering bends" is to slow down the flow, and "draw the heart when encountering straights" is to deepen the river channel.
    Li Bing's son, Erlang, probably contributed the most. The people deified him, and the statue has three eyes. I wrote a poem:
    I heard little about Li Bing when young,
    Only now in old age do I reach Li Dui.
    He uses water as he uses horses,
    Controlling its height and speed at will.
    The Three Character Classic is passed down from ancient times,
    The Flying Sand Weir redirects the flow.
    Deep thought allows one to see far,
    Three eyes are not strange.
    A Poem Gifted to the Youth of Chongqing
    I arrived in Chongqing and stayed in the People's Auditorium. The People's Auditorium in Chongqing is larger than anything I have ever seen, and larger than I could have imagined, but its utilization rate is very low, and it costs a large amount of maintenance fees every year.
    Chongqing is a beautiful mountain city. During the day, standing on Pipa Mountain, the surrounding green mountains and verdant cliffs, red buildings and green pavilions, rivers and roads wind up and down, like countless painted screens hanging. The towering glazed tile dome of the People's Auditorium will not fail to be a great embellishment. Standing here at night to watch, the stars are as numerous as the sea, which is extremely beautiful.
    The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League asked me and Comrade Xu Teli to go to the League School to meet about 800 League cadres for speeches and photos, which was very lively. They presented us with models made by youth factories and woodcuts by young writers.
    "Chongqing League News" asked me to write a few words, so I wrote the following:
    Add vigor to diligence, politics to technology;
    The more you delve into reason, the deeper it becomes, the more you work, the greater your strength.
    Politics is the commander, technology is the vanguard;
    With both courage and resourcefulness, you will be successful in every battle.
    Do not be arrogant in success, do not be afraid of failure;
    The journey of victory is long and arduous.
    In the new international situation, the East wind prevails over the West wind;
    Overcome poverty and ignorance, and flowers will bloom everywhere.
    Passing Through the Three Gorges
    I left Chongqing for Hankou on the "Jingmen" ship. The Yangtze River below Chongqing is flanked by mountains, and the cities along the river are built on the mountains. Changshou County is named after the many long-lived people in the county; Fengdu County has the Yama Temple; Zhong County is the hometown of Qin Liangyu, and the Chongqing Museum has Qin Liangyu's embroidered robes. Wanxian City is a county with more than 100,000 people, and is famous for its leather suitcases and leather shoes, which are cheaper than in Chongqing. Passing Fengjie, you enter the Three Gorges.
    It is not easy to write poems in the old style that people like to read. I wrote a few seven-character quatrains on the boat, and I will record one of them below:
      The mountains are high and the water falls, the boat sits lightly,
      Tung flowers on both banks greet and send.
      Countless terraces have been well-cultivated in spring,
      New villages are found in the depths of the green shade.
    Although it is realistic, it is a bit literary, and farmers may not like to read it. When I arrived at the Wu Gorge, I saw a standing stone on the highest peak that looked like a person, said to be the Goddess. I wrote another poem:
      The boat passes through the Three Gorges of Wu Mountain,
      Seeing the goddess on the top of the mountain.
      A thousand miles in one day to Jiangling,
      Not seeing a single monkey.
    The words are colloquial. But you also need to have read Li Bai's poem: "I leave Baidi amidst the colorful clouds at dawn, returning to Jiangling in a thousand miles in a single day. The sound of apes on both banks cannot be stopped, the light boat has already passed ten thousand mountains," to know the origin of the last two sentences. 〔To be continued tomorrow〕

　　观花小记
　　谢党哉
    访丝织合作社
    参观西门丝织合作社，社主任林斌如说：“我们都是丝织业失业工人。成都丝织业是逐渐衰落的，全盛时期有几万人，解放前尚有近万人，解放后厂主都坚决申请停业，于是我们失业了，有的回了农村，有的到别地去了。现在组织合作社的有八百多人，有六个合作社，我社最大的有二百多人。我们是白手起家，贷了一万多元，现尚有六千元未还。我社是计件工资，多的每月四十多元，少的二十多元。学徒以前要学五年，现在最长一年多，如止拉梭三个月就会了。”该社厂房是草盖竹壁。基建投资很少。纺、练、织都是手工，产品多是被面料，僧侣衣料，花样色彩都鲜，但宜于做一般人民衣服料子尚少。社主任说：要向这方面发展。产品销路是有，但原料不够，解放时地主砍伐桑树，新栽的还未长大，收购公司又不能多给他们生丝。
    看了两个贫民生产组：一是把废麻制成布，有粗的有细的，制造过程：把烂麻绳麻袋漂白，撕碎，弹成花，纺成线，织成布，这个社有五十三个老太婆原是救济对象，现每月都可挣十六七元；有一十七个男子，劳力强技术好的，月可挣三、四十元。没有厂房，大多在家里做。一是炭灰制造组，收集工厂、家户烧过的煤灰、经过几次筛拣，制成若干供建筑用的材料。原料和销路无问题。工资最少的月可得十八、九元，平均工资四十五元，几个运输工人自有运输工具的可得八十多元。
    看都江堰
    同张曙时、吴均同志去看都江堰。这是二千二百多年前李冰父子领导的巨大水利工程，至今犹为人民服务，保障了成都坝子约六百多万亩地水旱无忧。在旧政府时代只灌溉二百余万亩，解放后加以整顿，今年可灌溉到六百多万亩。
    都江堰建筑完全合乎科学。如六字诀：“深淘滩、浅作堰”即淘河要深，排洪堰要低些，使入内江的水多时，从堰上泄入外江。“遇湾截角”，是使流势缓，又“遇直抽心”，是使河漕深。
    李冰的儿子二郎，大概是他出力最多，人民把他神化了，塑的像有三只眼睛。写诗一首：
    少闻李冰事，老始到离堆。
    使水如使马，高下疾徐随。
    三字经传古，飞沙堰势回。
    思深能见远，三眼未为奇。
    赠重庆青年的诗
    到重庆，住人民大礼堂。重庆的人民大礼堂，是没有见过的大，也想不出的大，但它的利用率很低，每年要花一笔很大的维持费。
    重庆是一个美丽的山城，日里站在琵琶山上，四面青山翠岩，红楼绿阁，河流公路回环高下，如插挂着无数扇画屏，而高耸的琉璃瓦圆顶的人民大礼堂，也不会失其为伟大点缀。夜里站在此处观望，繁星点点如海，极为美观。
    重庆市团委约我同徐特立同志去团校，会见了团的干部约八百人，讲话、照像，很热闹。赠送我们以少年工厂制的模型和青年作家的木刻等。
    “重庆团讯”要我写几句话，写如下：
    干劲加钻劲，政治加技术；
    理越钻越深，劲越干越大。
    政治是统帅，技术是尖兵；
    有勇又有谋，百战百成功。
    成功不可骄，失败不要怕；
    胜利旅途中，长远又艰巨。
    国际新形势，东风压西风；
    战胜穷与白，鲜花遍地红。
    过三峡
    乘“荆门”轮船离重庆去汉口。长江自重庆以下两崖皆山，沿江的城市都是依山建立的。长寿县是因该县多人长寿而得名；酆都县有阎王庙；忠县即秦良玉的家乡，重庆博物馆存有秦良玉穿过的绣花袍服。万县城是有十多万人口的县，产皮箱、皮鞋有名，价钱比重庆低。过奉节即进入三峡。
    用旧诗体写诗，要人家喜欢念，颇不容易。在船上写了几首七绝，记一首如下：
      山高水落坐轮轻，
      两岸桐花作送迎。
      无数梯田春作好，
      绿阴深处有新村。
    虽是写实，颇嫌有点文人气，农民不一定喜欢念。到巫峡、望见最高峰有个像人的立石，说是神女。又写了一首：
      舟过巫山三峡，
      看到山头神女。
      一日千里江陵，
      不见一只猴子。
    话是通俗了。但又须读过李白：“朝辞白帝彩云间，千里江陵一日还，两岸猿声啼不住，轻舟已过万重山。”的诗，才知道后二句的来源。　〔明日续完〕
