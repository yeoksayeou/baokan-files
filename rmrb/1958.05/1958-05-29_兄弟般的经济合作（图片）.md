Fraternal Economic Cooperation

    Assembly workers at the Lange Machine Factory in Budapest, Hungary, are assembling turbines for our country. This machine factory has a long history of ninety years. However, it was only after the liberation of Hungary in 1945, when the people took power, that the factory experienced rapid development, and by 1953, the number of workers had already exceeded four thousand. The factory supplies products to meet domestic needs, and a large portion of its products are exported abroad. Hungarian News Agency (Xinhua News Agency)
