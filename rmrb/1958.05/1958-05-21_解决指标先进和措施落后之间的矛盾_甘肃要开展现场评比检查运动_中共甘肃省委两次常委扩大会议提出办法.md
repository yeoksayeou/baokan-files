    Resolving the Contradiction Between Advanced Indicators and Backward Measures
    Gansu to Launch On-Site Appraisal and Inspection Campaign
    The Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the CPC Proposes Methods in Two Expanded Meetings of the Standing Committee
    (Our report) The Gansu Provincial Party Committee of the CPC recently held two expanded meetings of the Standing Committee in Zhuanglang and Wuwei respectively, putting forward the fighting slogan of "Compare Hard Work, Compare Measures, Compare Progress, Compare Results," and decided to launch a mass appraisal movement centered on the "Four Comparisons" throughout the province, demanding that both rectification and production be carried out with full force.
    The meeting first examined and studied ideological issues and industrial and agricultural production issues. The meeting held that since last winter and this spring, a comprehensive leap forward has occurred in all work in the province, and the thinking of the working people has been unprecedentedly liberated. This leap forward and liberation is still developing in a galloping momentum. As of April 17, the province had completed 10.22 million mu of water conservancy projects, 23,000+ square kilometers of water and soil conservation projects, and 23.5 million+ mu of afforestation. Four counties and cities and more than 5,000 units have emerged that have done exceptionally well in sanitation work. More than 2,140 newly established local industries have been put into production. More than 2 million of the 3.5 million+ illiterate people have entered literacy schools. In particular, the inventions and technological innovations that have emerged due to the high morale and ideological liberation of the broad masses are colorful and dazzling. Such great achievements and active phenomena were unimaginable in the past, but today they have become vivid reality. This is also a brilliant victory for Chairman Mao's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism." However, it should be seen that the development of work is not balanced. Many counties are leaping forward in some aspects and lagging behind in others. The phenomenon of advanced indicators but backward measures, or having measures but poor implementation methods, or lacking methods is even more common. Therefore, it is very necessary to conduct a general appraisal to use the advanced to spur the backward, drive the intermediate, overcome the contradiction between advanced indicators and backward measures, and promote the work of the whole province. The Zhuanglang meeting clearly pointed out that the contradiction of things is phased, and the main contradiction in rural work at present is the contradiction between advanced indicators and backward measures. The main contradiction in the previous stage was the contradiction between backward indicators and advanced indicators. After the struggle of the broad masses, conservative thinking was hit, advanced indicators were determined, and the main contradiction was transformed into the contradiction between advanced indicators and backward measures. The struggle between conservatism and progress is also concentrated on this issue. This contradiction has not actually been resolved in many parts of our province. Advanced indicators must have advanced measures, which has been achieved in some places, but measures have not kept up in many places. In some places, planned indicators remain at the level of communes and teams, and have not yet achieved measures to the ground and responsibility to the people. Some measures are not yet advanced, and individual places have no measures at all, which cannot guarantee the realization of leap forward indicators. Therefore, the meeting required that Party committees at all levels must firmly grasp this main contradiction. To solve this contradiction, it is necessary to achieve indicators plus measures, measures plus effort, effort plus methods. In order to prevent unexpected disasters, reserve measures are also needed. Whoever ignores this issue will not grasp the essence of things, and the production increase plan will fall through.
    The meeting held that the task before us is very arduous. The central issue in completing this task is to grasp ideological work. Politics is the commander and the soul. This meeting prominently studied ideological issues. According to the analysis of the meeting, the focus of the current ideological struggle is on the issue of the socialist construction line: Is it to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, go all out, and aim high, or is it to achieve less, slower, worse, and more costly results, be lukewarm, and willingly lag behind? The meeting pointed out that greater, faster, better, and more economical results are the essence and mainstream of things, like a tree trunk. As long as the tree trunk is grasped, the direction will be correct, and fundamental mistakes will not be made. Mistakes in details will not affect the overall situation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct serious debates. At present, the debate should focus on current production, combined with the "Double Anti" campaign, and review the "Four Comparisons". In the near future, two or three days should be set aside for the masses to rest and recuperate. During the rest and recuperation period, a major debate on comparing hard work, comparing measures, comparing progress, and comparing results should be conducted. In the debate, the masses should be encouraged to speak their minds and write big-character posters. During the mass debate, a major debate on the "Double Anti" campaign should also be conducted among county and district cadres, focusing on criticizing the construction line of "less, slower, worse, and more costly results." Through the major debate, we should also crack down on the destructive activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and other anti-socialist elements. This is the key to current work and must be firmly grasped.
    In order to rapidly push the production leap forward to a new level, the Wuwei meeting required that all localities and all aspects of the province, from counties to communes and teams, from factories and mines to workshops and work sections, must universally launch a mass mutual inspection and on-site appraisal movement in the near future. The movement requires that both rectification and production be carried out with full force. The specific content is to compare hard work, compare measures, compare progress, and compare results. The method is mutual inspection, on-site appraisal, promotion of advanced experiences, and driving overall progress. The object is mainly industrial and agricultural production, but also includes other aspects of work. The purpose is to better implement the line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results." In the appraisal, leaders should pay special attention to enlightening everyone to speak freely in order to comprehensively and accurately measure achievements and shortcomings.
    The two meetings also studied the improvement of agricultural tools, the improvement of agricultural machinery manufacturing, the realization of biogasification, and the launching of major debates in rural areas to encourage the publication of big-character posters. First of all, the improvement of agricultural tools throughout the province must resolutely rely on the masses and fully follow the mass line. Technical talents should be found among the masses, and inventions and creations of the masses should be actively supported and encouraged. The current focus of agricultural tool reform is on transportation tools, tillage tools, basic construction tools, irrigation and drainage tools, and pesticide machinery. Counties should establish a number of agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories and stations in a planned manner to form a repair network to solve the problem of agricultural tool repair for the masses. According to the experience of using biogas in other regions, and the pilot experience in Pingliang and Tianshui in our province, using biogas for lighting, cooking, and power can not only save a lot of fuel, but also greatly improve fertilizer efficiency. At the same time, it can also promote sanitation campaigns, improve people's cultural level, and change the backward appearance of rural areas. Efforts should be made to basically achieve biogasification in most rural and urban areas of the province before the end of September this year.

    解决指标先进和措施落后之间的矛盾
    甘肃要开展现场评比检查运动
    中共甘肃省委两次常委扩大会议提出办法
    本报讯　中共甘肃省委最近先后在庄浪、武威举行了两次常委（扩大）会议，提出“比苦干、比措施、比进度、比实效”的战斗口号，决定在全省范围内开展以四比为中心的群众性评比运动，要求把整风、生产两套锣鼓都打好。
    这次会议首先检查、研究了思想问题和工农业生产问题。会议认为：去冬今春，全省各项工作出现了全面大跃进，劳动人民的思想得到了空前的解放，这个跃进和解放目前还以万马奔腾的形势，继续向前发展着。截至4月17日全省完成水利工程一千零二十二万亩，完成水土保持工程两万三千余平方公里，植树造林二千三百五十余万亩，出现卫生工作作得特别好的四个县市和五千多个单位。新办的地方工业投入生产的二千一百四十余个。三百五十余万文盲，已有二百多万进了扫盲学校。特别是由于广大群众的情绪高涨，思想解放而出现的发明创造、技术革新，更是万紫千红，灿烂夺目。这样伟大的成绩和活跃的现象，过去想像也不敢想像，但今天已经变成生动的现实，这也是毛主席鼓足干劲、力争上游，多快好省建设社会主义总路线的辉煌胜利。但是应当看到工作发展不是平衡的，有不少县在某些方面跃进，在某些方面落后，至于指标先进，措施落后，有措施而贯彻措施的方法不好，或缺乏方法的现象就更普遍了，因此普遍进行一次评比，用先进鞭策落后，带动中间，克服先进指标和落后措施之间的矛盾，推动全省工作，就十分必要。庄浪会议明确指出：事物的矛盾是有阶段性的，当前农村工作的主要矛盾是先进指标和落后措施的矛盾。前一阶段的主要矛盾则是落后指标和先进指标的矛盾。经过广大群众的斗争，保守思想受到打击，先进指标确定下来了，主要矛盾便转化为先进指标和落后措施的矛盾了。保守和先进的斗争也集中在这个问题上。这个矛盾在我省许多地方实际上没有解决，先进的指标必须有先进的措施，这在一部分地方已经作到，而许多地方措施却赶不上。有些地方计划指标停留在社队，还没有做到措施到地，责任到人，有些措施还不算先进，个别地方还没有措施，这就不能保证实现跃进指标。因此会议要求各级党委必须紧紧抓住这个主要矛盾，解决这个矛盾，必须做到指标加措施，措施加干劲，干劲加方法。为了防止意外灾害，还需预备措施。谁要忽视这个问题，谁就抓不住事物的本质，增产计划就会落空。
    会议认为，摆在我们面前的任务是十分艰巨的，完成这一任务的中心问题，是抓思想工作。政治是统帅，是灵魂，这次会议突出地研究了思想问题。根据会议分析，当前思想斗争的焦点在社会主义建设的路线问题上，是多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游呢？还是少慢差费、冷冷清清甘心落后呢？会议指出，多快好省是事物的本质和主流，犹如树干，只要把树干抓住，方向就对头了，就不会在根本上犯错误，枝节上犯了错误也不会影响大局。因此要认真进行辩论，在目前应以当前生产为中心，结合双反，检查四比。在最近抽出两三天时间，让群众进行休整，利用休整时间，进行一次比苦干、比措施、比进度、比实效的大辩论。辩论中要提倡群众说心里话，写大字报。在群众大辩论时，也应该在县区干部中进行一次双反大辩论，着重批判少、慢、差、费的建设路线。通过大辩论也要打击地、富、反、坏和其他反社会主义分子破坏活动。这是当前工作的纲，必须紧紧抓住。
    为了迅速把生产跃进推向一个新的水平，武威会议要求全省各地、各方面从县到社、队，从厂矿到车间、工段，都必须于最近普遍开展一次群众性的互相检查、现场评比运动。运动要求是整风、生产两套锣鼓都打好，具体内容是比苦干、比措施、比进度、比实效。方法是相互检查、现场评比、推广先进、带动全面。对象主要是工农业生产，同时包括其他方面的工作，目的是为了更好地贯彻执行“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省”的路线。在评比中领导要特别注意启发大家畅所欲言，以求全面准确地衡量成绩缺点。
    这两次会议还研究了改良农具改进农业机械制造、实现沼气化和在农村开展大辩论提倡出大字报等问题，首先全省的农具改良必须坚决依靠群众，充分走群众路线，技术人材要在群众中去找，对群众的发明创造要积极支持鼓励。农具改革当前着重抓运输工具、耕作工具、基本建设工具、排灌工具和农药机械等。各县应有计划地建立起一些农具制造、修配厂、站，形成修配网，以解决群众农具修配问题。根据其他地区利用沼气的经验，和本省平凉、天水等地的试办经验，用沼气照明煮饭、作动力，既能大量节约燃料，又可以大大提高肥效，同时还可以促进卫生运动，提高人民文化水平，改变农村落后面貌，要争取今年9月底以前，全省大部分农村和城市基本实现沼气化。
