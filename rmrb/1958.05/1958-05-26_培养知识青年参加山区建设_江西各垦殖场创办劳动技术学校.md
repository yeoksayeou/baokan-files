Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 22nd: The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee has decided to establish a labor technology school in each of the more than one hundred mountain reclamation farms established by cadres sent to lower levels throughout the province, in order to absorb and cultivate educated youth to participate in mountain area construction.

Prior to this, various reclamation farms in Jiangxi Province had continuously received letters from educated youth from all over the province and many other provinces, earnestly requesting to be received to the mountains to participate in mountain area construction. The establishment of labor technology schools can satisfy their wishes. Any young people with a certain level of education can enroll as formal students after passing an examination. The courses of study mainly include various basic knowledge and technologies of forestry, agriculture, and animal husbandry production, while closely integrating theory with practice, and spending sufficient time on labor production.

    培养知识青年参加山区建设
    江西各垦殖场创办劳动技术学校
    据新华社南昌22日电　江西省人民委员会决定在全省下放干部建立的一百多个山区垦殖场内，各创办一所劳动技术学校，以吸收和培养知识青年参加山区建设。
    在此以前，江西省各个垦殖场曾不断接到全省各地和许多外省知识青年的来信，恳切要求接收他们上山参加山区建设。劳动技术学校的创办，就可以满足他们的这种愿望。这种学校，只要具有一定文化程度的青年，经考试合格，便可以入学成为正式学员。学习的课程主要是林、农、牧业生产的各种基本知识和技术，同时密切结合实践，以充分时间进行劳动生产。
