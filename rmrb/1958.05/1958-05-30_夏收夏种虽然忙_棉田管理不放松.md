Although it is the busy season for summer harvesting and planting, it is also a crucial time for cotton field management, and there must be absolutely no relaxation. This year's summer crops have had a bumper harvest, and the area for summer planting has increased significantly. The tasks of summer harvesting and planting are substantial, the time is short, the requirements are high, and labor and animal power are very strained. How to strengthen cotton field management while ensuring the successful completion of summer harvesting and planting is a very important issue. Many regions have already adopted effective measures and reasonable arrangements to solve this problem. In mid-May, Xinxiang Prefecture in Henan Province specifically held a meeting to make unified arrangements for simultaneously carrying out summer harvesting and planting, preventing and controlling cotton aphids, and managing cotton fields. Xinxiang County ensures that during the summer harvesting and planting period, in addition to dedicating most of its labor to rushing the harvest and planting, it still has a portion of its labor force responsible for the regular management of cotton fields. This approach of unified arrangement is worth learning from in various regions.

In cotton-grain intercropping areas, it is even more important to seize the time for cotton field management during the summer harvesting and planting season. This is because most of the cotton in these areas is intercropped between the rows of summer crops, and the cotton seedlings have long been shaded by the previous crops, resulting in poor growth and development. After rushing to harvest the summer crops, it is urgently necessary to strengthen the cotton field with soil cultivation, weeding, thinning, fixing seedlings, applying fertilizer, and controlling pests. Otherwise, it will be difficult for the cotton seedlings to develop rapidly. In the South, there will be more rain and vigorous weed growth in the coming period. If cotton field management is relaxed for a few days, the phenomenon of abandoned seedlings will occur. As early as before the summer harvest, Hubei Province established a specialized leadership organization to strengthen the preparations for summer harvesting and planting and the cotton field's "Four Quicks" ("Four Quicks" refers to quickly harvesting wheat in cotton-wheat intercropping fields, quickly eliminating stubble and weeding, quickly thinning and fixing seedlings, and quickly applying fertilizer to promote seedling growth). This shows that unified planning and full preparation can ensure the successful completion of all aspects of summer production. (Attached photo)

### 夏收夏种虽然忙　棉田管理不放松

    夏收夏种虽然忙　棉田管理不放松
    在夏收夏种的大忙季节里，也是棉花田间管理紧要关头，丝毫不能放松。今年夏熟作物大丰收，夏种作物面积增加很多，夏收夏种的任务大，时间短，要求高，劳畜力十分紧张。如何在保证作好夏收夏种的同时，加强棉花的田间管理工作，是一个很重要的问题。许多地区为了解决这一问题，已经采取了有效的措施和合理的安排。河南省新乡专区5月中旬特地对同时作好夏收夏种、防治棉蚜、棉田管理工作，召开了一次会议，进行了统筹的安排。新乡县保证在夏收夏种期间，除以大部分劳力投入抢收抢种外，仍有一部分劳动力负责棉田的经常管理。这种统筹安排的作法，值得各地学习。
    棉粮两熟栽培的棉区，夏收夏种时期，更要抓紧棉田的管理。因为这种地区的大部棉花是套种在夏收作物行间的，棉苗长期受到前作物的荫蔽，生长发育较差。在抢收夏熟作物以后，迫切需要加强棉田的中耕、除草、间苗、定苗、追肥、治虫等工作，要不，棉苗就很难迅速发育。南方在今后一个时期雨多草旺，如果对棉田管理放松几天，就会发生荒苗现象。湖北省早在夏收以前就成立了专门的领导组织，加强夏收夏种和棉田抢“四快”（“四快”是在棉麦套种田快割麦、快灭茬锄草、快间苗定苗、快追肥提苗）的准备工作。由此可见，统筹安排，充分准备，就可以做好夏季生产的各个方面。（附图片）
