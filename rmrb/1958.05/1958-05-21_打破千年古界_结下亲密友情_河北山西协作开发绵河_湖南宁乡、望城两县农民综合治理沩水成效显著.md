Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 20th – Farmers from Shanxi and Hebei provinces are breaking down provincial boundaries and collaborating on the development of water conservancy on the Mian River near Niangziguan. This fresh development of breaking down thousand-year-old boundaries and forging close friendships is being widely praised in both provinces.

Niangziguan, with its beautiful mountains and rivers and strategic location, is known as the gateway to Shanxi and is separated from Hebei Province by a pass. The area is rich in water resources, with springs flowing constantly year-round along the eight-li Mian Mountains, with a total flow of 12 cubic meters per second flowing into Hebei. Farmers in both provinces have long desired to make full use of this water source, but this has not been realized for a long time. After consultation between the leading departments of Shanxi and Hebei provinces recently, a unified plan was made in the spirit of joint development and joint utilization. Shanxi Province will build a hydropower station and install pumping equipment at Niangziguan, which is now under planning and design. More than 30,000 migrant workers from 20 counties and cities in the Shijiazhuang Special Zone of Hebei Province have gathered near Niangziguan and started to build canals. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of this year. Farmers in Hebei Province will draw water from Niangziguan and build two main canals more than 200 li long for the Mian River, which can irrigate more than 250,000 mu of cultivated land in Jingxing, Pingshan, Shijiazhuang and other counties and cities. Farmers in Shanxi Province will build hydropower stations and high mountain reservoirs at the "Water Curtain Cave" waterfall, which can not only irrigate high-altitude terraced fields but also support the industrial construction of Yangquan City.

During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, the people of Hebei gave strong support to Shanxi in terms of both materials and manpower. Since 1953, mutual support between the two provinces has increased even more. In 1956, Shanxi Province launched a campaign throughout the province to support the disaster-stricken areas of Hebei. This year's joint construction of water conservancy projects has further enhanced the friendship between the people of the two provinces. According to the plan of Hebei Province, the construction of canals will occupy more than 60 mu of waterfront land, some houses, more than 20 water mills and several roads in Didu and other villages in Pindgding County, Shanxi Province. The leading organs and farmers in Pindgding County took the initiative to propose that small interests should be subordinate to large interests, and they all agreed. Cadres and farmers in Hebei Province proposed that large interests should take care of small interests, and made detailed calculations of various losses in Didu and other villages in Pingding County, and proposed reasonable compensation methods.

This newspaper reports that farmers in Ningxiang and Wangcheng counties, Hunan Province, with a spirit of socialist cooperation, have achieved remarkable results in comprehensively managing the Wei River according to basin planning, crossing county and township boundaries.

The Wei River management project mainly includes: soil and water conservation projects in the upper reaches, irrigation projects in the middle reaches, and river straightening projects in the lower reaches. These projects are carried out in conjunction with afforestation, flood control, irrigation and shipping. After more than five years of hard work by the farmers of the two counties, the Wei River has been initially controlled. The Wei River midstream irrigation project, completed in the winter of 1955, has enabled more than 110,000 mu of farmland in the two counties to be irrigated by gravity instead of waterwheels, and to be transformed from single-season rice to double-season rice, resulting in continuous bumper harvests for two years. In 1956, the average yield per mu in the irrigation area reached 750 jin, and the rice output increased by more than 30 million jin in two years. More than 30% of the soil erosion area has been basically controlled, and the waterway has also been smoother than before.

The two counties cooperated in managing the Wei River on the basis of constantly conducting education on socialist overall interests for cadres and the masses of farmers. Recently, the Huangcai Reservoir, newly built by Ningxiang, Wangcheng and Yiyang counties in cooperation on the upper reaches of the Wei River, has also begun construction. This large reservoir will occupy more than 2,800 mu of land. Cadres and the masses in Ningxiang County did not agree at first, saying: It is too uneconomical to flood our own land and irrigate other people's fields. As a result, after calculating the details, everyone's eyes were opened: The best year for the mountain fields here only yields 300 to 400 jin of grain, and even if they are all lost, it will only be a loss of 1 million jin of grain, but after the reservoir is built, it can irrigate more than 380,000 mu of land in the three counties, and these fields can all be transformed into gravity irrigation. Planting double-season rice can double the yield. At least 10 million jin of grain can be increased. Everyone raised their hands in favor of building the reservoir.

According to the plan, in the next two years, in conjunction with the continued development of soil and water conservation work, including the Huangcai Reservoir, five more large reservoirs will be built in the upper reaches of the Wei River. In this way, not only will more than one million mu of farmland in the Wei River basin be basically transformed into gravity irrigation, eliminating drought, but also in this area, even if there is a torrential rain of 200 mm in one day and night, it will not cause mountain floods.

The Wei River is a major tributary of the Xiang River. It originates in Ningxiang County, passes through Ningxiang, and flows into the Xiang River via Wangcheng County. This river has a short source, rapid water flow, and is prone to rising and falling. Every year, mountain floods are rampant. After liberation, although the people on both sides of the Wei River also built some water conservancy projects, they were carried out in a decentralized manner on the basis of a small-scale peasant economy, which still could not fundamentally solve the problem.

In the winter of 1952, the Hunan Provincial Water Conservancy Department sent technical cadres to cooperate with relevant departments of the two counties to conduct basin-wide field surveys and designs, and comprehensively plan and systematically carry out comprehensive management of the Wei River.

After the agricultural cooperativization in the spring of 1956, various places adopted the method of upstream supporting downstream, and strong cooperation between coops. At present, the soil erosion area that has been basically controlled has reached more than 160 square kilometers.

With the completion of the midstream irrigation project of the Wei River, the historical water conservancy disputes between Ning and Wang counties, as well as the contradiction between shipping and irrigation, have also been resolved. In the past, farmers in Ningxiang County in the upper reaches of the Wei River built rows of waterwheel dams on the riverbed to divert water for irrigation. In times of drought, the downstream was cut off; when the water rose, the downstream suffered. Farmers in Wangcheng County were very dissatisfied with this, and they built a long dike at the junction of the two counties to block the release of water from the upper reaches. In the past, there were more than 100 water conservancy disputes between farmers in the two counties every year, and even armed fights occurred before liberation. Now, the upstream and downstream can be irrigated, and there are no more water conservancy disputes.

In the past, the waterwheel dams built on the Wei River averaged one and a half per kilometer. During drought resistance, farmers wanted to block water, and boatmen wanted to pass the dam, and disputes often occurred. Now, the waterwheel dams have been abolished, and ship locks have been built on the canals, and sailboats can travel unimpeded. The high-quality coal and iron produced in the upper reaches of the Wei River can be transported out in a steady stream.

    打破千年古界　结下亲密友情
    河北山西协作开发绵河
    湖南宁乡、望城两县农民综合治理沩水成效显著
    新华社太原20日电　山西、河北两省农民打破省界，协作开发娘子关附近的绵河水利。这件打破千年古界结下亲密友情的新鲜事，在两省之间已传为佳话。
    娘子关附近山川秀丽，地势险要，号称山西的门户，与河北省是一关之隔。这里水源丰富，东西长达八里左右的绵山两麓泉水常年不断，总流量十二秒公方，流往河北境内。两省农民很早以前就有充分利用这股水源的愿望，但是长期得不到实现。山西、河北两省领导部门最近经过协商，按照共同开发、共同利用的精神作了统一规划。山西省将在娘子关修建水电站、安装抽水设备，现在正在筹划和设计。河北省石家庄专区二十个县、市三万多民工，已经云集到娘子关附近，开始修渠，整个工程预计今年年底完工。河北省农民从娘子关接水，给绵河修两条长达二百多里的大干渠，可以浇井陉、平山、石家庄等县、市二十五万多亩耕地。山西省农民在“水帘洞”大瀑布修建水电站、建筑高山水库，不仅能灌溉高地梯田，还能支援阳泉市工业建设。
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，河北人民曾在物力和人力上大力支援过山西。从1953年以来，两省相互支援就更多了。1956年，山西省曾在全省范围内掀起过支援河北灾区的运动。今年合伙兴修水利更加增进了两省人民的友谊。按河北省的计划，兴建渠道要占用山西省平定县地都等村六十多亩水地、部分房屋、二十多盘水磨和若干道路，平定县领导机关和农民主动提出，小利益应当服从大利益，一概允诺。河北省干部、农民提出大利益要照顾小利益，对平定县地都等村的各种损失都作了详细计算，并提出合理补偿办法。
    本报讯　湖南省宁乡、望城两县农民以社会主义大协作精神，按流域规划，穿县过乡，综合治理沩水很有成效。
    治理沩水工程主要包括：上游的水土保持工程、中游的灌溉工程和下游河道的裁弯取直工程。这些工程是结合造林、防洪、灌溉和航运等工作进行的。经过两县农民五年多的苦战，沩水已初步控制了。1955年冬天竣工的沩水中游灌溉工程，已使两个县十一万多亩农田，由车水变成自流灌溉，由一季稻变成双季稻，获得连续两年大丰收，1956年灌区内平均每亩产量达到七百五十斤，两年增产三千多万斤稻谷。水土流失面有30％以上基本上被控制了，航道也较前畅通。
    这两个县协作治理沩水，是在经常向干部和农民群众进行社会主义整体利益教育的基础上开展起来的。最近，由宁乡、望城、益阳三县合作在沩水上游新建的黄材水库，也已动工。这个大水库要占地二千八百多亩，宁乡县干部和群众开始思想都不通，说：淹自己的地，灌别人的田，太不合算。结果一算细账，打开了大家的眼界：这里的山田，最好年成也只收三、四百斤谷，都丢了也只损失一百万斤谷，可是水库修好后，能灌溉三个县三十八万多亩田，这些田都能变成自流灌溉。种上双季稻，产量能翻一翻。至少能增产一千多万斤谷。同时，水库还能拦蓄山洪发电，大家都举双手赞成修水库。
    按照规划，在今后两年内，结合继续开展水土保持工作，连黄材水库在内，在沩水上游再修建五座大水库。这样，不仅沩水流域一百多万亩农田，基本上能变成自流灌溉，消灭旱灾；而且在这个区域内即令一昼夜下暴雨二百公厘，也不致造成山洪灾害。
    沩水是湘江的一条大支流，发源于宁乡县，穿过宁乡，经望城县流入湘江，这条河源流短、水势湍急，易涨易退，每年山洪泛滥成灾。解放后，沩水两岸人民虽然也兴修了一些水利工程，但在小农经济基础上分散进行，仍然不能根本解决问题。
    1952年冬天，湖南省水利部门就派出技术干部协同两县有关部门，进行流域性的实地查勘、设计，全面规划，有计划有步骤地开展综合治理沩水工作。
    1956年春天农业合作化后，各地采取下游支援上游、社与社间通力协作的办法。现在，已基本控制的水土流失面达一百六十多平方公里。
    随着沩水中游灌溉工程的建成，带有历史性的宁、望两县的水利纠纷，以及航运与灌溉的矛盾也从此解决了。过去沩水上游的宁乡县农民在河床上筑起一道道的筒车坝，引水灌溉，天旱时，下游断流；水涨时，下游遭殃；望城县农民对此非常不满，他们在两县交界处筑起一道长堤，拦阻上游放水。过去每年两县农民发生的水利纠纷，有一百多起，在解放前甚至发生械斗事件。现在，上下游都能灌溉，再也没有水利纠纷了。
    过去，沩水上修的筒车坝，平均每一公里有一座半。抗旱时，农民要拦水，船民要过坝，也经常闹纠纷。现在，筒车坝废了，渠道上又修建了船闸，帆船往来无阻，沩水上游盛产的优质煤铁，可以源源外运。　　　　　（胡坚、罗厚仁）
