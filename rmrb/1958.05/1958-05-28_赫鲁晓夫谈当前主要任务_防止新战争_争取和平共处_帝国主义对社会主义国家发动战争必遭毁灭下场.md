Xinhua News Agency, 27th May. TASS, 26th May: At the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization held in Moscow, the head of the Soviet delegation, Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, Khrushchev, emphasized in his speech that our purpose in meeting here is not to formulate new plans to promote the arms race. Unlike the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other aggressive military blocs of Western countries, the purpose of concluding the Warsaw Treaty is solely to ensure the security of our countries and to serve the interests of consolidating peace. The participating countries of this treaty have never intended to infringe upon any country, and still do not.

Khrushchev also pointed out: The governments of all countries that rely on the "position of strength" policy should forever understand that launching a war against socialist countries can only lead to the destructive end of aggression.

At this meeting, Khrushchev put forward the following series of proposals: further unilateral reduction of the armed forces of the Warsaw Treaty participating countries, and called on the members of the North Atlantic Alliance to implement similar reductions; requested the meeting to study the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in Romania under the Warsaw Treaty; the Warsaw Treaty participating countries suggested to the members of the North Atlantic Group that both sides conclude a non-aggression pact, and suggested that immediate exchanges of views be initiated on issues related to this.

The Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers said that the further growth of the power and unity of the socialist camp countries and the strengthening of the world peace forces are the main achievements of the past two years.

Khrushchev emphasized that the main task today is to carry out a tenacious struggle for peace, to prevent the outbreak of a new war, and to strive to build relations between countries on the principles of peaceful coexistence and transactional cooperation.

Khrushchev pointed out that influential groups in imperialist countries, despite a series of obvious failures of their "position of strength" policy, are still intensifying war preparations and openly betting on preparations for war using nuclear weapons and rocket weapons.

Referring to the Algerian issue, Khrushchev pointed out that the Algerian issue should be resolved peacefully on the basis of satisfying the Algerian people's legitimate demands for self-determination and independence rights, taking into account the historical ties between France and Algeria. He pointed out that France should stop the war in Algeria. He also pointed out that the British armed forces' frequent attacks on peaceful cities and villages in Yemen aroused the indignation of all honest people.

Khrushchev went on to say that Lebanon is now also the object of conspiracies and dangerous provocations by external forces. Western countries are openly interfering in the internal affairs of this country, with the aim of establishing colonial rule there, thereby striking at the national liberation movement of the entire Arab East. Some members of the aggressive Southeast Asia Treaty Organization have embarked on the path of military intervention in the internal affairs of the Republic of Indonesia, organizing local reactionary forces there, supplying them with weapons, and even sending armed mercenaries to this country to fight against the legitimate government of Indonesia.

Referring to the summit meeting issue, Khrushchev pointed out that the attitude of Western countries towards convening a high-level meeting particularly clearly shows that the ruling groups of Western countries oppose the easing of international tensions and continue to cling to the "Cold War" policy. In order to convene this meeting as soon as possible, the Soviet government has accommodated the wishes of Western countries on a series of issues. However, it seems that Western governments are now looking for new excuses to avoid a meeting of heads of government. While delaying negotiations, Western countries are intensifying war preparations and have convened a series of meetings of military blocs such as the North Atlantic Treaty, the Southeast Asia Treaty, and the Baghdad Treaty for this purpose. The enemies of easing international tensions want to place the people of all countries before a fait accompli, exacerbate the tense atmosphere, and hinder the convening or ruin the summit meeting.

Khrushchev said that the issues we propose to discuss at the summit meeting are raised by life itself. The purpose of any of these proposals is to promote the easing of international tensions. If Westerners want to force the Soviet Union to discuss issues such as the status of Eastern European countries (deliberate interference in the internal affairs of these countries) or German reunification (as interpreted by Western countries) under the pretext of careful preparation for the meeting, then it should be stated directly that such "preparation" time is endless, because, under no circumstances will the Soviet Union ever agree to such a decision.

Khrushchev said that the summit meeting should treat with the utmost seriousness Poland's proposal to establish a zone free of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons and rocket weapons in Europe. If Western countries are worried that after the establishment of the above-mentioned zone, the Soviet Union will still maintain its superiority in conventional armaments within the scope of this zone, then a question arises: Why do Western countries reject the Soviet proposal to reduce the number of foreign troops stationed in Germany and other European countries?

Khrushchev pointed out that the United States leadership group is trying its best to arm West Germany with atomic weapons, and their plan is particularly dangerous to the cause of peace. West Germany's atomic armament tightly blocks the only remaining path to restoring German national unity—restoring unity through the mutual approach and agreement of the two Germanys.

Khrushchev emphasized that the proposal to establish atomic and rocket bases aimed at the socialist camp countries is in itself a manifestation of a thorough and aggressive policy. The news that the Soviet Union has intermediate-range rocket bases in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia is false. However, the policies of the United States and other countries in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization will inevitably force the Warsaw Treaty member states to draw corresponding conclusions for themselves. Despite their reluctance to do so, they have to consider the issue of setting up rocket weapons in the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia due to the situation. Khrushchev emphasized that he hoped that the leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would show a clear mind and not force the Warsaw Treaty member states to take retaliatory measures in setting up rocket weapons.

Khrushchev pointed out that the American personnel responsible for American foreign policy intend to avoid being retaliated against at the expense of their allies, so that American territory will not suffer the devastating consequences of a nuclear war, or at least reduce such consequences. However, intercontinental ballistic missiles and other modern combat weapons can now hit targets anywhere in the world. Khrushchev emphasized: "The Soviet Union's creation of intercontinental rockets and the launching of artificial earth satellites convincingly proved the technical potential of the Warsaw Treaty member states. Therefore, now we should not proceed from a position of strength, and one side should not intimidate the other."

Khrushchev emphasized that no leader in the United States, Britain, or France can cite even one fact to prove that the Soviet Union is taking measures that threaten the security of any country. Even today, when the Soviet Union already possesses intercontinental weapons, it is still prepared to prohibit the use of outer space for war purposes, if Western countries agree to dismantle military bases on other countries' territories.

Khrushchev condemned the US military command's constant actions of sending military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs towards the Soviet border. He also pointed out that not only do the flights of American aircraft in the Arctic region threaten the security of the Soviet Union, but their flights in the European, African, and Asian regions also threaten the security of the Soviet Union, where the United States has a huge network of air force bases.

Khrushchev said that the inspection system in the Arctic region proposed by the United States in response to the Soviet government's strong protest against the above-mentioned flights aims to gain a certain military strategic advantage by weakening the security of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that no country that cherishes its own country would agree to such a proposal.

Khrushchev talked about the Soviet Union's initiative on the universal cessation of nuclear weapons tests, and pointed out that under the conditions that have been formed, there is a way out to eliminate the threat of atomic war, which is to morally condemn the use of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev pointed out that on the issue of prohibiting the use of outer space for war purposes, the United States proposed to only prohibit intercontinental ballistic missiles, while not giving up its many military bases located in other countries. Khrushchev emphasized that the Soviet government cannot agree to create a situation in which the security of the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union is threatened.

Khrushchev said that in our era, war is no longer destined to be inevitable. The numerous contradictions between Eastern and Western countries should not be resolved in the arms race, but should be resolved in negotiations between them. Those who advocate pursuing a "position of strength" policy assert that if the "Cold War" stops and the necessity of the arms race disappears, it will lead to a reduction in production, an increase in the number of unemployed, and a decline in the living standards of the working people. Khrushchev emphasized that if the United States pursues a policy of peaceful coexistence and transactional cooperation, it will open up huge possibilities for the development of American productive forces. For example, India, People's China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, as well as the Arab East countries and the Soviet Union, could become vast markets for the sale of large quantities of American goods.

    赫鲁晓夫谈当前主要任务
    防止新战争　争取和平共处
    帝国主义对社会主义国家发动战争必遭毁灭下场
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社26日讯：在莫斯科举行的华沙条约政治协商委员会会议上，苏联代表团团长、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在发言中强调说，我们在这里开会的目的并不是为了制订鼓吹军备竞赛的新计划。同北大西洋公约组织和西方国家的其他侵略性军事集团不同，缔结华沙条约的目的完全是为了保证我们各国的安全和服务于巩固和平的利益。这一条约的参加国过去和现在都未打算侵犯任何一个国家。
    赫鲁晓夫同时指出：要让那些依靠“实力地位”政策的各国政府永远懂得，对社会主义国家发动战争只能导致侵略的毁灭的下场。
    赫鲁晓夫在这次会议上提出了下面一系列的建议：进一步单方面裁减华沙条约参加国的武装部队，并呼吁北大西洋联盟成员国也实行类似的裁减；提请会议研究撤退根据华沙条约驻扎在罗马尼亚境内的苏联军队的问题；华沙条约参加国向北大西洋集团成员国建议双方缔结互不侵犯公约，并建议就与此有关的问题立即着手交换意见。
    苏联部长会议主席说，社会主义阵营国家的威力和团结的进一步增长以及世界和平力量的加强，是最近两年来的主要成果。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，为和平、为防止爆发新战争、为争取把国与国之间的关系建筑在和平共处和事务性合作的原则上而进行顽强的斗争，是今天的主要任务。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，帝国主义国家有影响的集团不顾他们的“实力地位”政策遭到一连串明显的失败，仍在加紧战争准备，公开把赌注放在使用核武器和火箭武器的备战活动上。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到阿尔及利亚问题时指出，应当在满足阿尔及利亚人民对自决和独立权利的正当要求的基础上、考虑到法国和阿尔及利亚之间过去的历史联系，来和平地解决阿尔及利亚问题。他指出，法国应当停止阿尔及利亚的战争。他还指出，英国武装部队对也门的和平城市和村庄的经常袭击，激起了一切正直的人们的义愤。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，现在黎巴嫩也成了外部势力实行阴谋和危险挑衅的对象，西方国家在公开地干涉这个国家的内政，其目的是想在那里建立殖民统治，从而打击整个阿拉伯东方人民的民族解放运动。侵略性的东南亚条约的某些成员国走上了军事干涉印度尼西亚共和国内政的道路，在那里组织地方反动力量，供给他们武器，甚至于派遣武装的雇佣军到这个国家去同印度尼西亚的合法政府作对。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到最高级会议问题时指出，从西方国家对待召开高级会议这个问题的立场可以特别清楚地看出，西方国家的统治集团反对国际紧张局势的缓和，继续死抓住“冷战”政策不放。为了尽快召开这个会议，苏联政府已经在一系列问题上迁就了西方国家的愿望。但是，看来，西方国家政府现在正在寻找新的借口来回避政府首脑会议。西方国家一面拖延谈判，一面在加紧备战，并为此目的召开了北大西洋公约、东南亚条约、巴格达条约这些军事集团的一系列的会议。缓和国际紧张局势的敌人想把各国人民置于既成事实的面前，加剧紧张气氛，阻挠最高级会议的召开或者搞垮最高级会议。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们建议在政府首脑会议上讨论的问题，是生活本身所提出来的。其中任何一个建议的目的都是促进国际紧张局势的和缓。如果西方人士借口对会议必须进行周密的准备而想迫使苏联去讨论诸如东欧国家地位（蓄意干涉这些国家的内政）或德国统一（如西方国家对这个问题的阐释那样）之类的问题，那么应当直截了当地说，这种“准备”时间是没有个完的，因为，无论在什么条件下，苏联永远不会同意这种决定。
    赫鲁晓夫说，最高级会议应当以最认真的态度来对待波兰提出的在欧洲建立无原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器地区的建议。如果西方国家担心在上述地区建立以后，苏联在这一地区范围内还将保持自己在常规军备方面的优势，那么就产生了一个问题：为什么西方国家拒绝苏联提出的裁减驻扎在德国境内和欧洲其他国家境内外国军队人数的建议呢？
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国领导集团极力想用原子武器武装西德，他们的计划对和平事业具有特别的危险。西德的原子武装紧紧地堵塞了恢复德国民族统一的剩下的唯一道路——通过两个德国互相接近和取得协议来恢复统一的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，建立矛头指向社会主义阵营国家的原子基地和火箭基地的主张本身就是彻头彻尾的侵略政策的表现。关于苏联在德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克境内设有中程火箭基地的消息是虚假的。但是美国和北大西洋公约组织其他国家的政策必然要迫使华沙条约成员国为自己得出相应的结论。他们尽管不愿意这样做，然而迫于形势，他们不得不考虑在德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克境内设置火箭武器的问题。赫鲁晓夫强调表示，希望北大西洋公约组织领导人表现清醒的理智，不致迫使华沙条约成员国在设置火箭武器方面采取回敬措施。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，负责美国外交政策的美国人士打算用牺牲自己的同盟者作为代价来避免自己遭到回击，使美国领土不遭受核战争毁灭性的后果或者至少是减轻这种后果。但是，洲际弹道火箭和其他现代化作战武器今天已经可以击中世界任何地方的目标。赫鲁晓夫强调指出：“苏联制成洲际火箭和发射人造地球卫星，令人信服地证明了华沙条约成员国在技术上的潜力，因此，现在不应当从实力地位出发，一方不应当恫吓另一方。”
    赫鲁晓夫强调指出，美国、英国和法国没有任何一个领导人能够举出哪怕是一个事实来证明苏联在采取威胁某个国家安全的措施。就是在苏联已经拥有洲际武器的今天，它仍然准备禁止利用宇宙空间于战争目的，如果西方国家同意撤除在别国领土上的军事基地的话。
    赫鲁晓夫谴责美国军事司令部不断派遣载有原子弹和氢弹的军用飞机飞向苏联边境的行动。他还指出，不仅美国飞机在北极地区的飞行威胁着苏联的安全，而且它们在欧洲、非洲和亚洲地区的飞行也威胁着苏联的安全，在这些地区美国有着庞大的空军基地网。
    赫鲁晓夫说，美国针对苏联政府对上述飞行的坚决抗议而提出的北极地区视察制度，目的是想靠削弱苏联的安全来获得一定的军事战略上的优势。他指出，任何一个珍重自己的国家都不会同意这种建议。
    赫鲁晓夫谈到苏联在普遍停止核武器试验问题上的倡议，并且指出，在已经形成的条件下，存在着可能消除原子战争威胁的出路，这就是在道义上谴责使用原子武器和氢武器。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，美国在禁止利用宇宙空间于战争目的的问题上，提出只禁止洲际弹道火箭，同时却不放弃它设在别国境内的许许多多军事基地。赫鲁晓夫强调指出，苏联政府不能同意造成使苏联和同苏联友好的国家的安全遭到威胁的局面。
    赫鲁晓夫说，在我们的时代，战争已经不是注定不可避免的了。东西方国家之间的重重矛盾，不应当在军备竞赛中求得解决，而应当在它们之间的谈判中求得解决。主张奉行“实力地位”政策的人断言说，如果“冷战””停止，军备竞赛的必要性消失，就将使生产缩减，失业大军人数增加，劳动人民的生活水平下降。赫鲁晓夫强调说，美国如果奉行和平共处和事务性合作的政策，就会给美国生产力的发展开辟巨大的可能性。举例说，印度、人民中国、巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、伊朗以及阿拉伯东方各国和苏联，就可能成为销售美国大量商品的广阔市场。（附图片）
