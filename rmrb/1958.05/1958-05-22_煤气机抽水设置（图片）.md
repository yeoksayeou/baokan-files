Gas Engine Water Pumping Setup
Ⅰ Gas Engine, Ⅱ Water Pump, ① Cylinder Head, ② Intake Valve, ③ Exhaust Valve, ④ Spark Plug, ⑤ Cylinder, ⑥ Piston, ⑦ Connecting Rod, ⑧ Crank, ⑨ Flywheel, ⑩ Belt, ? Water Pump Casing, ? Impeller, ? Inlet Pipe, ? Outlet Pipe

From the above diagram of the gas engine water pumping setup, the force of the fuel burning and exploding in the cylinder has to be applied to the water surface to be lifted through a very complex mechanical transmission consisting of parts such as the piston, connecting rod, crank, flywheel, belt, and impeller. As a result, a lot of energy is consumed.

The actual force of the gas burning and exploding in the cylinder that is used to lift the water is only 7.5% to 12%.

    煤气机抽水设置
    Ⅰ煤气机，Ⅱ抽水机，①气缸盖，②进气阀，③排气阀，④火花塞，⑤气缸，⑥活塞，⑦连杆，⑧曲柄，⑨飞轮，⑩皮带，?抽水机壳，?叶轮，?进水管，?出水管
    从上面这个煤气机抽水设置的简图看，燃料在气缸中燃烧爆炸的力量，要通过包括活塞、连杆、曲柄、飞轮、皮带、叶轮等一套很复杂的机械传动机件，才能最后施加到要提的水面上。因而很多能量被消耗掉了。
    燃气在气缸中燃烧爆炸的力量实际用来提水的只有7.5％到12％。
