Xinhua News Agency, Fujin, 8th. According to the Sino-Soviet agreement on merchant shipping on borders and connecting rivers and lakes, the first two Soviet merchant ships sailed into the Fujin County pier on the lower reaches of the Songhua River in Heilongjiang Province at exactly 12:00 noon today. The enthusiastic scene of thousands of local residents welcoming the Soviet merchant ships at the pier evoked memories of the people here welcoming the Soviet Red Army liberating Northeast China in 1945.

This noon, as soon as the masts of the two Soviet merchant ships appeared on the horizon, the pier was full of welcoming people. The merchant ships slowly docked amidst music and applause.

A mass rally was held at the pier to welcome the Soviet merchant ships. Du Changyou, Deputy Director of the Department of Transportation of Heilongjiang Province, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Committee. He pointed out that the people of China and the Soviet Union are now in the great historical period of economic construction. Under this new situation, the opening of navigation on the connecting rivers between the two countries is of great significance.

    根据中苏通航协定
    首批苏联商船到达富锦县
    新华社富锦8日电　根据中苏国境及其相通河流和湖泊的商船通航协定，首批两艘苏联商船，今天中午十二时正开进黑龙江省松花江下游的富锦县码头。几千名当地居民在码头上欢迎苏联商船的热烈情景，使人回想起1945年这里的人民欢迎解放东北的苏联红军的情形。
    今天中午，当两只苏联商船的桅杆刚刚在水平线上露出，码头上就站满了欢迎的人。商船在乐声和掌声中徐徐靠岸。
    在码头上举行了欢迎苏联商船的群众大会。黑龙江省交通厅副厅长杜长友代表黑龙江省人民委员会致欢迎辞。他指出，现在中苏两国人民都处在经济建设的伟大历史时期。在这种新形势下，两国相通的河流开始通航，有着重要的意义。
