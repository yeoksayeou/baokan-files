Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 30th. According to a report by the German News Agency: After arriving in Berlin on the 28th at the invitation of the government of the German Democratic Republic, Soviet Council of Ministers First Deputy Chairman Mikoyan left Berlin by plane on the 29th and returned to Moscow. Hundreds of thousands of Berliners took to the streets to warmly see off the Soviet guests.

Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, hosted a banquet in the Government Hall on the 29th in honor of Soviet Council of Ministers First Deputy Chairman Mikoyan and his entourage. Grotewohl and Mikoyan spoke at the banquet.

In his speech, Grotewohl pointed out: This is not Mikoyan's first visit to the German Democratic Republic, but it is his first visit to both Germanys at the same time. This event once again demonstrates to the world the fact that two Germanys exist. Grotewohl said, "It would be beneficial if all politicians in West Germany considered this reality in their political thinking."

Grotewohl then said: People are increasingly convinced that the only possible way to solve the issue of German reunification is through rapprochement and understanding between the two Germanys and the establishment of a confederation by the two Germanys.

In his speech, Mikoyan pointed out that friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic had existed for a long time, and then said that we are also trying to establish good relations with the Federal Republic of Germany. If we succeed in this regard, it will help maintain and consolidate peace in Europe. Fighting for peace is our common and primary task. In this struggle, all possible conditions must be utilized and all obstacles must be overcome.

    米高扬访问民主德国
    苏德坚决共同致力争取和平
    据新华社30日讯　据德意志通讯社柏林讯：苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬应德意志民主共和国政府邀请于28日到达柏林后，已经在29日乘飞机离开柏林，返回莫斯科。成千上万的柏林人来到大街上热烈送别苏联客人。
    德意志民主共和国总理格罗提渥29日在政府大厅设宴招待苏联部长会议第一副主席米高扬和随行人员。格罗提渥和米高扬先后在宴会上讲了话。
    格罗提渥在讲话中指出：米高扬访问德意志民主共和国已经不是第一次，但是他在一次访问中同时访问了两个德国却是第一次。这件事情再一次向世界表明了两个德国的存在这个事实。格罗提渥说：“西德的所有政界人士在政治观念中考虑这个现实，是会有好处的。”
    格罗提渥接着说：人们越来越相信：要解决德国的统一问题，两个德国之间的接近和谅解以及由两个德国建立邦联是唯一可能的道路。
    米高扬在讲话中指出苏联和德意志民主共和国之间的友好关系早已存在这个事实以后说，我们也在试图同德意志联邦共和国建立良好关系。如果我们在这方面获得成功，这将有助于维持和巩固欧洲和平。为和平而斗争是我们共同的首要任务。在这个斗争中，必须利用一切可能的条件和克服各种障碍。
