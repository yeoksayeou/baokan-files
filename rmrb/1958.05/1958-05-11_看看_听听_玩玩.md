　　Peonies and Wisteria are Blooming Beautifully
　　The peonies in Zhongshan Park are in full bloom, with large and brightly colored flowers. Although a small part is about to wither, famous varieties such as "Guanyin Face", "Drunken Immortal Peach", and "Ge Jin Purple" are in full bloom.
　　Also, there are many wisteria trees in Zhongshan Park, and they are also blooming now. They are even more beautiful when climbing on the ancient cypresses. Looking at them under the lamplight at night, the purple flowers look like bunches of ripe grapes.

    牡丹、藤萝开得好
    中山公园的牡丹开得正好，花朵大，色娇艳，虽有小部分将要开谢，但名种“观音面”、“醉仙桃”、“葛巾紫”等正盛开。
    又，中山公园内藤萝树很多，现在也正开花，攀结在古柏上的更为好看。夜晚在灯影下看去，紫色的花朵像一串串成熟了的葡萄。
