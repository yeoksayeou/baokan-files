Our Family
Beijing Fourth Middle School Li Xiaoyan

　　In the evening, a gentle breeze blows, and the fragrance of flowers fills the courtyard. I stepped into the house, Dad and my younger sister had not yet returned; Mom was quietly doing her homework under the lamp.

　　"Xiaoyan," Mom pointed to the pot on the stove, "the food is all inside, eat it while it's hot!"

　　"Mom, let's wait for them to come back and eat together." I answered, picking up Mom's notebook. "Mom, you're attending night school? Your handwriting is so neat!"

　　"Mom has to leap forward too," she said cheerfully, "Yesterday the street rectification proposed to eliminate illiteracy within three months, Mom has to remove this label too!"

　　"Mom! You will definitely remove it!" I looked at Mom, "Every night, let my younger sister help you learn to read, and I'll sweep the floor, wash the dishes, and tidy up the house."

　　As I finished speaking, my younger sister's lively and cheerful singing came from the courtyard.

　　"Yaya is always singing and dancing and is constantly happy!" Mom said, and my younger sister flew in, "Oh! Your father's clothes, how did you bring them back?"

　　"I worked with him!" my younger sister gasped.

　　"What?"

　　My younger sister put down the clothes and explained to Mom: "Our school launched the 'Three Diligences' movement and signed a contract with my father's factory. Today I went to work and happened to be with my father. We are both apprentices!"

　　Mom said: "This child, can't even explain clearly! Your father is doing Party work, how could he become an apprentice?"

　　"They are working on an experimental plot!"

　　Dad came back, and everyone sat around the round table.

　　"Mom! You always do this!" My younger sister pouted, using her chopsticks to push away a piece of lean meat Mom put in her bowl, "These days, classmates have put up several big-character posters criticizing me, saying I'm spoiled; please don't pamper me anymore!"

　　"Hey, how powerful!" Dad laughed, "Big-character posters are really effective!"

　　"Dad, how are the big-character posters at your place, do you get a lot of watermelons?" I asked.

　　"Hey! That's indispensable, he's the Party Secretary!" Mom looked at Dad with a smile, "I wouldn't say he has all five airs, but he probably has a bit of official air and senile air."

　　"And lazy air. For example, Dad comes home and collapses on the bed, never helping Mom. He also doesn't tell us about the domestic and international situation, revolutionary stories, just smokes, smokes, choking people until they cough!"

　　"This big-character poster is of high quality, persuasive, I accept it as a watermelon!" Dad said, and everyone laughed.

　　"These days, I saw my older brother smile for the first time," my younger sister is always talkative, "I don't know what's on his mind?"

　　These words made me uneasy, my heart beat very fast, I had to pour out the inner secret:

　　"Dad, Mom, I have decided not to take the college entrance exam, but to go to the countryside to work, transform my thinking, and transform the countryside! Dad, this is the letter of determination submitted to the Party branch."

　　Dad quickly finished reading the letter of determination and said: "Very good. This is a sign of ambition, I support it. However, your estimation of the difficulties is not sufficient, and you don't have a proper plan for yourself. I will have a good talk with you one of these days."

　　"Older brother, I congratulate you! I follow your example! I wish you to be red in the countryside, and specialized in the countryside!" My younger sister said, "I'll go to your place to work during the summer vacation!"

　　Dad opened the window, and the spring breeze brought in the fragrance of lilacs. I went to wash the dishes, my younger sister was cleaning up the dinner table, and she started singing the song "Socialism is Good" again. The whole family hummed along, and Dad even gently tapped the glass to keep the beat.

    我们一家　　　　　
    北京第四中学　李小燕
    傍晚，微风轻轻吹拂，满院的花香芬芳扑鼻。我踏进家门，爸爸和妹妹还没有回来；妈妈在灯下静静地做什么功课。
    “小燕，”妈妈指着搭在火上的锅，“饭菜都在里面，快趁热吃吧！”
    “妈妈，等他们回来一块吃。”我回答着，顺手拿起妈妈的本本：“妈，您上夜校了？看您写的字多工正！”
    “妈妈也得跃进，”她爽快地说，“昨儿个街道整风，提出三月内扫掉文盲，妈也得摘掉这顶帽子呀！
    “妈妈！准能摘掉！”我望着妈妈，“每天晚上，让妹妹帮您识字，我扫地、洗碗，收拾屋子。”
    我的话刚落，院里送来妹妹活泼愉快的歌声。
    “雅雅整天价总是唱啊、跳啊的乐个不停！”妈妈说着，妹妹就飞进来了，“哟！你爸爸的衣服，你怎样拿回来的？”
    “我跟他一起工作啦！”妹妹喘着气。
    “什么？”
    妹妹将衣服放下，向妈妈解释：“我们学校展开‘三勤’运动，跟我爸爸的厂子订了合同。今天我去干活，恰好跟爸爸在一块儿。我们都是学徒工！”
    妈妈说：“这孩子，话都说不明白！你爸爸是搞党的工作的，多会儿又当起学徒来的？”
    “人家在搞试验田嘛！”
    爸爸回来了，大家围着圆桌坐下来。
    “妈妈！您总是这样！”妹妹?着嘴，用筷子拨开妈夹给她的一块瘦肉，“这几天，同学给我贴了好几张大字报，说我娇气；您就别再溺爱我啦！”
    “嘿，好厉害！”爸爸笑了，“大字报可真顶事呀！”
    “爸爸，你们那里的大字报怎样，送给您的西瓜多吗？”我问。
    “嘿！那还少得了，他是党委书记呀！”妈笑着看着爸爸，“不敢说五气俱全，恐怕也有点官气、暮气。”
    “还有惰气。比方，爸爸回来就往床上一倒，从来不帮妈妈的忙。也不给我们讲讲国内外形势，革命故事，总是抽烟，抽烟，呛得人直咳嗽！”
    “这张大字报质量高，有说服力，我当西瓜抱了！”，爸爸说着，大家都笑了。
    “这几天，我第一次看见哥哥笑，”妹妹就是话多，“他不知道有什么心事儿？”
    这句话，使我不安起来，心跳动得很厉害，只好将内心的秘密倾吐出来：
    “爸爸，妈妈，我决定不考大学啦，去农村劳动，改造思想，改造农村！爸爸，这是递给党支部的决心书。”
    爸爸很快地看完了决心书说：“很好。这是有志气的表现，我支持。不过，你对困难的估计不够充分，对自己也没有一个适当的规划，哪天我要好好跟你谈谈。”
    “哥哥，我向你祝贺！向你看齐！祝你红在农村，专在农村！”妹妹说，“暑假我到你那儿去劳动！”
    爸爸打开了窗门，春风带着丁香的芬芳吹进来。我去洗碗，妹妹收拾着饭桌，她又唱起了“社会主义好”的歌曲。全家都哼起来，爸爸还轻轻地敲着玻璃打拍子。
