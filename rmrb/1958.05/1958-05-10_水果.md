Fruit has seasonal characteristics and is prone to spoilage. Therefore, attention must be paid to fruit processing methods to ensure that raw materials can be used rationally. In the past, China had many methods for processing fruit, but most of them only used a portion of the raw materials and failed to comprehensively and rationally utilize them, which is very regrettable. For example, when making candied fruit and preserves, only the fruit juice is extracted, and the fruit is boiled with sugar, discarding all the juice. When producing orange peel and tangerine peel, only the outer skin of the fruit is taken, and the pulp is not utilized at all. As for fruit peels, pits, cores, etc., no attention is paid to their utilization at all. Producing canned fruit is a more rational way to utilize fruit, but the utilization rate is still very low. For example, the Shantou Fruit Processing Factory, when producing canned pineapple, can only obtain fruit flesh that meets the standards for canned fruit in syrup under normal quality conditions, accounting for only 33% to 35% of all raw materials (local pineapple varieties only account for 20% to 22%). The Luda Cannery, when producing canned apples, discards 167 tons of apple peels from every 1,000 tons of apples. Adding the discarded seed nests, the total waste amounts to about 410 tons. The utilization rate of tangerines in various factories is even lower.

Last year, significant progress was made in the comprehensive utilization of raw materials in various factories. The cost of tangerines used in Shanghai was 350 yuan per ton. After comprehensive utilization, the cold-pressed tangerine oil, tangerine pith, and tangerine seeds obtained were worth 290.6 yuan, accounting for more than 83% of the value of the raw materials. Shantou canned pineapple, using 1.7 tons of raw materials, can produce one ton of canned pineapple in syrup, and the peels and pineapple cores can produce 365 kilograms of fruit juice, which accounts for 42.5% of the raw material price.

The Xiamen Cannery uses one ton of loquats to make 55 kilograms of jelly from the peel, and the pits can be used to make 88 kilograms of 40-proof white spirit.

Apple processing generally produces less waste, but last year, Luda made soft candy from apple peels and apple pulp from crushed flesh.

These examples illustrate that as long as any waste material can be comprehensively utilized, it can greatly increase the country's wealth. Moreover, after these fruit residues are utilized, they can be fermented and used as feed or fertilizer.

This method of comprehensively utilizing fruit does not require any complicated equipment, and the production method is very simple. In the mountainous areas, a large number of fruit processing factories will be built. These factories should greatly promote the comprehensive utilization of raw materials.

    水果
    水果的特性是有季节性，容易烂，因此，必须注意水果的加工方法，使原料能够合理使用。我国过去有不少加工水果的方法，大半是只用了原料的一部分，没有能综合合理利用，这是很可惜的。如做果脯蜜饯，都是只榨去果汁，用糖熬煮而成，并且把果汁全部丢掉。制造橙皮、桔皮，只取水果的外皮，果肉全部不利用。至于果皮、果核、果心等，就根本没有注意利用。生产水果罐头对水果的利用比较合理，但利用率还是很低。如汕头水果加工厂生产菠萝罐头，在质量正常的情况下能够符合糖水罐头利用标准的果肉，只占全部原料的33％到35％（土种菠萝仅占20％到22％）。旅大罐头厂生产苹果罐头，一千吨苹果，去掉的果皮就有一百六十七吨，加上去下来的籽巢，就有四百一十吨左右。至于各厂对桔子的利用率就更低。
    去年一年内，各厂对原料的综合利用有了显著成果。上海使用的桔子每吨三百五十元，综合利用后，所得冷榨桔油、桔络、桔核就值二百九十元六角，占原料价值的83％以上。汕头菠萝罐头，用一点七吨原料除制成一吨糖水菠萝外，皮和菠萝心共可出果汁三百六十五公斤，它的价值占原料价的42.5％。
    厦门罐头厂用一吨枇杷，把皮制成五十五公斤果冻，果核可做四十度白酒八十八公斤。
    苹果加工一般出的废料较少，但去年旅大把果皮制成软糖，碎肉制成苹果浆。
    这些事例说明：不论那种废料，只要能够综合利用，就可为国家大大增加财富，而且这些水果的果渣被利用后，经过醱酵，还能作饲料或肥料。
    这种综合利用水果的办法，既不需要什么复杂设备，生产方法又很简单。现在各地山区将大量兴建水果加工厂，这些工厂应该大大推广综合利用原料的办法。
