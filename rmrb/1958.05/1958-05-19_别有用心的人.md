    People With Ulterior Motives
    After the third red giant star went into space, American newspapers of course also talked about its great scientific value, but they seemed to pay more attention to the large rocket that sent the large satellite into orbit. For example, an editorial in the American "Daily Mirror" wrote: "Our (American) scientists believe that the launch of the new satellite means that the Russians have developed an engine with a thrust of three million pounds or more, meaning that the Russians have the ability to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of five thousand miles carrying large military warheads, meaning that the Russians may be preparing to launch rockets to the moon."
    The "Daily Mirror" also frankly admitted: "What about our own affairs? We should not be overly optimistic in this regard. We are behind, we have always been behind."
    This is how the American monopoly capitalist newspapers use Soviet scientific achievements to write "military" articles, never missing any opportunity to serve the US policy of arms expansion and war preparations.

    别有用心的人
    第三个红色巨星上天后，美国报纸当然也谈了它的巨大的科学价值，但是它们似乎更注意把大卫星送上轨道的大火箭。例如美国“每日镜报”的社论就这样写道：“我们（美国）的科学家认为，新的卫星的发射意味着俄国人已经制成推动能力达三百万磅或更大的发动机，意味着俄国人已经可能发射五千哩射程的带大型军用弹头的洲际弹道火箭，意味着俄国人可能正在准备向月球发射火箭。”
    “每日镜报”并且坦率地承认：“我们自己的事情怎样呢？我们在这方面不应过分乐观。我们落在后面了，我们一直落在后面。”
    美国垄断资本的报纸就是这样利用苏联科学成就来大做“军事”论文，从不放过任何一次机会来为美国的扩军备战政策服务。
