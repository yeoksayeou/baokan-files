CCP Qinghai Provincial Committee Directs Agricultural Region Counties: Water Conservancy Construction Cannot Relax Field Management

    (Our Newspaper News) In order to overcome the current tendency of only paying attention to water conservancy construction while neglecting field management, the CCP Qinghai Provincial Committee held a telephone conference on the evening of May 3rd, instructing all counties in the agricultural region to immediately focus on field management tasks such as checking seedlings, replanting seedlings, watering, weeding, and sowing late-season crops.
    According to recent inspections by the CCP Qinghai Provincial Committee, all counties in the agricultural region have shown great enthusiasm for water conservancy construction, but many counties and regions have a tendency to abandon field management. For example, in Xingming Township, Minhe County, out of more than 3,300 mu of land, 1,100 mu are missing seedlings. In Fujiazhai, a suburb of Xining, there are 250,000 to 300,000 seedlings per mu in first-class wheat fields, while there are only 120,000 to 130,000 seedlings per mu in third-class fields. In many areas, weeds and seedlings are growing together, and labor has not yet been organized to remove them. Late-season crops such as flax are also being neglected.
    The conference required leaders at the county and township levels to specifically arrange labor and, while carrying out water conservancy construction, must also do a good job in field management. (Guang Yuan)

### 中共青海省委指示农业区各县  修水利不能放松田间管理

    中共青海省委指示农业区各县
    修水利不能放松田间管理
    本报讯　为克服当前存在的只注意兴修水利而忽视田间管理的倾向，中共青海省委于5月3日晚召开了电话会议，指示农业区各县立即把查苗、补苗、浇水、除草和晚田播种等田间管理工作抓起来。
    中共青海省委根据最近检查的情况看，农业区各县对兴修水利劲头都很大，但有不少县份和地区有放弃田间管理的倾向。如民和县兴明乡三千三百多亩地，缺苗的就有一千一百亩；西宁郊区的傅家寨一等麦田每亩有二十五万到三十万株苗，而三等田只有十二万到十三万株苗；有不少地区的麦田草苗一齐长，还没有组织劳动力进行拔除；对于胡麻等晚田作物也有所忽视。
    会议要求县、乡各级领导具体安排劳动力，在兴修水利的同时，必须把田间管理工作搞好。  （光远）
