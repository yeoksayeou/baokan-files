Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 25th: Indonesian military authorities announced on the evening of May 25th that government forces had recaptured the Sangihe-Talaud Islands, located between North Sulawesi and the Philippines, on May 21st.

This archipelago consists of the two larger islands of Sangihe and Talaud, as well as several smaller islands. The northernmost island of Talaud is about 300 kilometers from Davao in the Philippines, closer than it is to Sulawesi. The United States and the Philippines are using Davao as a base to assist the Indonesian rebel group. When the rebels occupied the Sangihe-Talaud Islands, they used these islands as an important liaison point between the rebels and the Philippines.

Military authorities also announced on the evening of May 25th that two fully armed companies of rebels on Morotai Island surrendered to government forces on May 24th. Government forces recaptured the important airport on Morotai Island on May 20th.

    印度尼西亚政府军又传捷报
    收复珊枝—塔劳群岛
    切断北苏拉威西叛军和菲律宾的联络站
    新华社雅加达25日电　印度尼西亚军事当局25日晚间宣布，政府军在21日收复北苏拉威西和菲律宾之间的珊枝—塔劳群岛。
    这个群岛是由珊枝和塔劳两个较大的岛屿以及若干较小的岛屿组成的。在极北面的塔劳岛离菲律宾的纳卯约三百多公里，比离苏拉威西更近。美国和菲律宾以纳卯作为帮助印度尼西亚叛乱集团的基地。当叛乱分子占据珊枝—塔劳群岛的时候，他们把这些岛屿作为叛乱分子和菲律宾之间重要联络地点。
    军事当局25日晚间还宣布，摩罗泰岛上的两连全副武装的叛乱分子24日向政府军投降。政府军在20日收复了摩罗泰岛上的重要机场。
