　　University Students' Initiative
　　Li Guo, Tsinghua University Student
    Near our student club, there's a big-character poster proposing to reduce food expenses. Many other big-character posters supporting them are also posted around.

    The proposal mentions: Our country is building socialism with an overwhelming momentum, and all aspects are undergoing a great leap forward. Therefore, more and more funds are needed to invest in industrial and agricultural construction. However, the living standards of university students, as consumers of material wealth, are much higher than those of the broad working people. This is a truly unreasonable phenomenon. It also fosters individualistic thoughts of some people seeking enjoyment, unwilling to work in factories and rural areas, afraid of hardship, and not developing a diligent and thrifty style in life.

    Currently, many higher education institutions have already reduced their food expenses: Nanjing Institute of Technology from 12.5 yuan to 10.5 yuan, and higher education institutions in Chongqing and Chengdu from 10.5 yuan to 9 yuan. Students are even more motivated to study than before. Cadres sent to lower levels also told us that they are now living on 9-10 yuan, eating coarse grains, but their bodies are healthier. Some people use mental labor as an excuse and are unwilling to reduce food expenses. However, the mental labor of cadres in rural areas and cooperatives is no less than ours, but their food expenses are only 6-7 yuan. In the early days of liberation, university students ate sorghum, and their studies and health were still good, weren't they? The comrades of the People's Liberation Army eat millet and vegetables (rarely eat meat), and aren't they all glowing with health?

    Although saving two yuan of food expenses per month for each of us has no impact on the individual, it is a large amount of wealth when gathered together: reaching 10,056,000 yuan, enough for more than 130,000 farmers to eat for a year. More importantly, it makes our lives like those of workers and peasants, which is of great help in transforming our thinking.

　　大学生的倡议
　　清华大学学生　里果
    在我们学生俱乐部附近，张贴着一张倡议减低伙食费的大字报。周围也张贴着很多支持他们的大字报。
    倡议中谈到：我们的国家正以排山倒海之势建设着社会主义，各方面都在大跃进，因此需要越来越多的资金投入工农业建设。但是作为物质财富消费者的大学生的生活水平，反而比广大劳动人民高得多，这真是一种不合理的现象。这样也助长了有些人的贪图享受的个人主义思想，不愿意到工厂和农村去工作，怕吃苦，在生活里也没有养成克勤克俭的风气。
    目前很多高等学校已经降低了他们的伙食费：南京工学院由十二点五元——十点五元，重庆、成都的高等学校由十点五元——九元，同学们比过去的学习劲头更足了。下放干部也告诉我们，他们现在过着九——十元的生活，吃着粗粮，身体却更健壮了。有些人以脑力劳动为借口，不愿意降低伙食费，可是农村和合作社的干部的脑力劳动并不比我们少，他们的伙食费却只有六——七元，解放初期大学生吃高粱米，学习、身体不也很好吗？解放军同志吃小米和蔬菜（很少吃肉），他们个个不也是满面红光吗？
    虽然我们每个人每月节约二元的伙食费对个人没有什么影响，但集合起来却是一笔很大的财富：达一千零五十六万元，足够十三万多农民吃一年。更重要的使我们的生活工农化，对改造我们的思想是有很大作用的。
