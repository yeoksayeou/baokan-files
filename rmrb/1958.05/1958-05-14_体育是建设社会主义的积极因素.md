Sports are a Positive Factor in Building Socialism
Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission

    We sports workers fully support the general line of our Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, which calls for going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and we are determined to strive to realize this general line.

    To realize this general line, we must do everything possible to rapidly develop social productive forces. The decisive factor in rapidly developing productive forces is people. To liberate people's minds, bring into play their enthusiasm and creativity, make them masters of society and masters of nature, and enable them to possess a great communist spirit, we must rely on politics and moral education. To enable people to have knowledge, culture, science, and labor skills, we must rely on technology and intellectual education. But the reason why people can use their minds, improve their cultural and scientific knowledge, and labor is that they have healthy minds and healthy bodies. Without a healthy body, a person cannot become a productive force, let alone develop productive forces. Therefore, in addition to developing moral and intellectual education, we must also develop physical education.

    This is Chairman Mao's instruction. In his report on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, Chairman Mao instructed: "The educated should be developed morally, intellectually, and physically."

    In the past, in the era of "he who excels in learning becomes an official," "those who labor with their minds govern, and those who labor with their strength are governed by others," and when literature was valued over martial arts, physical education was looked down upon; even in today's socialist era, which advocates labor to create the world and gradually eliminate the distinction between mental and physical labor, some people still do not understand the importance of physical education. Therefore, in ancient times, there were cases like Yan Hui, the second sage, dying young; and great writers like Jia Yi and Wang Bo having short lives; and today, there are also cases of people going from school to the hospital, having only revolutionary enthusiasm but lacking physical conditions, or being in the hospital by the time they are forty or fifty years old.

    Chairman Mao has pointed out the importance of moral, intellectual, and physical education many times. Forty years ago, Chairman Mao said in an article: "The body is the vehicle of knowledge and the abode of morality. Its carrying of knowledge is like a car, and its dwelling of morality is like a house. The body is the car that carries knowledge and the house that dwells in morality." He also said: "Physical education, matched with moral and intellectual education, and moral and intellectual education are all based on the body. Without the body, there is no moral and intellectual education." Aren't these principles the simplest and most obvious? Isn't this a natural law? But it is precisely these simple principles that some people do not understand.

    Some people have proposed that labor can replace physical education. This is incorrect. Labor can play a role in exercising the body, but labor and physical education are ultimately two different things. Because the direct purpose of labor is to create material wealth, the labor process has certain operational forms, most of which are limited to repeated activities and fixed postures of local parts of the body. The scope and nature of physical activity are greatly restricted, so the effect of exercising the body is not comprehensive. Long-term local labor can even cause deformed development of the body and occupational diseases and defects. However, physical exercise can be free from the restrictions of long-term fixed operational forms, and can consciously use scientific methods to conduct systematic and comprehensive exercise of the body, so that the human body can develop in a balanced way, prevent deformities, and enhance labor capacity.

    Does physical exercise have such great benefits? Yes, Chairman Mao wrote in an article forty years ago that physical education can strengthen muscles and bones, increase knowledge, regulate emotions, and strengthen will. Because it can promote the human body's metabolism, so that the digestive system, respiratory system, blood circulation system, and nervous system can all work more effectively; it can exercise people's strength, endurance, speed, and agility; it can cultivate people's courage, perseverance, determination to win, and unwillingness to admit defeat, as well as collectivist and communist moral qualities. We have seen that many people who seriously engage in physical exercise often grow tall and strong, with strong muscles and bones, agile hands and feet, keen ears and eyes, flexible thinking, vigorous spirit, and full of fighting spirit and drive. These are precisely the excellent physical and mental qualities that builders of socialism and communism and defenders of the socialist motherland must possess. In practice, countless examples prove that people who regularly persist in physical exercise have strengthened their physique, reduced diseases, and thus greatly improved their efficiency in learning, work, and labor. For example, in Wuhuayuan Village, Gaotang County, Shandong Province, because they persisted in physical exercise, the incidence of disease in the whole village dropped from 13.2% in 1951 to 1.5% in 1957, and the labor attendance rate reached more than 90%. Last year, when there was an influenza epidemic, no one got sick. However, Wanghuayuan Village, which is one mile away from the village, was severely affected by the flu epidemic and failed to complete the sowing task. Therefore, it can be said that physical exercise can bring into play people's greatest labor ability and creativity, promote the rapid development of social productive forces, and also enhance national defense capabilities. As for defense sports, it can not only enhance physical fitness, but also enable people to learn preliminary military knowledge and skills, which has a more important significance for enhancing national defense capabilities.

    The extent to which physical exercise is carried out is a reflection of the development of economic and cultural life, and it also affects the development of economic and cultural life. With the improvement of economic and cultural life, physical exercise will inevitably be rapidly developed, and the development of physical exercise will further promote the improvement of economic and cultural life.

    With the improvement of economic life, people demand a richer and more colorful cultural life. Cultural life is the superstructure. It is a reflection of the economic base, and it promotes the development of the economic base and serves the economic base. Physical exercise is one of the most interesting, beneficial, and healthy cultural activities. Now some people say that they have cloth tickets, oil tickets, and food tickets, but they lack theater tickets and ball game tickets, which shows people's interest in sports activities.

    Some people say that after a day of hard work, wouldn't doing sports activities increase people's fatigue? That's not right. As I said just now, labor is mostly repeated activities and fixed postures of local parts of the body, and the more detailed the division of labor, the more it has this characteristic. Because a part of the muscles and nervous system of the laborer is in an excited state, while another part of the muscles and nervous system is in an inhibited state. Physical exercise can make the part of the muscles and nerves that are in an inhibited state due to labor be in an excited state, and make the part of the muscles and nerves that are in an excited state due to labor be in an inhibited state, so that they can get rest. The movements of exercise are different from labor, and the attention is also different. It is precisely because of this that exercise is an active rest, which can help people quickly eliminate fatigue.

    Physical exercise emphasizes competition, and competition is a method of comparing heights, winning and losing, and advanced and backward. And height, winning and losing, advanced, and backward are a major event involving the honor of the collective and the country. Who wants to fail in the competition? Not daring to win, not daring to be advanced, being content to be backward, and willing to yield are all manifestations of slave thinking. China's socialist cause is advancing at a flying speed in all aspects. This is the leadership of the Party, the liberation of the people, and the proof of the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. If only physical exercise lags behind in world competitions, and only physical exercise cannot show the superiority of the socialist system, this is of course not right. Physical exercise must also catch up. Facts have proved that under the leadership of the Party, the Chinese people can not only create excellent results in sports, but also create world records. Of course, we cannot rely on world records to eat, but being able to create excellent results can always arouse people's collective sense of honor. Collective sense of honor is by no means a bad thing. It encourages people to have the ambition to dare to win and go further. This is in line with the principle of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Some people say that we have survived in the past without sports. Yes, it was okay to have no sports in the past. But today we need sports. Today we are building socialism, and there are higher requirements for people's bodies. We cannot say that because there was no need for it in the past, there is no need for it now. We must see if it is needed. Our ancestors plowed the land for thousands of years by human, cattle, or horse power, but now we want to use tractors and machines; our ancestors for thousands of years were content to walk, ride in sedan chairs, but now we want to take airplanes, trains, and cars. In the past, our working people did not have sports. They were happy as long as they had a bowl of rice to eat, so it was said that it was rare for a person to live to seventy since ancient times. Now we are people of the socialist era. We must not only transform society, but also transform nature. In this tense, heated, and lasting struggle, we must persevere, and we must continue to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. This requires moral, intellectual, and physical education, and we must educate the people to become cultured and healthy laborers with socialist consciousness.

    Based on the above points, we believe that sports are a positive factor in building socialism, and an indispensable undertaking in the socialist construction cause. Therefore, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we must vigorously carry out mass sports activities, and on the basis of the widespread development of sports activities, accelerate the improvement of sports technology, and strive to catch up with the world level in major sports in about ten years. This is not only necessary, but also possible.

    To enhance the people's physique, make sports better serve production, and win victories in sports competitions, we must make China's sports industry leap forward with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The sports industry is a mass undertaking, a cause related to the health of 600 million people, a major event related to building socialism better, and a major event related to the happiness of future generations, so the whole Party must support this cause and run this cause. All sports workers, needless to say, must continue to make unremitting efforts and dedicate everything to this cause.

### 体育是建设社会主义的积极因素

　　体育是建设社会主义的积极因素
　　体育运动委员会副主任　荣高棠
    我们体育工作者对于我们的党中央和毛主席提出的鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，完全拥护，并且坚决为实现这个总路线而奋斗。
    要实现这条总路线，就必须想尽一切方法迅速地发展社会生产力。迅速地发展生产力的决定因素是人。要解放人的思想，发挥人的积极性、创造性，作社会的主人，作大自然的主人，要使人具有伟大的共产主义精神，这就要靠政治，靠德育。要使人有知识，有文化，有科学，有劳动技能，这就要靠技术，靠智育。但是人之所以能用思想，能提高文化、科学知识，能劳动，还靠着有健康的头脑，健康的身体。人没有健康的身体，既不成其为生产力，更谈不到发展生产力了。所以除了发展德育、智育之外，还要发展体育。
    这是毛主席的指示。主席在关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的报告中指示说：“应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展。”
    在过去，学而优则仕，劳心者治人、劳力者治于人，重文轻武的时代，体育是被轻视的；就是在当今主张劳动创造世界，要逐渐消除体力劳动和脑力劳动的区别的社会主义时代，也还有人不够理解体育的重要性。所以在古代，就有颜回那样的第二号圣人早死；贾谊、王勃那样的大文人短命；而在今天也还有出学院入医院，光有革命热情、缺乏身体条件或才到四、五十岁就以医院为家的情况了。
    关于德、智、体三育并重的道理，毛主席不只一次指出过了。四十年前毛主席在一篇文章中就说：“体者，为知识之载而为道德之寓者也。其载知识也如车，其寓道德也如舍。体者，载知识之车而寓道德之舍也。”又说：“体育一道，配德育与智育，而德智皆寄于体。无体是无德智也。”这些道理不是最简单最明显么？这难道不是自然规律么？但正是这些浅显的道理，却有一部分人对它并不了解。
    有人提出了劳动可以代替体育的说法。这是不正确的。劳动是可以起锻炼身体的作用，但劳动和体育终究是两回事。因为劳动的直接目的是为了创造物质财富，劳动过程都有一定的操作形式，这些形式大都是限于身体局部的反复活动和固定姿势的动作，身体活动的范围和性质受到很大的限制，因此锻炼身体的作用就很不全面。长期局部劳动的结果，甚至可引起身体的畸形发展和职业性的疾病和缺陷。而体育运动却可以不受长期的固定操作形式的限制，可以有意识地运用科学方法对身体进行系统而全面的锻炼，因而可以使人体均衡地发展，防止产生畸形，增强劳动能力。
    体育运动有这么大的好处么？是的，毛主席在四十年前写的文章中就说体育能强筋骨，增知识，调感情，强意志。因为，它能促进人体的新陈代谢作用，使消化系统、呼吸系统、血液循环系统和神经系统等都能更有力地工作；它能锻炼人的力量、耐力、速度、灵敏；它能培养人的勇敢、坚毅、争胜利、不服输等集体主义和共产主义的道德品质。我们看到有许多认真进行体育锻炼的人，往往长得身高体大，筋骨强壮，手脚灵巧，耳聪目明，思想灵活，精神奋发，斗志昂扬，干劲十足。这些正是社会主义和共产主义建设者、社会主义祖国的保卫者所必须具备的优良体质和精神品质。在实践中，无数事例证明，经常坚持体育锻炼的人，体质增强了，疾病减少了，因而学习、工作、劳动效率大大提高了。如山东高唐县武花园村，因为坚持了体育运动，全村患病率由1951年的13.2％降到1957年的1.5％，劳动出勤率达90％以上，去年闹流行性感冒时，没有一个患病的。但离该村一里地的王花园村，就因感冒流行厉害，未完成播种任务。因此说体育运动能发挥人的最大的劳动能力和创造力，能促进社会生产力的迅速发展，还能增强国防力量。至于国防体育则不仅能增强体质，还能使人们学到初步的军事知识和技术，对增强国防力量就有着更重要的意义。
    体育运动开展的程度是经济和文化生活发展的反映，它又影响经济和文化生活的发展。经济和文化生活提高了，体育运动必定会得到迅速的开展，体育运动的开展，又进一步促进经济和文化生活的提高。
    经济生活提高了，人们就要求更丰富多采的文化生活。文化生活是上层建筑。它是经济基础的反映，又促进经济基础的发展，为经济基础服务。体育运动就是一种最引人兴趣的、有益的、健康的文化活动。现在有人说布票、油票、粮票都有了，就缺戏票和球票，可见人们对体育活动的兴趣。
    有人说，劳动一天累了，再作体育活动不是更增加人的疲劳么？这不对。刚才说过，劳动大多是身体局部的反复的活动和固定姿势的动作，而且劳动的分工越细，就越带有这种性质。因为由于劳动人的一部分肌肉和神经系统处于兴奋状态，而另一部分肌肉和神经系统就处于抑制状态。体育运动正可以使因劳动而处于抑制状态的那部分肌肉和神经处于兴奋状态，使因劳动而处于兴奋状态的那部分肌肉和神经处于抑制状态，得到休息。运动的动作和劳动不同，注意力也不同了。正是因为如此，运动是一种积极性的休息。能帮助人迅速地消除疲劳。
    体育运动是讲究竞赛的，竞赛是比高低，比胜负，比先进和落后的一种方法。而高低、胜负、先进、落后正是牵涉到集体和国家荣誉的一件大事。谁愿意在竞赛中失败呢？不敢胜利，不敢先进，甘于落后，甘拜下风是奴隶思想的一种表现，我国的社会主义事业，在各方面都正以飞跃的速度前进着。这是党的领导，人民得到解放，和社会主义制度的无比优越的证明。如果唯独体育运动在世界竞赛中落后，唯独体育运动不能表现社会主义制度的优越性，这当然是不应该的。体育运动也必须赶上去。事实证明，中国人民在党的领导下，不但能够在体育方面创造优秀成绩，还能够创造世界纪录。我们当然不能靠世界纪录吃饭，但能创造优秀成绩总是能引起人们的集体荣誉感的。集体荣誉感就绝不是一种坏东西。它鼓舞人们有敢于胜利，百尺竿头更进一步的上进心。这正符合于鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的原则精神。
    有人说，我们过去没有体育也过来了。是的，过去没有体育也行啦。但是今天就要有体育。今天是建设社会主义，对人的身体要求更高了。不能说过去没有，现在就也可以没有，要看它是否需要。我们祖先几千年犁地都是用人拉、牛拉或马拉，但我们现在要用拖拉机、机器拉；我们祖先几千年都是安步以当车，羽扇纶巾四轮车，可是我们现在要坐飞机、火车和汽车，过去我们的劳动人民没有体育，他们只要有碗饭吃就不错了，所以就说人生七十古来稀。现在我们是社会主义时代的人，不仅要改造社会，还要改造大自然，要在这一场紧张、热烈、持久的斗争中，坚持下来，而且还要不断地鼓干劲、争上游、多快好省地进行社会主义建设，这就必须要有德育、智育和体育，要教育人民成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的身体健康的劳动者。
    根据上述各点，我们认为体育是建设社会主义的积极因素，是社会主义建设事业中一项不可缺少的事业。所以根据党中央和毛主席的指示，要大力开展群众性的体育运动，在体育运动广泛开展的基础上，加速提高运动技术，争取十年左右在主要运动项目上赶上世界水平。这不仅是必需的，而且是可能的。
    要增强人民体质，使体育运动更好地为生产服务，要在体育竞赛中取得胜利，就必须使我国体育事业随着工农业生产大跃进，也来个大跃进。体育事业是一项群众性的事业，是关系着六亿人民的健康的事业，是关系着更好地建设社会主义的一件大事，也是关系着子孙万代的幸福的一件大事，所以必须全党支持这项事业，办这项事业。全体体育工作者，不待说，更要继续坚持不懈地努力，把自己的一切贡献给这项事业。
