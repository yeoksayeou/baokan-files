    City Tree Planting Should Be Planned
    Our Tianjin's greening work has achieved great results. Since this spring, tens of thousands of various trees have been planted. However, it is worth noting that some trees are planted in unsuitable places. Some are too close to walls or telephone poles; some places are not suitable for planting trees but they have been planted anyway, which will affect traffic. For example, on Shiqiangzi Street in Hedong District, the road is already very narrow, and now trees have been planted along the base of the walls on both sides, too close to the walls and too densely, making traffic very inconvenient. On the side road of Anshan Road west of Tianjin Affiliated Hospital, two rows of trees have been planted and they are very dense. In the future, when the trees grow up, people will not be able to walk on the side road. In some places, even small alleys have been planted with trees, which makes it inconvenient for pedestrians. I think the location for planting trees should be chosen appropriately, and it is best to have a unified plan, instead of planting them randomly.

    城市种树要有规划
    我们天津市的绿化工作有很大的成绩，今春以来，种植了数以万计的各种树类。但目前值得注意的是有一些树栽的地方不大适宜。有的是离墙、离电线杆太近；有的地方本来不宜栽树也栽上了，这样就会影响交通。如河东区石墙子大街，本来马路很窄，现在靠两边墙根都栽上了树，离墙又近又太密，交通很不方便。天津附属医院西边鞍山道的边道上，栽了两行树而且很密，将来树成长起来后，边道就不能走人了。还有的地方连小胡同也栽上了树，使行人不方便。我觉得栽树的地点应该选择得适当，而且最好能有统一规划，不要随便乱栽。
