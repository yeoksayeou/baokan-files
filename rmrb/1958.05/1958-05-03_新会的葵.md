    Xinhui's Palm
  　Lin Yingfa
    The palm is a famous Guangdong specialty known throughout the country, belonging to the palm family, and is an evergreen plant. When it grows up, some are as tall as ten feet, without a trunk; the leaves are very large, palm-shaped, each split, and all grow in clusters at the top of the stem. Only the leaves planted in Xinhui are particularly large and do not split, with a round and upright center, fine and even bones, and a smooth and clean color.
    Growing palm trees does not require a lot of farming labor, and Xinhui farmers generally regard it as a sideline crop. It grows extremely slowly; sow the palm seeds, and it takes three years to grow into palm seedlings, and then transplant them. The harvest volume of various palms varies, averaging about 3,500 palms per mu.
    The palm is the main economic crop of Xinhui County. Xinhui palm leaves have dense fibers, are waterproof, do not transmit heat, and are light in weight, and can be used to manufacture a wide variety of inexpensive and beautiful products. The palm leaves produced by each palm tree are made into various products from the handle to the leaf tip. The main use of the palm is to make various styles of palm fans; palm leaves and palm tips that cannot be made into fans can be made into rain capes, awnings, and palm bundles for covering sheds for farmers; palm bones can be made into various brooms, brushes, and toothpicks; the skin of the palm handle can be torn into rattan for making fans; the handle core can be made into cow ropes. These are all production and living supplies for farmers.
    During the first Five-Year Plan period, the total value of palm fans and palm products sold abroad by Xinhui County could be exchanged for more than 24 million jin of fertilizer. In order to adapt to the needs of production development, last year, Xinhui newly built a palm factory with an area of more than 5,100 square meters. (Attached picture)

    新会的葵
  　林英发
    葵是闻名全国的一种广东特产，属棕榈科，是常绿植物。长大时有的高及一丈，没有树干；叶很大，成掌状，每条裂开，都丛生在茎顶。独新会所植的叶特大而不开裂，心蒂圆正，骨格细匀，色泽光洁。
    种植葵树不需要很大的耕作力，新会农民普遍当作副作物。它生长极慢，播下葵米，三年长成葵苗，然后移植。各种葵的收获量不一，平均每亩约三千五百柄。
    葵是新会县主要的经济作物，新会葵叶纤维密，不透水、不传热、体量轻，可制造多种多样价廉物美的产品。每一株葵树所生产出来的葵叶，由柄到叶尾都分别制成各种产品。葵的主要用途是制各种式样的葵扇；不能制扇的葵叶和葵尾可制农民用的蓑衣、水贝、盖棚用的葵扎；葵骨可以制成各种扫帚、刷子和牙签；葵柄的皮可撕成合扇用的藤；柄心可制成牛绳。这些都是农民的生产和生活用品。
    在第一个五年计划期内，新会县运销国外的葵扇和葵制品的总值，可换进肥田料二千四百多万斤。为了适应生产发展的需要，去年，新会已新建了占地面积五千一百多平方公尺的葵厂。（附图片）
