    Work-Study Program at Northwestern Polytechnical University
    Liu Haibin, First Secretary of the Northwestern Polytechnical University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
    After the Shaanxi Provincial Committee decided to promote the experience of Xi'an First Aviation Technical School, all universities and secondary specialized schools in the province successively launched work-study programs to implement the policy of combining education with production and theory with practice. Currently, six more secondary vocational schools of engineering are expected to achieve full self-sufficiency this year. Universities and colleges have also generally made plans for implementing work-study programs. As for Northwestern Polytechnical University, as of April, more than 3,400 students in the school (excluding those on factory internships) generally participated in one to two weeks of labor, totaling more than 25,000 workdays. Each department and teaching and research group has formulated a production plan based on its own technical characteristics and equipment strength; it is estimated that the total output value this year can reach six million yuan. If the raw materials are guaranteed, it is very promising to achieve a large degree of self-sufficiency in school funding.
    Higher industrial schools have equipment, technology and labor force, which are favorable conditions for implementing work-study programs, but in the past, the utilization rate of school equipment and technical force was not high. Northwestern Polytechnical University has 394 sets of various machines and equipment, equivalent to a medium-sized machinery factory, while the utilization rate of professional equipment is generally only 15% to 30%. Even the most frequently used ordinary machine tools have a utilization rate of only 60%, and some high-precision machine tools have even been idle for two or three years without being used once. During the Two-Anti movement, these problems were exposed and debated, educating the masses and also educating the leaders. Therefore, as soon as the work-study policy was put forward, it immediately received enthusiastic support from the masses. Production targets were constantly broken by the soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses. Before the "Two-Anti", the school's production plan proposed the first account of 100,000 yuan, the second account of 150,000 yuan; at the beginning of the "Two-Anti", it jumped to 1.5 million yuan, and now it has leaped to 6 million yuan. After overcoming the conservative ideas of the leadership, it was immediately decided to simultaneously investigate, plan, arrange and produce; relying on the wisdom and strength of the masses, production was immediately started on a large scale. In order to support agricultural production, it is planned to produce 17 kinds of products such as diesel engines, gas engines, electric motors, and transformers this year, and 13 relevant teaching and research groups are organized to respectively undertake technical guidance and production plan management tasks. A diesel engine trial-manufacturing commando team composed of teachers and workers was also formed. Without drawings, models were made according to a disassembled diesel engine sample, and they worked day and night, finally completing the trial production task in less than a month. After the 502 teaching and research group proposed the initiative to independently design and manufacture aircraft, with the support of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee and relevant parties, preparations were immediately made. Teachers went to various places to understand the needs of production and transportation, collected data, and completed the preliminary sketch designs of seven aircraft of three types: air transport, agriculture and forestry, and multi-purpose, in two weeks of spare time. After discussion and evaluation, it was decided to adopt one of the agricultural and multi-purpose design schemes. At present, more detailed sketches, part drawings and aerodynamic designs have been completed, and model aerodynamic tests have begun. This initiative is aimed at serving the national economy, not only has its economic value, but also can effectively change the phenomenon of theory deviating from practice in the past, and is beneficial to improving teaching quality and developing scientific research. In addition to the design and manufacture of aircraft, which are arranged separately, it is estimated that about 1.2 million man-hours will be required to complete this year's production tasks. The school currently has 230 technicians, and can accommodate 400 more students to participate in labor every day. If each student works 30 workdays a year, all students in the school can be fully organized into production. It can be seen that higher industrial schools have great potential. If the production of higher industrial schools can be included in the national plan, and a certain production task is allocated every year, and assistance is provided in solving the problems of material supply, product sales, and technical cooperation, the potential of higher industrial schools can be fully realized. In this way, not only can the state spend less money and create wealth for the country, but more importantly, it can cultivate laborers with socialist consciousness and culture.
    At present, the great leap forward in agricultural production across the country and the blooming of local industries everywhere urgently need technical support, which is a great encouragement to teachers. Twenty-seven teachers at Northwestern Polytechnical University initiated a proposal to "contribute a plan per person" to support industrial and agricultural production. Many teachers used Sundays to go to the countryside and factories to participate in production labor and help solve technical problems in production. The school has initially established contacts between eight teaching and research groups and five agricultural cooperatives and twenty-seven factories and enterprises. Recently, Xi'an City has been assigned the task of undertaking the process design of three new factories and the renovation of several old factories and the trial production of new products. This year, Shaanxi Province plans to entrust the school to handle a fertilizer major, and instructed us to establish fixed contacts with the Shangluo area to assist in solving technical problems in establishing local industries. Teachers have a further understanding of the actual situation of industrial and agricultural production in these jobs, and feel that their labor is "linked to socialist production," and they are very happy. At the same time, they have further realized their shortcomings of being divorced from production practice, and generally feel that they must make up a lesson in production practice. Some old professors asked to be apprentices in factories, and many young teachers who used to be keen on leaving their posts for further studies and writing doctoral dissertations also asked to go to production practice to train themselves.
    After teachers and students came into contact with production labor, their mental outlook also underwent profound changes. Many people have received preliminary labor training, and began to appreciate the feelings of workers and peasants, and realize the arduousness and glory of labor. They said: "Look at the workers, compare yourself, and you will have the energy to work." However, there are also some people who have not yet figured out their thoughts. When they first participated in labor, they relied on a burst of enthusiasm. After being tired and returning to school, they said: "This time I have gained a lot, but I will never do it again!" In response to this situation, we launched a great debate on work-study based on the labor training of teachers and students. Mobilize the masses, starting from the discussion of work-study, to in-depth inspection of attitudes and views towards socialism, and repeatedly debated several rounds. In the debate, some people expressed doubts about the policy of combining education with production, believing that the task of higher industrial schools is to train engineers engaged in mental labor, and that education combined with production is "short-lived" and will not last long. Some people's bourgeois individualism is more serious, advocating "following the crowd in politics, and specializing in depth in business." Some people from the exploiting classes reflected a kind of gloomy mood, the old road does not work, and the new road is not accustomed to, and their hearts are "up and down" with heavy contradictions. A big-character poster wrote: "It is impossible to be both red and expert, dare not be only expert but not red, do not want to be only red but not expert, and unwilling to be neither red nor expert"; therefore "it is helpless to be expert but less red!" Because being divorced from labor and despising labor is the root cause of intellectuals' illness and the source of various wrong ideas, the debate on work-study can thoroughly and deeply expose and criticize various bourgeois ideas. Teachers and students are both nervous and happy to confide in the Party and "give gifts" to each other to carry out self-ideological revolution. They expressed their determination to thoroughly dig out their own root causes of illness and resolve to transform themselves in labor. As a professor said: "For thousands of years, education has been divorced from production labor, and intellectuals have taken the old road of 'studying well to become an official'. Now we must follow the path of combining education with production as indicated by the Party, and return to production labor."
    After the implementation of the work-study program, a series of new problems have also arisen in teaching: In the past, some teaching content was "thousands of miles away from New China and a hundred years away from the present"; the situation of teachers was "learning from books in the past, and teaching from books now"; the situation of students was "taking notes in class, comparing notes after class, memorizing notes for exams, and throwing away notes after exams." Teachers and students deeply realized that this situation must be changed, and realized that the implementation of combining education with production is the most effective way to further reform higher education. Many teachers advocate that the training objectives should adapt to the policy of combining "large, medium and small" in industrial construction, so that the graduated students can have the ability to engage in production independently without going through the process of becoming familiar with production; they can go to large factories or small factories; they can use their mouths or hands; in school, they are students who love labor, and after leaving school, they are laborers with culture. Therefore, teaching plans, teaching outlines, teaching methods, and teaching organization processes must have considerable changes. Recently, we have made preliminary discussions focusing on the major of mechanical manufacturing technology and equipment. Without extending the length of schooling and ensuring the quality of theoretical teaching, teachers proposed a teaching plan. Labor training is listed as one of the contents of assessing student performance, and a general evaluation is conducted every academic year. Since students have enriched their knowledge of production practice after participating in labor, the general and descriptive parts of the professional courses can be appropriately streamlined, and on-site teaching can be added in combination with the production process, or the method of summarizing production practice experience can be appropriately adopted. The graduation design can be combined with the needs of production practice inside and outside the school to improve the reality of the design. Each laboratory and the school's production factory are unified, and the laboratory is both a teaching place and a production workshop. These facts most vividly illustrate that the implementation of the work-study program will not only not affect the quality of teaching, but will greatly help to improve the quality of teaching.
    In short, after three months of practice, we have further realized that work-study is an important way to realize the combination of education and production, the combination of theory and practice, and the combination of mental and physical labor, and it is a key measure to promote the overall leap forward in school work. We must continue to adhere to it and improve it in the future, so that education work can better serve the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and serve to cultivate more talents who are both red and expert.

    勤工俭学在西北工大
    中共西北工业大学委员会第一书记　刘海滨
    陕西省委决定推广西安第一航空技工学校的经验以后，全省各高等学校和中等专业学校相继开展了勤工俭学活动，贯彻执行教育和生产、理论和实践相结合的方针。目前，又有六所工科中等专业学校可以在今年实现全部自给。高等学校也普遍作出了实行勤工俭学的规划。就西北工业大学来说，截至4月份，在校三千四百多学生（除下厂实习的以外），一般都进行了一周到二周的劳动，共做了二万五千多个劳动日。各系、各教研组都根据自己的技术特点、设备力量制定了生产规划；预计今年生产总值可达到六百万元。如果原材料有保证，做到学校经费大部自给，也是大有希望的。
    高等工业学校有设备、技术和劳动力，是实行勤工俭学的有利条件，但是在过去，学校设备和技术力量的利用率是不高的。西北工业大学有各种机器设备三百九十四台，相当于一个中型机械工厂，而专业设备的利用率一般只有15％到30％，利用率最高的普通机床也只有60％，有些精密度很高的机床甚至闲置了两三年没有用过一次。在双反运动中，这些问题得到揭发和辩论，教育了群众，也教育了领导。因而，勤工俭学的方针一提出，立即得到群众的热烈支持。生产指标不断被群众高涨的革命干劲所突破，“双反”前学校提出的生产计划第一本账为十万元，第二本账十五万元；双反初期一跃而为一百五十万元，现在跃进到六百万元。领导上的保守思想克服以后，随即决定边摸底，边规划，边安排，边生产；依靠群众的智慧和力量，立即动手，大搞生产。为了支援农业生产，计划今年生产柴油机、煤气机、电动机、变压器等十七种产品，组织有关的十三个教研组分别承担技术指导和生产计划管理的任务，并且由教师与工人组成柴油机试制突击队，没有图纸，便按照拆开的一部柴油机样品，制作模型，日夜突击工作，终于用不到一月时间完成试制任务。五○二教研组提出自行设计与制造飞机的倡议以后，在陕西省委及各有关方面的支持下，立即进行准备，教师分别到各地了解生产和航运上的需要，搜集资料，利用两周业余时间，完成了空运、农林、多用途三种类型七架飞机的初步草图设计。经过讨论评比，确定采用其中一架农业兼多用途的设计方案。目前已完成了较详细的草图、部位图及空气动力设计，并已开始作模型空气动力试验。这个倡议是以服务于国民经济为目的，不仅有它的经济价值，而且可以有效地改变过去理论脱离实际的现象，对于提高教学质量，开展科学研究，都有好处。除设计与制造飞机另有安排以外，估计要完成今年的生产任务，约需一百二十万个工时，学校现有技工二百三十人，每天还可容纳四百个学生参加劳动。每个学生一年做三十个劳动日，即可将全校学生完全组织到生产中来。可见高等工业学校潜力很大，如果能够将高等工业学校的生产纳入国家计划，每年分配一定的生产任务，协助解决材料供应、产品销售、技术协作等问题，使高等工业学校的潜力得到充分发挥。这样，不仅可以少花国家的钱并为国家创造财富，更重要的还是能够培养出有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者。
    目前全国农业生产大跃进，地方工业遍地开花，迫切需要技术的支援，这对教师的鼓舞很大。西北工业大学有二十七位教师发起为支援工农业生产“一人献一计”的倡议，许多教师利用星期日纷纷下乡下厂，一面参加生产劳动，一面帮助解决生产上的技术问题。全校已有八个教研组同五个农业社、二十七个工厂企业建立了初步联系。最近正给西安市承担三个新厂的工艺设计和几个老厂的改建与新产品试制的任务，今年陕西省计划委托学校代办一个肥料专业，并指示我们与商雒专区建立固定联系，协助解决兴办地方工业中的技术问题。教师在这些工作中，对工农业生产实际有了进一步的了解，感到自己的劳动与“社会主义生产挂了钩”，心里很高兴。同时也进一步认识了自己脱离生产实践的缺点，普遍感到必须在生产实践方面补一课。有的老教授要求到工厂当学徒，许多过去热中于脱产进修，写副博士论文的青年教师也纷纷要求到生产实践中去锻炼自己。
    教师、学生接触生产劳动以后，他们的精神面貌也起了深刻的变化。许多人受到了初步的劳动锻炼，开始体会到工人、农民的情感，认识到劳动的艰巨和光荣。他们说：“看看工人，比比自己，劳动起来就有了干劲。”但是，也有一些人思想还没有搞通，刚参加劳动时凭一股热情，受累回校以后，说什么：“这次收获很大，下次坚决不干！”我们针对这种情况，在教师学生经过一段劳动锻炼的基础上，开展了勤工俭学的大辩论。发动群众，从讨论勤工俭学着手，深入到检查对待社会主义的态度和看法，反复辩论几个回合。在辩论中一部分人对教育与生产相结合的方针表示怀疑，认为高等工业学校的任务是培养从事脑力劳动的工程师，教育结合生产是“短命鬼”搞不长。一部分人的资产阶级个人主义思想比较严重，主张“政治上随大流，业务上专深专透。”有些出身于剥削阶级的人，反映出一种灰溜溜的情绪，老路走不通，新的道路又不习惯，心里“七上八下”矛盾重重。有一张大字报这样写道：“又红又专不能，只专不红不敢，只红不专不干，不红不专不甘”；因此“大专少红无可奈何！”由于脱离劳动、轻视劳动是知识分子的病根子，是各种错误思想的根源，因而通过对勤工俭学的辩论，能够彻底地深刻地揭发和批判各种资产阶级思想。教师学生都是既紧张又愉快地向党交心，互相“送礼”，进行自我思想革命。他们纷纷表示要彻底挖掉自己的病根子，下决心在劳动中改造自己。正如一位教授所说：“千百年来的教育都是脱离生产劳动的，知识分子是走‘学而优则仕’的老路。现在我们必须遵循党所指示的教育结合生产的道路，回到生产劳动中去。”
    实行勤工俭学以后，在教学上也引起了一系列新的问题：过去有些教学内容是“距新中国千里，距现在百年”；教师的情况是“过去学书本，现在教书本”；学生的情况是“上课抄笔记，下课对笔记、考试背笔记、考完扔笔记。”教师学生深刻认识这种情况必须加以改变，认识到实行教育与生产相结合是进一步改革高等教育的最有效的方法。许多教师主张在培养目标方面应当适应工业建设上的“大、中、小”相结合的方针，使毕业出来的学生不需要经过熟悉生产的过程，就能具有独立从事生产的能力；能到大工厂，也能到小工厂；能动嘴，也能动手；在学校是热爱劳动的学生，出校后是有文化的劳动者。因之，教学计划、教学大纲、教学方法、教学组织过程都要有相当的改变。最近，我们以机械制造工艺及设备专业为重点，作了初步讨论。在不延长学制和保证理论教学质量的前提下，教师提出了一个教学计划方案。劳动锻炼列为考核学生成绩的内容之一，每学年进行总评。由于学生参加劳动以后，丰富了生产实践知识，专业课程中概论性和叙述性的部分内容，可以适当精简，还可以结合生产过程，增加现场教学，或者适当采取总结生产实践经验的方式进行。毕业设计可以结合校内外生产实际的需要，提高设计的现实性。各实验室与学校生产工厂统一起来，实验室既是教学场所，也是生产车间。这些事实最生动的说明，实行勤工俭学，不仅不会影响教学质量，相反地是大有助于提高教学质量的。
    总之，经过三个月以来的实践，我们进一步体会到勤工俭学是实现教育与生产结合、理论与实践结合、脑力劳动与体力劳动结合的一条重要途径，是促进学校工作全面跃进的一项关键性的措施。我们今后一定要继续坚持下去，并加以改进，使教育工作更好地为工农业生产大跃进服务，为培养出更多的又红又专的人才服务。
