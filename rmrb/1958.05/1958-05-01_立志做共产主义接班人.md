    Aspiring to Be a Successor to the Communist Cause
    Zhang Husheng, Student of Peking University
    The rectification movement has been going on for a full year. This year is a turning point in my entire life journey.
    In the past, in order to concentrate on studying my personal academic subjects, I thought it was enough to just go with the flow in politics. During the period of the rightists' attack, due to neglecting politics, I was not only misled by some rightist remarks, but also unconsciously said a lot of things that betrayed my position. After the struggle gradually deepened, I saw that almost all the rightists were extremely serious individualists. Looking at the rightists and thinking about myself, I couldn't help but feel a shock in my heart.
    After the anti-rightist struggle, following a general rectification, the Two-Anti movement was launched. I knew that I had serious individualism, but I dared not touch it, fearing that revealing the dirty things would cause me to lose face. However, when I saw hundreds of millions of people working selflessly for the great socialist cause, while I myself was circling around fame and fortune, how insignificant and shameful I was. So, I overcame my concern for face, laid out the problem, and asked everyone to help me criticize it.
    Overcoming individualism is indeed not an easy task and requires continuous struggle. I am determined to strive to become a red and expert working-class intellectual under the education of the Party. (Attached picture)

    立志做共产主义接班人
    北京大学学生　张虎生
    整风运动整整一年了。这一年，是我整个生活途程上的转折点。
    过去，为了集中精力钻研个人的学问，在政治上我以为只要随波逐流就可以了。在右派进攻的时期，由于忽视政治，我不但被一部分右派言论迷惑住，而且还不自觉地讲了不少丧失立场的话。在斗争逐步深入后，我看到几乎所有的右派都是极端严重的个人主义者。看右派，想自己，心里不禁震动了一下。
    反右之后经过一般整改，紧接着开展了双反运动。我知道自己有严重的个人主义，但不敢触碰它。怕抖露出脏东西来，面子上下不来。但是，当我眼看几亿人民都在为着伟大的社会主义事业而忘我劳动的时候，我自己却绕着名利打圈圈，是多么的渺小、可耻。于是，我克服了爱面子的思想，把问题摆开来，请大家帮忙批判。
    克服个人主义确实不是一件容易的事，还需要进行不断的斗争。我有决心在党的教育下，争取早日成为一个红透专深的工人阶级知识分子。（附图片）
