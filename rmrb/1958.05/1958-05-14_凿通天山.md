　　Tunneling Through the Tianshan Mountains
    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 13th. The key project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway – the Daban City Tianshan Tunnel Group project – has commenced ahead of schedule. More than two thousand railway construction workers have entered the Tianshan construction site, a region of overlapping and precipitous mountains. As of May 12th, the No. 2, No. 6, and No. 12 tunnels have been successively started.
    The Daban City Tunnel Group is a crucial engineering project for the train to pass through the Tianshan Mountains. A total of twelve tunnels, with a total length of 4.5 kilometers, will be built within ten kilometers of towering mountains, making the project extremely arduous. Because the rocks here are hard, the tunnels are densely packed, and the passage points are mostly located on the mountainside, the capacity for accommodating construction personnel and machinery is limited, and a large amount of equipment has to be moved up the mountainside, creating many difficulties in construction. However, the highly motivated railway construction workers have proposed to ensure that the Tianshan Mountains are tunneled through by next summer, striving to complete the railway to the border as soon as possible.

　　凿通天山
    新华社乌鲁木齐13日电　兰新铁路的关键工程——达坂城天山隧道群工程提前开工。两千多名铁路筑路工人已进入了峻岭重叠的天山工地。到12日为止，陆续开工的有二号、六号和十二号隧道。
    达坂城隧道群是火车通过天山的关键性工程，在十公里崇山峻岭间，共将打通十二条隧道，总长达四点五公里，工程非常艰巨。由于这里岩石质硬，隧道密集，通过地点多在半山腰，容纳施工人员和机械有限，大量器材要搬上半山，施工中有不少困难。但是干劲高昂的铁路筑路职工们提出，要保证在明年夏天打通天山，力争把铁路早日修到国境。
