　　Scientists' Great Leap Forward in Thought
　　Jin Wen
    When plant taxonomists were scattered and working individually, they could only consider how to "prepare conditions" for the huge task of compiling "Flora of China." After Liberation, they had been preparing for eight or nine years, and in the second Five-Year Plan, they only considered "preparing conditions." Some people thought that it would take about fifty or sixty years to complete this work, while others did not dare to imagine it at all. When socialist construction was leaping forward at a tremendous pace, comrades from industry, agriculture, health, commerce, and other departments came one after another and made requests to the plant taxonomists: supply a "Dendrology," supply a "Forage Flora," supply a "Medicinal Plant Flora," supply a "Flora of Wild Useful Plants"... This gave the plant taxonomists great encouragement and impetus. The situation was truly pressing!

    Now the news indicates that they have already broken away from this passive situation, and they will begin to publish "Flora of China" in a planned and gradual manner from next year to meet the needs of practical production. This is an exciting thing. China's plant taxonomists have already mustered revolutionary vigor, and this is a major achievement of the rectification campaign.

    In addition to directly serving practical production, the work of "Flora of China" is also of great significance for the development of the entire plant science, because it will provide basic data for genetics and breeding, geobotany, etc., and will help these disciplines to leap forward.

    The most fundamental reason why the plant taxonomists' work can leap forward is that they have criticized individualism and recognized the harm of working alone and emphasizing personal "interests" to the people's cause. They have realized that theory must be linked to practice, and they have consciously and voluntarily embarked on the road of collectivism. In this way, the difficulties in manpower and material resources that they originally thought were insurmountable can be overcome.

    The compilation of "Flora of China" is an arduous task. In addition to the active participation of plant taxonomists from scientific research units and universities across the country in the compilation work with one heart and one mind, it also requires the strong support of leading personnel from forestry, agriculture, health, commerce, and other departments at the central and local levels, as well as the relevant scientific and technical personnel in these departments to provide the greatest possible assistance in investigation, collection, provision of relevant data, and writing. The broad masses of peasants and other workers in agricultural, pastoral, and forest areas should also provide support, provide information on useful wild plants or make requests, so that this huge flora can meet the people as soon as possible.

    This leap forward by plant taxonomists also shows that similar work in the scientific community can also leap forward in the same way. We will see "Flora of China," and we believe that in the near future we will also see "Fauna of China," "Insect Fauna of China," "Mineral Resources of China," and so on, which are extremely needed for practical production.

　　科学家的思想大跃进
　　金文
    植物分类学家在分散单干的时候，对于编纂“中国植物志”这样巨大的任务，只能考虑如何“准备条件”。解放后已经准备了八、九年，第二个五年计划，他们也只考虑“准备条件”。有的人想，大约要五十、六十年才可以完成这项工作，有的人则根本不敢设想。当社会主义建设事业一日千里地跃进的时候，工业、农业、卫生、商业等部门的同志们接踵而来，纷纷向植物分类学家提出要求：供给“树木志”，供给“饲料志”，供给“药用植物志”，供给“野生有用植物志”……。给了植物分类学家们很大的鼓舞和鞭策，真是形势逼人！
    现在消息表明，他们已经从这种被动的形势中摆脱出来，他们将从明年开始有计划地陆续出版“中国植物志”，以满足生产实际的需要。这是令人兴奋的一件事。我国植物分类学家们已经鼓起了革命干劲，这是整风的重大成果。
    “中国植物志”这一工作，除了能直接为生产实际服务外，对整个植物科学的发展也有很大意义，因为它将对遗传育种、地植物学等提供基本资料，有助于这些学科的跃进。
    植物分类学家们的这项工作之所以能够跃进，最根本的原因在于他们批判了个人主义，认识到单干和强调个人“兴趣”对于人民事业的危害性。他们体会到理论必须联系实际，并自觉自愿地走上集体主义道路。这样一来，他们原来认为不可克服的人力、物力上的困难可以克服了。
    “中国植物志”的编纂是一件艰巨的工作，除了全国科学研究单位和高等学校的植物分类学家同心合力地积极参加编纂工作外，还需要中央和地方的林业、农业、卫生、商业等部门的领导人员大力支持，以及这些部门的有关科学技术工作人员在调查、采集、提供有关资料和编写方面尽最大可能予以支援。广大农区、牧区、林区的农民群众和其他工作人员，也应该予以支持，提供有关有用野生植物资料或提出要求，使这部巨大的植物志能早日同人们见面。
    植物分类学家们的这一跃进还说明，科学界类似的工作也可以同样地跃进。我们将看到“中国植物志”，相信在不久的将来也将看到生产实际极为需要的“中国动物志”、“中国昆虫志”、“中国矿产志”等等。
