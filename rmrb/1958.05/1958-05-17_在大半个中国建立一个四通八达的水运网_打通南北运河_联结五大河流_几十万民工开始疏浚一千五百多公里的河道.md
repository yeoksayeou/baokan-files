Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The massive project to open up the North-South Grand Canal has begun ahead of schedule. Hundreds of thousands of workers are now simultaneously working on three sections along the canal.

This great canal, comparable to the Great Wall, has been silted up for 103 years. Once the entire dredging project is completed, its golden age will truly begin. At that time, it will connect the Hai River, Yellow River, Huai River, Yangtze River, and Qiantang River systems, forming a vast water transport network where boats can travel to and from almost anywhere in China; one could travel by ship from Beijing directly to Hangzhou; and grain from Sichuan could be transported by water all the way to Beijing. Furthermore, since this canal runs parallel to the Jinpu Railway, it can share the railway's heavy transportation burden, effectively creating a second Jinpu Railway. The restoration and expansion of the Grand Canal is a project of immense scale. Plans include opening a new canal between Beijing and Tianjin, and deepening and widening the waterway between Tianjin and Hangzhou, enabling the passage of 2,000-ton motorized barges and fleets throughout the entire route. At the same time, some bends will be straightened, reducing the original length from over 1,700 kilometers to 1,583 kilometers, and the canal will be connected to the Qiantang River. The original plan was to expand the southern section of this canal during the Second Five-Year Plan period. However, due to its integration with water conservancy construction, the farmers' enthusiasm is extremely high, and with some Yellow River projects completed ahead of schedule, it may be possible to open the entire line ahead of schedule during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

The sections currently under construction are Jinan to Linjiaba, Linqing to Sinv Temple, and the Xuzhou section. Locks are being built in Suqian, Liubao near Yangliuqing, and Sinv Temple. Simultaneously, surveying and design are underway in areas between Beijing and Tianjin, Tianjin and Dezhou, and south of Xuzhou.

The North-South Grand Canal runs from Beijing to Hangzhou, passing through Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces. Originally, it was over 1,700 kilometers long. In 1855, the Yellow River breached its banks at Gangwaxiang in Henan and changed its course southward, causing the canal in Shandong to dry up, silt up, and become impassable. Since then, the entire Grand Canal has been fragmented: navigation between Beijing and Tianjin has ceased; a section of the canal in Hebei Province can only be navigated seasonally; navigation between Tianjin and Linqing relies on the water source of the Wei River; and the canal in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces can only accommodate small steamers and wooden sailboats.

This world-famous Grand Canal began construction in the 6th century BC during the Spring and Autumn period. Through the diligent labor of generations of working people, it was able to connect Beijing directly to Hangzhou by 1292 AD. Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty also extensively renovated it at great cost to the people when he traveled to Yangzhou. At that time, Emperor Yang rode a dragon boat that was 45 feet high and 200 feet long. Including the ships carrying the accompanying empresses, princes, princesses, officials, monks, nuns, Taoists, eunuchs, and palace maids, the fleet consisted of over 10,000 vessels. This grand fleet stretched for 200 li from beginning to end, illustrating the immense scale of the Grand Canal in those days.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th dispatch: The Grand Canal Committee, responsible for studying the overall plan of the Grand Canal and promoting its construction, has been established. Minister of Communications Wang Shoudao serves as the chairman, and Vice Minister of Water Resources and Electric Power Qian Zhengying and the vice governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Hebei provinces are also participating in the leadership.

The Grand Canal Engineering Administration and the Grand Canal Engineering Command Headquarters in relevant provinces have also been established. The task of these institutions is to lead the construction in sections, according to the principles of combining shipping engineering and water conservancy engineering, unified planning, contract responsibility by section, relying on the local areas, and relying on the masses.

### 在大半个中国建立一个四通八达的水运网　打通南北运河　联结五大河流　几十万民工开始疏浚一千五百多公里的河道

　　在大半个中国建立一个四通八达的水运网
　　打通南北运河　联结五大河流
　　几十万民工开始疏浚一千五百多公里的河道
    新华社16日讯　打通南北大运河的巨大工程已经提前开始了。现在有几十万民工在运河沿线的三个地段同时施工。
    这条同万里长城齐名的伟大运河已经淤塞了一百零三年。这次彻底疏浚河道的工程全部完工以后，将真正开始它的黄金时代。那时，它将把海河、黄河、淮河、长江、钱塘江五大水系联结起来，构成四通八达的水运网，大半个中国都可以互通舟楫；从北京坐轮船可以直达杭州；四川的粮食也可以由水路一直运到北京。又因为这条运河跟津浦铁路平行，将来可以分担津浦路过重的运输任务，等于修了第二条津浦路。大运河的恢复和扩建工程规模极大。计划在北京天津新开一条运河，天津到杭州间的河道挖深加宽，使全线畅通二千吨位的机动驳船和船队。同时还要把一部分湾道取直，把原来的一千七百多公里缩短为一千五百八十三公里，并且要接通钱塘江。这条运河原来计划在第二个五年计划期内扩建南段，现在因为结合水利建设，农民热情极高，加上黄河部分工程提前，所以有可能提前在第二个五年计划期内全线打通。
    现在正施工的地段有济宁到蔺家坝、临清到四女寺及徐州地段；正在修建船闸的地方，有宿迁、杨柳青附近的六堡、四女寺；同时进行测量设计的地段，有京津、津德（州）及徐州以南各地。
    南北大运河从北京到杭州，中间经过河北、山东、江苏、浙江四省，原长一千七百余公里，1855年，黄河在河南钢瓦箱决口改道南流，以致山东境内的运河缺水淤塞断航。以后大运河全线即支离破碎：北京天津间已不通航；河北省境内一段运河，只能季节性地通航，天津到临清间依靠卫河水源维持通航；在江苏和浙江境内的运河，也只能走小轮船和木帆船。
    这个世界著名的大运河，是从公元前六世纪春秋时代开始修凿的。经过历代劳动人民的辛勤劳动，到公元1292年便能从北京直通杭州。隋炀帝下扬州的时候，又曾劳民伤财地大修了一次。那时隋炀帝乘的是高四十五尺、长二百尺的龙舟，加上随行的那些后妃、诸王、公主、百官、僧尼、道士、太监、宫女乘坐的船舶，共达万艘以上。这个大船队浩浩荡荡首尾绵接达二百里，可以想见当年大运河规模之大。
    新华社16日讯　负责研究大运河总体规划和推动建设的大运河委员会已经成立，由交通部部长王首道担任主任委员；水利电力部副部长钱正英和江苏、浙江、山东、河北省的副省长都参加领导。
    大运河工程管理局和有关各省的大运河工程指挥部也都成立了。这些机构的任务是根据航运工程和水利工程相结合、统一规划、分段包干、依靠地方、依靠群众的方针，分段负责领导施工。
