    Preventing the Emergence of Third-Class Fields for Major Autumn Crops
    Jiangsu is Carrying Out a Summer Field Deep Plowing and Close Planting Movement
    (Our Newspaper News) Agricultural cooperatives in Jiangsu are prioritizing the elimination of third-class fields for autumn crops before sowing and transplanting, striving for high yields and bumper harvests on every mu for major autumn crops.
    In previous years, various crops in Jiangsu had a certain proportion of third-class fields with very low yields. There were many reasons for the formation of third-class fields. Some had poor soil, some had poor water conservancy conditions, and many third-class fields were caused by too little fertilizer, insufficient seed quantity, sparse planting with few seedlings, or delayed sowing, missing the farming season, etc.
    The Party committees at all levels in Jiangsu have learned from past experiences and lessons, and decided to do the work of eliminating third-class fields in advance. Currently, a technological innovation movement centered on deep plowing and close planting is being carried out in the rural areas of Jiangsu Province. The province's agricultural science and technology network, composed of hundreds of thousands of people, imparts various advanced technologies in summer planting to the broad masses of farmers through various forms. This year, the density of rice planting has generally increased from about 10,000 plants per mu in the past to more than 30,000 plants. The Suzhou area has launched a mass movement to reform plows, striving to achieve deep plowing on all summer planting fields this year. The Xuhuai area has launched a "10,000-jin sweet potato" competition, and has universally promoted warm bed seedling cultivation and various advanced technical measures. The base fertilizer applied to summer crops this year averages more than 400 dan per mu, which is higher than in any previous year. With the growth process of the crops, we will grasp every step and not miss any detail, and prevent the emergence of third-class fields.

    不让大秋作物出现三类田
    江苏正在开展夏田深耕密植运动
    本报讯　江苏各地农业社把消灭秋熟作物三类田的工作，放在播种、栽插之前，力争大秋作物样样高产、亩亩丰收。
    往年，江苏各地各项农作物都有一定比重产量很低的三类田。形成三类田的原因很多。有的是土壤不好，有些是因为水利条件不好，还有很多三类田是由于肥料太少、种量不足、稀植苗少，或是播种过迟、贻误农时等原因所造成的。
    江苏各级党委汲取过去的经验教训，决定把消灭三类田的工作做在前头。目前，一个以深耕密植为中心的技术革新运动正在江苏省农村开展。全省由百万人组成的农业科学技术网，通过各种形式向广大农民传授夏种中的各种先进技术。今年水稻普遍从过去的每亩一万棵左右提高到三万棵以上。苏州专区开展了改革耕犁的群众性运动，争取今年夏种田全部做到深耕。徐淮地区各地开展了“万斤山芋”竞赛，普遍推行了温床育苗及各项先进技术措施。今年夏种作物的基肥平均每亩达到四百多担，比以往任何一年都高。随着作物的生长过程，将一步不让，一着不漏地抓到底，不让三类田产生。
