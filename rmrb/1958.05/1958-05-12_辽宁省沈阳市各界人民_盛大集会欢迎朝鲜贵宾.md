Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 11th: Over 1,700 people from all walks of life in Liaoning Province and Shenyang City held a grand gathering at the Shenyang Cultural Palace Theater today to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China.

　　When delegation leader Xu Zhenshook, deputy leader Kim Chun-hae, and all the distinguished guests of the delegation, accompanied by Vice Minister of Internal Affairs Wang Yifu, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province Zhang Xuexuan, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Yu Ping, Chairman of the Liaoning Branch of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace Ning Wu, and Mayor of Shenyang Liu Baotian, entered the venue and ascended to the rostrum, the orchestra played welcoming music, and the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

　　Zhang Xuexuan, Vice Governor of Liaoning Province, delivered a welcoming speech first, extending a warm welcome and high respect on behalf of the people of the entire province to the distinguished guests from heroic Korea. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, established on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, has been tested in the long-term common struggle against aggression. During the days of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, nearly 100,000 workers, cadres, and technicians in Liaoning voluntarily took 7,000 carts directly to participate in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.

　　Zhang Xuexuan continued, according to the agreement between the Chinese and Korean governments, ten cities and counties in Liaoning Province received and resettled a total of 6,814 Korean war orphans. It is a great trust in the Chinese people that the Korean government was able to entrust the great task of nurturing the second generation to the Chinese people, and the people of the entire province feel deeply honored. These war orphans have grown up and are all very healthy. It is hoped that they will soon become a force in the construction army and be able to make a vigorous contribution to Korea's construction cause as soon as possible, and make contributions to their motherland.

　　Xu Zhenshook spoke amidst a storm of applause. She conveyed the warmest, friendly, and fraternal greetings of the Korean people to the people of Liaoning Province and Shenyang City. She said that the Chinese people not only sent their outstanding sons and daughters to the Korean battlefield to support the Korean people's struggle and strike at the vicious enemy, but also protected and nurtured the children of Korean patriotic martyrs and war orphans with the love of flesh and blood. The people of Liaoning Province have not only enabled more than 6,800 orphans to grow up healthily, but also done a lot of work to enable them to acquire advanced scientific and technological knowledge. The children who have grown up happily in the warm embrace of the Chinese people will soon return to their motherland, and they will become the core force in the various posts of peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction.

　　In her speech, Xu Zhenshook condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism in occupying southern Korea and China's Taiwan. She pointed out that the Korean people will surely drive away the American aggressors to reunify the motherland, and the Chinese people will surely liberate Taiwan. Victory belongs to the Chinese and Korean people. Leader Xu Zhenshook's 50-minute speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.

　　After Leader Xu Zhenshook's speech, she presented a banner to the Liaoning Provincial People's Committee. At this time, the entire audience stood up and applauded warmly.

　　After the welcoming meeting, the distinguished guests watched a wonderful acrobatic show.

　　The delegation visited the Northeast Industrial Exhibition Hall and Shenyang Cable Factory this afternoon.

    辽宁省沈阳市各界人民
　　盛大集会欢迎朝鲜贵宾
    新华社沈阳11日电　辽宁省、沈阳市各界人民一千七百多人今天在沈阳市文化宫剧场举行盛大集会，欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团。
    当许贞琡团长、金天海副团长和代表团全体贵宾，由内务部副部长王一夫、辽宁省副省长张雪轩、中共辽宁省委书记俞屏、中国人民保卫世界和平委员会辽宁省分会主席宁武和沈阳市市长刘宝田等人陪同进入会场走上主席台时，乐队高奏欢迎乐曲，全场起立热烈鼓掌。
    辽宁省副省长张雪轩首先致欢迎词，他代表全省人民向来自英雄朝鲜的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并致以崇高的敬意。他说，中朝两国人民在马克思列宁主义原则基础上建立起来的友谊，已经在长期反抗侵略的共同斗争中得到了考验。辽宁人民在抗美援朝斗争的日子里，曾有近十万民工、干部和技术人员，自愿地带着七千台大车直接参加了抗美援朝斗争。
    张雪轩接着说，根据中朝两国政府的协议，辽宁省十个市县共接收安置了六千八百一十四名朝鲜战灾孤儿。朝鲜政府能够把这项抚育第二代的伟大任务交给中国人民，是对中国人民的极大信任，全省人民深感光荣。这些战争孤儿们，已经长大成人，他们都很健康。希望他们很快地成为建设大军，能够尽快地对朝鲜建设事业作出有力的贡献，为他们的祖国立功。
    许贞琡在暴风雨般的鼓掌声中讲话。她向辽宁省和沈阳市全体人民转达了朝鲜人民最热烈的友好的兄弟的问候。她说，中国人民不仅派遣自己的优秀儿女到朝鲜战场，支援了朝鲜人民的斗争，打击了凶恶的敌人，并且又以亲骨肉般的爱，保护和抚育了朝鲜爱国烈士的子女和战灾孤儿。辽宁省人民不但使六千八百多名孤儿健康地成长起来，而且为了使他们获得了先进的科学技术知识作了很多工作。在中国人民温暖怀抱中幸福地成长起来的孩子们，不久就要回到自己的祖国去，他们在和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的各个岗位上，将会成为核心力量。
    许贞琡在讲话中谴责了美帝国主义占领朝鲜南部和中国台湾的罪行。她指出，朝鲜人民一定会赶走美国侵略者统一祖国，中国人民也一定要解放台湾，胜利是属于中朝人民的。许贞琡团长历时五十分钟的讲话，不时地被热烈的掌声所打断。
    许贞琡团长讲话后，向辽宁省人民委员会赠送一面锦旗。这时，全场起立热烈鼓掌。
    欢迎大会结束以后，贵宾们观看了精彩的杂技节目。
    代表团今天下午参观了东北工业陈列馆和沈阳电缆厂。
