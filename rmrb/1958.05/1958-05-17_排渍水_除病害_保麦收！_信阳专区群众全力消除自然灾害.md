　　Editor's Note: The wheat in Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, was originally growing very well, and a bumper harvest was just around the corner. However, in late April, it was hit by a sudden rainstorm, followed by continuous rain, which caused a large amount of wheat to lodge and yellow rust to spread widely. In some places, the wheat has already begun to die. Now, the masses in this prefecture are fighting with all their strength to eliminate waterlogging and diseases. This situation shows us that as long as the wheat is not harvested, the threat of various natural disasters will exist. We must not be negligent at this critical juncture. We must plan for the worst and prepare for various natural disasters as much as possible to be prepared for any eventuality.
　　This newspaper reports that the people of Xinyang Prefecture, Henan Province, are using their utmost strength to launch a courageous attack against wheat waterlogging, rust, and other disasters, concentrating all their efforts to fight this battle well and ensure a bumper wheat harvest.
　　After the later-stage management movement of wheat fields, including fertilization, weeding, watering, pest control, and recent drainage to prevent lodging, the wheat in this area is growing well. Most of it is full of milk, beans are round and the pods are full, and barley is nearing maturity, promising a bumper harvest. However, in the past twenty days, there has been continuous rain and wind, especially after a recent rainstorm. More than 1.5 million mu of first-class wheat have lodged, and more than 3.18 million mu of wheat have been infected with yellow rust. The mature barley is experiencing serious shattering, and the stalks and pods of the beans at the roots have rotted. In waterlogged wheat fields, some wheat roots have rotted, and some have begun to die. These natural disasters are seriously affecting the wheat harvest.
　　In order to overcome this natural disaster, on the afternoon of the 11th, Wang Dafu and Zhang Shufan, deputy secretaries of the Xinyang Prefectural Committee, and Lei Yujian, a member of the Prefectural Committee, braved the wind and rain to go deep into Zhongshan Township in Xinyang County and Pingqiao Township in Xinyang City to inspect the wheat disaster situation. They held a forum with veteran farmers on the spot to exchange experiences in drainage and rust prevention. That night, the Prefectural Committee took emergency measures to combat the disaster and save the wheat. Comrade Wang Dafu convened an emergency telephone conference of county party secretaries. He first pointed out that after the first rainstorm hit Xinyang Prefecture on the 23rd of last month, the people of the entire region waged a tenacious struggle against the sudden natural disaster and achieved great results. Most of the 700,000 mu of lodged wheat had been propped up, and most of the waterlogged wheat fields had been drained. Some townships and communes had drained water five times. However, from this struggle, two approaches and two results emerged. One was: to boost morale, strive for the upstream, go all out to fight natural disasters, and as a result, overcome the disasters and ensure a bumper harvest. The other was to retreat in the face of difficulties, admit defeat, bow to the disaster, and stand still, resulting in more severe damage and a tendency to reduce production. After the recent rainstorm in Zhongshan Commune, Xinyang, township and commune cadres led more than 240 people, dividing up the work, assigning specific areas to specific people, and draining water to save 1,165 mu of wheat in three days. However, the Xingfu Commune in the suburbs of Xinyang City acted slowly, resulting in losses. Two hundred and forty mu of the commune's 4,800 mu of wheat have already died from waterlogging. Therefore, the current struggle against natural disasters is a question of who overwhelms whom. If natural disasters overwhelm us, production will be reduced. If we overwhelm natural disasters, we can ensure a bumper harvest. Among the broad masses of cadres and people, we should immediately carry out a major debate on drainage, rust prevention, and other disaster-resistant and wheat-protecting measures, raise awareness, overcome complacency, right-leaning, and the mentality of waiting passively, boost morale, go all out, overcome natural disasters, and ensure a bumper harvest. All localities should convene forums with veteran farmers to summarize the effective local methods of the masses and immediately launch a mass movement to treat leaf rust. Finally, Comrade Wang Dafu emphasized that to win this battle, the secretaries must take the lead, the entire party must be mobilized, the entire people must take action, divide up the work, assign responsibilities, and establish a responsibility system. Immediately organize a massive force to fight against waterlogging, yellow rust, and other natural disasters, seize the harvest from natural disasters, and never stop until a complete victory is won.
　　Now, the people of all counties have entered the movement with a fighting spirit.

### 排渍水　除病害　保麦收！  信阳专区群众全力消除自然灾害

　　排渍水　除病害　保麦收！
　　信阳专区群众全力消除自然灾害
    编者按　河南信阳专区的小麦本来长得很好，丰收就在眼前，但是，4月下旬遭受了突如其来的一场暴风雨的袭击，其后又阴雨连绵，致使小麦大量倒伏，黄锈病大片蔓延，有的地方小麦已开始死亡。现在，这个专区的群众为消除涝灾和病害，正在全力进行斗争。这个情况向我们说明：小麦一天不收到手，各种自然灾害的威胁便一天存在，我们绝不能在这个紧要关头麻痹大意，必须从坏处打算，尽可能作好预防各种自然灾害的准备工作，做到有备无患。
    本报讯　河南省信阳专区人民正以回天之力，向小麦涝灾、锈病等灾害，开展勇猛的进攻，集中全力，打好这一仗，保证小麦丰收。
    这个地区在经过施肥、拔草、浇水、治虫和最近的排水防倒伏的麦田后期管理运动后，小麦生长良好，大部已灌满浆，豆类粒圆荚饱，大麦接近成熟，丰收在望。但是，近二十天来阴雨连绵，风雨交加，特别是经过近日来的一场暴风雨袭击之后，又有一百五十多万亩一类小麦倒伏，还有三百一十八万多亩小麦生了黄锈病，已成熟的大麦脱粒现象严重，豆类根部的秧秆和荚儿已腐烂，积水的麦田部分麦根已沤坏，有的已开始死亡。这些自然灾害，严重的影响着麦季的丰收。
    为了战胜这场自然灾害，11日下午，信阳地委副书记王达夫、张树藩，地委委员雷玉俭等冒着风雨，深入到信阳县中山乡和信阳市的平桥乡，检查了小麦受灾情况，就地召开了老农座谈会，交流了排水治锈病等经验。当天夜里，地委采取了抗灾救麦的紧急措施，并由王达夫同志召开了紧急的县委书记电话会议。他首先指出，上月23日信阳专区第一次遭受暴风雨的袭击之后，全区人民向突如其来的自然灾害作了顽强的斗争，取得了很大成绩。已倒伏的七十万亩小麦大部扶起，麦田积水大部排除，有些乡社已排了五次水。但是，从这段斗争中，出现了两种作法，两种结果。一是：鼓起干劲，力争上游，全力以赴，向自然灾害作斗争，结果战胜了灾害，保证了丰收。另一种是畏难而退，甘拜下风，向灾害低头，按兵不动，结果受害较重，有减产的趋势。信阳中山社在最近的暴风雨过后，乡社干部带动了二百四十多人，划片包干，定块到人，三天的时间，排水救麦一千一百六十五亩。而信阳市郊幸福社则行动迟缓造成损失。全社四千八百亩小麦，已淹死了二百四十亩。因此，眼前向自然灾害作斗争，是谁压倒谁的问题。自然灾害压倒了我们，就要减产，我们压倒了自然灾害，就能保丰收。在广大干部和群众中，应立即开展排水治锈病等抗灾保麦的大辩论，提高认识，克服麻痹右倾、消极等待情绪，鼓起干劲，全力以赴，战胜自然灾害，保证丰收。各地要召开老农座谈会，总结群众行之有效的土办法，立即开展群众性的治叶锈病运动。最后，王达夫同志强调指出，要打好这一仗，必须书记挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，划片包干，建立责任制。立即组织千军万马的队伍，向渍水、黄锈病等自然灾害作斗争，与自然灾害夺丰收，不获全胜，决不收兵。
    现在各县人民都以战斗的姿态投入了运动。
