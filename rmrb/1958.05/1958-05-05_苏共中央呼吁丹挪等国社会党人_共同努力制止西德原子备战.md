Xinhua News Agency, 4th. TASS reports that from the 2nd to the 4th, "Truth" published letters from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the leading bodies of the Danish Social Democratic Party, the Dutch Labour Party, the Norwegian Labour Party, and the Belgian Socialist Party, calling on them to take joint action to defend peace and international security, and to oppose the arming of the West German Federal Defence Force with atomic weapons. In these letters, the CPC Central Committee also requested the leading bodies of these parties to exchange views with the CPC Central Committee on issues related to safeguarding peace, opposing the threat of atomic war, and ensuring the security of the people of all countries.

The CPC Central Committee's letter to the Danish Social Democratic Party stated that just as the Soviet Union and peace-loving people in various countries are committed to consolidating peace and peaceful coexistence among nations, the aggressive blocs of the United States and other Western countries are continuing to pursue a policy that would lead to increased international tension and further arms expansion, as well as the preparation for atomic war.

The letter discussed the West German decision to arm the West German military with atomic weapons, stating that this decision is a clear violation of all current international agreements and is being carried out under the direct instructions of the aggressive blocs of the United States. The arming of the West German armed forces with nuclear weapons once again clearly demonstrates the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which West German revanchists can use at any time to drag all countries that have joined the organization into a destructive war, regardless of the will of the people of these countries. West German generals now want to command the Danish forces in the Jutland Peninsula and the Baltic Sea straits.

The letter stated that we are now calling on your party - the largest ruling party in Denmark - to use your influence to prevent the implementation of West Germany's decision to equip the Federal Defence Force with atomic weapons.

In its letter to the Dutch Labour Party, the CPC Central Committee also emphasized the threat posed to European peace by the decision to arm the West German Federal Defence Force with atomic weapons, pointing out the importance of the joint efforts of countries that have suffered from Hitler's aggression to stop the atomic arming of the West German military.

The letter pointed out that whether a universal cessation of nuclear testing can be achieved depends not only on countries possessing atomic weapons, but also, to a considerable extent, on the attitude and efforts of other peace-loving countries. Considering that the Dutch Labour Party has advocated a cessation of nuclear weapons testing, we are convinced that under current conditions it can make a significant contribution to the struggle for the cessation of such testing. We believe that your party will use its influence in parliament to take all possible measures to promote a comprehensive cessation of nuclear weapons testing and to stop the atomic and rocket arming of the West German military.

In its letter to the Norwegian Labour Party, the CPC Central Committee welcomed the statement by the Chairman of the Norwegian Labour Party and Prime Minister of Norway, Gerhardsen, refusing to deploy atomic and rocket weapons on Norwegian territory, as well as the statement made by the recent Nordic foreign ministers' meeting advocating a cessation of atomic weapons testing.

The CPC Central Committee called on the Norwegian Labour Party, as the ruling party of the country, to make further efforts to prevent the arming of the West German Federal Defence Force with atomic weapons, thereby promoting the consolidation of European peace.

In its letter to the Belgian Socialist Party, the CPC Central Committee stated that the decision to equip the West German military with atomic weapons deepens the danger of a third world war, will seriously hinder the smooth progress of negotiations on holding a high-level meeting to peacefully resolve important international issues, and will make the resolution of the German question more difficult. The atomic arming of the West German Federal Defence Force is a threat to Belgium's very survival. The CPC Central Committee hopes that the Belgian Socialist Party, as the ruling party, will give due consideration to the Soviet government's initiative to unilaterally cease nuclear weapons testing.

    苏共中央呼吁丹挪等国社会党人
    共同努力制止西德原子备战
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社报道，“真理报”2日到4日登载了苏联共产党中央委员会写给丹麦社会民主党、荷兰劳工党、挪威工党和比利时社会党领导机构的信，呼吁它们采取联合行动，来保卫和平和国际安全，反对用原子武器武装西德联邦国防军。苏共中央在这些信中还要求这些党的领导机构同苏共中央就有关保卫和平、反对原子战争威胁和保证各国人民安全问题交换意见。
    苏共中央给丹麦社会民主党的信说，正当苏联和各国爱好和平的公众致力于巩固和平和各国和平共处的时候，美国和西方其他国家的侵略集团却在继续执行一种会导致加剧国际紧张局势和进一步扩充军备以及准备原子战争的政策。
    信中谈到西德关于以原子武器武装西德军队的决定的时候说，这个决定是明显地违反了目前所有的国际协定，并且是按照美国的侵略集团的直接指示行事的。用核武器武装西德国防军再一次明显地表示出北大西洋公约组织的侵略性质，西德复仇主义者随时可以利用这个组织把所有加入这个组织的一切国家拖入毁灭性战争，而不考虑这些国家人民的意志。西德的将领现在就想指挥在日德兰半岛和波罗的海海峡的丹麦军队。
    信中说，现在我们呼吁你们党——丹麦最大的执政党，利用你们的影响，阻止西德关于用原子武器装备联邦国防军的决定的实现。
    苏共中央在给荷兰劳工党的信中也着重谈到以原子武器武装西德联邦国防军的决定对欧洲和平的威胁，指出受过希特勒侵略的国家共同努力制止西德军队进行原子武装的重要性。
    信中指出，普遍停止核试验是否能实现，不仅仅取决于拥有原子武器的国家，而且在不小的程度上也取决于其他爱好和平的国家的态度和努力。考虑到荷兰劳工党曾经主张停止核武器试验，我们深信，在目前条件下它能对争取停止这种试验的斗争作出巨大贡献。我们相信，你们党会运用自己在议会中的影响，尽其所能采取一切措施、力促全面停止试验核武器和制止西德军队的原子武装和火箭武装。
    苏共中央在写给挪威工党的信中对挪威工党主席、挪威首相基哈德森所发表的拒绝在挪威境内设置原子武器和火箭武器的声明以及最近举行的北欧国家外长会议主张停止试验原子武器的声明表示欢迎。
    苏共中央呼吁挪威工党作为国家的执政党，进一步努力阻止用原子武器武装西德联邦国防军，从而促进欧洲和平的巩固。
    苏共中央写信给比利时社会党说，以原子武器装备西德军队的决定使第三次世界大战的危险性加深，它将严重地妨碍顺利进行关于召开高级会议来和平解决重要的国际问题的谈判，并且使德国问题的解决更加困难。西德联邦国防军的原子武装是对比利时生存本身的威胁。苏共中央希望，作为执政党的比利时社会党对于苏联政府单方面停止核武器试验的倡议，给予应有的重视。
