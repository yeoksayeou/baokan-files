Guangdong Adopts Four Solutions to Address Shortage of Mechanical Equipment and High Demand
    (Our newspaper, Guangzhou, May 5th) Guangdong Province's relevant departments have taken measures to solve the problem of various regions competing to purchase machinery.
    Materials provided by relevant departments indicate that in the recent two to three months, due to the active development of local industries in various counties, townships, and communes across the province, and the construction of various machinery factories and processing plants, the demand for mechanical equipment such as generators, diesel engines, and various lathes has greatly increased. For example, the province needs more than 20,000 electric motors this year, while commercial departments can only supply 10,000. To purchase these machines, various counties have sent people to Guangzhou and other provinces to compete for them. Currently, there are more than 1,000 purchasing personnel in Guangzhou alone. Some purchasing personnel are competing to buy small machines manufactured by individual handicraftsmen at high prices, creating market chaos. At the same time, some purchasing personnel are blindly flowing to other provinces, resulting in a waste of manpower and financial resources.
    In response to the above situation, the Provincial Planning Commission and the Department of Commerce and other relevant departments held a meeting to study solutions. First, organize production departments to actively increase production, help small and medium-sized cities actively trial-produce and produce various machinery and equipment, and give full play to their potential. Second, commercial departments will uniformly purchase small machines manufactured by individual handicraftsmen. Third, commercial departments will go to other provinces to understand the situation and purchase. Fourth, all types of lathes and power machinery produced in the province will be uniformly managed by the provincial commercial departments, and rationally distributed according to the needs and priorities of various regions. The Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Mechanical and Electrical Industry has also arranged production tasks for various engineering colleges in the city to give play to the effectiveness of these colleges' lathes and power machinery.

    机械设备来源少要的多
    广东采取四项解决办法
    本报广州5日电　广东省有关部门采取措施，解决各地争购机械的问题。
    有关部门提供的材料说明，最近二、三个月来，由于全省各县、乡、社都在积极发展地方工业，兴建各种机械厂和加工厂等，需要的发电机、柴油机和各式车床等机械设备大大增加。例如今年全省需要电动机二万多台，而商业部门仅能供应一万台。为了购买这些机械，各县纷纷派人到广州和其他省市去争购。目前，仅在广州市采购的人员就达一千多人。有些采购人员高价争购个体手工业者制造的小型机器，造成市场混乱；同时，又有一部分采购人员盲目流向其他省市，造成人力财力的浪费。
    针对上述情况，省计委和商业厅等有关部门开会研究了解决的办法。一、组织生产部门积极增加生产，帮助中小城市积极试制和生产各种机器设备，充分发挥它们的潜力。二、由商业部门统一收购个体手工业者制造的小型机器。三、由商业部门到外省了解情况和采购。四、全省所生产的各式车床和动力机械，由省商业部门统一管理，按照各地需要和轻重缓急进行合理分配。广州市机电工业局还给全市各工科院校安排了生产任务，发挥这些院校的车床和动力机械的效用。
