Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: TASS reports from Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed a statement from the Soviet government to the Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Stefano, on May 20th, for transmission to the Italian government. In this statement, the Soviet government suggested negotiations with Italy on the issue of concluding a treaty of friendship and non-aggression between the Soviet Union and Italy.

The Soviet government's statement pointed out that previous exchanges of views between the two governments on individual issues in their bilateral relations had not yielded good results. However, the Soviet government firmly believes that it is necessary to utilize existing practical possibilities, seek ways to reach mutually beneficial agreements, and lay the foundation for genuinely friendly relations between the Italian and Soviet peoples.

The Soviet government believes that the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and non-aggression between Italy and the Soviet Union would help achieve this goal. The statement pointed out that the treaty could stipulate that the two countries, in the spirit of sincere cooperation and mutual understanding, will develop and strengthen friendly relations between the Soviet and Italian peoples based on the principles of peaceful coexistence, including mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality, and mutual benefit.

The statement emphasized that the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and non-aggression on a mutually beneficial basis would be a turning point in Soviet-Italian relations. It would be in line with the peace-loving aspirations of the two peoples and would have a positive impact on the overall improvement of the international situation.

The statement also mentioned that the conclusion of this treaty would create favorable conditions for resolving the issue of Italy's post-war reparations to the Soviet Union, enabling an agreement to be reached on a basis acceptable to both parties. The Soviet government also expressed its willingness to consider Italy's wishes to amend the preamble, political, and military clauses of the post-war treaty.

    新华社22日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在20日把苏联政府致意大利政府的一项声明交给意大利驻苏联大使斯蒂芬诺转交意大利政府。苏联政府在这项声明中建议同意大利就缔结苏意两国友好和互不侵犯条约的问题进行谈判。
    苏联政府的声明指出，在这以前，两国政府就两国关系中的个别问题交换意见没有得到良好的结果，然而苏联政府深信，必须利用现有的实际的可能性，寻求达成互利的协议的途径，并为意苏两国之间的真正友好关系奠定基础。
    苏联政府认为，意大利和苏联缔结友好和互不侵犯条约将有助于达到这种目的。声明指出，在条约中可以规定，两国将本着真诚合作与相互谅解的精神，根据互相尊重领土完整和主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利这些和平共处的原则，发展和加强苏意两国人民之间的友好关系。
    声明强调指出，在互利基础上缔结友好和互不侵犯条约将是苏意两国关系中的转折点，它将符合两国人民爱好和平的愿望，并且对普遍改善国际局势会产生积极的影响。
    声明还谈到，缔结这一条约将为解决意大利对苏联的战后赔款问题创造良好条件，使这一问题也能在双方都能接受的基础上取得协议。苏联政府还表示愿意考虑意大利方面关于修改战后和约的序言和政治、军事条款的愿望。
