    “Gains and Experiences of Cadres Sent to Lower Levels for Labor Training”
    “Gains and Experiences of Cadres Sent to Lower Levels for Labor Training” is a collection of articles written by hundreds of teachers and cadres from the People's University of China who, after several months of labor training in the countryside, have initially achieved some results. They have written about their personal experiences, which have been published as a separate booklet by the People's University of China Press.
    This booklet was written based on practical work, so it is written in a relatively vivid and concrete manner. The book provides a relatively comprehensive explanation of some of the main aspects of labor training for cadres sent to lower levels, namely, productive labor, ideological remolding, and mass work. It also puts forward some useful opinions on how to strengthen and improve the leadership and management of cadres sent to lower levels. However, because they have not participated in labor for a long time, the book lacks due reflection on how cadres sent to lower levels can leap forward in the great leap forward in agriculture, and how to achieve both redness and expertise, which are issues of concern to everyone. It is hoped that more such books will be published in the future.

    “下放干部劳动锻炼的收获和体会”
    “下放干部劳动锻炼的收获和体会”是中国人民大学下放到农村的数百名教师和干部，经过几个月的劳动锻炼，已初步取得了一些成绩。他们把自己的亲身体验写成文章，由中国人民大学出版社印成单行本出版。
    这本小册子是在实际工作中写出的，因而写得比较生动和具体。书中对于下放干部劳动锻炼的一些主要方面，即生产劳动、思想改造和群众工作等，都作了较为全面的说明。对于如何加强和改善下放干部的领导和管理的工作等问题，也提出了一些有益的意见。但是，由于他们参加劳动的时间还不长，所以关于在农业大跃进中下放干部如何跃进、如何做到红透专深等问题，书中缺乏应有的反映，而这些问题都是大家所关心的。希望今后有更多这样的书籍出版。
