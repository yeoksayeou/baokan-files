Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 4th. Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, emphasized on the 2nd that agricultural production cooperatives in East Germany have convincingly demonstrated their superiority in the past six months.

Ulbricht made these remarks at a meeting of the Advisory Committee of Agricultural Production Cooperatives held near Leipzig.

Ulbricht said that currently, it is not only individual agricultural production cooperatives that are playing a demonstrative role, but the majority of agricultural production cooperatives are exceeding private farms in terms of output and labor productivity. He pointed out that agricultural production cooperatives must be further encouraged in order to improve the food supply situation for the people.

According to figures released by the East German government in April, there are currently 7,336 agricultural production cooperatives nationwide (6,281 at the end of 1956), with cultivated land accounting for approximately 28% of the total cultivated land in East Germany.

    合作比单干多打粮
    民主德国农业社显示优越性
    新华社4日讯　柏林消息：德国统一社会党中央第一书记乌布利希2日强调指出，过去六个月里，民主德国的农业生产合作社令人信服地证明了它们的优越性。
    乌布利希是在来比锡近郊举行的农业生产合作社咨询委员会会议上讲这番话的。
    乌布利希说，目前已经不仅是个别农业生产合作社在起示范作用，而是大多数农业生产合作社在产量和劳动生产率方面都超过了私营农场。他指出，必须进一步对农业生产合作社给予鼓励，以便改进对人民的食品供应状况。
    据民主德国政府4月份公布的数字，目前全国共有农业生产合作社七千三百三十六个（1956年底是六千二百八十一个），耕地面积占民主德国总耕地面积的28％左右。
