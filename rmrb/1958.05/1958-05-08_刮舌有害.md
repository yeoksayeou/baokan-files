Why?

    Scraping the Tongue is Harmful

    Brushing your teeth in the morning and evening, and rinsing your mouth after meals are good habits for protecting your teeth and maintaining oral hygiene. However, some people also have the habit of scraping their tongues, which is harmful to their health.

    The surface of the tongue has delicate papillae, which are nerve ending devices that allow people to taste the various flavors of food. Scraping the tongue can damage the papillae, and long-term scraping can cause the papillae to atrophy. The taste function will weaken, and the appetite will decrease accordingly. Long-term stimulation from instruments can even lead to "tongue cancer."

    Someone once did an experiment: a rabbit was scraped once a day, and in less than a week, the rabbit died because of loss of appetite and lack of appetite. (Guang Yi)

    刮舌有害
    早晚刷牙，饭后漱口，是保护牙齿、保持口腔卫生的好习惯。但是有些人同时有刮舌的习惯，这对身体健康是有害处的。
    舌头的表面有着纤弱的乳头，这是人们所以能够品尝出食物的各样味道的神经末端装置。刮舌会损伤乳头，长期地刮更会使乳头萎缩，司味的机能就要变弱，食欲也就随着减低。甚至因器械的长期刺激，还有生“舌癌”的可能。
    曾有人做过这样的实验：给一只兔子每日刮舌一次，不到一星期，这只兔子因食欲消退、不思饮食就死去了。　（广义）
