　　A Review of the Kerala Government's First Year
    Kong Mai

    April 5th marked the first anniversary of the establishment of the Kerala government led by the Communist Party of India.

    The Kerala government, led by the Communist Party, came to power after the second general election in India. In that election, the Communist Party won sixty seats out of the one hundred and twenty-seven seats in the State Legislative Assembly. With the support of elected independents, the Communist Party of Kerala secured a majority in the State Legislative Assembly. The Kerala government operates in accordance with the Indian Constitution.

    In the year since taking office, the State Government has taken many measures in all aspects of people's lives, the most important of which are the formulation of land reform bills and the implementation of reforms in education and administration, and has made efforts to establish a new policy for labor-management relations.

    Admittedly, most of the State Government's important measures have aroused fierce debate within the State. However, even Congress Party leaders such as Gadgil, vice chairman of the State Bank of India, admit that the Kerala government's "reputation is growing day by day." A recent editorial in the "Indian Express" stated: "Namboodiripad's public performance is impeccable." Malaviya, former editor of the "Economic Review" of the Congress National Committee, said: "The Kerala government is a clean government, and this fact is indisputable, even its fiercest enemies must admit it."

    The influence of the Kerala Communist Government extends throughout India. For the Indian working masses, it plays an inspiring role, making them feel proud. The Legislative Assemblies of other states often mention the work of the Kerala government, asking their respective state governments to compete with the Kerala government in some of its excellent work. Kerala is the only state with a budget surplus. When President Prasad visited Kerala in the spring of 1957, he also praised the Kerala government's "good service."

    The Kerala government's reputation was earned by the passionate and selfless work of the State Government ministers. Before India gained independence, the Congress Party passed a resolution stipulating that the salaries of Congress Party ministers should not exceed 500 rupees per month. However, after independence, the salaries of Congress Party ministers greatly exceeded this amount. The Communist Party ministers of Kerala were the first to implement the method of not exceeding 500 rupees per month. In fact, their monthly salaries were far less than 500 rupees. The Kerala ministers were the first to abolish the pomp and circumstance that State Government ministers had always emphasized. The impact of these decisions was far-reaching. On the initiative of Prime Minister Nehru, the ministers of the Central Government and the State Governments decided to voluntarily reduce their salaries by 10%. Prime Minister Nehru also advised the Congress Party ministers of the State Governments to abandon pomp and circumstance.

    In terms of land reform, Kerala can be proud. After the State Government took office, it immediately promulgated a decree prohibiting the recovery of tenant farmers' land. Subsequently, the State Government decided to distribute state-owned land to landless farmers through people's committees. The State Government also determined the minimum wages for agricultural workers and proposed other bills, such as: the Farmers' Debt Relief Bill, the Abolition of the Jammikaram System (a landlord system) Bill, the Lender Control Bill, and the Kerala Land Relations Bill. In the words of Chief Minister Namboodiripad himself: "Kerala is the first state in India to implement the recommendations made by the Congress Party Land Reform Committee and the Land Reform Committee affiliated to the Planning Commission throughout the entire state." Namboodiripad said that all these measures "aim to help the vast poor masses in rural areas break free from the shackles of exploiters and stand up."

    Kerala is a state that cannot be self-sufficient in food, and half of the state's food each year must be transported in from outside the state and subsidized by the central government. Therefore, solving the food problem is an arduous task for the State Government. Since its establishment, the Kerala government has attached great importance to the food issue. The State Government is trying to solve this problem from three aspects. First, in order to fundamentally and in the long term solve the food problem, the State Government has successively formulated a series of decrees and bills beneficial to farmers as mentioned above after taking office; second, concrete measures and plans are taken to increase food production, such as improving seeds, adopting Japanese farming methods, increasing chemical fertilizers and green manure, digging wells, distributing insecticides, and encouraging farmers and cooperatives to build small-scale water conservancy projects, while the State Government is responsible for building larger water conservancy projects; third, setting up parity-price grain stores and grain depots at all levels throughout the state, while organizing food consultation committees and supervision committees in counties and districts, and fully mobilizing the forces of various parties and people's organizations to prevent food speculation. As a result, the food situation in Kerala in the past year has been more stable than in previous years.

    The characteristic of the Kerala government's labor policy is that the State Government is constantly striving to use labor-management consultation and acceptance of workers' legitimate demands as a means of resolving disputes. In the first ten months of taking office, the State Government handled 4,157 labor disputes, of which 3,780 were resolved through tripartite consultation. At the same time, the State Government first ordered an increase in the wages of workers in state-owned enterprises, and stipulated the minimum wages in various industrial enterprises.

    In terms of education, the State Government has taken measures to implement compulsory education for all children under the age of fourteen, providing free lunch porridge for children in primary schools in three counties, and decided to newly establish a medical college, an engineering college, and several technical schools. The State Government has decided to implement compulsory education for children throughout the state within five years. The State Legislative Assembly passed the Education Reform Bill last year with the aim of reforming education. This bill has been opposed by the Catholic Church. Most of the private schools in Kerala are run by the Catholic Church. The President of India has submitted the bill to the Supreme Court to seek the Supreme Court's opinion on several controversial clauses in the bill. The State Legislative Assembly also passed the Kerala University Bill, which reforms university education.

    The Kerala government has established an administrative reform committee for the purpose of studying and improving administrative institutions. The current administrative institutions were established by the past British rulers and feudal rulers. Its inefficiency and rampant corruption have been criticized by public opinion. The State Government has established people's consultation committees representing all aspects of opinion as a transitional measure, such as: the State Planning Bureau, county development committees, river basin bureaus, subcommittees affiliated to public utilities departments, and so on.

    Kerala is the most densely populated state in India. Its resources are abundant, but the average income of a family in Kerala is perhaps the least among the states in India. The land in Kerala is not enough to provide a livelihood for the large number of unemployed people in the state. Since taking office, the State Government has been committed to planning for the establishment and development of new industries in the state. The State Government provided financial assistance to sixty-three existing industrial enterprises; at the same time, in order to develop small-scale industries, it assisted in the establishment of six industrial cooperatives. The State Government has allocated public land in Trivandrum to build a textile factory. According to press reports, the famous industrialist Birla has agreed to build a rayon pulp factory in Kerala. The State Government has also taken measures to develop Kerala's water conservancy. The State Government's huge plan to develop the irrigation, hydropower, shipping and other potentials of the state's twenty-six rivers is nearing completion. Three new major irrigation projects have been included in the Second Five-Year Plan.

    In terms of social reform, the State Government has also made efforts and promulgated some bills, such as the Prohibition of Dowry Bill and the Kerala Maternity Benefit Bill. In order to prevent the indiscriminate felling of trees, the State Legislative Assembly also passed the Private Forest Management Bill, which authorizes the government to take over private forests connected to more than 100 acres.

    The Kerala government has also faced great difficulties. For ten years, Kerala has never had a stable government. After the establishment of the Communist Party-led Kerala government, all the opposition parties in the state: the Congress Party, the People's Socialist Party, and the Muslim League united to oppose the State Government. They carried out activities against the Education Bill and launched incidents of illegally occupying government land. Recently, they are brewing opposition to the Land Relations Bill. The opposition complains that Kerala has no law and no order. They attempted to bribe Communist Party members of the State Legislative Assembly. Not long ago, someone bribed a Communist Party member with a large sum of money to vote against the State Government in the Legislative Assembly, and this conspiracy was exposed.

    Prime Minister Nehru, Congress Party Chairman Debar, and other Congress Party leaders will visit Kerala separately within a few months starting in April. It is said that the next annual meeting of the Congress Party will be held in Kerala.

    Despite these oppositions, as Namboodiripad said in an article published in the latest issue of "New Century" weekly: "The first year of the Communist government has begun to break down the barriers between the Communist Party and the vast masses of people belonging to other parties. Those parties and the Communist Party share the same national goal: to build a socialist India." He said that the work of Kerala this year has effectively shattered the anti-communist argument that Communist Party rule means the loss of national traditions and all good things in moral values.

    Namboodiripad also said that the Kerala government has been working hard to promote socio-economic changes in a peaceful manner. He pointed out that "the achievements of the past year are sufficient to prove our remarkably effective efforts in this regard." "If we can serve a full five-year term, we will be able to prove that the changes in the socio-economic system that we have promoted in Kerala will exceed those of any other state in India."

　　喀拉拉邦政府一年来的回顾
    孔迈
    4月5日是印度共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府成立一周年纪念日。
    共产党领导下的喀拉拉邦政府是在印度第二次大选以后执政的。在那次大选里，共产党在邦立法议会的一百二十七个议席中获得了六十个议席。在当选的独立人士的支持下，喀拉拉邦共产党获得了邦立法议会中的多数。喀拉拉邦政府根据印度宪法进行工作。
    执政一年以来，邦政府在人民生活各方面采取了许多措施，其中最重要的如制订土地改革法案和实行教育及行政方面的改革，并为确立劳资关系的新政策而作了努力。
    诚然，邦政府大部分的重要措施引起了邦内激烈的争论。可是，连印度国家银行副主席加德吉尔这样身份的国大党领袖都承认，喀拉拉邦政府“声誉日隆”。“印度快报”最近的一篇社论说：“南布迪里巴德的公开表现是无瑕可指的。”国大党全国委员会的“经济评论”前编辑马拉维亚说：“喀拉拉邦政府是一个廉洁的政府，这个事实是无可争辩的，连最凶的敌人也不得不承认。”
    喀拉拉邦共产党政府的影响远及印度全国。这对印度工人群众说来，起着一种振奋人心的作用，使印度工人群众感到自豪。其他各邦的立法议会时常提到喀拉拉邦政府的工作，要求各该邦邦政府在喀拉拉邦政府的若干优秀工作方面与喀拉拉邦政府进行竞赛。喀拉拉邦是唯一的预算有结余的一个邦。1957年春季，普拉沙德总统访问喀拉拉邦的时候，也称赞了喀拉拉邦政府的“良好的服务”。
    喀拉拉邦政府的声誉是由邦政府部长们的热情忘我的工作赢得的。印度获得独立以前，国大党曾经通过一项决议，规定国大党的部长们的薪金每月不超过五百卢比。但是独立以后，国大党的部长们的薪金大大地超过了这个数目。喀拉拉邦共产党的部长们首先实行了每月薪金不超过五百卢比的办法。事实上他们每月的薪金远不及五百卢比。喀拉拉邦部长们首先废止了邦政府部长们向来讲究的排场。这些决定的影响是很深远的。在尼赫鲁总理的倡议下，中央政府与邦政府的部长们决定自动减薪10％。尼赫鲁总理也劝告邦政府的国大党部长们放弃排场。
    在土地改革方面，喀拉拉邦是足以自豪的。邦政府执政以后，立即公布法令禁止收回佃户的土地。接着，邦政府决定通过人民的委员会把邦有土地分配给无地的农民。邦政府又决定了农业工人最低的工资，并提出一些别的法案，例如：农民债务救济法案、废除詹米卡拉姆制度（一种地主制度）法案、放贷者管制法案、喀拉拉土地关系法案。用首席部长南布迪里巴德自己的话来说：“在印度，首先在一个邦全邦范围内实行国大党土地改革委员会与计划委员会所属土地改革委员会所提出的建议的，就是喀拉拉邦。”南布迪里巴德说，所有这些措施，“其目的在于协助农村的广大贫苦群众摆脱剥削者的束缚而站立起来。”
    喀拉拉邦是粮食不能自给的一个邦，每年邦内的粮食有一半须靠邦外运入和中央补助。因此，解决粮食问题是邦政府的一项艰巨的任务。喀拉拉邦政府自成立以来即对粮食问题给予极大的重视。邦政府是从三方面来设法解决这问题的。第一，为了从根本和长远方面解决粮食问题，邦政府执政后即陆续制定了上面所说的对农民有利的一系列法令和法案；第二，采取具体措施和计划来增产粮食，如改良种籽，采用日本的耕作法，增加化学肥料和绿肥，打井，发放杀虫药剂，并鼓励农民和合作社兴修小型水利工程，邦政府则担负修建较大的水利工程；第三，在邦内普遍设立平价粮店和各级粮仓，同时并组织县和区的粮食谘询委员会和纠察委员会，充分发动各党派和人民团体的力量，以防止粮食投机情况。结果，喀拉拉邦一年来的粮食情况比以前几年都更平稳。
    喀拉拉邦政府的劳工政策的特点是，邦政府不断努力以劳资协商、接受工人合法要求为解决争端的手段。邦政府在执政的最初十个月内，处理了四千一百五十七件劳资纠纷案，其中三千七百八十件是通过三方面协商解决的。同时，邦政府首先命令增加邦营企业工人的工资，并且规定了各种工业企业中最低的工资。
    在教育方面，邦政府采取措施对所有十四岁以下的儿童实行义务教育，在三个县的小学校内免费供应儿童的午餐粥，并决定新设医学院一所、工学院一所、技术专科学校若干所。邦政府决定在五年以内，在全邦范围内实施儿童义务教育。邦立法议会于去年通过了以改革教育为目的的教育改革法案。这项法案遭受了天主教教会的反对。喀拉拉邦大多数的私立学校都是天主教教会开办的。印度总统已经把该法案提交最高法院，征求最高法院对法案中引起争执的若干条款表示意见。邦立法议会还通过了一项对大学教育进行改革的喀拉拉大学法案。
    喀拉拉邦政府设立了以研究改善行政机构为目的的行政改革委员会。现行的行政机构是由过去的英国统治者与封建统治者设立的。它的效率低下，贪污盛行，一直受到舆论的责难。邦政府设立了代表各方面意见的、人民的谘询委员会作为一种过渡的措施，例如：邦设计局，县发展委员会，江河流域局，公共事业部附属小组委员会等等。
    喀拉拉邦是印度人口最稠密的一邦。它的资源丰富，但是喀拉拉邦一个家庭的平均收入，在印度各邦中也许是最少的。喀拉拉邦的土地不足以提供邦内大量失业人民的生计。邦政府从执政时期起，致力于在邦内创办与发展新工业的计划。邦政府对六十三个现有的工业企业进行了财政援助；同时为了发展小规模工业，协助建立了六个工业合作社。邦政府在特里凡德琅拨出公有土地兴建一座纺织厂。据报刊报道，著名的大实业家比拉同意在喀拉拉邦建造一座人造丝浆液厂。邦政府也采取了措施来发展喀拉拉邦的水利。邦政府发展邦内二十六条河流的灌溉、水力、航运及其他潜力的巨大计划将近拟成。三个新的重大的灌溉计划已经包括在第二个五年计划之中了。
    在社会改革方面，邦政府也作了努力，颁布了一些法案，例如禁止嫁奁法案，喀拉拉邦产妇津贴法案。为了防止滥伐树木，邦立法议会还通过了授权政府对相连一百英亩以上的私有森林加以接管的私有森林管理法案。
    喀拉拉邦政府也面临了很大的困难。十年以来，喀拉拉邦从未有过稳定的政府。共产党领导的喀拉拉邦政府成立后，所有该邦的反对党派：国大党、人民社会党、穆斯林联盟都联合起来反对邦政府。他们进行了反对教育法案的活动，掀起了非法占据政府土地的事件。近来，他们又正在酝酿反对土地关系法案。反对派抱怨说，喀拉拉邦没有法律、没有秩序。他们企图贿赂邦立法议会中的共产党议员。不久以前，有人以巨款向一名共产党议员行贿，要他在立法议会中投票反对邦政府，这个阴谋被揭穿了。
    尼赫鲁总理、国大党主席德巴以及国大党其他领袖从4月起在几个月内要分别访问喀拉拉邦。据说国大党下届年会将在喀拉拉邦举行。
    尽管有这些反对，但是正如南布迪里巴德在最近一期“新世纪”周刊上所发表的文章中说的：“共产党政府执政的第一年已经开始打破共产党和属于其他党派的广大人民群众之间的隔阂。那些党派和共产党抱有同样的国家的目标：即建设社会主义印度。”他说，喀拉拉邦这一年的工作，已经有效地打破了所谓共产党执政意味着丧失民族传统和道德价值中一切良好东西的那种反共论点。
    南布迪里巴德又说，喀拉拉邦政府一直努力用和平方式促成社会经济的变化。他指出“过去一年的工作成绩足以证明我们在这方面卓著成效的努力。”“如果我们能够任满五年，我们就能够证明：我们在喀拉拉邦所促成的社会经济制度的变化，将超过印度境内的任何其他一邦。”
