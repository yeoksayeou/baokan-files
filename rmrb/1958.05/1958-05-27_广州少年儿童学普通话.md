    Guangzhou Children Learn Mandarin
    (Our report) Reporter Cai Zhonggui reports: Since the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League issued its call, the Young Pioneers in Guangzhou have taken active measures to learn to speak Mandarin in a variety of ways. To date, 70%-90% of the children in some schools have learned to speak Mandarin, and in some schools, Young Pioneers are answering teachers' questions in Mandarin. For example, teachers at Dexuan West Road Elementary School basically teach in Mandarin, which promotes students to automatically answer questions in Mandarin, and has also prompted more than two-thirds of the children in the school to learn to speak Mandarin.
    The Guangzhou Municipal Young Pioneers Department has carried out a variety of ways to learn Mandarin, such as through radio stations, service desks, "little teachers," holding on-site meetings, and compiling daily conversation teaching materials. Gaodi Street Elementary School has set up a Mandarin service desk, with "little teachers" acting as service personnel. After class, students bring objects and ask questions. Later, the service desk took a further step: more than thirty service personnel went out into the community and participated in activities with the students, learning to speak Mandarin together. At the same time, the school's brigade headquarters announces the number of people who have learned to speak Mandarin every day, which motivates students who are not actively learning to become active. At present, Young Pioneers in various schools are actively carrying out a friendship competition to learn to speak Mandarin before "June 1st" as a gift for International Children's Day.

    广州少年儿童学普通话
    本报讯　记者蔡忠桂报道：自从团中央发出号召以后，广州的少先队员就积极行动，采取各种方式来学讲普通话。到现在，已有些学校的70％—90％的小孩子学会讲普通话，也有一些学校的少先队员使用普通话回答老师的问题。如德宣西路小学的教师基本上做到用普通话教学，这样促进了学生自动用普通话回答问题，也促使该校有三分之二以上的小孩子学会讲普通话。
    广州市少先队部开展学讲普通话的方式是多种多样的，如广播站、服务台、小先生、开现场会议、编写日用对话教材等。高第街小学设立普通话服务台，让小先生来当服务员，下课后，同学们就拿着实物来问，后来，服务台又跃进一步，三十多个服务员，跑到群众中去，跟同学们一起活动，一起学讲普通话；同时，该校中队部每天都宣布学会讲普通话的人数，这样推动了不积极学习的同学，也积极起来。目前各校少先队员正积极开展要在“六一”前学会讲普通话的友谊竞赛，作为国际儿童节的献礼。
