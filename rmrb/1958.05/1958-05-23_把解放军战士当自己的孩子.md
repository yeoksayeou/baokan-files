　　I returned from the construction site and discovered a large hole in my pants, so I had to mend it myself. Who knew that mending pants would be more difficult than building a house! After a great deal of effort, I managed to patch it up, but when I put them on, I couldn't help but laugh at myself. One wrinkle followed another, making them look very unsightly. Annoyed, I unpicked it and sewed it again; I unpicked and sewed, sewed and unpicked, and after three days, I still hadn't worn them.

　　An elderly Tibetan woman, who was helping us with the camp construction, saw me struggling and said with concern, "Child, let me sew it for you!" The old woman quickly mended them for me, making me feel very embarrassed. I thought that a People's Liberation Army soldier shouldn't "exploit" the old woman's labor, so I offered her some money as payment. But when she saw the money, she said angrily, "My child is a soldier in the Panchen Guard Battalion, just like you. When I see any soldier of the People's Liberation Army, I feel the same heartache as I do for my own child; how can I take money for mending your clothes? It's not right!" Then she told me, "You are working day and night for the sake of the Tibetan people, so what does it matter to help you with such a small thing?"

　　My heart was filled with emotion for a long time, and I said silently, "Old woman, I am so grateful to you." (Attached image)

    把解放军战士当自己的孩子
  　陈旭
    我从工地回来，发现裤子破了一个大洞，只好自己动手来补它。谁知补裤子比我盖房子还困难呢！费了九牛二虎之力补好了，穿起一看连我自己都禁不住要笑了，一个皱折连着一个皱折，非常难看。一生气，我就拆了再缝；就这样拆了又补，补了又缝，一直补了三天还没穿到身上。
    一位帮助我们营建的藏族老妈妈，看见了我这个样子后，就关怀地对我说：“孩子，让我来给你缝吧！”老妈妈很快地替我缝好了，使我很不好意思。我想，人民战士不能“剥削”老妈妈的劳动，就拿了些钱给她作报酬。谁知她一看到钱就生气地对我说：“我的孩子在班禅警卫营当兵，和你们一样都是解放军。我看到解放军的任何一个战士，都跟我的孩子一样心疼；难道给你补补衣服就要钱，这像话吗？”接着她又告诉我说：“你们为了西藏人民，黑夜白天忙着工作，帮你们做这点事算什么。”
    我心里久久不能平静，默默地说：“老妈妈，我太感谢您了。”（附图片）
