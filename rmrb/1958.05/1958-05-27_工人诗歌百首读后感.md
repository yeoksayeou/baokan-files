    Reflections After Reading One Hundred Poems by Workers
    Mao Dun
    The "Poetry Journal" editorial department sent a letter soliciting opinions on the "Worker's Hundred Poems" special issue of the "Poetry Journal" April issue and "Workers Talk About Poetry." I cannot write poetry, but after reading the one hundred poems by workers and workers' discussions about poetry, I am very excited and willing to follow the "outsider talking about poetry" approach, briefly stating my thoughts after reading.
    The "Workers Talk About Poetry" section was likely compiled by the "Poetry Journal" editorial department after posing three questions and soliciting the opinions of worker comrades, then arranging the answers. These opinions are much better than some "poetry theories"; they concisely point out the problems of some of our professional poets today and offer solutions. What are the problems? They are that "the authors do not have a deep understanding of life, often only a little poetic sentiment, and the expression is not enough to move people's hearts, but in order to write poetry, they resort to skills, deliberately embellishing the language and pursuing a so-called unique style"; some poems are "mostly Westernized in plot, emotion, and language." This is a truly insightful comment! How can these problems be cured? In addition to pointing out that poets must go deep into life and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, the worker comrades also put forward positive and concrete proposals: First, "How can poetry become the property of the masses? In my opinion, it should be short and pay attention to the style of folk songs. If you use the tone of folk songs to write about the labor of our workers, I don't think there will be any power. The idea is how to creatively combine folk songs with our new content and turn them into a new form that both inherits tradition and is innovative." This opinion is very important, and I fully support it; it seems that no one has ever mentioned this opinion before. Second, it requires "poems with prominent themes, rich emotions, lively rhythms, high spirits, majestic momentum, bold tones, rhythmic patterns, and easy-to-understand language." Third, "Our poets have written many poems about plateaus, grasslands, and plains, but too few poems about copper, steel, and iron."
    The worker comrades put forward these correct proposals and also put them into practice. The hundred poems in the April issue of "Poetry Journal" are the evidence before us.
    For example, Wen Chengxun's "Evergreen Pine," Li Chengrong's "Apprentice's Question," Zou Jilu's "Ventilation Worker," Hou Yue's "On the Train," Shen Che's "Fabric Inspection Girl," Sun Yingmo's "Late at Night," Shen Guoliang's "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy," Chen Zhenkun's "Female Flatbed Cart Driver": these poems, whether long (such as "Evergreen Pine") or short (such as "Late at Night"), all shape the images of advanced figures, allowing us to see those characters and hear their voices. These poems each have their own style; for example, "Fabric Inspection Girl" and "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy" are different, and also different from "Female Flatbed Cart Driver." "Fabric Inspection Girl" is only eight lines long, the first two lines describe the image of the fabric inspection girl, actually only one line, but we seem to see those shrewd eyes, and also seem to see her whole figure. This simple way of sketching characters with a few strokes also allows us to see the image of the loyal and patriotic Party committee secretary in "Late at Night." However, "Fabric Inspection Girl" and "Late at Night" are different in style except for this point. The former is four chapters with two lines each, a total of eight lines: the latter is two chapters with four lines each. The former is a mixture of narration (description) and commentary (expression of emotion), the first two lines are description, but also express emotion, the third and fourth lines seem to be expressing emotion, but after repeated chanting, it is still description, the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth lines are also the same technique. The latter is a complete narrative (description), but after reading it, a feeling of admiration and praise (expression of emotion) naturally emerges. "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy" is another style. This poem is three chapters with four lines each, completed in one breath, filling our ears with happy sounds, and we also seem to see this lovely girl who is extremely busy. The first line of the second chapter of this poem is the last line of the first chapter, and the first line of the third chapter is the last line of the second chapter. This technique of linking down (which also exists in our classical poetry) can strengthen the atmosphere of the theme (extremely busy) of the poem. Moreover, only one line (the second line) of the four lines in the third chapter is not a reprise, the other three lines, except for the first line which reprises the last line of the previous chapter, the third and fourth lines both reprise the first two lines of the first chapter, but the order of the original sentence is reversed: this strengthens the jumping and joyful atmosphere of the poem. The style of "Female Flatbed Cart Driver" is different from the previous two poems. This uses heavy strokes to depict the group image of new women in the new era. The opening four lines, using an old saying to describe, are "thrown to the ground to make the sound of gold and stone." The last chapter (the fourth chapter) has a very novel conception and concise and vigorous sentence structure. Look: "People urge the cart, the cart urges people, catch up, catch up, catch up so that the young men sing a riot of triumphant songs." Isn't this image vivid? Isn't it hot? However, the second chapter of this poem is somewhat weak, because the artistic conception and language are outdated.
    "Ventilation Worker" has a total of six chapters, each chapter with four lines. The first five chapters use delicate brushstrokes to describe this respectable and lovely ventilation worker, but the sixth chapter takes a turn, using imagination and lyricism to sing praises to socialism, the artistic conception is very novel, and the language is solemn and joyful. "On the Train" is a lyrical poem, with a total of four chapters, each chapter with four lines; judging from the theme and layout of this poem, it is difficult to write without falling into clich√©s, but the author creatively paused at the critical point, making the whole article flexible:
    The commemorative badge attracted every pair of eyes,
    I couldn't help but straighten my chest.
    Look, comrades, there is no secret,
    Thousands of construction workers are just like me!
    The second line here is a novel and powerful sentence, which leads to the following two sentences, which the reader did not expect, but are very logical. From here, the last chapter emerges, naturally and movingly depicting the high degree of socialist consciousness of this construction worker (one of thousands).
    In "Workers Talk About Poetry," many worker comrades pointed out that writing poetry requires skills, but skills are not equal to affectation, affectation, or stacking of rhetoric. The poems mentioned above are skillful, but there are no faults such as affectation, affectation, or stacking. More examples of such "miraculous coincidences" of skill can be cited:
    Sparse stars, dim night
    The gravel road is bumpy
    The pounding steam hammer wants to awaken the earth
    The street lamp melts a busy figure
                (Evergreen Pine)
    There are only four lines here in total, but they describe the night scene, the tense working atmosphere of the factory in the late night, and the old master who "retired but his heart did not retire" rushing to the workshop at this moment. Moreover, the fourth sentence, refining words and sentences, is so novel and so vivid; this is writing about a person in action, and the spirit lies entirely in the word "melt."
    Look at those shiny needles and medicines,
    clamoring to leave the factory early!
                (Fire Seed)
    These two lines are epigrams in the whole poem. It is a pity that the remaining lines of this poem lack a fresh artistic conception, so this poem can only be regarded as complete and stable. Another poem by the same author, "On the Commuter Bus," is better than this one. This is four chapters, each chapter four lines; the image of the red scarf, although only a few simple strokes, is very prominent. But it is full of lyricism, making people feel the warmth of the new era, which is the last chapter. The first two sentences here are a reprise, and the following two sentences shift from the real red scarf to the red scarf that may exist in the dream of the worker who is "soundly asleep," with profound meaning. The same author also has a poem "Apprentice's Question," which is written so naturally and sincerely, it is truly "as if seeing the person, as if hearing the voice."
    These skills come from life, not from carving or imitation. Carving can only produce delicacy, and imitation can only produce affectation. The ancients called such skills that come from life "miraculous coincidences," although the meaning is the same as ours, which means that skills cannot be obtained by carving and imitation. This is precisely the fault that some professional poets often make.
    Among the hundred poems, there are also a few poems that have the fault of "empty talk" and "writing poetry for the sake of writing poetry"; precisely because there is "only a little poetic sentiment" but they insist on writing, they have to resort to so-called "skills," and then the faults of carving and stacking all come together. However, in all fairness, the percentage of these faults in the hundred poems is very small, only two or three. There are also a few poems that, despite their faults, also have their advantages. For example, "Singing on the Punching Machine" does not have a particularly novel artistic conception, but it has momentum; "Spring is in the World" is slightly empty, but it renders a kind of "spring" atmosphere, giving people a feeling of "joyfully filling the ears." "Bombarding Waste" has the flavor of folk songs, and the magic lies in the last sentence, which enlivens the whole poem (a total of five sentences).
    Due to time constraints, my thoughts after reading will end here. I think our professional poets should learn from amateur worker writers in many ways; at the same time, I also feel that some of the faults in the hundred poems by workers may have been unconsciously infected by reading too many bad poetry collections. Some of our bad poetry collections are still very famous, for example, the right-wing element Ai Qing, who is said to have international reputation. I see a lot of affectation in his poetry collections. However, because he has this little bit of false fame, and he is proud and conceited, he has never self-criticized his works, but instead appears as a mentor from time to time, so some young people intentionally imitate him, or are unconsciously influenced by him. Therefore, I think that worker comrades who are rich in life struggle experience should give play to creativity and try not to fall into the set of tones of established poets.
    Finally, I plan to offer four sentences to worker authors:
    "The laborer sings about his work," why professionalize;
    Give play to creativity, open up a new era of poetry.
