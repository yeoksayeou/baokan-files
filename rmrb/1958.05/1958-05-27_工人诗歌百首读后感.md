    Reflections After Reading One Hundred Poems by Workers
    Mao Dun
    The "Poetry Journal" editorial department sent a letter soliciting opinions on the "Worker's Hundred Poems" special issue of the "Poetry Journal" April issue and "Workers Talk About Poetry." I cannot write poetry, but after reading the one hundred poems by workers and workers' discussions about poetry, I am very excited and willing to follow the "outsider talking about poetry" approach, briefly stating my thoughts after reading.
    The "Workers Talk About Poetry" section was likely compiled by the "Poetry Journal" editorial department after posing three questions and soliciting the opinions of worker comrades, then arranging the answers. These opinions are much better than some "poetry theories"; they concisely point out the problems of some of our professional poets today and offer solutions. What are the problems? They are that "the authors do not have a deep understanding of life, often only a little poetic sentiment, and the expression is not enough to move people's hearts, but in order to write poetry, they resort to skills, deliberately embellishing the language and pursuing a so-called unique style"; some poems are "mostly Westernized in plot, emotion, and language." This is a truly insightful comment! How can these problems be cured? In addition to pointing out that poets must go deep into life and learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, the worker comrades also put forward positive and concrete proposals: First, "How can poetry become the property of the masses? In my opinion, it should be short and pay attention to the style of folk songs. If you use the tone of folk songs to write about the labor of our workers, I don't think there will be any power. The idea is how to creatively combine folk songs with our new content and turn them into a new form that both inherits tradition and is innovative." This opinion is very important, and I fully support it; it seems that no one has ever mentioned this opinion before. Second, it requires "poems with prominent themes, rich emotions, lively rhythms, high spirits, majestic momentum, bold tones, rhythmic patterns, and easy-to-understand language." Third, "Our poets have written many poems about plateaus, grasslands, and plains, but too few poems about copper, steel, and iron."
    The worker comrades put forward these correct proposals and also put them into practice. The hundred poems in the April issue of "Poetry Journal" are the evidence before us.
    For example, Wen Chengxun's "Evergreen Pine," Li Chengrong's "Apprentice's Question," Zou Jilu's "Ventilation Worker," Hou Yue's "On the Train," Shen Che's "Fabric Inspection Girl," Sun Yingmo's "Late at Night," Shen Guoliang's "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy," Chen Zhenkun's "Female Flatbed Cart Driver": these poems, whether long (such as "Evergreen Pine") or short (such as "Late at Night"), all shape the images of advanced figures, allowing us to see those characters and hear their voices. These poems each have their own style; for example, "Fabric Inspection Girl" and "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy" are different, and also different from "Female Flatbed Cart Driver." "Fabric Inspection Girl" is only eight lines long, the first two lines describe the image of the fabric inspection girl, actually only one line, but we seem to see those shrewd eyes, and also seem to see her whole figure. This simple way of sketching characters with a few strokes also allows us to see the image of the loyal and patriotic Party committee secretary in "Late at Night." However, "Fabric Inspection Girl" and "Late at Night" are different in style except for this point. The former is four chapters with two lines each, a total of eight lines: the latter is two chapters with four lines each. The former is a mixture of narration (description) and commentary (expression of emotion), the first two lines are description, but also express emotion, the third and fourth lines seem to be expressing emotion, but after repeated chanting, it is still description, the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth lines are also the same technique. The latter is a complete narrative (description), but after reading it, a feeling of admiration and praise (expression of emotion) naturally emerges. "Female Announcer is Extremely Busy" is another style. This poem is three chapters with four lines each, completed in one breath, filling our ears with happy sounds, and we also seem to see this lovely girl who is extremely busy. The first line of the second chapter of this poem is the last line of the first chapter, and the first line of the third chapter is the last line of the second chapter. This technique of linking down (which also exists in our classical poetry) can strengthen the atmosphere of the theme (extremely busy) of the poem. Moreover, only one line (the second line) of the four lines in the third chapter is not a reprise, the other three lines, except for the first line which reprises the last line of the previous chapter, the third and fourth lines both reprise the first two lines of the first chapter, but the order of the original sentence is reversed: this strengthens the jumping and joyful atmosphere of the poem. The style of "Female Flatbed Cart Driver" is different from the previous two poems. This uses heavy strokes to depict the group image of new women in the new era. The opening four lines, using an old saying to describe, are "thrown to the ground to make the sound of gold and stone." The last chapter (the fourth chapter) has a very novel conception and concise and vigorous sentence structure. Look: "People urge the cart, the cart urges people, catch up, catch up, catch up so that the young men sing a riot of triumphant songs." Isn't this image vivid? Isn't it hot? However, the second chapter of this poem is somewhat weak, because the artistic conception and language are outdated.
    "Ventilation Worker" has a total of six chapters, each chapter with four lines. The first five chapters use delicate brushstrokes to describe this respectable and lovely ventilation worker, but the sixth chapter takes a turn, using imagination and lyricism to sing praises to socialism, the artistic conception is very novel, and the language is solemn and joyful. "On the Train" is a lyrical poem, with a total of four chapters, each chapter with four lines; judging from the theme and layout of this poem, it is difficult to write without falling into clichés, but the author creatively paused at the critical point, making the whole article flexible:
    The commemorative badge attracted every pair of eyes,
    I couldn't help but straighten my chest.
    Look, comrades, there is no secret,
    Thousands of construction workers are just like me!
    The second line here is a novel and powerful sentence, which leads to the following two sentences, which the reader did not expect, but are very logical. From here, the last chapter emerges, naturally and movingly depicting the high degree of socialist consciousness of this construction worker (one of thousands).
    In "Workers Talk About Poetry," many worker comrades pointed out that writing poetry requires skills, but skills are not equal to affectation, affectation, or stacking of rhetoric. The poems mentioned above are skillful, but there are no faults such as affectation, affectation, or stacking. More examples of such "miraculous coincidences" of skill can be cited:
    Sparse stars, dim night
    The gravel road is bumpy
    The pounding steam hammer wants to awaken the earth
    The street lamp melts a busy figure
                (Evergreen Pine)
    There are only four lines here in total, but they describe the night scene, the tense working atmosphere of the factory in the late night, and the old master who "retired but his heart did not retire" rushing to the workshop at this moment. Moreover, the fourth sentence, refining words and sentences, is so novel and so vivid; this is writing about a person in action, and the spirit lies entirely in the word "melt."
    Look at those shiny needles and medicines,
    clamoring to leave the factory early!
                (Fire Seed)
    These two lines are epigrams in the whole poem. It is a pity that the remaining lines of this poem lack a fresh artistic conception, so this poem can only be regarded as complete and stable. Another poem by the same author, "On the Commuter Bus," is better than this one. This is four chapters, each chapter four lines; the image of the red scarf, although only a few simple strokes, is very prominent. But it is full of lyricism, making people feel the warmth of the new era, which is the last chapter. The first two sentences here are a reprise, and the following two sentences shift from the real red scarf to the red scarf that may exist in the dream of the worker who is "soundly asleep," with profound meaning. The same author also has a poem "Apprentice's Question," which is written so naturally and sincerely, it is truly "as if seeing the person, as if hearing the voice."
    These skills come from life, not from carving or imitation. Carving can only produce delicacy, and imitation can only produce affectation. The ancients called such skills that come from life "miraculous coincidences," although the meaning is the same as ours, which means that skills cannot be obtained by carving and imitation. This is precisely the fault that some professional poets often make.
    Among the hundred poems, there are also a few poems that have the fault of "empty talk" and "writing poetry for the sake of writing poetry"; precisely because there is "only a little poetic sentiment" but they insist on writing, they have to resort to so-called "skills," and then the faults of carving and stacking all come together. However, in all fairness, the percentage of these faults in the hundred poems is very small, only two or three. There are also a few poems that, despite their faults, also have their advantages. For example, "Singing on the Punching Machine" does not have a particularly novel artistic conception, but it has momentum; "Spring is in the World" is slightly empty, but it renders a kind of "spring" atmosphere, giving people a feeling of "joyfully filling the ears." "Bombarding Waste" has the flavor of folk songs, and the magic lies in the last sentence, which enlivens the whole poem (a total of five sentences).
    Due to time constraints, my thoughts after reading will end here. I think our professional poets should learn from amateur worker writers in many ways; at the same time, I also feel that some of the faults in the hundred poems by workers may have been unconsciously infected by reading too many bad poetry collections. Some of our bad poetry collections are still very famous, for example, the right-wing element Ai Qing, who is said to have international reputation. I see a lot of affectation in his poetry collections. However, because he has this little bit of false fame, and he is proud and conceited, he has never self-criticized his works, but instead appears as a mentor from time to time, so some young people intentionally imitate him, or are unconsciously influenced by him. Therefore, I think that worker comrades who are rich in life struggle experience should give play to creativity and try not to fall into the set of tones of established poets.
    Finally, I plan to offer four sentences to worker authors:
    "The laborer sings about his work," why professionalize;
    Give play to creativity, open up a new era of poetry.

### 工人诗歌百首读后感

    工人诗歌百首读后感
    茅盾
    “诗刊”编辑部来信征询对于“诗刊”四月号特辑“工人百首诗歌”及“工人谈诗”的意见。我不会作诗，但读了工人诗歌百首及工人谈诗以后，很兴奋，愿意效“门外谈诗”，略述读后感。
    “工人谈诗”这一辑想来是“诗刊”编辑部提出三个问题，征询工人同志的意见，而后就答案编排的。这些意见，比有些“诗论”好得多；它们很扼要地指出了今天我们的一部分专业诗人的毛病，并提出了治病的方案。毛病是什么？就是“作者对生活并没有深切的感受，往往只有一点点诗意，表现出来并不足以激动人心，但为了要写诗，而去求救于技巧，在语言上故意雕琢，追求所谓独特风格”；有些诗，“在情节上、感情上、语言上都多半是西洋化的”。这真是一针见血之论！怎样医治这些毛病呢？工人同志们除了指出诗人们必须深入生活，向工农兵学习，还提出了积极的具体的主张：一、“诗歌如何变成群众的东西呢？依我看，要短小，并且要注意有民歌的风格。你要用民歌的调子来写我们工人的劳动，我看也没有力量。意思是如何把民歌和我们新的内容创造性地结合起来，变成一种既继承传统又新颖的新形式”。这个意见，十分重要，我完全拥护；这个意见，好像还不见有人提过。二、要求“主题突出、感情丰富、节奏明快、情绪高昂、气势磅礴、语调豪迈、有板有韵、通俗易懂的诗。”三、“我们的诗人写了许多高原的、草原的、平原的诗，但，铜的、钢的、铁的诗写得太少了”。
    工人同志提出了这些正确的主张，同时也付之实践。“诗刊”四月号的百首诗歌就是眼前的证据。
    例如温承训的“不老松”，李成荣的“学徒的问话”，邹积禄的“通风工”，侯钺的“火车上”，沈澈的“验布姑娘”，孙迎谟的“深夜了”，沈国梁的“女广播员可忙透了”，陈振坤的“女板车手”：这几首诗，或长（如“不老松”）或短（如“深夜了”），可是都塑造了先进的人物形象，让我们就同看见了那些人物，听见了他们的声音一样。这些诗，各有自己的风格；例如“验布姑娘”和“女广播员可忙透了”不同，和“女板车手”也不同。“验布姑娘”只短短八句，第一二句描写验布姑娘的形象，实只一句，可是我们就像看见了那么一双精明的眼睛，同时也像看见了她的整个的身形。这样简单几笔勾勒出人物的手法，在“深夜了”这首诗中又让我们看见了忠心耿耿、为党为国的党委书记的形象。但是，“验布姑娘”和“深夜了”这两首诗，除了这一点是相同而外，就各有其不同的风格。前者是两句一章的四章，共八句：后者是四句一章的两章。前者是夹叙（描）夹议（抒情），第一二句是描写，但同时也抒情，第三四句表面看是抒情了，可是再三讽咏，便觉得这还是描写，第五、六、七、八句也是同样的手法。后者却是通体叙述（描写），但我们读了，一种景仰赞叹的情感（抒情）就自然出来了。“女广播员可忙透了”另是一种风格。这诗是每章四句共三章，通篇一气呵成，让我们的耳朵里洋洋乎充满了快乐的声音，同时我们也仿佛看见了这位忙透了的可爱的姑娘。这首诗的第二章的第一句就是第一章的最后一句，第三章的首句又是第二章的末句，这样勾连而下的手法（我们古典诗歌中亦有之）可以加强诗的主题（忙透）的气氛。而且第三章的四句只有一句（第二句）不是重唱，其余三句，除第一句重唱上章的末句，三四两句都是重唱第一章开头两句，可又颠倒了原句的次序：这样就加强了诗的跳踉欢乐的气氛。“女板车手”的风格和前二诗又自不同。这是用了浓重的笔触刻划新时代的新女性群像。开头四句，用一句老话来形容，就是“掷地作金石声。”最后一章（第四章），设想很新颖，造句也简洁遒劲。你看：“人催车，车催人，赶上去呵赶上去，赶得小伙们唱乱了得意的歌声。”这形象还不生动？还不热惹惹地？不过，这诗的第二章却嫌弱些，为的是意境和语言都落了陈套。
    “通风工”共六章，章四句。前五章都是用细致的笔墨描写这个可敬可爱的通风工，第六章却笔锋一转，用想像和抒情唱出对社会主义的颂扬，意境很新颖，语言也是庄严中带着欢笑。“火车上”是一首抒情诗，共四章，章四句；这首诗就其题材和布局看来，很难写得不落陈套，可是，作者在紧要去处创造性地笔锋一顿，就使通篇灵活：
    纪念章吸引了每双眼睛，
    我不由得挺起胸膛。
    看吧，同志，没有什么秘密，
    成千的建筑工人的都跟我一样！
    这里的第二句是又新颖又有力的一句，它引起了下面两句，却又是读者料不到的，可又十分顺理成章。从这里，又生发出最后一章，十分自然、又十分感人地描写了这一位建筑工人（成千中的一个）的高度的社会主义自觉。
    “工人谈诗”中，许多工人同志都指出，写诗需要技巧，但技巧不等于矫揉造作，扭扭??，也不等于堆砌词藻。上面讲到的这几首诗，就是有技巧的，然而并无矫揉造作、扭?堆砌等等毛病。这样的“妙手偶得”的技巧，还可以再举几个例子：
    稀疏的星，夜色朦胧
    碎石的路坎坷不平
    咚咚的汽锤想把大地震醒
    路灯溶化了一个奔忙的人影
                  （不老松）
    这里一共只有四句，然而它写了夜景，写了深夜中紧张工作的工厂气氛，写了“人退休了心没退休”的老师傅在此时此际奔向车间去。而且，第四句，炼字炼句，多么新颖，又多么生动；这是写行动中的人，传神处全在“溶化”二字。
    你看那些亮晶晶的针药呵，
    吵闹着要早点出厂！
                  （火种）
    这两句在全诗中是警句。很可惜，这首诗的其余诗句缺少新鲜的意境，所以，这首诗只能算是工稳而已。同一作者的另一首诗，“交通车上”，却比这一首好。这是四章，章四句；红领巾的形象虽只简单几笔，却很突出。但富有抒情味，使人感得新时代的温馨的，是最后一章。这里首二句是重唱，下边两句从现实的红领巾转到“沉沉地睡着”的那位工人的梦境中可能有的红领巾，意味深长。同一作者还有一首“学徒的问话”，写得那么自然而真切，正所谓“如见其人，如闻其声”。
    这些技巧，是从生活中来的，而不是雕琢、摹拟的结果。雕琢只能产生纤巧，摹拟只能产生矫揉造作。前人称这样的从生活中来的技巧为“妙手偶得”，虽然跟我们的说法不同，意义还是一样，就是说，不能靠雕琢和摹拟来取得技巧。这一点，却正是一部分专业诗人常常犯的毛病。
    百首诗歌中，也有少数几首有“言之无物”、“为作诗而作诗”的毛病；正因为“只有一点点诗意”而硬要写，便不得不求救于所谓“技巧”，于是，雕琢、堆砌的毛病一齐都来了。不过，平心而论，这些毛病，在百首诗歌中，它的百分比是很小的，只有二、三首。还有几首尽管有毛病，然而也有它们的优点。例如“冲压机上放歌”，意境未见怎样新颖，可是有气魄；“春在人间”微嫌空泛，可是渲染出一种“春”的气氛，给人以“洋洋乎盈耳”的快感。“向浪费开炮”有民歌风味，妙在最后一句把全诗（共五句）活跃起来。
    限于时间，我的读后感就到此为止。我以为我们的专业诗人有不少地方应当向业余的工人作家们学习；同时，我也觉得，工人百首诗歌中有些毛病，说不定还是多读了不好的诗歌集无意中传染来的。我们有些坏诗集却还名气很大呢，例如号称已有国际声誉的右派分子艾青，我看他诗集中，装腔作势的东西就很多。然而因为他有这么一点虚名，而且他又骄傲自负，他从没对自己的作品来一次自我批评，反而时时以导师面目出现，于是有些青年有意摹仿他，或者无形中受他影响。因此，我以为富于生活斗争经验的工人同志们要发挥创造性，尽量不落既成诗人们的那一套腔调。
    最后，我打算奉赠工人作者四句话：
    “劳者歌其事”，何必专业化；
    发挥创造性，开一代诗风。
