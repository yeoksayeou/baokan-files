Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 18th: Work-study programs in Shanghai's universities are not only production courses, but also extremely vivid and profound political education lessons.

	Starting this semester, Shanghai's universities have adopted methods such as organizing students to participate in work-study activities in factories, laboratories, construction sites, and farms both on and off campus for three months to a year, or for about one day a week. Almost all students actively signed up to participate in physical labor, but not all of them fully understood the significance of labor. Some students only wanted to learn technology from labor, willing to do work that required high technical skills but was not too strenuous. Some students believed that workers only had experience but no knowledge, and that physical labor was simple, requiring only physical strength.

	Who exactly lacked knowledge? The university students quickly found the answer in their labor practice. In a certain factory, an experienced worker discovered that the cutting tool used by an engineering student who was an apprentice lathe operator was not hard enough and told her to quench it. Although this student had read about the theory of quenching in books, she did not know in which workshop the quenching work was carried out. After thinking about it, she did not go to the forging workshop, but mistakenly went to the welding workshop. Workers could make hundreds of hexagonal nuts a day, while students initially used all their strength to make only three or four a day, and many were defective. An experienced worker made a box of models in a dozen minutes, while students could not make one even in an hour. After taking this first lesson in labor, the students realized that physical labor was not a simple matter.

	The participation of university students in labor was warmly welcomed by the workers. The workers unreservedly passed on all their skills to these new apprentices. Some experienced workers even signed apprenticeship contracts with them, teaching from five or six in the morning until eight or nine in the evening. Some second-year students majoring in railway construction at Tongji University often had cracks in the welds when welding threads of electrical conduits. After the experienced worker pointed it out, they realized that this was because the distance between the support point and the force point was too large during welding. The students then sincerely felt that the experienced workers had both practical experience and theory, and were truly their "good professors."

	Some students were usually quite undisciplined and casual. When participating in labor, they also treated being a few minutes late or leaving early as trivial matters. Once, a student packed up his things more than ten minutes before the end of work, intending to go take a shower. As soon as he reached the entrance of the workshop, the experienced worker saw him and immediately called him back, frankly saying to him: "Since you have come to be a worker, don't you know the labor discipline? Workers themselves generally arrive early for work, change into work clothes, and prepare their tools, and immediately engage in intense labor as soon as work starts. Some workers even strive to do more work and leave later when it is almost time to get off work." Under the influence of the workers, many students discussed the issues of organization and discipline in labor and consciously observed discipline. Some students even collectively formulated labor covenants.

	In the practice factories of East China Textile Engineering Institute and Jiaotong University, such things have happened: some students were very enthusiastic about production, but were sloppy in doing chores such as sweeping the floor, sweeping away good iron sheets, piles of coal, and even tools along with the garbage. As a result, they were picked up from the garbage by the workers. This incident educated all the students, making them regard the workers' attitude of being masters toward ordinary labor and state property as their own example.

	After personally participating in physical labor, the students truly realized the difficulty of material resources, and that every thread, every grain of rice, and every spoonful of porridge comes from hard work, and that laborers are nurturing themselves with their own blood and sweat. Some students used to make excessive demands on the school for living benefits, demanding the construction of swimming pools or clubs, but now they have also begun to consciously make their living standards closer to those of the working people.

	The students have experienced the hardship of labor in labor practice, and also the joy of labor. Now, everyone is competing to do all kinds of work, whether it is heavy work or chores. After a period of serious training, the students' production skills have improved rapidly. Students of Shanghai Fisheries College created a new record for entering and exiting the ice storage of Shanghai Fisheries Company's fish processing plant at minus twenty degrees Celsius, and were praised by the factory. Students of East China Textile Engineering Institute produced the first batch of high-quality yarn and the first piece of Dongyun呢 in work-study activities. Under the guidance of teachers and technicians, students of Fudan University produced a batch of advanced precision instruments and valuable chemical reagents, some of which have not yet been produced by domestic factories.

	Some students and workers jointly study rationalization proposals, some students even suggest drawing sketches for the workers, some have signed contracts with workers to teach each other technology and culture, and many students have become good friends with workers.

	Enthusiastic university students have created many hymns to express their new feelings for labor and working people. A student at Tongji University wrote in one of his poems describing forging labor: Sparks splashed in the furnace, the blower accompanied the music, the hammer sang. Labor, if it weren't for a red line connecting us, how could our feelings be so matched! Two students from Fudan University who participated in labor at the glass factory, one wrote the lyrics and the other composed the music, and wrote a "Song of the Glass Workers."

### 上海高等学校学生在体力劳动中受到深刻教育  勤工俭学是生产课又是政治课

　　上海高等学校学生在体力劳动中受到深刻教育
    勤工俭学是生产课又是政治课
    新华社上海18日电　勤工俭学在上海各高等学校中不仅是一门劳动生产课，而且是一门极其生动、深刻的政治教育课。
    这学期起，上海各高等学校都采取了劳动三个月到一年或每周抽出一天左右的时间参加劳动等方式，组织学生在校内外工厂、实验室、工地、农场参加勤工俭学活动。差不多所有的学生都积极报名要求参加体力劳动，但是他们当中并不是人人都充分认识到劳动的意义，有些学生只想从劳动中学技术，愿意做技术要求高而又不太劳累的工作，有些学生认为工人只有经验没有知识，体力劳动很简单，只要出力气就行了。
    究竟是谁没有知识呢？大学生们在劳动实践中很快找到了答案。某工厂里有个老师傅发现一个做车工学徒的工科大学生所用的刀具硬度不够，叫她拿去淬淬火。这位大学生虽然在书本上读过淬火的理论，可是并不知道淬火的工作究竟在哪个工场进行，想了又想，她没有到锻工场，却错跑到焊接工场去了。工人打六角螺母一天打几百只，学生起初用尽全身之力一天才打三、四只，而且很多是废品。老师傅用十几分钟做了一箱模型，学生做了一小时还做不出来。这样的上了劳动的第一课，学生们才体会到体力劳动并不是简单的事。
    大学生参加劳动，受到工人们热烈欢迎。工人们毫无保留地把自己的技术全部传授给这些新徒弟。有些老师傅和他们订立了师徒合同，从早上五六点一直教到晚上八、九点。同济大学铁道建筑专业二年级的一些学生在焊接电线管的螺纹时，焊缝常常裂开。经老师傅一指点，才知道这是因为焊接时支点与力点距离太大了。学生们这才心悦诚服地感到老师傅又有实际又有理论，真是自己的“好教授”。
    有些学生平常比较自由散漫，参加劳动时也把迟到早退几分钟当作无所谓的事。有一次，一个学生在下班前十多分钟就把自己的东西收拾好，打算去洗澡了。刚走到车间门口，老师傅看见了，立刻将他叫回来，坦率地对他说：“你既然来当工人，难道不知道劳动纪律吗？工人们自己一般都是提早上班，换好工作服，准备好工具，一上班就投入紧张的劳动。有些工人到快下班的时候还争取再多做一些活，迟些再走。”在工人们的影响下，很多学生对劳动中的组织性纪律性问题进行了讨论，做到了自觉地遵守纪律。有些学生还集体订出了劳动公约。
    在华东纺织工学院和交通大学的实习工厂里都发生过这样的事：有些学生生产很起劲，做扫地等杂活却马马虎虎，把很好的铁皮、成堆的煤块甚至工具都和垃圾混在一起扫掉了，结果又被工人们从垃圾里拣了回来。这件事教育了所有的学生，使他们把工人对待平凡劳动，对待国家财产的主人翁态度当作自己的榜样。
    亲身参加体力劳动以后，学生们才真正体会到物力维艰，半丝半缕、一粥一饭，都来之不易，劳动人身是用自己的血汗在培养着自己。有些学生过去常向学校要求过高的生活福利，不是要求修游泳池，就是要求修俱乐部，现在也开始自觉地使自己的生活水平更加接近劳动人民。
    学生们在劳动实践中体会到劳动的艰辛，同时也体会到劳动的愉快。现在，所有的工作不论是重活或杂活，都有人争着干。经过一个时期的认真锻炼，学生们的生产技能提高得很快。上海水产学院的学生在上海水产公司鱼品加工厂零下二十多度的冰库里创造了进出库的新纪录，受到了工厂的表扬。华东纺织工学院的学生们在勤工俭学活动中生产出第一批优质纱和第一匹东云呢。复旦大学学生们在教师和技工的指导下生产出一批高级精密仪器和贵重的化学试剂，其中一部分是国内工厂尚未生产过的。
    有些学生和工人一道研究合理化建议，有的学生还替工人们建议绘制草图，有的和工人订立了互教技术和文化的合同，不少学生已经和工人做了好朋友。
    热情的大学生们创作了不少赞歌，来表达自己对劳动和劳动人民的新的感情。同济大学一个学生在自己的一首描写锻工劳动的诗歌中写道：炉中溅起了烟火，鼓风机进行着伴奏，铁锤唱着歌。劳动呵，要不是一条红线连起，咱们的感情怎能这样吻合！复旦大学参加玻璃工场劳动的两个学生，一个作词，一个作曲，写出了一首“玻璃工人之歌”。
