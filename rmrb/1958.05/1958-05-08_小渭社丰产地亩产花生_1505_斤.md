Agricultural High Yield Achievements

    Xiaowei Agricultural Cooperative in Yanjin County, Henan Province, harvested an average peanut yield of 420 jin per mu from its 114 mu of peanut fields last year. Among them, two mu of high-yield land achieved an average yield of 1505 jin per mu, setting a new national record for peanut yield per unit area.
    Selecting superior varieties is one of the important conditions for this cooperative to achieve high yields. Before sowing, the seeds were also subjected to grain selection, soaking, and seed mixing (mixing with rhizobium).

    小渭社丰产地亩产花生1505斤
    河南延津县小渭农业社去年种植的一百一十四亩花生，平均亩产四百二十斤。其中二亩丰产地平均亩产一千五百零五斤，创造了全国花生单产最高纪录。
    选用良种是这个社创造高额丰产的重要条件之一。在播种以前，对种子还进行了粒选、浸种、拌种（用根瘤菌拌）。
