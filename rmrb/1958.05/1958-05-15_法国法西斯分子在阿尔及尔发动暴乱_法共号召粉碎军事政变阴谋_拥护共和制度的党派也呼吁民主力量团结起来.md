Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Paris: On May 13th, the 28th day of the French government crisis, French far-right elements, colluding with parts of the colonial army, launched a riot in Algiers, the capital of Algeria. They also held provocative demonstrations in Paris and other parts of France, attempting to take advantage of the chaotic situation to realize a fascist coup plot.

Now, the French Communist Party and forces supporting the democratic republican system are mobilizing the people to thwart the fascist elements' plot to carry out a military coup.

On this day, in Algiers, colonialist fascists, including a group of military personnel, held a demonstration against the rise of the new French Prime Minister, Pflimlin, and against the republican system. Afterwards, they rushed into the office building of the French government's resident minister in Algeria in trucks, smashed the furniture in the building, threw many files and documents out of the windows onto the street, and set fire to some of the documents. In the leaflets they distributed, they accused the current French republican system of being an "outdated system" and clamored to "carry the Algerian colonial war to the end." When they rushed into the building, they frantically shouted fascist slogans: "Algeria is French!" "Long live De Gaulle!" "Let the army take power!"

Some paratrooper units of the French army in the Algerian region, led by paratrooper commander Jacques Massu, participated in the riot. After occupying the government office building and the Algiers radio station, the rioters established a "Committee of Public Safety" with Massu as chairman. Massu immediately sent a telegram to French President Coty, threatening that a "government of public safety" must be established in Paris. At the same time, in a public statement to the demonstrating fascists, he also demanded that De Gaulle come to power to "ensure the permanence of Algeria as an indivisible part of France."

In Paris, several thousand fascists, led by far-right parliamentarian Le Pen, marched on the Champs-Élysées, shouting reactionary slogans along the way: "Throw the parliamentarians into the Seine!" The demonstrators rushed to the Place de la Concorde, across the river from the National Assembly building, and charged the barricades erected by the police on the bridge, clashing with the police and the Republican Guard. Subsequently, several more clashes occurred between the two sides in the Place de la Concorde and neighboring streets. At this time, the National Assembly was discussing the issue of Pflimlin forming a cabinet.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued an appeal regarding the situation in Algeria.

The appeal emphasized the seriousness of the fascist danger and the repeated violations of democratic freedoms by subversives under the protection of official authorities. It called on the working people to immediately hold rallies in various enterprises, and to express their will to defend the republican system and give the subversives a large-scale counterattack in various forms, such as sending delegations, striking, and holding demonstrations.

The Political Bureau instructed the provincial committees, branches, and party groups to establish the necessary contacts with the organizations of the Socialist Party, various republican parties, and alliances, and to organize joint actions of workers and anti-fascist forces.

The Political Bureau called on Parisians to turn the rally scheduled to be held at the Winter Velodrome on the 14th into a large-scale anti-fascist mass demonstration.

The Political Bureau finally put forward the following slogans:

"Immediately dismiss Massu and declare him and the rebels he leads illegal! Dissolve the fascist groups! Fight for a democratic, united government that defends the republican system! The factories, cities, and villages of France unite! All united forces act together to defend the republic and freedom! Down with fascism!"

The French Communist Party is working to organize all those in parliament who support the republican system to take joint action. Duclos, chairman of the Communist Party's parliamentary group, has written to Deixonne, chairman of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group, Dreyfus, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Republican Union of Progress, Daladier, chairman of the parliamentary group of the Radical Socialist Party, and Faure, chairman of the parliamentary group of the "Left Republican Union," reminding them of the danger of the fascist rebellion in Algeria and calling for urgent measures to protect the rule of law, starting with the immediate dismissal of the rebel generals and declaring them illegal.

At the same time, the French National Committee for Resistance to Fascism held a press conference in Paris on the 13th. At the meeting, well-known politicians and social activists unanimously pointed out that all democratic forces in France must unite to jointly counter the increasingly rampant fascists. Raymond Guyot, a member of the French Communist Party, said that many committees have been established in many provinces and cities in France to counter fascist provocations. The "Left Socialist Alliance" also called on all democratic forces to unite and take all means, including a general strike, to defend the republican system.

　　法国法西斯分子在阿尔及尔发动暴乱
    法共号召粉碎军事政变阴谋
    拥护共和制度的党派也呼吁民主力量团结起来
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：巴黎消息：在法国政府危机第二十八天——5月13日，法国极右翼分子勾结部分殖民军队，在阿尔及利亚首府阿尔及尔发动暴乱，他们同时还在巴黎以及法国其他地方举行挑衅性示威，企图乘局势混乱来实现法西斯政变的阴谋。
    现在，法国共产党和拥护民主共和制度的力量正在发动人民起来挫败法西斯分子进行军事政变的阴谋。
    这一天，在阿尔及尔，包括一批军人在内的殖民主义法西斯分子，举行了一次反对法国新总理弗林姆兰上台和反对共和制的示威，随后乘卡车冲进了法国政府阿尔及利亚驻节部长的办公大楼，捣毁了这座建筑物中的家具，把许多档案文件从窗口中扔到街上，并且放火焚烧了一部分文件。他们在散发的传单中指责目前法国的共和政体是
  “过时的制度”，并且叫嚣要把阿尔及利亚殖民战争“进行到底”。他们在冲入大楼时疯狂地喊叫法西斯口号：“阿尔及利亚是法国的！”“戴高乐万岁！”“让军队掌握政权！”
    法国在阿尔及利亚地区的一些伞兵部队在伞兵部队司令雅克·马絮带头下，参加了这次暴乱，暴乱分子在占领了政府办公大楼和阿尔及尔广播电台以后，成立了由马絮担任主席的“救国委员会”。马絮随即打电报给法国总统戈蒂，要胁必须在巴黎成立一个“救国政府”。同时，他在向示威的法西斯分子发表的公报里，还要求戴高乐上台，以“确保作为法兰西不可分割的一部分的阿尔及利亚的永存”。
    在巴黎，几千个法西斯分子，由极右翼议员勒邦引领，在爱丽舍大街上游行，并且沿途高呼反动口号：“把议员们扔到塞纳河里去！”示威者冲到同国民议会大厦隔河相望的团结广场，并且向警察在桥上垒起来的路障冲击，同警察和共和国保安队发生了冲突。随后，在团结广场及邻近的街道上，双方又发生了好几次冲突。这时，国民议会正在讨论弗林姆兰组阁问题。
    法国共产党中央政治局就阿尔及利亚局势发表呼吁书。
    呼吁书着重指出了法西斯的危险和颠覆分子在官方当局庇护下一再侵犯民主自由这种情况的严重性。它号召劳动人民立刻在各企业举行集会，以各种各样的形式，例如派遣代表团、罢工和举行游行示威来表示保卫共和政体的意志，给予颠覆分子以大规模的反击。
    政治局指示各个省委会、支部和党小组同社会党的组织、各共和党派和联盟建立必要的接触，并且组织工人和反法西斯力量的联合行动。
    政治局号召巴黎人把定于14日在冬季赛车场举行的大会变为大规模的反法西斯群众示威游行。
    政治局最后提出以下口号：
    “马上把马絮撤职，并且宣布他和他所领导的叛乱分子为非法！解散法西斯集团！争取一个民主团结和保卫共和政体的政府！法国各工厂、城市和乡村团结起来！为保卫共和国和自由，一切联合力量共同行动！打倒法西斯主义！”
    法国共产党正努力组织议会中一切拥护共和政体的人采取共同行动。共产党议会党团主席杜克洛已经写信给社会党议会党团主席德戴克松、进步共和联盟议会党团主席德雷甫斯、激进社会党议会党团主席达拉第和“左翼共和联盟”议会党团主席富尔等人，提醒他们注意阿尔及利亚的法西斯叛乱的危险，并号召采取紧急措施以保卫法制，首先从立即把叛乱的将军撤职并宣布他们为非法做起。
    同时，法国全国抵抗法西斯委员会13日在巴黎举行记者招待会，著名的政治家和社会活动家在会上一致指出，法国国内一切民主力量必须团结起来共同反击日益猖獗的法西斯分子，法国共产党员雷蒙·居约说，在法国许多省市里，已经成立了许多委员会来反击法西斯的挑衅。“社会主义左翼联盟”也呼吁一切民主力量团结起来，采取包括总罢工在内的一切手段来保卫共和制度。
