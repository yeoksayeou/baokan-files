The current "economic recession" in the United States is a periodic economic crisis. The so-called economic recession is only a phenomenon, and it can only be a manifestation of an economic crisis. Engels pointed out in "The Condition of the Working Class in England" that there are two types of crises: minor crises and major crises, i.e., periodic crises. Judging from the current economic situation in the United States, it can only be the latter, not the former.

I

On what basis is such a conclusion made?

First of all, the current so-called economic recession in the United States is due to the comprehensive and dramatic intensification of the contradiction between production and the market, reaching the point of rupture. It is not like the minor crisis mentioned by Engels, which is caused by some historical characteristics of the regular cycle—which do not always appear in the same way and with the same intensity—and other factors outside the cycle.

When Marx talked about the inevitability of capitalist economic crises, he pointed out, based on the analysis of the basic contradictions of capitalism, that the development of capitalist productive forces is contradictory to capitalist relations of production. The production of surplus value is the direct purpose and motivation of capitalist production. The conditions for bourgeois exploitation are limited by the social productive forces, while the conditions for realization are limited by the proportionality of different production sectors and the social consumption power. In order to extract more surplus value and preserve themselves in competition, the bourgeoisie constantly accumulates and expands the scale of production, and develops the productive forces. However, the anarchic state of social production determined by capitalist private ownership makes it impossible to maintain the balance of production sectors in the production process, and the destruction of this balance will intensify; in particular, in order to strengthen exploitation, the bourgeoisie always tries to limit the consumption power of the working class to the lowest level possible. Marx also pointed out when discussing capital accumulation that it not only makes the working class increasingly relatively and absolutely impoverished, but also makes other vast laboring residents increasingly bankrupt and impoverished. Thus, the conditions for exploitation are inconsistent with the conditions for realization. This inconsistency manifests itself as an imbalance between production and consumption. Production expands, and the productive forces develop, but the market does not expand proportionally. Therefore, periodic economic crises are bound to occur. Through crises, the balance of the capitalist economy is temporarily restored by destroying the productive forces.

From the perspective of the United States, compared with 1939, industrial production increased by 246% in 1957, but personal income did not increase proportionally. Personal income after tax (calculated at 1939 prices) only increased by 212%, mainly because the income of the broad masses of working people was very low. Last year, the average income of American workers was only $4,284, and the wages of hired farmers were only 30% of the average wage of urban workers. According to the Heller Committee, which compiles family budgets in the United States, the cost of living for a wage-earning family in the United States last year was $5,830. This shows that the growth of production is seriously out of step with the improvement of mass consumption capacity.

Secondly, the growth of production in the United States is one-sided. Since the war, the production of military industries and related sectors has grown significantly. In recent years, new construction and equipment replacement in enterprises have developed greatly, while the sectors producing durable consumer goods, housing construction, and new production sectors have developed most prominently. This one-sidedness in the development of productive forces has seriously disrupted the balance between the various sectors of production. This has also been a major cause of economic instability in the United States.

All of these are the basis for the sharpening of the contradiction between production and the market in the American economy itself. The United States has used the certain capacity of the post-war capitalist world market to regulate this sharp contradiction between production and the market, and has adopted economic militarization and a series of other artificial measures. But it has not been able to eliminate the sharpness of this contradiction. From 1950 to 1957, the production capacity of American manufacturing increased by 51%, while output only increased by 28% during the same period, which is precisely a reflection of this sharp contradiction. At present, this contradiction is accumulating deeper and deeper, and has become comprehensively dramatic and reached the point of rupture. This is reflected in the comprehensive and sharp decline in the operating rate of manufacturing. It fell to 82% last September, 71% this January, 70% in February, and further to below 70% in March and April. In particular, the situation in the heavy industry sector is serious, with the machine tool manufacturing industry only at 56%, and the steel industry at less than 50%. This is much more serious than in 1948-1949 and 1953-1954. The lowest point of the operating rate in 1949 was 80%, and the lowest point in 1954 was 82%. Reflected in the market is the gradual decline in investment and retail sales. The annual rate of investment in the third quarter of 1957 was $377.5 billion, the highest peak since the war. It fell to $362.3 billion in the fourth quarter, and $340.5 billion in the first quarter of this year, a 10% decrease from the peak. According to official U.S. estimates, total investment for the whole year will fall to $320 billion this year, a 13% decrease from last year. The retail trade volume has gradually decreased from the highest figure of $17 billion last August to $16.2 billion this February. If the factor of price increases is taken into account, the actual decrease will be even greater. Investment is the main foundation for economic rise, and retail sales are a direct reflection of personal consumption. Their serious situation comprehensively reflects the seriousness of the market situation in the United States. These situations fully demonstrate that the contradiction between production and the market in the United States has been comprehensively intensified and reached the point of rupture, and that the economy must be temporarily rebalanced by destroying production. This is the essence of the current so-called economic recession in the United States.

Second, the current so-called economic recession in the United States is closely related to the renewal of fixed capital. This is also a basic characteristic of periodic crises.

When Marx talked about the material basis of the cyclical nature of economic crises, he pointed out that the material basis of the cyclical nature of crises is the turnover cycle of about ten years caused by the renewal of fixed capital. He said: "A cycle formed by several interconnected turnovers over several years (capital is bound by this cycle because it has fixed components) has given a material basis to the periodic crisis. In the periodic crisis, business must successively go through the stagnation period, the relatively active period, the over-excited period, and the crisis period. It is true that the time of capital investment is extremely different and dispersed. But the crisis is often the starting point of large-scale new investment. Therefore, from a social perspective, it is more or less the new material basis for the next turnover cycle."

In the crisis, due to the bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises, large-scale capital concentration is caused, and capitalists want to obtain huge profits under the condition of falling prices, which promotes large-scale renewal of fixed capital. Therefore, Marx said that the crisis is the starting point of large-scale new investment. Huge fixed capital investment will expand the market for means of production, promote the production of means of production, and at the same time, due to the increase in employed workers, it will also expand the consumer market and promote the production of means of subsistence. This will temporarily allow the capitalist economy to get rid of the crisis and move from depression to recovery and prosperity. However, large-scale fixed capital renewal will also increase productivity and promote overproduction, and when this investment declines from its peak, it will further shrink the market that has been expanded by it. In this way, the contradiction between production and the market is intensified, which in turn promotes the outbreak of new crises. Therefore, Marx said, "more or less the material basis for the next turnover cycle."

Periodic economic crises, on the one hand, use the method of destroying production to temporarily restore the balance of the capitalist economy; on the other hand, they become the starting point for new large-scale investment. In this regard, World War II actually played the role of a serious periodic crisis. It caused severe damage to the production of the capitalist world; at the same time, it became the starting point for large-scale investment in the capitalist world. The total fixed capital investment in the United States from 1946 to 1957 was $305.5 billion, which became an important factor in promoting the economic boom in the United States. In particular, fixed capital investment increased significantly in 1955-1957. The total investment in 1955 was $28.7 billion, $35.1 billion in 1956, and $37 billion in 1957, which was more than 50% higher than the average level of the past ten years. This huge fixed capital investment vigorously drove the American economy to rise after the production decline in 1953-1954. However, by the fourth quarter of 1957, it began to decline. In the first quarter of this year, it fell by 10% from the post-war peak of $377.5 billion in the third quarter of last year. According to official U.S. estimates, it will fall to 20% by the fourth quarter of this year. Such large-scale fixed capital investment, on the one hand, greatly increased productivity, far exceeding the needs of the market (during the so-called prosperity period of 1955-1957, the operating rate of enterprises was only 82% to 92%), exacerbating overproduction; on the other hand, because its climax has passed, the market originally expanded for it has suddenly shrunk. This intensifies the contradiction between production and the market. Thus, accompanied by the decline in fixed capital investment, the market situation deteriorated, production declined, and the current crisis broke out.

The above arguments and materials have essentially explained that the current so-called economic recession in the United States is a periodic economic crisis. At present, industrial production in the United States is comprehensively and sharply declining. This April, compared with last August, it has fallen by 13.1%, which is close to the rate of decline during the 1929 crisis. At that time, industrial production fell by 13.1% within seven months of the outbreak of the crisis. The total number of unemployed people in April this year was 5.1 million. At present, about 45 to 50 small and medium-sized enterprises go bankrupt every day, creating the highest number since 1939, and these situations are still increasing. These serious facts fully prove that the periodic crisis has broken out in the United States.

II

The argument that denies that a periodic crisis has begun in the United States is untenable. These arguments include the following: (1) It is believed that general economic crises have the characteristics of production decline, worker unemployment, credit crisis, and price decline. However, the United States has not experienced a credit crisis; on the contrary, prices have risen. (2) It is believed that the four periods experienced by periodic crises are not obvious. (3) It is believed that contemporary real capitalist periodic crises are global, and other major capitalist countries have not fallen into such a serious situation as the United States. All these arguments have a common mistake, that is, they are confined to individual phenomena to judge the nature of things, instead of starting from the essence of things. The intensification and even rupture of the contradiction between production and the market determined by the contradiction between capitalist productive forces and relations of production, and the use of methods to destroy production to temporarily restore balance; and its periodic outbreak on the material basis of the capital turnover cycle caused by fixed capital renewal. This is the essence of periodic crises. As for individual non-essential phenomena, they will change under different conditions. Each crisis will have its own characteristics. In the period of monopoly capitalism, especially in the period of the general crisis of capitalism, periodic crises must have different characteristics than those manifested in the 19th century. The preparation and impact of World War II, the formation of the socialist world market, and the collapse of the colonial system, as well as the development of state capitalism and the implementation of national economic militarization in imperialist countries. All of these cannot but affect the development forms and characteristics of periodic crises. Therefore, if we ignore all historical conditions and uniformly use the characteristics manifested by the periodic crises of 19th-century capitalism to judge the nature of today's capitalist crises, we will inevitably make mistakes. Conversely, if we take these new historical conditions into account, then the previous doubts about the current economic crisis in the United States can be easily explained.

(1) Regarding the issue of no credit crisis and rising prices. This is a phenomenon caused by the high development of monopoly capitalism and state capitalism. Due to the high development of state capitalism and the close combination of bank credit and state credit, after the crisis begins, there will be no monetary famine, lack of loan capital, high interest rates, bank closures, and sharp declines in securities. The pressure of the crisis on finance is first reflected in inflation and fiscal crisis. The current inflation in the United States is quite serious, and the U.S. dollar has depreciated by 50%. The fiscal crisis is also latent. The national debt is as high as $275 billion, and the fiscal deficit has reached $3 billion. In addition, it must be seen that the total private consumption and residential mortgage debt in the United States is $200.8 billion, and the corporate debt is $215.5 billion. This huge debt itself contains a credit crisis. The current large-scale bankruptcy of small and medium-sized enterprises is a sign of a credit crisis. Due to the high development of monopoly capitalism, in order to reduce losses in the crisis and transfer this loss to the working people, it can temporarily use monopoly prices to raise prices. At the same time, due to the existence of inflation, although the crisis has occurred, the existence of the phenomenon that prices temporarily still rise is not surprising. The serious decline in production and worker unemployment are essential phenomena of the crisis. And these are serious in the United States at present, which is enough to show that the periodic crisis has begun.

(2) Regarding the issue that the four periods of the crisis cycle are not very significant. The characteristics of the periods experienced by the crisis cycle are also not constant under any circumstances. After the 1929-1933 crisis that broke out in the first stage of the general crisis when capitalism entered, due to the fact that capitalist countries did not have any large-scale fixed capital renewal, a special depression appeared, and prosperity never returned. Then the 1937-1938 crisis broke out again. After World War II, due to the results of the war, large-scale fixed capital investment and a large demand for replenishment of consumer goods became the main material basis for the prosperity of the capitalist world economy. The U.S. economy mainly relies on the conditions of the post-war capitalist world market created by the war (although the United States was not damaged during the war, the renewal of fixed capital and the satisfaction of the demand for consumer goods were suppressed due to the war), plus national economic militarization and the Korean War and other artificial measures such as expanding credit, has obtained a longer period of growth; so that several production declines can be temporarily resolved more quickly and restore so-called prosperity. This is the background for the insignificant four cycle periods in the current U.S. crisis development. But this is not enough to prevent the outbreak of a real periodic economic crisis in the United States first when the basic completion of the fixed capital renewal and the satisfaction of the supplementary demand for consumer goods in the capitalist world after the war, and production began to decline.

(3) Regarding the issue of no world crisis. First of all, we must point out that due to the preparation for World War II and its own results, the consistency of the periodic stages of the capitalist world has been destroyed. The 1937-1938 crisis did not become a world crisis. During this period, countries such as Germany, Italy, and Japan, which stepped up preparations for war, did not suffer from the crisis. After the war, the economic conditions of capitalist countries varied greatly due to the different impacts of the war. For example, in 1948-1949, U.S. production declined sharply, but other capitalist countries continued to rise due to the severe damage caused by the war, as well as the "underproduction" caused by the huge investment and supplementary demand for consumer goods that followed. This also shows that the consistency of the world cycle stage has been destroyed. At present, production has begun to decline in the capitalist world after the United States. This shows that the consistency of the destroyed world cycle stage is being restored. But the time of the crisis outbreak will still be different. The place where the contradiction between production and the market is the most tense is where the crisis first breaks out. Naturally, the United States will take the lead in the world crisis. We cannot deny that it is a periodic crisis because the crisis is currently limited to the United States, Canada, and other countries; and recognize that it is a periodic crisis after it sweeps the capitalist world. The nature of things is determined by the internal basis, not by external connections. Periodic crises, even if they occur in one or two countries, should not be denied in nature.

III

The current economic recession in the United States is not only a periodic crisis, but also an extremely profound periodic crisis.

From the perspective of the domestic situation in the United States: this crisis broke out on the basis of the highly developed contradiction between production and the market. The United States was not only not damaged in the war, but on the contrary, its productivity increased by 40%; since the war, although there have been several production declines, each time it has relied on some special factors to overcome them in a short period of time and restore the economic boom. In twenty years, there has not been a serious crisis. The contradiction between production and the market has developed to a high degree of dramatization, so that it is impossible to balance it except by destroying the productive forces. Thus, this crisis broke out. In addition, this crisis broke out after the United States adopted all artificial respiration measures for the economy. The U.S. government has implemented economic militarization with military expenditures of more than 40 billion U.S. dollars per year, and has carried out large-scale public works and expanded consumer credit. Now all these measures to delay the crisis have been transformed into opposites and become factors that aggravate the crisis.

National economic militarization and other artificial measures, on the one hand, artificially provide a market for production development, and provide new technologies (applying military new technologies to production), making production far removed from real market needs and greatly expanding it. On the other hand, due to the implementation of these artificial measures, the people's tax burden has been increased and inflation has been intensified. Eisenhower himself admitted: More than half of U.S. personal income has "flowed into the sewer of high taxes and inflation." Moreover, due to the expansion of consumer credit, the social purchasing power of several years later has been used in advance. This has made the relatively shrinking social purchasing power even smaller. This has intensified the contradiction between production and the market. Due to the above-mentioned circumstances, this crisis in the United States will be extremely profound.

According to general estimates of U.S. productivity, even under normal economic development, it will not be fully utilized until 1960, and some sectors will not be fully utilized until 1965-1970. Moreover, fixed capital has just been renewed and equipped with new technologies. Therefore, it is absolutely impossible to have a large-scale increase in fixed capital investment in the short term. Research materials from the "McGraw-Hill" publishing company in the United States show that fixed capital investment will be reduced year by year in the next four years. In terms of personal consumption, due to the fact that the purchasing power of several years later has been used in advance, private debt reached as high as $200.8 billion by the end of last year, plus the sharp increase in unemployment and the existence of inflation, there will be absolutely no improvement in the short term. As for the U.S. government taking artificial measures, it has reached a very high limit in the past, and the role it can play in the crisis will be extremely limited. All of these artificial measures ultimately fall on inflation and the financial burden. Carrying out smaller-scale measures is not enough to save the situation; carrying out large-scale measures will worsen inflation, trigger a fiscal crisis, and plunge the economy into a greater collapse. Therefore, this crisis in the United States will be long-lasting.

From the perspective of the international environment, this crisis broke out on the basis that capitalism has entered the second stage of the general crisis. As mentioned earlier, the 1929-1933 crisis was caused by the outbreak on the basis of the first stage of the general crisis, so that after the crisis, there was no large amount of fixed capital renewal, which led to a special depression. After World War II, capitalism entered the second stage of the general crisis. The socialist world market has been formed, and the colonial system has collapsed, and the capitalist world market is narrower than it was in 1929-1933. But during this period, because many parts of the capitalist world were affected by the war, there was a huge investment in fixed capital and a demand for replenishment of consumer goods, which has been the main condition for the long-term rise (although there has been a short-term decline) of the capitalist economy since the war. Now the economy is declining universally in the capitalist world. As the U.S. crisis develops, other capitalist countries will inevitably be involved, indicating that this condition no longer exists. And today's world situation is more unfavorable to capitalism than it was in 1929-1933. Therefore, it will be more difficult for the capitalist world to get out of the crisis than it was in 1929-1933.

In short, even if the crisis is due to the high development of state capitalism, and the state takes a number of anti-crisis measures, the development of the crisis may be slower than in 1929-1933, but in terms of depth and persistence, it may exceed the crisis of 1929-1933, and getting rid of the crisis will be more difficult than after 1929-1933. This crisis will be a turning point in the development of the post-war capitalist world.

    美国已开始了周期性的经济危机
    顾崇实
    目前美国的“经济衰退”，乃是周期性的经济危机。所谓经济衰退，只是就现象而言，它只能是经济危机的表现。恩格斯在英国劳动阶级的现状中曾指出危机有次要危机与主要危机即周期性危机两种。从美国当前的经济情况来看，只能是后者，而不能是前者。
    一
    根据什么作出这样的论断呢？
    首先，美国当前的所谓经济衰退，乃是由于生产与市场的矛盾全面剧化，达到破裂的程度而发生的。而不是像恩格斯所说的那种次要的危机那样，是由于规律性周期的某种——决不是一直以同样方式和同样强度出现的——历史特点，和周期以外其他发生作用的因素而引起的。
    马克思在谈到资本主义经济危机的必然性时，在分析资本主义基本矛盾的基础上，指出资本主义生产力的发展是与资本主义生产关系矛盾的。剩余价值的生产，是资本主义生产的直接目的和动机。资产阶级剥削的条件是受限制于社会生产力，而实现的条件，则受限制于不同各生产部门的比例性与社会的消费力。资产阶级为了要榨取更多的剩余价值，并在竞争中保存自己，不断地积累扩大生产规模，发展生产力，但资本主义私人所有制决定的社会生产无政府状态，使生产过程中生产各部门的平衡，经常不能保持，并且这种平衡的破坏会激化；特别是资产阶级为了加强剥削，总是尽可能地把工人阶级的消费力限制在最低限度。马克思还在谈资本积累时指出，资本积累不仅使工人阶级日益相对贫困化和绝对贫困化，并使其他广大劳动居民日益破产贫困。这样剥削条件便和实现条件不一致。这种不一致，便表现为生产同消费不平衡，生产扩大了，生产力发展了，但市场不会按比例扩大。因此，就必然要发生周期性的经济危机。经过危机，用破坏生产力的办法，来暂时地恢复资本主义经济的平衡。
    从美国的情况来看，1957年同1939年相比，工业生产增长了246％，但个人的收入是不与此按同比例增长的，纳税后的个人收入（按1939年物价计算）只增长了212％，主要是广大劳动人民的收入很少。去年美国工人的平均收入，只有四千二百八十四美元，雇农的工资仅为城市工人中等工资的30％。据美国编制家庭预算的海勒委员会估计，去年美国一个靠工资生活的家庭维持生活的费用要五千八百三十美元。这说明生产增长与群众消费能力的提高，是严重脱节的。
    其次，美国的生产的增长是片面的。大战以来，主要是军事工业及与此有关的部门的生产有很大的增长。近几年新建筑和企业更换设备有很大发展，而以生产耐用消费品的部门，住宅建筑部门，和新的生产部门发展得最为突出。这种生产力发展的片面性，严重的破坏了生产各部门间的平衡。这也曾是美国经济不稳定性的主要原因。
    所有这些，乃是美国生产与市场矛盾尖锐化在美国经济本身中的根据。美国对这尖锐的生产与市场矛盾，曾利用战后资本主义世界市场存在着一定的容量，来加以调节，并采用了经济军事化，和其他一系列的人为措施。但并未能消除这种矛盾的尖锐性。自1950—1957年，美国制造业生产能力增长51％，而同期产量仅增加了28％，正是这矛盾尖锐的反映。目前这矛盾愈积愈深，已全面剧化而达于破裂。这表现在生产方面的是制造业开工率全面剧烈下降。去年9月下降到82％，今年1月降到71％，2月则为70％，3、4月份更下降到70％以下。特别是重工业部门情况严重，机床制造业仅及56％，钢铁工业还不到50％。这比1948—1949年和1953—1954年远为严重。1949年开工率的最低点是80％，1954年的最低点是82％。表现在市场方面的是，投资和零售都逐步下降。1957年第三季投资年率为三百七十七点五亿美元，是战后的最高峰。第四季度降为三百六十二点三亿美元，今年第一季度降为三百四十点五亿美元，较高峰下降10％。据美国官方估计，今年全年投资将降为三百二十亿美元，较去年下降13％。零售贸易额从去年8月一百七十亿美元的最高数字，逐步下降，到今年2月为一百六十二亿美元。如将物价上涨因素估计在内，实际下降数还要大。投资是经济上升的主要基础，零售是个人消费的直接反映。它们这种严重的情况，就全面地反映了美国市场情况的严重。这些情况，充分说明了美国生产与市场的矛盾已全面激化而达于破裂，要以破坏生产的办法来使经济暂时恢复平衡。这就是美国当前所谓经济衰退的实质。
    第二，美国当前的所谓经济衰退，是与固定资本更新有着密切联系的。这也是周期性危机的基本特点。
    马克思谈到经济危机周期性的物质基础时，他曾指出：危机周期性的物质基础，是固定资本更新所引起的十年左右一次的周转循环。他说：“若干互相联系的周转，在若干年内形成的循环（资本因有固定成分，才被拘束在这个循环内），曾为周期的危机，给予一个物质基础。在周期的危机中，营业要依次通过停滞时期，相当活跃时期，过度激动时期，危机时期。不错的，资本投下的时间，是极相异的，分散的。但危机往往是大规模新投资的始点。所以，就社会考察，那又多少是下一周转循环的新的物质基础。”
    在危机中，由于中小企业倒闭，造成资本大规模集中，以及资本家要在物价下跌情况下，获得厚利，便促成固定资本大规模的更新。所以马克思说，危机是大规模新投资的始点。巨大的固定资本投资，就会扩大生产资料的市场，促进生产资料生产，同时由于就业工人增加，又会扩大消费市场，促进生活资料的生产。这样就使资本主义经济暂时摆脱危机，由萧条走向复苏和繁荣。但大规模的固定资本更新，又会使生产力提高而促进生产过剩，并且当这种投资由高峰下降时，更会使由于它而扩大的市场骤然缩小。这样，就加剧了生产与市场的矛盾，反过来促成新的危机的爆发。所以马克思说，“多少是下一周转循环的物质基础”。
    周期性的经济危机一方面用破坏生产的办法，来暂时恢复资本主义经济的平衡；同时又成为新的大规模投资的始点。在这方面，第二次世界大战实际上起着一次严重的周期性危机的作用。它使资本主义世界的生产遭受了激烈的破坏；同时，又成为资本主义世界大规模投资的始点。美国战后从1946—1957年固定资本投资总额为三千零五十五亿美元，成为推动美国经济高涨的重要因素。特别是在1955—1957年固定资本投资有很大的增长，1955年投资总额为二百八十七亿美元，1956年为三百五十一亿美元，1957年为三百七十亿美元，较过去十年平均水平高出50％以上。这巨大的固定资本投资，在1953—1954年生产下降后，曾有力地带动美国经济上升。但至1957年第四季度，便开始下降，到今年第一季度较去年第三季度三百七十七点五亿美元的战后高峰下降10％，按美国官方的估计推算，至今年第四季度将下降到20％。这样大规模的固定资本投资，一方面大大地增长了生产力，远远超出了市场的需要，（在1955—1957年所谓繁荣时期，企业开工率只有82％到92％），加剧了生产过剩；另一方面由于它的高潮已过，使原来为它扩大了的市场，顿形缩小。这就使生产与市场的矛盾剧化起来。于是伴随着固定资本投资下降，市场情况恶化，生产下降，爆发了当前的危机。
    上述这些论点与材料，已从本质上说明了美国这次所谓经济衰退，乃是周期性的经济危机。现在美国工业生产正全面地急剧下降，今年4月与去年8月相比，已下降了13.1％，已接近1929年危机的下降速度，当时危机爆发的七个月内，工业生产下降为13.1％。全失业人数到今年4月为五百一十万人。目前中小企业每天约有四十五到五十家倒闭，创1939年以来最高数字，这些情况还在有增无已。这种严重的事实，也完全证明了周期性的危机，已在美国爆发。
    二
    否认目前在美国已经开始了周期性的危机的论点是站不住的。这些论点有以下这些：（一）认为：一般经济危机都有生产下降、工人失业、信用危机、物价下跌等特征。而美国目前并未出现信用危机；物价反而上涨。（二）认为：周期性危机所经历的四个时期并不明显。（三）认为：当代真正的资本主义周期性的危机是世界性的，目前其他主要资本主义国家并未陷入美国那样的严重情况。所有这些论点，有着一个共同的错误，就是拘泥于个别现象，来判断事物的性质，而不从事物的本质出发。由于资本主义的生产力与生产关系的矛盾所决定的生产与市场的矛盾的激化，乃至破裂，采用破坏生产的办法，以暂时恢复平衡；并且它是在固定资本更新所引起的资本周转循环的物质基础上周期地爆发。这乃是周期性危机的本质。至于个别非本质的现象，在不同条件下，是会有变化的。每次危机都会有它自己的特点的。在垄断资本主义时期，特别是在资本主义总危机时期，周期性的危机必然较十九世纪时期所表现的特点有所不同。第二次世界大战的准备和影响，社会主义世界市场的形成，和殖民体系的瓦解，以及帝国主义国家的国家资本主义的发展和国民经济军事化的实施。所有这些，都不能不影响周期性危机的发展形式和特点。因此，如果无视一切历史条件，一律用十九世纪资本主义周期性危机所表现的特征，来判断今天的资本主义危机的性质，必然会发生错误。反之，如果我们考虑到这些新的历史条件，那末前面对美国当前的经济危机发生怀疑的看法，便不难说明。
    （一）关于没有发生信用危机和物价上涨问题。这乃是由于垄断资本主义与国家资本主义高度发展所产生的现象。由于国家资本主义高度发展，银行信用与国家信用的密切结合，在危机开始后，不会跟着出现货币饥荒，借贷资本缺乏，利息率高涨，银行倒闭，有价证券暴跌等现象。危机加在金融上的压力，首先反映在通货膨胀与财政危机上。美国目前通货膨胀已相当严重，美元贬值50％。财政危机也已潜伏存在。国债高达二千七百五十亿美元，财政赤字已达三十亿美元。此外，还须看到，美国私人消费与住宅抵押债务总计二千零八亿美元，公司债务为二千一百五十五亿美元，这庞大的债务本身，就蕴藏着信用危机。目前大规模中小企业倒闭，也就是信用危机的一种迹象。由于垄断资本主义高度发展，它为了减少在危机中的损失，并将这种损失转嫁到劳动人民身上去，暂时能够用垄断价格抬高物价。同时又因有通货膨胀的情况存在，因而虽然危机已经发生，但物价暂时仍然上涨这种现象的存在，是不足为奇的。生产的严重下降，工人失业，乃是危机本质的现象。而这些目前在美国是严重的，这就足以表明周期性的危机已经开始。
    （二）关于危机的周期的四个时期不很显著问题。危机的周期所经过的时期的特点，也不是在任何情况下不变的，在资本主义进入总危机的第一阶段所爆发的1929—1933年的危机以后，由于资本主义国家没有出现任何大规模的固定资本更新，曾出现特种萧条，繁荣逝而不返。接着便又爆发了1937—1938年的危机。第二次世界大战后，由于战争结果，带来了大规模的固定资本投资和大量的消费品的补足需求，成为战后资本主义世界经济繁荣的主要的物质基础。美国经济主要依靠这种由战争所造成的战后资本主义世界市场的条件（美国在战时虽未遭受破坏，但固定资本更新和消费资料的需求的满足曾因战争而受到积压），再加上国民经济军事化和朝鲜战争和其他人为措施如扩大信贷等，获得了较长时期的增长；使几次的生产下降，得以较快地暂时解决，恢复所谓繁荣。这就是美国目前危机发展的四个周期时期不显著的背景。但这并不足以妨碍在资本主义世界战后固定资本更新基本完成和消费品补足需求得到满足，生产开始下降的时候，在美国首先爆发一次真正的周期性的经济危机。
    （三）关于没有发生世界危机问题。首先我们要指出：由于第二次世界大战的准备及其本身的结果，资本主义世界的周期阶段的一致性已遭到破坏。1937—1938年危机就没有成为世界性的危机。在这个时期里加紧备战的德国、意大利、日本等国都没有遭到危机。战后，资本主义各国因受战争的影响不同，经济情况差别较大。如1948—1949年美国生产严重下降，但其他资本主义国家则因战争激烈破坏，以及跟着而来的巨大投资和消费品补足需求所引起的“生产不足”的情况存在，经济仍然继续上升。这也表明世界周期阶段的一致性的被破坏。目前资本主义世界随着美国之后，生产都已开始下降。这说明已被破坏的世界周期阶段的一致性正在恢复。但危机爆发的时间仍然是会有先后的。生产与市场矛盾最紧张的地方，乃是危机首先爆发的所在。自然美国是要在世界危机中一马当先。我们不能因为危机目前还只限于在美国加拿大等国爆发，就不认为它是周期性的危机；等它席卷资本主义世界后，才承认它是周期性危机。事物的性质，是决定于内在的根据，不是决定于外在的联系。周期性危机纵然在一两个国家发生，也不应在性质上否认它。
    三
    美国当前的经济衰退，不仅是周期性的危机，并且还是一次极为深刻的周期性的危机。
    从美国国内情况来看：这次危机是在生产与市场的矛盾高度发展的基础上爆发的。美国在大战中不仅没有遭到破坏，相反地生产力增长了40％；战后到现在虽有几次生产下降，但每次都是依靠一些特殊因素在短时期内被克服，恢复了经济的高涨。在二十年内，没有经过一次严重的危机。生产与市场的矛盾，已发展到高度的剧化的程度，以致除了用破坏生产力的办法已无法平衡。从而爆发了这次危机。加之，这次危机是在美国对经济采用了一切人工呼吸的措施之后爆发的。美国政府曾以每年高达四百多亿美元的军事费用来实行经济军事化，并大规模举办公共工程和扩大消费信贷。现在这一切延缓危机的措施都转化为对立物，成为加重危机的因素。
    国民经济军事化和其他人为措施，一方面人为地给生产发展提供市场，并提供了新的技术（将军事上的新技术运用到生产上来），使生产远远地脱离真实的市场需要而大大地扩张起来。另一方面，由于实行这些人为措施，加重了人民赋税负担，加剧了通货膨胀。艾森豪威尔自己也承认：美国个人收入有一半以上已经“流入高额的赋税和通货膨胀的下水道里去了”。更因扩大消费信贷，若干年后的社会购买力已被提前使用了。这便使相对缩小的社会购买力倍加缩小。这就使生产与市场的矛盾倍加剧化。由于上面这些情况，美国这次危机将是极为深刻的。
    美国生产力据一般估计，就是在经济正常发展的情况下也要到1960年，有些部门甚至要到1965—1970年，才能被充分地利用起来，而固定资本是刚刚更新的，是采用新的技术装备起来的。因此，短时期内绝不可能再有大规模上升的固定资本投资。美国“麦克格劳·希尔”出版公司的调查材料说，固定资本投资，在今后四年内，还要逐年缩减。个人消费方面，由于若干年后的购买力已被提前使用，私人负债在去年年底已达二千零八亿美元之巨，再加上失业剧增与通货膨胀的情况存在，短时期内也绝不会有什么起色。至于美国政府采取人为措施，过去已达到很高限度，在危机中能发生的作用将是极为有限的。所有这一切的人为措施，归根到底都落到通货膨胀和财政负担上面来。较小规模的进行，不足挽狂澜于既倒；大规模的进行，则将使通货膨胀恶化，财政危机爆发，而陷经济于更大的崩溃。因此，美国这次危机将是持久的。
    从国际环境来看，这次危机是在资本主义已经进入总危机的第二阶段的基础上爆发的。前面已经提到，1929—1933年的危机因是在总危机的第一阶段的基础上爆发的，以致危机之后，没有任何大量的固定资本更新，从而出现了特种萧条。第二次大战后，资本主义进入总危机的第二阶段，社会主义世界市场已经形成，并且殖民体系瓦解，资本主义的世界市场比1929—1933年时是更加狭窄了。但这时期，因为许多资本主义世界受战争的影响，从而存在着巨大的固定资本投资与消费品的补足需求的情况，这曾是战后以来资本主义经济长时期上升（虽然有短时期的下降）的主要条件。现在资本主义世界普遍经济下降。美国危机发展下去，其他资本主义国家势必卷入，说明这一条件已不存在。而今天的世界形势比1929—1933年时对资本主义更不利了。因此，资本主义世界要从危机中摆脱出来，将比1929—1933年时要更加困难。
    总之，这次危机纵然由于国家资本主义的高度发展，国家采取若干的反危机的措施，危机发展开始可能比1929—1933年的要缓慢些，但在深刻与持久上，可能会超过1929—1933年的危机，摆脱危机将比1929—1933年之后的情况要更为困难。这次危机，将是战后资本主义世界发展的一个转折点。
