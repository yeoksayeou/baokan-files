Guizhou's Agricultural Production Rises Year After Year

(Our newspaper's Guiyang dispatch, May 27th) Guizhou Province is using "early, deep, fertilizer, dense, and reform" as its action program for this year's spring plowing production, setting off an unprecedentedly high-spirited production movement. The so-called "early, deep, fertilizer, dense, and reform" specifically refers to: striving to sow early, without violating the farming season; deep plowing and meticulous cultivation; rational fertilization and year-round manure accumulation; universal promotion of dense planting experience for rice, corn, and other crops; and improving the cultivation system, cultivation techniques, and tools.

Now, from the perspective of the entire province, paddy fields have basically achieved three plowings and three harrowings or four plowings and four harrowings; in terms of fertilization, the base fertilizer for paddy fields generally reaches more than 10,000 jin per mu; the sowing time has generally been advanced by about half a month; the corn and rice sown in various places have mostly implemented dense planting; there has also been some progress in reforming tools; in addition, more than 5 million mu of low-yield fields have been transformed.

In improving the cultivation system and technology, the achievements in the deep mountain ethnic minority areas are the most significant. In the Masha Mountain area bordering Ziyun, Wangmo, and Luodian counties in the Qiannan Buyi and Miao Autonomous Prefecture, base fertilizer was never applied during spring sowing in the past. This year, 24,000 jin of base fertilizer are applied per mu of corn, which is twelve times the amount of fertilizer applied per mu for the entire year last year. Dushan, Luodian, Duyun and other counties have begun to change the cultivation system of only planting one season of rice and plan to promote 100,000 mu of double-cropping rice this year.

Before liberation, agricultural production in Guizhou Province was very backward. For thousands of years, the ethnic minorities in the deep mountain areas had been using the primitive production methods of "slash-and-burn cultivation, relying on the mountains for food," maintaining an extremely impoverished life. By the time of liberation in 1949, the total grain output of the province was only more than 5.9 billion jin, with an average of only 300 jin of grain per person in the province. After liberation, party committees and people's governments at all levels actively led farmers of all ethnic groups to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and vigorously supported farmers of all ethnic groups in developing agricultural production economically and technically. By last year, the total grain output of the province had jumped to 10.6 billion jin, and farmers had an average of nearly 600 jin of grain per person. (Wu Zhenquan)

    贵州农业生产连年上升
    本报贵阳27日电　贵州省以早、深、肥、密、改当作今年春耕生产的行动纲领，掀起了空前高涨的生产运动。所谓早、深、肥、密、改，具体来说就是：力争提早播种，不违农时；深耕细作；合理施肥，常年积肥；普遍推广水稻、玉米等密植经验；改进耕作制度、耕作技术，改进工具。
    现在从全省范围看，水田犁耙基本上作到了三犁三耙或四犁四耙；在施肥上，水田的底肥普遍达到一万斤以上；播种时间一般提早了半月左右；各地播种的玉米、水稻大都实行了密植；改革工具也有一定的成绩；此外还改造低产田五百多万亩。
    在改进耕作制度和技术上，深山民族地区的成绩最显著。黔南布依族苗族自治州紫云、望谟、罗甸三县接壤的麻山地区，过去春播从来不施底肥，今年玉米每亩施底肥二万四千斤，等于去年全年每亩施肥量的十二倍。独山、罗甸、都匀等县，开始改变只种一季稻的耕作制度，计划今年推广十万亩双季稻。
    贵州省解放前，农业生产很落后。深山地区千百年来一直沿用着“刀耕火种、赶山吃饭”的原始生产方法，维持极其贫困的生活。到1949年解放时，全省粮食总产量只有五十九亿多斤，平均全省每人只有粮三百斤。解放后各级党委和人民政府积极领导各族农民走互助合作道路，从经济上和技术上大力支援各族农民发展农业生产。到去年，全省粮食总产量已跃进到一百零六亿斤，农民平均每人有粮近六百斤。　（吴振全）
