    Help or Accusation
    Mu Yang

    "One can boost morale, but not let it deflate," this is an important leadership method. This means that when subordinates and the masses are full of energy and have made great achievements in their work, they should naturally be praised and not specifically nitpicked; even if the targets they propose are too high and temporarily unattainable, or if they suffer repeated failures in their actual work due to incorrect methods, they should be encouraged from a positive perspective, and efforts should be made to help them overcome their shortcomings and do their work well, rather than being excessively blamed or having cold water poured on them, causing them to lose heart. If leading cadres master this method, they can mobilize all positive factors and promote the vigorous and lively progress of all aspects of work.

    During the rectification movement, many leading cadres have already learned this leadership method. A recent example from the Ministry of Railways is a good proof:

    The Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways encountered the following incident when formulating the Great Leap Forward plan: The Ministry of Railways originally stipulated that trains should undergo maintenance and repair every 150 kilometers. During this Great Leap Forward, some Railway Administrations, in order to save manpower, equipment, and increase train speed, extended the interval between two maintenance and repair sessions to more than 500 kilometers, with the longest being 552 kilometers. Doing so would make it difficult to ensure the safety of train operation. After the leaders of the Vehicle Bureau discovered this situation, they summoned comrades from below to conduct on-site inspections and discussions. The inspection and discussion results were: the originally set figure of 150 kilometers was indeed too conservative, but the target of 500 kilometers was too high. Finally, it was determined to be 250 kilometers. In this way, the leadership not only helped everyone revise unrealistic targets but also strengthened their confidence in the Great Leap Forward.

    The approach of the Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways is correct. This is the working method of true Communists. We Communists are dialectical materialists. Taking the issue of plans and targets as an example, we believe that they are guidelines for action; without plans and targets, it is difficult to get things done. However, we must also see that correct targets cannot be formulated all at once. The initial targets may be completely correct, or they may be partially correct, mostly correct with a small part incorrect, or a small part correct with the majority incorrect. Only through repeated practice can they eventually be completely correct. The so-called completely correct is still relative. What is correct now may not be correct after a period of time; what is correct in this place may not be correct in another place. This is because people's understanding often lags behind objective reality, and objective reality is constantly changing. Since this is the case, when some targets are unrealistic or failures are suffered due to incorrect methods, one should not be alarmed, point fingers, make indiscriminate accusations, but should conduct specific analysis, learn lessons, and improve work. Therefore, "one can boost morale, but not let it deflate" is not just a matter of attitude towards subordinates and the masses, but also an issue of epistemology and methodology.

    是帮助还是指责
    木扬
    “气可鼓而不可泄”，这是一条重要的领导方法。这就是说，当下级和群众的干劲十足，工作很有成绩的时候，固然应该给予表扬，不要专门去挑岔子；就是他们提出的指标数字过高而暂时无法实现，或者在实际工作中因为方法不对而遭受多次失败的时候，也应该从积极方面给予鼓励，努力帮助他们克服缺点，作好工作，而不要作过分的责备，不要泼冷水，使人泄气。领导干部掌握了这条方法，就能调动一切积极因素，推动各方面的工作朝气勃勃轰轰烈烈地前进。
    整风运动中，很多领导干部已经学会了这条领导方法。举最近铁道部的一个例子，就是很好的证明：
    铁道部车辆局在制定跃进计划的时候，发生这样一件事：铁道部原来规定列车行走一百五十公里后进行一次检修。在这次跃进中，有的管理局为了节省人员、设备和提高行车速度，把两次检修时间延长到五百公里以上，最长的是五百五十二公里。这样做，就很难保证行车的安全。车辆局领导上发现这个情况后，就召集下边同志到现场进行检查和讨论。检查和讨论结果是：原定一百五十公里的数字确是太保守，但是五百公里的指标又太高，最后确定为二百五十公里。这样领导上既帮助大家修正了不切合实际的指标，又增强了跃进的信心。
    铁道部车辆局的作法是正确的，这是真正的共产党人的工作方法。我们共产党人是辩证唯物论者，以对待计划和指标这类问题而论，我们一方面认为它们是行动的方针，没有计划和指标，就不好办事。但是，也必须看到，正确的指标，并不是一下就能够制订出来的，最初的指标，可能完全正确，也可能不完全正确，可能大部分正确，小部分不正确，也可能小部分正确，大部分不正确。只有经过反复实践，最后才能完全正确。所谓完全正确，也还是相对的，现在是正确的，过一个时期未必正确，在这个地方是正确的，在另一个地方未必正确。这是因为人的认识往往落后于客观实际，客观实际又是在不断地变化着的。既然如此，当发生某些指标不切合实际或者因方法不对而遭受失败的时候，就不应该大惊小怪，指手划脚，乱加指责，并应该进行具体分析，接受教训，改进工作。因此，“气可鼓而不可泄”，绝不只是对待下级和群众的态度问题，同时也是一个认识论和方法论的问题。
