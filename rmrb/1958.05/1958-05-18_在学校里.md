    At School
　　National Rice Production Model Worker Chen Yongkang
    Lectures at Jiangsu Normal College
    Recently, Jiangsu Normal College invited the famous national rice production model worker Chen Yongkang to give a scientific report on rice production experience to all teachers and students of the college. This is the second scientific lecture held by the college this year. This lecture was held to meet the needs of all teachers and students for agricultural production knowledge.
    Chen Yongkang introduced his rice planting experience in detail and described the current situation of rural areas striving for high yields. The teachers and students of the college gained a lot after listening to this lecture, and everyone realized the significance of combining science and practice.
    Establish an Experimental Farm
    Recently, Gu Zhang Junior High School in Hunan Province established a "Gu Zhang Junior High School Experimental Farm" in Yan Ta, located thirty miles away from the city below Gaowangjie. The base of this farm is one thousand mu, and this semester's plan is to reclaim two hundred mu, mainly for planting corn and soybeans.
    School leaders selected one hundred students from four classes in the second grade to go to Yan Ta to start reclamation. Some of the school's teachers also participated, leading production and teaching classes on the mountain.
    The Yan Ta Township Party Committee and the masses solved their accommodation problems and allocated 150 mu of cultivated wasteland, 80 mu of oil tea mountain, and 50 sheep to the school. It is estimated that the students who go to the mountain can be completely self-sufficient in all expenses within the second month.
    The school has established a Communist Youth League general branch here. It also plans to set up night schools and literacy classes here to help agricultural cooperatives eliminate illiteracy.
    Marching to the Orchard
    The campus of Northwest University is full of fruit trees, including apples, peaches, and other varieties, totaling thousands of trees. However, in the past, fruit trees suffered from insect infestations every year, and there were countless insect bags around the Qingming Festival. So many fruit trees not only failed to increase production for the country at that time, but also caused losses. However, the teachers and students of the biology department rarely paid attention to this matter. During the rectification, the school leaders handed over the orchard to the school's biology department.
    During the "Double-Anti" movement, the red and expert great debate made all teachers and students of the department clear that teaching must be combined with production practice. Now, the teachers and students of the biology department have fertilized, irrigated, and removed pests from the fruit trees, and planted various vegetables in the open spaces on the campus. Whenever they have free time, they concentrate the entire department's efforts to remove insect bags and weeds from the ground, striving for the first harvest for the orchard this year. A greater gain lies in the fact that teachers and students have gained a lot of knowledge in labor that cannot be obtained in the classroom. Professor Zhang Jianshi, who is nearly sixty years old and has white hair, talked to the students about his feelings after a fruit orchard labor, saying: Without holding a hoe and sweating, you will not be able to better transform yourself. The students have also greatly consolidated and improved their classroom knowledge through labor. (Luo Zhiteng)
    Both Civil and Military
    More than one hundred students from Wuhan Medical College were transporting stones at Hanbei Wharf. In six and a half hours of intense labor, they carried more than one hundred and twenty tons of stones from the ship, climbed over the embankment, and transported them to a place five or six hundred meters away from the ship. Because of their good work attitude, they quickly completed the task. The workers praised them one after another, saying: Today's college students are truly "both civil and military," and are good students who can both study and work! (Fang Ziyou)
    Successful Trial Production of Artificial Cotton
    In the upsurge of "diligence and thrift in running schools," good news came from Changsha No. 15 Middle School (Girls' Middle School): After a month of small-scale experiments, the school successfully produced artificial cotton using ramie velvet, straw, kudzu vine, paper mulberry bark, waste sacks, waste hemp ropes, and waste cotton. Among them, the artificial cotton made of ramie velvet can be spun into yarn after preliminary inspection. The fiber is longer, thinner, and softer than the original cotton, and the tensile strength is also very good. It can be used to make cotton wadding. The recovery rate of the finished product is generally around 50%-60%, except for straw, which is about 30%. The cost of each jin of ramie velvet artificial cotton is one yuan to one yuan and two jiao. Mass production can further reduce the cost. The cost of artificial cotton made of straw and other materials is even lower.

    在学校里
　　全国水稻丰产劳模陈永康
    到江苏师范学院讲学
    江苏师范学院最近邀请了著名的全国水稻丰产模范陈永康向全院师生作了水稻丰产经验的科学报告。这是这个学院今年举办的第二次科学讲座。这次讲座是为了满足全院师生对农业生产知识的需要而举办的。
    陈永康详尽地介绍了他的水稻种植经验，讲述了目前农村力争高产的面貌。该院师生听了这次讲座后收获很大，大家认识到科学和实际相结合的意义。
    办实验农场
    湖南省古丈初级中学最近在距城三十里的高望界下面的岩它，建立了一个“古丈初中实验农场”。这个农场的基地是一千亩，这学期计划开荒二百亩，以种包谷、黄豆为主。
    学校领导从二年级四个班的学生中挑选出一百人，先到岩它进行开垦，学校的老师也有一部分参加，在山上领导生产和上课。
    岩它乡党委和群众为他们解决了住宿问题，并给学校调拨了熟荒地一百五十亩、油茶山八十亩和羊五十头。估计上山的同学在第二个月内，一切费用可以全部自给。
    学校在这里成立了共青团总支。还计划在这里设立夜校和识字班，帮助农业社扫盲。
    向果园进军
    西北大学的校园里果树成林，有苹果、桃等数种，共计上千棵。可是以前果树年年闹虫灾，每当清明前后，虫包多得不得了。这么多的果树，当时不但不能为国家增产，反而赔累。而生物系师生很少过问此事。整改时学校领导把果园交给该校生物系。
    “双反”运动中，红专大辩论使全系师生都明确到教学必须结合生产实践。现在，生物系师生已给果树施肥、灌溉、除虫，并在校园空地上种下了各种蔬菜。一有空就集中全系力量除虫包、除地里的杂草，争取今年为果园第一次丰收。更大的收入还在于师生在劳动中获得了许多课堂里得不到的知识。年近六十、白发苍苍的张见石教授在一次果园劳动后和同学谈起自己的感触，他说：不拿锄头，不出汗，就不会更好地改造自己。而同学们经过劳动也大大地巩固和提高了课堂知识。（罗志腾）
    文武双全
    武汉医学院有一百多名学生在汉北码头搬运石子，他们在六个半钟头的紧张劳动中，把一百二十多吨石子，从船上挑下来，爬过堤坡，搬运到离船五、六百公尺远的地方，因为他们的劳动态度好，很快地完成了工作任务，工人同志们纷纷地赞扬说：今天的大学生真是“文武双全”，是既能读书又能劳动的好学生！（房自友）
    试制人造棉成功
    在“勤工俭学”热潮中，长沙市第十五中学（女子中学）传出喜讯：该校经过一个月的小规模实验，分别利用麻绒、稻草、葛藤、构树皮、废麻袋、废麻绳、废棉，制成了人造棉。其中麻绒制的人造棉，经初步检验可以弹纺成纱，纤维比原棉长、细、软，拉力也很好，可用它弹成棉絮。成品的收回率，除稻草为30％左右以外，一般都在50％—60％左右。每斤麻绒人造棉的成本为一元到一元二角，以后成批生产还可降低。稻草等制成的人造棉，成本更低。
