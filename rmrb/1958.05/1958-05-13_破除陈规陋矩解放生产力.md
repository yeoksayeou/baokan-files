Break Down Outdated Rules and Regulations to Unleash Productive Forces
Tan Kaifeng, Director of Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory

　　After the great rectification campaign, the political and ideological awareness of the cadres and workers in our factory has been significantly improved. The style of the cadres has changed, the workers' sense of ownership has been strengthened, and thus the relationship between cadres and workers has been greatly improved, and the unity among workers has been greatly enhanced. A lively political situation has emerged throughout the factory, with both unified will and individual ease of mind. A mass-based production upsurge has been launched with this political situation. The broad masses of workers are eager to build socialism quickly, well, and economically, and have put forward the fighting slogan of "One person equals two, one day equals two," launching a socialist great competition of comparing drive and comparing advancement. New production records are constantly appearing, and the original production plans and targets have been repeatedly broken through, modified, and raised five times in a row. Especially after the Double-Anti Movement, the mass upsurge of comparing drive and comparing advancement has been added to by comparing drilling and comparing innovation, and a mass-based technical innovation movement has rapidly taken shape. In the technical innovation movement, the masses are eager to break down those rules and regulations that restrict workers' enthusiasm, creativity, and hinder the development of productive forces. The broad masses, with an overwhelming momentum, adopted the methods of great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters to fiercely attack outdated rules and regulations. The Double-Anti Movement has developed into a technical innovation movement centered on breaking down outdated rules and regulations. So far, the factory has modified 249 of the original 749 rules and regulations, and abolished 196, totaling 59%. Of the 1,927 forms and reports, 993 have been merged, simplified, and abolished, accounting for 51.5%. After the outdated rules and regulations were broken, the masses were overjoyed, applauded, and cheered, their minds became more active, their drive and drilling became greater, and production miracles and initiatives emerged in large numbers, with production efficiency increasing several times, dozens of times, hundreds of times, thousands of times, and even tens of thousands of times. For example, young milling worker Liao Shigang adopted the advanced method of multi-tool, multi-fixture, and multi-machine tool management, and changed milling machine processing to punch press processing, and production increased successively by 1,680 times, completing five years of work in eleven and a half days. Old fitter Zeng Dezhi changed manual operation to mechanical operation, and production increased by 21,243 times at once. The factory has seen an unprecedented number of technical innovators, with 3,681 people increasing production efficiency by more than 50%, accounting for 35% of the factory's workers. The mass-based technical innovation movement is rising one wave after another, making the entire enterprise full of vigorous new atmosphere. The production plan for the first quarter of this year was completed by 128%, an actual increase of 44% compared with the same period last year. If our management work can keep up with the mass leap forward and organize new balances in a timely manner, production results will be even greater.

　　The problems revealed in our factory's anti-conservatism and breaking down outdated rules are quite serious. These rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces are everywhere, manifested in all aspects of enterprise management. For example, the technological authority is over-centralized, and even solving a technical problem requires filling out forms, stamping seals, applying, and passing eight checkpoints. Originally, in a mechanical processing plant, with the development of production, the creation and accumulation of mass practical experience, merging processes, modifying cutting parameters, and improving technological equipment are common occurrences. However, in the past, because we were bound by dogmatism and empiricism, we often did not actively support the suggestions of the workers on modifying the technological regulations, but rather used the information in books to frighten the masses back. In fact, any kind of rule and regulation is created and summarized by the masses from production practice, and in turn guides the production activities of the masses, and then is revised, supplemented, and improved from practice. This is the law of production development. The worker comrades understand this very well. For example, two workers in Workshop 35 put forward two correct suggestions half a year ago, but the technical department believed that they did not comply with the provisions of the technical data and refused to adopt them. However, they secretly did the work for half a year, improving the efficiency by two to four times, until the Double-Anti Movement, when they finally received the support of the leadership. After the work of breaking down outdated rules was carried out, the worker masses made a total of 602 suggestions for modifying the technological regulations. After testing and identification, 90% were correct. After the implementation of these suggestions, the country can increase production and save 4.25 million yuan throughout the year.

　　In terms of material supply, there are also many rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces. For their own convenience, the supply department stipulated so-called twelve "no's" for receiving and issuing materials, such as "issue in the morning, not in the afternoon; issue before 5 o'clock, not after 5 o'clock; no issue on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays; no issue of materials for the next month before the 28th." For a long time, the supply department did not tell the production department the truth about the materials, and put forward the slogan of determining production by materials, that is, how much material they bought, the production unit would produce that much, instead of starting from the development of production and actively looking for material sources. This seriously restricted the development of production and aroused the dissatisfaction of the masses. Therefore, in the early days of the leap forward, many workers reflected: "Leap forward what? We leapt forward but have nothing to do."

　　Unreasonable rules and regulations not only bound the minds of the masses and hindered the development of productive forces, but also made most people sit in the office all day filling out forms and reports, reading forms and reports, and signing and stamping, making the grassroots production commanders fall into the quagmire of bureaucracy. We had a workshop material clerk who made more than 40 kinds of forms and documents. These forms and documents not only trapped himself in the office, but also required the workers to run around for his forms and reports, wasting time. The workshop director also had to approve and stamp each of his forms and reports. Such rules and regulations are indeed very harmful. Taking the material requisition form and the scattered repair form formulated by the accounting department as an example, more than 3.49 million stamps have to be affixed throughout the year, averaging nearly 10,000 times a day, resulting in three kinds of busyness: the worker masses are busy running errands to find someone to stamp, the management personnel are busy filling out forms and statistics, and the leaders are busy approving and stamping. These people are superstitious about the rules and regulations, and regard them as panaceas and inviolable things. They are full and idle all day long, only use forms and reports to understand the situation, and only lead production with rules and regulations, becoming bureaucrats who are divorced from production and divorced from reality. Instead of seriously summarizing and popularizing some advanced experiences and innovative initiatives created by the masses in production practice, promoting further development of production, they are full of officialdom and lifeless, resulting in hindering the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and the development of production, and the relationship with the masses is becoming more and more distant.

　　The origins of these outdated rules and regulations are roughly in four aspects:

　　First, subjective and one-sided, dogmatic, without asking about the specific situation of the factory, mechanically copying and transplanting the experience of other places.

　　Second, some of the rules and regulations issued by the higher authorities are not entirely reasonable, but in the process of implementation, we did not actively put forward suggestions for improvement, but mechanically implemented them.

　　Third, many management personnel lack a mass perspective and a perspective of serving production, are irresponsible, afraid of taking responsibility, use rules and regulations to tie up others, and ask others to sign and stamp everything, so that there is evidence to check and rules to prove when problems arise. Therefore, they formulate many rules and regulations and rely on rules and regulations to live their lives. They are not annoyed by the large number of systems and forms, but think that the more the better.

　　Fourth, some rules and regulations were originally necessary and reasonable, but because the situation has changed, they have become unnecessary and unreasonable. For example, the machine repair interval was originally stipulated to be once every six months. Due to the improvement of repair quality, the strengthening of maintenance work, and the improvement of workers' technical operations, the repair interval could have been extended, but the repair department still followed the old rules, which hindered production and wasted repair costs. The workers criticized: "This is calling good people into the hospital and throwing the people's property into the river."

　　The mass movement of anti-conservatism and breaking down outdated rules has fully exposed our leadership's three isms and five airs, reflecting that we still unconsciously inherit some of the bourgeoisie's methods of managing enterprises. Through this movement, we deeply feel that to reform technology and develop productive forces, we must boldly break down outdated rules and regulations with a revolutionary spirit. And to break down outdated rules, we must carry out repeated struggles with conservative ideas. Because the movement to break down outdated rules is itself an intense process of struggle against conservative ideas. Conservative ideas are the maintainers of outdated rules and regulations, and outdated rules and regulations are the legitimate basis for conservative ideas. Some leaders in our factory only believe in dead systems, not in living people, they only believe in ready-made technical data, and do not pay attention to the creativity of workers. But the facts have proved that once those outdated rules and regulations are broken down, the innovative initiatives of the masses will continue to emerge. But every initiative often has to break through several "checkpoints" and go through a fierce struggle to be realized. In particular, some senior technicians (bourgeois intellectuals), because their bourgeois standpoints and views have not been fundamentally transformed, look down on the creativity of workers, only believe in some knowledge learned from books, take a cold attitude towards technological innovation, and are indifferent to the revolutionary initiatives of the masses, even standing aside to watch the workers' "jokes." They also verbally expressed their approval of technological innovation, but as long as the masses' innovative initiatives had a little shortcoming, they would eloquently defend the old rules and regulations, and some even openly became obstructors and opponents of the realization of innovative initiatives. This struggle between the working class and the untransformed bourgeois intellectuals on technological innovation is a struggle between the working class ideology and the bourgeois ideology. The process of this struggle is also a process of thoroughly transforming these engineering and technical personnel. This struggle is still relatively long-term, and we must persist in this struggle, so that these engineering and technical personnel can be transformed in the practice of struggle, move towards the road of being both red and expert, so that they can combine with the worker masses and participate in the great technological revolution.

　　破除陈规陋矩解放生产力
　　重庆建设机床厂厂长  谭凯丰
    经过伟大的整风运动，我们工厂的干部和工人群众的政治思想觉悟都有了显著的提高，干部的作风转变了，工人的主人翁感觉强烈了，因而干群关系大大改善，工人之间的团结大大增强，全厂出现了一个又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅的生动活泼的政治局面。一个群众性的生产高潮就随着这种政治局面汹涌澎湃地开展起来。广大的工人群众迫切要求多快好省地建设社会主义，纷纷提出“一人顶两人，一天顶两天”的战斗口号，展开了比干劲、比先进的社会主义大竞赛。生产上新纪录不断出现，原定的生产计划和指标都一再被突破，一连修改、提高了五次。特别是在双反运动之后，群众比干劲、比先进的热潮，又加上比钻劲、比革新，一个群众性的技术革新运动就迅速形成起来。在技术革新运动中，群众迫切要求破除那些限制工人发挥积极性、创造性和妨碍生产力发展的规章制度。广大群众以排山倒海之势，采用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报的方法，针对陈规陋矩猛扫猛攻，双反运动就发展成为一个以破除陈规陋矩为中心的技术革新运动。到目前为止，全厂已将原有的七百四十九种规章制度，修改了二百四十九种，废除了一百九十六种，两项共占59％。将一千九百二十七种表报，合并、简化和废除了九百九十三种，占51.5％。陈规陋矩破除之后，群众皆大欢喜，拍手称快，思想更加活泼了，干劲和钻劲更大了，生产奇迹和创举大量出现，生产效率提高几倍、几十倍、几百倍、几千倍直到万倍。如青年铣工廖世刚采用了多刀、多卡、多机床管理的先进方法，并把铣床加工改为冲床加工，生产接连提高了一千六百八十倍，以十一天半的时间，完成了五年计划的工作量。老钳工曾德智将手工操作改为机械操作，生产一下就提高二万一千二百四十三倍。全厂出现了空前规模的大量技术革新者，提高生产效率50％以上的就有三千六百八十一人，占全厂工人的35％。群众性的技术革新运动，正一浪推一浪的高涨，使整个企业充满着蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。今年第一季度生产计划完成128％，比去年同期的生产实际增长44％，如果我们的管理工作能够跟上群众的跃进，及时组织新的平衡，生产成绩还会更大一些。
    我厂在反保守破陈规当中，揭发出来的问题是相当严重的。这种妨碍生产力发展的规章制度，比比皆是，表现在企业管理的各个方面。例如工艺权力过分集中，解决一个技术问题也得填表、盖章、申请，过八个关口。本来在机械加工厂，随着生产的发展，群众实践经验的创造和积累，合并工序，修改切削用量，改进工艺装置，是常有的事。但是，过去我们因为受到教条主义和经验主义的束缚，对工人群众提出修改工艺规程的建议，往往不是积极的支持，而是搬着书本上的资料把群众吓唬回去。其实，任何一种规章制度都是群众从生产实践中创造和总结出来的，反过来又指导群众的生产活动，再从实践中来修正、补充完善，这是生产发展的规律。工人同志们是非常懂得这一点的。如三十五车间有两个工人，半年前提了两件正确建议，技术部门认为不合技术资料规定，拒绝采纳，可是他们却偷偷地作了半年的活，提高功效两倍至四倍，直至双反运动中，才得到了领导上的支持。破陈规的工作开展之后，工人群众针对修改工艺规程的建议，共达六百零二件。经过试验鉴定，90％都是正确的。这些建议实现后，全年可为国家增产节约四百二十五万元。
    在材料供应上，妨碍生产力发展的规章制度也不少。供应部门图自己方便，对领发材料规定了“上午发，下午不发；五点钟前发，五点钟后不发；星期二、四、六不发；二十八号前对下月的材料不发”等所谓十二不发的制度。供应部门长期以来不对生产部门讲有关材料的真话，并且提出以料定产的口号，他们买进多少材料，生产单位就生产多少，而不从发展生产出发，积极寻找材料来源。这就严重地限制了生产的发展，引起了群众的不满。因此，在跃进初期，许多工人反映：“跃进啥？跃进了没活干。”
    不合理的规章制度，不仅束缚了群众的思想，妨碍了生产力的发展，而且也弄得大部分人整天坐在办公室填表报、看表报、签字盖章，使基层的生产指挥人员陷入了事务主义的泥坑。我们有个车间材料员，制订了四十几种表报单据，这些表报单据不仅套住自己走不出办公室，同时还要工人群众来为他的表报跑来跑去，浪费时间，车间主任也得为他的每个表报审批盖章。像这样的规章制度，的确为害非浅。仅以会计科制订的领料单、零星修理单两表为例，全年就要盖三百四十九万多次章，平均每天盖近一万次，造成的后果是三忙：工人群众找人盖章跑腿忙，管理人员填表统计忙，领导审批盖章忙。这些人迷信规章制度，把它看成是万应灵药、神圣不可侵犯的东西，他们饱食终日无所用心，只用表报了解情况，单凭规章制度领导生产，成了脱离生产、脱离实际的官僚主义者。对待群众在生产实践中创造出来的一些先进经验和革新创举，不是认真地总结和推广，促使生产进一步的发展，而是官气十足，暮气沉沉，结果妨碍了群众的积极性、创造性的发挥和生产的发展，同群众的关系也就越拉越远了。
    这些陈规陋矩的来由，大体上有四个方面：
    第一，主观片面，教条主义，不问本厂具体情况，一概原封不动地照抄照搬外地的经验。
    第二，上级颁发的规章制度，也有某些不尽合理，但是我们在执行过程中，没有积极地提出改进意见，却机械地加以贯彻。
    第三，许多管理人员缺乏群众观点和为生产服务的观点，不负责任，怕负责任，用规章制度拴住别人，事事叫别人签字盖章，以备出了问题有据可查，有章可证，因之，就制定许多规章制度，靠规章制度过日子。他们并不厌烦制度多，表报多，反而认为多多益善。
    第四，有些规章制度原来是必要的，合理的，但是因为情况发生了变化，变成不必要，不合理了。如机器检修间隔时间，原来规定半年一次，由于检修质量的提高、维护工作的加强和工人技术操作的改进，检修间隔时间本来可以延长，但检修部门仍然按照老规章办事，这就妨碍了生产，浪费了检修费用。工人批评说：“这是叫好人进医院，把人民财产往河里丢。”
    反保守、破陈规的群众运动，充分暴露了我们领导上的三个主义和五气，反映了我们还不自觉地因袭了一些资产阶级管理企业的方法。通过这次运动，使我们深深地感到：要革新技术，发展生产力，必须以革命精神大胆地破除陈规陋矩。而要破除陈规，就必须与保守思想进行反复的斗争。因为破除陈规的运动本身就是一个反保守思想的激烈斗争过程。保守思想是陈规陋矩的维护者，而陈规陋矩又是保守思想的合法依据。我厂有一些领导人员，他们只相信死制度，不相信活的人，他们只相信现成的技术资料，不重视工人的创造。可是事实证明了，一旦那些陈规陋矩被破除以后，群众的革新创举就会不断的涌现出来。但每一个创举，往往要突破几道“关口”，经过一番激烈的斗争才能实现。特别是一部分高级技术人员（资产阶级知识分子），由于资产阶级立场、观点没有根本改造过来，看不起工人的创造，只相信从书本上学来的一些知识，对革新技术抱冷淡态度，对群众满腔热忱的革命创举无动于衷，甚至站在一旁看工人的“笑话”。他们口头上也表示赞成技术革新，但只要群众的革新创举有了一点缺点，他们就振振有词地为旧的规章制度作辩护，有的人甚至公然成为实现革新倡议的阻挠者和反对派。这种工人阶级同未改造过来的资产阶级知识分子在技术革新上的斗争，是工人阶级思想与资产阶级思想的斗争。这种斗争的过程也就是一种彻底改造这些工程技术人员的过程。这一斗争还是比较长期的，我们必须坚持这一斗争，使这些工程技术人员在斗争的实践中得到改造，向着又红又专的道路前进，使他们能够和工人群众结合，参加到伟大的技术革命中来。
