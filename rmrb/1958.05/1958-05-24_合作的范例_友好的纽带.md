    A Model of Cooperation, Bonds of Friendship
    By our correspondent Li Ke
    Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic are working together to prepare for the construction of a canal linking the Danube and the Oder rivers. The closest points between the Danube and the Oder are only three hundred kilometers apart. If they are connected by a waterway, ships could travel directly from the Black Sea to the Baltic Sea. This would be the most convenient and economical transportation route connecting Northern and Southern Europe. Once the canal is built, Polish coal and industrial products from the German Democratic Republic can be exported using this waterway. Czechoslovakia can use this waterway to directly connect with the port of Szczecin on the Baltic Sea, gaining an excellent export port. The Soviet Union and many countries along the Danube, such as Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania, can also benefit from this canal.
    The Danube-Oder Canal is part of a close cooperation plan among socialist countries to jointly transform the Danube River, and is a waterway of international significance.
    Building the Danube-Oder Canal has been the dream of the countries involved for many centuries. As early as the 17th century, people planned to build this canal, but this massive project was impossible to realize in that era. Only when the people of these countries became masters of their nations did realizing this dream become a practical possibility. In 1948, Czechoslovakia and Poland jointly conducted preliminary designs for the canal. In 1957, when the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (Comecon) of eight socialist countries met in Moscow, countries interested in building the Danube-Oder Canal once again put the project on the agenda. Comecon entrusted Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the German Democratic Republic to prepare the economic and technical groundwork for building the canal. In January of this year, the three countries held meetings in Warsaw and Berlin, respectively, and agreed on a number of technical issues.
    As for where to build the Danube-Oder Canal, hydraulic engineering experts have proposed two plans: One route starts from the Danube River bank ten kilometers from Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, near the border with Hungary and Austria, and connects with the Oder River at Koźle in Poland. The total length is three hundred kilometers, of which fifty kilometers are in Poland. The advantage of this canal line is that it passes through the industrial areas of Czechoslovakia and Poland, and the terrain is flat and easy to excavate. The other plan is to use the Vah River, a tributary of the Danube River in Czechoslovakia, and divert water from the Vah River through a canal to connect with the Oder River. This canal line is shorter and can use the water level difference to build power stations. The difficulty is that it has to pass through mountainous areas, making the project more challenging. Currently, there are research and design institutes in Brno and Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, respectively studying these two plans, comparing their advantages and disadvantages to decide which one to adopt. Hydraulic engineering experts from Poland and Germany have also sent their designs and calculations to these two research institutes. As for the canal route within Poland, it is the responsibility of Polish hydraulic engineering experts to design. In September of this year, Comecon is scheduled to hold a meeting to discuss and decide on the construction of the canal and the sharing of expenses. At that time, this significant project can begin.
    According to preliminary designs, the Danube-Oder Canal, once built, can accommodate ships of 1,000 tons, and can transport 15 million tons of goods annually. The canal is expected to be completed around 1970.
    When I recently visited Comrade Góra-Hurski, Deputy Minister of the Polish Ministry of Water Resources, he said: "Building such a canal has sufficient economic value, and technical difficulties are not a major problem in our era. Of course, building the canal will cost a sum of money, probably 15 million zlotys per kilometer. The construction costs can be reasonably shared by the relevant countries in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. This modern international waterway will certainly be completed in a short period of time." He particularly emphasized that the construction of this canal will be another example of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among fraternal countries. This canal is a bond of friendship linking socialist countries, and it will connect the Eastern European socialist countries more closely. (Attached photo)

    合作的范例  友好的纽带
    本报记者　李克
    捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国正在同心合力准备开凿联接多瑙河—奥得河的运河。多瑙河和奥得河最近处相距不过三百公里，如果用水道把它们联接起来，轮船就可以从黑海直驶波罗的海。这是贯通欧洲南北最方便、最经济的运输线路。运河凿成后，波兰的煤、德意志民主共和国的工业品可以利用这条水路运送出口，捷克斯洛伐克利用这条水道，可以和波罗的海的兹杰辛港直接沟通起来，获得一个优良的出口港。苏联和多瑙河沿岸的许多国家，像匈牙利、保加利亚和罗马尼亚等国都可以从这条运河得到方便和好处。
    多瑙河—奥得河运河是社会主义国家亲密合作、共同改造多瑙河计划的一部分，是一条有国际意义的航道。
    开凿多瑙河—奥得河运河是有关国家许多世纪以来的理想。早在十七世纪，人们就计划开凿这条运河，但这个浩大的工程在那个时代是无法实现的。只有当这些国家的人民成了国家的主人，实现这个理想才有了现实意义。1948年捷克斯洛伐克和波兰就共同进行了开凿运河的初步设计，1957年社会主义国家八国经济互助委员会在莫斯科开会时，对开凿多瑙河—奥得河运河有兴趣的国家又重新把这项工程提上日程，经济互助委员会委托捷克斯洛伐克、波兰、德意志民主共和国作好开凿运河的经济和技术准备。今年1月，捷、波、德三国又分别在华沙和柏林举行了会议，商定了若干技术问题。
    多瑙河—奥得河运河开凿在什么地方，水利工程专家们提出了两个方案：一条线路是从捷克斯洛伐克和匈、奥交界地方距布拉迪斯拉发城十公里的多瑙河岸起，向北在波兰境内科兹勒地方和奥得河相接。全长三百公里，其中有五十公里在波兰境内。这条运河线的优点是，它经过捷波两国的工业区，地势平坦，易于开凿。另一个方案是利用捷境内多瑙河的支流发格河，从发格河上掘河引水和奥得河相通，这条运河线比较短，而且可以利用水位差修建发电站，困难的是要经过山区，工程艰巨。现在，在捷克斯洛伐克的布尔诺和布拉迪斯拉发城各有一个研究设计机关，分别对这两个方案进行研究，比较其优劣，以决定取舍。波兰、德国的水利专家们也把自己的设计和计算送到这两个研究机关里来。至于波兰境内的运河线路，则由波兰的水利工程专家负责设计。今年9月，社会主义国家经济互助委员会预定要举行会议，对运河的修建和经费的分担将协商决定。那时，这个有重大意义的工程就可动工了。
    根据初步设计，多瑙河—奥得河运河凿成后可以通行一千吨的轮船，每年可以运输一千五百万吨货物。运河预计在1970年前后凿成。
  当记者最近访问波兰水利部副部长戈拉胡尔斯基同志时，他说：“开凿这样一条运河有足够的经济价值，技术上的困难在我们的时代也不是大问题。自然，开凿运河要花一笔钱，大概开凿每一公里要花费一千五百万兹罗提。修建的费用各有关国家可以本着互助合作精神合理分担。这条现代化的国际水道一定可以在短期内建成”。他特别强调指出，这条运河的开凿将成为各兄弟国家进行经济互助合作的又一个范例。这条运河是联结社会主义国家的友好的纽带，它将把东欧各社会主义国家更紧密地联系起来。（附图片）
