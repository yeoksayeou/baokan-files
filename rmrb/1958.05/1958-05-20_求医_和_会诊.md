　　"Seeking Medical Advice" and "Consultation"
　　Peng Cheng
    During the rectification movement in universities and colleges, people created many new forms of ideological remolding while opening their hearts and making red and expert plans. One of them is called "Seeking Medical Advice Conference," which is initiated by those suffering from ideological problems who actively seek out people who understand them relatively well. They hold a small meeting, inviting those who are invited to conduct consultations based on the condition, carefully analyze and study the nature of the ideological problem and its root causes, and finally prescribe the right medicine. Through this form, the condition often improves, the patient feels relaxed and happy, and the doctors are all pleased.
    I believe this new type of "seeking medical advice" and "consultation" illustrates at least three issues:
    First, people's awareness and initiative in demanding ideological remolding has soared. People deeply realize that it is impossible to carry out ideological remolding by secretly discarding burdens or reflecting and repenting behind closed doors. Therefore, they actively spread out their thoughts and actively seek the help of Party organizations and comrades, in order to analyze and criticize thoroughly and solve problems completely. The "Seeking Medical Advice Conference" emerged in response to this.
    Second, the class friendship and mutual cooperation between comrades has been further strengthened. In the old society, "taking care of oneself" and "each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" became the way for old intellectuals to conduct themselves in the world. Today, however, they are going against this, and caring for the collective and caring for comrades has gradually become a social trend. For the sake of common ideals and cause, people regard the shortcomings of comrades as their own shortcomings, and must find ways to help overcome them. The "consultation" form fully illustrates this issue.
    Third, the mass line working method is implemented in ideological remolding work. A Bian Que or Hua Tuo can cure the chronic diseases of a patient's body, but people's ideological "diseases" are much more complex than physical diseases, and often beyond the power of a single Bian Que or Hua Tuo. The benefit of "consultation" lies in its ability to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, exert collective strength, correctly diagnose the condition and explore the source of the disease, so as to prescribe the right medicine.
    "Seeking Medical Advice" and "Consultation" is a new form that accelerates people's ideological remolding. I hope it can be promoted as one of the valuable experiences in the "double anti" movement.

　　“求医”和“会诊”
　　彭澄
    在高等学校的整风运动中，人们在交心和订红专规划的时候，创造了许多改造思想的新形式。其中之一叫“求医会”，就是由思想病患者主动地找些比较了解自己的人，开一个小型会议，请被邀请的人根据病情，进行会诊，仔细分析研究思想病的性质及其产生的根源，最后对症下药。通过这一形式，往往能使病情好转，患者既轻松愉快，医生也皆大欢喜。
    这新型的“求医”和“会诊”，我认为它至少说明了三个问题：
    第一，人们要求改造思想的自觉性和主动性高涨了。人们深刻地认识到：采取背地丢包袱、关门反省悔过的办法来进行思想改造是行不通的，因而主动地把思想摊开来，积极争取党组织和同志们的帮助，以求分析批判深透，解决问题彻底。“求医会”就是这样应运而生的。
    第二，同志之间的阶级友谊和互助合作进一步加强了。在旧社会里，“独善其身”、“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”，成为旧知识分子立身处世之道。今天却一反其道而行之，关心集体、关心同志已经逐渐成为社会风气。为了共同的理想和事业，人们把同志的缺点看作自己的缺点，一定要想方设法帮助克服。“会诊”这一形式就充分地说明了这个问题。
    第三，在改造思想工作上，贯彻了群众路线的工作方法。一个扁鹊或华陀，可以治好病人身体上的沉疴痼疾，但人们思想上的“疾病”要比身体上的疾病复杂得多，往往是一个扁鹊或华陀所不能为力的。“会诊”的好处，就在于能集中群众智慧，发挥集体力量，正确地诊断病情和探寻病源，做到对症下药。
    “求医”和“会诊”这是一个加速人们的思想改造的新形式，我愿它能作为“双反”运动中的宝贵经验之一加以推广。
