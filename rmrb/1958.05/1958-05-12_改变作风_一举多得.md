　　Changing Work Style, Achieving Multiple Gains
　　By Shen Luming, First Secretary of the CPC Qinxian County Committee
    Before 1956, our county committee comrades didn't delve deeply enough into the grassroots; most of the time we sat in the office. Since 1957, especially since the rectification movement, the leadership style of the county committee has changed significantly. The county committee office now keeps only one secretary and a caretaker office; the remaining four secretaries and more than ten committee members are working in the field most of the time, moving wherever there's a problem and staying there to solve it. Last winter, the water conservancy project in Qinxian County was under pressure, but because of the freezing weather, many migrant workers were thinking of calling it quits, and the project was progressing very slowly. At this difficult moment, our county leaders took more than 300 county-level cadres to the countryside. At many water conservancy sites, temporary offices of the county committee and the county people's committee appeared, not just for office work but also to take the lead in water conservancy construction. As soon as we arrived at the construction site, we took the lead in working, working from dark to dawn. In the severe cold of more than ten degrees below zero, our five secretaries took off their clothes and went into the water one by one, insisting on building dams and digging soil. Under these circumstances, the migrant workers who originally had thoughts of quitting were deeply moved and made public vows: "Fight hard in the icy and snowy ground, break through the cold barrier, work from dawn till dusk, and subdue nature." This enabled the county's water conservancy projects to continue construction throughout the winter.

    Of course, to truly strengthen leadership, it is not enough to solve problems only after they have occurred; it is also necessary to implement proactive and in-depth leadership. On this point, the Qinxian County Committee has adopted a leadership method of professional division of labor, going deep into one area, participating in production, studying technology, creating experience, and promoting overall progress. All county committee members are specifically assigned to be responsible for a profession, and whichever profession they are responsible for, they cultivate an experimental plot, which not only enables the county committee comrades themselves to achieve the goal of being both "red and expert" but also creates experience to proactively solve problems for the grassroots. For example, secretaries Wu Yuyu and Zhang Junde, a member of the county standing committee, didn't understand water conservancy at first, but after being assigned to water conservancy and establishing experimental plots, they quickly became familiar with various organizational leadership aspects of reservoir construction and the political and ideological work at the construction site. They explored systematic leadership experience in building reservoirs and also learned a lot of water conservancy knowledge, determining more than ten reservoirs and their branch canals for the county. The masses called them "Minister of Water Conservancy," "Secretary of Water Conservancy," "Water Conservancy Experts," and "Living Dragon Kings." Another secretary, Wei Zhaotang, didn't know how to raise pigs at first, but after taking the lead in animal husbandry, he actively studied technology and cultivated experimental plots. Now he has learned to diagnose fourteen kinds of pig diseases and can give pigs vaccinations. Wherever he goes, he helps the masses prevent and control swine fever, greatly reducing the mortality rate of pigs in the county. The masses enthusiastically call him a "volunteer veterinarian."

    After the county committee comrades went deep into the grassroots, participated in production, and led production, they further enriched the content of the county committee's collective leadership. In the past, because the leading comrades of the county committee did not understand the actual situation at the grassroots level, they could not produce concrete materials when holding county committee meetings and formulating plans. The meetings were rambling, failing to hit the nail on the head, and unable to formulate practical plans. For example, Qinxian County's annual water conservancy plan was made every year, but because it did not proceed from reality, it was either overly ambitious or conservative. Now it is different. The secretary in charge of water conservancy personally surveys the site, talks with engineers, and learns about the situation of migrant workers, material supply, and project progress from personally participating in production. Thus, when the county committee formulated the 1958 water conservancy plan, he put forward practical and concrete opinions, making it easier for other committee members to put forward opinions, and thus a practical water conservancy plan was formulated. The same situation exists in the formulation of agriculture, animal husbandry, forestry, and other plans.

    Enriching the content of the county committee's collective leadership is also reflected in strengthening leadership over business and technical departments. In the past, because the leading cadres of the Qinxian County Committee did not understand technology, their leadership over these departments was always a relatively weak link. Now it is different. The leading cadres of the county committee have learned the technology themselves, so they can implement both political and ideological leadership and business and technical leadership over these departments.

    Finally, after the county committee goes deep into the grassroots, it also strengthens the relationship between leaders and the masses. Many secretaries and committee members have made close friends with the masses and formed an inseparable bond with them. Some secretaries and committee members, after returning to the city from the countryside for a few days of meetings, are constantly visited by old farmers. Some people come directly to our homes to talk about the situation and raise questions. An old farmer named Wang Guiying once came directly to my home to report the problem of unclear accounts in his cooperative. This allows us to further understand the voices and demands of the masses, so that our leadership work can proceed more from the masses' immediate interests.

　　改变作风　一举多得
　　中共沁县县委第一书记　申鲁明
    1956年以前，我们县委会同志深入基层非常不够，大部分时间坐在办公室里。1957年，特别是整风运动以来，县委领导作风有了很大改变。县委机关除留一个书记和一个留守处以外，其余四个书记和十多个委员大部分时间是在下面流动办公，哪儿有问题，就住下来解决。去年冬天，沁县水利工程任务紧张，但是，因为天寒地冻，许多民工有收兵思想，工程进展很慢。就在这个困难的时刻，我们县的领导干部带了三百多名县级机关干部下乡了。在许多水利工地上，出现了县委和县人民委员会临时办公室的牌子，不仅办公，首先是带头修水利。一到工地我们就带头干起来，从黑夜干到天明，在零下十多度的严寒天气，我们五个书记一个个脱衣下水，坚持打坝、挖土。在这样情况下，原来有收兵思想的民工深受感动，纷纷集中宣誓：“苦战冰雪地，打破寒冷关，披星戴月干，驯服大自然”。因而使全县水利工程坚持了冬季施工。
    当然，要能真正加强领导，往往在发生了问题以后，才去解决问题，那是不够的，还要实行主动的、深入的领导。在这一点上，沁县县委采取了专业分工、深入一点、参加生产、钻研技术、创造经验、推动全面的领导方法。所有县委成员具体分工负责一个专业，负责什么专业，就搞什么试验田，这样既可使县委同志本身达到又红又专的目的，又可创造经验主动给基层解决问题。比如，书记吴宇玉、县常委张俊德原来不懂水利，自分工搞水利并建立了试验田以后，很快熟悉了水库施工的各种组织领导工作及工地政治思想工作，摸索出了系统的修建水库的领导经验，还学会了许多水利知识，为全县确定了十余个水库和水库的支干渠，群众叫他俩“水利部长”、“水利书记”、“水利专家”、“活龙王”。另一书记卫兆堂，原来并不懂得养猪，自挂了畜牧专业的帅以后，积极钻技术，搞试验田，现在已经学会了看十四种猪病，并会给猪打防疫针，他走到哪里，就帮助哪里群众防治猪瘟，使全县猪的死亡率大大降低。群众热情的叫他“义务兽医”。
    县委会同志亲自深入基层，参加生产、领导生产以后，进一步丰富了县委会集体领导的内容。过去，县委会领导同志由于不了解基层实际情况，开县委会，制定计划的时候，总是拿不出具体材料，会议东拉西扯，击不中要害，订不出切实可行的计划。比如沁县的年度水利计划，过去年年订，但是，由于不是从实际出发，不是冒了，就是保守。现在不同了，负责水利的书记亲自在现场勘察，和工程师谈话，又从亲自参加生产当中，了解到民工、材料供应、工程进度等等情况，这样，县委会在制定1958年水利规划的时候，他就提出了又切实又具体的意见，这样别的委员也就容易提出意见，因而也就订出了切实可行的水利规划。在制订农业、畜牧、林业等规划时也都有同样情况。
    丰富县委集体领导的内容，还表现在加强了对业务、技术部门的领导。过去由于沁县县委会的领导干部不懂技术，对这些部门的领导，始终是比较薄弱的一环。现在不同了，县委会领导干部自己学会了技术，对这些部门既能实行政治思想领导，又能实行业务技术领导。
    最后，县委会深入基层以后，还密切了领导干部和群众之间的关系，许多书记和委员和群众交了知心朋友，和群众结成了血肉不可分的亲密联系，有些书记、委员从乡下回到城里开几天会，总有老农不断的找来，有些人直接找到我们家里，谈情况，提问题。有一个叫王贵英的老农，就曾直接找到我家里，向我反映他那个合作社账目不清的问题。这样，就使我们更加深入了解到群众的呼声和要求，使我们的领导工作更能从群众切身利益出发。
