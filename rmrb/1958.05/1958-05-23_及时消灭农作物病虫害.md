    According to predictions from various locations, the characteristics of this year's diseases and pests are: early occurrence, large quantities, and rapid onset. Currently, cotton aphids and rice stem borers have already begun to cause damage. Locusts have successively hatched and emerged from the soil. The first generation of armyworm moths is several times higher than in the past. Wheat stem rust, stripe rust, and scab have spread in some areas. Various fruit tree diseases and pests are also occurring. This situation indicates that this year's diseases and pests may be very serious, and we must be highly vigilant.
    In order to cooperate with this year's Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and ensure that crops are not attacked by diseases and pests, unprecedented preparations have been made nationwide from last winter to this spring: plans have been formulated, technical forces have been trained, and a series of on-site promotion meetings have been held. According to statistics from seventeen provinces, it is planned to control various diseases and pests on more than 1.38 billion mu, more than double that of last year. According to statistics from another twenty-one provinces and cities, it is planned to thoroughly control 350 million mu on a large scale, an increase of sixty times compared to last year. Various localities are also preparing to create 690 counties and cities free from major diseases and pests or free from single diseases and pests this year. Great efforts have also been made in the preparation of pesticides and machinery: a total of 480,000 tons of various pesticides have been raised (last year's actual sales volume was only 150,000 tons), and 3.1 million sprayers and dusters (last year's actual sales volume was only 700,000). Various localities have also summarized past experiences in fighting diseases and pests and put forward several new combat methods: individual combat by various regions, implementing joint encirclement combat by several regions; changing from fighting a single disease or pest to comprehensive prevention and control of several diseases and pests of a certain crop. Reconnaissance is carried out before the battle in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop at the right time. These are all very favorable conditions for fighting diseases and pests this year. It can be asserted that as long as we rely on the masses, fully utilize all favorable conditions and positive factors, we are fully confident of overcoming diseases and pests. The work of eliminating overwintering pests and preventing and controlling wheat sucking midges and stem rust last winter and this spring was faster and better than in any previous year, which is a powerful illustration.
    However, we must not think that everything is fine in this regard and that we can sit back and relax. From the perspective of the prevention and control season, now is only the beginning of a comprehensive and decisive battle. Arduous work lies ahead.
    In order to achieve a complete victory in this year's battle against diseases and pests, all localities must deeply mobilize the masses and arouse the enthusiasm of the broad masses. According to past experiences in various localities, wherever the masses are mobilized well, there are more methods for preventing and controlling diseases and pests, and there are more innovations in solving the problems of pesticides and machinery. The agricultural tool exhibitions held in various localities show that the masses have many creations in the equipment for controlling insects, especially in the modification of sprayers. Therefore, the prevention and control of diseases and pests must follow the mass line, like the movement to build water conservancy projects, and rely on the wisdom and creativity of the masses. By mobilizing the wisdom of the masses, modifying one sprayer can be equivalent to several. The existing advanced experiences in various localities should be rapidly promoted and applied.
    The main problem in the current prevention and control work is to have practical prevention and control measures to ensure the elimination of diseases and pests in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. This year, the state has supplied more pesticides and machinery, but it still cannot fully meet the needs. Therefore, in this year's struggle against diseases and pests, we must still use various weapons. In addition to highly effective agents such as "666", "DDT", "1605", and "1059", we must also use a variety of local pesticides and local formulas such as tobacco, derris, yam bean, bitter tree bark, oil preparations, arsenic preparations, and fluorine preparations. In addition to sprayers, dusters, and airplanes, we must also use other insecticidal tools. All localities must use all means to fully exert the effectiveness of existing pesticides and machinery, and at the same time pay attention to saving pesticides and machinery, cherishing pesticides and machinery, and using pesticides and machinery at critical moments. That is to say, we must pay attention to strategy. We must not only win battles, but also fight cleverly. In the past, some places caused great waste due to untimely and improper application of medicines. This year, we should emphasize prediction and forecasting. In addition to professional monitoring stations and points, we must also teach the masses simple insect condition inspection techniques, so that agricultural cooperatives have people to check insect conditions, and persist in prevention and control under the guidance of "insect conditions." And we must treat them carefully, without losing any plants or missing any trees. Only in this way can we improve the prevention and control effect, reduce the number of prevention and control times, prevent aimless shots, and achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results.
    We must advocate simultaneous treatment, that is, treating several pests with one application of medicine, instead of one prescription for one pest. Simultaneous treatment is a method that saves both medicine and labor, and the masses call it "one key opens several locks." Some areas have created very good experiences in this regard, and all localities should pay attention to promotion.
    Every year, there is a pattern in the occurrence of diseases and pests, that is, some places are light and some places are heavy. Therefore, provinces and special districts must grasp a part of the pesticides and machinery for mobile deployment. And they should have the right to transfer part of the pesticides and machinery from areas with more pesticide and machinery preparations and lighter disease and pest occurrences to support other areas. Provinces should also support each other when necessary. All localities should proceed from the overall situation and obey unified deployment.
    This year's scale of disease and pest prevention and control is unprecedented, and the requirements are much higher than in the past. Therefore, sufficient preparations must be made before the start of each prevention and control stage. Supervision and inspection should be strengthened during the prevention and control period. After the prevention and control is completed, a serious summary should be carried out. Achieve timely prevention and control, economical use of medicines, tight organization, and timely exchange of experience. Not only should the scope of prevention and control be large, but also the prevention and control should be thorough.
    Diseases and pests are now occurring and spreading. All localities must fully estimate the importance and timeliness of this work, immediately take action, promptly eliminate diseases and pests, and ensure the increase in crop production.

### 及时消灭农作物病虫害

    及时消灭农作物病虫害
    根据各地预测预报，今年病虫害的特点是：发生早、数量大、来势猛。目前，棉花蚜虫、水稻螟虫已经开始为害。蝗虫相继孵化出土。粘虫第一代的发蛾量比以往高出数倍。小麦秆锈病、条锈病、赤霉病已在部分地区蔓延。多种果树病虫害也在发生。这种情况，说明今年病虫害可能很严重，必须引起高度的警惕。
    为了配合今年农业生产大跃进，保证农作物不受病虫害侵袭，从去冬到今春全国进行了规模空前的准备工作：制定了规划，培训了技术力量，召开了一系列的战地促进会议。据十七个省统计，计划防治各种病虫害十三亿八千多万亩，比去年扩大一倍以上。另据二十一个省、市统计，计划大面积彻底防治三亿五千余万亩，比去年增长六十倍。各地并且准备在今年创造出六百九十个无主要病虫或是无单项病虫为害的县市。在药械准备上也作了巨大的努力：共筹办各种农药四十八万吨（去年实销量仅十五万吨），喷雾器、喷粉器三百一十万架（去年实销量仅七十万架）。各地还总结以往与病虫害作战的经验，提出几种新的作战方法：由各个地区单独作战，实行几个地区的联合包围作战；由单独对一种病虫害作战，改为综合防治某种农作物的几种病虫害。在作战之前作好情况侦察，以便在恰当时机一举歼灭。这些都是今年同病虫害进行斗争的十分有利的条件。可以断言，只要依靠群众，充分利用一切有利条件和积极因素，战胜病虫害是完全有把握的。去冬今春消灭过冬害虫、防治小麦吸浆虫和秆锈病的工作比以往任何一年都做得又快又好，就是一个有力的说明。
    但是决不能认为，我们在这方面已经万事大吉，可以高枕无忧了。从防治季节来说，现在仅仅是全面的、带有决定性的战斗的开始。艰巨的工作还在后面。
    为了在今年防治病虫害的战斗中取得完满的胜利，各地必须深入发动群众，把广大群众的积极性调动起来。根据过去各地的经验，凡是群众发动较好的地方，防治病虫害的办法也就比较多，药械问题的解决上也有更多的创造。各地举办的农具展览会表明，群众在治虫的器械方面有很多的创造，特别在喷雾器的改装上。所以，防治病虫害必须同兴修水利等运动一样，走群众路线，依靠群众的智慧和创造力。把群众的智慧发动起来，改装一架喷雾器就可以当好几架用。各地已有的先进经验，应当迅速地推广应用起来。
    当前防治工作中的主要问题，是要有切实的防治措施，保证多快好省地消灭病虫害。今年国家供应药械较多，但仍不能完全满足需要，因此今年与病虫害作斗争中仍然必须使用各种武器。除了“666”、“滴滴涕”、“1605”、“1059”等效力高的药剂以外，还必须使用烟草、毛鱼藤、豆薯、苦树皮、油类制剂、砒素剂、氟素剂等多种多样的土药土方。除了喷雾器、喷粉器、飞机以外，还得使用其他的灭虫工具。各地必须用一切办法充分发挥现有药械的效能，同时要注意节省药械、爱护药械、把药械用在节骨眼上。也就是说要讲究策略。不仅要打胜仗，还要打巧仗。以往有些地方由于施药不得其时和不得其法而造成的浪费很大。今年应当强调预测预报，除了专业的测报站和点以外，还必须把简单的虫情检查技术教给群众，让农业社社社有人检查虫情，坚持在“虫情”指导下进行防治。并且要治得精细，不丢株漏棵。这样才能提高防治效果，减少防治遍数，防止无的放矢，做到多快好省。
    要提倡兼治，即打一次药兼治几种害虫，而不是一个害虫一个单方。兼治是既省药剂又省人工的办法，群众把这叫做“一把钥匙开几把锁”。这方面有的地区创造了很好的经验，各地应注意推广。
    每年病虫害的发生有一条规律，就是有的地方轻，有的地方重。因此，省、专都必须掌握一部分药械作为机动调剂之用。并且应当有权从药械准备较多、病虫发生较轻的地区抽调一部分药械支援其他地区。各省之间，有必要时也须相互支援。各地都应当从整体出发，服从统一调配。
    今年防治病虫害的规模是空前的，要求也比以往高得多。所以在每一个防治阶段开始以前，都必须作充分的准备。防治期间要加强督促检查。防治结束以后要认真进行总结。做到防治适时，用药节省，组织严密，经验交流及时。不仅防治的面要大，还要防治得彻底。
    现在病虫害正在发生、蔓延。各地必须充分估计这一工作的重要性和时间性，立即行动起来，及时消灭病虫害，保证农作物的增产。
