　　Get Rid of Daintiness
　　Ye Wen

    Some people have noticed that among the "five airs," daintiness is more prevalent among female comrades. To be more precise, it should probably be said that daintiness is more prevalent among intellectuals, with women perhaps being more numerous within that group. The main manifestations are: inability to endure hardship, intolerance of criticism, excessive sensitivity, and an overly strong sense of self-esteem; if they suffer some grievances or hardships, tears will flow; sometimes, they will even act spoiled for no apparent reason...

    I have not conducted a survey or statistics, but thinking carefully, it is not surprising, nor is it a coincidence, that female daintiness is more common than male daintiness. In the old exploitative society, the exploiting classes, after indulging in wine and food, amused themselves by toying with women, and gradually stipulated standards of "beauty" for playthings, which were to be "delicate and frail," with "three-inch golden lotuses, slender jade hands," "a maid supporting her, languid and weak," "a willow waist slender enough to fit in the palm of one's hand," and also "never smiling to reveal teeth," and "crying like a tearful person" at the slightest provocation... Enough, in short, it had to be "infinitely shy" to serve as a plaything. What people find disgusting and laughable now was once appreciated and praised by the ruling class and their sycophantic literati. Thus, women, who were in a subordinate position in society and in the family, competed to imitate this trend, making themselves weak and fragile. And they did not realize that this was destroying themselves.

    These kinds of daintiness can only be formed and established in a society of class exploitation. Without this exploitation as a foundation, literati could not be refined, talented scholars could not be romantic, and daintiness could not take root. For example, the laboring people of that time, if they wanted to work, they certainly could not be dainty. If they wanted to be dainty, they would not have enough to eat and would have to hang themselves. They may have blindly believed that this kind of daintiness was beautiful, but apart from being astonished and exclaiming "heavenly," they would never have defined it as the standard of beauty for their own class.

    It can be seen that the character "娇" (jiao, dainty) has the radical "女" (nǚ, female), and since ancient times, women have been more often dainty. This has an economic basis and social roots, and the fault lies not in the women themselves, but in the evil old society.

    Now we are in an era where the laboring people are the masters of the country. The social thoughts and feelings are different, and the aesthetic views have also changed accordingly. Our standards of beauty are produced in labor, so the positive image of women in our era should be: like male comrades, strong and brave in spirit, able to withstand not only criticism, but even a force 12 typhoon and giant waves, standing firm, unafraid of any difficulties, and always advancing by leaps and bounds; in terms of physical health, strong and sturdy, able to endure hardship and hard work, going to the countryside and up the mountains, farming and working, capable of everything. This is entirely possible, firstly because we have the support of the Party and the laboring people, and secondly because women have broken free from all constraints, are truly independent, and men and women are equal.

    However, one cannot build without destroying. While establishing new customs and forming a new style, we must thoroughly eliminate the poison of the old society. Among many of us, there may not be much daintiness in action, but there is still a lot of daintiness in thought and feeling. Although he (or she) verbally admits that this kind of daintiness is undesirable, deep down, they still cling to the remains and refuse to let go. For example, in the conditions for choosing a spouse, a dainty viewpoint is more common and clearly exposed. How can this be regarded as a minor detail of life and treated lightly?

    In the past, it was "rats crossing the street, everyone shouting 'kill them!'" Now, without waiting for the rats to cross the street, we dig their holes, break their nests, and want to exterminate them all. Eliminating daintiness seems to require the same vigor as eliminating the four pests. Therefore, in addition to regular labor exercise, ideological remolding on weekdays cannot be relaxed. The fact is that one person's daintiness makes everyone uncomfortable: others are uncomfortable before it is pointed out; the person themselves is uncomfortable once it is pointed out. Obviously, one person's discomfort is a small matter, and besides, this is like a skin disease patient, a process of shedding old scabs and growing new flesh after treatment, which is a good thing. May we intellectuals, especially female intellectuals, including the author herself, come to mercilessly and thoroughly get rid of this kind of daintiness and become strong warriors needed to build socialism!

### 打掉娇气

　　打掉娇气
　　叶雯
    有人发现，五气之中，娇气以女同志居多。要是更确切些，恐怕应该说成：娇气以知识分子居多，其中女的又可能多些。主要表现是：吃不得苦，受不起批评，脸皮过薄，自尊心过强；倘若受了些委屈或吃了些苦，便会泪落两行；有时还会莫名其妙地撒些娇……。
    我并没有作过调查统计，但仔细想想，女娇多于男娇，并不奇怪，也绝非偶然。旧社会的剥削阶级，酒醉饭饱之余，拿妇女玩乐寻开心，于是渐渐规定出作为玩物的“美”的标准来，是要“弱不禁风”的，“金莲三寸、玉手纤纤”的，“侍儿扶起娇无力”的，“柳腰纤细掌中轻”的，还要“笑不露齿”，动不动就“哭得泪人儿似的”……。够了，总之是要“无限娇羞”，才能起到玩物的作用。现在人觉得恶心喷饭，从前却被统治阶级及其帮闲文人们欣赏赞扬。于是，无论在社会上或是家庭中都处于附庸地位的妇女，在这种流风习气里，也就竞相效颦，弄得个个软弱脆薄。而她们并不自觉这是在摧残自身。
    这种种娇气，只有在阶级剥削的社会里才能形成和立足下来。若没有这剥削作基础，文人就雅不起来，才子也风流不下去，娇气就无从生根。例如那时的劳动人民，如果要劳动，就一定不能娇气。若要娇，肚皮不饱，只好上吊了。他们也许也盲从地认为这种种娇气是美，但大约除了惊愕、赞一声“天仙般的”以外，是决计不会定为本阶级的美的标准的。
    可见，娇字从女旁，自古女子多娇，是有经济基础和社会根源的，罪不在妇女本身，而在万恶的旧社会。
    现在我们是劳动人民当家作主的时代了。社会的思想感情不同，审美观也就随之转变。我们的美的标准产生在劳动之中，因此我们时代的妇女的正面形象，应当是：和男同志一样，在精神方面坚强勇敢，别说批评受得起，即使是十二级大风巨浪，也顶得住，站得稳，不怕任何困难，总要大步跃进；在身体方面，健康结实，吃苦耐劳，下乡上山，种田干活，无所不能。这是完全办得到的，一则有党和劳动人民的支持，二则妇女已经摆脱了一切束缚，真正独立了，男女平等了。
    然而不破不立，在树立新风气、形成新风格的同时，必须彻底消灭旧社会的遗毒。在我们许多人中间，行动上的娇气可能不多，但思想感情上的娇气依然不少。尽管他（她）口头上承认这种种娇气要不得，然而思想深处却还迷恋骸骨，紧抱不放。例如在选择爱人的条件上，就比较普遍和明显地暴露出娇气的观点来。这岂可以当作生活小节，而等闲视之？
    从前是“老鼠过街，人人喊打”，现在是不待老鼠过街，就去挖它的穴，破它的窠，要灭尽杀绝。消灭娇气，似乎也该拿出这除四害的劲头来。因此除了定期劳动锻炼外，平日的思想改造不可放松。现在事实上是一人有娇，众人难受：未经指出，别人难受；一经指出，本人难受。显然一人难受事小，况且，这仿佛是皮肤病患者，一经医治后，剥落旧痂生长新肉的过程，是好事。愿我们这些知识分子，尤其是女知识分子，包括作者本人在内，都来毫不容情地彻底打掉这种种娇气，成为建设社会主义所需要的坚强战士！
