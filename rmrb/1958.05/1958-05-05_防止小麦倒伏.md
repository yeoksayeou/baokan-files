Current agricultural production should pay attention to:

    Preventing Wheat Lodging
    Recently, some wheat fields in Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Shandong and other provinces have been growing excessively, and if post-management is not good, there is a risk of lodging. This should arouse widespread attention in wheat-producing areas.
    Wheat lodging generally has three types: one is due to the soil being too moist and soft, losing its plasticity and ability to support the stems, causing lodging at the base of the wheat; the second is due to the weight of the above-ground parts of the plant and the strength of the stem not being matched, leading to the stem bending and lodging; and the third is lodging due to stem breakage. What we usually see mostly belongs to the first or second type.
    Generally speaking, lodged wheat is growing relatively well. Because it grows luxuriantly, the plants are dense, the stems are tall, and the ears are heavy, it will cause lodging. If it grows weakly, the plants are sparse, the stems are short, and the ears are small, it generally will not lodge. The possible lodging of some wheat fields this year precisely shows that this year's wheat is growing particularly well and a bumper harvest is expected.
    Some places, because they are afraid of excessive wheat growth and lodging, have stopped topdressing fertilizer on second- and third-class wheat fields, which is wrong. Second- and third-class wheat fields should continue to strengthen management and strive to catch up with first-class seedlings as soon as possible. Some dry places are afraid of lodging and dare not water, which is also wrong. Appropriately watering according to the needs of wheat growth is only beneficial to wheat and has no harm. Some places have proposed plowing every other row of wheat seedlings, which is even more wrong. Because generally excessively grown wheat may not lodge if it does not encounter strong winds and heavy rain; if it lodges during the jointing and heading stage, the wheat will still stand up later; if it lodges in the late stage of maturity, the grains are already full, and the impact on yield may not be significant. The method of plowing every other row will definitely greatly reduce the yield.
    Judging from the experience of some regions, wheat lodging can be prevented. The measures to prevent lodging are as follows:
    First, stop topdressing nitrogen fertilizer and increase the application of some phosphorus and potassium fertilizers. Some wheat fields are growing excessively, mainly because the fertilizer applied contains more nitrogen. Do not topdress nitrogen fertilizer on such wheat fields. Phosphorus and potassium fertilizers have a certain effect on enriching wheat stems and grains. Increasing the application of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers can prevent lodging and also help increase unit yield. Wood ash is a very good potash fertilizer, and a certain amount of wood ash can be topdressed before wheat heading.
    Second, control the moisture in the wheat fields. Excessive moisture in the wheat fields is also a factor that promotes excessive wheat growth and lodging. Therefore, areas with more rain should pay attention to clearing ditches and drainage; areas that are not dry can water less or even not water. When watering, one should also choose windless weather.
    Third, cut off some wheat leaves. Some areas have adopted this method for excessively overgrown and dense wheat and have played a certain inhibitory role. Some agricultural scientific institutions, through small-scale experiments, also believe that this is a way to inhibit excessive growth.
    Lodged wheat after heading and grain filling should generally not be moved randomly, so as to avoid damage caused by random movement. In southern areas, in the case of rainy and humid conditions, for mature lodged wheat, it can be harvested in advance, otherwise the wheat grains pressed underneath will swell and germinate.

### 防止小麦倒伏

专栏：当前农业生产上应注意的事情

    防止小麦倒伏
    最近江苏、湖北、河南、山东等省都有少数麦田生长过旺，如果后期管理不好就有倒伏危险。这应该引起麦产区的普遍重视。
    小麦倒伏一般有三种类型：一种是由于土壤过分湿润松软，失去塑性和支持茎秆的能力，在小麦根部倒伏；另一种是由于植株地上部分的重量和茎秆强度不相适应，以致茎秆弯曲倒伏；再一种是由于茎秆折伤而倒伏。我们平时常见的大多属于第一种或第二种。
    一般说来倒伏的小麦都是生长比较好的。因为生长茂盛，植株稠密，茎秆高，穗子重才会引起倒伏。如果生长瘦弱，植株稀疏，茎秆矮，穗子小，一般是不会倒伏的。今年一些麦田可能出现倒伏，正说明今年的小麦生长特别好，丰收有望。
    有些地方因为害怕小麦徒长倒伏，而对二、三类麦田停止加工施肥，这是不对的。二、三类麦田应该继续加强管理，争取早日赶上一类苗。有些干旱的地方怕倒伏，不敢浇水，这也是不对的。根据小麦生长需要而适当浇水，对小麦只有好处没有坏处。有的地方提出隔一行犁一行麦苗，这更是不对的。因为一般徒长的小麦如果不遇到大风大雨不一定倒伏；如果在拔节抽穗期间倒伏，以后小麦还会站起来；在成熟后期倒伏，籽实已经饱满，对产量的影响不一定很大。而用隔一行犁一行的办法，肯定会大大减低产量。
    从一些地区的经验看，小麦的倒伏是可以防止的。防止倒伏的措施有这样一些：
    一、停止追施氮肥和增施一些磷、钾肥料。有些麦田生长过旺，主要是由于施用的肥料中含氮较多，对这样的麦田就不要再追施氮素肥料了。磷、钾肥料对充实小麦茎秆、籽粒都有一定作用。增施磷、钾肥料，可以防止倒伏，还可以有助于提高单位产量。草木灰是一种很好的钾肥，在小麦抽穗以前可以追施一定数量的草木灰。
    二、控制麦田里的水分，麦田水分过多也是促成小麦徒长倒伏的一个因素，因此多雨的地区，应当注意清沟排水；不旱的地区可以少浇甚至不浇。在浇水的时间上，也应当选择没风的天气。
    三、剪掉一些麦叶。有些地区对生长过旺过密的小麦采用过这样的办法，并起到一定的抑制作用。有的农业科学机构通过小范围的试验，也认为这是一种抑制徒长的办法。
    在抽穗灌浆以后倒伏的小麦，一般不宜乱动，这样可以避免因乱动而带来的损害。南方地区在多雨地湿的情况下，对已经成熟的倒伏小麦，可以提前抢收，不然压在下面的麦粒就会泡涨发芽。
