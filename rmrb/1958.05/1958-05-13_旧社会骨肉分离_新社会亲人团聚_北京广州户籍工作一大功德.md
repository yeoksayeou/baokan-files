Old Society Separated Families, New Society Reunites Relatives
A Great Merit of Household Registration Work in Beijing and Guangzhou

    (Our Dispatch) The public security organs in Beijing and Guangzhou have done a very good job in household registration work. Now, if anyone wants to find someone who actually lives in these two cities, as long as they know the name, they can go to the police station and find the address in a few minutes. Since the opening of the inquiry service in these two cities in February, they have found the addresses of thousands of people for the public.
    Liu Xuan, a student at Beijing No. 13 Middle School, lost his father before he was even one year old, and his mother left home. For twenty years, he missed his mother day and night. Later, he found out that his mother lived in Beijing, but he didn't know which street she lived on, so he ran to the police station to inquire, and the result was that he found her. One night, an employee of a pharmacy ran to the Suianbo Hutong police station in Beijing in a panic, saying that he had given the wrong medicine to a patient, but he didn't know where the patient lived. The police quickly found the patient's address based on the patient's name he provided. The employee rushed to the patient's home, and if he had been any later, the patient would have taken the wrong medicine. Yang Zhensheng, a citizen of Shanghai, wrote to the Guangzhou Address Inquiry Service to find his cousin Yang Tiesheng, from whom he had been separated for twenty-nine years, and he was also found.
    The masses, after finding the people they were looking for, wrote letters or went to the police station in person to express their gratitude. Zhang Changyu of Beijing Foreign Trade Institute, after finding his younger sister, from whom he had been separated for seventeen years, said: "The old society separated our families, the new society reunited us, and I deeply feel the superiority of the socialist system."
    At present, Shanghai, Tianjin, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin, Chongqing, Xi'an and other cities are also learning from Beijing and Guangzhou's methods to do a good job in household registration work in order to better serve the masses.

　　户籍工作大放异采
　　旧社会骨肉分离　新社会亲人团聚
    北京广州户籍工作一大功德
    本报讯　北京和广州市的公安机关的户籍工作作得很好。现在谁要找寻一个确实住在这两个城市的人，只要知道姓名，到派出所去，几分钟后，就会找到地址。这两个市自2月开办查询以来，已为群众查到了上千人的地址。
    北京市十三中学生刘瑄，不满周岁时，父亲死了，母亲离开了家。二十年来他日夜想念母亲，后来打听到母亲住在北京，但不知住在那条街，就跑到派出所去查，结果查到了。一个夜晚，一家药店店员慌张地跑到北京遂安伯胡同派出所，说是给病人拿错了药，但不知道病人住在哪里。民警根据他说的病人的名字，很快就找到了病人的住址。这个店员飞跑到病人家里，再晚一步，病人就要把药吃错了。上海市民杨振声写信给广州市地址查询服务处，找分别二十九年的堂兄杨铁生，也找到了。
    群众打听到了自己要找的人，纷纷写信或亲自到派出所致谢。北京市对外贸易学院张长玉，在查到离别了十七年的小妹妹后说：“旧社会使我们骨肉分离，新社会使我们重新团聚，我深深体会到社会主义制度的优越性。”
    目前，上海、天津、武汉、沈阳、哈尔滨、重庆、西安等城市也正学习北京广州的办法，做好户籍工作，以便更好地为群众服务。
