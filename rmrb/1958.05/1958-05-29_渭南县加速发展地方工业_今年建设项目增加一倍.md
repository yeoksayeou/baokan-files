Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 28th: The Weinan County Party Committee, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, resolutely implements the general line of socialist construction, and has decided to accelerate the pace of local industrial development, increasing the number of construction projects this year from more than 700 to more than 1,400, and striving to have the county's total industrial output value surpass its total agricultural output value ahead of schedule.

    Weinan County, due to the implementation of the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture this year, has established 496 small factories in the past two or three months. This batch of new factories, covering eleven industries, has begun to serve agricultural production. The 139 brick and tile factories that have been built have produced more than 7.9 million bricks, enabling the timely construction of well walls for 17,000 newly dug wells, which have begun to be used for irrigation. The more than 150 small granular fertilizer plants that have been established have produced nearly one million jin of fertilizer for field application. The 32 small agricultural tool repair and assembly plants established by various townships and communes have not only repaired and assembled several thousand pieces of agricultural tools but have also researched and manufactured small, improved agricultural tools such as winnowers, fertilizer sprayers, corn planting plows, cotton seedling transplanters, and hand-cranked waterwheels.

    In order to further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, the Weinan County Party Committee held a Standing Committee meeting on the 26th, focusing on studying measures to accelerate the pace of local industrial construction. Based on possibilities and needs, they decided to revise the number of small and medium-sized projects to be built this year to more than 1,400, doubling the original plan. It is expected that more than 630 small factories will be established before "July 1st," and the last batch of more than 300 factories will be completed before "October 1st." In discussing the construction of these two batches of factories, special consideration was given to strengthening the construction of the machinery industry, preparing to rapidly build a network for agricultural tool manufacturing and repair, expanding the existing agricultural tool factory, and manufacturing six types of products urgently needed for agriculture, such as portable steam engines, gas engines, small flour mills, and corn threshers.

    渭南县加速发展地方工业
    今年建设项目增加一倍
    新华社西安28日电　中共渭南县委根据八大二次会议精神，坚定不移地贯彻社会主义建设总路线，决定加快地方工业发展的速度，把今年建设项目从七百多个增加到一千四百多个，并争取全县工业总产值提前超过农业总产值。
    渭南县今年由于执行了工农业并举的方针，最近两三个月已办起了四百九十六个小型工厂。这批包括十一个行业的新工厂，已开始为农业生产服务。已建成的一百三十九个砖瓦厂生产出的七百九十多万块砖，使新开的一万七千个水井及时砌成井壁开始灌溉。办起的一百五十多个小型颗粒肥料厂，已制造出近一百万斤肥料给田间施肥。各乡社开办的三十二个小型农具修配厂，除修配了几千件农具外，还研究制造出扬场器、喷肥器、玉米播犁机、移棉苗器和手摇水车等小型改良农具。
    中共渭南县委为了进一步贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，在26日召开了常委会，着重研究了加快地方工业建设速度的措施。根据可能和需要，他们确定把今年建设的中小项目修改成一千四百多个，比原计划增加一倍，预计在“七一”前夕便能再办起六百三十多个小厂，并在“十一”前把最后一批三百多个工厂建成。在讨论建设这两批工厂时，特别考虑到要加强机械工业建设，准备迅速建成一个农具制造和修配网，扩建原有的农具厂，制造农业急需的锅驼机、煤气机、小型面粉机、玉米脱粒机等六种产品。
