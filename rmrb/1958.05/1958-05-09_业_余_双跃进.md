    "Professional" and "Amateur" Both Leap Forward
    Chen Xin
    We live in a mythical age, where the miracles of a single day are enough to fill many epics, dramas, and novels. However, professional literary workers are few. Most people who put pen to paper also have their own primary occupations, busy with planning and setting targets in their work, while also feeling compelled to write something. At this time, if the relationship between "professional" and "amateur" is not handled properly, one can easily be caught in a dilemma, neglecting one for the other.
    The fallacies of "one-book-ism," etc., once occupied a considerable market in the literary and art circles. Although they have been struck down, the lessons were too painful and the poisonous influence too widespread, and it is still easy to associate amateur writing with the pursuit of personal fame and gain. Bourgeois individualism is deeply rooted in intellectuals. The raging fire ignited on big-character posters since the "Double-Anti" campaign was merely "a 'deterrent stick' to bourgeois individualism, knocking down its arrogance" (People's Daily editorial, April 13). To thoroughly burn it through and make it stink requires a lot more in-depth and meticulous work. Therefore, even if people's views on this issue are a bit extreme, such as satirizing amateur writing as "private plots" or "underground factories," I think it can still be forgiven.
    However, this issue cannot be generalized. If "amateur writing" is all denounced as "not attending to one's proper duties," many authors will develop retreatist thoughts and consider giving up amateur writing. If this is the case, it will naturally be detrimental to the socialist literary cause. After all, amateur writers account for the majority in our socialist literary ranks.
    We acknowledge the existence of contradictions between "professional" and "amateur," but they are not like fish and bear's paw, which cannot be obtained at the same time, and one must be sacrificed. The most important thing in dealing with this issue is to put the position right. "Professional" is primary, and "amateur" is secondary. Under the premise of subordinating to "professional," we strive to ensure that "professional" does not exclude "amateur," and "amateur" does not affect "professional." All legitimate "amateur" activities should be supported and encouraged. Because how to better combine "professional" and "amateur" still needs further research, so we only say "strive."
    "'Professional' must leap forward, and 'amateur' must also leap forward!" This is the bold statement of an amateur writer at the capital's creative symposium. I think this truly conforms to the spirit of the Great Leap Forward.

    “业”“余”双跃进
    陈新
    我们生活在神话般的时代，一天的奇迹就够写许多部史诗、戏剧和小说。可是专业的文学工作者很少，动动笔头的人大抵都有自己的正业，工作上忙着搞规划订指标，一面又禁不住想写点东西。这时，如果“业”“余”之间的关系处理不当，就很可能左右为难，顾此失彼。
    “一本书主义”等谬论曾经在文艺界占有相当的市场，虽已被打掉了，但由于教训太沉痛，贻毒太深广，迄今还容易使人从业余写作联想到追求个人名利。资产阶级个人主义思想在知识分子身上扎根极深，“双反”以来大字报上燃起的烈火，只是“给资产阶级个人主义思想来了一顿‘杀威棒’，把威风打了下来”（人民日报4月13日社论）；要把它彻底烧透搞臭，还需要做很多深入细致的工作。所以，人们对这个问题的看法即使有点偏激，如把业余写作讽喻为“自留地”或“地下工厂”，我看还是可以原谅的。
    然而对这问题不能一概而论。如果把“业余写作”都指责为“不务正业”，有许多作者就会产生退坡思想，考虑放弃业余写作。果真如此，对社会主义文学事业自然是不利的。因为在我们的社会主义文学队伍里，业余作者毕竟占大多数。
    我们承认“业”“余”之间存在矛盾，但并非如鱼和熊掌之不可得兼，必须舍弃其一。对待这个问题，最最重要的是把位置摆对。“业”为主，“余”为辅，在服从“业”的前提下，力求“业”不排斥“余”，“余”不影响“业”。一切正当的“余”应该得到支持和鼓励。因为“业”和“余”之间如何更好的结合，尚待进一步研究，所以只说“力求”。
    “‘业’要跃进，‘余’也要跃进！”这是一位业余作家在首都创作座谈会上的豪语，我认为这才真正符合大跃进的精神。
