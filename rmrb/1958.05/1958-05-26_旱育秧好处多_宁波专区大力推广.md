Dryland Nursery Seedlings Offer Many Advantages
Ningbo Prefecture Vigorously Promotes Them

The Ningbo Prefecture of Zhejiang Province has decided to vigorously promote continuous cropping of late rice using dryland nursery seedlings throughout the region this year. The implementation of dryland nurseries in some agricultural cooperatives in the Ningbo area has proven that it has many advantages:

(1) Dryland nursery seedlings grow robustly and are mature, they recover quickly after transplanting, tiller prolifically and uniformly, have long panicles, and many grains, leading to high yields.

(2) The seedlings are easy to pull, easy to pick, and easy to plant, which can greatly improve labor efficiency and facilitate seizing the season.

(3) Land can be fully utilized, increasing the planting area of double-cropping rice.

(4) They mature early and grow fast, which is conducive to the timely sowing of winter crops.

The experience of many regions has proven that the promotion of dryland nurseries can solve problems that have not been solved in continuous cropping of late rice nurseries in recent years, such as weak seedlings, difficulty in pulling seedlings, and slow recovery after transplanting.

    旱育秧好处多
    宁波专区大力推广
    浙江省宁波专区决定今年在全区大力推广连作晚稻旱地育秧。旱地育秧在宁波地区部分农业社里推行结果，证实了有许多优点。
    （1）旱育秧苗生长粗壮老健，移栽后转青快，发棵多而整齐，稻穗长，谷粒多，产量高。（2）秧苗好拔、好挑、好种，可以大大提高劳动效率，有利于争取季节。（3）可以充分利用土地，增加双季稻种植面积。（4）成熟早、生长快，有利于冬季作物的适时播种。
    许多地区经验都证明，推广旱地育秧能解决几年来连作晚稻育秧上所不能解决的如秧苗细弱、秧难拔、插后转青不快等等的问题。
