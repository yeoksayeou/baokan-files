In the past, the situation in the entire Laibin County was: "Don't let your daughter marry a Laibin man, carrying water is like going to heaven, there's nowhere to wash clothes, drinking water is like drinking medicine."
Now, in many places in Laibin: "West Mountain has reservoirs, East Mountain has ponds, water flows from high places, the fragrance of rice flowers fills the land."

Zhang Wenqing, First Secretary of the Laibin County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

　　Having fields without water, nine out of ten crops fail.
　　Yields are low year after year, life is often hard.

Laibin County is a place in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region where there are droughts nine years out of ten, and crop failures nine times out of ten. The county has a population of over 410,000, with the Zhuang people accounting for more than 70%. There are 1.31 million mu of cultivated land and about 1.7 million mu of arable wasteland. Before liberation, out of 130,000 mu of paddy fields, only about 50,000 mu were guaranteed yields. Rainfall is very uneven throughout the year: "In spring, there are clouds but no rain, in summer, torrential mountain floods, in autumn, rainwater is as precious as gold, in winter, the weather is sunny with few clouds." Not only is there no water for irrigating the fields, but about 40% of the villages and settlements have extreme difficulties with drinking water for people and livestock. These villages generally use water for four purposes: washing faces in the morning, taking showers in the evening, washing clothes and feeding cattle and sheep. Even in places where there is water, it is: "Three parts water, seven parts gruel when boiling porridge, white shirts turn yellow." Therefore, the people in the neighboring counties say: "Don't let your daughter marry a Laibin man, carrying water is like going to heaven, there's nowhere to wash clothes, drinking water is like drinking medicine." In addition, the soil is barren, and the yield of the fields is very low. In 1952, a year of favorable weather, the yield of grain per mu was only 146 jin; in 1956, after the realization of cooperation, the yield per mu was only 238 jin. The yield was even lower before liberation, and the people's lives were very hard, generally: "Morning wormwood (wild vegetables), noon congee, and still seeing the moon at night (describing the congee as too thin to see the moon from the bowl)." At that time, the masses relied on "four dependancies" to maintain their lives: first, depending on the weather for rain, second, depending on firewood and charcoal, third, depending on working as hired laborers, and fourth, depending on fleeing to other places to make a living. The mountains and forests were all cut down, resulting in: five days without rain, the fields crack, half a month without rain becomes a disaster, heavy rain causes floods everywhere, and when the rain stops, the mountains dry and the fields also dry. Because the masses lived hard lives and the drinking water was so unclean, Laibin County became a hotbed of disease, with diseases such as malaria, dysentery, diarrhea, and measles occurring every year, seriously affecting the people's health. The masses lamented Laibin's plight: "Droughts harm people and make them lonely, who knows the suffering of repeated illnesses? Tears flow through three layers of mats, digging a pond under the bed to raise fish (referring to crying too much)." After liberation, through land reform and the adoption of various measures to develop production, the people's lives have been significantly improved, but the face of poverty has not been fundamentally changed, and the masses still have "three dependancies": first, depending on the government to allocate grain supplies, second, depending on the government to issue relief funds, and third, depending on loans from the bank.

Is Laibin County a truly barren place? The definite answer: No, Laibin is a good place. It is located in the subtropics, with no frost or little frost in all four seasons (short periods of frost also occur during severe cold waves). The average annual rainfall is about 1,300 millimeters. With water, it can have two or three harvests a year. Can this be said to be a bad place? The root cause of Laibin County's poverty is the lack of water for irrigating the fields. To eradicate drought, Laibin will be like other parts of the motherland, with green mountains, clear waters, fertile land, and abundant resources. Building water conservancy projects, controlling drought, creating forests, and conserving water and soil are the panacea for curing Laibin County's "poverty disease."

　　The entire county fights hard for four months, reservoirs and ponds spread in all directions.
　　Even if the spring drought lasts, we are not afraid, from now on we no longer need to pray to the Dragon King.

In 1956, cooperation was realized, and the masses were no longer relying on the previous "four dependancies," but rather: "Relying on the leadership of the Communist Party, boosting morale; relying on building water conservancy projects to overcome drought; relying on cooperatives to do a good job of collective production." In that year, great efforts were made to build water conservancy projects. The appearance of the places where water conservancy was built has changed. However, from the second half of 1956 to the first half of 1957, a small typhoon blew up, saying "we're rushing ahead," "we're being subjective," "only focusing on the collective, not caring about the individual," "not caring about the sideline occupations of the members of the commune", "building water conservancy projects is too hard." At that time, this wind was very strong, and we resisted some of it, but not completely, which affected our work. The water conservancy projects built in 1957 were reduced compared to 1956. Which is better, the "subjectivity" of 1956 or the anti-"subjectivity" of 1957? Is it better to improve the appearance by building water conservancy projects, or to engage in personal sideline occupations without building water conservancy projects? The vivid comparison of the facts of the two years has deeply educated the masses and awakened them. After conveying the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Party, and after comparing the accounts of 1956 and 1957 and conducting a large-scale debate, from the winter of 1957 to the spring of 1958, a large-scale battle to march towards nature and eliminate drought was launched throughout the county. More than 150,000 people were put into the front-line operations, accounting for 80% of the total labor force. As a result of four months of hard work, the large and small water conservancy projects built can irrigate more than 780,000 mu, which is 14 times more than the water conservancy projects built over the past several thousand years before liberation, and more than twice the total of the water conservancy projects built in the eight years since liberation. A total of more than 14.4 million labor days were used (not including the labor required to support the construction site with the transportation of grain, firewood, lime, cement, steel bars, and other materials), with an average of 90 workdays per worker. A total of more than 11.8 million cubic meters of earthwork and more than 1.56 million cubic meters of stonework were completed, with an average of 83.5 cubic meters of earth and stone work completed per worker. The highest reservoir dam head is 18.5 meters, the longest reservoir dam head reaches 974 meters, the largest reservoir capacity can hold 140 million cubic meters of water, and the longest tunnel through the mountain is 480 meters. In order to build water conservancy projects, 34 natural villages were moved, and 6,223 new houses were built. Twenty-eight rivers were blocked, forcing the river water to change its course; 149 mountain ponds were blocked, storing mountain water; 177 reservoirs were built, forcibly storing rainwater; and more than 360 underground water sources were excavated, allowing water to flow from underground. This year, from spring to the beginning of summer, it has not rained, and 28 of the 36 large and small tributaries of the Hongshui River in Laibin have dried up. Although we encountered an unprecedented spring drought, due to the construction of water conservancy projects, we mobilized the masses to fight drought and rush to transplant rice. By the end of April, we had still transplanted 250,000 mu of early rice, more than double the amount in the same period last year. The masses said: "In the past, we prayed to the Dragon King when there was a drought, and the more we prayed, the more the rice turned yellow; now that we have built large reservoirs, the water is full in the fields and the valleys are full of grain." Now, "Laibin County" has begun to be removed from the drought disaster archives, and its appearance has been preliminarily changed. In order to fundamentally eradicate drought, we must continue to work hard, fight to the end, and never stop until we have completely eliminated drought.

　　Not relying on heaven, not relying on money, not entirely relying on technicians.
　　Relying on the enthusiasm of the masses, it is not difficult to build water conservancy projects well.

The organization of the great battle to build water conservancy projects this past winter and spring began with an irreconcilable debate against right-leaning conservative thinking. Building water conservancy projects, overcoming drought, transforming nature, and marching toward 800 jin—everyone agreed in words and supported it; but when it came to actual action, not everyone's thinking was completely clear, and this was true for both the masses and the cadres. When mobilizing the construction of water conservancy projects in the beginning, six of the fifteen district committee secretaries in the county were not very enthusiastic about building water conservancy projects, thinking that "there is no water to repair." Their "reasons" were: Laibin has barren mountains and deep rivers, and the stratum is complex, with neither water sources nor leakage, so we can only rely on the sky for rain. Seven people were clear in the open but not clear in the dark, and they also had "reasons": the easy-to-repair water conservancy projects have already been repaired, and now all the repairs are hard bones, thinking that there is no money and no technicians. They said: "If we don't rely on heaven, we have to rely on money; we rely not only on leadership, but also on technicians; without money and without personnel (technical cadres), it is difficult to build water conservancy projects." This is a conditionalism of "seeing things but not people." Only two people were "water conservancy enthusiasts," with the right ideas and full of energy. The right-leaning conservative thinking of the water conservancy cadres was even more serious. The masses in the Dawan District planned to build nine reservoirs, but they only approved the construction of two, and also said: "Building more is rushing ahead." For the Beiluo Reservoir, the masses had already broken ground, but the Water Conservancy Section said: "If you build it well, you will not be praised, and if you build it badly, you will be held accountable." From the performance of right-leaning conservative thinking, the above is more serious than the below, the cadres are more serious than the masses, and the insiders (water conservancy technical cadres) are more serious than the outsiders.

The county party committee adopted the method of organizing a large-scale debate and visiting the site to solve ideological problems and boost morale from top to bottom, from cadres to the masses. After organizing a visit to the Dawan District and Guqi District, where water conservancy was well-built, and conducting a debate, the masses concluded that: where there are mountains, there must be water; if there is no surface water, there must be groundwater (Laibin County calls groundwater "Jian water"); if there is no ready-made water, we can accumulate rainwater; if there is no water nearby, we can definitely find water far away. There are 36 rivers in the county that can be used, and underground Jian water is also very abundant. In this spring's fight against drought and rush to transplant rice, more than 360 underground water sources were found in less than a month, which can irrigate more than 70,000 mu. There are even more places where mountain ponds and reservoirs can be built. The pessimistic theory that "there is no water to repair" is completely untenable.

　　Block the river water, dig out the Jian water.
　　Accumulate the rainwater, store the mountain water.

After the great debate, the masses put forward the heroic words: block the river water, dig out the Jian water, accumulate the rainwater, and store the mountain water. After solving the ideological problem of having water conservancy to build, we further solved the ideological problem of implementing the policy of "the commune runs and helps, relies on the masses, and builds water conservancy projects with more, faster, better and more economical results." By calculating the losses from drought, the increased production from water conservancy, and telling the suffering of drought, we inspired the masses and enhanced their understanding. An eighty-year-old man in Dawan District said: "In the past, the suffering was deep and deep, and who cared about fleeing famine and selling children? Chairman Mao called for building water conservancy projects, and the Communist Party led the way to dig up the roots of poverty." Then, we calculated where money was needed for building water conservancy projects and how much money it would cost. After everyone's calculations, the only things that needed to be purchased with money were a small amount of cement and steel bars, and the rest, such as earthwork, stonework, lime, carts, dustpans, etc., could be completely solved by ourselves. In the past, it cost more than 20 yuan per mu to build water conservancy projects, and everything had to be bought with money at that time. If it were still the same as in the past, drought would not be eliminated in ten years. Therefore, we proposed: bring your own tools, burn your own lime, hit your own stone, carry your own earth, raise your own funds, and learn your own skills. We adopted the above-mentioned "six selves" method, and the average cost of water conservancy built per mu was less than 1.2 yuan. With the liberation of thought and the breaking of frames, the movement to build water conservancy projects has been carried out vigorously. The masses proposed at the oath-taking meeting for building water conservancy projects: "Rely on our cooperative, rely on our two hands, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we must force the river water to change its course, force the high mountains to bow their heads, not rely on the sky when it doesn't rain, and build water conservancy projects well for a bumper harvest for ten thousand years."

　　Think of all possible ways, tap all potential, mobilize all manpower, use all materials, and use all financial resources to launch an all-out war against drought.

To command this great battle of building water conservancy projects, we called on: the whole people to mobilize, leaders to take the lead, dare to think and dare to do, and do what we say. We mobilized all cadres and the broad masses to think of all possible ways, tap all potential, mobilize all manpower, use all materials, and use all financial resources to block rivers, block rivers, dig ponds, build reservoirs, open canals, divert water, transform nature, and launch an all-out war against drought. Leading cadres at all levels, together with veteran peasants, carrying dry food, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, taking the lead in stepping on mountains to find water sources. If we couldn't find it in our own township, we went to other townships, and if we couldn't find it in our own county, we went to other counties. For example, the source of the Sanli Reservoir was found in Guixian County. Comrade Mao Shougao, secretary of the Sanlian Township Party Committee, was determined to solve the water conservancy problem of 3,000 mu in the township. He took six warriors, with no rice to eat, carrying sweet potato dried in their bags, and drilled in a stone cave for six days and six nights. From more than 20 miles away, he finally found the outlet (water source). The masses praised him, "Everyone praises Mao Shougao, a socialist hero, with soaring revolutionary ambition, adding merit to the book of merit." Comrade Liu Yaohua, the head of Linglun Township, went back and forth to his house 13 times to build water conservancy projects, but never entered his door. People called him "Living Yu the Great." Many county, district, and township cadres were called "water conservancy enthusiasts" by the masses. Wherever the drought was the worst, the cadres went there to personally help think of ways and give ideas. Therefore, the masses said, "Communist Party members are not afraid of difficulties, and they help block rivers when they see them. They no longer ask for rain from gods when there is a drought, and they are not afraid of floods when it rains continuously." In order to command this battle well, secretaries at all levels went to the front line to serve as construction site commanders or party committee secretaries. Leading cadres lived on the construction site, telephone machines were moved to the construction site, and offices were moved to the construction site. The water conservancy construction site was actually the front-line command post. They commanded on the one hand and participated in labor on the other hand, personally testing earthwork, stonework, excavation, filling, and other work procedures, personally experimenting with various tools, summing up the creativity of the masses, and the leaders personally conducted experiments. If it was successful, they would immediately visit the site, debate, and promote it. In action, the prefectural committee summarized 14 reforms to improve labor efficiency, such as tools and working methods, and we developed them into 32 reforms, such as changing digging soil to plowing soil with cattle, changing carrying soil to transporting soil with pulley carts, and changing eating at home to eating on the construction site... which greatly improved labor efficiency. Some reforms can increase efficiency by more than ten times. When the Spring Festival arrived, the water conservancy project was in tense construction. Secretaries at all levels, county heads, township heads, and office cadres spent the Spring Festival with the masses on the construction site without leaving the front line. The masses not only had no complaints, but more than 30,000 people worked on the water conservancy construction site during the Spring Festival than usual.

　　Poor mountains and poor water, but not poor ambition, transforming nature and showing heroism, eliminating drought and controlling floods is better than Yu the Great, and moving mountains and filling land is better than the Foolish Old Man.

Everywhere cadres took the lead, launched a large-scale debate when encountering ideological obstacles, held Zhuge Liang meetings when encountering difficulties, held on-site meetings for good experiences, visited and promoted them, and praised heroes in a timely manner. The enthusiasm lasted for four months, and the mood was always full. Not only agricultural commune members went to the construction site, but also urban residents went to the construction site, and school teachers and students also went to the construction site to work and express their condolences. The Party, government, army, people, and finance all worked for the victory of the front line, not only supporting the construction site from departmental work, but also automatically proposing to support the earthwork project, expressing their intention to do their best in the great leap forward of socialist construction. Even fortune tellers and diviners ran to the construction site to do earthwork. At the meeting to celebrate the basic completion of water conservancy, the masses sang with joy: "Poor mountains and poor water, but not poor ambition, transforming nature and showing heroism, eliminating drought and controlling floods is better than Yu the Great, and moving mountains and filling land is better than the Foolish Old Man." In many places, a new look has already appeared: "West Mountain has reservoirs, East Mountain has ponds, water flows from high places, and the fragrance of rice flowers fills the land."

　　天不下雨不靠天　有水丰收万万年
　　来宾从前全县情况是：有女莫嫁来宾郎　挑水好比上天堂　有件衣服无处洗　饮水如同喝药汤
　　来宾现在不少地方是：西山有水库　东山有水塘　水从高处走　遍地稻花香
    中共广西僮族自治区来宾县委第一书记　张文卿
    有田没有水　十种九不收
    产量年年低　生活常常苦
    来宾县是广西僮族自治区一个十年九旱、十种九歉的地方。全县四十一万多人口，僮族占70％多。耕地一百三十一万亩，可耕荒地约一百七十万亩。解放前十三万亩水田中，保收田只有五万亩左右。一年中间降雨量很不平衡，“春季有云不下雨，夏季倾盆发山洪，秋季雨水贵似金，冬季晴朗少见云。”不但是田地无水灌溉，而且约有40％的村屯人畜饮水都发生极大的困难。这些村庄一般是一水四用：早洗脸，晚冲凉（洗澡），洗了衣服喂牛羊。就是有水的地方也是：“担水煮粥三分浆，白衫变成黄衣裳。”所以，邻县的群众就说：“有女莫嫁来宾郎，挑水好比上天堂，有件衣服无处洗，饮水如同喝药汤。”加以土质贫瘠，田地产量很低。在风调雨顺的1952年，粮食每亩产量仅有一百四十六斤；1956年实现了合作化，每亩产量也只有二百三十八斤。解放前的产量更低，群众生活很苦，一般的是：“早艾叶（野菜），午稀饭，晚上还是照月亮（形容稀饭太稀，可以从饭碗里见到月亮）。”那时，群众以“四靠”维持生活：一靠天下雨，二靠打柴烧炭，三靠打长工，四靠外逃谋生。山林都砍的光光的，所以造成：五天无雨田干裂，半月无雨就成灾，大雨处处发洪水，雨停山干田也干。由于群众生活苦，饮水又那样的不干净，来宾县便成了病魔的温床，像疟疾、痢疾、腹泻、麻疹等疾病，年年流行，严重地影响着人民的身体健康。群众对来宾这幅困境悲叹着：“旱灾害人几孤凄，重重病苦有谁知？眼泪流穿三层垫，床底挖塘养得鱼（指流泪太多的意思）。”解放以后，经过土地改革和采取发展生产的各项措施，人民生活有了显著改善，但是贫困的面貌并没有根本改变，群众还有“三靠”：一靠政府调粮供应，二靠政府发救济款，三靠向银行贷款。
    来宾县是不是一个真正贫瘠不堪的地方呢？肯定的回答：不是的，来宾是块好地方。这里地处亚热带，四季无霜或少霜（寒潮强烈时也出现极短时间的霜冻），每年平均的降雨量在一千三百公厘左右，有水的话，一年可以两熟或三熟，这能说是块坏地方吗？来宾县的穷根子，就是缺水灌田。根治旱灾，来宾就会同祖国其他地方一样，是山青水秀、土地肥沃、物产富饶的地方了。修水利，治旱灾，造山林，保水土，这是治疗来宾县“穷病”的万灵药方。
    全县苦战四个月　水库水塘遍四方
  　春旱虽久也不怕　从此不再求龙王
    1956年实现了合作化，群众再不是以前的“四靠”了，而是：“靠共产党的领导，鼓起干劲；靠兴修水利，战胜干旱；靠合作社，搞好集体生产。”这一年，大抓了一下兴修水利。水利修起来的地方，面貌就改观了。但是，在1956年下半年到1957年上半年，吹起了一股小台风，说什么“冒进了”，“主观了”，“只抓集体，不顾个体了”，“不顾社员家庭副业了”，“修水利太辛苦了”。当时，这股风很硬，我们顶住了一些，没有完全顶住，使工作受了些影响，1957年兴修的水利就比1956年减少了。究竟是1956年的“主观”好，还是1957年的反“主观”好？是修了水利改善面貌好，还是不修水利闹个人副业好？两年活生生的事实对比，使群众受到了深刻的教育，恍然大悟。经过传达党中央三中全会的精神，又经过1956年和1957年对比算账，开展大辩论，1957年冬到1958年春，在全县范围内，掀起了一个大规模的向自然进军、消灭旱灾的大战斗。全县投入前线作战的有十五万多人，占总劳力的80％。四个月苦战的结果，兴修的大小水利可灌溉七十八万多亩，超过解放前几千年来所修水利的十四倍，超过解放八年来所修水利总和的二倍多。共用了一千四百四十多万个劳动日（支援工地运送粮食、柴草、石灰、洋灰、钢筋和其他各项资材所需劳动未统计在内），平均每个劳动力负担了九十个工作日。共做了一千一百八十多万土方和一百五十六万多石方，平均每个劳动力完成了八十三点五土石方。水库坝首最高的十八点五公尺，水库坝首最长的达九百七十四公尺，库容最大的可容纳一点四亿立方水，穿山隧道最长的四百八十公尺。为了修水利，搬移了三十四个自然村，新建住宅六千二百二十三处。拦了二十八条河，强迫河水改道；堵了一百四十九处山塘，把山水蓄起来；修了一百七十七处水库，硬把天水储起来；挖出三百六十多处地下水，叫水从地下流出来。今年从春季到立夏没有下过雨，红水河在来宾境内的三十六条大小支流，干了二十八条。虽然遇到历来少有的春旱，但是，由于修了水利，发动群众抗旱抢插，到4月底，我们仍然插上早稻二十五万亩，比去年同期增加一倍以上。群众说：“从前天旱求龙王，求来求去禾更黄；如今修了大水库，水满田垌谷满仓。”现在，“来宾县”在旱灾档案簿子里开始消号，面貌初步改观了。为了根治旱灾，我们还必须再接再厉，战斗到底，不彻底消灭旱灾，决不罢休。
    不靠天来不靠钱　也不全靠技术员
　　依靠群众积极性　修好水利并不难
    组织去冬今春兴修水利的大战役，首先是向右倾保守思想，展开了不调和的大辩论。兴修水利，战胜干旱，改造自然，向八百斤进军——口头上人人同意，个个赞成；实际行动起来，每个人的思想并不都是十分通的，群众是如此，干部也是如此。在开始动员兴修水利的时候，全县十五个区委书记中，就有六人对修水利劲头不大，认为“无水可修”。他们的“理由”是：来宾山秃河深，地层复杂，既无水源，又会漏水，只好靠天等雨。有七人明通暗不通，他们也有“理由”：好修的水利早已修完了，现在修的全是硬骨头，认为没有钱，没有技术员不行。他们说：“不靠天，要靠钱；不但靠领导，还靠技术员；一无钱，二无员（技术干部），想修水利难上难。”这是“见物不见人”的唯条件论。只有两个人是“水利迷”，思想对头，干劲十足。水利干部的右倾保守思想更为严重。大湾区群众计划修九处水库，他们只批准修两处，还说：“多修就是冒进。”北洛水库，群众已经破土动工，水利科说：“你们修好了不得表扬，修坏了要追查责任。”从右倾保守思想的表现来看，上面比下面严重，干部比群众严重，内行（水利技术干部）比外行严重。
    县委采用组织大辩论和到现场参观的办法，自上而下，从干部到群众，解决思想问题，鼓起干劲。经过组织参观水利修得好的大湾区和古昔区并进行辩论，群众得出的结论是：有山必有水，没有地上水，必有地下水（来宾县把地下水叫作涧水）；没有现成水，可以积天水；近处没有水，远处一定可以找到水。全县有三十六条河水可以利用，地下涧水也很丰富，在今春抗旱抢插中，不到一个月，就找到地下水三百六十多处，可灌溉七万多亩。可以修筑山塘水库的地方就更多了。那种认为“无水可修”的悲观论是完全站不住脚的。
    把河水拦起来　把涧水挖出来
  　把天水积起来　把山水蓄起来
    经过大辩论，群众提出的豪语是：把河水拦起来，把涧水挖出来，把天水积起来，把山水蓄起来。解决了有水利可修的思想以后，又进一步解决对贯彻执行“社办公助，依靠群众，多快好省”兴修水利方针的思想问题。通过算旱灾损失账，修水利增产账，诉旱灾的苦，启发群众，提高认识。大湾区一位八十岁老人说：“过去痛苦深又深，逃荒卖仔谁关心，毛主席号召修水利，共产党领导挖穷根。”接着，又算修水利到底那里需用钱，要花多少钱？大家算来算去，需要花钱购买的只不过是少量的洋灰和钢筋，其余如土方、石方、石灰、车子、簸箕等等，完全可以自己解决。过去修水利一亩要花二十多元，那时什么都要花钱买，现在如果还和过去一样，十年也消灭不了旱灾。因此，我们提出：工具自己带，石灰自己烧，料石自己打，土方自己挑，资金自己筹，技术自己学。我们采取了上述“六自”办法，所修水利每亩平均还用不到一元二角钱。思想解放了，框子打掉了，兴修水利的运动就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。群众在修水利的誓师大会上提出：“靠我们的合作社，靠我们的两只手，在毛主席领导下，硬要河水改道，强迫高山低头，天不下雨不靠天，修好水利丰收万万年。”
    想尽一切办法　挖掘一切潜力　发动一切人力　运用一切物力　利用一切财力　向旱灾发动总体战
    指挥兴修水利这个大战役，我们号召：全民总动员，领导带头干，敢想敢做，说到做到。我们动员全体干部和广大群众，想尽一切办法，挖掘一切潜力，发动一切人力，运用一切物力，利用一切财力，拦河，堵川，挖塘，筑库，开渠，引水，改造大自然，向旱灾发动总体战。各级领导干部，和老农一起，背着干粮，爬山越岭，带头踏山寻水源。本乡找不到去外乡找，本县找不到去外县找。如三利水库就是从贵县找到水源的。三联乡党委书记毛寿高同志，决心解决该乡三千亩水利，带了六名勇士，没有米吃，背上红薯干，在一个石洞里，钻了六天六夜，从二十多里远处，终于找到了水口（水源）。群众歌颂他，“万众夸奖毛寿高，社会主义逞英豪，革命雄心高万丈，功劳簿上加功劳”。凌沦乡乡长刘耀华同志，为修水利往返家门十三次，均过其门而不入，人们称为“活禹王”。不少县、区、乡干部被群众称为“水利迷”。那里旱的最厉害，干部就到那里去，亲自帮助想办法，出主意。所以，群众说“共产党员不怕难，见到河流帮助拦，天旱不再求神雨，连雨不怕洪水淹”。为了指挥好这个战役，各级书记亲临前线，担任工地指挥长或党委书记。领导干部住在工地，电话机搬去工地，办公室移往工地，水利工地实际上是前线指挥所。他们一面指挥，一面参加劳动，亲手试土方、石方、挖方、填方等工作程序，亲手试验各种工具，总结群众创造，领导动手试验，成功了马上现场参观，辩论推广。在行动中地委总结了工具、工作方法等提高劳动效率的十四项改革，我们又发展为三十二项改革，如改挖土为牛犁土，改挑土为滑车运土，改回家吃饭为工地吃饭……等，大大提高了劳动效率。有的一项改革可提高效率十几倍之多。春节到了，水利工程正在紧张施工中，各级书记、县长、乡长和机关干部都在工地上和群众一起欢度春节，不下火线，群众不但没有怨言，春节期间水利工地还比平时多出工三万多人。
    山穷水穷志不穷　改造自然逞英雄　除旱治涝胜大禹　移山填土赛愚公
    处处干部带头，碰到思想障碍就大辩论，遇到困难就开诸葛亮会，好经验现场会议、参观推广，英雄人物及时表扬，干劲持续四个月，情绪始终饱满。不但农业社员上工地，城镇居民上工地，学校师生也上工地劳动和慰问，党、政、军、民、财一切为了前线胜利，不仅从部门工作支援工地，而且自动提出支援土方工程，表示在社会主义建设大跃进中尽自己的心意。甚至相面的、算卦的也跑去工地搞土方了。在庆祝水利基本完工的大会上，群众欢欣鼓舞地唱道：“山穷水穷志不穷，改造自然逞英雄，除旱治涝胜大禹，移山填土赛愚公。”不少地方已经出现“西山有水库，东山有水塘，水从高处走，遍地稻花香”的新面貌了。
