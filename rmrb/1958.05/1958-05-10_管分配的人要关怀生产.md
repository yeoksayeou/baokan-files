Editorial Notes:

    Those in Charge of Distribution Must Care About Production
    Socialist industry and commerce each have their own division of labor: the former's responsibility is production, and the latter's is distribution. However, the two are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Their goals and interests are aligned, therefore their relationship is one of close cooperation.
    In the high tide of socialist construction, various construction undertakings are advancing by leaps and bounds, and the income of the broad masses of people is gradually increasing. The demand for industrial products is constantly changing: what was not needed in the past is now needed; what was needed little in the past is now needed more; what was needed of general quality in the past is now needed of high quality. However, for industrial departments to adapt to these changing demands and improve production, it takes a process. Therefore, in the relationship between production and demand, production often lags behind actual needs. How can this contradiction be resolved well? From the perspective of commercial departments, it is necessary to cooperate closely with industrial departments and rapidly promote the development of production.
    Today, this newspaper publishes an article about the Tianjin First Commercial Bureau system's staff warmly caring about production, doing everything possible to actively help industrial departments improve product quality and expand new varieties in a very short period of time. Their spirit is touching. The objective situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction requires this cooperation to develop more extensively, deeply, and persistently. We hope to see this spirit of cooperation quickly blossom and bear fruit among all industrial and commercial departments.

### 管分配的人要关怀生产

    管分配的人要关怀生产
    社会主义工业和商业各有分工：前者的职责是进行生产，后者进行分配，但两者又是互相依赖，互相促进的。它们的目标和利益是一致的，因此双方的关系是密切协作的关系。
    在社会主义建设高潮的形势下，各种建设事业突飞猛进，广大人民收入逐渐提高；对工业产品的需求时刻都在发生变化：过去没有的，现在需要了；过去需要少的，现在需要多了；过去需要一般的，现在需要质量高的了。而工业部门为要适应这些需求的变化，改进生产，却需要一个过程，因此在生产和需求关系上，常常表现为生产落后于实际需要。怎样才能很好地解决这个矛盾呢？从商业部门来说，就需要和工业部门密切协作，迅速促进生产的发展。
    今天本报发表的天津市第一商业局系统工作人员热情关怀生产，千方百计地主动帮助工业部门在很短的时间内提高了产品质量，扩大了新的品种。他们这种精神，是令人感动的。社会主义建设大跃进的客观形势要求这种协作更广泛、更深入、更持久地发展下去。我们希望看到这种协作精神很快地在所有工业和商业部门之间开花结果。
