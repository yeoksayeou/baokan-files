Xinhua News Agency, 28th. A large joint observation team composed of Chinese and Soviet scientific workers observed the annular solar eclipse on Hainan Island on April 19th this year. Through close cooperation, the scientific workers of the two countries achieved fruitful results in this observation, obtaining some first-hand data that had not been observed in the past.

The observation of this annular solar eclipse focused on the study of solar radio radiation and adopted the latest technology. With the strong support and enthusiastic assistance of the local Party, government, military, and people, the observation of the annular solar eclipse proceeded very smoothly. All instruments obtained satisfactory results. The most advanced astronomical telescope—the radio telescope—successfully recorded solar radiation during the annular solar eclipse, as well as the shape and polarization of the radio sun, all of which are first-hand data.

Preliminary analysis of the materials has already led to some rather important conclusions. For example, it confirmed the phenomenon of "limb brightening" of the sun in centimeter and millimeter waves, and confirmed that there is circular polarization in sunspot radiation, and the amount of polarization varies with wavelength. Other findings include the radiation temperature of sunspots in various bands, the ellipticity of the radio sun, and so on. Many of these have never been observed before. The results of this observation provide important materials for the study of the solar chromosphere and sunspots, thereby making an important contribution to understanding solar physics and the relationship between the sun and the earth.

The scale of this radio astronomy annular solar eclipse observation was unprecedented in astronomical history. The successful completion of the mission once again demonstrated the great power of cooperation between Chinese and Soviet scientific workers.

    中苏科学工作者合作观察日环食
    获得第一手资料
    新华社28日讯　由中苏两国科学工作者组成的一支庞大的联合观测队伍，今年4月19日在海南岛对日环食进行了观测。在这次观测中，两国科学工作者的紧密合作取得了丰富的成果，获得了一些第一手的过去没有观察到过的资料。
    这次对日环食的观测以对太阳射电辐射的研究为重点，采用了最新的技术。在当地党政军民的大力支援和热情帮助之下，日环食的观测进行得十分顺利。全部仪器都获得了令人满意的结果，最先进的天文望远镜——射电望远镜成功地记录下了日环食时间中太阳辐射量，射电太阳的形状、偏振等，这些都是第一手的资料。
    在材料的初步分析中已经可以得出某些相当重要的结论，例如，肯定了太阳在厘米和毫米波的“临边增亮”的现象，肯定了太阳黑子辐射存在着圆偏振，偏振量随着波长而变化；其他如在各个波段中黑子的辐射温度、射电太阳的椭率等等。其中有许多是以前从来没有观测到的。这次观测的结果对于太阳色球层和太阳黑子的研究提供了重要的材料，从而对于太阳物理和太阳与地球的关系的了解将作出重要的贡献。
    这次射电天文日环食观测的规模，在天文史上是空前的。任务的胜利完成又一次显示了中苏两国科学工作者合作的伟大力量。
