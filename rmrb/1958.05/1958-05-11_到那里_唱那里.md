　　Sing Where You Go
    In the past two months, the Shanxi People's Song and Dance Troupe has traveled to all the counties in the Changzhi Special Zone of Shanxi Province, performing 3,120 shows. During this period, they performed, worked, and tutored mass cultural activities, and also wrote, rehearsed dozens of short and concise dramas reflecting the actual life of farmers in various places. They put forward the slogan "Sing Where You Go", and rehearsed new dramas in the form of local folk songs every time they arrived in a village. In Dongcun, Qin County, they saw farmers working intensely on the Xuyang River water conservancy project, so they wrote the opera "Cut Off the Xuyang River" and performed it to the farmers on the spot. They were welcomed by farmers everywhere.

　　到那里　唱那里
    山西人民歌舞团在最近两个月中，走遍了山西长治专区所有的县份，演出了三千一百二十场。在这段时间里，他们一面演出，一面劳动，一面辅导群众文艺活动，还编写、排演了几十个反映各地农民实际生活的短小精悍的剧目。他们提出“到那里，唱那里”的口号，每到一个村就以当地民歌的形式排演新剧目。他们在沁县东村，看到农民正在徐阳河水利工地上紧张地劳动，便编写出“斩断徐阳河”的歌剧，当场向农民表演。他们到处受到农民的欢迎。
