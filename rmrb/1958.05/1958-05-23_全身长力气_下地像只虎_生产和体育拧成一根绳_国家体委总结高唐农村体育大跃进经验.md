Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd: Can rural sports leap forward? The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission recently answered this question affirmatively at a rural sports work on-site conference held in Gaotang County, Shandong Province. This conference summarized and introduced the experience of Gaotang County, Shandong Province, in carrying out rural sports activities. The seventy-three representatives from six special districts and forty-eight counties in the four provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Shandong, after on-site visits and discussions, unanimously agreed that Gaotang's experience solved the fundamental problems of the need and ability for rural sports to leap forward, and also pointed out the direction for carrying out rural sports activities.

The later stage of the conference was moved to Beijing, presided over by Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the Physical Culture and Sports Commission, to further study and affirm the experience of Gaotang County in carrying out rural sports activities.

Before liberation, Gaotang County basically had no sports activities other than martial arts activities in individual villages. By 1957, only three rural sports associations had been established in the county, with a total of 436 members. This county, in this year's production Great Leap Forward, carried out activities that closely combined sports with production, actively making sports serve production, and thus sports also achieved a leap forward development. In just a few days at the end of March, all twenty townships and one hundred and twenty-seven agricultural production cooperatives in the county established sports associations. Furthermore, 1,309 sports groups were established within the production teams, and membership has grown to 32,281. Now every township and cooperative in the county has sports grounds, and more than 41,000 people have participated in sports activities.

The conference believed that the following three basic experiences obtained by Gaotang County are the key to rapidly developing rural sports activities. The first is to twist production and sports into one rope. The guiding ideology of the county's Party committees at all levels and administrative leaders in making sports serve and promote agricultural production has been further clarified and strengthened in the process of the production Great Leap Forward. Although sports serving production had been promoted many times before, many people still doubted it due to a lack of practical activities. The arrival of a new production upsurge has brought unprecedentedly favorable conditions for carrying out rural sports activities. Last winter, labor was extremely intense during water conservancy construction, but when it came to rest, the commune members sang and jumped to their hearts' content. Cultural and sports activities brought them labor joy and eliminated fatigue. The example of Wuhuayuan Village, where patriotic health campaigns and sports activities have been carried out well for several years, has further proved the benefits of sports. The incidence of disease in this village has dropped from 13.2% of the total population in 1951 to 1.5% in 1957; and the attendance rate has also increased significantly. Young people reflected: "In the past, working in the fields was like a sheep, now working in the fields is like a tiger"; the elderly said: "Doing morning exercises is to exhale the stale air and breathe in the fresh air, the whole body grows strength."

The result of the close combination of sports and production has brought about a new atmosphere of "five changes" in production: going to the fields late changes to going to the fields early; scattered going to the fields changes to orderly going to the fields; slow work changes to fast work; low work quality changes to high work quality; depressed spirit changes to invigorated spirit.

The second experience is: the combination of leadership and the masses, the leadership of the Party committee, the secretary takes command, unified arrangements. When carrying out rural sports activities, the county put forward the four-level (county, township, cooperative, team) responsibility system, emphasizing three grasps: grasp planning, propose measures; grasp ideology, strive for advancement; grasp evaluation and inspection, continue to boost morale. Leading cadres personally participate in sports, which not only promotes work but also connects with the masses. Xing Jinling, Secretary of the Gaotang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, participated in three training programs.

The county also conscientiously implemented the principle of "running sports diligently and thriftily" in carrying out rural sports activities. Their slogan is "Young people are strong when they get to work, blacksmiths and carpenters come to help, you push me pull and fill the pits, build a sports field overnight." The Jiu Chengxiang Wuai Agricultural Cooperative used this revolutionary method to build a small sports field overnight and solved all the sports equipment. All 385 existing sports fields in the county were built by commune members in their spare time, and 80% of the sports equipment was made by themselves.

The third experience is: comprehensive blooming, striving for advancement, and thorough ideological education. Gaotang County first solved the ideological problems of township and cooperative cadres who believed that sports hindered production through full-scale debate, and used concrete and vivid facts to publicize the purpose and benefits of carrying out sports activities among the masses. After vigorous publicity, the masses realized the benefits of sports. Secondly, break conservatism, eliminate superstition, and mobilize the elderly and women to participate in sports activities. This is not only their urgent demand, but also powerfully promotes and supports young people to participate in exercise. (Attached picture)

    全身长力气　下地像只虎
    生产和体育拧成一根绳
    国家体委总结高唐农村体育大跃进经验
    据新华社22日讯　农村体育运动能不能跃进？国家体育运动委员会最近在山东省高唐县召开的农村体育工作现场会议作了肯定的回答。这次会议，总结和介绍了山东省高唐县开展农村体育运动的经验，参加会议的山西、河北、河南、山东四个省六个专区、四十八个县的七十三名代表，经过现场参观和座谈后一致认为，高唐的经验，解决了农村体育运动需要和能够跃进的根本问题，也指出了怎样开展农村体育运动的方向。
    这次会议后期移到北京举行，由体育运动委员会副主任荣高棠主持，进一步研究和肯定了高唐县开展农村体育运动的经验。
    高唐县在解放以前除个别村有武术活动外，基本上没有其他的体育活动。到1957年，全县也仅建立了三处农村体育协会，会员共四百三十六名。这个县在今年的生产大跃进中，开展了体育与生产紧密结合的活动，积极使体育服务于生产，因而体育也得到了飞跃的发展。在3月底的短短几天内，全县二十个乡、一百二十七个农业生产合作社，就全部建立了体育协会，还在生产队内建立了一千三百零九个体协小组，会员已发展到三万二千二百八十一人。现在全县乡乡社社都有运动场，并已有四万一千多人参加了体育活动。
    会议认为，高唐县取得的以下三条基本经验，是迅速开展农村体育运动的关键。首先是生产与体育拧成一根绳。这个县中共各级党委和行政领导使体育运动服务并促进农业生产的指导思想是在生产大跃进的过程中进一步明确和坚定下来的。以前虽然多次宣传体育为生产服务，但由于缺乏实际活动，很多人还是怀疑的。新的生产高潮的到来，给开展农村体育运动带来了空前有利的条件。去年冬季在兴修水库中，劳动极为紧张，但一到休息时，社员们都尽情地唱歌和蹦跳，文娱体育活动给他们带来了劳动的愉快，消除了疲劳。几年来爱国卫生运动和体育活动开展较好的武花园村的事例，更证明了体育运动的好处。这个村的患病率已由1951年占总人口的13.2％，下降到1957年的1.5％；出勤率也有了显著提高。青年们反映：“过去下地像绵羊，现在下地像只虎”；老年人说：“作早操是出浊气换新气，全身长力气”。
    体育运动与生产紧密结合的结果，已使生产上出现了“五变”的新气象：下地晚变下地早；下地零散变下地整齐；干活慢变干活快；干活质量低变干活质量高；精神消沉变精神振奋。
    第二条经验是：领导与群众相结合，党委领导，书记挂帅，统一安排，这个县在开展农村体育运动时，提出了四长（县、乡、社、队）负责制，强调了三抓：抓规划，提出措施；抓思想，力争上游；抓评比检查，继续鼓干劲。领导干部亲自参加运动，既推动了工作又联系了群众，中共高唐县委书记邢金岭就参加了三个锻炼项目。
    这个县开展农村体育运动，还认真贯彻执行了“勤俭办体育”的原则。他们的口号是“青年动手力量强，铁匠木匠来帮忙，你推我拉把坑垫，一夜修个运动场”。旧城乡五爱农业社就是用这种革命的办法，一夜修成了一个小型运动场，并解决了全部体育器材。全县现有的三百八十五个运动场，都是社员们用业余时间修建的，80％的体育用品也都是自己亲手制造的。
    第三条经验是：全面开花，力争上游，思想教育搞深搞透。高唐县通过充分大辩论的方法，首先解决了乡、社干部认为体育妨碍生产等思想问题，并在群众中用具体生动的事实，宣传开展体育运动的目的和好处，经过大力宣传，群众都认识到体育的好处。其次是打破保守、破除迷信，发动老年人和妇女参加体育活动。这不仅是他们的迫切要求，同时也有力地推动和支持了青年参加锻炼。（附图片）
