　　Radio Station Built on the Grassland

　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 24th – The first wired radio station on the Inner Mongolian grassland was established in the Jin Xing (Golden Star) pastoral cooperative in the Darhan Muminggan United Banner of Ulanqab League in mid-May.

　　This cooperative, composed of thirty-one Mongolian herdsmen households, now has thirteen households settled in the fixed settlement area. All of these members' yurts have been equipped with loudspeakers. When the radio station first broadcasted the Mongolian language program of the Inner Mongolia People's Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 16th, the members were so happy that they jumped for joy.

　　The radio station now broadcasts weather forecasts, animal husbandry production knowledge, and news and entertainment programs to the members every day. In the future, the cooperative committee will also use it to talk to the members or hold meetings.

　　This radio station was established with the help of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Broadcasting Administration. More than 500 such radio stations will be built in Inner Mongolia this year. The focus of station establishment is on pastoral areas, mountainous areas, and remote areas that lack electricity.

    草原上建起广播站
    新华社呼和浩特24日电　内蒙古草原上的第一座有线广播站，5月中旬在乌兰察布盟达尔罕茂明安联合旗的金星牧业社里建立起来。
    这个由三十一户蒙古族牧民组成的合作社，现在留住在定居地上的有十三户社员。这些社员的蒙古包里，已全部安上了喇叭。广播站在16日晚上第一次转播内蒙古人民广播电台的蒙语节目时，社员们高兴得欢跳起来。
    这个广播站现在每天向社员们播送天气预报、畜牧业生产知识和新闻文娱节目。今后社委会还要利用它同社员通话或开会。
    这座广播站是由内蒙古自治区广播管理局帮助建立的。像这样的广播站，今年在内蒙古将要兴建起五百多个。设站重点是缺乏电源的牧区、山区和边远地带。
