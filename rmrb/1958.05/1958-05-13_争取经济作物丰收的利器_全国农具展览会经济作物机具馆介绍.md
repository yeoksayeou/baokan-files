　　A Powerful Tool for Winning a Bumper Harvest of Economic Crops
　　——Introduction to the Economic Crop Machinery Hall of the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition
　　By our reporter Su Qun

The Economic Crop Machinery Hall displays more than 260 pieces of special agricultural tools for planting various economic crops, including tools for planting cotton, hemp, tobacco, sugarcane, sugar beets, vegetables, and fruits, as well as tools for silkworm and bee raising, and tea processing tools. Most of these agricultural tools are new things that were rarely seen in rural areas in the past, and 58 of them are completely created by the masses.

Of course, in terms of silkworm and tea production, the old silk and tea producing areas of China had quite complete silkworm and tea production tools. In terms of vegetables and horticulture, vegetable and fruit farmers in suburban areas also had quite complete horticultural tools. However, planting cotton, hemp, sugar crops, etc., although has a long history, rarely had special agricultural tools. After cooperativization, agricultural production cooperatives gradually equipped themselves with more complete agricultural tools, and also gradually equipped themselves with some new special agricultural tools. Therefore, many of the things exhibited in the Economic Crop Machinery Hall are uncommon new things.

In this hall, people first see that our agricultural production cooperatives now have a complete set of cotton planting tools from planting to harvesting. Why is it that this year our country's cotton is planted so much, so fast, and so well? People can find the answer in the Economic Crop Machinery Hall of the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition.

In this hall, the masses have improved and created the most tools for sowing cotton. Here are various special cotton sowing drills and seeders, nutrient pot makers for cultivating cotton seedlings, seedling transplanters for transplanting cotton seedlings, weeding hoes and fertilizer application tools for cotton fields, cotton root cutting tools, and various tools for pulling cotton stalks. People can see from here how farmers are improving and creating tools in various ways to increase cotton production in order to provide the country with more industrial raw materials and increase income.

Cotton seeders come in single-row, double-row, three-row, and four-row versions, some with wooden structures and some with semi-wood and semi-iron structures. The single-row cotton seeder manufactured in Jiangsu and Hubei can be intercropped in wheat rows and can complete four processes of ditching, sowing, covering soil, and compacting soil at one time. This seeder is operated by two people and can sow 13 to 15 mu per day. The wooden double-row seeder created by Liu Chao and others of Fengshou No. 5 Cooperative in Xianyang, Shaanxi, can sow 25 to 30 mu per day, and the seedlings emerge neatly and grow vigorously, producing 15 jin more ginned cotton per mu than plowing and sowing. The flat-push double-row seeder manufactured in Jiangxi can sow 35 to 40 mu per day, increasing efficiency by 20 times compared to manual sowing. Shandong Province installed a depth adjustment wheel on the old drill, costing only two yuan in labor and materials. By adjusting the adjustment wheel according to the sowing depth, the sowing depth is consistent, and the seedlings emerge two or three days earlier than those sown with the old drill. The Jinxi Tractor Station in Liaoning Province added a fertilizer box behind the sowing box, which can sow and fertilize at the same time. The Agricultural Machinery Tractor Station in Ningjin County, Hebei, modified the seed discharger so that it can sow soybeans and other crops in addition to cotton. Visitors said: From these seeders, we can fully see how rich the genius and wisdom of our working people are.

The masses have also made many improvements and creations in tools for pressing nutrient pots and tools for transplanting seedlings. There are single-cylinder, double-cylinder, four-cylinder, and multi-cylinder tools for making nutrient pots. Pressing nutrient pots and cultivating cotton seedlings is an advanced Soviet experience, which can make cotton mature earlier, increase yield, increase the multiple cropping index, and alleviate the shortage of labor. The square seedling raising tool manufactured by Duan Yumei of Niujing Farm in Binchuan County, Yunnan Province, can be held by two people for 12,000 pieces a day, increasing efficiency by more than four times compared to raising seedlings and transplanting them in seedbeds. In the main cotton producing areas of Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hebei, Shanxi and other provinces, the use of transplanters to fill missing seedlings increases efficiency by one time compared to manual transplantation. At present, the cotton areas in the Yellow River Basin are using various transplanters to carry out seedling replenishment work.

After the cotton grows up, the masses have also created tools for hoeing, fertilizing, and earthing up. The three-toothed light hoe manufactured in Hubei Province can hoe 15 to 20 mu of cotton land per day, is simple and light, and saves labor in transportation and operation. The single-handled hoe, earthing up, and ditching machine manufactured by the Beijing Agricultural Experiment Station is operated by one person and pulled by one animal, and can weed 20 to 30 mu of cotton fields per day, and can also ditch and earth up, and also apply fertilizer.

The cotton root cutter manufactured by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps is shaped like a human character and looks very simple, but it is of great significance. Using it to perform root cutting treatment during the cotton maturity period can promote the cotton to fluff more and increase the ratio of pre-frost flowers, providing the country with more and more valuable ginned cotton. A farm under this corps carried out root cutting treatment on more than 25,700 mu of cotton fields, and the pre-frost flowers generally reached more than 95%, which was 15% higher than the originally expected pre-frost flower ratio.

The masses have also made many improvements and creations in agricultural tools for planting tobacco, hemp, and sugar crops. The tobacco roller strip seeder created by the Tobacco Experiment Station in Fengyang County, Anhui Province, is made of iron sheet and bamboo tube for the roller, and the tie rod is made of wood. One person pulling it can sow a three-foot wide seedbed for 60 zhang per hour, which is three times faster than manual sowing, and is conducive to cultivating strong seedlings, with uniform rows of seedlings, which facilitates ventilation. The triangular seedling setting tool created in Changge County, Henan Province, can be pushed by one person to dig two rows of planting holes, and the plant spacing and row spacing reach triangular seedling setting, which is three times higher than manual digging. The ramie seeder manufactured in Dongguan County, Guangdong Province, is very popular among the audience here, and a farmer representative has drawn a diagram to prepare for imitation. It can sow six mu per day, which is 15 to 20 times faster than manual labor. The seeder is very small and easy to operate, and can complete ditching, sowing, soil covering, soil leveling, and row marking at one time.

The small hoe used for cutting sugarcane from Guangdong and Fujian looks very ordinary, but using it to cut sugarcane is one inch lower than cutting with a sickle, and the average yield can be increased by 400 jin of sugarcane per mu. If the country's sugarcane is calculated at 3.8 million mu, how much sugarcane will be increased!

Here, people can also see the tools for raising silkworms and bees, tea processing tools, and tools for planting fruit trees and vegetables that the masses have improved and created in various places. The simple silkworm raising platform designed by the Zhenjiang Sericulture Research Institute in Jiangsu Province facilitates feeding mulberry leaves and removing sand to the silkworms. Compared with raising silkworms with bamboo dustpans, it saves 14% of labor, and the cost is 80% lower than that of general silkworm raising equipment. The narrator told me: Many silkworm farmers are very interested in the simple silkworm raising platform, drew diagrams, and are preparing to imitate it. The green tea processing machine (for frying tea) manufactured in Qimen County, Anhui Province, can process 64 jin of green tea every eight hours, which is eight times higher than manual green tea processing. The water-powered four-barrel tea kneading machine created by a tea farmer in the county is driven by water power, and can produce 600 jin of dry tea per day, which is nine times higher than manual tea kneading. The vegetable seeder created by Dong Tianhui of Nanda Yuanlian Village Cooperative in Baoding City, Hebei Province, has viewers pushing and testing it every day, or drawing diagrams to prepare for imitation. This single-row Chinese cabbage seeder can complete the processes of ditching, sowing, and soil leveling at one time, which is 50%—70% higher than the old-fashioned broadcast sowing, saves more than 66% of labor, and is easy to operate, costing only one yuan and five jiao.

　　争取经济作物丰收的利器
    ——全国农具展览会经济作物机具馆介绍
    本报记者　苏群
    经济作物机具馆陈列着二百六十多件种植各种经济作物的专用农具，包括种植棉花、麻类、烟叶、甘蔗、甜菜、蔬菜、水果的农具，养蚕、养蜂的用具和制茶工具等等。这些农具绝大部分是过去农村里很少见的新东西，其中有五十八件完全是群众创造的。
    当然，在养蚕、制茶方面，旧中国的蚕区和茶区就有相当完备的养蚕、制茶工具了。在蔬菜等园艺方面，城郊区的菜农和果农也有相当完备的园艺农具。但是种植棉花、麻类、糖料等作物，尽管历史悠久，都很少有专用农具。合作化后，农业生产合作社才逐步配备着较齐全的农具，也逐步配备了一些新的专用农具。所以经济作物机具馆展出的许多东西都是不常见的新东西。
    在这个馆里，人们首先看到：现在，我们农业生产合作社已经有了从种棉到收获的一整套植棉农具了。今年我国的棉花种得又多又快又好，原因何在呢？人们在全国农具展览会经济作物机具馆里，可以找到答案。
    在这个馆里，群众改进和创造最多的是播种棉花用的工具。这里有各种播种棉花专用的耧和播种机，有培育棉苗用的营养钵制造器，有移植棉苗用的移苗器，有用于棉田的耘锄和追肥的工具，有断棉根用的断根器，还有拔棉秆用的各式工具。人们从这里可以看出农民们为了向国家提供更多的工业原料，为了增加收入，怎样从各个方面改进和创造工具，提高棉花产量的。
    棉花播种器有单行、双行、三行和四行的，有的是木制结构，有的是半木半铁的。江苏和湖北制造的单行棉种器可以在麦行中套作，而且一次可以完成开沟、播种、复土和压土四道工序。这种播种器用两个人操作，一天可以播种十三亩到十五亩。陕西咸阳丰收五社刘超等创造的木质双行播种器，每天可以播种二十五亩到三十亩，而且出苗齐、生长旺，每亩可比犁播多产十五斤皮棉。江西制造的平推式双行播种器，每天可以播种三十五亩到四十亩，比人工点播提高效率二十倍。山东省在旧耧上安装一副深浅调节轮，只花了工料费二元。把调节轮按播种的深浅调节好，播种深浅一致，比旧耧播种的早两三天出齐苗。辽宁省锦西拖拉机站，在播种箱后加装了施肥箱，可以同时播种和施肥。河北宁津县农业机械拖拉机站改装了排种器，使它除能播棉花外，还可播种大豆等作物。参观者说：从这些播种机上可以充分的看到我国劳动人民的天才和智慧是多么的丰富。
    压制营养钵的工具和移苗用的工具，群众也有很多的改进和创造。做营养钵的工具有单筒、双筒、四筒和多筒的。压制营养钵，培育棉苗，是苏联的先进经验，它可以使棉花提早成熟，增加产量；增加复种指数，还可以缓和劳动力的不足。云南省宾川县牛井农场段玉美制造的方格育苗器，两个人一天能托一万两千个，比原来用苗床育苗移栽提高效率四倍多。在主要的产棉区山东、河南、安徽、河北、山西等省，使用移苗器补缺苗，比用手移植提高效率一倍。现黄河流域棉区正用各种移苗器进行补苗工作。
    棉花生长起来后，如何锄草、施肥、培土，群众也创造了工具。湖北省制造的三齿轻便耘锄，每天可锄棉地十五亩到二十亩，简单轻便，搬运和操作省力。北京市农业试验站制造的单柄耘锄、培土、开沟器，一人操作一畜牵引，每天可耘锄二十亩到三十亩棉田的草，并可开沟培土，还可追肥。
    新疆建设兵团制造的棉花断根器是人字形的，看着很简单，可是意义很大。用它进行棉花成熟期断根处理，可促使棉花更多的吐絮，提高霜前花的比率，为国家提供更多更有价值的皮棉。这个兵团所属的一个农场在二万五千七百多亩棉田进行成熟期断根处理，一般霜前花达到95％以上，比原预计的霜前花提高比率15％。
    种植烟叶、麻和糖料作物的农具，群众也有很多的改进和创造。安徽省凤阳县烟草试验站创造的烟草滚筒条播机，滚筒由铁皮和竹筒制成，拉杆由木做成，一人拉着每小时可播三尺宽苗床六十丈，比手播快三倍，又利于培育壮苗，苗均匀成行，便利通风。河南省长葛县创造的三角定苗器，由一人推着可挖两行栽植穴，烟株距和行距达到三角定苗，比人工挖穴高三倍。广东省东莞县制造的黄麻播种机，在这里很受观众的欢迎，有个农民代表划图样准备仿造。用它每天能播种六亩，比人工快十五倍至二十倍。播种机很小巧，便于操作，而且一次可以完成开沟、播种、复土、平土和划行。
    来自广东和福建的砍蔗用的小锄头，看来很普通，但用它砍甘蔗要比镰刀割的低一寸，每亩平均可增产四百斤甘蔗，全国甘蔗若以三百八十万亩计算，该增产多少甘蔗呀！
    人们在这里，还可以看到各地群众改进和创造的养蚕、养蜂工具，茶叶加工工具，种植果树和蔬菜的工具。江苏省镇江蚕业研究所设计的简易养蚕台，便于向蚕喂桑、除沙。比用竹制簸箕养蚕节省劳动力14％，成本较一般的蚕具降低80％。讲解员告诉我：有很多蚕农对简易养蚕台很感兴趣，划了图样，准备仿制。安徽省祁门县制造的杀青机（炒茶用），每八小时可杀青六十四斤茶叶，比人工杀青提高八倍。该县一个茶农创造的水力四桶揉茶机，用水力冲击带动，每天可出干茶六百斤，比人工揉茶提高效率九倍。河北省保定市南大元联村社董天惠创造的蔬菜播种机，每天都有观众推动试验试验，或是划图准备仿造。这种单行白菜播种机，一次可以完成开沟、播种、平土工序，比旧式撒播高50％—70％，节省劳动力66％以上，操作轻便，造价只一元五角。
