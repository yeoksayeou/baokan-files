Notes

    Such a "Peace Angel"
    Thomas Finletter, former Secretary of the Air Force under the Truman administration and now a Democratic candidate for Senator from New York, recently offered a clever plan to American rulers in his new book "Foreign Policy" on how to win over Asians. He advocated that the State Department should make every effort to prove that the United States desires peace and is willing to pursue the "sincere goal of avoiding war" together with the people of Asia and other peoples.
    When the deadly smoke of American nuclear weapons tests is filling the skies over the Pacific, when American planes are indiscriminately bombing peaceful residents in Indonesian ports,... this Democratic politician wants the US State Department to act as a "peace angel" in front of Asians, which is obviously a complete mismatch.
    In fact, Finletter has his own explanation for the United States acting as a "peace angel." In his new book, he also advocated "establishing American military hegemony by strengthening the Strategic Air Force" and also suggested establishing a standby emergency force to deal with "local conflicts."
    This is certainly not the language of a "peace angel," but rather the "big stick policy" speaking again.

    如此“和平天使”
    曾任杜鲁门政府空军部长、现在是美国民主党纽约州参议员候选人的托马斯·芬勒特最近在他的新著“外交政策”一书中向美国统治者提出了一条笼络亚洲人的妙计。他主张国务院要尽一切努力去证明美国是希望和平的，是愿意和亚洲人民以及其他人民一道追求“避免战争的真诚目的”。
    当太平洋上空正弥漫着美国核武器爆炸试验的致命烟云的时候，当美国飞机在印度尼西亚港口滥炸和平居民的时候，……这位民主党政客要美国国务院在亚洲人面前装扮作“和平天使”，显然是驴头不对马嘴。
    其实，芬勒特对美国充当“和平天使”是有他自己的解释的。他在新著中同时主张“通过加强战略空军来建立美国的军事霸权，并且还建议建立一支备用的紧急部队来应付“局部冲突”。
    这当然不是什么“和平天使”的语言，而是“大棒政策”又在说话了。
