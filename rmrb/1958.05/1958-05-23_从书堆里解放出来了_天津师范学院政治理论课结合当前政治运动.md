Liberated from Piles of Books
Tianjin Teachers College Political Theory Course Combined with Current Political Movement

(Our newspaper correspondent Zhu Zemin reports) Tianjin Teachers College’s Political Education Department teachers have liberated their thinking and found a way to closely integrate political theory teaching with the current political movement and students’ ideological reality, serving the current political movement. This has transformed the political theory course into a living Marxist-Leninist textbook, possessing both systematicness and scientific accuracy, as well as combativeness and realism.

This reform was first initiated by Zuo Jian, the head of the Political Education Department, while teaching "Modern History of the Chinese Revolution." In March of this year, just as the Two-Anti movement in the school entered the stage centered on ideological transformation, the "Modern History of the Chinese Revolution" course also began to cover the "1942 Rectification Movement." While preparing the lesson, Zuo Jian felt that this lecture must be combined with the current rectification movement. But how to combine it? At the beginning, he only paid attention to changes in method. For example, in the past, teachers lectured and students listened, and there was little discussion in connection with current issues. This time, after lecturing on the first lesson, "The Nature and Process of the 1942 Rectification," he assigned documents for students to study independently, raised six thought-provoking questions, and launched a debate among students, combining it with examining their own thoughts. This change in method was welcomed by the students, but they felt that the main problems addressed in the 1942 Rectification were subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party jargon, while the main problem existing among students at present was individualism. In their ideological examination, they felt that the course lectures were not connected to their own ideological reality. Therefore, Zuo Jian felt that changes in method alone were not enough and that reforms must also be carried out in content. Zuo Jian began to delve into the students’ lives, liberate himself from piles of books, participate in students’ Party and League meetings and discussions, and talk with students in the dormitories, modifying the original teaching plan based on the students’ thoughts and demands. When lecturing on the second lesson, "The Significance, Purpose, and Guiding Principles of the Rectification," he explained it in light of the students' vague understanding and ideological concerns, making this lesson both the second lesson of the "1942 Rectification Movement" course and a mobilization report for ideological examination. This made the students feel that it was very relevant to their own ideological reality. After a day or two, students throughout the department posted big-character posters to examine their own thoughts. However, during the students’ ideological examination, new problems were discovered: some exposed their thoughts more thoroughly, some discarded old burdens but shouldered new ones, some opened their burdens but had not yet put them down, and some did not dare to expose their thoughts. This showed that students lacked a correct understanding of their own mistakes. Therefore, in response to this ideological situation, he lectured on the third lesson: "The Issue of Rectification Attitude." This lecture was very popular among students, and everyone felt that it had timely resolved their own ideological problems. Some said, "In the past, I didn't have any ideological struggle while listening to revolutionary history classes, but this time, while listening to the class, the struggle unfolded in my own mind." Some said, "This way of lecturing not only solves ideological problems, but also makes me understand how theoretical teaching should be linked to ideological reality." The more common reflection was: "In the past, I always listened to revolutionary history as a history class, but this lecture feels like a political class."

Zuo Jian said that this reform was also a rectification for himself, rectifying the tendency of political theory teachers to detach themselves from the current political movement and from ideological reality. In the past, when he lectured on revolutionary history, his view of combining political theory courses with reality and serving the political movement was to add some new examples to the lecture notes, connecting with reality when possible, and lecturing according to the original lecture notes when not possible. In this reform, he also had some concerns: first, he was afraid that this way of lecturing would not resemble a revolutionary history major course and would become a political mobilization report; second, he was afraid of giving the students less knowledge; third, he was afraid of disrupting the theoretical system. These concerns were resolved in the process of doing and changing. For example, some students said, "Participating in the current rectification movement and listening to such a class has made me understand the 1942 Rectification Movement more deeply." The result of this way of lecturing has freed teachers from the narrow concept of "history" and historical materials, and more closely combined it with the current reality, using reality to teach theory, and using theory to study reality, further improving the teaching quality of political theory courses.

### 从书堆里解放出来了  天津师范学院政治理论课结合当前政治运动

    从书堆里解放出来了
    天津师范学院政治理论课结合当前政治运动
    本报讯　记者朱泽民报道：天津师范学院政治教育系教师解放了思想，找到了使政治理论课教学同当前政治运动和学生思想实际密切结合、为当前政治运动服务的道路，使政治理论课变成了活的马列主义教材，既有了系统性和科学性，也有了战斗性和现实性。
    这个改革是政治教育系主任左建在讲授“中国现代革命史”中首先开始的。今年3月份，正当双反运动在学校里转入了以思想改造为中心阶段的时候，“中国现代革命史”课程也开始讲“1942年整风运动”。左建在备课的时候，就感觉到这一讲必须同当前的整风运动结合起来。但是怎样结合？开始时只注意了方法上的改变。例如，过去上课都是教师讲，学生听，很少结合当前问题进行讨论，这次他在讲完第一讲“1942年整风性质和经过”以后，就指定了文件让学生自学，提出六个思考题目在学生中开展辩论，并且结合检查自己的思想。这种在方法上的改变受到了学生的欢迎，但是他们认为：1942年整风主要是整主观主义、宗派主义、党八股，而学生当前存在的主要问题是个人主义，在思想检查中他们感到课程讲授同思想实际联不起来。因此左建感到仅仅是方法上的改变不够，还必须在内容上进行改革。左建就开始深入到学生中去，从书堆里把自己解放出来，参加学生的党团会、讨论会，到宿舍去和学生谈天，根据学生的思想和要求修改了原来的教学计划。在第二讲讲“整风的意义、目的和方针”时，就针对学生的模糊认识和思想顾虑进行讲解，使得这一课又是“1942年整风运动”课的第二讲，又是一个思想检查的动员报告，使学生们感到很切合自己的思想实际，过了一、两天，全系学生都贴了大字报检查自己的思想。但是在学生检查思想过程中，又发现了新的问题：有的人暴露思想比较彻底、有的人丢了旧包袱又背了新包袱、有的人打开了包袱还没有放下、有的人还不敢暴露思想。这说明学生对待自己的错误还缺乏正确的认识，于是针对这种思想情况又讲了第三讲：“整风态度问题”。这一讲非常受学生欢迎，大家都觉得及时解决了自己的思想问题，有的说：“过去听革命史课自己没有思想斗争，这次一边听课一边自己思想里就展开了斗争。”有的说：“这样讲课不但解决了思想问题，还懂得了理论教学如何联系思想实际。”更普遍的反映是：“过去总把革命史当成历史课听，这次讲课才像个政治课。”
    左建在谈到这次改革时认为对自己也是一次整风，整掉了政治理论教员脱离当前政治运动、脱离思想实际的风。过去他在讲授革命史的时候，对于政治理论课结合实际、为政治运动服务的看法就是在讲稿中增加一些新的例子，能联系实际就联系，不能联系就照原来的讲稿讲。在这次改革中，他也有过顾虑，第一怕这样讲课不像个革命史专业课，成了政治动员报告；第二怕少给了学生知识；第三怕打乱了理论系统。这些顾虑在边干边改中都得到了解决。例如，有的学生说：“参加了当前的整风运动，又听了这样的课，才使我比较深刻地理解了1942年的整风运动。”这样讲课的结果，使教师从“史”的狭隘概念和历史资料中解放出来，而更多地结合当前的实际，用现实去讲授理论，又运用理论来研究现实，进一步提高了政治理论课的教学质量。
