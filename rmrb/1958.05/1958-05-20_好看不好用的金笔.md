　　Good-Looking But Unusable Gold Pens
　　The three of us each bought a Longines gold pen. These pens look very nice, but they have many problems when used. First, the ink flow is poor, making writing awkward; second, the quality of the nib is not high, and after writing for only a few days, the nib becomes too thick to use; third, after using it for only a few days, the pen barrel cracks. Taking the poor quality of the nib as an example, a new pen became unusable in less than a month, so it was sent to Shanghai to be replaced. After being replaced, the nib became unusable again in less than three months. Helpless, we had to have some iridium tipped at a repair shop. After that, the ink flow was still not smooth, and the pen barrel cracked again. Now it is almost "disabled." We hope that the mainland pen factory producing Longines pens will pay attention to improving the quality of their products.

　　好看不好用的金笔
    我们三个人各买了一枝浪琴牌金笔，这种笔样子很好看，可是使用起来毛病却很多。一是下水不畅，写起来很别扭；一是笔尖的质量不高，写了不多几天，笔尖就粗得不能用了；一是用了不几天，笔杆裂缝了。拿笔尖质量差这一点来说吧，一枝新笔用了不到一个月就不行了，于是就寄到上海去换，换回来以后不到三个月，笔尖又不能用了。无奈只得在修理店里点了点铱金。此后又是下水不流畅，笔杆又裂了口子。现在几乎成了“残废”。希望生产浪琴牌的大陆笔厂要注意提高产品的质量。李儒谦　梁宗尧  田德雨
