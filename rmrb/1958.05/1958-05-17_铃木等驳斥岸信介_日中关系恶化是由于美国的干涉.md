Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: Suzuki Kazuo Saburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, said on the 14th that the rapid deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations is the result of the United States' cunning interference in Japan's internal affairs. He pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government's implementation of policies that undermine Sino-Japanese relations is to succumb to the will of the United States.

　　Suzuki made these remarks at a press conference held in Osaka on his way to the Kinki region for election campaign activities.

　　Suzuki said that China is safeguarding its legitimate international status with firm determination. He said that the view that China's recent actions are an attempt to influence the Japanese general election is wrong.

　　Suzuki said that the Japanese government should make a major determination to negotiate with the Chinese government on the normalization of relations between the two countries. The ongoing election campaign cannot be used as an excuse for the Kishi Nobusuke government not to negotiate with China.

　　Asanuma Inejirō, Secretary-General of the Japan Socialist Party, said in Taira City, Fukushima Prefecture, on the 12th that the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations is the result of the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet pursuing a foreign policy that follows the United States. The government should quickly retract the statements made by Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi regarding non-recognition of China and support for Chiang Kai-shek's group in Taiwan.

　　He demanded that the government enable the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to be implemented as soon as possible.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th: The Japan-China Trade Promotion Association passed a resolution at its board meeting on the 15th, demanding that the Japanese government resolve the Sino-Japanese trade issue as soon as possible.

　　The resolution pointed out that the Japanese government's failure to face the international situation squarely and its failure to guarantee Sino-Japanese trade have resulted in a complete standstill in Sino-Japanese trade. This situation not only causes losses to relevant Japanese manufacturers but will also bring significant impacts on the Japanese economy, and the future of Japan's foreign trade will be bleak.

　　Suzuki Kazuo, Executive Director of the Association, pointed out in his speech at the meeting that the root cause of the complete standstill of Sino-Japanese trade is the erroneous basic policy of Japanese diplomacy. Therefore, it is necessary to launch a long-term movement backed by the power of the people to demand that the Japanese government change its policies in order to resolve the current situation in Sino-Japanese trade.

　　The meeting also decided that the Association will set up a committee to implement the resolution and actively participate in the "National Assembly to Open Up the Strained Situation in Sino-Japanese Relations" which has been postponed to the 20th in Tokyo.

　　铃木等驳斥岸信介
　　日中关系恶化是由于美国的干涉
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本社会党委员长铃木一雄三郎14日说，日中关系的迅速恶化是美国狡猾地干涉日本内政的结果。他指出，岸信介政府执行破坏日中关系的政策是为了屈从美国的意志。
    铃木在去近畿地方进行竞选活动的路上到达大阪时举行的记者招待会上发表了这番谈话。
    铃木说，中国是在以坚定的决心维护它在国际上合法的地位。他说，认为中国最近的行动是企图影响日本大选这种观点是错误的。
    铃木说，日本政府应该下大决心同中国政府谈判两国关系正常化的问题。不能以目前正在进行竞选活动作为岸信介政府不同中国进行谈判的借口。
    日本社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎12日在福岛县平市说，日中关系的恶化是岸信介内阁执行追随美国的外交政策的结果，政府应该迅速地收回首相岸信介和官房长官爱知揆一发表的关于不承认中国、支持台湾蒋介石集团的谈话。
    他要求政府使第四次日中贸易协定能够早日实施。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日中贸易促进协会在15日举行的理事会会议上通过决议，要求日本政府尽速解决日中贸易问题。
    决议指出，由于日本政府不正视国际形势，对日中贸易不给予保证，因而造成日中贸易的全面停顿。这种情况不仅使日本的有关厂商受到损失，还将为日本经济带来重大的影响，日本对外贸易的前途将是黑暗的。
    协会的专务理事铃木一雄在会上讲话时指出，招致日中贸易全面停顿的根源是错误的日本外交基本政策。因此必须以人民的力量为后盾，展开要求日本政府改变政策的长期运动，才能解决日中贸易目前存在的局面。
    会议还决定，协会将设置一个执行决议的委员会，并且积极参加已经延期到20日在东京举行的“打开日中关系紧张局面国民大会”。
