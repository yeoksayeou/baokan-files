    Protecting Trees Along Railway Lines
    I recently returned to Beijing from Shanghai. On the train, along the Jinpu Railway line, especially in the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas, I saw that some farmers, in order to pick locust flowers and leaves to feed their sheep, were stripping the leaves from some of the trees used for greening the railway line. Some branches were completely broken off, leaving only a bare tree trunk; some trees were even pulled down. It was infuriating and regrettable to see. I hope that the People's Committees and agricultural cooperatives at all levels along the railway line will regularly conduct propaganda and education among local farmers, teaching them to cherish the trees along the railway line and help the railway department to do a good job in greening the area.

    保护铁路沿线树木
    我最近从上海回北京，在火车上看到津浦铁路沿线，特别是蚌埠徐州一带，有些农民为了采摘槐花和树叶喂羊，竟把一些绿化铁路沿线的树木叶子掠光；有的树枝全被折掉，只剩下一根秃树干；甚至有的树还被拉倒，看来使人感到又气愤又可惜。希望沿铁路线的各级人民委员会和农业社，经常对当地农民进行宣传，教育他们爱护铁路沿线的树木，帮助铁路部门作好沿线的绿化工作。
