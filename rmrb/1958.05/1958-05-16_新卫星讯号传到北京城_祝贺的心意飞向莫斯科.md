Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: As of 22:25 (Beijing time) on May 15th, the Xinhua News Agency receiving station in Beijing had twice received telegraph signals from the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite, based on the 20.005 megacycle frequency announced by TASS. The first reception began at 20:40, with a strong signal that gradually weakened at 20:44 and disappeared at 20:48. The second reception began at 22:22, with a weaker signal that disappeared at 22:25. Both times, the signals received resembled the Morse code for "L".

Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: After the Central People's Broadcasting Station began broadcasting the news of the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite at 19:35 this afternoon, many listeners in the capital called the station to inquire about the details of the satellite and express their congratulations to the Soviet people. Wang Deshun, the foreman of the youth blast furnace at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, who was currently smelting iron, recorded the altitude, weight, and speed of the satellite he heard on the radio and conveyed the good news to the workers. Many workers jumped for joy.

Zhao Jiuzhang, Director of the Institute of Geophysics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, immediately wrote down his thoughts after hearing the news on the radio and sent them to the newspaper. He wrote: "The Soviet Union's third artificial satellite greatly surpasses the second artificial satellite in terms of payload, scientific instruments, types of scientific measurements, and operating devices. This shows that Soviet modern science and technology have reached such a point that almost anything humans want to do can be done; the question is who masters the technology. We want to express our heartfelt congratulations to the Soviet Union on yet another great achievement."

After the broadcasting station at Qianmen Railway Station received the news of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite going into space, announcer Liu Wenqi immediately broadcast the news to the five waiting rooms of the station. Passengers gathered in small groups to excitedly discuss the good news. Every train departing from Beijing tonight will also broadcast this inspiring good news on board.

　　新卫星讯号传到北京城  祝贺的心意飞向莫斯科
    新华社15日讯　到15日下午二十二点二十五分（北京时间），北京新华社收讯台已经两次根据塔斯社公布的二○·○○五兆周的频率，收听到了苏联第三个人造地球卫星发射的电报讯号。第一次开始收听到的时间是二十点四十分，讯号较强，到二十点四十四分渐弱，到二十点四十八分讯号消失。第二次开始收听到的时间是二十二点二十二分，讯号较弱，到二十二点二十五分讯号消失。两次收听到的讯号都类似摩尔斯电码的“L”。新华社15日讯　在中央人民广播电台下午十九点三十五分开始广播苏联发射成功第三个人造地球卫星的消息以后，首都很多听众给电台打电话，询问这个人造卫星的详细情况，并表示对苏联人民的祝贺。正在炼铁的石景山钢铁厂青年高炉的工长王德顺，把从广播中听到的这个人造卫星的高度、重量、速度都记录下来，向工人们传达了这个喜讯。许多工人都高兴得跳起来。
    中国科学院地球物理研究所所长赵九章从收音机里听到这个消息后，立即提笔写下了自己的感想，送给报社。他写道：“苏联第三个人造卫星无论在载重、科学仪器、科学测量种类、运转装置等方面都大大超过了第二个人造卫星。这说明苏联现代科学技术已经达到这样一个地步：人类要作的事几乎都可以作，问题是谁掌握技术。我们要为苏联又一次的伟大成就表示衷心的祝贺。”
    前门车站广播台得到苏联第三个人造卫星上天的消息后，播音员刘文祺立即向车站的五个候车室播送了这个消息，旅客们三五成群在一起兴奋地谈论着这个好消息。今晚从北京发出的每一列火车，也将在列车内播送这一振奋人心的喜讯。
