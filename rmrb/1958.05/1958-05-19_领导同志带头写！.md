Leading Comrades Take the Lead in Writing!
　　Yi Ding
    A person with a communist style dares to think, dares to speak, dares to act, and also dares to write.
    Write about the people of our great era, write about the experiences of revolution and construction, write about everything we feel we must write and that is needed by the people.
    Professional writers should write, amateur writers should write, all laborers should write, all comrades in revolutionary work posts should write. Let us launch a large-scale mass writing movement to depict the colors and sounds of our great era. This, like any mass movement, requires leading comrades at all levels to take the lead!
    Treat "writing" as one of the contents of leadership work, as one of the learning tasks, as one of the methods of carrying out political and ideological work, as one of the ways to connect with the masses, as one of the weapons to fight against modern revisionism, and as an integral part of one's political and cultural life. All of this is what the people demand of their leaders.
    Many of our leading comrades have moving experiences, rich experiences, and genuine insights into the laws of development of things, and are sensitive to new things... All of this can be written, and should be written. Unfortunately, some comrades are unwilling to write, and some comrades write too little. Why? It is said that there are many reasons.
    "No time" is one reason. It is a fact that leading comrades are very busy. Is it so busy that there is no time to write? No. If writing is regarded as an extra burden, as an unimportant matter, of course, one is unwilling or reluctant to "waste" time on it. If writing is regarded as a political task, then there is plenty of time. Time depends on how people arrange it, and time must be squeezed out to write.
      "Squeezing out time to write" is a sense of political responsibility, a manifestation of love for life, and also a leadership art. I know a first secretary of a provincial party committee who is good at squeezing out time to write. He writes essays, writes poems, writes prefaces, writes treatises, and even wrote ditties about leadership methods. In addition to writing himself, he also encourages his subordinates to write. He personally leads a writing group. He often helps other comrades revise articles. He often talks with comrades about how to write better, more, and more timely. The essays written by the writing group he led have had a great impact in the province where he works. A first secretary of a municipal party committee told me that he once wrote for sixteen consecutive hours on a Sunday to rush two short articles for two magazines. Are these two first secretaries not busy? Why do they have time to write? It seems that this question involves the issue of working methods.
    How should a leading comrade work? Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin are our role models, and Comrade Mao Zedong is our role model. Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin left us with a large number of classic works. Our great leader Comrade Mao Zedong wrote many classic works and many of the most magnificent and moving poems during the tense years of revolutionary war and in extremely heavy leadership work. How did they arrange their writing time? When we are faced with the classic works of these great classic writers, are we still embarrassed to use the excuse of "no time" not to learn to write?
    "Cannot write well" is another reason. The more one cannot write well, the more one should write, and the better one will write, this is one situation. The more one cannot write well, the more unwilling one is to write, and the worse one writes, this is another situation. Many of our leading comrades have learned to fight wars, have learned to build, and many comrades who were originally illiterate have learned to write poetry and write novels. In the past, they took pride in being "roughnecks," but now they take pride in being "good at learning and thinking deeply, both red and expert." Is there anything wrong with this change? If one can write but is always afraid of "not writing well" and does not put pen to paper, it is an unnecessary "excessive modesty."
    "Afraid of making mistakes" is also a reason. If a person has ideological problems, or if their ideology is unhealthy, or if their thinking methods are not correct, then writing will certainly lead to mistakes. Not writing will also lead to mistakes. Writing is like doing work. As long as the direction is right, making small mistakes is unavoidable and not terrible. We must never not do work or not write because we are afraid of making mistakes, just as we cannot not walk because we are afraid of falling. Not daring to think, not daring to speak, not daring to do, not daring to write is the most terrible mistake. Daring to think, daring to speak, daring to do, daring to write, correcting mistakes if they are made, what is there to be afraid of?
    Leading comrades, we ask you to personally write, organize others to write, encourage others to write, help others to write, carry forward the communist spirit, and write more and better works that are worthy of our great era!

### 领导同志带头写！

　　领导同志带头写！
　　一丁
    具有共产主义风格的人，敢想、敢说、敢做，还要敢写。
    把我们这个伟大时代的人写出来，把革命和建设的经验写出来，把我们自己感觉到非写不可，而又为人民所需要的一切东西写出来。
    专业作家要写，业余作家要写，一切劳动者要写，一切革命工作岗位上的同志都要写，开展一个大规模的群众写作运动，描绘我们这个伟大时代的色彩和声音，这也像开展任何群众运动一样，需要各级领导同志带头干！
    把“写”，当作领导工作的内容之一，当作学习任务之一，当作进行政治思想工作的方法之一，当作联系群众的方式之一，当作同现代修正主义作斗争的武器之一，当作自己的政治生活和文化生活的一个组成部分。这一切，都是人民对于自己的领导者的要求。
    我们许多领导同志，有着动人的经历，丰富的经验和对于事物发展规律的真知灼见、对于新事物的敏感，……这一切，都可以写，也应当写，可惜的是，有的同志不愿写，有的同志，写得太少了。为什么呢？据说有许多理由。
    “没有时间”，这是一个理由。领导同志很忙，这是事实。是不是忙的连写的时间也没有？不是的。如果把写当作一种额外负担，当作无关重要的事情，当然不愿意或者舍不得在这上头“浪费”时间。如果把写当作一种政治任务，那末，有的是时间。时间在于人的安排，要挤出时间来写。
      “挤时间写”，这是一种政治责任感，是热爱生活的表现，也是一种领导艺术。我认识一位省委第一书记，他善于挤时间写，他写杂文，写诗，写序言，写专论，还写过关于领导方法的顺口溜。除了自己动手写之外，他还鼓励下面的同志写，他亲自领导一个写作小组，他常常帮助别的同志改文章，他常常和同志们交谈如何写得更好些，更多些，更及时些。他所领导的写作小组所写的杂文，在他工作的那个省有很大的影响。一位市委第一书记告诉我，他曾经在一个星期天，连续写了十六个钟头，为两个杂志赶写了两篇短文。难道这两位第一书记不忙吗？为什么他们有时间写呢？看来，这个问题牵涉到工作方法问题上了。
    一个领导同志应当怎样去工作？马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林是我们的典范，毛泽东同志是我们的典范。马、恩、列、斯给我们留下了大量的经典著作。我们的伟大领袖毛泽东同志在紧张的革命战争年代，在极端繁重的领导工作中，写出了许多经典著作，还写出了许多最雄伟、最动人的诗篇。他们又是怎样安排写的时间呢？当我们面对着这些伟大的经典作家的经典著作的时候，我们还好意思借口“没有时间”而不学习写作吗？
    “写不好”，这又是一个理由。越是写不好，越要写，越写越好，这是一种情况。越是写不好，越不愿意写，越写不好，这又是一种情况。我们许多领导同志，学会了打仗，学会了建设，许多原来是文盲的同志，学会了写诗歌，写小说，过去以“大老粗”为荣，现在以“好学深思，又红又专”为荣。这种变化，有什么不好呢？如果自己本来能写，却老是怕“写不好”而不动笔，更是一种不必要的“过分的谦虚”。
    “怕犯错误”，这也是一种理由。一个人，如果是思想有毛病，或者是思想意识不健康，或者是思想方法不对头，写东西当然要犯错误，不写东西，也是要犯错误。写东西和做工作一样，只要是方向对头，犯点小错误，在所难免，也不可怕。我们决不能因为怕犯错误而不做工作，不写东西，正像不能因为怕摔跤而不走路一样。不敢想，不敢说，不敢做，不敢写，这是一种最可怕的错误。敢想、敢说、敢做、敢写，错了就改，有什么可怕之处呢？
    领导同志们，要求你们亲自动手写，组织别人写，鼓励别人写，帮助别人写，发扬共产主义精神，写出更多的、更好的，无愧于我们这个伟大时代的作品！
