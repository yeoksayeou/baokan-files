    It is necessary to advocate collaboration
  　Xiao Ming
    Recently, a new atmosphere of large-scale collaboration has emerged between institutions of higher learning, secondary vocational schools, scientific research institutions, and factory and mining enterprises.
    In the collaborative activities of many units, the communist spirit of "one for all, all for one" has been promoted. Ten higher education institutions in Shenyang actively collaborated extensively with factories, enterprises, agriculture, finance and economics, culture and education, health and other departments. The Shenyang Medical College, despite having heavy teaching tasks, also allocated manpower to support the Shenyang Municipal Hospital and actively supported the establishment of a county hospital. Scientists, professors, and engineers in Tianjin collaborated with relevant industrial departments. In this collaboration, some professors voluntarily abandoned some of their original scientific research work and devoted themselves to research work more urgently needed for socialist construction and closely related to production, which is a very good thing. This kind of collaboration, as Marx said, is the beginning of communism.
    Engels said: "If we carefully examine nature, human history, or our own mental activities, we first see an infinitely complex picture of connections and interactions, in which nothing remains what, where, and as it was, but everything moves, changes, comes into being, and passes away." Precisely because things are "an infinitely complex picture of connections and interactions," we must also collaborate with each other, interact, and support each other in our work in order to conform to the laws of the advancement of objective things and carry out construction in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    The making of a car requires both an inventor and a manufacturer; at the same time, it is the sum of collaboration in many aspects such as steel, rubber, machinery, and instruments. The same is true of everything else. The better the combination of mental and physical labor, and the better the combination of various business aspects, the faster the progress and the greater the achievements of the construction undertaking. Conversely, the progress of the construction undertaking will be slower and the achievements will be smaller.
    In the past, bourgeois intellectuals both despised production practice and loved to work independently. Because under the old social system, there were only the personal interests of the exploiters and the interests of a small sect, but no collective interests of the people; therefore, people forcibly separated the closely linked, interactive, and infinitely complex overall undertaking, kept secrets from each other, resulting in duplication and waste in the construction undertaking, and causing serious loss of strength. Today, we have overthrown the old and backward social system and established a progressive socialist system. In the collective interests of the people, each of us has a share, which will promote people to establish the idea of collaboration. The problem is that society has progressed, but some people have not yet realized this, and their thinking is still lagging behind reality.
    To collaborate, we must first pay attention to solving people's ideological problems. Wherever bourgeois individualism thrives, it is difficult for genuine mutual assistance and collaboration to emerge. Only by thoroughly criticizing individualistic thinking can we carry out collaboration collectively and in an organized manner. The large-scale collaboration of scientific and technological workers in Tianjin, for example, began after many professors and scientists criticized their personal fame and gain thinking, selfishness, and the ideological style of only wanting to work independently, thus establishing a common ideological foundation.
    At the same time, participating in collaboration is a good way to connect with reality and transform thinking, which can help people improve their professional level and the quality of teaching and scientific research work, and guide people to the great cause of socialist construction, establishing the feelings of socialist laborers and a sense of overall perspective. This kind of collaboration will promote the growth and development of communist thought. We must advocate collaboration, because the better the collaboration, the faster we will advance.

### 要提倡协作

    要提倡协作
  　萧明
    最近，高等学校、中等专业学校、科学研究机关和厂矿企业部门之间，出现了大协作的新气象。
    在许多单位的协作活动中，都发扬了“我为人人，人人为我”的共产主义精神。沈阳十所高等院校等积极和工厂、企业、农业、财经、文教、卫生等部门进行广泛协作。沈阳医学院在教学任务很重的情况下，还抽出人力支援了沈阳市立医院，并积极支援一所县立医院的创办。天津市科学家、教授、工程师和各有关工业部门协作，在协作中有些教授主动地放弃了自己原来的一些科学研究工作，投入到对社会主义建设更迫切需要的一些与生产密切结合的研究工作中去，这是很好的好事。这种协作正如马克思说的，是共产主义的开端。
    恩格斯说：“如果我们留意地考察自然，人类历史或我们自己的精神活动，那末我们首先见到种种联系及交互作用之无限错综的图画，在这中间，没有任何东西，保持原来的性质、场所及状态，万物皆动皆变、皆生皆灭。”正因为事物是“种种联系及交互作用之无限错综的图画”，因此在我们的工作中也必须互相协作，交互作用，互相支援，才符合于客观事物的前进的规律，才能多快好省地进行建设。
    一辆汽车的制成，既要有发明者，又要有制造者；同时又是钢铁、橡胶、机械、仪表……等许多方面协作的总合。其他任何事物，也都是这样的。脑力劳动体力劳动结合得越好，各个不同业务方面结合得越好，建设事业的进步也就越快，成就也就越大。反之，建设事业就进步得慢，成就也就小。
    过去，资产阶级知识分子既轻视生产实际，还爱好单干。因为在旧的社会制度下，只有剥削者的个人利益和一个小宗派的利益，而没有人民的集体的利益；因此，人们把密切联系着的交互作用无限错综的整体事业硬生生地割裂开来，互相保密，造成建设事业中的重复浪费，造成力量的严重耗损。今天，我们已经推翻了旧的落后的社会制度，建立了进步的社会主义制度，在人民的集体利益中，都有我们每个人的一份，这就会促使人们树立起协作的思想。问题在于社会前进了，而有些人还没有认识到这一点，他们的思想还落后于实际。
    要协作，就首先要注意解决人们的思想问题。凡是资产阶级个人主义思想滋长的地方，就很难出现真正的互助协作。只有彻底地批判了个人主义思想，才能集体地有组织地进行协作。像天津科学技术工作者的大协作，就是首先在许多教授、科学家批判了自己的个人名利思想，自私自利，以及只愿单干等思想作风以后，有了共同的思想基础，才开展起来的。
    同时，参加协作是一种很好地联系实际改造思想的办法，可以帮助人们提高业务水平和教学、科学研究工作的质量，并把人们引导到伟大的社会主义建设事业中去，树立社会主义的劳动者的感情和整体观念。这种协作，将促使共产主义思想的成长和发展。我们要提倡协作，因为协作得越好，就会使我们前进得越快。
