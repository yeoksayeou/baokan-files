Xinhua News Agency, May 4th, Berlin (TASS dispatch): The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic issued a statement regarding the upcoming meeting of foreign ministers of NATO member states in Copenhagen.

The statement emphasized that the West German ruling circles are trying to eliminate all existing restrictions on the West German armed forces in terms of armaments and to strengthen their influence in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. To this end, the West German representatives supported the US proposal made at the NATO Defense Ministers' meeting in April to arm the group's forces with atomic weapons.

The statement continued that since the NATO meeting opening in Copenhagen on May 5 will re-examine the issue of atomic armament of the group's member states, the West German ruling circles hastily pushed the reactionary majority of the West German Bundestag to pass a resolution on West German atomic armament. This policy of the West German ruling circles runs counter to the demands of the majority of West German residents, who firmly demand a halt to the atomic arms race, advocate the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones, and the gradual easing of current international tensions.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic pointed out that the Norwegian Foreign Ministry's fabrication of rumors about the deployment of Soviet rockets on the territory of the German Democratic Republic, Poland, and Czechoslovakia can only be regarded as an attempt to divert the attention of the people of all countries from the real breeding ground of danger in Europe, thereby plotting to drag the armed forces of the Scandinavian countries into the atomic war policy of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

The statement concluded that as the NATO Copenhagen Conference is about to be held, the people of all countries are closely watching the efforts being made to find a solution as soon as possible to the most pressing international disputes, including the cessation of the atomic arms race, at a high-level meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 5th: Bonn News: The Executive Committee of the West German Social Democratic Party sent a telegram from West Berlin on the 4th to the NATO foreign ministers meeting which began in Copenhagen on the 5th, calling for no equipping of the West German army with atomic weapons.

The telegram pointed out that the West German Social Democratic Party, representing more than nine million voters, is convinced that its firm opposition to equipping the West German army with atomic weapons is supported by the vast majority of the people. The telegram demanded that serious negotiations begin on the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

The telegram also pointed out that the suspension of nuclear weapons testing within a prescribed period would help to ease international tensions.

    民主德国外交部发表声明
    哥本哈根会议策划原子备战
    西德社会民主党致电会议反对西德原子武装
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社柏林4日讯：德意志民主共和国外交部为将在哥本哈根举行的北大西洋集团成员国外交部长会议发表声明。
    声明强调指出，西德统治集团力图消除西德武装力量在军备方面的一切现有的限制，并加强他们在北大西洋集团中的影响。西德代表本着这个目的，支持美国在今年4月北大西洋集团国防部长会议上提出的主张用原子武器武装这个集团的军队的要求。
    声明接着说，由于5月5日在哥本哈根开幕的这次北大西洋集团会议将重新研究这个集团的成员国原子武装的问题，西德统治集团及早匆匆忙忙促使西德联邦议院反动多数通过了关于西德原子武装的决议。西德统治集团的这种政策是违背西德大多数居民的要求的，他们坚决要求停止原子军备竞赛，主张建立无原子武器地区和逐步缓和当前的国际紧张局势。
    德意志民主共和国外交部指出，挪威外交部捏造关于在德意志民主共和国、波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的领土上设置苏联火箭的谣言，这只能被认为是企图转移各国人民对欧洲真正的危险策源地的注意，从而策划把斯堪的纳维亚国家的武装力量拖入北大西洋集团的原子战争政策中。
    声明最后说，在北大西洋集团哥本哈根会议将要召开的时候，各国人民正在密切注视着为了在高级会议上使最迫切的国际争执问题（其中包括停止原子军备竞赛的问题）尽快求得解决而作的努力。
    新华社柏林5日电　波恩消息：西德社会民主党执行委员会4日从西柏林打电报给5日开始在哥本哈根举行的北大西洋公约组织外交部长会议，呼吁不要给西德军队装备原子武器。
    电报指出，代表九百多万选民的西德社会民主党确信它坚决反对以原子武器装备西德军队的立场是受到绝大多数人民的支持的。电报要求就建立中欧无原子武器区问题开始进行认真的谈判。
    电报还指出：在规定的期限内停止核武器试验是有助于国际紧张局势的缓和的。
