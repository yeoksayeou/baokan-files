    Starting with Two Small Things
    Shí Yītiáo
    Let's start with a small thing I saw:
    In the Liuyang County Party Committee office, an agricultural technician from Changsha requested someone to take him to see the "ma jun" mushrooms produced by the masses. Secretary Shi Weigang, who had just come out of the rice fields, said: I'll take you. He immediately walked barefoot on the small path covered with gravel. Comrade Shi Weigang is from Shanxi and originally didn't walk barefoot, but after coming to Hunan, he learned the skill of walking barefoot. He said: Not only can he do this, but many cadres from the north can do this. Hunan's countryside is full of paddy fields, and cadres wearing shoes and socks can neither directly lead production nor easily approach the masses at any time or place. Therefore, cadres who often work in the countryside have all become "barefoot immortals."
    Now let's talk about a small thing I heard:
    There was a young cadre in the Liuyang County Party Committee who cherished his long hair very much. This year, during the Great Leap Forward in production, many comrades consciously shaved their long hair, put on peasant clothes, and went deep into the masses. Under the influence of this atmosphere, this comrade was also prepared to "sacrifice" his hair. However, he was reluctant to shave it off completely all at once. So, for the first time, he asked the barber to cut his long hair a little shorter. After the cut, he felt it was still a bit too long. So, for the second time, he had it cut even shorter. After the cut, he felt it still wasn't thorough enough, and he made up his mind to shave it completely bald for the third time. For the sake of his hair, he went through such a tortuous ideological struggle, and finally, the struggle was victorious. This comrade, like other cadres, truly went deep into the masses.
    Liuyang County cadres learning to walk barefoot is a small matter. However, looking at this fact, it embodies the issue of integrating with the masses from thought to action. This concrete example shows that as long as you truly appear as an ordinary worker and strictly demand yourself, then tangible obstacles like shoes and socks can be removed, and intangible obstacles in thought can also be removed. Removing the old will allow new things to grow. If this is truly achieved, the problem of connecting with the masses will naturally be easier to solve.
    A young cadre in Liuyang made up his mind three times before finally shaving off his long hair, which is an even smaller matter. However, in such a small matter, one can see the immense power of social atmosphere. Currently, there is a prevailing atmosphere among the broad masses of cadres of comparing drive, comparing diligence, and comparing going deep into the masses. Under this atmosphere, some people are naturally influenced by it. This influence sometimes conflicts with a person's hobbies, thoughts, and even living habits. However, after the conflict, a person willing to progress always changes himself to adapt to the new social atmosphere, and many cadres have changed in this way.
    Whether it is a conscious change or a change after being influenced, the masses welcome it. Due to the transformation of the cadres' work style, the masses in Hunan now have these sentences to describe cadres: "From a distance, they don't look like cadres; up close, they don't look like cadres; and when they speak, they don't sound like cadres." These sentences fully express the state of cadres becoming one with the masses and are the masses' greatest praise for the cadres.

    从两件小事说起
    石一迢
    先说看来的一件小事：
    在浏阳县委办公室里，从长沙来的一位农业技师要求派人带他看看群众生产的麻菌。才从稻田里跳出来的石维刚书记说：我带你去，马上赤着双脚走上了遍布碎石的小路。石维刚同志是山西人，本来是不会赤脚走路的，来到湖南，他学会了赤脚走路的本领。他说：不仅他能这样，许多北方来的干部都能这样。湖南农村遍地是水田，干部穿着鞋袜，既不能直接领导生产，又妨碍随时随地接近群众。因此，经常在农村工作的干部，一个个都变成了“赤脚大仙”。
    再说听来的一件小事：
    浏阳县委会有一个青年干部，非常爱护自己留的长头发。今年，在生产大跃进中，许多同志都自觉地剃掉长头发，穿起农民装，深入到群众中去。在这种风气的感染下，这位同志也准备“牺牲”自己的头发了。但是，骤然完全剃掉，一时还舍不得。于是，第一次先让理发师将自己的长发剪短一些。剪完看看，还有点太长。于是，第二次又让剪得更短一些。剪完了再看，还不彻底，一下决心，第三次完全剃成了光头。为了一头头发，经过这样曲折地思想斗争，最后斗争胜利了，这位同志和其他干部一样真正地深入到群众中去。
    浏阳县的干部学会赤脚走路，这是件小事。可是，透过这个事实来看，它却体现了一个从思想上到行动上与群众打成一片的问题。这个具体的事例说明，只要真正以普通劳动者姿态出现，严格的要求自己，那么，鞋袜之类的有形障碍可以去掉，思想上的无形的障碍也可以去掉。去掉旧的东西，就会生长新的东西。真正做到这样，联系群众的问题自然比较容易解决了。
    浏阳的一位青年干部三下决心，最后才剃掉了一头长发，这更是一件小事。可是，在这样的小事中，可以看出社会风气具有如何巨大的力量。现在，在广大干部中流行着比干劲、比钻劲、比深入群众的风气。在这种风气下，有些人自然地受了这方面的感染。这种感染，有时候会和一个人的爱好、思想以至生活习惯发生冲突。但是，冲突之后，一个愿意进步的人，总是改变自己，以适应新的社会风气，许多的干部就是这样改变过来。
    不管是自觉改变，还是受了感染以后改变，群众都是欢迎的。由于干部作风的转变，现在湖南群众有这样几句话形容干部，“远看不像干部，近看不像干部，说话不像干部”。这几句话充分说出干部群众化的状况，是群众对干部的最大的赞誉。
