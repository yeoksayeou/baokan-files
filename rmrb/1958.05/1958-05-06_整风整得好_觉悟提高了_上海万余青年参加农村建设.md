Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 5th: Over twelve thousand educated young people in Shanghai have volunteered to participate in rural construction in Hubei and Anhui. On the 4th, over five hundred people going to Hubei and seven hundred people going to Anhui have already set sail by boat. The remaining ten thousand plus people will also leave Shanghai in the next few days successively. Prior to this, over nine thousand educated young people from Shanghai had already volunteered to go to Anhui and Fengxian, Jiangsu, to participate in agricultural construction and the construction of seawalls.

The year-long rectification movement and the rapid leap forward in industrial and agricultural production have greatly changed the views of many educated young people in Shanghai and their parents on agricultural labor. Many educated young people who originally thought there was no future in going to the countryside, were afraid of hardship, and were reluctant to leave Shanghai, have now become active participants volunteering for agricultural construction due to increased awareness. According to statistics from the Xinle Road Office of the Xuhui District People's Committee, when rural areas in Anhui and other places first recruited educated young people in Shanghai at the end of last year, only more than seventy people from the area under this office signed up, accounting for about 25% of the total number of educated young people at that time. This time, more than one hundred and seventy people signed up, accounting for more than 80% of the existing educated young people. Yao Dagang, a high school graduate from the Yulin District, failed to get into university last year. For several months, he got up early and went to bed late to review his lessons, vowing to "march into the Physics Department of Peking University, and never stop until I get into university." Recently, after the rectification movement, he recognized the bright future of China's agricultural development and decided to settle in the countryside for a long time. He has now been approved to go to Anhui. Old Mama Huang Yundi from the Yimiao District doted on her daughter. She did not let her daughter go when social youth went to the mountains and countryside in the previous few times. This time, at 3:30 in the morning on the first day of registration, she went with her daughter to sign up. She said: Supporting the countryside is supporting socialism, and holding back the children is holding back socialism. The rectification movement in the neighborhood also enlightened this old mama. Among the young people who volunteered to go to the countryside, many came from bourgeois families. They proposed "not to be flowers in a greenhouse, but to be pine and cypress in wind and frost."

    整风整得好　觉悟提高了
    上海万余青年参加农村建设
    据新华社上海5日电　上海一万二千个社会知识青年志愿参加湖北、安徽农村建设。4日，到湖北的五百多人和到安徽的七百人已分别乘轮出发。其余的一万多人也将在最近几天内陆续离开上海。在此以前，上海已经有九千多个社会知识青年志愿到安徽和江苏奉贤等地参加农业建设和兴修海塘。
    一年来的整风运动和工农业生产的飞速跃进，使上海许多知识青年和他们的家长对农业劳动的看法大为改变。许多原来认为到农村没有出息、怕吃苦、舍不得离开上海的知识青年，由于觉悟提高，这次都成了志愿参加农业建设的积极分子。据徐汇区人民委员会新乐路办事处统计，去年年底安徽等地农村第一次在上海招收知识青年时，这个办事处所属地区报名的只有七十多人，占当时社会知识青年总数的25％左右，这次报名的有一百七十多人，占现有社会知识青年的80％以上。榆林区高中毕业生姚大刚，去年没有考取大学，几个月来早起晚睡复习功课，发誓“向北大物理系进军，不进大学誓不休”。最近，经过整风运动，他认清了祖国农业发展的光辉远景，决心到农村长期落户。现在他已被批准到安徽去。邑庙区黄云娣老妈妈宠爱自己的女儿，前几次社会青年上山下乡时，都没有让她女儿去。这次在报名第一天的夜间三点半钟，她就和女儿一道去报名了。她说：支援农村就是支援社会主义，拖孩子的腿就是拖社会主义的腿。里弄的整风运动使这位老妈妈的思想也豁然开朗了。志愿到农村去的青年当中，有许多是出身于资产阶级家庭的，他们提出“不做温室里的花朵，要做风霜中的松柏”。（附图片）
