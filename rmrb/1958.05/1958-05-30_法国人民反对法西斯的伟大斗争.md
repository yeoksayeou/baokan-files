    The French people are engaged in an urgent struggle to defend democracy and peace. The mass actions against de Gaulle's usurpation of power are sweeping the country like a magnificent and surging tide. On May 27, workers across the country responded to the call of the French Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor, holding a massive anti-fascist general strike. On the 28th, under the leadership of the French Communist Party and other republican parties, Paris held another large-scale demonstration of 500,000 people. On the same day, mass anti-fascist demonstrations were also held in many other cities in France. This shows the determination of the French people to defend their freedom and democratic rights and to smash the conspiracy of fascist forces to establish a military dictatorship in France.
    Since the rebellion in Algeria, the French political situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse. On May 24, a military coup took place in Corsica, and fascist thugs controlled the provincial government. The fascist forces used this serious situation, which they had created, to blatantly demand that de Gaulle establish a military dictatorship. Pflimlin, a member of the Popular Republican Movement who had been indulging the fascist forces since taking office a few days earlier, secretly concluded a dirty deal with de Gaulle to hand over power behind the back of the National Assembly, and announced his resignation on the 28th; thus de Gaulle immediately rushed to Paris to prepare to take office. The French fascist forces also received the support of international reactionary forces. The United States has broken its silence and openly cheered for the French fascists. Eisenhower announced at a press conference on the 28th that he liked de Gaulle and talked a lot about his friendship with de Gaulle. According to the "Washington Post," the United States National Security Council even decided to use military intervention as a threat to prevent other French political parties from cooperating with the French Communist Party in the anti-fascist struggle.
    Dark clouds are pressing down on the city, and democracy and peace in France are in danger. However, this does not mean that the political future of France can be left to the mercy of the fascist forces. The current balance of political forces in France is favorable to the democratic forces and unfavorable to the fascist forces. The French Communist Party, which has great political influence, and the French working class and other working masses, who have democratic traditions and rich experience in struggle, are the strong pillars for defending democracy and peace. Precisely because the French people strongly oppose the fascist forces' usurpation of power, so among the French political parties, only the most right-wing conservative parties have announced their support for de Gaulle's taking office. The Popular Republican Movement, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, which participated in the Pflimlin government, although some of their upper-level leaders have openly or secretly approved of de Gaulle's taking office, are under intense pressure from the broad masses of party members and are in a state of violent division and struggle internally, and have not yet made a decision to support de Gaulle's taking office. Of particular note is the Socialist Party, which holds a pivotal position in Parliament. For a long time, the right-wing leaders of the French Socialist Party have refused to cooperate with the Communist Party, and even after the fascists launched a frenzied attack, they announced a "strict ban" on party members participating in the anti-fascist actions led by the Communist Party. However, the broad masses of grassroots members of the Socialist Party have become increasingly dissatisfied with this obstruction of working-class unity, and the pressure to take unified action with the French Communist Party has become increasingly strong. Precisely because of this, although the right-wing leader Mollet is still lobbying for de Gaulle, the vast majority of Socialists participated in the anti-fascist demonstration in Paris together with the Communists. Many members of the Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance, the Radical Party, and the Popular Republican Movement also participated in this demonstration. All this powerfully shows that although the fascist forces rely on the support of domestic right-wing groups and reactionary generals, and have received the encouragement of international reactionary forces, they can be rampant for a while, but the fate of France is ultimately determined by the French people, determined by the united struggle of the French people, and relying on this struggle, they will surely be able to dispel the fascist clouds that are shrouding France.
    Twenty-four years ago, in February 1934, the French fascist thugs forced the Radical Socialist government to resign, and what followed was an extreme right-wing government. The reactionary forces therefore shouted that they had won a "victory." But what was the result? The working class united, and millions of French people united, and their heroic struggle dealt a severe blow to the fascist forces. Today, the strength of the French people is much greater than it was more than twenty years ago. Not only that, but the current international situation is also very different from the past. More than twenty years ago, fascist forces were rising worldwide, and the vast majority of people around the world did not fully recognize the danger of fascism. Today, the people of the world, having been baptized by the anti-fascist Second World War, have deeply understood that fascism is a global disaster; the French people's anti-fascist struggle is an important part of the struggle of all progressive humanity to defend democracy, peace, and uphold national independence. Therefore, the peace-loving and democratic forces of the world condemn the conspiracies of the United States and all international reactionary forces to support the French fascist forces, and support the French people's struggle to defend democracy and peace.
    Of course, for the French people, the task of struggle is extremely arduous. However, we firmly believe that the French people who opened the Bastille prison will never allow the fascists to throw France into a new Bastille prison. The long-tested French Communist Party will surely be able to unite the French working class and working people, as well as all other democratic forces, to defeat the fascist offensive. Final victory will surely belong to the great French people!

### 法国人民反对法西斯的伟大斗争

    法国人民反对法西斯的伟大斗争
    法国人民正在为保卫民主和和平而进行着紧急的斗争。反对戴高乐篡夺政权的群众性的行动，正像壮阔澎湃的波涛一样席卷全国。5月27日，全国各地工人响应法国共产党和总工会的号召，举行了规模巨大的反法西斯总罢工。28日，在法国共产党和其它共和党派的领导下，巴黎又举行了有五十万人参加的声势浩大的示威游行。同一天，在法国其他许多城市，也举行了群众性的反法西斯示威。这显示了法国人民决心保卫自己的自由和民主权利，粉碎法西斯势力在法国建立军事独裁统治的阴谋。
    自从阿尔及利亚的叛乱发生以来，法国政局急转直下，5月24日，科西嘉又发生了军事政变，法西斯暴徒控制了省政府。法西斯势力利用它们一手造成的这个严重形势，明目张胆地要求由戴高乐建立军事独裁。在几天前上台以来就一直纵容法西斯势力的人民共和党人弗林姆兰，竟背着国民议会悄悄地和戴高乐谈妥了移交政权的肮脏交易，并于28日宣布辞职；这样戴高乐就马上赶到巴黎，准备登台执政。法国的法西斯势力还得到了国际反动势力的支持。美国已经打破缄默而公然为法国的法西斯分子打气。艾森豪威尔28日在记者招待会上宣布他喜欢戴高乐，并且大谈他和戴高乐的友谊。据“华盛顿邮报”透露，美国国家安全委员会甚至决定要用军事干涉作为威胁手段，来阻挠法国其它政党同法国共产党在反法西斯斗争中进行合作。
    黑云压城城欲摧，法国的民主、和平处在危急中。然而，这决不意味着法国的政治前途可以听任法西斯势力摆布了。目前法国的政治力量的对比是有利于民主势力而不利于法西斯势力的。具有巨大政治影响的法国共产党，具有民主传统和丰富斗争经验的法国工人阶级和其他劳动群众，是保卫民主、和平的坚强支柱。正因为法国人民强烈反对法西斯势力篡夺政权，所以在法国各政党中，迄今只有最右翼的几个保守党派宣布支持戴高乐上台，参加弗林姆兰政府的人民共和党、社会党、激进社会党、民主社会抵抗联盟，虽然它们的某些上层领袖都或明或暗地赞成戴高乐上台，但迫于广大党员群众的压力，内部正处于剧烈的分化和斗争中，都还没有作出支持戴高乐上台的决定。这中间特别值得注意的是社会党，这个党在议会中占有举足轻重的地位。长久以来，法国社会党右翼领袖一直拒绝和共产党合作，甚至当法西斯发动猖狂进攻以后还曾经宣布“严格禁止”党员群众参加共产党领导的反法西斯行动。但是，社会党的广大基层党员却对这种阻挠工人阶级团结的做法越来越感到不满，要求和法国共产党采取一致行动的压力越来越强大。正是因为这样，尽管右翼首领摩勒至今仍然为戴高乐游说奔走，绝大多数的社会党人却和共产党人一起参加了巴黎的反法西斯大示威。民主社会抵抗联盟、激进党和人民共和党的许多党员也参加了这次示威游行。这一切有力地说明：法西斯势力依靠着国内的右派集团和反动将军的支持，得到了国际反动势力的鼓励，虽然可以猖狂一时，但是，法国的命运终归决定于法国人民，决定于法国人民群众的团结一致的斗争，依靠这个斗争，一定能够驱除笼罩着法国的法西斯乌云。
    二十四年前，1934年2月间，法国的法西斯的暴徒曾迫使激进社会党的政府辞职，继而成立的是一个极右的政府。反动势力因而高呼他们已经获得了“胜利”。但是结果怎样呢？工人阶级团结起来了，千千万万法国人民团结起来了，他们的英勇斗争使得法西斯势力遭到了严重的打击。今天，法国人民的力量比二十多年以前大得多了。不但如此，目前的国际形势也和过去大大不同了。当二十多年前，法西斯力量正在世界范围内抬头，全世界广大人民也没有完全认识法西斯主义的危险性。今天，经过反法西斯的第二次世界大战洗礼的世界人民已经深刻地懂得：法西斯主义是一种世界性的灾难；法国人民的反法西斯斗争，也就是全世界进步人类保卫民主、和平和维护民族独立的斗争中的一个重要部分。因此，全世界和平民主力量谴责美国和一切国际反动势力支持法国法西斯势力的阴谋活动，并且支持法国人民保卫民主、和平的斗争。
    当然，对法国人民来说，斗争的任务是极其艰巨的。但是，我们深信，曾经打开了巴士的狱的法国人民，决不会允许法西斯分子把法国再投入一个新的巴士的狱中。久经考验的法国共产党，一定能够团结法国工人阶级和劳动人民以及一切其他民主力量，击败法西斯的进攻。最后的胜利必将属于伟大的法国人民！
