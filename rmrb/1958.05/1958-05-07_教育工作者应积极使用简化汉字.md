    Educators Should Actively Use Simplified Chinese Characters
    The simplification of Chinese characters is the first stage of China's Chinese character reform. Chinese characters have played a significant role in recording the history of the motherland and preserving cultural heritage. However, Chinese characters have four difficulties: difficult to recognize, difficult to remember, difficult to write, and difficult to use, thus hindering the popularization of education and the elimination of illiteracy. Therefore, today the broad masses of people are demanding Chinese character reform.
    Although the simplification of Chinese characters has a significant effect, some people do not pay enough attention to it. More regrettably, some educators cannot correctly use simplified Chinese characters. Therefore, I suggest that in all universities, middle schools, and primary schools, students' compositions and homework should all use the simplified Chinese characters promulgated by the government, and writing the original traditional characters should be counted as a mistake. This requires teachers to take the lead in using simplified Chinese characters and be promoters of writing reform, so that writing reform can be completed as soon as possible.

    教育工作者应积极使用简化汉字
    汉字简化是我国汉字改革的第一阶段。汉字对祖国历史的记载，对文化遗产的记录，都起过很大作用。但汉字有四难：难认，难记，难写，难用，所以对普及教育和扫除文盲起了阻碍作用。所以，今天广大人民要求汉字改革。
    虽然汉字简化有重大作用，可是有些人却重视不够。更遗憾的是有些教育工作者，还不能正确使用简化汉字。因而我建议：凡是大、中小学，学生的作文、作业应一律使用政府公布的简化汉字，再写原先繁体字应当算错字。这就要求教师们带头使用简化汉字，作文字改革的促进派，使文字改革早日完成。
