　　For the purpose of common production increase
　　Heilongjiang Province has planned to establish seed bases for rice, potatoes, corn, and soybeans. Two points are particularly noteworthy:

　　First, they have taken action remarkably early, preparing for next year's great leap forward in production almost a year in advance. This demonstrates their full recognition of the fact that the seed problem is a decisive link in increasing grain production. Second, Heilongjiang is starting from the development of production this year and is consciously breeding fine seeds for fraternal provinces. This is another manifestation of a noble spirit of cooperation. In the past, seed adjustments between different regions were generally based on the transfer of surplus. It is relatively rare to cultivate improved varieties for other provinces in a planned way.

　　We hope that other regions can also learn from Heilongjiang Province, seriously explore folk varieties, widely propagate them, and supply them to fraternal provinces for trial planting, in order to jointly achieve the goal of increasing grain production.

    为了共同增产
    黑龙江省有计划地建立水稻、土豆、玉米、大豆种子基地，有两点很引人注意：
    第一，他们的步子走得真早，为明年生产大跃进的准备工作几乎提前了一年，足见他们充分认识到种子问题是增产粮食的一个有决定意义的环节。第二，黑龙江今年从发展生产上着手，有意识地为兄弟省繁殖优良种子，这又是一种高尚的协作精神的表现。过去，各个地区之间所作的种子调剂工作，一般都是把剩余的外调，有计划地为别省区培植良种还是比较少。
    我们希望其它地区也能像黑龙江省这样，认真地发掘民间良种，广为繁殖，并把它供给兄弟省试种，共同达到增产粮食的目的。
