　　Must Give It a Try
　　Gu Siliang, Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture
　　On the train, several worker comrades were arguing heatedly, gesticulating, and looking like they were studying a technical innovation. Their final conclusion was: "We must give it a try!"
    Must give it a try – what a heroic statement! All creations, inventions, and innovations begin with a try. Of course, trying includes the factors of both success and failure. In fact, nothing can be accomplished in one fell swoop. As long as we persevere, we will eventually succeed.
    However, some people don't even have the courage to try. They are content with the old ways and stick to conventions. They don't seek advancement, only stability. They revel in their existing achievements and are content with the status quo. In the tide of the Great Leap Forward, they merely echo others, follow the crowd, and parrot what others say. For such people, the first step is to encourage them to try.
    I think if everyone tries, and every industry tries, new achievements and new miracles will emerge constantly.

### 一定要试试看

　　一定要试试看
　　江苏省农业厅　顾思良
    在火车上，几个工人同志热烈地争论着，比划着，看神情是在研究一项技术革新，他们最后的结语是：“一定要试试看！”
    一定要试试看，这是多么豪迈的语言！一切创造发明，除旧革新，都是由试试看开端的。当然，试试看里边包括着成功或失败的两方面的因素，而事实上任何事情也都不可能一举而成的，只要坚持不懈，总有一天会得到成功的。
    可是，有的人连试试看的这点勇气都没有。他们因循苟且，墨守陈规。他们不求先进，但求稳当。他们陶醉于既得成绩，安于现状。他们在跃进潮流中，只是随声附和，随波逐流，人云亦云。对这种人，第一步就是要鼓励他们先来试试看。
    我想，如果人人都来试试看，各行各业都试试看，新的成就，新的奇迹，一定会不断涌现。
