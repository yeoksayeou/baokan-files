The steel industry is developing rapidly, achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
Compared to the same period last year (January to April):
　　Pig iron: increased by over 360,000 tons
　　Steel: increased by over 310,000 tons
　　Steel products: increased by 300,000 tons

    (Our dispatch) To realize the call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, the capital construction workers in China's steel industry launched a competition to "double the speed and make one investment do the work of two." Production workers in existing factories and mines are breaking down superstitions, liberating their minds, and constantly creating new "more, faster, better, and more economical" records.

    This year, there are forty-nine steel industry capital construction projects underway (not including the numerous local small-scale steel industries). It is estimated that projects starting construction and going into production this year will add new equipment capable of producing 1.57 million tons of pig iron and 1.03 million tons of steel annually. This nearly equals half the total equipment capacity added during the entire First Five-Year Plan period. The construction speed of twenty-nine key units, including Anshan Iron and Steel, Wuhan Iron and Steel, and Baotou Iron and Steel, during the first four months of this year, is unprecedented. By the end of April, they will have completed more than 22% of the state's original annual plan, equivalent to more than five months' worth of work completed in the first half of last year.

    The five medium-sized iron and steel complexes being newly built and expanded in Hunan, Taiyuan, Shijingshan, Ma'anshan, and Chongqing are breaking past construction conventions and planning to start construction ahead of schedule at an unprecedented new speed. The annual steel output of just these five medium-sized enterprises after they are all completed during the Second Five-Year Plan period will exceed the country's total output in 1957.

    Production news from existing factories and mines is constantly pouring in. From January to April this year, pig iron production increased by more than 360,000 tons compared to the same period last year, steel production increased by more than 310,000 tons, and steel product production increased by 300,000 tons. Blast furnace and open-hearth utilization coefficients—important indicators of untapped potential in steel production—are constantly setting new records. Based on the decreasing trend of the average blast furnace utilization coefficient (the effective volume of the blast furnace required to produce one ton of pig iron) in enterprises under the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, it is possible that it will drop to 0.7 this year. There is even greater potential for increasing the production of steelmaking open-hearth furnaces. The average open-hearth furnace utilization coefficient of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant last year was 10.88 tons (steel output per square meter of furnace hearth). This year's Great Leap Forward target is 12.345, and achieving this target would increase production potential by 44%. In March, the actual average of No. 2 open-hearth furnace already reached 13.51. During the "double-anti" movement, steel workers and technicians began to liberate their thinking, break technical conventions, boldly increase the smelting intensity of blast furnaces, reduce coke ratios, and create new technologies such as multi-tap steel tapping for open-hearth furnaces and three-row tuyeres for converters. The successful three-tap steel tapping created by Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant can increase open-hearth furnace output by more than 40%. Steel plants in Chongqing, Taiyuan, Daye, Tianjin, and Shanghai have all adopted double-tap steel tapping. Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steelmaking Plant successfully tested four-ladle tapping (using four steel ladles to tap steel) in April, which can increase output by 30%. Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant successfully tested double-ladle tapping for electric furnaces, which can also increase output by 40% to 50%. The concentrators of Benxi and Anshan have broken the technical superstition that improving the grade (iron content) of concentrate must necessarily reduce magnetic recovery rate. Recently, the highest concentrate grade reached 65%, and the magnetic recovery rate exceeded 90%, which is equivalent to increasing the production of a lot of ore or steel. During this period, the life of open-hearth furnaces was generally extended, and Chongqing Iron and Steel Plant's small open-hearth furnace set a record of 624 heats. (Photo attached)

    速度快一倍　投资一当二
    钢铁工业多快好省大发展
    今年一至四月的产量和去年同期比较
    生铁　增加　36万多吨
    钢　增加　31万多吨
    钢材　增加　30万吨
    本报讯　我国钢铁工业为了提前实现十五年赶上英国的号召，基本建设工人发动了“速度快一倍，投资一当二”的竞赛。现有厂矿的生产工人破除迷信，解放思想，不断地创造“多快好省”的新纪录。
    今年施工的钢铁工业基本建设项目有四十九个（不包括为数众多的地方小型钢铁工业），预计年内开工投入生产的项目，将使国家增加年产一百五十七万吨生铁和一百零三万吨钢的新设备，几乎达到第一个五年计划期间增加的全部设备能力的一半。包括鞍钢、武钢、包钢在内的二十九个重点单位，今年头四个月的建设速度，更是前所未有。到4月底，可以完成国家原定的全年计划的22％以上，相当于去年上半年五个多月的完成量。
    今年开始新建和扩建的湖南、太原、石景山、马鞍山、重庆等五个中型钢铁联合企业，打破了过去的施工常规，打算以前所未有的新速度着手提前施工。仅仅这五个中型企业在第二个五年计划期间全部建成后的钢铁年产量，就超过1957年全国的总产量。
    现有厂矿的生产捷报频传。今年1月到4月，生铁比去年同期增产三十六万多吨，钢增产三十一万多吨，钢材增产三十万吨。钢铁生产挖掘潜力的重要标志——高炉、平炉的利用系数，不断创造新纪录。根据冶金部所属企业高炉平均利用系数（每产一吨生铁所占高炉有效容积）不断降低的趋势，今年有可能降低到零点七。炼钢平炉的生产潜力有更大的增加。上海第三钢厂去年平炉平均利用系数为10.88吨（每平方公尺炉底的产钢量），今年的跃进指标为12.345，达到这个指标，生产潜力就可增长44％。在3月份，二号平炉实际平均已经达到13.51。在双反运动中，钢铁工人和技术人员思想开始解放，打破技术常规，大胆提高高炉的冶炼强度、降低焦比，创造平炉的多槽出钢，转炉的三排风眼等等新技术。太原钢铁厂创造成功的三槽出钢，可以提高平炉产量40％以上，重庆、太原、大冶、天津、上海的钢厂都已采用双槽出钢。鞍钢第一炼钢厂，在4月份试验成功四包出钢
  （用四个盛钢桶出钢），可以增加产量30％。重庆钢铁厂试验成功电炉双包出钢，产量也能提高40％到50％。本溪和鞍钢的选矿厂打破了过去认为提高精矿的品位（含铁量）必然降低磁收率的技术迷信，最近精矿品位最高能达到65％。磁收率超过90％。等于增产很多矿石或钢铁。这一时期，平炉的炉龄普遍延长，重庆钢铁厂小平炉创造了六百二十四炉的最高纪录。（附图片）
