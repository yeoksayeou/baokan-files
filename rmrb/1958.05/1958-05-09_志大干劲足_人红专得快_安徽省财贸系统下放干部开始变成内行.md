Ambitious and Energetic, People Become Expert Quickly
    Cadres Sent Down from Anhui Province's Finance and Trade System Begin to Become Experts

    (Our reporter Lin Yao reports) Cadres sent down from the finance and trade system in Anhui Province have been diligently studying and practicing technical skills while participating in industrial and agricultural production, quickly transforming from intellectuals who "can't distinguish the five grains" into skilled production experts. The Anhui Province Finance and Trade System Sent-Down Cadre Production Achievements Exhibition, which opened in Beijing on the 5th, focuses on introducing these vivid events, proving that sent-down cadres, through labor training, can not only become "red" but also become "expert."

    Before sending down cadres, the Anhui Province finance and trade system took measures such as sending cadres to factories in other places to study, inviting experienced workers back to the factory to teach, and short-term visits to help cadres understand production technology. However, the most important thing was that the sent-down cadres learned while doing in labor, advancing towards technology with unyielding perseverance. When encountering technical problems that could not be solved, they would consult books, find teachers, and repeatedly experiment until they were completely successful. When the sent-down cadres of the Wuhu Coking Plant encountered many difficulties in experimenting with indigenous coking methods, they finally succeeded after six failures. Although they sent people to other places to learn some basic knowledge of coking, they failed when it came to practice. Most of the coal powder pressed into the kiln was burned into charcoal ash. After two consecutive tests, the coke yield still did not exceed 30%, and the secondary coke rate reached 34%. They held Zhuge Liang meetings to study the reasons for the failure and improved the operating methods, gradually increasing the coke yield to 58%. However, the quality of the coke did not meet the specifications and could not be used for steelmaking or iron smelting. At this time, a few people lost confidence, but most people, under the leadership of the Party organization, insisted on continuing. They invited a technician to provide technical guidance, changed the composition of the raw coal, and improved the tools and kiln burning methods, finally making the quality of coke rise sharply. Now the coke produced by these sent-down cadres is close to the quality of the nationally renowned coke product - Tao Xi Coke, and the coke yield has increased to 63%.

    Many sent-down cadres can not only quickly accept the technology learned from others, but also use their own wisdom combined with theoretical knowledge from books in production to make many improvements to the original operating methods and production tools. A group of cadres from the Anhui Provincial People's Bank sent down to the Wushanling Farm were assigned to beekeeping tasks. Initially, they learned the basic knowledge of beekeeping from nearby farmers and hired a farmer as a technical instructor. After studying for a few months, they were not satisfied with the original beekeeping technology, so they bought many "Beekeeping Science" books from the Soviet Union and China to study. They made many new experiments based on the experience introduced in the books, such as trying to increase the honey collection of bees and improve the breed of queen bees, all of which were very effective. In this way, they quickly became disseminators of new beekeeping technology, teaching scientific beekeeping techniques to local farmers. Fan Chonglu, a sent-down cadre from this farm, has now become a beekeeping expert. He has successively created ten kinds of beekeeping tools and spent more than 30 yuan to purchase Chinese bees to carry out experiments on improving Chinese bees, winning the title of second-class labor model of the farm.

    The revolutionary drive of the sent-down cadres to study technology is generated under the premise of being "red." When they truly realized the great significance of participating in industrial and agricultural labor, they developed the determination and courage to overcome all difficulties. Shi Xueyou, a cadre sent down to the Baimishan Farm, originally disagreed with assigning him to be a feeder, thinking it was a waste of talent. He had no intention of studying pig raising techniques. After the Party organization's multi-faceted help and his own sharp ideological struggle, he realized that developing the pig raising business was also contributing to socialism, and his enthusiasm and drive came. Regardless of the weather, he had to carry a hundred loads of water every day to mix pig feed. When swine fever occurred, he drove the uninfected pigs to the mountains for isolation, living on the mountain for seven days and seven nights, without losing a single pig. He also learned techniques such as diagnosing, injecting, and medicating pigs, becoming an all-round feeder. Therefore, last year, he was recommended by the farm to attend the Anhui Provincial Labor Model Conference and was named a second-class labor model. (Attached pictures)

    Cadres from the Wuhu Commercial Bureau sent down to the Wuhu Coking Plant have used indigenous methods to produce more than 500 tons of coke. This is the coal tar extracted from the coking kiln.

    The waste oil processing plant, designed and decorated by the cadres sent down to Hefei themselves, can now process several types of oil such as engine oil, diesel oil, and Taigu oil. This is a model of the waste oil processing plant.

    Cadres sent down to five pottery factories in Shucheng, Xiuning, and Wuwei, etc., have been able to make novel and popular pottery products.

    The rice hulling machine, rice milling machine, and power equipment used by the mobile rice processing plant composed of sent-down cadres. The total weight is only two tons. This is a model of the rice mill machine.

    Cadres sent down to the Qiuge fan factory in Lu'an County have mastered the craft of making goose feather fans. These are the goose feather fans they made.

    志大干劲足　人红专得快
    安徽省财贸系统下放干部开始变成内行
    本报讯　记者林耀报道：安徽省财贸系统下放干部在参加工农业生产中，勤学苦练、钻研技术，很快地由“五谷不分”的知识分子变成了熟练的生产能手，不少人获得了劳动模范、先进生产者的光荣称号。5日在北京开幕的安徽省财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会，集中地介绍了这些生动的事迹，证明下放干部通过劳动锻炼，不仅能“红”，而且能“专”。
    安徽省财贸系统在下放干部之前，曾采取了派干部到外地工厂去学习、请老师傅回厂传授、短期参观等方式帮助干部了解生产技术。但是最主要的还是下放干部在劳动中边做边学，以百折不挠的毅力向技术进军。遇到技术问题不能解决，他们就查书本、找老师，反复试验直到完全成功为止。芜湖炼焦厂的下放干部在试验土法炼焦时遇到许多困难，经过六次失败最后才获得成功。他们虽然派人到外地学了一些炼焦的基本知识，但到实践时却失败了。压进窑内的煤粉大部分都烧成了炭灰，接连试验了两次，出焦率仍不超过30％，次焦率达到34％。他们就开诸葛亮会，研究失败的原因，改进了操作方法，逐步使出焦率上升到58％，但是焦炭的质量不合乎规格，既不能炼钢也不能化铁。这时，有少数人失去了信心，但是多数人在党组织的领导下，仍坚持干下去，他们请来了一位技师作技术指导，改变了原煤的成分，又改进了工具和烧窑的方法，终于使焦炭质量直线上升。现在这些下放干部生产的焦炭已接近全国名产焦——陶洗焦的质量，出焦率提高到63％。
    许多下放干部不仅能很快地接受从别人那里学来的技术，而且在生产中用自己的智慧结合书本上的理论知识，对于原有的操作方法、生产工具作了很多改进。安徽省人民银行下放到巫山岭农场的干部，有一批人担任养蜂任务。最初他们向附近农民学习了养蜂的基本知识，并且聘请了一位农民担任技术指导。在学习了几个月以后，他们不满足于原有的养蜂技术，就买了苏联和中国的许多“养蜂学”来钻研，根据书本介绍的经验作了许多新的试验，如想办法提高蜜蜂的采蜜量，改进蜂王的品种等等，收效都很大。这样他们很快地就成为新的养蜂技术的传播者，把科学的养蜂技术传授给当地农民。这个农场的下放干部樊崇禄现在已经成为养蜂能手，他先后创造了十种养蜂用的工具，自己还花三十多元购买中蜂进行改良中蜂的试验，获得了农场二等劳动模范的称号。
    下放干部的这种钻研技术的革命干劲，是在“红”的前提下产生的。当他们真正体会到参加工农业劳动的伟大意义后，就产生了克服一切困难的决心和勇气。下放到白米山农场的干部史学友，原来对于分配他做饲养员思想不通，认为这是大材小用，无心钻研养猪技术，经过党组织的多方面帮助，和他自己尖锐的思想斗争，他认识到发展养猪事业同样是为社会主义贡献力量，干劲和钻劲都来了。他不管天气怎样，每天都要挑一百担水拌猪食。发生猪瘟时，他赶着尚未染病的猪到山上去隔离，在山上连住七天七夜，没有使一只猪受到损失。他还学会了给猪看病、打针、喂药等技术，成为一个全能的饲养员。因此去年被农场推选出席了安徽省劳模大会，被评为二等劳动模范。（附图片）
    芜湖商业局下放到芜湖炼焦厂的干部，采用土法炼焦，已经炼出焦炭五百多吨。这是从炼焦窑中提取的煤焦油。
    下放在合肥的干部，自己动手设计、自己装修起来的废机油加工厂，现在已能加工出车用机油、柴油、太古油等数种。这是废油加工厂模型。
    下放到舒城、休宁、无为等五个陶器厂的干部，已经能够作出色泽新颖受到群众欢迎的陶器用品了。
    下放干部组成的流动大米加工厂用的砻谷机、碾米机和动力设备。总共只有两吨重。这是米厂机器的模型。
    下放到六安县裘革扇子厂的干部已经掌握了制鹅毛扇的手艺。这是他们制成的鹅毛扇。
