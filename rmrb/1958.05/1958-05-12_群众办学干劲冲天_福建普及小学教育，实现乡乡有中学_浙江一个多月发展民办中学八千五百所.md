The Masses are Bursting with Enthusiasm for Running Schools
    Fujian Universalizes Primary Education and Achieves a Middle School in Every Township
　　Zhejiang Develops 8,500 Private Middle Schools in Just Over a Month
    According to a Fujian Daily report: Fujian Province has universalized primary education and achieved one or several middle schools in every township; more than 90% of young and middle-aged illiterate people have enrolled in school.
    After the Provincial Party Committee issued the call on March 29th to "Work Hard for Thirty Days to Universalize Primary and Secondary Education," a mass movement of the entire party and all people to run schools was immediately launched across the province, and private middle and primary schools sprung up like mushrooms after a rain. During the upsurge of school establishment, Party Committee secretaries at all levels personally took charge, and education departments and educators demonstrated a revolutionary spirit of hard work, closely combining education with production. They adopted a rapid approach of simultaneous publicity, planning, enrollment, admission, classes, and problem-solving, mobilizing the masses to run schools diligently and frugally. Subsequently, the Propaganda Department of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee promptly convened an on-site conference on universalizing primary and secondary education in Putian, summarizing the school-running experiences of various regions and proposing six measures to consolidate private schools. This conference further boosted the soaring enthusiasm of the entire people for running schools. People in the culturally backward areas of Fu'an, Longyan, Nanping, and other special districts overcame numerous difficulties and established hundreds of middle schools in the shortest possible time; primary schools and kindergartens also spread to remote mountain villages. The literacy campaign climax of "Thousands of troops engage in production during the day, and thousands of households study diligently at night" also rapidly emerged throughout the province.
    Currently, the province has newly established 13,329 private primary schools, with 525,113 students. Combined with the students of existing public and private primary schools, the province now has 2 million primary school students, accounting for 92.54% of the total number of school-age children. 2,310 new private middle schools have been established, with 85,287 students, accounting for 115.5% of the province's graduates from higher primary schools who should be enrolled. Among them, various vocational middle schools such as agricultural middle schools, industrial middle schools, forestry middle schools, handicraft middle schools, and fishing middle schools account for 2,132. 19,746 new kindergarten classes have been established, with 233,051 children enrolled. 3,113,433 illiterate people in the province have enrolled in school, accounting for 90.24% of the young and middle-aged illiterate population. 307 communes, towns, streets, and factories have achieved complete literacy. In addition, more than 7,700 part-time primary school classes, more than 1,000 part-time middle school classes, and eight night universities have been developed.
    At present, various regions are implementing various measures in accordance with the provincial party committee's instructions of "Develop one school, consolidate one school, develop one class, consolidate one class," to vigorously consolidate private schools. Putian, Jinjiang, and other regions have begun training teachers for private schools to improve their ideological and teaching levels.
    According to a Zhejiang Daily report: Private agricultural middle schools are blooming everywhere in Zhejiang Province. By the end of April, in just over a month, the province had established 8,516 agricultural, forestry, water conservancy, fishery, sericulture, animal husbandry, tea, and other vocational middle schools, with 353,000 students, basically achieving a middle school in every township. At present, various regions are actively taking measures to consolidate and improve agricultural middle schools.
    The large-scale establishment of agricultural middle schools throughout the province not only meets the requirements of rural educated youth to continue their studies, but has also begun to promote advanced production technologies and promote the technical innovation movement. After taking the "close planting" technology course in the four newly established agricultural middle schools in Baiyang Township, Yuhang County, students immediately carried out rice transplanting practice. Recently, these four agricultural middle schools launched a major technical innovation competition. They also compiled the technical course into private school teaching materials and went to eight private schools in the township to teach new technologies. Many agricultural middle school students in Xinchang County have become double-wheeled double-shared plowmen. Students in Wufeng Agricultural Middle School not only made rice transplanters and rice transplanting frames for production teams to use, but also promoted the technology of "preventing seedling rot" in the production teams, improving the growth of seedlings. Because agricultural middle schools have implemented the policies of mass participation, frugal management, and work-study programs, students learn while producing, learning both culture, politics, and technology, which is very popular with the masses, parents, and students.
    At present, the province is actively taking measures to focus on consolidating and improving agricultural middle schools. Some organize teaching and research groups by sub-township and sub-district to regularly study teaching. Some establish agricultural middle school guidance networks with ordinary middle schools as the mainstay. Some hold short-term teacher training classes or lesson preparation classes during vacations. Jiaxing, Jiande, and other special districts hold on-site meetings to exchange teaching experiences. Weiping District of Chun'an County also organizes cadres, teachers, and students to visit other agricultural middle schools to learn from experience. Jiaxing, Huzhou, and Qu County have also established agricultural universities and teachers' colleges to solve the problem of teachers for agricultural middle schools.

　　群众办学干劲冲天
    福建普及小学教育，实现乡乡有中学
　　浙江一个多月发展民办中学八千五百所
    本报讯　据福建日报报道：福建省已普及小学教育；实现乡乡有一所到几所中学；90％以上青壮年文盲已经入学。
    3月29日，省委发出“苦战三十天普及初中小学教育”的号召后，各地立即掀起了全党动手，全民办学的热潮，民办中、小学如雨后春笋蓬勃发展。在办学高潮中，各地党委书记亲自挂帅，教育部门和教育工作者拿出了苦干到底的革命干劲，紧密结合生产，采取边宣传、边规划、边招生、边入学、边上课和边解决具体问题的快速作法，发动群众勤俭办学。接着，中共福建省委宣传部及时地在莆田召开了普及中小学教育的现场会议，总结了各地办学经验，提出了巩固民办学校的六项措施。这个会议进一步鼓起了全民办学的冲天干劲。文化落后的福安、龙岩、南平等专区人民，克服重重困难，在最短时间内创办了几百所中学；小学和幼儿园也遍及边远山村。“白天千军万马忙生产，夜晚万家千户勤读书”的识字运动高潮也在全省各地迅速出现。
    现在，全省新办的民办小学有一万三千三百二十九所，学生达五十二万五千一百十三人，加上原有公立和民办小学的学生，全省已有小学生二百万人，占学龄儿童总数92.54％。新办民办中学二千三百一十所，学生达八万五千二百八十七人，占全省应入学的历届高小毕业生数115.5％，其中农业中学、工业中学、林业中学、手工业中学和渔业中学等各类职业中学占二千一百三十二所。新办幼儿园一万九千七百四十六班，入学幼儿达二十三万三千零五十一人。全省文盲已入学三百十一万三千四百三十三人，占青壮年文盲数90.24％，无文盲的社、镇、街、厂已达三百零七个。此外还发展了业余小学七千七百多班，业余中学一千多班，夜大学八所。
    目前，各地正根据省委提出的“发展一校，巩固一校，发展一班，巩固一班”的指示，采取各项措施，大力巩固民办学校。莆田、晋江等地已开始训练民办学校教师，提高民办教师思想水平和教学水平。
    本报讯　据浙江日报报道：浙江省民办农业中学遍地开花。到4月底，一个多月里，全省已办起农业以及林业、水利、渔业、蚕桑、畜牧、茶叶等职业中学八千五百一十六所，入校学生达三十五万三千人，基本实现了乡乡有中学。目前，各地正积极采取措施，以巩固和提高农业中学。
    全省各地大办农业中学，不但满足了农村知识青年继续升学的要求，而且已经开始推广先进生产技术，促进技术革新运动。余杭县百杨乡新办的四所农业中学上了“密植”技术课后，学生立即进行插秧实习。最近，这四所农业中学开展了技术革新大竞赛，他们还把技术课编成了民校教材，分头到全乡八所民校去传授新技术。新昌县很多农业中学学生已成为双轮双铧犁手，五峰农业中学学生不但做了插秧船、插秧架等给生产小队使用，还在生产队里推广“防治烂秧”的技术，使秧苗生长情况好转。由于农业中学贯彻了群众办学、勤俭办学、勤工俭学的方针，学生一面生产，一面学习，既学了文化，又学了政治、技术，群众、家长、学生十分欢迎。
    目前，全省正在积极采取措施，着重进行巩固、提高农业中学的工作。有些分乡分片组织教研组，定期研究教学。有些以普通中学为主，建立农业中学辅导网。有些在假期举办短期师资训练班或备课班。嘉兴、建德等专区召开现场会议交流教学经验。淳安县威坪区还组织干部、教师、学生到别的农业中学参观，以吸取经验。嘉兴、湖州、衢县还办起了农业大学和师范专科学校，解决农业中学的师资问题。
