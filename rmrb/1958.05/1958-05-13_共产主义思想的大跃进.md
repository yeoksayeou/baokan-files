　　The Great Leap Forward of Communist Ideology
　　First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Lin Tie

    Under the leadership of the Party, the people of Hebei Province have demonstrated an extremely great communist spirit in implementing the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" formulated by Comrade Mao Zedong. This spirit is the most vivid manifestation of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought grasping the masses of people and generating great material strength among the people. It is precisely because of the growth of the communist spirit among the people that the time and distance for us to build socialism and move towards communism will be shortened.

    Productive forces, liberated from the shackles of the old ownership, have unlimited possibilities for leaping development on the broad road opened up for them by socialist ownership. However, it cannot be said that productive forces are completely and thoroughly liberated. When the relationship between people in the labor process still contains old remnants, and when some cadres still have "three winds" and "five airs," and when the working people, as social productive forces, are still bound by various old ideas, viewpoints, and habits, people often dare not think and dare not act. The old mental shackles bind their hands and feet, making them afraid to stand up straight and be the true masters of their own lives. Only when people are also liberated from the influence of bourgeois ideology and backward habits, that is, after a revolution in political thought and the establishment of socialist ideology, can they develop by leaps and bounds and truly enter an era of consciously creating their own history and mastering their own destiny. The people of Hebei Province, especially the broad masses of workers and peasants, have, like all parts of the country, done things in socialist construction that were unimaginable to their predecessors, with the fundamental reason lying here.

    For more than half a year, agriculture has taken the lead, promoting a comprehensive leap forward in production. The irrigated area of farmland in the province has increased from 27 million mu to 80 million mu. The work done in one winter and spring is equivalent to twice the irrigated area developed by predecessors over the past thousands of years before liberation, and more than three times the total irrigated area developed in the eight years since the founding of the country. 21 million mu of low-lying land has also been basically transformed, half of which has become high-yield paddy fields. 22.6 million mu of afforestation has been carried out, 70 percent more than the total afforestation area in the past eight years; more than 1.3 billion scattered trees have been planted, half more than the total number of trees planted in the past eight years. In particular, under the threat of drought for nearly 300 days without rain, all the peasants fought hard for a month to "ensure sowing without rain" and basically completed the spring sowing task on time. This was unimaginable and impossible in the past. With the great leap forward in agriculture, the great leap forward in industry has also closely followed. The output value of more than 1,700 large and medium-sized central and local enterprises in the province in the first four months of this year exceeded the leap forward plan by 5.06 percent, an increase of 37.36 percent over the same period last year; more importantly, good news of technological innovation and the successful trial manufacture of new products is pouring in like snowflakes. More than 1,500 new products have been successfully trial-manufactured in four months, fully demonstrating the creative spirit of the vast number of employees. These victories are the victories of the communist spirit.

    Let me first give a few examples to illustrate how people's mental outlook has changed.

    The Bashang Plateau in northwestern Hebei Province is a "yellowing" area, suffering from drought. The Provincial Party Committee called on the people of the province to support the greening of Bashang. People responded enthusiastically to this call, providing tree seeds where they had tree seeds and donating saplings where they had saplings, sending more than 1 million jin of tree seeds and more than 10 million saplings. When various counties mobilized tens of thousands of carts to transport these things, various townships and communes rushed to sign up, bringing their own food. The carts and horses traveled along the way, staying wherever they went, and the masses automatically offered firewood without charge.

    Supporting others with a spirit of self-sacrifice is because many people regard the difficulties of others as their own difficulties, the victories of others as their own victories, and the happiness of others as their own happiness in the desire to achieve a common leap forward. For example, when hundreds of young people in Xinle County, carrying quilts and seedlings, marched nearly 200 li with their heads held high and singing loudly, climbing the high mountains of Jingxing County to help with greening, they thought that what they were doing was not just helping others, but building socialism, and precisely for themselves. They carried buckets of water from the foot of the mountain to the top of the mountain 1,500 meters high, and their slogan was: "Plant socialist trees and root communist roots!" Their shoes were broken, and their feet bled. What did they say? "Sweat must be shed, blood must flow, we will not give up until the barren mountains are green!" What a noble communist spirit, what a great communist spirit! The people who were supported used "Xinle" and "Greening" as the names of their mountain gullies and children to commemorate this communist friendship towards them.

    This mutual support began between communes and townships, and later developed into a province-wide, county-to-county, and city-to-countryside mutual support. From water conservancy afforestation to drought-resistant sowing, the number of agricultural commune members who went to other counties on expeditions reached more than 1.3 million. Mutual support has become an important form for the people of the province to complete a difficult task as soon as possible. This vast number of people supporting other counties has become countless armies propagating communist ideology.

    After the rectification campaign, the relationship between the industrial and commercial sectors has also undergone great changes. In the past, when dealing with mutual relations, under the domination of departmentalism and individualism, they only cared about small profits and did not consider the big picture, only saw money and did not see politics, and often had endless "wrangling." After the rectification campaign, the relationship between industry and commerce changed from competing for profits to giving up profits, and from "wrangling" to active cooperation. After the Shijiazhuang Department Store Wholesale Station priced the products of the knitting factory, the factory took the initiative to reduce the price by 5%. The staff of the commercial department said, "You are not surnamed worker, and I am not surnamed merchant, we are all surnamed state." The two sides took the initiative to arrange production and sales cooperation, one wanted to produce more, and the other wanted to sell more. This shows that with "virtual" driving the "real," once the ideology is clear, everything will be clear.

    The change in people's thinking can also be fully illustrated by the attitude of an ordinary fitter towards the technical innovation movement. Wang Shutian, a fitter at the North China Sewing Machine Factory in Tianjin, worked hard and put forward 25 proposals for innovative technologies. After the Party organization sent people to help him fully realize his proposals, all the workers wanted to learn from Wang Shutian as an example and launched a heat wave of "learning from Wang Shutian and catching up with Wang Shutian," and quickly put forward more than 370 technical innovation proposals. The implementation of these proposals will greatly improve labor productivity, and the factory will be able to save more than 100,000 man-hours. Wang Shutian said, "In the past, I studied technology to get bonuses, but now it is for socialism." The important issue is not only that Wang Shutian has the communist conscious creative spirit, but also that all the ordinary workers in the factory took him as an example and formed a torrent advancing towards socialism.

    This selfless assistance, active cooperation, mutual learning, and mutual promotion of comradely relations between people, between superiors and subordinates, between left and right, and between regions; the general increase in the revolutionary spirit of being confident, full of energy, and unafraid of difficulties in socialist construction and in the struggle with nature; the spirit of courage to create, dare to innovate, and self-sacrifice shown in labor, is precisely the spirit of communism.

    If our country is to be built into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture in the shortest possible period, and if we are to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in fifteen years, the growth of the communist spirit among our people shows that they are united as a whole and are courageously advancing towards the great goal indicated by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong. From this spirit, we also see that although the cause we are engaged in is arduous and difficult, we will certainly achieve this great goal. The important significance of the widespread growth of the communist spirit lies here.

    The reason why I want to cite some of the above facts to illustrate the communist spirit shown by the masses in the struggle of socialist construction is that although the masses have created great achievements with this spirit, some people still do not fully recognize its importance. Some of them think that this is not a communist spirit, but just a burst of energy, and it will be over after it is over; some think that it is abnormal and excessive for the masses to support others with their labor and the spirit of self-sacrifice in labor; and some even think that this spirit should not be vigorously promoted among the masses, thinking that this approach is divorced from reality. Why do these people have such erroneous views? The main reason is that they have not yet been liberated from the shackles of outdated prejudices and conservative ideas, and have fallen behind the awakening and actions of the masses. They have not seen that the emergence and growth of this communist spirit among the masses is not accidental, but the result of the great victory of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front; it is the result of the Party leading the masses to use great democracy, big contending, big debate, and big-character posters to develop criticism and self-criticism and improve the masses' sense of being masters of their own affairs; it is the result of the Party opposing right-leaning conservative ideas; it is the result of our Party organizations working according to the working methods instructed by Chairman Mao. In short, it is the result of our Party organization acting as a promoter, not a demoter. At the same time, it is also inevitable for the vast working people to emerge under the leadership of the Party in the struggle to implement the general line of socialist construction; this is the inevitable result of the two-sided liberation of people's thinking after the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front on the basis of socialist ownership. On the one hand, in the struggle between the two roads, from the enormous superiority shown by socialist ownership, the broad masses of people have further realized that the capitalist road is painful and cannot be taken, and the socialist road is the only road for the working people to happiness. People also understand that personal interests depend on collective interests, current interests depend on long-term interests, and personal happiness depends on the realization of socialist ideals. When consciousness is raised, enthusiasm will naturally increase. On the other hand, in the struggle with nature, people have also been liberated from the conservative ideas of not believing in collective strength developed from the vulnerable position of small producers, and dare to think about things that they did not dare to think about in the past, and dare to do things that they did not dare to do in the past. They understand that conquering nature and realizing the slogan of "changing the face of the country with three years of hard work" cannot be achieved with ordinary enthusiasm and the strength of a commune or a township. It is necessary to arouse greater enthusiasm, and to unite, cooperate, and support each other on a larger scale of the entire society in order to achieve it. The enthusiasm shown by the masses is precisely the spirit that people who engage in communist undertakings should have, and only with this spirit can the cause of communism be achieved.

    To regard what is essentially a completely normal phenomenon of the great leap forward of communist ideology among the people as abnormal can only show how abnormal the thinking of these people is. If we do not call the spirit of people's selfless struggle to realize the ideals of socialism and communism, that is, to resolutely implement the general line of socialist construction put forward by Chairman Mao, the communist spirit, what else should we call it? How can we imagine that the things done by the masses with the communist spirit are excessive? One of the reasons they say that communists should not vigorously promote the communist spirit among the masses is that it is divorced from reality to promote communist ideas and spirit now. Because the principle of communism is to each according to his ability, to each according to his needs. This understanding is superficial. In fact, since the publication of the Communist Manifesto, communists have been promoting communist ideas. If communists do not vigorously promote and encourage the communist spirit among the masses, what else should they promote and encourage? For communist ideas, not only is there too much promotion, but it is necessary to carry out promotion more frequently and deeply. How can we confuse the principle of each according to his ability, to each according to his needs implemented by communism with the ideas and spirit shown by people in the process of struggling to realize this ideal? One of the serious tasks of our Party is to use this communist spirit to cultivate and educate our people. Some places have not paid attention to the great spirit shown by the masses, or have not actively used this spirit to educate the masses, so the work in these places has lagged behind.

    All those who have the above erroneous ideas should go to the reality more, go deep into the masses, learn from the communist spirit of the masses in the struggle to build socialism, arm themselves with this spirit, and advance together with the masses.

     "Qi can be boosted, but not leaked," if this kind of thinking is not criticized and those who have these ideas are not helped to progress, they will pour cold water on the communist spirit of the masses. Therefore, it is very necessary to overcome the above erroneous understanding. We must cherish the communist spirit shown by the masses in the struggle, consolidate this spirit, vigorously promote this spirit, and rely on this spirit of the masses to complete the historical tasks of the new technological revolution and cultural revolution.

    In our future work and practical struggle, we must more deeply promote Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, educate the masses with the communist spirit that the masses have already shown, and constantly improve the communist consciousness of the masses. We must further develop criticism and self-criticism among the masses, and encourage the communist style of the masses daring to speak and dare to act. From the repeated struggle between advanced and backward, collectivism and individualism, socialist ideology and capitalist ideology, we must further liberate and improve the thinking of the masses.

    The communist spirit and the "three winds" and "five airs" are absolutely incompatible. The more "three winds" and "five airs" there are, the less communist spirit there will be. Thoroughly reversing the "three winds" and "five airs" of the leading organs and enterprise management personnel will promote the development of the communist spirit of the broad masses. The rectification movement will soon enter the fourth stage, and any unit and individual must seriously examine and eliminate their own "three winds" and "five airs" and develop the communist spirit and communist style.

    Of course, we must never understand that developing the great and lofty spirit of self-sacrifice of the masses in socialist construction means that we can ignore the lives of the masses; on the contrary, we must pay more attention to the lives of the masses while developing this spirit. Pay attention to organizing production rhythmically, and guide the enthusiasm of the masses and the enthusiasm for improving labor intensity to improving labor productivity by innovating technology. When actively advocating mutual support and organizing the masses to support each other, we should pay attention to overall planning to avoid the phenomenon of neglecting one thing while attending to another. At the same time, we should use the great friendly support of the masses to help those places that need help the most and to solve the most difficult special tasks. Actively advocate cooperation in all aspects, this cooperation should not only pay attention to the relationship between the two sides, but also pay attention to the coordination and the relationship between all relevant aspects. Strengthen the leadership and planning of cooperation to make cooperation planned.

    At present, our most urgent and serious task is to fully rely on and further develop the communist spirit of the masses, and to persist in carrying out arduous struggles to realize this year's plan for a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Drought is still seriously threatening agricultural production in our province, but one of the characteristics of the communist spirit is that it is not afraid of difficulties and is good at overcoming difficulties. Since we have done "ensure sowing without rain," we must strive to "ensure a good harvest without rain."

    Develop the spirit of communism and make greater contributions to the cause of communism. This is the sacred duty of us communists.

　　共产主义思想的大跃进
　　中共河北省委第一书记　林铁
    河北省人民在党的领导下，在执行毛泽东同志制定的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义”的总路线中表现了极其伟大的共产主义精神。这种精神，正是毛泽东同志的思想掌握了人民群众，而在人民群众中产生伟大物质力量的最生动的表现。正是由于人民中共产主义精神的增长，必将缩短我们建成社会主义和走向共产主义的时间和路程。
    生产力从旧的所有制束缚下解放出来，在社会主义所有制为它开辟的广阔道路上，有了飞跃发展的无限可能性。但是，还不能说生产力就是完全和彻底解放了。当劳动过程中人与人的关系还存在着旧的残余，部分干部中间还存在“三风”“五气”的时候，作为社会生产力的劳动人民，还受着种种旧的思想、观点和习惯束缚的时候，人们就常常不敢想，不敢干。旧的精神锁链，捆绑着自己的手脚，不敢挺起腰来干，来作自己生活的真正主人。只有当人们从资产阶级思想和落后习惯的影响下也解放出来，就是说经过了政治思想上的革命，树立了社会主义的思想的时候，才能够飞跃的发展，真正进入自觉的创造自己历史、掌握自己命运的时代。河北全省人民，首先是广大工、农群众，与全国各地一样，以排山倒海之势，在社会主义建设上，干出了前人难以想像的事，根本原因也就在这里。
    半年多以来，农业一马当先，促进了生产的全面大跃进。全省农田灌溉面积由二千七百万亩发展到八千万亩，一个冬春干下的事，等于解放前几千年历代先人所发展的灌溉面积的两倍，超过了建国八年来发展灌溉面积总和的三倍以上。二千一百万亩低洼地，也基本上得到了改造，其中有半数变成了高产的稻田。造林二千二百六十万亩，比八年来造林面积的总和还多了百分之七十；零星植树十三亿多株，比八年来植树的总和还多一半。特别是，在近三百天没有落雨的干旱威胁下，全体农民为了“无雨保播种”，鏖战一月，基本上按时完成了春季播种任务。这是在过去不能想像的，也是不可能做到的。随着农业的大跃进，工业的大跃进也紧紧赶上来了。全省一千七百多个中央和地方较大企业，在今年头四个月的产值，超过了跃进计划的百分之五点○六，比去年同期产值增加了百分之三十七点三六；更重要的是技术革新和新产品试制成功的喜报，有如雪片飞来。在四个月内试制成功的新产品有一千五百多种，充分表现了广大职工的创造精神。这些胜利就是共产主义精神的胜利。
    让我首先举几个例子来说明人们的精神面貌起了怎样的变化。
    我省西北坝上高原，一片“黄化”，苦于干旱。省委号召全省人民支援坝上绿化。人们热烈地响应了这个号召，有树种的出树种，有树苗的赠树苗，送去树种一百多万斤，树苗一千多万斤。当各县动员上万辆大车运送这些东西时，各乡各社争先报名，自带粮草。车马在途中，走到那里，宿到那里，群众自动献柴，不要代价。
    用自我牺牲的精神支援别人，是由于很多人在为实现共同跃进的愿望中，把别人的困难看作自己的困难，把别人的胜利看作自己的胜利，把别人的幸福看作自己的幸福。又如新乐县的几百青年，背着被子和树秧，挺胸高歌，步行近二百里，爬上井陉县的高山帮助进行绿化的时候，他们想到自己干的事，不只是在帮助别人，而是在建设社会主义，也正是为了自己。他们把一桶桶水从山下提到一千五百公尺高的山顶上，他们的口号是：“种下社会主义树，扎下共产主义根！”鞋子破了，脚流出血。他们怎么说呢？“汗要出，血要流，不绿荒山不罢休！”这是多么高尚的共产主义精神，多么伟大的共产主义气魄！被支援的人把“新乐”、“绿化”作为他们山沟的和孩子的名字，来纪念这种对他们的共产主义友情。
    这种互相支援开始是社社、乡乡之间，后来发展为全省性的，县和县、城市和乡村的相互支援。从水利植树造林到抗旱播种，农业社员到外县远征的人数达到一百三十余万人。互相支援已成为全省人民尽快地完成某项艰巨任务的一种重要形式。这种支援外县的广大群众，成了无数支宣传共产主义思想的大军。
    经过整风，工业部门和商业部门之间的关系也起了很大的变化，过去他们在处理相互关系时，由于在本位主义、个人主义思想支配下，只计小利，不算大账，只见钱，不见政治，经常无休止的“扯皮”。在整风之后，工商之间由争利变为让利，由“扯皮”变为积极协作了。石家庄市百货批发站给针织厂的产品核价后，工厂又主动降价5％。商业部门的人员说“你不姓工，我也不姓商，咱们都姓国了”。双方主动安排了产销协作，一个要多产，一个要多销。这说明了，以“虚”带“实”，思想通了，就会“一通百通”。
    从一个普通的钳工以什么态度对待技术革新运动，也可以充分说明人们思想面貌的变化。天津市华北缝纫厂钳工王叔田，苦心钻研，提出了二十五项革新技术的倡议。党的组织派人帮助他完全实现了自己的倡议以后，全体工人都要学习王叔田这个榜样，掀起了“学王叔田，赶王叔田”的热潮，迅速提出了三百七十多项技术革新的倡议。实现这些倡议，就会使劳动生产率大大提高，全厂就能节约十万以上的工时。王叔田说：“过去我钻研技术是为了得奖金，现在是为了社会主义。”重要的问题不只是王叔田有了共产主义的自觉的创造精神，而且全厂的普通工人都拿他作了榜样，汇成了向社会主义前进的洪流。
    这种在人和人之间，上下左右之间，地区和地区之间的无私援助，积极协作，互相学习，互相促进的同志式的关系的发展；在社会主义建设中，在和自然界作斗争中，信心百倍，干劲十足，不怕困难的革命精神的普遍增长；在劳动中表现出来的勇于创造，敢于革新和自我牺牲的精神，正是共产主义的精神。
    我们要在最短的时期内把我们国家建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，我们要在十五年赶上和超过英国，我们人民中间的共产主义精神的增长，就是表明他们团结为一个整体，向着党和毛泽东同志指示的这个伟大目标奋勇前进。从这种精神中也使我们看到了，尽管我们所干的事业是艰巨的，有困难的，但是我们一定会达到这个伟大的目标。共产主义精神普遍增长的重要意义，也就在这里。
    我所以要举出上面一些事实说明群众在社会主义建设的斗争中表现出来的共产主义精神，是由于尽管群众以这种精神创造了丰功伟绩，但至今仍然有一些人对它的重要意义认识不足。他们有的认为，这不是什么共产主义精神，不过是一鼓作气，过去以后就完了；有的认为，群众以自己的劳动去支援别人和在劳动中的自我牺牲精神，是不正常的，过火的；甚至也有的人认为，不应该在群众中大力宣传这种精神，认为这种作法是脱离实际的。为什么这些人会存在这样一些错误观点呢？主要是因为他们还没有从陈旧的偏见和保守观念束缚下解放出来，落在了群众觉悟和群众行动的后面。他们没有看到群众中这种共产主义精神的出现和增长并不是偶然的，这是政治思想战线上社会主义革命取得伟大胜利的结果；是党领导群众运用大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报，发展了批评与自我批评，提高了群众的主人翁的思想的结果；是党反对了右倾保守思想的结果；是我们党组织按照毛主席指示的工作方法进行工作的结果。总之，是由于我们党的组织作了促进派，而不是促退派的结果。同时，也是广大劳动人民在党的领导下，在执行社会主义建设的总路线的斗争中所必然要出现的；这是在社会主义所有制的基础上，经过政治思想上的社会主义革命，人们的思想在两个方面得到了解放的必然结果。一方面，在两条道路斗争中，从社会主义所有制显示的巨大优越性当中；广大群众进一步认识到资本主义道路是痛苦的，不能走的，社会主义道路是劳动人民通向幸福的唯一道路。人们也懂得了个人利益依存于集体利益，目前利益依存于长远利益，个人幸福依存于社会主义理想的实现。觉悟提高了，干劲自然就大了。另一方面，在和自然界作斗争中，人们又从小生产者的脆弱地位养成的不相信集体力量的保守思想下解放了出来，敢于去想过去不敢想的事，敢于去作过去不敢作的事。懂得了征服自然、实现“苦干三年，改变面貌”的口号，用平常的干劲和一社一乡的力量是办不到的。必须鼓起更大的干劲，以整个社会的规模，在更大的范围内联合、协作、互相支援，才能办得到。群众所表现出来的这种干劲，正是干共产主义事业的人应有的精神，只有这种精神，共产主义的事业才干得成。
    把实质上是共产主义思想在人民群众中的大跃进这样一种完全正常的现象，看作是不正常的，只能说明这些人的思想是多么不正常。如果不把人们为了实现社会主义和共产主义的理想，也就是为了坚决贯彻执行毛主席所提出的社会主义建设的总路线，进行忘我的斗争所表现的精神，叫作共产主义精神，又叫作什么呢？怎么可以设想，把群众以共产主义精神干出来的事，看作是过火的呢？他们所说的共产党人不应该在群众中大力宣传共产主义精神的一个理由是，在现在宣传共产主义思想和精神是脱离实际的。因为共产主义的原则是各尽所能、各取所需。这种认识是肤浅的。其实，自从共产党宣言发布以来，共产党人就一直在宣传共产主义思想。共产党人如果不在群众中大力宣传和鼓励共产主义精神，又去宣传和鼓励什么呢？对于共产主义的思想，不是宣传得多了，而是要更经常更深入地进行宣传。怎么可以把共产主义所实行的各尽所能、各取所需的原则，和人们在为了实现这个理想而斗争的过程中所表现的思想和精神，混同起来呢？我们党的严重任务之一，就是要用这种共产主义精神去培养教育自己的人民。有些地方没有重视群众所表现的这种伟大的精神，或者没有积极用这种精神去教育群众，所以这些地方的工作就落后了。
    所有存在以上错误思想的人，应该多去接触实际，深入群众，学习群众为建设社会主义而斗争的共产主义精神，用这种精神来武装自己，和群众一起前进。
      “气可鼓，而不可泄”，不批判这种思想，帮助有这些思想的人进步，他们就会对群众的共产主义精神泼冷水。因此，克服上述错误认识，是十分必要的。我们必须爱护群众在斗争中所表现的共产主义精神，要巩固这种精神，要用大力发扬这种精神，并且依靠着群众这种精神去完成新的技术革命和文化革命的历史任务。
    我们要在今后的工作和实际斗争中，更加深入地宣传毛泽东同志的思想，用群众已经表现出来的共产主义精神教育群众，使群众的共产主义觉悟不断的提高。要进一步发展群众中的批评与自我批评，鼓励群众敢说敢干的共产主义风格。从先进和落后、集体主义和个人主义、社会主义思想和资本主义思想的反复斗争中，进一步解放和提高群众的思想。
    共产主义精神和“三风”、“五气”是绝对不相容的。那里的三风、五气多些，那里的共产主义精神就会少些。彻底反掉领导机关和企业管理人员的三风、五气，就会促进广大群众共产主义精神的发扬。整风运动即将先后进入第四阶段，任何一个单位和个人都必须认真检查，清除自己的三风、五气，发扬共产主义精神和共产主义风格。
  当然，绝不能把发扬群众在社会主义建设中伟大崇高的自我牺牲精神，了解为可以不去关心群众生活；相反地，我们要在发扬这种精神的同时，更加关心群众的生活。注意组织有节奏的生产，把群众的干劲，提高劳动强度的积极性，引导到从革新技术来提高劳动生产率。在积极提倡相互支援，组织群众相互支援的时候，要注意统筹安排，避免顾此失彼的现象发生。同时，要把群众的这种伟大友谊的支援，用于帮助那些最需要帮助的地方，以及解决最困难的特殊任务。积极提倡各方面的协作，这种协作不能只是注意双方的关系，还要注意协调和有关各方面的关系。加强对协作的领导和规划，使协作计划化。
    目前，我们最紧迫而又严重的任务是，必须充分依靠和进一步发扬群众的共产主义精神，为实现今年工、农业生产大跃进的计划，坚持进行顽强的斗争。干旱仍然严重地威胁着我省的农业生产，但是，共产主义精神的特色之一，就是不怕困难和善于克服困难。我们既然做了“无雨保播种”，就更必须力争作到“无雨保丰收”。
    发扬共产主义的精神，为共产主义的事业作出更大的贡献。这就是我们共产党人神圣的职责。
