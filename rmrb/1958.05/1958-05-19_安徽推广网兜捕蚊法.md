　　Anhui Promotes Mosquito Netting Method
    (Our report) The method of catching flying mosquitoes with nets has been widely promoted in Anhui.
    As the weather warms up, overwintering mosquitoes hiding in tree holes, bamboo forests, ditches, pits, and other places have begun to take flight. Every evening, many mosquitoes fly in the air in places with many trees and overgrown weeds. In March, Hefei City caught more than 380,000 boxes of mosquitoes with nets.
    The Anhui Provincial Headquarters for Eliminating the Four Pests has researched this mosquito-catching tool and studied the activity patterns of mosquitoes in spring and summer. Mosquitoes generally hide during the day and are not easy to find, but they take flight in the evening. By seizing the opportunity when mosquitoes fly in groups in the evening and using nets to catch them, a destructive blow can be dealt to the mosquitoes. The net is a round bag made of gauze, large at the top and pointed at the bottom, tied to a bamboo pole. The net is easy to manufacture and very economical. (Qin Yuzhen)

　　安徽推广网兜捕蚊法
    本报讯　用网兜捕捉起飞蚊虫的方法已在安徽普遍推广。
    由于天气渐暖，有些栖藏在树洞、竹林、水沟、坑洼等处的过冬蚊虫已经起飞。每到傍晚，在树木较多、杂草丛生的地方，有很多蚊虫在空中飞舞。合肥市在3月份用网兜捕捉蚊虫三十八万多盒。
    安徽省除四害总指挥部对这种捕蚊工具进行了研究，并研究了春、夏蚊子活动规律。蚊子一般都是白天分散隐蔽，不易寻找，傍晚起飞。抓紧傍晚蚊子成群飞舞的时机，利用网兜捕捉，就能给蚊子以歼灭性的打击。网兜是用纱布做成的一个圆袋，头大尾尖，绑在竹竿上。网兜制造简便，又很经济。（秦聿震）
