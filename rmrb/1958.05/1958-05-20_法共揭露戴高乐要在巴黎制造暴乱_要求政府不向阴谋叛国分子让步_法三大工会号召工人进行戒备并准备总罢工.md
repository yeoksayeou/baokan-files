Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 19th: French extreme right-wing elements continue their rampant activities in Algeria and France, attempting to create a situation for a political change so that De Gaulle can take over the government. National democratic forces are urgently mobilizing, preparing to launch a large-scale counterattack against the fascist conspiracy.

De Gaulle himself is scheduled to hold his first press conference in four years at a hotel near the French National Assembly in Paris at 2:00 PM Greenwich time today. He will use this gathering as a pretext to explain his statement on the 15th about preparing to assume power, to further promote the idea of him taking power, in order to openly mobilize domestic colonialist-fascist elements who support him and intensify the creation of a riotous situation.

In a statement issued last night, the French Communist Party exposed that De Gaulle's press conference "is intended as an excuse to mobilize treasonous troops in the capital." The Communist Party demanded that the government refuse to concede to treasonous conspirators and dismiss the rebellious generals from their military posts. "L'Humanité Dimanche" pointed out that De Gaulle is the center of the conspiracy against the Republic, and he must be prohibited from holding a press conference.

The leaders of France's three largest trade unions, the General Confederation of Labour (CGT), the General Confederation of Labour-Workers' Force (CGT-FO), and the French Confederation of Christian Workers (CFTC), issued instructions to their respective members on the 18th, requiring workers to enter a state of alert from noon on the 19th. They also announced that they would call for a general strike to defend democratic freedom if necessary. The Paris Regional Trade Union Federation, led by the CGT, called on Parisian workers to hold rallies at their workplaces at the same time as De Gaulle's press conference at 2:00 PM Greenwich time today, and to be ready at any time to launch a mass counterattack against any attempt at a fascist demonstration. The French Teachers' Union, representing 240,000 members, also stated on the same day that it would hold a general strike if necessary to oppose "any threat of dictatorship or personal autocracy."

Meanwhile, extreme right-wing elements in Algeria continue to engage in rampant activities, putting pressure on the Paris government. De Gaulle's right-hand man, Soustelle of the Social Republican Party, has become the central figure in the riotous activities since arriving in Algiers on the 17th. On the 18th, he and Salan, Commander-in-Chief of the French colonial army in Algeria, spoke at a fascist demonstration, reiterating that Algeria could not be abandoned and that De Gaulle must come to power. In another city in Algeria, Philippeville, a fascist demonstration was also held on the 18th. Social Republican Party member of parliament, Thomasset, cheered on the rioters, saying that with Soustelle in Algeria and De Gaulle in Paris, all their hopes "will be realized."

In France itself, some well-known reactionary military figures have also come forward to support the Algerian riot groups. The head of the reactionary veterans' organization "Rhine and Danube," former French Chief of Staff, retired General Guillaume, visited French President Coty on the 18th, handing over the organization's resolution demanding that De Gaulle come to power. The resolution also expressed "full solidarity" with the colonialist-fascist elements in Algeria. At the same time, France's only Marshal, Juin, also wrote a letter to an Algerian veterans' organization expressing support for the riotous activities there.

France's new Minister of the Interior, Socialist Maurice Faure, delivered a radio address on the 18th, pointing out that "the fate of the Republic is in danger." He accused "irresponsible committees (referring to the 'Committees of Public Safety' organized by the Algerian rioters) of usurping (public) power. Some have risen up against the unity of the country, against the Republic." However, on the same day, the French government indicated that it did not intend to prohibit De Gaulle from holding a press conference. Minister of Information Gazier even stated that reporters would be allowed to freely report on De Gaulle's press conference. At the same time, the Ministry of the Interior under Faure's leadership ordered a ban on progressive organizations from holding anti-fascist demonstrations. The French government has deployed a large number of soldiers and police to implement a state of alert in Paris and has announced the mobilization of a portion of the gendarmerie reserve.

　　法共揭露戴高乐要在巴黎制造暴乱
    要求政府不向阴谋叛国分子让步
    法三大工会号召工人进行戒备并准备总罢工
    据新华社19日讯　巴黎消息：法国极右翼分子继续在阿尔及利亚和法国本土猖狂活动，企图造成政变形势，以便由戴高乐接管政权。全国民主力量正在紧急动员，准备给法西斯阴谋以大规模反击。
    戴高乐本人预定要在格林威治时间今天下午两点在巴黎法国国民议会附近的一家旅馆里举行四年来第一次记者招待会，他将在这次集会上以解释他在15日发表的关于准备执掌政权的声明为理由来进一步鼓吹由他登台执政的主张，以便公开动员国内支持他的殖民主义法西斯分子，加紧制造暴乱形势。
    法国共产党在昨天晚上发表的声明里揭露戴高乐的记者招待会“是要作为在首都动员阴谋叛国军队的一个借口”。共产党要求政府拒绝对阴谋叛国分子让步，并且解除叛乱将领的军事职务。“人道报星期刊”指出，戴高乐是反对共和国阴谋的中心，必须禁止他举行记者招待会。
    法国三个最大的工会法国总工会、“工人力量”总工会和天主教劳工联盟的领导人18日分别向所属各工会会员发出指示，要求工人们从19日中午起进入戒备状态，他们并且宣布必要时将号召举行保卫民主自由的总罢工。法国总工会领导的巴黎区工会联合会号召巴黎工人在格林威治时间今天下午两点戴高乐举行记者招待会的同时在各个工作场所举行集会，并且随时准备对法西斯示威的任何企图进行群众性的反击。代表二十四万会员的法国教师联合会也在同一天表示要在必要时举行总罢工来反对“任何独裁或个人专权的威胁”。
    同时，极右翼分子在阿尔及利亚继续大肆活动，对巴黎政府施加压力。戴高乐的左右手、社会共和党的苏斯戴尔在17日到达阿尔及尔以后已经成为暴乱活动的中心人物。他在18日和法国驻阿尔及利亚殖民军总司令萨兰在法西斯分子示威集会上讲话，再次叫嚷不能放弃阿尔及利亚并要戴高乐上台。在阿尔及利亚的另一个城市菲利普维尔，18日也举行了法西斯示威，社会共和党议员奥默赛为暴乱分子打气说：有苏斯戴尔在阿尔及利亚和戴高乐在巴黎，他们的一切希望“将会实现”。
    在法国本土，一些著名的反动军人也出头露面，支持阿尔及利亚的暴乱集团。反动退伍军人组织“莱因河和多瑙河”的首脑、前法国总参谋长、退伍将军纪尧姆18日访问了法国总统戈蒂，把这个组织要求让戴高乐上台的决议交给戈蒂，这个决议还表示“完全声援”在阿尔及利亚的殖民主义法西斯分子。同时，法国军队唯一的元帅许温也在写给阿尔及利亚一个退伍军人组织的信里表示支持那里的暴乱活动。
    法国新任内政部长、社会党人莫克18日发表广播演说，指出“共和国的命运处在危险中”。他指责“不负责任的委员会（指阿尔及利亚暴乱分子组织的“救国委员会”）篡夺了（公众的）权力。某些人已起来反对国家的统一、反对共和国”。但是，同一天，法国政府表明不打算禁止戴高乐举行记者招待会，宣传部长加齐埃并且表示将让记者们自由报道戴高乐记者招待会的情况。同时，莫克领导下的内政部却下令禁止进步组织举行反法西斯示威。法国政府已经调派大批军警在巴黎实行戒备，并且宣布动员一部分宪兵后备队。
