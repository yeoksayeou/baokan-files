Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 5th: The "People's Daily" published today a letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Executive Committee of the German Social Democratic Party. The letter calls on the German Social Democratic Party to more actively oppose the armament of the West German army with thermonuclear weapons, and suggests that it exchange views with the Communist Party of the Soviet Union on relevant issues in order to ease international tensions and defend world peace.

The CPSU Central Committee's letter stated that the decision of the West German Federal Parliament, not long ago, to arm the West German Bundeswehr with thermonuclear weapons, against the will of the majority of West German residents, is a serious step on the road to preparing for a devastating atomic war. It intensifies international relations and places the people of European countries in extremely dangerous circumstances. This decision has also created new and insurmountable obstacles to the restoration of German unification.

The CPSU Central Committee expressed its satisfaction with the German Social Democratic Party's opposition to arming the West German army with thermonuclear weapons and its advocacy of establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, and hoped that it would carry out more active activities to oppose the preparation for atomic war on German territory.

The CPSU Central Committee finally suggested that the German Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union exchange views in order to take effective measures to ease international tensions, prevent the outbreak of atomic war in Europe, and save mankind from the terrible consequences of atomic war.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 5th: At the invitation of the Free German Trade Union Federation, trade union delegations from twenty-six countries who came to the German Democratic Republic to attend the May Day celebrations issued a joint statement here, supporting, in the name of the trade unions they represent, the German working class's struggle against West German atomic armament and for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. The statement emphasized that if the power of the mighty working class unites and confronts the forces of militarism and monopoly capital, then the threat posed by arming the West German army with atomic weapons can be eliminated.

The trade union delegations from twenty-six countries expressed their heartfelt welcome to the Soviet Union's resolution to stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, and demanded that the United States and the United Kingdom also follow this example.

    苏共中央呼吁德国社会民主党
    共同努力阻止西德原子武装
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”今天发表了苏联共产党中央委员会给德国社会民主党执行委员会的一封信。这封信呼吁德国社会民主党更积极地反对以热核武器武装西德军队，并且建议它和苏联共产党就有关问题交换意见，以便缓和国际紧张局势，保卫世界和平。
    苏共中央的信说，西德联邦议院不久以前违背西德大多数居民的意志而通过的用热核武器武装西德国防军的决定，是在准备毁灭性原子战争道路上的一个严重步骤，它使得国际关系紧张起来，使欧洲各国人民处于极危险的境地。这个决定也为恢复德国统一造成了新的、难以克服的障碍。
    苏共中央对德国社会民主党反对以热核武器武装西德军队、主张建立中欧无原子武器地区的作法表示满意，并且希望它更积极地进行活动，反对在德国领土上准备原子战争。
    苏共中央最后建议德国社会民主党和苏联共产党交换意见，以便采取有效措施来缓和国际紧张局势，防止在欧洲发生原子战争和拯救人类免遭原子战争的可怕后果。
    新华社5日讯　据塔斯社柏林5日讯：应自由德国工会联合会的邀请，来德意志民主共和国参加五一节观礼的二十六个国家的工会代表团在这里发表一项联合声明，以他们所代表的工会的名义支持德国工人阶级反对西德原子武装，争取建立中欧无原子区的斗争。声明强调，如果强大的工人阶级的力量联合起来，一致对抗军国主义和垄断资本势力，那么用原子武器武装西德军队所造成的威胁是可以消除的。
    二十六个国家工会代表团表示衷心欢迎苏联关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的决议，并且要求美国和英国也效法这种榜样。
