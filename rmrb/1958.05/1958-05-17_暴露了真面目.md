    Exposed His True Colors
    De Gaulle has finally torn off his mask and openly declared his desire to be a dictator in France. In his statement on the 15th, he said: "Let the whole country know that I am ready to assume the power of the Republic."
    What capital does De Gaulle have to rely on? He boasted: "In the past, France, in its suffering, entrusted me to lead the whole country to the path of liberation."
    Indeed, as soon as the war ended, this general, who came out of Churchill's pocket, despicably stole the achievements of countless Communist Party members and resistance fighters in the anti-Nazi struggle, thus deceiving many people. However, deception cannot last long. More and more French people have gradually seen De Gaulle's true colors. In the 1953 municipal elections, his Rally of the French People suffered a crushing defeat, even forcing him to make a gesture of "retirement," is that not a good proof?
    Obviously, De Gaulle's current capital is only a portion of his influence among the senior generals in the army. Therefore, he wants to establish fascist rule in France.
    From starting as a self-proclaimed anti-fascist hero to revealing his hideous fascist face, De Gaulle's political path seems to be nothing more than this.

    暴露了真面目
    戴高乐终于自己撕破了假面具，公然宣布想在法国当独裁者了。他在15日发表的声明里说：“愿全国知道，我准备担负起共和国的权力。”
    戴高乐有什么资本作为凭借呢？他自我吹嘘说：“过去，法国在患难中曾信托我把全国整个地导向解救之路。”
    的确，战争刚一结束，这个从丘吉尔夹袋里跑出来的将军就卑鄙地把无数共产党员和抵抗战士的反纳粹斗争功绩窃为己有，因而也骗了不少人。但是，欺骗是不能长久的。越来越多的法国人民终于逐步看清了戴高乐的面目。1953年市政选举中，他的法兰西人民联盟一败涂地，甚至使他不得不作出“退隐”的姿态，难道不是一个很好的证明吗？
    很明显，戴高乐目前的资本，只是他在军队的高级将领中有一部分势力。因此，他就想在法国建立法西斯统治。
    从冒充反法西斯英雄起家，到露出法西斯的狰狞面目，戴高乐的政治道路看来不过如此而已。
