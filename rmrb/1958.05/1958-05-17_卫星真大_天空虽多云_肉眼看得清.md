Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th: At 19:44 (Beijing time) today, staff at the Zijinshan Observatory's Sheshan Observatory observed the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite with the naked eye. They saw the artificial earth satellite flying from north to south past the Big Dipper constellation for about one minute. Due to the cloudy sky, the observation of the position was not clear enough, but the new artificial satellite still appeared very bright.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 16th: At 21:28 (Beijing time) on the afternoon of the 16th, many cadres and citizens in Zhengzhou saw the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite intermittently flying from northwest to southwest with the naked eye.
