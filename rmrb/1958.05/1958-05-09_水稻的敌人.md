    Enemies of Rice
    In China, the main diseases and insect pests that harm rice include stem borers, rice leaf rollers, rice planthoppers, leafhoppers, rice gall midges, rice blast, and bacterial leaf blight, totaling no less than twenty species.
    Rice stem borers are the most ferocious enemies of rice. In areas with complex rice varieties and mixed planting of early, mid, and late-season rice, stem borer damage is most severe. In years with heavy infestation in these areas, rice production is often reduced by 20-30%. The main stem borers that harm rice are the yellow rice borer and the striped rice borer. The yellow rice borer occurs most frequently in the Yangtze River basin and rice-growing areas south of the Yangtze River, and is rarely found north of the Huai River. When rice is damaged by yellow rice borer larvae from the tillering stage to the booting stage, it withers and turns into "dead hearts"; when damaged during the heading stage, it becomes "whiteheads." The striped rice borer is found in almost all rice-growing areas of the country, and is also more severe in the southern rice-growing areas. Striped rice borer larvae initially harm the leaf sheaths, causing the affected leaf sheaths to turn withered and yellow. After the insects grow larger, they burrow into the rice stems to harm them, which can also cause "dead hearts." Some larvae burrow into the stems of booting rice, preventing the rice ears from emerging, forming "dead panicles." In addition, there is also a giant rice borer, which is also widespread, but the damage is not serious.
    The rice leaf roller is also one of the main pests in rice-producing areas, occurring to varying degrees in both the north and south. It generally occurs on a large scale every few years, and the affected areas generally experience a yield reduction of 20-30%. Rice planthoppers and leafhoppers are common in the south, and these two pests often occur simultaneously. Rice planthoppers harm early and mid-season rice, while leafhoppers harm late-season rice. Due to their rapid reproduction, they often cause huge disasters in a short period of time. Rice gall midges occur most severely in South China, and are more common in mountainous and semi-mountainous areas. Rice can be damaged throughout its entire growth process.
    Rice blast (rice fever) occurs in both northern and southern rice areas, with the northern rice areas being the most severely affected. In severely affected areas, there may even be no harvest. This disease is easily induced in cases of improper fertilization, such as excessive or late application, or uneven application. In recent years, it has also been severe in provinces such as Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Hubei. Bacterial leaf blight has occurred in Central China, East China, Fujian, Guangdong, and other provinces, and often causes significant losses.

### 水稻的敌人

    水稻的敌人
    我国为害水稻的主要病虫害有螟虫、稻苞虫、稻飞虱、浮尘子、稻瘿蝇、稻瘟病、白叶枯病等不下二十种。
    稻螟是水稻上最凶恶的敌人，在稻种复杂、早、中、晚稻混栽的地区，螟害最严重。这些地区受害重的年份，水稻常常减产二、三成。为害水稻的螟虫，主要是三化螟和二化螟。三化螟在长江流域和长江以南的稻区发生最多，淮河以北很少发现。水稻从发棵到孕穗之前被三化螟幼虫损害后，就枯萎变成“枯心”；在抽穗时期受害后，便成“白穗”。二化螟全国稻区差不多都有，也以南方稻区受害较重。二化螟幼虫起初在叶鞘里为害，使被害的叶鞘变为枯黄色；虫子长大以后钻入稻茎为害，也能造成“枯心”，有的幼虫钻进孕穗的茎内为害，稻穗就不能抽出，形成“枯孕穗”。另外还有一种大螟，发生也普遍，但为害不严重。
    稻苞虫也是水稻产区的主要害虫之一，南北都有不同程度的发生。一般每隔几年大发生一次，受害地区一般减产二—三成。稻飞虱和浮尘子在南方发生普遍，这两种害虫常同时发生。稻飞虱为害早、中稻，浮尘子为害晚稻，由于繁殖迅速，常在短期内酿成巨大灾害。稻瘿蝇以华南地区发生最重，以山区和半山区发生较多，水稻整个生长过程都可被害。
    稻瘟病（稻热病）在南北稻区都有发生，北方稻区受害最烈，被害严重的竟至颗粒无收。此病在施肥不适当的情况下，如过多或过晚、施得不匀等容易诱发。近几年在浙江、广东、湖北等省发生也较严重。稻白叶枯病在华中、华东、福建、广东等省均有发生，也常造成很大损失。
