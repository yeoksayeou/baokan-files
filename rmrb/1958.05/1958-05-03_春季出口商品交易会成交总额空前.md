Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 2nd: Since the 1958 Spring China Export Commodities Fair opened in Guangzhou on April 15th, the total transaction volume in half a month has reached over 187 million yuan (equivalent to over 27.39 million pounds), already breaking the highest record of transaction volume in previous fairs, and is more than four times the total transaction volume of the first China Export Commodities Fair held in Guangzhou last spring.

Due to the successful completion of China's First Five-Year Plan and the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, China's many export commodities have made significant progress in both quantity and quality. A total of twenty-nine regions submitted export goods for this fair. According to preliminary statistics, more than 2,700 new industrial products have been added, many of which China was previously unable to produce at all. Among chemical industrial products and pharmaceuticals, nearly 400 new export varieties have been added this time. Precision microtomes, which are still listed on the US so-called "embargo" list, are also being exported in large quantities this time. In the first half of the month's transactions, the transaction volume of industrial and mining products reached over 70 million yuan, accounting for 39.55% of the total transaction volume in half a month. Native products, special products, animal products, and handicrafts exported were welcomed by merchants from various countries due to their improved quality and specifications.

In this fair, China's foreign trade corporations also purchased some commodities that meet the needs of China's production. In the few days from April 22nd to 26th, relevant Chinese companies imported a batch of chemical industrial products and instruments, among other commodities.

Currently, trading activities at the China Export Commodities Fair are in full swing. According to relevant officials, a new trading climax is about to appear.

    春季出口商品交易会成交总额空前
    据新华社广州2日电  1958年春季中国出口商品交易会4月15日在广州举行以来，半月成交总额一亿八千七百多万元（折合英镑二千七百三十九万多镑），已经突破历届交易会成交总额的最高纪录，为去年春季在广州举办的第一届中国出口商品交易会成交总额的四倍以上。
    由于我国第一个五年计划胜利完成和全国工农业生产大跃进，我国许多出口商品在数量上和质量上都有很显著的进展。这次交易会共有二十九个地区提出了出口货源。据初步统计，新增加的工业品达两千七百多种，其中有许多是我国过去根本不能生产的。在化学工业产品及医药品中，这次新出口的品种就有近四百种。目前还列入美国所谓“禁运”清单的精密切片机，这次也大量外销。在这半个月的交易中，成交工矿产品即达七千万元以上，占到半月成交总额的39.55％。出口的土产品、特产品、畜产品和手工艺品，由于质量和规格提高，受到了各国商人的欢迎。
    在这次交易会中，我国各对外贸易公司还购进了一些符合我国生产上需要的商品。4月22日到26日的几天内，我国有关公司就进口了一批化学工业产品和仪器等商品。
    目前，中国出口商品交易会的交易活动正在频繁进行中，据有关负责人谈，一个新的交易高潮即将出现。
