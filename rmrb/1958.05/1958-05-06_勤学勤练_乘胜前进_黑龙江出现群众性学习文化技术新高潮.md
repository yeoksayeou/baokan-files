Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 5th: Heilongjiang Province, the first in our country to basically eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, has begun to see a new upsurge of mass learning of culture, science, and technology. Vocational schools and primary and secondary schools run by the masses are springing up like mushrooms after a rain throughout the province. The number of spare-time middle schools, spare-time primary schools, and various vocational middle schools run by the masses has reached more than 16,600. More than 830,000 young and middle-aged workers and farmers who have escaped illiteracy, as well as some graduates from higher primary schools, have entered these higher primary schools, junior middle schools, vocational middle schools, and even senior middle school spare-time schools to continue learning cultural and scientific and technological knowledge.

These schools run by the people take various forms, including agricultural middle schools that are half-work and half-study, spare-time middle schools and higher primary schools that hold classes in the evening, and more than 600 vocational middle schools specializing in agricultural mechanization, forestry, handicrafts, and other fields. Ning'an County, which was the first in the country to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy, had already piloted spare-time higher primary schools and spare-time middle schools in 1950 and 1954 respectively. Now, not only does the county have simple agricultural middle schools in every township, but also every commune has a middle school class, and every team has a higher primary school class. Harbin Normal University has also piloted a senior high school class in a township in Ning'an County.

Based on the experience accumulated over the past decade in making literacy work a regular practice, these spare-time schools in Heilongjiang Province have adopted a variety of learning organizations and learning forms. For example, agricultural middle schools are almost entirely in the form of half-work and half-study. Spare-time middle and primary schools that generally study in the evening adopt the method of "planting whatever during the day, learning whatever in the evening." In addition to cultural subjects such as language and mathematics, their curriculum includes production technology courses and socialist education courses, which improve both cultural knowledge and political and production technology levels. At the same time, in addition to classes for concentrated study, each school also utilizes learning classes and learning groups such as the guaranteed teaching and learning system, family groups, and kang-head groups that were adopted during literacy campaigns, to achieve the goal of "everyone learning and everyone improving" among young men and women. In terms of study time, the experience of literacy campaigns is also adopted: "Learn more when not busy, learn less when slightly busy, and maintain the basics when very busy." Many places stipulate the method of studying for one hour during spring plowing and weeding, forty minutes during summer weeding and autumn harvesting, and two hours during winter, so as to achieve "learning at night, practicing during the day, and continuing without interruption in spring, summer, autumn, and winter."

Regarding teachers and school funding, the masses are also relied upon to find solutions. Teachers are selected from cadres sent to lower levels, outstanding middle school graduates, older intellectuals in rural areas, or former literacy teachers. Funding is generally solved by the method of each school planting "cultural fields." Their slogan is: "Schools have cultural fields, don't ask the commune for money, not afraid of lacking lamps and oil, the masses running schools have great power."

    勤学勤练　乘胜前进
    黑龙江出现群众性学习文化技术新高潮
    新华社哈尔滨5日电　我国第一个基本上扫除了青壮年文盲的黑龙江省，开始出现群众性的学习文化科学技术的新高潮。全省各地群众兴办的职业学校和中、小学正像雨后春笋般出现。群众兴办的业余中学、业余小学和各种职业中学已达一万六千六百多所。已经有八十三万多脱离了文盲状态的青壮年工人、农民和一部分高小毕业生进入这些高小、初中、职业中学以至高中业余学校，继续学习文化和科学技术知识。
    这些民办学校的形式是各种各样的，有半工半读的农业中学，有晚间学习的业余中学和高小，还有六百多所农业机械化、林业、手工业等专业的职业中学。在全国完成扫除文盲任务最早的宁安县，早在1950年和1954年就分别试办了业余高小和业余中学，现在这个县不仅乡乡有简易农业中学，而且还作到了社社有中学班，队队有高小班。哈尔滨师范学院并在宁安县一个乡试办了高中班。
    根据过去十年积累的扫盲工作经常化的经验，黑龙江省兴办的这些业余学校采取了多种多样的学习组织和学习形式。比如农业中学，几乎全是半工半读的形式。一般夜间学习的业余中、小学，就采取白天种啥，晚上学啥的办法。他们的课程，除语文、数学等文化课外，各校都设有生产技术课和社会主义教育课，既提高文化，又提高政治和生产技术水平。同时，各校除有集中学习的班以外，还利用在扫盲时采取的包教保学、家庭小组和炕头组等学习班和学习小组等形式，以达到男女青壮年“人人都学习，个个都提高”的目的。在学习时间上也采取了扫盲的经验，“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙保本”。许多地方规定春耕和挂锄期间学习一小时，夏锄和秋收期间学习四十分钟，冬季学习两小时的办法，做到“黑天学，白天练，春夏秋冬不间断”。
    关于师资和办学经费，也是依靠群众想办法解决的。教师由下放干部、优秀的中学毕业生、农村中的年纪大的知识分子，或过去的扫盲教师担任；经费普遍采取每个学校都种“文化田”的办法解决。他们的口号是：“校有文化田，不向社要钱，缺灯少油全不怕，群众办学力量大”。
