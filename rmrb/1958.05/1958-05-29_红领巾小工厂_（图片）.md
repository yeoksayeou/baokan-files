    This little factory has 108 young workers, with two workshops for arts and crafts and service repairs, and also an attached Young Pioneer breeding team. Through the activities of the small "factory," the elementary school students have developed excellent habits of loving labor and loving the collective.

    “红领巾小工厂”
    天津市崇德里小学的学生们自己办起来的“红领巾小工厂”三年来已取得出色的成绩。
    这个小工厂有一百零八名小工人，设有工艺美术、服务修理两个车间，还附设了一个红领巾饲养队。小学生们通过小“工厂”的活动，已经养成了爱劳动、爱集体的优良习惯。同时给学习上也带来了良好的成绩。图为“红领巾工厂”的产品——编织书包、刺绣和用蛋壳做的金鱼。　新华社记者　梁一丁摄
