    "Waste" is Not Wasteful
    Whether an object is useful to people does not depend on the object itself, but on people. If you are not good at utilizing it, a useful object will become useless. If you are good at utilizing it, a useless object will become useful. The vivid facts of how the masses in Xinhui County, Guangdong, have utilized waste in recent years have made this principle even clearer.
    Waste utilization is a part of man's transformation of nature. The creative potential of people in this struggle to transform nature can only be most fully realized under our socialist system.
    The problem now is: to do ideological liberation work like Xinhui County, follow the mass line, and break people's rigid ideas about "waste." Let everyone understand this dialectical law: "waste" can not only be transformed into useful things, but also be transformed from small use to big use, from one use to multiple uses; thereby everyone should use their hands and brains to collect waste and transform waste. The infinite wisdom of the masses can create everything, and can also make "waste" not wasteful.

### “废物”不废

    “废物”不废
    物对人有用无用，不决定于物本身，而决定于人。不善于利用，有用之物也会无用，善于利用，无用之物就会变成有用。广东新会县群众几年来利用废物的生动事实，使这个道理变得更加明白了。
    废物利用是人改造自然的一部分，人在改造自然这个斗争中的创造潜力，只有在我们这个社会主义制度下，才有可能得到最充分的发挥。
    现在的问题是：要像新会县那样，做思想解放工作，走群众路线，打破人们对待“废物”的僵化观念。让大家懂得这个辩论规律：“废物”不但可变为有用之物，还能小用变大用，一用变多用；从而人人动手、动脑，搜集废物、改造废物。群众的无穷智慧能够创造一切，也就能够使“废物”不废。
