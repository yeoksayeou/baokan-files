　　"Science for science's sake" is a bourgeois deception of the people. Science comes from the practice of the struggle for production and class struggle, and serves the struggle for production and class struggle. Countless historical facts have proven this truth.
　　The various research institutes in the Shanghai area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have launched a major debate on whether scientific research must serve the great leap in production. And it was initially clarified that: production practice is the source of theory, and also the touchstone of theory. To develop theory away from production practice is to put the cart before the horse. This debate is very necessary, and the initial clarified thinking is correct. We welcome scientific workers to break down bourgeois viewpoints in their thinking and break down academic research in the great leap forward of the motherland's construction of socialism, to throw themselves into the practice of the great construction cause, accelerate the development of science and technology, and enable our country's scientific level to catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible.
　　Of course, scientific research can directly serve production, and it can also indirectly serve production. We cannot force uniformity; but in basic viewpoints, we must be consistent, that is, scientific research must serve production practice, and scientific workers must reform their bourgeois individualistic thinking and wholeheartedly serve the socialist construction of the motherland! The motherland's technological revolution and cultural revolution are beginning, and we expect scientific research workers to quickly walk out of the academy, break the superstition that scientific theory is profound and mysterious, and transform the bourgeois concept of "science for science's sake" into scientific practice that combines scientific research with production and serves socialist construction.

    打破学院式的研究
    “为科学而科学”是资产阶级欺骗人民的说法。科学是从生产斗争和阶级斗争的实践中来，又为生产斗争和阶级斗争服务的。历史上无数事实已经证明了这一真理。
    中国科学院上海地区各研究所就科学研究是否必须为生产大跃进服务等问题展开大辩论。并且初步明确了：生产实践是理论的源泉，又是理论的试金石，离开生产实践去发展理论，这是本末倒置。这一辩论是非常必要的，初步明确的思想是正确的。我们欢迎科学工作者在祖国建设社会主义的大跃进中，能够打破思想上的资产阶级观点，打破学院式的研究，投入伟大的建设事业的实践中来，加速科学技术的发展，使我国的科学水平提早赶上世界先进水平。
    当然，科学研究，有直接为生产服务的，也有间接为生产服务的，不能强求一律；但在基本观点上，必须一致，那就是科学研究必须为生产实践服务，科学工作者必须革掉资产阶级个人主义思想，全心全意为祖国的社会主义建设服务！祖国的技术革命和文化革命正在开始，期待着科学研究工作者迅速走出学院，打破科学理论是深奥神秘的迷信，把“为科学而科学”的资产阶级的观念变成科学研究结合生产，为社会主义建设服务的科学实践。
