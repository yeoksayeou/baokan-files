Serving the Peasants, Being Both Red and Expert
Xiehe Medical Workers Go to the Countryside

    (Our Newspaper) Beijing, China News Agency – More than thirty medical workers from Beijing Xiehe Hospital, affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, who were sent to the Nanyuan suburban area of ​​Beijing, have gained great ideological and professional benefits after nearly two months of basic-level health work.

    These dispatched medical workers are scattered in district hospitals, state-owned farms, and medical clinics in various townships. From the first day of their assignment, they wholeheartedly began to serve the peasant masses. They are full of enthusiasm and confidence in the new job requirements. In the past, due to the limitations of medical technology in the suburbs, many diseases of the peasants could not be treated in time. For example, patients with heart failure, lung abscess, etc., did not receive accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment for a long time, and some even died as a result. A patient with bilateral lung abscess, whose condition had developed to a very dangerous level, was diagnosed by several dispatched doctors and rescued with great efforts, and has been saved from danger. Xie, an old lady from the Hongxing Agricultural Production Cooperative, had a four-year-old child with appendicitis. When the dispatched doctors discovered it, it was already the fourth day. After emergency surgery and rescue, the child was finally saved. There are also many patients who have not been diagnosed for a long time and have begun to get rid of the torment of the disease after active treatment by the dispatched doctors. A worker on the farm suffered from renal tuberculosis for more than two years and had not been diagnosed. He was cured after being discovered by the dispatched doctors and undergoing surgery.

    On the farm's water conservancy construction site, the dispatched medical workers carried medicine boxes to every work area regardless of the weather, so that minor illnesses and injuries could be treated in time. When people were digging wells too vigorously, many people had cracked hands at the beginning. After they promptly put forward preventive measures, the rate of cracking was greatly reduced. In Xiehe Hospital, due to the influence of bourgeois ideology, many doctors only liked patients with "research value" and were not interested in patients who were not conducive to "improving technology." This is completely different from the performance of the dispatched doctors on the construction site today. One doctor said: "Once you get to the construction site, the people's fervent energy simply makes it impossible for our minds to be calm for a moment. In this case, who can care about personal gains and losses? That would be too shameful."

    These dispatched medical workers were originally in Xiehe. Because the departments were finely divided, they were only good at one specialty. Once they went to the suburbs, they were required to be proficient in all kinds of martial arts in the case of decentralized and independent work. This is of course very difficult. Faced with this difficulty, they came up with many active ways to overcome the difficulties. When someone encounters a problem that cannot be solved by their own specialty, they take the initiative to consult other doctors by telephone. Sometimes, if the consultation is too late, they immediately consult books. Some doctors were still reading the treatment plan in the books on the way to the consultation. If consulting books and telephone consultations still cannot solve the problem, they will return to Xiehe or consult experts by telephone, or simply invite the experts out of the city to guide them. Professor Zeng Xianjiu, director of surgery at Xiehe, and Professor Zhang Xuede, an expert in internal infectious diseases, have both gone to Nanyuan Hospital to guide surgery and help prevent and treat diseases.

    The dispatched doctors deeply realized in their work that many treatments and surgeries used in the city are not applicable or not fully applicable in rural areas. Therefore, applying the city's set of methods to the countryside is still an arduous process of exploration and research. For example, for patients with roundworms entering the bile duct, it is only necessary to perform surgery to remove them in the city. But this is not possible in rural areas, because the cost of surgery is relatively high, and the equipment required for surgery is also relatively high, which is not easy to promote, and there are currently many roundworms in rural areas. Even if the surgery is performed this time, they may still enter in the near future. The dispatched doctors have tried a non-surgical treatment method for such patients, forcing the roundworms to come out of the bile duct, and have achieved initial success.

    The hard work of these dispatched medical workers has won the trust and praise of the local people. Some big-character posters praised their work attitude for catching up with "Tianqiao". A farmer specially wrote a allegro to express praise: Gale and sand fill the sky, they go to the well rack again (referring to the well-digging site), and then they hear a loud shout, "Which comrade is sick, which comrade is injured?" After the illness and injury are just seen, they also say, how to protect well, and talk about common sense of disease prevention. The farmers are all healthy, and the farm's development is far and wide. (Xiong Shiqi)

### 为农民服务　为又红又专  协和医务工作者下乡

    为农民服务　为又红又专
    协和医务工作者下乡
    本报讯　中国医学科学院所属北京协和医院下放到北京市南苑郊区的三十多个医务工作者，经过将近两个月的基层卫生工作锻炼，在思想上和工作上都取得了很大收获。
    这些下放的医务工作者分散在区医院、国营农场和各个乡的医疗门诊部。从下放的第一天起，他们就全心全意地开始为农民群众服务。他们对新的工作要求，充满了热情和信心。过去，因为郊区医疗技术条件的限制，农民中有不少疾病不能及时治疗。如心力衰竭、肺脓肿等患者，长时间没有得到确切的诊断和适当治疗，甚至因而有造成死亡的。一个两肺脓肿患者，病情已经发展到十分危险的程度，经几位下放医师确诊后大力挽救，已经转危为安。红星农业生产合作社谢老大娘一个四岁的小孩患阑尾炎，当下放医师发现已是第四天了，经紧急手术抢救，终于使这个小孩脱险。还有不少长期没有得到确诊的患者经过下放医师的积极治疗开始摆脱病魔的纠缠。农场一位工人患肾结核已经二年多，一直没有得到确诊，经下放医师发现并施行手术后，痊愈了。
    在农场的水利工地上，下放的医务工作者们不论什么天气都背着药箱深入到每一个工区，使轻微的病伤得到及时救治。人们打井时干劲太猛，开始时有不少人手上有震裂现象，经他们及时提出预防措施，大大减少了裂伤率。在协和医院，因为资产阶级思想的影响，不少医师只喜欢有“研究价值”的病人，对不利于“提高技术”的患者是不感兴趣的。这和下放医师今天在工地上的表现对比一下，完全不同了。一位医师说：“一到工地，人们那股子火热干劲，简直使我们的脑子没有办法平静片刻，在这种情况下谁还能顾着去考虑个人的得失呢？那太可耻了”。
    这批下放的医务工作者们原在协和，因为各科分工细，都只是长于某一种专科，一到郊区，在需要分散、独立进行工作的情况下，要求每一个医师都通晓十八般武艺，这当然是很大的困难。在这个困难面前，他们想出了很多积极的办法来克服困难。当谁碰到不是自己的专长所能解决的问题，谁就主动同其他医师电话会诊，有时会诊来不及就马上请教书本。有的医师在出诊的路上还在翻阅着书本上的处理方案。如果请教书本和电话会诊仍然不能解决问题，他们就回协和或电话请教专家或者干脆把专家请出城来指导。协和外科主任曾宪九教授、内科传染病学专家张学德教授等，都曾经先后到南苑医院指导手术和帮助防治疾病。
    下放医师在工作中都深切体会到在城市使用的很多治疗法和手术，在农村并不适用或不完全适用。因而要把城市的一套用于农村还是一个艰苦的摸索和研究过程。如回虫钻入胆管患者，在城内只要施行手术取出即可。但在农村就不行，因为手术费用较高，手术所要求的设备条件也较高，不便于推广，而且目前农村回虫很多，即使这次手术取出，不久仍有可能钻入。下放医师就对这类患者试行一种不施行手术的治疗方法，迫使回虫从胆管出来，已初步取得成功。
    这批下放的医务工作者的辛勤工作，获得当地人民的信任和赞扬。有的大字报称赞他们的工作态度赶上了“天桥”。一个农民专门编写了一首表扬的快板：狂风飞砂满天，他们又到井架边（指打井工地），随着就听到高声喊，“那位同志得了病，那位同志受工伤？”病伤刚看完，他们又把话言，如何保护好，防病常识讲一番。农民身体个个健，农场发展远无边。　（熊世琦）
