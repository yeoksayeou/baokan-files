    Four Key Aspects of Building a New Communist University
    Jiang Longji's Report at Peking University's Anniversary Celebration

    (Our Dispatch) Jiang Longji, Second Secretary of the Peking University Party Committee and Vice President of Peking University, delivered a report to the entire faculty and students entitled "Erect the Proletarian, Destroy the Bourgeois, Be Both Red and Expert, and Strive to Build a New Communist Peking University" to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the university.

    The report analyzed and summarized the main problems exposed in the "Double-Anti" movement, pointing out the four key aspects that must be grasped tightly in the future to build a new communist Peking University: First, implement the class line and conscientiously implement the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants; second, intensify ideological remolding and make a great leap forward towards the goal of being both red and expert; third, implement the principle of linking theory with practice to improve the quality of teaching; and fourth, strengthen the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism and launch a struggle against bourgeois academic thought.

    Regarding the issue of the school implementing the class line and opening its doors to workers and peasants, Jiang Longji said that Peking University has taken a series of measures in the years since liberation to implement the policy of opening the door to workers and peasants. The proportion of worker and peasant students among the new students admitted each year has increased year by year. Currently, worker and peasant students account for 19.5% of the total student population. This proportion is still small, but more seriously, the dropout rate for worker and peasant students after entering the school is very high. The main reason is that most of the school's teachers come from exploiting class families and have been educated in the bourgeois system for a long time. They are fundamentally incompatible with the working class and peasant masses in terms of class sentiment. They believe that "workers are crude and peasants are muddy-legged, their minds are not quick, they are born without talent, they have no innate conditions, and they are not fit to learn foreign languages." In addition, the admission work and the admission system also have a view of emphasizing talent over morality. The political review of new students is not strict, and the requirements for professional skills are too high, fearing that admitting too many worker and peasant students will lower the level of the university. In the future, the work of recruiting new students should be carried out in accordance with the principle of giving equal importance to morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, and more workers and peasants should be admitted to the school. When talking about intensifying ideological remolding and making a great leap forward towards the goal of being both red and expert, Jiang Longji first analyzed many erroneous views that appeared in the debate on being "red" and "expert." Such as the so-called "division of labor between red and expert," "stages of red and expert," "red is easy, expert is difficult," "red is not as good as expert," "more expert, less red," "red and expert are mutually exclusive," "red is the means, expert is the end"... In summary, it is nothing more than being only expert and not red or a "pink road." The "pink road" is essentially a disguise for the road of being only expert and not red. These are basically all due to the pernicious influence of bourgeois individualism.

    Jiang Longji said: "We believe that true redness requires the standpoint of the working class, a communist worldview, and the ability to wholeheartedly serve socialism. Being an expert means mastering the theoretical and practical knowledge of one's major and being able to use the scientific theory and technology of one's major to solve specific problems in practical work. The so-called 'both red and expert' refers to having a communist worldview and outlook on life, being able to use the theory and methods of Marxism-Leninism to engage in learning, guide teaching and scientific research, and completely contribute the results of the work to socialist construction, wholeheartedly serving the working people. Red and expert are unified and indivisible. Red, that is, politics, is the commander and soul of all undertakings; expert, that is, professional skills, is a tool and weapon for serving the people. The two must be closely combined to maximize their effectiveness. Being both red and expert, red to the core and expert to the depths, embodies the requirements of the proletariat for training cadres and is the standard of moral and intellectual qualities that working-class intellectuals must possess. Bourgeois individualism is the biggest obstacle on the road to being both red and expert. It is an ideological system that is opposed to the collectivist ideology of the working class. Without removing this stumbling block, being both red and expert, red to the core and expert to the depths, is absolutely impossible.

    Jiang Longji pointed out the source of the intellectuals' bourgeois individualism and said: The faculty and students of Peking University basically belong to the category of bourgeois intellectuals. Although they have made considerable progress under the education and help of the Party since liberation, due to the fact that the bourgeois standpoint has not been completely abandoned and a communist outlook on life has not been established, bourgeois individualism exists universally and seriously. Specifically, many teachers proceed from personal fame and gain and personal interests, and carry out teaching and scientific research work according to bourgeois educational ideas and academic thoughts. Under the influence of the teachers' ideas of fame and gain, many students have also embarked on the road of "only expert and not red." "Turning a deaf ear to what is happening outside the window and concentrating solely on studying professional books." Whether in choosing a major, selecting courses, extracurricular reading, or selecting topics for theses, they are considering personal interests, personal fame and gain, and how to become famous and successful in the future. For example, a graduate student in the Chinese Department even took "There is always a way to reach the blue sky, and I vow not to rest until I am known to the world" as his motto, and "Ten years of studying hard and no one asks, one success and the world knows" as his belief. In Peking University, the question of who will win between the socialist and capitalist roads has not been completely resolved, and we must use our greatest strength to solve this problem. The key to solving the problem lies in intensifying self-remolding, eliminating all bourgeois individualistic ideas, and establishing the collectivist ideas of the working class.

    When talking about implementing the principle of linking theory with practice to improve the quality of teaching and scientific research, Jiang Longji said: Linking theory with practice is the basic principle of our teaching work and the basic policy of our scientific research work. After several years of teaching reform, although we have achieved great results in implementing this policy and reforming our teaching and scientific research work, some of our students and even teachers still have many confused views on this issue, and the phenomenon of separation of theory from practice and disconnection between learning and application left over from the old universities has not been completely eradicated.

    Jiang Longji said: The most fundamental source of knowledge is the practice of production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experimentation, but some people believe that knowledge comes from abstract thinking. They mistakenly equate book knowledge and theory completely, and at the same time put this "theory" in a supreme position. In the various departments of social sciences, this is mainly manifested in the fact that many teachers and students are far more interested in ready-made principles in books than in practice. They only read books behind closed doors and are unwilling to conduct investigations and field studies. They believe that teaching is the trafficking of book knowledge, and scientific research is the piecing together of articles from existing books and documents. It is no wonder that the papers they write and the courses they teach only contain some abstract and empty principles, lacking new insights and lacking vivid practical content. In addition, influenced by Hu Shi's experimentalism, there is also a tendency to despise Marxist-Leninist theory in various departments of social sciences. Therefore, many teachers only pay attention to textual research of historical materials and do not attach importance to theory, and even regard historical materials and textual research themselves as "theory."

    Jiang Longji pointed out that in order to further implement the principle of linking theory with practice, teaching and scientific research work must be closely linked to the actual situation of current socialist construction and serve socialist construction. In the various departments of natural sciences, we should serve economic construction and production construction. We should attach importance to the exploration and research of basic theories that are closely related to scientific development and the long-term construction of the country. In the various departments of social sciences, the most important thing is to emphasize the present and belittle the past, and correct the tendency of emphasizing the past and belittling the present. We must link with the reality of class struggle and ideological struggle, and implement the spirit of socialist ideological education in teaching, so that the students trained all have a high degree of socialist consciousness.

    Regarding strengthening the guiding role of Marxism-Leninism and launching a struggle against bourgeois academic thought, Jiang Longji pointed out that Marxism-Leninism is the worldview and methodology of the working class and the doctrine of socialist revolution and socialist construction. Whether one recognizes the guiding role of Marxism or not is one of the important criteria for recognizing or not recognizing the leadership of the working class and for approving or disapproving of the socialist system. A small number of people in the school still adopt a negative or skeptical attitude towards Marxism-Leninism. They always feel that Marxism does not suit their tastes and try every means to revise it. In teaching and scientific research, they consciously or unconsciously peddled many anti-Marxist or non-Marxist views and spread a lot of bourgeois ideological toxins. During the rectification movement, the facts in this regard that the masses revealed in large-character posters were shocking. For example, some philosophy teachers openly defended idealism in the classroom, saying that "idealism as idealism is not necessarily wrong." A civil law professor explained fixed interest as "creditor-debtor relationship." A criminal law teacher mistakenly believed that "now that the contradictions among the people have increased, the focus of criminal law will inevitably shift to the inside of the people." A history professor promoted bourgeois methods of scholarship to students, saying: "There are four keys to studying history, namely, chronology, geography, official positions, and catalogs," but he did not mention the Marxist historical viewpoint. These arguments show how seriously our teaching content violates Marxist principles.

    Jiang Longji talked about the reasons why Peking University did not receive good results when it opened some idealistic courses in implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, saying: "There is nothing wrong with opening idealistic courses, and we will continue to do so in the future, but it is not right to give lectures in an objectivist and uncritical way as we did in the past. In the past two years, the philosophy department has offered special lectures on Hegel, Russell, and Kant, but historical materialism has been slow to open. As for the monographs of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, except for Lenin's Philosophical Notes opened by Soviet experts, they have not been lectured as special topics (they were only lectured in the history of Marxist-Leninist philosophy), and the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, which have great practical significance for the development of Marxism in China, have not been lectured by anyone. This has made idealism and materialism not distinct in terms of importance, but turned the guest into the host; not clear-cut, but confused black and white. Obviously, this is not entirely in line with the spirit of 'letting a hundred flowers bloom.' In the future, in continuing to implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom, we must launch a critique of bourgeois academic thought. Without destruction, there can be no construction. If we do not fight dozens of rounds against bourgeois academic thought, the leading position of Marxism cannot be consolidated. In the past few years, we have fought some battles against bourgeois academic thought and achieved some victories. But generally speaking, we have not done enough. Some teachers only criticize the ancients, not the present; only criticize foreigners, not Chinese; only criticize the dead, not the living. Some teachers have always held a negative attitude in the struggle of academic thought. We must pay attention to reversing this situation.

    When talking about arming ourselves to strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, Jiang Longji criticized several incorrect learning attitudes and methods. He said: Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action. To study every principle of Marxism, we must connect it with our own thoughts, our own work, and the reality of revolution and construction. We must transform the principles of Marxism into vivid and lively things with flesh and blood through ideological struggle and life practice; we must use Marxism as a weapon to first transform our own subjective world, and then use it to transform the objective world. He also said: Strengthening the study of Marxism-Leninism must carry out the struggle between two lines, opposing dogmatism on the one hand and revisionism on the other. Institutions of higher learning with a large number of intellectuals are a hotbed of revisionism, and we must be especially vigilant and pay attention to fighting against it.

    Jiang Longji finally pointed out that the "Double-Anti" movement in the past two months has made a leap forward in the thinking of most of the faculty and students, which has laid the foundation for the leap forward of the entire school's work. He hoped that all teachers and students would continue to work hard and strive to realize the new communist Peking University.

    建设共产主义新大学的四个环节
    江隆基在北大校庆时作了报告
    本报讯　中共北京大学党委第二书记、北京大学副校长江隆基以“兴无灭资、红透专深、为建设共产主义新北京大学而奋斗”为题，向全校师生作了纪念校庆六十周年的报告。
    这个报告分析总结了双反运动中所暴露出来的主要问题，指出了今后为建设一个共产主义的新北京大学而奋斗必须紧紧抓住的四个环节：第一，贯彻阶级路线，认真实行向工农开门的方针；第二，加紧思想改造，向又红又专的目标大跃进；第三，贯彻执行理论联系实际的方针，提高教学的质量；第四，加强马克思列宁主义的指导作用，展开对资产阶级学术思想的斗争。
    关于学校贯彻阶级路线向工农开门的问题，江隆基说，北京大学在解放后这几年里采取过一系列措施贯彻向工农开门的方针，每年入学的新生中工农学生所占的比例逐年有所增加，现全校工农学生占全体学生总数19.5％，这个比例还小，但更严重的是工农学生进校后淘汰率很大，主要原因是学校的教师多数出身于剥削阶级家庭，长期受资产阶级的教育，在阶级感情上和工农群众总格格不入。他们认为“工人是大老粗，农民是泥腿子，脑子不灵敏，生来无天才，先天无条件，不配学洋文”。而在招生工作和招生制度上也存在着重才轻德的观点，对新生政治审查不严，业务要求过高，怕把工农学生取多了会降低大学的水平。今后应该根据德、才、体并重的原则来进行招收新生的工作，吸收更多的工农入学。在谈到加紧思想改造，向又红又专目标大跃进时，江隆基先分析了在红专问题辩论中所出现的许多错误看法。如所谓“红专分工论”、“红专分段论”、“红易专难论”、“红不如专论”、“多专少红论”、“红专不可兼得论”、“红是手段专是目的论”……。归结起来无非是只专不红或“粉红色的道路”。而“粉红色的道路”实质上也是只专不红道路的伪装。这些基本上都是由于资产阶级个人主义思想作祟。
    江隆基说：“我们认为真正的红是要有工人阶级的立场，共产主义的世界观，并能全心全意为社会主义服务。专，就是要掌握本专业的理论知识和实际知识，并能运用本专业的科学理论和技术去解决实际工作中的具体问题。所谓“又红又专”就是指具有共产主义的世界观和人生观，能运用马克思列宁主义的理论和方法去从事学习、指导教学和科学研究，而且把工作的成果完全贡献给社会主义事业，全心全意为劳动人民服务。红与专两者是统一不可分割的，红即政治，它是一切事业的统帅和灵魂，专即业务，它是为人民服务的工具和武器，两者必须密切结合，才能发挥最大的作用。又红又专、红透专深，体现了无产阶级培养干部的要求，是工人阶级知识分子必须具备的德才标准。而资产阶级个人主义是又红又专道路上的最大障碍，它是和工人阶级集体主义思想相对立的思想体系，不搬掉这个绊脚石，又红又专、红透专深就绝对办不到。
    江隆基指出了知识分子的资产阶级个人主义思想的来源后说：北大的师生基本上是属于资产阶级知识分子的范畴，解放以来在党的教育帮助下虽有不少进步，但由于资产阶级的立场还未完全抛弃，共产主义的人生观没有建立起来，因此资产阶级个人主义思想普遍严重地存在着。具体表现在很多教师是从个人名利、个人兴趣出发，根据资产阶级的教育思想和学术思想进行教学和科学研究工作。在教师们的名利思想影响下，不少学生也走上了“只专不红”的道路。“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读业务书”。无论在分专业、选课、课外阅读或论文选题上，考虑的都是个人兴趣，个人名利，将来如何成名成家。如中文系有个研究生竟以“青霄有路终须上，宇宙无闻誓不休”为座右铭，“十年寒窗无人问，一举成名天下知”为信条。在北京大学里社会主义和资本主义两条道路谁战胜谁的问题，还没有得到彻底的解决，我们必须用最大的力量来解决这个问题。解决问题的关键在于加紧自我改造，清除一切资产阶级个人主义的思想，树立工人阶级集体主义的思想。
    在谈到贯彻执行理论联系实际的方针提高教学和科学研究的质量这个问题时，江隆基说：理论联系实际是我们教学工作的基本原则，也是我们科学研究工作的基本方针。经过几年来的教学改革，我们在贯彻这个方针，改革我们的教学和科学研究工作上，虽然已经获得了很大的成绩，然而直到现在为止，我们有些学生以至教师在这个问题上还存在着不少糊涂观点，旧大学遗留下来的理论与实际分家、学与用脱节的现象还没有能够完全根绝。
    江隆基说：知识的最根本的源泉是生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验的实践，但有些人则认为知识来源于抽象的思维，他们错误地把书本知识和理论完全等同起来，同时又把这种“理论”放在至高无上的地位，这在社会科学各系主要表现在不少教师和学生对于书本现成原理的兴趣，大大超过对于实际的兴趣，他们只闭门读书，不愿进行调查研究和实地考察。他们认为教学就是书本知识的贩运，科学研究就是从现成书籍和文献中东拼西凑写成文章，这就无怪乎他们所写的论文和所教的课，只有一些抽象空洞的原理，缺乏新的见解，缺乏生动的实际内容了。另外，在社会科学各系因受胡适实验主义的影响，也存在着轻视马列主义理论的趋向，因而许多教师只注意考据史料，不重视理论，甚至把史料、考据本身就当做“理论”。
    江隆基指出，要进一步贯彻理论联系实际的方针，就必须使教学和科学研究工作密切联系当前社会主义建设的实际，为社会主义建设服务。在自然科学各系应为经济建设和生产建设服务。重视同科学发展、国家长远建设有密切关系的基本理论的探索和研究。在社会科学各系最重要的是要厚今薄古，纠正厚古薄今的偏向。要联系阶级斗争和思想斗争的实际，要在教学中贯彻社会主义思想教育的精神，使培养出来的学生都具有高度的社会主义觉悟。
    关于加强马克思列宁主义的指导作用，展开对资产阶级学术思想的斗争，江隆基指出，马克思列宁主义是工人阶级的世界观和方法论，是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的学说。承认不承认马克思主义的指导作用，就是承认不承认工人阶级的领导和赞成不赞成社会主义制度的重要标准之一。学校还有一少部分人至今对于马克思列宁主义采取了否定或怀疑的态度。他们总觉得马克思主义不合他们的胃口，千方百计地要给它加以修正。他们在教学和科学研究中自觉不自觉地贩运了许多反马克思主义或非马克思主义的观点，散布了不少资产阶级思想毒素。整风运动中，群众在大字报上大量揭发的这方面事实是令人吃惊的。例如有的哲学教员在课堂上公开为唯心主义辩护，说“唯心论作为唯心论，不一定错误”。民法教授把定息解释成为“债权关系”。刑法教师错误地认为“现在人民内部的矛盾增多了，刑法的锋芒势必转向人民内部了”。历史教授向学生宣传资产阶级的治学方法，说：“研究历史有四把钥匙，即年代，地理，官职，目录”，唯独不提马克思主义的历史观点。这些论点，说明我们的教学内容之违反马克思主义原则已经到多么严重的程度。
    江隆基谈到了北京大学在贯彻百家争鸣政策中开设了某些唯心主义的课程而没有收到好的效果的原因时说：“开设唯心主义的课程，这件事并没有错，今后还要这样做，但过去那样客观主义的不加批判的讲，是不对的。哲学系近两年来开过黑格尔、罗素和康德的专题讲授，而历史唯物主义却迟迟不能开出，至于马、恩、列、斯的专著，除苏联专家所开“列宁的哲学笔记”外，没有作为专题去讲授（只是在马列主义哲学史中讲过），而作为马克思主义在中国之发展具有重大现实意义的毛泽东同志的著作，更无人讲授。这就使得唯心论与唯物论不是宾主有别，而是喧宾夺主；不是黑白分明，而是皂白不分。显然，这和“百家争鸣”的精神是不完全符合的。今后在继续贯彻执行百家争鸣方针中，必须展开对资产阶级学术思想的批判。不破不立，不和资产阶级学术思想大战几十个回合，马克思主义的领导地位是巩固不了的。在过去几年内，我们和资产阶级学术思想进行过一些斗争，也取得了一些胜利。但是总的说来，做得还很不够。有的教师只批评古人，不批评今人；只批评外国人，不批评中国人；只批评死人，不批评活人。有的教师则在学术思想斗争中一直抱着消极的态度。我们必须注意扭转这种局势。
    在谈到武装自己加强马克思列宁主义的学习时，江隆基批判了几种不正确的学习态度和学习方法。他说：马克思主义不是教条，而是行动的指南。学习马克思主义的每一条原理，都必须联系自己的思想，联系自己的工作，联系革命和建设的实际。要把马克思主义的原理和原则，通过思想斗争和生活实践，变成有血有肉的生动活泼的东西；要把马克思主义当作武器，首先改造自己的主观世界，然后再用它去改造客观世界。他又说：加强马克思列宁主义的学习必须进行两条路线的斗争，一方面反对教条主义，另一方面要反对修正主义。知识分子成堆的高等学校，是修正主义的温床，特别要警惕注意和它斗争。
    江隆基最后指出，两个月来的双反运动在大多数的师生中间，思想上都向前跃进了一步，这为全校整个工作的跃进打下了基础。他希望全体师生再接再厉的前进，为实现共产主义的新北京大学而奋斗。
