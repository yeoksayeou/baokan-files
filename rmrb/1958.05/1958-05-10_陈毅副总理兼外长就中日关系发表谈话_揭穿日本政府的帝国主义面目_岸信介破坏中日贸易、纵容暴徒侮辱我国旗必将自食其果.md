Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi met with Xinhua News Agency reporters on May 9th and issued a statement on the current Sino-Japanese relations.

    In his statement, Vice Premier Chen Yi emphasized that recently, Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, in order to please the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly sabotaged the Sino-Japanese trade agreement and launched malicious and insulting attacks against China. The Chinese people cannot but feel extremely indignant at this provocative behavior. Vice Premier Chen Yi specifically cited the incident in which the Kishi Nobusuke government connived at thugs insulting the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki, which shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China has reached an intolerable point.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: The Chinese people are willing to live in friendship with the Japanese people and have always strived to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, despite the Japanese government's submission to the will of the United States, and despite the fact that the state of war between the two countries has not ended, the two peoples, through continuous efforts, have still greatly developed economic, cultural, and friendly ties between the two countries in recent years. More than 40 agreements have been signed between non-governmental and semi-official organizations of the two countries, which have played a significant role in promoting friendly relations between the two peoples. The Chinese government has consistently given active support to the friendly activities and non-governmental agreements between the people of China and Japan. This attitude of ours has been welcomed by the broad masses of the Japanese people. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government is the opposite. It has always held a hostile rather than benevolent attitude towards our country, and mistakenly regarded China's goodwill as a sign of weakness and vulnerability. On the one hand, Kishi Nobusuke expressed his intention to expand Sino-Japanese trade in order to obtain economic benefits from China, but on the other hand, he rudely sabotaged the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, condoned thugs in Nagasaki insulting the Chinese national flag, and personally took the lead in publishing lengthy slanders and attacks against China. Kishi Nobusuke's arrogant attitude thoroughly exposed his hidden imperialist face.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that in the past, the Japanese government's dealing with China in an imperialist manner had already suffered a heavy blow from the Chinese people, and it was finally declared a complete bankruptcy. Today, the Chinese people have stood up. It is not only even more impossible for the Kishi Nobusuke government to deal with China in an imperialist manner, but it will inevitably be lifting a stone only to drop it on its own feet.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi emphatically refuted Kishi Nobusuke's various absurd remarks about Sino-Japanese trade.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that the Kishi Nobusuke clique repeatedly claims that their position "is to separate trade from politics," but whenever they mention the issue of Sino-Japanese trade, they hasten to declare that they "do not recognize China" and that they want to link Sino-Japanese trade to their relations with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique and other international relations (which actually refers to relations with the United States) for consideration. It is thus clear that what they oppose is the combination of Sino-Japanese trade and the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. What they want is to make Sino-Japanese trade serve their politics of pleasing the United States, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and being hostile to China. This is the ulterior motive behind their clamoring for the separation of trade and politics. This position of theirs is resolutely opposed by the Chinese people.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi sternly condemned Kishi Nobusuke's absurd remarks that he does not recognize the People's Republic of China as an independent country and that he considers the Chinese national flag as private property. He also pointed out that the Nagasaki incident of insulting the Chinese national flag was manufactured under the direct connivance and protection of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Vice Premier Chen Yi said that these remarks and actions are an insult to the People's Republic of China and a deliberate provocation to the 600 million Chinese people. The Kishi Nobusuke government must bear complete responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that Kishi Nobusuke also boasted that his destruction of the trade agreement and the resulting state of no agreement on Sino-Japanese trade would not hinder the development of trade between the two countries. Kishi Nobusuke thought that China had to do business with Japan, and that the absence of a trade agreement might make it easier for him to impose the will of Japanese monopoly groups on China. But Kishi Nobusuke never thought that a new, independent, and powerful China, having driven away all imperialists, would never allow itself to be manipulated by others. New China does not rely on any imperialism. The United States government, gathering the governments of many countries, including Japan, to impose an embargo on China, could not overwhelm New China. Does Kishi Nobusuke really think that New China, which is developing at a flying speed, must do business with Japan according to Kishi Nobusuke's ideas? This is simply a daydream!

    Vice Premier Chen Yi finally pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government, in order to please the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, sabotaging Sino-Japanese trade, insulting China, and making enemies of the 600 million Chinese people, will never bring any benefit to the Japanese people. On the contrary, it can only lead Japan onto a more unfortunate path. We know that Kishi Nobusuke's attitude does not represent the wishes of the Japanese people. The Japanese Socialist Party is different from Kishi Nobusuke. The Japanese Socialist Party advocates restoring diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China on the basis of not recognizing "two Chinas." Even within the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, there are those who disagree with Kishi Nobusuke's policy of being completely hostile to our country. Will Kishi Nobusuke stand with the Japanese people and abandon the policy of hostility towards China, or will he continue to follow the United States and persist in the policy of hostility towards China? Kishi Nobusuke himself should make a choice. If Kishi Nobusuke is determined to be hostile to the New China to the end, then he will surely reap the bitter fruit. The friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples cannot be destroyed. We firmly believe that the friendship between the two peoples, no matter what obstacles and sabotage it encounters, will eventually overcome all obstacles and continue to develop forward.

### 陈毅副总理兼外长就中日关系发表谈话  揭穿日本政府的帝国主义面目  岸信介破坏中日贸易、纵容暴徒侮辱我国旗必将自食其果

    陈毅副总理兼外长就中日关系发表谈话
    揭穿日本政府的帝国主义面目
    岸信介破坏中日贸易、纵容暴徒侮辱我国旗必将自食其果
    新华社9日讯　陈毅副总理兼外交部长在5月9日接见新华社记者，就当前中日关系发表谈话。
    陈毅副总理在谈话中着重指出，最近日本首相岸信介为了讨好美国和蒋介石集团，公然破坏中日贸易协定，并且对中国进行恶意的和侮辱性的攻击；对于这种挑衅行为，中国人民不能不感到极大愤慨。陈毅副总理特别举出，岸信介政府纵容暴徒在长崎侮辱中国国旗的事件，说明岸信介政府敌视中国的态度已经到了令人不能容忍的地步。
    陈毅副总理说：中国人民是愿意同日本人民友好相处的，并且一直为促进中日友好而努力。因此，尽管日本政府屈从于美国的意志，尽管中日两国间战争状态并未结束，两国人民经过不断的努力，仍然使两国之间的经济、文化和友好联系，几年来得到了很大的发展。两国民间团体和半官方团体签订了四十多项协议，对于促进两国人民的友好关系起了显著的作用。中国政府对于中日两国人民的友好活动和民间协议一贯给予了积极的支持。我们这种态度得到了日本广大人民的欢迎。但是岸信介政府却与此相反，它始终对我国抱着敌视而非善意的态度，并且错把中国的好意当作软弱可欺的迹象。岸信介一方面表示要扩大中日贸易，以图从中国捞取经济实惠，但是，另一方面却粗暴地破坏中日贸易协定，在长崎放纵暴徒侮辱中国国旗，并且亲自带头连篇累牍地发表污蔑和攻击中国的言论。岸信介这种狂妄态度彻底地暴露了他隐藏着的帝国主义面目。
    陈毅副总理指出，过去，日本政府用帝国主义态度同中国打交道，已经遭到中国人民的沉重打击，终于宣告彻底的破产。今天，中国人民已经站起来了，岸信介政府想再用帝国主义态度对付中国，不仅更加行不通，而且必然是搬起石头打自己的脚。
    陈毅副总理着重驳斥了岸信介有关中日贸易的各种荒谬言论。
    陈毅副总理说，岸信介集团口口声声地说，他们的立场“是要把贸易和政治分开”，但是，每当他们提到中日贸易问题的时候，他们就赶忙接着声明他们“不承认中国”，还说要把中日贸易联系到他们同台湾蒋介石集团的关系以及其他国际关系（其实就是指同美国的关系）进行考虑。由此可见，他们反对的是中日贸易同中日两国人民友谊的结合，他们要的是使中日贸易为他们讨好美国、勾结蒋介石集团、敌视中国的政治服务。这就是他们叫嚷要把贸易和政治分开的不可告人的目的。他们的这种立场是中国人民所坚决反对的。
    陈毅副总理严厉地斥责了岸信介不承认中华人民共和国是独立国家，把中国国旗说成是私人财产的荒谬绝顶的言论。并且指出，侮辱中国国旗的长崎事件就是在岸信介政府直接纵容和包庇下制造出来的。陈毅副总理说，这些言论和行动是对中华人民共和国的侮辱，是蓄意向六亿中国人民挑衅。岸信介政府必须对由此而产生的一切后果负完全责任。
    陈毅副总理说，岸信介还扬言他破坏贸易协定、使中日贸易处于无协定状态，也不致于为发展两国贸易带来障碍。岸信介以为中国非同日本做生意不可；而没有贸易协定可能更便利于他把日本垄断集团的意志强加于中国。但是，岸信介竟不想一想，赶走了一切帝国主义的一个独立强大的新中国是绝不会听任别人摆布的。新中国不依靠任何帝国主义。美国政府纠集了包括日本在内的许多国家的政府，对中国实行禁运，都不能把新中国压倒，难道岸信介真以为正在以飞跃的速度向前发展的新中国非按照岸信介的主意同日本作生意不可吗？这简直是痴人说梦！
    陈毅副总理最后指出，岸信介政府为了讨好美国和蒋介石集团，破坏中日贸易、侮辱中国、同六亿中国人民为敌，是绝不会为日本人民带来任何好处，相反，只能把日本引上更加不幸的道路。我们知道，岸信介的这种态度绝不代表日本人民的愿望。日本社会党就同岸信介不同，日本社会党主张站在不承认“两个中国”的立场上，同中华人民共和国恢复邦交。甚至日本自由民主党内部也有人不同意岸信介的一味敌视我国的政策。还是同日本人民站在一起，放弃敌视中国的政策，还是一味追随美国，坚持敌视中国的政策呢？岸信介自己应该作出选择。如果岸信介决心同新中国敌视到底，那么，他就一定要自食其果。中日两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的。我们深信，两国人民的友谊，不管遭到怎样的阻挠和破坏，终将排除一切障碍不断地向前发展。
