Xinhua News Agency, London, 4th Telegraph. The "World News" published here on May 3rd carried a lengthy document from the International Department of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party, expressing "some opinions" on the part of the Draft Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia concerning the international situation. The document stated: "The Draft Program's assessment of the international situation is in serious conflict with our Party's program."

The document said: "The assessment of the international situation, the danger of war, and the struggle for peace affects the Communist parties of all countries. Silence is impossible on this point."

When discussing the British Communist Party's program's assessment of the international situation, the document pointed out that "the danger of war comes from the aggressive policies of imperialism. Socialism defends peace. This has always been the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint." Along with socialist countries, the vast newly independent countries and the people who are struggling for national liberation and against imperialism also support the struggle for peace, oppose the imperialist war plans, and oppose nuclear weapons strategies.

The document then criticized the Draft Program's erroneous argument that the two "hostile military-political blocs" are the cause of international tension. The document pointed out that equating the two is definitely wrong. This is like saying that because the Soviet Union fought Hitler's troops after Hitler's invasion, both Hitler and the Soviet Union were "military states that wanted to resolve disputes with armed forces." The Draft Program uses abstract nouns such as "struggle for hegemony," "power politics," and "the position of strength of this or that great power or group" to conceal the real differences between the two camps without making a specific analysis. The document emphasized that attempting to equate the imperialist camp and the socialist camp under the guise of the "theory" of "two blocs" "results in a complete distortion of the true situation of the world, and doing so can only harm the struggle for peace."

The document also mentioned that the words in the peace declaration of the sixty-four Communist and Workers' parties, which Yugoslavia also signed, answered very clearly the theory about "two blocs" and explained the true nature of the role of socialist countries.

The Yugoslav Program Remains Silent on American Aggressive Activities
But Attacks the Soviet Union's Peace Policy Irrespective of the Facts

The document further pointed out that the Draft Program maintains silence towards American imperialism. The public statements of the main spokespersons of American imperialism regarding the goal of ruling the world with a policy of strength are hidden behind a general description of this policy, as if both camps have the same goal. The United States' aggressive policies and actions in the Far East and the Middle East are ignored. The threat of American offensive bomber bases is not mentioned. Statements about "rolling back the tide of communism" and ending the people's democratic regimes and socialism in Eastern Europe are not considered to be related to the interests of the people of Eastern Europe. The revival of German militarism in West Germany and the threat of West Germany's rearmament with nuclear weapons are glossed over.

Only in one instance is this abstract "fairness" and method of silence replaced by specific attacks directed at one side. This is the attack on the Soviet Union, Stalin, and the socialist countries of Eastern Europe. The document continues that even more significantly, the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences are condemned. The records show that in these conferences, the Soviet Union consistently fought for the victory of the goals of realizing the anti-fascist alliance, destroying Nazism and Fascism, striving for national liberation, and establishing democratic regimes free from the remnants and accomplices of Fascism. If the agreements of these conferences were fully realized, rather than later being abandoned and undermined by Western countries in many ways, we would be in a very different and more favorable world situation today. After the war, the Western imperialist countries tried their best to obstruct the realization of the decisions of these conferences through their policies. The most reactionary representatives, especially in the United States, today regard the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences as objects of particular hatred and condemn them in unison.

Therefore, it is very strange to see that Yugoslav communists also condemn the Soviet Union's policy at these conferences.

Similarly, the divisions of Germany, Korea, and Vietnam are spoken of as if they are not the result of imperialist policies, but also the result of socialist policies, caused by the so-called policy of spheres of interest. This does not conform to historical facts.

Internationalism Principles Cannot be Seen in the Yugoslav Program
It is Wrong Not to Emphasize Cooperation Between Socialist Countries

Next, the document emphasized that "the Draft Program's attitude towards the relations between socialist countries raises a most serious question." The principles of "equality," "national independence," "non-interference," and respect for national characteristics in the relations between socialist countries are only one aspect of the problem. This aspect does not include another aspect that is equally important, that is, socialist countries must carry out organized cooperation, provide mutual assistance in socialist construction in economic terms, and jointly defend their independence in political and military terms. Any statement that ignores this aspect is incomplete and therefore incorrect.

The document said: "The principle of proletarian internationalism cannot be seen in this part of the Draft Program, although it has been mentioned elsewhere. There is only one place where this principle is directly mentioned, and that is to remind people not to ‘establish any type of hegemony in these relations in the name of socialism or proletarian internationalism.’ Therefore, the only place where proletarian internationalism is directly mentioned in this part is also negative."

The document cited the words in the Draft Program: "... Yugoslavia is a part of the European and world family, and as a socialist country, Yugoslavia is also a part of the socialist world, that is, the socialist and progressive forces of modern humanity." The document said: "This very imprecise and very vague passage begins with 'the European and world family' (that is, capitalist countries and socialist countries are all included), and then mentions 'the socialist world,' but then further explains that 'the socialist world' is 'the socialist and progressive forces of modern humanity.' The specific issue of relations between socialist countries is neglected." The document pointed out that on this issue, the Draft Program only emphasized the principles of "equality," "independence," and "non-interference in internal affairs" without emphasizing cooperation between socialist countries.

The document continued, "It is obvious that splitting socialist countries is a wish that imperialism cannot get enough of. They would seize on any sign of division with joy and exaggerate it as much as possible. First of all, imperialism hopes to separate some of the smaller socialist countries in Eastern Europe from the Soviet Union. If they could achieve this goal, they estimate that it would be easier to annex these isolated smaller countries like Hitler did.

"'Unity is strength' is a very long-standing principle in the workers' movement. All the socialist countries in Eastern Europe, with the exception of Yugoslavia so far, are all united in the Warsaw Pact, thereby showing their understanding of this principle."

The document refuted the Draft Program's claim that the Soviet Union's leading role contains the danger of "hegemony" and violates the principles of "equality" and "independence." The document said that for forty years, the Soviet Union has been guiding the way, and its achievements have made it possible for socialism to make progress in an increasing number of countries in the world. Just as the Soviet Union had to assume the main responsibility in the war against Hitler and the elimination of Fascism, the Soviet Union cannot but assume the main responsibility in today's situation of the Cold War and the struggle for peace and the defense of socialism. Cooperation and equality do not exclude the responsibility of leadership. Therefore, the declaration of the Communist and Workers' parties of the twelve socialist countries correctly recognizes the necessity of solidarity and cooperation among socialist countries under the leadership of the Soviet Union.

The document of the International Department of the Central Committee of the British Communist Party also mentioned at the end that other parts of the Draft Program also raised some broader issues belonging to the overall ideological debate: about the analysis of state capitalism in bourgeois countries as a form of state control of capitalists rather than capitalists using the state; about the idea of ​​phased evolution or gradual transition to socialism; denying the leading role of the Communist Party; and even implying that American trade unions may prove to be tools for the transition to socialism in the United States without the need for a working-class party.

### 英共中央国际部的文件指出  南共纲领歪曲世界局势真相  把两个阵营等同看待只能危害争取和平的斗争

    英共中央国际部的文件指出
    南共纲领歪曲世界局势真相
    把两个阵营等同看待只能危害争取和平的斗争
    新华社伦敦4日电　这里5月3日出版的“世界新闻”刊载了英国共产党中央委员会国际部的长篇文件，表示了对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案关于国际局势的部分的“一些意见”。这篇文件说：“纲领草案对国际局势的估计同我们党的纲领的估计有严重的抵触。”
    文件说：“对国际局势、战争的危险和和平斗争的估计影响到所有国家的共产党。在这一点上不可能保持沉默。”
    文件在谈到英共的纲领对国际局势的估计时指出，“战争的危险来自帝国主义的侵略政策。社会主义是维护和平的。这一向是马克思列宁主义的观点。”同社会主义国家一起，广大的新获得独立的国家和正在为争取民族解放、反对帝国主义而斗争的人民，也支持争取和平的斗争，反对帝国主义的战争计划，反对核武器战略。
    文件接着批判了纲领草案把两个“敌对的军事政治集团”说成是造成国际紧张局势的原因的错误论点。文件指出，把这两者等同看待肯定是错误的。这就好像是说，由于苏联在希特勒进犯以后同希特勒军队打了仗，因此希特勒和苏联都是“想以武装力量来解决争端的军事国家”了。纲领草案用“争夺霸权”、“强权政治”、“这个或那个大国或集团的实力地位”等抽象名词来掩盖两个阵营的真正差别而不作具体分析。文件强调说，企图在“两个集团”的“理论”掩盖下来把帝国主义阵营和社会主义阵营等同看待，“结果就导致完全歪曲世界局势的真实情况，这样做只能危害争取和平的斗争。”
    文件中还提到，有南共参加签字的六十四个共产党和工人党的和平宣言中的话就非常清楚地回答了关于“两个集团”的理论，并且说明了社会主义国家的作用的真正性质。
    南共纲领对美国侵略活动保持沉默
    却不顾事实地攻击苏联的和平政策
    文件进一步指出，纲领草案对待美帝国主义是保持沉默。美帝国主义的主要发言人关于以实力政策来统治世界的目标的公开声明被隐藏在对这种政策的笼统说明的后面，好像两个阵营都同样有这种目标似的。美国在远东和中东的侵略政策和行动被忽视。美国的进攻性轰炸机基地的威胁没有被提到。关于“把共产主义浪潮推回去”以及结束东欧人民民主政权和社会主义这种目的的声明不被认为同东欧各国人民利害攸关。西德的德国军国主义的复活和西德用核武器来重新武装的威胁被略而不谈。
    只在一个情况下，这种抽象的“公正”和沉默的方法才为针对一方的具体抨击所代替。这就是对苏联、斯大林和东欧社会主义国家的抨击。文件接着说，更加意味深长的是对德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦会议的谴责。记录表明，在这些会议中，苏联始终一贯地为实现反法西斯同盟的目标、为摧毁纳粹主义和法西斯主义、为争取民族解放和建立摆脱法西斯主义残余和同伙的民主政权的目标的胜利而奋斗。如果这些会议的协议完全实现，而不是后来在许多方面被西方国家所废弃和破坏的话，今天我们就会处在一个大不相同的更加有利的世界局势中。西方帝国主义国家在战后千方百计地用它们的政策来阻碍这些会议的决定的实现。最反动的代表人物，特别是在美国，今天都把德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦会议当做他们特别仇视的对象而同声加以谴责。
    因此，看到南斯拉夫共产主义者也对苏联在这些会议上的政策表示谴责，是很令人奇怪的。
    同样地，德国、朝鲜和越南的分裂状态也被说得好像不是帝国主义的政策的结果，而同样也是社会主义的政策的结果，是由于所谓利益范围政策所造成的。这是并不符合历史事实的。
    在南共纲领中看不到国际主义原则
    不强调社会主义国家合作是错误的
    接着，文件着重指出，“纲领草案对待社会主义国家的关系的态度提出了一个最严重的问题。”社会主义国家关系中的“平等”、“民族独立”、“互不干涉”和尊重民族特点的原则，只是问题的一个方面。这个方面并不包括同样重要的另一个方面，那就是社会主义国家之间必须进行有组织的合作，在经济方面应该在社会主义建设中互相援助，在政治和军事方面要共同保卫它们的独立。任何忽视这个方面的提法都是不全面的、因而也就是不正确的。
    文件说：“在纲领草案的这一部分里看不到无产阶级国际主义的原则，虽然在其他地方曾经提到这一点。只有一个地方直接提到这个原则，而那却是为了提醒人们不要
  ‘以社会主义或者无产阶级国际主义的名义在这些关系中建立任何类型的霸权’。因此，在这一部分里唯一直接提到无产阶级国际主义的地方也是否定的。”
    文件举出了纲领草案中的话：“……南斯拉夫是欧洲和世界大家庭的组成部分，而作为一个社会主义国家，南斯拉夫也是社会主义世界、即现代人类的社会主义和进步力量的组成部分。”文件说：“这一段非常不严密、非常模糊的话开头就用‘欧洲和世界大家庭’（也就是说资本主义国家和社会主义国家统统包括在内），接着再提到‘社会主义世界’，可是随后又进一步解释‘社会主义世界’就是‘现代人类的社会主义和进步力量’。社会主义国家之间的关系这个具体问题就被忽视了。”文件指出，在这个问题上，纲领草案仅仅强调了“平等”、“独立”、“互不干涉内政”这样一些原则而不强调社会主义国家之间的合作。
    文件接着说，“很明显，分裂社会主义国家是帝国主义求之不得的愿望。任何暗示分裂的迹象他们都会欢喜若狂地抓住，并且尽量加以夸大。首先，帝国主义希望把东欧一些较小的社会主义国家同苏联分割开来。如果它们能够实现这一目的，它们估计要像希特勒那样并吞这些陷于孤立的较小的国家就会比较容易一些。
    “‘团结就是力量’是工人阶级运动中一个非常悠久的原则。东欧所有的社会主义国家，到目前为止只有南斯拉夫是例外，全都团结在华沙条约之中，从而表现出它们对这个原则是了解的。”
    文件驳斥了纲领草案所谓苏联的领导作用包含有“霸权”和违背“平等”与“独立”的原则的危险的说法。文件说，四十年来，苏联一直指引着道路，而且由于它的成就使得社会主义有可能在世界上越来越多的一系列国家中取得进展。正像在反对希特勒和消灭法西斯主义的战争中苏联曾经不得不担负主要责任一样，在今天的冷战的情况下和争取和平、保卫社会主义的斗争中苏联也不能不担负主要责任。合作和平等并不排除领导的责任。因此，十二个社会主义国家的共产党和工人党的宣言正确地认识到在苏联起领导作用的情况下社会主义国家团结合作的必要性。
    英共中央国际部的文件在最后还谈到，纲领草案的其他部分也提出了一些属于总的意识形态争论中的更广泛的问题：关于把资产阶级国家中的国家资本主义当作国家控制资本家而不是资本家利用国家的形式的分析；关于分阶段进化或逐渐过渡到社会主义的观念；否认共产党的领导作用；甚至暗示美国工会可能证明是在美国不需要有工人阶级政党就可以过渡到社会主义的工具。
