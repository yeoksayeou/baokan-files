Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 7th: Is it realistic today to build a grand intercontinental dam in the Bering Strait to change the climate of the Northern Hemisphere? The famous Soviet engineer Borisov gave an affirmative answer in the latest issue of "Around the World" magazine. In his article, he introduced the plan he drafted.

The basic content of Borisov's plan is to build a dam linking Asia and America on the Bering Strait. Through this dam, 500 cubic kilometers of seawater will be pumped from the Arctic Ocean into the Pacific Ocean every day and night. In this way, the warm waters of the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean will flow into the Arctic Ocean in large quantities, warming the Arctic region. Borisov said that the total cost of building a dam in the Bering Strait, including power engineering, dam hydraulic engineering, and all auxiliary projects, is estimated to be approximately 100 billion to 110 billion rubles. This amount is only 50% of the annual military budget of the Atlantic group member states.

Pumping 500 cubic kilometers of water from the Arctic Ocean into the Pacific Ocean every day and night is entirely feasible with modern technology. The required power generation capacity for this is 10 million to 12 million kilowatts. The three northern countries of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Canada can meet this need without particularly strenuous efforts at the current scale of production. Initially, it may be possible to establish a floating nuclear power station in the Bering Strait, and later, of course, fixed nuclear power stations will be established. In addition, the abundant natural gas deposits of the Yakut Autonomous Republic can also be used.

As for the construction of the dam itself, it can be carried out by prefabrication. The entire dam can be composed of many huge components, 20 to 60 meters high, depending on the depth of the water. These large components can be manufactured in shipyards and then transported to the strait for installation and connection into a dam. This method of prefabricating the dam can reduce construction costs and shorten construction time. Using this method of climate modification, the temperature will increase the most in winter and along the coldest Arctic coast. The average January temperature in the Arctic region and the northern states of Soviet Siberia can increase by 30 to 35 degrees. The January temperature in the areas of Moscow, Vladivostok, New York, London, and Berlin can increase by 6 to 12 degrees. The January temperature in Moscow will not be lower than zero degrees Celsius. The Northern Sea Route can be open to navigation all year round. The Arctic Ocean should no longer be called the Arctic Ocean. (Attached picture)

    修好白令海峡水坝能改变北半球气候
    苏联工程师提出造福人类的宏伟计划
    据新华社莫斯科7日电　在今天，在白令海峡修建规模宏大的洲际水坝以改变北半球气候的计划是现实的吗？苏联著名工程师鲍里索夫在最近一期“环球”杂志上作了肯定的答复。他在自己的文章中介绍了他所拟定的方案。
    鲍里索夫的方案的基本内容是，在白令海峡上修建一座联结亚、美两洲的大坝，经过这个大坝每昼夜由北冰洋抽送五百立方公里的海水到太平洋中，这样，大西洋中墨西哥湾暖流温暖的海水就会大量流入北冰洋，使北极地区气候变暖。鲍里索夫说，在白令海峡修坝全部费用，包括动力工程和水坝水力工程和一切辅助工程在内，根据初步计算，大约要一千亿到一千一百亿卢布。这个数目只不过是大西洋集团成员国每年军事预算的50％。
    每昼夜从北冰洋抽送五百立方公里的水量到太平洋中，就现代技术水平说来，是完全可以实现的。为此所需的发电能力是一千万到一千二百万瓩，苏联、美国、加拿大三个北方国家在目前生产规模下并不需要特别紧张的努力就可以满足这个需要。最初可能采取在白令海峡上建立一个浮动原子能电站的办法，以后当然就建立固定的原子能电站。除此之外，还可以应用雅库特自治共和国的大量的天然瓦斯矿藏。
    至于堤坝本身的建造，可以用预装配的办法来进行。整个堤坝可以根据水深程度分别用许多巨大的高二十到六十公尺的部件组成。这种大块部件可以在船台上制成，然后送到海峡中安装，接成堤坝。这种预装配堤坝的办法可以使建筑费用低廉，施工时间缩短。采用这个改造气候的方法，温度提高得最多是冬天和最寒冷的北冰洋沿岸。北极地区、苏联西伯利亚北方各州1月份平均温度可以提高三十度到三十五度。在莫斯科、海参崴，纽约，伦敦，柏林一带1月份温度可以提高六度到十二度。莫斯科1月份也不会低到零度以下。北海航线可以全年通航。北冰洋就不再应该叫北冰洋了。（附图片）
