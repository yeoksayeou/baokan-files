Shaanxi, Jiangsu Increase Industrial Organizations at All Levels and Adjust Cadre Strength

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 13th - Reporter Yi Xiao reports: Leadership organs at all levels in Shaanxi Province, with the Party Committee taking the lead, have established and improved industrial management organizations at all levels to adapt to the new situation of rapid development in local industry.

Shaanxi Province plans to build more than 15,000 new factories and mines of various sizes this year and will open up new industrial sectors such as steel, petroleum, and chemicals. At the same time, some state-owned factories and mines managed by the central government are being transferred to the province, and many factories run by the province are being transferred to cities, special districts, and counties. The industrial leadership tasks at all levels have greatly increased.

In order to adapt to this new situation, Party Committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over industry and expanded and improved industrial organizations at all levels. Zhang Desheng, First Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, has recently focused his leadership on industry. In addition to Fang Zhongru, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Shi Yizhi, member of the Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee and Deputy Governor, who were originally responsible for industry, Zhang Ce, Secretary of the Secretariat, is now also specifically responsible for industrial leadership. The Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry has also recently redeployed cadres and reorganized its structure, establishing four new specialized divisions for heavy industry, chemical industry, mining, and light industry, as well as two industrial departments: the Survey and Design Institute and the Industrial Experiment Institute.

Party committees in emerging industrial cities such as Xi'an, Xianyang, and Baoji, as well as in various special districts, have also greatly strengthened their leadership over industry and improved their industrial management organizations. In addition to the First Secretary being responsible for industry, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee has two other secretaries managing local and state-owned industries. At the same time, hundreds of cadres have been transferred to strengthen various industrial departments. The local committees of the Communist Party in various special districts have each assigned a secretary to specifically manage industry. Industrial departments of local committees and industrial bureaus of various administrative offices have also been established one after another.

The vast majority of counties in the province have established local industrial construction committees or industrial leading groups, with one of the secretaries of the County Party Committee and the County Head serving as the director and deputy director, respectively. County Party Committees in various counties have added industrial departments or ministers or deputy ministers specifically in charge of industry. The industrial and transportation sections of the People's Committees of various counties have also been strengthened accordingly. Townships (districts) with industrial construction tasks have also established industrial leading groups of three to seven people, with one of the deputy secretaries of the Township (District) Party Committee and the Deputy Township Head each in charge.

After the establishment of industrial organizations at all levels, they immediately took action. In addition to formulating industrial development plans, local construction committees in various counties have organized and resolved a number of specific problems such as technology, equipment, funding, and resources. Under the specific organization and leadership of these organizations, more than 6,000 new factories and mines throughout the province had been put into production by the end of April.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 13th - Reporters Jiang Qingping and Zhang Jing report: Recently, from the province to the city, county, township, and commune, Communist Party secretaries in Jiangsu have personally taken charge of the construction of local industry and have transferred a large number of cadres to strengthen the industrial front. All counties have newly established or strengthened industrial departments and have also established local industrial construction committees or industrial offices. Each township and commune has appointed a Party secretary, township head, branch secretary, or commune director to personally take the lead and be responsible for the specific leadership of industry. At the same time, the Jiangsu Provincial Industrial Leadership Department has trained more than 300 key leaders for local industrial construction in various places by holding three training courses on biogas, chemical fertilizers, and cement.

In the development of county, township, and commune industries, Party committees at all levels have consistently implemented the policy of facing agriculture and serving agricultural production, and have followed the principle of "from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, from manual operation to semi-mechanization and mechanization, from using existing equipment to adding new equipment, from simple to complete." Therefore, without requiring much investment, many factories have been established quickly. By the end of April, more than 10,300 factories throughout the province had been put into production.

While mobilizing the whole people to run industry, Party committees at all levels have firmly grasped the link of coordination and balance, unified industrial layout, and strengthened cooperation between regions. The province has established four major cooperation zones centered on the four cities of Nanjing, Wuxi, Xuzhou, and Nantong. Within each major cooperation zone, several small cooperation zones have been established with cities as the center and surrounding counties. Various cooperation zones cooperate, support, and exchange with each other in terms of equipment, technology, technical personnel training, raw material supply, and factory management experience.

　　书记挂帅着重抓工业
　　陕西、江苏增设各级工业机构调整干部力量
    本报西安13日电　记者伊晓报道：陕西省各级领导机关以党委挂帅，建立和健全了各级工业管理机构，适应地方工业大发展的新形势。
    陕西省今年要新建大小厂矿一万五千多个，并将开辟钢铁、石油、化工等新的工业部门。同时若干中央管理的国营厂矿下放到省，省营的许多工厂也下放到市、专区和县。各级工业领导任务大大加重。
    为了适应这种新形势，各级党委加强了对工业的领导，并扩建与健全了各级工业机构。中共陕西省委第一书记张德生在最近已经把领导重点放在工业方面。另外，除了原来书记处书记方仲如和省委常委、副省长时逸之专门分工负责工业外，书记处书记张策也专门负责工业领导工作。陕西省工业厅最近也调配干部，重新调整了机构，新设置了重工业、化学工业、矿业、轻工业四个专业处和勘察设计院、工业试验所两个工业部门。
    西安、咸阳、宝鸡等新兴工业城市和各个专区的党委也大大加强了对工业的领导，健全了工业管理机构。中共西安市委除由第一书记负责工业外，又由两位书记管理地方工业和国营工业。同时抽调了数百名干部充实各工业部门。各个专区的中共地方委员会都抽出一个书记专门管理工业。各地委工业部、各专署工业局也都先后成立。
    全省绝大部分县都分别成立了地方工业建设委员会或工业领导小组，由中共县委书记和县长中各抽一人担任正副主任。各县县委增设了工业部门或专管工业的部长或副部长。各县人民委员会的工业交通科也都相应加强。有工业建设任务的乡（区），也成立了三到七人的工业领导小组，由乡（区）党委副书记和副乡长各一人负责。
    各级工业机构建立后，立即行动起来了。各县地方建设委员会，除都已制定出发展工业规划外，并组织解决了技术、设备、资金、资源等若干具体问题。在这些机构具体组织领导下，到4月底止，全省已有六千多个新厂矿投入生产。
    本报南京13日电　记者蒋青萍、张竞报道：最近一个时期，江苏从省到市县、乡、社，中共党委书记都亲自挂帅，抓地方工业的建设工作，并抽调了大批干部加强工业战线。各县都新成立或加强了工业部门，还成立了地方工业建设委员会或工业办公室等。各乡、社都确定了一个党委书记、乡长或支部书记、社长等亲自挂帅，负责工业的具体领导。与此同时，江苏省工业领导部门通过举办沼气、化肥、水泥三个训练班，为各地培养了三百多个领导地方工业建设的主要骨干。
    在发展县、乡、社工业中，各级党委坚持贯彻了面向农业，为农业生产服务的方针，并遵循了“由小到大，由土到洋，由手工业操作到半机械化、机械化，由利用现有设备到增加新的设备，由简陋到完备”的原则。因此，不需要多少投资，许多工厂很快就建立起来了。到4月下旬为止，全省就有一万零三百多个工厂投入生产。
    各级党委在发动全民办工业的同时，紧紧抓住协作平衡这一环节，统一工业布局，加强地区之间的协作。全省以南京、无锡、徐州、南通四个市为中心成立了四个大协作区，每个大协作区内又以城市为中心，和周围各县成立几个小协作区。各协作区在设备、技术、技术人员培训、原材料供应和工厂管理经验等方面互相配合、互相支持、互相交流。
