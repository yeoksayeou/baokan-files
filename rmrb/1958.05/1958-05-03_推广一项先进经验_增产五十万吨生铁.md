    Promoting an Advanced Experience
    Increasing Pig Iron Production by 500,000 Tons
    (Our dispatch) The National Non-Ferrous Metal Ore Dressing Production Leap Forward Conference, recently held in Benxi, attached great importance to the "combined magnetic separation and gravity separation process" for ore dressing created by the Nanfen Ore Dressing Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company. This ore dressing method can increase the output of iron ore concentrate powder. According to calculations at the conference, if the Anshan and Benxi Iron and Steel enterprises promote this ore dressing method, they can increase pig iron production by 500,000 tons per year.

    推广一项先进经验
    增产五十万吨生铁
    本报讯　最近在本溪召开的全国黑色金属选矿生产跃进会议，十分重视本溪钢铁公司南芬选矿厂创造的“磁力选矿和重力选矿联合流程”的选矿方法。这种选矿法，可以增加铁矿精矿粉的产量。据会议计算，鞍山和本溪两个钢铁企业，推广这种选矿方法，一年可以增产生铁五十万吨。
