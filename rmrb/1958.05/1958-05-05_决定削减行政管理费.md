    Decided to Reduce Administrative Expenses
    The article "Who Has the Highest Management Fee?" published in the People's Daily on March 21st criticized our factory for spending too much on administrative expenses last year and for extravagant waste. This criticism is basically correct. According to preliminary investigation, our factory wasted more than 33,000 yuan on travel expenses, transportation fees, and office expenses last year. Due to lax control over the use of funds by the leadership, the factory bought camellias for 60 yuan a pot, and dragon tongue palms for 260 yuan a pot. Other wasteful phenomena, such as excessive use of vehicles and casually sending people on business trips, and printing forms that would not be used up in fourteen years, should all be criticized.
    Now, we have decided to reduce this year's administrative expenses by 130,000 yuan compared to last year.

    决定削减行政管理费
    3月21日人民日报登载的“谁的管理费最高”一文内，批评我厂去年消耗的行政管理费太高，有铺张浪费现象。这个批评基本上是正确的。根据初步检查，我厂去年在旅差费、交通费、办公费等项目上就浪费三万三千余元。由于领导上对资金使用控制不严，厂里买了六十元一盆的茶花，还买了二百六十元一盆的龙台掌。其他如滥用车辆，随便派人出差，印制十四年也用不完的表格等浪费现象，都应该受到批评。
    现在，我们已决定削减今年的行政管理费用，比去年减少十三万元。
