Fighting on the Guizhou Plateau

The railway workers constructing the Duyun-Guiyang section of the Guizhou-Guangxi Railway have created some mechanized tools that do not require motive power, and various "combined transportation" construction methods, which greatly improved work efficiency, saved raw materials, and reduced labor intensity.
