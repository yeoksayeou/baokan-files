    Brief Review of "Our Teacher"
    Xiong Jinding
    I lived in the same village as Comrade Xu Teli, was his student, and worked with him for a long time. Therefore, I am quite familiar with and understand various aspects of Xu Lao's work and life. For a long time, I wanted to systematically organize Xu Lao's life qualities, exemplary deeds, and remarks on education and politics, so that they could be widely disseminated and imitated. However, because I am old and sick, and my strength is not enough, year after year, it has not been realized. Suddenly, last winter, the Beijing Publishing House sent me the proof of the book "Our Teacher" and asked me to give my opinion. After reading it carefully, I felt that this booklet had truthfully and plainly recorded a large part of Xu Lao's early years of teaching students according to their aptitude, tirelessly teaching, running schools frugally, and running schools for the revolution. Most of these facts were seen and heard by the author, so they are written in more detail, specifically and vividly. The dates and reasons are also relatively clear and accurate, with the role of historical data. This is because the author, Zhou Shizhao, is also Xu Lao's student and a teacher in the school run by Xu Lao. He has also been engaged in education work for decades and is still engaged in education work. Therefore, he has a perceptual understanding of Xu Lao's dedication to education, and he has collected more materials in this area, so he has something to write and writes with emotion. As for writing about Xu Lao's dedication to revolutionary struggle, it is not as detailed as writing about educational life, and it does not write out the full picture of Xu Lao's three firsts (revolution first, work first, others first). But it also wrote about some, especially the articles "A Textbook Without Words," "Old Hero in the Long March Team," and "Strong Old Warrior," which are all enough to express Xu Lao's revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism. Therefore, I am very happy to see this booklet. I have been waiting for such a booklet for many years. I am more willing to recommend this booklet to revolutionary cadres, people's teachers, and young students. Because it is of great significance for cultivating a revolutionary outlook on life, inspiring revolutionary enthusiasm, and promoting everyone's selfless labor to build socialism; it is also very enlightening for helping teachers and students implement the policy of running schools frugally and studying while working, in order to cultivate new-type laborers with both morality and talent, and with both hands and brains.
    Of course, this booklet is not completely without shortcomings. I think the most obvious shortcomings are: First, the author's grasp of the material is not comprehensive enough, so some things that should have been written were not written. Second, the focus is not prominent enough, and some things that do not need to be written are written. Third, although it basically achieves writing facts directly, there are still individual places where the process of the facts is omitted due to only paying attention to the embellishment of the text. I hope that the author will revise and supplement these in the future. I hope that many people will write about Xu Lao, and write many more substantial and comprehensive booklets for everyone to read and emulate!

    简评“我们的师表”
    熊瑾玎
    我与徐特立同志住在一个乡里，是他的学生，跟随他工作了很久，因此，对徐老的工作和生活各方面的情况比较熟悉，也比较了解。很久以来就想把徐老生平的品质、模范的事迹、有关教育、政治各方面的言论，系统地整理出来，以广流传而资模仿。可是因为我年老多病，力不从心，以致年复一年，终未实现。忽去年冬，北京出版社将“我们的师表”一书之校样送给我看，并嘱我提出意见。我详细看过后，觉得这本小册子已真实地、朴质地把徐老早年因材施教、诲人不倦、勤俭办学、为革命办学的事实记述了一大部分，而这些事实多半是作者耳闻目见，因此写得比较详尽、具体而生动。记年月，叙原委，也比较明确无误，具有史料的作用。这是由于作者周世钊也是徐老的学生，又在徐老所办的学校里作教员，他也是搞了几十年教育工作，现在还在搞教育工作的人，所以对徐老尽瘁于教育的精神，既有感性认识的基础，这方面的材料也比较收集得多，因此有东西可写，写来也有感情。至于写徐老致力革命斗争就不如写教育生活那样详细了，也没有把徐老三个第一（革命第一，工作第一，他人第一）的全貌写出来。但是也写到了一些，特别像“一本没有字的教科书”，“长征队伍中的老英雄”，“坚强的老战士”诸条，都是足以表现徐老革命的英雄主义和革命的乐观主义精神的。因此，我很高兴地看到这本小册子，我多年在盼望着有这样一本小册子。我更愿意向革命干部、人民教师和青年学生推荐这本小册子。因为它对培养革命的人生观，鼓舞革命的干劲，促进大家忘我劳动以建设社会主义是有很大的意义的；对于帮助教师和学生贯彻勤俭办学，勤工俭学的方针，以培养德才兼备、手脑并用的新型劳动者，也大有所启示。
    当然，这本小册子并不是完全没有缺点的。我认为最容易看出来的缺点是：一，作者对材料的掌握不够全面，所以有些应该写上的东西没有写上。二，重点不够突出，有些不一定要写的东西却又写上了。三，虽然基本上做到了据事直书，但还有个别的地方由于只注意文字的润饰，不免把事实的过程有所省略。这些都希望作者将来加以修订补充。更希望有很多人来写徐老，写出很多更充实、更全面的小册子出来以供大家阅读和效法！
