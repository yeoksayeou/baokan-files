Xinhua News Agency, 6th: One hundred agricultural machinery scientific staff will depart in batches to rural areas across the country in May to support farmers in extensively carrying out agricultural tool reform movements. They are organized by the Ministry of Agriculture and the First Ministry of Machine Building.

According to the person in charge of organizing this work, overcoming the shortage of technical forces in rural areas by every possible means during the Great Leap Forward in Production is a pressing problem that needs to be solved. Therefore, organizing agricultural machinery staff nationwide to go to the countryside and mountains in stages and batches to directly support agricultural production is of great significance for promoting the tool reform movement. He also said that this will have a far-reaching impact on reforming intellectuals, closely integrating scientific work with practice, summarizing and improving the creative experience of the masses, and improving farmers' technology and culture.

In addition to helping farmers reform tools and repair various machines, the agricultural machinery staff who go to the countryside and mountains this time will also assist various regions in planning for agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization, selecting and finalizing the types of machinery manufactured at home and abroad, inspecting and assisting in improving the manufacturing quality of machinery, helping and preparing to establish relevant research institutions, and combining this with publicizing and popularizing scientific and technological knowledge.

The main approach for going to the countryside and mountains this time is to plant "experimental fields." The units going to the countryside and mountains will establish contact with counties or special districts respectively and organize technical forces to divide areas of responsibility in a planned manner. The first batch of participants to go to the countryside and mountains includes lecturers, teaching assistants, research personnel and relevant staff totaling one hundred people from the Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, the South China Agricultural Mechanization Research Institute, the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the Tractor Research Institute, and the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute, the Changchun Tractor Institute and other units.

    一批农业科学人员下乡
    支援农业生产　促进工具改革
    新华社6日讯　一百名农业机械科学工作人员，将在5月里分批动身到全国各地农村，支援农民广泛开展农具改革运动。他们是农业部和第一机械工业部组织的。
    据组织这项工作的有关负责人说，在生产大跃进中，千方百计地克服农村中技术力量不足的困难，是目前急需解决的问题。因此在全国范围内组织农业机械工作人员分期、分批下乡上山，直接支援农业生产，对促进工具改革运动具有十分重要的意义。他又说，这对改造知识分子，使科学工作密切结合实际，总结并提高群众的创造经验，以及提高农民的技术和文化等方面，也将产生深远的影响。
    这次下乡上山的农业机械工作人员，除帮助农民改革工具和修理各项机器外，还将协助各地进行农业半机械化和机械化的规划、进行国内外制造的机具的选样定型、检查和协助改进机械的制造质量、帮助和筹建有关研究机构，并结合宣传普及科学技术知识。
    这次下乡上山主要采取种“试验田”的办法进行。由下乡上山的单位分别和县或专区建立联系，有计划地组织技术力量分片包干。参加第一批下乡上山的有中国农业科学院农业机械化研究所、南京农业机械化研究所、华南农业机械化研究所、第一机械工业部农业机械研究所、拖拉机研究所及北京农业机械化学院、长春拖拉机学院等单位的讲师、助教、研究人员和有关工作人员共一百名。
