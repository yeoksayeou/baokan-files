    Notes

    "Talent" for Getting Beaten
    U.S. Vice President Nixon has truly become a "street rat," shouted at and beaten everywhere he goes in Latin American countries. This fully reflects the bankruptcy of the U.S. imperialist policy towards Latin America.
    However, a Reuters news item reported this matter from another angle, saying that Nixon would find, after this "goodwill visit" of being beaten and scolded, that "his personal talents have been improved." This is not difficult to understand. Nixon's "talent" for getting beaten and scolded has indeed improved. Because, after being scolded and beaten in many places, he still has the face to continue this kind of "visit." If his "talent" hadn't improved, how could he do this?

### 挨揍“才干”

    挨揍“才干”
    美国副总统尼克松真正成了“过街老鼠”，在拉丁美洲各国所到之处，人人喊打。这充分反映了美国对拉丁美洲的帝国主义政策的破产。
    但是，路透社的一条消息却从另一个角度报道了这件事，它说，尼克松在挨打受骂的“亲善访问”之后会发现，“他个人的才干已经得到了提高”。这是不难理解的。尼克松挨揍挨骂的“才干”的确提高了。因为，他在多处挨骂挨揍之后，居然还有脸把这种“访问”继续下去，不是“才干”提高了，怎么会能这样呢？
