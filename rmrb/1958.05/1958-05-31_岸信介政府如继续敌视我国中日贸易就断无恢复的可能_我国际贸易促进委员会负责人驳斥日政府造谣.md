Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: According to a report by Japan's Jiji Press on the 26th, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has mischievously interpreted a telegram sent on the 24th by the representative of a Japanese trading company stationed in Beijing to relevant Japanese organizations regarding the so-called "true intentions" of the Chinese side regarding Sino-Japanese trade, as a probe by the Chinese side to restore trade with Japan. In this regard, a Xinhua News Agency reporter visited the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and a responsible person of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade made the following statement:

The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs says that the Chinese side is conducting a probe through the representative of a Japanese trading company stationed in Beijing. This is a shameless fabrication, and it also shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to play its usual trick of confusing the public and deceiving the Japanese people.

The interruption of Sino-Japanese trade is the result of the Kishi Nobusuke government's disregard for the will of the majority of the Japanese people and its hostility towards China. On May 24th, at his first press conference after the Japanese general election, Kishi Nobusuke once again stated that he would not recognize the People's Republic of China and arrogantly demanded that China "reflect." After destroying the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the Kishi Nobusuke government even signed a so-called trade agreement with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. All of this shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government not only has no intention of repenting, but will also persist in its policy of hostility towards China.

"Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi's statement on Sino-Japanese relations on May 9th has already explained China's attitude in detail. Apart from that, there is no so-called 'true intention' of China. As long as the Kishi Nobusuke government continues to antagonize China and continues to treat China with an imperialist attitude, there will be absolutely no possibility of restoring Sino-Japanese trade."

    岸信介政府如继续敌视我国  中日贸易就断无恢复的可能
    我国际贸易促进委员会负责人驳斥日政府造谣
    新华社30日讯　据日本时事通讯社26日报道，日本外务省把日本贸易公司驻北京的代表在24日拍发给日本有关团体的所谓中国方面对于中日贸易的“真正意图”的电报，别有用心地解释成为中国方面为了恢复同日本的贸易而进行的试探。为此，新华社记者走访中国国际贸易促进委员会，承中国国际贸易促进委员会负责人发表谈话如下：
    日本外务省说中国方面通过日本贸易公司驻北京的代表进行试探。这是无耻的捏造，同时也表明了，岸信介政府继续在玩弄混淆视听、欺骗日本人民的一贯手法。
    中日贸易的中断是岸信介政府违背大多数日本人民的意志、敌视中国的结果。本月24日，岸信介在日本大选以后的第一次记者招待会上，再一次表示不承认中华人民共和国，并且狂妄地要求中国进行“反省”。岸信介政府在破坏了第四次中日贸易协定以后，更同台湾蒋介石集团签订了所谓贸易协定。这一切说明，岸信介政府不仅丝毫没有悔改之意，而且将坚持敌视中国的政策。
    “5月9日，陈毅副总理兼外交部长就中日关系发表的谈话，已经详细地说明了中国的态度，除此以外，再没有什么所谓中国的‘真正意图’。只要岸信介政府继续敌视中国，继续用帝国主义的态度对待中国，中日贸易就断无恢复的可能。”
