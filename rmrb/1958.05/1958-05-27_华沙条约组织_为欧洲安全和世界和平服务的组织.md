The Warsaw Treaty Organization
——An Organization Serving European Security and World Peace

From May 11 to 14, 1955, Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, eight socialist countries, gathered in Warsaw to discuss the issue of guaranteeing European peace and security, and concluded the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance; according to the treaty, the Joint Command of the Armed Forces of the States Parties and the Political Consultative Committee were established, which is commonly known as the Warsaw Treaty Organization.

The Warsaw Treaty Organization is a peace-keeping organization. It was established because socialist countries faced a new situation in Europe due to the Western countries' decision to arm West Germany and pull it into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, and decided to take necessary measures to ensure their own security and maintain European peace. It is fundamentally different from the military alliance treaties and military aggression blocs between imperialist countries. In November 1957, the communique of the meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries pointed out: "In the reality that Western countries have rejected the socialist countries' proposal to abolish both military groups, the Warsaw Treaty Organization should exist and be strengthened; this organization is defensive and serves the security of the people of European countries and world peace."

The Warsaw Treaty Organization is a powerful proof of the peace policy of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union. Article 1 of the Warsaw Treaty stipulates that the contracting states "guarantee in their international relations not to threaten or use force, and to resolve their international disputes by peaceful means, so as not to endanger international peace and security." The treaty also declares that the contracting states will "participate in all international actions aimed at guaranteeing international peace and security in the spirit of sincere cooperation, and contribute all their strength to achieve these goals."

The Warsaw Treaty Organization provides a solid foundation for the struggle for pan-European security and lasting peace in Europe. It uses the policy of collective security to counter the policy of reviving West German militarism and establishing exclusive military blocs. Because it is defensive in nature, it opens its doors to other countries, while the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, because it is an aggressive organization, does not allow other countries to participate. In the Warsaw Treaty, the contracting states clearly declare that once the pan-European collective security system that the contracting states have consistently pursued is established and the pan-European treaty is signed, the Warsaw Treaty will become invalid from the time the pan-European treaty comes into effect.

The Chinese people give full support and cooperation to the Warsaw Treaty Organization. Our country has successively sent observers to attend the Warsaw Conference and the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty. At the Warsaw Conference, Vice Premier and Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai solemnly declared on behalf of the Chinese people: "If European peace is undermined, if the imperialist aggressors ignite the flames of war against the peaceful countries of Europe, then our government and our 600 million heroic people will definitely carry out a joint anti-aggression struggle with the governments and people of our brother countries until the final victory." The establishment of the Warsaw Treaty Organization "is not only a very necessary measure to ensure European peace and security, but will also have a profound impact on peace and security in Asia."

The Warsaw Treaty Organization established a Political Consultative Committee, with representatives from each contracting state participating, to implement the consultations between the contracting states stipulated in the treaty and to review the issues arising from the implementation of the treaty. The chairmanship of the committee meetings is held in rotation by representatives of the contracting states.

The contracting states allocated armed forces and established the Joint Command of the Armed Forces. Its headquarters is located in Moscow, and Soviet Marshal I. S. Konev was appointed as the Commander-in-Chief, and the Ministers of National Defense or other military leaders of the contracting states served as Deputy Commanders-in-Chief.

### 华沙条约组织——为欧洲安全和世界和平服务的组织

    华沙条约组织
    ——为欧洲安全和世界和平服务的组织
    1955年5月11日至14日，阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联、捷克斯洛伐克八个社会主义国家，在华沙集会，讨论了保障欧洲和平和安全的问题，缔结了友好合作互助条约；根据条约建立了缔约国武装部队联合司令部和政治协商委员会，这就是以后通称的华沙条约组织。
    华沙条约组织是维护和平的组织。它是社会主义国家面临着由于西方国家决定武装西德，并把它拉入北大西洋侵略集团而在欧洲所形成的新情况下，决定采取必要措施以保证自身安全和维护欧洲和平所建立起来的。它同帝国主义国家之间的军事同盟条约和军事侵略集团有着根本性质的不同。1957年11月，社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议公报指出：“在西方国家拒绝社会主义国家关于取消双方军事集团的建议的现实情况下，华沙条约组织应该存在和加强；这个组织是防御性的，是为欧洲各国人民的安全和世界和平服务的。”
    华沙条约组织是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营国家的和平政策的有力证明。华沙条约的第一条就规定各缔约国“保证在它们的国际关系中不以武力相威胁或使用武力，并以和平方法解决它们的国际争端，以免危及国际和平和安全。”条约还宣布：各缔约国将“本着诚恳合作的精神参加所有旨在保障国际和平和安全的国际行动，并贡献它们的全部力量来达到这些目的”。
    华沙条约组织为争取全欧安全和欧洲持久和平的斗争提供了巩固的基础。它用集体安全的政策同复活西德军国主义和建立排他性的军事集团的政策相对抗。由于它是防御性质的，它对其他国家都开着大门，而北大西洋公约组织由于它是侵略性的组织，是不让其他国家参加的。在华沙条约中，各缔约国明确地宣布：一旦各缔约国所一贯追求的全欧集体安全体系成立，全欧条约签订，华沙条约将从全欧条约生效时起失效。
    中国人民对华沙条约组织给予完全的支持和合作。我国曾先后派遣观察员出席华沙会议和华沙条约政治协商委员会会议。在华沙会议上，彭德怀副总理兼国防部长代表中国人民庄严宣布：“如果欧洲和平受到破坏，如果帝国主义侵略者向欧洲和平国家点起了战火，那么，我国政府和我国六亿英勇的人民一定同我们的兄弟国家的政府和人民进行共同的反侵略斗争，直到最后的胜利”。成立华沙条约组织“不仅是保障欧洲和平和安全非常必要的措施，同时对于亚洲的和平和安全也将发生深刻的影响”。
    华沙条约组织设立了政治协商委员会，由各缔约国派代表参加，以实行条约所规定的缔约国之间的磋商和审查由于条约的实施所引起的问题。委员会会议的主席由各缔约国代表轮流担任。
    缔约国拨出了武装部队，成立了武装部队联合司令部。它的总部设在莫斯科，苏联元帅科?夫被任命为总司令，各缔约国的国防部长或其他军事领导人员任副总司令。
