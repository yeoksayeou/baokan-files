    Planting Beans on Field Ridges Has Many Benefits
    In rice-growing areas, there are many field ridges, especially in mountainous terraced fields where small ridges are abundant. If these ridges are utilized to plant crops, the harvest can be considerable.
    In Nancheng and Gao'an, Jiangxi, there is a type of field ridge bean that is directly sown on the ridges after transplanting rice seedlings from late April to early May. It can be harvested in late October, with a yield of generally twenty to thirty jin per mu of field ridge. If field ridge beans are unavailable, early soybeans, mung beans, cowpeas, etc., can all be planted. Planting beans on field ridges has many benefits: it can economically utilize land to increase grain production; moreover, legumes can absorb free nitrogen from the air, requiring less fertilizer. Therefore, intercropping legumes should be widely promoted on field ridges in rice-growing areas.　Deng Yi

    田塍种豆好处多
    在水稻区有许多田塍，尤其是山区梯田小田塍多，如果将田塍利用起来种上庄稼，收获是不小的。
    江西南城、高安等地有一种田塍豆，在4月下旬到5月上旬插完秧直播在田塍上，10月下旬就可收获，每亩田塍产量一般是二十到三十斤。如无田塍豆，早大豆、绿豆、豇豆等都可以种。田塍上种豆好处多：能经济利用土地增加粮食；而且豆类能吸收空中游离氮，需肥不多。所以水稻区田塍应大量推广间作豆类。　登邑
