Delicious and Affordable Root Vegetable Foods

　　Recently, some chefs in Foshan City, Guangdong Province, have experimented with using sweet potatoes mixed with rice, flour, and other ingredients to create more than 1,500 kinds of exquisite, delicious, nutritious, and inexpensive pastries and foods, which are very popular among customers. Here are the methods for making some of them:

　　Steamed Buns
　　(Such as large buns, bean paste buns, barbecued pork buns, steamed bread, etc.)

　　Ingredients: 11 taels of cooked sweet potatoes, 8 taels of flour, 1 tael of oil, 5 taels of white sugar, 4 qian of baking soda.

　　Method: First, mix 1 tael of dough starter, 5 taels of flour, and 11 taels of cooked sweet potatoes evenly (no water needed). After fermentation for about 6 hours (10 to 12 hours in cold weather), add white sugar, oil, baking soda, smelling salts, and the remaining flour, mix evenly, and then make various buns as desired. After making, steam over high heat for about 10 minutes until done.

　　Comparison: The color and volume are the same as those made entirely of flour, but they are softer and smoother.

　　Song Gao (Steamed Rice Cake)

　　Ingredients: 3 jin of cooked sweet potatoes, 3.5 jin of rice flour, 2.5 jin of white sugar (or brown sugar), 3 qian of baking soda, 3 qian of alkaline water (about 2 spoons)

　　Method: Mix 4 taels of dough starter with rice flour and cooked sweet potatoes evenly. After fermenting for 5-6 hours (the standard is that the volume increases by 1.5 to 2 times), add sugar (if using brown sugar, dissolve it with half a jin of water first), baking soda, and alkaline water. Stir well and steam for about 35 minutes until done (after steaming, you can apply a layer of oil on the cake surface).

　　Comparison: No different from those made with pure rice flour.

　　Rice

　　Ingredients: 10 jin of rice, 7 jin of sweet potatoes.

　　Method: First, cut the sweet potatoes into small pieces (slightly larger than rice grains), marinate them with salt for 2-3 hours, then wash and steam until cooked. Then mix them evenly with the rice.

　　Comparison: Just as fragrant and delicious as pure rice.

　　(Note: The reason for using salt to marinate is: ① to reduce the moisture in the sweet potato pieces, making them harder and less likely to fall apart; ② to reduce the sweetness, so that it harmonizes with the taste of the rice.)

　　味美价廉的薯类食物
    广东佛山市的一些厨师，近来试验用甘薯掺入米、面和其他一些配料，制成了一千五百多种精美可口、营养丰富、价格便宜的糕点食物，深受顾客欢迎。这里介绍其中几种食物的制法：
    蒸包
    （如大包、豆沙包、叉烧包、馒头等）
    原料：熟甘薯十一两，面粉八两，油一两，白糖五两，苏打四钱。
    制法：先将面丕一两、面粉五两、熟甘薯十一两搓匀（不用加水），候发酵约六小时（天冷需十到十二小时）后，放进白糖、油、苏打、臭粉和余下的面粉混合搓匀，便可随意制作各种包子。制好后用烈火蒸约十分钟即成。
    比较：色泽和体积与全面制的一样，较软滑可口些。
    松糕
    原料：熟甘薯三斤，米粉三斤半，白糖（或红糖）二斤半，苏打粉三钱，碱水三钱（约二匙）
    制法：将面丕四两和米粉、熟甘薯搓匀，候发酵五、六小时（即体积涨大一倍半到二倍为标准），然后放进糖（如用红糖需先用半斤水溶解它）、苏打粉、碱水，搅匀后蒸约三十五分钟即成（蒸熟后可在糕面涂上一层油）。
    比较：和纯米粉做的无差别。
    饭
    原料：大米十斤，甘薯七斤。
    制法：先将甘薯切成细粒（比米粒略大），用盐腌二、三小时后洗净蒸熟，然后同大米饭混匀即成。
    比较：与纯大米饭一样清香可口。
    （注：所以要用盐腌是：①减少薯粒内的水份，叫薯粒变硬不易烂；②减少甜味，叫它同饭味调和。）
