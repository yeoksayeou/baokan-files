Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 5th: The Indonesian Peace Committee, in a statement issued today, called on peace-loving people around the world to make efforts to stop foreign interference and aggression against Indonesia.

The statement said that Indonesia's national sovereignty is under tremendous threat, and foreign countries are grossly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs with armed actions. The statement hopes that people of goodwill around the world will support the Indonesian people.

Seventeen mass organizations in Jakarta, including veterans, workers, farmers, youth, women, and students, held a joint meeting on the 4th. The resolution unanimously adopted at the meeting expressed support for Prime Minister Djuanda's statement condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for helping Indonesian rebels, and decided to launch a movement against foreign interference, calling on mass organizations across the country to organize action committees to carry out this movement.

The resolution also called on the people of other countries, especially Asian and African countries, to jointly condemn foreign interference in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 5th: Mass organizations in various parts of Indonesia continue to express support for Prime Minister Djuanda's statement condemning the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique for interfering in Indonesia.

The Indonesian Peasants' Front issued a statement on the 4th on behalf of its 3.5 million members, protesting against the U.S. government and demanding that the U.S. government immediately stop the hostile activities of Americans against Indonesia. The Peasants' Front also demanded that the government take clear action to deal with members of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Indonesia and demanded that the Chiang Kai-shek clique's "representative" be expelled from the United Nations.

The Indonesian Women's Movement Association sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the United Nations on the 4th, strongly protesting against U.S. interference in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 5th: Jakarta newspapers published editorials today, pointing out that U.S. interference in Indonesia constitutes an act of aggression, and calling on the Indonesian people to resist the aggressors.

"Merdeka" (Independence) said that we should mobilize all forces domestically to resist the aggressors, and take action internationally to subject the aggressors and their supporters to the sanctions of the world and all mankind.

"Harian Rakjat" (People's Daily) called on the Indonesian people to unite closely to resist the act of aggression. The newspaper pointed out that the enemies within the country should be eliminated first.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 5th: According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Minister of Information Sudibjo stated on the 4th that he did not believe the official U.S. assurance that the U.S. government bears no responsibility for the participation of certain U.S. citizens in the armed forces of the rebels.

When explaining the issue of foreign interference in Indonesia, Sudibjo pointed out that the bloc of countries headed by the United States is feeling increasingly desperate and wants to bring Indonesia into its sphere of influence. Since the beginning of the Indonesian revolution, there have always been elements within this country pursuing a policy of cooperation with this bloc. These elements are attempting to make Indonesia abandon its independent path and foreign policy of seeking world peace, and they are now trying to make Indonesia join the bloc of countries headed by the United States.
