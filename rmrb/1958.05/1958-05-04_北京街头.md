    Department Store
    Department stores have new things,
    Even a penny can buy something.
    Goods are complete, choose as you please,
    Choose a thousand times and they still won't be annoyed.
    Bookstore Entrance
    Before opening hours,
    You can still buy books.
    The salesperson sacrifices their rest,
    So you don't waste your time.
    Savings Office
    People come and go at the savings office,
    The number of depositors increases day by day,
    They arrange their household finances early,
    No longer worried about rice or oil.
    On the Trolleybus
    The trolleybus rings,
    Illustrated magazines hang on the windows,
    Even a minute is precious,
    Don't fail the ticket seller's good intentions.
    Hotel
    Thoughtful, meticulous, and attentive,
    Asking about temperature and showing concern,
    Though you're thousands of miles from home,
    All the world is family.
    In the Cinema
    The mother is inside the cinema,
    The child is outside the cinema.
    "Mom, go ahead and watch with peace of mind,
    This is even better than a nursery". (Attached picture)

    北京街头
    江城诗
    苗地画
    百货大楼
    百货大楼新鲜事，
    一分钱也买东西。
    货物齐全任你挑，
    千挑万挑总不恼。
    书店门口
    营业时间未到，
    也能买到图书，
    营业员牺牲了休息，
    为的不使你走冤枉路。
    储蓄所
    人来人往储蓄所，
    存户一天一天多，
    早把家用安排好，
    再不愁米又不愁油。
    电车上
    电车上，响叮噹，
    画报杂志挂满窗，
    一分光阴也宝贵，
    莫辜负售票员的好心肠。
    旅馆
    体贴细心周到，
    问凉问暖殷勤，
    休道离家千里，
    天涯都是亲人。
    在电影院
    妈妈在电影院里，
    娃娃在电影院外。
    “妈，您放心去看吧，
    这里比托儿所还好”。（附图片）
