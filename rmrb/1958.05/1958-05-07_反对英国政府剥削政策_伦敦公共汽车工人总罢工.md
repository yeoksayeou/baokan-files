Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th: London bus company workers began a general strike at midnight on the 4th. On the morning of the 5th, all 8,400 buses, trolleybuses, and long-distance buses in London had stopped running. This is the first major strike by London bus workers since 1937.

The strike, involving 50,000 workers, was triggered by the British government-owned London Transport Executive's refusal to meet the workers' demands for higher wages.

Xinhua News Agency, London, May 5th: Reporter Qian Hang reports: London bus workers demonstrated complete solidarity and excellent organization during the strike.

Not a single wheel turned on the 8,400 buses. Order prevailed everywhere.

The Central Strike Committee passed a resolution today praising and thanking the striking workers for demonstrating their spirit of unity.

Congratulatory and supportive letters from workers in various industrial sectors poured into the headquarters of the Transport and General Workers' Union all day today.

The Amalgamated Engineering Union, the second largest union in Britain with 982,000 members, passed an emergency resolution guaranteeing full support for the bus workers.

Abraham Moffat, president of the Scottish Mineworkers' Union, guaranteed moral and financial support for the bus workers at a rally in Edinburgh attended by 100,000 miners and their families.

    这次有五万人参加的罢工是由于英国政府所有的伦敦运输公司拒绝了工人提高工资的要求而引起的。
