Learning Culture, Innovating Technology, Villages Running Night Schools
Hubei Promotes Xiaomiao Township Experience

    This newspaper reports that Hubei Province is actively promoting the experience of Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County in establishing cultural and technical night schools. Thousands upon thousands of night schools have already opened and are in session. These schools can enable the broad masses of farmers to quickly master cultural and scientific knowledge, promote agricultural technology reform, enrich farmers' cultural lives, raise political awareness, and promote a great leap forward in agricultural production. Tianmen County has established more than 6,800 cultural and technical night schools, with 150,000 participants. In places such as Huchang Township in Dangyang County, Chiba District in Jianli County, and Daoguan District in Songzi County, more than 700 cultural and technical night schools have been established, with more than 20,000 participants. In Macheng County, the number of participants will reach 200,000. The Jingzhou Special District, where Tianmen County is located, plans to establish cultural and technical night schools in the production teams of each agricultural cooperative within two years.

    Currently, night schools in various places are widely offering technical courses in seed selection, seed soaking, rice seedling cultivation, prevention of seedling rot, and the production of nutrient bowls and granular fertilizer, combined with production. The students learn and then immediately apply what they have learned, which has greatly contributed to production. Tianmen County combines night schools with experimental field cultivation, and culture with technology. Most of the cultural and technical night schools in the county have planted experimental fields. Members of the Jienan Second Cooperative in Jienan Township learned the technique of applying base fertilizer to cotton ditches in the night school and then practiced it in the experimental fields. In this way, many cooperative members mastered this technique. After studying at the night school, the youths of Hongqi Eighth Cooperative in Hongqi Township, Guangji County, established youth experimental rice seedling fields in each team, realizing the new-style rice seedling field throughout the cooperative. After three days of study, thirty young people from the Yanjiang Cooperative in Lanpu Township, Jianli County, learned the general techniques of the ten major measures for cotton planting. In order to truly integrate culture and technology, various places have also conducted technical training for teachers of people's schools.

    Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County has a history of more than three years in establishing cultural and technical night schools. Initially, the Communist Youth League branch of the Dengta Third Cooperative in the township established a "Three Members" (technician, accountant, farm implement staff) night school to meet the technical learning needs of young people. This method was very popular among young people, and several nearby cooperatives successively established several youth technical night schools. Because the courses in the technical night schools could be immediately applied to production after being learned, young people who were originally studying in people's schools went to the technical night schools, causing many people's schools to collapse; a conflict arose between learning culture and learning technology. According to the demands of the masses, the township Party branch properly resolved this problem: it merged the people's schools with the technical night schools, renamed them youth cultural and technical night schools, and compiled a set of cultural and technical textbooks under the leadership of the deputy secretary of the Party branch. Their method is: learn technology according to the needs of production, and learn culture in order to master technology; learn to read whatever characters you need to use for whatever you are doing. In this way, you remember the characters firmly, learning technology can improve production, and everyone says it is good, with men, women, old and young alike flocking to the night schools. The number of night schools increased from six to sixty-six, with the appearance of "old men's classes," "grandma classes," and three generations of grandparents and grandchildren attending night school together. The original youth technical night schools had to remove the word "youth" and were renamed cultural and technical night schools. Now, this atmosphere of learning has spread throughout all villages and cooperatives in Xiaomiao Township, with each team running schools, everyone learning culture, and everyone delving into technology.

    The reason why Xiaomiao Township's cultural and technical night schools are popular among farmers is that learning is closely integrated with production, theory is combined with practice, and what is learned is applied. Each night school has its own experimental field. After learning technology at night, they go to the fields to work practically during the day. Xiaomiao Township is a cotton-producing area. Through the education of the night schools, a complete set of advanced technical knowledge and operating methods for cotton production has been mastered by every worker, and many people can explain some scientific principles. The students learn advanced technologies while doing them, and after successful experiments, they are promoted throughout the township, greatly promoting production. In 1953, the township's average yield of ginned cotton per mu was 20 jin. In 1956, it won the title of "Hundred Jin Cotton Township." Last year, despite suffering from severe disasters, it still achieved an average yield of 110 jin of ginned cotton per mu. This year, the township has nearly 2,000 mu of experimental fields, some of which are planned to produce 3,000 jin of seed cotton per mu, and some want to create the world's number one field and break the world cotton production record.

    Many people have learned to read and removed their illiteracy through night school studies. Farmers say: In the past, they were blind, but today they can see the world (read newspapers). Now, 114 newspaper reading groups have been established throughout the township, reading newspapers regularly; there are also 15 clubs, 28 writing groups, and 418 actors, who regularly write, perform, sing, and enjoy themselves. In today's Xiaomiao Township, if you ask about production technology? Walk around the township, and everyone from teenagers to men in their seventies can tell you a lot. Want to see cultural activities? Girls can tie red and green silk ribbons around their waists at any time, sing, and dance; every day at dusk, men and women, old and young, grandparents and grandchildren, with schoolbags in hand, smile and go to school.

    Now, the Party organization of Xiaomiao Township is preparing to further establish agricultural middle schools and mass amateur agricultural colleges on the basis of cultural and technical night schools, leading the farmers of the township to march towards science and technology, realize the technical revolution, and gradually modernize agricultural production.

    学习文化　革新技术　村村办夜校
    湖北各地推广小庙乡经验
    本报讯　湖北省各地在积极推广该省天门县小庙乡创办文化技术夜校的经验，成千上万所夜校已经开学上课。这种学校可以使广大农民迅速掌握文化科学知识，推动农业技术改革，丰富农民的文化生活，提高政治觉悟，促进农业生产的大跃进。天门县已创办文化技术夜校六千八百多所，参加学习的有十五万人。当阳县胡场乡、监利县尺八区、松滋县道观区等地，已创办文化技术夜校七百多所，参加学习的有二万多人。麻城县参加学习的将达二十万人。天门县所在的荆州专区，计划在两年内各农业社的生产队都要建立文化技术夜校。
    目前各地夜校正结合生产广泛开讲选种、浸种、办秧田、防止烂秧和制营养钵、颗粒肥等技术课。学员们学了就干，对生产起了很大作用。天门县把夜校与种试验田结合起来，文化与技术结合起来，该县绝大部分文化技术夜校都种了试验田，界南乡界南二社的社员们在夜校里学习了棉花沟施底肥技术，又到试验田做了一遍，这样，许多社员都掌握了这项技术。广济县红旗乡红旗八社青年在夜校学习后，队队青年都办了青年试验秧田，使全社实现了新式秧田化。监利县蓝铺乡沿江社三十个青年，经三天学习，就有十五人学到了植棉十大措施的一般技术。为使文化与技术真正结合，各地还对民校教师进行了技术训练。
    天门县小庙乡创办文化技术夜校已有三年多的历史，起初是该乡灯塔三社团支部为满足青年学习技术的要求，创办了一所“三员”（技术员、会计员、农具员）夜校。这办法很受青年欢迎，附近几个社也相继办了几所青年技术夜校。因为技术夜校的课程学了之后，能够立即用之于生产，原在民校学习的青年都纷纷到技术夜校去，使许多民校垮了台；学文化和学技术发生了矛盾，该乡党支部根据群众的要求，妥善地解决了这个问题：把民校同技术夜校合并起来，改称青年文化技术夜校，并在党支部副书记的领导下，编了一套文化技术课本。他们的办法是：根据生产的需要学技术，为了掌握技术学文化；做什么事，认什么字。这样认字记的牢，学了技术能提高生产，人人都说好，男女老少一齐往夜校里涌。夜校由六所一下发展到六十六所，出现了“老头班”“婆婆班”、祖孙三代一同上夜校。原来的青年技术夜校不得不把“青年”二字去掉，改名为文化技术夜校。现在，这种学习的风气在小庙乡遍及各村各社，队队办学校，人人学文化，个个钻技术。
    小庙乡文化技术夜校所以受农民欢迎，是因为学习紧密结合生产，理论结合实际，学以致用。每所夜校都有自己的试验田，夜晚学了技术，白天就下地实干。小庙乡是棉产区，经过夜校的教育，棉花生产的一套先进的技术知识和操作方法已为每个劳动者所掌握，许多人都能讲些科学道理。学员们对先进技术边学边干，试验成功了就在全乡推广，大大推进了生产。1953年该乡平均亩产皮棉二十斤，1956年获得皮棉百斤乡称号，去年虽然遭受严重灾害，仍能达平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤。今年全乡有近二千亩试验田，有的规划亩产籽棉三千斤，有的要创造天下第一田，要打破世界棉产纪录。
    许多人经过夜校学习，识了字摘掉了文盲帽子。农民说：过去都是睁眼瞎，今天一眼看天下（读报）。现在全乡建立了一百一十四个读报组，经常读报；还有十五个俱乐部，二十八个创作组，四百一十八个演员，经常自编自演，自唱自乐。在今天的小庙乡，你要问生产技术吗？走遍全乡，从十多岁的少年到七十多岁的老汉，个个都能说出一大套。要看文化活动吗？姑娘们可随时把红绿绸带子往腰上一扎，唱起来，跳起来；每天一到黄昏，男男女女，老老少少，祖孙三代，夹着书包，含笑上学堂。
    现在，小庙乡的党组织准备在文化技术夜校的基础上，进一步建立农业中学和群众性的业余农学院，领导全乡农民向科学技术进军，实现技术革命，使农业生产逐渐现代化。（附图片）
