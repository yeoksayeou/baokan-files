    War Hysteria

    If (the United States) is suddenly bombed by the enemy, you don't have to worry about the problem of letters. The Post Office has already considered it for you. Postmaster General Summerfield has requested an appropriation of $250,000 to purchase 125 million change-of-address cards for use in emergencies.

    Postal officials explained that they plan to store these cards in dangerous areas and distribute them to evacuees to fill out during air raids. This card serves a dual purpose: it maintains the flow of mail and facilitates relatives and friends finding the whereabouts of evacuees. — U.S. "New York Post"

    战争歇斯底里
    如果（美国）突然受到敌人轰炸，你不必为信件的问题担忧。邮政部早已替你考虑好了。邮政总长萨末菲尔德要求拨款二十五万美元购置一亿二千五百万张改变地址的卡片，以便在紧急时期备用。
    邮政部的官员解释说，他们计划将这些卡片存放在各危险地区，在空袭时分发给疏散者填写。这种卡片有双重作用，既可维持信件流通，又可便利亲友寻找逃难者的下落。——美国“纽约邮报”
