Editorial Notes:

    Grasp Both Ends
    The Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, while developing local industry, continues to strengthen its leadership over state-owned industry. This approach correctly embodies the Party's policy of promoting both central and local industries, and both large and small-to-medium enterprises simultaneously.
    It is a matter of course for local Party committees to pay attention to leading local industry. However, strengthening leadership over state-owned industry is also the unshirkable responsibility of local Party committees. This is because: Firstly, state-owned industry is the backbone of the national economy, and we must run it well. Although many of these factories are under the direct leadership of the central government in terms of operations, the central government is, after all, relatively far from the factories. Relying on local Party committees to care for, assist, and supervise these factories in their daily work, especially in political matters, is still the primary method. Secondly, state-owned industry and local industry, large enterprises and small-to-medium enterprises, these two aspects inseparably constitute the whole of the national economy. To ensure that these two aspects closely cooperate and promote each other, rather than being disjointed or even mutually offsetting strengths, it is even more necessary for local Party committees to provide unified leadership, doing the work of comprehensive balancing and organizational coordination.
    At present, Party committees in various localities are gradually shifting their focus of leadership towards industry. We hope that these Party committees, while grasping local industry, will also grasp state-owned industry, just like the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee.

    两头都要抓
    西安市委在发展地方工业的同时，继续加强对国营工业的领导。这种做法正确地体现了党关于中央工业与地方工业同时并举、大型企业与中小型企业同时并举的方针。
    地方党委注意领导地方工业，这是天经地义的事情。但是，加强对国营工业的领导，对地方党委来说，也是责无旁贷的。因为：第一、国营工业是国民经济的骨干，我们一定要把它办好。其中许多工厂虽然在业务上归中央直接领导，但是，中央毕竟离工厂比较远，在日常工作上，特别是在政治上关心、帮助和监督这些工厂，还是主要依靠地方党委。第二、国营工业和地方工业，大型企业和中小型企业，这两个方面不可分割地构成国民经济的整体。要使这两个方面密切配合、互相促进，而不是彼此脱节、甚至互相抵销力量，那就更需要地方党委把它们统一领导起来，做综合平衡和组织协作的工作。
    现在各地党委都正在把领导重心逐渐转向工业方面。我们希望这些党委在抓地方工业的同时，像西安市委一样，也要抓国营工业。
