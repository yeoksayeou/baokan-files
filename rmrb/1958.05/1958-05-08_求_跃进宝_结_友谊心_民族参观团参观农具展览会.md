Seeking “Leap Forward Treasures” to Forge “Friendship Hearts”
    Ethnic Minority Visiting Groups Visit Agricultural Tool Exhibition
    (Xinhua News Agency) Seven ethnic minority visiting groups, comprising members from more than thirty ethnic groups, visited the Agricultural Tool Exhibition yesterday.

    The ethnic minority members were particularly interested in the various new agricultural tools and transportation equipment suitable for mountainous areas. In the Sichuan visiting group, Ze Xi (Tibetan) was reluctant to leave each new agricultural tool. She took notes and explained to her companions in Tibetan. Wang Siming (Buyi), Deputy Secretary of the County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Huishui County, Guizhou Province, had already filled his notebook with drawings. He said that they had two wishes in coming to Beijing: one was to seek "Leap Forward Treasures," and the other was to forge "Friendship Hearts" with all fraternal ethnic groups. Li Minghua (Yao), from the Dayaoshan area of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, was a farmer who had never left Dayaoshan. He touched every tractor he saw. He said that he would never forget two things about his trip to Beijing: one was seeing Chairman Mao, which made him so excited that he couldn't sleep that night, and the other was seeing so many machines made by the advanced Han elder brothers today. He said, "I will work harder when I go back. The progress of our ethnic minorities depends not only on our own hard work, but also on the help of our Han elder brothers."
    These seven ethnic minority visiting groups came from Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Guangdong, Gansu, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, totaling more than three hundred people.

    求“跃进宝”结“友谊心”
    民族参观团参观农具展览会
    据新华社讯　包括三十多个民族成份的七个民族参观团昨天参观了农具展览会。
    各少数民族团员们对各种各样的新式农具和适用山区的运输工具，特别感到兴趣。在四川参观团的行列里，泽西（藏族）走到每件新式农具面前时都舍不得离开，她一面做笔记，一面用藏语向同伴解说。贵州惠水县的中共县委副书记王思明（布依族）的笔记本上已经画满了图样。他说他们到北京来有两个愿望，一是求“跃进宝”；二是和各兄弟民族结“友谊心”。广西僮族自治区大瑶寨区的黎明华（瑶族）是个从没走出过大瑶寨的农民，他走到每一种拖拉机面前都要摸一摸。他说他这次到北京有两件事是他一生难忘的，一是见到了毛主席，当天晚上兴奋得没有睡着觉，再就是今天看到先进的汉族老大哥做出这么多的机器。他说：“我回去后更要加劲地干，我们少数民族要进步，除了自己努力干，还要靠汉族老大哥的帮助。”
    这七个民族参观团来自四川、云南、贵州、湖南、广东、甘肃和广西僮族自治区等地，共三百多人。
