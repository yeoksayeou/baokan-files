    In the Da zu County demonstration and breeding farm in Sichuan province, there is a “Wheat King.” This wheat plant, grown from a single seed of the improved wheat variety "Hechang No. 45," is three feet eight inches tall, and more than seven inches thick. It requires two hands to encircle it. It has ninety-six branches, each bearing heavy ears of wheat. The longest ear is five and a half inches long, and most are four and a half inches long. Among the ninety-six ears, the one with the most grains has one hundred and fifteen grains, and the fewest has sixty grains. Eighty-two ears have more than ninety grains. The entire plant has more than eight thousand grains, weighing about half a catty (approximately 0.55 lbs). Upon closer inspection, this wheat plant has some differences from ordinary wheat. Ordinary wheat ears have small spikelets on only eighteen to twenty spikelet nodes, while it has small spikelets on up to twenty-eight spikelet nodes. In addition, twenty-three of its ears have "babies" on the small spikelets, bearing multiple spikes. Everyone who has seen this wheat plant says in unison that it is no wonder it grows so much wheat. It truly is an unprecedented "Wheat King."
    On the 21st, the Da zu County Committee of the Communist Party of China invited Tang De'an, an old farmer with fifty-four years of farming experience; Zhou Yi, Lei Mao, and Mao Yizhong, three technicians who have both farmed and attended agricultural schools; and Luo Jinyuan, the worker who planted this wheat plant, to conduct an on-site appraisal and study the reasons for its growth.
    Luo Jinyuan introduced that this wheat plant grew from a single wheat seed he sowed next to winter amaranth when planting winter amaranth on September 1st last year. At that time, Luo Jinyuan and several other vegetable workers discussed: Old farmers say, "Rice seedlings grow nine shoots, wheat seedlings grow countless," how many offspring can a single wheat seed produce? Let's try it out, shall we? So they buried a wheat seed in the vegetable field.
    After Luo Jinyuan explained in detail his cultivation process for this wheat plant, the old farmer Tang De'an and agricultural technicians Zhou Yi, Lei Mao, and Mao Yizhong conducted repeated discussions. They believe that the main reasons why this "Wheat King" was able to grow up are that the improved variety was sown in fertile vegetable soil, and the base fertilizer was applied thickly, coupled with Luo Jinyuan's excellent fertilization methods. In the early stage of wheat growth, he applied light concentrations of fertilizer multiple times and in small amounts, which was easy for the wheat seedlings to absorb. Subsequently, according to the increased fertilizer needs of the wheat, he increased the fertilizer, using half water and half manure. Everyone then analyzed and said that Luo Jinyuan's excellent field management work was also a reason. Before sowing, he dug the soil twice as deep as usual tilling, and dug it loosely, without any clods, which facilitated the wheat's tillering. They estimated that the tillering of this wheat plant has already reached the stage of father producing son, son producing grandson, and grandson producing great-grandson. In the later stage, Luo Jinyuan strengthened the soil consolidation work, making the contact between the soil and the roots closer. Therefore, the plant is compact, the stalks are tightly rooted, and the distribution is concentrated. Its roots are radial, the area occupied is not wide, and the stalks are hard. Therefore, although it is a single plant, it has not lodged. Luo Jinyuan usually pulls out weeds as soon as he sees them next to it, to prevent the weeds from taking away the wheat's nutrients and blocking its sunlight.
    Based on the opinions expressed by everyone, Zhou Yi explained the reasons for the occurrence of this "miracle." He said that since this wheat plant was sown in September, more than a month earlier than the local general wheat sowing time, it had sufficient time to tiller, and the development and growth period were very sufficient, and the nutrients were also sufficient. The sunshine period was also longer, which promoted the rapid formation of organic matter inside the wheat and enhanced the assimilation effect, accumulating a lot of nutrients. He went on to say that it also grew in a low winter amaranth field, so the air circulation was very good, enhancing the wheat's ability to assimilate carbon dioxide. In the early stage of planting to the small spikelet differentiation stage, a lot of fertilizer was applied, accelerating differentiation. The nature of wheat is to have multiple spikes, so this formed a wheat plant with many spikelet nodes, large ears, small spikelets on all spikelet nodes, and "babies" on the small spikelets of some ears, resulting in multiple spikes on small spikelets. He calculated: According to the local average of 17,000 wheat plants per mu (approximately 0.16 acres), if the amount of seeds used is controlled, and it is calculated at 7,000 plants per mu, each mu will yield 3,500 catties (approximately 3,858 lbs).

### “小麦王”

    “小麦王”
    新华社记者  龚成华
    在四川省大足县示范繁殖场里，有一株“小麦王”。这株由一粒“合场四十五号”小麦良种长成的麦子，高三尺八寸，粗七寸多，要用两只手才能把它?拢来。它有九十六个分枝，每个枝上都结有沉甸甸的麦穗，最长的穗有五寸五，一般的都是四寸五分长。在九十六个穗上，麦粒长得最多的穗有一百一十五颗麦粒，最少的也有六十颗，九十颗以上的有八十二个穗。全株共有八千多颗麦粒，约重半斤。仔细看看这株麦子，发现它与一般麦子还有一些不同。一般麦穗只有十八到二十个穗节上有小穗，而它最多的有二十八个穗节上有小穗。此外，它有二十三个穗的小穗上都背有“娃娃”，生有重穗，凡是看过这株麦子的人，都异口同声地说，难怪它长出这样多的麦子，真是没有见过的“小麦王”。
    中共大足县委在21日邀集有五十四年农活经验的老农唐德安，三个既种过庄稼又进过农业学校的技术员周艺、雷懋、毛义仲，以及栽种这株麦子的工人罗金元，共同对它进行现场鉴定，研究它长成的原因。
    罗金元介绍说，这株麦子是他去年9月1日种冬苋菜时在菜旁播下的一粒麦种长成的。当时罗金元和另外几个蔬菜工人商量：老农民说“秧发九只，麦发无数”，究竟一粒麦子能生出好多崽子，我们来试一试好不好？于是他们就把一粒麦种埋在蔬菜地里。
    罗金元详细说明他对这粒麦子的培育过程后，老农唐德安和农业技术员周艺、雷懋、毛义仲进行了反复讨论。他们认为这株“小麦王”所以能够成长起来的原因，主要是良种播在土壤肥沃的蔬菜地里，底肥又施得厚，加以罗金元的施肥方法很好。他在麦子生长前期，多次少量施用浓度很轻的肥料，便于麦苗吸收；继后，根据麦子需肥增多的情况，他就加重肥料，一半水一半粪。大家接着分析说道，罗金元的田间管理工作做得很好也是一个原因。播种前，他把泥土挖得比一般锄土深一倍，又挖得松，没有一块泥巴，这就便于麦子发兜。他们估计，这株麦子发枝已经到父生子，子生孙，孙生曾孙的情况了。而在后期，罗金元又加强了培土工作，使土壤和根部的接触更加紧密，因此植株紧凑，麦秆扎得很紧，而且分布集中。它的根部呈辐射状，占地面积也不宽，麦秆又硬，所以虽然孤独一株，但是没有倒伏。罗金元平时一看见它旁边有杂草就扯，以免野草夺走麦子的养料，遮住它的阳光。
    周艺根据大家发表的意见，解释了这个“奇迹”发生的原因，他说，由于这株麦子是在9月播种的，比当地一般麦子下种早一个多月，使它有充分时期发兜，发育和生长的时期都很充分，养料又足。日照时期也因此较长，这就促进麦子内部有机物迅速形成，同化作用增强，积累的养份很多。他接着说，加以它又是长在矮小的冬苋菜地里，这样空气很流通，增强了小麦对二氧化碳的同化能力。在栽种前期到小穗分化期，施肥很多，加快分化，小麦本性又是具有复穗的，因此形成这株麦子穗节多、麦穗大、穗节上都有小穗，部分麦穗的小穗上又背上一个“小娃娃”，出现小穗重穗。他计算：按照当地一亩麦子现在是一万七千窝，如果控制用种量，以种七千窝计算，每亩就要打三千五百斤。（附图片）
