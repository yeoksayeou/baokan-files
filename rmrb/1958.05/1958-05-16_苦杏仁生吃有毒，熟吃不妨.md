Why

    Bitter Almonds Are Poisonous When Eaten Raw, But Safe When Cooked
    Currently, there are two types of almonds used to make almond tea and almond porridge: one is the non-toxic sweet almond, and the other is the bitter almond which contains cyanide. Because bitter almonds are cheaper, they are generally used for manufacturing. Bitter almonds contain hydrocyanic acid, which is extremely poisonous. If a child eats seven or eight raw bitter almonds, it can be fatal. However, why is it not poisonous after being made into tea or porridge? It turns out that after the bitter almonds are ground and heated, the toxins in them will hydrolyze in the pot and turn into gas that evaporates. Even so, it is best not to use bitter almonds to make tea or porridge. (Yao)

    苦杏仁生吃有毒，熟吃不妨
    目前制造杏仁茶、杏仁粥的杏仁有两种：一种是无毒的甜杏仁，一种是含有氰化物的苦杏仁。因为苦杏仁便宜，所以一般采用它来制造。苦杏仁里含有氢氰酸，极毒。如果一个小孩生吃苦杏仁七、八枚，就会毒死。可是制成茶、粥吃后却不会中毒，为什么呢？原来苦杏仁被磨碎加温后，其中毒素就会在锅中水解，化成气体挥发了。虽然这样，我们最好还是不要用苦杏仁来制茶制粥。　（尧）
