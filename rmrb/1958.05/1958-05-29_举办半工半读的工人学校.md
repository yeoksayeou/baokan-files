    The news published in today's newspaper about the opening of the work-study school at the Tianjin State-Owned No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory is encouraging! Although the school is just starting, with a small number of students and incomplete conditions, it represents a new beginning. Just as agricultural middle schools are the main form of training peasants to become intellectuals, this type of work-study worker school is an important form of training workers to become intellectuals. It represents a new direction in the development of our country's education, and it is an important way to cultivate working-class intellectuals in a faster, better, and more economical way. This approach is very beneficial to our country's socialist construction and deserves great promotion!
    Establishing work-study schools attached to factories has very urgent practical significance. It can accelerate the training of a large number of working-class intellectuals. Now, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, our country's socialist construction is experiencing a great period of "one day equals twenty years," and industrial and agricultural production are leaping forward by leaps and bounds, and the technological revolution and cultural revolution have begun. This new situation presents us with an urgent task - to build a team of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals, including the training of a large number of both red and expert technical cadres. To build such a team, on the one hand, it is necessary to transform the original intellectuals; more importantly, it is necessary to adopt revolutionary methods to train a large number of new working-class intellectuals. Selecting outstanding industrial workers from factories and enterprises to participate in learning and improve their cultural and scientific knowledge is a practical and feasible method for training a team of working-class intellectuals, and it is also an important aspect of implementing the class line in training cadres.
    Why are work-study schools attached to factories and mining enterprises more practical and feasible than other methods? This is because in the case of work-study, workers spend half a day or several hours each day participating in production and half a day or several hours participating in learning, which does not affect production or the workers' lives. Workers can learn production techniques in production practice and acquire scientific and cultural knowledge in school. This method also cultivates talent relatively quickly; workers with a general elementary school graduation level can reach high school graduation level in three and a half years. Implementing this method requires very little money from the state, and the enthusiasm of enterprises can be fully utilized. The problem of excessive personnel in some factories and enterprises can also be solved. After some enterprises implement work-study programs, they can also absorb a large number of primary and secondary school graduates, opening up a new avenue for solving their problems of further education and employment. If factories and enterprises across the country with generally suitable conditions do this, they can cultivate a large number of red technical cadres who combine theory and practice in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    We should see that implementing work-study has a more far-reaching significance. With the rapid development of production and construction, the scientific division of labor is becoming increasingly refined. Some workers are fixed in a certain job for a long time, day after day, year after year, which may slowly affect the further development of their enthusiasm. This trend has already been discovered in many factories; some workers are not satisfied with the production technology knowledge they currently possess, and they are eager to further master scientific and cultural knowledge. Many people participate in learning with tenacious spirit. Many textile workers study drawing, radio technology, etc., and are very interested. This situation is worth our attention. Engels had already said in "Principles of Communism": "Industry operated jointly and according to a plan by the whole society presupposes even more people with comprehensively developed talents, people who are able to survey the entire system of production.... Education will enable young people quickly to familiarize themselves with the entire system of production; it will enable them to pass from one branch of production to another according to the needs of society or their own inclinations. It will, therefore, free them from the one-sided character which the present-day division of labor impresses upon every individual. Communist society will, in this way, make it possible for its members to put their comprehensively developed talents to full use." What Engels said here is the direction of communist educational development. In our country's current conditions, the division of labor between people will exist for a long time, and this direction of development is still a relatively distant future for us. The comprehensive development we can achieve now is the combination of production and education, that is, being able to do both physical labor and mental labor; having both cultural education and political and ideological education. Of course, this does not mean that we do not need to consider the future. We must consider both the present and the future, that is, we must also consider how to eliminate the difference between mental and physical labor in the future. Implementing work-study can not only solve the current problem of improving workers' cultural and technical knowledge, but also prepare conditions for comprehensive development in the future. It can enable workers to directly participate in production and engage in physical labor, and also learn cultural knowledge and engage in mental labor. This form already contains communist factors. It will lay a preliminary foundation for eliminating the non-essential difference between physical labor and mental labor in the future.
    Of course, opening work-study schools in factories and enterprises will encounter various difficulties and specific problems. For example: How to solve the problem of teachers? How to pay the wages of work-study workers? How to pay for expenses? How to set up courses? In particular, how to arrange production order? How to organize the labor force? These are urgent problems that need to be solved. The experience of Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory tells us that these problems can be solved. When this factory first started running the work-study school, some people worried that the production order would be disrupted, production would be affected, and workers' wages might be reduced. Therefore, they were timid and repeatedly discussed it among the leaders, and dared not let the workers discuss it. Later, they liberated their minds, considered the problem broadly, recognized the political significance of implementing work-study, and posted enrollment notices, fully mobilizing the masses, and calculated the economic, political, and work accounts. As a result, the number of applicants exceeded more than double their expected number. The workers came up with many ways to arrange the production order, and a series of other specific problems were also solved easily.
    Implementing work-study clearly has its universal significance. It can be implemented not only in factories, but also in government agencies and schools; not only can the state run it, but also the masses can run it; not only can the central ministries run it, but also the local governments can run it; not only can work-study primary and secondary schools be run, but also work-study vocational schools and universities can be run. In particular, newly established institutions of higher learning can consider adopting the work-study format, and the length of study can be appropriately extended. The various work-study schools run by various regions and units should not and cannot be forced to be uniform in terms of time arrangement, curriculum setting, and other specific issues. They should create more complete experiences in practice based on the specific conditions of their own units, and gradually make this form a new form for our country to run education.

### 举办半工半读的工人学校

    举办半工半读的工人学校
    今天本报发表的天津国营第一棉纺织厂半工半读学校开学的新闻，是一个令人鼓舞的好消息！尽管这个学校只是草创，学员人数不多，各项条件还很不完备；但是，这是一个新的露头。正像农业中学是培养农民成为知识分子的主要形式一样，这种半工半读的工人学校是培养工人成为知识分子的重要形式。它代表着我国教育事业发展道路中的一个新的方向，是多快好省地培养工人阶级知识分子的一项重要办法。这种作法，对于我国社会主义建设大有好处，值得大大提倡！
    工厂附设半工半读的学校，具有十分迫切的现实意义。它可以加快步伐培养大批的工人阶级知识分子。现在我们国家在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，社会主义建设事业正经历着“一天等于二十年”的伟大时期，工农业生产正在一日千里地向前跃进，技术革命和文化革命已经开始了。这种新的形势，向我们提出了一个迫不及待的任务——建立一支成千万人的工人阶级的知识分子队伍，其中包括培养大批又红又专的技术干部。要建立这样一支队伍，一方面需要改造原有的知识分子；更重要的是采用革命的方法，培养大批新的工人阶级知识分子。从工厂企业中选拔优秀的产业工人参加学习，提高他们的文化科学知识，就是培养工人阶级知识分子队伍的一个切实可行的方法，也是贯彻执行培养干部的阶级路线的重要方面。
    厂矿企业附设半工半读的学校为什么是比其他方法更切实可行的呢？这是因为在半工半读的情况下，工人每天有半天时间或几小时参加生产，半天或几个小时参加学习，既不影响生产，又不影响工人生活；工人既能在生产实践中学到生产技术，又能在学校中学到科学文化知识。这种办法培养人材的速度也比较快，一般高小毕业程度的工人，三年半就可以达到高中毕业的程度。实行这种办法，国家花钱很少，而企业的积极性却可以充分发挥；有些工厂企业人员过多的问题，也可以随之得到解决；有些企业实行半工半读以后，还可以吸收大批中小学毕业生，为解决他们的升学和就业问题开拓了一条新的道路。如果全国一般条件具备的工厂企业都这样办，就可以多快好省地培养出大批理论与实践相结合的红色的技术干部。
    我们应该看到，实行半工半读，还有它更为深远的意义。随着生产建设的飞跃发展，科学的分工越来越细。有些工人长期固定在一种工作岗位上，日复一日，年复一年，慢慢地可能会影响到他们积极性的进一步发挥。目前许多工厂中已经发现这种苗头；有些工人对于他目前所知道的生产技术知识感到不满足，他们渴望着进一步掌握科学文化知识。许多人用顽强的精神参加了学习。不少纺织工人学习制图、无线电技术等等，兴趣十分浓厚。这种情况很值得我们注意。恩格斯在“共产主义原理”中早已说过：“由整个社会共同地和有计划地来经营的工业就更加需要各方面都有能力的人，即能通晓整个生产体系的人……。教育可使年轻人很快就能够熟悉整个生产系统，它可使他们根据社会的需要或他们自己的爱好，轮流从一个生产部门转到另一个生产部门。因此，教育就会使他们摆脱现代这种分工造成的片面性。这样一来，根据共产主义原则组织起来的社会将使自己的成员能够全面地发挥他们的各方面的才能，而同时各个不同的阶级也就必然消失。”恩格斯这里所说的是共产主义教育发展的方向。在我国的现实条件下，人与人之间的分工还会长期存在，这个发展方向，对我们来说还是较远的未来。我们现在所能做到的全面发展就是生产与教育相结合，就是既能作体力劳动，又能作脑力劳动；既有文化教育，又有政治思想教育。当然，这决不是说，我们就不必考虑到将来。我们既要考虑到目前，也还必须考虑到将来，就是说，也要考虑到将来如何消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。实行半工半读，不但可以解决目前提高工人文化技术知识的问题，而且还可能为将来全面发展准备了条件。它既能够使工人们直接参加生产，从事体力劳动；又能够学习文化知识，从事脑力劳动。这种形式，已经孕育着共产主义的因素。它为将来消灭体力劳动和脑力劳动之间非本质的差别将打下初步的基础。
    当然，在工厂企业中开办半工半读的学校，会遇到各种各样的困难和具体问题。比如：教员如何解决？半工半读工人的工资如何发法？经费如何开支？课程如何设置？特别是生产秩序如何安排？劳动力如何组织？这些是迫切需要解决的问题。天津国棉一厂的经验告诉我们，这些问题都是可以解决的。这个工厂在开始举办半工半读学校的时候，也有些人担心生产秩序会搞乱，生产会受影响，工人的工资可能会减少，因此小手小脚，只是反复地在领导干部中商量，不敢让工人讨论。后来，他们解放了思想，海阔天空地考虑问题，认清了实行半工半读的政治意义，并且贴出招生布告，充分发动群众，算了经济账、政治账和工作账，结果报名人数超过了他们预料人数的一倍以上，工人想出许多办法，使生产秩序得到了安排，其他一系列的具体问题，也都迎刃而解。
    实行半工半读显然有它的普遍意义。这不仅在工厂中可以实行，机关、学校中也可以试办；不仅国家可以办，群众也可以办；不仅中央各部可以办，地方也可以办；不仅可以办半工半读的小学、中学，也可以办半工半读的专科和大学，特别是新办的高等学校，可以考虑采用半工半读的形式，学习期限可以适当延长。各地各单位举办的各种半工半读学校，在时间安排、课程设置等具体问题上，不应该也不可能强求统一，应该根据本单位的具体情况，在实践中创造更完备的经验，逐步使这种形式成为我们国家办教育事业的一种新的形式。
