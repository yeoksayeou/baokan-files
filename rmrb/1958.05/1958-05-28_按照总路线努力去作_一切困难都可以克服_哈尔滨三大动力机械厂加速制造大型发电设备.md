Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 27th. After seeing the closing news of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the 25th, the workers of Harbin Boiler Factory, Turbine Factory, and Electrical Machinery Factory were greatly encouraged. The workers of these three factories, full of energy and confidence, proposed guarantees to manufacture the first set of large thermal power generating equipment for the motherland in the second half of the year.

The Harbin Turbine Factory, which is under construction, decided to make a double leap in construction and production in order to produce turbines ahead of schedule. Zhou Bo-fan, the director of the factory, told reporters: "Adopting the method of completing the two-phase project in one go can shorten the construction period by more than a year. Implementing the measures of producing while building, a 25,000-kilowatt turbine will be successfully trial-produced by the end of this year. This fully shows that as long as we work hard according to the Party's general line for socialist construction, all difficulties can be overcome smoothly."

The Harbin Boiler Factory, which started production in July last year, had already reached the designed targets of the first-phase project in April this year. In order to support the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, this factory will not only manufacture dozens of high and medium-pressure power station boilers this year but also undertake the major task of manufacturing nitrogen fertilizer equipment and petroleum equipment. Under the encouragement of the Party's general line for socialist construction, all the factory's employees are in high spirits and full of energy, guaranteeing that the above-mentioned new products will be successfully trial-produced in June.

The Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory, which provided 34 sets of hydroelectric power generating equipment to more than a dozen hydroelectric power stations in our country during the First Five-Year Plan period, will produce 1.03 million kilowatts of hydroelectric and thermal power generating equipment and electric motors this year. This capacity is almost ten times higher than the factory's output in its first year of production. Based on the current situation of vigorously developing hydroelectric power stations in various places in the next two years, the employees of the Harbin Electrical Machinery Factory proposed that the factory's production capacity of hydroelectric power generating equipment next year should be increased three times more than this year.

    按照总路线努力去作
    一切困难都可以克服
    哈尔滨三大动力机械厂加速制造大型发电设备
    据新华社哈尔滨27日电　哈尔滨锅炉厂、汽轮机厂、电机厂的职工们在25日看到中共八大二次会议闭幕消息以后，受到了巨大的鼓舞。这三个厂的职工干劲十足、信心百倍地提出保证，要在下半年为祖国制造出第一套大型的火力发电设备。
    正在建设的哈尔滨汽轮机厂为了提前生产汽轮机，决定建设、生产双跃进。这个厂的厂长周伯藩对记者说：“工厂采用两期工程一次建成的办法，可以缩短工期一年多；实行边生产、边建设的措施，二万五千瓩的汽轮机将可以在今年年底试制成功。这充分说明，只要按照党的建设总路线努力做去，一切困难都可以顺利克服。”
    去年7月投入生产的哈尔滨锅炉厂，今年4月份的产量就已经达到了第一期工程设计的指标。为了支援工农业生产大跃进，这个厂今年不仅制造几十台高、中压电站锅炉，而且担负了制造氮肥设备、石油设备的重大任务。在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，全厂职工心情愉快，精力充沛，保证上述新产品在6月份试制成功。
    在第一个五年计划期间给我国十多座水电站提供了三十四套水力发电设备的哈尔滨电机厂，今年将生产一百零三万瓩的水力、火力发电设备和电动机。这个容量比工厂投入生产第一年的产量几乎增长了十倍。根据目前各地在今、明两年大力发展水电站的情况，哈尔滨电机厂职工提出明年这个厂的水力发电设备的生产能力还要比今年再提高三倍。
