Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Under the instigation of Western countries such as the United States and Britain, Lebanon on the 22nd lodged a "complaint" with the United Nations Security Council, falsely claiming that the United Arab Republic was "interfering" in Lebanon's internal affairs, and demanded that the Security Council hold an emergency meeting to discuss its "complaint."

In recent days, major Western imperialist powers have been instigating the Lebanese authorities to submit a "complaint" to the Security Council regarding the situation in Lebanon, in order to create pretexts for them to further strengthen their intervention. Dulles secretly told the bipartisan leaders of the Senate on the 15th that the United States was "prepared to send armed forces to land in Lebanon," as long as Lebanon complained to the Security Council about so-called foreign "large-scale interference" in the Lebanese situation. British Foreign Secretary Lloyd also said in the House of Commons on the 19th that Western countries were "discussing" the issue of submitting the Lebanese situation to the United Nations.

On the 23rd, the main opposition parties in Lebanon issued a joint statement accusing the pro-Western ruling clique in Lebanon of using the method of "complaining" against the United Arab Republic to create pretexts for Western countries to interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs.

Former Prime Minister Salam refuted at a press conference in Beirut that day the Lebanese government's claim that the people's uprising was the "interference" of the United Arab Republic. He said that the Lebanese people's uprising was a purely national movement.

    黎巴嫩向安理会诬控阿联
    反对党指责美英制造干涉借口
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在美、英等西方国家指使下，黎巴嫩22日向联合国安全理事会提出“控诉”，硬说阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”黎巴嫩内政，并且要求安全理事会举行紧急会议讨论它的“控诉”。
    最近几天以来，西方帝国主义大国一直在教唆黎巴嫩当局就黎巴嫩局势向安理会提出“控诉”，以便为它们进一步加强干涉制造借口。杜勒斯15日秘密告诉参议院两党领袖说，美国“准备派武装部队到黎巴嫩登陆”，只要黎巴嫩向安理会控诉有所谓外国“大规模干涉”黎巴嫩局势。英国外交大臣劳埃德19日在下院答复问题时也说，西方国家在就把黎巴嫩局势提交联合国的问题“进行讨论”。
    黎巴嫩各主要反对党派23日发表了一项联合声明，指责黎巴嫩亲西方统治集团用“控诉”阿拉伯联合共和国的手法来为西方国家干涉黎巴嫩内政制造借口。
    前总理萨拉姆这一天在贝鲁特举行的记者招待会上驳斥了黎巴嫩政府把人民的起义硬说成是阿拉伯联合共和国的“干涉”的说法。他说，黎巴嫩人民的起义是纯粹的民族运动。
