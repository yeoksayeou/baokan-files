Albanian "People's Voice" Publishes Article, Pointing Out that the Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia Concentratedly Expresses Revisionist Views, Aiming to Pave the Way for Capitalist Restoration.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 7th May. The Albanian Labor Party's organ, "People's Voice," recently published an entire international page with an article criticizing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, entitled: "This is Contrary to the Theory and Practice of Marxism-Leninism."

    The main content of the article is to refute the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's arguments that capitalism can automatically evolve into socialism, that the state should wither away, that the dictatorship of the proletariat should be weakened, and to criticize the draft program's fallacy of distorting the current international situation and dividing the unity of socialist countries.

    The article states: The draft program published by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia before the Seventh Congress has many arguments that openly violate the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism, "revise" the fundamental principles of the revolutionary theory of the working class—Marxism-Leninism—and aim to divide the steel-like unity of socialism and the workers' movement.

    The article says that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia brings together the decadent theories of various old and new anti-Marxist schools of thought and dresses them up as "creative Marxism." The draft program attacks the historically significant Moscow Declaration, which expresses the common views of all Marxist-Leninist parties in the world and the unbreakable unity of the socialist camp and the international communist movement. Because the draft program involves issues of the international communist movement, communist and workers' parties of various countries have expressed their opposition to the content of the draft program from the beginning.

    The article says that in the reports and discussions of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia Congress, there were many frantic attacks against socialist countries and their Marxist parties. This is not the same as the "comradely and constructive criticism" that the Yugoslav leaders have repeatedly claimed. At the same time, many defenses were heard at the congress to maintain the Yugoslav theory formulated by the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and trying to make the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the international communist movement follow. Such a congress clearly shows that the Yugoslav leaders are very far from the theory and practice of Marxism-Leninism. The main issue running through the reports and discussions of the congress is the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. In fact, this draft program, under the guise of theory, more clearly expresses all the opportunist and revisionist views that the Yugoslav leaders have shown in the past. In this draft program, they expressed their determination to firmly follow this path and not admit any mistakes. They openly said at the congress, "If anyone expects us to abandon our principled stance on international and internal issues, it is just a waste of time." They want to legitimize anti-Marxist-Leninist and revisionist theories in the theory of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of socialist construction.

    The article refutes the erroneous views in the draft program about capitalism automatically evolving into socialism and the withering away of the state. The article states: "If the argument that capitalism transitions to socialism along an evolutionary path is actually disarming the working class in countries still under capitalist rule, making them stray from the revolutionary path, then the argument about the 'liberalization' of the dictatorship of the proletariat is 'softening' the power of the working class against internal and external enemies, disorienting the working class in socialist countries, and paving the way for capitalist restoration." We heard a lot about the arguments that the state should wither away, the dictatorship of the proletariat should be weakened, and "democratization" and "liberalization" in 1956, when they were widely publicized in many newspapers, speeches, and broadcasts. The Hungarian "Petofi Club" and Nagy also used these views. The whole world sees clearly where these views led Hungary. Kadar emphasized in his report at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that practice is the "judge of the correctness" of ideas and theories, which is completely correct. The life and practice of Hungary proves that weakening the dictatorship of the proletariat and relaxing revolutionary vigilance against class enemies and international imperialism does not favor strengthening socialism, but weakens socialism. These "prescriptions" have become myths currently used by counter-revolutionary forces and bourgeois propagandists to oppose communism and people's power. The Hungarian event is a great lesson for the people of all countries. The Hungarian event actually tells us: it is dangerous and revisionist and anti-Marxist to demand the weakening of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    The article refutes the absurd claim in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that some socialist countries may exploit other socialist countries, and refutes the draft program's slander of the Soviet Union's leading role in the socialist camp. The article states that these arguments are intended to provoke the remnants of national chauvinistic sentiments among the people of socialist countries, to cultivate "national communist" ideas, and to say that it is an internationalist line. But this theory has been exposed. Guided by the principle of proletarian internationalism, the countries of the socialist camp have established and strengthened their relations on this solid foundation, cooperating closely with each other like members of a big family, and providing fraternal and selfless mutual assistance.

    When talking about the international situation, the article criticizes the claim made at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that "Stalin's diplomacy" was the basic reason for the emergence of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

    The article emphasizes that the claim made by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that the international workers' movement is weakening does not conform to reality. As emphasized by the Moscow Conference, the international communist movement has made great progress. But the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have not seen this reality. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia's erroneous statement actually wants to belittle the role of communist and workers' parties and deny the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and its great experience.

    The article then talks about the so-called issue of interference in Yugoslavia's internal affairs. The article says: There is a question to be clarified here: It is very surprising that many times when one of our Marxist-Leninist parties correctly criticizes a position of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in a comradely manner, it is considered interference in internal affairs, unprincipled disputes, etc. However, the Yugoslav leaders or publications interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and suggest which leader is "good" and should be rehabilitated, or that this one is a "Stalinist" and should be dismissed, but claim that this is "comradely criticism." Where is the equality and mutual respect that has been repeatedly mentioned at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia? Or is it just malicious propaganda? Does Yugoslavia have the right to comment on the activities of communist and workers' parties in its program and congress, openly attack and criticize these parties, distort the relations between them, and expound all views that violate Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, and say that this is "comradely" and "constructive," or even a "contribution to the treasure trove of Marxism-Leninism," while we these parties do not have the right to publicly state why we did not participate in the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, why we do not agree with the evaluation of the international workers' movement, the international situation and the relations between the people of various countries, and some theoretical issues in the draft program, and are even considered to have interfered in Yugoslavia's internal affairs? It is very clear that after a series of efforts made by the Soviet Union and other countries to improve relations, it is unfounded for the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia to pretend to be innocent victims. None of us had thought about it, and do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of Yugoslavia or any country, but no Marxist can remain silent or tolerate the idea of ​​Marxism coexisting with revisionism on the ideological front. Every communist has an obligation to vigorously, publicly, and unreservedly crush every anti-Marxist revisionist view, no matter who publishes it, especially when these views are unprecedentedly concentrated in the program of a ruling party that takes socialist construction as its task.

    The article points out that the communist and workers' parties of various countries criticize the anti-Marxist views in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the reports of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in order to defend Marxism-Leninism. If the many principled issues that are being criticized are exactly the same as those criticized in 1948, it shows that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia still stands on the same position on these issues as in 1948, and the communist and workers' parties have opposed this position in the past and now.

    The article finally points out that the views on many issues discussed at the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia show that these are not small differences as the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia said, but completely a question of an anti-Marxist-Leninist revisionist stance.

    阿尔巴尼亚“人民之声报”著文指出
    南共纲领集中表现修正主义观点
    目的是为资本主义复辟开辟道路
    新华社地拉那7日电  阿尔巴尼亚劳动党机关报“人民之声报”最近以国际版整版的篇幅发表了一篇批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的文章，题目是：“这是同马克思列宁主义的理论和实践相违背的”。
    文章主要内容是驳斥南共纲领草案关于资本主义可以自动进化到社会主义、国家应该消亡、无产阶级专政应该削弱等论点以及批判纲领草案歪曲当前国际形势、分化社会主义各国团结的谬论。
    文章写道：南共在第七次代表大会以前所发表的纲领草案中有很多论点是公开违反马克思列宁主义的理论和实践的，是“修正”了工人阶级的革命理论——马克思列宁主义——的根本原则，目的在于分化社会主义和工人运动的钢铁般的团结。
    文章说，南共纲领草案汇集了新旧各种反马克思主义流派的腐朽理论，并且把它们装扮成为“创造性的马克思主义”。纲领草案攻击表达了全世界所有马克思列宁主义政党的共同观点和表达了社会主义阵营、国际共产主义运动牢不可破的团结的具有历史意义的莫斯科宣言。由于纲领草案牵涉到国际共产主义运动的问题，所以各国共产党和工人党从一开始就表示反对纲领草案的内容。
    文章说，在南共代表大会的报告和讨论中有不少反对社会主义国家和它们的马克思主义政党的疯狂攻击。这是同南斯拉夫的领导者们曾经多次宣称的“同志式的和建设性的批评”并不相同的。同时在大会上听到了很多辩护，用以维护南共纲领草案所制定并企图让南共和国际共产主义运动遵循的南斯拉夫理论。这样一种代表大会清楚地说明了南斯拉夫领导者们同马克思列宁主义的理论和实践距离得很远。贯串在代表大会的报告和讨论中的主要问题是通过南共纲领草案。实际上这个纲领草案是以理论为幌子，更明显地表现了南斯拉夫的领导者们过去所表现出的一切机会主义和修正主义观点。他们在这个纲领草案中表示了坚决走这条道路、不承认任何错误的决心。他们在代表大会上公开说，“如果任何方面有人期待我们放弃我们在国际问题和内部问题上的原则性立场的话，这只是浪费时间”。他们想使反马克思列宁主义和修正主义的理论在马克思列宁主义理论和社会主义建设实践中合法化。
    文章驳斥了纲领草案中关于资本主义可以自动进化到社会主义和关于国家消亡的错误观点。文章说：“如果说关于资本主义沿着进化道路过渡到社会主义的论点实际上是解除尚在资本主义统治下的国家的工人阶级的武装、使它们远离革命道路的话，那么关于无产阶级专政‘自由化’的论点就是‘软化’工人阶级反对内外敌人的力量，使社会主义国家的工人阶级迷失方向，并且为资本主义复辟开辟道路。”关于国家应该消亡、无产阶级专政应该削弱以及“民主化”、“自由化”的论调，我们在1956年就听过很多遍了，那时在很多报纸、讲演和广播中大规模地宣传了这些，匈牙利的“裴多菲俱乐部”和纳吉也利用过这些观点。全世界都看得很清楚，这些观点使匈牙利走到了什么地步。卡德尔在南共第七次代表大会上的报告中强调实践是思想观点和理论的“正确性的裁判”，这完全正确。匈牙利的生活和实践就证明，削弱无产阶级专政和放松对阶级敌人和国际帝国主义的革命警惕，不是有利于加强社会主义，而是会削弱社会主义。这些“药方”就成了当前反革命势力和资产阶级宣传家为反对共产主义和人民政权所利用的神话。匈牙利事件对各国人民都是一个很大的教训。匈牙利事件实际上告诉我们：要求削弱无产阶级专政是危险的，是修正主义和反马克思主义的。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案关于一些社会主义国家可能剥削另一些社会主义国家的荒谬说法，驳斥了纲领草案对苏联在社会主义阵营中的领导作用的诬蔑。文章说，这些论点是要挑起社会主义各国人民中残余的民族沙文主义情绪，是要培养“民族共产主义”思想，并把它说成是国际主义路线。但是这种理论已经被揭穿了。以无产阶级国际主义原则为指导的社会主义阵营各国在这个稳固的基础上建立了并加强着他们的关系，彼此像一个大家庭中的成员一样紧密合作，兄弟般地、无私地互相援助。
    文章在谈到国际局势问题时，批判了在南共代表大会上提出的关于“斯大林的外交政策”是产生北大西洋公约的基本原因的说法。
    文章强调指出，南共所提出的国际工人运动正在削弱的说法是不符合实际的。正如莫斯科会议所强调的，国际共产主义运动已经有了很大的进展。但是南共领导人并未看到这一现实。南共的错误提法实际是要贬低共产党和工人党的作用，是要否认苏联共产党的领导作用及其伟大的经验。
    文章接着谈到了所谓干涉南斯拉夫内政的问题。文章说：这里有个问题要澄清：很使人惊奇的是，很多次当我们这些马克思列宁主义政党之一以同志式的态度、正确地批评南共的某个立场的时候，它就认为是干涉内政、是无原则的争论等等。然而南斯拉夫领袖们或出版界干涉着别国的内政，并且提示着哪一个领袖是“好的”、应该给予恢复名誉，或者这个是“斯大林分子”、应该革职，却自称这是“同志式的批评”，这里有什么是南共代表大会上所多次说到的平等和互相尊重呢？还只是恶意的宣传呢？难道南共有权利在它的纲领和代表大会上评述共产党和工人党的活动、公开进攻和批评这些党、歪曲它们之间的关系、阐述所有违反马克思列宁主义理论和实践的观点，而且说这是“同志式的”和“建设性的”、甚至是“对马克思列宁主义宝库的贡献”，而我们这些党却没有权利公开说明我们为什么不参加南共第七次代表大会、为什么不同意纲领草案中对国际工人运动、国际形势和各国人民间的关系、以及一些理论问题的估价，而且竟被认为是干涉了南斯拉夫的内政吗？很清楚，在苏联和其他国家为改善关系进行了一系列努力以后，南共领袖们还要扮成无辜的牺牲者，这是没有根据的。我们之中谁也没有想到过、而且也不想去干涉南斯拉夫或任何国家的内政，但是没有一个马克思主义者能够在思想战线上对马克思主义同修正主义共存的观念保持沉默或加以容忍。每一个共产主义者都有义务来大力地、公开地、毫无保留地粉碎每一个反马克思主义的修正主义观点，不管是谁发表的，特别是当这些观点史无前例地集中表现在一个执政的和把建设社会主义作为自己任务的政党的纲领中的时候。
    文章指出，各国共产党和工人党批判南共纲领草案和南共第七次代表大会的报告中的反马克思主义观点，是为了保卫马克思列宁主义。如果所批评的很多原则性问题正是1948年所批评过的那些问题，那就说明了南共在这些问题上还是站在同1948年一样的立场上，而共产党和工人党过去和现在都是反对这种立场的。
    文章最后指出，在南共代表大会上讨论的许多问题的观点说明了这并不像南共领袖们所说的那样是一些小的分歧问题，而完全是一个反马克思列宁主义的修正主义立场的问题。
