　　Everyone Has Ideals, Everyone Dares to Create
　　Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

    Zhejiang, like the rest of the country, has seen a new upsurge in the all-round Great Leap Forward of socialist construction. This upsurge began with agricultural production, promoting an all-round leap forward in various tasks, and in the most recent month or so, it has formed an unstoppable momentum. In terms of water conservancy construction: after hard work last winter and this spring, more than 700,000 various water conservancy projects have been completed. The amount of earth and stone work completed is equal to 184% of the total completed in the eight years since liberation. The drought resistance capacity of more than 25 million mu of paddy fields in the province has reached the point where 9.13 million mu will not experience drought even without rain for more than 70 days, and 8.34 million mu will not experience drought even without rain for 50 to 70 days. The total of these two accounts for 68% of the province's paddy field area, ensuring the needs for planting double-season rice. In terms of manure accumulation: by the end of April, a total of 25.5 billion dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer had been accumulated, averaging 75,000 jin per mu of cultivated land. In addition, the total output of green manure reached about 50 billion jin, averaging more than 4,000 jin per mu. In terms of soil improvement: the province originally had 8.25 million mu of low-yield fields. 7.09 million mu have been improved. A total of 2 million mu were improved in the past four years, and 5.09 million mu were improved in less than half a year last winter and this spring. In terms of agricultural tool reform: more than 400 kinds of agricultural tools have been created and improved, and 1.33 million pieces have been popularized. Many new-style agricultural tools that cost less, are more efficient, and are easy to operate have emerged. In terms of industrial construction: relying on the whole Party and the entire people to run industry, according to preliminary statistics, 4,177 small and medium-sized factories have been established in the province in just over a month. This is three times more than the total number of factories built in the past eight years. On the cultural and educational front: 8,072 agricultural middle schools were established in one month, with 335,000 students; 22,694 technical night schools were established, with 1,532,900 students. People are boldly creating and striving to move upward in socialist construction. Rural and urban areas promote and support each other. Workers, peasants, soldiers, students, merchants, government cadres, urban residents, men, women, old and young, all mobilized together. Throughout April, the rural attendance rate remained above 60% of the total agricultural population. An unprecedented upsurge in socialist construction has been formed.

    The Essence of the Debate on the Speed of Socialist Construction

    The great enthusiasm of the broad masses is the result of the rectification movement, which takes the correct handling of contradictions among the people as its theme. Zhejiang's rectification movement first focused on the struggle against the Rightists, and then on "two oppositions and two comparisons." The struggle against the Rightists resolved the issue of socialist direction and inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses; the "two oppositions and two comparisons" movement is resolving the issue of understanding the socialist construction line and working methods, and improving the relationship between people, especially between leaders and the masses, which promotes the continuous upsurge of the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses.

    In the rectification movement and the struggle against the Rightists, great victories were achieved in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. At the same time, the Party organization and cadre ranks were rectified relatively thoroughly, and a group of Rightists were exposed, especially Rightists like Sha Wenhan, Yang Siyi, Peng Ruilin, and Sun Zhanglu who were hidden within the Provincial Party Committee. These people were class dissidents and traitors, and extreme individualists. They echoed the Rightists outside the Party and engaged in localism, revisionism, and other anti-Party and anti-socialist activities. In order to realize their ambition to usurp the Party's leadership, they created chaos within the Party. They picked faults everywhere and used big sticks to beat people. This caused some people within the Party to have the illusion that "the more you do, the more mistakes you make; the less you do, the fewer mistakes you make; and if you do nothing, you make no mistakes," which made it very difficult for the Zhejiang Party organization to implement the Party's various guidelines and tasks. The exposure, criticism, and removal of these Rightists within the Party educated the broad masses of cadres and people with vivid teaching materials, helping them to distinguish between major rights and wrongs and clarify the political direction. This consolidated the Party's leadership and enabled the Party organizations throughout the province to unite more closely and concentrate their efforts to lead the socialist construction movement.

    The development of the "two oppositions and two comparisons" movement, and the study of Chairman Mao's instructions on improving working methods, have pushed the rectification movement to a higher stage.

    Within the Zhejiang Party organization, there has been a debate on the speed of socialist construction for several years. In terms of agricultural production, many comrades believe that a Great Leap Forward is possible with effort. However, some people often criticize the Provincial Party Committee for being "fond of great achievements, eager for success, and impatient," and seize on the average number of years of grain production increases in Zhejiang to insist that it can only increase by 2% to 3% each year. In terms of industrial production, many comrades advocate actively developing industry, but some people regard running industry as very mysterious, emphasizing negative "balance" and "control," and dare not let go of running industry. This year, we seized these opposing sides in the ideological struggle and adopted the method of presenting facts, comparing highs and lows, and finding reasons to mobilize everyone to debate. In the debate on whether grain production can leap forward, the facts show that in 1957, four counties in the province had already increased by more than 60% compared to 1956, and 3.1 million mu had reached more than 800 jin (accounting for more than 10% of the 30 million mu of grain planting area); this shows that a Great Leap Forward in grain production is possible. The facts also show that Huangyan County and Pingyang County, Lin'an County and Qu County have roughly the same natural conditions, but the average yield per mu in Huangyan exceeds Pingyang by more than 200 jin, and the yield per mu in Lin'an also exceeds Qu County by more than 200 jin. Why is there such a big difference? Obviously, it is the result of two different leadership ideologies and two different working methods. Thus, the question is raised: should the increase target be determined according to the average of the past, and the plan be realized without much effort, or should the increase target be determined according to the advanced level, and the leap forward plan be realized through intensive work. At the same time, the backward units were also asked the question: "Under similar conditions, others can do it, why can't you?" Therefore, the essence of the debate on the speed of socialist construction is, in the final analysis, whether to muster up energy and strive for the upstream in the cause of socialist construction, or to be content with the status quo and passively fear difficulties; whether to grasp the direction, the essence, and the mainstream in previous movements, or to attack one point or a few points without considering the rest; whether to enthusiastically cherish and actively support new things and advanced experiences, or to turn a blind eye, demand perfection, and blame. And the most fundamental issue is whether to rely on the masses and rely on the advanced, fully utilizing the wisdom and strength of the masses, or to only see things and not people, blindly believe in oneself, blindly believe in experience, blindly believe in dogma, and not believe in the masses. After Party members and cadres have drawn ideological boundaries on these issues, they have further raised their awareness and mustered up their energy. Working Method of Comparing with the Advanced, Learning from the Advanced, and Catching Up with the Advanced

    To mobilize the broad masses and throw them into the Great Leap Forward, we must also resolutely implement the Party's mass line working method. In the Great Leap Forward, people's mental states include mustering up energy and striving for the upstream; being content with the middle reaches and complacent with a little achievement; shouting slogans of leap forward and just talking without doing; and being passively afraid of difficulties, doubting whether it can be done, and even openly opposing. Therefore, the leap forward indicators were set, but in the early stage of the movement, various specific measures could not keep up. In the province's manure accumulation movement, only 3.6 billion dan of miscellaneous soil fertilizer was accumulated in the four months before late March, averaging only 11,000 jin per mu. At that time, Guantang Township in Haiyan County had already accumulated more than 120,000 jin per mu on average, and the Haiyan County Party Committee required the entire county to "accumulate enough fertilizer to achieve a thousand jin of grain." We seized this advanced model and launched a competition to all counties in the province, and the situation greatly changed. In just one month, the total amount of manure accumulated in the province leaped from 3.6 billion dan to 25.5 billion dan. During the sowing and transplanting season, the Provincial Party Committee seized the technical innovation movement proposed by Shaoxing and Jinyun counties, which focused on promoting advanced cultivation techniques, improving tools, and carrying out technical training, and launched a competition to all counties in the province. In ten days, a mass movement of everyone learning technology and everyone learning culture was formed. Before and after the competition, the province, prefecture, and county successively organized several large-scale visits, studies, and inspections and evaluations. In April, a province-wide inspection of agricultural production combining leaders and the masses was carried out. The masses adopted methods such as large-scale debates, big-character posters, on-site meetings, on-the-spot learning, promotion tables, leap forward flags, wall poems, honor rolls, suggestion books, etc., to commend the advanced, help the backward, exchange experiences, and carry out criticism and self-criticism. Cooperatives compared with cooperatives, townships compared with townships, counties compared with counties, and special districts also compared with special districts. Some units specifically organized forces to collect the advanced experiences of other units; some units posted the indicators, measures, and other relevant materials of other units on the wall, trying every means to catch up with the advanced. In this atmosphere of vying for the lead and catching up with the advanced, the leap forward of production was powerfully promoted, and at the same time, the changes in people's thinking were also promoted. The original advanced units were conscientious and diligent, striving to maintain the honor of being advanced; the original backward units quickly caught up, striving to reverse the situation; and those who were content with the middle reaches also became nervous in the "attack from both front and back." In this way, a wave of "comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced" was formed. The masses said, "If you don't believe it, just look; if you don't understand it, just debate; if you don't know it, just learn; if you learn it, just do it." Cadres also further clarified the idea and working method of "relying on the advanced and relying on the masses."

　　Ideological Liberation and Production Leap Forward are Mutually Cause and Effect

    The development of the movement shows that the liberation of people's thinking promotes the leap forward of production; and the leap forward of production further promotes the progress of people's thinking. The Provincial Party Committee originally planned to realize the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) in five to seven years, achieving an average yield of 800 jin per mu for grain, an average yield of 100 jin per mu for cotton, and an average yield of 200 jin per mu for rapeseed, and reaching 35 million head of live pigs. At the same time, the main aspects of irrigation, cultivation, transportation, and agricultural product processing will be basically mechanized and semi-mechanized, with power stations in every township, and a local industrial network combining large, medium, and small sizes will be built to serve agriculture. Primary and secondary education will be popularized, illiteracy will be eliminated, and scientific and technological research will be carried out. However, the broad masses and cadres, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, have become bolder and proposed to work hard for three years to achieve the main indicators stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) and basically change the face of Zhejiang. What they yearn for is the beautiful prospect of "grain full of granaries, factories all over urban and rural areas, everyone has culture, everyone has a thousand jin of grain." They are no longer willing to be slaves to nature, but want to go up the mountains and down the seas, march towards the earth, and march towards science and culture, becoming the masters of nature. Chairman Mao's instructions, the people's soaring enthusiasm, and practical experience all enlighten us: to strive for a greater leap forward in socialist construction, we must have the communist style of daring to dream and daring to act. We must seize the correct direction and constantly put forward revolutionary tasks. So that people do not miss the past, but believe in the future; do not look left and right, hesitate to move, and bind themselves, but boldly imagine, boldly experiment, persevere, and move forward bravely.

    Chairman Mao's instructions on continuous revolution, breaking superstitions, ideological liberation, and the socialist construction line have extremely far-reaching and incalculable significance for the development of China's communist cause. These instructions are like launching a hydrogen bomb that opens the door of wisdom, greatly encouraging people to dare to dream and dare to create. In the past, we relied on the revolutionary creativity of the broad masses to achieve many victories in revolutionary work and construction work; today, with the continuous revolutionary ideological liberation, these sharp ideological weapons, we more deeply recognize the great power of the masses and further find the way to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, thereby promoting socialist construction to develop faster. Many facts in the current Great Leap Forward prove that as long as we seize the correct direction and give full play to the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, many things that were considered impossible in the past are now realized; many things that we did not think of, the masses also thought of and did. "Let the high mountains bow their heads and the rivers give way," this language that reflects the great character of the working people has become a large number of facts in real life. This communist style shows the liberated social productive forces and the great power of the awakened people. However, people cannot understand this epoch-making change quickly. Many people are bound by various kinds of thoughts under the old relations of production, and their minds are not completely liberated. They look at new problems with old eyes and treat the liberated people with the old views of small producers. Therefore, their thinking lags behind reality and their leadership lags behind the masses. In this way, it is inevitable to commit right-leaning conservative errors. In the socialist revolution and construction in recent years, right-leaning conservative thinking has always been the main obstacle to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses. As Chairman Mao pointed out in the preface to "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside": "But the current problem is that right-leaning conservative thinking is still at work in many aspects, making the work in many aspects unable to adapt to the development of objective circumstances. The current problem is that there are many things that could have been done with effort, but many people think that they cannot be done. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to continuously criticize those really existing right-leaning conservative thoughts." In our future work, we must earnestly and humbly study Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-Leninism, adhere to the principle of "politics in command, using the virtual to lead the real," continuously improve our ideological level, continuously criticize various right-leaning conservative thoughts, especially to seize the development of the communist ideological liberation movement, cultivate the communist style of the broad masses, so that everyone has ideals, everyone has ambition, everyone dares to create, and everyone strives to be advanced, giving full play to the creativity of the 600 million people, and constantly concentrating the wisdom of the masses, constantly carrying it forward, so that it will form an endless and irresistible force, making our production and construction speed increase rapidly, build socialism faster, and move towards communism. At the same time, only in this mass communist ideological liberation movement can we continuously improve our leadership level, combine revolutionary boldness with a spirit of seeking truth from facts, combine redness and expertise, closely rely on the masses, overcome all the difficulties on the road forward, promote the upsurge of socialist construction, and make our ideals come true as soon as possible.

　　人人有理想　人人敢创造
　　中共浙江省委第一书记　江华
    浙江和全国一样，已经兴起社会主义建设全面大跃进的新高潮。高潮从农业生产开始，推动了各项工作的全面跃进，到最近一个多月，形成了万马奔腾的破竹之势。在兴修水利方面：经过去冬今春的苦战，完成了各种水利工程七十多万处。完成的土石方数等于解放八年来总和的184％。全省二千五百多万亩水田的抗旱能力，已经达到七十天以上不下雨而不发生旱灾的有九百一十三万亩，五十天到七十天不下雨而不发生旱灾的有八百三十四万亩。两者合计占全省水田面积的68％，保证了种植双季稻的需要。在积肥方面：到四月底为止，共积了二百五十五亿担土杂肥料，平均每亩耕地达到七万五千斤。此外，绿肥总产量达到五百亿斤左右，平均每亩产量四千多斤。在改良土壤方面：全省原有低产田八百二十五万亩。已经改良了七百零九万亩。过去四年共改良了二百万亩，去冬今春不到半年就改良了五百零九万亩。在农具改革方面：创造和改良了四百多种农具，推广了一百三十三万件，出现了很多花钱少、效率高、操作方便的新式农具。在工业建设方面：依靠全党全民办工业，在一个多月的时间内，根据初步统计，全省就办了四千一百七十七个中小型工厂。比八年来新建工厂总数还多三倍。在文教战线上：一个月的时间就办了八千零七十二所农业中学，学生三十三万五千人；办了二万二千六百九十四所技术夜校，学生一百五十三万二千九百人。人们在社会主义建设中，大胆创造，力争上游。农村城市互相推动，互相支援。工农兵学商，机关干部，城镇居民，男女老少，一齐出动。整个4月份农村出勤率一直保持在农业总人口的60％以上。形成了空前规模的社会主义建设热潮。
    社会主义建设速度争论的本质
    广大群众的这股干劲，是以正确处理人民内部矛盾为主题的整风运动的结果。浙江的整风运动，先以反右派斗争为重点；后以“双反双比”为重点。反右派斗争解决了社会主义方向问题，鼓舞了广大群众的革命干劲；“双反双比”运动正在解决对社会主义建设路线的认识问题和工作方法问题，改善人与人之间特别是领导与群众之间的关系问题，这就促进群众的革命干劲不断地高涨。
    在整风和反右派斗争中，取得了思想战线和政治战线上社会主义革命的伟大胜利。同时，比较彻底地整顿了一次党的组织和干部队伍，揭露出一批右派分子，特别是揭露出像沙文汉、杨思一、彭瑞林、孙章禄等隐藏在省委内部的右派分子。这些人是阶级异己分子和叛徒，是极端个人主义者。他们与党外右派分子互相呼应，进行地方主义、修正主义和其他反党反社会主义的活动。他们为了实现篡夺党的领导的野心，在党内制造混乱。到处找岔子，拿大棒敲人。使党内的一部分人产生一种“多做多犯错误，少做少犯错误，不做不犯错误”的错觉，使浙江党组织在贯彻党的各项方针、任务上遇到了很大的困难。这些党内右派分子的被揭发、批判和清除，就以活生生的教材教育了广大干部和群众，帮助人们分清大是大非，明确了政治方向。从而巩固了党的领导，使全省党组织更加团结一致、集中力量去领导社会主义建设运动。
    “双反双比”运动的开展，和学习毛主席关于改进工作方法的指示，把整风运动推向更高的阶段。
    在浙江党组织内，几年来对于社会主义建设的速度问题是一直有争论的。在农业生产方面，许多同志认为只要努力争取，是可以大跃进的。但是有些人却经常批评省委“好大喜功、急躁冒进”，抓住几年来浙江粮食增产的平均数，坚持每年只能增长百分之二到百分之三。在工业生产方面，许多同志主张积极发展工业，但是有些人把办工业看得很神秘，强调消极的“平衡”和“控制”，不敢放手办工业。今年我们抓住了这些思想斗争中的对立面，采取摆事实、比高低、找原因的办法，发动大家进行辩论。在辩论粮食生产能否跃进中，事实表明：全省在一九五七年，已经有四个县比一九五六年增长百分之六十以上，有三百一十万亩达到了八百斤以上（占粮食种植面积三千万亩的百分之十以上）；这就说明粮食生产是可以大跃进的。事实还表明：黄岩县和平阳县，临安县和衢县，自然条件大致相同，而黄岩平均亩产量超过平阳二百多斤，临安的亩产量也超过衢县二百多斤。为什么会有这样大的差别？显然是两种领导思想、两种工作方法的结果。这样，就提出了问题：是按照过去的平均数来确定增产指标，不大费力气就实现计划，还是按照先进水平来确定增产指标，经过紧张的工作来实现跃进计划。同时也向后进的单位提出了这样的问题：“在相近的条件下，人家能办到，你为什么办不到？”因此，关于社会主义建设速度问题争论的实质，归根结蒂是对于社会主义建设事业，是鼓起干劲、力争上游，还是安于现状，消极畏难；对于历次运动是抓方向、抓本质、抓主流，还是攻其一点或几点而不及其余；对于新生事物和先进经验，是热情爱护、积极扶持，还是熟视无睹、求全责备。而最根本的问题就是依靠群众、依靠先进，充分发挥群众的智慧和力量，还是只见物不见人，迷信自己，迷信经验，迷信教条，不相信群众。党员和干部在这些问题上划清思想界限以后，就进一步提高了觉悟，鼓起了干劲。比先进学先进赶先进的工作方法
    要把广大群众发动起来，投入大跃进的行动，还必须坚决执行党的群众路线工作方法。在大跃进中，人们的精神状态，有鼓起干劲、力争上游的；有安于中游、稍有成绩就自满的；有空喊跃进、光说不做的；还有消极畏难、怀疑能否办到，甚至公然反对的。因此，跃进的指标订出来了，但是在运动初期各种具体措施跟不上。全省的积肥运动，在3月下旬以前的四个月中，只积了三十六亿担土杂肥，平均每亩只有一万一千斤。当时海盐县官堂乡平均每亩已经积足十二万斤以上，海盐县委要求全县做到“积足千担肥、实现千斤粮”。我们就抓住了这个先进典型，向全省各县发起竞赛，形势就大为改观。在短短的一个月中，全省积肥总数就从三十六亿担跃进到二百五十五亿担。在播种插秧季节，省委又抓住绍兴、缙云两县提出的以推广先进栽培技术、改良工具、开展技术训练为中心内容的技术革新运动，向全省各县发起竞赛。在十天内就形成了一个人人学技术、人人学文化的群众运动。在竞赛开展前后，省、地、县又连续组织了几次大规模的参观学习和检查评比。4月份又进行了全省规模的领导与群众结合的农业生产大检查。群众采取了大争大辩、大字报、现场会议、实地学习、促进表、跃进旗、墙头诗、光荣榜、献计簿等等方法，表扬了先进，帮助了后进，交流了经验，开展了批评和自我批评。合作社和合作社比，乡和乡比，县和县比，专区也和专区比。有的单位专门组织力量，收集其他单位的先进经验；有的单位把其他单位的指标、措施等有关资料贴在墙上，千方百计地去赶上先进。在这种争先恐后、大赶先进的声势中，有力地促进了生产的跃进，同时也促进了人们思想的变化。原来的先进单位兢兢业业、努力保持先进的荣誉；原来落后的单位急起直追，力争扭转局面；原来安于中游的也在“前后夹攻”中紧张起来了。这样，就形成了“比先进、学先进、赶先进”的热潮。群众说：“不信就看，不通就辩，不懂就学，学会就干”，干部也更加明确了“依靠先进、依靠群众”的思想和工作方法。
　　思想解放，生产跃进，互为因果
    运动发展的情况说明：人们思想的解放，促进了生产的跃进；生产的跃进又进一步推动了人们思想的前进。省委原来计划在五年到七年的时间实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案），实现粮食平均亩产量八百斤，棉花平均亩产量一百斤，油菜籽平均亩产量二百斤，生猪达到三千五百万头。同时，在灌溉、耕耘、运输、农产品加工等几个主要方面，基本上实现机械化和半机械化，作到乡乡有电站，建成大、中、小型相结合的为农业服务的地方工业网，普及小学和中学教育，扫除文盲，开展科学技术研究工作。但是，广大群众和干部为大跃进的形势所鼓舞，胆量更大了，提出要苦战三年，实现全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的主要指标，基本上改变浙江的面貌。他们向往的是“粮食满谷仓，工厂遍城乡，个个有文化，人人千斤粮”的美好前景。他们不愿再作大自然的奴隶，而要上山下海，向地球进军，向科学文化进军，作大自然的主人。毛主席的指示，人民冲天的干劲和实践的经验，都这样启示我们：要争取社会主义建设更大的跃进，就必须具有敢于理想、敢作敢为的共产主义的风格。就要抓住正确方向，不断地提出革命任务。使人们不是留恋既往，而是迷信将来；不是左顾右盼，欲行又止，束手束脚，小脚走路，而是大胆设想，大胆试验，百折不挠，勇往直前。
    毛主席关于不断革命、打破迷信、思想解放和社会主义建设路线的指示，对于我国共产主义事业的发展，具有极为深远的不可估量的意义。这些指示就像放出了一颗敲开智慧之门的氢弹，大大地鼓舞了人们敢于理想、敢于创造的勇气。我们在过去，依靠广大群众的革命创造性，取得了革命工作和建设工作的许多胜利；今天有了不断革命思想解放，这些锋利的思想武器，我们就更深刻地认识到群众的巨大力量，进一步找到发挥群众的积极性和创造性的道路，从而推动社会主义建设以更快的速度向前发展。在目前大跃进中许多事实证明：只要抓住正确方向，充分发挥群众的革命积极性，许多过去认为办不到的事情，现在都实现了；许多我们没有想到的事情，群众也想到办到了。“让高山低头、河水让路”，这句反映劳动人民的伟大性格的语言，在现实生活中已经成为大量的事实。这种共产主义的风格，显示出解放了的社会生产力、觉醒了的人民的巨大的力量。但是人们对于这种划时代的变化，并不是很快都能理解的，不少人受到旧的生产关系下各式各样的思想束缚，精神上没有完全解放出来，用老眼光来看新问题，用小生产者的旧观点来看待解放了的人民，因而思想落后于实际，领导落后于群众。这样，就必然要犯右倾保守的错误。几年来在社会主义革命和建设中，右倾保守思想一直是妨害群众积极性和创造性的主要障碍。正如毛主席在“中国农村的社会主义高潮”序言中所指出的：“但是现在的问题，还是右倾保守思想在许多方面作怪，使许多方面的工作不能适应客观情况的发展。现在的问题是经过努力本来可以做到的事情，却有很多人认为做不到。因此，不断地批判那些确实存在的右倾保守思想，就有完全的必要了。”我们在今后工作中，必须认真地虚心地学习毛泽东思想和马克思列宁主义，坚持“政治挂帅、以虚带实”的原则，不断地提高自己的思想水平，不断地批判各种右倾保守思想，特别是要抓紧开展共产主义思想解放运动，培养广大群众的共产主义风格，使人人有理想、人人有志气、人人敢于创造、人人力争先进，把六亿人民的创造性都充分发扬起来，并且不断地集中群众的智慧，不断地加以发扬光大，这样，就会形成一种无穷无尽的不可抗拒的力量，使我国的生产建设速度飞快地增涨，更快地建成社会主义、向共产主义迈进。同时，也只有在这种群众性的共产主义思想解放运动中，才能不断地提高我们的领导水平，把革命胆略和求实精神结合起来，把红与专结合起来，紧紧地依靠群众，克服前进道路上的一切困难，推动社会主义建设的高潮，一浪接一浪地不断高涨，使我们的理想尽快地实现。
