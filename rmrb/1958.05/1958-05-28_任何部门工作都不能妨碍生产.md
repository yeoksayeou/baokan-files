Any Department's Work Must Not Hinder Production
By People's Daily Commentator

What is the most important thing in the countryside right now? Anyone with a little agricultural common sense, anyone who simply looks out the window, can answer immediately: it’s the summer harvest and summer planting. Summer harvest and summer planting – what a busy and intense season it is! Wheat and other summer-ripening crops are urgently waiting to be harvested and threshed; early autumn crops need to be thinned and weeded urgently. If diseases and insect pests occur, they must be eliminated and treated. Late autumn crops must also be sown at this time. The shortage of rural labor often occurs during this season. People are working day and night to rush production, and still often miss deadlines. This year's summer harvest and summer planting are even more different than in previous years. From winter to spring, from spring to summer, people have achieved particularly fruitful results through hard work. How to ensure that these results are obtained, how to ensure that the urgent desire for a great leap forward in production throughout the year becomes a reality – doing a good job in the summer harvest and summer planting is a key. However, just as farmers are trying every means to do a good job in the summer harvest and summer planting, we have heard a small, discordant interlude.

The incident occurred in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province. The barley and wheat in Qingyang Township suffered from a serious case of scab, and the task of rescuing and treating the disease was very urgent. However, the industrial department insisted that the township set aside two days of production time to hold a meeting of the commune directors to discuss the issue of "commune-run factories." At the same time, in Xiagang, Changjing, Wenlin and other townships, the slogan "Stop production for three days and concentrate on eliminating illiteracy" was openly put forward. The county's industrial, financial, and trade departments constantly concentrated grassroots cadres in the county for meetings, with an average of five cadres from each township attending meetings in the county. These situations show that the work of the departments in Jiangyin County is not in line with the current central task – the summer harvest and summer planting – and as a result, hinders production. It is a good thing that the work of all departments strives for a great leap forward. The enthusiasm of the comrades in these departments is also commendable. But why occupy precious production time?

The contradiction between departmental work and central work is an old problem. At a time when all work is striving for a great leap forward, it is necessary to re-emphasize this old problem. Comrade Mao Zedong once used playing the piano to talk about this issue in a popular and vivid way. He said that playing the piano has a main melody and harmony. If the harmony overwhelms the main melody, the whole piece will inevitably lose its color. This is a bad way to play. If departmental work squeezes out the summer harvest and summer planting and hinders it, this year's great leap forward in production will not achieve the expected results. Wouldn't much of the hard work that farmers have done continuously throughout the winter and spring, building so many water conservancy projects and accumulating so much fertilizer, be wasted? Summer harvest and summer planting are a crucial link in this year's great leap forward in production. Production is the foundation of all work. The thought that any department's work must be based on production, for the sake of production, and subordinate to production. Separating from production and hindering production will turn a good thing into a bad thing.

Why are the various business departments able to directly order grassroots organizations and the masses to put aside production and do other things according to their own needs during the busy production season? Is the power of the departments too great? Why doesn't the county party committee unify and arrange the work of various departments around production? Where has the role of the Party's unified leadership gone? Where has the commanding role of politics gone? We hope that the leading comrades of Jiangyin County will immediately consider these issues and take measures.

    任何部门工作都不能妨碍生产
    本报评论员
    当前农村中最重要的事情是什么？只要稍为有点农业常识，只要抬起眼睛往玻璃窗外看看，都可以马上回答，是夏收夏种。夏收夏种，这是一个多么繁忙紧张的季节呵！小麦和其他夏熟作物急等着收割，打场；早秋作物要赶着间苗，锄草。病虫害发生了，还要除虫治病。晚秋作物也要在这时候赶着下种。农村劳力不足，经常就发生在这个季节。人们夜以继日地突击生产，还时常要误事。今年的夏收夏种，更比往年不同。从冬到春，从春到夏，人们经过勤劳苦干，取得了特别丰硕的成果，怎样保证这些成果拿得到手，怎样保证全年生产大跃进的迫切愿望变成现实，搞好夏收夏种是重要的关键。可是，当农民正在千方百计争取搞好夏收夏种的时候，我们却听到了一支小小的不和谐的插曲。
    事情发生在江苏省江阴县。青暘乡的大麦和元麦发生了严重的赤霉病，抢治病害的任务很紧急。可是，工业部门却硬要这个乡拿出两天的生产时间来开社主任会议，讨论“社办工厂”问题。与此同时，在夏港、长泾、文林等乡公开提出“停止生产三天，集中扫盲”的口号。县的工业、财贸等部门，都不断地把基层干部集中到县里开会，平均每个乡经常有五个干部到县里开会。这些情况，说明江阴县的部门工作与当前的中心工作——夏收夏种很不合拍，结果妨碍了生产。各个部门的工作都要大跃进，这是好事。这些部门工作同志的积极性也值得嘉许。可是，为什么去占用一刻千金的生产时间呢？
    部门工作与中心工作的矛盾，这是老问题了。在各项工作都争取大跃进的时候，这个老问题有重新提起注意的必要。毛泽东同志曾经用弹钢琴来通俗而生动地谈过这个问题。他说，弹钢琴有主调，有和音。和音压倒了主调，全曲必然为之失色。这是坏的弹法。部门工作把夏收夏种挤掉了，妨碍了，今年的生产大跃进就会得不到预期的成果。农民整个冬天和整个春天连续不停地苦干，修了那么多水利，积了那么多肥料，岂不有好多要白费？夏收夏种，是今年生产大跃进的紧要关节。生产，是一切工作的基础。任何部门工作，都要以生产为主、为了生产和服从生产的思想。离开了生产，妨碍了生产，好事就会变成坏事。
    为什么各个业务部门在生产紧张的季节都能够按照自己一方的要求直接命令基层组织和群众放下生产来搞别的事情呢？部门的权力是不是太大了？县委为什么不围绕着生产来统一安排各部门的工作？党的统一领导的作用哪里去了？政治的统帅作用哪里去了？我们希望江阴县的领导同志们马上考虑这些问题，并采取措施。
