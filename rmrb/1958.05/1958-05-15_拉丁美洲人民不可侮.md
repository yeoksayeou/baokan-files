The People of Latin America Cannot Be Humiliated

On May 13th, U.S. Vice President Nixon arrived in Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, with the deep hatred of the people of several Latin American countries he had just visited. This was the last stop on his Latin American tour and also the place where he encountered the most intense opposition and condemnation. According to foreign news agencies, thousands of angry Venezuelans, waving anti-American banners and shouting anti-American slogans, staged a powerful demonstration against Nixon and his entourage.

The strong opposition Nixon encountered from the people of Latin American countries is the inevitable result of the United States' cruel colonial and plundering policy towards Latin America. U.S. monopoly capital has always regarded Latin America as its "backyard," plundering and enslaving it at will, placing Latin American countries in a position of dependence on the United States economically and politically. Especially after the outbreak of the U.S. economic crisis, the U.S. government tried to alleviate its own economic difficulties by lowering import raw material prices, restricting import quotas, raising tariffs, and dumping "surplus" agricultural products, thereby pushing the Latin American countries' economies to the brink of collapse. In the case of Peru, the decline in the prices of lead, zinc, cotton, and coffee, as well as U.S. import restrictions and the sale of American cotton on the world market at dumping prices, made it impossible for Peruvian goods to find a market, resulting in a serious deterioration of the economic situation. In the past year, the country's dollar reserves have fallen from 40 million U.S. dollars to 4 million U.S. dollars. Venezuela, which produces oil, has been severely affected by the U.S. decision to reduce oil import quotas by 15%, with the fiscal situation deteriorating. In March alone, the country's foreign trade deficit reached 70 million U.S. dollars. Moreover, the U.S. government also carries out political interference and military control over these countries. The dictator Jiménez, who was overthrown by the Venezuelan people, has always been protected by the U.S. government. This situation cannot but arouse great anger among the people of Latin American countries.

The American imperialists, who have been so strongly opposed by the people of Latin America, are attempting to further strengthen their interference and control over Latin American countries. After the anti-Nixon demonstration in Venezuela, U.S. President Eisenhower ordered Dulles to summon the Venezuelan Chargé d'Affaires for "questioning." The U.S. Department of Defense even dispatched four companies of Marines and paratroopers to Caribbean bases, preparing to use the pretext of "protecting" Nixon to intimidate the Venezuelan people and carry out armed intervention. This fully exposes the ferocious face of American imperialism and proves that the real purpose of Nixon's "goodwill visit" is merely to salvage America's declining political influence in Latin America and further strengthen its control over the people of Latin America.

However, the people of Latin America, who have been bullied and exploited by U.S. monopoly capital, have awakened. Nixon's experience shows that the people of Latin America cannot be humiliated and that American colonialism is bankrupt. The U.S. policy of control and enslavement of Latin America is coming to an end.

    拉丁美洲人民不可侮
    5月13日，美国副总统尼克松带着他刚刚访问过的几个拉丁美洲国家人民的深刻仇恨到了委内瑞拉的首都加拉加斯。这是他这次拉丁美洲之行的最后一站，也是他遭到反对、唾骂最激烈的一个地方。据外国通讯社报道，数千愤怒的委内瑞拉人民挥舞着反美标语，高呼着反美口号，向尼克松一行进行了强大的示威。
    尼克松遭到拉丁美洲各国人民的强烈反对，是美国对拉丁美洲残酷的殖民掠夺政策的必然结果。美国垄断资本一向把拉丁美洲当作他们的“后院”，为所欲为地进行掠夺和奴役，使拉丁美洲国家经济和政治处于依附美国的地位。特别是在美国经济危机爆发后，美国政府力图用压低进口原料价格、限制进口数额、提高关税和倾销“剩余”农产品的办法来减轻自己的经济困难，从而使拉丁美洲国家经济几乎陷入绝境。以秘鲁的情况而言，由于铅、锌、棉花、咖啡的价格下跌，美国限制进口和用倾销价格在世界市场上出售美国棉花，使秘鲁的货物找不到市场，经济情况严重恶化。最近一年来，这个国家的美元贮备从四千万美元降到四百万美元。出产石油的委内瑞拉，由于美国决定把石油进口限额减少15％，经济受到极大打击，财政状况日益恶化，仅今年3月一个月中，国家的对外贸易逆差就达七千万美元。不仅如此，美国政府还对这些国家进行政治干涉和军事控制。被委内瑞拉人民推翻的独裁者希门尼斯就一直受到美国政府的庇护。这种情况不能不激起拉丁美洲国家人民的极大愤怒。
    受到拉丁美洲人民如此强烈反对的美国帝国主义，企图进一步加强对拉丁美洲国家的干涉和控制。在委内瑞拉发生反对尼克松的示威之后，美国总统艾森豪威尔竟命令杜勒斯召见委内瑞拉代办“查问”；美国国防部更派遣四连海军陆战队和伞兵前往加勒比基地，准备借口“保护”尼克松来吓唬委内瑞拉人民，并实行武装干涉。这充分暴露了美国的帝国主义狰狞面目，并证明尼克松的“亲善访问”的真正目的，不过是想挽回美国在拉丁美洲日益衰落的政治势力和进一步加强对拉丁美洲人民的控制罢了。
    但是，备受美国垄断资本欺凌、压榨的拉丁美洲人民已经觉醒了。尼克松的遭遇正表明拉丁美洲的人民不可侮和美国殖民主义的破产。美国对拉丁美洲的控制和奴役政策是已经到了结束的时候了。
