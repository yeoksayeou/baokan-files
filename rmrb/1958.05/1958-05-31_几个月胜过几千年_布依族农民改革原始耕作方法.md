Months Surpass Millennia
Bouyei Farmers Reform Primitive Farming Methods

Wangmo County, located in the mountainous area bordering southern Guizhou and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is a place where the Bouyei people live in compact communities. For thousands of years, primitive farming methods such as "slash-and-burn" and "shifting cultivation" have been prevalent. However, this spring, under the leadership of the Party, more than 80,000 Bouyei farmers in the county are completely breaking away from the backward production status left over from the old society and embarking on a comprehensive leap forward on the road of agricultural technology revolution.

Many Bouyei farmers in Wangmo County are accustomed to burning patches of mountain forest, using the ashes as fertilizer, sowing seeds in the spring, and then neither fertilizing nor weeding, simply waiting for the autumn harvest. After two or three years, when the fertility of the land is exhausted, they abandon it and move to another hillside to continue slash-and-burn cultivation. As a result, the yield is very low, and "sowing a slope, harvesting a pot" has become commonplace.

After thorough research, the Wangmo County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that the key to achieving the agricultural development program's grain targets ahead of schedule lies in the comprehensive reform of farming techniques. Since December of last year, agricultural technology reform committees have been established at the county, district, township, and commune levels. Each district has established a part-work, part-study agricultural middle school; and each commune has established a political, cultural, and production technology (three-in-one) night school, and short-term training courses have been set up to train farmer technicians. At the same time, the county has organized cadres at all levels and the masses to debate the improvement of farming methods through various on-site meetings and visits for comparison, criticized right-leaning conservative ideas that hinder technological reform, and formulated ten major measures for the agricultural leap forward this year. Plans have also been made for the county's land, with 70,000 mu of sloping land unsuitable for cultivation being returned to forest; and 80,000 mu of shifting cultivated land being transformed into fixed cultivated land, in order to achieve intensive cultivation.

In just a few months, the changes in farming techniques in Wangmo County have surpassed the past millennia. Now, "slash-and-burn" has disappeared throughout the county; some Bouyei farmers who have relied on mountain living and shifting cultivation for generations have begun to have fixed cultivated land and are cultivating these lands intensively. New-style agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-shared plows have replaced primitive plows made of stones and branches. Techniques such as "triangular cluster planting" and soaking seeds in baking soda, which the older generation of farmers had never heard of, have been widely promoted throughout the county this spring.

### 几个月胜过几千年  布依族农民改革原始耕作方法

    几个月胜过几千年
    布依族农民改革原始耕作方法
    在贵州南部和广西僮族自治区毗邻的望谟县，是布依族聚居的山区。那里，千百年来盛行着“刀耕火种”、“轮歇游垦”原始的耕作方法。但在今年春天，全县八万多布依族农民在党的领导下，正彻底摆脱旧社会遗留下来的落后生产状态，开始在农业技术革命的道路上全面跃进。
    望谟县布依族不少农民习惯把一片片山林烧去，利用这一点点草木灰作肥料，春天撒上种子，以后既不施肥又不除草，只是坐等秋收。过两三年，土地肥力竭尽，就把它抛弃，游垦到另一个山坡，继续刀耕火种。因而产量很低，“种一坡，收一锅”已成常事。
    中共望谟县委经过充分研究，认为争取提前实现农业发展纲要粮食指标，关键在于全面改革耕作技术。从去年12月以来，县、区、乡、社都先后成立农业技术改革委员会；每区建立一所半耕半读的农业中学；社社办起政治、文化、生产技术（三合一）的夜校，并开办短期训练班，培养农民技术员。与此同时，全县通过各种现场会议和参观评比，组织各级干部和群众对改进耕作方法展开了辩论，批判了阻碍技术改革的右倾保守思想，订出了今年农业大跃进的十大措施。对于全县土地也作出规划，把七万亩不宜耕作的坡土退耕还林；八万亩轮歇土变为固定耕地，作到精耕细作。
    几个月来，望谟县耕作技术的改变，胜过以往几千年。现在“刀耕火种”已在全县范围内绝迹；部分世世代代靠赶山吃饭、游垦为生的布依族农民，开始有了固定的耕地，并且在这些土地上精耕细作。双轮双铧犁等新式农具已经代替了用石头、树枝制成的原始犁。老一辈农民从来没有听过的“三角丛植”、小苏打浸种等技术，今春已普遍在全县推广。
