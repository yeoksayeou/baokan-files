　　The pagoda tree blooms, fragrance fills the city,
　　A meeting is held under the pagoda tree, the electric lights shine bright.
　　Women from families in the courtyard gather,
　　In an instant, mothers and children hum and cry.
　　Some are whispering sweet nothings,
　　Some children cry and their mothers feel the pain.
　　Director Zhang opens his mouth to address the sisters,
　　There is an urgent task to complete:
　　All for the sake of the reservoir project,
　　The agricultural cooperative's male labor force has all gone to the Thirteen Tombs;
　　As the saying goes, "Hoe the fields all over within three days of the Beginning of Summer,"
　　If the seedlings are neglected, it will be difficult to harvest.
　　Sisters, who doesn't have a child pulling at their leg,
　　Please support agriculture and sign up.
　　Director Zhang's mobilization report has just ended,
　　In the meeting place, "I'll go! I'll go!" is shouted repeatedly.
　　Watching the enthusiasm of the people signing up,
　　Excited the young wife Sun Junying.
　　This wife is no more than twenty-five years old,
　　Tall and slender with big eyes;
　　Wearing a floral cloth jacket and carrying a small baby,
　　Her voice is like a silver bell.
　　She said: "I object to the director's method,
　　Why look down on women with children?
　　Back then, Mu Guiying was pregnant and took command,
　　She made great achievements by breaking Hongzhou in confinement.
　　My Xiaobao is already five months old,
　　He was born in December last winter.
　　His father is a welder in a steel factory,
　　Our family was originally brothers with the farmers.
　　If you don't let me go to support the agricultural cooperative,
　　I will be restless at home, unable to stand still.
　　I guarantee that when the child is asleep, I will put him on the ground,
　　When he wakes up, I will carry the baby and do the work."

　　(White) This woman is probably from Jiaodong,
　　Working is not called working, but is called doing business.
　　If the sisters with children form a team,
　　Is it okay to form a mutual aid organization?"
　　Suddenly, a large group of women signed up,
　　Each carrying a child of one or two years old.
　　Director Zhang thought to himself upon seeing this situation,
　　He said, "I still need to rectify my thinking.
　　It's all because my conservative thoughts haven't been swept away,
　　That I looked down on women with children."
　　Seventy-two young women were formed into a team,
　　And thirty-six mothers and children formed a team.
　　The streets were filled with drums and gongs, celebrating,
　　The agricultural cooperative also sent a large cart to welcome them.
　　This is the mother-child team supporting agriculture,
　　Another new thing has appeared in Beijing.

    母子队（鼓词）
  　陶钝槐树上开花香满城，槐树下开会电灯明。大院里家庭妇女来聚会，刹时间妈妈孩子乱嘤嘤。有的是交头接耳家常话，有的是孩子哭了娘心疼。张主任开口先称众姊妹，有一件紧急任务要完成：都只为水库工程赶的紧，农业社男劳力都去十三陵；常言说“立夏三日锄头遍”，倘若是荒了苗子难收成。姊妹们谁没有孩子扯住腿，就请您支援农业来报名。张主任动员报告刚住口，会场里“我去！我去”叫连声。眼看着人家报名这股劲，激动了青年媳妇孙俊英。这媳妇年纪不过二十五，细高条身量大眼睛；花布袄揣着个小娃子，讲话的声音赛银铃。她言道：“主任的办法我反对，为什么把有孩子的妇女看得轻。想当年穆桂英身怀有孕挂了帅，月子里大破洪州立大功。俺小宝这时已够五个月，他本是腊月里生人去年冬。他爸爸钢铁厂里当焊匠，俺一家原和农民是弟兄。不叫我前去支援农业社，我在家坐不安来立不宁。我保证，孩子睡了放在地头上，他醒了我驮着宝宝干营生。
    （白）这位妇女大概是胶东户，干活不叫干活，叫做干营生。倘若是有孩子的姊妹成了队，搞一个互助组织行不行？”忽啦啦报名的妇女一大片，都有个一两岁的孩子抱怀中。张主任见此情形心里想，他言道：“我还需要再整风。都是我保守思想没扫净，才把那有孩子的妇女看得轻。”编成了姑娘队员七十二，还有那母子队三十六名。街道上敲锣打鼓齐欢送，农业社也派大车来欢迎。这就是母子队支援农业，北京市又出现一件新事情。
