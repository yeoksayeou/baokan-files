    The East Wind Blows Open a Garden Full of Flowers
    Zhejiang Province Has Basically Universalized Primary Education
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter You Qi reports: Zhejiang Province has achieved great success in universalizing primary education and has created many experiences. To this end, the reporter recently interviewed Liu Yifu, Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education.
    Comrade Liu Yifu introduced: Zhejiang Province has eighty-one counties and cities. Since the great leap forward in cultural and educational work in early April this year, fifty-six counties and cities have universalized primary education, with the number of children enrolled accounting for 90%-95% of the school-age children. Although the other twenty-five counties and cities have not yet universalized, the number of children enrolled has reached about 80%. It is estimated that they can meet the requirements for universalization in another month or two.
    Comrade Liu Yifu continued: The reason why the work of universalizing primary education can be carried out with good quality, large quantity, and speed is not from "technology in command" or "business in command," but from the result of "politics in command." It is the result of the personal leadership of party committees and party organizations at all levels, and the implementation of the Party Central Committee's policy on mass education and the work method of the mass line. Precisely because it is "politics in command," coupled with the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, going all out, aiming high, this east wind has blown open the vast masses' urgent demand for cultural knowledge, a garden full of beautiful flowers waiting to bloom. Only then can it be possible to universalize primary education in about 70% of the counties and cities in Zhejiang Province in less than two months, while at the same time running more than 8,000 agricultural middle schools and more than 22,600 agricultural technical night schools. The newly added private primary schools number more than 10,000, and the newly enrolled children, including those in public primary schools, number nearly one million.
    Then, he summarized several main experiences in popularizing primary education in Zhejiang. He said: The first fundamental issue in popularizing primary education is the ideological education and improvement of the understanding of the masses. This time, during the rural rectification and the Great Leap Forward, many places also debated the issue of popularizing primary education. In the debate, it played a significant role in breaking the deeply rooted "valuing men over women" ideology among the masses. In Zhejiang, the issue of popularizing primary education is actually mainly about enrolling girls. Before April this year, more than 80% of school-age boys in the province were enrolled, while the proportion of girls enrolled was only close to 30%. After the broad masses criticized the "valuing men over women" ideology, they immediately made every effort to organize a large number of childcare groups, green cutting teams, communal dining groups, and pig and sheep feeding groups, mainly composed of elderly people, to liberate girls from housework such as taking care of younger siblings, boiling water, steaming rice, and cutting green grass to feed pigs.
    The second fundamental issue is that running schools must be closely integrated with production. Therefore, the teaching organization form must be diversified. After the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the labor force is particularly tight. If running schools is not combined with production, it will not be popularized, and even if it is popularized for a while, it will be difficult to consolidate. In order to meet the needs of production, private primary schools in various parts of Zhejiang have created many forms, including full-day classes, half-day classes, morning classes, evening classes, night classes, field classes, mobile classes, etc.; they have also broken the usual practice of the holiday system, not based on weeks, winter and summer vacations, but based on the busy and slack seasons of farming; classes are suspended during busy farming seasons to participate in labor, and more classes are taken during slightly slack farming seasons.
    The third fundamental issue is to solve the problem of teachers and improve the quality of teachers. In Zhejiang, primary school teachers were not a problem. In recent years, the state has trained tens of thousands of junior high school graduates to work in rural areas. They are young and promising and are the best teachers. But there are also some specific problems that must be solved. The problems that need to be solved mainly include economic treatment, political treatment, and business improvement. Many places have implemented the method of signing contracts, paying basic wages every month, and also calculating work points separately when participating in the labor of the cooperative; they are treated the same as formal members politically and enjoy the welfare benefits of the cooperative; and schools and teaching equipment should also be properly resolved as much as possible. In terms of business improvement, the province has adopted a policy of treating teachers of private primary schools and public primary schools equally. Cultural and educational cadre schools, normal teacher colleges and provincial teacher training colleges at all levels accept the rotation training of private primary school teachers; in particular, the normal correspondence departments run by various places are preparing to absorb a large number of private primary school teachers to participate in learning; teaching reference materials compiled and printed by education departments at all levels are also issued to private school teachers.
    Comrade Liu Yifu finally said: In this movement to popularize primary education, Zhejiang has also paid special attention to mountainous areas and islands. At present, the Tianmu Mountain area in western Zhejiang and the Siming Mountain area in eastern Zhejiang have popularized primary education. Even in the mountainous areas of southern Zhejiang, where transportation was most inconvenient and culture was very underdeveloped in the past, the number of children enrolled has reached about 80%. In particular, on the various islands scattered like stars in the East China Sea, as long as there are villages, primary schools have been set up. In this way, it can be truly said that spring flowers are in full bloom, spreading their beauty to the high mountains and oceans. The question for the future is that we must continue to go all out, strive to continuously solve new problems, and achieve the highest enrollment rate of school-age children in the province.
    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Tu Zhengfeng reports: Zhejiang Province has basically universalized primary education, achieving the goal of having complete primary schools in townships, junior primary schools in cooperatives, and junior primary schools or literacy classes in villages. In early April, Zhejiang Province convened an on-site meeting on the great leap forward in primary education in Chongde County. Since then, various places have mostly been led by secretaries, mobilized the whole party, and mobilized the whole people to take the great leap forward in education as an integral part of the province's great leap forward centered on agricultural production, unified planning, unified deployment, and inspection. Private primary schools have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain.
    In establishing private primary schools, various places have implemented the spirit of diligence and thrift in running schools, and the school buildings and equipment are simple. Most of the school buildings use old ancestral halls, temples, and borrowed private houses, or rely on the masses to help with labor, materials, and money to build simple school buildings. Desks and benches are mostly brought by students themselves, and other teaching equipment is gradually added by using waste materials. The recurring expenses are solved by the following aspects: charging students fees, subsidizing agricultural cooperatives' public welfare funds, members' voluntary labor, and the income from teachers' and students' labor production. The wages of teachers are mostly paid monthly by agricultural cooperatives in the form of fixed wages, and the standard is equivalent to the income of the local middle and upper labor force. In areas where economic conditions are poor, the scale of agricultural cooperatives is small, and there is not much public welfare fund, most of them adopt the method of cooperative office assistance. In mountainous areas where the population is scattered, agricultural cooperatives are small, and there are few students, teachers teach half a day and work half a day. In this way, the masses do not spend much money, the burden is light, and the teachers' lives are guaranteed. Many primary schools run by urban residents' committees are generally led by residents' committees and donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life who run schools. The source of teachers is mainly knowledgeable young people who study at home. Methods such as hiring by townships and cooperatives, approval by the government, or recommendation by the government and hiring by the masses are adopted. In mountainous areas such as Jinyun, Qingtian, and Huangyan, teachers in private primary schools are mostly cooperative accountants, who both teach and participate in production, which can save more expenses.

    东风吹开了满园花朵
    浙江省已基本普及小学教育
    本报讯　记者尤淇报道：浙江省在普及小学教育工作上已获得很大成绩，而且创造了不少经验，为此，最近记者访问了浙江省教育厅副厅长刘亦夫同志。
    刘亦夫同志介绍说：浙江省现有八十一个县市，从今年4月初文教工作大跃进以来到现在，已有五十六个县市普及了小学教育，入学儿童占适龄儿童数的90％—95％。其他二十五个县市虽然还没有普及，入学儿童也已达到80％左右，估计再过一、二个月就可以达到普及的要求。
    刘亦夫同志接着说：这次普及小学教育的工作所以能够质好、量多而又快速地开展起来，首先不是从“技术挂帅”“业务挂帅”而来，而是“政治挂帅”的结果，是各级党委、党组织亲自领导，和贯彻执行了党中央关于群众办学的方针以及群众路线的工作方法的结果。正因为是“政治挂帅”，再加上多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的建设总路线这股东风，就一下子吹开了广大群众迫切要求文化知识这一满园艳丽待放的花朵，才能不出两个月工夫，在浙江全省与开办八千多所农业中学和二万二千六百多所农业技术夜校的同时，又在70％左右的县市普及了小学教育，新增加的民办小学约有一万多所，新入学的儿童连公立小学扩收的在内有近百万名。
    接着，总结了浙江普及小学教育的几点主要经验。他说：普及小学教育的第一个根本性问题是群众的思想教育和认识的提高。这次刚好在农村整风和大跃进中，很多地方对普及小学教育问题也进行了辩论，在辩论中特别对破除群众中根深蒂固的“重男轻女”思想起了很大作用。在浙江普及小学教育的问题实际上主要是吸收女孩子入学的问题。在今年4月以前，全省已有80％以上的适龄男孩入学，而女孩子入学的比例不过才近30％。广大群众在批判了“重男轻女”思想以后，马上又千方百计地大量组织以老年人为主的托儿组、割青队、搭伙组、喂猪饲羊组等，把女孩子从看管弟妹、烧水蒸饭、割青喂猪等家务劳动中解放出来。
    第二个根本性问题是办学要与生产密切结合，因此在教学组织形式上必须多样化，农业在大跃进后，劳动力特别紧张，如果办学不结合生产，就一定不能普及，即使一时普及了也难于巩固。浙江各地民办小学为了适合生产的需要，创造了许多种形式，有全日班、半日班、早班、晚班、夜班、田头班、流动班等等；也打破了假日制度的常例，不以星期、寒暑假为标准，而以农事忙闲为依据；农忙时停课参加劳动，农事稍闲时多学几课。
    第三个根本性问题是解决师资和提高师资。在浙江，小学师资本来是不成问题的，几年来国家已培养有好几万初中毕业生在农村中劳动，他们年青有为，是最好的师资。但也有一些具体问题必须解决。需要解决的问题主要有经济待遇、政治待遇和业务提高三个方面。不少地方已推行了订合同的办法，每月支付给基本的工资，参加社的劳动时还另计工分；政治上和正式社员同样看待，并享受社的福利待遇；在校舍和教学设备上也要尽量予以适当解决。在业务提高方面，全省采取了对民办小学和公立小学教师一视同仁的政策，各地文教干部学校、普通师范和省的教师进修学院都同样接受民办小学教师轮训；特别是各地办的师范函授部，正准备大量吸收民办小学教师参加学习；各级教育部门编印的教学参考资料，也同样发给民校教师。
    刘亦夫同志最后说：浙江在这次普及小学教育运动中，还特别注意了山区和海岛，目前浙西天目山区、浙东四明山区都已经普及了小学教育，就是过去交通最不便当、文化很不发展的浙南山区，入学儿童也已达到80％上下。特别是星罗棋布似的散处在东海上的各个海岛，只要有村落的，也都办起了小学。这样，真可说得上春花盛开，艳及高山海洋了。今后的问题，是要我们继续鼓足干劲，为不断解决新的问题和达到全省适龄儿童最高的入学比例而努力。
    本报讯　记者屠正峰报道：浙江省已基本普及小学教育，做到了乡有完小，社有初小，村有初小或识字班。4月上旬，浙江省在崇德县召开了全省小学教育事业大跃进的现场会议后，各地多以书记挂帅、全党动员、全民动手，把教育事业大跃进作为以农业生产为中心的全省大跃进的组成部分，统一规划、统一布置和检查，民办小学如雨后春笋般发展起来。
    各地在建立民办小学中，都贯彻了勤俭办学的精神，校舍、设备因陋就简。校舍大部分利用旧有的祠堂、庙宇和借用民房，或依靠群众助工、助料、助钱建造简易校舍。课桌、板凳多由学生自带，其他教学设备利用废物改制、逐步添置。经常费用由下列几方面解决：向学生收费，由农业社公益金补贴，由社员作义务劳动，教师学生劳动生产的收入等。教师的工资，大多由农业社按照固定工资形式按月支付，标准相当于当地中上劳动力的收入，在经济条件较差、农业社规模较小、公益金不多的地区，大多数采取社办公助方式。在山区人口分散，农业社小，学生少的地区，采取教师半日教学、半日劳动。这样，群众出钱不多，负担轻，教师生活有保证。许多城镇群众自办的小学，一般由居民委员会领导，热心办学的社会人士捐助。师资来源，主要是在家自学的知识青年，采取乡社聘请、政府批准或政府推荐、群众聘请等办法。在缙云、青田、黄岩等山区，民办小学教师多是合作社会计，既教学又参加生产，更能节约开支。
