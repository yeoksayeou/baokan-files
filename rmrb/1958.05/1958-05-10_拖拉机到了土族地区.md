Tractors Arrive in the Tu Ethnic Region

By Our Correspondent Yang Liben

During this year's spring plowing and sowing season, in China's only Tu Autonomous Region—the Huzhu Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province—seven townships are using tractors to plow and sow 40,000 mu of land. The arrival of tractors in this region has been warmly welcomed by the Tu people. Elderly Tu people happily say, "The days of plowing with oxen are over!" Children have composed and are singing a ballad: "Plow deep, plow thoroughly, plow to eradicate the weeds; sow well, sow evenly, without overlapping or missing a single row."

The Huzhu Tu Autonomous County is located at the southern foot of the Qilian Mountains. Agricultural tools have always been backward, and even now, a few farmers still use the "two oxen tandem" method for plowing. Last autumn, the government established a tractor station here, equipped with ten tractors of various types and machinery for plowing, harrowing, rolling, and sowing. Before the spring plowing this year, the first group of tractor drivers and agricultural implement operators were trained for the Tu farmers. At the beginning of the spring plowing, Tu drivers, led by experienced Han drivers, drove tractors to the agricultural cooperatives. Each cooperative decorated the tractors with red banners and adorned the tractor drivers with flowers. Elderly Tu people visited the director of the tractor station to thank the Han brothers for training talent for the Tu people.

To meet the Tu farmers' desire to realize agricultural mechanization, the autonomous county's tractor station plans to expand and experiment with placing tractors in agricultural cooperatives for self-use and self-management by the cooperatives. As soon as this news was released, three cooperatives made reservations to buy tractors and other agricultural machinery. (Attached picture)

    拖拉机到了土族地区
    本报记者　杨立本
    在今年的春耕播种中，在我国唯一的土族自治地区——青海省互助土族自治县，有七个乡用拖拉机耕地和播种四万亩。拖拉机来到这个地区受到土族人民极大的欢迎。土族老人高兴地说：耕地不用牛的日子到了。儿童们编了歌谣来传唱：“犁得深，犁得透，犁得野草绝了后；播得好，播得匀，不重不漏一根绳”。
    互助土族自治县在祁连山南麓，农具一向落后，至今还有少数农民用“二牛抬杠”犁地。去年秋天，政府在这里建立了一个拖拉机站，配备了十台各型拖拉机和犁、耙、镇压、播种等机械。今年春耕前，还为土族农民培养了第一批拖拉机手和农具手。春耕开始时，土族驾驶员在汉族老驾驶员带领下，驾着拖拉机到达农业社，每个社都给拖拉机挂红，给拖拉机手戴花。土族老人纷纷拜访拖拉机站的站长，感谢汉族老大哥为土族培养了人材。
    为了适应土族农民实现农业机械化的愿望，自治县拖拉机站准备扩建，并试办拖拉机放到农业社，由社自用自管。这个消息刚刚传出，已有三个社预约买拖拉机和其他农业机具。（附图片）
