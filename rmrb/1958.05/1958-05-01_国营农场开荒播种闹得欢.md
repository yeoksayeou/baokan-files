State-owned Farms Enthusiastically Engage in Land Reclamation and Sowing

(Our report) Over 700 state-owned agricultural and pastoral farms across the country are working intensely on land reclamation and sowing.

As of late April, the land reclamation work of various farms, excluding Heilongjiang Province due to late thawing, had seen the reclamation of 2.02 million mu, according to statistics from eleven provinces (and autonomous regions) including Hubei, Xinjiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hebei, Fujian, and Gansu.

According to statistics from state-owned farms in the Mishan Reclamation Area, the Xinjiang Reclamation Area, and the four provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Xinjiang, and Hubei, the spring sowing area has exceeded 1 million mu. Farms in South China have exceeded their original sowing plans. Heilongjiang and Hebei provinces have completed over 60% of their spring sowing tasks, and farms in the suburbs of Beijing have finished their spring sowing.

This year, inspired by the central government's call to exert full effort, strive for advancement, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the workers on the farms are highly motivated. Many farms are applying two to three times more fertilizer than last year, generally averaging 2,000 to 3,000 jin per mu. In Hubei, some farms are applying over 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Water conservancy projects in various regions have generally been completed according to plan. The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has completed most of its thirty-one water conservancy projects before spring sowing. The completed water conservancy projects can improve and expand the irrigated area by 1.5 million mu.

Currently, sowing work is still underway in various regions. Although some areas experienced late thawing and spring drought, leaders and the masses have taken various measures to ensure the normal progress and quality of sowing.

    国营农场开荒播种闹得欢
    本报讯　分布在全国各地的七百多个国营农牧场，正在紧张地进行开荒播种。
    各农场的开荒工作截至4月下旬止，除黑龙江省因解冻迟未开始外，据湖北、新疆、广东、江西、安徽、浙江、湖南、湖北、河北、福建、甘肃十一个省（区）统计，已开荒二百零二万亩。
    据密山垦区、新疆垦区及江西、湖南、新疆、湖北四省的国营农场的统计，春播面积已完成一百余万亩。华南各个农场已超额完成原播种计划，黑龙江、河北两省均已完成春播任务60％以上，北京市郊各场春播已经结束。
    今年各场春耕工作在中央鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省的建设方针的鼓舞下，广大职工干劲很大。许多农场施肥量超过去年两、三倍，一般平均可达二至三千斤。湖北各场每亩施肥量达万斤以上。各地农场的水利工程大都能按计划完成。新疆兵团在三十一项水利工程中，大部在春播前完成。已完成的水利工程，可改善和扩大灌溉面积达一百五十万亩。
    目前，各地播种工作还正在进行，虽然有些地区解冻迟又遇春旱，但领导和群众采取了各种办法，仍然保证了播种的正常进度和质量。
