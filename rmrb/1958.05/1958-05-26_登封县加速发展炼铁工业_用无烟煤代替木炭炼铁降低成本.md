Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 25th. In the past, Dengfeng County, Henan Province, used charcoal as fuel for indigenous iron smelting methods, resulting in very high production costs. In mid-May, Chen Xueyi, a worker at the Mayu Iron Smelting Plant, after painstaking research, created a record of smelting iron with anthracite coal in one firing, reducing costs by 76%, increasing iron output by 20%, and the quality of the iron was pure, fine, and bright. This experience is of great significance for reducing iron smelting costs and will therefore be widely promoted in the county's iron smelting industry.

    登封县加速发展炼铁工业
    用无烟煤代替木炭炼铁降低成本
    据新华社郑州25日电　河南省登封县过去土法炼铁都是采用木炭作燃料，产品成本很高。5月中旬，马峪炼铁厂工人陈学义经过刻苦钻研后，创造了用无烟煤炼铁一炉火即成的纪录，降低成本76％，提高出铁率20％，铁的品质纯洁、细亮。这一经验对于降低炼铁成本有很大意义，因此将在全县炼铁业中广泛推广。
