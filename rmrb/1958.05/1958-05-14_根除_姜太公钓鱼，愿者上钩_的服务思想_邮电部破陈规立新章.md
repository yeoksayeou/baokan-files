　　Eradicating the "Jiang Taigong Fishing, Those Who Are Willing Take the Bait" Service Ideology
    Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications Breaks Old Rules and Establishes New Regulations

    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, at its four-level cadre meeting held from April 20th to May 12th, formulated many new measures to ensure warm and thoughtful service to the people and socialist construction, fundamentally changing the past "Jiang Taigong fishing" service ideology and "bureaucratic" style of work.
    "Jiang Taigong fishing, those who are willing take the bait" was the title of a representative big-character poster at this four-level cadre meeting of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. Like the more than nine thousand big-character posters posted at the meeting, this big-character poster sharply exposed the conservative thinking of the leaders of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications in serving the masses and the problems existing in the regulations, systems, and work style of the postal and telecommunications departments. The representatives attending the meeting, focusing on improving service thinking, engaged in vigorous airing of views and debates, and reviewed the main work and major measures of the postal and telecommunications departments over the past eight years.
    While affirming the achievements of the past eight years, the meeting also criticized right-leaning conservatism, dogmatism, and empiricism in leadership. Since correcting the deviation of forced distribution in newspaper and magazine distribution work in 1953, the leadership of the postal and telecommunications departments has developed right-leaning conservative ideas such as fearing to make mistakes and not striving to be first or lagging behind. For example, in newspaper and magazine distribution, in order to avoid repeating the mistake of forced distribution, excessive emphasis was placed on voluntarism, and no initiative was taken to actively develop business; in the development of postal and telecommunications networks and communication equipment, there was also a passive "cooking according to the menu" attitude; and in promoting the advanced experience of the agricultural cooperative postman system, because some difficulties were encountered, the promotion was not persisted in. At this meeting, some representatives sharply criticized the leadership for being "once bitten by a snake, afraid of a well rope for three years."
    The meeting believed that ideological liberation must be further liberated in order to achieve further leaps forward in work. The main link in postal and telecommunications work at present is to first achieve a major leap forward in service thinking and create a new situation in which political ideology takes command in all work. In order to ensure better service to the people, the meeting determined the 1958 leap forward plan; decided to decentralize some of the management authority unnecessarily controlled by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to the provincial, municipal, and county post and telecommunications bureaus; discussed the preliminary plan proposed by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to revise some unrealistic and unreasonable regulations and systems; and advanced producers and county post office directors attending the meeting also put forward proposals and guarantees for better serving the masses. The 1958 leap forward plan for postal and telecommunications work was determined.
    According to Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, subscribing to newspapers, sending letters, and making remittances are now more convenient than in the past. The postal and telecommunications departments, in the rectification movement, have accepted the opinions of the broad masses and have begun to revise unreasonable clauses in more than 130 regulations and systems. Some have already been implemented.
    The first to be revised were those old rules and bad habits that the masses found most inconvenient. Some of them had been in use for decades. In the past, postal workers would never fill out forms, affix stamps, or write letters on behalf of illiterate users, no matter how much they requested. Now this old rule has been broken.
    In the past, newspaper subscriptions had to be for whole months or whole seasons, the subscription date had to fall on the 1st or 6th of the month, and there was no door-to-door subscription service; withdrawals had to be made at the designated post and telecommunications bureau, and could not be cashed at nearby post offices; telegrams were not delivered at night; and parcels were not delivered to the door. The masses had the most opinions on these regulations and systems, which were closely related to the masses and were obviously unreasonable. This time, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications resolutely made revisions to all those that could be revised immediately, and some have already been implemented. In the future, newspaper and magazine subscriptions will not only break the quarterly and monthly restrictions, but can also be started and stopped at any time according to the needs of the readers, and readers can also subscribe to newspapers and magazines by letter or telephone, or make reservations for retail sales. Rural postmen can also collect newspaper and magazine subscriptions door-to-door. Remittances can be flexibly cashed at nearby post offices according to the actual situation. The system of delivering telegrams at night and delivering parcels to the door has also been restored. In the past, the business hours of post offices in various places were all based on the unified regulations of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and were the same as the office hours of general agencies. Post offices opened when people went to work, and the doors of post offices closed when people got off work. The masses reflected: "It's not like a post office, it's simply a yamen!" Now the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has decided to decentralize this part of the management authority so that the post and telecommunications bureaus in each province, city, or county can adapt to local conditions and use it flexibly according to the different conditions in each place.
    Some regulations and systems were reasonable in the past, but now, due to the basic completion of socialist transformation in our country and changes in the economic base, some regulations and systems are no longer applicable. For example, can big-character posters, proposals, challenge letters, and reply letters be mailed as "printed matter" or "office documents"? This is a new issue that has emerged in the high tide of the rectification movement and socialist construction. According to the old regulations, only those printed in letterpress or mimeographed in more than 20 copies could be mailed as "printed matter," otherwise they would have to be mailed as letters. This is obviously not suitable for the new situation. These types of regulations and systems have also been revised or supplemented according to the new situation.
    The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will consult with relevant departments on some regulations and systems that involve more issues or have been approved by the State Council. Some regulations involving operational techniques will be carefully studied.
    In the "double anti" movement, about 30% of the big-character posters received by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications from the general public and postal and telecommunications workers involved regulations and systems. The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications examined and analyzed the opinions of the masses, and after discussion, found that the reasons for the unreasonableness of some regulations and systems were: in the past, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications did not arrange the relationship between politics and economy, politics and business well, saw things but not people, and did not put politics in command. Some regulations and systems that were no longer suitable for the development of new productive forces and were outdated were not revised in time. When formulating regulations and systems, more consideration was given to the convenience of the work of the postal and telecommunications departments themselves, and less consideration was given to the convenience of the masses; in some systems, there was more passive prevention and less attention was paid to the consciousness and creativity of the masses.

### 根除“姜太公钓鱼，愿者上钩”的服务思想  邮电部破陈规立新章

　　根除“姜太公钓鱼，愿者上钩”的服务思想
    邮电部破陈规立新章
    据新华社13日讯　邮电部在4月20日到5月12日召开的四级干部会议上，制订了许多新的措施，保证热情周到地为人民群众和社会主义建设服务，从根本上改变过去存在的“姜太公钓鱼”的服务思想和“衙门”作风。
    “姜太公钓鱼，愿者上钩”，这是这次邮电部四级干部会议上一张有代表性的大字报的题目。这张大字报和会议上贴出的九千多张大字报一样，尖锐地揭发了邮电部领导在为群众服务方面的保守思想和邮电部门规章制度、工作作风中存在的问题。参加这次会议的代表以改进服务思想为中心，大鸣大放，展开了辩论，并且检查了八年来邮电部门的主要工作和重大措施。
    在肯定八年来工作成绩的同时，会议也批判了领导上的右倾保守、教条主义和经验主义思想。邮电部门自从1953年纠正报刊发行工作中的强迫摊派的偏向以后，从邮电部门的领导上就产生了怕犯错误、不争先也不落后等右倾保守思想。譬如在报刊发行方面为了怕再犯强迫摊派的错误，过分强调自愿，不去主动积极发展业务；在发展邮电网路和通信设备方面，也是消极地“看菜吃饭”；在推广农业合作社邮递员制度这项先进经验时，因为碰到一些困难，便没有坚持推广。这次会议上有的代表尖锐地批判领导上是“一旦被蛇咬，三年怕井绳”。
    会议认为必须在思想上解放再解放，才能在工作上跃进再跃进。邮电工作当前的主要环节是，首先在服务思想上来个大跃进，创立一个政治思想在全部工作中挂帅的新局面。为了保证更好地为人民服务，会议确定了1958年的跃进规划；确定将一部分不必要由邮电部统一掌握的管理权下放到各省市和县的邮电局；讨论了邮电部提出的修改部分脱离实际的不合理的规章制度的初步方案；参加会议的先进生产者和县邮局局长等还在会上提出了更好地为群众服务的倡议和保证条件。确定了1958年邮电工作跃进规划。
    据新华社13日讯　订报、寄信、汇兑比过去更加方便了，邮电部门在整风中接受广大群众的意见，着手修改了一百三十多项规章制度中的不合理条款。有的已经开始实行。
    这次首先修改的是那些最使群众感到不方便的陈规陋习。其中有些是沿用了几十年的老规矩。过去邮局的职工不管有些不识字的用户如何要求，绝不代填单据、贴邮票、或写信。现在把这个老规矩打破了。
    过去订报纸一定要订整月整季的，起订的日期一定逢一逢六，又不上门收订，取汇款一定要在指定的邮电局，不能在附近邮局兑取；夜间邮局不送电报；包裹不送上门。对这些和群众关系比较密切而又显然不合理的规章制度，群众意见最多。这次凡是能够立刻修改的，邮电部都坚决作了修改，有的已经施行。以后，订报纸杂志不但破季破月，还可以根据读者需要随时起随时止不受限制，读者也能写信或打电话订报订杂志，或预约零售。乡邮员还能上门收订报纸杂志。汇款可以根据实际情况通融在附近邮局支取。夜间送电报和包裹送上门的制度也恢复了。过去各地邮局的营业时间都根据邮电部的统一规定，和一般机关的办公时间一样，人们上班了，邮局才开门，人们下班了，邮局的门也关了。群众反映：“那里像邮局，简直是衙门！”现在邮电部决定把这部分管理权下放，以便各省市或县的邮电局根据各地不同条件因地制宜，灵活运用。
    有一部分规章制度，过去是合理的，现在由于我国社会主义改造基本完成、经济基础发生变化，某些规章制度就不再适用了。譬如大字报、倡议书、挑战书、应战书能不能按“印刷品”或“事务文件”邮寄？这是整风运动和社会主义建设高潮中出现的新问题。若按旧规章，只有铅印或油印在二十份以上的，才能按“印刷品”寄，否则都要按信件邮寄。这显然不适合新的情况。这一类的规章制度，这次也都根据新的情况作了修改或补充。
    还有一些牵涉较多，或曾经国务院批准实行的规章制度，邮电部都要和有关部门协商。有些涉及操作技术方面的规程，将要慎重研究。
    在“双反”运动中，邮电部收到的一般群众和邮电职工的大字报，涉及规章制度的，约占30％。邮电部检查和分析了群众意见，并且经过讨论，找出造成部分规章制度不合理的原因是：过去邮电部对于政治和经济、政治和业务的关系没有安排好，见物不见人，没有政治挂帅。对于一些不适合新的生产力发展早已陈旧过时的规章制度，没有及时修改。在制订规章制度时，从邮电部门本身的工作方便考虑多，从方便群众考虑少；在某些制度中消极防范多，忽略了群众的自觉性和创造性。
