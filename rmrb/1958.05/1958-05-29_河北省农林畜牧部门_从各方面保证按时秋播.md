    Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Departments of Hebei Province
    Guarantee Timely Autumn Planting from All Aspects

    (Our Dispatch) The agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry departments of Hebei Province have begun to arrange production work in advance to prepare for a bumper agricultural harvest next year.

    The focus of the preparatory work for a bumper agricultural harvest next year in Hebei Province is to guarantee the timely sowing of summer harvest crops from all aspects. Now, the planning department of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has formulated a planting plan for summer harvest crops based on the province's overall production increase plan for next year. The provincial agricultural technology department has formulated ten technical measures to strive for increased wheat production. The Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry's Seed Bureau convened a provincial seed meeting to study and arrange for the development of mass wheat variety evaluations and the selection and retention of one billion jin of high-quality summer sowing crop seeds during the summer harvest. In addition, adapting to the new conditions of water conservancy and massive increases in fertilizer production, the Land Utilization Division of the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has dispatched three working groups to assist eight key counties in conducting soil surveys to prepare for large-scale soil improvement before sowing. To increase animal power for agricultural production next year, the Provincial Animal Husbandry Department has formulated a breeding plan to increase the number of draft animals by one million. It has also dispatched two working groups to hold on-site promotion meetings in two key counties to promote breeding measures of full mating, full accuracy, full production, and full survival for breeding-age female animals. The Provincial Machinery Bureau has also drafted a plan to increase the supply of machinery and equipment and expand the service area of agricultural machinery.
