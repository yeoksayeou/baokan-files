Title: The So-Called "Strong Tea" and "Plain Water" Controversy

In social science circles, especially in the fields of literature and history, there is a prevailing argument called "strong tea and plain water." Some people compare ancient things to strong tea, relishing them endlessly, finding their taste inexhaustible. But when it comes to modern and contemporary things, they find them uninteresting, like a glass of plain water. It seems as if their "valuing the past over the present" is simply due to their interests. At first glance, it seems reasonable, but in reality, it is a colossal lie. They hope to conceal the essence of the struggle between "valuing the present over the past" and "valuing the past over the present" as a struggle between two paths under the guise of the "strong tea and plain water theory," reducing the significant meaning of "valuing the present over the past." No wonder, after the idea of "valuing the present over the past" was proposed, some people sang the tune of "valuing the present, why necessarily belittle the past?" You can "value the present," and I can "value the past." Different people have different preferences for strong tea and plain water, so why force uniformity?

Is "valuing the past over the present" really just a simple matter of their interest in "strong tea" and belittling "plain water"? To answer this question, we might as well go to the ancient cave shrouded in the fog of "valuing the past over the present" to see what is really going on.

First of all, the masters of "valuing the past over the present" rely on the dead for their livelihood and fortune (in reality, they still depend on the living to grow food for them). There are two main paths for them to make a fortune from the dead: one is "exploring unpopular areas," and the other is "clinging to the tail of a famous horse." "Exploring unpopular areas" means studying problems that are far removed from current needs and that no one else studies, such as "The History of Gambling in China," "Did Sima Qian suffer castration or execution?" and so on. Since no one else studies it, he is naturally "the number one in the world" in this field. Once fame comes, wealth will follow. "Clinging to the tail of a famous horse" means studying a certain great celebrity or a great work of ancient times, wholeheartedly trying to make a name for himself from the dead, so as to gain immortality along with this great celebrity or this great work. Moreover, the dead cannot speak, so you can manipulate them as you please. But you can’t do that when it comes to modern learning. On the one hand, it is closely related to the current class struggle, and on the other hand, you must serve the people wholeheartedly, or at least put in hard work, without being able to take shortcuts. No wonder the masters of "valuing the past over the present" say that modern and contemporary things have too strong a political flavor and too much "meat," and they are not used to eating this bowl of "meat rice," but want to eat light "vegetarian rice" without political flavor. On the surface, it looks like a devout old vegetarian woman, but in reality, their greed for fame and wealth is just like a hungry wolf. Therefore, mentioning "valuing the present over the past" is like breaking their cherished rice bowl and robbing them of their parents who provide food and clothing, causing them great distress.

Secondly, in politics, the masters of "valuing the past over the present" mainly escape from reality, and some even use the past to resist the present. They are dissatisfied with the revolutionary reality, so they have to escape to ancient times to "take refuge," trying to divide the world equally with socialism based on their capital in the ancient academic field and socialist politics. Someone said, "Agricultural production in the Song Dynasty was more developed than it is now," meaning that our current collectivization has no superiority; saying that "officials in the past wanted to become officials in order to follow the dao, but when the ideal is realized, they should retire," implying that the Communist Party should step down. Someone, when lecturing students on "Journey to the West," said of Sun Wukong's havoc in the Heavenly Palace: "Sun Wukong disliked the position of弼马温 being too small, just like the demands of intellectuals"; when lecturing on "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," they talked a lot about the feudal integrity of "three visits to the thatched cottage" and "a scholar dies for his confidant." Obviously, "the drunkard's intention is not in the wine," and they are very good at using their scholarship to serve capitalist politics.

Thirdly, in the spiritual realm and cultural life, they despise reality and find everything around them unpleasant, "a solitary lamp, a cup of strong tea, an ancient book," going to ancient books to find spiritual and cultural sustenance.

The science of history, a discipline of class struggle, is not comparable to tea drinking, but must serve a certain class and politics. Engaging in ancient history is also for political service. Using ancient history and modern history to distinguish whether there is political nature in historical research is just a smokescreen, trying to divert people's attention. These people are essentially using ancient history to serve the bourgeoisie. Therefore, the dispute between "valuing the past over the present" and "valuing the present over the past" is by no means a dispute between "strong tea" and "plain water," but an unadulterated struggle between two paths.

We want social science to serve the current revolutionary struggle and socialist construction; while the masters of "valuing the past over the present" want the ancients to serve their individualism, and in the final analysis, they want social science to serve capitalism. That's all there is to it, what else could there be? We must not be deceived by this "strong tea and plain water theory."

    所谓“浓茶”和“白水”之争
    敢峰
    在社会科学界，特别是在文史方面，流行着一种论调，叫做“浓茶和白水”。有人将古代的东西比为浓茶，津津乐道，其味无穷；而对近代和现代的东西，就觉得索然无味，如同一杯白水。仿佛他们之所以“厚古薄今”是简单地由于兴趣所致。乍看起来也好像有理，实际上这是一个弥天大谎。他们就正是希望在“浓茶白水论”的掩盖下，偷换“厚今薄古”与“厚古薄今”之争是两条道路之争的实质，降低“厚今薄古”的重大意义。难怪在提出“厚今薄古”以后，有人就高唱“厚今何必薄古”的论调，你可以“厚今”，我也可以“厚古”，浓茶白水各有所喜，何必强求一致呢？
    “厚古薄今”，果真只是简单地由于他们喜“浓茶”而薄“白水”的兴趣主义吗？为了回答这个问题，我们不妨先到“厚古薄今”这个迷雾笼罩的古洞里去看一个究竟。
    首先，“厚古薄今”的大师们是靠死人吃饭，靠死人发家的（实际上还是要靠活人种粮食给他们吃）。他们靠死人发家的道路主要有二，一曰“钻冷门”，二曰“附骥尾”。“钻冷门”就是去研究离当前需要十万八千里谁也不去研究的问题，比如“中国赌博史”、“司马迁受的是宫刑还是死刑”、等等。别人不去研究只有他一个人去研究，当然在这一门内他就是“老子天下第一”，名来了也不愁利不来。“附骥尾”就是研究古代的某一个大名人或某一部大作品，一心一意想在死人身上搞出一点名堂，好随这位大名人或这部大作品而得到不朽，而且死人不会说话，任凭你如何摆弄。搞现代的学问，那可不能这样，一则与当前阶级斗争的关系密切，二则要全心全意为人民服务，至少也要付出辛勤的劳动，偷不得巧。难怪“厚古薄今”的大师们说，近代和现代的东西，政治气味太浓，“荤味”太重，他们吃不惯这碗“荤饭”，而要吃没有政治气味的清淡的“素饭”。表面看来真好像是一个虔诚的吃斋的老太婆，而实际上对名利的贪馋，却简直像一只饿狼一样。因此，一提“厚今薄古”，就好像打碎了他们的如意饭碗和抢走了他们的衣食父母那样心痛。
    其次，在政治上，“厚古薄今”的大师们主要是逃避现实，有的人甚至是以古抗今。他们对革命的现实不满，因此只好逃到古代去“避难”，企图凭据自己在古代学术阵地上的本钱和社会主义的政治来平分秋色。有人说“宋代的农业生产比现在还发达”，意思就是指我们今天的合作化并没有什么优越性；说“伃家要作官是为了行道，但理想实现了，则应隐退”，影射之意就是要共产党下台。有人给学生讲“西游记”中孙悟空大闹天宫时说：“孙悟空嫌弼马温官小，倒像知识分子的要求”，讲“三国演义”时大讲“三顾茅庐”和“士为知己者死”的封建气节。显然，“醉翁之意不在酒”，他们倒是很会用其学术来为资本主义的政治服务的。
    第三，在精神领域和文化生活里，他们鄙视现实，对周围的一切看不顺眼，“孤灯一盏，浓茶一杯，古书一本”，到古书中去找寻精神和文化生活上的寄托。
    历史科学这一门阶级斗争的学问却比不得茗饮，而是要为一定的阶级与政治服务。搞古代史也是为政治服务。历史研究用古史和今史来区别有无政治性，只是一种障眼法，企图转移人们的视线罢了。这些人实质上是用古史来为资产阶级服务。因此，“厚古薄今”与“厚今薄古”之争绝不是什么“浓茶”与“白水”之争，而是不折不扣的两条道路之争。
    我们要社会科学为当前的革命斗争和社会主义建设服务；而“厚古薄今”的大师们是要古人为他们的个人主义服务，归根结底是要社会科学为资本主义服务。如此而已，岂有他哉！我们千万不要为这种“浓茶白水论”所骗。
