　　Purchasing Scrap Power Machinery to Support the Countryside
    In order to support agricultural production in the suburbs and supply a large number of agricultural machines, the Beijing Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent cadres to factories, enterprises, government offices, and military units in and outside the city to find sources of scrap power machinery. So far, 1,073 units of scrap power machinery, including electric motors, gasoline engines, and automobile engines, have been found, totaling 34,545 horsepower. After repairs, 400 units (4,000 horsepower) of this batch of scrap power machinery have been put into production, which has played a significant role in supporting farmers' spring plowing and sowing. At the same time, the collected old machinery is inexpensive and very popular among agricultural cooperatives. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various places can also do the same.

　　收购废旧动力机支援农村
    为了支援郊区农业生产，大量供应农业机械，北京市供销合作社派出干部分别到市内外工厂、企业、机关和部队等单位寻找废旧动力机械货源。到目前为止，已找到电动机、汽油机、汽车引擎等废旧动力机械一千零七十三台，计三万四千五百四十五马力。这批废旧动力机械经过检修有四百台（四千马力）投入生产，对支援农民春耕播种起到了很大作用。同时收集的旧机械价格低廉，很受农业社的欢迎。各地供销合作社也可以这样做。
