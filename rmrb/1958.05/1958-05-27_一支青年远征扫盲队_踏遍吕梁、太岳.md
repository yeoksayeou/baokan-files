    A youth expedition literacy team held a swearing-in ceremony in Linfen County, Shanxi Province, on the 21st. Afterwards, they went to the remote and culturally underdeveloped areas of the Lüliang and Taiyue Mountains to help local areas carry out literacy work.
    This youth expedition literacy team, consisting of 835 members, is voluntarily composed of young commune members from agricultural cooperatives in the Jinan Plain cotton and wheat producing area and some township and commune cadres. They have a high degree of political consciousness and a cultural level of higher primary school or above.
    This youth expedition literacy team plans to eliminate all illiteracy in the seven counties of Anze, Pu County, Xiangning, Shilou, Xi County, Ji County, and Yonghe within a year. After arriving in the mountainous areas, they will mainly rely on the income earned from their own participation in labor production to live.

    一支青年远征扫盲队
    踏遍吕梁、太岳
    一支青年远征扫盲队21日在山西省临汾县举行誓师大会以后，分别到偏僻的吕梁山、太岳山文化落后的地区帮助当地进行扫盲工作。
    这支拥有八百三十五名的青年远征扫盲队，是由晋南平原棉麦产区农业社的青年社员和部分乡、社干部志愿组成的。他们具有较高的政治觉悟和高小以上文化水平。
    这支青年远征扫盲队计划在安泽、蒲县、乡宁、石楼、隰县、吉县、永和等七个县，用一年内的时间扫除当地全部文盲，他们到达山区以后，将主要依靠自己参加劳动生产所得的收入来生活。（新华社）
