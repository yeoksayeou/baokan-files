Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 4th—The United States, Britain, and France submitted notes to the Soviet government on the 3rd, rejecting the Soviet Union's proposal on April 26 to allow the ambassadors of Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the diplomatic talks preparing for the summit conference.

The Western notes indicated that they could accept another method proposed by the Soviet Union, namely, that the ambassadors of the three Western countries hold separate talks with the Soviet Union to prepare for the summit conference.

The Western notes also stated that the ambassadors' talks should discuss the agenda of the summit conference before discussing the date, location, and members of the foreign ministers' meeting.

    美英法复照苏联
    仍愿分别同苏联会谈
    新华社4日讯　华盛顿消息：美、英、法三国3日向苏联政府提出照会，拒绝苏联在4月26日向它们提出的让波兰和捷克斯洛伐克两国大使参加筹备最高级会议的外交会谈的建议。
    西方的照会表示可以接受苏联所建议的另一种办法，即由西方三国大使分别同苏联进行会谈，来筹备最高级会议。
    西方照会还说，大使们的会谈要在讨论了最高级会议议程以后，才可以讨论外长会议的日期、地点和成员的问题。
