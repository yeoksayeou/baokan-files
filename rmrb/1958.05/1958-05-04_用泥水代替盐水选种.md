    Why?

    Using Muddy Water to Replace Salt Water for Seed Selection
    This year, some areas are using muddy water to replace salt water for seed selection. The purpose of seed selection is to select the strong and robust millet grains to be used as seeds. Strong and robust millet grains are heavier (have a higher specific gravity). Therefore, people judge the quality of the millet based on its specific gravity.
    The simplest way to judge the specific gravity of each millet grain is to immerse it in water to see if it sinks or floats. Because anything in a liquid will sink if its specific gravity is greater than that of the liquid; otherwise, it will float. However, the specific gravity of water is relatively small, and some millet grains that are not robust enough may still exceed the specific gravity of water and sink, making it difficult to determine that all the millet grains that sink in water are strong and robust.
    If we put some salt in the water, the specific gravity of the water will increase after the salt dissolves. At this time, some millet grains that can sink in fresh water but are still not good enough will not be able to sink in salt water.
    There are many ways to increase the specific gravity of water. In addition to adding salt, you can also add mud. Because after the mud dissolves, the specific gravity of the water will also increase. Therefore, using muddy water for seed selection, like using salt water for seed selection, can determine the quality of millet based on its specific gravity. However, it is more difficult for mud to dissolve in water; most of it is suspended in the water in the form of small particles, so it easily sinks. In this way, the upper part of the water will have a reduced specific gravity. Therefore, when using muddy water for seed selection, it is important to stir it frequently to prevent the mud from settling.
    Muddy water is much cheaper than salt water, which can save a lot of salt. Therefore, using muddy water for seed selection is also a very good method.

### 用泥水代替盐水选种

专栏：为什么？

    用泥水代替盐水选种
    今年有些地区用泥水代替盐水来选种。选种的目的，就是把那些长得比较结实健壮的谷子选出作为种子。结实健壮的谷子的分量都较重，（比重较大。）因此人们就根据谷子的比重来判断它的好坏。
    判断每颗谷子比重的大小最简便的方法就是把它浸在水中看它是沉还是漂。因为任何东西在液体中，如比重大于该液体便下沉；反之，就漂。不过水的比重较小，一些还不够结实的谷子也可能超过水的比重而下沉，因此就难于断定下沉在水中的谷子都是结实健壮的。
    如果我们在水中放些盐，盐化后水的比重就增大，这时一些在清水中虽能下沉但仍不够好的谷子，在盐水中就不能下沉了。
    提高水的比重的方法有很多种，除了放盐外，也可以放泥。因为泥化掉后，水的比重也要增大。因此用泥水选种和用盐水选种一样都能从比重上来断定谷子的好坏，不过泥化在水中较困难，大部分都是以小颗粒的形式悬混在水中，所以很容易沉下去。这样，上部的水就要减轻比重，所以用泥水选种要注意经常搅动，不让泥沉淀下去。
    泥水比盐水便宜得多，可以节省大量的盐，所以用泥水选种也是一种很好的方法。
