    The "Swan Lake" Rehearsed by Beijing Dance School
    The famous large-scale ballet – "Swan Lake" will be officially performed by the Beijing Dance School in July this year.
    Since late February this year, the Beijing Dance School has begun rehearsing this large-scale ballet, which requires more than one hundred people to perform, under the guidance of the Soviet ballet master Gusev. Inspired by the current great leap forward situation, all teachers and students have brought into play their revolutionary vigor, which has greatly shortened the rehearsal schedule and will advance the official performance date by more than a year from the original plan.
    The picture shows the pas de deux of the White Swan and the Prince in "Swan Lake". Bai Shuxiang, a fifth-grade student of Beijing Dance School, plays the White Swan, and Liu Qingtang, a teacher of the school, plays the Prince.

    北京舞蹈学校排练的“天鹅湖”
    著名的大型芭蕾舞剧——“天鹅湖”将在今年7月份由北京舞蹈学校正式演出。
    北京舞蹈学校自今年2月下旬在苏联芭蕾舞大师古雪夫的指导下开始排练这个需要一百多人演出的大型芭蕾舞剧。全体教师、学员在当前大跃进形势的鼓舞下，都发挥了革命干劲，终于使排练日程大大缩短，并将使正式演出日期较原计划提前一年多。
