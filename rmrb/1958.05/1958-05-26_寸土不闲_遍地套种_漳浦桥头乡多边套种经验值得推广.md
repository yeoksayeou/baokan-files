	Make Full Use of Every Inch of Land, Diversified Intercropping Everywhere
	The Multi-Layered Intercropping Experience of Qiaotou Township, Zhangpu, is Worth Promoting
	(Our report) According to the Fujian Daily: "Break through conservative barriers, change old habits, muster full energy, and intercrop everywhere." This is the battle cry put forward by the Qiaotou Township Party Committee of Zhangpu County regarding intercropping work. Within half a month, the entire township intercropped more than 3,300 mu of miscellaneous grains such as soybeans, sorghum, June white beans, mung beans, red beans, and kidney beans, and more than 1,600 mu of green manure. It is estimated that the yield of miscellaneous grains can be increased by 200,000 jin, and green manure by 30,000 dan.
	In the past, the habit of Qiaotou Township was to intercrop near the main crop and not to intercrop far away; sweet potato ridges were intercropped, but peanut ridges were not; only one side was intercropped, not both sides (Note: In order not to affect peanut production, it is correct not to intercrop beside the ridges, but it can be intercropped in the ditches). When the promotion and deployment of diverse intercropping and multi-sided intercropping were carried out, some commune members said, "One clump grows and another dies, intercropping wastes seeds." Some believed that this year's dense planting was short of fertilizer, and further intercropping would be terrible. The Party Committee decided to conduct debates in every commune and team. Through detailed accounting, comparing efforts, and reasoning, especially summarizing practical examples, some of the masses' old-fashioned ideas were dispelled. According to the experience of veteran farmers, each commune adopted the method of intercropping high-yield crops (mainly sorghum) on fertile paddy fields, intercropping miscellaneous grains on poor farmland, and intercropping green manure on sweet potato fields, which not only did not affect the main crops, but also increased production.
	In order to encourage commune members' enthusiasm for intercropping, agricultural cooperatives adopted the method of collective land (including orchards, peanuts, sweet potatoes, etc.) being collectively planted and harvested by the production team; scattered land, reclaimed land, garden plots, and corners in front of houses and alleys being planted and harvested by individuals. Tasks were assigned layer by layer by team and household. With the above measures, everyone was full of energy.

### 寸土不闲　遍地套种  漳浦桥头乡多边套种经验值得推广

    寸土不闲　遍地套种
    漳浦桥头乡多边套种经验值得推广
    本报讯　据福建日报消息：“冲破保守关，改掉旧习惯，鼓足干劲，遍地套种”。这是漳浦县桥头乡党委会对套种工作提出的战斗口号。全乡在半个月内，共套种了黄豆、高粱、六月白、绿豆、红豆、菜豆等杂粮三千三百多亩，绿肥一千六百多亩。预计可增收杂粮二十万斤、绿肥三万担。
    桥头乡以往的习惯是套种近地，不套种远地；番薯畦套种，花生畦不套种；只套种一边，不套种两边（按：为了不影响花生产量，畦旁不套种是对的，但可套种在沟中）。当宣传布置多样套种、多边套种时，有的社员说：“一丛生一丛死，套种多花籽”。有的认为今年密植缺肥，再套种还了得。党委会决定在社社队队开展辩论。通过算细账、比干劲、据理辩论，特别是总结实际例子，把一些群众的守旧思想打掉了。各社根据老农经验，采取水田良地多套种高产作物（主要是高粱），农地瘦田多套种杂粮，番薯田多套种绿肥的办法，既不影响主种作物，又能增加生产。
    为鼓励社员套种积极性，农业社采取集体的土地（包括果树、花生、番薯等土地）由生产队集体种、集体收；零星的土地、开荒地、园头园尾、厝前巷角，由个人种、个人收。并按队、户层层分配任务。采取以上措施，大家劲头十足。
