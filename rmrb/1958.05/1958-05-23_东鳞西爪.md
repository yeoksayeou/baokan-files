　　Glimpses of the East, Fragments of the West

　　Boiling Sugar from Yellow Hair Grass Roots
　　Ma Shichu (Miao nationality), a cadre from the Commerce Bureau of Jishou County, Hunan Province, in order to save grain from all aspects and find substitutes for sugar production, discovered in a mountain treasure hunt that the wild plant Yellow Hair Grass roots, which are widely produced, have a very strong sweet taste. He immediately picked and processed them to test-produce sugar, with a sugar extraction rate of 12.5%. The sugar residue can also be used to feed pigs. The Jishou County Commerce Bureau is preparing to mass-produce this sugar for making pastries.

　　Activated Carbon Made from Peanut Shells
　　The Luzhou Battery Factory in Sichuan Province has successfully manufactured activated carbon using peanut shells. Previously, activated carbon relied on imports, costing 5,000 yuan per ton. The activated carbon manufactured by the Luzhou Battery Factory using peanut shells only costs 500 yuan per ton. The air battery lamp made by this factory using its own activated carbon is the same as that made with imported activated carbon. (Guo Daqi)

　　Papermaking with East Cogongrass
　　Papermaking cooperatives in Dongmen, Zhangfang, and other places in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, have successfully trial-produced paper using East Cogongrass. Every hundred pounds of East Cogongrass can produce more than thirty pounds of fine pulp. Paper made from this pulp mixed with bamboo and hemp pulp has good quality.

　　Boiling Cocoons with Infrared Rays
　　The Hangzhou Hulin Silk Factory has successfully used infrared rays to boil cocoons and has officially put it into production.
　　Using infrared rays to boil cocoons can improve the quality of raw silk and save raw materials. It is estimated that if silk reeling factories across the province promote this method, they can create more than 1.77 million yuan in wealth this year.

　　The basic principle of using infrared rays to boil cocoons is to use the heat effect generated by the electromagnetic waves emitted by infrared rays and their penetrating power to substances, so that the contact points of sericin inside and outside the cocoon receive the same heat energy, thereby making the sericin swell, soften, and become uniform, which is conducive to silk reeling.

    黄毛草根熬糖
    湖南省吉首县商业局干部麻世初（苗族），为了从各方面节约粮食寻找代用品制糖，在山区探宝中发现了生产面广的野生植物黄毛草根甜味很浓，即采摘加工试制成糖，出糖率12.5％，糖渣还可以喂猪。吉首县商业局正准备大量生产这种糖做糕点。
  花生壳制活性炭
    四川省沪州市电池厂利用花生壳制造活性炭成功。以前活性炭是靠进口，每吨要五千元，而沪州电池厂用花生壳制造的活性炭，每吨只要成本五百元。这个厂用自制的活性炭做的空气电池灯和用进口的活性炭制的一样。　（郭大旗）
    东茅草造纸
    湖南省浏阳县东门、张坊等地造纸合作社，利用东茅草造纸试制成功。每百斤东茅草可制成三十多斤细嫩的纸浆。用这种纸浆混合竹麻纸料，制造出来的纸品质良好。
    红外线煮茧
    杭州虎林丝厂用红外线煮茧成功，并已正式投入生产。
    利用红外线煮茧，可以提高生丝质量和节约原料。据计算，全省缫丝厂推行这一方法后，今年就可多创造一百七十七万多元的财富。
    红外线用于煮茧的基本原理，是借红外线所放射的电磁波而产生的热效应和对物质的穿透性，使蚕茧内外层丝胶的胶着点接触同等的热能，从而使丝胶澎化、软和、均匀，有利于缫丝。
