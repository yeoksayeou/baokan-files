    Xinhua News Agency, Beirut, May 28th: Fighting continues between Lebanese insurgents and government forces. Government forces are attempting to retake areas controlled by the insurgents. It is reported that on the 27th, government forces used U.S.-made mortars to shell insurgents in Tripoli, with fierce fighting from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The fighting continues. "Radio Free Lebanon" broadcast on the morning of the 28th that after two days of fierce fighting, the insurgents completely defeated the government forces and occupied the entire city of Baalbek. The radio station said that the insurgents now control the cities of Tripoli, Halba, Mina, and Baalbek.

    Under the continuous attacks of the insurgents, the pro-Western Lebanese government, in addition to continuing to rely on the United States to intensify suppression, is playing deceptive tricks in an attempt to politically divide the opposition parties. In a statement broadcast on the radio on the 27th, Prime Minister Solh said that his government "has not, does not, and will not want to amend the constitution. The government will never propose such an amendment."

    Although their policy stances are not entirely the same, almost all opposition parties oppose Chamoun's re-election. These parties include the National Front led by former Prime Ministers Yafi and Salam, the Arab Liberation Party and the People's Front led by former Prime Minister Karami, the League of Parties led by Oueini, the Supporters' Party, as well as the Constitutional Party of Khoury, the Socialist Progressive Party of Jumblatt, and Faraon's "Third Force," etc. These parties have not yet formed a unified organization or established a unified action program in their joint action against Chamoun's re-election.

    Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 28th: Damascus Radio reported that the National Front, composed of Lebanese opposition figures, delivered a memorandum to the U.S., British, and French ambassadors to Lebanon on the 27th, protesting against their governments' interference in Lebanon's internal affairs by helping the Chamoun government, and demanding that they pay attention to the consequences of such interference.

    The memorandum pointed out, "Your governments have no reason to take a hostile attitude towards a national movement that is purely an internal matter."

    Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Yafi also condemned on the 27th the governments of the Baghdad Pact countries for transporting weapons and military equipment to the Lebanese government to oppose the insurgents.

    民族阵线抗议美英法干涉黎内政
    据新华社28日讯　贝鲁特消息：黎巴嫩的起义人民部队同政府部队的战斗正继续进行。政府部队企图夺回被起义人民控制的地区。据报道，政府军在27日用美国制造的迫击炮轰击的黎波里起义人民，双方从上午九时激战到下午三时。战斗还在继续。“自由黎巴嫩电台”28日晨广播，经过两天激战后，起义人民完全打败了政府部队，占领了巴尔贝克全城。这家电台说，起义人民部队现在控制了的黎波里、哈勒巴、米纳和巴尔贝克等城市。
    在起义人民的接连打击之下，黎巴嫩亲西方政府除了继续依靠美国加紧镇压行动以外，正在玩弄欺骗手段，企图在政治上分化反对党派。总理索勒哈27日在电台广播的一篇声明中说，他的政府“过去、现在和将来都不想修改宪法。政府决不会提出这种修正”。
    尽管政策主张不尽相同，差不多所有的反对党都反对夏蒙连任。这些党派包括前总理雅非和萨拉姆领导的民族阵线、前总理卡拉米领导的阿拉伯解放党和人民阵线，乌埃尼领导的各党派联盟，支持者党，以及扈利的立宪党、琼布拉特的社会主义进步党和法拉昂的“第三力量”等。这些党派在反对夏蒙连任的共同行动中还没有结成统一的组织和订出统一的行动纲领。
    据新华社大马士革28日电　大马士革电台报道，由黎巴嫩各反对党派人士组成的民族阵线27日向美国、英国和法国驻黎巴嫩的大使递交一份备忘录，对他们的政府通过帮助夏蒙政府的办法来干涉黎巴嫩的内政表示抗议，并且要求他们注意承担这种干涉所产生的后果。
    备忘录指出，“你们的政府没有理由对纯粹是内部问题的民族运动采取敌对态度。”
    反对党领袖、前总理雅非27日也谴责巴格达条约各国政府向黎巴嫩政府运送武器和军事装备以反对起义人民。
