    Exciting "Water"

    Just as the film title indicates, the theme of "Water" is exceptionally clear and prominent. The story takes place in 1947, with a rear hospital of our Northwest Field Army transferring in the desert, followed by enemy cavalry. From the moment the transferring stretcher team appears on the sandy beach, the entire film's thread, the appearance of each character, and the development of each specific plot are closely linked to water and the struggle for water. This team is hurrying to get away from the enemy; it seems they have been walking for days. Everyone's lips are cracked, the critically ill patients are on the verge of death, the villagers carrying the stretchers are having difficulty lifting their feet, and people are constantly collapsing. At this time, everything depends on the support of several escorting medical personnel. How much they need water!
    The arrangement of the plot and the depiction of the characters are meticulous and true to life. At the beginning of the film, the eye sees an endless desert, with the unique whirlwinds of the desert rolling hot sand and whistling past. The whole picture gives a feeling of suffocation and heaviness. There are few human voices and dialogues.
    Suddenly, an old villager falls down, Water! Water! Several people shouted at the same time... A wounded soldier with injuries to his head and lower limbs insists on giving his little donkey to the villager who just fell. So, they start moving again, walking and walking, and finally his gunshot wound flares up again, and he contributes his life because it is too late to save him. When he dies, he is still silent, but the audience will feel that behind this silence lies a revolutionary's clear rationality and noble feelings! Just as the comrades are preparing to bury him on the dune, someone suddenly discovers a tree standing far away in front! Water, water; finally there is a source – and it is at this time that the film reaches its climax, unfolding a life-and-death struggle with the enemy for water. In the unfavorable situation where the enemy has an absolute advantage, it shows the People's Liberation Army's high degree of courage, resourcefulness, and tenacious fighting spirit, and finally defeats the enemy, defeats death, the enemy becomes our prisoner and sends us horses. At the end of the film, the sky is still covered with white clouds, and in front is still the boundless desert, but we have finally broken a bloody path.
    In addition to reflecting that the People's Liberation Army is a brave and tenacious force, the film also shows the flesh-and-blood relationship between the people's army and the masses. It is a moving film with great educational significance.
    The film's shortcomings are that the portrayal of the characters is not deep enough. For example, the image of the instructor is relatively simple and superficial, and does not leave a deep impression on the audience.
  It is said that this film is adapted from an article in the "Thirty Years of徵文" (Solicited Essays) of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. We sincerely hope that playwrights and comrades engaged in film work can bring more and more of the rich and magnificent epic of the thirty years of the Chinese revolutionary struggle to the stage and the screen. This will be work of great significance.

    激动人心的“水”
    彭启良
    正像影片片名所标示的一样，“水”的主题异常鲜明突出。故事发生在1947年，我西北方面军的一个后方医院在敌骑兵队的尾随下正在沙漠中转移。从转移的担架队出现在沙壁滩上开始，整个影片的线索，每一个人物的出现，以及每一个具体情节的发展都与水以及和水的斗争紧紧地联系着。这支队伍为了摆脱敌人，大家急行，看来已有几天了；个个人的嘴唇都已干裂，重病员已奄奄一息，挑担架的老乡们已举足困难，不时有人昏倒过去。这时全靠几个护送的医务人员在撑持着。他们多么需要水呀！
    剧情的安排和人物的刻划都丝丝入扣、纯朴真实。影片开始时，眼前是一望无垠的沙漠，沙漠中所特有的阵阵旋风卷着热沙呼啸而过。整个画面给人以窒息、沉重感觉。人的声音和对话都是不多的，……。
    突然一个老乡倒下去了，水！水！同时几个人喊着……一个头部和下肢受伤的伤病员坚持要把自己的小毛驴给刚才倒下去的老乡骑。于是，他们又开始移动起来，走呵，走呵，最后他的枪伤又发作了，终于因来不及挽救而贡献了自己的生命。死的时候，他仍然是默默的，然而观众会感到在这默默的后面埋藏着一个革命者多么清醒的理智和高尚的感情！同志们正准备在沙丘上安葬他时，突然有人发现在前面遥立着一棵树！水，水呀；终于有了源泉了——也就在这个时候影片掀起了高潮，展开了和敌人争水的你死我活的斗争。处在敌人绝对优势的不利情况下，表现出了我人民解放军高度的勇敢、机智和顽强的斗争精神，终于战胜了敌人，战胜了死神，敌人作了我方的俘虏并给我们送来了马匹。在影片尾声时，天上仍然白云复盖，前面仍然是无边的沙漠，但我们终于杀出了血路。
    影片除了反映我人民解放军是一支英勇顽强的部队以外，还表现了人民的军队和群众的血肉关系，这是一部极富教育意义的动人的影片。
    影片的缺点是对人物的刻划还不够深刻，例如指导员的形象就比较简单、肤浅，给观众的印象不深。
  据说，这部影片是根据中国人民解放军三十年征文中的一篇改编的，我们真诚地期望着剧作家和从事电影工作的同志们能够更多更多地把中国革命斗争三十年来丰富而瑰丽的史诗搬上舞台和银幕。这将是具有巨大意义的工作。
