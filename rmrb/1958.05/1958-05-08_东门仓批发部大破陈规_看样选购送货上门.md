Dongmencang Wholesale Department Breaks with Convention
Sample Selection and Door-to-Door Delivery

(Our dispatch) Reporter Lin Yao reports: The Dongmencang Wholesale Department of the Beijing Municipal General Merchandise Wholesale Company has boldly broken away from all unreasonable rules and regulations, changing the "contract supply" method to "sample selection" and "door-to-door delivery." It has made significant achievements in meeting market needs and promoting production development, becoming an advanced banner among wholesale units nationwide.

The Dongmencang Wholesale Department is a wholesale station that combines wholesale and warehousing, responsible for the commodity supply of more than 1,800 general merchandise retail stores in Beijing and the storage of all general merchandise. I recently visited this wholesale department to learn about their implementation of "sample selection." Upon entering the gate, it felt like a bustling department store. In a large rectangular yard, nearly 10,000 kinds of daily-use general merchandise were neatly displayed on glass cabinets and merchandise shelves. Each commodity was marked with its name, specifications, origin, wholesale price, and retail price. This is the wholesale department's "sample room." Retail store buyers come here to select goods based on samples. After selecting suitable commodities, they issue invoices and make payments here, and then go to the warehouse in the back to pick up the goods. Buying one or two items takes only ten minutes to complete the entire purchasing process; large-scale selections also only take one or two hours. The purchase of goods here is not subject to any "wholesale starting point" restrictions. Small stores with limited funds want to stock more varieties but in smaller quantities of each, so the wholesale department unpacks the goods and sells them in threes or fives, meeting the requirements of retail stores for frequent purchases and quick sales, and accelerating capital turnover. For new commodities that are in high demand in the market but not available in the wholesale department, the wholesale department relays the opinions of retail stores to the procurement department to discuss arrangements for production with factories, and assists factories in solving production difficulties in terms of raw materials and technology. This has played a positive role in improving the product quality and adding varieties of local industry. For products that are needed in the market but cannot be produced locally, the wholesale department procures them from other regions. Therefore, since the implementation of sample selection, this wholesale department has increased the number of new varieties by more than 1,500 in just seven categories of commodities: towels, socks, bed sheets, enamelware, rubber shoes, underwear, and steel products. For some commodities that are unpopular in the market and have not been selected for a long time, the wholesale department reflects this to the factory through the procurement department and asks the factory to make improvements.

While implementing "sample selection," this wholesale department also implemented a "door-to-door delivery" supply method for more than 600 retail stores, solving the difficulty for some small and medium-sized retail stores that do not have the manpower to come to the wholesale department to purchase goods frequently. Every morning, the staff of the wholesale department's outreach team carry samples to department stores in various districts to let them select goods based on samples. After the stores have selected and determined the varieties, specifications, and quantities of the commodities they need to purchase, the outreach team brings them back to the wholesale department, and the next day the goods are delivered to the door, and people are sent to collect the money. In this way, retail stores can buy the commodities that customers need in a timely manner without purchasing staff. During the high tide of the commercial Great Leap Forward, this wholesale department came up with many more ways to facilitate retail stores, such as telephone ordering, door-to-door sales (that is, carrying a large number of commodities to retail stores and selling them on the spot after they have been selected), night business, and so on.

However, a year ago, when "contract supply" was implemented, the relationship between the wholesale and retail links was very tense, and people's hands and feet were bound by unreasonable rules and regulations. At that time, a supply conference was held every quarter, where retail units submitted their demand plans, and the wholesale department balanced them, signed contracts, and then picked up the goods on a monthly basis. When signing the contract, the retail units did not see the goods, but "bought goods based on the ledger," which was quite blind. In addition, market needs changed very quickly. The commodities needed when the contract was signed were no longer needed or not needed so much after a month or two, and some commodities might not be enough. At this time, if the retail department wanted to increase or decrease commodities, it had to re-order or amend the contract, which was a very complicated procedure, and it took a long time to approve and finalize an amendment. Also, when signing contracts, it often happened that retail departments arranged the purchase time inappropriately, or although the arrangement was appropriate, the wholesale department could not supply them at that time, so there was an abnormal phenomenon in the market where "sweaters came in autumn and woollen clothes came in winter."

In addition, there was a provision in the past that "original packaging delivery" must be implemented, and the wholesale department could not unpack the goods for supply. Some stores with small funds could not buy this if they bought that; if a commodity was bought back in a whole box, the quantity was too large, and the funds were tied up because it could not be sold for a while. The number of links in the delivery procedure was also astonishing. At that time, each delivery of goods had to go through seven links, and it took four days to get the wholesale department's goods to the counter and meet customers. As for the manpower and material resources wasted for signing, amending, and storing contracts, it is impossible to count.

The leading cadres and all the staff of the Dongmencang Wholesale Department realized in the second half of 1956 that these unreasonable rules and regulations should be boldly broken. They put forward the slogan of "liberating ourselves from the contract." After Vice Premier Chen Yun proposed at the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China that selection and purchase could be implemented between industry and commerce and between wholesale stations at higher and lower levels, they were the first to boldly abolish the "contract supply" method and all the rules and regulations that arose from this method, implemented "sample selection," and constantly improved the shortcomings in the process of practice, making it increasingly perfect.

    东门仓批发部大破陈规
    看样选购送货上门
    本报讯　记者林耀报道：北京市百货批发公司东门仓批发部大胆摆脱一切不合理的规章制度，将“合同供应”的方法改变为“看样选购”和“送货上门”的供应方法后，在满足市场需要，促进生产发展等方面作出了显著成绩，成为全国批发单位中的一面先进旗帜。
    东门仓批发部是一个批发和仓库合一的批发站，担负着北京全市一千八百多户百货零售商店的商品供应和全部百货商品的保管任务。记者不久前到这个批发部去了解他们实行“看样选购”的情况，一走进大门好像到了一个热闹的百货商场，在一个规模很大的口字形的货场里，玻璃柜和商品架上整整齐齐地陈列着近一万种日用百货商品。每一种商品上都注明着品名、规格、产地、批发价格、零售价格等项目。这就是批发部的“样品间”。零售商店的采购员到这里看样选货，挑选到合适的商品后，就在这里开票、付款，然后到后面仓库去取货。买一两笔货，只要十多分钟就完成了全部购货手续；大宗选购时也只要一、二个小时就行了。在这里选购商品还不受什么“批发起点”的限制，资金不多的小商店要想多进几种花色品种而每种数量少些，批发部就拆开整装，三件、五件地出售，满足了零售商店勤进快销、加速资金周转的要求。有些市场很需要而批发部又没有的新商品，批发部就把零售店的意见反映给进货部门，以便和工厂协商安排生产，并且从原料、技术等方面协助工厂解决生产上的困难，这样对提高地方工业的产品质量和增添花色品种都起了积极的促进作用。有些市场需要但本地不能生产的产品，批发部门就向外地采购。因此这个批发部自实行选购后，仅毛巾、袜子、床单、搪磁、胶鞋、内衣、钢精制品七类商品就增加了一千五百多种新品种。有些商品在市场上不受欢迎，长期无人选购，批发部就通过进货部分反映给工厂要求工厂加以改进。
    在实行“看样选购”的同时，这个批发部还对六百多户零售商店实行了“送货上门”的供应办法，解决了一些中小型零售商店没有人力经常到批发部来购货的困难。每天早晨，这个批发部外勤组的工作人员就携带样品到各区百货商店去让他们看样选货，商店经过挑选，确定了所需购进的商品的品种、规格、数量以后，外勤组带回批发部，第二天就把货物送到门上，并派人上门收款。这样零售店不用采购人员也可以及时买到顾客需要的商品。在商业大跃进的高潮中，这个批发部更想出了很多办法给零售店以方便，如电话要货、上门兜售（就是携带大批商品送到零售店去，挑选好了就当场出售）、夜间营业等等。
    但是在一年以前实行“合同供应”的时候，批发、零售两个环节的关系十分紧张，人们被不合理的规章制度束缚住了手脚。那时每一季度要开一次供应会议，由零售单位提出要货计划，批发部门加以平衡、签订合同，然后按月提货。在签订合同时，零售单位并没有看到商品，而是“看账买货”，因此带有不少盲目性。加之市场需要变化很快，签订合同时需要的商品，一两个月后就不需要或者不要那么多，有的商品又可能不够，这时零售部门要想增加或减少商品，必须重新补订合同或修改合同，手续十分繁杂，修改一次合同要很长时间才能审批定案。在签订合同时也经常发生零售部门把进货时间安排得不恰当或者安排得虽恰当，到时批发部门供应不上的情况，因此市场上就出现了“秋来汗衫到、冬去绒衣来”的反常现象。
    另外过去还有一条规定，就是要实行“原装提货”，批发部门不能拆箱供应，有些资金小的商店，买这种就不能买那种；一种商品整箱买回去后数量太多，一时又销不出去积压了资金。提货手续环节之多也十分惊人，当时每提一次货要经过七道环节，需要四天时间才能把批发部的商品拿到柜台上和顾客见面。至于为签订、修改和保管合同而浪费的人力物力更是无法统计。
    东门仓批发部的领导干部和全体职工在1956年下半年就意识到这种不合理的规章制度要大胆地加以打破，他们提出了要“从合同里解放出来”的口号，陈云副总理在中共第八次全国代表大会上提出工商之间和上下级批发站之间可以实行选购的指示后，他们第一个大胆地废除了“合同供应”方法以及随这种方法产生的一切规章制度，实行了“看样选购”，并且在实践过程中不断改进缺点，使其日臻完善。
