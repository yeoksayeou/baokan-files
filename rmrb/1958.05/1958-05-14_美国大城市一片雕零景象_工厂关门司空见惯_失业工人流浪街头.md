Xinhua News Agency, May 13th Dispatch from New York: The "Nation" magazine recently published several articles describing the unemployment situation in several major American cities as follows:

　　Los Angeles

　　This city has 172,500 unemployed workers. A year ago, the city's unemployment rate was 2.9% of the total workforce, but now it has increased to 6.5%. This is just the figure for fully unemployed workers, not including the underemployed. As industrial production, especially in the aircraft and automobile industries, continues to shrink, the situation will not improve.

　　St. Louis

　　According to official materials from the St. Louis Employment Security Office, as of March 1st, the total number of unemployed in the city was 71,800. However, "these statistics should be considered conservative, as they are based solely on official sources. Hundreds of small businesses have not provided such statistics. These materials also do not reflect the economic impact of the recession on tens of thousands of people who, although employed, can only work three or four days a week."

    "Survey materials indicate that hundreds of families in St. Louis are experiencing poverty. The breadwinners of these families are unemployed, all savings have been used up, unemployment benefits have been exhausted, or they simply do not have the right to receive unemployment benefits... All of this has resulted in a state of poverty in St. Louis unprecedented in nearly twenty-five years." "Currently, the ranks of unemployed waiting for relief from charitable organizations in St. Louis are constantly expanding, and some local observers are concerned that if the recession continues to develop, the situation will further deteriorate."

　　Boston Area

　　In the entire state of Massachusetts, where the major American city of Boston is located, 7.5% of the labor force is unemployed. In Gloucester, about one-fifth of the workers are roaming the streets, while in Lawrence, more than one-tenth of the workers are roaming the streets. The situation is even more dismal in other parts of the state.

　　Detroit

　　Unskilled and semi-skilled industrial workers are most affected by unemployment, and young, energetic workers are also often laid off. With the development of the recession, Detroit is now not only an automobile industry center with an operating rate of less than 50%, but also a city with a desolate landscape and only symbolic factories.

    The economic hardship experienced by the unemployed in the recession is also increasing. Thousands of workers in many automobile factories in Michigan who have been working for more than ten years have been laid off. They have lost the various welfare benefits they should have been entitled to and probably have no hope of returning to the factory.

    Now that the entire country is in a state of economic recession, the unemployed in Michigan and Detroit have nowhere to turn. This is the same for both black and white workers.

### 美国大城市一片雕零景象  工厂关门司空见惯　失业工人流浪街头

　　美国大城市一片雕零景象
    工厂关门司空见惯　失业工人流浪街头
    据新华社13日讯　据塔斯社纽约讯：“民族”周刊最近刊载几篇文章，描述美国几个大城市的失业情况如下：
　　洛杉矶
　　这个城市有十七万二千五百名失业工人。在一年以前，这个城市的失业人数占工人总数的2.9％，而现在已增加到6.5％。这还只是全失业工人的数字，其中不包括半失业的工人。由于工业生产，特别是飞机和汽车工业的生产在继续缩减，因此情况将不会好转。
　　圣路易
　　据圣路易就业保险局的官方材料，到3月1日为止，这个城市的失业人数总共为七万一千八百人。但是“这些统计材料应当被认为是保守的，因为这些材料只是以官方消息来源为基础。数以百计的小企业并没有提供这种统计材料。这些材料也不反映经济衰退在经济上对成千上万的这样一些人的影响：这些人虽然有工作，但每周只能工作三、四天。”
    “调查材料表明，圣路易数以百计的家庭经受着贫困。这些家庭的赡养人失业了，所有的积蓄都用光了，失业救济金也花光了，或者根本就没有领失业救济金的权利……这一切的结果是造成圣路易人近二十五年来前所未有的贫困状态”。“目前圣路易等待慈善机关救济的失业者的队伍正在不断扩大，当地的一些观察家耽心，如果衰退继续发展，情况将进一步恶化”。
　　波士顿地区
　　美国大城市波士顿所在的整个马萨诸塞州，有7.5％的劳动力是失业者，格罗斯特约有五分之一的工人流浪街头，而劳伦斯有十分之一以上的工人流浪街头。这个州的其他地区，情景更加凄惨。
　　底特律
　　不熟练和半熟练的产业工人受失业的影响最大，年青的精力充沛的工人也常常遭到解雇。随着衰退的发展，底特律目前不仅是一个开工率不到50％的汽车工业中心，而且还成了一个景象雕零、只有象征性工厂的城市。
    失业者在经济衰退中所经受的经济困难也日益加剧。密执安州许多汽车厂中成千的、已有十多年工龄的工人被解雇，他们丧失了在福利方面本应享有的种种权利，并且大概已经没有回厂的希望。
    现在全国各地都处在经济衰退的状况中，密执安州和底特律的失业者走投无路。这对黑人工人和白人工人都是一样。
