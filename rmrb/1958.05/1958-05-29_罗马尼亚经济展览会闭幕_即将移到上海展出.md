During the month it was exhibited in Beijing, the exhibition received nearly 500,000 visitors. Vice Chairman Zhu De and Premier Zhou Enlai visited the exhibition and wrote inscriptions for it.

The Romanian Economic Exhibition also received letters from industrial departments in Anhui, Shandong, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Liaoning, and other provinces, requesting information and pictures of various new machine tools, agricultural machinery, and mining machinery. Some industrial departments have already ordered some machines based on the exhibits at the exhibition.
