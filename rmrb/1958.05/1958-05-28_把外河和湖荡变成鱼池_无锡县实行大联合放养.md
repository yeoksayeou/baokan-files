Turning Outer Rivers and Lakes into Fishponds: Wuxi County Implements Large-Scale Joint Stocking

    (Our dispatch) Jiangsu's Wuxi County has adopted an advanced measure of joint fish farming, transforming all the county's outer rivers and lakes into a large fishpond. The stocked area has increased from over 46,000 mu to over 100,600 mu, with a planned annual output of over 8.4 million jin.
    The Wuxi County Party Committee decided in mid-March that all the outer river and lake areas of the county would be jointly operated by state-owned breeding farms, agricultural cooperatives, and fishery cooperatives through joint-stock management, unified stocking, unified management, and unified distribution. Specialized agencies were established at the county and township levels to lead this work.
    Adopting large-scale joint fish farming demonstrates the enormous superiority of organization. Summarized, there are ten major benefits. First, natural resources are fully utilized, truly achieving "fish filling the ponds," enabling the state and the masses to increase their annual income from the original 500,000 yuan to 2.5 million yuan. Second, the contradictions between the state, agricultural cooperatives, and fishery cooperatives in utilizing the water surface are completely resolved. Third, the number of screens and barriers originally planned for 600 has been reduced to 93, and the original need for 1 million jin of mao bamboo is now only over 300,000 jin, greatly saving capital. Fourth, over 300 laborers are saved from guarding the screens and barriers. Fifth, with the entire water surface unified, the phenomenon of fish escaping is greatly reduced, and the contradictions between cooperatives caused by fish escaping in and out are eliminated; the range of fish activity is wide, and growth is also fast. Sixth, in terms of transportation and shipping, the troubles of shipping are reduced, avoiding damage to the screens and barriers by ships and disputes with fish farming units. Seventh, large-scale joint stocking reduces the number of openings and shortens the defense line, which is convenient for management. Eighth, the difficulty of insufficient technical strength is resolved. Ninth, planned production properly resolves the contradictions between outer pond and inner pond fish farming, planting water chestnuts, and accumulating fertilizer, which is conducive to the comprehensive development of agricultural and sideline production. Tenth, the problems of breeding and protection are fundamentally solved, and output is increased.

    把外河和湖荡变成鱼池  无锡县实行大联合放养
    本报讯　江苏无锡县采取联合养鱼的先进措施，把全县外河和湖荡变成一只大鱼池，放养水面从四万六千多亩增加到十万零六千多亩，计划年产量八百四十多万斤。
    中共无锡县委在3月中旬决定把全县所有的外河和湖荡水面由国营养殖场、农业社、渔业社三者合股经营，统一放养，统一管理，统一分配。县乡建立专门机构，领导这项工作。
    采取大联合养鱼，显示了组织起来的巨大优越性。归纳起来共有十大好处。第一，充分利用了自然资源，名副其实地做到成鱼满塘，国家和群众因此全年可在原来五十万元收益的基础上增加到二百五十万元；第二，彻底解决国家、农业社、渔业社三者之间利用水面的矛盾；第三，帘箔由原规划六百座减少到九十三座，原来需要一百万斤毛竹现在只要三十多万斤就够了，大量节省了资金；第四，节省看管帘箔的劳力三百多人；第五，水面全部统一，逃鱼现象大大减少，社和社之间因鱼逃出逃进所起的矛盾消除了，鱼类活动范围广成长也快；第六，在交通航运方面，减少航运上的麻烦，避免船只损坏帘箔和养鱼单位的纠纷；第七，大联合放养，口门少，防线缩短，便于管理；第八，解决技术力量不足的困难；第九，有计划地生产，妥善解决外荡和内塘养鱼、种菱、积肥等矛盾，有利农副业生产全面发展；第十，从根本上解决繁殖保护问题，提高产量。
