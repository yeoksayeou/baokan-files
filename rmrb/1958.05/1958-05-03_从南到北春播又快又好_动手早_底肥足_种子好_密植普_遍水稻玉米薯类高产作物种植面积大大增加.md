Spring Planting from South to North is Fast and Good
    Starting Early, Sufficient Base Fertilizer, Good Seeds, Widespread Close Planting
    The Planting Area of High-Yield Crops Such as Rice, Corn, and Potatoes Has Increased Greatly
    (Our Newspaper News) The spring planting of grain crops in the Northeast countryside has begun on a large scale. So far, the whole country has entered a period of intense spring planting. Across the vast motherland, from south to north, rice seedling cultivation and transplanting, potato seedling cultivation and planting, and the sowing of major autumn grain crops such as corn, sorghum, and millet are all proceeding at a speed never seen before.
      In late April, after widespread welcome rains in the Yellow River and Huai River basins, local farmers were working hard to carry out crash sowing. Some areas in the south of Guizhou and Guangxi are still experiencing spring drought and lack of rain, and northern Hebei still feels that the rainfall is insufficient. These areas are conducting large-scale drought resistance and rush planting.
    In Guangdong and Sichuan, more than 45 million mu of early rice had been transplanted by late April. The early transplanted rice has already begun to be weeded, about half a month earlier than in previous years. In Guangxi, more than 80% of the early rice has been transplanted, most of the rice in Fujian has been transplanted, and it will soon be completed. Early rice in southern Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces has also been transplanted. Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, and the Dongting Lake area of ​​Hunan are transplanting early rice seedlings. In southwestern Sichuan and other provinces, mid-season rice transplanting has begun. In Nanchong, Suining and other regions of Sichuan, more than 80% has been transplanted. The mid-season rice seedling cultivation work in the provinces along the Yangtze River has been mostly completed. Some areas south of the Yangtze River have begun to cultivate late-season rice seedlings.
    This year, Jiangsu and northern Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, and Northeast provinces have converted dry land to paddy fields, greatly expanding the area under rice cultivation. At present, newly developed rice growing areas in northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, Henan, and Shandong are all preparing land and cultivating seedlings. Seedlings in Xinxiang, Kaifeng, Xuchang, Shangqiu and other regions of Henan are growing very well and can be transplanted around May 10. Seedling cultivation has also begun in areas south of the Songhua River in Northeast China. In Andong, Yingkou and other counties in Liaoning Province, seedlings cultivated in hotbeds or nutrient pots are already two to three inches high. In the colder Xinbin, Qingyuan and other counties, rice seedlings are being cultivated in the open air with oil paper covering.
    The spring sowing of major autumn crops such as corn and sorghum across the country is progressing faster than in previous years and has now entered its peak. Spring corn in southern Shandong and sorghum in the west have been sown, and millet is being sown. More than half of the 45 million mu of autumn grain crops in Shanxi Province have been sown. Early autumn crops in Henan have basically been sown. The sowing of early autumn crops in Shaanxi Province has generally begun. Hebei Province, with the method of large-scale support and cooperation, mobilized the masses to crash plant while fighting drought. Support and cooperation are generally from plains to mountainous areas, and from areas that complete sowing earlier to support those that complete sowing later. Due to the organization of collaboration, the strength of drought resistance and sowing has been greatly strengthened, and the speed has been accelerated. In Tangshan region, the number of people mobilized for rush planting every day reached more than 2.8 million, and more than 900,000 mu could be planted in one day.
    The sowing of potatoes and major autumn crops in southern provinces is also very fast. In Nanchong region of Sichuan Province, sweet potatoes have been planted in advance. More than 7 million mu of corn have been planted in Guizhou Province. Early and mid-season corn in Guangxi have been completely planted and are growing luxuriantly. The early planted corn has already flowered. Anhui Province has planted 2.27 million mu of spring corn, exceeding this year's planting plan. The sowing of field crops in Liaoning Province, Northeast China, is basically over. As of April 26, Jilin Province had planted more than 6.3 million mu and is currently advancing at a rate of more than 1 million mu per day. It is expected to be completed around May 20. Large-scale sowing has also generally begun in Heilongjiang.
    This year's spring planting across the country is generally ten days to a month earlier than in previous years. Sufficient base fertilizer and good seeds are the characteristics of this year's spring planting. Close planting and improved varieties have been promoted more widely.
    More than one-third of the counties in the country this year will strive to achieve "four, five, and eight" ahead of schedule. Therefore, the planting area of ​​the three high-yield crops of rice, corn, and potatoes has been greatly expanded in this year's spring planting. According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, the rice area across the country can be expanded by more than 111.52 million mu this year, the corn area can be expanded by more than 23.28 million mu, and the potato area can be expanded by more than 64.69 million mu. The smooth completion of spring planting and the expansion of high-yield crops will lay a good foundation for a great leap forward in grain production this year. (Attached pictures)

    从南到北春播又快又好
    动手早  底肥足  种子好  密植普
    遍水稻玉米薯类高产作物种植面积大大增加
    本报讯　东北农村粮食作物的春播大规模展开了。至此，全国进入了春播的紧张时期。辽阔的祖国从南到北，水稻的育秧和插秧，薯类的育苗和栽种，玉米、高粱、谷子等大秋粮食作物的播种，都正以往年没有过的速度飞快地进行着。
      4月下旬，黄河和淮河流域普降喜雨后，当地农民就紧张地突击播种。南方的贵州和广西部分地区依然春旱缺雨，河北北部仍感雨量不足，这些地区正进行大规模的抗旱抢种。
    广东和四川的四千五百多万亩早稻到4月下旬就已经插完了秧，早插的已经开始耘田了，比往年提早了半月左右。广西的早稻插了80％以上，福建插了大部，很快就可插完。浙江、江西等省南部的早稻也已经插完。江苏、安徽、湖北和湖南洞庭湖区正在插早稻秧。西南四川等省中稻已经开始插秧，四川南充、遂宁等专区已插了80％以上。长江流域各省中稻育秧工作大部已经完成。长江以南部分地区已经开始育晚稻秧。
    今年江苏和安徽北部、河南、山东、河北、陕西和东北各省旱改水，扩大水稻种植的面积很大。现在，苏北、皖北、河南、山东新发展水稻的地区都正在整地和育秧。河南新乡、开封、许昌、商丘等专区的秧苗都生长很好，5月10日左右就可插秧了。东北松花江以南地区也开始育秧了。辽宁省安东、营口等县用温床或营养钵育的秧已有两三寸高。新宾、清原等县较冷，就在野外采用油纸覆盖育秧。
    全国玉米、高粱等大秋作物的春播进展比往年为快，现在已经进入高潮。山东南部的春玉米和西部的高粱都种完了，正在播种谷子。山西省大秋粮食作物四千五百多万亩已经播种过半。河南的早秋作物基本上已经种完了。陕西省播种早秋作物已经普遍开始。河北省以大支援大协作办法，发动群众突击抗旱抢种。支援协作一般是平原支援山区，季节早的完成播种后支援季节晚的。由于组织协作，大大加强了抗旱播种的力量，加快了速度。唐山专区每天出动抢种的人数达二百八十多万，一天可种九十多万亩。
    南方各省薯类和大秋作物的播种也很快。四川省南充专区已经提早栽插甘薯。贵州省的玉米已种了七百多万亩。广西早、中玉米全部种完，生长茂盛，早种的已经出顶花了。安徽省已种了二百二十七万亩春玉米，超过了今年的种植计划。东北辽宁省大田作物播种基本结束。吉林省到4月26日种了六百三十多万亩，目前每天以一百万亩以上的速度前进着，预计5月20日左右可以种完。黑龙江大田播种也普遍开始了。
    今年全国春播普遍提早十天到一个月不等。底肥足、种子好是今年春播特点。密植和良种都推广得较普遍。
    全国有三分之一以上的县今年要争取提前实现“四、五、八”。因此，今年春播中水稻、玉米、薯类三项高产作物的面积扩大很多。据农业部最近的统计，全国水稻面积今年可扩大一亿一千一百五十二万多亩，玉米可扩大二千三百二十八万多亩，薯类可扩大六千四百六十九万多亩。春播的顺利完成和高产作物的扩大种植，将为今年粮食生产大跃进奠定良好的基础。（附图片）
