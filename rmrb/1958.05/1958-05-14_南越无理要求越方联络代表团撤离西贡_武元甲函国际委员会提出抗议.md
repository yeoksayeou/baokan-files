　　South Vietnam Unreasonably Demands the Withdrawal of the Vietnamese Liaison Delegation from Saigon
　　Vo Nguyen Giap Sends Letter to International Commission to Protest
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th:  According to the Vietnam News Agency, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, wrote to the Chairman of the International Commission on May 8th to protest the South Vietnamese authorities' demand that the Vietnam People's Army withdraw its liaison delegation stationed at the International Commission in Saigon.
    The South Vietnamese authorities recently notified the International Commission that if members of the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation in Saigon did not comply with South Vietnam's unreasonable decision before May 15th, South Vietnam would "reserve the right to take all measures they deem necessary within the current legal framework."
    Vo Nguyen Giap pointed out in his protest that "whether the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation continues to remain in Saigon cannot be based on the unilateral decision of the South Vietnamese authorities."
    Vo Nguyen Giap said that the establishment and continued maintenance of a liaison delegation by the Vietnam People's Army in Saigon was based on the protocol signed on March 31, 1955, by the Vietnam People's Army and the French Federal Forces, which also represented the South Vietnamese authorities at the time. Moreover, the establishment and continued maintenance of this delegation was formally requested and recognized by the International Commission. He referred to a letter written by the South Vietnamese Liaison Delegation on June 22, 1956, which agreed to guarantee the safety of the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation stationed in Saigon. He emphasized: "The South Vietnamese authorities are legally and factually responsible for the safety of the work and actions of the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation in Saigon."
    General Vo Nguyen Giap reiterated that the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army fully supports the constructive opinion of the International Commission regarding the need for both parties to consult in order to reach an agreement on this issue.
    He said: Before both parties hold a meeting to resolve all issues related to maintaining the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation in Saigon and the South Vietnamese Liaison Delegation stationed in Hanoi, the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army hopes that the International Commission will vigorously and promptly intervene to prevent the South Vietnamese authorities from creating new difficulties for the Vietnam People's Army Liaison Delegation stationed in Saigon.

　　南越无理要求越方联络代表团撤离西贡
　　武元甲函国际委员会提出抗议
    新华社河内13日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南人民军总司令武元甲将军在5月8日写信给国际委员会主席，就南越当局要求越南人民军方面从西贡撤回它派驻国际委员会的联络代表团一事提出抗议。
    南越当局最近曾通知国际委员会说，如果在西贡的越南人民军联络代表团的团员不在5月15日以前履行南越的无理决定的话，南越将“保留在目前法律范围内采取他们认为必要的一切措施的权利”。
    武元甲在抗议中指出，“越南人民军联络代表团是否继续留在西贡决不能根据南越当局的单方面决定。”
    武元甲说，越南人民军在西贡设立和继续保持一个联络代表团，是以越南人民军和当时也代表南越当局的法兰西联邦部队在1955年3月31日所签订的议定书为根据的。而且，这个代表团的设立和继续保持是国际委员会所正式要求和承认的。他提到了南越联络代表团在1956年6月22日所写的一封信，这封信同意保证驻西贡的越南人民军联络代表团的安全。他强调说：“南越当局在法律上和事实上应该对越南人民军联络代表团在西贡的工作和行动的安全负责。”
    武元甲将军再次强调，越南人民军总司令部完全赞成国际委员会关于双方有必要进行协商以便就这个问题达成协议的建设性意见。
    他说：在双方还没有举行会议来解决有关在西贡保持越南人民军联络代表团以及南越在河内派驻联络代表团的一切问题之前，越南人民军总司令部希望，国际委员会大力和及时地进行干涉，以防止南越当局可能对驻西贡的越南人民军联络代表团制造新的困难。
