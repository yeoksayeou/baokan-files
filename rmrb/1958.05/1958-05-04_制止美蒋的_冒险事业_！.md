Halt the US-Chiang "Adventure"!
    By Our Staff Commentator

    On April 30, Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda issued a statement presenting new evidence of the activities of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group in supporting the Indonesian rebel groups. The statement pointed out that recently the United States and Chiang Kai-shek elements have helped rebel groups bomb some areas of Indonesia. The pilots flying the planes for the rebel groups are Americans and members of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and the gasoline used by the planes is also supplied by the US-Chiang group. The Indonesian government also has ample evidence proving that from April 25 to 30, the US-Chiang group smuggled shoulder-fired automatic weapons and fighter jets to the rebels from Taiwan.

    After these ironclad facts were revealed, U.S. government officials still tried to quibble. On the same day, Eisenhower shamelessly rehashed the platitude that the United States pursued a policy of "neutrality" toward Indonesia. He even described the U.S.'s blatant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs as an "adventure" of certain individuals in the United States. The next day, Dulles came out to echo his president's fallacies. But no one will believe these lies. We ask, do "individual actions" exist in the world where American pilots fly American planes to bomb the territory of another country? Dulles also said that the U.S. government "has no obligation to control activities of this nature by Americans." This statement confessed the true intention of the United States, which is that it still does not intend to stop this interference and attempts to continue recklessly.

    These facts of American interference in Indonesia and the arrogant attitude of the Dulles clique toward Indonesia tell people a fact: in the Indonesian people's struggle to defend national independence and unity, U.S. imperialism is the most ferocious enemy. The reason why the United States is intensifying its interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, using the Chiang Kai-shek group, at a time when the rebel forces are on the verge of collapse, is to preserve a last stronghold for the rebel group in another base (North Sulawesi), so that they can continue to threaten Indonesia's independence and allow the United States to fish in troubled waters.

    However, the Indonesian people, determined to defend the freedom and independence of their motherland, will never tolerate this interference by the United States. On May 2, President Sukarno righteously condemned the interference by Americans and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group and warned the United States not to play with fire in Indonesia. At the same time, as Prime Minister Djuanda said in his statement, the activities of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group have aroused strong indignation among the Indonesian armed forces and people. Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit has sent a telegram to the U.S. government strongly protesting the U.S. aid to the rebel groups and demanding that it immediately stop this activity. The 200,000-strong rally celebrating "May Day" International Labor Day held in Jakarta on May 1 passed a resolution firmly opposing foreign interference, demanding decisive measures against the Chiang Kai-shek group, and supporting the government in completely eliminating the rebel groups. Many Indonesian people's organizations have unanimously expressed their support for Prime Minister Djuanda's statement, condemning the despicable interference of U.S. imperialism. The Indonesian people will persevere in their struggle. The rebel group supported by the United States is destined to fail, and the "adventure" of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek group in interfering in Indonesia is bound to go bankrupt.

    制止美蒋的“冒险事业”！
    本报评论员
    4月30日印度尼西亚总理朱安达发表声明，对美国和蒋介石集团支持印度尼西亚叛乱集团的活动，提出了新的证据。声明指出，最近美国和蒋介石分子帮助叛乱集团轰炸了印度尼西亚的一些地区。给叛乱集团驾驶飞机的飞行员是美国人和台湾蒋介石集团分子，飞机使用的汽油也是美蒋集团供给的。印度尼西亚政府并且掌握了充分证据，证明自4月25日至30日的时间里，美蒋集团曾从台湾私运了一些肩荷式自动武器以及战斗机给叛乱分子。
    在这些铁的事实被揭露出来以后，美国政府官员还想进行狡辩，艾森豪威尔在同一天竟毫不脸红地重弹美国对印度尼西亚奉行“中立”政策的滥调。他并且把美国如此粗暴干涉印度尼西亚内政的行为，说成是美国某些个人的“冒险事业”。第二天，杜勒斯又出来为他的总统先生的谬论帮腔。可是这些鬼话是不会有任何人相信的。试问，美国的飞行员驾驶着美国的飞机，去轰炸另外一个国家的国土，难道天下居然有这样的“个人行动”吗？杜勒斯还说，美国政府“没有义务去控制美国人的这种性质的活动”。这句话倒是供认了美国的真正意图，那就是至今仍然不打算停止这种干涉行动，而企图顶着头皮继续蛮干下去。
    美国干涉印度尼西亚的这些事实和杜勒斯之流对印度尼西亚的蛮横态度，告诉人们一个事实：在印度尼西亚人民维护国家独立和统一的斗争中，美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人。美国所以在叛乱分子大势已去的今天，利用蒋介石集团，变本加厉地干涉印度尼西亚内政，是企图在叛乱分子盘踞的另一据点（北苏拉威西），为叛乱集团保住一块最后的阵地，负隅顽抗，以便继续威胁印度尼西亚的独立，使美国有混水摸鱼的机会。
    但是，决心捍卫祖国自由独立的印度尼西亚人民，决不能容忍美国的这种干涉。5月2日，苏加诺总统义正词严地谴责了美国人和台湾蒋介石集团分子的干涉行为，并警告美国不要在印度尼西亚玩火。同时，正如朱安达总理在声明中所说的，美国和蒋介石集团的活动，在印度尼西亚武装部队和人民中间已经产生了强烈的愤慨情绪。印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地已经致电美国政府，强烈抗议美国援助叛乱集团，要它立即停止这种活动。5月1日在雅加达举行的二十万人的庆祝“五一”国际劳动节的大会通过决议，坚决反对外国干涉，要求对蒋介石集团采取断然措施，并支持政府彻底肃清叛乱集团。许多印度尼西亚人民团体一致表示支持朱安达总理的声明，谴责美帝国主义的卑鄙干涉。印度尼西亚人民将会坚持自己的斗争。美国所支持的叛乱集团是决定要失败的，美国和蒋介石集团干涉印度尼西亚的“冒险事业”是一定要破产的。
