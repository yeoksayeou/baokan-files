    The Season of Testing
    ——Impressions of Eliminating the Four Pests in Liuzhou and Qingyuan
    By our correspondent Zhou Jingyu
    Liuzhou is quite satisfactory
    From Nanning to Liuzhou.
    The Liujiang River flows slowly day and night, but the flow of people on the Liujiang pontoon bridge is like a surging wave, carrying mud, moving bricks, flying around, a noisy scene. The Young Pioneer supervisors are all over the main roads, holding fly swatters in their hands, their eyes as big as copper coins, looking for flies everywhere. I saw that almost everyone on the street had a fly swatter in their hand. So, I also bought one.
    I really wanted to use the fly swatter, but after walking through many food stores and restaurants, I couldn't find a single fly. The stalls selling sugar cane were also clean, without even a shadow of a fly.
    Liuzhou is a semi-industrial and semi-agricultural city, how could it be so clean? I found the Liuzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
    The entire municipal committee only had two people: one for receiving and dispatching, and another in the Organization Department handling organizational relationships. The other offices were empty. The comrade in the reception room said that people had gone to eliminate the four pests. After a while, the Deputy Secretary of the Municipal Committee returned. His trouser legs were covered with mud, and his shoes were half wet, so you could tell he had come from the sewage pond construction site. This Deputy Secretary told me: there are basically two problems with eliminating the four pests, one is the problem of mobilizing the masses, and the other is the problem of municipal construction. Mobilizing the masses is relatively easy to do, as long as the elimination of the four pests is combined with the interests of the masses, and the cadres of the organs take the lead, the masses will act quickly; as for municipal construction, the problem is more complicated, such as the transformation of sewage ponds, the reorganization of drainage systems, the reconstruction of private toilets, etc., which cannot be perfected all at once. However, once the masses are mobilized, the complex problems become easier to solve. He said that in the past, some people proposed to eliminate the four pests in four or five years, but it seems that the time is too long. The important thing is to do it in one go, to have several overall battles a year, with the whole city and nearby areas acting in a unified manner, and taking action at the same time, so that the four pests have no chance to breed and multiply. If this can be done, the goal of "four without" can basically be achieved.
    In the evening, I stayed at the Liuzhou Railway Administration Guesthouse. The room was clean and tidy, there were no mosquitoes, and there was no need to hang a mosquito net. I slept especially soundly that night.

    Stories Heard in Qingyuan
    When leaving Liuzhou, I heard that Qingyuan Town in Yishan County was also included in the special zone's "four without" cities. Some people even said that the large restaurants there had posted guarantee notices: "If a fly is found, you don't have to pay for your meal." The hotels there no longer hang mosquito nets. So I came to Qingyuan.
    The person in charge of the town committee told me: the big change in Qingyuan's sanitation work has only happened in the last month. In the past, there were garbage dumps and stinking puddles along the way from the station to the local committee. Flies and mosquitoes flew around freely. After six days and nights of hard work, more than 220 unqualified cesspools and toilets were removed, and more than 1,200 improved toilets were built. Every household mobilized, everyone took action, and then a new atmosphere appeared. He modestly said that Qingyuan Town was still far behind Jinchengjiang in terms of hygiene and eliminating the four pests.
    I walked through several streets and alleys. Although I didn't see any guarantee notices in the restaurants, the overall impression was clean. The slaughterhouse, where flies used to be concentrated, is now also clean. Although a fly occasionally flies in, it is quickly swatted.
    Here, I heard such a thought-provoking story: One day, a traveler went to a restaurant that guaranteed there were no flies. Just as he finished his meal and was about to pay, a fly suddenly flew in. He quickly swatted the fly with his swift hands and eyes. This sounded an alarm to people: One or two sudden attacks can only achieve basic "four without". If you want to achieve complete "four without", you still need to make several efforts.
                          ×　×　×
    Summer is the season of testing the work of eliminating the four pests, especially in southern cities. Despite the great efforts made in winter and the great achievements made, if we don't seize the opportunity to continue the work of eliminating the four pests, then we will not be able to withstand the test of summer. I have lived in several cities in Guangxi and proved that some cities can withstand the test. This is the season's test for the people.

    考验的季节
    ——柳州和庆远除四害印象记
    本报记者　周静宇
    柳州颇如人意
    从南宁到柳州。
    柳江的水，日日夜夜缓缓地流着，而柳江浮桥上的人流却似奔腾澎湃的波涛，挑泥的，搬砖的，飞来走去，闹哄哄地一片。少年监督岗的少先队员，满布在通衢要道，他们手里拿着一把蝇拍，睁着铜钱大的眼睛，到处寻找苍蝇。我看到街上的人们几乎人手一拍。于是，我也买了一把蝇拍。
    我很想发挥一下蝇拍的作用，谁知走了许多食品店和饭店，一只蝇子也没有找到。那些摆小摊卖甘蔗的地方，也是干干净净，连苍蝇的影子也没有。
    柳州是个半工半农的城市，怎么搞得这样干净呢？我找到了中共柳州市委会。
    市委整个机关只有两人，一个收发兼传达，另一个是组织部办理组织关系的，其他办公室都是空空如也。收发室的同志说，人们都去除四害去了。一会儿，市委副书记回来了。他的两只裤管上沾了一些泥巴，鞋子有一半湿透，一看就知道是从污水塘的工地上来的。这位副书记告诉我：除四害基本上有两个问题，一个是动员群众问题，另一个是市政建设问题。动员群众是比较好办的，只要把除四害和群众利益结合起来，机关干部起带头作用，群众就会很快地行动起来；至于市政建设，问题就比较复杂，诸如污水塘的改造，排水系统的整理，私人厕所的改建等等，都不能一下子趋于完善。不过，群众发动起来以后，复杂的问题也就比较好办了。他说，过去有人提出四年五年消灭四害，看来，时间太长了些。重要的在于一鼓作气，一年搞几次总体战，在同一时间内全市和附近地区，统一行动，一齐下手，不让四害有孳生繁殖的机会。能够做到这一点，基本上可以达到“四无”的目的。
    晚上，我住在柳州铁路管理局招待所，屋内清洁整齐，没有蚊子，不用挂蚊帐。这一晚睡得特别香甜。庆远听到的故事
    离开柳州的时候，听说宜山县的庆远镇也列入了专区的“四无”城市。还有人传说那里的大饭店贴上了保证的条子：“如果发现苍蝇，吃了饭可以不给钱。”那里的旅店已经不挂蚊帐了。于是我来到庆远。
    这个镇的镇委负责人告诉我：庆远的清洁卫生工作大变化，只是最近一个月的事。过去，从车站到地委机关沿途都是垃圾堆和臭水坑。苍蝇蚊子到处逍遥自在地飞舞，经过六昼夜苦战，取消了不合格的粪坑和厕所二百二十多个，修建了改良厕所一千二百多间。家家动员，人人动手，才出现了一点新气象。他谦虚地说，庆远镇的讲卫生、除四害比起金城江来还差得多。
    我走过了几条大街和小巷，虽然没有看到饭馆里有什么保证的字条，总的印象是清洁的。过去苍蝇密集的屠宰场，现在也做到一片清洁。虽然偶然飞来一只苍蝇，很快就被扑灭。
    在这里，听到这样耐人寻味的故事：某一天，有个旅客到一家保证没有苍蝇的饭店吃饭，刚吃完饭准备付钱的时候，忽然飞来一只苍蝇，他手轻眼快地立即把那只蝇子打死了。它给人们敲起了警钟：一次突击两次突击，只能做到基本“四无”，要想完全“四无”，还需要作几番努力。
                          ×　×　×
    夏天，是对除四害工作考验的季节，特别是南方城市。尽管冬季花了很大的力气，取得很大的成绩，如果不抓紧时机继续进行除四害工作，那末，就经不起夏季的考验。我在广西住了几个城市，证明有的城市是经得起考验的，这就是季节对于人们的考验。　（苗地插图）（附图片）
