    Remembering Zhang Shu
    Tian Han
    A telegram came from the Guilin Bureau of Culture and Education, saying that they had scheduled the reburial of Comrade Zhang Shu for the 23rd of this month and asked if we wanted to go and inspect it. Because I'm busy, I can't go. Looking at the early summer rain, I recalled the scene when I discovered the tomb of Zhang Shu and his daughter at the foot of Baitou Mountain in Guilin two years ago, which filled me with endless emotion.
    Comrade Zhang Shu died in the Japanese bombing of his residence near Rong Lake in Guilin on February 24, 1938. His eldest daughter, Dada, who loved her father the most, refused to leave him and died with him. She was only four years old. At that time, Comrade Zhang Shu was working in the Music Group of the Sixth Section of the Third Department of the Political Department of the Military Commission (under the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation). After his death, the Third Department buried him on the mountainside near Liangshui Well in Jiangjun Bridge. Guo Moruo, the head of the Third Department at the time, inscribed a tombstone for him, calling it "The Tomb of Musician Zhang Shu and His Daughter." When we returned to Guilin from Changsha, we paid our respects at his tomb. But the second time we went, a factory had been built there, and the tomb was enclosed within the factory. We inquired with the factory, and they said it had been moved to the other side of the mountain. The mountain was very long, and we went to the back of the mountain as they said, and after several twists and turns, we found hundreds of messy graves in a valley, but we couldn't find the tombstone inscribed by Guo Lao. With great difficulty, we found a broken piece of the tombstone with only the two characters "之墓" (zhi mu, "of the tomb") remaining. But I could recognize Guo Lao's handwriting even with just one character, and I finally found the tomb of my old comrade-in-arms. At that time, the war situation was unfavorable, and the enemy was advancing towards the southwest. Repairing or moving the tomb was out of the question.
    After liberation, all the students of the Guilin Normal College, who sympathized with and respected this people's musician, under the mobilization of the Party, also organized a search for the tomb behind Liangshan Well in the direction I had indicated. They marked almost every tomb with chalk, but they couldn't find it. This was of course because I had misremembered the mountain's terrain.
    Two years ago, taking advantage of the inspection by the deputies to the National People's Congress, I made a special visit to this old haunt. Together with comrades from the Guilin Bureau of Culture and Education and the music circles, we went to search for the tomb again, and finally found it at the foot of Baitou Mountain. The situation had changed somewhat over the past ten years. This time, the broken piece of the tombstone found nearby did not have the characters "之墓" (zhi mu, "of the tomb"), but rather the three characters "音乐家" (yin yue jia, "musician"). How many of the dead buried in such a desolate and messy burial ground would be "musicians"? Based on this clue, I quickly found a small tomb beside a flowing spring, overgrown with Vitex negundo. Another broken tombstone stood in front, clearly inscribed with "张曙父女" (Zhang Shu and his daughter), and next to it was "郭沫若题" (Inscribed by Guo Moruo). I finally found my old comrade-in-arms again, and I cried! Who was the thoughtful person who buried this relatively complete piece of the tombstone? I am so grateful!
    Comrade Zhang Shu was born in 1909 in She County, Anhui Province. He had musical talent from a young age. Because his neighbor was a Hui opera troupe, he fell in love with Hui opera and was able to play the Huqin for them on stage at the age of eight. He followed his father to Quzhou, where he finished middle school. His father wanted him to go to a higher education institution in Shanghai to study law and politics so that he could become an official in the future, but for his own interest, he entered the Music Department of Shanghai Art University. When Shanghai Art University was renamed the South China Art Academy, he also entered this academy and became a member of the South China Society. Approaching the revolution, he was arrested twice in a row. When he was imprisoned in Longhua, he was in the same prison with comrades such as Hu Yepin, Rou Shi, Li Weisen, and He Mengxiong. He was very active and gave these fellow prisoners some help, such as trying to send messages to Hu Yepin's family, and he also learned revolutionary principles and some revolutionary songs from them. After his release from prison in 1933, he was admitted to the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, but was ordered to withdraw from the school for participating in the school's strike. He relied entirely on self-study and direct consultation with Su Shilin, Huang Zi, Zhou Shuan, and others.
    Comrade Zhang Shu had many beneficial influences on his classmates and comrades. It can be said that Xian Xinghai's approach to the revolution was largely related to him. He participated in the music group of the Soviet Friendship Association at that time, which was an organization of great significance to the new music movement. Later, he organized the Song Research Society with comrades such as Nie Er, Ren Guang, and Lü Ji. It was at this time that he joined the Communist Party of China. After 1936, at the invitation of his classmates, he taught at Mingde Middle School in Changsha, organized the Zitong Art Society, and launched a mass singing movement to save the nation, which was loved by the masses and young students. However, he was hated and persecuted by Kuomintang cultural agents. During this period, he went to Nanjing and Shanghai three times to participate in the South China Society's drama activities. He wrote many interludes for "Feud," "Flood," "Resurrection," and later for "Lugou Bridge." He also played important roles in "Flood" and "Resurrection."
    In 1937, when the War of Resistance Against Japan broke out, he joined the Third Department of the Political Department in Wuhan. At the same time, he and Xian Xinghai, Lin Lu and other comrades led the mass singing movement in Wuhan, controlling dozens of singing units with more than 5,000 people, which played a huge role in promoting the anti-Japanese sentiment of the broad masses of soldiers and civilians. Comrade Zhang Shu was not only an all-rounder who could write, play, and sing, but he was also extremely good at uniting comrades and had a strong sense of planning in his work. His compositions expressed the enthusiastic feelings of the masses and had a deeper national character. Comrade Lü Ji once analyzed that what new Chinese composers pursued and solved was nothing more than the popularization of emotion and the Sinicization of form, and Comrade Zhang Shu "has made great achievements in both aspects." He also compared Zhang Shu with Nie Er and Xinghai, saying: "His tunes, whether before or after the War of Resistance, have his special style, which is different from both Nie Er and Xinghai, but is full of strong Chinese characteristics." He also said: Nie Er and Xinghai's later works, like Zhang Shu, absorbed nutrients from folk songs, but Nie Er and Xinghai were lively and beautiful, while Zhang Shu "showed a kind of solemn and high-spiritedness."
    Comrade Zhang Shu had always despised the enemy since he joined the revolution. He and Comrades Jin Yan and Liao Mosha defended Mr. Hong Shen and fought against the Da Guangming Cinema, which was showing films that insulted China. He actively participated in the hunger strike movement in Longhua Prison, and was not afraid or succumbed to the enemy's punishment of being handcuffed. He also broke through the surveillance of secret agents and held a mass anti-Japanese concert in Hejian Park in Changsha at that time. When he was in the Third Department of the Political Department in Tanhualin, Wuchang, he rarely hid in air-raid shelters whenever there was an air raid, and often went to the mountains or city walls to cheer for the Soviet volunteer air force fighting the enemy planes. Although his death in Guilin was also related to his adventurousness, his heroic spirit of despising the enemy was always very valuable.
    Comrade Zhang Shu was only twenty-nine years old when he died. He was a red and expert musician who was expected by many. He wrote many songs in his life. When the Third Department left Changsha on December 12, 1938, he hid them in a briefcase, but unfortunately they were burned by a comrade who fled in a hurry in Xiasi, Xiangtan. Later, the remaining manuscripts were all lost in the air-raid shelter when his wife was hiding from the air raids in Chongqing. His experience was so difficult!
    Comrade Zhang Shu has been away from us for a full twenty years. People know Comrade Nie Er, Xinghai and other comrades, but Comrade Zhang Shu, who had influenced them and made contributions to the Party and the people, is rarely mentioned. As his comrades and comrades-in-arms, especially those in the music circles, we should study him more fairly and carefully. We should try our best to collect, sort out, and publish his works, so that his contributions can be correctly evaluated and his spirit can be fully developed.
    Some comrades in the new music circles shed precious blood in the past national democratic struggle. We must cherish this precious blood in order to more effectively support righteousness. The Guilin cultural circles moved the loyal bones of Zhang Shu and his daughter from Baitou Mountain to Qixing Rock on the 23rd of this month, and asked Guo Lao to inscribe another tombstone, and glued the original broken tombstone together and placed it next to the tomb, which is a very meaningful thing. It is said that after Comrade Zhang Shu's tomb was discovered, many music-loving young people have gone there for League Day and held concerts. The dangerous rocks, wild ponds, flowing springs, and sparse reeds in that area, which no one had paid attention to before, have all been awakened by the singing of the young people. Now that they are reburied in Qixing Rock, when tourists linger over the scenery, they will discover the new and old inscriptions by Guo Lao, and they will admire the patriotic musician's loyal and diligent half-life, sympathize with the misfortune of him and his daughter, and thus strive to build the motherland, defend peace, and not let the imperialist fierce front be presumptuous again, and the tragedy will be repeated. The young people will also learn from this musician, draw nourishment from tradition and from the people, not for fame or profit, and raise their art to the ideological and artistic height it deserves to educate the people. Comrade Zhang Shu will also let out a hearty laugh in the ground. In the past under the reactionary rule, Comrade Zhang Shu and his daughter were abandoned in the desolate weeds at the foot of Baitou Mountain, the tombstone was also broken, and no one trimmed the thorns on the tomb. Now the Party and the people have moved him and his daughter to a place of scenic beauty in the world, and they are respected and mourned by thousands of people. Just by comparing the old and new societies, shouldn't Comrade Zhang Shu smile?

    忆张曙
    田汉
    桂林文教局来电，说他们定本月23日迁葬张曙同志，问我们要不要去检视一下，由于忙，我不能去。对着初夏的阵雨，想起前年在桂林白头山下发现张曙父女墓的时候的情景，使人感慨无量。
    张曙同志是1938年2月24日在桂林榕湖旁边的寓所被日机轰炸殉国的。他的长女大大因平日最爱她爸爸，不肯离开他，也一道遇难了。她才只四岁。张曙同志当时在国共合作的军委政治部第三厅六处音乐组工作，死后由三厅把他葬在将军桥凉水井附近的山边，当时三厅厅长郭沫若给他题了一个墓碑，叫“音乐家张曙父女之墓”。我们由长沙回到桂林，曾凭吊过他的墓。但第二次再去的时候，这里起了一个工厂，墓地圈进厂里去了。向工厂打听，说是迁到山的另一面去了。这山很长，曾按照他们说的到山背面去找，几经转折，在一个山窝里发现百来座乱冢，却找不到郭老题的碑。好容易找到一截断碑，只剩“之墓”两个字。但郭老的笔迹就只一个字我也能认识，我终于发现了我的老战友的墓了。当时战局不利，敌人向西南进攻，修墓迁墓都是谈不到的。
    解放之后，同情和敬爱这位人民音乐家的桂林师范学院的全体同学，在党的动员下也曾经按照我说的方向有组织地找过凉山井山后的墓地。他们用粉笔标记了几乎每一座墓冢，但没有寻着。这是当然的，我把山势记错了。
    前年趁全国人民代表大会代表视察之便，我特意访问了这一旧游之地。同桂林文教局和音乐界的同志再去寻墓，终于在白头山下寻到了。十数年来情况有些变化，这次在附近发现的断碑不是“之墓”两字，而是“音乐家”三字。那样荒芜的乱葬岗中能有几个陈死者是“音乐家”呢？由这个线索我很快地找到流泉旁边被黄荆长满了的一座小墓。前面竖着另一断碑分明刻着“张曙父女”，旁边是“郭沫若题”。我终于又找着我的老战友了，我哭了！是哪一位有心人给他埋下这截较完整的断碑呢？太可感谢了！
    张曙同志，1909年生，安徽歙县人。他从小就有音乐才能，因邻居是徽戏班，他便爱上了徽戏，八岁上就能登台给他们拉胡琴。他随他父亲到衢州，在那里读完中学，他父亲让他到上海进高等学校，原是要他学法政的，将来好做官，但他为自己的兴趣，入了上海艺术大学音乐系。上海艺大改为南国艺术学院，他也入了这个学院，并且成为南国社的社员。接近革命，他一连两次被捕。当他囚在龙华的时候，与胡也频、柔石、李伟森、何梦熊等同志同狱。他很活跃，曾给这些难友们一些帮助，如曾设法给胡也频传信给家属等等，也从他们学习了革命的道理和一些革命歌曲。1933年出狱后他考入上海音乐专科学校，因参加该校的罢学风潮，被勒令退学。他就完全靠自学和直接跟苏石林、黄自、周淑安诸位请教了。
    张曙同志给他的同学们和同志们许多有益的影响。冼星海同志的接近革命应该说是跟他有很大关系。他参加过当时苏联之友社的音乐组，这是对于新音乐运动一个有重大意义的组织。后来他又与聂耳、任光、吕骥诸同志组织歌曲研究社。就在这个时候他加入了中国共产党。1936年以后他曾应他的同学之请在长沙明德中学任教，组织梓桐艺术社，展开救亡群众歌咏运动，被群众和青年学生所热爱。但却被国民党文化特务仇视、迫害。其间他曾三次到南京上海参加南国社话剧活动。他为“械斗”、为“洪水”、为“复活”以及后来为“芦沟桥”写了许多插曲。他也在“洪水”，“复活”诸剧中演过重要角色。
    1937年抗日战争爆发，他参加武汉政治部三厅。也同时和冼星海、林路等同志领导全武汉群众歌咏运动，掌握数十个歌咏单位，人数达五千以上，对于鼓吹广大军民抗战情绪起了巨大作用。张曙同志不止是能写、能拉、能唱的全才，他又极能团结同志，工作计划性强，他的作曲既表现了群众的热烈感情，又有较深厚的民族特色。吕骥同志曾经分析说：中国新作曲家所追求解决的不外感情的大众化和形式的中国化，张曙同志“在这两方面都做了很大的成绩”。他又把张曙和聂耳、星海相比，说：“他的曲调无论在抗战以前或以后，都有他特殊的风格，既不同于聂耳，也不同于星海，然而是富有浓厚的中国色彩”。又说：聂耳、星海的后期作品，虽则和张曙一样，都从民歌中吸取了养分，但聂耳、星海活泼秀丽，而张曙“却显出一种沉雄高昂的气概”。
    张曙同志从他参加革命起是一贯鄙视敌人的，他曾和金焰、廖沫沙同志保卫洪深先生打过演映侮辱中国的影片的大光明影院；他在龙华监狱中积极参加罢饭运动，虽被敌人处以反铐之刑，也毫不畏惧和屈服。他又曾突破特务监视，在当时长沙何键公园举行群众反日演唱。在武昌昙花林政治部三厅的时候每遇警报，他很少躲防空洞，常常到山上或城墙上为与敌机战斗的苏联志愿空军喝彩。虽则他在桂林之死也跟他这种冒险主义的缺点有关，但他鄙视敌人的豪迈气概始终是十分可贵的。
    张曙同志死的时候才二十九岁。他是被许多人属望的一位又红又专的音乐家。他生平写了许多曲子，1938年12月12日三厅离长沙时他把它藏在公文箱里，不幸在湘潭下摄司被仓皇逃难的某同志烧掉了。其后剩下的藏稿，他的夫人在重庆躲警报时又全部在防空洞里遗失了。他的遭遇正是这样的多艰！
    张曙同志离开我们已经整整二十年了。人们知道聂耳、星海等同志而对于给过他们影响和对党对人民有过贡献的张曙同志却很少被提起。作为他的同志和战友的我们，特别是音乐界同志们，应该更公正更细致地研究他。尽量搜集、整理、出版他的作品，让他的贡献得到正确估价，让他的精神得到充分发扬。
    新音乐界一些同志在过去民族民主斗争中是流过宝贵的血的。必需珍爱这些宝贵的血才能更有效地扶植正气。桂林文化界本月23日把张曙父女的忠骨从白头山移到七星岩，并请郭老题了另一个墓碑，而把原来已经破碎了的墓碑粘合起来，搁在墓旁，这是十分有意义的事。当张曙同志墓被发现后，据说已经有许多爱好音乐的青年们到那里去过团日，开歌唱会，那一带的危岩野塘，流泉疏苇，原来没有人理睬过的，被青年们的歌声都给惊醒了。于今迁葬在七星岩，游人们留连风景之际，发现郭老提的新旧碑文，更会景仰这位爱国音乐家忠勤的半生，同情他父女的不幸，因而努力建设祖国，保卫和平，不让帝国主义凶锋再逞，悲剧重演；青年们也更会学这位音乐家一样，从传统、从民间吸取养料，不图名，不图利，把自己艺术提到应有的思想和艺术高度来教育人民。张曙同志在地下也将会发出爽朗的笑声吧。在过去反动统治下，张曙同志父女被抛置在白头山下的荒烟蔓草中，墓碑也被打碎了，墓上的荆棘也没有人剪葺，于今党和人民把他父女移在甲天下的山水胜处，受万人尊仰凭吊，单凭这新旧社会的对比，张曙同志不应该展颜一笑吗？
