Respected Comrade Chen Shutong! Dear comrades and friends!

We are extremely honored to have the opportunity to pay a friendly visit to the fraternal People's Republic of China.

On behalf of our People's Delegation, I would like to express our heartfelt thanks for your warm welcome, and through you, extend our fraternal greetings to all the citizens of Beijing.

During the most difficult period of our Korean people, the Chinese people provided long-term protection and nurturing for the children of our patriotic martyrs and war orphans. Our Korean People's Delegation has come to your country to convey to the Chinese people the greatest gratitude expressed by the Korean Workers' Party, the Republic Government, and the Korean people for this.

We would like to convey the highest respect and greatest gratitude from the Korean Workers' Party, the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and the entire Korean people to the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, headed by Chairman Mao Zedong, for their sincere support and assistance to our Korean people.

The friendly and cooperative relationship between our two peoples, forged through a long history, has been further consolidated and developed in the struggle against the common enemy—Japanese imperialism, in repelling the US imperialist aggression against Korea, and in the common struggle to safeguard peace and socialism.

The full support expressed by the Government of the People's Republic of China for the February 5th statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, have opened up a new situation for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, which is a great contribution to maintaining and consolidating peace in the Far East and the world.

The Korean people are pleased to regard the brilliant achievements in socialist construction made by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong as their own achievements, and wish the Chinese people even greater achievements in promoting the prosperity and development of socialist China.

Today, the entire Korean people are united as one with steel-like solidarity around the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic Government headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, and are achieving brilliant victories in the struggle to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland and socialist construction.

The peoples of Korea and China, closely united in the big family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, have made great achievements in socialist construction. In our common great cause, the peoples of Korea and China will always be together and will gloriously defend the eastern outpost of the socialist camp.

Dear Comrade Chen Shutong!

Dear comrades and friends!

The Korean people believe that friendship and unity with the Chinese people is a great strength for our Korean people; the Korean people are infinitely proud to have such sincere friends as the Chinese people.

The Chinese people not only aided the Korean people with blood in the great Fatherland Liberation War against the American aggressors, but also rescued our war orphans and nurtured them like their own children.

The war orphans, who lost their parents due to the inhuman and barbaric atrocities of the American beasts, were still young and ignorant when they first stepped into your country. However, thanks to the sincere efforts and parental care of the Chinese people, they have grown up healthily and have been cultivated into excellent young people.

Here, we would like to once again express our warm gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people who have painstakingly nurtured the children of our many patriotic martyrs and war orphans.

We will take this opportunity of visiting your country to learn from all aspects of the great achievements and valuable experiences of the Chinese people in socialist construction.

We are confident that our visit to your country will contribute to further strengthening the traditional friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and unity between the peoples of Korea and China!

Long live the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    许贞琡团长的讲话尊敬的陈叔通同志！亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    我们为了有机会来兄弟般的中华人民共和国作友好访问，而感到极大的荣幸。
    我以我们人民代表团的名义，衷心地感谢你们如此热烈地欢迎我们，并且通过你们，谨向全体北京市民致以兄弟般的问候。
    在我们朝鲜人民最艰苦的时期，中国人民为我们长期地保护和养育了我们的爱国烈士的子女和战争孤儿。我们朝鲜人民代表团就是为了向中国人民转达朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府与朝鲜人民对此所表示的最大谢意而来贵国访问的。
    我们谨向诚心诚意地支持和援助我们朝鲜人民的以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，转达朝鲜劳动党、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和全体朝鲜人民的最崇高的敬意和最大的感谢。
    我们两国人民通过悠久的历史所结成的友好合作关系，在反对共同的敌人——日本帝国主义的斗争中，在击退美帝国主义对朝鲜的侵略和维护和平与社会主义的共同斗争中，得到了进一步的巩固和发展。
    中华人民共和国政府对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府2月5日声明所表明的全面支持，和中国人民志愿军的撤离朝鲜，为朝鲜问题的和平解决打开了新的局面，这对维护和巩固远东和世界和平，是有巨大贡献的。
    朝鲜人民，把中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党的领导下所取得的社会主义建设上的辉煌成就，当做自己的成就而高兴，并且祝福中国人民在促进社会主义中国的繁荣发展上，获得更巨大的成就。
    今天，全体朝鲜人民钢铁般地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党中央委员会和共和国政府的周围，在促进祖国的和平统一和社会主义建设的斗争中，正在取得光辉的胜利。
    朝中两国人民，紧紧地团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭里，在社会主义建设中都取得了伟大的成就。在我们共同的伟大事业中，朝中两国人民将永远在一起，将光荣地捍卫社会主义阵营的东方前哨。
    亲爱的陈叔通同志！
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    朝鲜人民认为，同中国人民的友谊团结，便是我们朝鲜人民的巨大力量；朝鲜人民，为了有中国人民这样真挚的朋友而感到无限的骄傲。
    中国人民，不仅用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民为了反对美国侵略者而进行的伟大的祖国解放战争，而且拯救出我们的战争孤儿，像自己的亲生子女一样地养育了他们。
    由于美国野兽的惨无人道的野蛮暴行而失去了父母的战争孤儿，在刚刚踏进贵国的时候，还都是不太懂事的小孩子。但是，由于中国人民的真诚的努力和亲骨肉般的关怀，他们已经健康地成长起来，被培养成了优秀的青少年。
    在这里，我们谨向费尽心血养育了我们众多的爱国烈士的子女和战争孤儿的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，再一次表示热烈的感谢。
    我们借这访问贵国的机会，将要从各方面学习中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的伟大成就和宝贵的经验。
    我们确信，我们在贵国的访问，在进一步加强朝中两国人民的传统的友谊团结上，将会作出贡献。
    朝中两国人民之间牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
