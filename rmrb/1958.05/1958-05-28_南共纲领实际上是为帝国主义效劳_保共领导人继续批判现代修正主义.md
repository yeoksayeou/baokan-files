Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 26th: Bulgarian Communist leaders recently criticized the revisionism of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at summary and re-election meetings of Party organizations held in various states.

    Staikov, a member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said at the summary and re-election meeting of the Party organization in the Tirnovo region: In the struggle against socialist countries, American imperialists attach particular importance to the ideological front. Especially after the failure of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary, the imperialist aggressors tried every possible means to create ideological confusion among us. In this regard, American imperialists place special hope on the Yugoslav revisionists.

    Staikov said that everyone knows how socialist countries have strived to normalize relations with Yugoslavia in the past five years. Our country has rescinded the incorrect accusations in the 1949 Cominform resolution. However, the Yugoslav leaders did not draw the necessary conclusions about themselves from the 1948 Cominform resolution, which correctly pointed out that they deviated from the Marxist-Leninist stance and stood on the nationalist stance on many issues. Everyone remembers that, according to the Belgrade Declaration and the subsequent Moscow Declaration, we stopped criticizing the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in the press. All socialist countries have strictly adhered to this. However, the Yugoslav side did not do so. During this period, the Yugoslav press continuously published articles against this or that of our parties—rudely interfering in their internal affairs. Everyone also remembers Tito's speech in Pula in 1956. This speech was published precisely during the rampant Hungarian counter-revolutionary rebellion. From this speech, one can see the arguments that were later written into the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. The League of Communists of Yugoslavia also refused to sign the Declaration of Twelve Communist and Workers' Parties, which is a document of great significance for the entire international workers' movement. In the spirit of opposing the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties in November 1957, the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are preparing for the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and they want to turn this congress into a kind of center of the international workers' movement, making it opposed to the Moscow Conference. The speeches by Tito, Kardelj, and Ranković at the congress were entirely against the unity of the Soviet Union and the international workers' movement.

    Stoyanov, an alternate member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said in the Haskovo region that, with the help of modern revisionism in the workers' movement and the communist movement, imperialism is attempting to split the socialist camp countries, especially to alienate the relations between the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries and other communist and workers' parties. Now, these attempts by imperialists rely on the resolutions and programs adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. These resolutions and programs thoroughly expose their drafters as incorrigible revisionists.

    Taskov, a member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said at the summary and re-election meeting of the Party organization in the Blagoevgrad region on the 19th: The development of relations with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia shows that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have fallen into the abyss of bourgeois nationalism, deviated from the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, and embarked on a path that is harmful to the international workers' movement and the Yugoslav people. Because of this, they have been criticized by all fraternal communist and workers' parties. We will not make any compromises with the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on matters of principle and will insist on the purity of Marxist-Leninist doctrine to the end.

    Mikhailov, a member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party, said in the Pleven region on the 16th when talking about the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia that it is an opportunist and revisionist program. The tone and manner in which the congress discussed the program were intolerable. At the same time, the congress also made unfounded and intolerable accusations against the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and therefore the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have been praised by imperialists. The Yugoslav Communist Program actually serves the imperialists.

    Zankov, a member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party, participated in the summary and re-election meetings of the state Party organization in Stara Zagora on the 20th and 21st. In his speech at the meeting, when criticizing the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, he said that modern revisionism has found the most distinct and concentrated expression in the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Not only in the program, but also in the reports of Tito, Kardelj, and Ranković, there were also wrong and slanderous attacks on the Soviet Union, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other fraternal communist and workers' parties. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is nothing but a total betrayal and revision of Marxism-Leninism. It is not the first time that the world communist movement has encountered traitors to Marxism. The memory of the unfortunate fate of the opportunists and revisionists of the Second International is still fresh. The same fate awaits the current and future revisionists.

    Bulgarian Communist Party Politburo member Bulgaranov, alternate Politburo member Dimov, and Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee Secretaries Dimitrov and Todorov also severely criticized the revisionism of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at the summary and re-election meetings of Party organizations in various states.

### 南共纲领实际上是为帝国主义效劳  保共领导人继续批判现代修正主义

    南共纲领实际上是为帝国主义效劳
    保共领导人继续批判现代修正主义
    新华社索非亚26日电　保加利亚共产党领导人最近在各州举行的党组织总结改选会议上批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的修正主义。
    保共中央政治局委员斯塔伊科夫在第尔诺沃州党组织总结改选会议上说：美帝国主义者在反对社会主义国家的斗争中特别重视思想战线。尤其在匈牙利反革命叛乱失败以后，帝国主义侵略者千方百计企图在我们当中引起思想混乱。在这方面，美帝国主义者对南斯拉夫修正主义者寄以特别的希望。
    斯塔伊科夫说，大家都知道，最近五年来社会主义国家努力同南斯拉夫关系正常化的情况如何。我们国家取消了1949年情报局决议里不正确的责难。但是南斯拉夫领导人并未从1948年情报局决议中得出关于自己的应有的结论，决议中正确地指出他们脱离马克思列宁主义立场，在许多问题上站在民族主义立场。大家都记得，根据贝尔格莱德宣言以及以后的莫斯科宣言，我们在报刊上停止批评南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟。所有社会主义国家都严格地遵守了这一点。但是南斯拉夫方面并没有这样作，在这段期间内，南斯拉夫报刊不断发表反对我们这个党或那个党的文章——粗暴地干涉它们的内部生活。大家还记得1956年铁托在普拉的演说。这篇演说正是发表在匈牙利反革命叛乱猖獗时期。从这篇演说里可以看到后来写在南共纲领草案里的那些论点。南共还拒绝在十二国共产党和工人党宣言上签字，而这个宣言对整个国际工人运动是个有巨大意义的文件。南共领导人在同1957年11月莫斯科各国共产党和工人党会议相对立的精神下，准备南共第七次代表大会，他们要把这次代表大会变成国际工人运动的某种中心，使它和莫斯科会议相对立。铁托、卡德尔和兰科维奇在代表大会上的讲话整个是反对苏联和国际工人运动的团结。
    保共中央政治局候补委员斯托扬诺夫在哈斯科沃州说，帝国主义在工人运动和共产主义运动中的现代修正主义帮助下，企图分裂社会主义阵营国家，特别是企图离间苏联、苏联共产党同其他社会主义国家和其他共产党和工人党间的关系。现在帝国主义者的这些企图是依靠南共第七次代表大会通过的决议和纲领，这些决议和纲领彻底揭穿了它们的起草者是不可救药的修正主义者。
    保共中央政治局委员塔斯科夫19日在布拉戈耶夫格勒州党组织总结改选会议上说：同南共关系的发展表明，南共领导人已陷入资产阶级民族主义的深渊，脱离了马克思列宁主义基本原则，走上了对国际工人运动和南斯拉夫人民有害的道路。正因为这样，他们受到所有兄弟共产党和工人党的批判。在原则问题上我们不同南共领导人作任何妥协，将为马克思列宁主义学说的纯洁性坚持到底。
    保共中央政治局委员米哈伊洛夫16日在普勒文州谈到南共纲领时说，这是机会主义的、修正主义的纲领。代表大会讨论纲领的语调和方式是不能容忍的。代表大会同时还对苏联和其他社会主义国家进行了无根据的和不能容忍的责难，因而南共领导人受到帝国主义的赞扬。南共纲领实际上是为帝国主义者效劳。
    保共中央政治局委员赞科夫20日和21日参加了斯塔拉萨哥拉城的州党组织的总结改选会议。他在会上发言时批评南共纲领时说，现代修正主义在南共七大所通过的纲领中找到了最鲜明和最集中的表现。不仅在纲领中，而且在铁托、卡德尔和兰科维奇的报告中对苏联、苏联共产党、其他兄弟共产党和工人党也作了错误的和诬蔑的攻击。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领不外是对于马克思列宁主义的总背离和修正。世界共产主义运动碰到马克思主义的叛徒已经不是第一次了。对于第二国际的机会主义者和修正主义者不幸命运的记忆犹新。同样的命运也等待着现在的和将来的修正主义者。
    保共中央政治局委员布尔加拉诺夫、政治局候补委员迪莫夫、保共中央书记季米特洛夫和托多罗夫也先后在各州党组织总结改选会议上严正地批判了南共的修正主义。
