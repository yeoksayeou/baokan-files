Overcoming Generalized Leadership Methods to Reverse Extensive Farming Habits
　　Jilin Establishes High-Yield Fields in Production Teams
　　Baicheng Prefectural Committee Production Inspection Team Participates in Production to Promote Spring Planting
　　This newspaper reports that the movement to establish ten hectares of high-yield fields in each production team in Jilin Province is developing vigorously. This movement was initiated by the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the provincial conference of advanced agricultural producers in February of this year. Its content is to call on each of the province's production teams to establish a ten-hectare high-yield field that exceeds the Yellow River in dry land yield and the Yangtze River in paddy field yield, in order to drive the increase in yield of general fields. This is a strategic measure for Jilin Province to achieve its grain production increase plan. At present, most of the 100,000 production teams in more than 7,000 agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have established high-yield fields based on local conditions, and dry land has been sown ahead of schedule. The planned yield of these high-yield fields is generally 7,500 jin to over 10,000 jin per hectare. According to statistics from five counties including Yushu, Dehui, Jiaohe, Hailong, and Dongfeng, the area of high-yield fields accounts for about 20% of the total cultivated area, but the planned yield can reach more than 30% of the total planned grain output of each county. In Dongliao County, high-yield fields account for 19% of the county's cultivated area, but the planned grain yield can reach 37% of the county's planned grain output. Eleven counties and cities in the Gongzhuling Special Zone estimate that high-yield fields account for about 10% of the total cultivated area, but the planned grain yield can reach 20% to 25% of the total planned output of the special zone. Therefore, the development of this movement will be a powerful move for Jilin Province to achieve a great leap forward in agriculture this year.
　　The promotion of these high-yield fields first clarified its significance through farmers' airing of views and debates, and then determined the plots, yields, and measures to achieve high yields through the masses. Therefore, these high-yield fields not only take the lead in planting high-yield crops such as corn, sorghum, millet, and rice according to national plans, but also concentrate the reliable yield-increasing measures and advanced experiences that have been practiced locally over the years in farming.
　　The agricultural leadership departments of Jilin Province believe that the development of the high-yield field movement is very beneficial to overcoming the generalized style of agricultural leadership in the province. It can effectively prevent leadership methods that only make general calls, make it easier to create experience, set examples, break conservative ideas, encourage mass enthusiasm, and complete this year's grain production increase targets; and lay a good foundation for reversing the historical habit of extensive farming among farmers in the province.

　　This newspaper reports that the Spring Ploughing Inspection Team of the Baicheng Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party of China uses the method of careful accounting, tapping potential, and formulating small-scale agricultural plans to specifically help agricultural cooperatives solve the problems of spring ploughing and sowing. When this inspection team recently inspected spring ploughing and sowing in the Patriotic Agricultural Cooperative in Taonan County, they first went to the fields to participate in production. The problems they found in their labor were that some teams were slow in spring sowing, some technical measures were backward, and some teams sowed millet unevenly.
　　The inspection team first went deep into three production teams, coordinated with cooperative and team cadres, organized old farmers and commune members to recall the lessons of yield reduction due to late planting in the past, and helped commune members improve their understanding. Then, they helped these teams calculate three accounts: time, tasks, and labor, and formulated small-scale agricultural plans. After tapping potential and increasing plows, each production team was able to finish planting around May 10.
　　The inspection team also studied sowing techniques with commune members through field meetings, summarized experiences on the spot, and promoted them on the spot. When the inspection team saw in the third production team that they were using wooden manure funnels instead of manual manure filtering, which greatly improved sowing efficiency, they immediately promoted it.

　　克服一般化领导方法扭转耕作粗放习惯
    吉林建立生产队高产田
    白城地委生产检查组参加生产推动春播
    本报讯　吉林省每个生产队建立十公顷高产田的运动，正在蓬勃发展。这个运动，是中共吉林省委在今年2月间全省农业先进生产者代表会议上发起的。它的内容是号召全省每个生产队建立一块旱田产量过黄河、水田产量过长江的十公顷高产田，以带动一般田地增产。这是吉林省实现粮食增产规划的战略性的措施。目前，全省七千多农业社的十万个生产队中，大部分都因地制宜地建立了高产田，而且旱田已提前播种完毕。这些高产田的计划产量，一般是每公顷七千五百斤到一万斤以上。据榆树、德惠、蛟河、海龙、东丰等五县统计，高产田的面积约占总耕地面积的20％左右，计划产量却可以达到各县粮食计划总产量的30％以上。东辽县的高产田，占全县耕地面积的19％，但粮食计划产量可达到全县粮食计划产量的37％。公主岭专区十一个县市估计：高产田约占总耕地面积10％，但粮食计划产量却可达到这个专区计划总产量的20％至25％。因此，这个运动的发展，将是吉林省今年实现农业大翻身的有力一着。
    这些高产田的推行，首先通过农民的鸣放辩论，弄清了它的意义，然后再通过群众确定了地段、产量和实现高产的措施。因此，这些高产田不仅带头按照国家计划种植玉米、高粱、谷子、水稻等高产作物，而且在耕作上集中了当地历年来行之可靠的增产措施和先进经验。
    吉林省农业领导部门认为：高产田运动的发展，对克服本省农业领导一般化的作风大有好处。它可以有效地防止只作一般号召的领导方法，更便于创造经验，树立榜样，打破保守思想，鼓舞群众干劲，完成今年粮食增产指标；为扭转本省农民耕作粗放的历史习惯打好基础。

    本报讯　中共吉林省白城地委春耕检查组用算细账、挖潜力、制订小段农事计划的办法，具体帮助农业社解决春耕播种的问题。这个检查组最近在洮南县爱国农业社检查春耕播种时，首先到田间参加生产。他们在劳动中发现的问题是有的队春播迟缓，有的技术措施落后，有的队下种谷子点的不匀。
    检查组首先深入到三个生产队，协同社、队干部，组织老农和社员回忆了过去晚种减产的教训，帮助社员提高了认识。然后帮助这些队算了时间、活计、劳力三笔账，制订出小段农事计划。经过挖潜力，增加犁杖，各个生产队都能在5月10日左右种完地。
    检查组还通过地头会和社员们研究了播种技术，就地总结经验，就地推广。检查组在第三生产队看到他们运用木制粪漏斗代替人工滤粪，大大提高了播种效率的先进办法后，立即进行推广。　（蔡明）
