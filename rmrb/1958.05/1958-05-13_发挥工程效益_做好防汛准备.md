Xinhua News Agency, May 12th: The person in charge of the Ministry of Agriculture pointed out at the National Farmland Irrigation Telephone Conference held on the evening of the 11th that the main tasks of farmland irrigation work in various regions are to make every effort to leverage the benefits of engineering on the basis of regular construction, and at the same time to do a good job in flood prevention preparation, and strive for the safe passage of all water conservancy projects through the flood season.

Currently, it is a tense season for irrigation water in rural areas, and some places are experiencing drought. The Ministry of Agriculture requires all regions to rely on the masses to find every possible way to increase sources of income and reduce expenditure, and strive to fully leverage the benefits of engineering. At the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture also introduced various methods of increasing income and reducing expenditure, as well as scientific water use. In order to fully leverage the benefits of engineering, the Ministry of Agriculture also requires all regions to rely on the masses to rush to manufacture simple water lifting tools in large quantities, and to propose advanced indicators of the benefiting area per horsepower for existing power-driven water lifting machinery.

At present, some regions have entered the flood season, and some regions are about to enter the flood season. The Ministry of Agriculture pointed out that many new projects have been built in various regions this year, so it is necessary to do a good job in the protection and preparation of existing projects, strengthen organizational leadership, and strive for the safe passage of all water conservancy projects through the flood season. It also requires all regions to seize the time to inspect the quality of the projects, repair what needs to be repaired immediately, and resolutely rework what needs to be reworked. Those that can be completed before the flood season should concentrate their efforts to complete them. Those that cannot be completed must have temporary flood control measures. Regardless of new or old projects, flood control organizations must be established, and hydrological forecasting and mass flood season observation work must be strengthened, striving to achieve "every commune sets up a station, and everyone observes." He Jili, Vice Minister of Agriculture, also specifically reminded all regions at this telephone conference to overcome complacency and not to relax their vigilance against flood prevention and flood control because they have done some water storage and soil conservation projects.

　　发挥工程效益　做好防汛准备
    据新华社12日讯　农业部负责人在11日晚召开的全国农田水利电话会议上指出，当前各地农田水利工作的主要任务是，在常年施工的基础上千方百计发挥工程效益，同时做好防汛准备工作，力求各项水利工程安全渡过汛期。
    目前正是农村灌溉用水的紧张季节，有的地方正在抗旱。农业部要求各地，依靠群众千方百计开源节流，力争充分发挥工程效益。在这个会上，农业部还介绍多种开源节流和科学用水的办法。为了充分发挥工程效益，农业部还要求各地，依靠群众大量赶制简易提水工具，并对已有的动力提水机械，提出每马力受益面积的先进指标。
    目前有的地区已进入汛期，有的地区汛期即将到来。农业部指出，今年各地新修工程很多，做好现有工程的防护准备工作，加强组织领导，力争各项水利工程安全渡过汛期。并要求各地，目前对工程质量抓紧检查，该修的立即补修，该返工的坚决返工，汛期前能完工的，集中力量突击完成，不能完工的必须有临时防汛措施；无论新老工程都要建立防汛组织，加强水文预报和群众性的汛期观测工作，争取做到“社社设站，人人观测”。农业部副部长何基澧在这次电话会议上，还特别提醒各地要克服麻痹思想，不能因做了一些蓄水和水土保持工程而放松了对防汛防洪的警惕。
