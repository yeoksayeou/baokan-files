　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th: According to TASS, Soviet polar explorer Treshnikov said that the work done by the Soviet expedition in studying the Antarctic ice sheet far exceeded that of all other countries. The Soviet Antarctic expedition's aircraft overcame unprecedented difficulties in the history of world aviation in Antarctica, and never failed to complete its flight missions. He said that Soviet scientists have a very clear understanding of the structure of the Antarctic ice sheet and have created new methods for calculating ice sheet temperatures. The total depth of ice sheet drilling reached 2,500 meters, with a maximum drilling record of 371 meters for each well, which is 57 meters more than the maximum drilling depth of the United States. Treshnikov said that air transport played an important role in the Antarctic exploration work. Neither strong winds, severe cold, nor frequent changes in ice terrain could stop the Soviet Antarctic flying heroes.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 12th: According to the Soviet "Labor News," the Soviet Antarctic expedition's diesel-electric ship "Ob" visited Easter Island (i.e., Pasqua Island), the famous mysterious island in the South Pacific, on the 8th. This is the first Soviet ship to visit this island.
　　This location, considered the "mystery" of world archaeology, is not far from South America, under Chilean jurisdiction, with an area of only 118 square kilometers. It is currently inhabited by 900 indigenous people of Polynesian descent and dozens of Chileans.
　　The Soviet expedition members went ashore for a visit. They toured the famous Rano Raraku volcano by car. The crater has become a small lake, and there are many stone statues of human heads inside and outside the crater, with serious expressions and long ears. Some ruins of houses still remain on the volcano.

　　苏联南极考察成绩卓著
　　“鄂毕号”考察船访问南美的神秘小岛
    据新华社12日讯　据塔斯社消息：苏联极地考察家特列什尼科夫说，苏联考察队在研究南极冰层方面所做的工作远远超过了一切其他国家。苏联南极考察队的飞机在南极克服了世界航空史上空前的困难，没有一次不完成自己的飞行任务。他说，苏联科学家对南极冰层的构造已有一个很明确的了解，并且创造了计算冰层温度的新方法。冰层凿井的掘进总深度达二千五百公尺，每个凿井掘进的最高纪录达三百七十一公尺，比美国凿井的最大深度要多五十七公尺。特列什尼科夫说，航空运输在南极考察工作中起了重要作用。无论是大风、严寒、冰层地形的经常变化等都阻拦不了苏联南极飞行英雄。
    据新华社莫斯科12日电　据苏联“劳动报”报道，苏联南极考察队“鄂毕号”柴油电动船于8日访问了南太平洋著名的神秘小岛——复活节岛（即帕斯库阿岛）。这是访问这个岛屿的第一艘苏联轮船。
    这个被认为是世界考古学之“谜”的所在地，离南美洲不远，属智利管辖，面积仅有一百一十八平方公里，现住有属于玻里尼西亚族的土著居民九百人和几十个智利人。
    苏联考察队员们上岛参观。他们坐汽车参观了有名的兰诺拉拉克火山。火山口已变成一个小湖，火山口内外有很多石雕人头像，表情严肃，耳朵很长。火山上还残存着一些房屋的遗址。
