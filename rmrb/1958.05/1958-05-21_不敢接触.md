　　Nixon, the US Vice President who was just booed back to Washington by the people of Latin America, offered a suggestion in a "secret report" to Eisenhower. He believed that "American diplomats should increase their contact with students, trade union leaders, faculty, and intellectuals."

　　Nixon's suggestion makes it seem as though he really improved his "talent" after being beaten, and he doesn't hesitate to use his personal experience to admonish American diplomatic officials, so as to avoid repeatedly embarrassing themselves.

　　People remember that there was a "turning point" in Nixon's Latin American trip regarding the issue of "contact". After being beaten painfully by students in Peru, he himself made the decision at the time to no longer "contact" students and worker leaders. Now he wants other American diplomatic officials to do what he doesn't dare to do.

　　In a word, Nixon is still making a big deal out of the "contact" issue today, but he does not dare to contact the real problem – the failure of the American imperialist policy in Latin America.

### 不敢接触

    不敢接触
    刚刚被拉丁美洲人民轰回华盛顿的美国副总统尼克松，在给艾森豪威尔的一项“秘密报告”中献了一计，他认为，“美国外交家应该增加他们和学生、工会领袖、教员以及知识分子的接触”。
    尼克松如此献策好像在挨揍以后真的提高了“才干”了，不惜用他的亲身经历来训诫美国外交官员，免得一再丢人出丑。
    人们记得，尼克松拉丁美洲之行中有一个关于“接触”问题的“转折点”，在秘鲁被学生痛击之后，他本人当时即作出决定，不再同学生和工人领袖“接触”。现在他却要其他美国外交官员做他不敢做的事了。
    一句话，尼克松今天还在“接触”问题上大做文章，但是他却不敢接触真正的问题——美国帝国主义政策在拉丁美洲的失败。
