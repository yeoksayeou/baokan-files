	"Huaihai" is a Coal Sea
	(Our report) This paper reports that the famous Huaihai battlefields during the Liberation War – the areas of Su County, Suixi and Mengcheng in Anhui Province – will become a new coal industrial base for our country. Since 1955, the 120 Exploration Team of the Ministry of Coal Industry has prospected a vast coal sea, extending more than fifty kilometers from north to south and about ten kilometers from east to west, with a total area of about 250 square kilometers, south of the Longhai Railway, west of the Jinpu Railway, and south of Su County in Anhui and Yongcheng in Henan. There are eight or nine coal seams here, the thickest being up to seven meters thick, with a preliminary estimated reserve of about two billion tons. The quality of the coal is also very good, with coking coal, power coal, and lean coal being the most abundant, and smokeless coal for civilian use is also very abundant.
	The Lieshan inclined shaft, which started construction on this coal field last October, has already advanced more than two hundred meters. Another pair of Lieshan vertical shafts has also broken ground. This coal field is close to the Jinpu Railway and the Longhai Railway, with convenient transportation and great prospects for development.

　　“淮海”是个煤海
    本报讯　解放战争中著名的淮海战役战场——安徽宿县、濉溪、蒙城地区，将成为我国一个新的煤炭工业基地。1955年以来，煤炭工业部一二○勘探队，在陇海路以南、津浦路以西、安徽宿县、河南永城以南一带，探明南北五十多公里，东西约十公里，全部面积约二百五十平方公里的巨大煤海。这里的煤层有八、九层，最厚达七公尺，初步估计储藏量约二十亿吨左右。煤的质量也很好，炼焦、动力、瘦煤最多，民用的无烟煤也非常丰富。
    在这个煤田上去年10月开工的烈山斜井，已经进尺二百多公尺。又一对烈山竖井也已破土开工。这个煤田靠近津浦铁路和陇海铁路，交通便利，发展前途是很大的。
