Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 27th: The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry recently decided to establish an organization called the "Asian Economic Research Institute" to serve the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of economic expansion into Southeast Asia.

It is reported that the purpose of the Kishi Nobusuke government allocating 30 million yen to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry to establish this research center is to collect economic intelligence from Southeast Asian countries in all aspects, such as "local customs," resource conditions, and market trends, in order to implement "concrete economic cooperation" with these countries.

After the war, Japan has been intensifying its economic expansion through overseas investment. The white paper on Japan's "economic cooperation" with other countries, recently published by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, stated that Japan's annual overseas investment in the 1956 fiscal year had increased from 2.9 million US dollars in the 1951 fiscal year to 18 million US dollars, an increase of approximately five times.

The "White Paper" also stated that in order to expand Japan's "economic cooperation" with some countries, the Kishi Nobusuke government is also preparing to open an "Overseas Technology Center" in India, establish "Technical Consulting Centers" in six locations in Southeast Asia and Central and South America, establish a "Fertilizer Center" in Bangkok, and an "Agricultural Machinery Center" in Yangon this year.

    岸信介政府成立新的经济机构
    加紧向亚洲进行经济扩张
    据新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本通商产业省最近决定成立一个叫做“亚洲经济研究所”的组织，为岸信介政府向东南亚进行经济扩张的政策服务。
    据报道，岸信介政府拨给通商产业省三千万日元成立这个调查中心的目的，是为了搜集东南亚国家的“当地民情”、资源情况以及市场动向等各方面的经济情报，以便同这些国家实行“具体的经济合作”。
    战后，日本一直加紧通过海外投资方式进行经济扩张。不久以前通商产业省发表的日本和其他国家进行“经济合作”的白皮书说，1956财政年度日本的年度海外投资额已经从1951年度的二百九十万美元增加到一千八百万美元，即大约增加了五倍。
    这项“白皮书”还说，为了扩大日本同一些国家的“经济合作”，岸信介政府今年还准备在印度开办一个“海外技术中心”，在东南亚和中南美六个地方建立“技术谘询中心”，在曼谷设立一个“肥料中心”，在仰光设立一个“农业机器中心”。
