Along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production nationwide, a surging and vigorous cultural upsurge is also beginning, including a great leap forward in culture and art. Its main manifestations are: a large number of cultural and art workers going to factories and the countryside, going deep among workers and peasants, living and working with them; art troupes and a large number of art workers creating and performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers with great enthusiasm, and the number of creations reflecting real life and struggle has increased dramatically; mass cultural and artistic activities are unprecedentedly active, and mass creations are unprecedentedly prosperous. In many areas, there are poems everywhere, murals everywhere, and songs everywhere, creating a new situation that is typical of a great revolutionary era: songs everywhere, magnificent and healthy, and inspiring.

Socialist culture and art are an integral part of socialist construction, developing along with the development of the economic base and in turn serving the economic base. The main task of socialist culture and art is to conduct socialist ideological education for the people through culture and art, helping the people to change old ideas, consciousness, and habits, and establish new ideas, consciousness, and habits. It should stand at the forefront of class struggle and the struggle between the new and the old, reflect advanced politics and economics as quickly as possible, promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, consolidate and expand the socialist ideological front, and effectively serve the development of social productive forces. Therefore, like socialist economic construction, it also has two different lines and two different sets of working methods: one is to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, go all out, and aim high; the other is to achieve less, slower, poorer, and more costly results, and be right-leaning and conservative. One is vigorous and unstoppable; the other is cold and quiet, fearing the wolf in front and the tiger behind.

All promoters and all true revolutionaries support and resolutely implement the former line. The practice of our cultural and artistic undertakings has also proved that when we adopt the work line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, specifically, when we mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and resolutely implement the Marxist cultural and artistic policy, when we attach importance to cultural and artistic work serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, culture and art closely integrate with politics, inherit the traditions of national culture and art, implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend and a hundred flowers bloom, weeding through the old to bring forth the new, carry out mass cultural and artistic activities, and train a large number of cultural and artistic workers who wholeheartedly serve the people, socialist culture and art will develop more and more healthily and vigorously. Conversely, when implementing the work line of achieving less, slower, poorer, and more costly results, that is, relying only on a few people, only on a few bourgeois intellectuals who have not been reformed, to run cultural and artistic undertakings, violating or deviating from the Marxist cultural and artistic policy, when unilaterally emphasizing improvement (even closing the door for improvement), neglecting popularization work, being obsessed with moving Western things, despising national traditions, and the stench of bourgeois individualism and decadent artistic ideas permeated the literary and art ranks, socialist culture and art will stagnate or even regress. Two work lines, two results, this has been repeatedly proven.

The struggle between the two work lines in culture and art is often, and generally, related to the struggle between the two roads in cultural and artistic work, that is, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road. Because cultural and artistic work is ideological work. Socialist culture and art must reflect socialist politics and economics and promote their continuous development. The leap forward in cultural and artistic work must have a prerequisite, that is, to see whether it is revolutionary culture and art, whether it is culture and art that is beneficial to the socialist cause. That is to say, the development of cultural and artistic undertakings should first conform to the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao. Only cultural and artistic activities and creations that conform to these six criteria do we demand to be more and faster, and do we demand a great leap forward. In cultural and artistic undertakings, which should make a great leap forward, which should make a small leap forward, and which should not make a leap forward, the first thing to look at is their nature. Precisely because of this, the great leap forward in culture first requires a great leap forward in the thinking of cultural and artistic workers.

The primary issue in developing socialist culture and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is that politics must take command. If it is said that politics taking command is the basic guarantee for running all undertakings and all enterprises well, then this is even more true in cultural and artistic work. Because revolutionary culture and art is an important weapon for the proletarian vanguard Communist Party to conduct socialist education among the broad masses of the people, it is always closely linked to class struggle. The lessons of some right-wing elements and anti-Party groups who once seized certain departments of culture and art (such as the Central Academy of Fine Arts, which was seized by the Jiang Feng group), certain regions (such as the cultural departments of Zhejiang, which were seized by the Huang Yuan group, and the cultural departments of Anhui, which were seized by the Dai Yue group), thereby causing great losses to the cultural and artistic undertakings of that department and that region, do they not precisely illustrate that Marxist politics must take command? The struggle between these two roads is often intertwined with the struggle between the two lines in work, and often appears in the form of the struggle between work lines. For example, as long as we close the door for improvement, neglect to absorb rich sources from the broad masses, ignore the ideological transformation of literary and art workers and their connection with the working people, only pay attention to the activities of a few professional art troupes and do not pay attention to giving play to the endless potential of the broad masses, only value foreign and ancient things and do not value Chinese and modern things, only worship the skills and knowledge of a few experts and despise the creativity of the masses, are these merely general ideological methods and work methods? Don't we smell the stench of bourgeois literary and artistic thought from here? Aren't these reflections of the bourgeois worldview? To realize politics taking command, we must wholeheartedly, resolutely, and unswervingly implement the policy of culture and art serving the working people and serving socialism, and we must closely rely on the leadership of the Party. Leaving or resisting the leadership of the Party is the main root cause of errors or straying onto the wrong path in cultural and artistic work.

The line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is also the line of boldly mobilizing the masses and resolutely relying on the masses. Socialist culture and art should not only be oriented towards the masses and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, but should also mobilize the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to create. The important issue here is to correctly solve the problem of popularization and improvement of culture and art. At present and for a considerable period of time to come, the focus of cultural and artistic work should be on popularization. We should focus on popularization, and at the same time gradually improve on the basis of popularization. And this popularization is also carried out under the guidance of improvement. Our popularization is popularization to the masses, and improvement is also improvement from the mass base. Improvement must be in accordance with the standards of the working class and the nation. All culture and art must first have the style of its own class and nation. What can reflect the emotions of the working class and national style is high, otherwise it cannot be considered truly high. Of course, our literary and art workers should also strengthen artistic practice, work hard to study skills, so that our works can truly be loved by the broad masses and move the hearts of readers and audiences. And to create such works, it is by no means just a matter for a few experts, we must vigorously develop the cultural and artistic activities of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and draw endless sources from here. Just look at the hundreds of millions of folk songs that are magnificent and ambitious, which "experts" in the ivory tower can write? That kind of so-called improvement that only knows how to follow and has no originality has no place in the eyes of the people.

To develop socialist culture and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we must resolutely implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend. Socialist culture and art must not cut off history, it must inherit all the excellent national cultural heritage. But this inheritance is by no means valuing the ancient and belittling the present, but on the contrary, it must value the present and belittle the ancient, make the ancient serve the present, weed through the old to bring forth the new. We must conscientiously study and absorb the excellent foreign culture and art. But this kind of learning and absorption can only be used as our reference, we must create our own socialist national new culture, we must never value foreign and belittle Chinese, and be a shameful "cultural comprador." In all cultural and artistic departments, we must adhere to the contention of a hundred schools of thought and the blooming of a hundred flowers, let all kinds of different styles compete, let all kinds of different propositions argue, and never be afraid of contention and blooming. At the same time, we must also adhere to criticism and struggle, and we must weed out poisonous weeds when we see them, and we must criticize errors when we discover them. Abandoning leadership and not conducting criticism is extremely wrong.

To develop socialist culture and art with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we need a strong team that is both red and expert. All cultural and artistic workers must combine with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and conscientiously transform themselves. At the same time, we must also use the greatest strength and the highest degree of enthusiasm to absorb and cultivate new forces from the broad masses of amateur cultural teams of workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is the main force of the working class cultural team. Therefore, the work of "building the army" and "training the soldiers" on the cultural front must be carried out at the same time, so that this team can gradually become red, expert, and deep.

The recent National Conference of Directors of Cultural Bureaus of Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities directly under the Central Government clarified the direction and tasks of building a new national culture and art of socialism, discussed the outline for the development of cultural and artistic work, and proposed the goal of achieving cultural universalization in ten to fifteen years, which is in line with the current situation. Our socialist industrial and agricultural production is riding the wind and waves, galloping forward, the technological revolution and the cultural revolution have begun, and cultural and artistic undertakings urgently need to catch up. Let all our cultural and artistic workers unite as one, be in high spirits, and stride forward with the vigorous momentum of breaking through bamboo!

    多快好省地发展社会主义文化艺术事业
    随着全国范围内工农业生产的大跃进，一个波涛汹涌、轰轰烈烈的文化高潮也正在开始，其中就有文化艺术方面的大跃进。它的主要表现是，大批文化艺术工作者下厂下乡，深入工农，同工农群众共生活，同劳动；文艺团体和大批文艺工作者干劲十足地为工农兵创作和演出，反映现实生活和斗争的创作飞跃增加；群众的文化艺术活动空前活跃，群众的创作空前繁荣。有许多地区到处是诗，到处是壁画，到处是歌声，出现了一个大革命时代所必有的那种歌声遍地、雄壮健康、振奋人心的新局面。
    社会主义文化艺术事业是社会主义建设的一个组成部分，它随着经济基础的发展而发展，反过来又为经济基础服务。社会主义文化艺术事业的主要任务，也就在于通过文化艺术对人民群众进行社会主义的思想教育，帮助人民改变旧的思想、意识、习惯，建立新的思想、意识、习惯。它应当站在阶级斗争和新旧斗争的最前线，尽快地反映先进的政治和经济，兴无灭资，巩固和扩大社会主义的思想阵地，有效地为发展社会生产力服务。因此，它也同社会主义的经济建设一样，有两种不同的路线，两套不同的工作方法：一种是多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游；一种是少慢差费、右倾保守。一种是轰轰烈烈，势如破竹；一种是冷冷清清，前怕狼后怕虎。
    一切促进派，一切真正的革命者，都是拥护和坚决贯彻前一种路线的。我们的文化艺术事业的实践也证明：当我们采取多快好省的工作路线的时候，具体说来，也就是发动群众、依靠群众、坚决贯彻马克思主义的文化艺术方针的时候，当我们重视文化艺术工作为工农兵服务，文化艺术同政治紧密结合，继承民族文化艺术传统，贯彻百家争鸣、百花齐放和推陈出新的方针，展开群众文化艺术活动，培养大批全心全意为人民服务的文化艺术工作者的时候，社会主义文化艺术事业就日益健康地、蓬勃地发展。与此相反，当执行少慢差费的工作路线的时候，也就是只依靠少数人、只依靠少数未经改造的资产阶级知识分子办文化艺术事业，违背或离开马克思主义的文化艺术方针的时候，当片面地强调提高（甚至关门提高），轻视普及工作，醉心于搬西洋的东西，鄙视民族传统，在文艺队伍里弥漫了资产阶级个人主义和腐朽艺术思想的霉味的时候，社会主义文化艺术事业就会停滞不前，甚至倒退。两种工作路线，两种结果，这是屡验不爽的。
    在文化艺术上两种工作路线的斗争，常常是而且一般是同文化艺术工作中的两条道路的斗争，即社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争相联系着的。因为文化艺术工作是思想工作。社会主义的文化艺术必须反映社会主义的政治和经济，并且促进它们不断往前发展。文化艺术工作的跃进，必须有个前提，就是要看它是否是革命的文化艺术，是否是有利于社会主义事业的文化艺术。这就是说，文化艺术事业的发展，首先应该符合于毛主席所提出的六项政治标准。只有符合于这六项标准的文化艺术活动和创作，我们才要求又多又快，才要求大大跃进。在文化艺术事业中，哪些该大跃进，哪些该少跃进，哪些不该跃进，首先要看它们的性质。正因为这样，文化的大跃进首先要求文化艺术者的思想大跃进。
    多快好省地发展社会主义文化艺术事业的首要问题，是政治必须挂帅。如果说，政治挂帅是办好一切事业、一切企业的基本保证，那么在文化艺术工作上更加如此。因为革命的文化艺术是无产阶级先锋队共产党对广大人民进行社会主义教育的重要武器，它时时刻刻同阶级斗争相联系着。一些右派分子、反党集团曾经窃据文化艺术的某些部门（如中央美术学院为江丰集团所窃据）、某些地区（如浙江的文化部门为黄源集团所窃据、安徽的文化部门为戴岳集团所窃据）从而使那个部门、那个地区的文化艺术事业遭受到很大损失的教训，不正是说明马克思主义的政治必须挂帅吗？这两条道路的斗争，是经常同工作上两种路线的斗争交叉着的，而且时常以工作路线的斗争形式出现的。例如只要关门提高，轻视从广大群众中吸取丰富的源泉，忽略文艺工作者的思想改造及其同劳动人民的联系，只注意少数专业艺术团体的活动而不注意发挥广大群众中的无穷无尽的潜力，只重视外国的、古代的东西而不重视中国的、现代的东西，只崇拜少数专家的技巧和知识而轻视群众的创造，这些难道都仅仅是一般思想方法和工作方法的问题吗？难道我们从这里不正是嗅到资产阶级文艺思想的臭气吗？难道这些不正是资产阶级世界观的反映吗？要实现政治挂帅，就要全心全意地、坚决地、始终不渝地实行文化艺术为劳动人民服务、为社会主义服务的方针，就要紧密地依靠党的领导。离开或抗拒党的领导，是文化艺术工作发生错误或走上歧路的主要根源。　
    多快好省的路线，又是放手发动群众、坚决依靠群众的路线。社会主义的文化艺术不仅是应该面向群众，为工农兵群众服务，而且也应该发动广大工农兵群众来创造。这里的重要问题，是正确解决文化艺术的普及与提高的问题。当前和在今后一个相当长的时期内，文化艺术工作的重点应该是普及。我们应该以普及为主，同时在普及的基础上逐步地提高。而这个普及也是在提高的指导下进行的。我们的普及是向群众的普及，提高也是从群众基础上的提高。提高必须按照工人阶级的、民族的标准。一切文化艺术必须首先有自己阶级的、民族的风格。能够反映劳动阶级情感、民族风格的，就是高，否则就不能算真正的高。当然，我们的文艺工作者还应当加强艺术实践，努力钻研技巧，使我们的作品真正能为广大群众所喜爱，打动读者、观众的心灵。而要创造这种作品，决不仅仅是少数专家的事，必须大力发展工农兵群众的文化艺术活动，从这里来吸取无穷无尽的源泉。试看那气吞河岳、壮志凌云的亿万首民歌，有哪个象牙之塔里的“专家”们能写出的呢？那种只知因袭、没有独创的所谓提高，在人民群众眼里，是没有地位的。
    要多快好省地发展社会主义文化艺术事业，必须坚决贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针。社会主义的文化艺术，决不能割断历史，它必须继承一切优秀的民族文化遗产。但是这个继承，决不是厚古薄今，而要截然相反，必须厚今薄古，古为今用，推陈出新。对于外国的优秀文化艺术我们必须认真学习和吸收。但是这种学习和吸收，只能作为我们的借鉴，我们必须创造出自己的社会主义的民族的新文化，我们决不可以重外轻中，当可耻的“文化买办”。在一切文化艺术部门必须坚持百家争鸣、百花齐放，让各种不同的风格竞赛，让各种不同的主张争辩，决不要怕鸣怕放。同时我们还要坚持批评和斗争，见到毒草就要锄掉，发现错误就要批评。放弃领导和不进行批评是极端错误的。
    多快好省地发展社会主义文化艺术事业，需要一支强大的又红又专的队伍。一切文化艺术工作者必须同工农兵群众结合，认真地改造自己。同时，还必须用最大的力量和最高度的热情，从广大工农兵业余文化队伍里吸收和培养新生力量。这是工人阶级文化队伍的主力军。因此，文化战线上“建军”和“练兵”的工作要同时进行，使这支队伍逐步做到红透专深。
    最近举行的全国省、自治区、直辖市文化局长会议上，明确了建设社会主义的民族的新文化艺术的方针和任务，讨论了发展文化艺术工作的纲要，提出了十年到十五年实现文化大普及的目标，是符合当前的形势的。我们的社会主义工农业生产正在乘风破浪、万马奔腾地向前迈进，技术革命和文化革命已经开始，亟需文化艺术事业迎头赶上。让我们全体文化艺术工作者万众一心，精神焕发，以轰轰烈烈的破竹之势大踏步前进吧！
