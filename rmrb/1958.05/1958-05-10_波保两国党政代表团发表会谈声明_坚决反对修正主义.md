Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 8th May: The Bulgarian Telegraph Agency today published a statement by the party central committees and government delegations of Bulgaria and Poland.

The statement indicates that the Polish party and government delegation, led by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Cyrankiewicz, visited Bulgaria from May 5th to 9th and held talks with the Bulgarian party and government representatives in an atmosphere of fraternal friendship and mutual understanding. The two sides exchanged views on the current international situation, the international workers' movement, and the further development of cooperation between the two countries and two parties. The views of both sides on the issues discussed were completely identical.

Regarding the current international situation, the statement points out that the most important issue for humanity at present is to eliminate the danger of nuclear weapons and reach an agreement on the prohibition of the use and production of such weapons, and the cessation of nuclear weapons testing is the first important step in this direction. The statement expresses full support for the resolution of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on the unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing and the proposal to hold a summit conference.

The statement emphasizes that trying to include the issue of the social systems of certain countries on the agenda of the summit conference is an intolerable attempt to interfere in the internal affairs of these countries.

The statement declares both sides’ agreement on the abolition of military blocs and believes that as long as the North Atlantic Treaty exists, as long as the imperialist forces hinder the relaxation of international tensions and the consolidation of peace and continue to implement the policy of arms expansion and war preparation, the Warsaw Treaty is necessary and is a guarantee of the security and independence of the socialist camp countries.

Both sides are deeply convinced that close cooperation and fraternal solidarity among the socialist countries are of great significance for strengthening the forces of peace, progress, and socialism developing throughout the world.

The statement points out that the representatives of the two parties held talks in a fraternal atmosphere on cooperation and relations between the two parties. According to the declaration of the Moscow meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and the "Peace Manifesto," the two parties believe that, adhering to the principle of internationalism, they will further expand cooperation to benefit the socialist construction of both countries. The two parties will enhance the unity of socialist countries and work for the development of socialism and the forces of world progress. The two parties believe that the ideological unity of the party is a condition for the victorious realization of socialist construction. To strengthen this unity, it is necessary to carry out a principled struggle against any distortions and departures from Marxism-Leninism. This means that it is necessary to fight against revisionism, the main danger in the international workers' movement, because it attacks the foundations of Marxism-Leninism; it is necessary to constantly overcome sectarianism and dogmatism.

Regarding the cooperation between the two countries and the prospects for further development, both sides believe that it is necessary for the two countries to sign long-term trade agreements for 1959 to 1960 and 1961 to 1965 this year. Both sides also reached an agreement on the establishment of a standing committee for Bulgarian-Polish economic and scientific-technological cooperation.

The statement was signed by Zhivkov and Yugov on the Bulgarian side, and Gomulka and Cyrankiewicz on the Polish side.

This newspaper comprehensive report, according to Xinhua News Agency, the Polish party and government delegation, led by First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, Gomulka, arrived in Sofia on the 5th. Members of the delegation included Cyranciewicz, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, and Ochab, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party and Minister of Agriculture.

The Polish party and government delegation made a five-day visit to Bulgaria and was warmly welcomed by the Bulgarian party and government leaders and the Bulgarian people. On the afternoon of the 8th, the citizens of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria, held a grand mass welcome rally for the Polish guests. The leaders of Bulgaria and Poland held cordial and friendly talks. The Polish party and government delegation left Bulgaria on the 9th and arrived in Budapest for a friendly visit.

    波保两国党政代表团发表会谈声明
    坚决反对修正主义
    新华社索非亚8日电　保加利亚通讯社今天发表了保加利亚和波兰两国的党中央委员会和政府代表团的声明。
    声明指出，以统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡和部长会议主席西伦凯维兹为首的波兰党和政府代表团从5日到9日在保加利亚进行了访问，同保加利亚的党和政府代表在兄弟友好和相互谅解的气氛中进行了交谈。双方就有关目前国际局势、国际工人运动和进一步发展两国和两党的合作等问题交换了意见。双方对所讨论问题的观点是完全一致的。
    关于目前国际局势，声明指出，目前对人类说来，最重要的问题是消除核武器危险，就禁止使用和生产这种武器达成协议，而停止核武器试验是这方面的第一个重要步骤。声明表示完全支持苏联最高苏维埃关于单方面停止核武器试验的决议和关于举行最高级会议的建议。
    声明强调指出，极力要把关于某些国家的社会制度问题列入最高级会议议程，是阴谋干涉这些国家内政的不可容忍的企图。
    声明表明了双方赞同取消军事集团的立场，并且认为，只要北大西洋公约存在，只要帝国主义势力阻碍缓和国际紧张局势和巩固和平并继续执行扩军备战政策，华沙条约就是必需的，而且是社会主义阵营各国安全和独立的保证。
    双方深信，社会主义各国的密切合作和兄弟团结，对增强在世界各地发展着的和平、进步和社会主义力量具有重要意义。
    声明指出，两国党的代表在兄弟般的气氛中举行了关于两国党的合作和关系的交谈。根据社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言和“和平宣言”，两党认为，忠于国际主义原则的两党将进一步扩大两国合作，以利于两国的社会主义建设。两党将增进社会主义各国团结和为发展社会主义和世界进步力量进行工作。两党认为，党的思想团结是胜利实现社会主义建设的条件。为了加强这种团结，必须进行原则斗争，反对任何歪曲和离开马克思列宁主义的现象。这就是说，必须为反对国际工人运动中的主要危险——修正主义而进行斗争，因为它攻击马克思列宁主义的基础；必须不断克服宗派主义和教条主义。
    关于两国的合作和进一步发展前景，双方认为，今年两国有必要签订1959年到1960年和1961年到1965年的长期贸易协定。双方还就建立保波经济和科学技术合作常设委员会问题达成了协议。
    在声明上签字的，保加利亚方面是日夫科夫和于哥夫，波兰方面是哥穆尔卡和西伦凯维兹。
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：以波兰统一工人党中央委员会第一书记哥穆尔卡为首的波兰党和政府代表团是于5日到达索非亚的。代表团成员包括波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、部长会议主席西伦凯维兹、统一工人党中央政治局委员、农业部长奥哈布等。
    波兰党和政府代表团在保加利亚进行了为期五天的访问，受到了保加利亚党政领导人和保加利亚人民的热烈欢迎。8日下午，保加利亚首都索非亚的市民曾为波兰贵宾举行盛大的群众欢迎会。保波两国领袖曾经进行了亲切友好的会谈。波兰党和政府代表团，已于9日离开保加利亚到达布达佩斯，进行友好访问。
