A small animal-powered wheat harvester, converted from the frame of a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow in Shaanxi Province, was designed jointly by the famous "Living Luban" Liu Hengjie, a farmer from Weinan, the young agricultural tool innovator Liang Zhongling, and scientists from the Agricultural Machinery Research Institute of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. After on-site appraisal by farmers and innovators from more than ten counties and cities, as well as relevant scientific departments, this wheat harvester has been formally recommended as a basically mature harvesting tool.

The modification technology for this small animal-powered wheat harvester is very simple. Just remove the plowshare and depth adjuster of the double-wheeled double-furrow plow, reverse the plow frame, and move the ground wheel forward a bit to create the frame of the animal-powered wheat harvester. Then, make a pair of spur gears, a pair of bevel gears, and an eccentric wheel. Connect the gears to each other with two shafts and install them in the middle of the double-wheeled double-furrow plow frame. The cutter part is the same as the cutter on the horse-drawn harvester, only shorter. The harvesting platform is made of thin wooden boards. During harvesting, the animal pulls the body, and as the body moves forward, the ground wheel rotates, driving the two sets of gears and the eccentric wheel. The eccentric wheel drives the connecting rod, which moves the cutter left and right, cutting the wheat.

The front view is from the front of the harvesting direction, and the top view is from above. As can be seen from the diagram, the harvesting platform and the stationary cutter bar are connected to the front of the double-wheeled double-furrow plow frame with a curved iron plate, and an eccentric wheel is installed in front of the plow frame. The connecting rod connecting the power rod is fitted with a sliding sleeve on the eccentric pin of the eccentric wheel. When the eccentric wheel rotates, the connecting rod drives the power rod to move left and right in front of the harvesting platform for cutting. The eccentric wheel is rotated by the ground wheel through the gears. The gears are in two sets installed inside and outside the double-wheeled double-furrow plow frame cabinet. A large gear (35 teeth) is fixed on the ground wheel shaft. A shaft is installed behind the plow frame, on which a small gear and a large bevel gear are fixed. Then a vertical shaft is installed, on which a small bevel gear and an eccentric wheel are fixed. All additional shafts are connected to the plow frame with sliding bearings. In addition, a sprocket is fixed to the left end of the ground wheel shaft, and the wooden turning wheel above the harvesting platform is rotated by chain transmission to push the wheat backward to facilitate cutting. The two sides of the harvesting platform are inclined guard plates, and the divider bars installed in front of the guard plates are wide in the front and narrow in the back, as can also be seen from the front view.

    双轮双铧犁改成割麦机
    陕西省用双轮双铧犁的架子改装成的小型畜力割麦机，是闻名的“活鲁班”、渭南农民刘恒杰和青年农具革新者梁忠凌与中国科学院陕西分院农业机械研究所的科学家共同研究设计的。这种割麦机经十多个县市农民创造家和有关科学部门的现场鉴定，被正式推荐为基本成熟的收割工具。
    这种小型畜力割麦机改装技术非常简单。只要先把双轮双铧犁的犁头和深浅调节器取掉，并把犁架反转，把地轮向前移动一下，就成了畜力割麦机的架子。然后，再做一对直齿轮，一对八字轮和一个偏心轮，用两根轴把齿轮互相连接起来，装在双轮双铧犁的架子中间。剪刀部分和马拉收割机上的剪刀样子一样，只是短一些。收割台是用薄木板做的。收割时是由牲口拉动机身，随着机身前进，地轮转动，带动两套齿轮和偏心轮；偏心轮带动连杆，就使剪刀左右活动，麦子就被剪割下来了。
    前视图是从收割方向的前方看，顶视图是由上往下看。由图中可看出收割台与定刀杆是用一根弯形铁板连接在双轮双铧犁架子的前面，而在犁架前面同时安装着偏心轮，连接动力杆的连杆是用滑套装在偏心轮的偏心肖子上。当偏心轮转动时，连杆带动动力杆在收割台前左右移动切割。偏心轮是由地轮经过齿轮转动而转动的，齿轮为两组装在双轮双铧犁架柜内外，在地轮轴上固定大齿轮（35齿），在犁架后方安装一轴，轴上固定小齿轮及大八字轮，再安装一纵轴，轴上固定小八字轮及偏心轮，所有另加之轴都用滑动轴承连接在犁架上。另外在地轮轴的左端固定一链轮，由链传动收割台上方的木翻轮转动，把麦向后拨以便于进行切割。收割台两侧为倾斜的护板，而在护板前方安装的分麦杆前宽后窄，由前视图也可看出。（附图片）
