Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 6th. The workers of the western adit of the Zhongliangshan Coal Mine in Chongqing created a national record of 302.53 meters of adit advancement in April.

	The production conditions of the western adit are not very good, all the dregs are manually removed, and the rock is very hard. However, the adit workers overcame the difficulties, adopted the advanced experience of the Soviet mine construction four-shift operation, improved labor organization, and completed the original thirty-two hours of work in twenty-four hours a day. When the rock was hard, the workers adopted "shallow-hole multi-cycle operation", paying attention to the drilling angle, which greatly improved the footage and blasting rate. They also created a method of widening the sidewalls of the adit at intervals to overcome the slow slag transportation, so that the slag removal efficiency reached a maximum of 107 cars.

	Due to technological innovation, a national record of 21.2 meters of adit excavation per day was also created on April 24.

### 中梁山平硐日进21.2公尺

    中梁山平硐日进21.2公尺
    据新华社重庆6日电　重庆中梁山煤矿工地西翼平硐职工4月份创造平硐月进三百零二点五三公尺的全国纪录。
    西翼平硐生产条件不太好，全部是人工出碴，岩石很坚硬。但是，平硐职工战胜了困难，采用苏联矿井建设四班作业的先进经验，改进劳动组织，一天二十四小时可以做原来三十二小时的工程量。岩石硬时，工人就采用“浅眼多循环作业”，注意打眼角度，大大提高了进尺和爆破率。他们还创造了将硐壁每隔一段就打宽一些的办法，克服出碴运输慢的困难，使出碴效率最高达到一百零七车。
    由于革新技术，4月24日还创造了平硐掘进日进二十一点二公尺的全国纪录。
