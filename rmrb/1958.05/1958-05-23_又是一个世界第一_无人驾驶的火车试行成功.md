Socialism is Superior to Capitalism
Leaps and Bounds in Soviet Science and Technology
Another World First
Unmanned Train Successfully Tested
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 22nd. The "Soviet Russia" newspaper recently reported on another successful test run of the world's first unmanned train. This train, driven by the world's first automatic control system, ran very successfully on the section of railway from Kuntsevo to Usovo in the Soviet Union.

This test was conducted by train number 5003. The train left Kuntsevo station on time, passed Romashkovo, Razdory and other stations on time, and finally arrived at Usovo station on time. The train started smoothly, and no bumping was felt at all. Along the way, the automatic device constantly performed traction calculations, selecting the best driving conditions. In its calculations, it took into account all factors such as line conditions, traction machinery and brake performance, train weight, timetable, and speed limits. Saperkin, an engineer from the Moscow Underground Railway who participated in the observation of this test, said that it was hard to believe that the train was being driven by instruments.

No driver can be seen next to the controller in the locomotive driver's cab. Here there are many wires, control instruments, and various switches. The automatic driver's "electronic brain" is a mathematical machine that can solve the complex differential equations of train operation. There is also a "memory device" with some boxes containing coded information, which contains information about line conditions and the information needed to select train operating conditions. The automatic device can also obtain necessary information about the actual speed of the train and the track it is passing through from special sensors installed in the wheel axle boxes.

Engineer Nikolaev, who led the design of the automatic control system, pointed out when talking about the advantages of this device that a train driven by this device can accurately execute the timetable, increase the carrying capacity of the road, save power, and ensure operational safety. The article pointed out that engineers are still making further improvements based on the test situation. (Attached picture)

    又是一个世界第一
    无人驾驶的火车试行成功
    新华社莫斯科22日电　“苏维埃俄罗斯报”最近报道了世界上第一列无人驾驶的火车的另一次试验行驶的情况。这列由世界上第一个自动操纵系统驾驶的火车，在苏联孔切沃到乌索沃的一段铁路上行驶得非常成功。
    这次试验是由五○○三次列车进行的。列车正点离开孔切沃车站以后，正点经过罗马什科沃、拉兹多雷等站，最后正点到达乌索沃站。列车的起动很平稳，感觉不到一点碰撞。沿途自动装置不断进行牵引计算，选择最好的行驶条件。它在计算时，把线路情况、牵引机械和制动机性能、列车重量、行车时刻表、速度限制等一切情况都考虑到了。参加观察这次试验的莫斯科地下电车工程师萨佩尔金说，很难相信这列车竟是由仪器驾驶的。
    在机车司机室的控制器旁看不到司机。这里有许多电线、控制仪器、各种各样开关。自动司机的“电子脑”，是一部数学机器，它可以解开列车运行的复杂的微分方程式。另外还有一个“记忆装置”，带有一些装电码情报的盒子，盒里装着关于线路情况以及选择列车运行条件所需的情报。自动装置还可以从装在车轮轴箱中的特制传感器获得有关列车实际速度、通过的线路等必要的情报。
    领导设计自动操纵系统的尼古拉耶夫工程师，在谈到这种装置的优点时指出，由这种装置驾驶的列车，可以准确地执行行车时刻表，增加道路的通过能力，节约动力，保证运行安全。文章指出，工程师们还在根据试验情况作进一步改进。（附图片）
