Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th: The Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs today sent representatives to the US Embassy in Japan to protest the United States' reckless holding of nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific, disregarding the demands of people all over the world and the Soviet Union's initiative to stop nuclear weapons tests.
    The council's five representatives met with a representative of the US Ambassador and handed him the council's letter of protest to the US President. The letter of protest also requested that the United States agree to hold a summit meeting of great powers to promote the early realization of a nuclear weapons ban treaty.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: Disregarding the solemn demands of people all over the world, the United States has begun a series of nuclear weapons tests on Eniwetok Atoll in the Pacific, starting on April 28th. The US Atomic Energy Commission was forced to announce this news on the 7th.
    According to Democratic Congressman Porter, who just returned to Washington from the test area, the United States plans to conduct thirty tests. He said he was forbidden to disclose the nature of the nuclear weapons that have been tested.

Xinhua News Agency, Honolulu, 8th: Honolulu courts on the 7th unreasonably convicted four American pacifists, led by Bigelow, of contempt of court.

These four people risked their lives by sailing on the "Golden Rule" yacht to Eniwetok Atoll to protest US nuclear tests. After arriving in Honolulu at the end of April, they were subjected to various obstructions and threats from the local US judicial authorities, and were finally arrested on May 1.

They were sentenced to sixty days in prison, suspended for one year.

    日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会
    抗议美国进行核试验
    据新华社9日讯　东京消息：日本禁止原子弹和氢弹协议会今天派代表到美国驻日本大使馆抗议美国不顾全世界人民的要求和苏联关于停止核武器试验的倡议，悍然在太平洋的恩纳威托克岛举行核武器试验。
    协议会的五个代表会见了美国大使的代表，向他递交了协议会给美国总统的抗议书。抗议书并要求美国同意举行大国首脑会议促使禁止核武器协定早日实现。
    据新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：不顾全世界人民的严正要求，美国已经从4月28日起在太平洋上的恩纳威托克岛开始一系列核武器试验。美国原子能委员会7日被迫宣布了这个消息。
    据刚从试验地区回到华盛顿的民主党众议员波特尔说，美国打算进行三十次试验。他说，他被禁止泄漏已经试验的核武器的性质。
    据新华社8日讯　檀香山消息：檀香山的法院7日无理判决以比吉洛为首的四个美国和平人士以蔑视法庭罪。
    这四个人是乘座“金律”号小艇冒生命危险去恩纳威托克岛抗议美国核试验的。他们在4月底到达檀香山后即受到当地美国司法机关的多方阻挠和威胁，并且最后在5月1日被逮捕起来。
    他们被判处六十天的徒刑，缓期一年执行。
