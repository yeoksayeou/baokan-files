Socialist Blossoms Unfurled
Chen Bochui

　　The receptionist at the Luoyang First Tractor Factory seemed to be a master storyteller. He spoke about the history of the factory’s construction, right up to the manufacturing of the tractors – a moving story from beginning to end.

　　He flicked his cigarette ash, then smiled mysteriously. "You've come at a very opportune time today. Wait for the excitement at ten o'clock.”

　　We were all perplexed, staring at him blankly.

　　Then this comrade supplemented, "Constructing and managing a tractor factory means encountering difficulties at every turn, not only in scientific knowledge and technology, but even after selecting the factory site, relocating more than eighty households also presented a great challenge…” He took a puff of his cigarette, looked at us, and continued, “Just think, farmers have lived here for generations – in Tangtun, born here, grown up here, fed here, and with their ancestral graves here. They endured the natural disasters and man-made calamities under the reactionary rule with great difficulty, and finally came to good days after the land reform, but now they are asked to move their homes; of course, they are unwilling in every way. Therefore, even though a new Tangtun was planned for them, houses were built, and land was distributed, we still had to persuade and persuade until we were hoarse before they reluctantly and gradually moved away."

　　He paused, then raised his voice powerfully, turning the topic. "But..."

　　Just as he said this, the sound of gongs and drums came into the reception room from outside.

　　The receptionist nodded and smiled again. "Alright, I won't talk anymore. Let's go out and see the scene."

　　We walked to the factory gate and saw a procession, led by the national flag, winding its way from the yellow earth ridges, with the gongs and drums sounding loudly. The colorful flags fluttered in the wind, set against a large expanse of green wheat fields, truly a moving picture!

　　The procession stopped in the square in front of the factory. The factory workers surged out to welcome them, applauding together, like firecrackers being set off during a festival.

　　Suddenly, the pounding of drums resounded loudly; a dozen large gongs surrounded four large drums arranged in a circle, beating in coordination with the drums, with varying degrees of emphasis and speed. The cymbals also crashed together one by one, making rhythmic, crisp sounds, which were very pleasant to hear. This was truly a wonderful band, fully expressing the excitement and joy in the hearts of the farmers in the midst of the great leap forward nationwide. Especially the four drummers, striking the big drums with all their might, dancing as they drummed to the music, were the most beautiful and powerful postures under the painter's brush. Seeing the energy with which they beat the gongs and drums, one could imagine their courageous spirit in production.

　　But they were not there to perform, but to express their gratitude.

　　Before Labor Day on May 1st, in order to present a gift to the Party and the government for the holiday, the workers of the First Tractor Factory had worked continuously in the workshop for twenty-eight hours, finally completing twenty small tractors (fifteen to twenty horsepower). They donated one to the Yangzong Township Third Agricultural Production Cooperative, which used to live in Tangtun and had to relocate because of the factory construction. This "machine cow" can plow forty mu of land every day, and the farmers greatly loved it. In order to thank the factory and the worker brothers for supporting the cooperative's agricultural production, they specially formed a team to express their gratitude.

　　When this team was welcomed into the factory gate, one could see the gift-giving team behind the band; in addition to four people carrying a large mirror frame together, there were also four slaughtered fat pigs, several sacks of peanuts filled to the brim, as well as live chickens, large chicken eggs, and fresh red cherries just picked from the trees, covered with green leaves. At the very end of the team followed gray-haired grandfathers and grandmothers, all with joyful expressions, shining with surprised eyes, looking at the tall factory buildings made of red brick. The former "grave mound" has now become such a huge, strange factory that can produce "machine cows". This is the most unforgettable and moving thing in their lives. Therefore, after giving the gifts, they will also use half a day of labor for voluntary labor for the factory – leveling the base. They understood, and saw clearly, that the earlier the factory is completed and put into production, the earlier the agricultural cooperative can reach or exceed its production targets. The more developed industry is, the more promising agriculture is.

　　If this is a happy event in the high tide of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in Luoyang, then on our vast land of the motherland, in the star-studded cities, I don't know how many such glorious and miraculous happy events – socialist blossoms in full bloom – there are! The idiom "like bamboo shoots after a spring rain" is not enough, it is far from reality.

　　社会主义放出来的花朵
　　陈伯吹
    洛阳第一拖拉机制造厂的招待员同志仿佛是个讲故事的能手。他谈了建厂的历史，直到拖拉机制造出厂，从头至尾，整个是动人的故事。
    他掸了掸烟卷儿，忽然地微笑了一下，很神秘的样子。“今天诸位来得很凑巧，等着十点钟瞧热闹吧。”
    我们都迷惑了，楞着眼睛望他。
    然后这位同志又补叙着：“建设和管理一个拖拉机厂，不仅在科学知识和技术方面，要处处碰到困难；就是在选定厂址以后，迁移八十多户人家也碰上了很大的难关……”他吸了一口烟，望了望我们又说下去：“你们请想想，农民世世代代住在这儿——唐屯，生于斯、长于斯、食于斯，还加上祖宗坟墓在焉，他们千辛万苦地挨过了反动统治下的天灾人祸，来到土地改革以后的好日子，却要他们搬起家来，当然是一百个不愿意。所以尽管为他们规划了一个新的唐屯，盖了房子，分了田地，还不免舌敝唇焦地劝说又劝说，才勉勉强强、陆陆续续地搬走了。”
    他顿了一下，却提高了嗓门有力地一转。“但是，……”
    正说了这么一句，外面的锣鼓声传进了会客室里来。
    招待员同志点了点头，又微笑了一下。“好吧，我就不讲了，出去瞧瞧场面吧。”
    我们走到厂门外，望见一支以国旗为前导的队伍，锣鼓喧天地从黄土的田埂上蜿蜒而来，彩色的旗子迎风飘扬，背后衬着一大片绿油油的麦田，真是一幅动人的图景！
    队伍在工厂前面的广场上停下来。厂里的职工们涌出来欢迎，一齐鼓起掌来，仿佛节日里放鞭炮似的。
    突然咚咚的鼓声震耳地擂起来；十几面大锣围着四个大鼓排开圆阵，配合着鼓，轻重缓急地敲起来；铙钹也一下一下地磕碰着，发出有节奏的清脆的声音，非常动听。这真是一个奇妙的乐队，充分表现出农民在全国大跃进的形势中内心的激动和快活；特别是四个擂鼓手，全身扑打着大鼓，随着乐声且擂且舞，是画家笔底下最美丽的、最有力的姿态。看到他们敲锣打鼓的这股劲儿，也就能想像他们在生产上勇猛的干劲了。
    但是，他们不是为了表演，而是为了答谢而来的。
    第一拖拉机制造厂在五一劳动节前，为了在节日向党和政府献礼，工人们曾经连续地在车间工作了二十八个小时，终于完成了二十台小型拖拉机（十五——二十马力），他们把一台赠送给从前住在唐屯，因为建厂而不得不迁移出去的、现在就是杨冢乡第三农业生产合作社。这台“机器牛”每天能耕四十亩地，农民们大大地喜欢它，为了感谢厂和工人兄弟支援社的农业大生产，特地组成了队伍，前来答谢。
    当这支队伍被欢迎进入工厂大门时，可以看到在乐队后面的送礼队；除了四个人合抬了一架大镜框外，还有四头宰好的肥猪，装得鼓鼓的好几麻袋花生以及活鸡、大鸡子儿和刚从树上摘下来鲜红的盖着绿叶的樱桃。队伍的最后面跟着须发斑白的老爷爷和老奶奶，他们都喜形于色，闪着惊异的眼光，望着红砖砌的高大的厂房，从前的“坟头地”，而今变成这么一个巨大的、能够造出“机器牛”来的奇异工厂，这是他们一生中所最忘不了的、也最感动的一件事。所以他们送过礼以后，还要用半个劳动日来为工厂义务劳动——铲平基地。他们明白了，看清楚了，工厂提早一天全部完成投入生产，农业合作社也可以提早一天达到或者超额完成生产指标。工业愈发达，农业愈有前途。
    如果说，这是洛阳在工农业生产高潮大跃进中的一件喜事，那么，在咱们祖国辽阔广大的土地上，星罗棋布的城市里，这样光辉的奇迹般的喜事——社会主义怒放出来的花朵，不知有多少呢！“雨后春笋”这个形容词儿还很不够，还远远地脱离着实际呢。
