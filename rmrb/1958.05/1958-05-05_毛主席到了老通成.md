    Chairman Mao Visits Lao Tong Cheng
    Whenever the master chef Zeng Yanling, who makes Sanxian Doupi (Three Delicacies Bean Curd Sheet), talks about shaking hands with Chairman Mao, he excitedly says, "I hadn't even had time to wash my hands, and Chairman Mao reached out his hand. Chairman Mao held my hand tightly. It was as if a current of heat ran through my whole body, making me feel all fired up. I thought: Chairman Mao, he is so concerned about us!"
    Zeng Yanling is the top chef in Lao Tong Cheng for making Doupi. For a long time, he had a wish: "If only I could go to Beijing, see Chairman Mao, and, best of all, have Chairman Mao taste the Doupi I made myself. That would satisfy me for the rest of my life." Sometimes he would think about it and believe his wish would come true, but sometimes he would think about it and find his idea a bit amusing. He never expected that his honest wish, tinged with a bit of fantasy, would actually come true in Wuhan without him having to go to Beijing.
    This is how it happened.
    April 3, 1958, 7:00 PM.
    In the Lao Tong Cheng restaurant in Huaqiao, the customers were no longer as crowded as during the day. Only two or three tables were occupied in the dining hall. The Wang family, with three-year-old Wang Xibin and his four older siblings, along with his parents, a family of seven, were the last to arrive. They were eating braised dishes and talking about something, while Binbin's mother, Liu Yanru, was pondering something in her mind.
    Suddenly, the sound of cars was heard outside. Soon, several people came in. At first, everyone thought they were new customers, but the first one in was none other than Comrade Wang Renzhong, the Provincial Party Secretary. After entering, he turned to gesture for the people behind him to come in. Then, a man with a wide forehead, black hair, a robust build, and wearing a grey uniform walked in with steady steps. Everyone was stunned. Wasn't that familiar face, build, and demeanor Chairman Mao himself? Everyone stood up abruptly, staring blankly, not knowing what to say. In that instant, the children were the quickest to react. Binbin, first, in a loud voice, pointed his clean little finger at Chairman Mao and shouted, "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao!" Binbin's older siblings also flocked to Chairman Mao's side in unison. Five-year-old girl Xijiang approached Chairman Mao, held onto the corner of his clothes, and asked:
    "Chairman Mao, did you come from Beijing?"
    "Yes!" Chairman Mao replied kindly.
    Chairman Mao shook hands with each of the children, stroking their heads. Binbin's mother, at this moment, was so excited that she forgot everything. Seeing Chairman Mao walk straight to her table, she remembered to step forward and shake hands with Chairman Mao, greeting him. Chairman Mao asked where she and her husband worked, then looked around and waved to everyone. He then turned to look at the posters on the wall about eliminating the Four Pests and the Great Leap Forward, reading them aloud as he looked. Then he asked Comrade Wan Shuming, the manager standing nearby:
    "Did you write these?"
    "Yes," Wan Shuming replied.
    "Good, good, good," Chairman Mao said.
    Chairman Mao looked at the wall again, asking with interest:
    "What is this wall made of?"
    "It's made of particleboard, very economical," Wan Shuming said.
    After listening to the introduction, Chairman Mao did not sit down but walked straight to the kitchen. As soon as he stepped into the kitchen door, Chairman Mao waved to everyone and greeted, "You've worked hard! You've worked hard!"
    The workers in the kitchen didn't know that Chairman Mao had arrived before this! The first to see Chairman Mao was Master Zhong Shengchu, who makes soup dumplings. He had just finished pinching the dumplings, putting them in the steamer, and was about to put on the lid when Chairman Mao came to him. Master Zhong was stunned. Seeing Chairman Mao's radiant face and energetic appearance, he thought that Chairman Mao didn't look like someone in his sixties. Chairman Mao being so healthy was the happiness of the Chinese people. He wanted to say a few words of blessing, but he couldn't say a single word, just staring blankly at Chairman Mao with a smile. When Chairman Mao pointed to the dumplings on the chopping board and asked him, "What kind of dumplings are these?" he actually forgot to answer. It wasn't until Chairman Mao asked him a second time, "Who made these dumplings?" that he woke up as if from a dream and said, "These are soup dumplings, I made them."
    The whole kitchen came alive. Chairman Mao's kind smile, approachable demeanor, and amiable conversation completely dissolved the slight tension that everyone had.
    Chairman Mao then asked Master Zeng, "What do you do?"
    Master Zeng said, "I make Doupi."
    After answering, Master Zeng thought he should ask Chairman Mao to eat some good Doupi, so he said to Chairman Mao, "I'm going to specially make some good Doupi for you to eat."
    Chairman Mao looked at Master Zeng kindly and said, "You are too thoughtful."
    Master Zeng said, "I always wish you good health!"
    Chairman Mao continued to walk forward, came to the stove, touched the stove surface with his hand, and seeing that there was no dust on his fingers, praised everyone, saying, "This stove is very clean!"
    Then, Chairman Mao also talked with Chef Li Hanqing and some other chefs.
    Walking along the side of the stove to the dormitory door, Chairman Mao went in to look at the dormitory. Seeing that the dormitory was very tidy, Chairman Mao said, "Very good, very good."
    After meeting everyone, Chairman Mao said to the comrades who came with him, let's eat here today. It turned out that Chairman Mao and several other comrades had not yet had dinner!
    Hearing that Chairman Mao was eating here casually, the workers were so excited! Everyone hoped to offer Chairman Mao their best dish. Everyone felt that the only shortcoming was: we didn't know beforehand! If we had known earlier, we would have prepared the ingredients well, and that would have been really great! Now we can only do what we can with the materials available. Chef Li Hanqing especially felt apologetic about this. Everyone worked while looking at Chairman Mao from time to time. When everyone heard Chairman Mao introduce to the comrades from other provinces at the table, "You don't have this there, this is a Hubei flavor," all the staff of the restaurant smiled happily.
    Chairman Mao sat down at 8:10 PM. People were celebrating this happiest moment. Many people moved their seats to the places where it was easiest to see Chairman Mao. The children simply stopped eating, turned their bodies around, and stared at Chairman Mao with round eyes. Another child ran to Chairman Mao's seat to greet Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao put down his chopsticks, turned to shake hands with him, and stroked the top of his head. The child left happily. At this time, Chairman Mao asked the comrades beside him with concern, "Have the drivers eaten?"
    When everyone had finished eating, Chairman Mao looked at his watch and stood up from his seat. Everyone knew that Chairman Mao was about to leave, and they also stood up. At this time, Chairman Mao shook hands with the children and workers again, asking as he shook hands:
    "Are you a cooperative or a joint state-private enterprise?"
    "We are state-owned," the workers replied.
    The workers working in the kitchen had all come out at this time. Chairman Mao had already walked to the front, but seeing that some more workers were coming out from behind, he turned back and shook hands with everyone one by one. Many people hadn't had time to wash their hands! But Chairman Mao had already reached out his hand.
    On this night, the workers of Lao Tong Cheng were in an uproar all night. People discussed, talked, spread the word, and relived this happiest moment they had experienced. They also held a symposium. Master Wang Shoushan, who never spoke at meetings, also spoke on this day.
    "In the old society, no one looked up to us master chefs. Today, the leader of the country came to see us." This was everyone's deepest feeling.
    "Chairman Mao is so healthy!" This was what made everyone the happiest.
    "How can we respond to Chairman Mao's concern and commemorate this happiest moment?" This was the question that everyone asked themselves.
    Many people wrote down the diary of that day, and many people were so excited that they didn't want to eat or sleep.

### 毛主席到了老通成

    毛主席到了老通成
    做三鲜豆皮的大师傅曾延龄一谈到和毛主席握手的情况时，总爱激动地说：“我还没有来得及把手洗干净哩，毛主席就把手伸过来了。毛主席把我的手握得紧紧的，当时就像有一股热流通过全身一样，一身都热火起来了。我就想：毛主席呀，他老人家心里，真是不知道是怎样关心我们！”
    曾延龄是老通成做豆皮的第一把手。很久以来，他就有着这么一个愿望：“要是我呀！我也能去一去北京，见见毛主席，最好是能把自己亲手做的豆皮，让毛主席尝一尝，我这一生也就得到满足了。”有时候他这样想着想着，他相信自己这个愿望准能实现，但有时候想着想着，他又觉得自己这想法有些好笑。他万没有料到他这个带点幻想的诚实的愿望，居然不等到去北京，在武汉就实现了。
    事情是这样的。
    1958年4月3日，下午七点钟。
    花桥老通成餐馆里，顾客已经没有白天那么拥挤了，餐堂里还坐着二三桌人。三岁的王熙滨和他的四个哥哥姐姐，还有他爹他妈，一家子七口人，是其中最后来的，这时候正一边吃着卤菜，一边在谈论些什么，滨滨他妈刘燕如心里想着什么，还正在纳闷呢！
    忽然，外面响起了一阵汽车声。不一会，就进来了几个人，起先大家还以为大概是什么新来的顾客，只见头一个进来的却是省委书记王任重同志，他进门后，转身向后面的人表示了一下请进的手势，接着，一个天顶很宽、头发乌黑、身材魁梧、穿灰制服的人，迈着稳健的步子走了进来。这一下，大家都楞住了，这熟悉的面孔、身材举止，不正是毛主席吗？大家霍地都站了起来，呆呆地望着，也不知说什么好。正在这一刹那，还是孩子们最机伶，滨滨首先扯着大嗓子，伸出洁白的小手指着毛主席，高声喊：“毛主席！毛主席！”滨滨的哥姐们也就不约而同地一齐拥向毛主席的身边，五岁的女孩熙江贴近毛主席，用手牵着毛主席的衣角，问：
    “毛主席，你是不是从北京来的呀？”
    “是呀！”毛主席慈祥地回答她说。
    毛主席和孩子们一一握了手，抚摸着孩子们的头，滨滨他妈这时正激动得忘记了一切，看到毛主席直走到她桌前了，这才想起来，马上向前和毛主席握了手，问毛主席好。毛主席问了问她和她爱人在什么地方工作后，又环顾了一下四周，向大家挥手致意。又转身一条一条地看了看墙上贴的除四害和大跃进的标语，一边看，一边念。然后问站在旁边的经理万书明同志：
    “这是你们写的吗？”
    “是的。”万书明回答。
    “好，好，好。”毛主席说。
    毛主席又看了一下墙壁，满有兴趣地问：
    “这墙是什么东西做的？”
    “刨花板做的，很经济。”万书明说。
    毛主席听完介绍后，没有就坐，一直向厨房走去。一跨进厨房门，毛主席就挥手向大家招呼：“辛苦了！辛苦了！”
    厨房里的工人们，在这以前还不知道毛主席来了呢！头一个看到毛主席的，是做汤包的锺生楚师傅。他刚刚把包子捏好，装上笼，准备去盖盖子，毛主席就来到了他的面前。锺师傅怔住了，他看到毛主席那红光满面、神采奕奕的样子，心想毛主席真不像六十几岁的人，毛主席这样的健康，这是中国人民的幸福。他想说几句祝福的话，但是，一句也没有说出来，只是满面笑容地呆呆地凝视着毛主席。当毛主席指着案板上的包子问他：“这是什么包子？”他竟忘记了回答。直到毛主席第二次又问他：“这包子是谁做的？”这时，他才如梦初醒过来，说：“这是汤包，是我做的。”
    整个厨房都活跃起来，毛主席那慈祥的笑容，平易近人的举止，和蔼亲切的谈话，使大家原有的一点紧张，完全消融了。
    毛主席接着就问曾师傅：“你是做什么的呀？”
    曾师傅说：“我是做豆皮的。”
    曾师傅回答后心里想，该请毛主席吃点好的豆皮，就又对毛主席说：“我准备专门做点好的豆皮，请你老人家吃。”
    毛主席又亲切地看了一下曾师傅，说：“你太细心了。”
    曾师傅说：“总是愿您老人家健康啊！”
    毛主席继续向前走去，来到了炉灶面前，用手摸了一下灶面，看手指上没有灰尘，就称赞大家说：“这个炉灶很干净呀！”
    接着，毛主席又和做菜的李汉卿师傅和其他一些师傅谈了话。
    沿锅灶边走到宿舍门口的时候，毛主席又进去看了一下宿舍，看到宿舍里很整洁，毛主席说：“很好，很好。”
    和大家都见过面以后，毛主席跟同来的同志们说，今天就在这里吃饭吧。原来毛主席和其他几位同志都还没有吃晚饭呢！
    听说毛主席顺便在这里吃饭，工人们可兴奋啊！谁都希望把最拿手的东西献给毛主席。大家都感到美中不足的是：事前不知道呀！事前要早知道，一定把原料准备得好好的，那才拿手呢！现在只有看材料办了，做菜的李汉卿师傅对这点尤其感到抱歉。大家一面工作，一面把眼睛不时地望着毛主席。当大家听到毛主席向同桌的外省同志介绍说：“你们那里没有这，这是湖北的风味。”餐馆的全体工作人员都高兴地笑了。
    毛主席入座时，已经八点十分了，人们欢度着这最幸福的时刻。许多人把座位移到了最容易看见毛主席的地方。孩子们索性不吃东西了，把身子转过来，睁着圆圆的眼睛望着毛主席，又有一个小孩跑到毛主席座位前去问毛主席好。毛主席把碗筷放下来，侧过身子和他握了手，抚摸他的头顶。小孩高兴地走了。这时，毛主席又关心地问旁边的同志：“司机同志都吃饭了没有？”
    等大家都吃完了。毛主席看了看表，从座位上站起来。大家知道毛主席快要离开了，也都站了起来，这时毛主席又和孩子们、工人们去握手，一边握手，一边又问：
    “你们是合作社、还是公私合营？”
    “我们是国营。”工人们回答。
    在厨房里工作着的工人们这时都已经走了出来。毛主席本来已经走到前面了，看见后面又走出来一些工人，又回转身去和大家一个一个地都握了手，好些人都还没有来得及洗手呢！但是，毛主席已经把手伸过来了。
    就在这天夜晚，老通成的工人们，沸腾了一夜，人们议论着、交谈着、传诵着、重温着自己经历的这个最幸福的时刻，还开了座谈会，从来开会不发言的王寿山师傅这天也讲了话。
    “旧社会谁瞧得起我们这些大师傅，今天国家的领袖来看了我们。”这是大家最深刻的感受。
    “毛主席真健康啊！”这是使大家最高兴的事情。
    “用什么来回答毛主席的关心、纪念这个最幸福的时刻呢？”这是每个人给自己提出的问题。
    许多人写下了当天的日记，许多人兴奋、激动得不想吃饭，睡不着觉。
