Changes to the Vacant Lot
Our organization had many vacant lots, overgrown with weeds. Outside the fence was the agricultural cooperative's vegetable garden, green all year round. The cooperative members couldn't stand this situation, saying that there was a world of difference across the fence.

In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, the face of the motherland is changing with each passing day, and the appearance of this vacant lot has also changed. In order to beautify the environment and make full use of the land, we planted poplars and cypresses here this spring. Recently, the Provincial Communist Youth League Committee called on young people to use their spare time labor to accumulate funds to support the establishment of the "three stations" (tractor stations, power stations, and pumping stations), and everyone unanimously set their sights on this piece of land. Even though trees have been planted, crops can still be interplanted. In a few days, the vacant lot was completely plowed over. Fertilizer was applied again and again, applying ash fertilizer and then manure. Comrades who used to dislike the smell of fertilizer when planting vegetables didn't mind it anymore. Now various kinds of vegetables have been planted on the vacant lot, comparable to the agricultural cooperative.

    空地的变化
    我们机关内有许多空地，杂草丛生。篱笆外就是农业社的蔬菜地，四季长青。社员们对这种状况看不惯，说一篱之隔，差了千里。
    在大跃进的浪潮中，祖国的面貌日新月异，这块空地的面目也改变了。为了美化环境，充分利用土地，今春我们在这里种上了白杨和柏树。最近，团省委号召青年们用自己的业余劳动积累资金，支援三站（拖拉机站、发电站、抽水机站）的建立，大家又不约而同地看上了这块地。虽已栽树，还可间种作物。不几天，空地全部被挖翻了。肥料施了一次又一次，施了灰肥又放大粪。过去嫌种菜施肥有臭味的同志也不嫌了。现在空地上已种上各种菜类，可与农业社媲美了。
