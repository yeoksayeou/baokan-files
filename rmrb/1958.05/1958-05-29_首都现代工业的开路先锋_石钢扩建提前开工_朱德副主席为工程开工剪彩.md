Xinhua News Agency, 28th: Under the brilliant illumination of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the General Line for Socialist Construction, the expansion project of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant officially commenced today, two months ahead of schedule. The commencement of the expansion project marks the beginning of this plant's leap towards becoming a large-scale iron and steel complex and serves as a pioneering step in establishing a series of modern industrial bases in the capital. Upon completion of the expansion project in 1961, the plant will have an annual output of 1.3 million tons of steel and 1.9 million tons of pig iron.

Vice Chairman Zhu De attended today's commencement ceremony and cut the ribbon for the project's inauguration, bringing immense joy and inspiration to all the plant's employees.

Also attending the commencement ceremony were Vice Ministers of Metallurgical Industry Lu Dong and Xia Yun, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Mayor of Beijing Jia Tingsan, as well as representatives from various organizations, groups, factories, and mines in Beijing.

The expansion of this plant proves the correctness of the Party Central Committee's policy of decentralizing investment and the decision made by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry on this policy. This plant and the relevant design departments actively promoted this policy, transforming the original plan for expanding a medium-sized iron and steel plant into a large-scale iron and steel complex, with the planned annual steel output more than doubling, without increasing investment or significantly adding personnel.

Today, the construction site was covered with huge slogans from the employees supporting the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and implementing the General Line for Socialist Construction. On this site, the employees spent only two months basically completing the preparations before construction. In the past week, to celebrate the victorious conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the employees demonstrated the unique heroic spirit of the working class, exceeding their engineering quotas one after another. The Dong Yingcai team of the First Engineering Department overfulfilled its leap forward plan by 40%, and the excavating machine team of the Mechanical Power Workshop excavated an average of more than 40 cubic meters of earth per shift compared to the leap forward plan.

The construction site presented a scene of intense and joyful activity before the start of construction: the site was leveled, and roads were accessible. At the sintering site, the foundation earthwork of the main sintering plant building was nearing completion, and a 42-meter-high main plant building and a 120-meter-high chimney will be erected here. Obstacles are being cleared at the steelmaking and rolling mill sites. The old foundations of the blast furnaces and coke ovens at the ironmaking and coking sites have been reinforced. Throughout the construction site, temporary buildings were rarely seen because the veteran workers of the old plant vacated a large number of houses for the construction workers. This is a significant feature of this construction site. By carrying out the expansion in this way, the plant not only greatly accelerated the speed of expansion but also saved the country several million yuan of wealth.

The commencement ceremony was held at 3 p.m. More than two thousand basic construction workers, production workshop workers, and advanced producers entered the venue with their guarantee letters and leap forward targets.

Zhou Guanwu, director of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said in his speech that the recently concluded Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China greatly inspired all employees, and all employees are responding to the call of the conference with the practical action of starting the expansion project ahead of schedule. He said that the expansion of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant has received great care from the responsible comrades of the Party Central Committee and the constant guidance from the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, which has reduced many detours in the work. He also expressed his gratitude on behalf of all employees to the strong support from brother factories across the country.

Jia Tingsan, Standing Committee Member of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Mayor of Beijing, pointed out in his speech that the early expansion of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of the employees. He called on all employees to better implement the General Line for Socialist Construction, actively carry out technological and cultural revolutions, and carry out socialist competition with brother factories across the country.

### 首都现代工业的开路先锋  石钢扩建提前开工  朱德副主席为工程开工剪彩

    首都现代工业的开路先锋
    石钢扩建提前开工
    朱德副主席为工程开工剪彩
    新华社28日讯　在中共“八大”二次会议和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，石景山钢铁厂的扩建工程今天提前两个月正式开工。扩建工程的开工，是这个厂跃进到大型钢铁联合企业的一个开端，也是首都建立一系列现代化工业基地的开路先锋。到1961年扩建工程全部投入生产后，这个厂将年产一百三十万吨钢和一百九十万吨生铁。
    朱德副主席参加了今天的开工典礼，并为工程开工剪彩，这为全厂职工带来了极大的喜悦和鼓舞。
    参加开工典礼的还有冶金工业部副部长吕东、夏耘，中共北京市委常委、北京市副市长贾庭三和北京市各机关团体厂矿的代表。
    这个厂的扩建，证明了党中央投资下放方针和冶金部就这一方针作出的决定的正确性。这个厂和有关设计部门积极推行了这一方针，在投资不增，人员力求不加的前提下，使扩建中型钢铁厂的计划变为一个大型钢铁联合企业，钢的计划年产量较原计划增加一倍多。
    今天，扩建工地上贴满了职工们拥护中共“八大”二次会议决议和贯彻社会主义建设总路线的巨幅标语。在这片工地上，职工们仅仅用了两个月的时间，就基本上完成了施工前的准备工作。最近一周内，职工们为了庆祝中共“八大”二次会议的胜利闭幕，表现了工人阶级特有的英雄气概，纷纷突破工程定额。第一工程处董应才小组超额40％完成了跃进计划，机械动力车间的挖土机队每班比跃进计划平均多挖土四十多立方。
    工地上呈现出一片开工前的紧张愉快的情景：场地平整，道路通达。在烧结工地上，烧结主厂房的基础土方工程已接近完工，这里将要竖起高达四十二公尺的主厂房和一百二十公尺高的烟囱。炼钢轧钢工地上正在清除障碍物。炼铁炼焦工地上的高炉焦炉的旧基础已经加固。在整个工地上，由于老厂职工给建筑工人腾出了大量住房，临时性建筑物很少见到。这是这个工地上的一个重大的特点。这个厂这样进行扩建，不仅大大加快了扩建速度，还为国家节省了数百万元的财富。
    开工典礼在下午三时举行。两千多名基本建设的职工，生产车间的职工和先进生产者，带着自己的保证书和跃进指标进入会场。
    石景山钢铁厂厂长周冠五在会上讲话，他说，刚刚闭幕的中共“八大”二次会议给全体职工很大鼓舞，全体职工以扩建工程提前开工的实际行动，来响应大会的号召。他说石钢的扩建受到党中央负责同志的极大关怀和中共北京市委、冶金工业部的经常指示，使工作少走许多弯路，他并代表全体职工向全国各兄弟厂的大力支援表示感谢。
    中共北京市委常委、北京市副市长贾庭三在讲话中指出：石钢的提前扩建充分表现出了职工的积极性，他号召全体职工更好地执行社会主义建设总路线，积极开展技术革命和文化革命，并和全国各兄弟厂开展社会主义竞赛。（附图片）
