    The Tibetan Plateau herdsmen, who have battled the harsh wind and snow all winter, are now welcoming a new spring. Riding horses and carrying rifles, they drive herds of yaks, sheep, and goats to pastures near and far.

    Between the Himalayas, the Tanggula Mountains, and the Gangdise Mountains, around the highland inland lakes like Yamdrok Lake, Tengri Lake, and Qilin Lake, black yak-hair tents are scattered like stars. The herdsmen have finished shearing this year's first wool. Women are busy spinning wool yarn and weaving pulu (Tibetan wool fabric); men are stepping up the tanning of hides and sewing leather bags. The herdsmen's队伍annual caravan to transport lake salt from the salt lake area deep in the northern Tibetan grasslands is also ready to set off.

    Animal husbandry plays a major role in the economic life of the Tibetan people. Pastoral areas account for 80% of the region's total area, with approximately ten million head of livestock, producing large quantities of wool, hides, yak tails, ghee, and milk dregs annually. Most of the pastoral areas are distributed in the north and west of Tibet, and the herdsmen living there are called "Great Herdsmen." In particular, the "Changtang" grassland in northern Tibet, covering an area of 250,000 square kilometers, is vast, with gentle slopes and wide valleys. In the transition from spring to summer, the natural pasture is a lush green. Huge herds of cattle and sheep, numbering in the thousands, move slowly across the grasslands. Large numbers of wild birds, such as swans, geese, ruddy shelducks, and gray cranes, fly from the south to the inland lake shores to lay eggs and hatch their young. A large portion of the northernmost part of the Changtang grassland in northern Tibet is uninhabited and needs to be developed and utilized. There are various minerals here, as well as countless wild horses, yaks, blue sheep, antelopes, bears, otters, foxes, and other beasts.

    In southern and eastern Tibet, there are also many grasslands separated by high mountains, forests, and farmland, where livestock from agricultural areas are raised and grazed. The southern grasslands are surrounded by flowing springs, and the pasture is lush and beautiful. The purple flowers growing in the pasture make the milk production of dairy cows exceptionally abundant. The large sheep of Kangmazong, north of Mount Everest, weigh one or two hundred catties and look like small donkeys. The wool is of excellent quality and, according to animal husbandry experts, can be spun into 50-count fine yarn.

    In the seven years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the state has issued interest-free pastoral loans in many pastoral areas and purchased long-accumulated wool, leather, and other animal products and local specialties from pastoral areas at high prices. Veterinary epidemic prevention personnel travel back and forth on the grasslands year after year, eradicating various diseases. In 1954, more than 2,000 li of epidemic prevention zones were established in the eastern pastoral areas of the Tibetan Plateau. Trade teams and medical personnel also went deep into the pastoral areas to supply daily necessities and treat diseases for the herdsmen. Mobile film projection teams showed movies to the herdsmen. Many herdsmen hung portraits of Chairman Mao in their tents and posted pictures of the construction of the motherland cut from Tibetan picture magazines. A new dawn has begun to appear on the Tibetan grasslands. (Attached picture)

    在西藏草原上
    新华社记者　宗子度
    和严寒的风雪搏斗了一冬的西藏高原的牧民们，现在又迎接着新的春天。他们骑着马，背着火枪，把成群的牦牛、绵羊和山羊赶向远远近近的草场。
    在喜马拉雅山、唐古拉山和冈底斯山之间，在羊卓雍湖、腾格里海和奇林湖等高原内陆湖泊的周围，搭起了星罗棋布的黑色牛毛帐幕。牧民们已经剪完了今年的第一次羊毛。妇女们忙着搓羊毛线，编织氆氇；男人们加紧揉制皮张，缝制皮囊。一年一度前往藏北草原深处盐湖区驮运湖盐的牧民队伍也整装待发了。
    畜牧业生产在西藏人民经济生活中占着主要地位，牧区占全区总面积的80％，约有一千万头牲畜，每年出产大量的羊毛、皮张、牛尾、酥油、奶渣等畜产品。绝大部分牧区分布在西藏的北部和西部，居住在那里的牧民被称为“大牧民”。特别是藏北广达二十五万平方公里的“羌塘”草原，地势辽阔，坡平谷广，春夏之交，天然牧草一片碧绿。数以千百计的庞大牛羊群，在草原上缓缓移动。大批的野禽，如天鹅、大雁、红鸭、灰鹤等从南方飞来内陆湖滨，产卵孵雏。藏北“羌塘”草原最北部有一大半的土地荒无人烟，有待开发利用，这里有多种矿产，还有无数野生的马、牦牛、青羊、羚羊、熊、獭、狐狸等兽类。
    在西藏的南部和东部，也有许多被高山、森林和农田分割开来的草原，农业区的牲畜在这里饲养放牧。南方草原流泉萦绕，牧草丰美。丛生在牧草中的紫朵花，奶牛吃了奶量格外充足。珠穆朗玛峰北麓康巴宗的大绵羊体重一、二百斤，活像小毛驴。羊毛质地优良，经畜牧业专家鉴定，可纺五十支细纱。
    西藏和平解放七年来，国家在许多牧区发放了无利牧业贷款，并高价收购积压多年的羊毛、皮革等畜产品和牧区的土特产品。兽疫防治人员成年累月地奔驰在草原上，扑灭各种疫病。1954年在西藏高原东部牧区就曾建立了两千多里长的防疫地带。贸易小组、医务人员也深入到牧区供应生活日用品和为牧民治疗疾病。电影巡回放映队给牧民放映电影。很多牧民的帐幕里挂上了毛主席的画像，张贴着从藏文画刊上剪下来的关于祖国建设的图片。在西藏草原上开始出现了新生的曙光。（附图片）
