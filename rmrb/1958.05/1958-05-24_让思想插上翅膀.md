Let Thoughts Take Flight

People understand the world through practice and transform it. Many things that seem difficult can be accomplished as long as your thoughts take flight, you dare to think expansively, and you dare to practice boldly. Xue Lantian, a twenty-two-year-old youth from Tianjin, is one such person whose thoughts have taken flight. Tap water is not new in cities, but it is a major event in the countryside. A young farmer even wanted to build a waterworks, and without spending the state's money, but by the masses themselves. Isn't this "daydreaming"? However, it is a reality. With the support of the Party, Xue Lantian, through diligent work, finally built a homemade waterworks, enabling more than 1,600 farmers to drink the same tap water as in the city. This is a great revolution in rural water consumption.

We must never be superstitious about anything, and our thinking must not be rigid and inflexible. We must invigorate our fearless spirit of creation. In our liberated great country with a population of 600 million, as long as people's intelligence is fully utilized, high mountains will bow to us, and rivers will make way for us.

We must dare to think! Perhaps what we think of today cannot be done today, but it can be done tomorrow, and if it cannot be done tomorrow, it will surely be done in the future. When thinking is liberated, anything can be done and done well. Let each of us take flight like Xue Lantian!

    让思想插上翅膀
    人们在实践中认识世界，并且改造世界。许多看起来很难办到的事情，只要你的思想插上翅膀，敢于海阔天空地想，敢于大胆地实践，就可以办到。天津市一个二十二岁的青年薛蓝田，就是一个思想上插了翅膀的人。自来水，在城市并不新奇，然而，在农村却是一件大事。一个青年农民，竟想办自来水厂，而且不花国家的钱，由群众自己来办，这不是“痴人说梦”？然而，这是现实。薛蓝田在党的支持下，经过辛勤的劳动，终于建成了土造自来水厂，使一千六百多个农民也能喝到同城市一样的自来水。这是农村饮水的大革命。
    凡事决不可迷信，思想不可凝固不化。我们要振奋大无畏的创造精神。在我们这样一个解放了的具有六亿人口的大国，只要人们的聪明才智充分发挥出来，高山就会向我们低头，河水就会给我们让路。
    我们要敢想！也许我们今天想到的事，今天还不能做到，但是明天就可以做到，如果明天还不能做到，将来也一定能做到。思想解放了，什么事情都能办到、办好。让我们每一个人都像薛蓝田一样展翅高飞吧！
