　　Another Victory in the Advance into Outer Space
    The Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite is in the sky! This new satellite not only far exceeds the first and second satellites in weight and altitude into outer space, but also carries instruments that the previous two satellites did not. This shows that Soviet science and technology have made new developments and achievements.
    The first two Soviet satellites conducted scientific explorations of the upper atmosphere and outer space, and accumulated extremely extensive materials, making significant contributions to world science. Now, based on the achievements of the first two satellites, the third satellite will further conduct scientific exploration and extensive research on the upper atmosphere and outer space, thus bringing mankind's scientific research in this area into a new stage. This is another victory for mankind's advance into outer space, and another gospel for world scientific research. The Chinese people warmly congratulate the Soviet Union on this new achievement in science and technology.
    The launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite is clear evidence that the East Wind continues to prevail over the West Wind. The United States spent a great deal of effort to launch three small satellites, which were small in size and low in scientific value, and could not be compared with Soviet artificial satellites at all. Moreover, subsequent satellite launches failed.
    Since the Soviet Union launched its first artificial satellite and the Moscow meeting of communist and workers' parties of various countries, the world situation has further developed in a way that is favorable to socialism and unfavorable to capitalism. Of particular importance is the starkly contrasting economic situation in the two camps. The economies of the socialist countries have further achieved great development. The Soviet Union's industrial production in the first quarter of this year increased by 11% compared with the same period last year, and in China, from January to April this year, the total output value of industrial enterprises increased by 26% compared with the same period last year. Other socialist countries are also in the upsurge of socialist economic construction.
    On the other hand, the capitalist world is further declining. The economies of the capitalist world have generally fallen into stagnation and decline. In the United States, a serious cyclical economic crisis has broken out. From September last year to March this year, the industrial production in the United States decreased by 11.7%, and the downward trend is still developing. Some other major capitalist countries have also fallen into the whirlpool of economic crisis, such as Canada and Japan; some are about to experience economic crises, such as Britain, France, and West Germany; and the economies of Latin American countries have also fallen into extremely difficult situations due to the invasion of the American economic crisis. Not only that, but as the economic crisis develops, the contradictions between the imperialist countries are also intensifying, and the struggles of the people of various countries controlled and enslaved by the United States against American imperialism are also rising. The recent climax of the anti-imperialist patriotic struggle of the Lebanese people, and the strong demonstrations of the people of Latin American countries against the visit of US Vice President Nixon, are proof of this.
    In short, the future is bleak in the capitalist world, especially for the United States. This is in stark contrast to the thriving socialist world.
    The declaration of the communist and workers' parties of the socialist countries issued in Moscow last November pointed out: "In our era, the development of the world depends on the process and outcome of the competition between the two opposing social systems." Since the publication of this declaration, the continued upward development of socialism and the further decline of capitalism have made the outcome of the competition between the two social systems even more obvious. The launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite will make the people of all countries more convinced of the unparalleled superiority of socialism, and will further encourage the people of all countries to struggle for the cause of peace, democracy and socialism.

### 向宇宙空间进军的又一胜利

　　向宇宙空间进军的又一胜利
    苏联的第三个人造地球卫星上天了！这个新的卫星不仅在重量和进入外层空间的高度方面远远超过了第一和第二个卫星，而且还装载了前两个卫星没有装载过的仪器。这表明苏联科学技术又有了新的发展和成就。
    苏联的前两个卫星对大气高层和宇宙空间进行了科学的考察，并积累了极其广泛的材料，对世界科学作出了重大的贡献。现在，第三个卫星在前两个卫星所取得的成就的基础上，进一步进行对大气高层和宇宙空间的科学考察和广泛研究，从而将使人类这方面的科学研究进入一个新阶段。这是人类向宇宙空间进军的又一胜利，也是世界科学研究的又一福音。中国人民热烈祝贺苏联在科学技术方面的这一新成就。
    苏联第三个卫星的上天，是东风继续压倒西风的明证。美国费了九牛二虎之力才发射了三颗小卫星，体积又小，科学价值又低，根本不能和苏联的人造卫星相比，而且在以后又发射过卫星遭到了失败。
    自从苏联发射了第一个人造卫星以及各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议以来，世界形势又有了进一步的有利于社会主义而不利于资本主义的发展。特别重要的是两个阵营的经济情况发生截然相反的发展。社会主义阵营各国的经济进一步取得了大发展。苏联今年第一季度的工业生产比去年同期增长了11％，中国在今年1月到4月，工业企业的总产值比去年同期增长了26％，其他社会主义国家也都处在社会主义经济建设的跃进高潮中。
    反观资本主义世界则正在进一步衰退中，资本主义世界的经济已普遍陷入停滞和下降，在美国并爆发了严重的周期性经济危机。从去年9月到今年3月，美国的工业生产下降了11.7％，目前下降的趋势还在继续发展中。其他主要资本主义国家有的也已陷入经济危机的漩涡，如加拿大和日本；有的将要发生经济危机，如英国、法国和西德；拉丁美洲各国则由于美国经济危机的侵袭经济也陷于极端困难的境地。不仅这样，在经济危机发展的同时，帝国主义国家之间的矛盾也日益加剧，受美国控制和奴役的各国人民反对美国帝国主义的斗争也日益高涨。最近期间，黎巴嫩人民反帝爱国斗争的高潮，以及拉丁美洲各国人民反对美国副总统尼克松的访问的强大示威，就是证明。
    总之，在资本主义世界，特别是对美国来说，前景是一团漆黑。这与社会主义的欣欣向荣恰成了鲜明的对照。
    去年11月在莫斯科发表的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言指出：“在我们的时代里，世界的发展取决于两个对立的社会制度竞赛的进程和结果。”从这个宣言发表以来，社会主义的继续向上发展和资本主义的进一步衰退，已使两种社会制度竞赛的优胜劣败的情景更加显然了。苏联第三个卫星的上天，将使各国人民更加信服社会主义的无比优越性，并将进一步鼓舞各国人民为和平、民主和社会主义的事业而斗争。
