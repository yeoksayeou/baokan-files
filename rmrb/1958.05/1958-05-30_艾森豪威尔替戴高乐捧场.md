Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Washington dispatch: U.S. President Eisenhower openly expressed his fondness for De Gaulle on the 28th. He said at a press conference that he personally "liked" De Gaulle, and that he had "long-term friendly contact" with De Gaulle when he served as Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in Europe during the war. Eisenhower's statement of his friendship with De Gaulle at this time is considered a very clear indication that the United States is supporting De Gaulle's rise to power.

    艾森豪威尔替戴高乐捧场
    据新华社29日讯　华盛顿消息：美国总统艾森豪威尔28日公然表示他对戴高乐的好感。他在记者招待会上说，他个人是“喜欢”戴高乐的，他在战时担任欧洲盟军最高统帅时就曾经同戴高乐“有过长期的友好接触”。艾森豪威尔在目前时机这样申述他同戴高乐的友谊被认为是十分明白的表示：美国在支持戴高乐上台。
    艾森豪威尔在这一天还再一次表示美国要干涉黎巴嫩内政。他说，根据国会通过的“艾森豪威尔主义”他有权在中东采取“某些行动”。
