Our newspaper, Guangzhou, 8th dispatch (Reporters Yang Weiqun and Special Correspondent Yun Feng report): In recent years, Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has mobilized the people of the entire county to extensively and regularly carry out the work of utilizing waste materials. To a great extent, this has solved the difficulty of insufficient raw materials for industrial and agricultural production in the county. Through the purchase and processing of waste materials, it has also played a significant role in increasing the income of the masses and improving their lives.

Since the end of last year, Xinhui County's utilization of waste materials has achieved "three transformations" (turning the useless into useful, one use into multiple uses, dilapidated into brand new), "three -izations" (economizing on materials, economizing monetarily, beautification), and three "combinations" (combining with current production development, combining with the needs of the masses' lives, combining with the patriotic health movement), bringing a new leap forward to this work.

Xinhui County has proven with facts: waste materials have broad uses and unlimited potential. In recent months, the county's grain department has created and promoted the use of rice straw, bagasse, *Cytisus scoparius*, and clam shells to make 14 new types of feed, increasing the county's pig raising plan from the actual figure of 230,000 pigs last year to 500,000 pigs this year. Last year, the Xinhui Vegetable Oil Factory experimented with using tangerine peels, orange peels, *Litsea cubeba* peels, pine needles, eucalyptus leaves, and *Sapium sebiferum* seeds to make various industrial oils, creating more than 20,000 yuan of wealth for the country; this year, the output value is expected to reach 200,000 yuan. The Xinhui Winery has also begun to use lychee kernels, longan kernels, *Boehmeria nivea* dregs, *Imperata cylindrica* dregs, and *Smilax glabra* to make wine. If the county fully utilizes these waste materials to make wine, it can save 6 million catties of grain and increase the value by 2.6 million yuan each year. Lotus roots, kudzu roots, potato dregs, water chestnut dregs, rotten oranges, and wild taro are also being used to make maltose, soy sauce coloring, and white wine. *Livistona chinensis* leaf ends are woven into palm hats and palm baskets, which are lightweight and beautiful, popular with the masses, and also sold overseas. Waste banana tree bark is made into industrial hemp. Dead *Taxodium ascendens* roots are made into nautical lifebuoys. More than ten kinds of industrial raw materials have also been excavated from stones, sand, and mud in the mountains and fields. Many waste materials are repeatedly used: rice straw is used to steam wine and then to make cotton, and the remaining dregs are used to make paper; bagasse is used to steam wine and then to make paper. Many discarded products are processed and refurbished to improve their effectiveness: old newspapers are brushed with grey water mixed with pig blood and turned into art paper; rotten cotton batting is soaked, boiled, bleached, and fluffed into new cotton. There are also refurbished old clothes, refurbished old furniture, and so on. In terms of construction projects, many waste materials have also been utilized. Anyone who has been to Xinhui County will praise the county's municipal construction. Here, 345 large and small buildings, including the newly built People's Auditorium, People's Hospital, People's Park, swimming pool, children's playground, and kindergarten, have been built, and 86% of the building materials used are waste and old materials. Among them, the People's Auditorium, which can accommodate more than 3,000 people and has a balcony, did not use half a steel bar from the state, used very little cement, and cost only 46,000 yuan. Xinhui County's use of waste and old materials for municipal construction has saved the state nearly 830,000 yuan in building materials, and the buildings are also very strong and beautiful. The use of waste and old building materials is not limited to the county seat, but is also very common in the market towns and villages of each district.

The waste materials utilized in Xinhui County, some of which are acquired through commercial departments, amount to 186 kinds; this year, it will increase to 286 kinds. In recent years, more than 1.4 million dan of waste materials have been purchased. The purchase of these waste materials has provided raw materials for the state, and to a considerable extent, solved the difficulty of insufficient raw material supply in the county's production leap forward; at the same time, it has also increased the people's income by 2.11 million yuan.

The fundamental reason why Xinhui County can utilize waste materials on a large scale lies in the leadership of the Party committee. At the end of last year, in order to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the county's Congress of Party Representatives decided to fully utilize all waste materials. Subsequently, the County People's Congress called on the people of the entire county to take action to clean up and utilize waste materials, and established a county-wide Waste Utilization Working Committee. In the past few months, comprehensive stores for waste material processing and utilization have been opened in the market towns of various districts. Through the organization of small vendors and agricultural cooperatives, various waste materials have been purchased and concentrated, and efforts have been made to achieve local purchase, local processing, local sales, and local use. At the same time, in conjunction with cleaning and sanitation work, these stores often send people to villages to help clean up waste materials, decorate houses, and beautify homes. This approach is very popular with the masses. Therefore, the waste materials purchased in the first quarter of this year are close to the total purchase value of last year. Now, the Waste Utilization Committee has made a plan for waste utilization in 1958: the value of waste materials purchased throughout the year will increase from 510,000 yuan last year to 1.74 million yuan, and the total value of waste material utilization will reach 7.33 million yuan. Eight new and expanded processing plants will also be built.

The experience of Xinhui County shows that the key to promoting the poor method of waste utilization lies in opposing right-leaning conservatism and opposing waste, and carrying out a resolute struggle against the idea of only reaching out to the state for materials. When Luokeng District of Xinhui County was building water conservancy projects last spring, the supply of cement was tight. The District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party proposed to dig up clay and burn it into earthen cement. Right-leaning conservatives argued, "The Communist Party really thinks of everything! If earthen cement could be made, cement factories would have closed long ago." But as a result, earthen cement was burned and mixed with a small amount of cement for use on two large sluice gates, and the project quality was very good. But in the summer, the right-leaning evil wind rose again. Earthen cement was not selling from inventory, and some people advocated giving the product away. Due to this influence, the earthen cement factory buildings were damaged by wind and rain and no one cared, and the kilns also collapsed. Later, after the socialist education movement of the whole people's rectification, the understanding changed, and the production of earthen cement was restored and expanded, and this poor method was promoted throughout the county.

### 新会县的人们懂得运用辩证法  变大量废物为社会财富  无用变有用　一用变多用　破旧变崭新

    新会县的人们懂得运用辩证法
    变大量废物为社会财富
    无用变有用　一用变多用　破旧变崭新
    本报广州8日电　记者杨伟群、特约记者云风报道：广东省新会县近年来发动全县人民广泛地经常地开展利用废物的工作，在很大程度上解决了全县工农业生产原材料不足的困难，通过收购和加工利用废物，对于增加群众收入，改善群众生活，也起了很大作用。
    从去年年底开始，新会县利用废物还做到“三变”（无用变有用，一用变多用，破旧变崭新）、“三化”（节约用材化，经济化，美化）和三个“结合”（结合当前生产发展，结合群众生活需要，结合爱国卫生运动），使这项工作来了个新的跃进。
    新会县用事实证明：废物用途广阔，潜力无限。这个县的粮食部门近几个月来创造和推广用稻草、蔗渣、茨藤、蚬壳等制成十四种饲料新品种，使全县今年养猪的计划指标从去年养猪实绩二十三万头跃进到五十万头。新会植物油厂去年试用桔皮、橙皮、羌皮、松针、桉叶、乌桕子等制成各种工业用油，为国家创造了二万多元财富；今年产值要达到二十万元。新会酒厂也开始利用荔枝核、龙眼核、木茨渣、茨莨渣、黄狗头等制酒。如果全县充分利用这些废料来制酒，每年可节约粮食六百万斤、增值二百六十万元。藕尾、葛尾、马铃渣、荸荠渣、烂桔、野芋头等也被利用来制饴糖、酱色、白酒等。葵叶尾编织成葵帽、葵篮，轻巧美观，群众喜用，还远销国外。废蕉树皮制成工业用麻。死水松根制成航海救生圈。从山野上的石子、沙、泥中，也发掘出十多种工业原料。许多废物被反复利用：稻草蒸酒后再制棉花，剩渣又造成纸；蔗渣蒸酒后，又用来制纸。许多废品加工翻新后提高了效用：旧报纸刷上掺猪血料的灰水，变成美术纸；烂棉胎经过浸煮、漂白、弹松，变成新棉。还有旧衣翻新，旧家具翻新，等等。在建筑工程方面也有很多废物得到利用。到过新会县城的人，谁都赞赏这个县的市政建设。这里新建人民礼堂、人民医院、人民公园、游泳池、儿童游乐场、幼儿园等大小三百四十五座，采用的建筑材料中有86％是废旧材料。其中人民礼堂，可容三千多人，有楼座，但是没有用国家半根钢筋，也极少用水泥，造价只有四万六千元。新会县利用废旧材料进行市政建设，为国家节约建筑材料总值近八十三万多元，建筑物也很坚固美观。利用废旧建筑材料，不限于县城，各区的墟镇和村庄也很普遍。
    新会县的废物利用，通过商业部门收购得来的一部分就有一百八十六种；今年要增加到二百八十六种。几年来已经收购了废物一百四十多万担。收购起这些废物，为国家提供了原材料，在相当的程度上，解决了县内生产跃进中原材料供应不足的困难；同时还增加了人民的收入二百一十一万元。
    新会县的废物能够做到大规模利用，根本原因在于党委的领导。去年年底，为了适应工、农业生产大跃进的新形势，县的中共党代表大会决定要把所有废物充分利用起来。接着县人民代表大会号召全县人民人人动手清理和利用废物，并成立了全县的废物利用工作委员会。几个月来，各区的墟镇都开设了废物利用加工的综合商店，通过组织小商贩和农业社的力量把各种废物收购集中，尽量做到就地收购，就地加工，就地出售，就地使用。同时，结合清洁卫生工作，这些商店经常派人到村帮助清理废物，粉饰房屋，美化家庭。这样的做法很受群众欢迎。因此今年第一季度收购的废物，接近去年全年的收购总值。现在，废物利用委员会做出了1958年度废物利用的规划：全年收购废物价值要从去年的五十一万元增加到一百七十四万元，废物利用的总值要达到七百三十三万元。还要新建和扩建八个加工厂。
    新会县的经验说明：推行废物利用的穷办法，关键在于反右倾保守、反浪费，对只伸手向国家要物资的思想进行坚决的斗争。新会县罗坑区去春兴修水利，当时水泥供应紧张，中共区委会提出挖取粘土烧成土水泥。右倾保守的人议论说：“共产党真是无所不想！如果能做成土水泥，水泥工厂早该关门了。”但是结果烧出土水泥，混合少量水泥用在两座大型水闸上，工程质量很好。可是到了夏季，右倾歪风又起。土水泥库存销不出去，就有人主张把产品送掉，由于这种影响，烧土水泥的厂房被风雨吹坏没人理，烧窑也倒塌了。后来，经过全民整风的社会主义教育运动，认识有了转变，才恢复和扩大土水泥的生产，并且把这个穷办法在全县范围内推广起来。（附图表）
