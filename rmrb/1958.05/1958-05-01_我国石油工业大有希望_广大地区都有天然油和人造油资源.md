    China's Petroleum Industry Holds Great Promise
    Vast Areas Have Natural and Artificial Oil Resources
    (Reported by this newspaper) The good news from petroleum exploration keeps pouring in.
    Following the gushing of large quantities of crude oil from the Nanchong, Longnusi, and Penglaizhen structures in central Sichuan, test wells have also yielded crude oil in the Guang'an structure east of Nanchong. Furthermore, crude oil has been overflowing during drilling in the Yingshan structure east of Nanchong. These developments further demonstrate the extensive distribution of petroleum in the central Sichuan area.
    The oil-bearing area of the Karamay oil region is also undergoing new expansion. The oil region's area has increased several times compared to what was explored and confirmed last year. Several new structures newly drilled in the Qaidam Basin this year have also shown good oil and gas indications. Employees of the Yumen Oil Mine are actively preparing to advance into the Turpan Basin. This region is ten times larger than the Jiuquan Basin and has superior geological conditions, making the prospects for finding new oil fields very high.
    In addition, geological personnel from the Ministry of Geology and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry have also discovered many areas with promising oil prospects during geological surveys. In Guizhou Province, which is adjacent to Sichuan, and in parts of Guangxi and Yunnan, over one hundred potentially oil-bearing structures have been discovered through preliminary surveys, with even more oil seepages than in Sichuan. Within the vast area of more than 200,000 square kilometers of the Songliao Plain, the industrial base center of the Northeast, there are formations suitable for petroleum accumulation everywhere, and latent underground structures are constantly being discovered. Recently, survey personnel from the Ministry of Geology encountered two oil layers for the first time in a borehole on the bank of the Songhua River. Oil and gas shows are also particularly strong in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the Subei Plain. Last winter and this spring, many farmers near Funing encountered dozens of places where crude oil gushed out of the silt like spring water while digging ditches and canals.
    According to geological surveys, over a quarter of China's 9.6 million square kilometers of land consists of sedimentary rock development areas with potential oil prospects. Although only over one million square kilometers have been surveyed so far, more than five hundred oil-bearing structures have already been discovered.
    In addition to natural petroleum, China also has extremely abundant artificial petroleum resources. According to geological surveys in twenty-one provinces and autonomous regions, 180 oil shale mines have been found. Coal deposits are even more abundant, with 80% of the country's more than 2,000 counties having coal, and many types of coal can be used to produce oil. In particular, the recent discovery of large amounts of lignite mines in Shanxi, Guangxi, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other places, with oil content ranging from 10% to 20%, provides very favorable conditions for the large-scale development of coal-to-oil production in various regions.

### 我国石油工业大有希望  广大地区都有天然油和人造油资源

    我国石油工业大有希望
    广大地区都有天然油和人造油资源
    本报讯　石油勘探的捷报不断传来。
    继四川中部的南充、龙女寺、蓬莱镇三个构造喷出大量原油后，在南充以东的广安构造上，也已有探井喷出原油；在南充东部的营山构造，钻井过程中也有原油溢出。这些情况都进一步证明，川中地区的石油分布是很广的。
    克拉玛依油区的含油面积也有新的扩展。油区的面积比去年探明的增加了好几倍。柴达木盆地今年新开钻的几个新构造，也都见到了很好的油气显示。玉门油矿的职工正在积极准备向吐鲁番盆地进发。这个地区比酒泉盆地大十倍，地质条件优越，找到新油田的希望很大。
    此外，地质部和石油工业部的地质人员在地质调查中，也发现了很多有含油远景的地区。和四川相邻的贵州省和广西、云南的部分地区，经普查发现的可能储油的构造已有一百多个，油苗比四川还要多。在东北工业基地中心的松辽平原二十多万平方公里的广阔范围内，到处都有适合于石油储集的地层分布，并且还不断发现潜伏的地下构造。最近地质部的普查人员在松花江畔的一个钻孔中，已经第一次遇到两个油层。在长江下游和苏北平原，油气苗的显示也特别旺盛。去冬今春阜宁附近许多农民在挖沟开渠时，就有几十个地方像泉水一样的从淤泥中喷出了原油。
    根据地质调查，我国九百多万平方公里的国土内，有四分之一以上是可能有含油远景的沉积岩发育地区。目前虽然只普查了一百多万平方公里，发现的储油构造已有五百多个。
    除了天然石油，我国人造石油的资源也极丰富。根据二十一个省和自治区地质调查的结果，就找到了一百八十个油母页岩矿。煤的矿藏更多，全国二千多个县80％都有煤，而且很多煤种都能炼油。特别是最近山西、广西、黑龙江、内蒙古等地发现大量褐煤矿，含油率都在10％到20％之间，为各地大量发展煤炼油提供了非常有利的条件。（附图片）
