Wheat is Not a Low-Yield Crop
Shandong Provincial Party Committee Leader Discusses Key to Next Year's Wheat Harvest

(Our dispatch from Jinan, May 26th, by reporter Lin Lin) A responsible member of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, who recently returned from presiding over an on-site wheat conference in Huang County, spoke to our reporter about several key issues that must be resolved to strive for a bumper wheat harvest next year.

Is wheat a low-yield crop or a high-yield crop?

The responsible member said that this is a problem that has not been resolved in Shandong for a long time. In the past, many people said that wheat was a low-yield crop and always reduced its planting area. This time, the first secretaries of the county party committees not only saw the typical example of over 4,000 mu of wheat in the Houlu Agricultural Cooperative in Ye County, all with strong leaves, large ears, and stalks reaching the chest, with an average yield of over 500 jin per mu; they also saw the typical example of 470,000 mu of wheat in Huang County (accounting for 67% of the total cultivated land area), all growing well. If there are no major disasters in the later stages, this county has a great hope of achieving an average yield of 330 jin per mu. Among these wheat fields, there are over 150,000 mu of first-class seedlings, which can yield 500 to 600 jin per mu; and within that, there are over 13,000 mu, which are expected to yield 700 to 1,000 jin per mu. These vivid facts prove that wheat can also achieve high yields. It provides a vivid example and lays a reliable ideological foundation for us to expand the wheat planting area and increase the yield per unit area this autumn. This is a remarkable event in Shandong. The provincial plan for wheat planting this autumn is to expand from 60 million mu last autumn to 80 million mu. If all of this is calculated at a yield of 300 jin per mu, it can produce 24 billion jin of wheat. This figure is only slightly less than the total grain output of the province in 1957, which suffered a major disaster.

How much seed should be retained, and what kind of seed should be retained?

This is also a major struggle. In the past, the provincial party committee proposed that the amount of seed retained per mu should reach 20 to 30 jin, with an average of 25 jin; however, many cadres did not understand this call. This time, many comrades personally saw the high-yield wheat in many cooperatives in Huang County and Ye County and realized that to achieve a yield of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, at least 30 jin of seed must be retained. At the same time, attention should be paid to regularly selecting and cultivating high-quality varieties suitable for local growth. The large-area high-yield wheat in Huang County and Ye County are all improved varieties that they have cultivated through multiple experiments.

Deep plowing or shallow plowing?

This also involves struggle. In many places in Shandong, the original cultivated land was only 3 to 5 inches deep, and in a few places, there was no plowing at all, and the highest was only 7 inches. The provincial party committee originally proposed that the minimum plowing depth should be 8 inches, but many people thought that they would not be able to cope with the busy farm work or that deep plowing would require reducing the planting area. This time, many people saw that wheat planting in the Houlu Agricultural Cooperative in Ye County accounted for 80% of the total cultivated land area, and even the shallowest plowing reached 7 inches. This proves that deep plowing is the key to increasing production, and land that has been deeply plowed can generally increase production by about 100 jin per mu.

Dense planting or sparse planting?

There are ideological issues and technical issues here. In the past, many people believed that "sparse wheat grows large ears" or that "more seeds will cause wheat to lodge." This time, people saw that the 3.75 mu of high-yield wheat in the Hongxing Cooperative in Huang County is expected to produce 1,300 jin per mu, and they sowed 30 jin per mu. Because they carried out scientific management, the wheat not only grew vigorously but also did not lodge. This concrete fact broke the conservative thinking of many people. The problem of seed retention has been solved. Can all of them be planted? Pre-training technicians and plow operators can play a decisive role. One of the reasons why wheat grows particularly well in Huang County and Ye County is that they have done this work. The plow operator is especially the key to determining the depth, sufficiency, and lack of wheat seeds. The best sowing tool is of course a ten-row seeder pulled by a tractor or animal power for cross-sowing; using an ordinary plow modified into a dense planting plow to implement wide-width dense planting can also achieve the same effect.

Wheat Management Experience

The responsible member particularly praised the complete set of wheat field management experience created by the Houlu Agricultural Cooperative in Ye County, led by national agricultural labor model Xu Jianchun. 1. Check seedlings and replant seedlings to ensure full and vigorous seedlings. After sowing last autumn, they checked every plot and ridge for missing seedlings more than half a foot, and replanted them as they checked. Some were transplanted after "Minor Snow". 2. Apply fertilizer rationally in stages. In addition to applying 3,500 jin of base fertilizer per mu, they also applied fertilizer in stages. The first time to apply winter fertilizer, an average of 5,000 jin of soil fertilizer per mu (including other fertilizers); the second time was before the greening, they also applied dry ash and "upgrading fertilizer" and foliar fertilizer in a timely manner according to the wheat growth. 3. Water in a timely and appropriate amount. In addition to applying sufficient base water at sowing, they mastered the knack of watering: "The first and second watering should be early, the third watering should be late, and the fourth and fifth watering should depend on the weather." The freezing water should be completed between the Beginning of Winter and Minor Snow; the greening water should be completed before the Awakening of Insects; the jointing water should be watered later to slow down the jointing of wheat and increase its resistance to lodging; the booting water should be watered around the Beginning of Summer; the grain-filling water should be determined according to the weather. Generally, watering is not done on windy and cloudy days to prevent lodging and disease. They also appropriately increased or decreased the number of watering according to the soil and wheat seedlings. 4. Press in time to prevent moisture evaporation; 5. After the wheat turns green, generally remove wheat bluegrass twice, and carry out pest control at the same time. 6. In addition to continuing watering in the later stage of management, the main thing is to prevent wheat lodging and control diseases and insect pests.

The Key to Striving for a Greater Wheat Harvest Next Year

The responsible member finally pointed out that the key to achieving a greater wheat harvest next year lies in grasping early, grasping well, and constantly solving ideological problems. Leaders at all levels must resolutely lead the masses to operate on the ground and engage in production; oppose standing by and "shouting production." It is necessary to learn from the experience of strengthening wheat field management in many excellent agricultural cooperatives in Huang County, learn from the experience of "planting the land like a vegetable garden and operating like embroidery" in the Pioneer Agricultural Cooperative in Ye County, and learn from many advanced experiences in the country, but the important thing is to create experiences suitable for the specific conditions of the region. It is necessary to grasp one link after another, and not allow any slackening. And striving for a complete victory in this year's summer harvest is an important ideological and material foundation for striving for a bumper wheat harvest next year. In addition to requiring various places to hold on-site meetings in a planned way and organize cadres at all levels to visit and study in wheat-producing areas, the provincial party committee will issue special instructions on winter and spring operations for wheat and other crops; a special booklet will be compiled and published on the typical examples of large-area high-yield wheat and their systematic management of wheat fields, which will be used as textbooks in local folk schools, agricultural middle schools, and agricultural technical schools for extensive teaching.

### 小麦不是低产作物  山东省委负责人谈明年小麦丰收的关键

    小麦不是低产作物
    山东省委负责人谈明年小麦丰收的关键
    本报济南26日电　记者林麟报道：最近从黄县主持小麦现场会议归来的中共山东省委负责人，向本报记者谈了为争取明年小麦丰收，必须解决的几个关键性问题。
    小麦是低产作物，
    还是高产作物？
    负责人说，这是山东长期没有解决的一个问题。过去，不少人说小麦是低产作物，总是压缩它的播种面积。这次，各县的县委第一书记不仅看到掖县后吕农业社四千多亩小麦全都是叶壮穗大，秸高齐胸，平均亩产约五百斤以上的典型；还看到黄县四十七万亩小麦（占总耕地面积的67％）全部生长良好的典型。这个县的小麦如后期无特大灾害，实现平均亩产三百三十斤是大有希望的。在这些小麦中有一类苗十五万多亩，可以亩产五百到六百斤；内有一万三千多亩，预计可以亩产七百到一千斤。这些生动的事实，证明小麦同样可以高产，它为今秋我们扩大小麦播种面积和提高单位面积产量，提供了生动的榜样，奠定了可靠的思想基础。这在山东是一件了不起的大事。山东全省今秋小麦播种计划拟由去秋的六千万亩扩大到八千万亩，如果全部按亩产三百斤计算，就可以产小麦二百四十亿斤。这个数字仅比受特大灾害的1957年全年全省粮食总产量仅少十多亿斤。
    留多少种，留什么种？
    这也是一场大斗争。过去，省委曾提出每亩留种应达到二十到三十斤，平均应达到二十五斤；但是，这一号召很多干部思想不通。这次许多同志亲眼看到黄县和掖县许多社丰产小麦，认识到：要亩产千斤麦，必须留足三十斤种。同时要注意经常挑选和培植适合当地生长的优良品种。黄县和掖县大面积丰产的小麦，都是他们经过多次实验培植的良种。
    深耕，还是浅耕？
    这也同样存在斗争。山东许多地方原来耕地仅三寸到五寸，少数地方还有不耕的，最高的也仅达到七寸。省委原来提出最低要耕到八寸深，许多人认为农活忙不过来，或者认为要深耕就要压缩播种面积。这次，许多人看到掖县后吕农业社小麦播种占耕地总面积的80％，而且最浅的耕到七寸。证明深翻深刨是增产的关键，一般经过深翻深刨的地每亩可增产一百斤左右。
    密植，还是稀植？
    这里面有思想问题，也有技术问题。过去许多人认为：“稀麦长大穗”，或者认为“种子多了小麦要倒伏”。这次，人们看到黄县红星社的三亩七分五厘地的丰产小麦，每亩预计可产一千三百斤，他们每亩即播种三十斤。由于他们进行科学的管理，小麦不但长得茂盛，而且没有倒伏。这一具体事实，打破了许多人的保守思想。留种问题解决了。是否都能种下去？事先训练好技术员和扶耧手就可以起决定的作用。黄县和掖县的小麦所以长得特别好的原因之一，就是他们做了这项工作。扶耧手尤其是决定小麦种深、种浅、种足、种缺的关键。最好的播种工具固然是用拖拉机或畜力牵引的十行播种机交叉播种；用普通耧子改成密植耧实行宽幅密植，也可以收到同样效果。
    小麦管理经验
    负责人特别推崇全国农业劳动模范徐建春领导的掖县后吕农业社创造的一套完整的麦田管理的经验。一、查苗补苗，保证苗全苗旺。去秋播种后，他们对半尺以上的缺苗，块块垅垅检查，随查随补，有的是在“小雪”以后移栽。二、分期合理追肥。每亩除施基肥三千五百斤以外，他们又分期追施肥料。第一次追冬肥，平均每亩土肥五千斤（其他肥料折合在内）；第二次是返青以前，他们还根据小麦生长好坏，适时追干灰、追“提级肥”和根外追肥。三、适时适量浇水。他们除播种时上足基水外，对浇水掌握“一、二水早，三水迟，四水、五水看天气”的窍门。封冻水在立冬小雪之间浇完；返青水在惊蛰前浇完；拔节水晚一点浇，使小麦拔节慢，增加抗倒伏的能力；孕穗水是立夏前后浇；灌浆水根据天气确定，刮风和阴天一般不浇，以防倒伏和发生疸病。他们还根据土壤和麦苗好坏适当增减浇水次数。四、及时划压，防止水分蒸发；五、小麦返青后，普遍拔除麦蒿两次，同时进行防虫害工作。六、后期管理，除继续浇水外，主要是防止小麦倒伏和防治病虫害。
    争取明年小麦
    更大丰收的关键
    负责人最后指出，要使明年小麦取得更大丰收，关键在于抓早、抓好和不断解决思想问题。各级领导必须坚决带领群众实地操作，搞生产；反对站在旁边“叫生产”。要学习黄县许多优秀的农业社加强麦田管理的经验，学习掖县先锋农业社“种地如菜园，操作如绣花”的经验，学习全国许多先进的经验，但重要的还在于创造适合本地区具体条件的经验。要一个环节接着一个环节抓，一刻也不允许松劲。而争取今年夏收全胜，又是争取明年小麦大丰收的重要的思想和物质基础。省委当前除要求各地有计划地召开现场会议，组织各级干部到小麦丰产地区参观学习外；对小麦等各种作物的冬作、春作要求，省委将发出专门指示；对一些小麦大面积丰产的典型及他们系统的管理麦田的经验即将编成专册出版，要各地民校、农业中学、农业技术学校当作教科书，广泛教学。（附图片）
