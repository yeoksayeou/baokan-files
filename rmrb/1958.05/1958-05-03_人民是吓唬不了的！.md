The People Cannot Be Intimidated!
By a Commentator of this Newspaper

The United States is a paper tiger; this has long been exposed by the Chinese people. In this situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, the United States has even less "prestige" to flaunt. However, this disadvantageous position is too unfavorable for the United States to maintain its position in Asia. Therefore, the United States still wants to boost its false prestige and act like a fat man by slapping his face until it swells. Today's news says that on May 2nd, the United States "secretly" tested the launch of a "Matador" missile in Taiwan. On May 1st, it also conducted an exercise with atomic cannons south of the Korean armistice line. At the same time, the joint fleet of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization also sailed to the South China Sea from May 1st to conduct a two-week exercise. These tricks are nothing more than to intimidate people, and at the same time, to cheer up its running dogs Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and even the rebels in Indonesia who are about to fail completely, and to show off the remaining power of the master. Of course, those human scum like Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee will inevitably dance with joy when they see that their master still has these tricks. However, for the Chinese people, the Korean people, and even the Indonesian people, the United States' tricks are not worth much. No matter how terrible the aggressors disguise themselves, the people have never been afraid of the aggressors! Isn't that so? The United States launched the Korean War, but was defeated by the Chinese and Korean people, and had to abandon its ambition to occupy the entire Korean Peninsula and invade New China, and cease fire at the 38th parallel; the Indonesian people knew from the first day that Hussein, Sjafruddin, and other national traitors rebelled that their backstage supporter was the United States, but the Indonesian people were not afraid of anything, and defeated the rebel group with resolute military action. Therefore, now, these kinds of exercises here and there by the United States cannot intimidate anyone. Moreover, to put it bluntly, the so-called "advanced" weapons that the United States is showing to its servants are already outdated goods.

We utterly despise the atomic blackmail policy of U.S. imperialism, but we cannot but express our solemn protest against this open provocation by the United States. All peace-loving people in the world can understand from these baring-teeth-and-brandishing-claws activities of the United States: the world will not have peace for a day as long as the U.S. war maniacs do not change their bellicose policy; the United States occupies our territory of Taiwan and refuses to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, just to occupy these advanced military bases and pose a war threat to the Chinese people, the Korean people, and the Asian people. We must expose the warmongering activities of the United States and stop its criminal acts of creating tension!

    人民是吓唬不了的！
    本报评论员
    美国是个纸老虎，这是早已被中国人民所戳穿了的。在这东风压倒西风的情势下，美国更是没有什么“威风”可抖了。可是，这一种劣势地位，对于美国维系它在亚洲的地位来说，太不妙了，因之，美国还想鼓一鼓虚气，打肿脸充充胖子。今天的消息说，2日美国在台湾“秘密”试验了“斗牛士式”导弹的发射，1日还在朝鲜停战线南侧，演习了原子大炮，同时，东南亚组织的联合舰队，也从1日开始，驶往中国南海举行为期两周的演习。这些把戏，无非是为的吓唬吓唬人，同时，又为它的走狗蒋介石、李承晚，以至行将全部失败的印度尼西亚的叛乱分子们，打打泄了的气，摆摆主子的余威。当然，那些蒋介石、李承晚之类的人民渣滓，看到他们的主子还有这两手，免不了手舞足蹈一番。但是，对于中国人民、朝鲜人民，以至印度尼西亚人民来说，美国的把戏，却值不了几文钱。不管侵略者把自己扮成多么可怕的样子，人民是从来不怕侵略者的！不是吗？美国发动侵朝战争，就被中朝人民所打败，不得不收起霸占全朝鲜，进窥新中国的野心，停战三八线；印度尼西亚人民，从侯赛尼、沙弗鲁丁等民族败类叛乱的第一天开始，就知道他们的后台是美国，可是，印度尼西亚人民也并没有害怕什么，以坚决的军事行动，击败了叛乱集团。因之，现在，美国在这里那里的这种那种演习，是吓不倒人的。何况，拆穿了说，美国表演给他的奴仆们看的所谓“先进”武器，早已是过了时的货色。
    我们十分鄙视美帝国主义这种原子讹诈政策，但是，我们对于美国这种公开的挑衅，不能不表示严正的抗议。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，从美国这些张牙舞爪的活动里，能够懂得：美国战争狂人一天不改变好战政策，世界就一天不得安宁；美国霸占了我国领土台湾，拒绝从南朝鲜撤退美军，就是为的占有这些前进的军事基地，对中国人民、朝鲜人民、亚洲人民进行战争的威胁。我们必须揭穿美国的好战活动，制止美国制造紧张局势的罪恶勾当！
