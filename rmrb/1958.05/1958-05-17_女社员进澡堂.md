    Women Commune Members Enter the Bathhouse

    (Our report) The bathhouse of the Feiguang First Commune in Anhui has also taken on a new look in the patriotic health campaign to eliminate the four pests. Many women commune members have entered the bathhouse for the first time ever to take a bath. Now, the bathhouse is very crowded and almost always full.

    In the past, the women here never had the habit of bathing. At the beginning of this year, the commune stipulated that each member should take a bath every half month, and specifically stipulated the bathing dates for male and female commune members. However, when it was the women's turn to bathe, no one entered the bathhouse. The commune leaders then sent more than a dozen female activists to mobilize in various villages to dispel their concerns about being embarrassed, and encouraged the female captains of the production teams and the female cadres sent to work in the commune to take the lead. In order to encourage female commune members to enter the bathhouse, the commune also implemented preferential measures for buying bath tickets. Now, many female commune members have developed the habit of bathing and praise it, saying: "The cooperative has done a good thing for us women!"

    女社员进澡堂
    本报讯　安徽淝光一社的澡堂，在除四害讲卫生运动中，也出现了前所未有的新气象。许多女社员破天荒地进澡堂洗澡了。现在，澡堂十分拥挤，差不多天天满座。
    过去，这里的妇女从来没有洗澡的习惯。今年年初，社里规定每个社员要半月洗一次澡，并具体规定了男社员和女社员洗澡的日期。但是，轮到女社员洗澡的日子，仍然没有人进澡堂。社领导上便派出十余位妇女积极分子到各村动员，解除她们怕丢丑的思想顾虑，又鼓励生产队女队长和下放到社生产的女干部起带头作用。为了鼓励女社员进澡堂洗澡，社里还实行了买澡票的优待办法。现在，许多女社员已养成了洗澡习惯，都称赞说：“合作社为俺们妇女办了件好事！”
