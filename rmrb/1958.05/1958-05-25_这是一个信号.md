This is a Signal
By a commentator of this newspaper

    According to Western news agencies, on the morning of May 22, the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, McClintock, visited the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Malik. On the same evening, the Lebanese authorities submitted a so-called "accusation" to the Security Council, insisting that the United Arab Republic had "interfered" in Lebanon's internal affairs. Immediately afterwards, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department expressed support for Lebanon's "accusation." Is this duet by the United States and the Lebanese authorities a coincidence? It is very clear that Lebanon's so-called "accusation" was instigated by the United States.
    The reason the United States wants the Lebanese authorities to take this action is to create an excuse for it to further interfere in the Lebanese situation. As early as May 15, Dulles had already laid a foreshadowing, saying that as long as Lebanon accused a certain foreign country of "large-scale interference" to the Security Council, the United States could "send armed forces to land in Lebanon."
    Therefore, the Lebanese authorities' so-called "accusation" is actually a signal that the United States is preparing to provoke the Lebanese people.
    However, this excuse of the United States is fundamentally untenable. On May 23, the Lebanese opposition parties issued a joint statement, exposing the conspiracy of the United States in creating this excuse. They also refuted the argument that the Lebanese people's uprising was the result of "interference" by the United Arab Republic. The fact that the Lebanese people rose up to oppose U.S. imperialism and its agents, and to oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in order to defend their national sovereignty and national interests, cannot be distorted by anyone.
    So who exactly interfered in Lebanon's internal affairs? Who exactly should be accused? It is precisely the United States and its followers who instigated the Lebanese authorities to submit the "accusation" to the Security Council. Since the Lebanese people launched a patriotic struggle against imperialism, the U.S. Sixth Fleet has been deployed in the waters near Lebanon for so-called "exercises." U.S. transport aircraft have flown to West Germany, threatening to send troops to Lebanon, and transporting tanks from West Germany to supply the Lebanese authorities to suppress the people. U.S. officers disguised as "civilians" are directing the Lebanese government forces to attack the insurgents. Aircraft piloted by Americans are directly involved in the Lebanese government's suppression activities. At the same time, the United States and Britain are planning to take "joint action" against Lebanon, using Cyprus as a base. Under the direction of the United States, a group of Jordanian troops have even gone to Beirut to act as accomplices in the massacre of the Lebanese people. All these interferences have been protested by Lebanese patriotic parties and the broad masses of the people, and condemned by world public opinion. Isn't this a fact?
    The U.S.'s interference activities and provocative conspiracies have not frightened the heroic Lebanese people. After more than two weeks of struggle, the momentum of the Lebanese uprising has been expanding, and they have already controlled large areas outside Beirut. The Lebanese people are not isolated. They have received the support of the vast number of peace-loving people in the world. The Soviet people have stated that they cannot ignore the imperialists' adventurous plans in the Middle East. Therefore, no matter what excuse the United States makes, any interference in the Lebanese situation is illegal and will inevitably be severely打击 (dǎjī - strike, attack, crack down) by the Lebanese people and all peace-loving people.

    这是一个信号

    据西方通讯社报道，5月22日上午，美国驻黎巴嫩大使麦克林托克访问了黎巴嫩外长马利克。同一天晚上，黎巴嫩当局向安全理事会提出所谓“控诉”，硬说阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”了黎巴嫩的内政。接着美国国务院的发言人就表示支持黎巴嫩的“控诉”。美国和黎巴嫩当局这样一唱一和，难道是偶然的吗？非常明显，黎巴嫩的所谓“控诉”，是受美国指使的。
    美国所以要黎巴嫩当局采取这个行动，是为了替它进一步干涉黎巴嫩局势制造借口。早在5月15日，杜勒斯已经作了个伏笔，他曾说过，只要黎巴嫩向安全理事会控诉某个外国“大规模干涉”，美国便可以“派武装部队到黎巴嫩登陆”。
    因此，黎巴嫩当局的所谓“控诉”，实际上就是美国准备向黎巴嫩人民挑衅的一个信号。
    可是，美国的这个借口是根本站不住脚的。5月23日，黎巴嫩反对党派发表联合声明，揭穿了美国制造这种借口的阴谋所在。他们并且驳斥了把黎巴嫩人民的起义说成是阿拉伯联合共和国“干涉”的论调。黎巴嫩人民为了保卫他们的国家主权和民族利益，才起来反对美帝国主义和它的代理人，反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，这个事实是任何人也歪曲不了的。
    那么到底是谁干涉了黎巴嫩内政？到底是谁应该受到控诉呢？恰恰就是策动黎巴嫩当局向安理会提出“控诉”的美国及其追随者。自从黎巴嫩人民发起反对帝国主义的爱国斗争以后，美国第六舰队就布阵黎巴嫩附近海面，进行所谓“演习”。美国大队运输飞机飞往西德，扬言将派兵前往黎巴嫩，并从西德调运坦克供给黎巴嫩当局镇压人民。美国军官化装成“平民”，指挥黎巴嫩政府军队进攻起义者。美国人驾驶的飞机直接参与了黎巴嫩政府的镇压活动。同时，美国与英国正策划以塞浦路斯为基地，对黎巴嫩采取“联合行动”。在美国的指使下，有一批约旦军队竟开往贝鲁特充当屠杀黎巴嫩人民的帮凶。所有这些干涉，已经遭到黎巴嫩爱国党派和广大人民的抗议以及世界舆论的谴责，难道这不是事实吗？
    美国的干涉活动和挑衅阴谋，并没吓倒英勇的黎巴嫩人民。经过两个多星期的斗争，黎巴嫩起义人民的声势日益扩大，他们已经控制了贝鲁特以外的大片地区。黎巴嫩人民不是孤立的。他们得到了世界上广大爱好和平人民的支持。苏联人民曾经表示，他们对于帝国主义在中近东的冒险计划不能置之不理。因此，不论美国制造什么借口，它对黎巴嫩局势的任何干涉都是非法的，而且必将遭到黎巴嫩人民和一切爱好和平人民的沉重打击。
