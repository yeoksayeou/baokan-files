Look, Listen, and Have Fun

　　The Epiphyllum oxypetalum, praised by Comrade Guo Moruo in "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," is a relatively precious potted flower variety. Most of the Epiphyllum oxypetalum cultivated by the Beihai Park gardening team are displayed north of the Yong'an Temple Bridge in the park's front area. Audiences who have not seen this flower can go and feast their eyes.

    令箭荷花盛开
    郭沫若同志在“百花齐放”里所吟咏的令箭荷花是盆花里比较珍贵的品种，北海公园园艺班培植的大部分令箭荷花都陈列在园内前门永安寺大桥以北。没有见过这种花的观众可以去开开眼界。
