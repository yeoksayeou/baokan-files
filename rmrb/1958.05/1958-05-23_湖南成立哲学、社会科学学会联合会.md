    Hunan Establishes Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies

    (Our reporter Gao Changren reports) The Hunan Provincial Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies was recently established in Changsha. This is an important sign of the further prosperity and development of theoretical work in Hunan Province. The Hunan Provincial Philosophy Society, Economics Society, History Society, and Education Society, which were established not long ago, are all member societies of the Federation, and the four societies now have a total of 1,555 members.

    Comrade Zhou Hui, Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, congratulated the establishment of the Federation on behalf of the Provincial Committee. In his speech, Comrade Zhou Hui said that theoretical workers should go deep into the masses, participate in actual struggles, emancipate their minds, learn and do at the same time, so as to improve their ideological level at a faster speed, develop and enrich theory, and continuously strengthen the theoretical team in Hunan Province, so as to better serve socialist construction.

    The meeting unanimously adopted the charter of the Hunan Provincial Federation of Philosophy and Social Science Societies and elected the leading body.
