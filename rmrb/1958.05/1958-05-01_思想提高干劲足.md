    Ideological Improvement Boosts Enthusiasm
    Wang Cai, Furnace Chief of No. 1 Blast Furnace, Beijing Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
    The rectification campaign is truly a good medicine, curing many ideological problems among our workers. Seventy percent of the workers in No. 1 Furnace are young people. Although they are enthusiastic, hardworking, and full of vigor, they have been influenced by bourgeois ideology in recent years, and individualism has greatly developed. The thought of blindly pursuing personal interests has grown. Some even unscrupulously compete for output and rush for time, neglecting mutual assistance and cooperation among comrades, affecting unity and production.
    When the rectification began, the Party General Branch of the Iron Smelting Department led us to carry out extensive airing of views and debates. We debated fundamental issues such as "For whom do we work?" and "How to correctly treat personal and collective interests?" Many veteran workers used vivid facts to criticize the erroneous thinking of some young workers who "don't know how good they have it." Many young workers thoroughly awakened and took the initiative to speak and post big-character posters, criticizing themselves. In this way, many workers who had been ideologically backward in the past have now become advanced elements. Li Zhenhua is one such example. Recently, based on his own experiments, he proposed a new initiative to increase the cotton placement time from eighty minutes to one hundred and twenty minutes per shift, which would double work efficiency. To realize this initiative, he placed cotton at both ends while working, doing the work of two people, and also helping others to operate. Now, the phenomenon of buck-passing between shifts has disappeared, and unity and mutual assistance have been greatly strengthened.
    The great leap forward in ideology has brought about a great leap forward in production. In the past three months, the production targets of our No. 1 Furnace have leapt forward seven times, from the original plan of 186,000 tons per year to 228,000 tons per year.

    思想提高干劲足
    北京石景山钢铁厂一号高炉炉长　王才
    整风真好比一剂良药，治好了我们工人好多思想上的毛病。一号炉的工人中有70％是青年，他们虽然热情肯干，富有朝气，但几年来受了资产阶级思想的影响，个人主义有了很大发展，一味追求个人利益的思想有了滋长。甚至为此不择手段地争产量，抢时间，而忽略了同志间的互助与协作，影响团结和生产。
    整风开始，炼铁部党总支领导我们开展了大鸣大放和大辩论。我们先后辩论了“为谁劳动？”“如何正确对待个人利益和集体利益？”等根本问题。许多老工人用生动的事实批评了某些青工的“身在福中不知福”的错误思想。不少青年工人这才彻底猛省过来，也主动发言和贴大字报，批判自己。这样，许多过去思想比较落后的工人现在都变成了先进分子。李振华就是这样。最近根据他自己的试验，他又提出了一个新的倡议，要把放棉时间由每班八十分钟提高到一百二十分钟，这样可使工作效率提高一倍。为了实现这个倡议，他干活时两头放棉，一个人干两个人的活，还一面帮助别人操作。现在，我们班与班之间扯皮现象已经绝迹，团结互助大为加强。
    思想上的大跃进带来了生产上的大跃进。近三个月来，我们一号炉的生产指标跃进了七次，由原计划年产十八万六千吨跃进到年产二十二万八千吨。
