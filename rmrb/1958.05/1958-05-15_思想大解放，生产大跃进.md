Blooming Flowers of Rectification, Bountiful Fruits of Production

Currently, our city's (Fuxin, Liaoning Province) anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement is in full swing. The fire of extensive rectification, extensive reform, and extensive debate has not only burned away the three winds and five airs of the cadres but has also begun to address the question of who the workers are laboring for. The climax of the rectification campaign has emancipated people's minds, and the emancipation of people's minds has propelled a surge in production, which in turn has propelled the rectification campaign. One movement follows another, one upsurge follows another, causing work to develop rapidly. The deeper the movement, the more methods the cadres have, the higher the workers' enthusiasm for production, and the greater the leap forward in production. This is the law and characteristic of the development of the rectification movement. This objective situation requires our leaders to be good at recognizing and grasping this objective law, constantly standing at the forefront of the movement to guide the movement forward, thereby continuously advancing production and various tasks.

With the deepening and development of the rectification and double-anti movement, our thinking has been liberated, and things that we dared not think, dared not do, and could not do in the past, are now being done. For example, in the past, we formulated plans by assigning tasks from top to bottom, relying only on cadres and not on the masses. Today, we adopt the method of great airing, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters, using the mass line to formulate plans from bottom to top. Because the rectification campaign has deepened step by step, and people's ideological consciousness has been increasing day by day, the planned targets have leapt again and again, and finally, a leap forward plan of 13 million tons to 14 million tons was formulated. According to 13 million tons, the actual output increased by 72 percent compared with last year, that is, more than 5.4 million tons of coal were produced than last year. This is 3 million tons more than the Ministry of Coal's approved leap forward plan of 10 million tons. If the plan of 14 million tons is realized, it will be close to the total of the actual coal production in 1956 and 1957.

Is this coal plan of 13 million tons certain? Our answer is yes. Not only can we reach 13 million tons, but we also want to strive to achieve 14 million tons. Chairman Mao taught us: "If people want to achieve success in their work, that is, to obtain the desired results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." This tells us that theory must be combined with practice. Now, let's talk about the situation of completing the task in four months. The task for the first quarter was arranged according to the proportion of an annual output of 10 million tons, and the plan has already been overfulfilled, that is, more than 2.38 million tons of coal were produced. The task for April was arranged according to the proportion of an annual output of 13 million tons, and the task has already been overfulfilled, that is, 1.18 million tons of coal were produced. If we calculate according to the average number of tasks completed in April, more than 10.66 million tons can be completed by the end of the year, plus more than 2.38 million tons completed in the first quarter, which has already exceeded 13 million tons.

Now let's talk about our production measures:

(1) Greatly increase labor productivity. All coal mines have taken specific measures to improve labor organization, improve mechanical efficiency, reduce or strive to eliminate non-production time, save raw materials (greatly save pit wood), and strengthen technological innovation, without increasing equipment or reducing the number of people. The recovery efficiency has risen linearly: for example, if the recovery efficiency in November 1957 (this month was the highest last year, as 100), then January 1958 was 113, February was 122, March was 130.5, and April was 152. Most of the pits have overfulfilled the operation plan, and the average efficiency of some coal mining sections (thick coal seams) has reached eight to nine tons, an increase of 60%-70% or even doubled compared to the original efficiency. And created a new record of more than twelve tons per shift (one day), and individual sections created an efficiency of twenty-one tons. The seedlings of technological revolution have already appeared. At the same time, we emphasize the preparation work for coal mining; eliminate serious injuries, and strive to eliminate fatal accidents. This is regarded as the first line of defense. This is the main battlefield.

(2) Coal Picking: This year's plan is to pick 2.06 million tons of coal. What is coal picking? It is to extract coal from the ore that comes out of the pit, as the workers say: "The potential of the coal mine is really not small, and great treasures come out of the ore pile." In the past, they were all discarded. Last year, we picked more than 300,000 tons, and this year's plan is to exceed last year by six or seven times. 2.06 million tons of coal is equivalent to almost three and a half Xinqiu vertical shafts (annual output of 600,000 tons) in our city. The Xinqiu vertical shaft has been built for five years and cost more than 30 million yuan. Three and a half Xinqiu vertical shafts would cost more than 100 million yuan, but there is no investment in coal picking, mainly organizing labor to pick it. There are four sources of this labor force: (1) Old men, women, and children aged fifteen or sixteen. At the same time, it solves the living problems of these people. (2) The old, weak, and disabled who are not suitable for continuing to work underground. At the same time, it solves the problem of their resettlement. (3) Reform through labor for prisoners. (4) Middle school students working and studying. At the same time, it solves the problem of their labor training. Prepare some transportation force and labor tools, and take a group of stronger cadres to lead them. That's all, and you can produce 2.06 million tons of coal. This is less investment than opening a small kiln, which is a business with a great return on a small investment, in line with the principle of running an enterprise with diligence and frugality. This is regarded as the second line of defense.

(3) From November last year to now, the mines have reduced 1,931 workers to support construction and newly transferred production units. After the labor efficiency is improved as planned, another group of workers will be reduced, and a new group of tunneling and coal mining sections will be organized to prepare for this year's and next year's production. This is the third line of defense.

Judging from the completion of the task today, only the first line of defense has played most of its role, and its full potential has not yet been realized. The second line of defense plays a part. The third line of defense has not yet entered the battle. Therefore, we have reason to estimate that when the double-anti movement is carried out deeply and thoroughly, and after the technological revolution is launched, the potential of the coal system will be greatly tapped.

Promote Putting Ideology in Command, Overcome Conservative Thinking

The practice of the past four months tells us that it is not smooth sailing to formulate such a leap forward plan that breaks with convention and to realize this plan. It is necessary to go through arduous and fierce ideological struggles again and again, promote putting ideology in command, and overcome conservative thinking before the leap forward plan can be born. Practice proves that the process of making plans and realizing plans is the process of promoting the struggle between ideology and conservative thinking, and it is also the process of constantly improving the plan; it is the process of educating and raising the consciousness of the working class, and it is also the process of educating and raising the consciousness of the cadres. From this, we can draw a conclusion: Any new and advanced thing grows and strengthens in the constant struggle with the old and conservative things. That is, a contradiction is resolved, and new contradictions appear on a new basis. The constant appearance and resolution of contradictions is the law of the development of things.

For example, when this year's plan jumped from 8.26 million tons to 9.2 million tons, a sharp debate occurred between promoting ideology and conservative thinking. A few comrades with conservative thinking emphasized objective difficulties, believing that today's equipment capacity, transportation conditions, and mechanical conditions are not equipped to produce 9.2 million tons, and they can only strive to complete 9 million tons and cannot guarantee the completion of 9.2 million tons. The ideological source of this condition-based thinking is the strange phenomenon of seeing things but not people and purely technical views. They did not see the favorable situation in the country, nor did they see the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the workers after the rectification campaign. When discussing the leap forward plan of 9.6 million tons, we encountered the same controversy again. They only believe in gradual progress and do not believe in leap forward, thinking that jumping high will lead to a heavy fall. In fact, this number is a number that the masses have already affirmed through discussion, and they believe that the masses do not understand the situation and speak irresponsibly, etc. Later, these comrades continued to improve in the double-anti movement, especially were persuaded by the facts of completing the task in the first quarter and April, and made self-criticisms. This is to improve the consciousness of cadres in the discussion of the production plan. When leaping to an annual output of 10 million tons, conservative thinking made a comeback, saying that "10 million tons has no material basis." Some also said: "Is there a standard for the leap forward?" The municipal party committee also believed that 10 million tons was the peak of this year's plan, which is also conservative thinking. With the rectification campaign to run "experimental fields" and contact with reality, we discovered that the potential of coal is endless, so we leapt to 11 million to 12 million tons and 13 million to 14 million tons. At this time, many people were greatly surprised, and many engineering and technical personnel were skeptical. Some people thought that if all the coal was mined this year, what would be mined next year? There is also the same conservative thinking in realizing the plan and formulating measures. These doubts were basically resolved until the task was completed in April. If the task is not completed, there will be more trouble.

Comparing this year's plan with previous years' plans, we can draw an important experience and lesson: The same conditions, the same coalfield, but different plans were formulated. In previous years, plans were formulated relying on the engineer's slide rule, not on the enthusiasm of the workers. The method was to assign tasks from top to bottom level by level, and the lower levels had three to five lines of defense, resulting in a conservative plan in the shape of an inverted pagoda that became less and less as it went down. The Fuxin Mining Bureau's plan for 1957 only increased by 280,000 tons compared to 1956, while this year's plan increased by more than 5.4 million tons compared to 1957, a difference of about 20 times compared to the increase in 1957. Because this year's plan was formulated relying on the masses from bottom to top, it was more and more from bottom to top level by level, and even more at the workers' level, forming a leap forward plan in the shape of a positive pagoda that became larger and larger as it went down. The former is putting conservative thinking in command, seeing things but not people, fighting alone, at a loss, and formulating plans with a frown and completing plans with a frown; the latter is putting promoting ideology in command, relying on the wisdom of the broad masses, with a powerful army and galloping horses, invincible, and formulating plans and completing plans easily and happily. The same masses and the same working conditions made different plans. This shows that subjective initiative has played an important role. Therefore, in formulating production plans and realizing production plans, we must constantly overcome conservative thinking.

But only the enthusiasm of the masses, without the Party's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical to arm the masses' minds, the masses will lose their way; only the Party's policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, without the enthusiasm of the masses, the policy cannot be implemented. With the combination of the Party's guidelines and policies and the wisdom of the masses, infinite material strength will be generated. Therefore, the Party's organizations and leaders at all levels must always maintain a cool head, sensitively discover the emerging fresh things, and rely on the Party's guidelines and policies and the enthusiasm of the broad masses to launch a ruthless struggle against all bureaucratic, subjectivist, and conservative thinking that hinders new things and production development, do a good job in the communist ideological emancipation movement, grasp the essence and mainstream of the problem, make new things grow and strengthen, and make production develop continuously and rapidly.

Improve Leadership Methods, Transform Leadership Style

Through the rectification movement, cadres have set fire to themselves, and the relationship between leading cadres at all levels and the masses has become closer. Since mid-March, after the provincial party committee summarized and promoted the experience of the Central Machinery Repair Factory in learning from "experimental fields" to improve leadership style, the experience of Ping'an Mine's three-pit leading cadres participating in labor to lead production, and the experience of Ping'an Mine's leading cadres moving to workers' residences to settle down, a total of 51 "experimental fields" were set up in various factories and mines. More than 350 leading cadres at all levels (including party and mass cadres, section cadres, and pit and workshop leading cadres) participated in the "experimental fields," and more than 300 cadres moved to workers' residences to settle down, accounting for more than 90% of the cadres who should have moved. At the same time, the office system of enterprise organs was reformed. Because coal mines are underground factories with high mobility, production is constantly changing, and production is carried out in three shifts for 24 hours. The office system of organs during the day can only participate in the leadership of one shift of production, and no one is in charge of the other two shifts, especially the night shift has the most problems, which has the greatest impact on production. The enterprise organ has been unable to adapt to production needs. The mines have created: two-shift system, shift system, follow-up system, which are very popular with workers and have a great impetus to production.

We believe that the participation of leading cadres in production to lead production, the relocation of enterprise cadres to workers' residences, and the change of the office system are fundamental reforms in the transformation of the style of enterprise leading cadres, a revolution in leadership style and leadership methods, and a fundamental change in the separation of enterprise cadres from the masses and from production, completely overcoming bureaucracy and subjectivism, and realizing the correct path of combining political work and economic work, and unifying politics and technology.

Since cadres participated in labor and participated in production to lead production, the work of factories and mines has been completely renewed. The leadership methods of "listening," "watching," "pushing," and "dragging" have been changed, and the phenomenon of mutual buck-passing and passing the buck has disappeared or decreased. In the past, cadres sat in the office all day to hold meetings, burying and consuming a lot of valuable time and energy in trivial affairs, without any time and energy to manage production. Because administrative affairs did not solve major production problems, people followed behind them every day asking to solve problems. Cadres were like owing debts, afraid of people collecting debts, and secretly hiding in hidden places to hold meetings. After participating in production to lead production, many problems were solved anytime and anywhere. Cadres said: "After participating in production and labor, work is not more tiring, but more relaxed, and the debts owed have been paid off at once." Workers said: "In the past, problems found cadres, but now cadres find problems." After participating in production and participating in labor to lead production, the relationship between cadres and the masses has become closer, cadres have a deeper understanding of the pain and suffering of the masses, and the masses are more concerned about cadres. At the beginning of the rectification campaign, workers posted big-character posters criticizing cadres, but now workers write big-character posters praising cadres. The workers of the tenth section of the third pit of Ping'an Mine said: "In the past, our section chief glared like a cow, but now he doesn't smile or speak, like a big girl." Huang Jinyou, the pit chief of the second pit, used to have a stiff attitude, and the workers were afraid of him and called him "Huang Tiger." During the airing and blooming, he was given hundreds of big-character posters. After he solved the problems raised by the masses, he and the party branch secretary and six other comrades went deep into the pit to engage in "experimental fields," often participating in production in the pit to lead production. The masses were moved and said: "Old Huang has changed for the better." The workers gave each of the six comrades a covered bowl and a mirror to express encouragement. The workers in this pit have the greatest enthusiasm and have improved coal mining technology. The average efficiency per worker is 8.5 tons, and the highest record is 12.22 tons. The workers have been discussing. This one said: "Our section chief is good." That one said: "Our section chief is stronger than yours." Cadres are relaxed and happy, and they no longer feel that they are bean cake cadres squeezed from top to bottom. After Ding Yushan, the party secretary of Ping'an Mine, and Chen Haishan, the mine director, moved to the workers' residences, they talked to hundreds of workers and made friends with them. An old worker went to Ding Yushan's house for a visit and patted Ding on the shoulder and said: "Old Ding, you lead me in work, and I am your eldest brother at home, and you are still my younger brother." This is one aspect. On the other hand, through the "experimental fields," party, government, and mass cadres and engineering and technical personnel have begun to move towards the road of red and expert, strengthening the workers' sense of responsibility as masters. In the past, administrative cadres believed that administrative cadres were just giving orders. If they did political and ideological work, what would the party and mass cadres do? After participating in labor and participating in production, they deeply realized that this idea was wrong. Engineering and technical personnel participated in labor and debated with workers, and felt that workers really had a way. Many engineers said: "Relying solely on the slide rule and drawings to command production is no longer feasible. We must combine our technology with the enthusiasm of the workers." The workers' minds have been liberated, their mood is comfortable, and their enthusiasm for production is even higher. Especially through directly participating in production management and participating in the formulation of plans, their sense of responsibility as masters has been greatly enhanced. Through running "experimental fields," the municipal party committee and party committees at all levels have become more familiar with the production situation, and thus it is easier to accurately decide problems and direct the rectification campaign and the production upsurge to move forward side by side according to the situation of the movement and according to the Party's guidelines.

　　思想大解放，生产大跃进
　　中共辽宁省阜新市委第一书记　丘新野
    整风之花盛开  生产之果硕大
    现在我市反浪费反保守运动，正热火朝天地开展着。大整、大改、大辩论的烈火，不仅烧掉了干部的三风五气，也开始解决了工人为谁劳动的问题。整风高潮使人们的思想解放了，人们的思想解放，推动了生产高潮，生产高潮又反过来推动整风高潮。一个运动接着一个运动，一个高潮接着一个高潮，使工作不断地飞速的发展。运动越深入，干部的办法越多，工人的生产积极性越高，从而生产跃进得越大。这是整风运动发展的规律和特点。这一客观形势就要求我们领导者要善于认识和掌握这一客观规律，经常站在运动前面指导运动不断地前进，从而使生产和各种工作不断地前进。
    随着整风和双反运动的深入和发展，我们思想解放了，我们过去不敢想、不敢作、也不可能作到的事情，今天作到了。比如我们制订计划，历年都是自上而下地派任务，只靠干部不靠群众。今天我们采取大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报，群众路线的办法，自下而上地制定计划。由于整风步步深入，人们的思想觉悟日益提高，计划指标一跃再跃，终于制订了一个一千三百万吨到一千四百万吨的跃进计划。按一千三百万吨，比去年实际产量增长了百分之七十二，即比去年多产煤炭五百四十多万吨。比煤炭部批准的一千万吨的跃进计划多三百万吨，如果实现一千四百万吨的计划，将接近于1956年和1957年煤炭实际产量的总和。
    这个一千三百万吨的煤炭计划，有没有把握呢？我们的回答是有把握。不但可以达到一千三百万吨，还想争取实现一千四百万吨。毛主席教导我们说：“人们要想得到工作胜利即得到预想的结果，一定使自己思想合乎客观外界规律性，如果不合就会在实践中失败。”这就是告诉我们理论必须与实践相结合。现在就拿四个月完成任务的情况来说说吧。第一季度是按年产一千万吨的比例布置的任务，已经超额完成计划了，即产煤二百三十八万多吨。4月份是按年产一千三百万吨比例布置的任务，已经超额完成了任务，即出煤炭一百一十八万吨。如按4月份完成任务平均数计算，到年底可以完成一千零六十六万多吨，再加上一季度完成的二百三十八万多吨，已经超过一千三百万吨了。
    现在说说我们的生产措施：
    （一）大大的提高劳动生产率。各煤矿在不增加设备、减少人的情况下，在改善劳动组织、提高机械效率、减少或争取消灭非生产时间、节约原材料（大大节约坑木）、加强技术革新等方面，采取了具体措施。回采效率直线上升：如以1957年11月份回采效率（这个月是去年最高的，为100，则1958年1月份为113，2月份为122，3月份为130.5，4月份为152。大部分坑口超额完成了作业计划，一部分采煤段（厚煤层）回采工效率平均达到八吨至九吨，比原来的效率提高60％—70％，甚至一倍。并创造了原班（一天）十二吨以上的新纪录，个别的段创造了二十一吨的效率。技术革命的苗头已经出现了。在此同时强调采煤的准备工作；消灭重伤事故，争取消灭死亡事故。这算作第一道防线。这是主要战场。
    （二）拣煤：今年计划拣煤二百零六万吨。什么叫拣煤？就是从坑下出来的矿石上长着煤，从矿石里面把煤取出来，拿工人的话说：“煤矿潜力真不小，矿石堆里出大宝”。过去都扔掉，去年我们拣三十多万吨，今年计划比去年超过六、七倍。二百零六万吨煤炭相当于我市新丘立井（年产六十万吨）三个半差一点。新丘立井建井五年，投资三千多万元，三个半新丘立井就要投资一亿多，可是拣煤没有什么投资，主要是组织劳动力去拣就是了。这批劳动力有四个来源：（一）老头、妇女、十五、六岁的娃娃。同时解决了这些人的生活问题。（二）不适于继续在井下劳动的老弱残废。同时解决了对他们的安置问题。（三）犯人劳动改造。（四）勤工俭学的中学生。同时解决了他们的劳动锻炼问题。再准备一些运输力量、劳动工具，拿一批较强的干部领导，别的没有了，就能出二百零六万吨煤。这比开一个小窑的投资还要少，这是个一本万利的生意，合乎勤俭办企业原则的。这算作第二道防线。
    （三）从去年11月到现在，各矿已减下一千九百三十一个工人，支援建设和新移交的生产单位。计划提高劳动效率后，再减一批工人，组织一批新的掘进段和采煤段，给今年和明年生产作好准备工作。这是第三道防线。
    从今天完成任务的情况看，这三道防线，也只是第一道防线发挥了大部分作用，尚未发挥全部潜力。第二道防线起一部分作用。第三道防线，尚未投入战斗。因此，我们有理由估计双反运动搞深搞透的时候，和技术革命开展后，煤炭系统的潜力会大大的被挖掘出来。
    促进思想挂帅  保守思想克服
    四个来月的实践告诉我们，制定出这样一个突破常规的跃进计划和实现这个计划，都不是一帆风顺的。而是要经过三番五次的艰巨的激烈的思想斗争，促进思想挂帅了，战胜了保守思想，跃进计划才能诞生出来。实践证明，订计划和实现计划的过程，就是促进思想与保守思想的斗争过程，也是计划不断完整的过程；是教育提高工人阶级觉悟的过程，也是教育提高干部觉悟的过程。从此，得出一个结论：任何新的先进的东西，都是在和旧的保守的东西不断斗争中成长壮大起来的。也就是一个矛盾解决了，在新的基础上又出现新的矛盾，矛盾不断地出现，不断地解决，就是事物发展的规律。
    比如今年订计划时由八百二十六万吨跃到九百二十万吨时，促进思想与保守思想发生了尖锐的争论。有保守思想的少数同志，强调客观困难，认为今天的设备能力、运输条件、机械条件，都不具备生产九百二十万吨的条件，只能争取完成九百万吨，不能保证完成九百二十万吨。这种条件论的思想根源，是见物不见人的单纯技术观点作怪，他们没有看见全国的有利形势，没看到整风后工人空前高涨的积极性。当讨论跃进计划九百六十万吨的时候，又遇到了同样的争论。他们只相信渐进，不相信跃进，认为跳得高会跌得重。其实这个数是群众讨论已经肯定了的数，他们认为群众不了解情况，说话不负责任等等。后来这些同志在双反运动中不断地提高，特别被一季度和4月份完成任务的事实说服了，作了检讨。这是在讨论生产计划中提高了干部的觉悟。跃到年产一千万吨的时候，保守思想又卷土重来，说什么“一千万吨没有物质基础”。也有的说：“跃进还有个标准没有？”市委对一千万吨也认为是今年计划的顶峰，这也是保守思想。随着整风搞“试验田”，接触实际，才又发现了煤炭的潜力是无穷无尽的，所以又跃到一千一百万至一千二百万和一千三百万至一千四百万吨。到这时候，使很多人大吃一惊，很多工程技术人员半信半疑，有的认为今年都采完了，明年采啥？在实现计划和订措施中也有同样的保守思想。这些疑团一直到4月份完成了任务，才算基本上解决了。如果完不成任务，那麻烦就多了。
    今年制订计划和往年制订计划对比一下，得出一条重要的经验教训：同样条件，同样的煤田，订出不同的计划。历年都是依靠工程师的计算尺订计划，不依靠工人的积极性订计划，作法是自上而下按级压任务，下边都有三道到五道的防御工事，结果计划形成越往下越少的倒宝塔形的保守计划。阜新矿务局1957年的计划比1956年只增长二十八万吨，今年计划比1957年增长五百四十多万吨，与1957年增长数相比，相差二十来倍。因为今年是依靠群众自下而上订计划，从而自下而上一级比一级多，到工人那里就更多，形成一个越往下越大的正宝塔形的跃进计划。前者是保守思想挂帅，见物不见人，孤军奋战，一筹莫展，订计划愁眉苦脸，完成计划也是愁眉苦脸；后者是促进思想挂帅，有广大群众的智慧为依靠，千军万马，势如破竹，所向无敌，订计划和完成计划都轻松愉快。同样群众，同样工作条件，作出了不同的计划。这就说明了主观能动性起到了重要的作用。因此，订生产计划和实现生产计划，都要不断的克服保守思想。
    但是只有群众的积极性，没有党的多快好省的方针武装群众的思想，群众会迷失方向的；只有党的多快好省的方针，没有群众的积极性，方针也不能贯彻。有了党的方针政策和群众智慧的结合，就产生无穷无尽的物质力量。因此我们党的各级组织和领导者要时刻保持冷静的头脑，敏感的发现萌芽的新鲜事物，并依靠党的方针政策和广大群众的积极性，向一切阻碍新生事物、生产发展的官僚主义、主观主义和保守思想展开无情的斗争，搞好共产主义思想解放运动，抓住问题本质和主流，使新生事物成长壮大起来，使生产不断地飞跃地发展。
    改进领导方法  转变领导作风
    通过整风运动，干部引火烧身，各级领导干部与群众的关系更加密切了。自3月中旬省委总结推广中央机修厂学习“试验田”改进领导作风、平安矿三坑领导干部参加劳动领导生产、平安矿领导干部搬到工人住宅落户的经验后，各厂矿共搞了五十一块“试验田”，各级领导干部（包括党群、科室干部和坑口、车间领导干部）三百五十多人参加了“试验田”，干部到工人住宅落户的三百多人，占应搬家的干部90％多。在此同时，进行了企业机关办公制度的改革。因为煤矿是流动性很大的地下工厂，生产时刻都在变化，二十四小时都在按三班轮流生产，机关白天办公制只能是参加一班领导生产，其他两班就没人管，特别夜班问题最多，对生产影响最大，企业机关化已不能适应生产需要了。各矿创造了：两班制、轮班制、跟班制，非常受工人欢迎，对生产的推动作用很大。
    我们认为，领导干部参加生产领导生产、企业干部搬到工人住宅落户和办公制度的改变，是企业领导干部转变作风的根本性改革，是领导作风、领导方法的革命，是从根本上改变企业干部脱离群众、脱离生产，彻底克服官僚主义、主观主义，实现政治工作和经济工作结合，政治和技术统一的正确道路。
    从干部参加劳动、参加生产领导生产以后，厂矿的工作面貌焕然一新。改变了那种“听”、“看”、“推”、“拖”的领导方法，互相扯皮、踢皮球的现象没有了或减少了。过去干部终日坐在办公室里开会，把很多宝贵时间和精力都淹没和消耗在繁琐的事务上边，没有一点时间和精力管理生产。因为事务主义没解决生产上的重大问题，所以天天有人跟在屁股后边要求解决问题，干部像欠债一样，怕人讨债，偷偷的躲在隐蔽地方开会。参加生产领导生产后，很多问题都随时随地解决了。干部说：“参加生产劳动以后，工作不是更累，而是更轻松了，欠的债一下子还清了。”工人说：“过去是问题找干部，现在是干部找问题。”参加生产、参加劳动领导生产以后，干群关系更加密切了，干部对群众的痛痒体会得深了，群众也更加关心干部了。整风开始时工人贴大字报批评干部，现在工人写大字报表扬干部。平安矿三坑十段的工人说：“过去我们段长眼睛一瞪像牛一样，现在不笑不说话，好像个大姑娘。”二坑坑长黄金有，过去态度生硬，工人都怕他，叫他“黄老虎”，鸣放时给他贴了几百张大字报。他把群众提出的问题解决后，就和党总支书记等六个同志深入坑下搞“试验田”，经常在坑下参加生产，领导生产。群众感动地说：“老黄转变好了。”工人们送给他们六个同志每人一个扣碗、一面镜子，表示鼓励。这个坑工人劲头最大，改进了采煤技术，每工效率平均八点五吨，最高纪录十二点二二吨。工人们纷纷议论。这个说：“我们的段长好。”那个说：“我们的段长比你们的强。”干部轻松愉快了，再也不觉得自己是上压下挤的豆饼干部了。平安矿党委书记丁玉山和矿长陈海山搬到工人住宅后，都和上百个工人谈过话，和他们交了朋友。老工人到丁玉山家串门，拍着丁的肩膀说：“老丁，在工作上你领导我，在家里我是你的大哥，你还是弟弟呢。”这是一方面。另一方面，通过“试验田”，党、政、群干部和工程技术人员开始向红专道路前进，加强了工人的主人翁责任感。行政干部过去认为行政干部就是发号施令的，如作政治思想工作，党群干部干什么？参加劳动，参加生产后，深深体会到这种想法错了。工程技术人员参加劳动和工人辩论大会，感到工人真有办法。很多工程师表示：“只靠计算尺、图纸指挥生产吃不开了，必须把自己的技术和工人的积极性结合起来”。工人思想解放了，心情舒畅了，生产积极性更高了，特别通过直接参加生产管理和参加订计划，主人翁的责任感大大提高。市委和各级党委通过搞“试验田”，对生产情况更加熟悉了，从而也就更容易根据运动的情况，按照党的方针准确地决定问题，指挥整风高潮和生产高潮并肩前进。
