Xinhua News Agency, May 24th, Tokyo dispatch: "Nihon Keizai Shimbun" published an article today pointing out that how to resolve the various outstanding issues that have recently occurred between Japan and China will inevitably become the biggest issue for the new Japanese government that is about to be established.
Despite the Kishida government's efforts to spread slander and attacks against China during the election, after the election, the Japanese people resolutely demanded that the Japanese government resolve the issue of Sino-Japanese relations.
The article said that the voice of the Japanese economic community condemning the Kishida government's past erroneous attitude towards Sino-Japanese relations is growing louder. The economic community also demanded that the Kishida government seriously consider adopting a friendly attitude towards China.
"Asahi Shimbun" also published the demands of prominent figures from all walks of life to the Kishida government today. Commentator Katsui Kamei, Aichi University professor Kiichiro Irie, and Japanese government Ministry of Justice special advisor Seiichiro Ono all unanimously demanded that the Japanese government take measures to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Japanese legal authority Seiichiro Ono pointed out that Japan cannot maintain economic and cultural coexistence with various countries in Asia if it ignores the existence of China. Speaking about the issue of displaying the Chinese flag in Japan, he said that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law does not distinguish between countries with and without diplomatic relations, and this law should also apply to the flag issue of countries that have not established diplomatic relations with Japan.
Public opinion recorded on the streets by "Mainichi Shimbun" shows that the majority of the people demanded that the Kishida government change its policy towards China. A 25-year-old female office worker said that it would be a big mistake for the Kishida government to think that its policy towards China had won the support of the masses in the election. We young people demand a change in the foreign policy of leaning unilaterally towards the United States.
Commentator Ayako Ishigaki published a statement in "Mainichi Shimbun," accusing the Liberal Democratic Party of always handling China issues with a sense of "superiority." She said that this proves that in the minds of these people, there is a self-centered ideology that ignores the new situation in Asia. Ayako Ishigaki demanded that the Kishida government change its foreign policy of being the tail of a certain major power and only acting according to the wishes of that major power, and adopt an independent and autonomous policy from the standpoint of the Japanese people.

    日本各界人士继续大声疾呼
    要岸信介改变敌视中国的政策
    新华社24日讯　东京消息：“日本经济新闻”今天发表一篇文章指出，如何解决最近在日中两国间发生的各种悬而未决的问题，势将成为不久就要成立的日本新政府最大的课题。
    尽管岸信介政府在大选期间尽量散布诽谤和攻击中国的谬论，日本人民在大选结束后，还是坚决要求日本政府解决日中关系问题。
    这篇文章说，日本经济界谴责岸信介政府在过去对日中关系所采取的错误态度的声浪越来越大。经济界还要求岸信介政府认真考虑对中国采取友好态度。
    “朝日新闻”今天也刊登了各界著名人士对岸信介政府的要求。评论家龟井胜一郎、爱知大学教授入江启四郎、日本政府法务省特别顾问小野清一郎等一致要求日本政府采取恢复日中邦交的措施。日本法学权威小野清一郎指出，忽视中国的存在，日本是不能在亚洲同各国在经济上和文化上保持共处关系的。他谈到在日本悬挂中国国旗问题时说，日本刑法第九十二条对有邦交和无邦交的国家并没有区别，这条法律也应该照样适用于和日本没有建立邦交的国家的国旗问题。
    “每日新闻”在街头录音的群众意见表明，大多数人民群众要求岸信介政府改变对中国的政策。一位二十五岁的女职员说，岸信介政府如果以为它的对中国的政策在大选中获得了群众的支持，那是大错特错。我们青年是要求改变向美国一边倒的外交政策的。
    评论家石垣绫子在“每日新闻”发表谈话，指责自由民主党一向抱着“优越感”来处理中国问题。她说，这证明在这些人的脑筋里有忽视亚洲新形势的唯我独尊的思想。石垣绫子要求岸信介政府改变它的做某一个大国的尾巴、只看这个大国的眼色办事的外交政策，站在日本人民的立场采取独立自主的政策。
