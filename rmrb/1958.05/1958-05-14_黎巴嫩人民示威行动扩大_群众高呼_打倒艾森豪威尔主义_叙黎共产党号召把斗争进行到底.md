Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 13th: Reports indicate that the scale of demonstrations against the pro-Western government in various parts of Lebanon further expanded on the 12th. Simultaneously, the government dispatched troops to take over cities such as Beirut and Tripoli, intensifying suppression. Demonstrators continued to clash with military police in various locations. The government also sealed the border between Lebanon and the Syrian region of the United Arab Republic.

In Beirut, the general strike and market strike have expanded from the city center to the suburbs. Clashes between demonstrators and military police have resulted in fourteen deaths. Demonstrators shouted slogans such as "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine" and burned down the United States Information Service library in Beirut. The government declared a curfew in Beirut. The city's streets and squares are filled with fully armed soldiers, and American-made armored vehicles and trucks equipped with machine guns patrol everywhere.

Meanwhile, the Iraq Petroleum Company's pipeline in the northern border region of Lebanon has been damaged. This pipeline runs from Kirkuk in Iraq to Tripoli. In Tripoli, the general strike, which began on the 9th, continues, and demonstrators continue to clash with military police. Strikes and market strikes have also occurred in many parts of southern Lebanon. Clashes between demonstrators and police also occurred in the Sufr Mountains.

The demonstrations that have taken place in various parts of Lebanon since the 9th were held in response to the call by various opposition parties and nationalist leaders, who protested the assassination of the prominent nationalist leader and publisher of "Telegraph," Matni, opposed the government's policies that violate national interests, and demanded the resignation of President Chamoun. Chamoun's term is due to expire in September of this year, and he is attempting to amend the constitution in order to be re-elected as president.

According to Damascus newspapers, the Maronite Archbishop of Lebanon, Maushi, warned the US Ambassador to Lebanon on the 12th not to interfere in the situation in Lebanon. He said that he would take to the streets to fight against any interference.

Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 12th: The Syrian and Lebanese Communist Parties issued a statement on the evening of the 11th, stating that the struggle currently being waged by the Lebanese people is a struggle against imperialism and its agents, as well as against the Eisenhower Doctrine and Chamoun's policy of subservience.

The statement called on the people to continue the struggle until the agents of imperialism are defeated.
