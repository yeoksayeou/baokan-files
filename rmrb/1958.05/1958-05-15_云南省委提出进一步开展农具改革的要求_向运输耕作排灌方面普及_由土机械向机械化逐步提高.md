The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee recently convened a conference on tool reform to summarize the basic experiences of tool reform. By the end of May, the task of carting would be completed throughout the province; more than 1,000 types of improved tools have been successfully tested and promoted throughout the province, totaling 1.5 million pieces; approximately 2 million laborers have used improved tools. Due to the development of the tool reform movement, changes have begun to occur in agricultural production and the ideological consciousness of the broad masses of farmers. First, it greatly improved agricultural labor productivity and reduced the labor intensity of farmers; broke down conservative and superstitious ideas; and brought into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of cadres and the masses. At the same time, tool reform further strengthened the relationship between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses. The masses reflected that tool reform was a "second liberation" and a "second emancipation."

The reason this work was done well is that the leadership was firm, determined, energetic, and willing to study hard. The whole Party was mobilized, and all cadres strived to be both red and expert in the movement, experimenting together with the masses. This is the key to doing a good job in the movement. Second, believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and educating the masses, taking the mass line, and giving full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, is the fundamental foundation for carrying out this movement. Third, timely and conscientiously summarizing the advanced experiences of the masses, and quickly and effectively promoting them, popularizing and improving them. Fourth, adapting to local conditions, using local materials, and fully tapping the potential of the masses to ensure that tool reform is carried out with more, faster, better, and more economical results.

This meeting discussed how to further carry out the tool reform movement in the future. In future tool reform, first of all, agricultural mechanization, semi-mechanization, and indigenous mechanization should be combined. At present, the main task is to rely on the masses to engage in indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization, while also paying attention to mechanization; on this basis, gradually improve and gradually increase the degree of semi-mechanization and mechanization. It is wrong to not actively carry out the reform of old-fashioned farm tools, not actively engage in indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization, and wait for tractors. It is also wrong to only be satisfied with the reform of old-fashioned farm tools, not actively engage in semi-mechanization and mechanization, and not pay attention to the improvement of tool reform. Both of these ideas will hinder the mobilization of the masses and affect the development of the tool reform movement.

Secondly, tool reform should be popularized in all aspects, improved on the basis of popularization, and popularized under the guidance of improvement. First of all, in terms of regions, it should be promoted with emphasis, and gradually popularized to all regions and all agricultural cooperatives, from point to surface.

Improvement is to gradually develop and gradually improve from indigenous mechanization and semi-mechanization to mechanization. Special attention should be paid to the rapid promotion of advanced tools that have now been created and invented with high efficiency and good quality, so as to promote them widely and quickly. Backward tools with low efficiency, high labor intensity, and poor quality should be gradually eliminated. The current focus is on utilizing animal power, water power, and wind power. According to the three principles of being conducive to improving work efficiency, conducive to reducing labor intensity, and conducive to improving labor quality, attention should be paid to popularizing and improving the following three aspects. In terms of transportation, the amount of transportation labor in Yunnan generally ranks first in agricultural labor. Especially after the increase in agricultural capital construction tasks, transportation accounts for approximately 35%-40% of agricultural labor. The tension in the labor force has formed a prominent contradiction. Therefore, it is necessary to greatly improve and promote transportation tools. In terms of cultivation, including plowing, harrowing, sowing, inter-cultivation weeding to harvesting, labor generally accounts for 30%-40%, and in some cases 50%. The contradiction is also very prominent in the current spring plowing, and it is also necessary to seize the improvement and promotion of tools in this area. Rural water conservancy and irrigation labor accounts for approximately 10%-15% in general agricultural cooperatives. Improving water lifting tools, animal-powered and wind-powered water pumps, threshing and processing of agricultural and sideline products, and household labor tools are the urgent needs of the broad masses of women farmers and should not be ignored.

The meeting also paid attention to solving the problem of improving and raising the level of operation and management of agricultural cooperatives. After the tool reform, the scope of operation and management of agricultural cooperatives has also expanded, the content of production has increased, and agricultural cooperatives need to make necessary specialized divisions of labor under unified leadership. The unified arrangement, rational allocation, and use of labor force need to be reconsidered, so that each labor force can be used in the most suitable place where it can exert its role and enthusiasm, and labor quotas must also be changed, and work points must be reasonable.

In order to further carry out the tool reform movement, local industry and handicrafts must conscientiously implement the policy of serving agricultural production, strengthen the close cooperation between local industry, handicrafts, and agricultural cooperatives, and promote each other. In specific cooperation, in the future, indigenous mechanized tools should mainly be produced by agricultural cooperatives themselves. A small number or parts of accessories that cannot be produced due to equipment and technical conditions should be assisted by handicrafts; handicrafts and local industry should mainly engage in the production of semi-mechanized and mechanized products with higher technology and efficiency; mechanized products that local industry cannot solve should be produced by state-owned industry. In addition, commerce and transportation departments should also provide assistance.

At the same time, technical guidance must be strengthened so that the broad masses of farmers can master the technology. Various training courses should be held in various places to train technical backbones.

　　云南省委提出进一步开展农具改革的要求
    向运输耕作排灌方面普及
    由土机械向机械化逐步提高
    本报讯　中共云南省委最近召开的工具改革会议，总结了工具改革的基本经验。到5月底，全省范围内将完成车子化的任务；全省试验成功和推广的改良工具已有一千多种，计一百五十万件；大约有二百万劳动者使用了改良工具。由于工具改革运动的发展，已开始引起了农业生产和广大农民思想意识形态等方面的变化。首先是大大地提高了农业的劳动生产率，减轻了农民的劳动强度；打破了保守、迷信思想；发挥了广大干部和群众的积极性和创造性。同时通过工具改革也进一步密切了党与群众的关系、干部与群众的关系。群众中反映工具改革是“第二次解放”“第二次翻身”。
    这件工作做得好的原因是领导上坚定，有决心、有干劲、肯艰苦钻研，全党动员，全体干部在运动中努力做到又红又专，同群众在一起试验，这是搞好运动的关键。其次，相信群众，依靠群众，教育群众，走群众路线，充分发挥群众的积极性和创造性，是开展这一运动的根本基础。第三、及时认真地总结群众中的先进经验，并迅速有效地加以推广，普及提高。第四、是因地制宜，就地取材，充分发掘群众的潜力，保证工具改革又多、又快、又好、又省地开展起来。
    这次会议对今后如何进一步开展工具改革运动进行了讨论。在今后的工具改革中，首先要把农业机械化、半机械化、土机械化三者结合起来。目前主要是依靠群众搞土机械化、半机械化，同时还要注意机械化；在这个基础上逐步提高，逐步增加半机械化、机械化的程度。不去积极进行旧式农具的改革，不积极搞土机械化、半机械化，坐等拖拉机是不对的。只满足于旧式农具的改革，不积极搞半机械化、机械化，不注意工具改革的提高，也是不对的。这两种思想都会妨碍群众积极性的发挥，影响工具改革运动的发展。
    其次是要把工具改革普及到各个方面去，在普及的基础上提高，在提高的指导下普及。首先是地区上应当有重点地推广，逐步普及到所有的地区、所有的农业社，由点到面。
    提高是要由土机械化、半机械化到机械化，逐步发展，逐步提高。特别要注意迅速推广现在已经创造发明的效率高、质量好的先进工具，做到推广的又广又快。对效率低、费力大、质量差的落后工具，要逐步淘汰。当前主要是把畜力、水力和风力利用起来。应当根据有利于提高工效、有利于减轻劳动强度、有利于提高劳动质量的三个原则，注意从下列三方面普及提高。在运输方面，云南一般运输劳动量占农业劳动的第一位，特别是农业基本建设任务加大以后，运输力量约占农业劳动的35％—40％。劳动力的紧张状况形成了突出的矛盾。所以必须大量改良推广运输工具。在耕作方面，包括犁、耙、播种、中耕除草到收割，劳动力一般占30％—40％，多的占50％。在目前的春耕中矛盾也很突出，也需要抓紧改良推广这方面的工具。农村的水利排灌劳动在一般农业社约占10％—15％。改良提水工具，畜力、风力的抽水机，脱粒和农副产品的加工，家务劳动的工具，是广大妇女农民的迫切要求，也不可忽视。
    会议还注意解决改善和提高农业社的经营管理水平问题。工具改革以后，农业社的经营管理范围也随着扩大，生产内容增多，农业社需要在统一的领导下，作必要的专业性的分工。劳动力的统一安排、合理调配、使用，需作重新考虑，使每个劳动力都能使用在最适合、最能发挥作用和积极性的地方，劳动定额也必须改变，工分要合理。
    为了进一步开展工具改革运动，地方工业、手工业要认真贯彻为农业生产服务的方针，加强地方工业、手工业、农业社的密切协作，相互促进。在具体协作上，今后土机械化的工具，主要应由农业社自己搞，少数或部分因设备和技术条件不能生产的配件，手工业应帮助生产；手工业和地方工业主要搞技术、效率更高一点的半机械化和机械化的产品；属机械化而地方工业不能解决的由国营工业搞。此外，商业、交通运输部门也应给予帮助。
    与此同时，还必须加强技术指导，使广大农民群众能够掌握技术。各地应举办各种训练班培养技术骨干。
