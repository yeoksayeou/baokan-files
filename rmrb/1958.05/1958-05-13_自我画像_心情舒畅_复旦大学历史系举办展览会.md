　　Self-Portraits: A Feeling of Ease

　　History Department of Fudan University Holds Exhibition

　　(Our Newspaper) This newspaper reports: The third-year students of the History Department of Fudan University recently held an exhibition of self-portraits to criticize bourgeois individualism. At the exhibition, viewers faced a variety of self-portraits and could see all sorts of faces of individualism. Everyone believes that doing this has many benefits: First, it exposes bourgeois individualism more comprehensively and profoundly. Because one knows oneself best, the exposure is also more profound. For example, one student, for the sake of fame and fortune, wanted to go to France to "gild" himself after graduation, so that he could at least become an associate professor upon returning to China. However, he felt that this idea was wrong and never even told his lover about it. During this self-portrait exercise, he comprehensively and systematically exposed his individualistic thoughts, and this exposure was also profound.

　　Second, everyone receives a profound education and feels at ease. All students with individualistic thoughts have dug out their ugly thoughts and expressed them in vivid and illustrative paintings, which not only makes those who expose their thoughts feel relaxed, but also allows visitors to find their own shadows in these diverse thoughts and receive education. At the same time, because it is self-criticism, there are no issues of whether the criticism is measured or consistent with the facts. Therefore, students all reflect: "Self-portraits, a feeling of ease."

　　This exhibition format is lively and vivid, truly a combination of pictures and text. People who visit feel deeply impressed and remember it for a long time.

　　自我画像　心情舒畅
    复旦大学历史系举办展览会
    本报讯　复旦大学历史系三年级的学生们于最近举办了批判资产阶级个人主义自我画像展览会。在展览会上，观众们面对着各式各样的自我画像，就可以看到形形色色的个人主义的嘴脸。大家认为，这样做有很多好处：首先是比较全面地、深刻地揭露了资产阶级个人主义，由于自己对自己是了解得最深刻，所以揭露的也就深刻。如有个学生为了有名有利，想在毕业后到法国去镀镀金，回国后，至少也是个副教授，但他又觉得这种想法不对头，连对自己的爱人都没有讲过，就在这次自我画像时，他全面系统地揭露了自己的个人主义思想，这种揭露也是深刻的。
    其次是人人受到深刻的教育，心情舒畅。凡是存在个人主义思想的学生，都把自己丑恶的思想挖掘出来，并用生动形象的画表现出来，不仅使暴露思想的人感到轻松，参观的人也从这些形形色色的思想中找到自己的影子，受到了教育。同时，由于是自己批判自己，这里没有批评是否掌握分寸、是否符合事实等问题存在。因此，学生们都反映：“自我画像，心情舒畅”。
    这样的展览形式是生动活泼的，真是图文并茂，参观的人看过后都觉得印象深刻，久久不忘。
