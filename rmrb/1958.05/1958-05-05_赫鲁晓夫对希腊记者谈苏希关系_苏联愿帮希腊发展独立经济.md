Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - TASS reported from Moscow on the 4th: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, stated in a conversation with Lambrakis, the publisher of Greek newspapers "Forum," "News," and "Messenger," that the most important issue in international politics is to allow everyone to live without war, to cooperate peacefully, regardless of the differences in the social systems and ideologies of various countries.

During the conversation, Khrushchev expressed his satisfaction with the current economic relations between Greece and the Soviet Union. He said that the trade volume between the Soviet Union and Greece has almost increased sixfold since 1953. He pointed out that the development of trade relations between the Soviet Union and Greece has not hindered Greece's trade with other countries at all.

Khrushchev also pointed out the possibility of further developing trade between the two countries. He said that if the Greek government also expresses corresponding concern, the Soviet Union is also willing to consider other forms of economic cooperation with Greece, which would promote Greece's industrialization and the development of its independent economy.

Khrushchev said that Greece's policy of joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has not brought any benefits to Greece in the past, nor will it bring any good prospects to Greece in the future. Because the heads of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have formulated a plan to establish American atomic and rocket bases in Greece, Greece faces a huge danger. Once a military conflict occurs, it may cause Greece to suffer an atomic counterattack, bringing tragic consequences to it. Khrushchev pointed out that Greece occupies an important position in the Balkans and the Eastern Mediterranean. Therefore, how the situation in this region will develop in the future largely depends on the position Greece takes on important international issues related to this region.

Khrushchev pointed out that Greece can play an important role in consolidating and developing comprehensive friendly ties between the peoples of the Balkan countries and turning this part of Europe into a real "peace zone." If Greece maintains a consistent and firm position on the issue of peaceful cooperation with all countries in the Mediterranean region, it will help enhance Greece's international prestige and at the same time contribute beneficially to creating an environment of tranquility and friendship in this region.

During the conversation, Lambrakis expressed that the Greek people are completely satisfied with the Soviet Union's position on the Cyprus issue. Regarding this issue, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has consistently advocated that the solution to the Cyprus issue should both conform to the interests of the residents of the island and help strengthen peace in the region. He said that we believe that if the United Nations does not want to protect colonialists, it should say something weighty in order to resolve the Cyprus issue on a truly democratic and just basis.

During the conversation, Khrushchev also talked about issues such as disarmament, stopping nuclear weapons tests, and summit meetings.

    赫鲁晓夫对希腊记者谈苏希关系
    苏联愿帮希腊发展独立经济
    新华社4日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科4日报道：苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在同希腊“论坛报”、“新闻报”、“信使报”等报纸的发行人朗布拉基斯谈话时说，国际政治中最主要的问题是让大家过没有战争的生活，和平合作，而不问各国的社会制度和意识形态有什么不同。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中对目前希腊和苏联两国之间的经济关系表示满意。他说，苏希之间的贸易额自1953年以来差不多增加了六倍。他指出，苏希之间贸易关系的发展根本没有妨碍希腊同其他国家的贸易。
    赫鲁晓夫还指出了进一步发展两国贸易的可能性。他说，如果希腊政府方面也表示相应的关心的话，苏联还愿意考虑同希腊进行其他形式的经济合作的问题，这种合作会促进希腊工业化和发展它的独立经济。
    赫鲁晓夫说，希腊执行的加入北大西洋集团的政策在过去没有给希腊带来任何好处，在将来也不会给希腊带来什么良好的前途。由于北大西洋集团首脑们制定了在希腊境内建立美国原子和火箭基地的计划，使得希腊面临着巨大危险，一旦发生军事冲突就可能使希腊遭到原子回击，给它带来悲惨的后果。赫鲁晓夫指出，希腊在巴尔干和东地中海地区居于重要地位。因此，这一地区的局势今后如何发展，在很大程度上要看希腊在与这一地区有关的重要国际问题上采取怎样的立场。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，希腊能够在巩固和发展巴尔干各国人民之间的全面友谊联系、把欧洲这部分地区变为真正的“和平地区”方面起重要的作用。希腊如果在地中海地区同一切国家和平合作问题上持一贯的坚定立场，那将有助于提高希腊的国际威望，同时也会对于在这个地区建立安宁和友谊的环境作出有益的贡献。
    在谈话中朗布拉基斯表示，希腊人民完全满意苏联在塞浦路斯问题上的立场。关于这个问题，赫鲁晓夫说，苏联过去和现在一贯主张塞浦路斯问题的解决既要符合这个岛的居民的利益，也要有助于加强这一地区的和平。他说，我们认为，如果联合国不想袒护殖民主义者，它就应该说句有分量的话，以便在真正民主和公正的基础上解决塞浦路斯问题。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈话中还谈到了裁军、停止试验核武器和最高级会议等问题。
