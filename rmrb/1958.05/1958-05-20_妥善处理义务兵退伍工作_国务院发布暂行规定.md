Xinhua News Agency, 19th — The first batch of conscripted soldiers, recruited on a trial basis according to the decision of the State Council in November 1954, have begun to be demobilized and return to their hometowns this year. At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of the "Military Service Law of the People's Republic of China," a certain number of conscripted soldiers will be demobilized every year in the future. In order to properly handle the various tasks after the demobilization of conscripted soldiers, the State Council issued provisional regulations on the handling of demobilization of conscripted soldiers to the People's Committees of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government on May 3. The regulations emphasize that conscripted soldiers, during their active service, have generally improved their political and ideological awareness through training and practice in the army, and are basically incorporated into militia organizations to serve in the reserve. They are a valuable force in defending the motherland and socialist construction. The army and local state organs must properly handle issues related to them when they leave the army and after their demobilization.

In addition to requiring the troops to handle all procedures and issue all due materials and sufficient travel and food expenses to get home in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of National Defense, providing material guarantees, the State Council's provisional regulations on the handling of demobilization of conscripted soldiers also require the troops to organize collective training for them, conduct education on socialism, patriotism, labor production, participation in militia organizations, reserve service, compliance with government laws and regulations, and the agricultural development program, and encourage them to maintain the glorious tradition of the People's Army.

Conscripted soldiers are generally recruited from certain production, work, or study positions. After demobilization, their original production, work, or study units generally still need them; and they can also easily play an active role in their original familiar production and work positions. Therefore, the provisional regulations stipulate that local state organs at all levels should handle the demobilization of conscripted soldiers in accordance with the principle of "coming from there and returning there." That is: those who were farmers living in rural areas or urban suburbs when they enlisted should return to their original residential areas to participate in agricultural production after demobilization; those who were formal staff members or workers of state organs, people's organizations, enterprises, institutions, etc. when they enlisted should be arranged to work by their original work units within two months if they request work after demobilization; those who were students (including secondary technical schools) who had not graduated when they enlisted should be allowed to resume their studies by their original schools at the beginning of the next semester after their demobilization if they request to continue their studies and meet the study conditions.

For those who did not have a fixed occupation when they enlisted in cities, or whose original occupation is no longer suitable for the needs of the state, the provisional regulations stipulate: labor departments at all levels should register them for employment after their demobilization and provide them with priority employment opportunities under the same conditions as the general public, or the local People's Committee should help them participate in agricultural production or other labor production. For specialized technical soldiers among the demobilized conscripted soldiers, local labor departments should give priority to employment based on the local need for technical personnel. Those technical personnel who cannot be arranged for employment temporarily should be mobilized to participate in agricultural production or other labor production, and then be given priority to be employed when technical personnel are needed in the future.

The provisional regulations require that when demobilized conscripted soldiers arrive in their residential areas, the county and city People's Committees should organize welcomes, introduce them to the local situation, care about their progress, conduct political and ideological education for them, improve their political awareness, and give play to their active role in socialist construction.

In addition, the provisional regulations have made clear provisions for the accommodation, treatment, and related expenses for conscripted soldiers who have contracted leprosy, mental illness, or other serious diseases during their active service after their demobilization.

The provisional regulations require conscripted soldiers to register for military service with the county and city military service organs in their residential areas with the military service certificate and military service registration form issued by the troops after their demobilization, and continue to serve in the reserve; and call on them to abide by government laws and regulations, unite with township and community cadres, contact the people, establish a concept of loving the country and the community, loving labor, and being diligent and thrifty in managing the household, and continuously improve their political awareness and play an active role in socialist construction after their demobilization.

　　妥善处理义务兵退伍工作
　　国务院发布暂行规定
    新华社19日讯　根据1954年11月国务院的决定试行征集的第一批义务兵，从今年开始已经陆续退伍还乡。同时，按照中华人民共和国兵役法的规定，今后每年都将有一定数量的义务兵退伍。为了妥善地处理义务兵退伍以后的各项工作，国务院在5月3日向各省、自治区、直辖市人民委员会发布了关于处理义务兵退伍的暂行规定。规定中强调指出，义务兵在服现役期间，经过部队的培养与锻炼，政治思想觉悟一般都有所提高，而且基本上都编入民兵组织服预备役，他们是保卫祖国和社会主义建设的一批可贵力量，军队和地方国家机关对于他们在退伍离开军队的时候和退伍以后的有关问题，必须予以妥善处理。
    国务院关于处理义务兵退伍的暂行规定中，除了要求部队对于退伍的义务兵应当按照国防部的规定办理一切手续和发给一切应发物资和足够到家的路费、伙食费等，给予物质保证以外，还要求部队在处理义务兵退伍的时候，应当对他们组织集训，进行社会主义、爱国主义和劳动生产、参加民兵组织、服预备役、遵守政府法令以及农业发展纲要等方面的教育，并勉励他们保持人民军队的光荣传统。
    义务兵一般都是在一定的生产、工作或者学习岗位上应征入伍的，退伍以后，原来的生产、工作或者学习单位一般都还需要他们；而他们也便于在自己原来所熟悉的生产、工作岗位上发挥积极作用。因此，暂行规定中确定，地方各级国家机关在处理义务兵退伍的时候，应当本着从那里来回那里去的原则进行处理。即：入伍时原是家居农村或者城市郊区的农民，退伍后都应当回到原居住地区参加农业生产；入伍时原是国家机关、人民团体、企业、事业等单位的正式职员或者工人，退伍后要求工作的，原工作单位应当在两个月内安排他们的工作；入伍时原是学校（包括中等技术学校）未毕业的学生，退伍后要求继续学习而本人又符合学习条件的，原学校应当在他们退伍后的下一学期开始时准予复学。
    对于入伍时家居城市没有固定职业，或者原来的职业已不适合国家需要的，暂行规定中确定：各级劳动部门在他们退伍以后应当予以就业登记，并在与一般群众同等条件下，给予优先就业的便利，或者由当地人民委员会帮助他们参加农业生产或者其他劳动生产。对于退伍义务兵中的专门技术兵，各地劳动部门应当根据本地需要技术人员的情况予以优先就业。对暂时不能安排就业的技术人员，应当动员他们参加农业生产或者其他劳动生产，待以后需要技术人员的时候再优先录用他们。
    暂行规定中要求，退伍的义务兵到达居住地区的时候，县、市人民委员会应当组织欢迎，向他们介绍当地情况，关心他们的进步，向他们进行政治思想教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，发挥他们在社会主义建设中的积极作用。
    此外，暂行规定中对于在服现役期间患得麻疯病、精神病以及其他严重疾病的义务兵，退伍以后的收容、治疗以及在这方面所需要的经费开支，都作了明确规定。
    暂行规定中要求义务兵在退伍以后，应当持部队发给的兵役证和兵役登记表到居住地区的县、市兵役机关办理兵役登记，继续服预备役；并且号召他们退伍以后遵守政府法令，团结乡社干部，联系人民群众，树立爱国爱社、热爱劳动和勤俭持家的观念，并不断地提高自己的政治觉悟，在社会主义建设中发挥积极作用。
