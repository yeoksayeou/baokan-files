    World's First Apomixis Laboratory for Plants

    The Soviet Union is building the world's first apomixis laboratory for plants. Its task is to cultivate plants that can both be hybridized and propagated using asexual methods to produce seeds. This was stated by Dubinin, Corresponding Academician of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and leader of scientific research on radiation experimental genetics, to a TASS correspondent. The scientist said that the task of experimenting with apomixis in crops such as corn and grains has never been proposed before, and it is of great significance to the national economy.

    世界第一座植物无融合生殖实验室
    苏联正在建设世界上第一座植物无融合生殖实验室，它的任务是培育一些既能杂交，又能用无性方法来繁殖种子的植物。这是苏联科学院通讯院士、辐射实验遗传学科学研究工作领导人杜比宁对塔斯社记者说的。这位科学家说，对玉蜀黍、谷类等农作物试验无融合生殖的任务，从来没有人提出过，它在国民经济上具有重大意义。
