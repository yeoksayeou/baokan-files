Xinhua News Agency, 4th. In order to strengthen the propaganda of Marxism theory and guide cadres in applying the principles of Marxism, to summarize the experiences of the Chinese revolutionary struggle and various practical works, the CCP committees of various provinces and cities are actively preparing theoretical publications.

The theoretical publication "Zhongzhou Review," prepared by the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, will be launched in June. The inaugural issue will include a foreword written by Wu Zhipu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China; Song Yuxi, Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Provincial Party Committee, wrote "The Significance of Studying the Book 'Course of Socialist Education'"; Wang Lizhi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Zhengzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, wrote "Confirming from Practice the Great Significance of the Party's General Line of 'Going All Out, Aiming High, and Achieving Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results'."

"Jiangxi Academic Journal," prepared by the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, will be published on July 1. The editorial board of this journal has been established, consisting of responsible comrades from the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, the Propaganda Department, the Intermediate Party School, and various universities in the province. In order to help and guide more than 50,000 cadres going to the countryside to study theory and current affairs policies, the Provincial Party Committee has also decided to publish the comprehensive publication "Cadres Going to the Countryside" in June.

In addition, the CCP Provincial Committees of Hunan, Fujian, Shandong, Liaoning, Shaanxi and other provinces are also preparing their own theoretical publications. The theoretical publication prepared by the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is scheduled to be published on July 1.

The CCP committees of various provinces emphasize that publications should implement the principles of "stressing the present over the past" and "integrating theory with practice." The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has determined that the editorial policy of theoretical publications is: focusing on the study of practical problems of the Chinese revolution, guided by the basic principles of Marxism. When the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently studied the work of "Jianghai Academic Journal," which was launched on March 1 this year, it pointed out that the content of this journal will focus on the following five aspects in the future:

(1) Essays that reflect major issues of universal significance in practical work or theory, and essays that reflect the thoughts of the times; (2) Relevant research on key issues in current political, ideological, industrial, agricultural, financial, literary, artistic, and educational work; (3) Opposing revisionism and dogmatism, and criticizing all kinds of bourgeois ideas; (4) The sorting out and introduction of ancient cultural heritage, but academic papers that conform to the principle of "stressing the present over the past"; (5) Typical investigation materials, academic reviews, and academic research trends related to current practical work.

    加强理论宣传　指导实际工作
    河南、江西等地省委筹办理论刊物
    新华社4日讯　为了加强马克思主义的理论宣传，指导干部运用马克思主义的原理，总结中国革命斗争和各项实际工作的经验，各省市中共党委正在积极筹办理论刊物。
    中共河南省委筹办的理论刊物“中州评论”将在六月份创刊。创刊号上将刊登中共河南省委书记处书记吴芝圃写的发刊词；省委宣传部部长宋玉玺写的“学习‘社会主义教育课程’一书的意义”；中共郑州市委书记处书记王黎之写的“从实践中证实党的总路线‘鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省’的伟大意义”等。
    中共江西省委筹办的“江西学刊”将于7月1日出版，这个刊物的编委会已经成立，由省委书记处、宣传部、中级党校和省内各高等学校负责同志组成。省委为了帮助和指导五万多名上山干部学习理论和时事政策，还决定在6月份出版“上山干部”综合性刊物。
    此外，湖南、福建、山东、辽宁、陕西等省中共省委也都在筹办自己的理论刊物。中共陕西省委筹办的理论刊物准备7月1日出刊。
    各省中共党委都很强调刊物应贯彻“厚今薄古”、“理论联系实际”的方针。中共辽宁省委确定理论刊物的编辑方针是：以研究中国革命实际问题为中心，以马克思主义的基本原则为指导。中共江苏省委最近研究今年3月1日创刊的“江海学刊”工作时，指出今后这个刊物的内容将侧重下述五个方面：
    （一）反映实际工作中或理论方面的重大的带有普遍意义问题的论文，反映时代思想的论文；（二）有关研究当前政治、思想、工业、农业、财经、文学、艺术、教育等工作中带有关键性的问题；（三）反对修正主义和教条主义，批判各种各样资产阶级思想；（四）关于古代文化遗产的整理与介绍，但符合“厚今薄古”原则的学术论文；（五）有关当前实际工作的典型调查材料、学术评论、学术研究动态等。
