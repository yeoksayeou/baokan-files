　　Pumping Water and Driving Vehicles, Lighting Lamps and Generating Electricity
    Hubei Builds Six Biogas Stations

    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, 13th dispatch) Hubei Province is utilizing biogas for pumping water, generating electricity, powering vehicles, lighting lamps, cooking, and boiling water, conducting experiments while focusing on popularization, and has already achieved results.

    In the Nanhu suburban area of Wuhan City, the first biogas pumping station officially started pumping water on May 1st. The internal combustion engine powered by biogas has replaced the commonly used diesel engine, drawing water from the low-lying Nanhu Lake to fields ten meters above the lake surface every day.

    The experiment of using biogas to drive vehicles, conducted jointly by the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry and Wuhan Oxygen Plant, has also been basically successful. The experimental results show that compressed biogas stored in bottles can not only drive vehicles, but also starts faster than when using gasoline, the machine noise is lower, and there is no odor in the car. Now, technicians are further studying the amount and patterns of biogas consumption when a fully loaded car runs on flat roads and climbs hills.

    In the vast rural areas of Hubei Province, counties have already started or are actively preparing to build biogas stations. Among them, Xiaogan, Huanggang, Jingzhou, Badong, and Hanchuan counties have already built five biogas stations and lit biogas lamps. The "May 3rd" Farm in Jingshan County is building a biogas power station, which will be able to supply electricity within May. Cadres of the Wuhan Municipal Planning Commission used their voluntary labor time to quickly build a biogas station, which is very convenient for cooking, boiling water, and stewing milk.

    The relevant leading departments of Hubei Province plan to build more than 180,000 medium and small-sized biogas power stations, biogas power stations, and biogas lighting stations in the province in the next three to five years to provide power for rural mechanization, semi-mechanization, and electrification; they plan to build more than 1,400 biogas compression stations to produce biogas fuel for rural tractors and heavy-duty vehicles. In order to adapt to the new situation of popularizing the use of biogas, technicians from the Hubei Provincial Department of Industry are cooperating with workers from the Wuhan Power Machinery Plant to modify the diesel engines commonly used in rural areas into internal combustion engines that can be driven by biogas; and have commissioned the Wuchang Construction Engineering School to produce biogas lamp heads, stoves, and cooking utensils in batches.

　　抽水又开车　点灯又发电
    湖北建成六座沼气站
    本报武汉13日电　湖北省利用沼气抽水、发电、发动汽车、点灯、煮饭、烧水，一边试验，一边重点推广，已经取得成效。
    在武汉市南湖郊区，第一座沼气抽水机站，已经在5月1日正式开始抽水。由沼气带动的内燃机代替了通常使用的柴油机，每天把低洼的南湖湖水哗哗地抽到高于湖水十公尺的田里。
    由湖北省工业厅和武汉制氧厂合作进行的利用沼气开动汽车的试验，也已经基本上成功了。试验的结果表明，压缩后装在瓶子里的沼气，不仅可以开动汽车，而且比使用汽油时发动快，机器的响声小，汽车内没有任何气味。现在，技术人员们正在进一步研究满载的汽车跑平路、爬山坡时消耗沼气的数量和规律。
    在湖北省广大农村，各县都已经在着手或积极筹备建设沼气站。其中孝感、黄冈、荆州、巴东、汉川等县，已经有五座沼气站建成，点上了沼气灯了。京山县“五三”农场正在建立一座沼气发电站，5月份内即可送电。武汉市计划委员会的机关干部利用义务劳动时间，很快建成了一个沼气站，煮饭、烧水、炖牛奶都很方便。
    湖北省有关领导部门，计划在今后三、五年内在全省建立十八万多座中、小型沼气发电站、沼气动力站和沼气照明站，为农村机械化、半机械化和电气化供给动力；计划建立一千四百多座沼气压缩站，为农村拖拉机和载重汽车生产沼气燃料。为了适应推广使用沼气的新形势，湖北省工业厅的技术人员正和武汉动力机厂的职工合作，将目前农村普遍使用的柴油机改制成可由沼气带动的内燃机；并委托武昌建筑工程学校成批生产沼气灯灯头、炉子和烧具。　（冯健）
