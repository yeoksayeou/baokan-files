Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 26th: Reports indicate that the area of the Lebanese people's uprising continues to expand. Sidon, an important southern port and the terminal of the Arabian-American Oil Company's (ARAMCO) pipeline, also witnessed street fighting between local insurgents and government forces on the 25th.

Meanwhile, in Tripoli, the main northern port, people's uprising forces, after fierce fighting with government troops, captured the Koulayat airport near Tripoli on the afternoon of the 25th.

According to Damascus Radio, the garrison in Aidin, near Tripoli, surrendered to the people's uprising forces on the 24th after fierce fighting, handing over all their weapons, including three tanks.

Damascus Radio stated that the Lebanese People's Army Command issued a warning on the 25th to those elements armed by the Lebanese authorities, demanding that they hand over their weapons to the People's Army within forty-eight hours. Shortly after the warning was issued, Abed Karmayesh, a leader of the National Socialist Party, surrendered to the people's uprising forces in Rachaya, southern Lebanon.

The radio station said that more people have joined the Lebanese movement against tyranny and imperialism.

At the same time, it is reported that the Lebanese cabinet, at a meeting presided over by President Chamoun on the 24th, decided to "dispatch troops to use all weapons" to suppress the domestic uprising. The cabinet also approved in principle the recruitment of "volunteers" from among citizens to strengthen the so-called security forces. According to the Middle East News Agency, these "volunteers" are in fact members of the fascist "National Socialist Party" and reactionary Phalange Party members.

According to reports, after the pro-Western government passed the resolution to suppress the uprising, the army immediately took large-scale military action against the insurgents, using all the weapons at its disposal. In addition to launching an offensive in the Akkar mountains northeast of Tripoli, deploying air force, artillery, and tanks, the military authorities issued an "ultimatum" to the uprising forces in the Baalbek region, Shouf, and Tripoli, threatening bombardment and demanding that the insurgents lay down their arms.

    黎巴嫩起义烽火蔓延到南部
    阿美石油公司油管终点西顿发生巷战
    亲西方政府采取大规模军事镇压行动
    据新华社大马士革26日电　据报道，黎巴嫩人民起义地区继续在扩大。南部重要港口、阿拉伯—美国石油公司输油管的终点西顿在25日也爆发了当地起义者和政府部队之间的巷战。
    同时在北部主要港口的黎波里，人民起义部队在同政府部队激战后，在25日下午又占领了的黎波里附近的库拉雅特机场。
    据大马士革电台报道，的黎波里附近艾丁的驻军24日在同人民起义部队激战以后，携带包括三辆坦克在内的全部武器向人民起义部队投降。
    据大马士革电台说，黎巴嫩人民军司令部在25日警告由黎巴嫩当局武装的那些分子，要他们在四十八小时内向人民军交出他们的武器。在警告公布以后不久，国家社会党的一个头目阿伯德·卡麦希就在黎巴嫩南部的拉希亚向人民起义部队投降。
    这家电台说，已有更多的人民参加了黎巴嫩的反对暴政和帝国主义的运动。
    同时，据报道，黎巴嫩内阁24日在总统夏蒙主持下举行的会议上已经决定“派遣军队使用一切武器”来镇压国内的起义。内阁同时在原则上允许在公民中间招募“志愿人员”以加强所谓保安力量。据中东通讯社报道，这种“志愿人员”实际上都是法西斯的“国家社会党”党徒和反动的长枪党党徒。
    据报道，在亲西方政府通过镇压起义的决议以后，军队立即对起义者采取了大规模的军事行动，使用了它所拥有的一切武器。除在的黎波里东北的阿卡尔山区展开的攻势中，出动空军、炮兵和坦克之外，军事当局向巴尔贝克地区舒弗和的黎波里地区的起义队伍提出“最后通牒”，“通牒”中用轰炸作威胁，要求起义者放下武器。
