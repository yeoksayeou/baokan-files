    New Air Battery Lamp
    The air battery lamp suitable for rural use, after being reformed by employees of the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative, has had its voltage increased from the previous three to six volts to ninety volts. It can now power a 100-watt light bulb for illumination and can also be used as a power source for DC radios, telephones, and amplifiers. Employees of the Liaoning Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative manufactured the air battery lamp a month ago. After the reform, its uses are greater and more widespread. It can provide household lighting, as well as lighting for fields and construction sites, and can be used to trap and kill pests. It can serve as a power source for radios, telephones, and amplifiers. It is not affected by wind and is safe and hygienic.

    适合于农村使用的空气电池灯，经过辽宁省供销合作社职工改制，电压由过去的三到六伏特提高到九十伏特，可以供一百度的灯泡照明，还可以作为直流收音机、电话机和扩音器的电源。辽宁省供销社职工在一个月以前就制成了空气电池灯。经过改制，它的用途更大更广泛，能供家庭照明，也可以作为田间、工地照明和诱杀害虫用，可以供收音机、电话机、扩音器作电源。它不怕风吹，而且安全卫生。
