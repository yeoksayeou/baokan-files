Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 16th: The Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued an appeal to the French working class and all French people regarding De Gaulle's statement.

The appeal pointed out that De Gaulle has taken off his mask. He has shown complete agreement with the saboteurs who rebelled against the Republic, shielded them, defended their rebellious acts, and demanded personal autocracy to establish a military dictatorship, ignoring the government just authorized by the National Assembly, the Constitution of the Republic, and the head of state.

The appeal stated that this is a blatant extension of the coup that took place in Algiers the day before to Paris, a blatant attempt to implement fascism in France in order to continue the war at all costs, deepen the poverty of workers, destroy democratic freedoms, and endanger the independence and national unity of the country.

The appeal said that in the face of the fascist threat, all workers and all democrats must unite to defeat any attempt to repeat the riots in Algiers in Paris. In order to block De Gaulle's path, to block the path of fascism and military dictatorship, the French people must unite, organize mass counterattacks in every enterprise, every city, and every district to deal with any fascist riots. Do not let the saboteurs take to the streets. Let everyone submit thousands of protests to the President of the Republic, demanding the defense of the Republic. Let everyone send delegations, hold strikes, and hold demonstrations. Let everyone organize now to crush any attempt at a coup.

Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Paris News: De Gaulle, who is supported by French fascist elements, openly came forward on the 15th and demanded to take over France's political power. The political situation in France is further sharpening.

In a brief written statement, De Gaulle openly stated that he was ready to come out and take charge of the Republic. He also believes that the parliamentary political system can no longer control the situation facing France.

The Communist Parliamentary Group of the French National Assembly issued a communiqué on the evening of the 15th, calling on all parliamentary groups in the parliament that support the republican regime to hold an emergency meeting to take measures to "block the road to military dictatorship and fascism." The communiqué pointed out that De Gaulle, after reaching a full agreement with the military generals who betrayed the Republic, is appearing as a candidate for military dictator. His statement is an extremely serious threat to the republican system and national sovereignty. The communiqué said that under these circumstances, the National Assembly should call on all those in the country who support the republican regime, regardless of political views, to rise up and counterattack the rioters to defend the democratic system and the sacred freedom of the nation. The National Assembly must also ask the government to take all necessary measures to defend the republican system.

At the same time as issuing the communiqué, the French Communist Party assured the new Prime Minister Pflimlin that they would give him full support in defending the republican system. Duclos, the chairman of the French Communist Parliamentary Group, and parliamentarians Vaillant-Couturier and Roger went to the Presidential Palace on the same night to meet with Coty in order to show him that the French Communist Party was ready to cooperate with other parties across the country to help defend the Republic.

"l'Humanité" also published a special issue late on the 15th. The banner headline on the first page was: "Fight for Peace, Against Disaster! Long Live the Republic! Do Not Let De Gaulle Come to Power! Workers of various tendencies who support the republican system unite, act, and organize to fight to crush all coup attempts!" In an editorial, "l'Humanité" called on all units, enterprises, cities, and districts to unite and organize the strength of the masses to counter any fascist activities. It also demanded that the working people constantly submit protests to the president, constantly send more delegations, and hold strikes and demonstrations in order to save the Republic and prevent De Gaulle from coming to power.

The Executive Committee of the French Socialist Party Parliamentary Group also issued a statement saying that the "riots of military and political personnel" in Algeria and De Gaulle's statement show that "the attack on the republican regime has begun." The statement called for "the broadest solidarity of all workers with all those who want to prevent France from falling into turmoil and dictatorship." The statement said, "The unity and action of democrats must produce a strong determination to defend freedom."

The French General Confederation of Labor called on workers in the national gas and electricity sectors to hold an anti-fascist "warning strike" and rally on the 16th.

The French cabinet held a special meeting on the evening of the 15th, presided over by Coty. After the meeting, Pflimlin announced that he would ask the parliament to approve a draft law declaring a state of emergency in mainland France. He said the proposed state of emergency would give authorities "greater power to deal with the situation."

The National Assembly has decided to hold a special meeting at 11:00 a.m. on the 16th. Speaker Le Troquer issued a notice asking members of the National Assembly to return to Paris as soon as possible to attend the meeting. The Paris garrison and all Paris police forces were ordered on the evening of the 15th to be ready to protect the parliament and the members of parliament attending the special session.

At the same time, Prime Minister Pflimlin's efforts to broaden the base of his government were met with a response from the Socialist Party. Socialist Party Secretary-General Mollet informed Pflimlin on the 15th that he had agreed to serve as Deputy Prime Minister and that the Socialist Party would cooperate with the government without reservation. Another right-wing "Independent Party" member, Pinay, who was invited by Pflimlin to serve as Deputy Prime Minister, has refused to participate in the government.

"Encouraged" by De Gaulle's statement, French fascist rioters in Algeria have decided to establish an all-Algeria "Committee of Public Safety" as a central organization. It is reported that in the past two or three days, no less than 150 so-called "Committees of Public Safety" have been established in various parts of Algeria and have taken over the administrative power of all major cities in Algeria.

On the 15th, fascist elements held two large rallies in front of the Algiers City Hall. De Gaulle's statement was read at the meeting. General Salan, commander-in-chief of the French colonial army stationed in Algeria, spoke at the rally. This officer, who was granted full power by the French president to maintain order in Algeria, took the same stance as the fascist elements and took the lead in shouting "Long Live De Gaulle" in his speech. He clamored to continue the Algerian war "until complete victory."

In many settlements in Algeria, colonialist bandits destroyed the houses of Algerian residents. In Oran, rebels broke into the provincial government building and drove away the administrator of Oran Province. The administrative organs of Sidi Bel Abbès were also destroyed.

According to a Reuters dispatch from Paris on the 15th, news from Algeria every hour reinforces the impression that the riots there were "long prepared and well organized." The dispatch said that people believe that the riots are directed and deployed by a few people in Paris (including some members of parliament who support De Gaulle). The fact that Chaban-Delmas, leader of the Social Republican Party (Gaullist), appeared in Algiers last week is believed to be closely related to the riots. The dispatch pointed out that Algiers rioted and established a "Committee of Public Safety" the day after Chaban-Delmas returned to Bordeaux, where he serves as mayor.

　　法共呼吁工人阶级和人民团结起来
　　堵塞军事独裁和法西斯道路
    戴高乐叫嚷要掌大权　法西斯分子更加猖狂
    新华社巴黎16日电　法国共产党中央委员会就戴高乐的声明向法国工人阶级和全体法国人民发出呼吁书。
    呼吁书指出，戴高乐已经拿下他的假面具。他已经表现了同结伙反叛共和国的破坏分子完全一致和包庇他们、为他们的叛乱行为辩护，同时要求个人专权，来建立军事独裁而无视国民议会刚刚授权的政府、无视共和国宪法和国家元首。
    呼吁书说，这是公然把前天在阿尔及尔发生的政变扩展到巴黎，公然试图在法国实行法西斯主义，以便不顾一切继续进行战争，加深劳动者的穷困处境、摧毁民主自由并危害国家的独立和全国统一。
    呼吁书说，面对着法西斯威胁，必须团结全体劳动者和所有民主分子，来挫败在巴黎重演阿尔及尔的暴乱行动的任何尝试。为了堵塞戴高乐的道路、堵塞法西斯和军事独裁的道路，法国人民必须团结起来，在每一个企业、每一个城市、每一个市区组织群众性反击来对付任何法西斯暴乱。不要让破坏分子走上街道。让大家向共和国总统呈递成千的抗议书，要求保卫共和国。让大家纷纷派遣代表团，举行罢工，举行示威。让大家从现在起就组织起来，把政变的任何尝试击溃。
    据新华社16日讯　巴黎消息：法国法西斯分子所拥戴的戴高乐已经在15日公开出面，要求接管法国的政治权力。法国的政治形势进一步趋于尖锐化。
    戴高乐在一项简短的书面声明中公然表示，他准备出来执掌共和国的大权。他还认为，议会政治制度已经不再能控制当前法国所面临的局势。
    法国国民议会共产党议会党团15日晚上发表公报，要求议会中所有拥护共和政体的议会党团举行紧急会议，以便采取措施来“堵塞军事独裁和法西斯的道路”。公报指出，戴高乐在同那些背叛了共和国的军事将领取得充分协议之后，正以一个候补军事独裁者的身份出现。他的声明是对共和制度和民族主权的极端严重的威胁。公报说，在这种情况下，国民议会应当号召全国所有拥护共和政体的人，不分政见，起来予暴乱者以反击，以保卫民主制度和民族的神圣自由。国民议会也必须要求政府采取一切必要的措施来保卫共和制度。
    在发表公报的同时，法国共产党向新总理弗林姆兰提出保证，他们将在保卫共和制度方面给予他完全的支持。法共议会党团主席杜克洛和议员瓦德克，罗歇同一天晚上还特地去总统府，要求见戈蒂，为的是向他表明法国共产党准备在全国各地同其他党派进行合作，帮助捍卫共和国。
    “人道报”也在15日深夜出版专号。第一版的通栏标题是：“争取和平、反对灾难！共和国万岁！不让戴高乐上台！各种倾向的拥护共和制度的劳动者团结起来、行动起来、组织起来，为粉碎一切发动政变的企图而斗争；”“人道报”在社论中号召各单位、各企业、各城市、各区团结起来，组织起群众的力量，以回击任何法西斯活动，它还要求劳动人民不断向总统提抗议，不断增派代表团和举行罢工和示威游行，以便拯救共和国，不让戴高乐上台。
    法国社会党议会党团执行委员会也发表声明说，阿尔及利亚的“军政人员的暴乱”和戴高乐的声明这两件事表明：“对共和政权的进攻已经开始了”。声明要求“全体工人同所有希望防止法国陷入骚乱和独裁局面的人建立最广泛的团结”。声明说，“民主人士的团结和行动一定能够产生保卫自由的强烈决心。”
    法国总工会在同一天号召全国煤气和电力部门的工人在16日举行反法西斯的“警告性罢工”和集会。
    法国内阁15日晚上在戈蒂主持下举行了特别会议。会后弗林姆兰宣布，他将要求议会批准一项法律草案，宣布法国本土处于紧急状态。他说，建议中的紧急状态将给予当局“更大的权力来应付局势”。
    国民议会已经决定在16日上午十一时举行特别会议。议长勒特罗盖发出通告，要求国民议会的议员们尽快赶回巴黎来开会。巴黎驻防军和全巴黎的警察部队已经在15日晚上接到命令，要他们随时作好准备，以保护议会和参加议会特别会议的议员们。
    在这同时，总理弗林姆兰寻求扩大政府基础的努力获得社会党的响应。社会党总书记摩勒15日通知弗林姆兰说，他同意出任副总理，并且表示社会党将同政府进行毫无保留的合作。另一个被弗林姆兰邀请担任副总理的右翼“独立党”人比内则已经拒绝参加政府。
    在戴高乐声明的“鼓舞”下，阿尔及利亚境内的法国法西斯暴乱分子已经决定成立全阿尔及利亚“救国委员会”作为中央机构。据报道，最近两三天来，阿尔及利亚各地已经先后成立了不下一百五十个所谓“救国委员会”，并且接管了阿尔及利亚所有主要城市的行政权。
    15日这一天，法西斯分子在阿尔及尔市政厅前先后举行了两次大集会。会上宣读了戴高乐的声明。驻阿尔及利亚法国殖民军总司令萨兰在集会上讲了话。这个被法国总统授予全权维持阿尔及利亚秩序的军官，和法西斯分子采取同样的立场，并且在讲话中带头高呼“戴高乐万岁”。他叫嚣要把阿尔及利亚战争继续下去，“直到取得完全胜利”。
    在阿尔及利亚的许多居民点，殖民主义者匪徒捣毁阿尔及利亚居民的房屋。在阿兰，叛乱分子闯入省政府大楼，把阿兰省行政长官赶走了。西迪倍尔阿卑斯市的行政机关也被捣毁。
    据路透社15日从巴黎发出的一条电讯说，每小时来自阿尔及利亚的消息都增强了这种印象，即：那里的暴乱活动是“经过长期准备和良好的组织的”。电讯说，人们以为这次暴乱是由在巴黎的少数人（其中包括某些支持戴高乐的议员）所指挥和调配的。社会共和党（戴高乐派）领袖沙邦—戴尔马上星期在阿尔及尔出现一事，据信同这次暴乱有密切关联。电讯指出，在沙邦—戴尔马返回他担任市长的波尔多市之后的第二天，阿尔及尔就发生了暴乱并且成立了“救国委员会”。
