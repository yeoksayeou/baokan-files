　　Good Experiences
    Some people say: It is very important to carry out grassroots sports activities, but it is difficult to actually do it, especially in units with poor conditions. Is this really the case? No. Today, this newspaper publishes the experience of the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory in carrying out sports activities, which is a very good answer.
    In terms of conditions, the conditions of the Wool Processing Factory are not good, but rather poor.
    The average age of the factory's more than 800 employees is 40 years old, and young workers account for only 13%; among the factory's more than 130 female workers, only six do not have children, and the rest are mothers of one to six children. In this case, it is more difficult to carry out sports activities than in other factories. However, because the factory regards carrying out employee sports activities and improving employee health as an important political task, and frequently conducts political and ideological work; and correctly implements the policy of following the mass line in carrying out sports activities; and implements the policy of first popularizing and then improving, and combining popularization with improvement, therefore, sports activities in the Wool Processing Factory are not only carried out, but also are in full swing.
    This fact shows that no matter how bad the conditions or how many difficulties there are, sports activities can still be carried out well. The problem is that we must truly attach importance to it ideologically, follow the mass line, and think of more ways.
    At present, sports work in various places is making great leaps forward, grassroots units are all moving, and the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in sports activities is very high. However, there is not much experience in various places on how to carry out grassroots sports activities well. The experience created by the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory in this regard can be promoted by various units according to their specific circumstances to carry out sports activities in their departments very well.

　　好经验
    有人说：开展基层体育活动非常重要，但是实际做起来有困难，特别是在一些条件差的单位。事实是不是这样呢？不是的。今天本报发表天津绒毛加工厂开展体育活动的经验，就是一个很好的回答。
    从条件来说，绒毛加工厂的条件不但不好，比起来还算是差一些的。
    全厂八百多职工的平均年龄是四十岁，青工只占13％多；全厂一百三十多名女工只有六个人没有小孩，其余的都是一个到六个孩子的母亲。在这种情况下，开展体育活动是要比其他工厂更困难。但是由于工厂把开展职工体育活动、改善职工健康状况当作一项重要政治任务，经常进行政治思想工作；并正确地贯彻了开展体育活动走群众路线的方针；贯彻了先普及后提高、普及与提高相结合的方针，因此，体育活动在绒毛加工厂不但搞起来了，而且还搞得热火朝天。
    这一事实说明了，不管条件多坏，困难多多，体育活动还是能搞得好的，问题在于要在思想上真正地重视起来，要走群众路线，多想办法。
    目前，各地的体育工作都在大跃进，基层单位都动起来了，群众要求参加体育活动的积极性很高。但是，怎样把基层体育活动开展得好，各地的经验还不多。天津绒毛加工厂在这方面所创造的经验，各单位可以根据具体情况加以推广，把本部门的体育活动很好地开展起来。
