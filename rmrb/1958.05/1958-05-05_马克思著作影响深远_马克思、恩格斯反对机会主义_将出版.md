Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Marxist works, illuminating the path of human liberation, are having an increasingly profound impact during China's current socialist revolution. According to preliminary statistics from the Publication Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Culture: from the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949 to the end of 1957, 71 kinds of Marx and Engels' works had been published nationwide, with a circulation of 4,752,000 copies. Among them, "The Communist Manifesto" circulated 630,000 copies, and "Das Kapital" circulated more than 430,000 copies. The book "Marx and Engels Against Opportunism" is also currently being published.

As early as before 1921, communist groups and advanced intellectuals in various parts of China began to introduce and disseminate Marxist doctrines through publications. In April 1920, the first Chinese full translation of "The Communist Manifesto" was published in Shanghai. After the founding of the Communist Party of China in 1921, Marxist theory began to be systematically introduced to China, and many relatively complete translated versions of Marx's works were published successively. The "People's Publishing House," established in Guangzhou on September 1, 1921, even drew up a plan to publish a "Complete Works of Marx" (fifteen types). Later, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing successively translated and published "The Communist Manifesto," "An Introduction to Das Kapital," "Wage Labour and Capital," "Value, Price and Profit," and "Critique of the Gotha Programme," among other books.

During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, despite extremely difficult material conditions and the serious threat of White Terror, twelve works by Marx were still translated and published, including "Das Kapital," "The Poverty of Philosophy," and "A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy."

After 1937, the entire Communist Party of China universally and deeply studied Marxist-Leninist theory. Yan'an and various liberated areas published a large number of Marxist-Leninist works, including "Marx and Engels on China," "Marx and Engels' Letters on Historical Materialism," "The Civil War in France," and "The German Ideology," works that had never been translated and published in China before.

From 1945 to 1949, during the Third Revolutionary Civil War, the publication and distribution of Marxist-Leninist classics expanded even further. In early 1949, in order to improve the Party's political and theoretical level and to welcome the victory of the people's revolutionary war across the country, the CPC Central Committee stipulated ten essential theoretical books for cadres to read, among which "The Communist Manifesto" was listed as the first essential book.

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, in order to systematically compile and publish Marxist-Leninist works, the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee was established in February 1953. It has successively published the first and second volumes of "The Complete Works of Marx and Engels." In the near future, the entire "Complete Works of Marx and Engels" will meet with Chinese readers.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th: The People's Publishing House will publish and distribute the book "Marx and Engels Against Opportunism" on May 10th. This book collects nine essays and thirty-seven letters by Marx and Engels on opposing opportunism, totaling approximately 100,000 words. It was compiled and translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee.

The essay section of "Marx and Engels Against Opportunism" includes "True Socialism," "Circular Against Kriege," "Critique of the Gotha Programme," and "Preface to the Second Edition of The Housing Question," among others. The letters section includes letters from Marx and Engels to the editorial board of "Sozialdemokrat," and letters from Marx to Engels and Marx to some proletarian revolutionary activists in various European countries at the time. In these essays and letters, Marx and Engels sharply and humorously refuted the opportunist viewpoints of Proudhon, Bakunin, Lassalle and other factions, which denied class struggle, abandoned the leadership of the proletarian party, and the methods of revolutionary struggle. They pointed out that opportunism is the manifestation of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in the workers' movement. It discourages the fighting spirit of the proletariat, paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working people, and is very harmful to the socialist movements of various countries.

The book "Lenin Against Revisionism," edited and published by the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the CPSU Central Committee, has been translated by the Compilation and Translation Bureau of the Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin of the CPC Central Committee and will also be distributed nationwide on May 10th.

    马克思著作影响深远
    “马克思、恩格斯反对机会主义”将出版
    新华社4日讯　照耀着人类解放道路的马克思主义著作，在目前中国社会主义革命时期发生着愈来愈深远的影响。据文化部出版事业管理局的初步统计：从1949年中华人民共和国建国时起到1957年底，全国出版的马克思、恩格斯著作已有七十一种，销行达四百七十五万二千册。其中“共产党宣言”销行达六十三万册，“资本论”销行了四十三万多册。最近还正在出版“马克思、恩格斯反对机会主义”一书。
    早在1921年以前，中国各地的共产主义小组和先进的知识分子就开始通过刊物介绍和传播马克思主义学说，1920年4月在上海第一次出版了“共产党宣言”的中文全译本。1921年中国共产党成立以后，马克思主义理论便开始被系统地介绍到中国来，陆续出版了许多比较完整的马克思著作的译本。1921年9月1日在广州成立的“人民出版社”，曾订出了出版“马克思全书”（十五种）的计划。以后，广州、上海、北京相继翻译出版了“共产党宣言”、“资本论入门”、“工资劳动与资本”、“价值价格与利润”、“哥达纲领批判”等书。
    第二次国内革命战争时期，虽处于物质条件极端困难和白色恐怖严重威胁的情况下，仍翻译出版了十二种马克思的著作，其中有“资本论”、“哲学的贫困”、“政治经济学批判”等。
    1937年以后，中国共产党全党普遍深入地学习马克思列宁主义理论，延安及各解放区大量地出版了马列主义著作，其中包括“马克思恩格斯论中国”、“马克思恩格斯关于唯物史观的书信”、“法兰西内战”、“德意志意识形态”等从未在中国翻译出版过的著作。
    从1945—1949年的第三次国内革命战争时期，马列主义经典著作的出版发行更加扩展了。1949年初，中共中央为提高党的政治理论水平、迎接人民革命战争在全国范围内的胜利，规定了十种干部必读的理论书籍，其中“共产党宣言”列为第一本必读的书籍。
    中华人民共和国建国以后，为了系统地编译出版马列主义著作，在1953年2月成立了中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局，已先后出版了“马克思恩格斯全集”第一、二卷。不久的将来，全部“马克思恩格斯全集”将和中国的读者们见面。
    新华社4日讯　人民出版社将在5月10日出版发行“马克思、恩格斯反对机会主义”一书。这本书搜集了马克思、恩格斯有关反对机会主义的九篇论文和三十七篇通信，约十几万字，是中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局编译的。
    “马克思、恩格斯反对机会主义”一书的论文部分，有“真正的社会主义”、“反对克利格的通报”、“哥达纲领批判”和“论住宅问题序言”等；书信部分有马克思、恩格斯致“社会民主党人”编辑部、马克思致恩格斯及马克思致当时欧洲各国一些无产阶级革命活动家的书信。在这些论文和书信中，马克思和恩格斯尖锐而幽默地驳斥了普鲁东、巴枯宁、拉萨尔等派别否认阶级斗争、放弃无产阶级政党的领导和革命的斗争方法等机会主义观点，指出机会主义是资产阶级和小资产阶级思想在工人运动中的表现，它沮丧无产阶级的斗志、麻痹劳动人民的革命意志，对于各国社会主义运动的危害性很大。
    苏共马列主义研究院编辑出版的“列宁反对修正主义”一书，已由中共中央马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林著作编译局译出，也将在5月10日向全国各地发行。
