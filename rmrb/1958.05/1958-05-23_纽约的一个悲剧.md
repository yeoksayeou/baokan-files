    A Tragedy in New York

    With the continuous development of the economic crisis, the poverty and disaster of the American working class are also deepening. In the wave of unemployment, colored workers are the first to suffer severe blows. The tragedy of the suicide of unemployed worker Rodriquez in New York, reported by the American "Worker's Weekly," reflects the disaster faced by 600,000 Puerto Ricans in New York City.

    Rodriquez was thirty-seven years old. He and his wife, Clementina, both worked in New York and lived on 15th Street in New York. In early March, Clementina was laid off. On March 14, Rodriquez also lost his job. The factory owner told him, "Things are not good. You don't have to come to work starting Monday. I don't know when I can tell you to resume work."

    Rodriquez withdrew his only ten dollars in savings from the bank and borrowed another five dollars from others. When he handed the fifteen dollars in weekly rent to the landlady, he said to her, "Now both my wife and I are unemployed!"

    On the day the tragedy occurred, Rodriquez was very silent. He sat in the room smoking. There were only a few dilapidated chairs in the room. He only had a few cigarettes left. Rodriquez said to his wife, "I have no way out. It's better to die than to live."

    Clementina went out to visit a friend, hoping to find a temporary job. When she returned, she found Rodriquez had hanged himself from the gas pipe. Clementina was terrified. She screamed and ran to the kitchen, took a knife and cut the rope. But Rodriquez had already died. Clementina was overwhelmed with grief and cut herself with the knife. Fortunately, neighbors who heard the noise rushed over and took the knife from her, and Clementina's suicide was not realized.

    People found a small black leather bag in Rodriquez's room. This was the Rodriquez couple's money bag. There were six cents in the bag. This was the only property the Rodriquez couple had!

    纽约的一个悲剧
    随着经济危机不断发展，美国工人阶级的贫困和灾难也日益深重。在失业的浪潮里，有色人种工人首先遭受严重的打击。美国“工人周报”报道的纽约失业工人罗德里格自杀的悲剧，反映了纽约城六十万名波多黎各人面临的灾难。
    罗德里格，三十七岁。他和他的妻子克列门丁娜都在纽约做工，住在纽约第十五号街。3月初，克列门丁娜被解雇。3月14日，罗德里格也失了业。工厂老板对他说：“情形不好了。从星期一起你就不必来上班。我不知道哪一天可以告诉你恢复工作。”
    罗德里格从银行里取出了仅有的十元存款，又向别人挪借了五元。当他把每周必须缴付的房租十五元交给房东太太的时候，他向房东太太说：“现在我同我的妻子都失业了！”
    悲剧发生的那一天，罗德里格十分沉默。他坐在房间里吸香烟。房间里只有几张破烂的椅子。他的香烟也只剩下最后的几支。罗德里格对他的妻子说：“我已经毫无办法了，不如死去还干脆些。”
    克列门丁娜出去探望一个朋友，希望找到一件临时工作。当他回来的时候，她发现罗德里格已经在煤气管那里上吊自杀了。克列门丁娜惊惧欲绝，她狂叫了一声就奔到厨房里，拿了一柄刀把绳子割断。但是罗德里格早已气绝。克列门丁娜痛不欲生，用刀向自己砍去，幸亏闻声赶来的邻人把她的刀夺去，克列门丁娜的自杀才没有实现。
    人们在罗德里格房间里发现了一个黑色小皮包。这是罗德里格夫妇的钱袋。钱袋里有六分钱。这就是罗德里格夫妇仅有的财产！
