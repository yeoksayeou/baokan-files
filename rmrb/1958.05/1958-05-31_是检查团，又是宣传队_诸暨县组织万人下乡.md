Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 29th. After studying and discussing the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the Zhuji County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Zhejiang Province decided to immediately organize a ten-thousand-person agricultural production inspection to transmit the spirit of the conference to all cadres and masses in the county as quickly as possible through the method of learning, thinking, speaking, and doing, and to make the light of the general line of socialist construction a driving force for current production and various tasks.

Sun Zifu, Secretary of the Zhuji County Committee of the Communist Party of China and alternate representative of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, returned to the county from Beijing on the morning of the 26th after attending the meeting. In the afternoon, he convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the County Party Committee, and on the 27th, he held an emergency enlarged meeting of the County Party Committee to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and, according to the requirements of the general line of socialist construction, summarized and inspected the work of the entire county. Everyone agreed that under the guidance of the general line, great achievements had been made in the county's work in the past six months. The County Party Committee further discussed specific measures to implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and decided to organize a ten-thousand-person agricultural production inspection starting on the 29th to quickly convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and to promote the advanced experiences from all parts of the country learned from the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to all parts of the county as quickly as possible. This inspection requires that every township and every cooperative in the county be reached and inspected.

Currently, Zhuji County is using various propaganda tools to carry out a large-scale propaganda campaign to publicize the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the general line of socialist construction. More than 500,000 farmers in the county have been greatly encouraged. On the evenings of the 27th and 28th, more than 70,000 agricultural cooperative members in the county piled up more than 3.8 million dan of fertilizer overnight. They proposed to accumulate 300 dan of fertilizer per person within seven days to welcome the inspection team. In the past two days, a campaign to eliminate third-class seedlings has been launched in all townships throughout the county. The cooperative members carried out a rush weeding and topdressing in more than 70,000 mu of third-class rice seedling fields.

    是检查团，又是宣传队
    诸暨县组织万人下乡
    新华社杭州29日电　中共浙江省诸暨县委在学习和讨论中共八大二次会议的文件以后，决定立即组织万人农业生产大检查，以边学边想边说边干的方法，最快地把会议精神传达到全县干部和群众中去，使社会主义建设总路线的光芒成为推动当前生产和各项工作的动力。
    中共诸暨县委书记、中共八大候补代表孙子甫26日上午从北京开会回县后，下午就召开县委常委会，27日又召开紧急县委扩大会议，传达八大二次会议精神，并根据社会主义建设总路线的要求，总结和检查了全县的工作。大家一致认为，在总路线指导下，半年来全县工作已获得很大成就。县委进一步讨论了贯彻八大二次会议精神的具体措施，决定从29日开始组织一次万人农业生产大检查，迅速传达八大二次会议精神，并且把从八大二次会议上学习来的全国各地的先进经验最快地推广到全县各地。这次检查，要求全县每个乡、每个社都传达到，检查到。
    目前，诸暨县各地正在应用各种宣传工具开展声势浩大的宣传运动，宣传中共八大二次会议的文件，宣传社会主义建设总路线。全县五十多万农民受到很大鼓舞。27、28两日晚上，全县有七万多农业社员连夜堆积了三百八十多万担肥料，他们提出要在七天内每人积肥三百担来迎接检查团。两天来，全县各乡都掀起了消灭三类苗的运动，社员们在七万多亩水稻三类苗田里突击耘了一遍田，追了一遍肥。
