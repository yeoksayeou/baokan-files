    Heaven's Wrath and Popular Resentment
    The South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique recently held a military exercise near the Vietnamese military demarcation line. American military advisors also came out to participate in the command. However, as a result of the South Vietnamese troops being forced to conduct exercises under the scorching sun, many people fell ill or were injured, and some even died. In the 48th Regiment of the 16th Light Infantry Division alone, there were sixty officers and soldiers who were ill, injured, or dead. This situation aroused strong dissatisfaction among the officers and soldiers. The South Vietnamese authorities had to end this exercise hastily ahead of schedule.
    Originally, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique and its American advisors wanted to use this exercise to create a Cold War atmosphere, but Heaven did not cooperate, and the scorching sun was relentlessly hot. The officers and soldiers, unwilling to die in the Cold War, were also greatly dissatisfied. This truly reached the point of "Heaven's wrath and popular resentment."

    天怒人怨
    南越吴庭艳集团最近在越南军事分界线附近举行了一次军事演习。美国军事顾问也出来参加了指挥。可是结果由于南越军队被迫在炎热的太阳下进行演习，许多人患病或者受伤，还有一些人死亡，仅在第十六轻装师第四十八团，患病、受伤和死亡的官兵就有六十人。这种情况引起官兵们的强烈不满。南越当局不得不把这次演习提前草草收场。
    本来吴庭艳集团和它的美国顾问们是想利用这次演习来制造冷战的，可是天公不作美，偏偏炎阳如火，而官兵们由于不甘心死于冷战也大为不满，这真是弄到了“天怒人怨”的地步。
