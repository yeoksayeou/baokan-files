Xinhua News Agency, Zhejiang, 6th: Since the beginning of spring, in the East China Sea, Japanese fishing vessels have repeatedly violated the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, intruding into our prohibited fishing zones,ramming and damaging fishing boats and gear belonging to our fishing production cooperatives, and drowning our fishermen, causing serious destructive incidents. This has caused immense losses to our fishermen, and seriously disrupted and affected the fishing production and safety of our coastal fishermen.

According to preliminary investigations, from March 15th to May 1st alone, more than 170 Japanese fishing vessels intruded into our prohibited fishing zones, causing as many as thirteen destructive incidents. For example: On March 15th and 16th, Japanese fishing vessels intruded near Yangqi, dragging away 1,330 baskets of fishing tackle belonging to the Dongsheng and Xinyang fishing cooperatives of Wenling County, and damaging two of our fishing boats; on March 24th and 25th, in the waters southeast of General Mao by six or seven nautical miles off Yang'an, more than ten invading Japanese fishing vessels destroyed one large pair of fishing nets each belonging to the Dayang and Jinqing fishing cooperatives of Shengsi County, and attempted to tow away our fishing boats with iron cables, but fortunately our fishermen cut the cables and escaped the danger; on April 9th, the Japanese fishing vessel "Shoowa Maru" intruded near Pishan of Yuhuan County, damaging part of our fishing nets; on April 16th, the Japanese fishing vessel "Nikko Maru No. 5" dragged away more than ten sets of fishing baskets belonging to the Yingdong Fishing Cooperative near Pishan of Yuhuan County; even more seriously, at 11:30 AM on May 1st, near Pishan of Yuhuan County, five pairs of Japanese double-trawlers, including "Ake Maru No. 155" and "Mishima Maru," and three single-trawlers intruded into our prohibited fishing zone to fish, dragging away more than 300 baskets of fishing gear, during which "Ake Maru" rammed head-on into our small fishing boats, damaging one small fishing boat belonging to Chen Xiliang of the Kanmen Town Democratic Fishing Cooperative, and drowning cooperative member Xu Shunlai.

The circumstances of the incidents fully demonstrate that the nature of the Japanese actions is a blatant violation of the Fisheries Agreement. Large Japanese motorized trawlers barged into our small fishing fleets in the prohibited fishing zone, ramming and damaging our fishermen's boats and gear, and insulting our fishermen with wooden boards and broken rubber shoes. When intruding into the prohibited fishing zone, some Japanese fishing vessels concealed their vessel numbers, while others secretly approached our coast at night and engaged in activities such as using binoculars to scout our coastal situation and take photographs. When incidents occurred, our relevant departments sent production guidance vessels carrying the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement to negotiate, but the Japanese side was arrogant and completely ignored them.

Xinhua News Agency, 6th: The China Fisheries Association sent a telegram to the Tokyo Japan-China Fisheries Council, protesting the illegal actions of Japanese fishing vessels intruding into our prohibited fishing zones, destroying our fishermen's nets, and damaging our fishing boats. The protest telegram is as follows: To Mr. Tsunejiro Hiratsuka, Chairman of the Tokyo Japan-China Fisheries Council:

Recently, your fishing vessels have repeatedly intruded into our prohibited fishing zones, destroying our fishermen's nets and damaging our fishing boats, seriously threatening the production and safety of our coastal fishermen. On April 9th of this year, the Japanese fishing vessel "Shoowa Maru" damaged part of our fishing nets. On April 16th, "Nikko Maru No. 5" dragged away more than ten sets of fishing baskets belonging to our Yingdong Fishing Cooperative at the Pishan 15-fathom water area in the Zhejiang sea. At 11:30 AM on May 1st, "Ake Maru No. 155" damaged one small fishing boat belonging to Chen Xiliang of the Kanmen Town Democratic Fishing Cooperative in the waters off Pishan, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, causing fisherman Xu Shunlai to fall into the water and drown, and also dragging away fishing gear. In addition, similar damage incidents are too numerous to mention in detail. The actions of your fishing vessels in violating the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement have aroused the anger of the Chinese fishing masses, and our association is extremely regretful. We hereby send a telegram to protest, demanding that your side stop similar incidents from happening again with Japanese fishing vessels, and compensate our fishermen for all the losses they have suffered.

    日本渔轮连续侵犯我禁渔区
    我国渔业协会提出严重抗议
    新华社6日讯　浙江消息：自入春以来，在我东海面上，连续发生日本渔轮违犯中日渔业协定，侵入我禁渔区，撞坏我渔业生产合作社的渔船、渔具，淹死我渔民严重破坏事件。使我渔民遭受莫大损失，严重地破坏和影响了我沿海渔民的渔业生产和安全。
    据初步了解，自3月15日至5月1日，即有日本渔轮一百七十余艘侵入我禁渔区，造成破坏事件达十三次之多。例如：3月15、16日日本渔轮侵入洋岐附近，拖走温岭县东升、新洋等渔业社捕鱼钓具一千三百三十篮，碰坏我渔船二只；3月24日、25日，在洋鞍海面将军帽东南六、七浬处，日本渔轮入侵十余艘，捣毁嵊泗县大洋和金清两渔业社的大对渔网各一顶，并用铁索缚住我渔船企图拖走，幸被我渔民将铁索砍断才摆脱了危境；4月9日日渔轮“昌和丸”侵入我玉环县披山附近，撞坏我渔网一部；4月16日，日渔轮“日兴丸五号”在玉环县披山附近，拖走我鹰东渔业社捕渔筐十多套；更严重地是5月1日上午十一时半，在玉环县披山附近有日渔轮“有明丸一五五号”、
  “美岛丸”等双拖轮五双，单拖轮三只侵入我禁渔区捕鱼，拖走绲三百多篮，其中“有明丸”竟面对我小渔船横冲直撞，撞坏我坎门镇民主渔业社陈细良小钓船一只，社员徐顺来落水淹死。
    事件发生的经过情况，充分地说明了日方的行为的性质是公然破坏渔业协定。日本大队机拖渔轮侵入禁渔区的我小钓船队中横冲直撞，碰坏我渔民的渔船、渔具，并用木板、破胶鞋辱打我渔民。日方渔轮在侵入禁渔区时，有的将船号掩盖起来，有的在夜间偷偷驶近我海岸活动，并且用望远镜侦察我海岸情况，拍照等。当事件发生时，我有关单位曾派生产指导船携带中日渔业协定前往交涉，但日方态度蛮横，根本置之不理。
    新华社6日讯　中国渔业协会致电东京日中渔业协议会，抗议日本渔轮侵入我国禁渔区，捣毁我方渔民的渔网，撞坏我方渔船的不法行为。抗议电如下：东京日中渔业协议会会长平冢常次郎先生：
    近来贵方渔轮屡次侵入我禁渔区，捣毁我方渔民的渔网，撞坏我方渔船，严重地威胁了我国沿海渔民的生产和安全。本年4月9日日本渔轮“昌和丸”破坏我渔网一部分。4月16日“日兴丸五号”在浙江海面坡山十五托水处，拖走我鹰东渔业社捕筐十多套。5月1日上午十一时三十分“有明丸一五五号”在浙江省玉环县披山洋面撞坏我坎门镇民主渔业社陈细良小钓鱼船一只，致使渔民徐顺来落水淹死，并且拖走渔具。此外，类似损害事件不及细述。贵方渔轮破坏中日渔业协定的行为，引起中国渔民群众的愤怒，我会极为遗憾。现在特电提出抗议，要求贵方制止日本渔轮再有类似事件发生，并且要赔偿我方渔民所受的一切损失。
