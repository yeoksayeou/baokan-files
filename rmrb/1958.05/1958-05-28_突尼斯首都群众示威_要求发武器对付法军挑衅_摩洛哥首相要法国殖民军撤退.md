Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, 27th: Several thousand people in the Tunisian capital held demonstrations on the 26th, demanding the immediate and complete withdrawal of French troops and the distribution of weapons to counter their provocations.

On the same day, Tunisian President Bourguiba announced that Tunisia had decided to once again bring the provocative incidents by French troops stationed in Tunisia to the United Nations Security Council.

In a radio address to the nation, Bourguiba said that Tunisia was "in a state of war or close to a state of war." He denounced the collusion between French troops stationed in Tunisia and French rebels in Algeria.

Xinhua News Agency, Rabat, 27th: According to an official Moroccan communique, Prime Minister Belafrej summoned the French Ambassador on the morning of the 26th and reiterated the demand for the withdrawal of French troops from Morocco, particularly the immediate withdrawal of French troops from eastern Morocco, close to Algeria.

According to French military sources, France currently has 30,000 army personnel and 15,000 air force personnel stationed in Morocco. The army is mainly stationed in the eastern region of Morocco. After the fascist riots in Algeria, the Moroccan government requested the French government to withdraw troops from the east.
