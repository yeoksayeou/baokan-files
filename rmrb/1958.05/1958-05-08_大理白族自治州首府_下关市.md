    Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture Capital - Xiaguan City
    Nestled at the foot of the Cangshan Mountains, where the altitude reaches 4,000 meters and the clouds perpetually linger, and on the shores of the highland lake, Erhai, lies a vibrant small city on a suddenly opening alluvial plain. This is Xiaguan City, the capital of Yunnan Province's Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture.
    In the Tang Dynasty, Xiaguan was called Longwei Pass (Dragon Tail Pass). It stood to the south, opposite Shangguan (Dragon Head Pass) at the winding end of the Cangshan Mountains. Leaning on the Cangshan Mountains and bordering Erhai Lake, it was a natural strategic point in ancient times. From the 8th to the 13th centuries, the Nanzhao Kingdom and the Dali Kingdom relied on this natural stronghold to establish their kingdoms for more than 500 years. In the Qing Dynasty, Du Wenxiu, a Hui Muslim leader who rebelled against ethnic oppression, resisted the Qing troops here for as long as eighteen years. At the end of the Tang Dynasty's Tianbao era, Prime Minister Yang Guozhong sent 200,000 troops to oppress and plunder the ethnic minorities here, but they were repeatedly defeated. To this day, Xiaguan City still has the "Ten Thousand Graves" of soldiers who died in the Tang Tianbao battles, and the famous Nanzhao Stele, located seven or eight li from Xiaguan, which narrates the entire war.
    Xiaguan is not only a witness to the history of ethnic oppression but also an ancient city of ethnic friendship. From the Han Dynasty onwards, Han Chinese culture from the Central Plains gradually entered this region. From the 8th to the 12th centuries, Xiaguan was one of the relay stations on the route to India and Burma. It had close political, economic, and cultural ties with Southeast Asian countries, becoming a gateway for cultural exchange between our country and Southeast Asian countries at that time. Today, Xiaguan is the political, economic, and cultural center of the autonomous prefecture and remains a transportation hub in western Yunnan. From Xiaguan, the China-Burma Highway leads through Baoshan, Mangshi, and Wanting to friendly Myanmar. To the north, the Yunnan-Tibet Highway leads through Lijiang, Zhongdian, and other places to Tibet. To the southwest, the highway leads to the Lincang area, where the majority of China's Kawa people live. There is also Erhai Lake shipping, which connects five counties within the autonomous prefecture, including Dali, Binchuan, and Eryuan. This comprehensive land and water transportation network makes Xiaguan a distribution center for materials in western Yunnan. More than a dozen passenger buses and dozens of large ships depart from Xiaguan every day. More than 600 trucks travel across the country transporting goods. Every year, two to three thousand tons of non-staple foods, such as Erhai bow fish, Heqing ham, Yangbi walnut kernels, and Binchuan cotton and pears, are transported from here to Kunming, Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places. At the same time, large quantities of building materials, pesticides, agricultural machinery, mechanical equipment, newspapers, and magazines are also transported from various places.
    Xiaguan is a place of beautiful scenery and many scenic spots and historical sites. In early spring, when the north is still frozen for thousands of miles, camellias and azaleas are already in full bloom in Xiaguan. Since liberation, department stores, hostels, cinemas, and workers' clubs have been newly built in the urban area. Gravel roads have been replaced with smooth and bright asphalt roads. In the suburbs, on the green fields, stand the office buildings of the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee, teachers' colleges, hospitals, oil mills, tea factories, and other buildings. Since liberation, a total of more than 120,000 square meters of buildings have been newly built, exceeding the area of the original houses in the ancient city.
    In recent years, 22 new factories have been built successively in the city. These include grain processing plants, oil mills, farm tool factories, automobile repair plants, and the Xiaguan Tea Factory, which makes pressed tea for the people of Tibet. A contingent of ethnic minority workers has also been formed. These factories produce more than 200 kinds of products, and last year's industrial output value increased more than threefold compared to 1952. With the arrival of the leap forward situation, the city will also build 17 major factories and mines this year, including machine factories, chemical factories, fertilizer factories, and synthetic oil factories, with a total output value expected to increase more than eightfold compared to last year. Xiaguan will become an industrial city supporting the autonomous prefecture's great leap forward in agriculture.
    This small city, with a population of only more than 40,000, has many health institutions such as the prefectural hospital, the municipal hospital, the health and epidemic prevention station, and the plague prevention institute. Infectious diseases such as plague, malaria, cholera, and smallpox, which once made citizens tremble with fear, are now under control. Recently, the people of the city have all been engaged in the struggle to eliminate the five pests (flies, mosquitoes, sparrows, rats, and snails). New comprehensive middle schools, agricultural technology schools, teachers' colleges, and agricultural cooperative cadre schools have also been built here.

### 大理白族自治州首府——下关市

    大理白族自治州首府——下关市
    在海拔四千公尺终日云雾缭绕的苍山麓下，高原湖泊洱海之滨，豁然开朗的冲积平原上，有一座气象万千的小城，这就是云南省大理白族自治州首府下关市。
    下关在唐代叫龙尾关，与蜿蜒苍山之端的上关即龙首关，并峙南北，依苍山、傍洱海，古时即为天险。从第八到十三世纪的南诏国和大理国，依此天险建国五百多年。清代，起义反抗民族压迫的回民领袖杜文秀，曾在这里和清兵对抗了十八年之久。唐天宝末，宰相杨国忠曾前后派二十万人压迫和掠夺这里的少数民族，但都被打得大败亏输。到现在下关市还有唐天宝战亡士卒的万人冢，和距下关七、八里处的叙述战争始末的著名的南诏碑。
    下关不仅是民族压迫的历史见证者，更是民族友好的古城。从汉代起，中原的汉族文化就逐渐输入这个地区。八世纪到十二世纪时，下关是通往印、缅要道的驿站之一。它和东南亚各国在政治、经济和文化上有密切连系，成为我国当时对东南亚各国文化交流的一个门户。现在，下关是自治州政治、经济和文化的中心，并且依然是云南西部的交通枢纽。从下关沿中缅公路经保山、芒市、畹町，可通达友邦缅甸。从北沿滇藏公路经丽江、中甸等地，可到西藏。从西南行，公路可通我国佧佤人主要聚居区的临沧地区。还有洱海航运，可以连系自治州内大理、宾川、洱源等五个县。这种四通八达的水陆交通网，使下关成为滇西的物资集散地。每天，从下关要开出十多辆客车，几十艘大船。有六百多辆货车在各地奔驰运货。每年，从这里运出二、三千吨副食品，如洱海弓鱼、鹤庆火腿、漾濞的核桃仁、宾川的棉花和雪梨等著名产品到昆明、上海、武汉等地。同时，也从各地运来大批建筑材料、农药农械、机械设备、报刊杂志。
    下关，是风景优美、名胜古迹很多的地方。初春，当北方还是千里冰封时，下关就已经盛开着山茶花和映山红了。解放后，市区新建起百货商店、旅舍、电影院、工人俱乐部。碎石路已改为光滑明净的柏油路。郊外，在碧绿的田野上，矗立起自治州人民委员会办公大楼、师范学校、医院、榨油厂、茶厂等建筑物。解放后共新建了十二万多平方公尺面积的建筑物，超过古城原有的房屋面积数。
    几年来，全市陆续新建了二十二个工厂。其中有粮食加工厂、榨油厂、农具厂、汽车修配厂和为西藏人民制紧茶的下关茶厂等。并形成一支少数民族的工人队伍。这些工厂的产品有两百多种，去年的工业产值比1952年增加三倍多。随着跃进形势的到来，全市今年还要兴建机器厂、化工厂、化肥厂、人造石油厂等十七个主要厂矿，总产值要比去年激增八倍多。下关将成为支援自治州农业大跃进的工业城市。
    这个仅有四万多人口的小城，却拥有州医院、市医院、卫生防疫站、鼠疫防治所等许多卫生机构。那些曾经使市民谈虎色变的鼠疫、疟疾、霍乱、天花等传染病，现在已得到控制。最近，全市人民都投入除五害（苍蝇、蚊、雀、鼠、钉螺）的斗争。这里还新建起完全中学、农业技术学校、师范学校、农业合作干部学校等。
