　　Silent Indictment
　　She is a woman from Atlanta, Georgia, USA, the wife of worker Carter, and the mother of five children. Not long ago, the Carter family became unemployed. Having failed to pay the rent within the seven-day grace period, they were ruthlessly evicted by the landlord.
　　From this photograph, people see the sorrow of this unemployed worker's wife, and at the same time, they are reminded of the misfortune of the millions of American women who have the same experience. (Originally published in the Soviet "Labor News")

　　无声的控诉
    她是美国佐治亚州亚特兰大市的一个妇女，工人卡尔特的妻子，五个孩子的母亲。不久以前，卡尔特一家失业了，过了限期七天还没有钱交上房租，就被房东毫不留情地赶了出来。
    从这张照片上，人们看到了这个失业工人的妻子的愁苦，同时也联想到和她遭遇相同的千万个美国妇女的不幸。（原载苏联“劳动报”）
