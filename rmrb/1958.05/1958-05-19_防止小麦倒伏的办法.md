Ways to Prevent Wheat Lodging
    Zhu Pirong

This year, wheat is growing particularly well in many places, presenting a scene of abundant harvests. However, in some wheat fields, due to vigorous growth, there is a tendency for the stalks to lodge. Based on past experience, the possibility of wheat lodging increases as it approaches the later stages of growth, especially under the influence of wind and rain. Therefore, preventing wheat lodging is still an important task to ensure a bumper wheat harvest.

Many regions have summarized and promoted some experiences from the masses in this year's work to prevent wheat lodging.

Increasing the application of potash fertilizer (such as grass ash) can make wheat stalks grow stronger. Combining weeding or watering with earthing-up can consolidate the base of the wheat plants and enhance their ability to resist lodging. Appropriately controlling soil moisture, watering less or not at all when it is not dry or when there is wind; in irrigation areas or places with high groundwater levels, the amount of irrigation can be appropriately reduced. In rainy areas, good drainage work should be done. These methods, which start from cultivation, can still be used in areas where the wheat growing season is later.

In addition, there are several artificial methods to prevent lodging:

    (1) The method of erecting poles and pulling ropes. That is, erecting poles and driving stakes around the rows and ridges, and then pulling ropes to support the wheat plants and prevent lodging. This method has been used in some places such as Shaanxi and Henan, and has had some effect. Some places also use the method of erecting aerial nets, using square-shaped rope nets to block the wheat plants that are about to fall.

    (2) The method of bundling with ropes. Bundle the wheat plants that may lodge together. However, the bundles should not be too large or too tight, to prevent the middle ears of wheat from being affected. The bundling place should not be too high either.

    (3) For wheat plants that have lodged after rain, after sunny days, use poles or ropes to gently sweep off rainwater or dew along the rows, reducing the weight of the upper part, and then use ropes to support them.

During a strong wind on May 10th, many townships in Yanshi County, Henan Province, mobilized a large number of commune members to brave the wind and rain to support the lodging wheat fields. Yuetan Agricultural Cooperative collected 1,200 zhang of various ropes and more than 14,000 poles in one day, and tied up more than 250 mu of wheat fields in one afternoon.

### 防止小麦倒伏的办法

　　防止小麦倒伏的办法
    朱丕荣
    今年许多地方小麦生长特别好，呈现了一片丰收的景象。但是部分麦田，由于生长茂盛，茎秆有倒伏的趋势。根据以往的经验，在风雨影响下，小麦越到生长后期，倒伏的可能性越大。因此，防止小麦倒伏仍是当前保证小麦丰产丰收的一项重要的工作。
    许多地区在今年的防止小麦倒伏工作中，总结和推广了一些来自群众中的经验。
    增施钾肥（如草木灰），可以使小麦茎秆长得坚实。结合锄地或浇水后进行培土，可以巩固麦株基部，增强抵抗倒伏的能力。适当控制土壤水分，在不旱或有风时，可以少浇或不浇；在灌溉区或地下水位高的地方，可适当减少灌水量。在多雨的地方，要做好清沟排渍工作。这些从栽培上着手的方法，在小麦生长季节较晚的地区还可以采用。
    此外，还有几种人工防止倒伏的办法：
    （一）立秆拉绳的办法。就是在行、畦的周围，立杆打桩，再拉绊绳子，拦扶麦株，防止倒伏。在陕西、河南等一些地方都采用过这个办法，并有一定效果。有的地方还采用架空中网的办法，用方格形的绳网来拦住欲倒的麦株。
    （二）用绳捆的办法。把可能倒伏的麦株，成束地围捆起来。但束捆不宜过大、过紧，以防中间麦穗受到影响。捆束的地方也不要过上。
    （三）对于雨后倒伏的麦株，晴天后可用杆子或绳子轻轻顺行拂落雨水或露水，减轻上部的重量，然后用绳子拦扶。
    河南省偃师县在5月10日的一次大风中，许多乡都出动了大批的社员，冒着风雨拦扶将倒伏的麦田。岳滩农业社一天中就收集了各种绳子一千二百丈，杆子一万四千多根，一个下午就绑架了麦田二百五十多亩。
