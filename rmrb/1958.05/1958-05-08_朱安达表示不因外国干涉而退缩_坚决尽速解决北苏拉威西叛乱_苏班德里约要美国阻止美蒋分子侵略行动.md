Xinhua News Agency reports: Indonesian Prime Minister Juanda told reporters on the 7th that the Indonesian government is determined to resolve the North Sulawesi rebellion quickly and will not back down due to foreign interference "from any side."

Juanda mentioned that he had maintained formal contact with several Asian and African countries, urging them to pay attention to the issue of foreign interference in Indonesia. He said he personally was also prepared to write letters to the Prime Ministers of some Asian and African countries.

According to Antara News Agency: Prime Minister Juanda said on the 6th that because government troops had recovered Bukittinggi in West Sumatra, the central government could now concentrate its military forces to resolve the rebel group in North Sulawesi.

On the 5th, Prime Minister Juanda summoned the American Ambassador to Indonesia, Howard Jones. He spoke to Jones about the issue of foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. Prior to this, Indonesian Foreign Minister Subandrio summoned the American Ambassador on the 3rd, pointing out to him in detail the facts of the attacks on Indonesia by Americans and Chiang Kai-shek clique elements, and warned that if the United States did not stop these aggressive actions against Indonesia, the Indonesian government would submit the issue to the United Nations.

Indonesian Army Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Piangadi firmly denied on the evening of the 6th the rumors spread by Western newspapers that Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution was preparing to hold negotiations with the rebel group. Piangadi pointed out that this was a deliberate distortion of the facts by certain foreign newspapers with ulterior motives.

Indonesian military authorities had announced that the Army Chief of Staff had sent some officers to meet with Kavilarang, the former Indonesian Military Attaché to the United States Embassy, in order to make this officer, who was involved with the rebel group, aware of his responsibility. Foreign newspapers deliberately distorted this news to mean that the Army Chief of Staff was preparing to negotiate with the rebel group.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 7th: Sumual, one of the heads of the North Sulawesi rebel group in Indonesia, issued a statement on Manado Radio on the 6th, saying that the "capital" of the "revolutionary government" had been moved from Bukittinggi in West Sumatra to Manado in North Sulawesi on May 5th, and that Warouw, the former Indonesian Military Attaché to the Chinese Embassy, would lead the Manado "government."

Public Prosecutor Baweanannean, who escaped from Manado, told a reporter from the "Indonesian Torch" newspaper that there were American and Chiang Kai-shek clique military instructors with the rebels in Manado, as well as many weapons shipped in from abroad, including rocket launchers, anti-aircraft guns, and artillery.

    苏班德里约要美国阻止美蒋分子侵略行动
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：印度尼西亚总理朱安达7日告诉报界说，印度尼西亚政府将坚决尽速解决北苏拉威西的叛乱，而且决不会因为“来自任何方面”的外国干涉而退缩。
    朱安达提到，他曾经同好些亚非国家保持正式接触，敦请它们注意外国干涉印度尼西亚的问题。他说他个人还准备写信给一些亚非国家的总理。
    据安塔拉通讯社报道：朱安达总理6日说，由于政府军已经收复了西苏门答腊的武吉丁宜，中央政府现在可以集中它的军事力量来解决北苏拉威西的叛乱集团。
    在5日，朱安达总理召见了美国驻印度尼西亚大使霍华德·琼斯。他对琼斯谈到外国干涉印度尼西亚内政问题。在这以前，印度尼西亚外交部长苏班德里约在3日召见美国大使，向他详细指出了美国人和蒋介石集团分子对印度尼西亚袭击的事实，并且警告说，如果美国不阻止这些侵略印度尼西亚的行动的话，印度尼西亚政府将把这个问题提交联合国。
    印度尼西亚陆军发言人皮恩加迪中校在6日晚上坚决否认西方报纸散布的关于印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安准备同叛乱集团举行谈判的消息。皮恩加迪指出，这是某些别有用心的外国报纸在故意歪曲事实。
    印度尼西亚军事当局曾经宣布，陆军参谋长派过一些军官去同前印度尼西亚驻美国大使馆武官卡维拉朗会谈，以便使这个同叛乱集团有牵扯的军官认识他的责任。外国报纸故意把这则消息歪曲为陆军参谋长准备同叛乱集团谈判。
    新华社雅加达7日电　印度尼西亚北苏拉威西叛乱集团的头子之一苏穆阿尔6日在万鸦老电台发表声明说，“革命政府”的“首都”已经在5月5日从西苏门答腊的武吉丁宜移到北苏拉威西的万鸦老，前印度尼西亚驻中国大使馆武官瓦罗将要领导万鸦老“政府”。
    从万鸦老逃出来的检察官巴韦南内安对“印度尼西亚火炬报”记者说，在万鸦老的叛乱分子那里有美国和蒋介石集团的军事教官，还有从外国运来的许多武器，其中包括火箭炮、高射炮和大炮等。
