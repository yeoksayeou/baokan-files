    "Planting Rice Under the Sun, Harvesting Wheat Under the Moon"
    Hong'an Farmers Rush to Summer Harvest and Planting

    (Our Wuhan, May 29th dispatch) Reporter Tian Zhuang reports: After studying the Party's general line for socialist construction, the broad masses of farmers in Hong'an County, Hubei Province, the famous old revolutionary base area, have been even more encouraged by their revolutionary vigor. They are striving to fundamentally change the original appearance of the place, which has suffered severe damage and devastation for a long time, within two or three years, and to rapidly turn it into an advanced socialist new countryside.

    The heroic people of Hong'an County, who have been tested through long revolutionary struggles, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals as soon as possible, recently, after repeated discussions, revised their planned targets, increasing the average yield per mu of grain and oil crops (mainly peanuts) from 1,000 jin to 1,200 jin. They are also striving to become a "thousand-jin wheat county" next year. They have decided to continue to exert great effort, and with the spirit of "continuous revolution," to earnestly implement the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results in one go. At present, all 700-plus agricultural cooperatives in the county are studying the general line while criticizing and overcoming conservative ideas, thereby pushing the production upsurge that has been going on for more than half a year towards a new peak.

    Last year, this county created the miracle of increased production in every cooperative and bumper harvests in everything. It reached the grain production targets of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule. This year, more than 100,000 mu of summer crops have generally achieved a bumper harvest, with an expected increase of more than 80% compared to last year, and more than half of the townships have increased production by more than 100%.

    Currently, from the mountains to the plains, from the plains to the hills, everywhere in Hong'an County is a busy and tense scene. Two hundred thousand people across the county are working day and night to carry out the summer harvest and planting. Their slogan is: "Planting rice under the sun, harvesting wheat under the moon, working non-stop in wind and rain." In just the two nights of the 26th and 27th, the county harvested more than 60,000 mu of wheat. At the same time, the county has also rushed to plant more than 100,000 mu of mid-season rice, and is now starting to plant late rice. More than 44,000 mu of peanuts have also been weeded twice. In order to strive for a greater autumn harvest, the county is continuing to carry out a manure accumulation campaign. People have decided to accumulate another 20 million dan of fertilizer on the basis of completing the fertilizer accumulation task. In the past two days, in order to kill rice stem borers, more than 50,000 lamps have been deployed every night throughout the county. Many townships and cooperatives have put forward the slogan: "Stars in the sky, red lights on the ground, if stem borers are not eliminated, we will resolutely not retreat." According to statistics, more than 3 million stem borers have been killed in the past two days alone. In addition, while rushing to harvest wheat, all cooperatives are generally conducting bumper harvest summaries and actively carrying out seed selection activities to prepare for achieving a thousand jin per mu of wheat next year.

    总路线鼓舞农民艰苦奋战　用革命速度提高农业生产
    “太阳底下插秧，月亮底下割麦”
    红安农民突击夏收夏种
    本报武汉29日电　记者田庄报道：全国著名的革命老根据地湖北省红安县的广大农民，学习了党的社会主义建设总路线以后，更加鼓舞了革命干劲，力争两、三年内根本改变原来的面貌，使这个长期遭受严重破坏、摧残的地方，迅速地成为先进的社会主义新农村。
    久经革命锻炼的英雄的红安县人民，为了早日达到上述目标，最近，经过反复讨论，修改了自己的规划指标，把原来粮食、油料（主要是花生）两项作物平均亩产一千斤增加到一千二百斤。并且力争明年成为“小麦千斤县”。他们决定继续鼓足干劲，以“不断革命”的精神，一鼓作气地认真贯彻党关于多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。目前，全县七百多个农业社正在一面学习总路线，一面批判、克服保守思想，从而使已经持续大半年的生产高潮，更迈向新的高峰。
    去年，这个县曾经创造了社社增产，样样丰收的奇迹。提前达到了全国农业发展纲要修正草案粮食产量指标。今年十万多亩夏收作物普遍丰收，预计比去年增产80％以上，半数以上的乡增产都在一倍以上。
    目前，红安县从山区到平原，从平原到丘陵，到处是一片忙碌的紧张景象。全县二十万人正夜以继日地进行夏收夏种。他们的口号是：“太阳底下插秧，月亮底下割麦，风里雨里不停工”。仅26日、27日两个夜晚，全县就割了小麦六万多亩。和这同时，全县还突击插完了十几万亩中稻，现在正开始晚稻插秧，四万四千多亩花生也已普遍除了两遍草。为了争取秋季更大丰收，全县正在继续开展积肥运动。人们决定在已完成积肥任务的基础上，再积肥二千万担。这两天，为了捕杀螟蛾，全县每天夜晚出动五万多盏灯，许多乡、社提出的口号是：“天上有星星，地下有红灯，螟蛾不消灭，坚决不收兵”。据统计，仅最近两天就捕杀螟蛾三百多万只。此外，各社在与抢收小麦的同时，正普遍进行丰产总结，并且积极开展选种活动，为明年亩产小麦千斤做好准备。
