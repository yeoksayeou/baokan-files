The Anhui Provincial Department of Agriculture issued an urgent notice to all special districts and counties in mid-May regarding several methods for preventing wheat rust disease. The notice pointed out that recently, in various regions, in addition to using lime-sulfur mixture spraying, and methods such as ditching and drainage, and applying dry soil manure to reduce field humidity, people have also created methods such as using wood ash water and lime water, which have very good prevention effects. The notice also introduced the following four methods:

　　(1) Ten catties of wood ash are mixed with one hundred catties of water. After dissolving, filter out the ash residue and spray with a sprayer, limited to wetting the leaves and stems. This can both control the development of rust disease and increase the potassium fertilizer nutrients for the wheat.

　　(2) Five catties of lime are mixed with one hundred catties of water. After dissolving, spray about three hundred catties per mu, which can not only inhibit the development of the bacteria but also eliminate the original bacteria spots.

　　(3) One catty of table salt is mixed with one hundred catties of water, and two to three hundred catties are sprayed per mu, which can prevent the germination of disease spores, with good results.

　　(4) Fifty catties of the wild grass "mouse-ear chickweed" are used per mu, plus three to four hundred catties of water to soak for three or four days (to speed up the soaking, warm water can be added), and then the juice is used for spraying, which has a significant effect in killing bacteria (it can also prevent scab).

　　安徽农业厅推荐防治小麦锈病的办法
    猫儿眼草治锈病效果很好
    本报讯　安徽省农业厅在5月中旬向各专区、县发出关于防治小麦锈病几个办法的紧急通知。通知指出：最近各地防治小麦锈病，除采用石灰硫磺合剂喷射，及开沟排水、施用干土粪降低田间湿度等办法外，还创造了使用草木灰水、石灰水等，防治效果很好。通知并介绍了下面四种办法：
    （一）草木灰十斤兑水一百斤，溶化以后，滤去灰渣，用喷雾器喷射，以喷湿叶秆为限。既能控制锈病发展，又能增加麦子的钾肥养分。
    （二）石灰五斤兑水一百斤，溶解后，每亩喷射三百斤左右，不仅能抑制病菌发展，而且能消灭原有病菌斑点。
    （三）食盐一斤兑水一百斤，每亩喷射二三百斤，制止病孢子发芽，效果良好。
    （四）每亩用野草“猫儿眼”五十斤，加水三、四百斤沤三、四天（要沤得快，可加温水沤），然后用汁液喷射，杀灭病菌有显著效果（也可以防治赤霉病）。
