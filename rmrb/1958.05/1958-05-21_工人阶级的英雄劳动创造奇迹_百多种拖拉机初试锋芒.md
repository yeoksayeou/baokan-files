Xinhua News Agency, 20th dispatch: In the first five months of this year, the Chinese working class has used its heroic labor to manufacture the first batch of tractors in Chinese history. To date, more than 120 types of tractors have been trial-produced in various locations. Last winter, China did not have a single self-made tractor. In just a few months, tractor manufacturing has blossomed everywhere. Now, whether in the interior or in remote Xinjiang, Yunnan, or the Inner Mongolian grasslands, whether in large factories or small and medium-sized factories, all are trial-producing tractors. Tractor manufacturing is no longer a mysterious affair.

Among these tractors, 37 have been exhibited at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition and have been widely welcomed by the audience. Tractors with brands such as "Yalu River," "Songhua River," "Ganjin" (Full Steam Ahead), and "August 1st" performed plowing demonstrations on the land of the August 1st Agricultural Cooperative in Wali Township, Beijing suburbs, on the 19th. Beijing agricultural machinery experts who visited the demonstration believed that these tractors had good plowing quality. The "August 1st" brand universal diesel tractor (26 horsepower) from Nanchang Machinery Factory and the "Songhua River No. 2" diesel tractor (25 horsepower) from Harbin Songjiang Machinery Factory both had high tillage efficiency, capable of plowing more than 40 mu of land per shift (ten hours). The "Yalu River No. 1" diesel tractor (30 horsepower) from Andong Machinery Factory could plow up to 60 mu of land per shift. In particular, the Luoyang brand small (16 horsepower) gas tractor from the First Tractor Manufacturing Plant, when pulling a double-wheel double-furrow plow, could plow more than 40 mu of land per shift.

The tractors that have now been manufactured in various places are all made according to the needs of different regions and different crops in our country. Most of them can perform a variety of operations, and their designs are also very beautiful. The first batch of tractors produced includes those with rubber tires, iron wheels, and tracks, and those powered by kerosene, diesel, gasoline, gas, and steam. Therefore, some are suitable for plains and wasteland, some are suitable for mountains, gardens, and paddy fields, and some can be used for both dry and wet land. Almost one-third of the 30-odd tractors exhibited this time are amphibious. The common feature of these tractors is that they are versatile and can perform more than ten types of general operations, and many can perform up to fifty types. The "August 1st" brand (Jiangxi) universal tractor can perform field operations such as plowing, harrowing, sowing, cultivating, weeding, fertilizing, and harvesting, as well as generate electricity, pump water, irrigate, saw wood, extract oil, mill rice, and serve as a transportation tool. The "August 1st" brand (Jiangxi) and "Ronglian" brand (Sichuan) tractors, due to their light bodies and flexible operation, can be used in paddy fields by removing the rubber tires and replacing them with iron wheels, creating good conditions for the mechanization of paddy fields in our country. The largest tractor participating in this exhibition is 40 horsepower, and the smallest is 1.5 horsepower. The 1.5 horsepower Yuncheng (Shanxi) hand-held tractor is small and exquisite, and can plow eight fen of land per hour, making it a good tool for cultivating mountains, terraces, and gardens.

Among the first batch of tractors manufactured in our country, many are named with names like "Leap Forward," "Full Steam Ahead," and "Satellite," which explain to people the reasons for their creation, and their creation has also powerfully shattered the mysterious views of some people on manufacturing tractors. Among the more than 100 types of tractors that have been trial-produced in our country, most of them, except for a very few trial-produced by regular tractor factories, are trial-produced by local machinery factories, auto repair shops, agricultural tool factories, and iron factories. It shows people that small and medium-sized factories with simple equipment can trial-produce tractors, and that it is possible to trial-produce tractors without formal drawings and professional engineering and technical personnel. In the future, the manufacture of tractors in our country will not only rely on regular tractor manufacturing plants, but also be particularly inseparable from these small and medium-sized factories. The speed of production has also broken the usual practice of tractor manufacturing, and many tractors have been made in twenty days to a little over a month. In order to support the great leap forward in agricultural production, according to incomplete statistics from more than 20 provinces and cities, the total number of tractors planned for trial production this year has reached more than 10,000.

    工人阶级的英雄劳动创造奇迹
    百多种拖拉机初试锋芒
    新华社20日讯　在今年的头五个月里，中国工人阶级以自己的英雄劳动制造出中国历史上第一批拖拉机。到目前为止，各地试制出厂的拖拉机已经有一百二十多种。去年冬天我国还没有一台自己制造的拖拉机，仅仅几个月的功夫，拖拉机的制造已是遍地开花了，现在不论内地还是边远的新疆、云南以及内蒙古草原，不论大工厂还是中小工厂，都在试制拖拉机。拖拉机的制造再不是什么神秘的事了。
    在这些拖拉机中，已有三十七种在全国农具展览会上展出，普遍受到了观众的欢迎。“鸭绿江”“松花江”“干劲”“八一”等牌拖拉机，19日在北京郊区洼里乡八一农业社的土地上进行了耕地表演。参观这次表演的北京农业机械专家们认为，这些拖拉机耕地质量良好。南昌机械厂的“八一”牌万能柴油拖拉机（二十六马力）和哈尔滨松江机械厂的“松花江二号”柴油拖拉机（二十五马力）耕作效率都很高，每班（十小时）可耕地四十亩以上，安东机械厂的“鸭绿江一号”柴油拖拉机（三十马力）每班耕地可达六十亩以上。特别是第一拖拉机制造厂的洛阳牌小型（十六马力）煤气拖拉机，牵引双台双轮双铧犁，每班耕地还可达四十亩以上。
    各地现在已制成的拖拉机，都是根据我国不同地区不同作物的需要制作的。大多能进行多种作业，式样也很美观。第一批出厂的拖拉机中，有胶轮、铁轮、链轨的，有煤油、柴油、汽油和煤气、蒸气的。因此有的适于平原、荒地，有的适于山地、园田和水田，也有的水旱地通用，这次展出的三十几种拖拉机，水旱两用的几乎占三分之一。这些拖拉机的共同特点，是万能式通用的，一般作业种类达十种以上，多的可达五十种。“八一”牌（江西）万能拖拉机，除可以进行耕地、耙地、播种、中耕、除草、施肥、收获等田间作业外，还可发电、抽水、灌溉、锯木、榨油、碾米以及做为运输的工具等。“八一”牌（江西）和“蓉联”牌（四川）等拖拉机，由于机车体轻，运转灵敏，卸去胶轮换上铁轮就可以下水田，为我国水田机械化创造了良好的条件。参加这次展出的拖拉机的最大一台是四十马力，最小的一台是一马力半。一马力半的运城（山西）手扶拖拉机，小巧玲珑，每小时可耕八分地，是山地、梯田、园田耕耘的好工具。
    在我国制造的第一批拖拉机中，不少是以“跃进”“干劲’“卫星”等命名的，它向人们说明了它们产生的原因，而它们的产生也有力地粉碎了有些人在制造拖拉机上的神秘观点。我国已试制的一百多种拖拉机中，除极少数是正规的拖拉机厂试制的外，大多是各地机械厂、汽车修配厂、农具厂和铁工厂等试造的，它向人们表明：设备简陋的中小工厂可以试制拖拉机，没有正规的图纸和专业的工程技术人员也可以试制拖拉机，将来我国制造拖拉机不仅需要依靠正规的拖拉机制造厂，也特别离不开这些中小工厂。在制作的速度上也打破了一般拖拉机制造的惯例，不少拖拉机都在二十天到一个多月的时间里制成的。为了支援农业生产大跃进，目前据二十多个省市的不完全统计，今年计划试制的拖拉机总数已经达到一万台以上。
