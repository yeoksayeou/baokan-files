During the Great Leap Forward, the rural market in Sichuan has taken on a completely new look. Financial and trade workers are trying every possible means to facilitate farmers and save their time.

　　Night-time Business Department

　　In order to facilitate farmers' purchases, the Hujia Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Longchang County has opened a night-time comprehensive business department, supplying oil, salt, wine, tobacco, matches, and other commodities from 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm. Such night-time business departments are available in rural areas throughout Sichuan, and farmers no longer have to worry about not being able to buy things at night.

　　Banking Services Delivered to the Door

　　In rural areas, the phenomenon of queuing to withdraw and deposit money has been basically eliminated. The Baihe Township Credit Cooperative in Kai County has broken with convention and set up a service station in the agricultural cooperative and three agency stations, simplifying savings and loan procedures, facilitating the masses, and encouraging members to actively save their surplus money.

　　Day and Night Purchasing

　　Now is the season when rapeseed is being put on the market one after another, and the grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives in various places are purchasing it around the clock. In Xindu, Chongqing, Luxian and other places where rapeseed was put on the market earlier, the supply and marketing cooperatives have changed from "waiting for goods to come to the door" to going down to the cooperatives to inspect grades, designating fixed points for sales and purchasing at the door with scales and money, and making appointments for delivery. Some supply and marketing cooperative cadres also help agricultural cooperatives to harvest and thresh rapeseed, which further increases the enthusiasm of farmers to sell rapeseed.

　　The Cooperative Now Has a Pig Market

　　The commercial department of Liangfeng Township in Wanxian County has opened a pig market in the agricultural cooperative. Half of the thirty agricultural cooperatives in the township now buy and sell pigs in their own cooperatives, which is very convenient for the members to buy and sell pigs.

　　Cooked Food to the Countryside

　　The time for rushing to plant early rice is the busiest time for farmers, but farmers don't have to go to the market to buy various commodities. In order to allow farmers to eat cooked food during the busy farming season, the comrades of the food service industry in Aiguo Township, Neijiang County, deliver steamed pork, braised dishes, etc. to the countryside for sale. The supply and marketing cooperative in this township also organized more than 20 peddlers to deliver the daily necessities needed by farmers to their doorsteps.

　　农忙一刻值千金　财贸人员下农村
    在大跃进中，四川农村市场气象一新。财贸工作者们千方百计地想办法便利农民，节省他们的时间。
    夜间营业部
    隆昌县胡家镇供销社为了便利农民买货，开设了夜间综合营业部，从下午六时半到九时半供应油、盐、酒、水烟、火柴等商品。像这样的夜间营业部，在四川各地农村都有，农民再也不愁晚上买不到东西了。
    银行上门
    在农村里，排队取款、存款的现象已经基本消除。开县白鹤乡信用社打破常规，在农业社设立一个服务站、三个代办站，简化了储蓄贷款手续，方便了群众，社员有余钱都踊跃储蓄。
    日夜收购
    现在正是油菜籽陆续上市的季节，各地基层供销社都是不分日夜，随到随收。油菜籽上市较早的新都、崇庆、泸县等地，供销社把过去“等货上门”变为下社验级，定点交售和带秤带钱登门收购，约时送交的作法。有的供销社干部还帮助农业社收割、打晒菜籽，农民出售油菜籽的积极性更高了。
    社里有了猪市场
    万县凉风乡商业部门在农业社里开辟了猪市场。全乡三十个农业社，已有半数在本社买猪卖猪，社员们买猪卖猪非常方便。
    熟食下乡
    抢栽早稻的时候，是农民最忙的时候，但是农民们不用赶场，也能买到各种商品。内江县爱国乡食品服务业的同志，为了让农民们在农忙时期吃到熟食，他们把蒸好的扣肉、卤菜等送到农村去卖。这个乡的供销社还组织了二十多个货郎担，把农民需要的日常生活用品送上门去。
