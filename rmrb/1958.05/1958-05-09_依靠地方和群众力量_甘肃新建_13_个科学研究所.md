The scope of research of the various institutes includes: crop production after sandy land irrigation and water diversion to the mountains, soil and water conservation and mountain cultivation techniques, sand fixation, afforestation and soil improvement for crops, prevention and control of animal epidemics, breeding of improved varieties and cultivation of grassland, agricultural mechanization and improvement and manufacture of agricultural tools and mountain transportation equipment, utilization of solar and wind energy, processing and utilization of animal and plant fibers, especially wild plant Apocynum venetum, and prevention and control of endemic diseases in mountainous areas.

The funds and equipment needed for these scientific research institutions are to be resolved by the relevant units through their own adjustments, making full use of existing equipment. Researchers can also be selected from existing technical cadres, teachers, technicians, and farmers with certain production experience and skills in various places to engage in scientific research work full-time or part-time.
