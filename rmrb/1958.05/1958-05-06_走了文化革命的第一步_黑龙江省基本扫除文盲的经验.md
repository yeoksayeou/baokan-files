Took the First Step in the Cultural Revolution
——The Experience of Heilongjiang Province in Basically Eliminating Illiteracy
By our correspondent Han Yunfei

Heilongjiang Province, long considered the province with the most illiteracy in China, has basically completed the task of eliminating illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. Over 86% of young and middle-aged workers and 81% of young and middle-aged farmers throughout the province know more than 1,500 characters and have generally achieved "four skills," namely, reading, writing, speaking, and application. They can all understand popular newspapers and periodicals, and they can also keep accounts, write letters, and write short articles. Many people have also learned to write work reports. At present, in order to consolidate and improve, they are carrying out activities to read a hundred books and write ten thousand characters. Amateur elementary and middle school classes are being widely opened. This is being carried out closely in conjunction with the current upsurge of socialist construction.

Heilongjiang Province's literacy campaign began in 1948. Before liberation, more than 85% of the people in the province were illiterate. In many villages, even one person who could serve as a clerk could not be found within a few dozen miles. As early as the years of the Liberation War, when the land reform movement had just been completed, the Party proposed launching a literacy movement. Winter schools were established in various places, and many male and female farmers who had never studied in their ancestors' generations went to school for the first time. Although the leadership lacked experience in running people-run schools at that time, and the phenomenon of "winter school, spring break, summer collapse, and no return in autumn" appeared in some places, the general trend was the prelude to a large-scale mass literacy movement. The Party, in leading the province's literacy movement, has been closely linked to agricultural production and various movements in different historical stages, and there have been three upsurges in eliminating illiteracy. The first upsurge was during the promotion of the rapid literacy method in 1952. At that time, people-run schools were generally established throughout the province, and the number of people participating in learning reached 1.2 million. The second upsurge was after agricultural cooperativization in 1956, when the broad masses linked their demand for learning culture with the construction of socialism. During this period, the Party, based on the characteristics of agricultural cooperativization, which made it easier for the masses to learn in terms of manpower, material resources, and learning time, strengthened the leadership of the literacy work and accelerated the speed of literacy. The number of people participating in learning during this period reached 2.01 million. The third upsurge was in the great leap forward in production last winter and this spring, which set off an upsurge in learning culture. Especially after summarizing and promoting the experience of Ning'an County, the first county in China to complete the task of eliminating illiteracy, in February this year, a massive nationwide literacy movement was launched in cities and villages throughout the province. 2.04 million people participated in this learning movement.

From the various stages of Heilongjiang Province's literacy campaign, it can be seen that there is a red line connecting them, which is the working method of implementing the Party's mass line. Eliminating illiteracy is an important part of the cultural revolution, and it must be realized through a mass movement. In the process of eliminating illiteracy, Heilongjiang Province did not adopt the method of only hiring a few full-time teachers, but adopted the mass movement of "people teaching people." Those who knew how to read taught those who did not know how to read. Junior high school graduates, senior elementary school graduates, "little teachers" studying in schools, and the large number of cadres who were sent down this time formed a mass literacy teacher team. It received great results. In the literacy campaign in Tailai County, all literate people were mobilized to offer advice and suggestions to speed up the literacy campaign, forming a situation where one person teaches one illiterate, advancing hand in hand. The county mobilized 20,000 literate people to participate in the literacy movement. In the later stage of the province's literacy campaign, a literacy army of 3 million people was reached. They were responsible for teaching 2.3 million illiterate people, from one person teaching several illiterate people to one person teaching one illiterate person, and some even several people teaching one illiterate person, which greatly improved the efficiency of eliminating illiteracy. In terms of literacy learning organization and methods, according to the characteristics of different seasons and different objects, forms such as centralized classes, kang-head groups, production learning groups, and guaranteed teaching and learning groups were promoted in the learning organization. A situation was formed where someone teaches in the classroom, someone teaches in the field, someone teaches at home, someone teaches when going out, someone teaches at meetings, someone teaches while working, and someone teaches while eating. At the same time, a high tide of everyone catching up with and learning from advanced people was set off in the literacy campaigns in various places. Many places adopted the practice of awarding the honorary plaque of "Cultural Home" to households that had eliminated illiteracy, and issuing the "Literate Person" plaque to those who had finished learning 1,500 characters and were no longer illiterate, creating an atmosphere of literacy being glorious and being free of illiteracy being an honor. In this way, in the final upsurge of the province's literacy work, one million illiterate people were eliminated in just half a year, thus completing the task of eliminating illiteracy in the province.

The most difficult problem encountered in eliminating illiteracy in various places is the contradiction between learning, production, and work. Various places have adopted the method of taking production as the center and combining literacy and production, as proposed by the Party. The specific measures are the method of comprehensive arrangement of unified deployment, unified inspection, and unified reporting of various tasks. In this way, the contradictory situation between learning, production, and work has been reversed. For example, after the Ning'an County Party Committee went deep into the grassroots, it found that although there were some contradictions between learning and production, there was also an internal connection of mutual promotion. For example, at that time, the experience of Zaoyuan's high yield was promoted in the countryside, and the county party committee required 96% of the people to learn this experience. Farmers learned the Zaoyuan close planting method by going to the fields during the day in conjunction with production, and opened small training classes in the evening. It seemed that learning culture would be squeezed out. But precisely, to learn the Zaoyuan high-yield experience well, one had to understand some technical knowledge and have culture. Based on this situation, the Ning'an County Party Committee decided to popularize the Zaoyuan high-yield experience and use it as a textbook for learning culture, so that farmers could read it, learning both the Zaoyuan experience and culture, achieving two things at once. As for how to solve the contradiction between production and learning during the busy farming season, Ning'an County also found experience in going deep among the masses. The county party committee found that farmers rested for two hours at noon when hoeing the ground, and took a half-hour break in the morning and afternoon. They combined the production team and the learning team into one, equipped each team with a literacy tutor, and used the rest and lunch break time to study in the field, thus solving the problem of not delaying both production and learning during the busy season.

Heilongjiang Province's literacy work has always adopted the working method of promoting from points to areas. The departments in the province that lead the literacy work have focused on Ning'an County for several years, gaining experience and promoting it in a timely manner. And Ning'an County took the United Agricultural Cooperative of Fanjiagang Township and Yulin Township as typical examples, using the method of breaking through one point and promoting it comprehensively. On October 1, 1956, the United Cooperative of Fanjiagang Township took the lead in eliminating illiteracy. The county party committee immediately organized more than 60 agricultural cooperative directors, party branch secretaries, and more than 40 literacy cadres to visit, thus setting off a high tide of townships and cooperatives throughout the county catching up with the advanced. Then Yulin Township also won in 1957. The good news of the elimination of illiteracy in the above-mentioned one cooperative and one township shocked all townships and cooperatives in the county like a thunderclap in spring. Finally, on February 1 this year, the entire county achieved blossoming everywhere. The fact that Ning'an County eliminated illiteracy made people clearly realize that the province's literacy work had approached maturity. During this period, the province's literacy leading departments vigorously promoted Ning'an County's literacy experience, and various places put forward the slogan of "riding satellites, taking rockets, and catching up with Ning'an County," thus setting off a high tide of a great leap forward in literacy throughout the province. After three months of hard work and practical work, more than 80% of the province's 2.3 million young and middle-aged illiterate people have been eliminated, basically completing the literacy task.

    走了文化革命的第一步
    ——黑龙江省基本扫除文盲的经验
    本报记者　韩云非
    我国一向被认为文盲最多的黑龙江省，已基本完成了青壮年扫除文盲的任务，全省86％以上的青壮年工人和81％以上的青壮年农民都认识了一千五百字以上，普遍作到了“四会”，即会读、会写、会讲、会用，他们都能看懂通俗的报刊，还能够记账、写信、写短文，有不少人还学会了写工作报告。目前他们为了巩固提高，正在开展读百本书，写一万个字的活动。普遍开办业余高小班和中学班。紧密地和当前的社会主义建设高潮结合进行。
    黑龙江省的扫盲工作是1948年开始的。在解放以前，全省人民中，85％以上是文盲，许多村屯，在几十里之内就连一个能够当文书的人都找不到。还是在解放战争年代，当时土地改革运动刚刚完成，党就提出了开展识字运动，各地冬学相继成立，许许多多祖祖辈辈没有读过书的男女农民，第一次上了学。当时领导上虽然缺乏举办民校的各项经验，有些地方也曾出现过“冬学、春散、夏垮台、到了秋天就不来”的现象，但从总的趋势看，那就是以后大规模开展群众性扫盲运动的序幕。党在领导全省扫盲运动上由于紧紧地与各个不同历史阶段农业生产和各项运动相联系，曾出现三次扫除文盲的高潮。第一次高潮是在1952年推广速成识字法时，那时，全省各地普遍建立了民校，参加学习的人数达到一百二十万人。第二次高潮是1956年农业合作化后，广大群众把学习文化的要求和建设社会主义联系起来。党在这个时期，根据农业合作化以后，不论从人力、物力、学习时间上都便于群众学习的特点，加强了扫盲工作的领导，加快了扫盲速度，这时期参加学习人数达到了二百零一万人。第三次高潮是在去冬今春的生产大跃进中，掀起了学习文化高潮，特别是在今年2月总结和推广了我国第一个完成扫除文盲任务的宁安县的经验，全省城市和农村掀起了一个声势浩大的全民性的扫盲运动，参加这个学习运动的达二百零四万人。
    从黑龙江省扫盲的各个阶段的过程中，可以看出有一条红线联系着，就是贯彻了党的群众路线的工作方法。扫除文盲是文化革命的重要部分，它必须通过群众性运动才能实现。黑龙江省在扫盲过程中，不是采取只限于聘请几个专职教师的办法，而是采取“以民教民”的群众性运动。认识字的教不识字的，初中毕业生、高小毕业生、在学校念书的“小先生”，以及这次下放的大批干部，组成了群众性扫盲教师队伍。收到极大效果。泰来县在扫盲中，曾调动一切识字人，为加快扫盲献计献策，形成了一人教一盲，手拉手前进的局面。全县发动了二万名识字的人投入扫盲运动。在全省扫盲后一阶段中，曾达到三百万人的扫盲大军。包教二百三十万文盲，由过去一人教数盲到一人教一盲，有的甚至数人教一盲，大大提高了扫除文盲的效率。在扫盲的学习组织和方法上，根据季节不同，对象不同的特点，在学习组织上推广了集中班、炕头组、生产学习组、包教保学组等形式。形成了课堂有人教，下地有人教，在家有人教，出外有人教，开会有人教，干活有人教，吃饭有人教的局面。同时，各地在扫盲中，都掀起了人人赶先进、学先进的高潮，许多地方采取哪一户扫除了文盲，就可以得到“文化之家”的光荣牌，那个人识完一千五百字，不再是文盲了，就发给“识字人”牌，造成了识字光荣，无盲荣誉的气氛。这样，使全省扫盲工作，在最后这次高潮中，仅半年的时间就扫除了一百万文盲。从而完成了全省扫除文盲的任务。
    各地在扫除文盲中，遇到最难解决的问题，是学习、生产和工作之间的矛盾。各地对这个问题是按着党提出的以生产为中心，做到扫盲和生产结合的办法。具体措施是各项工作统一布置，统一检查，统一汇报的全面安排的方法。这样就使学习、生产和工作之间互相矛盾的局面得到了扭转。例如宁安县经过县委深入基层，发现学习和生产虽然存在一些矛盾，但也存在互相推动的内在联系。如当时在农村推广肇源丰产经验，县委要求96％的人要学会这个经验。农民便白天结合生产到地里学习肇源密植的耕作方法，晚间开小型训练班，看起来好像学习文化会被挤掉。而恰恰要学习好肇源丰产经验就得懂些技术知识，就要有文化，宁安县委根据这个情况，就确定了把肇源丰产经验加以通俗化，当成了学文化的课本，让农民去读，既学习了肇源经验，又学习了文化，一举两得。至于在农忙期间如何解决生产和学习矛盾的问题，宁安县也在深入群众中找到了经验，县委发现农民在铲地时午间休息二小时，上下午各歇气半小时，他们就把生产小组和学习小组合一，每组配备识字辅导员，利用歇气、午间休息时间在地头学习，从而解决了在大忙中生产学习两不误的问题。
    黑龙江省的扫盲工作一向是采取以点推面的工作方法，省领导扫盲工作的部门，几年来就以宁安县为主，取得经验，及时推广。而宁安县又是以范家乡联合农业社和榆林乡为典型，运用突破一点，推广全面的办法。在1956年10月1日，范家乡联合社一马当先扫除了文盲，县委立即组织了六十多名农业社主任、党支书和四十多名扫盲干部去参观，从而全县掀起了乡乡社社赶先进的热潮，紧接着榆林乡也在1957年告捷。上述这一个社和一个乡扫除文盲的捷报，像一声春雷一样震动了全县各乡社，终于在今年2月1日全县达到遍地开花。宁安县扫除文盲的事实，使人们清楚的认识到全省扫盲工作已接近成熟时期，省扫盲领导部门在这个时期就大力推广了宁安县的扫盲经验，各地纷纷提出，“乘卫星，坐火箭，赶上宁安县”的口号，于是在全省范围内掀起了扫盲大跃进的高潮。经过三个月的苦干、实干，全省的二百三十万青壮年文盲中，已扫除了80％以上，基本上完成了扫盲任务。
