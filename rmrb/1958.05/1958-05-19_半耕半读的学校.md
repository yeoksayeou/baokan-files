Part-Work, Part-Study Schools

The first group of students has graduated from the part-work, part-study school established in Longchuan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture.

This first group of twenty-four students, from nationalities including the Jingpo and Lisu, learned the Jingpo language (Jingpo script), Daiwa script, arithmetic, and abacus calculations, and mastered some advanced farming techniques over nine months of study. They also grew 4,800 catties of rice, over 2,000 catties of peanuts, and a large quantity of vegetables.

This school is specifically for training agricultural cooperative cadres and accountants from the Jingpo people, who are directly transitioning to socialism.

The school is right next to the fields. The students study for half a day and produce for half a day, immediately applying the agricultural knowledge and advanced production techniques they have learned to their own reclaimed paddy fields and peanut fields.

    半耕半读的学校
    德宏傣族景颇族自治州陇川县开办的半耕半读学校，第一批学生已经毕业。
    这第一批有景颇族、傈僳族等民族学生二十四人，经过九个月的学习，他们分别学会了景颇族的景颇文、戴瓦文、算术和珠算，并掌握一些先进的耕作技术。他们还种出四千八百斤稻谷、二千多斤花生和大批蔬菜。
    这个学校是专门为直接过渡到社会主义的景颇族培养农业社干部和会计的。
    学校就在田边，学员半天读书，半天生产，把学到的农业知识和先进生产技术，紧接着运用到自己开垦的水田和花生地上。
