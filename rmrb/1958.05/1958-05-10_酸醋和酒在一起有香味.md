Why?

    Sour Vinegar and Wine Together Have a Fragrance
    When we make dishes containing sour flavors, we often add a small amount of yellow wine or sorghum wine in order to make it emit an enticing aroma. It turns out that sour vinegar and wine contain acetic acid and ethanol. When the two are mixed together and stirred, a chemical change occurs, producing a new substance called ester, which has a pleasant fragrance. (Yao)

专栏：为什么？

    酸醋和酒在一起有香味
    当我们做含有酸味的菜肴时，往往要放上少量的黄酒或高粱酒，为的是使它发出诱人的香味来。原来在酸醋与酒中含有乙酸及乙醇，两者混在一起，经过搅拌后，发生化学变化，生成了一种新物质，称为酯，具有好闻的香味。　（耀）
