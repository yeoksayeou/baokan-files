　　　Tan Sitong and the Hundred Days' Reform
　　　Zhi Fei
　　In Lao She's play "Teahouse," the first act is set against the backdrop of the Hundred Days' Reform of 1898. In the dialogue, Eunuch Pang mentions: "The world is at peace now; the imperial decree has been issued, Tan Sitong is to be beheaded!..."
　　The Hundred Days' Reform, a reform movement, is now exactly sixty years past. Although its duration was only a hundred days, it directly fostered the subsequent Xinhai Revolution.
　　Tan Sitong (1865-1898), courtesy name Fusheng, was a native of Liuyang County, Hunan Province. In his youth, he served in the army in Xinjiang and traveled extensively throughout the northern and southern provinces, "observing local customs and seeking out heroes." At this time, China had already been reduced to a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894 and the subsequent Treaty of Shimonoseki with Japan the following year, the people of the whole country were filled with grief and indignation. He wrote a poem entitled "Feelings," containing the lines "Four hundred million people shed tears together; where in the world is China," profoundly expressing his love for the motherland.
　　After the Sino-Japanese War, foreign invaders openly advocated "partitioning the Qing Empire," which stimulated intellectuals with democratic ideas to unite and resist foreign aggression, leading to the emergence of the reformist movement to preserve the nation and its people. This movement was led by Kang Youwei, Liang Qichao, Tan Sitong, and others. Kang Youwei advocated joint governance by the emperor and the people, while Tan Sitong advocated complete popular rule. Kang Youwei advocated compromise with the old faction, while Tan Sitong advocated struggle. Therefore, after the failure, Kang and Liang fled abroad, while he generously sacrificed himself.
　　In 1895, Kang Youwei united with over ten thousand examination candidates in Beijing to submit a ten-thousand-word memorial and organized the "Study Society for National Strength." They discussed government affairs, and study societies were successively established in various provinces. Tan Sitong established the "South Society" in Hunan and served as the editor-in-chief of the "Xiang Bao" newspaper, actively promoting methods to save the country out of patriotism.
　　In the summer of 1898, Emperor Guangxu issued an edict for reform and innovation. Tan Sitong, recommended by Xu Zhijing, entered Beijing to participate in the new policies and was appointed as a fourth-rank official in the Grand Council. However, the stubborn faction led by Empress Dowager Cixi secretly arranged a restoration and carried out a coup. Guangxu wanted to rely on Yuan Shikai's military strength to protect himself, and Tan Sitong personally went to discuss a secret plan with Yuan Shikai. He did not recognize the true face of the great thief Yuan Shikai. Due to Yuan Shikai's betrayal and informing, Cixi immediately imprisoned Guangxu and arrested the reformers, and the reformist situation after the reform was declared over.
　　After the failure of the reform, Kang Youwei fled to Hong Kong, and Liang Qichao fled to Tokyo. Some people also advised Tan Sitong to flee, but he resolutely refused, saying: "No reform in any country has ever been achieved without bloodshed. Now, in China, there has never been a case of bloodshed for reform. This is why the country is not prosperous. If there must be, let it begin with Sitong." He was executed together with Yang Shenxiu, Yang Rui, Lin Xu, Liu Guangdi, Kang Guangren, and others, known to the world as the "Six Gentlemen of the Hundred Days' Reform."
　　He authored "Ren Xue" (A Study of Benevolence) and a collection of poems and essays. In "Ren Xue," he expressed materialist ideas, filled with a spirit of struggle and a program of social reform, expressing a deep hatred for the reactionary rule of the Qing Dynasty. On the eve of the Xinhai Revolution, Zou Rong, the author of "Revolutionary Army," greatly admired Tan Sitong, hanging his portrait beside his seat and writing a poem: "The illustrious Lord Tan is gone, the aspirations of Hunan have waned. I only hope that those who come later will rise up and not let their ambitions fade." He is indeed a "respectable enlightenment thinker" (in the words of Comrade Chen Boda).

    谭嗣同与戊戌变法
　　　知非
    老舍同志所写的话剧“茶馆”，第一幕以1898年的戊戌变法为时代背景，对话中庞太监提到：“天下太平了；圣旨下来，谭嗣同问斩！……”
    戊戌变法的维新运动，距今正好六十年，它的过程虽然仅仅一百天，但它直接孕育了后来的辛亥革命。
    谭嗣同（1865—1898）字复生，湖南浏阳县人，他青年时代曾从军新疆，又遍游南北各省，“察视风土，物色豪杰”。这时中国早已沦为半封建半殖民地国家，1894年中日甲午战争起，次年与日本签订马关条约，全国人民莫不悲愤，他写了一首诗，题为“有感”，中有“四万万人齐下泪，天涯何处是神州”，深刻地表现出他热爱祖国的情绪。
    甲午战争后，外国侵略者公开主张要“瓜分大清帝国”，刺激了有民主主义思想的知识分子，要求联合起来抵御外侮，在政治上产生了改良主义的保国保种运动。这一运动的倡导者，以康有为、梁启超、谭嗣同等为首，康有为主张君民共治，谭嗣同主张完全民治；康有为主张与旧派妥协，谭嗣同主张斗争，所以后来失败后，康、梁逃到国外，他则慷慨牺牲。
    1895年康有为在北京联合各省举人上万言书，组织“强学会”。议论朝政，各省也先后成立学会。谭嗣同在湖南成立了“南学会”，并主编“湘报”，积极宣传爱国救时的方法。
    1898年夏天，光绪皇帝颁布了变法维新的诏书，谭嗣同因徐致靖的荐举，入京参预新政，被任命为四品卿衔军机章京。但是以慈禧为首的顽固派，暗中布置复辟、进行政变。光绪想依赖袁世凯的兵力保护自己，谭嗣同亲自去与袁世凯策划密谈，他没有认识到大盗袁世凯的本来面目。由于袁世凯的叛卖告密，慈禧立即囚禁光绪，逮捕新党，变法后的维新局面，便宣告结束。
    维新失败后，康有为逃往香港；梁启超逃往东京。有人也劝谭嗣同逃亡，他毅然拒绝说：“各国变法无不从流血而成，今中国未闻有因变法而流血者，此国之所以不昌也，有之，请自嗣同始。”他与杨深秀、杨锐、林旭、刘光第、康广仁等同时被杀，世人称为“戊戌六君子”。
    他著有“仁学”及诗文集。在“仁学”中他表现了唯物论思想，充满了斗争精神与社会改革纲领，表达了对清朝反动统治的深刻仇恨。辛亥革命前夕“革命军”作者邹容，对谭嗣同极为崇拜，把他的遗像悬于座侧，并题诗云：“赫赫谭君故，湖湘志气衰，惟冀后来者，继起志勿灰。”他不愧是“可敬的启蒙思想家”（陈伯达同志语）。
