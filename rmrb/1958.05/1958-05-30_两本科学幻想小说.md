    Two Science Fiction Novels
    Guan Yu
    One of the tasks of children's science fiction is to make children accustomed to thinking boldly and studying diligently from an early age.
    In our country, the rise of science fiction creation and the attention it receives from readers are still recent developments. "The Missing Brother" and "The Elephant with Its Nose Cut Off," recently published by the China Children's Publishing House, offer scientific fantasies based on improving people's material and cultural life, increasing industrial and agricultural production, and are full of inspiration and practical significance.
    The content of "The Missing Brother" is as follows: Zhang Chunhua's brother has been missing for fifteen years. One day, he suddenly received a call from the Public Security Bureau, asking him to come because they had found a child named Zhang Jianhua, who was his brother who had been missing for fifteen years. It turned out that fifteen years ago, Zhang Jianhua broke into the quick-freezing workshop of an automated cold storage plant for frozen fish and froze in the workshop. Later, Dr. Wang of the Second Hospital performed a special operation and finally revived Zhang Jianhua, so the brother became fifteen years younger than his younger brother.
    In this work, the author provides a bold scientific hypothesis: After biological organisms are quickly frozen and refrigerated, life can be preserved without being damaged.
    The content of "The Elephant with Its Nose Cut Off" is as follows: A reporter went to "Emerald City," a newly emerging city in what used to be a desert area, for an interview. He saw a group of people rushing to see "elephants moving," so he followed along to take a look. To his surprise, these elephants had no noses. Why cut off the elephants' noses? The farm's animal husbandry expert invited him to visit the farm. It turned out that "the elephant with its nose cut off" was a new breed of pig called "Miracle No. 72." These pigs were raised using a special method of stimulating the pituitary gland with thorn...
    This work also provides a bold scientific hypothesis: to raise pigs as big as elephants using newly invented methods.
    When I first saw "The Elephant with Its Nose Cut Off" published in the April 1956 issue of "Middle School Student" magazine, the "Editor's Note" affirmed that pigs would definitely become larger in the future, although not necessarily using the method mentioned in the article. I wondered at the time, "Is it appropriate for the editor to write like this?" Similarly, I felt that "The Missing Brother" was also a bit too miraculous, especially because the characters and events in that novel were described very realistically.
    When artificial satellites went into space, and science fiction stories that were originally published in supplements were moved to the front-page headlines, I realized that my conservative ideas should change. A poet once said: "To believe in the power of the people is to be able to imagine, and the power of the people is a hundred times beyond imagination." This is completely correct. A young veterinarian from the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Mingcheng Township, Panshi County, Jilin Province, injected milk into the thyroid glands of live pigs weighing over sixty pounds, using the milk to inhibit thyroid metabolism and make the pigs fatten quickly. The results of the fourth experiment showed that one pig gained an average of 2.48 pounds of weight per day. Although they haven't grown as big as elephants yet, it confirms that the scientific fantasy in "The Elephant with Its Nose Cut Off" has practical significance.
    Today, when mankind is preparing to explore other planets, the possibility of realizing science fiction is too great. I no longer find "The Missing Brother" too miraculous either. Because I recently saw in the newspaper that a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner used willow sticks as bones to connect to a dog's leg. After a few days, the willow sticks became the same as bones, indistinguishable. And this is the inheritance of our ancestors' inventions and creations by traditional Chinese medicine. Isn't this even more miraculous than "The Missing Brother"?
    As for "The Missing Brother" and "The Elephant with Its Nose Cut Off" from an artistic point of view, it can also be said that these are two good children's books: the stories are novel and interesting, able to attract people, and make readers eager to continue reading after reading the beginning. The writing and dialogue are lively and vivid. In particular, "The Missing Brother" is detailed and moving, and the author constantly pays attention to the protagonist's emotions and psychological activities—something that general science fiction novels easily neglect.
    Recommend more excellent science fiction novels to children! It is hoped that children will be accustomed to liberating their minds from an early age, develop a character that loves innovation and creation, and make more things that predecessors have never done in this great era.

    两本科学幻想小说
    关雨
    使儿童从小就习惯于大胆地想和刻苦地钻研——这是儿童科学幻想小说的任务之一。
    在我国，科学幻想小说创作的兴起和受到读者们的注意，还是近几年来的事情。中国少年儿童出版社最近出版的“失踪的哥哥”和“割掉鼻子的大象”所提供的科学幻想，是基于提高人类的物质文化生活、提高工农业生产，富于启发性和现实意义。
    “失踪的哥哥”的内容是：张春华的哥哥失踪十五年了。有一天，他突然接到公安局的电话，请他去，说找到一个名叫张建华的小孩，就是他那失踪十五年的哥哥。原来十五年前，张建华闯进了自动化冷藏厂冻活鱼的速冻车间，就冻僵在车间里。后来第二医院的王大夫施行了特殊手术后，终于把张建华治活了，于是哥哥就比弟弟小了十五岁。
    在这篇作品里，作者提供了一个大胆的科学设想：生物经过速冻冷藏后，生命可以不遭受到破坏。
    “割掉鼻子的大象”的内容是：一位记者到原来是沙漠地带的新兴城市“绿宝石”去采访，看见一群人奔去看“大象搬家”，他便也跟了去瞧。使他大吃一惊的是这些大象都没有鼻子。为什么要割掉大象的鼻子？农场畜牧专家请他到农场去参观。原来“割掉鼻子的大象”就是名字叫作“奇迹72号”的新种猪。这种猪是用刺?脑下垂体的特殊方法培育大的……
    这篇作品也提供了一个大胆的科学设想：用新发明的方法，把猪养得跟大象一样大。
    当我第一次看见1956年4月号的“中学生”杂志上发表“割掉鼻子的大象”，“编者按”里肯定地说，将来猪是一定要变大的，虽然不一定用文中所提的这个方法；我当时曾经想：“编者这样写是否妥当呢，”同样地，我觉得“失踪的哥哥”也怪神乎其神的，尤其因为那篇小说中的人物、事件都描写得很逼真。
    当人造卫星上了天，原来只是在副刊上登载的科学幻想故事已移到第一版的头条新闻时，我才感到自己的那些保守想法应该改变了。有一位诗人曾说过：“要相信人民的力量，才能幻想，而人民的力量又是超越幻想百倍的”。这是完全正确的，吉林省磐石县明城镇五星农业社的一位青年兽医，用牛奶注射入六十斤以上的生猪甲状腺内，利用牛奶抑制甲状腺新陈代谢作用，使生猪快肥。第四次试验的结果，有一口猪平均每天增长体重2.48斤。虽然它们还没长得跟大象一样大，但却证实了“割掉鼻子的大象”中的科学幻想是有现实意义的。
    在人类正在作到别的行星上去探险的准备的今天，科学幻想实现的可能性是太大了。我现在也不觉得“失踪的哥哥”太神乎其神了。因为前几天看见报载有中医把柳木棒当骨头接到狗腿里，过了些日子，柳木棒就变得和骨头一样，看不出区别。而这是中医继承我国祖先的发明创造。难道这不比“失踪的哥哥”更为神奇吗？
    至于从艺术角度来看“失踪的哥哥”和“割掉鼻子的大象”，也可以说，这是两本好儿童读物：故事新颖有趣，能吸引人，使读者看了前面，急于要接着读下去。文字、对话生动活泼。特别是“失踪的哥哥”，描写细致动人，作者时时注意到主人公的感情和心理活动——这是一般科学幻想小说所容易忽视的。
    多向孩子们推荐优秀的科学幻想小说吧！希望孩子们从小就习惯于解放思想，养成爱革新和爱创造的性格，在这伟大时代里作出更多前人未曾作过的事。
