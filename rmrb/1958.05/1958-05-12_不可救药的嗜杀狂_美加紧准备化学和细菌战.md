Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 9th (TASS dispatch): A subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee released an abstract of the minutes of a closed meeting held on March 26th. The speech made by the commander of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps, Creasy, at this meeting revealed that the United States has long been actively preparing for chemical, bacteriological, and radiological warfare. Creasy confirmed that the U.S. Department of Defense had already issued a secret order in October 1956 regarding extensive preparations for chemical warfare.

According to Creasy's statement, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps is researching various poisonous gases and bacteriological weapons. Creasy said that the Chemical Corps is "very concerned" with researching chemical weapons that can completely destroy the human nervous system and intellectual activity.

Creasy complained that the current plan for researching such new weapons is "too narrow," and he insisted on expanding the plan tenfold. Creasy said that the Chemical Corps would "very much like" to research some new "promising" proposals. Creasy shamelessly said, "For example, if we could create a weapon that temporarily blinds people, that would be an ideal" weapon.

From Creasy's speech, it can be seen that the plan to manufacture chemical weapons that can destroy people's nervous systems is only a part of the Chemical Corps' activities. Creasy's words imply that the Chemical Corps is conducting experiments on large-scale killing weapons, especially experiments on live humans with bacteriological weapons.

    不可救药的嗜杀狂
    美加紧准备化学和细菌战
    据新华社11日讯　据塔斯社华盛顿9日讯：美国国会众议院拨款委员会小组委员会9日发表了3月26日举行的秘密会议记录摘要。美国陆军化学兵团司令克里茨在这次会议上的讲话透露，美国长久以来就在积极准备化学、细菌和放射性物质战争。克里茨证实，美国国防部早在1956年10月就已经颁布了一项关于广泛准备化学战争的密令。
    根据克里茨的声明看来，美国陆军化学兵团正在研究各种毒气和细菌武器。克里茨说，化学兵团“非常关心”研究能够完全破坏人的神经系统和智力活动的化学武器。
    克里茨抱怨说，目前研究这种新式武器的计划是“太狭小了”，他坚持要把这个计划扩大十倍。克里茨说，化学兵团“很想”对一些新的“有希望”的方案加以研究。克里茨无耻地说，“比如，如果我们能够制造出某种足以使人眼睛暂时失明的武器，那末这就会是一种理想”的武器。
    从克里茨的讲话中可以看出，制造能破坏人们神经系统的化学武器的计划，只是化学兵团活动的一部分。克里茨的话暗示，化学兵团正在进行大规模杀人武器的实验，特别是对活人进行细菌武器的实验。
