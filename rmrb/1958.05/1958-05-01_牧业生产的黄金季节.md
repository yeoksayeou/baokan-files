The Golden Season for Animal Husbandry Production

    Massive Increase in Fine Wool Lamb Production
    Inner Mongolia

    According to estimates from the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's animal husbandry departments, farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups in the region can expect to deliver over 6.6 million young livestock this year.

    A notable characteristic of Inner Mongolia's animal husbandry production this year is the high survival rate of young livestock. Herdsmen in Ulanqab, Bayannur, and Qahar, among other areas, have already delivered over 3 million newborn young livestock, with a survival rate generally between 90% and 95%, a significant improvement over previous years. In Gongyagai Township, Jungar Banner, all 7,600 lambs born to 8,500 breeding ewes survived.

    This year, there are more fine-wool or semi-fine-wool lambs on the grasslands of the Autonomous Region. The region is expected to produce over 170,000 fine-wool and semi-fine-wool lambs, an increase of over 10,000 from last year. Employees of the Xilin Gol stud farm recently delivered 265 Xinjiang fine-wool lambs. Due to the improved technical skills of the staff, the twinning rate reached 35.2%, and one ewe even gave birth to four lambs in a single birth.

    Another characteristic of animal husbandry in the Autonomous Region this year is the strong confidence and high enthusiasm of leaders at all levels and the broad masses of laboring herdsmen in striving for a bumper harvest in animal husbandry. They are doing everything possible to overcome natural disasters to reduce livestock losses and increase the survival rate of young livestock. In the past winter and spring alone, New Barag Left Banner in Hulunbuir League built 380 new sheds and dug 36 water wells for livestock on the harsh grasslands.

    Eight Million Ewes Giving Birth Successively
    Xinjiang

    A scene of abundant harvest prevails on the grasslands north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, with 8.2 million ewes giving birth successively. Farmers and herdsmen of all ethnic groups are working day and night to diligently nurture the lambs. Lambing has already concluded in the warmer southern parts of the Autonomous Region, and sheep flocks in Ili, Altay, Tacheng, and Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in northern Xinjiang have also begun to give birth. The survival rate of newborn lambs is very high everywhere this year. In Altay County, the survival rate of lambs already born has reached 98%. The survival rates of lambs in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and Minfeng and Yiwu counties are also above 90%. Herdsmen of all ethnic groups are currently engaged in a major spring lambing and rearing competition, with the slogan: "Ensure birth, ensure survival, ensure growth," and strive for a young livestock survival rate of 95%.

    Each One Delivered, Each One Lives
    Gansu

    Animal husbandry in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County, Subei Mongol Autonomous County, and Sunan Yugur Autonomous County in Gansu Province fired the first shot in the Great Leap Forward, with a generally abundant harvest in sheep production this year. The lamb survival rates in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County and Subei Mongol Autonomous County are higher than in previous years. Sunan Yugur Autonomous County produced over 40,000 lambs, with a survival rate of nearly 90%, an increase of 21% compared to 1957. Prior to lambing, various places universally organized lambing teams, prepared lambing bags and supplementary milk feeders, and some herdsmen also bought new kerosene lamps for lambing at night, umbilical cord scissors, disinfectant iodine, and medicines for treating lambs. Some cooperatives specially reserved enough milk cows to store milk for lambs lacking milk. In this way, many areas achieved that each one delivered lives.

    The bumper lamb production in these three autonomous counties this year occurred under the circumstances of the great development of animal husbandry cooperativization. Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County basically achieved cooperativization in early April. Due to the development of animal husbandry cooperatives, cooperativization has brought fundamental changes to the face of animal husbandry. The attendance rate of herdsmen has greatly increased, and the preparation and lambing work are meticulous and careful, with an unprecedented increase in survival rate. The survival rate of general cooperatives is above 90%, and some reach 100%. The first team of the Gucheng Cooperative in Tianzhu Tibetan Autonomous County had only 240 ewes, and all 120 lambs born survived, with a proliferation rate of 50%.

    100% Lamb Survival Rate
    Qinghai

    Winter lambing in the pastoral areas of Qinghai Province has already ended, and spring lambing has also basically concluded. According to recent materials from various places, the lamb survival rate is generally around 90%, with some areas as high as 95%, and the lamb survival rate of many poor herdsmen has reached 100%. Although the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture suffered severe wind disasters this spring, the lamb survival rate generally reached over 80%. This is an unprecedentedly abundant harvest of lambs on the Qinghai Plateau.

    Now that the harsh winter has passed and the weather is gradually warming, herdsmen of all ethnic groups are still taking various measures to strengthen lamb rearing and protection in order to ensure this year's abundant lamb harvest. (Peng Xue) (Attached picture)

    牧业生产的黄金季节
    大量增产细毛羊羔
    内蒙古
    据内蒙古自治区畜牧部门估计，今年全区各民族农牧民大约可以接产六百六十多万头幼畜。
    今年内蒙古牧业生产中的一个显著特点，是幼畜成活率高。乌兰察布、巴彦淖尔和察哈尔等地牧民，已经接产下三百多万头新生幼畜，仔畜的成活率一般都在90％到95％以上，比往年有显著提高。准格尔旗公亚盖乡，有八千五百只适龄繁殖的母羊，产羔七千六百只已全部成活。
    今年自治区草原上增加了更多的细毛或半细毛羊羔。全区大约能接产十七万多只细毛和半细毛羊羔，比去年增加一万多只。锡林郭勒种畜场的职工，前些日子已经接产下二百六十五只新疆细毛羊羔，由于职工们技术水平的提高，羊羔中双羔率达到35.2％，还有一只母羊一胎竟生下了四只羊羔。
    今年自治区畜牧业的另一个特点，是各级领导与广大劳动牧民争取牧业大丰收的信心足，干劲大。他们千方百计的战胜自然灾害，以减少牲畜的损失和提高仔畜的成活率。仅呼伦贝尔盟新巴尔虎左旗去冬今春就在严寒的草原上为畜群增建了三百八十座棚圈和打出三十六眼水井。
    八百万只母羊陆续产羔
    新疆
    新疆维吾尔自治区天山南北各草原上一片丰收景象，八百二十万只母羊陆续产羔，各族农牧民正夜以继日地紧张接育羊羔。自治区南部的早暖地区接羔工作已经结束，北疆的伊犁、阿勒泰、塔城和博尔塔拉蒙古族自治州等地的羊群，也开始产羔。今年各地新生的羊羔成活率都很高，阿勒泰县已产的羊羔，成活率达98％。巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和民丰、伊吾等县，羔羊的成活率也都在90％以上。各族牧民目前正在进行春季接羔育羔大竞赛，他们的口号是：保生、保活、保壮，力争幼畜成活率达到95％。
    接一个  活一个
    甘肃
    甘肃天祝藏族自治县、肃北蒙古族自治县、肃南裕固族自治县畜牧业在大跃进中打响了第一炮，今年羊只生产普遍获得丰收。天祝藏族自治县和肃北蒙古族自治县的羔羊成活率都比往年高，肃南裕固族自治县产羔四万多只，成活率近90％，比1957年提高了21％。各地接羔前普遍组织了接羔小组，准备了接羔袋和补乳器，有些牧民还新买了夜晚接羔的马灯、剪脐带的剪子，消毒的碘酒和治羔羊用的药品。有些社特别留下足够奶牛给缺奶羔羊储备奶。这样，许多地区做到下一个接一个，接一个活一个。
    这三个自治县今年羔羊丰产是在畜牧业合作化大发展的情况下出现的，天祝藏族自治县4月上旬已基本上实现合作化。由于牧业社发展，合作化给牧业面貌带来了根本改变，牧民劳动出勤率大大提高，接羔准备和接羔工作精心细致，成活率空前提高，一般社成活率都在90％以上，有的达到100％。天祝藏族自治县古城社一队只有母羊二百四十只，产羔一百二十只都活了，增殖率达50％。
    羊羔百分之百成活
    青海
    青海省牧业区的冬季产羔早已结束，春季产羔也已基本结束。据各地最近材料来看，羔羊成活率普遍在90％左右，部分地区高达95％以上，不少贫苦牧民的羔羊成活率并达到了100％。海西蒙、藏、哈萨克族自治州虽然今春风灾严重，羔羊成活率也普遍达到了80％以上。这是青海高原上空前未有的羔羊大丰收。
    现在，严冬已过，天气日趋和暖，但是为了确保今年的羔羊大丰收，各族牧民仍采取各种措施加强育羔护羔工作。　（彭雪）（附图片）
