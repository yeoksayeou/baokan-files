    Rectification Campaign and Technical Revolution in Industrial Enterprises
    Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China
    In his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi proposed: "While continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, we should gradually realize the technological revolution and the cultural revolution." Now, this new revolutionary historical task has been placed before the entire Party and the people of the whole country.

    Judging from the situation in Hubei Province, industrial enterprises are also facing such a new historical period. At this time, a correct understanding of the internal connection between the rectification campaign and the technical revolution is of great significance for improving enterprise work.

    The Rectification Campaign Paved the Way for the Technical Revolution
    After the rectification campaign, industrial enterprises in the Hubei area have generally shown a new atmosphere. To sum up: a great change in cadre work style, a great improvement in mass awareness, and a great leap forward in production and construction.

    A great change in cadre work style: the working methods of "three togethers" (eat, live, and labor together) and "experimental fields" have become common practice. According to incomplete statistics from Wuhan and Huangshi, 80% of cadres in enterprises participate in labor. The implementation of "three togethers," "participating in production, leading production" by cadres has achieved good results in improving the relationship between leaders and production personnel. For example, the manager, deputy managers, and party secretary of a construction engineering company in Wuhan used to live in the same building. Because their work was not thorough and they did not approach the masses, the workers called them the "Four Big Families." After they implemented the "three togethers," the workers became as close to them as family members. When the manager of this company moved to the construction site to learn from apprentices, the workers ignored him for the first three days. Later, they saw the manager getting up early to sweep the floor, fetch water, discuss how to eliminate bedbugs with the clinic, discuss with the trade union about borrowing money for workers to buy mosquito nets, and promptly solve some construction management problems and cooperation issues between various construction sites. The workers were very moved. They said, "In the past, we didn't know who the manager was. Now the manager labors and sleeps with us. This has never happened before." Another example: Liu Ruixiang, the branch secretary of the Public Security County Postal and Telecommunications Bureau, used to not approach the masses and liked to "shave" workers (ignore people who came to him). The workers called him "Shaving Secretary." After implementing the "three togethers," he was responsible for delivering mail on a fifteen-kilometer postal route and participated in line construction. He wore a raincoat to deliver newspapers and letters on rainy days. Now the workers call him "Labor Secretary." There are countless examples of leading cadres taking the lead, combining with technical personnel and production workers to engage in "experimental workshops," "experimental work sections," and "one-stop trials."

    A great improvement in mass awareness: those who used to make trouble about wages are now proposing "no wage increase until we catch up with England"; those who used to lead some workers to petition the trade union against revising quotas are now mobilizing the masses and explaining the rationality of revising quotas; those who used to steal machine tools to do private work in underground factories are now using waste materials to make new special-purpose machine tools, increasing efficiency several times. The enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were particularly evident during the rectification campaign, especially during the "double anti" (anti-waste and anti-conservatism) stage. Inventions, creations, and rationalization proposals for improving technical equipment, improving operating methods, and improving labor organization are more numerous than at any time in the past, and many unknown "little people" have become outstanding innovators. For example, Gao Puxian, a worker at the Hanyang Machine Factory, only studied for eight months. He was "deaf and mute" from the age of twelve and started working at the age of thirteen, and was always looked down upon. After the rectification campaign, he also actively participated in technical innovation, using waste materials to make an automatic steel sawing machine, which reduced the labor intensity of workers and greatly improved steel sawing efficiency.

    A great leap forward in production and construction: This year's production upsurge is on a larger scale than the production upsurge in 1956.

    In our province, the industrial output value in 1956 increased by 31% compared with 1955. This was the year with the largest increase during the First Five-Year Plan. In 1957, affected by the anti-"rash advance" in the second half of 1956, it increased by only 18% compared with 1956. This year, the industrial output value is very likely to increase by more than 50% compared with 1957.

    This year, the development speed of local industry has greatly improved. The Nanning and Chengdu Conferences greatly promoted local industry. Many counties have established hundreds or more than a thousand small factories in just a few months this year. The output value of many original enterprises can increase by more than one or two times this year. Before the Nanning Conference, when we started considering the Second Five-Year Plan, the funds for local industry could only raise about 200 million yuan. Now, 500 million to 600 million yuan can be invested in 1958 alone. We preliminarily estimate that more than 4 billion yuan can be invested in local industry during the Second Five-Year Plan. Agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization can be basically realized in five to seven years. In five to seven years, the total output value of local industry in the province can catch up with or exceed the total output value of agriculture.

    The above situation shows that after the rectification campaign, the relations of production have been further improved, productive forces have been further liberated, and extremely favorable conditions have been created for the technical revolution. At the same time, after the rectification campaign, a situation of great leap forward in production has emerged, and a large-scale technical revolution movement must be carried out to adapt to the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results.

    Continue to Consolidate and Develop the Achievements of the Rectification Campaign in the Technical Revolution Movement

    The rectification campaign in enterprises has not yet ended, but the technical revolution movement has already begun; the constantly developing revolution has advanced from one stage to another. Under this situation, we must both carry out the rectification campaign to the end to achieve complete victory, and promptly launch the technical revolution movement to adapt to the new situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction. Therefore, we must creatively apply the experience of the rectification campaign to the technical revolution movement, and consolidate and carry forward the achievements of the rectification campaign in the technical revolution movement.

    The achievements of the rectification campaign are very rich. Here, I would like to focus on two important and interrelated achievements: (1) The glorious tradition of the Party's mass line has been developed; (2) Many superstitions have been broken and people's minds have been liberated.

    Whether or not the Party committee's leadership is needed in industrial enterprises, and whether or not the mass line is needed, has been the focus of debate for many years. Some people once had the idea and said that the central government's decision on leadership methods was only suitable for rural areas and agriculture, but not suitable for cities and industry; they ridiculed a series of mass line methods such as "from point to area, combining points and areas" and "visiting door to door, individual contacts" as "rural viewpoints" and "guerrilla habits." The First Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party officially affirmed that the factory director responsibility system under the leadership of the Party committee must be implemented in industrial enterprises, and the principle of combining collective leadership of the Party and individual responsibility, and combining leadership backbone and the broad masses must be implemented. Subsequently, the Party Central Committee determined that the mass supervision system under the leadership of the Party committee, namely the workers' representative congress system, should be implemented in industrial enterprises. In recent years, the Party's leadership in industrial enterprises has been strengthened, and the methods of the mass line have been more "popular." After this great rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, by adopting forms such as great contending, great blooming, great rectification, great change, great debate, and big-character posters, the Party's leadership has been further strengthened and consolidated, and the working methods of the mass line have been developed. Thus, a new situation has emerged in enterprises.

    The Party's leadership and the mass line still play a decisive role in the technical revolution movement. The views that "laymen cannot lead experts" and "the masses have low scientific, technological, and cultural levels, therefore, scientific and technological work cannot follow the mass line" originally existed, and such erroneous views may resurface during the technical revolution period. Practical experience proves that not only can laymen lead experts, but also laymen leading experts is a general and normal law. Scientific work and technical work, like other work, must come from the masses and go to the masses. Scientists and technicians can only play their due role by combining with the workers and peasants under the leadership of the Party.

    Here, I would like to give an example: The quality of high-quality steel from the Daye Steel Plant was very poor before 1955, with many returns. Many brother factories and mines were unwilling to use the steel from the Daye Steel Plant. The sales personnel of the plant did not dare to give their names at order meetings. The workers in the electric furnace workshop said, "Our reputation stinks forty miles against the wind." The technicians said there was no way and relied entirely on Soviet experts. Soviet experts came several times and made many suggestions. They also smelted several batches of better steel when they were present, but there was no way to do it after the experts left. In the autumn of 1955, the Party committee and administrative leaders of the Daye Steel Plant decided to look downward, conduct investigations and research, rely on the masses, find out the key, propose measures, and convene a production technology representative meeting (i.e., the workers' representative congress) to discuss and supplement the plan proposed by the factory director, unified their thinking, and then implemented it consistently from top to bottom, and the quality of high-quality steel greatly improved. In the autumn of 1956, they organized cadres to seriously study "Reform Our Study," "The Central Committee's Decision on Leadership Methods," and the "Eighth National Congress" documents, and combined them with actual work to conduct a "small rectification," and then on the basis of this rectification, mobilized the masses to summarize advanced technical operation experience and revise technical regulations, not only striving to combine the content of the technical regulations with the actual situation and mass experience, but also striving to make the writing style popular and adapt it to the workers' cultural level and customary language; for example, writing "tilting" the furnace by a certain degree as "skewing" the furnace by a certain degree, and writing the "breakability" test as the "bending" test, etc. After revising the technical regulations, they then opened training classes, signed apprenticeship contracts, mutual teaching and learning contracts, and launched a mass movement to learn and implement the regulations. A realistic and mass line method was also adopted for implementing the suggestions of Soviet experts. For example, the main problems of high-quality steel at that time were "subcutaneous bubbles" and "honeycomb bubbles." Soviet experts had found that the main reason for the "bubbles" was that the steel contained too much hydrogen, and they put forward some methods for removing hydrogen. However, what was the specific activity of hydrogen in the smelting and casting process? It remains to be further proven. Therefore, they changed their past attitude of "not using their brains and eating ready-made meals," and first conducted key experiments in the No. 2 electric furnace. Leading cadres, technicians, and production workers closely combined, organized experimental groups, and adopted the method of "unified leadership, division of labor and cooperation, key analysis, and comprehensive summary" to conduct thorough research on each process, each worker's operation method, and the equipment conditions of each part. After more than forty furnaces of experiments, scientific data was found, and the law of hydrogen activity in the smelting and casting process was found. After such experimental research, the experts' suggestions were supplemented, and the experts' suggestions were truly implemented, solving the key problems of production. It can be seen from this that any excellent technician can only play a positive role by combining with practice and combining with the masses under the leadership of the Party. Now the high-quality steel of the Daye Steel Plant is truly "high-quality" steel. The workers said, "The quality has turned over, and the order form comes to the door." The quality qualification rate in 1957 was 99.54% nationwide, exceeding the national target, and the quality qualification rate of many shifts and groups in the electric furnace workshop was 100%. The main experience of the "quality turnaround" of high-quality steel in this plant is to follow the mass line in production technology work.

    Conservative ideology and outdated habits are the main obstacles to the technical revolution. The technical regulations and other relevant rules and regulations in our factories and mines have been moved from foreign countries, inherited from old China, and summarized from the practical experience of the masses. Needless to say, the first two types cannot conform to the actual situation without revision and supplementation; even the third type, if not properly revised in a certain period, will lag behind the requirements of technological innovation and production development. Some factories and mines have put forward the slogans of "breaking superstitions, breaking conservatism, boldly creating, and boldly experimenting." We believe that these slogans are correct and in line with the spirit of Chairman Mao's teachings of "boldly mobilizing the masses and experimenting with everything."

    In the rectification campaign, many superstitions have been broken, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has been greatly improved. However, the technical mystification theory and the mental state of superstition in old conventions and bad habits still exist among some people. In the technical revolution movement, we must also follow Chairman Mao's repeated instructions, thoroughly break superstitions, and inspire the fearless creative spirit of workers, staff, and new and old cadres.

    Oppose Empiricism and Dogmatism in Carrying out the Technical Revolution

    In the struggle of the technical revolution, we must oppose empiricism. One of the manifestations of empiricism is the lack of comprehensive and systematic analysis of the situation of the enterprise. The various problems in production technology are viewed in isolation, and the method of treating the head when it hurts and treating the feet when they hurt is used to deal with them. As a result, one is lost to the other, and even the more one tries to sort things out, the more chaotic they become. Sometimes, a "key" problem is "solved" on the surface, but in a few days, the "key" rebounds. Another manifestation of empiricism is "disregarding science and technology, not learning science and technology, not valuing technical personnel, not paying attention to cultivating and expanding the scientific and technological team, and adopting a cold attitude towards new technologies and new experiences, thinking that one can do everything well with one's own set of old experiences." Without correcting the mistakes of empiricism, there is no way to talk about the technical revolution at all.

    In the struggle of the technical revolution, we must also oppose dogmatism. The influence of dogmatism in enterprises, especially in large enterprises, is quite serious. A factory in Wuhan mechanically copied the large book of process regulations without starting from the actual situation of the factory. The workers said, "It hurts to think of the process regulations," "It is as thick as a novel, but not as attractive as a novel." The length of the process documents and the complexity of the process routes hinder the development of productive forces. If a simple tool is temporarily needed in the workshop, it must go through eight units: the workshop itself, the tool section, the process section, the supply section, the material warehouse, the production section, the material preparation workshop, and the central tool warehouse, and go through eleven procedures. Once, the workshop urgently needed a few simple auxiliary tools, and it took 120 days to travel between the above eight departments. The machine tool was idle and the workers were waiting. The workers said: "An urgent wind meets a slow doctor," "There is energy, but it is useless." The people who compiled the process lacked operating experience and were not familiar with the equipment, so they had to copy books. The processing technology of the long screw of a vertical lathe was written on thirty-three pages of octavo paper. In fact, only the first three pages of the process card were enough, but many unnecessary nonsense had to be written, which made people headache. Therefore, the workers said: "This is a process for catching a cold." During the rectification campaign, workers posted many big-character posters on the issue of rules and regulations. The Party committee and administrative leaders of the factory have recently conducted key experiments in some workshops, proving that the rules and regulations can be greatly revised and the process can be appropriately simplified. For example, in the small and medium-sized parts workshop, technical workers were absorbed to compile the process. The original process of six workpieces had a total of 207 pages, which were revised by the workers to 15 pages; in addition, three workpieces, according to the originally compiled process, had to go through 54 procedures. After being compiled and revised by the workers, only 33 procedures were needed. After the workshop adopted this method of "mass compilation of processes," the workload of compiling processes was reduced by 80%, the paper saved by 81%, the time saved for workers to read process documents by 75%, and the time saved for processing preparation and termination by 42%. Therefore, the production cycle was greatly shortened and the output was greatly increased.

    In the rectification campaign, especially in the "double anti" stage, there was almost no enterprise that did not expose some unreasonable rules and regulations. At the same time, as long as the masses were mobilized and some reasonable revisions were made to the rules and regulations, the development of productive forces could be effectively promoted. For example, the Central South Industrial Design Institute had quite serious problems with dogmatism before the rectification. In their own words, it was "three moves" - one move was foreign design; the second move was moving from large factories to small factories; and the third move was moving technical specification clauses. When they designed the Hengyang Drilling Machine Factory, which was not very large, they also divided it into the front-of-factory area, the workshop area, the warehouse area, the welfare area, the main road, the secondary road, the central axis, etc., just like designing a large factory. According to the saying that "the more workshops are merged, the more economical it is," they designed the factory's tool, machine repair, electrical repair, heat treatment, assembly and other workshops and the trial manufacturing section into a large combined workshop. However, the site of the Hengyang Drilling Machine Factory was a hilly area. According to this design, the mountain had to be leveled, which increased a lot of earthwork projects, and after the workshops were merged, the fire protection level and construction cost had to be increased. During the rectification campaign, they seized this typical example, examined their design ideas, criticized dogmatism, and revised the rules and regulations. After that, the factories they designed greatly saved investment. For example, the civil construction investment of the Laohekou Baked Rubber Factory originally planned could build the same two and a half factories; the civil construction investment of the Zhuzhou Chemical Fertilizer Plant originally planned could build the same five factories.

    We emphasize the Party's mass line, but we never underestimate the role of technology and technicians. On the contrary, we emphasize the Party's mass line precisely to more effectively exert the power of technology, more fully exert the active role of technicians, and train more, faster, better, and more economically both red and expert technical talents. We believe that the close combination of the three "elements" of leading cadres, technicians, and production workers is necessary to form a strong technical team.

    We emphasize breaking superstitions and liberating the mind, but we never disbelieve in science. On the contrary, superstition and science are incompatible. People who truly believe in science do not believe in gods, do not believe in ghosts, and are not afraid of heaven or earth. They dare to use the laws of nature to overcome nature, and dare to sweep away all obstacles to transform the world. They do not hold a mysterious view of science, and believe that science is a summary of practical experience and a crystallization of human labor. Only science that can stand the test of practice is true science. They dare to absorb new experiences of practice to supplement and develop scientific theories, and dare to abandon everything that is not practical and is not conducive to the development of productive forces.

    Ideological revolution and technical revolution are two mutually dependent and mutually promoting aspects. Without the great liberation of thought, there can be no great technological innovation. The liberation of people's minds promotes technological innovation in production, and conversely, technological innovation in production promotes the liberation of people's minds. Such a cycle repeats itself, improving each time, which is the organic combination and continuous development process of ideological revolution and technical revolution.

    As Comrade Liu Shaoqi pointed out: "Actively implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction, and actively implementing the technical revolution and the cultural revolution, will greatly develop the social productive forces of our country." We believe that under the leadership of the Party, the technical revolution of industrial enterprises will be carried out more vigorously and vigorously.

    工业企业中的整风运动与技术革命
    中共湖北省委书记　张平化
    刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中提出：“在继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的同时，逐步实现技术革命和文化革命。”现在，这个新的革命性的历史任务，已经提到全党和全国人民的面前来了。
    从湖北地区的情况看，工业企业也正面临着这样一个新的历史时期。在这个时候，正确地认识整风运动与技术革命的内在联系，对于改善企业工作，是有重要意义的。
    整风运动为技术革命
    开辟了道路
    湖北地区的工业企业经过整风运动，普遍出现了新的气象。概括地说：干部作风大转变，群众觉悟大提高，生产建设大跃进。
    干部作风大转变：“三同”（同吃、同住、同劳动）和“试验田”等工作方法，已经形成风气。据武汉、黄石两市的不完全统计，企业中干部参加劳动的占80％。干部实行“三同”“参加生产、领导生产”，对改善领导人员与生产人员的关系收到了良好的效果。例如：武汉市某建筑工程公司的经理、副经理、党委书记等四人，原来住在一栋楼上，由于工作不深入，不接近群众，工人称他们为“四大家族”。他们实行“三同”之后，工人就和他们亲如家人。这个公司的经理搬到工地去拜师学徒的时候，头三天工人不理他，后来看到经理早起扫地、打开水，同医务所研究除臭虫，同工会商量垫钱给工人买蚊帐，并且及时解决了一些施工管理问题和各工地之间的协作问题，工人很受感动，他们说：“过去我们不知道那个是经理，现在经理同我们一块劳动，一块睡觉，这是从来没有的事”。又如：公安县邮电局支部书记刘瑞祥，过去不接近群众，好给工人“刮胡子”（人家找上门来，不理睬人），工人叫他“理发书记”；实行“三同”以后，他包送十五公里邮路的邮件，并且参加架线，下雨天穿着蓑衣送报送信，现在工人称他为“劳动书记”。领导干部带头，同技术人员和生产工人相结合，搞“试验车间”“试验工段”和“一条龙试验”的事例，举不胜举。
    群众觉悟大提高：从前闹工资的，现在提出“不赶上英国不增加工资”；从前领着部分工人向工会请愿反对修改定额的，现在向群众动员、解释修改定额的合理性；从前把机床偷出去到地下工厂做私活的，现在利用废料制成新的专用机床，提高工效几倍。群众的积极性和创造性，在整风运动中，特别在“双反”阶段，表现得非常明显。发明创造和改进技术设备、改进操作方法、改善劳动组织的合理化建议，比过去任何时期都多、许多无名的“小人物”成了出色的革新家。例如汉阳机器厂的工人高普贤，只念过八个月书，从十二岁起就“天聋地哑”，十三岁开始做工，素来被人瞧不起。经过整风运动，他也积极参加技术革新，利用废料制成一部自动锯钢机，减轻了工人的劳动强度，大大提高了锯钢效率。
    生产建设大跃进：今年的生产高潮，比1956年的生产高潮规模更大。
    我省1956年工业产值比1955年增长31％。这是第一个五年计划期间增长最大的一年。1957年受了1956年下半年反“冒进”的影响，比1956年只增长了18％。今年工业产值有很大可能比1957年增长50％以上。
    今年地方工业发展的速度有很大的提高，南宁会议和成都会议对地方工业起了很大的促进作用，许多县在今年短短几个月内，就办起了数百个或一千多个小厂。许多原有的企业，今年的产值可以增加一倍到两倍以上。在南宁会议以前，我们开始考虑第二个五年计划时，地方工业的资金只能筹集两亿元左右，现在1958年一年即可投资五亿到六亿元。我们初步估算，第二个五年计划期间，地方工业可以投资四十亿元以上。五年到七年基本上可以实现农业的机械化和半机械化。五年到七年全省地方工业总产值可以赶上或超过农业总产值。
    以上的情况表明，经过整风运动，进一步改善了生产关系，进一步解放了生产力，为技术革命创造了极其有利的条件；同时，经过整风运动，出现了生产大跃进的形势，必须开展大规模的技术革命运动，才能同多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线相适应。在技术革命运动中继续巩固
  和发展整风运动的成果
    现在企业中的整风运动还没有结束，而技术革命运动已经开始；不断发展的革命，由一个阶段进到另一个阶段。在这种形势下，既要把整风运动进行到底，使之获得全胜，又要使技术革命运动及时展开，以适应社会主义建设大跃进的新形势。因此，我们必须把整风运动的经验创造性地运用于技术革命运动，在技术革命运动中使整风运动的成果得到巩固和发扬光大。
    整风运动成果是非常丰硕的，在这里，我想着重说说两个互相联系着的重要成果：（一）是发展了党的群众路线的光荣传统；（二）是破除了许多迷信，解放了人们的思想。
    在工业企业中，要不要党委的领导，要不要群众路线，这是多年来争论的焦点。有人曾经有过一种想法和说法，认为中央关于领导方法的决定只适合于农村和农业，而不适合于城市和工业；把“由点到面，点面结合”、“登门拜访、个别串连”等一系列的群众路线的方法，讥之为“农村观点”“游击习气”。党的八届代表大会第一次会议，正式肯定了在工业企业中必须实行党委领导下的厂长负责制，必须实行党的集体领导和个人负责相结合，领导骨干和广大群众相结合的原则，随后党中央又确定了在工业企业中实行党委领导下的群众监督制，即职工代表大会制。最近几年来，党在工业企业中的领导加强了，群众路线的方法比较“吃得开”了。经过这次伟大的整风运动和反右斗争，采取了大鸣大放、大整大改、大争大辩、大字报等形式，进一步加强和巩固了党的领导，发展了群众路线的工作方法。从而在企业中出现了崭新的局面。
    在技术革命运动中起决定作用的，仍然是党的领导和群众路线。“外行不能领导内行”“群众的科学技术和文化水平低，因此，科学技术工作不能走群众路线”的观点，原来就有，在技术革命时期，这种错误观点可能重新抬头。实际经验证明：不但外行能够领导内行，而且外行领导内行是一般的正常的规律。科学工作、技术工作，也同其他工作一样，必须从群众中来到群众中去。科学工作者、技术工作者，只有在党的领导下同工农群众相结合，才能发挥他们应有的作用。
    在这里我想举一个例子：大冶钢厂的优质钢，在1955年以前，质量很坏，退货的很多，许多兄弟厂矿不愿用大冶钢厂的钢，该厂的销售人员在订货会议上不敢通名报姓。该厂电炉车间的工人说：“我们的名誉，顶风还要臭四十里”，技术人员表示没有办法，一心依赖苏联专家，苏联专家来过几次，提过不少的建议，专家在时也炼过几炉较好的钢，专家一走又毫无办法。1955年秋，大冶钢厂党委和行政领导同志，决心眼睛向下，进行调查研究，依靠群众，摸清关键，提出措施，召开生产技术代表会议（即职工代表大会）讨论和补充修改了厂长提出的方案，统一了思想，然后上下一致贯彻执行，优质钢的质量大有好转。1956年秋，他们又组织干部认真学习了“改造我们的学习”“中央关于领导方法的决定”和“八大”文件，并且联系实际检查工作，来了一次“小整风”，然后在这个整风的基础上，发动群众，总结先进的技术操作经验，修订技术规程，不但在技术规程的内容上力求同实际情况和群众经验相结合，而且在文字形式上也力求通俗化，使之同工人的文化程度和习惯用语相适应；如把炉“倾斜”多少度写成炉“歪”多少度，把“可断性”试验写成“打弯”试验等。经过修订技术规程之后，再开训练班，订师徒合同，互教互学合同，开展学习规程，贯彻规程的群众运动。对于贯彻苏联专家的建议，也采取了实事求是和群众路线的方法。例如，当时优质钢的主要毛病是“皮下气泡”和“蜂窝气泡”，苏联专家已经查明造成“气泡”的主要原因是钢中含氢气过多，并提出了一些去氢的方法。但是，氢气在冶炼和铸锭的过程中，具体的活动情况怎样呢，尚待进一步证明。因此，他们改变了过去“不动脑筋，吃现成饭”的态度，首先在二号电炉进行重点试验，领导干部、技术人员和生产工人密切结合，组织试验组，采取“统一领导，分工合作，重点分析、全面总结”的方法，对每一个工序，每一个工人的操作方法，每一个部分的设备情况，都进行了周密的研究，经过四十多炉的试验，找到了科学的数据，找到了氢气在冶炼和铸锭过程中的活动规律。经过这样的试验研究，补充了专家的建议，才真正贯彻了专家建议，解决了生产关键问题。由此可见，任何高明的技术人员，只有在党的领导下，同实践结合，同群众结合，才能发挥积极作用。现在大冶钢厂的优质钢，已经是真正的“优质”钢了，工人说：“质量翻了身，订货单上门”，质量合格率1957年在全国平均是99.54％，超过了国家规定的指标，电炉车间有不少的班、组的质量合格率是百分之百。这个厂的优质钢“质量翻身”的主要经验，是在生产技术工作上走了群众路线。
    保守思想和守旧的习惯是技术革命的主要障碍，现在我们厂矿中的技术规程及其他有关的规章制度，有从外国搬来的，有从旧中国因袭下来的，也有从群众的实践经验中总结起来的。不用说，前两种，不经过修改补充就不能切合现实的情况；即是第三种，如果不在一定时期加以适当的修订，也将落后于技术革新和生产发展的要求。有些厂矿提出了“打破迷信，打破保守，大胆创造，大胆试验”的口号，我们认为这些口号是正确的，是符合毛主席所教导我们的“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的精神的。
    在整风运动中，已经打破了许多迷信，敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格大为提高。但是，技术神秘论，迷信陈规陋习的精神状态还在一些人当中存在。在技术革命运动中，还必须遵照毛主席迭次的指示，彻底破除迷信，振奋职工群众和新老干部的大无畏的创造精神。
    开展技术革命要反对经验主义和教条主义
    在技术革命的斗争中，必须反对经验主义，经验主义的表现之一是：对于企业的情况缺乏全面的系统的分析。把生产技术上的各个问题孤立起来看，用头痛医头脚痛医脚的办法去处理，结果是顾此失彼，甚至越理越乱。有时候，表面上“解决”了一个“关键”问题，不要几天，又发生“关键”回头的现象。经验主义的另一个表现是“轻视科学技术，不学习科学技术，不重视技术人员，不注意培养和扩大科学技术队伍，对于新技术、新经验采取冷淡态度，以为只凭自己的一套老经验就可以把一切事情办好。不纠正经验主义的错误，就根本谈不到技术革命。
    在技术革命的斗争中，也必须反对教条主义。教条主义在企业中，尤其是在大企业中的影响是相当严重的。武汉有一个工厂，没有从本厂的实际出发，而机械地袭用了大本的工艺规程，工人说，“提起工艺规程就头痛”，“有小说那样厚，可又没有小说那样吸引人”。工艺文件的冗长和工艺线路的繁琐，妨碍着生产力的发展。车间里如果临时需要一个简单的工具，就必须经过本车间、工具科，工艺科、供应科、材料库、生产科、备料车间、中央工具库等八个单位，办十一道手续。有一次，车间里急需几件简单的辅助工具，竟花了一百二十天的时间，在上述八个部门之间旅行，机床闲着，工人等着，工人说：“急惊风遇着了慢郎中”，“有干劲没用处”。编制工艺的人，缺乏操作经验又不熟悉设备情况，只好抄书本。一个立式车床长丝杆的加工工艺，编写了八开纸三十三页之多，实际上只要前面三页工艺过程卡片就够了，却偏要写上许多不必要的废话，使人头痛。所以工人说：“这是伤风感冒的工艺”。在整风运动中，工人对规章制度问题贴了许多大字报，厂党委和行政领导同志，最近又在一些车间进行重点试验，证明规章制度可以大加修改，工艺过程也可以适当简化。例如中小件车间，吸收技术工人编工艺，原来六个工件的工艺共有二百零七页，工人改编为一十五页；另外三个工件，按原来编制的工艺要经过五十四道工序，经工人编改后，只要三十三道。这个车间采取这种“群众编工艺”的办法之后，编制工艺的工作量减少了80％，节省纸张81％，节省工人看工艺文件的时间75％，节省加工的准备时间和终结时间42％。因而使生产周期大大缩短，产量大大增加。
    在整风运动中，特别是在“双反”阶段，几乎没有哪一个企业不揭露一些规章制度不合理的现象，同时，只要发动群众，对规章制度作了某些合理的修改，就能够有效的推动生产力的发展。例如中南工业设计院，在整风以前，教条主义的毛病相当大，用他们自己的话说，就是“三搬”——一搬外国设计；二搬大厂到小厂；三搬技规范条文。他们设计一个并不很大的衡阳钻机厂的时候，也像设计大厂一样，划分了厂前区、车间区、仓库区、福利区、主干道、次干道、中轴线等等。他们按照“车间越是合并越经济”的说法，把该厂的工具、机修、电修、热处理、装配等车间和试造工段，设计为一个大的联合车间，而衡阳钻机厂的厂址是一个丘陵地带，按照这个设计就得削平山地，增加了大量的土方工程，并且车间合并后，就要提高防火等级，提高造价。在整风运动中，他们抓住了这个典型例子，检查设计思想，批判教条主义，修改规章制度，在这以后，他们设计的工厂就大大节省了投资。例如老河口烤胶厂原计划的土建投资可建同样的两个半厂；株洲化工厂原计划的土建投资可建同样的五个厂。
    我们强调党的群众路线，决不是轻视技术和技术人员的作用。恰恰相反，我们强调党的群众路线，正是为了更有效地发挥技术的威力，更充分地发挥技术人员的积极作用，更多更快更好更省地培养又红又专的技术人材。我们认为必须使领导干部、技术人员和生产工人这三种“元素”密切结合，才能形成有力的技术队伍。
    我们强调破除迷信和思想解放，决不是不相信科学。恰恰相反，迷信和科学是不相容的。真正相信科学的人，是不信神、不信鬼、不怕天、不怕地的。他们敢于利用自然规律去战胜自然，敢于扫除各种障碍去改造世界。他们对于科学，不抱神秘观点，相信科学是实践经验的总结，是人类劳动的结晶，只有经得起实践考验的科学，才是真正的科学。他们敢于吸收实践的新经验来补充和发展科学理论，敢于抛弃一切不切合实际和不利于生产力发展的东西。
    思想革命和技术革命是互相依存互相促进的两方面。没有思想的大解放，就不可能有技术的大革新。人们的思想解放，促进了生产的技术革新，反过来，生产的技术革新，又促使人们的思想解放。如此循环往复，一次比一次提高，这就是思想革命与技术革命的有机结合和不断发展的过程。
    正如刘少奇同志所指出的：“积极实现党的社会主义建设的总路线，积极实现技术革命和文化革命，将使我国的社会生产力大大地发展起来。”我们相信，在党的领导下，工业企业的技术革命将会进一步轰轰烈烈、蓬蓬勃勃地开展起来。
