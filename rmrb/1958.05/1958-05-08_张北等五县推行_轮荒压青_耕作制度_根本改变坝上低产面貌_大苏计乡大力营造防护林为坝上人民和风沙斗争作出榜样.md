    This newspaper reports that this year, Zhangbei, Guyuan, Kangbao, Shangdu, Shangyi and five other counties on the Bashang Plateau began to implement the "fallow rotation and green manure" cultivation system reform. This is a measure proposed by the Zhangjiakou Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture to fundamentally change the extensive and low-yielding nature of farmland cultivation in the five counties of Bashang.
    Now, the counties, townships, and communes of these five counties have ranked the land into good, medium, and poor, and have determined that a total of 1.45 million mu of "extremely poor land" and "wind-prone land" should undergo "fallow rotation and green manure," accounting for more than 15% of the total cultivated land area of the five counties. The five counties on the Bashang Plateau have a lot of wind and sand, and have always been a well-known low-yielding area in Hebei Province due to a serious shortage of labor (each laborer is responsible for nearly 40 mu of cultivated land).
    In the past, these lands generally yielded 60 to 70 jin per mu in good years, and only a dozen jin per mu if they encountered some wind or drought disasters. Some even failed to recover the seeds. After adopting the "fallow rotation and green manure" measures, a large amount of labor, fertilizer, and seeds can be concentrated on certain cultivated land to achieve intensive cultivation and increase unit yield and total output. According to Zhangbei County's calculations, the 300,000 mu of land undergoing "fallow rotation and green manure" this year will seem to result in a reduction of 24 million jin of grain based on the past average yield of 80 jin per mu. However, the 900,000 units of labor (calculated at three per mu) and 600 million jin of fertilizer (calculated at an average of 2,000 jin per mu) saved from these lands and applied to other cultivated land can increase production by 30 million jin of grain, exceeding the total output of these lands by 6 million jin. At the same time, 3 million jin of seeds will also be saved. This year, Zhangbei County is confident in achieving an average yield of 400 jin per mu and a total output of 420 million jin, exceeding the Leap Forward plan of three times last year's total output, due to the adoption of this measure, coupled with heavy watering and heavy fertilization. The implementation of "fallow rotation and green manure" will also facilitate the grazing of livestock and promote the development of animal husbandry production in these counties. The Bashang area has always had the habit of "fallow rotation and green manure," so the farmers here have a saying: "Plant green manure, and eat like it's the mid-autumn festival." However, in the past era of individual management, this experience did not develop much. Only today can the reform of this new cultivation system be smoothly realized. (Li Pu)

    This newspaper reports that the farmers of Dasuji Township in Shangyi County, Hebei Province, located outside the Great Wall at an altitude of 1,500 meters, spent just over half a month afforesting more than 8,180 mu of land, forming eighteen crisscrossing shelterbelts (each 50 meters wide, composed of 30 rows of trees such as poplar, elm, and apricot) across the township to resist the northwest wind and sand. The village-encircling forest belts and marsh protection forests of ten villages have also been basically formed. Currently, they are focusing on creating attached forest belts and road protection forests, striving to complete the afforestation plan of more than 25,000 mu this year. This event is insignificant in the mainland of the motherland, but it is a remarkable feat in an area where the frost-free period is only more than 100 days each year and where trees have never been planted before.
    Dasuji Township has more than 30,000 mu of sloping beam and wind-prone land, accounting for more than 60% of the total cultivated land area. The wind and sand disasters in spring and autumn every year bring great difficulties to production and life. As a result, the yield per mu has dropped from more than 100 jin to 50 or 60 jin. In 1935, a strong wind blew continuously for 40 days from the beginning of summer, killing the first crop of seedlings, and the second crop could not be planted, leaving large areas of farmland idle for a year. The wind and sand caused more than 30 of the 200 households in Dasuji Village to flee famine and beg in other places. The wind and sand submerged fertile grasslands, seriously affecting the breeding and development of cattle and sheep. In Bayijing Village, 160 sheep starved to death in one year due to lack of feed.
    After liberation, the Party and the government have been leading the farmers to fight against wind and sand disasters. In recent years, Dasuji Township has created more than 2,000 mu of shelterbelts, which have played a certain role in preventing wind and fixing sand to protect the harvest of farmland. However, the forest area is small and has not been able to completely eliminate the wind and sand disasters. In order to get rid of the disasters of wind and sand forever, the Shangyi County Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the slogan of "Great Leap Forward in Forestry Production" this year. After the masses were mobilized, the afforestation progressed rapidly. (Li Pu) (Attached image)

### 张北等五县推行“轮荒压青”耕作制度  根本改变坝上低产面貌  大苏计乡大力营造防护林为坝上人民和风沙斗争作出榜样

    张北等五县推行“轮荒压青”耕作制度
    根本改变坝上低产面貌
    大苏计乡大力营造防护林为坝上人民和风沙斗争作出榜样
    本报讯　今年坝上张北、沽源、康保、商都、尚义等五县开始实行“轮荒压青”的耕作制度改革。这是中共张家口地委在农业大跃进的新形势下提出的，根本改变坝上五县农田耕作粗放和低产面貌的措施。
    现在这五个县的县、乡、社已将土地按好、中、坏排队，确定“轮荒压青”的“极薄地”和“犯风地”共一百四十五万亩，占五县总耕地面积的15％以上。坝上五县风沙很多，一向又因劳力严重不足（每个劳动力负担近四十亩耕地）成为河北省知名的低产地区。
    在过去，这些地一般好年头亩产六、七十斤，少微遇上一些风、旱灾害，亩产仅十几斤，有的甚至连籽种也收不回来。采用“轮荒压青”措施后，就可以腾出大批人工，大量肥料、种籽等集中用在一定的耕地上，作到精耕细作，提高单位产量和总产量。据张北县计算，今年“轮荒压青”的三十万亩土地，按过去平均亩产八十斤说，好像少收二千四百万斤粮食，可是从这些地上省出的九十万个人工（按每亩三个计）和六亿斤肥料（按平均每亩二千斤计），用于其它耕地，就可增产三千万斤粮食，超过这些地总产量六百万斤，同时还节省籽种三百万斤。张北县今年因为采取了这个措施，再加上大水大肥等，平均亩产量可达到四百斤，总产四亿二千万斤，超过去年总产量三倍的跃进计划就有把握实现。实行“轮荒压青”还能便利牲畜的牧放，促进这几县畜牧生产的发展。坝上地区历来就有“轮荒压青”的习惯，所以这里的农民曾有“种地种压青，拿干粮拿月饼”的说法。但在过去个体经营时代，这种经验没有得到多大发展。只有到今天才使这个新的耕作制度的改革能顺利实现。　（李朴）
    本报讯　河北省塞外海拔一千五百公尺的尚义县大苏计乡的农民，仅用半个多月的时间，造林八千一百八十多亩，在全乡土地上形成纵横交叉抵抗西北风沙的十八条林带（每带宽五十公尺，由杨、榆、杏等树三十行组成），十个村的环村林带和护淖林也已基本形成。目前正突击营造附林带和护路林，争取今年完成二万五千多亩的造林计划。这个事例在祖国内地是微不足道的，可是在每年仅有无霜期一百多天，历来又没有种过树的地区，却是一件了不起的壮举。
    大苏计乡有占总耕地面积60％以上的坡梁犯风地三万多亩，年年春秋两季的风沙灾害，给生产和生活带来极大的困难。亩产量因此由百多斤降到五、六十斤。1935年从立夏节起一直刮了四十天的大风，头遍苗刮死，二遍苗也没种成，大片农田闲了一年。风沙使二百多户人家的大苏计村有三十多户逃荒要饭流落他乡。风沙淹没了肥沃的草滩，严重影响了牛羊的繁殖和发展，八义井村有一年因为没有饲草，一次饿死了一百六十多只羊。
    解放后，党和政府一直在领导农民和风沙灾害进行斗争，几年来大苏计乡营造防护林二千多亩，在防风固沙保护农田丰收上，起到一定作用。但树林面积小，没能把风沙灾害彻底消除。为了永远摆脱风沙的灾害，中共尚义县委今年提出“林业生产大跃进”的口号，群众发动起来之后，造林进展迅速。　（李朴）（附图片）
