Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 21st: More than 8.3 million illiterate and semi-literate people in Shandong Province have enrolled in literacy classes, accounting for over 70% of the total number of illiterate people in the province.

In the past two months, the development of anti-illiteracy work in Shandong Province has advanced by leaps and bounds. From farmers to workers, a wave of enthusiasm for learning culture has been set off. Coal mines, which have the most illiterate workers and face the most learning difficulties, are now taking measures to ensure anti-illiteracy work. The Hongshan Coal Mine's anti-illiteracy work progressed slowly in the past, but now a literacy command has been established, and sixteen hours of spare time are set aside each week for literacy work. According to statistics at the end of April, there are twenty-five counties and cities, including Liaocheng Prefecture and Changdao, Jining, and Yantai, where over 90% of young and middle-aged illiterate people have enrolled in literacy classes.

The characteristics of Liaocheng Prefecture's anti-illiteracy work are: unified leadership arrangements; deep and broad ideological mobilization; large scale; fast speed; anti-illiteracy serving production, production driving anti-illiteracy, combining mobilization and consolidation, and equal emphasis on quantity and quality. In Pingyuan County of this prefecture, from the county party secretary to grassroots cadres, literate people are serving as literacy teachers, and illiterate people are students, forming a literacy movement of "ten thousand teaching, the whole people learning." After the county set off a wave of enrollment, it then set off a wave of innovation in teaching. In just three months, more than 50,000 illiterate and semi-literate people have reached the level of literacy graduation, and sixteen townships have basically achieved the goal of having no illiterate young and middle-aged people. The experiences of "secretary taking the lead, four chiefs (county, township, commune, team leader) responsible, departmental collaboration, and the entire party mobilized" and closely integrating literacy with production, as well as the mass line working methods created by Pingyuan County and Xin County in anti-illiteracy work, have greatly promoted local anti-illiteracy work. In order to promote this advanced experience, the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shandong Provincial Department of Education recently held an on-site anti-illiteracy work conference in Encheng Town, Pingyuan County.

This newspaper reports: According to the Southern Daily, workers at the Gongjilong Silk Weaving Factory in Foshan City, Guangdong, have become a factory without illiterate people after twenty-three days of hard work.

After the factory put forward the fighting slogan of "cooperating with the technical revolution, fighting hard for twenty-five days, becoming an illiterate-free factory, and dedicating gifts to May Day" in early April, it quickly set off an upsurge of learning culture. During rest periods, workers in the workshop, canteen, and dormitory, in groups of two or three, taught and learned from each other, asking about characters and people, everywhere was a classroom, and the sound of reading resounded throughout. Many workers learned two to three hundred characters in one night. At present, 105 illiterate and semi-literate people in the factory have learned 2,000 characters, of which 79 can write manuscripts and letters; in addition, 38 illiterate people know between 1,000 and 2,000 characters.

In terms of teaching methods, the factory used the object teaching method, so that workers learned characters by recognizing objects, turning objects into living textbooks. At the same time, they compiled a kind of homophone but different character literacy chart, starting from two hundred to seven hundred basic characters commonly used daily, finding homophones, and according to the principle of from shallow to deep, from simple to complex, generally linking five homophones into a group. For example, using the basic character "羊" (yang - sheep), they linked the four homophones 洋 (yang - ocean), 扬 (yang - raise), 杨 (yang - poplar), 阳 (yang - sun) into a group, and then blossomed into phrases, becoming the four phrases 海洋 (hai yang - ocean), 表扬 (biao yang - praise), 姓杨 (xing yang - surname Yang), 太阳 (tai yang - sun), using the familiar to bring along the unfamiliar, one character bringing ten characters. In the phrase-linking, they also paid attention to combining with production and politics, learning what to do and doing what to learn. In this way, the homophones of a basic character are about 1,200 characters, and then linking phrases gives 2,000 characters. In order to facilitate the masses' learning, they also implemented the methods of "delivering characters to the door" and "little teachers" contracted to be responsible.

In order to consolidate the workers' learning achievements, the factory is now preparing to open a senior primary school class, organizing workers who have graduated from literacy classes to continue learning; for workers who have not reached the standard of literacy graduation, they will make another fifteen-day sprint to recognize 2,000 characters.

    山东扫盲工作突飞猛进
    广东佛山公记隆厂一片读书声
    据新华社济南21日电　山东全省已有八百三十多万文盲、半文盲入学，占全省文盲总数的70％以上。
    近两个月来，山东省扫盲工作的发展突飞猛进。从农民到工人都掀起了学习文化的热潮。煤矿是职工文盲最多、学习困难也多的部门，现在许多煤矿都采取措施，保证扫盲工作。洪山煤矿过去扫盲工作进展迟缓，现在成立了扫盲指挥部，每周拿出十六小时业余时间进行扫盲。到4月底的统计，全省现有青壮年文盲入学达到90％以上的，有聊城专区以及长岛、济宁、烟台等二十五个县、市。
    聊城专区扫盲工作的特点是：领导统一安排；思想发动作得又深又广，规模大；速度快；扫盲服务生产，生产带动扫盲，发动与巩固结合，数量质量并重。这个专区的平原县，从县委书记到基层干部，识字的人都当了扫盲教师，不识字的人都当学生，形成了“万人教、全民学”的识字运动。全县在掀起入学高潮之后，接着又掀起了革新教学的高潮，在短短的三个月中，就有五万多文盲半文盲达到扫盲毕业水平，有十六个乡基本上实现了青壮年无盲乡。平原县和莘县在扫盲工作中创造的“书记动手，四长（县、乡、社、队长）负责，部门协作，全党动员”和扫盲紧密结合生产的经验以及群众路线的工作方法，大大推动了当地的扫盲工作。为推广这种先进经验，中共山东省委宣传部和山东省教育厅最近曾在平原县恩城镇召开了扫盲工作现场会议。
    本报讯　据南方日报报道：广东佛山市公记隆丝织厂职工，经过二十三天苦战，已成为没有文盲的工厂。
    这个厂在4月初提出“配合技术大革命，苦战二十五天，成为无文盲厂，向五一节献礼”的战斗口号后，很快就掀起一个学文化热潮。工人在休息时间，在车间、饭堂、宿舍里，三三两两，你教我学，见字问字，见人问人，处处是课室，一片读书声。很多工人一晚就认识二、三百字。目前全厂已有一百零五个文盲和半文盲认识二千字，其中有七十九人能写稿和写信；另外三十八个文盲识一千字以上二千字以下。
    这个厂在教学方法上，运用了实物教学法，使工人识物件就识字，把实物变成活课本。同时，他们自编了一种同音异字的识字表，从二百个到七百个日常基础用字入手，找同音字，根据由浅入深，由简到繁的原则，一般以五个同音字连成一组。如“羊”这个基础字，把洋、扬、杨、阳四个同音字联成一组，然后开花连词，成为海洋、表扬、姓杨、太阳四个词，以熟带生，一个字带十个字。在字联词中，又注意和生产、政治结合，做什么、学什么。这样一来，基础字一串同音便是一千二百字左右，再连词便有二千字。为了便利群众学习，还实行“送字上门”和“小先生”包干负责的方法。
    为了巩固工人的学习成绩，现在这个厂准备开办高小班，组织已经扫盲毕业的工人继续学习；对没有达到扫盲毕业标准的工人，将再突击十五天，做到认识二千字。
