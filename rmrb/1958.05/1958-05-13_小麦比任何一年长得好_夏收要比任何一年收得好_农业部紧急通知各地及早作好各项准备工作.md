The Ministry of Agriculture Issues Urgent Notice to All Localities to Make Various Preparations Early

　　This newspaper reports that the Ministry of Agriculture issued an urgent notice on summer harvesting work on May 13. The full text is as follows:

　　In the new upsurge of agricultural production since last winter, farmers across the country have actively watered and fertilized winter crops, strengthened field management, and cultivated large areas of high-yield fields. This year, wheat and other summer crops are growing better than in any previous year, and a bumper harvest is in sight. However, the bumper harvest is only secured after the grain is in the granary. Striving for a bumper summer harvest is of great significance for completing this year's great leap forward in grain production and further overcoming conservative thinking.

　　Except for a few areas in South China where winter wheat has already been harvested or is being harvested, the Yellow River Basin and the Yangtze River Basin, where wheat production is relatively concentrated, generally harvest around the time of Mangzhong (Grain in Ear). During the period from now until the harvest, all localities must continue to do a good job in field management before wheat harvest, pay special attention to preventing lodging, and prevent and control diseases and insect pests; at the same time, they must immediately mobilize to make all preparations for wheat harvest, truly bring in the well-grown wheat, and truly achieve fast harvesting and clean threshing, for a high-yield and bumper harvest. Wheat harvesting has always been a tense time, requiring rapid completion within a few days. Because the wheat harvest season often encounters moldy rain, suffering losses such as shedding, germination, and mildew. This year, wheat is growing well and yields are high, and the amount of labor required for harvesting is also greatly increased compared to previous years. At the same time, many places have expanded the planting of rice, increased multiple cropping, and the field management of spring-sown crops cannot be relaxed. Summer harvesting is followed closely by summer planting. These situations determine that the summer harvest work is a tense battle.

　　In order to truly ensure a bumper harvest of wheat, it is necessary to start early and prepare harvesting tools, threshing tools, transportation tools, threshing grounds, as well as rain and wind protection equipment and storage equipment for the threshing grounds. It is necessary to fully mobilize the masses, promote the wisdom of the masses, improve and create various tools, improve labor efficiency, and shorten the time for harvesting and threshing. And it is necessary to harvest as the wheat ripens, achieving four "fasts" (fast harvesting, fast binding, fast hauling, fast threshing) and four "cleans" (clean harvesting in the fields, clean threshing on the grounds, clean winnowing of the wheat grains, clean gleaning of the wheat ears), improving the quality of the harvest and reducing all losses.

　　Summer harvesting, summer planting, and field management of spring-sown crops are all squeezed together, so rationally arranging labor is an important link. It is necessary to do a good job in labor planning, organize all the labor forces that can be mobilized into the production of the summer harvest season, with men and women, old and young, working together to fully exploit labor potential, organize mutual support between townships, between communes, between plains and mountainous areas, and organize the forces of urban residents, institutions, schools, and troops to help farmers with summer harvesting.

　　During the wheat harvest, it is also necessary to do a good job in seed selection and retention, select and retain enough wheat seeds for the next season, and prepare for the bumper wheat harvest next year. In early May, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee held an on-site meeting in Gucheng County attended by the first secretaries of all county party committees, to visit, learn, and summarize the experience of high-yield summer harvest crops, and to arrange for autumn planting this year, making early preparations for a bumper harvest of summer harvest crops next year. Hebei, Shandong, and Zhejiang have also adopted this approach. This practice can be followed by other localities.

### 小麦比任何一年长得好  夏收要比任何一年收得好  农业部紧急通知各地及早作好各项准备工作

　　小麦比任何一年长得好  夏收要比任何一年收得好
    农业部紧急通知各地及早作好各项准备工作
    本报讯　农业部于五月十三日发出关于夏收工作的紧急通知。全文如下：
    在去年冬季以来的农业生产新高潮中，全国各地农民对于越冬作物积极进行了浇水追肥，加强了田间管理，培养了大面积丰产田。今年小麦和其他夏收作物生长得比以往任何一年都好，丰收在望。但是，必须粮食上囤以后，丰收才算定局。力争夏季丰收，对于完成今年粮食生产大跃进的任务和进一步克服保守思想，都具有重要的意义。
    除了华南少数地区冬麦已经收割或正在收割以外，产麦比较集中的黄河流域和长江流域，一般在芒种前后收割。从现在到收割这一段时间内，各地必须继续做好麦收前的田间管理，特别注意防止倒伏，防治病虫害；同时，必须立即动员起来，做好麦收的一切准备工作，把长得好的麦子真正收到手，确实做到收得快，打得净，丰产丰收。收麦历来是紧张的，要在几天之内抢收完毕。因为麦收季节常遇霉雨，遭受落粒、发芽、霉烂等损失。今年小麦长得好，产量高，收获所需的劳动量也比往年大大增加，同时今年许多地方扩种了水稻，增加了复种，春播作物的田间管理不能放松，夏收紧接着还要抢夏种，这些情况决定了夏收工作是一场紧张的战斗。
    为了确实保证小麦丰产丰收，必须及早动手，准备好收割工具、脱粒工具、运输工具、打麦场以及麦场的防雨防风设备和仓储设备。要充分发动群众，发扬群众的智慧，改良和创造各种工具，提高劳动效率，缩短收割和脱粒的时间。并且要黄一片收一片，做到四快（快收、快捆、快拉、快打），四净（地里收净、场上打净、麦粒扬净、麦穗拾净），提高收获质量，减少一切损失。
    夏收夏种和春播作物的田间管理挤在一起，合理安排劳力就是一个重要环节。必须做好劳动规划，把一切能动员的劳动力量都组织到夏收季节的生产中去，男女老少齐动手，充分发挥劳动潜力，组织乡与乡、社与社、平原与山区之间的相互支援，并且组织城镇居民、机关、学校和部队的力量，帮助农民进行夏收。
    在麦收时，还要做好选种留种工作，选好留够下季小麦种子，为明年的小麦丰收做好准备。中共湖北省委五月上旬在谷城县召开全省各县委第一书记参加的现场会议，参观学习和总结夏收作物的丰产经验，布置今年秋播，为明年夏收作物大丰收早作准备。河北、山东、浙江也采取了这样的作法。这种作法各地可以仿行。
