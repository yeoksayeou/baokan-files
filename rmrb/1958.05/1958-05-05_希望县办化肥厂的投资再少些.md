    Hoping for Further Reduction in Investment for County-Run Fertilizer Plants
    Recently, your newspaper has continuously reported news of the central industrial departments vigorously supporting local industries, such as the "Ministry of Chemical Industry Rushes to Produce Standardized Designs for Small Nitrogen Fertilizer Plants," which is truly inspiring. The reason we are so concerned is, first, that it presents a goal for local industry, pointing out that counties can run them, townships can run them, and communes can also run them; second, it has revealed the bottom line to the localities, providing introductions to the amount of investment, design details, construction time, raw material sources, and so on. This can help localities make arrangements and plans, especially financial planning. This year, in addition to expanding and building some new factories and mines, our county is trying to raise 3.5 million yuan as capital for a county-run nitrogen fertilizer plant. We hope that these designs can be completed as soon as possible, and we also hope that the investment in the design of county-level nitrogen fertilizer plants can be further reduced to suit the financial resources of local areas.

    希望县办化肥厂的投资再少些
    最近你报陆续地报道了中央各工业部门大力支援地方办工业的消息，例如“化学工业部赶制小型氮肥厂定型设计”等消息，真是振奋人心。我们所以这样关心，第一，它给地方工业上提出了一个奋斗目标，指出县可办，乡可办，社也可办；第二，给地方上交了个底；对投资多少、设计情况、建筑的时间、原料来源等等都作了介绍。这样就可以帮助地方上安排和规划，特别是资金上的规划。今年我们县里除了扩建和新建一些厂矿外，正在设法筹集三百五十万元作为县办氮肥厂的资金。我们除了希望这些设计能尽早完成以外，还希望对县级氮肥厂的设计投资能再降低一些，以适应地方办的财力。
