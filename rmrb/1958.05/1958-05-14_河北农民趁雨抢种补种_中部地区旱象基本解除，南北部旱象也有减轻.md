Hebei Farmers Seize the Opportunity of Rain to Rush Planting and Replanting
Drought in Central Region Basically Eliminated, Drought in North and South Also Reduced

(Our Newspaper News) From the 8th to the 10th, Hebei Province generally received welcome rain. The rainfall was greater in the central Baoding and Shijiazhuang regions, and the drought was basically eliminated. The rainfall was smaller in the south and north, and the drought was also reduced. After the rain, from inside and outside the Great Wall in the north, to the banks of the Zhang and Wei Rivers in the south, from the foothills of the Taihang Mountains in the west, to the coast of the Bohai Sea in the east, the vast number of farmers launched an intense battle of rushing planting, replanting, and wheat management.

Before the rain stopped, leading bodies at all levels organized work teams to go deep into the countryside and launch rushing planting and replanting activities together with the vast number of farmers. According to statistics from thirty-eight counties including Dingxian, Anguo, Luanxian, Yongqing, Dacheng, Cheng'an, and Pingquan, more than 2,050,000 full and half laborers were invested in rushing planting, replanting, and wheat management. In Dingxian County, about 200,000 full and half laborers transplanted about 60,000 mu of sweet potato seedlings in one day, which is equal to the total of transplanting in the week before the rain. Luanxian County, one of the key counties for oil crop production in the province, plans to plant 400,000 mu of peanuts this year. Due to the dry land before the rain, only 134,000 mu were completed; after the rain, the county organized 330 youth shock brigades and 228 women's shock brigades, totaling 8,130 people; it also formed 696 human-pulled plow shock brigades, totaling 14,300 people, and sowed more than 256,000 mu in three days. Now the peanut sowing task has been basically completed.

On the land that has been sown, people are intensively checking and replanting seedlings. In Cheng'an County, more than 50,000 farmers were involved in replanting cotton seedlings after the rain. In the misty rain, the farmers wore rain cloths and sacks, checking for missing seedlings and transplanting cotton plants as they went. In order to replenish all kinds of crops with seedlings, Boye County launched a "red flags all over the land" campaign after the rain. Red flags were inserted where the crop seedlings reached more than 90% and no more seedlings were replanted; blue flags were inserted below 90%, and white flags below 80%. The county invested more than 20,000 full and half laborers, rushed for two days, and finished the work on the third day, and now there are red flags all over the land.

While rushing planting, farmers also attached great importance to wheat field management, determined to strive for increased summer harvest and fire the first shot of this year's great leap forward in agricultural production in the province. In Anguo, Cheng'an and other counties with larger rainfall, wheat seedlings were lodged after the rain. All counties mobilized farmers to carry out wheat support activities. In order to achieve a bumper summer harvest, many places universally implemented topdressing for wheat.

On the basis of long-term drought resistance thinking, all localities are also actively striving for further water conservancy in the province. Cangxian region alone has drawn out 450,000 people to expand the irrigated area by more than 5 million mu on the existing water conservancy foundation.

　　河北农民趁雨抢种补种
    中部地区旱象基本解除，南北部旱象也有减轻
    本报讯　河北省8日到10日各地普降喜雨。中部保定、石家庄两专区雨量较大，旱象基本解除。南部、北部雨量较小，旱象也有减轻。雨后，北起长城内外，南到漳、卫河畔，西起太行山麓，东到渤海之滨，广大农民展开了抢种、补种和小麦管理的紧张战斗。
    未等雨停，各级领导机关就组织工作组，深入农村，和广大农民一道展开了抢种、补种活动。据定县、安国、滦县、永清、大城、成安、平泉等三十八县统计，投入抢种、补种和小麦管理的整半劳动力，就有二百零五万多人。定县全县约二十万个整半劳动力在一天时间，就插种甘薯秧六万亩左右，等于雨前一周插秧的总合。全省油料产地重点县之一的滦县，今年计划种花生四十万亩。雨前因土地干旱，只完成十三万四千多亩；雨后，全县组织了三百三十个青年突击队，二百二十八个妇女突击队，共八千一百三十多人；还组成了人拉犁的突击队六百九十六个，共一万四千三百多人，用三天时间播种二十五万六千多亩。现在花生播种任务已基本完成。
    在已经播种完毕的土地上，人们紧张地进行了查苗补苗，成安县在雨后投入补棉苗活动的农民达五万多人。在细雨蒙蒙中，农民们披着雨布、麻袋，随检查缺苗，随移植棉株。博野县为了把各种作物补全苗，在雨后开展了一个满地红旗运动。凡是作物苗达到九成以上的插红旗不再补苗，九成以下的插蓝旗，八成以下的插白旗。全县投入了两万多整半劳力，两天突击，一天扫尾，现在已经遍地红旗了。
    在抢种同时，农民们还很重视麦田管理，决心要争取夏收增产，打响今年全省农业生产大跃进的第一炮。雨量较大的安国、成安等县，雨后麦苗有倒伏现象，各县都发动农民展开了扶麦活动。为了取得夏季丰收，许多地方对小麦普遍实行了追肥。
    在长期抗旱的思想基础上，各地还积极为全省进一步水利化而努力。仅沧县专区即已抽出四十五万人，要在现有水利基础上，再扩大水地五百万亩以上。
