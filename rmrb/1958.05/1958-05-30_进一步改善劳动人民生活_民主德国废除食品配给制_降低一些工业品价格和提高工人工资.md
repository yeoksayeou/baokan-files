Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 28th (TASS): The People's Chamber and the Chamber of States of the German Democratic Republic held a joint meeting on the 28th to discuss and approve a bill submitted by the Council of Ministers to the two chambers on the abolition of food rationing and other measures aimed at further improving the people's living standards. Government members, headed by Prime Minister Grotewohl, attended the meeting.

    Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign and Intra-German Trade, Heinrich Rau, delivered a report at the meeting.

    He said that the increase in agricultural commodity products, the increase in industrial products, and the significant increase in labor productivity in the German Democratic Republic have made it possible to abolish food rationing. He said that the bill on the abolition of food rationing stipulates the elimination of the remnants of food rationing and determines a uniform price level for previously rationed foods. He also mentioned the need to reduce the prices of certain industrial goods and public utility charges, and to take measures to further improve the living standards of the working people by providing subsidies, raising wages, and implementing a series of new social measures, as well as stipulating new purchase prices for certain agricultural products.

    Heinrich Rau said that the growing economic and scientific and technological cooperation among the countries of the socialist camp, especially with the Soviet Union, has also played a major role in enabling the German Democratic Republic to take these measures.

    As a result of the implementation of these measures, the total income of employees in the German Democratic Republic will increase by 7.7% annually, and the purchasing power of the republic's residents will increase by 2.8 billion marks.

    Heinrich Rau emphasized that the measures stipulated in this regard are aimed at consolidating the foundation of the people's democratic system—the worker-peasant alliance—and promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture in the German Democratic Republic.

    After Heinrich Rau delivered his report, the joint meeting of the People's Chamber and the Chamber of States discussed the various bills submitted for consideration. As a result of the voting by the two chambers, unanimous agreement was reached on the decree on the complete abolition of food rationing from May 29 this year. (Attached picture)

    进一步改善劳动人民生活
    民主德国废除食品配给制
    降低一些工业品价格和提高工人工资
    新华社29日讯　据塔斯社柏林28日讯：德意志民主共和国人民议院和参议院28日举行联席会议，讨论并且通过了部长会议向两院提出的关于废除食品配给制的法案以及其他一些旨在进一步改善人民生活的措施。以格罗提渥总理为首的政府成员出席了会议。
    副总理兼对外和东西德贸易部长海因里希·劳在会上提出了报告。
    他说民主德国农业商品产品的增加、工业产品的增加和劳动生产率的大大提高使取消食品配给制成为可能。他说，关于废除食品配给制的法案规定取消食品配给制的残迹，并且确定以往配给的食品的统一价格水平。他还提到要降低若干工业品的价格以及公用事业的收费标准，采取措施，通过发放补贴、提高工资以及实现一系列新的社会措施，来进一步改善劳动人民的生活水平，规定若干农产品的新的收购价格。
    海因里希·劳说，社会主义阵营各国不断增长的经济和科学技术合作、特别是同苏联的合作在使民主德国能够采取这些措施方面也起了很大作用。
    由于实行上述这些措施的结果，民主德国职工的总收入每年将增加7.7％。并且使共和国居民的购买力提高二十八亿马克。
    海因里希·劳强调指出，在这方面规定的措施目的在于巩固人民民主制度的根基——工农联盟，并且促进德意志民主共和国农业的社会主义改造。
    在海因里希·劳作报告以后，人民议院和参议院联席会议讨论了提交会议考虑的各项法案。两院分别进行表决的结果，一致同意关于从今年5月29日起完全废除食品配给制的法令。（附图片）
