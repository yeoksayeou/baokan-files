Xinhua News Agency, May 15th, Paris Dispatch: The fascist rebellion launched by French far-rightists in Algeria continued to expand yesterday. In France itself, the situation is also very tense. Approximately 400,000 soldiers stationed throughout France have had all leave cancelled and have been ordered not to leave their barracks. Paris was under heavy guard all day yesterday by special police forces dealing with riots, and sentry posts were set up near all government agencies.

In Oran, Algeria's second-largest city, rioters occupied the radio station, shouting slogans demanding military rule, the rise of Algiers riot leader Massu, and the hanging of Lambert, the Oran province's administrator who is loyal to Paris. They also stormed his office building. A large number of police and troops stood by and did nothing to stop the rioters. Reports indicate that so-called "Committees of Public Safety" have been established in Oran, Bone, Constantine, Philippeville, and Guelma.

Massu, the chairman of the "Committee of Public Safety" established during the riots in Algiers and the commander of the French colonial army's paratroopers, expressed disappointment at a press conference yesterday with the appointment of Pflimlin as Prime Minister. He said that members of his "Committee of Public Safety" had hoped that Soustelle, the leader of the Social Republican Party (formerly the Gaullist party) and former Governor-General of Algeria, would come to Algiers, and that de Gaulle would emerge to lead a "government of public safety." At the same time, he defended his rebellious actions, saying that his "Committee of Public Safety" could not make any decisions and that everything had to be approved by Salan, the commander of the French army in Algeria.

In Paris, groups of fascists continued to demonstrate in the streets.

On the evening of May 13th, the Social Republican Party (formerly the Gaullist party) issued a statement calling on President Coty to allow de Gaulle to act as the "arbiter" of the current situation. The party's leader, Soustelle, along with Right-wing leaders of the Popular Republican Movement, Pierre Pflimlin, the leader of the Radical Socialist Party splinter faction, André Morice, and the leader of the "Independent Party," Duchet, issued a statement yesterday demanding Pflimlin's resignation in order to form a so-called "national union" government.

Faced with this serious situation, President Coty, in his capacity as head of state and supreme commander of the armed forces, called on the French army stationed in Algeria to obey government orders. Prime Minister Pflimlin, who had only been in office for six hours, also hurriedly made a radio address to the nation, asking the French people to trust him. He said that the government would ensure that the laws of the republic are respected. At the same time, he again assured that France would continue to maintain its colonial interests in Algeria and would never "sell out" Algeria.

Pflimlin also tried his best to seek the support of the Socialist Party and the right-wing party "Independent Party." He held consultations with Socialist Party leader Mollet and "Independent Party" leader Pinay on the issue of expanding the government's base. The Socialist Party decided last night to participate in the Pflimlin government. The "Independent Party" will make a decision at a later date. Reports indicate that the "Independent Party" is demanding that a more robust person replace Max Lejeune to implement a tougher Algeria policy. There are also reports that Pflimlin may agree to reinstate Lacoste, the former Resident Minister of Algeria, or appoint him as Minister of Defense. Observers believe that this is a concession to right-wingers, and even far-rightists.

At the same time, the Pflimlin government has banned the French Communist Party and other democratic forces from holding demonstrations to counter the fascist coup plot. It blockaded the site scheduled to hold a demonstration last night. Several thousand workers who were preparing to attend the meeting then shouted anti-fascist slogans and marched in formation towards the Place de la République. The police used force to deal with the demonstrators, and clashes occurred.

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement last night accusing the government of saying on the one hand that it wanted to defend the rule of law in the Republic, but on the other hand, it did not dare to strike at the most vicious enemies, but instead banned the working class and popular forces from holding anti-fascist demonstrations. The Communist Party warned the government not to compromise with the far-rightists who were creating riots in Algeria. It demanded: that immediate measures be taken to suppress the rebels; that Massu and other rebel leaders be removed from their posts and their actions declared illegal; that all conspirators in Paris, especially the masterminds Jacques Soustelle, be arrested and brought to court; that fascist groups and paramilitary groups be dissolved; that the military and police cadres be purged; and that democratic freedoms, especially the freedom of assembly and demonstration of the working people and all those who defend the Republic, be respected.

The Political Bureau's statement said that in the cause of defending freedom, the French working class and all defenders of the republican system should rely on their own strength, heighten their vigilance, and take concerted action.

French General Confederation of Labour General Secretary Frachon called on the entire French working class to take joint action in order to prevent fascism from succeeding. The League of Human Rights, the National Teachers' Union, and the National Education Federation jointly issued a statement exposing the fascists' conspiracy and calling on all supporters of the republican system to be vigilant.

Due to the seriousness of the situation, a group of politicians has established a "Vigilance Committee." Members of this committee include François Mitterrand (Democratic and Socialist Union of Resistance), Edgar Faure (Left Republican Union), Édouard Daladier (Radical Socialist Party), and Vincent Auriol (Radical Socialist Party). Mitterrand also spoke in the National Assembly yesterday, demanding that the government dissolve the "Committees of Public Safety" in Algeria.

　　法共警告政府不要同极右翼分子妥协
    要求采取措施镇压法西斯叛乱
    阿尔及利亚的暴乱继续扩大　法国局势正趋紧张
    新华社15日讯　巴黎消息：法国极右翼分子在阿尔及利亚发动的法西斯暴乱昨天继续扩大。在法国本土，局势也非常紧张。驻在法国各地的大约四十万士兵已经取消一切休假，奉令不得离开军营。巴黎昨天整天都处在专门对付暴动的特种警察的森严戒备中，各政府机关附近都布置了岗哨。
    在阿尔及利亚的第二大城市阿兰，暴乱者高呼着要求让军人执政、让阿尔及尔的暴乱头子马絮当权和绞死忠诚于巴黎方面的阿兰省行政长官朗贝尔的口号，占领了广播电台，并且冲进了他的办公大楼。大批警察和军队对暴乱者的作为袖手旁观。有消息说，在阿兰、波尼、君士坦丁、菲利普维尔和康兰廷，都已经成立了所谓“救国委员会”。
    在阿尔及尔的暴乱中成立的“救国委员会”主席、法国殖民军伞兵司令马絮昨天在记者招待会上对授命弗林姆兰当总理表示失望。他说，他的“救国委员会”的成员本来希望曾任阿尔及利亚总督的社会共和党（前戴高乐党）领袖苏斯戴尔会到阿尔及尔来，并且希望戴高乐出来领导“救国政府”。同时，他又为他的叛乱行为辩护，说他的“救国委员会”不能作出任何决定，一切事情都要由驻阿尔及利亚法军司令萨兰批准。
    在巴黎，仍然有成批的法西斯分子在大街上示威。
    社会共和党（前戴高乐党）13日晚上曾经发表声明，要求总统让戴高乐出来作当前局势的“裁决者”。这个党的领袖苏斯戴尔昨天又同人民共和党右翼领袖皮杜尔、激进社会党分裂派领袖安德烈·摩里斯和“独立党”领袖杜协一起发表声明，要求弗林姆兰辞职，以便成立一个所谓“全国联合”政府。
    处在这种严重的局势中，总统戈蒂以国家元首和三军最高统帅身份呼吁驻阿尔及利亚法军服从政府命令。上台只有六个钟头的总理弗林姆兰接着也慌忙向全国发表广播演说，要求法国人信任他。他说，政府将使共和国的法律得到尊重。同时，他又再次保证继续保持法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民利益，永远“不出卖”阿尔及利亚。
    弗林姆兰还竭力寻求社会党和右翼政党“独立党”的支持。他同社会党领袖摩勒和“独立党”领袖比内就扩大政府基础的问题进行了会商。社会党已经在昨天晚上决定参加弗林姆兰政府。而“独立党”则要在迟些时候再作决定。有消息说，“独立党”要求让一个更强悍的人来代替缪特去执行更加强硬的阿尔及利亚政策。还有消息说，弗林姆兰可能答应让上届阿尔及利亚驻节部长拉戈斯特复任，或者担任国防部长，观察家认为，这是对右翼分子，甚至极右翼分子，作出让步。
    同时，弗林姆兰政府却禁止法国共产党和其他民主力量举行示威以反击法西斯政变阴谋。它封锁了预定在昨天晚上举行示威大会的会址。准备参加大会的好几千劳动人民于是高呼反法西斯口号，列队向共和国广场前进。警察用武力来对付示威者，彼此发生了冲突。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局昨天晚上发表声明，指责政府一方面说要保卫共和国法治，另一方面却不敢打击最凶恶的敌人，反而禁止工人阶级和人民力量举行反法西斯示威。共产党警告政府不要同那些在阿尔及利亚制造暴乱的极右翼分子妥协。它要求：立即采取措施来镇压叛乱者；撤销马絮和其他叛乱领导人的职务，宣布他们的行动非法；逮捕在巴黎的所有阴谋犯，特别是主谋者雅克、苏斯戴尔，并将他们送交法院；解散法西斯集团和半军事集团；整肃军警干部；尊重民主自由，特别是劳动人民和一切保卫共和国的人的集会和游行的自由。
    政治局的声明说，在保卫自由的事业中，法国工人阶级和全体捍卫共和国制度的人应当依靠自己的力量，提高警惕，采取一致行动。
    法国总工会总书记弗拉商号召法国全体工人阶级采取联合行动，以便制止法西斯主义得逞。人权联盟、全国教师工会和全国教育联合会联合发表声明，揭露了法西斯分子的阴谋，并且号召一切拥护共和制度的人提高警惕。
    由于局势严重，一群政界人士已经成立了一个“警惕委员会”。加入这个委员会的有弗朗索瓦·密特朗（民主社会抵抗联盟），埃加·富尔（左翼共和联盟），爱德华·达拉第（邀进社会党）和樊尚·巴迪（邀进社会党）等人。密特朗昨天还在国民议会发言，要求政府解散在阿尔及利亚的“救国委员会”。
