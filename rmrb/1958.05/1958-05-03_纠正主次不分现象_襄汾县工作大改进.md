    Correcting the Phenomenon of Confusing Priorities
    Major Improvements in Xiangfen County's Work

    (Our Dispatch) The problem of Xiangfen County, Shanxi Province, where various tasks once confused priorities, affecting spring planting, has been resolved after being exposed in the newspaper (People's Daily, front page, April 6) and through the unified deployment and specific inspection and promotion by the Xiangfen County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.

    After correcting the method of working without a central focus, many township and commune leading cadres in Xiangfen County felt at a loss because they lacked experience in managing both central and non-central tasks, resulting in situations where they attended to one thing and neglected another. To help grassroots cadres solve practical difficulties in their work, the County Party Committee organized two groups of inspection teams, totaling 134 people, to go to the countryside. Following the principle of centering on production and conducting other work around production, the inspection teams assisted various townships and communes in grasping the key to production, making labor plans, and rationally arranging working hours. Over 1,000 problems were discovered during the inspection, and 85% of them have been resolved. Currently, production work in various townships and communes is flourishing, and other tasks such as water conservancy construction, seed selection and improvement, repair of agricultural implements, tree planting and afforestation, eliminating the four pests, and wiping out illiteracy have also made significant progress.

    纠正主次不分现象
    襄汾县工作大改进
    本报讯　山西省襄汾县一度发生的各项工作主次不分影响春耕播种的问题，经报纸（人民日报4月6日头版）揭示，中共襄汾县委统一部署和具体检查推动后，已经得到解决。
    襄汾县许多乡、社领导干部在纠正了漫无中心的工作方法以后，由于缺乏统一领导中心和非中心工作的经验，感到手足无措，发生了顾此失彼的现象。为了帮助基层干部解决实际工作中的困难，县委曾经组织了两批共一百三十四人的检查团下乡。检查团按着以生产为中心，其它工作围绕生产进行的原则，帮助各乡、社抓生产关键，作劳动规划，合理安排工作时间。检查中发现的一千多个问题，85％得到了解决。目前各乡、社生产工作已经蓬勃开展，其它水利建设、粒选优种、修理农具、植树造林和除四害、扫除文盲等工作，也有了显著发展。　　（冯建伟、杨义）
