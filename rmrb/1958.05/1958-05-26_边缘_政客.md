Notes

    “Edge” Politician
    The famous American commentator Walter Lippmann recently complained in the "Washington Post" that Dulles monopolized American diplomacy. He wrote: "Problems have arisen everywhere in Indonesia, Lebanon, Algeria and France, and in Latin America. These problems all carry challenges to the existing position and policies of the United States. And in these problems, the responsibility for deciding what to do next is concentrated on Dulles alone."
    People know that Dulles once made the American public frightened with his "brink of war" policy. Now, faced with many "challenges to the existing position and policies of the United States" in the world, where will this politician of the Wall Street tycoons take American foreign policy? In the words of former U.S. President Truman, it is "the edge of one of the greatest diplomatic disasters in American history." Lippmann also had to doubt "whether the implementation of our (American) foreign policy has been concentrated to a dangerous degree." It seems that their unease reflects a fact they both recognize—"edge" politicians have brought and will bring disaster to the United States.

    “边缘”政客
    美国著名评论家李普曼最近在“华盛顿邮报”上抱怨杜勒斯包揽美国外交。他写道：“在印度尼西亚、在黎巴嫩、在阿尔及利亚和法国以及在拉丁美洲处处都出了问题。在这些问题中都带有对美国现有地位和政策的挑战。而在这些问题里面，决定下一步该怎样办的责任则集中在杜勒斯一个人身上”。
    人们知道，杜勒斯曾以他的“战争边缘”政策使美国公众担惊受怕。现在，面临着世界上多处“对美国现有地位和政策的挑战”，这位华尔街巨富们的政客又要把美国的外交政策带到哪里去呢？用美国前总统杜鲁门的话来说就是“美国历史上最大的外交灾难之一的边缘”。李普曼也不得不怀疑“我国（美国）外交政策的执行是否已集中到了一个危险的程度了”。看来，他们的不安反映了一个他们共同认识到的事实——“边缘”政客已为美国并且将要为美国带来灾祸。
