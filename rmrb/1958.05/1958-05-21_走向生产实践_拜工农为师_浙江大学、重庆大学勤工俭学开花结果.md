Going into Production Practice: Learning from Workers and Peasants
Zhejiang University and Chongqing University's Work-Study Programs Bear Fruit

    (Our newspaper's reporter Huang Keping reports) During the "Double-Anti" movement, faculty and students at Zhejiang University launched a work-study program. The students are determined to cultivate themselves into new-style, working-class intellectuals who are both "red and expert."

    Based on the original metal cutting laboratory, foundry laboratory, practice factory, and mechanical instrument repair factory of the Department of Mechanical Engineering, the school established a mechanical manufacturing factory. Since its official establishment in early March, more than 2,100 students have participated in factory production each week. The production jobs include seven types of work: lathe work, fitter work, casting work, planer work, milling work, forging work, and pattern making. From March 4th to the present, this factory has produced tens of thousands of standard parts and gas engine parts. The six-foot lathe and 2.8-kilowatt motor to be produced have already been successfully trial-produced on "May Day."

    Currently, this factory has linked up with many departments. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has accepted a large number of standard parts and gas engine parts production tasks from four units, including Hangzhou Machine Tool Factory, and has accepted the manufacture of six-foot lathes, vertical drilling machines, optical component scales, six-hundred-power microscopes, and hardness testers. It also cooperates with Hangzhou Universal Machinery Factory to manufacture complete sets of equipment for a 2,000-ton synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant, with a total annual output value of more than 7 million yuan. Other departments, such as Electrical Engineering and Chemical Engineering, are cooperating with the Department of Mechanical Engineering or off-campus units to manufacture products such as motors, ammeters, rectifiers, and electrical equipment.

    Many teachers, through contact with actual production, have played a significant role in overcoming the detachment of theory from practice. Many teachers feel that in the past they could talk a lot in theory, but when they tried to directly apply the knowledge from books to production, they often "hit a wall." Mr. Wu Jing, director of the foundry workshop, said that many teachers in the foundry teaching and research group could talk very well about molding methods, but none of them knew how to operate in practice. Books say that to make the finished products in the foundry workshop smooth and non-sticky, coal powder should be added to the molding sand. After participating in practical labor this time, they found that adding coal powder was not as simple as copying from the book in class. If too much coal powder was added, it would cause excessive gas generation, and the molten iron could not be added; if too much coal powder was added, the temperature would be too high after adding the molten iron, causing it to burn; but sometimes if too little coal powder was added, the finished product would be sticky. They had produced many defective products just because of the coal powder addition problem.

    In the work-study program, many students learned some production techniques under the guidance of master workers and successfully completed their tasks. Their labor concepts and feelings have also changed. Every student, in contact with the master workers, was deeply moved by the consciousness and meticulous quality of work demonstrated by the working class in their labor.

    (Xinhua News Agency report) Faculty and students at Chongqing University, through work-study programs, have built three hydropower and biogas power stations together with workers and peasants, and have refined more than ten kinds of new alloy steels. The school's practice factory has also successfully trial-produced a batch of new products. The faculty and students have also gained a great deal ideologically.

    Teachers and students who directly led and participated in the work-study activities recently held separate discussions on their experiences. Wu Yunpeng, a young teaching assistant who designed the hydropower station for the Hongqi Agricultural Cooperative in the suburbs, said that when he first accepted the task of designing the power station, he still designed it as he had in the past, closed up at home. But after thinking about it for a long time, he couldn't start writing. First of all, there was no hydrological data, and he didn't understand the characteristics of the river. He didn't know how large a hydropower station should be designed. Later, he walked out of the office and learned about the river flow data from the peasants. In the process of design and construction, Wu Yunpeng initially designed a trapezoidal ditch according to the methods described in the books, but the amount of earthwork and stonework to be excavated was very large. The workers and peasants suggested that he change the trapezoidal ditch to a rectangular ditch, which was both easier and saved man-hours. Before the crucible furnace in the Department of Metallurgy was rebuilt, it took twenty-eight hours to smelt the first furnace of alloy steel, and the iron didn't even melt. Huang Xihu, the lecturer who designed the crucible furnace, found out after the fact that the furnace was not built reasonably. He took his redesigned drawings for rebuilding the crucible furnace and went to the steel factory with teaching assistant Song Qinian to consult the steel workers, and revised his drawings according to their opinions. The crucible furnace modified according to this drawing finally refined alloy steel. When the Department of Electrical Engineering began to trial-produce generators, some teachers emphasized the complexity of the technology and the difficulty of materials, and believed that it could not be trial-produced. However, after lecturer Zhao Xiaorong and others went to Chongqing Electrical Equipment Factory to humbly learn technology and operation from the workers, with the specific help of the workers in the factory, they finally succeeded in making a 20-kilowatt generator. They felt that they had learned a lot from the workers and peasants.

### 走向生产实践　拜工农为师  浙江大学、重庆大学勤工俭学开花结果

    走向生产实践　拜工农为师
    浙江大学、重庆大学勤工俭学开花结果
    本报讯　记者黄客萍报道：双反运动中，浙江大学师生开展了勤工俭学活动。学生们决心把自己培养成又红又专的新型的工人阶级知识分子。
    这个学校以原有机械系金属切削实验室、铸工实验室、实习工厂和机械仪器修造厂为基础，成立了机械制造厂，从3月初正式建立到目前为止，每周参加工厂生产的学生有二千一百多人。生产的工种有车工、钳工、铸工、刨工、铣工、锻工、模型工等七种。从3月4日到现在，这个工厂已经生产标准件和煤汽机零件数万件，准备生产的六尺车床和二点八瓩电动机，已在“五一”节正式试制成功。
    目前，这个工厂已与很多部门挂上了钩。机械系接受了杭州机床厂等四个单位的大批标准件和煤汽机零件的生产任务，并接受制造六尺车床、立式钻床、光学部件刻度、六百倍显微镜和硬度计等项，还和杭州通用机器厂等协作，制造二千吨合成氨化肥厂成套设备，合计年产值七百余万元。其他如电机、化工等系都分别和机械系或校外单位协作，制造电动机、火表、整流器、电器设备等产品。
    很多教师通过和实际生产的接触，对克服理论脱离实际起了很大作用。很多教师感到过去在理论上能讲一大套，但是一等到把书本上的知识直接搬用到生产中去时，就往往会“碰钉子”。担任铸工车间主任的吴京先生说，铸工教研组的许多教师，对造型方法都讲得很好，但对实际操作却一个也不会。书上说要使铸工车间的成品做得光滑、不粘砂，就要在型砂中加煤粉。这次他们亲身参加劳动实践以后，发现加煤粉并不像上课时照搬书本那么简单。煤粉加多了，造成发气量过多，铁水加不进去；加的煤粉过多，加进铁水后，温度过高，以致烧了起来；可是有时煤粉加少了，成品就粘砂。他们光是由于加添煤粉问题就出过不少废品。
    勤工俭学中，许多学生在老师傅的指导下，学会了一些生产技术，出色地完成了任务。他们的劳动观念和思想感情也起了变化。每个同学在和老师傅们接触时，深深地为工人阶级在劳动中所表现的自觉性和对工作一丝不苟的优秀品质而感动。
    新华社讯　重庆大学师生开展勤工俭学，同工人农民一起建成了三座水力和沼气发电站，炼成了十多种新的合金钢，学校的实习工厂还试制成功一批新产品，师生们在思想上也获得很大收获。
    直接领导和参加勤工俭学活动的教师与学生，最近分别座谈了他们的心得。为市郊红旗农业社设计水电站的青年助教吴云鹏说，他开始接受设计电站任务的时候，仍然像过去关在家里设计。可是考虑了很久，动不了笔。首先是没有水文资料，不懂河流的性格，应该设计多大的水电站不知道。后来他走出办公室，从农民那里了解到河水流量的资料。在设计与施工过程中，吴云鹏开始按照书本上讲的方法，设计了一条梯形的水沟，可是需要开挖的土石方工程很大。工人和农民建议他把梯形水沟改成矩形水沟后，又省事，又省工时。冶金系的坩锅炉在改建以前炼第一炉合金钢时，炼了二十八个小时，连铁都没有熔化。设计这座坩锅炉的讲师黄希祜，事后检查时才发现是炉子修建得不合理。他就把自己重新设计改建坩锅炉的图纸，和助教宋启年一起深入到钢铁厂去请教炼钢工人，并且根据他们的意见修改了自己的图纸。根据这个图纸修改的坩锅炉终于炼出了合金钢。电机系开始试制发电机时，部分教师强调技术复杂和材料困难，认为不能试制。但是讲师赵孝荣等专门到重庆电工器材厂虚心向工人学习技术和操作以后，在这个厂工人的具体帮助下，终于实现制成二十瓩发电机成功。他们感到从工人农民那里学到了许多东西。
