Striving to Maintain the Highest Cotton Yield Record
Cixi County Cotton Farmers Exert Themselves and Work Hard
(Our Dispatch) The cotton farmers of Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, which achieved the nation's highest cotton yield of 105 jin of ginned cotton per mu in 1957, are actively working to achieve this year's planned target of 150 to 200 jin of ginned cotton per mu and maintain the honor of being the nation's highest cotton yield county.

Transforming low-yield cotton fields is a prominent action for comprehensively increasing production this year. The coastal area of this county has approximately 200,000 mu of alluvial land, where the salinity is not suitable for cotton growth (freshwater land has few bolls), and the annual yield per mu is low, between 50 jin and 90 jin, which is far behind the 120 jin to over 200 jin per mu yield of other cotton fields in the county. Therefore, this year, soil improvement work was carried out to change saline land to freshwater land and freshwater land to saline land, and 80% of the transformation has been completed. In the western part of the county, the work of changing narrow ridges to wide ridges has also been promoted, which can increase 1,000 cotton plants per mu, totaling the equivalent of expanding 30,000 mu of cotton fields. The technical innovation movement, centered on promoting seedling cultivation in nutrient pots, has achieved remarkable results. In the past, Cixi County did not use nutrient pots for seedling cultivation. This year, the Cixi County Committee of the Communist Party of China sent people to Macheng County, Hubei Province, to visit, and after research and analysis, decided to learn and adopt this advanced cultivation technique. At present, the cotton sowing work has basically ended, and 80% of the more than 480,000 mu of cotton fields are using nutrient pots for seedling cultivation, and the sowing season has been advanced by 20 days to a month compared to previous years.

    力争保持棉花最高产量纪录
    慈溪县棉农鼓劲苦干
    本报讯　1957年获得亩产皮棉一百零五斤的全国棉花最高产量县的浙江省慈溪县的棉农，正为实现今年计划指标亩产皮棉一百五十斤到二百斤，保持全国棉花最高产量县的荣誉而积极劳动。
    改造低产棉地是今年全面增产的一个突出行动。这个县的沿海地区有约二十万亩冲积土地，咸淡程度不适宜棉花生长（淡性地结铃少），每年每亩产量较低，在五十斤与九十斤之间，与这个县的其它棉地亩产一百二十斤到二百斤以上相差甚远。因此，今年进行了咸改淡、淡改咸的改良土壤工作，到现在已有80％完成了改革。在这个县的西部地区，还推行了狭畦改宽畦的工作，每亩可以增加一千株棉花，总计起来等于扩大了三万亩棉田。以推行营养钵育苗为中心的技术革新运动已经出色地获得成绩。过去慈溪县是不用营养钵育苗的，今年中共慈溪县委派人到湖北省麻城县参观以后，经过研究分析，决定学习和采用这一先进栽培技术。现在，棉地播种工作已基本结束，四十八万多亩棉地有80％采用营养钵育苗，播种季节比往年提早了二十天到一个月。
