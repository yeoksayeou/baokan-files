Ma Lianchen was sent to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative No. 1 in Taikang County in January. In less than half a year since he arrived at the agricultural cooperative, he and the farmers have created two new tools, one of which is an automatic mud-sliding bucket. The automatic mud-sliding bucket uses two bamboo poles to build a cross-shaped frame in the bottom of the pond that is higher than the pond bank. A thick iron wire is stretched from the top of the frame to the pond bank as a cableway. The mud bucket is raised by a pulley on top of the bamboo pole, and when it is hung on the iron wire, it slides to the shore. The empty bucket can be sent back by another iron wire at the bottom of the pond.

In April, he and Ma Xuedian, the production team leader and a Communist Party member in the cooperative, jointly studied and, based on the principle of conveyor belts in factories, created a land-leveling soil transport belt using wood and bamboo strips. In the creation of these two tools, he encountered some difficult problems that he could not solve on his own. For example, when making the mud-sliding bucket, the wooden hook was always unable to hook accurately, and the cooperative members working together could not find a solution. He went to a village overnight to consult a skilled carpenter, and after receiving guidance, he rushed back to the construction site with a flashlight to experiment until the problem was solved before he rested. In this way, he relied on the experience and wisdom of various talents in the countryside to solve the difficulties caused by his own lack of experience and knowledge. (Shao Yongli)

    马连臣依靠集体智慧  创造两种工具
    马连臣1月下放到太康县的光明农业社一社。他到农业社不到半年就和农民一起创造了两种新工具，自动滑泥兜就是其中的一个。自动滑泥兜是用两根竹竿在塘底搭起一个比塘岸更高的交叉架子，一根粗铁丝从架顶纤到塘岸作为索道。泥兜由竹竿顶上的滑轮提高，挂上铁丝就滑到岸上。空兜可以由塘底的另一条铁丝送回。
    4月间，他又和社里的生产队长、共产党员马学典共同研究，根据工厂中传送带的原理，利用木料和竹片造了个平地运土带。他在创造这两个工具中，都曾遇到一些自己无法解决的困难问题。如在制造滑泥兜时，木挂勾总是挂不准，一起劳动的社员们也找不出解决方法，他就连夜到外村去请教高明的木匠，得到指点后，连夜打着手电筒赶回工地试验，直到解决了才去休息。他就这样依靠农村中各种人才的经验、智慧，解决了自己经验、知识不足的困难。　（邵永力）
