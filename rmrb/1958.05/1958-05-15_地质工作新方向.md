　　New Directions in Geological Work
　　To set up a small copper smelting plant, you need a copper mine; to set up a small iron smelting plant, you need an iron mine. In short, if every county is to set up industries, then every county must be able to find the necessary resources locally. If this cannot be done, then even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice.

    The Sichuan Geological Bureau discovered this new contradiction. Therefore, according to the general policy of developing both central and local industries simultaneously, they immediately changed their working policy. While continuing to search for mineral resources for central industries, they relied on the broad masses to carry out general surveys and provide local industries with a large number of diverse mineral resources.

    Expanding the service scope of geological work and closely integrating geological work with local industries will not only promote the leap forward in local industries but also promote the leap forward in geological work. The practice of the Sichuan Geological Bureau is worthy of promotion.

　　地质工作新方向
　　办个小炼铜厂，要有铜矿，办个小炼铁厂，要有铁矿，总之，县县都办工业，就必须县县都能就地找到必需的资源。做不到这一点，巧媳妇就难为无米之炊。
    四川地质局发现了这个新的矛盾，于是，他们根据中央工业同地方工业同时并举的总方针，立即改变自己的工作方针，在继续为中央工业寻找矿产资源的同时，依靠广大群众，开展普查，给地方工业提供大量的多样的矿产资源。
    扩大地质工作的服务对象，把地质工作和地方工业紧密结合起来，这样，既促进了地方工业的跃进，也促进了地质工作的跃进。四川地质局的作法是值得提倡的。
