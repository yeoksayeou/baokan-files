Socialism's "Courtesy"
　　Chang Feng

    As the saying goes, "Too much courtesy is never a fault." However, I recently heard of instances where excessive courtesy was met with criticism.

    Under the slogan of "Learn from Tianqiao, Catch up with Tianqiao," commercial workers across the country have been improving their business management and service attitudes. Salespersons in cooperatives and department stores are all receiving every customer with great enthusiasm and sincerity. When you arrive, they nod and greet you, asking what you'd like to buy; when you leave, they say goodbye. If you are selecting items, they will fetch another if you don't like this one, never tiring of fetching or answering questions. How can this attitude not warm people's hearts? I have personally experienced this several times: although I didn't buy anything after visiting several stores in a row, the smiling faces made me feel truly rewarded. I have thought several times of the civilized transactions in the Gentleman's Country in "Flowers in the Mirror." This is no longer a fantasy in the writings of scholars in the old society; it has become a living reality today in our country.

    New things are always subject to discussion. I have heard the following view: it is of course good that the salespersons are making progress in their work, but why so many cumbersome courtesies? It really makes people feel unaccustomed and rather awkward, and so on.

    Unaccustomed, perhaps, some may be. The hypocritical etiquette of the old society, such as clasping hands and saying "Today's weather, ha ha ha..." has long been abandoned and forgotten; the shop assistants who used to be employed by capitalists and had to bow and scrape to customers for the sake of their jobs have straightened their backs. How many people cheered for this change! This cheering was not because everyone was spared many cumbersome courtesies, but because behind it, the evil habits of a cold and calculating society were destroyed, and human feelings became more genuine. Isn't that so? In the old society, market transactions were also the most ruthless: except for money, money, money, it was still money, money, money. Shop assistants bowed and scraped to people in order to make money for the capitalists; making money for the capitalists was so that they could keep their jobs and barely make a living. The capitalists were insatiably greedy for money, and they did not hesitate to sell fake goods or inferior goods to pass off as good ones. At that time, one had to be careful everywhere to avoid being cheated!

    The new society has helped people to free themselves from this kind of aversion. Get rid of suspicion and be frank with each other. In this new relationship, commercial work has truly achieved fair scales, full measures, and sufficient yardage, and "honesty to the old and young." Now, an even newer relationship between people is vividly presented before people's eyes: the salesperson who you don't know takes care of you as if you were a relative or friend. This phenomenon seems familiar to us, but also a bit strange. What is habit? It is something you are used to and take for granted.

    However, if we don't deliberately try to understand why the salespersons are so courteous, or equate this phenomenon with what we saw in the old society, then even if we see it every day and everywhere, we will always feel out of place.

    It is precisely because in this surging tide of the national Great Leap Forward, salespersons are all competing in their efforts and striving to be advanced. They understand that to better serve the people, it is specifically embodied in every moment of contact with customers. They also understand the principle of "I for everyone, everyone for me." This "everyone" is you, is me, is our relatives, is our comrades whether we know them or not... Don't you see: some medical workers were moved by the service attitude of the salespersons, and they resolved to learn from the spirit of salespersons who care for and consider customers, and to better take care of patients; some soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were moved by the service attitude of the salespersons, and they vowed to serve the people wholeheartedly like the salespersons, and defend the motherland.

    Unaccustomed will eventually become habit, if we have completely melted into this "everyone." At that time, it will not only be that too much courtesy is never a fault, but we will certainly feel that the more "courtesy" there is, the more intimate it becomes. Because this "courtesy" is the "courtesy" of socialism. The more of this kind of "courtesy" there is, the more it can make people love socialism and build socialism with unwavering determination.

### 社会主义的“礼”

　　社会主义的“礼”
　　长风
    俗话说：“礼多人不怪”。可是，最近我却听说有礼多而受人责怪的事。
    全国的商业工作者在“学天桥、赶天桥”的口号下，纷纷改进了经营管理，改善了服务态度。合作社、百货商店的营业员们，个个满腔热情、殷勤恳切地接待着每一个顾客。来了，向你点头招呼，问你买点什么；走了，又说声再见。如果你挑选东西，这个不中意又给你取那个，百拿不厌、百问不烦。这态度，怎叫人不感到心里热呼呼的。我就有过那么几次亲身感受：虽然我一连走了几家商店都没有买什么东西，但那一张张笑容可掬的面孔，使我确实感到满载而归。我几次想到“镜花缘”中君子国里的文明交易，不再是旧社会里文人笔下的幻境，在今天、在我们的国家里，已经变成了活生生的现实。
    新的事物，总有人要议论。我就听到这样一种说法：营业员们工作跃进当然很好，但何须那么多繁琐的礼节？实在让人感到不习惯，怪别扭，云云。
    不习惯，也许是会有些的。旧社会里那种逢人拱手、“今天天气哈哈哈……”的虚伪客套早已被人们摒弃和淡忘了；从前被资本家雇用、为了饭碗而不得不向顾客们点头哈腰的店员们，腰板挺直起来了。多少人为这种改变欢呼过啊！这欢呼，不是因为大家省却了许多繁琐的礼节，而是在那背后，摧毁了世态炎凉，尔虞我诈的恶习，人情也益见得真。不是吗？在旧社会，市场交易也是最冷酷无情的：除了钱、钱、钱，还是钱、钱、钱。店员向人卑躬屈膝，是为了替资本家赚钱；替资本家赚钱，是为了自己能保持聊以糊口的饭碗。资本家对钱贪得无餍，卖的货色也就不惜以假充真、以次顶好。那时候，处处都要谨防上当！
    新社会帮助人们从这种厌恶之中解脱了出来。除去猜疑，开诚相见。在这新的关系中，商业工作也真正作到了秤平、斗满、尺码足，和“童叟无欺”。到现在，更为崭新的人与人的关系焕然呈现在人们的眼前：那素不相识的营业员也如同接待亲友一般地对你照顾备至。这种现象，对我们说来，似曾相识，可又有点陌生。什么叫习惯？就是惯见了而又习以为常。
    然而，如果我们不刻意去了解那营业员为何如此多礼，或把这现象与旧社会中所见等量齐观的话，那么，即使天天见，到处见，始终还是要感到格格不入的。
    正是由于营业员们在这万马奔腾、全民大跃进中，个个比干劲，人人比先进。他们懂得要更好地为人民服务，就具体体现在每时每刻同顾客的接触中。他们更懂得“我为人人、人人为我”的道理。这“人人”，是你，是我，是我们的亲属，是我们相识的或未曾相识的同志……你不见：有的医务工作者被售货员的服务态度感动了，他们立志要学习营业员那种关心、体贴顾客的精神，更好地照顾病人；有的解放军被售货员的服务态度感动了，他们发誓要像营业员一样地全心全意为人民服务，捍卫祖国。
    不习惯终究会变成习惯的，如果我们已完全融化在这“人人”之中的时候。那时节，不仅止于礼多人不怪，而且一定会感到“礼”愈多愈亲切。因为这“礼”，是社会主义之“礼”，这种“礼”愈多，愈能使人热爱社会主义，并且一往直前地建设社会主义。
