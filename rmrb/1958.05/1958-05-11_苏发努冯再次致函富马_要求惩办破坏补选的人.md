Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 10th: Vientiane Dispatch: Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the Lao Patriotic Party, wrote a second letter to Lao Kingdom Prime Minister Prince Phouma on April 27th, again demanding an end to all discrimination and retaliation against former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, Patriotic Party members, and its supporters.

　　This letter has been copied to the Speaker of the Lao National Assembly and the Chairman of the International Commission for Laos.

　　The letter lists new facts, pointing out that those who sabotaged the supplementary elections to the Lao National Assembly are intensifying their arrests and killings of former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, Patriotic Party members, and its supporters. Souphanouvong said in the letter that these facts confirm the previously revealed matters and clearly demonstrate that certain ministers of the Kingdom Government and certain military and political authorities are discriminating against and carrying out organized retaliation against former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, Patriotic Party members, and its supporters in all provinces of the Kingdom.

　　The letter cites examples that two ministers of the Lao Kingdom government threatened local administrative personnel with dismissal and arrest to control the election and threatened voters to vote for the National Party candidates instead of Souphanouvong and others.

　　The letter also cites an example that the independent candidate, Ouane Sananikone, said on April 18th in Ban Hin village: If I am elected and gain power, I will behead those former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel and display their heads to the public. If I cannot be elected, I will lead my three thousand troops to fight. He said: There will be airplanes to supply me.

　　A National Party candidate named Kham Sing said that if the National Party's campaign cannot succeed, I will lead five thousand people to fight. He said: The United States will airdrop food and weapons to me.

　　Souphanouvong pointed out that, in addition to this, leaflets slandering the former Pathet Lao fighting forces and the Patriotic Party were distributed by planes and jeeps. They also specially set up a radio station to carry out propaganda slandering the Patriotic Party.

　　In this letter, Souphanouvong also cited eighty-two new instances of former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, Patriotic Party members, and its supporters being arrested, tortured, and killed.

　　Souphanouvong emphasized that: The above-mentioned actions clearly violate the agreement on unification and integration signed by the Kingdom Government and the former Pathet Lao fighting forces. He pointed out that these actions are intended to undermine the spirit of reconciliation and coordination, which is necessary for national construction and the consolidation of political and economic independence.

　　Souphanouvong finally requested the Kingdom Government, the National Assembly, and the International Commission for Laos to take immediate measures to release the arbitrarily arrested former Pathet Lao fighting forces personnel, Patriotic Party members, and its supporters, to punish the murderers, to prohibit all discriminatory actions; and to take effective measures to ensure that the supplementary elections can be conducted in a fair, peaceful, and free environment.

　　苏发努冯再次致函富马  要求惩办破坏补选的人
    新华社河内10日电　万象消息：老挝爱国党领袖苏发努冯亲王
  4月27日第二次写信给老挝王国首相富马亲王，再次要求停止对前寮国战斗部队人员、爱国党党员和它的支持者的一切歧视和报复行动。
    这封信已经抄送老挝国民议会议长和老挝国际委员会主席。
    信中列举新的事实，指出对老挝国民议会补充选举进行破坏的分子在变本加厉地继续逮捕和杀害前寮国战斗部队人员、爱国党党员和它的支持者。苏发努冯在信中说，这些事实证实了以前所揭露的事情，并且清楚地证实了王国政府的某些大臣和某些军政当局在王国的所有省份中对前寮国战斗部队人员、爱国党党员和它的支持者加以歧视和进行有组织的报复。
    信中举例指出，老挝王国政府的两位大臣曾经以撤职和逮捕来威胁地方行政人员控制选举，并且威胁选民投国家党候选人而不投苏发努冯等人的票。
    信中还举例说，独立党候选人温·萨纳尼空4月18日在班津地方说：如果我当选和掌握政权的话，我就要把那些前寮国战斗部队的人员枭首示众。如果我不能当选的话，我将率领我的三千部下去打仗。他说：将会有飞机给我接济。
    一个名叫坎星的国家党候选人说，如果国家党竞选不能取胜，我就要率领五千人去打仗。他说：美国会给我空投粮食和武器。
    苏发努冯指出，除此之外，还有人用飞机和吉普车散发诬蔑前寮国战斗部队和爱国党的传单。他们还专设一个广播电台来进行诬蔑爱国党的宣传。
    苏发努冯在这封信中还举出了八十二个前寮国战斗部队人员、爱国党员和它的支持者被逮捕、拷打和杀害的新的事例。
    苏发努冯强调说：上述行动明显地违反了王国政府和前寮国战斗部队签订的关于统一和合并的协议。他指出，这些行动是为了破坏和解和协调的精神，而这种精神对于国家的建设和政治、经济独立的巩固是必要的。
    苏发努冯最后要求王国政府、国民议会和老挝国际委员会立即采取措施，释放被任意逮捕的前寮国战斗部队人员、爱国党党员和它的支持者，惩办凶犯，禁止一切歧视的行动；并且采取有效的措施来保证补充选举能够在公正、平静和自由的情况下进行。
