Heilongjiang Discovers Valuable Mink

    (Our report) In February of this year, hunters in Fuyuan County, Heilongjiang, captured a valuable, soft-furred animal, a mink (Mustela vison), not previously known to be produced in our country.

    The mink's body shape is similar to the yellow weasel (Mustela altaica) produced in Heilongjiang Province, but its fur is brownish. Minks belong to the Mustelidae family and are amphibious animals. They live near rivers and are good at diving underwater to catch frogs, fish, mice, and other small animals for food. This soft-furred animal has dense, glossy fur with a velvety texture, making it highly valuable. The geographical environment and climate of Heilongjiang Province are well-suited to the mink's living habits, which could allow it to establish a permanent population. (Du Jinglong, Liu Yinghua)

    黑龙江发现珍贵的水貂
    本报讯　今年2月间黑龙江抚远县的猎人，捕获了一只我国从不出产的珍贵软毛小动物——水貂（明克）。
    水貂体形和黑龙江省出产的黄鼬（元皮）相似，但毛色发褐、水貂属于鼬科，系水陆两栖动物。栖息于河流地带附近，善于潜入水底捕蛙、鱼、鼠等小动物为食。这种软毛小动物，毛绒稠密、有光泽呈丝绒状，价值珍贵，黑龙江省的地理环境以及气候等条件，很适合水貂的生活习性，可以使它定居下来。　　（杜景龙、刘英华）
