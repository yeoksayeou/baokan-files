Hubei Province's Experience Proves that Major Inspections are a Good Way to Promote Progress
From the province to the townships, leaders at all levels combine together, looking, talking, inspecting, and arranging; discovering shortcomings, correcting them in time, and quickly promoting good experiences.

(Our newspaper's dispatch) The first province-wide agricultural inspection organized by the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has concluded successfully.

This was an unprecedented large-scale agricultural production inspection. Six of the seven members of the Standing Committee participated in this major inspection, along with almost all members of the Provincial Party Committee, the directors and deputy directors of various departments and commissions, the directors and deputy directors of various bureaus, and the heads of various mass organizations. Local Party committees and county Party committees went all out. In addition, local Party committees also transferred nearly one hundred local Party committee members and county Party secretaries to inspect each other.

This major inspection started on March 10th, and the inspection teams traveled extensively. All seventy-one counties in the province were visited, even the large mountainous areas that provincial cadres had never been to before. Each county visited more than a dozen townships, and each township visited several cooperatives. Some were "glance-overs," while others were more in-depth, with each county, township, and cooperative having key areas of focus for inspection. The masses warmly welcomed the inspection teams. The people of Yingcheng County said: "The superiors are coming to inspect, so we must come up with some impressive production achievements." An old woman in Macheng County, upon hearing that the inspection team would be passing through her village, boiled a pot of water and waited for two hours, insisting that each person drink a bowl. In Xiaogan County, 150,000 people listened to the inspection team's broadcasts.

The inspection revealed that the general situation in rural Hubei is that the masses have ample drive, great diligence, good methods, and numerous innovations, with a vibrant atmosphere everywhere and all aspects of production showing leaps and bounds compared to last year. The inspection team affirmed these achievements and commended some of the areas with the greatest achievements and the most resolute changes in leadership style.

During the inspection process, it was discovered that some areas experienced unbalanced leaps forward and measures that failed to keep up with targets, or that while the measures were good, there were contradictions between them and subjective capabilities; in some areas, cadres' work styles had not changed enough, and they were not good at implementing the mass line in their work; some areas focused closely on the production of major crops but were more relaxed, or even neglectful, towards diversified operations; some areas showed signs of complacency in striving for a bumper harvest of summer crops; some areas were experiencing "simultaneous advancement" without prominently focusing on agricultural production as the center; some areas were not rigorously addressing the rectification movement against waste and conservatism; and some areas did not pay enough attention to the lives of the masses, or lacked appropriate measures in this regard. Many of these issues have already been resolved during the inspection process, and others are being resolved. For example, many areas, due to insufficient awareness of the significance of striving for increased production of summer crops, were planning to use some of the summer crops as green manure. After the inspection team raised their concerns, they all changed their original plans, avoiding unnecessary losses. According to statistics from Xiaogan Prefecture alone, it has been decided that over 800,000 mu of summer crops will not be used for green manure. At the same time, the inspection team promptly discovered and promoted many advanced experiences, such as the wheat field management experience of Gucheng County, the rectification experience of Fenghuang Township in Xinzhou County, the experience of Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County in combining technical night schools and experimental fields, and the experience of Hong'an and Macheng Counties in properly combining central tasks and departmental work.

The main content of this inspection was agricultural production and rural rectification. At the same time, the work of industrial, cultural, educational, financial, and food departments was also examined, and the issue of how various departments should coordinate and support the central task, revolving around agricultural production, was studied and resolved. Therefore, the major inspection not only directly promoted the leap forward in agricultural production but also promoted the development of work in other departments. It not only encouraged the masses but also educated the leaders. The inspection team was actually a visiting group, a study group, and a promotion group.

This major inspection was developed on the basis of small-scale visits and evaluations in previous years. The five levels of province, prefecture, county, district, and township were combined together, going deep into reality, looking, talking, inspecting, and arranging, with the work being carried out vividly, concretely, and freely. Facts have proven that this approach can not only rapidly promote good experiences but also promptly discover and correct subjectivism in work, making it easier to carry out criticism and self-criticism. The Provincial Party Committee believes that major inspections are a good method and has decided to establish this inspection method as a system; in addition to the inspection that has already concluded this year, three more major agricultural inspections will be organized.

    湖北省的经验证明
    大检查是促进的好办法
    从省到乡，各级领导者结合在一起，一面看，一面谈，一面检查，一面布置；发现缺点，及时纠正，看到好经验就很快推广。
    本报讯　由中共湖北省委组织的全省首次农业大检查已经胜利结束。
    这是一次空前的大规模的农业生产大检查。七位常委中有六位参加了这次大检查，省委委员、各部委的正副部长、各厅局的正副厅局长、各群众团体的负责人，几乎全部出动。各地委、县委更是全力以赴。此外，各地委还抽调了将近一百名地委委员和县委书记彼此互相检查。
    这次大检查是从3月10日开始的，检查团走得很广。全省七十一个县都走遍了，从来没有省里干部去过的大山区也走到了。每个县看了十几个乡，每个乡看了几个社。有的是“走马看花”，有的是“下马看花”，县、乡、社都有检查重点。群众热烈欢迎检查团。应城县的群众说：“上头要来检查了，一定要把生产搞出点板眼来才是。”麻城县的一位老太婆，听说检查团要从村里过，烧了一锅开水等了两个钟头，非让每人喝上一碗不可。孝感县有十五万人收听检查团的广播。
    检查情况说明，当前湖北农村中的总形势是：群众干劲足、钻劲大、办法好、创造多，处处气象万千，各项生产成绩都比去年有飞跃的提高。检查团肯定了这些成绩，并且表扬了一些成绩最大的、领导作风转变最坚决的地区。
    在检查过程中发现：有的地区跃进不平衡和措施跟不上指标的现象，或者是措施虽好，但和主观力量间存在着矛盾；有些地区干部作风转变得不够，不善于在工作中贯彻群众路线；有的地区对主要作物的生产抓得较紧，而对多种经营抓得较松，甚至有所忽视；有的地区在力争夏收作物大丰产方面有松劲情绪；有的地区存在着“齐头并进”的情况，没有突出地抓住农业生产这一中心；有的地区对反浪费、反保守的整风运动抓得不紧；还有的地区对群众生活关心不够，或者在这方面缺乏应有的措施等。其中不少问题已经在检查过程中解决了，还有些正在解决中。例如不少地区由于对力争夏收作物多增产的意义认识不足，因而准备把部分夏收作物沤作绿肥。经检查团提出意见后，都纷纷改变了原来的打算，避免了不应有的损失。仅据孝感专区的统计，已决定不沤的夏收作物，就有八十万亩之多。同时，检查团还及时地发现和推广了许多先进经验，如像谷城县小麦田间管理经验、新洲县凤凰乡整风经验、天门县小庙乡把技术夜校和试验田结合的经验以及红安、麻城县中心工作和部门工作妥善结合的经验等。
    这次检查的主要内容是农业生产和农村整风。同时对于工业、文教、财经、粮食等部门的工作，也都看了一下，围绕着农业生产，研究解决了各部门如何配合、支援中心工作的问题。因此大检查不仅直接推动了农业生产的跃进，也促进了其他部门工作的开展。不仅鼓舞了群众，也教育了领导者。检查团实际上又是参观团、学习团、促进团。
    这次大检查，是在往年的小型参观评比的基础上发展起来的。省、地、县、区、乡五级结合在一起，深入实际，一面看，一面谈，一面检查，一面布置，工作进行得生动具体，无拘无束。事实证明，这样做既可把好经验迅速推广，又可及时发现和纠正工作中的主观主义，批评和自我批评容易展开。省委认为，大检查是一个好方法，决定把这个检查方法作为一种制度；今年除已经结束的这次检查外，还要组织三次农业大检查。
