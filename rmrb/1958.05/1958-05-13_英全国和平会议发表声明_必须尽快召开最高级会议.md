Xinhua News Agency, London, May 11th: The British National Peace Conference, held here today, called for a top-level meeting to be held quickly, with preliminary agreements reached between countries first, followed by broader agreements.

    This conference was initiated by the British Peace Committee. The 170 representatives attending the conference included representatives from peace groups, trade unions, cooperatives, religious organizations, and the Communist and Labour parties from all over Britain, representing a total of 670,000 people.

    The conference unanimously passed a statement on the top-level meeting. The statement said: A top-level meeting must be held as soon as possible. Necessary preparations must not be used as a justification for continuing military measures, as these measures themselves will make agreements more difficult to reach. An immediate cessation of further nuclear weapons testing, a halt to the construction of missile bases, and the arming of West Germany with nuclear weapons are necessary in order to reach a final agreement to end these activities as soon as possible.

    The statement emphasized: Public opinion and the world movement demanding peace must shape governments' attitudes towards top-level talks. The talks should first discuss the unconditional cessation of nuclear testing and partial disengagement. If agreements are reached on these issues, it will pave the way for broader agreements in the future.

    During the discussion, many speakers emphasized the urgent need for nuclear disarmament. One representative, in discussing the economic costs of the Cold War and the economic consequences of disarmament, said that every Briton pays ten shillings and eleven pence per week for Britain's domestic military expenses alone.

    The reduction of armaments and the diversion of resources to peaceful purposes would not only raise the general consumption level of the British people by about 15 percent, but would also create a new economic situation with possibilities that are currently unimaginable.

    The conference also passed a resolution expressing support for the World Peace Congress to be held in Stockholm in July. The resolution said that Britain will send representatives to the congress to study with representatives from various countries on how to better cooperate to achieve world disarmament and peaceful cooperation among nations.

    英全国和平会议发表声明
　　必须尽快召开最高级会议
    新华社伦敦11日电　今天在这里举行的英国全国和平会议呼吁迅速举行最高级会议，首先达成各国的初步协议，随后再达成更广泛的协议。
    这次会议是由英国和平委员会发起的。参加会议的有拥有六十七万人的几百个各种团体的一百七十位代表，其中包括英国各地的和平团体、工会、合作社、宗教团体、共产党和工党的代表。
    会议一致通过关于最高级会议的声明。声明说：必须尽快地举行最高级会议，决不能使必要的准备工作成为继续采取军事措施的理由，因为这些措施本身就会使得协议更难以达成。立即停止进一步的核武器试验、停止建立导弹基地和用核武器武装西德军队，以便早日达成最后结束这些活动的协议。
    声明强调：要求和平的公众舆论、世界运动必须形成各国政府对最高级会谈的态度。会谈应该首先讨论无条件停止核试验和局部脱离接触的问题。如果就这些问题取得协议，这将为以后的更加广泛的协议铺平道路。
    在讨论期间，许多发言人都强调急需实行裁减核军备。一位代表在谈到冷战的经济消耗和裁军的经济后果时说，每一个英国人每周仅为英国的国内的武装费用就要付出十先令又十一便士。
    裁减军备而把资源转而用于和平目的，这不仅会把英国人民的消费水平普遍提高约15％，而且会产生具有目前所梦想不到的可能性的新经济局势。
    会议还通过决议，表示支持定于7月在斯德哥尔摩举行的世界和平大会。决议说，英国将派代表出席这次大会，同各国代表一起研究关于如何更好地合作来实现世界裁军和各国的和平合作的问题。
