Qinghai Refines Copper, Lead and Iron

Xining, May 5th (This newspaper) – On the morning of April 28th, the Qinghai Plateau used indigenous methods to smelt its first batch of copper, lead, and iron.

Qinghai has abundant reserves of copper, lead, and iron ore, almost throughout every prefecture and county. In order to enable the widespread use of indigenous methods for smelting copper, lead, etc., throughout the province, the Qinghai Provincial Department of Industry specially transferred a group of employees to first establish indigenous furnaces in Xining for trial smelting. They began building the indigenous brick furnaces on April 2nd, and by the 28th, they had built five or six, and had separately refined copper, lead, and iron.

These indigenous furnaces can produce more than 300 kilograms of copper and more than 600 kilograms of iron per day. As the workers become more skilled, production can be gradually increased.

    青海炼出了铜铅铁
    本报西宁5日电　4月28日早晨，青海高原用土法冶炼出第一炉铜、铅和铁。
    青海境内铜、铅和铁矿蕴藏丰富，几乎遍布每个州、县。为了使土法冶炼铜、铅等在全省遍地开花，青海省工业厅特别抽调了一部分职工首先在西宁建立土炉进行试炼。他们从4月2日开始用砖砌土炉，到28日就砌好了五、六个，并且分别炼出了铜、铅、铁。
    这种土炉子每天可以生产三百多公斤铜，六百多公斤铁。在职工的技术熟练以后，产量还可以逐步提高。
