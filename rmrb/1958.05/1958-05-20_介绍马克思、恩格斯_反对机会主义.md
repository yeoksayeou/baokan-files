　　Introducing Marx and Engels' "Against Opportunism"
　　Jiang Chunfang
　　The book "Against Opportunism" by Marx and Engels collects several important articles and letters by Marx and Engels exposing the essence of opportunism in the workers' movement. These articles and letters reflect the thorough and continuous struggle of the founders of Marxism against opportunism.
　　Revisionism is the expression of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology in the workers' movement and the socialist movement. At a time when resolutely struggling against modern revisionism, rereading the important principles of Marx and Engels against opportunism and dogmatism is of particular practical significance.
　　As everyone knows, Marxism grew and was consolidated in the struggle against various petty-bourgeois socialist trends of thought, against "true socialism," and against Proudhonism. The characteristics of "true socialism," Proudhonism, and other schools of petty-bourgeois socialism are a failure to understand the materialist principle of historical development, a failure to understand the world-historical role of the proletariat, a failure to understand the necessity of the proletariat carrying out revolutionary class struggle, and a failure to understand the necessity of establishing a militant party of the working class. In the collection, the introduction to Part II, "True Socialism," of Marx and Engels' "The German Ideology" and the article "Circular Against Kriege" expose the essence of the "true socialists," pointing out that they are thinkers of the German petty-bourgeois stratum, embodying some of the most undesirable characteristics of the petty-bourgeois stratum—political incompetence and cowardice. Marx and Engels severely criticized the "true socialists'" statements against revolutionary methods of struggle, criticized their attempts to obliterate sharp class contradictions and intra-party contradictions, and criticized their compromising attitude.
　　The founders of Marxism established a Communist Correspondence Committee in Brussels, and they insisted in this committee that such useless petty-bourgeois socialist elements must be purged from the communist movement. The second part of the collection contains two letters from Engels to the Brussels Communist Correspondence Committee in 1846, reflecting his struggle in Paris against "true socialists" and Proudhon and others.
　　Marx and Engels' criticism of the petty-bourgeois "true socialism" also hit modern revisionism, because modern revisionism denies the necessity of materialism's resolute struggle against idealism, distorts the essence of the soul of Marxism—materialist dialectics, and distorts the revolutionary theory of class struggle and its main ideas, namely, the irreconcilability of interests between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and the irreconcilability of the ideology of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie.
　　Marx and Engels' active struggle against non-proletarian ideas and against acts of betrayal deviating from the revolutionary road is an example for every Marxist. Marx and Engels carried out a relentless struggle against this petty-bourgeois trend of thought, liberating active activists of the German workers' movement and socialist movement from their influence, and in 1847 established the Communist League—the germ of the proletarian communist party.
　　The collection's "The Sonvillier Congress and the International," "On Authority," and several letters from Marx and Engels illustrate their struggle against Lassalleans, Proudhonists, Bakuninists, and other sectarian and petty-bourgeois factions within the International Workingmen's Association.
　　In several letters, Marx and Engels severely attacked the Lassalleans—opportunists in the German workers' movement in the 1860s and 1870s, attacking them for accommodating the reactionary classes that dominated Germany at the time, attacking them for abandoning revolutionary tactics and the struggle for democracy, and attacking them for abandoning the principles of proletarian internationalism and climbing onto the bourgeois nationalist position.
　　The collection also includes several articles and letters, the content of which is against Bakunin's followers, against anarchists who carried out divisive activities within the International. In the article "The Sonvillier Congress and the International" and several letters, Marx and Engels revealed that the basic principle of the anarchists' tactics was the complete autonomy of the International's national federations and branches, and the complete dispersion of the forces of the international workers' movement. In the struggle against the anarchists, the founders of Marxism consistently insisted on the most important party-building principle of the proletarian party, namely, the principle of democratic centralism. Engels mocked the anarchists' organizational principles—neither unified leadership, nor party discipline, nor the principle of the minority being subordinate to the majority. ("The Sonvillier Congress and the International") In the article "On Authority," in a letter to the anarchist Cerzaghi, and in other materials in the collection, Engels also pointed out that the anarchists' attacks on authority, on democratic centralism, and on dictatorship were absurd and reactionary.
　　In the early 1870s, the First International, led by Marx and Engels, completed its historical mission, assisting several countries in Western Europe in organizing proletarian socialist parties. Under these new conditions, the founders of Marxism attached great importance to theoretically ensuring that the socialist parties being formed could have revolutionary principles that could stand on their own feet. They tirelessly struggled to maintain the purity of communist theory. "Critique of the Gotha Program" vividly depicts their struggle against unprincipled compromise with the Lassalleans, against attempts to deviate from the principles of proletarian internationalism, and against distorting Marx's theory of the proletarian state and dictatorship. In this work, Marx put forward the classic definition of the transition period, pointed out that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the state form of this transition period, and ingeniously expressed the principle that communist society has two stages.
　　"Critique of the Gotha Program," "Letter to Bebel, W. Liebknecht, W. Bracke, et al. ("Circular Letter")", Engels' preface to the second edition of "The Housing Question," and many letters from Marx and Engels prove that Marx and Engels carried out a constant and fierce struggle against opportunism in the workers' movement. Marx and Engels pointed out more than once that in order to prevent the proletarian party from being corrupted by opportunism, it should regularly purge opportunistically corrupted elements from within itself.
　　Regarding the German Social Democratic movement, Marx and Engels emphasized that it was necessary to fight against the right wing of the workers' party and to carry out a ruthless battle against opportunism within the Social Democratic Party. And they fought with the same determination against the right wing in the French socialist movement and in the workers' movements of other countries.
　　Regarding the socialists in England and America, Marx and Engels also exposed their opportunism and criticized their dogmatism and sectarianism, as well as their style of being detached from the workers' movement and isolated. In a letter to Sorge, Engels emphasized that Marxism is not a dogma, but a guide to action.
　　Lenin always pointed out with admiration the thorough and continuous struggle that Marx and Engels carried out against opportunism (which, after their death, under new historical conditions, developed into revisionism). Lenin made outstanding contributions in defeating the revisionism of the Second International.
　　At present, the great development of the international communist movement has aroused great fear among the imperialist elements. In addition to mobilizing all forces to launch frantic attacks on socialist countries from the front, they also use certain opportunist elements in the revolutionary ranks to undermine the international communist movement from within. This is the objective reason for the rise of modern revisionist trends of thought.
　　The declaration of the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties pointed out that modern revisionism is an expression of an ideology incompatible with the proletariat and communism. The root of revisionism is the influence of the bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie, and the surrender to imperialist pressure. Therefore, resolutely fighting against modern revisionism is an extremely important task of the international communist movement at the present stage. The works and letters of Marx and Engels included in this collection can help us to study more deeply how the founders of Marxism carried out an irreconcilable struggle against opportunism, and can help us to more effectively fight against bourgeois ideology and modern revisionism.

　　介绍马克思、恩格斯“反对机会主义”
　　姜椿芳
    马克思、恩格斯“反对机会主义”一书收集了马克思、恩格斯揭露工人运动中机会主义实质的几篇重要文章和书信。这些文章和书信反映了马克思主义创始人对机会主义所进行的彻底的不断的斗争。
    修正主义是资产阶级和小资产阶级思想意识在工人运动和社会主义运动中的表现。在目前对现代修正主义进行坚决斗争的时候，重读马克思和恩格斯反对机会主义和教条主义的重要原理，特别具有现实意义。
    大家知道，马克思主义是在反对各色各样小资产阶级社会主义思潮、反对“真正社会主义”、反对蒲鲁东主义的斗争中成长和巩固起来的。“真正社会主义”、蒲鲁东主义以及小资产阶级社会主义其他各种流派的特征是不懂得历史发展的唯物主义的原则，不懂得无产阶级的世界历史作用，不懂得无产阶级进行革命阶级斗争的必要性，不懂得建立工人阶级战斗政党的必要性。文集里，马克思、恩格斯的“德意志思想体系”一书第二部分“真正的社会主义”的导言和“反克利盖的通告”一文，揭露了“真正社会主义者”的本质，指出他们是德国小市民阶层的思想者，他们体现了小市民阶层最要不得的一些特点——政治上的无能和懦怯。马克思和恩格斯严厉地批评了“真正社会主义者”反对革命斗争方法的言论，批判了他们抹杀尖锐的阶级矛盾和党内矛盾的企图，批判了他们妥协的态度。
    马克思主义的创始人在布鲁塞尔建立了共产主义通讯委员会，他们在这个委员会里坚持必须在共产主义运动中肃清这种无用的小资产阶级社会主义分子。文集的第二部分，有恩格斯1846年致布鲁塞尔共产主义通讯委员会的两封信，这些信反映了他在巴黎反对“真正社会主义者”和蒲鲁东等人的斗争。
    马克思和恩格斯对于小资产阶级的“真正社会主义”的批判也打中了现代修正主义，因为现代修正主义否认唯物主义对唯心主义进行坚决斗争的必要性，歪曲马克思主义的灵魂——唯物主义辩证法的实质，曲解阶级斗争的革命理论及其主要思想，即无产阶级同资产阶级间利益的不可调和性、无产阶级同资产阶级思想意识的不可调和性。
    马克思和恩格斯对非无产阶级思想，对脱离革命道路的变节行为所进行的积极斗争，是给每一个马克思主义者的榜样。马克思和恩格斯对这种小资产阶级思潮进行了无情的斗争，把德国工人运动和社会主义运动的积极活动家从他们的影响之下解放出来，1847年建立了共产主义者同盟——无产阶级共产党的萌芽。
    文集中“松维尔代表大会和国际”、“论权威”和马克思、恩格斯的几封信，说明了他们反对拉萨尔派、蒲鲁东主义者、巴枯宁主义者以及国际工人协会内部其他宗派性的和小资产阶级的流派的斗争。
    在若干信函中，马克思和恩格斯严厉地抨击拉萨尔派——十九世纪六十至七十年代德国工人运动的机会主义者，抨击他们迁就当时在德国占统治地位的反动阶级，抨击他们放弃革命策略、放弃争取民主的斗争，抨击他们离开无产阶级国际主义的原则而爬到资产阶级民族主义的阵地上去。
    文集中还有几篇文章和书信，其内容是反对巴枯宁的信徒、反对在国际内部进行分裂活动的无政府主义者的。在“松维尔代表大会和国际”一文和若干书信中，马克思和恩格斯揭露，无政府主义派的策略的基本原则是国际民族联邦和支部的完全自治，国际工人运动力量的完全分散。在反对无政府主义者的斗争中，马克思主义的创始人经常坚持无产阶级政党最重要的建党原则，即民主集中制的原则。恩格斯嘲笑了无政府主义派的组织原则，——既无统一的领导，又没有党的纪律，也没有少数服从多数的原则。（“松维尔代表大会和国际”）在“论权威”一文中、在致无政府主义者切尔扎吉的信中，以及文集的其他材料中，恩格斯还指出无政府主义者对权威、对民主集中制、对专政的攻击是荒谬和反动的。
    在七十年代初，马克思和恩格斯领导的第一国际，完成了自己的历史任务，它协助西欧若干国家组织了无产阶级的社会主义的政党。马克思主义的创始人在这种新的条件下，十分重视在理论上保证形成中的社会主义政党能有站得住脚的革命原则。他们毫不倦怠地为保持共产主义理论的纯洁性而斗争。“哥达纲领批判”鲜明地描绘出他们反对无原则地同拉萨尔派妥协，反对企图离开无产阶级的国际主义原则，反对歪曲马克思关于无产阶级国家和专政的理论的斗争。马克思在这一作品中提出了过渡时期的经典性的定义，指出无产阶级专政是这一过渡时期的国家形式，天才地表述了共产主义社会有两个阶段的原理。
    “哥达纲领批判”、“致倍倍尔、威·李卜克内西、威·白拉克等人（“通告信”）”、恩格斯给“论住宅问题”第二版写的序言，以及马克思和恩格斯的许多信函证明，马克思和恩格斯对工人运动中的机会主义进行了不断的激烈的斗争。马克思和恩格斯曾不止一次地指出，为了使无产阶级政党不要遭受机会主义的腐化，应当经常肃清自己内部机会主义地腐化着的分子。
    对于德国社会民主党运动，马克思和恩格斯强调必须对工人政党的右翼进行斗争，对社会民主党内部的机会主义进行无情的战斗。他们并且用同样的坚决性同法国社会主义运动中的以及其他国家工人运动中的右翼进行斗争。
    对于英美的社会主义者，马克思和恩格斯也揭露他们的机会主义，并且批评他们的教条主义和宗派主义，以及他们脱离工人运动而孤立的作风。恩格斯在给左尔格的信里着重指出，马克思主义不是教条，而是行动的指南。
    列宁总是用敬佩的口吻指出马克思和恩格斯对机会主义（在他们逝世之后在新的历史条件下，这一机会主义又发展成为修正主义）所进行的彻底的不断的斗争。列宁在击溃第二国际的修正主义方面，作了卓绝的贡献。
    目前，国际共产主义运动的大发展，引起了帝国主义分子的极大恐惧。他们除了动员一切力量从正面对社会主义国家进行疯狂的攻击以外，并且利用革命队伍中某些机会主义分子从内部来破坏国际共产主义运动。这就是现代修正主义思潮抬头的客观原因。
    共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的宣言指出，现代修正主义是同无产阶级和共产主义不相容的一种思想意识的表现。修正主义的根源是资产阶级和小资产阶级的影响，是对于帝国主义压力的投降。因此，对现代修正主义进行坚决的斗争，是国际共产主义运动在目前阶段的极重要的任务。收入本文集的马克思和恩格斯的著作和书信，可以帮助我们更深刻地研究马克思主义的创始人是怎样对机会主义进行不调和的斗争的，可以帮助我们更有效地对资产阶级思想意识、对现代修正主义进行斗争。
