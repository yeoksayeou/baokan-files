Why

    Tea Can Refresh the Mind
    After studying or working, drinking a cup of strong tea can make you feel more energetic. This is because tea contains a type of biological alkali that can directly stimulate the central nervous system, increase the working capacity of striated muscles, and increase the excitability of the heart muscle.
    Biological alkali is also called caffeine. It is a white, silky crystal with a bitter taste and is easily soluble in hot water. Coffee and cocoa also contain this alkali. The content in tea varies depending on the variety of tea, but is generally highest at 1% to 4.8%. When this alkali is needed, it is usually extracted from waste tea leaves. (Lu)

专栏：为什么

    茶能提神
    在学习或工作之后，饮上一杯浓茶，会觉得精神兴奋一些。这是因为茶叶中含有一种生物硷，能直接引起中枢神经系统的兴奋作用，增加横纹肌的工作能力，增高心肌的兴奋力量。
    生物硷又叫咖啡硷，是一种白色丝状结晶，味道很苦，容易溶解在热水中。咖啡和可可内也含有这硷。在茶叶中的含量，因茶的品种而不同，一般最高是1％到4.8％。需要这硷时，一般都用废料的茶叶末来提炼。　（卢）
