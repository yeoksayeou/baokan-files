Brotherly Friendship
    One afternoon on April 21st, the phone rang at the People's Committee of Renxi Township, Liuyang County, Hunan. The county committee's working group stationed in Zhangfang called, calling on people to support the farmers of Xiaohe Township in transplanting rice seedlings.
    This news quickly spread throughout the township. As dusk approached, the members of the fifth team of Tushi Cooperative were working in the fields, rushing to finish the transplanting work. The cooperative director, Li Mao’an, came over and said with a smile, "I have good news for you. The township party committee wants us to support Xiaohe Township in transplanting rice seedlings!" Before the cooperative director could finish speaking, the members said in unison, "I'll go! I'll go!"
    At dawn on the 22nd, the farmers participating in the transplanting support, carrying torches and luggage, gathered from all directions at Hu’ao (place name), quickly gathering more than four hundred people, rushing towards Xiaohe Township like a torrent. After only four hours, they traveled forty-five li to reach their destination—Xiaohe Township.
    After only a short rest, the support army went to the fields to transplant rice seedlings. At night, torches replaced the sun, and the night turned into day. The people’s enthusiasm drove away fatigue! After a short day and a half and two nights of battle, the more than four hundred people who came to support from Renxi Township and the more than one hundred and thirty people who came to support from Fengxi Township transplanted 802 mu of early rice.
    By the evening of the 23rd, all 7,808 mu of early rice that the township should have transplanted were transplanted, ensuring that the rice seedlings were transplanted on time and according to plan.

The Gratitude of the Xin’an River Hydropower Station
    In a cadre guesthouse in Shanghai, the reporter met Comrade Zhu Guangjun, Deputy Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Planning Commission, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou. He was on a special trip to Shanghai to discuss the supply of equipment for the Xin’an River Hydropower Station with the Shanghai industrial departments. The staff of the Xin’an River Hydropower Station have decided to generate electricity one year ahead of schedule, but achieving this plan requires the support of many fraternal regions, especially Shanghai, to manufacture various machines and equipment in advance. I asked Comrade Zhu how the work was progressing. He smiled with satisfaction as soon as he heard, handed me a purchase order, and then enthusiastically said: "This is a purchase order I brought from the Xin'an River construction site, the quantity is quite large, unexpectedly after coming to Shanghai I only had one meeting, in less than half a day, all the tasks were arranged, we are really happy from the bottom of our hearts." I took the purchase order and looked at it. There were seventeen or eight kinds of machines ordered on it, some of which were new products that Shanghai had never manufactured before, such as more than twenty agitators and condensers for refrigeration equipment, five vacuum suction pumps for cement, and fourteen belt conveyors.... Everyone in Shanghai knows that this year is the year with the heaviest production tasks for Shanghai's machinery factories since liberation. The tasks have increased by more than double compared to last year. At this unprecedentedly tense moment, Shanghai's factories still accepted such a heavy cooperative task from the Xin'an River Hydropower Station construction site without hesitation, which is indeed no ordinary matter.
    Deputy Director Zhu continued: "What touched me most was that I felt that comrades in many factories in Shanghai regarded supporting the Xin’an River Hydropower Station as if it were their own business. The day before yesterday, at a symposium of several factory cadres, people heard that if the Xin’an River Hydropower Station generated electricity one year ahead of schedule, it would supply the country with 1.8 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, which, calculated at Shanghai’s electricity price, would be 360 million yuan. Many factory comrades took the initiative to propose increasing cooperative tasks. For example, the Shanghai Hudong Shipyard originally had difficulties in the supply of raw materials, but they said: “We can start by saving raw materials and finding substitutes to build more machines for the Xin’an River Hydropower Station.” The original delivery time for the Shanghai Electric Machinery Factory was 1959, but now they also took the initiative to adjust it to this year.
    “The comrades of the Xin’an River Hydropower Station thank the comrades in Shanghai for their cooperation. We guarantee that we will do the construction work of the hydropower station faster and better!” He wanted me to tell the comrades in Shanghai what he said. (Reported by our reporter)

### 互助协作　携手共进

    互助协作　携手共进
    兄弟般的情谊
    4月21日下午，湖南浏阳县人溪乡人民委员会的电话铃响了，话筒里传来了县委驻张坊工作组的号召：发动群众，支援小河乡农民插秧。
    这个消息很快便在全乡传开了。天快黑的时候，突石社第五队的社员们正在田间突击插秧扫尾工作，社主任李茂晏走来，笑嘻嘻地说：“告诉你们一个好消息，乡党委要我们去支援小河乡插秧！”社主任话音未落，社员们异口同声地说：“我去！我去！”
    22日黎明，参加支援插秧的农民们就打着火把，提着行李，从四方八面往虎坳（地名）集中，很快汇集了四百多人，像洪流似的向小河乡奔去。仅仅走四个多钟头，就赶了四十五里路，到达了目的地——小河乡。
    只休息了一会，支援大军就下田插秧，晚上，火把代替了太阳，黑夜变成了白天，人们的干劲，赶走了疲劳！经过短短一个半白天和两个晚上的战斗，人溪乡来支援的四百多人和凤溪乡来支援的一百三十多人，就插完早稻八百零二亩。
    到23日晚上止，全乡应插的七千八百零八亩早稻全部插好了，保证了按季节按计划插好秧。新安江水电站的感激
    在上海市一个干部招待所里，记者会见了刚从杭州来到上海的浙江省计划委员会副主任朱光军同志，他是专程来与上海工业部门洽谈新安江水电站的设备供应问题的。新安江水电站的职工已决定提前一年发电，但是实现这个计划还需要许多兄弟地区，尤其是上海的支援，提前把各种机器设备制造出来。我问朱同志工作接洽得怎么样？他一听就满意地笑了起来，随手交给我一张订货单，接着热情地说：“这是我从新安江工地带来的订货单，数量相当多，想不到来到上海只开了一次会，前后不到半天时间，就把所有的任务安排下来了，我们真是从心里感到高兴。”我接过这张订货单一看，上面订购的机器有十七、八种，其中有些还是上海从来没有制造过的新产品，如冷藏设备的鼓动器、冷凝器就要二十多台，水泥真空吸出泵就要五台，皮带输送机要十四台……。在上海的人都知道，今年上海的机械工厂是解放后生产任务最繁重的一年，任务比去年增加了一倍还多，在这个空前紧张的时刻，上海的工厂还是毫不迟缓地就接受了新安江水电站建设工地这样繁重的协作任务，这确实不是一件普通的事情。
    朱副主任接着说：最使我感动的是，我觉得上海的许多工厂的同志都把支援新安江水电站看成像自己的事情一样。前天，在几个工厂干部的座谈会上，人们一听说如果新安江水电站提前一年发电，就会给国家多供应十八亿度电，按上海的电价计算，就是三亿六千元的人民币，许多工厂的同志都主动提出增加协作任务，像上海沪东造船厂，本来原材料供应有困难，但他们说：“我们可以从节约原材料、寻找代用品着手来为新安江水电站造更多的机器。”上海电机厂原来订货时间是1959年，现在也主动调整到今年交货。
    “新安江水电站的同志感谢上海同志们的协作，我们保证把水电站的建设工作做得更快、更好！”他要我把他的这句话告诉上海的同志。　　（本报记者）（附图片）
