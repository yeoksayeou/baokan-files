Xingyi and Dali Counties' Cadres Study Technology, Improve Work Style
Turning Barren Land into Fertile Soil, Becoming Experts Themselves

    (Reported by this newspaper) The Guizhou Daily reported: Not long ago, the Xingyi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, together with the county's agricultural technicians, conducted several meaningful technical studies focusing on the problem of soil improvement. This played a very positive role in improving the leadership style of the County Committee and fostering a spirit among cadres to study technology.

    Xingyi County has about 100,000 mu of red-yellow sticky mud and red-yellow sandy mud, which need to be improved. How to improve them? The County Committee began studying this issue with agricultural technicians before the Spring Festival. After consulting agricultural science books, conducting practical field investigations and comparisons, and talking with experienced farmers, they identified the reasons why crops did not grow well: the soil lacked cohesion and organic matter. Based on these characteristics, they summarized five original methods of soil improvement used by the masses: 1. Applying large amounts of peat. 2. Applying lime to reduce soil acidity. 3. There is a type of black mud on the mountains called humus, which is very good when mixed into the soil. 4. Applying more general fertilizer. 5. Deep plowing to retain moisture.

    They studied these methods and guided the masses throughout the county in soil improvement work. However, in the process of soil improvement by the masses, the failure to distinguish between the properties of the two types of soil led to the practice of indiscriminately mixing sand into the land. After the County Committee discovered this situation, they conducted a second study, purchased laboratory instruments, and further clarified the shortcomings of the two types of soil structure. The conclusion was that yellow sticky mud had excessive colloid content, while yellow sandy mud had insufficient colloid content. The common shortcomings of both types of soil were high acidity, poor cohesion, and lack of phosphorus. It was confirmed that both types of soil could be improved by applying peat, humus, chemical fertilizers, and lime, but each mu would require 50,000 to 60,000 jin to be fundamentally transformed. The study of these methods further sparked a movement to improve soil and transform sloping land. Xingyi County has now used these methods to improve 74,000 mu of soil.

    In addition, they conducted an analysis of burned soil. Farmers in Xingyi County have a habit of burning soil, and the soil turns red after burning. The County Committee comrades felt that this was not quite right, but they could not figure out whether it was good or bad, so they neither dared to approve nor oppose it. This year, some cooperatives were burning soil when sowing seeds. After burning, the black soil turned into red mud bricks, which made a clanging sound when knocked. The County Committee comrades were very concerned about this practice, so they convened the county's technicians to conduct a study. After testing and comparison, it was proven that blackening the soil by smoking it was good, as it could increase nitrogen content, but burning the soil red was more harmful than beneficial. This was because burning the soil red would destroy the organic matter and organic colloids in the soil, the physical structure would also deteriorate, and the living organisms in the soil would be completely destroyed. After explaining the reasons clearly, the farmers also realized the harm of burning the soil red and changed this old habit.

    Recently, they also studied the effectiveness of granular fertilizers.

    Around these several organized studies, they developed a strong interest in studying technology. They thought about and studied technical problems whenever they encountered them, consulting with technicians and experienced farmers when they did not understand, and consulting relevant agricultural books. Because the leading comrades of the County Committee often discussed technical issues with the technicians, and sometimes gave them topics to study, the technicians felt that their work was supported, and their enthusiasm for work was also improved. They were happy to talk with the leading comrades and contribute their technical knowledge.

    (Reported by this newspaper) Yunnan Province's Dali County is starting to analyze and investigate the county's soil, fertilizer, and crops. The county will conduct soil analysis of each of the county's more than 120,000 mu of paddy fields, prepare land appraisal forms, map soil maps, and store them in "archives." This is an important measure taken by Dali County this year in its advance toward nature.

    Dali County's agricultural production is relatively developed. In 1957, the average yield per mu reached more than 700 jin. This year, the County Committee is determined to strive to become a "thousand-jin county." To this end, in addition to focusing on the two major measures of water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, it was decided to thoroughly investigate the county's soil in one year and complete the transformation in two years. At present, the county's water conservancy conditions have been greatly improved, and the amount of fertilizer accumulated has exceeded the original target, with an average fertilization rate of 10,000 jin per mu for spring crops. The current problems that need to be solved are: What is the nature of the county's soil? What are the components of the various types of farm fertilizers? What kind of fertilizer should be applied to what kind of soil? What kind of crops are suitable for planting in what kind of soil? and so on.

    Therefore, this year, after clarifying the essence of the local soil, the County Committee will mobilize the whole people to implement major reforms. First, change saline-alkali soil to slightly alkaline and neutral soil. This will be solved by lowering the groundwater level, washing away the salt from the heavily saline-alkali soil, applying more organic fertilizers, and planting more green manure crops. Second, change red soil to neutral soil. Red soil is strongly acidic and low in phosphorus. This will be solved by applying more organic fertilizers such as peat, sea mud, pond mud, and manure. In addition, it is also planned to apply large amounts of lime and phosphate fertilizer. Third, change low-lying wetland and cold paddy fields. Measures such as raising, leveling, and applying more heating fertilizers will be taken to ensure a bumper harvest in the rainy season. Fourth, plant more windbreak forest belts. Change sandy soil to sandy fertile soil. Fifth, change heavy clay soil to clay-sandy soil. Heavy clay soil is impermeable, muddy when wet, and hard when dry, making it difficult to cultivate and for crops to grow. The reform method is to add sand and provide appropriate drainage.

    Another major measure to improve soil in this county is deep plowing. In the past, due to the limitations of backward production tools such as old wooden plows, local farmers generally plowed only three inches deep. This year, new agricultural implements such as double-wheeled double-share plows and eight-inch walking plows are used for plowing the fields, generally requiring a plowing depth of seven inches, turning up the soil under the three-inch-thick topsoil. This will greatly improve the structure of the soil.

    Another measure for improving soil is to increase the application of fertilizer according to local conditions. To this end, at the same time as analyzing the soil, a scientific analysis of the nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium content of various farm fertilizers will be carried out so that fertilizers can be applied reasonably and in large quantities based on soil, crops, and other factors, giving full play to the role of fertilizer.

    Dali County will also conduct plant analysis of the county's main crops such as rice, wheat, and broad beans through investigation and trial planting and summarizing the experience of experienced farmers to determine what kind of crops and what kind of varieties of crops are suitable for planting in what kind of soil. This year, the county is testing and will test more than 70 varieties of famous wheat, rice, and other varieties from inside and outside the province. A comprehensive evaluation will be made based on the adaptability of the varieties to soil, climate, sunshine, water conservancy, and fertilizer conditions, as well as the early and late maturity, high and low yields, and strong and weak resistance to disasters. In early April, Dali County had already selected 60 members with junior high school and elementary school education from various agricultural cooperatives to study soil analysis. (Attached pictures)

    兴义和大理两县的干部钻研技术改进作风
    使土圵变肥沃　使自己成内行
    本报讯　贵州日报报道：不久以前，中共兴义县委和县里的农业技术人员一起，围绕改良土壤问题，先后进行了几次有意义的技术研究，对改进县委的领导作风、培养干部钻研技术问题，起到了很好的作用。
    兴义全县有十万亩左右的红黄粘泥和红黄砂泥，需要进行改良。怎样改良呢？县委在春节前就和农业技术人员一起开始研究。经过翻阅农业科学书籍，下田实际调查、比较，并和有经验的农民交谈，找出了长不好庄稼的原因，是土壤缺乏团力和有机物质。根据这种特点，他们总结出群众中原有的五种改良土壤的办法：1、大量施用草炭。2、施用石灰，减低土壤的酸性。3、山上有一种黑泥，叫腐植质层，掺到土壤里很好。4、多施一般肥料。5、深耕，保持水分。
    他们研究出这些办法，指导全县群众进行改良土壤的工作。但是在群众改良土壤过程中，由于没有分别两种土壤的性质，发生一概往地里掺砂的作法。县委发现这种情况后，又作了第二次研究，购置了化验仪器，进一步弄清了两种土壤结构的缺点，结论是：黄粘泥胶质过重，而黄砂泥胶质过轻，两种土壤的共同缺点是酸性大、团力差、缺磷质。肯定两种土壤都可以用施草炭、腐植质层、化肥、石灰来改良，每亩需要五、六万斤才能根本改造过来。研究出这些办法，进一步掀起了改良土壤、改造坡土的运动。兴义全县现在已用这种办法改良土壤七万四千亩。
    此外，他们对火烧土进行过一次分析。兴义县农民有火烧土的习惯，土经过火烧，都变成红色的了。县委同志看到这种情况，感到有些不对头，但又弄不清楚到底是好是坏，所以一不敢赞成，二不敢反对。今年撒秧时，有的合作社又在烧土。烧过后黑土变成了红泥块，敲着噹噹响。县委同志对这种作法非常耽心，于是就召集县里的技术人员进行研究。经过化验、对比，证明把土熏成黑的，是好的，可以增氮质，但把土烧红害多利少。因为把土烧红就破坏了土壤中的有机质、有机胶质，物理结构也变坏了，土壤中的有生物更是完全毁灭。把道理讲清楚以后，农民们也认识到了把土烧红的坏处，改变了这个旧习惯。
    最近，他们还研究了颗粒肥料的效用问题。
    围绕上面这几次有组织的研究，他们对钻研技术问题发生了浓厚兴趣；碰到技术问题就思考、研究，不懂就向技术人员请教，向有经验的农民请教，翻阅有关农业书籍。由于县委领导同志经常和技术人员谈技术问题，有时出些题目叫他们研究，技术人员感到自己的工作得到支持，工作积极性也提高了，他们乐于和领导同志交谈，贡献自己的技术知识。
    本报讯　云南省大理县正在着手对全县土壤、肥料和农作物进行分析和调查。这个县将把全县十二万多亩水田一丘一丘地作出土壤分析，拟出土地鉴定表，测绘出土壤图，存入“档案”。这是大理县今年向自然进军中的一项重要措施。
    大理县的农业生产较为发达，1957年每亩平均产量已达七百多斤。今年，县委决心争取成为千斤县。为此，除抓水利和积肥两大措施以外，决定对全县土壤一年摸清底子，两年改造完毕。现在，全县水利条件已有很大改变，积肥量已突破原来的指标，平均每亩大春作物的施肥量达到一万斤。当前需要解决的问题是：全县的土壤是什么性质？形形色色的农家肥料是含何种成分？那种性质的土壤应上那种肥？那种土壤适宜种那些品种的作物？等等。
    因此，今年县委将在摸清当地土壤本质以后，动员全民，实行大改革。第一，改盐碱土为微碱土和中性土。用降低地下水位，洗去重盐碱土中的盐份，多施有机质肥料，多种绿肥作物等办法解决。第二，改红壤土为中性土。红壤土是酸性强，含磷少。采取多施草炭、海泥、塘泥、厩肥等有机质肥料来解决。另外，还准备大量施用石灰和磷肥。第三，改低洼湿地冷阱田。采取抬高、填平，多施热性肥料等办法，确保雨季丰收。第四，多种防风林带。改砂石土为砂肥土。第五，改重粘土为粘沙土。重粘土不透水，湿时泥泞，干时坚硬，耕作困难，农作物难于生长。改革的办法是增加沙土，适当排水。
    这个县改良土壤的另一重大措施是深耕。过去由于老木犁这种落后生产工具的限制，当地农民一般只犁三寸深。今年用双轮双铧犁和八寸步犁等新式农具犁田，一般都要求犁深到七寸，把三寸厚的表土下的土壤翻上来。这就会大大改良土壤的结构。
    改良土壤还有一个措施是因地制宜地增施肥料。为此，与分析土壤同时，还将对各种各样的农家肥料进行含氮磷钾成份的科学分析，以便根据土壤、作物等因素，合理地多施肥，充分发挥肥力的作用。
    大理县还将通过调查试种和总结老农的经验，对全县主产的稻谷、小麦、蚕豆等农作物进行植物分析，确定何种农作物以及农作物的何种品种适宜种于何种土壤。今年，全县试种和将试种小麦、水稻等省内外名种七十多个品种。根据品种适应土质、气候、阳光、水利和肥料的情况，以及成熟期早迟，产量高低，抗灾能力强弱等情况，作全面的鉴定。4月初，大理县已从各农业社抽调有初中和小学文化水平的社员六十人，学习土壤分析。（附图片）
