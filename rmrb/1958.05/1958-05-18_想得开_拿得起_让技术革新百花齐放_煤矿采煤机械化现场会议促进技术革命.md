Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 17th – From May 5th to 14th, the Ministry of Coal Industry and the National Committee of the Coal Miners' Union of China jointly held a national on-site meeting on mechanized coal mining in the Jiaohe Coal Mine, Jilin Province, to promote the innovation of coal mining technology across the country, accelerate the process of mechanized coal mining, and expedite the arrival of the technological revolution in the coal industry.

　　The meeting exchanged more than 120 experiences in mechanized coal mining, tunneling, transportation, hoisting, small-scale mechanization and automation. These experiences were all created based on the specific conditions of different types of mines and from the actual needs of production. These experiences made people realize that as long as they think it through and take it up, miracles will happen. One working face in the Taozhuang Coal Mine in Shandong happened to be under a riverbed, and in summer, river water seeped into the mine, affecting coal mining. To solve this problem, the cutter disc of the coal cutting machine was lengthened from 2.4 meters to 3.47 meters, increasing the coal mining progress, so as to complete the mining of this coal seam before the rainy season. Lengthening the cutter disc by so much exceeded the technical specifications, but the workers were not constrained by this. After experimentation, they boldly modified the cutter disc. This fact provided a great education to representatives of some coal mines that were still limited by the mechanical structure and used short cutter discs. Someone on the spot composed a jingle saying: "Taozhuang Mine dares to do it, a long cutter disc is equal to two cycles, and production leaps forward without difficulty." The Jiaohe Coal Mine has been using a Type 30 heavy-duty chute with reverse chain transportation for some time. This improvement is very simple; simply changing the original design from forward pulling to reverse pulling can avoid frequent chain breakage. In the past, some people in the Benxi Coal Mine had made this suggestion, but it was opposed because it was considered a violation of regulations. This time, after seeing the Jiaohe Coal Mine's practice at the meeting, the engineers of the Benxi Coal Mine were greatly inspired and immediately wrote a letter back suggesting rapid promotion. Several years ago, the Datong Coal Mine successfully tested an experience similar to the overall movement of the chute in the Tongxiaqiao Coal Mine, but at that time, people emphasized that one cycle of operation per day and night was considered formal, and it was thought that shortening the time for the overall movement of the chute was not of much significance, so this creation was not promoted. This time, when they examined their conservative thinking at the meeting, they asked themselves: Why did we think so rigidly at that time? Why didn't we develop this experience to engage in multi-cycle operations?

　　The meeting fully demonstrated that after the rectification campaign, people's minds were liberated, which promoted the technological leap forward, and the technological leap forward in turn promoted the liberation of thought. This interaction and repeated improvement not only made people's thinking increasingly active, but also, through the activeness of thought, inevitably led to a new situation of a hundred flowers blooming in technology, prompting the early arrival of the technological revolution in China's coal industry. The experience of coal mines in various places has also fully proven this law. The meeting pointed out that to grasp this law, it is necessary to put politics in command and combine politics with professional work. The experience gained by the Jiaohe Coal Mine and the Jiawang Coal Mine in this regard is worth emulating in various places. The Jiaohe Coal Mine, with the Party Committee as the leading core, gave play to the organizational role of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the trade union, and relied on the masses to adhere to the direction of mechanized coal mining for a long time. Now, it has developed from manual mining several years ago to using coal cutting machines in every working face, with a mechanized coal mining rate of 86%, making it the coal mine with the highest mechanized coal mining rate in the country. After realizing mechanized coal mining, some manual operations in the production process could not adapt, and a series of imbalances appeared. Under this situation, instead of passively waiting, they actively mobilized the masses to create a large number of simple, practical, and inexpensive small machines, combining the large machines supplied by the state with the small machines created by the masses, significantly improving production capacity. On the basis of the liberation of the masses' minds in the double-anti movement, the Jiawang Coal Mine launched the "One Hundred Rationalization Proposals Per Person Movement." In just twenty days in April, the workers put forward more than 400,000 proposals, including many major experiences worth promoting nationwide, such as the overall movement of the chute in the Xiaqiao Mine.

　　After discussion, the delegates unanimously guaranteed that they would make full use of existing equipment and further promote mechanized coal mining. This year, the mechanized coal mining rate of state-owned coal mines nationwide should overfulfill the 40% target, an increase of 5.5% compared to last year; each unit will increase the utilization rate, efficiency, and recovery efficiency per worker by 10% to 50% on the original basis; and reduce the direct cost of coal mining by 5% to 10%.

　　想得开  拿得起
    让技术革新百花齐放
    煤矿采煤机械化现场会议促进技术革命
    新华社长春17日电　煤炭工业部和中国煤矿工会全国委员会5日到14日在吉林省蛟河煤矿联合召开全国煤矿采煤机械化现场会议，推动全国煤矿革新采煤技术，加速采煤机械化的进程，促进煤炭工业的技术革命早日到来。
    会议交流了采煤机械化、掘进、运输、提升、小型机械化自动化等经验一百二十多项。这些经验都是根据不同类型矿井的具体条件、从生产实际需要出发创造出来的。这些经验使人们认识到，只要想得开、拿得起，奇迹就会出现。山东陶庄煤矿有一个工作面正好在一条河道底下，夏季河水向矿井渗透，影响采煤；要解决这个问题，只要把截煤机截盘由二·四公尺加长到三·四七公尺，加大采煤进度，就能抢在雨季前采完这块煤。截盘加长这样多，超越了技术规范，但是职工们没有受这个束缚，经过试验，终于大胆地改长了截盘。这一事实，给一些仍然受机械结构限制、使用短截盘的煤矿的代表以很大的教育。有人当场编出顺口溜说：“陶庄矿真敢干，长截盘一次等于两循环，生产跃进不费难。”蛟河煤矿采用三○型重型溜子倒拉链逆向运输，已经有不少时间了。这个改进很简单，只要把原来设计规定的正拉改为反拉，就可以避免经常断链。以前本溪煤矿也有人提过这种建议，却遭到反对，认为是违反规定。这次本溪煤矿的工程师在会上看到蛟河煤矿的做法后，得到很大启发，立即写信回去建议迅速推广。大同煤矿几年前曾经试验成功同夏桥煤矿整体移溜子相似的经验，但是当时人们强调一昼夜搞一个循环作业才算正规，认为整体移溜子的时间缩短了也没有多大意义，因此这项创造没有得到推广。这次，他们在会上检查保守思想时责问自己：为什么当时想得那么死？为什么不发展这个经验搞多循环作业？
    会议充分显示出：经过整风，人们的思想解放了，促使了技术跃进，技术跃进又促进了思想解放。这种相互作用、反复提高的结果，不但使人们思想日益活跃，而且通过思想的活跃必然在技术上出现一个百花齐放的新局面，促使我国煤炭工业的技术革命提前到来。各地煤矿的经验也完全证明了这个规律。会议指出，要掌握这个规律，必须政治挂帅，使政治与业务相结合。蛟河煤矿、贾汪煤矿在这方面取得的经验，值得各地仿效。蛟河煤矿以党委为领导核心，发挥党、团、工会的组织作用，依靠群众长期坚持采煤机械化的方向，现在已由几年前的手工开采，发展成为每个工作面都使用截煤机，采煤机械化程度达到86％，成为全国采煤机械化程度最高的煤矿。这个矿在实现采煤机械化以后，生产过程中的一些手工操作不能适应，曾出现了一系列的不平衡；在这种情况下，他们不是消极等待，而是积极发动群众创造大量简易、实用、花钱少的小型机具，使国家供应的大型机械和群众创造的小型机械结合，显著地提高了生产能力。贾汪煤矿在双反运动群众思想解放的基础上，开展“每人百条合理化建议运动”，仅4月间的二十天里，职工们就提出了四十多万条建议，其中出现了像夏桥矿整体移溜子等许多值得在全国推广的重大经验。
    到会代表经过讨论后，一致保证要充分利用现有设备，进一步推行采煤机械化。今年全国国营煤矿采煤机械化程度要超额完成40％的指标，比去年提高5.5％；各单位在原有的基础上将机械使用率、效能和每工回采效率提高10％到50％；降低采煤直接成本5％到10％。
