Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 13th: More than two thousand fishermen in Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, held a rally on the 11th to vehemently protest the Japanese fishing vessels' violation of the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement, their intrusion into prohibited fishing zones to sabotage our fishing production, and the barbaric atrocity of drowning our fisherman Xu Shunlai.

More than twenty fishermen at the meeting exposed the facts that Japanese fishing vessels have repeatedly violated the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement in recent years, entering our prohibited fishing zones, threatening our fishing production and the safety of fishermen. From 1957 to May 1, 1958, the fishermen here had 6,800 baskets of their equipment damaged by Japanese fishing vessels, resulting in a loss of 6,800 dan of fish products, worth more than 149,000 yuan in RMB; in addition, 13 stationary fishing nets and 780 pairs of net baskets, and many other production tools of our fishermen were destroyed.

Guo Acai, a fisherman who was on the same small fishing boat as Xu Shunlai, described in detail at the meeting how their small fishing boat was intentionally hit by the Japanese fishing vessel "Ariake Maru" on May 1, and how Xu Shunlai was killed and drowned. He said that after Xu Shunlai fell into the water, the "Ariake Maru" not only did not rescue him, but deliberately rammed the small fishing boat and reversed more than fifty steps, preventing the small fishing boat from rushing to rescue him in time. After Xu Shunlai's body was recovered, the Japanese fishing vessel even chased after them, trying to sink the small fishing boat and destroy the evidence. Guo Acai's narration aroused the incomparable indignation of the fishermen present, who pointed out that the pirate behavior of Japanese fishing vessels is intolerable, and Japanese fishing vessels must compensate our side for all losses and bear full responsibility for this atrocity. Xu Shunlai's wife, Wang Xiantao, also accused the Japanese fishing vessels of atrocities at the meeting.

The meeting also exhibited the evidence of the crimes of the Japanese fishing vessels - the damaged small fishing boat and the photos of the deceased fisherman Xu Shunlai.

　　浙江玉环县二千多渔民集会
　　控诉日本渔轮的暴行
    新华社杭州13日电　浙江省玉环县渔民两千多人在11日举行集会，愤怒抗议日本渔轮违反中日渔业协定，侵入禁渔区破坏我渔业生产，并且淹死我渔民徐顺来的野蛮暴行。
    有二十多名渔民在会上揭发了近年来日本渔轮一再违反中日渔业协定，进入我禁渔区，威胁我渔业生产和渔民安全的事实。从1957年到1958年5月1日为止，这里的渔民被日本渔轮破坏的绲就有六千八百篮，损失渔产六千八百担，价值人民币十四万九千多元；此外还毁坏我渔民定置的张网十三张和网筐七百八十对等许多生产工具。
    同徐顺来在一条小钓船上的渔民郭阿才在会上详细地叙述了5月1日他们的小钓船被日本渔轮“有明丸”有意撞击和徐顺来被害淹死的经过。他说，当徐顺来落水以后，“有明丸”不但不抢救，而且故意顶住小钓船倒退了五十多步，使小钓船不能及时赶去抢救。徐顺来的尸体被捞起来以后，日本渔轮竟又追过来企图撞沉小钓船消灭罪证。郭阿才的叙述引起了到会渔民的无比愤慨，他们指出，日本渔轮的这种海盗行为是不能容忍的，日本渔轮必须赔偿我方的一切损失，并且对这一暴行负全部责任。徐顺来的妻子王仙桃也在会上控诉了日本渔轮的暴行。
    会上还展览了日本渔轮的罪证——被撞坏的小钓船和死难渔民徐顺来的照片。
