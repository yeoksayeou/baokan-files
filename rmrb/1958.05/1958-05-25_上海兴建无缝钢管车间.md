Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 24th. A seamless steel tube workshop with an annual output of 80,000 tons began construction at the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant on the 22nd.

The complete set of pipe rolling equipment used in this workshop is highly automated and mechanized, and is designed and manufactured independently by China. This is the first time in China's history.

After the completion of this workshop, the produced steel pipes will not only meet the needs of Shanghai's shipyards, chemical plants, nitrogen fertilizer plants, boiler plants and other factories, but also supply boiler tubes, locomotive tubes and other steel pipes needed by provinces in East China and South China. The cost of the products can be reduced by 50% compared with other small seamless steel tube plants.

According to past experience, it takes several years to build such a workshop; however, this workshop strives to be put into production within seven months, before the end of this year.

    上海兴建无缝钢管车间
    新华社上海24日电  一个年产量可以达到八万吨的无缝钢管车间22日在上海第一钢铁厂动工兴建。
    这个车间所用的整套轧管设备，自动化、机械化的程度较高，由我国自行设计制造。这在我国还是有史以来的第一次。
    这个车间建成以后，生产的钢管除了供给上海的造船厂、化工厂、氮肥厂、锅炉厂等工厂的需要以外，还可以供应华东、华南各省所需要的锅炉管、机车管及其他钢管。产品的成本同其他的小型无缝钢管厂相比可以降低50％。
    根据以往的经验，建设这样一个车间需要几年的时间；但是这个车间争取只用七个月的时间，在今年年底前投入生产。
