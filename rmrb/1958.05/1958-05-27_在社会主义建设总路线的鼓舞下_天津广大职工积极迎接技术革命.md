Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 26th: The general line for socialist construction formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has greatly inspired the broad masses of workers in Tianjin during the Great Leap Forward. Many people have expressed their determination to respond to the great call for technological and cultural revolutions put forward by the congress with practical actions.

　　At the Tianjin Power Machinery Plant, where technology is advancing by leaps and bounds and monthly production leap forward plans are being completed, the Party committee held a meeting today. Based on the spirit of the general line for socialist construction, the committee decided to further mobilize workers to carry out the technological innovation movement and put 110 major technological innovation measures into production as soon as possible. To date, workers at this factory have already put forward more than 3,300 technological innovation proposals, increasing production capacity by 80% to 120%. The workers in the foundry workshop, which has always been considered to have little potential for innovation, have also proposed, under the illumination of the general line, to implement eleven "izations" of technology measures in the near future, such as mechanized molding, automated sand filling, and multiple casting per mold. This will fundamentally change the manual operation production methods in the foundry workshop.

　　Wang Shutian, a famous technical innovation expert and fitter at the North China Sewing Machine Factory, is preparing to convert fifteen old lathes into semi-automated hexagonal lathes with veteran workers Gao Xuewen, Qi Shuyun, and others. After these lathes are put into production, they can greatly improve the quality of sewing machine parts, double the output, and reduce the labor intensity of workers. Cui Yinnian, an engineer at the Daxin Enamel Insulated Wire Factory who has successfully trial-produced high-strength paint and many other polymer compounds, proposed guaranteeing the successful trial production of fifty important new products within this year after seeing the "Eighth National Congress" put forward the call for technological revolution.

　　Five thousand technical innovation activists from the Tianjin Light Industry System expressed their determination at today's gathering to respond to the Party's call to embrace the technological revolution. In the initiative they unanimously adopted, they proposed that each person should put forward five technological innovation measures this year, and suggested that 80,000 light industry workers in the city put forward and implement 100,000 technological innovations within this year.

    在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下
    天津广大职工积极迎接技术革命
    新华社天津26日电　中共八大二次会议制定的社会主义建设总路线，大大鼓舞了大跃进中的天津市广大职工。许多人表示决心以实际行动响应大会提出的技术革命和文化革命的伟大号召。
    在技术突飞猛进、月月完成生产跃进计划的天津动力机厂，今天举行了党委会议，根据社会主义建设总路线的精神，决定进一步发动工人开展技术革新运动，并把一百一十项重大技术革新措施尽快地投入生产。到现在为止，这个工厂的职工已经提出了三千三百多件技术革新的建议，使生产能力提高了80％到120％。一向被认为没什么革新的铸工车间职工，也在总路线的光芒照耀下提出要在近期实现造型机械化、装砂自动化、一模多铸化等十一“化”技术措施，这将从根本上改变铸工车间手工操作的生产面貌。
    著名的技术革新能手、华北缝纫机制造厂钳工王叔田，已准备和老师傅高学文、齐树云等把十五台破旧车床改装成半自动化的六角车床。这些车床投入生产后，可以大大提高缝纫机零件质量，成倍地提高产量和减轻工人的劳动强度。大新漆包线厂工程师、曾经试制成功高强度漆等许多种高分子化合物的崔荫年，看到“八大”提出技术革命的号召后，提出保证在今年年内试制成功五十种重要的新产品。
    天津轻工业系统的五千名技术革新积极分子在今天的集会上，表示决心响应党的号召迎接技术革命。他们一致通过的倡议书中提出：今年每人要提出五项技术革新措施，并建议全市八万名轻工业职工在今年内提出和实现技术革新十万项。
