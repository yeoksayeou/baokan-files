Young Trees Grow into Forests, Old Trees Do Not Decline
Guangdong Rubber Plantations Flourish

    (Reported by this newspaper) Large areas of Guangdong Province, from Hainan Island in the south to Maoming County in the north, have gradually established rubber plantations.

    Over the past five years, due to the implementation of reasonable close planting, the construction of protective forest belts, wind and cold prevention, terracing, planting large amounts of cover crops, maintaining soil and water, and increasing soil fertility, an environment suitable for rubber growth has been created, compensating for the shortcomings of nature. Now, these originally barren lands have become rubber forests with lush green trees. Some rubber trees have already begun to be harvested.

    The decades-old rubber trees on Hainan Island, which have passed their peak production period, are still not declining under the painstaking care and management of the workers. Some do not shed their leaves in winter, and the average yield per tree reaches more than one kilogram.

    Small Statistics

    Guangdong has fifty state-owned rubber farms. The current rubber planting area in Guangdong is thirty-seven times the total area planted in the fifty years before liberation. Rubber production has increased by approximately 50%. In the year of liberation, the average annual dry rubber yield per tree was 1.484 jin, which increased to 2.2 jin in 1956.

    The quality of rubber has also greatly improved. In the early days of liberation (1952), first-grade rubber accounted for only 13.2%, while third-grade and below accounted for 61.2%. Currently, the quality of rubber produced in Guangdong has caught up with world standards in terms of tensile strength, toughness, and other aspects. Among them, first-grade rubber accounts for 99%.

### 幼树成林老树不衰  广东橡胶园欣欣向荣

    幼树成林老树不衰
    广东橡胶园欣欣向荣
    本报讯　广东省南起海南岛北至茂名县的大片地区，已经逐步建立了成片的橡胶园。
    五年多以来由于推行合理密植，营造防护林带，防风防寒，开辟梯田，种植大量覆盖作物，保持水土，增加土地肥力等措施，创造了适宜橡胶生长的环境，弥补了大自然的缺陷，现在，在这些原是一片荒芜的土地上已经是橡胶成林，绿树成荫。一部分橡胶已经开始收刈。
    海南岛的数十年老橡胶树，旺产期已过，但在工人们苦心抚育管理下，还是老而不衰，有的经冬不落叶，平均每株产胶达一公斤以上。
    小统计
    广东有五十个国营橡胶农场。广东现在的橡胶种植面积，为解放前五十年总和的三十七倍。橡胶的产量提高约50％。解放那年胶树平均单株年产干胶一点四八四市斤，1956年提高到二点二市斤。
    橡胶的质量也有很大提高。解放初期（1952年）生产的一等胶只占13.2％，三等以下的61.2％。目前广东出产的橡胶质量已经在拉力、韧度等各方面赶上了世界标准。其中，一等胶占了99％。
