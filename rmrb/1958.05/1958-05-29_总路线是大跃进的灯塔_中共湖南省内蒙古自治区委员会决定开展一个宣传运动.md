Xinhua News Agency, May 28th - The CCP Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee has decided to vigorously promote and earnestly study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party.
The Inner Mongolia Party Committee believes that the resolutions and documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress are a summary of China's eight years of socialist construction experience, the general guideline and lighthouse for guiding the current socialist construction undertakings, an ideological weapon against modern revisionism, and an important ideological weapon for the nationwide rectification movement. Therefore, it calls on all Party members of the Inner Mongolia Party organizations to earnestly study and publicize the spirit and essence of these resolution documents, and to implement the spirit of the Congress's resolutions into practical work.
Regarding the method of publicizing and studying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee decided: 1. First, organize cadres, especially responsible Party cadres, to study relevant documents. On May 29th, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee will convene the Seventh Plenary Session of the Committee to study the implementation of the general line of socialist construction, liberate communist thinking, further promote the Great Leap Forward in production and construction and various tasks, and welcome the high tide of the technological and cultural revolutions. In addition, cadres participating in various regional meetings will be organized to listen to the communication of the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and study relevant documents. 2. Mobilize more than a thousand responsible Party and government cadres at the county level and above to go deep into factories, mines, townships, and communes to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, focusing on publicizing the basic points of the general line of socialist construction, promoting the liberation of thinking, and the communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. And, using the general line of socialist construction as a guide, comprehensively examine production and construction and various tasks to improve leadership, study methods, and solve problems. 3. All cadres in the region's government agencies, cultural organizations, and secondary schools and above should immediately arrange for the study of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress; and, on the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the spirit of the documents, combine it with the fourth stage of the rectification movement, connect with reality, raise awareness, and liberate thinking. 4. Designate the Inner Mongolia Broadcasting Station to continuously broadcast important reports of the Congress, and organize a broadcast conference in the near future, inviting representatives from the autonomous region who attended the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress to communicate and explain the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, requiring Party organizations in various places to mobilize about one million cadres, Party member propagandists, and the masses to listen. And organize them to carry out extensive publicity activities after the meeting. 5. Through newspapers and publishing institutions at all levels, a large number of meeting reports and resolutions will be printed in both Mongolian and Chinese. It is required that each cadre and intellectual in the region's government agencies have a copy, and each production team and workshop should have at least one copy of the main report documents. It is estimated that 500,000 copies of study documents will be printed throughout the region. 6. Newspapers above the county level in the region should seriously publish important reports or report summaries of the Congress, and quickly formulate a reporting plan for studying, publicizing, and implementing the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.
This newspaper's Changsha dispatch, May 28th - "Immediately and extensively and deeply publicize and implement the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CCP and the general line of socialist construction among cadres and the broad masses, and transform it into a great driving force for liberating people's minds and promoting current work." This was the decision of the enlarged meeting of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the CCP yesterday afternoon.
The meeting believed that the current international and domestic situation is very good, and agricultural and industrial production are both making a Great Leap Forward, just like the situation in Hunan and other parts of the country. Of course, we must fully anticipate difficulties, such as imagining that this year we will encounter a major flood like the one in 1954, which had not occurred in nearly a century, or a major drought like the one in 1956, which had not occurred in nearly a century. We must not waver in our confidence and determination in the Great Leap Forward. We must exert full effort, strive for the upstream, and conscientiously achieve ten-tenths of the targets, twelve-tenths of the measures, and twenty-four-tenths of the effort. The meeting demanded that we resolutely overcome the style of being superficial rather than deep, coarse rather than meticulous, and showy rather than solid, do our work solidly, and must not have any complacency or relaxation.
The meeting believed that to implement the general line of socialist construction, we must resolutely follow the mass line, maintain close ties with the people at all times, and cadres must appear among the masses with the attitude of ordinary workers, treating people equally. In agriculture, industry, commerce, culture, education, and health, we must be good at inserting red flags, inserting advanced flags, and all regions and all walks of life must actively insert them, and we must go wherever there are people. We must be good at distinguishing the wind direction. Everyone knows when a big wind comes, but it is difficult to distinguish a small wind. Leading cadres should pay special attention to small winds.
The meeting believed that breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, cutting off the tail of slavery, and establishing the noble communist style of daring to think, speak, and act is the fundamental issue in implementing the general line of socialist construction.
The meeting also believed that the leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee for the construction of the general line of socialism. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, it would be impossible to build our country into a great socialist country in a faster, better, and more economical way. We must rectify the Party solidly. Without a party that is sound in politics, ideology, and organization, it is impossible to lead socialist construction well.
Finally, the meeting also particularly emphasized "watching three years in five years, watching the first year in three years." It emphasized that the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the general line of socialist construction should be transformed into a driving force for promoting current ideological liberation and the Great Leap Forward. It demanded that a vigorous propaganda campaign be launched among cadres and the masses throughout the province immediately, and that all localities should communicate, study, inspect, and promote work simultaneously, first of all, current industrial and agricultural production.
After the enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee, the Provincial Committee immediately convened a telephone conference of the secretaries of the prefectural (municipal) and county Party committees that evening to convey the Provincial Committee's decision on extensively and deeply publicizing and implementing the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CCP and the general line of socialist construction.

    总路线是大跃进的灯塔
    中共湖南省内蒙古自治区委员会决定开展一个宣传运动
    新华社28日讯　中共内蒙古自治区委员会决定大力宣传和认真学习党的八大二次会议的文件。
    内蒙古党委认为，八大二次会议的决议文件，是我国八年来社会主义建设经验的总结，是指导当前社会主义建设各项事业的总方针和灯塔，是反对现代修正主义的思想武器，也是全民整风的重要思想武器。因此，号召内蒙古党组织的全体党员认真学习和宣传这些决议文件的精神和实质，并把大会决议的精神贯彻到实际工作中去。
    关于宣传和学习八大二次会议文件的方法问题，内蒙古党委决定：一、首先组织干部，特别是党的负责干部，学习有关文件。本月29日内蒙古党委将召开第七次全体委员会议，研究贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，解放共产主义思想，进一步推动生产建设和各项工作的大跃进，迎接技术革命和文化革命的高潮等问题。此外，并组织参加全区性各种会议的干部听取八大二次会议决议的传达并学习有关文件。二、动员一千多名县以上党政负责干部深入厂、矿、乡、社，传达八大二次会议的精神，着重宣传建设社会主义总路线的基本点，提倡解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。并以社会主义建设总路线为指针，全面检查生产建设和各项工作，以改进领导，研究办法，解决问题。三、全区机关干部、文化团体和中等以上院校，要立即布置八大二次会议文件的学习；并在全面领会文件精神的基础上，结合第四阶段的整风运动，联系实际，提高觉悟，解放思想。四、指定内蒙古广播电台，连续广播大会的重要报告，并在最近期间组织广播大会，邀请自治区出席八大二次会议的代表传达讲解八大二次会议的精神，要求各地党组织动员一百万左右干部、党员宣传员和群众收听。并在会后组织他们进行广泛的宣传活动。五、通过各级报刊出版机关用蒙汉两种文字大量印发会议的报告决议文件。要求全区机关干部知识分子人手一册，主要的报告文件，要求各生产队、车间最少一册。预计全区印发的学习文件，将达五十万份。六、区内县以上报纸，要认真刊登大会重要报告或报告摘要，并迅速制定学习、宣传和贯彻执行八大二次会议决议的报道计划。
    本报长沙28日电　“立即在全省干部和广大群众中广泛而又深入地宣传贯彻中共八大二次会议精神和建设社会主义的总路线，并把它变成为解放人们思想和推动当前各项工作的伟大动力”。这是昨天下午中共湖南省委扩大会议的决定。
    会议认为，当前国际国内的形势很好，农业生产和工业生产都在大跃进，湖南同全国各地的情况一样。当然，我们要充分设想困难，比如设想今年如果又遇到像1954年那样近百年未有的大水灾，或者1956年那样近百年来未有的大旱灾。也不能丝毫动摇我们大跃进的信心和决心。我们一定要鼓足干劲、力争上游，切实做到十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲。会议要求坚决克服浮而不深、粗而不细、华而不实的作风，扎扎实实地做好工作，决不能有半点自满和松懈的情绪。
    会议认为，贯彻执行建设社会主义总路线，必须坚决地走群众路线，时刻跟人民群众保持密切联系，干部一定要以普通劳动者的态度在群众中出现，平等待人。在农业、工业、商业、文化、教育、卫生各个方面都要善于插红旗，插先进旗，各个地区、各行各业都要积极地插，只要有人的地方都要去插。我们一定要善于辨别风向。大风来了，谁都知道，小风就难于辨别，领导干部要特别注意小风。
    会议认为、破除迷信、解放思想、割掉奴性尾巴、树立敢想敢说敢做的共产主义的高尚风格，是贯彻执行建设社会主义总路线的根本问题。
    会议还认为，党的领导是建设社会主义总路线的根本保证。没有共产党的领导，就不可能多快好省地把我国建成为一个伟大的社会主义国家。我们一定要把党扎扎实实地整好。没有一个在政治上、思想上、组织上健全的党，要领导好社会主义建设是不可能的。
    最后，会议还特别强调“五年看三年，三年看头年。”强调把八大二次会议的精神和建设社会主义总路线变成推动当前思想解放和大跃进的动力。要求立即在全省的干部和群众中开展一个声势浩大的宣传运动，各地要做到一边传达、一边学习、一边检查推进工作，首先是当前的工、农业生产。
    省委扩大会议结束后，当日晚上省委连夜召开了全省地（市）县委书记电话会议，传达了省委关于广泛深入宣传贯彻中共八大二次会议精神和建设社会主义总路线的决定。
