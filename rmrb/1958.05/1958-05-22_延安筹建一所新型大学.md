Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an: A new type of university is being planned in Yan'an, the sacred site of the revolution, and will begin enrolling students this summer.

　　This university will enroll a large number of students from worker and peasant backgrounds, focusing on training various technical personnel for the construction of mountainous areas. It is planned to enroll more than 200 students this year, offering two-year diploma courses; in the future, the method of building the school while teaching will be adopted, and within three years it will gradually expand into a comprehensive four-year university capable of accommodating more than 3,000 students.

　　This university is located near Yangjialing, the former site of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The school buildings are built against the mountains, and all are earthen and stone cave dwellings except for the classrooms and auditorium. The various facilities in the school are also as simple and plain as possible.

　　With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the demands of the peasants in northern Shaanxi for culture and technology are becoming increasingly urgent. Agricultural cooperatives in various places have proposed that they want to achieve the goal of having eight personnel in each cooperative within three years: namely, agricultural technicians, agricultural machinery personnel, water conservancy technicians, forestry and horticulture personnel, veterinary prevention and control personnel, health care workers, midwives, and breeding personnel. At the same time, they also demanded to popularize primary school education, eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people, and vigorously develop local industries. The establishment of this university will promote the development of local industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational undertakings.

    延安筹建一所新型大学
    新华社延安讯　革命圣地——延安正在筹建一所新型大学，今年暑期开始招生。
    这所大学将招收大批工农成份的学生，着重培养建设山区的各种技术人材。今年预定招收学生二百多名，开设二年制专科；以后将采取一边上课一边建校的办法，在三年内逐步扩大为可容纳学生三千多人的综合性的四年制大学。
    这所大学设在中共中央故址——杨家岭附近。校舍依山而建，除教室和礼堂外，全部是土窑洞和石窑洞。校内各种设备也力求简单、朴素。
    随着工农业生产大跃进，陕北农民对文化和技术的要求日益迫切。各地农业社提出，要在三年内达到社社有八员：即农业技术员、农业机械员、水利技术员、林业园艺员、兽医防治员、保健员、接生员、配种员。同时，他们还要求普及小学教育，扫除青壮年文盲，大力举办地方工业。这所大学的建立，对当地工农业生产和文化教育事业的发展，都将起促进作用。
