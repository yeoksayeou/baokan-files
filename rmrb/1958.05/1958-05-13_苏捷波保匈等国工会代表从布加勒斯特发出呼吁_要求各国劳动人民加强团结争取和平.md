Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 12th -- According to TASS, trade union representatives from various countries who came to Romania to participate in the "May Day" celebrations held a meeting with trade union activists in Bucharest on the 10th. Participants in the meeting issued a statement calling on working people and all trade union organizations around the world to strengthen concerted action and actively participate in the struggle for peace and the elimination of the threat of a new war.

The meeting was attended by representatives of trade unions from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Democratic Germany, the United Arab Republic, Morocco, Argentina, Britain, Italy, and other countries.

The statement pointed out that the participants in the meeting were disturbed by the aggressive monopoly groups intensifying the arms race, building missile launch sites on the territory of North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, and arming the West German army with rocket weapons and nuclear weapons. The statement expressed a warm welcome for the Soviet Union's decision to unilaterally cease the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The statement said, "Together with world public opinion, we demand that the United States and Britain, which possess atomic and hydrogen weapons, face up to the wishes of the peace-loving people and also cease testing nuclear weapons."

The statement expressed support for the conference of trade union and working people's representatives from European countries, which will be held in Berlin in June this year at the initiative of the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The statement called on the working people and trade union organizations of all countries to step up the struggle to end the colonial war in Algeria and to strive to grant the Algerian people national independence and the right to a free life. The statement also called on the representatives of the World Federation of Trade Unions, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, and the International Federation of Christian Trade Unions to formulate a program of unified action for the working people and trade union organizations of all countries to ensure peace and the security of all countries.
