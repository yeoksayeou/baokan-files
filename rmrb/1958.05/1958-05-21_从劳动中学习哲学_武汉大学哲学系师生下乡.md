Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 19th: The entire faculty and students of the Philosophy Department of Wuhan University, determined to overcome dogmatism and the tendency to divorce from reality, went to Liulin and Yangfu townships in Hong'an County on the 15th to participate in labor and learn Marxist-Leninist philosophy through labor training.

The decision for the philosophy department's teachers and students to go to the countryside for labor was made after more than a month of great debates on teaching reform. For a long time, there has been a tendency towards dogmatism and detachment from reality in the department's teaching. Many teachers, when lecturing on Marxist-Leninist philosophy, merely repeated phrases from classical works, rarely connecting with reality. The phenomenon of emphasizing the past over the present in the curriculum was also serious, and individual teachers even openly spread revisionist ideas in the classroom. Due to these serious problems in teaching, some students' individualistic ideas of only focusing on studies without paying attention to politics grew, and some students even wanted to be only professionally competent without being politically conscious.

Since the in-depth development of the "Double-Anti" movement (Anti-Waste and Anti-Conservatism), the entire faculty and students have launched heated debates on how to run a good Marxist-Leninist philosophy department, criticized various erroneous tendencies in teaching, and unanimously agreed that to teach and learn Marxist-Leninist philosophy well, it is necessary to first solve fundamental issues such as political and ideological standpoints, viewpoints, methods, and the integration of theory with practice. Therefore, it was decided to break the convention that the philosophy department had no production practice, and to go to the countryside to participate in labor and conduct production practice, learn living knowledge, and enrich teaching content.

After the debate, everyone's enthusiasm for participating in labor training was very high. On the eve of going to the countryside, all teachers and students unanimously stated: After going down, we will eat, live, and work with the peasants, take the peasants as teachers, humbly learn production knowledge and class struggle knowledge from the peasants, and systematically conduct some investigations and research and class analysis, and learn to use Marxist-Leninist philosophical theory to summarize the work methods of creating experimental fields in Hong'an County to enrich Marxist-Leninist philosophy.

### 从劳动中学习哲学  武汉大学哲学系师生下乡

    从劳动中学习哲学
    武汉大学哲学系师生下乡
    新华社武汉19日电　武汉大学哲学系全系师生决心克服教条主义和脱离实际的倾向，已于15日前往红安县的柳林、杨甫二乡参加劳动，从劳动锻炼中学习马列主义哲学。
    哲学系师生下乡劳动是经过一个多月的教学改革大辩论后决定的。长期以来，这个系的教学中存在着教条主义和脱离实际的倾向，许多教师在讲授马列主义哲学时，只是搬弄一些经典著作上的词句，很少联系实际，课程内容中厚古薄今现象也较严重，个别教师甚至公开在课堂上散布修正主义思想。由于教学上存在着这些严重问题，部分学生不问政治、埋头读书的个人主义思想有了滋长，有的学生甚至想只专不红。
    双反运动深入开展以后，全系师生针对着如何办好马列主义哲学系的问题展开了热烈的辩论，批判了教学上的各种错误倾向，一致认为要教好和学好马列主义哲学，必须首先解决政治思想上的立场、观点、方法和理论联系实际等根本问题。因此，决定打破哲学系没有生产实习的常规，到农村去参加劳动和进行生产实习，学习活的知识，来丰富教学内容。
    经过辩论，大家对参加劳动锻炼的热情很高。在下乡前夕，全体师生一致表示：下去后和农民同吃同住同劳动，拜农民做老师，虚心向农民学习生产知识和阶级斗争知识，有计划有系统地进行一些调查研究和阶级分析工作，学会运用马列主义哲学理论总结红安县创造试验田的工作方法，来充实马列主义哲学科学。
