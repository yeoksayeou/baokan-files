Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 27th. At the Hubei Province Science Workers Conference, which closed on the 26th, the official establishment of the Hubei Province Science and Technology Commission was announced.

The Hubei Province Science and Technology Commission is the administrative leading body for the management of scientific work under the Hubei Provincial People's Committee. It will conduct unified planning and leadership in aspects such as implementing guidelines and policies in various scientific research departments, formulating and executing scientific research plans, organizing and coordinating scientific research work and research forces, and studying and improving the conditions for scientific work. This is to overcome phenomena such as mutual constraints and independent actions between production and research institutions, departmentalism, and duplication of research subjects leading to the offsetting of efforts.

The conference clarified that the guiding principle of scientific research work in Hubei Province is to serve industrial and agricultural production, with the primary focus on studying and solving current practical problems.

Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, called on scientific workers and technical workers in industrial sectors to liberate their thinking, break down superstitions, boldly innovate, rely on their own efforts, and neither be arrogant nor belittle themselves. He urged them to use the spirit of hard work and diligence, learn from workers, peasants, and folk experts, summarize their creative experiences, and impart their own scientific knowledge to the masses in order to achieve the goal of serving workers and peasants and enriching themselves. Otherwise, there will be no genuine scientific achievements.

The Hubei Province Science and Technology Commission is composed of more than seventy people, including scientists from the Wuhan area, professors from universities and colleges, and heads of various industrial departments of the government. Zhang Tixue, Governor of Hubei Province, serves as the Chairman of the Commission. The Commission has established seventeen professional groups, including electrical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering and construction, water conservancy, aquaculture, and philosophy and social sciences. In order to ensure that scientific research work truly reflects the Party's leadership and closely serves production, the leaders of each professional group are respectively served by directors-general (bureaus) who are familiar with local work conditions and have certain scientific work experience.

    湖北省省长张体学在会上号召科学工作者和产业部门技术工作者解放思想，破除迷信，大胆革新，自力更生，既不妄自尊大也不妄自菲薄，用实干苦干精神，向工农群众、向土专家请教，总结他们的创造经验，并把自己的科学知识传授给群众，才能达到为工农服务和丰富自己的目的。否则就不会有真正的科学成就。
    湖北省科学工作委员会由武汉地区科学家、大专学校教授、政府各产业部门负责人等七十多人组成。湖北省省长张体学任主任委员。委员会分别设立电机、化工、土木建筑、水利、水产、哲学社会科学等十七个专业组。为了达到科学研究工作切实体现党的领导、紧密为生产服务的目的，各专业组的组长分别由熟悉地方工作情况和具有一定科学工作经验的厅（局）长担任。
