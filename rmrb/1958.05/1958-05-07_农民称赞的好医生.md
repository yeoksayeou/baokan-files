    A Good Doctor Praised by Farmers
    "He comes whenever called, without any airs. He is truly a good doctor sent by Chairman Mao." This is how the farmers around Wufengling in the Damaoshan area, within a radius of twenty or thirty li, praise the doctors and nurses who have been sent down to the Wufengdong branch of the Damaoshan Forestry, Animal Husbandry and Agricultural Comprehensive Reclamation Farm to participate in labor.
    Doctors Yang and Tang, and Nurse Zhang, who were sent down here, took turns making house calls more than ten times in three and a half months, treating a total of fifty-six patients. Thanks to their publicity and education, the farmers have begun to pay attention to environmental sanitation. Zheng Junlan, a 69-year-old farmer in Jianyang Village, suffered from a severe stomach ailment and fainted from the pain. By the time Dr. Tang crossed two mountains, a distance of ten li each, to reach him, the old man was lying in bed with only a faint breath. The whole family was in tears and had even placed the coffin for his burial in the hall. But after more than two hours of emergency treatment by Dr. Tang and several follow-up visits, he finally recovered his health. From then on, the old man would say to everyone he met, "This life of mine was snatched back from the King of Hell by the young doctor who came down from Wufengdong. The doctor educated by Chairman Mao is more effective than any immortal!" The one-and-a-half-year-old daughter of Tong Wenbiao from Huangshitian Village suffered from bronchial pneumonia and had a high fever of 40.8 degrees Celsius. She was having trouble breathing before they asked Dr. Yang to come for treatment. Dr. Yang braved the heavy rain and cold to get there. Disregarding his soaking wet clothes and the cold, he quickly and calmly began his medical work. After some emergency treatment, the child slowly began to breathe evenly and woke up, gradually feeling hungry and crying. The child's parents expressed their great gratitude to Dr. Yang for his spirit of rescuing the dying and healing the wounded.

    农民称赞的好医生
    “随喊随到，没有一点架子，真是毛主席派来的好医生。”这是大茅山区乌风岭下周围二、三十里地的农民对下放到大茅山林牧农综合垦殖场乌风洞分场来劳动的几位医生和护士的赞扬。
    下放在这里的杨医生、汤医生和张护士，在三个半月的时间里，轮流出诊十几次，共医好病人五十六名，由于他们的宣传教育，农民已开始注意环境卫生了。建阳村有一位六十九岁的郑君兰老农民，患了严重的胃病，痛的昏过去了，等到汤医生翻过两个十里路的大山到达后，老头倒在床上只有一点点气息了，全家人便哭成了一团，连安葬的棺材都放在堂前。但经过汤医生两个多小时的急救和接连几次去复诊，终于使他恢复了健康，老头以后逢人便说：“我这条命是从乌风洞下来的年青医生从阎王手里夺回来的，毛主席教育出来的医生比什么神仙都还灵验。”黄石田村童文标的一岁半的小女孩，患支气管肺炎，发高烧到了40.8度，气都喘不过来了，才来请杨医生去医治，杨医生冒着大雨和严寒赶去。顾不得衣衫湿淋淋的，也不觉得身上寒冷，就迅速而镇静地开始了医疗工作。经过一番急救后，小孩才慢慢地呼吸均匀而苏醒了，并逐渐地感到肚子饿了，哇哇地啼哭。孩子的父母对杨医生这种救死扶伤的精神，表示非常感激。
