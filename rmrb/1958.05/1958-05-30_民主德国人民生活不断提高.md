The government of the German Democratic Republic has taken new measures to improve the people's livelihood, such as abolishing the remnants of the food rationing system and reducing prices. This is a manifestation of the superiority of the socialist system.

In the short nine years since the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, thanks to the victorious completion of the first Five-Year Plan (1951-1955) and the effective implementation of the second Five-Year Plan (1956-1960), its total industrial output has more than doubled. In the first quarter of this year alone, industrial production increased by more than 10% compared with the same period last year. On the basis of production development, the material and cultural living standards of the working people of the German Democratic Republic are also continuously improving.

During the first Five-Year Plan, the national income of the German Democratic Republic increased to 162%. At the same time, by 1956, a total of seventeen price reductions had been carried out. Since 1950, the average price of various commodities in the German Democratic Republic has decreased by 38%, and the cost of living has decreased by 33%.

With the continuous improvement of the material life of the working people, the retail trade volume in 1957 reached 34.8 billion marks, an increase of 2.2 billion marks compared with 1956. By the end of last year, the total amount of bank deposits of the working people of the German Democratic Republic had reached 9.5 billion marks, averaging 500 marks per person.

In addition, starting last year, the government of the German Democratic Republic also decided to begin implementing a 45-hour work week in several enterprises. (East)

    民主德国人民生活不断提高
    德意志民主共和国政府为提高人民生活，又一次采取了新的措施，废除食品配给制残迹和减低物价等。这是社会主义制度优越性的表现。
    在德意志民主共和国成立的短短九年里，由于第一个五年计划（1951年—1955年）的胜利完成和第二个五年计划（1956年—1960年）的有效执行，它的工业总产量已经增加了一倍多。仅今年第一季度工业生产就比去年同一时期增加10％以上。在生产发展的基础上，民主德国劳动人民的物质和文化生活水平也不断提高。
    民主德国的国民收入，在第一个五年计划期间，共增加到162％。同时，到1956年为止，还共进行了十七次的减低物价。自从1950年来，民主德国各种商品的价格平均降低了38％，生活费用降低了33％。
    随着劳动人民物质生活的不断改善，1957年的零售贸易额已达三百四十八亿马克，比1956年增加二十二亿马克。到去年年底为止，民主德国劳动人民的银行存款总额已达到九十五亿马克，按人口平均计算每人达到五百马克。
    此外，从去年开始，民主德国政府还决定在若干企业里开始实行四十五小时工作周。　（东）
