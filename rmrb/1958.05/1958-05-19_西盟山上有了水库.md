　　There is now a reservoir on Ximeng Mountain
　　The first reservoir in history has been built in the area inhabited by the Ximeng Kawa ethnic group.

　　This reservoir on Kawa Mountain is built on a mountain top more than 2,000 meters above sea level. It uses a stream in a depression surrounded by peaks to build a reservoir. With this reservoir, 600 to 700 mu of terraced fields can be cultivated, and fish can also be raised. Kawa and Lahu ethnic group public figures and farmers who came to visit the construction site were both surprised and moved, saying: If it weren't for the Communist Party! Who could do such a thing for us!

　　During the construction, technicians and stonemasons were sent from the interior of the motherland, and local government cadres, led by the secretary of the Working Committee, came to help the Kawa people with voluntary labor. Batches of Kawa farmers who were repairing the reservoir learned techniques such as blasting and stonework. The best of them have been absorbed as district and township water conservancy instructors.

    西盟山上有了水库
    西盟佧佤族聚居地区有了历史上第一个水库。
    这个佧佤山上的水库，建立在西盟山海拔二千多公尺的山头上。利用山峰环抱的洼地里的一股溪水筑起一座水库。有了这个水库，可垦六、七百亩梯田，还可养鱼。到工地来参观的佧佤族和拉祜族公众领袖人物和农民群众，都又惊异又感动地说：要不是共产党呀！有谁能给我们做这样的事情！
    施工中，祖国内地派来了技术员和石工，当地的机关干部由工委书记亲自率领，来帮助佧佤人作义务劳动。修水库的佧佤农民，一批又一批地学会了爆破，石方等技术。他们当中优秀的已吸收做区乡水利辅导员。
