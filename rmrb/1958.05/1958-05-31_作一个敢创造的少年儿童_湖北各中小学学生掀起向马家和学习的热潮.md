Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 30th: Students in primary and secondary schools in Hubei Province are launching a surge to learn from the young model Ma Jiahe. Many children have proposed to study diligently, work hard, and boldly delve into technology, striving to be Ma Jiahe-style young pioneers.

Ma Jiahe is a young special-class labor model from Wuchang County, only fourteen years old this year. Last winter, during his winter vacation, when he participated in the construction of the Santan Yinyue Reservoir in Wuchang County, he saw that the workers were all using shoulder poles to carry earth, which was inefficient and labor-intensive. He remembered seeing people using pushcarts to transport things in Zhifang Town a few years ago, and decided to try to make a handcart to transport earth.

In his spare time, he collected some materials to install and test, and consulted with experienced farmers. After more than thirty repeated experiments, he finally made a light and durable "little dog head cart." This "little dog head cart" could push 200 catties of earth at a time, increasing work efficiency by three to four times compared to shoulder carrying. After this advanced experience was supported and promoted by the Wuchang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, a large-scale tool reform movement emerged on the construction site. Within a few days, the workers created hundreds of various forms of earth-moving vehicles, increasing work efficiency by more than three times, shortening the construction period of the reservoir by twenty-five days, and saving the country more than 18,400 yuan. Ma Jiahe's exemplary actions of bold innovation and creation have been widely praised by the people. The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League recently issued a call to organize all young pioneers and middle school students in the province to learn from Ma Jiahe, which has been warmly responded to by the vast number of young people in the province.

    作一个敢创造的少年儿童
    湖北各中小学学生掀起向马家和学习的热潮
    新华社武汉30日电　湖北省各中小学学生正在掀起一个向少年模范马家和学习的热潮。许多儿童提出要努力学习，刻苦劳动，大胆钻研技术，争取作一个马家和式的少年儿童。
    马家和是武昌县的少年特等劳动模范，今年才十四岁。去年冬天他利用寒假参加兴修武昌县三潭印月大水库时，看到民工们全部用担子挑土，工作效率很低，劳动强度大；他想起几年前在纸坊镇看到有人用推车运东西的事情，就决定试制一个手推车，用车子来运土。
    他在工余时间一面收集一些材料来安装试验，一面向老农请教，经过三十多次的反复试验，终于制成了一个轻便耐用的小狗头车。这种小狗头车一次就能推土二百斤，比肩担提高工效三、四倍。这一先进经验经中共武昌县委的支持和推广后，在工地上就出现了一个大规模的工具改革运动，几天内就由民工们创造了几百部各种形式的运土车，提高工效三倍多，使水库工程的工期缩短了二十五天，并为国家节约了一万八千四百多元。马家和这种大胆革新创造的模范行动，受到了人们的普遍赞扬。共青团湖北省委最近发出关于组织全省少年和中学生学习马家和的号召，得到了全省广大少年的热烈响应。
