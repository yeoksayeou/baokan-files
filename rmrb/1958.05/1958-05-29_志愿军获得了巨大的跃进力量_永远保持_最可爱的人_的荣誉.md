Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 28th. The general line for socialist construction formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has brought great encouragement to the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) stationed in Korea.

　　In recent days, many officers and soldiers, after hearing the news of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress on the radio, have stayed up past noon, gathering at military post offices and other places to read newspapers. On the 26th, officers and soldiers of a certain unit's artillery battalion, who were undergoing labor and defense system tests on the playground, stopped the tests to read the newspapers as soon as they arrived. Many units also organized seminars and discussions. In the discussions, people expressed that the Party's general line for socialist construction is a beacon illuminating the way forward for all tasks, and they are determined to exert their utmost efforts, resolutely implement the spirit of the general line, and do a good job in the withdrawal and other tasks. Zhou Fangbao, a second-class meritorious worker and technical expert, was particularly excited about the great call for technological and cultural revolutions put forward by the congress. He said, "I will take immediate action to learn from the spirit of the great leap forward of the people of the motherland and strive to be a 'Five-Good' pacesetter." Peng Dabing, a second-class model, said, "We are about to withdraw to the motherland. After returning home, I will strive to go to the most difficult and most needed places in the motherland and forever maintain the honor of 'The Most Beloved People.' If I am sent to the agricultural front, I am determined to be Li Shunda; if I am sent to the industrial front, I will be Wang Chonglun."

　　The general line has brought tremendous leap forward strength to the vast number of officers and soldiers of the CPV. The CPV troops stationed on the islands have become more vigilant in strengthening patrols and guards to prevent enemy provocations and sabotage activities. At the Dingzhou Reservoir construction site, CPV officers and soldiers are helping the Korean people carry out peaceful construction in the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical results. Their slogan is: "Carry more, pull more, push more; shed one more drop of sweat, leave behind one more point of friendship." Originally, two people used railway carts to transport ten cubic meters of earth per day, but after hearing the general line, they increased it to sixteen cubic meters at once. Originally, each person carried 1.5 cubic meters of loess from a distance of 150 meters to the construction site every day, but not long ago, it increased to four cubic meters, and recently it has leaped to six cubic meters.

    志愿军获得了巨大的跃进力量
    永远保持“最可爱的人”的荣誉
    新华社平壤28日电　中共八大二次会议制定的社会主义建设总路线，给远在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军官兵带来了极大的鼓舞。
    连日来，许多官兵从广播中听到八大二次会议的消息后，不睡午睡，聚集在军邮站等报纸看。26日，正在操场上进行劳卫制测验的某部战炮营官兵，报纸一到就停止测验进行读报。许多部队并且组织了座谈和讨论。在座谈中，人们纷纷表示，党的社会主义建设总路线是照耀各项工作前进的灯塔，决心鼓足干劲，坚决贯彻总路线的精神，做好撤军和其它各项工作。二等功臣、技术能手周芳保对于大会提出的技术革命和文化革命的伟大号召特别感到兴奋。他说，我要马上行动起来，学习祖国人民大跃进的精神，争取做“五好”标兵。二级模范彭大炳表示，我们就要撤回祖国了。回国后，我要争取到祖国最艰苦最需要的地方去，并且永远保持“最可爱的人”的荣誉。如派我到农业战线，我就决心做李顺达，如派我去工业战线，我就要做王崇伦。
    总路线给志愿军广大官兵带来了巨大的跃进力量。驻海岛的志愿军部队更加警惕地加强了巡逻、警戒，防止敌人的挑衅破坏活动。在定州水库工地上，志愿军官兵是以多快好省的精神帮助朝鲜人民进行和平建设。他们的口号是：“多背多拉多推，多流一滴汗，多留下一分友谊”。原来两个人一天用铁轨运土车推土十立方公尺，听到总路线后一下子提高到十六立方公尺。原来从一百五十公尺距离抬黄土到施工地点每人每天抬一点五立方公尺，不久前提高到四立方公尺，近日又跃进到了六立方公尺。
