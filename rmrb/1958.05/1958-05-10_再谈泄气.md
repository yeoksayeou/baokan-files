    More on Discouragement
    Méi ěr
    Some time ago, I wrote an article entitled "On Discouragement." Now it seems that this article only wrote about one aspect, and did not talk about the other aspect - the attitude of the led.
    The led also have two completely different attitudes towards each task: one is to break through various obstacles with full vigor and strive to complete various tasks, regardless of whether the leader is encouraging or discouraging them. The People's Daily on May 4th reported such a thing: Xu Zuying, an ordinary electroplating worker at the Shanghai Huafu Gold Pen Factory, proposed last year to reduce the gold content in the Hero pen case. However, the factory's technicians told him: "It's impossible, there is no such theoretical basis in Chinese and foreign books." The night school teacher also said that he only had a junior high school education and lacked basic knowledge to study these issues. Xu Zuying refused to give up, and experimented with batching worker Gu Zhenhua. After more than 30 consecutive experiments, they finally succeeded. The Huafu Gold Pen Factory alone can save 400 taels of gold a year. The Zhejiang Daily on April 23 also reported an incident: Cai Maofu, an advanced worker at the Hangzhou Cement Factory, suggested to the leadership to adopt the advanced experience of the "rapid kiln firing method" in order to increase cement production. As soon as this suggestion was put forward, many people opposed it. However, Cai Maofu was not discouraged and continued to insist on his opinion. With his repeated insistence, the factory finally tried to promote it. As a result, the daily output of the large kiln suddenly increased to 35 tons.
    As staff members and working people of a socialist country, we should have such a style: dare to think what others dare not think; dare to do what others dare not do; if you say I can't do it, I must do it; if you say I can't do it well, I must do it well. Why should we do this? Because we have no selfishness, only the heart to serve the socialist construction cause, and the heart to serve the people. With this heart, there is nothing we dare not think, nothing we dare not say, nothing we dare not do, and nothing we dare not insist on. Even if practice proves that the original ideas, statements, and practices are not completely correct, we can bravely correct our mistakes. Also, because our method is correct, not starting from subjective wishes, but from reality, seeking truth from facts, what we think, say, and do all have a certain factual basis. When we find that our own ideas, statements, and practices are not completely in line with objective reality, we can also correct them according to objective reality.
    Righteous insistence on one's own opinion is completely different from making trouble without reason. Righteous insistence on one's own opinion is to uphold the truth. Making trouble without reason is to insist even though one has no reason or although one has some reason but has been refuted. This is stubbornness and making trouble without reason, not upholding the truth.
    Some people will say: Who knows if what one thinks is the truth? Whether it is the truth, of course, needs to be confirmed by practice. But as long as it comes from practice, not from fantasy, then what one thinks will contain a little bit of truth.
    Others are completely opposite to this. Obviously, their own ideas and practices have not been proven wrong by practice, but because someone said something unpleasant, they neither carefully consider the opinions of others, nor necessarily agree with the opinions of others, and immediately abandon their own views. Why are these people so afraid to insist on their own views? There are only two reasons: one is that the opinions they put forward have not been repeatedly considered, or there is not enough material, so they dare not insist; the other is that they are mixed with individualistic elements, afraid that insisting on their own opinions will make it difficult to get along with others, especially with the leadership, in the future, and so on.
    Failing to insist when one should insist is clearly not the style of a revolutionary, but a bad habit. People with this habit are like puppets in a puppet troupe. If others tell him to raise his hand, he will not raise his leg. If others tell him to retreat, he will not move forward... Such people will only have a corrosive effect on our revolutionary ranks. Therefore, we advocate the former style and oppose the latter habit.

    再谈泄气
    梅耳
    前一个时期，写了一篇题为“谈泄气”的文章。现在看来，这篇文章只是写了一个方面，另一个方面——被领导者的态度没有谈。
    被领导者对于每项工作，同样有着两种完全不同的态度：一种是不管领导者是给自己鼓气还是给自己泄气，总是干劲十足地冲破各种障碍，努力完成各项任务。5月4日的人民日报就报道了这样一件事：上海华孚金笔厂普通电镀工徐祖英，去年就提出想把英雄笔套镀金成分用量减少。可是厂里的技术人员告诉他：“不行的，中外书本上都没有这种理论根据”。夜校教师也说他只有初中程度，研究这些问题还缺乏基础知识。徐祖英不服气，和配料工顾振华一起试验，连续试验了三十多次，最后终于成功。单华孚金笔厂一年就可以节约黄金四百两。4月23日的浙江日报也报道了一件事情：杭州水泥厂的先进工人蔡茂福，为了提高水泥产量，曾经建议领导上采用“快速烧窑法”的先进经验。这个建议一提出来，好多人反对。可是蔡茂福并不泄气，继续坚持自己的意见。在他再三坚持下，厂里终于试着推广。结果大窑的日产量一下子提高到三十五吨。
    作为一个社会主义国家的工作人员和劳动人民，就应当有这样的风格：别人不敢想的，自己敢想；别人不敢做的，自己敢做；你说我作不了，我非要作了；你说我作不好，我非要作好。为什么应当这样呢？就因为我们没有任何私心，只有为社会主义建设事业服务的心，为人民服务的心。有了这颗心，没有什么不敢想的，没有什么不敢说的，没有什么不敢作的，也没有什么不敢坚持的。即使在实践中证明了原来的想法说法作法不完全正确，也能勇敢地改正错误。又因为我们的方法是正确的，不是从主观愿望出发，而是从实际出发，实事求是，所想所说所作的，都有一定的事实根据。在发现自己的想法说法作法有不完全符合客观实际时，也能根据客观实际情况加以改正。
    正当的坚持自己意见，和无理取闹是截然不同的。正当的坚持自己意见是坚持真理。无理取闹是明明自己没有理由或者虽然有点理由但已被人驳倒，却还要坚持。这是固执己见，无理取闹，不是坚持真理。
    有人会说：谁知道自己想的是不是真理？是不是真理，当然需要从实践中去证实。但是只要是从实践中来的，不是空想中来的，那自己想的里边多少会包含着一点真理。
    另一种人则与此完全相反，明明自己的想法和作法还没有从实践中证实是错误的，可是因为别人说了句不是的话，他既没有很好地考虑别人的意见，也不一定同意别人的意见，就立即放弃了自己的主张。这些人为什么这样不敢坚持自己的主张呢？不外有两种原因：一是自己所提出的意见还没有经过反复思考，或者还没有充足材料，因而不敢坚持；二是夹杂着个人主义的成分，怕坚持了自己的意见后同别人、特别是同领导上今后不好共事等等。
    应当坚持而不坚持，这显然不是革命者的风格，而是一种不好的习气。有了这种习气的人，就好像木偶剧团里的木偶，别人叫他举手，他不会抬腿，别人叫他后退，他不会向前……。这样的人，对于我们革命队伍只会起腐蚀作用。因此，我们提倡前一种风格，反对后一种习气。
