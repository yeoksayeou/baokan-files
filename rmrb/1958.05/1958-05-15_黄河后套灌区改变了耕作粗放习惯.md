　　Yellow River Houtao Irrigation District Changes Extensive Farming Habits
　　(Our reporter Zhao Yongxi) The farmers in the Yellow River Houtao Irrigation District of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have fundamentally changed their past extensive farming practices during the Great Leap Forward in production. According to statistics from relevant departments, over 83% of the nearly one million mu of spring wheat was sown using new-style animal-powered seeders, an increase of more than six times compared to last year. Moreover, all of it was planted using flat sowing and close planting methods, with cross-pattern close planting accounting for 23.6%. Last year, the area of wheat fields fertilized with manure accounted for only about 50%, but this year all of it was fertilized with manure, averaging 13.5 cartloads per mu (500 jin per cart), and 526 tons of chemical fertilizers were applied for the first time. During sowing, most farmers used modified ten-row disc fertilizer seeders to apply fertilizer mixed with seeds in a concentrated manner. They widely adopted improved varieties suitable for local planting, such as "Gansu No. 96" and "Baiyu Wheat." Except for a few overly wet wheat fields unsuitable for seed dressing with pesticides, all seeds were treated with pesticides to prevent locust damage. Germination tests were generally conducted before sowing.

    The Yellow River Houtao Irrigation District has good water conservancy conditions and fertile land, but there is a large area of land and a small population, with an average of more than ten mu of land per person in the entire area. In the past, farmers only needed to sow more than 20 jin of seeds per mu, cover it with a dozen cartloads of fertile soil, and without applying manure, in the counties of Wuyuan, Anbei, and the Darhan Muminggan United Banner even applied very little fertile soil, they simply watered it a few times, and each mu would yield 100 to 200 jin of grain in the autumn. Therefore, the farming here has always been very extensive. During the Great Leap Forward in production last winter and this spring, the 400,000 farmers in the entire irrigation district were determined to strive to reach a yield of 400 jin per mu in the entire irrigation district in 1958, doubling the output. At this time, the entire area generally faced the difficulty of insufficient labor. Farmers all felt the importance of changing the extensive farming situation, so they purchased and used a large number of new-style animal-powered farm tools with higher operating efficiency, and mobilized more than 80% of women to participate in production. The terrain here is flat and there are many livestock, making it very suitable for farming with new-style animal-powered farm tools. Now, the entire irrigation district has 2,667 animal-powered seeders, an increase of 1.3 times compared to last year, and 1,272 disc harrows. The traditional "two oxen pulling a plow" wooden plows are rarely seen. Double-wheeled double-shared plows, harvesters, and new-style walking plows will also be greatly increased.

### 黄河后套灌区改变了耕作粗放习惯

　　黄河后套灌区改变了耕作粗放习惯
    本报讯　记者赵永西报道：内蒙古自治区黄河后套灌区农民在生产大跃进中，根本改变了过去耕作粗放的情况。据有关部门统计，近百万亩春小麦，有83％以上是用新式畜力播种机播种的，机播面积比去年增加六倍多，而且全部实行了平播密植，其中十字交叉密植占23.6％。去年麦田施粪肥面积只占50％左右，今年全部施了粪肥，平均每亩达十三车半（每车五百斤），并且第一次施用了化学肥料五百二十六吨。播种时，大部分都用改装的十行圆盘施肥播种机将肥料拌在种子里集中施用。普遍采用了“甘肃96号”、“白玉麦”等适合本地种植的良种，除少数过湿的麦田不宜用药剂拌种外，全部进行了药剂拌种来防止蝗虫害。在播种前一般都经过发芽试验。
    黄河后套灌区水利条件好，土地肥沃，但地多人少，全区平均每人占有地十亩以上。农民过去只要每亩播下二十多斤种子，压上十几车肥土，不施粪肥。五原、安北、达拉特后旗甚至连肥土也很少施，到时候浇几遍水，秋后每亩准能收一百到二百来斤粮食。所以，这里耕作一直很粗放。在去冬今春生产大跃进中，全灌区四十万农民决心争取在1958年使全灌区达到亩产四百斤，把产量提高一倍。这时全区普遍发生劳力不足的困难，农民都感到改变耕作粗放情况的重要，就大量购置使用耕作效率较高的新式畜力农具，并且发动80％以上的妇女参加了生产。这里地势平坦，牲畜较多，很适宜用新式畜力农具进行耕作。现在全灌区拥有畜力播种机二千六百六十七台，比去年增加一点三倍，圆盘耙一千二百七十二台。用祖传的“二牛抬杠”木犁进行耕作的，已经很少见了。双轮双铧犁、收割机、新式步犁也将大大增加。
