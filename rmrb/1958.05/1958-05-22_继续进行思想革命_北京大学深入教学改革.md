    Continuing the Ideological Revolution
    Peking University Deepens Teaching Reform
    (Our dispatch) "Thoroughly implement the general line of socialist construction, continue the ideological revolution, deepen teaching reform, and make a great leap forward towards a new communist Peking University." This is the new slogan put forward by the teachers and students of Peking University at the "Oath-Taking Rally for Continuing the Ideological Revolution and Deepening Teaching Reform" held on May 17. Peking University's "Double-Anti" movement has entered a new stage of comprehensive rectification and major reform of teaching.
    Since the "Red and Expert" great debate began at Peking University on April 2, significant gains have been made. The vast majority of people have been able to distinguish the boundaries of the two paths for intellectuals, establish the "Red and Expert" direction, and initially formulate "Red and Expert" plans. However, everyone also recognizes that these gains are far from meeting the requirements of the times and are still lagging behind the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. Therefore, everyone consciously demands that the ideological revolution be carried through to the end, setting off a profound teaching reform.
    At the oath-taking rally on May 17, Ma Shi'an, Third Secretary of the Peking University Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Vice President, pointed out: This teaching reform focuses on resolving the contradiction between bourgeois ideology and proletarian ideology in teaching and scientific research. This is also a struggle between two roads, and in its nature, this struggle is class struggle. However, this contradiction is a problem of ideological understanding. Therefore, this struggle is still an ideological struggle within the people, a revolution of the people's own thinking, and a continuation and deepening of the previous stage of the ideological revolution. He said that in the struggle between two roads, there is also a struggle between two methods. This method is essentially a struggle between two roads. In addition, there is also a struggle between two methods that does not belong to the scope of this class struggle, namely, the vigorous, rapid, good, and economical method versus the cold, slow, poor, and wasteful method.
    Ma Shi'an talked about the requirements and methods of teaching reform. He said that first of all, one must understand the general line of socialist construction ideologically and implement it in work, and draw a clear line between the two roads in educational and academic thought. One must recognize what is an advanced method and what is a backward method in the two methods. Anything that can be improved should be done immediately.
    Ma Shi'an finally encouraged everyone to recognize the situation, emancipate their minds, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to use the critical and revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism to boldly expose problems and put forward opinions, and then launch a great debate on major issues to build Peking University into a communist university.
    Next, speeches were made at the meeting. Many professors and students reported on their gains in the movement and expressed their determination to continue the ideological revolution. Professor Jian Bozan, Director of the History Department, examined his bourgeois ideology at the meeting and resolved to eliminate the non-proletarian ideology existing in himself and in the History Department of Peking University, so that history can serve the class struggle, the socialist cause, patriotism, internationalism, and world peace. Professor Huang Kun of the Physics Department examined his views of "science for science's sake" and emphasizing profound theory. He said that this actually blurred the view of serving production, and he must correct it in the future. Professor Wang Li of the Chinese Department criticized his erroneous political stance. He said: "The 'Double-Anti' movement is a great movement to save people." Professor Li Funing of the Western Languages Department criticized his past thinking of being detached from politics and "science for science's sake." He said that this kind of thinking is essentially a bourgeois ideology of "pursuing fame and fortune and higher reputation and status."
    All the teachers and students expressed their support for the Party Committee's instructions for the next stage of work and their determination to continue the ideological revolution and devote themselves to teaching reform with vigorous fighting spirit.

    继续进行思想革命
    北京大学深入教学改革
    本报讯　“贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线，继续思想革命，深入教学改革，向共产主义新北大跃进”，这是北京大学师生在5月17日举行的“继续思想革命，深入教学改革誓师大会”上提出的新口号。北大的“双反”运动进入了教学大整大改的新阶段。
    北京大学自4月2日开始“红专”大辩论以来，收获很大。绝大多数人都能划清知识分子两条道路的界限，树立了“红专”方向，初步制定了红专规划。但大家也认识到这些收获还远不能符合时代的要求，比起工农业生产大跃进还是很落后的。因此大家自觉地要求把思想革命进行到底，掀起一个深刻的教学改革。
    在5月17日的誓师大会上，中共北京大学委员会第三书记、副校长马适安指出：这次教学改革着重从教学工作与科学研究中解决资产阶级思想与无产阶级思想的矛盾，这也是两条道路的斗争，这斗争就其性质说是阶级斗争，但这矛盾是思想认识上的问题，因而，这斗争还是人民内部思想上的斗争，是人民自己思想上的革命，是上一阶段思想革命的继续与深入。他说，在两条道路的斗争中，还有两种方法的斗争，这方法就其本质说是两条道路的斗争，此外，还有不属于这阶级斗争范围的两种方法的斗争，即轰轰烈烈的多快好省的方法与冷冷清清的少慢差费的方法的斗争。
    马适安谈到教学改革的要求与方法。他说，首先思想上要懂得社会主义建设的总路线，并在工作中贯彻执行，要在教育思想与学术思想上划清两条道路的界线。要在两种方法上认清什么是先进的方法，什么是落后的方法。凡是能改进的工作，应立即去办。
    马适安最后勉励大家要认清形势，解放思想，敢想、敢说、敢做，敢于用马列主义的批判的、革命的精神，大胆揭发问题，提出意见，然后对重大问题展开大争大辩，把北大建设成为共产主义的大学。
    接着，大会发言。许多教授和学生报告了自己在运动中的收获，并表示了继续思想革命的决心，历史系主任翦伯赞教授在会上检查了自己的资产阶级思想，并下决心清除存在自己身上和北大历史系里的非无产阶级思想。让历史学为阶级斗争服务，为社会主义事业服务，为爱国主义、国际主义和世界和平服务。物理系黄昆教授检查了自己的“为科学而科学”和强调高深理论的观点，他说，这样实际上模糊了为生产服务的观点，今后一定要改正。中文系王力教授批判了自己的错误政治立场，他说：“双反”运动是伟大的救人运动。西语系李赋宁教授批判了自己过去的脱离政治和“为科学而科学”的思想，他说，这种思想实质上是“为了成大名，有更高的声誉和地位”的资产阶级思想。
    所有的教师学生都表示拥护党委下一阶段工作的指示，继续思想革命，以旺盛的斗志投入教学改革。
