Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th. Fedorov, a member of the Soviet Union's International Geophysical Year Committee, said that the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite is the size of a small car, and the various instruments equipped in it are more complete than the second satellite. Its exploration program is much wider than that of American satellites. The Soviet Union's new satellite not only has all the instruments on American satellites, but also many more.

The new satellite will exist longer than the Soviet Union's second artificial satellite, and the working time of scientific instruments will also be longer than the second one. The electricity for all the instruments is supplied by chemical power sources and solar cells. This kind of solar cell will become the basic energy source for interstellar flight in the future.

Professor Fedorov announced these facts at a press conference held by the Soviet State Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries on the 16th.

He said that the new satellite is very heavy, and its successful launch is another great advancement in rocket technology. It was launched successfully the first time, without any failures. The new satellite was launched using chemical fuels and multi-stage rockets. Atomic fuel was not used. According to the materials received so far, the instruments on the satellite are working normally.

Because this satellite is equipped with a powerful radio transmitter, signals can be received in all countries of the world. At present, the Soviet Union's observation station network has expanded. The number of observation stations has increased by one-third compared to the launch of the second satellite. In addition, photographic stations have also been added. A large number of observatories, observation stations, and scientists in various countries are also observing the new satellite.

Fedorov said that the new satellite is mainly for the study of geophysical and cosmic phenomena, and does not include the study of biological phenomena, so no animals were placed on the new satellite. However, research with animals will continue in the future.

When talking about the prospect of the satellite returning to Earth, Fedorov explained that this problem can be solved in principle, but has not yet been practically solved. Fedorov said that the task of flying to the moon is very arduous and requires a lot more effort. It can be considered that the size of the new satellite is about the same as the satellites that may permanently operate in the sky in the future.

### 苏联新卫星真优越  考察范围比美国卫星广泛得多  装载的仪器也比美国的多得多

　　苏联新卫星真优越
    考察范围比美国卫星广泛得多
    装载的仪器也比美国的多得多
    新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联国际地球物理年委员会委员费多罗夫说，苏联第三个人造卫星的大小相当于一个小轿车，其中装备的各种仪器比第二个卫星更加完善。它的考察计划要比美国卫星广泛得多。美国卫星上所有的仪器，苏联新卫星上不仅全有，而且还多得多。
    新卫星存在的时间将比苏联第二个人造卫星长，科学仪器工作时间也比第二个长。全部仪器的用电是由化学电源装置和太阳能电池供给的。这种太阳能电池今后将成为星际飞行中的基本能源。
    费多罗夫教授是16日在苏联国家对外文化委员会举行的记者招待会上宣布这些情况的。
    他说，新卫星重量很大，它的发射成功是火箭技术的又一巨大进步。它一发射就成功，没有遭到过失败。新卫星是用化学燃料和多级火箭发射的。没有采用原子燃料。根据目前收到的材料证明，卫星上的仪器的工作是正常的。
    由于这个卫星上装有强大的无线电发射机，所以世界各国都可以收到讯号。目前苏联观测站网扩大了。观测站比第二个卫星发射时增加了三分之一。此外还增加了摄影站。各国大量的观象台、观测站和科学家也都在观察新卫星。
    费多罗夫说，新卫星主要是为了对地球物理现象和宇宙现象进行研究，不包括生物现象的研究，因此新卫星上没有放上动物。但是今后将继续进行带动物的研究。
    在谈到卫星返回地球的前景时，费多罗夫解释说，这个问题原则上是可以解决的，但是暂时还没有得到实际解决。费多罗夫说，飞到月球上的任务是很艰巨的，还需要做很多努力。可以认为，新卫星的大小同将来可能出现的在天空永久运行的卫星已经差不多了。
