　　Comprehensively Grasp Industry, Drive All Work
　　Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee Forms Ten-Thousand-Person Inspection Team
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 10th – The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formed a ten-thousand-person inspection team, deciding to spend one and a half months focusing on inspecting industrial production, while also inspecting work in finance and trade, culture and education, transportation, and postal communications. The Provincial Party Committee requires that, through this large-scale inspection, the current problems and situations in industry be clarified, the experiences of industrial construction be summarized, and a great leap forward in industrial production be rapidly promoted; through this inspection, the strength of all sectors should be further mobilized to support the great leap forward in agricultural production.
    The inspection team is composed of forces from the province, special districts, counties, and grassroots units, with a total of more than 10,000 cadres; at the same time, some members of the masses are also participating. The Provincial Party Committee believes that this kind of inspection team, which combines top and bottom, and leaders and masses, is an effective method for grasping industry at present. It can enable the Provincial Party Committee to comprehensively grasp industry in a relatively short period of time, and at the same time drive the work of all aspects and promote an all-round leap forward.
    A characteristic of this inspection work in Jiangxi Province is that the inspection methods and content emphasize both the "virtual" and the "real." First is to ask about ideology, talk about politics, inspect guidelines and policies, and inspect relations in all aspects; second is to inspect measures, grasp advanced experiences, and inspect the current situation of completing the leap forward plan. The inspection method also emphasizes solving problems while inspecting, and promoting advanced experiences, so that the inspection is effective on the spot and immediately promotes work.
    Yang Shangkun, First Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, personally takes command as the head of the inspection general team, with two other secretaries serving as deputy heads. The general team is divided into eight sub-teams according to region.
    Today, Yang Shangkun, head of the general team, made a mobilization report to the cadres from provincial and Nanchang municipal organs who are participating in the inspection team. He said that leaders at all levels have already taken hold of agriculture. Now, it is necessary and possible to take out a certain amount of strength and spend a certain amount of time to focus on grasping industry, and also grasp finance and trade, culture and education, and other aspects of work. The inspection team will depart in the coming days.

    全面抓起工业  带动各项工作
　　江西省委组成万人检查团
    新华社南昌10日电　中共江西省委组成万人检查团，决定以一个半月的时间集中检查工业生产，同时检查财政贸易、文化教育、交通邮电等方面的工作。省委要求，通过这次大规模的检查，摸清当前工业方面的问题和情况，总结工业建设的经验，迅速推动工业生产的大跃进；通过这次检查，进一步调动各方面的力量，支援农业生产大跃进。
    检查团由省、专区、县和基层单位四方面的力量组成，共有一万多干部；同时吸收部分群众参加。省委认为，这种上下结合、领导与群众相结合的检查团，是当前抓工业的一个有效方法，它可以使省委在一个比较短的时间内把工业全面抓起来，同时又可以把各方面的工作带动起来，促进全面跃进。
    江西省这次检查工作的一个特点，是检查方法和内容强调虚实并举。首先是问思想、谈政治，检查方针政策，检查各方面的关系；其次是检查措施，抓先进经验，检查当前完成跃进计划的情况。检查方法还强调边检查，边解决问题，边推广先进经验，使检查当场见效，立即推动工作。
    中共江西省委第一书记杨尚奎亲自挂帅，任检查总团团长，另有两个书记任副总团长。总团下按地区设八个分团。
    今天，总团团长杨尚奎向省级机关和南昌市级机关参加检查团工作的干部做了动员报告。他说，各级领导已经把农业抓了起来。现在，有必要和可能拿出一定的力量，花一定的时间突击抓一下工业，并抓一下财贸、文教等方面的工作。检查团将在近日出发。
