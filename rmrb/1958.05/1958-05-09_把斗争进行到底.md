Carry the Struggle Through to the End
Commentator of this newspaper

After the Indonesian government forces recovered Bukittinggi, the main city occupied by the rebel group, on May 4, the Sumatran rebel "government" was basically defeated. This is a major victory for the Indonesian people in their struggle to defend national independence and oppose foreign interference. However, the recovery of Bukittinggi does not mean the end of the anti-rebellion struggle. The remaining rebel forces in Central Sumatra still need to be cleared. Moreover, the center of the rebellion has shifted to North Sulawesi. The Sumual-Somba rebel group entrenched in North Sulawesi has declared Manado as the rebel "government" and continues to carry out rebellion activities.

At this moment, the US imperialism's interference in Indonesia is becoming more blatant. The United States, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, is using aircraft to assist the rebels in bombing vast areas of eastern Indonesia and is stepping up the supply of weapons to help the rebels in North Sulawesi. At the same time, the US propaganda machine openly advocates that the Indonesian government should compromise with the rebels, and spares no effort to create various rumors in an attempt to influence the development of the Indonesian situation. At the recent meeting of foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Group held in Copenhagen, Denmark, Dulles even openly clamored against the Indonesian people's recovery of West Irian, intimidating the Indonesian government and people. The United States' arrogant interference in Indonesia's internal affairs has its ulterior motives. First of all, with the Sumatran rebel "government" already collapsed, the United States still attempts to maintain a last stronghold for the rebels in North Sulawesi, that is, to maintain a base for itself to carry out aggression against Indonesia. Not only that, the United States also attempts to take the opportunity to carry out political conspiracies, divide Indonesia's national unity, in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the Indonesian government. As Indonesian Communist Party General Secretary Aidit said: "If all this is realized, it will create some conditions to suppress the development of nationalist and progressive movements, expand the harassment activities of the Islamic army and strengthen colonialism in West Irian."

However, the blatant interference and political conspiracies of the United States cannot but arouse the indignation of the Indonesian people. "Oppose US interference" and "resolutely and thoroughly crush the rebel group" have become the battle slogans of the Indonesian people. Recently, the Indonesian government has repeatedly stated its insistence on opposing foreign interference and suppressing the rebellion. Prime Minister Djuanda said on May 7 that the Indonesian government will resolutely resolve the rebellion in North Sulawesi and will never back down due to foreign interference. As long as Indonesia unremittingly adheres to the unity of the whole people and strengthens the unity of patriotic and democratic forces, foreign interference and rebellion activities are bound to fail, and the Indonesian people are bound to achieve final victory.

    把斗争进行到底
    本报评论员
    印度尼西亚政府军于5月4日收复叛乱集团盘踞的主要城市武吉丁宜以后，苏门答腊的叛乱“政府”基本上已经被打垮了。这是印度尼西亚人民在捍卫民族独立和反对外国干涉的斗争中所取得的一个重大胜利。但是，武吉丁宜的收复，并不意味着反叛乱斗争的结束。中苏门答腊的叛军残余势力尚待肃清。而且，叛乱活动的中心已转移到北苏拉威西。盘踞在北苏拉威西的苏穆阿尔—宋巴叛乱集团，已宣布万鸦老为叛乱“政府”，继续进行叛乱活动。
    就在这个时候，美帝国主义对印度尼西亚的干涉行动是更加露骨了。美国同台湾蒋介石集团勾结起来，用飞机协助叛乱分子轰炸东印度尼西亚的广大地区，加紧供应武器来帮助北苏拉威西的叛乱分子。同时，美国宣传机关公然主张印度尼西亚政府应该同叛乱分子妥协，并且不惜制造各种谣言，企图影响印度尼西亚局势的发展。最近在丹麦哥本哈根召开的北大西洋集团外长会议上，杜勒斯更公开叫嚷反对印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安，对印度尼西亚政府和人民进行恫吓。美国之所以如此狂妄地干涉印度尼西亚内政，有其不可告人的目的。首先，在苏门答腊叛乱“政府”已经垮台的今天，美国仍然企图在北苏拉威西为叛乱分子保住一块最后的阵地，也就是给它自己保持一个向印度尼西亚进行侵略的基地。不仅这样，美国还企图乘机进行政治阴谋，分化印度尼西亚的民族团结，以达到推翻印度尼西亚政府的目的。正如印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地所说的：“假如这一切实现，就会创造一些条件，来镇压民族主义运动和进步运动的发展，扩大伊斯兰教军的骚扰活动和在西伊里安加强殖民主义”。
    但是，美国的露骨干涉和政治阴谋，不能不引起印度尼西亚人民的愤慨。“反对美国干涉”，“坚决彻底地粉碎叛乱集团”，已成了当前印度尼西亚人民的战斗口号。最近印度尼西亚政府也一再表明坚持反对外国干涉和镇压叛乱。朱安达总理在5月7日说，印度尼西亚政府将坚决地解决北苏拉威西的叛乱，而且决不会因为外国干涉而退缩。只要印度尼西亚始终不懈地坚持全民的团结，加强爱国民主力量的团结，外国干涉和叛乱活动是一定要失败的，印度尼西亚人民是一定会得到最后胜利的。
