Xinhua News Agency, Xushui, 24th. How should downward-sent cadres undergo comprehensive training? Does working well necessarily mean being well-trained? The Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Hebei Province recently organized a major debate among all downward-sent cadres in the county. After this debate, the cadres sent to the county have advanced from the previous stage of mainly physical labor to a new period of comprehensive training in labor, work, and ideology.

Generally, the cadres sent to the rural areas of Xushui County for labor training have undergone three or four months of labor, with about 80% of them having initially experienced training in production, life, and political struggle, and about half of the cadres being selected as models by the commune or team, or praised by the commune members. However, some people have a unclear understanding of the policy of sending cadres down for labor training, believing that as long as they work well, they will be well-trained and transformed, and thus bury themselves in labor without actively participating in various activities in the countryside.

Based on these circumstances, the Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a meeting of all downward-sent cadres in late April, launching a major airing of views and debate. Through this airing of views and debate, people further realized that the fundamental purpose of sending cadres down for training is to establish class feelings for the working people through participation in labor, and to establish the view of taking the interests of the masses as one's own interests.

After clarifying how to conduct training, many cadres made plans at the meeting to leverage their expertise in production labor to help agricultural cooperatives improve production and construction.

After solving the ideological problems, the County Committee also appropriately reduced the distribution area of the downward-sent cadres, increasing the number of cadres in each commune from the original few to more than ten, and in each team from one or two to four or five, and established groups. The County Committee also clearly stipulated that each downward-sent cadre should spend about two-thirds of the year working in the fields, and the rest of the time participating in social activities and self-studying their specialties, to achieve the goal of being both red and expert.

After the major debate, the downward-sent cadres in the county have helped agricultural cooperatives to establish an amateur accounting training class and an agricultural machinery technology training class, repaired the portable boilers, gas generators, telephones, and radio receivers of thirty-three agricultural cooperatives, helped agricultural cooperatives to establish seven agricultural middle schools, and assisted twenty-four agricultural cooperatives in establishing and improving clubs, libraries, reading groups, and blackboards, carrying out cultural propaganda work. At the same time, they also helped agricultural cooperatives to run an amateur Pingju opera training class, and organized two cultural and art troupes, drama troupes, and a slide projection group, enlivening the cultural life of the countryside. In addition, they also helped the Communist Party branches in five villages to establish and improve the party class system, regularly giving party lessons to rural party members, and strengthening ideological education within the party. While carrying out the above-mentioned various tasks, the downward-sent cadres also started to help the townships and cooperatives where they are located to cultivate nine advanced cooperatives and twenty-four advanced production teams.

In order to better train the downward-sent cadres, the Xushui County Committee of the Communist Party of China has further strengthened its leadership over the downward-sent cadres. In addition to designating a deputy secretary to be in charge of the work of the downward-sent cadres, the County Committee also appointed some downward-sent cadres to participate in the party and government leadership work of the townships and cooperatives as needed. The County Committee also determined that the Township Party Committee should discuss the work of the downward-sent cadres once every two months, and hold a symposium of all the downward-sent cadres in the township once a month to listen to the opinions of the downward-sent cadres, help them solve problems, and exchange experiences in comprehensive training. In addition, the County Committee has decided that the downward-sent cadres will hold a political life meeting every half a month, and conduct a quarterly comparison and evaluation at the township level.

    徐水县委领导下放干部进行怎样锻炼的大辩论
    干部认识提高开始全面锻炼
    据新华社徐水24日电　下放干部怎样进行全面锻炼？劳动好是否就是锻炼得好？中共河北省徐水县委最近组织全县的下放干部进行了大辩论。下放到这个县的干部经过这一次辩论后，已经从前一阶段的以体力劳动为主跃进到一个劳动、工作、思想全面锻炼的新时期。
    下放到徐水县农村劳动锻炼的干部，一般都经过了三、四个月的劳动，其中有80％左右初步经过了生产、生活和政治斗争的锻炼，有半数左右的干部被选为社、队的模范或受到社员群众的赞扬。但是，也有些人对下放劳动锻炼的方针认识不清，认为只要劳动好，就是锻炼改造得好，因而埋头劳动，没有积极地参加农村中的各种活动。
    中共徐水县委根据这些情况，在4月下旬召开了一次全体下放干部会议，发动他们进行大鸣大放大辩论。经过这次鸣放辩论，人们进一步认识到，通过参加劳动建立起劳动人民的阶级感情，树立以群众利益为个人利益的观点，才是下放锻炼的根本目的。
    应该怎样进行锻炼明确以后，许多干部在会上就作出了在生产劳动中发挥自己专长帮助农业社搞好生产建设的计划。
    解决了思想问题后，县委又适当地收缩了下放干部的分布面，每个社的下放干部由原来的几个人增到十几人，每个队也由一两人增加到四五个人，并建立起小组。县委还明确规定下放干部每人每年用三分之二左右的时间下地劳动，其余的时间用来参加社会活动和自修自己的专长，以达到又红又专的目的。
    经过大辩论以后，全县的下放干部已帮助农业社办起一个业余的会计训练班和一个农业机械技术训练班，包修了三十三个农业社的锅驼机、煤气机、电话和无线电收音机，帮助农业社筹办了七所农业中学，协助二十四个农业社建立和健全起俱乐部、图书馆、读报组和黑板报，开展了文化宣传工作。同时还帮助农业社办了一个业余评剧训练班，组织起两个文工团、话剧团和一个幻灯组，活跃了农村的文化生活。另外又帮助五个村的中共支部，建立和健全起党课制度，定期的给农村党员上党课，加强了党内的思想教育。在开展上述各种工作的同时，下放干部们还着手帮助所在地的乡社，培养九个先进社、二十四个先进生产队。
    为使下放干部锻炼得更好，中共徐水县委还进一步加强了对下放干部的领导。县委除指定一个副书记主管下放干部工作外，并根据需要确定一些下放干部分别参加乡、社的党政领导工作。县委还确定乡党委每两个月讨论一次下放干部工作，每月召开一次全乡下放干部座谈会，听取下放干部的意见，帮助他们解决问题，交流全面锻炼的经验。另外，县委已决定下放干部每半月开一次政治生活会，每季以乡为单位进行一次评比。
