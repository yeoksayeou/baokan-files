    Lingling and Hengnan Become "Malaria-Free Counties"
    (Our report) According to the Health News, Lingling and Hengnan counties in Hunan Province have basically eliminated the four pests and have also basically eliminated malaria, becoming "malaria-free counties."
    In order to comprehensively carry out malaria eradication work, Lingling County drew 70 epidemic prevention workers from various joint clinics in the winter of 1957 and conducted short-term training in malaria epidemiology and prevention and control measures. In February of this year, a county-wide malaria survey was completed. The county also organized more than 600 health cadres, joint clinic medical personnel, and health workers to carry out comprehensive anti-relapse treatment for malaria to those identified as needing medication. By the end of March, the county had completed anti-relapse treatment for 1,430 people. In this work, medical personnel generally delivered medicine to people's doors and to the fields. In addition, the county also adopted a series of measures such as mosquito extermination, mosquito prevention, preventive medication, systematic treatment, training of anti-malaria personnel, and the establishment and improvement of rural epidemic prevention networks and mobile medical stations. Before the May Day holiday this year, the county basically eliminated malaria while also basically achieving the "four withouts" (rats, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs).
    Hengnan County became the second "malaria-free county" in Hunan Province on May 8.

    零陵、衡南成“无疟县”
    本报讯　据健康报报道：湖南零陵、衡南两县在基本消灭四害的同时，已基本消灭了疟疾，成为“无疟县”。
    零陵县为了全面开展消灭疟疾工作，1957年冬季抽调各联合诊所防疫员七十人，进行了疟疾流行病学和防治措施的短期训练。今年2月完成了全县的疟疾普查。这个县又组织卫生干部、联合诊所医务人员和卫生员六百多人，对被确定为服药的对象进行了全面的疟疾抗复发治疗。到3月底，全县已完成抗复发治疗一千四百三十人。在这一工作中，医务人员一般做到了送药上门，田间送药。此外，这个县还采取了灭蚊、防蚊、预防服药、系统治疗、培养抗疟员、建立与健全农村防疫网和巡回医疗站等一系列的措施。在今年五一节前，这个县在基本实现四无的同时，也基本消灭了疟疾。
    衡南县在5月8日成为湖南省的第二个“无疟县”。
