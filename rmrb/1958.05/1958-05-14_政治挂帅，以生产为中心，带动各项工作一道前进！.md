　　Put Politics in Command, Take Production as the Center, and Promote All Work Together!
　　Jiang Weiqing, First Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　(I)
    Following Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly handling contradictions among the people and the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we have, on the basis of achieving a decisive victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, adopted the approach of "putting politics in command, taking production as the center, and promoting all work together," and have launched the "three waves" of the rectification movement and production, resulting in a new situation of "two upsurges" in rectification and production.
    How was this new situation formed? In November last year, Jiangsu Province held a provincial party representative conference, adopting the forms of extensive airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters, debating major issues such as unified purchase and sales, cooperativization, Party leadership, worker-peasant relations, and military-civilian relations, distinguishing between major rights and wrongs, and achieving a major victory in the struggle between the two roads on the ideological and political fronts. At the same time, we also focused on criticizing right-leaning conservative thinking, establishing the leaping-forward thinking of "wanting to jump, daring to jump, and being able to jump," and put forward the slogan of "working hard, working practically, and working creatively." After the meeting, the vast majority of representatives, with the force of tigers descending the mountain, led a large-scale winter production movement. At this time, the provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county-level organs also carried out extensive airing of views, major rectification and major changes, streamlining organizations, delegating cadres, strengthening the grassroots, and strengthening the labor front, which played a great role in promoting the great leap forward in production. This was the first wave. Since January of this year, party representative conferences have been held in various cities and counties throughout the province. In addition to continuing to resolve the struggle between the two roads, they have also focused on carrying out the struggle between advanced and backward thinking, between the two methods of more, faster, better, and more economical versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive, and between the two styles of persuasion and coercion. During this period, in accordance with the spirit of the Hangzhou Conference, we convened the Sixth Plenary Session of the Provincial Party Committee, reviewed the situation of winter-spring production plans lagging behind the mass movement, put forward the slogan of "hard work for five years, achieving five hundred jin and eight hundred jin ahead of schedule," and subsequently held water conservancy conferences in different areas to promote the winter production movement centered on water conservancy construction. In this way, we basically achieved five "follow-ups," namely, ideological follow-up, planning follow-up, policy follow-up, technical follow-up, and cadre leadership follow-up. After the meeting, grassroots rectification in rural and urban areas also unfolded in depth. Although it was the cold winter months, the attendance rate of cooperatives increased from 70% to over 90%, and the labor enthusiasm of the masses was unprecedentedly high. This was the second wave. In late February of this year, the Provincial Party Committee convened meetings of prefectural, municipal, and county party secretaries in three groups to convey and study Chairman Mao's "Sixty Methods of Work," clarified the idea of continuous revolution, and earnestly discussed the issue of ideological methods and working methods. At this meeting, the situation of the winter production movement was reviewed, achievements were affirmed, and shortcomings such as "floating without depth, coarse without detail, and flashy without substance" were pointed out in the work, requiring deep, meticulous, and practical work. Then, in accordance with the Central Committee's instructions on carrying out the anti-waste and anti-conservative movement, the "double-anti" and "double-comparison" movements were launched. Factories, mines, enterprises, organs, schools, cooperatives, and residents throughout the province were boiling, posting more than 160 million big-character posters, attacking waste and fiercely attacking conservatism, sweeping away the "five airs," and launching an unprecedentedly large-scale upsurge of comparing advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical. Rural areas in various places firmly grasped production plans, organized airing of views and debates, rooted the targets, increased the measures, and everyone took on heavy burdens, engaging in spring plowing in a down-to-earth manner. This was the third wave.
    The characteristics of these three waves are: (1) Each wave took rectification as the key link, promoted a surge in production, and each wave was higher than the previous one. By the third wave, rectification and production were completely integrated, converging into a broad mass movement for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. (2) Each wave involved the leadership believing in the majority of the masses, daring to set themselves on fire, and boldly mobilizing the masses, combining airing of views, debates, and rectification together, implementing major destruction and major establishment. By the third wave, the masses not only aired their views fully, but also aired them healthily, and the leadership also rectified quickly and effectively, and a new political situation emerged. (3) The development process of the surge in production was led by agriculture taking the lead, followed by promoting a high tide in industrial production, and then a high tide in cultural education, thus forming a comprehensive great leap forward situation centered on industrial and agricultural production. After this process, the people clearly understood the relationship between rectification and production. They said: "Stoking the rectification furnace will ignite the fire of production," "When politics takes command, production soars to the sky," "Rectification is like a warm spring breeze, blowing flowers to bloom all over the trees." The development of the actual situation in Jiangsu fully proves that what Comrade Shaoqi said in his report is completely correct: "The key link of rectification has driven all the work of the Party and the country. The Party's rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle have developed into a nationwide rectification movement, and the high tide of the nationwide rectification has further promoted the high tide of nationwide production and construction."
    Why does rectification promote a surge in production? Because after we achieved a great victory in the anti-Rightist struggle, we took adjusting the mutual relations among the people, mainly adjusting the relations between the leadership and the masses, as the central content of rectification. Because many cadres have varying degrees of bureaucratism, do not consult with the masses enough when things happen, and some grassroots cadres still have a coercive and commanding style. This has made some workers and peasants feel unequal to some extent, affecting the complete establishment of their sense of ownership and limiting the full play of their enthusiasm and creativity. The rectification movement vigorously criticized the bureaucratism, sectarianism, and subjectivism of cadres, as well as the airs of officialdom, stagnation, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness. At the same time, through measures such as delegating cadres, cadres participating in labor, workers participating in management, and democratic management of cooperatives, some of the gaps that originally existed between cadres and the masses were gradually eliminated. Cadres treat the masses with an equal attitude, and the masses trust the cadres even more, and a truly comradely relationship between them has developed. The masses saw that cadres took the lead in labor and production, changing their work style and working methods, and said: "If cadres can go into the sea, we can capture dragons," "With intimate family members in charge, we are ten times more motivated to work"; "Cooperativization means people joining the cooperative; great debate means hearts joining the cooperative. Cadres and the masses are of one mind, and work together to produce a thousand catties." In this way, the superiority of the socialist system has been further brought into play, and the social productive forces have also been further liberated. While adjusting the relationship between the leadership and the masses, we also carried out a rectification movement among bourgeois intellectuals. Through double-anti and double-comparison, adopting methods such as big-character posters and heart-to-heart talks, we conducted a relatively full exposure and sharp criticism of bourgeois ideology in scientific research and school education, thoroughly discredited bourgeois individualism, and they reflected that this was a "raging fire" that "truly burned to the point of pain." We also organized them to take turns participating in labor training, so as to gradually integrate with workers and peasants and better serve production, and have achieved initial results. In this way, favorable conditions have been created for the combination of science and technology and production, and the promotion of production development.
    We deeply realize that the rectification movement is a communist ideological liberation movement. Only by establishing communist ideology can people thoroughly eliminate all old ideas and old habits that serve the old system, thereby obtaining true spiritual liberation. Only when people's political orientation is correct and their minds are liberated can they wholeheartedly engage in socialism; only when individualism is opposed can they wholeheartedly engage in collectivism; only when right-leaning conservative thinking is overcome can they build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way; with the growth of collectivist thinking, the mutual relations within the working people will inevitably be further improved. When we carry out socialist construction, in order to better exert the power of people and fight against nature, we must correctly resolve the mutual relations between people. "Seeing things but not people" and "being practical but not ideological" are erroneous tendencies that ignore politics. Politics will always exist. Without grasping ideology and politics, we cannot properly handle the mutual relations between people, and therefore we will not be able to exert the power of people to fight against nature and carry out production and construction. In the process of rectification, in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we have realized putting politics in command, promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and achieved a victory for socialism on the ideological and political fronts, developed criticism and self-criticism, promoted the communist spirit, and correctly adjusted the relations among the people, thus powerfully guiding hundreds of millions of working people to make a major advance towards nature. Now, with "rectification as the key link," we must carry the rectification movement through to the end; after the rectification movement is over, we must always adhere to "putting politics in command" to ensure the building of socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

　　(II)
    Through this period of practice, we deeply realize that the process of rectification and production upsurge is essentially the process of implementing the policy of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao had already summarized the experience of our country's construction based on the urgent wishes of the people and the creation of mass struggles, and put forward the policy of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Following this policy line, the socialist construction cause must be vigorous, happy, and proactive everywhere; leaving this policy line will inevitably be cold, slow, and passive everywhere.
    Now, going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way has become the actual action of hundreds of millions of people. The people's vigorous revolutionary will and the communist style of breaking through obstacles are very clear, and the pride and confidence of revolutionary heroism and the great courage to dare to speak and dare to act are very vivid and strong. The economic face of the country and the spiritual face of the people are changing day by day. In factories, a competition movement of "everyone looking for opponents, everyone comparing advanced, and rolling forward to catch up with the advanced" has generally appeared. Many factories are looking for teachers and friends, visiting advanced places, collecting advanced information at home and abroad, learning from advanced "pace-setters," and determined to surpass them. New products have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. "Leap Forward" brand cars, "Ganjing" brand tractors, pottery cylinder gas stoves, nylon 11, alkali-free glass silk, four-silk thin steel sheets, steel glass... and so on, have been successfully trial-produced one after another. Many products have caught up with and surpassed international levels. Now, the mysterious concept of running industry has been broken, and a wave of "counties developing industry, townships running industry, and societies actively participating" has been launched. In rural areas, doing production is no longer an ordinary way of doing it, but a national effort, with men, women, old and young working together, marching towards nature with the spirit of past revolutionary wars. In one winter and spring, the province has built 3.4 billion cubic meters of earthwork and stonework for water conservancy, increasing the irrigated area by 14 million mu, improving the irrigated area by 17 million mu, treating waterlogging area by 31 million mu, and accumulating 56 billion dan of fertilizer, averaging more than 60,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. Since the Party Committee of 23 townships in Changshu County put forward the competitive initiative of "wheat catching up with rice, rice doubling," the province has launched a huge socialist evaluation and competition movement. In the evaluation and competition, various places have generally launched the red flag grabbing movement, forming a hot wave of advanced constantly advancing, and backward catching up to and even surpassing the advanced. In the process of hard work, people's creativity has been greatly brought into play. Using brains, doing everything possible, the more they do, the more detailed they become, and the more methods they have, this is the outstanding phenomenon in agricultural production today. The reform of old farm tools and the promotion of new farm tools have reached more than 710,000 pieces, and the buds of mass technological revolution have appeared. In addition, great achievements have also been made in developing cultural education, eliminating the four pests, and planting trees and afforestation. Workers and peasants have put forward many heroic slogans and songs in the struggle, such as: "Ten points target, twelve points measures, twenty-four points effort," "The 25,000-li Long March was walked by people, and high-yield production is achieved by people," "Aspirations are higher than the sky, effort rushes to the clouds, scoop up the seawater, cut off the barren mountains, and use this energy to realize the forty articles," and so on. All of these fully prove that going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way is a policy line that concentrates and embodies the thoughts, feelings, and revolutionary style of our great era and great people.
    According to the policy line of building socialism and the actual situation in Jiangsu, we are determined to unite the entire Party, rely on the people of the province, work hard for three years to basically change the face of Jiangsu, and work hard for five years or a little longer to completely change the face of Jiangsu. In agriculture, in 1958, we must try every means to overcome all difficulties, and on the basis of 1957, increase grain by 20% to 25%, cotton by 20% to 25%, oil crops by 50% to 60%, pigs by 80% to 100%, and silkworm cocoons by 20% to 25%. In 1962 or a little longer, we will fully realize the various targets stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program. In industry, in 1958, the output value of our local industry will increase by more than 40% compared with 1957, and in 1962 or a little longer, the local industry of the province will increase by three or four times on the basis of 1957, and the industrial output value will account for about 60% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. With the development of industrial and agricultural production, scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings will also develop accordingly. During the second five-year plan, we will establish the Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Academy of Sciences and the scientific research institutes of special zones and provincial-轄 cities, and develop various specialized schools and university education according to actual needs, and cultivate and establish a team of Marxist theoretical workers. We will basically eliminate illiteracy and popularize primary school education in one or two years, and popularize junior high school education in three or five years. We will strive to basically achieve "four noes" and eliminate schistosomiasis in two or three years.
    Production is the material basis of all work. Only when production leaps forward can other work leap forward; conversely, if production cannot leap forward, it will be difficult for other work to leap forward. Therefore, we must adhere to putting politics in command, taking production as the center, and promoting all work together, and truly achieve outstanding production, concentrated strength, and effective measures. In our local party committees, we must put doing a good job in agriculture in the first place of work, and grasp agriculture with the right hand and industry with the left hand. As long as we start the first shot of the great leap forward in agriculture this year and achieve a great harvest in agricultural production, industrial production this autumn and winter and next year will definitely make more rapid progress, and all work will definitely achieve more rapid development.

　　(III)
    In order to resolutely implement the policy line of socialist construction and ensure the completion of the above-mentioned targets in our province, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions of "combining the virtual and the real" and "using the virtual to lead the real," and often pay attention to grasping political and ideological work. In the cause of socialist revolution and construction, there are contradictions and struggles between people, and between people and nature. The struggle between the two roads is quite long-term and will be repeated; the struggle between advanced and backward will always exist; the struggle between people and nature is arduous and complex. Our direction is correct, and the mainstream of work is healthy, but we should have sufficient estimates for the difficulties in the advance. As long as we have full foresight and unlimited courage, and are good at resolving contradictions and overcoming difficulties, we can achieve the expected goals.
    We have noticed that people have various attitudes towards socialist construction. One type of people resolutely supports the line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. They have a firm stand, are full of energy, dare to speak and dare to act; they learn from the advanced, rely on themselves, start from scratch, and they vow to be the masters of nature, not slaves of nature. They are promoters. Another type of people is satisfied with the usual speed of construction, watching the trend, following the crowd, and they think that "it would be better to leap forward, but there is no certainty." They are centrists. After the practice and education of the movement, the majority of the centrists have turned to the left. There is also a type of people who think that the current situation is "a gust of wind," watching with a cold eye and "waiting to see," and once there is a disturbance, they will rise up and make comments: "I said it couldn't be done." Among them, some have serious resistance to the Party's policies. They are demoters. We must closely rely on the promoters, unite and educate the centrists, and criticize and oppose the demoters. In our future work, we must often understand and grasp the political and ideological trends of the people, constantly carry out political and ideological work, and constantly carry out the struggle between the two lines and the two methods. Whenever we encounter new tasks, new contradictions, and new difficulties, we must mobilize cadres and the masses to conduct airing of views and debates, organize ideological exchanges, seek to improve understanding, unify thoughts, and unify actions. Only in this way can we ensure that our construction cause advances vigorously and vividly, rather than being a pool of stagnant water, cold and desolate. At the same time, we must do our work more deeply, meticulously, and practically, combining revolutionary enthusiasm with a pragmatic scientific attitude, and always pay attention to overcoming shortcomings in certain links, so as not to accumulate problems and not give the demoters a chance to take advantage.
    In front of us, there are still arduous and complex struggles between people and nature. In agricultural production, we will not only encounter general natural disasters, but also may encounter particularly large disasters that are irresistible by human power. We should make full estimates of natural disasters ideologically, and make full preparations in terms of measures and technology, so that once disasters occur, we will not be stunned and helpless, but will be confident and overcome difficulties. When disasters occur, a small number of people who oppose socialist construction will take the opportunity to sabotage. Among the people, some people will be discouraged by this, express doubts about the leap forward, and may even produce pessimistic and disappointed emotions. Therefore, while fighting against natural disasters, we should pay special attention to preventing the "ideological disasters" that come with them. We must have an indomitable heroic spirit and resolutely fight against natural disasters. Not long ago, some areas of the province suffered from late frost and hail disasters, and the majority of cadres and the masses adopted this positive attitude. They said: "Iron-clad determination, steel-cast energy, heroes never bow their heads, and they are not discouraged in the face of difficulties," "If one season is lost, plant two seasons well, and still produce 800 jin."
    The leadership of the Party is the fundamental guarantee of socialist construction. We must closely unite around the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, and strengthen the leading role of the Party in all work. As Comrade Shaoqi pointed out in his report: "Any work, if it departs from the leadership of the Party, will deviate from the overall political tasks, deviate from the common struggle goals of the broad masses of the people, and deviate from the correct ideological methods and working methods." In order to ensure the interests of the broadest masses of the people, and in order to ensure the interests of the socialist revolution and construction cause, we must resolutely implement the principle of "centralizing major power and decentralizing minor power," and oppose departmentalism, decentralism, and localism.
    We must strengthen learning. Chairman Mao's "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and "Sixty Methods of Work" and other works are creative applications and developments of Marxist-Leninist materialism and dialectics, and will always be our ideological weapons. We have generally established theoretical study groups in party committees at all levels above the county level, taking the main problems in the current work as the center, and closely combining learning theory, learning policies, discussing problems, writing articles, and guiding the current work. More than 50,000 cadres above the township level in our province have planted more than 110,000 mu of experimental fields, the vast majority of cadres in factories and mines have conducted follow-up labor, and leading cadres at all levels have organized the study of scientific and technological knowledge according to their own circumstances. We have delegated 130,000 cadres to participate in industrial and agricultural labor and strengthen grassroots work. We must arm cadres with communist ideology and modern science and technology and culture, achieve both redness and expertise, and adapt to the requirements of the great technological revolution and cultural revolution.
    We will resolutely follow the general line and general policy of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, unite all party members in Jiangsu, lead the people of the province, work diligently, adhere to the truth, correct mistakes, guard against pride and exaggeration, encourage and help each other, and advance bravely under the victorious banner of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao!

　　政治挂帅，以生产为中心，带动各项工作一道前进！
　　中共江苏省委第一书记　江渭清
　　（一）
    我们遵照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题的指示和党的八届三中全会的精神，在反右派斗争取得了决定性胜利的基础上，采取了“政治挂帅，以生产为中心，带动各项工作一道前进”的做法，掀起了整风运动和生产的“三次浪潮”，出现了整风和生产“两高涨”的崭新局面。
    这个新的局面是怎样形成的呢？去年十一月，江苏省举行全省党代表大会，采取大鸣大放、大争大辩、大字报的形式，辩论了统购统销、合作化、党的领导、工农关系、军民关系等重大问题，分清了大是大非，取得了在思想战线和政治战线上两条道路斗争的重大胜利。同时，我们还着重批判了右倾保守思想，树立了“要跳、敢跳、能跳”的跃进思想，提出了“苦干、实干、创造性地干”的口号。会后，绝大多数代表以猛虎下山之势，领导了大规模的冬季生产运动。这时，省、地、市、县各级机关也都进行了大放大鸣，大整大改，紧缩机构，下放干部，加强基层，加强劳动战线，对生产大跃进起了很大的促进作用。这是第一个浪潮。今年一月以来，全省各市、县举行党代表大会，除继续解决两条道路的斗争外，还着重开展了先进和落后两种思想、多快好省和少慢差费两种方法、说服和压服两种作风的斗争。在这个时间内，我们根据杭州会议的精神，召开了省委六次全会，检查了冬春生产规划落后于群众运动的情况，提出了“苦战五年，提前实现五百斤八百斤”的口号，并随后分片召开了水利会议，推动以兴修水利为中心的冬季生产运动。这样，就基本上做到了五个“跟上”，即思想跟上，规划跟上，政策跟上，技术跟上，干部带头跟上。会后，农村城市的基层整风，也都深入展开。这时虽是寒冬腊月，合作社的出勤率由百分之七十增加到百分之九十以上，群众的劳动热情空前高涨，这是第二个浪潮。今年二月下旬，省委分三片召开了地、市、县委书记会议，传达和学习了毛主席的“工作方法六十条”，明确了不断革命的思想，认真讨论了思想方法和工作方法的问题。在这次会议上，检查了冬季生产运动的情况，肯定了成绩，指出了在工作上还存在着“浮而不深、粗而不细、华而不实”的缺点，要求深入地干、细致地干、踏实地干。接着，遵照中央关于开展反浪费、反保守运动的指示，掀起了“双反”、“双比”运动。全省工矿、企业、机关、学校、合作社和居民都沸腾起来了，贴出了大字报一亿六千多万张，痛击浪费，猛攻保守，横扫五气，掀起了空前规模的比先进、比多快好省的热潮。各地农村紧紧抓住生产规划，组织鸣放辩论，使指标扎根，措施加码，人人挑起千斤重担，踏踏实实干春耕。这是第三个浪潮。
    这三次浪潮的特点是：（1）每次浪潮都是以整风为纲，促进了生产高涨，而且是一浪高一浪，到了第三次，整风和生产就完全结合在一起，汇合成多快好省地建设社会主义的广大的群众运动了。（2）每次浪潮都是领导上相信群众大多数，敢于引火烧身，放手发动群众，把鸣放、辩论、整改结合在一起，实行大破大立，到第三次，群众不仅放得充分，而且放得健康，领导也改得迅速有力，一个新的政治局面就出现了。（3）生产高涨的发展过程，是由农业一马当先，接着推动了工业生产的高潮，随后又掀起了文化教育的高潮，这样就形成了以工农业生产为中心的全面大跃进的形势。经过这一个过程，人民群众对整风和生产的关系，看得非常清楚。他们说：“鼓起整风炉，烧旺生产火”，“政治挂了帅，生产飞上天”，“整风好比暖春风，吹得花开满树红”。江苏实际情况的发展，完全证明少奇同志在报告中所说的：“整风这条总纲带动了党和国家的全部工作。党的整风运动和反右派斗争发展为全民整风运动，而全民整风的高潮，又进一步推动了全民的生产和建设的高潮”，这是完全正确的。
    整风为什么会促进生产的高涨呢？因为我们在取得了反右派斗争的伟大胜利以后，就以调整人民内部的相互关系主要是调整领导与群众的关系作为整风的中心内容。因为在不少干部中，存在着不同程度的官气，遇事和群众商量不够，部分基层干部还有强迫命令的作风。这样就使得一部分工人和农民感到不大平等，影响了他们的主人翁思想的完全确立，限制了他们的积极性和创造性的充分发挥。整风运动有力地批判了干部的官僚主义、宗派主义、主观主义，官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气。同时通过干部下放、干部参加劳动，工人参加管理、民主办社等措施，干部和群众原来存在的某些隔阂就逐渐消除了。干部以平等态度对待群众，群众也就更加信任干部，他们之间真正同志式的关系发展起来了。群众看到干部带头劳动生产、改变工作作风和工作方法，就说：“干部能下海，我们能擒龙”，“有了知心的当家人，干活劲头大十倍”；“合作化，人入社；大辩论心入社。干群一条心，合力干千斤”。这样，社会主义制度的优越性得到进一步的发挥，社会生产力也就得到了进一步的解放。在调整领导与群众关系的同时，我们在资产阶级知识分子中也开展了整风运动，通过双反双比，采取大字报、交心会等方式，对科学研究工作和学校教育工作中的资产阶级思想，进行了比较充分的揭露和尖锐的批判，彻底搞臭资产阶级个人主义，他们反映，这是一把“烈火”，“真正烧到了痛处”。我们还组织他们轮流参加劳动锻炼，以便同工人农民逐渐打成一片，更好地为生产服务，已经取得初步的成效。这样，就为科学技术与生产结合、促进生产的发展，创造了有利的条件。
    我们深刻地体会到：整风运动是一个共产主义的思想解放运动。人们只有树立共产主义思想，才能彻底扫除为旧制度服务的一切旧思想、旧习惯，从而获得精神上的真正解放。人们的政治方向端正了，思想解放了，才能一心搞社会主义；个人主义反掉了，才能一心搞集体主义；右倾保守思想克服了，才能多快好省地建设社会主义；随着集体主义思想的增长，又必然会进一步地改善劳动人民内部的相互关系。当我们进行社会主义建设的时候，为着更好地发挥人的力量，向自然界作斗争，就必须正确地解决人们之间的相互关系。“见物不见人”、“务实不务虚”是一种忽视政治的错误倾向。政治是永远会有的。不抓思想，不抓政治，就不能很好地处理人们之间的相互关系，因而也将不能发挥人的力量去向自然界作斗争，进行生产和建设。在整风的过程中，我们根据党中央和毛主席的指示，实现了政治挂帅，兴无灭资，取得了社会主义在思想战线上和政治战线上的胜利，发展了批评和自我批评，发扬了共产主义精神，正确地调整了人民内部的关系，因而有力地引导了千百万劳动人民向自然界大进军。现在以“整风为纲”，我们一定要把整风运动进行到底；整风运动结束以后，我们更要永远坚持“政治挂帅”，以保证多快好省地建设社会主义。
　　（二）
    经过这一个时期的实践，我们深切地体会到：整风和生产高涨的过程，实质上就是贯彻多快好省地建设社会主义的方针的过程。党中央和毛主席早就根据人民群众的迫切愿望和群众斗争的创造，总结了我国建设的经验，提出了多快好省地建设社会主义的方针。遵循了这条方针路线，社会主义建设事业一定是轰轰烈烈，高高兴兴，处处主动；离开了这条方针路线，必然是冷冷清清、慢慢吞吞、处处被动。
    现在，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义，已经成为千百万群众的实际行动。人民群众蓬勃旺盛的革命意志，势如破竹的共产主义风格，表现得十分鲜明，革命英雄主义的自豪和自信，敢说敢作的伟大气魄，表现得十分生动、强烈。国家的经济面貌和人们的精神面貌正在日新月异地改变着。在工厂里，普遍出现
  “人人找对手，个个比先进，滚滚向前赶先进”的竞赛运动。很多工厂，寻师访友，遍访先进，收集了国内外的先进资料，向先进的“标兵”看齐，立志超过。新产品如雨后春笋一样地出现。“跃进牌”汽车，“干劲牌”拖拉机，陶缸煤气炉，尼龙11，无碱玻璃丝，四丝薄钢皮，钢玻璃……等等，一个接一个地试制成功。有很多产品已经赶上和超过国际水平。现在，办工业的神秘观念被打破了，开展了“县县发展工业，乡乡兴办工业，社社积极参加”的热潮。在农村里，干生产已经不是一个平常的干法，而是全民动手，男女老少一齐干，以过去进行革命战争的精神向大自然进军。一个冬春，全省已兴修水利三十四亿土石方，增加灌溉面积一千四百万亩，改善灌溉面积一千七百万亩，治涝面积三千一百万亩，积肥五百六十亿担，平均每亩积肥六万多斤。自从常熟县二十三个乡党委提出“三麦赶水稻，水稻翻一翻”的竞赛倡议以来，全省掀起了一个规模巨大的社会主义评比竞赛运动。在评比竞赛中，各地一般的都开展了夺红旗运动，形成了先进的不断先进，落后的赶上以至超过先进的热潮。在苦干的过程中，人们的创造性大大得到发挥。大动脑筋、千方百计、越干越细、越干办法越多，这是今天农业生产上突出的现象。旧农具的改革，新农具的推广，已达七十一万多件，群众性的技术革命的萌芽已经出现了。此外，在发展文化教育、除四害、植树造林等方面，也取得了很大的成绩。工人和农民在斗争中提出了许多英雄的口号和歌谣，例如：“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲”，“二万五千里长征是人走过来的，高额丰产是人干出来的”，“志气比天高，干劲冲云霄，戽干大海水，切断荒山腰，就用这股劲，实现四十条”，等等。所有这些，充分证明了鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的方针路线，是集中体现了我们这个伟大时代和伟大人民的思想感情和革命风格。
    根据建设社会主义的方针路线和江苏的实际情况，我们决心团结全党，依靠全省人民，苦战三年基本改变江苏面貌，苦战五年或者多一点时间全面改变江苏面貌。在农业方面，一九五八年要想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，在一九五七年的基础上，使粮食增加百分之二十至二十五，棉花增加百分之二十至二十五，油料增加百分之五十至六十，猪子增加百分之八十至一百，蚕茧增加百分之二十至二十五。一九六二年或者多一点时间，完全实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的各项指标。在工业方面，一九五八年我们地方工业的产值将比一九五七年增加百分之四十以上，一九六二年或者多一点时间，全省地方工业在一九五七年的基础上将增加三倍或四倍，工业产值占工农业总产值的百分之六十左右。工农业生产发展了，科学文教卫生事业也会随着发展。在第二个五年计划期间，成立江苏省科学分院和专区、省辖市的科学研究所，并根据实际需要，发展各种专科学校和大学教育，培养和建立一支马克思主义的理论工作的队伍。我们一年或二年基本扫除文盲和普及小学教育，三年或五年普及初中教育。争取两年或三年基本实现“四无”和消灭血吸虫病。
    生产是一切工作的物质基础，只有生产跃进了，其他工作才会跃进；反之，如果生产不能跃进，其他工作就很难跃进。因此，必须坚持政治挂帅，以生产为中心，带动各项工作一道前进，切实做到生产突出，力量集中，措施得力。在我们地方党委来说，更要把搞好农业放在工作的第一位，要右手抓农业，左手抓工业。只要今年打响了农业大跃进的第一炮，农业生产来一个大丰收，今年秋冬和明年的工业生产就一定会更加突飞猛进，各项工作也一定会获得更加迅速的发展。

    为了坚决执行社会主义建设的方针路线，保证我省上述指标的完成，我们要遵照毛主席“虚实并举”“以虚带实”的指示，经常注意抓紧政治思想工作。在社会主义革命和建设事业中，存在着人与人之间、人与自然之间的矛盾和斗争。两条道路的斗争，是相当长期的，会有反复的；先进与落后的斗争，是永远存在的；人与自然界的斗争，是艰巨复杂的。我们的方向是正确的，工作的主流是健康的，但是对于前进中的困难，应有足够的估计。只要我们有充分的预见和无限的勇气，善于解决矛盾，战胜困难，我们就能达到预期的目的。
    我们注意到：人们对于社会主义建设，是有各种态度的。一种人，坚决拥护鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的路线，他们立场坚定，干劲十足，敢说敢作；他们学习先进，自力更生，白手起家，他们誓做大自然的主人，不做大自然的奴隶。他们是促进派。另一种人，满足于平常的建设速度，看苗头，随大流，他们认为“能跃进更好，但是没有把握”。他们是中间派。经过运动的实践和教育，中间派的大多数已经向左转。还有一种人，认为现在的事情是“一阵风”，冷眼旁观“等着瞧”，一但有个风吹草动，他们就会起来发议论：“我说办不到吧”。他们之中，有的对党的方针政策抱有严重的抵触情绪。他们是促退派。我们必须紧紧依靠促进派，团结和教育中间派，批判和反对促退派。我们在今后工作中，一定要经常了解和掌握人们的政治思想动向，不断进行政治思想工作，不断开展两条路线和两种方法的斗争。凡是遇到新任务、新矛盾、新困难，就要发动干部群众进行鸣放辩论，组织思想交锋，求得提高认识，统一思想，统一行动。只有这样，才能保证我们的建设事业轰轰烈烈、有声有色地前进，而不致是一潭死水，冷冷清清。同时，我们一定要把工作做得更加深入、细致、踏实，把革命干劲与实事求是的科学态度结合起来，要时刻注意克服某些环节上的缺点，不使问题成堆，不给促退派以可乘之机。
    在我们的面前，还有人和自然界的艰巨复杂的斗争，在农业生产方面，不但会遇到一般的自然灾害，而且还可能遇到人力不可抗拒的特大灾害。我们对于自然灾害，思想上要作充分的预计，在措施上、技术上要作充分的准备，一旦灾害发生，不至目瞪口呆、束手无策，而是胸有成竹、战胜困难。当灾害发生时，少数反对社会主义建设的人会乘机破坏，在人民群众中，有些人会因此泄气，对跃进表示怀疑，还可能产生悲观失望的情绪。所以我们在与自然灾害作斗争的同时，特别要注意防止与之俱来的“思想的灾害”。我们一定要有百折不挠的英雄气概，与自然灾害作坚决的斗争。不久以前，本省部分地区遭受晚霜和雹灾，大多数干部和群众就是采取了这种积极的态度。他们说：“铁打的决心，钢铸的干劲，英雄从来不低头，困难面前不灰心”，“打掉一季，种好两季，照干八百斤”。
    党的领导是社会主义建设的根本保证。我们必须紧紧地团结在以毛主席为首的党中央的周围，在一切工作中加强党的领导作用。正如少奇同志在报告中所指出：“任何工作，离开了党的领导，就会脱离总的政治任务，脱离广大人民共同奋斗的目标，脱离正确的思想方法和工作方法”。为了保证最广大人民群众的利益，为了保证社会主义革命和建设事业的利益，我们必须坚决执行“大权独揽，小权分散”的原则，反对本位主义、分散主义和地方主义。
    我们必须加强学习。毛主席的“实践论”、“矛盾论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”和“工作方法六十条”等著作，是马克思列宁主义唯物论和辩证法的创造性的运用和发展，永远是我们的思想武器。我们在县以上的各级党委已经普遍建立了理论学习小组，以当前工作中的主要问题为中心，把学理论、学政策、扯问题、写文章和指导当前工作紧密结合起来。我们全省已有五万多乡以上干部种了十一万多亩的试验田，厂矿绝大多数干部进行了跟班劳动，各级领导干部都已根据自己的情况，组织了科学技术知识学习，我们下放了十三万干部参加工农业劳动和加强基层工作。我们要用共产主义思想和现代科学技术和文化把干部武装起来，达到红透专深，适应伟大的技术革命和文化革命的要求。
    我们坚决遵循鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针总路线，团结江苏的全体党员同志，领导全省人民，兢兢业业，坚持真理，改正错误，力戒骄傲和虚夸，互勉互助，在党中央和毛主席的胜利旗帜下，奋勇前进！
