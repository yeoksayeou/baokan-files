Xinhua News Agency, May 21st, New York Dispatch: The American ruling clique is deeply worried about the deepening of the American economic crisis, and they are holding meetings one after another to discuss ways to "save" the crisis.

The "American Enterprise Association," an organization of large monopoly capital, held a two-day meeting in New York on the 19th. It is said that the purpose of this meeting was to "mobilize" entrepreneurs to seek "ways for private enterprises to help end the recession." Two thousand large entrepreneurs attended the meeting.

President Eisenhower delivered a speech at the meeting on the 20th, pointing out that "all the economic difficulties" of the United States "have by no means become a thing of the past." He said that although the government had taken a series of measures to stimulate the economy, it had not been able to "guarantee prosperity," and that the federal government's increasing expenditures had created a dangerous increase in the budget deficit. He called on American entrepreneurs to "concentrate all their forces and launch a new offensive" against the economic crisis.

The "American Enterprise Consulting Committee" also held a similar meeting not long ago, attended by 100 large entrepreneurs and senior government officials. Most business leaders expressed unease about the business prospects, believing that the economic recession would not "really improve" this year.

In Congress, Democratic Senator Douglas attacked the Republican government for the deterioration of the economic situation. He said that the United States is now experiencing a recession that is "deeper and more severe than the other two post-war recessions." He pointed out that the US industrial production index has fallen by more than 13% since last August, and the operating rate of the entire manufacturing industry is currently only about 70%; the total number of unemployed people in April was 5.1 million, and the number of partially unemployed people was equivalent to 1.3 million fully unemployed workers; basic investment in manufacturing in the second quarter of 1958 decreased by 19% compared with the third quarter of 1957. Douglas pointed out that other economic indicators "also prove similar changes," and all these economic factors clearly show that the United States is now experiencing a "very serious recession."

Douglas also severely criticized the government's decision to "rely almost entirely on increasing military spending in the first half of 1958" to deal with the crisis.

    新华社21日讯　纽约消息：美国统治集团十分忧虑美国经济危机的深入发展，它们正纷纷举行会议来讨论“挽救”危机的办法。
    大垄断资本的组织“美国企业协会”19日在纽约举行了一个期为两天的会议，据说这个会议的目的是要把企业家“动员起来”，寻求“私人企业帮助结束衰退的途径”。参加会议的有两千名大企业家。
    总统艾森豪威尔20日在这个会议上发表演说指出，美国“所有的经济困难决没有成为过去”。他说，虽然政府已经采取了一系列措施来刺激经济，但是却没有能够“保证繁荣”，而且，联邦政府日益增加的开支已经造成了预算赤字增加的危险。他呼吁美国企业家对经济危机“集中一切力量发动一个新的攻势”。
    “美国企业谘询委员会”不久前也举行了一次类似的会议，参加会议的有一百名大企业家和政府高级官员。大多数企业界领袖都对企业前景表示不安，认为经济衰退在今年不会“真正好转”。
    在国会里，民主党参议员道格拉斯就经济情况的恶化攻击共和党政府。他说，美国现在正经受着一次“比战后其他两次衰退都要深刻和严重的衰退”。他指出，美国工业生产指数自去年8月以来已经下降了13％以上，整个制造业的开工率目前大概只有70％；全失业人数在4月份为五百一十万人，半失业人数相当于一百三十万全失业工人；制造业的基本投资在1958年第二季度比1957年第三季度减少了19％。道格拉斯指出，其他经济指标“也证明类似的变化”，这一切经济因素完全清楚地说明，美国现在正经受着“非常严重的衰退”。
    道格拉斯还严厉抨击政府作出的“在1958年上半年几乎完全依靠增加军事开支”来对付危机的决定。
