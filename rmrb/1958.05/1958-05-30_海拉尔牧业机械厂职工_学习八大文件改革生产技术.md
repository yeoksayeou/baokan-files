Xinhua News Agency, Hailar, 29th: The general line of socialist construction has greatly encouraged the revolutionary zeal of the employees of the Hailar Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory in Inner Mongolia. They have proposed "breaking superstitions, boldly innovating, and manufacturing more and better animal husbandry machinery to rapidly realize the technical transformation of animal husbandry production."

In the past two days, a wave of studying and implementing the resolutions and reports of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress has been surging in the Hailar Animal Husbandry Machinery Factory. After work, the employees, disregarding their fatigue, study and discuss the resolutions and reports of the congress before dinner, and study how to carry out the technological revolution.

During the Great Leap Forward, the factory's employees trial-produced and manufactured more than ten kinds of animal husbandry machinery that they had never made before, such as shearing machines, automatic cattle drinkers, electric motors, and universal tractors, breaking the conservative thinking that the factory had poor technical skills and could not produce complex machines. In particular, during the seventeen-day technological innovation movement from May 7th to 23rd, the employees reformed more than eighty technologies, increasing production efficiency by three to nine times respectively, and saving tens of thousands of yuan for the country. However, the employees were not satisfied with these achievements. They have successively proposed plans to create new animal husbandry production machinery and reform production technology. At the same time, they also decided to visit pastoral areas in June to understand the needs of herdsmen and guide them in learning how to use various animal husbandry machinery.

    学习八大文件改革生产技术
    新华社海拉尔29日电　社会主义建设总路线极大地鼓舞了内蒙古海拉尔牧业机械厂职工的革命干劲，他们提出“破除迷信，大胆创造，制造出更多更好的牧业机械来迅速实现对畜牧业生产的技术改造。
    这两天，海拉尔牧业机械厂里掀起了学习和贯彻八大二次会议决议和报告的热潮。职工们每天下班以后，不顾疲倦，在饭前学习和讨论会议的决议和报告，研究如何开展技术革命的问题。
    在大跃进中，这个厂的职工试制和生产了他们从未制造过的剪毛机、自动饮牛器、电动机、万能拖拉机等十多种牧业机械，打破了工厂技术水平差、不能生产复杂机器的保守思想。特别是从5月7日到23日的十七天的技术革新运动中，职工们改革了八十多项技术，使生产效率分别提高三倍到九倍，为国家节约了数万元的资金。但是职工们并未满足这些成就。他们纷纷提出创制新的牧业生产机械和改革生产技术的计划，同时还决定在6月份到牧区访问。了解牧民的需要，指导牧民学习使用各种牧业机械。
