    New Products in Beijing Department Store
    Look, what beautiful sweaters!
    The spring sweaters and vests in the department store feature novel styles and are beautiful and elegant. There are brushed, solid-color women's sweaters; sweaters with various patterns of knitting, embroidery, and appliqué; and various styles of men's and women's children's sweaters and hats. Some of these clothes are trial-produced by workers, some are designed by salespeople based on customer opinions, and some are from abroad. Children's sweaters range from a little over eleven yuan to a little over fourteen yuan; women's sweaters and vests are available for six or seven yuan apiece, and some are in the teens and twenties of yuan.
    Unique alarm clocks
    Shanghai Henglida Clock Factory and Oriental Clock Factory have recently created a variety of new-style small alarm clocks, including square, round, large three-hand, and luminous models, with unique styles and prices ranging from ten to twenty yuan. Samples of these six new-style small alarm clocks have been sent to the Beijing Department Store and will soon be available in large quantities.
    New style sandals
    Summer is coming soon, and the department store has prepared many novel, comfortable, and durable sandals for customers. These sandals are carefully designed by the workers of the Beijing Leather Shoe Factory and the Leather Shoe Production Cooperative during the Great Leap Forward; some of them are jointly researched and created by the department store's sales staff and leather shoe technicians based on customer opinions. Prices range from a little over thirteen yuan to a little over twenty yuan.
    Domestic fiberglass cloth
    A few months ago, the fiberglass cloth we bought was all imported. But now the fiberglass cloth displayed on the counters of the fabric department of the department store is all produced by ourselves. These fiberglass cloths are new products of the Tianjin Jingu Rubber Factory. There are more than twenty colors such as red, green, orange, gray, white, blue, and purple. The quality is very good, and the price is cheap, ranging from four jiao to nine jiao per chi (Chinese foot).
    Fiberglass cloth can be used for tablecloths, changing pads, raincoats, backpacks, etc., and has a wide range of uses. (Jin) (Attached picture)

    看，多么漂亮的毛衣
    百货大楼里春季毛衣、线衣，花样新颖，美观大方。有拉毛素色女毛衣；有织花、挑花、补花各种花样的，还有各种花样的男女童毛衣和帽子。这些衣服的式样，有的是工人们试制的，有的是营业员根据顾客意见设计的，还有的是来自国外。儿童毛衣由十一元多到十四元多；女毛衣和线衣有六、七元一件的，也有十几二十元一件的。

    新式凉鞋
    夏天快到了，百货大楼已经为顾客们准备了许多式样新颖、舒适耐用的凉鞋。这些凉鞋的式样，是在大跃进中，北京皮鞋工厂和皮鞋生产合作社的工人们精心设计出来的；其中一部分是百货大楼的售货员根据顾客的意见与皮鞋技师共同研究创制的。价格由十三元多到二十多元。
    国产玻璃布
    几个月以前，我们买到的玻璃布还都是进口的。可是现在在百货大楼布匹部柜台上摆的玻璃布，已都是我们自己生产的了。这些玻璃布是天津津沽橡胶厂的新产品。有红、绿、橙、灰、白、蓝、紫等二十多种颜色，质量很好，价格便宜，每尺从四角多到九角多。
    玻璃布可以做桌布、尿垫、雨衣、背包等，用途很广。　（津）（附图片）
