    Don't Randomly Place Poison for Eliminating the Four Pests
    Recently, various regions have been vigorously carrying out the campaign to eliminate the four pests and have achieved great results. However, some family members are randomly placing poisons for killing rats everywhere, leading to accidental ingestion by children and causing poisoning.
    For example, in the family dormitories of railway workers in the Manzhouli area, in late April, five children accidentally ingested the medicine and were poisoned. One boy, due to eating too much, has already died.
    This unfortunate incident should draw special attention from families in various regions. It is best to place poisonous medicines in places that are not easily discovered by children, or to have them distributed by designated personnel, placing them into rat holes in a timely manner and then sealing them with mud. This is a safer approach.

    消灭四害的毒药不要乱放
    最近各地区，都在轰轰烈烈地开展除四害运动，取得很大的成绩。但是，有的家属竟将毒害老鼠的药品到处乱放，以致发生小孩误吃，造成中毒。
    如满洲里地区的铁路职工的家属宿舍里，在4月下旬，就有五个小孩误吃药品中毒，其中一个男孩，由于吃的过多，已经死亡。
    这个不幸的事件发生后，应引起各地家属们特别注意。最好是将有毒的药品，放在小孩不易发现的地方，或者由专人发放，及时放到鼠洞里去，然后用泥堵死，这样做比较安全。
