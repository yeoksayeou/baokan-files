    Photography Studios Should Go to the Countryside
    Now, the broad masses of farmers need to take photos. Many production experts very much hope to take some photos of their production achievements to keep as a memento. In particular, old men and old women urgently request that cameras go to the countryside to take photos for them to leave as a memorial for their children and grandchildren. I learned in Luzhen Township, Junan County, Shandong Province, that Wu Haitian, an old man in his seventies, is very supportive of cremation. He said, "I'll take a photo, and after I die, there's no need for a coffin or good clothes, I can be cremated." However, the photography studios in Junan and Linyi counties have never gone deep into the countryside. It is suggested that photography studios in various places quickly carry their equipment down to the countryside, the broad masses welcome you to take photos.

    照像馆应该下乡
    现在广大农民需要照像。许多生产能手很希望把自己的生产成就照几张照片留下来。特别是老大爷老太太迫切要求照相机下乡照个像给他们子孙留作纪念。我在山东莒南县路镇乡了解，七十多岁的老人吴海田，很拥护火葬。他说：“我照张像，死后不用棺材、不用好衣服，可以火葬。”可是莒南、临沂两县的照相馆从没有深入到农村去过。建议各地照相馆，赶快背起机子下乡，广大群众欢迎你们去照像。
