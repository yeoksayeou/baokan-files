A New Path for Chinese Painting Facing the Masses
Shao Luoyang

　　As the storm of the Great Leap Forward swept through Shanghai, the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy proposed on March 6th to national Chinese painters the initiative of “integrating Chinese painting with arts and crafts,” requiring Shanghai's Chinese painters to “strive to have a significant impact on the art design of enamel, porcelain, pottery, embroidery, and other fields within five years.” This initiative is very timely, both in terms of bringing Chinese painting art closer to the broad masses of working people and in terms of improving and enhancing the art design of daily-use industrial products.

　　The Shanghai Chinese Painting Academy already has eleven Chinese painters, including Wang Geyi, Tang Yun, Cheng Shifa, and Li Qiujun, who have been assigned to the Jiuxin and Yifeng Enamel Factories in the first batch. The hands that used to only hold paintbrushes are now engaged in the labor of manufacturing products such as washbasins and mugs. Every morning, we wear work clothes and masks, and work alongside our worker comrades; in the afternoon, we design patterns in the studio; and in the evening, we tutor more than forty young workers in Chinese painting, or chat with the workers. This is how we began our new life under the principle of "eating, living, and working together" with the workers.

　　In just over a month, we have created over a hundred Chinese painting-style decorative designs for washbasins and mugs. These designs were all created with the enthusiastic help of the workers, and almost every one of them reflects the workers' ideas. Therefore, we said to the workers: "We are not only your students in labor, but also your students in enamel art design." These new designs have generally been well received by the workers and sales staff of the China National Department Store. Everyone believes that the use of Chinese painting patterns on enamelware makes people feel friendly, and some say, "Patterns like these have a Chinese flavor." At the same time, the new designs have a wide variety, novel compositions, and can break with conventions. In terms of color, there are also changes such as rich and elegant, complex and simple, which can easily satisfy the preferences of the masses in different regions. However, more importantly, the use of national painting styles can enrich and improve the quality of arts and crafts, and through arts and crafts, Chinese painting can be more widely popularized among the masses.

　　Learning from the working class in labor and tempering our own thinking is also our common wish. In the past, we only knew that artistic creation was a laborious task, but now we realize that making a mug is also not easy. An enamelware product must go through more than a dozen processes to become a finished product. In particular, the workers' high level of class consciousness and enthusiasm for socialist construction educate everyone and increase the old painters' motivation. Although Wang Geyi's hair is already gray, he looks younger after participating in labor. He said happily: "I have turned from sixty to sixteen years old, and now the worker brothers are also relieved about this old man." The female painter Zhou Lianxia is already fifty years old and still refuses to admit old age, and does not ask for leave even with a minor cold. Tang Yun has become a skilled worker in the packaging workshop. He said, "A finished product contains the blood and sweat of so many workers, we must carefully package it to ensure the quality of the finished product." Especially when everyone sees the workers' revolutionary spirit and collectivist spirit, they feel even more keenly the errors of intellectuals' arrogance and pursuit of fame and gain, and they are determined to thoroughly transform themselves and strive to be both red and expert.

　　"Integrating Chinese painting with arts and crafts" is the correct direction for art to serve production. But today is only the beginning. On the road ahead, there will certainly be many difficulties. In the process of labor training, ideological transformation, and art design, we must learn with an open mind and rely closely on the leadership of the Party and the help of the working masses. Let our excellent national painting art bloom magnificently on this broad road of directly serving production! (With pictures)

    国画面向群众的一条新路
    邵洛羊
　　当大跃进的风暴席卷上海的时候，上海中国画院筹委会在3月6日向全国国画家提出了“国画结合工艺美术”的倡议，要求上海的国画家“争取在五年内对搪瓷、瓷器、陶器、刺绣等方面的美术设计发生重要影响。”这一倡议，不论在促使国画艺术与广大劳动人民接近方面，或是对改进和提高日用工业产品的美术设计方面，都是很适时的。
    上海中国画院已有王个簃、唐云、程十发、李秋君等十一位国画家，第一批下放到久新和益丰搪瓷工厂。过去只拿画笔的手，现在却从事制造面盆、口杯等产品的劳动了。每天上午我们都穿着工作服，戴着口罩，和工人同志们一起干活；下午在工作室里设计花样图案；晚上还要辅导四十多位青年工人学习国画，或者找工人谈心。我们就是这样在和工人“同吃、同住、同劳动”的原则下开始了新的生活。
    一个多月来，我们已创作出了一百余幅国画形式的面盆、口杯装饰图样。这些图样都是在工人热情地帮助下创作出来的，几乎幅幅都有工人同志的心意，所以我们对工人说：“不仅在劳动中做你们的学生，就是对搪瓷美术设计，也要做你们的学生。”这些新图样一般都受到了工人和中国百货公司销售人员的好评，大家认为搪瓷上运用国画的图样，使人感到亲切，有的说：“像这样的花样才有中国味道”。同时新图样的品种多、构图新、能打破常规，在色彩方面也有浓艳和淡雅、复杂和单纯等变化，易于满足各不同地区群众的喜爱。但是，更重要的是运用民族绘画的艺术风格能够丰富和提高工艺美术的质量，而通过工艺美术品又能使国画更广泛地普及到群众中去。
    在劳动中向工人阶级学习，锻炼自己的思想，这也是我们共同的心愿。过去只知道艺术创作是煞费精力的劳动，现在才知道制成一只口杯也实非容易。一只搪瓷器皿要经过十多道工序才能变为成品，特别是工人们高度的阶级觉悟和社会主义建设的热情，更教育着大家，使老画家们增加了干劲。王个簃头发虽已斑白，但参加劳动后显得年轻了，他愉快地说：“我六十岁变成十六岁了，现在工人兄弟们也放心我这老头儿了。”女画家周炼霞已经五十岁了还不服老，小感冒也不请假。唐云在包装车间已变成了熟练的工人。他说“一件成品包含了多少工人的血汗在内，我们一定要细心包装，保证成品的质量。”特别是当大家看到工人们的革命干劲和集体主义的精神时，更感到知识分子自高自大和名利思想的错误，决心彻底改造自己，力争又红又专。
    “国画结合工艺美术”这是艺术为生产服务的正确方向。但今天还仅仅是开步走，在前进的道路上，一定还有不少困难，我们在劳动锻炼、思想改造和美术设计的过程中，一定要虚心学习，紧密依靠党的领导和工人群众的帮助。让我们优秀的民族绘画艺术在直接为生产服务的这条康庄大道上怒放奇葩罢！（附图片）
