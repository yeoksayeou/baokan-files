Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 30th: The Kishi Nobusuke government, at a cabinet meeting of ministers related to the economy held on the 29th, concluded that Japan's economic situation could not "recover" in the short term.

This conclusion was made by the Kishi Nobusuke government's cabinet members after studying the economic report for May submitted by the Economic Planning Agency. This report believes that it is impossible to expect a rapid increase in demand and a rapid rise in the economic situation; the work of reducing "excessive" inventory will still take some time, because the prospects for Japanese exports are not optimistic due to the impact of the capitalist world economic crisis and the interruption of trade with China.

Prior to this, Japanese officials had spread an "optimistic" atmosphere, saying that Japan's economic situation would "recover" between April and July this year. However, with the deepening of the American economic crisis, the Japanese economy has become increasingly hopeless, and this time they had to publicly admit that the Japanese economic situation "shows signs of declining again."

One of the bases for the argument that Japan's economic situation was about to "recover" was that the continuous decline in prices since last summer had come to a standstill in March this year, and began to rise slightly at the end of April. However, by mid-May, the price index had fallen by 2.8 points compared to the end of April. Moreover, the downward trend in prices is developing. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun", the steel industry, which occupies an important position in Japanese industry, has recently decided to cut prices to seek sales.

In order to alleviate the pressure of "excessive" inventory, Japan has repeatedly cut production since last summer, with an average of more than one-third of its production equipment not in operation. However, even so, the phenomenon of inventory "surplus" still cannot be improved.

The Economic Planning Agency's economic report for May admits that the current production reduction situation has reached a certain limit from the perspective of enterprises. Even so, the Kishi Nobusuke government, which has led the Japanese economy into a dead end, is still blindly using the method of reducing production to solve the crisis of production "surplus". The cabinet meeting on the 29th decided that from June, coal production should be reduced by 5% compared to the original plan. At the same time, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry decided to "advise" textile factories to continue to implement the current 30% reduction in cotton yarn production from July to September. Japanese manufacturers say that if the government does not change its consistent policy of production reduction, the unemployment problem will become more serious.

### 输出前景黯淡　生产一再削减  日政府承认经济还要下降

    输出前景黯淡　生产一再削减
    日政府承认经济还要下降
    据新华社30日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府在29日举行的同经济有关的内阁阁员会议得出了结论：日本的经济情况不可能在短期内“回升”。
    这个结论是岸信介政府的阁员们在研究了经济企划厅提出的5月份经济报告后作出的。这项报告认为：不能指望需求量迅速增加和经济情况迅速上升；减少“过剩”的库存商品的工作还需要一些时间，因为受资本主义世界经济危机的影响和同中国的贸易中断等原因，日本输出的前景不容乐观。
    在此以前，日本官方曾经散布“乐观”空气，说甚么日本的经济情况在今年4月到7月间就会“回升”。但是，随着美国经济危机的日益深刻化，日本经济越来越没有出路，它们这一次才不得不公开承认，日本的经济情况“显示出再次下降的迹象”。
    所谓日本经济情况就要开始“回升”的论调的根据之一，是从去年夏天开始不断下降的物价在今年3月里出现停顿状态，到了4月底开始微微上升。但是，到了5月中旬，物价指数又比4月底降低了二点八。而且，物价下降的趋势在发展。据“每日新闻”报道，在日本产业中占重要地位的钢铁业，最近又决定削价求售。
    为了缓和库存商品“过剩”的压力，日本从去年夏天就开始一再削减生产，平均有三分之一以上的生产设备没有开动。但是，即使是这样，库存“过剩”的现象还是无法改善。
    经济企划厅的5月份经济报告承认：目前的减产情况，从企业方面来看，已经在某种程度上到达极限。虽然如此，把日本经济引上死胡同的岸信介政府，还是一味要用削减生产的办法来解救生产“过剩”的危机。29日的内阁阁员会议决定，从6月份开始，煤的生产量要比原计划削减5％。同时，通商产业省决定“劝告”各纺织厂，在今年7月到9月继续实行目前的棉纱减产十分之三的规定。日本厂商说，如果政府不改变一向采取的减产政策，那末失业问题会更严重起来。
