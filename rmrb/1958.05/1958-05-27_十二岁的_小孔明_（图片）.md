Twelve-Year-Old "Little Zhuge Liang"

    Zhang Goudiu, a twelve-year-old Young Pioneer, is a "Little Zhuge Liang" who emerged in the tool reform movement in Changge County, Henan Province. The new tool he created—a hand-cranked single-wheel double-cylinder waterwheel—is highly praised by everyone.

    In the past two months, the tool reform movement launched by farmers in Changge County has received full support and encouragement from the county, township, and commune leaderships, achieving great results. The "Zhuge Liangs" among the masses, unlike in the beginning when they worked at night for fear of being laughed at, are now competing to come up with ideas and solutions, and studying together, forming a creative upsurge in which men, women, old, and young are all eager to become inventors. In this context, Zhang Goudiu, a young commune member from the Xinlu No. 2 Cooperative in Gangzhang Village, Chengguan Township, attracted the attention and concern of the commune members due to his usual hobby of tinkering with things and the intelligence he displayed in this area. When the township held a Zhuge Liang meeting, the commune members elected him to attend. Encouraged by everyone, Goudiu plucked up his courage to attend the meeting in the township. At the meeting, he worked hard to use his brain and actually tied a small new waterwheel model out of sorghum stalks. Everyone felt that the structure of this thing had some logic, so they praised him as a "Little Zhuge Liang." After the model was brought back to the cooperative, the commune cadres enthusiastically handed it over to the iron and woodworking shop for trial production and slight improvement. This new waterwheel was successfully manufactured. Its water lifting efficiency is at least ten mu of land that can be irrigated in a day.

    Goudiu's creation encouraged the commune members and himself as well. When the reporter left Gangzhang Village, he learned that he was continuing to work hard to research a new waterwheel that could be driven by wind power and also hand-cranked!

    十二岁的“小孔明”
    十二岁的少年先锋队员张狗丢，是河南省长葛县工具改革运动中出现的一个“小孔明”；他创造的新工具——手摇单轮双筒水车，很受大家的赞赏。
    在最近两个月中，长葛县农民掀起的工具改革运动，得到了县、乡和社的领导的充分支持和鼓励，取得很大的成绩。群众中的“诸葛亮”们，再不像开始时那样在夜晚干、怕人笑话了，而是人人赛着出主意、想办法，又互相研究，形成一种男女老少都愿争当发明家的创造热潮。在这种情况下，城关乡岗张村新路二社的小社员张狗丢，由于他平时爱扎弄个东西玩，他在这方面所表现的聪明，引起了社员们的关心和重视。当乡里有一次召开诸葛亮会的时候，社员们就举他去参加了。狗丢得到大家的鼓励，壮了胆到乡里开会，在会上他努力开动脑筋，用高粱秸竟扎出一个小小的新水车模型。大家一看觉得这东西的构造还有道理，就称赞他是个“小孔明”了。模型拿回社后，社干部热心的交给了铁木工场叫照着试制，略加改进，这部新水车就造成功了。它的提水效率最低一天能浇十亩地。
    狗丢的这次创造鼓舞了社员们，也鼓舞着他自己。当记者离开岗张村时，知道他正继续努力钻研着一种利用风力带动也可以用手摇的新水车哩！
