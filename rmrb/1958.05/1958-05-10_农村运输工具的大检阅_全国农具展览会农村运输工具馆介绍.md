In the great leap forward of agricultural production, rural transport tools have also undergone a great leap forward. The rural transport tools exhibited at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition are the result of improvements and innovations in the past one or two years, especially those made during the last winter and this spring to meet the needs of farmland water conservancy construction and manure accumulation and delivery. Due to the improvement and innovation of transport tools, farmers can free up millions of laborers to invest in manure accumulation, soil improvement, soil and water conservation, and improved cultivation techniques. The basic characteristic of the diverse rural transport tools is that vehicle transport replaces hard manual labor.

The exhibited transport tools have been improved and invented according to the specific conditions of various parts of China. Yunnan is a mountainous area, and the single-wheeled bamboo wheelbarrow created by farmers in Xiangyun County, Yunnan, is suitable for use on rugged mountain roads, increasing work efficiency by 1.5 times compared to manual carrying. It is simple to manufacture, light to push, and costs only three yuan, and has been promoted throughout Yunnan Province. The single-wheeled handcart improved by the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation has a body only five inches above the ground, making it stable and safe to push and easy to load and unload. A small wheel is installed at the front end of the longitudinal beam of the cart. When crossing a ditch, the small wheel crosses the ditch first as a support, and the large wheel can then pass over it. This type of cart has been promoted in Hunan, Jiangxi, and other places. The Beijing-made three-wheeled self-dumping cart can carry 400 kilograms. The frame is equipped with a self-dumping cart body, which is convenient for unloading soil and sand. It is light and easy to pedal, and is suitable for transporting soil, sand, and grain. The movable carriage two-wheeled handcart manufactured by the Hunan Provincial Department of Light Industry can be widened or narrowed, lengthened or shortened. When opened, it can load large and light goods, and when closed, it can transport sand and soil. This type of cart can carry 500 kilograms, increasing work efficiency by nine times compared to manual carrying. Ways to improve the existing 10 million rickshaws nationwide can be learned here, and new methods can also be learned for manufacturing new rickshaws in the future.

The improvement and creation of animal-powered vehicles are also diverse. The three-wheeled ox cart made by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Transportation can carry 1,000 kilograms. The shaft is long, making traction easier, and it is easy to drive without a rope sleeve. The wooden-wheeled rubber-belt self-unloading horse cart made by the Yunnan Provincial Department of Transportation Human and Animal-Powered Vehicle Experimental Factory has a pedal installed in the front of the cart. The driver only needs to step on the pedal to automatically dump the goods; each unloading takes only five seconds, increasing work efficiency by 60 times compared to ordinary horse carts. The two-wheeled passenger and cargo vehicle manufactured in Hebei can carry 1,500 kilograms and is suitable for rural manure delivery, grain transportation, and also for farmers to ride to the fields for production. Among the exhibits, there is an old-fashioned animal-powered vehicle, originally with wooden axles, wooden ears, and wooden wheels with iron edges. After improvement, the wooden axle is inlaid with an iron sleeve, the wooden ears are inlaid with iron tiles, the iron tile wheel on the wooden wheel edge is changed to a grooved counter-tile, and hard rubber is added. Equipped with caliper brakes, the load capacity of the vehicle is increased, the rolling resistance is reduced, it is safe on slopes, and the damage to the road is greatly reduced. If the existing 5 million animal-powered vehicles in rural areas across the country are improved, they can exert greater transportation efficiency.

This pavilion exhibits more than 50 different styles of ship models. The total length of rivers in China is more than 300,000 kilometers, of which more than 104,000 kilometers are navigable, and the transport capacity of professional wooden sailing ships is nearly 3 million tons. Shipbuilders and boatmen have improved sailing ships and motorized sailing ships in order to fully utilize water transportation. Wooden sailing ships have been improved to be suitable for towing or pushing by ships, or動力 engines are installed on wooden sailing ships. With wind, the sails are unfurled; without wind, the动力 is started. The motorized sailing ship improved by the Hunan Provincial Department of Transportation has a shallow draft and can travel in small tributary rivers, making it a good ship for solving transportation in mountainous and remote areas. The shallow-water climbing boat manufactured in Luohe, Henan, is suitable for the shallow and sandy characteristics of the province's rivers. It has a shallow draft, large load capacity, light boat bottom, simple structure, and low cost, and can carry 10 tons. The amphibious wooden boat manufactured in Guangdong has three wooden wheels installed at the head and rear of the boat bottom. When transporting in water, the three wheels are removed, and one person can row; when transporting on land, the three wheels are installed, and two people can pull or push to move. If there is no connection between ponds, the boat can be pushed from one pond to another.

In the transport tool pavilion, you can also see the beautiful vision of rural transport in China. There are various styles of domestically produced automobiles and motorized ships suitable for rural transport. The exhibited motor vehicles were mostly made by urban workers in support of agricultural production during the great leap forward in agricultural production, rushing to make them for peasant brothers. The "Yuejin Brand" truck, which was trial-produced in Nanjing in April of this year, can not only load 2,500 kilograms of cargo, but also tow 3,000 kilograms of cargo. This car has many advantages: it is light and flexible, fast, consumes less fuel, and has a low cost. The Liberation-type self-dumping truck and coal gas truck successfully trial-produced by the Changchun No. 1 Automobile Manufacturing Plant this year are also on display here. Coal gas trucks can use white coal, anthracite coal, coke, and charcoal as fuel, or gasoline. Because it uses many types of fuel and has a wide source, it can be widely used in rural areas. This type of coal gas car can carry 3,500 kilograms of cargo and can also tow a trailer with a load capacity of 2,000 kilograms. The domestically produced three-wheeled automobiles successfully trial-produced in Shanghai and Wuhu, Anhui, are small, light, and flexible. Various styles of trailers trial-produced and imitated in Beijing, Shenyang, and other places are also on display here. The self-propelled multi-purpose dredger manufactured in Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, can be used for rural dredging for manure accumulation, peat mining, river dredging, ditch excavation, irrigation, drainage, feed crushing, rice milling, and flour milling. Irrigation and drainage can transport 700 cubic meters of water per hour. Calculated at 200 loads per mu for manure accumulation, it can provide fertilizer for 70 mu of farmland per day. The 85-horsepower coal gas engine shallow-water tugboat manufactured in Jiangxi Province can tow barges or wooden sailing ships on the main and tributary rivers of the local area, traveling at 14 kilometers per hour. This type of ship has been promoted in Jiangxi. From these motorized vehicles and ships, we can see how China's industry is supporting agriculture, how close the relationship between workers and farmers is, and how consolidated the worker-peasant alliance is.

    农村运输工具的大检阅
    ——全国农具展览会农村运输工具馆介绍
    新华社记者　苏群
    在农业生产大跃进中，农村运输工具也来了个大跃进。全国农具展览会展出的农村运输工具是最近一、二年来改进和创造的，特别是去冬今春适应兴修农田水利和积肥、送肥的需要而改进和发明创造的最多。由于运输工具的改进和创造，农民就可以腾出千百万的劳动力，投到积肥、改良土壤、水土保持和改进耕作技术等工作中去。多种多样的农村运输工具的基本特点是，用车辆运输代替了辛勤的人背肩挑。
    展览的这些运输工具都是根据我国各地的具体条件改进和发明的。云南是一个多山的地区，云南祥云县农民创造的独轮竹兜手推车，适于山区崎岖小路使用，比人挑提高工效一倍半。制作简便，推动轻巧，造价只三元，已在云南全省推广。湖南省交通厅改良的独轮手推车，车身离地面只有五寸多，推动稳定安全，装卸方便。车子的纵梁前端，装有一个小轮，过沟时，小轮先过沟作为支点，大轮即可腾空而过。这种车子在湖南、江西等地已推广使用。北京制造的三轮自动倾卸车，能载重四百公斤。车架上装有自动倾卸车箱，卸土方便，蹬起来轻快省力，适于运送土和砂石，也适于运送粮食。湖南省轻工业厅制造的活动货厢双轮手推车，车厢能宽能窄，能长能短，放开可装体积大分量轻的货物，收拢可运送砂石和土。这种车能载五百公斤，比人挑提高工效九倍。全国现有的一千多万辆人力车怎样改进，可以从这里学到办法，今后制造新的人力车，也可学到新方法。
    兽力车的改进和创造也是多种多样的。广东省交通厅制的三轮牛车，能载重一千公斤。车辕长，牵引省力，不用绳套，驾驶方便。云南省交通厅人兽力车试验厂制的木轮胶带自动卸货马车，在车前部装有一踏板，赶车人在车上只要一踩踏板，货物就自动倒出来了；每卸一车只要五秒钟，比一般马车提高工效六十倍。河北制造的二轮客货两用车能载重一千五百公斤，适于农村送粪、运粮，还可供农民下地生产乘坐。在展品中有一种老式的兽力车，原是木轴、木耳、木轮铁边，经过改进后，木车轴镶有铁套，木车耳镶有铁瓦，木轮边上的铁瓦轮改为槽式反瓦，再加装硬胶皮，安上钳式制动器，车子的载重量大了，滚动阻力小了，上下坡安全，对道路的破坏作用大大减少了。全国农村现有的五百多万辆兽力车，如果加以改进，就可以发挥出更大的运输效力。
    这个馆里展出了五十多种式样不同的船的模型。我国河流总长三十多万公里，现可通航的有十万四千多公里，专业木帆船的运力近三百万吨。造船工人和船民们为了充分的利用水上运输，改进了帆船和机帆船。木帆船改进成适合轮船拖带或顶推的，或是在木帆船上装动力机，有风张帆，无风使动力开动。湖南省交通厅所改进的机帆船，吃水浅，能行驶于支流小河，是解决当前山区和偏僻地区运输的好船。河南漯河制造的浅水爬山虎船，适应该省河道水浅，沙多的特点，吃水浅、载重大，船底轻快，构造简单，造价低，可载十吨。广东制造的水陆两用木船，在船底的头部和后部装有三个木轮，在水中运输时，拆去了三个轮子，一个人就可以划行；在陆地运输时，装上三个轮子，用两个人拉或推就可以开动。遇着塘与塘不通的地方，可以推着船从这个塘到另一个塘里去。
    在运输工具馆里，还可以看到我国农村运输的美丽远景。有适合农村运输用的各种样式的国产汽车和机动轮船。展览的机动车辆，多是城市工人在农业生产大跃进中支援农业大生产，为农民兄弟赶制出来的。南京在今年4月份试制出厂的“跃进牌”载重汽车，除能装二千五百公斤货物外，还可拖挂三千公斤货物。这种汽车具备许多优点，轻便灵活，时速快，耗油少，造价低。长春第一汽车制造厂今年试制成功的解放型的自动倾卸车和煤汽载重汽车也在这里展出了。煤气载重车可以用白煤、无烟块煤、焦煤、木炭作燃料，也可以用汽油做燃料。由于它使用的燃料种类多，来源广，在农村可普遍使用。这种煤气汽车可载重三千五百公斤货物，还可挂一辆载重两千公斤的拖车。上海和安徽芜湖试制成功的国产三轮汽车，小巧，轻快，灵活。北京、沈阳等地试制和仿制的式样繁多的拖斗车，也在这里展出了。江苏镇江制造的自航多用挖泥船，可供农村挖泥积肥，开采泥炭，疏浚河道，开挖渠道，灌溉、排涝、粉碎饲料，碾米和磨粉等用。灌溉、排涝每小时可输水七百立方公尺，积肥按每亩二百担计算，每天可供七十亩农田用肥。江西省制造的八十五马力的煤气机浅水拖轮，在地方的内河干支流上均能拖带驳船或木帆船航行，每小时可航行十四公里，这种船已在江西推广使用。从这些机动的车辆和船舶可以看出我国工业是如何支援农业的，工人同农民的关系是如何密切，工农联盟是如何巩固。
