    A New Way to Train Intellectuals from the Working Class
    Tianjin No. 1 Cotton Mill Launches Part-Work, Part-Study School

    (Our dispatch) Our reporters Shi Jian and Zhu Zemin report: The Tianjin No. 1 State-owned Cotton Textile Factory held the opening ceremony for its part-work, part-study school on the 27th. This revolutionary measure of implementing part-work, part-study among workers has opened up a new avenue for training intellectuals from the working class in a faster, better, and more economical way.

    The fifty-plus students participating in this part-work, part-study school are all maintenance, upkeep, electrical, and mechanical workers from the factory's gauze workshop and other workshops. They all have more than five years of work experience, and most of them are experienced veteran technicians with rich technical and operational experience and a cultural level equivalent to that of a higher primary school graduate. In the future, they will spend two hours of their eight-hour workday studying culture, completing the middle school curriculum in three and a half years. In addition to studying Chinese, physics, chemistry, and mathematics for junior and senior high school, they will also study basic technical courses such as electrical engineering principles, drafting, and mechanical principles. The factory has also decided to gradually set up part-work, part-study classes in the spinning and weaving workshops.

    The part-work, part-study school was established to meet the requirements of the new situation of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution. Although more than two-thirds of the factory's total workforce had already participated in amateur cultural studies after liberation, and the workers' cultural and intellectual level had improved, workers could only study for six hours once or twice a week during their spare time, which could no longer fully meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in production. Workers yearned to accelerate the improvement of their cultural and technical level. As a result, many workers attended night school at the factory and also used their days off to go to drafting classes at the cultural palace to learn drafting. Yang Yunfa, a veteran roving frame maintenance worker, has been working as a maintenance worker for more than sixteen years since the age of thirteen. Because he had not studied mathematics, he could not calculate the construction of parts or the number of revolutions of machines, which caused many difficulties in his work. The workers in the electrical department were in great need of knowledge of trigonometry, geometry, and electrical engineering.

    In order to meet the urgent needs of workers to improve their cultural and technical level and to train intellectuals from the working class in a more decisive, faster, better, and more economical way, the factory's Party organization boldly conceived the idea of allocating two hours of work time for study and implementing part-work, part-study. At first, some leading cadres were afraid that part-work, part-study would disrupt the production order, that allocating two hours of work time would affect production, and that the issue of wages would be difficult to resolve, and so on. After research by the factory's Party committee, a public notice was posted to mobilize workers to discuss the matter. The workers were very happy to hear that they were going to implement part-work, part-study. Many people rearranged their work and tried to squeeze out time to participate in the study. Yan Chunting, a seventh-grade maintenance worker in the electrical department's electrical overhaul team, was originally afraid of affecting his work, but after a careful calculation, he realized that after properly arranging his day's work, allocating two hours would not be a big problem. Yang Yunfa, a roving frame maintenance worker who serves as a team leader, is relatively busy with his work, but he believes that as long as he arranges and deploys his work in advance the day before, does not waste working hours, and works harder during work, he can also participate in the study. Some workers even proposed "three no delays": no delay in production, no delay in study, and no delay in political study and social activities. Regarding the issue of wages, the factory leaders put forward a preliminary plan: generally, 75% of the wages will be paid during the two hours of cultural study, but old workers can still be considered with old treatment, and new workers with new treatment. After the workers' calculations, the monthly salary would only be reduced by 6.25%, which would not have a significant impact on the lives of most workers. Many workers said that in order to become intellectuals of the working class, they should look far ahead. According to everyone's calculations, the middle school curriculum, which originally took eight years to complete in workers' night school, would only take three and a half years in the part-work, part-study school. With the same eight years, the workers could reach the level of university graduation. The workers said, "At that time, our workers will truly be completely liberated."

    At the opening ceremony on the 27th, the persons in charge of the Education Department of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and other units all attended and spoke. They unanimously pointed out that the part-work, part-study school is a new direction for training intellectuals from the working class, encouraging everyone to overcome the difficulties in learning with the heroic spirit of the working class and strive to master more scientific and cultural knowledge in a short period of time.

    培养工人阶级知识分子的新途径
    天津国棉一厂举办半工半读学校
    本报讯　记者石坚、朱泽民报道：国营天津第一棉纺织厂举办的半工半读学校在27日举行了开学典礼。这个在工人中实行的半工半读的革命措施，为多快好省地培养工人阶级知识分子开创了一个新的途径。
    参加这个半工半读学校的五十多名学员都是这个工厂的纱布场等车间的保全、保养、电动、机械工人，他们都具备五年以上工龄，其中大部分是具有丰富技术和操作经验以及相当于高小毕业的文化水平的老技术工人。他们今后每天在八小时工作时间里抽出两小时学习文化，三年半的时间内学完中学课程。他们除了学习初中和高中的语文、物理、化学、数学以外，还要学习电工原理、制图、机械原理等基础技术课程。这个工厂还决定陆续在纺纱和织布车间举办半工半读学习班。
    半工半读学校是适应技术革命和文化革命新形势的要求举办的。这个工厂解放后虽然已经有占全厂职工总数三分之二以上的工人参加了业余文化学习，工人文化知识水平有所提高，但是工人们每周只能在一两次业余时间学习六小时，已不能充分满足生产大跃进的要求，工人们渴望加速提高文化和技术水平。于是，许多工人一方面在工厂上夜校，一方面又抽出休假日的时间到文化宫的制图班去学习制图。粗纱保全老师傅杨云发从十三岁起已经干了十六年多的保全工，因为没学过数学，要计算一下机件构造或是机器转数就算不上来，工作中有很多困难。电动部的工人们非常需要具备三角、几何以及电工方面的知识。
    为了满足工人提高文化和技术水平的迫切要求，多决好省地培养工人阶级知识分子，工厂的中共党组织大胆设想，决定在工作时间抽出两小时学习，实行半工半读。开始时，有些领导干部怕半工半读打乱了生产秩序，怕抽出两小时工作时间影响了生产，怕工资问题不好解决等等。经工厂党委会研究以后，公开贴了布告，发动工人进行讨论。工人们一听要搞半工半读，都非常欢迎。很多人重新安排了一下自己的工作，想办法挤出时间来参加学习。电动部电气大修组七级保全工阎春亭原来就怕影响工作，可是他一算细账，把自己一天工作妥善安排以后，抽出两小时来没有多大问题。粗纱保全工杨云发担任大组长，工作比较忙，但是他认为只要前一天提前把工作布置安排好，不浪费工时，在工作中再加把劲，也可以参加学习。有的工人还提出三不误：不误生产，不误学习，不误政治学习和社会活动。关于工资问题，工厂领导提出了一个初步方案：学文化的两小时内一般发工资的75％，但是还可以考虑老工人老待遇，新工人新待遇。经过工人们计算，每月工资不过减少6.25％，对于大部分工人的生活不会有多大影响。许多工人都表示，为了使自己成为工人阶级知识分子，眼光应该往远看。经过大家计算，原来在工人夜校里要八年才学完的中学课程，在半工半读学校里只要三年半就够了。同样用八年的时间，工人们就可以达到大学毕业的水平。工人们说：“到那时候，我们工人真是彻底翻身了。”
    在27日的开学典礼上，中共天津市委员会教育部、市工会联合会等单位的负责人都到会讲了话，他们一致指出：半工半读学校是一个培养工人阶级知识分子的新方向，勉励大家用工人阶级的豪迈气魄克服学习中的困难，争取在短时间内掌握更多的科学文化知识。
