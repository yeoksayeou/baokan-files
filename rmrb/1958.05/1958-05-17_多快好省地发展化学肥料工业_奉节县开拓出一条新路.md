People's Daily, Chengdu, 16th: Reporter Liu Zongtang and Wang Huandou report: Fengjie County, Sichuan Province, displaying a spirit of originality, relying on the masses, and self-reliantly, has recently, within four months, successfully trial-produced ammonium sulfate, ammonium bicarbonate, and ferrous sulfate using indigenous methods. More than a hundred agricultural cooperatives have now established factories to produce them. The entire county will soon achieve a state where every cooperative runs a fertilizer factory and every household produces fertilizer, with an annual output of 8,000 to 10,000 tons of various fertilizers, averaging twenty catties per mu of cultivated land. This significant innovation and initiative has opened up a new path for developing the chemical fertilizer industry in a faster, better, and more economical way in our country. By the end of April, more than six hundred representatives from eighteen provinces nationwide had rushed here to visit and learn.

　　The three types of fertilizers made by Fengjie County are extracted from local waste materials, with low costs, high quality, simple production equipment, easy operation, and abundant raw material sources, enabling rapid and large-scale production. The first successfully trial-produced ammonium sulfate is extracted from the sulfur residue of sulfur factories, with a nitrogen content of around 20%, close to the national first and second-grade product levels. The cost is three cents per catty. Only a few wooden buckets and iron pots are needed to extract thirty-five catties of ammonium sulfate from one hundred catties of sulfur residue. Someone completely unfamiliar with the technology can learn to manufacture it in six or seven days. Fengjie is one of the important sulfur-producing areas in Sichuan Province. Based on the existing three sulfur factories alone, more than 2,600 tons of ammonium sulfate can be produced this year by utilizing sulfur residue.

　　Recently, the county has discovered new sources of raw materials for manufacturing this fertilizer, namely, extracting more ammonium sulfate from coal gangue (coal refuse) and sulfur gangue (sulfur low-grade ore). The output of these two materials far exceeds that of sulfur residue.

　　Ferrous sulfate is extracted from the waste ore slag discarded by sulfur factories. In addition to being used as fertilizer, it can also kill insects. The manufacturing method is easy to understand, and the cost is very low.

　　The most valuable for promotion is ammonium bicarbonate. It is recovered from the waste gas of coal-burning lime kilns. The ammonium bicarbonate successfully trial-produced in Fengjie County contains 17.7% nitrogen, has high fertility, and has a faster fertilizer effect, with even more advantages than ammonium sulfate. The production method is as simple as that of ammonium sulfate. Just set up a few earthenware pipes and iron buckets next to the lime kiln to start production. A lime kiln can recover three catties and four taels of ammonium bicarbonate for every thousand catties of coal burned. The raw material source of ammonium bicarbonate is even wider. Wherever coal is burned, such as lime kilns, brick kilns, ceramic kilns, sugar boiling, winemaking, and even household coal stoves, it can be recovered. Fengjie County alone has more than a thousand lime kilns, with one to several in each agricultural cooperative. This item alone can produce more than two thousand tons of ammonium bicarbonate annually.

　　According to the county's preliminary plan, using this indigenous method, fertilizer production will increase to 50,000 tons by 1962, equivalent to one hundred catties per mu of cultivated land.

　　The initiative to manufacture fertilizers using indigenous methods appeared in Fengjie County mainly because they broke away from the mysterious view of science and technology and liberated their thinking. In the past, although the county urgently needed chemical fertilizers, and various places within its borders were rich in raw materials for manufacturing fertilizers such as coal and sulfur, they had never thought of manufacturing fertilizers themselves. They believed that only large factories, large cities, automated machinery, and mechanization could manufacture chemical fertilizers, and they could not do it themselves. After the encouragement of the rectification movement and the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program, especially inspired by the general line for building socialism proposed by the Party Central Committee, the county Party committee re-considered these issues: Can we produce fertilizers ourselves? How to produce them? The county Party secretary personally took charge, went deep into factories and mines to conduct fertilizer trial production experiments in the experimental fields, and at the same time, widely mobilized the masses to produce using indigenous methods and simple methods. The county only had three young lab technicians with secondary education, seven or eight technicians from worker backgrounds, twenty thousand workers who had just come from the countryside, and several manually operated factories and mines. Therefore, at the beginning, some people said: "What are you relying on to manufacture fertilizers? It's just wishful thinking and a waste of time." However, because the county Party committee closely relied on the masses, boldly created, worked hard, and studied assiduously, the progress of the experiment completely exceeded the expectations of the conservatives. The work progressed very smoothly, and many difficulties were overcome. For example, if there were no test tubes in the experiment, they used two iron pipes connected together to make a test tube; if there was no clarification equipment, they used earthen vats instead. Under the leadership of the county Party committee, the Fengjie Sulfur Factory, after six repeated experiments, finally extracted ammonium sulfate from sulfur residue using indigenous methods. This incident profoundly educated the broad masses of people and made many people break the superstition that science and technology are out of reach. Then, the county Party committee immediately organized workers and staff of various factories and mines to discuss: Can other fertilizers be produced in large quantities using indigenous methods? Through discussion, the confidence of the masses became higher and higher, and the enthusiasm became greater and greater. A competition movement for trial production of fertilizers using indigenous methods was launched throughout the county. Two thousand factory and mine workers, from factory directors to workers, from technicians to clerks and accountants, were all involved in the upsurge of trial-producing fertilizers. Many government officials also participated. The vast majority of factories and mines and some government agencies set up small laboratories and established experimental groups. Many workers discussed the secrets of trial production in groups of three or five after work, often working until late at night before going to rest. In this way, one after another, the ways to manufacture fertilizers using indigenous methods were researched. At present, the mass movement of manufacturing fertilizers using indigenous methods here is still continuing to surge, and the results are constantly expanding.

　　多快好省地发展化学肥料工业
　　奉节县开拓出一条新路
    本报成都16日电　记者刘宗棠、王焕斗报道：四川省奉节县发扬独创精神，依靠群众，自力更生，最近四个月内接连用土法试制成功了硫酸铵、炭酸氢铵、硫酸亚铁等三种化学肥料。现在已有一百多个农业社设厂生产，全县不久即将做到社社办化肥厂，户户生产化肥，年内生产各种化肥八千吨到一万吨，平均每亩耕地二十斤。这个重大的革新创举，为我国多快好省地发展化学肥料开辟了一个新途径。到4月底止，全国已有十八个省六百多个代表赶到这里参观学习。
    奉节县制成的三种化肥都是从当地的废物中提取出来的，成本低，质量高，生产的设备简单，操作容易、原料来源充足，能很快地大量生产。最早试制成功的硫酸铵是从硫磺厂的硫磺脚渣中提取的，含氮量在20％左右，接近国家一、二级产品的水平。每斤成本三分钱。只需要买几个木桶和铁锅就能从一百斤硫磺脚渣中提取三十五斤硫酸铵。一个完全不懂技术的人在六、七天内就能学会制造。奉节是四川省重要硫磺的产地之一，仅根据现有的三个硫磺厂统计，今年利用硫磺脚渣就能生产硫酸铵二千六百多吨。
    最近这个县又发现了制造这种化肥原料的新来源，即从煤夹子（煤?石）和磺夹子（磺贫矿）里提取更多的硫酸铵。这两种物资的产量都远远超过硫磺脚渣。
    硫酸亚铁是从硫磺厂弃置的矿渣中提制出来的。它除能作肥料外，还能杀虫，制造方法一看就会，成本也很低。
    推广价值最大的要算炭酸氢铵。它是从烧煤的石灰窑的废气中回收的。奉节县试制成功的炭酸氢铵，含氮17.7％，肥力大，肥效快，比硫酸铵的优点更多。制作方法和硫酸铵一样简单，只要在石灰窑旁设置几个土陶器管子和铁桶，便可开工生产。一座石灰窑每烧一千斤煤，即可回收三斤四两炭酸氢铵。炭酸氢铵的原料来源更广，凡是烧煤炭的地方，如石灰窑、砖瓦窑、陶瓷窑、熬糖、酿酒、甚至家庭使用的煤灶都能回收。奉节县仅石灰窑就有一千多处，每个农业社都有一个到几个，只此一项每年就可生产炭酸氢铵二千多吨。
    据这个县初步规划，就用这种土办法，到1962年化肥产量将提高到五万吨，每亩耕地合一百斤。
    用土办法制造化肥的创举所以出现在奉节县，主要是他们打破了对待科学技术的神秘观点，解放了思想。过去这个县虽然迫切需要化学肥料，境内各地又盛产煤炭、硫磺等制造化肥的原料，但是他们却从没有想过自己制造化肥。他们认为只有大工厂大城市、自动化机械化才能制造化学肥料，自己办不到。经过整风运动和农业发展纲要四十条的鼓舞，特别是党中央提出的建设社会主义总路线的启发，县委才重新考虑了这些问题：能不能自己生产化肥？怎样生产？县委书记亲自挂帅，深入到厂矿搞试制化肥的试验田，同时广泛发动群众用土办法、穷办法生产。全县只有三个具有中等文化水平的青年化验员，七、八个工人出身的技师，两万个刚从农村来的工人和几个手工操作的厂矿。因此，开始的时候，有的人说：“你们凭啥子制造化肥，真是异想天开，浪费时间。”但是，由于县委紧密依靠群众，大胆创造，刻苦钻研，试验进行情况完全出乎保守者的意外。工作进行得很顺利，许多困难都被克服了。如在试验中没有试管，他们用两根铁管接起来就成试管；没有澄清设备，就用土缸代替。奉节硫磺厂在县委领导下，经过六次反复试验，终于用土法从硫磺脚渣中提炼出硫酸铵来。这件事，深刻地教育了广大群众，使许多人破除了科学技术高不可攀的迷信。接着，县委又立即组织各厂矿职工讨论：能不能用土法大量生产其他化肥？通过讨论，群众的信心越来越高、劲头越来越大，全县范围内掀起了一个用土法试制化肥的竞赛运动。两万名厂矿职工，从厂长到工人，从技术员到文书、会计，都卷入了试制化肥的热潮，许多机关干部也参加了。绝大多数的厂矿和部分机关都设置了小型试验室，成立了试验小组。许多工人下班后三五成群探讨试制窍门，常常工作到深夜才去休息。就是这样，土法制造化肥的门路一个接一个被钻研出来。目前这里群众性的土法制造化肥浪潮，还在继续高涨，战果不断扩大。
