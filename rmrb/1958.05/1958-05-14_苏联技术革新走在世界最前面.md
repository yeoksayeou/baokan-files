　　Soviet Technological Innovation Leads the World
　　First to build an automatic adjustment system for controlling production processes
　　The first "automated" driver has been tested and completed on the railway
　　Using hundreds of automated production lines for machining

    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 13th: According to TASS, Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Planning Committee of the Soviet Union, Kuzmin, said at the All-Soviet Conference of Industrial Workers on the 12th that the Soviet Union ranks first in the world in terms of the growth rate of labor productivity. In the future, its labor productivity will develop at an even faster pace. It will establish completely new forms and high-quality production processes, and implement measures in technology and production organization that can increase labor productivity not by a few percent or tens of percent, but by several times.
    The All-Soviet Conference of Industrial Workers opened on the 12th in the Moscow Kremlin. The conference will discuss the development of comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes, as well as the issue of increasing the production of instruments and automation tools. Soviet Communist Party and government leaders Aristov, Brezhnev, Kozlov, and Khrushchev attended the conference. Kozlov, entrusted by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, delivered the opening speech.
    Kuzmin delivered a report at the meeting on the tasks of developing comprehensive mechanization and automation of production processes in the Soviet Union.
    Kuzmin pointed out that the proportion of Soviet industrial output in the world's total industrial output has increased from 2%-3% in 1917 to 20%. The economic and technological policies of the Soviet Communist Party are: to continuously carry out technological innovations, improve labor organization and production technology procedures, and comprehensively mechanize and automate production processes in order to rapidly increase labor productivity. He said that according to the calculations of the Soviet State Planning Committee, 80% of the increased industrial products in the Soviet Union in 1965 will be obtained through increasing labor productivity.
    Kuzmin said that by the beginning of 1958, Soviet machine-building factories had centrally manufactured one hundred and fifty machine tool production lines. In addition, some enterprises have used their own strength to manufacture nearly two hundred automated production lines using existing machine tools. According to preliminary statistics, by 1965, the Soviet Union plans to produce 1,400 sets of automated production lines for the metal processing industry and more than 350 sets of automated production lines for the wood processing industry. In addition, industrial enterprises will use their own strength to manufacture many automated production lines for themselves.
    Kuzmin said that the use of new automated systems controlled by electronics has opened up broad prospects for production automation. He said that the Soviet Union was the first to build the first automatic adjustment system for automatically controlling production processes. The world's first automated "driver" will soon be tested and completed at the Moscow railway hub station. This automated "driver" can automatically control the train according to the prescribed schedule without a train driver, but it can complete higher indicators than the most experienced train driver. The Soviet Union has also developed the world's first automated machine for determining the best operating system for exploiting oil and gas fields. In addition, it has also used radioactive isotopes and opto-acoustic principles to develop new tools for automatically adjusting the composition of substances.
    Kuzmin said that the Soviet Union plans to increase the production of industrial control instruments and automation tools ninefold by 1959 compared with 1955. It plans to build 39 new factories and renovate 17 factories that manufacture these products. It is expected that by 1965, the output of Soviet automation tools will be more than four times this year's output.

　　苏联技术革新走在世界最前面
　　最先建成了操纵生产过程的自动调整系统
　　第一个“自动化”司机即在铁路上试验完成
　　使用着成百套机器加工用的自动化作业线
    新华社13日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议副主席、苏联国家计划委员会主席库兹明12日在全苏工业工作人员会议上说，苏联在劳动生产率的增长速度方面居世界第一位。将来它的劳动生产率还将以更快的速度发展。它将要建立完全新形式的、质量很高的生产过程，在技术和生产组织方面实现能够把劳动生产率不是提高百分之几或百分之几十而是提高几倍的措施。
    全苏工业工作人员会议是12日在莫斯科克里姆林宫开幕的。会议将讨论关于生产过程全面机械化和自动化的发展以及增加仪器和自动化工具生产的问题。苏联共产党和政府的领导人阿里斯托夫、勃列日?夫、科兹洛夫和赫鲁晓夫参加了会议。科兹洛夫受苏共中央和苏联部长会议的委托致了开幕词。
    库兹明在会上作了关于在苏联发展生产过程全面机械化和自动化的任务的报告。
    库兹明指出，目前，苏联工业产量在全世界工业总产量中所占的比重已经由1917年的2％—3％提高到20％。苏联共产党的经济政策和技术政策就是：不断地进行技术革新、使劳动组织和生产技术程序趋于完善、使生产过程全面机械化和自动化，以迅速提高劳动生产率。他说，据苏联国家计划委员会计算，1965年苏联增加的工业产品将有80％通过提高劳动生产率来获得。
    库兹明说，到1958年初，苏联机器制造工厂集中制造了一百五十套机床作业线。此外，一些企业还利用本企业现有机床用自己的力量制造了近二百套自动化作业线。据初步统计，到1965年，苏联计划将生产一千四百套供金属加工工业用的自动化作业线，三百五十多套供木材加工工业用的自动化作业线。此外，各工业企业还将用本企业的力量为自己制造许多自动化作业线。
    库兹明说，利用由电子操纵的全新的自动化系统，为生产自动化开辟了广阔的远景。他说，苏联最先建成了第一套自动化操纵生产过程的自动调整系统。世界上第一个自动化“司机”即将在莫斯科铁路枢纽站试验完成，这个自动化“司机”可以根据规定的运行表自动操纵列车而不要火车司机，但是它能完成的指标却比最有经验的火车司机还要高。苏联还制成了世界上第一个测定开采油田和煤气田的最好的工作制度的自动化机器。此外，它还利用放射性同位素和光学声学原理制成了自动调整物质成分的新工具。
    库兹明说，苏联计划在1959年使工业用控制仪器和自动化工具的生产比1955年增加九倍。它计划新建三十九个和改建十七个制造这类产品的工厂。预计到1965年，苏联自动化工具的产量将比今年增加四倍以上。
