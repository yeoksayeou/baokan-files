    Even if it's delivered to your door, you still have to invite them in

    Recently, many performing arts groups have been bringing their shows directly to the doorstep; cultural relics workers have proposed bringing文物 (cultural relics) to the doorstep for exhibitions; and not long ago, the 美协 (Fine Arts Association) also organized exhibitions in the suburbs of Beijing. This is a good trend.
    The so-called bringing it to the doorstep definitely isn't just about performing a few songs. It also means helping them establish amateur art organizations, teaching them some programs, and imparting some artistic knowledge, etc. We must also take away some gifts that they give "in return" -- class consciousness, folk art, and the criticisms of the masses, etc. This also relates to inviting them in.
    After the anti-Rightist struggle began last year, some universities invited workers and peasants to give lectures at the school. This can be said to be the beginning of inviting them in. I hope this can continue. And open more doors and invite more people. Not just the doors of universities, or the doors of literary associations, but also the doors of government offices, the doors of theaters, the doors of factories, and even the doors of cadres' homes. Invite them to give lectures, perform, watch performances, visit, and chat. I think this is also an auxiliary method for literature and art to serve the workers, peasants and soldiers, and for literary and art workers to transform themselves.

### 送上门，也要请进门

    送上门，也要请进门

    近来很多演出单位，把节目送上了门去演出；文物工作者提出倡议，要把文物送到门上去展览；前不久美协也在京郊组织展览。这是一种好风气。
    所谓送上门，绝不是演演唱唱了之。而是要帮助他们建立业余文艺组织，教会他们一些节目，传授一些艺术常识等。也要带走他们给“回”上的一些礼物——阶级意识、民间艺术、群众的批评等。这也就联系到请进门了。
    去年反右斗争开始后，有些大学请了工人、农民到学校去讲演，这可以说是请进门的开始。希望能够继续请下去。并且多开一些门，多请一些人。不尽限于大学之门，文联之门，而且也要请进机关之门，剧院之门，工厂之门，甚至干部的家门。请他们来讲演，演出，看演出参观和谈天。我觉得，这也是文艺为工农兵服务和文艺工作者自我改造的一种辅助的方法。
