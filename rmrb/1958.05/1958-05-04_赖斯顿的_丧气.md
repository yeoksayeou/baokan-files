    Reston's "Despair"
    Reston, the "New York Times" reporter famous for his familiarity with Washington's inside stories, wrote in a recent Washington dispatch entitled "The Decline of the West": "What is most distressing to the diplomatic community here is not the deadlock in the US-Soviet high-level talks, but the development trends of a series of economic and political events throughout the non-communist world..." Then, the reporter listed some facts about the "decline of the West": in addition to the United States, Canada, Chile, Brazil, and Colombia are also facing serious economic crises, France's twenty-fifth post-war cabinet is in difficult birth, the British Labor Party fiercely opposes the British government's diplomatic policy of following the United States step by step, and Japan's centrifugal force to get rid of American control in foreign trade is strengthening...
    The reporter describes the scene he portrays as a "depressing picture." However, people can tell Mr. Reston: even more "depressing" things are yet to come! Because the trend of "Western decline" is increasing; and the American lackeys who have different hearts from the United States are more than just Britain and Japan.

    赖斯顿的“丧气”
    以熟悉华盛顿内幕驰名的“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿最近在一篇题为“西方的衰落”的华盛顿通讯中写道：“使这里的外交界感到最苦恼的还不是美苏在高级会谈上的僵局，而是遍及非共产主义世界各地的一系列经济和政治事件的发展趋势……”接着这位记者就列举了一些“西方衰落”的事实：除了美国以外，加拿大、智利、巴西和哥伦比亚等国也面临着严重的经济危机，法国战后第二十五届内阁在难产中，英国工党激烈反对英国政府在外交政策上对美国亦步亦趋，日本在对外贸易方面想摆脱美国羁绊的离心力正在加强……
    这位记者把自己描绘出来的景象，称为“令人丧气的图画”。但是，人们可以奉告赖斯顿先生：更“令人丧气”的事情还在后面呢！因为，“西方衰落”的趋势正在有加无已；而对美国心怀离贰的美国小伙计，岂止英日两国而已。
