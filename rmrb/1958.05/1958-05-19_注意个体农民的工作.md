　　Pay Attention to the Work of Individual Farmers
    It is a very good thing that Minhou County, Fujian Province, has absorbed individual farmers in rural areas who are willing to join cooperatives into agricultural cooperatives. Now, it is necessary and possible in other regions to properly handle this issue.
    We say it is necessary because after the high tide of agricultural cooperativization across the country, there are still some individual farmers in various places. Most of the land they cultivate is distributed like "isolated islands" in the middle of agricultural cooperative farmlands, affecting the cooperative's unified land adjustment and implementation of large-scale technical reforms.
    We say it is possible because, after several years of practical education from the vast number of agricultural cooperatives' annual increase in production and income, and the education of the All-People Rectification Movement, the socialist consciousness of individual farmers has improved to varying degrees. The vast majority of them are actively demanding to join the cooperatives and join the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, this is a favorable time. We hope that, based on the new situation in rural areas today, and on the basis of full ideological education and complete voluntariness, all localities will absorb individual farmers into cooperatives as early as possible and organize them into the ranks of the Great Leap Forward.

### 注意个体农民的工作

　　注意个体农民的工作
    福建闽侯县把农村中愿意参加合作社的个体农民都吸收入农业社，这是一件很好的事。现在，在其他地区也有必要和可能来适当处理这个问题了。
    我们说它是必要，因为全国农业合作化高潮后，各地还有一些个体农民。他们耕种的土地大多像“孤岛”似地分布在农业社田园中间，影响了合作社统一进行土地调整和实行大规模的技术改革。
    我们说它可能，是因为经过几年来广大农业社年年增产增收的实际教育，和全民整风运动的教育，个体农民的社会主义觉悟都有不同程度的提高，他们当中绝大多数都积极要求参加合作社，投入集体大跃进的队伍。所以，这是一个有利的时机。我们希望各地根据今天农村新形势，在充分进行思想教育和完全自愿的基础上，把个体农民及早吸收入合作社，组织进大跃进的队伍。
