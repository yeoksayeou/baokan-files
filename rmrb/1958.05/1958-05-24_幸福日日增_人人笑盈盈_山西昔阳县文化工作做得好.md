    Happiness Increases Daily, Everyone Smiles
    Shanxi's Xiyang County Does a Good Job in Cultural Work
    (By our newspaper) In recent years, mass cultural and artistic activities in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have greatly developed under the leadership of the local Party and government. Currently, the county has developed 350 clubs, all of which have been consolidated. In addition, 183 amateur theater troupes, 194 creative writing groups, 259 clapper talk groups, as well as storytelling groups, singing teams, slide projection teams, yangko dance teams, libraries, etc., have been developed, and more than 6,800 rural cultural leadership backbones and various professional talents have been trained.
    Amateur cultural and artistic activities have become an indispensable part of the daily life of farmers in Xiyang County. Cadres also regard clubs as a treasure for promoting work, and their feedback is: to find ways to do a good job, seek advice in the clubs. Farmers not only use club activities to open their minds, learn culture, and learn technology, but even find the clubs to hold weddings. This year, 28 couples in the county held weddings in the clubs.
    The County Party Committee recognizes that whether mass cultural activities are carried out well or not is directly related to whether production tasks can be completed smoothly. Therefore, the County Party Committee paid attention to the leadership of mass cultural work from the very beginning, and criticized the two erroneous ideas among cadres of neglecting cultural work and engaging in recreational activities in isolation from production. In order to better lead cultural work, the County Party Committee requires Party committees at all levels to adopt the method of secretaries taking action and dedicated personnel being responsible for leading rural cultural work, and to include cultural education and art work on the Party organization's agenda, and to conduct regular inspections and research. The County Party Committee and Party committees at all levels directly grasp the planning, organization and ideological work of the clubs, and absorb the heads of cultural centers to attend necessary meetings.
    In leading rural cultural work, the County Party Committee resolutely implemented the policy of serving politics and serving production. The busier the production and central work, the more it used clubs to carry out small and diverse activities to conduct publicity and mobilization, achieving "where production goes, where the masses go, and where cultural activities follow." Now, in the great leap forward in agricultural production since spring, many clubs have achieved "model workers emerge in the morning, propaganda is done in the morning; model workers emerge in the morning, they are put on the blackboard in the afternoon; model workers emerge in the afternoon, slide shows are performed at night." Through various methods, praise and criticism are carried out in a timely manner, establishing righteousness and inspiring production enthusiasm. This spring, when Zhao Bi Village was repairing the land, some people lacked enthusiasm. The creative writing group compiled the clapper talk about the example of the old man Wang Juyin's active production: "Wang Juyin is sixty-seven, although he is old, he is really active. He goes to the fields earlier every day, and he also brings fertilizer to the fields. He is really energetic for the commune and the family, surpassing the old Huang Zhong of the Three Kingdoms." Wang Baixiao, who had always been poor at labor, heard this clapper talk and dug up 120 loads of soil that day, breaking the commune's record.
    While leading rural cultural work, the County Party Committee also paid attention to the collaboration and cooperation between various departments and systems.

### 幸福日日增　人人笑盈盈  山西昔阳县文化工作做得好

    幸福日日增　人人笑盈盈
    山西昔阳县文化工作做得好
    本报讯　几年来，山西省昔阳县的群众文化艺术活动在当地党政的领导下，有了很大的发展。目前，全县俱乐部已发展到三百五十个，并已全部巩固。此外，还发展了业余剧团一百八十三个、创作组一百九十四个、快板组二百五十九个以及说唱组、歌咏队、幻灯组、秧歌队、图书室等，并且培养了农村文艺领导骨干和各种业务人才六千八百多人。
    业余文化艺术活动已经成为昔阳全县农民日常生活中不可缺少的一部分。干部们也把俱乐部当成推动工作的一宝，他们的反映是：做好工作寻门路，俱乐部里找参谋。农民们不但通过俱乐部活动来开脑筋、学文化、学技术，就连结婚也找到俱乐部来了，今年全县在俱乐部办喜事的就有二十八对。
    县委认识到群众文艺活动开展得好与坏，是直接关系到生产任务能否顺利完成的一个重要条件。因此，县委在一开始就注意了对群众文化工作的领导，并且批判了干部中轻视文化工作和不结合生产孤立搞文娱活动的两种错误思想。为了更好地领导文化工作，县委要求各级党委采取书记动手、专人负责的办法领导农村文化工作，并将文化教育、艺术工作列入党组织的议事日程，定期检查研究。县委和各级党委都直接抓俱乐部的计划、组织工作和思想工作，并吸收文化馆负责人列席必要的会议。
    县委在领导农村文化工作中，坚决贯彻了为政治、为生产服务的方针，生产和中心工作越忙，就越通过俱乐部开展小型多样的活动来进行宣传鼓动，做到了“生产到哪里，群众到哪里，文艺活动就跟到哪里”。如今春以来农业生产大跃进中，许多俱乐部做到“早上出模范，上午就宣传；上午出模范，下午上黑板；下午出模范，晚上幻灯演。”通过各种方式及时进行表扬和批评，树立了正气，鼓舞了生产热情。赵壁村今年春天修地时，有些人干劲不足，创作组便把老汉王聚银积极生产的事例编了快板：“王聚银六十七，虽然年老真积极，每天下地数他早，上地还要把肥捎，为社为家真有劲，赛过三国老黄忠”。一贯劳动不好的王白小听了这首快板，当天就出土一百二十担，突破全社纪录。
    县委在领导农村文化工作的同时，还注意到各部门、各系统之间的协作和配合。
