Planting Tree Proverbs

△ Willows and poplars are planted on river滩(beaches/banks), elms and apricots on the hillside. (Shaanxi)

△ Plant green poplars in sand, willows in mud, and creeping willows in rock crevices. (Shandong)

△ Hoe the trees seven times and they will grow into a forest; hoe the cotton seven times and it will be as white as silver. (Hunan)

△ Oil tea trees don't need fertilizer; a layer of pine needles is enough each year. (Hunan)

△ Artemisia arenaria and sand willow are not afraid of sand; the more Artemisia arenaria is suppressed, the more vigorous it becomes, and the more sand willow is buried, the longer it grows. (Shaanxi)
(Note: This proverb reflects the experience of the people of northern Shaanxi in fighting against wind and sand: Planting Artemisia arenaria and sand willow can fix shifting sand.)
