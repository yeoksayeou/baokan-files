    Universal Projection Microscope
    China's first universal projection microscope has recently been successfully trial-produced in Suzhou and named the "Dongfeng Brand 58-4 Universal Projection Microscope."
    This projection microscope uses the principle of refraction and reflection on an ordinary microscope and is equipped with components for magnifying and projecting images, so that the magnified image can be clearly presented on a circular silver screen. Its magnification power is 5,000 times. At the same time, it can project the image onto a screen like a slide projector, in this way, the magnification power can reach more than 9,000 times.
    This projection microscope has the characteristics of various microscopes such as metallographic, polarizing, microbial, and phase contrast. It can be widely used in medicine, scientific research, and teaching. In addition, it can also be used to inspect the quality of industrial products and to identify ores in geological exploration.
    This microscope was jointly produced by the Physics Workshop of Jiangsu Normal College, Suzhou Optical Factory, and Suzhou Hardware Foundry Cooperative. These units have now transferred personnel to form a local state-owned optical instrument factory, preparing for mass production.

    万能投影显微镜
    我国第一架万能投影显微镜，最近在苏州试制成功，并命名为“东风牌58—4型万能投影显微镜”。
    这种投影显微镜在普通显微镜上运用折光反射原理，装置放大射影的机件，使放大后的影像能清楚地呈现在一块园形的银屏上。它的放大能力为五千倍，同时，它还可以像放幻灯似地，把影像射到银幕上，这样，放大能力可达到九千倍以上。
    这种投影显微镜具有金相、偏光、微生物、位相差等各种显微镜的特点。可用于医药、科学研究及教学方面广泛应用外，还可以检查工业产品的质量，以及地质勘察上用以鉴定矿石等。
    这架显微镜是江苏师范学院物理工场、苏州眼镜厂、苏州市五金翻砂合作社等方面协作制成的。现在这些单位已抽调力量组成了地方国营光学仪器厂，准备大批生产。
