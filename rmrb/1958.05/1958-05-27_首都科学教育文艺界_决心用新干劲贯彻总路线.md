Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Beijing's science, education, and art circles, upon hearing the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, were greatly encouraged and resolved to implement the Party's general line for the period of socialist construction with renewed zeal.

茅以升 (Mao Yisheng), Vice Chairman of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization and Deputy Director of the Technical Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "The 'Eighth National Congress' put forward the task of a nationwide technological revolution and cultural revolution, which I found incredibly exciting! Facing the great leap forward in production and the great liberation of thought across the country, and now with a technological revolution and cultural revolution, our country's scientific endeavors will surely also make a great leap forward. The broad masses' superstition towards science will also be liberated. With the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the people across the country, our country's scientific and technological level will certainly catch up with and surpass the international advanced level in a very short period of time."

叶渚沛 (Ye Zhubei), Director of the Institute of Chemical Metallurgy of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is currently conducting research on intensifying the blast furnace ironmaking process and converter oxygen steelmaking. Upon seeing the news of the closing of the "Eighth National Congress," he excitedly told reporters that he believed the time it would take for our country's steel and iron production and quality to catch up with the level of England would be greatly reduced to less than fifteen years. His research involves using a pressure of ten atmospheres and hot air at a temperature of 1250 degrees Celsius to intensify blast furnace ironmaking. This is a new problem that has not been encountered in the world. Using this method of ironmaking can double production.

The young researchers of the polymer chemistry group at the Institute of Chemistry, before the announcement of the closing of the "Eighth National Congress," had already heard about the spirit of the "Eighth National Congress" at the Communist Youth League Congress of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and their leaping enthusiasm was further increased. The originally advanced leap forward plan will now be completed even earlier. The original plan to solve the production problems of organosilicon (silicon) rubber and silicone paint in two years and catch up with the United States in five years. Later, at the Communist Youth League Congress of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, they proposed to solve the production problems before "May Day" next year and catch up with the United States in two years.

Universities and colleges in the capital are conducting debates on the two roads in teaching and scientific research in accordance with the spirit of the general line, in order to establish new teaching content and new teaching methods on this basis. Renmin University of China has dispatched more than sixty teachers and students to industrial departments in Tianjin, Harbin, Tangshan and other cities to participate in the rectification movement and understand the innovations made by various advanced industrial departments in management. Some departments have already begun to break the old and outdated teaching systems and are gradually establishing new teaching systems in accordance with the requirements of the general line. The teachers of the Department of Water Conservancy at Tsinghua University have also begun to improve their teaching in accordance with the principle of "simultaneously developing central and local industries, and simultaneously developing large and small enterprises."

The general line has also given great encouragement to the cultural and artistic circles in Beijing. More than one hundred well-known writers and artists in Beijing are going deep into the lives of the workers at the Ming Tombs construction site, engaging in labor training and creative activities. Representatives of cultural departments from various provinces and cities held a meeting in Beijing starting from the 25th to discuss how to develop the socialist film industry in a faster, better, and more economical way in accordance with the Party's general line for the period of socialist construction. The meeting proposed to put politics in command, liberate thinking, decentralize powers, pool the wisdom of the masses, and strive to gradually achieve "every province has a film studio, every county has a cinema, and every township has a projection team" within five to ten years.

    首都科学教育文艺界
    决心用新干劲贯彻总路线
    据新华社26日讯　北京科学、教育文艺界在看到中共“八大”二次会议闭幕的消息后，情绪振奋，决心以新的干劲贯彻党在社会主义建设时期的总路线。
    全国科学技术普及协会副主席、中国科学院技术科学部副主任茅以升说，“八大”提出了全民性的技术革命文化革命的任务，我听了感到无比的兴奋！面对着全国生产大跃进，思想大解放，今天再来个技术大革命，文化大革命，祖国的科学事业也一定会大跃进了，广大群众对科学迷信也解放了，有党的领导和全国人民的努力，我国科学技术水平一定可以在极短时期内，赶上并且超过国际的先进水平。
    中国科学院化工冶金研究所所长叶渚沛目前正在进行强化高炉炼铁过程和转炉氧气炼钢的研究。他看到“八大”闭幕的消息后兴奋地对记者说，他相信我国钢、铁的产量和质量赶上英国水平的时间一定会大大少于十五年。他研究用十个大气压的压力和摄氏一千二百五十度的热风进行强化高炉炼铁，这是世界上没有遇到过的新问题，用这种方法炼铁可使产量提高一倍。
    化学研究所高分子化学组的青年研究人员在“八大”闭幕消息公布以前，已经在共青团中国科学院代表大会上听到了关于八大精神的传达，他们跃进的干劲更加大了。原来已经先进的跃进计划，现在还要提早完成。有机硅（矽）橡胶和硅漆原定两年解决生产问题，五年赶上美国，后来，在共青团中国科学院代表大会上，他们提出要提前到明年“五一”解决生产问题，两年赶上美国。
    首都各高等学校正在按照总路线的精神进行教学和科学研究上的两条道路的辩论，以便在这个基础上建立新的教学内容、新的教学方法。中国人民大学已经派出六十多名师生分赴天津、哈尔滨、唐山等市工业部门参加整风运动，了解各先进的工业部门在管理上所作的革新。有些系已经开始打破旧的过时的教学体系，在逐步地按照总路线的要求建立新的教学体系。清华大学水利系的教师也开始按照“中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中小型企业同时并举”的方针在改进教学。
    总路线也给北京文化艺术界以巨大的鼓舞。北京一百多名著名作家、艺术家正在十三陵工地深入生活，进行劳动锻炼和创作活动。各省市文化部门的代表从25日起在北京举行会议，讨论根据党在社会主义建设时期的总路线，多快好省地发展社会主义电影事业的问题。这次会议提出要政治挂帅、解放思想、职权下放、群策群力，争取在五年到十年内逐步做到“省有制片厂、县有电影院、乡有放映队”。
