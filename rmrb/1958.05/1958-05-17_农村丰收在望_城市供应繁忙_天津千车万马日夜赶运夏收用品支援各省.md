Rural Areas Anticipate a Good Harvest; Cities are Busy with Supplies
Tianjin Sends Thousands of Vehicles Day and Night to Transport Summer Harvest Supplies to Support Various Provinces

With good harvests of summer crops expected in various regions, the Tianjin market is bustling. On the three main roads leading to Tianjin's railway hub - the East Station - thousands of trucks, horse-drawn carts, and cargo tricycles loaded with goods are constantly heading towards the freight yards day and night. On average, every half hour, several train cars are filled with summer harvest and planting production materials and daily necessities, heading to wheat-producing areas such as Zhengzhou, Dezhou, Xuzhou, Shijiazhuang, Bengbu, and Xi'an, as well as other regions across the country. The current daily transport volume has increased by more than 20% compared to the same period last year, setting a record for the highest volume of commodity supply before the summer harvest since the liberation of Tianjin.

Under the new circumstances of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, Tianjin's commercial departments arranged the production of summer commodities as early as February based on rural needs and began supplying them in April. In the second quarter of this year alone, the Tianjin Production Materials Wholesale Station plans to supply various regions with agricultural tools and machinery such as gas generators, boiler engines, electric motors, three-tooth weeding hoes, and waterwheels, which is fifty-one times more than the same period last year. The supply of rubber tires for handcarts is equivalent to two and a half times the total supply last year. Chemical raw materials such as baking soda and sulfur, which were rarely sent to the countryside in the past, are now supplied in large quantities to rural areas for seed soaking and pest control.

Tianjin has a rich and colorful supply of daily necessities for rural areas this year, with more than 1,300 new varieties added. The supply of light-colored printed cloth will increase by 134,000 meters compared to last year, and undershirts and vests will increase by more than 200,000 dozens. The popular Tianjin bamboo shell thermos bottles have further improved their insulation; the rubber content of the rubber shoe soles has been increased from 38% to 45% in the past, and the side strips have also been thickened to ensure that the soles do not break when folded and the uppers do not crack.

　　农村丰收在望　城市供应繁忙
    天津千车万马日夜赶运夏收用品支援各省
    各地夏收作物丰收在望，给天津市场带来了繁忙景象。通往天津铁路枢纽——东站的三条主要马路上，数以千计的满载着货物的卡车、马车、三轮货车，日夜不停地驶向货场。平均每半小时，就有好几节车皮装满夏收夏种生产资料和生活用品，开往郑州、德州、徐州、石家庄、蚌埠、西安等麦产区和全国其它地区，目前每天的运输量比去年同期增加20％以上，创天津解放以来夏收前商品供应量的最高纪录。
    今年在工农业生产大跃进的新情况下，天津市商业部门早在2月间就根据农村的需要，安排了夏季商品的生产，4月就开始供应。今年二季度里，单是天津生产资料批发站计划供应各地的煤气机、锅驼机、电动机、三齿耘锄、水车等农具农械，就比去年同期增加五十一倍。手推车胶轮的供应量相当于去年全年的两倍半。过去很少下乡的小苏打、硫磺块等化工原料，现在大量供给农村用来浸种和消灭病虫害。
    天津市今年供应农村的生活日用品丰富多彩，新增添的花色品种有一千三百多个。浅色印花布的供应量将比去年增加十三万四千公尺，汗衫背心增加二十多万打。深受农民喜爱的天津竹壳暖水瓶，进一步提高了保温力；胶鞋大底的含胶量已由过去的38％提高到45％，围条也加厚了，保证底折不断，帮不裂缝。
