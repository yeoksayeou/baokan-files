　　Construction Begins on Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway
    Another New Railway Under Construction in Inner Mongolia

    (Our Newspaper) News: The key construction phase of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway, the main railway line from Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, to Xining City, Qinghai Province—specifically the He'kou to Xining section—commenced on the 10th.

    Currently, construction workers are working on underwater cofferdams for the reinforced concrete arch bridge on the Datong River, at the border of Gansu and Qinghai provinces. The Daxia Tunnel within Qinghai territory also began construction on the 10th. The railway bridge spanning the Yellow River near He'kou is also scheduled to begin construction in mid-May.

    The He'kou to Xining section of the Lanzhou-Qinghai Railway is 174 kilometers long. The entire section will cross the Yellow River, the Datong River, and eight tributaries of the Yellow River, including the Huangshui River, and will also require tunneling through the Laoya Gorge. The project is relatively arduous. However, construction workers have put forward a resounding slogan: "For the railway to Xining, we fear no natural barriers to our determination! Complete the bridge and tunnel by 'August 1st', open to Xining by 'July 1st' next year!" (Bi Guang)

    Xinhua News Agency: Construction has recently begun on the Zhangjiakou-Jining Railway. The Third Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, responsible for building this railway, is taking various measures to accelerate the progress of the project, striving to open the entire line to traffic next year.

    The Zhangjiakou-Jining Railway is 162 kilometers long, starting from Guoleizhuang on the Beijing-Baotou line in Hebei Province, heading west-northwest through Beixinzhuang, Tuyaogou, and other places, entering the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region via Xinghe, Tuchengzi, and Bawanghe to Jining City. This railway shortens the distance by more than 110 kilometers compared to the existing Zhangjiakou-Datong-Jining section. After the entire line is completed and opened to traffic, it will further promote economic and cultural exchanges between the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and all parts of the country.

　　兰青铁路动工了
    内蒙古又修一条新铁路
    本报讯　由甘肃兰州市通往青海西宁市的铁路干线—兰青铁路河口—西宁段，在10日开始重点施工。
    现在，筑路工人正在甘肃、青海两省交界处的大通河上，为钢筋混凝土拱桥做水下围堰工作；青海境内的大峡隧道也在10日同时动工。从河口附近横跨黄河的铁路大桥，也将在本月中旬动工修建。
    兰青铁路河口—西宁段全长一百七十四公里。全段要越过黄河，大通河，八跨黄河支流湟水，还要打通老鸦峡峡谷。工程比较艰巨。但是筑路工人提出了响亮的口号：“为了铁路通西宁，不怕天险挡决心，‘八·一’完成桥隧道，明年‘七·一’通西宁！”。　（碧光）
    新华社讯　张（家口）—集（宁）铁路已在最近动工兴建。负责修筑这条铁路的铁道部第三工程局，正在采取各项措施加快工程进度，争取明年全线通车。
    张集铁路全长一百六十二公里，以京包线上河北省的郭磊庄为起点，向西偏北经由北辛庄、土窑沟等地，进入内蒙古自治区的兴和、土城子、坝王河到集宁市。这条铁路比现有张家口—大同—集宁这段铁路缩短距离一百一十多公里。全线修成通车后，将进一步促进内蒙古自治区同全国各地的经济文化交流。
