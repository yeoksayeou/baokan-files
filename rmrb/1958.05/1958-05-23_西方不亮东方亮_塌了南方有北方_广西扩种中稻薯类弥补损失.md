"If the West is Dark, the East Will Shine; If the South Collapses, There is the North"
Guangxi Expands Planting of Intermediate Rice and Potatoes to Make Up for Losses

(Our dispatch) Nanning - Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have put forward battle slogans such as "If the West is dark, the East will shine" and "Reducing early rice planting does not mean reducing yields; one crop must be equivalent to two," strengthening field management and expanding the planting area of ​​intermediate rice and high-yield crops, to make up for the losses caused by drought in early rice, and strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year.

During the spring plowing season this year, the Autonomous Region experienced a severe drought. In early April, more than three million laborers were mobilized daily throughout the region to carry out drought-resistant sowing and seedling protection campaigns. By the end of April, 86% of this year's planned early rice planting area of ​​16 million mu had been successfully completed. However, due to the prolonged drought, some of the planted early rice had been dried up or withered. From May 12th to 15th, widespread rainfall occurred throughout the region. The drought situation in Guilin and Pingle prefectures has been alleviated, but in the remaining four prefectures of Yishan, Baise, etc., the rainfall was small, and the drought situation has not yet been resolved.

Taking advantage of the rain to rush plowing and harrowing, and changing the paddy fields that were originally affected by the drought and unable to plant early rice to planting intermediate rice; expanding the planting area of ​​high-yield crops such as sweet potatoes and cassava; strengthening the management of early rice fields; these are the various active measures taken by the Party committees at all levels in the Autonomous Region after the rain. The planting area of ​​intermediate rice in the region has expanded from more than 5 million mu to more than 7 million mu, and the area of ​​potato crops has increased from more than 4 million mu to more than 10 million mu, which is nearly double the area of ​​last year. The Pingle Prefecture originally affected by the drought and unable to plant early rice of more than 60,000 mu of paddy fields, decided to immediately change to planting intermediate rice, and has now completed 30% of the change planting plan. In Guilin Prefecture, where intermediate rice transplanting has basically ended, more than 200,000 mu of potato crops have been planted as of the 16th. Rong County Prefecture seized the opportunity of rainfall to organize forces to reclaim wasteland and expand the planting area of ​​sweet potatoes and cassava. As of the 16th, more than 1.2 million mu have been planted in the entire prefecture.

At the same time, farmers of all ethnic groups have strengthened the field management of early rice. Many areas have adopted various methods such as eliminating third-class seedlings, improving second-class seedlings, or topdressing rice seedlings with fertilizer, and launched an early rice overproduction campaign. In Rong County Prefecture, more than 4.8 million mu of early rice have completed the second and third weeding and topdressing. Yulin, Cangwu, Cenxi and other eight counties have eliminated more than 1 million mu of third-class seedlings. After the rain, a "one crop equals two crops" overproduction campaign was launched throughout the prefecture to ensure the completion of this year's 30% increase in production target. According to statistics from four counties including Shilong and Nandan in Yishan Prefecture, more than 220,000 people have recently been invested in eliminating third-class seedlings. In Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, all of the county's more than 30,000 mu of third-class seedlings have now been eliminated, with lush greenery everywhere and strong seedlings. (Li Yifang)

    西方不亮东方亮　塌了南方有北方
    广西扩种中稻薯类弥补损失
    本报讯　广西僮族自治区各族农民，提出“西方不亮东方亮”、“早稻减种不减收，一造要顶两造收”等战斗口号，加强田间管理，扩大中稻和高产作物的种植面积，来弥补早稻受旱所造成的损失，力争全年丰收。
    今年春耕期间，自治区发生严重的干旱。4月初，全区每天曾出动三百多万个劳动力，开展抗旱播种保苗运动，到4月底，胜利完成了今年早稻计划种植面积一千六百万亩的86％。但因久旱不雨，种下的早稻有部分已被旱死或枯黄。5月12日到15日，全区各地普遍降雨，桂林、平乐两专区已经解除旱象，其余宜山、百色等四个专区，雨量较小，旱象仍未解除。
    趁雨抢犁抢耙，把原来受旱未能插下早稻的稻田改种中稻；扩大红薯、木薯等高产作物的种植面积；加强早稻田的管理；这是自治区各级党委在雨后采取的各种积极措施。全区中稻播种面积由五百多万亩扩大到七百多万亩，薯类作物由四百多万亩增加到一千多万亩，比去年扩大将近一倍。平乐专区原来受旱未能插上早稻的六万多亩稻田，决定立即改种中稻，现已完成改种计划的30％。在中稻插秧已经基本结束的桂林专区，到16日止已种下薯类作物二十多万亩。容县专区抓住落雨时机组织力量开荒、扩大红薯、木薯种植面积。到16日全专区已种下一百二十多万亩。
    与此同时，各族农民加强了早稻的田间管理，许多地区采取消灭三类禾，提高二类禾或泼禾胎肥等多种办法，开展早稻超额增产运动。容县专区四百八十多万亩早稻，已经完成了第二、第三次耘田追肥。玉林、苍梧、岑溪等八个县，已消灭三类禾苗一百多万亩。雨后，全专区范围内开展起“一造顶两造”超额增产运动，保证完成今年增产三成的任务。据宜山专区石龙、南丹等四个县统计，最近投入消灭三类禾苗的就有二十二万多人。三江侗族自治县全县三万多亩三类禾苗，现在已经全部消灭，亩亩葱绿，蔸蔸茁壮。　（李益芳）
