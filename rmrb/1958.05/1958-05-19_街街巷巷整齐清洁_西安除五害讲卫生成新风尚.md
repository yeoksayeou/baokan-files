　　Clean and Tidy Streets and Alleys
　　Xi'an's Campaign to Eliminate the Five Pests and Promote Hygiene Creates a New Fashion

　　(Our Newspaper, Xi'an) Reporter Zhang Guoning reports: After more than three months of the campaign to eliminate the five pests (including bedbugs) and promote hygiene, the entire city has begun to become a civilized and clean city. Now, all streets and alleys are clean. The walls of many houses have been freshly painted. Even in some areas with poor living conditions, it is now difficult to see sparrows, rats, and mosquitoes. The original sewage pits have now become pools of clear water. All toilets are disinfected and tightly sealed at all times, so mosquitoes and flies cannot breed. Promoting hygiene and eliminating the five pests has become a new fashion. Pedestrians carry fly swatters and swat flies at any time. People spit into spittoons on the streets or into their own handkerchiefs when they need to spit.

　　In Xi'an's mass campaign to "eliminate the five pests and promote hygiene," large-scale, concentrated attacks on the "five pests" are combined with regular sanitation work. Everyone takes action, and everyone is involved in joint prevention, forming a massive mass movement.

　　During these three months, an average of more than 300,000 people across the city have been involved in the battle to eliminate the "five pests." In addition, according to different situations at different times, more than ten large-scale, concentrated battles have been organized. One battle followed another in quick succession. After a concentrated attack on rats during the Spring Festival, there was a follow-up campaign to dig up pupae, followed by a general offensive against sparrows. From January to April 28, the city eliminated more than 1.95 million sparrows, more than 1.37 million rats, destroyed more than 75,000 jin of flies and pupae, and blocked more than 540,000 rat holes and sparrow nests. More than 570 sewage pits and pools were filled and dredged. In addition, drug spraying and fumigation were carried out on more than 4 million square meters of sewage and mosquito and fly breeding grounds, and the moat was dredged to turn stagnant water into running water. More than 58,000 cellars, dry wells, and dilapidated cave dwellings were cleaned and sprayed with chemicals. More than 40,000 shock teams (groups) were organized in various streets and alleys to take charge of different areas and support each other. Almost every household among the residents has fly swatters and rat traps. Flies and mosquitoes are swatted during the day, and rat holes and sparrow nests are blocked at night. On April 13 and 27-28, more than 500,000 to 700,000 people were mobilized every day across the city to set up dummies and colorful flags everywhere on rooftops, walls, treetops, and buildings. When sparrows were encountered, they waved flags, shouted, beat gongs and drums, and chased them fiercely, leaving the sparrows no chance to stay for a moment. They were then captured after being exhausted. In these three large-scale fatigue battles alone, more than 60,000 sparrows were wiped out.

　　街街巷巷整齐清洁
　　西安除五害讲卫生成新风尚
    本报讯　记者张国宁报道：连续三个多月的除五害（包括臭虫）、讲卫生运动之后，全市开始成为一个文明、清洁的城市。现在，各街巷一片清洁。不少房屋的墙壁都粉刷一新。就是一些居住条件较差的地方，现在也很难看到麻雀、老鼠和蚊蝇。原来的污水坑，如今已是一池清水。各处厕所都随时消毒、严密封盖，因此蝇蚊已无法孳生。讲卫生、除五害已经成为新的风尚。行人都带着蝇拍，随时扑打苍蝇。人们在吐痰时都吐在街道上的痰盂或自己手帕里。
    西安市全民“除五害、讲卫生”运动中，把大规模的突击痛歼“五害”战役和经常性的卫生工作相结合，人人动手，处处联防，形成了声势浩大的群众性的运动。
    三个月中，全市平时都有三十多万人投入除“五害”的战斗。此外，又根据各时不同情况，曾先后组织了十多次大规模突击性的战役。在一个战役紧接着一个战役，春节痛歼老鼠之后，紧接着又突击挖蛹，随后又展开了对麻雀的总攻击。1月至4月28日，全市共消灭麻雀一百九十五万多只，老鼠一百三十七万多只，灭蝇挖蛹七万五千多斤，堵塞鼠洞和雀窝五十四万多个。填平和疏通污水坑池五百七十多个。另对面积四百多万平方公尺的污水和蚊、蝇孳生场所进行了药物喷洒和烟熏消毒，疏通了护城河，使死水变活水。并对五万八千多个地窖、枯井、破窑洞等作了扫除和喷洒药剂。各街巷组织了四万多个突击队（组）分片负责，互相支援。居民中家家户户都有蝇拍和打鼠器。白天打苍蝇、蚊子，入夜堵塞鼠洞、雀窝。4月13日和27、28日两天全市每天都出动了五十多万至七十多万人，在屋顶、墙头、树梢和建筑物上，到处设置假人、彩旗，遇有麻雀，便摇旗呐喊，鸣锣击鼓，穷追猛攻，使麻雀到处飞窜，没有片刻停留机会，然后在精疲力尽之后被捕获。仅这三次大规模的疲劳战中，歼灭麻雀六万多只。
