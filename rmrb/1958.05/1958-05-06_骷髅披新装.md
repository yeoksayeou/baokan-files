    Skeleton in New Clothes
    The United States is mired in the quagmire of economic crisis. Millions of workers and their families have no bread, no milk, cannot afford rent, and cannot pay their children's tuition. At such a time, the American bigwigs are actually worried about the living standards of the people in the Middle East. Republican Senator Flanders recently suggested implementing a "New Marshall Plan" to "raise the living standards of the Middle East" and "win the friendship of the Middle East" in order to counter the "decline of American power in the Arab world."
    The Marshall Plan is a term people remember vividly. It brought superficial prosperity to the American economy at the expense of the tears and suffering of the people of Western European countries, and it finally became an ominous term in history as a "cursed" synonym. Flanders, this old fox in American politics, wants to drag the Marshall Plan out of the grave again and put new clothes on the skeleton because he superstitiously believes, or perhaps fantasizes, that he can take the last piece of bread from the tables of the Arab people to sacrifice to the specter that is now tightly entwined with capitalism—the periodic economic crisis. Naturally, this can only be a fantasy. However, this precisely reflects that capitalism, terminally ill, has no cure, and the American ruling clique has no choice but to resort to desperate measures!

    骷髅披新装
    美国正陷入经济危机的泥淖，数以百万计的工人和他们的家属没有面包、没有牛奶、付不起房租、交不起孩子的学费，在这样的时候，美国的大人先生们居然为中东老百姓的生活水平担起忧来了。共和党参议员弗兰德斯最近建议实行一项“新马歇尔计划”来“提高中东的生活水平”和“赢得中东的友谊”，以便对付美国“在阿拉伯世界势力的衰退”。
    马歇尔计划，这个名词人们是记忆犹新的。它用西欧国家人民的眼泪和痛苦给美国经济带来表面的繁荣，它也终于以“可诅咒的”同义字成为历史上的不祥的名词。弗兰德斯这个美国政界的老狐狸，所以又想把马歇尔计划从坟墓中拉出来，为骷髅披上新装，是因为他迷信着，不，也许是幻想着能够从阿拉伯人民的餐桌上夺去最后一块面包，来祭祀如今已经紧紧缠绕着资本主义的幽灵——周期性的经济危机。自然，这只能是幻想。不过，这恰恰反映了病入膏肓的资本主义无法可治，美国统治集团只好病急乱投医而已！
