Council for Mutual Economic Assistance - An Organization for Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Among Socialist Countries

The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) is an economic cooperation organization established by eight European socialist countries based on the principles of proletarian internationalism and on the basis of the common interests and mutual solidarity of the people of socialist countries. This internationalist economic cooperation is the first of its kind in human history.

The CMEA was established in January 1949, following an economic conference held in Moscow by six countries: the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. Albania joined in February 1949, and the German Democratic Republic joined in September 1950. It is an open organization, and any European country that agrees with its principles and is willing to engage in broad economic cooperation with the member states of the council can join.

The establishment of the CMEA marked a new stage of comprehensive cooperation and common prosperity in the economic relations between socialist countries. Close cooperation among the socialist countries, especially the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, has vigorously promoted the common economic upsurge of the member states. The rapid industrialization of the fraternal countries in Europe is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and the active activities of the CMEA. For example, in 1957, the production level of steel and pig iron in European socialist countries increased approximately three times compared to pre-war levels, while Western European countries only increased by 70%. The economic landscape of Eastern European socialist countries has greatly changed. Albania, previously one of the most backward countries in Europe with little industry, is now transforming from an agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country with the assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and the efforts of the Albanian people. The proportion of its total industrial output value in the total national economic income has increased from 9.8% in 1938 to 43.5% in 1955. Bulgaria, which previously had no steel industry, has now established a steel industry with the assistance of the Soviet Union, which can already meet one-third of its domestic needs. Before the war, Poland's industrial output only accounted for two-fifths of Italy's, but now its steel output per capita has exceeded that of Italy and Japan, and its tractors are sold to the Middle East and Southeast Asian countries. The Hungarian people, who suffered from the 1956 counter-revolutionary rebellion, have, with the strong assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, now brought most industrial enterprises to or exceeded the levels before the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The scope of economic cooperation between socialist countries is broad and diverse, including: effective coordination of national economic plans; equal and mutually beneficial trade relations; economically more advanced countries providing other fraternal countries with long-term loans on preferential terms, supplying other fraternal countries with complete sets of industrial and other enterprise equipment and a series of technical assistance; gratuitously exchanging technical data on a reciprocal basis; exchanging experts to introduce scientific and technological and production experience; experts from various countries jointly studying certain technical issues; and providing economic assistance without compensation. This cooperation between the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries is a manifestation of socialist rational international division of labor and cooperation.

The guiding role in economic mutual assistance activities is the Soviet Union's selfless assistance to other socialist countries based on proletarian internationalism. Currently, with the help of the Soviet Union, nearly 500 enterprises have been built or are under construction in socialist countries. These enterprises have an annual output of 15 million tons of steel, approximately 120,000 tons of copper, more than 4.5 million tons of petroleum products, approximately 40,000 tractors, more than 850,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, and power stations with a total power generation capacity of 8 million kilowatts (capable of producing 23 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually), etc. Before World War II, the total output of steel in the socialist countries of Eurasia (excluding the Soviet Union) was only more than 6 million tons, approximately 500,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, 1,500 tractors, and 32 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The establishment of the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research, equipped with the most advanced equipment, is a clear example of scientific cooperation among socialist countries.

The Soviet Union has provided other socialist countries with long-term loans totaling 21 billion rubles on the most preferential terms. For example, in 1957, the Soviet Union lent Hungary a long-term loan of 750 million rubles at an annual interest rate of only 2% (the US Export-Import Bank's loans to other capitalist countries have annual interest rates of 3.5%-6%, and US loans are attached to enslaving political conditions). At the same time, in order to take care of the difficulties faced by fraternal countries, the Soviet Union also canceled some debts that socialist countries should have borne.

In addition to the Soviet Union, other socialist countries also provide strong support to each other. For example, Czechoslovakia provides complete sets of equipment for power stations, chemical plants, and cement factories under construction in fraternal countries. The German Democratic Republic exports complete sets of equipment for power stations, rolling workshops, chemical plants, cement factories, and many light industry and food industry enterprises. Poland provides complete sets of equipment for the construction of sulfuric acid plants, cement plants, sugar factories, etc. Many socialist countries are working together to build industrial enterprises and other economic constructions. For example, Hungary and Romania are jointly exploiting Romanian natural gas, and Poland, the German Democratic Republic, and Czechoslovakia have decided to jointly exploit Polish brown coal.

The headquarters of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is located in Moscow. Each member state has a considerable number of permanent representatives participating in the work. Plenary meetings are held in rotation in the capitals of the member states, and the representative of the host country serves as the chairman of the meeting. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance also regularly holds various professional meetings to study issues of mutual cooperation. At the meeting held in Warsaw last year, the issue of cooperation in the long-term development plans of the basic sectors of the national economies of various countries for ten to fifteen years was raised, further opening up new magnificent prospects for the economic and cultural development of socialist countries.

    经济互助委员会——社会主义国家全面经济合作的组织
    经济互助委员会是八个欧洲社会主义国家本着无产阶级国际主义的原则，在社会主义国家人民的共同利益和互相团结的基础上建立的经济合作组织。这种国际主义的经济合作是人类有史以来的第一次。
    经济互助委员会是1949年1月，苏联、保加利亚、匈牙利、波兰、罗马尼亚和捷克斯洛伐克六个国家在莫斯科举行经济会议以后决定成立的，阿尔巴尼亚在1949年2月加入，德意志民主共和国在1950年9月加入。它是公开的组织，凡是同意它的原则并且愿意与委员会各成员国进行广泛的经济合作的欧洲国家都可以加入。
    经济互助委员会的成立标志着社会主义国家间的经济关系进入了全面合作、共同繁荣的新阶段。各社会主义国家之间的紧密合作，特别是苏联的无私援助，大力推动了各成员国的经济的共同高涨。欧洲各兄弟国家的迅速工业化是同苏联的无私援助和经济互助委员会的积极活动分不开的。比如1957年欧洲各社会主义国家钢和生铁的生产水平约增为战前的三倍，而西欧国家只增加了70％。东欧社会主义国家的经济面貌大大改变了。阿尔巴尼亚以前是欧洲最落后的国家之一，没有什么工业，在苏联和其他社会主义国家的援助和阿尔巴尼亚人民的努力下，它现在正在从农业国变成农业—工业国，它的工业总产值在国民经济总收入中的比重，已从1938年的9.8％增为1955年的43.5％。以前没有钢铁工业的保加利亚，现在在苏联的援助下建立了钢铁工业，它已经能够满足国内三分之一的需要。波兰战前工业产量只占意大利的五分之二，现在它按人口平均计算的钢产量已经超过了意大利和日本，它所生产的拖拉机远销到中东和东南亚国家。遭受1956年反革命叛乱的匈牙利人民，在苏联和其他社会主义国家大力援助下，现在已经把大部分工业企业达到并且超过了反革命叛乱事件前的水平。
    社会主义国家之间的经济合作的范围是广泛的和多种多样的，其中包括：国民经济计划的有效配合；平等互利的贸易关系；经济较先进的国家以优待的条件给予其它兄弟国家以长期贷款，供给其它兄弟国家全套工业企业和其他企业设备以及一系列的技术援助；在互惠的基础上无偿地交换技术资料；互换专家以便介绍科学技术和生产经验；各国专家共同研究某些技术问题；无偿地给予经济援助等。苏联和东欧社会主义国家的这种合作是社会主义合理的国际分工和合作的表现。
    在经济互助活动中起主导作用的是苏联对其他社会主义国家的无产阶级国际主义的无私援助。现在，在苏联的帮助下，社会主义各国已经建成和正在建设的企业近五百个。这些企业年产一千五百万吨钢、约十二万吨铜、四百五十多万吨石油产品、约四万台拖拉机、八十五万多吨氮肥、和总发电能力达八百万瓩的发电站（每年能生产电力二百三十亿度）等等，而在第二次世界大战以前，欧亚两洲社会主义国家地区（苏联除外），总共才生产六百多万吨钢、约五十万吨氮肥、一千五百台拖拉机和三百二十亿度电力等。配备有最精良设备的联合原子核研究所的成立，更是社会主义国家科学合作的明显事例。
    苏联根据最优惠的条件给其他社会主义国家以总额达二百一十亿卢布的长期贷款。例如1957年苏联曾贷给匈牙利七亿五千万卢布的长期贷款，年利仅为2％。（美国进出口银行对其他资本主义国家的贷款，年利达3.5％—6％，美国的贷款并且附有奴役性的政治条件。）同时，苏联为了照顾兄弟国家所存在的某些困难还取消了一些社会主义国家所应承担的债务。
    除苏联以外，其他社会主义国家也互相展开大力支援。例如，捷克斯洛伐克为兄弟国家中正在建设的发电站、化学工厂和水泥工厂等提供整套设备，德意志民主共和国出口建设发电站、压延车间、化学工厂、水泥工厂和许多轻工业及食品工业企业的整套设备，波兰提供建设硫酸工厂、水泥厂、制糖厂等整套设备。许多社会主义国家协力建设工业企业和其他经济建设。例如匈牙利和罗马尼亚共同进行利用罗马尼亚天然煤气的工作，波兰、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克决定共同协力利用波兰的褐煤。
    经济互助委员会的总部设在莫斯科，每个成员国都有相当人数的常驻代表参加工作，全体常务会议轮流在各会员国首都举行，由所在国代表担任该次会议主席。经济互助委员会还经常召开各种专业性会议来研究相互协作的问题。去年在华沙举行的会议上提出了各国国民经济基本部门的十年到十五年长期发展计划方面协作的问题，进一步开辟了社会主义国家经济和文化发展的新的宏伟远景。　（新华社）
