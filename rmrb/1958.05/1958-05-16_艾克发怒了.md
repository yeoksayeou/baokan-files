    Eisenhower is Furious
    He Jun
    Hearing the Vice President was beaten,
    Eisenhower roared with thunder:
    America's face must be salvaged,
    Quickly dispatch the Navy, Army and Air Force!
    Outwardly strong but inwardly weak, a paper tiger,
    Furious in appearance but frightened at heart;
    Demonstrating people cannot be intimidated,
    Nixon slipped away from the "backyard"!
    (The above picture is a close-up of Eisenhower, taken when he was furious upon hearing that Nixon was repeatedly beaten in Latin American countries. Xinhua News Agency manuscript)

    艾克发怒了
    禾君
    听说揍了副总统，
    艾克暴跳如雷鸣：
    美国面子要挽回，
    赶快出动海陆空！
    外强中干纸老虎，
    脸上发怒心里惊；
    示威人民吓不倒，
    “后院”溜了尼克松！
    （上图是艾森豪威尔一个特写镜头，是当他听说尼克松在拉丁美洲各国接连挨揍而恼羞成怒时拍摄的。新华社稿）
