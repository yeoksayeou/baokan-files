Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 16th: Indonesian President Sukarno stated at a mass rally in Jombang, fifty kilometers from Surabaya, on the 16th: "We refuse to negotiate with the rebels because they openly invite imperialists to intervene. We are fully determined to completely eliminate the rebels."

Sukarno pointed out that imperialist countries are illegally supplying weapons to the rebels and bombing various parts of the country. Therefore, this is not just intervention; it is aggression against Indonesia. Sukarno said, "We firmly believe that we have sufficient strength to repel imperialist intervention. We are now in a strong position – the people are united and full of fighting spirit. The Indonesian people love peace, but they love independence even more. If our independence is violated, we will use every means available to fight the interventionists."

Sukarno said that Indonesia is not isolated. Indonesia has many friends – Egypt, India, the Soviet Union, China, and many other countries that condemn imperialism.

Deputy Chairman of the National Council, Abdoelgani, said at the rally that colonialism is the mortal enemy of the Indonesian people and must never be compromised with. He said that the struggle currently being waged by the Indonesian people is not a civil war, but a struggle against colonialism.

Approximately 100,000 people attended the rally. President Sukarno arrived there from Jakarta on the morning of the 16th. He will return to Jakarta on the afternoon of the 17th.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 17th: Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda reported on the statements made by various countries regarding their support for Indonesia's struggle against foreign intervention at a cabinet meeting held on the evening of the 16th.

After discussing the recent political situation and military operations in Indonesia, the cabinet meeting deemed it necessary to raise national vigilance and strengthen military forces. To this end, the government intends to request that the parliament prioritize the discussion of the draft conscription law.

Minister of Information Sudibjo said after the meeting that the Indonesian government is confident that it has the strength to eliminate the rebel groups. He said that in North Sulawesi, military operations are currently progressing smoothly.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 17th: According to Antara News Agency, Indonesian Army authorities issued a communique today stating that reports from the military command directing operations in North Sulawesi indicate that the local rebels are using troops of the "pro-Taiwan Kuomintang." According to the report, this fact was discovered in a certain area of North Sulawesi, and the details are not yet clear.

　　苏加诺重申保卫民族独立决心
    消灭叛乱分子并击退干涉者
    陆军当局证实北苏拉威西发现蒋军
    新华社雅加达16日电　印度尼西亚总统苏加诺16日在离泗水五十公里的惹班的一次群众集会上说：“我们拒绝同叛乱分子谈判，因为他们公开招引帝国主义者进行干涉。我们有充分的决心要完全消灭叛乱分子。”
    苏加诺指出，帝国主义国家正在非法供应叛乱分子武器，并且轰炸这个国家的各个地方，因此这不仅仅是干涉而已，这是对印度尼西亚的侵略。苏加诺说，我们充分相信，我们有足够的力量来击退帝国主义的干涉。我们现在处在有力的地位——人民团结一致而且斗志昂扬。印度尼西亚人民爱和平，但是更爱独立。如果我们的独立遭到侵犯，我们将利用能够利用的一切手段来同干涉者作战。
    苏加诺说，印度尼西亚不是孤立无援的。印度尼西亚有许多朋友——埃及、印度、苏联、中国和许多其它国家，它们都谴责帝国主义。
    民族委员会副主席阿卜杜加尼在集会上说，殖民主义是印度尼西亚人民的死敌，决不能跟它妥协。他说，目前，印度尼西亚人民所进行的斗争并不是内战，而是对殖民主义的斗争。
    参加这次集会的大约有十万人。苏加诺总统是在16日的上午从雅加达到那里去的。他将在17日下午返回雅加达。
    新华社雅加达17日电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达在16日晚间举行内阁会议上，就各国发表的关于支援印度尼西亚反对外国干涉的斗争的声明作了报告。
    内阁会议在讨论了印度尼西亚最近的政治局势和军事行动的情况以后，认为有必要提高民族警惕和加强军事力量，为此，政府打算提请国会优先讨论兵役法草案。
    情报部长苏迪比约在会后说，印度尼西亚政府深信它有力量消灭叛乱集团。他说，在北苏拉威西，军事行动目前正在顺利进行中。
    据新华社雅加达17日电　据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚陆军当局今天发表公报说，正在北苏拉威西指挥作战的军事司令部发来的报告表明，当地的叛乱分子正在使用“亲台湾国民党”的军队。据报告，这一事实是在北苏拉威西某地发现的，详情还不清楚。
