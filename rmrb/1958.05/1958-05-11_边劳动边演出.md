　　Performing While Laboring
　　Whenever the actors of the Fuxian Ping Opera Troupe of Liaoning Province arrive at a place, they often help the farmers clean their yards and carry water before their fatigue from the journey has even disappeared. Or they divide into several groups to work alongside the farmers on construction sites and in the fields. During labor breaks, they sing Ping Opera or "Lotus Drop" and clapper talks reflecting the great leap forward in agricultural production in every corner of the construction site and the fields, greatly encouraging the farmers' labor enthusiasm. The actors of the Jianchang Ping Opera Troupe also participate in labor all day and perform in the evening. Each actor has a labor manual, and they ask the agricultural cooperative to record their work points according to their labor achievements, but they do not want any remuneration. The peasants who officially watched the Fuxian Ping Opera Troupe's performances in the evening numbered 300,000; they also trained more than 300 amateur troupe activity backbones in the countryside.

　　边劳动边演出
    辽宁省复县评剧团的演员每到一个地方，常常是路途上的疲劳还没有消失，就帮助农民打扫院子，挑水，或者分成几个组到工地、田间同农民一起劳动。到劳动休息时候，他们就在工地和田间的各个角落唱起评戏或者反映农业生产大跃进的“莲花落”和快板来，大大鼓舞了农民的劳动热情。建昌评剧团的演员在白天也是全部参加劳动，晚间演出。每个演员都有本劳动手册，请农业社根据他们的劳动成绩记上工分，但不要报酬。晚间正式看复县评剧团演出的农民有三十万人次；他们还在农村培养了三百多名业余剧团的活动骨干。
