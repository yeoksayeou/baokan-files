Why?

    Taking Medicine Makes the Throat Especially Bitter
    The tongue is a taste organ that can distinguish the sour, sweet, bitter, salty and other tastes of food. The different parts of the tongue have different functions. The tip of the tongue is most sensitive to sweetness; the tip and sides of the tongue are most sensitive to saltiness; the root of the tongue is most sensitive to bitterness; and the sides of the tongue are most sensitive to sourness.
    After taking medicine, the bitter taste of the medicine is not felt in other parts of the tongue, only the root of the tongue still feels the bitterness, so we feel that the "throat" is particularly bitter.

专栏：为什么？

    吃药嗓子眼特别苦
    舌是一种味觉器官，它可以辨别食物的酸、甜、苦、咸等味道。舌的各部分是有分工的。最能感觉甜味的是舌尖；最能感觉咸味的是舌尖和舌的两侧，最能感觉苦味的是舌根，最能感觉酸味的是舌的两侧。
    吃药后，药的苦味在舌的其他部分感觉不出来了，只是舌根还觉得出苦味来，所以我们就觉得“嗓子眼”特别苦。
