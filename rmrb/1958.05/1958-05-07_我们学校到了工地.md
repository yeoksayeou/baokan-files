    Our School Has Arrived at the Construction Site
    Our school is the Tianjin Water Conservancy School. In implementing the educational policy of combining work and study and running the school diligently and thriftily, and under the principle of not affecting the quality of teaching, all teachers, students, and staff are better trained through practical labor. This semester, in addition to the second and third year students who have been dispatched to various special districts and counties in Hebei Province to support rural water conservancy construction, the first year, eight classes, two hundred and eighty students, and the vast majority of faculty members also participated in the West River Sluice gate construction project of the Tianjin Special Commissioner's Office on April 9th. We are adopting a "learn while working, work while learning" approach, bringing the school to the construction site.

    我们学校到了工地
    我们的学校是天津水利学校，在贯彻勤工俭学、勤俭办学的教育方针中，在不影响教学质量的原则下，使全体师生员工更好地通过实际劳动得到锻炼。这学期，除二、三年级已分赴河北省各专区、县支援农村水利建设外，一年级八个班二百八十名同学和绝大部分教职员于4月9日也参加了天津专署西河闸的建闸工程。并采取“边劳动，边学习”的方式，把学校带到了工地。
