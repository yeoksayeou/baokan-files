The Rebellion in North Sulawesi
    Recently, after successively liberating Padang and Bukittinggi, the Indonesian government has basically defeated the rebels in Sumatra. The rebel group is shifting its center of activity to North Sulawesi and establishing a so-called "revolutionary government" in Manado.

    Sulawesi is the third largest island in Indonesia. Located between Kalimantan and the Maluku Islands, it is known as the "Orchid of the Equator." It has an area of approximately 190,000 square kilometers and a population of approximately 5 million, most of whom are Muslim.

    North Sulawesi is relatively close to the Philippines and Taiwan, but far from Java, where the central government of Indonesia is located. Manado is much closer to the Philippines or Taiwan than Padang. At the same time, Sulawesi is a region where the federal elements and feudal forces left over from the Dutch colonial regime are relatively strong, and it has long been a zone where the "Islamic Army" operates. Since February of last year, the rebel group has established bases in North Sulawesi, taking advantage of the geographical conditions of this area to collude with the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek cliques and carry out rebellious activities.

    Sulawesi belongs to the Indonesian Seventh Military District in terms of the military system. On March 2nd of last year, one of the rebel leaders, former Seventh Military District Commander Sumual, illegally declared a "state of war" and established a "military government," freezing the deposits of Indonesian government agencies. On the same day, Sumual announced the "Charter of Total Struggle," openly opposing the Sukarno plan and demanding that the central government grant broad "autonomy" in government security, transportation, finance, economy, and social affairs to the four provinces under his jurisdiction. At that time, the United States openly supported Sumual's rebellion, transporting guns, ammunition, and other light weapons from the Philippines, Taiwan, and British North Borneo to Sulawesi. As a result, many American pilots and Chiang Kai-shek clique members appeared in Manado.

    On January 9th of this year, Sumual secretly plotted with Husseiny, the head of the Central Sumatra rebel group, and others to establish a "revolutionary government." In early February, while President Sukarno was visiting Japan, Sumual also went to Japan to threaten Sukarno and attempt to purchase weapons from Japan. After Sumual's plot failed, he went to the Philippines, Taiwan, and Singapore to engage in extensive activities and actively colluded with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to smuggle American-made military supplies to Sulawesi. In addition, Sumual also had close ties with senior officials of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization. Sumual planned to have the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization first occupy some areas of North Sulawesi as military bases for the group, and he also indicated that the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization could use all Indonesian military bases after he seized power.

    On March 31st of this year, when the Indonesian government forces were victoriously advancing in Sumatra, the rebel group leaders secretly instructed the Sumual-Sumba rebel group entrenched in North Sulawesi to "open up a second battlefield" in North Sulawesi to coordinate with each other. At the end of April, the Sumual rebels took advantage of re-armed former Royal Dutch Navy personnel to capture Morotai in North Sulawesi, hindering the government forces' actions in Sumatra.

    The rebel group's move to Manado as its center of activity is an attempt to continue to retain a stronghold in Sulawesi with the support of the United States, stubbornly resist, and save themselves from their complete military defeat, thereby expanding their rebellious activities. At present, the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have become even more unscrupulous in openly supporting the rebel group. In addition to airlifting weapons and providing financial assistance, U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek aircraft are even bombing Indonesian cities and warships, engaging in blatant interference.

    The Indonesian government has stated that it will resolutely eliminate the rebels in Sulawesi. As early as early April, most of Central Sulawesi had been recovered. Now, the government forces are preparing to concentrate their efforts on eliminating the rebels in North Sulawesi. The death throes of the rebel group can be crushed.

### 北苏拉威西的叛乱活动

　　北苏拉威西的叛乱活动
    最近，印度尼西亚政府在连续光复了巴东和武吉丁宜后，已基本上打垮了苏门答腊的叛军。叛乱集团正在把活动中心移到北苏拉威西，并在万鸦老建立所谓“革命政府”。
    苏拉威西是印度尼西亚的第三大岛。位于加里曼丹和马鲁古群岛中间，有“赤道上的兰花”之称。面积约十九万平方公里，居民约五百万人，多数信奉伊斯兰教。
    北苏拉威西离菲律宾和台湾都比较近，离印度尼西亚中央政府所在地的爪哇却比较远。从万鸦老到菲律宾或到台湾比由巴东到菲律宾或到台湾近得多。同时，苏拉威西是荷兰殖民政权遗留下来的联邦分子和封建势力较为强大的地区，长期以来又是“伊斯兰教军”进行活动的地带。叛乱集团从去年2月起就在北苏拉威西建立了据点，利用这一地区的地理条件，同美、蒋集团勾结，进行叛乱活动。
    苏拉威西在军事系统方面属印度尼西亚第七军区。去年3月2日，叛乱首脑之一、前第七军区司令苏穆阿尔，非法宣布“战争状态”，并成立“军事政府”，冻结印度尼西亚政府机关的存款。同一天，苏穆阿尔公布了“全面斗争约章”，公开反对苏加诺方案，要挟中央政府对他所辖的四个省给予政府治安、交通、金融、经济和社会方面的广泛的“自治权”。当时美国就公开支持了苏穆阿尔的叛乱行动，从菲律宾、台湾、英属北婆罗洲等地把枪支、弹药和其他轻武器运送到苏拉威西去。万鸦老因此出现了很多美国飞行员和蒋介石集团分子。
    今年1月9日，苏穆阿尔同中苏门答腊叛乱集团头子侯赛尼等一起密谋策划成立“革命政府”。2月初，正当苏加诺总统访问日本时，苏穆阿尔也跑到日本去，威胁苏加诺，并想从日本购买武器。苏穆阿尔的这个阴谋失败后，他又到菲律宾、台湾和新加坡大肆活动，并积极地和美国、蒋介石集团相互勾结，把美国制军火偷运到苏拉威西去。此外，苏穆阿尔还同东南亚条约组织的高级官员有密切联系。苏穆阿尔打算让东南亚条约组织首先占有北苏拉威西的一些地区作为这个集团的军事基地，他并且表示，在他取得政权后，东南亚条约组织可以使用印度尼西亚所有的军事基地。
  今年3月31日，当印度尼西亚政府军在苏门答腊胜利进军时，叛乱集团头子曾秘密指示盘踞在北苏拉威西的苏穆阿尔—宋巴叛乱集团，要他们在北苏拉威西“开辟第二战场”来互相策应。4月底，苏穆阿尔叛军就利用重新武装的前荷兰皇家海军人员攻占了北苏拉威西的摩罗泰，牵制政府军在苏门答腊的行动。
    叛乱集团把活动中心移到万鸦老，是企图继续在美国的支持下，在苏拉威西保留据点，负隅顽抗，以挽救他们在军事上的彻底失败，从而扩大叛乱活动。目前，美国和蒋介石集团已更加肆无忌惮地公开支持叛乱集团，除空运武器，接济金钱外，美、蒋飞机竟轰炸印度尼西亚的城市和军舰，进行露骨的干涉。
    印度尼西亚政府已表示要坚决肃清苏拉威西的叛军。早在4月初，中苏拉威西的大部分地区便已收复。现在，政府军正准备集中力量消灭北苏拉威西叛军。叛乱集团的垂死挣扎是可以被粉碎的。
