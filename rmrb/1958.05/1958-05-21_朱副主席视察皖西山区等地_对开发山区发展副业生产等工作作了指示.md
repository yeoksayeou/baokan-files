Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 20th – In late April, Vice Chairman Zhu De inspected and visited Ma'anshan, Wuhu, Yuxikou, Hefei, Lu'an, the Fozi Ridge Reservoir and other places in Anhui Province. During the five days, he traveled tirelessly across the north and south of the Yangtze River and the mountainous areas of western Anhui, traversing more than a thousand li, going deep into the countryside and factories to inspect various tasks and give instructions, especially detailed instructions on developing mountain resources and developing sideline production.

The mountainous areas of southern and western Anhui Province are rich in resources, producing not only the famous "Qihong" and "Tunlv" teas, which are known both at home and abroad, but also abundant bamboo, hemp, cork, oil tea, tung oil, silkworms, and shiitake mushrooms. Before liberation, due to the devastation of the Kuomintang reactionary government, mountain production gradually declined. After liberation, mountain production was vigorously developed and highways were built, resulting in great development of local mountain products. This year's tea production, for example, exceeds the highest pre-war annual output. When Vice Chairman Zhu heard reports in Wuhu and Lu'an on developing mountain production and exploiting mountain resources, he instructed that mountain production should be unified in planning, with large-scale planting of tea, mulberry trees, fruit trees, oak trees, peanuts, corn and other crops to develop a variety of production methods. All the wealth of the mountains must be dug out and transported out.

Regarding how to develop tea production, Vice Chairman Zhu said that we should not only open up tea gardens in the mountains, but also promote the planting of tea trees down the mountains, in the hilly areas. South of the Huai River, each cooperative can use all available space to plant dozens of mu of tea trees. The wintergreen trees planted in front of and behind villages, as well as in government offices, schools, and parks, can all be converted into tea trees, which are both beautiful and economically valuable.

At the Fozi Ridge Reservoir, Vice Chairman Zhu and Li Kaibai, the director of the Fozi Ridge Agriculture, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Cooperative, discussed how mountain cooperatives can develop mountain production in multiple ways. Vice Chairman Zhu said that mountain cooperatives should not only produce, but also raise more tussah silkworms, hunt more, and raise more wild animals. We must think of all kinds of methods based on local conditions. For example, the precious Chinese medicine "Dendrobium officinale" produced in Huoshan County should be cultivated artificially. Winter jasmine can be changed to rose, which is both beautiful and adds fragrance. Vice Chairman Zhu learned about fruit tree cultivation and seedling raising when he inspected the Xiaojiuhua Mountain Horticultural Farm. He encouraged the cadres there to learn technology and guided them to look at problems from the perspective of long-term development. He pointed out that fruit garden production must be greatly developed in the future. At that time, half of the fresh fruit could be sold to meet market consumption needs, and the other half could be processed into canned goods, so that people in distant places could eat fruit, and the income could be increased several times. Finally, he repeatedly instructed: "You must set up a processing plant."

In the Luyan No. 2 Cooperative of Hanbaidu District, Lu'an County, which is rich in hemp production, Vice Chairman Zhu inquired in detail about the cooperative's production and the lives of its members. When the Vice Chairman learned that the cooperative had a large population and little land, he instructed: "You can send some people to the mountains to open tea gardens, plant mulberry trees... The Dabie Mountains are very rich. In this way, you can turn one cooperative into two, wouldn't your family business be bigger? Then, your cooperative will still be the parent cooperative. Do you think it's feasible?"

Vice Chairman Zhu was very concerned about the development of mountain labor and transportation. He said that immigration is one way to solve the shortage of labor in developing mountainous areas. In addition, we must educate the masses to reform agricultural tools and improve labor efficiency. Transportation must be greatly developed, building roads, changing river courses, and using vehicles, boats, and rafts to transport local mountain products.

When Vice Chairman Zhu inspected the Wanggang Pig Farm, which was established by cadres from the Chaoxian Supply and Marketing Cooperative, he carefully inquired about the feeding of pigs. The main feed for the pigs here is collected aquatic plants and planted bitter vegetables and sweet potato leaves. Vice Chairman Zhu said that there are many aquatic plants in Chaohu Lake, and pig raising can be greatly developed around Chaohu Lake. He said to the comrades at the pig farm that you should pay attention to the timing of pig raising. In the past, the supply of pork was tight during festivals and the end of the year. You should pay attention to adjusting the situation and changing this situation. Vice Chairman Zhu asked, "How much should a pig weigh to be most cost-effective? You should study it." Vice Chairman Zhu was very interested in Anhui Province's method of raising fish in rice paddies. He said that this method is very good, which can not only increase income, but also increase rice production, and can be greatly promoted.

Vice Chairman Zhu's inspection and visits have inspired everyone's enthusiasm for socialist construction. Many places have set off even greater production upsurges after Vice Chairman Zhu's inspection. According to the instructions, the Wuhu area changed its original plan to open up 1.12 million mu of new tea gardens from 1958 to 1960 to 2.62 million mu. After Vice Chairman Zhu gave instructions to the Lu'an Prefectural Committee, the Prefectural Committee held a meeting that night and revised the district's production plan. For tea production, the district's output in 1957 was more than 80,000 dan. The original plan was to increase it to 160,000 dan by 1962, but now it has been changed to increase production to 310,000 dan by 1962. Peanuts have also been increased from the originally planned 700,000 mu this year to 1 million mu. According to the spirit of Vice Chairman Zhu's instructions, economic crops and local products such as oil tea, tung oil, lacquer bamboo, yuan bamboo, walnuts, shiitake mushrooms, hemp, ramie, jute, silkworms, tussah silkworms, and castor beans were also studied item by item, and plans for great development were drawn up. Each development plan put forward detailed and feasible measures. Guo Bende, the deputy captain of the Luyan No. 2 Production Team of Hanbaidu, is a veteran comrade who went through the Long March. He is usually active in his work and deeply loved by the members of the cooperative. However, since the Great Leap Forward, he often felt old and "couldn't keep up with the situation." When he saw Vice Chairman Zhu, who was more than 20 years older than him, going deep into the mountains to inspect his work despite his hard work, he was deeply moved and very ashamed. He said that he must "keep up with the situation" and lead the production well to repay Vice Chairman Zhu's concern. That night, he mobilized 37 members to dismantle and replace three mountain walls, accumulating more than 5,000 dan of fertilizer.

    朱副主席视察皖西山区等地
    对开发山区发展副业生产等工作作了指示
    新华社合肥20日电　4月下旬，朱德副主席在安徽省视察和访问了马鞍山、芜湖、裕溪口、合肥、六安、佛子岭水库等地。在五天中，他不辞劳苦地奔波在大江南北和皖西山区，跋涉一千余里，深入农村、工厂，对各项工作进行视察，并作了指示，特别是对开发山区富源和发展副业生产等工作作了详细的指示。
    安徽省皖南山区和大别山区，资源丰富，不但出产大量驰名中外的“祁红”“屯绿”等名茶，而且盛产竹、麻、栓皮、油茶、油桐、桑蚕、香菇等物资。解放前，由于国民党反动政府的摧残，山区生产日渐萎缩。解放后，大力开发山区生产，修建公路，山区土特产已有很大发展，如今年的茶叶产量，就超过战前最高年产量。朱副主席在芜湖、六安时，听了发展山区生产、开发山区富源的汇报后，指示说，山区生产要统一规划，要大量种植茶、桑、果树、柞树、花生、玉米等作物，发展多种多样的生产，要把山区的一切财富挖出来，运出来。
    关于如何发展茶叶生产问题，朱副主席说，我们不仅要在山区开辟茶园，而且要提倡茶树下山，在丘陵地区栽茶。淮河以南地区，每个合作社都可以利用一切空地，种上几十亩茶树，在村前村后以及机关、学校、公园所栽的冬青树，可以全部改种茶树，这样，既美观又有经济价值。
    在佛子岭水库，朱副主席和佛子岭农林牧合作社社主任李开白等人研究了山区合作社如何多方面发展山区生产的问题。朱副主席说，山区合作社除了要生产外，还要多养柞蚕，多打猎，多饲养野生动物。要根据当地情况想各种办法。如霍山县出产的名贵中药“石斛”等，就要想办法用人工培植；月季花可以改种玫瑰花，既美观，又增加香料。朱副主席在视察小九华山园艺场时，了解了果树培养和育苗情况。他勉励这里的干部学习技术，并引导他们从发展远景上来看问题，他指出将来果园生产一定要大发展，那时，可以拿一半鲜果出卖，满足市场消费的需要；另外一半加工成为罐头，这样，既能使远地人吃到水果，收益还可以增加几倍。最后他一再指示说：“你们要办一个加工厂。”
    在盛产大麻的六安县韩摆渡区陆堰二社。朱副主席详细询问社里的生产情况和社员的生活情况。当副主席了解到该社人多土地少的情况时指示说：“你们可以分一些人到山上去，开茶园、种桑树……，大别山区是很富的。这样，你们一个社就搞成两个社，你们的家业不就是大了吗？那时，你们这个社，还是个母社，你们看行不行？”
    朱副主席非常关心开发山区的劳动力和交通运输问题。他说，移民是解决开发山区劳动力不足的一个办法，除此之外，我们还要教育群众改革农具，提高劳动效率。交通运输要大发展，修筑公路，改变河道，使用车辆、船只和木排等运输工具，通过各种办法，将山区的土特产品运出来。
    朱副主席在视察巢县供销社下放干部创办的王岗养猪场时，仔细询问了猪的喂养情况。这里喂猪的饲料主要是采集的水草和种植的苦妈菜、山芋叶。朱副主席说，巢湖水草很多，巢湖周围可以大量发展养猪事业。他对养猪场的同志说，你们养猪要注意节期，过去每逢节日年关，猪肉供应紧张，你们要注意调剂，改变这种局面。朱副主席提出，“养猪应该养到多重才最合算呢？你们研究一下。”朱副主席对安徽省推广稻田养鱼的办法很感兴趣，他说这种办法很好，既可增加收入，稻子又可增产，可以大大推广。
    朱副主席的视察和访问，鼓舞了大家的社会主义建设热情。很多地方在朱副主席视察后，已掀起了更大的生产高潮。芜湖专区根据指示精神，把原计划1958年到1960年开辟新茶园一百一十二万亩改为二百六十二万亩。朱副主席给六安地委指示后，地委当夜就召开会议，重新修订了全区的生产计划。茶叶生产，1957年全区产量八万多担，原计划到1962年增至十六万担，现改为到1962年增产到三十一万担；花生也由原计划今年播种七十万亩，增加到一百万亩。各地根据朱副主席指示精神，对油茶、油桐、漆毛竹、元竹、核桃、香菇、大麻、苎麻、黄麻、桑蚕、柞蚕、蓖麻等经济作物和土特产，也逐项进行了研究，订出了大发展的规划，每项发展计划，都提出了详尽而切实可行的措施。韩摆渡陆堰二社生产大队副队长郭本德，是一位经过长征的老同志，平时工作积极，深受社员们的爱戴，但从大跃进以来，常常感到年老，“跟不上阵”，当他看到比自己年高二十多岁的朱副主席不辞劳苦地深入山区来检查工作时，深受感动，也十分惭愧，他表示一定要“跟上阵”，把生产领导好，答谢朱副主席的关怀。当天晚上，他就发动三十七个社员，拆换了三垛山墙，积肥五千多担。
