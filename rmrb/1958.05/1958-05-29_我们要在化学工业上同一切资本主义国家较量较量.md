We must compete with all capitalist countries in the chemical industry
Peng Tao, Minister of Chemical Industry

Under the glorious illumination of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, China's chemical industry will surely develop by leaps and bounds. It will appear on the field of competition with all capitalist countries in a fighting stance. We firmly believe that in the near future, approximately within fifteen years, it will win glory for the country and shine brilliantly.

The Chemical Industry is an Important Front for Competition with Capitalist Countries

What is the chemical industry? What are its characteristics? What is its role? In the past, our understanding of this was also unclear. On the one hand, due to a lack of knowledge, and on the other hand, because the chemical industry is developing rapidly, our understanding often lags behind. Based on the practice and experience of the past year or two, we believe that the chemical industry is an industry that makes the fullest use of all material resources. It can utilize all natural materials (such as air, water, minerals, plants, etc.), and it can also utilize all industrial and agricultural by-products to produce thousands of raw materials, materials, and products. From the point of view of the chemical industry, there is no waste in the world. All useless materials can be turned into useful materials, and all worthless things can be turned into the wealth of the people. Because the chemical industry has these characteristics, it can achieve "making the best use of everything," so that the country's various valuable resources can be fully and rationally utilized in a comprehensive way (such as the comprehensive utilization of coal, the comprehensive utilization of petroleum, the comprehensive utilization of seawater, the comprehensive utilization of agricultural and sideline products, etc.). Comprehensive utilization of resources, as a national technical policy, is the greatest increase in production and the greatest saving, which can both save the use of resources and increase infinite wealth for the country.

As a raw material industry, the chemical industry supplies industry, agriculture, and transportation with a wide variety of means of production. As a processing industry (some processed products are also means of production), it supplies people with a wide variety of consumer goods to a large extent. Therefore, it is closely related to all sectors of the national economy and to all aspects of people's lives. It has increasingly become an important factor in promoting the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, national defense, and science, and it has become an important factor in improving people's lives. From this, it can be seen that we cannot understand the chemical industry in isolation, but should regard it as an extremely important front in the entire economic front.

Dare to compete? Can we win?

It is certain that China's steel and coal can catch up with all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time, but does the chemical industry, which is still in a state of serious backwardness, dare to make such a comparison? Can it catch up with all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time? Our answer is also affirmative.

In terms of the chemical fertilizer industry, the United States produced approximately 28 million tons of chemical fertilizers in 1957. Assuming a growth rate of 5% per year from now on (which is actually difficult to achieve), it may reach 35.8 million tons by 1962. China may also exceed this number by 1962.

Therefore, the focus of the competition is not in the chemical fertilizer industry, but in the organic synthesis industry and the basic chemical industry.

The organic synthesis industry is still an emerging industry. It is attacking others, raising itself, and expanding its application range day by day. It is replacing steel and non-ferrous metals to a great extent, and is creating various new materials with various special properties that have never existed in nature. It is providing mankind with thousands of rich and colorful new products, beautifying people's lives. The United States is currently the most developed capitalist country in the world in the organic synthesis industry. In 1957, it produced 2 million tons of various plastics, an estimated 240,000 tons of synthetic fibers, and 1.15 million tons of synthetic rubber; while China's organic synthesis industry is almost a blank slate. Therefore, in order to catch up with and even surpass capitalist countries in terms of variety and quantity, we must make up our minds from now on and make persistent efforts.

In terms of basic chemical industry, acids and alkalis are the most basic means of production, and almost all industries cannot do without them. As a raw material industry, their importance is no less than that of steel, coal, wood, and cement. Capitalist countries have developed rapidly in this area, and our current supply is also very tight. We must make great efforts to catch up with and even surpass them. In the inorganic salt industry, which is part of the basic chemical industry, we did not fully recognize its importance in the past. Due to the development of the atomic energy industry, rocket technology, and other modern science and technology, its value is now increasing day by day. At present, there are approximately 4,000 known inorganic salt products, of which approximately 600 are used in large quantities, and we cannot produce many important products, which is far from meeting the needs of various industrial sectors, especially the development of non-ferrous metallurgy and cutting-edge industries. Therefore, we must make every effort to develop the inorganic salt industry.

In summary, we are able to catch up with and even surpass all capitalist countries in the various important fields of the chemical industry in a relatively short period of time, but in order to catch up with and even surpass them in the organic synthesis industry and the inorganic salt industry, we must also wage an arduous battle. In the competition with capitalist countries, we are full of confidence in victory. But it is undeniable that today's chemical industry is still the weakest front in the entire economic front. In order to achieve overall victory, we must strengthen this weak front. We believe that the only effective way to strengthen this front is to have the entire Party pay attention and strengthen leadership. As long as politics is in command, the chemical industry can become an invincible force.

Strengthen our own ambition and destroy the enemy's prestige

To enable China's chemical industry to catch up with and even surpass all capitalist countries in a relatively short period of time, we must first break down superstitions and liberate people from the slavish thinking of belittling themselves and willingly admitting defeat. Recently, some technicians summarized their ideological situation as six beliefs and six disbeliefs: (1) Believe in foreign countries but not in China; (2) Believe in "foreign" methods but not in "native" methods; (3) Believe in "stipulations" but not in reality; (4) Believe in authority but not in the masses; (5) Believe in things but not in people; (6) Believe in specialization but not in being "red." It can be seen that superstitious views and the idea of belittling oneself are very serious.

Superstition of "foreigners" in science and technology has been deeply rooted in the minds of many people, becoming a kind of ideological oppressive force. They believe that they dare not think of anything that foreigners have not thought of, and they dare not do anything that foreigners have not done. Even if there are some things that China is indeed better than foreign countries, they dare not admit it. Even if it is a Chinese invention, they have to go to foreign books to find out whether there is a theoretical basis. In short, everything is okay for foreigners, but not for China. Under the control of this mental state, they are depressed and unable to lift their heads or straighten their backs. How can they talk about competing with all capitalist countries? Therefore, it is necessary to promote ideological liberation, cut off the slave tail, promote strengthening our own ambition and destroying the enemy's prestige, and promote daring to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to do, among technicians, among the vast number of cadres, and among the masses of workers. We must dare to think about some problems that we did not dare to think about in the past, and dare to think about some problems that foreigners dare not think about.

Over the past year, we have deeply realized that Mao Zedong's thought has the invincible power. This thought, like a neutron, can break through the atomic nucleus, explode the infinite creativity of 600 million people, and guide us from victory to victory.

Break down the mysterious view and let the chemical industry flourish

Chemical reactions generally have the characteristics of high temperature, high pressure, low temperature, vacuum, flammability, explosiveness, and toxicity. The reaction process is also invisible and intangible. Therefore, the chemical industry can easily put on a mysterious face, making people daunted. In fact, everything in the world, as long as you touch it, understand it, and master it, is not mysterious at all.

In the past, many of our comrades had a mysterious view of the chemical industry. This view is expressed in: only believing in oneself and not believing in local areas, only believing in "foreign" methods and not believing in "native" methods, only seeing one's own strength and not seeing the strength of all aspects, and even less seeing the strength of the masses. Precisely because of this view, they wanted to take care of everything themselves, restricting the chemical industry to a narrow circle, which greatly hindered the development of the chemical industry.

Facts over the past few years have proved that local areas can run the chemical industry well, and that local areas often run it more, faster, better, and more economically than the central (ministry) government. For example, we have been running the Taiyuan Chemical Plant for seven years, and not a single workshop has been put into production by the end of last year, but many of the products of this chemical plant have long been produced by local factories. Our technicians used to be unconvinced when they heard about the benefits of local factories, thinking that local industry was not standardized, but now they have begun to change. They dare to let the nitrogen fertilizer industry with high-pressure technology go to the countryside and are willing to go to local factories to learn from them (they used to think that only foreign countries had treasures). Now we all realize that relying solely on our own strength is limited. We must fully rely on the initiative of local areas, and we must resolutely implement the central government's policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, with local industry as the main focus; and simultaneously developing large, medium, and small enterprises, with medium and small enterprises as the main focus.

Recent facts have also proved that the masses can use native methods to run the chemical industry. For example, Sichuan Fengjie uses sulfur residue to produce ammonium sulfate and uses kiln waste gas to produce ammonium bicarbonate and other chemical fertilizers; Jiangsu Changzhou uses rice husks to manufacture ordinary glass and organic products such as methanol, furfural, and acetic acid. These are the most vivid examples. Examples like this will continue to appear. The so-called native method does not mean that the product is "native," but that the equipment is simple and generally does not use mechanical operation. Therefore, the more native the method, the more it can obtain materials locally, the more it can save investment, and the easier it is to mobilize the masses to run it universally. It is an indispensable force for accelerating the development of China's chemical industry. Our policy should be to simultaneously develop "native" methods and "foreign" methods. On the one hand, we must make modern technology ("foreign" methods) go to the countryside. On the other hand, we must support, promote, and improve "native" methods, so that modern technology can be combined with the creativity of the people.

Facts over the past few years have also proved that the chemical industry can be run by other departments. For example, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has attached chemical plants to steel joint ventures; the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has attached chemical workshops to oil refineries; the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry has attached synthetic resin workshops to insulation material factories, etc. This is beneficial to the development of the chemical industry. Because the chemical industry can obtain resources from all aspects and utilize them in a comprehensive way, we hope that all departments with conditions (including universities, colleges, and secondary schools) can establish various chemical industries according to their own resource conditions (we are willing to help technically). This can also be called the simultaneous development of the chemical industry sector and other sectors.

We believe that as long as we break down the mysterious view and change the chemical industry from being run by a few people to being run by the whole people, we can make the chemical industry flourish and open up a broad path for the development of the chemical industry.

Overcome all difficulties and strive for final victory

In our competition with capitalist countries, the second five-year plan is a decisive five years, and it is also the five years with the greatest difficulties for us: weak technical strength, many new technologies have not yet been mastered, many equipment cannot be manufactured, and the equipment that can be manufactured cannot be fully supplied. These are concrete difficulties that cannot be ignored. But these difficulties can be overcome. For example, if the difficulty of insufficient technical strength is solved by mobilizing and organizing chemical industry talents and chemical talents (including skilled workers) from various industrial and mining enterprises, major colleges and universities, secondary technical schools, research institutions of the Academy of Sciences, and relevant departments, dividing labor and cooperating, and undertaking certain research tasks and production tasks, this difficulty can be solved. Of course, we will encounter many unforeseen difficulties on our way forward. However, the real difficulty lies not in the difficulty itself, but in a fear of difficulty. Difficulty is an obstacle to progress for those who fear it, but it is a driving force for those who are determined. For example, some people believe that cotton can increase production and there are many wild fibers, so it does not seem very necessary to develop synthetic fibers since there are some difficulties in spinning; some people believe that there is already a lot of steel, so it does not seem very important to develop plastics; some people believe that "native" methods can already manufacture fertilizers, so it does not seem necessary to develop so many nitrogen fertilizer plants since there are some difficulties in supplying equipment. These ideas are obviously not conducive to the development of the chemical industry.

Our competition with capitalist countries is a competition for time and speed. Every minute is extremely valuable. We must not be timid, overcautious, hesitant, or indecisive in the face of difficulties, and lose the opportunity. We must go all out with revolutionary vigor and move forward with firm steps.

We firmly believe that as long as we implement the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, with the care and attention of the Central Committee and the entire Party, and relying on local areas and the masses, we will surely be able to achieve victory in the competition with capitalist countries.

But this victory is not the final victory. We must continue to move forward on this basis, make persistent efforts, catch up with and even surpass all capitalist countries in terms of product output per capita, and prepare a sufficient material basis for communism.

What kind of contribution can the chemical industry make in a communist society? We can imagine that because chemical fertilizers can fully meet the needs of agriculture, we will not only have inexhaustible food, but also be able to eat rich meat, vegetables, fruits, and sweets every day. Due to the high development of the pharmaceutical industry, we can not only overcome various diseases, but also prolong life, and perhaps even rejuvenate. Due to the high development of chemical fibers and dyes, people's clothing will be more colorful and dazzling, and wool and silk will become ordinary clothing materials. Due to the high development of the synthetic fragrance industry, everyone will be able to use high-end cosmetics, making people dress up more beautifully. Due to the high development of the plastics industry, we can build various forms of colorful houses as described in mythology. These houses can be folded up for easy carrying and migration. Due to the high development of the plastics industry, we can guarantee the supply of ingenious, beautiful, and colorful household appliances and daily necessities. Due to the high development of plastics and synthetic rubber, we can manufacture various means of transportation that are more comfortable, more beautiful, and lighter than they are now. At that time, people's material lives in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation will be maximized due to the high development of the chemical industry. People's cultural lives will also be able to enjoy sound, color, and fragrant movies and televisions due to the high development of the chemical industry, and will receive other novel cultural products. These ideas may seem like imagination now, but they will definitely become reality in the future.

    我们要在化学工业上同一切资本主义国家较量较量
    化学工业部部长　彭涛
    在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，我国的化学工业必将突飞猛进的向前发展，它将以战斗的姿态出现在同一切资本主义国家较量的比武场上，我们坚信，在不久的将来，大约在十五年内，它将为国争光，大放异彩。
  化学工业是同资本主义国家较量的一条重要战线
    什么是化学工业？它的特点是什么？它的作用如何？过去我们的认识也是不明确的，一方面由于知识不足，一方面也由于化学工业正在日新月异地发展，我们的认识往往跟不上。根据一两年来的实践和体会，我们认为化学工业是一个最充分利用一切物质资源的工业，它可以利用一切天然物（如空气、水、矿物、植物等），也可以利用一切工业和农业的副产物，生产出成千上万种的原料、材料和产品。从化学工业的观点来说，世界上并没有废物，一切无用的物质，都可以变为有用的物质，一切不值钱的东西，都可以变为人民的财富。正因为化学工业具有这样的特点，因此，它可以做到“物尽其用”，使祖国各种宝贵的资源能够得到充分合理的综合利用（如煤的综合利用、石油的综合利用、海水的综合利用、农副产品的综合利用等等）。资源的综合利用，作为国家的一项技术政策来说，它是最大的增产和最大的节约，既可以节约资源的使用，又可以为国家增加无限的财富。
    化学工业作为原材料工业来说，它供给工业、农业、交通运输业以多种多样的生产资料。作为加工工业来说（一部分加工产品也是生产资料），它在很大的范围内，供给人们以多种多样的生活资料。因此，它同国民经济的各个部门，它同人民生活的各个方面，都有密切的联系，它已经日益成为促进工业、农业、交通运输业、国防、科学发展的重要因素，它已经成为提高人民生活的重要因素。由此可见，我们不能孤立地去理解化学工业，而应该把它看作是整个经济战线中一个极为重要的战线。
  敢不敢较量？能不能胜利？
    我国的钢铁和煤炭，能够在较短的时间内赶上一切资本主义国家，这是可以肯定的，但至今仍然处于严重落后状态的化学工业，敢不敢作这样的较量？能不能够在较短时期内也赶上一切资本主义国家呢？我们的回答也是肯定的。
    在化学肥料工业方面，美国1957年生产化学肥料约二千八百万吨，今后每年以5％的发展速度推算（事实上难于达到），到1962年可能达到三千五百八十万吨。我国到1962年也有可能超过此数。
    因此，较量的重点不是化学肥料工业方面，而是有机合成工业和基本化学工业方面。
    有机合成工业还是一个新兴的工业，它正在打击别人，抬高自己，日益扩展着自己的应用范围。它正在很大的范围内代替钢铁和有色金属，正在创造自然界从来未有过的、具有各种特殊性能的各种新材料，它正在为人类提供成千成万丰富多彩的新产品，美化人们的生活。美国是目前世界上有机合成工业最发达的资本主义国家，1957年生产各种塑料二百万吨，合成纤维估计约二十四万吨，合成橡胶一百一十五万吨；而我国目前有机合成工业还几乎是空白点。因此，我们要在品种上和数量上赶上以至超过资本主义国家，必须从现在起下定决心，进行坚持不懈的努力。
    基本化学工业方面的酸、碱是最基本的生产资料，差不多所有的工业都离不开它们，作为原料工业来说，它们的重要性绝不亚于钢铁、煤炭、木材和水泥。资本主义国家在这方面发展很快，而我们目前供应也很紧张，必须用很大的努力赶上以至超过他们。基本化学工业方面的无机盐工业，我们对于它的重要性过去是认识不足的，由于原子能工业、火箭技术和其他现代科学技术的发展，它的身价现在正日益提高。目前，已知无机盐产品约四千种，其中用量较大的约六百种，而我们有许多重要的产品还不能生产，远远不能满足各个工业部门特别是有色冶金和尖端工业发展的需要。因此必须尽最大的努力来发展无机盐工业。
    总起来说，在化学工业各个重要领域中，我们是能够在较短时期内赶上以至超过一切资本主义国家的，但在有机合成工业无机盐工业方面赶上以至超过他们，还必须进行一场艰苦的战斗。在同资本主义国家的较量中，我们是满怀必胜的信心的。但不可否认，今天的化学工业在整个经济战线中，还是最薄弱的一个战线。为了全线胜利，我们必须加强这个薄弱的战线。我们认为加强这个战线，唯一有效的办法，就是全党重视，加强领导。只要有了政治作统帅，化学工业就可以成为一支百战百胜的部队。
  长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风
    要在一个较短的时间内使我国的化学工业赶上以至超过一切资本主义国家，首先要破除迷信，把人们从妄自菲薄和甘拜下风的奴隶思想中解放出来。最近有一部分技术人员把自己的思想情况概括为六信六不信：（一）信外国不信中国；（二）信“洋”法不信“土”法；（三）信“条条”不信实际；（四）信权威不信群众；（五）信物不信人；（六）信专不信红。可见迷信观点与妄自菲薄的思想，是十分严重的。
    在科学技术上迷信“洋人”，在很多人的头脑中已经根深蒂固，成为一种思想上的镇压力量了。他们认为，凡是外国没有想过的事情决不敢想，凡是外国人没有干过的事情决不敢干。明明有些东西中国确实比外国的好，也不敢承认，即使是中国人的创造发明，也要从外国书本上去找有无理论根据。总之，一切都是洋人的行，中国不行。在这种精神状态的支配下，委靡不振，连头也抬不起来，腰也直不起来，怎么还谈得上去同一切资本主义国家较量呢？因此，必须在技术人员中，在广大干部中，在工人群众中，提倡思想解放，割掉奴隶尾巴，提倡长自己的志气，灭敌人的威风，提倡敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为，要敢于想一些过去不敢想过的问题，敢于想一些外国人所不敢想的问题。
    这一年来，使我们深深地体会到，毛主席的思想具有战无不胜的威力。这个思想，就像中子一样，它能够击破原子核，把六亿人民无穷无尽的创造力爆发出来，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。
    打破神秘观点，让化学工业百花齐放
    化学反应一般地具有高温、高压、低温、真空、易燃、易爆、易中毒等特点，反应过程又是看不见、摸不着的，因此，化学工业很容易摆出一副神秘的面孔，令人望而生畏，其实世界上一切事物，只要接触它、了解它、掌握它，是没有什么神秘可言的。
    过去我们有不少同志，对化学工业，是有一种神秘观点的。这种观点表现在：只相信自己，不相信地方，只相信“洋”法，不相信“土”法，只看见自己的力量，看不见各方面的力量，更看不见群众的力量。正因为有了这种观点，就想把一切事情都由自己来包办，把化学工业限制在一个狭小的圈子里，大大地妨碍了化学工业的发展。
    几年来的事实证明：地方是能够办好化学工业的，并且地方办起来，往往比中央（部）办得更多、更快、更好、更省。如太原化工厂我们办了七年，到去年年底还没有一个车间投入生产，但这个化工厂的很多产品地方工厂早就生产了。我们的技术人员，过去一听说地方工厂的好处，总是不服气，认为地方工业不正规，现在他们已经开始转变了，敢于让高压技术的氮肥工业下乡了，愿意到地方工厂去取宝了（过去认为只有外国才有宝）。现在我们都认识到单靠我们本身的力量是有限的，必须充分依靠地方的积极性，必须坚决执行中央工业同地方工业同时并举，并以地方工业为主的方针；大型与中小型同时并举，并以中小型为主的方针。
    最近的事实又证明：群众是可以用土办法来办化学工业的。像四川奉节利用硫磺脚渣生产硫酸铵、用烧窑废气生产碳酸氢铵等化学肥料；江苏常州利用砻糠制造普通玻璃和甲醇、糠醛、醋酸等有机产品，都是最生动的例子。像这样的例子，还会不断地出现。所谓土法，并不是产品“土”，是说设备简陋，一般不用机械操作。因此愈是土办法，就愈能就地取材，愈能节约投资，愈容易发动群众普遍举办，它是加速我国化学工业发展的一支不可忽视的力量。我们方针应该是“土”法与“洋”法同时并举，一方面要使现代化的技术（“洋”法）下乡，另一方面要对“土”法予以支持，推广和提高，使近代技术同人民群众的创造结合起来。
    几年来的事实也证明：化学工业是可以由其它部门举办的。如冶金部在钢铁联合企业中附设化工厂；石油工业部在炼油厂中附设化工车间；第一机械工业部在绝缘材料厂中附设合成树脂车间等等。这样作是有利于化学工业发展的。由于化学工业能够从一切方面取得资源，而加以综合利用，因此我们希望一切有条件的部门（包括大、专及中等学校）都能根据自己的资源条件（技术上我们愿意帮助）兴办各种各样的化学工业。这也可叫作化工部门同其他部门同时并举。
    我们认为，只要打破神秘观点，由少数人办化学工业变为全民办化学工业，才能使化学工业百花齐放，才能为化学工业的发展开拓一条宽广的道路。
  战胜一切困难，争取最后胜利
    在我们同资本主义国家的较量中，第二个五年是一个具有决定意义的五年，也是我们困难最大的五年：技术力量薄弱，许多新技术还没有掌握，很多设备不能制造，能够制造的还不能充分供应。这都是不容忽视的具体困难。但这些困难都是可以克服的。比如说，技术力量不足的困难，如果把各工矿企业、各大专学校、中等技校、科学院和有关部门的研究机构的化工人材和化学人材（包括技术工人），都动员和组织起来，分工协作，担负一定的研究任务和生产任务，这个困难是能够解决的。当然，在我们前进的道路上还会遇到很多预见不到的困难。但是，真正的困难还不在于困难本身，而在于一种害怕困难的心理，困难对于畏难的人是前进的阻力，但对于坚定的人，却是前进的动力。比如说，有人认为棉花能够增产，野生纤维很多，发展合成纤维既然在抽丝上有些困难，好像就不十分必要了；有人认为钢铁已经很多了，发展塑料似乎也不那么十分重要了；有人认为“土”法已经能够制造肥料，搞氮肥厂既然设备供应有些困难，好像就不必发展那么多了。这些想法很显然都是不利于化学工业发展的。
    我们同资本主义国家的竞赛，是一个争时间、比速度的竞赛，每一分钟都是极为宝贵的，决不允许在困难的面前畏首畏尾，顾虑重重，犹豫不决，踌躇不前，而丧失了时机。我们一定要鼓足革命干劲，用坚决的步伐前进。
    我们坚信只要贯彻党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，在中央和全党的关怀和重视下，依靠地方，依靠群众，我们就一定能够在同资本主义国家的较量中取得胜利。
    但这个胜利还不是最后的胜利，我们必须在这个基础上继续前进，再接再厉，在产品产量按人口平均计算方面也要赶上以至超过一切资本主义国家，并为共产主义准备充分的物质基础。
    化学工业在共产主义社会中，可以作出什么样的贡献呢？我们可以设想：由于化学肥料能够充分满足农业的需要，我们不但有吃不完的粮食，而且每人每天能够吃到丰富的肉类、蔬菜、水果和糖果。由于医药工业的高度发展，不但可以战胜各种疾病，而且可以延年益寿，也可能返老还童。由于化学纤维和染料的高度发展，人们的衣着将更为鲜艳夺目，呢绒绸缎将成为普通的衣料。由于合成香料工业的高度发展，每个人都能使用高级化妆品，使人们打扮得更加美丽。由于塑料工业的高度发展，可以建造像神话所描述的各种形式的、五光十色的房屋，这种房屋可能折叠起来，便于携带和迁移。由于塑料工业的高度发展，可以保证供应灵巧美观、丰富多彩的家庭用具和生活用品。由于塑料和合成橡胶的高度发展，可以制造比现在更加舒适、更加美观、更加轻便的各种交通工具。那时候，人们在衣、食、住、行等物质生活方面，都将因为化学工业的高度发展而得到最大限度的满足。人们的文化生活，也将由于化学工业的高度发展，而能享受有声、有色、有香的电影和电视，并得到其他各种新奇的文化用品。这些设想，现在看来还近于想像，但将来一定能够变为现实。
