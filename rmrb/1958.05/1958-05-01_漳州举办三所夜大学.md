Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou — The Zhangzhou Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Fujian Province has established three single-subject night universities: Zhangzhou Institute of Technology, Institute of Science, and Institute of Liberal Arts. They officially began classes on the night of April 22nd.

These three night universities have enrolled more than 240 cadres from the special district, city, and county government offices and enterprises, as well as young people from society, all of whom passed the entrance examinations. The teachers are concurrently serving teachers from middle schools who previously taught physics, chemistry, and other subjects. The majority of them are university graduates with seven or eight years of teaching experience. According to the teaching plans of each school, classes are held for ten hours per week (four evenings), with three sessions each evening. The goal is to complete the first-year university courses in general physics, chemistry, and mathematics from now until February of next year.

Before the start of the semester, the three night universities sent teachers to Xiamen University to study and formulate teaching plans for each subject. They plan to spend two and a half years teaching the required courses in university. In addition, they have invited professors from related departments of nearby Xiamen University to come to the schools to provide teaching guidance.
