Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 3rd. The research and trial production of "therapeutic serum" using animal blood instead of human blood has been successful. This internationally significant research work on biological products was completed by Xie Yujin, chief technician of the Wuhan Biological Products Research Institute, and his assistants during the upsurge of advancing towards science.

"Therapeutic serum" is the most effective biological product for emergency treatment of patients who have lost too much blood due to injuries or other illnesses and for supplementing blood proteins. In the past, the "therapeutic serum" used in our country was extracted from human blood. Due to the difficulty in obtaining human blood and its high price, it could not be supplied in large quantities. The "therapeutic serum" trial-produced using animal blood instead of human blood costs only 1% of the "therapeutic serum" extracted from human blood, and it can be produced in large quantities.

After multiple clinical trials, it has been proven that this "therapeutic serum" has very good efficacy. Professor Kocherchen, the leader of the Soviet expert group of the Ministry of Health, conducted a technical appraisal and believed that the quality of the "therapeutic serum" fully meets international standards. According to existing data, only the Soviet Union and the United States are currently able to extract this type of "therapeutic serum" internationally.

    具有国际意义　达到国际水平
    用动物血提制“治疗血清”成功
    新华社武汉3日电　用动物血代替人血来提制“治疗血清”，已经研究试制成功。这项具有国际意义的生物制品研究工作，是武汉生物制品研究所总技师谢毓晋和他的助手在向科学进军的高潮中完成的。
    “治疗血清”是治疗因负伤或其他疾病而失血过多的急救病患和补充血液蛋白的最有效的生物制品。过去，我国使用的“治疗血清”都是从人血中提制的，由于人血来源困难，价格高昂，不能大量供应。用动物血代替人血试制的“治疗血清”，其价格仅为人血提制的“治疗血清”的1％，而且可以大量生产。
    经过多次临床试用证明，这种“治疗血清”的效用很好。卫生部苏联专家组长柯切尔琴教授作了技术鉴定，认为“治疗血清”质量完全达到国际水平。根据现有资料，目前在国际上只有苏联和美国能够提制这种“治疗血清”。
