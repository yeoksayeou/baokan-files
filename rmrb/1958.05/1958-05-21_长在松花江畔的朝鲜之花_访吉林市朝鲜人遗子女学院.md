Korean Flowers Growing on the Banks of the Songhua River
—A Visit to the Jilin Korean Orphans' School
By Our Correspondent Li Detian
	At the foot of the scenic Beishan Mountain in Jilin City, on the banks of the Songhua River, stands a school with a neat row of about a dozen new buildings. This is the Korean Orphans' School. The school is nurturing five hundred and fifty-three Korean war orphans.
	In the center of the school's playground stands a bronze statue of Kim Il-sung, the leader of the Korean people, engaged in anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare. When this reporter visited the school, the students were in class, and dozens of students in uniforms were doing vaulting horse exercises under the guidance of a teacher. They were all dark and strong, and their happy laughter was heard from time to time.
	This school was established in October 1952. At that time, American imperialism was carrying out frenzied bombing and slaughter in Korea, leaving millions of Korean children without parents and making them orphans. Hundreds of orphans in this school came to China along with many other Korean orphans at that time. When they arrived in Jilin City by special train, the city's Party and government leaders went to the station to greet them, carrying the orphans one by one from the train to their residences. At that time, the youngest of these orphans was only four years old.
	Due to the devastation of the American imperialist war of aggression against Korea, the vast majority of these orphans were weak, sick, and malnourished. At that time, the Jilin Municipal People's Government immediately organized doctors to conduct a general physical examination and provide treatment and enhanced nutrition according to the specific circumstances. After a few months, the health of the war-stricken children rapidly recovered, and their weight generally increased; some gained six kilograms in half a year.
	At the same time, the government allocated huge sums of money to design and build seven or eight school buildings at the foot of Beishan Mountain according to the needs of the school. The Director of the Municipal People's Government's Construction Bureau personally served as the site director. When construction workers learned that this was a school being built for Korean war orphans, they immediately worked day and night, completing the entire project in just over two months, allowing the Korean orphans to move into the new school buildings for study as soon as possible. The new school buildings had classrooms, auditoriums, laboratories, music rooms, dormitories, canteens, clinics, bathrooms, barbershops, and so on. In addition, there was a broadcasting room, and loudspeakers were installed in each dormitory, so they could listen to broadcasts from the Korean People's Broadcasting Station every day.
	The school's teaching equipment is also complete. In the physics, chemistry, biology, and other laboratories, there is sufficient experimental equipment for students to use, including relatively valuable mineral analyzers, microscopes, and so on. A small meteorological observation station has also been established in the school. School instructor Lian Taiyu happily told reporters: "Thanks to the care of the Chinese and Korean governments and people, our children are growing up rapidly. Last year, twenty-five students graduated from this school for the first time, and most of them have returned to their country to pursue further studies in universities or participate in the construction work of their motherland."
	Korean orphans feel warmth everywhere here. Jilin City Party and government leaders often bring various gifts to the school to visit them. Last July, when the students of the college went on a picnic to Kouqian District, Yongji County, the members of the nearby agricultural production cooperatives brought pennants, mirrors, more than 300 kilograms of Korean rice cakes, large fat pigs, and a large amount of soda water to the orphans. An old lady of seventy walked eighty-five li with gifts to see the orphans. One of her sons sacrificed in Korea during the war to resist America and aid Korea. When she saw the orphans, she smiled and shed tears, saying, "Seeing you is like seeing my own son, I am so happy!"
	Students of the Korean Orphans' School have established deep friendships with many Chinese schools in Jilin City.
	Recently, after the news of the upcoming return of Korean war-stricken children to their country came, the students of both countries were reluctant to part. A few days ago, more than 500 students from the school and Chinese students came to the Revolutionary Martyrs' Memorial Tower in Beishan to plant trees and afforest around the memorial tower. One Chinese student and one Korean student jointly planted a pine tree, and they also paved the words "China-Korea Friendship" with stones under the tree. In two days, they planted nearly 2,000 trees together and named it "China-Korea Friendship Forest." When the students parted, they shook hands and hugged tightly, recorded each other's mailing addresses, and encouraged each other to devote themselves to the socialist construction of their motherlands.

    长在松花江畔的朝鲜之花
    ——访吉林市朝鲜人遗子女学院
    本报记者　李德天
    在松花江畔吉林市风景秀丽的北山脚下，有一所整齐地排列着十来幢新建筑物的学校，这就是朝鲜人遗子女学院。这个学院中，抚育着五百五十三名朝鲜战灾孤儿。
    学院操场中心，矗立着朝鲜人民领袖金日成元帅从事抗日游击战争时的铜像。记者来到这个学院访问时，学生们正在上课，操场上有几十个穿着制服的学生，由老师指导着做跳木马的运动锻炼。他们一个个都是黑呼呼的，身体结实强壮，不时发出欢乐的笑声。
    这所学院是在1952年10月建立的。当时美帝国主义在朝鲜进行着疯狂的轰炸屠杀，使千万个朝鲜儿童失去了父母，成为孤儿。这个学院的几百个孤儿就是在那时和其他许多朝鲜孤儿一起来到中国的。当他们乘着专车来到吉林市时，市的党、政领导人都到车站迎接，把孤儿们一个个从火车上抱下，送到住所去。那时，这些孤儿中，最小的才四岁。
    这些孤儿由于受到美帝国主义侵朝战争的摧残，绝大部分都衰弱多病，营养不良。当时，吉林市人民政府立即组织医生普遍进行体格检查，针对具体情况进行治疗和加强营养。几个月后，战灾儿童们的健康迅速恢复，体重普遍提高，有的在半年中就增加了六公斤。
    同时，政府又拨出巨款，在北山脚下按学院的需要，设计修建了七、八幢校舍。市人民政府建设局长亲自到工地担任工地主任。建筑工人知道这是为朝鲜战灾孤儿修建的学校时，马上日夜赶工，结果只两个多月就全部完工，使朝鲜孤儿早日迁到新校舍学习。新校舍里有教室、礼堂、实验室、音乐室、宿舍、食堂、医务所、浴室、理发室等等。另外，还有一个播音室，并在各宿舍里安装着喇叭，他们可以每天收听到朝鲜人民广播电台的广播。
    学院的教学设备也很齐全。在物理、化学、生物等实验室中，都有足够学生应用的实验设备，其中还有比较贵重的矿物分析器、显微镜等。学院中还建立了一个小型的气象观测站。学院指导员廉泰玉高兴地对记者说：“由于中朝两国政府和人民的关怀，我们的儿童迅速成长起来，去年已经有二十五名学生第一次从这个学院毕业，他们大部分都已经回国进入大学深造，或者参加祖国的建设工作。”
    朝鲜孤儿在这里处处感到温暖。吉林市党、政领导人经常带着各种礼品到学院里来看望他们。去年7月，学院学生们到永吉县口前区野游时，附近的农业生产合作社社员们给孤儿们送来了锦旗、镜子、三百多斤朝鲜打糕、大肥猪和大量汽水等。有一个七十岁的老大娘带了礼品走了八十五里路赶来看望孤儿们。她的一个儿子在抗美援朝时牺牲在朝鲜。当她看到孤儿们时，笑着流下泪来，她说：“看到你们就像看到我自己的儿子一样的高兴！”
    朝鲜人遗子女学院学生们和吉林市很多中国学校建立了深厚的友谊。
    最近传来了朝鲜战灾儿童即将回国的消息后，两国学生都依依不舍。前些天，学院的五百多名学生和中国学生一起来到北山的革命烈士纪念塔前，围绕着纪念塔植树造林。一个中国学生和一个朝鲜学生合栽一棵松树，他们还在树下用石子铺成“中朝友谊”字样。两天内他们一起栽植了近二千棵树，并且把它命名为“中朝友谊林”。学生们分别时都紧紧握手、拥抱，记下了对方的通讯地址，并且互相勉励献身于祖国的社会主义建设事业。
