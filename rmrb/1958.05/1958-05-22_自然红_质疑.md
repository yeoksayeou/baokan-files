Questioning "Natural Redness"
　　Liudi

Recently, I received letters from several comrades who have been sent to the countryside, saying that they have begun to get used to agricultural labor and rural life. Seeing this, I felt unspeakably happy. The image of the weak and delicate intellectual has been transformed into a healthy and simple new type of farmer. However, some people also said in their letters: "Labor training is not as difficult as I imagined before. Although it is a bit bitter and tiring, after a year or two, one will naturally become red."

The idea of "naturally becoming red" has been heard more than once recently. In the ideological revolution campaigns in government offices and schools, some people also say that it is easier to become red than to become expert. The reason is: "One takes the color of one's company." Living in today's society, as long as one does not oppose socialism, one will naturally become red. "Where can there be white in a red dye vat?"

The "natural redness" theory sounds plausible, but it is actually specious. It is true that our society is red, but this does not mean that everyone living in a red society is red. The working class is a red class, but without the arming of Marxism, it would not be possible for the working class to naturally become a class for itself from a class in itself. If the working class is like this, then how can intellectuals from other classes not be?

If intellectuals want to train themselves to become strong communist fighters, they must transform their ideology and eliminate capitalism and promote proletarian ideology. However, to be reborn and break the old and establish the new is not easy. This requires self-awareness, determination, and perseverance in self-transformation. Participating in labor training is only a favorable condition for the individual. People have different attitudes towards this favorable condition. Don't we see that among the ranks of those going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, there are also some people whose motives and attitudes are not quite right? Some people go to the production front with heavy burdens; some are prepared to grit their teeth and get through this; and some hold a "gilding" attitude, wanting to get a golden signboard. In labor, while fighting against nature, people's thoughts are also filled with the struggle to eliminate capitalism and promote proletarian ideology. Isn't that so? Under the scorching sun, when "sweat drips down into the soil," when the waist is sore, the legs are painful, and blisters appear on the hands and feet, when old ideas of despising labor and despising workers and peasants quietly strike, people have different feelings. How can one spontaneously develop new thoughts and feelings without going through ideological struggle and without being tempered and refined?

The "natural redness" theorists are, in essence, the abolitionists of ideological transformation. Although these comrades' subjective motives are still for "redness," they do not have the true determination and awareness to become red when they throw themselves into the furnace of labor. The surrounding red light is shining brightly, illuminating people's faces, but it does not necessarily soak into people's hearts. If one is in the countryside but one's heart is in the city, then one can only be red on the outside but not on the inside. It is gratifying that the skin is tanned and the strength is increased. However, to become thoroughly red, one must truly obtain the qualifications of the working people in terms of ideological consciousness.

Only by earnestly transforming oneself in labor training and resolving to eliminate bourgeois individualism, and "training" oneself to become red, is the right path. Waiting for "natural redness" is like waiting for a hare to crash into a tree stump. "Natural redness" is nothing more than self-deception and will not lead to any good results.

    “自然红”质疑
　　柳地
    最近，收到几位下放的同志来信，说他们已经开始习惯了农业劳动和农村生活。看到这些，心里有说不出来的高兴，印象中那弱不禁风、娇气十足的知识分子，一变而为健康朴实的新型农民了。不过，也有人在信上说：“劳动锻炼并没有以前想像的那么困难，虽然苦一点，累一些，但过上一年半载，自然而然就会红了。”
    “自然而然地会红”，这论调，近来不止一次听到。在机关、学校的思想革命运动中，也有人说，红要比专容易。原因是：“近朱者赤”，生活在今天的社会里，只要不反对社会主义，自然就会红。“红色的染缸里哪里有白色？”
    “自然红”论，听来振振有词，其实似是而非。不错，我们的社会是红色的，但这并不能说，生活在红色社会里的人都是红色的。工人阶级是红色的阶级，如果没有马克思主义思想来武装，工人阶级也不可能由自在的阶级自然而然地成为自为的阶级。工人阶级尚且如此，出身于其他阶级的知识分子又何尝不是如此？
    知识分子要把自己锻炼成坚强的共产主义战士，必须改造思想，灭资兴无。可是，要脱胎换骨，破旧立新，说来也不容易。这需要有自我改造的自觉、决心和毅力。参加劳动锻炼，对本人说来，这只是一种有利的条件。如何对待这种有利条件，人们的态度各有不同。不见在上山下乡的行列中，也有一部分人的动机和态度是不怎么对头的吗？有人背着沉重的包袱走上生产战线；有人准备咬咬牙挺过这一关；也有人抱着“镀金”的态度，想混一块金字招牌。劳动中，在和自然作斗争的同时，人们思想上也充满着灭资兴无的斗争。难道不是吗？在烈日照晒下“汗滴禾下土”的时候，在腰酸腿痛手脚磨起血泡的时候，在轻视劳动、轻视工农的旧思想悄悄袭来的时候，人们的感受各有不同。这岂能不经过思想斗争、不需要千锤百炼，就会自发地长入新的思想感情？
    “自然红”论者，实质上是思想改造的取消论者。这些同志虽然主观动机也还是为了“红”，但他们投身在劳动的熔炉中，却没有真正红的决心和自觉。周围红光闪闪，光耀夺目，照红了人们的脸，却未必就浸红了人们的心。如果身在农村，心在城市，那只能是外红里不红。皮肤晒黑了，力气增大了，这都可喜。但是，要红透，还得真正从思想意识上取得劳动人民的资格。
    只有在劳动锻炼中认真改造自己，决心消除资产阶级个人主义，把自己“锻炼红”，才是正路。坐等“自然红”，就如同守株待兔。“自然红”，不过是自欺欺人而已，没有什么好结果。
