The Sixth Plenary (Enlarged) Session of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party achieved a complete victory in the struggle against the anti-Party clique headed by Zheng Dun, member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and Minister of the Organization Department, and Wang Jingru, Deputy Minister. After fully exposing and criticizing the criminal activities of the Zheng Dun and Wang Jingru anti-Party clique, the plenary session unanimously passed a resolution to expel rightists Zheng Dun and Wang Jingru from the Party.

According to the revealed materials, Zheng Dun, a class alien element from a bureaucratic landlord family, is a long-term hidden agent of the exploiting class within the Party, a political ambitionist and conspirator. His ambitious activities began as early as 1948 during the period of underground armed struggle in Yunnan. After the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, under the leadership of the Central Committee, successfully carried out the struggle against localism in 1954, Zheng Dun, despite the Party's continuous education and patient waiting, adopted double-dealing tactics toward the Party, feigning compliance while acting in opposition. He styled himself as the "leader" of local cadres in Yunnan, tried his best to use the residual influence of localism, cultivated personal power, and persisted in anti-Party activities. During the high tide of the socialist revolution in 1956, he colluded with Wang Jingru, a degenerate element who had fallen from serious bourgeois individualism, to form an anti-Party clique, expand their influence, and launch a frenzied attack on the Party. This group had a complete set of reactionary political programs aimed at usurping the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, changing the nature of the Party, and paving the way for the restoration of the bourgeoisie. Because they occupied the position of the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, they carried out anti-Party activities in an organized manner, which caused particularly serious harm to the Party.

It can be seen from the revealed materials that one of the vicious methods of the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique was to achieve their goal of breaking through the Party's positions from within the fortress through localism, sectarianism, and anti-Party cadre policies. Therefore, the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique, on the one hand, used the most despicable means to attack, exclude, and frame cadres who were loyal to the Party's cause, especially veteran cadres who had been tested for a long time. They declared that veteran cadres "had no culture" and that a redemption policy should be adopted to allow them to retire and "enter the museum." They used various excuses to suppress the role of veteran cadres, and even used the name of suppressing counter-revolutionaries and examining cadres to create rumors and attempt to frame several members of the Provincial Party Committee and first secretaries of the Prefectural Party Committees, in order to harm the Party's backbone. On the other hand, they won over all elements who were dissatisfied with the Party, and people with serious localism and individualism, even protecting and heavily employing landlords, rich peasants, and counter-revolutionary elements, cultivating cronies, and under the guise of cherishing new forces, promoted a large number of un-reformed bourgeois intellectuals as their personal tools for anti-Party activities. They also used the blindness of some cadres with localist sentiments and wavering Party members to expand the anti-Party influence of their group. They deceived the Provincial Party Committee, used their power to set up their strongholds within the Party organization, from the provincial-level organs to the prefectural and municipal Party committees, dispatching the backbone of the anti-Party clique to occupy leading positions. It has now been verified that within the Organization Department of the Provincial Party Committee, seven rightist elements who had served as section chiefs and deputy section chiefs, and several class alien elements and bad elements, were all promoted by Zheng and Wang and used as cronies and backbones.

Between 1956 and 1957, when the socialist revolution was at its height nationwide and the domestic class struggle was intense, the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique used the international revisionist trend of thought, the Hungarian incident, and the attack on the Party by rightist elements in society to launch two fierce anti-Party climaxes. In order to realize their political ambition of usurping the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the Zheng and Wang clique, during the preparation and convening of the provincial and county party representative conferences in 1956, violated the correct instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, fanned the flames everywhere, revised the Party's principle of democratic centralism, promoted "complete democracy" and "democracy without formality," created chaos within the Party, and attempted to fish in troubled waters. At the provincial party congress, the traitor Wang Jingru openly used the pretext of fully promoting democracy in his speech to incite representatives to oppose the Provincial Party Committee, and even degenerated to using the despicable means of anonymous letters to attack the presidium of the congress.

Another anti-Party climax of the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique was after the Hungarian incident in 1956 and when the rightist elements attacked the Party. On the one hand, the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique used the individual shortcomings after the province achieved victory in advanced cooperativization to exaggerate the so-called "dark side," led their cronies, dispatched "backbones," and searched everywhere for the so-called "darkness" in the countryside, spreading the poison of "invincibility theory" everywhere, and slandering the socialist revolution as a black mess, thereby launching a fierce attack on the grass-roots organizations in the countryside, emphasizing the "division of labor between the Party and the cooperative" in the countryside, using large-scale streamlining methods to expel grass-roots worker-peasant cadres, and personally going to the countryside to experiment in an attempt to abolish the leadership of the branch over the cooperative, so that the branch would be separated from political tasks, in order to disintegrate the Party's grass-roots organizations.

According to the revelations, Zheng Dun and Wang Jingru, who usually pretended to be simple and hardworking hypocrites, were also morally corrupt in their private lives. The meeting unanimously held that the exposure of the Zheng and Wang anti-Party clique and their removal from the Party ranks was a great victory for the Party organization in Yunnan under the correct leadership of the Central Committee.

    云南省委揭露一个反党集团
    组织部长郑敦副部长王镜如被开除出党
    本报讯　中共云南省委第六次全体（扩大）会议，取得了对隐藏在党内的、以省委常委、省委组织部部长郑敦、副部长王镜如为首的反党集团斗争的完全胜利。全体会议在充分揭露和批判了郑敦、王镜如反党集团的罪恶活动之后，一致通过了开除右派分子郑敦、王镜如党籍的决议。
    根据揭发的材料说明：出身于官僚地主家庭的阶级异己分子郑敦、是长期隐藏于党内的剥削阶级的代理人，政治野心家和阴谋家。他的野心活动早在1948年云南地下武装斗争时期即已开始，1954年云南省委在中央领导下胜利地进行了反地方主义的斗争以后，虽经党的不断教育和耐心等待、郑敦却对党采取两面派的手法，阳奉阴违，以云南地方干部的“领袖”自居，竭力利用地方主义的遗留影响，培植个人势力，坚持反党活动。1956年社会主义革命高潮时，与由严重资产阶级个人主义发展而堕落的蜕化变质分子王镜如，结成反党集团，扩张党羽，向党进行了猖狂的进攻。这个集团有着一整套旨在篡夺省委领导，改变党的性质，从而为资产阶级复辟铺平道路的反动政治纲领，并且由于他们窃居了省委组织部的阵地，有组织地进行反党活动，因而给党造成的危害也特别严重。
    从揭发的材料中可以看出：郑、王反党集团毒辣的手法之一，是通过地方主义、宗派主义、反党的干部政策，来实现其从堡垒内部来攻破党的阵地的目的，因此，郑、王反党集团一方面不惜以最卑劣的手段，打击、排斥和陷害忠实于党的事业的干部，特别是经过长期考验的老干部，他们宣称老干部“没有文化”，应该采取赎买政策让其退休，“进博物馆”。以各种借口抑制老干部的作用，甚至以肃反、审干为名，制造谣言，企图陷害几个省委委员和地委第一书记，来伤害党的骨干；一方面笼络一切对党不满分子，和地方主义、个人主义严重的人，以至包庇，重用地主、富农、反革命分子，培植亲信，并在爱护新生力量的美名之下，大批提拔未经改造的资产阶级知识分子，作为他们反党的个人工具。他们并利用一部分地方主义情绪的干部和意志不坚定的党员的盲目性，扩大其集团的反党影响。他们蒙蔽省委，利用职权在党的组织内安设自己的据点，从省级机关以至发展到地、市委，派遣反党集团的骨干，占据领导职位。现经查明，省委组织部内，七个曾任处长、副处长的右派分子和几个阶级异己分子、坏分子，都是由郑、王一手提拔，并作为骨干使用的亲信、
    郑、王反党集团在1956年至1957年间，全国社会主义革命高潮，国内阶级斗争剧烈之际，利用国际上修正主义思潮，匈牙利事件和社会上右派分子的向党进攻，发起了两次猛烈的反党高峰。郑、王为了实现其篡夺省委领导的政治野心，利用1956年省、县党员代表大会的准备和召开期间，违反省委的正确指示，到处点火煽动，修正党的民主集中制原则，宣扬“完全民主”，“不拘形式的民主”，制造党内混乱，企图混水摸鱼。在省的党代表大会上，叛徒王镜如在发言中公然以充分发扬民主为借口，煽动代表反对省委，甚而堕落地采用匿名信的卑鄙手段，攻击大会主席团。
    郑、王反党集团的另一反党高峰，是在1956年匈牙利事件以后和右派分子向党进攻之时，郑、王反党集团一方面利用全省取得高级合作化胜利后的个别缺点，夸大所谓“阴暗面”，率领亲信，调派“骨干”，到处搜罗所谓农村的“黑暗”，到处散布“无敌论”的毒素，污蔑社会主义革命为黑漆一团，从而对农村的基层组织进行猛烈进攻，强调农村“党、社分工”，用大批精简的手法驱逐基层工农干部，并亲自下乡试点，企图取消支部对合作社的领导，使支部脱离政治任务，以便于瓦解党的基层组织。
    根据揭发，郑敦和王镜如这两个平时伪装为艰苦朴素的假君子，在私生活上也是道德败坏的。会议一致认为：郑、王反党集团的揭发和把他们从党的队伍中清洗出去，是云南的党组织在中央的正确领导之下的一个伟大的胜利。（王甸）
