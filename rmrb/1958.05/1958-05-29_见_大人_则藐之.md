See “Big Shots” and Despise Them
Qiu Yin

Confucius said: "The superior man stands in awe of three things. He is awed by the decrees of Heaven, he is awed by great men, and he is awed by the words of sages." However, his descendant, Mencius, came out to overturn this sage's words, saying: "Speaking of great men, despise them. Do not look at their imposing appearance!" The three things to be awed by were suddenly broken by two, which is much more clever and promising than the great teacher. Throughout history, those who come later surpass those who came before, and this is one example.

Now it is a new society, and comrade-like relationships should be established and developed between people, with mutual respect, mutual assistance, and cooperation. It seems unnecessary to talk about "awe" and "despise" anymore; however, that is not entirely true. There are still some "big shots" who need us to "despise" a little, and those are certain bourgeois professors and experts. They practice the way of Confucius, considering themselves "superior men" or "big shots," wanting others to respect and be in awe of them; we should practice the way of Mencius towards these people: "Despise them!"

Why "despise them"?

Because: Now some of us "fear" professors and experts; and some professors and experts are also very imposing, wanting people to fear them, mainly because they think they have some "knowledge." However, judging from the many well-known facts now, their so-called knowledge is actually very problematic. There is no need to talk about those fake professors and fake experts who are incompetent and engage in deception; let’s just talk about those real professors and real experts who have knowledge and skill. Their so-called knowledge also has problems: First, what they learned in the old era from thread-bound books and Western-style books is feudalism and capitalism, which is fundamentally incompatible with the requirements of socialist transformation and construction. Second, their stuff has indeed become a "set," often trapping their own minds, making it difficult for them to accept new things. Many things and principles that ordinary workers, peasants, and even young students understand now, some celebrities and scholars do not understand or are unwilling to understand; it is even more difficult for them to use their knowledge to serve politics and production, and to seek creation and invention from practice. Now, it can often be seen in newspapers that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and petty intellectuals have made many amazing creations and inventions in the great leap forward of socialist construction, while those professors and experts locked in their studies cannot produce anything worthwhile. Third, it would be fine if they couldn't produce anything worthwhile, but they are still so imposing, regarding their stuff as "rare commodities to hoard," using it as a tool for fame and gain, and as capital to maintain and develop bourgeois individualism... With these three points, shouldn't they be "despised"!

If we conduct some research in academic history, we can see even more clearly that there have never been many people among bourgeois professors and experts who are worthy of respect; as for people who are great enough to inspire "awe," it can be said that there is not even one. The vast majority of great scholars and great inventors in history were not born as noble professors or experts, but were born of humble origins and were considered "incompetent." This is a historical fact. Many professors and experts often only inherit, recite, and peddle antiques in academic history in a mediocre way, and some people even cling to antiques to resist the truth and suppress new forces. The people who create and invent are those young people who dare to grasp the truth and despise antiques. Hegel, whom some philosophy professors worship as a god, was only a middle school teacher. Becoming a professor came later. He created a set of dialectical theories, which is indeed remarkable, but his dialectics are idealistic, "head down, feet up." Later, the young Marx came out to liberate dialectics from its upside-down state and "despised" Hegel as a "dead dog."

For those professors and experts who consider themselves "big shots," letting people "despise" them more is actually very beneficial. It can break the blind faith in themselves, shake off the things that trap their minds, put down the airs of knowledge, and go to the worker-peasant masses to learn some real knowledge and skills.

Forming a new atmosphere of "despising big shots when you see them" in our society can eliminate superstition among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and petty intellectuals, break the mysterious view of knowledge, so that everyone is not bound by all old dogmas and foreign dogmas, dares to grasp the truth and despise antiques, thoroughly liberates their minds, and carries out creation and invention more boldly. Moreover, only in this way can our technological revolution and cultural revolution take root, sprout, blossom, and bear fruit more widely among the masses.

### 见“大人”则藐之

    见“大人”则藐之
    丘引
    孔子说过：“君子有三畏，畏天命，畏大人，畏圣人之言。”但是，到了他的后辈——孟子，就出来推翻他老人家这段圣人之言说：“说大人则藐之，勿视其巍巍然！”三畏一下子就打破了两畏，比太老师可高明、有出息得多了。自古后来者居上，这就是一例。
    现在是新社会，人与人之间应当建立和发展同志式的关系，互相尊重，互助合作，似乎不必再讲什么“畏”和“藐”了；但是，也不尽然，也还有些“大人”们需要我们“藐”一“藐”，那就是某些资产阶级教授、专家之流。他们行孔子之道，自居为“君子”或“大人”，要人家敬之、畏之；我们对这些人则应当行孟子之道：“藐之”！
    为什么要“藐之”？
    因为：现在我们有些人“畏”教授、专家；而某些教授、专家也很巍巍然，要人家畏他们，无非是因为他们自以为有点“学问”。但是，从现在众所周知的许多事实来看，他们的所谓学问其实很成问题。不必去说那些不学无术、弄虚作假的假教授、假专家，就说那些有学有术的真教授、真专家吧，他们所谓的学问，问题也不小：第一，他们是在旧时代从线装书、洋装书里学来的封建主义、资本主义的那一套，同现在社会主义改造和建设的要求根本不对头。第二，他们的那一套确实是成了“套”，时常套住了自己的头脑，要他们接受点新东西可不容易，现在普通工人、农民以至青年学生都懂得的许多事情和道理，有些名流、学者却不懂得或者不愿意懂得；要他们拿出自己的学问为政治、为生产服务，从实际中求得有所创造、发明，那就更难，现在从报纸上时常可以看到，广大工人、农民和小知识分子们，在社会主义建设大跃进中，做出了许许多多惊人的创造、发明，而那些关在书斋里的教授、专家们却搞不出什么名堂来。第三，搞不出什么名堂来还只罢了，但他们依旧那么巍巍然，把自己的那一套视为“奇货可居”，当做争名夺利的工具，当作保持和发展资产阶级个人主义的本钱……有了这三条，难道还不该“藐之”么！
    如果从学术史上来考证一番，就更可以看出来，从来在资产阶级教授、专家里值得尊敬的人，本来就不多；至于伟大得令人生“畏”的人，那就可说一个也没有。历史上的大学问家、大发明家，绝大多数并不是什么高贵的教授、专家出身，而是出身微贱、被认为“不学无术”的无名小卒。这是历史事实。许多教授、专家往往只是庸庸碌碌地承袭、背诵、贩运了学术史上的古董，而且有些人抓住古董抗拒真理，压制新生力量。而创造、发明的人则是那些敢于抓住真理、蔑视古董的后生小子。现在某些哲学教授奉若神明的黑格尔，也不过是个中学教师出身，当教授是后来的事情，他创造了一套辩证法的学说，确实了不起，但是，他的辩证法是唯心论的，“头朝下，脚朝上”的，后来年纪轻轻的马克思出来解辩证法于倒悬，对黑格尔则“藐之”为“死狗”。
    对那些自以为是“大人”的教授、专家来说，让人家多多地“藐”一“藐”，实在大有好处，可以破除对自己的迷信，摔掉套住自己头脑的东西，放下知识架子，到工农群众中去学一点真学问、真本领。
    在我们的社会里形成一种“见大人则藐之”的新风气，可以在广大工人、农民和小知识分子里破除迷信，打破对学问的神秘观点，使大家不受一切老教条、洋教条的束缚，敢于抓住真理、蔑视古董，彻底解放思想，更大胆地来进行创造、发明。而且，也只有如此，我们的技术革命、文化革命，才能够在群众中更广泛地生根、发芽，开花、结果。
