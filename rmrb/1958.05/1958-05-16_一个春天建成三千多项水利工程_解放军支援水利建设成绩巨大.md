Xinhua News Agency dispatch: This spring, the various units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have made great achievements in supporting farmland water conservancy construction. According to statistics from January to April, the entire army contributed 15 million voluntary labor days and completed more than 3,000 large, medium, and small-scale water conservancy projects. More than 300 water conservancy projects are currently still under construction.

　　In supporting the construction of rural water conservancy projects, the troops stationed in various regions were led by their commanders, and the entire line was mobilized. The leaders of the Shenyang Military Region, like deploying combat missions, spread out maps and directed their troops to carry out shock construction on various construction sites. Many troops in this area worked so hard that "the roosters didn't crow when they went to work, no smoke rose from the villagers' chimneys, they walked home quietly at night with the stars following behind, and they competed to be models working from dawn till dusk under the moonlight." After two months of hard work, they quickly completed more than 500 water conservancy projects, increasing the irrigated area of farmland by 1.06 million mu. The local government originally requested that the 88-li-long "August 1st" main canal of the Hun River irrigation area be completed in one year, but thanks to the round-the-clock efforts of the officers and soldiers, it was completed and put into operation in just 22 days.

　　The Guangzhou Military Region completed more than 3.39 million cubic meters of earthwork and stonework in advance, which can irrigate 2.4 million mu of farmland this spring. To support the leap forward plan of Shantou Prefecture, Guangdong Province—my country's first 800-jin special zone—to achieve a yield of 2,000 jin per mu ahead of schedule, the local garrison worked hard for 50 days and overfulfilled the 630,000-plus cubic meters of earthwork and stonework for water conservancy projects. This not only enabled these areas to be irrigated year-round, but also eliminated the threat of floods to more than 310,000 mu of farmland on both sides of the Hanjiang and Rongjiang rivers that run through the Chaoshan Plain.

　　The troops stationed in Tibet, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Chengdu, Kunming, Lanzhou, and other places supported fraternal ethnic groups in building nearly 200 water conservancy projects. A reservoir project of 340,000 cubic meters of earth and stone built by officers and soldiers of the Kunming Military Region for the Miao, Yao, and other ethnic groups was named "Minglang PLA Reservoir." Officers and soldiers of a border defense unit climbed more than 50-zhang-high cliffs in the primeval forests of the Banbeng mountainous area in Cangyuan County to blast stone and support the local people in building a 10,000-meter-long canal.

　　The broad masses of the people warmly praised the selfless labor spirit of the troops stationed in various places, who worked day and night. They named many reservoirs built by the army "August 1st Reservoir," "Army-People Friendship Reservoir," and "Army-People Unity Reservoir" as a memorial. Many people also thoughtfully sent water and charcoal, washed and mended clothes for the officers and soldiers who were building water conservancy projects, and composed many songs to praise the deep friendship between the army and the people. A folk song is popular in Leiyang County, Hunan Province: "Don't be afraid of another drought, there is water to irrigate the fields, the tanks are full of water, the granaries are full of grain, cattle and sheep go to the mountains in groups, don't forget the long grace of the People's Liberation Army."

    一个春天建成三千多项水利工程
　　解放军支援水利建设成绩巨大
    新华社讯　中国人民解放军各部队今年春季在支援农田水利建设中作出了很大成绩。据1月到4月的统计，全军共出了一千五百万个义务劳动日，建成大中小型水利工程三千多项。目前正在继续施工的水利工程，还有三百多项。
    各地驻军在支援农村兴修水利工程中，都是首长挂帅、全线出动。沈阳部队首长像部署战斗任务一样，摊开地图，指挥部队在各个工地上突击施工。这个地区的许多部队都是“上工鸡不鸣，民房无炊烟，夜静回家走，星星跟后边，起早贪黑把活干，月亮底下比模范”。经过两个月的苦战，他们迅速建成了五百多项水利工程，使农田灌溉面积增加了一百零六万亩。长达八十八华里的浑河灌区“八一”总干渠，当地政府原来要求一年建成，但是在广大官兵日夜突击之下，只用二十二天就完工放水了。
    广州部队提前建成的三百三十九万多土石方的水利工程，今春可以灌溉农田二百四十万亩。为支援我国第一个八百斤专区——广东省汕头专区的澄海等地提前实现亩产二千斤的跃进规划，当地驻军苦战五十天，超额完成了六十三万多土石方的水利工程，不但使这些地区可以常年灌溉，还使纵贯潮汕平原的韩江、榕江两岸三十一万多亩农田消除了水灾威胁。
    西藏、内蒙古、新疆、成都、昆明、兰州等地驻军支援兄弟民族修建了近两百项水利工程。昆明部队官兵给苗、瑶等族人民建成的一座三十四万土石方的水库工程，被命名为“明朗解放军水库”。边防军某部官兵在沧源县班崩山区原始森林里，攀上五十多丈高的悬崖绝壁打石方，支援当地人民修建起一条长达一万公尺的水渠。
    广大人民群众热烈赞扬各地驻军夜以继日的忘我劳动精神。他们把军队修建的许多水库命名为“八一水库”、“军民友谊水库”、“军民团结水库”等，作为纪念。很多群众还关切地为修建水利工程的官兵们送水送炭，洗补衣服，并编了许多歌曲来歌颂军民间的深情厚谊。湖南省耒阳县流行着这样一首山歌：“不怕天再旱，田里有水灌，水满罐，粮满仓，牛羊成群上山岗，莫忘解放军的恩情长。”
