    The Brilliant Achievements of Socialist Symphony
    ——After Listening to the Concert of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra
  　Li Delun
    The USSR State Symphony Orchestra, which Chinese music listeners have long awaited, finally met the representatives of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which was being held in Beijing, and Beijing audiences at the symphony concerts on the 17th, 18th, 20th, and 22nd of this month. Beijing audiences welcomed the performances of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra with extremely warm and excited feelings and cheers and applause.

    During these four days of performances, we can fully say that the USSR State Symphony Orchestra is a world-class symphony orchestra. It has a socialist realist performance method and also expresses the Russian national style in its performance art; this can be seen from the profound ideological nature of their performances and the particularly expressive and lyrical characteristics of their performances. In addition, what distinguishes it from other Soviet symphony orchestras is its particularly round and rich tone and the ardent passion in its performances.

    Their program included Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony, titled "1905," created to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, as well as Khrennikov's First Symphony. Both symphonies are expressed in extremely vivid modern musical language and complex forms, but the orchestra's conductor, Soviet People's Artist Ivanov, with his profound understanding of the work's ideology and great enthusiasm, and all the orchestra members, through first-class skills and deep emotional understanding, gave life to every phrase and every note of the entire piece, recreating the great revolutionary epic in the symphony. The audience also felt as if they were in a musical ocean of roaring revolutionary waves.

    The musical language used in Khrennikov's First Symphony is probably even more difficult than Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony, but thanks to the conductor, Honored Artist Professor Anosov's, high cultivation and clear understanding of the work's thoughts and emotions, we experienced the spirit, sincere emotions, and optimism of the Soviet youth expressed in the symphony.

    The program also included famous Russian classical works. Professor Anosov powerfully expressed the bright and heroic style of Glinka's "Ruslan and Lyudmila" Overture with extremely fast speed. The performance of Tchaikovsky's "1812 Overture" was the most satisfactory performance of this piece I have ever heard. The Chinese People's Liberation Army Band participated in the performance, and we were very moved when they jointly played the celebratory "Glory Chorus" at the end. This truly symbolized the close and united fighting friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. And Comrade Ivanov's conducting further increased the work's magnificent and vivid heroic spirit. Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony is relatively familiar to Beijing audiences; but this was the first time we heard a truly Russian-style performance. Professor Anosov's conducting revealed the deepest part of the work's ideology, and he also prominently expressed the work's desire for an ideal life and its tireless fighting spirit.

    It is worth বিশেষভাবে提出 to note that each performance included Chinese works. Comrade Ivanov expressed He Luting's and Ma Sicong's four short pieces, "Senjitema," "Evening Party," "Dance Beyond the Great Wall," and "Nostalgia," in a very brilliant and smooth manner. I myself have conducted Shi Yongkang's symphonic poem "The Story of the Yellow Crane," and have also heard other performances, but I always felt that the work was lengthy because it was handled relatively loosely. However, this time, under the direction of Professor Anosov of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra, with his strict logical handling of the structure of the music and his consistent spirit, coupled with the orchestra's many strengths in emotional intensity contrast, timbre changes, and rich expressiveness, it greatly exceeded previous performances. The flute soloist, Kharlunvsky, also gave a wonderful performance. In the performance on the 22nd, Bikakin, the winner of the recent International Tchaikovsky Violin Competition held in Moscow, rushed to participate in the performance. Many listeners still remember that he came to our country in 1950. His sound was very melodious when he played the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, and he showed his skilled technique and powerful spirit when he played the third movement. He is worthy of being an excellent violinist of the Soviet school who inherited the mantle of Oistrakh.

    The visit of the USSR State Symphony Orchestra to China will not only play an important role in further strengthening the fraternal friendship and cultural exchanges between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, but will also provide great support and influence to our country's musical activities. It has set a living example for us in the arduous task of establishing a socialist realist performance method with national characteristics in the future.

    社会主义交响乐的光辉成就
    ——苏联国家交响乐团音乐会听后
  　李德伦
    中国音乐听众渴望已久的苏联国家交响乐团，终于在本月17、18、20、22日的交响乐音乐会上和正在北京开会的中共第八次代表大会第二次会议的代表们以及北京听众见面了。北京听众以极为热烈而兴奋的心情和欢呼掌声欢迎苏联国家交响乐团的演出。
    在这四天的演出中，我们完全可以说苏联国家交响乐团是一个世界上第一流的交响乐团。它具有社会主义现实主义的演奏方法，在演奏艺术上也表现了俄罗斯民族风格；这从他们在演奏上的深刻的思想性和演奏上特别富于表情和歌唱性的特点上可以看出来。此外，它还不同于苏联其他交响乐团的，就是乐团音色的特别圆润丰厚和在演奏上的热烈激情。
    在他们的演出节目中，有萧斯塔科维奇为纪念十月革命四十周年创作的、以1905年革命为标题的第十一交响乐，还有赫连尼科夫的第一交响乐。这两首交响乐都是用极为生动的现代音乐语言和很复杂的形式表现的，但乐团指挥苏联人民演员伊凡诺夫以他对作品思想深刻的理解和极大的热情，全体乐团演奏员通过第一流的技巧和情感上的深刻体会，给全曲每一乐句和每一音符都赋与了生命，使伟大的革命史诗在交响乐中再现了。听众也宛如置身于虎啸着的革命浪涛的音乐海洋中。
    赫连尼科夫的第一交响乐所用的音乐语言恐怕比萧斯塔科维奇第十一交响乐还要难，但由于指挥功勋艺术家阿诺索夫教授高度的修养，对作品思想情感清晰明了的处理，使我们体会了交响乐中所表现的精神焕发、感情真挚以及乐观主义的苏维埃青年们的形象。
    节目中还包括了著名的俄罗斯古典作品。格林卡的“芦斯兰与柳德米拉”序曲，阿诺索夫教授以极快的速度有力地表现了此曲明朗豪迈的风格。柴可夫斯基的“1812年庄严序曲”的演奏，是我所听过此曲时最满意的演出了。中国人民解放军军乐团参加了演出，当他们在最后共同演奏庆祝胜利的“光荣颂”时，使我们非常感动。这的确象征了中苏两国人民紧密团结着的战斗的友谊。而伊凡诺夫同志的指挥更增加了作品壮烈生动的英雄气概。柴可夫斯基的第六交响乐对北京听众来说是比较熟悉的了；但是我们倾听到一个真正俄罗斯风格的演奏，这还是第一次。阿诺索夫教授的指挥展露了作品思想的最深处，他还突出地表现了作品对理想生活的渴望和不歇的斗争精神。
    值得特别提出的是每次演出都包括了中国作品。伊凡诺夫同志以非常光辉而流畅的手法表现了贺绿汀和马思聪的四首小曲“森吉得马”、“晚会”和“塞外舞曲”、“思乡曲”。我自己曾经指挥过施咏康的“黄鹤的故事”交响诗，也听过别人的演出，但总因为处理得比较松而使人感觉作品冗长。但是这次苏联国家交响乐团在阿诺索夫教授的指挥下，以他在对曲体结构上严密的逻辑性的处理和一贯到底的精神，又加上乐团在感情力度对比、音色变化和丰富的表现力上的许多长处，大大地超过了以往的演出。长笛独奏者哈尔润夫斯基的表演也很精彩。在22日的演出中，最近在莫斯科举行的国际柴可夫斯基小提琴比赛获奖者毕开金赶来参加演出。许多听众还记得他在1950年曾来过我国。他演奏柴可夫斯基的小提琴协奏曲第二乐章时声音非常宛转动听，演奏第三乐章时表现出他那熟练的技巧和有力的气魄，不愧为继承了奥伊斯特拉赫衣钵的苏维埃学派的优秀小提琴家。
    苏联国家交响乐团这次来华演出，不仅在更加密切中苏两国人民兄弟般的友谊和文化交流上产生重要的作用，并将对我国音乐活动给予巨大的支持和影响。为我们今后建立具有民族风格的社会主义现实主义演奏方法这一艰巨的任务作出了活生生的榜样。
