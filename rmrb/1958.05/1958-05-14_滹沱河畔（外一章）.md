　　On the Banks of the Hutuo River (and Another Chapter)
　　Chen Ge
    The Hutuo River flows quietly, carrying interesting legends and heroic stories, slowly flowing eastward before you. Looking at its fine, pale white waves, those once-stirring stories also surge towards you, stirring up waves in your heart.

    Time has passed. The Hutuo River water has also broken with convention and flows uphill. East of Huangbizhuang, a mobile boiler is pumping river water up the mountain. "Vigorously engage in water conservancy, divert water up the mountain, transform all dry land into paddy fields. Grain yield of 800 jin per mu, cotton yield of 93 jin, sweet potato average yield of 4,000 jin per mu. Work hard on water conservancy for two months, enjoy it for ten thousand years." This huge banner stretches from the north to the south of the village.

    It's almost dusk, and many women are sprinkling water on the neatly swept village roads. They have been working hard around the clock for half a month, building water channels, planting trees, and improving sanitation. At the village entrance, groups of children are surrounding the colorful archway, with several children holding ladders to paste paper flowers on the arch. This is the "Leap Forward Gate." On either side of the Leap Forward Gate are couplets. One pair is: "Ten thousand feet deep, we are determined to dig out water sources; Ten thousand feet high, we must divert water up the mountain." The other is: "Rather sweat ten more jin, than yield one less jin of grain."

    At dusk, on the hillside and by the riverbank, there are officers everywhere, shirts off, faces covered in sweat, planting trees for Huangbizhuang. One hundred and twenty people, wielding one hundred and twenty mountain hoes and shovels, planted more than two thousand saplings in just over two hours. When these poplar saplings grow up, interspersed among the apricot groves, there will be a new forest. As everyone laughs and talks, hoeing and returning home, the starry sky is covering Ma'an Mountain, making it look so tall. Is that warhorse, dragging this huge saddle, drinking from the Hutuo River, waiting for the rising sun to greet the morning glow and gallop eastward?

    Zhao Wang Terrace

    Two li west of the village is Zhao Wang Terrace. Legend has it that Lian Po once commanded hundreds of thousands of troops here to resist the Quanrong. Where is the terrace? Only a pile of yellow earth. The "Eight-Angle Glazed Well" at the foot of the terrace is now just a pile of rubble. The "Eight-Angle Fish Pond" has become a large octagonal wheat field, and the wheat seedlings have already sprouted. Zhao Wang Terrace was once a magnificent building in the city, but now the city is buried underground, and commune members are driving cattle to farm on the "city." It is truly "The border wind is fierce, the city is cold, the well paths are extinguished, the hills and ridges remain." The luxury of emperors and generals of past generations is gone forever.

    In the mountain gully north of the village, hundreds of commune members are digging black mud. Some are digging, some are pushing carts, stubbornly using the black mud to pad the hillside, to pad out a wheat field. The commune members have a soaring drive, filling the ancient land with the breath of youth. When they return from work, talking, laughing, and singing, passing through the village edges with peach and apricot trees, the red sun is gradually setting towards the western mountains. But this street poem on the village walls can still be seen clearly:

    "We love to sing
    Singing after collectivization
    Singing the Leap Forward song
    Singing that water and soil don't run down the mountain
    Singing that the yield per mu is more than a thousand gold
    Singing that cattle and sheep run all over the mountains
    Singing that the mountain gullies become golden nests
    Following the song to cross the Yellow River
    The songs of Jiangnan will be sung on the frontier"

　　滹沱河畔（外一章）
　　辰戈
    滹沱河静静地流，她带着有趣的传说，却还带着英雄故事，从你面前缓缓地向东流。望着她那细细的发白的浪花，那往日可歌可泣的故事也向你涌来，掀起你胸中的浪涛。
    时间流过去了。滹沱河水也打破陈规，向山上流去。黄壁庄东，一台锅驼机在抽河水上山。“猛干水利，引水上山，旱地全部变水田。粮食亩产八百，要摘皮棉九十三，山芋平均亩产四千。苦干水利两个月，享受万万年。”这条巨幅标语，由村北直贯村南。
    快近黄昏了，许多妇女在扫得很净的村路上洒水。他们修水渠、植树、搞卫生，通宵苦战半个月了。村口上，成群的孩子围着彩牌楼，有几个孩子扶梯往彩牌上贴纸花。这搭的是“跃进门”。跃进门两面各有一付对联。一付是：“地厚万尺决心挖出水源，山高万丈也要引水上山。”另一幅是：“宁可多流十斤汗，不能少打一斤粮。”
    黄昏了，山坡上，河堤边，到处都是军官，脱了上衣，汗流满面，为黄壁庄植树。一百二十人，抡起一百二十把开山镐，赶山锹，两个小时多一点，种了二千多棵树苗。等这些杨树苗长大了，夹在杏林间，又有一片新的丛林。当大家有说有笑荷锄归去的时候，星空正罩着马鞍山，它显得那么高大。那匹拖载着这巨大马鞍的战马，是否正在滹沱河饮水，待旭日初升，迎着朝霞向东方疾奔呢？
    赵王台
    村西二里路是赵王台。相传廉颇曾在此统帅几十万大军抵抗犬戎。台在哪儿？只有一堆黄土。台下的“八角琉璃井”，只见一堆乱石。“八角养鱼池”，成了八角形的一大片麦地，麦苗已长出来了。赵王台是当年城里的辉煌建筑，现在城已埋入地下，社员赶着牛在“城”上种田。真所谓“边风急兮城上寒，井径灭兮丘陵残。”帝王将相一代豪华，已一去不复返了。
    村北的山沟里，成百的社员在挖黑泥。挖的挖，推车的推车，硬把黑泥垫在山坡上，要垫出一片麦地。社员有一种冲天的干劲，使古老的土地充满青春的气息。待收工回来，说着，笑着，唱着，穿过桃杏成林的村边，红日已向西山渐落。可村里墙壁上这首街头诗还能看得很清楚：
    “我们爱唱歌
    唱罢合作化
    又唱跃进歌
    唱的水土不下山
    唱的亩产千金多
    唱的牛羊满山跑
    唱的山沟变金窝
    随着歌声渡黄河
    塞上要唱江南歌”
