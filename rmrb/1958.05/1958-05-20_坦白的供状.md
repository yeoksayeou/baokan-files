    Not long ago, the British "Financial Times" published a huge advertisement, occupying an entire page. The person placing the advertisement announced the establishment of an "Anti-Socialist Front" to launch a "ventilation movement." The advertiser made it clear that he hoped that in future elections, when Conservative and Liberal candidates appear in the same constituency and are evenly matched, the Liberals should abandon the competition and give way to the Conservatives. The British Conservatives are using advertising to seek help from the Liberals.

    What's even more wonderful is that this advertisement also contained a very frank "prediction," listing a "list of possible failures and endangered seats for Conservative MPs in the next general election: fifty-two are doomed to failure, fifteen are in serious danger, eleven are worth noting, nineteen should be careful, five cabinet ministers and twenty-eight government officials are in danger."

    The recent local elections in Britain have already shown signs, with the Conservatives losing some seats. This proves that the Conservatives' "prediction" is not without basis. The British "Co-operative News" commented on this situation and this advertisement: "It is a frank confession that declares the failure of Conservatism."

    坦白的供状
    不久以前，英国“金融时报”刊登了一个巨幅广告，占了整整一个版，刊登广告的人宣布成立一个“反社会主义阵线”，开展一个“通气运动”。广告主人明白表示，希望在将来的选举中，凡在同一个选区内出现保守党和自由党候选人相持不下的情况时，自由党人应放弃竞争，让位给保守党人。英国保守党人采用广告方式向自由党求援了。
    更妙的是这幅广告上还有一个很坦率的“预测”，列举了在下届大选中“保守党议员的可能失败和处于危境的名单：五十二名已命里注定完蛋，十五名有严重危险，十一名值得注意，十九名要当心，五名内阁部长和二十八名政府官员处于危境中”。
    英国最近的地方选举中已经露出了苗头，保守党人损失了一些议席。足证保守党人的“预测”不是没有根据的。英国“合作运动新闻”对于这种情况和这则广告的评论是：“它是宣告保守主义业已失败的坦白的招供”。
