    Who Bought the Radio?
    On December 20th of last year, the Fushun South Station called and said that a box of radios had been sent to our bureau from Shanghai and that we should pick them up immediately. We picked it up and saw that the waybill number was 54547. The sender was the Shanghai Joint State-Private Yifengtai Forwarding Business Office, the consignee was the Forestry Bureau, and the radio was an "East is Red" brand produced by the Shanghai Radio Factory. Then, we inquired within the bureau's various departments and the several forestry work stations and forest farms under its jurisdiction, as well as relevant units in the city, but no one had bought it. Later, we contacted the Provincial Forestry Bureau, but no one had bought it either. So, we wrote to the Shanghai Yifengtai Forwarding Office and the Shanghai Radio Factory to inquire, but we have not received a reply to this day. This box of radios is just sitting in our bureau, unclaimed.　　　　　　　Fushun Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry Yuan Guofang

    是谁买的收音机？
    去年12月20日，抚顺南站打来电话说由上海给我局发来一箱收音机，要马上去取。我们取回来一看，货运单上的号码是54547号，发货人是上海市公私合营怡丰泰托运营业所，收货人是林业局，收音机是上海无线电社出品的东方红牌。接着，我们便向局内各科及所属几个林业工作站、林场以及市内有关单位打听，结果谁也没有买。后来又向省林业局联系，也没有人买。于是，我们先后给上海怡丰泰托运所和上海无线电社去信查问，可是到现在也不见回信，这一箱收音机就搁在我们局里没人领取。　　　　　　　抚顺市农林局　袁国芳
