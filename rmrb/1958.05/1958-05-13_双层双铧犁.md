The double-layer two-share plow was created by members of the Advanced First Cooperative of Zengfumiao Township in Changge County. It is suitable for deep plowing in sandy soil and general clay soil. It is modified from an eight-inch walking plow, with a wall-less plow added behind the original plowshare. The front plow can plow to a depth of 20 centimeters, and the rear shovel deepens it by 13 centimeters. One person with two or three draft animals can plow three to three and a half mu per day, which is about twice as efficient as manual deep plowing, and saves one person and one animal compared to using two walking plows with one in front of the other.

　　双层双铧犁
    双层双铧犁是长葛县增福庙乡先进第一社社员创造的。适宜于沙土和一般粘土地深耕用。是用八吋步犁改装的，在原来的犁头后面加了一个无壁犁。前犁可耕深二十公分，后铲加深十三公分。一人用两头或三头耕畜，一天可耕三亩到三亩半，比用人工深翻土提高效率一倍左右，比两张步犁前犁后套也省一人一畜。
