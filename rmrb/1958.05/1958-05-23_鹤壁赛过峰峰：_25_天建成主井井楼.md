    Hebi Surpasses Fengfeng: Main Shaft Headframe Built in 25 Days

    (Our report) The entire staff of the No. 2 Engineering District of Hebi City, Henan Province, under the slogan of "Mounting a Thousand-Li Horse" and boarding a rocket ship, worked hard for three days to finalize the headframe design. Leading cadres implemented on-the-job labor, provided specific guidance for production, and strengthened the cooperation between shifts, groups, and individuals. As a result, they completed the main shaft headframe project of the No. 2 Mine in twenty-five days, on May 4th. The building area of this headframe is 557 square meters, and it is 27.15 meters high, with a five-story reinforced concrete structure. The workload was almost twice as large as the Fengfeng headframe project, and the project was completed two days ahead of schedule, creating a new national record.
