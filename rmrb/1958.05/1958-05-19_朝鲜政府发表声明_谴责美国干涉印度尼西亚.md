Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang: The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 17th, condemning the United States' interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The statement said that the U.S. imperialists' blatant act of infringing upon Indonesia's independence is not only a provocation against the Indonesian people but also a grave threat to peace in Asia.

The statement said that the Korean people fully understand through personal experience what consequences this kind of American scheme will bring. In South Korea, the United States created a puppet government and instigated it to launch a war of aggression. After the Korean armistice, the United States consistently opposed the proactive measures taken by the Korean and Chinese sides to peacefully unify Korea and ease the situation in the Far East. When the Chinese People's Volunteers took the initiative to withdraw from Korea, the United States was still attempting to permanently occupy South Korea with its troops and turn South Korea into an atomic war base for launching aggression.

The statement said that the American aggressors should not forget the historical lessons they learned in the Korean War. If they do not stop interfering in Indonesia, they will suffer another crushing defeat.

    朝鲜政府发表声明
　　谴责美国干涉印度尼西亚
    据新华社平壤讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府17日发表声明，谴责美国干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    声明说，美帝国主义者侵犯印度尼西亚独立的粗暴的干涉行为，不仅是对印度尼西亚人民的挑衅，而且是对亚洲和平的严重威胁。
    声明说，朝鲜人民通过切身体会完全知道美国的这种策划将会带来什么后果。美国在南朝鲜就是制造傀儡政府，并且嗾使它发动侵略战争。在朝鲜停战以后，美国仍然一贯反对朝中方面为和平统一朝鲜和缓和远东局势采取的主动措施。在中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的时候，美国还在企图使它的军队永久占领南朝鲜，并且把南朝鲜变成发动侵略的原子战争基地。
    声明说，美国侵略者不应当忘记他们在朝鲜战争中取得的历史教训。他们如果不停止对印度尼西亚的干涉，就将再一次遭到惨败。
