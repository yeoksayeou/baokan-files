Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th -- According to TASS, the joint statement by the Soviet government and the government of the United Arab Republic on the results of President Nasser's talks with Soviet leaders was signed in the Kremlin on the evening of the 15th. The joint statement was signed by Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, and President of the United Arab Republic, Nasser.

The joint statement said that during President Nasser's visit to the Soviet Union, the leaders of the two governments held cordial talks in an atmosphere of mutual trust and friendship. The talks covered issues of common interest to both countries, as well as a series of international issues and events that are currently attracting world public opinion.

The statement pointed out that the two governments are deeply satisfied with the close and continuously developing relations between the two countries, and they will continue to develop and consolidate this relationship in accordance with the following principles:

    Mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries;
    Non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries by any means;
    Resolution of international problems by peaceful means only, without the use of force or threats of violence against the sovereignty or independence of any country;
    Non-allowance of political and economic pressure;
    Equality of rights in the relations between all countries and peoples.

The two sides stated that the two governments adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and advocate ending the "Cold War" that seriously hinders relations between peoples of all countries.

The two governments condemn colonialism in all its forms and manifestations and support the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence. The two governments condemn the existing situation of some countries having military bases on the territory of other countries, and believe that such bases seriously threaten international peace and harm the independence of the countries where the bases are located; these bases should be abolished.

The statement said that the two governments discussed the issue of the rights of the Palestinian Arabs, their expulsion from their homeland, and the resulting violations of human rights and threats to peace in the region. The two governments guarantee their full support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arabs.

The two governments condemn the colonialist aggression against Yemen and attempts to interfere in Yemen's internal affairs. The two governments fully support the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Yemen.

The two governments condemn the inhumane war waged by France against the Algerian people and the crimes committed by the French armed forces against this heroic Arab nation. The two governments call on world public opinion to pay attention to the actions of the French authorities in forcibly expelling tens of thousands of Algerians from the border areas of Algeria and Tunisia. The two governments fully support the right of the Algerian people to self-determination and independence and resolutely call for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian question on this basis. The two governments are deeply concerned about the acts of some foreign governments interfering in the internal affairs of Indonesia and believe that such interference is a threat to universal peace and security and a violation of the United Nations Charter. The two sides declare that such interference should cease and that the independence and sovereignty of Indonesia should be respected.

The statement pointed out that the two governments advocate strengthening the United Nations as an organization. They believe that the People's Republic of China should have representation in the United Nations to correct the current abnormal situation, which will be conducive to international cooperation and easing tensions in the Far East and the world.

The statement said that the two governments reaffirmed their support for the principles declared at the Bandung Conference. The Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference held in Cairo in 1957 reaffirmed the Bandung Principles. The two governments also declared their support for the principles declared at the Conference of Independent African States held in Accra in April 1958.

The two governments are deeply concerned about the arms race. The two governments declare that, pending the conclusion of the necessary agreements or an agreement on the complete and unconditional prohibition of all nuclear weapons, all countries possessing atomic and hydrogen weapons should cease testing such weapons.

The two governments declare that atomic and hydrogen energy should be used entirely for peaceful purposes, and that countries should cooperate in this regard to improve the living standards of people of all countries, especially those of underdeveloped countries. The two governments believe that countries should redouble their efforts to conclude a practical and feasible agreement on significantly reducing the armed forces and armaments of all countries.

The two governments believe that the signing of mutual non-aggression treaties between countries is one of the ways to ease international tensions, and they believe that the signing of such treaties is in line with the peaceful purposes and principles of the United Nations.

The statement said that the two governments are convinced that the development of economic and cultural relations between countries should be encouraged. Such relations should not be accompanied by any conditions or motives aimed at one country dominating another.

The two governments declare that the economic and cultural agreements signed between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic are in line with these principles and are based on sound principles. The two governments also declare that they are fully satisfied with the development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries and trade between the two countries. In this regard, the government of the United Arab Republic expressed its gratitude to the Soviet Union for its significant contribution to the industrialization plan of the United Arab Republic. The two governments reaffirmed their determination to strive for further development of economic and cultural cooperation between the two countries for mutual benefit.

The two governments believe that artificial barriers to international trade should be eliminated.

The two governments expressed their complete satisfaction with the results of this meeting. The two sides believe that meetings and contacts between national leaders will strengthen feelings of mutual understanding and mutual trust and increase the possibility of resolving differences.

The two governments believe that the convening of a summit conference with the participation of major powers and some other countries is of paramount importance, and that this conference should be convened as soon as possible.

The statement announced that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic invited Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union Voroshilov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Khrushchev, and other Soviet leaders to visit the United Arab Republic. This invitation has been gratefully accepted.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th -- President Nasser of the United Arab Republic and his entourage, who were invited to visit the Soviet Union, left Moscow by plane at 8:00 this morning (Moscow time) to return to their country.
