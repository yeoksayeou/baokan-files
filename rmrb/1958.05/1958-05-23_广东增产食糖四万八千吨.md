Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 22nd: Guangdong Province's sugar refining industry recently concluded its 1957-1958 pressing season, producing over 429,000 tons of sugar, an increase of more than 48,000 tons compared to the previous season. Nearly 320,000 tons of this were produced by 69 mechanized sugar factories, with the remainder produced by over 10,000 traditional sugar workshops.

This achievement was obtained despite the insufficient quantity and poor quality of sugarcane. Under the slogan "Stabilize Pressing Volume, Increase Extraction Rate," the broad masses of workers launched a mass production upsurge and universally improved the sugar extraction rate. The average sugar extraction rate of the Zini Sugar Factory reached 96.58% in March, and on March 17th, it even set a national record of 97.28%.

The timely commissioning of the newly built Zhongshan, Nanhai, Huiyang, and Overseas Chinese sugar factories, each with a daily pressing capacity of over 1,500 tons, also played a significant role in this year's increased production.

    广东增产食糖四万八千吨
    新华社广州22日电　广东省制糖工业1957——1958年榨季最近结束，共产糖四十二万九千多吨，比上一榨季增产四万八千多吨。其中的将近三十二万吨是六十九座机制糖厂榨制的，其余由上万个土糖作坊榨制。
    这一成绩是在克服甘蔗数量不足和质量不好的情况下取得的。广大职工在“稳定榨量，提高抽出”的口号下，掀起群众性生产高潮，普遍提高了糖份抽出率。紫坭糖厂3月份的糖份抽出率平均达到96.58％，3月17日还创造了97.28％的全国纪录。
    新建的中山、南海、惠阳、华侨等日榨一千五百吨以上的四大糖厂及时投入生产，对今年增产也起了显著作用。
