Xinhua News Agency, 17th Dispatch from Vienna: The Austrian Communist Party organ "People's Voice" recently published an editorial criticizing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

　　This article points out that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia directly contradicts the views of the Austrian Communist Party.

　　The article points out that the draft program's views on state-owned enterprises in capitalist countries being so-called "socialist elements" under the capitalist system, and the apparent possibility of a gradual transition from capitalism to socialism, regarding the role of the state, the emergence of the socialist camp, the policies of the Soviet Union, and the role of the Communist Party, "can only be found among right-wing Social Democrats in Austria."

　　The article continues: Our party has waged an arduous struggle against the serious influence of reformism on the working class. In a struggle involving much pain and sacrifice, our party has grasped the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and it is applying these principles in Austria. The article says that the judgment made by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on issues of vital importance to our working class and the working class of other capitalist countries is an attempt to deny the struggle waged by the revolutionary working class in capitalist countries.

　　The article says: The draft program describes the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party as two parts of the workers' movement, saying that they each have their strengths and weaknesses. Every communist naturally understands that only a workers' party built on the foundation of scientific socialism, that is, Marxism-Leninism, can realize socialism. However, when discussing the workers' movement in capitalist countries, the draft program does not mention this principle.

　　The article writes: The League of Communists of Yugoslavia has not said what other forms of the "socialist movement" exist besides scientific socialism. Until now, we have not heard of other forms, either in theory or in practice. The article asks: The Austrian Social Democratic Party has now abandoned even the last vestige of Marxism. Does the League of Communists of Yugoslavia perhaps believe that such a party can win socialism for the working class?

　　The article writes: This draft program also opposes the existence of a socialist camp. The leaders of this league believe that such a strict dividing line cannot be drawn between capitalism and socialism. They deny the international class struggle, and they also deny the class struggle within individual countries. Instead of emphasizing the line between capital and labor, they obliterate this line. These are all incorrect and are a sign that it is distancing itself from other Communist parties.

　　奥共“人民之声报”编辑部著文说
    南共纲领观点同右翼社会党人相同
    否认资本主义国家工人阶级的斗争
    新华社17日讯　维也纳消息：奥地利共产党机关报“人民之声报”最近发表了一篇编辑部文章，批判南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案。
    这篇文章指出，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的这个纲领草案是同奥地利共产党的观点直接矛盾的。
    文章指出：这个纲领草案中关于资本主义国家国有化企业是所谓资本主义制度下的“社会主义因素”以及资本主义似乎可能由此逐步过渡到社会主义的观点，关于国家的作用、关于社会主义阵营的产生、关于苏联的政策以及关于共产党的作用等方面的观点，“在奥地利只会在右翼社会党人中才能找到”。
    文章接着写道：我们党为了反对改良主义对工人阶级的严重影响进行了艰巨的斗争。在痛苦和牺牲很大的斗争中，我们的党领会了马克思—列宁主义原则，它正在把这些原则运用在奥地利。文章说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在对于我们工人阶级以及其他资本主义国家的工人阶级有切身重大意义的问题上所作的判断，是企图否认资本主义国家的革命工人阶级所进行的斗争。
    文章说：纲领草案把共产党和社会党说成是工人运动的两个部分，并且说它们各有短长。每个共产主义者都自然了解，只有建筑在科学的社会主义，即马克思—列宁主义基础上的工人政党才能实现社会主义。但是纲领草案在谈到资本主义国家工人运动时，没有谈到这个原理。
    文章写道：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟没有说出，除了科学的社会主义之外，“社会主义运动的每种形式”究竟还有哪些种。直到目前为止，无论在理论上，或者在实践中，我们都还没有听说过其他形式。文章问道：奥地利社会党现在把最后一点马克思主义也放弃了，也许南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟认为，这样的党可以为工人阶级争取到社会主义？
    文章写道：这个纲领草案还反对有社会主义阵营存在。这个联盟的领导人认为，在资本主义和社会主义之间，不能这样严格地划分界线。他们否认国际阶级斗争，同样也否认各个国家内部的阶级斗争，他们不去着重指出资本和劳动之间的界线，反而抹煞这种界线。这些都是不正确的，是它自外于其他共产党的一个征兆。
