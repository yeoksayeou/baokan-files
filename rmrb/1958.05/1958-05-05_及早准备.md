    Early Preparation
    This year, wheat growth in various regions is generally good, and a bumper harvest is expected. However, a good harvest is not necessarily a successful one, because the "harvesting hurdle" has not yet been crossed. Only when the grain is in the granary and the straw is stacked can a successful harvest be considered a certainty. Therefore, making early preparations for the wheat harvest to ensure timely harvesting and that every grain returns home is a very important task.
    In addition to making early arrangements for the repair and manufacture of production tools and the supply of daily necessities, the most important aspect of wheat harvest preparation is labor allocation. The wheat harvest has always been one of the busiest seasons. This year, due to changes in the farming system, some areas need to sow immediately after harvesting, some need to intercrop, and some need to convert dry land into paddy fields, which makes the labor force even more strained. The solution, in addition to improving labor organization and tapping labor potential, is to find ways to manage the timing – staggering tasks that can be staggered and doing what can be done early. This will not only alleviate labor shortages but also ensure that tasks are done meticulously and thoroughly, with guaranteed quality and quantity. In order to ensure a bumper wheat harvest, all regions should learn from Xiangyang Prefecture in making early preparations.

    及早准备
    今年各地小麦生长情况一般良好，丰产有望。但是丰产不一定就能丰收，原因是还有“收割关”没过，必须等到粮上囤、草上堆以后，丰收才算定局。为此，及早做好麦收准备，保证按时收割，颗粒还家，是一项很重要的工作。
    麦收准备工作除生产工具的修制、生活用品的供应要早作安排而外，更重要的是劳力安排。麦收素来就是最忙的季节之一，今年由于农田耕作制度的改变，有的要随收随种，有的要套种，有的还要把旱地改成水田，这就使得劳力更加紧张。解决办法除改善劳动组织，挖掘劳动潜力外，还可以从时间上想办法——把能错开的农活尽量错开，能早做的尽量早做。这样既能减轻劳力紧张程度，又能做得细致扎实，保质保量。为了保证麦子丰产丰收，各地应该学习襄阳专区早作准备。
