    Another Letter to Young Readers
    Bingxin
     Letter Seven Dear children:
    Yesterday we returned to Switzerland from Italy, and tomorrow we are leaving for England. I should give you a summary of our three-week trip to Italy.
    We visited about twenty cities, large and small, in Italy. In a word, I really like Italy. First of all, its capital, Rome, is a beautiful and magnificent capital, just like our Beijing. Its ancient architecture, the sculptures and paintings in museums, and the unearthed cultural relics, like Beijing's architecture and museums, fully demonstrate the amazing wisdom of its working people! I will talk about Italy in detail when I have time in the future. Now, let me point out a few of the most prominent impressions to give you a rough outline.
    First: Europeans say that Italy is built with stones, which is a characteristic of ancient Italian architecture. The ancient Italian churches, palaces, castles, bridges, streets... most of them were built and paved with stones, at least the outside of the buildings were made of stone slabs or flakes; the vaults and walls were inlaid with figures of various colored stones and gems; there were stone statues on the roofs, fountains, and squares. At a glance, they give people a feeling of firmness, cleanliness, and coolness. There are so many beautiful buildings in Italy that can be described. What I like most are the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the cathedral, and the baptistery. This cluster of simple, exquisite, and solemn white stone buildings, arranged in harmony with each other in front of a corner of the city wall, makes people never forget them after seeing them!
    Second: When traveling in Italy, you can't do without water everywhere. Three-quarters of Italy's borders are adjacent to water, and there are many beautiful lakes, large and small, in the mountainous north. There are all kinds of fountains in every city, the most wonderful of which is the Tivoli Fountain Garden outside Rome. This fountain garden was originally a royal villa, built on a small mountain. There are six thousand fountains of various sizes in the garden, on the top of the mountain, on the pool, by the roadside... some are as wide as curtains, some are as thin as threads, the large ones rushing down like mountain waterfalls, the small ones spraying lightly upwards like silver flowers of fire trees. In a piece of clear light intertwined, and then hearing the staggered sounds of the springs, "large pearls and small pearls falling on a jade plate," this novel feeling is also unforgettable!
    However, what is most unforgettable is the lovely people of Italy! They are talented and passionate: this is reflected in their genius in literary and artistic creation, in scientific inventions, in their struggle for freedom and independence, and in their love for friends! The Italian people regard the Chinese people as their best friends. They care about us, love us, and they believe that our achievements are their achievements, our victories are their victories; every inch of progress of the Chinese people gives them immense encouragement. On the eve of our departure from Italy, in their heroic city of Turin, we were invited to a mass meeting—here it should be added: the city of Turin was liberated in 1945 under the arduous struggle of its own people. In this struggle, the number of people in the guerrilla forces who died was more than 47%! We had presented bouquets in front of the martyrs' tombs - this meeting was held in a workers' club, and the venue was crowded with enthusiastic men, women, old and young. A Chinese banner (written by the Italians themselves) with the words "Welcome Chinese Guests" was hung horizontally on the stage, and the long table was filled with glasses of all sizes. They gave us Turin's special honey-sweet chocolate candies and scarlet roses; they filled our glasses with fragrant Turin wine. Their words of welcome were sincere and warm. Every word of our reply was met with thunderous applause and cheers. In the middle of drinking and chatting, people kept coming over to shake hands and hug us; children kept handing us pictures and asking us to sign them—speaking of Italian children, they are really lovely! They are so innocent and lively, and so gentle and polite. In future letters, I will tell you about the very deep impression given to me by a little Italian girl. We are preparing to leave again. "Let's hear the next episode!"
    Our visit to Italy ended in the above-mentioned upsurge of enthusiasm. It was midnight when we returned to the hotel, and I couldn't fall asleep for a long time! The peaceful friendship between the working people of the international community is the most solid foundation for world lasting peace. In Asia, Africa, and Europe, we already have hundreds of millions of builders of the Palace of Peace, who are laying the foundation stone by stone. You are our successors, work hard and continue your efforts!
    I wish you health and happiness.
              Your friend Bingxin

    再寄小读者
    冰心
     通讯七亲爱的小朋友：
    昨天我们从意大利又回到瑞士，明天要出发到英国去了，三星期的意大利之游，应当对你们作一个总结。
    我们访问了意大利的大小二十个城市，说一句总话，我实在喜欢意大利，首先是它的首都罗马，和我们的北京一样，是个美丽雄伟的首都。它的古老的建筑，和博物馆里的雕刻，绘画，以及出土的文物，都和北京的建筑和博物馆一样，充分地呈现了它的劳动人民的惊人的智慧！关于意大利，将来有时间再详细的述说，如今先举出几个最突出的印象，给小朋友们画一个轮廓。
    第一是：欧洲人说，意大利是用石头建造起来的，这是古意大利建筑的一个特点。古意大利的教堂，宫殿，城堡，桥梁，街道……绝大部分都是用石头盖起铺起的，至少是建筑物外面都用的是石板、石片；仰顶和墙壁上都有各色花石宝石嵌镶的人物；屋顶上，喷泉上和广场上都有石像，一眼望去，给人一种坚洁清凉的感觉。意大利的美丽建筑，可描写的真是太多了，我最喜欢的是比萨的斜塔，教堂和洗礼堂。这一簇简洁、玲珑而庄严的白石建筑，相依相衬地排列在一角城墙的前面，使人看过永不会忘记！
    第二是：在意大利旅行，到处都离不了水。意大利的边界，有四分之三与水为邻，北部多山的地方，却有许多大大小小美丽的湖泊。各个城市里都有形形色色的喷泉，最奇丽的是罗马郊外的提伏里泉园。这座泉园原是皇家别墅，建造在小山上，园里大小有六千条喷泉，在山巅，在池上，在路旁……，宽者如帘，细者如线，大的奔越下流，如同山间的瀑布，小的轻莹上喷，如同火树的银花，一片清辉交织之中，再听到那“大珠小珠落玉盘”的大小错落的泉声，这个新奇的感受，也是使人永不忘记的！
    但是，最使人不能忘却的，是意大利的可爱的人民！他们是才气横溢，热情奔放的：这表现在他们的天才的文艺创造上，科学发明上；表现在他们为自由和独立的斗争上；表现在对朋友的热爱上！意大利人民把中国人民当做最好的朋友。他们关心我们，热爱我们，他们认为我们的成就，就是他们的成就；我们的胜利，就是他们的胜利；中国人民一寸一尺的进步，都给他们以莫大的鼓舞。当我们离开意大利的前夕，在他们的英雄城市都灵，我们被邀到一个群众的集会——在这里应当补一下：都灵城是在1945年，在它自己人民的艰苦斗争之下，得到解放的。这次的斗争，人民游击队死亡的数目，在47％以上！我们曾到烈士墓前，献过花束——这集会是在一个工人俱乐部召开的，会场上挤满了热情的男女老幼，台上横挂着“欢迎中国来宾”的中文标语（是意大利人自己写的），长桌上摆满了大大小小的酒杯。他们送给我们都灵市特产的蜜甜的巧克力糖，猩红的玫瑰花；给我们满满地斟上香醇的都灵酒。他们的欢迎词，是真挚而热烈的。我们的每一句答词，都得到春雷般的鼓掌与欢呼。在饮酒叙谈的中间，都不断地有群众过来和我们握手拥抱；不断地有儿童们送上画片，要求我们签名——谈到意大利的儿童，他们真是可爱！他们是那样地天真活泼，又是那样地温文有礼。在以后的通讯里，我要对你们谈一个意大利小姑娘所给我的极深的印象。我们又在整装待发之中。“且听下回分解”吧！
    我们的意大利的访问，就在上述的高涨的热潮中结束。回到旅馆已是夜半，我久久不能入睡！国际间劳动人民的和平友谊，是世界持久和平的最巩固的基础。在亚洲，在非洲，在欧洲，我们已有了亿万的和平宫的建筑工人，正在一砖一石地把屋基垒了起来。你们是我们的接班人，好好地继续努力吧！
    祝你们健康快乐。
              你的朋友　冰心
