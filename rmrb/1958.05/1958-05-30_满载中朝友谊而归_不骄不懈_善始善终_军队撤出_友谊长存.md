Returning Fully Loaded with Sino-Korean Friendship
　　Without Pride or Slackness, Finishing Well, Army Withdraws, Friendship Endures
　　Yang Yong, Commander of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army

　　The Volunteer Army will withdraw in batches from Korea completely before the end of this year, and the first batch of troops was completely withdrawn on April 25. The Volunteer Army's initiative to withdraw from Korea is a major measure taken by China and North Korea to promote the easing of international tensions and combat American imperialism, and it has been praised by socialist countries and peace-loving people all over the world. The American imperialists' conspiracy to obstruct the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue has been widely condemned, further isolating them. We, all comrades of the Volunteer Army, deeply know that the people of China and North Korea are as close as lips and teeth and share weal and woe. If American imperialism dares to provoke war again, at the call of the Party and when the Korean people deem it necessary, we will not hesitate to once again "cross the Yalu River valiantly and with high morale" to strike the invaders.

　　After the decision to withdraw the Volunteer Army was made, we carried out work in many aspects to further consolidate and develop the friendship forged in blood by the Chinese and Korean people. This will have a profound impact on the future joint struggle and long-term mutual assistance and cooperation between the two peoples. The Party Committee of the Volunteer Army, based on the principle of "no pride or slackness, finishing well; army withdraws, friendship endures," put forward the "three goods" for the withdrawal of troops, namely "good handover, good departure, good arrival." On the basis of rectification and socialist education in the past year, the broad masses of officers and soldiers, through mobilization and open debates, further enhanced their patriotism and internationalism, and set off a new upsurge of mass-based Sino-Korean unity and friendship.

　　Before the withdrawal, every member of the Volunteer Army competed to help the Korean people with their labor. One soldier wrote a poem singing: "Muddy water covers the body, no one cares about it, sweat pours like rain, watering the flowers of friendship."

　　In this upsurge, cadres took the lead and everyone competed to help the Korean people with their labor. "Putting in more sweat, leaving behind more friendship" has become the action slogan of the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Volunteer Army. According to the needs of the local people, various troops helped the Korean people on the spot to dig ditches, repair dams, sink wells, build houses, build bridges, build roads, plant trees, and build school buildings and public places, so that more people could benefit. Judging from the number of workdays, it was originally planned to work 300,000 days this year. Now, only four months have passed, and more than 700,000 workdays have been completed, exceeding the annual target by more than 233%. In the construction of water conservancy projects, it was originally required that each person complete 1.8 cubic meters of earthwork per day, but all units generally exceeded this quota. Sick comrades also actively participated, and they could not be persuaded to stop. They said, "It is rare to have the opportunity to help the Korean people with labor in the future, so we have to crawl there." Sometimes the work couldn't be stopped at the end of the day, and everyone wanted to do more. Some units used bright lights and torches, working day and night. They said that they were representing 600 million people to help the Korean people with their labor, and they did not rest even if their hands were blistered, taking pride in getting "friendship blisters." A soldier wrote a song praising the Friendship Dam: "For the Friendship Dam, we are not afraid of being tired; we take off our clothes and socks and dig soil in the water; muddy water covers the body, no one cares about it; sweat pours like rain, watering the flowers of friendship."

　　When the Korean people repeatedly discouraged the Volunteer Army soldiers from resting for a few days and letting them wash their clothes, they said: If you still don't listen, we will check everyone when you leave, and if anyone's clothes have dust, we will keep him here.

　　In particular, the intensive labor before the troops withdrew from their station left a deep impression on the Korean people. Many troops worked 11 to 12 hours a day in the days before leaving Korea. When local Korean party and government cadres and people saw that the troops were leaving soon, they always persuaded them to rest for a few days. A league chairman of a village said: "You have soiled your clothes during work, and you don't let us wash them. When you return to China, your Chinese mothers will say that the Korean mothers have not fulfilled their responsibilities. If you don't rest for a few days and let us wash your clothes, we will check everyone when you leave, and if anyone's clothes have Korean dust, we will keep him here..." But they couldn't stop the soldiers anyway, they always worked until the last day. An old Korean man exclaimed: "There is no Volunteer Army's blood on that battlefield, there is no Volunteer Army's sweat on that piece of land, there is no Volunteer Army's footprint on that road, and none of our food, clothing, housing, and transportation is unrelated to the Volunteer Army!"

　　Before the People's Army troops took over, the Volunteer Army achieved three "fulls": "jars full of water, stoves full of firewood, lamps full of oil," and also achieved three "no's": "no garbage, no snow, no weeds." Soldiers wrote on the glass bottles with flowers: "Sino-Korean friendship blossoms and bears fruit"; on the pots of evergreens: "Sino-Korean friendship lasts forever."

　　While handing over defense duties to the People's Army, we also handed over barracks, camp equipment, a large amount of materials and equipment, and complete sets of hospital equipment to the Korean People's Army completely and free of charge. Through the handover work, the high internationalist spirit of the broad masses of officers and soldiers was fully demonstrated. Before the handover, the forward tunnels, trenches, and bunkers were repaired, cleaned, and reinforced. The soldiers renovated the barracks and camp equipment, and painted the ceilings and walls brand new. The cement floors, tables, chairs, beds, curtains, and tablecloths were washed clean, the glass, electric lights, and oil lamps were wiped bright, the desktops and bookshelves were covered with white paper, new mats were replaced on the kangs (heated platforms), and the ink and dip pens were also replaced with new ones. Any uneven places in the barracks were leveled with soil. Welcome slogans written in Chinese and Korean and large colorful paintings reflecting Sino-Korean friendship were posted in the clubs, and some clubs were also arranged according to the style of the People's Army. The roads around the barracks were paved with gravel or fine sand and trees and flowers were planted, and some units also built new "Friendship Gardens." Before the People's Army troops arrived to take over, we achieved three "fulls" and three "no's": "jars full of water, stoves full of firewood, lamps full of oil," "no garbage, no snow, no weeds." The pigs, sheep, chickens, and ducks raised by the food units, and the grain, vegetables, and farm tools produced by themselves were all given to the People's Army's takeover troops. In the tunnel positions, the soldiers also patched broken dog skin mattresses into one, and used the cut-off edges to make insoles, leaving them for the People's Army. Many units, in order to hand over more fine grains to the People's Army, would rather eat more coarse grains themselves; in order to leave more firewood for the People's Army, they did not use hot water to wash their faces, but used cold water to wash their faces. Before the People's Army troops arrived, they vacated the best houses. When the People's Army troops arrived, they heated the fire walls and warm kangs, cooked food, and boiled water. The leaders led the troops to welcome them along the road with gongs and drums. Some units carried them straight into the house. Sending souvenirs to the People's Army became a spontaneous activity of the masses. According to a division's statistics, officers and soldiers sent a total of 74 kinds of gifts, more than 10,000 pieces, including commemorative badges, photos, pictures, brocades, diaries, pens, towels, washbasins, thermos bottles, etc. Many soldiers inserted flowers in glass bottles, writing on the bottles: "Sino-Korean friendship, blossoming and bearing fruit"; some wrote on pots of evergreens: "Sino-Korean friendship, everlasting."

　　The People's Army soldiers said: "You have done everything we thought of, and you have also done everything we didn't think of." "We have truly felt the warmth of internationalism."

　　Because the broad masses of officers and soldiers regarded the handover work as a political task, everyone "came up with ideas and thought of ways," organized on-site visits and mutual comparisons, so the work was meticulous and the intentions were profound. How did the soldiers view and understand the above work? Please read the quick-board poem written by themselves: "People's Army, Volunteer Army, one goal, one heart, two armies, one family, closer than brothers!" "Seven years of resisting America in the battlefield, friendship deeper than the Pacific Ocean, even if there are missiles that can shoot thousands of miles, how can it be as strong as unity?" How did the People's Army respond? They said: "You have done everything we thought of; you have also done everything we didn't think of," "Your enthusiasm for us is like brothers, we have truly felt the warmth of internationalism!"

　　Words of friendship were spoken again and again, tears of enthusiasm flowed again and again, and people reluctant to part saw each other off for another journey.

　　The first batch of returning troops received various assistance and support from the Korean people during the withdrawal. The Cabinet of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea made a special decision for this purpose, and Premier Kim Il-sung and the leaders of the Korean Party and state personally went to see off the first batch of returning troops. The Korean government dispatched the best train drivers and a large number of trains in the country to transport the troops. On all the main roads through which the withdrawing troops passed, there were Korean people everywhere carrying stones on their shoulders and soil on their heads, repairing bridges and leveling roads. When the troops set off, the masses near the station dressed up and lined the streets to welcome them, holding Chinese and Korean national flags, scattering colorful confetti, with gongs and drums beating and singing and dancing. The girls put a big red flower on each soldier, and the soldiers and the masses shook hands and said goodbye one by one. Many people held the soldiers' hands and refused to let go, just weeping and unable to speak. The photographers were also moved to tears and could not capture these moving scenes. A team of about 1,000 people took more than three hours to pass through the send-off procession of more than 500 people. The welcoming people led yellow cattle and white horses, vying to help the soldiers carry backpacks and transport luggage. Words of friendship were spoken again and again, tears of enthusiasm flowed again and again, and people reluctant to part saw each other off for another journey. An old man with white hair happened to pass through a village, and when he saw that the Volunteer Army was leaving, he didn't hurry on his way, but immediately helped the soldiers carry their backpacks, sending them back and forth outside the village three times. After the troops had gone far, he carried his own things and left. From the front lines through Pyongyang to Sinuiju, there were tea stations in every village along the way, and there was water for washing faces at every station. As soon as the troops arrived, the women delivered hot towels to the soldiers' hands and sugar water to the soldiers' mouths. Many places also prepared eggs, apples, chestnuts, and honey to give to the soldiers to satisfy their hunger during the journey. In the villages where the troops camped, the Korean people vacated the best houses, welcomed them far out of the village, vying to carry backpacks, and took the soldiers to their homes. The Volunteer Army received precious gifts from the Korean people in the stationed areas and along the way, including an old woman's wedding ring, the green hair of a woman, a sword passed down for generations, memorabilia carried during the wartime escape, soil from the Korean battlefield in cloth bags, elementary school students' homework books, embroidered sachets from girls, and straw sandals woven from women's hair. Every item was deeply affectionate. People were excited when they saw the gifts, and the letters were weighty and sincere. The soldiers expressed to the Korean people one after another, "If the United States dares to launch a war in Korea again, I will be the first to sign up as a volunteer and cross the river again to resist America and aid Korea."

　　An old Korean man sang while crying: Baekdu Mountain, Baekdu Mountain, Baekdu Mountain is high, but not as high as the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people; Yalu River, Yalu River, the Yalu River is deep, but not as deep as the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people.

　　The love and friendship of the Korean people for the Volunteer Army is hard to describe. Here are a few small stories. (1) There is a 66-year-old woman named Yin Mingjun in Zixia Cave. Her three sons all died during the war. After the armistice, the Third Company of a certain regiment lived in her home. They helped her with everything from spring planting, summer weeding, autumn harvest, and winter fertilizer accumulation. Later, the Third Company moved its defense. The old woman came to visit every year. When she heard the news that the Volunteer Army was going to return to China, she brought four chickens, 18 kilograms of chestnuts, and 5 kilograms of sugar, and walked for three days to visit the Third Company. After meeting, she burst into tears, and all the soldiers of the company were also moved to tears. (2) A Korean mute child raised by a certain regiment's was orphaned when his parents were killed by American planes, and he was deafened and mute by the bombing. The child usually helped the troops chop grass and feed the horses very diligently. The soldiers loved him very much and gave him a lot of things. He had more clothes than the soldiers. When he realized that the Volunteer Army was about to return to China, he was very depressed and stayed in bed for three days without eating. He got up four or five times every night to see if the Volunteer Army had left. When the troops withdrew from their station, the child cried and sent them off for more than ten miles. After repeated persuasion from the soldiers, he was reluctantly taken back by the commander of the People's Army's takeover troops. (3) After the garrison in Jiachuan Village withdrew, the Friendly Relations Director of the military headquarters went to inspect the discipline. When the people saw the Volunteer Army, they ran over and surrounded them, shouting loudly, "The Volunteer Army is not leaving, they are back again!" An old man pulled the director to his home, put a table full of food, and invited him to be a guest. The old man said while eating: "Your shadow, your enthusiasm, are turning in my mind every day. You have already left, and I can only think of you every night to warm my heart!" The old man sang while crying: "Baekdu Mountain, Baekdu Mountain, Baekdu Mountain is high, but not as high as the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people; Yalu River, Yalu River, the Yalu River is deep, but not as deep as the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people." Li Shouchang (72 years old), an old man who voluntarily guarded the Volunteer Army Martyrs' Cemetery, said to the director: "Go back and tell the comrades to rest assured, as long as I am here, I will take good care of the martyrs' cemetery. If I die, my son will take care of it, and if my son dies, my grandson will take care of it. Our descendants will take good care of the martyrs' cemetery for generations!" Hong, the instructor of Jiachuan Village, had stayed in the Volunteer Army Hospital and had received blood transfusions from the Volunteer Army. When he saw the director, he grabbed his hands and refused to let go, saying, "The blood of the Volunteer Army is still flowing in my blood vessels, how can I forget you!"

　　The close unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for the Party's line and policies. The principle of unity between the army and the people is the source of victory, whether at home or abroad.

　　In the days before the Volunteer Army decided to withdraw from the Korean front, there were moving scenes everywhere, countless moving stories, and endless moving poems and words. This kind of friendship as deep as the sea and as high as the mountain, this kind of feeling like flesh and blood, is really impossible to describe and express. The Korean people are a people with a high degree of patriotism and internationalism. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party, they have given us the greatest support whether in war or after the armistice. During the war, countless heroic deeds emerged to support us, such as Park Jae-geun, who sacrificed his life to protect our wounded soldiers, and Fang Xingfu, who rescued our wounded soldiers regardless of the safety of his own son. The images of countless great internationalist fighters among the Korean people will always live in the hearts of our broad masses of officers and soldiers. After the armistice, the Korean people still cared for us meticulously, helping us solve the training and construction sites and the land for planting vegetables. The high degree of internationalist spirit of the Korean Workers' Party, government, and people has left an eternally unforgettable memory in the minds of all our Volunteer Army comrades. Of course, this kind of friendship as deep as the sea and as high as the mountain, this kind of feeling like flesh and blood, is also inseparable from the fact that the Volunteer Army's thousands of people shed blood in wartime and sweat in peacetime, and wholeheartedly did good things for the Korean people. We realize that the close unity between the Volunteer Army and the Korean people is a victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a victory for the Party's line and policies. The principle of unity between the army and the people is the source of victory, whether at home or abroad. We must continue to maintain and carry forward this good tradition and do a good job in the future withdrawal, training, and other work.

    满载中朝友谊而归
    不骄不懈　善始善终　军队撤出　友谊长存
    中国人民志愿军司令员　杨勇
    志愿军将在今年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜，第一批部队已经在4月25日全部撤完。志愿军主动撤出朝鲜，是中朝两国为促进国际紧张局势的和缓和打击美国帝国主义所采取的重大措施，受到了社会主义阵营各国和全世界爱好和平人民的称赞。美国帝国主义阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的阴谋受到人们广泛的斥责，使之更加陷于孤立。我们志愿军全体同志深知中朝两国人民是唇齿相依，患难与共，如果美帝国主义胆敢重新挑起战争，在朝鲜人民认为需要和党的号召下，我们将毫不犹豫地再一次“雄赳赳、气昂昂、跨过鸭绿江”，打击侵略者。
    在决定志愿军撤军以后，我们从多方面进行了工作，使中朝人民鲜血结成的友谊，在撤军过程中得到进一步的巩固与发展，对于中朝两国人民今后的共同斗争以及长远的互助合作将产生极为深远的影响。志愿军党委根据“不骄不懈、善始善终；军队撤出，友谊长存”的方针，提出了撤军“三好”，即“交好、走好、到好”的要求。广大官兵在一年来整风和社会主义教育的基础上，通过动员和鸣放辩论，进一步提高了爱国主义和国际主义觉悟，掀起了一个群众性的中朝团结友好的新高潮。
    志愿军在撤离之前，人人争先帮助朝鲜人民劳动，一个战士写诗歌唱说：“泥水沾满身，谁也不理它，汗水如雨淋，浇开友谊花”。
    在这个高潮中，干部带头、人人争先地帮助朝鲜人民劳动，“多出一把汗，多留下一分友谊”已成为志愿军广大官兵的行动口号。各个部队根据当地群众的需要，就地帮助朝鲜人民挖渠、修坝、打井、盖屋、造桥、筑路、植树、修建校舍和公共场所，使更多的群众得到利益。从出工数字来看，今年预定出工三十万，现在刚过去四个月，就出工七十万以上，完成了全年指标233％以上。在兴修水利工程中，原来要求每人每天完成一点八立方公尺的土方，但是各单位普遍地超过了这一定额。有病的同志也积极参加，劝都劝不住，他们说：“今后难得再有帮助朝鲜人民劳动的机会，爬也要爬去。”有时收工也收不住，都想多干一点。有些单位明灯火把，昼夜不停。他们说是代表六亿人民帮助朝鲜人民劳作的，手上打了血泡也不休息，以打“友谊泡”为光荣。有一个战士写了一首歌唱友谊坝的诗：“为了友谊坝，再累也不怕；脱下衣和袜，下水把土挖；泥水沾满身，谁也不理它；汗水如雨淋，浇开友谊花。”
    当朝鲜人民一再阻劝志愿军战士休息几天，让他们给洗洗衣服无效时，他们就说：如果再要不听话　走时挨个来检查　谁的衣服带灰尘　我们就要留下他
    特别是部队撤离驻地前的突击性劳动，在朝鲜人民中留下了深刻的影响。许多部队在撤离朝鲜的前几天，每人每天劳动十一、二小时。当地朝鲜党政干部和人民群众看到部队快走了，总劝他们休息几天，有一位里的女性同盟委员长说：“你们劳动中弄脏了衣服，都不让我们洗一洗，你们回到中国去，让中国妈妈看见了，会说朝鲜妈妈没有尽到责任的。如果你们再不休息几天，让我们洗洗衣服，你们走的时候，我们就挨个检查，谁的衣服带着朝鲜的灰尘，我们就把他留下……。”可是怎么也劝止不住战士们，他们总是一直劳动到最后一天。有一位朝鲜老大爷赞叹地说：“那个战场没有志愿军的血，那块土地没有志愿军的汗，那条道路没有志愿军的脚印，我们的衣食住行那一样东西同志愿军没有关系！”
    在人民军接防部队来到之前，志愿军作到三满：“缸满水、灶满柴、灯满油”，又作到三无：“无垃圾、无积雪、无杂草”。战士们在插花的玻璃瓶上写着：“中朝友谊开花结果”；在万年青的花盆上写着：“中朝友谊万年长青”。
    我们在把防务移交给人民军的同时，把营房、营具、大量物资器材和医院的成套设备也完整无偿地移交给朝鲜人民军。通过移交工作，充分体现广大官兵高度的国际主义精神。在移交前，前沿坑道、堑壕和掩体都进行了维修、清扫和加固。战士们整修营房营具，将顶棚墙壁粉刷一新。水泥地面、桌椅、床铺、窗帘、桌布都洗得干干净净，玻璃、电灯、油灯擦得亮光，桌面和书架铺上白纸，炕上换上新席，墨水和蘸水笔也换上新的，营房内凡有高低不平的地方都用土垫平。俱乐部贴上中朝文字写的欢迎口号和反映中朝友谊的大幅五彩画，有的俱乐部还按照人民军的形式作了布置。营房四周用石子或细沙铺平道路并植树种花，有的单位还新建了“友谊花园”。在人民军接防部队来到之前，做到三满三无：“缸满水，灶满柴，灯满油”，“无垃圾、无积雪、无杂草”。伙食单位饲养的猪羊鸡鸭、自己生产的粮食蔬菜和农具都赠给人民军的接防部队，在坑道阵地中，战士们还把破了的狗皮褥子，几个补成一个，把剪下的边角制成鞋垫，留给人民军。许多单位，为了多交细粮给人民军，宁可自己多吃粗粮；为了多留柴火给人民军，不用热水洗脸，用冷水洗脸。在人民军接防部队到达以前，腾出最好的房子。人民军部队到达的时候，烧好火墙和暖炕，煮好饭，烧好水，首长率领部队敲锣打鼓夹道欢迎。有些单位把他们一直抬进房子。向人民军送纪念品，成为群众自发的活动。据一个师统计，官兵所送礼品共七十四种，一万多件，有纪念章、像片、画片、织锦、日记本、钢笔、毛巾、脸盆、暖瓶等等。许多战士在玻璃瓶中插上花，瓶上写着：“中朝友谊，开花结果”；有的在万年青的花盆上写着“中朝友谊，万古长青”。
    人民军战士说：“我们所想到的，你们都作到了，我们没有想到的，你们也作到了。”“我们真正体会到了国际主义的温暖。”
    由于广大官兵把移交工作看成政治任务，大家“出主意、想办法”、组织现场参观和互相评比，因而做到工作细致，用意深切。上述这些工作，战士们是怎样看待和理解的呢？请看他们自己写的快板诗吧：“人民军，志愿军，一个目标一条心，两个军队一家人，比同胞兄弟还要亲！”“抗美七年在战场，友谊深过太平洋，纵有导弹射千里，怎如团结一心强”。人民军又是怎样反映的呢？他们说：“我们所想到的，你们都做到了；我们没有想到的，你们也做到了”，“你们对我们的热情，有如亲兄弟一般，我们真正体会到了国际主义的温暖！”
    友谊的话说了一遍又一遍，热情的泪流了一次又一次，惜别的人送了一程又一程。
    首批归国部队，在撤军期间得到朝鲜人民的各种帮助和支援。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国内阁为此作了专门的决定，金日成首相和朝鲜党与国家的领导人亲自到第一批归国部队送行。朝鲜政府抽调了全国最优秀的火车司机和大批列车运送部队。在撤离部队通过的各主要公路上，到处都有朝鲜人民肩背石子、头顶沙土，修桥平路。当部队出发时，驻地附近群众盛装夹道欢送，举中朝国旗，撒五彩花絮，锣鼓喧天，载歌载舞，姑娘们给每个战士戴上一朵大红花，战士们和群众逐个握手道别，许多人拉着战士的手不放，只是流泪，说不出话来。摄影师也感动得热泪盈眶，以至无法拍下这些动人的场面。有一个一千人左右的队伍，通过五百多群众的送行行列，走了三个多小时才通过。欢送的人们牵着黄牛、白马，抢着帮我军战士扛背包、运行李。友谊的话说了一遍又一遍，热情的泪流了一次又一次，惜别的人送了一程又一程。有位白发苍苍的老大爷，因事路过一个村庄，一见志愿军要走，也不赶路了，马上帮战士背背包，往返送到村外三次，等部队走远了，他才背着自己的东西走了。从前沿阵地经平壤，到新义州，沿途村村都有茶水站，站站都有洗脸水，只要部队一到，妇女们就把热毛巾送到战士们的手里，把糖水送到战士们的口边，很多地方还准备了鸡蛋、苹果、栗子和蜂蜜，送给战士旅途充饥。在部队宿营的村庄，朝鲜人民都把最好的房子腾出来，远远地迎出村去，争着抢着背背包，把战士们接到自己的家里。志愿军在离开的驻地和行进的途中，都收到朝鲜人民送来的珍贵礼物，其中有老太太结婚时的戒指，有妇女头上的青丝，有祖传几代的宝剑，有战时背着逃难的纪念物，有用布口袋装着的朝鲜战场上的泥土，有小学生的作业本，有姑娘的绣花荷包，有妇女用自己头发编成的草鞋，件件东西，情深谊厚，看了礼物，人心激动，读了信件，语重情长。战士们纷纷向朝鲜人民表示，“如果美国胆敢再次在朝鲜发动战争，我第一个报名当志愿军，再渡过江抗美援朝”。
    一位朝鲜老人一边流泪、一边歌唱：白头山呀白头山，白头山再高，也没有中朝人民的友谊高；鸭绿江呀鸭绿江，鸭绿江再深，也没有中朝人民的友谊深。
    朝鲜人民对志愿军的热爱和友谊是很难形容的。这里不妨讲几个小故事。（一）紫霞洞有位六十六岁的老太太，叫尹明俊，她三个儿子都在战时牺牲了，停战后某团三连住在她家里，春播、夏锄、秋收、冬积肥，样样都帮她劳作，后来三连移防了，老太太每年都来看望，当她听到志愿军要回国的消息之后，带了四只鸡、十八斤栗子、五斤糖，走了三天特地来看望三连，见面后泣不成声，全连战士也都感动得落下了眼泪。（二）某团抚养长大的一个朝鲜哑巴小孩，父母被美国飞机炸死了，他也因炸聋致哑。这个孩子平时帮助部队铡草、喂马非常勤劳，战士们都很喜爱他，送给他不少东西，他的衣物比战士的还多。当他发觉志愿军将要回国时，心情很沉重，三天卧床不食，每夜起来四、五次，看看志愿军走了没有，部队撤离驻地时，这个孩子哭哭啼啼送了十多里，经战士们再三劝慰，才难舍难分地由人民军接防部队联队长抱了回去。（三）佳川里驻军撤离后，军部友好处长前往检查纪律，人们见到了志愿军，就奔跑着围拢上来，高声喊着“志愿军不走了，又回来啦！”有个老人把这位处长拉到家里，摆上满桌饭菜，请他作客。老人边吃边说：“你们的影子，你们的热情，天天在我脑子里转，你们已经走啦，我只有每夜想想你们，好暖暖我的心！”老人边流泪边唱：“白头山呀白头山，白头山再高，也没有中朝人民的友谊高；鸭绿江呀鸭绿江，鸭绿江再深，也没有中朝人民的友谊深。”还有位义务看守志愿军烈士墓的老人李守昌（七十二岁）对这位处长说：“你回去告诉同志们放心吧，有我在就把烈士墓看好，我死了有儿子看，儿子死了有孙子看，我们子孙万代要把烈士墓看好！”佳川里的洪指导员曾住过志愿军医院，志愿军给他输过血，这次他一见这位处长就抓住双手不放，说：“志愿军的血还在我血管里流动，我怎么能忘记你们呀！”
    志愿军和朝鲜人民的亲密团结是毛主席思想的胜利，是党的路线政策的胜利。军民一致的原则，无论在国内国外，都是取得胜利的源泉。
    在志愿军决定撤离朝鲜前线的这些日子里，到处是看不完的动人场面，说不尽的动人故事，听不倦的动人的诗话。这种海深山高般的友谊，骨肉般的感情，真是无法形容和表达出来。朝鲜人民是具有高度爱国主义和国际主义觉悟的人民，他们在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，无论在战争中或停战后都给了我们最大的支援，在战争期间，为了支援我们涌现出无数可歌可泣的英雄事迹，像献出自己的生命来保护我军伤员的朴在根，像不顾亲生儿子的安危、抢救我军伤员的方兴福，朝鲜人民中无数的伟大国际主义战士的形象，永远活在我们广大官兵的心里。停战后朝鲜人民仍然无微不至的关怀我们，帮助我们解决了训练、营建的场地和种菜的土地。朝鲜劳动党、政府和人民高度的国际主义精神，在我们志愿军全体同志心目中，留下了永恒难忘的记忆。当然，这种海深山高般的友谊，骨肉般的感情，也是志愿军千千万万人，战时流血，平时流汗，全心全意为朝鲜人民办好事分不开的。我们认识到：志愿军和朝鲜人民的亲密团结，是毛主席思想的胜利，是党的路线政策的胜利。军民一致的原则，无论在国内国外，都是取得胜利的源泉。我们一定要继续保持并发扬这个好的传统，作好今后的撤军、训练和其他工作。
