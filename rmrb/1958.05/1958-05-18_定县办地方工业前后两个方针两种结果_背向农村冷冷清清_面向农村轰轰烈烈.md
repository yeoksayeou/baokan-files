Our Newspaper, Ding County, 17th dispatch: Our reporters, Shu Ti and Fang Chen, report: The CCP Ding County Committee of Hebei Province abandoned its local industrial construction policy of one-sidedly pursuing light industries with large output value and high profits. After adopting a policy of primarily serving agricultural technological transformation and liberating rural labor, it received enthusiastic support from 650,000 farmers in the county. Ding County has become one of the counties in Hebei Province with the most successful development of county and township industries. In just over a month, 1,530 small and medium-sized factories were built throughout the county, with an average of 35 factories put into production every day. Among them, 1,172 small and medium-sized agricultural machinery manufacturing and repair plants, hydroelectric power stations, fertilizer plants, cement plants, brick factories, grain and feed processing plants, and other factories directly serving agricultural production were built. A county and township industrial network centered on agricultural production technology transformation has taken initial shape. All 39 townships and 400 to 500 villages in the county have agricultural machinery repair plants, and every village has repair stations and one to two granular fertilizer plants. Ding County can now ensure that minor repairs of agricultural machinery can be done in the village, medium repairs in the township, and major repairs in the county. In the past 40-plus days, Ding County's county and township industries have manufactured 34 types of simple coal gas generators, small tractors, and other agricultural tillage and irrigation machinery for local farmers, and repaired more than 118,000 pieces of farm tools and machinery. According to estimates, irrigation machinery alone can irrigate more than 200,460 acres of land in 12 hours, freeing up more than 68,000 laborers for intensive farming. The initial achievements of Ding County's development of county and township industries have filled farmers with confidence in the Great Leap Forward.

In early February of this year, when the CCP Ding County Committee began drafting the industrial development plan, it was only calculating how to make the industrial output value, which originally accounted for only 32.8% of the agricultural and sideline product value, exceed the agricultural output value this year. According to the draft plan at the time, it was planned to use more than 80% of the funds to set up factories that had little direct relation to agricultural production, such as wineries, sugar refineries, canneries, milk factories, and paper mills, which required less investment and yielded greater profits. For example, the plan stipulated that 39 wineries should be built in all 39 townships of the county this year, with an annual output of more than 14.3 million catties of white wine (an average of 22 catties per person in the county). Before this plan was even shown to the masses, they excitedly began to act on their own: they found a foreign student to design a chicken and duck farm. An average chick, worth only two jiao, required the construction of equipment worth twelve yuan, and a swimming pool was specially designed for the ducks. To build a milk factory with 100 dairy cows, cadres were sent to search for and purchase dairy cows. The county also transferred 120 cadres from the commercial, industrial, and agricultural departments to purchase agricultural machinery separately. They finally ordered 590 locomotive boilers from Liaoning, Liuzhou, Xi'an, Luoyang and other places, but before some purchasers had returned to Ding County, the orders they had signed were returned; because these machines were already in short supply locally.

During the two months of preparing for industry, the situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production throughout the county put forward urgent and specific new requirements for county and township industries. In order to realize the "guarantee of 800 catties, strive for 1,000 catties" leap forward plan this year, farmers unprecedentedly dug ditches and canals, cultivated deeply and meticulously, seized water from the land, and fought for grain with the sky. Since more than 1.44 million acres of farmland in the county have all been water conservancy, the agricultural labor force needed has more than doubled compared to the past, and the livestock power has increased by about eight times. Farmers are so busy that they "turn around the well platform during the day (pushing waterwheels) and turn around the mill platform at night (grinding flour and rice)," and generally feel that there is a serious shortage of labor. Some farmers complained to the county cadres, saying that "they suffered from having too much land," and some cooperatives even asked to give up hundreds or thousands of acres of land to other cooperatives, but no one wanted it. Farmers urgently demanded to add machines, liberate labor, and complained that there were too few mechanized farm tools and too little machine power, and complained that the county could not repair machines when they broke down. At the same time, farmers' desire for fertilizer was also very urgent. Farmers in every village reflected that "using five more fertilizer eggs for each sweet potato can increase the yield by five and a half catties."

The leading cadres of the CCP Ding County Committee had a more personal experience of the urgent demands of farmers in the process of going to the countryside to participate in agricultural labor. They pushed a large Bagua waterwheel with a dozen male and female members of the cooperative, irrigating only two or three acres of land a day. Therefore, they increasingly felt that the original plan for developing county and township industries was too far from the actual situation of agriculture. At this time, Hebei Province convened a local industrial planning conference to discuss the local industrial policies proposed by the central government and the provincial party committee. The thinking of the county committee members became clear, and it was clear that county and township industries must mainly serve agricultural production. After returning, the county committee analyzed the agricultural production situation and, after repeated studies, determined that the county's industrial development policy was to mainly serve the technological transformation of agriculture and the liberation of rural labor. The first priority was to grasp the manufacturing and repair of small agricultural machinery, followed by power, fertilizer, and building materials. Therefore, the industrial development plan was revised with "four grasps" as the guiding principle, and the struggle goal of realizing "nine modernizations" and "four networks" in the county within one to four years was put forward. The nine modernizations are: irrigation self-flowing, mechanization, electrification, mechanization of agricultural product processing, chemicalization of fertilizer, rubber tireization of transportation vehicles, mechanization of farming, mechanization of harvesting, and electrification of the county. The "four networks" are: telephone network, broadcasting network, transportation network, and telephone conference network. After the county's agricultural and industrial leap forward plan was drafted, the county party committee mobilized the entire party and the entire people to discuss it.

The draft plan for developing county and township industries centered on agricultural technology transformation and liberating rural labor immediately received enthusiastic support from cadres and farmers as soon as it met the masses. Many cadres and members of agricultural cooperatives said during the discussion: "Since the Great Leap Forward, everyone has been working day and night with great enthusiasm, but they always feel that there are not enough people and it is very difficult. After discussion, they realized that there was originally one leg missing (referring to the lack of industry). If there is this leg, it will walk faster." Many farmers said with joy: "This is really like picking up a waist tie while pushing a wheelbarrow, there is hope!" Soon, the upsurge of running county and township industries quickly spread to every village. When iron was insufficient, farmers throughout the county sold more than 3 million catties of scrap iron. Farmers in all 39 townships in the county also raised more than 4.28 million yuan in funds in less than a month. More than 10,000 skilled "local experts," demobilized soldiers, retired veteran workers, and teachers actively participated in the industrial construction of counties, townships, and cooperatives. Farmers in Dingningdian Village collected "two baskets of junk" - old wires, old machines, etc. - from various agencies and some factories in Ding County. After a day and night of hard work by the workers, they built a 10-kilowatt hydropower station. When this first hydropower station in the county built by farmers themselves started generating electricity, the local farmers were overjoyed, and men, women, old and young, ran around telling each other: "A hydropower station was built for more than 100 yuan, and electric waterwheels are used to irrigate the fields during the day, and small steel mills are used to grind flour at night." Carriages and horses from outside townships and cooperatives flocked to Dingningdian to visit first. When the farmers in Hufangdian Village heard that a hydropower station was to be built in the village, they automatically took out more than 600 silver dollars and a large number of building materials. In the process of building the station, they found that there were not enough bricks, so the farmers in the village immediately launched a brick-throwing campaign, throwing 8,000 bricks in one afternoon. When cement was insufficient, the farmers resolutely took more than 30 ancestral tombstone to replace the cement.

　　定县办地方工业前后两个方针两种结果
　　背向农村冷冷清清  面向农村轰轰烈烈
    本报定县17日电　本报记者舒倜、方辰报道：中共河北省定县县委抛弃了片面地追求建设产值大、利润高的轻工业的地方工业建设方针，采取了主要为农业技术改造和解放农村劳动力服务的方针以后，得到全县六十五万农民热烈的支持。定县已成为河北省发展县乡工业最有成绩的一个县。一个多月，全县就兴建起一千五百三十个中、小型工厂，平均每天有三十五个工厂投入生产。其中，中小型农业机械制造、修配厂、水力发电站、肥料厂、水泥厂、砖厂、粮食及饲料加工厂等直接服务于农业生产的工厂一千一百七十二个。一个以农业生产技术改造为中心的县乡工业网已初具规模。全县三十九个乡，四、五百个村庄，乡乡都有农业机械修配厂，村村都有了修配站和一个到二个颗粒肥料厂。现在的定县，已能做到农业机械小修不出村、中修不出乡、大修不出县。定县的县乡工业，在过去的四十多天中，已为当地农民制造出三十四种简易煤气机、小型拖拉机等农业耕作和排灌机械，修配了农具及机械十一万八千多件，根据估计，其中仅仅用作排灌的机械，在十二小时内就能浇地二十万零四千六百多亩，可以为农民腾出六万八千多个劳动力，从事深耕细作。定县发展县乡工业的初步成果，使农民充满了跃进的信心。
    在今年2月初，中共定县县委开始草拟工业发展规划的时候，只是在计算如何使原来仅占农副业产值32.8％的工业产值，在今年内就超过农业产值。根据当时的规划草案，准备以80％以上的资金，举办投资少、利润大的酿酒、制糖、罐头、牛奶、造纸等与农业生产无直接关系的工厂。如计划中规定今年在全县三十九个乡兴建三十九个酿酒厂，年产白酒一千四百三十多万斤（平均全县每人二十二斤）。这个规划还没有跟群众见面，他们就自己兴冲冲地行动起来：找一个留学生设计了一种鸡鸭场，平均一只只值两角钱的雏鸡，要建造价值十二元的设备，还特地为鸭子设计了一个游泳池。为了兴建一个拥有一百头乳牛的牛奶厂，派出干部去搜购奶牛。县里还从商业、工业、农业各部门中抽调了一百二十名干部分头去采购农业机器。他们好容易在辽宁、柳州、西安、洛阳等地订购了五百九十台锅驼机，可是当有些采购人员还没有回到定县，他们签订的订货单却早就退回了；因为这些机械在当地已经供不应求。
    就在这样筹办工业的两个月里，全县农业生产大跃进的形势，对县乡工业提出了迫切而具体的新要求。农民为了实现今年“保证八百斤、争取一千斤”的跃进规划，史无前例地开沟挖渠、深耕细作，向地夺水、与天争粮。由于全县一百四十四万多亩农田全部实现了水利化，需要的农业劳动力比过去增加一倍以上，畜力增加八倍左右，农民忙得“白天围着井台转（推水车），晚上围着磨台转（磨面、碾米）”，普遍地感到劳动力严重不足。有的农民向县里干部诉苦说：“吃了地多的亏”，有的社甚至要求让出几百亩、几千亩地给别的社种，可是没人要。农民迫切要求增添机器，解放劳动力，埋怨机耕农具太少、机器动力太少，埋怨机器坏了县里不能修理。同时，农民们需要肥料的心情，也很迫切，村村农民都反映：“每棵甘薯多用五个肥料蛋，就可增加产量五斤半。”
    中共定县县委会的领导干部在下乡参加农业劳动的过程中，对农民的迫切要求更加有了切身的体会。他们在社里跟男女社员一起，十来个人推着一辆大八卦水车，一天只浇上二、三亩田，因此，越来越感到原订的发展县乡工业的规划离开农业的实际太远了。正在这时，河北省召开了地方工业规划会议，讨论了中央和省委提出的地方工业方针，县委委员们的思想开朗了，明确了县乡工业必须主要为农业生产服务。回来后，县委会又分析了农业生产的情况，经过反复研究，确定本县工业发展的方针是，主要为农业的技术改造和解放农村劳动力服务，首先要抓小型农业机械制造和修配，随之而来的必须抓动力，抓肥料，抓建筑材料。于是重新以“四抓”为纲，修改工业发展规划，提出了争取在一年到四年内，全县实现“九化”、“四网”的奋斗目标。九化是：灌溉自流化、机械化、电气化，农产品加工机械化，肥料化学化，运输车辆胶轮化，耕作机械化，收割机械化，全县电气化，“四网”是：电话网，广播网，交通运输网，电话会议网。县的农业和工业跃进规划草案订出以后，县委便发动全党、全民进行讨论。
    以农业技术改造、解放农村劳动力为中心的发展县乡工业规划草案同群众一见面，立即得到了干部和农民的热烈支持，不少农业社的干部和社员在讨论的时候说：“大跃进以来，大家不分昼夜，干劲很大，但总感到人手不够，很费劲，经过讨论才知道，原来是少了一条腿（指缺工业），如果有了这条腿，就会走得更快。”很多农民兴高彩烈地说：“这真是推小车的拾了根搭包（束腰带），有绊（盼）了。”很快地兴办县乡工业的热潮迅速波及到每个村庄。生铁不够，全县农民就卖出了三百多万斤废铁。全县三十九个乡的农民，在不到一个月中，还自筹了四百二十八万多元的资金。一万多名有技术的“土把式”、转业军人、退休老工人和教员，积极地参加了县、乡、社的工业建设。叮咛店村的农民从定县的各机关和一些工厂里收集了“两筐破烂”——旧电线、旧机器等，经过工人们一昼夜的苦干，就建成了一个十瓩的水电站；当这个农民自己兴建的全县第一个水电站开始发电的时候，当地农民欣喜若狂，男女老幼奔走相告：“花了一百多元就建立了一个水电站，白天用电动水车浇田，晚上带小钢磨磨面”。外乡外社的车马云集叮咛店，争先参观。胡房店村的农民听到要在村里建一座水电站，就自动拿出六百多块银元和大批建筑材料；在建站过程中，发现砖头不足，全村农民立即展开投砖运动，一个下午就投砖八千块。水泥不够，农民们毅然地把三十多块祖坟石碑拿来代替水泥。
