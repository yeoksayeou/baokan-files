    "向" is the simplified character for "嚮"
    In the People's Daily third page letter column, the character "响" used in the small headline "Travel Guide" is incorrect. It should be the character "向". Because "响" is the simplified character for "響", and "向" is the simplified character for "嚮" in "嚮导" (guide).

    Editor's Note: Comrade Wen Guangsheng's criticism is correct. We have decided to correct it and will pay attention in future editing work to avoid making mistakes in the use of simplified characters again.

### “向”是“嚮”的简体字

    “向”是“嚮”的简体字
    人民日报第三版来信栏有一个小报头“旅行响导”所用的“响”字是误字。应当是“向”字。因为“响”是“響”的简体字，“向”才是“嚮导”的“嚮”的简体字呢。

    编者按：温广声同志的批评正确，我们决定改正，并在今后编辑工作中注意，不再发生错用简体字的错误。
