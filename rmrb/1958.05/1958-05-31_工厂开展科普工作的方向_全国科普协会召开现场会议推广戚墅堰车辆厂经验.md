Xinhua News Agency report:

The National Association for Science and Technology Popularization held an on-site meeting from the 26th to the 28th in the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Plant in Jiangsu, to summarize and promote the plant's experience in eliminating the mystification of science, facing production, and carrying out mass scientific and technological popularization activities, thereby promoting technological innovation.

In the first three months of this year, the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Repair Factory saw over 1,470 new records and advanced experiences, all of which were promoted in a short period. In carrying out popular science activities, the factory first strengthened ideological work. Among scientific and technical personnel, it adopted methods such as presenting facts, reasoning, and posting big-character posters to criticize the young master style in popular science work, eliminate ideas that blindly believe in book knowledge, scientists, and look down on the inventions and creations of the working masses. At the same time, it conducted extensive publicity among the working masses to eliminate the mystification of science and set off a wave of "everyone talking about science, everyone engaging in creation."

Secondly, the factory implemented the principle of popular science work serving production, combined mass scientific research with popularization work according to production needs. The specific methods were: popular science organizations helping workers with inventions and creations; summarizing and promoting advanced experiences; popularizing new technologies; popularizing basic science knowledge and natural science knowledge. This approach effectively improved the scientific and technological level of the employees. Now, approximately 1,500 production workers in the factory have learned to read metric working drawings and mastered basic technical knowledge such as metal materials and tolerance fits. In the past, so-called technical "secrets" are now grasped by everyone.

Thirdly, the factory implemented the mass line, organizing popular science teams that combined workers and technicians. While actively developing membership among scientific and technical personnel, they began to massively develop advanced workers and experienced veteran workers as members. At the same time, they determined the content and form of activities according to production and mass needs. The forging workshop held five or six technical demonstration performances every week. The topics were all from the working masses, and each performance was warmly welcomed by the workers. After the famous advanced producer Zhang Jinrong joined the Popular Science Association, he and technician Jiang Kunhong studied and promoted the two advanced experiences of "one mold multiple castings" and "stacked box casting," which greatly improved production efficiency, reduced labor, materials, equipment, and workspace, and solved the critical problem of labor shortage. The factory's popular science work has transformed from a cold and deserted state with only a few scientific and technical personnel participating to a booming mass movement that penetrated into work areas and work groups.

Fourthly, popularization methods adopted a "three-combination" approach—combining lectures and demonstrations, combining classroom and on-site learning, and combining scientific theory with workers' practical experience. The forms of popularization included lectures, discussions, science and technology bulletin boards, technical demonstration performances, etc. These three combinations solved fundamental issues such as linking theory with practice, improving and popularizing knowledge, and combining workers and technicians, thereby enriching the content of popular science work, opening up the work situation, stimulating the enthusiasm of popular science workers, and driving a great leap forward in popular science work.

Fifthly, the Party Committee took the lead, organized collaboration, and promoted progress together. In their popular science work, they adopted the method of unified leadership, unified planning, and coordinated operations by the Party Committee. The Party Committee and the administration included popular science work in the entire technological innovation movement plan. Various departments formulated specific plans according to their respective characteristics. The factory's trade union and the Communist Youth League mainly organized and mobilized employees to learn new technologies and advanced experiences. The popular science organization mainly focused on strengthening the popular science team and mobilizing members to widely carry out scientific and technological publicity activities.

During the on-site meeting, the representatives visited the factory's popular science publicity activities and workers' technological innovation operation performances, which were very inspiring. They unanimously believed that the experience of the Qishuyan Rolling Stock Repair Factory was the direction for factories to carry out popular science work. They linked the popular science work situation in their regions and criticized the shortcomings of being detached from production, detached from the masses, popularizing for the sake of popularizing, considering popular science to be the business of scientists, and simply pursuing large-scale lectures while neglecting the needs of the masses. The representatives unanimously expressed that they would bring back the experiences exchanged at this meeting, break superstitions under the leadership of the Party Committee, give full play to the noble style of daring to think and daring to act, and make a great march towards the technological revolution and cultural revolution.

Huang Zhe, Deputy Secretary-General of the National Association for Science and Technology Popularization, spoke at the meeting.

    工厂开展科普工作的方向
    全国科普协会召开现场会议推广戚墅堰车辆厂经验
    据新华社讯　中华全国科学技术普及协会26到28日在江苏戚墅堰机车车辆工厂召开现场会议，总结推广这个厂破除科学神秘化观念，面向生产，开展群众性科学技术普及活动，从而促进技术革新的经验。
    戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂在今年的三个月中共出现了一千四百七十多件新纪录和先进经验，并且在短期内全部得到推广。工厂在开展科普活动中，首先加强思想工作，在科学技术人员中采取摆事实、讲道理、贴大字报等方法，批判了在科普工作中的少爷作风，破除了迷信书本知识、迷信科学家、看不起工人群众创造发明等的思想；同时在工人群众中进行广泛宣传，破除科学神秘化的观念，掀起“人人讲科学、个个搞创造”的热潮。
    其次，贯彻了科普工作为生产服务的方针，根据生产需要，把群众性的科学研究同普及工作结合起来。具体做法是：科普组织帮助工人发明创造；总结推广先进经验；普及新技术；普及基础科学知识和自然科学知识。这种作法有效地提高了职工群众的科学技术水平。现在这个工厂约有一千五百多名生产工人学会了看公制工作图和掌握了金属材料、公差配合等基本技术知识。过去所谓技术上的“关子”、“秘密”，现在都被大家掌握。
    第三，贯彻群众路线，组织工人和技术人员相结合的科普队伍。他们在积极发展科技人员入会的同时，开始大量发展先进工人和具有一定经验的老工人入会。同时，根据生产和群众需要，确定活动的内容和形式。锻冶车间每星期举行五、六次技术示范表演，选题全部来自工人群众，每次表演都受工人们的热烈欢迎。著名先进生产者张金荣参加了科普协会后，同技术人员蒋坤洪等研究推广“一模多铸”、“叠箱浇铸”两项先进经验，生产效率大大提高，而且减少了人工、材料、设备和作业面积，解决了劳动力缺乏的关键问题。全厂的科普工作从少数科技人员参加的冷冷清清的状态，转变为深入到工区、工组的轰轰烈烈的群众性运动。
    第四，普及方法采取“三结合”——讲演和表演相结合，课堂和现场相结合，科学理论和工人实际经验相结合。普及的形式有演讲会、讨论会、科技板报、技术示范表演等。这三个结合解决了理论联系实际、提高和普及以及工人和技术人员结合等根本性问题，因而丰富了科普工作内容，打开了工作局面，激起科普工作者的积极性，带动了科普工作大跃进。
    第五，党委挂帅，组织协作，共同促进。他们在科普工作中，采取党委统一领导、统一规划、协同作战的办法。党委和行政把科普工作列入整个技术革新运动规划之内。各部门根据规划，按各自的特点作出具体规划。工厂的工会和共青团主要组织动员职工学习新技术和先进经验，科普组织主要抓壮大科普队伍，动员会员广泛开展科学技术宣传活动。
    在这次现场会议期间，代表们参观了厂内的科普宣传活动和工人的技术革新操作表演，得到很大启发，一致认为戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂的经验是工厂开展科普工作的方向。他们联系本地区科普工作情况，批判了脱离生产、脱离群众、为普及而普及、科普是科学家的事以及单纯追求大型演讲、忽视群众需要等的缺点。代表们一致表示要把这次会议上交流的经验带回去，在党委的领导下，破除迷信，充分发挥敢想敢作的高尚风格，向技术革命和文化革命大进军。
    中华全国科学技术普及协会副秘书长黄哲在会上讲了话。
