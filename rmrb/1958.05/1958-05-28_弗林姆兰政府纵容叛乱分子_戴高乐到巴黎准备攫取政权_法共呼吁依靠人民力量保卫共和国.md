Xinhua News Agency, May 27th dispatch from Paris: The French political situation is undergoing drastic changes. With the Pflimlin government making repeated concessions and seeking compromises with fascist forces, the arrogance of the fascist far-right group headed by De Gaulle is growing. The republican system is in serious danger. The French Communist Party is leading democratic forces in resolutely resisting the fascist threat.

De Gaulle, who arrived in Paris yesterday evening from his country villa, stated in a statement this noon that he had already begun the "necessary formal procedures" for organizing a government yesterday. This statement was also broadcast by the government radio station.

De Gaulle's declaration of seizing power was issued at a time when right-wing forces and so-called "centrist" parties in France are intensifying their political farce at the expense of the republican system. Since the colonialist fascist group in Algeria expanded the rebellion to Corsica, a province of mainland France, the right-wing forces in France have abandoned their previous covert activities and openly come forward to intensify pressure on the Pflimlin government, demanding that it make way for De Gaulle to come to power.

The Pflimlin government has been making every effort behind the scenes to conduct compromise secret talks with De Gaulle in recent days. It is reported that Pflimlin dispatched his "special envoy" to negotiate with De Gaulle on the afternoon of the 26th. That evening, De Gaulle arrived in Paris by car and held talks with "Independent Party" leader Pinay and Popular Republican Movement member Schuman. Schuman, with semi-official appointment, is acting as an intermediary between Pflimlin and De Gaulle. Sources say that De Gaulle also met with Gaillard and Pflimlin that evening.

On the other hand, the Pflimlin government has always adopted an attitude of connivance towards the fascist rebels. At the emergency meeting of the National Assembly on the evening of the 26th, Pflimlin continued to show tolerance towards the fascist rioters and colonial military generals who participated in the Algerian riots, and exonerated them from their crimes.

French Communist Party parliamentary group chairman Duclos condemned the Pflimlin government for conniving with fascist forces and conducting secret talks with De Gaulle in his speech.

Prior to this, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement on the 26th regarding the serious situation caused by the Corsican fascist riots, stating that for twelve days, the government has been retreating in the face of the rebellion, allowing fascists to carry out their evil activities more rampantly.

The statement also criticized the positions of the leaders of the Socialist Party, Radical Socialist Party, and Popular Republican Movement. They established the National Action and Defense of the Republic Action Committee of the Parliament, but did not allow the Communist Party to participate, which made the committee isolated and unable to obtain the support of the working class. The Political Bureau called for an immediate change of wavering attitude, to combat the conspirators, punish the rebel leaders who opposed the republic, and resolutely rely on the strength of the entire people to defend the republic.

    弗林姆兰政府纵容叛乱分子　戴高乐到巴黎准备攫取政权
    法共呼吁依靠人民力量保卫共和国
    据新华社27日讯　巴黎消息：法国政局正在发生急剧变化。在弗林姆兰政府向法西斯势力节节退让和谋求妥协的情况下，以戴高乐为首的法西斯极右翼集团的气焰越来越嚣张。共和制度处在严重的危险中。法国共产党正在领导民主力量坚决抗击法西斯的威胁。
    昨天晚上乘车由乡间别墅来到巴黎的戴高乐在今天中午发表声明说，他已经在昨天开始了组织政府的“必要的正规程序”。这个声明并且由政府电台加以广播。
    戴高乐的这个宣告正在攫取政权的声明是在法国右翼势力和所谓“中间派”政党以共和制度为代价加紧串演政治丑剧的时候发表的。自从阿尔及利亚的殖民主义法西斯集团把叛乱扩大到作为法国本土一个省的科西嘉岛之后，法国右翼势力丢开以往暗中活动的手法，而公开出面，加紧对弗林姆兰政府施加压力，要它为戴高乐上台让路。
    弗林姆兰政府连日来竭力在幕后同戴高乐进行妥协性的密谈。据报道，弗林姆兰26日下午派遣他的“特使”同戴高乐商谈。当天傍晚，戴高乐乘车到了巴黎，同“独立党”头子比内和人民共和党议员舒曼举行了会谈。舒曼是得到半官方的任命，充当弗林姆兰和戴高乐之间的中间人的。有消息说，戴高乐当天晚上还会见了戈蒂和弗林姆兰。
    另一方面，弗林姆兰政府对法西斯叛乱分子始终采取纵容的态度。在26日晚间举行的国民议会紧急会议上，弗林姆兰继续对参加阿尔及利亚暴乱的法西斯暴乱分子和殖民军将领表示忍让，为他们开脱罪责。
    法国共产党议会党团主席杜克洛在发言中谴责弗林姆兰政府纵容法西斯势力，并且同戴高乐进行幕后会谈。
    在这以前，法国共产党中央委员会政治局26日曾就科西嘉岛法西斯暴乱事件所引起的严重局势发表声明说：十二天以来，政府一直在叛乱面前退却，使法西斯分子能够更猖狂地进行罪恶活动。
    声明也批评了社会党、激进社会党和人民共和党领导人的立场。他们成立了议会的民族行动和保卫共和国行动委员会，却不让共产党参加，这就使得这个委员会自陷于孤立，得不到工人阶级的支持。政治局呼吁立即改变动摇态度，打击阴谋分子，惩办反对共和国的叛乱祸首，坚决依靠全体人民的力量来保卫共和国。
