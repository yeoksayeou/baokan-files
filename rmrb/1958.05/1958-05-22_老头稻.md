　　　　**Old Man Rice**
　　　　By Our Correspondent Ma Xinren

    Among the dozens of improved varieties promoted for planting in Heilongjiang Province, there is a type of rice called "Old Man Rice."

    The improved variety of "Old Man Rice" was bred by Quan Taiguan, an old farmer from the Xingguang Agricultural Cooperative in Acheng County. Twelve years ago, he planted 45 mu of rice in Bin County. The early autumn frost caused most of the rice to suffer from frost damage. With a heavy heart, Quan Taiguan observed the frost-stricken rice fields and discovered that three ears of rice were growing very strongly. Not only had they not lodged, but they had also matured very well, with large ears and many grains. He gently pulled up the rice plants and found that these three plants had many differences from the original variety. One ear had 185 grains, one had 135 grains, and one had 130 grains. He threshed the ears separately and carefully stored them. The following year, he moved to Acheng County and planted those rice grains near the water source. As a result, some of them were washed away by the water, and he only harvested a dozen single ears in the autumn.

    In 1948, he selected two square meters of fertile soil with easy irrigation and drainage, planted this variety, and meticulously cultivated and managed it. He also discovered that this variety had two types: early-maturing and late-maturing. After the autumn of that year, he selected three jin of seeds from each of the two types. In the spring of 1949, he planted and cultivated them separately on 30 square meters of land. Based on field observations that year, the late-maturing type was better than the early-maturing type, so he selected the late-maturing variety to continue breeding.

    In the beginning, because he was not familiar with the characteristics of this variety, he encountered many difficulties. Some farmers even advised him: "It's a waste of effort, you're so old, why not take a break!" But Quan Taiguan was not discouraged and wholeheartedly wanted to cultivate this variety.

    In 1951, the variety cultivated by Quan Taiguan began to be promoted in Acheng County. By 1957, 135,000 mu in eight counties throughout the province had been planted with this variety. This variety has uniform heading and consistent maturity, maturing two to four days earlier than ordinary varieties, with a 10% to 15% increase in yield, good rice quality, and a 3% higher rice yield than ordinary rice. This variety is very popular among the masses. Because it was the elderly farmer Quan Taiguan who cultivated this variety, the masses affectionately call this variety "Old Man Rice."

    老头稻
　　　　本报记者　马新仁
    在黑龙江省推广种植的几十种优良品种中，有一种水稻叫“老头稻”。
    选育出“老头稻”良种的是阿城县星光农业社的老农民权太观。十二年前他在宾县种了四十五亩水稻，秋霜来的早，绝大部分受了霜灾。心情沉重的权太观在受灾的稻田里观察，发现有三穗稻子长的很健壮，不但没有倒伏，而且成熟的很好，穗大粒多。他轻轻地把水稻拔下来，发现这三棵稻子和原来的品种有很多不同的地方。三个穗一个有一百八十五粒，一个一百三十五粒，一个一百三十粒。他把穗子分别脱粒，精心保管起来。第二年他搬家到阿城县，把那些稻子种在近水的地方，结果被水冲走了一些，秋天只收了十几个单穗。
    1948年他选了两平方公尺土质肥沃、灌排水容易的地，把这个品种种下，精心细致地培育管理。他又发现这个品种有两种类型，一种早熟，一种晚熟。这年秋后，他从两个类型中各选出三斤种子，1949年春天，在三十平方公尺的土地上分别种植培育。这一年根据实地观察，晚熟的类型比过早成熟的好，于是他就选了晚熟的品种继续繁殖。
    开始因他不熟悉这个品种的习性，遇到不少困难，还有农民劝告他：“白费劲，那么大岁数了，歇一会多好！”可是权太观并不灰心，一心一意要把这个品种培育起来。
    1951年权太观培育的品种在阿城县开始推广，到1957年全省已有八个县十三万五千亩种上了这个品种。这个品种出穗整齐、成熟一致，比一般品种早熟两天到四天，增产10％到15％，米质好，出米率也比一般稻子高3％。这个品种很受群众欢迎，因为培育这个品种的是老年农民权太观，群众亲切地叫这个品种“老头稻”。
