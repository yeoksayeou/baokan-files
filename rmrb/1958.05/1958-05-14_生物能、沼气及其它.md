　　Bioenergy, Biogas and More
　　What is Bioenergy? Bioenergy refers to the heat energy generated by burning a gas produced through the fermentation and decomposition of organic matter by microorganisms. This heat energy can be converted into mechanical energy and electrical energy. Bioenergy is one of the three major energies in nature: atomic energy, physicochemical energy, and bioenergy.
　　In the vast cities and countryside of our country, there are many discarded materials, such as human and animal manure, weeds, fallen leaves, lake weeds, sewage, sludge, as well as garbage, kitchen waste, and substances discharged from slaughtering and leather factories, which can all be used as raw materials for fermentation. These materials are almost inexhaustible. Therefore, it can be said that the resources of bioenergy are very abundant.
　　Biogas In various waste materials, except for some inorganic substances in sewage and sludge, the rest are pure organic substances. These organic substances contain different components and amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Putting these waste materials in a closed fermentation tank, maintaining appropriate temperature and acidity, and fermenting them through the action of microorganisms, will produce a gas called methane gas, commonly known as biogas. This gas contains a large amount of methane and carbon dioxide, as well as small amounts of other gases. Biogas is a colorless, odorless, slightly garlic-smelling combustible gas. When it is burned in combination with air, it can emit a large amount of heat energy. Under normal circumstances, its calorific value is 5,000 to 6,500 kilocalories per cubic meter.
　　Uses of Biogas The uses of biogas are truly limitless. It can not only be directly used for lighting, boiling water, and cooking, and is an ideal fuel without smoke, ash, or slag, and with freely adjustable heat, with 1,000 cubic meters of biogas being equivalent to 800 kilograms of coal. It can also power machines, serving as a power source. Using it to drive generators can increase the number of lights three times compared to direct gas lighting. It can also be compressed and stored in steel bottles for cars and tractors to replace gasoline or other fuel oil. According to reliable data, 1.5 cubic meters of biogas is equivalent to one kilogram of gasoline. Its uses are not limited to this. After processing, it can also yield many different chemical products.
　　Fermentation Tank This is the equipment in which many waste materials are placed for sealed fermentation. Fermentation tanks are brick, wood, and partially reinforced concrete structures similar in shape to underground cesspools. Their construction requires airtightness and the ability to maintain a certain temperature. According to existing material calculations, an eight-cubic-meter fermentation tank requires an investment of about 470 yuan, and can produce 540 cubic meters of biogas per year. Deducting 10% for loss, 486 cubic meters of biogas can be obtained, equivalent to 324 kilograms of gasoline, worth about 300 yuan. In this way, the entire investment can be recovered in just over a year.
　　Can the fertilizer after fermentation still be used? The fertilizer after fermentation can not only continue to be used, but its fertilizer effect is greatly improved. It is estimated that it can generally be increased fivefold. The reason for this is easy to understand. During fermentation, the protein in the fertilizer is broken down into ammonia. In ordinary compost, ammonia easily escapes because it is exposed to the air; while during sealed fermentation, the ammonia not only cannot escape, but the pressure inside the sealed tank causes the ammonia to dissolve in the water, thus stabilizing it. Therefore, the fertilizer effect is higher than that of ordinary compost.

　　生物能、沼气及其它
    生物能什么是生物能？利用微生物使有机质醱酵分解，产生一种气体，这种气体燃烧以后产生的热能，就叫生物能。这种热能可以转化为机械能、电能。生物能是自然界原子能、物理化学能、生物能三大能量之一。
    在我国广大城市和乡村中，有许多废弃物质，如人畜的粪便、杂草、落叶、湖草、污水、污泥等，还有城市里的垃圾、厨房里的废物、屠宰、皮革等工厂所排泄出来的物质，都可以用来作醱酵的原料。这些物质几乎是取之不尽用之不竭的。因此，可以说生物能的资源是很丰富的。
    沼气　在各种废弃物质中，除了污水、污泥中会有部分无机物质外，其余都是纯有机物质。在这些有机物质中含有不同成分和数量的蛋白质、碳水化合物和脂肪。把这些废弃的物质放在密闭的醱酵池内，保持适当的温度和酸碱度，进行醱酵，经过微生物的作用，就产生了一种气体，这种气体叫甲烷气体，通常又叫沼气。这种气体里面含有大量的甲烷和二氧化碳，还有少量的其他气体。沼气是一种无色无味、微有蒜臭的可燃气体，它同空气配合起来燃烧，可以发出大量的热能。在通常的情况下，它的发热值是每一立方公尺发生五千至六千五百千卡的热量。
    沼气的用途　谈起沼气的用途，真是前途无限。它不仅可以直接用于点灯、烧水、煮饭，是一种很理想的燃料，又没烟灰、没炉渣、火候可以自由调节，一千立方公尺的沼气相当于八百公斤的煤炭。而且它还可以发动机器，作为机器的动力。用它带动发电机，比气体直接点灯数量可以增加三倍。还可以把它经过压缩以后，装在钢制的瓶子里，可以供汽车、拖拉机代替汽油或其他燃料油用。据可靠资料计算，一点五立方公尺的沼气，就相当于一公斤的汽油。它的用途不仅于此。而且经过处理以后，还可以得到许许多多种的化学产品。
    醱酵池　就是把许多废弃物质放在里面密闭醱酵的设备。醱酵池是用砖、木、部分钢筋混凝土建造的形状类似地下粪坑的建筑。它的建造要求不漏气，能够保持一定的温度。据现有材料计算，一个八立方公尺的醱酵池，约需投资四百七十多元，全年可生产五百四十立方公尺的沼气。除去10％的损耗，可得四百八十六立方公尺的沼气，等于三百二十四公斤汽油，约合三百元。这样看来，一年多的时间就可以收回全部投资。
    醱酵以后的肥料还能不能用？　醱酵后的肥料不仅可以继续使用，而且肥效大大提高了。据推测，一般可提高五倍。这个道理是容易明白的。肥料在醱酵的时候，其中蛋白质被分解为氨。通常的堆肥，由于暴露在空气中，氨很容易跑掉；而密闭醱酵时，氨不仅跑不了，而且密闭池内的压力使氨溶在水内，这样就稳定了。因此肥效也就比一般堆肥要高。
