Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 5th. Millions of agricultural cooperative members in Zhejiang Province are busy transplanting rice seedlings every day. They report: Rice transplanting used to be the same old routine, but this year there are many new developments.

	The sight of people transplanting rice seedlings from boats can be seen everywhere in the Hangjiahu area and the coastal plains of eastern Zhejiang. Tens of thousands of rice transplanting boats float in the fields like ducks, with male and female cooperative members sitting at the bow transplanting rice seedlings with ease and joy. Many women also bring their children along in the rice transplanting boats, so they can transplant rice seedlings and take care of their children at the same time. Bending over to transplant rice seedlings under the hot sun used to be the most arduous task, but now it has become a light and pleasant farm job. Jin Xiaohua, a 68-year-old female cooperative member from Song'ao Township, Fenghua County, sat in a rice transplanting boat and transplanted more than 2,000 seedlings in three consecutive hours. She said she didn't feel any back pain or stiffness in her feet. With the popularization of rice transplanting boats, rice transplanting buckets, rice transplanting stools, and rice transplanting sleds for sitting and transplanting have also appeared one after another.

	In Jiaxing, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jinhua and other areas, cooperative members also commonly use rice transplanting rulers, rice transplanting frames, rice transplanting ropes, or rice transplanting baskets. Rice transplanting lamps are lit at the edge of the fields when transplanting at night. These new tools are all used to ensure that rice seedlings are transplanted densely, early, quickly, and well.

	More than one million trained rice transplanting experts throughout the province have led the vast number of cooperative members in skillfully using these new tools. At present, more than 90% of the three million mu of early rice that has already been transplanted meet the standards of advanced operating procedures such as dense planting, and the transplanting time is generally about ten days earlier than last year.

	This year, Huangyan, Pingyang, Ruian, Qingtian and other counties have also focused on using rice transplanting machines for transplanting. Farmers report that rice transplanting machines transplant both quickly and well.

	The widespread participation of women in learning and engaging in rice transplanting is also a characteristic of this year. In many areas, women account for more than 30% of the rice transplanting force. Many women are conducting rice transplanting competitions with their husbands. Due to the participation of large numbers of women in rice transplanting, many agricultural cooperatives have solved the problem of labor shortages.

    今年插秧新事多
    浙江农村使用插秧船、插秧机
    新华社杭州5日电　浙江省每天有几百万农业社社员在忙着插秧。他们反映：往年插秧老一套，今年插秧新事多。
    坐船插秧在杭嘉湖地区和浙东沿海平原地区到处可以看到。几万只插秧船像鸭子一样在田野里浮动着，坐在船头的男女社员轻松愉快地插秧。许多妇女把小孩子也带在插秧船里，既可以插秧又可以照顾孩子。在炎日下弯腰插秧本来最辛苦，现在变成轻便愉快的农活了。奉化县松岙乡六十八岁的女社员金小花，坐在插秧船里连续插秧三个小时，插下了两千多丛，她说一点也不觉得腰酸背痛，脚也不硬。随着插秧船的推广，用来坐着插秧的插秧桶、插秧凳和插秧滑板也相继出现了。
    在嘉兴、宁波、温州、金华等专区，社员还普遍使用插秧尺、插秧架、插秧绳或者插秧篮。晚上插秧时田头点起插秧灯。这些新工具都是用来保证秧苗插密、插早、插快、插好的。
    全省经过训练的一百多万插秧手，带动了广大社员在熟练地使用这些新工具。目前，已经插好的三百万亩早稻，90％以上都符合密植等先进操作规程标准，插秧时间一般比去年提早十天左右。
    今年黄岩、平阳、瑞安、青田等县还重点使用插秧机插秧。农民反映：用插秧机插得又快又好。
    到处是妇女学习插秧、参加插秧，也是今年的特点。许多地区的插秧手中，妇女占30％以上。许多妇女和自己的丈夫开展插秧竞赛。由于大批妇女参加插秧，许多农业社解决了劳动力紧张的问题。
