Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 4th: The secretary of the Indian National Congress announced to the press on the evening of the 3rd that at the closed meeting of the Congress Parliamentary Party held that evening, Nehru had decided to withdraw his previously submitted request to temporarily resign from the post of Prime Minister.

According to the announcement, the Congress Parliamentary Party believed that Prime Minister Nehru should not resign, but if he wished, he could take a short vacation. Prime Minister Nehru stated at the meeting that he would abide by the decision of the Congress Party.

For several days, Indian newspapers have continuously published news about Prime Minister Nehru's request to temporarily resign. According to reports, shortly after Nehru returned to Delhi from inspecting Kerala on April 29, he expressed to President Prasad that he wanted a period of time away from government duties. According to the Press Trust of India, Nehru said at the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting on May 1 that he did not need a vacation and that his health was as normal. What he needed was a "peaceful state of mind," so that he could personally consider what was wrong with him and what was wrong with the country, the party, or the organization. At the same meeting, he also said that currently, not only within the Indian National Congress, but also in Indian public life, "things are not going smoothly." Prime Minister Nehru explained the reasons for his request to temporarily resign once again on May 3. He said that he did so because he felt that in Indian public life, the atmosphere was becoming darker and heavier, making it difficult for sensitive people to breathe easily.

    尼赫鲁总理收回辞职要求
    据新华社新德里4日电　印度国大党书记在3日晚间对报界宣布，在这一天晚间举行的国大党国会党团的秘密会议上，尼赫鲁已经决定收回他曾经提出的暂时辞去总理职务的要求。
    据宣布，国大党国会党团会议认为尼赫鲁总理不应当辞职，但是如果他愿意，他可以得到短期的休假。尼赫鲁总理在会上表示服从国大党的决定。
    几天以来，印度报纸连续发表了有关尼赫鲁总理要求暂时辞职的消息。据报道，尼赫鲁总理在4月29日从喀拉拉邦视察完毕回到德里以后不久，曾经同普拉沙德总统表示他想有一个时期摆脱政府的职责。据印度报业托辣斯报道，尼赫鲁在5月1日举行的国大党国会党团会议上说，他并不需要休假，他的身体健康如常，他需要的是一种“平静的心境”，这样，他能够切身考虑一下他有什么毛病、国家、党或者组织有什么毛病。他在同一次会上还说，目前不仅在印度国大党内，而且在印度的公共生活中，“事情都不顺当”。尼赫鲁总理在5月3日又一次说明他要求暂时辞职的原因。他说，他这样做是因为感觉到在印度的公共生活中，气氛在变得更加阴暗、沉重，这使得敏感的人很难轻松地呼吸。
