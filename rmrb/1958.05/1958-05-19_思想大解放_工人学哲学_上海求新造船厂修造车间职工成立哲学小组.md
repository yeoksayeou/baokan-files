　　Great Ideological Emancipation: Workers Study Philosophy
    Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard Repair and Construction Workshop Employees Establish Philosophy Group

    (Reported by Shanghai Jiefang Daily) On the evening of the 9th, a group of employees were carefully reading Chairman Mao's brilliant work, "On Contradiction," in a workshop office at the Shanghai Qiuxin Shipyard. This was a philosophy group spontaneously organized by the employees of the shipyard's repair and construction workshop.

    This study group was established after the anti-Rightist struggle. During the anti-Rightist struggle, a Rightist element in the repair and construction workshop abused philosophical terms to attack the Party's policies. At that time, the workers, in order to fight against the Rightist elements, developed a desire to study philosophy. In mid-March, they spontaneously organized a philosophy group and elected the workshop's Party branch secretary as the group leader. Among the twelve people participating in the study were workers, staff members, apprentices, and even the workshop director. They concentrated their studies during the factory's cultural learning time on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday evenings.

    At the beginning, they studied the first chapter of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" - "Two Types of Contradictions with Different Natures." While studying this chapter, they not only clarified the different natures and different handling methods of the two types of social contradictions in theory, but also展开 practical discussions. For example, in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in production, the supply of raw materials could not keep up with the needs of production, and some workers complained: How can we have a Great Leap Forward if we lack raw materials? The philosophy group immediately discussed: What is the main contradiction in our workshop? How to solve it? When everyone realized that the lag in the supply of raw materials was an inevitable contradiction in the great development of production, they took the initiative to save raw materials.

    The members of this study group generally have a junior high school education level, and some were illiterate or semi-illiterate at the beginning of liberation. For more than two months, they have adopted the form of mutual teaching and learning, and combined it with attending lectures on socialist education courses in the factory, conducting discussions, and always persisting in learning. Especially when they are able to use the little theory they have learned to solve practical problems, their interest in studying philosophy is even stronger. Now, this group has decided to study Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" and "On Practice" this year, and also to study "Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship."

　　思想大解放  工人学哲学
    上海求新造船厂修造车间职工成立哲学小组
    本报讯　据上海解放日报报道：9日晚，在上海求新造船厂一个车间办公室里，一群职工在精心地阅读毛主席的光辉著作——“矛盾论”，这是这个厂的修造车间职工自动组织起来的一个哲学小组。
    这个学习小组是在反右派斗争以后成立的。在反右派斗争期间，修造车间有个右派分子滥用哲学上的名词术语攻击党的政策，当时职工们为了和右派分子斗争，引起学习哲学的愿望。3月中旬，就自动组织了一个哲学小组，推选车间党支部书记做小组长。参加学习的十二个人中，有工人、职员、学徒，还有车间主任。每周一三五晚上，利用厂里文化学习时间集中学习。
    一开始，他们就学习了毛主席的“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”第一章——“两类不同性质的矛盾”，在学习这一章时，他们不但从理论上搞清了两类社会矛盾的不同性质和不同处理方法，并且联系实际问题展开讨论。如在生产大跃进的高潮中，原材料的供应跟不上生产的需要，有些工人就有怨言：又要大跃进，又缺乏原材料，要我们怎样大跃进？哲学小组马上讨论：我们车间的主要矛盾是什么？怎样解决？当大家明确了原材料供应跟不上，是生产大发展中不可避免的矛盾，就主动节约原材料。
    这个学习小组的成员一般是初中文化程度，有些人在解放初还是文盲或半文盲。两个多月来，他们采取互教互学的形式，并结合旁听厂内的社会主义教育课程讲座，进行讨论，始终坚持学习。特别当他们能运用所学的一点理论，解决实际问题的时候，学习哲学的兴趣更浓。现在，这个小组决定，今年内要学习毛主席的“矛盾论”和“实践论”，还要学习“无产阶级专政的历史经验”。
