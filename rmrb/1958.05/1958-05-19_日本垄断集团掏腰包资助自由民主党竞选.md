Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo: As the date of the Japanese general election approaches, the "Economic Reconstruction Roundtable," an organization through which the Japanese financial and business community provides funds to political parties, is vigorously raising election funds for the Liberal Democratic Party. This organization recently announced plans to raise 800 million yen for this election. According to Kyodo News, the majority of these political funds will be given to the Liberal Democratic Party.

The Liberal Democratic Party not only receives strong support from Japanese monopoly capital groups during elections, but also receives substantial financial support from them at other times. According to a "Asahi Shimbun" report, out of the Liberal Democratic Party's total financial revenue of 553 million yen last year, more than 480 million yen was donated by monopoly capital groups, accounting for 87.6% of total income. The "Economic Reconstruction Roundtable" alone gave 276.5 million yen to the Liberal Democratic Party last year. Maruzen Oil Company, Toyota Motor Industries, Isuzu Motors, and others each gave 10 million to 15 million yen, while Tokyo Gas Company, Fuji Iron & Steel Company, Yawata Iron & Steel Company, and others each gave 5 million to 7 million yen.

　　日本垄断集团掏腰包
    资助自由民主党竞选
    据新华社讯　东京消息：随着日本大选日期的迫近，日本金融界和实业界向政党提供资金的机构“经济再建恳谈会”正在大力为自由民主党募集大选资金。这个机构最近已经发表了要为这次大选募集八亿日元的计划。据共同社说，这项政治资金大部分将送给自由民主党。
    自由民主党不但在大选中受到日本垄断资本集团的大力支援，就是在平时也受它们的大力资助。据“朝日新闻”报道，自由民主党在去年财政收入总额五亿五千三百多万日元中，有四亿八千多万日元是垄断资本集团赠送的，占全部收入的87.6％。“经济再建恳谈会”去年就送了二亿七千六百五十万日元给自由民主党，丸善石油公司、丰田汽车工业公司、五十铃汽车公司等都送了一千万到一千五百万日元，东京瓦斯公司、富士制铁公司、八幡制铁公司等都送了五百万到七百万日元。
