Tianjin Commercial Departments
Try Every Possible Means to Promote Production

(Our dispatch) Tianjin commercial departments are actively promoting industrial production and strengthening cooperation between industry and commerce.

The Tianjin First Commercial Bureau system has achieved initial results in assisting industry to improve product quality and increase the variety of designs and colors. According to incomplete statistics from units under the First Commercial Bureau, by the end of March, they had assisted industrial departments in collecting 3,059 kinds of advanced samples from home and abroad, 632 copies of drawings, pictures, and technical data; 362 pieces of feedback on product quality; and organized 46 industrial-commercial exchange meetings, factory observation visits, quality and price comparisons, and sample exhibitions; in addition, they held 82 forums for grassroots salespersons, resident representatives, and consumers to widely solicit their opinions on Tianjin products and provide them to industrial departments for research.

With the active efforts of industrial departments and close cooperation between industry and commerce, the quality of 419 products has been improved, and 58 of them have reached or surpassed advanced levels at home and abroad. For example, employees of the hardware purchasing station tried every possible means to help industrial departments solve the problem of high-quality coiled rod raw materials, and actively collected advanced foreign samples for industrial departments to study. With the efforts of the workers, the quality of welding rods surpassed Shanghai and caught up with the levels of American "Lincoln" brand and Swedish "OK" brand. Based on consumer feedback that the enamel basins had outdated patterns, dull luster, unbright colors, and low adhesion rates, the Tianjin Department Store Purchasing Station actively assisted industry in collecting a large number of advanced samples, and successively held quality and price comparison exhibitions, promoting industrial departments to improve their operations, so that the products surpassed Xi'an in terms of quality and variety of designs and colors. Employees of the electrical appliance purchasing station not only assisted industrial departments in improving the quality of many products such as pull-wire switches, plastic wires, and lightning rods, but also actively assisted industrial departments in improving product materials and reducing costs. Other units have similar situations.

By the end of March, Tianjin commodity departments had increased and expanded the variety of designs and colors by 1,311 kinds, most of which were commodities needed by rural areas. Farmers need a large number of lighting mast lamps for day and night river dredging and canal digging. Employees of the Trust Company actively assisted the mirror factory in working hard to develop a simple mast lamp, which was cheap and practical. After learning that Henan produced air battery lamps that were safe and convenient for the majority of rural users, the Department Store Purchasing Station actively supplied samples to the factory. After the workers' active research, they succeeded in trial production in only seven days and will soon be available in large quantities. They also produced a variety of new products for rural areas, such as economic face basins costing one to two yuan, and economic soaps costing 18 to 20 cents, which are very popular among farmers.

    天津商业部门
    千方百计促进生产
    本报讯　天津商业部门积极促进工业生产，加强了工商协作关系。
    天津市第一商业局系统在协助工业提高产品质量、增加花色品种方面，已得到初步效果。根据第一商业局所属各单位不完全统计，到3月底为止，共协助工业部门收集了国内外先进样品三千零五十九种，图纸、图片和技术资料六百三十二份；对商品质量的意见有三百六十二条；并组织工商部门碰头、厂际观摩、比质比价、样品展览会等四十六次；此外还召开了基层业务员、驻津代表和消费者座谈会八十二次，广泛地征求了他们对天津产品的意见，提供工业部门研究。
    在工业部门积极努力和工商密切配合下，已有四百十九种产品提高了质量，其中有五十八种已分别赶上或超过国内外先进水平。如五金采购站职工，千方百计协助工业部门解决了优质盘条的原料，并积极搜集了国外先进样品供给工业部门研究，在工人的努力下，使电焊条的质量超过了上海，赶上了美国“林肯”牌和瑞典“OK”牌水平。天津百货采购站根据消费者反映搪瓷面盆花样陈旧、光泽不亮、色艳不鲜、密着率不高等缺点，积极协助工业搜集了大量先进样品，先后召开了比质比价展览会，促进工业部门改进了操作，使产品在质量、花色等方面超过了西安。交电采购站职工不仅协助工业部门提高了拉线电门、塑胶线、避雷针等许多产品的质量，还积极协助工业部门改进了产品用料，降低了成本。其他各单位也有类似情况。
    到3月底为止，天津商品部门已增加和扩大花色品种一千三百十一种，其中大部分都是农村需要的商品。农民昼夜开河挖渠，需要大量照明桅灯，信托公司职工积极协助镜子工厂刻苦钻研，试制成功简易桅灯，价格便宜，并且实用。百货采购站了解到河南生产了适合广大农村使用的既安全又方便的空气电池灯后，就积极供给工厂样品，经工人积极钻研，仅七天就试制成功，近期即可大量供应。还为农村生产了一元至二元的经济脸盆，一角八分至两角的经济香皂等多种新品种，很受农民欢迎。
