Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 29th. After two years of hard struggle, Yujiang County, Jiangxi Province, has fundamentally eliminated schistosomiasis. This was announced by the leading body of schistosomiasis prevention and control work in Jiangxi Province at the recent celebration meeting for the eradication of schistosomiasis in Yujiang County. Professor Sun Zhenzhong, a member of the National Schistosomiasis Research Committee, said at the meeting that Yujiang County is the first county in the country to fundamentally eliminate schistosomiasis.

Fang Zhichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Governor, extended congratulations to the people of Yujiang County on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee. He said that Yujiang County's eradication of schistosomiasis is a major victory won by the people in their struggle against disease, and it also shows that eliminating this disease is not mysterious. He called on medical workers throughout the province to break free from the shackles of old ideas, eliminate superstition, rely on the masses to accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis, and quickly liberate a large number of the production army from the clutches of disease.

The review team, organized by the five-person leading group for the prevention and control of schistosomiasis of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and including schistosomiasis prevention and control technical personnel from twenty-three counties and cities throughout the province, made a report on the review of the eradication of schistosomiasis in Yujiang County at the celebration meeting. The report stated that in mid-May of this year, the review team conducted large-scale on-site snail surveys, universal stool examinations for patients, and effectiveness tests for stool and drinking water management in Maquan, Magang, Gongtang, Nigui and other four townships, one town, and two farms in Yujiang County where schistosomiasis was prevalent. As a result, no snails were found in these areas; the treatment rate from the universal stool examination of 472 people was 95.5%; private toilets have now been abolished in all epidemic areas, and small public toilets have been established and renovated, with dedicated personnel responsible for the management of each toilet; and public water wells have been established, each well having a public dipper, and in areas without water wells, river sections and ponds have been designated for drinking and water use, fully ensuring the safety of the masses' production and life. The report stated that the review results proved that Yujiang County had completely met the standards for the fundamental elimination of schistosomiasis set by the central schistosomiasis prevention and control work department in terms of eliminating snails, treating schistosomiasis, and managing feces and water.

Li Junjiu, First Secretary of the Yujiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, introduced the situation and experience of Yujiang County in eliminating schistosomiasis to more than one hundred schistosomiasis prevention and control cadres attending the meeting from the province. Li Junjiu said that before liberation, due to the severe prevalence of schistosomiasis in Yujiang County, many villages were depopulated and houses collapsed, fields were barren, and the level of production was extremely low. For example, in Magang Township, six villages were completely destroyed by schistosomiasis in the past thirty years. After the publication of the draft National Agricultural Development Program in January 1956, the Yujiang County Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the provisions of the draft program for the elimination of schistosomiasis and the specific local conditions, boldly formulated a plan to eliminate schistosomiasis in two years of hard work, and the First Secretary of the County Party Committee served as the head of the five-person leading group for schistosomiasis prevention and control. Subsequently, schistosomiasis prevention and control leading organizations were established in each district, township, and commune to quickly carry out this work. Li Junjiu said that in order not to affect production, Yujiang County closely integrated the elimination of schistosomiasis with production, and the County Party Committee put forward the principle of "taking production as the center and schistosomiasis prevention and control as the focus," specifically requiring the elimination of snails, fecal management, and water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation to be combined, and the treatment of patients to be combined with agricultural arrangements. During the two years of winter and spring water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation, the County Party Committee mobilized and led farmers to combine "opening new ditches and filling old ditches" to bury snails in the soil. As a result, during the construction of water conservancy projects, all 370 winding, weed-infested old ditches in the county were filled with soil, and new ditches were opened, so that the snails had nowhere to hide. The treatment of schistosomiasis patients was jointly arranged by the prevention and control station, the district, the township, and the commune. During the slack season, the main labor force was treated, and during the busy season, children, women, students, and fishermen were treated. Therefore, it not only did not affect production but also made full use of the beds, so that more than 4,000 patients in the county were treated separately. Li Junjiu said that after the elimination of schistosomiasis, a vigorous new atmosphere has emerged in Yujiang County in all aspects of production, life, and reproduction.

### 生产大军从病魔手里解放出来  余江县根本消灭血吸虫病

    生产大军从病魔手里解放出来
    余江县根本消灭血吸虫病
    新华社南昌29日电　经过两年苦战，江西余江县根本消灭了血吸虫病。这是江西省防治血吸虫病工作的领导机关在最近召开的余江县根除血吸虫病庆功大会上宣布的。全国血吸虫病研究委员会委员孙振中教授在会上说，余江县是全国根本消灭了血吸虫病的首创县。
    中共江西省委书记、副省长方志纯代表省委和省人委向余江县人民表示祝贺。他说，余江县根除了血吸虫病是人民同疾病作斗争所取得的一个重大胜利，同时也表明消灭这种疾病并不神秘。他要求全省医务工作者冲出旧思想的樊笼，破除迷信，依靠群众加速消灭血吸虫病，把大批生产大军迅速从病魔手里解放出来。
    由中共江西省委防治血吸虫病五人小组组织的、包括有全省二十三个县、市血防技术人员参加的复查小组，在庆功大会上作了余江县根除血吸虫病复查报告。报告说，复查小组在今年5月中旬分别在余江县内流行血吸虫病的马荃、马冈、弓塘、倪桂等四个乡和一个镇、两个农场里进行了大面积钉螺现场复查、病人粪便普查和粪便、饮用水管理的效果测定检查：结果，在这些地区里没有发现一个钉螺；从对四百七十二人的粪便普查中得出的治疗率为95.5％；现在在所有疫区里都已废除了私人厕所，建立和改建了小型公共厕所，每个厕所都有专人负责管理；并建立了公用水井、每个井都有公用吊桶，没有水井的地区便划定了河水分段、分塘饮、用水的区域，充分保证了群众生产和生活的安全。报告说，复查结果证明余江县在消灭钉螺、治疗血吸虫病、粪便和用水管理等方面都完全达到了中央血防工作部门的根本消灭血吸虫病的标准。
    中共余江县委第一书记李俊九向到会的全省一百多个血防干部介绍了余江县消灭血吸虫病的情况和经验。李俊九说，解放前余江县由于血吸虫病严重流行，很多村庄人死屋倒，田园荒芜，生产水平极低。如马冈乡在近三十多年内就有六个村庄因血吸虫病而全部毁灭，1956年1月全国农业发展纲要草案公布后，中共余江县委根据纲要草案消灭血吸虫病的规定和当地的具体情况，大胆地制定了苦战两年消灭血吸虫病的规划，并由县委第一书记挂帅担任血防五人小组组长，随即各区、乡、社都成立了血防工作领导组织，迅速开展了这一工作。李俊九说，为了不影响生产，余江县把消灭血吸虫病工作和生产紧密结合进行，县委为此曾提出了“以生产为中心，血防为重点”的原则，具体要求消灭钉螺、粪便管理和修水利、积肥相结合，治疗病人和农时安排相结合。在两年的冬、春兴修水利积肥的时候，县委发动和领导农民结合进行了“开新沟填旧沟”的土埋钉螺工作，结果在兴修水利中把全县的三百七十多条弯弯曲曲、杂草丛生的旧沟全部填了土，新开了水沟，使钉螺没有了藏身之所。治疗血吸虫病病人是由防治站同区、乡、社共同统一安排，在农闲时对主要劳动力治疗，农忙时治小孩、妇女、学生和渔民，因此既没有影响生产又充分利用了病床，使全县四千多个病人都分别得到了治疗。李俊九说，消灭血吸虫病后，余江县在生产、生活、生育等各方面都出现蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
