The Ceylon language problem is one of the many complex problems left over from British colonial rule. After Britain seized Ceylon from the Netherlands at the end of the 18th century, it made every effort to expand the use of English in Ceylon, causing severe rejection of the national languages of Ceylon. In the struggle of the Ceylonese people against British colonial rule, the issue of using national languages has always been a major matter of national concern. After Ceylon became a dominion within the British Commonwealth in 1948, English was no longer the official language, and the question of which national language should be used as the national language became an urgent practical problem.

Ceylon, with a population of 8.5 million, is a multi-ethnic country, with Sinhalese, Tamils, Indians, Arabs, Malays, etc., of which about 70% speak Sinhalese and more than 20% speak Tamil. In addition, a small number speak English. The Sinhalese live in the south and central regions, and the Tamils live in the north and northeast. The former mostly engage in agriculture and plantations, and the latter mostly engage in industry and commerce.

On June 15, 1956, the Ceylon House of Representatives passed a bill making Sinhalese the national language, and the Governor of Ceylon approved the bill in July. Since the bill was proposed, residents who speak Tamil have demanded that their language enjoy the same status as Sinhalese, and riots have continuously occurred throughout the country.

Last July, the Prime Minister of Ceylon and the leader of the influential Federal Party among the Tamils reached a compromise agreement on the language issue, recognizing Tamil as the language of the minority and stipulating that, without prejudice to the official status of Sinhalese, Tamil should become the language used administratively in the Northern and Northeastern Provinces where Tamil is spoken. However, this agreement was opposed by the United National Party. Recently, conflicts have occurred between Sinhalese, who wanted to paint over Tamil characters in front of shops, and Tamils.

The British magazine "Eastern World" in its February issue revealed the American conspiracy to use the language problem to create division and opposition to the government in Ceylon. The article said that the United States instigated both Sinhalese and Tamils to launch attacks on the government.

Many Ceylonese politicians and newspapers have condemned American sabotage. (Apologies)

    锡兰语言问题
    锡兰的语言问题，是英国殖民统治所遗留下来的许多复杂问题之一。英国在十八世纪末从荷兰手中夺取了锡兰以后，就竭力在锡兰扩大英语的使用，使锡兰民族语言受到严重的排斥。在锡兰人民反对英国殖民统治的斗争中，使用民族语言问题一直成为全国关心的重大事情。1948年锡兰成为英联邦内的自治领以后，英语不再作为正式语言，因而应当用那一种民族语言做为国语，更成了迫切的实际问题。
    拥有八百五十万人口的锡兰，是一个多民族国家，有僧伽罗人、泰米尔人、印度人、阿拉伯人、马来人等等，其中操僧伽罗语的约占70％左右，操泰米尔语的占20％以上。此外还有少部分使用英语。僧伽罗人住在南部和中部，泰米尔人住在北部和东北部。前者多半从事农业和种植园，后者多半从事工商业。
    1956年6月15日，锡兰众议院通过了以僧伽罗语为国语的法案，7月锡兰总督批准了这一法案。自从这个法案提出以后，操泰米尔语的居民就要求他们的语言和僧伽罗语享有同等的地位，因而在全国各地不断发生了骚动。
    去年7月，锡兰总理和泰米尔人中有影响的联邦党的领袖就语言问题达成折衷协议，承认泰米尔语是少数民族的语言，在不损害僧伽罗语的官方地位的情况下，泰米尔语应当成为通行泰米尔语的北方省和东北方省行政上使用的语言。但这个协议遭到统一国民党的反对。最近由于僧伽罗人想涂抹商店门前的泰米尔文，而同泰米尔人发生了冲突。
    今年二月号的英国“东方世界”杂志，曾揭露美国利用语言问题在锡兰制造分裂和反对政府的行动阴谋。文章说，美国唆使僧伽罗人和泰米尔人都向政府发动攻击。
    锡兰许多政治家和报纸都谴责美国的破坏活动。　（恕）
