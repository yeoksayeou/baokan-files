　　Don't Break Branches When Picking Mulberry Leaves

　　Silkworm rearing is a very good sideline production, which can provide industrial raw materials and increase the income of cooperatives. However, some commune members do not pay attention to protecting mulberry trees when picking mulberry leaves. On April 29th, I returned to school from a meeting in Hengyang County and passed through Zhangshu Cooperative in Banqiao Township. I saw seven women and children picking mulberry leaves. They didn't bring any tools and were all breaking branches from the mulberry trees. I went up to persuade them, but no one paid much attention. They said that breaking branches was more convenient, and the branches could also be used as firewood.

    To raise silkworms, we must protect mulberry trees. If the branches are broken, how can mulberry leaves grow? Without mulberry leaves, how can we raise silkworms? I suggest that the local agricultural cooperative should educate its members to pay attention to protecting mulberry trees and teach them to hold the tip of the branch with one hand and pick the leaves with the other when picking mulberry leaves, and never break the branches.

　　采桑叶不要折树枝
    养蚕是一门很好的副业生产，既可以提供工业原料，又可以增加合作社的收入。可是有些社员摘桑叶时不注意保护桑树。4月29日，我从衡阳县开完会回学校，路过板桥乡樟树社，看见七个妇女和小孩在采桑叶，他们没有带工具，都在桑树上折枝。我走近去说服他们，可是谁也不大理睬。她们说折枝方便些，树枝还可以当柴烧。
    要养蚕，就要保护桑树，如果把树枝折了，怎能长桑叶呢？没有桑叶，又怎样养蚕呢？我建议该地农业社要教育社员注意保护桑树，并教她们采桑叶时，用一只手把树枝尖拿住，另一只手摘叶子，千万不要折枝。
