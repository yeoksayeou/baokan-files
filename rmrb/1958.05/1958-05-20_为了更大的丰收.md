　　For an Even Greater Harvest
    The Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued instructions requiring the proper preparation for the summer pre-distribution work. The instructions clearly stated that it is necessary to call on the masses to "work hard for three years, expand public accumulation, expand reproduction, and store more reserve grain"; and to further enhance the socialist consciousness of the vast number of commune members through extensive debate. With the bumper wheat harvest just around the corner, it is essential to promptly put forward the correct handling of the distribution relationship between the state, the agricultural cooperatives, and the commune members, in order to strive for a double harvest in both production and ideology.
    Correctly handling the relationship between accumulation and consumption will expand funds for the comprehensive leap forward in production and a greater harvest next year, and it will encourage the production enthusiasm of the commune members. Through the summer pre-distribution and through extensive debate, the vast number of commune members can correctly understand the relationship between accumulation and consumption, and clearly recognize that expanding reproduction requires expanding public accumulation, and expanding public accumulation can strive for a greater harvest next year. This shows that the summer pre-distribution is not only a meticulous economic task, but also a major political task. We wish all regions a great harvest of grain and a great harvest of thought.

　　为了更大的丰收
    中共河南省委发出指示，要求作好夏季预分工作。指示中明确提出，要号召群众“苦战三年，扩大公共积累，扩大再生产，多搞储备粮”；并通过大辩论进一步提高广大社员的社会主义觉悟。麦季大丰收即将到来，及时提出正确处理国家、农业社和社员之间的分配关系，以争取生产和思想双丰收，是非常必要的。
    正确处理积累和消费的关系，就能为生产全面大跃进和明年更大的丰收扩大资金，就能鼓舞社员生产积极性。通过夏收预分，通过大辩论，使广大社员正确认识积累和消费的关系，明确认识扩大再生产必须扩大公共积累，扩大公共积累才能争取明年更大的丰收。这说明夏季预分既是一项细致的经济工作，又是一项重大的政治工作。我们预祝各地都能取得粮食大丰收，思想大丰收。
