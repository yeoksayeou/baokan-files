    Diligent Labor, Diligent Study, Change the Social Atmosphere
    Wu Yuzhang Talks About Work-Study Programs and a New Style of Study
    (Our newspaper's reporter Bai Sheng reports:) In our country's universities and middle schools, the vast number of young students are carrying out various work-study activities with unparalleled enthusiasm. Work-study programs have already become a common practice in many schools.
    However, in the process of promoting and carrying out work-study programs, some ideological problems worthy of attention have also been exposed. Some people still express doubts about the work-study approach, believing that it will hinder students' studies. They say that if students have to spend part of their time working and farming, they will inevitably reduce their study time and divert their energy, and the result of this approach will outweigh the gains. Although some people agree with work-study programs, they only focus on understanding its significance from an economic point of view, believing that students can solve the difficulties in tuition and living expenses through working and farming. They do not fully understand this important socialist education principle of cultivating new-type intellectuals and building talents needed by socialism.
    For this reason, the reporter visited Comrade Wu Yuzhang, a veteran revolutionary and educator who personally organized and advocated work-study programs in France forty years ago, and asked him to talk to today's educators and young students about work-study programs.
    Comrade Wu focused on the significance of work-study programs, and he profoundly criticized some people who believed that promoting work-study programs only had economic significance but no political significance.
    Comrade Wu said: The work-study programs we are promoting now cannot be completely compared with the meaning of the work-study era in France forty years ago. There have been great changes in both purpose and approach. Today, our promotion of work-study programs is precisely our educational policy. Our education must be combined with production. Now we must study on the one hand and work on the other. This approach varies depending on each person's study situation; some can often work and study at the same time; some can use winter and summer vacations to concentrate on working for a period of time; some can take a few hours of their spare time each week to work. Whether it is working in the fields, working in factories, or other labor, it is all learning in labor practice. This not only combines book knowledge with production practice, but also combines mental labor with physical labor. The political significance of the work-study programs we are promoting today mainly lies in combining mental and physical labor in society, changing the situation of separation between mental and physical labor in society, and changing the atmosphere in society of despising physical labor. Of course, labor can also help solve some of the economic difficulties in students' studies, and reduce some of the burdens on families and the country. This significance is also very important. But we must never limit the significance of work-study programs to the economic aspect. More importantly, it should still be its political significance, changing the disconnection between mental and physical labor. As long as everyone values both mental and physical labor, this can not only transform people's thinking, but also change the atmosphere in society. We must deeply recognize the important political significance of today's work-study programs.
    Comrade Wu believes that promoting work-study programs is one of the best ways to transform society, transform nature, and transform people's thinking. He said: Young students, while working and studying, can not only improve their physical and mental health and transform their thinking in labor, but also if everyone in society is diligent in labor and diligent in study, the entire social atmosphere will change. Vigorous socialist construction requires everyone to be full of vigor, especially young people to be full of vitality, working and studying at the same time, and becoming laborers with technology and culture. In this way, we can completely change nature, conquer nature, and develop science.
    Speaking of this, Comrade Wu said excitedly: Today, our party is calling on everyone in the rectification campaign to eliminate bureaucracy, stagnation, extravagance, arrogance, and squeamishness, so that we can truly integrate with workers and peasants, be with the people, and transform our society. Now, if you go to the countryside to take a look, the atmosphere of diligence in labor among men, women, old and young is really remarkable. This makes us believe that human power can change nature and society!
    Comrade Wu told us that what hinders learning is not work-study programs, but many people have bad ideas of individualism in pursuing fame and profit. This kind of bad idea is the real thing that hinders learning. Our promotion of work-study programs is to eliminate this kind of bad idea and promote the combination of mental and physical labor, the combination of theory and practice, and the atmosphere of in-depth research in science. Comrade Wu said that now that productivity is developing and science is also leaping forward, we must conduct in-depth research and put in more mental and physical labor to further develop science and better serve socialist construction. Then he said that Chinese intellectuals are actually very superficial. In the past, many intellectuals in old China only knew how to pursue fame and profit. After becoming officials, they were unwilling to study again, so it was impossible to achieve true talent and practical learning. If we want to seriously learn something, we must study hard and seek knowledge in labor practice. Even if it takes decades to figure out the truth, it is also valuable. The hard-working spirit of some famous scientists in the world in pursuit of truth is worth learning. Today, our promotion of work-study programs also requires promoting this spirit of diligent research and down-to-earth work and down-to-earth study. (Attached picture)

    勤于劳动，刻苦学习，改变社会风气
    吴玉章谈勤工俭学和新学风
    本报讯　记者柏生报道：在我们祖国的高等学校和中等学校里，广大青年学生以无比的热情，开展了各种勤工俭学的活动。勤工俭学已经在不少学校里形成了风气。
    但是，就在提倡和开展勤工俭学的过程中，也暴露了一些值得重视的思想问题。还有些人对勤工俭学的作法表示怀疑，他们认为勤工俭学会妨碍学生的学习，他们说学生要拿出一部分时间去做工、种地，就必然要减少学习时间，分散了精力，这样作法的结果会得不偿失。还有一些人虽然赞成勤工俭学，但他们却只着重从经济上理解它的意义，认为学生可以从做工、种地中解决学费和生活费用方面的困难，对通过勤工俭学来培养新型的知识分子、培养社会主义所需要的建设人材这一重要的社会主义教育原则，还不大理解。
    为了这个缘故，记者访问了四十年前曾经亲身组织和倡导留法勤工俭学的革命老长辈、老教育家吴玉章同志，请他给今天的教育工作者、青年学生们谈谈勤工俭学的问题。
    吴老着重向我们谈了勤工俭学的意义，他对有些人认为提倡勤工俭学只有经济意义，没有政治意义，进行了深刻的批判。
    吴老说：现在我们所提倡的勤工俭学已经和四十年前留法勤工俭学时代的意义不能完全相比了，不管是在目的上还是在作法上都有了很大的变化。今天我们提倡勤工俭学，这也正是我们的教育方针。我们的教育是要和生产相结合。现在我们一方面要学习，一方面要劳动。这种做法，也因每个人的学习情况不同，有各种做法；有的可以经常一面劳动，一面读书；有的可以利用寒暑假集中劳动一个时期；有的可以每周课余抽出几小时劳动。无论是在农田里劳动还是在工厂中做工，或是其他劳动，都是在劳动实践中学习。这样不但可以使书本知识和生产实践相结合，也使脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合。我们今天所提倡的勤工俭学的政治意义，主要就是在使社会上脑力劳动和体力劳动结合起来，改变社会上脑力劳动和体力劳动脱离的情况，使社会上轻视体力劳动的风气改变过来。当然，在劳动中也可以帮助解决学生学习上的一部分经济困难，使家庭和国家都减轻一些负担，这个意义也很重要。但是我们绝对不能只把勤工俭学的意义停留在经济方面的意义上，更重要的应该还是它的政治意义，改变脑力劳动和体力劳动的脱节。只要大家既重视脑力劳动又重视体力劳动，这样不但可以改造人的思想，也可以改变社会上的风气。我们要深刻地认识今天勤工俭学的这个重要的政治意义。
    吴老认为提倡勤工俭学是改造社会、改造大自然、改造人的思想的最好方法之一。他说：青年学生一面劳动，一面读书，不但可以增进身心健康，在劳动中改造思想，而且如果社会上大家都勤于劳动，刻苦学习，这样，整个的社会风气就会变了。蓬勃的社会主义建设需要我们每个人生气勃勃，尤其是青年人要富有朝气，一面劳动，一面读书，做有技术、有文化的劳动者，这样我们改变大自然，征服大自然，发展科学就完全有可能了。
    谈到这里，吴老兴奋地说：今天，我们党在整风中号召大家打掉官气、暮气、阔气、骄气和娇气，这样才能真正和工农结合起来，和人民群众在一起，改造我们的社会。现在如果下乡看一看，男女老少一片勤于劳动的风气，真是了不起，这使我们相信靠人力是可以改变大自然和社会的！
    吴老告诉我们，妨碍学习的不是勤工俭学，而是许多人有个人主义追求名利的坏思想，这种坏思想是真正阻碍学习的东西，我们提倡勤工俭学的风气，正是要去掉这种坏思想，提倡脑力劳动和体力劳动相结合，理论和实际结合，深入钻研科学的风气。吴老说，现在生产力发展了，科学也在跃进，我们一定要深入研究，付出更多的思想上和体力上的劳动，才能使科学有进一步的发展，更好地为建设社会主义服务。接着他说，中国知识分子实际上是非常浮浅的，过去，旧中国许多知识分子只知追求名利，做了官以后，就不肯再学习了，因此不可能做到真才实学。我们要想认真学一样东西，就要刻苦学习，在劳动实践中去求知识，即使花几十年功夫才得出道理来，也是可贵的。世界上有些著名科学家探求真理的苦干精神是值得学习的。我们今天提倡勤工俭学，也要提倡这种刻苦钻研和踏实地干、踏实地学习的风气。（附图片）
