    The Flowers of Ideological Emancipation are in Full Bloom
    -- One of the Communications on Local Industry in Zunyi County
    By our reporters Zhou Jingyu and Guo Longchun

    In Guizhou, if you want to understand the drive of county-level industry, people will naturally introduce you to Zunyi County.

    Following the Sichuan-Guizhou Highway north from Guiyang for one hundred and ninety kilometers, you will reach Zunyi. This is a famous historical city, where the well-known Zunyi Conference in the history of the Chinese revolution was held.

    Old foundations can't even match the income from raising chickens

    In the past, apart from Zunyi City (a province-administered city) having a little industry, the county-run industries totaled no more than twenty, all of which were made with indigenous methods and manual labor. Such as native paper mills, small flour mills, brick and tile lime factories and so on. They couldn't process their own tobacco, so they had to transport it to Chongqing and Guilin; they couldn't process their own tea, so they had to transport it to Xikang; they couldn't process their own hogs, so they had to transfer them to other places; there were many things where they first transported the raw materials out, and then transported the products in, and a large part of the people's necessities for production and life relied on supplies from other places. A comrade from the County Industry Section said that the output value of local industry in Zunyi County (including handicrafts) only accounted for 0.85% of the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1952, and although it increased twelve times in 1957, it still only accounted for 5.41% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, not even matching the income of the county's farmers from raising chickens. What a meaningful metaphor this is!

    Could it be that there are no conditions for running industry here? No, the conditions are very good. There are iron ore deposits everywhere in the county. The iron ore layers in the three districts of Tuanxi, Shangji, and Xiping are very thick, with large reserves and high grade, with an iron content of more than 70%; every township has coal mines, and many coal seams are exposed, which can be mined without exploration. In addition, the reserves of sulfur, manganese, mercury, and phosphorus mines are also very large. Moreover, the geology here is mostly limestone, and lime can be burned everywhere on hillsides and in valleys. As for the resources on the ground, they are countless. Here, the annual output of tobacco leaves is about 25 million jin, rapeseed 21 million dan, tea 2,000 dan, and rosin 10 million jin. There are even more wild raw materials that can be used all over the mountains and fields. The above are some visible resources, and there are still those undiscovered resources, which cannot be clarified for a while. The County Industry Section displayed various kinds of stones, all sent by the masses on their own initiative. Due to incomplete testing equipment, some still cannot figure out what is contained inside. Geological exploration teams often fence off a barren mountain and do not allow movement, and when the masses ask them what kind of mine it is, they can't say why, so they have to vaguely say it's "confidential."

    Simultaneous development of industry and agriculture
      A great opening of minds

    Since there are such good conditions, why is the industrial output value so pitifully small? The fundamental reason is that in the past, industry was seen as very mysterious, and people didn't dare to think about it or do it.

    The situation of the great leap forward in agriculture requires people to vigorously build water conservancy projects, accumulate a large amount of fertilizer, and improve the soil. Here, most of the soil is acidic, and lime is the best fertilizer for improving acidic soil, and it is also an indispensable material for building water conservancy projects, which requires the production of a large amount of lime; in order to burn lime, a large amount of coal is needed. In the past, they were accustomed to using charcoal as fuel. After closing the mountains for afforestation, they had to switch to coal, which requires a large amount of raw coal to be mined; as a result of eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene, it is necessary to rebuild pig pens and toilets and implement the separation of humans and livestock, which requires the production of a large number of bricks and tiles. In addition, the situation of the great leap forward in agriculture also urgently requires people to innovate technology and improve agricultural tools, which requires the manufacture of agricultural machinery. In short, there are many needs in agricultural production. Under such circumstances, local industry must keep up. As a result, what people didn't dare to think about is now being thought about, and what people didn't dare to do is now being done. The concept of mystifying industry has begun to shake in people's minds. However, the minds are not yet fully open.

    After the Party Central Committee's policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture was implemented in the county, the county's four-level cadre conference examined the concept of mystification, and one by one opened their minds. Then, they also determined personnel at all levels specifically in charge of industry in the organizational structure. As a result, those who originally planned to do a little are now preparing to do a lot. Many districts have put forward great leap forward slogans. Xiazi District put forward the slogan of "hundred-factory township, thousand-factory district," Nanbai District proposed "take the plane, take the rocket, industry and agriculture fly side by side," Songlin District proposed "think big and do big, break through a thousand difficulties, overcome ten thousand difficulties, develop local industry," and Shangji District proposed "surveying in one day, running factories day and night, starting in three days, and seeing results in five days." It is a lively and energetic scene.

    At first, we were a little doubtful: how can a factory be built in three days? Comrades from the Industry and Transportation Department of the County Party Committee gave us a statistical material. This spring, 206 factories and mines have been built and put into production, including defluorinated phosphate fertilizer, granular fertilizer, sulfur, iron smelting, papermaking, coal plants, pulp, rayon, pottery, bamboo ware, saltpeter, alternative brewing, shoe polish, sugar, soy sauce and vinegar, bean curd sheets, and cattle and horse carts. 8,294 industrial items run by agricultural cooperatives have already been put into production. On average, a factory or mine is put into production every one and a half minutes (assuming twelve hours a day). In the past, factories like defluorinated phosphate fertilizer and rayon were not even names in people's minds, but now they have become familiar factories. According to scientific data, the manufacture of defluorinated phosphate fertilizer requires an electric furnace rotary kiln to meet the defluorination requirements, but now they use lime-burning earthen kilns to burn defluorinated phosphate fertilizer. This fact further proves the correctness of the Central Committee's policy of simultaneously developing central industry and local industry. The Central Committee pointed out: "Since local industry has a more direct and closer connection with agriculture, the implementation of this policy can more effectively develop industry and agriculture simultaneously and support each other, and can mobilize the enthusiasm of local authorities to run industry and the enthusiasm of the people to run industry more widely and fully, which will inevitably accelerate the speed of our country's industrialization and the speed of agricultural technical transformation." Judging from the situation in Zunyi County, it can be said that the enthusiasm of the people to run industry has been fully mobilized.

    Attractive Long-Term Planning

    At present, most of the local industries in Zunyi County that are developing the fastest are small factories operating with manual labor. As for those that need machinery, the development is slower. Comrade Liu Shaoqian of the County Party Committee told us: factories that operate with manual labor are generally completed in early May, because manual labor is relatively simple after all. Three or five people can build a coal mine and lime factory, without the need for factory buildings and offices; the difficulty lies in mechanical equipment, which needs to be purchased from other places, and is not so easy to obtain. For example, many townships and cooperatives want to set up a feed processing factory, but cannot buy a feed pulverizer; some brick and tile factories also want to switch to machine-made bricks, but cannot buy a brick-making machine. This fact shows that a county must have its own backbone industries to equip itself with the simple machinery it needs, so that the county's backbone industries and manual industries can be closely linked to form an urban-rural industrial network.

    Zunyi County has already included the county-level backbone industries in the plan. These backbone industries include:

    An agricultural tool factory equipped with thirty machine tools;
    A ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons;
    A thermal power plant with 2,250 kilowatts;
    A hydroelectric power station with 3,000 kilowatts;
    An iron-smelting furnace with an annual output of 10,000 tons;
    Two newly built coal mines and two expanded coal mines, with an annual output of 150,000 tons of coal.
    One each for other re-baking factories, oil extraction factories, paper mills, sugar mills, cement plants, silk reeling factories, coal-to-oil plants, and canning factories.

    With the specific assistance of the relevant departments of the Central Government and the provincial leading organs, most of the above fourteen projects will start construction in the second half of this year and be put into production in the first half of next year. At present, they are actively raising funds, preparing the necessary basic construction, and resolutely adopting the method of using the factory to support the factory, expanding the accumulation of existing industrial production, and achieving the development of local industry.

    Zunyi County plans to have an industrial output value of 50 million yuan this year, and 450 million yuan by 1962 (at that time, the agricultural output value will be 300 million yuan), accounting for 60% of the total industrial and agricultural output value, an increase of 87 times compared with 1957.

    Comrades from the State Planning Commission's working group helped them calculate two accounts:

    The first account: according to the plan, after completion, the total fiscal revenue of the county in the second five years will be 130 million yuan. In addition to agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, transportation, postal and telecommunications, culture and education, and administrative management expenses of 44 million yuan, the industrial investment of 50 million yuan and working capital of 35 million yuan can also be completely resolved.

    The second account: the total public accumulation of agricultural cooperatives in five years can reach 150 million yuan by 1962. Assuming that each cooperative adds ten tractors, three water pumps, and three trucks at that time, as well as repairing warehouses and building water conservancy projects, the total will be no more than 94 million yuan, leaving 56 million yuan without a place to spend.

    The above two accounts show that in order to realize the second five-year plan, Zunyi County's county industry will become a component of the national urban and rural industrial network, and Zunyi County's rural areas will be mechanized and electrified.

    A beautiful long-term plan is exerting tremendous magnetic force, attracting hundreds of thousands of people in Zunyi County to strive to change their faces and create their own happy lives under the policy of developing industry and agriculture simultaneously.

    思想解放鲜花开
    ——遵义县地方工业通讯之一
    本报记者　周静宇　郭龙春
    在贵州，你想了解县工业的干劲，人们很自然地介绍你到遵义县去。
    沿着川黔公路由贵阳北上一百九十公里，就到达遵义。这是历史名城，我国革命史上有名的遵义会议就是在这里召开的。
    旧基础顶不上养鸡收入
    过去，除了遵义市（省属市）有一点工业以外，县办的工业总共不过二十处，全部是土法制造、手工操作。诸如土法造纸厂、小型面粉厂、砖瓦石灰厂等等。烤烟自己不能加工，要运往重庆和桂林去；茶叶自己不能加工，要运到西康去；毛猪不能加工，要调运到外地去；有许多东西，先把原料运出去，接着又把产品运进来，人民生产和生活上的必需品有很大一部分靠外地供给。县工业科的同志说，遵义县的地方工业产值（包括手工业在内）在1952年只占工农业总产值的0.85％，1957年虽然增长十二倍，但仍只占到工农业总产值的5.41％，还抵不上全县农民养鸡的收入。这是多么意味深长的比喻啊！
    难道这里没有办工业的条件吗？不，条件很好。全县到处有铁矿，团溪、尚稽、西坪三个区的铁矿层很厚，藏量很大，品位很高，含铁量在70％以上；乡乡有煤矿，许多煤层露在外面，用不着勘探就可以采掘。另外，硫磺矿、锰矿、汞矿、磷矿等藏量也很大。而且这里的地质绝大部分是石灰岩，在山坡山凹里随处可以烧制石灰。至于地上的资源也是数不胜数。这里年产烟叶约二千五百万斤，菜籽两千一百万担，茶叶两千担，松脂一千万斤。满山遍野可以利用的野生原料则更多。以上是看得到的一些资源，还有那些没有发现的资源，就一时无法弄清了。县工业科陈列了各种各样的石块，都是群众自动送来的，由于化验设备不全，有些还弄不清里面含有什么东西。地质勘探队常常把一片荒山圈起来，不许动，群众问他们是什么矿，说不出个所以然来，只好含含糊糊地说是“保密”。
    工农业并举
      大开窍门
    既然有这样好的条件，为什么工业产值又小得那么可怜呢？根本原因是过去把工业看得很神秘，不敢想也不敢做。
    农业大跃进的形势，要求人们大力兴修水利，大量积肥，改良土壤。这里，大部分土壤是酸性土壤，而石灰是改良酸性土壤的最好肥料，又是兴修水利必不可少的材料，这就需要生产大量的石灰；为了烧制石灰，又需要大量的煤炭，过去习惯于用木炭作燃料的，在封山育林以后，不得不改用煤炭，这就需要大量开采原煤；由于除四害、讲卫生的结果，需要改建猪圈厕所，实行人畜分居，这就需要生产大批的砖瓦。此外，农业大跃进的形势，还迫切地要求人们革新技术，改良农具，这就需要制造农业机械。总之，农业生产的需要很多，在这样的形势下，地方工业不能不跟上去，于是，不敢想的想开了，不敢干的干开了，工业神秘化的观念在人们的思想里开始发生了动摇。不过，窍门开的还不大。
    党中央关于工农业同时并举的方针贯彻到县以后，县的四级干部会议上检查了神秘化观念，一个个打开了窍门，接着，又在组织机构上确定了各级专管工业的人员，于是，原来准备小干的，现在准备大干了，许多区提出了大跃进的口号，虾子区提出了“百厂乡、千厂区”的口号，南白区提出“乘飞机，坐火箭，工农业并肩齐飞”，松林区提出“大想大干，突破千个难关，克服万个困难，发展地方工业”，尚稽区提出“一天查勘，日夜办厂，三天办起来，五天见效”。轰轰烈烈，干劲十足。
    开始，我们有点怀疑：三天怎能办起一个工厂来呢？县委工业交通部的同志给了我们一份统计材料。今年春季已经建成投入生产的有脱氟磷肥、颗粒肥料、硫磺、炼铁、造纸、煤厂、纸浆、人造棉、陶器、竹器、火硝、代用品酿酒、皮鞋油、食糖、酱醋、豆腐皮、牛马板车等共二百零六项厂矿，农业社办的工业已经投入生产的有八千二百九十四项。平均每一分半钟（假定一天按十二小时计算）有一个厂矿投入生产。过去，像脱氟磷肥和人造棉这样的工厂在人们的脑子里连名字也没有，现在已经成为人们熟悉的工厂了。按照科学资料，制造脱氟磷肥需要电炉旋窑才能达到脱氟的要求，现在他们用烧石灰的土窑就把脱氟磷肥烧制出来了。这个事实，愈益证明中央关于中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针的正确性。中央指出：“由于地方工业同农业有更为直接更为密切的联系，所以，实行这个方针，就可以更有成效地使发展工业和发展农业同时并举和相互支援，就可以把地方办工业的积极性，人民群众办工业的积极性更广泛更充分地调动起来，从而必然会加快我国工业化的速度和农业技术改造的速度。”从遵义县的情况看来，人民群众办工业的积极性可以说是充分调动起来了。
    富有磁性的远景规划
    目前，遵义县地方工业发展最快的绝大部分属于手工操作的小型工厂，至于需用机械的那就比较迟缓了。县委刘绍乾同志告诉我们：凡是手工操作的工厂大体在5月上旬完成，因为手工操作毕竟比较简单，三、五个人可以建个煤矿和石灰厂，用不着厂房和办公室；困难的是机械设备，需要到外地采购，不是那末得心应手。譬如很多乡和社都想办个饲料加工厂，却买不到饲料粉碎机；有些砖瓦厂也想改用机器制砖，却买不到制砖机。这个事实，说明了一个县必须有自己的骨干工业，装备自己需要的简单机械，使县的骨干工业和手工操作的工业密切联系起来，形成一个城乡工业网。
    遵义县已经把县级的骨干工业列入了规划。这些骨干工业包括：
    三十台机床装备的农具厂一座；
    年产八千吨的碳酸氢铵化肥厂一座；
    二千二百五十瓩的火电站一个；
    三千瓩的水电站一个；
    年产一万吨的炼铁炉一座；
    新建煤矿两个，扩建煤矿两个，年产煤十五万吨。
    其他复烤厂、榨油厂、纸厂、糖厂、水泥厂、缫丝厂、煤炼油厂、罐头厂各一。
    以上十四个项目在中央各有关部门和省级领导机关具体帮助下，绝大部分在今年下半年开始兴建，明年上半年投入生产。现在，正在积极筹集资金，准备必要的基本建设，并且坚决采取以厂养厂的办法，扩大现有工业生产的积累，达到地方工业的发展。
    遵义县计划今年的工业产值为五千万，到1962年为四亿五千万元（那时农业产值为三亿），占工业农业总产值的60％，比1957年增长八十七倍。
    国家计委工作组的同志帮助他们算了两笔账：
    第一笔账：按规划完成后，第二个五年县财政收入合计为一亿三千万，除了农业、林业、水利、交通、邮电、文教、行政管理费用四千四百万，至于工业投资五千万，流动资金三千五百万，也完全可以解决了。
    第二笔账：五年内农业社的公共积累到1962年总数可达一亿五千万元。假定那时每社增添拖拉机十台、抽水机三台、卡车三辆、以及修仓库、办水利等等，总共不过九千四百万，还剩下五千六百万没处花销。
    以上两笔账，说明实现第二个五年计划遵义县的县工业就成为全国城乡工业网的一个组成部分，遵义县的农村就是机械化、电气化的农村了。
    一幅美丽的远景规划正在发生巨大的磁力，吸引着遵义县的几十万人民在工农业并举的方针下为改变面貌、创造自己的幸福生活而奋斗。
