    Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Panama City, the capital of Panama, experienced a general student strike on the 22nd. Striking students clashed on a large scale with the National Guard, who were carrying out suppression, within the city. All shops were closed, and traffic was completely paralyzed.
    Three days prior (on the 19th), three thousand Panamanian middle school students held a demonstration protesting the government's failure to improve school facilities. The National Guard suppressed the demonstrating students, fatally shooting one student. Enraged students therefore demanded that Panamanian President de la Guardia dismiss the Minister of Education and three senior commanders of the National Guard. This general strike occurred after the government refused the students' demands.
    Following the outbreak of the general strike, fully armed National Guardsmen surrounded the headquarters of the striking students, forcibly dispersing them with submachine guns, rifles, and tear gas. Students built barricades in the streets and defended themselves with stones, sticks, and bottles. As of the afternoon of the 22nd, conflicts were still ongoing in several parts of the city, resulting in nine deaths and sixty-one injuries.
    The Panamanian government has declared a thirty-day state of emergency nationwide.

    巴拿马首都局势紧张
    罢课学生抗击军警镇压
    新华社23日讯　巴拿马首都巴拿马市的学生22日举行总罢课。罢课的学生和进行镇压的国民警卫队在市内发生了大规模的冲突。全城商店关闭，交通完全瘫痪。
    三天以前（19日），三千名巴拿马中学生曾经举行了一次示威，抗议政府不改善学校设备。国民警卫队对示威学生进行了镇压，开枪打死了一个学生。激愤的学生们因此要求巴拿马总统德拉古迪亚把教育部长和国民警卫队的三名高级指挥官撤职。这次总罢课是在政府拒绝了学生这一要求以后发生的。
    在总罢课爆发以后，全副武装的国民警卫队包围了罢课学生的总部，用手提机关枪、步枪和催泪瓦斯强行驱散学生。学生们在街道上构筑了障碍物，用石子、棍棒、瓶子进行自卫。截至22日下午为止，在全城几个地方冲突仍在继续中，已经有九人死亡，六十一人受伤。
    巴拿马政府已经宣布全国紧急戒严三十天。
