Why?

    Some Glass Cannot Be Polished Brightly
    Some glass windows cannot be polished brightly even with alcohol or cleaning powder. This is because the glass undergoes chemical changes in the air, losing its original transparency.
    The raw materials of glass are mostly alkaline silicates. After the glass absorbs moisture, the alkaline silicates undergo hydrolysis to generate free alkali. This free alkali then reacts with carbon dioxide in the air to form a layer of carbonates. The newly formed carbonates also have the ability to absorb moisture, which allows the water layer on the glass surface and the alkaline silicates in the lower layer of the glass to continue to undergo hydrolysis. Over time, this causes streaks of opacity to appear on the glass. This is known as weathering of glass in chemistry.
    The way to avoid weathering is to clean the window glass frequently to keep it clean. (Book)

专栏：为什么？

    有些玻璃擦不亮
    有些玻璃窗，用酒精、去污粉等都不能把它擦亮，这是因为玻璃在空气中起了化学变化，失去了原来的透明性质。
    玻璃的原料大部是矽酸碱类。玻璃吸收水分后，矽酸碱类便发生水解作用而生成游离的碱。这种游离碱再与空气中的碳酸气作用而生成一层碳酸盐。新生成的碳酸盐，也具有吸收水气的性能，这样就使玻璃表面之水层与下层玻璃中之矽酸碱类继续发生水解作用。天长日久，就使玻璃上出现一道道的不透明的条纹。这在化学上称之为玻璃的风化作用。
    避免发生风化的办法，就是经常擦窗玻璃，使它保持清洁。（书）
