Xinhua News Agency, Gaomi, 29th - Since Liu Lianren returned to his hometown, he has received meticulous care and attention from the local government, agricultural cooperative, relatives, and neighbors. His daily life has become convenient, and his health is beginning to improve.

    Days before Liu Lianren arrived home, the Gaomi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Gaomi County People's Committee sent people to his hometown to help him settle in. Cadres from the local agricultural cooperative and male and female members had long begun to repair his house and purchase furniture for him. The production team leader led members to whitewash Liu Lianren's house, and all the necessities for daily life were prepared.

    Back in his home, Liu Lianren felt warmth everywhere, and his daily life was very convenient. He often held the hands of his fellow villagers and said, "How can I repay everyone's kindness!" Relatives and neighbors, knowing the suffering Liu Lianren endured in Japan, were concerned about his health, and everyone gave him their best food to eat. Since hearing that Liu Lianren was coming home, the mother of neighbor Li Guiqing had been saving the eggs laid by her chickens every day. On the day before Liu Lianren arrived home, she bought two catties of fresh fish and eggs and sent them over together. Some old ladies in their seventies and eighties also gave Liu Lianren the few eggs they had saved.

    The local agricultural cooperative has made specific arrangements for Liu Lianren's future life. The main priority now is for him to rest and recuperate well. After he has largely recovered his health, the cooperative will formally assign him work.

    各方关怀无微不至
    刘连仁在家乡感到无限温暖
    新华社高密29日电　刘连仁回到家乡后，受到当地政府、农业社和亲友邻舍们无微不至的关怀和照顾，生活起居感到方便，健康情况开始好转。
    在刘连仁到家以前好多天，中共高密县委、高密县人民委员会就派人到他的家乡，会同当地政府替他安家。当地农业社的干部和男女社员们，很早就着手替刘连仁修缮房屋、购置家具。生产队长带领社员把刘连仁的房屋粉刷一新，居家常用的东西，也都准备得一应俱全。
    刘连仁回到家里，感到处处温暖，起居生活非常方便。他不时地拉着乡亲们的手说：“我怎么来答谢大家的恩情啊！”亲友邻舍们知道刘连仁在日本受的苦难深重，都关心着他的健康，大家把自己最好的东西送给他吃。邻居李桂清的母亲自从听说刘连仁要回家来，就每天把鸡下的蛋留起来，在刘连仁到家的头一天，她又买上两斤鲜鱼和鸡蛋一起送了去。有些七、八十岁的老太太，也把存下的几个鸡蛋送给刘连仁。
    当地农业社对刘连仁今后的生活已经作了具体安排。目前主要是让他好好养息，等大体恢复健康后，社里再正式分配他工作。
