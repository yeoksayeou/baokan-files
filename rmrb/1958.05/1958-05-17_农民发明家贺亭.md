Peasant Inventor He Ting
By our staff reporter Zhu Cheng

　　Among the water conservancy construction tools exhibited in the agricultural machinery hall of the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition, a high-slope earth-transporting tool has received widespread praise. This tool is a hand-operated and power-driven dual-purpose automatic earth-transporting machine that transports earth from low to high places. (See picture)

    Operating this machine to transport earth is not complicated: a person shakes the wooden wheel on the cart frame at the bottom of the slope, and the driving rawhide rope drives the earth-filled cart along the steel wire track from bottom to top until it climbs onto the crescent-shaped wooden rail. Then the cart runs down the steel wire. When it reaches the end of the track on the slope, the cart flips sharply after passing through a curved track in a wooden frame; the earth is thrown out, and the cart, due to the force, quickly and automatically runs from the lower end of the curved track to the rear of the cart frame at the bottom of the slope. The operator then shakes a crank, cranking the empty cart along the curved track onto the cart frame, then loading it with earth again, and then operating it in the same way.... In this way, when actually transporting earth on the construction site, eight carts circulate back and forth, transporting very quickly, with an efficiency eight times higher than carrying by humans. If some steel parts are replaced and driven by power machinery, even more and faster transportation will be achieved!

    Those who visited the operation demonstration of this earth-transporting machine were amazed by its dexterity, ease of use, and simple manufacture. Several visitors from the Wuhan Municipal Transportation and Loading and Unloading Company and several earthworkers from a basic construction site in Beijing were most interested in this earth-transporting machine because using this earth-transporting machine would free them from heavy manual labor.

    The inventor of the earth-transporting machine is He Ting, an illiterate peasant from the Hongxing Second Cooperative in Tanghe County, Henan Province.

    In early November of last year, the Hongxing Second Cooperative planned to excavate four ponds with a total area of ​​22 mu. The shortage of labor was serious. The deeper the ponds were dug, the lower the efficiency of people transporting earth outwards became. Therefore, some cooperative members became worried: "With such a large project and so few people, how can we guarantee a bumper harvest if we can't finish the construction?"

    At this time, encouraged by the Party organization, He Ting considered a way to transport earth automatically.

    He heard people say that an agricultural cooperative in Xinye County was developing "lifting water to the upland." He thought: if we can "lift water to the upland," can't we "lift earth to the upland"? The embankment is higher than the bottom of the pond, but if we use something to lift the earth from the bottom of the pond to a place higher than the embankment, can't we get it to the embankment? But how to get the earth from a place higher than the embankment to the embankment? One day, when he saw the scene of an ox cart rolling down a slope automatically, he decided to build an elevated track to transport the earth. A tall wooden frame was erected in the middle of this track, and the track was erected from the bottom of the pond from bottom to top to the tall wooden frame, and then from the tall wooden frame from top to bottom to the embankment, so that the cart with wheels could run on the track from bottom to top and then from top to bottom, transporting the earth to the embankment.

    The most brain-wracking thing was how to make the cart run from the bottom of the pond along the wire track to the top of the wooden frame. The first method he came up with was to erect a wooden frame at the beginning of the track at the bottom of the pond that was even higher than the middle wooden frame, and install a pulley at the top; the rope on the pulley was tied to the head of the track. After the earth-filled cart was placed on the track, the track was cranked up by shaking the pulley, and when it was cranked to a place higher than the middle wooden frame, the cart would automatically move. But when he thought about it, he found a problem: it was too unsafe for people to stand on such a high wooden frame and crank the pulley. At the same time, only one cart could move at a time, and the track had to be cranked and released, so the efficiency was too low!

    The transmission belt on the cotton gin helped him solve the problem. He thought: if a frame was made at the bottom of the pond, and the track was connected to the frame, and a hand-cranked wooden wheel was installed on the frame; and another wheel was installed on the middle wooden frame, then it would be possible to use these two wheels to drive the transmission belt, and it would be possible to bring the cart up along the track. How to hang the cart on the transmission belt? After repeated consideration, a solution came out: the transmission belt was changed to a rawhide rope with knots, and an iron fork was installed on the back of the cart. The iron fork was stuck on the rope knot, and when the wheel was cranked and the rawhide rope turned, it would bring the cart up! At this point, he felt immense pleasure, and felt that the problem was about to be completely solved. Later, he considered installing a crescent-shaped wooden rail on the middle wooden frame so that the wheels would not be suspended in the air at either end when they reached the top.

    After the experiment was successful, two machines were built. The cooperative members used this earth-transporting machine to transport earth, and the efficiency was greatly improved, and everyone was very happy. However, they also felt that after the cart automatically opened and unloaded the earth at the end, it had to be manually moved to another downward track. Therefore, the cooperative members hoped that He Ting would continue to research and improve it.

    He Ting accepted everyone's request. Finally, he came up with the idea of ​​setting up a wooden frame and a curved track at the end of the track. When the cart flipped down from the curved track, there would be things clamping it on both the front and the back to prevent it from derailing. In this way, the bottom of the cart could also be nailed shut - when the cart flipped down, the earth would naturally be thrown out. When making the third earth-transporting machine, he made it according to this design, and the result was another success.

    His earth-transporting machine was once taken to Zhengzhou for exhibition. At that time, when the empty cart ran to the bottom of the slope under the cart frame, it had to be manually moved upwards. So people gave him suggestions again, asking him to consider how to make the cart return to the cart frame without manual lifting. When he installed it in Beijing this time, he newly installed a curved track and a crank at the rear of the cart frame to crank the cart onto the cart frame. In this way, this automatic earth-transporting machine was finally successfully created.

    Before liberation, He Ting was originally a hired peasant. After liberation, his life completely changed. He has never read a book, but six of the eleven children of his three brothers have already gone to school. These facts made him deeply love the new society and love the cooperative. Especially after the rural great debate, his awareness became even higher. Therefore, in the high tide of production, he tried every means to improve and create tools. In addition to the earth-transporting machine, he also created five other things, such as a human-pulled automatic manure spreader and a ridge maker. At the exhibition, he was also greatly inspired by the improved and created agricultural tools from various places. He plans to go back and create several new agricultural tools.

　　农民发明家贺亭

    在全国农具展览会农田排灌机具馆里展出的水利施工工具中，有一件高坡运土工具受到了普遍的赞扬。这件工具就是从低处往高处运土的手摇、动力两用自动运土机。　（如图）
    操纵这架机器运土并不复杂：人在坡下摇动斗车架子上的木轮，传动的牛皮绳就带动盛土斗车沿着钢丝轨道从下而上爬到月牙形的木轨上，然后斗车顺着钢丝跑了下去。跑到坡上轨道尽头处，斗车经过一个木架里的弧形轨道，急遽地翻身；土，甩出去了，斗车因冲力由弧形轨道的下端，迅速地自动地跑到坡下斗车架子底下后部的时候，操纵的人又摇动一个摇把，把空斗车顺着弧形轨道绞到车架子上去，然后再装土，再照样运行……。这样，在工地上实际运土的时候，使八个斗车循环往复，运的飞快，效率比人担提高八倍。如果换上几个钢铁部件，用动力机械带动，还要运的更多更快！
    参观这架运土机操作表演的人，都为它的灵巧、好用和制造简单惊住了。来自武汉市交通运输管理局装卸公司的几个参观者和北京市一个基本建设工地的几个土工工人，对这架运土机最感兴趣，因为利用这种运土机就可以使他们摆脱繁重搬运劳动。
    发明运土机的是河南唐河县红星二社一个字不识的农民贺亭。
    去年11月初，红星二社计划要开挖四口总面积有二十二亩大的塘。劳力不足的情况是严重的，塘挖的越深，人们往外运土的效率越低，于是，有些社员发了愁：“工程这样大，人这样少，修不完怎能保证丰收呢？”
    这时候，贺亭在党组织的鼓励下考虑自动运土的办法。
    他听人们说，新野县的一个农业社在搞“提水上岗”。他便想：可以“提水上岗”，难道就不能“提土上岗”吗？塘堰比塘底高，但是把塘底的土用个什么物件提到比塘堰还高的地方，不是也可以弄到塘堰上去吗？但土怎样从比塘堰高的地方弄到塘堰上去呢？一天当他看到牛车下坡自动滚动的情景，便决定建造一条高空轨道来运土，在这条轨道的中间立上个高木架，让轨道从塘底由下而上架到高木架上，再由高木架由上而下架到塘堰上，让带轮的斗车在轨道上由下而上再由上而下的运行，把土运到塘堰上去。
    最费脑筋的事，是怎样使斗车从塘底沿着铁丝轨道跑到木架顶上去。他想出的第一个办法，是在塘底轨道开头处，立一个比中间的木架还高的木架，在顶端安上辘轳；辘轳上的绞绳，拴到轨道头上，轨道上放好盛土斗车以后，摇动辘轳把轨道绞起，绞到比中间的木架高的地方，斗车就自动走了。但一想又发现了问题：人站在那样高的木架上摇辘轳太不安全，同时一次只能走一车，还要绞轨道，放轨道，效率太低！
    弹花车上的传动带帮助他解决了问题。他想：在塘底下做个架子，轨道接到架子上，架子上安一个手摇木轮；中间的木架上也安个轮子，让这两个轮子带动传动带，就有可能把斗车顺着轨道带上去。斗车怎样挂在传动带上呢？经过反复考虑办法出来了，把传动带改成带结的牛皮绳，在斗车的后面安上铁叉，铁叉卡在绳结上，摇动轮子牛皮绳转的时候，就会带着斗车上去了！至此，他感到莫大的愉快，觉得问题快要全部解决了。以后，他又考虑在中间木架上安上个月牙形的木轨，好使车轮到顶上的时候两头都不悬空。
    试验成功以后，就造了两架。社员们使用这架运土机运土，效率大大提高了，大家都很高兴。但是，又感到斗车到头车底自动打开卸土以后，还得用人搬到另一条下行轨道上去，因此，社员们希望贺亭再研究改进。
    贺亭接受了大家的要求。终于想出在轨道尽头设一个木架和弧形轨道，斗车从弧形轨道往下翻的时候，前后都有东西夹着不会出轨。这样，车底也可以钉死了——车往下翻的时候，土当然要甩出去。在做第三架运土机时他按这设计做，结果又是成功了。
    他这架运土机曾经拿到郑州去展览。那时空车斗跑到坡下车架底下时，还得用人往上搬。所以人们又给他提出了建议，让他考虑怎样使斗车不用人搬就能回到车架上去。这次在北京安装的时候，他便在车架后部新安上了一个弧形轨和一个摇把，把斗车绞到车架上去，这样，这部自动运土机就最后创造成功了。
    贺亭在解放前原是雇农，解放后他的生活根本变了样。他一天书没读过，但是他们弟兄三人的十一个孩子，有六个大的已经上了学。这些事实，使他深深地热爱新社会，热爱合作社，特别是农村大辩论以后，他的觉悟更高了。因此，在生产高潮中他想方设法改良和创造工具。他创造的东西，除运土机外，还有人拉自动扬粪车、打畦器等五种。在展览会上，他又从各地来的改良和创制的农具中得到了很大启发，他准备回去再创造几件新农具。
