Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th: The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission held the first national on-site sports work conference in Tianjin from May 12th to 15th to summarize and promote the experience of the Tianjin Wool Processing Factory in carrying out grassroots mass sports activities. Representatives from twelve provinces and cities, including Henan, Hubei, Shanghai, and Beijing, as well as three sports associations, including the China Power Sports Association, attended the conference. The representatives at the meeting unanimously agreed that the experience of the Wool Processing Factory solved the problem of how to carry out grassroots sports activities.

　　The sports activities of the Wool Processing Factory started in 1951 and have continued uninterrupted for more than seven years. Sports not only strengthened the physique of the workers but also promoted the development of production. There are four basic experiences. The first is to put politics in command, with leaders taking the lead, closely integrating sports activities with enriching the cultural life of workers, reducing absenteeism, improving production efficiency, and ensuring the completion of production tasks. Therefore, the Party, government, labor union, and youth league all regard sports work as an important political task included in the work plan. Liu Chunxuan, the factory director and secretary of the Party general branch, is a sports activist, and all 56 leading cadres in the factory participated in sports activities.

　　The second experience is: sports serve production, educating workers to exercise their bodies well, demonstrate their skills in production, and combine participation in sports activities with doing a good job in production. Therefore, the development of sports activities has brought great benefits to production. The factory has overfulfilled its production plan every month for several years, and many workers are both sports activists and advanced producers. Last year, the attendance rate of more than 800 workers in the factory reached over 95%, and in the first quarter of this year, the attendance rate rose to over 96%, while the attendance rate of the 88 members of the sports team reached as high as 99.44%, of whom 37 were advanced producers.

　　The third experience is: first popularize, then improve, correctly solve the relationship between popularization and improvement. Before liberation, the working conditions in this factory were very bad, and more than 80% of the workers had occupational diseases. After liberation, although working conditions improved, the occupational diseases left to the workers over the years were not eradicated, and the workers' bodies were generally not good, which had a great impact on production. Since the factory began to promote broadcast gymnastics in 1951, it has found the "magic weapon" to change this situation—popularizing sports activities. However, difficulties were encountered as soon as popularization began: the characteristics of this factory are that the average age of the workers is 40 years old, young workers only account for more than 13%, and more than 130 female workers have children except for six. In this case, they tried to carry out a variety of sports activities to meet the requirements of different ages and different preferences. For example, rope skipping, shuttlecock kicking, diabolos, and short-distance running are promoted among female workers. Taijiquan, flower stick, etc., which are most popular among elderly workers, have also become active. The porters like wrestling, so they invited Hu Jingshan, an old worker with eighteen years of experience, to be the coach and organized a wrestling team. Young and middle-aged workers have more preferences, so the sports association promoted the labor and defense system among them, especially long-distance running, horizontal bars, parallel bars, vaulting boxes, and various ball games, attracting more and more people to participate. On the basis of popularization, sports skills are constantly improved, and various competitions, sports meets, and sports evenings are organized. Different projects are organized in different seasons. At the same time, they also participate in municipal and district sports meets, further encouraging the enthusiasm of the masses to participate in sports activities. Now, more than 95% of the factory's employees participate in broadcast gymnastics, 17 sports teams have been organized, the number of sports association members has grown to more than 350, and 96 people have reached the labor and defense system or athlete level standards. Now, the factory has achieved "activities every day, competitions every week."

　　The fourth experience is: follow the mass line, mobilize and rely on the masses to solve the difficulties in carrying out sports activities. The first problem encountered in carrying out sports activities is the problem of venues and equipment, which are solved by the workers themselves. The wrestling field and basketball court were built by mobilizing the masses themselves; the horizontal bars and volleyball posts were made by carpenters; the badminton racks were rushed out by fitters, welders, and painters using three lunch breaks.

　　天津绒毛厂坚持体育活动
    国家体委召开现场会议总结经验加以推广
    据新华社天津16日电　国家体育运动委员会5月12日到15日在天津召开全国第一次体育工作现场会议，总结推广了天津市绒毛加工厂在开展基层群众性体育活动中的经验。参加这次会议的有河南、湖北、上海、北京等十二省市和中国动力体育协会等三个体育协会的代表。参加会议的代表一致认为绒毛加工厂的经验解决了如何开展基层体育活动的问题。
    绒毛加工厂的体育活动是从1951年开始的，七年多来从未间断过。体育运动不仅增强了职工的体质，而且有利于生产的发展。它的基本经验有四条。首先是政治挂帅，领导带头，把开展体育活动同丰富职工文化生活和减少缺勤率、提高生产效率、保证完成生产任务紧密地结合起来。因此，党政工团都把体育工作当成一项重要政治任务列入工作计划。厂长兼党总支书记刘春轩就是一个体育积极分子，全厂五十六个领导干部都参加了体育活动。
    第二个经验是：体育为生产服务，教育职工锻炼好身体，在生产上显本领，把参加体育活动同搞好生产结合起来，因此体育活动的开展给生产带来很大好处。这个工厂几年来每月都超额完成生产计划，很多工人既是体育积极分子，又是先进生产者。去年全厂八百多名职工出勤率达到95％以上，今年第一季度出勤率又上升到96％多，而八十八名体育代表队队员出勤率高达99.44％，其中有三十七人是先进生产者。
    第三个经验是：先普及后提高，正确地解决普及与提高的关系。解放前这个厂的工人劳动条件非常坏，80％多的工人都有职业病。解放后虽然改善了劳动条件，但多少年来给工人留下的职业病并没有根除，工人们的身体一般都不好，对生产影响很大。从1951年工厂开始推行广播体操起，就找到了改变这种局面的“法宝”——普及体育活动。但是一开始普及就遇到了困难：这个厂的特点是职工平均年龄有四十岁，青工只占13％多，一百三十多名女工除了六个人以外，都有孩子。在这种情况下，他们就想办法开展多种多样的体育活动，以适应不同年龄、不同喜好的要求。例如在女工中提倡跳绳、踢毽子、抖空竹、短跑等。在老年工人中，最受欢迎的太极拳、打花棍等也活跃起来。搬运工人喜欢摔跤，就请了有十八年经验的老工人胡景山当教练，组织起摔跤队。青壮年职工喜好比较多，体育协会就在他们中间推广劳卫制，特别是长跑、单双杠、跳箱和各种球类活动，吸引了越来越多的人参加。在普及的基础上又不断提高运动技术，组织多种多样的竞赛、运动会、体育晚会，在不同的季节里，组织不同项目的活动，同时还参加市、区级运动会，进一步鼓舞了群众参加体育活动的热情。现在，全厂职工有95％以上参加广播体操，组织了十七个运动队，体协会员发展到三百五十多人，已经有九十六人达到了劳卫制或等级运动员标准。现在，工厂已经做到“天天有活动、周周有比赛”。
    第四个经验是：走群众路线，发动和依靠群众解决开展体育活动中的困难问题。开展体育活动首先碰到的是场地和器材问题，这些问题都是依靠职工群众自己的力量解决的。摔跤场、篮球场都是发动群众自己修建的；双杠和排球柱是木工们制作的；羽毛球架是由钳工、电焊工和油漆工用三个中午休息时间突击出来的。
