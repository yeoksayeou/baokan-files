　　Small Data

　　Fruits of Voluntary Labor

　　One-third of the Ming Tombs Reservoir Project Completed
　　The Ming Tombs Reservoir project started in mid-February this year, and by May 14, 37% of the planned engineering progress had been completed. Currently, 100,000 people are performing voluntary labor here every day.
　　The reservoir's drainage area reaches 217 square kilometers, with a water storage capacity of 66 million cubic meters. Once completed, it can irrigate more than 250,000 mu of land, increasing grain production by 40 to 50 million jin per year. During the two-month irrigation season, it can generate 2.16 million kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, and produce more than 900,000 jin of fish annually.
　　After the reservoir is completed, it can also regulate the climate and rainfall of the capital, making the Ming Tombs a beautiful park with green hills and clear waters.

　　More Than Ten Artificial Lakes Dug
　　In the past two months or so, more than ten artificial lakes have been dug or are being dug in the Guans廂 area of urban Beijing through voluntary labor. Among them, the larger ones include the Dongfeng Lake outside Jianguomen, the Workers' Lake in Chaoyangmen, the Shizipo Lake outside Dongzhimen, the Rending Lake outside Andingmen, the Taiping Lake outside Xizhimen, the Youth Lake outside Guang'anmen, and the Kangjia Garden Lake and Panjiayao Lake outside Zuo'anmen. After these artificial lakes are dug, the total area will be more than 900,000 square meters, equivalent to the lake surface of two Beihai Parks. It can not only solve the flood discharge problem in some areas of the city, but also irrigate more than 5,000 mu of fields with the rainwater it stores, producing more than 700,000 jin of fish. The open space around the lake will be fully greened.

　　More Than 59 Million Trees Planted
　　Since the beginning of spring this year, more than 1,416,000 person-times in Beijing have participated in voluntary tree planting and afforestation, planting more than 59 million trees of various types (a small portion of which were planted by farmers themselves), exceeding more than ten times the total number of trees planted in the city last year. In addition, forests have been created in many mountainous areas.

　　义务劳动的果实
　　十三陵水库工程完成三分之一
    十三陵水库工程是今年2月中旬开工的，到5月14日，已经完成工程进度计划的37％。现在，每天有十万人在这里进行义务劳动。
    这个水库流域面积达二百一十七平方公里，蓄水六千六百万公方，修成后可以灌溉二十五万亩以上的土地，每年可以增产四、五千万斤粮食；每年在两个月的灌溉季节中能发电二百一十六万度；每年可产鱼九十多万斤。
    水库修成后，还可以调节首都的气候、雨量，使十三陵成为青山绿水的美丽公园。
    挖掘十多个人工湖
    两个多月来，在北京城区关厢已经用义务劳动挖了或正在挖着十多个人工湖，其中规模较大的有建国门外的东风湖，朝阳门的工人湖，东直门外的十字坡湖，安定门外的人定湖，西直门外的太平湖，广安门外的青年湖，左安门外的康家园湖和潘家窑湖等。这些人工湖挖成后，总面积有九十多万平方公尺，等于两个北海公园的湖面。它不仅可以解决城内部分地区的排洪问题，它注蓄的雨水还可灌溉五千多亩田地，产鱼七十多万斤。湖周围的空地将全部绿化。
    植树五千九百多万棵
    今年入春以来，北京参加植树造林义务劳动的有一百四十一万六千多人次，栽种各种树木五千九百多万棵（其中有一小部分是农民自己种的），超过去年全市植树总数的十倍以上，另外还在很多山地造了林。
