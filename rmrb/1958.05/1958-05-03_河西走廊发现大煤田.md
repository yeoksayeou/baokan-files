    Large Coalfield Discovered in the Hexi Corridor
    (Our newspaper reports) The Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Team 145 has discovered a large coalfield in the Hexi Corridor. Based on information provided by the masses, all the staff of this team found a substantial reserve of coking coal in Yanghugou, which can be used to build two pairs of mine shafts with an annual output of 300,000 tons in the future.
    The transportation to this coalfield is very convenient, with the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway passing through the center of the mining area. According to the on-site reconnaissance of the technical负责人 (fùzé rén, person in charge) of Team 145, the coalfield area is estimated to be 300 square kilometers. Based on the extension of the strata, it can be confirmed that the mining area is 35 kilometers long and 5 kilometers wide. The total thickness of the coal seam is 5.7 meters. Furthermore, the geological structure of this area is relatively simple.
    Team 145 started ground work in April and began drilling exploration in August.

    河西走廊发现大煤田
    本报讯　西北煤田地质勘探局一四五队在河西走廊发现大煤田。这个队的全体职工根据群众报矿意见，在羊虎沟找到了储量相当大的炼焦用煤，将来可建两对年产三十万吨的矿井。
    这个煤田的交通非常方便，兰新公路就从井田中央穿过。根据一四五队技术负责人现场踏勘推测，这个煤田面积有三百平方公里，根据地层延展情况可以肯定井田长三十五公里，宽五公里。煤层总厚度为五点七公尺。并且这个地区的地质构造比较简单。
    一四五队从4月份开始做地面工作，从8月份开始打钻勘探。
