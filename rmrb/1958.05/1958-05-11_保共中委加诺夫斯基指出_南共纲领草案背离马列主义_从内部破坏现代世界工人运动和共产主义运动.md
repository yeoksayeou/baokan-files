Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 10th. At a meeting in Sofia commemorating the 140th anniversary of Marx's birth on May 6th, Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee member and Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Vice President Academician Ganovski delivered a report analyzing and criticizing modern revisionism and the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Ganovski spoke about the offensive of imperialist reactionary forces against Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that now, when the people of socialist countries are practically applying the theories of Marx and Lenin, and when socialist ideas are winning thousands upon thousands of new and ardent believers in capitalist countries, revisionism is also spreading and running rampant under the influence of bourgeois ideology and politics. Ganovski said that today, various schools of revisionism are the links that bring imperialist ideas into the workers' movement. In the past, revisionism attempted to revise the ideas of scientific socialism; modern revisionism not only wants to discredit the theory of scientific socialism, but also attempts to undermine the practice of international socialism—the great cause of socialist construction. Revisionists mainly slander the Soviet Union and weaken the Soviet Union's attraction to the working people of the world. They abandon the solidarity of socialist countries.

Speaking of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Ganovski said, "If we look at some of the principles in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, for example, a failure to understand the historical significance and role of the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in the path of human development; denial of the positive and leading role of the Soviet Union in the current international situation; insufficient assessment of the rich and multifaceted experience of the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in socialist construction, as well as non-recognition of the leading role of the CPSU in its relations with other communist and workers' parties; insufficient assessment of the necessity of solidarity and cooperation between socialist countries and communist parties around the world; an incorrect understanding of the significance of the general laws of the transition from capitalism to socialism and the role of the Communist Party in socialist construction; a failure to understand the class nature of bourgeois states and bourgeois democracy; a failure to understand the role of the proletarian state and the position and role of the dictatorship of the proletariat; a failure to consider the distinction between bourgeois democracy and socialist democracy; a failure to understand the contradictions between the socialist and capitalist systems, and so on. After reading all this, it is very clear that, on these major issues of principle, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has not made essential distinctions, and in some places is completely filled with the views held by revisionists. These erroneous and harmful views deviate from Marxism-Leninism, are detrimental to the workers' movement and the communist movement led by the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and these views sabotage the ideological front of the modern world workers' movement and the communist movement from within."

In conclusion, Ganovski pointed out in his report that commemorating the 140th anniversary of the birth of the great Marx requires tirelessly fighting against any kind of revisionism and opportunism, and struggling for the realization of socialist and communist ideals throughout the world.

　　保共中委加诺夫斯基指出南共纲领草案背离马列主义　
    从内部破坏现代世界工人运动和共产主义运动
    据新华社索非亚电　保加利亚共产党中央委员会委员、保加利亚科学院副院长加诺夫斯基院士6日在索非亚的马克思诞辰一百四十周年纪念会上作报告时对现代修正主义和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案作了分析批判。
    加诺夫斯基谈到帝国主义反动势力向马克思列宁主义的进攻。他指出，现在，当社会主义国家人民正在实际运用马克思和列宁的学说的时候，当社会主义思想在资本主义国家赢得千千万万新的热烈的信仰者的时候，修正主义也在资产阶级思想和政治影响下蔓延和猖狂起来了。加诺夫斯基说，今天各种修正主义的流派是把帝国主义思想带到工人运动中来的纽带。从前修正主义企图修改科学社会主义的思想，现代的修正主义不仅想要诋毁科学社会主义理论，而且也企图破坏国际社会主义的实践——社会主义建设的伟大事业。修正主义者主要是诽谤苏联和削弱苏联对世界劳动人民的吸引力量。他们抛弃了社会主义国家的团结。
    加诺夫斯基在谈到南共纲领草案时说，如果我们看一看南共纲领草案中的一些原则，例如，不了解在人类发展道路上开辟了新纪元的伟大的十月社会主义革命的历史意义和作用；否认苏联在当前国际局势下的积极作用和领导作用；对苏联和苏联共产党在社会主义建设中的丰富和多方面的经验估计不足以及不承认苏共在同其他共产党和工人党的关系中的领导作用；对全世界社会主义国家和共产党之间的团结合作的必要性估计不足；不正确地理解从资本主义向社会主义过渡的普遍规律的意义和共产党在社会主义建设中的作用；不了解资产阶级国家和资产阶级民主的阶级性；不了解无产阶级国家的作用和无产阶级专政的地位和作用；不考虑资产阶级民主和社会主义民主之间的区别；不了解社会主义和资本主义两种制度之间的矛盾等等。在看完这一切之后，我们就很清楚，在这些重大原则性问题上，南共没有从本质上加以辨别，而在某些地方却完全充满了修正主义者所拥有的那些观点。这些错误和有害的观点背离了马克思列宁主义，不利于以苏联和苏共为首的工人运动和共产主义运动，这些观点从内部破坏现代世界工人运动和共产主义运动的思想阵地。
    加诺夫斯基在报告中最后指出，纪念伟大的马克思一百四十周年诞辰，要不倦地同任何种类的修正主义和机会主义进行斗争，为在全世界实现社会主义和共产主义思想而斗争。
