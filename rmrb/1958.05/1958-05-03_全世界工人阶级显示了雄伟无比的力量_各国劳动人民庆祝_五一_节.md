    The working people of Asian countries also held gatherings on May 1st to celebrate May Day.

    More than five million working people in Japan held rallies and demonstrations in more than 580 cities across the country. In Tokyo, more than 600,000 workers participated in the central celebration meeting held in the outer gardens of Meiji Shrine. After Iwai Akira, Secretary-General of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, announced the opening of the meeting, Suzuki Mosaburo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, Nosaka Sanzo, First Secretary of the Communist Party, Shimosaka Masahide, representative of the All-Japan Farmers Association Federation, Arida Hachiro, representative of the National Federation to Uphold the Constitution, and others spoke successively. They unanimously called on workers to unite more closely and crush the reactionary policies implemented by the Kishi Nobusuke government. Down with the Kishi Nobusuke reactionary government! The resolution passed at the meeting stated that the Japanese working class will unite and concentrate its efforts to overthrow the Kishi Nobusuke government in the general election struggle, which has consistently pursued reactionary and traitorous policies that ignore the wishes and interests of the Japanese people. The resolution also called for the immediate and unconditional prohibition of nuclear weapons, disarmament to ease international tensions, and the realization of world peace. The meeting also passed resolutions on improving workers' working conditions, guaranteeing workers' basic rights, and establishing a social insurance system. After the meeting, the participating masses divided into five teams and held a massive demonstration.

    In New Delhi, the capital of India, the working people held a rally in Gandhi Square on the evening of that day.

    Western European Countries
    On May Day, the working people of Western European countries held grand parades and mass rallies to commemorate their holiday.

Social Democrats, Communists, and Christians in the working-class ranks marched side by side under the red flag. Their main slogans were: "Against atomic death!" "Hold a general strike!" "Hold a referendum!"

    Hundreds of thousands of Parisians gathered in the suburbs of Paris to celebrate International Labor Day. Because the authorities forbade the working people from holding a May Day parade, the Paris Union Federation of the French General Confederation of Labor organized a mass rally in front of the employment agency. Tens of thousands of workers and employees, youth representatives, and representatives from various factories and student organizations in Paris crowded the streets near the venue, shouting slogans: "Restore peace in Algeria!" "Don't let fascism raise its head!" "Down with rocket installations!" The French "Republican Guard" and police gathered near the venue to monitor the masses. Mass rallies and labor demonstrations were also held in Marseille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Strasbourg, Lille, and other major French cities, demanding an immediate end to the Algerian War, the defense of Republican freedoms, and opposition to rising living costs.

    The working people of the British capital celebrated their holiday - International Labor Day - in the struggle against the persecution and sabotage activities of the police and fascists. At noon on this day, mounted police violently dispersed a May Day demonstration in the St. Pancras district of London and arrested many peaceful demonstrators, including John Lawrence, a member of the St. Pancras Municipal Council and Labor leader of the Municipal Committee. The crowd, angered by the police brutality, shouted "Fascists." Workers regrouped and sang "The Red Flag," at which point reinforcements surrounded them again, grabbed some of the singers by the neck, dragged them away, and threw them into police vans.

    Regardless of police obstruction and persecution, the workers gathered again in the evening under the fluttering red flag and continued the rally that had been disrupted at noon.

    In Rome, thousands of working people held a May Day celebration in the city center.
