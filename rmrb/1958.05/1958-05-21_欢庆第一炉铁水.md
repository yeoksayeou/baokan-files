Celebrating the First Furnace of Molten Iron

The entire staff of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works in Songrim, on the west coast of Korea, recently celebrated the commissioning of the ironworks' No. 1 blast furnace and another coke oven. All of their equipment was manufactured by the Korean people themselves.

The No. 1 blast furnace of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works was riddled with holes during the war and had not produced iron for eight years. However, the Korean workers, with selfless hard work, restored it in just over a year. This is the best gift from the Korean workers for the "May Day" holiday.

The Huanghai Iron and Steel Works is a combined iron and steel enterprise in Korea. It was bombed many times by the enemy during the war, and more than 75% of its equipment was destroyed. After the war, the Korean workers gradually restored the entire project from the ruins with their own hands. In 1957, the production of steel and steel products in this enterprise had exceeded the highest level before liberation.

After the No. 1 blast furnace of the Huanghai Iron and Steel Works is put into production, the factory will become a complete metallurgical factory. It can produce both ingots and steel, and milled iron. The daily output of the No. 1 blast furnace will increase from 250 to 280 tons during the Japanese rule to 600 to 700 tons, and the annual output of the coke oven put into production at the same time as the No. 1 blast furnace will also reach 300,000 tons.

This year, the workers of this iron and steel works will use the spirit of the Great Leap Forward to increase the output of steel and steel products by 70% compared with last year. After restoring the No. 1 blast furnace, they will continue the restoration of the No. 2 blast furnace, so that it can be put into production in 1960. (Fei) (with picture)

    欢庆第一炉铁水
    朝鲜西海岸松林市黄海制铁所的全体职工们，不久前欢庆这个制铁所的第一号高炉以及另一座炼焦炉投入生产。它们的全部设备都是朝鲜人民自己制造的。
    黄海制铁所的第一号高炉，在战时曾被破坏得千疮百孔，八年来没有出过铁。但是，朝鲜的工人们以忘我的辛勤劳动，经过一年多一点的时间，把它修复了。这是朝鲜工人对“五一”节的最好的献礼。
    黄海制铁所是朝鲜的一个联合钢铁企业。战时曾遭到敌人多次轰炸，75％以上的设备受到了破坏。战后，朝鲜工人们用自己的双手从废墟上逐步恢复了全部工程。1957年，这个企业的钢和钢材的生产量已超过了解放前的最高水平。
    黄海制铁所的第一号高炉投入生产后，这个厂就成为一座完备的冶金工厂。它既能生产钢锭和钢材，也能生产铣铁。第一号高炉的日产量，将由日本统治时期的二百五十到二百八十吨提高到六百到七百吨，和第一号高炉同时投入生产的炼焦炉的年产量也将达三十万吨。
    今年，这个制铁所的工人们将要以跃进的精神，把钢和钢材的产量比去年提高70％。他们在恢复了第一号高炉以后，将继续进行第二号高炉的恢复工作，使它在1960年投入生产。　（芾）（附图片）
