     A Year Ago, Taiwan People's Anti-American Patriotic Demonstration
    On May 24, 1957, the people of Taiwan broke out in an anti-American patriotic demonstration. On this day, tens of thousands of Taipei citizens attacked and destroyed the American "Embassy," stormed into the United States Information Service, and burned and smashed many facilities used for cultural aggression and deceptive propaganda. They surrounded the American Military Assistance Advisory Group headquarters and the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command, whose iron gates were tightly locked, and burned American military vehicles parked in front of the gates. At the same time, tens of thousands of unarmed people surrounded the Taipei City Police Department of the Chiang Kai-shek Group, demanding the release of patriots arrested for participating in the demonstration.
    The news of the anti-American patriotic demonstration in Taipei quickly shocked the entire island of Taiwan. Everywhere in Taiwan, slogans such as "Drive out the American aggressors!" "Severely punish the American murderers!" "Yankee go home!" appeared, expressing the hatred of the nine million people of Taiwan for the American imperialists' occupation of Taiwan.
    The surging anti-American demonstration of the people of Taiwan caused great panic among the American aggressors and the Chiang Kai-shek Group. Under American instructions, the Chiang Kai-shek Group hurriedly dispatched three divisions of Chiang's troops into Taipei to carry out a bloody suppression of the citizens of Taipei. Under the suppression of the Chiang Kai-shek Group's army, police, and military police, more than thirty citizens participating in the demonstration were killed or injured, and more than two hundred were arrested. The Chiang Kai-shek Group also declared a state of emergency throughout Taiwan, prohibiting residents from holding anti-American patriotic gatherings and petitions.
    This large-scale demonstration by the people of Taiwan concentratedly demonstrated their deep-seated hatred for the American occupiers and their strong desire for Taiwan to return to the embrace of the motherland. As for the United States abusing extraterritorial rights in Taiwan and declaring the American soldier Reynolds, who killed the Chinese Liu Ziran, "not guilty," it was the fuse for the outbreak of this demonstration.

### 一年前台湾人民的反美爱国大示威

     一年前台湾人民的反美爱国大示威
    1957年5月24日，台湾人民爆发了反美爱国大示威。这一天，台北市几万市民攻打和捣毁了美国“大使馆”，冲进美国新闻处，把许多进行文化侵略和欺骗宣传的设备烧毁和打烂，包围了铁门紧锁的美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部和美国台湾防御司令部，把门前停放的美军车辆烧毁。同时，几万赤手空拳的群众，包围了蒋介石集团台北市警察总局，要求释放参加示威被捕的爱国者。
    台北市爆发反美爱国大示威的消息，迅速轰动整个台湾。台湾各地都出现“赶走美国侵略者！”“严惩美国杀人犯！”“美国鬼子滚出去！”等标语和口号，表达了九百万台湾人民对美帝国主义者霸占台湾的痛恨。
    台湾人民汹涌澎湃的反美大示威行动，引起了美国侵略者和蒋介石集团很大的惊慌。在美国的指令下，蒋介石集团急忙抽调三个师的蒋军开进台北市区，对台北市民进行血腥镇压。在蒋介石集团军队、警察、宪兵的镇压下，参加示威的市民三十多人伤亡、二百多人被捕。蒋介石集团还在全台湾各地宣布紧急戒严，禁止各地居民举行反美爱国的集会请愿。
    台湾人民这次爆发的大示威，集中地表现了他们对美国占领者仇恨入骨，要求台湾重新回到祖国怀抱的强烈意志。至于美国在台湾滥用治外法权，把行凶杀死中国人刘自然的美军士兵雷诺宣告“无罪释放”，则是爆发这次大示威的导火线。
