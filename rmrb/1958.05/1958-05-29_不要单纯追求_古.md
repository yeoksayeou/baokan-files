    Don't Simply Pursue "Antiquity"
    In recent years, the Beijing Ancient Books Publishing House has collated and published many classical literary works. At the same time, it has also reprinted some woodcut-printed thread-bound books from the Ming or Qing Dynasties, or photo-reproduced rare Song Dynasty editions. However, this work has also seen a phenomenon of valuing the ancient and belittling the modern.
    The "Collected Commentaries on the Book of Poetry" published by the publishing house in 1955 used very large woodcut characters, with only one hundred and fifty characters printed per page. The entire book had one thousand and eighteen pages. If typeset with size five lead type, at least six hundred characters could be printed per page, and the entire book would only require two hundred and fifty pages. Moreover, the price could be reduced from the original 5.50 yuan to 1.50 yuan, saving paper and reducing the burden on readers. However, the publishing house simply pursued "antiquity" and reproduced the original version without any changes, wasting financial and material resources.
    In addition, many of the classical works published recently do not have punctuation marks, causing difficulties for readers. The ancients did not use punctuation marks, but can't today's editors add them?

### 不要单纯追求“古”

    不要单纯追求“古”
    几年来，北京古籍刊行社整理和出版了许多古典文学作品，同时，也翻印了一些明代或清代的木刻本线装书，或影印宋版珍本。但就在这个工作上，也出现了厚古薄今的现象。
    1955年该社出版的“诗集传”，木刻字很大，每页只能印一百五十个字，全书共有一千零十八页，如用五号铅字排，每页至少能印六百字，全书只需二百五十页，而且售价可由原来的五元五角降到一元五角，既节约了纸张，又减轻了读者的负担，但是出版社却单纯为了追求“古”，就原封不动的搬来翻版，浪费了财力和物力。
    此外，近来刊行的古典作品，很多不加标点符号，造成读者阅读时的困难，古人不会运用标点符号，难道今天的编者还不能给加上吗？
