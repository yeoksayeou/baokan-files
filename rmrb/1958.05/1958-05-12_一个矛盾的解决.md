　　A Contradiction Resolved
  　Tian Lianqian
    An important aspect of contradictions among the people in our country is the grain issue. For centuries, the peasant masses have been striving for "a full stomach," but all past reactionary governments only knew how to plunder the people. Therefore, the people have never trusted the government. The peasant masses support the Communist Party and the People's Government with both hands because they led the people to eliminate class enemies such as landlords and despots, eliminate the system of exploitation, and devised many ways to develop agricultural production and improve the lives of peasants. However, the old relationship between the people and the government in the old era, the phenomenon of the people lacking full trust in the government, as Lenin said, cannot be completely eliminated quickly. This requires much time and education through ideological facts to thoroughly resolve.
    In the grain issue, this situation is particularly evident. According to the grain yield, reserves, and the general state of grain consumption by the masses, this region should not be short of grain. However, every spring, we hear cries of grain shortage everywhere. Due to various specific reasons, there may be some farm households that are short of grain, but there shouldn't be so many. But it is really difficult to distinguish who is truly short and who is pretending. Supplying everyone would deplete the state's grain reserves. Not supplying anyone would leave a few farm households unable to survive. This problem has not been completely resolved to this day.
    The mass movement of "Every Household Stores Glorious Grain" in Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, has set an example for the thorough resolution of this problem, opened up a path, and initially realized the direction indicated by the Agricultural Development Program. Thoroughly relying on the consciousness of the masses, entrusting the Party and the state's grain policy to the masses, explaining the principles clearly, and implementing the spirit and specific practices of this policy among the broad masses through mass debates, enabling the masses to understand the policy through facts. The result of Qingyuan County's approach proves that the vast majority of farm households have enough grain or even a surplus. Even if a few farm households have some difficulties, the masses can automatically adjust and solve them. The hidden grain buried underground for many years, the masses are also willing to automatically dig out and turn into visible grain. As a result, the biggest difficulty for state organs in grain supply work is eliminated, and an important contradiction among the people is resolved: ensuring that truly grain-deficient farm households receive supplies, while ensuring that grain is not wasted and supply targets are not exceeded, thereby effectively maintaining the stability of the grain situation. The artificial tension is gone, and the "landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements" have no opportunity to make trouble.
    Originally, from the perspective of the vast majority of peasants, they are not willing to turn visible grain into hidden grain, and keep grain secrets from their own country. However, when the leadership has not actively advocated grain storage and has not explained the grain policy very clearly, the peasants will have some concerns. This is the reason why the artificial grain tension in the past has not been completely eliminated. Now that the leadership has adopted the correct working methods, the contradiction is immediately resolved. This shows that within our country and among our people, because there is no relationship of exploitation and being exploited, there are no irresolvable contradictions like those within capitalist countries. As long as the leadership can use the method of reasoning as Chairman Mao said, fully mobilize the masses and rely on the consciousness of the masses, we will have no difficulties that cannot be overcome.

　　一个矛盾的解决
  　田连阡
    我国人民内部矛盾中的一个重要方面，是粮食问题。农民群众多少世纪以来一直是在为“饱腹”而奋斗，但历来的反动政府只会掠夺人民。所以人民对政府从来是不信任的。对于共产党和人民政府，农民群众举双手拥护，因为它领导人民消灭了地主恶霸等阶级敌人，消灭了剥削制度，还想了许多办法来发展农业生产，改善农民生活。但是，旧时代人民和政府的旧关系，人民对政府缺乏充分信任的现象，如像列宁所说，并不是很快可以完全消除的。这要经过许多的时间和思想的事实的教育，才能彻底解决。
    在粮食问题上，这种情形表现得特别明显。按照粮食的产量、留量和群众食用粮食的一般状况，这个地区是不应当缺粮的。可是一到春季，就到处听到嚷嚷缺粮的声音。由于各种具体的原因，缺粮的农户是会有一些的，但不该有这么多。可是又实在很难辨别谁真缺，谁假缺。通通供应，国家粮食不够。通通不供应，就真有少数农户过不了日子。这一问题至今还没有得到彻底解决。
    河北清苑县“户户储备光荣粮”的群众运动，为这一问题的彻底解决树立了榜样，开辟了途径，初步实现了农业发展纲要所指明方向。彻底依靠群众的自觉，把党和国家的粮食政策交给群众，讲清道理，经过群众性的辩论，把这一政策的精神和具体做法贯彻到广大群众中去，使群众通过事实来认识政策。清苑县这样做的结果，证明绝大多数农户的粮食是够用甚至有余的。就是少数农户有点困难，群众也能自动调剂解决。埋在地下多少年的暗粮，群众也愿意自动挖出来变成了明粮。这一来，国家机关在粮食供应工作上一个最大的困难扫除了，人民内部一个重要的矛盾解决了：既保证了真正缺粮的农户得到供应，又保证了不浪费粮食，不突破供应指标，因而能够切实保持粮食局势的稳定。人为的紧张没有了，“地富反坏”想要捣乱也无隙可乘了。
    本来，从绝大多数农民说，他们并不愿意把明粮变成暗粮，对自己的国家保守粮食秘密。可是，在领导上没有积极倡导储粮，没有把粮食政策交代得十分清楚的时候，农民是会有某些忧虑的。这就是过去人为的粮食紧张一直没有彻底扫除的原因。现在领导上采取了正确的工作方法，矛盾马上就解决了。这就说明，在我们国家和人民的内部，因为不是剥削与被剥削的关系，根本没有像资本主义国家内部那种不能解决的矛盾。只要领导上能够像毛主席所说的那样用说道理的方法，充分发动群众和依靠群众的自觉，我们就没有任何困难是克服不了的。
