    Lu Xun is a Great Example of Valuing the Present and Belittling the Past
    Chen Mingshu
    I
    Lu Xun is a great example of valuing the present and belittling the past. As a warrior, he was always committed to the struggle in reality, unreservedly subordinating his work to the needs of the revolution.
    Valuing the present and belittling the past is essentially a revolutionary idea. All historical figures who played a progressive role always held this idea at the time. As early as 1907, Lu Xun expressed this idea in his essay "On the Power of Mara Poetry." He told us that "reminiscing about the past" must be "like a bright mirror," and we should "constantly advance on the long road of light, constantly remember the brilliant past," so that "the new will be renewed daily, and the old will not die." This means that history should be regarded as a mirror, using the past to serve the present and bringing forth the new from the old. Later, Lu Xun repeatedly expressed this idea, believing that although ancient culture "benefits future generations in many ways, it also restricts them." Therefore, we must "not only be the preservers of literary heritage, but also the pioneers and builders." ("Supplements to Collected Works," Postscript to "Jade-Attracting Collection")
    As everyone knows, Lu Xun wrote novels not to enter the "palace of art," but to "improve life," exposing the suffering of the people at that time to draw attention to remedies. However, as the revolution gradually deepened and "the rapid and intense social struggle made it impossible for writers to calmly melt their thoughts and emotions into their creations" (Qu Qiubai), Lu Xun resolutely put down the creation of novels and created a weapon for close combat with the enemy—the miscellaneous essay. This was "despised" by some literati and scholars who valued the past and belittled the present, emphasized the foreign and slighted the Chinese. Some lamented Lu Xun; some ridiculed Lu Xun for failing to become an artist. "Why can Russia produce great works like 'War and Peace'? ...And our writers, will they forever write miscellaneous essays and take it as a great satisfaction?" ("Supplements to Complete Works of Lu Xun": "It's Not Easy to Write Miscellaneous Essays Either"). The enemy gave Lu Xun a derogatory epithet: "Miscellaneous Essay Expert." The "expert" in "miscellaneous" clearly contained contempt. But Lu Xun ignored the buzzing of these flies and mosquitoes. He believed that "when it is time to do such things, I am afraid that I will still do such things. I think if there are such troublesome prohibitions in the palace of art, it is better not to enter; it is better to stand on the desert, look at the flying sand and stones, laugh loudly when happy, shout loudly when sad, and curse angrily when angry. Even if the gravel beats all over my body, making it rough and bloody, and I often caress my congealed blood, feeling that there are patterns, it may not be less interesting than following the Chinese literati to accompany Shakespeare to eat buttered bread." (Preface to "Bad Luck") Lu Xun's commitment to the struggle in reality was not only fundamentally incomprehensible to the literati who regarded writing as an investment to obtain a generous interest, but even comrades in the same camp could not all understand the significance of his miscellaneous essay battle. Lu Xun said: "Some people also advise me not to write such short comments. I am very grateful for that kindness, and I am not unaware of the value of creation." But, "Now is such an urgent time, the author's task is to immediately give a response or resistance to harmful things... It is certainly good to devote oneself to his magnum opus and envision the future of culture, but fighting for the present is also precisely for the present and future fighting authors, because without the present, there is no future." ("Qie Jie Ting Miscellaneous Essays": Preface) In this way, Lu Xun devoted most of his time and energy in the second half of his life to the art of battle—the miscellaneous essay—which was closely integrated with the needs of the revolution. Even until his death, his planned history of Chinese literature and the full-length novel describing the life of the Tang Dynasty palace were not realized. This is naturally a loss in literary history, but as a warrior, in the revolutionary stormy period, he expressed the voices of millions of people and completed his lofty historical mission, which not only compensated for his loss in literary history, but also erected an immortal monument for him in literary history. Now who remembers the scholars who "yearned for the Tang and Yu dynasties," "returned to the Yuan dynasty," and were determined to research that "Liu Xin was not Liu Xiang's son," and the writers who "devoted themselves to his magnum opus" and envisioned the culture of ten thousand years later? Only the achievements of those who are committed to the struggle in reality will last with history.

    II
    Valuing the present and belittling the past versus valuing the past and belittling the present marks the two worldviews of individualism and collectivism, and has always been the struggle between the two lines of revolution and regression or reaction. Starting from a revolutionary standpoint, Lu Xun criticized all the old antiques who restored the old, loved the old, thought about the old, and missed the old. Some skeleton enthusiasts "focus their minds on the distant Tang and Yu dynasties, or go directly into the ancient times, and wander in the world where humans and animals live together, saying that at that time, all disasters did not occur, and people lived in peace, which is not as bad and dangerous as this world, and there is no way to live." This is also like the right-wingers' "the present is not as good as the past" theory. Lu Xun believed that, in fact, "things are exactly the opposite." The "proliferation and migration, struggle and hard work" of the ancient people, even if not more severe than today, would certainly not be less than today. Because history was not recorded at that time, so now, when we think about it, we feel that it was very peaceful at that time. If we really put ourselves in that time and "share the worries of the ancient people, then we would be decadent and distant, and think about the world before Pan Gu was born, before the axe was used." ("On the Power of Mara Poetry") It can be seen that restoring the old will never be satisfied. Therefore, when the "self-proclaimed ancient civilized people" Lin Shu, Yan Fu, Zhang Shizhao, and others raised the banner of preserving national essence, Lu Xun gave a severe blow. He believed that it was not we who preserve the national essence first, but the national essence that preserves us. Preserving the national essence and preserving us are the fundamental differences between the two ideas of restoration and revolution. I feel that this question has not lost its practical significance today. Is it using the past to serve the present, or are today's people slaves of the ancients? Some senior intellectuals have not clearly resolved this issue in their actual work. Classical cultural heritage is not an antique in a museum, only for us to put it aside for appreciation, or frequently nod and praise it, or even lose our aspirations by playing with it. Thirty years ago, Lu Xun's answer to this question was clear: "If there is anything that hinders this future, whether it is ancient or modern, human or ghost, whether it is 'Three Tombs' 'Five Classics,' hundreds of Song dynasties and thousands of Yuan dynasties, celestial spheres and river maps, golden men and jade Buddhas, ancestral pills and powders, secret ointments and elixirs, all trample them down." ("Bad Luck": "Suddenly Thought Of" 6) Only by breaking superstitions can we use the past to serve the present. It seems that reviewing this passage of Lu Xun is not superfluous. Some people drill into the pile of old papers and can never get out again. This is just like Lu Xun telling us that the study of a Ming Dynasty remnant was called "Living Burial Temple," burying himself alive inside. But "Lin Hui returned the thousand-gold jade and carried the infant and ran," weighing the gains and losses, looking more forward, and he can still make choices. Otherwise, he will have to be really buried alive inside. What is the benefit of being buried with the ancients? For example, Liu Bannong, in the May Fourth era, was also a warrior, "but later he only wrote limericks and played with rotten ancient prose." Based on different positions, Lu Xun openly expressed his disgust:
    "I love Bannong ten years ago, and I hate him in recent years. This hatred is the hatred of a friend, because I hope he is always Bannong ten years ago. His being a warrior, even if 'shallow,' is more beneficial to China." ("Qie Jie Ting Miscellaneous Essays": "Remembering Mr. Liu Bannong")

    III
    Just as a person cannot "do art for art's sake," it is impossible to restore the old for the sake of restoring the old. At that time, Lu Xun had clearly seen that the so-called restoring the old, loving the old, thinking about the old, and missing the old are just a guise. Behind it, there is hidden hostility to the revolution, dissatisfaction with reality, and the pursuit of personal ulterior motives...
    It is said that a right-wing element who has always despised Chinese classical literature has recently been chanting Li Taibai with a book in hand. Of course, he does not want to write "On Li Taibai," or study whether Li Taibai's poetry is dominated by romanticism or realism. He is enthusiastic about such sentences:
    "Drawing a knife to cut off water, the water flows more, raising a glass to dispel sorrow, the sorrow is more; life in the world is not satisfactory, tomorrow I will let my hair down and go boating."
    "Life should be merry while one is able, let not the golden cup face the moon alone."
    These "people who hate the present world," in Lu Xun's words, "are all enemies who hate the present world." What should we do with them? Still using Lu Xun's words:
     "Those who admire the past, go back to the past! Those who want to be born, be born soon! Those who want to go to heaven, go to heaven soon! Souls who want to leave the body, leave quickly! The present earth should be inhabited by people who are committed to the present and committed to the earth." ("Bad Luck": "Miscellaneous Feelings") Although this passage of Lu Xun was said to the remnants of the old era after the Xinhai Revolution, it is not out of date to give it to a small number of remnants of feudalism and capitalism.

    IV
    "Valuing the ancient and despising the present, neglecting the near and seeking the far" are certainly not all "enemies of the present world," but they are not particularly fond of "eating scabs," and it is really difficult to get rid of accumulated habits. Some people are not really expressing any "nostalgia for the past," nor are they very willing to "only read books from the Three Dynasties and the Two Han Dynasties." They just hope to attach themselves to the tail of the ancient people to become glorious, so that "their reputation will be passed on to future generations." The so-called "a gentleman is worried that his name will not be praised after his death." In fact, the result of wanting immortality is often quick death. For example, Lu Xun's miscellaneous essays, at that time, some people advised him not to do it, because doing it would not be famous in the future world history. I think the gentleman who advised Lu Xun not to write miscellaneous essays must be able to see his great name in world history now, but he has never been seen. Because "American 'Introduction to Literature' or the lectures of some universities in China (referring to that time - translator's note), indeed, cannot find something called Tsa-Wen. This really makes young people who are ambitious to become great writers feel discouraged when they see miscellaneous essays. It turns out that this is not a ladder to climb into the noble literary building." Although, "Novels and operas have always been regarded as heretical by China, but once the Western 'Introduction to Literature' cited them as orthodox, we also regard them as treasures. ...The essay, which is a part of miscellaneous essays, is regarded as orthodox. Because someone said that it is close to the British Essay, some people also kowtow and dare not underestimate it." ("Qie Jie Ting Miscellaneous Essays II": "Xu Maoyong's 'Odd Job Collection' Preface") In this way, the existence of the blood relationship between valuing the ancient and despising the present and emphasizing the foreign and slighting the Chinese has been "a long time ago, not just a day." Some of our teachers always mention Shakespeare, some teachers only hold Qu Yuan, thinking that "the rest are not worth mentioning," and do not even read Lu Xun's works, "do not know there is Han, let alone Wei and Jin." Of course, they do not know what major works have been produced since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art. They believe that studying these has no academic value. The so-called "academic value" is also the "ladder to climb into the noble literary building" that Lu Xun said. However, you should always think that they have in-depth research on Shakespeare or Qu Yuan! Or have they written immortal research works? Not necessarily. The reason why they admire Shakespeare or Qu Yuan is only because they are "ancient." If they were born at the same time as Shakespeare or Qu Yuan, they would still be unworthy of mention. I remember the Seventh Master in Lu Xun's novel "Divorce." He rubbed the "ass plug" of the ancients on both sides of his nose again and again, and repeatedly praised the "mercury immersion" in this rotten stone. He did not feel that it was inelegant at all to rub the "ass plug" on the bridge of his nose, just because it was the ancients. But Lu Xun asked well: "Try to turn over 'The Scholars' or 'Biographies of Literary Figures,' is there a great scholar who regards old books as antiques?"

    V
    Some people think that saying that Lu Xun is an example of valuing the present and belittling the past is not convincing enough. Didn't Lu Xun also engage in old learning? Indeed, Lu Xun sorted out, collated, proofread, and compiled many ancient books, and also read many ancient books. However, in Lu Xun's place, ancient books did not become antiques for appreciation. On the contrary, as a weapon that he widely used, he used the past to satirize the present, used the past to learn from the present, and even used the past to punish the present, fatally attacking the enemy. For example, there is a "small miscellaneous feeling" in "And Already Collection":
    "Liu Bang removed the harshness and tyranny of Qin, 'and agreed with the elders on only three chapters of the law.' But later there were still exterminations, and the prohibition of carrying books was still the Qin law. The three chapters of the law are just one sentence."
    With a few strokes, he drew the ghost face of Chiang Kai-shek who betrayed the revolution. It can be said that Lu Xun completely used the past to serve the present. These examples are countless in Lu Xun's miscellaneous essays. Lu Xun's original and highly ideological novel "Old Tales Retold" is an excellent example of using the past to serve the present under the historical conditions at that time. Even when Lu Xun was sorting out some classical literary heritage, he always kept the present in mind. For example, in the "Preface to the Beiping Letter Paper Score," he said:
    "If the art of writing is about to change, then the way of letter paper will be exhausted; later authors will inevitably open up new paths and strive for new life; when they look at the old hometown, they should wait for a leisure day." (Supplements to Collected Works) Lu Xun told us such a story. A local tyrant bought a Zhou tripod back. The soil was mottled, ancient and fragrant. But he asked the coppersmith to wipe the soil and green copper clean. Of course, all the "elegant scholars" laughed when they heard it. Lu Xun said: "At that time, I couldn't help but be shocked and laughed, but then I became solemn, as if I had received a kind of enlightenment. This enlightenment is not a 'philosophical meaning,' but I felt that I had just seen the Zhou tripod close to the truth. The tripod in the Zhou Dynasty was just like the bowl in modern times. There is no reason why our bowl should not be washed all year round, so the tripod at that time must have been clean, shiny and golden. In other words, it was not 'solemn,' but rather 'enthusiastic.'" ("Qie Jie Ting Miscellaneous Essays II": "Title Undecided" Draft) I think this should also give us an enlightenment: that is, how should we treat classical cultural heritage, should we blindly believe in them, kowtow and worship them, and enshrine them in the temple, or should we ask them to serve socialism and serve our people? In Lu Xun's words, should we preserve the national essence or should we ask the national essence to preserve us? A revolutionary should always serve the needs of reality, so it cannot but be a person who values the present and belittles the past in his academic thoughts. In this regard, Lu Xun is our great example.

    鲁迅是厚今薄古的伟大榜样
    陈鸣树
    一
    鲁迅是厚今薄古的伟大榜样。他，作为一个战士，永远执着于现实的战斗，把自己的工作毫无保留地服从于革命的需要。
    厚今薄古，实质上就是一种革命的思想，凡是在历史上起过进步作用的人物，他们当时的思想也总是厚今薄古的。早在1907年，鲁迅就在论文“摩罗诗力说”里表述过这种思想，他告诉我们，“怀古”必须“如鉴明镜”应该“时时进光明之长途，时时念辉煌之旧有”，这样才能“新者日新，而古亦不死”，这就是说，应该把历史当作一面镜子，古为今用，推陈出新。后来鲁迅一再表达过这种思想，他认为古文化虽然“百裨于后来，也束缚着后来”，因此，我们必须“不但是文艺上的遗产的保存者，而且是开柘者和建设者”。（“集外集拾遗”，“引玉集”后记）
    鲁迅写小说，大家知道，并非为了要走进“艺术之宫”，而是为了要“改良人生”揭出当时人民的病苦，以引起疗救的注意。可是，当革命逐渐深入，“急遽的剧烈的社会斗争，使作家不能够从容的把他的思想和情感熔铸到创作里去”（瞿秋白）的时候，鲁迅就毅然放下了小说的创作，而创造了与敌人短兵相接的武器——杂文。这是很为当时一些厚古薄今、重外轻中的文人学士们所“不耻”的，他们有的为鲁迅惋惜；有的讥笑鲁迅做不成艺术家了；“俄国为什么能够有‘战争与和平’这类伟大的作品产生？……而我们的作家呢，岂就永远写写杂文而引为莫大的满足么？”（“鲁迅全集补遗”：“做杂文也不易”）敌人给了鲁迅一个恶谥：“杂感专家”，“专”在“杂”里边，显然含有鄙视的意思。但鲁迅并没有理会这些苍蝇蚊子的嗡嗡声，他认为在“要做这样的东西的时候，恐怕也还要做这样的东西，我以为如果艺术之宫里有这么麻烦的禁令，倒不如不进去；还是站在沙漠上，看看飞沙走石，乐则大笑，悲则大叫，愤则大骂，即使被沙砾打得遍身粗糙，头破血流，而时时抚摩自己的凝血，觉得若有花纹，也未必不及跟着中国的文士们去陪莎士比亚吃黄油面包之有趣。”（华盖集题记）鲁迅执着于现实的战斗，不但是将写作当作投资，获得一笔优厚的利息的文士们所根本不理解的，就是在同一营垒中的战友也并不是都能了解他杂文战斗的意义。鲁迅说：“也有人劝我不要做这样的短评。那好意，我是很感激的，而且也并非不知道创作之可贵。”但是，“现在是多么切迫的时候，作者的任务，是在对于有害的事物，立刻给以反响或抗争……潜心于他的鸿篇巨著，为未来的文化设想，固然是很好的，但为现在抗争，却也正是为现在和未来的战斗的作者，因为失掉了现在，也就没有了未来。”（“且介亭杂文”：序言）就这样，鲁迅把后半生大部分的时间和精力，都献给了紧密结合革命需要的战斗的艺术——杂文，一直到死，连他计划中的中国文学史和描写唐代宫闱生活的长篇小说也没有可能得到实现。这自是文学史上的损失，但作为一个战士，在革命的暴风雨时期，他表达了千百万人民的声音，完成了他崇高的历史使命，而这，不但足以弥补了他在文学史上的损失，而且为他在文学史上树立了不朽的丰碑。现在谁会记得当时“神往唐虞”“归心元代”一心要考据出“刘歆并非刘向的儿子”的学者，和“潜心于他的鸿篇巨著”，为一万年后的文化设想的作家呢？只有执着于现实的战斗者的功绩才会与历史同在。二
    厚今薄古与厚古薄今标志着为个人和为集体的两种人生观，一向是革命与倒退或反动的两条路线的斗争。鲁迅从革命的立场出发，他批判了一切复古，恋古，思古，怀古的遗老遗少们。有些骸骨迷恋者“心神所注，辽远在于唐虞，或径入古初，游于人兽杂居之世；谓其时万祸不作，人安其天，不如斯世之恶浊沾危，无以生活”，这也仿佛如右派分子的“今不如昔论”。鲁迅认为，其实“事正背驰”，古民的“曼衍播迁，抗争劬劳”即使不厉于今，而视今必无所减。因为那时历史没有记载，所以现在想来，觉得那时十分安乐。倘使真正置身其时，“与古民同其忧患，则颓唐佗傺，复远念盘古未生，斧凿未经之世”，（“摩罗诗力说”）可见复古也永远不会满足。所以当“自诩古文明者流”林纾，严复，章士钊等张起保存国粹的大旗时，鲁迅狠狠地给予了打击，他认为首先不是我们保存国粹，而是要国粹保存我们。保存国粹和保存我们这是复古和革命二种思想的根本分歧。这个问题我觉得到今天还没有失去它的现实意义，古为今用还是今人做古人的奴隶？有些高级知识分子在实际工作中其实对这个问题并没有得到明确的解决。古典文化遗产并不是博物馆里的古董，徒供我们放着品赏，或者频频点头啧啧称道一番，甚至玩物丧志。在三十年前，鲁迅对这个问题的回答是明确的：“苟有阻碍这前涂者，无论是古是今，是人是鬼，是‘三坟’‘五典’，百宋千元，天球河图，金人玉佛，祖传丸散，秘制膏丹，全都踏倒他。”（“华盖集”：“忽然想到”六）只有破除迷信，才能做到古为今用，看来，重温鲁迅这一段话并不是多余的。有人钻进了故纸堆中，就再也钻不出来了，这正如鲁迅为我们讲述的有个明末遗民的书斋叫“活埋庵”一样，把自己活埋在里边了。但是“林回异千金之璧，负赤子而趋”，权衡得失，多向前看看，自己还是可以取舍的。否则便只好真的活埋在里面了。为古人殉葬，有什么好处呢？例如刘半农吧，五四时代也未尝不是一个战士，“后来却只做做打油诗，弄弄烂古文”，基于立场的不同，鲁迅曾公开地表示了他的憎恶：
    “我爱十年前的半农，而憎恶他的近几年。这憎恶是朋友的憎恶，因为我希望他常是十年前的半农，他的为战士，即使‘浅’罢，却于中国更为有益。”（“且介亭杂文”：“忆刘半农君”）
    三
    正如一个人不能“为艺术而艺术”一样，不可能为复古而复古，在当时，鲁迅已经清晰地看出，所谓复古、恋古、思古、怀古，都不过是一个幌子，在它的背后，隐藏着对革命的敌视，对现实的不满以及对个人的不可告人的目的的追求……
    听说有个一向鄙薄中国古典文学的右派分子最近忽然手不释卷地吟哦起李太白来，当然他并不是想写“李太白论”，或研究李太白的诗歌到底是以浪漫主义还是以现实主义为主导，他热衷的是这样一类句子：
    “抽刀断水水更流，举杯销愁愁更愁；人生在世不称意，明朝散发弄扁舟。”
    “人生得意须尽欢，莫使金樽空对月。”
    这些“厌恶现世的人们”，用鲁迅的话来说：“都是厌恶现世的仇仇”。对他们怎么办呢？还是用鲁迅的话来说：
     “仰慕往古的，回往古去罢！想出世的，快出世罢！想上天的，快上天罢！灵魂要离开肉体的，赶快离开罢！现在的地上，应该是执着现在，执着地上的人们居住的。”（“华盖集”：“杂感”）鲁迅这一段话，虽然是对辛亥革命后的遗老遗少们说的，但转赠给一小部分封建主义资本主义的遗老遗少们，并不过时。
    四
    “贵古而贱今，忽近而图远”当然并不都是“现世的仇仇”，但也不是特有“嗜痂之癖”，实在积习难除。有的人并不真在那里发什么“思古之幽情”，也并不很愿意“非三代两汉之书不读”，只是希望附古人的骥尾而荣，以便“声名自传于后世”。所谓“君子疾没世而名不称焉”，其实，想不朽的结果得到的往往是速朽。例如鲁迅的杂文吧，当时就有人劝他不必做，因为做了在将来世界史上也不会有名的，想来奉劝鲁迅不要写杂文的那位先生现在我们一定可以在世界史上看到他的大名了吧，但却也从来没有见到。因为“美国的‘文学概论’或中国什么大学（指当时——引者）的讲义，的确，总不能发现一种叫作Tsa—Wen的东西。这真使有志于成为伟大文学家的青年，见杂文而心灰意懒，原来这并不是爬进高尚的文学楼台去的梯子”，虽然，“小说和戏曲，中国向来看作邪宗的，但一经西洋的‘文学概论’引为正宗，我们也就奉为至宝了。……杂文中之一体的随笔，因为有人说它近于英国的Essay，有些人也就顿首再拜，不敢菲薄。”（“且介亭杂文二集”：“徐懋庸作‘打杂集’序”）这样看来，厚古薄今与重外轻中的血缘关系的存在已“久矣夫非一日也”了。我们有些先生言必称莎士比亚，有些先生只捧着一个屈原，认为“余子不足道也”，连鲁迅的作品也不看，“不知有汉，无论魏晋”，当然对延安文艺座谈会以后产生了一些什么主要作品更不知道。他们认为研究这些都没有学术价值。所谓“学术价值”，也就是鲁迅所说的“爬进高尚的文学楼台去的梯子”。然而，你总该认为他们对莎士比亚或屈原深有研究了吧！或者已经写出了不朽的研究著作，却也未必。他们之所以推崇莎士比亚或屈原，也只是因为“古”，设使他们生在莎士比亚或屈原同时，他们仍旧会是鄙不足道的。记得鲁迅小说“离婚”中的七大人，他用古人的“屁塞”在鼻子两旁擦了又擦，一面又连连赞赏这烂石中的“水银浸”，“屁塞”擦鼻梁，丝毫不觉得有些欠雅，就因为它是古人的。但是鲁迅问得好：“试去翻翻‘儒林外史’或‘文苑传’，可有一个将旧书当作古董的鸿儒？”
    五
    有人认为，说鲁迅是厚今薄古的榜样，不足以服人。鲁迅不是也搞旧学么？的确，鲁迅整理，考订，校勘，编集了不少古籍，也读了不少古书。可是，在鲁迅那里，古书并没有成为玩赏的古董，相反，作为他广泛运用的一种武器，借古喻今，以古鉴今，甚至以古惩今，致命地打击了敌人，例如“而已集”有一则“小杂感”：
    “刘邦除秦苛暴，‘与父老约，法三章耳。’而后来仍有族诛，仍禁挟书，还是秦法。法三章者，话一句耳。”
    寥寥几笔，画出了背叛革命的蒋介石的鬼脸。鲁迅可说完全做到了古为今用，这些例子在鲁迅杂文中是不胜枚举的。鲁迅独创性的有着高度思想性的小说“故事新编”更是在当时历史条件下古为今用的卓越范例。鲁迅即使在整理一些古典文学遗产时，他总是念念不忘于今，例如“北平笺谱序”中说：
    “意者文翰之术将更，则笺素之道随尽；后有作者，必将别辟涂
    径，力求新生；其临睨夫旧乡，当远俟于暇日也。”（集外集拾遗）鲁迅为我们讲述了这样一个故事，有个土财主，买了个周鼎回来，土花斑驳，古色古香。但是他却叫铜匠把土花铜绿擦得一干二净，一切“雅士”当然听到了无不大笑。鲁迅说：“我在当时，也不禁由吃惊而失笑了，但接着就变成肃然，好像得了一种启示。这启示并非‘哲学的意蕴’，是觉得这才看见了近于真相的周鼎。鼎在周朝，恰如碗之在现代，我们的碗，无整年不洗之理，所以鼎在当时，一定是干干净净，金光灿烂的，换了术语来说，就是它并不‘静穆’，倒有些‘热烈’”。（“且介亭杂文二集”：“题未定”草）我想这也应该给我们一种启示：就是我们究竟应该怎样对待古典文化遗产，是对它们一味迷信，顿首再拜，供奉庙堂之上呢，还是要他们为社会主义服务，为我们的人民服务？用鲁迅的话来说，是我们保存国粹呢还是叫国粹保存我们？作为一个革命者应该永远服务于现实的需要，因而表现在他的学术思想上不能不是一个厚今薄古者。在这方面，鲁迅是我们伟大的榜样。
