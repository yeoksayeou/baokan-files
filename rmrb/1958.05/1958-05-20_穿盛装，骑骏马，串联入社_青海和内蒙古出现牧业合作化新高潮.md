Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 19th - Qinghai's broad masses of herdsmen are spreading the word: "Socialism is paradise, the pastoral cooperative is the ladder to heaven." The pastoral cooperation movement on the grasslands is developing at an unprecedented speed. At the beginning of May, the number of households joining pastoral cooperatives and jointly-operated state-private ranches accounted for only 14.6% of the total number of pastoral households in the province. After only about ten days, two autonomous prefectures basically achieved pastoral cooperation.

The first to achieve cooperation was the Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. As of May 12th, the number of pastoral households participating in pastoral cooperatives accounted for about 86.6% of the autonomous prefecture's total pastoral households. The other prefecture that basically achieved cooperation was the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. By May 14th, it had established 152 pastoral cooperatives and 38 jointly-operated state-private ranches, with participating pastoral households accounting for about 79% of the total. Tianjun County, which was previously considered to have a weaker work foundation, also saw its participating pastoral households reach 89.9%, ranking first among the counties in the autonomous prefecture. The pastoral cooperation movement is also developing vigorously in Hainan and Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefectures.

In recent years, Qinghai pastoral areas have piloted a number of pastoral cooperatives. These cooperatives have generally increased production and improved the lives of herdsmen, setting an example for the broad masses of herdsmen. Coupled with the influence of the nationwide Great Leap Forward situation since last winter and this spring, the masses of herdsmen are eagerly demanding the establishment of pastoral cooperatives. Many herdsmen are running around and jointly applying to establish cooperatives. Touching stories such as sons mobilizing fathers and wives persuading husbands are constantly emerging. Most upper-class figures from various ethnic groups and representatives of religious circles, under the trend of the times and the will of the people, have also expressed their acceptance of socialist transformation. Some have applied to establish jointly-operated state-private ranches three or four times.

Based on this situation, each autonomous prefecture began in March to send large numbers of cadres deep into the yurts of herdsmen, to widely carry out socialist education, publicize the Party's guidelines and policies for the socialist transformation of animal husbandry, and help herdsmen establish cooperatives and ranches. The vast majority of leading cadres in each prefecture and county have also gone deep into the field to provide guidance.

At the same time, all localities have generally grasped the leadership of animal husbandry production. Most areas have achieved production during the day and held discussion meetings and established cooperatives and ranches in the evening. In areas that have already achieved cooperation, the socialist enthusiasm of the masses of herdsmen is being promptly directed towards building canals, planting feed, and eliminating wolves, bears, leopards and other grassland pests.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th - "Let socialism come to the grasslands sooner" has become a major event in the current real life of herdsmen of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. They gather in yurts to study the Party's pastoral cooperation guidelines, policies and methods, brewing to establish cooperative preparatory committees and actively linking up with old pastoral cooperatives.

Thousands of Mongolian, Daur, Ewenki and other minority herdsmen are happily participating in pastoral production cooperatives on the grasslands. Many male and female herdsmen are wearing festive costumes and riding fine horses to register with the cooperative preparatory committees. In famous pastures such as Xilingol, Ulanqab, Hulunbuir, Chahar and Ordos, approximately more than 20,000 pastoral households are demanding to establish or join cooperatives, accounting for more than 25% of the autonomous region's households that have not yet joined cooperatives. The Mongolian poor old herdsman Mao Lai of Abag Banner, not long ago led his son to the cooperative preparatory committee to register, he said: My son joins the cooperative, and we have hope. Some individual herdsmen near the "Vast Grassland" pastoral cooperative are demanding to join the cooperative. Three households have already combined their livestock with the livestock of the pastoral cooperative and are working with the members. Many herd owners on the Xilingol and Hulunbuir grasslands have also asked the government to establish jointly-operated state-private ranches, expressing their desire to take the socialist road.

According to the urgent demands of the masses of herdsmen, the autonomous region's pastoral areas will develop more than 940 pastoral cooperatives and more than 40 jointly-operated state-private ranches this year, increasing the number of participating pastoral households from the current 27.6% to more than 50%. Currently, Party organizations at all levels in Inner Mongolia have dispatched thousands of cadres deep into the grasslands to lead herdsmen of all ethnic groups in actively and steadily carrying out the animal husbandry cooperation movement. Party and government leading departments in various localities have also trained thousands of pastoral cooperative backbone personnel, mutual aid group leaders and CCP branch secretaries, and will continue to train more than 10,000 pastoral cooperative leading backbone personnel and accountants this year.

Inner Mongolia's socialist transformation of animal husbandry began in 1952. In recent years, more than 640 pastoral cooperatives, which are praised by Mongolian herdsmen as "flowers on the grassland," have prominently demonstrated their superiority in changing the face of the grassland and developing animal husbandry production.

　　青海和内蒙古出现牧业合作化新高潮
    新华社西宁19日电　青海广大牧民传颂着：“社会主义是天堂，牧业社是天梯”，草原上的牧业合作化运动正以空前的速度向前发展。5月初，全省加入牧业合作社以及公私合营牧场的户数只占到总牧户的14.6％，时隔十天左右，便有两个自治州基本上实现了牧业合作化。
    首先实现合作化的是海北藏族自治州。截至5月12日止，参加牧业社的牧户约占自治州总牧户的86.6％。另一个基本实现合作化的是海西蒙藏哈萨克族自治州，到5月14日已办起一百五十二个牧业合作社，和三十八个公私合营牧场，入社牧户占总牧户79％左右。过去被认为工作基础较差的天峻县，入社入场牧户也已达到89.9％，跃居自治州各县的首位。海南和玉树等藏族自治州的牧业合作化运动都在蓬勃发展。
    近几年来，青海牧区曾试办了一批牧业社。这些社普遍增加生产，改善了牧民的生活，为广大牧民树立起榜样，加上去冬今春全国大跃进形势的影响，牧民群众都迫不及待地要求建立牧业合作社，许多牧民东奔西走，联名办社。儿子动员父亲，妻子劝丈夫等动人事例不断出现。大多数民族上层人士和宗教界的代表人物，在大势所趋、人心所向的形势下，也表示接受社会主义改造，有的三番五次申请建立公私合营牧场。
    根据这个情况，各自治州从3月开始便派出大批干部深入牧民帐房，广泛开展社会主义教育，宣传畜牧业社会主义改造的方针和政策，帮助牧民建社、建场；各州、县绝大部分的领导干部也都深入现场进行指导。
    在这同时，各地一般都抓紧了对畜牧业生产的领导。大部分地区做到了白天生产，晚上开讨论会、建社办场。在已经实现了合作化的地区，牧民群众的社会主义积极性正被及时地引向兴修渠道、种植饲料和消灭狼、熊、豹等草原兽害等方面来。
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　“让社会主义早日来到草原上”，已经成为当前内蒙古各民族牧民现实生活中的一件大事。他们聚集在蒙古包里，学习党的牧业合作化方针、政策和办法，酝酿成立建社筹备委员会，积极同老牧业社挂钩。
    草原上成千上万的蒙古、达斡尔、鄂温克和其他少数民族牧民，正在喜气洋洋地参加牧业生产合作社。许多男女牧民穿着盛装，骑着骏马，到建社筹委会报名登记。在锡林郭勒、乌兰察布、呼伦贝尔、察哈尔和鄂尔多斯等著名牧场，大约有二万多个牧户正在纷纷要求建社或入社，他们占自治区未入社户的25％以上。阿巴嘎旗的蒙古族贫苦老牧民毛莱、不久以前领着他的儿子到建社筹委会报名，他说：儿子入社、我们就有了指望。“辽阔之草原”牧业社附近的一些单干牧民，都要求入社，有三户已经把自己的牲畜同牧业社牲畜合了群，同社员们一起劳动。锡林郭勒和呼伦贝尔草原上的许多牧主，也都向政府要求办公私合营牧场，表示要走社会主义道路。
    根据牧民群众的迫切要求，自治区牧区今年将发展九百四十多个牧业社和四十多个公私合营牧场，入社牧户由现在的27.6％增加到50％以上。现在，内蒙古各级党组织已经派出数千名干部深入草原，领导各民族牧民积极稳步地开展畜牧业合作化运动。各地党政领导部门还训练了上千名牧业社骨干、互助组长和中共支部书记，今年还将陆续训练一万多名牧业社领导骨干和会计。
    内蒙古畜牧业社会主义改造，是从1952年开始的，几年来，被蒙古牧民誉为“草原上的花朵”的六百四十多个牧业社，在改变草原面貌和发展畜牧业生产方面，已经突出地显示出了优越性。
