Xinhua News Agency, 21st: At the invitation of the All-China Federation of Natural Science Specialized Societies, Li Shimei, a termite expert from Xinhui County, Guangdong, gave his first report to the Beijing scientific community on the afternoon of the 20th, presided over by Wu Youxun, vice chairman of the National Science Federation.

Li Shimei will continue to give reports in Beijing and exchange experiences with entomologists.

The report of this termite expert, who only received junior high school education and is now only thirty-five years old, makes people believe that close contact with reality will certainly lead to the development of science; a person who has not received higher education can also become an expert as long as he studies hard in practice. His report makes people believe that in the socialist system, a champion can emerge in any profession.

In his report, Li Shimei said that he was originally a layman on termites. He saw that his relatives' houses and many buildings in the south were severely damaged by termites. He hired private termite control companies to treat them, but they charged high prices, kept their technology secret, and were arrogant. Therefore, he decided to study termite prevention and treatment methods himself. From January 1953 to June 1956, he started by studying entomology and literature books related to termites, and then went to nineteen counties and cities in Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hunan provinces to conduct on-site observations and experiments from house to house. He carried out treatment measures and meticulous observations on termites in more than 2,000 houses, dozens of bridges, sluice gates, and more than 80 ships and wooden boats, and cracked more than 1,800 termite nests before he obtained a set of effective methods for termite control; he understood the secrets of the termite world. During the research and experiment process, he was squeezed out and attacked by fourteen private termite control companies. Especially after he succeeded in his research, the termite control companies threatened and lured him, wanting him to partner with them to operate termite control companies for profit, and some offered him high salaries to join their business. However, the Huicheng Town People's Government of Xinhui County vigorously supported his research work, and was willing to help him solve problems such as funding and housing, and encouraged and educated him. Therefore, he always adhered to the research work for the benefit of the people and did not waver due to the threats and inducements of the termite control companies. After the research was successful, Li Shimei did not regard his knowledge and technology as his own private property. He immediately taught his knowledge and technology to the students in the study class held by the town people's government without reservation. In December 1957, the Huicheng Town People's Government formed these students into a termite prevention and control work team, with the town mayor as the captain and Li Shimei as the deputy captain. After two months of hard work, only 376 yuan was spent, and termites in the whole town were basically eliminated. In his report, Li Shimei introduced his methods for termite control and the living rules and habits of termites that he learned in actual observation and experiments.

After Li Shimei's report, he also answered questions raised by the audience.

Xinhua News Agency, 21st: The Beijing entomological community gathered today to welcome termite expert Li Shimei. Entomologists and toxicologists praised Li Shimei's achievements and exchanged academic experiences with him.

Chen Shixiang, chairman of the Chinese Entomological Society and director of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who presided over the symposium, first expressed his thoughts on Li Shimei's research achievements. He believed that Li Shimei's research on termites embodied the socialist scientific path. Li Shimei conducted research starting from the needs of production practice, and applied the research results to practice; while the capitalist scientific path starts from personal fame, gain and personal interests. Second, he realized the problem of socialist working methods from Li Shimei's research work. He said that Li Shimei basically eliminated the termites in Huicheng Town in two months with an expenditure of 376 yuan, which is an example of achieving scientific work with more, faster, better and more economical results. Generally, scientists always ask for laboratories, libraries and assistants before starting research. Third, Li Shimei's research work reminded him of the moral issues of scientific workers. Li Rumei is willing to contribute his knowledge and technology to the people without reservation, showing the noble morality of a scientific worker. Fourth, he felt the importance of implementing the mass line in scientific work from Li Shimei's research achievements. He said that in the current Great Leap Forward, mass inventions and creations are emerging like mushrooms after rain, which shows that the wisdom of the masses is infinite. Fifth, he thought of the issue of evaluating scientific achievements from Li Shimei's achievements. He said that in the past, scientists evaluated scientific achievements from the perspective of papers, ignoring the value in practical applications; now we should pay attention to whether scientific achievements can completely solve practical problems. He believes that Li Shimei's research on termites has surpassed the international level; at present, no country has a more complete method for termite control than Li Shimei's. Chen Shixiang believes that Li Shimei's work provides some valuable issues in academics, such as Li Shimei's proposal that there may be two types of termite kings, one specializing in reproduction and the other specializing in issuing orders, and that there must be water absorption lines in the life of termites. These are very important issues in academic and practical prevention and control work. At present, entomologists all over the world have not solved many problems in the living rules of termites.

Ma Shijun, head of the Beijing branch of the Chinese Entomological Society and researcher at the Institute of Entomology, said that he realized from Li Shimei's achievements that in today's society, as long as you are willing to work hard, you will definitely achieve something; as long as your work is needed by the people, it will be quickly promoted, and it will definitely be valued by the Party and the government. He said that Li Shimei's work is an impetus for scientists - urging them to face the reality of production.

Lin Changshan, director of the Entomology Teaching and Research Section of the Biology Department of Peking University, said that Li Shimei's research work encountered many difficulties. If it were before liberation, Li Shimei's work would have been difficult to succeed, and perhaps his life would have been in danger, because termite control companies would definitely persecute him.

Zhang Zongbing, professor of Peking University and toxicologist, said that what impressed him most was that Li Shimei's success was related to "daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to do". Li Shimei jumped out of the routine of general scientific work and broke the superstition. For example, the termite-killing agent used by Li Shimei is made of a combination of three to seven agents, which is rare. General insecticides are often used alone, and even if they are mixed, there are only two agents mixed.

At the meeting, toxicologist Xiong Yao and entomologists asked and answered many questions with Li Shimei. During the discussion, entomologists and toxicologists pointed out that Li Shimei's methods and views are in line with the theory of entomology. For example, the poison used by Li Shimei is slow-acting, which is because ants are insects that feed each other. In the process of feeding each other, the poison can be widely spread. If the fast-acting poison kills the termites that come into contact with the poison all at once, the poison cannot be widely spread, and the effect is not good.

Finally, Chen Shixiang announced at the meeting that the Council of the Chinese Entomological Society had approved the acceptance of Li Shimei as a member.
  The welcome meeting was jointly held by the Institute of Entomology, the General Society of the Chinese Entomological Society, and the Beijing Branch.

    科学工作者的榜样
    白蚁专家李始美到京作报告
    昆虫学界集会欢迎，昆虫学会接受他为会员
    新华社21日讯　广东新会县的白蚁专家李始美应中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会的邀请，20日下午在全国科联副主席吴有训主持下，向北京科学界作了第一次报告。
    李始美将在北京继续作报告，并且和昆虫学家交流经验。
    这位只受过初中教育，现在只有三十五岁的白蚁专家的报告，使人们相信：密切联系实际，一定会使科学得到发展；一个没有受过高等教育的人，只要在实践中通过刻苦钻研，也可能成为专家。他的报告，使人们相信：在社会主义制度下，行行都可以出状元。
    李始美在报告中说，他对白蚁本来是外行的，因为看到他的亲戚的房子和南方许多建筑一样，白蚁为害严重，请私人开业的白蚁行除治，索价昂贵，技术保密，盛气凌人。因此他决心自己钻研白蚁的防治方法。从1953年1月到1956年6月，他从攻读昆虫学和有关白蚁的文献书籍开始，紧接着到广东、广西、湖南三省的十九个县市中按家按户进行实地观察和试验，对二千多间房屋、数十座桥梁、水闸和八十多只轮船、木船中的白蚁进行了除治措施和缜密的观察，破获了一千八百多个白蚁巢，才获得了除治白蚁的一套有效的方法；了解了白蚁世界的秘密。他在研究试验过程中，曾受到十四家私营的白蚁行排挤和打击，特别是当他研究成功以后，白蚁行又威胁利诱他，要他合伙经营白蚁行牟利，有的用高薪聘请他参加白蚁行营业。但是新会县会城镇人民政府竭力支持他的研究工作，愿意帮助他解决经费和房屋等问题，对他进行了鼓励和教育，因此他始终为着人民的利益坚持研究工作，没有为白蚁行的威胁利诱而动摇。研究成功以后，李始美并不把他的知识技术据为私有，他立即在镇人民政府举办的学习班上无保留地将他的知识和技术传授给学员们。1957年12月，会城镇人民政府把这批学员组成防治白蚁工作队，由镇长担任队长，李始美任副队长，经过两个月的苦战，只花了三百七十六元经费，基本上消灭了全镇白蚁。李始美在他的报告中介绍他除治白蚁的方法以及他在实际观察试验中了解到的白蚁的生活规律和习性。
    李始美报告以后，还解答了听众们提出的问题。
    新华社21日讯　北京昆虫学界今日集会欢迎白蚁专家李始美。昆虫学家和毒理学家们都称赞李始美的成就，并和他交流了学术经验。
    座谈会主持人、中国科学院昆虫研究所所长、中国昆虫学会理事长陈世骧首先对李始美的研究成就发表感想。他认为李始美对白蚁的研究，体现了社会主义的科学道路。李始美是从生产实际的需要出发进行研究，又把研究成果应用到实际中去；而资本主义的科学道路，是从个人名利和个人兴趣出发的。第二，他从李始美的研究工作中体会到社会主义的工作方法问题。他说，李始美在两个月内用三百七十六元的经费基本上消灭了会城镇的白蚁，正是科学工作多快好省的范例，一般科学家做研究，总是首先要求实验室、图书馆和助手，有了这一切条件然后才开始研究。第三，李始美的研究工作，使他连想到科学工作者的道德问题。李如美愿意无保留地把他的知识技术贡献给人民，表现了一个科学工作者的高尚道德。第四，他从李始美的研究成就，感到科学工作中贯彻群众路线的重要。他说，在当前大跃进中，群众中的创造发明像雨后春笋一般涌现出来，这说明群众的智慧是无穷的。第五，他从李始美的成就想到了科学成果的评价问题。他说，过去科学家评价科学成果是从论文着眼的，忽视在实际应用中的价值；现在应该重视科学成果是否能彻底解决实际问题。他认为李始美对白蚁的研究已经超过了国际水平；现在各国还没有比李始美的除治白蚁的方法更完善的方法了。陈世骧认为李始美的工作在学术上提供了一些有价值的问题，例如李始美提出白蚁的蚁王可能有两种，一种专门生殖，另一种专门发号施令，以及白蚁的生活中必须有吸水线等，在学术上和实际防治工作上都是很重要的问题，现在全世界昆虫学家对于白蚁的生活规律还有许多问题没有解决。
    中国昆虫学会北京分会负责人、昆虫研究所研究员马世骏说，他从李始美的成就，想到在今天我们这个社会里，只要你肯干，就一定会有成就；只要你的工作为人民所需要，就一定会迅速推广，而且一定会得到党和政府的重视。他说，李始美的工作对科学家说来是一个督促——督促他们面向生产实际。
    北京大学生物系昆虫学教研室主任林昌善说，李始美的研究工作曾经遇到不少困难，如果在解放以前，李始美的工作是难成功的，也许生命也有危险，因为白蚁行一定会迫害他。
    北京大学教授、毒理学家张宗炳说，使他感触最深的是李始美的成功和“敢想、敢说、敢做”有关系。李始美跳出了一般科学工作的陈规，破除了迷信。例如李始美用的杀白蚁药剂是由三种到七种药剂配合成的，这是很少有的做法，一般杀虫药剂常常是单独用的，即有混合，也只有两种药剂的混合。
    会上毒理学家熊尧和昆虫学家们同李始美互相提出和解答了许多问题。在讨论的时候，昆虫学家和毒理学家们指出李始美的方法和观点是符合昆虫学的理论的。例如李始美用的毒药是作用不快的，这正是因为蚁类是互相喂食的昆虫。在互相喂食的过程中，可把毒药广为传布开去，如果作用快的毒药一下子把碰到毒药的白蚁毒死，就不能使毒药广为传布开来，效果反而不好。
    最后陈世骧在会上宣布中国昆虫学会理事会通过接受李始美为会员。
  欢迎会是由昆虫研究所、中国昆虫学会总会和北京分会联合举行的。
