　　　　　　To Get Close to the Soil
　　A professor said: "For thousands of years, education has been divorced from productive labor. Intellectuals have followed the old path of 'excelling in learning to become an official.' Now we must follow the Party's instructions and go deep into production practice." What are the results of doing so? Just like plants approaching the soil and children approaching their mothers, they immediately blossom and bear fruit, and immediately receive nourishment. Chairman Mao pointed out long ago that "many so-called intellectuals are actually the most ignorant, while workers and peasants sometimes know more than they do." What is the way to transform these people who only have book knowledge into true intellectuals? One of the best ways is to have them participate in practical work and become practical workers. Recently, many higher education institutions, such as Zhejiang University and Chongqing University, have launched work-study programs, and many teachers and students have gone deep into production practice. The situation has greatly changed. Students who originally only had book knowledge have become all-round talents. Teachers who previously stayed in their rooms designing and couldn't write a word, quickly made designs after going into practice with the help of workers. Facts changed people's thinking, and they eagerly requested to take make-up lessons in production practice. From "empty-headed" intellectuals to walking out of their studies and into the great furnace of production practice, this is a big change. However, facts require people to get closer to the soil and closer to their mothers in order to grow vigorously.

    要接近土壤
    一位教授说：“千百年来的教育都是脱离生产劳动的，知识分子是走‘学而优则仕’的老路。现在必须遵循党的指示深入到生产实际中去。”这样做的结果怎样呢？真像植物接近了土壤，孩子接近母亲一样，马上开花结果，马上得到了滋养。毛主席早就指出，“许多所谓知识分子，其实是比较地最无知识的，工农分子有时倒比他们多一点。”有什么办法使这种仅有书本知识的人变为名副其实的知识分子呢？最好的办法之一就是使他们参加到实际工作中去，变为实际工作者。最近，浙江大学、重庆大学等许多高等院校开展勤工俭学活动，许多教师和学生深入生产实践，情况就大变，本来只有书本知识的学生，变成了文武双全的能人。以前关在屋里设计，动不了笔的教师，到实际中以后，由于得到了工人的帮助，很快就做出了设计。事实改变了人们的思想，他们急切地要求到生产实践中去补课。从“空头”知识分子到走出书斋，到生产实践的大洪炉里去，这是很大的转变。但是，事实要求人们，要更加接近土壤，接近母亲，才能茂盛地生长起来。
