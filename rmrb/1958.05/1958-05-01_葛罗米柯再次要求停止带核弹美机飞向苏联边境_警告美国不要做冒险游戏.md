Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 29th: TASS reports from Moscow on the 29th: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a statement at a press conference on the 29th, once again reminding the U.S. government of the grave responsibility it bears for the possible consequences of the actions of U.S. aircraft carrying nuclear weapons. Gromyko hopes that the U.S. government will be wise and, for the sake of peace, cease the unprovoked flights of U.S. aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs towards the Soviet border. He said that such flights are intolerable.

Gromyko said that U.S. officials remain silent about the fact that if the Soviet Air Force were to act like the U.S. Air Force, and also fly towards the U.S. border in response to the U.S. Air Force's flights towards the Soviet border, what would happen? The Soviet Foreign Minister said that in this case, it would be natural for the Soviet Union to take such action.

Gromyko then asked, if Soviet or U.S. radar installations detected atomic bombers from other countries approaching their borders, what conclusions would both sides draw? In this case, would there still be the possibility or time to find out whether the other countries' bombers' flights were well-intentioned or malicious? He said that there would be no time for diplomatic negotiations then.

Gromyko said that it is almost certain that in this case, the aircraft would not return, and the world would fall into disaster. Another possibility can be imagined: U.S. aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs crossed the Soviet border on one of their flights, and in order to repel the incoming threat, it would be necessary to launch rockets. And rockets cannot be taken back.

Gromyko said that we are not talking about all this to exaggerate, nor to scare anyone, but to illustrate how serious the danger that humanity faces is when playing risky games with atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that there is now no doubt that this action was taken with the consent of the U.S. government. From the statements of official spokespersons of the U.S. government, especially from the position that the U.S. has taken in the Security Council, it can be seen that the U.S. still intends to continue the dangerous provocation of military aircraft carrying nuclear bombs in the future. The U.S. government apparently wants to divert attention from the substance of the issues raised by the Soviet government, and it proposed a proposal in the Security Council to establish supervision in the Arctic region, without stopping the provocative flights of U.S. bombers. The U.S. government insists that this supervision can help prevent sudden attacks. There is no need to say how much this proposal is worth, because it includes a large area of Soviet territory in the surveillance area, while not including the U.S. mainland at all. In addition, the entire issue of supervision is divorced from any practical disarmament measures and has become a purely propaganda measure. Gromyko said that the drafters of this proposal have once again shown that they neither intend to seriously discuss the entire issue of disarmament, nor to discuss the issue of preventing sudden attacks. They just need reconnaissance materials about Soviet territory.

Gromyko said that some people in the U.S. insist that the Soviet Union's warnings about the dangers of U.S. aircraft actions show that the Soviet Union simply "does not want to hold a summit meeting." Gromyko said that if the U.S. truly hopes to successfully conduct summit talks to ease international tensions and reduce the danger of atomic war, then why does it continue to allow bombers carrying hydrogen bombs to fly towards the borders of other countries?

The Soviet Foreign Minister emphasized that if someone wants to use the Soviet Union's desire for peace to achieve their selfish goals, use the Soviet Union's concern for the successful holding of a summit meeting to speculate, and delusionally demand that the Soviet government no longer expose actions aimed at endangering Soviet security and undermining peace in order to promote the holding of a summit meeting, then this is a very serious miscalculation. Summits of various countries are not small change for exchange.

The Soviet Foreign Minister said that we hope that all countries concerned about preventing the danger of the outbreak of atomic war and easing international tensions will support our call to stop U.S. bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border. He said that this serious danger must be eliminated as soon as possible to prevent the situation from developing to an irreversible point.

### 葛罗米柯再次要求停止带核弹美机飞向苏联边境  警告美国不要做冒险游戏

    葛罗米柯再次要求停止带核弹美机飞向苏联边境
    警告美国不要做冒险游戏
    新华社30日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科29日讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯29日在记者招待会上发表声明，再次提醒美国政府注意它对载有核武器的美国飞机的行动可能引起的后果所负的严重责任。葛罗米柯希望美国政府明智些，为了和平的利益停止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机无端地向苏联边境飞行。他说，这种飞行是不能容忍的。
    葛罗米柯说，美国人士闭口不谈这一事实，即如果苏联空军也像美国空军那样行动起来，并且针对美国空军飞向苏联边境一事也飞向美国边境，那会发生什么事呢？苏联外交部长说，在这种情况下，苏联采取这种行动会是很自然的。
    葛罗米柯接着问道，假如苏联或美国的雷达装置发现，其他国家的原子轰炸机正在接近它们的边境，那么，双方会做出怎样的结论呢？在这种情况下，难道还有可能或有时间来弄清楚其他国家的轰炸机的飞行是怀好意还是怀恶意这一问题吗？他说，那时再也没有外交谈判的时间了。
    葛罗米柯说，几乎可以肯定，在这种情况下飞机是回不去了，而世界便会陷入灾难之中。可以设想另外一种可能：载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机在它们某一次飞行时越过了苏联边境，为了击退到来的威胁，就将有必要发射火箭。而火箭则是不能把它再收回来的。
    葛罗米柯说，我们谈这一切不是为了夸大其辞，不是为了要吓唬谁，而是为了说明，拿原子武器和氢武器做冒险游戏，这使人类面临的危险是多么严重。
    苏联外交部长说，现在已没有任何疑问：这一行动是在美国政府同意下采取的。从美国政府官方发言人的发言里，特别是从美国在安全理事会上所抱的立场可以看出，美国今后仍然打算继续进行带有核弹的军事飞机的危险挑衅。美国政府显然为了转移对苏联政府所提出的问题的实质的注意，它向安理会提出在北极地区建立监督的建议，而不停止美国轰炸机的挑衅飞行。美国政府硬说，这种监督能有助于防止突然的进攻。这项建议有多大价值是用不着说的，因为它把苏联很大一块领土包括到监督区内，而丝毫不包括美国的本土。此外，整个这项监督问题同任何实际的裁军措施都脱离开来，而变成了纯粹的宣传措施。葛罗米柯说，这项建议的起草人再一次表明，他们既不打算认真地讨论整个裁军问题，也不打算讨论其中的防止突然袭击问题。他们只不过需要有关苏联领土的侦察材料罢了。
    葛罗米柯说，美国的某些人士硬说，苏联关于美国飞机行动的危险性的警告表明苏联根本“不希望召开最高级会议”。葛罗米柯说，如果美国真正希望成功地进行最高级会谈以缓和国际紧张局势和减少原子战争的危险，那么为什么它仍然继续让载有氢弹的轰炸机向其他国家的边境飞行呢？
    苏联外交部长强调指出，如果有人想利用苏联爱好和平的意愿来达到他们的自私目的，利用苏联对顺利召开最高级会议的关心进行投机，妄想要求苏联政府为了促进最高级会议的召开而不再揭露旨在危害苏联安全和破坏和平的行动，那么这是极严重的错误打算。各国最高级会议并不是兑换用的零钱。
    苏联外交部长说，我们希望一切关心防止爆发原子战争的危险和缓和国际紧张局势的国家支持我们要求停止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机向苏联边境飞行的呼吁。他说，必须及早消除这种严重危险，以免事态发展到无法挽回的地步。
