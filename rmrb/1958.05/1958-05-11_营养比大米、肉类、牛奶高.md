Professor Dai Xin-jie of the Biology Department of Zhongshan University in Guangzhou, recently presented an academic paper entitled "Several Questions Regarding Our Food" at the Guangdong Science Hall, based on over sixty experiments conducted over more than a year. The paper proposes that the nutritional value of a mixed diet of sweet potatoes and soybeans is higher than that of rice, meat, or milk. This conclusion was reached after experiments using several hundred white mice. He believes that sweet potatoes contain large amounts of starch and various vitamins needed by the human body, while soybeans are rich in protein and fat.

    营养比大米、肉类、牛奶高
    广州中山大学生物系教授戴辛皆，最近在广东科学馆宣读了他自己根据一年多来六十次以上试验而写成的一篇学术论文“关于我们同食品的几个问题”。论文中提出：甘薯大豆混合食用的营养价值，高于大米、肉类或牛奶。这个结论是他用几百只小白鼠试验后得出的。他认为，甘薯含有大量人体需要的淀粉和各种维生素，黄豆则含有丰富的蛋白质和脂肪。
