Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, May 1st. The Yituli River Forestry Bureau of the Greater Khingan Range in Inner Mongolia, on the eve of the "May Day" holiday, completed the state plan for producing 350,000 cubic meters of timber for the entire year, eight months ahead of schedule, with both people and equipment safe. This marks a great victory in production.

Under the leadership of the Party Committee, the bureau's employees continuously overcame conservative and complacent thinking in the first quarter, mustered their energy to overcome the severe cold, and adopted measures to improve enterprise management, launching a production upsurge. Several times, production peaks exceeded the daily production plan by one or even several times. In April, when the ice and snow melted and the mountain areas became muddy, difficulties arose in timber gathering and transportation. The Party Committee and enterprise leaders promptly took measures to repair highway branch lines, shortening the timber gathering distance by about half and improving timber gathering efficiency. The employees launched a "Hundred Red Flags Competition," proposing to complete the annual task in four months as an action to celebrate "May Day." This broke the convention that the second quarter is the off-season, and enabled production to continuously leap forward.

    提前八个月完成木材生产计划
    据新华社牙克石1日电　内蒙古大兴安岭伊图里河林业局，在“五一”节前夕，提前八个月，人马平安地完成了原定全年生产三十五万立方公尺木材的国家计划，在生产上打了一个大胜仗。
    这个局的职工在党委领导下，第一季度由于不断克服保守和自满思想，鼓起干劲战胜严寒，并且采取措施改进企业管理，掀起了生产高潮，曾几次出现过超过日产量计划一倍乃至数倍的生产高峰。4月份冰雪开化山场泥泞，给集材和运材带来了困难。党委和企业领导及时采取措施，抢修公路岔线，把集材距离缩短一半左右，提高了集材效率。职工们开展了“百面红旗竞赛”，提出以四个月完成全年任务的行动向“五一”献礼的口号。这样，就打破了二季度是淡季的陈规，使生产不断跃进。
