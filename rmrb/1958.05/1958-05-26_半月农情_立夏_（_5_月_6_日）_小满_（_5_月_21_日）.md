    Half-Month Agricultural Situation
    “Start of Summer”（May 6th）——“Grain Full”（May 21st）
    In the southern regions, the transplanting of double-cropping early rice has been completed. In some areas with earlier seasons, such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Sichuan provinces, a small amount of early rice has already begun to head. In Luzhou, Sichuan, most of the early rice has already shown ears, and this year it is growing particularly well. According to estimates by the agricultural departments here, the yield per unit area in some townships could reach 1,000 jin. In the Yangtze River basin, this period is the time for cultivating, topdressing, weeding, and pest control for early rice. Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces have experienced a lot of rain in the past half-month, which has adversely affected some early rice.
    The transplanting of intermediate rice in the southern regions has basically been completed. Some areas that did not complete their early rice planting plans due to drought have expanded the area planted with intermediate rice.
    The provinces in the Yangtze River basin have started or will start cultivating seedlings for double-cropping late rice. In Sichuan, the seedbeds for double-cropping late rice have begun to be sown and are expected to be completed by May 26th. In Guangxi, the sowing of late rice seedbeds will begin comprehensively around "Grain Full."
    The winter wheat in the provinces of the Yellow and Huai River basins is gradually approaching maturity, following the Yangtze River basin. Most areas are making intense preparations for the summer harvest, and a few areas have already begun harvesting. In the Jinan region of Shanxi Province, where a bumper harvest is certain, Yongji, Ruicheng, Linyi, and Pinglu counties began harvesting before "Grain Full." The provinces in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are in the peak period of wheat harvesting, and many special districts have entered a period of full-scale rush harvesting. "Transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting wheat are like fighting a fire." "Grain Full" is the busiest season for agricultural activities in this area.
    In Gansu, Xinjiang and other places, winter wheat began to head during this stage. The later-stage management of wheat here is still ongoing.
    Before "Grain Full," the spring-sown coarse grain crops in the northern regions have been basically sown. In Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost province, more than 80% of the sowing plan had been completed by mid-May.
    Summer hoeing of spring-sown coarse grain crops has generally begun in areas with earlier seasons. This year, the start time of summer hoeing in many areas has been advanced along with the advance of the sowing period.
    In some areas in the north, the spring potato cutting period has been delayed due to a shortage of sweet potato seedlings. In order to support each other in completing the potato planting plan, Nanyang in Henan and Xingtai in Hebei were still airlifting potato seedlings in mid-May.
    The summer sowing of coarse grains and oil crops in the Yellow and Huai River plains will begin soon. The broad masses of agricultural cooperatives in this area are making intense preparations to complete this year's summer planting tasks.
    The spring sowing of oil crops was basically completed in mid-May. Peanuts sown in spring in the northern regions have generally emerged. In areas where peanuts are intercropped in wheat stubble, intercropping in wheat fields has also begun. In Inner Mongolia, flax was completely sown in early May. In order to strive for the dual harvest of oil and hemp this year, flax cultivation techniques have been generally improved. Before "Grain Full," some areas in Gansu and other provinces were still rushing to sow flax. The sowing period of flax in these areas was delayed due to drought this year.

    半月农情
    “立夏”（5月6日）——“小满”（5月21日）
    南方地区的双季早稻已全部插秧完毕。季节较早的广东、广西和江西、四川等省的少数地区的早稻已经抽穗。四川泸州的早稻已大部见穗，今年生长得特别好，据这里农业部门估计，有的乡的单位产量可以达到千斤。长江流域各地的早稻，在这个阶段里正是中耕、追肥、除草、灭虫的时期。浙江、江西、湖南、湖北、江苏等省在这半个月里多雨，部分早稻因雨受到不利影响。
    南方地区的中稻已基本插完，有些因旱没有完成早稻种植计划的地区，都扩大了中稻面积。
    长江流域各省已经开始或将要开始双季晚稻的育秧。四川的双季晚稻秧田已开始播种，预计在5月26日播完。广西在“小满”前后全面开始晚稻秧田的播种。
    黄、淮流域各省的冬小麦，继长江流域之后逐渐接近成熟，多数地区正紧张地进行具体的夏收准备，少数地区已开始收割。丰收已定的晋南地区的永济、芮城、临猗、平陆四县，在“小满”前就开镰了。长江中下游各省正是收麦盛期，许多专区都进入全面抢收。“栽秧割麦如救火”。“小满”前后，是这一带农事活动最繁忙的季节。
    甘肃、新疆等地的冬麦，在这个阶段开始抽穗。这里的小麦后期管理，仍在继续进行。
    “小满”以前，北方地区的春播杂粮作物已基本种完。最北部的黑龙江省到5月中旬已完成播种计划80％以上。
    季节较早地区普遍开始了春播杂粮作物的夏锄。今年许多地区夏锄开始时间随着播种期的提前而提早了。
    北方有些地区由于缺乏薯秧推迟了春薯扦插期。为了互相支援完成种薯计划，河南南阳和河北邢台之间5月中旬还在空运薯苗。
    黄、淮平原杂粮、油料的夏播很快就开始了。这个地区的广大农业社正在为完成今年的夏种任务而紧张地进行准备。
    油料的春播在5月中旬已基本结束。北方地区春种的花生已普遍出苗。种植麦茬花生的地区，也开始在麦田里套种。内蒙古的胡麻在5月上旬已全部播完，为了争取今年的油、麻兼收，普遍改进了胡麻种植技术。在“小满”以前，甘肃等省有的地区还在抢种胡麻。这些地区今年胡麻播种期因旱推迟。
