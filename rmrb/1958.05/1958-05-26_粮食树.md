    “Grain Tree”
    In the mountains and forests of Huilong District, Jianyang County, Fujian Province, there is a wild tree that produces grain - the "Bitter Bead Tree." Its branches and trunk are tall and thick. It blooms every spring, and in summer it is full of finger-sized fruits. Local farmers pick it, grind it into flour, and make noodles and other foods from it. The taste is similar to wheat-based pasta.

    “粮食树”
    在福建省建阳县回龙区山林中，有一种生长粮食的野生树——“苦珠树”，枝干高大粗壮，每年春季开花，夏季就结满指头般大小的果实。当地农民把它采下来磨成粉，作成面片面条等食用，跟麦制的面食味道差不多。
