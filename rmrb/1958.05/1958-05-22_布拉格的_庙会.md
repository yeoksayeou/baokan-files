Prague's "Temple Fair"
Every spring, the largest traditional "temple fair" begins in Prague's northern suburb on "October Revolution" Square.
The "temple fair" is what the Chinese in Prague call it; its official name should be "St. Matthew's Market." The central part of the "temple fair" consists of about fifty diverse entertainment venues, including elaborate spinning chairs, hanging baskets, swings, and carousels, as well as various air gun shooting games, electric cars, and acrobatics performances, etc. Around the square are more than sixty temporary sales shops made of wood, offering a variety of goods that rival department stores. One sales shop specializes in Chinese handicrafts, with the words "Gifts" written in Chinese at the entrance. You can also buy some traditional specialties from the "temple fair," the most famous of which is a gingerbread sweet shaped like a heart, brightly colored, and often used as a symbol of love; the gate of the "temple fair" also uses it as a pattern.
The "St. Matthew's Market" lasts for a whole month. Children are the main guests here, but adults' interest is no less. They sit on spinning chairs, ride carousels, swing, and compete in shooting, enjoying their leisure time to the fullest. The economic value of the "temple fair" should not be underestimated; it often sells goods worth hundreds of thousands of crowns a day. The Chinese "Gifts" shop is also often crowded with people lining up to buy exquisite handicrafts.
The "St. Matthew's Market" has a long history. On a small hill outside Prague, there is an old small church named after Saint Matthew. On Saint Matthew's Day each year, the church holds religious ceremonies and various religious activities as usual, and a market naturally formed near the church. Over time, commercial activities gradually took over, and the religious nature became weaker and weaker. Later, acrobatics and other entertainment programs also began to be staged here, making this festival a place for mass cultural and recreational activities.
Now, the "St. Matthew's Market" has been moved from the hill where the church is located to near "October Revolution" Square, and the original religious nature has completely disappeared. Today's "temple fair" is mainly the center of spring cultural and recreational activities for the people of Prague, especially the children of Prague, and is a place for large-scale mass entertainment and commercial activities.

### 布拉格的“庙会”

    布拉格的“庙会”
    每逢春天，在布拉格北郊“十月革命”广场上，最大的传统“庙会”就开始了。
    “庙会”是在布拉格的中国人对它的称呼，它的正式名字应该是“圣马太市集”。“庙会”的中心部分是约五十个形形色色的娱乐场所，这里有精巧的转椅、吊篮、秋千和旋转木马，有各种各样的汽枪射击，还有电汽车和杂技表演等等。广场周围是用木料搭成的六十多个临时售货店，它的品种比之百货公司毫无逊色。有一处售货店专卖中国手工艺品，门口用中文写着“礼物”二字。你还可从“庙会”上买到一些传统的特产，最出名的是一种用姜饼制成的甜食，状如心形，色彩鲜艳，人们常用它作为爱情的象征，“庙会”的大门也是拿它做图案的。
    “圣马太市集”要持续整整一个月。孩子们是这里的主客，成年人的兴趣也并不稍低。他们坐转椅、骑木马、打秋千、比赛射击，尽情欢度他们的休息时光。“庙会”的经济价值也不容低估，常常一天售出价值几十万克朗的货物。中国“礼物”店前也经常拥挤着排队购买精致手工艺品的人们。
    “圣马太市集”已有悠久的历史。在布拉格郊外的小山上，有个以圣徒马太命名的古老的小教堂。在每年圣马太日，教堂照例举行宗教仪式和各种宗教活动，教堂附近就自然而然形成了集市。随着时间的推移，商业活动逐渐占上风，宗教性质越来越淡薄了。后来，杂技和其他娱乐节目也开始在这儿上演，使这节日又成为群众文娱活动的场所。
    现在，“圣马太市集”已从教堂所在的山上迁移到“十月革命”广场附近，当初的宗教性质完全消逝了。今天的“庙会”主要是布拉格人、特别是布拉格孩子们春季文娱活动的中心，是一个具有很大群众性的娱乐和商业活动的场所。　　　　（翊）（附图片）
