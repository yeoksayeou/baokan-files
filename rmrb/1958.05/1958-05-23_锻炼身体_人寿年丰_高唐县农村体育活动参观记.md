    Exercise for Health, Longevity for All
    —A Visit to Rural Sports Activities in Gaotang County
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Fu Hongde

    In mid-May, this reporter accompanied representatives from the Rural Sports On-Site Conference to visit rural Gaotang County in Shandong. Upon entering Gaotang County, villages along the way often had high jump and long jump sand pits, as well as single and parallel bars. Climbing ropes hung from large trees; in each village or at the village entrance, there was a simple sports ground. Slogans and murals vigorously promoting sports activities were visible everywhere. On the east wall of the old town, there was a slogan that read: "Exercise for health, longevity for all."

    We arrived at the Wu’ai Agricultural Cooperative, located forty li from the county seat, and were even more excited to see the rich and varied sports activities of the cooperative members. As soon as the dawn bell rang, the cooperative's sports ground came alive. After running together, the young and middle-aged began their favorite sports: some climbed the single bars, some practiced weightlifting, and some jumped long and high; girls generally preferred skipping rope and kicking shuttlecocks by the courtyard; the elderly were not far behind, practicing martial arts or doing morning exercises in groups of two or three. The crowd of visitors was particularly attracted to these elderly "athletes." When people asked them why they exercised, Shao Jingtai, a ninety-three-year-old man, replied with a smile: "We suffered for most of our lives in the past. Good days are coming, and everyone wants to live a few more years to see the village's electric lights and telephones."

    As soon as breakfast was over, when the cooperative members went to the fields to work, they brought not only their cultural textbooks but also simple sports equipment. During the twenty-minute break in the middle, the fields and roads became their temporary sports grounds, jumping long and tug-of-war were done with joy, and skipping rope competitions were even more intense. The cooperative members composed many catchy rhymes to praise this happy life combining labor with culture, entertainment, and sports. For example, some sang: "The field is a battlefield, the field is a classroom; it is also a club, and also a sports ground, working is so joyful!" "You jump high and I throw, compare strength on the tug-of-war rope, train the body well to develop production, and strive for thousands of catties of grain and cotton." This agricultural cooperative with two hundred and seventy-three households and one thousand and seventy-one people now has a minimum of three hundred people regularly participating in morning exercises, and as many as six hundred; two hundred and eighty-nine young men and women have all participated in various exercise programs they love; and more than fifty elderly men and women also get up early every day to stretch their arms, bend their waists, and exercise their bodies.

    The sports ground and sports equipment of the Wu’ai Agricultural Cooperative were also made by the cooperative members themselves, without spending a penny from the cooperative. Their high jump stands are very simple, with a few nails hammered into two wooden sticks and inserted into the ground, and the crossbar is made of sorghum stalks; the seven sets of weights are all converted from stone rollers; and the old cannon barrels were used to make very sturdy single bars. The cooperative members also composed a clapper talk to praise their thrifty efforts in running sports: "The youth are iron-willed men, overcoming difficulties in every possible way, charging ahead in field work, and heroic men on the sports ground. To train the body for production, solving the equipment problem by fighting at night, manufacturing thousands of pieces of equipment, without spending a penny from the cooperative; running the cooperative thriftily to promote sports, cadres and the masses all like it."

    Since the Wu’ai Agricultural Cooperative launched mass sports activities, it has brought about a vigorous development situation in production. According to Lu Daquan, the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party branch in the cooperative, before the cooperative carried out sports activities, the young people could not get up on time in the morning, and they were slow to go to the fields to work; during the break in the field work, everyone was sprawled out sleeping, and when they woke up, they were shaky and had no energy to work. After carrying out sports activities, the cooperative members generally got up one to two hours earlier, and went to the fields to work neatly and with vigor. Now the attendance rate of the entire cooperative has basically reached 100 percent.

    锻炼身体　人寿年丰
    ——高唐县农村体育活动参观记
    新华社记者　傅洪德
    5月中旬，记者曾随农村体育现场会议的代表们去山东高唐县农村参观。踏上高唐县境，路上经过的村落，常常看到跳高、跳远的沙坑和单杠、双杠。大树上，还吊着爬绳；在每个村中或村头的空场上，都有一个简易的运动场。鼓动开展体育活动的大标语和壁画，到处可见。旧城东墙上就写着这样的一幅标语：“锻炼身体，人寿年丰”。
    我们到离县城四十华里的五爱农业社，看到社员们丰富多采的体育活动，就更感到兴奋。当黎明的钟声刚刚响过，社里的运动场上就活跃起来了。青壮年们一起跑步之后，就开始了自己爱好的各项运动：有的攀单杠，有的练举重，有的在跳远和跳高；姑娘们一般都喜欢在院边跳绳和踢毽子；老年人也不落后，他们也在三三两两地练武术或做早操。参观的人群特别被这些老年“运动员”所吸引。当人们问他们为什么锻炼身体时，九十三岁的邵景太老大爷喜笑颜开地回答：“过去受了多半辈子苦，好日子快到了，谁也想多活几年看看村上的电灯和电话。”
    早饭刚过，当社员们下田劳动的时候，除带上文化课本之外，还带着简单的运动器具。在中间二十分钟的休息时间内，地头、路上就成了他们的临时运动场，跳远、拔河干的欢，跳绳赛的更紧张。社员们编了很多首顺口溜来歌颂这种劳动与文娱、体育相结合的愉快生活。如有的唱：“田间是战场，田间是课堂；又是俱乐部，又是运动场，干起活来喜洋洋！”“你跳高来我投掷，拔河绳上比力气，炼好身体搞生产，争取粮棉千百斤。”这个有二百七十三户、一千零七十一人的农业社，现在经常参加早操的最少时三百人，多到六百人；二百八十九名男女青壮年，都参加了自己所爱好的各种锻炼项目；还有五十多位老大爷、老大娘，也每天早起伸胳膊弯腰炼身体。
    五爱农业社的运动场和运动器具也都是社员自制的，没花社里一分钱。他们的跳高架子十分简单，两根木棒上砸上几个钉子向地里一插就成了，横杆用的是高粱秸；七付举重都是用石吨改制的；用过去的土炮筒就制成了很坚固的单杠。社员们还编了这样一首快板，来歌颂他们勤俭办体育的事迹：“青年人铁打的汉，千方百计克服困难，田间干活打冲锋，运动场上英雄汉。为了生产把身炼，解决器具打夜战，制造器具千百件，没花社里一分钱；勤俭办社搞体育，干部群众都喜欢。”
    五爱农业社开展群众性体育活动之后，已给生产带来蓬勃发展的局面。据社里的中共党支部书记吕大全告诉记者：这个社在开展体育活动之前，小青年早上不能按时起来，下田干活是拖拖拉拉；田间劳动休息时，大家是东倒西歪睡大觉，睡了起来摇摇晃晃干活也没劲。开展体育活动后，社员普遍起床提早了一至两小时，下田干活整整齐齐，精神焕发。现在全社的劳动出勤率已基本上达到了百分之百。
