    Qingshui County Communes Establish Technical Night Schools
    (Our report) According to the Shanxi Daily: In just three and a half months, Qingshui County, Shanxi Province, established 301 amateur technical night schools in all 308 agricultural cooperatives, basically realizing the popularization of science and technology in every commune.
    In January of this year, the Qingshui County Science Popularization Association summarized the experiences of the 24 technical night schools that were piloted last year. Qingfeng Commune in Duanshi Township of this county increased cotton production from more than ten jin in 1956 to 49 jin in 1957, and also greatly increased grain production due to improved farmers' scientific and technological knowledge. Therefore, Qingshui County decided to universally establish amateur technical night schools in all agricultural cooperatives throughout the county. Subsequently, Li Dequan, the first secretary of the county party committee, made a mobilization report at an enlarged three-level cadre meeting, calling on the entire party to learn science and technology and become both red and expert cadres within five years. The county party committee also convened a meeting of township party committees and general branch secretaries, emphasizing that the party must grasp science and technology and ensure good management of the technical night school work. The County Communist Youth League Committee convened a meeting of League cadres, requiring League members to take the lead in running technical night schools. Relevant departments listed this work as one of the main contents of checking grassroots work. Relevant departments introduced the experience of Qingfeng Commune in Duanshi Township in establishing technical night schools at meetings of labor models, production team leaders of agricultural cooperatives, and party propagandists. Due to full cooperation, everyone took action, relied on the masses, and the masses enthusiastically participated in the technical night school studies. In Qingfeng Commune in Duanshi Township and July 1st Commune in Daping Township, the number of young people participating in technical night school studies reached 70%-90% of young men and women.
    The school sites for technical night schools generally use existing folk schools or other public houses. Teachers are technical extension workers from technical extension stations, folk school teachers, junior high school graduates, and doctors from health centers and health stations. In order to improve the teaching quality of teachers, they set up transmission stations, where the County Agricultural Construction Bureau regularly conducts technical training according to different agricultural seasons. Since this spring, the County Science Popularization Association has compiled more than 6,000 copies of 12 types of easy-to-understand scientific and technological materials suitable for the farming season and combined with production, which has solved the problem of teaching materials for technical night schools.
    After the establishment of the technical night school, the students democratically discussed and formulated a teaching system. They adopted the method of learning whatever technology is needed for the farm work being done, which solved the masses' requirements for agricultural technology, thereby greatly encouraging the masses' enthusiasm for learning. The masses reflected: "Technical night schools are great, they don't delay work much and the results are high, not only can you learn technology, but you can also improve your culture."

    沁水县社社建立技术夜校
    本报讯　据山西日报报道：山西沁水县在短短三个半月的时间里，使全县三百零八个农业社建立起三百零一个业余技术夜校，基本上实现了社社开展科学技术普及工作。
    今年1月，沁水县科普协会总结了去年试办的二十四个技术夜校的经验。这个县的端氏乡青锋社由于提高了农民科学技术知识，棉花由1956年的十几斤提高到1957年的四十九斤，粮食产量也大大增加。于是，沁水县决定在全县农业社普遍建立业余技术夜校。接着，县委第一书记李德全在三级扩大干部会上作了动员，号召全党学习科学技术，在五年内成为又红又专的干部。县委又召开了乡党委、总支书记会议，强调党必须抓好科学技术，保证管理好技术夜校工作。共青团县委召开了团干部会，要求共青团员在办技术夜校工作中起带头作用。各有关部门把这一工作列为检查基层工作的主要内容之一。各有关部门在劳动模范、农业社的生产队长、党的宣传员等会议上都介绍了端氏乡青锋社建立技术夜校的经验。由于全面协作，大家动手，依靠群众，参加技术夜校学习的群众十分踊跃，端氏乡青锋社和大坪乡七一社，仅青年参加技术夜校学习的即达男女青年的70％—90％。
    技术夜校的校址一般是利用原有民校或其他公房。教师是由技术推广站的推广员、民校教员、初中毕业生、卫生所和保健站的医生担任。为了提高教师的教学质量，他们设立了传授站，由县农建局根据不同农时定期地进行技术传授。今春以来，县科普协会给技术夜校编写了适合农时季节，结合生产，通俗易懂的科学技术资料十二种共六千多份，解决了技术夜校的教材。
    技术夜校建立后，由学员民主讨论，制订了教学制度。他们采取了干什么农活学什么技术，解决了群众对农业技术的要求，因而大大鼓舞了群众的学习积极性，群众反映：“技术夜校就是好，误工不多收效高，不仅能学技术，文化也能提高”。
