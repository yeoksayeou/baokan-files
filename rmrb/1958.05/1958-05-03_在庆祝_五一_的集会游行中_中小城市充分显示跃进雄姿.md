Xinhua News Agency, 2nd. Today, one year after the rectification movement, the face of small and medium-sized cities across the country has greatly changed. The "May Day" parades showed the people of these cities' vivid creativity and high revolutionary drive.

The significant achievements made by the broad masses of workers in the technical innovation movement were vividly demonstrated in the "May Day" celebration rallies and parades in many small and medium-sized cities. In Harbin, workers participated in the parade with more than 100 kinds of new products. Workers drove twenty-four tractors of various sizes manufactured by themselves at the forefront of the parade. Following closely behind the tractor group were combine harvesters, three-wheeled vehicles, agricultural vehicles, battery cars, and trolleybuses. Behind these machines were trucks loaded with a wide variety of new products such as gas turbines, water pumps, generators, farm tools, bearings, speedboats, and machine tools. This steel torrent formed a new product parade contingent more than two miles long, receiving enthusiastic cheers and praise along the way. At the Jiangsu Province and Nanjing City celebration rally, the worker gift-giving team received a particularly warm welcome. They brought a large number of new products that had been trial-produced in a short period of time during the Great Leap Forward, breaking conventions, innovating technologies, and using revolutionary methods. Some of them have reached international standards, such as the three-channel carrier telephone produced by the Nanjing Radio Factory and the television picture tube successfully trial-produced by the Nanjing Bulb Factory. Workers from Fuzhou, Xining, Lanzhou, Kunming, Hohhot, Jinan, Guiyang, Qaidam and other places also participated in the parade with new product samples or models. Celebrations and parades in some places became major reviews and exhibitions of new products. Among these new products are the artificial rainfall machine created by workers in Gansu, which has attracted national attention, and the solar stoves that can be widely used in Gansu; the 2160-type gas engine successfully trial-produced by the Yunnan Machinery Factory before "May Day," and the 1,500x biological microscope newly made by the Yunnan Optical Instrument Factory; and the artificial cotton made by Qinghai workers from wild plants.

The "May Day" celebration rallies and parades in small and medium-sized cities also showed that local industries in many regions have made gratifying progress. The first blast furnace of the Jinan Iron and Steel Plant produced its first molten iron at 2 a.m. on "May Day" morning, and the workers of the plant carried a model of the blast furnace to participate in the parade. In order to vigorously support agricultural production, Jinan workers have already manufactured many new products such as trucks. In the celebration parade of 50,000 people of all ethnic groups in Guiyang, a mountain city in southwestern China, the worker contingents composed of railways, local state-owned factories and mines, and other units numbered 22,000. The number of workers participating in the parade was ten times greater than the total number of workers in Guizhou Province before liberation, which shows that Guiyang is leaping towards becoming an industrial city. The hundreds of new products they carried in the parade proved that Guiyang's industrial level has taken a step forward. The two universal tractors driving in front of the worker contingent were warmly welcomed by the masses. This type of tractor was recently manufactured by the Guizhou Farm Tool Factory, which had difficulty manufacturing even double-wheeled double-share plows in the past. Charts in the Yumen City parade showed that Yumen City's petroleum drilling, oil extraction, and oil refining workers have overfulfilled their production plans for the first quarter of this year, and oil extraction workers have increased crude oil production by more than 4,000 tons for the country in the first four months of this year. When celebrating the holiday, all the workers in the city expressed that while developing the petroleum industry vigorously, they will also vigorously develop local industries and build 43 new factories of various types.

Farmers in the suburbs of some small and medium-sized cities also participated in the "May Day" celebration parade. Farmers in the suburbs of Kunming City have completed 80% of this year's water conservancy tasks and 96% of the fertilizer accumulation tasks. They have created and promoted 20,000 pieces of indigenous machinery in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, which can save 50,000 labor forces. Today, they carried the windmills, wooden rail cars and various machines they made to participate in the parade.

The "May Day" celebration rallies and parades in cities inhabited by ethnic minorities were very enthusiastic. Students of nine ethnic minorities from Yunnan Nationalities Institute, dressed in festive ethnic costumes, participated in the parade drumming elephant-foot drums and dancing peacock dances, Axi Jumping Moon dances, and other dances. Representatives of these ethnic groups rode in a car decorated as a rocket, symbolizing that the 5.7 million ethnic minorities in Yunnan Province are leaping towards socialism at rocket speed. More than 40,000 people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot held a grand meeting on the morning of May 1 to celebrate "May Day" and the 11th anniversary of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. People of all ethnic groups, as close as one family, spent "May Day" in festive costumes, with soaring enthusiasm and incomparable joy.

    在庆祝“五一”的集会游行中
    中小城市充分显示跃进雄姿
    新华社2日讯　整风运动一年后的今天，全国各中小城市的面貌大大改观。在“五一”游行的队伍中，显示了这些城市人民生动的创造性和高涨的革命干劲。
    广大职工在技术革新运动中取得的重大成就，在许多中小城市的“五一”节庆祝游行大会上生动地表现出来。哈尔滨的工人们，带着一百多种新产品参加游行。工人们驾驶着自己制造的二十四台大大小小的拖拉机走在游行队伍的前列。紧跟着拖拉机群的，是联合收割机、三轮汽车、农业用汽车、蓄电池车和无轨电车。在这些机械的后面是一辆辆卡车，满载着气轮机、水泵、发电机、农具、轴承、快艇、机床等丰富多样的新产品。这个钢铁巨流组成的新产品游行大队有二里多长，沿途受到人们热烈的欢呼和赞扬。在江苏省暨南京市的庆祝大会上，职工献礼队受到了特别热烈的欢迎。他们带来了在生产大跃进中，打破常规，革新技术，用革命的办法，在短时间内试制出来的大批新产品。其中有的已经达到国际水平，如南京有线电厂生产的三路载波电话机、南京灯泡厂试制成功的电视显象管等。福州、西宁、兰州、昆明、呼和浩特、济南、贵阳、柴达木等地的工人，都带着新产品实物或模型来参加游行。有些地方的庆祝会和游行，成了新产品的大检阅和大展览。这些新产品当中，有甘肃工人创造的，引起全国注意的人工降雨机、可以广泛在甘肃利用的太阳能灶；云南机械厂在“五一”前夕试制成功的二一六○型煤气机，云南光学仪器厂新制成的一千五百倍生物显微镜；青海工人用野生植物制成的人造棉花等。
    中小城市的“五一”节庆祝游行大会，还显示出许多地区的地方工业有了可喜的发展。济南铁厂第一座高炉在“五一”晨二时已经流出了第一炉铁水，这个厂的工人抬着高炉的模型参加了游行。济南职工为了大力支援农业生产，已经制成了载重汽车等许多新产品。在祖国西南山城——贵阳市五万各族人民组成的庆祝游行队伍中，由铁路、地方国营厂矿等单位组成的工人队伍就达二万二千多人。参加游行的工人，比解放前贵州省工人总数多十倍左右，这表明，贵阳市正在向工业城市跃进。他们抬着游行的几百种新产品，证明贵阳市的工业水平已经向前跃进了一步。行驶在工人队伍前面的两辆万能拖拉机，受到了群众的热烈欢迎。这种拖拉机是过去制造双轮双铧犁都有困难的贵州农具厂在最近制造出来的。玉门市游行队伍中的图表表明玉门市石油钻井、采油、炼油职工已经超额完成了今年第一季度的生产计划，采油工人在今年头四个月内，就为国家增产了原油四千多吨。全市职工在欢庆节日的时候表示：在石油工业大发展的同时，还要大力发展地方工业，新建各种类型的工厂四十三个。
    有些中小城市郊区的农民也参加了“五一”节庆祝游行大会。昆明市郊区农民已经完成今年水利任务的80％和积肥任务的96％，他们在水利和积肥中创造和推广了两万件土机械，可节省五万个劳动力。今天，他们抬着自己制造的风力水车、木轨车及各种机械参加游行。
    在少数民族聚居的城市，“五一”节庆祝游行大会开得十分热烈。云南民族学院九种少数民族的学员，穿着节日的民族服装，敲着象脚鼓，跳着孔雀舞、阿细跳月等舞蹈参加游行。这些民族的代表乘在一辆装饰成火箭的车上，标志着云南省五百七十万少数民族正以火箭般的速度向社会主义跃进。呼和浩特市各族人民四万多人，5月1日上午举行隆重大会，庆祝“五一”节和内蒙古自治区成立十一周年。亲如一家的各族人民身着节日盛装，以冲天的干劲和无比的欢乐，渡过了“五一”节。
