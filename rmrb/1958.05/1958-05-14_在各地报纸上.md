　　In Newspapers Across the Country

　　Peony Flowers Bloom in May
　　Gansu Daily, on May 10th, dedicated an entire page to reporting on the Technological Revolution Promotion Conference held in the Dingxi Special District. The page included the poem "Peony Flowers Bloom in May" written by the poet Li Ji for the conference, a series of poems and paintings created by poet Wen Jie and painter Geng Han for the conference, and an editorial titled "The Vehicle of the Technological Revolution is Set in Motion," congratulating the heroic people of Dingxi. The news reported on the conference, which included a creative force of three thousand people from all walks of life, bringing with them the fruitful results of their march towards science and technology. The conference was conducted in a lively manner, combining exhibitions, improvements, observations, learning, research, and promotion, with on-site visits, immediate evaluations, in-depth study of objects, and exchange of experiences. The conference was filled with communist spirit and the heroic ambition to conquer nature. In the first eight days of the conference, 7,364 new tools were created, greatly exceeding the number of exhibits. The report was inspiring, the poetry and paintings complemented each other, and the layout was also very lively.

　　Four Hundred Thousand Pieces
　　On the 12th, the New China Daily's third page headline depicted the unprecedented prosperity of amateur mass creation in Changshu County. During the entire winter-spring production campaign, the masses in this county created approximately 400,000 slogans, poems, clappers, ditties, rhyming verses, storytelling, and novels. These works were all related to current work and the thinking of the masses, making a great contribution to the great leap forward in production. For example, last winter, the masses in Baimao Township had difficulties with ice accumulation for fertilizer, and the pioneer assault team created works such as "Ice and snow, we are pioneers, let's compete and see who is the hero," to encourage the masses to move forward. The Changshu County Committee of the Communist Party of China attached great importance to the prosperity of mass creation. In addition to the responsible comrades personally writing and compiling, they also urged the Party committees of various townships and the county cultural center to vigorously collect and promote these works, and to select outstanding works for compilation into booklets. Cadres in various townships also compiled the creations of the masses into literacy textbooks. For example, the first lesson in the Xin Zhuang Township literacy textbook was: "Xin Zhuang Township, a good place, the township and commune are busy with planning. This year, the rural areas are making a great leap forward, thousands of dan of fertilizer, thousands of jin of grain, thirty thousand pigs, ten thousand sheep, eliminate the four pests, wipe out illiteracy, green trees provide shade and fish fill the ponds, Xin Zhuang Township is a good place."

　　Cannot Wait Any Longer
　　The Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee recently held an administrative meeting to specifically discuss the establishment of Jiangxi University, Jiangxi Institute of Technology, and Jiangxi University of Finance and Economics. At this meeting, the argument of "poor conditions" and "difficulties" was strongly criticized. Vice Governor Fang Zichun said: We have waited eight years for conditions, we cannot wait any longer, conditions are created, there are always difficulties, and they can be overcome with the help of fraternal schools. The comrades present at the meeting also unanimously agreed that the leap forward in production cannot be separated from the leap forward in culture and science. It has now been decided to establish these three universities starting this year, and preparatory committees have been organized separately. The Jiangxi Daily published this decision, which inspires the people of the entire province, on its front page on the 10th.

　　Using Water Power to Build All-Purpose Factories
　　On the 11th, the Hunan Daily's front page featured a notable column, publishing the pioneering initiatives of three counties in using water power to build all-purpose factories. The Zao Duan Commune in Longhui County has put into production a factory that uses water power to drive machines for cotton ginning, cotton carding, rice milling, and oil pressing. It can grind 500 jin of flour, gin 200 jin of cotton, and card 100 jin of cotton every day. Aoshan Township in Guidong County and Dongmenqiao Township in Xintian County are building agricultural and sideline product processing plants and all-purpose factories powered by water. After these factories are completed, some will be able to drive more than fifteen kinds of machines, and some will not only do processing work, but also carry out the production of blast furnace iron smelting and manufacturing granular fertilizer.

    牡丹花开五月天
    甘肃日报在5月10日以一版整版地位报道定西专区召开的技术革命促进大会。版面上有诗人李季为大会写的“牡丹花开五月天”的诗，有诗人闻捷和画家耿汉等为大会作的组诗与画，还有题为“技术革命的车子开动了”的社论，向英雄的定西人民祝贺。新闻报道了大会情况，这次会包括各行各业的三千人的创造大军，带来了向科学技术进军的累累果实。大会的开法生动活泼，边展览、边改进、边看、边学、边研究、边推广，现场参观，就地评比，钻研实物，交流经验。大会充满着共产主义风格和征服大自然的英雄气魄。在大会的头八天内，就创造了七千三百六十四件新工具，大大超过了展览的数目。报道内容，鼓舞人心，诗画相映，版面也很活泼。
    四十万篇
    12日，新华日报三版头条描绘了常熟县群众业余创作空前繁荣的景象。在整个冬春生产运动中，这个县的群众就创作了口号诗、快板、小调、顺口溜、说唱和小说等共约四十万篇。这些作品都是结合当前工作和群众思想的，为生产大跃进立下了很大功劳。如去冬白茆乡群众对敲冰积肥有畏难情绪，开路先锋突击队就创作了“冰冻冰冻，我们是先锋，和你比比，谁是英雄”等作品，鼓励群众前进。中共常熟县委对繁荣群众创作很重视，除负责同志亲自动手编写外，还督促各乡党委和县文化馆大力收集、推广，并选择优秀作品编印成册。各乡干部也把群众的创作编成识字课本。如辛庄乡识字课本第一课就是：“辛庄乡，好地方，乡里社里规划忙。今年农村大跃进，千担肥料千斤粮，三万生猪一万羊，除四害，扫文盲，绿树成荫鱼满塘，辛庄乡是好地方。”
    不能再等了
    江西省人民委员会最近召开行政会议，专门讨论了创办江西大学、江西工学院、江西财经学院的问题。在这个会议上有力地批判了“条件差”、“有困难”的论调。方志纯副省长说：等条件已等了八年，不能再等了，条件是创造出来的，困难总是有的，在各兄弟学校的帮助下是可以克服的。到会的同志也一致认为，生产的跃进离不开文化和科学的跃进。现已决定从今年开始创办这三所高等学校，并分别组织了筹建委员会。10日江西日报的一版上刊登了这个振奋全省人心的决定。
    利用水力建万能厂
    11日湖南日报的一版上有一组引人注意的专栏，在专栏内刊登着三个县利用水力兴建万能工厂的创举。隆回县造端社利用水力带动轧花、弹花、碾米、榨油等机械的工厂，已投入生产。每天可以磨粉五百斤，轧花两百斤，弹花一百多斤。桂东县鳌山乡和新田县东门桥乡，正在兴建以水力为动力的农副业加工厂和万能工厂。这些工厂建成后，有的能带动十五种以上的机械，有的不仅做加工活，还要进行鼓风熔铁、制造颗粒肥料的生产。
