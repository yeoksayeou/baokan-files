Commoner Bi Sheng Invented Movable Type Printing

In the Tang Dynasty, woodblock printing was invented, but woodblock printing still had shortcomings. Once a book was printed, the woodblocks painstakingly carved would be set aside and unused.

Bi Sheng was an ordinary commoner in the Song Dynasty. Seeing the shortcomings of woodblock printing, he resolved to improve it. After years of painstaking research, he invented movable type printing. He carved characters out of clay, then hardened them in the fire. When it was time to print a book, he would pick out the characters one by one and arrange them, tightly surrounding them with iron rings. The characters were then affixed to an iron plate with molten rosin and wax, so they could be printed. After printing, the iron plate could be heated, and the characters could be removed and reused. Today, the lead type used in printing is evolved from clay movable type.

    平民毕升发明活字印刷
    唐朝时发明了木板印刷术，但是木板印刷术仍有缺点，当一部书印完以后，辛辛苦苦刻出的木板也就放置一旁没有用了。
    毕升是宋朝时的一个普通平民，他看到木板印刷术的缺点，决心加以改良，经过多年刻苦钻研、发明了活字印刷术。他用胶泥刻成字块，再在火中烧硬，要印书的时候把字一个个拣出排好，四边用铁圈紧紧围住，字块下面用熔化的松香和蜡粘牢在铁板上，就可以印刷了；印完把铁板烧热，又可把字块拆下来重新加以利用。今天印刷上用的铅字正是从泥活字演变而成的。
