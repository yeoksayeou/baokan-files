Mass Production of “August 1st” Brand Tractors

(By our newspaper) A crimson tractor appeared before Tiananmen Square in the parade celebrating "May Day" in the capital. This is the "August 1st" brand universal tractor successfully trial-produced by the Jiangxi Local State-Owned Machinery Factory.

According to the person in charge of machinery manufacturing, the "August 1st" brand universal tractor is one of the better models among the sixty-odd tractor models that have already been trial-produced in our country. It has 27 horsepower and can be used in both paddy fields and dry land; it consumes little fuel and has high work efficiency; it can undertake more than 50 kinds of operations such as transportation and water pumping.

The "August 1st" brand universal tractor has these advantages because, over the past two years, the Jiangxi Provincial Party and government leaders have trialed 23 models of tractors from eleven countries, absorbing the advantages of various models and the unique performance requirements of paddy fields for tractors.

Jiangxi was able to successfully trial-produce tractors because a tractor trial-production team was formed under the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee, absorbing various technical talents and adopting a comprehensive large-scale collaboration method; at the same time, the broad masses of workers and staff broke away from the mysterious view of technology and made it. The successful trial production of the "August 1st" brand universal tractor proves that as long as you dare to think and dare to act, and organize large-scale collaboration, any complex product can be manufactured. The First Ministry of Machine Building Industry of the Central Government has approved the mass production of this type of tractor. The initial plan is to produce 1,000 to 2,000 units this year.

### “八一”牌拖拉机成批生产

    “八一”牌拖拉机成批生产
    本报讯　首都庆祝“五一”的游行队伍里，有一架紫红色的拖拉机出现在天安门前，这就是江西地方国营机械厂试制成功的“八一”牌万能拖拉机。
    据机械制造方面负责人说：“八一”牌万能拖拉机是目前我国已经试制的六十几种型号拖拉机中较好的一种。它有二十七马力，能水田和旱地两用；用油量低而工作效率高；能承担运输、抽水等五十多种作业。
    “八一”牌万能拖拉机所以有这些优点，是因为江西省党政领导上两年来试用十一个国家二十三种型号的拖拉机，吸取了各种型号的优点和水田对拖拉机所要求的特有性能。
    江西所以能够试制成功拖拉机，是由于在省委、省人委会领导下组成了拖拉机试制小组，吸收各种技术人材采取全面大协作的办法；同时由于广大职工群众破除了对技术的神秘观点，而制成的。“八一”牌万能拖拉机试制成功，证明只要敢想、敢作，组织大协作，任何复杂的产品也是能够制造的。中央第一机械工业部已批准成批生产这种拖拉机。初步计划今年生产一千台到两千台。
