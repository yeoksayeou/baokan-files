Xinhua News Agency, 28th: The inner city districts of Dongcheng and Xicheng in the capital launched a "guerilla warfare" campaign to smoke out sewer rats today. At 5 PM, approximately 20,000 "igniters," consisting of cadres, workers, and soldiers, took charge of designated areas. They ignited sulfur, contained in iron vessels, and placed it into over 6,000 main sewer line manholes and some household line manholes. The manholes were then sealed, allowing the sulfur smoke to permeate over 300 kilometers of the sewer system, eliminating the sewer rats. After dusk, safety inspectors from each street conducted three checks to assess the sulfur combustion. Any smoke leaks were immediately addressed and sealed.

Sewer rats are a common type of large rat, each weighing about half a catty (approximately 0.55 pounds). They are adept swimmers and prefer to reside and breed in sewers, often venturing into homes to steal food or damage property. According to investigations by the Beijing Municipal Hygiene and Epidemic Prevention Station, about one-third of the house rats in the city are sewer rats.

Based on the habits of sewer rats, the joint rat extermination headquarters of Dongcheng and Xicheng districts decided to launch a unified seven-day campaign from the 25th to the 31st. They are employing a comprehensive approach of poisoning, beating, smoking, and blocking to eliminate sewer rats. During these days, households have been placing "Antu" and "zinc phosphide" poisoned bait, blocking rat holes, cutting off food sources, and using various tools to capture and kill rats, forcing them into the sewers, launching a comprehensive encirclement and suppression.

The Xuanwu and Chongwen districts in the outer city of Beijing previously used the same method to smoke out sewer rats on May 13th, achieving significant results. Density surveys show that the density of rats above ground in the two districts has decreased from 2.8% to 1.1%.

### 沟鼠的末日到了  首都内城开展熏歼沟鼠“地道战”

    沟鼠的末日到了
    首都内城开展熏歼沟鼠“地道战”
    新华社28日讯　首都内城东城、西城两个区今天展开了一场熏歼沟鼠的“地道战”。下午五时，由干部、工人、战士等担任的约两万名“点火员”，分片包干，把装在铁容器里的硫磺点燃后，放到六千多个下水道干线检查井和部分户线检查井里。然后封闭井口，使硫磺烟串入三百多公里的下水道，熏灭沟鼠。傍晚以后，各街道的安全检查员分三次检查硫磺燃烧情况，发现有漏烟处，立刻进行抢堵。
    沟鼠是常见的一种大家鼠，每只体重半斤左右，善游泳，喜欢在下水道内栖居繁殖，也常串到屋内偷吃或咬毁东西。根据北京市卫生防疫站的调查证明，城内地上的家鼠约有三分之一是沟鼠。
    根据沟鼠的习性，东城和西城两个区的灭鼠联合指挥部决定从25日到31日，统一行动，苦战七天，采取毒、打、熏、堵的综合措施，消灭沟鼠。这几天，家家户户投放了“安妥”“磷化锌”毒饵，堵鼠洞，绝鼠粮，还用各种工具捕打老鼠，逼鼠下沟，上下夹攻，全面围剿老鼠。
    北京市外城宣武、崇文两个区曾在5月13日用同样方法熏歼沟鼠，取得了很大战果。经过密度调查，两个区地上老鼠的密度已由2.8％降到1.1％。
