Why?

    Heavy Labor Not Suitable Before and After Meals
    According to physiological research, when people are about to eat, the digestive juices in the stomach and intestines secrete in large quantities to welcome and digest food.
    The secretion of digestive juices is the responsibility of the digestive glands in the stomach and intestines. When these glands work, they need a large supply of blood to provide them with nutrients and oxygen, etc. In addition, there is a part of the brain that specializes in eating; it's called the "food center".
    If you engage in heavy labor before meals, on the one hand, the blood is distributed to the muscles of the whole body, which affects the work of the gastrointestinal glands in secreting digestive juices; on the other hand, the nerve center is not prepared and cannot immediately direct the gastrointestinal work to stimulate appetite.
    After eating, the digestion work is proceeding intensively. Engaging in heavy labor at this time, when blood is distributed to the muscles, will also affect digestion. Over time, it can cause gastrointestinal diseases.
    It is still possible to engage in general light labor before and after meals. (Shi)

专栏：为什么？

    饭前饭后不宜重劳动
    根据生理学家研究，当人们将要进食的时候，胃肠里的消化液大量分泌，来迎接食物，消化它们。
    消化液的分泌，是由胃肠的消化腺来负担的。这些腺体工作时，需要大量的血液供给它们养料和氧气等等。此外，脑子里有一部分专管吃饭这件事的神经；叫“食物中枢”。
    如果饭前干重劳动，一方面血液分布到全身肌肉去了，影响了胃肠腺体分泌消化液的工作；另方面，神经中枢也没有准备，不能立时指挥胃肠工作，来引起食欲。
    饭吃下去，消化工作正在紧张的进行。这时干重劳动，血液都分布到肌肉里去，也会影响消化工作，日久就会引起肠胃病。
    饭前饭后进行一般较轻的劳动还是可以的。　　　（士）
