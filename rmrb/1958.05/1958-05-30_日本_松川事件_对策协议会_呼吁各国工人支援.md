Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Tokyo News: Japan's "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasure Council has issued an appeal to more than one hundred trade unions in countries around the world, calling for rescue of innocent Japanese workers framed in the "Matsukawa Incident" fabricated by the reactionary Japanese government nine years ago.

On August 17, 1949, a train derailment and overturning accident occurred in Matsukawa, Fukushima Prefecture. The Japanese government, which was trying its best to suppress the worker movement, fabricated the "crime" that workers caused the train derailment and arrested twenty national railway workers and "Toshiba" electric factory workers. Subsequently, the Japanese ruling clique instructed the Japanese Supreme Court to sentence innocent workers to death and more than 20 years of imprisonment, and other heavy penalties. Under the continuous struggle and rescue efforts of the Japanese working class and the broad masses of the people, the Supreme Court had to acquit and release three workers, but the remaining seventeen workers are still in prison.

The appeal calls on all trade unions to protest against the persecution of the working class by the Japanese government and the Supreme Court in the name of all workers, and hopes to provide these innocent workers with material and spiritual assistance.

The appeal also stipulates that August 17th will be the "International Day of Action" for rescuing the persecuted in the "Matsukawa Incident", and various rescue activities will be launched on this day.

    日本“松川事件”对策协议会
    呼吁各国工人支援
    新华社29日讯　东京消息：日本“松川事件”对策协议会向世界各国一百多个工会发出呼吁书，呼吁救援九年前在日本反动政府制造的“松川事件”中受到陷害的日本无辜工人。
    1949年8月17日在福岛县松川地方发生火车出轨倾复事件。极力镇压工人运动的日本政府就捏造工人制造火车倾复事件的“罪名”，逮捕了二十名国营铁道工人和“东芝”电机厂工人。随后，日本统治集团指使日本最高裁判所对无辜工人分别判处死刑和二十年以上徒刑等重罪。在日本工人阶级和广大人民的不断斗争和救援下，最高裁判所不得不把三名工人宣判无罪释放，但是其余的十七名工人至今还被关在监狱里。
    呼吁书呼吁各个工会以全体工人名义抗议日本政府和最高裁判所对工人阶级的迫害，并且希望给予这些无辜工人以物质和精神上的援助。
    呼吁书还规定8月17日为救援“松川事件”被迫害者的“国际行动日”，并且在这一天展开各种救援活动。
