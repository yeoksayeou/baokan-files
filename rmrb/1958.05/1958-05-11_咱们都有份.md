　　We All Have a Share
　　Yang Xuan
    Speaking of our country's current social order, who doesn't say it's good? In recent years, counter-revolutionaries have been almost entirely eliminated, and new social mores are slowly developing. There are countless stories of new people and new deeds of picking up lost items, helping the elderly, and loving the young. No wonder Aunt Chen always says to people, "Society is so peaceful now." However, precisely because of this peace, Aunt Chen also says, "What is there left for us residents to do to help the police with public security work! As long as we residents don't have any problems ourselves, who has time to worry about others?"
    I think Aunt Chen's idea is wrong. The current social order is good, but that doesn't mean there isn't a single bad person left! Don't we still sometimes hear about hooligans causing trouble, petty thieves stealing, and counter-revolutionaries carrying out sabotage? These all tell us that there are still some parasites and bad elements who are unwilling to repent and are secretly doing shameful things behind people's backs, causing everyone to suffer.
    Of course, it is the responsibility of the public security comrades to find these bad guys and prevent them from running wild. However, residents also have a role to play in doing this work well. Our government cannot do anything without the masses, and public security work is even more so. Because bad elements are hiding and sneaking around, it is not very easy to discover them. However, if we all pay more attention, it will be much easier! Taking Beijing as an example, if all three million residents of the city care about public security work, we will have three million pairs of eyes to monitor those bad eggs. No matter how cunning they are, they will not escape the eyes of our three million people.
    Helping the government with public security work won't take much effort. Because everyone is familiar with their own neighborhood, it is easy to spot someone suspicious who suddenly appears in our vicinity. As long as we immediately report what we see to the police station, we are helping the government with public security work. Of course, public security work is not limited to this one thing, such as fire prevention, theft prevention, preventing traffic accidents... etc., all of which should be done, and must be done by ourselves.
    For ourselves and for others, we must take on the responsibility of public security work.

    提起咱们国家现在的社会秩序，谁不说好？这些年来，反革命分子差不多都肃清了，社会上的新风气也慢慢养成了。拾金不昧，助老爱幼的新人新事真是说也说不完。难怪陈阿姨老是对人叨念：“现在社会就是太平。”可是，就因为太平，陈阿姨也说：“叫咱们居民帮助派出所搞治安工作，还有啥可搞的呀！咱们住户人家，只要自个不出事就行了，谁还有工夫去管别人？”
    陈阿姨这种想法，我觉得不对头。现在的社会秩序好，可也不等于连一个坏人都没有了哇！我们有时候不是还听说有流氓捣乱、小偷行窃、反革命分子进行破坏吗？这些都告诉我们，还有一些寄生虫和坏分子，不愿意悔悟，背着人们在那里偷偷摸摸地干着见不得人的勾当，让大伙儿吃亏受害。
    把这些坏家伙揪出来，不许他们胡作非为，当然是公安同志们的责任。但是，做好这个工作，咱们居民也有份。咱们的政府无论作什么事情，都离不了群众，治安工作，更是这样。因为坏分子们都是躲躲藏藏、鬼鬼祟祟的，要想发现他们，可不是十分容易的事。但是，如果咱们大伙都经心一些，那就好办多啦！就拿北京市来说，假若全市三百万居民都关心治安工作，咱们就有了三百万双眼睛来监视那些坏蛋，不怕他们怎么狡猾，终归逃不过我们三百万人的眼睛。
    帮助政府作治安工作，也不会费多大事。因为谁都熟习自己的街坊，如果在我们的左近忽然有了形迹可疑的人是很容易看出来的。只要我们把看到的情况立即向派出所报告，也就是帮助政府作了治安工作。当然，治安工作决不止这一件，比如防火、防盗、防止发生交通事故……等，都是应该作，而且也是必须由我们自己动手来作的。
    为了自己，也为了别人，咱们可要好好担当起治安工作的责任。
