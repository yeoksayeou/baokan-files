Xinhua News Agency, Ulaanbaatar, 12th -- The working people of Ulaanbaatar held a farewell meeting at the railway station here this afternoon to see off the first group of Chinese employees who have completed their construction period in the Mongolian People's Republic and are returning home.

Mongolian Party and government leaders Baljinniam, Tsende, Damdin, Lamqin, and Dugersuren attended the farewell meeting.

Workers from both countries bid farewell to each other cordially at the station, exchanged gifts, shook hands repeatedly, and many shed tears.

Mongolian Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Dugersuren said at the farewell meeting that the Chinese government had sent technical staff to help develop Mongolia's national economy, which the Mongolian people considered an internationalist assistance from brotherly people, and expressed sincere gratitude. He said that for three years, Chinese workers have worked in more than 200 enterprises in Mongolia, such as factories and farms, demonstrating a high degree of initiative and overfulfilling production tasks. The diligence of Chinese workers has left an indelible impression on Mongolian workers.

Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia He Ying said at the meeting that Chinese employees, entrusted by the motherland, participated in Mongolia's socialist construction, which is a glorious thing. He asked the returning employees to bring back and convey to the people of the motherland the examples of the care and consideration of the Mongolian government and people and their deep feelings for the Chinese people.

Representatives of Mongolian and Chinese workers also spoke at the meeting.
