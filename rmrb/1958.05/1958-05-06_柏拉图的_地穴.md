    Plato's "Cave"
    Zhang Pei
    Plato's famous book "The Republic" contains a well-known "Allegory of the Cave."

    He said, imagine a cave in which countless people are living. Their heads and feet are chained so that they can neither move freely nor turn to look around. Above and behind them, a fire is burning at a distance. Between the fire and the prisoners, there is a raised walkway, bordered by a low wall. In this way, these prisoners can only see the shadows of figures moving along the wall, cast by the fire onto the wall of the cave in front of them, like watching a puppet show. Because these people have never seen real things in sunlight, they completely believe in the reality of the shadows. If one of these prisoners were freed and came out of the cave, he would find the great light very painful, even though he had gained freedom. He would believe that the light and real things are no more comfortable or lovely than the shadows. He would believe in the reality of the shadows, until he recognizes and becomes accustomed to the truth of all things.

    This "cave" is used by Plato, through the mouth of Socrates, to ridicule those who fear the truth and are content with error and ignorance.

    Plato's so-called "truth" is deceptive; his objective idealist "truth" is only the firelight in the "cave," not the sunlight. However, Plato's "cave" also depicts the reality of ideological rule in class society. In fact, in the old society, in capitalist countries, there were plenty of such "caves" and people wearing ideological shackles.

    In these "caves," the ideological "firelight" of the bourgeoisie shines: there is Plato, and also Nietzsche; there is Mach, and also Dewey; there are also Russell, Wittgenstein, Carnap, Ayer, and other birds of a feather... People wear the chains of "selfishness" and the shackles of "personal fame and gain." Because there is no sunlight, they cannot distinguish between black and white, let alone between friend and foe.

    Old "veterans" of the old society, who can avoid being shocked and filled with emotion when they see this "cave"? How many of us, over the long years, relied on the great help of the Party and comrades, and after our own arduous struggles, finally broke free from the shackles and crawled out of the "cave"?

    However, regrettably, not everyone has gained freedom. It turns out that this invisible "cave" is neither in heaven nor in the depths, but in the depths of people's souls. Therefore, even today, bourgeois ideology, scholarship, and even the concept of personal fame and gain, still "haunt" some old intellectuals.

    Some people cling to the ideological remnants of various bourgeois scholars and are unwilling to give them up, or are even unwilling to touch them with the hand of "criticism." Some people want to desert when assigned to work they don't like, and are unwilling to work on research topics that don't match their personal interests. It is best to work alone, probably for fear of "leaking" their "secrets," so although they work in the same room, they never interact with each other. When writing a paper collectively, they must first discuss who is listed first, and they bring fewer apprentices to avoid hindering their writing and reducing their royalties. Teaching and research are said to be an "irreconcilable contradiction," and for the sake of "one-bookism," it is best to reduce the number of classes they teach. ... In short, bourgeois ideology and scholarship are very important, personal fame and gain come first, and socialist construction is a "damn nuisance."

    In this way, they are far away from the socialist direction of being "red and expert," "catching up with the advanced international scientific level in twelve years," and being "more, faster, better, and more economical."

    However, the motherland is leaping forward at an incredible pace. Industry is advancing towards the technical barrier, and agriculture is advancing towards the water conservancy barrier. A technological revolution in production is budding and emerging. In such an era, whoever does not leap forward will fall off the chariot of history; if anyone is still not determined to climb out of Plato's "cave," then they must plan to be buried there forever.

    In the midst of the great leap forward in thought, let me bless those who are still in Plato's "cave," those whose bourgeois ideological shackles are loosened but not yet removed, those who are still a little afraid of the sunlight and are peeking out at the "cave" entrance, to quickly make a "leap" of "reforming themselves." By doing so, what will be lost is the "cave" and the shackles, and what will be gained will be the great liberation of communist thought.

### 柏拉图的“地穴”

    柏拉图的“地穴”
    章沛
    柏拉图的名著“理想国”中，有这样一个有名的“地穴之喻”。
    他说，试设想在一个地穴中，有着无数的人。他们的头和脚都有锁链锁住，既不能自由行动，也不能自由转动，向四旁顾盼。在他们的后上方，有着掩映的火光照耀，但相距很远。在火与人之间，有一条凸起的过道，围以矮墙。这样，这些囚徒就只能看到矮墙上的人映射在地穴对面墙上的活动的影像，有如看傀儡戏。由于这些人从来没看过阳光下的真实东西，他们也就完全相信影像的真实。假如其中有一个囚人获得释放，出了地穴，那时，他虽然得到自由，但对巨大的光明将感到非常痛苦。他将相信，光明与真实的东西，并不比影像更舒适可爱。他将相信影像的真实，直等到他认识和习惯了一切事物真相。
    这个“地穴”，是柏拉图借了苏格拉底的嘴巴用来嘲笑那些害怕真理，安于错误和愚昧的人的。
    柏拉图的所谓“真理”是骗人的，他的客观唯心主义的“真理”只是“地穴”中的火光，绝不是阳光。不过，柏拉图的“地穴”却也画出了阶级社会中的思想统治的实际。说实在，在旧社会，在资本主义国家，这样的“地穴”，这样的戴着思想镣铐的人们有的是。
    在这些“地穴”中，闪耀的是资产阶级的思想“火光”：有柏拉图，也有尼采；有马赫，也有杜威；也有着罗素，维特根施坦，卡尔纳普，爱丘尔等等一丘之貉。……人们带着“自私自利”的锁链，带着“个人名利”的镣铐。因为没有阳光，所以分不清黑白，更分不出敌我。
    旧社会的“过来人”，看到这个“地穴”，谁又能免于触目惊心，感慨系之呢？我们多少人是在漫长的岁月里，倚靠了党和同志们的大力帮助，经过自己的艰苦搏斗，才最后挣脱了镣铐，钻出了“地穴”的。
    然而，可惜的是，并不是每一个人都获得了自由。原来这个无形的“地穴”上不在天，下不在泉，却在人的灵魂深处。因此直到今天，资产阶级的思想、学术，以致个人名利观念，也还会“阴魂不散”地缠在某些旧知识分子身上。
    有人死抱住各式各样的资产阶级学者的思想残骸不愿放弃，或者还不愿意用“批评”的手去碰一碰。有人分配到不高兴干的工作要开小差，碰到与个人兴趣不符的研究题目就不愿动手。工作最好单干，大概是怕“泄漏”了自己的“天机”，因此虽然在一室办公，但却老死不相往来。集体写论文要先谈好谁排头名，徒弟少带以免妨碍写作，减少稿费收入。教学与研究据说是“不可调和的矛盾”，为了“一本书主义”，最好少担课。……总而言之，资产阶级思想、学术很重，个人名利第一，社会主义建设大事“管他娘”。
    这样一来，离开“红透专深”“十二年赶上国际科学先进水平”“多快好省”等等社会主义方向也就十万八千里了。
    然而，祖国在一日千里地跃进。工业正向技术关大进军，农业正向水利关大进军。生产中的技术革命在萌芽、冒头。在这样一个年代，谁不跃进谁就要从历史的车子上栽下来；如果谁还不下决心爬出柏拉图的“地穴”，那谁就得打算永远葬身在那里。
    在思想大跃进当中，让我祝福那些尚留在柏拉图的“地穴”中的人们，那些资产阶级思想镣铐已松未脱的人们，那些还有点害怕阳光而在“地穴”口探头探脑的人们，赶快进行“脱胎换骨”的“一跃”吧。这样做，失去的是“地穴”和镣铐，得到的将是共产主义思想大解放。
