    A Medicine for Fattening Pigs
    Teachers at Lanzhou Agricultural School recently successfully tested a method of fattening pigs with medicine. They used two pigs with identical conditions, one of which was fed 0.5 grams of a powder made of methylthiouracil and rhubarb daily, and the other was not fed methylthiouracil. After three weighings, the pig fed the medicine gained an average of one jin, five liang, and eight qian per day, while the one not fed the medicine gained twelve liang and eight qian, a difference of nine liang. The comrades in charge of the research are now summarizing and evaluating the results in order to promote the method comprehensively. (Lu Zenrong)

    一种肥猪的药物
    兰州农校教师最近试验成功了一种用药物肥猪的方法。他们用两只条件完全相同的猪，一只每日喂甲基硫氧嘧啶和大黄混合制成的粉剂0.5克，一只不喂甲基硫氧嘧啶，经过三次称重，喂药猪每日平均增重一斤五两八钱，不喂药的增长十二两八钱，相差九两。现在负责研究的同志正在总结、鉴定，以便全面推广。　（卢增荣）
