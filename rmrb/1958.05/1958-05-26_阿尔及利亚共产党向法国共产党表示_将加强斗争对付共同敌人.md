Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 24th: TASS reports that the General Secretary of the Algerian Communist Party, Larbi Bouhali, sent a telegram to the leadership of the French Communist Party. The telegram emphasizes that the recent events in Algeria "clearly demonstrate that extreme colonialists are the common enemy of our two peoples, and our two peoples should strengthen their fighting front to deal with them."

Bouhali said, "As for the Algerian people, the coup launched by extreme colonialists and fascists in Algeria cannot stop their struggle for liberation. On the contrary, this will prompt the Algerian people to redouble their efforts to achieve national liberation as soon as possible, for which they have shed so much blood."

    将加强斗争对付共同敌人
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社巴黎24日讯：阿尔及利亚共产党总书记拉比·布哈利打电报给法国共产党领导机构。电报着重指出，阿尔及利亚的最近事件“鲜明地表明，极端殖民主义者是我们两国人民的共同敌人，我们两国人民应当加强自己的斗争战线来对付他们”。
    布哈利说，“至于阿尔及利亚人民，极端殖民主义者和法西斯分子在阿尔及利亚所发动的政变是决不能阻挡他们的解放斗争的。相反地，这将促使阿尔及利亚人民加倍努力，争取早日获得民族解放，为了民族解放，他们已经流了这末多鲜血。”
