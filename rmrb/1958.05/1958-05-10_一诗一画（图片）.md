    Poem and Painting
    Poem by Deng Tuo, Painting by Ye Qianyu
    Southern scenery, bright and clear sky,
    The first ripe bananas herald a bumper year.
    Does A-nong's heart's desire reach the ears of her love?
    Amidst the lush greenery, she envies not the immortals.

    邓拓诗  叶浅予画
    南国风光爽朗天，香蕉初熟兆丰年。
    阿侬心事郎知否？万绿丛中不羡仙。
