    Strengthening Theoretical Teaching
    Chongqing Schools Combine Theoretical Education with Political Work

    (Our report) Since the beginning of this year, higher and secondary schools in Chongqing Municipality have emphasized improving the quality of Marxist-Leninist theoretical education.

    Party organizations in universities and colleges such as Chongqing University, Southwest University of Political Science and Law, and Southwest Normal University have strengthened their specific leadership over the theoretical teaching of the History of the Communist Party of China, philosophy, and political economy. In addition to assigning responsibilities to the teaching and research sections, the leading comrades of the Party committee of the Southwest University of Political Science and Law, including the president and the Party secretary, personally lecture on the History of the Communist Party of China and philosophy. The Party secretary of Southwest Normal University is also stepping up preparations to personally lecture on political economy.

    Chongqing University and Southwest University of Political Science and Law also combine theoretical education with political and ideological work to conduct teaching in light of the students' actual thinking. The theoretical instructors in these two schools have left their offices and gone deep among the students. Chongqing University has assigned theoretical instructors to serve as deputy secretaries of various levels of the Communist Youth League in the departments and classes. At the same time, it is also training full-time Party branch secretaries of various departments and Party member cadres in the Party committees and personnel departments who are engaged in socialist ideological education, striving to have them teach theoretical courses after two years. In this way, teachers who are assigned teaching tasks can manage both teaching and people, and manage both theory and ideology.

    More than 100 middle schools and secondary vocational schools in Chongqing have also sent more than 200 political teachers in batches to short-term training courses specially run by the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee's Primary Party School for further study. The first batch of more than 100 political teachers who are currently studying have already begun to study documents such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People."

    加强理论教学工作
    重庆各学校把理论教育和政治工作结合起来
    本报讯　今年以来，重庆市的高等、中等学校重视提高马列主义理论教育的教学质量。
    重庆大学、西南政法学院和西南师范学院等大、专学校的党组织都加强了对中国共产党党史、哲学、政治经济学等理论教学工作的具体领导。西南政法学院的党委负责人除分工领导教研室外，院长和党委书记都亲自担任中共党史和哲学的讲授。西南师范学院党委书记也在加紧备课，准备亲自讲授政治经济学。
    重庆大学和西南政法学院还将理论教育与政治思想工作结合，以便针对学生的思想实际进行教学。这两所学校的理论教员走出了办公室，深入到学生中去。重庆大学一方面把理论教员下放到系、班去担任各级团组织的副书记，一方面也将各系专职的党总支书记和党委、人事部门做社会主义思想教育工作的党员干部进行培养，争取两年以后讲授理论课。这样，担任教学任务的教师，可以做到既管教学又管人，既管理论又管思想了。
    重庆市百多所中学和中等专业学校也把二百多名政治课教师分批送到中共重庆市委初级党校专门举办的短期训练班去进修。第一批正在进修的百多个政治课教师，已经开始学习“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾问题”等文件。
