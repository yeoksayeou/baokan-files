    North China and Inner Mongolia Regions
    Forestry Scientific Research Forms a Collaborative Network
    (Reported by this newspaper) A large-scale collaborative network for forestry scientific research has been formed in North China and Inner Mongolia.

    The Institute of Forestry Science of the Ministry of Forestry, the Institute of Forest Industry Science, and the Inner Mongolia Institute of Forestry Science are at the core of this collaboration. Research units of agricultural departments (bureaus) in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan, and Inner Mongolia, as well as relevant researchers from higher agricultural colleges, are participating in the collaboration. Relevant researchers from the Institute of Microbiology, Institute of Entomology, Institute of Geography, Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Peking University will also provide assistance to varying degrees.

    This collaboration was formed after the Rectification Campaign and the criticism of bourgeois individualism. In the past, the aforementioned research units did not communicate with each other. Often, everyone would work on the same research topic, which dispersed and counteracted efforts, hindering the development of the forestry science endeavor.

    This collaboration has concrete organization and plans. Specific measures have been formulated for determining future research plans and publishing research results. The forestry scientific research topics in North China and Inner Mongolia are divided into "Mountain Afforestation," "Fast-Growing Tree Species such as Poplar," "Forestry Pests and Diseases," "Forest Tending," and "Forest Tree Seeds and Seedling Raising." They have organized collaboration in these five areas and have already drafted the collaborative content and plans for 1958.

    华北和内蒙古地区
    林业科学研究形成协作网
    本报讯　一个大协作的林业科学研究网在华北和内蒙古地区形成。
    林业部的林业科学研究所、森林工业科学研究所和内蒙古林业科学研究所是这一协作的核心，河北、山西、山东、河南、内蒙古地区的农业厅（局）的研究单位和高等农业院校的有关研究人员都参加协作，还有中国科学院真菌研究所、昆虫研究所、地理研究所、有机化学研究所和北京大学等的有关研究人员也将程度不同地给以帮助。
    这一协作是经过整风运动、批判资产阶级个人主义以后形成的。过去，上述各研究单位互不通气，往往同一研究题目大家都搞，既分散了力量又抵消了力量，障碍着林业科学事业的发展。
    他们的这一协作有具体的组织和计划，对今后研究计划的确定和研究成果的发表，都制定了具体办法。华北、内蒙古地区的林业科学研究课题计分“山地造林”、“杨树等速生树种”、“林业病虫害”、“森林抚育”、“林木种子和育苗”，他们就这五个方面组织协作，并已拟定了1958年的协作内容和计划。
