　　Transporting Fertilizer to the Fields in Advance
    Anhui Farmers Devise Many Effective Methods
    (Our dispatch from Hefei, May 15th) How to transport the large amount of fertilizer that has been accumulated in a timely manner to the fields? This is an important problem existing in the fertilizer accumulation movement in Anhui Province. Now, Anhui farmers are enthusiastically carrying out a "strive by all means to send fertilizer to the fields" campaign.
    The enthusiasm of Anhui Province's farmers for accumulating fertilizer this year is very high. As of the 7th, the province had accumulated 115 billion dan of fertilizer, which is 18 times more than the total amount of fertilizer accumulated in the province last year. Calculated based on the province's cultivated land area, the average is 1,300 dan per mu, which has reached the requirement of "1,000 dan of fertilizer per mu" proposed by the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party this year. However, most of this fertilizer has not been transported to the fields. In front of and behind the houses of agricultural cooperatives, fertilizer is piled up like mountains. According to the calculation of Anqing Prefecture, if the fertilizer to be transported is carried to the fields by manpower, even if all manpower is mobilized, it would take two months to complete the task, which would delay the farming season. Therefore, how to actively think of ways to transport fertilizer to the fields is a very urgent task at present.
    Party and government leading departments at all levels in Anhui Province attach great importance to this issue. Various localities have mobilized the masses to come up with many methods to improve the efficiency of fertilizer transportation. The measures taken by various localities mainly include the following points: First, improve and utilize all possible tools to put them into fertilizer transportation work. Anqing Prefecture put forward the slogan "fertilizer transportation should be vehicular" and launched a tool reform movement. Bengbu and Fuyang Prefectures put the tools created in water management into fertilizer transportation. Agricultural cooperatives near rivers also widely use tugboats, mud rafts, and grain buckets to transport fertilizer by water. These tools are generally two or more times more efficient than carrying by people. Second, when transporting fertilizer, queue up different crops and different distance plots, and make unified arrangements. The specific methods are: transport near fields first, then transport far fields; send coarse fertilizer to near fields, and send fine fertilizer to far fields; transport early rice fields first, then transport mid-season rice fields. Using this method not only ensures that the farming season is not missed, but also saves labor. Third, cooperation is carried out between societies and between teams. The method of cooperation is to exchange distant land for nearby land, and exchange fertilizer transportation. Huangbang Society in Tongcheng County adopted this method, saving more than 6,000 workdays in more than ten days. Fourth, rationally allocate tasks, adopt quantitative assessment based on the number of people, and remuneration based on the amount.
    Due to the adoption of the above effective measures, the speed of fertilizer transportation in various places has been greatly accelerated compared with the past. As of the 7th, more than 37 billion dan of fertilizer recently accumulated in the three prefectures of Anqing, Lu'an, and Wuhu have been transported to the fields. The fertilizer transported to the fields in Anqing Prefecture has accounted for 90% of the accumulated fertilizer.

　　提前把肥料运到田里
    安徽农民想出许多有效办法
    本报合肥15日电  如何把已经积好的大量肥料，及时的运到田里？这是安徽省积肥运动中存在的一个重要问题。现在，安徽农民正热烈开展“千方百计送肥下田”的突击运动。
    安徽省农民今年积肥劲头非常大，到7日止，全省已经积肥一千一百五十亿担，比去年全省积肥量多十八倍。以全省耕地面积计算，平均每亩合一千三百担，已经达到中共安徽省委今年提出的“每亩千担肥”的要求。但是这些肥料大部分未运送下田。在农业社的庄前屋后，肥料堆积如山。据安庆专区的计算，如把待运的肥料用人力挑运下田，即使动员全部人力，也得两个月才能运完，这就会耽误农时了。因此，如何积极地想办法把肥料送到田里，是当前十分紧迫的任务。
    安徽省各级党政领导部门十分重视这个问题。各地都发动群众想出很多办法，提高了运肥效率。各地采取的措施，主要有以下几点：第一，改进和利用一切可能利用的工具投入运肥工作。安庆专区提出“运肥车子化”的口号，并开展了改革工具运动。蚌埠、阜阳专区把治水中创造的工具，投入运肥。靠近河道的农业社，还广泛用拖船、泥簰、禾桶等工具，从水路运输。这些工具一般比人挑人抬效率提高两倍以上。第二，在运肥时，对不同作物，不同距离的田块进行排队，统一安排。具体的做法是：先运近田，后运远田；粗肥送近田，细肥送远田；先运早稻田，后运中稻田。利用这个办法，不仅保证不误农时，还节省了劳力。第三，社与社、队与队之间进行协作。协作的办法是以远地换近地，调换运肥。桐城县黄磅社采用这个办法，十多天内节省六千多个工。第四，合理分配任务，采用按人定量，按量定酬。
    由于采用以上有效措施，各地运肥速度比过去大大加快。到7日止，安庆、六安、芜湖三个专区最近所积的肥料已有三百七十多亿担运送下田。安庆专区运到田里的肥料已占积肥数的90％。
