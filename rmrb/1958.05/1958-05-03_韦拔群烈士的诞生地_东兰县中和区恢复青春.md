    The Rebirth of Zhonghe District, Donglan County, the Birthplace of Martyr Wei Baqun
    Zhonghe District in Donglan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is the birthplace of the Zhuang people's revolutionary leader Wei Baqun, and also the source of the Youjiang Peasant Revolutionary Movement. As early as 1935, the Zhuang people, under the leadership of Wei Baqun, began to fight against feudal forces. After the Red Seventh Army went north, the people of Zhonghe District suffered severe devastation. However, the Zhuang people did not succumb; they dispersed into the deep mountains and forests and persisted in fighting the enemy.
    After liberation, the Zhuang people marched forward with vigorous steps in the direction pointed out by the Party, carrying forward the glorious revolutionary tradition of hard struggle, and rebuilt their beautiful homeland on the ruins.

    韦拔群烈士的诞生地
    东兰县中和区恢复青春
    广西僮族自治区东兰县中和区，是僮族人民革命领袖韦拔群烈士的诞生地，也是右江农民革命运动的策源地。早在1935年僮族人民就在韦拔群的领导下开始同封建势力展开了斗争。红七军北上后，中和区人民遭受了严重的摧残。可是僮族人民并没有屈服，他们分散于深山密林中，坚持同敌人进行斗争。
    解放后，僮族人民以矫健的步伐朝着党指引的方向前进，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命光荣传统，在废墟上重建起自己美好的家园。
