Xinhua News Agency, 7th Dispatch: “Vigorously develop rural mass cultural activities centered on clubs, and basically achieve that every agricultural production cooperative has a club within one to two years, attracting the broad masses to participate in cultural activities.” This is the work goal put forward at the National Rural Mass Culture and Art Work Conference.

This conference, based on the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, discussed the development plan for rural cultural work, clarified the tasks and practices of rural mass cultural work, and exchanged experiences in rural mass cultural work from various places.

The conference pointed out that rural mass cultural work centered on clubs must be closely integrated with political tasks, production, and central work, and truly achieve that culture goes wherever production goes; the more tense the production, the more active the culture. Rural cultural work should become a broad sense of cultural propaganda work, closely cooperating with agricultural technology, science popularization, literacy campaigns, eliminating the four pests, sports, and other tasks. Clubs should become comprehensive organizations for propaganda and cultural work in rural areas, assistants to the Party and government in propaganda and cultural work, and a garden for farmers' amateur cultural and recreational activities. Clubs should have organizations suitable for production situations, such as propaganda, newspaper reading, books, science and technology popularization, singing, exhibitions, slideshow projections, broadcasting, amateur theater troupes, entertainment, and sports. Activities should be carried out based on the principles of flexibility, diversity, and small-scale as the mainstay, and larger-scale activities can also be held as needed and as possible, under the principle of not hindering production.

The conference believes that developing mass amateur artistic creation and cultivating a large number of artistic talents from workers and peasants is one of the fundamental plans for building socialist culture. The conference requires that each club establish a creation group within one to two years and encourage them to use local materials, write and perform locally, to develop mass amateur creation activities and cultivate the cultural teams of the workers and peasants themselves. At the same time, mass art galleries, cultural centers (stations), cultural service teams, and clubs should pay attention to discovering the national and folk artistic heritage, and select and sort them out. Mass art galleries in various places must strengthen the guidance work for mass art activities, and the staff of mass art galleries must go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Cultural and art schools at all levels, art cadre schools, and professional cultural and art groups should also systematically help mass cultural organizations cultivate artistic backbones and activists. When cadres of professional cultural and art groups go down to the countryside to perform, they must first be students of the masses, and then teachers.

The conference pointed out that the popularization of culture must fully rely on the masses, so as to implement the line of building socialist culture in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. With the development of industry and agriculture, it is necessary to develop private cultural undertakings as much as possible and mobilize the positive factors of all parties to popularize culture. Privately-run cultural centers (stations), privately-run libraries, privately-run film projection teams, etc., can be tried out in various places. Running rural clubs should strive for diligence and thrift, advocate making do with whatever is available, starting from scratch, and gradually improving; the scale can be large or small, the content can be complex or simple, and gradually improve as production develops and the income of agricultural cooperatives increases.

Representatives of many local party committees attending the meeting introduced their experiences in leading cultural work. Their experience proves that the party committee's attention and strengthened leadership is the fundamental guarantee for doing a good job in rural mass cultural work. The main experiences of these local party committees in leading rural cultural work are: the secretary takes the lead, the whole party takes action, and puts cultural work on the party's work agenda for comprehensive arrangements. This conference was held in Beijing from April 20th to 30th.

    生产越紧张　文化越活跃
    农村群众文化工作会议提出要求
    新华社7日讯　“大力发展以俱乐部为中心的农村群众文化活动，在一两年内，基本上达到每个农业生产合作社都有俱乐部，吸引广大群众参加文化活动。”这是在全国农村群众文化艺术工作会议上提出的工作目标。
    这次会议，根据生产大跃进的新形势，讨论了农村文化工作的发展规划，明确了农村群众文化工作的任务和作法，并且交流了各地农村群众文化工作的经验。
    会议指出，以俱乐部为中心的农村群众文化工作，必须紧紧地结合政治任务、结合生产、结合中心工作，真正做到生产到那里，文化到那里；生产越紧张，文化越活跃。农村文化工作要成为广义的文化宣传工作，同农业技术、科学普及、扫盲、除四害、体育等各种工作密切配合。俱乐部应当成为农村中宣传、文化工作的综合性组织。成为党和政府在宣传、文化工作方面的助手和农民在业余文化娱乐活动的园地。俱乐部应当有适合生产情况的宣传、读报、图书、科学技术普及、歌咏、展览、幻灯放映、广播、业余剧团、文娱、体育等组织。开展活动应根据灵活多样、小型为主的原则，也可以视需要和可能，在不妨碍生产的原则下，举行较大规模的活动。
    会议认为，发展群众业余文艺创作，从工农当中培养大量的文艺人才，是建设社会主义文化的根本大计之一。会议要求，一两年内每个俱乐部都要成立创作组，并推动他们就地取材，就地编写，就地演唱，以发展群众的业余创作活动，培养工农群众自己的文化队伍。同时，群众艺术馆、文化馆（站）、文化服务队和俱乐部都要注意发掘民族的、民间的文艺遗产，加以选择和整理。各地群众艺术馆必须加强对群众艺术活动的辅导工作，群众艺术馆工作人员必须深入工农兵。各级文化艺术学校、艺术干部学校、文化艺术的专业团体，也应当有计划地帮助群众文化组织培养艺术骨干和活动分子。文化艺术专业团体的干部下放和下乡演出时，首先要当群众的学生，再当先生。
    会议指出，普及文化必须充分依靠群众，这才能贯彻多快好省地建设社会主义文化的路线。随着工农业的发展，要尽可能地发展民办文化事业，调动各方面的积极因素来普及文化。民办文化馆（站）、民办图书馆、民办放映队等，各地都可以试办。办农村俱乐部应当力求勤俭，提倡因陋就简，从无到有，从有到好；规模可大可小，内容可繁可简，随着生产的发展和农业社收入的增加，再逐步提高。
    出席会议的不少地方党委的代表介绍了领导文化工作的经验。他们的经验证明，党委重视和加强领导是做好农村群众文化工作的根本保证。这些地方党委领导农村文化工作的主要经验是：书记挂帅，全党动手，并把文化工作列入党的工作日程上来，全面安排。这次会议是4月20日到30日在北京举行的。
