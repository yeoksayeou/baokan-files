    Generalization, Standardization, and Serialization
    Generalization: In several similar machines, such as various machine tools, some parts have similar shapes, sizes, and functions, such as gears, shafts, and bearings. Making them the same allows them to be installed on this lathe or fitted on a milling machine. This process of unifying parts is called generalization. Its scope of generalization is often within a certain type of similar machine or products manufactured by a department.
    Standardization: Some machine parts have a very wide range of use, such as screws and ball bearings, which can be used not only in certain machines but also in various products. These parts are usually manufactured according to certain specifications in a country or many countries, which is called standardization.
    Serialization: In the same type of machine, arranging them in the most reasonable order according to the numerical values of their main performance is called serialization. For example, steam turbines are manufactured in different sizes of 6,000 kW, 12,000 kW, 25,000 kW, 50,000 kW... which can basically meet the needs of various power sizes, and there is no need to manufacture steam turbines with special capacities such as 7,500 kW.
    Generalization, standardization, and serialization can all simplify the technological process in production and facilitate large-scale machine production.

    通用化、标准化和系列化
    通用化：在几种相近的机器，如各种工作母机中，有些零件的形状、大小和作用很相似，如齿轮、轴、轴承等，把它们制成一样的，可以安在这种车床上，也可以配在铣床上。这种零件统一的过程，就叫通用化。它的通用范围，经常都是在某种类似的机器中，或者一个部门所制造的产品中。
    标准化：有一些机器零件，使用的范围非常广泛，如螺丝、滚珠等，不仅在某些机器中、而且在各种产品中都可以使用。通常在一个国家或许多国家都按照一定的规格制造这些零件，这就叫做标准化。
    系列化：在同一类机器中，按照它们的主要性能的数值最合理的排列起来，就叫做系列化。例如，汽轮机，按六千瓩、一万二千瓩、二万五千瓩、五万瓩……的不同大小制造，基本可以满足各种大小动力的需要，而可以不需要制造像七千五百瓩这种特别容量的汽轮机了。
    通用化、标准化和系列化，都可以简化生产中的工艺过程，便于大规模机器生产。
