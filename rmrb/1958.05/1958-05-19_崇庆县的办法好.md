Chongqing County's Method is Good

　　This newspaper reports that Sichuan Province's Chongqing County is doing a good job in building small-scale hydroelectric power stations. By the end of 1957, the capacity of small-scale power stations in Chongqing County had reached 332 kilowatts (excluding power stations owned by farms and factories). In 1958, the plan is to develop 31 hydroelectric power stations with a capacity of 285 kilowatts, and 18 hydraulic power stations with an output of 275 horsepower.

　　Chongqing County's method of building stations is to proceed in two steps. First, build hydraulic power stations (i.e., water turbines directly driving rice milling machines) to accumulate a certain amount of capital, and then build power stations. This is because the cost of building a hydraulic power station with the same capacity is generally about four-fifths lower than that of a hydroelectric power station, which is suitable for the current economic conditions in rural areas and helps accumulate capital for building power stations.

　　In the process of building power stations, Chongqing County adopted the method of making do with whatever is available and using local materials. The wood, bamboo, and pebbles needed for building the stations are all taken from the local area. The water turbines are all made of wood by the communes themselves, costing only about 70 yuan each, including labor and materials. The construction time is short. Generally, it only takes about a month from the start of construction to completion and commissioning.

　　These hydroelectric and hydraulic power stations have had very good results.

　　First, they can increase the income of the state, cooperatives, and commune members. In 1957, the six state-owned hydroelectric power stations in Chongqing County turned over more than 80,000 yuan in profits to the state. The hydroelectric and hydraulic power stations of the Shengli Cooperative in Anle Township had a net income of 9,881 yuan last year, which is equal to three times the investment in the station. Cooperatives with hydroelectric and hydraulic power stations generally have by-product income that is three to five times higher than that of cooperatives without hydroelectric or hydraulic power stations. The Shengli Cooperative in Yuantong Township borrowed money from the state every year before the construction of the station and did not distribute cash dividends. Last year, it built an 18-horsepower hydraulic power station, and the income generated was used to repay debts, purchase fertilizers, and distribute 2,139 yuan in cash to the commune members.

　　Second, the hydraulic power station drives the rice milling machine to process rice, which yields two more jin per hundred jin than water mills. The county can produce 4.68 million more jin of rice per year.

　　Third, there is no need to use oil for lighting. 320 electric lights have been installed in Anle Township, which can save 5,760 jin of kerosene per year.

### 崇庆县的办法好

　　崇庆县的办法好
    本报讯　四川省崇庆县小型水电站办得好。到1957年底，崇庆县的小型发电站容量已有三百三十二瓩（不包括农场和工厂自备电站）。1958年计划要发展水电站三十一处，容量二百八十五瓩；水力站十八处，出力二百七十五马力。
    崇庆县建站的办法是分两步走，先搞水力站（即水轮机直接带动打米机工作），积累了一定资金以后，再搞发电站。这样做是因为：建设一个同样能力的水力站造价一般要比水电站约低五分之四，适合目前农村的经济条件，为建立电站积累资金。
    在建立电站过程中，崇庆县采取了因陋就简、就地取材的办法。建站所需的木材、竹和卵石等都是取自当地。水轮机全是由社里用木材自制的，连工带料一部只要七十元左右。建站时间短，一般从开工到建成投入运转，一共只需一个月左右。
    这些水电站和水力站收到的效果很好。
    第一，可以增加国家、合作社和社员的收入。崇庆县的六个国营水电站1957年上交国家的利润就有八万多元。安乐乡胜利社的水电站和水力站去年纯收益共达九千八百八十一元，等于建站投资的三倍。有水电站和水力站的合作社；副业收入一般要比没有水电站或水力站的合作社多三、五倍以上。元通乡胜利社，建站前年年向国家借钱，没有进行现金分配；去年建了一个十八马力的水力站，所得收入除了偿还债务、购买肥料以外，还拿出二千一百三十九元现金分给社员。
    第二，水力站带动打米机加工稻谷，比水碾每一百斤多出二斤，全县一年加工的稻谷可多出米四百六十八万斤。
    第三，点灯不用油，安乐乡安了三百二十盏电灯，一年可以节省灯油五千七百六十斤。
