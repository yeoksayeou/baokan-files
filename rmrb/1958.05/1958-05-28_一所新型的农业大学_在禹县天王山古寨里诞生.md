    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 27th: A new type of agricultural university has been established by the masses in the ancient village on Tianwang Mountain in Yu County, Henan. The school's buildings are thirty-two stone cave dwellings, where more than one hundred teachers and students live. They hold classes in experimental fields, meetings in the open air, and use "stones as benches and thighs as tables." All teachers and students have sworn an oath: "Overcome difficulties and climb to the peak of science," to cultivate agricultural experts for the mountainous areas.
    The school has three majors: agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy, as well as a political course. The agriculture department has disciplines such as soil, cultivation, seed selection, fertilization, crop cultivation, and improved seed breeding; the water conservancy department has disciplines such as surveying, hydrology and meteorology, water conservancy soil, and soil structure; the forestry department is also divided into trees, forests, fruit tree cultivation, and logging. Learning adopts the principle of combining lectures with practice, adhering to the spirit of self-reliance in running the school, self-reliance in learning, self-reliance in labor, and self-creation of tools, simplifying everything and resolutely implementing the principle of diligence and frugality in running the school. The 140 mu of land allocated to them by the agricultural cooperative is both an experimental field and a source of livelihood. They strive to achieve complete self-sufficiency in the second half of this year.
    The students of this school are all graduates of senior and junior high schools, some of whom are heroes and models in mountain management and water control from last winter and this spring. The teachers include a Soviet-trained deputy doctoral candidate in water conservancy who was sent down here from the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and an assistant instructor from the Henan Agricultural College who was sent down. The subjects for the student entrance exam were: deep plowing of land and planting cotton. Filling out the school application form was done by writing big-character posters. A Communist Youth League member wrote on a big-character poster: "I didn't come to Tianwang Mountain for enjoyment, but to become thoroughly proficient, I want to use technology and my own hands to develop the mountainous areas." They plan to complete the main courses in agriculture, forestry, and water conservancy in two years. The Yu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has sent a group of stronger cadres to lead the school.

    一所新型的农业大学
    在禹县天王山古寨里诞生
    据新华社郑州27日电　河南禹县天王山上的古寨里，群众自办起一所新型的农业大学。这所学校的校舍是三十二间石窑洞，全校一百多名师生就住在里面。他们在试验田里上课，露天地里开会，“石头当凳子，大腿当桌子”。全体师生发出誓愿：“战胜艰难困苦，攀登科学高峰”，为山区培养农业专家。
    这所学校设有农、林、水利三门专业课程和一门政治课。农业系有土壤、耕作、选种、施肥、作物栽培、良种繁育等学科；水利系有测量、水文气象、水利土壤、水土结构等学科；林业系也分树木、森林、果木栽培、采伐等学科。学习采用讲课与实际相结合的原则，本着自己办学自己学、自己劳动养自己、自创工具自己用的精神，一切因陋就简，坚决贯彻勤俭办学的原则。农业社拨给他们的一百四十亩土地，又是试验田，又是生活来源。他们争取今年下半年，全部达到自供自给。
    这所学校的学生都是高初中毕业生，其中有些是去冬今春治山治水的英雄模范。教员是水利电力部下放到这里的一位留苏水利副博士和河南农学院的一位下放助教等。学生入学测验的科目是：深翻土地和种棉花。填写入校志愿表是采取写大字报的方法。有位共青团员在大字报上写着：“我不是为享受来天王山，是为红透专深，我要用技术和双手开发山区”。他们计划两年读完大学农、林、水利三方面的主要课程。中共禹县委员会已派一批较强的干部来领导这所学校。
