　　Leaping Spring, Booming Enthusiasm
　　——New Victories on the Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Front
    Wei Wenbo, Deputy Secretary of the Leading Group of Nine under the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for the Prevention and Control of Schistosomiasis
    There is a Gongzhou Lake in Huangmei County, Hubei Province, which people call "Ghost Lake." The lake covers an area of 2,800 mu. It is flooded in summer and land in winter, overgrown with weeds and snails everywhere. The people along the lake who planted crops, raised livestock, and went into the lake became emaciated, weak, and eventually died with swollen bellies. Twenty-two families died completely. People said there were "ghosts" in the lake, and they dared not produce in the lake or live by the lake, so they moved to other places. This is the origin of the name "Ghost Lake." In the past year and the year before, Huangmei County launched a schistosomiasis prevention and control campaign, plowing the lake land three times to eliminate snails and planting 840 mu of cotton. Because the land was fertile and no fertilizer was used, 220 mu produced as much as 240 jin of ginned cotton per mu per year. The "Ghost Lake" that had endangered people's lives for many years has now become a high-yielding field.

    This story illustrates the necessity and importance of eliminating schistosomiasis.

    What Immortals Can't Cure, the Communist Party Can
    In the twelve provinces and cities in China where schistosomiasis is prevalent, there are similar stories to Gongzhou Lake. Schistosomiasis, this fierce enemy, has killed countless people! In the past, people had tried methods, but they failed to stop the development of the disease, let alone eliminate it. Only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, with the full mobilization of the masses, was there the possibility of eliminating this fierce enemy. By the end of last year, fifteen counties and cities across the country had basically eliminated schistosomiasis. The masses said: "What immortals can't cure, the Communist Party can cure." After the elimination of schistosomiasis in these places, there were three major benefits: first, people's health was restored; second, production increased; and third, people's lives improved. It is truly a great thing for the country and the people!

    In the struggle to prevent and control schistosomiasis, we have always adhered to the Party Central Committee's policy of active prevention and control, adopted comprehensive measures, and resolutely implemented the principle of combining mass movements with science and technology. Some people always have this kind of superstition: China engaged in it for more than 20 years during the Kuomintang rule, and did not come up with anything; Japan engaged in it for decades, and did not eliminate it; scientists in other countries researched and researched, and could not come up with a good method. Can the Communist Party eliminate schistosomiasis? In the final analysis, they don't believe in the masses, and they don't believe in themselves. However, the new surge of schistosomiasis prevention and control that appeared in the countryside last winter and this spring gave them a vivid lesson. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of farmers studied the National Program for Agricultural Development, and after the rectification movement of great airing of views, great debates, people's minds were liberated, the communist spirit was greatly developed, selfless labor, enthusiasm soared, and thus an unprecedented schistosomiasis prevention and control campaign involving tens of millions of people was launched. This movement was truly magnificent, earth-shattering, unseen and unheard of. In Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, out of a total of 150,000 laborers, 120,000 were involved in the movement. Red flags flew everywhere during the day, and lights shone brightly at night. The magnificent slogans resounded across the fields: "Greet the sun early and wear the stars at night, work from dusk to late at night, our strength is greater than the mountains, our enthusiasm is hotter than fire, even if the river is like the ocean, pump it dry in three days and three nights, pump the river dry to eliminate snails, and resolutely eliminate big belly disease." The heroic people cannot be overwhelmed by any difficulties. Even in strong winds and heavy rain, the masses still put on raincoats, wore straw hats, and stepped on the muddy embankments, working and singing at the same time: "Wind and rain do not delay going to the battlefield, day and night are the same, small snails are the enemy, plowshares and iron shovels are our weapons." In many areas of the South, the water network is crisscrossed. Who would dare to imagine that they could pump all the rivers dry to eliminate snails? But in some places, they actually did it in entire counties and entire townships. In Wuhu County, Anhui Province, the area where snails were eliminated in the past two years was 50,000 square meters. This spring, they boosted their enthusiasm and eliminated snails in more than 2.6 million square meters in 18 days, achieving the goal of becoming a basically snail-free county. According to their speed of eliminating snails in the past two years, the workload of 18 days is equivalent to 104 years. This spring, the area of land where snails were buried with soil across the country has reached 1.2 billion square meters, which is equivalent to removing a four-inch-deep layer of topsoil from the entire province of Fujian. Thirty-two counties and cities and four hundred townships and towns across the country have achieved basic snail-free status. From Shanghai's perspective, some scientists and technicians once held skeptical attitudes or sang pessimistic tunes about eliminating snails, half-heartedly saying: "Eliminating snails is a matter for the distant future, it will not be achieved until our beards turn white."

    When the north wind was blowing and heavy snow was falling, the broad masses of the Western Suburbs District of Shanghai and the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai all started to bail out the river water. They shook their heads at the river water, thinking it was impossible to pump it dry; before long, they saw the riverbed exposed, dug up mud to accumulate fertilizer, and eliminated the snails, and they nodded their heads.

    Production puts on wings, promotes schistosomiasis prevention and control movement; victory in schistosomiasis prevention and control, production rides on an airplane
    Due to the widespread adoption of the three-person team, mobile stationing, and the promotion of the new method of three-day treatment, 350,000 patients have been treated this spring, almost catching up with the number treated in the entire previous year, and exceeding the number treated in the first half of last year. These vivid examples of mass prevention and control movements have also swept away all conservative ideas. In the past, some medical experts stubbornly clung to the 20-day long-course treatment method, insisting that "promoting the three-day short-course treatment method will cause more deaths." Through the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Schistosomiasis Research Committee and the Fourth National Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Conference last winter, adopting the methods of airing views, debating, and展开了 criticism and self-criticism, the sectarian sentiments, conservative ideas, personal authority ideas, and dogmatic ideological obstacles of certain experts were swept away, and thus the three-day treatment method was universally promoted this spring. It is shorter in time, treats more patients, costs less money, has a lower mortality rate, and is welcomed by the masses, forcing them to break with old rules and regulations.

    In this great battle, people's living habits have also changed. For example, in ethnic minority areas of Yunnan, the old habit of defecating in the wild has been changed, and excrement is managed to prevent the spread of schistosomiasis eggs. In Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture alone, 60,000 toilets were built in one month, achieving "every family has a toilet, every household has a pen." The masses' enthusiasm and diligence have accomplished many things that were previously considered impossible, truly achieving more, faster, better, and more economical results.

    Schistosomiasis prevention and control must be closely integrated with production. This experience has been proven once again by the booming prevention and control movement this spring, and has been further enriched. The masses said: "Production puts on wings, promotes schistosomiasis prevention and control movement; victory in schistosomiasis prevention and control, production rides on an airplane." This is the mutually beneficial relationship between production and schistosomiasis prevention and control. In many areas, the masses put forward the slogan of "one shot, three benefits" in terms of eliminating snails. One shot is: pumping the river dry; three benefits: one is digging mud to accumulate fertilizer, two is improving irrigation, and three is eliminating snails. In terms of managing excrement, they put forward the slogan of "one shot, five benefits." One shot is: managing excrement well; five benefits: one is accumulating more fertilizer, improving fertilizer efficiency, two is eliminating schistosomiasis eggs, three is eliminating flies, four is reducing gastrointestinal infectious diseases, and five is improving rural sanitation. This is not only beneficial to production, but also can be combined with the patriotic health movement, which has been enthusiastically responded to by the masses. They sing loudly: "To achieve a thousand jin of grain per mu, we must have more fertilizer and strong labor, work hard day and night to eliminate snails, control water, accumulate fertilizer, and have strong bodies." According to statistics from Hunan, Hubei, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces: In this prevention and control campaign, a total of 248,555,000 dan of fertilizer were accumulated, 586,260,000 cubic meters of water conservancy projects were built, and 708,897 mu of cultivated land were increased by combining land reclamation and snail elimination. These facts vividly illustrate: we must closely integrate with production, build water conservancy projects, and fully mobilize the masses to effectively do prevention and control work.

    Leaders take the lead to set an example, and the masses work together
    The great achievements of the large-scale mass prevention and control movement this spring also illustrate the necessity of putting politics in command, leaders taking the lead, and rectifying the prevention and control team. The five secretaries of the Xuancheng County Party Committee in Anhui Province all went out to participate in the war separately. In the past, it was "the masses do, the leaders watch," but this year it is "the leaders take the lead to set an example, and the masses work together." The broad masses of cadres are not only commanders of mass movements, but also combatants, inspectors, and technicians. The masses said: "Cadres are Guan Yu wielding his knife and riding his horse during the day, and Zhuge Liang offering advice and planning at night." They also said: "As long as your cadres can think of it, we can do it. If you hold up the ladder, we dare to go to heaven." In the past, many prevention and control cadres were divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. For example, some prevention and control cadres in Jinxian County, Jiangxi Province, did not go out in three situations: they did not go out when it was windy and rainy; they did not go out in the morning and evening; they did not go out when it was cold and hot. The masses said: Where did these "young masters" come from? The rectification movement reversed their unhealthy tendencies, and their ideological outlook and work style changed accordingly. They participated in production while grasping prevention and control work, working vigorously and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses, which was welcomed and supported by the masses. From this point of view, as long as our cadres take the suffering of the masses as their own suffering and the happiness of the masses as their own happiness, and cadres and the masses are integrated into one, infinite power can be generated, and nothing cannot be done.

    The victory on the schistosomiasis prevention and control front this spring is indeed an inspiring event. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, without the victory of the rectification movement, without the encouragement of the National Program for Agricultural Development, without the superiority of the cooperative organization, and without the policy of active prevention and control and the adoption of comprehensive measures, it would be unimaginable to have such a feat. But we must never be complacent and relax because of this. At present, some areas have already developed the idea of "almost," especially those areas that have basically eliminated snails and schistosomiasis. In fact, "basically" is not equal to completely. We must continue to work hard, repeatedly sweep, strike while the iron is hot, and achieve complete elimination in one go. This year, our combat goal is to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in 134 epidemic counties and cities, and some areas should achieve complete elimination, and we must also combine the prevention and treatment of malaria, filariasis, hookworm disease, etc. Compared with the existing achievements and this requirement, the distance is still far. At present, the prevention and control work in areas where schistosomiasis is epidemic can be divided into three categories: one is fast horses whipping, one is walking leisurely with the horse, and one is walking slowly after dismounting. Now the development of the movement is unbalanced. Only when the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become more advanced, can we create a climax of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced, so as to continuously promote the movement forward. Some people say: To engage in prevention and control movements, we must wait for the slack season in agriculture. This is an old view, dealing with old almanacs. In today's situation of great leap forward in production, where is the distinction between busy and slack seasons? We suggest that the Party committees at all levels in areas where schistosomiasis is epidemic incorporate prevention and control work into the production plans of cooperatives, and advocate "monthly arrangements, regular work, twelve months a year, no month is missed." One year of preparation, four years of combat, and two years of mopping up, to eliminate schistosomiasis wherever possible. This is the combat slogan put forward by the First National Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Conference. This year is the second year of the four-year battle, and also the first year of the three-year battle in the future. The first year of the three years determines the outcome, and this year is the most critical and decisive year. We must forge ahead courageously and eliminate this fierce enemy. Of course, this is something that our predecessors have never done. But the experience of two years of practice tells us that, especially under the impetus of the great leap forward this spring, the great power of the masses is even more evident. What difficulties cannot be overcome? In such a favorable opportunity, with such heroic people, why not whip the fast horse and leap forward? Let us take advantage of the east wind to raise the sails and ride the waves forward!

### 跃进的春天　沸腾的干劲——防治血吸虫病战线上的新胜利

　　跃进的春天　沸腾的干劲
　　——防治血吸虫病战线上的新胜利
    中共中央防治血吸虫病九人小组副书记　魏文伯
    湖北省黄梅县有个公洲湖，人们叫它“鬼湖”。全湖面积二千八百亩，夏水冬陆，杂草丛生，钉螺遍地。沿湖人民在湖内种过庄稼，放过牲畜，下过湖的人都由面黄饥瘦、体弱力衰，到最后挺着大肚子死去。有二十二户人家，死得干干净净。人们都说湖内有“鬼”，不敢再在湖内生产，也不愿再在湖边居住，纷纷迁移他乡。这就是“鬼湖”名称的由来。前年和去年，黄梅县开展了防治血吸虫病运动，三次翻耕湖地，消灭了钉螺，试种了棉花八百四十亩，因为土地肥沃，没有用一点肥料，其中二百二十亩，每亩年产皮棉高达二百四十斤。多年来危害人民生命的“鬼湖”，如今变成了丰产畈。
    这个故事说明消灭血吸虫病的必要性和重要性。
    神仙治不好的病共产党能治好
    我国十二个流行血吸虫病的省、市，都有类似公洲湖这样的事情。血吸虫病这个凶恶的敌人，不知害死了多少人！过去，人们也想过办法，但未能制止这个病的发展，更谈不到消灭它。只有在中国共产党的领导下，放手发动了群众，才有了消灭这个凶恶敌人的可能性。到去年年底，全国已有十五个县、市，基本上消灭了血吸虫病，群众说：“神仙治不好的病，共产党能治好”。这些地方在血吸虫病消灭以后，带来了三大好处：一恢复了人民健康，二增加了生产，三改善了人民生活，真是福国利民的大好事！
    我们在防治血吸虫病的斗争中，一向坚持党中央的积极防治的方针，采取综合的措施，坚决贯彻群众运动与科学技术相结合的原则。有些人总有这样的迷信：我国在国民党统治时期搞了二十多年，没有搞出一个名堂来；日本搞了几十年，也没有把它消灭掉；别的国家的科学家研究来研究去，也研究不出一个好办法，难道共产党能消灭血吸虫病吗？归根结底，他们不相信群众，也不相信自己。可是去冬和今春农村中出现的防治血吸虫病的新洪峰，给他们上了生动的一课。在党的领导下，广大农民学习了农业发展纲要，经过大鸣大放、大争大辩的整风运动，人们的思想解放了，共产主义精神大大发扬，忘我劳动，干劲冲天，于是乎展开了一场空前未有的几千万人参加的防治血吸虫病运动。这个运动真是轰轰烈烈，惊天动地，见所未见，闻所未闻。江苏省昆山县共十五万个劳动力，就有十二万人投入运动，白天红旗漫野，夜晚灯火齐明，气壮山河的口号响遍田野：“早迎太阳夜披星，黄昏干到大天明，我们的力量比山大，我们的热情比火红，那怕河水像海洋，三天三夜抽干净，抽净河水灭钉螺，坚决消灭大肚病”。英雄的人民是任何困难都压不倒的。即使大风大雨群众还是穿上蓑衣，戴上斗笠，踏着泥泞的圩岸，一面干一面唱着：“风雨不误上战场，白天黑夜都一样，小小钉螺是敌人，铧铲铁?当刀枪”，南方许多地区水网交错，谁敢想像能把大小河流一下抽干进行灭螺呢？但是有些地方，竟然整县、整乡的做到了。安徽省芜湖县过去两年灭螺面积五万平方公尺，今春他们鼓起干劲，十八天就灭螺二百六十多万平方公尺，实现了基本无螺县。按照他们过去两年灭螺的速度推算，十八天的工作量要顶上一百零四年。今春全国土埋钉螺的面积，已经达到十二亿平方公尺，折算起来，相当于把福建全省铲掉四寸深的土皮。全国有三十二个县、市和四百个乡、镇达到了基本无螺。从上海看来，有的科学技术人员对于消灭钉螺曾经抱着怀疑的态度或唱着悲观的调子，半吞半吐地说：“消灭钉螺，那是遥远未来的事情，要等到胡子白了才能实现”。
    当着北风凛冽、大雪飞飘的时候，上海西郊区广大群众和驻沪陆海空军，一齐动手，戽起河水，他们望着河水摇摇头，认为无法抽干；曾几何时，看到河底露出，挖泥积肥，又消灭了钉螺，他们就点点头了。
    生产插上翅膀，促进血防运动；血防得到胜利，生产乘了飞机
    治疗工作，由于普遍采取了三人小组，巡回驻社和推广三天治疗的新方法，今春已治疗了三十五万病人，差不多赶上了前年一年，超过了去年半年的治疗人数。这种群众性的防治运动的生动事例，也就横扫了一切保守思想。以前有些医学专家死啃着二十天的长程疗法，硬说“推广三天短程疗法会多死人”。经过去冬全国血吸虫病研究委员会常委扩大会议、第四次全国防治血吸虫病会议，采取鸣放、争辩的方式，展开了批评和自我批评，扫除了某些专家的宗派情绪、保守思想、个人权威思想和教条主义的思想障碍，于是三天疗法在今春得以普遍推行，时间短，治病多，花钱少，死亡率低，群众鼓掌欢迎，使他们不得不打破陈规旧章。
    在这个伟大战斗中，人们的生活习惯也改变了，像云南少数民族地区，就改变了自古以来拉野屎的老习惯，把粪便管理起来，不让血吸虫虫卵散播。仅大理白族自治州一地，一个月的时间就修建了六万个厕所，做到“家家有厕，户户有圈”。群众的干劲加钻劲，就把许多过去认为办不到的事情，一下办到了，真正做到了又多又快又好又省。
    防治血吸虫病必须紧密结合生产，这条经验，被今春轰轰烈烈的防治运动再一次证明了，进一步丰富了。群众说：“生产插上翅膀，促进血防运动，血防得到胜利，生产乘了飞机。”这就是生产和血防互相促进的关系。不少地区群众在灭螺方面提出“一炮三响”的口号。一炮是：戽干河水；三响：一是挖泥积肥，二是改善灌溉，三是消灭钉螺。在管理粪便方面提出“一炮五响”的口号。一炮是：管好粪便；五响：一是多积肥料、提高肥效，二是消灭血吸虫虫卵，三是消灭苍蝇，四是减少肠胃传染病，五是改善农村卫生面貌。这既有利生产，又能结合爱国卫生运动，得到了群众热烈响应，他们高唱：“要想高产千斤粮，必须肥多劳力强，日夜苦战灭钉螺，治水积肥身体壮”。湖南、湖北、福建、广东四省的统计：在这次防治运动中，共积肥二亿四千八百五十五万余担，兴修水利五亿八千六百二十多万立方公尺，还结合围垦灭螺，增加耕地面积七十万八千八百九十七亩。这些事实活生生地说明：一定要密切结合生产，兴修水利，充分发动群众，才能有效地做好防治工作。
    领导带头做样子群众一齐动手干
    今春大规模群众性防治运动获得的巨大成绩，也说明了政治挂帅，领导同志亲自动手，整顿防治队伍的必要性。安徽省宣城县县委五位书记一齐出动，分头参战。过去是“群众干，领导看”，今年是“领导带头做样子，群众一齐动手干”。广大干部不但是领导群众运动的指挥员，而且是战斗员，检验员，技术员。群众说：“干部白天是关公横刀跃马，夜晚是孔明献计筹谋。”又说：“只要你们干部能想到，我们就能做到，你们扶起梯子，我们就敢上天。”过去很多防治干部脱离群众、脱离实际，像江西省进贤县有些防治干部三不出去：刮风下雨不出去；早晨晚上不出去；天冷天热不出去。群众说：这是哪里来的一些“公子哥儿”。整风运动反掉了他们的歪风邪气，思想面貌，工作作风，为之一变。他们一面参加生产，一面抓起了防治工作，生气勃勃地干起来了，改善了干群关系，得到了群众的欢迎和支持。由此观之，只要我们干部以群众之苦为苦，以群众之乐为乐，干群溶成一片，就能产生无限力量，任何事情没有办不到的。
    今春防治血吸虫病战线上的胜利，确实是鼓舞人心的一件大事。如果没有共产党的领导，没有整风运动的胜利，没有农业发展纲要的鼓舞，没有合作化组织的优越性，没有积极防治的方针和采取综合的措施，要出现这样的壮举是不可想像的。但我们绝不能因此就自满松懈。目前，有些地区已经产生了“差不多”的思想，特别是那些基本消灭钉螺、消灭血吸虫病的地区。其实，“基本”不等于彻底，还必须再接再厉，反复扫荡，趁热打铁，一气呵成，以达到彻底消灭的目的。今年我们的战斗目标是要在一百三十四个流行县、市内基本消灭血吸虫病，其中部分地区要做到彻底消灭，而且要结合防治疟疾、血丝虫病、钩虫病等。就已有的成绩与这个要求相比较，距离还远。现在血吸虫病流行地区的防治工作可分为三类：一类是快马加鞭；一类是随马信步；一类是下马慢行。现在运动的发展是不平衡的，只有落后的赶上先进，先进的更加先进，掀起比先进、学先进、赶先进的高潮，才能使运动不断地向前推进。有人说：搞防治运动要等农闲。这是旧观点，看老皇历办事。在今天生产大跃进的形势下，那里还有忙闲季节之分呢！我们建议血吸虫病流行地区各级党委把防治工作纳入合作社的生产规划中去，提倡“月月有安排，经常有工作，一年十二月，月月不落空”。一年准备、四年战斗，两年扫尾，在一切可能的地方消灭血吸虫病，这是第一次全国防治血吸虫病会议提出的战斗口号。今年是四年战斗的第二年，也是今后大战三年的第一年，三年看头年，今年是最紧要关头而有决定性的一年。我们一定要奋勇前进，把这个凶恶的敌人消灭掉。诚然，这是我们前人未曾办到的事。但是两年实践的经验告诉我们，特别是在今春全面大跃进的巨浪推动下，更显现出群众伟大的力量，又有什么困难不能克服呢？处在这样有利的时机，有这样英雄的人民，为什么不快马加鞭地向前飞跃呢？让我们趁着东风鼓起船帆，乘风破浪前进吧！
