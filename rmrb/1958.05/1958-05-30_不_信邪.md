From the distant southwest of the motherland comes good news: In the past two months or so, more than 90% of the tools in ?麓 County's local industries have been reformed, and half of the tools have been mechanized with local methods. Hand-cranked lathes, foot-operated drilling machines, hydraulic blowers... are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Production efficiency has increased tenfold, even a hundredfold rapidly. Here, the flowers of the technical revolution are blooming all over the garden, and the fruits are abundant.

Is the tide of technological innovation in ?麓 County so high because of a good industrial foundation? No. Until now, the only equipment in the county that can be called modern is four small machine tools, besides the generator. The county not only has no engineers or technicians, but even no formal technical workers.

Did they probably get a lot of foreign aid? Not really. In the past two years, they have purchased only eight machines and more important tools from other places. As for technical support, the province only sent smelting personnel and a technical innovation promotion team to help with the work for a few days this year.

The great development of the technical innovation movement in this county relies on only one magic weapon: breaking superstition and daring to think and act.

"Only machines can make machines, how can lathes be made by hand?" "There is not a single technician, how can we carry out technical innovation?" At the beginning, some people in this county still had such superstitious ideas and lacked confidence in technological innovation. The county party committee promptly pointed out that "roads are made by people" and "three cobblers can outwit Zhuge Liang". As long as we believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and bring out the wisdom of the workers, we can "eliminate backward tools". In practical work, the county party committee took various measures to encourage liberating thought and bold creation. All cadres and workers in the county did not "believe in evil", and "evil" could not stop their progress. To gradually transition from handicraft production to modern mass production is a great and arduous task. To successfully complete this task, we must first break superstition, liberate our minds, dare to create, and dare to innovate. The technological innovation movement in ?麓 County's local industries only formed a vigorous momentum after breaking superstitious ideas. The facts of this county will also help those who are still superstitious about foreign countries, bourgeois technical experts, and still "believe in evil" to break superstition.

    不“信邪”
    从祖国遥远的大西南传来喜讯：最近两个多月，?麓县地方工业90％以上的工具都经过了改革，半数的工具实现了土机械化。手摇车床、脚踏钻床、水力鼓风机……如春笋竞长。生产效率十倍、百倍迅速提高。在这里，技术革命的花朵已经满园盛开，果实累累了。
    ?麓县革新技术的浪潮如此高涨，是因为工业基础很好吗？否。直到目前，全县称得上现代化的设备，除发电机外，只有四部小型机床。这个县不但没有工程师、技术员，就是正式的技术工人也没有。
    他们大概得到了大量外援吧？也不是。这两年他们从外地购买的机器和较重要的工具，不过八件。至于技术力量，今年省里只派冶炼人员和技术革新推广团来帮助工作了几天。
    这个县技术革新运动的大发展，只是靠了一个法宝：打破迷信，敢想敢干。
    “只有机器造机器，哪有手工造车床？”“一个技术人员也没有，怎样搞技术革新？”开始的时候，这个县里有人还存在这样那样的迷信心理，对革新技术缺乏信心。县委及时指出：“路是人走出来的”，“三个臭皮匠凑成诸葛亮”，只要相信群众，依靠群众，把工人群众的智慧发挥出来，就可以“消灭落后工具”。在实际工作中，县委采取了各种办法鼓励解放思想，大胆创造。全县干部、职工人人不“信邪”，“邪”就绊不住他们前进的脚步了。要从手工业生产逐步转到现代化的大生产是个伟大而艰巨的任务。要顺利地完成这一任务，首先就要打破迷信，解放思想，大胆创造，大胆革新。?麓县地方工业的技术革新运动就是在打破迷信思想以后才形成了轰轰烈烈的气势。这个县的事实也将有助于目前还迷信外国、迷信资产阶级技术专家、还“信邪”的人打破迷信。
