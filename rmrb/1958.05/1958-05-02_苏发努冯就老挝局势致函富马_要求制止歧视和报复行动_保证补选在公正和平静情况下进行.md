Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st: According to the Vietnam News Agency on May 1st: Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, wrote a letter to Prince Phouma, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, on April 9th. In the letter, Prince Souphanouvong listed numerous facts of persecution suffered by personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and other Lao patriots since the incorporation of the former Lao Fighting Units into the Lao National Army in mid-January 1958, especially since the start of the campaign for the supplementary election of members of the Lao National Assembly in March this year, as well as obstructions to the Lao Patriotic Party's campaign activities. He demanded that Prince Phouma take effective measures to immediately stop the actions of discrimination and retaliation against personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units, the Lao Patriotic Party, and other Lao patriots, so that the supplementary election of National Assembly members can be conducted in full compliance with the laws of the Kingdom and the agreements reached between the government of the Kingdom of Laos and the former Lao Fighting Units, with fairness and peace fully guaranteed.

The verified facts listed by Prince Souphanouvong in the letter include:

    One, with the tacit approval of the Lao administrative authorities, police, and army, anonymous pamphlets and leaflets were printed and distributed, slandering personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and the Patriotic Party. After listing some of these pamphlets and leaflets, the letter pointed out that a leaflet signed "Voice of All Lao People" even demanded that the government of the Kingdom of Laos allow and condone any current suppression activities against personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and the Lao Patriotic Party.

    Two, fabricating charges to accuse and arrest personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and members of the Lao Patriotic Party, and subjecting them to threats, violence, and torture, forcing them to confess to crimes they neither committed nor planned, such as plotting to overthrow the Kingdom government, establishing underground armories, and forming underground armed groups. The letter listed arrest incidents in Sam Neua Province, Pakse Province, and Phongsaly Province, the open or secret killing of personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units and members of the Lao Patriotic Party in Luang Prabang and Attapeu Provinces, and the grenade and drug attacks on Lao Patriotic Party candidates and personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units in Savannakhet and Vientiane.

The letter also pointed out that certain ministers and provincial governors of the Lao Kingdom government had summoned civil servants, district chiefs, and village chiefs, ordering them to ensure the election of certain candidates, and threatening them with dismissal if they allowed candidates of the Lao Patriotic Party or its sympathizers to be elected. Certain companies of the Lao Kingdom army were ordered to villages to tear down and destroy photos and propaganda materials of Lao Patriotic Party candidates. Certain soldiers and plainclothes police were also ordered to monitor candidates, propagandists, and sympathizers of the Lao Patriotic Party, and to prohibit them from reading and studying election laws and laws guaranteeing democratic freedoms. In addition, the Lao administrative authorities only issued ballots to voters who agreed to elect certain candidates, while refusing to issue ballots to voters who elected candidates and sympathizers of the Lao Patriotic Party.

The letter pointed out that the above-mentioned facts occurred due to the re-ignition of old grudges and personal revenge, in order to restore discord and division. Brotherly struggles and killings only benefit certain foreigners. At the same time, these facts occurred due to the elimination or suppression of personnel of the former Lao Fighting Units, the Lao Patriotic Party, and its sympathizers, to benefit discriminatory and anti-democratic measures systematically taken by certain figures in the Lao Kingdom government and certain administrative and military authorities.

Prince Souphanouvong pointed out in the letter that the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, including the main leaders of the former Lao Fighting Units, is in fact the agent of the interests of the former Lao Fighting Units and its sympathizers as stipulated in the agreement reached between the Lao Kingdom government and the Lao Fighting Units. The letter pointed out that only by strictly and fully implementing the above-mentioned agreement can the Lao Kingdom government guarantee that all Lao citizens exercise the democratic freedoms stipulated by the laws and constitution of the Lao Kingdom, and consolidate the spirit of national harmony and unity in accordance with the wishes of all Lao people.

Prince Souphanouvong handed the same letter to Phoungsavanh, Speaker of the Lao National Assembly, and Ansari, Chairman of the Lao International Commission.

    苏发努冯就老挝局势致函富马
    要求制止歧视和报复行动
    保证补选在公正和平静情况下进行
    新华社河内1日电　据越南通讯社1日讯：老挝爱国党中央执行委员会主席苏发努冯亲王曾经在4月9日写信给老挝王国首相富马亲王。苏发努冯亲王在信中列举了1958年1月中旬前寮国战斗部队并入老挝国家军队以来，特别是今年3月老挝国民议会议员补充选举的竞选活动开始以来前寮国战斗部队人员和其他老挝爱国人士遭受迫害以及阻挠老挝爱国党进行竞选活动的大量事实，并且要求富马亲王采取有效措施，立即停止歧视和报复前寮国战斗部队人员、老挝爱国党和其他老挝爱国人士的行动，使国民议会议员的补充选举能够完全符合王国法律和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间达成的协议，在公正和平静完全得到保障的情况下进行。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中列举的经过核对的事实包括：
    一、在老挝行政当局、警察和军队的默许下，有人印刷和散布匿名的小册子和传单，诬蔑前寮国战
  斗部队人员和爱国党。信中在列举了一些这类小册子和传单以后指出，一份署名“全老挝人民之声”的传单甚至要求老挝王国政府容许和庇护目前的任何镇压活动，以反对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党。
    二、捏造罪名控告和逮捕前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党党员，并且对他们施加威胁、暴力和毒刑，迫使他们承认他们既没有干过，也没有筹划过的罪行，例如阴谋推翻王国政府、建立地下军火库，组成地下武装集团等。信中列举了在桑怒省、百细省和丰沙里省的逮捕事件，在琅勃剌邦和阿速坡省公开或秘密杀害前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党党员，以及在沙湾拿吉和万象用手榴弹和毒品袭击老挝爱国党候选人和前寮国战斗部队人员的事件。
    信中还指出，老挝王国政府的某些部长和省长曾经召集公务人员、区长、村长，命令他们让某些候选人当选，并且威胁他们说，如果他们让老挝爱国党的候选人或它的同情者当选就把他们解职。老挝王国军队的某些连队曾经受命到村庄中撕毁和破坏老挝爱国党候选人的照片和宣传品。某些士兵和便衣警察还受命监视老挝爱国党的候选人、宣传员和同情者，禁止他们阅读和研究选举法和保障民主自由法。此外，老挝行政当局只发选票给那些同意选举某些候选人的选民，而拒绝发给那些选举老挝爱国党的候选人和同情者的选民。
    信中指出，发生上述事实都是在于重新挑起旧恨和个人报复，以恢复不和和分裂。而兄弟间的角斗和残杀只对某些外国人有利。同时，发生这些事实是在于消灭或镇压前寮国战斗部队人员、老挝爱国党和它的同情者，以利于老挝王国政府中某些人物和某些行政和军事当局有步骤采取的歧视和反民主措施。
    苏发努冯亲王在信中指出，老挝爱国党的中央执行委员会包括了前寮国战斗部队的主要领袖，事实上它是老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间达成的协议所规定的前寮国战斗部队和它的同情者的利益的代理者。信中指出，老挝王国政府只有严格和完全地执行上述协议，才能保障老挝全体公民行使老挝王国法律和宪法规定的民主自由，按照全体老挝人民的愿望巩固民族和谐和团结的精神。
    苏发努冯亲王把同样的信件交给了老挝国民议会议长方丰萨万和老挝国际委员会主席安萨里。
