Nanning, May 29th (By our reporter Huang Yijie) - Under the illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the development of local industry in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is progressing with unstoppable force, advancing a thousand miles a day. As of May 26th, over 36,000 factories and mines across the region have been put into operation. The vast majority of these factories and mines have been developed in just over the past month, with an average of about 800 new factories and mines emerging daily.

In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, where the industrial base was extremely weak, local industry has rapidly taken on a vigorous momentum in a short period. A key factor is the implementation of the general line for socialist construction and the policy of the entire Party and all the people running industry. Previously, cadres and the masses in the Autonomous Region held serious “mystification,” “formalization,” and “pessimistic” views about Guangxi's backwardness regarding the development of local industry. Consequently, local industry in various areas remained limited to a small number of factories and mines run by counties and above.

Through Debate and Criticism of Various Fallacies
New Factories and Mines Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots After Rain

In mid-April, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a meeting of prefectural party secretaries in Liuzhou, conveying the general line proposed by the Central Committee of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The meeting also focused on studying how to vigorously develop local industry. After the meeting, various areas widely communicated this general line to cadres and the masses, implemented the policy of the entire Party and all the people running industry, and universally launched a large-scale debate, forcefully criticizing "pessimistic" views such as "Guangxi is backward" and "rural areas cannot develop industry" and "mystification". After the great debate, the broad masses of cadres and people broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, and displayed a communist spirit of daring to think, daring to do, and acting immediately. The development of local industry throughout the region then progressed with unstoppable force. Under the slogan of "Dare to speak, dare to think, work practically, run industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, combine foreign and indigenous methods, large and small scales, and build and produce simultaneously," the Yishan Special District had over 10,900 factories and mines put into operation by May 26th. In vast minority areas with no history of industry, new factories and mines also sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain. The Da Miao Shan Miao Autonomous County built 1,375 factories and mines in thirteen days. In Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County, Doujiang District achieved industry in every township and cooperative within just four days. By mid-May, this district had 297 small factories and mines in operation, averaging thirteen factories and mines per cooperative.

Local Industry Serves Agriculture
Receiving Warm Support from Peasants

Firmly implementing the policy of local industry serving agriculture is another reason for the rapid development of local industry. Various areas developed local industry around the needs of agricultural production, thereby resolving contradictions in the agricultural leap forward and receiving warm support from the broad masses of peasants. For example, Shilon County experienced drought and fertilizer shortages this spring, and the masses demanded a supply of drought-resistant tools and fertilizers. The County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party first focused on building factories to manufacture agricultural tools and fertilizers. Consequently, the broad masses of peasants enthusiastically set up agricultural tool factories and granular fertilizer factories as if they were preparing for a happy event, quickly realizing that every cooperative had an agricultural tool factory and every team had a granular fertilizer factory. After being put into production, in just over a month, they manufactured more than 240,000 new-style agricultural tools and water-lifting tools, and more than 12 million catties of granular fertilizer, which played a significant role in combating drought and promoting seedling growth. The practical benefits of local industry serving agriculture further stimulated the enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants for running industry. This county quickly formed a high tide of vigorously developing industry, with more than 3,000 newly built factories and mines in two months, averaging fourteen per cooperative. This exceeded the original planning targets of five factories and one mine (an agricultural tool factory, a granular fertilizer factory, a lime factory, a rice milling factory, an agricultural product processing factory, and a mine) per cooperative. Of the more than 36,000 factories and mines put into operation throughout the Autonomous Region, those serving agriculture account for 70%-90%. Many townships and cooperatives have already established fertilizer networks and agricultural tool manufacturing and repair networks.

Relying on the Masses, Making Do with Whatever Is Available
All Difficulties Resolved Readily

In addition, during the process of vigorously developing industry, various areas in the Autonomous Region have trusted and relied on the masses, adopted the method of making do with whatever is available, prioritizing indigenous methods over foreign ones, and starting from small scales and growing larger, overcoming various difficulties, and establishing industries. For example, the construction materials, funds, factory buildings, equipment, and so on for the factories were all resolved by relying on the masses to find solutions. Lacking technical personnel, various areas concentrated local carpenters, blacksmiths, and technical personnel scattered in rural areas, and adopted methods such as sending people to visit and study in other places, studying abroad, and apprenticeships with master craftsmen and old factories helping new factories to solve the problem.

To strengthen the leadership of industrial construction, after mid-April, the Party committees at the autonomous region, prefectural, county, township, and agricultural cooperative levels all assigned the first secretary and secretaries of the Party committee to personally manage industry; the entire region transferred more than 5,000 cadres to the industrial front to supplement and strengthen the leadership of industrial construction. Further measures are being taken to exchange experiences and organize cooperation to overcome various difficulties in production and construction, so as to consolidate the development of local industry.

    听！社会主义步伐的音响
    广西每天出现八百个厂矿
    一个多月已有三万多个厂矿投入生产
    本报南宁29日电　记者黄义杰报道：在社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，广西僮族自治区地方工业的发展势如破竹，一日千里。到5月26日止，全区已经投入生产的厂矿有三万六千多个，其中绝大多数的厂矿是在最近一个多月内发展起来的，平均每天约有八百个新厂矿出现。
    在工业基础极为薄弱的广西僮族自治区，短期内地方工业便出现了万马齐奔的形势。其中一条主要的经验是贯彻执行了社会主义建设总路线，实行全党全民办工业的方针。在此以前，自治区的干部和群众中对发展地方工业存在着严重的“神秘化”、“正规化”和广西落后的“悲观论”思想，因而，各地的地方工业只停留在县以上所办的少数厂矿。
  通过辩论批判各种谬论
    新建厂矿有如雨后春笋
    4月中旬，中共广西僮族自治区委员会在柳州召开了地委书记会议，传达了中央提出的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，并着重研究了如何大搞地方工业问题。会后各地在干部和群众中广泛传达了这条总路线，贯彻执行全党全民办工业，普遍地开展大辩论，有力地批判了“广西落后”、“农村搞不起工业”等“悲观论”和“神秘论”。经过大辩论后，广大干部和群众破除了迷信，解放了思想，出现了敢想敢做，说干就干的共产主义风格。全区地方工业的发展，便势如破竹。宜山专区在“敢说敢想踏实干，多快好省全民办，洋土大小相结合，边筹边建边生产”的口号下，到5月26日止，就有一万零九百多个厂矿投入生产。历史上没有工业的广大少数民族地区，新的厂矿也像雨后春笋般出现。大苗山苗族自治县十三天就建成了一千三百七十五个厂矿。三江侗族自治县斗江区仅四天时间就实现了乡乡社社有工业，到5月中旬止，这个区已投入生产的小型厂矿有二百九十七个，平均每社十三个厂矿。
    地方工业为农业服务
    受到农民的热烈拥护
    坚决贯彻地方工业为农业服务的方针，是地方工业得以迅速发展的另一个原因。各地围绕着农业生产的需要发展地方工业，因而解决了农业大跃进中的矛盾，受到广大农民的热烈拥护。如石龙县今年春旱、缺肥，群众要求供应抗旱工具和肥料，中共县委便首先抓紧兴建制造农具和肥料的工厂，于是广大农民就像筹办喜事一样的大办农具厂和颗粒肥料厂，很快地实现了社社有农具厂、队队有颗粒肥料厂。投入生产后，短短的一个多月内，就制造出新式农具和提水工具二十四万多件，颗粒肥料一千二百多万斤，对于抗旱、催苗都起了很大作用。地方工业为农业服务的现实利益进一步刺激了广大农民办工业的积极性，这个县便很快形成了大办工业的高潮，两个月的时间新建成三千多个厂矿，平均每个社达十四个。超过了每个社原订五厂一矿（农具厂、颗粒肥料厂、石灰厂、碾米厂、农产品加工厂和一个矿）的规划指标。全自治区投入生产的三万六千多个厂矿，其中为农业服务的厂矿达70％—90％。很多乡、社已经建立了肥料网和农具制造修配网。
    依靠群众　因陋就简
    一切困难　迎刃而解
    此外，在大办工业过程中，自治区各地都相信群众、依靠群众，采取因陋就简，先土后洋，由小到大的办法，克服了各种困难，办起了工业。例如工厂的建筑材料、资金、厂房、设备等等，都是依靠群众想办法解决的。没有技术人员，各地就把当地的木匠、铁匠和分散在农村的技术人员集中起来，采取派人到外地参观、留学和师傅带徒弟、老厂包新厂的办法来解决。
    为了加强工业建设的领导，4月中旬以后，从区党委、地委、县委、乡党委和农业社，都做到了由党委第一书记和书记亲自管工业；全区并抽调五千多名干部转入工业战线，以充实和加强工业建设的领导力量。并且正在进一步采取交流经验，组织协作等措施，克服生产和建设中的各种困难，使地方工业巩固的发展。
