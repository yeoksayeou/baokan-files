Reported by our reporters Gao Fang and Hu Jizheng: Liaoning Province, in order to change the situation where agricultural backwardness, caused by the rapid development of industry, has resulted in the inability to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, pork, and vegetable production in past years, the entire party and all the people have been mobilized to work hard for sixty days, launching the first shot in the agricultural Great Leap Forward to achieve "three self-sufficiencies" in one year. Currently, after the province's farmers victoriously completed spring planting, they are, under the slogan "Crops grow daily, measures increase manifold," comprehensively carrying out field seedling inspection and replanting in conjunction with paddy rice transplanting, preparing to continue to set off a summer weeding production high tide centered on full and robust seedlings, combined with the ongoing year-round farmland water conservancy construction work.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, at the Prefectural Committee Secretary Meeting held from May 6th to 11th, reviewed and summarized the great achievements made in the spring production Great Leap Forward. According to the inspections and reports of the various prefectural committees, from last winter to early May, the irrigated area of ​​farmland has developed to 1.69 million hectares, accounting for 35% of the province's total cultivated land area, a threefold increase compared to 1957. Together with the achievements made in waterlogging control through swamp transformation, 43% of the province's cultivated land, totaling 2.1 million hectares, can now be guaranteed against drought and flood. In addition, the soil and water conservation projects newly built by the people in mountainous areas can control soil erosion over an area of ​​840,000 hectares, equivalent to the total of soil and water conservation projects built before 1957. The achievement of increasing the application of manure this year is also unprecedented. For the first time in the province's history, 100% of the cultivated land has been applied with base fertilizer.

Spring plowing and sowing were done early, quickly, and with good quality. The sowing time was generally half a month to twenty days earlier than in previous years, which can basically avoid the disaster of reduced yields caused by early autumn frost in previous years. During spring planting, the sown area of ​​high-yield crops such as rice, corn, and potatoes increased by more than 1.48 million hectares compared to last year, reaching a total of more than 2.6 million hectares, accounting for 60% of the province's grain crop sown area. More than 1.2 million hectares of land adopted advanced yield-increasing experiences such as mixed planting, intercropping, and relay intercropping, exceeding five times the area promoted last year. Great Leap Forwards have also emerged in the agricultural technology reform work of improving soil and promoting improved varieties. Currently, on the fertile fields along the Liao River, the early-sown farmland is a new green, with seedlings being fuller and more robust than in any previous year.

In order to timely clear ideological obstacles on the road forward, continue to improve the enthusiasm and confidence of cadres and the masses in the leap forward, the meeting, aimed at the current ideological sprouts of "anti-rashness" such as "production targets are too high, divorced from reality" among some cadres, as well as various skeptical arguments and negative emotions about achieving "three self-sufficiencies" in one year, adopted the method of checking measures and calculating detailed accounts, and carried out a powerful criticism.

First, check from the completion of yield-increasing measures: Calculating only from the completion of six yield-increasing measures, such as expanding the irrigated area, controlling waterlogging through swamp transformation, increasing the application of manure, planting more high-yield crops, improving soil, and expanding the cultivated area, the province's total grain output this year can reach more than 10 million tons. Second, check from the completion of the crop sowing plan: If rice is calculated at only 3.5 tons of rice per hectare (3.44 tons last year), and corn is calculated at only 2.7 tons of grain per hectare (2.44 tons last year), the comprehensive output of various grain crop sown areas can also reach more than 10 million tons. However, the province's grain output only needs to reach 8.5 million tons to be self-sufficient. At present, the province's pig production has increased by 240,000 heads compared to the end of last year, completing more than 66% of the self-sufficiency needs; vegetables have also been planted according to plan. These facts prove that it is very certain that we can achieve "three self-sufficiencies" in one year, and skepticism is unfounded.

The meeting also emphasized that in the face of the favorable situation in which great achievements have been made in spring production, we must also prevent any complacency and relaxation. The autumn harvest is still far away, and we must go through arduous struggles to complete the production leap forward target. The meeting decided to continue to mobilize the people of the province to exert great effort, tap potential, increase measures, and resolutely ensure the realization of "three self-sufficiencies" in one year. In May and June, we will launch a summer weeding production high tide centered on ensuring full and robust seedlings, and combine it with the farmland water conservancy construction movement to carry the year-round agricultural basic construction movement to the end. Therefore, the meeting requires that Party committees at all levels, according to the new situation of tense summer production this year, must vigorously improve and adjust labor organization, mobilize the masses to carry out a technical innovation movement, strive to improve labor efficiency, strengthen field management, and carry out hoeing, irrigation, and topdressing in a timely manner according to the needs of crop growth. High-yield crops must be topdressed at least twice, and insect pests must be captured and eliminated in time to ensure the vigorous growth of seedlings.

    庄稼日日长　措施倍倍增
    辽宁在春播工作胜利的基础上进入夏锄高潮
    本报讯　记者高方、胡技正报道：辽宁省为了改变随着工业的飞跃发展而农业落后造成的历年粮食、猪肉、蔬菜生产不能自给的状况，全党全民齐动员大干六十天，已打响了一年实现“三自给”的农业大跃进的第一炮。目前全省农民在胜利完成春播之后，又在“庄稼日日长，措施倍倍增”的口号下，正结合水田插秧全面开展大田查苗补苗工作，准备继续掀起一个以苗全苗旺为中心的夏锄生产高潮，结合进行常年农田水利建设工作。
    中共辽宁省委员会在5月6日到11日召开的地委书记会议上，检查总结了春季生产大跃进所取得的伟大成绩。根据各地委的检查和汇报，从去冬到5月初，农田的灌溉面积已发展到一百六十九万公顷，占全省总耕地面积的35％，比1957年扩大三倍，连同洼改治涝所取得的成绩，全省已有43％的耕地共二百一十万公顷农田可以旱涝保收。此外，山区人民新修的水土保持工程，可以控制水土流失的面积八十四万公顷，等于1957年以前兴修水土保持工程的总和。今年增施粪肥的成绩也是空前未有的。全省有史以来第一次百分之百的耕地都施了底粪。
    春耕播种做到了动手早、进度快、质量好，播种时间普遍比往年提前半月到二十天，这样就可基本上躲过历年秋季早霜减产的灾害。在春播中，水稻、玉米、薯类等高产作物的播种面积比去年增加了一百四十八万多公顷，共达二百六十多万公顷，占全省粮食作物播种面积的60％。有一百二十多万公顷土地采用了混种、间种、套种等先进增产经验，超过去年推广面积的五倍以上。在改良土壤和推广良种等农业技术改革工作中，也都出现了大跃进。目前辽河两岸的千里沃野上，早种的农田已一片新绿，苗齐苗旺赛过以往任何一年。
    为了及时扫清前进道路上的思想障碍，继续提高干部和群众的跃进热情和信心，会议针对目前在部分干部中认为“生产指标高了，脱离实际”等“反冒进”的思想萌芽，以及对一年实现“三自给”的各种怀疑论调和消极情绪，采取查措施、算细账的办法，进行了有力的批判。
    第一，从增产措施的完成情况检查：仅从扩大灌溉面积、洼改治涝、增施粪肥、多种高产作物、改良土壤、扩大耕地面积等六项增产措施的完成情况计算，今年全省的粮食总产量就可以达到一千多万吨。第二，从作物的播种计划完成情况检查，水稻仅按每公顷产稻谷三点五吨计算（去年为三点四四吨），玉米仅按每公顷产粮二点七吨计算（去年为二点四四吨），各种粮食作物播种面积的综合产量也可以达到一千万吨以上。但是全省的粮食产量只要达到八百五十万吨就可以自给了。目前，全省的生猪生产已比去年年底增加了二十四万头，完成了自给需要的66％以上；蔬菜也按计划落了底。这些事实证明：一年实现“三自给”是有十分把握的，怀疑论是没有根据的。
    会议同时强调指出：在春季生产已取得巨大成绩的有利形势面前，也必须防止任何自满松劲情绪，秋收尚远，要完成生产跃进指标还必须经过艰苦的斗争。会议决定要继续动员全省人民鼓足干劲，挖掘潜力，增加措施，坚决保证实现一年“三自给”。在5、6月份开展一个以保证苗全苗旺为中心的夏锄生产高潮，并结合开展农田水利建设运动，把常年农业基本建设运动坚持到底。因此会议要求各级党委根据今年夏季生产紧张的新情况，必须大力改进和调整劳动组织，发动群众开展技术革新运动，努力提高劳动效率，加强田间管理，根据作物生长需要适时进行铲趟、灌溉和追肥，高产作物至少要追两遍肥，发现害虫及时捕灭，以保证禾苗的旺盛生育。
