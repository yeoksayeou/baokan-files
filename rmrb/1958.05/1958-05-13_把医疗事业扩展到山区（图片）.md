Since liberation, the average age of the Czechoslovakian people has greatly increased. In 1930, the average age for men was 51.9 years, and for women, 55.2 years. By 1956, the average for men was 66 years, and for women, 71 years. This illustrates the Czechoslovakian government's concern for the health of its people. Now, Czechoslovakia's healthcare system has not only greatly developed in cities but has also expanded to remote areas and mountainous regions. The picture shows a hospital in the Muran mountainous region of Slovakia.

　　把医疗事业扩展到山区
    捷克斯洛伐克人民的平均年龄解放以来有很大增长。1930年时，男子平均年龄是五十一点九岁，妇女为五十五点二岁。到1956年男子平均为六十六岁，妇女是七十一岁。这说明了捷克斯洛伐克政府对人民的健康很关怀。现在，捷克斯洛伐克的保健事业不仅在城市有了很大的发展，而且已经扩展到边远地区和山区。图为斯洛伐克木拉尼山区的一个医院。
