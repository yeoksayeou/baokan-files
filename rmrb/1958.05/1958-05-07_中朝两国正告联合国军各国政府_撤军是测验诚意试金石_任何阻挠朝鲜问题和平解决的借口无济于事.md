Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Deputy Foreign Minister Luo Guibo received Mr. Wen Yuxing, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, this afternoon and presented him with a note from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, and requested the British government to forward it to the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side. This note is the reply of the Chinese government and the Chinese government on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the note from the British government on behalf of the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side on April 9. The full text of the note is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its respects to the British Chargé d'Affaires Office, and requests that the following matters be notified to the British government, and through the British government to the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side.

The British government, representing the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side, sent Note No. 35 to the Chinese government on April 9, 1958, as a reply to the two statements of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5, 1958, and the government of the People's Republic of China on February 7, 1958.

The Chinese government, in its own name and on behalf of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, makes the following reply to the British government's note.

The Korean government and the Chinese government have reviewed the situation over the past three months and are pleased to see that the initiative put forward by the Korean and Chinese governments to withdraw all foreign troops from Korea and peacefully resolve the Korean issue has won warm support and praise from many countries and peoples. In particular, the fact that the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided and are regularly and gradually withdrawing completely from Korea has opened up a new practical path for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. However, the Korean and Chinese governments cannot help but point out with regret that, just as peace-loving countries and peoples around the world are expecting the United States and other countries on the United Nations Forces side to withdraw all United Nations Forces from Korea, just as the Chinese People's Volunteers are doing, the United Nations Forces side has not taken any positive measures on the troop withdrawal issue. Not only that, but in their response to the Sino-Korean statements, which was delayed for two months, the United States and other governments on the United Nations Forces side deliberately avoided the most urgent and practical troop withdrawal issue in the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and mischievously brought up the so-called "clarification" of the issue of supervised elections to entangle the matter, although the Korean government has already expressed a clear attitude on this issue in its statement of February 5. The Korean and Chinese governments believe that this practice of the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side is clearly intended to divert the attention of the people of the world, in order to evade the inescapable responsibility of the United Nations Forces side to withdraw their troops from Korea, and to conceal the United States' long-term occupation of South Korea, continued obstruction of the peaceful reunification of Korea, and further creation of tension in the Far East.

The Korean and Chinese governments deem it necessary to once again remind the governments of the countries on the United Nations Forces side to face up to the favorable situation for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue brought about by the voluntary withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea, and the responsibilities they bear before the Korean people and the people of the world. Facts speak louder than words. If the United States and other governments on the United Nations Forces side do not want to prove that they have consistently obstructed the peaceful reunification of Korea and hindered the easing of tensions in the Far East, they should express their sincerity with actual troop withdrawal actions. Any attempt to find excuses to evade this issue will be of no avail. The Korean and Chinese governments are happy to know when the United States and other governments on the United Nations Forces side intend to withdraw all their troops from South Korea. Whether the United Nations Forces rapidly and completely withdraw from Korea is the touchstone for testing whether the governments of the countries participating in the United Nations Forces are sincere in peacefully resolving the Korean issue.

The Korean people are eager for the early realization of the peaceful reunification of their motherland, and the people of all countries in the world are also eager for the tensions in the Far East and the world to be eased. In order to realize these aspirations, the Korean and Chinese governments have made many efforts in the past and will continue to make unremitting efforts in the future. The Korean and Chinese governments have always believed that only the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea can provide the necessary conditions for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, including the issue of free elections. As long as the United States and other governments on the United Nations Forces side can, as suggested by the Korean and Chinese governments, clearly decide to withdraw all United Nations Forces from South Korea within a time limit and implement it, the Korean and Chinese governments are prepared to propose the convening of a conference of relevant countries to discuss the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue after the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea.

To the British Chargé d'Affaires Office,
Beijing, May 6, 1958

### 中朝两国正告联合国军各国政府  撤军是测验诚意试金石  任何阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的借口无济于事

    中朝两国正告联合国军各国政府
    撤军是测验诚意试金石
    任何阻挠朝鲜问题和平解决的借口无济于事
    新华社6日讯　外交部副部长罗贵波今天下午接见英国驻华代办文郁生，面交中华人民共和国外交部致英国驻华代办处的照会一份，并且要求英国政府转达联合国军方面各国政府。这份照会是中国政府和中国政府受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，对英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府4月9日来照的答复。照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部向英国驻华代办处致意，并请将下列事项通知英国政府，并且通过英国政府转达联合国军方面各国政府。
    英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府，在1958年4月9日以第三十五号照会发致中国政府，作为对于朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府1958年2月5日和中华人民共和国政府1958年2月7日两项声明的答复。
    中国政府以自己的名义，并且受朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的委托，对于英国政府的照会，提出以下答复。
    朝鲜政府和中国政府回顾了过去三个月以来的情况，并且高兴地看到，朝中两国政府所提出的从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题的倡议，已经博得许多国家和人民的热烈支持和赞扬。特别是中国人民志愿军决定并且正在定期、分批地全部撤出朝鲜的事实，已经为和平解决朝鲜问题开辟了新的现实的途径。但是，朝中两国政府不能不遗憾地指出，正当全世界爱好和平的国家和人民期待着美国和联合国军方面其他各国也能像中国人民志愿军一样，从朝鲜撤出全部联合国军的时候，联合国军方面却至今没有在撤军问题上采取任何积极的措施。不仅如此，美国和联合国军方面其他各国政府在他们拖延了两月之久的对朝中声明的答复中，竟然对这个在和平解决朝鲜问题上最为迫切和现实的撤军问题避开不谈，而别有用心地扯出所谓“澄清”监督选举的问题来进行纠缠，虽然朝鲜政府在他的2月5日的声明中对这个问题已经表示了明确的态度。朝中两国政府认为，联合国军方面各国政府的这种作法，显然是为了转移世界人民的视线，以图逃避联合国军方面无可逃避的从朝鲜撤出他们军队的责任，并且掩饰美国长期占领南朝鲜、继续阻挠朝鲜的和平统一和进一步制造远东紧张局势的阴谋。
    朝中两国政府认为有必要再一次提醒联合国军方面各国政府，正视由于中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜所引起的对和平解决朝鲜问题的有利形势和他们在朝鲜人民和世界人民面前所负有的责任。事实胜于雄辩，美国和联合国军方面其他各国政府如果不想证明他们是一贯阻挠朝鲜的和平统一和阻碍远东紧张局势和缓的话，就应该用实际的撤军行动来表示他们的诚意，任何寻找借口来回避这个问题的做法，都是无济于事的。朝中两国政府乐于知道，美国和联合国军方面其他各国政府究竟打算在什么时候从南朝鲜撤出他们的全部军队。联合国军是否迅速全部撤出朝鲜是测验参加联合国军的各国政府对和平解决朝鲜问题是否具有诚意的试金石。
    朝鲜人民渴望着祖国的和平统一早日实现，世界各国人民也迫切希望远东和世界的紧张局势得到和缓，为了实现这些愿望，朝中两国政府过去曾经作过许多努力，今后也将继续进行不懈的努力。朝中两国政府始终认为，只有一切外国军队撤出朝鲜，才能为和平解决朝鲜问题包括自由选举问题提供必要条件。只要美国和联合国军方面其他各国政府能够像朝中两国政府所建议的那样，明确地决定限期从南朝鲜撤出全部联合国军，并且予以实施，朝中两国政府准备建议召开有关国家会议，就一切外国军队撤出朝鲜后和平解决朝鲜问题进行协商。
