Xinhua News Agency Report: Yunnan Province's more than 110,000 rural work cadres have adopted the method of combining work, labor, and study, setting off a surge in learning political theory, science and technology, leadership methods, and cultural knowledge. Many cadres have expressed their determination to train themselves into communist fighters who are both red and expert at the fastest possible speed.

In Qujing, Chuxiong, Wenshan and other places, cadres at all levels, in addition to studying according to the spirit of "learn what you do, learn as you go," have also universally studied Chairman Mao's report "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." More than 10,000 cadres in Yuxi Prefecture are determined to train themselves into cadres who understand the Party's line and policies and are proficient in their respective fields within three to five years.

Cadres in Zhanyi, Songming, Jiangchuan, Jinning, Yiliang, Rongfeng and other counties, more than 90%, have purchased agricultural knowledge series and other science and technology books. While studying agricultural science and technology books on soil, fertilizer, plant cultivation, and pest control, they actively plant experimental fields with technicians and experienced farmers. Ou Cai, the county magistrate of Zhanyi County, created a local crane after studying the principles of physics, which increased soil transportation efficiency by three times. Cadres in Songming County generally adopt a combination of three personnel (livestock technicians, technicians, and accountants) to plant experimental fields. Before each technical measure is carried out, the technicians explain scientific and technological knowledge and conduct on-the-spot experiments. This approach has yielded great results. Qujing County has also adopted the method of short-term training classes to transfer cadres to study technology.

Cadres in border ethnic minority areas, in addition to studying political theory, are also actively learning local ethnic languages and scripts.

　　结合工作　结合劳动　向又红又专迈进
    云南农村干部开始苦学
    新华社讯　云南省十一万多农村工作干部采取工作、劳动、学习三结合的办法，掀起了学习政治理论、科学技术、领导方法及文化知识的热潮。很多干部表示要用最快的速度把自己锻炼成为又红又专的共产主义战士。
    曲靖、楚雄、文山等地各级干部，除根据做什么学什么、边干边学的精神进行学习外，还普遍学习了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的报告。玉溪专区的一万多干部，决心在三、五年内锻炼成为既懂得党的路线、政策，又精通本行业务的干部。
    沾益、嵩明、江川、晋宁、宜良、榕峰等县的干部，90％以上都买了农业知识丛书及其它科学技术书籍，一面攻读土壤、肥料、植物栽培、病虫害防治等农业科学技术书，一面和技术员、老农一起，积极种试验田。沾益县县长欧材学习了物理学的原理后，创造出一种土起重机，使运土效率提高三倍。嵩明县干部一般都采取三员结合（畜牧员、技术员、会计员）种试验田，每进行一项技术措施时，事前都由技术员讲解科学技术知识，并当场试验。这种做法收获很大。曲靖县还采取短期训练班的办法，抽调干部学习技术。
    在边疆民族地区的干部，除学习政治理论等外，还积极学习当地的民族语言和文字。
