Comrade Shaoqi's report, based on the rich experience of our people's construction practice, demonstrates that it is entirely possible for us to achieve the most profound changes and build socialism in our country in the shortest period of history. This is a great encouragement to us. Can we develop grain production at a faster pace in accordance with the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical? Judging from the experience of Guangdong in recent years, especially since last winter and this spring, it is entirely possible. Although Guangdong only increased grain production by 5.5 billion jin during the first five-year plan, an increase of 29%, which was not fast, an analysis shows that there are reasons for this. Of these 5.5 billion jin, 3 billion jin were basically increased by relying on the enthusiasm of the small-scale peasant economy during and after the land reform in the first three years before cooperation; in the year of cooperation, although the work of establishing cooperatives and production were carried out simultaneously, and the harvest was not good, the production increased by 2 billion jin; last year, due to the influence of localism and opposition to "rash advance" in Guangdong, the enthusiasm for production greatly diminished, and although the harvest was not bad, the production only increased by 500 million jin. However, the situation of great leap forward since last winter and this spring has brought about an unprecedented situation in agricultural production. The spring harvest alone has doubled and increased by 2 billion jin this year, which we have already received. The spring harvest does not account for a large proportion of Guangdong's total annual grain output, and the main harvest is two crops of rice. After a series of technical measures such as early sowing, early transplanting, close planting, and strengthening field management, the rice seedlings are growing very well, and most of them can reach 200,000 ears per mu. The late rice crop has always been relatively stable, and with the experience of implementing technical reforms in the early crop, it is estimated that it will be even better. In addition, sweet potatoes have great potential, and as long as they are seriously grasped, they can at least leap forward by one time. In this way, as long as we work diligently and do not encounter particularly large natural disasters, it is entirely possible to achieve the second account of Guangdong's grain increase, that is, the target of increasing production by 6 billion jin for the whole year. If we do well, it will greatly exceed this. According to our recent calculations, Guangdong has a great possibility of becoming a grain province of 800 jin per mu next year or at the latest the year after. In this way, there is a reliable basis for achieving the 40 articles of the agricultural development program ahead of schedule.

The experience of achieving high grain yields has already been gained in Guangdong. As early as last year, 12 counties and cities in the province had an average output of 800 jin or even 1,000 jin or more, and in addition, there were a considerable number of townships and societies that had already reached this target. How these areas can achieve even higher yields in the future requires further creation of experience. However, for the vast majority of areas in the province, reaching a yield of 800 jin or 1,000 jin per mu is no longer a question of whether or not there is experience, but how to rapidly popularize the existing experience and resolutely implement it.

The fundamental conditions for accelerating grain production are:
	Passing the three barriers of water, soil, and fertilizer, and attacking the technical barrier

According to Guangdong's experience, what fundamental conditions are required to rapidly transform grain from low yield to high yield? First, it depends on whether we can rapidly pass the three barriers of water, soil, and fertilizer; second, with water, soil, and fertilizer, it also depends on whether we can rapidly adopt a set of good cultivation techniques and cultivation systems. Both are indispensable.

Water, soil, and fertilizer are the foundation of agricultural production. If these three barriers are not passed, there is no condition to talk about technical reform. The peasants are very clear about this. They say, "Water is the blood of seedlings, without it, it's terrible," "The long-mouthed want to eat, the long-rooted want fertilizer," and also say, "Good fields grow good rice, bad fields grow weeds." It can be seen that water, soil, and fertilizer are very important. However, only having the conditions of water, soil, and fertilizer, without good cultivation techniques and cultivation systems, still cannot obtain high yields. Countless facts in Guangdong prove that on the same basis of water, soil, and fertilizer, the yield varies greatly simply because of the difference between advanced and backward cultivation techniques. Therefore, when we change the natural conditions and create a good water, soil, and fertilizer foundation for crops, we must also closely follow up in terms of cultivation techniques and cultivation systems in order to fully exert the role of water, soil, and fertilizer and rapidly obtain high yields.

People are relatively easy to recognize the importance of water, soil, and fertilizer. As long as we resolutely mobilize the masses and go all out, these barriers of water, soil, and fertilizer can be broken through in a short period of time, as proven by the experience of various places. At present, about half of Guangdong's grain arable land has reached the standard of supplying 500 cubic meters of water per mu, completely eliminating drought; more than a quarter has the standard of supplying 300 to 400 cubic meters of water, eliminating ordinary drought; less than a quarter has a water supply of less than 300 cubic meters, and only 8% of them have no water conservancy facilities. Fertilizer accumulation has also made a great leap forward. This year, the average fertilizer per mu in spring plowing is 400 dan, and agricultural cooperatives throughout the province have promoted the method of manufacturing mixed fertilizer and quick-acting fertilizer. In addition, after using intercropping and multiple cropping to plant green manure crops in large quantities, the fertilizer supply has a more reliable foundation. After large-scale soil improvement throughout the province, low-yield fields have decreased from 15 million mu to 9 million mu, and some medium-yield fields have now become high-yield fields. In general, according to the requirements of 800 jin to 1,000 jin of grain per mu, some areas in the province have already passed the three barriers of water, soil, and fertilizer, most areas are passing them, they can be passed before autumn, and some areas can also be passed before spring plowing next year.

However, the masses do not have the same views on the reform of cultivation techniques and cultivation systems. There is an ideological struggle between advanced and backward, innovation and conservatism. Because the backward cultivation techniques and cultivation systems in the past were generated on the basis of the small-scale peasant economy and adapted to the backward water, soil, and fertilizer conditions, and people's thinking is always behind reality, therefore, although the conditions of water, soil, and fertilizer have greatly changed, traditional farming habits still have an extremely profound impact on farmers who have just been liberated from the individual economy. This has created a contradiction between the relatively good water, soil, and fertilizer conditions and the cultivation technology conditions that are not adapted to it. This contradiction puts a very urgent task before the Party: we must grasp technology. Since this spring, the attention of the entire Party in Guangdong has begun to shift to this aspect, and we are currently making every effort to attack the technical barrier. This period of work proves that as long as the secretaries take action, the entire Party mobilizes, and the masses are fully mobilized, the technical barrier can be quickly conquered by us, just like the water, soil, and fertilizer barriers.

In order to achieve 800 jin of grain per mu in the short term, what measures have we taken to reform cultivation techniques and cultivation systems? Reforming the cultivation system and increasing the multiple cropping and intercropping index is still a very important way. Guangdong can not only basically realize three crops a year this winter, but also use the summer leisure between the upper and lower crops to plant green manure and potatoes, highly utilize the land, and implement the most reasonable crop rotation system, so that things are planted in all seasons of the year. Last year, Chenqiao Society in Chao'an County, Guangdong, reached a summer planting index of 340%, and this year it can reach 400%, or even 440%. One mu of land can receive 1,200 to 1,300 jin of grain, plus more than 200 yuan in income from rotated economic crops. This experience proves that there is still a very rich potential in terms of cultivation systems. A reasonable cultivation system can not only produce more things, but also make the land more and more fertile, which is of great benefit to the growth of crops. Guangdong's sweet potato production also has great potential, and there are examples of high-yield areas with a large area of 15,000 to 20,000 jin per mu in various regions of the province. Therefore, earnestly grasping sweet potato production is another important way to rapidly increase grain production. In the past, we did not pay enough attention to this. Chairman Mao's instruction to "treat sweet potatoes as regular grain" has given us great inspiration and encouragement. At present, we have begun to vigorously grasp this link, mainly on the basis of water conservancy in dry land and sand into clay fields, systematically promoting the advanced cultivation experience in high-yield areas, and striving to receive an average of 3,000 to 4,000 jin per mu in the province this year.

In addition to reforming the cultivation system and grasping sweet potato production, the most important part of rapidly increasing grain production is to promote a series of technical measures centered on close planting to increase the yield per unit area of rice. According to Guangdong's experience, increasing the yield per unit area is to increase the number of ears, the number of grains, and the weight of grains per mu. Among them, increasing the number of ears is the most important. This requires close planting, reducing the row spacing of transplanting, and increasing the amount of seedlings used per mu, so that each plant has a certain number of branches to ensure the increase in the number of ears. If the row spacing is generally between four, five, and six inches, 20,000 to 25,000 plants can be planted per mu, and four or five branches are inserted in each plant. After tillering, each plant has ten ears, so at least 200,000 ears per mu can be achieved. If each ear can bear 50 grains of rice, then at least 500 jin of rice can be harvested per crop, and it is guaranteed to harvest 800 jin to 1,000 jin for the whole year. Guangdong's upper crop production this year is arranged according to this calculation, based on the experience of some high-yield areas in the province. Judging from the current growth of the seedlings, it cannot be said that this is wishful thinking, but it is possible to do it. The degree of close planting in the late crop this year is also planned to be larger, with an average of about 30,000 plants per mu, so that it is possible to reach about 300,000 ears per mu, making the leap in yield more guaranteed.

However, close planting itself does bring new contradictions, that is, the field is fertile, the seedlings are strong, and the planting is dense. If the management is not good, it may cause early dense ridges, lodging, reduced grains, and diseases due to strong growth and excessive tillering. Some people therefore conclude that fertile fields cannot be closely planted, strong seedlings cannot be closely planted, and only lean fields and weak seedlings can be closely planted. But how can lean fields and weak seedlings guarantee increased production even if they are closely planted? Obviously, they only see the problem from a negative perspective, not from a positive perspective. They do not want to solve the contradiction to achieve a new balance, but attempt to avoid the contradiction and restore the old balance. If we really do this, how can we move forward? Obviously, this is not the correct way. The correct way must be to have fertile fields, strong seedlings, and dense planting, and at the same time not lodging. For the new contradictions that arise here, new measures must be used to solve them. Experience has proven that we can completely solve these new contradictions and achieve a new balance by strengthening field management.

In the past, field management was called light agricultural work, and it was generally left to women and auxiliary labor to do. Traditionally, this period was regarded as the slack season. This concept must now be changed. The seedling stage of rice is about one month; the field stage is three months. During these three months, from the greening, tillering, pregnancy, jointing to the flowering, the harvest has not been finalized, and various natural conditions can affect it, and people's efforts can also affect it. The struggle between man and nature is very sharp. Relaxing field management means abandoning the subjective initiative of people, disarming people, and making rice powerless to the influence of natural conditions during the longest and most important period of growth. This is certainly very detrimental to increased production. Therefore, after spring plowing, the entire province of Guangdong is carrying out field management work with the same enthusiasm as water conservancy and fertilizer, and with the same determination to promote close planting, taking revolutionary measures to focus on the two links of scientific fertilization and scientific water use, that is, to promote "early growth and rapid development" of seedlings through early middle plowing and early topdressing, and to control ineffective tillering and prevent early dense ridges, lodging, reduced grains, and diseases through shallow water irrigation and timely drying of fields, so that the growth of seedlings can be controlled by artificial means and serve the purpose of increasing production.

To have close planting and to prevent lodging, in addition to the variety issue, the most important thing is to reform backward cultivation techniques as mentioned above. Can we quickly break through the technical reform barrier and ensure that grain production develops faster? The experience of the previous stage of spring plowing and production proves that as long as we resolutely implement Chairman Mao's instructions of "fully mobilizing the masses and everything through experimentation" and launch a mass technical reform movement, it is entirely possible.

Fully mobilize the masses, everything through experimentation,
	Launch a mass technical reform movement

There can be two lines for implementing technical reforms: one is the line of more, faster, better, and more economical, fully mobilizing the masses; the other is the line of less, slower, worse, and more expensive, engaging in reforms by a few people in isolation and stagnation. Practice has drawn the conclusion: the former line is correct, and the latter line is wrong. This year, the entire province of Guangdong transferred from the heavy agricultural basic construction to spring plowing in a very short time, but early sowing and early transplanting were universally promoted, more than 20 days earlier than in the past; all rice fields promoted close planting to varying degrees, with row spacing generally between four, five, and six inches, and the new technical specifications were quickly mastered by the masses, and the quality of spring plowing was very good, because most areas implemented the line of more, faster, better, and more economical. A few areas did not do this, and the technical reform was not vigorous or large-scale, so the results were poor. It can be seen from this that the line of more, faster, better, and more economical in technical reform is the line of fully mobilizing the masses. As long as we can turn technical reform into the actions of millions of masses, combine the determination of the leaders, the scientific knowledge of the technical personnel, the wisdom of the masses, and the revolutionary spirit, the technical reform movement can develop widely and rapidly. Once the movement is organized, the technical level of the masses can be quickly improved; endless inventions and creations can emerge in large quantities, and many complex and difficult problems in the science and technology departments can be answered from the practice of the masses.

The masses have an urgent need for technical reform, but there are also many ideological resistances. This puts forward the task of conducting in-depth ideological work for the mass technical reform movement. Farmers have production experience, but farmers' production experience is generally narrow. Many people not only only believe in past experience, but also only believe in the experience of their hometowns and themselves. For example, many people oppose early sowing, saying that "early sowing, the grain is ripe for the birds to eat"; some people doubt early transplanting, thinking that traditionally it has always been "early crop transplanting grain rain, late crop transplanting heat disposal"; "early transplanting is also great heat harvesting, late transplanting is also great heat harvesting"; some people do not approve of close planting, saying that "sparse rice has grain to sell, dense rice has straw to burn," and so on. However, experience has proven that as long as in-depth ideological work can be carried out, most farmers can completely abandon the old rules passed down by their ancestors and accept advanced technical measures. Judging from the situation in Guangdong, the masses probably have three different attitudes towards technical reform: some people have direct and indirect experience in technical reform or believe in science and technology, so they firmly believe in technical reform; most people have no experience with new technical measures and do not understand them well, so they are half-believing and half-doubting; and some people are limited to narrow experience, or have had failed lessons but have not drawn the correct conclusions, so they are full of doubts. The first type of people are activists in technical reform, and they walk after understanding; the second type of people generally walk and understand, and the more they walk, the more they understand, and most of them will continue to become activists; as for the third type of people, some will walk and understand, and some will temporarily walk but not understand, and will go through a relatively long process of practice. The responsibility of the leaders is to quickly dispel the doubts of the masses, shorten the process of the masses accepting advanced technology, and let the masses promote advanced technology themselves.

In order to quickly launch a mass technical reform movement, what problems need to be solved?

First, use the methods of more, faster, better, and more economical to promote advanced technology. In Guangdong, this is to combine case education with ideological debate, carry out layer-by-layer demonstration, organize visits, on-site debates, and summarize local high-yield experience. For example, for transplanting rice, first conduct a search for high yields among cadres and members of counties, townships, and societies, and see whether dense planting has increased production or sparse planting has increased production under the same conditions in history? After finding examples of high-yield dense planting, immediately launch debates among cadres and the masses, and at the same time set technical specifications requirements, conduct layer-by-layer trial transplanting in the experimental fields of cadres at the county, township, and society levels, and let cadres and the masses visit, practice, debate, revise the specifications requirements, and check the quality of transplanting. Then, comprehensively spread out and implement it. This can not only achieve a technical leap, but also prevent coercion and commandism, quickly understand the ideology, quickly impart technology, unify quality requirements, and solve ideological problems and technical problems in one fell swoop. It can launch a mass technical reform movement in a very short period of time and implement technical measures to the end. At present, the province is carrying out field management work in the same way.

Second, quickly form a technical team. This team is currently mainly impossible and should not wait for the agricultural science and technology departments to train it, but must be discovered and trained from production and from the masses. According to Guangdong's experience, this technical team should be composed of township and society cadres, production team leaders, technical personnel, and some experienced and courageous old farmers, and mainly composed of activists in technical reform. Among the three parts of the backbone, the cadres are in charge, have politics and power, the technical personnel have scientific and technological knowledge, and the old farmers have production experience. Three cobblers make a Zhuge Liang. In this way, a technical team that is both red and expert, has direction, has energy, has knowledge, and has experience can be formed. Relying on such a team to carry out technical reform can overcome right-leaning conservative thinking and prevent unrealistic shortcomings. This team in Guangdong more commonly adopts the form of agricultural technical night schools and agricultural middle schools, which are the main forms of technical revolution and cultural revolution in rural areas. At present, many cooperatives in the province have developed larger-scale experimental farms on the basis of experimental fields, combining technical night schools, agricultural middle schools, and experimental farms into one, learning scientific knowledge while conducting more extensive experiments on varieties and cultivation methods. The characteristics of these forms are the unification of production and research, the unification of work and study, and the unification of teaching, learning, and doing. A technical night school and agricultural middle school are at the same time a demonstration production team, an experimental farm, and a technical guidance station, becoming the base point for carrying out technical innovation, cultural revolution, and guiding production in rural areas. This organization has unlimited vitality and broad prospects. It is completely predictable that thousands of modern Shennongs and Li Bings, Chinese Michurins and Williams will be trained here, and will play an immeasurable role in the socialist agricultural technical revolution.

Third, leaders and cadres at all levels must quickly become both red and expert. After last year's rural socialist education and this year's great leap in production, the vast number of cadres have a deep understanding of being both red and expert, and deeply feel the serious significance of "ideology is the soul, and politics is the commander." A specialist who is not red has no soul and will inevitably lose direction. Therefore, the province's work must continue to grasp politics and strengthen political and ideological education in all work departments; at the same time, we also deeply feel that being red without understanding the actual situation is indeed fake red, has no say in production, and cannot lead production well. Therefore, since this year, a trend of studying technology has begun to form throughout the province, determined to delve into it in the shortest possible time and become an expert. Our experience is that not only must the specialization be deep and red, but the red must be deeply specialized; and only by correctly combining red and specialization can cadres make unprecedented progress in politics and business. For example, once leading cadres at all levels begin to recognize the study of technology, they can immediately play a huge role in promoting production. The leaders and the masses are more in tune, the cadres' hesitation on technical reform has stopped, the mass technical reform movement has been organized, and the specific measures for the great leap in production have been taken, and the work situation has been completely renewed. Similarly, once scientific and technical personnel walk out of their laboratories, go to the masses, go to production, and truly combine scientific research with current production to serve production, and take summarizing the rich production experience of the masses as their main task, then scientific and technical personnel will not only achieve great political progress, but will inevitably draw valuable experience from the practice of the masses and greatly enrich agricultural science. At present, Guangdong is universally promoting the method of conducting systematic experiments on various technical measures through experimental fields, the method of deploying work and learning technology through on-site meetings, the method of summarizing high-yield experience and learning technology through visits and evaluations, and the method of organizing technical personnel to go to production and conduct research in conjunction with production. We believe that these methods are not only the mass line for promoting advanced technology, but also the correct way to train cadres to quickly become both red and expert. This is of great significance for launching a mass technical innovation movement and ensuring that grain production develops faster.

Large-scale improvement of agricultural tools, putting agricultural production
	Turning to a new technical basis

In order to rapidly develop grain production, there is another contradiction to be solved, that is, improving agricultural tools, realizing agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, and improving labor efficiency. Due to the large-scale development of water, soil, and fertilizer and the large-scale development of close planting, the workload has increased by one time or even several times, and expanding multiple cropping and intercropping and implementing large-scale water and dry land rotation have further increased the seasonal tension of labor. The question now is: should we take a step forward to reform agricultural tools on a large scale, improve labor efficiency, and ensure the implementation of production-increasing measures? Or should we take a step back, lower technical requirements, and achieve a balance in labor? The vigorous agricultural tool reform movement that has been developing throughout Guangdong since last winter and this spring has answered this question: we must move forward! Our current task is to widely and deeply develop this movement in all aspects. We must closely integrate with production, reform whatever agricultural tools we are doing, and systematically reform tillage tools, transportation tools, water lifting tools, and processing tools, from rough to fine, and from simple to complex; we must summarize, appraise, evaluate, and improve the inventions and creations of the masses through exhibitions, and then comprehensively promote them; in particular, we must manufacture a large number of improved agricultural tools around the upcoming summer harvest and summer planting to solve the acute contradiction of insufficient labor.

The agricultural tool reform movement has now begun to show signs of developing towards agricultural mechanization. In order to ensure the more rapid development of grain production, we must put the issue of achieving agricultural mechanization ahead of schedule on the agenda of the Guangdong Party organization. In the past, some people thought that there were many paddy fields in the south and that mechanization could not be implemented, and that there were many people and little land in the south, and that there was a surplus of labor, so there was no need to rush to implement mechanization. These arguments are incorrect. The development of agricultural production ultimately depends on the development of agricultural production tools, and the south is of course no exception. Judging from the situation in Guangdong, tractors can be used in paddy fields, and the masses are also eager to realize mechanization ahead of schedule. They say, "For mechanization, we are not afraid to only issue rations." Cadres and the masses in many areas have launched an investment donation movement to accumulate for the realization of agricultural mechanization. According to our calculations, agricultural cooperatives can rely on their own accumulation to purchase machinery, and Guangdong's industrial technology conditions can also accelerate the arrival of agricultural mechanization. Therefore, it is entirely possible to strive to basically achieve mechanization and semi-mechanization in Guangdong in three to five years.

    粮食生产速度可以加快
    中共广东省委书记处书记　赵紫阳
    少奇同志的报告中根据我国人民建设实践的丰富经验，论证了我们完全有可能在历史上最短的时期内在我国实现最深刻的变革，建成社会主义。这对我们是一个极大的鼓舞。究竟我们能否按照多快好省的要求，以更快的速度发展粮食生产呢？从广东这几年来特别是去冬今春以来的经验看，是完全可能的。广东在第一个五年计划期间虽然只增产了粮食五十五亿斤，增加了29％，速度不快，但如果加以分析，就可以看出这里面是有原因的。原来在这五十五亿斤中，有三十亿斤是在合作化前三年基本上依靠土改中和土改后小农经济的积极性增产的；而在合作化那一年，虽是一手办社一手生产，年成又不算好，却增产了二十亿斤；去年广东由于闹地方主义和反“冒进”的影响，生产劲头大大减退，年成并不算坏，但只增产了五亿斤。可是去冬今春以来大跃进的形势，使农业生产情况出现前所未有的局面。仅今年春收作物就翻了两翻，增产了二十亿斤，现在已经拿到手。而春收作物在广东全年粮食总产量中的比重是不大的，主要收获物靠两造水稻。上造水稻经过早播、早插、密植和加强田间管理等一系列的技术措施之后，禾苗生长很好，绝大部分都可达到每亩二十万穗。下造水稻历来比较稳定，又有上造实行技术改革的经验，估计一定会搞得更好。还有，蕃茨潜力很大，只要认真抓一下，至少可以跃进一倍。这样看来，只要我们扎扎实实地工作，而不碰上特别大的自然灾害，实现广东粮食增产的第二本账即全年增产六十亿斤的指标是完全有把握的。搞得好还会大大超过。根据我们最近的计算，广东有极大可能在明年最迟在后年成为粮食八百斤省。这样，提前全部实现农业发展纲要四十条就有了可靠的基础。
    实现粮食高产的经验，在广东已经有了。还在去年，全省就已有十二个县市平均产量达到八百斤乃至一千斤以上，另外，还有为数不少的乡、社也已经达到这个指标。这些地区今后如何获得再高产，是需要进一步创造经验的。但就全省大多数地区来说，达到亩产八百斤或一千斤已经不是有无经验的问题，而是如何把已有的经验迅速普及，坚决贯彻执行的问题。
  加快粮食生产速度的根本条件是：
    过好水、土、肥三关，猛攻技术关
    根据广东的经验，要使粮食从低产迅速变为高产需要具备那些根本条件呢？第一、要看我们能否迅速过好水、土、肥这三关；第二、有了水、土、肥，还要看我们能否迅速采取一套良好的耕作技术与耕作制度。二者不可缺一。
    水、土、肥是农业生产的基础，这三关不过，就没有条件谈技术改革。这一点农民是很清楚的。他们说：“水是禾苗血，没它了不得”，“长嘴的要吃，长根的要肥”，又说：“好田长好禾，坏田长稗草”。可见水、土、肥十分重要。但是，只具备水、土、肥的条件，而没有良好的耕作技术与耕作制度，仍然不能获得高产。广东有无数事实证明，在同等的水、土、肥的基础上，仅仅由于耕作技术有先进与落后之分，产量就悬殊很大。因此，当我们改变了自然条件，为作物创造了良好的水、土、肥基础的同时，还必须在耕作技术与耕作制度方面紧紧跟上去，才能充分发挥水、土、肥的作用，迅速获得高产。
    水、土、肥的重要性人们是比较容易认识的。只要坚决发动群众，鼓足干劲，水、土、肥这几关可以在短时期内突破，这已为各地的经验所证明。广东目前全省粮食耕地大约有一半左右的水利设备已达到每亩供水五百公方的标准，彻底消灭了旱灾；有四分之一以上具备了供水三百至四百公方的标准，消灭了普通旱灾；供水不到三百公方的已不足四分之一，其中没有水利设备的仅剩8％。积肥也有很大跃进，今年春耕平均每亩有肥四百担，全省农业社推广了制造混合肥和速效肥的办法，再加上利用间作复种大量种植绿肥之后，肥料供应也有了比较可靠的基础。全省经过大规模的改良土壤，低产田已由一千五百万亩下降到九百万亩，一部分中产田现已成为高产田。总的说来，按照亩产粮食八百斤至一千斤的要求，水、土、肥三关，全省有一部分地区已经过好了，大部分地区正在过，秋前可以过好，还有一部分地区明年春耕前也可过好。
    但是群众对改革耕作技术和耕作制度的看法却并不一致，这里存在着先进与落后，革新与保守的思想斗争。因为过去落后的耕作技术与耕作制度是在小农经济的基础上产生并与落后的水、土、肥条件相适应的，而人们的思想又总是落后于现实，因此，尽管水、土、肥的条件已经有了很大的变化，但是传统的耕作习惯对于刚从个体经济中解放出来的农民还有着极其深厚的影响。这样便产生了比较好的水、土、肥条件和未能与之相适应的耕作技术条件之间的矛盾。这个矛盾向党提出了十分迫切的任务：必须抓技术。今春以来，广东全党的注意力开始转到这方面来，目前正全力攻打技术关。这一段工作证明，只要书记动手，全党动员，充分发动群众，技术关也完全可以像水、土、肥关一样，被我们迅速攻下。
    为了在短期内达到亩产粮食八百斤，我们在耕作技术与耕作制度的改革方面抓紧了哪些措施呢？改革耕作制度，提高复种、间复指数，这仍然是很重要的途径。广东不仅可以在今年冬季基本实现一年三熟，而且今后还要利用上下两造之间的夏季休闲，种植绿肥和薯类，高度地利用土地，最合理地实行轮种制度，使一年四季都种上东西。广东潮安县陈桥社去年的夏种指数达到百分之三百四十，今年可以达到百分之四百，甚至百分之四百四十，一亩地可以收到一千二百至一千三百斤的粮食，加上轮种的经济作物可收入二百多元。这个经验证明，在耕作制度方面还有十分丰富的潜力。合理的耕作制度不仅可以生产更多的东西，而且土地将越种越肥，对作物的生长有很大好处。广东的蕃茨生产也大有可为，大面积亩产一万五千斤至二万斤以上的丰产事例全省各区都有。因此，认真抓好蕃茨生产，这又是使粮食生产迅速提高的另一个重要途径。过去我们对此重视不够，毛主席提出“要把蕃茨作正粮”的指示后，给我们很大的启示与鼓舞。目前我们已经开始大力抓这一环，主要是在旱地水利化、粘土田入沙的基础上，系统推广高产地区的先进栽培经验，在今年内力争全省每亩平均收到三、四千斤。
    除了改革耕作制度和抓紧蕃茨生产以外，粮食迅速增产的最主要的一环，是推广以密植为中心的一系列的技术措施，提高水稻的单位面积产量。根据广东的经验，提高单位面积产量就是增加每一播种亩的穗数、粒数和粒重，其中首先增加穗数最为重要。这就必须实行密植，缩小插秧的株行距，同时增加每亩田的用秧量，使每科有一定的条数，保证穗数增加。如果株行距一般在四、五、六寸之间，每亩能栽上二万科至二万五千科，每科插四、五条，分蘖后每科有十穗，至少就能使每亩有二十万穗，每穗如能结五十粒谷，那么一造至少就可收谷五百斤，全年收八百斤至一千斤便有了保证。广东今年上造生产就是根据本省一些高产地区的这个经验，按照这种计算来安排的。从目前禾苗生长的情况看来，不能说这是一种如意算盘，而是可能做到的。今年晚造密植的程度还准备再大一些，每亩平均植到三万株左右，这样每亩就有可能达到三十万穗左右，使得产量的跃进更有保证。
    但是，密植本身也确实带来新的矛盾，这就是田肥、秧壮而又密植，如果管理不好，可能因生势旺分蘖多而早期密陇、倒伏、减粒和发生病害。有些人因此得出结论说：肥田不能密植，壮秧不能密植，可以密植的只能是瘦田、弱秧。但是瘦田、弱秧即使密植了又如何能够保证增产呢？很显然，他们只从消极方面看问题，不是从积极方面看问题。不是想从解决矛盾来达到新的平衡，而是企图回避矛盾回复旧的平衡。如果真是这样做了，我们怎样能够前进呢？很显然，这不是正确的途径。正确的途径必须是既要田肥，又要壮秧，同时要密植，而又不倒伏。对于这里所产生的新的矛盾，要用新的措施去解决它。经验证明：我们完全可以通过加强田间管理来解决这些新的矛盾，实现新的平衡。
    田间管理在过去被称为轻便农活，一般都交给妇女和附带劳动力去做，习惯上都把这一段看作农闲季节。这种观念现在要改变过来。水稻的秧田生长期大约一个月；本田生长期则有三个月，而在本田中从回青、分蘖、孕穗、拔节直到扬花这两个半月的时间内，收成一直没有定局，各种自然条件可以影响它，人们的努力也同样可以影响它，人与自然的斗争是很尖锐的。放松田间管理，就意味着放弃人的主观能动作用，解除人的武装，使水稻在生长期最长、最重要的时刻，对自然条件的影响处在无能为力的情况之下。这样，对增产当然是十分不利的。因此，春耕之后，广东全省正以搞水利、肥料的劲头和推广密植的决心，采取革命措施来开展田间管理工作，突出抓住科学用肥和科学用水这两个环节，即是要通过早中耕早追肥，促进禾苗“早生快发”，又要通过浅水勤灌、适时晒田的办法，控制无效分蘖，防止早期密垅、倒伏、减粒和病害，使禾苗的生长能为人工所控制，服从于增产的目的。
    又要密植，又要防止倒伏，除了品种问题之外，最主要的就是如前所述要改革落后的耕作技术。究竟我们能否迅速突破技术改革关，保证粮食生产更快地向前发展呢？前一段春耕生产的经验证明：只要坚决贯彻毛主席指示的“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的方针，掀起群众性的技术改革运动，是完全可以办得到的。
    放手发动群众，一切经过试验，
    掀起群众性技术改革运动
    实行技术改革可以有两条路线：一条是多、快、好、省，放手发动群众的路线；一条是少、慢、差、费，由少数人孤立静止地搞改革的路线。实践已经作出了结论：前一条路线是正确的，后一条路线是错误的。今年广东全省从繁重的农田基本建设转上春耕，时间很短，但是普遍推行了早播早插，比过去提前二十多天；全部稻田都在不同程度上推广了密植，株行距一般在四、五、六寸之间，而新的技术规格却能迅速为群众所掌握，春耕质量很好，就是因为多数地区贯彻了多、快、好、省路线的缘故。有少数地区没有这样做，技术改革就没有声势，没有规模，因而成绩就差。由此可见，技术改革中的多快好省的路线就是放手发动群众的路线，只要能够把技术改革变成千百万群众的行动，把领导的决心，技术人员的科学知识，群众的聪明才智和革命劲头结合起来，技术改革运动就能够广泛迅速地向前发展。而运动一经组织起来，群众的技术水平就能够很快得到提高；无穷无尽的发明创造就可以大量涌现出来，科学技术部门的许多复杂疑难问题也能够从群众的实践中得到解答。
    群众对技术改革有迫切要求，但是又有不少思想抵触，这就给群众性的技术改革运动提出了深入进行思想工作的任务。农民是有生产经验的，但是农民的生产经验一般是狭窄的。许多人不仅只相信过去的经验，而且只相信本乡本土和自己的经验。譬如有许多人就反对早播，说什么“播种播得早，禾熟喂雀鸟”；还有些人怀疑早插，认为历来都是“早造插谷雨，晚造插处暑”；“早插也是大暑收割，迟插也是大暑收割”；也有人不赞成密植，说什么“疏禾有谷粜，密禾有秆烧”等等。但是，经验证明，只要能够深入进行思想工作，大多数农民是完全可以抛弃老祖宗传下来的老规矩，接受先进的技术措施的。从广东的情况看来，群众对技术改革大概有三种不同的态度：一部分人有技术改革的直接经验和间接经验或相信科学技术，因而他们对技术改革深信不疑；大部分人对新的技术措施没有经验也不大了解，似懂非懂，因而半信半疑；还有一部分人则局限于狭隘经验，或有过失败教训但没有得出正确结论，因而满腹狐疑。第一种人是技术改革的积极分子，他们是通而后走的；第二种人大体是边走边通，越走越通的，他们中的大部分人将不断成为积极分子；至于第三种人，一部分将边走边通，还有一部分则暂时走而不通，要经过一个比较长的实践过程。领导的责任就是要迅速打消群众疑虑，缩短群众接受先进技术的过程，让群众自己动手推广先进技术。
    为了迅速掀起群众性的技术改革运动，需要解决那些问题呢？
    第一，要采用又多又快又好又省的办法来推广先进技术。这在广东就是把实例教育和思想辩论结合起来，进行层层示范、组织参观、现场辩论和总结当地高产经验的办法。例如插秧，首先在县、乡、社干部和社员中进行查高产，看一看历史上在同等条件下到底是密植增产还是疏植增产？找出密植高产事例之后，立即在干部和群众中开展辩论，同时订出技术规格要求，在县、乡、社各级干部的试验田里进行层层试插，让干部和群众一边参观，一边练习，一边辩论，一边修订规格要求，一边检查插秧质量。然后全面铺开，贯彻执行。这样做既可以实现技术跃进，又可以防止强迫命令，既能很快弄通思想，又能很快传授技术，统一质量要求，一举而解决思想问题和技术问题，能在很短的时间内掀起群众性的技术改革运动，把技术措施贯彻到底。当前全省开展田间管理工作，也是采取了这个办法的。
    第二，要迅速组成一支技术队伍。这支队伍目前主要不可能也不应当等待农业科学技术部门来培养，而必须从生产中，从群众中发现培养。根据广东的经验，这支技术队伍要由乡、社干部与生产队长、技术人员和一些富有经验又勇于改革的老农这三部分人为骨干，以技术改革的积极分子为主力联合组成。三部分骨干中，干部是当家的，有政治又有权力，技术人员有科学技术知识，老农有生产经验。三个臭皮匠，合成诸葛亮。这样就能凑成一支又红又专，有方向、有劲头，又有知识、有经验的技术队伍。依靠这样的队伍去进行技术改革，就可以克服右倾保守思想，又能防止不切实际的缺点。这支队伍在广东比较普遍的是采用农业技术夜校和农业中学的形式，这是农村进行技术革命和文化革命的主要形式。目前全省有许多合作社在试验田的基础上发展起来规模较大的试验农场，把学技术的夜校、农业中学和试验场结合为一，一边学习科学知识，一边进行比较广泛的品种和栽治方法的试验。这些形式的特点是生产与研究统一，工作与学习统一，教、学、做统一。一所技术夜校、农业中学，同时又是示范生产队，又是试验场，又是技术指导站，成为农村开展技术革新、文化革命、指导生产的基点。这种组织具有无限的生命力和广阔的前途，完全可以预料，在这里将培养成千上万现代的神农与李冰，中国的米丘林与威廉士，在社会主义的农业技术革命中起到不可估量的作用。
    第三，各级领导和干部要迅速做到又红又专。经过去年的农村社会主义教育和今年的生产大跃进，广大干部对又红又专有了深刻的体会，深深感到“思想是灵魂，政治是统帅”的严重意义。不红的专是没有灵魂的，必然要迷失方向，因此全省工作今后必须继续抓政治，在一切工作部门中加强政治思想教育；同时我们又深深感到不懂得实际的红确实是假红，对生产没有发言权，不可能把生产领导好，因此今年以来全省上下开始形成一种钻研技术的风气，下定决心，务必要在最短的时间内钻进去，成为内行。我们的体会是：不仅专深必须红透，红透必须专深；而且只有把红与专正确结合起来，干部才能以空前的速度获得政治上和业务上的进步。例如，各级领导干部一旦开始认识钻研技术，就能立即对生产起到巨大的推动作用，领导与群众更加通气了，干部对技术改革的摇摆现象停止了，群众性的技术改革运动组织起来了，生产大跃进的具体措施也有了，工作局面就焕然一新。同样，科学技术人员一旦走出自己的试验室，到群众中去，到生产中去，真正把科学研究工作和当前生产结合起来，为生产服务，把总结群众丰富的生产经验作为自己的主要任务，那么科学技术人员就不仅要获得政治上的巨大进步，而且必然要从群众的实践中吸取宝贵的经验，大大丰富农业科学。目前广东各地正普遍推广通过试验田对各种技术措施实行系统试验的办法，通过现场会议，既布置工作又学习技术的办法，通过参观评比，总结丰产经验，学习技术的办法，以及组织技术人员到生产中去结合生产进行研究的办法。我们认为，这些办法不仅是推广先进技术的群众路线，也是培养干部迅速做到又红又专的正确途径。这对掀起群众性的技术革新运动，保证粮食生产更快地向前发展，有着十分重大的意义。
    大规模改良农具，把农业生产
      转到新的技术基础上
    为了迅速发展粮食生产，还有另一个方面的矛盾要加以解决，这就是改良农具，实现农业机械化、半机械化，提高劳动效率的问题。由于大搞水、土、肥和大搞密植，工作量已经增加到一倍乃至几倍，扩大复种间种和实行大规模的水旱轮作更增加了劳动力的季节性的紧张。现在的问题是：前进一步大规模地改革农具，提高劳动效率，保证增产措施的贯彻呢？还是后退一步，降低技术要求，取得劳动力的平衡呢？去冬今春以来广东全省蓬蓬勃勃地开展着的农具改革运动已经回答了这个问题：必须前进！当前我们的任务就是要把这个运动广泛地深入地向各方面发展。要密切结合生产，做什么农活就改什么农具，务必要把耕作工具，运输工具，提水工具，加工工具，从粗到细，从简到繁地系统地加以改革；要通过展览会把群众的发明创造加以总结、鉴定、评比、提高，然后再全面推广；特别要围绕着即将到来的夏收夏种，制造大量的改良农具，解决劳动力不足的尖锐矛盾。
    农具改革运动现在已经开始显露出向农业机械化发展的苗头。为了保证粮食生产更迅速地发展，我们必须把提前实现农业机械化的问题提到广东党组织的议事日程上来。过去有人认为南方水田多，不能实行机械化，南方人多地少，劳动力有剩余，不必急于实行机械化。这些论点是不对的。农业生产的发展归根到底取决于农业生产工具的发展，南方当然不能例外。从广东情况看，水田可以使用拖拉机，群众也迫切要求提前实现机械化，他们说“为了机械化，光发口粮也不怕”，许多地区的干部和群众已经掀起了为实现农业机械化而积累的投资捐献运动。根据我们的计算，农业社可以依靠自己的积累购买机械，广东的工业技术条件也可以加速农业机械化的到来。因此，在广东争取在三、五年内基本实现机械化和半机械化是完全可能的。
