    Tianjin University Helps Tangshan Build New Factories

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Tianjin University has sent professors to help Tangshan City develop local industry and build new factories. In order to make full use of coal, Tangshan City will build a chemical coking plant this year. The coke produced by this coking plant is only a byproduct, the main products are valuable raw materials such as coal tar and gas. However, the local industrial departments in Tangshan City could not design this new science and technology themselves. The difficulty was great. After contact, Tianjin University was willing to provide technical support. On April 16, the university sent two professors and one teaching assistant to Tangshan City to conduct specific research and to observe the site. They made a general arrangement for how to arrange the plant site, and they have agreed to take on the entire design.

    天津大学帮助唐山建设新工厂
    本报讯　天津大学派出教授帮助唐山市地方工业建设新工厂。为了充分发挥煤的作用，在今年唐山市将兴建一座化学炼焦厂。这座炼焦厂的焦炭只是副产品，主要的产品是出产炼焦油、煤气等贵重原料。但是对这种新的科学技术，唐山市地方工业部门自己不能设计。困难很大。经过联系，天津大学愿从技术上给以支持。4月16日该校派了两位教授和一位助教到唐山市进行具体研究，并到现场进行观察。对厂址如何布置作了大体安排，他们已答应将全部设计包下来。
