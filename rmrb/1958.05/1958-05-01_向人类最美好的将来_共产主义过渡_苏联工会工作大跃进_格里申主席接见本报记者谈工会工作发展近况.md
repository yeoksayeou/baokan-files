Toward the Most Beautiful Future of Mankind—Communism
    Great Leap Forward in Soviet Trade Union Work
    Chairman Grishin Receives Our Newspaper Reporter to Discuss Recent Developments in Trade Union Work

    (Our newspaper, Moscow, 30th dispatch) Recently, Chairman Grishin of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions received our newspaper reporter and spoke about the recent developments in the work of Soviet trade unions.

    Chairman Grishin first talked about the situation and achievements of the Soviet trade unions in implementing the December resolution of the CPSU Central Committee last year on "Further Enhancing the Role of Trade Unions." He said: "The December resolution of the CPSU Central Committee last year was an extremely important resolution. It not only once again clearly defined the position and role of trade unions during the transition to communism, but also expanded their legal and powerful position. Since the promulgation of the December resolution last year, the importance and concern of all levels of party organizations and the people of the whole country for trade union work have been universally improved. Now, trade unions at all levels across the country have formulated specific plans and are struggling to implement this resolution in their various tasks. All of this has opened up broad prospects for the further development of trade union work. Since January of this year, trade unions at all levels in the Soviet Union, from the central to the local levels, have held meetings one after another, and everyone has carried out a series of tasks centered on implementing this resolution. All the meetings unanimously pointed out that the central task of trade union work in the future should be to strive for the vigorous development of industrial and agricultural production, accelerate and complete production plans ahead of schedule, and reduce costs. To complete this overall task, trade unions must simultaneously carry out work in the following aspects: Regularly and accurately grasp the production situation of factories and mines, earnestly study the labor competitions carried out by the factories and mines themselves, among similar factories and mines, and among economic regions; formulate realistic work quotas and rational wage systems on the basis of investigation and research, and effectively lead the rationalization proposals and inventions movements of factories and mines. In short, since December last year, Soviet trade unions have made a great leap forward, both in terms of the scope and depth of their work. Some unrealistic and formalistic shortcomings that existed in the past have also been basically overcome."

    Grishin continued: "At present, trade unions have also made many improvements in further improving the living welfare of the working people and carrying out political and cultural education. Due to the expansion of the powers of trade unions, trade unions at all levels have the right to check the progress of residential construction and equipment conditions, and at the same time, they also have the right to participate in the allocation of housing. In order to ensure the health of workers, trade unions also have the right to inspect various agencies related to workers' lives and health, such as commercial institutions, medical institutions, and canteens. In terms of workers' political education, the current focus is on strengthening education on labor discipline and protecting state property. Similarly, the powers of local trade unions have also been expanded. Some issues that the primary trade unions had no right to decide in the past can now be resolved by themselves. In the recent period, while expanding the powers and roles of primary trade unions, the simplification of the central organizations of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions will be considered."

    Chairman Grishin then talked about the issue of workers' participation in the democratic management of factories, which has developed on a new basis since the December resolution of the CPSU Central Committee. He said: "The movement of workers' participation in the democratic management of factories, which has been carried out since December last year, has made good progress and has achieved great results. The production of factories and mines has been generally improved. The basic form of workers' participation in the democratic management of factories is the organization of production meetings. There are two types of these production meetings: the entire factory and the local workshop. They are composed of representatives from the workshop, administration, party, league, and trade union, with a term of one year. The issues they discuss include the following aspects: formulating production plans, supervising the implementation of plans, determining product quality, improving labor productivity, studying the labor conditions of workers, improving technology, stipulating work and wage quotas, and inspecting labor protection conditions. Production meetings can also put forward opinions on the factory's administrative work and personnel system. In short, the opinions of production meetings should be implemented immediately as long as they are beneficial to promoting production and do not violate factory legislation. If the decisions of the production meeting differ from the opinions of the factory administration and the problem is difficult to handle at present, the higher-level trade union and the government can be consulted to resolve it. Of course, there are other forms of absorbing workers to participate in the democratic management of factories, such as inviting heads of economic organs to report to trade unions regularly, or trade unions regularly discussing economic issues, and workers participating in the work of the National Economic Council, etc. According to the spirit of the December resolution, production plans should be fully based on the opinions of workers. The current production plan is actually jointly formulated by four agencies: the enterprise trade union, the factory federation, the National Economic Council, and the local Soviet. The organization of production meetings by various industrial and mining enterprises and the widespread attraction of workers to participate in the democratic management of factories have made the workers' production enthusiasm generally high, and the production outlook has also undergone great changes."

    Chairman Grishin finally talked about the current situation of trade unions carrying out rationalization proposals and technological innovation movements. He said: "The movement of rationalization proposals has been widely carried out. In the past year, more than one million technical inventors and rationalization proposers have put forward more than two million proposals. Up to now, more than 1.5 million have been put into practice, saving the country nearly 7 billion rubles in production funds. But now we are not satisfied with this and must continue to work hard. We have recently decided to convene a meeting of the heads of the All-Union Scientific and Technological Association, requesting scientific workers to study and promote new technologies, and requesting them to make new contributions to the automation, mechanization, and labor protection of factories and mines. In order to effectively lead the national rationalization proposal and technological innovation movement, the Soviet Union has now formed a national association of rationalization proposers and inventors, publishes publications, and uses it to exchange experiences of creation and invention from all over the country." At the end of the conversation, Chairman Grishin said: "While further improving the role of trade union work, Soviet trade unions will make every effort to strengthen international ties with trade unions in various countries around the world, especially to strengthen ties with trade unions in socialist countries. The Soviet trade unions regard the fraternal ties with the Chinese trade unions as the most important foundation for maintaining the unity of the world trade union movement, defending world peace, and striving for human happiness. As the working people of the world are greeting the glorious "May Day" with their actions, the Soviet trade unions and all the Soviet working people are willing to congratulate the Chinese trade unions and the fraternal Chinese working people with brotherly friendship. May the Chinese working class achieve more brilliant achievements in his great socialist construction."

    向人类最美好的将来——共产主义过渡
    苏联工会工作大跃进
    格里申主席接见本报记者谈工会工作发展近况
    本报莫斯科30日电　日前，全苏工会中央理事会主席格里申接见了本报记者，就苏联工会工作最近发展的情况与记者作了谈话。
    格里申主席首先谈到了苏联工会在贯彻苏共中央全会去年12月决议“进一步提高工会工作的作用”的一些情况和已获得的成就。他说：“苏共中央去年12月的决议，是一个极其重要的决议，它不但再一次地明确地确定了工会在向共产主义过渡时期的地位与作用，而且亦扩大了工会在法律和权力上的地位。去年12月决议公布以后，全党各级机关以及全国人民对工会工作的重视和关心是普遍提高了。现在，全国各级工会都已订出了具体计划并在自己的各项工作中为贯彻这一决议而进行斗争。这一切都给进一步发展工会工作开辟了广阔的前途。今年1月以来，苏联的各级工会，从中央一直到地方，纷纷举行了会议，大家都围绕着为贯彻这一决议进行了一系列的工作。所有的会议都一致指出，今后工会工作中心任务应该是：为大力发展工农业生产、加速和提前完成生产计划和降低成本而斗争。要完成这个总的任务，工会就必须在以下几方面同时展开工作：要经常地确切掌握厂矿的生产情况，切实研究厂矿本身、同类厂矿之间以及经济区之间展开的劳动竞赛；要在调查研究的基础上实事求是地规定工作定额，制订合理的工资制度，并切实有效地领导厂矿的合理化建议和创造发明运动。总之，苏联工会从去年12月以来，无论就它的工作的面和工作的深度来讲，都已大大跃进了一步。过去工作中存在着的一些不切合实际和形式主义的毛病也已得到基本的克服。”
    格里申接着说：“目前，工会在进一步提高劳动人民的生活福利、进行政治和文化教育等方面也都有了不少改进。由于工会权力的扩大，各级工会有权去检查住宅建筑的进展情况和设备条件，同时也有权参加房屋的分配工作。为了确保工人的健康，工会还有权去检查与工人生活和健康有关的各种机关，如商业机构、医疗机关和食堂等等。在工人的政治教育方面，目前集中注意加强劳动纪律和爱护国家财产的教育。同样，地方工会的权力也扩大了，以前有些基层工会无权决定的问题，现在可以自己去解决了。最近一个时期内，与扩大基层工会的权力与作用同时，将考虑全苏工会中央组织的精简问题。”
    格里申主席接着谈到了苏共中央全会12月决议以后在新的基础上发展起来的工人参加工厂民主管理问题。他说：“去年12月后所开展起来的工人参加工厂的民主管理的运动，进展得很好，而且已经得到很大的成效。厂矿生产普遍得到了提高。工人参加工厂民主管理的基本形式是组织生产会议，这种生产会议有整个工厂的和局部车间的两种，由车间、行政、党、团和工会的代表组成，期限一年。他们讨论的问题有以下几方面：制订生产计划，监督计划执行，规定产品质量，提高劳动生产率，研究工人的劳动情况，提高技术，规定工作和工资定额，检查劳保情况等。生产会议还可以对工厂行政工作，人事制度等方面提出意见。总之，生产会议的意见只要对促进生产有利，只要不违背工厂立法，就应当立即实行。生产会议的决议倘与工厂行政的意见有分歧而目前问题又难于处理时，可找上一级工会和政府解决。当然，吸收工人参加工厂民主管理，还有其它的形式，如邀请经济机关负责人定期到工会作报告，或工会定期讨论经济问题，以及工人参加国民经济委员会的工作等等。根据12月决议的精神，生产计划应该充分根据工人的意见来制订。现在的生产计划实际上是企业工会、工厂联合会、国民经济委员会与地方苏维埃四个机关共同拟订的。各工矿企业组织生产会议和广泛吸引工人参加工厂民主管理，已经使得工人的生产热情普遍高涨，生产面貌也发生了很大的变化。”
    格里申主席最后谈到目前工会开展合理化建议和技术革新运动的一些情况。他说：“合理化建议的运动现已广泛开展起来，去年一年中，共有一百多万名技术发明家和合理化建议者提出了二百多万条建议。到目前为止，已有一百五十多万条付诸实现，为国家节约了将近七十亿卢布的生产资金。但现在我们并不满足这一点，还要继续努力。我们最近已决定要召开一次全苏科学技术协会的负责人会议，要求科学工作者研究和推广新技术，要求他们为厂矿的自动化、机械化、劳动保护等方面作出新的贡献。为了有效地领导全国合理化建议和技术革新运动，苏联现已组成了一个全国合理化建议者和创造发明家协会，出版刊物，并用它来交流各地创造发明的经验。”在结束谈话的时候，格里申主席说：“苏联工会在进一步提高工会工作作用的同时，要作一切努力加强同世界各国工会的国际联系，特别是加强与社会主义国家工会的联系。苏联工会把与中国工会的兄弟般的联系看作是维护世界工会运动的统一、保卫世界和平和争取人类幸福的最重要基础。当世界劳动人民正在以自己的行动迎接光荣的“五一”节的时候，苏联工会和苏联全体劳动者愿以兄弟般的友谊向中国工会祝贺，向兄弟般的中国劳动人民祝贺。愿中国的工人阶级在他的伟大的社会主义建设中获得更光辉的成就。”
