Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th: The Shandong Provincial Party Committee recently held a provincial on-site wheat production conference in Huang County, an area of large-scale high yield, to prepare for a double leap forward in wheat planting area and unit yield next year.

The conference believed that wheat is a major item in Shandong Province's grain production. The annual wheat planting area accounts for more than 40% of the province's total cultivated land. The success or failure of wheat production will have a significant impact on improving the lives of the broad masses. Therefore, next year's wheat should see a double leap forward in planting area and unit yield. After discussion, the conference initially planned to plant 80 million mu of wheat in the province in 1959 (including 20 million mu of spring wheat and barley), with an average yield of 300 jin per mu, and eliminate wheat fields with a yield of less than 150 jin per mu.

The conference believed that most of the cultivated land in Shandong Province is suitable for planting wheat, and the water conservancy and fertilizer conditions have been greatly improved. Various regions have extensive experience in high-yield wheat production, which are all favorable conditions for achieving the plan.

In order to achieve a great leap forward in wheat production next year, the conference required all regions to start preparing everything as early as possible. At present, the first step is to start with liberating thought and unifying understanding, especially the consistency of thinking among leaders at the provincial, prefectural, and county levels. From now on, leading cadres must personally go deep into reality, go to the masses to discover and summarize experiences, hold on-site meetings, let everyone express their opinions, and put up big-character posters. Through this method, thoroughly criticize right-leaning conservative thinking. The conference also required leading cadres at all levels to change and prevent a general leadership style, work diligently, and quickly mobilize the masses to select and retain good seeds, prepare sufficient accumulated fertilizer, and improve tools. On this point, cadres at all levels must have a communist style. The conference called on everyone to think boldly and act boldly, and not be intimidated by difficulties.

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 19th: All parts of Zhejiang Province are making early preparations for a greater harvest of spring-flowering crops next year.

The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee recently requested all regions to conduct mass inspections and appraisals during the current harvesting of spring crops, summarize high-yield experiences, select and retain seeds, and discuss and formulate planting plans for spring-flowering crops next year. At present, all regions are simultaneously harvesting and holding summary experience meetings, on-site meetings, or symposiums of cadres, veteran farmers, and technicians to formulate plans for a great leap forward next year. After the Jinhua County held an on-site conference on high-yield spring crops in Chenghu Township, it criticized the erroneous argument of some cadres that "wheat and barley are low-yield crops" through visits, accounting, and debates, and successively put forward high-yield targets for next year and specific measures to achieve these targets. Leading cadres of the Dongyang County Party Committee, together with technicians and veteran farmers in Weishan Town, studied a piece of land. This wheat field achieved a yield of 570 jin per mu this year. They found that if the land utilization rate was further increased, the sowing method was improved, and field management was strengthened, the yield per mu could reach 700 to 800 jin. Based on this situation, the County Party Committee immediately held a cadre meeting and started a county-wide summary appraisal of spring-flowering crops, and proposed to increase the total output of wheat crops next year by two times compared with this year.

The seed selection work for spring-flowering crops is also widely underway in various regions. Many regions are simultaneously planning winter planting, evaluating good varieties, and exchanging good varieties to ensure that seeds are selected early, well, and sufficiently.

### 争取明年小麦双跃进  山东浙江提早布置冬播工作

　　争取明年小麦双跃进
　　山东浙江提早布置冬播工作
    据新华社济南18日电　中共山东省委最近在大面积丰产的黄县召开了全省小麦生产现场会议，为争取明年小麦种植面积和单位产量双跃进进行准备。
    会议认为，小麦是山东省粮食生产中的一个大项目，每年小麦播种面积都占全省总耕地面积的40％以上，小麦生产搞得好坏，对广大群众生活的改善会发生巨大的影响。因此，明年小麦应该在种植面积、单位产量方面来个双跃进。会议经过讨论，初步计划1959年全省种小麦八千万亩（包括春麦、大麦二千万亩），平均亩产三百斤，并消灭亩产一百五十斤以下的麦田。
    会议认为，山东省绝大部分耕地都适宜于种植小麦，水利和肥料情况已经大大改善，各地已有大面积小麦丰产经验等等，都是实现计划的良好条件。
    为实现明年小麦生产大跃进，会议要求各地及早动手做好一切准备工作。当前首先要从解放思想、统一认识入手，特别是省、地、县三级领导思想的一致。从现在开始，领导干部要亲自深入实际，到群众中去发现和总结经验，开现场会议，让大家发议论，出大字报。通过这个办法彻底地批判右倾保守思想。会议还要求各级领导干部改变和防止一般化的领导作风，踏踏实实地工作，从速发动群众进行选留良种、准备好充足的积肥和改进工具。在这点上，各级干部必须具有共产主义的风格。会议号召大家大胆的想、大胆的干，不要被困难吓倒。
    据新华社杭州19日电　浙江省各地正在为明年春花作物的更大丰收提早作好各项准备工作。
    中共浙江省委最近要求各地在当前春收作物收割过程中，进行群众性的检查评比，总结丰产经验，进行留种选种，讨论和制订明年春花作物的种植规划。现在各地正在一面收割，一面举行总结经验会议，现场会议，或干部、老农、技术员的座谈会，制订明年的大跃进规划。金华县在城湖乡举行春花作物高额丰产现场会议以后，通过参观、算账、辩论，批判了某些干部认为当地“大小麦是低产作物”的错误论点，纷纷提出明年的高产指标和达到这个指标的具体措施。中共东阳县委领导干部在巍山镇和技术员、老农一起找了一块田研究，这块小麦田今年每亩产量达到五百七十斤，他们发现如果再提高土地利用率，改进播种方法，加强田间管理，亩产量可以达到七百斤到八百斤。县委根据这一情况，立即举行了干部大会，开始了全县性的春花作物总结评比工作，并提出要把明年麦类总产量比今年增加两倍。
    春花作物的选种工作也在各地广泛展开。许多地区边规划冬种，边评选良种，边调换良种，做到种子选早、选好、选足。
