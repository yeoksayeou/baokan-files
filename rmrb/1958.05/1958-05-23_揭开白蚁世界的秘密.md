    People in the South grit their teeth at the mention of termites. Wherever there is wood, termites will descend and devour it completely. In the past, "termite extermination" businesses, motivated by profit, charged high prices for termite control but could not eradicate them completely. They would be removed this year, only to reappear the next. This was because they neither mastered the technology to eradicate termites nor wanted to, in order to continue making money. Their techniques were also strictly confidential, passed down only to sons, not daughters.

    Li Shimei, a young man from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, who only completed the first year of junior high school, mastered the life cycle of termites and found a set of methods to eradicate them through diligent practice and with the active support of the Party and the government.

      A Tour of Termite Nests

    In seven months, Li Shimei observed four to five hundred termite nests built in walls and other structures. He discovered that termite nests are divided into main nests and secondary nests. A colony of termites must have one main nest and several secondary nests. All actions of the termites in the secondary nests are subject to the command of the termite king in the main nest. Within four days, the termites in the secondary nests must return to the main nest once, rotating in shifts. The main nest has a "palace," which is the most important area in the main nest, with solid and smooth walls, and spacious. To the left of the palace is a royal chamber, smaller than the palace; to the right is a barracks, where soldier termites are stationed. Below the palace is an egg chamber, and to the left of the egg chamber is a fungus chamber, where various small fungi and insects live; to the left of the egg chamber is a plaza, where young termites play. The remaining rooms are all workshops, where worker termites are active, and the periphery of the workshops is entirely guarded by soldier termites, serving as external duty barracks.

  Inside the palace lives a termite queen, with a fat body and soft, delicate hairs. She does not work, and all food is offered by worker termites in a line. Every year from March to June, she invites the termite king into the palace to mate. About two weeks later, she begins to lay eggs, and 60% of the offspring are reproductive termites, and 40% are worker termites and soldier termites. The termite king is a male termite. Li Shimei believes there are two types of termite kings: one with a red head, black back, and white abdomen. This termite king is specifically responsible for directing the entire nest's actions and deploying troops. Li Shimei discovered that each main nest only has one such termite king. When he comes out, all soldier termites and worker termites stand still and stop working until he touches the soldier termites and worker termites with his antennae, after which the worker termites and soldier termites continue to work. The other type of termite king has a light red head and a green body and is specifically for reproduction. During the transition between spring and summer, when Li Shimei opened the termite nests, he saw this termite king cohabiting and mating with the termite queen, but when he opened the termite nests in the autumn, he could not see this termite king in the nest. Li Shimei believes that this type of termite king may die after releasing all the sperm during mating. Reproductive termites are divided into wingless and winged types. Wingless reproductive termites mate and lay eggs in the nest, but in small numbers. Winged reproductive termites fly out of the nest in pairs between spring and summer every year, soaring into the sky, and then landing, shedding their wings, and mating. Soldier termites have no reproductive ability and are also divided into two types: one with a large head and particularly developed jaws, stationed to the right of the palace, specifically protecting the palace and managing internal affairs, not performing external duty work unless there is a special mission. The other type of soldier termite is smaller in size and stationed on the outer perimeter of the nest, specializing in sentry duty, combat, searching, and protecting worker termites foraging, and other external duty work. Worker termites are specifically responsible for collecting food, building roads, building nests, repairing roads, transporting, nurturing young termites, and cultivating small fungi, etc., with no reproductive ability.

      How to Exterminate Termites

    Li Shimei conducted detailed research on how to find the main nest. He found that the walls where the main nest is located are mostly damp and dark, and the surface of the wood close to the walls has more excrement and more protruding termite paths. If one side of the nest is destroyed, the mobilization of soldier termites is particularly frequent. These are all knowledge for identifying the main nest. If you explore the location of the main nest on a section of termite path, you can destroy the termite path by hand. The termites will inevitably retreat to both sides. After a while, soldier termites will definitely come to the intersection to guard. After a while, you can see soldier termites carrying mud and water out to repair the road. The direction from which the worker termites and soldier termites come out is the direction of the main nest. By continuing to track and search in this way, you can find the main nest. Once the main nest is found, just put the poison in it, and you can kill the termites. In the past, the medicines used by termite extermination businesses could only kill adult insects and could not kill termite eggs, so they could not be cured. Li Shimei's poison can kill both adult insects and cause the eggs to rupture and die. Li Shimei once bought back termite-killing medicines from termite extermination businesses all over Guangdong Province and asked doctors to help test them, proving that the medicines used by termite extermination businesses were all arsenic trioxide plus red arsenic, thus knowing that arsenic trioxide can kill termites. Later, he saw in books that mercuric chloride, calomel, and sulfur can also kill termites. According to the results of his own experiments, he proved that all toxic minerals can kill termites, among which mercuric chloride and arsenic trioxide are the most effective. He also found that using pure mercuric chloride to kill termites has a slow killing speed, but can cause the eggs in the nest to rupture; arsenic trioxide kills termites quickly, but the termite eggs in the nest do not rupture. Thus, he mixed mercuric chloride and arsenic trioxide each at 50%, and the effect was good, the ants died, and the eggs also ruptured. Because mercuric chloride is expensive, it prompted him to adjust the dosage of the drugs. With the help of doctors, he used salicylic acid to replace arsenic trioxide. Initially, he prepared the drug in the ratio of 50% mercuric chloride, 25% arsenic trioxide, and 25% salicylic acid; however, too much salicylic acid would be humid in summer. Later, he changed it to 50% mercuric chloride, 35% arsenic trioxide, and 15% salicylic acid. This way, the cost was low, and the effect was good. Finally, he also felt that salicylic acid was easy to volatilize, so he used red arsenic to reduce the volatilization of the medicine, and it also had a color tone to indicate whether the medicine had been applied. Therefore, salicylic acid was reduced to 5%, and red arsenic was added, resulting in the current prescription, namely: 50% mercuric chloride, 35% arsenic trioxide, 10% salicylic acid, and 5% red arsenic (adding some sulfur is better when it is cold).

    When toxicologists in Beijing exchanged experiences with Li Shimei, they raised the question of whether using arsenic trioxide to poison termites is harmful to humans. They said that arsenic trioxide may grow mold, and this mold can release poisonous gas - arsine, which is very harmful to humans and can be fatal. Toxicologists believe that Li Shimei has never had any human poisoning accidents during his experiments, possibly because the holes were plugged with cotton after poisoning in the nest and salicylic acid was added to the poison to prevent mold growth. This is a problem worthy of attention and research by the scientific community.

    In addition, cutting off the termite's water absorption line can also cause the termites to die. Li Shimei found in practice that each main nest must have a water absorption line leading to an underground place with water. Even if it is a three- or five-story steel and concrete house, if there are termites, there must be one or several water absorption lines leading to the ground. He had seen a steel and concrete house in Kaiping County and other places where there were no termites on the first, second, third, and fourth floors, only a termite nest on the wooden beam on the fifth floor. He could not find the water absorption line everywhere, but he believed that termites could not survive without water. So he searched carefully again, and knocked open the wall protecting the drain pipe with a hammer, and found the water absorption line hidden next to the drain pipe. He destroyed the water absorption line by hand, and plugged the water absorption line with tung oil putty. Without applying medicine, all the termites died after seven days.

    揭开白蚁世界的秘密
    南方的人们一提起白蚂蚁，都要切齿痛恨。凡是有木头的地方，白蚁都要光降，把木头吃得体无完肤。过去，以牟利为目的的“白蚁行”替人家除治白蚁，不但要索取高价。而且不能根除，今年除掉了明年又有。这是因为他们既没有掌握根除白蚁的技术，也不想根除，好继续不断赚钱。他们的技术又是严格保密的，只传儿子不传女儿。
    广东省新会县的一个只念过初中一年级的青年李始美，通过刻苦实践的道路，在党和政府的积极支持下，掌握了白蚁的生活规律，找到了根除白蚁的一套方法。
      蚁巢巡礼
    李始美在七个月的时间中，观察了筑在墙壁等建筑中的四、五百个蚁巢。他发现蚁巢有主巢副巢之分，一群白蚁，必有一个主巢几个副巢。副巢中白蚁的一切行动都服从主巢蚁王的指挥。四天之内，副巢中的白蚁必定回主巢一次，轮回调动。主巢中有一“皇宫”，这是主巢中最重要的地区，墙壁巩固光滑，宽阔。宫的左边有王室一个，比宫小些；右边有一兵房，驻扎兵蚁。皇宫下面有一卵房，卵房左边有一菌房，生存着各种小菌和小虫；卵房的左边有广场，幼蚁都在那儿玩耍。其余的房间都是工房，是工蚁活动的地方，工房的周围全部驻扎兵蚁，是外勤兵房。
  皇宫内住着一个身体肥颀、生着软嫩细毛的白蚁皇后，她是不劳动的，一切食物都由工蚁列队奉献。每年3月到6月，她邀请蚁王进宫交尾，约两星期以后她便开始产卵，孵化出来的后代中60％是繁殖蚁，40％是工蚁和兵蚁。蚁王是雄性的白蚁。李始美认为有两种蚁王：一种是头呈红色、背呈黑色，腹部白色。这种蚁王是专门担任全巢行动的指挥任务和调兵遣将的。李始美发现每一个主巢都只有一只这样的蚁王，他一出来的时候，所有兵蚁、工蚁都肃立停工等到他用触角触动兵蚁工蚁后，工蚁兵蚁才继续进行工作。另外一种蚁王头呈淡红色，周身呈绿色，是专门生殖的。在春夏之交，李始美打开蚁巢的时候，曾看到这种蚁王和白蚁皇后同居交尾，但是在秋季打开蚁巢的时候，就看不见这种蚁王在巢里。李始美认为可能这种蚁王在交尾时排完精子以后便自行死去。繁殖蚁有无翅和有翅两种。无翅繁殖蚁在巢里交配、产卵，但数量少。有翅繁蚁殖每年春夏之间双双飞出蚁巢，高翔天空，然后落地脱翅交尾。兵蚁是没有生殖能力的，也分两种：一种头大，腮持别发达，驻在皇宫右边专门保护皇宫，管理内勤，非有特别任务，不作外勤工作。另一种兵蚁体积小些，驻扎在巢内的外围，专司警卫战斗搜索保护工蚁采食等外勤工作。工蚁专门负责搜集食物、筑路、筑巢、修路、搬运、保育幼蚁，培养小菌等任务，无生殖能力。
      怎样除治白蚁
    李始美对如何找寻主巢进行了详细的研究。他发现主巢所在的地方，墙壁大多潮湿阴暗，接近墙壁的木材表面，有较多的排泄物，伸出的蚁路多。要是破坏了巢的一边，兵蚁调动特别频繁。这些都是辨别主巢的知识。如果在一段蚁路上探索主巢所在，可以用手破坏蚁路，白蚁必然向两边撤退，过一会儿，兵蚁一定走到路口来警卫，再过一会儿，可以看到兵蚁衔着泥土和水出来修路。工蚁和兵蚁从那个方向出来，主巢就在那个方向。这样继续追踪寻觅，就可以找到主巢。找到了主巢，只要把毒药放进去，就可以杀灭白蚁。过去白蚁行所用的药只能杀死成虫，不能杀死白蚁的卵，所以无法根治。李始美的毒药，既可杀死成虫，也可以使卵破裂死亡。李始美曾经把广东全省各个白蚁行的杀蚁药买回来，请求医生帮助化验，证明白蚁行用的药料全部都是亚砒酸加红砒，因此知道了亚砒酸可以杀死白蚁。后来看到书上说升汞、甘汞、硫磺都能杀死白蚁。根据他自己试验的结果证明，凡是有毒的矿物都能杀死白蚁，其中最有效是升汞和亚砒酸，并发现纯用升汞杀白蚁，死亡速度慢，但能使巢内的卵子破裂，亚砒酸杀白蚁死亡速度快，但巢内蚁卵不破裂，这样，他将升汞和亚砒酸各50％混和，效果良好，蚁死、卵也破裂。由于升汞成本高，促使他将药物分量进行调整。在医生的帮助下，他采用水杨酸代替亚砒酸，初时按升汞50％、亚砒酸25％、水杨酸25％的比例制药；然而水杨酸过多，夏天会潮湿，后来又改为升汞50％、亚砒酸35％、水杨酸15％，这样成本低，效果好。最后还感到水杨酸容易挥发，就用红砒来减少药的挥发，而且又有色调可以表示是否进行过施药。因此，把水杨酸减少到5％，并加红砒，而成现在的处方，即：升汞50％、亚砒酸35％、水杨酸10％、红砒5％（天冷时加些硫磺更好）。
    北京的毒理学家同李始美交流经验的时候，曾提出用亚砒酸毒杀白蚁对人有无毒害的问题。他们说，亚砒酸上可能长霉，这种霉可以放出毒气——胂，它对人的危害很大，可以致死。毒理学家认为李始美实验时从未发生过人类中毒的事故，可能是在巢穴内放毒后用棉花堵塞洞口以及在毒药中放水杨酸防止生霉有关。这是值得科学界研究注意的问题。
    此外，切断白蚁的吸水线，也可以使白蚁死亡。李始美在实践中发现，每个主巢必然有吸水线通到地下有水的地方。即使是三、五层钢骨水泥盖的房子，如果有了白蚁，也必然有一条或几条吸水线通到地下。他在开平县等地方见过一座钢骨水泥盖的房子，一、二、三、四层楼都没有白蚁，只有第五层的木梁上有一个白蚁巢，遍找不见吸水线，但他认为白蚁没有水是不能生存的。于是他再细心寻找，用铁锤将保护排水管的墙敲开，就发现了吸水线藏在排水管旁边。他用手把吸水线破坏，用桐油灰泥堵塞吸水线，不施药物，结果七天后全部白蚁死亡。
