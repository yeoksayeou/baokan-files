Learning New Achievements in Romanian Science and Technology
    ——Congratulating the Opening of the Romanian Economic Exhibition
    Zhou Wenlong, Chairman of the Chinese Group of the Sino-Romanian Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, Vice Minister of Petroleum Industry

The Romanian Economic Exhibition has victoriously opened in Beijing. We express our warm congratulations!

Romania is one of the earliest countries in the world to exploit oil. As early as the mid-16th century, there were historical records of well oil extraction. In 1857, Romania established the first oil refinery. At that time, Bucharest, the capital of Romania, became the first city in the world to use kerosene to light street lamps. This year is recognized by the Romanian people as the founding year of the oil industry. Up to now, the Romanian oil industry has a history of more than one hundred years. However, the history of more than eighty years before liberation was actually a history of plunder and destruction of oil resources. Before World War II, the investment of American, British and other imperialists in the Romanian oil industry accounted for 95%. Due to the greedy plunder of imperialism, the highest crude oil production before the war reached 8.7 million tons in 1936. During World War II, Romania's oil fields and refineries were severely damaged, especially before the Soviet army was about to help liberate Romania, they were cruelly bombed by American planes. In the year of liberation – 1944, crude oil production had dropped to 3.5 million tons. Thanks to the hard work of the Romanian people under the wise leadership of the Workers' Party and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, the oil industry has been rapidly restored and developed in the past ten years since the war. In 1957, Romania's crude oil production reached more than 11 million tons, greatly exceeding the highest level before the war, and jumped to the second place among European oil-producing countries, second only to the Soviet Union. Due to the continuous discovery of new high-yielding oil areas in the past few years, and the discovery of new deep oil layers in the old oil areas, Romania's crude oil production plan for 1960 has been increased to 13.5 million tons.

After the Romanian people took control of the oil industry themselves, the creativity and enthusiasm shown in production technology are unprecedented. At present, new technologies such as turbine drilling, double-tubing wells, and dense drilling have been widely adopted. In order to improve labor productivity and reduce drilling costs, they have promoted advanced experiences and measures such as large-scale installation of drilling equipment, integral transportation of derricks, mechanization of tripping operations, and power electrification. Due to the widespread use of water injection and gas injection to maintain oilfield pressure, the recovery rate and development speed of oilfields have been greatly improved. In addition, hydraulic fracturing, thermochemical treatment, secondary oil recovery, electric heating wax removal, automatic wax removal, and enhanced oil pumping are widely used to greatly increase production. The crude oil produced by these methods accounts for 15% of the total production. Outstanding achievements have also been made in preventing crude oil loss, recovering light oil fractions, and desalting and dehydrating crude oil during storage and transportation.

In Romania, oil and natural gas have embarked on the road of comprehensive utilization. Using light oil fractions and natural gas as raw materials, it is already possible to manufacture a series of products such as fertilizers, rubber, plastics, fibers, and medicines.

The Romanian petroleum equipment manufacturing industry has also achieved rapid development during the period of socialist construction. In the past, Romania, which needed to import all petroleum equipment, even the simplest accessories, from foreign countries, can now not only be completely self-sufficient, but also export a large amount. The output of petroleum equipment reached 21.6% of the total machine output in 1957, ranking first among exported machines. In terms of technical level, the design and manufacture of petroleum equipment are also constantly improving. The drilling equipment capable of drilling 3,500 meters displayed at the Romanian Economic Exhibition is designed according to the most advanced technical principles and can be compared with the world's new equipment.

Under the sincere desire of China and Romania to help each other to achieve common economic prosperity, scientific and technological cooperation has also developed satisfactorily in recent years. In the short five years from 1953 to the present, more than 200 technical projects have been exchanged between China and Romania. The content includes: petroleum, chemical, textile, pharmaceutical, paper making, food and other industries, agriculture, and handicrafts. Especially in the petroleum and chemical industries, Romania has given us great help. For example, Romania provided our country with information on crude oil electric desalting and dehydrating equipment, and provided experience in oilfield water injection and gas injection, which enabled us to solve some important problems in the construction and development of the Yumen Oil Mine. In 1956, due to the adoption of the Romanian electrical purification method, the crude oil transported from Yumen to Shanghai was desalted and dewatered. In 1956, Romania also sent outstanding technical experts in geology, drilling, oil production, and refining to China to impart advanced experience, help solve many on-site problems, and put forward many suggestions, which have greatly promoted the development of China's oil industry. For example, in 1956, Romania sent experts in drug manufacturing, natural gas utilization, synthetic ammonia, plastics, and dyes to China to help us design more than 60 kinds of drugs for treating schistosomiasis, guide the research and trial production of anti-tuberculosis, anti-cancer, anti-influenza, and anti-malarial drugs, and guide the design of intermediate experimental workshops for the manufacture of chemical raw materials such as hydrocyanic acid, acrylonitrile, furnace black, and formaldehyde, making important contributions. In short, the technical cooperation between China and Romania is very effective. We would like to take this opportunity to express our heartfelt gratitude to Romania for its fraternal and sincere selfless assistance in science and technology, and will continue to make unremitting efforts in the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual support to make Sino-Romanian scientific and technological cooperation achieve even more fruitful results.

Just as our people are promoting a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in accordance with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results, exerting all their energy, and striving for the upper reaches, the exhibition of the Romanian Economic Exhibition provides us with an opportunity to better learn from Romania's advanced new scientific and technological achievements. Undoubtedly, this will greatly promote our socialist construction.

I wish the Romanian Economic Exhibition a great success!

May Sino-Romanian scientific and technological cooperation become increasingly close!

    学习罗马尼亚科学技术的新成就
    ——祝罗马尼亚经济展览会开幕
    中罗科学技术合作委员会中国组主席 石油工业部副部长  周文龙
    罗马尼亚经济展览会已经在北京胜利开幕。我们表示热烈的祝贺！
    罗马尼亚是世界上开采石油最早的国家之一，在十六世纪中叶，就有掘井采油的史籍记载。1857年罗马尼亚建立了第一座炼油厂，那时罗马尼亚首都布加勒斯特成了世界上第一个用煤油点亮街灯的城市。这一年也就被罗马尼亚人民认作石油工业创业的年份。到现在，罗马尼亚石油工业已经有一百多年的历史了。但在解放以前八十多年的历史实际上是石油资源遭到掠夺和破坏的历史。二次大战之前，美英等帝国主义在罗马尼亚石油工业中的投资曾占95％。由于帝国主义的贪婪掠夺，战前原油最高产量曾在1936年达到八百七十万吨。二次大战时，罗马尼亚的油田和炼厂都受到严重的破坏，尤其在苏军即将帮助解放罗马尼亚之前更遭到美机的残酷轰炸。在解放那年——1944年，原油产量已经下降到三百五十万吨。由于罗马尼亚人民在工人党的英明领导和苏联的无私援助下艰苦劳动，战后十几年来石油工业才得到飞速的恢复和发展。1957年罗马尼亚原油产量已达一千一百多万吨，大大超过战前的最高水平，一跃而居欧洲产油国家的第二位，仅次于苏联。由于几年来接连不断地找到了高产量的新油区，并在老油区发现了深部的新油层，罗马尼亚1960年的原油产量计划提高到了一千三百五十万吨。
    罗马尼亚人民自己掌握了石油工业之后，在生产技术上表现出来的创造性和积极性是空前的。目前涡轮钻井、双筒井、密集钻井等新技术已广泛采用。为了提高劳动生产率和降低钻井成本，他们推行了钻井设备大块安装、井架整体搬运、起下钻操作机械化、动力电气化等先进经验和措施。由于广泛采用了注水、注气维持油田压力的办法，大大提高了油田的采收率和开发速度。此外并广泛应用水力压裂、热化学处理、二次采油、电热清腊、自动清腊、强化抽油等方法，使产量有很大提高，采用这些方法所增产的原油达到总产量的15％。对防止原油的损耗，进行轻油分的回收以及原油的脱盐脱水等储运工作也都有突出的成绩。
    在罗马尼亚，石油和天然气已经走上了综合利用的道路。以石油轻油分和天然气为原料，已经能够制造出肥料、橡胶、塑料、纤维、药品等一系列的产品。
    罗马尼亚石油设备制造工业在社会主义建设时期内也获得飞跃的发展。过去全部石油设备，甚至连最简单的配件，也需要从外国进口的罗马尼亚，现在不但能全部自给，而且还可以大量出口。石油装备的输出量在1957年已经达到机器总输出量的21.6％，跃居出口机器中的第一位。在技术水平上，石油设备的设计和制造也在不断改进。在罗马尼亚经济展览会上陈列的能钻三千五百公尺的钻井设备就是根据最先进的技术原理设计的，可以与世界上新式的设备比美。
    中罗两国在互相帮助求得共同经济高涨的真诚愿望下，几年来科学技术合作也有令人满意的发展。从1953年到现在短短的五年里，中罗两国之间交流的技术项目已有二百多项。内容包括：石油、化学、纺织、医药、造纸、食品等工业、农业、手工业各个方面。特别在石油、化学工业方面，罗马尼亚给了我们很大的帮助。例如由于罗马尼亚供给我国原油电力脱盐脱水设备资料，提供油田注水、注气等经验，使我们解决了玉门油矿建设和开发方面的一些重要问题。1956年由于采用了罗马尼亚电力净化方法，使从玉门运到上海的原油脱除了盐水。1956年罗马尼亚还曾派遣了地质、钻井、采油、炼油的优秀技术专家来我国传授了先进经验，帮助解决了不少现场问题，提出了许多建议，对于我国石油工业的发展有重要的促进作用。再如1956年罗马尼亚派遣了药物制造、天然气利用、合成氨、塑料、染料等专家来我国，帮助我们设计了六十多种治疗血吸虫病的药品，指导了抗结核、抗癌、防治流行性感冒、抗疟药物的研究和试制工作，指导了制造氰氢酸、丙稀氰、炉法炭黑、甲醛等化工原料的中间试验车间的设计等等，作出了重要的贡献。总之，中罗两国的技术合作是卓有成效的。我们借此机会对罗马尼亚给予我国科学技术方面兄弟般的真诚无私的援助表示衷心的感谢，并将本着互相帮助互相支援的精神，继续不懈地努力，使中罗科学技术合作获得更加丰硕的成果。
    正当我国人民按着多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的方针推动工农业生产大跃进的时侯，罗马尼亚经济展览会的展出，使我们有机会更好地学习罗马尼亚先进的科学技术新成就。无疑的，这对我国社会主义建设事业将有很大的促进作用。
    祝罗马尼亚经济展览会获得巨大的成功！
    愿中罗科学技术合作日益亲密！
