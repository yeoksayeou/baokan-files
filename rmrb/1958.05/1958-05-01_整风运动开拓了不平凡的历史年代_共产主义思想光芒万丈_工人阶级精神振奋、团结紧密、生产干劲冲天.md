Xinhua News Agency, 30th - Xinhua News Agency reporter Xu Zhongni, in a comprehensive report on the nationwide anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement in industrial enterprises, said: The spiritual outlook of people and the relationships between people in China's industrial enterprises are undergoing profound changes. The anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, which has been universally launched on the basis of the rectification movement, has powerfully promoted this change. The most characteristic fact at present is the soaring of the communist spirit of the working masses, and the gradual formation of a new leadership style in which enterprise cadres go deep into the masses, deep into production, and strive to be both red and expert.

The rectification movement and the anti-waste, anti-conservatism movement, which is in the midst of a major transformation and great change, are of great and far-reaching significance for thoroughly transforming the leadership style of China's industrial enterprises, further developing the socialist relationship between cadres and workers, and eliminating the remnants of the "relationship of domination and subordination" in enterprise management left over from the old society. At present, various localities are creating or trying out a new set of leadership methods that go deep into the masses, deep into production, and achieve both red and expert. There are several main forms: 1. Cadres and workers eat together (eat in the same cafeteria), live together (move into workers' residences or collective dormitories), and work together (participate in half a day to several half days on a regular basis), which has begun to be implemented in various localities. In Fuxin City, Liaoning Province, it has become a common practice for enterprise leaders to implement the "three togethers." In Shenyang City, 678 enterprise leaders (accounting for 73.6% of the total) have moved into workers' residences. 2. Cultivating experimental plots. Some organize experimental groups, experimental sections, or workshops according to production units; some organize "one-dragon" or "two-dragon" operations according to production lines; some organize comprehensive experimental plots according to the nature of the problem (creating comprehensive experience in leading production), or special experimental plots (experimenting with a new technology or labor organization); and some implement follow-the-shift labor. The common point of these practices is that leading cadres participate in labor and directly lead production. At present, most provinces and cities are trying it out. Liaoning Province has established nearly 3,000 experimental plots in more than 1,000 enterprises, and Tianjin City has 506 factories and more than 1,800 cadres implementing follow-the-shift labor. 3. Party, government, labor union, and Youth League cadres in enterprises follow-the-shift work. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine divides all management personnel into two shifts for office work. The Shanghai No. 2 State Cotton Factory also reorganizes the Party, Youth League, and labor union organizations according to the characteristics of the three-shift system production in departments that directly serve production and workers. 4. On-site office work (workshops, underground pits, and construction sites). 5. Holding on-site meetings, organizing exhibitions, visits, and competitions to quickly promote the experience of advanced units. The above-mentioned various methods of transforming leadership style being tried out by enterprises in various localities have achieved good results. This not only enables enterprise leaders to gradually become familiar with and master production, and to discover and solve problems in a timely manner, but more importantly, it enables leaders to put down their airs and mingle with workers, share weal and woe with the masses, and truly establish equal comradely relations with workers in the identity of laborers, thereby greatly arousing the political enthusiasm and production drive of workers.

The unprecedentedly high labor enthusiasm shown by the broad masses of workers and the new atmosphere that has emerged in handling the relationship between individuals and the state during this period demonstrate the great surge in the spirit of being masters of the country and the spirit of communism in the movement of self-education. The drive in the Great Leap Forward in production is unprecedented. Workers automatically arrive early, leave late, and even work overtime. They actively learn and improve technology, and take the initiative to revise quotas and planned targets. Construction workers of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company proposed "working hard in light rain, working even harder in light rain, and doing one and a half days' work on a sunny day." The employees of Harbin Songjiang Hardware Factory overturned the planned targets proposed by the leadership for nine consecutive times, raising this year's output value plan to more than 130% of the actual level in 1957. Many enterprises' workers voluntarily returned "small warehouses" and public property occupied by individuals. Workers of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company alone returned more than 17,000 pieces of public property. The past situation in which workers had excessive demands for wages and welfare has fundamentally changed. They automatically demanded the cancellation of unreasonable welfare benefits. Some enterprise workers returned labor protection or welfare items such as work clothes and gloves issued by the enterprise that exceeded actual needs, and criticized the leadership's waste. A new atmosphere of comparing drive, diligence, thrift, technology, culture, and unity among the working masses is being greatly promoted. Amidst the surge in the communist spirit of the working masses, enterprise leaders in various localities are combining major rectification and major changes to guide the situation and begin to more widely organize workers to debate the issue of "working for whom" and the concept of collaboration, seeking to more thoroughly resolve the relationship between individuals and the state, and individuals and the collective from a fundamental ideological perspective. At the same time, attention is paid to both cherishing the workers' selfless labor enthusiasm and controlling overtime work and excessive intensification of labor, paying attention to guiding the workers' enthusiasm towards improving and innovating technology, and paying attention to carefully handling the wage and welfare issues raised in the movement.

During this period, the broad masses of engineering and technical personnel in industrial enterprises, especially design personnel, rescued many major losses that were about to be caused by reviewing and revising designs. Many people have begun to experience the slogans of putting politics in command and being both red and expert, and have formulated personal struggle plans. Many senior engineers have begun to go deep into the workshops and jointly study and solve technical problems with workers. However, on the whole, technical personnel in the movement still lag behind the working masses. At present, enterprise leaders in various localities are combining major rectification and major changes to further strengthen the ideological transformation of technical personnel, so as to promote them to fully play their role in the Great Leap Forward in production and the upcoming technological revolution.

The general trend of the current movement is to liberate the mind. The broad masses of workers and staff have shaken off the ideological constraints of dogmatism and empiricism, boldly thinking about problems, carrying forward the spirit of originality, breaking through work methods and rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces, establishing work methods and rules and regulations that can promote the Great Leap Forward in production, and on this basis, pushing production to a new climax.

    整风运动开拓了不平凡的历史年代
    共产主义思想光芒万丈
    工人阶级精神振奋、团结紧密、生产干劲冲天
    据新华社30日讯　新华社记者徐中尼综述全国工业企业双反运动情况说：我国工业企业中人的精神面貌和人与人的关系，正在发生深刻的变化。在整风运动的基础上普遍展开的反浪费、反保守运动，有力地促进了这种变化。当前最有特征的事实，是工人群众共产主义精神的高涨，企业干部深入群众、深入生产、力求又红又专的领导新风气的逐渐形成。
    整风和正处在大整大改高潮中的双反运动，对于彻底转变我国工业企业的领导作风，进一步发展干部和工人之间的社会主义关系，肃清旧社会遗留下来的企业管理中“统治与服从关系”的残余，具有重大的、影响深远的意义。目前各地正在创造或试行一套新的深入群众、深入生产和达到又红又专的领导方法。主要有几种形式：一、干部和工人同吃（在一个食堂吃饭）、同住（搬进工人住宅或集体宿舍去住）、同劳动（每周定期参加一个半天到几个半天不等），各地都已开始实行。辽宁省阜新市企业领导干部实行“三同”已成为普遍的风气，沈阳市已经有六百七十八名企业领导干部（占总数73.6％）搬进工人住宅。二、种试验田。有的按生产单位搞试验小组、试验工段或车间，有的按生产作业线搞“一条龙”或“两条龙”，有的按问题性质搞综合性试验田（创造领导生产的全面经验），或专题性试验田（试验一种新技术或劳动组织），有的实行跟班劳动。这几种作法的共同点，是领导干部参加劳动并直接领导生产。目前多数省市都在试行，辽宁省已有一千多个企业建立了近三千个试验田，天津市已有五百零六个厂、一千八百多个干部实行了跟班劳动。三、企业党、政、工、团干部跟班工作，焦作煤矿将全部管理人员分成两班办公，上海国棉二厂直接为生产和工人服务的科室也按三班制生产的特点，分班办公，并且按三班生产的特点改组了党、团和工会的组织。四、现场办公（车间、坑下和工地）。五、开现场会议，组织展览、参观、评比，迅速推广先进单位的经验。各地企业试行的上述种种转变领导作风的作法，已经收到了良好的效果，这不仅使企业领导干部逐步熟悉和掌握生产、及时发现和解决问题，更为重要的是能使领导干部放下架子，和工人打成一片，与群众同甘共苦，真正以劳动者的身份和工人建立平等的同志的关系，因而在更大的程度上鼓起了工人的政治热情和生产干劲。
    广大职工群众在这一时期表现出的空前高涨的劳动热情和在处理个人与国家关系中出现的新风气，显示了在自我教育的运动中作为国家主人翁的思想和共产主义的精神大大高涨。生产大跃进中的干劲是前所未有的，自动地早到、晚退甚至加班加点，积极学习和改进技术，主动要求修改定额和计划指标。武汉钢铁公司的建筑工人提出“大雨小干、小雨大干、晴天当一天半”。哈尔滨松江五金厂职工连续九次推翻领导上提出的计划指标，把今年的产值计划提高到1957年实际水平的130％以上。许多企业的工人自动送还“小仓库”和个人占用的公物，仅重庆钢铁公司的工人就交回公物达一万七千多件。工人中过去曾经有过的对工资、福利要求过高的情况，已经根本改变，自动要求取消不合理的福利待遇，有的企业工人退还了企业发给的超过实际需要的工作服、手套等劳动保护或福利物品，批评领导的浪费。工人群众中比干劲、比勤俭、比技术、比文化、比团结的新风气，正在大大发扬。在工人群众共产主义精神的高涨中，各地企业的领导正在结合大整大改进行因势利导，着手更广泛地组织工人辩论“为谁劳动”和协作思想问题，求得更彻底地从根本思想上解决个人与国家、个人与集体的关系。同时注意一方面爱护工人忘我的劳动热情，一方面控制加班加点和过分加强劳动强度的情况，注意把工人的热情引导到提高和革新技术的方面去，注意慎重地处理运动中提出的工资福利问题。
    工业企业中的广大工程技术人员，特别是设计人员，这一时期通过审查和修改设计，抢救了许多将要造成的重大损失。有许多人对政治挂帅、又红又专的口号，开始有了体验，纷纷制订个人奋斗计划，不少高级工程师开始深入车间，和工人共同研究解决技术问题。但是整个说来，技术人员在运动中还存在着跟不上工人群众的情况。目前各地企业的领导正在结合大整大改，进一步加强技术人员的思想改造，促使他们在生产大跃进和即将到来的技术革命中充分发挥作用。
    当前运动发展的总趋向，是解放思想。广大职工都纷纷摆脱教条主义、经验主义的思想束缚，大胆的思考问题，发扬独创精神，冲破束缚生产力的工作方法和规章制度，树立能够促进生产大跃进的工作方法和规章制度，并在此基础上把生产推向新的高潮。
