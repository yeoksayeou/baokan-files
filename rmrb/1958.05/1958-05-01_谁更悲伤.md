　　President Nasser of the United Arab Republic was invited by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union to visit the Soviet Union. It is common for two friendly countries to visit each other to enhance mutual understanding. Unexpectedly, this caused panic among some American newspapers. The "Washington Post" is like this, on the one hand, it wants the US government to take a "policy that neither strengthens Nasser's position nor gives him reason to claim persecution"; on the other hand, it provokes the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic, saying that Nasser's "greatest threat" lies in his friendship with the Soviet Union. Another American newspaper, the "New York Daily News," put on an even more "compassionate" face, saying: "We have a feeling that when this trip is over, Nasser will become a more sad...character."

　　Of course, the outcry of the reactionary American newspapers is not without reason. The struggle of the Arab people for independence and the Soviet Union's support for them does pose the "greatest threat" to American imperialism, and therefore it is very clear that the one who is "more sad" is none other than the planners and executors of the "Eisenhower Doctrine."

    谁更悲伤
    阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔应苏联最高苏维埃主席团的邀请到苏联去访问，两个友好国家为了增进互相了解，互相访问，本是常事。不料这却引起美国一些报刊的惶恐。“华盛顿邮报”就是这样，它一方面要美国政府采取一项“既不加强纳赛尔的地位又不使他有理由声称受到迫害的政策”；一方面挑拨苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的关系，说什么纳赛尔的“最大的威胁”在于他同苏联友好。美国另一家报纸“纽约每日新闻”更装出“悲天悯人”的面孔，说什么：“我们有一种预感，当这次旅行结束时，纳赛尔将变成一个更悲伤……的人物”。
    当然，美国反动报纸的这种叫嚷不是没有原因的。阿拉伯人民争取独立的斗争和苏联对他们的声援，的确使美帝国主义受到“最大的威胁”，因而很明显“更悲伤”的不是别人而恰恰是“艾森豪威尔主义”的策划者和执行者。
