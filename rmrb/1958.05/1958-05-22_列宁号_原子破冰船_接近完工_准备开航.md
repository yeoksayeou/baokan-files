Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st. The world's first atomic icebreaker, the "Lenin," will soon begin its voyage in the near future. Tense preparations are currently underway on board.

　　This atomic icebreaker is increasingly taking on a finished appearance. The ship's 44,000-horsepower atomic engine only needs to consume a few grams of fuel per day. It has a sailing speed of eighteen knots per hour in water and can conquer ice layers two meters thick.

　　During the construction process, the latest equipment was transported from forty-eight National Economic Committees across the country. Currently, many scientists and engineers are working together on the ship for the peaceful use of atomic energy.

    新华社莫斯科21日电　世界上第一艘原子破冰船“列宁号”即将在短期内开始航行。现在船上正进行开航前的紧张工作。
    这艘原子破冰船日益具有完工的外貌。船上四万四千马力的原子发动机，每天只需要消耗几克的燃料。在水中每小时航行速度为十八浬，能征服两公尺厚的冰层。
    在建造过程中，全国有四十八个国民经济委员会运来最新式的设备。目前许多科学家和工程师们一起在船上为和平利用原子能而劳动。
