Guangxi Nandan County Changes Co-habitation of Humans and Livestock

A revolutionary measure to change the co-habitation of humans and livestock and to transform customs - the "three collectives" of cattle pens, pigsties, and toilets - is being actively promoted in Nandan County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. Party and government leaders in the county personally took charge, mobilizing the masses to carry out short-term crash programs during the busy farming season. Eleven of the county's eighty-one townships have now realized the "three collectives" of cattle pens, pigsties, and toilets.

The separation of humans and livestock and the "three collectives" of toilets, cattle pens, and pigsties were decided upon by the Nandan County Committee of the Communist Party of China at the end of March this year. The specific method is to select appropriate locations near villages to build collective cattle pens and collective toilets for common use; collective pigsties are divided into several small rooms, and pigs are raised separately according to public and private ownership. This measure has many advantages: it not only improves environmental sanitation and living conditions, ensuring the prosperity of both humans and livestock, but more importantly, this system fundamentally solves the contradiction between the public use of fertilizer and private ownership of fertilizer in agricultural cooperatives, and also creates favorable conditions for promoting the use of cattle manure to feed pigs and generate biogas.

In the past, the Zhuang, Yao, and other ethnic groups in Nandan County generally lived with their livestock - people lived upstairs, and the cattle pen or pigsty was downstairs; the open-air toilets scattered in each household were mostly surrounded by rice straw. Therefore, flies and mosquitoes swarmed, and environmental sanitation was very poor. On the other hand, when agricultural cooperatives collected farm manure, conflicts over public and private fertilizer commonly occurred, affecting collective production.

### 广西南丹县改变人畜同居

    广西南丹县改变人畜同居
    一个改变人畜同居、移风易俗的革命措施——牛栏、猪圈、厕所“三集体”，正在广西僮族自治区南丹县积极推行。这个县的党政领导干部亲自挂帅，发动群众在农忙中进行短期突击；全县八十一个乡现在已有十一个乡实现了牛栏、猪圈、厕所“三集体”。
    人畜分居，厕所、牛栏、猪圈“三集体”是中共南丹县委在今年3月底研究决定推行的。具体作法是：在村庄附近选择适当位置，建立集体牛栏和集体厕所，共同使用；集体猪圈则分成若干小间，按公有、私有分别喂养。这一措施的好处很多，不但改善环境卫生和居住条件，使人畜两旺，更重要的是，这个制度从根本上解决了农业社公用肥料和肥料私有的矛盾，还给推广牛粪喂猪和沼气发电创造了有利条件。
    过去，南丹县的僮、瑶等族人民普遍是人畜共居——楼上住人，楼下便是牛栏或猪圈；分散在各家各户的露天厕所也多是用稻草围起来。因此，苍蝇蚊子成群，环境卫生很差。另一方面，农业社在收集农家肥料时，普遍发生公私争肥的矛盾，影响了集体生产。
