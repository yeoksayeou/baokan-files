　　Spurring the Horse On

The Great Leap Forward in production demands a Great Leap Forward in schistosomiasis prevention and treatment. In the past, hospitals were large and remained in the cities, adopting long-term treatments, and farmers had to spend dozens of yuan to be hospitalized for treatment. As a result, hospitals were deserted and treatment was slow. Recently, the vast number of medical workers have broken free from the shackles of old ideas, are full of energy, implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results, go deep into the countryside, conduct mobile stationing in the communes, deliver medicine to the door, and boldly adopt the three-day treatment method. The treatment time is short, the cost is low, and the speed of eliminating schistosomiasis is greatly accelerated. Cadres and farmers applauded and welcomed this. This spring, 350,000 patients have been treated nationwide; in Jiaxing area, Zhejiang, 70,000 patients were treated in two years, but 105,000 patients were treated in April alone; in Renjiaban Village, Shaoxing, only 58 patients were treated in the past two years, but 400 patients were treated in two months this year. In some areas with the same or better conditions as Renjiaban Village, it is entirely possible to accelerate the treatment of schistosomiasis patients.

In the context of the nationwide boiling Great Leap Forward, accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis is not only the urgent demand of the vast number of farmers, but also the requirement of the country's socialist construction. As everyone knows, people are the main part of the productive forces. Now there are 10 million schistosomiasis patients in the country. If we accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis nationwide, this production army liberated from the hands of the disease demon will accelerate the country's socialist construction. This year's national combat goal is to basically eliminate schistosomiasis in 134 epidemic counties and cities. The current achievements are still far from meeting this requirement. We hope that medical workers in various places will dare to think and dare to act, break with conventions, spur the horse on, not just walk at the horse's pace, and even more not dismount and walk slowly; areas that have basically eliminated snails and schistosomiasis cannot be complacent, but should work harder and repeatedly sweep to completely eliminate schistosomiasis.

　　快马加鞭
    生产大跃进，要求血吸虫病防治工作也来一个大跃进。过去，医院架子大，蹬在城镇，采用长期疗程，农民住院治病要花费几十元，因此，医院门前冷落，治疗速度缓慢。最近，广大医务工作者冲出旧思想的樊笼，干劲冲天，贯彻多快好省的方针，深入农村，巡回驻社，送药上门，大胆采用三日疗法，治病时间短，花费少，大大加快了消灭血吸虫病的速度，干部、农民鼓掌欢迎。今年春天全国已经治疗了三十五万病人；浙江嘉兴地区两年治疗七万病人，今年4月一个月却治疗了十万五千病人；绍兴任家坂村，过去两年仅治疗五十八个病人，今年两个月就治疗了四百个病人。在一些和任家坂村条件相同或者条件较好的地区，加速治疗血吸虫病患者是完全可以做到的。
    在举国沸腾的全面大跃进形势下，加速消灭血吸虫病，不仅是广大农民的迫切要求，也是祖国社会主义建设的要求。大家知道，人是生产力的主要部分，现在全国有一千万血吸虫病人，如果加速消灭全国的血吸虫病，这一支从病魔手里解放出来的生产大军，将加速祖国的社会主义建设。今年全国的战斗目标是要在一百三十四个流行县、市基本消灭血吸虫病，目前的成绩与这个要求相比，距离还遥远。我们希望各地医务工作者敢想敢干，打破常规，要快马加鞭，不要随马信步，更不要下马慢行；已经基本消灭钉螺和血吸虫病的地区，也不能自满，要加一把劲，反复扫荡，以便彻底消灭血吸虫病。
