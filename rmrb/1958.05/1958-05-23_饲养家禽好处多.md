    Raising Poultry Has Many Benefits
    There are many benefits to raising chickens. Take Guanzhuang Village in Guanzhuang Commune, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, for example. The village has about forty households and raises nearly a hundred chickens and ducks. The whole village produces an average of more than fifty eggs every day. Not only do families often have delicious dishes such as stewed eggs and scrambled eggs, but almost all of their expenses, such as oil and salt, men's cigarettes, and women's shoe fabrics, are covered by the eggs. Bachelor Cao Yong'an relies entirely on the eggs laid by his two hens and one duck to cover his expenses for cigarettes, oil, and salt. The cooperative store near this village can collect and exchange dozens of catties or even a擔 [dan - traditional unit of weight] or more of eggs every day. As for chicken and duck meat, it is an even more nutritious dish. Chicken and duck feathers are also very useful. Therefore, raising chickens and ducks is worth promoting greatly.

    饲养家禽好处多
    养鸡的好处是很多的。拿江苏江都县官庄社的一个官庄村来说，村上四十来户就养了近百只鸡鸭，全村每天平均产蛋五十个以上。这不仅家家常有炖蛋、炒蛋等好小菜吃；而且一家的油盐费用、男人的香烟、女人的鞋面布等，几乎没有一样不是靠蛋上出息的。单身汉曹永安，他的香烟、油盐的用费全靠二只母鸡、一只母鸭生蛋来解决的。这村子附近的合作商店，每天能收购和调换到几十斤甚至一担以上的蛋。至于鸡鸭肉，更是富有营养的一种菜肴。鸡鸭毛也大有用处。因此，饲养鸡鸭是值得大大提倡的。　　　　　　新曲
