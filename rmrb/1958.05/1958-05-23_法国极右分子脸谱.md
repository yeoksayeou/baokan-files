Faces of French Right-Wingers

    Bidault

    The fifty-nine-year-old Bidault is the leader of the right wing of the French Popular Republican Movement and an old associate of de Gaulle. On the 14th, he and Soustelle and others publicly issued a statement clamoring for the establishment of a so-called "government of national salvation." He demanded that de Gaulle come to power and establish a dictatorial rule, howling that this was France's "last hope."

    Bidault was a follower of the Vatican in his early years. During the Second World War, under the orders of the Holy See, he infiltrated the French Resistance movement, using "resistance to the enemy" as a pretext to promote de Gaulle, thereby further gaining the favor of reactionary forces at home and abroad.

    After the liberation of France, with the support of American monopoly capital and French reactionary forces, Bidault quickly became a rising star in political circles. He served as Prime Minister twice and as Foreign Minister eight times. The Popular Republicans, headed by him, controlled the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs for ten years, and he insisted on implementing a policy of following the United States and selling out the national interests of his own country. The French media called Bidault the "French Affairs Minister of the United States."

    Bidault is a veteran colonialist. When he was Prime Minister, he insisted on carrying out a colonial war in Indochina. On the North African issue, he has always advocated pursuing a "tough" colonial policy, attempting to make Algeria a French colony forever.

    Bidault and the Popular Republican Movement represent the interests of French monopoly capital—the Banque de l'Indochine group.

    Soustelle

    Jacques Soustelle is de Gaulle's right-hand man and is now the leader of the Social Republican Party (formerly the Gaullist Party). After the outbreak of the Algerian riots, he suddenly flew to Algiers on the 17th to direct the riot operations. Reuters reporters in Algiers reported that people pointed out that Soustelle was the person who created the current crisis.

    Soustelle is forty-six years old. In 1940, he fled to London and began to rely on de Gaulle, responsible for de Gaulle's overall intelligence work.

    After the war, Soustelle returned to Paris with de Gaulle. From 1945 to early 1946, he successively served as Minister of Information and Minister of Colonies in de Gaulle's government.

    In 1947, de Gaulle formed the fascist party Rally of the French People, and Soustelle served as its Secretary-General. The current Social Republican Party was formed after this alliance split internally and suffered a disastrous defeat in the elections.

    In 1955, Soustelle was appointed Governor-General of Algeria. After taking office, he intensified the suppression, openly clamoring to use "all forces and all means to combat" the Algerian people's national liberation movement. He closed newspapers, established concentration camps, and ordered the dissolution of the Algerian Communist Party. However, due to the strong struggle of the Algerian people, his colonial policy completely failed, and in January 1956, he was dismissed by the French government.

    法国极右分子脸谱
    皮杜尔
    现年五十九岁的皮杜尔是法国人民共和党极右翼的领袖，是戴高乐的老搭当。他在14日和苏斯戴尔等公开发表声明，叫嚣要成立所谓“救国政府”。他要求戴高乐上台，建立独裁统治，嚎叫说这是法国的“最后的希望”。
    皮杜尔早年是梵蒂冈的一个门客。第二次世界大战中，他秉承教廷之命钻入法国抵抗运动，以“抗敌”为名，为戴高乐作宣传，从而进一步取得了国内外反动势力的宠爱。
    法国解放以后，皮杜尔在美国垄断资本和法国反动势力的支持下，一跃而为政界的红人。他两次担任总理、八次担任外交部长。以他为首的人民共和党人把持了法国外交部有十年，他坚持执行追随美国、出卖本国民族利益的政策。法国舆论把皮杜尔称之为“美国的法兰西事务部长”。
    皮杜尔是一个老牌的殖民主义者。他任总理时，曾坚持在印度支那进行殖民战争。在北非问题上，他也一向主张奉行“强硬”的殖民政策，企图使阿尔及利亚永远成为法国的殖民地。
    皮杜尔和人民共和党代表着法国的垄断资本——东方汇理银行集团的利益。
      苏斯戴尔
    雅克·苏斯戴尔是戴高乐的左右手，他现在是社会共和党（前戴高乐党）的领袖。阿尔及利亚暴乱发生后，他突然在17日飞到阿尔及尔，来指挥暴乱行动。在阿尔及尔的路透社记者报道说，人们指出苏斯戴尔就是制造目前危机的人。
    苏斯戴尔现年四十六岁，他在1940年逃到伦敦，开始投靠戴高乐，负责戴高乐的全盘特务工作。
    战后，苏斯戴尔随同戴高乐回到巴黎。1945年到1946年初，他在戴高乐的政府中先后担任情报部长和殖民部长。
    1947年，戴高乐组成法西斯政党法兰西人民联盟，苏斯戴尔担任总书记。现在的社会共和党就是这个联盟内部发生分裂和在选举中遭到惨败以后，改组而成的。
    1955年，苏斯戴尔受任为阿尔及利亚总督，他到任后就加紧镇压行动，公开叫嚣要用“一切力量和一切手段来打击”阿尔及利亚人民的民族解放运动。他封闭报馆，设立集中营，并且下令解散阿尔及利亚共产党。但是由于阿尔及利亚人民的坚强斗争，他的殖民政策全盘失败，1956年1月，他被法国政府撤职。
