Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 23rd - More than 650 million tons of coal reserves have been proven in the Baipu (Baishui-Pucheng) area of ​​Northern Wei River. The Northwest Coalfield Geological Exploration Bureau has delineated well fields here that can be used to build two pairs of mines with an annual output of 900,000 tons, and handed them over to Shaanxi Province to develop the local coal industry.

The data obtained from the exploration prove that this area is not only large in area but also rich in reserves. The average thickness of each coal seam is three to four meters, and the thickest part reaches more than seven meters. The coal produced can be used for industrial power and coking. The railway from Xi'an to Baotou passes through the middle of the well field, making transportation convenient.

The Wei River Coalfield, centered on Tongchuan, stretches for more than 300 kilometers on its east and west wings.

    渭北白蒲地区
    找到六亿多吨煤
    据新华社西安23日电　渭北白（水）蒲（城）地区已经探明有六亿五千多万吨煤炭储量。西北煤田地质勘探局已在这里划出可供建设两对年产九十万吨的矿井用的井田，交由陕西省发展地方煤炭工业。
    勘探所得的资料证明，这个地区不仅面积大，而且藏量丰富，每层煤平均厚度在三到四公尺，最厚处达到七公尺多。所产的煤可以用来作工业动力和炼焦。从西安到包头的铁路从这里的井田中部通过，交通方便。
    渭北煤田以铜川为中心，东西两翼共延绵三百多公里。
