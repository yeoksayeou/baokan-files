At the commemorative meeting held at the Beijing Gymnasium, more than 7,000 young people listened to a report by Colonel Zhao Wenchang, a veteran of the Long March and a representative of the People's Liberation Army. For more than 20 years, Colonel Zhao Wenchang has maintained the Red Army soldier's spirit of hard work and simplicity, and his noble character of loyalty to the revolutionary cause. His report deeply moved the young people present. When representatives of the returning Volunteer Army gave reports to students of major universities and middle schools in the capital, they spoke of the moving scenes of the deep farewell given to the Volunteer Army by the Korean people and army during their withdrawal from Korea, which deeply moved all those present.

At the meeting, the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League commended 80 members of the Communist Youth League and decided to include their advanced deeds in the honor book of the Municipal Committee of the League. In the evening, the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, the Shanghai Youth Palace and other units held a "Lu Xun Medal Reading Campaign" activity day at the Youth Palace. Many factory youths took "May Fourth" as a Youth Technical Innovation Day, launching activities such as reviewing technical innovation achievements, commending advanced individuals, and exchanging experiences.

　　Youth in Guangzhou held a commemorative meeting and an evening of literary and artistic review on the 3rd and 4th, respectively. More than 500 members of the Communist Youth League and youth in the Zhujiang District also went to Donghu on the 4th to participate in voluntary labor.

　　Youth in Fuzhou held sports activities such as crossing the Minjiang River on the 4th. In the afternoon, more than 400 young water athletes braved the drizzle and, amid cheers from thousands of spectators on both sides of the river, jumped into the water batch by batch with great spirit, and quickly crossed the more than 600-meter-wide Minjiang River surface under the escort of dozens of small sampans.
