    Extremely Power-Saving Electric Clock
    The Shanghai Joint State-Private Beigao Clock Factory has recently successfully trial-produced an electric clock that consumes extremely little power. Fitted with a regular flashlight battery, it can run for as long as four hundred days. It eliminates the trouble of winding the spring and is not restricted by power sources, making it suitable for use in both urban and rural areas. (He Yuanming)
