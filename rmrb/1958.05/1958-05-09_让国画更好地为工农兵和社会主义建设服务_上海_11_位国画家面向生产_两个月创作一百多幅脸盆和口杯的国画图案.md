Let Traditional Chinese Painting Better Serve Workers, Peasants, Soldiers, and Socialist Construction
    Shanghai 11 Traditional Chinese Painters Face Production
  　Creating Over 100 Traditional Chinese Painting Patterns for Washbasins and Mugs in Two Months
    (Our reporter Zhang Feng reports) Eleven Shanghai traditional Chinese painters are participating in labor and conducting art design for enamelware in two enamel factories. They are attempting to combine traditional Chinese painting with applied arts, so that the ancient traditional Chinese painting art can serve workers, peasants, soldiers, and socialist construction more widely and effectively. In the past two months, they have created more than 100 traditional Chinese painting patterns for washbasins and mugs, and more than 60 of them have been made into finished products, including flowers, insects and birds, and figures. The trial sales show that consumers generally believe that the enamelware has a new look in terms of color and pattern, and the trial sales products are quickly sold out.
    The combination of traditional Chinese painting and applied arts is an initiative recently proposed to the national traditional Chinese painting community by the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Academy of Chinese Painting. They proposed that the combination of traditional Chinese painting and the broad road of applied arts can solve the problem of traditional Chinese painting facing production and practical application, and can better serve workers, peasants, soldiers, and socialist construction. As a result, the quality of applied art products can be improved by using national painting styles, and traditional Chinese painters can carry out ideological transformation in the process of labor, creating an ideological basis for traditional Chinese painting to serve socialist construction. Wang Geyi, Jiang Hanting, Cheng Shifa, Shao Luoyang, Tang Yun, Li Qiujun, Zhou Lianxia and other eleven painters went to two enamel factories to accumulate experience for the combination of traditional Chinese painting and applied arts.
    From the two months of practice in the factory, the eleven traditional Chinese painters unanimously believe that the combination of traditional Chinese painting and applied arts is a correct path. They believe that when traditional Chinese painting was produced, it was combined with practicality; in the long-term development process, there was also an aspect of combining with applied arts. For example, ancient painted pottery and Song Dynasty fan paintings are still considered to have high artistic value. It was only in the long feudal society that traditional Chinese painting was seized by the scholar-official class and became an exclusive appreciation product for a few people, seriously divorced from reality, divorced from the masses of the people, and despised the practical path of combining traditional Chinese painting with applied arts. Traditional Chinese painters must also critically inherit the tradition of traditional Chinese painting. Especially in today's situation, all aspects are making great leaps forward, and the traditional Chinese painting community must also make great leaps forward, mobilizing all positive factors of traditional Chinese painting to serve socialism. In this way, if traditional Chinese painting is still limited to exhibitions and general appreciation, it will not be able to meet the needs of the masses of the people, nor can it meet the urgent desire of traditional Chinese painters to better serve construction. Making paintings into handicrafts and spreading them can penetrate into every family; this can play a great role in beautifying people's lives and meeting the people's growing cultural needs.
    The advocacy of the combination of traditional Chinese painting and applied arts in Shanghai's traditional Chinese painting community does not exclude traditional Chinese painting creation. On the contrary, through the combination of applied arts, painters participate in physical labor, overcome the shortcomings of being divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, self-proclaimed nobility, and narrow living circles, and the quality of traditional Chinese painting creation will also be improved. In the past two months, the eleven painters have eaten, lived, and worked with the workers in the factory, and generally believe that there has been great progress in ideology, and the emotional distance with the working people has been greatly shortened. In addition to designing for enamelware, they have also created dozens of traditional Chinese paintings, the quantity and quality of which have improved compared with the past.
    In the process of making art designs for enamelware, the traditional Chinese painters first learn from the workers in labor, master the characteristics of enamel production, and make their creations suitable for production. Cheng Shifa, Tang Yun and others participated in the labor of the spraying workshop, learned spraying techniques, and studied with the workers how to spray traditional Chinese painting patterns well. The eleven traditional Chinese painters also opened a traditional Chinese painting tutoring class, absorbing workers in the enamel industry who love art to learn traditional Chinese painting. In this way, new traditional Chinese painting workers of the working class are cultivated, and enamel workers can grasp the characteristics of traditional Chinese painting, improve chiseling and spraying techniques, and truly convey the artistic style of traditional Chinese painting and even the unique style of each painter on enamel products. This initiative of the Shanghai traditional Chinese painting community has been greatly welcomed by the industrial sector. The person in charge of the Shanghai Enamel Industry Company said: Shanghai's enamel products have been outdated in color and pattern for several years, and the artistic quality is very poor, and consumers have a lot of opinions. Moreover, with the improvement of people's material and cultural life, the requirements for the art design of industrial products will also become higher and higher. Using traditional Chinese painting to enrich the color and pattern of enamel products is just what we urgently need.

### 让国画更好地为工农兵和社会主义建设服务  上海11位国画家面向生产　两个月创作一百多幅脸盆和口杯的国画图案

    让国画更好地为工农兵和社会主义建设服务
    上海11位国画家面向生产
  　两个月创作一百多幅脸盆和口杯的国画图案
    本报讯　记者张风报道：上海十一位国画家正在两个搪瓷厂内参加劳动和进行搪瓷品的美术设计，试图通过国画结合工艺美术，使具有古老传统的国画艺术更广泛更有效地为工农兵和社会主义建设服务。两个月来，他们已经创作了一百多幅脸盆和口杯的国画图案，六十多幅已经制成成品，其中有花卉，有虫鸟，有人物。试销结果，消费者普遍认为搪瓷品的花色面目一新，试销品都很快销售一空。
    国画结合工艺美术。是上海中国画院筹备委员会不久前向全国国画界提出的一项倡议。他们提出：国画和道路宽广的工艺美术结合起来，就能解决国画面向生产、面向实用的问题，就能更好地为工农兵和社会主义建设服务。这样作的结果，既可以运用民族绘画风格提高工艺美术品的质量，又可以使国画家在劳动过程中进行思想改造，为国画服务于社会主义建设创造思想基础。王个簃、江寒汀、程十发、邵洛羊、唐云、李秋君、周练霞等十一位画家到两个搪瓷厂去，为国画结合工艺美术积累了经验。
    十一位国画家从下厂两个月的实践中，一致认为国画结合工艺美术，是一条正确的道路。他们认为：国画在它产生的时候，就是跟实用相结合的；在长期的发展过程中，也有与工艺美术相结合的一个方面。如古代的彩陶、宋人的团扇，直到现在，人们都认为有很高的艺术价值。只是在长期的封建社会中，国画被士大夫阶级所窃取，成了少数人独占的欣赏品，严重地脱离实际、脱离人民群众，鄙视国画与工艺美术相结合的一条实用的途径。国画家对于国画的传统，也要批判地继承。特别在今天的形势下，各方面都在大跃进，国画界也要大跃进，调动国画的一切积极因素为社会主义服务。这样，如果国画还局限在展出和一般的观赏，就不能满足人民群众的需要，也不能满足国画家要求更好地为建设服务的迫切心情。把画制成工艺品流传开去，就可以深入到每个家庭；这对美化人民生活，满足人民日益增长的文化要求，可以起很大作用。
    上海国画界提倡国画结合工艺美术，决不是排斥国画创作。相反地，通过结合工艺美术，画家参加体力劳动，克服脱离实际、脱离群众、自命清高、生活圈狭小的缺点，国画创作的质量也会提高。十一位画家两个月来在工厂中与工人同吃同住同劳动，普遍认为思想上有很大进步，与劳动人民感情上的距离大为缩短，他们除了为搪瓷品作设计外，还创作了几十幅国画，数量与质量都比过去提高。
    国画家们在为搪瓷品作美术设计中，首先从劳动中向工人们学习，掌握搪瓷生产的特点，使自己的创作适合于生产。程十发、唐云等人参加了喷花车间的劳动，学习喷花技术，和工人一起研究如何把国画图案喷得好。十一位国画家还开了一个国画辅导班，吸收搪瓷业中爱好美术的工人学习国画。这样，既培养了工人阶级的新的国画工作者，又可以使搪瓷工人掌握国画特点，提高凿板和喷花技术，把国画的艺术风格以至各个画家的独特风格，逼真地在搪瓷品上传达出来。上海国画界的这一创举受到工业部门的很大欢迎。上海搪瓷工业公司的负责人说：上海的搪瓷产品几年来花色陈旧，艺术性很差，消费者很有意见，而且随着人民物质和文化生活的提高，对工业品的美术设计的要求也会越来越高，运用国画来丰富搪瓷品的花色，正适合我们的急迫需要。
