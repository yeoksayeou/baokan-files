    Nanjing Agricultural College is implementing the policy of "teaching serving production." Utilizing the existing instruments, equipment, and laboratories of the Soil and Agricultural Chemistry Department, it has established a bacterial fertilizer manufacturing plant, producing rhizobia for soybeans, peanuts, green manure crops, and various nitrogen-fixing bacteria for crops. Currently, it has accepted orders from the Zhenjiang and Suzhou Regional Committees for a total of 2.4 million mu of soybean rhizobia. The Hubei Provincial Department of Agriculture has also sent people to negotiate an order for 400 tons of rhizobia (enough for seed inoculation of 32 million mu). Teachers and students of the entire department attend classes during the day and engage in production at night. As of April 8th, they had produced two tons of soybean rhizobia inoculum (enough for seed inoculation of 160,000 mu) to supply early soybean inoculation in Danyang County, Jiangsu, where the season starts early.

    南京农学院又办一个工厂
    南京农学院贯彻“教学为生产服务”的方针。利用土壤农化系现有仪器设备和实验室，又建立了一座细菌肥料制造厂，生产大豆、花生、绿肥作物根瘤菌和各种作物固氮菌。目前已接受镇江和苏州地委共二百四十万亩大豆根瘤菌的订货任务。湖北省农业厅还派人来接洽四百吨根瘤菌（可供三千二百万亩拌种用）的订货。全系师生白天上课，晚上生产，已于4月8日生产出大豆根瘤菌拌种剂二吨（可供十六万亩拌种用）供应季节较早的江苏丹阳县早大豆拌种。　（戈田）
