Title: Talking About Walking

In the city, one who knows how to walk, upon first arriving in the countryside, feels unable to move an inch and inevitably stumbles. This can be said as a fact, or as a metaphor. At least, that's how it was for me.

What is commonly called a road here is just the ridges of fields and ponds. After being walked on by many people, it becomes a white path, which is not difficult to recognize. However, it's a bit winding and circuitous. Even if you clearly want to go east, you have to turn south first. Only by following the path that the masses have walked out can you be on the right path and take a shortcut. If you carelessly take a wrong step at a fork in the road, you will waste a lot of time and even lose your way. The first step is very important. If this step is not taken correctly, you may still end up on a white path, but it will lead you in the opposite direction. Once you become familiar with it, practice makes perfect. You can cross idle fields, jump over small ditches, and find your own shortcuts.

When traveling a long distance, you must do so in one go, advancing bravely and directly. You can't stop and rest all the time, because if you do, your legs will ache and your feet will hurt. Appropriate breaks for lunch or lodging are exceptions. When marching collectively, those who walk slower should run a few steps to catch up. Otherwise, if you fall behind one step, you will fall behind step by step, and eventually, you will be left alone.

I once saw a cartoon that was a rectangular black block, titled: A Black Man Enters a Black Forest at Night. When I first walked at night, I had a similar feeling. I couldn't see my fingers in front of my face. I was a little afraid of falling, but I also wanted to show off my ability, so I walked recklessly and blindly, relying solely on brute force. As a result, I fell into a ditch and got covered in mud. I had to liberate my thinking, be down-to-earth, and honestly walk it a few times before I learned how to walk at night. Slowly, I learned that white means road, and black means ditch. Because villages are building small-scale water conservancy projects, the white paths are covered with new mud, changing their appearance, making it even easier to get lost at night. Anxious to get home, I turned around and around but couldn't find my way out. Suddenly, I looked up and saw a window with a light on. I hurried forward, knocked on the door, and asked for directions. It turned out that I had already walked into a neighboring village, less than a hundred steps from home. Once I was given directions, I was suddenly enlightened, thanked them repeatedly, picked up my bedding, and left. Before I knew it, I was home. Once bitten, twice shy. Next time, I will have experience, and my mood will still be cheerful.

    话说走路
    枚屋
    在城里会走路的，初下乡有寸步难行、不免摔跤之感。作为事实，或作为比喻来讲都可以。至少我是这样。
    这里惯称的大路，就是田埂塘埂，经人走多了，成了白花花的一条路，倒不难认。不过有点迂迴曲折，明明要朝东，先得向南拐，只有循着群众走出来的路走，才是正路，也抄近。不慎在三岔路口走错一步，就会走不少冤枉路，甚至迷失方向。第一步是很重要的，这一步没有走对，也许同样走上了白花花的道路，但却会背道而驰。走熟了，熟能生巧，尽管越过闲田，跳过小沟，自找捷径。
    赶长路要一鼓作气，勇往直前，不能时走时歇，一歇一坐，腿酸、脚痛都来了。打尖、宿店等适当休息不在此例。集体行军，走得慢一点的最好跑几步，迎头赶上，不然一步落后，步步落后，最后会成了蝺蝺独行。
    过去看过一幅漫画，是长方形的墨黑一块，题曰：黑人夜入黑森林。我初走夜路，似有这等感觉。伸手不见五指，有点怕跌斤斗，又想称能逞强，于是乱走胡闯，一味蛮干，结果掉进田沟，弄得泥泞满身。只得解放思想，脚踏实地，老老实实走它几回，才学会了走夜路。慢慢知道逢白是路，逢黑是沟。由于村村兴修小型水利，白花花的路上铺上了新泥，面貌改变，夜行更易迷途。急于回家，却转来转去转不出去。猛抬头，见前面有灯亮的窗户，急忙上前敲门问路，原来已经走进邻村，距家不出百步之外。一经指点，豁然开朗，连连称谢，挑起铺盖就走，不觉就到家了。吃一次亏，学一次乖，下回就有经验，心情还是愉快的。
