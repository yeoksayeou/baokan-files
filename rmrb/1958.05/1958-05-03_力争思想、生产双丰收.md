    Strive for a Double Harvest in Thought and Production

    After reading Comrade Yu Zhiming's letter, I feel that his understanding of how to transform and train himself in productive labor is unclear. Indeed, only through actual labor can one appreciate that "every grain of rice and every drop of gruel comes from hard work," and recognize that all material wealth in society is created by the people through diligent labor. However, is it enough to simply bury oneself in labor? Obviously, this is taking ideological transformation too simply. Actively engaging in labor, and through labor, learning production knowledge and the diligent and thrifty lifestyle of the peasants, is only the minimum requirement for us. If we want to truly receive comprehensive training, this is not enough. We must also try our best to participate in some social work that can be participated in in the countryside, and integrate with the masses in daily life. Only in this way can we learn more about the actual struggle experience in the countryside and the excellent ideological qualities of the peasants; only by sharing weal and woe with the peasants, and sharing their likes and dislikes, can we understand what they like, what they hate, what they support, and what they oppose, thereby further cultivating our class feelings and firming our class stand.

    What should be particularly mentioned is that the countryside now very much needs new-style farmers with culture like us, and requires us to shoulder dual tasks. Not only should we add a force in production, but also in terms of cultural knowledge, we should make contributions. So as to change the relatively backward face of rural cultural life. Especially some grassroots cadres with lower cultural levels, they urgently need our help, such as formulating production plans, doing records, recording work points, etc. Generally, we can take on such work. Take the comrades sent down by our unit as an example. At present, in addition to some people holding positions in the Party, Youth League organizations and production teams, all comrades are propagandists and literacy teachers here. They often publicize the Party's policies to the peasants and help them carry out cultural and recreational activities, which plays a certain role in enlivening rural life. Through these mass work, their relationship with us is closer, the more opportunities we have to contact with the peasants, the more thorough we understand, and the more harmonious our feelings are with each other, we can basically talk about everything, so that we can get more edification from the words and deeds of the peasant brothers. Facts have proved that doing social work is essential, it can greatly promote the mutual unity between new and old commune members, learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses, and it is also an important method of contacting the masses. Therefore, I hope that Comrade Yu will jump out of his small circle, change the situation of only caring about labor and earning more work points, and being indifferent to everything around him, actively participate in social work, and strive for a double harvest in thought and production!

    力争思想、生产双丰收
    读了余志明同志的来信，我感到他对怎样在生产劳动中改造和锻炼自己这个问题认识不清。的确，只有通过实际劳动，才会体会到“一粥一饭来处不易”，才能认识到社会上的一切物质财富，都是人民用辛勤劳动创造出来的。但，是不是单纯地埋头劳动就行了呢？显然，这是把思想改造看得太简单了。积极地进行劳动，通过劳动，可以向农民学习生产知识和勤劳俭朴的生活作风，这对我们来说仅仅是起码要求。要想使自己真正得到全面锻炼，这样是不够的，还必须尽力参加农村里可以参加的一些社会工作，在日常生活里与群众打成一片。这样才能更多地学到农村里的实际斗争经验和农民优秀的思想品质；只有与农民同甘苦，共好恶，才能了解他们喜欢什么，讨厌什么，拥护什么，反对什么，从而进一步培养我们的阶级情感，坚定我们的阶级立场。
    特别应该提到的是，现在农村里很需要我们这样有文化的新式农民，要求我们肩负双重任务。不仅要在生产上增添一份力量，而且在文化知识方面，也应做出贡献。从而改变现在农村文化生活比较落后的面貌。尤其是一些文化水平较低的基层工作干部，更迫切需要我们帮助，比如制订生产计划、做做记录、记工分等，像这样的工作，一般我们是可以担当的。就拿现在我们单位下放的同志来说，目前除一部分人在党、团组织和生产队中兼任一些职务外，所有同志都是这里的宣传员和扫盲教员。经常向农民宣传党的方针政策，帮他们开展文化娱乐活动，对活跃农村生活起到一定作用。通过这些群众工作，他们与我们的关系更加密切了，我们和农民接触机会愈多，了解的愈透，彼此感情愈融洽，基本上做到了无话不谈，这样我们就可以从农民兄弟的言语行动中，得到更多的教益。事实证明，做社会工作是必不可少的，它能够大大促进新、老社员之间的相互团结，取长补短，而且也是联系群众的重要方法。因此，我希望余同志跳出自己的小圈子，改变那种只顾劳动、多挣工分，对周围的一切漠不关心的情况，积极参加社会工作，力争思想、生产双丰收！
