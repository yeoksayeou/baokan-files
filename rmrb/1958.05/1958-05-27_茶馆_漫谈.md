Rambling on "Teahouse"
　　Zhang Geng

Mr. Lao She's "Teahouse" has recently been staged at the Beijing People's Art Theatre, attracting considerable attention from the audience. It has also become a topic of conversation and gatherings within the literary and art circles. In short, it is one of the more notable events in the recent Beijing literary and art scene. Indeed, since liberation, Mr. Lao She's play "Dragon Beard Ditch," with its Beijing life theme, has left the audience with an unforgettable impression. Everyone unanimously felt that such a strong Beijing flavor had never been seen on stage before. Not long ago, Comrade Mei Qian adapted Mr. Lao She's famous work "Rickshaw Boy" and brought it to the "People's Art Theatre" stage, again winning strong reactions from rickshaw pullers and praise from the literary and art circles. This time, as soon as the "Teahouse" script came out, the literary and art circles paid great attention. The Literary Gazette convened a symposium; the "People's Art Theatre" announced that it was already rehearsing the play, and many people were waiting to see it. Because the "People's Art Theatre" was performing Lao She's work, everyone predicted that there would be a good show.

Lao She's play is a huge painting, with more than seventy characters appearing on stage, the vast majority of whom speak and have names; the time span is fifty years, with several characters running through from beginning to end, almost all of whom are written from their twenties to their seventies. The era is so long, the historical events so many; the characters so mixed, and the social scope involved so wide; only a writer with rich social and writing experience would dare to write it.

Although there are many characters and the era is long, the author uses very little ink, only writing 30,000 words. From this, we can see that the author is highly summarizing the characters and the times. A great feature of this play is its conciseness: a character, with very little ink, almost just a sentence or two, is given an outline. For example, in the first act, the play opens with Er Dezi running amok in the teahouse, beating people, and smashing the teahouse. But at this time, Master Ma comes out from the corner. The author wrote this dialogue:

Ma: (Without standing up) Er Dezi, you are very powerful!

De: (Looks around, sees Ma) Oh, Master Ma, you are here? I'm sorry, I didn't see you! (Goes over to greet him.)

Ma: Talk things over properly. Why do you always resort to fighting?

De: Yes! You're right! I'll go sit in the back. Li San, I'll pay for the tea here later! (Walks to the back.)

Chang (Note: Er Dezi's opponent in the argument.): (Comes over, wants to complain to Ma) Sir, you are wise, please judge fairly!

Ma: (Stands up) I have something to do, goodbye! (Walks out.)

Master Ma is only represented by these few sentences, but from them, we can see his prestige. This person was a so-called "Christian" at the time, and even the government feared them. Such a character with "epochal color," or, in other words, a character who is an important part of this play, is only given three opportunities to speak by the author. It can be seen how rich the character portrayal is in sketches. Comparing this with Gorky's "The Lower Depths," which also has an unconcentrated story and many characters, it can be seen that it does not excavate the souls of the characters in depth like "The Lower Depths," but rather sketches the era in a broad mass scene.

This special style of play, when in the hands of directors and actors, requires enormous creative labor to express the playwright's intentions. For example, what does a character like Master Ma look like, how is he dressed, what kind of expression does he have, and what kind of tone does he speak with? The actors must put a lot of effort into pondering these aspects. As for the director, things may be even more numerous, at least no less than the actors. Let's take Master Ma as an example. The script stipulates that this character is sitting in an inconspicuous place and speaks in the chaotic atmosphere on stage not long after the opening, says three sentences in total, and then leaves the stage, never to appear again. So, what method does the director use to make the audience recognize what kind of person he is? Here, director Jiao Juyin and director Xia Chun put a lot of effort into it. For example, when Master Ma leaves the stage, he walks to the center of the stage, and suddenly the sound of church bells rings from backstage. This gentleman immediately stands upright, takes off his Western priest-style black felt hat, and respectfully makes the sign of the cross. At this time, the audience suddenly realizes that he is a Christian.

The actors and various artists on the stage have also put in creative labor in this play. All their efforts must first make the outlines of the characters on stage clear and their characteristics prominent. If this cannot be done, then with more than seventy people on stage in a chaotic manner, who will the audience recognize? I have indeed seen plays where many characters appear on stage but fail to impress the audience, and such plays are destined to fail. However, "Teahouse" completely avoids this problem. From the performances, the reciting of lines, and the costumes, the artists strive to create the external forms of the characters, so that these numerous characters on stage have clear contrasts with each other, highlighting the differences in their status, occupation, age, and personality; although they occupy a small position on the stage, they still leave an impression on the audience. For example, Chang Siye and Song Erye, the director first makes them have a contrast between tall and short in the choice of external forms, and the actors also have different rhythms in their performances and the recitation of their lines. Of course, the playwright has given very appropriate regulations on these things in the concise script, and these two characters are also the main roles, with many lines and events, providing a rich creative basis. However, even Huang Pangzi, Er Dezi, Cui Jiufeng, and Zou Fuyuan, who only appear in one scene, can ponder many things from the inside out of the characters in the lines given by the author, so that they can all stand vividly on the stage and live on the stage. This is not easy.

Regarding the performance, I would like to say a few more words casually. This time, the achievements in this area are indeed great. The walk-on characters who don't speak much, which were mentioned earlier, are performed really well, and I won't repeat them here. Just talking about a few main roles, such as Yu Shi Zhi, Zheng Rong, Lan Tianye, Liang Jing, Rong Yuan, and Jin Hesheng, they play from young to old, while Ying Ruocheng, Zhang Tong, Ma Qun, Lin Liankun, and Li Daqian play from old to young again. It is these characters that string the play together, and they really perform well. One person plays both father and son, and this idea is very good. Some comrades do not quite agree with the transmission of generations, but I think that it is precisely because of this transmission of generations that the play is strung together. From this transmission of generations, the development of the times can be seen. In particular, Little Liu Ma Zi for Liu Ma Zi, that is really "to carry forward," such places, the script is written very well, the actors also performed very well.

By saying this, I do not mean that I have no opinions on "Teahouse" at all. I love Mr. Lao She's writing style. Especially, he has made great efforts in creating stage language, which is invaluable. I also love the "People's Art Theatre's" performance style, their untiring artistic labor and bold creativity, and their artistic meticulousness and concise style. But I also have some requirements, especially when our drama is facing the task of reflecting the socialist reality and building a socialist national new drama. These requirements or hopes may be excessive, but as an audience member, and also representing a part of the audience, I think it is still right to put them forward for reference.

For example, the author's emotion in "Teahouse" is to bury the cursed past era, and also to write an elegy for the old era, but the author is not absolutely without writing odes for our patriotic people in the past. "Teahouse" exposes the ugliness of the old society and also writes about the unfortunate encounters of the good characters among them, making us have hatred, sympathy, and regret; but it also sings with full enthusiasm of patriotic characters like Chang Siye, who are chivalrous and passionate. Chang Siye was a courageous and bloody man when he was young. Even in middle age, he earns his living by working, but he still has a patriotic enthusiasm and can still make bold remarks. The author extracts such a person from the colorful characters and puts him in a prominent position on the stage, which shows that the play "Teahouse" should not only bury the past, not only sing elegies, but also have an ode aspect.

But there is indeed a major shortcoming here, that is, special agents, hooligans, human traffickers, and fortune tellers all have descendants, and even the teahouse owner can have descendants, but only Chang Siye and others like him have no descendants. I am not saying that there must be a Little Chang Siye, but that after the Reform Movement of 1898, there was the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. At least one or two representative figures of this generation of new people should have a clearer appearance on the stage. The two students who were arrested still seem to be just a blurred shadow; we have a Kang Dali, but he is too young in the second act, and he leaves again in the third act, which feels a bit empty; the two striking teachers also seem relatively powerless. How can we give us a few powerful sketches in this regard?

Many people feel that the first act is really brilliant, while the third act is slightly inferior. This is probably because the atmosphere of the teahouse in the first act is particularly strong. Reformists, reactionaries, reformers, and other colorful characters are active in it. The sharp dialogue between Grand Eunuch Pang and Qin Zhongyi is really a typical conversation between typical characters of that era, so it can grab people's hearts so much. In the second act, the main figures on the stage are only soldiers and special agents. The patriotic students are just a silhouette, and the only one who can express a little negative complaint is Cui Jiufeng, a Buddhist member of parliament. In the third act, the tone seems even lower. Although things are brewing behind the scenes, the characters finally do not appear. In front of the curtain, some people are more cartoonish, and others are older, without any accomplishments, and are preparing for their funerals. Therefore, we are left with the impression that this teahouse was originally in the center of a boiling era, but later it was increasingly squeezed to the edge and even to a remote corner, becoming increasingly insufficient to reflect the appearance of the era.

Mr. Jiao Juyin painstakingly wants to create a strong atmosphere in the backstage, or simply a play, to forcefully draw out this red line behind the scenes. He has indeed made many creative attempts in the stage effects, and also created a certain atmosphere, but this approach is far from enough to remedy the aforementioned shortcomings. After all, the play is centered on performing arts. Stage effects can fulfill a certain task, and can even fulfill a huge task in certain key areas, such as the church bells when Master Ma leaves the stage in the first act; but it cannot express what the playwright has not given a play emotionally and ideologically.

I think the fundamental point of this play is that the author's mood of mourning is too heavy. He hates the old era, but he has too much lingering affection for some old people in the old era. Mourning is also human nature, and it is not something to criticize, but in contrast, it seems somewhat indifferent to those who also lived in the old era, but were enthusiastically and vigorously fighting in it, and even gave their lives. This point is difficult for the director and actors to remedy only by means of stage images.

In addition, this script also has some structural shortcomings: for example, Qin Zhongyi does not appear in the second act. From the audience's psychology, it is easy to forget him, and it is not too difficult or unnecessary for him to appear in the second act.

In order to properly express the image in his mind, the author has to painstakingly seek expression forms. He cannot always do things so conventionally. When the theater accepts this script, it must pay attention to cherishing the author's literary creation and carefully explore the author's intentions for expressing it in this way, so that it can express the characteristics of a writer. The "Teahouse" performance group has done this very well. At the same time, the playwright should also grasp the characteristics of the stage and be familiar with expressing their literary intentions and controlling the emotions of the audience in front of one or two thousand viewers within this length, width, and height. Mr. Lao She is also an expert in this regard. However, due to the urgent need to seek suitable expression forms, some difficulties in stage expression are inevitable. In some places in Mr. Lao She's play, for example, Qin Zhongyi does not appear in the second act, which inevitably becomes a defect.

"Teahouse" is very successful both in playwriting and performance. The opinions I have put forward are only in the hope that it will be more perfect. They may not be accurate, but I put them forward for reference.

### “茶馆”漫谈

    “茶馆”漫谈
  　张庚
    老舍先生的“茶馆”最近在北京人艺剧院上演了，很受观众的注意，也成了文艺界私人谈话和集会中间的话题，总之，是最近北京文艺方面比较惹人注目的事件之一。的确的，解放以来老舍先生以北京生活为题材的剧本“龙须沟”曾经在舞台上给予观众以难忘的印象，大家一致感到这么浓的北京味以前在舞台上的确是没有见过的。前不久梅阡同志又改编了老舍先生的名作“骆驼祥子”，并把它搬上了“人艺”的舞台，又获得了三轮车工人的强烈反应和文艺界的好评。这次“茶馆”剧本一出来，文艺界就非常注意，文艺报就召开了座谈会；“人艺”宣布已经在排这个戏了，许多人就等着要看。因为“人艺”演老舍的作品，大家预感着一定有好戏可看。
    老舍这个戏是一幅巨大的画，其中上场人物多至七十以上，绝大多数都是开口讲话的、有名有姓的人物；时间也延绵五十年，其中有几个贯串到底的人物，差不多都是从二十多岁被写到七十多岁的。年代如此之长，经过的历史事件如此之多；出场的人物如此之杂，所涉及的社会面又如此之广，不是富有社会经验和写作经验的作家，谁敢下笔呢？
    人物虽然多，年代虽然长，但是作者所用的笔墨却不多，只写了三万字，在这点上又可看出作者是高度概括地在描写着人物和时代的。这个剧本的很大一个特点就是简洁：一个人物，费很少的笔墨，差不多只是一两句话，就给它勾出一个轮廓来。比方第一幕，一开场就写了二德子在茶馆里横行霸道，动手打人，还砸茶馆，但这时从角落里出来一位马五爷，作者写了这样一段对话：
    马：（并未立起）二德子，你威风啊！
    德：（四下扫视，看到马）喝，马五爷，您在这儿哪？我可眼拙，没看见您！（过去请安。）
    马：有什么事好好地说，干吗动不动地就讲打？
    德：?！您说的对！我到后头坐坐去。李三，这儿的茶钱我候啦！（往后面走去。）
    常（注：二德子吵架的对方。）：（凑过来，要对马发牢骚）这位爷，您圣明，您给评评理！
    马：（立起来）我还有事，再见！（走出去。）
    马五爷这个人物就只这么几句话，但我们却从中看出了他的威风。这个人是一个当时所谓“吃洋教的”，连官府也怕他们三分。这样一个富有“时代色彩”的人物，或者说在这戏里作为一个重要组成部分的人物，作者也只给他说三句话的机会，可见在这戏里，人物描写是多么富有速写的味道，这一点，拿来和高尔基同样是故事不集中，人物也较多的“夜店”相比，就看出它完全不像夜店那样纵深地去挖掘人物的灵魂，而是在广阔的群众场面里给时代画素描。
    这种特殊风格的戏，拿到导演和演员的手里，非得费巨大的创造性劳动就无法表现剧作者的意图。比方像马五爷这样的人物，到底是个什么样子，怎么个打扮，是一副什么神气，说话带着一种什么腔调，现在的演员就必得下很多工夫去琢磨；至于导演，事情可能就更多，至少不比演员少。还是拿马五爷来做例子罢。这个人物，剧本规定是坐在一个不显眼的地方，在开场不久台上乱哄哄的气氛中就说话了，一共说了三句就下了场，从此不再登场，那么导演用什么法子让观众认识他是什么人物呢？在这里，导演焦菊隐先生和导演夏淳同志下了许多工夫，比如在马五爷下场时，走到台正中，幕后忽然响起了教堂的钟声，这位爷立刻站得端端正正，摘下头上西洋神父式的黑呢帽，必恭必敬地画起十字来。这时观众恍然大悟了，原来是吃洋教的。
    演员和舞台上的各种艺术家在这个戏里也都付出了创造性的劳动。他们的一切努力，首先要使得出场人物的轮廓鲜明，特点突出。这一点如果不能办到，七十多人在舞台上乱哄哄的，让观众去认识谁去？上场人物多而不能给观众以印象，这样的戏我也的确见过，那是非失败不可的。在“茶馆”这个戏里却完全没有这个毛病。从表演上、念台词上、以及服装等等各方面，艺术家们努力创造了人物的外形，使得这众多的人物在一台上，彼此之间有了鲜明的对比，衬出形形色色的地位、职业、年龄、性格的区别来；虽然在舞台上所占的地位不大，仍旧各自给观众留下了印象。比方常四爷和松二爷，导演首先在外形选择上就让他们有高大与矮小的对比，而演员在表演上、台词的朗诵上也有各自不同的节奏。当然，这些东西剧作者在简洁的剧本上都给了很恰当的规定，而且这两个人物也是主要角色，台词多，事件多，有丰富的创造根据。不过即如黄胖子、二德子、崔久峰、邹福远这些人，也只是一场戏，演员能在作者所给的台词中琢磨出人物从内到外的许多东西，让它们都能形象地立在台上，活在台上，这是不容易的。
    关于表演，我率性再多谈几句。这次这方面的成绩的确很大。前面提过的话说得不多的过场人物演得实在好，这里不再重复了。单说几个主要角色，像于是之、郑榕、兰天野、梁菁还有容元、金荷生几位，是从年轻演到年老，而英若诚、张瞳、马群、林连琨、李大千几位又是从年老又演回年青。就是靠着这几个人物将戏贯串起来，而他们实在演得不错。一个人扮了父亲又扮儿子，这个设想是很好的。有的同志不大赞成传代，我却认为正因为有了这个传代，戏才贯串起来。从这个传代中间，看出了时代的发展。特别小刘麻子对于刘麻子，那真是“发扬光大”，这种地方，剧本写得真好，演员也演得真好。
    我这样说，并不是对“茶馆”一点意见也没有了。我是爱好老舍先生的文风的。特别是他为舞台语言的创造上尽了很大的劳力，更是功不可没。我也爱“人艺”这种演出作风，爱他们不疲倦的艺术劳动和大胆的创造性，爱他们艺术上的细致和简洁的风格。但是我也还有一些要求，特别在我们戏剧面临着反映社会主义的现实生活，建设社会主义的民族新戏剧的任务的时候。这些要求或者希望也许是过奢的，但作为一个观众，同时又代表一部分观众，提出来供参考，我想还是应该的。
    比方“茶馆”作者的情绪是在埋葬过去那些可诅咒的时代，又是在写一首对旧时代的挽歌，但是作者也并不是绝对没有为我们过去的爱国人民写颂歌。“茶馆”暴露了旧社会的丑恶，也写了其中善良人物的不幸遭遇，使我们有憎恨有同情和叹惜；但是也以充沛的热情歌诵了常四爷这样侠骨豪情的爱国人物。常四爷在年轻的时候是一个有胆识的血性男子，就是到了中年，以劳动自食其力，但仍有一腔爱国热情，仍旧能作豪语。这样的人，作者把他从形形色色的人物中间提出来放到舞台上显著的地位，这就可见“茶馆”这一个戏应当不止于埋葬，不止于唱挽歌，还有颂歌的一面。
    但这里的确存在着较大的缺点，那就是特务，流氓、人贩子、看相的都有后代，甚至于茶馆老板都可以有后代，唯独像常四爷这样的人却没有后代。我不是说必须再来一个小常四爷，而是说，戊戌之后，有辛亥革命，有五四运动，有大革命，有土地革命，有抗战、这一代一代的新人，至少应当有个把代表人物在舞台上有比较清晰的面貌。被抓走的两个学生似乎还只是一点模糊的影子；我们有一个康大力，但他第二幕的时候太小，第三幕又走了，觉得有点空虚；两个罢课的教员也显得比较无力。怎么能在这方面给我们几笔有力的素描呢？
    许多人都感觉第一幕真精采，而第三幕稍差。这恐怕是在第一幕里，茶馆的时代气氛特别浓厚的缘故。革新派，反动派、改良派等形形色色的人物都在其中活跃，像庞太监和秦仲义两个人那种针锋相对的谈话实在是那个时代典型人物的典型谈话，所以就那么能抓住人心。到了第二幕，在舞台上占主要地位的就只是大兵、特务这些人，爱国的学生不过成了一个剪影，还能表现一点消极牢骚的，只剩下一个念佛的国会议员崔久峰了。到了第三幕，调子就显得更低沉，虽然幕后在酝酿着事情，但人物终于没有出场，在幕前的，一部分人更漫画化了，另一部分人呢，更老了，无所作为了，都在准备后事了。因此给我们留下一个印象，仿佛这个茶馆本来是处在沸腾着的时代中心，以后却越来越被挤到边沿以至冷僻的角落里去了，越来越不足以反映时代的风貌了。
    焦菊隐先生煞费苦心要在后台创造一种浓郁的气氛，或者简直是一台戏，来把这幕后的一条红线有力地划出来。他在舞台效果上的确做出了许多创造性的尝试，而且也制造了一定的气氛，但是这一种做法远不能补救前面所说的缺点。究竟戏是以表演艺术为中心的东西，舞台效果能尽它一定的任务，在某些关键上甚至能尽巨大的任务，比方第一幕马五爷下场时的教堂钟声；但是它不能把剧作者感情上、思想上所未曾给予一个剧本的东西表现出来。
    我觉得这个戏里的根本之点，在于作者悼念的心情太重。他对旧时代是痛恨的，但对旧时代里的某些旧人却有过多的低徊凭吊之情。凭吊也是人之常情，未可厚非，但相形之下，对于那些也是生活在旧时代，但却在其中热情蓬勃地斗争着，甚至付出了自己生命的人们仿佛有些冷淡了。这一点，导演和演员仅凭舞台形象上的设法，是难以补救的。
    另外，这个剧本也存在某些结构上的缺点：比方秦仲义在二幕没有出场，从观众心理来说，就容易忘了他，而他在第二幕出现又是不太困难的，甚至还是很必要的。
    作者为了恰当地表现他脑子里的形象，不得不苦心寻求表现形式，他不能老是那么循规蹈矩去做。当剧场接受了这个剧本以后，必须注意十分珍惜作者文学上的创造，小心去探索作者其所以如此表现的意图，然后才能把一个作家的特点表现出来。这一点，“茶馆”的演出集团是做得很好的。同时，剧作者也应当掌握舞台的特点，熟悉在这块长宽高的范围之内，一两千个观众的面前来表达自己的文学意图，控制观众的情绪。老舍先生在这方面也是行家。但由于寻求适合的表现形式很迫切，有时也不免造成一些舞台上表现的困难。老舍先生这个戏在有些地方，比方秦仲义在第二幕没有出场等，未免就成为一种缺陷。
    “茶馆”无论在剧作上或演出上都是很成功的。我所提出的这些意见只是希望它更完善，可能不准确，提出来作参考罢。
