    Due to early preparations and timely sowing, Funan County, Anhui Province, maintained the initiative from planting to harvesting wheat last year, resulting in a comprehensive bumper harvest this wheat season. Preliminary estimates indicate that the average yield of wheat and barley throughout the county is over 200 jin per mu, a 64% increase in yield per unit area compared to last year, and a two and a half-fold increase compared to the initial liberation in 1949. There are 420,000 mu of high-yield wheat fields, with an average yield of 350 jin per mu, including over 10,000 mu yielding 500 to over 1,000 jin per mu. Such a large-scale bumper harvest is unprecedented in Funan County.

    Funan County is located on the north bank of the Huai River, historically a disaster-prone area. The annual rainfall is 800 to 1,000 millimeters, but its distribution is extremely uneven, with summer rainfall accounting for more than half, while autumn rainfall is scarce. Therefore, the county often experiences floods followed by droughts. In the past, although Funan County had the saying, "Sow wheat during the Autumnal Equinox, delay until the Frost's Descent, sowing during the Cold Dew is just right," due to frequent autumn droughts and insufficient labor and livestock, most of the arable land could not be sown during the Cold Dew period. Sowing often started in the eighth month and dragged on until the twelfth month, lasting more than seven months. Due to untimely sowing and extensive cultivation, the wheat yield in the county was consistently low. Before liberation, the average yield was only 60 to 70 jin per mu. After liberation, there was a significant improvement, but last year's yield was still only over 130 jin. The Funan County Committee of the Communist Party of China seriously studied and analyzed the historical situation, climate, rainfall, and other natural conditions of the county. It particularly analyzed the lessons of 1954 and 1955. In the autumn of 1954, the county encountered an autumn drought and was busy with production for disaster relief, so the wheat was sown very late, not until December. Later, due to strengthened management and increased fertilization, the wheat grew well. However, the following year, when the wheat was growing vigorously but not yet fully mature, it encountered a severe southwest wind. Because the season had arrived, the wheat was scorched by the hot wind. The original estimate was 100 jin per mu, but the actual yield was only 80 jin. What was the reason for this "good-looking but not harvestable" situation? The main reason was late sowing. In the autumn of 1955, there was another autumn drought. Drought resistance and wheat sowing were delayed until December. That year, the wheat also grew well, but the following spring, jaundice disease became widespread. Due to late sowing, the wheat stalks were not strong, and most were local varieties with weak disease resistance, resulting in a yield of only 20 to 30 jin per mu. Based on the lessons of previous years, the county committee concluded that early preparation and timely sowing are the primary keys to a bumper wheat harvest.

    Last year, the Funan County Committee paid special attention to autumn planting early on, determined to completely reverse the passive situation of late wheat sowing in the past. As early as the summer harvest, the county committee instructed the entire county to select and retain good seeds, and began to pay attention to preparing for wheat sowing. In August, the county committee made comprehensive arrangements for land preparation, moisture conservation, seed inspection, timely manure delivery, and inspection of livestock and farm implements. In mid-September, after a light rain, the county committee immediately mobilized for a concentrated effort to rush-plow and conserve moisture. At this time, it was the autumn harvest season, and it was generally possible to harvest, plow, and harrow simultaneously. Because some livestock had to be used for the autumn harvest, there was a shortage of livestock. In order to conserve moisture without losing time, the county mobilized more than 100,000 people to pull plows and harrows, conserving moisture on more than 1 million mu of arable land. In late September, the county committee convened another three-level cadre meeting to further concretely arrange and inspect autumn planting preparations, arrange labor, livestock, tasks, and moisture conditions, calculate the accounts for seeds and fertilizers, and conduct a major inspection of farm implements. In this way, the county had completed all preparations for autumn planting by the end of September, taking the initiative from the start. Last autumn, there were more than two months without significant rain, and it was another autumn drought. To ensure timely sowing, the county launched a large-scale drought resistance and rush-planting campaign. From October 5th to 9th, the county committee held three consecutive telephone and broadcast meetings, timely criticizing the complacent thinking in areas with better soil moisture and the hesitant and wait-and-see thinking in areas with poorer soil moisture, pointing out the need to immediately engage in battle and ensure that all wheat was sown well around the Cold Dew and before the Frost's Descent. During the drought resistance and rush-planting campaign, cadres at all levels and the masses in the county shared weal and woe. The county party secretary and county head personally took the lead and participated in drought resistance. Thanks to the total mobilization and arduous struggle of the entire county, the task of planting more than 1.5 million mu of wheat was completed in only half a month, not only victoriously overcoming the drought but also completing the task ten to fifteen days earlier than in previous years, ensuring timely sowing before the Frost's Descent.

    Last year, Funan County not only paid special attention to seizing timely sowing when planting wheat, but also paid attention to deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, thoroughly changing the past habit of extensive cultivation. Last year, the county vigorously promoted new-style farm implements, with more than 5,800 double-wheeled double-share plows. In the past, Funan County's plowing of wheat fields was "plowing without three inches of soil." After the extensive use of double-wheeled double-share plows last year, it was generally possible to plow to a depth of four and a half to five inches. About 40% of all wheat fields were plowed twice, and 10% were plowed three times. In the past, Funan County rarely applied fertilizer when planting wheat. Last year, the base fertilizer applied to wheat land was 120 dan per mu. During the wheat growing season, fertilizer was applied once in stages, with up to four applications in high-yield areas, totaling 400 dan per mu, more than three times the amount compared to 1956. During the wheat growing season, the county's farmers also timely carried out the fight against frost, insects, and diseases. In March and April, the county mobilized more than 200,000 people to light fires to prevent frost twice, and eradicated water wireworms, red spiders, and other pests in more than 700,000 mu of wheat fields. In April and May, the county mobilized more than 200,000 people to universally prevent and control stem rust in more than 1 million mu of wheat fields.

    A responsible person of the Funan County Committee told reporters that the comprehensive bumper harvest this wheat season makes the benefits of timely wheat sowing even clearer. Wheat sown in a timely manner not only matures earlier and has fuller grains because it is sown early, but also grows stronger and has strong disease resistance because it is sown early. This spring, when stem rust occurred, timely sown good varieties of wheat had a disease rate of only 6% to 25% because the wheat stalks were strong, while some local varieties of wheat that were sown late had a disease rate of 100% because the wheat stalks were tender and weak. The responsible person said that Funan County's summer harvest is about to begin comprehensively. In order to prepare for wheat planting this autumn as early as possible, the county committee has made specific arrangements for on-field seed selection.

    安徽省阜南县去年种麦由于提早准备，适时播种，从种到收始终掌握了主动，今年麦季获得全面大丰收。据初步估计，全县的小麦和大麦平均每亩可收二百多斤，比去年单位面积产量增加64％，比1949年初解放时的单位面积产量增产二倍半。有四十二万亩丰产麦，平均每亩可收三百五十斤，其中有一万多亩每亩可收五百斤到一千多斤。这样大面积的丰产，在阜南县是从来没有过的。
    阜南县位于淮河北岸，在历史上是个多灾的地区。年雨量有八百到一千公厘，但分布却极不平衡，夏季雨量占一半以上，而秋季雨量很少，因此这个县经常是先涝后旱。过去，阜南县虽然有“秋分早，霜降迟，寒露种麦正当时”的谚语，但是因为常遇夹秋旱，而且劳畜力不足，实际上大部分耕地不能做到寒露种麦，往往是八月种到腊，要拖七个多月。由于播种不能适时，加上耕作粗放，这个县的小麦产量一向很低。解放前平均每亩只能收六七十斤，解放后有了很大提高，但去年单产也只有一百三十多斤。中共阜南县委认真研究和分析了这个县的历史情况，气候和雨量等自然情况。并着重分析了1954年和1955年的教训。这个县在1954年秋季，因为遇到夹秋旱，又忙于生产救灾，麦子种得很迟，一直种到12月，以后由于加强管理多施肥，麦子长得很好，可是第二年当麦子正在旺盛成长还没有完全成熟的时候，遇到严重的西南风，因为季节已到，麦子被热风吹枯，原来估计每亩可收一百斤，实际只收八十斤。经看不经收的原因何在？主要是种迟了。1955年秋季又是夹秋旱，抗旱种麦，一直拖到12月。这一年，麦子也长得很好，可是第二年春季、普遍发生黄疽病，由于种得迟，麦秆不硬，大部又是本地麦种，抗病力极弱，结果每亩只收二、三十斤。根据历年来的教训，县委研究以后得出的经验是：提早准备，适时播种，是小麦能否丰产的首要关键。
    去年，阜南县委对秋种抓得特别早，决定彻底扭转过去种麦种得迟的被动局面。早从夏收时起，县委就布置全县选留良种，开始注意做种麦的准备工作。8月份，县委对整地保墒，检查种子，及时送粪，检查畜力和农具，全面作了安排。到9月中旬，下了一场小雨，县委立即动员突击抢耕保墒，这时正当秋收，一般都做到了边收、边耕、边耙。由于一部分畜力要用于秋收，畜力不足，为了保墒不失时机，全县曾动员十万多人拉犁拉耙，使一百多万亩耕地保了墒。9月下旬，县委再召开三级干部会议，进一步具体安排和检查秋种准备工作，做好劳力、畜力、任务、墒情的排队，算了种子和肥料的账，又对农具进行大检查。这样，在9月底以前，全县秋种的准备工作就已全部做好，一开始就掌握了主动。去年秋季有两个多月没有下透雨，又是夹秋旱。为了保证适时播种，全县发动了一个大规模的抗旱抢种运动。在10月5日到9日五天中，县委连续召开三次电话会议和广播会议，及时批判了墒情较好地区的麻痹思想和墒情较差地区的畏难等待思想，指出立即投入战斗，一定要保证在寒露前后到霜降以前把麦全部种好。在抗旱抢种运动中，全县各级干部和群众同甘共苦，县委书记、县长都亲自带头，参加抗旱。由于全县总动员，艰苦奋斗，只有半个月的时间，就全部完成了种麦一百五十多万亩的任务，不但胜利战胜了干旱，而且比往年提早了十天到半个月，保证做到了霜降前适时播种。
    阜南县去年种麦不仅特别注意抓住适时播种，而且注意深耕细作，彻底改变了过去耕作粗放的习惯。去年全县大力推广了新式农具、双轮双铧犁就有五千八百多部。过去阜南县翻犁麦地是“犁无三寸土”，去年大量用双轮双铧犁以后，一般可耕到四寸半到五寸深。全部麦地约有40％耕过两遍，10％耕过三遍。过去阜南县种麦很少施肥，去年种麦上的基肥每亩有一百二十担。在麦子成长期中又分期追了一次肥，其中丰产地追肥达四次，总计施肥量每亩达四百担，如与1956年相比，增加了三倍以上。在麦子成长期中，全县农民又及时进行了防霜、防虫、防病的斗争。3、4月份，全县曾动员二十多万人两次点火防霜，并在七十多万亩麦地里扑灭水金针虫，红蜘蛛等虫害。4、5月份，全县又动员二十多万人在一百多万亩麦地里普遍防治了秆锈病。
    阜南县委一位负责人对记者说，从今年麦季的全面丰收可以更加清楚地看出小麦适时播种的好处。适时播种的小麦不但因为种得早，成熟期早，颗粒饱满，而且因为种得早，长得壮，抗病力很强。如今春发生秆锈病的时候，适时播种的良种小麦因为麦秆健壮，发病率只有6％到25％，而有些种得迟的本地种小麦，由于麦秆嫩弱，发病达到100％；这位负责人说，阜南县的夏收即将全面开始了，为了及早准备今年秋季种麦，县委对田间选种已作了具体布置。
