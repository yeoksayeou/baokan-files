　　Tianshui County Communes to Build Biogas Stations
　　(Our newspaper's dispatch from Lanzhou, May 13th) In order to accelerate the transformation of the backward rural areas, Gansu Province will universally establish biogas stations in the broad countryside. The first biogas station was put into operation on April 22nd in Shima Ping, on the outskirts of Tianshui City. From the start of construction of the fermentation tank to the release of biogas, the entire process took forty-eight days. Guests from the Lanzhou suburban farmers' visiting group, while drinking water boiled using biogas, praised the lighting with biogas. In addition to lighting and cooking, biogas can also be used for power generation, water pumping, and welding. Therefore, the widespread establishment of biogas stations in rural areas will greatly contribute to the development of local small-scale industry, the innovation of agricultural technology, and the resolution of fuel shortages for many farmers in mountainous areas of Gansu. The Tianshui Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has decided to realize biogasification throughout the entire region this year, as an important step in realizing the semi-mechanization of agriculture. The more than four thousand agricultural cooperatives in the entire prefecture will establish biogas stations in three phases: fifty-two will be developed in the second quarter, two thousand four hundred will be developed in the third quarter, and in the fourth quarter, every commune will have a biogas station. Currently, the prefecture is starting to prepare for the establishment of a biogas school at the Shima Ping biogas station to train technical personnel for the entire province. (Zhai Qiyin)

　　天水县社社要建沼气站
    本报兰州13日电　为了加速改变农村落后面貌，甘肃省将在广大农村普遍建立沼气站。第一座沼气站已于4月22日在天水市郊石马坪开始发电。从动工兴建发酵池，到开放沼气历时共四十八天。兰州郊区农民参观团的客人们，一面喝着用沼气煮沸的水，一面对用沼气点灯赞不绝口。沼气除了用于照明烧饭外，还能用来发电、抽水和焊接。因此，在农村广泛建立沼气站，对发展地方小型工业，革新农业技术和解决甘肃许多山区农民缺乏燃料的困难，将会有很大贡献。中共天水地委决定今年在全区实现沼气化，作为实现农业半机械化的重要步骤之一。全专区四千多个农业社的沼气站将分三期建立：第二季度发展五十二个，第三季度发展二千四百个，第四季度达到社社有沼气站。现在，这个专区正在石马坪沼气站着手筹建沼气学校，给全省培训技术人材。（翟其寅）
