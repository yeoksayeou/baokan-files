    Boiled flour, rice flour, and various animal glues all have viscosity, and we often use this viscosity to glue wood, cotton cloth, paper, etc. However, most of these glues are afraid of water. Once they come into contact with water, their viscosity decreases. They are also afraid of many microorganisms, because microorganisms can slowly cause them to lose their viscosity.
    For metals, tin is the most common cementing material. Many metal utensils and industrial metal equipment are mostly welded with tin. However, tin is very afraid of cold. It gradually turns into powdery gray tin below minus eighteen degrees Celsius and loses its bonding effect.
    People also use synthetic resins to glue wooden boards and canvas into laminates and plywood. However, although these resins have a strong ability to glue wood and cotton cloth, they are not quite the same for other substances, and these resins are not very convenient to use.
    Whether it is natural animal glue, plant glue, metal tin, or synthetic resin, none of them are satisfactory: either they are not resistant to water or organic solvents, or they are not resistant to low temperatures; either their bonding ability is not strong, or they can only bond the same materials and cannot bond two substances with different properties.
    People are constantly looking for new adhesives, adhesives that are not only afraid of cold and heat, but also not afraid of water and microorganisms...; that can not only bond metal, porcelain, glass, plastic, rubber, and leather, but even bond stones together—the universal glue.
    The universal glue must be a substance whose molecules have good "feelings" for various solids, but no "feelings" for water and other solvents. In 1936, the Soviet chemist Nazarov finally developed this universal glue. It is a universal glue synthesized from acetylene compounds and ketone compounds.
    The universal glue is not afraid of water and microorganisms, nor is it afraid of cold, and can maintain its bonding ability between minus sixty degrees Celsius and plus sixty degrees Celsius.
    Someone once conducted such an interesting experiment: gluing broken aluminum sheets into an aluminum plate with universal glue. Then the aluminum plate was pressed into a dish with a machine. Even after such a large machine pressure, there were no cracks in the glued area. This property is of particular importance to aluminum, because aluminum sheets cannot be joined together by welding. For other things, the bonding ability of universal glue is also so great; if you want to break the glued things again, the breaking point is not the original joint, but other parts of the glued object.
    Universal glue can also replace cement. When building bridges and houses, you only need to pile up stones of appropriate sizes and then glue them together with universal glue. The marble walls of the Moscow subway station are glued together with universal glue, which is both beautiful and strong.
    The outer shell of a storage battery is always made of acid-resistant material and contains concentrated sulfuric acid. In the past, if this shell broke, it could no longer be used. But now you can use acid-resistant universal glue to re-glue it.
    Universal glue also brings convenience to our daily life. Children's toys, porcelain, pottery, metal utensils, etc. can be re-glued with this glue when they are broken.

　　万能的胶
　　夏露
    煮烂的面粉，米粉和各种动物胶都有粘性，我们也常利用它们的这种粘性来胶木材、棉布、纸张……。可是这些胶大都怕水，一碰到水，就减低了粘性。同时也怕许多微生物，因为微生物能够慢慢地使它们失去粘性。
    对于金属来说，白锡要算是最普通的胶合物质了。许多金属器皿、工业上的许多金属器材，大都是用白锡来焊接的。但是白锡很怕冷，它在摄氏零下十八度以下就渐渐变为粉末状的灰锡而失去胶合作用。
    人们还用人工合成的树脂把木板、帆布胶合成层压板和胶合板。可是，虽然这些树脂对于木材、棉布的胶合能力很强，但是对于其他的物质就不完全这样，同时这些树脂使用起来也不很方便。
    无论是天然的动物胶、植物胶、金属锡或是人工合成的树胶，都不能令人满意：不是不能耐水或有机溶剂，就是不能耐低温；不是胶合能力不强，就是只能胶合相同的物质而不能胶合两种性质不同的物质。
    人们不断地寻求新的胶粘剂，要这种胶粘剂不仅不怕冷和热，也不怕水和微生物……；不仅能够胶合金属、瓷器、玻璃、塑料、橡胶和皮革，甚至能够把石头粘在一起——万能的胶。
    万能胶必须是这样一种物质：它的分子对各种固体的“感情”都很好，但是对水和其他的溶剂却没有“感情”。1936年，苏联化学家纳扎罗夫终于研究出了这种万能胶。它是由乙炔的化合物和酮类化合物合成的万能胶。
    万能胶不怕水和微生物，也不怕冷，在摄氏零下六十度到零上六十度之间都能保持它的胶合能力。
    有人曾作过这样一个有趣的实验：把碎的铝片用万能胶粘成一张铝板。然后把这铝板用机器压成一个碟，虽然经过这么大的机器压力，那用胶胶合的地方丝毫没有裂痕。这种性质对于铝来说，更有特别重要的意义，因为要想把铝片接在一起是不能用焊接的方法的。对于其他的东西来说，万能胶的胶合能力也是如此的大；如果想把已经胶合起来的东西重新弄断，折断的地方不是原来的接缝处，而是胶接物的其他地方。
    万能胶还可以代替水泥。建筑桥梁和房屋时，只要把大小合适的石块堆在一起，然后用万能胶粘起来就可以了。莫斯科地下火车站中大理石的墙壁就是用万能胶胶起来的，既美观，又结实。
    蓄电池的外壳，总是用耐酸的材料制成的，里面盛着浓硫酸。在过去，要是这个壳破裂后，就无法再用了。可是现在可以用不怕酸腐蚀的万能胶把它重新胶合起来。
    万能胶在日常生活中也给我们带来了方便，儿童的玩具、瓷器、陶器、金属器皿等破裂时都可以用这种胶把它们重新胶合起来。
