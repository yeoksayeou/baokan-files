    Taiyuan Builds Mineral Wool Factory
    China's first mineral wool factory recently began construction in Taiyuan and is expected to officially begin production in April of next year.
    Slag wool has similar properties to asbestos. It can insulate, soundproof, coldproof, heatproof, and dampproof, making it a needed material for the construction industry; it is especially needed for the construction of steel plants, power plants, and food factories. It is lower in price and easier to produce than asbestos.
    This mineral wool factory is being built near the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, using waste slag and broken bricks from the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant as raw materials. According to the design capacity, it can produce 20,000 tons of slag wool annually. These products will not only meet the needs of Shanxi Province, but can also supply the Northwest and other regions.

    太原兴建矿棉厂
    我国第一座矿棉厂最近在太原动工兴建，预计明年4月正式投入生产。
    矿渣棉的性能同石棉类似，可以保温、隔音、隔冷、隔热、隔潮，是建筑工业上需要的一种材料；特别是建筑钢铁厂、发电厂和食品工厂更为需要。它比石棉的价格低，而且容易生产。
    这个矿棉厂建设在太原钢铁厂附近，利用太原钢铁厂的废炉渣和碎砖块作原料。按照设计能力，它每年可以生产两万吨矿渣棉。这些产品不仅能满足山西省的需要，而且还可以供应西北等地。
