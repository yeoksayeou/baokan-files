    On May 1st of this year, the people-run film team, which was established on a trial basis in our Red Star Agricultural Cooperative by the Film Bureau of the Ministry of Culture, was born. All of the members of our cooperative joyfully celebrated having our own film team. Now, our film team has already started working, touring to various villages every day to show films. Many elderly people in their sixties and seventies, and women who cannot leave their homes due to family matters, have seen movies. Everyone praises the good leadership of the Party and praises the superiority of the cooperative road.
    We are all farmers who have grown up in the countryside and worked diligently for decades. In the past, not to mention watching movies, we didn't even know what movies were all about. Now, having turned over and embarked on the road of collectivization, our lives have improved. In addition to labor, we need cultural life, and the Party has established a film team for us. As the saying goes, "Nothing is closer than parents." We say, "The Communist Party is even closer to us working people than our parents."
    The unprecedented people-run film team in Chinese history has begun in our Red Star Agricultural Cooperative. We feel boundless honor and joy. The members have put forward that, in order to thank the Party for its meticulous care for us, we are determined to do a good job in the great leap forward in production in 1958. All our cadres, in addition to doing a good job in production, are determined to work with the projectionists to make a success of the film team's pilot project, so that fraternal cooperatives across the country can learn from our experiences and lessons and smoothly establish their own film teams, allowing peasant brothers across the country to see more movies like us.

　　我们社有了电影放映队
　　昌黎县赤洋口乡红星农业社  邹继田　井春盛  常承绪　刘荣升
    今年5月1日，文化部电影事业管理局在我们红星农业社试办的民办电影队诞生了。我们全社的社员，都欢天喜地的庆祝自己有了电影队。现在，我们的电影队已经开始工作了，每天到各村去巡回映出，很多六、七十岁的老人和因家庭琐事不能出门的妇女都看到了电影，人人都称赞党的领导好，赞美合作化的道路优越。
    我们都是从小就生长在农村、辛勤劳动了几十年的农民，过去不要说看电影，就是连电影是怎么回事都不知道。现在，翻了身，走上了合作化的道路，生活提高了，除了劳动之外，需要有文化生活，党就给我们建立了电影队，俗话说：“最亲不过爹娘”。我们说：“共产党对我们劳动人民，比爹娘还亲。”
    在中国历史上前所未有的民办电影队，在我们红星农业社开始了，我们感到无上的光荣和喜悦，社员们纷纷提出，为了感谢党对我们无微不至的关怀，决心搞好1958年生产大跃进，我们全体干部、除了搞好生产外，还要决心和放映员一道把放映队的试点搞好，好让全国各兄弟社，吸取我们的经验教训，顺利地办起自己的电影队来，让全国的农民兄弟，和我们一样更多地看到电影。
