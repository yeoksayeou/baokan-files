Changchun Municipal Party Committee Leading Cadres
　　Persist in Studying Theory for Two Years Without Interruption
    Secretary Takes the Lead, Personally Directs, Connects with Thinking, Integrates with Reality
    (Our Dispatch) Leading cadres of the Changchun Municipal Party Committee have persisted in theoretical study for two years without interruption. These leading cadres organized study groups in the spring of 1956, including the Municipal Party Committee Secretary, Standing Committee members, and ministers of various departments, totaling twenty-one people. They regularly engaged in collective study once a week (with a period in between where it was twice a week), holding discussions or reading documents. Even during the busiest period of the rectification movement last year, few people requested leave, except for individual members who went to Beijing or the Provincial Party Committee for meetings. The vast majority of comrades have developed the habit of studying on time.
    The reason why the leading cadres of the Changchun Municipal Party Committee can persist in theoretical study for a long time is primarily because their study is combined with the current situation and tasks, and with major issues in their work and in the thinking of cadres. For example, when they studied dialectical materialism last spring, they did not start from existing philosophy textbooks, but focused on studying the relationships between industry and agriculture, heavy industry and light industry, consumption and accumulation, etc., in China's socialist construction. The study and understanding of these issues further deepened their comprehension of the law of unity of opposites in real life. During the anti-Rightist struggle, when examining the right-leaning thoughts in the political and legal departments, they combined their work with the study of works such as "The State and Revolution" and "The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky." Studying with such a purpose not only improved their understanding but also promoted their work. In addition, they set aside time to study major documents of the past two years, such as "On the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, "More on the Historical Experience of the Proletarian Dictatorship," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and the two declarations of the Moscow Conference.
    The reason why Changchun's leading cadres have persisted in theoretical study for a long time also lies in the fact that the secretary took the lead and personally directed it. Several secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee (first and foremost the First Secretary) are active members of the study group; one of the secretaries is the leader of this study group. They regard doing a good job in the theoretical study of leading cadres as one of the most important political and ideological tasks, and mainly propose what to study and what to solve based on the problems existing in the cadres' work and thinking. Behind this study group is a Secretariat meeting, and the content of their study is often proposed by the Secretariat meeting. If the Secretariat finds any problems in the thinking or work of the comrades participating in the study group, it will propose that they be discussed at the Wednesday study session. For example, after listening to Chairman Mao's report on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" last spring, there were different understandings, such as on the issue of cracking down on criminal offenders. Initially, the understanding among cadres was not consistent either. All of these were unified through theoretical study. They believe that to do a good job, it is necessary to unify thinking; otherwise, it will be impossible to draw the bow.
    At the beginning of each new study period, the study group formulates a plan, determines how to study, what problems to solve, which centers to focus on, how many discussions to hold, and how long to study. Sometimes, they also draft several topics, determine the main speaker and the supplementary speaker. Necessary study systems are also stipulated to ensure study time. Therefore, their theoretical study is often persisted in; and because it is connected with reality, everyone grasps more information, the content of the study is richer, and it is also lively and enthusiastic, able to unfold debates, so that everyone feels that they have gained something. The year before last, after these cadres studied the "Eighth National Congress" documents, they also gave reports to cadres throughout the city, some twice, and some seven or eight times. It also played a role in promoting the study of cadres throughout the city.
    Now, in accordance with the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee, and in order to adapt to the current strengthening of the theoretical ranks and the needs of cadres to carry out study, the Changchun Municipal Party Committee is brewing to bring the theoretical study of leading cadres to a new stage.

    长春市委领导干部
　　坚持学理论两年未间断
    书记带头　亲自领导　联系思想　结合实际
    本报讯　中共长春市委领导干部两年来坚持理论学习，从未间断。这些领导干部从1956年春季组织学习小组，其中包括市委书记、常委及各部部长等共二十一人，每周定期集体学习一次（中间有一段时间每周两次）开讨论会或阅读文件。即使在去年整风运动最繁忙的时期，除个别成员因去北京或省委开会，很少有人请假，绝大多数同志已养成按时学习的习惯。
    长春市委领导干部能长期坚持理论学习，首先在于他们的学习是结合当前形势和任务，结合工作和干部思想上的重大问题进行的。比如去年春天他们学习唯物辩证法时，不是从已有的哲学教科书出发，而是着重学习了当前我国社会主义建设中的工业与农业，重工业与轻工业，消费与积累等关系问题。这些问题的研究和体会，进一步理解现实生活中的矛盾统一的规律。在反右派斗争中，在检查政法部门右倾思想时，他们又结合工作学习了“国家与革命”、“无产阶级革命和叛徒考茨基”等著作。这样有目的地读书，既提高了认识，又推动了工作。此外，对近两年的重大文件，如“关于无产阶级专政的历史经验”、中共第八次全国代表大会文件、“再论无产阶级专政的历史经验”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”以及莫斯科会议的两个宣言等，他们都划出一段时间来进行学习。
    长春市领导干部之所以长期坚持了理论学习，还在于书记带头亲自领导。市委的几位书记（首先是第一书记）都是学习的积极分子；其中一位书记是这个学习小组的组长。他们把搞好领导干部理论学习当作一项最重要的政治思想工作，主要根据干部在工作上，思想上存在的问题提出学什么，解决什么。这个学习小组的背后有个书记处会议，他们学习的内容往往是书记处会议提出来的。书记处发现参加学习小组的同志思想上，工作上存在什么问题，就提出来在星期三的学习会上谈谈。像去年春季听了毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的传达报告后，就有不同的理解如对打击刑事犯罪分子问题，最初，干部中的认识也不一致。这些，都通过理论学习，统一了思想。他们认为想做好工作就要统一思想，否则拉不开弓。
    每一段新的学习开始，学习小组都订出计划，确定怎样学法，要解决什么问题，抓哪几个中心，讨论几次，学多长时间。有时还拟定几个专题，确定主要发言人、补充发言人。并规定了必要的学习制度，保证学习时间。因此，他们的理论学习就经常坚持下来；而且由于联系实际，大家掌握的情况多，学习的内容就比较充实，同时也学习得活泼、热烈，能展开争论，使大家都感到有所收获。前年，这些干部学了“八大”文件以后，还向全市干部做了报告，少的两次，多的七、八次。对全市的干部学习也起了推动作用。
    现在，中共长春市委根据党中央最近的指示，为适应当前加强理论队伍，适应干部开展学习的需要，正酝酿使领导干部的理论学习踏上一个新的阶段。　（李德天）
