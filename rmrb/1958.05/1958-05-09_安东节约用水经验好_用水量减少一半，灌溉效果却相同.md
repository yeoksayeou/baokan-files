    Andong's Experience in Water Conservation is Good
    Water Usage Halved, Yet Irrigation Effect Remains the Same
    (Our Newspaper dispatch) Andong County farmers in Liaoning Province have broken with convention and are promoting water conservation methods, resolving the contradiction of doubled paddy fields despite water sources being halved due to drought.
    Andong County farmers have proposed dozens of rational irrigation methods, the main ones being: Continuous day and night watering, shortening the paddy soaking period from the past thirteen days to seven days, thus reducing water evaporation and seepage by half; irrigating high-lying fields first, then low-lying fields, allowing the water seeping from the high-lying fields to moisten the low-lying fields, reducing water usage in the low-lying fields; blocking drainage ditches during the paddy soaking period, keeping the water level in the drainage ditches balanced with the water level in the fields, reducing the seepage of field water into the ditches; and shallow irrigation of alternating rows, allowing the water in the irrigated fields to moisten the unirrigated fields, so that the water that originally belonged to seepage also plays a role. Using these methods, 2,400 cubic meters of water can irrigate one hectare of land, achieving basically the same effect as last year when 5,000 cubic meters of water were used to irrigate one hectare.
    Andong County has struggled against various conservative ideas while promoting these rational irrigation methods. For example, on the issue of blocking drainage ditches, some people followed the clichés in books, believing that blocking the ditches would raise the water table, causing salinization and marshification of the paddy fields. However, after debate and field experiments, it was proven that under drought conditions, such consequences did not occur. Some people said that lowering water quotas would lead to reduced production, but the facts in the Helong Irrigation District refuted this claim. Due to the continuous improvement of the masses' technical level and the implementation of water-saving measures, the Helong Irrigation District, from 1949 to 1957, with unchanged water source conditions, expanded its irrigation area from 300 hectares to 1,900 hectares, with irrigation water being halved year by year, but yields increased substantially year by year.

### 安东节约用水经验好  用水量减少一半，灌溉效果却相同

    安东节约用水经验好
    用水量减少一半，灌溉效果却相同
    本报讯　辽宁省安东县农民打破常规，推行节约用水经验，解决了水田倍增而水源却因天旱减半的矛盾。
    安东县农民提出的合理灌溉方法有几十种，其中主要的有：昼夜连续放水，泡田期由过去十三天缩短为七天，水的蒸发渗漏量因此减少一半；先灌高田后灌低田，让高田渗漏的水润湿低田，使低田减少用水量；在泡田期堵截排水沟，使排水沟水位和田里的水位保持平衡，减少田水随沟下渗；隔畦浅灌，让受灌田里的水浸润没灌的田，让原来属于渗漏部分的水也发挥作用。采用这些办法，用二千四百公方水就可以灌田一公顷，和去年用五千公方水灌田一公顷的效果基本一样。
    安东县在推广这些合理灌溉方法时，和各种保守思想进行了斗争。比如堵截排水沟问题，有些人就沿习书本上的陈规戒律，认为一堵就会提高地下水位，造成稻田盐碱化、沼泽化。但是经过辩论和实地试验，证明在天旱的条件下并不产生这样的后果。有人说降低用水定额就会引起减产，但是合隆灌区的事实却驳倒了这种说法。由于群众技术水平不断提高和推行节约用水措施，合隆灌区从1949年到1957年，水源条件没变，灌溉面积由三百公顷扩大到一千九百公顷，灌溉用水逐年减半，但产量却逐年大幅度上升。
