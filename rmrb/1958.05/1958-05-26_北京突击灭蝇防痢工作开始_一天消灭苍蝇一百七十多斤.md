Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: The people of the capital today launched a large-scale campaign to promote "dysentery prevention and fly elimination."

In the urban area, over one hundred fixed propaganda stations are using pictures, charts, models, and microscopic/magnifying glass observations to educate citizens on methods for preventing dysentery and the dangers of flies. Mobile propaganda teams from various street committees are conducting door-to-door campaigns in the streets and alleys. Over two thousand medical personnel went to various propaganda stations to give lectures to citizens on dysentery prevention and fly elimination.

Many performing arts groups actively participated in today's promotional activities. More than ten performing arts groups, including the Beijing People's Art Theatre, the China Youth Art Theatre, and the China Pingju Theatre, performed brilliant programs on the streets to cooperate with the dysentery prevention and fly elimination campaign.

The 24th to the 26th are Beijing's city-wide emergency fly swatting activity days. During these two days, everywhere you can see groups of people with fly swatters hunting down flies. Many residents are using fish heads, chives, and other things to attract flies, and then swatting at them. On the 24th alone, 330,000 workers, Young Pioneers, and street residents in the eight districts of the city and suburbs eliminated more than 170 jin of flies. Cadres in government offices are also using their spare time to participate in fly swatting activities.

    据新华社25日讯　首都人民今天大规模地宣传“防痢灭蝇”。
    在城区有一百多处固定宣传站用画片、图表、模型以及显微镜、放大镜观察等方法，向市民们宣传防治痢疾的方法和苍蝇的危害。各街道办事处的流动宣传队在大街小巷挨门挨户进行宣传。两千多医务人员到各个宣传站向市民作了防痢灭蝇的宣传讲演。
    许多文艺团体积极参加了今天的宣传活动。北京人民艺术剧院、中国青年艺术剧院、中国评剧院等十多个文艺团体都上街演出精彩节目，配合防痢灭蝇的宣传。
    24日到26日是北京全市突击灭蝇的活动日。这两天，到处可以看到拿蝇拍搜捕苍蝇的人群。许多居民用鱼头、韭菜等诱引苍蝇，进行捕打。24日一天，城郊八个区的三十三万职工、少先队员和街道居民等共灭蝇一百七十多斤。机关干部也利用业余时间参加灭蝇活动。
