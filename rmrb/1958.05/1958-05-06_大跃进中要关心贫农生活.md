    In the Great Leap Forward, Care Should Be Taken for the Lives of Poor Peasants
    卓康宁[Zhuo Kangning]

    The all-round leap forward in socialist agricultural production must rely closely on the broad masses of peasants. The masses usually have three parts: advanced, middle, and backward. Poor and lower-middle peasants are the main body of the advanced masses. In the past, we relied on them to successfully complete agricultural cooperativization, and now we mainly rely on them to set off a high tide of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Ideological surveys of many agricultural cooperatives have proved that poor peasants are the most supportive of the Great Leap Forward in production, because they can only get rid of poverty by developing collective production. In the Daxing No. 1 Cooperative in Changsha County, Hunan, 52 out of 53 poor peasant households actively supported the Great Leap Forward production measures, and 47 of them were not afraid of any difficulties and were full of energy. The active elements of other classes are not as large. Generally speaking, poor peasants are the most active in labor within the cooperative, the most concerned about the affairs of the cooperative, not superficially compliant, but wholeheartedly, earnestly, and full of confidence and determination in the Great Leap Forward in production. This enthusiasm is extremely valuable and is a guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.
    However, some of them still have some temporary practical difficulties in participating in collective production and operating small-scale household sideline occupations, and rural work comrades need to care for them and help them overcome these difficulties in order to better encourage the advanced and promote their leading role. The Gantang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongwushan Township, Ningxiang County, has 160 households in total, and there are still more than 40 poor peasant households. About one-third of them have encountered the following difficulties: some lack the necessary tools, farm implements, and rain gear; some have family labor or other members who are sick; some have household pig-raising sideline occupations affected by disease or lack of funds to develop household sideline occupations, and so on. Yu Mingqiu, a member of the sixth production team, had six family members, and two pigs died of illness in December last year, and his wife was also sick. Although he has been actively working since the beginning of this year, he is not happy, and he has no money to buy a rake for turning manure pits, and he cannot complete the task assigned to him by the production team to turn pits, and can only participate in weeding. Huang Juchu, a member of the third team, has six family members. Last year, because of illness, he did not earn many workdays and did not receive food rations. This year, he has no money to buy grain from the cooperative. The sow he is raising at home is pregnant and will soon give birth to piglets, but he wants to sell the sow because of insufficient feed. There are 17 households with similar situations (to varying degrees), accounting for nearly one-tenth of the total number of households in the cooperative. Due to the above reasons, these households have worked one or twenty days less than the average cooperative member since this spring. The cooperative cadres discovered this situation and have taken emergency measures to help them separately. Some have advanced part of their household fertilizer investment, some have borrowed part of their feed, and some have helped solve the problem of piglets. In addition, the cooperative has also uniformly purchased seventeen hoes, seven rakes, two hundred and fifty loads of baskets, and more than sixty pieces of rain gear, and lent them to poor cooperative members in advance. According to a survey in Wulidui Township, Ningxiang County, among the 20 agricultural cooperatives in the township, more than 980 households had overspent during the final settlement last year. Among them, 341 households overspent due to having many people but little labor, loss of labor, or less work due to illness, accounting for nearly one-third of the total number of overspent households. These households have not developed household sideline occupations well this year, and still do not work much in the cooperative. The Lianhuaping Cooperative in Taojiang County reported that since the Great Leap Forward, cooperative members have rarely engaged in individual sideline occupations, and the intensity of labor has generally increased, so some cooperative members have encountered some difficulties in their lives. This is a problem worth noting.
    Since most agricultural cooperatives have only been established for about two years, it is not surprising that some agricultural cooperatives still have a small number of poor cooperative members. This problem can only be gradually solved with the development of agricultural cooperative production. However, the problem now is that some comrades engaged in rural work have neglected this problem. Some comrades believe that "since we are organizing the Great Leap Forward in production, how can we take care of the difficulties of individual households?" They do not understand that cooperative members who still have some difficulties are often the core of the advanced masses—the poor peasants. When they still have a little strength to overcome difficulties themselves, they will not ask the cadres for help. They see that the collective cause of the cooperative still has difficulties, so they are unwilling to raise personal difficulties. If the leadership cannot understand this feeling and cannot actively help them solve practical difficulties, the enthusiasm of these poor peasant masses will be affected. The experience of the Gantang Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County in solving the difficulties of poor peasants and caring for their lives, mentioned earlier, is worth promoting. It is hoped that agricultural cooperatives in various places will pay attention to it.
    I believe that rural work comrades in various places should attach importance to this matter ideologically. While organizing mass labor, they should often understand their ideological and living conditions so as to solve some of their practical difficulties in a timely manner. Some cooperative members who are poor peasants work fewer days than the average cooperative member, which may reduce their income after the autumn harvest. For these households, in addition to taking care of them in terms of labor production division, they should also support their legitimate household sideline occupations and help them solve the problems of insufficient small farm implements, tools, rain gear, and the necessary daily pocket money for work. The management of cooperative members' private plots should also be properly arranged on the premise of being conducive to the development of collective production.

### 大跃进中要关心贫农生活

    大跃进中要关心贫农生活
    卓康宁
    社会主义农业生产的全面跃进，必须紧紧依靠广大农民群众。群众中通常有先进、中间、后进三个部分。贫农和下中农是先进群众的主体。从前，我们依靠他们顺利完成了农业合作化，现在又主要是依靠他们掀起农业生产大跃进的高潮。许多农业社的思想情况调查证明，贫农是最拥护生产大跃进的，因为他们只有靠发展集体生产，才能摆脱贫困。湖南长沙县大兴一社贫农五十三户，积极拥护大跃进生产措施的有五十二户，其中不怕任何困难、干劲很足的有四十七户。其他阶层的积极部分就没有这么大。一般说来，贫农在社内劳动最积极，对社内事情最关心，不是阳奉阴违，而是一心一意，一本正经，对生产大跃进充满信心和决心。这种热情极为宝贵，是农业生产大跃进的保证。
    但是，他们中间有些人在参加集体生产和经营家庭小型副业等方面都还有一些暂时性的实际困难，需要农村工作的同志加以关心，帮助他们克服，以便更好地鼓励先进，发扬他们的带头作用。宁乡县东骛山乡甘棠农业社全社一百六十户，现在贫农还有四十多户。他们中间约有三分之一的人曾经发生这样一些困难：有的是缺乏必需的工具、农具和雨具，有的是家庭劳动力或其他成员有病，有的是家庭养猪副业受到病疫影响，或缺乏资金开展家庭副业等等。第六生产队社员余明秋全家六口人，去年12月病死了两头猪，妻子又有病。今年以来虽然经常积极出工，但心情总不愉快，没有钱购买自带的翻粪氹用的耙头，生产队分配给他翻氹的任务不能完成，只能参加锄草皮的农活。三队社员黄菊初，六口人，去年因为有病，做的劳动日不多，没有分回口粮，今年又没有钱向社内买粮，家里喂的一头母猪已经怀孕，快要产小猪了，但因饲料不足，便想将母猪卖掉。类似这样情况（程度不同）的有十七户，占全社总户数近十分之一。这些户因为以上各种原因，今年春季以来比一般社员少出工一、二十天。社干部发现了这一情况，已经采取了紧急措施，分别给以帮助。有的是提前预支了一部分家肥投资，有的是借支了一部分饲料，有的是帮助解决了仔猪困难。另外，社里还统一购买了十七把锄头，七把耙头，二百五十担箢箕，六十多件雨具，分别预借给贫困社员。又据宁乡县五里堆乡的调查，全乡二十个农业社，去年分配决算时有九百八十多户超支户，其中因为人多劳力少，丧失劳力或因有病而出工较少，造成超支的有三百四十一户，几占超支户总数的三分之一。这些户今年家庭副业开展的不好，在社内出工仍不太多。桃江县莲花坪社反映，大跃进以来，社员很少搞个人副业，而劳动强度一般都增加了，因此一部分社员生活发生一些困难。这是一个值得注意的问题。
    由于大部分农业社还只办了二年左右，有些农业社还有少数贫困社员，并不稀奇。这问题也只能随着农业社生产的发展而逐步解决。但是，现在的问题是有些从事农村工作的同志忽视了这个问题，有的同志认为“既然组织生产大跃进，那里还顾得上管个别农户的困难？”他们不了解现在还有某些困难的社员往往是先进群众中的核心——贫农。当他们还有一点点力量自己克服困难的时候，他们是不会向干部提出困难的。他们看到社的集体事业还有困难，因而不愿意提出个人的困难。如果领导上不能理解这种心情，不能主动地帮助他们解决实际困难，这些贫农群众的积极性是会受到影响的。前面谈到的宁乡县甘棠农业社解决贫农困难、关心贫农生活的经验，值得推广。希望各地农业社都注意起来。
    我认为各地农村工作同志应当从思想上重视这件事情。在组织群众劳动的同时，要经常了解他们的思想情况和生活情况，以便及时解决他们的某些实际困难。有些社贫农社员出工少于一般社员，这就有可能在秋后减少收入。对于这些户，除了从劳动生产分工上加以照顾外，还应该扶植他们正当的家庭副业，帮助他们解决出工所需小农具、工具、雨具不足，以及日常必要零用钱的问题。对于社员自留地的经营，也应该在有利于发展集体生产的前提下进行适当的安排。
