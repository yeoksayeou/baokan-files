Bukittinggi is located in the mountains of West Sumatra. The urban area is not large and undulates along the mountains. In Indonesian, "Bukittinggi" means "highland." The scenery is beautiful and the climate is cool.

Bukittinggi is the capital of the West Sumatra Autonomous Region and an important transportation hub connecting North and South Sumatra. Railways and highways intersect here. It is 98 kilometers southwest of Padang and more than 700 kilometers northeast of Medan, the largest city in Sumatra. With a population of about 100,000, it is strategically important.

The name of Bukittinggi occupies a glorious position in the history of Indonesia's national independence struggle. In the 19th century struggle against Dutch colonists, the people in the Bukittinggi area, under the leadership of the national hero Tuanku Imam Bonjol, fought stubbornly for sixteen years. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, the people of Bukittinggi carried out a heroic resistance against the Japanese occupying forces.

After the end of World War II, in December 1948, Bukittinggi was attacked by the Dutch colonial army, which attempted to make a comeback. The people of Bukittinggi responded to the invaders with a scorched-earth policy, guerrilla warfare, and street fighting. During this period of struggle, the Republic of Indonesia once designated Bukittinggi as its provisional capital. Due to the heroic struggle of the Indonesian people and the support of the people of the world, the Netherlands had to accept a ceasefire and withdraw its troops from Bukittinggi.

In recent years, reactionary forces within Indonesia, under the direction of imperialism, have tried to subvert the young Republic of Indonesia. In December 1956, the rebel Hussein group openly launched a military coup in Bukittinggi, implementing separatist rule. In February of this year, rebels gathered from all over to Bukittinggi and announced the establishment of a self-proclaimed "revolutionary government." They vainly attempted to use the Bukittinggi area as their base.

The people of Sumatra and Bukittinggi, who have a glorious tradition of struggle, fiercely oppose the traitorous acts of the rebels. In early 1957, various parties and people's organizations in Central Sumatra held a meeting in Bukittinggi. The meeting expressed its lack of support for the fascist military group headed by Hussein, the "Wild Bull Division Committee." On August 21 last year, the people of Bukittinggi held a large demonstration against the illegal rule of the "Wild Bull Division Committee," and the rebels arrested the leaders of the demonstration.

Bukittinggi is also a famous cultural city in Sumatra. There are famous cultural relics museums and zoos here. The city's ethnic-style buildings and special handicrafts often leave a deep and unforgettable impression on visitors.

    武吉丁宜
    武吉丁宜座落在西苏门答腊的群山之中。市区面积不大，依山起伏。在印度尼西亚文中，“武吉丁宜”就是“高原”的意思。这里风景优美，气候凉爽。
    武吉丁宜是西苏门答腊自治区的首府和全苏门答腊南北交通的重要枢纽，铁路和公路在此交集。它西南距巴东九十八公里，东北距苏门答腊最大的城市棉兰七百余公里。人口约十万，在战略上居于要冲。
    武吉丁宜的名字在印度尼西亚民族独立斗争历史上占有光辉的位置。在十九世纪反抗荷兰殖民者的斗争中，武吉丁宜附近地区的人民在民族英雄端古·伊曼·本佐尔的领导下，进行了历时十六年的顽强战斗。在日本侵略军占领印度尼西亚期间，武吉丁宜人民对日本占领军又进行了英勇的反抗。
    第二次世界大战结束以后，1948年12月，武吉丁宜遭到妄图卷土重来的荷兰殖民军的袭击。武吉丁宜人民用焦土政策、游击战和巷战来回答侵略者。在这段斗争期间，印度尼西亚共和国曾经把武吉丁宜定为陪都。由于印度尼西亚人民的英勇斗争和世界人民的支援，荷兰不得不接受停战，并撤出它在武吉丁宜的军队。
    近年以来，印度尼西亚国内的反动势力，在帝国主义的指使下，力图颠覆年轻的印度尼西亚共和国。1956年12月，叛乱分子侯赛尼集团公然在武吉丁宜发动军事政变，实行分裂割据，今年2月，从各地聚集到这里来的叛乱分子又在武吉丁宜宣布成立自封的“革命政府”。他们妄想把武吉丁宜地区作为他们盘踞的基地。
    有着光荣斗争传统的苏门答腊和武吉丁宜的人民，激烈反对叛乱分子的卖国行为。1957年年初，中苏门答腊各党派、各人民团体在武吉丁宜举行会议，会议表示不支持以侯赛尼为首的法西斯军事集团
  “雄牛师委员会”。去年8月21日，武吉丁宜人民又举行反对“雄牛师委员会”非法统治的大示威，叛乱分子们逮捕了示威的领导者。
    武吉丁宜还是苏门答腊有名的文化城。这里有著名的文物馆和动物园。市内富有民族风格的建筑物和特种手工艺品，经常使来到这里的人，留下深刻难忘的印象。
