Four million farmers in Zhejiang Province are fighting against the plum rain flood.

Zhejiang Province has entered the low-temperature, rainy plum rain season, which poses a great threat to spring-harvested crops such as wheat, barley, peas, and rapeseed that are about to be harvested, and summer-harvested crops that have just been planted. Now, four million farmers and cadres across the province are rising up to prevent waterlogging and drain water, fighting against the plum rain.

From April 30th to May 5th, the province experienced torrential rain from north to south. Rainfall in many areas exceeded 100 millimeters. This coincided with the spring tide season, causing rivers to rise. The upper reaches of the Qiantang River, Puyang River, Cao'e River, and Oujiang River once exceeded or approached the warning water level, and low-lying fields in some areas were flooded.

In the Jinhua Special District, nearly 7,000 cadres and more than 100,000 agricultural cooperative members are rushing to harvest wheat on the one hand, and opening ditches to drain water in rice paddies and rice seedling fields on the other. Farmers in Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other special districts are using pumps, waterwheels, and other drainage tools to drain water. More than 30,000 mu of summer-harvested crops in Yuyao County that were flooded have been rescued by pumping water and have had standing water removed in a timely manner. Zhuji County has adopted the method of "drain one field, plant one field," immediately transplanting early rice seedlings.

Before this heavy rain, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China had already made arrangements for flood and waterlogging prevention throughout the province. Now, flood and drought prevention organizations have been established from top to bottom throughout the province, determined to overcome spring floods and waterlogging disasters and ensure the realization of agricultural production increase plans.

    浙江四百万农民和霉雨大水斗争
    浙江省已进入低温多雨的霉雨季节，这对即将收割的小麦、大麦、豌豆、油菜等春花作物和刚刚插播下去的夏收作物威胁很大。现在全省有四百万农民和干部正在奋起防涝排水，同霉雨作斗争。
    自4月30日到5月5日，全省从北而南大雨倾盆，不少地区降雨量在一百公厘以上，又值大潮汛时期，河流涨水，钱塘江、浦阳江、曹娥江上游和瓯江上游曾一度超过或接近警戒水位，部分地区的低洼田地被淹。
    金华专区有近七千个干部和十多万农业社社员一面抢收麦子，一面在水稻田和稻秧田里开沟排水。嘉兴、宁波等专区农民纷纷用抽水机、水车和其他排水工具排水。余姚县受淹的三万多亩夏收作物经抽水抢救，已及时排除渍水。诸暨县采取“排一丘，种一丘”，把早稻秧立即插上。
    这次大雨前，中共浙江省委就向全省作了防涝抗涝布置。现在全省从上到下都已成立了防汛防旱机构，决心战胜春洪和涝害，确保农业增产计划的实现。
