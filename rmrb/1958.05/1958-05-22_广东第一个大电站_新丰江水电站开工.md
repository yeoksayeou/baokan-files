    Guangdong's First Large Power Station
    Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station Begins Construction

    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 21st. The Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station in Guangdong has started construction ahead of schedule in mid-May.

    The designed power generation capacity of this hydropower station is 290,000 kilowatts, the same as the Huanren Hydropower Station in the Hunjiang River basin of eastern Liaoning, which recently started construction. After its completion, it will provide inexpensive electricity to the area within a 250-kilometer radius centered on it, and in particular, it will meet the electricity needs of industrial and agricultural development in Guangzhou, northern Guangdong, and eastern Guangdong. Its large reservoir will play a huge role in flood control, reducing flood disasters in the Dongjiang River, increasing grain production by 180 million jin per year on 600,000 mu of paddy fields, and producing 200,000 dan of fresh fish per year by raising fish in the reservoir.

    The construction project of this hydropower station is very large, with a total reservoir capacity of 11.5 billion cubic meters, larger than the reservoir of the Huanren Hydropower Station. Currently, thousands of workers are working intensively on the construction of site roads, houses, and other projects, and various construction machinery and large amounts of steel are being continuously transported to the construction site.

    广东第一个大电站
    新丰江水电站开工
    新华社广州21日电　广东新丰江水电站已经提前在5月中旬动工兴建。
    这个水电站的设计发电能力为二十九万瓩，同最近动工兴建的辽东浑江流域的桓仁水电站一样。它建成后，将使以它为中心的二百五十公里半径范围内的地区得到廉价的电力供应，特别是可以满足广州和粤北、粤东等地区工农业发展的用电需要。它的大水库将起巨大的防洪作用，能减轻东江的洪水灾害，使六十万亩稻田每年增产一亿八千万斤粮食，利用水库养鱼，每年还可以出产二十万担鲜鱼。
    这个水电站的建设工程十分浩大，水库的总容积将达到一百一十五亿立方公尺。比桓仁水电站水库的容积大。现在，千百名工人正在紧张地修筑工地公路、房屋等工程，各种施工机械和大量钢材正在源源地运往工地。
