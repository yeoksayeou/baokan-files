Copenhagen News: The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Foreign Ministers' meeting concluded in Copenhagen on the 7th. Judging from the communiqué issued after the meeting, US Secretary of State Dulles's manipulation of the group has failed. Dulles's stubborn obstruction of East-West talks during the three-day meeting did not achieve the anticipated results.

Upon arriving in Copenhagen, Dulles repeatedly poured cold water on the summit conference. He insisted that the Soviet Union was not sincere in convening a high-level meeting and that the Soviet Union's refusal to accept the US's Arctic inspection plan indicated that it did not intend to ease international tensions. He attempted to obstruct the summit conference by slandering the Soviet Union. However, the conference's communiqué clearly did not fully reflect Dulles's tone. The communiqué stated that despite "disappointment and skepticism," governments "do not abandon" the attitude of seeking negotiations.

The communiqué's emphasis on the group's member states practicing "close cooperation without abandoning their independent policies" is noteworthy, as this is the first time in the history of the group's meeting communiqués that the word "independent" has appeared, rather than "contributions" and "sacrifices" made "for the supreme interests of the group."

The communiqué also particularly emphasized that the group's countries should strengthen economic cooperation. It seems that the shadow of the US economic crisis has deeply shrouded the participating countries, so much so that the communiqué had to state: "Political unity and effective defense organization are not enough… Every effort should be made to ensure economic prosperity…".

### 哥本哈根会议收场  美国未获得冷战预期效果

    哥本哈根会议收场
    美国未获得冷战预期效果
    据新华社8日讯　哥本哈根消息：北大西洋集团外交部长会议7日在哥本哈根结束。从会后发表的公报看来，美国国务卿对这个集团的操纵已经失灵了，杜勒斯在三天会议上的顽固阻挠东西方会谈的态度没有获得预期的效果。
    杜勒斯来到哥本哈根以后就一再给最高级会议泼冷水。他硬说苏联对召开高级会议没有诚意，苏联不接受美国的北极视察计划是不打算缓和国际紧张局势，他企图用诽谤苏联的办法来阻挠召开最高级会议。但是，会议的公报显然没有全盘反映杜勒斯的调子。公报说，尽管人们有着“失望和怀疑”，各国政府“不放弃”寻求谈判的态度。
    公报强调的这个集团成员国正在实行“密切合作而又不放弃自己独立的政策”的一段话是耐人寻味的，因为这是历史上第一次在这个集团的会议公报中出现了“独立”的字样，而不是“为了集团的至高无上的利益”作出“贡献”与“牺牲”。
    公报还特别强调这个集团国家要加强经济合作。看来，美国经济危机的阴影是这样深重地笼罩着与会各国，以致公报不得不表示：“单单有政治团结和有效的防御组织工作是不够的，……应当尽一切努力来保证经济繁荣……”。
