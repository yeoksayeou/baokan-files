    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    56 Pear Blossom
    Our temperament prefers tranquility,
    Welcoming the rain, as soft as butter, soaking through flourishing beauty.
    We love Lin Daiyu in *Dream of the Red Chamber*,
    Singing a poem for burying flowers, while feeling apprehensive.
    But, we are not melancholic and sickly,
    We have abundant, large fruits, sweet and clear.
    If Lin Daiyu were living today,
    She would be very healthy, and would not die young.

    57 Camellia
    Very simple, we are just a single petal,
    But with red flowers and yellow stamens, the color is deep and fresh.
    Blooming in the dark green foliage, covering branches and trees,
    Blooming in the lush mountains, covering streams and hills.
    The girls in the mountains are just as simple,
    They are simple, healthy, sincere, generous, and capable.
    Their faces are as yellow as gilding, their cheeks as red as burning coal,
    Wearing a camellia in their hair, ah, so beautiful!

    58 Camellia
    In Yunnan Province, we are considered the provincial flower,
    The variety and beauty of flowers here are truly unmatched under heaven.
    This is not just blindly learning from Old Wang selling melons (note),
    If you don't believe it, please fly to Kunming and take a look.
    Flying from Beijing to Kunming takes only a little over half a day,
    Eat *wowotou* in the morning, and *guo qiao mixian* in the evening.
    Once you arrive in Kunming, you're guaranteed to fall in love with us,
    But please don't forget, the time should be around Qingming Festival.
     (Note) Proverb: "Old Wang selling melons, praising his own wares."

    59 Osmanthus
    We have already registered: to participate in interstellar navigation,
    Flying to the moon to visit old man Wu Gang.
    To add some ingredients to the osmanthus wine he brews (note),
    And invite Sister Chang'e to dance in feather robes and neon skirts.
    Sister Chang'e has long had the hope of returning to the country,
    Let her bring the Jade Rabbit back to her hometown together.
    Old man Wu Gang, his blood pressure is probably a little high,
    Whether he can return depends on the doctor's diagnosis.
    (Note) Chairman Mao's "Butterfly Loves Flowers" lyrics: "Wu Gang presents osmanthus wine."

    60 Bauhinia
    In ancient times, bauhinia was regarded as the flower of brotherhood,
    And now the scope of brotherhood has expanded greatly.
    We have a fraternal group headed by the Soviet Union,
    As well as all oppressed nations and countries.
    Our flowers must bloom more and more abundantly,
    Our flower color must bloom more and more red and thoroughly.
    We want to embody socialist mutual assistance,
    So that red flowers bloom all over the world, without end.

    61 Crape Myrtle
    We are crape myrtle, also called hundred-day red,
    In the crisp autumn air, our graceful branches welcome the wind.
    Painting out red clouds in arrays, thousands of layers upon layers,
    A slight scratch on the bark, our whole body will shake.
    People therefore also love to call us itchy flowers,
    But in fact, we are not itchy, and we are not afraid.
    Just reminding people to be more well-behaved,
    Why do you use your hands to grab the flowers and trees?
            [Pear Blossom Li Hua Woodcut]

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    56　梨花
    我们的性情比较喜欢幽静，
    欢迎如酥的春雨湿透繁英。
    我们爱石头记中的林黛玉，
    一面吟着葬花诗，一面屏营。
    但是，我们却不是多愁而善病，
    我们有丰富的硕果，甜而且清。
    假如林黛玉是生长在今天呵，
    她一定会十分健康，不会短命。
    57　山茶花
    简单得很，我们只是一种单瓣，
    但花红蕊黄，颜色是又深又鲜。
    开在暗绿的叶丛中，满枝满树，
    开在蓊郁的山地里，满磵满山。
    山地的姑娘们也是一样简单，
    她们朴素、健康、诚恳、大方、能干。
    面孔黄如镀金，两颊红如燃炭，
    头上带朵茶花，嗳呀呀，真好看！
      58　茶花
    在云南省是把我们当成省花，
    花类之多、之好，真正是甲天下。
    并不是胡乱地在学老王卖瓜，（注）
    不信，你请飞到昆明去看一下。
    从北京飞昆明只要半天多点，
    早上吃窝窝头，晚上过江米线。
    到了昆明，包管你会爱上我们，
    但请不要忘记，时节要在清明。
     （注）谚语：“老王卖瓜，自卖自夸。”
      59　桂花
    我们已经登记：参加星际通航，
    飞到月球里去访问老人吴刚。
    替他酿出的桂花酒添点原料，（注）
    请嫦娥姐姐跳舞起羽衣霓裳。
    嫦娥姐姐早就有回国的希望，
    让她带着玉兔一同回到故乡。
    吴刚老人，血压恐怕高得一些，
    能否回来，要请大夫作出主张。
    （注）主席“蝶恋花”词句：“吴刚捧出桂花酒。”
    60　紫荆花
    紫荆花在古时是作为兄弟花，
    而今兄弟的范围扩展得很大。
    有了以苏联为首的兄弟集团，
    还有一切被压迫的民族国家。
    我们的花朵要开得更多更厚，
    我们的花色要开得更红更透。
    我们要体现社会主义的互助，
    使红花开遍全世界，没有尽头。
    61　紫薇花
    我们是紫薇花又叫百日红，
    秋高气爽，绰约的枝条迎风。
    点画出红霞成阵，千重万重，
    皮上轻轻一搔，全身都会摇动。
    人们因此又爱叫作怕痒花，
    其实我们倒不痒，并也不怕。
    只是告诫人们要规矩一些，
    为什么对于花木用手乱抓？
            〔梨花　李桦木刻〕
