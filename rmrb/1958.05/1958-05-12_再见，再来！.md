Goodbye, See You Again!
　　Hua Min
　　In March and mid-April, the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's agricultural production inspection team inspected agricultural production in 71 counties across the province. The Huanggang branch team, led by Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor of the province, visited some townships and communes in all thirteen counties of the Huanggang Special Zone. At the on-site meeting of county party secretaries held in Xishui County, they evaluated the work of each county. The inspection team used more than 50 big-character posters to evaluate the work of each county. The big-character posters highly praised the production achievements of Macheng, Hong'an, and other counties. The big-character poster for Macheng County read:

　　Macheng County, Three Diligences and Five Goods (note), all aspects of work are comprehensive;
　　Production plans are very advanced, and measures are well-formulated;
　　Production balance looks good, and field management is even more advanced.
　　Cadres and the masses are all modest, good at summarizing and good at research,
　　Ideological work is tightly grasped, and production is at the forefront,
　　Everyone praises after seeing it, saying it's really good;
　　Guard against arrogance and impatience to remain advanced, and strive to be a flower nationwide.

　　The inspection team also composed a quick-board verse entitled "Goodbye" regarding their overall impressions of the inspection of the Huanggang Special Zone, followed by the Huanggang Prefectural Party Committee and the county party committees responding with a quick-board verse entitled "See You Again".

　　The quick-board verse made by the Provincial Party Committee inspection team is:

　　                                                                                  (1) Promotion
　　The Provincial Party Committee Huanggang inspection team, traveled all thirteen counties in the district,
　　Inspection promotes production, learning and visiting good experiences,
　　Cadres and masses are encouraged, and they have offered their determination,
　　Adding fuel to the fire, the waves push the waves, and production is more and more enthusiastic.

　　                                                                                  (2) Harvest
　　A month of cursory observation, full of dazzling things,
　　This harvest is really big, learned the drive and took the treasure,
　　We will return to the province to report good news to the Provincial Party Committee.

　　                                                                                  (3) Goodbye
　　 Learning and visiting time is short, and fresh things have not been seen,
　　 The inspection is rough and the help is little, and the opinions are for reference,
　　 Please accept the correct opinions, and if there is any discrepancy, forget it,
　　 Our work has shortcomings, and we welcome everyone to make suggestions,
　　 Work together to leap forward, and see you again in the autumn inspection.

　　The quick-board verse made by the Huanggang Prefectural Party Committee and the county party committees is:

　　                                                                                  (1) Welcome
　　The leap forward spring is extraordinary, welcoming the Provincial Party Committee inspection team,
　　Adding flowers to the brocade is infinitely good, and the people are encouraged and happy.

　　                                                                                  (2) Example
　　Braving the wind and rain without complaining, looking everywhere in communities and townships,
　　The mass line method is good, and the leadership style is a good example.

　　                                                                                  (3) Promotion
　　Inspection and supervision have great power, moving mountains and filling seas with great force,
　　Agriculture and sideline industries are done well together, galloping on a steed with renewed efforts.

　　                                                                                  (4) Rectification
　　Every instruction is good advice, engraved in the heart as a spur,
　　Spring breeze and rain promote rectification, with immediate results today.

　　                                                                                  (5) Determination
　　Now the will is stronger, a good time to break the waves and ride the wind,
　　Study diligently, work hard and be practical, a hundred catties of ginned cotton and a thousand catties of grain.

　　                                                                                  (6) See You Again
　　Spring is the time for general planting to promote fruits, autumn is the time for abundant harvests,
　　Diligently cultivate and do not slack off, and welcome relatives to "see the flowers" again.

　　(Note) Three Diligences and Five Goods refer to diligence and thrift in building the country, diligence and thrift in running the commune, and diligence and thrift in managing the household; good production, good work, good study, the combination of departments and the central task is good, and the leadership is good.

　　再见，再来！

    中共湖北省委农业生产检查团在3月中旬到4月中旬的一个月中，检查了全省七十一个县的农业生产。黄冈分团在省委书记、省长张体学同志带领下，跑遍黄冈专区十三个县的部分乡社后，在浠水县召开的全区县委书记现场会议上，对各县工作进行了评比。检查团用五十多张大字报对各县工作给予了评价。大字报中，对麻城、红安等县生产成就大加赞扬。对麻城县的大字报是：
      三勤五好麻城县（注），各项工作都全面；
      生产规划很先进，措施订得也周全；
      生产平衡很受看，田间管理更占先。
      干部群众都虚心，善于总结善钻研，
      思想工作抓得紧，生产一马走在前，
      看了之后个个夸，都说搞得真不差；
      戒骄戒躁永先进，争取全国一朵花。
    检查团对黄冈专区整个检查的观感，还以“再见”为题作快板一首，接着黄冈地委和各县委又以“再来”为题写快板一首作答。
    省委检查团作的快板是：

      我们回到省里去，再向省委报喜讯。
                  （三）再见
　　  学习访问时间短，新鲜事物没看见，
　　  检查粗糙帮助少，所提意见供参考，
　　  正确意见请收下，如有出入就算了，
　　  我们工作有缺点，欢迎大家提意见，
　　  共同努力齐跃进，秋季检查再见面。
　　  黄冈地委和各县委作的快板是：
          （一）欢迎
　　跃进春天不平凡，迎到省委检查团，
　　锦上添花无限好，万民鼓舞万民欢。
          （二）榜样
　　栉风沐雨不辞烦，社社乡乡到处看，
　　群众路线方法好，领导作风好榜样。
          （三）促进
　　检查督促力量大，移山填海劲冲天，
　　农业副业齐作好，跨上骏马又加鞭。
          （四）整改
　　条条指示尽良言，刻骨铭心作策鞭，
　　化雨春风催整改，立竿见影在今天。
          （五）决心
　　如今意志更坚强，破浪乘风好时光，
　　勤学苦钻多实干，百斤皮棉千斤粮。
          （六）再来
　　春天普种促进果，秋天遍结丰收瓜，
　　辛勤耕耘莫松懈，再迎亲人来“看花”。
　　（注）三勤五好是指勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家；生产好、工作好、学习好、部门结合中心好、领导好。
