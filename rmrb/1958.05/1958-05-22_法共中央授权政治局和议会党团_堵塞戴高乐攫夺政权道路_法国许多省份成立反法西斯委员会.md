Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 20th - The Central Committee of the French Communist Party met today and approved the decisions made by the Political Bureau after the Algiers uprising, the activities of the Communist parliamentary group, and its attitude in various parliamentary votes.

The Central Committee expressed satisfaction that initial significant achievements had been made in defending the legal system of the Republic, thanks to the vigilance and actions of the French Communist Party and the united action of the working class and the broad masses of democratic people. The resolution stated that the plot orchestrated by the rioters had been exposed, and De Gaulle had revealed himself as the instigator and leader of the riots. However, the victory of the Republic is not yet guaranteed. The danger remains great.

After a thorough analysis of the situation, the Central Committee unanimously authorized the Political Bureau and the parliamentary group with full power to take all measures to ensure the protection of the republican system and the freedom rights of the working class in any situation, to block the path of the rioters led by De Gaulle in seizing power, and to crush any attempt to establish a personal dictatorship in France supported by social reactionary forces, militarism, and extreme colonialists advocating a full-scale war in North Africa.

Currently, the working people and people from all walks of life in France are widely mobilizing to counter the conspiracy against the republican system. In the Seine province alone, 55 anti-fascist committees have been established in industrial enterprises in recent days. Committees to defend the republican system and to be vigilant against fascist conspiracies have been established in the provinces of Orne, Cantal, Côte-d'Or, Meurthe-et-Moselle, Manche, Eure, Lot-et-Garonne, Haute-Pyrénées, Gard, Morbihan, Marne, Vosges, Drôme, and Haute-Garonne.

    法共中央授权政治局和议会党团
    堵塞戴高乐攫夺政权道路
    法国许多省份成立反法西斯委员会
    据新华社巴黎20日电　法国共产党中央委员会今天开会，批准了政治局在阿尔及尔暴动后作出的决定、共产党议会党团的活动以及它在议会各次投票中的态度。
    由于法国共产党的警惕和行动，由于工人阶级和广大民主群众的一致行动，在保卫共和国法制方面已经取得了初步的重大成就，中央委员会对此表示满意。决议说，暴乱分子策划的阴谋已经被揭穿，戴高乐已经露出了暴乱鼓动者和领导者的原形。然而，共和国的胜利还没有保障。危险仍然很大。
    中央委员会在深入地分析了局势以后，一致授给政治局和议会党团以采取一切措施的全权，以便在任何情况下都确实保卫住共和制度和工人阶级的自由权利，堵塞戴高乐领导的暴乱分子攫夺政权的道路，并且粉碎想在法国建立以社会反动势力、军国主义、主张在北非进行全面战争的极端殖民主义者为支柱的个人独裁制度。
    目前，法国劳动人民和各阶层人士正在广泛动员起来，反击针对共和制度的阴谋。仅在最近几天，塞纳省的工业企业就成立了五十五个反法西斯委员会。奥尔纳、康特尔、黄金海滨、穆尔特—摩塞尔、芒歇、欧尔、罗特—加隆、上比犁斯、加尔、莫尔比盎、马恩、孚日省、德罗摩、上加隆等省都成立了保卫共和政体、警惕法西斯阴谋的委员会。
