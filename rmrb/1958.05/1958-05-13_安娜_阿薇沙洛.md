　　Anna Avixalo
    In the Afumați State Farm in Romania, there is a capable female work team leader, Anna Avixalo. She leads the poultry farm, a "kingdom" whose subjects are seven thousand chickens. This "kingdom" has achieved great things, obtaining six hundred thousand eggs and hatching two hundred thousand chicks last year.
    Excellent work performance has made Anna Avixalo famous throughout the country. She has given reports on her working methods to all poultry farmers in Romania, passing on her advanced experience to everyone.
    Anna Avixalo did not have the opportunity to go to school as a child. In the old days, how easy was it for a country girl to study! After liberation, Anna began to study greedily, particularly diligently studying knowledge about poultry farming. Now, although she doesn't have any school graduation certificates, her skills are no less than those of experts who graduated from regular schools. She is currently studying at a correspondence middle school and is about to graduate.
    The girls who work with Anna Avixalo all love her and regard her as their closest friend. Take the breeder Rusa Dela for example, when she was preparing to get married, she even consulted Anna on the arrangements for her post-marital family financial life.
    In this way, Anna Avixalo was elected as a representative to the Romanian Grand National Assembly, and the people entrusted her with participating in the management of national affairs.

　　安娜·阿薇沙洛
    在罗马尼亚阿芙玛茨国营农场，有一位能干的女工作队长安娜·阿薇沙洛。她领导着家禽饲养场，这是一个“王国”，它的子民是七千只鸡。这个“王国”成就很大，去年获得了六十万个鸡蛋，孵出了二十万只小鸡。
    优良的工作成绩使安娜·阿薇沙洛誉满全国，她向罗马尼亚所有的家禽饲养者作了关于她的工作方法的报告，把自己的先进经验传授给了大家。
    安娜·阿薇沙洛小时没有机会上学。在旧时代，一个乡下姑娘要读书谈何容易！解放后，安娜开始贪婪地学习，特别用心钻研关于家禽饲养方面的知识。现在，她虽然没有任何学校的毕业证书，可是本领却一点也不亚于从正规学校毕业的专家。目前她正在函授中学读书，已经快毕业了。
    同安娜·阿薇沙洛一起工作的姑娘们都很爱她，把她看作最知心的朋友。就拿饲养员鲁莎德拉来说吧，她在准备结婚的时候，连婚后家庭经济生活的安排都征求了安娜的意见。
    就这样，安娜·阿薇沙洛被选为罗马尼亚大国民议会的代表，人民委托她参与国家大事的管理。
