Xinhua News Agency, May 30th dispatch from Paris: Facing the irresistible torrent of the French people's struggle against fascism and to defend republican democracy, the forces within the French ruling clique supporting de Gaulle are using extraordinary procedures to force parliament and various parties to agree to accept de Gaulle coming to power.

    French President Coty, going against convention, personally stepped forward on the afternoon of the 29th, using the pretext of the critical situation to fully demand that parliament support de Gaulle forming a cabinet. That evening, he announced the formal invitation for de Gaulle to form a government, while also inviting de Gaulle from his country residence to the Élysée Palace in Paris for talks. A presidential palace communique said that Coty would begin meeting with the leaders of parliamentary groups of various parties this morning to discuss the issue of accepting de Gaulle forming a cabinet. Observers in Paris pointed out that the method adopted by Coty was also "a special procedure," because usually the person forming the cabinet directly negotiates with the party leaders to seek support, rather than the president carrying out this work. At the same time, there are reports that de Gaulle himself will also contact some party leaders, carrying out a two-pronged approach.

    At the same time, after being instructed to form a cabinet, de Gaulle immediately put forward some "indispensable" conditions to Coty to ensure his coming to power, threatening that parliament must agree. In a statement issued after his meeting with Coty, de Gaulle explained that these "conditions" were: first, to demand full powers to take action and promulgate laws "for a certain period of time" without the need for parliamentary approval. In this regard, it was revealed that de Gaulle once expressed the necessity of adjourning parliament for a year so that he could wield power alone without any constraints. Secondly, he demanded that the National Assembly agree to allow his government to propose a "reform" bill to the current constitution, and then submit it for a "citizen referendum."

    According to Agence France-Presse, de Gaulle also demanded that the National Assembly adopt an "extraordinary procedure" on the issue of authorizing him to form a cabinet: first, the National Assembly should vote on a resolution regarding him personally, and then proceed with the normal authorization steps. That is to say, the parliament must issue a blank check in advance, expressing unconditional support for him before listening to the policy program that the new prime minister must usually present when requesting authorization.

    In order to force the National Assembly to submit to him, de Gaulle and those Algerian rioters who support him openly threatened the deputies of various parties with civil war and military coups. In a letter to former President, Socialist Party elder Auriol, published on the 29th, de Gaulle said that the obstacles he encountered in parliament risked causing the Algerian rebels and the French army who supported him to "break through the barriers, even overwhelming the control of the commander." He threatened that this would lead to "anarchy and civil war," and those who did not allow him to come to power would have to "bear a heavy responsibility" for the consequences. On the same day, the spokesman of the Algerian rebel group also openly clamored that if de Gaulle was not allowed to come to power, they would "take action" to achieve this goal.

    Currently, the main "winning over" target of the forces supporting de Gaulle is the Socialist Party. The parliamentary group of this party had expressed its resistance to de Gaulle. At a special meeting convened on the evening of the 29th, it failed to reach a consensus on whether to support de Gaulle coming to power, but under pressure from the right-wing leaders of this party who support de Gaulle and right-wing groups outside the party, it was reported that the meeting passed a motion by sixty-two votes to twenty-nine, approving Auriol's letter to de Gaulle, calling on de Gaulle to come out and clean up the situation, as the basis for establishing direct contact with de Gaulle. Some Western observers believe that this resolution of the Socialist Party's parliamentary group is a step towards compromise with de Gaulle.

    法国总统采取违反常规手段
    强迫议会让戴高乐上台
    戴高乐以内战来要挟各党派议员
    新华社30日讯　巴黎消息：面对着法国人民反法西斯和保卫共和民主的不可抗拒的斗争洪流，法国统治集团中支持戴高乐的势力正在通过非常程序来强使议会和各政党同意接受戴高乐上台。
    法国总统戈蒂在29日下午一反常规，亲自出面以局势危急作为借口，全力要求议会支持戴高乐组阁。当天晚上，他就宣布正式邀请戴高乐组织政府，同时把戴高乐从他的乡间住所请到巴黎爱丽舍宫总统府去会谈。总统府公报说，戈蒂将在今天上午开始接见各政党议会党团的领袖讨论接受戴高乐组阁问题。巴黎观察家指出，戈蒂采取的这种办法也是“一个特别程序”，因为通常总是由组阁人直接同各党领袖商谈寻求支持，而不是由总统来进行这一工作的。同时，有消息说，戴高乐本人也将同一些政党领袖接触，进行双管齐下的活动。
    同时，戴高乐在受命组阁以后，立即向戈蒂提出了保证他上台的一些“必不可少的”条件，要挟议会必须同意。戴高乐在同戈蒂会谈后发表的声明里说明这些“条件”是：首先，要求“在一定时期内”不须经过议会批准即可采取行动和颁布法律的全权。在这方面，据透露，戴高乐曾经表示，有必要使议会休会一年使他可以独揽大权，不受任何牵制。其次，他要求国民议会同意让他的政府对现行宪法提出“改革”法案，然后交付“公民表决”。
    据法新社报道，戴高乐还要求国民议会在授权他组阁的问题上也采取“非常程序”：先由国民议会表决通过一项关于他个人的决议，然后再来进行正常的授权步骤。这就是说，要议会预先开出一张空白支票，在听取通常新总理要求授权时必须提出的施政纲领以前就对他表示无条件的支持。
    为了迫使国民议会向他屈膝，戴高乐以及那些支持他的阿尔及利亚暴乱分子公开以内战和军事政变来威胁各党派议员。戴高乐在29日公布他给前总统、社会党元老阿里奥尔的信件说，他在议会中遭到的阻碍，有使支持他的阿尔及利亚叛乱的分子和法国军队“冲破壁垒，甚至压倒司令官（的控制）的危险”。他恫吓说，这样就要引起“无政府状态和内战”，而那些不让他上台的人要对后果“负重大责任”。同一天，阿尔及利亚叛乱集团的发言人也公开叫嚣，如果不让戴高乐上台，他们就要“采取行动”来达到这个目的。
    目前，支持戴高乐的势力的主要“争取”目标是社会党。这个党的议会党团曾经表示过它对戴高乐的抵制态度。它在29日晚上专门召开的会议上没有能就是否支持戴高乐上台问题取得一致意见，但是在支持戴高乐的这个党的右翼领导和党外右翼集团的压力下，有消息说，这次会议以六十二票对二十九票通过一项议案，批准把阿里奥尔给戴高乐的一封呼吁戴高乐出来收拾局面的信作为同戴高乐建立直接联系的基础。某些西方观察家认为，社会党议会党团的这个决议是走向同戴高乐妥协的一个步骤。
