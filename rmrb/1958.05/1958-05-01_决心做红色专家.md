    Determined to Become a Red Expert
    Yang Tingbao, Academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Head of the Department of Architecture, Nanjing Institute of Technology

    "Unable to recognize the true face of Mount Lu, simply because I am in the midst of the mountain." After liberation, I always thought I was working honestly and steadily, seemingly without any guilt towards the Party or the cause. This "Double-Anti" movement shattered my self-intoxicated dream. Faced with the facts, I began to see that my capitalist design ideology had harmed students and caused losses to the Party's architectural cause. In past years, in recent days, I was always vaguely unable to see my own problems. Thinking carefully, this was simply because I was hesitating in the circle of bourgeois academic thought. Looking back on the past, it's like a different world.

    I was educated in a capitalist country. There, architectural design was purely aestheticism and formalism, with very little consideration given to engineering technical problems. What I learned was that set of things. After liberation, I unconsciously spread that set of things to my students like bacteria. On the podium, although I spoke a little about new things at the beginning, as I continued, I unconsciously changed and returned to the path of capitalist design thinking. The formalism of "proportional embellishment" and other aesthetic viewpoints often overshadowed engineering technical education. To connect with reality, I asked students to design the neighborhood of Banqiao Town residents in the suburbs of Nanjing. Banqiao is a small rural market town, but the students designed building complexes of two to eleven stories. I saw how seriously they were detached from reality. But a series of excuses arose in my mind: "This is a school assignment, giving students practice in technique, that's not necessarily a bad thing." In this way, not only did I not stop them, but I allowed the students to continue doing it. At the same time, the blueprints given to students for reference were 70% or 80% from capitalist countries. My personal teaching ideology was like this, so how could the architecture department I led be any different? Students, nurtured in such an environment, increasingly embraced aestheticism, a focus on form, and the pursuit of luxurious capitalist design ideas. They were enthusiastic about thin shells, flat roofs, steel windows, carpets, sofas, pianos... They were moving further and further away from the reality of national construction and the points of conflict with the Party's architectural guidelines were growing. In this way, I caused incalculable economic and political losses to the country in terms of cultivating talent. It costs the country 10,000 yuan to train a student, but the students who graduate cannot be immediately useful and need at least a year or even more to explore before they can meet the needs of the country. One of my students wasted as much as one million yuan of national funds in his six years of design work after leaving school. This is inseparable from the bourgeois design ideology he received at school. Politically, because we did not implement the Party's architectural guidelines in teaching, coupled with the influence of the "masterpiece" thinking of old teachers, graduates often could not design low-standard buildings when they arrived at their work posts. On the contrary, they aimed high, pursued beauty, and had varying degrees of resistance to the Party's architectural guidelines. There were also a few students who developed to the point of opposing the Party's leadership in architecture and opposing the set of socialist architectural systems, eventually degenerating into rightists. This lesson is painful. Who cultivated them? They are like the branches of a tree, and we old professors are like the roots of the tree. If we don't dig up the old roots of bourgeois ideology, don't change our stance, and don't reflect on ourselves at night, how can we be worthy of the Party? How can we be worthy of the younger generation?

    The architectural projects I have personally handled should also be accounted for. Before liberation, I was always engaged in architectural work, serving the reactionary ruling class and capitalists for more than 20 years. I designed many houses throughout the country, but not one was made for workers and peasants. After liberation, the teaching building of Nanjing University, which I designed, not only committed serious formalism, but also had an excessive safety factor for the foundation wall, increasing the cost. Similarly, in the design of the teaching building of Nanjing Aeronautical Institute, glazed tile ridge was used, wasting tens of thousands of yuan. After adding up the above accounts, my mind became clearer. My design work was mostly for the reactionary ruling class and the bourgeoisie, and too little for the workers and peasants. Until recently, I had never even thought about the residential buildings of more than 500 million peasants. The Party has shown me such care and trust, but I have not only failed to fulfill my duties, but have also caused serious losses. Looking back on the past and present, I am ashamed and I have failed the Party and the people.

    As mentioned above, I have made a series of mistakes, and in all conscience, they were unconscious. The reasons for the mistakes are related to my class origin and the education I received. I was born into a family of the exploiting class and floated in the old society. With my little bit of technology, I have always been valued by the reactionary ruling class, and I have always been in the upper class. After liberation, I have not undergone revolutionary training and have no feelings for the workers and peasants. At the same time, I have been deeply influenced by bourgeois education, and I have always used the old brains and old methods of serving the bourgeoisie to handle socialist affairs, so I have problems and make mistakes everywhere. In the rectification movement, I made up my mind to jump into the furnace of Laozi and refine myself for forty-nine days. To completely burn out my three styles and five airs, and become a deeply red and specialized intellectual who truly serves the proletariat.

    My preliminary plan for becoming deeply red and specialized is as follows:

    1. Actively respond to the Party's call and participate in various political movements; in teaching work, resolutely implement the Party's architectural guidelines and policies, wholeheartedly give my heart to the Party, rely on and respect the Party's grassroots organizations, and strive to become a veritable leftist within a year.
    2. Strengthen the study of political theory, and complete the study of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong within two years. Among them, combine my own thoughts and viewpoints with class analysis, "On Contradiction," and "On Practice," and write learning experiences to be analyzed and criticized by the grassroots Party organization.
    3. Achieve the unity of theory and practice, and put politics in command in business:
        (1) Go to the construction site at least once a month to understand the construction of students and the labor of workers, participate in physical labor as much as possible, and cultivate my labor habits and feelings for workers and peasants.
        (2) Participate in the design of various low-standard buildings in construction units, train myself in work, and achieve true technology serving production.
        (3) In scientific research, strive to solve the urgent problems in current production and construction, such as the design of low-standard hospitals, etc.
    4. I am already fifty-eight years old, but I am determined not to admit that I am old. I will strive to ensure that the achievements I have made in various architectural works in the coming years will far exceed the work I have done in serving the exploiting classes, and I am determined to hand over all my knowledge to the younger generation; to strictly demand myself, and to train with them to become deeply red and specialized proletarian intellectuals; on another aspect of business, I will organize young teachers as much as possible to analyze, criticize, study, and improve the architectural designs and buildings I have designed in the past.
    5. I am determined to do a good job in the department; to wholeheartedly cultivate the next generation of young people; to resolutely study advanced Soviet experience; to clarify the ideological stand of serving the proletariat, and to oppose capitalist ideological tendencies in teaching.

    On the road of life, the long night has passed. In the days of self-transformation in the future, I will not hesitate to uproot any star-like or point-like roots of the bourgeoisie, otherwise, the wind will blow and the grass will grow, and my project of self-transformation will not be consolidated.

    决心做红色专家
    中国科学院学部委员  南京工学院建筑系系主任  杨廷宝
    “不识庐山真面目，只缘身在此山中。”解放后，我一直认为自己在那里老老实实工作，对党、对事业似乎无所愧疚。这次“双反”运动，打破了自我陶醉的迷梦。在事实面前，我开始看到自己的资本主义设计思想，已经贻害了学生，对党的建筑事业带来了损失。前些年头，前些日子，总是蒙蒙胧胧地看不到自己的问题。细想起来，这无非是自己踟蹰在资产阶级学术思想的圈子里的缘故。回首往事，恍如隔世。
    我是在资本主义国家里受教育的。在那里，建筑设计是不折不扣的唯美主义与形式主义，工程技术问题考虑得很少。我学来的，也就是那一套。解放后，我还是不自觉地把那套东西，像细菌一样传播给学生。在讲台上，虽然自己开宗明义时讲了一点新东西，然而，讲到后来，又不自觉地变了样，回到资本主义设计思想那条道路。“比例陪衬”那套唯美观点的形式主义的东西，往往湮没了工程技术的教育。为了联系实际，要学生作南京近郊板桥镇居民点的街坊设计。板桥是农村小集镇，而学生却设计了二至十一层楼的建群筑。脱离实际如此严重，我是看到的。但脑子里的一系列借口油然而生：“这是学校里的题目，给学生训练手法，那又未尝不可。”就这样，不但没有阻止，反而放任学生继续做下去。同时，教师发给学生参考的蓝图，十之七、八是资本主义国家的。我个人的教学思想是如此，我所领导的建筑系又安能例外。学生在这样的环境里熏陶，唯美主义、讲究形式与追求豪华的资本主义设计思想与日俱增。他们热中于薄壳、平顶、钢窗、地毯、沙发、钢琴……。他们离开国家建筑现实日远，与党的建筑方针的抵触面愈来愈大。就这样，我在培养人才方面就给国家造成了经济上与政治上的难以估计的损失。培养一个学生要国家花一万元，结果毕业出去的学生却不能立刻顶用，至少需要一年、甚至更多的时间摸索，才能适合国家的需要。我的一个学生，在他离校后的六年设计工作中，就浪费了国家资金达一百万元之巨。这与他在学校里所受的资产阶级设计思想是分不开的。在政治上，由于我们在教学中没有贯彻党的建筑方针，加上受老教师“杰作”思想的影响，毕业生们到了工作岗位，往往不能设计低标准的建筑，相反，他们好高鹜远，追求美观，对党的建筑方针，有不同程度的抵触情绪。也有少数学生，发展到反对党对建筑的领导，反对社会主义建筑上的一套制度，以致于堕落成为右派。这种教训，令人沉痛。他们是谁培养出来的呢？他们好比是树的枝，我们老年教授好比是树的根。假如我们不挖资产阶级的思想老根，不转变立场，清夜扪心，这又怎样对得起党？又怎样对得起青年一代？
    我自己经手的建筑工程，也应该算一笔账。解放前，我一直从事建筑师业务，为反动统治阶级和资本家服务二十余年。在全国设计了许多房子，就没有一幢是为工农而作。解放后，我所设计的南京大学教学大楼，不仅犯了严重的形式主义，而且地脚墙的安全系数过大，增加了造价，同样，在南京航空学院教学大楼的设计中，采用了琉璃瓦十字脊，又浪费了几万元。从上面几笔账加起来一算，我的脑筋才比较清醒。我的设计工作为反动统治阶级和资产阶级作的多，为工农作的实在太少，甚至在不久以前，对五亿多农民的居住建筑，竟连想都没有想过。党对我这样关怀与信任，我不但职有未尽，而且还带来了严重的损失。追昔抚今，令人惭愧，实在有负于党，有负于人民。
    如前所述，我犯了一系列的错误，凭心而论，那是不自觉的。造成错误的原因，与我的阶级出身、所受的教育有关。我出身于剥削阶级家庭，沉浮在旧社会中，以自己的一点技术，一直被反动统治阶级所重视，自己也一直处在上层地位。解放后，没有经过革命的锻炼，对工农没有感情。同时，自己受资产阶级教育影响较深，动辄用为资产阶级服务的旧脑筋、老办法来处理社会主义的事务，因而就处处出毛病，处处犯错误。在整风运动中，我下定决心跳进了老君炉，炼它七七四十九天。把自己的三风五气，彻底烧尽，变成一个红透专深的、真正为无产阶级服务的知识分子。
    我的红透专深初步规划全文如下：
    1．积极响应党的号召，参加各种政治运动；在教学工作中，坚决贯彻党在建筑方面的方针政策，全心全意地把心交给党，依靠和尊重党的基层组织，争取在一年内做一个名副其实的左派。
    2．加强政治理论学习，两年以内学完毛泽东选集，其中对阶级分析、“矛盾论”、“实践论”等，结合自己的思想观点，写出学习心得，交基层党的组织分析批判。
    3．做到理论联系实际，业务中政治挂帅：
    （1）每月至少下工地一次，了解学生施工和工人劳动情况，尽可能的参加体力劳动，培养自己的劳动习惯和对工农群众的感情。
    （2）参加建筑单位的各种低标准建筑设计，从工作中锻炼自己，做到真正的技术为生产服务。
    （3）在科学研究中，争取解决当前生产建设中所迫切需要解决的问题，如低标准的医院设计等等。
    4．我年已五十八岁，但决不服老，争取在今后的年代里，在各项建筑工作中所取得的成绩，一定要远远地超过为剥削阶级服务所做的工作，并且下定决心，把我所有的全部知识交给青年一代；严格要求自己，和他们一道锻炼成为红透专深的无产阶级知识分子；在业务的另一个方面，尽可能组织青年教师，对我过去所设计的建筑设计和建筑物进行分析批判、研究和提高。
    5．决心把系的工作搞好；全心全意地培养下一代青年；坚决学习苏联先进经验；明确为无产阶级服务的思想立场，反对教学中的资本主义思想倾向。
    在人生道路上，漫漫的长夜过去了。今后，在自我改造的日子里，我将毫不痛惜地拔掉任何一星一点的资产阶级的草根，否则，风吹草长，我的自我改造的工程是不会巩固的。
