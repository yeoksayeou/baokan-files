　　This newspaper reports: Overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking that detaches from the situation in commercial work and relying on the masses to run commerce is a noteworthy new issue recently raised by Anyang County, Henan Province, in its egg market. At present, the county has fundamentally reversed the poor situation of egg procurement. The procurement volume in April increased by nearly half compared to the same period last year. The Second Commercial Department attaches great importance to the county's experience and has notified various regions to promote it, believing that it not only solves the method of purchasing eggs, but also addresses the issue of how commercial work should follow the mass line.
    Anyang County's annual egg production is over 1.3 million catties. Last year, the state purchased 750,000 catties in the county, accounting for 56% of the annual production. This year, the county's chicken farming plan has more than doubled compared to last year, and the state's procurement plan has also increased. However, the procurement situation in the first quarter was very poor, decreasing by a quarter compared to the same period last year.
    The earth-shaking socialist production and construction upsurge in the countryside has concentrated rural labor (including small vendors) on production and construction, leaving them with no time to go to the market to sell agricultural and sideline products and buy daily necessities. This is the new situation in the countryside since last year and the main characteristic of the current rural market. However, commercial cadres in Anyang County, when starting to purchase eggs, did not face this reality squarely, nor did they see that the original commercial network and the old methods of purchase and sale were far from meeting the farmers' needs for selling and buying under the new situation. Instead, they attributed the poor procurement to objective reasons. Some cadres said that the weather was cold in the first quarter this year, and the egg production season came late; others thought that farmers' lives had improved, and they ate more eggs, so the amount of eggs on the market decreased. Because of right-leaning conservative thinking that was detached from the situation, the operational methods inevitably followed the old approach of "waiting for goods to come to the door," unwilling to improve some of the past operating styles that were inconvenient for the masses.
    The Anyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China analyzed the problems existing in the current egg procurement work and decided to immediately take emergency measures in publicity and organization. On the one hand, it organized cadres to conduct investigations in the countryside to understand that there were indeed many eggs in the countryside, and farmers were eager to sell them, in order to increase the confidence of cadres in purchasing eggs. On the other hand, it launched a large-scale publicity campaign, and the slogan proposed to cadres was: "Don't dislike one is too little, don't dislike a cartload is too much, go to where there are eggs to collect. Work hard for three days, collect greatly for three days, and purchase all the eggs that farmers want to sell." Using clapper talks, comic dialogues, and loudspeakers, they carried out extensive publicity among the masses. After farmers understood the benefits of selling eggs to themselves and the country, they enthusiastically sold eggs to the state.
    At the same time, the Anyang County Committee of the Communist Party of China also took a series of organizational measures to facilitate mass sales. The first was to adjust the county's commercial network and quickly complete the "three-in-one" work. Five hundred and thirty-nine supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in the county's six hundred and two agricultural cooperatives. This commercial network, which combines with production and delves into the masses of farmers, is extremely popular with farmers, allowing them to buy or sell things without leaving their cooperatives. The second is to widely organize social forces to purchase, adopting methods such as students delivering eggs and teachers collecting eggs on behalf of the cooperatives. Students not only bring eggs from their own homes to school every day but also contract to collect eggs from their neighbors. Students are doing voluntary labor, and the supply and marketing cooperatives pay the school a 2%-3% commission for代购代理 procurement, which is used as the school's funding. In addition, the supply and marketing cooperatives also carry out night purchases, egg-for-goods exchanges, and door-to-door delivery services, and use some small vendors to go to remote areas or mountainous areas to collect eggs. In terms of calculation, in order to adapt to the habits of farmers, the past method of calculating by weight has been changed to calculating by the number of eggs.

### 安阳县鸡蛋市场提出了新问题　如何依靠群众办商业？

　　安阳县鸡蛋市场提出了新问题
　　如何依靠群众办商业？
　　本报讯　克服商业工作中脱离形势的右倾保守思想，依靠群众办商业，这是河南省安阳县最近在鸡蛋市场上提出的值得注意的新问题。目前这个县已从根本上扭转鸡蛋收购不好的局面。四月份的收购量，比去年同期增加近一半。第二商业部对这个县的经验非常重视，已通报各地推广。认为它不仅解决了收购鸡蛋的方法问题，而且是商业工作如何走群众路线的问题。
    安阳县鸡蛋每年产量都在一百三十万斤以上。去年国家在这个县收购了七十五万斤，占年产量的56％。今年全县养鸡计划比去年增加一倍以上，国家的收购计划也比去年增大；但第一季度收购情况很坏，比去年同期还减少四分之一。
    农村中移山倒海的社会主义生产建设高潮，使农村劳动力（连小商小贩在内）都集中到生产建设上去，而没有时间赶集出售农副产品和购买日用品，这是去年以来农村的新形势，也是当前农村市场的主要特点。但是安阳县商业干部在开始收购鸡蛋时，并没有正视这个现实，更没有看到原有商业网的设置和老一套的购销方法，已远远不能适应在新形势下农民的出售和购买要求，反而把收购不好的原因推之客观。如有的干部说，今年第一季度天气寒冷，鸡蛋生产季节来得迟；有的认为是农民生活改善了，鸡蛋吃得多了，所以上市量少了。由于脑子里有脱离形势的右倾保守思想，表现在经营方法上必然是沿用“等货上门”的老办法，不愿改进过去一些不便利群众的经营作风。
    中共安阳县委分析了当前鸡蛋收购工作中存在的问题，决定立即从宣传和组织上采取紧急措施。一面组织干部到农村调查，了解农村中确有不少鸡蛋，农民也迫切要求出售，以提高干部收购鸡蛋的信心；一面展开了声势浩大的宣传工作，对干部提出的口号是：“一个不嫌少，一车不嫌多，那里有到那里收。苦战三天，大收三天，把农民要出售的鸡蛋全部收购起来。”并利用快板、相声、广播筒在群众中进行广泛宣传，农民明白了出售鸡蛋对己对国家的好处以后，都踊跃把鸡蛋卖给国家。
    与此同时，中共安阳县委还从组织上采取了一系列便利群众出售的措施。首先是调整全县的商业网，迅速完成“三合一”工作。全县六百零二个农业社已建立五百三十九个供销部。这种与生产相结合、深入到农民群众中的商业网，极受农民的欢迎，使农民可以不走出社就能买到或卖出东西。第二是广泛组织社会力量收购，采用了学生送蛋，教员代收的方法。学生每天上学时除了把自己家里的鸡蛋带到学校，还包收左右邻居的鸡蛋。学生是义务劳动，由供销社付给学校2％——3％的代购手续费，作为学校的经费。此外，供销社还开展夜间收购、以货换蛋、送货下乡的业务，并利用一些小商小贩到边远地区或山区去收购。在计算方面，为了适应农民的习惯，也由过去按斤计算改为论个计算的办法。
