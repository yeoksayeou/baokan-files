    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    51. Tuberose
    Speaking of simplicity, we are quite simple,
    But we regard delicacy as shame and disgust.
    We are not very happy with Miaoyu in the Story of the Stone,
    That beautiful nun is a bit too affected.
    The writer wants to embarrass her; there is a lesson here:
    Extremes turn to opposites; purity falls to prostitution.
    What we like is: frankness, generosity;
    What we respect is: modesty, approachability.

    52. Night-Blooming Jasmine
    Slender vine flowers are really nothing much,
    Small flowers, good fragrance, pale green buds.
    Not qualified to be in the limelight during the day, fragrance comes with the night,
    Good friends are gentle breeze, drizzle, new moon, and kittens.
    Sichuan chefs, their skills are really superb,
    They stir-fry shredded chicken with us.
    Fragrant, sweet, unique, and fresh,
    Have you eaten it? The taste is indescribably wonderful.

    53. Cassia Seed
    Our leaves resemble alfalfa but are larger, flowers like golden coins,
    Edible, and eating them can sharpen eyesight.
    The poet Du Fu once shed tears for us,
    He feared we would be blown to death by the west wind and rotted by the autumn rain. (Note)
    Thank him for his concern for us,
    But today's poets rarely know us.
    No wonder their eyesight is a bit dim,
    They can't even distinguish between good and bad poetry.

    (Note) One of Du Fu's "Autumn Rain Laments" in three parts: "A hundred herbs rot and die in the autumn rain, the cassia seed beneath the steps is brightly colored. Leaves cover the branches like a canopy of emerald feathers, countless golden coins bloom. The cool wind whistles and blows you urgently, fearing you will have difficulty standing alone later. The scholar in the hall has a white head, sniffing the fragrance and weeping in the wind."

    54. Lotus
    Zhou Dunyi of the Song Dynasty praised the lotus;
    He said we "emerge from the mud unsullied."
    Ignoring the function of the mud and only disliking its dirt,
    This is attacking one point without considering the rest.
    The lotus root, our root, is covered in mud,
    Aren't lotus roots and lotus flowers one entity?
    Anyone who despises mud and flaunts purity,
    That is typical of decadent thinking.

    55. Water Lily
    Don't misunderstand, we don't like to sleep;
    We just don't like the atmosphere of twilight, closing our flowers at night.
    Once past midnight, we open very early again,
    Welcoming the rising sun and the arrival of vitality in advance.
    Small flower shape, far inferior to the graceful lotus;
    The leaves are not perfectly round, densely covering the water surface like duckweed.
    If mandarin ducks are swimming in the clean pond,
    With us as accompaniment, it is indeed a beautiful scene.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    51晚香玉
    讲素净，我们倒还是相当素净，
    但我们把娇嫩当成耻辱，恶心。
    我们不大高兴石头记的妙玉，
    那位美尼姑是未免过分矫情。
    作家要使她难堪，这里有教训：
    极端转向对立，清高落到卖淫。
    我们喜欢的是：坦白，落落大方；
    我们尊重的是：谦虚，平易近人。
    52　夜来香
    纤细的藤草花实在算不得啥，
    花朵小，香气好，淡青色的花苞。
    白天没资格出风头，香随夜到，
    好朋友是和风、细雨、新月、小猫。
    四川的厨师们，手艺实在高超，
    他们把鸡肉丝和我们一道炒。
    又清香，又清甜，又别致，又新鲜，
    你吃过吗？味道有说不出的妙。
    53　决明
    我们叶似苜蓿而大，花如金钱，
    可供食用，吃了能使眼力更尖。
    诗人杜甫曾经为我们流过眼泪，
    他怕我们被西风吹死、秋雨澪烂。（注）
    感谢他对于我们那样地关心，
    但今天的诗人很少知道我们。
    无怪乎他们的眼力有点昏昏，
    连诗词的好坏也都辨别不清。
    （注）杜甫“秋雨叹”三首之一：“雨中百草秋烂死，阶下决明颜色鲜。著叶满枝翠羽盖，开花无数黄金钱。凉风萧萧吹汝急，恐汝后时难独立。堂上书生空白头，临风三嗅馨香泣。”
    54　荷花
    称赞莲花的宋朝有周濂溪；
    他说我们是“出污泥而不染”。
    不管泥的功用而只嫌其污，
    这也是攻其一点不计其余。
    藕，我们的根，满身都是污泥，
    莲藕和莲花难道不是一体？
    谁要鄙视污泥而标榜清高，
    那是典型的腐朽思想而已。
      55　睡莲
     不要误会，我们并不是喜欢睡觉；
    只是不高兴暮气，晚上把花闭了。
    一过了子夜我们又开放得很早，
    提前欢迎着太阳上升，朝气来到。
    花型小，比起亭亭玉立的荷花远逊；
    叶不正圆，密布在水面上有如浮萍。
   在洁净的池沼上如果有鸳鸯游泳，
   有我们作配，倒不失为优美的画景。
    睡莲〔木刻〕
            刘　岘
