Another Letter to Young Readers

Communication Five

Dear Children:

In my last letter, I mentioned my visit to Sicily. I had never been to this island before, so it made a very deep impression on me. This Sicily, known as the football at the tip of Italy's boot, has an area of 25,000 square kilometers and a population of over five million. During our trip here, we forged an indissoluble bond with the sea! The hotels where we stayed all faced the sea, and the restaurants where we dined with our Italian friends were also chosen for their scenic seaside locations. We could hear the cries of seagulls and the sound of the tide from our pillows, and while eating, it felt as if we were swallowing the azure water. The journey by car was along the winding coast. Looking out, there was either an endless sandy beach or jagged reefs, topped with towering bunkers. And the boundless sea in front of us always reflected the vast sky, changing endlessly and displaying a myriad of forms! Under the setting sun, the sea was crimson red; under the moonlight, it was silvery white; and under a clear sky, it was just like the ancient poem says: "The water is like jade, the mountains like ink," so brilliantly beautiful that it cannot be described! The colors were layered, deep blue in the distance, slightly closer was emerald green, and where streams and rivers flowed into the sea, the water was tinged with yellow. There is a Tang poem that says, "A ray of setting sun spreads in the water, half the river is emerald, half the river is red." These two lines are extremely well written, because they not only depict the setting sun, but even the slight breeze on the river is expressed in the word "emerald"!

On the other side of the car window, there were either neat fields with verdant crops, or orchards on the hillsides with hundreds and thousands of apricot trees, peach trees, orange trees, and olive trees. Flowers bloomed along the paths, a picturesque scene. The people who live on this fertile and beautiful land are to be envied!

However, yesterday morning, while browsing through a collection of Italian photographs given to us by the "Middle East and Oriental College" in Rome, I read the preface, which said: Sicily, surrounded by seas within seas, has also been inhabited by Greeks, Phoenicians, and Saracens, and occupied by Germans, French, and Spaniards... On Sicily, the farmers who were once the backbone of the Roman Empire's army lost their freedom. Under the heavy exploitation of usury, they lost their land and were recruited into a landless serf army. The landlords lived in the cities, only coming to their estates in the summer to escape the heat. Dynasties changed, and land changed hands, but even today, those who work hard on the land in Italy are not the owners of the land!

What a tragic situation! This football at the tip of Italy's boot has been kicked around by foreign rulers. Although some exquisite palaces and churches with the most delicate gemstone-inlaid patterns and vividly colored frescoes have been left behind in terms of culture and art, the lives of the local farmers have remained in a semi-feudal and semi-civilized state.

The tragic situation of "fields untended all around, yet farmers starve" still exists here!

At a dinner party in Rome, Italy's most famous poet, Carlo Levi, sat next to me. He told me incessantly about the oppressed and exploited lives of farmers in southern Italy, especially in the Sicily area. The industry in northern Italy is relatively developed, but the resources in the south have never been developed. As a result, the hungry and unemployed in the south are recruited in droves to work in the north, suffering and drifting, which has been their fate for thousands of years!

When the poet said these words, his expression was agitated, and his eyes were filled with grief and indignation, casting a dark shadow over my memories of the waters and mountains of Sicily! I also recalled another poet, Buttitta, who gave us the warmest welcome at a farmers' welcoming meeting in a small town on the island called Bagheria. Buttitta is the son of the poor people of Bagheria. He writes poetry in the Sicilian dialect, strongly exposing the dark lives of the local people. He gave me a French translation of his collection of poems, "Bread is Bread," with a preface by Carlo Levi, saying that Buttitta, with a steel-like, strong, and sonorous voice, cried out the misfortunes of the people on the island. Unfortunately, I don't understand French, so I'll have to ask someone to read it to me in the future.

The broad masses of the people are the vast sky, and the people's poet should be like the transparent sea under the sky, which always faithfully reflects the brightness, darkness, sunshine, and rain of the sky, and cries out the joys, sorrows, and hopes of the people. In this way, his poems will have color and emotion. Levi and Buttitta are both sea-like poets, and we should learn from them.

Today is Easter. I woke up early and heard the melodious and resounding bells ringing from all directions. There are more than five hundred churches of all sizes in Rome. Looking from a high place, the golden, green, and gray domes are hidden in layers among the trees. In the past few days, the streets of Rome, especially the shop windows, have been filled with a festive atmosphere, with large chocolate eggs made of golden and colorful chocolate everywhere. I went out for a walk this morning because I am going to Florence tomorrow, so I am sending you this letter first. The ancient sites of Rome can be discussed later!

Tonight, there is a heavy thunderstorm in Rome, with flashes of lightning and thunder as loud as cannons. Now it is morning in the motherland, and the children are on their way to school. I send you a sincere good morning!

Your friend, Bing Xin

    再寄小读者
    冰心
    通讯五亲爱的小朋友：
    在上一封信中，我曾提到了西西里岛的访问。这个岛，我从前没有到过，因此我对它的印象也最深。这个被称为意大利靴尖上的足球的西西里，面积有两万五千平方公里，居民在五百万以上。在这里的一段旅程，我们和海结了不解之缘！我们住的旅馆，都是面临大海的，我们和意大利朋友聚餐的饭店，也都挑选海边名胜之地；枕上听得见鸥鸣和潮响，用饭的时候，仿佛也在啖咽着蔚蓝的水光。一路乘车，更是沿着迂回的海岸，一眼望去，不是无际的平沙，就是嶙峋的礁石，上面还有耸立的碉堡，而眼前一片无边的海水，更永远是反映着空阔的天光，变幻无极，仪态万千！在斜阳之下，海水是绛红的；月光之下，海水是银白的；在晴朗的天空之下，更是像古诗上所说的：“水如碧玉山如黛”，光艳得不可描画！那颜色是一层一层的，远处是深蓝，稍近是碧绿，遇有溪河入海处，这一层水色又是微黄的。唐诗有：“一道残阳铺水中，半江瑟瑟半江红”。这两句写得极好，因为它不但写出斜阳，连江上的微风，也在“瑟瑟”两字中，表现出来了！
    车窗的另一面，不是长着碧绿庄稼的整齐的田地，便是长着上千盈百的杏树，桃树，橘柑树，橄榄树的山坡上的果园。陌上花开，风景如画。在这片丰饶美丽的土地上的居民，是使人艳羡的！
    但是，昨天早晨，我在翻阅罗马“中东和东方学院”送给我们的一本意大利摄影画册，读到上面的序言，里面有：西西里岛，四面被海中海所围抱，也被希腊人，腓尼斯人，撒拉逊人聚居过，被德国人，法国人，西班牙人占领过……西西里岛上，曾是罗马帝国的军队骨干的农民，失去了他们的自由，在重利盘剥之下，他们丧失了土地，又被招募成为一支无地产的农奴队伍。地主住在城市里，只在夏天，才到他的田庄上来避暑，朝代更迭，土地易主，而直到今天，在意大利土地上辛苦劳动的，都不是土地的主人！
    这是多么悲惨的境遇！这个意大利靴尖上的足球，在外来的统治者脚上，踢来踢去，虽然在文化艺术上遗留了些精美的宫殿和教堂的建筑，里面都有最精致的宝石嵌镶的图案，和颜色鲜艳神态如生的壁画，而当地的农民生活，却永远停留在半封建半开化的状态之中。
  “四海无闲田，农民犹饿死”的惨状，在这里是还存在的！
    在罗马的一个晚餐会上，意大利最著名的诗人卡罗·勒维坐在我的旁边。他滔滔不断地告诉我，在意大利南部，尤其是西西里一带，农民的受压迫被剥削的生活。意大利北部的工业，是比较发达的，而南部的资源，却从未被开发过，于是南部饥饿失业的队伍，就成群地被招送到北方去作工，痛苦流离，成了他们千百年来的命运！
    当诗人说这些话的时候，神情是激动的，眼光是悲愤的，使我的回忆中的西西里的水光山色，蒙上了一层阴沉的暗影！我又回忆到在岛上的一个小市镇——巴格里亚——的农民欢迎会上，另一位诗人卜提达，向我们致了最热烈的欢迎词。卜提达是巴格里亚市穷苦人民的儿子，他用西西里方言写诗，强烈地揭露了当地人民的黑暗生活。他送给我一本他的诗集：“面包就是面包”的法文译本，上面有卡罗·勒维写的序，说卜提达以钢铁般的坚强洪壮的声音，叫出了岛上人民的不幸。可惜我不懂得法文，只好等将来请人读给我听了。
    广大的人民是广阔的天空，人民的诗人就该像天空下透明的大海，它永远忠实地反映出天空的明暗阴晴，呼叫出人民的苦乐和希望。这样，他的诗里才有颜色，才有感情。勒维和卜提达都是大海般的诗人，我们应该向他们学习。
    今天是复活节，一早醒起，就听到从四面传来的悠扬而嘹亮的钟声。罗马城里，大大小小有五百多座教堂；登高望时，金色，绿色，灰色的圆顶，在丛树中层层隐现。这几天来，罗马街上，尤其是商店的橱窗里，洋溢着节日的气氛，金彩辉煌的巧克力做成的大鸡蛋，到处都是。今天上午出去走了一走，因为明天要到佛劳伦斯去，先给你们发出这封信，罗马的古迹，等以后再谈吧！
    今夜罗马大雷雨，电光闪闪，雷声大得像巨炮一般。现在祖国已是早晨，小朋友们正走在上学的路上，向你们珍重地说声早安吧！
              你的朋友　冰心
          1958、4、6夜，意大利、罗马
