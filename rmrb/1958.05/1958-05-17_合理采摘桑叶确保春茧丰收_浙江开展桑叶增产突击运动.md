　　Rationally Picking Mulberry Leaves to Ensure a Bumper Spring Cocoon Harvest
    Zhejiang Launches a Mulberry Leaf Production Increase Campaign
    (Our Dispatch) The Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee convened a telephone conference on the 8th, requiring all silkworm-producing areas to immediately launch a mulberry leaf production increase campaign centered on mulberry tip picking and rational leaf harvesting.
    It is estimated that Zhejiang's mulberry leaf production this spring will increase by 10% to 15% compared to the same period last year; the province's spring silkworm rearing plan has been completed; silkworm hatching is also more uniform than in previous years, and silkworms are generally developing normally. There are conditions for striving for a bumper spring cocoon harvest this year. However, judging from the current situation, there are also some problems in silkworm production: the original plan was to increase spring leaf production by 30%, but many areas have failed to meet the planned requirements, and there are still imbalances between regions, and the trend of mulberry leaf tension has begun to appear. The main reason is that some areas were affected by the late frost and cold wave in late March, resulting in a poor germination rate of mulberry trees this year. In addition, the recent cloudy, rainy, and low-temperature weather has affected the normal growth of mulberry leaves.
    In order to strive for increased mulberry leaf production and ensure a bumper spring cocoon harvest, the Provincial Party Committee has put forward three measures:
    First, in terms of increasing mulberry leaf production, we must comprehensively carry out mulberry tip picking, rational leaf harvesting, and continue to strengthen mulberry garden fertilization and cultivation management. Tip picking means removing the tender tips of mulberry branches to allow nutrients to fully enrich the leaf quality of existing mulberry leaves, increase the leaf size, and increase mulberry leaf production. All areas where silkworms are still developing before the major sleep stage should carry out tip picking, a three-day blitz to ensure that every mu and every plant is tip picked.
    Second, continue to implement the rapid silkworm rearing method, resolutely eliminate late-sleeping silkworms, sick silkworms, and small silkworms, prevent silkworm diseases, rationally store mulberry leaves, and save mulberry leaves.
    Third, we must do a good job in mulberry leaf allocation on the basis of increased mulberry leaf production. Leaders at all levels in silkworm-producing areas should have special personnel to grasp the situation of mulberry leaves and organize allocation in a timely manner. All localities and communes should establish a comprehensive perspective of mutual support and common production increase in mulberry leaf allocation.
    The Provincial Party Committee also emphasized: Key silkworm-producing counties, districts, townships, and agricultural cooperatives should immediately organize a mass campaign to quickly implement mulberry leaf production increase measures. In the implementation process, special attention should be paid to doing a good job in ideological mobilization, overcoming the various right-leaning conservative ideas of some cadres and the masses in the face of natural disasters, boosting morale, and striving for advancement. We must debate and act at the same time, seize the time, and if we can do it one day earlier, we will have one more point of certainty in increasing production.

### 合理采摘桑叶确保春茧丰收  浙江开展桑叶增产突击运动

　　合理采摘桑叶确保春茧丰收
    浙江开展桑叶增产突击运动
    本报讯　中共浙江省委8日召开电话会议，要求蚕区各地立即开展一个以桑叶摘芯、合理采桑为中心环节的桑叶增产突击运动。
    浙江今春桑叶估计可比去年同期增产10％到15％；全省计划饲育春蚕已完成了发种计划；蚕种孵化也比往年齐一，蚕儿一般发育正常。争取今年春茧丰收是有条件的。但是从目前情况看来，蚕桑生产也存在着一些问题：原来计划春叶增产三成，但是许多地区达不到计划要求，并且地区之间还存在不平衡的现象，桑叶紧张的苗头已开始出现。其主要原因是部分地区受到3月下旬晚霜与寒流侵袭的影响，以致今年桑树的发芽率差。加上近来阴雨低温，影响桑叶的正常生长。
    为争取桑叶增产，确保春茧丰收，省委提出了三项措施：
    第一，增产桑叶方面，要全面开展桑叶摘芯、合理采叶和继续加强桑园施肥培育管理。摘芯就是把桑条新梢嫩尖摘去，使养分充实现有桑叶的叶质，增大叶片，增产桑叶。凡是现在蚕儿发育尚在大眠以前的地区，都要搞摘芯，突击三天，做到亩亩摘芯，株株摘芯。
    第二，继续贯彻快速养蚕法，坚决淘汰迟眠蚕、病蚕和小蚕，防止蚕病，合理贮藏桑叶，节省桑叶。
    第三，要在增产桑叶的基础上做好桑叶调剂工作。蚕区各级领导应有专人掌握桑叶情况，及时组织调剂。各地各社在桑叶调剂上应树立互相支援，共同增产的全面观点。
    省委还强调指出：重点产蚕桑的县、区、乡和农业社要立即组织一个群众性的突击运动，把桑叶增产措施迅速贯彻下去。在贯彻中要特别注意做好思想发动工作，克服部分干部和群众在自然灾害面前的各种右倾保守思想，鼓足干劲，力争上游。做到边辩论，边行动，争取时间，能早一天干，就多一分增产把握。
