Wheat Harvest Proverbs

　　Wheat harvest has five busy tasks: cutting, hauling, sunning, threshing, storing.
　　Hauling to the threshing ground is only half the job, it only counts when it's in the granary.
　　Wheat harvest has two fears: sunny weather, rainy weather. (Note 1)
　　Cut at 80% maturity, harvest at 100%; cut at 100% maturity, harvest at 80%. (Note 2)
　　(1) Sunny weather and wind dry the wheat, easily causing the kernels to fall off. "Rainy weather" refers to overcast and rainy days.
　　(2) "Cut at 80% maturity," the "80%" refers to the wheat's degree of ripeness.
