    In the Villages of Big Character Posters
    Our Correspondents Du Daozheng, Zhang Shikui, Chen Rijin

    Leaving Sihui county seat and heading northwest for more than twenty li, crossing the yellow Sui River, the few small villages scattered along the bank are the Happiness Cooperative. One day in late May, when we arrived in the village, the farmers were happily writing and discussing big-character posters. The cooperative cadre who led us to see the big-character posters said that these big-character posters for rectification and cooperative consolidation had a huge impact, shaking everyone. The reporters also felt that for thousands of years, the selfish and self-interested traditional habits and moral concepts left to the farmers by the old society were being fiercely destroyed by a revolutionary tide.

    Speaking Out Garden

    We saw several "Speaking Out Gardens" hosted by cooperatives and teams. Tall walls were covered with colorful big-character posters. These big-character posters included three- or two-word maxims, catchy folk songs, and attractive cartoons. The big-character posters contained very sharp criticisms, as well as enthusiastic praises and commendations. Cooperative member Li Lunwen used the local folk song form in a big-character poster to criticize Chen Sanzai's misbehavior: "Happiness Cooperative member Chen Sanzai, hanging around lazily avoiding work. Everyone gets the same amount of grain, a reasonable distribution without deviation. But last year he made trouble with the unified purchase and sale, spreading rumors saying there was no grain..." After exposing Chen Sanzai's illegal acts of deceiving the government and selling grain coupons, he then wrote: "Unified purchase and sale is for construction, oppose extravagance and waste of grain, grain use should be planned, use miscellaneous grains for feeding pigs and chickens... Work hard for three years, be determined to do it, people's lives will be happy."

    The Speaking Out Garden is democratic. Cooperative members can express their opinions freely, allowing criticism, as well as defense and counter-criticism. Several cooperative members attached drawings criticizing Ji Wumei, saying that she relied on her husband's income, was lazy, and lay at home all day sleeping, acting like a hooligan. After reading these big-character posters, Ji Wumei admitted that the seedlings were not planted to standard and was willing to correct it, but said that she slept because she was sick, not lazy, and would never wear the hooligan label. Later, she also asked someone to write a big-character poster, held it with both hands, applied thick paste, and stuck it firmly on the exhibition, making what she thought was a satisfactory explanation.

    Big Character Posters at the Doorstep

    In front of cooperative member Li Binghua's house, six or seven new big-character posters on green paper were posted again today. Two of them praised him, saying that after being criticized, he had changed from lazy to diligent. His old mother and young sister greeted us just as we sat down, and Li Binghua happened to return from work in the fields. After we explained our purpose, he happily narrated the story of the more than ten big-character posters posted at his doorstep. Li Binghua's family joined the cooperative, but his father was a self-employed laborer who castrated pigs and chickens. Li Binghua thought about learning this skill to make money, so he always stayed at home and didn't go to work. A while ago, when the cooperative members were working hard day and night for production, he hid in a dark room in the depths of the courtyard lifting bricks to practice his hand strength, laying the foundation for learning to castrate pigs. Therefore, when the big blooming and free airing began, big-character posters criticizing him were posted at his doorstep. He couldn't understand it and tore down two big-character posters. This angered the masses and attracted more big-character posters. His mother and sisters wanted him to learn to castrate pigs, but also felt he was a bit lazy, so they took the opportunity to persuade him to listen to everyone, and work hard. He thought about it for several days, and also felt that he had shortcomings, wrote a big-character poster examining his shortcomings, arranged his time for cooperative labor and practicing castration skills, and became diligent.

    Broken Boat Complains

    "I used to be strong and energetic, and I did a lot of work for the cooperative, helping the cooperative with transportation, replacing a lot of labor. But when I was handed over to Deputy Director Huang Lan for safekeeping, my fate took a turn for the worse: I was left in the pond year after year, ignored, exposed to wind and rain and sun, so that now I am full of holes, incomplete, and can no longer contribute to the cooperative's transportation. I hope to complain through this exhibition, to be able to save my life and restore my original shape." This is a big-character poster posted on a broken boat. Cooperative cadres said that this kind of big-character poster with text and objects is most popular with cooperative members. It is the most accessible, the easiest to understand, and the most touching. This boat was solid three years ago, but now it is so damaged that anyone who sees it will feel distressed and will have a righteous anger towards Huang Lan's behavior of not cherishing collective property. Along with this broken boat, there are also thirty or forty other big-character posters with objects attached, all of which are very eye-catching.

    Young Painter

    Many big-character posters are accompanied by cartoons. Some of them seem to be from the same hand. They are grand in scale and full of imagination. Cooperative cadres said that this person is called Chen Guoquan, and he has drawn fifty or sixty of them in half a month.

    Chen Guoquan is eighteen years old, and a child of a poor peasant family. Last summer, he joined the cooperative's production before finishing the sixth grade at the village primary school. This time, a cooperative member wrote a big-character poster criticizing production team leader Chen Yuansheng, asking Chen Guoquan to draw some pictures. The original text of this big-character poster was: "Chen Yuansheng, watching the fish pond steals fish to eat, watching the ducks also eats duck eggs." Chen Guoquan waved his pen and drew a snake below, sticking out its tongue at a chicken. Words were written in the picture, forming a painting of "Truly raising a snake to eat chickens." Everyone who saw it said, it hits the nail on the head!

    A Storm

    Cooperative member Li Zaojiao couldn't help laughing as she recalled the storm caused by a big-character poster.

    Li Zaojiao is a competitive, capable, and often praised female production team leader. But that morning, she was carrying a hoe out the door when she ran into several children who laughed and shouted at her: "Your family is on the big-character poster too!" Hearing this, Li Zaojiao hurriedly put down her hoe and ran to the "Speaking Out Garden." A literate person told her that her son Huang Muyou had been criticized, saying that when he came back from school on vacation, he didn't participate in cooperative labor and spent all day squatting in small restaurants talking nonsense. Li Zaojiao looked up and saw her son, looking like a hooligan, drawn on the big-character poster. She was very ashamed, and cried and cursed on the spot, tearing the big-character poster to shreds with two "chi chi" sounds. When she returned home, her heart was in a mess, she couldn't eat or sleep.

    The deputy director of the township women's federation found out and came to Li Zaojiao. The deputy director asked her: "Zaojiao, this is rectification and cooperative consolidation, isn't it a good thing that people are posting big-character posters about your son?" Li Zaojiao got even angrier: "I don't want this good thing!" Saying that, she became sad again. The deputy director of the women's federation persuaded her for a long time, comforting and explaining, before the anger in her heart subsided.

    The next day, the third day, more and more big-character posters were posted in the "Speaking Out Garden." Writing about this, drawing about that, many cooperative members' various selfish acts and wasting public property were criticized in big-character posters. Li Zaojiao slowly understood at this time: Oh! So that's what writing big-character posters is like! Everyone writes, everyone gets an education, isn't it all for the sake of the cooperative. Some people have been criticized so harshly, they can take it, I'm too petty to let this little thing bother me.

    Later, the cooperative members rewrote the torn big-character poster for her, and she no longer cried or made a fuss. When talking to reporters about this story, she kept laughing and saying: The criticism is right! If there are shortcomings, they must be changed!

    在大字报的村庄
    本报记者　杜导正　张仕楷　陈日晶
    出四会县城，往西北走二十多里，渡过黄色的绥江，岸边星星点点的几个小山庄便是幸福社了。5月下旬的一天，我们到村里的时候，农民们正在兴高彩烈地书写大字报，谈论大字报。带领我们参观大字报的社干部说，这些整风整社的大字报影响大极了，它震动着每一个人。记者也确实感到：几千年来，旧社会遗留给农民的自私自利的传统习惯，道德观念正被一股革命的潮流猛烈地摧毁着。
    鸣放园地
    我们看了几处社和队主办的“鸣放园地”，高大的墙壁上，贴满了五光十色的大字报。这些大字报，有三言两语的警句，也有上口的民歌，诱人的漫画。大字报有十分尖锐的批评，也有热情洋溢的歌颂和表扬。社员李论文就这样在大字报上用当地的民歌形式，对陈三仔的错误行为进行了批判：“幸福社社员陈三仔呀，吊二郎当懒出勤呀。粮食人人同一样呀，合理分粮无偏差呀。巨（他）在旧年闹统销呀，大放谣言说无粮呀……。”他揭发了陈三仔欺瞒政府，变卖粮票的犯法事实之后，接着又写道：“统购统销为建设呀，反对铺张浪费粮食呀，用粮应该有计划呀，喂猪喂鸡用杂粮呀……苦战三年坚决干呀，人民生活乐洋洋呀。”
    鸣放园地上是民主的。社员们可以各抒己见，允许批评、也允许申辩和反批评。几个社员附上图画批评了纪五妹，说她依赖丈夫的收入，懒出勤，整日躺在家里睡大觉，活像个二流子。春耕时出勤了，却把秧苗插得乱七八糟。纪五妹看了这些大字报，承认秧苗插得不合规格，愿意改正，但睡觉是因为有病，不是懒惰，死也不戴二流子的帽子。以后也托人写了一张大字报，双手拿着，抹了浓浓的浆糊，结结实实地贴在展览会上，作了她认为是满意的解释。
  家门口的大字报
    社员李炳华住屋的门前，今天又新贴了六七张新的绿色粉连纸的大字报。两张是表扬他的，说他经过批评以后，已经由懒变勤了。他的老母亲和年青的妹妹招呼我们刚刚坐下，李炳华正好从田间收工回来。我们说明来意，他很高兴地叙述了他家门口张贴十多张大字报的故事。李炳华的家入了社，但是他的父亲却是做阉猪、阉鸡的个体劳动者。李炳华思量着学会这门手艺好赚钱，因此老是呆在家里不出勤。前一段社员披星戴月地大闹生产，他却躲在院子深处一间黑房里举砖头，练手力，给学阉猪算底子。因此大放大鸣一起，批评他的大字报贴到他家的门口了。他思想不通，将两张大字报撕掉了。这激怒了群众，招来了更多的大字报。他的母亲和姊姊、妹妹愿意他学阉猪，但也嫌他懒些，这时趁机会，劝他听听大家的话，好好劳动。他思量了好几天，也觉得自己有缺点，写了检查缺点的大字报，安排好社的劳动和练阉猪本领的时间，人变得勤快了。
    破艇诉苦
    “我原是身强兼力壮，为社做过不少工作，帮助社里运输，代替了不少劳动力。独是交到黄兰副主任手保管，我的命运就倒了霉：终年累月把我放在池塘，不加理睬，任由风吹雨淋和日晒，使到我现在周身是孔，体态不全，不能再为社的运输出力。希望通过这次展览来诉苦，能够挽回我的性命，恢复我的原形。”这是贴在一艘破船上的大字报。社干部说，这种有文字有实物的大字报，最受社员欢迎。它最通俗，最好懂，最能打动人心。这艇三年前是结结实实的，现在坏得不像样子，谁看了都会觉得心疼，都会对黄兰这种不爱惜集体财产的行为产生正当的愤怒。和这只破艇摆在一起附有实物的大字报还有三四十张，都是很引人注意的。
    青年画家
    许多大字报附了漫画。其中有一些似乎出自一人的手笔。它气魄大，富有想像力。社干部说，这个人叫陈国全，半个月，已画了五六十张了。
    陈国全十八岁，是一个贫农的孩子。去年夏天，他在乡里小学没读完六年级，参加了社的生产。这回，有个社员写了一张批评生产组长陈元盛的大字报，请陈国全画上点图画。这张大字报的原文是：“陈元盛，睇（管）鱼塘偷鱼吃，睇鸭也吃鸭蛋”。陈国全挥笔一画，就在下面画了一条蛇，伸出舌头向着一只鸡。图中写上字，构成一幅“真是养蛇吃鸡”的画。谁看了，都说，一针见血啊！
    一场风波
    社员李灶娇，跟我们回忆起一张大字报引起的风波，禁不住笑起来了。
    李灶娇是个好强、有本事、常受夸奖的女生产队长。可是那天清早，她扛着锄头出门，碰上几个小孩冲着她笑嚷：“你家也上了大字报啦！”李灶娇一听，急忙放下锄头奔到“鸣放园地”去。识字的人告诉她说，她儿子黄木有被批评了，说他读书放假回来，不参加社的劳动，成天蹲在小馆子里说闲话。李灶娇抬头一看，她的儿子，一副二流子像，画在大字报上。她很惭愧，当场又哭又骂，嗤嗤两下把那大字报撕得粉碎。回到家来，心里乱腾腾的，饭吃不下，觉睡不着。
    乡里的妇联副主任知道了，跑来找李灶娇。副主任问她：“灶娇，这是整风整社嘛，人家贴你儿子的大字报，还不是为他好？”李灶娇更火了：“我不要这个好！”说着又伤心起来。妇联副主任好歹劝了她老半天，又安慰又解释，她心头的气才消下来。
    第二天，第三天，“鸣放园地”贴的大字报越来越多啦。写这个，画那个，许多社员各种自私、浪费公共财产的缺点都被大字报批评起来了。李灶娇这时慢慢的明白过来了：哦！写大字报原来是这个样！人人写，人人受教育，还不都是为了社。有的人挨了那么厉害的批评，人家受得了，我这么点心事，吃不下，也太小气了。
    后来，社员们给她补写上被撕掉的那张大字报，她再不哭不闹了。和记者谈到这段故事的时候，她还不断地笑着说：批评的对！是缺点，就得改嘛！
