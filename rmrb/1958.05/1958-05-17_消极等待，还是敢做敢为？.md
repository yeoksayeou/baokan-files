　　Passive Waiting or Daring to Act?

    Expediting the production of large quantities of chemical fertilizers to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production is an important issue of current concern to all the people.

    Over the past eight years, the Party and the government have made tremendous efforts to restore and develop the chemical fertilizer industry. In 1957, chemical fertilizer production increased 28 times compared to 1949, with an average annual increase of 53%, exceeding the growth rate of any capitalist country. However, the foundation of China's chemical fertilizer industry is still weak, while agriculture's need for chemical fertilizers is increasing year by year. According to calculations, to initially meet the needs of China's agriculture, 30 million tons of chemical fertilizer must be produced annually, while only 800,000 tons were produced last year.

    There is too little chemical fertilizer, what should be done? People hold two completely different attitudes towards this question. One is that whenever they think of chemical fertilizer, they expect the construction of modern chemical fertilizer plants, believing that there is no other way. Of course, the construction of modern technological standard chemical fertilizer plants is necessary, and in fact is being stepped up. However, the construction of such chemical fertilizer plants cannot be accomplished overnight. It takes more than three years to build a synthetic ammonia plant with an annual output of 75,000 tons, and requires a large amount of investment, and the product cost is also relatively high.

    The other attitude is the opposite: relying on the masses, self-reliance, and using indigenous methods to solve difficulties in a timely manner. Fengjie has set an example in this regard. They used indigenous methods such as soaking, filtering, and boiling to produce a batch of chemical fertilizers with very little investment, and the raw materials are almost free of cost. Among them, the nitrogen content of ammonium sulfate has approached the level of national first and second-class products. This county can produce 8,000 to 10,000 tons of various chemical fertilizers this year. If four Fengjie counties appear in each province, the national chemical fertilizer production can be doubled this year.

    Fengjie County's experience in producing chemical fertilizers by indigenous methods is worth popularizing everywhere. It has the four major advantages of being more, faster, better, and more economical, and is a new way for China to accelerate the development of the chemical fertilizer industry. Its equipment is simple, operation is easy, and raw material sources are wide. Wherever sulfur is produced, ammonium sulfate can be extracted as a byproduct, and wherever coal is burned, ammonium bicarbonate can be recovered from the exhaust gas, and even every household can produce it. Although its recovery rate is still very low now, a small amount added up becomes a remarkable figure nationwide.

    Fengjie County's achievements are not limited to its economic value; more importantly, it has broken people's mysterious notions about manufacturing chemical fertilizers. Fengjie County's conditions are not superior. It only has three laboratory technicians with secondary education, seven or eight worker-turned-technicians, and new workers who have just laid down their hoes. It was this group of people who, without inviting engineers or adding any sophisticated instruments, researched one after another the ways to produce chemical fertilizers by indigenous methods. What is the reason for this? The Fengjie County Committee of the Communist Party of China summarized this work by saying: The Party has given us the principle of self-reliance, diligence and thrift in running enterprises, and doing more with less money. With this principle, coupled with the creative labor of the masses, and the leadership's in-depth experimental fields, all difficulties can be overcome.

    All this tells us that we should treat construction undertakings with this attitude: not sticking to conventions, but boldly creating; not waiting passively, but relying on ourselves.

　　消极等待，还是敢做敢为？

    尽快生产大量的化学肥料，以适应农业生产大跃进的需要，是当前全民关注的一个重要课题。
    八年来，党和政府在恢复和发展化学肥料工业方面已经做了极大的努力，1957年化肥产量比1949年增加二十八倍，平均每年递增53％，超过了任何资本主义国家的增长速度。但是，我国化肥工业的基础毕竟是薄弱的，而农业对化肥的需要则一年比一年增加。据计算，要初步满足我国农业的需要，每年要生产三千万吨化肥，而去年才生产八十万吨。
    化肥太少了，怎样办？对这个问题，人们持有两种截然不同的态度。一种是每想到化肥，就指望建设现代化的化肥工厂，认定除此之外，别无他路可走。当然，建设现代技术标准的化肥工厂是需要的，事实上也正在加紧建设。但是，建设这样的化肥工厂不是一朝一夕可以办到的。建成一座年产七万五千吨的合成氨厂，需要三年以上的时间，而且要投入大量的资金，产品成本也比较高。
    另外还有一种与上面相反的态度：依靠群众、自力更生、用土办法及时解决困难。奉节在这一方面树立了榜样。他们以泡一泡、滤一滤、熬一熬这种土里土气的办法，制成了一批化学肥料，投资很少，原料几乎可以不计成本。其中硫酸铵的含氮量已接近国家一、二级品的水平。这个县今年便可以生产八千至一万吨各种化肥。如果每个省出现四个奉节县，今年全国的化肥产量就可以翻一番。
    奉节县土法制造化肥的经验是值得各地普遍推广的，它兼备多快好省四大优点，是我国加速发展化学肥料工业的新途径。它的设备简单，操作容易，原料来源广阔。凡是产硫磺的地方，都可以附带提取硫酸铵，凡是烧煤的地方，都能从废气中收回炭酸氢铵，甚至家家户户都能生产。虽然它的回收率现在还很低，但积少成多，全国加起来就是一个了不起的数字。
    奉节县的成就还不限于它的经济价值，更重要的是打破了人们对待制造化肥的神秘观念。奉节县的条件并不优越，仅有三个具有中等文化水平的化验员，七、八个工人出身的土技师，和刚放下锄头的新工人。就是这班人马，既没请来工程师，也没有添置什么精密仪器，土法制造化肥门路一个接一个被钻研出来。这是什么道理？中共奉节县委总结这一段工作时说：党给了我们自力更生，勤俭办企业，少花钱多办事这条原则。有了这个原则，加上群众的创造性劳动，和领导深入搞试验田，什么困难都克服了。
    这一切告诉我们，应该以这样的态度对待建设事业：不墨守陈规，而是大胆创造；不消极等待，而是自力更生。
