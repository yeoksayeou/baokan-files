    Major Efforts to Strive for Peace
    After the successful conclusion of the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the member states of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, representatives of the fraternal parties and governments of the Soviet Union and Eastern European socialist countries held another meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization in Moscow. In addition to the representatives of the Warsaw Treaty member states, representatives of the People's Republic of China also attended the meeting as observers. The meeting of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance formulated more perfect guidelines for strengthening economic cooperation among socialist countries and promoting further economic upsurge in the socialist camp. The countries participating in the meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization reached a complete consensus on the international situation and common tasks in the struggle for world peace and security. This is another vivid manifestation of the ever-increasing solidarity of socialist countries in all aspects.
    The Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Organization issued a declaration. In this declaration, the participating countries solemnly declared that they would do their utmost to unremittingly defend the cause of peace and strive to prevent a new war, and proposed that a non-aggression treaty be concluded with the member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to open a good start for the international situation to move towards trust and peaceful cooperation between countries. The meeting also decided that the Warsaw Treaty member states would continue to reduce their armed forces by 419,000 people in 1958. The meeting also endorsed the Soviet Union's recent decision to withdraw its troops from Romania and to reduce the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary by another division in 1958. The declaration of the meeting and the above-mentioned decisions are new efforts and contributions made by the Warsaw Treaty member states to strive for world peace and ease international tensions. This sincere effort by the Warsaw Treaty member states to strive for peace is a great encouragement to the struggle for peace by peace-loving people of all countries.
    The Warsaw Treaty Organization, established in 1955, is an organization for maintaining peace. The eight countries participating in the treaty are all socialist countries. They all regard the struggle for peace as their primary task. Therefore, from the day the treaty was concluded, it became a powerful force for ensuring peace in Europe and promoting peaceful cooperation between countries. The Warsaw Treaty member states have consistently advocated the establishment of a European collective security system to replace opposing military blocs, in order to eliminate tensions in Europe. These countries have also continuously taken practical measures to promote the settlement of disarmament issues. Since 1955, the Warsaw Treaty member states have unilaterally reduced their armed forces by 2,477,000 people. Since the meeting of representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries was held in Moscow last November, the Warsaw Treaty member states, together with other socialist countries, have greatly strengthened their efforts to strive for peace. The Soviet Union has repeatedly suggested to Western countries that a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries be held to eliminate the "Cold War" and stop the nuclear arms race, and in order to promote the realization of this goal, it has successively unilaterally announced the continued reduction of armed forces and the cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests; the Polish government has proposed the establishment of a nuclear-free, hydrogen weapon-free, and rocket weapon-free zone in Central Europe; the German Democratic Republic has proposed the establishment of a German Confederation to restore German unification in order to end the abnormal situation of Germany's division into two parts. These peace initiatives of the Warsaw Treaty member states have been widely welcomed and supported by world opinion. From these facts, peace-loving people of all countries have further recognized the sincere desire of socialist countries to strive for peace, and have actively responded to the peace initiatives of socialist countries, thereby forming a powerful movement for peace since this year.
    The efforts of socialist countries to strive for peace are not because they are afraid of imperialist aggression, on the contrary, it is because they are full of confidence in the socialist cause and the forces defending peace. The current balance of power in the international situation is not that the West wind has overwhelmed the East wind, but that the East wind has overwhelmed the West wind. The socialist camp has surpassed the imperialist camp, whether in terms of the political aspect of popular sentiment, the speed of economic development, or in terms of several important scientific and technological aspects, and is continuing to surpass it with greater advantages. Since this year, the rapid economic development of socialist countries and the launching of the Soviet Union's third satellite weighing more than 1,300 kilograms have shown that the socialist forces are continuing to overwhelm the imperialist forces. Joining the socialist countries in their efforts to strive for peace are the nationally independent countries of Asia and Africa, and the people of various countries in Western Europe and the Americas; in addition, countries pursuing a neutral policy also play a certain positive role in the struggle for peace. It can be seen that the forces striving for peace are far more powerful than the forces for war.
    However, people cannot ignore the frantic actions of imperialism in expanding its arms and preparing for war. This action is being carried out with increasing intensity. The ruling groups of imperialist countries, headed by the United States, ignoring the peace aspirations of the people of all countries, stubbornly refuse the peace proposals put forward by socialist countries, and try their best to delay and obstruct the convening of a summit meeting of Eastern and Western countries. It is particularly noteworthy that while socialist countries are implementing reductions in the number of armed forces and the Soviet Union has unilaterally announced the cessation of nuclear weapons tests, the North Atlantic Group is doubling the armed forces under the command of the US commander-in-chief of the group, arming West German forces with atomic weapons, and deploying US nuclear warhead rocket launch sites on the territory of many countries in Western Europe, while the United States and Britain are continuously conducting nuclear weapons tests on islands in the Pacific Ocean. This practice can only intensify international tensions and the arms race. Not only that, the US aggressive forces also ordered military aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs to carry out provocative flights towards the Soviet border; the United States and some of its partners are trying to use force to interfere in the internal affairs of Indonesia and Lebanon to suppress the increasingly vigorous national independence movements in Southeast Asia and the Near and Middle East. Of course, this kind of provocative and aggressive activity by the United States cannot intimidate anyone, but people cannot but be vigilant about the crazy nature of these activities.
    The ruling groups of the United States and other imperialist countries insist on continuing to pursue their "Cold War" and "policy of strength," which does not indicate their strength, but on the contrary, it is a struggle in their declining process. The "Cold War" and "policy of strength" of imperialist countries have been repeatedly hit and frustrated in the post-war years, and now they are also in an extremely difficult economic situation. The head of the imperialist group, the United States, has fallen into the storm of an extremely serious periodic economic crisis; the economies of other major countries in the capitalist world have either stagnated or entered an economic crisis. Contrary to the booming economic situation in the socialist camp, the prospects for the capitalist world economy are bleak. In this situation, the mass movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin American countries against US aggression are continuing to rise. The recent successive emergence of the Lebanese people's struggle against the Eisenhower Doctrine and the powerful demonstrations by the people of various Latin American countries protesting Nixon's visit are not accidental. At the same time, the Algerian people and the people of other North African countries are vigorously developing their struggle against France's armed suppression policy and against US interference in North Africa. The fascist crisis in France is also weakening France's position as a major power. In short, troubles are constantly emerging in the imperialist world. The ruling groups of imperialist countries, headed by the United States, are facing a situation that makes them worried and uneasy.
    The ruling groups of the United States and other imperialist countries are attempting to get rid of the difficulties they face by continuing to implement the "policy of strength" of expanding arms and preparing for war. This is a futile delusion. Expanding arms and preparing for war cannot alleviate the economic crises that have arrived and are arriving; it will only arouse more resolute resistance from peace-loving people of all countries to this crazy policy. If imperialism actually moves from preparing for war to launching a war, the result can only be its own destruction. Therefore, the road of the "policy of strength" is fundamentally impassable.
    What peace-loving people of all countries yearn for is peaceful coexistence and the elimination of the "Cold War." In order to satisfy this urgent desire of the people of all countries, socialist countries have made unremitting efforts in this regard, and are continuing to make greater efforts. The Warsaw Treaty member states' decision to continue to reduce their armed forces, to withdraw Soviet troops from Romania and reduce Soviet troops in Hungary, and to propose the signing of a non-aggression pact with the member states of the North Atlantic Group are all practical actions taken by socialist countries to strive for peace and ease international tensions. These actions will undoubtedly help ease the tense situation of armed confrontation in Europe. However, it must be pointed out that actions to ease international tensions cannot only come from the socialist countries unilaterally. If the North Atlantic Group countries, especially the United States, have at least a minimum of peace aspirations, they should take the same actions.
    The Warsaw Treaty member states have made major efforts to strive for peace and ease international tensions, which will be warmly welcomed and supported by peace-loving people of all countries. The Chinese people fully support the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the relevant decisions. Our people have always believed that in the struggle to build socialism and defend peace, our interests are completely consistent with those of the Soviet Union and other socialist brother countries. We are deeply convinced that the declaration of the Warsaw Treaty member states and the various decisions they have made will greatly enhance the strength of the people of all countries to strive for peace, and will also greatly strengthen the strength of the entire socialist camp in the struggle for peace.

### 争取和平的重大努力

    争取和平的重大努力
    苏联和东欧社会主义国家的兄弟党和政府的代表，在完满地结束了经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议之后，又在莫斯科举行了华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议。除了华沙条约缔约国的代表之外，中华人民共和国的代表作为观察员也参加了这个会议。经济互助委员会的会议为加强社会主义国家的经济合作、促成社会主义阵营进一步的经济高涨制定了更加完美的方针；参加华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议的各国，则对国际局势和在争取世界和平和安全的斗争中的共同任务，取得了完全一致的看法。这是社会主义国家在各方面的团结一致，在不断加强和巩固的又一生动的表现。
    华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议发表了一项宣言。在这个宣言中，参加会议的各国庄严地宣称，它们将竭尽全力不懈地捍卫和平事业和为制止新战争而斗争，并且建议同北大西洋公约成员国缔结互不侵犯公约，以便为国际局势走向国与国之间的信任和和平合作的方向打开一个良好的开端。会议并决定，华沙条约缔约国在1958年继续裁减武装部队四十一万九千人；会议还赞同了苏联在最近期间从罗马尼亚撤出驻军和在1958年把驻匈牙利的苏联军队再减少一个师的决定。会议的宣言和上述的各项决定，是华沙条约缔约国为争取世界和平和缓和国际紧张局势而作出的新的努力和贡献。华沙条约缔约国争取和平的这种真诚努力，是对各国爱好和平人民争取和平斗争的一个巨大的鼓舞。
    在1955年成立的华沙条约组织，是一个维护和平的组织。参加这个条约的八个国家，都是社会主义的国家。它们都把争取和平的斗争看作是自己的首要任务。因而，从这个条约缔结的那一天起，它就成为保障欧洲和平和促进各国间的和平合作的一个强大力量。华沙条约缔约国一贯主张建立欧洲集体安全体系，来代替对立的军事集团，以消除欧洲的紧张局势。这些国家还不断地采取实际措施来促进裁军问题的解决。从1955年起，华沙条约缔约国已单方面地裁减了武装部队二百四十七万七千人。自从去年11月在莫斯科举行了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议之后，华沙条约缔约国同其他社会主义国家一道，更大大地加强了争取和平的努力。苏联曾一再向西方国家建议举行东西方国家的最高级会议，以消除“冷战”和停止核军备竞赛，并且为了促成这个目标的实现，先后单方面地宣布继续裁减武装部队和停止原子武器、氢武器的试验；波兰政府提出了在中欧建立无原子武器、氢武器和火箭武器地区的建议；德意志民主共和国为结束德国分裂为两部分的不正常状况，提出了建立德意志邦联以恢复德国统一的建议。华沙条约缔约国的这些和平倡议，都得到了世界舆论的广泛欢迎和支持。各国爱好和平的人民从这些事实中，已进一步认清了社会主义国家争取和平的真诚愿望，并积极地响应社会主义国家的和平倡议，从而形成了今年以来的争取和平的强大运动。
    社会主义国家争取和平的努力，并不是由于它们害怕帝国主义侵略势力，相反的，是由于它们对社会主义事业和保卫和平的力量充满着信心。目前国际局势中的力量的对比，不是西风压倒了东风，而是东风压倒了西风。社会主义阵营不论是在人心所向的政治方面，经济发展速度方面，而且是在若干重要的科学技术方面，都已超过了帝国主义阵营，并且还在继续以更大的优势胜过它。今年以来，社会主义阵营各国经济的飞跃发展，苏联第三个重达一千三百多公斤的卫星的上天，都表明了社会主义力量正在继续压倒帝国主义力量。同社会主义国家一道为争取和平而努力的，还有亚非的民族独立国家、西欧和美洲大陆的各国人民；此外，奉行中立政策的国家，对争取和平的斗争也起着一定的积极的作用。由此可见，争取和平的力量是远远地比战争势力为强大。
    但是，人们不能因此而忽视帝国主义扩军备战的疯狂行动。这种行动正在变本加厉地进行着。以美国为首的帝国主义国家的统治集团，不顾各国人民的和平愿望，一味地拒绝社会主义国家所提出的和平建议，并竭力拖延和阻挠东西方国家最高级会议的召开。特别值得注意的是，在社会主义国家实行裁减武装部队人数、苏联单方面宣布停止核武器试验的同时，北大西洋集团却要把归这个集团的美国总司令所率领的武装部队增加一倍，以原子武器武装西德部队，并且要在西欧许多国家的领土上设置美国的核弹头火箭发射场，同时美英两国还在太平洋的岛屿上连续进行核武器试验。这种做法只能加剧国际紧张局势和军备竞赛。不止如此，美国侵略势力还命令携带着氢弹的军用飞机向苏联国境进行挑衅性的飞行；美国和它的一些伙伴并竭力想以武力干涉印度尼西亚和黎巴嫩的内政，来镇压日益蓬勃发展的东南亚和中近东的民族独立运动。当然，美国的这种挑衅和侵略活动并不能吓倒任何人，可是，对于这些活动的疯狂性质，人们却不能不加以警惕。
    美国和其他帝国主义国家统治集团坚持继续奉行它们的“冷战”和“实力政策”，这并不表示它们的强大，相反的，却是它们在日趋没落过程中的一种挣扎。帝国主义国家的“冷战”和“实力政策”在战后的年代中，已经一再遭受打击和挫败，现在它们在经济上也处于极端困难的境地。帝国主义集团的头子美国，已经陷于一场极端严重的周期性经济危机的风暴之中；资本主义世界的其他主要国家的经济或者已经陷于停滞或者已经进入了经济危机。同社会主义阵营各国经济欣欣向荣的情况恰恰相反，资本主义世界经济的前景是一片漆黑。在这种情况下，亚非地区和拉丁美洲国家反对美国侵略的群众运动正在继续高涨。最近期间，黎巴嫩人民反对艾森豪威尔主义的斗争和拉丁美洲各国人民抗议尼克松访问的强大示威的相继出现，并不是偶然的。与此同时，阿尔及利亚人民和北非其他国家人民反对法国的武装镇压政策、反对美国干涉北非的斗争也在蓬勃发展。法国的法西斯危机也正在削弱着法国作为一个大国的地位。总之，在帝国主义的世界里，乱子正层出不穷。以美国为首的帝国主义国家的统治集团正面对着使它们愁苦不安的局面。
    美国和其他帝国主义国家的统治集团企图以继续执行扩军备战的“实力政策”，来摆脱它们所面临的困难，这是一种徒然的妄想。扩军备战不能缓和已经到来和正在到来中的经济危机，它只会激起各国爱好和平人民对这种疯狂政策的更加坚决的反抗。如果帝国主义竟然从备战走向发动战争，其结果只能是它们自己的毁灭。所以，“实力政策”的道路是根本走不通的。
    各国爱好和平的人民渴望的是和平共处和消除“冷战”。社会主义国家为了满足各国人民的这种迫切愿望，曾在这方面作了不懈的努力，并且还在继续作更大的努力。华沙条约缔约国决定继续裁减它们的武装部队，决定从罗马尼亚撤出苏联驻军和减少在匈牙利的苏联驻军，并且建议同北大西洋集团成员国签订互不侵犯公约，这都是社会主义国家争取和平和缓和国际局势的实际行动。这些行动无疑将有助于缓和欧洲的武装对立的紧张形势。但是，必须指出，缓和国际紧张局势的行动不能仅来自社会主义国家单方面。北大西洋集团国家，特别美国，如果具有起码的和平愿望，它们就应该采取同样的行动。
    华沙条约缔约国为争取和平和缓和国际紧张局势作了重大的努力，它将得到各国爱好和平人民的热烈欢迎和支持。中国人民完全支持华沙条约缔约国的宣言和有关的各项决定。我国人民一向认为，在建设社会主义和保卫和平的斗争中，我们同苏联和其他社会主义兄弟国家的利益是完全一致的。我们深信，华沙条约缔约国的宣言和它们作出的各项决定将大大增强各国人民争取和平的力量，从而也将大大加强整个社会主义阵营在争取和平斗争中的力量。
