Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 6th. Northwest provinces (autonomous regions) recently held an industrial collaboration conference in Xi'an, and closely cooperated to solve many problems in the current development of local industries. The heads of local industrial departments discussed and agreed that through mutual cooperation and support, local industries themselves could solve the manufacturing of more than 20 kinds of production equipment. They would also mutually supply 29 kinds of raw materials urgently needed for the development of local industries, mutually train and allocate more than 10 kinds of technical workers, and exchange more than 10 kinds of existing technical data.

Each region learned from the strengths of others to solve the equipment problems in developing local industries. Shaanxi Province, with its relatively strong mechanical processing capacity, will manufacture the required lathes, generators, electric motors, transformers, steam boilers, and papermaking equipment for other provinces. Gansu Province will try to manufacture or produce small quantities of alcohol, sugar production, fertilizer and other equipment, and supply as much as possible to provinces that cannot currently manufacture them. Various regions should give some of the steel allocated by the national plan to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will transfer 8,000 tons of self-produced steel that does not meet current needs in terms of specifications to support Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.

Shaanxi Province, with its textile industrial base, will build a medium-sized cotton textile factory on behalf of Gansu Province, which has never had a cotton textile industry, and support technical cadres in textile, maintenance, and operation. Gansu has a woolen textile factory and will provide four woolen textile engineering technicians to Shaanxi and Qinghai provinces, which want to develop the woolen textile industry, and train woolen textile workers and junior technicians for them. Xinjiang, with its silk reeling industrial base, will also provide some silk reeling technicians to various parts of the Northwest.

In terms of mutual supply of resources, Qinghai can supply more than 1,500 tons of borax, blister copper, crude lead, and lead-zinc ore to Shaanxi and Gansu this year. Resources in the adjacent areas of the two provinces will also be mutually exchanged and supplied through cooperation.

This collaboration conference also further studied the long-term collaboration issues of various provinces, and according to the industrial characteristics of various regions, studied the division of labor in cultivating the technical forces needed by various provinces in the future.

    西北各省区协作发展工业
    据新华社西安6日电　西北各省（自治区）最近在西安举行的工业协作会上，密切协作解决了当前发展地方工业中的许多问题。各地工业厅负责人讨论议定，经过互相配合支援，地方工业本身就能解决二十多种生产设备的制造工作，还互相供应二十九种发展地方工业急需的原材料，彼此代培训和调配十几种技术员工，交换十多种现成的技术资料。
    各地取长补短，以解决发展地方工业的设备问题。机械加工力量较大的陕西省要给其他省制造所需车床、发电机、电动机、变压器、蒸汽锅炉和造纸等设备。甘肃省将要试制或少量生产的酒精、制糖、化肥等设备，尽量供应一些给目前还不能进行制造的省份。各地要把国家计划分配给的一部分钢材给陕、甘两省。新疆维吾尔自治区要把自产的因规格不合现时需要的八千吨钢材，调出支援陕、甘两省。
    有纺织工业基础的陕西省要代从来没有棉纺工业的甘肃省，筹建一座中型棉纺织厂，并支援纺织、保全、运转技术干部。甘肃有一座毛纺织厂，就给要发展毛纺织工业的陕西、青海两省支援四个毛纺工程技术人员，并代为培训毛纺工人和初级技术员。有缫丝工业基础的新疆，也要为西北各地输送部分缫丝技术人员。
    在资源互相供应方面，青海今年就可供应陕、甘硼砂、粗铜、粗铅及铅锌矿石一千五百多吨。在两省毗邻区的资源也互通有无，协作供应。
    这次协作会议，还进一步研究了各省长远的协作问题，并且根据各地工业特点研究了分工培养将来各省需要的技术力量问题。
