　　Stepping Out of the Ivory Tower
　　Chen Zhiyan

　　Using biogas as a power source is not a new discovery. Many years ago, people understood its mysteries. Compared to nuclear fission, the energy of biogas is even more insignificant. From this point of view, biogas does not seem to be anything particularly advanced.

　　Why talk so much about biogas utilization in this atomic age? Isn't this a bit "backward"? If we are going to carry out a technological revolution, shouldn't we use the most advanced technology in the world! Some people may have this idea.

　　This idea has some merit, but it is fundamentally wrong.

　　Compared to atomic energy, the biological energy of biogas is indeed a backward thing. However, using biogas to transform heavy manual labor into skillful mechanical operations, and to change dim soybean oil lamps into clean and bright biogas lamps, is a kind of progress. It can be seen that advanced and backward are not absolute, and backward things can also be advanced under certain conditions. Otherwise, why are so many farmers in Hubei, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and Gansu so interested in biogas? The reason is that under today's conditions, biogas can improve productivity and improve people's lives.

　　To carry out a technological revolution, it is necessary to learn and adopt all the advanced technologies in the world, which is beyond doubt. However, this cannot be done in a day or two, or a month or two. New technologies for modern large-scale production cannot be immediately popularized to every cooperative and every farmer's home. However, biogas can be popularized to every rural area and every farmer's family in a very short period of time. At the same time, the development of biogas stations can promote the technological revolution, so as to eventually drive our country on the steed of modern large-scale production. There is no doubt that when our productivity develops to a certain height, when thousands and thousands of hydroelectric power stations and thermal power stations have been popularized throughout the country, one day we will not use biogas as a power source, but today we will not relax the opportunity to use it.

　　In the large-scale development of local industries, some comrades are still not very interested in some "indigenous," small and very small, seemingly "backward" equipment, and always feel that it is not satisfying enough. The reason is that they still lack a correct understanding of the relationship between popularization and improvement, and of the objective law of development from elementary to advanced. These comrades may not have stepped out of the ivory tower of ideology, and their minds and spirits have not been completely liberated. Or they have only stretched out half of their bodies from the ivory tower, and have not come out completely, so they do not understand or do not fully understand the current general trend of the world.

　　Today's era is the most prosperous era of Marxist philosophy. Fully applying dialectics and materialism in practical work can help us get out of the ivory tower of thought, make our understanding conform to reality, and thus greatly accelerate the progress of our socialist construction.

　　走出象牙之塔

    利用沼气作为动力，这并不是什么新的发现。多年以前，就有人懂得其中的奥妙。和原子核分裂来比，沼气的能量更是微不足道的。从这一点上来说，沼气似乎也并不是什么特别先进的东西。
    为什么要在这个原子时代来大谈其沼气利用呢？这不有点儿“落后”吗？既然要进行技术革命，就应当利用世界上最先进的技术呀！也许有人有这种想法。
    这种想法有一点道理，然而基本上是不对的。
    比起原子能来，生物能的沼气确是一种落后的东西。然而利用沼气，能够把笨重的手工操作变成灵巧的机械操作，能够把昏暗的豆油灯改变为又干净又明亮的沼气灯，则又是一种进步。可见先进和落后并非是绝对的，落后的东西在一定的条件下也可以是先进的。要不然为什么湖北、广东、浙江、甘肃许许多多地方的农民对沼气这样感兴趣呢？原因就是沼气在今天的条件下，它能够提高生产力和改善人们的生活。
    要进行技术革命，必需学习和采用世界上一切先进的技术，这是毋庸置疑的。然而这却不是一天两天、一个月两个月可以办到的。现代化大生产的新技术也不是马上可以普及到每一个合作社、每一户农民家中去的。然而沼气却可以在极短的时间内普及到每一个农村和每个农民的家庭中。同时，沼气站的发展，又可以促进技术革命的进行，以便最终把我们的国家驾在现代化的大生产的骏马上。没有疑问，当我们的生产力发展到一定高度，当成千成万个水电站、火电站已经普及全国的时候，终有一天我们会不用沼气作为动力来源的，然而今天我们却不放松利用它的机会。
    在大办地方工业中，有些同志迄今对于一些“土”造的、小型和小小型的、看起来似乎“落后”的设备，总不大感兴趣，总觉得不过瘾。其原因就是对普及和提高的关系、对于由初级向高级发展的这个客观规律，还缺乏正确的认识。这些同志很可能是还没有走出意识形态的象牙之塔，思想上、精神上还没有完全解放。或者只从象牙之塔里伸出了半截身子，还没有全部出来，因而不了解或不完全了解当今的天下大势。
    当今的时代，是马克思主义哲学的最兴盛的时代，在实际工作中充分运用辩证法和唯物论，可以帮助我们走出思想的象牙之塔，使我们的认识符合于实际，这样就可以大大加速我国社会主义建设事业的进程。
