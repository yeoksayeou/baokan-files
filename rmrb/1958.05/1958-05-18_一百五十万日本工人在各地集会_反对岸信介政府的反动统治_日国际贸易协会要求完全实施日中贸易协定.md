Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 17th: More than 1.5 million Japanese workers held massive rallies simultaneously in 69 cities across the country today, protesting the Kishi Nobusuke government's suppression of labor union movements and promotion of reactionary education systems, and demanding the protection of the working class's right to live.

　　This large-scale rally, organized by the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), is the second event for the Japanese working class to celebrate "May Day."

　　In Tokyo, more than 14,000 workers held a central rally at Hibiya Park. The assembly passed a resolution amidst enthusiastic applause, demanding the overthrow of the Kishi Nobusuke government and the establishment of a democratic government.

　　The resolution condemned Kishi Nobusuke for committing serious war crimes during World War II and for now attempting to turn Japan into a forward base for the United States to launch an atomic war. The resolution pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke verbally opposes nuclear weapons testing, but in reality advocates bringing nuclear weapons into Japan and preparing to equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons. The resolution also strongly protested Kishi Nobusuke's plot to revise the constitution and implement the "single-seat constituency" system. The resolution called on all Japanese workers to unite and oppose the reactionary rule of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

　　The assembly also passed a resolution opposing the Kishi Nobusuke government's illegal suppression of workers and demanding the abolition of the "performance appraisal" system that controls teachers. The resolution also expressed support for the coal miners who are persisting in their struggle to win wage increases, until they achieve victory.

　　The declaration adopted by the assembly stated that Japanese workers will concentrate all their efforts on launching struggles to protect their right to live, oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's promotion of a reactionary education system, promote improved relations between Japan and other countries, and strive for the victory of democratic forces in Japan in the general election.

　　Yoshitaro Hirano, Director-General of the Japan Peace Committee, Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Kazuo Kamiama, representative of the Communist Party, and Kanzo Uchiyama, Director-General of the Japan-China Friendship Association, all participated in the assembly and spoke at the meeting.

　　In his speech, Uchiyama pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's erroneous attitude of hostility towards China has placed Japan-China relations in a worrying situation. He pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's policy of subordinating to the United States and being hostile to China runs counter to the world situation, will make Japan an orphan in Asia, and may involve Japan in the vortex of the United States launching an atomic war.

　　After the assembly, all participants held a demonstration.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 16th: The Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade passed a statement at its fifth annual meeting today, demanding that the Kishi Nobusuke government normalize Japan-China trade and restore Japan-China diplomatic relations.

　　The assembly also adopted the association's work guidelines for this year. The guidelines stipulate that promoting the full implementation of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement is the association's main task for this year. The association will cooperate with the Japan-China Trade Promotion League of Diet members and the Japan-China Import and Export Association, and call on various organizations to jointly launch a movement to promote the implementation of the Japan-China Trade Agreement. The guidelines also stipulate that efforts should be made to completely abolish the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM)'s "embargo" on socialist countries. All participants unanimously agreed that in order to promote Japan-China trade based on the principles of equality and mutual benefit, it is necessary to simultaneously promote friendly relations between the two countries.

　　The assembly received congratulatory messages from Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and international trade promotion organizations from the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, East Germany, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

　　一百五十万日本工人在各地集会
　　反对岸信介政府的反动统治
    日国际贸易协会要求完全实施日中贸易协定
    新华社17日讯　东京消息：一百五十多万日本工人今天在全国六十九个城市中同时举行声势浩大的集会，抗议岸信介政府镇压工会的运动和推行反动的教育制度并且要求维护工人阶级的生活权利。
    这次由日本工会总评议会所组织的大规模集会，是日本工人阶级庆祝“五一”劳动节的第二次活动。
    在东京，一万四千多工人在日比谷公园举行了中央奋起大会。大会在全场的热烈掌声中通过决议，要求打倒岸信介政府，建立民主政府。
    决议谴责岸信介在第二次世界大战期间犯过重大的战争罪行，而现在又企图把日本变为美国发动原子战争的前进基地。决议指出，岸信介在口头上说反对试验核武器，但是实际上却主张把核武器运进日本，并且准备用核武器装备日本“自卫队”。决议并且强烈抗议岸信介阴谋修改宪法和实施“小选举区”制度。决议号召全体日本工人团结起来，反对岸信介政府的反动统治。
    大会还通过决议，反对岸信介政府非法镇压工人，要求撤销控制教职员的“勤务评定”制度。决议还表示支持正在为争取提高工资而坚持斗争的煤矿工人，一直到他们获得胜利为止。
    大会通过的宣言表示，日本工人将集中全力展开斗争，维护生活权利，反对岸信介政府推行反动的教育制度，促进改善日本同各国的关系，并且争取日本民主力量在大选中获胜。
    日本和平委员会理事长平野义太郎、社会党书记长浅沼稻次郎、共产党代表神山和日中友好协会理事长内山完造等都参加了大会，并且在会上讲了话。
    内山在讲话中指出，由于岸信介敌视中国的错误态度，使日中两国关系陷入令人忧虑的局面。他指出，岸信介的这种屈从美国敌视中国的政策是和世界形势背道而驰的，将使日本成为亚洲孤儿，并且有可能使日本卷进美国发动原子战争的漩涡。
    大会结束后，全体与会者举行了示威游行。
    新华社16日讯　东京消息：日本国际贸易促进协会在今天举行的第五届会员大会上通过一项声明，要求岸信介政府使日中贸易正常化和恢复日中邦交。
    大会还通过今年度的协会工作方针。方针规定，促使完全实施第四次日中贸易协定是协会今年度的主要任务，协会将同日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟和日中输出入协会合作，呼吁各团体联合展开促使实施日中贸易协定的运动。方针还规定要为完全撤销巴黎统筹委员会对社会主义国家的“禁运”而努力。全体与会者一致认为，为了根据平等互利原则促进日中贸易，必须同时促进双方的友好关系。
