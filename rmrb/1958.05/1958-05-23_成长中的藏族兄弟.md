    New Soldier Jianzan
    At a commendation meeting held by the Panchen Guard Battalion, I met a Tibetan new soldier named Jianzan.
    Comrade Jianzan is from Aoburenzong. He is twenty-four years old this year and voluntarily enlisted in the army at the end of 1956. From the day he joined the army, he has always maintained high spirits and has consistently been active in his work and study. In 1957, he was awarded the Third Class Merit, and this year he was selected as a nonvoting delegate to the Tibet Military Region Active Elements Representative Conference.
    Under the Party's patient education, Jianzan quickly accepted new things. He took notes carefully in every political class. He also often read books and newspapers to enrich himself. Therefore, he has a relatively good understanding of the Party's nature, tasks, and policies in Tibet, and can help other comrades.
    His body is relatively weak, but he never shows weakness in construction. In the morning, when it was more than ten degrees below zero, he took the lead in jumping into the cold mud to carry soil, and joked and sang to encourage everyone's work mood.
    In more than a year of military training, Comrade Jianzan has always been actively studying and practicing diligently. After the Chinese textbooks were translated, many unfamiliar military terms still hindered the correct understanding of the textbook content. He often sacrificed his rest time to ask people to translate and guide him on a sentence or an action point, and repeatedly practiced each action. After he learned it himself, he taught it to new soldiers.
    After joining the army, Jianzan was assigned as a Tibetan language teacher for Group A of the Second Company. He realized that this was a glorious task assigned to him by the organization, so he always carried out his voluntary teaching work conscientiously. With his patient education and enthusiastic help, all the comrades in the group removed the label of illiteracy, and 80% of the students could read newspapers and write general letters.
    When I visited him, he said: "The changes in Tibet after liberation and the new atmosphere that is emerging everywhere have enlightened me. I deeply realize that under the wise leadership of the Party, Tibet, like other parts of the motherland, will definitely enter a beautiful socialist society. Therefore, I will try my best to pursue progress and do my part for the construction of Tibet!"

    Automobile Driver Gama
    Under the cultivation of the Party, the Tibetan people had their first batch of Tibetan automobile drivers in 1957. This is Tibetan driver and Communist Youth League member Gama driving a car.

    Carriage Worker Zhenzhu
    On the main road in the western suburbs of Lhasa, you can see such a person every day: tall, with dark red skin, and a sincere smile on his face. He is Comrade Zhenzhu, a Tibetan carriage worker and Second Class Merit recipient at the "August 1st" Farm.
    Speaking of Comrade Zhenzhu, no one in the "August 1st" Farm doesn't know him. He was originally from Lhasa City and joined the farm in 1956. From the day he started working, he personally experienced that the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are the great benefactors of the Tibetan people. He often said to people: "The People's Liberation Army treats me better than my relatives."
    His work has always been active. He transports manure from Lhasa city to the farm two or three times a day, often missing meal times, but he has never complained. Last year, during the autumn harvest in Liewuzong, he suffered from dysentery. He was yellow and thin, his appetite decreased, and he had no strength in his body. The leaders and comrades advised him to rest, but he still insisted on working. Every morning, before others got up, he had already harnessed the carriage and went to the field; in the evening, when others had already finished work, he was still loading highland barley in the field. He said: "In the morning and evening, the highland barley ears are moist, and the grains are not easy to fall off when loading the car." This is how he loves his work and cares about the country's property everywhere. This kind of action moved everyone on the farm.

    Auto Repair Worker Renqin
    Renqin never dreamed that the hand that used to whip yaks would repair cars he had never even seen before. However, in the new life brought by the Communist Party, the things he never dreamed of became reality.
    Renqin is now a worker in the automobile repair factory of the Logistics Department of the Tibet Military Region. From the day he put on his work clothes, he has been working diligently, because he always remembers the instructions of the Party branch secretary: "Be a good member of the first generation of the Tibetan working class." He secretly made up his mind to set an example for the Tibetan working people. Thanks to the care of the organization and the patient help of the Han workers, he mastered all disassembly techniques in less than three months. In just one year, he could understand political and technical lessons.
    When the Great Leap Forward began in the whole factory, Renqin was very excited. He said: "Although my technology is not high, I will do my best to make our country surpass Britain, which once ran rampant in our Tibet, in industry as soon as possible."
    On the first day of the Great Leap Forward, he exceeded the target. In the past, three people disassembled one car a day, but on this day, he only brought one assistant and disassembled one car in less than eight hours. He carried away the brake drums that two people used to carry. During breaks, he always didn't want to leave; he had to be urged to eat every time; at eleven o'clock in the evening, he was still working hard, and the leaders repeatedly urged him to rest, but he didn't leave, saying: "I am a Tibetan, doesn't building Tibet let me contribute more?"
    Because of his active work, he achieved more, faster, better, and more economical results in production, and the comrades unanimously elected him as an advanced element in the Great Leap Forward, and the factory leaders approved him as a Third Class Merit recipient. When people saw his photo and model deeds on the honor roll, they all gave a thumbs up and said: "He is really a good Tibetan worker!"

    成长中的藏族兄弟
    新战士坚赞
    在一次班禅警卫营举行的贺功会上，我认识了一位名叫坚赞的藏族新战士。
    坚赞同志家住敖布仁宗，今年二十四岁，1956年底自愿应征入伍。从入伍那天起，他总是保持着饱满的情绪，在工作和学习上一贯表现积极，1957年被评为三等功臣，今年又被选为出席西藏军区积极分子代表大会的列席代表。
    在党的耐心教养下，坚赞接受新事物很快，每次上政治课他都很用心做笔记。他还常常阅读书报来充实自己。所以他对党的性质、任务和党在西藏的政策都比较了解，并能帮助其他同志。
    他的身体比较瘦弱，但在营建中从不示弱。在零下十几度严寒的早晨，带头跳到冰冷的泥水中挑土，还谈笑唱歌鼓励大家的劳动情绪。
    在一年多来的军事训练中，坚赞同志始终是积极钻研、勤学苦练的。汉文教材经过翻译后，有许多陌生的军事术语仍阻碍着对教材内容的正确理解，他常常为一句话或一个动作要领，牺牲休息时间去请人翻译和指导，并反复练习每个动作。他自己学会了，还教给新战士。
    入伍后坚赞被指定为二连甲组藏文教员，他认识到这是组织交给他的光荣任务，因而始终认真地进行着义务教学工作。全组同志在他的耐心教育与热情帮助下，全部摘掉了文盲的帽子，80％的学员可以阅报并能写一般的书信了。
    当我去访问他时，他说：“西藏解放后的变化以及正在各处出现的新气象启发了我，我深刻地认识到在党的英明领导下，西藏和祖国各地一样，一定会进入美好的社会主义社会。因此，我要竭力追求进步，为西藏的建设尽一分力量！”

    汽车司机嘎玛
    在党的培养下，西藏人民在1957年有了第一批藏族汽车驾驶员。这是藏族驾驶员、共青团员嘎玛正在驾驶汽车。

    马车工人珍珠
    在拉萨西郊的大路上，每天都可以看见这样一个人：高高的个子，黑里透红的皮肤，脸上现出诚挚的笑容，他就是“八一”农场的藏族马车工人、二等功臣珍珠同志。
    提起珍珠同志，在“八一”农场里没有人不知道。他原是拉萨市人，1956年参加农场工作。从他参加工作那天起，他就切身体会到共产党和解放军是藏族人民的大恩人，他常对人说：“解放军对我比亲人还好。”
    他的工作一贯积极，从拉萨市区运粪到农场，一天往返两三次，经常赶不上开饭时间，但从没有说过一句怨言。去年在列乌宗秋收时，他得了痢疾病，人又黄又瘦，饭量也减少了，全身没有一点力气，领导和同志们劝他休息，但他仍然坚持工作。每天清早，别人没起床，他就套好马车下地了；晚上别人已经收工了，他还在地里装青稞。他说：“早晨和晚上青稞穗一潮湿，在装车的时候颗粒不容易脱落。”他就是这样热爱自己的工作和处处关心国家的财产。这种行动感动了农场所有的人。

    汽车修理工人仁钦
    仁钦过去做梦也没有想到，拿着鞭子赶牦牛的手，会去修理以前见都没见过的汽车。然而，在共产党带来的新生活里，他梦想不到的事变成了现实。
    仁钦现在是西藏军区后勤部汽车修配厂的工人。从他穿上工作服那天起，就一直辛勤地劳动着，因为他时刻记着党支部书记的嘱咐：“要当好西藏第一批工人阶级中的一员”。他暗自下了决心，要给藏族劳动人民作出榜样来。由于组织上的关怀，汉族工人的耐心帮助，不到三个月，他就掌握了全部拆卸技术。才一年的光景，他就能听懂政治课和技术课了。
    在全厂大跃进开始时，仁钦心里激动得很。他说：“虽然我的技术不高，但也要尽最大的力量，使祖国在工业上早日超过曾在我们西藏横行过的英国”。
    跃进的第一天他就突破了指标。过去三人一天拆一台车，这天他只带一个助手，不到八小时就拆完一台车。两人抬的刹车鼓，他一人就扛走了。一到休息时间，他总是不愿离开；每次吃饭都要人催促；晚上十一点钟，他还在埋头干活，领导同志多次劝他休息也不走，他说：“我是西藏人，建设西藏就不让我多出点力吗？”
    由于他积极工作，在生产中作到了多快好省，同志们一致选他为跃进中的先进分子，厂领导批准他为三等功臣。当人们在光荣榜上看到他的照片和模范事迹的时候，都翘起大拇指说：“真是好样的藏族工人！”
