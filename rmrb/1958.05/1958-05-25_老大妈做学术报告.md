On the 22nd, Kunming held a fascinating lecture on the habits of rats, with the speakers being Yi Xiu, a 64-year-old Dai woman and model for eliminating the four pests, Wang Cuilan, a 57-year-old Han woman, and Fan Yongjing, a young Han man. The audience consisted of more than 40 senior intellectuals and technicians from Kunming's medical community.

That afternoon, on a field on the southern outskirts of Kunming, the speakers, carrying pickaxes, walked with the audience into a field of wheat that had just been harvested. Yi Xiu said as she walked: When we find a rat hole, how can we judge whether there are rats and how many rats there are from the various signs at the entrance? Now let's try it.

People came to a rat hole built in a sewage ditch. A few withered grasses remained at the entrance, and many of the green grasses beside the hole were bitten off. Yi Xiu said: Now the weather is very hot. If the rats haven't gone out to cool off, they must be in the hole making a nest for the soon-to-be-born baby rats. Rats don't use dry grass to pad their nests before giving birth. Fan Yongjing jumped into the sewage ditch, blocked the back hole with a clod of earth, and swung his pickaxe to dig the hole from the front. People stood on both banks, watching intently. The hole became deeper and deeper, and people's hearts became tighter and tighter. Suddenly, two fat rats jumped out of the edge of the pickaxe in panic. Their heads had just emerged when they were caught. People touched the fat belly of the female rat with their hands and estimated that more than ten baby rats would be born in another week.

In several other holes, four more rats were caught. Each time, the speakers' predictions were proven correct. The speakers also talked about how to feel the rat's tracks, footprints, and the rules of their appearances, where different kinds of rats like to live, the classification of rats, and so on.

Their rich knowledge of eliminating the four pests comes from long-term practice. Wang Cuilan has eliminated more than 110,000 rats and sparrows in the past eight years, averaging more than 40 rats and sparrows per day. Old woman Yi Xiu often travels around the villages and schools in Lianghe, Longchuan and other counties in the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, teaching methods of eliminating the four pests. Fan Yongjing actively eliminates the four pests and has been repeatedly named a model. This time, they came to Kunming to participate in the experience exchange meeting for eliminating the four pests and to share advanced experiences with representatives from the whole province.

The audience felt that they had gained a lot. The person in charge of the Kunming branch of the Chinese Medical Association told reporters: This is a new type of academic lecture. From this, we feel more urgently the importance of learning from local experts.

    老大妈做学术报告
    22日，昆明市举行了一次引人入胜的关于老鼠生活习性的讲演，主讲人是除四害模范六十四岁的傣族老大妈依秀、五十七岁的汉族大妈王翠兰和汉族青年范永镜。听讲的人有昆明医学界的四十多个高级知识分子和技术人员。
    这天下午，在昆明南郊的一块田边，主讲人扛着十字镐和听讲的人一起走进刚刚收割过的麦地里。依秀边走边说：当我们找到了一个老鼠洞的时候，怎样才能够从洞口的各种迹象，判断出有没有老鼠，和有多少老鼠呢？现在我们就来试试看。
    人们来到了一个筑在污水沟的老鼠洞前，洞口残留着几根枯草，洞旁的青草被咬断了许多。依秀说：现在天气很热，如果老鼠没有出去纳凉，就一定在洞里为即将出世的小老鼠做窝。老鼠不下儿是不用干草垫窝的。范永镜跳下污水沟，用土块堵住了后洞，抡起十字镐从前面挖起洞来，人们站在两岸聚精会神地看着，洞越挖越深，人们的心越扣越紧，蓦地两只肥大的老鼠从镐锋边惊惶地跳出来，它的头刚露出来就被捉住了。人们用手摸着那雌鼠肥大的肚子，估计再过一个星期就有十来只小鼠要出世了。
    在另外的几个洞里，又捉住了四只老鼠，每一次都证明主讲人的预测是正确的。主讲人还讲到了如何摸老鼠的行径、足迹、出没的规律，各种不同的老鼠喜欢住在什么地方，老鼠的分类等等。
    他们的除四害的丰富的知识是从长期的实践中得来的。王翠兰八年来消灭了十一万多只老鼠和麻雀，平均每天消灭四十多只鼠雀。依秀老大妈经常在德宏傣族景颇族自治州的梁河、陇川等县的村寨和学校里，巡回传授除四害的办法。范永镜积极除四害，多次被评为模范。她们这次是到昆明来参加除四害的经验交流会，向全省的代表传授先进经验的。
    听报告的人都觉得大有收获，中华医学会昆明分会的负责人对记者说：这是一种新型的学术讲演，从这里我们更迫切地感到向土专家学习的重要。　（新华社）
