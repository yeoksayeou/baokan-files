Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th – Under the open connivance of the Japanese Nobusuke Kishi government, which is colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, two Japanese thugs tore down the flag of the People's Republic of China hanging at the venue of the Chinese Stamp and Paper-cut Exhibition in Nagasaki City on May 2nd, and the Kishi Nobusuke government immediately released these two thugs. This barbaric act of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which disregards international law and connives with thugs to damage the national dignity of the People's Republic of China, is an intensified hostile action against the Chinese people after it succumbed to the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine the Fourth China-Japan Trade Agreement.

At 4:20 PM on May 2nd, two Japanese thugs named Kanto and Kiyoshi Ishibashi broke into the Chinese Stamp and Paper-cut Exhibition being held at the "Hamaya" Department Store in Nagasaki City and violently tore down the flag of the People's Republic of China hanging at the venue. At that time, members of the Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the organizer of the exhibition, immediately recovered the flag and immediately called the police to file a complaint. The Japanese police had to arrest the two thugs on the spot. However, the Japanese government authorities, which bear major responsibility for the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag, immediately released the two thugs on the evening of the same day. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs actually stated that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law would not apply to this incident, and that the two Japanese thugs would not be punished under the criminal law for damaging a foreign national flag.

Facts prove that the actions of these two thugs are part of the Kishi Nobusuke government's actions of succumbing to the Chiang Kai-shek clique and being hostile to the Chinese people. Prior to this incident, personnel from the Chiang Kai-shek clique's pseudo "embassy" in Tokyo had requested the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to remove the Chinese flag hanging at the exhibition venue. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs then agreed to negotiate with the Nagasaki City Government and "advised" the exhibition organizers to "take down the flag." In his "notice" to the Mayor of Nagasaki, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs actually believed that, under the current circumstances, it was "inappropriate" to hang the Chinese flag in Japan. At the same time, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's pseudo "consul" in Nagasaki made the same request to the person in charge of the exhibition through the Nagasaki City Government. After such unreasonable demands from the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Kishi Nobusuke government were strongly rejected by the person in charge of the Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, the incident of Japanese thugs insulting the Chinese national flag occurred.

When the Kishi Nobusuke government succumbed to the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique and openly undermined the Fourth China-Japan Trade Agreement, it openly stated that Japan did not recognize the right of Chinese commercial representative offices to hang national flags, and claimed that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law regarding the punishment of acts of damaging foreign national flags would not apply to the People's Republic of China. The incident of Japanese thugs insulting the Chinese national flag and the subsequent immediate release of these two thugs by the Japanese authorities irrefutably proves that the Kishi Nobusuke government had then deliberately publicly connived at actions to damage the Chinese national flag, and that this incident of damaging the Chinese national flag is the product of a conspiracy by the Kishi Nobusuke government in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out such hostile acts against the Chinese people.

After the incident of Japanese thugs insulting the Chinese national flag, the Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association has filed a lawsuit against the two thugs with the court and demanded that the Nagasaki City Police Department thoroughly investigate the background of this incident and punish the thugs in accordance with Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law.

At the same time, the Japan-China Friendship Association issued a statement on this incident, demanding that the Japanese government severely punish the relevant people who supported and instigated these two thugs to commit such atrocities. The statement also protested the Chiang Kai-shek clique's shameful interference in demanding the removal of the Chinese flag through the Japanese government. The statement pointed out that this behavior is a brutal act aimed at obstructing and undermining the urgent desire of the Japanese people to strengthen the friendly relations between the people of Japan and China and to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries, and is an illegal interference in Japan's internal affairs.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese people voluntarily hold the Chinese Stamp and Paper-cut Exhibition in Japan, and want to hang the Chinese national flag at the venue. This is the freedom and right of the Japanese people. This freedom and right cannot be violated by anyone.

### 岸信介政府勾结蒋匪集团  纵容暴徒侮辱我国旗

    岸信介政府勾结蒋匪集团
    纵容暴徒侮辱我国旗
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：在与蒋介石集团相勾结的日本岸信介政府的公然纵容下，两名日本暴徒5月2日扯下了悬挂在长崎市中国邮票和剪纸展览会会场上的中华人民共和国国旗，岸信介政府并且随即释放了这两名暴徒。岸信介政府这种蔑视国际法规，纵使暴徒损害中华人民共和国国家尊严的野蛮行为，是它屈从美国和蒋介石集团破坏第四次中日贸易协定以后对中国人民采取的变本加厉的敌对行动。
    5月2日下午四时二十分，有两个名叫关东和石桥清的日本暴徒闯进正在长崎市“滨屋”百货公司举行的中国邮票和剪纸展览会的会场，使用暴力扯下了悬挂在会场上的中华人民共和国国旗。当时，展览会的主办团体日中友好协会长崎分会的人员立即夺回了这面国旗，并且立即叫来警察提出控诉，日本警察不得不当场逮捕了这两名暴徒。但是，对侮辱中国国旗事件负有重大责任的日本政府当局随即在当天傍晚释放了这两名暴徒。日本外务省居然说，日本刑法第九十二条将不适用于这一事件，并且说，这两名日本暴徒将不会根据刑法按损坏外国国旗罪加以处罚。
    事实证明，这两个暴徒的行为是岸信介政府屈从蒋介石集团、敌视中国人民的行动的一部分。发生这次事件以前，蒋介石集团驻东京的伪“大使馆”人员曾经向日本外务省提出要求，要把悬挂在这个展览会会场上的中国国旗取下来。日本外务省随即答应同长崎市政府进行交涉，并且“劝告”展览会主办团体“取下这面国旗”。日本外务省在他给长崎市长的“通知”中，竟然认为，在目前的情况下，在日本悬挂中国国旗是“不适宜”的。同时，蒋介石集团的驻长崎的伪“领事”曾经通过长崎市政府向展览会的负责人提出了同样要求。在蒋介石集团和岸信介政府的这种无理要求遭到日中友好协会长崎分会负责人的严词拒绝以后，就发生了日本暴徒侮辱中国国旗的事件。
    岸信介政府在屈从美国和蒋介石集团公然破坏第四次中日贸易协定的时候，就曾经公开声明日本不承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗，并且声称日本刑法第九十二条关于损坏外国国旗的行为将加以处罚的规定不适用于中华人民共和国。这次发生日本暴徒侮辱中国国旗的事件和随后日本当局立即纵放这两名暴徒的情况无可辩驳地证明：岸信介政府当时就已经蓄意公开纵容进行破坏中国国旗的行动，而这次破坏中国国旗的事件正是岸信介政府勾结蒋介石集团策划这种敌视中国人民的阴谋的产物。
    在发生日本暴徒侮辱中国国旗的事件以后，日中友好协会长崎分会已经向裁判所对这两名暴徒提出控诉，并且要求长崎市警察署彻底查明发生这次事件的幕后背景，并且根据日本刑法第九十二条处罚暴徒。
    日中友好协会同时就这次事件发表声明，要求日本政府严厉处罚支持和教唆这两名暴徒干出这种暴行的有关人物。声明还抗议蒋介石集团通过日本政府要求取下中国国旗的可耻的干涉行为。声明指出，这种行为是想阻挠和破坏日本人民加强日中两国人民的友好关系和恢复两国邦交的迫切愿望的横暴行为，是对日本内政的非法干涉。
    声明指出，日本人民自愿在日本举行中国邮票和剪纸展览会，并且要在会场悬挂中国国旗。这是日本人民的自由和权利。这种自由和权利是任何人都不能侵犯的。
