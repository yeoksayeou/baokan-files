　　Consolidating and Improving Agricultural Middle Schools
　　Zhou Ze, Second Secretary of the CPC Yangzhou Prefectural Committee, Jiangsu Province
    Under the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee, our Yangzhou Prefecture established a total of 777 agricultural middle schools in April, averaging two schools per township, with more than 30,600 students. Most of the higher primary school graduates who had previously been unable to continue their education were admitted.

    Why were we able to establish so many agricultural middle schools in less than a month? This is due to the in-depth development of the nationwide rectification movement and the great leap forward in winter and spring production. The broad masses of farmers urgently demanded to learn politics, culture, science, and technology in order to continuously improve labor efficiency and accelerate the realization of the forty articles of the Agricultural Development Program. In recent years, a large number of higher primary school graduates who had been unable to continue their education were very young, and what they had learned in the past was far from enough to meet the needs of self-study of science and technology and production development. They urgently demanded to continue their studies. Agricultural middle schools cost very little, are close to home, offer a half-work, half-study program, and integrate learning with practice, which is even more popular with farmers. In addition, most areas are old liberated areas with a good tradition of mass education. Precisely because agricultural middle schools are oriented correctly, the masses have the desire and tradition to run schools, and the principles of "mass self-management, half-work and half-study, running schools diligently and thriftily, and serving production" were put forward, the enthusiasm of the broad masses for running schools surged once the Party issued a call and organized it. Agricultural middle schools blossomed "like flowers after a spring rain." Judging from the information reflected by various places, this kind of school is indeed deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. The broad masses of farmers reflected: "The Communist Party has a good program, agricultural middle schools are set up at the doorstep, half-work and half-study produces new people. Commune houses are classrooms, desks are carried from home; the gate is the blackboard, the field is the experimental field; knowledge is used in agricultural work, so that corn can grow a foot long. If we work hard for ten years, we can become agricultural experts; if you ask where we graduated from, it is our township middle school."

    After agricultural middle schools are generally established, the issue of consolidation and improvement has become the most concerning issue for all parties. Based on our short-term practical experience, roughly the following main issues need to be resolved:

    First, labor and study time must be properly arranged. Because agricultural cooperatives' production and income have reached or exceeded the level of middle peasants, the arrangement of labor and study time is relatively easy to solve. For students themselves who are full labor force, and for poor and lower-middle peasants whose families are temporarily poor and have little labor force, the arrangement of labor and study time is more problematic. If the labor and study time are not arranged properly, it will affect the labor income of the students' families and the students' peace of mind to study. According to the survey of the students' ages in Shijiaqiao Agricultural Middle School, 14-15 years old accounted for 16 percent, 16-17 years old accounted for 45 percent, 18-19 years old accounted for 30 percent, and over 20 years old accounted for 9 percent. These situations show that the arrangement of labor and study time is very important. How to arrange it? Read more books when less busy, read less books when very busy; read more books on rainy days, read less books on sunny days; during particularly busy seasons in agricultural work, such as wheat harvesting and planting and autumn harvesting and planting, a busy holiday of about one month each time can be given; in hot weather, it is suitable to get up early and work late, classes can be started later and dismissed earlier; in winter when the days are short, an alternating system can be implemented, one day for production and one day for studying. In short, each student with labor ability should spend two-thirds or three-fifths of their time each year engaging in agricultural labor, and generally rely on their own labor income to solve their study and living expenses, and some can appropriately subsidize their families. With the development of production, the improvement of labor efficiency, and the increase of members' income, study time can be appropriately increased in the future. We also plan to set up cultural and technical night schools in agricultural middle schools to meet the learning requirements of some young people and brigade and team cadres.

    Second, the difficulty of insufficient teachers must be solved and the quality of teaching must be improved. In terms of teachers, we mainly adopt the method of using local materials, mobilizing cadres who have been sent to lower levels with a certain cultural level, township and commune cadres, agricultural technical cadres, and junior and senior high school graduates who have returned to their hometowns to engage in production to serve as teachers, generally based on the principle of not separating from production, working while working, and teaching while teaching. This has several benefits: it can guarantee labor work point income and reduce the tuition burden of students; it can complete work tasks and squeeze out time for teaching; it can improve oneself through labor and combine with the local production reality to conduct teaching. We plan to set up a full-time teacher in agricultural middle schools with relatively more students this winter to preside over teaching affairs. Their salaries should not be too high, as long as they can maintain the general living standards of teachers. In terms of improving the quality of teaching, teachers should be encouraged to study diligently and improve themselves from work practice. The specific methods are: strengthening lesson preparation, seizing labor rest time and spare time, studying teaching materials, organizing experience exchange, listening to each other's classes, and learning from each other; and improving business guidance relations with teachers in nearby ordinary middle schools, and asking them to help answer some difficult questions when necessary. In the teaching process, we must also implement the "five more" requirements, organize more classroom discussions, study teaching methods more collectively, adopt more on-site teaching, organize more students to help each other learn, and pay more attention to students' understanding level. In order to solve the difficulty of insufficient teachers and improve the teaching level, we are preparing to start a short-term training class for teachers of agricultural middle schools immediately. The Provincial Party Committee has decided that Jiangsu Normal Colleges, Normal Junior Colleges, Agricultural Colleges, and Agricultural Junior Colleges will hold correspondence courses to train teachers for agricultural middle schools.

    Third, teaching must be closely integrated with current production. There are still some people who treat agricultural middle schools with old teaching views, inappropriately emphasizing the systematization of teaching materials, advocating mechanically moving a set of things from ordinary middle schools to agricultural middle schools, and even requiring agricultural middle schools to completely follow ordinary middle schools. They do not understand that running agricultural middle schools is to train a large number of young people into new farmers with socialist consciousness and a certain cultural and technical knowledge. Therefore, it is very important to establish the idea of "teaching closely integrated with the current production practice" among teachers. For example, when teaching agricultural knowledge courses, the teachers of Shijiaqiao Agricultural Middle School simply followed the teaching syllabus, starting from the introduction, and then talking about the cell walls and protoplasm of plants, etc. Students felt it difficult to understand and had many opinions. Later, according to the opinions of the Township Party Committee, the teachers boldly reformed and combined the agricultural knowledge courses with the production activities of agricultural cooperatives, successively teaching the field management of three wheat crops, prevention and control of diseases and insect pests, sweet potato warm bed seedling raising, and rice combined seedling ponds. While lecturing, they went to the fields for practice. Students felt that this kind of teaching was suitable for their level, easy to understand, and very practical. As soon as they returned to the cooperative, they practiced cultivating sweet potato seedlings and actively promoted it to the members, which was praised by parents, agricultural cooperatives, and production teams. According to the current situation, the four courses of agricultural middle schools (agricultural knowledge, politics, language, and arithmetic) can be completely combined with the local agricultural work center for teaching. Wherever the combination is good, the effect is good, and it begins to achieve a combination of the virtual and the real, and effectively serve production. With the continuous consolidation of agricultural middle schools and the continuous improvement of teaching level, we are also preparing to add physics and chemistry courses next year.

    Some of the methods mentioned above have been adopted, and some are being prepared for adoption. How effective they will be remains to be tested. We firmly believe that as long as the Party strengthens its leadership over agricultural middle schools, adheres to the mass line, constantly discovers problems, and constantly solves problems, agricultural middle schools can be consolidated and improved.

### 巩固和提高农业中学

　　巩固和提高农业中学
　　中共江苏省扬州地委第二书记　周泽
    我们扬州专区，在江苏省委的领导下，4月份共办了七百七十七所农业中学，平均每乡两所，有学生三万零六百多人，历届不能升学的高小毕业生大部分被吸收入学了。
    为什么在不到一个月的时间里，能够办起这么多的农业中学呢？这是由于全民整风运动的深入开展，冬春生产的大跃进，广大农民迫切要求学政治，学文化，学科学技术，以便不断提高劳动效率，加速实现农业发展纲要四十条。几年来，有一大批未能升学的高小毕业生，他们年龄很轻，过去学的东西还远远不能满足自学科学技术和生产发展的需要，他们迫切要求继续学习。农业中学花钱很少，靠近家门，半耕半读，学用一致，更为农民所欢迎；加上大部分地区是老解放区，原来就有群众办学的优良传统。正由于农业中学方向对头，群众有办学的要求和传统，又提出了“群众自办、半耕半读、勤俭办学和为生产服务”的原则，因此党一号召、一组织，广大群众办学的积极性就涌现出来，农业中学就“一夜春雨，满园花开”了。从各地反映的情况来看，这种学校，确实深得人心。广大农民反映说：“共产党，好章程，农业中学办上门，半耕半读出新人。社房当课堂，书桌自家扛；大门当黑板，田做试验场；知识用在农活上，好叫玉米尺把长。苦干干上十年整，农业专家能当上；若问毕业在那里，我们乡里中学堂。”
    农业中学普遍办起来以后，巩固和提高问题，就成为各方面最关心的问题；根据我们很短时间的实践过程，大体需要解决这样几个主要问题：
    第一、必须做到劳动和学习时间的妥善安排。因为，农业社的生产和收入已经达到或者超过中农水平，劳动和学习时间的安排，就比较容易解决。学生本人是全劳动力的，家境暂时贫苦而劳动力又少的贫农和下中农，劳动和学习时间的安排，问题就比较多一些。如果劳动和学习时间安排不当，就会影响学生家庭的劳动收入和学生本人的安心学习。根据施家桥农业中学学生年龄的调查，十四、五岁的占到百分之十六，十六、七岁的占到百分之四十五，十八、九岁的占到百分之三十，二十岁以上的占到百分之九。这些情况说明，劳动和学习时间的安排很重要。如何安排呢？小忙多读书，大忙少读书；雨天多读书，晴天少读书；农活特别紧张的季节，如麦收麦种和秋收秋种，可以各放一个月左右的忙假；热天适宜起早带晚干活，可以迟上课，早下课；冬天天时短，可以实行隔日制，一天生产，一天读书。总之，每年每个有劳动能力的学员，有三分之二或五分之三的时间，从事农业劳动，一般的靠自己的劳动收入，来解决学习和生活费用，有的还可以适当补助家庭。随着生产的发展，劳动效率的提高，社员收入的增加，学习时间将来可以适当增加。我们还准备在农业中学里，附设文化技术夜校，来满足一部分青少年和社队干部的学习要求。
    第二、必须解决师资不足的困难和提高教学的质量。在师资方面，我们主要采取就地取材，动员有一定文化水平的下放干部、乡社干部、农业技术干部，和回乡生产的初、高中毕业生担任教师，一般以不脱离生产为原则，一面劳动，一面工作，一面教学。这样做，有几个好处：既能保证劳动工分收入，又能减少学员的学费负担；既能完成工作任务，又能挤出时间进行教学；既能通过劳动提高自己，又能结合当地的生产实际进行教学。我们打算在今年冬季学生比较多的农业中学里，设一名专职教师，主持教务，他们的薪水不宜过高，只要能够维持教师的一般生活水平就行了。在提高教学质量方面，要鼓励教师刻苦钻研，从工作实践中提高自己，具体办法是：加强备课工作，抓紧劳动休息时间和课余时间，学习教材，组织经验交流，相互听课，相互学习；和附近的普通中学教师，搞好业务上的辅导关系，必要时请他们帮助解答某些疑难问题。在教学过程中，还要贯彻“五多”要求，多组织课堂讨论，多集体研究教学方法，多采用现场教学，多组织学生互助互学，多注意学生理解水平。为了解决师资不足的困难，和提高教学水平，我们准备马上开办农业中学师资短训班，省委已经决定江苏各师范学院、师范专科学校、农学院和农业专科学校，举办函授班，培养农业中学的师资。
    第三、必须做到教学与当前生产密切相结合。现在还有一部分人，用旧的教学观点，来对待农业中学，不适当地强调教材的系统化，主张把普通中学的一套东西，机械地搬到农业中学里来，甚至要农业中学向普通中学完全看齐。他们不懂得办农业中学，就是要把大量的青少年，培养成为具有社会主义觉悟的、有一定文化和技术知识的新农民。因此，在教师中确立“教学和当前生产实际紧密相结合”的思想，是很重要的。例如施家桥农业中学的教师，讲授农业知识课程时，单纯按照教学大纲进行，开始从序论讲起，接着讲植物的细胞壁、原生质等等，学生感到吃力难懂，意见很多。后来教师根据乡党委的意见，大胆革新，把农业知识课程和农业社生产活动一致起来，先后讲授了三麦田间管理，防治病虫害，山芋温床育苗，水稻合式秧池，一面讲课，一面到田间实习，学生认为这样教学，适合自己的水平，既容易理解，又很实惠；他们一回到社里，就实习培育山芋苗，积极向社员宣传，受到家长和农业社、生产队的赞许。根据目前情况来看，农业中学的四门课程（农业知识、政治、语文、算术），完全可以和本地农活中心结合起来进行教学；凡是结合的好的地方，效果良好，开始做到虚实并举，切实为生产服务。随着农业中学的不断巩固，教学水平的不断提高，我们明年还准备增加物理、化学两门课程。
    上面谈的这些办法，有的已经采用了，有的准备采用，到底效果如何，尚待试验。我们坚决相信，只要党加强对农业中学的领导，坚持走群众路线，不断发现问题，不断解决问题，农业中学是可以巩固和提高的。
