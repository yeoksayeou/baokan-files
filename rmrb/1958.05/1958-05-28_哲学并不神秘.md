    Philosophy is Not Mysterious
    The article "Let's All Learn a Little Philosophy" written by Comrade Pan Zinian, published on the seventh edition on April 18th, is a good article. Articles on philosophy are easily written in a dry and dull manner, but Comrade Pan Zinian's article flows smoothly, uses few technical terms, and employs a large amount of simple and easy-to-understand spoken language, making the reader feel as if the author is talking to you in a friendly way.

    The content of the article is also solid and substantial. More importantly, the author connects our current political life and the new situation of the overall Great Leap Forward with philosophy. This cannot but convince people that we are indeed living in a great era that "produces philosophy."

    I hope that scientists and scholars will write more articles like this, and I also hope that the People's Daily will publish more articles like this in the future. This will be of great benefit to improving writing style and popularizing scientific theories.　Jiangxi Boyang Middle School　Shen Fangchu

    哲学并不神秘
    4月18日第七版上刊载的潘梓年同志写的“大家来学点儿哲学”是一篇好文章。讲哲学的文章很容易写成干巴巴的，而潘梓年同志的文章一气呵成，很少用术语，大量地运用了浅显易懂的口语，使人读了好像是作者在对你亲切地谈话。
    文章的内容也很扎实，很有份量。更重要的是作者把我国当前的政治生活和全面大跃进的新形势，与哲学联系起来了。这就不能不令人深信：我们现在确实是生活在一个“出哲学”的伟大的时代里。
    希望科学家们、学者们多写些这样的文章，也希望人民日报今后多登些这样的文章。这对改进文风，科学理论通俗化都有莫大的好处。　江西波阳中学　沈昉初
