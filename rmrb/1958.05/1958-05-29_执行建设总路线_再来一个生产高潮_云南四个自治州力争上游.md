Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 28th: The Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, and Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province are organizing a new upsurge in industrial and agricultural production to further implement the Party's general line for socialist construction.

The Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, in order to double grain production—aiming for 800 jin per mu—completed the water conservancy project that can irrigate 310,000 mu of land during the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. Now, they have proposed to build hundreds more water conservancy projects to turn more than 100,000 mu of "thunderous" fields into saturated paddy fields. More than 70,000 people of various ethnic groups are working day and night on the construction sites. The Dai people, who are currently picking Pu'er tea, are determined to double the annual tea production. They have already picked more than 16,000 dan. In mid-May, they worked hard for seven days and nights to set up seven tea processing factories, and they plan to set up another sixty-three before the end of the month.

The four counties, including Yuanyang, where the Hani people live, had no industry at all in the past. This year, they are vigorously developing factories and mines, and an upsurge was set off during the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party. More than 500 factories and mines have been put into production one after another. Now, they are stepping up the construction of iron-smelting blast furnaces and lead and copper smelting furnaces, organizing a new upsurge, and striving to make the total industrial output value catch up with the total agricultural output value this year.

In the Tibetan-populated areas of the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, there were no paddy fields or irrigated land in the past. When encountering drought, they used to chant scriptures to pray for rain. In the past two days, they have broken superstition, tried planting five mu of rice, and built water conservancy projects to irrigate more than 50,000 mu of dry land. They are still continuing to irrigate.

    执行建设总路线　再来一个生产高潮
    云南四个自治州力争上游
    新华社昆明28日电　云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州、德宏傣族景颇族自治州、西双版纳傣族自治州和迪庆藏族自治州，组织新的工农业生产高潮来进一步执行党的社会主义建设的总路线。
    西双版纳傣族自治州为了使粮食产量翻一倍——达到亩产八百斤而兴修的可灌三十一万亩的水利工程，已在八大第二次会议期间赶修完毕。现在又提出再兴修数百项水利工程，把十多万亩“雷响”田改成饱水田，现在七万多各族人民，正夜以继日地在工地上苦战。正在采普洱茶的傣族人民决心使茶叶的年产量增加一倍，现在已采摘了一万六千多担。5月中旬他们苦战七昼夜，办起了七个茶叶初制厂，在月底前还要再办六十三个。
    哈尼族聚居的元阳等四县，过去根本没有工业，今年大办厂矿，在中共八届第二次会议期间掀起了高潮，有五百多个厂矿陆续投入生产，现在正加紧建立炼铁高炉和炼铅、铜的炉，组织新的高潮，力争工业总产值在今年赶上农业总产值。
    迪庆藏族自治州藏族聚居的地区，过去没有水田和水浇地，遇到干旱就念经求雨，这两天里，他们破除迷信，试种了五亩水稻，还兴修水利，浇灌了五万多亩旱地。现在还在继续灌溉。
