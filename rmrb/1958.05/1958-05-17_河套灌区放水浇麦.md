Hetao Irrigation District Releases Water to Irrigate Wheat

    (By this newspaper) The four main water diversion canals in the Hetao Irrigation District of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have recently begun to release water to irrigate wheat. Yellow water slowly flows into the canals from the newly built, wide water diversion inlets.

    This year, the spring wheat in the Hetao area is better than in any previous year, growing evenly and vigorously, with the wheat fields a lush green.
