    Tianjin has formed a scientific and technological contingent of over ten thousand scientific and technological workers from four directions to implement comprehensive collaboration, twisting scientific research and production into one rope. This creates favorable conditions for the technological revolution and for completing the task of the production leap forward with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
    This comprehensive collaboration was carried out under the unified leadership of the Party committee and the close integration of leading cadres and experts from production departments. The Secretary of the Secretariat of the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave instructions at the Tianjin Municipal Science Work Committee meeting held at the end of March, clearly outlining the direction of industrial development and scientific research in Tianjin. During the discussion process, thirteen professional groups and fifty-nine subgroups were established according to the industrial management system. These professional groups are led by responsible leading cadres from relevant production departments, inviting professors, engineers, and scientific researchers from relevant majors to participate. Each professional group is introduced to the industrial development plan by the relevant industrial departments, allowing scientists and professors to understand the situation and requirements of the production departments, and to discuss the production plan, propose suggestions and revisions. Then, according to the development needs of the industrial departments, a scientific research plan is formulated. Each professional group or subgroup also put forward key research projects related to improving gas generators, the automation and electrification of chemical machinery, comprehensive utilization of coal, synthetic fibers, antibiotics, etc., in accordance with Tianjin's development direction of producing advanced, large-scale, precision, and new products.
    In the process of organizing collaboration, scientific and technical personnel and production departments promoted the spirit of collectivism, laying a reliable ideological foundation for comprehensive collaboration. Many experts and professors criticized their personal fame and gain viewpoints. For example, some people were willing to be "soloists" and unwilling to cooperate with others; some simply pursued so-called academic value, preferring to drill into unpopular fields in order to make a splash, rather than study practical problems in production. After criticizing these erroneous ideas, many scientists and professors established a collective mutual assistance and support style, organizing the city's scientific strength. The research project of extracting potassium, magnesium, bromine, potassium-magnesium fertilizer, and other raw materials from the bittern remaining from seawater salt production, which had not been started due to the scattered research forces, has now concentrated the forces of the Salt Industry Science Research Institute of the Ministry of Light Industry, the Department of Chemical Engineering of Tianjin University, the Dagukou Factory of Yongli Soda Industry Company, and the Chemical Research Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry of Tianjin, and established a special research group on the comprehensive utilization of bittern, making large-scale research and experiments possible. After examining their departmentalism, industrial departments provided scientists with strong assistance in research funding, equipment, and the provision of assistants.
    After more than a month of discussion, new cooperative relationships have now been established in many units, and cooperative contracts between universities, scientific research institutions, and production departments are being signed successively. Scientific research institutions based on new cooperative relationships are also being established. Some scientists and professors have begun to go to factories and enterprises to assist enterprise technical personnel in scientific research. The close cooperation between scientific research departments and industrial departments has provided a guarantee for completing the great leap forward task with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

    天津组成科学技术大军
    本报讯　天津市四路科学大军一万多名科学技术工作者实行全面大协作，使科学研究和生产拧成一股绳，为技术革命以及多快好省地完成生产大跃进的任务创造了良好的条件。
    这次全面大协作，是在党委统一领导、生产部门领导干部和专家密切结合下进行的。中共天津市委员会书记处书记在3月底举行的天津市科学工作委员会会议上作了指示，明确提出天津市工业发展和科学研究的方向。在讨论过程中，按照工业主管系统，分别成立了十三个专业组和五十九个小组。在这些专业组里，都由有关生产部门的领导干部负责掌握，邀请有关专业的教授、工程师和科学研究人员参加。每一个专业组都由有关工业部门介绍工业发展规划，使科学家、教授们了解生产部门的情况和要求，并且对生产规划进行讨论，提出建议和修正意见，然后根据工业部门的发展需要制订科学研究计划。各专业组或小组还根据天津市发展高级、大型、精密、新产品的生产方向，提出了有关改进煤气机、化工机械的自动化和电气化、煤的综合利用、合成纤维、抗生素等重点研究项目。
    在组织协作过程中，科学技术人员和生产部门都发扬了集体主义的精神，为全面大协作打下了可靠的思想基础。很多专家、教授批判了自己的个人名利观点，例如有的人愿意当“单干户”，不愿和别人合作；有的单纯追求所谓学术价值，为了一鸣惊人，宁肯钻冷门，而不愿意研究生产中的实际问题。许多科学家、教授批判了这些错误思想以后，树立了集体互助、互相支援的风气，使全市科学力量组织起来。由于研究力量分散而没有着手进行的从海水制盐剩余的苦卤中取钾、镁、溴、钾镁肥料等原料的研究项目，这次集中了轻工业部制盐工业科学研究所、天津大学化工系、永利久大化学工业公司沽厂和天津化工部化工研究所等四方面力量，成立了苦卤综合利用专题研究小组，使进行大规模研究试验成为可能。工业部门检查了本位主义思想以后，在研究经费、设备和提供助手等方面尽量给科学家们大力协助。
    经过一个多月的讨论，现在许多单位新的协作关系已经建立，高等学校、科学研究机构和生产部门的协作合同正陆续签订。在新的协作关系基础上的科学研究机构也着手建立。一些科学家、教授开始到工厂企业单位，协助企业技术人员进行科学研究。由于科学研究部门和工业部门密切协作，为多快好省地完成大跃进任务提供了保证。（附图片）
