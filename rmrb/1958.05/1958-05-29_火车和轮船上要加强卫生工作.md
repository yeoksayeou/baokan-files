    Strengthen Hygiene Work on Trains and Ships
    I traveled from Hankou to Chengdu, successively taking the Yangtze River Shipping Administration's Jiangxia Wheel and Minquan Wheel ships, as well as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway's 51 express train. The cleaning and elimination of the "Four Pests" work on these trains and ships was very poorly done. On the train, I saw cockroaches, mosquitoes, and flies. On the Minquan Wheel, I found small flying insects and rat droppings in the food. It was even worse on the Jiangxia Wheel. In the fourth-class cabin, flies were everywhere. In our Room 13 alone, we killed a total of five cockroaches from the drawers and beds. Neither the trains nor the ships had even simple tools for eliminating the "Four Pests," such as fly swatters. I hope that these trains and ships can strengthen their cleaning and hygiene work.

    火车和轮船上要加强卫生工作
    我从汉口到成都，先后乘过长江航运管理局的江峡轮、民权轮，以及成渝铁路的51次快车，这些车上和船上的清洁和除四害的工作，都作得很差。在车上我就看到了蟑螂、蚊子和苍蝇。在民权轮上，饭里面吃出了小飞虫和老鼠粪，而在江峡轮上就更糟，四等舱里，苍蝇到处飞，仅我们住的13号房间里，就从抽斗里、床上一共打死了五个蟑螂。无论在车上和船上，竟连蝇拍等简单的除四害的工具都没有。希望这些车和船上，能加强清洁卫生工作。
