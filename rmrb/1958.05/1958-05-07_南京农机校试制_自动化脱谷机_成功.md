    Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization School Successfully Trial-Produces "Automated Threshing Machine"
    Since implementing the teaching policy of "diligence, work-study," all teachers, students, and staff of Nanjing Agricultural Mechanization School have been actively seeking ways to utilize the existing machinery and equipment in the practice factory to manufacture products. After the "Double-Anti" movement, their revolutionary enthusiasm grew even stronger. In just two weeks, they successfully trial-produced the "automated threshing machine," which is currently most needed in agriculture. It can thresh rice, wheat, millet, and soybeans, with a power output of 500 to 950 kilograms per hour, and can be driven by only a three- to four-horsepower engine. Its characteristics are: lightweight and flexible. The school plans to produce four to five thousand units this year and is studying how to modify it to be driven by animal power, to suit the current difficulties in rural areas where there are no engines.

    南京农机校试制“自动化脱谷机”成功
    南京农业机械化学校自贯彻“勤工俭学”的教学方针后，全校师生员工积极想办法，发挥现有实习工厂的机械设备，制造产品。通过
  “双反”运动后，革命的干劲更大，经过两周的时间，试制成功当前农业上最需要的“自动化脱谷机”。它可以脱粒稻、麦、小米、大豆，每小时功率可脱粒五百到九百五十公斤，只需三到四马力发动机即可带动。它的特点是：轻便、灵活。该校今年将生产四千到五千台，并研究改装成畜力原动机带动，适合当前农村没有发动机的困难。
