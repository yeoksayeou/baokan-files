A way to extract the rare element lithium salt from salt field brine has been found. This is a contribution made by students of the Chemical Thermodynamics Department of Sichuan University, led by their teacher Gu Zheng, during their internship at the Zigong Chemical Plant.

Lithium is a light metal element among rare elements. It has special uses in the national defense metallurgical industry, and it is also widely used in medicine, special ceramics, special batteries, alkaline electrolytes, and other fields. However, our country currently lacks the raw materials for extracting this element.

Two or three years ago, scientific research departments had already determined that the brine from the Zigong salt field contained this element, but a method for extraction had not yet been found. During their internship at the Zigong Chemical Plant, the students of the Chemical Thermodynamics Department of Sichuan University, in addition to working with the workers, often went deep into the site to find solutions for utilizing chemical elements. After six days of hard work, they discovered that the bromine production waste mother liquor of the plant contained lithium sulfate. Using sodium carbonate as a reagent for separation experiments, they finally succeeded, extracting approximately 25 kilograms of lithium salt from each cubic meter of bromine production waste mother liquor. If this waste mother liquor is fully utilized, at least 150 tons of various lithium salt products can be produced annually. This creates favorable conditions for the direct extraction of metallic lithium.

    找到了提制锂的途径
    本报讯　从盐场卤水中提制稀有锂盐元素已经找到途径。这是四川大学化学热力系的学生们最近在自贡化工厂实习时，在他们的教师古正带领下作出的一项贡献。
    锂是稀有元素中的一种轻金属元素。它在国防冶金工业上有特殊用途，在医药、特殊陶瓷、特殊蓄电池、碱性电解液等方面也有广泛用途。但是目前我国还缺少提制这种元素的原料。
    两三年以前科学研究部门已经确定自贡盐场的卤水中含有这种元素，可是一直还没找到提制方法。四川大学化学热力系的学生们到自贡化工厂进行实习的过程中，除了和工人同劳动以外，就经常深入现场找寻利用化工元素的方案。经过六天苦战，他们发现该厂制溴废母液中含有硫酸锂，用碳酸钠作试剂进行分离试验，终于获得成功，在制溴的每立方公尺废母液中约可提出锂盐二十五公斤。如果把这种废母液充分利用起来，每年至少可以生产一百五十吨以上的各种锂盐产品。这为直接提制金属锂创造了有利条件。
