Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th. These days, scientific workers in various universities and colleges in Guangzhou have stepped out of the school gates one after another to learn from farmers in the countryside, acknowledge "native experts" as teachers, and conduct scientific research in combination with the problems raised by the masses in production.

The citrus yellow shoot disease research group, headed by Huang Changxian, director of the Department of Horticulture of the South China Agricultural College, has gone to Xinhui County to conduct research on the prevention and treatment of yellow shoot disease, a major enemy of citrus production. The group includes professors from the Department of Plant Protection, Department of Horticulture, and Department of Soil Science of the Agricultural College, as well as scientific researchers from the South China Agricultural Science Institute and the Special Products Section of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture, a total of twelve people. They will extensively investigate disease-free parent trees in Xinhui, Boluo, and other counties, and use disease-free scions to meet the needs of the great development of citrus production for seedlings. On the other hand, they will conduct detailed investigations and research on the source of yellow shoot disease and summarize the experience of veteran farmers in disease prevention and treatment. They will also go to Puning County, the main citrus producing area in Guangdong, and prepare to live with Huang Meishen, an old farmer who has cultivated citrus for three generations without ever experiencing yellow shoot disease, to carefully observe, learn, and summarize Huang Meishen's cultivation experience, and strive to formulate methods in the shortest possible time to do a thorough job in the prevention and treatment of yellow shoot disease. Kang Xinyuan, director of the Department of Chemical Engineering of the South China Institute of Technology, and the biogas power generation research group, composed of fourteen scientific research workers from the Department of Chemical Engineering, Department of Civil Engineering, and Department of Mechanical Engineering, have set off for Panyu County to investigate and study the problems urgently to be solved by the masses in the development of biogas power generation—the structure of fermentation tanks, the formulation of raw materials for fermentation and fermentation conditions, how to ensure continuous power generation, and the selection and use of internal combustion engines; in addition, 56 different formulations and conditions of fertilizer fermentation experiments are being carried out in the college, and a new fermentation tank is being built for research. They plan to basically solve these problems by the end of this month. Yang Bangjie, chairman of the Guangzhou Sericulture Society and director of the Department of Sericulture of the South China Agricultural College, and Li Xiehua, vice chairman and director of the Department of Silkworm Leaves of the South China Agricultural Science Institute, led scientific researchers to Shunde County, a major silkworm and mulberry producing area, to investigate and study from all aspects the various factors that cause "rotten rearing" (high mortality rate) in silkworm breeding every spring and summer; to formulate scientific measures to eliminate the historical "rotten rearing" of silkworms. Entomologist Pu Zhelong, professor of the Department of Biology of Sun Yat-sen University, went to Xinhui County to specifically learn and summarize the successful experience of "native expert" Li Shimei in preventing and controlling termites. Sun Yat-sen Medical College has also formed a rural mobile medical team including professors of internal medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology to go to Jiangmen, Xinhui, Panyu and other counties and cities. On the one hand, they will participate in local medical work, provide technical guidance and assist in training health cadres; on the other hand, they will investigate and study endemic diseases that are most harmful to the masses, and carry out prevention and radical cure.

　　甘拜“土专家”为师
　　广东科学工作者下乡研究生产问题
    据新华社广州10日电　这几天，广州市各高等学校的科学工作者纷纷跨出校门，到农村去向农民学习，拜“土专家”为师，结合群众在生产中提出来的问题进行科学研究。
    以华南农学院园艺系主任黄昌贤教授为首的柑桔黄龙病研究小组，已经去新会县，对柑桔生产的大敌黄龙病进行防治的研究。这个小组包括有农学院植保系、园艺系、土壤系的教授和华南农业科学研究所、广东省农业厅特产处的科学研究人员共十二人。他们将在新会、博罗等县广泛调查无病母树，用无病接穗的办法满足柑桔生产大发展对苗木的需要；另一方面详细地调查研究黄龙病的病源和总结老农对病害防治的经验。他们还将到广东柑桔的主要产地普宁县去，准备和三代栽培柑桔从未发生过黄龙病害的老农黄美深生活在一起，认真地观察、学习和总结黄美深的栽培经验，力求在最短时间内订出办法，作好黄龙病的彻底防治工作。华南工学院化工系主任康辛元和化工系、土木系、机械系等共十四名科学研究工作者组成的沼气发电研究小组，已出发到番禺县，调查研究群众在发展沼气发电中急待解决的问题——发酵池的结构、发酵用原料配合及发酵的条件、如何保证连续发电、内燃机的选择和使用等问题；另外在学院里也进行着五十六种不同配料、条件的肥料发酵试验，并新建了一个发酵池进行研究。他们计划在本月底基本解决这些问题。广州蚕丝学会理事长、华南农学院蚕桑系主任杨邦杰和副理事长、华南农业科学研究所蚕叶系主任李燮华，率领着科学研究人员到盛产蚕桑的顺德县，从各方面调查研究每年春夏间造成育蚕“烂造”（死亡率高）的各种因素；为消灭历史性的育蚕“烂造”订出科学措施。昆虫学家、中山大学生物系教授蒲蛰龙，到新会县专门学习和总结“土专家”李始美对防治白蚂蚁的成功经验。中山医学院也组成了一个包括有内科、外科、眼科、儿科和妇产科教授的下乡巡回医疗队，到江门、新会、番禺等县市去，一方面参加当地医疗工作，作技术上的指导和协助培养卫生干部，另一方面调查研究对群众危害性最大的地方病，进行预防和根治。
