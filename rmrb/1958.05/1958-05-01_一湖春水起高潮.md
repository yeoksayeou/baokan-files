    "Open all the gates!" Technician Xiao Xie, after issuing the operating command, quickly stepped onto the platform, helping pipe fitter Lao Meng to loosen the inlet gate, which was taller than a person. Xiao Tie, a young female apprentice, had been fighting alongside Lao Meng for more than ten days and nights. Now she was listening intently to the sound of the water, suddenly pressing her face against the pipe wall, and calling out in a low voice to us: "The cooling lake water is rushing in!"

    The good news spread faster than electricity. Meter readers were beaming with smiles, and the steps of the on-duty electricians also quickened. This stream of cool torrent from the lake will increase the vacuum of our condensers by 4%, save the circulating water pumps 100,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per month, and give our steam turbine generators a surge of energy—generating the equivalent of 30,000 laborers worth of power!

    When the inspection team walked out of the factory building, they were greeted by a beautiful moonlit night. The quality of the outlet channel was all good. The circulating water rushed out from more than 10,000 copper tubes and entered the sealed outlet channel, like a powerful dragon that had been restrained; only when we passed the manholes could we hear its thunderous roar. The end point of our inspection was a castle-like outlet gate. The circulating water converged into the lake from a depth of more than ten feet, causing numerous eddies on the water surface, creating countless silver snakes shimmering in the moonlight. In the distance, the sound of ice breaking continuously was heard, indicating that our cooling lake had smoothly started working.

    However, no one can forget the arduous experience of this cooling lake. In June of last year, the lake had already been filled with water. This is the first surface reservoir in the country. But autumn passed, and the lake had not yet been put into operation. People were anxious. Particularly worrying was that in the face of successive difficulties, the relationship between Party A and Party B became increasingly uncoordinated. "Why don't you create conditions for us?" This was the question from the installation team. "Why don't you consider the city's electricity needs?" This was our reply. In this cacophony of accusations, everyone became accustomed to presenting difficulties, vying for concessions, and shifting responsibilities to each other; rework, idle work, and delays became commonplace. In the dead of winter, the entire lake surface froze, and layers of ice ridges climbed up the embankment, engulfing the hearts of the builders from both parties.

    It wasn't until a month ago that the bugle call of the Great Leap Forward, like the spring thunder of the Awakening of Insects, revitalized us from this predicament.

    "We must get the lake water into the factory in the first quarter!" We put forward our slogan. Another meeting between Party A and Party B was convened. It was still the same people, but the mood, language, and expressions had all changed for the better. Everything was changing. Now we also presented, presenting our strength and drive; we also argued, arguing about suggestions and measures. Everyone argued heatedly. Lao Meng, however, listened quietly on the sidelines. Finally, he stood up and stuttered, "It's easy to draw a few lines on the blueprint!" Everyone understood the meaning of this sentence, so the meeting was moved down from the third floor. We inspected every key process on the spot, climbing up and down the pipelines, debating and gesticulating, and jointly making deployments. The workers on the construction site enthusiastically joined our ranks. At the time, we didn't know this was called an on-site meeting, we only felt that everyone was working together in unison and things became easier to handle. The old formula of buck-passing was burned by the masses and replaced by a new type of collaborative formula of "presenting, arguing, and taking on." At this time, Lao Meng was the most excited. At the site, whenever he heard someone mention Party A and Party B, he would sternly remind them: "Catching up with Britain in fifteen years, we're all in the same boat!"

    The wave of the Great Leap Forward pushed up the tide of collaboration.

    Before switching the water source, we had to insert a sloping gate, more than three meters high, into a water well of just over one square meter, to divert the new and old water sources. The installation team fought for seven days and nights, testing various types of gates: single-layer, double-layer, mud-filled sandwich—none of them could completely eliminate leakage. As soon as this difficulty was reported, two divers from the Fengman Hydropower Plant rushed over from thousands of miles away that evening. As soon as they arrived, without waiting to rest, they put on their helmets and lead flippers, and wriggled their bodies into the water. The success or failure of the entire project depended on those few pieces of water-blocking cotton wool in the water! We stood by the well, so nervous that we seemed to sink to the bottom with them, also breathing compressed air. Only when they both took turns fighting hard for more than twenty hours and the good news came from the bottom of the water did everyone breathe a sigh of relief. When we thought that the lights of thousands of homes in Taiyuan and Yangquan were finally guaranteed, how could we not extend our hands in gratitude to them?

    Before the Spring Festival, when we were preparing to switch the water source of one generating unit, we suddenly discovered that the outlet water level was too high. It was necessary to chisel down the siphon partition wall, which would require extending the construction period by one month. Faced with this unexpected setback, we still relied on on-site meetings. Engineer Xie Shukang proposed that if the three generating units were switched over at the same time, rework could be avoided. This suggestion, like lightning, tore through our past conservative night. Technical personnel stood up and guaranteed to take all measures. The workers raised their fists: "All work affecting the load will be completed during the Spring Festival holiday!" It was truly a leap forward on top of a leap forward! Difficulties also became the driving force for a big step forward. Captain Quan of the installation team, without waiting for the meeting to end, led the workers to start working on the second generating unit. That evening, the installation workers from the second heat and power station, sixty miles away, came to support us with songs and cheers. In this way, we began this extraordinary battle for fifteen days.

    Fifteen days passed. The vast cooling lake began to work.

    "It's time to go home and rest." Lao Meng, who had fought hard for fifteen days and nights, stood up. Turning his head, the lights in the power plant were as bright as day.

    一湖春水起高潮
    太原热电厂总工程师　高昌瑞
    “截门全开！”技术员小谢，发布完操作命令，就迅速踏上平台，帮着管工老孟，松开那比人还高的进水闸门。小铁是个青年女徒工，已经跟着老孟苦战了十多个昼夜了。现在她正侧着耳朵测听水声，突然把脸庞全部贴上了管壁，压紧嗓子招呼我们：“冷却湖的水冲进来了。”
    好消息传播得比电还快。抄表工人挂满了笑容，值班电工的脚步，也加上了劲。湖上来的这一股清凉的激流，将使我们的凝汽器，提高4％的真空，使循环水泵每月节约十万度电，使我们的汽轮发电机猛然增一身干劲——多发出抵得上三万个劳动力的电能！
    当检查沟道的队伍走出厂房时，迎头是一天好月色。出水沟道的质量，全部良好。循环水从一万多根铜管中冲出来，进入密闭的出水沟中，像一条被束缚着的强龙；只有当我们走过人孔井时，才能听到它万马奔腾的吼声。我们检查的终点是一座城堡型出水闸门。循环水从十多尺的深处汇入湖中，使水面转动出不少漩涡，在月光下引起无数条银蛇的闪耀。远处，不断传来春冰的拆裂声，说明我们的冷却湖已顺利地开始工作。
    但是，谁也忘不了这个冷却湖的艰辛经历。去年6月，湖里已经放水。这是祖国的第一个地面上的水库。但是秋天过去了，这湖还没有投入工作。人们着急了。特别令人焦心的是：在接踵而来的困难面前，甲乙方关系却越来越不协调。“你为什么不为我们创造条件？”这是安装队的质问。“你为什么不考虑全市用电？”这是我们的答复。在这种你呀我呀的刺耳声中，大家习惯于摆困难，争退步和互相推诿；返工，窝工，延期便成了家常便饭。隆冬，整个湖面封冻了，一层层冰棱爬上堤来，吞噬住甲乙双方建设者的心。
    直到一个月前，跃进的号角，才像惊蛰的春雷一样，使我们从这种困境中重新振奋起来。
    “一定要让湖水在第一季进厂！”我们提出了自己的口号。又一次甲乙方的会议召开了。人还是我们这几个，但心情、语言和面色都换了一个季。一切全在变。现在我们也摆，摆的是力量和干劲；我们也争，争的是建议和措施。大家争得面红耳赤。老孟却在旁边静静地听着。最后站了起来，结结巴巴地说：“在蓝图上划几条线，倒是容易！”大家懂得这句话的意义，于是会议便从三楼上搬了下来。我们实地检查了每一个关键工序，沿着管道爬上落低，边辩论，边比划，共同作出部署。工地上的工人，热烈地加入我们的行列。当时，还不知道这就叫现场会议，只觉得上下左右扭成一股劲，事儿就好办。工作任务肯定了，大家揽着干，抢着干。过去的扯皮公式被群众烧光了，代之以新型的“摆、争、揽”的协作公式。这时，要数老孟头最兴奋了。在现场一听到还有人提甲乙方，便?喝着提醒：“十五年赶上英国，咱们都在一条航船上！”
    跃进的浪潮推起了协作的波涛。
    在切换水源前，我们要在一米多平方的水井中，插入三人多高的一块斜闸板门，让新旧水源分流。安装队奋战了七个昼夜，试验了各种型式的闸门：单层的、双层的、夹心注泥的——都不能完全消灭泄漏。这个困难刚刚反映上去，当晚，丰满水电厂的两个潜水工人，便从几千里外赶了来。一到，等不及休息，便戴上头盔和铅蹼，蠖曲着身子潜进水去。要知整个工程的成败，就决定于他们水中几块堵水的棉絮呀！我们站在井旁紧张得好像跟着他们沉下水底，也呼吸着压缩空气似的。直等到他们两人轮流苦战了二十多小时，从水底传上捷报时，大家才松了一口气。当我们想到太原阳泉千门万户不夜的灯火终于有了保证时，怎能不向他们伸出感谢的手呢？
    春节前，当我们准备切换好一个机组的水源后，忽然发现出水水位过高。必须凿低虹吸隔墙，这需要延长一个月的工期。对着这意想不到的打击，我们还是依靠现场会议。工程师谢树康提出了如果三个机组同时切换，就可以避免返工。这建议像闪电似的，划破了我们过去保守的夜幕。技术人员站起来，保证做好一切措施。工人们举起了拳头：“一切影响负荷的工作，春节假期中包干完！”真是跃进再跃进呀！困难也变成了大踏步促进的动力。安装队权队长没等散会，便领着工人在第二个机组上动起手来。当晚，六十里外热电二站的安装工人，歌声欢腾地赶来支援。就这样我们开始了这十五天来不平常的战斗。
    十五天过去了。庞大的冷却湖开始工作了。
    “该回家歇一歇了。”苦战十五昼夜的老孟站了起来。转过头来，电厂里的灯火辉煌如昼。
