Husband and Wife Arguing
Wang Luogui

The locust trees emit fragrance, the crescent moon is crooked,
On the street, there's a noisy commotion as people carry a pole.
Who's not sleeping in the middle of the night?
Oh, it turns out to be a young couple returning from a meeting.
Their home is just outside Xizhimen,
Turn south when you see the alley after leaving the house.
Walking on the left is Yuzhi,
Walking on the right is Zhicai.
They were just returning from the voters' meeting,
Walking along, their opinions clashed and an argument started.
Zhicai said, "If we're voting, let's vote for Comrade Wang."
Yuzhi said, "If we're voting, let's vote for Uncle Liu."
"Comrade Wang is an enthusiastic and good comrade."
"Uncle Liu is also a loyal and devoted good person."
"When electing representatives, we must first consider politics."
"'Politics first,' you don't need to tell me, I understand."
"Comrade Wang is a veteran party member."
"Uncle Liu still has a bullet in his leg!"
"Comrade Wang works hard and without complaint for everyone."
"If we're talking about working hard and without complaint, that belongs to Uncle Liu."
"Who do you think wanted to catch sparrows during the Four Pests campaign?"
"Who do you think helped us carry the flour back last time?"
"Comrade Wang never smiles unless he knows you well."
"Uncle Liu's words are like blooming flowers when he speaks to people."
"Humph, if we're voting, let's vote for Comrade Wang!"
"Um, if we're voting, we must vote for Uncle Liu!"
"You can vote for whoever you want!"
"You don't need to force or dictate how I vote!"
"Don't put labels on me all the time!"
"That's because you're willing to wear them yourself!"
"Hey! Why are the streetlights so bright?"
"Wow! Look at you, how did you lead me here?"
(Spoken) Whoa! We've arrived at the Soviet Exhibition Center!

　　夫妻顶嘴
　　王洛贵
　　槐树飘香月牙儿歪，
　　马路上嘁嘁喳喳有人把杠抬。
　　是谁半夜三更不睡觉哇？
　　噢，原来是小两口开会刚回来。
　　他们家就住西直门外，
　　出门见胡同往南拐。
　　左边走的是玉芝，
　　右边走的是志才。
　　他们刚开完选民大会往回走，
　　走着走着意见不和抬起来。
　　志才说：“要选就选王同志。”
　　玉芝说：“要选就选刘大伯。”
　　“王同志是个热心的好同志。”
　　“刘大伯也是个赤胆忠心的好人材。”
    “选代表可先得看政治。”
    “‘政治第一’这事不用你说我明白。”
    “王同志人家是老党员。”
　　“刘大伯腿上的子弹还没取出来呢！”
　　“王同志为大家工作任劳又任怨。”
　　“要讲任劳任怨可属人家刘大伯。”
　　“你说除四害上要逮麻雀的那是谁？
　　“你说上回买面谁帮咱抬回来？”
　　“王同志可见人不笑不说话。”
　　“刘大伯见人说话像朵花儿开。”
　　“哼，要选就选王同志！”
　　“嗯，要选一定要选刘大伯！”
　　“你愿选谁就选谁！”
　　“选举这事不用你强迫命令乱安排！”
　　“你别动不动地扣帽子！”
　　“那是你自己愿往头上戴！”
　　“哪！怎么路灯这么亮？”
　　“哟！你看你，咋把我领到这里来？”
　　（白）嚯；到了苏联展览馆啦！
