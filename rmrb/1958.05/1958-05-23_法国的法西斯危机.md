    The Fascist Crisis in France

    France is facing an extremely perilous situation. Fascist forces have launched a rampant offensive. In Algeria, the generals of the colonial army and the local French ultra-colonialists have seized power through a military coup. In France, fascist thugs are constantly carrying out provocative activities, and politicians from far-right parties are trying their best to create disturbances. This is a carefully planned conspiracy with a unified arrangement: to attack from both Algeria and mainland France to create conditions for de Gaulle to establish a military dictatorship. De Gaulle, the fascist ringleader who has been pulling the strings behind the scenes for several years, has now come out into the open and clamors for “extraordinary procedures” to seize “extraordinary powers.”

    The republican system is under serious threat. Defending the republic has become the most urgent combat task of the French people. The French Communist Party has issued a resounding call, urging all workers and people to unite, repel the fascist offensive, and block de Gaulle’s path to military dictatorship. Throughout France, the working class and progressive forces have already begun to take action.

    A sharp struggle is underway. The outcome of this struggle will determine the future of the French nation and the future of every French person.

    What does fascism mean? The French people, who have suffered under Hitler's rule, have a deep understanding of this. In order to liberate themselves from Hitler's rule, the French people waged a heroic struggle and paid a heavy price in blood. But why have fascists in France been able to carry out activities since the war, and why are they so arrogant now?

    This is the evil consequence of the disastrous policies pursued by successive bourgeois governments in France.

    Since the French Communist Party was squeezed out of the government in May 1947, the French ruling clique has been following the United States in implementing a policy of arms expansion and war preparation, and has been engaged in colonial wars year after year. This has damaged France's national independence, its international status has declined, its domestic political situation has been turbulent for a long time, governments have changed frequently, its financial difficulties have continued to deepen, and people's lives have deteriorated sharply. … As a result, the fascist groups have taken advantage of the turbulent domestic situation and the people's dissatisfaction with the status quo to develop their own strength among some backward masses.

    At the same time, because the so-called middle parties adhere to an anti-communist attitude, the governments they form have to rely on the support of the right wing and even the far right in parliament, which actually strengthens the influence and role of the fascist forces in French political life. Moreover, in order to promote unpopular policies, the bourgeois government has used various methods to suppress democratic forces domestically, and even attempted to deprive the people of their democratic rights by amending the constitution, thus creating a terrifying fascist atmosphere in the country. In addition, the secret arrests, torture, and concentration camp massacres of colonial people have also fueled fascist tendencies in the army.

    All of this constitutes a breeding ground for the propagation and growth of fascist germs in France.

    At present, the colonial war in Algeria has plunged France into an abyss of despair. On the one hand, the strength of the Algerian National Liberation Army is growing, and the unity of the North African people in the anti-colonial struggle is further strengthened, while the United States is taking the opportunity to undermine France. On the other hand, France is on the verge of financial bankruptcy, and raising huge military expenses for the Algerian war has become a serious problem. Therefore, the French people's call for a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue is growing louder and louder, and even more sober people in the bourgeoisie agree with the proposal for a ceasefire. The ruling clique is divided on how to save the collapse of the "French colonial empire," and there are fierce disputes between the various parties. The unprecedented chaos in the French political situation before and after the fall of the Gaillard cabinet reflects this situation. Therefore, the long-awaited fascist forces believe that their time has come, and on the one hand, they are using the banner of "national rejuvenation" to deceive the masses, and on the other hand, they are using riotous means to coerce the so-called middle parties of the bourgeoisie, attempting to seize the fate of France into their own hands.

    The rise of fascist forces is a trend in the French political situation, a dangerous trend. Another trend in the French political situation is that the working class and progressive forces are also developing rapidly. As far back as before the war, on February 6, 1934, de Gaulle’s predecessor, La Rocque, had staged a fascist riot, but it suffered a shameful defeat under the counterattack of the working class and democratic forces. After the anti-fascist World War II, the strength of the French people is stronger than ever before. The French Communist Party has always been the largest party in the French parliament after the war, and it enjoys great prestige and influence both inside and outside the parliament. The development of anti-fascist people's forces led to the collapse of de Gaulle's "Rally of the French People" in 1953, and de Gaulle had to pretend to issue a statement of "withdrawing from political activities" as a step to step down. The results of the general election in early 1956 showed that the strength of the French Communist Party had increased again. Regardless of the obstruction of the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, the French working class has increasingly strengthened its unity and combat strength. This shows that in the French political situation, there is a powerful people's force that can stop fascism.

    Nevertheless, the danger of the fascist threat must not be underestimated. This is because the bourgeois parties have consistently adopted an attitude of conniving with fascism since the war, the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party stubbornly insist on opposing the Communist Party and obstructing the unity of the working class, and the so-called middle parties are even more stubbornly insisting on打击 [dǎ jī - to strike] progressive forces and compromising with fascist forces. The history of the past eleven years has proved how profound the disasters their sinful attitude has brought to France. When the fascist forces are already so rampant today, they are still unwilling to repent and change this attitude of fueling the flames of fascism.

    The current vacillation and weakness of the Pflimlin government in the face of the fascist offensive stems from this. This government is mainly based on the so-called middle parties; after taking office, it brought in the Socialist Party to expand the middle majority and strengthen its position. When asking for authorization, Pflimlin once said that he would never succumb to the military rebellion against the republic, and therefore was passed by the parliament without the Communist Party expressing opposition. However, the measures taken by this government after taking office are not entirely in line with the promise at the time. This government allowed de Gaulle, the fascist ringleader, to hold a press conference to openly incite rebellion, but prohibited the French Communist Party and other progressive organizations from holding anti-fascist demonstrations. This government used the excuse of "insufficient information" to refuse to condemn the crimes of the rebels, but groundlessly clamored that "there is also a threat to our freedom on the extreme left wing"... As for the situation of the Socialist Party, it is the same. Although the leading bodies of the Socialist Party have declared their opposition to the fascist conspiracy and called on the democratic forces to take concerted action; at the same time, they continue to adopt a policy of splitting the anti-fascist unity of the working class, and openly require party members not to cooperate with the communists.

    It should also be pointed out that Pflimlin has no intention of changing the colonial suppression policy in Algeria until now. When the rebel generals clamored to resolutely implement the military suppression policy and ensure France's colonial status in Algeria, he repeatedly stated that he would never agree to give up Algeria either, as if this could help him win over the people from the fascist groups. However, the situation is just the opposite. The facts of more than three years have made it clear to the French people that the colonial war is harmful and unprofitable to them; only by recognizing the Algerian people's right to independence and establishing new relations between the two countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit can it truly conform to the national interests of France. The fascists are waving the banner of "national rejuvenation," but in reality, they want to drag France into a huge disaster. Because they are prepared to pursue a more crazy adventurous policy in North Africa, which can only cause more resolute resistance from the North African people, the war will be further expanded and prolonged, making France's situation more and more difficult, and forever losing the possibility of improving relations with the North African people. At the same time, the fascist forces are taking advantage of the chaos brought about by the war to incite blind nationalist sentiments, preparing conditions for the fascists to come to power. It is very dangerous for Pflimlin to try to stabilize the position of the French government by compromising with the fascist's colonial war policy and fascistization policy. Because the result of implementing this policy can only open the way for the United States to further control France and for the fascist forces to usurp power. And this is exactly what the vast majority of the French people resolutely oppose.

    In short, the facts are very clear: excluding the Communist Party and not relying on the strength of the people, it is impossible to effectively defend the republican system; not abandoning the colonial policy and refusing to seek a peaceful solution to the Algerian issue, it is also impossible to maintain France's independent status. The current actions of the Pflimlin government and the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party are exactly what the fascist forces are happy about. It is no wonder why de Gaulle specially expressed "respect" for Mollet, the right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, at the recent press conference, and called Lacoste, a Socialist who bears important responsibility for expanding the Algerian war, a "friend."

    At present, the fascist forces are very rampant, and the bourgeois government is implementing a right-leaning policy that essentially clears the way for the fascists to take the stage. It is precisely this policy of the French government and the bourgeois parties to compromise and yield to the fascist forces that has put the French republican system in an extremely dangerous situation. But no matter what, fascism certainly has no future. Although Hitler, the dictator, ran rampant for more than ten years, he finally ended up in a shameful end. Now de Gaulle wants to emulate Hitler of that year, and he will suffer an even more tragic end. Because, since then, the world has undergone earth-shaking changes. The current era is an era in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, an era in which the power of the people prevails over the power of reaction. It is the French people—the French people with strong strength and democratic traditions—who can ultimately determine the fate of France.

    The French people created the French Fourth Republic, and they will never tolerate de Gaulle's followers to overthrow this republic. They will also not allow the bourgeois parties to hand over the republic's power to the fascist forces. In this sharp struggle, the confrontation between the two forces is extremely clear. If the French bourgeois parties, including the right-wing leaders of the Socialist Party, do not quickly change their attitude and firmly stand on the side of the anti-fascist forces, they will inevitably be spurned by the French people.

### 法国的法西斯危机

    法国的法西斯危机
    法国面临着极端险恶的局面。法西斯势力发动了猖狂的进攻。在阿尔及利亚，殖民军队的将领和当地的法国极端殖民主义分子已经通过军事政变而攫取了政权。在法国国内，法西斯暴徒不断进行挑衅活动，极右翼党派的政客们在竭力制造骚乱。这是一个经过长期策划和有着统一布置的阴谋：从阿尔及利亚和法国本土两面夹攻，来为戴高乐上台建立军事独裁统治制造条件。几年来一直隐藏在幕后牵线的法西斯头子戴高乐，目前也已经公然出头，狂叫要通过“非常程序”来掌握“非常权力”。
    共和制度受到了严重的威胁。保卫共和国，已经成为法国人民最迫切的战斗任务。法国共产党发出了响亮的号召，呼吁全体劳动者和人民团结起来，击退法西斯的进攻，堵塞戴高乐的军事独裁道路。在法国各地，工人阶级和进步力量也已经开始了行动。
    一场尖锐的斗争正在开展着。这场斗争的结果，将关系到法兰西民族的前途，关系到每一个法国人的未来。
    法西斯意味着什么？对于这一点，受过希特勒统治的法国人民是有着深切体会的。为了从希特勒的统治下得到解放，法国人民曾经进行了英勇的斗争，并且付出了大量的鲜血。但是，为什么战后以来法西斯分子在法国一直能够进行活动，而且在目前气焰竟然这样嚣张呢？
    这是法国历届资产阶级政府执行灾难性政策所造成的恶果。
    自从1947年5月法国共产党被排挤出政府以后，法国统治集团一直追随美国执行扩军备战政策，并且连年不绝地进行着殖民战争。这使法国民族独立受到损害，国际地位日益下降；国内政局长期动荡，政府更迭频繁；财政困难不断加深，人民生活激剧恶化。……于是，法西斯集团就利用国内动乱的形势，利用人民不满于现状的情绪，在部分落后群众中发展自己的力量。
    同时，由于所谓中间党派坚持反共的态度，它们组成的政府在议会中不得不依靠右派甚至极右派的支持，这实际上加强了法西斯势力在法国政治生活中的影响和作用。不但如此，资产阶级政府为了推行不得人心的政策，在国内用种种方法镇压民主力量，甚至企图通过修改宪法来剥夺人民的民主权利，因而使国内弥漫着恐怖的法西斯气氛。此外，对殖民地人民进行秘密逮捕、酷刑拷打和集中营虐杀，这种做法也助长了军队中的法西斯倾向。
    所有这一切，构成了法西斯细菌在法国繁殖和生长的温床。
    目前，阿尔及利亚的殖民战争已经使法国陷入绝望的深渊。一方面，阿尔及利亚民族解放军的力量日益壮大，北非人民在反殖民主义斗争中的团结进一步加强，而美国却又乘机挖法国墙脚。另一方面，财政濒于破产，要为阿尔及利亚战争筹措庞大的军事费用已经成为严重的难题。因此，法国人民要求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题的呼声越来越高，甚至资产阶级中比较清醒的人士也赞成停战的主张。统治集团内部在怎样挽救“法兰西殖民帝国”的崩溃这个问题上意见分歧，各个党派之间争吵激烈。盖伊阿内阁倒台前后法国政局的空前混乱，就反映了这种形势。于是，等待已久的法西斯势力认为他们的时机已经来到了，就一面打起“民族复兴”的旗帜来欺骗群众，一面施用暴乱手段来要挟资产阶级的所谓中间党派，企图把法国的命运抓到自己手里。
    法西斯势力的抬头，这是法国政局中的一种趋势，危险的趋势。法国政局中的另一种趋势是，工人阶级和进步力量也在迅速发展。远在战前，1934年2月6日戴高乐的前辈拉罗克就曾经搞过法西斯暴动，然而在工人阶级和民主力量的反击下，遭到了可耻的失败。经过反法西斯的第二次世界大战以后，法国人民的力量比过去更强大了。法国共产党在战后的法国议会中一直居于第一大党的地位，它在议会内外都拥有极大的威望和影响。反法西斯的人民力量的发展，使得戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”在1953年宣告瓦解，戴高乐也不得不装腔作势地发表“退出政治活动”的声明来作为下台的台阶。1956年初的大选结果，法国共产党的力量又有了新的增长。法国工人阶级不顾社会党右翼领导的阻挠，日益加强了自己的团结和斗争力量。这表明，在法国的政治局势中，有着可以制止法西斯的强大的人民力量。
    尽管如此，绝不能低估法西斯威胁的危险性。这是因为，资产阶级政党在战后以来一贯地采取了纵容法西斯的态度，社会党右翼领袖顽固地坚持反对共产党和阻挠工人阶级的团结，所谓中间党派更是顽固地坚持打击进步力量而和法西斯势力妥协。十一年来的历史证明，他们这种罪恶态度给法国带来了多么深重的祸害。当法西斯势力已经如此猖狂的今天，他们还不肯憣然悔悟，改变这种助长法西斯凶焰的态度。
    弗林姆兰政府目前在法西斯进攻面前所表现的动摇和软弱，根源就在于此。这个政府是以所谓中间党派为主要基础组成的；上台以后又把社会党拉了进来，以扩大中间多数，加强自己的地位。在要求授权时，弗林姆兰曾经表示决不向反对共和国的军事叛乱屈服，因而才在共产党不表示反对的情况下得到议会通过。但是，这个政府上台以后所采取的措施，是和当时的诺言并不完全符合。这个政府允许戴高乐这个法西斯头子召开记者招待会来公开煽动叛乱，却禁止法国共产党和其它进步组织举行反法西斯示威。这个政府用“情况不够”作借口不肯斥责叛乱分子的罪行，却无中生有地叫嚷“在极左翼也存在着对我们自由的威胁”……。至于社会党的情况也是一样。社会党的领导机构虽然声明反对法西斯阴谋，并且呼吁民主力量采取一致行动；然而同时却继续采取着分裂工人阶级反法西斯团结的政策，公然要求党员群众不和共产党人进行合作。
    还应该指出的是，弗林姆兰直到现在还无意改变在阿尔及利亚的殖民镇压政策。当叛乱将领们狂叫坚决执行军事镇压政策，确保法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民地位时，他就再三声明他也决不同意放弃阿尔及利亚，似乎这可以有助于他同法西斯集团争取人心。然而，情况恰恰相反。三年多的事实已经使法国人民看得很清楚，殖民战争对他们说来是有百害而无一利的；只有承认阿尔及利亚人民的独立权利，并且在平等互利的基础上建立两国之间新的关系，才真正符合法国的民族利益。法西斯分子打着“民族复兴”的旗帜，实际上是要把法国拖进一场巨大的灾难中。因为，他们准备在北非推行更加疯狂的冒险政策，这只能引起北非人民更加坚决的反抗，战争将更加扩大与延长，使法国处境越来越困难，并且永远失去和北非人民改善关系的可能。与此同时，法西斯势力利用战争带来的混乱局面，煽动盲目的民族主义情绪，为法西斯上台准备条件。弗林姆兰想同法西斯分子的殖民战争政策和法西斯化政策妥协来稳定法国政府的地位是十分危险的。因为执行这种政策的结果只能为美国进一步控制法国，为法西斯势力篡夺政权开辟道路。而这正是法国广大人民所坚决反对的。
    总之，事实十分明显，排斥共产党，不依靠人民的力量，就决不能有力地保卫共和制度；不放弃殖民政策，拒绝寻求和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，也决不能保持法国的独立地位。目前弗林姆兰政府和社会党右翼领袖的这种做法，正是法西斯势力感到高兴的。这就无怪乎为什么戴高乐在最近的记者招待会上要特别对社会党右翼领袖摩勒表示“尊敬”，并且把对扩大阿尔及利亚战争负有重要责任的社会党人拉戈斯特叫做“朋友”了。
    目前，法西斯势力十分嚣张，而资产阶级政府又执行着实质上为法西斯的登台清扫道路的右倾政策。正是法国政府和资产阶级政党的这种向法西斯势力妥协退让的政策，使法国的共和制度处于极端危险的境地。但是，不管怎样，法西斯肯定是没有前途的。希特勒这个独裁者虽然横行十来年，最后终于落个可耻的下场，现在戴高乐想效法当年的希特勒，他就会遭到更悲惨的结局。因为，从那时以来，世界已经经过了翻天覆地的变化。目前的时代，是东风压倒西风的时代，是人民力量压倒反动力量的时代。能够决定法国命运的，毕竟是法国人民——有着强大力量和民主传统的法国人民。
    法国人民缔造了法兰西第四共和国，他们决不能容忍戴高乐的党徒来推翻这个共和国。他们也不会容许资产阶级政党拱手把共和国政权让给法西斯势力。在这场尖锐的斗争中，两种力量的对垒是极其分明的。法国的资产阶级政党，包括社会党的右翼领袖们，如果不迅速改变态度，坚决站到反法西斯力量这一边，他们就必然会被法国人民所唾弃。
