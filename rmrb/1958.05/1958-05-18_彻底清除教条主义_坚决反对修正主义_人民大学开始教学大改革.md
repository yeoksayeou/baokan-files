Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Renmin University of China's rectification movement has entered the stage of implementing the general line of socialist construction and carrying out major teaching reforms. Vice President Zou Lufeng made a mobilization report on this issue at a school-wide gathering of teachers and students on the 16th.

This major reform is being carried out on the basis of an ideological revolution centered on opposing individualism. As early as March, the school began preparing for the major reform. At the beginning of May, the school's CCP committee and the general party branches of each department first grasped the crucial link of liberating thought. They did this through teacher symposiums and heart-to-heart meetings to dispel concerns and expose ideas. At the same time, teachers were organized to go deep into reality and understand the actual situation in various professional departments. The seven departments of finance and economics have established cooperative relationships with various bureaus of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee. Teachers participated in relevant meetings and investigations of the professional departments, which provided materials and information for teaching. Leaders of the professional departments lectured and gave special reports at the school. Teachers from the Political Economics Teaching and Research Office and the Trade Economics Teaching and Research Office took students to the Tianqiao Market for visits after lecturing on the nature of socialist commerce, and then organized students to discuss. The Trial Law Teaching and Research Office used the "mock court" practice assignment method, with students acting as "chief judge," "jurors," "defendants," "plaintiffs," and "lawyers" to "try" some cases. These activities greatly liberated the thinking of teachers and enhanced their confidence in the major reform of teaching content. Zou Lufeng pointed out at the meeting on the 16th that the purpose of this major reform is: to resolutely implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism; to further implement the principles of combining theory with practice, education with production, intellectuals with workers and peasants, and intellectual labor with manual labor; to thoroughly eliminate dogmatism in teaching; to resolutely oppose revisionism; to make the school's work make an all-round great leap forward; to cultivate more and better political theory teachers and construction talents for the country, and to meet the needs of the new situation of the national production great leap forward and technological revolution. The central links of the reform are teaching and scientific research.

Zou Lufeng said: This reform must be carried out with a thorough revolutionary spirit, breaking down the old and establishing the new, rather than adopting a reformist approach. It is necessary to further closely integrate with relevant national professional departments and thoroughly reform teaching content according to the actual needs of national socialist construction, without conservatively maintaining outdated curriculum systems that lag far behind reality.

How to effectively reform teaching? Zou Lufeng proposed in his report that, in addition to continuing to mobilize the masses to speak out freely, it was decided to make full use of various forces inside and outside the school to expose problems, and then launch a grand debate in the spirit of combining theoretical discussion with practical work to unify ideological understanding. New teaching plans, teaching content reform plans, scientific research plans, and personal red-and-expert plans will be proposed. On this basis, the whole school will propose a comprehensive program of principles.

All teachers will launch a grand debate on teaching issues based on Zou Lufeng's report.

### 彻底清除教条主义  坚决反对修正主义  人民大学开始教学大改革

　　彻底清除教条主义  坚决反对修正主义
　　人民大学开始教学大改革
    新华社17日讯　中国人民大学整风运动已进入贯彻社会主义建设总路线，进行教学改革的大整大改阶段。副校长邹鲁风16日在全校师生大会上就这个问题做了动员报告。
    这次大整大改是在以反对个人主义为中心的思想革命的基础上进行的。早在3月间，这个学校就展开了大整大改的准备工作，到5月初，学校的中共党委和各系党总支首先抓住解放思想这一环节，通过教师座谈会交心会等形式，解除顾虑，暴露思想。同时，还组织教师深入实际，到各业务部门了解实际情况。财政经济方面的七个系已和北京市人民委员会各局建立了协作关系，教师们分别参加业务部门有关的会议和调查研究工作，业务部门给教学方面提供资料和情况，业务部门的领导人员到学校讲课、作专题报告。政治经济学教研室、贸易经济教研室教师在讲社会主义商业的性质时，课后带领学生去天桥商场参观，回来后就组织学生进行讨论。审判法教研室运用了“假法庭”实习作业法，由学生担任“审判长”“陪审员”“被告”“原告”和“律师”等，对一些案件进行“审理”。这些活动大大地解放了教师的思想，并增强了对教学内容大整大改的信心。邹鲁风在16日的大会上指出，这次大整大改的目的是：坚决贯彻鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总路线，进一步贯彻理论与实际相结合、教育与生产相结合、知识分子与工农相结合、脑力劳动与体力劳动相结合的方针，彻底清除教学中的教条主义，坚决反对修正主义，使学校的工作全面大跃进，以便为国家培养更多更好的高等学校政治理论教师和建设人材，适应全国生产大跃进和技术革命的新形势的需要。整改的中心环节是教学和科学研究。
    邹鲁风说：这次整改要以彻底的革命精神大破大立，而不要采取改良的方法。要进一步与国家的有关业务部门密切结合，按照国家社会主义建设的实际需要彻底地改革教学内容，绝不保守已经过时而大大落后于实际的课程体系。
    怎样有效地改革教学？邹鲁风在报告中提出的办法是，除了要继续发动群众大鸣大放外，决定充分利用校内校外的各种力量来揭发问题，再以务虚务实相结合的精神展开大辩论，统一思想认识，提出新的教学计划、教学内容改革规划、科学研究规划、个人红专规划，在此基础上全校再提出全盘的纲领性的规划。
    全校教师将根据邹鲁风的报告就教学问题展开大辩论。
