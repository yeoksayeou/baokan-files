    People of All Nationalities Joyfully Sing of the Great Leap Forward
    A "Five Million People, Five Songs" movement is vigorously developing among workers, peasants, students, and cadres in Yunnan Province.
    The five songs are: "Bring Out Revolutionary Drive," "Red Motherland Advances Courageously," "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind," "Socialism is Good," and "March of the Young Workers." In rural areas, they also sing "Ode to the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program."
    Now, at water conservancy construction sites, people can hear peasants singing "Bring Out Revolutionary Drive" while pushing earth onto the dam, working even more happily.

    各族人民欢唱跃进
    一个五百万人五歌运动正在云南省的工人、农民、学生和干部中蓬勃开展。
    这五支歌是：“拿出革命干劲来”、“红色的祖国奋勇前进”、“东风压倒西风”、“社会主义好”和“青年工人进行曲”，在农村还要唱“歌唱农业纲要四十条”。
    现在，水库工地上，人们可以听到农民一边唱着“拿出革命干劲来”，一边推土上坝，劳动得更加快活。
