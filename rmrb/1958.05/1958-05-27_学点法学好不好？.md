Is it good to learn some law?
    Some people say: It's not good. Look, among the right-wingers who are anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, aren't there many "jurists" and judicial personnel? They have studied law, what good is it?
    True. Many right-wingers have studied law. And it can be said that if you don't study law well, it can easily make you a conservative, even degenerate into a reactionary. But didn't Marx and Lenin both study law? Why were they revolutionaries? The problem is not whether you study law, but what position, viewpoint, and method you use to study law, how you apply law after studying it, and who you serve. If you use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to study law, study Marxist-Leninist jurisprudence, and use law to serve the revolution and socialism, to protect the people and oppose the reactionaries, then you will absolutely not become a right-winger. Perhaps some people say this: Of course, not everyone who has studied law becomes a right-winger, but not all revolutionaries have studied law. Learning some law, even if it doesn't hurt, may not have any benefits.
    I say: It is beneficial to learn some law, and it is a shortcoming not to learn some law, especially for leading cadres at all levels.
    As we all know, law is a tool of the ruling class and a weapon of dictatorship. Under the rule of the reactionary class, law is used to protect the interests of a small group of reactionaries, consolidate their rule, and oppress and exploit the working people. In our people's democratic country led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, law is used to protect the interests of the people, consolidate the people's regime, and suppress the reactionaries. For the reactionaries, law is our weapon of dictatorship. As long as the reactionaries have not been completely eliminated, we should not abandon this weapon. The right-wingers once attacked us for "having no law to rely on," not to have us firmly grasp this weapon and effectively strike at the reactionaries, but to adopt cunning tactics to seize this weapon, wanting us to formulate a large number of laws that would bind the people's hands and feet and benefit the reactionaries. Some people have soft scalps and can't resist this evil wind, so they fall with the wind and echo it. This is falling for their trick. But if because they clamor for law, we go to the other extreme and completely abandon law, that is also falling for their trick. Abandoning the weapon of dictatorship is detrimental to our rule. Some people get a headache as soon as they see the word law, and spit on it, showing a very disgusted and contemptuous expression. This is the result of them seeing the past law and the current law as the same thing. The past law was a weapon of the reactionary class's dictatorship, and the people suffered its cruel persecution for a long time, so of course they deeply hate it. Now, the people have gained power and grasped the weapon of dictatorship, the nature and role of law have changed, but people's ideological development often lags behind objective reality, and their view of law has not changed. Looking at new things with old eyes is called anachronism.
    For the people themselves, law is also necessary. It clearly tells us: what we should do, what we should not do, how we should do it, and how we should not do it. As Lenin said: "Legislation is an instruction calling on people to do extensive practical work." Law is one of the means to realize policies and guidelines, and it embodies policies and guidelines. Without law, relying solely on policies and guidelines, we can still make revolution and construction; but with law, because it makes people have a unified understanding and unified action on policies and guidelines, we can avoid detours, make fewer mistakes, and effectively carry out revolution and construction. Of course, when the conditions are not ripe, messing around with some inappropriate laws, still sticking to the original laws when the actual situation has changed, or not flexibly applying the law according to principles, but mechanically applying it and executing it rigidly, are all detrimental to revolution and construction. What laws need to be formulated, what laws need to be preserved, what laws need to be implemented, and how to implement laws, should be different according to time, place, and conditions; they should be adapted to the time, adapted to the place, and adapted to the circumstances. We must remember Lenin's instruction: "In any case, we should not restrict ourselves with a uniform and rigid format."
    How can we grasp and use the weapon of dictatorship well? This requires learning some law.
    Jurisprudence is a discipline that systematically studies law, taking law as its research object. It mainly studies the essence, tasks, and functions of law, studies the foundation of the emergence of law, the process of development, and the future prospects, studies how to formulate law and use law to solve problems in actual life and actual struggle, and summarizes historical and realistic struggle experiences, and so on. Without learning some law, and basically clarifying these issues, you will make mistakes. The legal profession, like other scientific fields, also has various schools of thought, with a hundred schools of thought contending, and each person has their own set. But in the final analysis, there are only two factions. One faction is the materialist faction, and the other faction is the idealist faction; one faction serves the working people, and the other faction serves the reactionary class; one faction uses the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method, and the other faction uses the non-Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method. If you mistakenly worship a teacher or go astray, you will make mistakes. For example: if you do not understand that law is a tool of the ruling class's rule, a weapon of dictatorship, and serves the ruling class, but believe in fallacies such as "law is the embodiment of reason," "is an objectively existing natural law," "is absolute, rational, and super-class," then you will inevitably fail to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and treat everyone "equally." Even be infinitely lenient to counter-revolutionary elements, but readily punish the people by law. This is exactly the opposite of Chairman Mao's instruction: "To the enemy, we use the method of dictatorship," "to the people, it is the opposite, not using the method of coercion, but using the method of democracy." If you do not understand that law is built on a certain social economic base, serves the economic base, and changes with the changes of the economic base, but believe in the fallacy that "law is an eternal truth," then you will inevitably move dogmas, stick to conventions, and even embrace the old law of the reactionary class, and regard it as a golden rule, which in economy, hinders the development of the productive forces, and in politics, is not conducive to the consolidation of the people's regime. If you do not understand that law is generated from actual life and actual struggle, and is used to solve problems in actual life and actual struggle, then you will inevitably build a car behind closed doors and shoot without a target. Like some people who do not understand the current property relations and family life in Chinese society, and come to engage in inheritance law, of course, it is a mismatch. In short, if you do not fully understand jurisprudence, and you are clueless in the specific application of law, then you will inevitably be fooled by others, and consciously or unconsciously make mistakes of varying degrees. Therefore, it is said that learning some law is beneficial, and not learning law is a shortcoming.
    How should we learn? First of all, we must use the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method to learn, learn the Marxist-Leninist theory of state and law, and learn the practical experience of socialist countries regarding law. The bourgeois jurisprudence and the law of capitalist countries, for the sake of comparison and criticism, must also be understood to some extent. But we must first have the Marxist-Leninist position, viewpoint, and method, and first learn the Marxist-Leninist theory, so as not to be deceived and captured. Learning theory cannot be learned only from books, the most important thing is to combine theory with practice. Separated from practice, theory becomes dogma, becomes empty talk, not only can it not effectively solve any practical problems, but it will have harmful results. Separated from practice, we will not truly creatively consider and solve problems. If we dare to think and dare to speak, it can only be reverie and idle talk. We should learn from Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is most adept at combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the actual practice of the Chinese revolution, and creatively solving practical problems. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, we have original things in all aspects, and the same is true in the use of the weapon of law. Just taking the specific measure of "death sentence with a reprieve" as an example, no country has ever had it. Therefore, learning jurisprudence must also learn Chairman Mao's method and read Chairman Mao's works.
    Finally, let me mention in passing that learning some law has another benefit, which is that it can enable you to express your meaning more accurately when expressing your meaning in language or writing. Therefore, Stalin once advocated that the committee for revising the textbook on political economy should also include an experienced jurist to check the accuracy of the wording.

    学点法学好不好？
  　张友渔
    学点法学好不好？
    有人说：不好。你瞧，在反党、反人民、反社会主义的右派分子里头，不是有许多“法学家”和司法人员吗？他们是学过法学的吧，有什么好处？
    不错。右派分子不少是学过法学的。并且可以说，学法学，学不好，容易使你成为保守派、甚至堕落为反动派。但是，马克思、列宁不都是学过法学的吗？为什么他们却是革命派呢？问题不在你学不学法学，而在你用什么立场、观点、方法来学法学，学了法学怎样运用，为谁服务。如果你用马列主义的立场、观点、方法来学法学，学的是马列主义的法学，学了法学是为革命服务，是为社会主义服务，是运用它保护人民，而反对反动派，那你就绝对不会成为右派。也许有人这样说：固然，学过法学的人不一定都成为右派，但是，革命派并不都是学过法学的人。学点法学纵使没有坏处，也未必有什么好处。
    我说：学点法学有好处，不学点法学是缺点，特别对各级领导干部来说，是这样。
    像我们大家所熟知的那样，法是统治阶级统治的工具，专政的武器。在反动阶级统治下，法是用来保护反动阶级一小撮人的利益，巩固他们的统治，而压迫和剥削劳动人民的；在我们这个工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主国家，法是用来保护人民利益，巩固人民政权，而压迫反动派的。对反动派来说，法是我们专政的武器。只要反动派还没有完全消灭，我们就不应当抛掉这个武器。右派分子曾经攻击我们“无法可依”，并不是要我们掌握牢这个武器，有效地打击反动派，而是采取狡狯的战术来夺取这个武器，要我们大量地制定一些束缚人民手脚而有利于反动派的法。有些人头皮软，顶不住这股歪风，随风倒，跟着嚷。这就上了他们的当。但是如果因为他们嚷着要法，我们就走向另一个极端，完全不要法，那同样是上了他们的当。抛掉专政的武器，对我们的统治是不利的。有些人一瞧见法这个字就头痛，就吐唾沫，表现出十分厌恶，十分鄙弃的神气。这是由于他们把过去的法和现在的法看成一样的东西的结果。过去的法是反动阶级专政的武器，人民长时期受着它的残酷的迫害，当然要对它深恶痛绝了。现在，人民获得了政权，掌握了法这个专政的武器，法的性质和作用已经变了，但是，人们的思想的发展常落后于客观实际，对于法的看法，还没有改变。拿老眼光看新事物，这叫做时代错误。
    对于人民自己来说，法也是必要的。它明确告诉我们：应当做什么，不应当做什么，应当怎么做，不应当怎么做。像列宁所说：“法令，这是一种号召人们去做广泛实际事业的指令”。法是实现政策方针的手段之一，它是体现政策方针的。没有法，光凭政策方针办事，也可以革命，也可以建设；但是有了法，由于使人们对政策方针有了一致认识，一致行动，就更能不走弯路，少犯错误，有效地进行革命和建设。当然，在条件没有成熟的时候，乱搞一些不适当的法律，实际情况已经变化仍然墨守原有的法律，或者，对于法律不是根据原则灵活运用，而是死搬硬套，机械执行，都是不利于革命和建设的。需要制定什么法律，保存什么法律，执行什么法律，以及怎样执行法律，应当是因时、因地、因条件而有所不同；应当是因时制宜、因地制宜、因事制宜。我们必须记着列宁的指示：“无论如何，不应当用千篇一律的死板格式来拘束自己”。
    怎样才能把法这个专政的武器掌握好，运用好呢？这就需要学点法学。
    法学是把法做为研究对象，系统地研究法的一门学问。它主要是研究法的本质、任务和作用，研究法产生的基础、发展的过程和将来的前途，研究怎样制定法、运用法来解决实际生活、实际斗争里头的问题，以及总结历史的、现实的斗争经验等等。不学点法学，把这些问题基本上搞清楚，你就会犯错误。法学界和别的科学界一样，也存在着各种学派，百家争鸣，各人有各人的一套。但是归根到底，不外两派。一派是唯物派，一派是唯心派；一派是给劳动人民服务的，一派是给反动阶级服务的；一派用的是马列主义的立场、观点、方法，一派用的是非马列主义的立场、观点、方法。如果你错拜了老师，误入了歧途，你就会犯错误。举例来说：如果你不懂得法是统治阶级统治的工具，专政的武器，是为统治阶级服务的，而相信“法是理性的体现”，“是客观存在的自然法则”，“是绝对的、合理的、超阶级的”等等谬说，那你就难免敌我不分，“一视同仁”。甚至对反革命分子宽大无边，而对人民却动不动就绳之以法。这和毛主席的指示：“对敌人说来是用专政的方法”，“对人民说来则与此相反，不是用强迫的方法，而是用民主的方法”，恰恰背道而驰。如果你不懂得法是建筑在一定的社会的经济基础之上，为经济基础服务，并且随着经济基础的变化而变化的，而相信“法是永恒不变的真理”的谬说，那你就难免搬运教条，墨守陈规，甚至抱着反动阶级的旧法，奉为金科玉律，在经济上，妨碍生产力的发展，在政治上，不利于人民政权的巩固。如果你不懂得法是从实际生活、实际斗争里头产生，又用来解决实际生活、实际斗争里头的问题的，那你就难免闭门造车，无的放矢。像有的人不了解目前中国社会的财产关系，家庭生活，而来搞什么继承法，当然驴头不对马嘴。总之，如果你完全不懂得法学，在法的具体运用上，自己心中无数，那就难免上别人的当，自觉或不自觉地犯或大或小的错误。所以说，学点法学有好处，不学法学是缺点。
    应当怎么样学呢？首先，是用马列主义的立场、观点、方法来学，学马列主义的国家和法的理论，学社会主义各国关于法的实践的经验。资产阶级的法学，资本主义国家的法，为了比较，为了批判，也要懂得一些。但是必须先有了马列主义的立场、观点、方法，先学得马列主义的理论，才不致受欺骗，被俘虏。学理论，不能光从书本子上去学，最主要的是要理论结合实际。脱离实际，理论就成了教条，就成了空论，不仅不能有效地解决任何实际问题，反而会发生有害的结果。脱离实际，也就不会真正创造性地考虑问题，解决问题。如果敢想、敢说，也只能是冥想、清谈。我们应当向毛主席学习。毛主席最善于把马列主义的普遍真理同中国革命实线结合起来，创造性地解决实际问题。在毛主席的正确领导下，我们在各方面，都有独创的东西，在法这个武器的运用上也一样。只就“死刑缓期执行”这个具体措施来说，就不是任何国家曾经有过的。因此，学法学也必须学毛主席的方法，读毛主席的著作。
    末了，附带提一下，学点法学还有另外一个好处，就是能够使你在用语言或文字表达你的意思时，更准确一些。所以斯大林曾经主张在修改政治经济学教科书的委员会里头，也要包括一位有经验的法学家来检查措词的确切性。
