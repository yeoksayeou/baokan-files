Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 24th: Through the Yellow River Diversion to Wei River Irrigation Project, the rolling Yellow River water flowed through the Wei River and into the Grand Canal on the 16th, reaching the Hebei Plain. The water volume increased from the original twenty-odd cubic meters per second to one hundred and twenty-six cubic meters per second. Now, all the sluice gates have been filled with water. More than ten million mu of land along the river that had been suffering from drought for a long time has been irrigated, and the industrial and civilian water use in Tianjin has also been further improved.

During this year's Great Leap Forward in production, a large area of paddy fields was newly developed along both banks of the canal, nearly five million mu in the Cangxian Prefecture alone. However, from September last year to April this year, these areas had not experienced a thorough rain. The river water was depleted, wheat seedlings lacked water for irrigation, and paddy fields had even less water for raising seedlings. Cangxian Prefecture needed to cultivate seedlings on 250,000 mu, but due to the water shortage, only 130,000 mu were cultivated by early May. Furthermore, in order to support Tianjin's urban water use, the farmers, with a spirit of self-sacrifice, closed all the openings along the river, allowing the mere twenty-odd flow units of water to flow to Tianjin. Therefore, most of the only 130,000 mu of seedlings relied on extracting groundwater for irrigation, but the water demand of the seedlings was large, and the groundwater far from met the needs.

After the Yellow River water rolled into the plain, everyone was excited. Wang Shuqiao, a seventy-year-old man from Lianhua Pond Township in Nanpi County, said, "If it weren't for Chairman Mao's leadership, we would never have seen such good water in our lifetime." All townships in Cangxian County established paddy field project headquarters. In Muguantun Township alone, more than 5,000 people were mobilized to organize paddy fields and irrigate and wash the land.

### 黄河水流进了河北平原

    黄河水流进了河北平原
    据新华社天津24日电　通过引黄济卫灌溉工程，滚滚黄水经过卫河于16日流进南运河到了河北大平原。水量由原来的二十多秒公方，增加到一百二十六秒公方。现在，各闸都已上水。沿河一千多万亩久遭干旱的土地获得了灌溉，天津市的工业与市民用水也有了进一步的改善。
    在今年生产大跃进中，运河两岸新开发了大量稻田，仅沧县专区境内就近五百万亩。但从去年9月到今年4月，这些地区没下过透雨，河水枯竭，麦苗缺水灌溉，稻田更加无水育秧。沧县专区需要育秧二十五万亩，因为水缺，直到5月初才育秧十三万亩，又因为支援天津城市用水，农民抱着自我牺牲的精神，把沿河的口子都闸了，让仅有二十多个流量的水流向天津市。因而仅有的十三万亩秧苗，多半依靠挖掘地下水来浇灌，但秧苗需水量大，地下水远不能满足需要。
    当黄水滚滚进入平原之后，人人心情激动。南皮县莲花池乡七十多岁的老人王树桥说：“不是毛主席领导，那辈子也看不到这样的好水。”沧县各乡建立了稻田工程指挥部，木官屯乡一个乡就出动了五千多人，整理稻田，灌水洗地。
