Leaving the Office to Cultivate "Experimental Plots"
    Taiyuan Technical Personnel Find the Road to Redness and Expertise

    (Our newspaper's dispatch from Taiyuan) Engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines in Taiyuan City are treating "experimental plots" as a road to becoming both red and expert, and as an important method to improve technical leadership.

    In the past month during the rectification phase in Taiyuan, along with leading cadres working on "experimental plots," there has been a surge of engineering and technical personnel also working on "experimental plots." In mid-March, chief engineers from fourteen factories, including the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant and the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Plant, initiated a call to all technical personnel in the city to "Leave the office, and temper yourselves into engineers who are both red and expert through labor." Subsequently, engineering and technical personnel from twenty units, including the Shanxi Machine Tool Plant and the Taiyuan Mining Machinery Plant, together with Party, government, labor union, and Youth League leaders, established "experimental furnaces," "experimental workshops," and "experimental mine pits." Their general approach was to select weak production processes and spend about two days each week working alongside workers on the production line. Some even lived and ate with the workers. During this period, they deeply realized that "experimental plots" are not, as some people say, only suitable for old cadres who are unfamiliar with the business and technology, and not very beneficial to technical personnel. On the contrary, "experimental plots" can quickly and accurately solve difficulties in technical work. Gao Zhenyue, the chief engineer of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's United Processing Plant, considers his month-long "experimental plot" experience as a brand new chapter in his many years of technical work. This year, their plant spent a lot of money to build a curing pit to accelerate the hardening of concrete structures. However, after it was put into production, the production efficiency was much lower than open-air operations. The workers complained that they could not complete their quotas, saying, "The curing pit has become a harming pit." What was the crux of the problem? This was still a mystery to the technical personnel. In late March, Gao Zhenyue, along with the plant director and Party secretary, established an "experimental plot" in the curing pit. In the first seven days of labor, they discovered more than twenty technical problems affecting production. The most serious one was that the vibration table in the curing pit was not installed properly, which interfered with the two cranes so that they could only function as one, resulting in very low production efficiency. In fact, the workers had discovered this problem during the installation process and had made rationalization proposals. However, due to a lack of on-site experience, their opinions were not adopted. This time, they adopted the suggestions of the masses and reinstalled the vibration table, which increased production efficiency by more than four times. Taiyuan Leather Factory, for the eight years since liberation, had not been selected for export because the surface of the cowhide was soft. Recently, the chief engineer, Ren Chengshi, found out during his work alongside the workers in the workshop that the workers had mixed up the formulas for soaking two different types of leather. He promptly corrected the workers' operating methods, and the leather quality quickly reached export standards.

    These engineering and technical personnel have absorbed the workers' operating experience and enriched their knowledge and skills through "experimental plots." Cui Baoyu, the chief engineer of the Taiyuan Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Construction Engineering, discovered on his first day of labor at the Hexi Precast Plant that the cracking phenomenon of large pre-stressed reinforced concrete components was very serious. However, because he had not been on site for a long time, he could not come up with a solution immediately. He was inspired during a discussion with the old workers at night. It turned out that the steam curing equipment was not installed properly, and the steam could not evenly penetrate the concrete structure, causing cracks. He absorbed the workers' opinions, modified the equipment, and basically avoided quality accidents. Cui Baoyu said with emotion: "I have been an architect for fifteen years, and today I realize the truth that there is science and technology only with labor." Xia Yang, the deputy chief engineer of the state-owned Xing'an Chemical Materials Plant, could only determine the length and angle of the material boards by constantly referring to technical books when cutting them with the workers. However, the workers could cut the raw materials to the right size with ease. After seeing the workers' operating experience, he realized that he was too bookish.

    Many engineering and technical personnel dared to revise those unreasonable rules and regulations after participating in actual production. In the past, the engineers of the Refractory Materials Branch of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant insisted that the workers reduce the amount of water in the brick blanks to improve the quality of refractory bricks. However, the workers felt that this was both laborious and inefficient, and had made many rationalization proposals without effect. When the engineers who formulated these operating procedures personally participated in the operation, they felt that: less water, hard clay, and it hurt their backs and arms. So they quickly revised the inappropriate operating procedures with the workers and started to improve the quality of refractory materials by improving the tools.

    These engineering and technical personnel gradually became close to the workers in food, lodging and labor. At first, they disliked the workers' lack of hygiene and the noise of the workers who changed shifts at night. But they soon realized that this was exactly what they needed to change, and they took the initiative to approach the workers. Guo Gongning, an engineer of the Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company, felt that the air in the construction workers' dormitory was bad and was very unhappy when he first arrived. After living there for a while, he realized that these dormitories were designed by himself, with low houses and only one small window, and the air was not circulating. He suddenly realized that it was not that the workers did not like to be hygienic, but that he had not considered the hygienic conditions for the workers when designing.

    A large number of engineering and technical personnel lead production by participating in production, which has brought about new changes in the relationship between the science department and the production workshop. In the past, when workers encountered difficulties in production, they often delayed important matters because they could not find engineers. Now, engineers take the initiative to find workers to solve problems. In the past, it generally took the Central Laboratory of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant a week to get the results of testing the quality of open-hearth steelmaking. Recently, engineer Li Xinmin established an "experimental furnace" in this workshop, and made a test conclusion on the spot in a few minutes for each furnace of steel produced. And immediately told the workers the advantages and disadvantages of this furnace of steel. Therefore, the scrap rate has been greatly reduced. The workers said: "In the past, you were picking on our faults, now you are guiding our production."

### 走出办公室　去种“试验田”  太原技术人员找到红专大道

　　走出办公室　去种“试验田”
    太原技术人员找到红专大道
    本报太原电　太原市厂矿企业中的工程技术人员，把“试验田”当成了自己红透专深的道路和改进技术领导的重要方法。
    太原市各厂矿在整改阶段的最近一个月中，在领导干部搞“试验田”的同时，也出现了工程技术人员搞“试验田”的热潮。3月中旬，太原钢铁厂、太原重型机器厂等十四个厂的总工程师向全市技术人员发起了“走出办公室、在劳动中把自己锻炼成又红又专的工程师”的倡议。随即有山西机床厂、太原矿山机器厂等二十个单位的工程技术人员同党政工团领导干部搞了“试验炉”、“试验车间”、“试验矿坑”。他们一般的作法是选择生产上的薄弱工序，每周抽出两天左右的时间到生产现场和工人一起操作；有的连住宿、吃饭都和工人在一起。他们在这段时期内深深体会到“试验田”并不是像有些人说的仅适用于不熟悉业务、技术的老干部，对技术人员的好处不大。相反的“试验田”能使技术工作上的困难迅速而准确地得到解决。太原钢铁厂联合加工厂总工程师高振岳把一个月“试验田”生活当成自己从事多年技术工作以来崭新的一页。他们厂今年花了好多钱新建了一座养生坑，是想加速混凝土结构的凝干。可是投入生产以后，生产效率反比露天操作低的多了。工人们完不成定额就埋怨说：“养生坑成了害人坑”。问题的症结是什么呢？这在技术人员中还是个疑团。高振岳在3月下旬和厂长、党委书记在养生坑建立了“试验田”。他们在开始劳动的七天中就发现了二十多个影响生产的技术问题。其中最严重的是养生坑震动台安装的不合适，干扰得两部吊车只能顶一部用，生产效率很低。其实这个问题早在安装过程中工人们就发现了，并且提过合理化建议。只是他们缺少现场体会，没有采纳工人的意见。这次他们采纳了群众的建议，重新安装了震动台，生产效率比原来提高了四倍多。太原皮革厂解放八年来因为牛皮表面松软，几次准备出口而未选中；最近总工程师任承时到车间跟班劳动中才发现原来工人们把泡制两种不同皮种的药方混用了。他及时校正了工人操作方法，皮质很快达到出国标准。
    这些工程技术人员通过“试验田”吸取了工人的操作经验，丰富和充实了自己的知识和技能。建筑工程部太原工程局主任工程师崔宝玉在河西预制厂参加劳动的第一天，就发现大型预应力钢筋混凝土构件裂纹现象很严重，可是由于自己长期没有到现场，一时拿不出办法来。他晚上睡觉时和老工人座谈中得到了启示。原来蒸气养生设备安装的不合适，蒸气不能均匀地渗到混凝土结构里，造成裂纹。他吸收了工人们的意见，改装了设备，基本上避免了质量事故。崔宝玉感慨地说：“我当了十五年建筑师了，在今天才体会到有劳动才有科学技术的真理。”国营兴安化学材料厂副总工程师夏阳在和工人一起切割料板时，随时参考着技术书籍才能确定长短和角度。但工人们却能信手把原料切割得大小正合适。他在看到工人操作的经验后才认识到自己的书呆气太严重了。
    许多工程技术人员参加了实际生产以后，才勇于修订那些不合理的规章制度。太原钢铁厂耐火材料分厂的工程师们过去一味要求工人以减少砖坯水量的办法，来提高耐火砖的质量。但工人们感到这样既费劲、效率又低，曾提过许多合理化建议没有效果。当给工人们拟定这种操作规程的工程师亲自参加操作时才感到：水分少、粘土硬、打得腰酸胳膊痛。于是他们很快和工人一起修订了不合适的操作规程，并从改进工具着手提高耐火材料的质量。
    这些工程技术人员在和工人同食、同住、同劳动中感情逐渐和工人融洽在一起了。起初，他们嫌工人不卫生、晚上换班的工人扰乱了睡觉。但他们很快意识到这正是自己改造的内容，便主动和工人接近。太原市政工程公司工程师郭功宁初到建筑工人宿舍觉得空气不好，很不愉快。住了些时才发觉这些宿舍是自己设计的，低矮的房子，只有一个小窗户，空气不流通。他猛省到不是工人不爱讲卫生，而是自己设计时就没有为工人从卫生条件着想。
    大批工程技术人员以参加生产来领导生产，使科室工作与生产车间的关系有了新的变化。过去工人们生产上遇到困难时往往因为找不到工程师耽误了大事。现在是工程师主动找工人解决问题。太原钢铁厂中央试验室过去为平炉炼钢车间化验品种质量的时间，一般要一星期以后才有结果。最近工程师李新民在这个车间建立了“试验炉”，每炼出一炉钢，在当场用几分钟就作出化验结论。并且立即把这炉钢的优缺点讲给工人。因此废品率大大降低。工人们说：“过去你们是挑我们的毛病，现在是指导我们生产”。
