    Daydreaming

    The "Committee of Public Safety" set up by the French ultra-colonialists in Algeria has repeatedly boasted that many Muslims support this organization. One spokesman even claimed that even the "illegal elements" of the Algerian armed forces had declared their loyalty to the "Committee of Public Safety."

    The Algerian people have fought for more than three years against colonialism. Would they "pledge allegiance" to the ultra-colonialists? Of course, the facts are not like this at all. The Algerian National Liberation Front has already issued a statement that they will strengthen their struggle to deal with the new situation in Algeria.

    Obviously, the "Committee of Public Safety" made this absurd statement that no one would believe, just daydreaming. It is clear that colonialism is about to completely collapse, but they dream that the future of colonialism is still quite wonderful. It is clear that the struggle of the Algerian people is becoming stronger and stronger, but they dream that as soon as they carry out a coup, the Algerian people will immediately obediently pledge allegiance to them!

    白天做梦
    法国极端殖民主义分子在阿尔及利亚搞起来的“救国委员会”，一再吹嘘有很多穆斯林拥护这个组织。有一个发言人甚至宣称，连阿尔及利亚武装的“非法之徒”也已经宣布他们忠于“救国委员会”。
    阿尔及利亚人民为了反对殖民主义而战斗了三年多，难道会向极端殖民主义者“效忠”吗？事实当然决不是这样，阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线已经发表声明，他们将加强战斗，来对付在阿尔及利亚出现的新的形势。
    显然，“救国委员会”发表这种荒唐得没有人会相信的声明，不过是白天做梦。明明殖民主义就要彻底完蛋了，他们却梦见殖民主义前途还颇为美妙。明明阿尔及利亚人民的斗争越来越加强，他们却梦见他们一搞政变，阿尔及利亚人民就马上乖乖地向他们效忠呢！
