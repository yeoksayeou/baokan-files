Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 27th: The Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission and the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League recently jointly held a symposium to support youth inventions and creations. More than ten veteran scientists visited the exhibition of over 170 physical inventions and creations by Tianjin youth and listened to the representatives of nine young innovators introduce their research processes and achievements. The veteran scientists present unanimously agreed that young experts are a promising force in the current technological innovation and promotion of scientific research.

    Ma Guorong, a young technician at the Renli Egg Products Factory, tried many methods to eliminate Salmonella in egg powder. When he failed after 300 trials using the vacuum nitrogen filling method, some people advised him to give up, saying that his method had no scientific basis. However, he believed that scientific basis in the world is discovered by people in practice, and once he succeeded in the experiment, the scientific basis would be there. With the support of the Party and Youth League organizations, he experimented another twenty-two times and finally succeeded. Liang Shukai, a young man from the Tianjin Textile and Dyeing Factory who invented a method of dyeing cloth without dyes, heard that "wool diazotization can change color." He successfully used this method to dye wool fabrics and is now conducting experiments on dyeing silk.

    The communist style of these young people, who dare to think and act, is admired by the veteran scientists. Zhang Guofan, director of the Tianjin Municipal Science and Technology Commission and president of Tianjin University, said at the symposium: Seeing these new inventions and creations by young people makes me feel that the primary issue for scientists is ideological liberation. Why are major inventions and creations throughout history mostly made by young people with little education? I think it's because they are not constrained by textbook knowledge and authoritative experts. Therefore, how the older generation of scientists can liberate their thinking from the influence of scientific mystification is a very urgent issue at present. Chen Diaofu, director of the Tianjin Chemical Research Institute, said: At this meeting, I saw the respectability and loveliness of the younger generation. Chen Diaofu believes that these young people have three points that are worth learning for veteran scientists: First, they have no burden of fame and fortune in their thinking; second, they have unwavering perseverance; third, no matter how big or small the problem is, as long as it is a key to production, they put effort into research.

    敢想敢干　后生可爱
    青年人在党的支持下发扬独创精神
    据新华社天津27日电　天津市科学工作委员会和共青团天津市委员会最近联合召开支持青年发明创造座谈会，十多位老科学家参观了天津青年一百七十多项发明创造的实物展览，并听取了九名青年革新家的代表介绍他们的研究过程和取得的成就。到会的老科学家一致认为：青年专家是当前开展技术革新和推动科学研究中的一支很可指望的力量。
    仁立蛋品厂青年技术员马国荣曾试用许多办法消灭蛋粉中的沙门氏菌。当他采用真空充氮法试验了三百次都未成功的时候，有人就劝他放弃，说他这个办法没有科学根据。但他认为世界上的科学根据都是人们在实践中发现的，等他试验成功了，科学根据也就有了。在党、团组织的支持下，他又试验了二十二次，终于获得成功。发明不用染料染色布的天津织染厂青年梁树楷，听说“羊毛重氮化可以变色”，他用这种方法染毛织品获得成功，正在进行染丝绸的试验。
    这些青年人敢想敢干的共产主义风格，使老科学家们非常钦佩。天津市科学工作委员会主任、天津大学校长张国藩在座谈会上说：看到青年们这些新的发明创造，使我感到科学家一个首要的问题就是思想解放。为什么古今中外的重大发明创造，大都是出自学历不深的青年呢？我想就是他们不受书本知识和权威专家的约束。因此老一辈的科学家们，如何把自己的思想从科学神秘化的影响下解放出来，是当前很迫切的问题。天津化工研究所所长陈调甫说：在这次会上，使我看到后生的可敬和可爱。陈调甫认为，这些青年有三点值得老科学家学习：第一，他们思想上没有名利包袱；第二，有不屈不挠的恒心；第三，不管大小问题，只要是生产关键，就下功夫研究。
