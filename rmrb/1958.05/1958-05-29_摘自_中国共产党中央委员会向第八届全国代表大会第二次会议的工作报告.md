    As long as all twenty-odd provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, more than 180 special districts and autonomous prefectures, more than 2,000 counties and autonomous counties, more than 80,000 townships and towns, more than 100,000 handicraft cooperatives, and more than 700,000 agricultural cooperatives can correctly and fully exert their initiative in developing industry, then, in a relatively short period, all kinds of factories will be distributed throughout the country like stars in the sky. And the development of our industry will certainly be much faster than relying solely on a few large enterprises managed by the central government. In this way, the future will inevitably be: First, to accelerate the process of national industrialization; second, to accelerate the process of agricultural mechanization; third, to accelerate the process of narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas.

    只要全国二十几个省、直辖市和自治区，一百八十多个专区、自治州，二千多个县、自治县，八万多个乡、镇，十万多个手工业合作社，七十多万个农业合作社，都能够在发展工业方面正确地充分地发挥积极性，那末，在一个较短的时期内，各种工厂就会像星罗棋布那样分布在全国各地，而我国工业的发展，当然要比只靠中央管理的若干个大企业快得多。这样，前途必然是：一、加速国家工业化的进程；二、加速农业机械化的进程；三、加速缩小城乡差别的进程。
