    Using Plateau Lakes as Reservoirs
    Dali Builds the Xier River Cascade Power Station
    The Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province is utilizing the famous plateau lake, Erhai Lake, as a natural reservoir to construct a cascade power station with an installed capacity of 200,000 kilowatts on the Xier River, the outlet of Erhai Lake.
    Currently, the second-stage power station of the Xier River cascade power station, with an installed capacity of 14,000 kilowatts, has already started construction. Efforts are being made to install 2,000 kilowatts before "October 1st" to supply the electricity urgently needed for the current development of local industry in the autonomous prefecture. The first-stage power station, with an installed capacity of 20,000 to 25,000 kilowatts, will also begin construction in the third quarter.
    At the same time, the autonomous prefecture will also excavate water diversion tunnels totaling more than 13 kilometers in length among the surrounding mountains of Erhai Lake, diverting 150 million to 250 million cubic meters of Erhai Lake water annually to irrigate nearly 500,000 mu of farmland in Binchuan, Yongjian Hui Autonomous County, Weishan Yi Autonomous County, Dengchuan and other four counties. Currently, the preparatory work for this project is underway and is expected to be completed next year. (Xinhua News Agency)

    利用高原湖泊作蓄水库
    大理兴建西洱河梯级电站
    云南省大理白族自治州利用著名高原湖泊洱海作为天然蓄水库，在洱海的出水口西洱河上兴建装机容量二十万瓩的梯级电站。
    现在，西洱河梯级电站中，装机容量为一万四千瓩的二级电站已经动工，争取在“十、一”前先装二千瓩，供应自治州当前发展地方工业中迫切需要的电力。装机容量二万到二万五千瓩的一级电站，也将在第三季度动工。
    和这同时，自治州还将在环绕洱海的丛山峻岭中间，开凿总长十三公里多的引水隧道，每年引一亿五千万到二亿五千万公方的洱海水，灌溉宾川、永建回族自治县、巍山彝族自治县、邓川等四县将近五十万亩的农田。现在，这项工程已进行施工准备工作，预计明年即可完成。　　（新华社）
