American Blacks in the Wave of Unemployment

　　Amidst the increasingly severe economic recession in the United States, the broad working class of the United States is suffering from the deepening disasters of unemployment and poverty. Due to policies of racial discrimination, American blacks are particularly hard hit.

　　The "Wall Street Journal" admitted on April 23: "Blacks are the first to be laid off. Because blacks lack priority opportunities for employment, they often engage in unskilled labor and some of the jobs most susceptible to economic recession."

　　"U.S. News & World Report" stated on April 11: "It is no novelty that blacks are the first to suffer during economic recessions. Blacks are often the last hired and the first fired."

　　According to a report from the U.S. Bureau of the Census, in March, among the 7,209,000 colored workers in the United States, 1,035,000 were unemployed; that is, one out of every seven people was unemployed. Among the 60,300,000 white workers, 4,163,000 were unemployed, that is, one out of every fifteen people was unemployed.

　　According to official U.S. statistics, from October 1957 to March 1958, the unemployment rate for black workers increased from 6% to 16%. During the same period, the unemployment rate for white workers only increased from 3% to 7%.

　　Blacks are also the hardest hit in terms of reduced working hours and declining wages. For example, in February, 32% of black workers had only one to thirty-four hours of work per week. During the same period, white workers working less than thirty-five hours per week accounted for only 20% of the total number of white workers.

　　Since black workers' wages are, on average, 44% lower than those of white workers, black families encounter far greater difficulties than white families. Currently, many black families in large cities such as Detroit and Chicago are facing the crisis of being evicted by landlords.

　　失业浪潮中的美国黑人
    在美国经济衰退日益严重的形势下，美国广大工人阶级遭受着失业和贫困加深的灾难。由于种族歧视政策，美国黑人受到的打击特别沉重。
    “华尔街日报”4月23日承认：“首先被解雇的是黑人。由于黑人缺乏受雇的优先机会，他们往往从事不需要熟练技术的劳动和一些最容易受经济衰退影响的工作。”
    “美国新闻与世界报道”4月11日称：“在经济衰退中，黑人首先蒙受打击，已经不是什么新奇的事了。最后受雇、最先被解雇的往往就是黑人。”
    根据美国国情普查局的一项报告，3月份在美国七百二十万零九千个有色人工人中，就有一百零三万五千人失业；这就是说，每七人中就有一人失业。而六千零三十万零一千个白种工人中有四百一十六万三千人失业，即每十五人中有一人失业。
    另据美国官方发表的统计数字，从1957年10月至1958年3月，黑人工人的失业率从6％增加到16％。而同一时期，白种工人的失业率只从3％增加到7％。
    从工作时间减少、工资递降这一方面看来，受打击最大的也是黑人。例如，2月间，32％的黑人工人每周只有一小时至三十四小时的工作。同一时期，每周工作为三十五小时以下的白种工人，只占白种工人总数的20％。
    由于黑人工人工资平均比白人少44％，黑人家庭所遭遇的困难远远地超过了白人家庭。目前，底特律、芝加哥等大都市的许多黑人家庭已经面临着被房东逐出的危机。
