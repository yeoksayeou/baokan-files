 Husband and Wife Reconcile and Make a Double Leap Forward
	Wen Huan

	In the Third Production Team of the Pioneer Commune in Jingbei Township, Jiangling, Hubei, there was a couple. The husband, Zhao Jinhe, was not very active in production. The wife, Hu Jiaming, was a production team leader loved by everyone. Hu Jiaming had struggled against her husband's backward thinking, speaking countless words, but to no avail. While other commune members started early and slept late to engage in the Great Leap Forward, Zhao Jinhe either went out to engage in sideline occupations or stayed at home idle, not working. When the commune launched a great airing of views and posted big-character posters, Hu Jiaming wrote a big-character poster about her husband and posted it in the commune's club.

	Old Zhao's thinking is backward,
	You repair the levee on the embankment,
	Not understanding any planning,
	Going to dig lotus roots off the embankment every day,
	Not accepting my suggestions,
	Acting strangely with many secrets.

	When Old Zhao saw the big-character poster, he went home and got angry at Hu Jiaming, saying, "If you have something to say, why not say it to my face? Why do you have to embarrass me and put up a big-character poster about me?" Hu Jiaming replied, "I've advised you countless times, why don't you correct yourself?" Zhao Jinhe was still not convinced, and he said, "If you can put one up, so can I." The next day, a new big-character poster appeared in the club:

	Last winter and this spring I went to the embankment,
	You had a lot of opinions,
	Now that you're the team leader,
	Arrogant and complacent, bullying me.
	After finishing work on the embankment,
	What's wrong with resting for two days?
	I feel upset after seeing the big-character poster,
	I hope everyone will judge fairly!

	After this big-character poster was put up, the whole team started discussing it. Some said, "Old Zhao is just backward. We're engaging in the Great Leap Forward, and he's engaging in regression. If everyone were like him, how could we complete this year's plan?" Some said, "He wants us to judge fairly, okay, let's give him a judgment," After a few days, the commentary bulletin published a commentary.

	Commune member Zhao Jinhe of the Third Team,
	Has the most peculiar thoughts,
	Not engaging in the Great Leap Forward himself,
	And dragging his wife down.
	Refusing to work and only digging lotus roots,
	Blaming his wife for being criticized,
	If he still doesn't correct himself now,
	We'll refute you on the big-character poster.

	After reading this big-character poster, Old Zhao couldn't sleep for several days, thinking it over and over. He ran to his uncle Wang Sandie's place and complained to Sandie: "Jiaming has changed her mind, and the masses support her." After listening, Sandie said to Jinhe, "Last year I often sat in the teahouse and didn't like to work, which was wrong of me. Now I've changed, but who knew you're still a sluggard. If you don't change again, I'll put up a big-character poster about you tomorrow." Jinhe ran east and ran west, and no one said he was right. Finally, he understood and regretted it, and said to his wife, "I'm not a spineless person either, I'll correct myself from now on." A few days later, he wrote another big-character poster:

	Thinking day and night,
	My own thoughts are too chaotic,
	Everyone's opinions are correct,
	I haven't changed after several educations,
	From now on, I'll make a big change.
	I'll challenge Jiaming,
	From now on, I'll no longer be a sluggard.
	Work hard in the commune this year,
	Guaranteeing a yield of a thousand catties per mu,
	Achieving ten thousand catties of grain per household.

	From then on, Old Zhao really became active. Before others started work, he would start first, and after others finished work, he would still be working. Recently, after the Provincial Party Committee inspection team visited the Pioneer Commune's big-character posters, they also wrote a passage in the comments.

	There is a Hu Jiaming in the Third Team,
	Criticizing her husband without mercy,
	Putting up a big-character poster,
	Causing her husband to get angry,
	Responding with a big-character poster,
	Not sincerely accepting opinions.
	The masses felt injustice,
	Supporting Hu Jiaming with a bulletin,
	The husband had no choice but to admit his mistake,
	Husband and wife reconcile and make a double leap forward.

　　夫妻和好双跃进
　　文焕
    湖北江陵荆北乡先锋社第三生产队有一对夫妻，男的叫赵金河，生产不大积极。女的叫胡家明，却是一个人人爱戴的生产小组长，胡家明对他丈夫的落后思想曾经进行过斗争，真是千言万语，可总是无效。别的社员起早睡晚搞跃进，赵金河呢，不是出外搞副业，就是在家闲着不出工。社内开展大鸣大放贴大字报时，胡家明就给他丈夫写了一张大字报贴在社的俱乐部里。
    老赵思想落了后，
    你在堤上把堤修，
    一切规划不知透，
    下堤天天来挖藕，
    提你意见不接受，
    古里古怪心事多。
    老赵看到大字报，回到家里对着胡家明就发脾气说：“有话不好当面讲，你为什么要丢我面子，出我大字报。”胡家明回答说：“我劝你不知几千回，你为什么不改正呢？”赵金河还是不服气，他说：“你会贴，我也会贴。”第二天，在俱乐部里又出现了一张新的大字报：
    去冬今春我上堤，
    你的意见一大堆，
    你今当了小组长，
    骄傲自满把我欺。
    工作完成下了堤，
    休息两天有啥关系？
    看了大字报就闷气，
    希望大家来评理！
    这张大字报贴出去后，全队就议论开了，有的说：“老赵就是落了后嘛，我们搞跃进，他搞促退，都要像他，今年规划怎能完成。”有的说：“他要叫我们大家评理，好吧，我们就给他评一评吧”，过了几天，评论报就发表了一篇评论。
    三队社员赵金河，
    古怪思想他最多，
    自己不搞大跃进，
    还把老婆腿来拖。
    不肯出工光挖藕，
    受了批评怪老婆，
    如今再不来改正，
    大字报上把你驳。
    老赵看了这张大字报，左思右想几天睡不着觉，他到他舅爷王三爹处跑一趟，对三爹诉苦说：
  “家明变了心，群众又支持她。”三爹听了，对金河说：“去年我经常坐茶馆不爱出工，是我不对，现在我转变了，谁知你现在还是一个懒汉，你若再不改变，明天我也来给你贴张大字报。”金河跑到东，跑到西，没有一个说他有理的。最后，他明白过来后悔了，就跟他妻子说：“我也不是一个没志气的人，我以后改正就是了。”过了几天，他就又写了一张大字报：
    日里想来夜里想，
    自己思想太混乱，
    大家意见提的对，
    几次教育我未改，
    从今以后大转变。
    我与家明来挑战，
    从今不再做懒汉。
    今年在社加油干，
    保证每亩产千斤，
    达到每户万斤粮。
    从此，老赵真的积极起来了，别人还未上工，他就先上工，别人收工了他还在干。最近省委检查团参观了先锋社的大字报后，在留言中，也写了一段话。
    三队有个胡家明，
    批评丈夫不留情，
    贴了一张大字报，
    惹得丈夫把气生，
    还了一张大字报，
    接受意见不虚心。
    群众见了抱不平，
    出报支持胡家明，
    丈夫只好来认错，
    夫妻和好双跃进。
