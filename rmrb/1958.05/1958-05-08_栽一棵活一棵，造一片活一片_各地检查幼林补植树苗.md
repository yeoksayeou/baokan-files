    Plant One and it Lives, Grow a Patch and it Thrives
    Various Localities Inspect Young Forests and Replenish Tree Seedlings
    (Our Newspaper) News: In the great leap forward spring, the national afforestation movement has seen rapid development. In order to realize the slogan "Plant one, and it lives; grow a patch, and it thrives," various localities are conducting post-afforestation inspections and evaluations. Provinces such as Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Gansu, Guizhou, and Guangdong have already organized inspection teams and mutual evaluation teams, going deep into villages and communes to begin inspecting the young forests of the spring afforestation work. Provinces with later afforestation seasons, such as Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Shandong, have already prepared for inspection and evaluation.
    According to reports from various localities, the area requiring processing, densification, replanting, and replenishment generally accounts for 1%-5% of the afforested area after inspection. Hebei's slogan in promoting inspection and evaluation is: "Launch a check-and-replenish movement, take responsibility to the end, guarantee planting, and guarantee survival!" Daming County also mobilized the entire county to universally water the trees planted "around the four sides" this spring. Baoding Prefecture launched a mutual inspection and a large-scale young forest inspection combined with agricultural production. Through inspection and evaluation, Qingyuan County has already selected three advanced townships and eight advanced communes. Botou City carried out the "three-level acceptance method" in the greening movement – accepting pit digging, tree planting, and watering, ensuring the quality of 80% of the young forests.
    Various localities are carrying out replanting, root-hugging, and soil-mounding movements in mutual inspection and comparison. While continuing to deepen inspection and evaluation, Anhui Province is replenishing wherever there are gaps, processing and densifying, replenishing seeds and seedlings, greatly improving the afforestation quality of forest land with potentially low survival rates. Liu'an Prefecture alone has replenished and mounded soil on more than 1.08 million mu. Wuhu Prefecture has already fostered more than 490,000 mu of forest trees.

    栽一棵活一棵，造一片活一片
    各地检查幼林补植树苗
    本报讯　大跃进的春天，全国造林运动有了飞快的发展。各地为了实现“栽一棵，活一棵，造一片活一片”的口号，正在进行造林后的检查评比。河北、河南、安徽、湖南、甘肃、贵州、广东等省已经组织检查组和相互评比组，深入乡、社开始春季造林工作的幼林检查。造林季节较迟的黑龙江、辽宁、山东等省，已经做好检查评比的准备。
    根据各地反映，检查后，需要加工、加密、补种、补植的，一般要占造林面积的1％—5％。河北在推动检查评比中提出的口号是：“开展查补运动，负责到底，保栽、保活！”大名县还发动全县人民，将今春在“四旁”植的树，普遍浇了一次水。保定专区开展了互查和结合农业生产的幼林大检查。清苑县通过检查、评比，已经评出三个先进乡、八个先进社。泊头市开展了绿化运动中的“三级验收法”验挖坑、验栽树、验浇水。保证了80％的幼林的质量。
    各地在互查互比中，开展补植、拥根、培土运动。安徽省在继续深入检查评比的同时，遇缺即补，加工、加密，补种子、补苗木，使成活率可能低的林地，大大提高了造林质量。仅六安专区就补植、培土一百零八万多亩。芜湖专区已扶育林木四十九万余亩。
