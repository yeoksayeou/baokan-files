    News from this newspaper: The State-owned Huadian Shale Oil Company has successfully experimented with and trial-produced the heap retorting method and a new type of square retorting furnace, greatly improving shale utilization and oil extraction rate. These two major technologies have opened up new avenues for increasing the production of synthetic petroleum.
    This year, the company will use this method on a large scale to retort small pieces of shale that were previously discarded. Shale utilization rate can be increased from the past 71% to 81% to 99.8%, with a planned increase in oil production of 12,000 tons for the whole year.
    The successful experiment of shale heap retorting method is of great significance for the development of local small-scale shale oil industry. Because using this method to retort shale to produce crude oil is relatively simple. It only requires building a rectangular enclosure with bricks, piling in shale, and igniting it. This process generates a gas, which is drawn out from the bottom of the shale pile through pipes and condensed into a liquid, which is crude oil. The production requires only a few equipment, such as exhaust fans, cooling towers, oil tanks, conveyors and some cast iron pipes. An investment of one million yuan can build such a small shale oil plant in three or four months.

    增产人造石油的捷径
    本报讯　国营桦甸页岩油公司试验和试制成堆干馏法、新式方形干馏炉成功，大大提高了页岩利用率和采油率；这两项重大技术开辟了增产人造石油的新途径。
    今年，这个公司大规模采用这种方法，干馏历来被扔掉的小块页岩，页岩利用率就可以由过去的71％到81％，提高到99.8％，全年计划增产石油一万二千吨。
    页岩成堆干馏法的试验成功，对于发展地方小型页岩油工业有着重要意义。因为使用这种办法干馏页岩生产原油，比较简便，只要用砖砌成长形围墙，堆入页岩，引火燃烧，产生出一种气体，这种气体从页岩堆底层用管吸出，凝成液体，就是原油。生产所需设备不多，只要有排风机、冷却塔、油罐、运输带和一些铸铁管等就够了。投资一百万元，三、四个月就能建成这样一座小型页岩油厂。
