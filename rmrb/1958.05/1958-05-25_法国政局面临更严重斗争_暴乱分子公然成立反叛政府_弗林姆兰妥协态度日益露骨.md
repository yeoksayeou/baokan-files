Xinhua News Agency, May 24th, Paris Dispatch: France's democratic republican system is under attack from fascist forces and right-wing reactionaries both internally and externally. Meanwhile, the Pflimlin government continues to seek compromise with right-wing forces and is striving to limit the power of democratic forces. Some political figures who are aware of the seriousness of the current political situation in France have begun to take certain joint actions, demanding the repulsion of the fascist threat.

An actual rebel government – the "Committee of Public Safety of Algeria and the Sahara" – was formally announced in Algiers on the 23rd. The riot leaders openly demanded the overthrow of the legitimate government in Paris and called for De Gaulle to take power.

In Paris, right-wing forces are intensifying pressure on the Pflimlin government to concede to De Gaulle. According to reports, De Gaulle, in a meeting with right-wing "Independent Party" leader Pinay on the 22nd, stated that he was only willing to "take full responsibility" himself and was unwilling to act as a "mediator" between the Pflimlin government and the Algerian rioters. De Gaulle openly expressed his hope to obtain at least a year and a half to two years of "full powers" to implement dictatorial rule. Sources say that the government intends to reach some kind of "understanding" with De Gaulle.

The Pflimlin government is also doing its utmost to immediately "revise" the constitution. At Pflimlin's request, the National Assembly decided on May 27th to discuss the government's proposal to immediately "revise" certain articles of the constitution. The cabinet also authorized Pflimlin to raise a vote of confidence during the debate, attempting to use the fastest possible procedure to force the parliament to pass a self-destructive decision that would stifle parliamentary power.

In the increasingly acute struggle between fascist and republican forces, significant disagreements have begun to emerge within the bourgeois "centrist" parties regarding the "revision" of the constitution and their attitude towards the current political situation. Pierre Mendès France, one of the leaders of the Radical Socialist Party, accused the government's "revision" of the constitution plan of paving the way for De Gaulle to take power. The right-wing "Independent Party," although in favor of depriving the people of their democratic rights, has not yet reached a consensus on whether it should support the Pflimlin government in doing so.

Within the Socialist Party, some members of parliament have already publicly criticized Pflimlin's approach to the De Gaulle threat in the corridors of the National Assembly.

Meanwhile, a group of "centrist" figures in the National Assembly, including former Prime Minister Daladier, announced on the 23rd the establishment of a "National Action and Defense of the Republic Committee." The committee issued a declaration stating that it "refuses to compromise with dictatorship."

In addition, the National Executive Bureau of the "Socialist Left League" also issued a communique on the 23rd, calling on workers to guard against the danger of adopting a policy of compromise with the separatist leaders of Algeria.

    法国政局面临更严重斗争
    暴乱分子公然成立反叛政府  弗林姆兰妥协态度日益露骨
    据新华社24日讯　巴黎消息：法国的共和民主制度正处在法西斯势力和右翼反动派里应外合的进攻下。同时，弗林姆兰政府在继续寻求同右翼势力妥协，并且竭力要求限制民主力量的权力。一部分意识到法国目前政局的严重性的政界人士已经开始采取某些联合行动，要求击退法西斯威胁。
    一个事实上的反叛政府——“阿尔及利亚和撒哈拉救国委员会”已经在23日正式在阿尔及尔宣布成立。暴乱头子们公开要求推翻巴黎的合法政府，让戴高乐上台。
    在巴黎，右翼势力在加紧向弗林姆兰政府施加压力，要它向戴高乐让步。据报道，戴高乐在22日同右翼“独立党”头子比内会谈时表示，他只愿意由他自己“负起全部责任”，不愿意在弗林姆兰政府和阿尔及利亚暴乱分子中间充当“斡旋人”。戴高乐公开表示希望至少得到一年半到两年的“全权”来实行独裁统治。有消息说，政府有意同戴高乐达到某种“谅解”。
    弗林姆兰政府还在全力谋求立即“修改”宪法。在弗林姆兰的要求下，国民议会决定在5月27日讨论政府提出的关于立即“修改”宪法某些条款的议案。内阁并且授权弗林姆兰在辩论时提出信任问题，企图用最快速的程序来强使议会通过扼杀议会权力的自杀性决定。
    在法西斯和共和力量越来越尖锐的斗争中，资产阶级“中间派”政党内部在“修改”宪法和对当前政局的态度上开始显露出相当严重的分歧。激进社会党领导人之一孟戴斯—弗朗斯指责政府的“修改”宪法方案是在替戴高乐上台铺平道路。右翼“独立党”虽然赞成剥夺人民的民主权利，但是对于是否应当支持由弗林姆兰政府来做这一点，到现在还没有一致意见。
    在社会党内部，一部分议员已经在国民议会走廊中公开指责弗林姆兰在对待戴高乐威胁的问题上的作法。
    同时，国民议会中包括前总理达拉第在内的一部分“中间”派人士在23日宣布成立了一个“民族行动和保卫共和国委员会”。这个委员会发表宣言，表示“拒绝同独裁妥协”。
    另外，“社会主义左翼联盟”全国执行局也在23日发表公报，号召劳动者提防采取同阿尔及利亚分裂首领妥协政策的危险。
