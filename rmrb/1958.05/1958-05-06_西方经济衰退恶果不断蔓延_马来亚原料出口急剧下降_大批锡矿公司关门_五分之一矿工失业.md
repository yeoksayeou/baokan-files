Xinhua News Agency, 5th dispatch from Kuala Lumpur: Affected by the economic recession in Western countries, Malaya's foreign trade in the first quarter of this year has significantly declined. According to official statistics published by Malaya, the total value of Malaya's import and export trade in the first quarter of this year was only 2,073,100,000 Malayan dollars, a decrease of 156,700,000 Malayan dollars compared with the same period last year. Among them, the total export value decreased by 100,890,000 Malayan dollars; the total import value decreased by 47,800,000 Malayan dollars. Due to the decline in export trade and other reasons, Malaya's foreign trade deficit in the first quarter of this year reached 138,900,000 Malayan dollars, an increase of 78.5% compared with the same period last year.
   Malaya has always relied mainly on the export of rubber and tin to maintain its national economy. Due to the economic recession in major capitalist countries, the reduced consumption of tin and the drop in tin prices, the International Tin Council took measures at the end of last year to reduce the output of tin-producing countries. This has resulted in Malaya's tin output in the first quarter of this year (including re-exports from other regions) being only 14,900 tons, a decrease of 20% compared with the same period last year. The International Tin Council has decided to further reduce the output of tin-producing countries in the second quarter. It is expected that Malaya will have to reduce its tin output by another 20% in the second quarter. Under these circumstances, 149 tin mining companies in Malaya have already closed down or suspended production in the first quarter. It is estimated that the number of unemployed miners has reached 6,400, accounting for 20% of the total number of miners in Malaya.

    西方经济衰退恶果不断蔓延
    马来亚原料出口急剧下降
    大批锡矿公司关门　五分之一矿工失业
    据新华社5日讯　吉隆坡消息：在西方国家经济衰退的影响下，马来亚今年第一季度的对外贸易显著下降。据马来亚官方发表的统计数字，马来亚今年第一季度进出口贸易总值只有马来亚币二十亿七千三百一十万元，比去年同期减少了一亿五千六百七十万元。其中出口总值减少了一亿零八百九十万元；进口总值减少了四千七百八十万元。由于出口贸易下降和其他原因，今年第一季度马来亚对外贸易入超额达一亿三千八百九十万元，比去年同期增加了78.5％。
    马来亚一向主要依靠输出橡胶和锡来维持国家经济。由于主要资本主义国家经济衰退，锡的消费量减少和锡价下跌，国际锡业理事会在去年年底采取了削减锡产国输出量的措施。这就使马来亚今年第一季度锡的输出（连同从其他地区运来再转口的在内）只有一万四千九百多吨，比去年同期减少了20％。国际锡业理事会决定在第二季度中进一步削减锡产国的输出量，预料马来亚在第二季度还要把锡输出量再减少20％。在这种情况下，马来亚在第一季度已经有一百四十九家锡矿公司倒闭或暂停生产，失业矿工估计已达六千四百人，占马来亚矿工总数的20％。
