    Don't Sell Unhealthy Photos
    Recently, many vendors selling movie actor photos have appeared on the market. Most of these photos were taken by the actors before liberation, some in strange costumes, and some even have yellow songs like "Sister I Love You" and "Four Seasons Beauty" printed on them.
    I think most of these photos are unhealthy, and they also represent the bourgeois practice of promoting stars from the old society. Today, an excellent actor makes a contribution to the cause of the Party, which is a great honor, and the broad masses also love them. Why sell their photos?　Guangxi Normal College　Wéi Yǔjí

    不要卖不健康的照片
    近来，市面上出现了很多卖电影演员照片的商贩。这些照片大多是演员们在解放前拍摄的，有的还是奇装怪服，有些照片下面还印制上“妹妹我爱你”、“四季美人”等黄色歌曲。
    我觉得这些照片多数是不健康的，还有旧社会那种为明星捧场的资产阶级做法。在今天，一个优秀的演员，对党的事业是有贡献，是莫大的光荣，广大群众也热爱他们，何必为他们卖照片呢？　广西师范学院　韦雨集
