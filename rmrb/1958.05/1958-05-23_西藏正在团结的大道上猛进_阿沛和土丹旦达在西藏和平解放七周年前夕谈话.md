(Our newspaper's dispatch from Lhasa on May 22nd) Reporter Zong Zidu reports: On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the reporter interviewed two representatives of the Tibetan local government who participated in the negotiations for the peaceful liberation of Tibet.

The then chief representative of the Tibetan local talks, Apei Awang Jinmei, received the reporter in his office. He is currently the Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. The office was decorated with a row of Tibetan-style cushions according to the Tibetan lifestyle. Apei Awang Jinmei was sitting cross-legged on one of them, handling official business.

Apei Awang Jinmei happily recalled the process of the peaceful liberation of Tibet negotiations. He said that through the negotiations, he personally experienced the greatness and correctness of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government's ethnic policies, as well as their care for the Tibetan people. He said: "The agreement on measures for the peaceful liberation of Tibet stipulates that the Tibetan people have the right to exercise national regional autonomy. Over the past seven years, the Central Government has not only fully granted the Tibetan people the right to autonomy, but also meticulously helped us learn to exercise that right to autonomy."

Apei Awang Jinmei continued: "Over the past seven years, the Central Government has helped the Tibetan people a great deal, building highways, factories, schools, hospitals, and agricultural experimental farms, etc. These are all built on Tibetan land and are visible to everyone. The backward old face of Tibet has changed. Under the Central Government's patient guidance, Tibet has also united internally. On this basis, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. The vast majority of the staff of the Preparatory Committee are Tibetan cadres."

Apei Awang Jinmei's conversation was frequently interrupted by Tibetan cadres from the Preparatory Committee's General Office who came to ask for instructions or submit documents for review. Most of these documents were in Tibetan, but some Tibetan documents had Chinese translations attached. He temporarily put aside the documents that did not require immediate processing and continued: "Now, the main task is to strengthen propaganda work, so that all Tibetan monks and laypeople understand the nature and role of the Preparatory Committee. We must also vigorously train cadres, improve work efficiency, and strengthen internal unity, in order to create conditions for the early formal establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region."

The reporter asked him whether the work of the Preparatory Committee was also preparing for a leap forward, given that the mainland was undergoing a great leap forward in socialist construction. After the translator translated this question, Apei Awang Jinmei became even more excited. He said, "Of course we must leap forward, but due to the limitations of social conditions in Tibet, it is currently impossible to have a vigorous leap forward in all aspects like the mainland. However, we can completely achieve a leap forward in political thought, in our current work, in national unity, and in internal Tibetan unity."

On the same afternoon, the reporter came to an old residence in the north of Lhasa city. A lama in his fifties greeted the reporter with a cordial handshake. This lama had signed his name on the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" seven years ago: Tubdan Danda. Tubdan Danda is currently the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. He is also the Secretary-General of the Tibetan local government. He works in the Preparatory Committee on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and handles the work of the Tibetan local government and conducts religious activities on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

As soon as he sat down, Tubdan Danda said: "Participating in the negotiations for the peaceful liberation of Tibet is the most glorious thing in my life, because the happiness that the peaceful liberation of Tibet has brought to the Tibetan people is immeasurable. I am responsible for managing cadre work in the Preparatory Committee. Take the training of ethnic minority cadres, for example!" As he spoke, he took out a notebook and calculated while taking a string of prayer beads from around his neck, saying: "Over the past seven years, the Central Government has trained four to five thousand Tibetan cadres and trainees for the Tibetan local government, including administrative, financial, postal and telecommunications, public security, health, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, and various production technical personnel."

Tubdan Danda said: "In the past few years, Tibetan cadres did not understand the new work system and methods. Han cadres were always very patient in providing guidance and assistance in business and ideology. Now, many Tibetan cadres are already competent for general work positions."

Then, Tubdan Danda spoke with excitement and joy about the unity between Tibetan and Han cadres. He said: "Everyone is united very well, without the division of ethnic boundaries. Han cadres help Tibetan cadres learn; Tibetan cadres also introduce the situation in Tibet that they are familiar with to Han cadres without reservation."

When the reporter bid farewell, Tubdan Danda said at the door: "The agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet was signed by me personally, and I will definitely do my best to strive for its thorough and complete implementation." (Attached pictures)

    西藏正在团结的大道上猛进
    阿沛和土丹旦达在西藏和平解放七周年前夕谈话
    本报拉萨22日电　记者宗子度报道：在和平解放西藏七周年的前夕，记者访问了曾参加和平解放西藏谈判的西藏地方的两位代表。
    当时的西藏地方和谈首席代表阿沛·阿旺晋美在他的办公室里接见了记者。他现在是西藏自治区筹备委员会秘书长。办公室里按照西藏藏族的生活习惯陈列着一排藏式坐垫。阿沛·阿旺晋美正盘腿坐在上边处理公务。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美愉快地回述了和平解放西藏谈判的经过。他说，通过那次谈判，更加使他亲身体会到党中央和中央人民政府民族政策的伟大和正确以及对于西藏人民的关怀。他说：“和平解放西藏办法的协议中规定了西藏人民有实行民族区域自治的权利。七年来，中央不但完全给予了西藏人民自治权利，而且还无微不至地帮助我们去学会运用自治权利。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美接着说：“七年来，中央帮助西藏人民是很大的，修建了公路、工厂、学校、医院和农业试验场等，这些都是在西藏的土地上建设起来，每个人都可以看得见的。西藏落后的旧面貌改变了。在中央循循善诱的教导下，西藏内部也团结起来了。在此基础上，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会。筹委会的工作人员绝大多数都是藏族干部。”
    阿沛·阿旺晋美的谈话，时时被筹委会办公厅的藏族干部来请示工作或送阅文件所打断。这些文件大多数是藏文的，但也有些藏文文件的后面附有汉文。他把不需急待处理的文件暂时搁了下来，继续说：“现在，主要的任务是加强宣传工作，让所有的西藏僧俗人民都了解筹委会的性质和作用。并大力培养干部，提高工作效率，加强内部团结，为争取早日正式成立西藏自治区创造条件。”
    记者问他，内地正在进行社会主义建设大跃进，筹委会的工作是不是也准备跃进？当翻译同志译完这句问话后，阿沛·阿旺晋美就更兴奋起来。他说，“当然要跃进，不过，西藏由于社会条件的限制，目前还不可能像内地一样在各方面都轰轰烈烈地大跃进，但我们完全可以在政治思想上、在现职工作上、在民族团结和西藏内部团结上来一个跃进。”
    同一天下午，记者来到拉萨市北城一幢古老的住宅里。一位五十多岁的喇嘛迎着记者亲切握手。这位喇嘛七年前曾在“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”上签下了他的名字：土丹旦达。土丹旦达现任西藏自治区筹备委员会民政处处长。他还是西藏地方政府的秘书长。每星期二、四、六到筹委会办公，一、三、五处理西藏地方政府的工作和进行宗教活动。
    一坐下来，土丹旦达就说：“参加和平解放西藏的谈判是我一生中最光荣的事情，因为西藏和平解放给西藏人民带来的幸福是不可估量的。我是在筹委会负责管理干部工作的。就拿培养民族干部来说吧！”说到这里，他拿出了一本记事册，一面还从颈项上解下一串念珠计算着说：“七年来，中央已经给西藏地方培养了四、五千名藏族干部和学员，包括行政、财经、邮电、公安、卫生、畜牧兽医和各种生产技术人材。”
    土丹旦达说：“前几年，藏族干部都不懂得新的工作制度和工作方法，汉族干部总是非常耐心地在业务上、在思想上进行辅导帮助。现在，很多藏族干部已经能胜任一般工作职务了。”
    接着，土丹旦达又怀着兴奋和愉快的心情谈起了藏、汉族干部间的团结情况。他说：“彼此都团结得很好，没有民族界线的划分。汉族干部帮助藏族干部学习；藏族干部也把自己所熟悉的西藏情况毫无保留地介绍给汉族干部。”
    记者告辞的时候，土丹旦达送到门口时说：“和平解放西藏的协议是我亲手参与签订的，我一定尽最大的努力争取彻底全部实现。”（附图片）
