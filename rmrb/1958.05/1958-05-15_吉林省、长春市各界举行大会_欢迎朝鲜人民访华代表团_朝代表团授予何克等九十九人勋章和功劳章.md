Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th - A grand meeting was held this afternoon in the Workers' Cultural Palace by 1,500 people from all walks of life in Jilin Province and Changchun City to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China.

The Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by delegation leader Xu Zhenshu and deputy delegation leader Jin Tianhai, as well as Vice Minister of Internal Affairs Wang Yifu, Vice Governors of Jilin Province Xu Shouxuan and Wang Huanru, Deputy Secretary-General of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China Zhao Tianye, Deputy Commander of the Jilin Military Region Zhong Mingbiao, and Vice Mayor of Changchun City Li Chengkun, attended the meeting.

Xu Shouxuan, Vice Governor of Jilin Province, delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting, saying that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people, forged with blood in the struggle, is like the Yalu River, flowing endlessly. In particular, the people of Jilin Province are separated from the Korean people only by a river, living as neighbors, sharing weal and woe. This close friendship between the Chinese and Korean people cannot be intimidated by any aggressive forces.

Xu Shouxuan said: In October 1952, Jilin Province received nearly 10,000 Korean children who had been orphaned in the American war of aggression against Korea. Over the years, these children have lived and studied well and have grown up rapidly. The people of Jilin Province regard helping the Korean people to raise war orphans as an internationalist duty and are proud of it.

The speech of delegation leader Xu Zhenshu was warmly welcomed by the audience. She said: The delegation felt infinitely joyful and excited to have the opportunity to visit Jilin Province, a place full of revolutionary historical sites of the Chinese and Korean people. Xu Zhenshu said: The people of Jilin Province have nurtured the children of martyrs and war orphans of the Korean people as if they were their own children, and have enabled them to learn advanced science and technology and become a reliable force for building a socialist motherland in the future. This is a living example of proletarian internationalism. Xu Zhenshu finally expressed that the Korean people would strengthen their unity with the people of all socialist countries and continue to develop the traditional friendship between the Korean and Chinese people.

After Xu Zhenshu's speech, she presented a banner to the Jilin Provincial People's Committee. After the meeting, the distinguished guests enjoyed cultural performances.

In the morning, the distinguished guests laid wreaths at the Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery in the suburbs of Changchun City. In the evening, the distinguished guests attended a banquet held by Xu Shouxuan, Vice Governor of Jilin Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 14th - The Korean People's Delegation to China held a medal awarding ceremony in Changchun City today. Delegation leader Xu Zhenshu awarded the Second and Third Class National Flag Medals and Orders of Merit to 99 people, including He Ke, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jilin Province.

    新华社长春14日电　吉林省和长春市各界人民一千五百多人今天下午在工人文化宫举行大会，欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团。

    徐寿轩说：1952年10月，吉林省接待了将近一万名在美国侵朝战争中变成孤儿的朝鲜小朋友。几年来，这些孩子们的生活、学习都很好，并且已经很快成长起来。吉林省人民把帮助朝鲜人民抚养战灾孤儿，看作是一项国际主义的义务，并且为此感到光荣。

    许贞琡讲话后，向吉林省人民委员会赠送锦旗一面。会后贵宾们欣赏了文娱节目。
    上午，贵宾们曾到长春市市郊革命烈士陵园献花圈。晚上，贵宾们出席了吉林省副省长徐寿轩举行的宴会。
