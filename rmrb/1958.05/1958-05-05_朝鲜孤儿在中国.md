Korean Orphans in China

Under the warm care of the Chinese government and people, 15,620 Korean war orphans living in various parts of Northeast China are leading happy learning lives.

Since October 1952, Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces have received over 22,000 Korean war orphans in succession, settling them in 47 primary schools and nurseries in 36 counties and cities. In recent years, about 7,000 Korean children who grew up in China have returned to their homeland to participate in economic construction.

After properly settling the Korean war orphans, various regions not only ensured material supplies and vigorously strengthened the children's nutrition, but also provided effective treatment. As a result, the morbidity rate of Korean children, who were devastated by the US imperialist war of aggression, rapidly declined year by year. During health check-ups in 1953, the children's weight increased by an average of more than five kilograms. In order to effectively treat the war orphans' paragonimiasis, three specialized paragonimiasis schools and sanatoriums were established in Gaiping, Liaoning Province, and Gongzhuling, Jilin Province, in 1955. Equipped with modern medical equipment and staffed with medical personnel with relatively high technical skills, the children's health was quickly restored after treatment, and diseases such as paragonimiasis, which are highly harmful, were eradicated.

Under the leadership of the Korean Children's Education Office in China, the children study according to the Korean school system and curriculum. In order to assist in the vocational education of Korean war orphans, local leading organs actively helped various colleges solve specific problems in internships. Many industrial and agricultural production units undertook the task of assisting them in internships. More than 1,590 students entered factories, interning in more than 40 types of work in metallurgical, machinery, railway, chemical, textile, and other industrial systems, generally reaching the technical level of the third or fourth grade in Korea. More than 5,600 students learned certain knowledge and skills in agriculture and animal husbandry.

Over the years, Korean children and Korean faculty and staff have formed a deep friendship with the local people. Whenever there are major festivals in Korea and China, local governments and the masses visit the Korean children, and Chinese and Korean children celebrate together in joint festivities, which has become a habit over the years. Teachers and students in Chinese and Korean schools in various parts of the three northeastern provinces have become close friends through mutual learning over the years.

In addition to frequently thanking the local government and factories for their care, the Korean war orphans living in various places also go to the countryside during the busy farming season to help nearby agricultural cooperatives with rice planting and weeding. Students from Tieling Junior Technical College in Liaoning Province and Shuangcheng County Primary School in Heilongjiang Province planted China-Korea Friendship Forests with Chinese students in their respective localities to commemorate the deep friendship between the people of China and Korea. In April of this year, Korean female students from Tieling Junior Technical College also worked with Chinese women to build a China-Korea Women's Friendship Reservoir in just three days. These activities have further enhanced the friendship and unity between the people of China and Korea.

    朝鲜孤儿在中国
    生活在东北各地的一万五千六百二十名朝鲜战灾儿童，在中国政府和人民的热情关怀下，正过着幸福的学习生活。
    从1952年10月开始，辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省前后接收了两万二千多名朝鲜战灾儿童，安置在三十六个县、市的四十七处初等学院和爱育园中，最近几年已有在中国长大的朝鲜儿童七千人左右回到了他们的祖国，参加了经济建设。
    各地对朝鲜战灾儿童妥善安置以后，除保证物质供应、大力加强儿童的营养外，并且给予了有效的治疗，使由于受到美帝国主义侵略战争摧残的朝鲜儿童，患病率逐年迅速下降，在1953年进行健康检查时，儿童们的体重平均增加了五公斤以上。为了有效地治疗战灾儿童的肺吸虫病，1955年在辽宁省盖平、吉林省公主岭等地成立了三所专治肺吸虫病学院及疗养院，装备了现代化的医疗设备，配备了技术水平比较高的医务人员，经过治疗后，很快地恢复了儿童的健康，并且根除了肺吸虫等为害较大的疾病。
    在设在我国的朝鲜儿童教育处领导下，孩子们按照朝鲜的学制和课程内容进行学习。为了协助对于朝鲜战灾儿童进行职业教育工作，各地领导机关都积极地帮助各个学院解决了实习中的具体问题，许多工农业生产单位承担了协助他们进行实习的任务，有一千五百九十多名学生进了工厂，分别在冶金、机械、铁道、化学、纺织等工业系统的生产单位里实习四十多个工种，一般可达到朝鲜三、四级的技术水平；有五千六百多名学生学会了一定的农业、饲养业的知识和技能。
    几年来，朝鲜孩子和朝鲜教职员工们，已经和当地人民结成了深厚的友谊。每逢朝鲜和我国的重大节日，各地政府、人民群众对朝鲜儿童进行慰问，中朝儿童们相互联欢庆祝，几年来已成习惯。东北三省各地中、小学校的教师和学生同朝鲜的教师和学生，通过互相学习，几年来已成为亲密的朋友。
    住在各地的朝鲜战灾儿童除经常对当地政府和工厂感谢对他们的关怀外，并在农忙季节下乡帮助附近农业社插秧和锄草。辽宁省铁岭初级技术学院、黑龙江省双城县初等学院的学生，为了纪念中朝两国人民之间的深厚友谊，分别在当地和中国学生一起种植了中朝友谊林，铁岭初级技术学院朝鲜女学生今年4月又同中国妇女一起仅用三天时间修成了一座中朝妇女友谊水库。这些活动进一步增进了中朝两国人民的友谊和团结。

    各地的党和政府的负责同志们常常去看望住在我国的朝鲜儿童们。中共辽西省北镇县委书记车秉正和县长方焕章去看望住在该县的朝鲜儿童时，天真活泼的孩子们都跑出来迎接他们。王永熙1953年  摄
    孩子们热爱中国人民志愿军。他们时常去慰问在当地休养的志愿军休养员。
