Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 13th May: The Burmese Foreign Ministry issued a press release on the evening of May 13th calling on all countries to make every effort to prevent interference in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The press release stated that the Union of Burma is deeply concerned by the increasing evidence that foreign adventurers are interfering in the situation in Indonesia. The press release emphasized that in the current situation in Indonesia, the best approach is to let the Indonesian people solve their own problems.

This press release is the first official statement made by the Burmese government on the issue of foreign interference in Indonesian affairs since the outbreak of the rebellion in Indonesia.

Xinhua News Agency, 14th May: Singapore dispatch: The Ambassador of the United Arab Republic to Indonesia, Anrosi, condemned the act of foreign interference in the Indonesian situation in Singapore on May 13th. He said that if there were no foreign interference, the current domestic problems in Indonesia would be easily solved.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 14th May: "Democratic Korea" published a commentary today condemning the United States for using the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Philippines to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.

The commentary said that the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the Philippines recently sent so-called "volunteer troops" composed of regular troops to North Sulawesi, Indonesia, to support Indonesian rebels. This is a desperate attempt by the US imperialists to prolong the lives of Indonesian rebels, and another blatant act of provocation by the US imperialists, who will not give up their policy of aggression against Indonesia, against Southeast Asia and world peace.

    新华社仰光13日电　缅甸外交部5月13日晚上发表的新闻公报呼吁所有国家竭力设法阻止干预印度尼西亚的内政。
    公报说，越来越多的证据说明，外国冒险分子干预了印度尼西亚的局势，缅甸联邦对此深感关切。公报强调指出，在印度尼西亚当前的局势中，最好的方针就是让印度尼西亚人民解决他们自己的问题。
    这个新闻公报是缅甸政府在印度尼西亚发生叛乱事件以来，就外国干涉印度尼西亚事务所发表的第一个正式声明。
    据新华社14日讯　新加坡消息：阿拉伯联合共和国驻印度尼西亚大使安罗西5月13日在新加坡谴责外国干涉印度尼西亚局势的行为。他说假如没有外来的干涉，印度尼西亚目前国内的问题会很容易解决的。
    新华社平壤14日电　“民主朝鲜报”今天发表评论，谴责美国利用蒋介石集团和菲律宾干涉印度尼西亚内政。
    评论说，蒋介石集团和菲律宾最近把由正规军组成的所谓“志愿军”派往印度尼西亚北苏拉威西，去支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子，这是美帝国主义者设法使印度尼西亚叛乱分子苟延残喘的一种不择手段的勾当，是死不放弃侵略印度尼西亚政策的美帝国主义者对东南亚和世界和平的又一个露骨的挑衅行为。
