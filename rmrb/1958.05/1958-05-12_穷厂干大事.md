　　Poor Factory Does Great Things
　　In early April this year, the Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory sent a type of fertilizer – antibiotic fertilizer – to more than 30 agricultural science research institutions and large farms in various provinces and cities across the country, asking them to conduct experiments in various regions. This is a new product that the factory produced for farmers this year, which is both cheap and highly effective, and it is the first of its kind in the country.
　　The Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory is located in two remote small alleys in the northwest corner of Beijing. The factory buildings are all converted from civilian houses, and the entire factory has only more than 200 employees.
　　In September last year, an article about antibiotic fertilizer in a science magazine aroused the factory's motivation to trial-produce this fertilizer. Because this fertilizer is simple to use, it is both a fertilizer and a disease-preventing agent, and it can also promote early maturity of crops, and the price is cheap, only 36 cents per mu. The factory did not have any technicians who understood this knowledge. In order to quickly trial-produce this product, it sent two technicians to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences to learn the basic knowledge about antibiotics. Trial production began at the beginning of this year.
　　The factory did not have a building, so they borrowed two rooms outside and pasted them with paper. This was their laboratory. Many of the equipment were either borrowed or replaced by local methods. A stove was used instead of heating, manual crushing was used instead of a raw material pulverizer, and a roll of hemp paper was used instead of a funnel. The factory only had two microscopes and three sterilizers. Because the production task was urgent, they could not be used for testing at all. The technicians took advantage of Sundays or gaps after work to use microscopes and sterilizers for testing.
　　Material difficulties were overcome one by one. The most difficult thing was that many technical problems could not be solved. The young technicians, Li Ersheng and Yu Guizhi, who were in charge of this work, often stayed up late, reading books and studying with everyone in the small laboratory, or repeatedly consulting professors at Beijing Agricultural University with their own problems. Once, it was already past one o'clock in the night, and the lights were still on in the small laboratory. Li Ersheng paced back and forth in the room, constantly murmuring "bacterial seedlings, bacterial seedlings..." In front of Professor Yin Xinyun of Beijing Agricultural University, he was like a first-grade elementary school student, taking notes non-stop of every word the professor said. He and the professor had a common wish: to catch up with time and successfully trial-produce it before this year's spring planting.
　　It was finally successfully trial-produced in early April, and mass production began immediately. The factory vacated two rooms from other departments to serve as workshops for producing antibiotic fertilizer. If there were not enough tables, they used chairs as tables, and a small stool in front of the chair, working in a simple and crude way. A corridor of only two square meters became a workshop for mixing raw materials. In these two small houses, 500 kilograms of antibiotic fertilizer can be produced every day.
　　Now, people from various provinces and cities across the country are coming to this small factory to visit and learn one after another, and order forms are pouring in from Hainan Island, Inner Mongolia, Northeast, Northwest and other places.

　　穷厂干大事
    今年4月初，北京细菌肥料厂向全国各省市的三十多个农业科学研究机关和大型农场发出了一种肥料——抗生菌肥料，请他们在各地作实验。这是这个工厂今年为农民生产的一种既便宜、效能又大的新产品，在全国是首创。
    北京市细菌肥料厂设立在北京城西北角两条偏僻的小胡同里，厂房都是由民房改建而成，全厂只二百多职工。
    去年9月间，一本科学杂志上一篇有关抗生菌肥料的文章，引起了这个工厂试制这种肥料的动机。因为这种肥料使用简单，既是肥料又是防病害的药剂，还能促使作物早熟，价钱也便宜，一亩地只用三角六分钱。这个工厂根本没有懂得这方面知识的技术人员，为了很快能试制这种产品，就派了两个技术员去中国医学科学院学习有关抗生菌的基本知识。今年年初试制就开始了。
    工厂没有房子，他们在外边借了两间屋子，用纸糊了糊，这就是他们的试验室。很多设备不是借用，就是自己用土办法来代替。用火炉代替暖气，用手工粉碎代替原料粉碎机，把麻纸一卷就代替漏斗。这个工厂只有两架显微镜，三个灭菌锅，因生产任务紧迫，根本不能抽出来作试验用，技术人员们乘星期天或晚上下班后的空隙，利用显微镜和灭菌锅作试验。
    物质上的困难一个个地克服了，最难的是很多技术上的问题解决不了。负责这个工作的青年技术员李尔绳、于桂芝常常深夜不眠，在小试验室里和大家一起看书、研究，或者带着自己的难题一次又一次地去请教北京农业大学的教授。有一次已经夜里一点多钟了，小试验室里还亮着灯光，李尔绳一个人在屋子里踱来踱去，不断低语着“菌苗、菌苗……”。在北京农业大学教授尹莘耘面前，他像一个一年级小学生，笔不停毫地记着教授说的每一句话。他和教授有一个共同的心愿：一定要赶在时间前面，在今年春播前试制成功。
    4月初终于试制成功了，当即开始大批生产。工厂从别的部门腾出两间房子，作为生产抗生菌肥料的车间，桌子不够用，他们就把椅子当桌子，椅子前放个小凳子便因陋就简地工作起来。只有两平方多公尺的走廊，变成了搅拌原料的车间。就在这两间小屋子里，每天能生产五百公斤抗生菌肥料。
    现在，全国各省市到这个小工厂来参观学习的人络绎不绝，订货单从海南岛、内蒙古、东北、西北等地源源而来。
