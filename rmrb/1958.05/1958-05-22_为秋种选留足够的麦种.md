Select and Reserve Enough Wheat Seeds for Autumn Planting

The harvest season for winter wheat in the major producing areas is fast approaching. Making full preparations to select and reserve the wheat seeds needed for autumn planting this year is an important task before the wheat harvest. Last year, some areas expanded their wheat acreage and temporarily supplemented it with a lot of wheat seeds. The vast majority of these seeds were selected from commercial grain, and the varieties were impure. If we do not carefully select and reserve seeds during this year's wheat harvest, the degree of mixing will continue, which will be detrimental to increasing wheat production next year.

According to the spirit of this year's National Seed Work Conference, the work of breeding improved varieties in the future should be mainly based on self-propagation, self-selection, self-reservation, and self-use by agricultural cooperatives. The state will only systematically breed and supply some new and high-quality varieties and seeds for agricultural cooperatives to use for seed land replacement. Therefore, the seed selection and reservation work of agricultural cooperatives this year is more arduous than in previous years.

Some agricultural cooperatives have already established wheat seed plots. These cooperatives must first strengthen the management of seed plots, thoroughly prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and promptly remove non-variety hybrid plants and inferior plants eroded by diseases and insect pests. The best seeds selected by the ear in the seed plot can be used in the seed plot for autumn sowing this year. Regardless of the general seeds or ear-selected seeds harvested in the seed plot, special personnel should be designated to be responsible for single cutting, single drying, and single storage. If the number of seeds reserved in the seed plot cannot meet the needs of autumn sowing, the remaining part can be selected and reserved in the large fields. Agricultural cooperatives that did not establish seed plots last year should select wheat fields with uniform plant growth and relatively few hybrid and inferior plants in general fields as seed selection and reservation plots for this year as soon as possible. Field management should also be strengthened for such plots, especially the removal of hybrid and inferior plants.

In order to ensure the quality of the selected and reserved seeds, each agricultural cooperative should not only designate members with seed selection experience to be responsible for seed selection work, but also consider providing reasonable technical remuneration. The extra work points spent on seed selection and reservation and the reduction in output due to weeding out inferior plants should be borne by the cooperative. The storage of seeds is also a very important matter, and a certain storage system needs to be established.

This year, some areas have experienced wheat diseases of varying degrees, which has greatly affected wheat seed selection and reservation work. In areas where wheat diseases are found, on the one hand, wheat fields with no or mild diseases should be selected as early as possible for strict seed selection and reservation; on the other hand, attention should be paid to discovering disease-resistant varieties in the occurrence of wheat diseases, and more of these new varieties should be selected and reserved as much as possible.

In addition to reserving the necessary seeds, agricultural cooperatives in some southern regions have also stored a certain number of backup seeds. This practice is worth promoting.

### 为秋种选留足够的麦种

    为秋种选留足够的麦种
    主要产区的冬小麦的收割季节，很快就要到来了。充分做好准备，选留今年秋种需要的麦种，是麦收以前的一项重要工作。去年一些地区由于扩大麦田面积，临时补充不少麦种。这些调剂的麦种，绝大部分是从商品粮内选出来的，品种不纯。如果在今年麦收的时候不认真选种留种，混杂程度就会继续下去，这对明年小麦增产是不利的。
    根据今年全国种子工作会议的精神，今后繁殖良种工作要以农业社自繁、自选、自留、自用为主，国家只作有计划地繁殖和供应一部分新的优良品种和高质量的种子，给农业社种子地换种之用。因此农业社今年的选种留种工作，比往年更加繁重了。
    有些农业社已建立了小麦留种地，这样的社首先要加强种子地的管理工作，彻底防除病虫害，并及时拔除非本品种的杂株和受病虫害侵蚀的劣株。在种子地里穗选的最好种子，可以用在今年秋播种子地里。不论种子地里收下的一般种子或穗选的种子，都要指定专人负责单割单晒、单储存。如果种子地留种数量不能满足今秋播种需要，不足的部分，可以在大田里选留。去年没有建立种子地的农业社，应当及早在一般大田里选择麦株生长整齐，杂株、劣株比较少的麦田作为今年选留种子的地块。对这样的地块也要加强田间管理，特别是拔除杂劣植株。
    为了保证选留种子的质量，每个农业社不但要指定有选种经验的社员专任选种工作，而且要考虑给以合理的技术报酬。由于选种留种多支出的工分和由于去杂去劣而减少的产量，应由社里统一负担。种子的保管也是一件很重要的事，需要建立一定的保管制度。
    今年一些地区发生轻重不同的小麦病害，这对小麦的选种留种工作影响很大。发现小麦病害的地区，一方面要及早选择无病的或病轻的麦田，进行严格的选种留种；另一方面要在麦病发生中注意发现抗病的品种，对这种新的品种应尽量多选多留。
    南方一些地区的农业社，除了留足必需的种子以外，还储备了一定数量的后备种子。这种作法是值得提倡的。
