    Surrendering to the Truth
    Professor of Chemistry Department, Peking University Fu Ying
    Before the double-anti movement, because I stood on the bourgeois standpoint, I had serious misconceptions about many things, the most prominent of which were my views on ideological remolding and the leadership of the Party.
    Regarding Ideological Remolding
    I gained a lot during the Three-Anti Movement. At that time, I had pro-American and fear-of-America thoughts. After the Three-Anti Movement, these thoughts were thoroughly defeated, and I distinguished between the enemy and ourselves. Later, I was honored to participate in the delegation to North Korea to慰问 the troops, and I saw and heard countless heroic deeds of the volunteers in Korea, which deeply moved me, and I stood more firmly on the position of distinguishing between the enemy and ourselves. However, because I was born into a feudal family and received a bourgeois education for a long time, many bourgeois thoughts were deeply rooted in my heart. The focus of the Three-Anti Movement was to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, so the criticism of general bourgeois thoughts was not thorough enough, and I felt that the attitude during the criticism was somewhat rough, so it failed to defeat them. In addition, I had baggage such as patriotism, a clean historical record, and being an upright person. I believed that I had already made up my mind to follow the Communist Party and that there was no problem with my political stance, so my political requirements were extremely low. I was also a person with purely technical viewpoints, believing that serving the people meant simply imparting chemical knowledge to students, so I did not care about political study. Over time, bourgeois thoughts not only did not decrease compared to the end of the Three-Anti Movement, but instead gained the upper hand, causing me to cling to old ideas and treat old goods as treasures, thinking that I had no undesirable thoughts. Wanting to sweep away these old goods would cause resentment, so I made no progress in my thinking for five years.
    After the start of the double-anti movement, I saw the exhibition of substandard products by graduates of the Chemistry Department of Peking University, which shocked me, because many of those students had been taught by me and could not have been unaffected by me. From that time on, I began to doubt whether my thinking was desirable. Later, after listening to Comrade Peng Zhen's report, he said that bourgeois intellectuals were educated in bourgeois schools from childhood to adulthood, so how could they have socialist thoughts. Now that we are moving towards socialism, we must discard old ideas (roughly). This sentence awakened me. Then I read many of the students' big-character posters and realized how much harm I had caused them. This discovery made me very sad, because I was corrupting their pure minds. From the big-character posters and conversations of the young lecturers, I learned that many young teachers were taking me as a banner and marching towards becoming white specialists. At this point, I fully realized the harmfulness of my existence among the youth at Peking University. I hated myself, asking myself why such a great evil consequence had occurred. After the continuous help of comrades and the fierce struggle of my own thinking, I finally realized that this was the inevitable result of teaching from a bourgeois standpoint. I also realized that to truly solve the problem, the only way is to completely change my standpoint. Now, looking back at the reasons for evading ideological remolding in the past, none of them hold water. I call myself a patriotic person, but my understanding of the word "patriotism" is very empty, just a kind of national sentiment caused by being oppressed by foreign races for a long time. Before liberation, this kind of sentiment still had its positive effect, but today, when the motherland has moved towards socialism, and my patriotism is still stuck at the stage of narrow national standpoints, that is not enough. Today, a truly patriotic person must first love the Communist Party and follow the Party's socialist road wholeheartedly; to take the socialist road, one must thoroughly eliminate the bourgeois thoughts that conflict with socialism; to eliminate this kind of thought, one must accept ideological remolding. But I evaded remolding. Can this be considered patriotism? Obviously not. I am also a person who considers himself upright. Uprightness means having the courage to fight against evil forces and also having the courage to correct mistakes. In the Kuomintang era, I did not dare to criticize. When it became unbearable, I fled to the United States and burrowed into the ivory tower. Today, when the Communist Party is leading 600 million people towards the light, I use uprightness as an excuse to ignore ideological remolding. Is this having the courage to correct mistakes? This kind of "courage" is not uprightness but distortion. I thought I was following the Party and that there was no problem with my political stance. If I were really following, of course there would be no problem with my stance, but the Party takes the will of 600 million people as its will and takes the socialist road, while I follow my own will and take the bourgeois road. Going in opposite directions, how can it be said that I am following the Party? More accurately, I am going against the Party. I believe that I serve the people by imparting chemistry, and that studying or not studying politics is irrelevant. Chemistry certainly has no class nature, but the person who masters chemistry cannot be without class nature. For an individualist, chemistry only serves him or a few people; for a socialist, chemistry belongs to 600 million people. I use individualism as my guiding ideology to teach students, which is dragging them back. How can this be considered serving the people? Just such a preliminary analysis shows that all the reasons for not needing ideological remolding have gone bankrupt. It can be seen that the real reason why I am unwilling to accept ideological remolding is simply that I am reluctant to discard the already rotten bourgeois thoughts. The reasons I initially held were just finding reasons to deceive myself in the absence of reasons, and over time, I came to believe them.
    Regarding the Leadership of the Party
    In 1953, I went to the Petroleum Institute. At that time, the school had just been established, and the equipment was naturally very poor. I wanted to start chemical research, but there were not enough instruments, medicines, or laboratories. At that time, I did not carefully consider how many more important things a newly established school needed to do than research, so I thought that the leaders of the institute did not support me; the reason why they did not support me was because they did not understand chemistry. I am an arrogant and conceited person with a purely technical viewpoint, believing that in cultural and educational undertakings, outsiders can lead in terms of policies and guidelines, but for the specific leadership of science and technology, it must be insiders. The experience at the Petroleum Institute further strengthened my view. Later, I left the Petroleum Institute, but my grievances were not eliminated. In September 1955, I published "Chemical Research in Universities and Colleges - A Trilogy" in the Chemistry Bulletin. This article had a very bad influence, because it not only led readers to the conclusion that outsiders cannot lead insiders, but also could be extended to the impression that the Party cannot lead science. The argument that outsiders cannot lead has two aspects:
    (1) Only insiders can lead; (2) Outsiders cannot lead. Both aspects are absurd. First, let's see what results from the first argument. I studied colloid chemistry and am an outsider to organic chemistry; people who study organic chemistry may not be insiders to colloid chemistry. There are many categories of chemistry, and it is impossible for one person to be an insider to all of them, so according to this argument, no one can lead chemical research. By extension, no one can lead science. As a result, Chinese science becomes an anarchic state. This road is clearly a dead end. Now let's look at the second argument - can outsiders lead? In 1956, I participated in the work of scientific planning. At first, I was completely clueless, thinking that as long as the Party announced the outline of the order of construction in our country, scientists could choose research projects based on their specialties and formulate plans, and everything would be fine. At that time, a person who considered himself an insider had such an empty idea for scientific planning—the specific leadership of science—and there was more than just me with similarly vague ideas. This method actually accepts the principle of the Party's leadership but specifically denies it. It is not only empty but also has many drawbacks, because in this way, one can justifiably conduct research for science under the empty banner of developing science without being criticized. In fact, scientific planning is carried out like this: the Party puts forward several tasks according to the needs of the country, divides the tasks into several central problems, then divides the central problems into several specific research projects, and then formulates specific measures according to needs and possibilities, the present and the future. From the number and duration of personnel training, the planning of instruments and equipment, how to fill the gaps in disciplines, and so on, all major and minor items are settled. This is very specific and can be implemented. Using tasks to drive research and using research to complete tasks is a world of difference compared to the empty plans conceived by many "insiders." At that time, many of the people leading the planning were so-called "outsiders." They are indeed outsiders to handling test tubes, but they are not outsiders to leading people who can handle test tubes; they are insiders. Why can they lead, while people like us who consider ourselves insiders cannot lead? The reason is obvious. The reason why the plan is complete is because the tasks are put forward based on the needs of 600 million people; the reason why the methods are specific is because the leaders are collectivists and also master Marxism-Leninism, which enables them to give play to the wisdom and abilities of the masses, while old-fashioned scientists are mostly individualists. The wisdom and abilities of one or two people, no matter how great, are naturally very small compared to the wisdom and abilities of the masses. The above is just the method of leadership, now let's see how the results of the leadership are. Since liberation, the scale and speed of development in transportation, water conservancy, minerals, agriculture, and various industries have all been unprecedented, and these are all highly technical undertakings. The quantity and quality of young talents cultivated in cultural and educational undertakings every year are also incomparable to those before liberation. In terms of research results, some departments have reached the international level. Recently, the plan for large, medium, small, and small-sized nitrogen fertilizer plants proposed in the field of chemical fertilizers will soon be realized. This is a major event with revolutionary significance in the chemical industry. These are just some of the achievements, but they are already unimaginable to old-fashioned scientists. Therefore, the amazing achievements in just seven or eight years are also the result of Marxism-Leninism plus collectivism. From the above facts, the argument that outsiders cannot lead insiders is truly a frog-in-the-well view, which is self-defeating. At that time, the reason why I put forward this absurd argument was based on the narrow viewpoint of the bourgeoisie, and I did not recognize the greatness of collectivism at all. In fact, since 1949, the question of who leads whom has no longer existed.
    During the double-anti movement, I reread "The Trilogy." With the help of my comrades, I realized that there were also very serious mistakes in it, the seriousness of which was no less than the absurd argument that outsiders cannot lead insiders. When I wrote "The Trilogy," I still thought that I was following the Party's leadership in terms of policies and guidelines, except for scientific research. This is self-deception. The Party also has policies and guidelines in scientific research. Denying the Party's leadership in science is tantamount to denying the Party's policies and guidelines.
    The greatness of the achievements of the scientific, cultural, and educational undertakings since liberation is something I know and something I have hoped for in my life, but I did not mention it at all in "The Trilogy," but instead, I complained and greatly exaggerated some shortcomings. What is the reason? At that time, I thought this was out of patriotic enthusiasm, pointing out shortcomings in the hope of improvement, but upon careful analysis, the dominant thought when I started writing was still "outsiders cannot lead insiders." If I really hoped for improvement, why was the tone so resentful and devoid of the friendly atmosphere of treating comrades with kindness? This not only showed my arrogance and conceit, but also revealed my feelings. As mentioned earlier, I have a good impression of bourgeois thoughts. Whenever I encounter things that contradict bourgeois thoughts, I more or less have a sense of resistance. The Party's policies and guidelines are to realize socialism, and all measures in schools are naturally aimed at this. This means that they contradict bourgeois thoughts. Therefore, I was often dissatisfied. In the final analysis, it is still a matter of political standpoint. A person who stands on the bourgeois standpoint cannot wholeheartedly obey the leadership of the Party. In the past, I thought I was following the Party wholeheartedly, which was completely self-deception. With the patient enlightenment of my comrades, I now truly realize the necessity of ideological remolding.
    During the double-anti movement, the fierce firepower of comrades and students woke me up, otherwise I would not have recognized that there were so many toxins in my thinking. If they are not thoroughly eradicated, I do not know how much harm they will bring to the youth. I now have the courage to surrender to the truth, determined to change my political stance, stand on the left, seriously transform my thinking, establish a new outlook on life, and strive to become a red and expert intellectual of the working class in the shortest possible time.

    向真理投降
    北京大学化学系教授　傅鹰
    在双反运动以前，由于站在资产阶级的立场，我对于许多事物有严重的错误看法，其中最突出的是对思想改造和对党的领导的看法。
    关于思想改造
    在三反运动中我的收获是很大的。那时我有亲美恐美的思想。经过三反运动，此种思想彻底打垮了，分清了敌我。后来我荣幸地参加了赴朝慰问团，在朝鲜看见听见志愿军无数的英勇事迹，深深感动，在敌我立场上站得更稳了。但是因为我出身于封建家庭，长期受资产阶级教育，许多资产阶级思想在我心中根深蒂固。三反的重点是分清敌我，故对于一般的资产阶级思想批判得不透，而且我认为批评时的态度有些粗暴，故此未能将其打倒。再加上我有爱国、历史清白、为人正直等包袱，认为我已经决心跟着共产党走，政治立场已经没有问题了，对于政治的要求极低。我又是有纯技术观点的人，认为只要将化学知识传给学生就是为人民服务，因此对于政治学习不关心。久而久之，资产阶级思想不但不比三反结束时减少，反而占了上风，使我抱残守缺将旧货当作宝贝，认为我已经没有要不得的思想。要想将这些旧货扫除，就会引起反感，因此五年来我在思想上毫无进步。
    双反运动开始后，我看见北大化学系毕业生的废品展览会，使我大吃一惊，因为那些学生中有不少是我教过的，不可能没有受到我的影响。自那时起我开始怀疑我的思想是否要得，后来听了彭真同志的报告，他说资产阶级知识分子自幼至长全是在资产阶级的学校中受教育，那能有社会主义的思想。现在我们要走进社会主义了，必须将旧思想丢掉（大意如此），这句话惊醒了我。接着看了许多学生的大字报，才知道我给他们带来了多大的损害。这个发现使我万分难过，因为我在腐蚀他们的纯洁心灵。自青年讲助的大字报及谈话中，知道有不少的青年教师以我为旗帜，向白专进军。至此我对于我在北大青年中的危害性才充分的认识了。我痛恨自己，自问为何会产生这么大的恶果。经过同志们的不断帮助和自己思想的激烈斗争，我终于认识到这是站在资产阶级立场的人在教学上必然产生的结果。我也体会到，要想真正的解决问题，只有彻底的改变立场。现在回顾从前逃避思想改造的理由，没有一个是站得住的。我自命是爱国的人，但是对爱国二字的体会却是非常空洞的，只是一种由于久受异族压迫而引起的民族情感。在未解放时，此种感情还有其积极作用，但是到了今天祖国已经走向社会主义，而我的爱国还停留在狭隘的民族立场阶段，那就太不够了。在今天，一个真正爱国的人，首先必须爱共产党，一心一意地跟着党走社会主义的道路；要想走社会主义的路，就必须彻底地铲除与社会主义抵触的资产阶级思想；要想铲除这种思想，就必须接受思想改造。我却逃避改造。这能算爱国么？显然不能。我又是一个自命正直的人。正直就是有勇气向恶势力作斗争，也有勇气改正错误。在国民党时代，我不敢批评。到了忍无可忍时，我逃往美国，钻进象牙之塔。到今天共产党正领着六亿人民走向光明，我却借口正直，忽视思想改造，这是有勇气改正错误么？这种“勇气”不是正直而是歪曲。我自以为是跟着党走，政治立场已无问题。倘若真是跟着走，立场当然没有问题，但是党以六亿人民的意志为意志，走社会主义的路，我是照自己的意志，走资产阶级的路。南辕北辙，怎能说是跟着党走呢？更真实一些是背着党走。我认为我以传授化学为人民服务，学习不学习政治没有关系。化学诚然没有阶级性，但是掌握化学的人却不能没有阶级性。对于一个个人主义者，化学只为他或少数人服务；对于一个社会主义者，化学才是六亿人民的。我以个人主义为主导思想来教导同学，这就是拉他们后腿，哪里能算是为人民服务。就是这样的初步分析，不需要思想改造的理由已经全部破产了。由此可见，我不愿意接受思想改造的真正理由，只是舍不得丢弃早已臭了的资产阶级思想。最初所持的理由只是在无理由中为自己找理由来骗自己，久而久之也就信以为真了。
    关于党的领导
    1953年我到了石油学院。那时学校才成立，设备当然很差。我想开始化学研究，但仪器、药品、实验室全不够。当时我不仔细考虑一个新成立的学校有多少比研究更重要的事需要进行，就认为院领导不支持我；他所以不支持，是因为他不懂化学。我是一个狂妄自大而具有纯技术观点的人，认为在文教事业中，外行人可以在方针政策上领导，对于科学技术的具体领导就必须是内行人才行。石油学院的经历更坚定了我的这种看法。后来我离开了石油学院，但满腹怨气并未消除。1955年9月我在化学通报发表了“高等学校的化学研究——一个三部曲”。这篇文章产生了极大的坏影响，因为它不但使读者得到外行不能领导内行的结论，还可以推广而得到党不能领导科学的印象。外行不能领导的论点有两方面：
    （1）只有内行才能领导；（2）外行不能领导。无论哪一方面全是荒谬的。先看从第一个论点得什么结果。我是学胶体化学的，对于有机化学就是外行；学有机的人对于胶体也未必内行。化学的门类繁多，不可能有一个人对于各门全是内行，因此根据这个论点就没有人能领导化学研究了。推而广之，更没有人能领导科学了。结果中国的科学就成了无政府状态。这条路显然是死路。现在看看第二个论点——外行人能不能领导。1956年我参加了科学规划工作。起初我完全心中无数，以为只要党宣布一下我国的建设次序的轮廓，科学家根据自己的专长选择研究项目，制定计划就万事大吉了。那时一个自命为内行的人对于科学规划——科学的具体领导的办法就是如此空洞，而想法同样模糊的还不止我一人。此种办法实际是对党的领导原则接受，具体否定，不但空洞，而且流弊百出，因为如此一来，就可以名正言顺地在这个空空洞洞的发展科学的大帽子下进行为科学而科学的研究而不受批评。实际上科学规划是这样进行的：党根据国家的需要提出若干任务，将任务分为若干中心问题，再将中心问题分为若干具体的研究项目，然后再根据需要与可能，目前和将来，拟定具体的措施。自培养人材的数目和年限，仪器设备之筹划，空白学科的如何填满等等大小节目皆有着落。这样就十分具体，可以执行了。以任务带动研究，以研究完成任务，比起许多“内行人”所想的空洞无物的计划真是天渊之别。当时领导作规划的人有许多是所谓的“外行人”。他们对于拿试管的确是外行，但对于领导会拿试管的人却不是外行而是内行。为何他们能够领导，而像我们这样自命为内行的人却不会领导？理由是很明显的。规划之所以完备，因为任务是根据六亿人民的需要而提出来的；办法之所以具体，因为领导的人是集体主义者，又掌握了马列主义，能够发挥群众的智慧能力，而旧式的科学家却多半是个人主义者。一两个人的智慧能力，无论多么大，比起群众的智慧能力自然十分渺小。以上只是领导的方法，现在再看看领导的结果如何。解放以来，交通、水利、矿产、农业以及各种工业的发展规模与速度全是史无前例的，而这些全是技术性很高的事业。在文教事业中每年培养出来的青年人材之量和质也全是和解放前不能相提并论的。在研究成果方面有些部门已达到国际水平。最近在化学肥料方面提出的大、中、小、小小型氮肥厂的计划立将实现。这是在化学工业中具有革命意义的一件大事。这些只是一部分成就而已，但已是旧式的老科学家所梦想不到的。所以在短短的七八年中能有此惊人成绩，又是马列主义加集体主义的结果。自上举的事实，外行不能领导内行的论点真是井蛙之见，不攻自破了。那时我之所以提出这个荒谬的论点是根据资产阶级的狭隘观点出发，根本不认识集体主义之伟大。其实自1949年以来，谁领导谁的问题就已经不存在了。
    在双反运动中我重读“三部曲”。经过同志们的帮助，我才发现其中还有很严重的错误，其严重性并不下于外行不能领导内行的荒谬论点。当写“三部曲”时，我还以为除了科学研究以外，在方针政策上我是服从党的领导的。这是自欺欺人之谈。在科学研究中党也有方针政策，否定了党对科学的领导，就等于否定了党的方针政策。
    解放后科学文教事业成绩之伟大是我所知道的，也是我生平所希望的，但是我在“三部曲”一文中却全未提起，而是满腹牢骚地举出一些缺点并将其大为夸大。原因何在？当时自以为这是出于爱国热忱，指出缺点，希望能够改善，但是仔细分析起来，动笔时的主导思想还是“外行不能领导内行”。倘若真是希望改善，何以语气却是怨气冲天，毫无对待同志的与人为善的气味？这不但表现出我的狂妄自大，而且流露出我的感情。前已提过，我对于资产阶级思想是有好感的。凡是遇到与资产阶级思想矛盾的事物，就或多或少地有抵触情绪。党的方针政策是实现社会主义，学校中的一切措施自然也以此为目的。这也就是说，与资产阶级思想矛盾。因此我就常常不满了。归根结底还是政治立场问题。一个站在资产阶级立场的人不可能一心一意的服从党的领导。从前自以为在一心跟着党走，完全是自欺欺人。经过同志们的耐心启发，现在我才真正地认识到思想改造的必要性。
    双反运动中同志、同学们的猛烈火力将我烧醒，否则我还不认识我的思想中有那许多毒素。若不将其彻底铲除，不知更会给青年带来多少危害。我现在有勇气向真理投降，下定决心改变政治立场，站到左边来，郑重其事的改造思想，建立新的人生观，争取在最短期间成为一个又红又专的工人阶级的知识分子。
