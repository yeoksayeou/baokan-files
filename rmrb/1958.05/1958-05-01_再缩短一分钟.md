    Shorten It By One More Minute
    Pan Hongyu, Fushun Open-Pit Mine
    To meet the mine newspaper's need for an article discussing the content of the national plan, I went to interview Wang Futang, the driver of electric shovel No. 801. It was just the time when the drivers were changing shifts. People were gathered in the休息室 [xiū xī shì - rest area/lounge] around an old man with a pale beard. On the wooden table was a piece of paper with some haphazard arithmetic problems.
    "I just can't figure out this number. How do you calculate this percentage?..." This was the question raised by the old man.
    The old man was Zhou Zhenyao, the driver on electric shovel No. 801, and Wang Futang was his apprentice. He was seventy-five years old this year and was living in a nursing home.
    Last Sunday, Zhou Zhenyao learned from an old partner in the electric shovel crew that electric shovel No. 801 was currently encountering a workface with unfavorable conditions, taking five minutes longer to load a train of coal than other electric shovels. This morning, he asked the head of the nursing home for leave, saying he was going out to see a friend, but in reality, he came here.
    As soon as Zhou Zhenyao saw Wang Futang, he asked in a reproaching tone, "What's wrong? Don't you want to catch up with England? Other electric shovels are shortening loading times, but you're lengthening them?"
    Without waiting for Wang Futang to answer, he had everyone in the休息室 [xiū xī shì - rest area/lounge] do the calculations. After the calculations, he asked Wang Futang for a set of protective clothing, rolled up his sleeves, and pushed his hat to the back of his head:
    "Let's go!" he called to Wang Futang, "I'm doing volunteer labor today."
    Electric shovel No. 801 was in a火区 [huǒ qū - fire zone/area prone to spontaneous combustion]. As soon as we entered the workface, it was filled with smoke, and we couldn't see people's faces. We could only hear the sound of the electric drills making holes and the rushing sound of the electric shovel loading coal. Zhou Zhenyao climbed up the iron ladder and jumped onto the shovel. He climbed onto the motor to listen to the sound, squatted in front of the transformer and sniffed, saying, "Futang! Is there an oil leak in the motor shaft area?..."
    "A little bit..."
    The old man found a piece of scrap thin iron on the electric shovel, disassembled something like a spoon, and attached it to the leaking oil area.
    "A drop of sweat, a drop of oil. How can you be so careless!" the old man said in a reproaching tone, and Wang Futang blushed.
    At this time, the electric locomotive had already entered the workface. The old man sat on the driver's seat, holding the brake lever, staring intently, full of energy, like a tank driver on the front lines. Wang Futang and I held our breath and watched the old man operate.
    The old man started loading the first car. It took Wang Futang an average of five to six minutes to load one car. The old man loaded the first car in only four and a half minutes.
    "Shorten it by another half minute," he said to himself. Sure enough, the second car was loaded half a minute faster.
    A whole train (eleven cars) was loaded, and I looked at my watch, and it only took fifty minutes, seven minutes less than Wang Futang's loading time. At this time, the smoke in the workface was getting heavier, and Wang Futang wanted to call the fire extinguishing area to put out the fire. Zhou Zhenyao asked, "How long will it take for the fire extinguishing team to get here?"
    "Thirty minutes."
    "Forget it! Don't call them!..." The old man got off the electric shovel himself, picked up the fire hose, and sprayed water on the fire on the workface. The smoke in the workface lessened a bit. The second train entered the workface again, and the old man put down the hose and got back on the electric shovel to load coal.
    "Shorten it by one more minute," the old man murmured to himself again.
    The second train really was loaded one minute faster than the first train. After the train left the workface, Wang Futang pressed the old man for "tips." The old man said, "There's no need to ask me, just ask yourself if you have a sense of ownership,.... You don't think of fixing the oil leak in the electric shovel's motor shaft; the fire in the workface is getting bigger, and you still wait for people from the fire extinguishing area to come... Can that be allowed?" Then he explained how to operate in the workface.
    Just as he was speaking enthusiastically, the electric shovel team leader came with a person. As soon as this person saw the old man, he exclaimed in delight:
    "Oh! My dear old Zhou, the whole nursing home staff has been looking for you for half a day. We even notified the radio station and asked them to help find you. After all that, you were here!"

    再缩短一分钟
    抚顺露天矿　潘洪玉
    为了矿报需要讨论国家计划内容的稿子，我去采访了801号电铲司机王福堂。那正是司机们交接班的时候，人们在休息室里围着个苍白胡子的老人，木条桌子上摆着张纸，列着一些横七竖八的算术题。
    “我就蹩不出这个数来，你们算算这百分比怎么求？……”这是那个老人提出的问题。
    这老人叫周振耀，是801号电铲上的司机，王福堂正是他的徒弟。他今年七十五岁了，在养老院里养老。
    上个星期日，周振耀从电铲班的一个老伙伴那里知道了：801号电铲现在正遇到一个条件不好的掌子，装一列车煤比别的电铲要多费五分钟。今天早晨他就找养老员组长请假，说是到外面看朋友去，其实就是上这儿来了。
    周振耀一见着王福堂就带着责备的口吻问：“怎么？你不想赶过英国啊？人家别的电铲都缩短装车时间，你怎么倒延长装车时间呢？”
    他不等王福堂回答，就让大伙在休息室里算账。算完了账他向王福堂要了身劳动保护服，挽了挽袖子，把帽子往后脑勺上一推：
    “走！”他叫着王福堂：“我今天是义务劳动。”
    801号电铲是在火区（掌子自然发火地区）掌子里。一进掌子烟气腾腾，对面都看不清人的面貌，只能听见电钻机穿孔的响声和电铲装车时哗啦啦的转声。周振耀攀着铁梯一纵身就上了铲。他爬到马达上听听声，蹲在变压器跟前嗅了嗅说：“福堂！马达轴这块儿漏油啊？……”
    “漏一点点……。”
    老人家在电铲上找了块废薄铁片，拆了个像匙似的东西，接着漏油的地方。
    “一滴汗，一滴油。大手大脚的怎么能行！”老人家带着责备的口吻说，王福堂脸红了。
    这时候电机车已经开进了掌子，老人家坐上了司机台，拿着闸把，瞪着眼睛，精神抖擞，简直像个前线的坦克驾驶员。我和王福堂屏住气息看老人家操作。
    老人家开始装头一个车了。王福堂装一个车平均得五分到六分钟。老人家装完头一个车才用了四分半。
    “再缩短半分钟”他自言自语地说。果然装第二个车缩短了半分钟。
    一排车（十一个车箱）装完了，我看了看表才用了五十分钟，比王福堂装车少用七分钟。这时，掌子里的烟越发的大了，王福堂要打电话找消火区来消火。周振耀问：“消火的到这儿得多长时间？”
    “三十分钟。”
    “算了！别打了！……”老人家自己下了电铲，操起消火的水龙，浇开了掌子上的火。掌子里的烟小了点，第二次列车又进了掌子，老人家放下水龙又上电铲装起车来。
    “再缩短一分钟。”老人家又自言自语的念叨着。
    第二次列车真的就比第一次列车缩短一分钟。车开出了掌子，王福堂就追问老人家“窍门”，老人家说：“这不用问我，就问问你自己有没有当家作主的思想，……。电铲上的马达轴漏油你不想法治一治；掌子里烟火大了还非等着消火区来人……；这能行吗？”接着他就讲在掌子里应该怎样操作。
    正讲的起劲，电铲班班长领着一个人来了，这个人一见老人家就喜出望外地嚷道：
    “哎呀！我的老周大爷，全养老院的工作人员找您够半天了，我们连广播电台都通知了，让他们帮忙找找您，闹了半天您还在这里呀！”
