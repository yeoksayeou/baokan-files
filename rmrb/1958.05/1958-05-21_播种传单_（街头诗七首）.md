Sowing Leaflets (Seven Street Poems)
Tian Jian
  Challenge
  Hang the challenge to the big willow tree by the spring.
  We want to sow the seeds of happiness, even if it means shedding sweat!
  If it doesn't rain from the sky, we will still have a great harvest!

  Seize the Time
  The sun sets, we work under the moon,
  If it doesn’t rain, we’ll use sweat;
  We must challenge the heavens,
  To fight with it for time.
  If there is no water, we will dig a spring,
  If it doesn’t rain, we will carry water;
  Overthrow all difficulties,
  Determined to conquer nature!

  To the Commune Leader
  The commune leader goes down to the fields,
  To plant sweet potatoes for a yield of ten thousand catties.
  Cadres become apprentices,
  Old farmers become masters.
  A yield of ten thousand catties per mu of sweet potatoes,
  Leads us to the road of happiness.
  Gods and Spirits（note）
  Hang up Chairman Mao's portrait,
  So we can see the sunlight day and night.
  Old Lord, I offer you sacrifices,
  But you are not as bright as the sun.
  We will call on ghosts and spirits to abdicate,
  We have our own good ideas.
  Seventh Uncle and Eighth Aunt, get lost,
  We are the Jade Emperor on earth.

    （Note）News from Wanquan County says that the county has received more than 10,000 offerings, all voluntarily sent by the masses. They have a slogan: "We will call on ghosts and spirits to abdicate!"
    This slogan is right. This is a battle against the heavens during the spring drought!

    Hands and Courage
  Without peasants,
  Where would there be mountains of grain?
  We peasants,
  Are not afraid of difficulties –
  Hard work is our hands,
  Diligent work is our courage!

  A Word from a Party Member
  Instead of fighting the state for a mouthful,
  Better to fight the land for a peck;
  Split the mountain and you can summon rain,
  Dig a ditch and there will be clear springs flowing.

      Sower
  If it is a seed, it must be sown in the ground,
  Once sown, it must be made to sprout.
  If there are difficulties, they must be defeated,
  We must mount the steed that travels a thousand li!

    播种传单　（街头诗七首）
    田间
  挑战书泉边大柳树，挂起挑战书。要播幸福种，哪怕流汗珠？天上不下雨，也要大丰收！
  抢时间太阳落，月下干，不落雨，就用汗；要向天公挑战，要和它抢时间。没有水，就挖泉，不下雨，就担水；推倒一切难关，决心征服大自然！
  给社长社长走下地，来种万斤薯。干部当学徒，老农当师傅。亩产万斤薯，走上幸福路。人和神（注）挂起毛主席的像，日夜能见到阳光。老君爷我供上你，见了太阳也不亮。我们叫鬼神退位，自有我们好主张。七爷子八奶子滚吧，我们是地上的玉皇。
    （注）万全县的消息，说县里收到供物一万多件，都是群众自愿送来的。他们有一个口号：要叫鬼神退位！
    这个口号提的对。这是在春旱时向天公的一战！
    手和胆
  没有庄稼汉，
  哪有米粮山？
  我们庄稼汉，
  不怕有难关——
  硬干就是手，
  苦干就是胆！
  一位党员的话
  谁要向国家争一口，
  不如向地里争一斗；
  劈开山就能唤到雨，
  挖开渠就有清泉流。
      播种员
  是种子就要种下地，
  种下地就叫它发芽。
  有难关一定要打垮，
  一定要跨上千里马！
