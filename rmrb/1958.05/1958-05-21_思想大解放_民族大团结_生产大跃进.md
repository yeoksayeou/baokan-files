Great Ideological Emancipation, Great National Unity, Great Leap Forward in Production
First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wulanfu
    Since the rectification campaign, especially after the Third Plenary Session, a movement of great ideological emancipation, great national unity, and great leap forward in production has begun to take shape throughout the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
    The ideological emancipation movement is deepening step by step. We have conducted struggles on four issues: 1. Opposing dogmatism and empiricism; 2. Opposing right-leaning conservative thinking; 3. Opposing nationalism, mainly local nationalism; 4. Opposing the "three winds" and "five airs" that violate the mass line. Opposing dogmatism and empiricism is especially important in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This is because cadres in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region come from Northeast, North China, Northwest and other regions, absorbing the rich experience of "Three Norths," which is an important factor in the rapid development of all aspects of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's work. However, some cadres often fail to go deep into their work, and often mechanically apply the experience of other regions, departing from reality and the masses. The most prominent manifestation of right-leaning conservative thinking is exaggerating Inner Mongolia's backwardness, failing to see the tremendous progress and changes of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region over the past eleven years, and believing that Inner Mongolia cannot have a great leap forward. They use Inner Mongolia's backwardness to cover up their right-leaning conservatism. We criticized this "Inner Mongolia Backwardness Theory." Of course, due to historical reasons, the economy and culture of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region do have some backward aspects, such as low agricultural yield per unit area, unstable animal husbandry production, and a weak industrial base. The problem is not whether to admit backwardness, but how to treat backwardness. There are two attitudes towards backwardness: one is to acknowledge backwardness, refuse to be backward, and transform backwardness into advancement, which is the attitude of communists; the other is to succumb to backwardness and be content with backwardness, which runs counter to our general line. We resolutely oppose the second attitude.
    
    Emancipating the Mind is the Foundation of the Leap Forward and Unity
    
    Ideological emancipation has led to the liberation of productive forces. Many things that people dared not think or do in the past have begun to be thought and done. For example, in developing water conservancy, the original plan was to expand the irrigated area by two million mu this year. Later, it was increased to three million mu. Now, 8.5 million mu have been completed. Together with the existing irrigated land, it has reached more than 20 million mu, with an average of three mu of irrigated land per person. It is estimated that the irrigated area can be expanded by 10 million mu this year. Strive to have an average of five to six mu of irrigated land per person by 1962. Starting this year, regardless of drought or flood, we can have surplus grain to hand over to the state to support the socialist construction of the motherland. The masses in pastoral areas broke the traditional practice of not digging wells in winter, braving severe cold of minus 35 to 40 degrees Celsius, and completed more than 200 wells. In terms of production targets and production measures, they broke the original idea of not daring to leap forward. About 1,000 cooperatives plan to achieve a yield of 400 jin of grain per mu this year. A new upsurge has emerged in the technical reform movement, such as adding fertilizer boxes to seeders, converting cultivators into seeders, using wooden pipes instead of iron pipes to drill artesian wells, and using large cart wheels to modify water lifting tools. Along with the upsurge in agriculture and animal husbandry, industry has also surged. The movement of the whole party and the whole people running industry has begun. More than 10,000 factories are planned to be built this year. So far, nearly 2,000 factories have been built and put into production. Industry and handicrafts have also played an active role in supporting the great leap forward in agriculture and animal husbandry. Nine small universal tractors, wind-powered water pumps, and animal-powered generators have been successfully trial-produced.
    
    Great Ideological Emancipation, Great Leap Forward in Production, has brought about a new atmosphere of great national unity. In terms of national issues, the rectification and anti-rightist struggle focused on opposing local nationalism, digging out 67 rightists in the field of national issues, and achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological front. The level of Marxism-Leninism and the proletarian consciousness of cadres of all ethnic groups have been greatly improved. With the development of industry, the working class among the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities has gradually grown. At present, there are 60,000 Mongolian and other ethnic minority cadres and workers in the region, of which about 6,000 are industrial workers. In the great leap forward in production, people of all ethnic groups work side by side, further improving ethnic relations, and also strengthening the labor viewpoint of the Mongolian and other ethnic minority people. In pastoral areas, some of the barriers to the Han working people have been greatly changed. Many pastoral cooperatives have absorbed the Han herdsmen who were hired in the past as members of the cooperative. In the past, pastoral areas were unwilling to plant trees and build houses, fearing that the Han people would live in the pastoral areas for a long time. Now, the people in the pastoral areas welcome the Han working people to go to the pastoral areas to help dig wells and help plant feed. The demand and enthusiasm of Mongolian farmers and herdsmen to learn Chinese and Mandarin in order to absorb the advanced experience of the Han people is constantly growing. Mutual assistance among ethnic groups has greatly developed. In the water conservancy construction movement, a relatively large Han agricultural cooperative in Bikqi Town, Tumote Banner, saw that a nearby smaller Mongolian ethnic agricultural cooperative had labor shortages, so it decided to send ten laborers with their own rations to help dig wells. The two cooperatives welcomed and sent each other off with gongs and drums, and a new atmosphere of socialist national relations appeared between the Mongolian and Han nationalities. At the same time, the great leap forward in production also mobilized the most backward stratum - religious professionals. There are nearly 20,000 lamas in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Now, except for more than 3,000 people who still live in temples and do not engage in labor production, more than 10,000 people have participated in production to varying degrees. Many have joined cooperatives and become members. A living Buddha requested to set up a cooperative, and we have approved it.
    
    Develop Industry, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Rapidly, Well and Economically
    
    According to the general line of building socialism, we have revised the development plan for industry, agriculture and animal husbandry in the autonomous region during the second five-year plan. The main content is to complete the requirements of the ten-year plan in agriculture and animal husbandry in five years. By 1962, the average yield of grain in the region will reach 400 jin per mu, the number of livestock will increase to 40 million head, the amount of forest logging will reach 8.4 million cubic meters per year, and the local industry will produce 1 million tons of pig iron per year, 600,000 tons of steel (excluding Baotou Steel), and 12 million tons of coal. By then, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's local industry will establish seven networks, namely: agricultural and animal husbandry machinery manufacturing and repair network, fertilizer production and supply network, power network, coal supply network, agricultural, animal husbandry and sideline product processing and manufacturing network, transportation network, and postal and telecommunications network. Agriculture and animal husbandry will basically achieve five modernizations, namely: farmland water conservancy, mechanized farming, rural and pastoral area electrification, fertilizer chemicalization, and transport bearingization. By then, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will become one of the national steel industry bases, one of the grain bases, one of the livestock and livestock product bases, and one of the forest industry bases. In order to achieve this plan, we are prepared to do a good job in the comprehensive utilization of resources, accelerate the construction of mountainous and forest areas, develop mineral resources, give full play to the potential of agriculture and animal husbandry, rationally allocate labor and technical forces, conscientiously implement the policy of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, realize the whole party running industry and the whole people running industry, and require comrades in Inner Mongolia who run industry to establish the viewpoint of serving agricultural and animal husbandry production. We require the party committees above the banner and county level in rural and pastoral areas to grasp agriculture and animal husbandry on the one hand and industry on the other. Technical revolution has special importance for Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. It is necessary to strive to achieve mechanization in three to five years, carry out large-scale mass technical reform movements, and pay attention to cultivating technical forces to meet the needs of the great leap forward in production.
    
    In terms of animal husbandry, we are actively realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry. Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region plans to set up 1,000 cooperatives and 40 joint state-private ranches this year. After these cooperatives are built, the number of households joining the cooperatives will reach 50% or more of the total number of households. Originally, we planned to realize the cooperation of animal husbandry in three to five years. Now it seems that it can be done in about two years. In order to ensure the stable development of animal husbandry production, we are currently concentrating our efforts on solving the problem of water and grass. Experience has proved that with cooperatives and the problem of water and grass solved, snowstorms are not terrible. The Chenbaerhu Banner in Inner Mongolia has a better foundation for mutual aid and cooperation. The masses have the habit of harvesting and storing grass. In the snowstorms of previous years, there were few livestock deaths. The Balinyou Banner has a pastoral cooperative with 206 households and 12,000 head of livestock. This cooperative is called "Happiness Road." They have built water conservancy facilities and feed bases, and each livestock has stored 500 jin of grass and 100 jin of feed. The livestock have basically overcome the unstable situation of "autumn fat, winter thin, and spring death," and have achieved full fat and meat all year round. Animal husbandry has developed stably. This cooperative also built a hydropower station and lit electric lights. In order to solve the problem of water and grass, we have grasped three things: digging wells and utilizing surface water sources in pastoral areas, harvesting grass and improving grasslands, and building feed bases. We strive to basically eliminate waterless grasslands and solve the problem of water supply for people and animals and irrigation of some feed bases in pastoral areas within three to five years. We have vigorously built feed bases in pastoral areas, advocated that each cooperative and each team plant feed, with the masses as the main force, and state-owned farms and ranches also plant a large amount. This year, two grassland machinery service stations and thirty mechanized grass breeding stations have been newly built in pastoral areas.
    
    Combine Agriculture, Forestry and Animal Husbandry to Transform Deserts
    
    Transforming deserts is also a historical task we are prepared to complete. Deserts in Inner Mongolia cover about 150,000 square kilometers, accounting for one-tenth of the region's area. Most of these deserts are in Bamen and Yimen pastoral areas, and some are in agricultural areas. Deserts have brought great difficulties to production. Desert movement has damaged farmland and pastures, blocked transportation, and caused great disasters. For example, the desert and semi-desert areas in western Inner Mongolia have been hit by droughts for two consecutive years, and livestock losses have been heavy. The recent spring rain spread across the agricultural areas, but it did not fall in the desert and semi-desert areas, or it fell very little. To this day, those pastoral areas, pasture growth can not be achieved, is facing the threat of a consecutive third year of drought. Transforming deserts can reap huge benefits in just a few years. According to calculations by Bayannur League, planting sand jujubes to fix sand can form forests in three or four years. One mu of sand jujube forest produces 3,000 jin of leaves, tender branches, and sand jujubes, which can be used to raise two sheep. According to this calculation, transforming 10,000 square kilometers of desert can increase pastures for tens of millions of livestock, and the benefits are great. In addition, there are many valuable mineral deposits in desert and Gobi areas, and after transforming the deserts, it will be convenient to develop these minerals. In the work of transforming deserts, we have grasped some situations and found some sand-fixing plants. We have a desert research team, which has been working for more than a year, and has conducted some investigations and research on some desert areas. The most serious harm of deserts is mobile deserts. There are some oases between mobile deserts and fixed deserts. Some places in the desert lack water, and some places have groundwater. Many suitable plants have been found to grow in the desert, such as saxaul, artemisia, seabuckthorn, sand rice (sand radish), sand jujube, stinky cypress, poplar, sand willow, hamat...etc. In Zhaowuda League, Jirem League, Yikezhao League, and Bayannur League, the masses have fought with the deserts for many years. The two leagues of Zhe and Zhao have built sand prevention forests and sealed sand to cultivate grass and forests of more than 210,000 hectares. The "Happiness Cooperative" in Dengkou County has 379 households. After eight years of struggle, they have conquered the shifting sands. In the past, desert damage was very serious here. Over the past three or four decades, the desert has moved three or four miles eastward, the trunk canal has been rerouted seven times, and 2,500 mu of fertile land has been swallowed by sand. They describe the situation at that time as: "The desert ruthlessly presses on the farmland, forcing people to move their homes." After liberation, they organized to control the sand. They summed up the experience of sand control: "Sand has one joy and three fears. One joy is that it likes strong winds and drought, and three fears are that it fears water, grass, and trees." They adopted methods of building wind barriers, sealing sand to cultivate grass, and creating forests to prevent sand to control sand. They planted 1.6 million trees in eight years. Now, 80% of the shifting sands have been basically fixed, grain production has greatly increased, and thousands of sheep have been raised in the forests. They describe the current situation as: "East is facing the Yellow River, and west is facing the sand. Cultivating grass and creating forests is a good way. After eight years of management, the Yellow Dragon is subdued, and there are people in the green trees." In order to transform the deserts, we have formulated a preliminary plan and established leading institutions and scientific research institutes for transforming deserts. The policy is: Combining desert transformation with the development of animal husbandry, and combining with the development of agriculture and forestry. From near to far, from easy to difficult, small deserts rely on mass transformation, and large deserts are organized by national professional teams and combined with mass sand control. The method is: sealing sand to cultivate grass, creating sand prevention forest belts, diverting water to irrigate sand, and widely scattering sand prevention plants. Combining artificial sand fixation with mechanical sand fixation. The steps are: first treating 100,000 square kilometers of deserts in a flowing and semi-flowing state. It is required to basically fix the flowing sands that seriously harm agricultural and pastoral production in seven years, and make significant achievements in the transformation of large deserts in fifteen years. Transforming deserts is an arduous task. We are determined to mobilize the people of the entire region and closely cooperate with fraternal provinces and regions to fight for the realization of this task.
    
    Develop Socialist National Relations
    
    In terms of national relations, the main task is to develop new socialist national relations. To this end, we are prepared to vigorously cultivate the national working class, especially industrial workers. In agricultural areas, we vigorously promote mutual learning between people of all ethnic groups, focusing on giving play to the special characteristics of the Mongolian and other ethnic minorities and improving their agricultural production technology. In the great leap forward, the living standards of people of all ethnic groups can be improved to a roughly comparable level. In pastoral and hunting areas, we help them to gradually settle down, transform animal husbandry into a stable and developing economy that combines agriculture and animal husbandry, and transform the hunting economy into an economy that combines agriculture, animal husbandry, wild animal breeding and hunting. For some problems left over from history that must be taken care of, continue to take care of them. The vast majority of ethnic minority cadres in Inner Mongolia were trained and promoted during the two-line struggle during the democratic revolution, during the land reform and the democratic reform in pastoral areas, during the liberation war, and during the cooperation movement. They already have a certain amount of work experience, and most of them have performed well in various practical struggles. The party organization has also greatly developed. There are nearly 30,000 Mongolian party members, 3,500 party members of other ethnic minorities, and there are already more than 4,100 party members and 528 party grassroots organizations in pastoral areas. However, in the rectification and anti-rightist struggle, a small number of rightists also emerged, exposing that many cadres still have the ideological remnants of bourgeois individualism, and there are still many confused ideas on national issues. We are prepared to conduct another general education on the proletarian stand, the Marxist-Leninist worldview, the Marxist-Leninist national view, and the party's mass line among cadres in the fourth stage of the rectification campaign, and give them practical work and labor training so that all ethnic minority cadres can make a leap forward under the principles of communism. After a period of time, a large number of communist-minded ethnic minority cadres with proletarian consciousness and able to closely contact the masses will grow up. In order to enhance economic and cultural exchanges between ethnic groups, we are prepared to do some reform work in the field of language and writing. On the one hand, we advocate learning Mongolian and the Mongolian language among cadres and schools, and give rewards. In some professional departments and schools (for example, departments and schools working in pastoral areas), learning Mongolian and the Mongolian language is designated as a compulsory course, and the proportion is appropriately increased. On the other hand, in Mongolian schools, the school system is changed. The number of years of study for elementary and middle schools using Mongolian and the Mongolian language for teaching is extended by one to two years to learn Chinese and Mandarin. We are prepared to continue to carry out the education of socialist national relations in a big way among the people of all ethnic groups, so that national unity and mutual assistance will become a new social trend among the people in ethnic minority areas. For religious professionals, under the principle of implementing the party's religious policy, we will continue to mobilize them to participate in production labor and often carry out socialist education for them.
    
    The key to realizing a comprehensive leap forward is to strengthen the leadership of the party and continue to carry out the nationwide rectification movement to the end, and strive for a complete victory in the rectification movement. We are prepared to rotate cadres above the level of banner and county party secretaries to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a concentrated manner, transform their thinking, change their style, and improve their level of Marxism-Leninism. The party organizations at all levels in Inner Mongolia must conscientiously implement the instructions of the Central Committee, universally promote the method of planting "experimental fields," so that all leading cadres truly participate in production and lead production, go deep into the masses to lead the masses, and find a set of working methods that combine politics and economy, and politics and technology, so that our staff can truly achieve "both red and expert," and cultivate a large number of strong backbones for leading socialist construction. We must sum up the experience of the close integration and mutual promotion of rectification and production, and in the future, we must do everything with politics in command, so that the cause of socialist transformation and construction in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will develop by leaps and bounds.

    思想大解放　民族大团结　生产大跃进
    中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记　乌兰夫
    内蒙古自治区，经过整风运动特别是三中全会以后，全区已开始形成一个思想大解放、民族大团结和生产大跃进的运动。
    思想解放运动是逐步深入的。我们在四个问题上进行了斗争：一、反对教条主义、经验主义；二、反对右倾保守思想；三、反对民族主义，主要是地方民族主义；四、反对违反群众路线的“三风”、“五气”。反对教条主义和经验主义，在内蒙古自治区更有其重要性。这是因为内蒙古自治区的干部来自东北、华北、西北等地区，吸收了“三北”的丰富经验，是使内蒙古自治区各方面工作迅速发展的重要因素，但是也有些干部由于工作不深入，也常常产生做工作不从内蒙古实际出发，机械搬套外地经验，脱离实际，脱离群众的现象。右倾保守思想最突出的表现为夸大内蒙古的落后面，看不见内蒙古自治区各族人民十一年来的巨大进步和变化，认为内蒙古不能大跃进。用内蒙古落后来掩盖他们的右倾保守。我们批判了这种“内蒙古落后论”。当然，由于历史原因，内蒙古自治区的经济文化也确实有某些落后的方面，如农业单位面积产量不高，牧业生产还不稳定，工业基础薄弱等。问题不在于承认不承认落后，而在于如何对待落后。对待落后有两种态度：一种是承认落后，不甘落后，变落后为先进，这是共产主义者的态度；另一种是屈服于落后，安于落后，这和我们的总路线是背道而驰的。我们坚决反对第二种态度。
    解放思想是跃进和团结的基础
    思想解放带来了生产力的解放，许多过去所不敢想、不敢作的事情，开始敢想敢作了。像发展水利，原来计划今年扩大灌溉面积二百万亩，后来增加到三百万亩，现在已完成八百五十万亩，连同原有的水浇地，已经达到二千多万亩，平均每人已经有三亩水地。估计今年可扩大灌溉面积一千万亩。争取1962年平均每人有五亩到六亩水地。从今年开始，无论天旱雨涝，我们都可以有余粮向国家上缴，支援祖国社会主义建设。牧区群众打破了历来的冬季不打井的常规，冒着零下三十五度到四十度的严寒，打成了二百多眼井。在生产指标和生产措施上，打破了原来不敢跃进的思想，有一千个左右的合作社今年实现每亩产粮四百斤的规划。技术改革运动出现了新的高潮，如群众在播种机上加施肥箱，把铲趟机改成播种机，用木管代替铁管打自流井，用大车轮改作提水工具等。与农业、牧业高涨的同时，工业也高涨起来，全党全民办工业的运动已经开始，今年计划办一万多个厂子，到现在已经有近二千个厂建成投入生产。工业、手工业也发挥了支援农、牧业大跃进的积极性，现在已经试制成功九台小型万能拖拉机、风力抽水机、畜力发电机等。
    思想大解放，生产大跃进，带来了民族大团结的新气象。在民族问题方面，整风、反右派斗争集中的反对了地方民族主义，挖出了六十七个民族问题方面的右派分子，取得了政治思想战线的社会主义革命的伟大胜利，各民族干部马列主义水平和无产阶级觉悟有很大提高。随着工业的发展，蒙古族和各少数民族中的工人阶级已逐渐成长起来，现在全区有六万蒙古族和各少数民族的干部和职工，其中产业工人约六千人。在生产大跃进中，各民族人民并肩劳动，进一步改善了民族关系，同时也加强了蒙古族和各少数民族人民的劳动观点。在牧区，对汉族劳动人民的某些隔阂状态已经大有改变，不少牧业合作社把过去雇用的汉人牧工，吸收成为合作社社员。过去牧区不愿意种树、盖房，怕汉人在牧区长期居住，现在牧区人民欢迎汉族劳动人民去牧区帮助打井，帮助种植饲料。蒙古族的农民和牧民对学习汉文、汉语，以便吸取汉族人民的先进经验的要求和热情，正在不断增长。民族间的互助有很大发展。在兴修水利运动中，土默特旗的毕克齐镇有一个规模较大的汉族农业社，看到附近一个规模较小的蒙古民族农业社存在劳力不足的困难，就决定派十个劳动力自带干粮帮助打井，两社之间，敲锣打鼓，欢迎、欢送，蒙汉民族间出现了社会主义民族关系的新气象。同时，生产大跃进运动也调动了最落后的阶层——宗教职业者。内蒙古全区有近两万喇嘛，现在除还有三千多人是住寺院不从事劳动生产以外，其他一万多人已经不同程度的参加了生产，有许多已经参加合作社，成了社员。有一个活佛要求办合作社，我们已经批准他办了。
  多快好省地发展工农牧业
    根据建设社会主义的总路线，我们已改订了自治区第二个五年计划期间工业、农业和牧业的发展规划。主要内容是，在农牧业方面五年完成十年规划的要求。到1962年全区平均达到亩产粮食四百斤，牲畜增至四千万头，森林采伐量达到年产八百四十万立方公尺，地方工业到1962年全区年产生铁一百万吨，钢六十万吨（包钢产量不包括在内），煤炭一千二百万吨。到那时候，内蒙古自治区地方工业将建立起七网，即：农牧业机械制造修配网，化肥生产供应网，动力网，煤炭供应网，农牧副产品加工制造网，交通运输网，邮电网。农牧业将基本上实现五化，就是：农田水利化，耕作机械化，农村、牧区电力化，肥料化学化，运输轴承化。到那时候，内蒙古自治区将成为全国钢铁工业基地之一，粮食基地之一，牲畜和畜产品基地之一，森林工业基地之一。为了实现这个规划，我们准备做好资源的综合利用，加紧建设山区、林区，开发矿产，充分发挥农牧业的潜在力量，合理调配劳动力与技术力量，认真贯彻工业和农业并举的方针，实现全党办工业、全民办工业，要求内蒙古办工业的同志树立起来为农牧业生产服务的观点，要求农村牧区旗县以上的党委要一手抓农牧业，一手抓工业。技术革命对内蒙古自治区有特殊重要意义，必须争取在三、五年内实现机械化，开展大规模的群众性的技术改革运动，并注意培养技术力量，以适应生产大跃进的需要。
    在牧业方面，我们正积极实现牧业社会主义改造，内蒙古自治区今年计划办一千个合作社，四十个公私合营牧场，这批合作社建成后，入社牧户将达到总牧户的50％或者更多一点。原来我们计划在三、五年内实现牧业合作化，现在来看大约有两年的时间就可以做到了。为保证畜牧业生产稳定发展，当前我们正集中力量解决水草问题。经验证明，有了合作社，再解决了水草问题，风雪灾害是不可怕的。内蒙古陈巴尔虎旗的互助合作基础较好，群众有打草储草的习惯，在历年的风雪灾害中，牲畜的死亡很少。巴林右旗有个拥有二百零六户牧户、一万二千头牲畜的牧业合作社，这个合作社叫“幸福之路”。他们搞了水利，建设了饲料基地，每头牲畜储备了五百斤草，一百斤料，牲畜已经基本上克服了“秋肥、冬瘦、春死”的不稳定局面，做到一年四季膘满肉肥，畜牧业稳定的发展起来了。这个社还搞了个水电站，点上了电灯。为了解决水草问题，我们已经抓紧了打井和利用牧区地面水源、打草和改良草原、建设饲料基地等三件事情。争取在三、五年内基本上消灭无水草原，解决牧区人畜供水和部分饲料基地的灌溉问题。我们已在牧区大力建设饲料基地，提倡每个社、每个组都种饲料，以群众为主，国营农牧场也大量种植。今年牧区已增建两个草原机器服务站，和三十个机械化育草站。
    结合农、林、牧业改造沙漠
    改造沙漠也是我们准备完成的一项历史任务。内蒙古境内沙漠约占十五万平方公里，占全区面积的十分之一。这些沙漠大部分在巴盟和伊盟牧区，一部分在农业区。沙漠给生产带来了很大困难，沙漠流动破坏了农田和牧场，阻断了交通，造成极大的灾害。如内蒙古西部沙漠、半沙漠区已经连续遭了两年旱灾，牲畜损失很大。最近一场春雨，下遍了农业区，但是沙漠、半沙漠区就没有下，或者是下的很少，至今那些牧区，牧草生长不起来，面临着连续第三个旱灾年的威胁。改造沙漠，只要几年时间就可收到巨大利益。据巴彦淖尔盟计算，种沙枣固沙，三、四年即可成林，一亩沙枣林产树叶、嫩枝、沙枣三千斤，用来养羊，可养两只。照此计算，改造一万平方公里沙漠，就可增加上千万头牲畜的牧场，利益是很大的。此外，沙漠、戈壁地区还有许多珍贵的矿藏，改造沙漠后，便利于这些矿产的开发。在改造沙漠工作上，我们已经掌握了一点情况，找到一些固沙植物。我们有个沙漠研究组，已经工作了一年多，对部分沙漠地区作了些调查研究。沙漠危害严重的是流动沙漠。流动沙漠与固定沙漠之间还有些绿洲。沙漠中有些地方缺水，有些地方有地下水。沙漠中已经发现许多适于生长的植物，如梭梭、沙蒿、山竹子、沙米（沙罗卜）、沙枣、臭柏、胡杨、沙柳、哈帽……等。在昭乌达盟、哲里木盟、伊克昭盟、巴彦淖尔盟，群众与沙漠已作了多年的斗争。哲、昭两盟已经营造防沙林和封沙育草、育林二十一万多公顷。磴口县的“幸福社”有三百七十九户人家，经过八年来的斗争，他们已经战胜了流沙。这里过去沙漠危害很大，三、四十年间，沙漠向东移动了三、四华里，干渠七次改道，二千五百亩良田被沙吞没。他们形容那时情况是：“沙漠无情压农田，逼得人家把家搬”。解放以后，他们组织起来治沙。他们总结了治沙的经验：“沙有一喜三怕，一喜是喜欢大风干旱，三怕是怕水、怕草、怕树”。他们采用打风障、封沙育草、造林防沙的办法来治沙，八年种了一百六十万棵树。现在已经基本上固定了80％的流沙，粮食大大增产，树林里养了成千只羊。他们形容现在的景况说：“东临黄河西面沙，育草造林好办法，八年经营黄龙伏，绿树丛中是人家”。为了改造沙漠，我们已经拟定了一个初步方案，并建立了改造沙漠的领导机构和科学研究所。方针是：改造沙漠与发展畜牧业相结合，与发展农业和林业相结合。由近及远，先易后难，小片沙漠依靠群众改造，大面积沙漠国家举办专业队并与群众的治沙相结合。方法是：封沙育草、营造防沙林带，引水灌沙，普遍散播防沙植物。人工固沙与机械固沙相结合。步骤是：先治流动半流动状态的十万平方公里面积的沙漠。要求七年基本固定危害农牧生产严重的流沙，十五年对大片沙漠的改造做出显著成绩。改造沙漠是一个艰巨任务，我们有决心动员全区人民并与各兄弟省区亲密协作配合，为实现这个任务而斗争。
  发展社会主义的民族关系
    在民族关系上，主要是发展新的社会主义的民族关系。为此，我们准备大力培养民族工人阶级，尤其是产业工人。在农业区大力提倡各民族人民间互教互学，着重发挥蒙古族和各少数民族的特长和提高他们的农业生产技术水平，在大跃进中使各族人民生活水平都能大体相适应的提高。在牧业区和游猎区帮助他们逐步定居，把畜牧业改造成为农牧结合的稳定发展的经济，把游猎经济改造成为农业、牧业、野兽养殖业和猎业相结合的经济。对于历史上遗留下来的某些必须照顾的问题，继续予以照顾。内蒙古的民族干部绝大多数都是在民主革命时期的两条路线斗争中，土地改革和牧区民主改革中，解放战争中，合作化运动中培养、提拔起来的，已经有一定的工作经验，在各种实际斗争中大多数表现很好。党组织也有了很大的发展，蒙古族党员有近三万人，其他少数民族的党员有三千五百人，牧区已经有四千一百多个党员和五百二十八个党的基层组织。但是，在整风、反右派斗争中，也出现了少数右派分子，暴露了不少干部还存在着资产阶级的个人主义的思想残余，在民族问题上还有许多糊涂观念，我们准备在整风的第四阶段，在干部中再普遍进行一次关于无产阶级立场、马列主义的世界观、马列主义民族观、党的群众路线的教育，并给予他们以实际工作和劳动的锻炼，使所有民族干部都在共产主义的原则下跃进一步。经过一个时期，使有无产阶级觉悟的、能够密切联系群众的共产主义化的民族干部大批成长起来。为了增进民族间的经济、文化的交流，我们准备在语言文字工作方面，做些改革工作，一方面在干部中和学校中提倡学蒙文、蒙语，并给予奖励，在某些专业部门和学校（例如在牧区工作的部门和学校），把学蒙文、蒙语定为必修的课程，适当增加分量。另一方面，在蒙古族的学校中，改变学制，用蒙文、蒙语教学的小学、中学，都延长学习年限一年到二年，学习汉文、汉语。我们准备继续在各族人民群众中，大张旗鼓的进行社会主义民族关系的教育，使民族团结互助成为在民族地区人民群众中的新的社会风气。对于宗教职业者，在贯彻执行党的宗教政策的原则下，将继续发动他们参加生产劳动，并对他们经常进行社会主义教育。
    实现全面大跃进的关键是加强党的领导，继续把全民整风运动进行到底，争取整风运动全胜。我们准备轮流抽调旗县委书记以上干部集中学习毛泽东同志的著作，改造思想，改变作风，把马列主义水平提高一步。我们内蒙古各级党的组织一定认真贯彻执行中央的指示，普遍推行种“试验田”的办法，使所有领导干部真正参加生产领导生产，深入群众领导群众，从中摸出一套政治与经济、政治与技术相结合的工作方法，使我们的工作人员真正做到“又红又专”，培养大批坚强的领导社会主义建设的骨干。我们要很好总结整风与生产密切结合互相促进的经验，今后办一切事业都要做到政治挂帅，使内蒙古自治区社会主义的改造和建设事业飞跃发展。
