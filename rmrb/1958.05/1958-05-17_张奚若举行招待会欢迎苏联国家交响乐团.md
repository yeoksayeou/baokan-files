Xinhua News Agency, 16th: Zhang Xiruo, Director of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, held a reception this evening to welcome all members of the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra.

　　At the beginning of the reception, Zhang Xiruo delivered a speech, saying that the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra's rich experience and superb playing skills, especially their hard-working, simple, united, and dedicated work style of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers, are worthy of good study by Chinese musicians. The orchestra has not only brought outstanding Soviet musical art to the Chinese people, but also given Chinese musicians a long-awaited learning opportunity.

　　Zhang Xiruo wished the Soviet artists' visit and performances would further deepen the mutual understanding between the Chinese and Soviet people and further consolidate the fraternal friendship between the two countries.

　　In his speech, conductor Anossov enthusiastically stated that the Soviet State Symphony Orchestra is the first symphony orchestra from Europe to perform in China, and every Soviet artist is very proud to have this opportunity. He also said that if our performance can promote the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction, it would be the greatest happiness for Soviet artists and would mean that they have completed their performance mission. He hoped that Soviet and Chinese musicians would work together for the development of socialist culture. Zhang Xiruo and Anossov both warmly congratulated the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite in their speeches.

　　Antononov, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in China, was invited to attend the reception.

　　At the reception, Xia Yan, Vice Minister of Culture; Ge Baoquan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association; Sudarikov, Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in China; and two musicians from the Soviet orchestra all spoke, unanimously congratulating the continuous development of cultural exchange and friendship between China and the Soviet Union.
