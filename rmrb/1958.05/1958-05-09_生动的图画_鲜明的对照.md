    Vivid Pictures, Sharp Contrasts
    By Our Correspondent Yang Yi
    During the enchanting early spring season in Czechoslovakia, I made a brief visit to Slovakia, toured the ancient city of Bratislava, and also visited an agricultural production cooperative about forty kilometers from the city.
    This is an old cooperative, with 280 member households and 1,300 hectares of farmland, supposedly of average production. Since its establishment, the cooperative's public property has increased more than threefold. Now the cooperative has 56 horses, more than 600 head of cattle, more than 1,300 pigs, and more than 2,000 chickens, as well as tractors, trucks, and small cars. More than 80% of the cooperative's agricultural labor is mechanized, and the entire village has been electrified.
    The members' lives are prosperous. I met an old member who now receives a pension of 270 crowns per month, and last year he earned 12,000 crowns and 2,500 kilograms of goods in kind. This cash and grain is enough to make his family live very comfortably, not to mention his considerable income from private plots and household sideline occupations.
    I also visited the home of a herdsman. The whole family consists of six people. He takes care of dairy cows and chickens. His father also takes care of horses in the cooperative. In addition to the old couple and the young couple, there are two lively and lovely children in the family. The whole family lives in six exquisite houses, including bedrooms, studies, living rooms, kitchens, and bathrooms. The room is furnished with spring beds, wardrobes, radios, oil paintings and antiques. The yard is very large. Dairy cows and piglets are raised in the cowshed and pigsty. Behind the yard is half a hectare (seven and a half mu) of private plots. The self-grown grapes alone can produce 600 to 1,000 liters of wine each year. The hosts enthusiastically offered us self-grown and self-brewed wine. The old host is already 65 years old. He participated in World War I and experienced the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the era of the bourgeois republic, and the enslavement of German fascists. He told us about the changes in people's lives before and after liberation. The old man said that people's lives were very poor in the past, but now they are very rich. At the same time, people's lives were not guaranteed in the past, and people who lived a little better also rose and fell from time to time. Now everyone's life is very stable, and there is no problem with food and clothing. The extra money is used to build houses, buy furniture or save it.
    On the train from Bratislava back to Prague, I gazed at the green fields and new buildings outside the window, watched the happy people around me, and thought about what the old man had said to me. The happy life of the Czechoslovak people is not an isolated or accidental phenomenon. In cities and villages, a wealthy standard of living can be seen everywhere. The lives of the Czechoslovak people today not only far exceed their previous times, but also surpass many advanced capitalist countries. This great achievement cannot but be attributed to the socialist system they established thirteen years ago.
    Ironclad facts and figures confirmed my thoughts.
    The premise of a prosperous people's livelihood is the growth of national income. From 1948 to 1956, Czechoslovakia's national income increased by nearly doubled, and last year it continued to increase by 7.4%. During this period, although capitalism was in a temporary "boom" period, the US national income increased by less than 40%, and the UK and France increased by only about one-third.
    In terms of per capita personal consumption, Czechoslovakia increased by one-half during this period, while the United States increased by only one-eighth. In 1937 before the war, the UK's personal consumption level was three-quarters higher than that of Czechoslovakia, but in twenty years, the UK only increased by 2.5%, and is now almost the same as Czechoslovakia. Even if it continues to develop at this rate, Czechoslovakia's consumption level will exceed that of the UK by 1960. It is worth pointing out that the UK's consumption level is still one of the highest in European capitalist countries.
    The Czechoslovak people eat an average of more than 48 kilograms of meat per person per year, which exceeds the level of West Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands, and Norway. The per capita consumption of sugar is 33.4 kilograms per year, which is more than France, West Germany, and Belgium. Czechoslovakia's consumption of eggs and flour is also higher than that of West Germany and Austria.
    The improvement of living standards is also marked by changes in the proportion of various expenses in the family. Taking food as an example, the sales volume of flour and black bread in Czechoslovakia is decreasing, while people's need for meat and dairy products is increasing. At the same time, the expenses of the working people's families for purchasing food are gradually decreasing, and the expenses for purchasing industrial products are gradually increasing. From 1953 to 1957, retail sales of food increased by only 32%, while retail sales of industrial products increased by 86%. In the family expenses of workers in Czechoslovakia, the main items are food, clothing, and furniture. Rent is very low, accounting for only 1.7% of household expenses. This is not the case in capitalist countries. For example, in the United States, rent accounts for 17.2% of workers' family expenses. Rent expenses in West Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and other countries are also higher than in Czechoslovakia. In addition, residents of capitalist countries also have to spend a lot of money on medical expenses and children's education expenses, which are all borne by the state in Czechoslovakia.
    In sharp contrast to the increasing unemployment, soaring prices, and declining incomes of the working people in capitalist countries is the prosperous life of the Czechoslovak people. The number of employed people in Czechoslovakia has been increasing every year. Last year, it increased by 130,000 compared with the previous year. Now the number of employed people is almost half of the country's population, and the proportion of women employed is far greater than that of the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. From 1948 to 1957, the average wage of workers in Czechoslovakia increased by about three-quarters.
    At present, the Czechoslovak people have a great demand for durable industrial products. For example, the sales volume of small cars in 1957 increased by more than doubled compared with the previous year, but there are still more than 50,000 people applying to buy cars. Czechoslovakia has been manufacturing television sets for less than five years, but the development has been extremely rapid. Calculated on a per capita basis, the number of television sets in Czechoslovakia today has exceeded those of Italy, Denmark, Norway, Austria, Switzerland, and Sweden.
    90% of the staff and workers and their families, who account for the Czechoslovak population, have the opportunity to enjoy national insurance benefits. In the forty-eight states of the United States, only the employees of the industrial and trade systems in four states can get partial, short-term sickness insurance money from the government. The huge subsidies provided by the Czechoslovak state to maternity and children are beyond the reach of any capitalist country. The elderly live a happy and peaceful life in Czechoslovakia. After retirement, they still receive most of their original wages on a monthly basis, and enjoy preferential treatment in housing and recuperation.
    The Czechoslovak government is extremely concerned about the health of the people. The funds allocated to health care each year account for 10% of the national budget, which is higher than the defense expenditure. This is unimaginable in capitalist countries. In Czechoslovakia, scarlet fever and diphtheria have almost disappeared. There is one doctor for every 684 residents in Czechoslovakia, ranking third in the world. There is one doctor for every 1,858 residents in the UK, and 745 and 976 residents in the US and France respectively.
    There are 570 college students per 100,000 people in Czechoslovakia, which is higher than any capitalist country. The number of primary and secondary school students, calculated on a per capita basis, also exceeds those of France, West Germany, Italy, Sweden, and Austria. In addition, there are 1,133 libraries for every 100,000 urban and rural residents in Czechoslovakia, while there are only 276 in Belgium, 302 in Denmark, and 812 in Finland. There is one cinema for every 3,000 people in Czechoslovakia, and each person watches movies an average of 14 times per year, which exceeds the level of France, Belgium, and Sweden.
    As I rummaged through the materials, which this short article cannot fully summarize, I did not feel the dryness of the numbers at all. What appeared before me were vivid pictures created by the Czechoslovak people under the leadership of the Communist Party, and clear contrasts. (Attached pictures)

    生动的图画　鲜明的对照
    本报记者　杨翊
    在捷克斯洛伐克迷人的早春时节，我去斯洛伐克作了一次短暂的访问，游览了古城布拉迪斯拉发，也参观了离城约四十公里的一个农业生产合作社。
    这是一个老社，有二百八十户社员和一千三百公顷农地，生产上据说属于中等。成立以来合作社的公共财产增加了三倍多。现在合作社有五十六匹马、六百多头牛、一千三百多口猪和两千多只鸡，还有拖拉机、载重汽车和小卧车。全社80％以上的农业劳动是使用机器的，全村业已电气化。
    社员的生活是富裕的。我遇见一个老社员，他现在每月领二百七十克朗的养老金，去年还挣得一万二千克朗和二千五百公斤实物，这些现款和粮食已足够使他一家生活得很舒适了，何况他还有数量不算小的自留地与家庭副业的收入。
    我也访问了一位饲养员的家庭，全家六口人，他照料乳牛和鸡群，父亲也在合作社看管马匹，除老俩口和小俩口外，家中还有两个活泼可爱的小孩。全家住着六间精致的房子，包括卧室、书房、客厅、厨房和浴室，室内陈设着弹簧床、衣柜、收音机、油画和古玩。院子很大，牛舍和猪栏里喂养着自己的乳牛和小猪，院后有半公顷（七亩半）自留地，单是自种的葡萄每年就能酿酒六百到一千公升。主人们热情地拿出自种自酿的葡萄酒款待我们。老主人已经六十五岁了，参加过第一次世界大战，经历了奥匈帝国的统治、资产阶级共和国的年代和德国法西斯的奴役。他向我们谈起解放前后人们生活的变化，老人说，过去人们生活很穷困，现在很富裕。同时，从前大家的生活没有保障，日子过得好一点的人也时起时落，现在大家生活很稳定，吃穿不成问题，多余的钱都用来修建房屋、购置家具或储蓄起来。
    在从布拉迪斯拉发回到布拉格的列车上，我凝望着窗外葱绿的原野和新建筑，注视着周围幸福的人群，思索着老人对我说过的一番话。捷克斯洛伐克人民的幸福生活并非个别或偶然现象，在城市和乡村，到处都可以看到富足的生活水平。捷克斯洛伐克人民今天的生活，不仅远远超出了他们以往的年代，而且也胜过了许多先进的资本主义国家。这一伟大成就的得来，不能不归功于他们十三年前建立起来的社会主义制度。
    铁一般的事实和数字证实了我的想法。
    人民生活富裕的前提是国民收入的增长。从1948年到1956年间，捷国民收入增长了近一倍，去年又续增7.4％。而这期间，尽管资本主义正处于暂时“景气”时期，但美国国民收入仅增加不到40％，英国和法国增加了也只不过约三分之一。
    在按人口计算的个人消费方面，这期间捷增长了二分之一，而美国仅增加八分之一。在战前的1937年，英国个人消费水平比捷高出四分之三，但二十年中，英国才增加2.5％，目前同捷已相差无几，即使按这一速度发展下去，到1960年时，捷消费水平即将超出英国。值得指出的是英国消费水平还是欧洲资本主义国家中最高的一个。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民每年每人平均吃肉四十八公斤多，超过了西德、意大利、瑞士、奥地利、荷兰和挪威的水平。每人每年消费糖三十三点四公斤，比法国、西德和比利时都多。鸡蛋和面粉的消费量捷也高于西德和奥地利。
    标志着生活水平提高的还有家庭中各项开支比例上的变化。以食品为例，捷面粉和黑面包的销售量在降低，人们对肉类和乳类产品的需要则在增加。与此同时，劳动人民家庭用于购买食物的费用逐步降低，用于购买工业品的费用逐步上升。从1953年到1957年间，食品零售额只增加32％，工业品零售额却增长了86％。在捷工人的家庭开支中，主要是食物、衣着、家具等项。房租很低，仅占家庭开支的1.7％。资本主义国家却不是这样。例如在美国，房租占工人家庭开支的17.2％。西德、瑞士、比利时、丹麦、挪威、瑞典等国的房租费用也都比捷克斯洛伐克高。此外，资本主义国家的居民还须花费很大一笔医药费和子女教养费，而这些在捷克斯洛伐克却是全部由国家担负的。
    同资本主义国家失业增加、物价飞涨和劳动人民收入下降成为鲜明对比的，是捷人民生活的欣欣向荣。捷就业人数每年都有增长，去年比前年又增加了十三万人，现在就业人数几乎达到全国人口的一半，妇女就业比例也远比美国、英国和法国为大。自1948年至1957年，捷工人平均工资增长了约四分之三。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克人民对耐用工业品的需求很大，如1957年小卧车的销售量比前一年增加了一倍多，但仍有五万多人在申请购车。捷制造电视机还不到五年，但发展异常迅速，按人口平均计算，捷今天的电视机数量已超过意大利、丹麦、挪威、奥地利、瑞士和瑞典这些国家。
    占捷人口90％的职工和他们的家属都有机会享受国家保险待遇，而在美国四十八州中，只有四州的工业和贸易系统职工能从政府得到部分的、短期的疾病保险金。捷国家对产妇和儿童的巨额补助是任何资本主义国家所望尘莫及的。老人们在捷克斯洛伐克过着幸福安静的生活，他们退休后仍按月领取原有工资的大部分，并在住宅、疗养等方面享受着惠优待遇。
    捷政府对人民健康极为关怀，每年为卫生事业拨付的经费占国家预算的10％，比国防费用要高，这在资本主义国家是不可想像的。在捷克斯洛伐克，猩红热和白喉几乎已经绝迹。捷六百八十四个居民中有一个医生，居世界第三位，英国一千八百五十八个居民才有一个医生，美国和法国分别是七百四十五人和九百七十六人。
    捷十万人中有五百七十个大学生，这数字比任何资本主义国家都高。中小学生的数目，如按人口平均计算，也超出了法国、西德、意大利、瑞典和奥地利等。此外，捷每十万城乡居民中有一千一百三十三个图书馆，而比利时只有二百七十六个，丹麦只有三百零二个，芬兰只有八百一十二个。捷每三千多人就有一个电影院，每人每年平均看电影十四次，超过了法国、比利时和瑞典等国的水平。
    我翻捡着远非这篇短文所能全部概括的材料，丝毫也没感觉到数字的枯燥，在我面前映现出的是捷克斯洛伐克人民在共产党领导下创造出的一幅幅生动的画图，一篇篇鲜明的对照。（附图片）
