    Every time I receive a new issue of "Children's Music," I stroke its beautiful cover a few times, preparing to open it, and I think: What fresh and interesting things will be in this issue? What lively songs and vivid texts? … And each time, it has not disappointed me. I think there must be many others who share my feelings.
    "Children's Music" was only founded this year, and now it has just completed five issues. It is so important to have a music journal for children; but in the past, there was not much experience. It is really commendable that it has been made into what it is now with so little experience.
    This publication first of all provides some high-quality songs, which are loved by children and have spread quickly. For example, "Let's All Celebrate" and "Listening to Mother Tell About the Past" in the first issue, "Embroidered Handkerchief" and "Wheat Sea" and "Careless Little Painter" in the second issue, "We Must Eliminate the Sparrows," "Nursery Song," and "This Year's Spring is Better Than in Previous Years" in the third issue, "Green Motherland," "Young Pioneer Tractor," and "Tree Planting Song" in the fourth and fifth issues… etc. Some of these songs are written by experienced writers, and some are written by authors we are less familiar with (I guess many of them must be engaged in children's music work); the themes of the works are also very broad and the styles are diversified, so that they can better meet the requirements of all aspects. In addition to this, I think there are two other points that are commendable: the first is that the editors pay attention to the needs of children of different ages, especially attaching importance to nursery rhymes, which writers often neglected in the past, and even published a special issue; the second is paying attention to selecting some folk songs suitable for children to sing. In the past, we felt very uncomfortable listening to children singing "Darling, you and I are of one heart," "Eighteen-year-old brother sits by the river"...following adults, so what should we use to replace it? "Children's Music" has begun to solve this problem.
    Instrumental music, performance songs, and small song and dance dramas also occupy a very important place in children's musical lives, and they also have their traditions; "Children's Music" has paid attention to this from the beginning, and has published some works of this kind in each issue. In particular, the special issue of children's song and dance dramas in the fourth and fifth issues provides four beautiful scripts such as "Three Butterflies," which all reflect some of the current thoughts and emotions of the children, and the music is also very pleasing… I think these are also one of the reasons why this small journal is welcomed by the majority of readers.
    The text part is also practical and lively. The music stories written by writer Chen Bochui and classical musician Zha Fuxi, and some introductions to the work experience of children's music are very satisfactory.
    It is not to say that this publication has no shortcomings, but here I am first praising this growing and dazzling little flower and would like to recommend it to everyone. Finally, I sincerely hope that this publication can become a strong position for carrying out communist ideological education for the nation's children.

### 一朵斑烂的小花：“儿童音乐”

　　一朵斑烂的小花：“儿童音乐”
　　马可
    每当我接到一期新的“儿童音乐”，将它漂亮的封面抚摩几下准备打开的时候，心里就想：这一期将有哪些新鲜有趣的东西？哪些活泼的歌曲和生动的文字？……而每次都没有使我失望。我想，和我怀有同感的人一定还有不少吧。
    “儿童音乐”是今年才创刊的，现在刚刚出满了五期。为孩子们办一个音乐期刊，这太重要了；但过去是没有很多经验的，在经验不多的基础上办成现在的样子，实在难能可贵。
    这个刊物首先是提供了一些质量较高的歌曲，这些歌曲为孩子们所喜爱，大都很快地流传开了。例如第一期的“我们大家来庆祝”、“听妈妈讲那过去的事情”，第二期的“绣手巾”、“麦海”、“粗心的小画家”，第三期的“要把那麻雀消灭光”、“苗圃之歌”、“今年的春天比往年更好”，第四、五期的“绿色的祖国”、“红领巾拖拉机”、“种树歌”……等等。这些歌，有的是出自有经验的作家之手，有的是我们比较陌生的作者写的（我猜想，他们之中一定有不少是从事儿童音乐工作的吧）；作品的题材也很广泛，风格多样化，这样就能够更好地满足各方面的要求。除此之外，我觉得还有两点是值得称道的：第一是编者注意各种不同年龄的孩子们的需要，特别是对过去作家们常常忽略的幼儿歌曲加以重视，甚至还出了一期专辑；第二是注意选了一些适合孩子们唱的民歌。过去我们听着孩子们跟着大人唱“郎呀，咱们俩是一条心”、“十八岁的哥哥坐在河边”……觉得很不舒服，那么究竟拿一些什么东西来代替它呢？“儿童音乐”已经开始解决这个问题。
    器乐、表演歌曲和小型歌舞剧在儿童的音乐生活中也占很重要的地位，并且也有它们的传统；“儿童音乐”在这方面一开始就注意到了，每期都发表了这一类的一些作品，特别第四、五期的儿童歌舞剧专号提供了“三只蝴蝶”等四个优美的脚本，它们都反映了孩子们当前的一些思想情绪，音乐也很中听……我想，这些也是使得这个小小的期刊获得广大读者欢迎的原因之一吧。
    文字部分也是实用而活泼的，作家陈伯吹和古典音乐家查阜西写的音乐故事和一些儿童音乐工作经验的介绍都很令人满意。
    并不是说这个刊物没有任何缺点，但这里我是首先赞美这朵茁长中的斑烂的小花，并愿向大家推荐。最后衷心希望这个刊物能够成为对全国少年儿童进行共产主义思想教育的一块坚强的阵地。
