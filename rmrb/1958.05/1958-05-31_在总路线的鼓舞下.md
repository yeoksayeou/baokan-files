Under the General Line's Inspiration

    New Contributions from Zhejiang Steel Plant
    In recent days, the Zhejiang Steel Plant's loudspeakers have repeatedly broadcast the resolutions and reports of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, bringing immense leaping forward power to the workers. They have overcome difficulties such as insufficient technical strength and poor conditions, and have increased smelting intensity and coke load, raising the output of the 82-cubic-meter-capacity blast furnace from 80 tons to over 100 tons, sometimes reaching 126 tons.
  
    New Scene at the Sanmenxia Construction Site
    Under the radiant light of the general line of socialist construction, the Sanmenxia construction site is showing a leaping forward scene everywhere. The dam is rising steadily, and production records are also rising steadily. The Feng Jurong Youth Shock Brigade, which is in charge of dam foundation excavation, overfulfilled its shift plan by 32.5% on the 25th with underwater drilling. The next day, the Wang Zen'ger group overfulfilled its shift plan by 50%. The "May Fourth" youth drilling and grouting team jumped from drilling 4.5 meters per shift to 10.98 meters on the 25th, setting a national record for grouting drilling.
  
    New Products from the Qiangsheng Movie Projector Factory
    In the low and narrow workshops of the Beijing Joint State-Private Qiangsheng Movie Projector Factory, the nights are as bright as day. The old workers wipe their sweat and say: "Work hard! The Party has issued a call to us workers." This small factory, located in two remote alleys, has two-thirds of its workers as apprentices, no engineers, and no technicians. However, all the employees dare to think and dare to do. Recently, inspired by the general line, they worked hard for four days and nights and successfully trial-produced stand fans (a type of electric fan) and half-horsepower small electric motors.
  
    New Targets for the Great Khingan Mountains Forest Area
    The 30,000 employees of the Great Khingan Mountains Forest Area have decided to widely launch the study and discussion of the documents of the Eighth National Congress, and implement them conscientiously. Since this spring, they have responded to the call of the Party Central Committee and exerted full effort, greatly leaping forward in timber production, completing 75% of the annual plan in less than five months. Now, inspired by the general line, they have put forward new leaping forward goals, to increase the national timber production by 900,000 to 1.1 million cubic meters for the whole year.
  
    Gutian Power Station to Generate Electricity Ahead of Schedule
    The builders of the Gutian Power Station, fighting on the banks of the Gutian River in Fujian, created a new record of 2,004.5 cubic meters of concrete poured per day the day after hearing the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. They want to shorten the construction time of the second phase of this hydropower station by one and a half years and generate electricity ahead of schedule in the first half of next year. While ensuring quality, they will save the country more than 10 million yuan.

    在总路线的鼓舞下
    浙江钢铁厂的新贡献
    这几天来，浙江钢铁厂的扩音器一再播送着八大二次会议的决议和报告，给工人们带来了巨大的跃进力量。他们克服了技术力量不足、条件不好的困难，提高了冶炼强度和焦炭负荷，使八十二立方公尺容量的高炉的产量从八十吨提高到一百吨以上，有时达到一百二十六吨。
  三门峡工地的新景象
    三门峡工地在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，到处呈现着跃进景象。大坝在节节高升，生产纪录也在节节高升。担任坝基开挖工作的风钻工冯巨荣青年突击队，在25日水下钻进超额32.5％完成了班计划。第二天王增尔小组又超额50％完成班计划。“五四”青年钻孔灌浆组25日由每班钻孔四点五公尺跃为十点九八公尺，创全国灌浆钻孔最高纪录。
  强声电影机厂的新产品
    北京市公私合营强声电影机厂低矮狭小的车间里，夜晚如同白天一样。老工人们一面擦着汗一面说：“干呀！党向我们工人发出号召了。”这个分设在两条偏僻的小胡同里的小工厂，三分之二的工人是徒工，没有工程师，没有技术人员。但是全厂职工敢想敢干，最近在总路线的鼓舞下，苦战四昼夜，试制成功了立扇（电风扇之一种）和二分之一马力小型电动机。
  大兴安岭林区的新指标
    大兴安岭林区的三万职工，决定广泛展开学习和讨论八大文件，并且认真执行。从今年春天到现在，他们响应党中央的号召，鼓足干劲，已经使木材生产有了很大跃进，不到五个月完成了全年计划75％。现在，在总路线的鼓舞下，他们又提出新的跃进目标，全年要给国家增产九十到一百一十万立方公尺木材。
  古田电站要提前发电
    战斗在福建古田溪畔的古田电站建设者们，在听到中共八大二次会议闭幕消息后的第二天，创造了
  日浇混凝土二千零四点五立方公尺的新纪录。他们要把这个水电站第二期工程建设时间缩短一年半，在明年上半年提前发电。在保证质量的前提下，为国家节约资金一千多万元。
