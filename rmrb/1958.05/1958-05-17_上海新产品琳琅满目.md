Shanghai's Dazzling Array of New Products

　　The shops in Shanghai are crowded with customers admiring all kinds of new products. The famous Xie Da Xiang silk and fabric store now adds five or six new fabric designs every day. One newly produced photo-engraved light floral fabric, printed with seven colors, features lifelike floral patterns. Many young women are buying it to make dresses and short-sleeved shirts.

　　This year's summer goods, which are on the market ahead of schedule, are new in design and high in quality. Undershirts and vests are generally lengthened by two centimeters, and some have ribbed hems, making them particularly comfortable to wear. In the State-owned No. 1 Department Store, there are more than thirty kinds of new-style sandals. People particularly like a type of microporous-soled sandal, which is light, durable, and elastic. Various department stores also have a soap containing a fluorescent whitening agent, which will make white clothes worn in summer even whiter. Sunscreen balm, specially for summer use, can protect the skin from sunburn in the hot summer sun, and will not melt, making it easy to carry.

　　Unbreakable enamel washbasins have aroused the interest of customers in many stores. Sometimes, at the request of customers, the salesperson drops the basin from the counter, and the enamel surface remains intact. There are also kettles that whistle when the water boils, and hammer-tone painted thermos flasks, which are all new products this year.

　　In various large and small department stores, people can buy Shanghai's new plastic products this year, including toothbrushes, combs, soap boxes, raincoats, handbags, and more, totaling more than twenty varieties. A fragrant plastic hair clip, clipped in the hair, has a fragrant smell, which is particularly loved by girls.

　　上海新产品琳琅满目
    在上海的商店里，各式各样的新商品前围满了顾客。著名的协大祥绸布商店，现在每天要增加五、六种新花样的布匹。有一种刚刚出厂的照像雕刻浅花布，用七种颜色套印，花型栩栩如生，许多姑娘买去缝制连衫裙和短袖衬衫。
    今年提前上市的夏令百货，花色新，质量高。汗衫、背心一般都加长了两公分，有的下摆采用了罗纹口，穿起来格外舒适。在国营第一百货商店里，新式的凉皮鞋有三十多种。人们特别喜爱一种微孔底凉鞋，轻柔耐磨，而且有弹性。各个百货店还有一种含有萤光增白剂的肥皂，用来洗涤夏天穿着的白色衣服，会使衣服更洁白。专供人们夏天搽用的防晒香脂，可以保护皮肤免受夏季烈日灼伤，而且不会融化，便于携带。
    不碎搪瓷汤盆，在许多商店里引起了顾客的兴趣。营业员有时应顾客的要求，把盆子从柜台上摔下来，盆面的搪瓷果然完好无损。还有水开时会叫的水壶、锤纹漆的旅行热水瓶等，都是今年的新产品。
    在各大小百货商店里，人们可以买到上海今年新制的塑胶商品，有牙刷、梳子、皂盒、雨衣、手提包等一共有二十多个品种。一种香花塑胶发夹，夹在头发上芬香扑鼻，女孩子们特别喜爱。
