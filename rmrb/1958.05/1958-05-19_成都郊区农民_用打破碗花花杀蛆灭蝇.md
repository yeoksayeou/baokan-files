Chengdu Suburban Farmers
Use *Anemone davidii* to Kill Maggots and Eliminate Flies

    (Our dispatch) Chengdu suburban farmers have launched a surge in collecting *Anemone davidii* to kill maggots and eliminate flies. In recent days, they have been using all available agricultural slack time to collect this valuable herb in large quantities from field ridges, ditch sides, and forests.

    In the past two weeks, according to extremely incomplete statistics, the number of people participating in the collection has reached more than 30,000, collecting a total of more than 43,000 *jin*.

    They use two methods. One is to chop the collected *Anemone davidii* finely with a knife and then put it into the manure pit. The other is to pound the *Anemone davidii* with a stick, spread it evenly on the upper layer of the manure, and then mix it with a bamboo pole. For manure pits with less than 500 *tiao*, about 10 *jin* is added; for manure pits with more than 500 *tiao*, 15 to 20 *jin* is added. According to experiments, *Anemone davidii* can kill two-thirds of the maggots in just two hours after being put into the manure pit, and all maggots can be killed in three hours.

    Farmer Peng Yuting said excitedly: "The government has so many great methods. Using it to kill maggots doesn't cost money, doesn't take effort, and is very effective."

　　成都郊区农民
　　用打破碗花花杀蛆灭蝇
    本报讯　成都郊区农民，已掀起采集打破碗花花杀蛆灭蝇的热潮。连日来，他们利用一切农闲时间，到田坎边、沟河旁、树林里去大量采集这种宝草。
    两周来，据极不完全的统计，参加采集人数已达三万多人，共采集四万三千多斤。
    他们使用的办法有两种，一是将采集的打破碗花花先用刀铡细后放入粪坑。另一种是将打破碗花花用棒捶烂后，均匀地铺在粪便上层再用竹竿搅混。五百挑以下的粪坑，放十斤左右，五百挑以上的粪坑放十五到二十斤。根据试验，打破碗花花放入粪坑后，只须二小时即可杀死三分之二的蛆虫，三小时即可将蛆虫全部杀死。
    农民彭玉庭兴奋地说：“政府的办法硬是多，用它来杀蛆，又不花钱，又不费事，又收效果”。
