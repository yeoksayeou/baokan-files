Notes

    A "Daily Express" of Britain on the 12th made an accounting: In the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, jointly funded by Western countries, the United States provided 30% of the capital, but 50% of the bank's loans are used to purchase American goods. Britain provided 12% of the capital, and only 12% of the bank's loans are used to purchase British goods. For this, the "Daily Express" expressed its resentment.

    The material provided by the "Daily Express" is useful because it once again shows how self-serving the United States is in dealing with its Western allies. However, the "Daily Express"'s complaint cannot help but make one think of another question: it is already very difficult for Britain to keep its capital in the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development without suffering a major loss; in today's increasingly declining British Empire, isn't it a dream to still want to profit from its partnership with the United States?

    小伙伴的怨气
    12日的英国“每日快报”算了一笔账：在西方国家合伙的国际复兴开发银行中，美国提供了30％的资本，但是这个银行的贷款的50％都是用来购买美国货物。英国提供了12％的资本，这个银行的贷款也只有12％用来购买英国货物。为此，“每日快报”表示不胜怨愤。
    “每日快报”提供的这个材料是有好处的，它又一次使人看到美国在同它的西方盟国相处中是何等的损人利己。不过，“每日快报”的抱怨却不能不使人想到另一个问题：英国在国际复兴开发银行中能保住本钱，不吃大亏，也就大不易了；在大英帝国日益衰落的今天，还想在同美国的合伙中占便宜，不是梦想吗？
