Xinhua News Agency, 9th Dispatch: TASS reports: The Soviet government issued a statement on the 8th, once again calling on the U.S. government to listen to reason, reconsider its position, and cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

The statement said that the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of atomic and hydrogen weapon tests created favorable conditions for a complete and universal solution to the problem of stopping nuclear weapon tests. Now, whether nuclear weapon testing can be stopped worldwide depends solely on the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom.

Regrettably, the position and actions taken by the U.S. and British governments on this issue demonstrate that they are unwilling to facilitate the cessation of the nuclear arms race. The U.S. government has openly stated that it does not intend to abandon its policy of further intensifying the nuclear arms race and is seeking various excuses to continue testing this type of weapon. The statement pointed out that the U.S. government, as well as the British government, recently conducted atomic weapon tests and hydrogen bomb explosions. This practice cannot but arouse the condemnation of everyone who strives to free humanity from the threat of atomic war.

In the statement, the Soviet government stated that it cannot accept the U.S. government's proposal to send Soviet scientists and journalists to observe U.S. nuclear bomb explosions. The statement said that the Soviet Union cannot participate in, and will never participate in, activities that run counter to the principled position of the Soviet Union's announced unilateral cessation of nuclear weapon tests. The Soviet Union believes that taking such a step would actually mean embarking on the path of encouraging the nuclear arms race policy, thereby bearing no small responsibility before the people of all countries for this action.

The statement pointed out that the U.S. suggestion through the United Nations that member states of the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation send observers to observe U.S. nuclear weapon tests shows that the U.S. government is attempting to use the prestige of the United Nations to achieve goals that violate the security interests of the people of all countries, and wants to make the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation an accomplice in U.S. testing of new atomic and hydrogen bombs.

It is not difficult to see that the plan to openly explode new nuclear bombs in front of observers from the United Nations Scientific Committee, as well as the vigorous clamor surrounding the so-called "clean" hydrogen bomb, conceals the intention of attempting to create the illusion, regardless of scientists' warnings, that nuclear weapon tests do not seem to endanger human health and life, so they can continue to be tested.

    为了使人类摆脱原子战争的威胁
    苏联再次呼吁美国停试氢弹
    表示不能派科学家观察美国核爆炸
    新华社9日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联政府在8日发表声明，再一次呼吁美国政府倾听理智的声音，重新考虑自己的立场，不要再进行原子武器和氢武器试验。
    声明说，苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验为彻底和普遍解决停止核武器试验问题创造了良好的条件。现在，在全世界范围内能否停止核武器试验就只取决于美国和英国政府了。
    遗憾的是，美英两国政府在这个问题上采取的立场和它们的行动证明，它们不愿意促成停止核军备竞赛。美国政府公开表示它不打算放弃进一步加剧核军备竞赛的方针，并且在为继续试验这种武器寻找种种借口。声明指出，美国政府以及英国政府最近又进行了原子武器试验和氢弹爆炸。这种做法不能不引起每个力求使人类摆脱原子战争威胁的人的谴责。
    苏联政府在声明中表示，它不能接受美国政府提出的关于派遣苏联科学家和新闻记者去观察美国核弹爆炸的建议。声明说，苏联不可能参与、而且也决不会参与目的同苏联宣布单方面停止核武器试验的原则性立场背道而驰的活动。苏联认为，如果采取这种步骤，实际上意味着走上鼓励核军备竞赛政策的道路，从而要在各国人民面前对这种行动负不小的责任。
    声明指出，美国通过联合国建议联合国原子能辐射影响科学委员会会员国派遣观察员观察美国核武器试验的建议表明，美国政府企图利用联合国的威信来达到违反各国人民安全利益的目的，并想使联合国原子能辐射影响科学委员会成为美国试验新式原子弹和氢弹的同谋者。
    不难看出，在联合国科学委员会观察员面前公开爆炸新式核弹的计划，以及围绕着所谓“干净”氢弹而大肆进行叫嚣，掩盖着这样一种打算：企图不顾科学家的警告而造成一种假象，使人认为核武器试验似乎不会危害人类的健康和生命，所以也就可以继续试验。
