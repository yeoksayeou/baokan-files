　　Beautiful Farmer's Park
    The two farmer's parks located in Baidun Township, Xianning County, Hubei Province, are both situated on quiet hillsides surrounded by mountains, with shady trees and lush flowers and plants. The parks are also equipped with elegant pavilions and stone tables and stools. As the sun sets, commune members who have worked all day come here in groups of twos and threes to engage in various lighthearted recreational activities. During festivals, people flock here even more, sometimes holding small celebrations and discussion meetings to celebrate the holidays.

　　美丽的农民公园
    两个设在湖北省咸宁县柏墩乡的农民公园，都设在四面环山的幽静的小山坡上，境内树木成荫，花草繁茂。公园内还设有雅致的小亭和石制的小桌凳。每当夕阳西下的时候，劳动了一天的社员们三五成群地来到这里，进行各种轻快的娱乐活动。每逢节日，人们更是络绎不绝地来到这里，有时还在这里举行小型的庆祝会、谈话会，欢度节日。
