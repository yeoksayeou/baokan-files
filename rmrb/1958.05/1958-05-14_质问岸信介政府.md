　　Questioning the Kishi Nobusuke Government

　　Editor's Note: The Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan's despicable acts of undermining the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and condoning thugs insulting our national flag have aroused great indignation among the people of our country. Our newspaper has received a large number of letters from people from all walks of life across the country, making solemn condemnations and protests against the Kishi Nobusuke government. We now publish excerpts of some of the letters below:

　　Yang Nianhai, a worker from the turbine workshop of Dalian Shipyard, said: The Kishi Nobusuke government condoned thugs insulting our national flag, which is an insult to the 600 million Chinese people, and we will never tolerate it. In recent years, we have seen the continuous friendly exchanges between the Japanese people and our people, which is in the interests of both peoples. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, disregarding the interests of the Japanese people, has consistently been hostile to our country. We want to warn the Kishi Nobusuke government: The great Chinese people who have stood up cannot tolerate bullying; your imperialist attitude of treating old China in the past can no longer frighten the new Chinese people. If you overestimate yourself and insist on being hostile to the Chinese people, you will only be asking for trouble.

　　Zhang Youqing, a naval soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, said: The Kishi Nobusuke government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement and condone thugs insulting our national flag has made our people's soldiers defending the motherland's sea defense extremely indignant. We Chinese people hope to develop friendly relations with the Japanese people, but we cannot remain silent about the Kishi Nobusuke government's behavior of hostility towards the Chinese people. The dignity of the People's Republic of China must not be insulted.

　　Yu Chenglin of the Ship Registration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications said: The Kishi Nobusuke government's sabotage and interference in the exchanges between Sino-Japanese non-governmental organizations is by no means accidental, and it is inextricably linked to its policy of following the United States. I believe that this small group of latent Japanese imperialist elements who are implementing pro-American reactionary policies will inevitably be abandoned by the Japanese people.

　　Dong Xiuzhi and Hu Xuandai of the China National Import and Export Corporation said: We were very angry when we saw the news that Kishi Nobusuke condoned thugs insulting our national flag. We angrily protest this provocative behavior and firmly demand that the Kishi Nobusuke government arrest and bring the thugs to justice. China is no longer the China of the past. If Kishi Nobusuke dreams of treating the new China with the old militarist attitude, then he is wrong.

　　The entire class of Class 554 of Beijing Petroleum Institute wrote: The Kishi Nobusuke government's shameless submission to the United States and its consistent hostility towards the Chinese people is intolerable. We warn the Kishi Nobusuke government that the dignity of our country must not be arbitrarily insulted by anyone! The Kishi Nobusuke government must bring the thugs to justice, publicly apologize to our country, and guarantee that similar hostile acts will not occur in the future.

　　质问岸信介政府
    编者按　日本岸信介政府破坏第四次中日贸易协定、纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗的卑劣行为，已经激起了我国人民的极大愤慨。本报收到全国各地各界人民的大批来信，对岸信介政府提出严正谴责和抗议。现将部分来信摘要发表如下：
    大连造船厂轮机车间工人杨念海说：岸信介政府纵容暴徒侮辱了我国国旗，这是对六亿中国人民的侮辱，我们决不能容忍。几年来，我们看到日本人民和我国人民不断进行友好往来，这是符合两国人民利益的。但是，岸信介政府却不顾日本人民利益，一贯敌视我国。我们要警告岸信介政府：站起来了的伟大的中国人民是不能容忍欺侮的；你们那种过去对待旧中国的帝国主义态度，再不能吓唬新中国人民了。如果不自量力，硬要敌视中国人民，那只会是自讨苦吃。
    中国人民解放军海军战士张友清说：岸信介政府勾结蒋介石集团破坏中日渔业协定、纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗的事件，使我们保卫祖国海防的人民战士愤慨万分。我们中国人民希望同日本人民发展友好关系，但对岸信介政府这种敌视中国人民的行为，决不能保持沉默。中华人民共和国的尊严绝不容侮辱。
    交通部船舶登记局俞成麟说：岸信介政府对中日两国民间团体的往来进行破坏和干涉，决不是偶然的，这同它追随美国的政策有不可分割的关系。我相信：执行亲美的反动政策的这一小撮潜在的日本帝国主义分子，必然会遭到日本人民的唾弃。
    中国进出口公司董秀芝、胡煊代说：看到岸信介纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗的消息后，我们非常气愤。我们愤怒抗议这种挑衅行为，并坚决要求岸信介政府将暴徒逮捕法办。中国已不是旧日的中国了，如果岸信介梦想以旧日的军国主义态度对待新中国，那他就打算错了。
    北京石油学院第554班全体同学来信说：岸信介政府厚颜无耻地屈从美国，一贯敌视中国人民的行为，令人忍无可忍。我们警告岸信介政府，我国的尊严绝不许任何人肆意侮辱！岸信介政府必须法办暴徒，公开向我国道歉，并保证今后不再有类似敌视行为发生。
