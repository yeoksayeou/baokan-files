Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 25th. The news of the victorious closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has brought tremendous inspiration and strength to the people of Shanghai, who are in the midst of the Great Leap Forward. The five Shanghai newspapers that published the closing news of the conference printed more than 50,000 additional copies today, all of which were sold out. Many cadres carefully read the closing news, and some factories' reading groups also organized discussions.

    The head of the county-level model nitrogen fertilizer plant, which went into production half a month ago during the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, told reporters after reading today's newspaper that the county-level model nitrogen fertilizer plant was built under the brilliant light of the general line of socialist construction. It provides experience for building small nitrogen fertilizer plants quickly, well, and economically throughout the country, and specifically embodies the principle of giving equal importance to industry and agriculture, central and local industries, and large, medium, and small enterprises.

    Before and after the plant started operation, representatives from most provinces and cities across the country came to visit and learn, preparing to build large numbers of them locally. Now, the plant's designers are continuing to revise the finalized design drawings of the county-level nitrogen fertilizer plant based on the production situation, so that this design is more in line with the spirit of the general line; at the same time, they are actively preparing to run training classes to train plant construction cadres for various provinces and cities.

    This morning, the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant quickly held a cadre meeting and decided to complete the trial production of the basic model of a series of cylindrical grinding machines, originally scheduled to be completed by the end of the year, before National Day, as an important action for the plant to implement the general line. Ai Ding, the plant director, told reporters enthusiastically today: "We are a specialized grinding machine factory. Our production of grinding machines and increased variety provides better conditions for the technological revolution of other industrial sectors. The value of our factory's output this year will double that of last year, and the number of new products trial-produced will be 40, five times that of last year. Some of these are cutting-edge products that climb to the peak of world grinding machine technology. Since the beginning of this year, ten new products have been successfully trial-produced, two more than the entire last year. Our goal is to strive to ensure that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the variety of grinding machines produced can basically meet the needs of all sectors of the national economy, and the output will increase by one to two times more than this year's Great Leap Forward plan. These are our specific action programs to implement the general line and build socialism at the highest speed."

    The Shanghai No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant, the first iron and steel joint enterprise under construction in Shanghai, was on holiday today, but Chen Lin, the factory's Party Committee Secretary, encouraged by the general line, arrived at the factory early in the morning to study with the workshop director the proposal put forward by the steelmaking workers to reform the open-hearth furnace operation method, extending the life of the open-hearth furnace from 450 heats to 800 heats. Chen Lin said: "Today, the Party has put forward a new call to battle. We must accelerate all our work so that the two blast furnaces, two converters, and seamless steel pipe workshops under construction can be put into production as soon as possible. The annual steel output of the entire plant will rapidly leap from the current 370,000 tons to 1 million tons."

    Zhou Ren, Director of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and member of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Academy of Sciences, carefully read the news of the victorious closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. He was very excited about the general line of socialist construction put forward at the meeting, especially the tasks of technological revolution and cultural revolution. Zhou Ren was very happy to introduce to reporters how the Great Leap Forward in production has promoted the Great Leap Forward in the research work of the Institute of Metallurgy and Ceramics. This scientific research unit has broken with convention and established two-shift and three-shift systems. Many important experimental studies closely related to the current Great Leap Forward in production are being carried out intensively. Zhou Ren said that the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture has given us unlimited confidence, and the call for scientific research to serve the Great Leap Forward in production has pointed out the direction for us. I believe that after scientists thoroughly criticize bourgeois individualism and the idea of science for science's sake, a truly Great Leap Forward in scientific experiments will soon arrive.

### 新的战斗号召鼓舞了上海人民  用最高速度建设社会主义

    社会主义建设总路线光芒万丈
    新的战斗号召鼓舞了上海人民
    用最高速度建设社会主义
    新华社上海25日电　中共八大二次会议胜利闭幕的消息，给正在大跃进中的上海人民带来了巨大的鼓舞和力量。刊登着会议闭幕消息的上海市五家报纸，今天增印了五万多份，全部售完。许多干部仔细阅读了闭幕消息，有的工厂的读报组还组织了讨论。
    半个月前正当中共八大二次会议开会期间投入生产的县级示范性氮肥厂的负责人看了今天的报纸后对记者说，县级示范性氮肥厂就是在社会主义建设总路线光芒的照耀下建成的。它为全国各地多快好省地兴建小型氮肥厂提供了经验，具体地体现了工农业并举、中央工业和地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举的方针。
    在这个厂开工的前后，全国大部分省、市都派代表来参观学习，准备在当地大量兴建。现在厂里的设计人员正在根据生产的情况，继续修改县级氮肥厂的定型设计图纸，使这一设计更加符合总路线的精神；同时积极筹备开办训练班，为各省市培养建厂干部。
    上海机床厂今天上午赶紧举行了干部会议，决定把原定年底完成的一个外圆磨床系列产品基本型号的试制工作，提前在国庆节前完成，作为这个厂贯彻总路线的一个重要行动。厂长艾丁今天热情地对记者说：“我们是一个专业磨床工厂，我们生产磨床，增多品种，就是为其他工业部门进行技术革命提供更好的条件。我们工厂今年的产值要比去年增加一倍，试制的新产品共有四十种，等于去年的五倍，其中有几种是攀登世界磨床技术高峰的尖端产品。今年以来已经试制成功十种新产品，比去年全年还要多两种。我们的目标是争取到第二个五年计划期末，出产的磨床的品种基本上可以满足国民经济各部门的需要，产量比今年的跃进计划再增加一到二倍。这些就是我们贯彻总路线，以最高速度建设社会主义的具体行动纲领。”
    建设中的上海第一个钢铁联合企业——上海第一钢铁厂，今天虽然是休假日，工厂党委书记陈林在总路线的鼓舞下，一清早就赶到厂里，和车间主任研究尽快推广炼钢工人所提出的改革平炉操作方法，使平炉炉龄由四百五十炉延长到八百炉的建议。陈林说：“今天党又提出了新的战斗号召，我们各项工作都要加速进行，使正在兴建的二个高炉、两个转炉和无缝钢管车间尽快地投入生产，全厂年产钢量将由目前的三十七万吨迅速跃进到一百万吨”。
    中国科学院冶金陶瓷研究所所长、科学院技术科学部委员周仁详细地阅读了中共八大二次会议胜利闭幕的消息，他对这个会上提出的社会主义建设的总路线，特别是技术革命、文化革命的任务感到非常兴奋。周仁很高兴地向记者介绍了生产大跃进如何推动冶金陶瓷研究所研究工作大跃进的情况。这个科学研究单位，已经打破常规，建立了两班制和三班制，不少密切配合当前生产大跃进的重要的试验研究正在紧张进行。周仁说，工农业大跃进给了我们无限的信心，科学研究为生产大跃进服务的号召给我们指明了方向。我相信，在科学家们彻底批判了资产阶级个人主义和为科学而科学的思想以后，科学试验上真正大跃进的局面马上就要到来。
