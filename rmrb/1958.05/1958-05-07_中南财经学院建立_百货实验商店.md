Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 6th. The department store laboratory established by Zhongnan University of Finance and Economics began operations on the 4th. This is a measure taken by the university to implement work-study programs and combine theory with practice.

In the past, the Department of Trade Economics at the university had poor integration of theory and practice in its teaching. The internship content for graduating students was limited to visits or sporadic operations. After the establishment of this department store laboratory, it has become a venue for students to take turns conducting thematic internships. Students, in conjunction with major courses such as "Business Research," "Trade Organization and Technology," and "Commodity Science," will acquire more systematic practical knowledge through internships in the store.

According to the person in charge of Zhongnan University of Finance and Economics, other departments of the university, such as the Accounting Department and the Industrial Economics Department, are also planning to open accounting tutorial schools and artificial fiber workshops in order to cultivate students' labor viewpoints and mass viewpoints, so that they can become both red and expert talents.

    中南财经学院建立
    百货实验商店
    新华社武汉6日电　中南财经学院建立的百货实验商店，4日开始营业了。这是这个学院实行勤工俭学、使理论与实际相结合的一项措施。
    这个学院的贸易经济系，过去教学中理论与实际结合得差，毕业班学生的实习内容仅限于参观访问或零星操作。这个百货实验商店建立后，就成为学生们轮流进行专题实习的场地。学生结合“商情研究”、“贸易组织与技术”、“商品学”等主要课程，通过商店的实习，将取得较系统的实际知识。
    据中南财经学院负责人谈，学院其他系如会计系、工业经济系也正在计划开办会计补习学校、人造纤维作坊，以便培养学生的劳动观点和群众观点，使他们成为又红又专的人才。
