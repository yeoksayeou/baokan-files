Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 28th. The general line for socialist construction formulated at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China has brought tremendous encouragement and strength to the workers and staff of local industrial factories and mines in Chongqing. Many workers believe, from their own experiences, that as long as they greatly liberate their minds and break down the mysterious view of running industry and mastering science and technology, they can accelerate the development of local industry. They expressed their intention to more actively implement the general line.

The workers of the Chongqing Musical Instrument Factory held a meeting today to discuss their preliminary understanding of studying the general line. Guan Zengli, a technician who has worked in the factory for a long time, said that more than six years ago, our factory had only one broken machine tool, a few files, and five workers. From technicians to workers, no one understood or had studied the technology of making accordions. However, thanks to the bold attempts and research of all the workers in the factory, in just over six years, our factory has developed into the largest accordion manufacturing factory in the country, producing the nationally famous Yangtze River brand accordion. Originally, our leap forward plan was that the quality of the accordion would not catch up with the world's best Italian "Soprani" accordion until 1962. However, everyone went all out and repeatedly revised the leap forward plan. Now it has been decided that by July 1st this year, all quality indicators will catch up with "Soprani."

Engineers, workshop directors, and members of the youth shock brigade of the Chongqing Stationery Factory, today discussed the new requirements put forward by the cultural revolution for the industrial sector at a symposium. Engineer Wang Yue Rui said that the cultural revolution requires us to produce more and better high-end cultural products, which is a great encouragement to all the workers in our factory. Our first goal is to make the main products, ink and fountain pens, catch up with the American Parker ink and Parker pens. The Chongqing Stationery Factory is a very ordinary small factory in Chongqing. Half a year ago, the fountain pens and ink produced by the factory were not very popular in the market. But now, the "Hongyan" (Red Rock) premium ink produced by the factory is of better quality than the best American "51" ink. Now they have proposed to successfully trial-produce the "Hongyan" premium gold pen before July 1st this year, to catch up with the American Parker. (Attached picture)

Chongqing's local industrial products have seen a "blooming" situation. The quality of the Yangtze River brand accordion is catching up rapidly with Italy, and the alarm clock produced by the Jialing Machine Factory has ascended to the top spot in the country. Hongyan (Red Rock) brand premium ink has reached and surpassed the American "51" and "21" Parker ink. High-precision pocket watches, "Sputnik" brand watches, and new types of cameras have all been successfully trial-produced recently. Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Shilin.

    厂小技术高　产品赛美国
    重庆地方工业职工大破办工业的神秘观点
    新华社重庆28日电　中共八大二次会议制订的社会主义建设总路线，给重庆市地方工业厂矿职工带来了极大的鼓舞和力量。许多职工从他们的切身体会中认为，只要思想大解放、打破对办工业和掌握科学技术的神秘观点，就能加速地方工业的发展。他们表示要更积极地贯彻总路线。
    重庆乐器厂职工今天集会座谈了学习总路线的初步体会。很早就在这个厂工作的技术人员关增立说，我们厂在六年多前只有一部破机床、几把锉刀和五个工人，从技术人员到工人没有一个懂得和学过制造手风琴的技术。但是，由于全厂职工大胆尝试钻研，仅仅六年多就使我们的厂发展成为全国最大的生产手风琴的工厂，制造出了全国驰名的长江牌手风琴。原来我们制订的跃进规划，手风琴的质量要1962年才能赶上世界上最好的意大利“索布拉尼”手风琴，可是大家鼓足了干劲，一再修改跃进计划，现在决定在今年“七一”各项质量指标就要赶上“索布拉尼”。
    重庆文具制造厂工程师、车间主任和青年突击队队员们，今天在座谈会中谈到了文化革命对工业部门提出的新要求。工程师王曰睿说文化革命要求我们生产更多更好的高级文化用品，这对我们全厂职工的鼓舞很大。我们第一步的目标是使主要产品墨水和自来水笔赶上美国的派克墨水和派克笔。重庆文具制造厂是重庆市很普通的一个小厂，半年前厂里生产的自来水笔和墨水在市场上还不大受欢迎。但是现在厂里生产的“红岩”高级墨水却比美国最好的“五一”墨水质量还要好。现在他们又提出在今年“七一”前试制成功“红岩”高级金笔赶上美国的派克。（附图片）
    重庆市地方工业产品出现了“百花齐放”的局面。长江牌手风琴的质量猛追意大利，嘉陵机器厂出产的闹钟登上全国第一的宝座。红岩牌高级墨水达到和超过美国的“五一”和“二一”派克墨水。精密度要求很好的挂表、“人造卫星”牌手表和新型的照相机，都在最近试制出来。　新华社记者　刘诗临摄
