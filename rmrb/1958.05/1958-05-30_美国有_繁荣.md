　　The U.S. Has "Prosperity"

　　Not long ago, "U.S. News & World Report" reported on a new situation in U.S. military recruitment: "Thousands of unemployed people are heading to recruitment offices. In the first two months of 1958, Army enlistments jumped 22.5% from a year earlier, Navy enlistments jumped 27%, and Marine Corps enlistments rose 6.3%."

　　This American newspaper seemed to think this was something to be thankful for, saying, "The economic recession has brought prosperity to the armed forces in at least one respect..."

　　The reality in the United States is this: people engaged in production are unemployed in large numbers and have nowhere to turn; however, the non-productive U.S. military, as a tool of aggressive policy, opens its doors wide, welcoming all comers, the more the better. In short, in the United States, it is always the working people who suffer: the disaster of "recession" falls on them first, and the so-called "prosperity" comes from their pain and sacrifice.

### 美国有“繁荣”

    美国有“繁荣”
    不久前，“美国新闻与世界报道”报道了美国招兵工作中出现的新情况，“成千的失业者正走向招兵处。1958年头两个月里，陆军入伍人数比一年前跃升了22.5％，海军入伍人数跃升27％，陆战队上升6.3％”。
    这家美国报纸对此似乎还很认为值得庆幸，它说：“经济衰退至少在一个方面为武装部带来了繁荣……”。
    美国的现实就是这样：从事生产的人，大批失业，走投无路；但是，作为侵略政策工具的非生产性质的美国军队，则是敞开大门，来者不拒，多多益善。总之，在美国，倒霉的总是劳动人民：“衰退”的灾难首先落在他们身上，而所谓“繁荣”也是由他们的痛苦和牺牲而得来的。
