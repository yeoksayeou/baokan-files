    Reforming Wheat Harvesting Tools
    After a debate on the major reform of wheat harvesting tools by the farmers of Hengcun Township in Huaxian County, Henan Province, all townships are actively reforming wheat harvesting tools to improve production efficiency.
    At the recent summer harvest work conference held by the Hengcun Township Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, a special forum was held to discuss how to reform wheat harvesting tools—to make them lighter to use and more efficient. Everyone agreed that before the wheat harvest, they should manufacture push-type sickle harvesters, double-headed shovels, and transform transportation vehicles and rubber-wheeled carts to double the efficiency of wheat harvesting.
    After the debate, a friendly competition of "comparing inventions, comparing creations, comparing reforms, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, and seeing which township is better prepared" was launched among the agricultural cooperatives throughout the township. Within three days, the townships throughout the township had manufactured 476 new summer harvest and planting tools, such as harvesters. At the same time, delivering manure to the fields and early autumn field management before wheat harvest are also progressing well.

    改革麦收工具
    河南滑县横村乡农民在进行麦收工具大改造的辩论之后，全乡各社都在为提高生产效率，积极地改革收麦工具。
    在中共横村乡委员会最近召开的布置夏收工作会议上，对如何改革麦收工具——使麦收工具用着轻便、效率高，进行了专题鸣放辩论。大家一致意见，要在麦收前制造人推剪刀式收割机、双头铲，改造运输大车、胶轮小推车，使麦收效率提高一倍。
    辩论后，全乡各农业社与农业社之间掀起了一个“比发明、比创造、比改革、比多快好省，看那个社准备得妥善”的“四比一看”的友谊竞赛。全乡各社在三天内已制造收割机等夏收夏种新工具四百七十六件。与此同时，地头送粪、麦前早秋田间管理也进行的很好。
