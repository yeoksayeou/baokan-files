Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Soviet Professor Alipert told TASS reporters that the Soviet Union's third artificial earth satellite's plan to study the upper atmosphere is unprecedented in terms of the scale of the experiment. Four of the eight scientific studies to be carried out on this satellite are directly related to the outer layers of the ionosphere. The data obtained from the third satellite on the composition and processes of the ionosphere will help solve many important problems in physics, geophysics, and astrophysics.

Professor Alipert said that the third satellite can provide information on the structure of the ionosphere from five aspects. In addition to measuring the pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, the concentration of positive ions, the intensity of solar corpuscular radiation, and the intensity of the Earth's magnetic field, observations of the satellite's radio signals can also provide valuable data in this regard. The most important feature of the above experiments is that the same numerical value (such as electron concentration) is studied simultaneously using several methods. This will ensure the greatest accuracy of the research results.

Alipert continued, as everyone knows, the basic components of the atmosphere in the satellite's orbit (above 1,000 kilometers) are electrons, neutrons in gases, and positive ions. Based on the observation data of the first artificial satellite, the wave height of these particles in the high altitude within 600 to 700 kilometers has been determined. Through special calculations, the concentration values of these particles at an altitude of 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers have also been obtained. Here, there are less than one neutron, 200 to 2,000 electrons and positive ions per cubic centimeter. The instruments on the third satellite can verify and further confirm these figures.

The satellite is equipped with a specially structured magnetometer, which can accurately measure the direction and intensity of the Earth's magnetic field vector. The Earth's magnetic field causes very interesting physical effects: a radio wave is divided into two radio waves of different frequencies under its action. By comparing these frequencies, the electron concentration value in the entire ionosphere can be calculated quite accurately.

Up to now, the chemical composition of the upper atmosphere is virtually unknown. It is generally believed that the basic gases there are oxygen and nitrogen atoms. However, this is not entirely true. These gases can also be in a molecular state. In addition, there is a certain amount of hydrogen there. The instruments on the satellite can not only accurately record the existence of these gases, but also record the specific gravity of each gas in the upper atmosphere. Data on the chemical composition of the upper atmosphere can be used to study the microscopic processes therein - the ionization process and the recombination process of electrons with positive ions. This will enable the establishment of a theory for the formation of the ionosphere.

A series of phenomena in the upper atmosphere - ionospheric magnetic storms, the formation of ionization clouds, appear to be related to the effects of solar particle radiation. The third satellite can measure the energy and quantitative composition of solar particle streams, making it possible to study the degree and nature of solar particle effects on the ionosphere.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 20th - Why do magnetic anomaly phenomena occur in some places on Earth where there are no mineral deposits that cause magnetic anomalies? This problem, which the scientific community has not yet solved, is expected to be solved by the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite.

This was said by Garinin, head of the Geomagnetic Working Group of the Soviet International Geophysical Year Committee, in an interview with "Labor Daily."

Garinin pointed out that there are many magnetic anomaly zones on Earth. Some of these are caused by underground mineral deposits. For example, the famous Kursk magnetic anomaly zone is caused by a large amount of iron ore buried underground. However, some are not caused by mineral deposits. For example, on the Asian continent, a huge magnetic anomaly zone covering an area of ​​several thousand square kilometers has been discovered in the Soviet Union and China. The cause of this magnetic anomaly is still unclear. Some people explain it by the electromagnetic processes occurring in the liquid core thousands of kilometers deep inside the Earth, while others believe that the problem lies in the characteristics of the geological structure of the Earth's crust. Examinations on the ground and in aircraft cannot determine which view is correct.

Now that the instrument is installed on a satellite and sent to an altitude of 1,880 kilometers, it can be determined at what depth inside the Earth the cause of the magnetic anomaly is hidden.

He also pointed out that the third satellite is also expected to solve another problem. As everyone knows, the Earth's magnetic field is sometimes disrupted by magnetic storms caused by solar particle streams. After these particles enter the atmosphere, strong currents are generated in the ionosphere. Whether this current is inside the ionosphere, or a part of it is outside the ionosphere like Saturn's rings, is also a problem that has not yet been solved.

Garinin pointed out that the magnetometer used to carry out geomagnetic measurements on the third satellite has a power of 20 watts, weighs 12 kilograms, and is made of semiconductors. (Attached picture)

    系统探索大气高层解决磁力异常之谜
    苏联第三个卫星研究规模空前
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科19日讯：苏联阿利佩尔特教授对塔斯社记者发表谈话说，苏联第三个人造地球卫星研究大气高层的计划就实验的规模来说是空前的。在这个卫星上要进行的八种科学研究中就有四种是与电离层外层问题直接有关。从第三个卫星所得到的有关电离层组成和过程的资料将有助于解决物理、地球物理和天体物理方面的很多重要问题。
    阿利佩尔特教授说，第三个卫星可以从五个方面提供有关电离层结构的情报。除测定高层大气的压力和组成、正离子的浓度、太阳微粒辐射强度及地球磁场强度外，对卫星无线电讯号的观测也能提供这方面的宝贵资料。上述实验最重要的特点是：同时用数种方法来研究同一个数值（例如电子浓度）。这就能保证研究结果有着最大的准确性。
    阿利佩尔特接着说，大家知道，卫星运行区内（高于一千公里）大气的基本组成部分是电子、气体中的中子和正离子。根据对第一个人造卫星的观测资料，已经确定了六、七百公里高度以内的高空中这些粒子的波度。通过专门计算，还得出了两、三千公里高空中这些粒子的浓度值，这里，每立方公分中含有不到一个中子、二百到二千个电子和正离子。第三个卫星上的仪器能够核验和进一步证实这些数字。
    卫星上装有特种结构的地磁仪，它可以十分精确地测定地球磁场矢量的方向和强度。地球磁场引起很有趣味的物理效应：一个无线电波在它的作用下分成两个频率不等的电波。比较这些频率，就能相当准确地算出整个电离层内的电子浓度值。
    到目前为止，实际上还不知道大气高层的化学组成。一般认为，那里的基本气体是氧原子和氮原子。然而并不尽然，这些气体还可以处于分子状态，除此以外，那里还有一定数量的氢。卫星上的仪器不但能准确地记录这些气体的存在，而且也能记录大气高层中每种气体的比重。关于大气高层化学组成的资料能够研究出其中的微观过程——电离过程和电子同正离子的复合过程。这样就能够创立电离层形成的理论。
    大气高层的一系列现象——电离层磁暴、电离云的形成，看来都和太阳粒子辐射的影响有关。第三个卫星能够测量太阳粒子流的能量及其定量组成，这样就可能研究太阳粒子对电离层作用的程度和性质。
    新华社莫斯科20日电　为什么地球上某些地方没有引起磁力异常的矿藏也会出现磁力异常现象呢？这个科学界至今未能解决的问题，可望利用苏联第三个人造卫星来解决。
    这是苏联国际地球物理年委员会地磁工作组组长加里宁在对“劳动报”发表谈话时说的。
    加里宁指出，地球上有许多磁力异常区。其中有一些是由于地下蕴藏某种矿藏造成的。如著名的库尔斯克磁力异常区，就是由于地下埋藏了大量铁矿。然而也有一些不是由矿藏造成的。如在亚洲大陆上，苏联和中国国土上就发现了一个面积达几千平方公里的巨大的磁力异常区。这种磁力异常的原因至今还不清楚。有人用在地球内部几千公里深处的液态核中发生的电磁过程来解释，也有人认为问题在于地壳地质构造的特点。而地面和飞机上的考察都不能断定哪种意见正确。
    现在把仪器装在卫星上，送上一千八百八十公里高空，就可以确定，造成磁力异常的原因到底藏在地球内部多少深度之中了。
    他还指出，利用第三个卫星还可望解决另一个问题。大家知道，地球磁场有时会被由太阳微粒流引起的磁暴所破坏。这些微粒进入大气层后，在电离层中就发生了强大的电流。这种电流是在电离层内呢，还是有一部分像土星的环一样在电离层外呢，这也是迄今尚未解决的问题。
    加里宁指出，用来在第三个卫星上进行地磁测量的是磁力计，这个仪器功率达二十瓦，重达十二公斤，是用半导体制成的。（附图片）
