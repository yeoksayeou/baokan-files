    Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, 7th (TASS dispatch): The West German "Association Against Atomic Armament of West Germany" has written to the Copenhagen meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Council, currently in session, demanding that it abandon the arming of the West German army with atomic weapons and requesting the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.
    The letter pointed out that "the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone is safer for the West and the East than arming the Federal Defense Force with atomic weapons." Approximately two-thirds of the West German public opposes arming the Federal Defense Force with atomic weapons, and they are particularly disturbed by the decision on atomic armament passed by the Federal Parliament because it is precisely what those who supported Hitler's rise to power vigorously advocated in the past. The letter pointed out that the German people hope to coexist peacefully and amicably with the people of Eastern and Western countries, and hope to make effective contributions to the general relaxation of tensions and disarmament.
    The letter was signed by seventy West German professors who support the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe.

    西德反原子武装协会发出警告  不许用原子武器武装西德军队
    据新华社7日讯　据塔斯社波恩6日讯：西德“反对西德原子武装行动协会”写信给正在开会的北大西洋公约组织理事会哥本哈根会议，要求放弃用原子武器武装西德军队，要求在中欧建立无原子武器区。　　信中指出，“建立无原子武器区，对西方和东方来说，比用原子武器武装联邦国防军更为安全”。西德约有三分之二的公众反对用原子武器武装联邦国防军，他们之所以对联邦议院通过的原子武装的决定感到不安，特别是因为这正是过去那些拥护希特勒上台的人们所竭力主张的。信中指出，德国人民希望同东西方各国人民和平友好地共处，希望对普遍缓和紧张局势和裁军作出有效贡献。
    在这封信上签名的有支持在中欧建立无原子武器区的七十名西德教授。
