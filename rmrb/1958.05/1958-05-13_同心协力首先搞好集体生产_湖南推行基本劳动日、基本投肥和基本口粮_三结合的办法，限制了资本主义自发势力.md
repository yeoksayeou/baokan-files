　　Work Together to First and Foremost Do a Good Job of Collective Production
　　Hunan Implements a Method Combining Basic Workdays, Basic Fertilizer Application, and Basic Rations to Restrict Capitalist Spontaneous Tendencies
    (Our Report) Hunan Province agricultural cooperatives are universally implementing a management method called "three combinations of basic workdays, basic fertilizer application, and basic rations" in spring plowing production. This method can not only improve collective production and restrict capitalist spontaneous tendencies in rural areas, but more importantly, it can effectively combine the collective interests of the cooperative with the personal interests of its members, and the cooperative's production with the members' lives, enabling it to fully mobilize the production enthusiasm of the vast numbers of members.

    This method, abbreviated as the "three combinations," involves the agricultural cooperative's management committee, based on the cooperative's annual production needs, democratically assessing and specifying the number of workdays each member household should contribute to the cooperative annually, the amount of household fertilizer they should invest in the cooperative, and determining each household's basic rations. At the end of the year, an inspection is conducted, and members who exceed the specified workdays and fertilizer application tasks receive appropriately larger rations; those who fail to complete the specified workdays and fertilizer application tasks without special circumstances receive appropriately smaller rations according to the regulations.

    This method was created by some agricultural cooperatives to adapt to the situation of this year's great leap in production, and also based on summarizing last year's management experience. It was later valued by the CPC Hunan Provincial Committee and quickly promoted throughout the province.

    Last year, some agricultural cooperatives experienced the following situation: the agricultural cooperative's workday plan could not be completed, and members invested very little household fertilizer in the cooperative, directly affecting the completion of the cooperative's production plan. The reason was that the members' work attendance was very uneven. Generally, poor and lower-middle peasants worked more days and applied more fertilizer in the cooperative, while rich peasants and some upper-middle peasants worked fewer days and applied less fertilizer. These few people were not actively engaged in collective production, investing most of their household fertilizer in their private plots and spending most of their time developing individual household sideline occupations and engaging in speculative business. In Shantian Cooperative, Hengnan County, more than eighty laborers were engaged in business outside during the busy farming season last year. In Qingsong Cooperative in the same county, forty-four laborers did not participate in collective production for a year. However, in the year-end settlement and distribution, these people received the same standard rations as members who actively worked and actively applied fertilizer.

    The vast majority of members were very dissatisfied with this phenomenon. The implementation of the "three combinations" method has satisfied the vast number of members' demands to first and foremost do a good job of collective production, plugged the loopholes of laissez-faire in past management, and placed appropriate restrictions on the few members who only cared about themselves and not the collective. Now, in all agricultural cooperatives that have implemented the "three combinations," collective production is in full swing, and everyone's morale is very high. Shou Che Agricultural Cooperative in Yongshun County summarized the eight advantages and four fewer aspects of the "three combinations." The eight advantages are: more workers, more work points, more remuneration, more production increase, more basic rations, more surplus grain, more support for construction, and more model figures. The four fewer aspects are: fewer lazy people, fewer idlers, fewer people engaged in speculative business, and fewer people simply relying on the cooperative.

    Various places encountered resistance at the beginning of implementing the "three combinations" method. However, after mobilizing the masses to conduct airing of views, debates, and launching ideological struggles between the two roads, the method was promoted relatively smoothly. For example, when Wulipai Agricultural Cooperative in Ningxiang County was discussing the "three combinations," upper-middle peasant Peng Xiushou said: "Now that the fields have all entered the cooperative, why are we still doing 'three combinations'? Don't restrict the members too strictly." Poor peasant Shen Pengqing immediately retorted him: "I think we should have 'three combinations.' Last year, when we harvested early rice and transplanted late rice, we were busy day and night, but some people didn't work and made money from their sideline occupations. You, Peng Xiushou, were one of them, and as a result, thirty mu of fields in the whole cooperative were not transplanted. Later, you still divided the same amount of rations as us. Is this reasonable?" After the debate in this cooperative, all the members unanimously agreed to resolutely implement the "three combinations" method.

    When promoting this method, various places have paid attention to strengthening daily political and ideological work, regularly conducting inspections and comparisons, and also helping poor peasant members solve the specific difficulties of work attendance and fertilizer application. When formulating the standards for basic workdays, basic fertilizer application, and basic rations, they are all based on the specific conditions of the cooperative, democratically assessed by the masses, and some places have revised them several times, which the masses are very satisfied with.

    Recently, some places have further enriched the experience of the "three combinations." Most agricultural cooperatives in Yiyang County have divided the annual "three combinations" targets into small segments, evaluating the number of work points to be done, fertilizer to be applied, and basic rations every ten days or half a month, and implementing a reward and punishment system upon inspection at the end of the period. The advantage of doing this is that it can further guarantee the completion of current production tasks, and give members who have not completed their work attendance and fertilizer application tasks the opportunity to make up for it in the next segment.

　　同心协力首先搞好集体生产
　　湖南推行基本劳动日、基本投肥和基本口粮
　　三结合的办法，限制了资本主义自发势力
    本报讯　湖南省各地农业社在春耕生产中，普遍推行一种叫做“基本劳动日、基本投肥和基本口粮三结合”管理办法。这个办法不仅可以搞好集体生产，限制农村的资本主义自发势力，更重要的，它可以把社的集体利益和社员个人利益、把社的生产和社员生活很好地结合起来，能够充分发挥广大社员的生产积极性。
    这个简称“三结合”的办法，就是农业社管委会根据本社全年生产需要，通过民主评议分别规定每户社员在全年内应在社内做多少劳动日，应向社投资多少家肥，同时确定各户的基本口粮。年终检查，超过规定劳动日和投肥任务的社员，就适当多分口粮；没有特殊事故而又完不成规定劳动日和投肥任务的，就按照规定适当少分口粮。
    这个办法是一些农业社适应今年生产大跃进的形势，同时在总结去年的管理经验的基础上创造出来的。后来受到中共湖南省委的重视，很快就在全省推广。
    去年有一部分农业社出现了这样的情况：农业社的劳动日计划完不成，社员向社投资的家肥很少，直接影响了社的生产计划的完成。原因是社员出工很不平衡，一般是贫农、下中农在社出工多，投肥多，而富农和一些上中农出工少，投肥少。这少数人不积极进行集体生产，把绝大部分家肥投在自留地里，以大部分时间去发展个人的家庭副业和做投机生意。衡南县山田社在去年农忙时，有八十多个劳动力在外做生意。这个县的青松社也有四十四个劳动力，一年没有参加集体生产。但是，这些人在年终决算分配时，都和积极出工、积极投肥的社员一样，分到标准相同的口粮。
    对于这种现象，广大社员是很不满意的。推行“三结合”的办法，就满足了广大社员首先搞好集体生产的要求，堵塞了过去管理上放任自流的漏洞，对少数光顾个人不顾集体的社员，有了适当的限制。现在凡是实行“三结合”的农业社，集体生产都搞得轰轰烈烈，大家情绪很高。永顺县首车农业社总结“三结合”的好处有八多四少。八多是：出工人多，工分多，报酬多，增产多，基本口粮多，超产粮多，支援建设多，模范人物多。四少是：懒人少，闲人少，搞投机生意少，单纯依靠社的思想少。
    各地在推行“三结合”的办法时，开始也遇到阻力。但是经过发动群众进行鸣放辩论，展开两条道路的思想斗争以后，便比较顺利地推行了。例如宁乡县五里牌农业社在讨论“三结合”时，上中农彭修寿说：“现在田都入社了，还搞什么‘三结合’，不要把社员卡得太死了。”贫农沈彭清立即反驳他：“我看就要‘三结合’，去年收早稻，插晚秧我们日日夜夜忙，有些人却不出工，自己搞副业赚钱，你彭修寿就是一个，结果影响全社三十亩田没插上秧。你们后来还是和我们一样分同样多的口粮。这是合理的吗。”这个社通过辩论以后，全体社员一致同意坚决实行“三结合”的办法。
    各地在推行这个办法时，都注意加强日常的政治思想工作，经常检查评比，还帮助贫农社员解决出工、投肥的具体困难。在制定基本劳动日、基本投肥、基本口粮的标准时，都是根据本社具体情况，由群众民主评议，有的地方还修订了数次，群众都很满意。
    最近，有些地方又丰富了“三结合”的经验。益阳县大部分农业社把全年“三结合”的指标，划分成小段，每隔十天或半月评出各户应做工分、投肥和基本口粮数字，到期检查，实行奖惩制度。这样做的好处是，可以更进一步地保证当前生产任务的完成，对于一些没有完成出工、投肥任务的社员，使他们有机会在下一段努力弥补。
