Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 18th. The Bulgarian "Labor Daily" published an article on the 17th titled "Modern Revisionism and the Marxist-Leninist Doctrine on the State" by Tsilev, Bachevski, and Andreyev.
　　The article said that in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the state is completely replaced by the bourgeois theory of the supra-class nature of the state. The drafters of the program mentioned changes in the capitalist system in an attempt to prove their anti-Marxist arguments about the state, especially about the modern bourgeois state. They put forward the view that typical capitalism is a thing of the past, and modern capitalism, or more correctly, state-monopoly capitalism, is no longer strictly capitalism, and it has almost "deeply entered" socialism. According to the Yugoslav leaders, it is under these conditions that the modern bourgeois state has lost its class nature.
　　The article continued, the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia distorted the basic tenet of Marxism-Leninism—the dictatorship of the proletariat. The draft program also mentioned the term "dictatorship of the proletariat" in some places, but its purpose was to distort this basic issue of scientific communism.
　　For example, the draft program insisted that the working class can also produce the dictatorship of the proletariat through quantitative accumulation, that is, through the path of evolution, gradually strengthening its position in the bourgeois regime. The leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia called its theory a contribution to Marxism-Leninism and the latest achievement of socialist thought. However, it must be pointed out that this is not a new theory at all, but only a new Bernsteinism.
　　The article said that at a time when capitalism is being corroded by internal economic and political contradictions, and when its decline is approaching and becoming increasingly obvious, the anti-Marxist rhetoric of the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the supra-class nature of the state is best suited to the needs of capitalism. In fact, this "theory" means surrendering to capitalism, and its spearhead is directed at the vital interests of the working class and socialism. The article then pointed out that the documents of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia made harmful and slanderous evaluations of the nature and role of socialist countries in the transition period. It mainly talked about the "bureaucratization" and "degeneration" of socialist countries.
　　According to the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in the Soviet Union, power is concentrated in the hands of state organs, so "there is a tendency towards bureaucratic state totalitarianism, errors occur, and the state political system begins to develop abnormally." Does this statement conform to the actual situation? It is superfluous to argue about this issue, because other than the Yugoslav leaders, only the imperialists propagate the so-called "degeneration" of the Soviet socialist system and the Soviet state. History and practice, the only correct judge (to quote Kadar), refuted such and similar slanders a long time ago.
　　Boris Krajger said at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, "The practice of bureaucratic centralism is related to certain phenomena of hegemonism, all of which led to the outbreak of the Hungarian events in 1956." But, isn't it precisely the opposite that happened? Didn't these events occur precisely because the dictatorship of the proletariat was weakened in Hungary, or more precisely, wasn't it the result of the Hungarian revisionists carrying out separatist and treacherous activities with the active support of the Yugoslav leaders? At that time, the dictatorship of the proletariat had not yet been seriously established in Hungary.
　　The article continued: The Yugoslav revisionists categorically deny everything created by the revolutionary theory and practice of the past forty years related to the doctrine of socialist countries. However, this is a gross distortion of reality. Who doesn't know the contribution of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the common treasury of Marxism-Leninism on the issue of the state. The Yugoslav leaders contemptuously call everything established by the Soviet Union on this issue "Stalin's theory on the state." In fact, Stalin precisely shouldered the historical task of defending the Marxist-Leninist doctrine on the state and creating some new principles. Practice has fully confirmed that the great Marxist-Leninist's exposition on the issue of the state is correct.
　　The Yugoslav revisionists also distort and deny the leading role of the Communist Party in the transition period and oppose strengthening the Party.
　　"Socialism" without the Communists and against the Communists—this slogan has always been put forward and enthusiastically supported by the most reactionary imperialist gangs. This kind of slogan resurfaced in the wave of counter-revolutionary events in Hungary.
　　The program of the Yugoslav revisionists exudes the opportunists' hatred of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the anarchists' fundamental opposition to the state. The Yugoslav leaders preach to others the argument that the state will wither away, but in reality, they do not match their words with their actions, and are constantly strengthening the Yugoslav state, especially the state's oppressive functions; and they are very enthusiastically advising other socialist countries not to get closer to each other, but to pursue "independent policies." They replace proletarian internationalism with malignant bourgeois nationalism, carry out nationalist divisive activities, thereby undermining the unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, and undermining the entire international communist and workers' movement.
　　The article concluded that the fundamental interests of socialism, the interests of the working people of the world, and the cause of peace require the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union to fully consolidate and strengthen themselves. Whoever carries out the opposite propaganda is directly helping international imperialism.

### 保加利亚“劳动报”载文指出  南共纲领歪曲无产阶级专政  破坏以苏联为首的社会主义国家团结

　　保加利亚“劳动报”载文指出
　　南共纲领歪曲无产阶级专政
　　破坏以苏联为首的社会主义国家团结
    新华社索非亚18日电　保加利亚“劳动报”17日以“现代修正主义和马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说”为题发表了齐列夫、巴切夫斯基和安德烈耶夫的文章。
    文章说，在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中，马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说完全被资产阶级关于国家的超阶级性质的理论所偷换。纲领起草人提到资本主义制度的变化，企图证实自己关于国家，特别是关于现代资产阶级国家的反马克思主义的论点。他们提出了这样一种观点：典型的资本主义已经是过去的陈迹，现代资本主义；或者更正确地说，国家垄断资本主义严格说来已经不是资本主义了，它差不多已经“深深进入”社会主义了。根据南斯拉夫领导人的说法，正是在这些条件下，现代资产阶级国家失去了自己的阶级性质。
    文章接着说，南共领导集团歪曲了马克思列宁主义的基本的东西——无产阶级专政。纲领草案在一些地方也提到了“无产阶级专政”这个名词，但是，其目的是要歪曲科学共产主义的这个基本问题。
    例如，纲领草案硬说，工人阶级通过量的积累，即通过进化的道路，逐步加强自己在资产阶级政权制度中的地位，也可能产生无产阶级专政。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团就把它的这种理论称为对马克思列宁主义的贡献，称为社会主义思想的最新成就。但是，必须指出，这根本不是什么新理论，只是新的伯恩施坦主义。
    文章说，在资本主义被内部经济矛盾和政治矛盾腐蚀的时候，在它的没落日益临近和日益明显的时候，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导集团关于国家的超阶级性质的反马克思主义论调是最适合资本主义需要的。实际上，这种“理论”意味着向资本主义投降，而其矛头是指向工人阶级和社会主义的切身利益。文章接着指出，南共第七次代表大会文件对社会主义国家在过渡时期的性质和作用作了有害的诬蔑性的评价。其中主要谈的是社会主义国家“官僚化”和“蜕化”。
    根据南共纲领的说法，在苏联，权力集中在国家机关手中，于是“出现了官僚主义的国家极权倾向，出现了错误，国家政治制度开始畸形发展”。这种说法符合实际情况吗？对这个问题进行争论是多余的，因为宣传所谓苏联社会主义制度和苏维埃国家“蜕化”的，除了南斯拉夫领导人之外就只有帝国主义者。历史和实践这个唯一正确的裁判官（引用卡德尔的话）很早以前就驳倒了这样和诸如此类的诽谤。
    鲍里斯·克雷伊格尔在南共第七次代表大会上说，“官僚集权的做法是同霸权的某些现象相联系的，这一切导致了1956年匈牙利事件的爆发。”但是，难道事情不正是在相反的情况下发生的吗？难道这些事件的发生不正是因为无产阶级专政在匈牙利遭到削弱吗，或者更确切地说，不正是匈牙利修正主义者在南斯拉夫领导人积极地支持下进行分裂和背叛活动的结果吗？当时在匈牙利还没有认真地建立起无产阶级专政。
    文章接着写道：南斯拉夫的修正主义者断然否定最近四十年来革命的理论和实践所创造的一切有关社会主义国家的学说。但是，这是对现实的粗暴歪曲。谁不知道苏联共产党在国家问题上对马克思列宁主义共同宝库的贡献。南斯拉夫领导人把苏联关于这个问题所建立的一切东西都轻蔑地叫做“斯大林关于国家的理论”。实际上，斯大林恰恰肩负起了捍卫马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说和创立一些新原理的历史任务。实践完全证实了，这位伟大的马克思列宁主义者在国家问题上的论述是正确的。
    南斯拉夫的修正主义者还歪曲和否定共产党在过渡时期的领导作用，并反对加强党。
    要“社会主义”，然而不要共产党人而且反对共产党人——这种口号不管过去和现在一直都是由最反动的帝国主义黑帮提出来并热狂地加以支持的。这类口号曾在匈牙利的反革命事件的波浪中再次浮了起来。
    南斯拉夫修正主义者的纲领发散出机会主义者对无产阶级专政的仇恨和无政府主义者根本反对国家的气息。南斯拉夫领导人向别人宣传国家消亡的论点，实际上却言行不符，时时刻刻都在加强南斯拉夫国家，特别是国家的压迫职能；并且非常热心地劝告其他社会主义国家不要相互接近，而要奉行“独立的政策”。他们用恶性的资产阶级民族主义代替无产阶级国际主义，进行民族主义的分裂活动，从而破坏以苏联为首的社会主义国家的团结，破坏整个国际共产主义和工人运动。
    文章最后说，社会主义的根本利益，全世界劳动人民的利益与和平事业要求以苏联为首的社会主义国家全力巩固和加强起来。谁要是进行反面的宣传，谁就是直接帮助了国际帝国主义。
