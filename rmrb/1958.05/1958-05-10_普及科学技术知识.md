Popularize Scientific and Technological Knowledge

The beginning of the technological revolution is accompanied by the beginning of the cultural revolution. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production requires the popularization of scientific and technological knowledge to serve production. Since its establishment, the cultural and technical night school in Xiaomiao Township, Tianmen County, has been welcomed by the masses, and men and women, young and old, in the township have actively enrolled. Many people have changed from illiterate to semi-literate or literate, from not understanding new agricultural technologies to understanding some agricultural technologies or mastering agricultural technologies - a new cultural and technical force has begun to grow. Now Hubei is promoting the experience of Xiaomiao Township, and has also achieved results. This is a matter that deserves attention in today's new situation of technological revolution.

In recent years, the work of eliminating illiteracy and learning culture carried out in various places has achieved great results; but some places have done poorly, unable to persist, almost forming a law: "Tight in winter, loose in spring, collapse in summer." This is due to the disconnection from production and the transmission of technical knowledge.

The cultural and technical night schools run by Tianmen County and Qinshui County have broad mass character. Zhejiang and other places are also carrying out activities to popularize scientific and technological knowledge. This enables the broad masses of people who urgently need scientific and technological knowledge to gradually acquire knowledge and solve problems that occur in production. We hope that all localities will do everything possible to popularize scientific and technological knowledge among the broad masses of workers and peasants, serve socialist economic construction, and better implement the general line of socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee.

    普及科学技术知识
    技术革命的开始，伴随而来的是文化革命的开始。工农业生产的大跃进，要求普及科学技术知识，为生产服务。天门县小庙乡的文化技术夜校自创办以来，得到广大群众的欢迎，全乡男女老小积极入学。不少人由文盲变成半文盲或非文盲，由不懂新的农业技术，变成懂得部分农业技术或通晓农业技术——一支新的文化技术队伍开始成长起来了。现在湖北各地正在推广小庙乡的经验，也已收到成效。这在面临技术革命新形势的今天，是一件值得重视的事情。
    近几年来，各地开展的扫除文盲、学习文化的工作，已经取得很大成绩；但也有些地方进行较差，不能坚持，几乎形成一种规律：“冬紧、春松，夏垮台。”这是由于同生产、同传授技术知识脱节所致。
    天门县和沁水县所开办的文化技术夜校都具有广泛的群众性。浙江等地也都在开展普及科学技术知识的活动。这就使迫切需要科学技术知识的广大人民能够逐步获得知识，解决生产中所发生的问题。我们希望各地都能想尽千方百计，把科学技术知识普及到广大工农群众中去，为社会主义经济建设服务，更好地贯彻执行党中央提出的社会主义建设的总路线。
