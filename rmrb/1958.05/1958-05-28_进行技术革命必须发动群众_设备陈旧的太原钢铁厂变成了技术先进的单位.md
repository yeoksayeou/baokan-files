Taiyuan, May 27th (People's Daily reporter Ma Ming, Fan Fuhuai) A widespread mass-based technological innovation movement is changing the outdated equipment and backward production methods of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. After liberation, the plant was expanded into a comprehensive iron and steel complex. However, the long-term backwardness in production only saw significant changes after the rectification movement and the launch of mass technological innovation.

Now, new records, new creations, and new products appear almost every day at this plant. In terms of production and construction, among the 3,383 new technologies that have been innovated, 28 have reached the advanced national level. The nationally renowned three-tap steel tapping method, the reduction of blast furnace utilization coefficient, the reduction of iron core loss in transformer silicon steel sheets, and the successful testing of extra-dry hard concrete have played a significant role in improving quality, increasing production, and reducing costs. After the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department adopted the three-tap steel tapping method, the output of each furnace of steel increased by an average of 42%. The blast furnace in the ironmaking department, which had always been backward in production, has created 29 new historical records in the first four months of this year, with its utilization coefficient leaping to the first place in the country, and it has increased the production of pig iron by more than 10,000 tons for the country.

Eliminating the Mystical View of Technology

This tremendous change is the result of breaking down superstitions, opposing conservatism, and carrying out a technological innovation movement in a great leap forward in production characterized by competing to be advanced, competing to achieve more, faster, better, and more economically. In the early stage of carrying out the technological innovation movement, the plant encountered resistance from conservative thinking that believed in "equipment conditions." They were content with the current state of equilibrium in production, believing that those with good equipment conditions could make a leap forward, while those like the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, with outdated equipment and poor raw materials, could not. Or they said that to make a leap forward, it was necessary to increase equipment and manpower. They were superstitious about books and past experiences and habits, and they did not dare to be bold and original. At this moment, the workers of the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department, under the instructions of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, spent six days successfully testing the three-tap steel tapping method, increasing the output of each furnace of steel from 95 tons to 135 tons. This major reform not only increased the output of steel but also found the law that technological reform must be combined with solving the key and weak links in production to achieve the leap forward plan. That is, with the reform of the main equipment of the three-tap steel tapping method (key to production), it caused an imbalance in production, and then by improving the casting capacity, improving the steel ladle and slag pot and other auxiliary equipment (weak links), a new balance in production was achieved. This shows that the process of technological reform is a process of making production go from balance to imbalance, and from imbalance to a new balance. The three-tap steel tapping method only added a tap to the old equipment, but it increased the output of steel by 42% compared to the original, which shattered the pessimistic view of some people that production could not leap forward with outdated equipment, eliminated people's mystical view of technology, and liberated people's thinking.

Think of What Predecessors Have Not Thought of
Do What the World Has Not Done

The Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee analyzed this new situation, first grasped the example of the successful trial of the three-tap steel tapping method in the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department, publicized its significance in a big way, and discussed the reasons for the successful trial of the three-tap steel tapping method, combined with reality to understand and eliminate the ideological obstacles to carrying out technological innovation. After discussion, it was clarified that it was wrong to one-sidedly emphasize objective factors such as outdated equipment and poor raw materials, while lacking sufficient understanding of these objective conditions, the workers' communist consciousness, initiative, and creativity. In particular, when Comrade Liu Shaoqi came to the plant to inspect the work, he encouraged everyone to boldly solve technical problems and think of things that predecessors had not thought of, and things that the world had not done, we should do them. These words gave the plant's workers great enlightenment and education, and broke down conservative thinking.

In order to closely combine the technological innovation movement carried out by the various production units with solving the key and weak links in production to achieve the leap forward plan, the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant Party Committee specially summarized and promoted the experience of the three-tap steel tapping method in the No. 3 open-hearth furnace in the steelmaking department. The workers of the electric furnace steelmaking department first created a smelting method for carbon steel that eliminated the reduction period, and the smelting time for each furnace of carbon steel was shortened by 40 minutes compared with the original, and the quality of the steel was also completely qualified. With the increase in steel production and the shortening of smelting time, the new problem was that the casting could not keep up, and the steel ladle was not enough, and it was necessary to improve the casting capacity and improve the equipment of the steel ladle in order to solve the imbalance in production. After they reformed these technologies one by one, they will be able to increase production by 3,500 tons of steel this year.

Support and Encourage the Masses to Create Boldly
Reform the Rules and Regulations That Hinder Innovation

In order to make the technological innovation movement develop vigorously, the leading cadres at all levels of the plant, while persisting in "experimental fields" and "working shifts," on the one hand, supported and encouraged the experimental creation of technicians and workers, and on the other hand, helped to revise the unreasonable rules and regulations that restricted the development of productive forces. The leading cadres of the ironmaking department Party committee found that there were differences of opinion on how to increase the output of blast furnace ironmaking, and immediately organized a technical debate, letting both sides put forward their opinions and explain the advantages and disadvantages. At the meeting, the bold attempt of workers to increase the intensity of smelting to increase the production of pig iron was encouraged on the spot. And according to the experience of successful experiments, they also helped to revise the original unreasonable regulations that restricted the increase of smelting intensity. As a result, the output of pig iron from the blast furnace in the first four months of this year increased by 19.22% compared with the same period last year. In the past month or so, the plant has put forward 35,111 suggestions for technological innovation alone, including opinions on improving tools, equipment, operating methods, and reforming process regulations, as well as a large number of trial production of new products and changes in design, reform of enterprise management methods, and improvement of the work of functional departments. These suggestions are being absorbed and handled by workers through lively technical debates, small-scale exhibitions, technical performances, and on-site meetings. Many technical reform suggestions put forward by various units have been quickly handled by close cooperation between leading cadres, technicians, and workers. In order to quickly transform the four low-speed cutting lathes into high-speed cutting lathes, the workers of the fitter team of the machine repair workshop of the refractory material department used their rest time to personally find high-speed cutting tools in the warehouse, and took the initiative to learn new operating methods from nearby machine factories, and within two days, the efficiency of the lathes was increased from one to eight times.

In carrying out technological innovation, various units in the plant have widely carried out mutual cooperation. In the past, the raw coal used for coking in the coking department was mostly transported from remote areas outside the province. Now, the technicians of this department have found low-sulfur coal suitable for coking in the Xinzhi Coal Mine in Huoxian County, Shanxi Province. After repeated tests, high-quality coke was produced. The blast furnace in the ironmaking department used this coke to improve the smelting method, which rapidly increased the production of pig iron. The timely technical identification and satisfaction of production needs by the testing, transportation, and supply units also played a significant role in the smooth progress of the technical reforms of the production units.

Recently, he and lathe operator Peng Dasheng (left) have tried to use a thread rolling machine to process grate pins (a kind of part), which has increased work efficiency by 58 times. It is estimated that this innovation can save three tons of steel a year. This is Gu Liufa processing grate pins with a thread rolling machine.

    进行技术革命必须发动群众
    设备陈旧的太原钢铁厂变成了技术先进的单位
    本报太原27日电　本报记者马明、范服怀报道：广泛展开群众性的技术革新运动，正在改变着太原钢铁厂设备陈旧、生产落后的面貌。解放后，这个厂经过扩建已成为综合性的钢铁联合企业。但是，生产上长期落后的状态，却是经过整风运动开展群众性的技术革新以后才有了显著变化。
    这个厂现在几乎每天都有新纪录、新创造和新产品出现。在生产建设方面，已经革新了的三千三百八十三项新技术中，有二十八项达到了全国先进水平。闻名全国的三槽出钢、降低高炉利用系数、降低变压器硅（矽）钢片的铁心损失和特干硬性混凝土的试验成功，对提高质量、增加产量和降低成本起了很大作用。炼钢部三号平炉采用三槽出钢生产以后，每炉钢的产量平均提高42％。生产一向落后的炼铁部高炉，在今年头四个多月已经创造了二十九次历史新纪录，利用系数跃居全国第一位，并且为国家增产生铁一万多吨。
    破除了技术神秘的观点
    这种巨大的变化，是破除迷信、反对保守和开展比先进、比多快好省的生产大跃进开展技术革新运动的结果。这个厂在开展技术革新运动的初期，遇到迷信“设备条件”的保守思想阻力，他们安于现在生产上的那种平衡状态，认为设备条件好的可以跃进，像太原钢铁厂这样设备陈旧、原料又不好的就不能大跃进。或者说要跃进就得增加设备、增加人。他们迷信书本和过去的经验习惯，不敢大胆地独创。正在这时，炼钢部三号平炉的职工，在刘少奇同志的指示下，费时六天就试验成功了三槽出钢，使每炉钢的产量由九十五吨提高到一百三十五吨。这一重大改革，不仅提高了钢的产量，而且找到了技术改革必须和解决实现跃进计划的生产关键、薄弱环节相结合的规律。这就是随着三槽出钢主要设备的改革（生产关键），引起了生产上的不平衡，又经过提高铸锭能力、改进钢水包与渣锅等辅助设备（薄弱环节），求得生产上新的平衡。这说明技术改革的过程，就是使生产由平衡到不平衡，由不平衡到新的平衡的过程。三槽出钢只不过在旧的设备上增加了一个槽子，便使钢的产量比原来增加了42％，这就打破了有些人认为陈旧的设备生产无法跃进的悲观论调，破除了人们对技术的神秘观点，解放了人们的思想。
    要想前人没有想过的
    做世界上没有做过的
    中共太原钢铁厂党委会分析了这种新的情况，首先抓住炼钢部三号平炉三槽出钢试验成功的实例，大张旗鼓地宣传它的意义，并且讨论三槽出钢试验成功的原因，联系实际认识解除了开展技术革新的思想障碍。经过讨论明确了片面地强调设备陈旧、原料不好等客观因素，而对这些客观条件、职工的共产主义觉悟和积极性创造性认识不足是不对的。特别是刘少奇同志来这个厂检查工作时，鼓励大家大胆地解决技术问题，要想前人没有想过的事，世界上没有的事我们要做。这些话给全厂职工以极大的启示和教育，打破了保守思想。
    中共太原钢铁厂党委会为了使各生产单位开展的技术革新运动和解决实现跃进计划的生产关键、薄弱环节密切结合，专门总结、推广了炼钢部三号平炉三槽出钢的经验。电炉炼钢部职工首先创造了冶炼炭素钢取消还原期的冶炼方法，每炉炭素钢的冶炼时间比原来缩短了四十分钟，钢的质量也完全合格。随着钢的产量增加和冶炼时间的缩短，带来新的问题是：铸锭赶不上，盛钢筒不够用，必须提高铸锭能力和改进盛钢筒的设备，才能解决生产上的不平衡现象。他们逐一改革这些技术以后，今年能够增产三千五百吨钢。
  支持和鼓励群众大胆创造
  改革阻碍革新的规章制度
    为了使技术革新运动得到蓬勃发展，这个厂的各级领导干部在坚持搞“试验田”、“跟班劳动”中，一面支持和鼓励技术人员和职工的试验创造，一面帮助修改束缚生产力发展的不合理规章制度。炼铁部党委会的领导干部，发现在如何提高高炉炼铁产量问题上有分歧意见，便立即组织了技术辩论会，让双方提出意见，讲清利弊。会上，当场鼓励了职工提出的提高冶炼强度增产生铁的大胆尝试。并且根据试验成功的经验，又帮助修改了原来限制提高冶炼强度的不合理规定。结果使今年头四个月高炉的生铁产量比去年同期增加了19.22％。最近一个多月来，全厂仅提出技术革新的建议就达三万五千一百一十一项，内有改进工具、设备、操作方法和改革工艺规程的意见，也有新产品的大量试制和改变设计、改革企业管理方法、改进职能科室工作的内容。这些建议，正在通过热烈进行的各种技术辩论会、小型展览会、技术表演和现场会议，吸收职工群众动手及时处理。许多单位提出的技术改革建议，很快便被领导干部、技术人员和工人密切结合处理了。耐火材料部机修车间机工组的工人们为了使四部低速切削的元车很快改成高速切削的，他们利用工休时间，亲自到仓库里找来高速切削刀，又主动到附近机器厂学会了新的操作方法，两天内便使车床的效率提高了一至八倍。
    这个厂在开展技术革新中，各个单位之间广泛开展了相互协作配合。炼焦部过去炼焦使用的原煤，大部分是由省外远程运来的，现在这个部的技术人员在山西霍县辛置煤矿找到了适合炼焦使用的低硫煤。经过反复试验，炼出了优质焦炭。炼铁部高炉采用这种焦炭，改进冶炼方法，使生铁产量迅速增加。由于试验、运输、供应等单位及时进行技术鉴定和满足生产的需要，对生产单位技术改革的顺利进行也起了很大作用。（附图片）
    上海锅炉厂曾经一度忘本的青工顾六法（右），转变以后，也积极参加了技术革新运动。最近，他和车工彭大生（左）一起，试用搓丝机加工炉排销子（是一种零件），提高工作效率五十八倍。据估计，这项革新一年可节约钢材三吨。这是顾六法正在用搓丝机加工炉排销子。
