In the magnificent afforestation movement, a number of cooperative-run forest farms have emerged across various regions. According to incomplete statistics from sixteen counties in six provinces, including Hubei, Henan, and Hebei, there are already two hundred and thirty-five cooperative-run forest farms.

The largest number of cooperative-run forest farms is in Huangmei County, Hubei Province. As of early April, the county had established one hundred and sixty-eight cooperative-run forest farms. In six townships, including Xiangcai, Shuima, Wangjiang, and Youpu, every cooperative runs a forest farm. Each cooperative forest farm has conducted comprehensive planning, determining to focus on forestry while engaging in diversified operations, striving for self-sufficiency and surplus. This year, the October Agricultural Cooperative forest farm plans for each person to harvest seven hundred and seventy catties of grain (intercropping between forests and farms) and one hundred yuan in cash, achieving self-sufficiency with a surplus. The reason Huangmei County was able to establish so many cooperative-run forest farms in a short period of time is mainly because the county leadership, based on the demands of the masses, seized on exemplary cases and rapidly promoted them.

Cooperatives running forest farms is a good way to develop forestry production, overcome contradictions between agriculture and forestry, carry out diversified operations, increase the income of the masses, and also an important measure to consolidate the achievements of large-scale afforestation.

    合作社办林场好处多
    本报讯　在规模壮阔的造林运动中，各地出现了一批合作社营林场。仅据湖北、河南、河北等六省十六个县的不完全统计，社办林场就有二百三十五处。
    社办林场最多的是湖北省黄梅县，该县截至4月初社办林场已达一百六十八个。向蔡、水码、望江、油铺等六个乡，社社办林场。各社林场都进行了全面规划，确定以林为主，开展多种经营，力争自给有余。十月农业社林场今年计划每人收获粮食七百七十斤（林农间作）、现金一百元，作到自给有余。黄梅县所以能在短时间内办起这么多社办林场，主要是由于县里领导根据群众的要求，抓住典型迅速推广。
    社社办林场是发展林业生产，克服农林矛盾，开展多种经营，增加群众收入的好办法，也是巩固大面积造林成就的一项重要措施。
