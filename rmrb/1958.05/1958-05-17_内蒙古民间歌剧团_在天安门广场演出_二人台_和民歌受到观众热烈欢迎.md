Xinhua News Agency, 16th: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's Hohhot Folk Opera Troupe, consisting of more than 40 members, arrived in Beijing today. As soon as the actors got off the train, they went to Tiananmen Square to perform "Errentai" and folk songs from the Inner Mongolia region for over a thousand spectators, receiving a warm welcome.

This is the troupe's first visit to Beijing. Their performances mainly consist of "Errentai," a traditional folk small-scale song and dance drama from the Inner Mongolia region. The troupe is composed of Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Manchu actors who frequently tour agricultural areas and factories. Their repertoire includes more than ten traditional pieces such as "Playing with Golden Coins," "Picking Cherries," and "Selling Vegetables," as well as pieces reflecting contemporary life such as "Hanging Red Lanterns" and "Handling Affairs Officially." The troupe will also perform Inner Mongolian folk music ensembles and folk song choruses.

The troupe will begin public performances at the People's Theatre starting on the 20th, and will also perform at factories in Beijing and the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site.
