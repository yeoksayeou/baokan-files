Xinhua News Agency, 16th - Chinese mechanics Qian Xuesen, Guo Yonghuai, Lin Hongsun, and Lin Tongji, at the request of Xinhua News Agency reporters today, expressed their thoughts on the Soviet Union's launch of its third artificial Earth satellite. They stated that the Soviet Union's launch of such a significant artificial satellite has increased their enthusiasm for the Great Leap Forward; it has made them believe that under the socialist system, with politics in command, anything can be accomplished successfully.

They calculated how much the launch rocket for the 1,300-plus kilogram satellite launched by the Soviet Union would weigh. They believe that if liquid oxygen and alcohol were used as fuel as in the past, the launch rocket would weigh at least 1,000 tons or more. If new fuels were used, the launch weight could be reduced significantly. Assuming that the bottom stage rocket uses new fuel, the launch weight could be reduced to 500 tons. Qian Xuesen estimates that the Soviet Union must have considered switching to new fuels to reduce the weight of the launch rocket when launching such a heavy artificial satellite. He believes that the Soviet Union would first consider using fuels that are better than the original liquid oxygen and alcohol; secondly, the Soviet Union would consider using special high-energy fuels; and thirdly, it would consider using an atomic reactor as the combustion chamber of the rocket. If new fuels are used, the structure of the rocket would need fundamental innovation.

Qian Xuesen said that the Soviet Union's ability to launch such a heavy Earth satellite proves that the Soviet Union can immediately launch a lunar satellite. It only needs to change the 1,300-plus kilogram Earth satellite launched this time into the final stage rocket, and carry a lunar surveyor as heavy as the first Earth satellite (i.e., 83.6 kilograms). The only difference is that launching a lunar satellite requires strict control of speed and direction.

    估计苏联立即可以发射月球卫星
    钱学森等谈苏联第三个卫星发射成功的意义
    新华社16日讯　我国力学家钱学森、郭永怀、林鸿荪和林同骥，今日应新华社记者的要求，对苏联发射的第三个人造地球卫星发表感想。他们表示苏联发射出这样一个重大的人造卫星，给他们增加了大跃进的干劲；使他们相信：在社会主义制度下，政治作统帅，那末什么事情都可以干得成功的。
    他们计算了一下苏联发射这个一千三百多公斤重的卫星起飞火箭需要多少重量。他们认为如果用过去所用的液态氧和酒精作燃料，那么起飞火箭的重量至少在一千吨以上；如果用新的燃料，起飞重量可以减少很多；假设最底下一节火箭用新的燃料，起飞重量就可降低到五百吨。钱学森估计苏联发射这样重的人造卫星，必定会考虑到改用新的燃料来减轻起飞火箭的重量。他认为苏联首先会考虑到采用比原来所用液氧加酒精要好一些的燃料；第二步，苏联会考虑到采用特殊高能燃料；第三步会考虑到用原子反应堆作为火箭的燃烧室；如果改用了新的燃料，火箭的结构就需要有根本的革新。
    钱学森说，苏联能发射出这样重的地球卫星，证明苏联立即可以发射出月球卫星，只要把这次发射的一千三百多公斤重的地球卫星改为最后一节火箭，带上一个像第一个地球卫星那么重（即八十三点六公斤）的月球测视器，就行了，所不同的只是发射月球卫星需要严格控制速度和方向而已。
