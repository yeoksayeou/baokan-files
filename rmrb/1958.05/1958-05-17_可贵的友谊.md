A Precious Friendship

More than two weeks ago, President Nasser of the United Arab Republic paid a friendly visit to the Soviet Union and was warmly welcomed and received by the Soviet government and people. President Nasser visited many places in the Soviet Union and held friendly talks with Soviet government leaders. On May 15, the Soviet government and the government of the United Arab Republic issued a joint statement expressing their unanimous views on issues of common interest to both countries and a series of international issues and events that have attracted world public opinion. President Nasser's visit to the Soviet Union will promote the further development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the Arab people.

As the joint statement points out, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic have been close and continuously developing in recent years. Whenever the Arab people have suffered from imperialist threats and attacks, the Soviet Union has stepped forward to strongly support the just struggle of the Arab people. In the Egyptian people's resistance to the armed aggression by Britain, France, and Israel the year before last, and in the Syrian people's struggle against the American war threat last year, the Soviet Union extended a helping hand. At the same time, the Soviet Union has actively supported Arab countries in developing their national economies and consolidating their independence. Since last year, the Soviet Union has successively signed economic and technical cooperation agreements with Egypt and Syria, providing the two countries with long-term, low-interest loans and technical assistance to help them build important industrial and mining enterprises such as mining, metallurgy, machinery manufacturing, transportation, fertilizer, and textiles. This kind of assistance from the Soviet Union is completely selfless and is a manifestation of the Soviet people's sincere friendship towards the Arab people. Therefore, President Nasser warmly pointed out during his visit to the Soviet Union: The people of the United Arab Republic and the people of other Arab countries regard the Soviet Union as their friend. This friend helps them not for its own selfish interests, but to strengthen the freedom and independence of the Arab countries. We are proud of this friendship and will strive to strengthen and consolidate it.

The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic have a solid foundation. The joint statement announced that the two governments adhere to the principle of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems and reaffirmed their support for the principles declared at the Bandung Conference. At the same time, both governments "condemn colonialism in all its forms and manifestations and support the right of all peoples to self-determination and independence." To demand peaceful coexistence and oppose colonialism is the common position of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. This is also the common position of all socialist countries and nationally independent countries. The friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic provide a good example of peaceful coexistence between countries with different social systems. This friendly relationship also proves that socialist countries and nationally independent countries can not only coexist peacefully, but also support and cooperate with each other in the common struggle for world peace and against colonialism.

Based on their common stance against colonialism, the governments of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic expressed unanimous support for the national independence movements in Asia and Africa. The joint statement pointed out that the two governments guarantee their full support for the legitimate rights of the Palestinian Arabs and the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of Yemen. The two governments called for a peaceful resolution of the Algerian issue on the basis of supporting the self-determination and independence of the Algerian people, and demanded that some foreign governments cease their interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. All of these are of positive significance. As everyone knows, the colonialist forces headed by the United States are intensifying their policies of colonial aggression everywhere. At present, in Indonesia, in the Near and Middle East, and in North Africa, the colonialists are launching frantic offensives, attempting to block the surging national independence movements in Asia and Africa. To defeat the colonialists, the most needed thing is the unity of the people of all countries. The joint statement of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is a great encouragement to the people of Asian and African countries who are engaged in struggle and a powerful blow to the colonialists.

Both the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic are working to safeguard peace. The Soviet government's recent active proposal to convene a summit conference and its peaceful action to announce a unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing have been welcomed and praised by the Arab people. In the joint statement, the two governments expressed their deep concern about the arms race and advocated that all countries should stop nuclear weapons testing and redouble their efforts to conclude an agreement on a substantial reduction of the armed forces and armaments of all countries. The two governments also believe that a summit conference attended by major powers and some other countries should be convened as soon as possible. This is undoubtedly also the call of the people of the world and will resonate with hundreds of millions of peace-loving people and have a positive impact.

The friendship between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic is a friendship of peace. But imperialism fears it, opposes it, and tries every possible way to undermine it. Imperialism is distorting the Soviet Union's peace policy every day, trying to sow discord between the Soviet Union and the Arab people. When President Nasser visited the Soviet Union, the American propaganda machine attacked him fiercely, even clamoring that visiting the Soviet Union was a "mistake." The imperialists brazenly came to "teach" the Arab people a lesson. However, the vast majority of the Arab people are increasingly seeing clearly that the imperialists are not friends, but enemies. Therefore, what the imperialists say is a mistake is precisely what the Arab people have done right.

Our people attach great importance to and are pleased to see the development of friendly relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic. China and the United Arab Republic are also friendly countries. May the cause of peace and friendly cooperation of the Soviet Union, China, the United Arab Republic, and the people of all countries in the world be continuously strengthened and developed!

### 可贵的友谊

　　可贵的友谊
    两个多星期以前，阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔到苏联进行友好访问，受到苏联政府和人民的热烈欢迎和接待。纳赛尔总统在苏联参观了许多地方，并同苏联政府领导人进行了友好的会谈。5月15日，苏联政府和阿拉伯联合共和国政府发表了联合声明，就有关两国共同利益的问题和引起世界舆论注意的一系列国际问题和事件，表示了一致的看法。纳赛尔总统对苏联的访问，将会促进苏联和阿拉伯人民友好关系的进一步发展。
    正如联合声明所指出，近年来苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国之间的友好关系是紧密的，并且是不断发展的。每当阿拉伯人民遭受帝国主义的威胁和攻击的时候，苏联便挺身而出，有力地支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争。在前年埃及人民抵抗英、法、以色列的武装侵略和去年叙利亚人民反对美国战争威胁的斗争中，苏联都伸出了援助之手。同时，苏联也积极支持阿拉伯国家发展自己的民族经济，巩固自己的独立。去年以来苏联曾先后和埃及、叙利亚签订了经济技术合作协定，向两国提供了低利的长期贷款和技术援助，帮助两国建设采矿、冶金、机器制造、交通、肥料、纺织等重要工矿企业。苏联这种援助，完全是无私的，它是苏联人民对阿拉伯人民的真挚友谊的表现。因此，纳赛尔总统在访问苏联时曾热情地指出：阿拉伯联合共和国人民和其他阿拉伯国家人民把苏联看做是自己的朋友。这个朋友帮助他们不是为了自己的私利，而是为了加强阿拉伯国家的自由和独立。我们为这种友谊感到自豪，并将努力加强和巩固这种友谊。
    苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友好关系是有着巩固基础的。联合声明宣布了两国政府坚持社会制度不同的国家和平共处的原则，并重申支持万隆会议宣布的原则。同时，两国政府都“谴责通过各种形式在各个方面表现出来的殖民主义，支持各国人民自决和独立的权利”。要求和平共处，反对殖民主义，这就是苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的共同立场。这也是一切社会主义国家和民族独立国家的共同立场。苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友好关系，为不同社会制度的国家的和平共处提供了一个良好的范例。这种友好关系还证明了，社会主义国家和民族独立国家不但可以和平共处，而且在争取世界和平和反对殖民主义的共同斗争中，可以互相支持，互相合作。
    苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国两国政府本着反对殖民主义的共同立场，对于目前亚非地区的民族独立运动表示了一致的支持。联合声明指出，两国政府保证全力支持巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人的合法权利和也门的独立、主权与领土完整。两国政府呼吁在支持阿尔及利亚人民自决和独立的基础上，和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且要求停止一些外国政府对印度尼西亚内政的干涉。所有这些都是具有积极意义的。大家知道，以美国为首的殖民主义势力，变本加厉地到处进行殖民侵略的政策。目前，在印度尼西亚，在中近东，在北非，殖民主义者正在进行疯狂的进攻，企图阻挡亚非地区风起云涌的民族独立运动。为了打败殖民主义者，最需要的就是各国人民的团结。苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的联合声明，对于正在进行斗争中的亚非各国人民是一个很大的鼓舞，对于殖民主义者是一个有力的打击。
    苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国都正在为维护和平而努力。苏联政府最近期间积极建议召开最高级会议和宣布单方面停止试验核武器的和平行动，受到了阿拉伯人民的欢迎和赞扬。两国政府在联合声明中表示了对于军备竞赛的深切忧虑，而主张一切国家都应该停止核武器试验，并加倍努力来缔结一项关于大大裁减各国武装部队和军备的协定。两国政府并且认为有大国和其他一些国家参加的最高级会议，应当尽速召开。这无疑也是世界各国人民的呼声，必将引起千百万爱好和平人民的共鸣，并产生积极的影响。
    苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的友谊，是和平的友谊。但是帝国主义却害怕它，反对它，千方百计地想要破坏它。帝国主义天天在歪曲苏联的和平政策，挑拨苏联同阿拉伯人民之间的关系。当纳赛尔总统访问苏联时，美国宣传机关竟大肆攻击他，甚至叫嚷说访问苏联是个“错误”。帝国主义者大言不惭地来“教训”阿拉伯人民。可是广大的阿拉伯人民越来越看清楚了，帝国主义者并不是朋友，而是敌人。因之，帝国主义者说做错了的事，对于阿拉伯人民来说，恰恰是做对了。
    我国人民非常重视并且高兴看到苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国友好关系的发展。中国和阿拉伯联合共和国同样是友好的国家。愿苏联、中国、阿拉伯联合共和国和世界各国人民的和平事业和友好合作事业不断加强，不断发展！
