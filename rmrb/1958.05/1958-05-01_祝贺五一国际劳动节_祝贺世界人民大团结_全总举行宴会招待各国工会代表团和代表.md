Xinhua News Agency, 30th April. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions held a grand banquet this evening to celebrate "May Day" International Labour Day together with thirty-three trade union delegations and trade union representatives from twenty-six countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and Australia.

    The banquet, held at the Beijing Hotel, was filled with an atmosphere of unity and friendship from beginning to end. People of all skin colours and in various costumes laughed and talked under the palm trees in the hall, expressing their desire for friendship. Everyone frequently raised their glasses, using different languages to congratulate the great unity of the world's working class and to celebrate world peace.

    Liu Changsheng, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the beginning of the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the trade union representatives from various countries on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. He said: The international situation has undergone tremendous changes. "The East wind prevails over the West wind," and the cause of socialism and peace has never been as prosperous as it is today. Chinese workers and people are striving hard to build our country into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and technology. We are determined to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer.

    Liu Changsheng also said: It is already very clear that the socialist system leads working people onto the road of happiness, while the capitalist system drives working people into a quagmire of suffering and anxiety. The powerful socialist forces are the most reliable guarantee of world peace. For the victory of socialism, for the progress of mankind, and for world peace, Liu Changsheng expressed his sincere hope to further strengthen the unity and cooperation of the working class in Asia, Africa and the world, and to continuously enhance the friendly relations between trade union organizations of various countries.
