　　This newspaper reports: China's rural hydropower development has taken a great leap forward this year. To date, the generating capacity of rural hydropower stations that various regions plan to build this year has exceeded 900,000 kilowatts, while the rural generating capacity in 1957 was only over 20,000 kilowatts. Sichuan Province has started construction or completed more than 600 small hydropower stations in the past two months. Anhui Province has completed 124 rural small hydropower stations, and another 223 hydropower stations are under construction. Yongchun County, Fujian Province, plans to build 260 rural hydropower and water power stations this year, aiming to provide electricity to one in four households, with preliminary mechanization and electrification of grain processing.
　　In the process of building small rural hydropower stations, all regions have adhered to the principles of using local materials, making use of simple resources, and progressing from simple to complex. The masses in various parts of Sichuan have creatively used bamboo and wood instead of steel, bamboo tubes instead of porcelain tubes, and live trees instead of electric poles. Anhui Province has extensively adopted wooden water turbines. The vast majority of rural hydropower stations are funded by the masses themselves, with the state only providing a small amount of loans. This can greatly speed up construction and reduce construction investment. Most of the hydropower stations built in various parts of Sichuan first build water power stations for processing grain and feed, and then gradually install generators and develop diversified operations after accumulating funds. The advantages of doing so are low investment, simple technology, ease of construction, and quick results.
　　After these hydropower stations are completed, they can replace heavy manual labor such as water drawing, rice milling, and flour grinding with cheap kinetic energy, and also invigorate rural cultural life. Residents of Zhaocheng Town, Hongzhao County, Shanxi Province, used to have to carry or transport flour to water mills more than 20 miles away, which was estimated to consume more than 20,000 workdays per year. In 1957, they built a 40-kilowatt hydropower station and installed three electric mills, solving a problem that had been unsolved for many years. Yongchun County, Fujian Province, has completed sixteen hydropower stations and twenty-one water power stations. It is estimated that about 600,000 workdays can be saved throughout the year to be invested in agricultural production. The Penghu Hydropower Joint Factory in this county operates more than 30 processing side businesses, forming the center of a local comprehensive small industry. Luozigou Township, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, is a remote mountainous area. After the hydropower station was built, electric lights and loudspeakers were installed, and electric lights were also installed in farmers' night schools, which greatly enlivened cultural life.
　　This newspaper reports: The number of large and medium-sized hydropower stations above the quota planned to be built in China this year has increased from the original 20 to 27, and there are currently nine more being prepared for addition. Thus, there will be 36 large and medium-sized hydropower stations under construction nationwide. At present, the main projects of 16 of these 36 hydropower stations are under formal construction. Some of the others have begun laying traffic lines, allocating materials, or other equipment work; some are organizing construction forces to establish preparatory institutions. It is expected that during the dry season this winter, these hydropower stations can formally excavate dam foundations or build factory buildings.
　　These hydropower stations are distributed in nineteen provinces and autonomous regions such as Zhejiang, Sichuan, Anhui, and Hubei. Among them, in addition to the nine large hydropower stations with equipment generating capacity of more than 200,000 kilowatts, such as the Sanmenxia in Henan, the Liujiaxia in Gansu, the Huanren in Liaoning, the Zhexi in Hunan, the Xinfengjiang in Guangdong, and the Zhaoping in Guangxi, most of the others are medium-sized hydropower stations with a generating capacity of tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of kilowatts. Five hydropower stations also plan to use existing or soon-to-be-built reservoirs for power generation. Therefore, the construction workload of these medium-sized hydropower stations is small, and they can generate electricity next year.
　　Recently, the workers responsible for the construction of various hydropower stations have also launched a competition to "shorten the construction period and strive for early power generation." According to the leap forward plans proposed by the workers, more than a dozen hydropower stations, such as the Xin'anjiang in Zhejiang, the Huanren in Liaoning which has not yet started construction, the Zhexi in Hunan, and the Zipingpu in Guizhou, can start generating electricity one to two years ahead of the original plan. The construction cost of each hydropower station will also be greatly reduced.

### 要把国民经济转到现代化的技术基础上　我国开始向电气化迈进　今年农村小型水电站发电能力将达90万瓩，新建大中型水电站达36个

　　要把国民经济转到现代化的技术基础上
　　我国开始向电气化迈进
　　今年农村小型水电站发电能力将达90万瓩，新建大中型水电站达36个
    本报讯　我国农村水力发电事业，今年迈开了大跃进的步伐。到现在为止，各地准备今年兴建的农村水电站的发电能力已超过九十万瓩，而1957年的农村发电能力只有两万多瓩。四川省最近两个月来已动工和完工的小型水电站有六百多个。安徽省已建成一百二十四座农村小型水电站，还有二百二十三座水电站正在建设。福建省永春县今年就准备修建农村水电、水力站二百六十处，作到四户中有一户有电灯，粮食加工初步机械化、电气化。
    各地在建设农村小型水电站的过程中，都本着就地取材、因陋就简、从简到繁的原则。四川各地群众创造用竹、木代替钢材，用竹筒代替瓷管，生树代替电杆。安徽省大量采用木制水轮机。绝大部分农村水电站都是由群众自筹资金，国家只发放了很少的贷款。这样可大大加快建设速度和降低建设的投资。四川各地兴建的水电站绝大部分采取先建成水力站，加工粮食、饲料，待积累资金后再逐步安装发电机，开展多种经营。这样做的好处是投资少、技术简单、易于修建、收效快。
    这些水电站建成后，可用廉价的动能代替车水、碾米、磨面等繁重的体力劳动，并且使农村的文化生活活跃起来。山西洪赵县赵城镇居民，过去吃面需要肩挑、车拉运到二十里以外去用水磨加工，每年估计要耗费劳动日两万个以上。1957年他们建成一座四十瓩的水电站，安了三盘电磨，解决了多少年来不能解决的问题。福建永春县已建成水电站十六座、水力站二十一座，据估算全年约可节省六十万个劳动日来投入农业生产。这个县的蓬壶水电联合工厂共经营三十多项加工副业，形成了地方综合小工业的中心。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州罗子沟乡是偏僻的山区，建成水电站后，装上了电灯，安上了扩音器，农民夜校也安上了电灯，大大活跃了文化生活。
    本报讯　今年我国计划兴建的限额以上的大中型水电站，已由原定的二十个增加到二十七个，目前正准备增加的还有九个。这样全国将有三十六个大中型水电站进行建设。现在，这三十六个水电站中有十六个水电站的主体工程已在正式施工。其余有的已开始敷设交通轨线、调拨材料或其他设备工作；有的正在组织施工力量建立筹建机构。预计在今年冬季进入枯水期间，这些水电站都可以正式开挖坝基或建设厂房。
    这批水电站分别分布在浙江、四川、安徽、湖北等十九个省和自治区。其中除了河南的三门峡、甘肃的刘家峡、辽宁的桓仁、湖南的柘溪、广东的新丰江、广西的昭平等九个水电站是设备发电能力在二十万瓩以上的大水电站外，其余多数是发电能力几万瓩到十几万瓩的中型水电站。有五个水电站还计划利用原有的或即将建成的水库发电。因此，这些中型水电站的建筑工程量小，而且在明年就能发电。
    最近，担负各水电站施工建设的职工也都开展了“缩短工期、争取提前发电”的竞赛。根据职工们提出的跃进计划，浙江的新安江、辽宁的还未开工的桓仁、湖南的柘溪、贵州的紫坪铺等十多个水电站，都可以比原定计划提前一年到二年开始发电。各水电站的建筑造价也将大大降低。
