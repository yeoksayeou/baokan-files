Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, May 9th: The Zhejiang Provincial Association for the Popularization of Science and Technology recently put forward the slogan "Production goes there, popular science work follows there," determined to work hard for three years to popularize scientific and technological knowledge among young and middle-aged people and workers and cadres throughout the province, so that science and technology can take root among the masses.

They will use three methods, under the leadership of the local Party committee and in cooperation with relevant parties, to ensure that the popularization of science and technology goes deep into the masses and serves the agricultural technology revolution: The first method is to widely run agricultural technology night schools. This year, all 36,000 agricultural cooperatives in the province are required to run such night schools, enrolling one million agricultural cooperative core members and members. At present, more than 2,000 agricultural technology night schools have been established in nine counties including Xiaoshan, Wuxing, Fuyang, and Kaihua. The second method is to establish mass scientific and technological research groups. This year, every cooperative and every team with the conditions is required to establish such a group, whose task is to research, improve, create, and learn production technology and production tools, and to popularize and promote them through experiments and demonstrations. The third method is cadres' experimental fields, workshops, and other various training classes.

At present, cadres' experimental fields, training classes, and technical research groups are being established in batches. Before April 14, Lanxi County had established cadres' experimental fields and workshops in every township; at the same time, it had established 118 technical research groups. Haining County has established 16 cadres' training classes, with 480 cadres participating in the study. Jiangshan County has established seven cadres' Red and Expert Night Schools. Cadres' training classes are generally organized by township, and classes are held once or twice a week according to the needs of experimental field cultivation and production leadership. After class, they study production work together, which is very popular among cadres.

    生产到那里　科普工作跟到那里
    浙江将广泛地举办农业技术夜校，建立群众性的科学技术研究小组，在全省普及科学技术知识
    据新华社杭州9日电　浙江省科学技术普及协会最近提出了“生产搞到那里，科普工作跟到那里”的口号，决心苦战三年，在全省青壮年和职工干部中普及科学技术知识，使科学技术在群众中生根。
    他们将通过三种方式，在地方党委的领导下，和有关方面合作，使科学技术普及工作深入到群众中去，为农业技术革命服务：第一种方式是广泛地举办农业技术夜校。今年要求全省三万六千个农业社都举办这样的夜校，吸收农业社骨干和社员一百万人入学。现在萧山、吴兴、富阳、开化等九个县已经建立农业技术夜校两千多所。第二种方式是建立群众性的科学技术研究小组。今年要求每一个社和每一个有条件的队都建立这样的小组，它的任务是研究改进、创造和学习生产技术、生产工具，通过试验示范普及推广。第三种方式是干部的试验田、讲习班和其他各种学习班。
    现在，干部试验田、学习班和技术研究小组都正在成批地建立起来。兰溪县在4月14日前，已乡乡办起干部试验田、讲习班；同时已经建立了技术研究小组一百一十八个。海宁县已办干部学习班十六所，参加学习的干部有四百八十人。江山县已办七所干部红专夜校，干部学习班一般以乡为单位组织，根据试验田耕作和领导生产的需要，每周上课一次到两次。上课后就一起研究生产工作，很受干部欢迎。
