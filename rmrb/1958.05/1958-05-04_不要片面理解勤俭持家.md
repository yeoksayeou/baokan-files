Do Not Understand Diligence and Frugality in Managing a Household One-Sidedly
Xiao Zhe
    In the great leap forward of the whole people, "unwilling to lag behind" is human nature. So, we must fight hard: compare our work with the advanced, fearing to fall behind; squeeze time to read more books. As a result, for a long time, I didn't go to the store to take a look. Recently, it was time to buy single-layer clothes for the children, so I took them to the store on Sunday. The store really felt like "a day apart is like three autumns." There were many new goods, some of which could be considered good quality and low price. Because it was a holiday, many people were picking and choosing there, and I also picked some at random, and unknowingly spent more than twenty yuan.
    Some time ago, a friend in the commercial system made some remarks to me, saying: Producers are making a great leap forward, producing more; consumers should be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, buying less. In this way, aren't their two aspects of the leap forward going to make our commercial sector regress instead?
    At first, I felt that this made a lot of sense. It was because of this experience that I realized that my friend's concerns were superfluous, because first, he did not see the strong potential of our national sales market, and, at present, there is no danger of product surplus in our country. There are probably many people like me who haven't been to the store for many days, and buy a lot of things when they go once! Second, he only thinks that consumption can promote production, but he doesn't know that production can also promote consumption. When people have purchasing power in their hands, they will always buy some when they see a large number of good things that they like and need. Among the things I bought, in addition to the very necessary ones, there were also some new products from the leap forward in the light industry sector, which I bought because I especially liked them.
    However, my friend's words still have their merits. If we only understand diligence and frugality in managing a household one-sidedly, and emphasize that everyone should try not to buy consumer goods, it may create a false temporary stagnation in the sales market. Because, most of the people living in our society have such a consciousness. As long as they hear that a certain commodity is temporarily in short supply and should not be bought, they will temporarily restrain their needs without feeling bitter in order to build socialism.
    From this, I remembered the discussion "Is This Wasteful?" in the supplement of the People's Daily. That discussion advocated that people should be diligent and simple, live frugally, and especially that people should correctly understand the relationship between developing production and improving life, and pay attention to the overall arrangement of life consumption and daily savings, which is correct, and indeed has a considerable educational significance for those who "only care about today and not tomorrow." However, many people in the discussion emphasized that buying personal daily necessities is also wasteful, which is another one-sidedness. The trend of ostentation and extravagance must be opposed, and the style of hard work, simplicity, diligence, and thrift should of course be promoted. However, there should be a principled distinction between normal living needs and waste. Extravagance in life, casual waste of things, such as scattering grain, etc., should be regarded as waste. If the income is high, buying a little more daily necessities, I don't think it can be regarded as waste.
    Of course, people with particularly high incomes should be aware that they should not let their lives deviate too far from the living standards of the working masses, which will cause personal detachment from the masses, and over time, may also cause ideological degeneration; but people's living standards cannot be required to be uniformly average, as if a minimum standard can be set, and whoever exceeds it is considered extravagant and wasteful!
    When life is still difficult, we must be able to be content with poverty, and not slacken our will because of life difficulties; and we must not use bad means to pursue a life that is beyond our ability. However, it is also reasonable for people with higher incomes to have more living consumption than those with lower incomes. As for a worker buying something for personal use, it cannot be regarded as extravagance and waste, otherwise, wouldn't the principle of distribution according to work lose its practical significance?
    Regarding the purchase of personal consumer goods, I think it should be like this: buy what is needed and possible; what is needed but not possible can be temporarily not bought, and bought when it becomes possible; what is possible but not needed must not be bought. Someone mentioned "don't buy what you can buy or not buy." I think that if there is such a need in personal life, but it is not very urgent, you can buy it or not buy it. If you have extra money on hand, and the current supply of this commodity is sufficient, you can buy it; otherwise, don't buy it. Don't borrow money to buy things that are not very necessary, and don't compete with everyone to buy things that are not very necessary. This is both in line with diligence and frugality in managing a household and in line with the principle of collectivism. Absolutely not buying what you can buy or not buy may not be beneficial to social production.
    In short, the amount of people's living needs can and should increase with the increase of social commodity quantity and the increase of personal income, which is a normal phenomenon in social life. Production and consumption are a unity of opposites, which are mutually restrictive and mutually promoting. Therefore, we should advocate such a comprehensive view: everyone can buy what they can afford to buy according to their needs, to maintain the constant activity in the commodity circulation field, to benefit production. At the same time, they can consciously restrain their living requirements temporarily when the supply of goods is tight, so that the people who need this commodity the most can get the supply. This is a comprehensive attitude towards diligence and frugality in managing a household and living frugally.

    不要片面理解勤俭持家
    萧哲
    在全民的大跃进中，“不甘落后”，是人之常情了。于是要苦战：工作要同先进的比，唯恐落后；挤时间还要多读点儿书。这样一来，有很长一个时间，就没有到商店里去看看。最近，该给孩子们买单衣了，才趁星期日，带他们到商店里去了。商店里真是“一日不见，如隔三秋”的样子。新货物不少，其中有些算得上是物美价廉。由于是假日吧，熙熙攘攘不少人在那里挑来拣去，我也随手拣了些，不知不觉便花去了二十多块钱。
    前些时候，商业系统的一个朋友，曾对我发过一些感慨，他说：生产者方面大跃进，要多产；消费者方面要勤俭持家，少买。这样一来，不是人家两方面跃进，反而要我们商业方面跃退了吗？
    起初觉着这很有点道理，由于这次的见识，才使我明白了这位朋友的顾虑是多余的，因为第一，他没有看到我们国家销售市场上的雄厚潜力，而且，目前我们国家，并不存在产品过剩的危险。像我这样，因为多日不进商店，去一次就买许多东西的人大概不少吧！第二，他只认为消费可以促进生产，却不知生产也可以促进消费，购买力握在人们手里，见到有大量自己喜爱而又需要的好东西时，总归是要买些的。我买的东西中，除了十分必需的以外，也就有一些是轻工业部门跃进中新出的产品，由于特别喜爱才买的。
    但是，这位朋友的话总还有它的一面道理。如果我们对勤俭持家只作片面的理解，把这强调成大家尽量都不去买消费品，便有可能造成一个销售市场上的虚假的暂时的迟滞。因为，生活在我们这个社会里的人，大多是有这样一种自觉性的。只要听说某种货物暂时供应较紧、不宜去买时，为了建设社会主义，也会暂时克制自己的需求而不觉其苦的。
    由此，我记起了人民日报副刊上曾有一次“这是浪费吗？”的讨论。那次讨论，提倡人们勤劳朴素，精打细算过日子，特别是要人们正确认识发展生产和改善生活的关系，注意生活消费和日常积蓄的全面安排，这是正确的，对那些“只顾今天不顾明天”的人，确实有不小教育意义。但是，讨论里有不少人把个人买点日用品也强调说是浪费，就未免成了另一个片面。讲排场比阔气的风气必须反对，艰苦朴素勤劳节俭的风气当然应该提倡。但是，正常的生活需要同浪费应该有一个原则的区别。生活上的挥霍无度，随便的糟蹋东西，比如抛撒粮食等等应视作浪费，如果收入较多，多买了一点日用物品，我看是不能算作浪费的。
    当然，收入特多的人应该自觉，不要使自己生活太远地脱离劳动群众的生活水平，这样会造成个人同群众的脱离，久之，还有可能造成思想上的蜕化；但是人们生活的水平，不能要求一律平均，好像可以订出一个最低的标准来，谁要是超过了它谁就算铺张浪费！
    在生活还艰苦的时候，我们要能安于贫，不因生活困难而懈怠意志；更不能用不良手段去追求那种力不从心的生活。但是，收入较多的人，比收入少的人多一点生活消费，也还合理。至于一个劳动者买了点个人需用的东西，就更不能看作是铺张浪费，否则按劳取值的分配原则岂不也就失去了实际意义？
    对于个人生活消费品的购买，我以为应该这样：需要而又可能的就买；需要而不可能的可先不买，等到有了可能时再买；可能而不需要的坚决不买。有人提到“可买可不买的不买”。我倒认为如果个人生活上有这种需要、但又不是十分紧迫的话，可以买也可以不买。如果手边有多余的钱，而这种商品当前的供应量又很充足，就可以买；否则，就不买。既不要借债去买不十分必需的东西，又不要同大家去争购不十分必需的东西。这是既合乎勤俭持家又合乎集体主义原则的。可买可不买的绝对不买，未必就对社会生产有利。
    总之，人的生活需要量，可以而且应该随着社会商品量的增长，个人收入的增长而增长，这是社会生活中的正常现象。生产和消费是对立的统一，是彼此制约而又彼此促进的。因此，应该提倡这样一种全面的观点：每个人能够根据自己的需要去购买自己可能购买到的东西，以保持商品流通领域里的经常活跃，以利生产。同时，又能自觉地在商品供应紧张时，暂时克制自己的生活要求，以便使对这种商品最必需的人，能够得到供应。这才是全面的对待勤俭持家和生活节俭的态度。
