My Thoughts on "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy"
　　Shu Xiuwen

　　The heroic struggles of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are a subject that our literary and artistic fields need to reflect on for a long time. It is precisely because of the heroic struggles of the People's Liberation Army that we are able to step into the era of the Great Leap Forward today. When drinking water, we must think of its source. While living a happy life, we cannot help but remember those intense struggles of the past. The Beijing People's Art Theatre's performance of "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" (adapted from "Tracks in the Snowy Forest") is a story about the heroic deeds of the People's Liberation Army.

　　As soon as the curtain opened, the scene on the stage caught my attention: on the kang, there was a strange couple. The man had a hideous face, eating and drinking voraciously, and the woman didn't seem like his wife, but she was under his control; a pair of old people were huddled together in fear, sitting on small stools. Dim light shone on these four people, creating an atmosphere of terror. Later, this strange man seized a picture of some kind that the woman had hidden on her person, killed her, and fled in a hurry. The old couple also quickly turned off the lights and hid in the quilt. At this time, a team of People's Liberation Army soldiers came on stage, and they began to investigate this mysterious incident: Who was the person who fled? Who was the person who was killed? What kind of picture was taken, and what was its use? How was there also a Taoist mixed in? What exactly was going on? My heart also began to "investigate" together with the resourceful and courageous People's Liberation Army soldiers.

　　The development of the play shows us that this struggle is not only about wits but also about courage. It shows us that having wit without courage is not enough, and having courage without wit is also not enough. And having both wit and courage is not the only condition for victory; what is more important is to connect with the masses and rely on the masses. In this play, the People's Liberation Army's sharing of clothing and food and genuine concern for the lives of the masses, although only depicted in a few strokes, already makes it clear that this is the most important foundation for the People's Liberation Army's victory.

　　Similarly, with only a few strokes, we also see the class relations that are the foundation of all foundations in the play. Li Yongqi, who had suffered from the ravages of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang armed forces, initially had some misunderstandings about the People's Liberation Army. However, when the People's Liberation Army learned that he was a worker and he also learned that the People's Liberation Army was the army of the working class, they quickly understood each other and became brothers. Class relations were the foundation of their common struggle and mutual assistance. This episode was presented vividly on the stage, making it very moving to watch.

　　The People's Liberation Army and the bandits, both in appearance and in action, are in stark contrast. The reactionary bandit gang's brutality, ugliness, and stupidity precisely set off the People's Liberation Army's solemnity, wit, and optimism. This contrasting description adds a lot of comedy to this dramatic and tense play.

　　All nine scenes of the play can be said to be preparing for the final scene. The ninth scene reaches the climax of the battle of wits and courage. The play reaches this point, and it is truly one wave after another, step by step. Yang Zirong, a People's Liberation Army hero with unparalleled courage, disguises himself and goes deep into the tiger's den, fighting the bandits alone. Just when the great feat is about to be accomplished, unexpectedly, one cunning and terrifying enemy after another appears. Finally, when he is exposed by the enemy and has to take out the grenades tied to his body, preparing to die together with the enemy, the People's Liberation Army soldiers and militiamen, who are marching towards the bandit's nest overnight, rush into the Tiger Hall. The enemies are captured, and the cry of "Long live the Communist Party" resounds through the clouds!

　　The novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" is very familiar to the audience. Recently, on the Beijing stage, in addition to drama, there are also Peking opera and Ping opera adapted from the same story being performed. However, when we watch this drama, we are still tightly captivated by it. I think this is because this is not an ordinary thriller; it describes the life-and-death struggle of our People's Army under the leadership of the Party for the liberation of the Chinese people. That is why this play can capture my heart so much!

　　我看“智取威虎山”
　　舒绣文
    中国人民解放军英勇的斗争事迹，是我们文艺领域里需要长时期反映的题材。正是由于人民解放军的英勇斗争，我们今天才有可能跨进大跃进的时代。饮水思源，在我们过着幸福生活的时候，我们不能不缅怀过去的这些激烈斗争。北京人民艺术剧院演出的“智取威虎山”（根据“林海雪原”改编），就是一个写人民解放军的英雄事迹的故事。
    戏幕一拉开，舞台上的情景就吸引了我的注意：炕上有一对奇怪的人，男的面目狰狞，一个人在那儿大喝大嚼，女的不像他的老婆，但又受着他的控制；一对老人吓得缩作一团地坐在小板凳上。暗淡的灯光照着这四个人，造成一种恐怖的气氛。后来这个怪男人夺取了女人藏在身边的一幅什么图，把她杀死后匆匆地逃走了。这一对老人也连忙熄了灯，躲进被窝。在这时候一队人民解放军上场了，他们开始向这个谜一样的事件展开侦查：逃走的人是谁？被杀的人又是谁？夺走的是什么图，有什么用处？怎么中间还夹杂了一个道人？这一切究竟是怎么一回事？我的心也开始跟着智勇双全的解放军战士一起进行“侦察”了。
    戏的发展，使我们首先看到的是这场斗争不仅是斗智，也是斗勇。使我们看到有智无勇不行，有勇无智也不行。而有智有勇还不是致胜的唯一条件，更重要的是联系群众，依靠群众。在这出戏中，解放军的解衣推食，真正对群众生活的关心，虽然只有几笔描写，但已使人看出，这才是解放军取胜的最重要的基础。
    同样是几笔描写，还使我们在戏里看到一切基础之基础的阶级关系。受过日伪和国民党武装残害的李勇奇最初对于解放军有所误解，可是，当解放军知道他是工人而他也知道了解放军是工人阶级的军队时，他们很快就互相了解，结成兄弟了。阶级关系是他们共同斗争、相互帮助的基础。这一段事迹在舞台上表现得有声有色，使人看了十分感动。
    解放军和匪贼，无论是在外形上，在行动上，都成鲜明的对照。反动匪帮的凶残、丑恶、愚蠢，正衬托出人民解放军的严正、机智、乐观。这种对照的描写，使这个剧情曲折紧张的戏，增加了不少喜剧的色彩。
    全剧九场戏，可以说前八场戏都是为了最后一场戏做准备的。第九戏场达到了斗智斗勇的高潮，戏演到这里，真是一波未平，一波又起，一步紧一步。一身是胆的解放军英雄杨子荣，化装深入虎穴，独战群匪，在大功快要告成的时候，出于意料之外，却来了一个又一个狡猾可怕的敌人，最后，当他被敌人识破真面目不得不拿出缚在身上的手榴弹来，准备和敌人同归于尽的时候，连夜向匪巢进军的解放军战士和民兵却冲进了威虎厅。敌人束手就擒，“共产党万岁”的呼声响彻云霄！
    小说“林海雪原”是观众很熟悉的。最近在北京舞台上，除了话剧，还有根据相同故事改编的京剧和评剧在上演。但是，我们在看这出话剧的时候，仍然被它紧紧扣住心弦。我想：这是因为这不是一出普通的惊险戏，这里描写了我们的人民军队在党的领导下为解放中国人民进行着生死的斗争。所以这个戏才能如此抓住我的心！
