Rescue Rouzbeh's Life!

The life of Khosrow Rouzbeh, a renowned Iranian patriot, is in danger. According to reports from Tehran, the Iranian authorities plan to carry out the illegal death sentence of February 25th in the coming days, executing Rouzbeh. This decision by the Iranian authorities cannot but shock and anger all honest people!

Rouzbeh is a loyal son of the Iranian people. He dedicated his life and energy to the cause of Iranian national independence, peace, and democracy. He fought for the freedom and happiness of the Iranian people for a long time. He is loved by the Iranian people and respected by peace-loving people in various countries. He should live! He should be free! However, the Iranian authorities arrested him on trumped-up charges, tortured him, tormented him, and illegally sentenced him to death. Moreover, despite the unanimous protests from all sectors of the Iranian people and world public opinion against this illegal verdict by the Iranian authorities, and the widespread calls not to persecute Rouzbeh, the Iranian authorities turned a deaf ear and instead attempted to execute Rouzbeh. This shows that the Iranian authorities are still unwilling to abandon their perverse actions of undermining democracy and suppressing patriots. This will only be met with even stronger condemnation from all honest people.

Since Iran has been under the control of imperialist oil consortia and joined the Baghdad Pact, Iran's national crisis has deepened day by day. The common demand of every patriotic Iranian is to strengthen national unity, oppose imperialist aggression and plunder, and defend their national independence and national interests. Rouzbeh is precisely an outstanding fighter among the thousands of Iranian patriots. Therefore, it is very clear that killing Rouzbeh and suppressing patriots will only be applauded by imperialism and further worsen Iran's situation.

The Chinese people express deep concern for the plight of the Iranian people and the struggle of Iranian patriots. Together with the people of all countries in the world, we strongly protest the inhumane behavior of the Iranian authorities in persecuting Rouzbeh and firmly demand the cancellation of the death sentence against Rouzbeh. All honest people and international public opinion should rise up to rescue Rouzbeh's life!

    援救鲁兹贝赫的生命！
    伊朗著名爱国者霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫的生命已处于危险中。据德黑兰消息，伊朗当局计划在最近几天执行2月25日的非法判决，把鲁兹贝赫处死。伊朗当局的这个决定不能不引起一切正直人们的震动和愤怒！
    鲁兹贝赫是伊朗人民的忠实儿子，他把自己的生活和精力献给了伊朗的民族独立与和平民主事业。他为了争取伊朗人民的自由幸福，进行了长期的斗争。他受到伊朗人民的爱戴，也受到各国爱好和平人们的尊敬。他应该活下去！他应该得到自由！但是，伊朗当局竟以莫须有的罪名，逮捕他，拷打他，折磨他，并且非法判处他的死刑。而且，尽管伊朗各界人民和世界舆论一致抗议伊朗当局的这个非法的判决，到处发出了不许迫害鲁兹贝赫的呼声，伊朗当局仍然充耳不闻，反而企图把鲁兹贝赫处死。这说明伊朗当局仍然不肯放弃它的摧残民主和镇压爱国人士的倒行逆施。这只会受到一切正直人们的更强烈的谴责。
    自从伊朗处于帝国主义石油财团的控制之下，并且加入了巴格达条约以来，伊朗的民族危机是日益深重了。每一个爱国的伊朗人民的共同要求是，加强民族团结，反对帝国主义的侵略和掠夺，保卫自己的民族独立和民族利益。鲁兹贝赫，正就是千千万万伊朗爱国者当中的一个杰出的战士。因此，事情非常明白，杀害鲁兹贝赫，镇压爱国人士，只会受到帝国主义的喝采，而使伊朗的处境更加恶化。
    中国人民对于伊朗人民的处境，对于伊朗爱国者的斗争，表示深切关怀。我们同世界各国人民一道，强烈抗议伊朗当局迫害鲁兹贝赫的非人道行为，坚决要求取消对鲁兹贝赫判处的死刑。一切正直人士和国际舆论都应该起来援救鲁兹贝赫的生命！
