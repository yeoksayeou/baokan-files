Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 2nd: The Southern Thirteen Provinces and Cities Local Transportation Work Symposium convened by the Ministry of Communications in Wuhan concluded on April 30th.

This symposium focused mainly on "discussing theory," combining theory with practice, summarizing the transportation work of the past eight years, and discussing the future development plan for the transportation industry. Wang Shoudao, Minister of Communications, proposed at the symposium that the future direction of transportation development is: "The whole party and all the people run transportation, a great leap forward in technological revolution, comprehensive development of water, land, and air, and nationwide communication of the transportation network."

The situation introduced by the representatives of the provinces showed that the leap-forward development of industrial and agricultural production and the technological revolution in agriculture both require a great leap forward in transportation work, especially in remote areas and mountainous areas where transportation is inconvenient, the demand is even more urgent. Under the leadership of the local Party committees, many areas have already seen a high tide of the masses reforming transportation. The broad masses of agricultural cooperative members are building vehicles for several days and nights without sleeping, repairing roads with lanterns and torches, and creating many miracles that were previously unimaginable. The experience introduced at the meeting by Pao Ma Township, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, on fully mobilizing the masses to realize vehicle transportation in three days, Lichuan County's introduction of adapting to local conditions and using local materials to implement major reforms in mountain transportation and eliminate carrying by shoulder and back, as well as the experience of Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan and other provinces in improving folk transportation tools, fully proved that as long as we rely on the leadership of the local Party committee and the wisdom and enthusiasm of the masses, many things that were previously considered impossible can be achieved. Many experiences have also proved that relying on local authorities to run transportation is much faster and more economical than professional departments working in isolation.

The representatives criticized the past erroneous thinking of only believing in directly subordinate units, not believing in the localities; only believing in professional construction forces, not believing in the masses; only coveting high standards and modernization, while ignoring the popularization of transportation and being divorced from the masses. It was clarified that in order to do a good job in transportation and meet objective needs, it is necessary to actively implement the "local, mass, popularization" transportation construction policy of relying on the localities, relying on the masses, and focusing on popularization.

The representatives also used many facts to sharply criticize the dogmatism of the leading departments, such as mechanically copying books, and many regulations and systems that were formulated were divorced from reality, causing waste and losses. Everyone believes that it is necessary to break through the shackles of this kind of dogmatism, emancipate the mind, and give play to the spirit of originality in order to implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results, and going all out, aiming high and achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results, and accelerating transportation construction.

Because the transportation methods of carrying by shoulder and back are still restricting hundreds of millions of laborers, everyone unanimously believes that the current direction of technological revolution in the transportation sector must focus on popularization, gradually improve on the basis of popularization, rely on the masses, and boldly create. In areas where carrying by shoulder and back has not been eliminated, the problem of motorization must be solved first. In areas where motorization has been achieved, further improvements must be made, and various types of vehicles must be displayed for the masses to identify, concentrate on the advantages, and finalize the design for promotion.

While determining the future transportation development plan, the meeting focused on studying the current transportation problems, and unanimously believed that although this year's transportation tasks are very tight, they all have the confidence to complete them. Sichuan and Guizhou provinces jointly proposed an initiative to work hard for one year and three years respectively to achieve the "300,000 annual production per vehicle, and a further 33% reduction in costs" proposed by the Ministry of Communications (that is, requiring a Jiefang brand truck, including a trailer, to transport 300,000 ton-kilometers per year, and the cost of truck transportation should be reduced by 33% compared to 1957). All provinces responded one after another, and challenged and accepted each other, and all announced their leap forward plans and measures at the meeting.

The thirteen provinces and cities participating in this symposium were Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Fujian, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai. Zeng Shan, Minister of the Transportation Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, attended the meeting and spoke at the meeting. Units such as the State Planning Commission and the Economic Commission also sent representatives to participate in the symposium. (Attached picture)

After the realization of the wide road network in Zhenyuan County, Guizhou Province, every commune has access to highways, and every team has access to roads, and the transportation rate has increased by three to fourteen times.

### 依靠地方、依靠群众、普及为主  全党全民办交通事业  南方十三省、市代表确定今后交通发展规划

    依靠地方、依靠群众、普及为主
    全党全民办交通事业
    南方十三省、市代表确定今后交通发展规划
    新华社武汉2日电　交通部在武汉召开的南方十三省、市地方交通工作座谈会，在4月30日结束。
    这次座谈会以“论虚”为主，虚实结合，总结了八年来的交通工作，并且讨论了交通运输业今后的发展规划。交通部部长王首道在座谈会上提出，今后交通运输业发展的方向是：“全党全民办交通，技术革命大跃进，水陆空综合发展，运输网全国沟通。”
    各省代表介绍的情况说明，工农业生产的飞跃发展和农业上的技术革命，都要求交通工作来个大跃进，特别是交通不便的偏僻地区和山区，要求更为迫切。不少地区在当地党委领导下，已经出现了群众改革交通运输的高潮，广大农业社员几日几夜不睡觉地造车子，打着灯笼、火把修路，创造了很多过去想像不到的奇迹。会上湖北省当阳县跑马乡介绍的充分发动群众，三天车子化，利川县介绍的因地制宜、就地取材，实行山区交通大改革，消灭肩挑人背，以及四川、贵州、湖南等省介绍的改良民间运输工具的经验，都充分证明了只要依靠地方党委领导、依靠群众的智慧和干劲，很多过去认为做不到的事情都能做到。很多经验还证明，依靠地方办交通比专业部门孤立的干要快得多和省得多。
    代表们批判了过去只相信直属单位，不相信地方；只相信专业建设力量，不相信群众；只贪图高标准、近代化，而忽视普及交通的脱离群众的错误思想。明确了要想做好交通工作，满足客观需要，必需积极贯彻依靠地方、依靠群众、普及为主的“地、群、普”的交通建设方针。
    代表们还用许多事实尖锐地批评了领导部门的教条主义，如生搬硬套书本，订立的许多规章制度脱离实际，造成浪费和损失。大家认为必须冲破这种教条主义的束缚，解放思想，发挥独创精神，才能贯彻多快好省、鼓起干劲、力争上游的建设路线，加速交通建设。
    由于目前肩挑人背的运输方式还束缚着成千上万的劳动力，大家一致认为交通部门目前技术革命的方向必须以普及为主，在普及的基础上逐步提高，依靠群众，大胆创造。在未消灭肩挑人背的地区，首先要解决车子化的问题，已实现运输车子化的地区，要进一步加以提高，把各种车型摆出来让群众鉴定，集中优点，定型推广。
    会议在确定今后交通发展规划的同时，着重研究了当前的运输问题，一致认为今年的运输任务虽然十分紧张，但都有信心完成。四川、贵州两省联合提出倡议，决心苦战一年和三年分别实现交通部提出的“单车年产三十万，成本再降三十三”（就是要求一辆解放牌汽车包括拖带挂车，一年要运输三十万吨公里，汽车运输成本要比1957年降低33％。）的要求。各省纷纷响应，并互相提出挑战、应战，都在会上宣布了跃进规划和措施。
    参加这次座谈会的十三个省市是湖北、江西、湖南、广东、广西、云南、贵州、四川、福建、浙江、江苏、安徽、上海。中共中央交通工作部部长曾山参加了这次会议，并在会上讲了话。国家计划委员会、经济委员会等单位，也派代表参加了座谈会。（附图片）
