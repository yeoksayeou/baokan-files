Produce Whatever Agriculture Needs
Zhang Yumei, First Secretary of the Xingtai County Party Committee, Hebei Province

Xingtai County is located in the southern part of Hebei Province, a county with more mountains and less plains. The mountainous area has four large rivers and two major rivers, with less land; the area around the county seat is a plain with fertile land. Since last winter and this spring, the people of Xingtai County have experienced a surge of "great ideological leap forward, great leap forward for everyone, and great leap forward in production." With heroic spirit, the 250,000 people of the county launched a fierce attack on nature. The county's slogan is: Fight hard for one year to change the face of nature, realize six modernizations, eight transformations, and three upsurges. The six modernizations are: agricultural water conservancy, afforestation of barren hills, terracing of slopes, high yields of crops, rural electrification, and prosperity for every commune reaching the level of a well-to-do middle peasant. The eight transformations are: turning water disasters into water conservancy, turning poverty into prosperity, turning bald mountains into green mountains, turning poor land into good land, turning rough cultivation into intensive cultivation, turning inferior seeds into improved seeds, turning the four pests into the four no’s (no rats, no sparrows, no flies, no mosquitoes), and turning weak livestock into strong livestock. The three upsurges are: an upsurge in ideological leap forward, an upsurge in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation, and an upsurge in production competition. After half a year of day and night hard work, miracles have been created and great achievements have been made on all fronts.

What problems did the great leap forward in agricultural production bring?

First, the problem of insufficient labor. Due to the overall leap forward in agricultural production, a shortage of labor has occurred in all aspects. In order to achieve water conservancy throughout the county, 2,000 small and medium-sized reservoirs, more than 600 canals, 40,000 water cellars, 1,000 wells, and 500 pits and ponds need to be built in 1958. To green the county, 900,000 mu of trees need to be planted. These huge projects are unprecedented. To achieve such projects, the existing labor force is obviously not enough (each laborer in the county needs to undertake 120 capital construction tasks, accounting for 40% of their annual labor input). This creates a contradiction between the amount of work and the insufficient existing labor force. It is not possible to solve this contradiction by simply relying on physical strength and extending working hours. The only way is to create advanced tools in capital construction projects to replace and reduce physical labor, and find a way out by improving labor efficiency.

Second, the problem of agricultural machinery supply. Due to the agricultural requirements to increase yield per unit area and deep plowing and fine cultivation, it is clearly impossible to adapt with only old-fashioned farm tools and without the supply of agricultural machinery. To realize wheat "crossing the Yellow River" (high yield), in the past, fertilizer was applied once and water was irrigated twice, but now it is necessary to achieve "four fertilizers and five irrigations," and the land needs to be truly cultivated intensively. To achieve such requirements, a large supply of agricultural machinery is needed. This puts forward new requirements for the development of industry. Therefore, it is necessary to actively develop local industries, equip our agricultural army with advanced agricultural machinery, and change the past simple farming tools and backward construction methods in agricultural capital construction. This is a new task before us.

How to develop industry to meet the requirements of the agricultural leap forward?

How to develop industry? What kind of industry to develop? According to the requirements of agricultural development and natural resource conditions, our slogan is: Build whatever factories are needed for agricultural production; local industry leaps forward wherever agriculture leaps forward. The specific requirements are: to basically realize the mechanization of agricultural cultivation, farmland irrigation, and agricultural product processing within three years; to basically realize rural electrification in two years; and to have the total industrial output value exceed the agricultural output value in two years. And the following plans are set:

I. Develop small and medium-sized cultivation, water conservancy, and transportation machinery

The county has a total of 711,791 mu of cultivated land, of which 320,000 mu are suitable for large tractors and 283,000 mu are suitable for small tractors. The county currently has 39 large tractors, serving 180,000 mu in 1958 and 320,000 mu in 1959. For land suitable for small tractors, based on each small tractor cultivating 2,000 mu per year, a total of 142 small tractors are needed. In order to achieve mechanization in cultivation, 50 small tractors will be self-made in 1958, and another 92 will be produced in 1959. In this way, the mechanization and semi-mechanization of cultivation, harrowing, raking, and harvesting will be basically realized within two years. Full mechanization of water irrigation will be achieved within three years, completely eliminating the primitive and backward tools in cultivation and irrigation. Of the existing 16 farm tool manufacturing and repair factories and iron and woodworking cooperatives in the county, 12 factories and cooperatives can use the power generated by hydropower stations as hydropower stations are completed, and 6 factories can use biogas as power. As long as some equipment is added, 44 new products can be manufactured. These include small tractors, small locomotives, seeders, harvesters, cultivators, nimble water pumps, new-style water lifting tools, mountain carts, seedling transplanters, small drilling rigs, powered seedling dividers, and soil shovels for low-lying areas.

II. In order to strive for self-sufficiency in raw materials and support the great leap forward in industrial production, vigorously carry out raw material production

Eight small blast furnaces will be built in 1958 (striving to complete twelve). They will be put into production in July and August respectively, with an iron output of 1,200 tons. In 1959, the cumulative number of small blast furnaces will increase to fifteen, with an annual output of 22,000 tons. In addition to meeting the county's own needs, 10,000 tons can also be handed over to the state. Four small native copper smelting plants will be established in 1958 and put into production in August, with a copper output of 25,000 jin by the end of the year. In 1959, the cumulative number will be five, with an annual output of 70,000 jin. Ninety-nine small cement plants will be established in 1958, producing 2,700 tons of cement. In 1959, the annual output will reach 10,000 tons on the premise of improving production methods, basically achieving self-sufficiency. A native lead smelting mine will be established in 1958 and put into production in September, with a lead output of 15,000 jin by the end of the year. In 1959, it will be expanded, and the total annual output will reach 50,000 jin.

III. Develop the processing of various agricultural and sideline products

(1) Grain processing plants. The county's total grain consumption for humans and animals that needs to be processed is about 100 million jin, requiring 2 million man-days and 2 million animal-days. Within two years, electricity and water mills will be used to eliminate the manual and animal-powered grinding methods. This item alone can save 390,000 labor and animal days for other construction.

(2) Use small power machinery to process feed. The county has a total of 50,000 heads of cattle, donkeys, mules, and horses, using a total of 216 million jin of feed grass. Manual processing requires 1.06 million man-days. Using power processing methods can save 740,000 workdays for other construction.

(3) Small-scale mechanized cotton processing. In 1957, 21 million jin of seed cotton were produced, with 17.6 million jin processed by small mechanized power and 2.4 million jin processed manually. From 1958 onwards, with the increase in cotton production, another cotton processing plant will be built to eliminate the phenomenon of manual processing.

(4) Use small machinery to process oil. In 1957, 13.8 million jin of cottonseed were produced. Apart from transferring 9 million jin, the rest was all processed manually. In 1958, 24 million jin of cottonseed can be produced. Apart from transferring 9 million jin, the rest will be processed by small mechanized power, eliminating the phenomenon of manual processing.

(5) Develop the hemp fiber industry and the processing of medicinal materials and fruits.

Third, basically achieve rural electrification within two years. The measures taken by the county party committee are: focusing on trial implementation in Louxia Village in 1957. In 1958, distribute points by district and establish 15 hydropower stations and 51 biogas power stations. 140 small factories will use electric power for processing. The number of households using electric lighting in the county will account for more than 50% of the total number of households in the county. In 1959, fully bloom, and every village will realize electrification. By the end of 1959, factories using electric power as power processing will account for more than 70% of the total number of factories. Rural lighting will reach 90% of the total number of farm households in the county.

Achieving rural electrification in two years not only has superior natural conditions, but also, after trial implementation, has formed a mass urgent demand and action. After the completion of the Louxia Hydropower Station, it brought about an epoch-making change in the thinking of the vast number of farmers, especially the wavering well-to-do middle peasants at that time, who not only believed that the Communist Party could lead the people to build a strong industry, but also believed that there were ways to build a new type of socialist countryside. After the electric lights came on, the farmers composed many rhymes to praise the beginning of the new life and their love for the Party. They said: "The sun goes down and the moon rises, thousands of stars fall from the sky, the red star falls to Louxia Village, men, women, old and young smile, a power station is built in the village, and every member installs a light, the first time since ancient times, thank leader Mao Zedong."

Industrial planning becomes a material force when it meets the masses.

After the county party committee's industrial plan was announced to the masses, it immediately became a material force. The movement of the whole party running industry, all levels running industry, and the whole people running industry immediately formed a climax throughout the county. In less than half a year, the county expanded and built 174 new factories and societies on the basis of the original 28, which is equal to six times the number of factories built in the county in the past five years. Completed 55% of the county party committee's 1958 construction projects (300). Another feature of factory construction is early production. According to incomplete statistics, 130 factories have now been officially put into production, accounting for 76% of the planned total number of factories, including 26 granular fertilizer factories, 50 cement factories, 20 farm tool repair factories, 1 stone factory, 5 power stations, and 1 comprehensive food processing factory. Under the slogan of building factories, producing, and creating at the same time, the employees launched a technical innovation movement. Especially in improving tools and creating new products, great achievements have been made. According to the statistics of 200 employees in 12 factories and societies, they have created 36 new products and modified more than 15,000 various tools in 20 days of launching the suggestion and contribution movement. The technical innovation movement of employees not only made contributions to improving industrial production and reducing costs, but more importantly, played a huge role in supporting the great leap forward in agriculture. For example, the employees of the Beidaguo Farm Tool Repair Factory worked hard for seven days and created small iron rails made of triangular iron and a small locomotive converted from a five-horsepower diesel engine. After the success of this product, it was put into the construction of the Yangwowo Medium-sized Reservoir. It only takes three people to operate it, and it can carry about 15 small cars, carrying 20,000 jin of stones in one trip. Its daily carrying capacity is equal to the daily carrying capacity of 100 people and 100 cars. It saved 48,000 man-animal workdays in 16 days of work. Due to the creation of new tools, the completion time of this reservoir was greatly advanced. The employees of the cement factory created a stone crusher that can break more than 10,000 jin per day in just four days. This machine not only produces the total amount of work equal to that of 70 people and 30 animal power in one day, but also upgrades low-grade cement to medium-grade cement. This initiative played a supporting role in supporting farmland water conservancy construction and reducing the burden on the national large industry.

As long as the party's leadership is strengthened, the role of party organizations at all levels is brought into play, and the masses are fully mobilized and relied upon, all difficulties can be overcome. For example, in order to realize the plan of producing 1,000 jin of grain per mu in the whole township in 1958, the Yuanzhuang Township Party Committee adopted the method of each society investing, raising funds, and drawing people while building water conservancy, and established a joint-run granular fertilizer processing plant under the leadership of the township. Each society drew 37 people, temporarily rented sheepfolds, and the members brought their own simple tools and quickly put them into production. They worked hard when they were idle and less when they were busy. They produced an average of 15,000 jin of fertilizer per day. Based on 240 days a year, they can produce a total of 3.6 million jin of fertilizer. In addition to meeting the needs of the township, they can also support 500,000 jin to neighboring townships. In order to facilitate the masses and reduce transportation costs, in mid-April, the pharmaceutical company drew two veterans and three novices, brought their own tools, and went deep into the mountain medicinal material production area of ​​Xiadian Village to purchase and process them on the spot, and created 22 kinds of finished medicine pills in six days.

In order to overcome the technical difficulties in factory construction, the County Industrial Bureau adopted the methods of dividing factory leaders, studying abroad, building first and then specializing, and contracting to the end. Since February, people have been drawn to study and practice outside for 14 projects, including biogas, iron, copper, lead, paper, agricultural machinery, and cement, a total of 23 times and 109 people. For example, the small blast furnace is small in the national sense, but it is a relatively large and complex factory in Xingtai. We drew five cadres at the section chief level (including one pre-assigned as the party committee secretary and four workshop directors) and 16 high school students, led by the party committee secretary to Qingdao to study. Technology and administration are all included, so as to achieve comprehensive learning, comprehensive construction, and comprehensive production. This approach effectively solved the difficulties we encountered in technology.

Judging from the development of local industry in our county in the past six months, as the Party Central Committee pointed out: "...This year's new upsurge in industry was promoted by the new upsurge in agriculture last winter and this spring, and the rapid development of industry will inevitably turn around and promote the rapid development of agriculture." We also deeply feel the greatness of the party's mass line once again. Practice has proved that running industry is the same as doing agriculture. As long as we resolutely rely on the masses and implement the policy of the whole party and the whole people running industry, all difficulties can be solved; and only by resolutely relying on the masses can we comprehensively and correctly implement the general line of building socialism with more, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by the Party Central Committee, and can we accelerate the development of local industry and support the great leap forward in agriculture.

    农业需要什么就生产什么
    中共河北省邢台县委第一书记　张玉美
    邢台县在河北省的南部，是一个多山少平原的县份。山区有四道大川，两条大河，土地较少；县城周围是一片平原，土地比较肥沃。去冬和今春以来，邢台县的人民出现了一个“思想大跃进、人人大跃进和生产大跃进”的热潮。全县二十五万人民以气吞山河的英雄气概，向大自然展开了猛烈的进军。全县提出的口号是：苦战一年，改变自然面貌，实现六化、八变、三高潮。六化是：农田水利化，荒山绿化，坡地梯田化，农作物高产化，农村电气化，社社富裕中农化；八变是：变水害为水利，变贫困为富裕，秃山变绿山，赖地变良田，粗耕变细耕，劣种变良种，变四害为四无，弱畜变壮畜。三高潮是：思想跃进高潮，水利积肥高潮，生产竞赛高潮。经过半年的日夜鏖战，在各个战线上都创造了奇迹，获得了巨大成就。
    农业生产大跃进带来了什么问题？
    第一、劳动力不足的问题。由于农业生产的全面跃进，各方面都发生了劳动力不足的问题。为了实现全县水利化，1958年需要修筑中小型水库二千座，开渠六百多道，打水窖四万个，打井一千眼，打坑塘五百个。绿化全县需要植树造林九十万亩。这些浩大的工程是以前所没有过的，要实现这样的工程，现有劳动力显然不够（全县每个劳动力需担负基建工一百二十个，占个人全年投工的40％），这就发生了工作量和现有劳动力不足的矛盾。解决这个矛盾，单靠拼体力、延长劳动时间是不行的。唯一的办法是在基建工程上创造先进的工具，代替和减轻体力劳动，从提高劳动效率方面找出路。
    第二、农业机械的供应问题。由于农业要求提高单位面积产量和深耕细作，只靠旧式农具，没有农业机械的供应，显然是不能适应的。为了实现小麦“过黄河”，过去是施一次肥料浇两水，现在就要做到“四肥五水”，土地需要真正做到精耕细作。实现这样的要求，就需要供应大量的农业机械。这就给发展工业提出新的要求。因此，必须积极发展地方工业，用先进的农业机械来装备我们的农业大军，改变过去那种简单的耕作农具和农业基本建设上落后的施工方法。这是摆在我们面前的新课题。
    如何发展工业以适应农业跃进的要求？
    如何发展工业？发展什么工业？根据农业发展的要求和自然资源条件，我们提出的口号是：农业生产需要什么，就建什么工厂；农业跃进到那里，地方工业就跃到那里。具体要求是：三年内基本上实现农业耕作、农田灌溉、土产加工机械化；二年基本实现农村电气化；二年工业总产值超过农业产值。并且订出以下的规划：
    一、发展中小型的耕作、水
  利和运输机械
    全县耕地面积共有七十一万一千七百九十一亩，其中适于大型拖拉机耕种的有三十二万亩，适合小型拖拉机耕种的二十八万三千亩。我县现有大型拖拉机三十九台，1958年服务面积十八万亩，1959年服务面积三十二万亩。适合小拖拉机耕种的土地，按每个小拖拉机年耕二千亩计，共需小拖拉机一百四十二台。为了实现耕作方面的机械化，1958年自制小拖拉机五十台，1959年再生产九十二台，这样两年内基本上实现耕、耙、扒、收方面的机械化和半机械化。三年内全部达到水利灌溉机械化，彻底消灭耕作灌溉中的原始落后工具。全县已有的十六个农具制造修配厂和铁木业社，随着水力发电站的建成，有十二个厂社可以利用水力发电的动力，有六个厂可以利用沼气为动力，只要再增加一些设备，就可制造出新产品四十四种。其中有小型拖拉机、小火车头、播种机、收割机、中耕器、灵巧水泵、新式提水工具、山区土车、移苗器、小型钻探机、动力分苗机、低洼地区的铲土机等。
    二、为争取原材料自给，支
  持工业生产大跃进，要大力进
  行原材料生产
    1958年将建立八个小型炼铁高炉（争取完成十二个），7至8月分别投入生产，产铁达到一千二百吨。1959年小高炉累计发展到十五个，年产量达到二万二千吨，除满足本县自用以外，还可交给国家一万吨。1958年建立四个小型土法炼铜厂，8月投入生产，至年底产铜二万五千斤。1959年累建为五个，全年产量达到七万斤。1958年建立小型水泥厂九十九个，产水泥二千七百吨。1959年在改进生产方式前提下年产量达到一万吨，基本上达到自给。1958年建立土法炼铅矿一个，9月投入生产，至年底将产铅一万五千斤，1959年加以扩建，全年总产量达到五万斤。
    三、发展各种农副土产品加工
    （1）粮食加工厂。全县人畜食用粮食需要加工的有一亿斤左右，需用二百万个人工，二百万个畜工。两年内采用电力、水磨等方法，消灭人推畜拉碾磨加工的方法，这一项可节省出劳畜工三十九万个用于其它建设。
    （2）采用小型动力机械加工饲料。全县共有牛、驴、骡、马五万头，共用饲草二亿一千六百万斤，用人力加工即需用一百零六万人力。采用动力加工的方法，可节省出七十四万劳动日用于其它建设。
    （3）小型机械加工棉花。1957年产籽棉二千一百万斤，用小型机械动力加工一千七百六十万斤，用人加工二百四十万斤。从1958年起，随着棉花产量的提高，再新建棉花加工厂一个，消灭人力加工的现象。
   （4）采用小型机械加工油料。1957年产棉籽一千三百八十万斤，除外调九百万斤以外，其余全部是人力加工。1958年可产棉籽二千四百万斤，除外调九百万斤外，其余全部采用小型动力机械加工，消灭人力加工现象。
    （5）发展麻纤维工业，药材果食加工工业。
    三、两年内基本实现农村电气化。县委采取的措施是：1957年在楼下村重点试办。1958年分区布点，建立水力发电站十五个，沼气发电站五十一个。将有一百四十个小型工厂用电力加工。全县用电照明户将占全县总户数的50％以上。1959年全面开花，村村实现电气化。到1959年年底，全县工厂用电力当动力加工的占总厂数的70％以上。农村照明达到全县总农户的90％。
    二年实现农村电气化，不仅有优越的自然条件，而且经过试办，已经形成群众性的迫切要求和行动。楼下水电站建成后，在广大农民思想上起了划时代的变化，特别是当时动摇不定的富裕中农，不仅确信了共产党能领导人民建设强大的工业，而且也确信有办法建设社会主义的新型农村。当电灯发亮以后，农民编出许多顺口溜，歌颂新生活的开端和对党的热爱。他们说：“太阳下山月亮升，天上掉下千颗星，红星掉到楼下村，男女老少笑盈盈，村里建起发电站，社员个个安上灯，自古以来头一次，感谢领袖毛泽东。”
   工业规划和群众见面，就变成了物质力量。
    县委的工业规划向群众公布以后，立即变成了物质力量。全党办工业、各级办工业、全民办工业的运动马上在全县范围内形成了高潮。不到半年之久，全县在原有二十八个厂社基础上就扩建和新建了一百七十四个，等于全县五年来建厂数的六倍之多。完成县委1958年建设项目（三百个）的55％强。建厂的另一个特点是投入生产早。据不完全统计，现在已有一百三十个厂子正式投入生产，占计划建厂总数的76％，其中有颗粒肥料厂二十六个、水泥厂五十个、农具修配厂二十个、石料厂一个、电站五个、食品综合加工厂一个。我们在边建厂边生产边创造的口号下，职工们开展了技术革新运动。尤其是在改良工具、创造新产品上，已作出很大成绩。仅据十二个厂社的二百名职工在开展献策献计运动的二十天中，就制出新产品三十六种，改制各种工具一万五千多件。职工们的技术革新运动不仅对提高工业生产降低成本作出贡献，更重要的是对支持农业大跃进起了极大的作用。比如北大郭农具修配厂的职工们七天苦钻细研，创造了以三角铁制造的小铁轨和用五马力柴油机改制成的小火车头。这个产品创制成功后，就投入了羊窝弯中型水库施工建设。只用三人操作，就能带十五个左右小车皮，一趟可拉二万斤石头，它一天的载运量，等于百人百车一天的载运量，它工作十六天，就节省人畜工四万八千个。由于新工具的创造，大大提前了这个水库的竣工时间。水泥厂的职工们，仅四天时间就创制成一个日破万斤以上的碎石机。这部机器不仅一天生产等于七十个人和三十头畜力一天的总工程量，而且把低标号水泥提升为中标号水泥。这一创举对支持农田水利建设、减轻国家大工业的负担，起了辅助作用。
    只要加强党的领导，发挥各级党组织的作用，充分发动和依靠群众，什么困难都是可以克服的。如元庄乡党委为实现1958年全乡亩产千斤粮的计划，在兴修水利的同时，采用各社入股凑资抽人的办法，在乡领导下，成立了联办形式的颗粒肥加工厂。各社抽出了三十七人，暂租借羊圈，社员自带简易工具，很快投入了生产。他们农闲时大搞，农忙时小搞，每日平均产肥一万五千斤，全年按二百四十天计算，共可生产肥料三百六十万斤。除满足本乡需要以外，还可支援邻乡五十万斤。药材公司为了便利群众，减少运费，在4月中旬抽出两个老手三个新手，自带工具，深入深山药材产地下店村就地收购，就地加工，在六天内新创制出成药丸二十二种。
    县工业局为了克服建厂中的技术困难，采取了分厂挂帅、外出留学、先专后建、一包到底的方法。从2月以来，抽人赴外学习试习的，有沼气、铁、铜、铅、纸、农械、水泥等十四项，共二十三次、一百零九人。如小高炉，在全国说来是小的，在邢台说来则是较大较复杂的厂子。我们抽出了相当科长级的干部五名（其中一名预配为党委书记，四个车间主任），十六名高中学生，由党委书记带领赴青岛学习。技术和行政全包起来，作到包学、包建、包生产。这种做法有力地解决了我们在技术上遇到的困难。
    从我县半年以来地方工业发展的情况来看，正如党中央所指出的：“……今年的工业新高潮，是由去冬今春的农业新高潮推动起来的，而工业的迅速发展，又必然反转过来推动农业的迅速发展。”我们也再一次深深感到党的群众路线伟大。实践证明，办工业和搞农业一样，只要我们坚决依靠群众，贯彻全党全民办工业的方针，一切困难都可以解决；也只有坚决依靠群众，才能全面的正确的贯彻党中央提出的多快好省建设社会主义的总路线，也才能加速地方工业的发展，支持农业大跃进。
