Xinhua News Agency, May 21st. Chairman Mao Zedong inspected the first domestically produced "Dongfeng" brand sedan this afternoon. Together with Comrade Lin Boqu, he rode in the car, driving slowly around the back garden of Huairentang twice. After getting out of the car, Chairman Mao smiled and said to the representatives of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China gathered around him: "I'm riding in a car made by ourselves!"

This sedan is a gift from all the workers of the Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. After the trial production was successful, the workers transported it to Beijing and presented it to the congress on the 15th. In a letter to the congress, they assured the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao that they would speed up their efforts to complete the trial production of twelve new types of vehicles ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota this year, transforming the single-product automobile factory into a multi-product automobile factory.

    毛主席乘坐东风牌轿车
    他笑着说：“坐了我们自己制造的小汽车了！”
    新华社21日讯　毛泽东主席在今天下午观看了国产的第一辆“东风”牌小轿车，并同林伯渠同志一起乘着这辆汽车，在怀仁堂后花园缓缓行驶了两周。毛主席下了汽车，对聚集在周围的中共八大第二次会议的代表们笑着说：“坐了我们自己制造的小汽车了！”
    这辆小轿车是长春第一汽车制造厂全体职工献给中共八大第二次会议的礼物。职工们在试制成功后即运往北京，于15日向大会献礼，并在给大会的一封信中，向党中央和毛主席保证：要快马加鞭，提前和超额完成今年十二个新品种汽车的试制任务，将单一品种的汽车厂，改造成为多品种的汽车厂。（附图片）
