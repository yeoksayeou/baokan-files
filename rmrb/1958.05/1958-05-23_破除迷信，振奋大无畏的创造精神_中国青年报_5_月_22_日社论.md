It is now the early summer season when a hundred flowers bloom. Nature has adorned our beloved motherland even more beautifully. However, what is most attractive this summer is not the flowers of nature, but the flowers of wisdom and creation blooming from our hardworking and courageous 600 million people. Since the Great Leap Forward, the inventions and creations that have emerged on all fronts of the motherland are truly endless. Whether you walk into the Industrial Leap Forward Exhibition Hall, or come to the Agricultural Tool Innovation Exhibition, or open the daily newspaper, you will feel that there is a vibrant scene of creation everywhere, and there are countless inventors and creators everywhere. This vigorous creation fully demonstrates the great wisdom and strength of the Chinese people.

What is particularly exciting is that the vast majority of these numerous inventors and creators have never attended any university or specialized school, let alone studied abroad. They are ordinary workers and farmers with low levels of education, who are regarded as laymen in science. For example, Liu Caopei, who created thirteen kinds of agricultural tools, is a young man with only a junior primary school education. Cao Wentao, the inventor of the eight-use processing machine, is also a "muddy fellow" who has only studied for four years. The young fitter Zheng Jinbin has continuously created seventeen kinds of advanced machines and tools such as the "small electric punch press," which has turned manual operation into mechanized production, enabling him to complete twenty-four years of work in one year. Not only that, but many "local experts" have surpassed "foreign PhDs." For example, Li Shimei, who solved the problem of eradicating termite plagues that experts at home and abroad could not solve, only studied for one year of junior high school, and five years ago he was still a layman. Wang Baojing, who has been hired as a special researcher in agricultural science and has repeatedly created miracles in agricultural production increase, is a poor peasant who has only attended elementary school for three years. Looking at these countless moving examples is truly exhilarating. Today, these inventions and creations like stars in the sky eloquently prove that the great Chinese people who have been liberated can not only be the masters of society, but also be the masters of nature.

Originally, all the wealth in the world was created by the working people, and all the knowledge in the world was accumulated by the working people. However, the "noble" ruling class in the old society not only seized the fruits of the labor of the working people, deprived the working people of the right to education, but also dressed themselves up as the smartest people in the world, as if only they were qualified to understand science and technology, while the "despicable" workers and peasants were stupid and not qualified to engage in inventions and creations. However, a large number of historical facts tell us precisely that the "noble" are the most stupid, and the "despicable" are the most intelligent. Scientific and technological inventions have always come from the oppressed classes, that is, from those who have lower social status, less knowledge, poorer conditions, and are always looked down upon at the beginning, and even suffer blows, torture, and execution. For example, Li Shizhen, the great Chinese scientist, pharmacologist, and famous doctor, came from a poor family that was despised; Watt, the inventor of the steam engine, was a mechanical instrument apprentice who later opened a business in Glasgow, but was squeezed out by the local guild and had to work as an instrument repairman in the university; Faraday, the founder of electrical engineering theory, was an apprentice in a bookbinding workshop; Edison, the inventor, was considered unteachable as a child and was expelled from school, and only attended elementary school for three months in his life; Franklin, who discovered the use of electricity, was a typesetter; the Wright brothers, who created the first airplane (gasoline engine type), were small bicycle vendors; Arkwright, the inventor of the spinning machine, was a traveling barber; Stephenson, the inventor of the locomotive, was a coal mine helper; and Lawrence, the inventor of the hexagonal lathe, was a carpenter. Such examples are endless. In the old society, the creative talents of the working people were under the destruction and suppression of the ruling class. But even in that situation, the people were still able to achieve such achievements. Then, in today's world, where the liberated working people are bound to come up with more and better inventions and creations, is this not entirely reasonable? The rapidly developing Soviet science and technology, which overwhelms all capitalist countries, is the most vivid and powerful proof.

But in the minds of some of us, there is still a stubborn superstition that Chinese people are always inferior to the British and Americans, or so-called foreigners, in science and technology. They have been bullied by imperialism for more than a hundred years, and they still can't stand up straight, and there is still a sense of inferiority and a slave mentality. Especially some bourgeois intellectuals, on the one hand, they put on a "learned" air in front of workers and peasants, and on the other hand, this sense of inferiority and slave mentality is particularly serious in front of foreigners. In their view, we cannot think of things that cannot be found in foreign books; we cannot do things that foreign countries have not done. In fact, what is a foreigner? From the perspective of foreigners, aren't we Chinese also foreigners? We are ordinary people living on the ground, but from the perspective of people living on other planets, aren't we also gods living in the sky? Of course, we must humbly learn all the good and useful experiences of foreign countries. But seeing things as mysterious is called superstition. We should not be arrogant, but we must never underestimate ourselves. We must resolutely break this mysterious view and superstition that suppresses the creation of our people. Chairman Mao said: "China is a country with 9.6 million square kilometers of land and 600 million people, and China should make a greater contribution to mankind." Indeed, not only should we make contributions, but we must make greater contributions. Our ancestors made brilliant contributions to the ancient culture of mankind. Today, can't our liberated descendants make even greater contributions to mankind? Therefore, not only must we do what foreign countries have already done, but we must also do what foreign countries have not done. Some people who worship the United States always think that the industry and science and technology of the United States are amazing. In our view, these things in the United States are important and not important. They are important because they are currently stronger than us; they are not important because the achievements we will achieve in the future must greatly exceed them. Two examples can be cited to illustrate this: Not long ago, people regarded the manufacture of tractors as a mysterious thing, but now many small and medium-sized factories in various provinces with simple equipment have manufactured tractors themselves, and 10,000 units will be produced this year! Not long ago, many people regarded foreign "brand-name" goods as mysterious things, but during the Great Leap Forward, according to incomplete statistics in Shanghai alone, the quality of 227 products has reached or exceeded the "brand-name" goods of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France. And all this is just the beginning.

The bugle of the technological revolution has sounded. Every one of our young people must bravely stand at the forefront of this revolution. The Communist Youth League organizations must make the vast number of young people understand: In terms of population, our country has the most; in terms of geographical conditions, our country is vast and rich in resources and has a good climate; in terms of politics, we have the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and an advanced socialist system. We have the guidance of invincible Marxism-Leninism. We also have the brotherly assistance of the great Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries. Therefore, our country must and will be able to make greater contributions to mankind. As long as we resolutely eliminate the sense of inferiority, cut off self-deprecation, break down superstition, and invigorate the fearless spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, we will be able to greatly accelerate the speed of construction, surpass all capitalist countries in the world in the shortest historical period, and build our motherland into the most advanced and powerful country in the world.

    破除迷信，振奋大无畏的创造精神
    中国青年报5月22日社论
    现在正是百花争艳的初夏时节。大自然把我们可爱的祖国，装扮得更加美丽了。但是，今年的夏天，最吸引人的却并不是自然界的花朵，而是从我们勤劳勇敢的六亿人民中开放出来的智慧的花朵，创造的花朵。从大跃进以来，在祖国各个战线上所出现的发明创造，真是层出无穷。无论当你走进工业跃进展览馆，或是来到农具革新展览会，或是打开每天的报纸，都会感到到处都是一片蓬勃的创造景象，到处都有数不尽的发明家和创造家。这种蓬勃的创造，充分地显示了我国人民的伟大智慧和力量。
    特别使人兴奋的是，这样大量的发明家、创造家，绝大多数并没有进过什么大学或者专科学校，更没有留过什么洋，而是文化程度不高，在科学方面被人看做是外行的普通工人和农民。例如像创造了十三种农具的刘草佩，是一个只有初小文化程度的青年。发明八用加工机的曹文韬，也是一个只念过四年书的“泥巴佬”。青年钳工郑金斌，连续创造了“小型电动冲床”等十七种先进机器和工具，使手工操作变成了机械化生产，他自己因此一年可完成二十四年工作量。不但如此，许多“土专家”还赛过了“洋博士”。像解决了古今中外专家无法解决的根治白蚁灾害问题的李始美，只念过一年初中，五年前他还是一个外行。被聘为农业科学特约研究员、在农业增产上连创奇迹的王保京，是一个只上过三年小学的贫农。看看这数不尽的动人的例子，真叫人痛快。今天，这满天星斗般的发明创造，雄辩地证明了：获得了解放的伟大的中国人民，不但能够做社会的主人，而且也一定能够做大自然的主人。
    本来，世界上的一切财富都是劳动人民创造的，世界上的一切知识也是劳动人民积累起来的。可是旧社会里“高贵”的统治阶级，不但侵占了劳动人民的劳动成果，剥夺了劳动人民受教育的权利，而且还把自己装扮成世界上最聪明的人，好像唯有他们才配懂得科学技术，而“卑贱”的工人、农民却是愚蠢的，不配搞什么发明创造的。但是，大量的历史事实恰恰告诉我们：“高贵”者是最愚蠢的，“卑贱”者是最聪明的。科学、技术发明历来大都出于被压迫阶级，即是说，出于那些社会地位较低、学问较少、条件较差、在开始时总是被人看不起、甚至受打击、受折磨、受刑戮的人。例如：我国伟大的科学家、药物学家和名医李时珍，是出身于受人轻视的贫苦家庭；发明蒸汽机的瓦特是机械仪表学徒，后来到格拉斯哥开业，受当地行会排挤，只好到大学里做修理仪器工人；电机工程理论的奠基人法拉弟，是订书作坊的学徒；发明家爱迪生小时被认为不堪教诲，遭学校开除，一生只上过三个月小学；发现电的利用的佛兰克林，是一个排字工人；创造第一架飞机（汽油发动机式）的莱特兄弟，是自行车小商贩；纺纱机发明人阿克奈特，是个流动理发匠；机车发明人史蒂文生，是个煤矿帮工；六角车床的发明人劳润斯，是个木工。这样的例子是说不完的。在旧社会里，劳动人民的创造才能是处在统治阶级的摧残和压抑下的。但是在那样情况下，人民仍然能够搞出这样的成就来。那么，在今天，获得了解放的劳动人民一定要搞出更多、更好的发明创造来，这不是完全合乎情理的吗？迅速发展的苏联科学技术，压倒了一切资本主义国家，就是最生动、最有力的证明。
    可是在我们有一些人的头脑里，却还顽固地存在一种迷信，以为我们中国人搞科学、技术总比不上英美，比不上所谓洋人。他们受了帝国主义一百多年的欺侮，到现在还硬不起腰干，还存在着一种自卑感和奴隶心理。特别是有一些资产阶级知识分子，他们一方面在工农面前摆起“博学”的架子，另一方面在洋人的面前，这种自卑感和奴隶心理就显得特别的严重。在他们看来，凡是洋人的书上找不到“根据”的事情，我们就不能想；凡是外国还没有干过的事情，我们就不能干。其实，什么叫做洋人呢？从外国人看来，我们中国人不是同样也是洋人吗？我们是住在地上的凡人，但是从住在别的星球上的人看来，我们不是同样也是住在天上的神仙吗？当然，外国一切好的、有用的经验，我们都要虚心学习。但是把事情看得神秘了，就叫做迷信。我们不应该妄自尊大，但是也决不应该妄自菲薄。我们要坚决地打破这种压抑我们人民创造的神秘观点和迷信。毛主席说：“中国是一个具有九百六十万平方公里土地和六万万人口的国家，中国应当对于人类有较大的贡献。”的确，不但要有贡献，而且一定要做到有较大的贡献。我们的祖先，在人类的古代文化上是曾经作出了辉煌的贡献的。今天，我们已经解放了的后代，难道不能够为人类作出更大的贡献来吗？因此，不但是外国已经做的，我们一定要做；而且外国还没有做的，我们也一定要做到。一些崇拜美国的人，总以为美国的工业和科学、技术很了不起。在我们看来，美国的这些东西又算数，又不算数。说算数，因为它在目前还比我们强；说不算数，因为我们将来要达到的成就一定要大大地超过它。可以举两个例子来说明：在不久以前，人们还把制造拖拉机看成是神秘的事情，但是现在各个省许多设备简陋的中小工厂都自己制造了拖拉机，今年就要生产一万台！在不久以前，许多人把外国的“名牌”货看成神秘的东西，但是在大跃进中，单是上海一地的不完全统计，就有二百二十七件产品的质量赶上或者超过了英、美、法等国的“名牌”货。而这一切，还仅仅是开始而已。
    技术革命的号角已经响了。我们每一个青年都要奋勇地站在这个革命的前列。共青团的组织要使广大青年懂得：讲人口，数我国最多；讲地理条件，我国地大物博，气候良好，资源丰富；讲政治，我们有伟大的中国共产党的领导，有先进的社会主义制度。我们有战无不胜的马克思列宁主义指导。我们还有着伟大的苏联和其他人民民主国家兄弟般的援助。因此我们的国家一定要、也一定能够为人类作出较大的贡献来。只要我们坚决地打掉自卑感，砍去妄自菲薄，破除迷信，振奋敢想、敢说、敢做的大无畏创造精神，我们一定能够大大加快建设速度，在最短的历史时期内，把世界上一切资本主义国家远远地抛在后面，把我们祖国建设成为一个世界上最先进、最强大的国家。
