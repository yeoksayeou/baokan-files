Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The "Akahata Newspaper" on the 17th revealed in detail the truth about the Kishi Nobusuke government's consistent policy of hostility towards China, which led to the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, and refuted the absurd propaganda spread by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the monopoly capitalists' controlled newspapers that attacked China and attempted to shift the responsibility for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations onto China. The "Akahata Newspaper" called on the Japanese people to thoroughly investigate Kishi Nobusuke's responsibility for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations.

The "Akahata Newspaper" pointed out that since the founding of New China, China has consistently adopted an attitude of not dwelling on past grievances and not blaming the past, and has actively strived to enhance friendly relations between the two countries. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government, on the contrary, repaid kindness with enmity, adopted a hostile attitude towards China, and deliberately undermined Sino-Japanese relations.

The "Akahata Newspaper" also published talks by Ryoji Koyama, Standing Director of the Political Department of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan, Eiichi Shukutani, Chairman of the Japan Commodity Exhibition, and Michitaka Kaino, a renowned legal expert and professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University. They unanimously condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government for undermining Sino-Japanese trade and Sino-Japanese relations, and pointed out that all responsibility for the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations should be borne by Kishi Nobusuke.

Ryoji Koyama pointed out that Kishi Nobusuke's attitude is the same fascist style as the Tojo Hideki government.

Michitaka Kaino said that China's attitude towards the Kishi Nobusuke government this time is reasonable, because no one is willing to exchange trade benefits at the cost of allowing the national flag, which symbolizes the country, to be insulted.

They unanimously believe that in order to restore Sino-Japanese trade and Sino-Japanese relations to normal, Prime Minister Kishi Nobusuke and Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi must retract their previous remarks and recognize China's legitimate right to display its national flag.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japanese Communist Party's organ "Akahata Newspaper" today published an editorial calling on all members of the Japanese Communist Party to shatter the Kishi Nobusuke government's anti-China propaganda and expose Kishi Nobusuke's anti-people and reactionary features.

The editorial pointed out that Sino-Japanese relations are facing an important stage, and the friendly relations between China and Japan, which have been built up over the years through the efforts of the people of both countries, are about to be completely destroyed by the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party. The editorial pointed out that the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party's policy of following the United States, currying favor with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and adopting a hostile policy towards China is the fundamental reason for the comprehensive stagnation of Sino-Japanese trade and the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations.

The "Akahata Newspaper" called on all Communist Party members to appeal to the broad masses of the people to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations in the final stage of the election campaign, launch a large-scale national movement, thoroughly investigate the Kishi Nobusuke government's hostile attitude towards China, and shatter its cunning propaganda attacking China.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 19th: The Japan-China Import and Export Association passed a resolution at its third member conference held today, attended by more than 200 member manufacturer representatives, demanding that the Japanese government take measures to resolve the tense situation in Sino-Japanese relations. The resolution stated that they will strengthen cooperation with relevant organizations, demand that the Japanese government take measures to resolve Sino-Japanese trade and Sino-Japanese relations issues, and do their utmost to strive for the early implementation of the fourth Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

　　日本各界认为中国采取的态度合乎道理
    日中关系恶化责在岸信介政府
    日中输出入协会要日政府消除日中紧张状态
    新华社19日讯　东京消息：“赤旗报”在17日详细地揭露了岸信介政府一贯采取敌视中国的政策，使日中关系恶化的真相，并且驳斥了岸信介政府和垄断资本家控制的报纸所散布的攻击中国，企图把日中关系恶化的责任推到中国身上的荒谬宣传。“赤旗报”号召日本人民彻底追究岸信介使日中关系恶化的责任。
    “赤旗报”指出，自从新中国成立以来，中国对日本一贯采取了不念旧恶、不咎既往的态度，积极努力增进两国的友好关系。但是，岸信介政府相反地却以仇报德，采取了敌视中国的态度，一意破坏日中关系。
    “赤旗报”同时发表了日本工会总评议会政治部常任干事小山良治、日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一和著名法律专家、东京都立大学教授戒能通孝的谈话。他们一致指责岸信介政府破坏日中贸易和日中关系，并且指出，日中关系恶化的一切责任应该由岸信介承担。
    小山良治指出，岸信介这种态度是和东条英机政府相同的法西斯作风。
    戒能通孝说，这次中国对岸信介政府采取的态度是合乎道理的，因为谁都不愿意以让象征国家的国旗任人侮辱的代价来换取贸易上的利益。
    他们一致认为，为了使日中贸易和日中关系恢复正常，必须使岸信介首相和爱知揆一官房长官取消以往的谈话，承认中国悬挂国旗的合法权利。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”今天发表社论号召日本共产党全体党员粉碎岸信介政府散布反对中国的宣传，揭露岸信介反人民的反动面貌。
    社论指出，日中关系已经面临重要的阶段，几年来依靠两国人民的努力建立起来的日中友好关系，眼看就要被岸信介政府和自由民主党彻底破坏了。社论指出，岸信介政府和自由民主党追随美国、讨好蒋介石集团、采取敌视中国的政策，是使日中贸易陷入全面停顿和使日中关系恶化的根本原因。
      “赤旗报”号召全体共产党员在竞选运动的最后阶段，向广大人民群众呼吁恢复日中邦交，展开声势浩大的国民运动，彻底追究岸信介政府敌视中国的态度，粉碎它攻击中国的狡猾宣传。
    据新华社19日讯　东京消息：日中输出入协会在今天举行的有二百多名会员厂商代表参加的第三届会员大会上通过决议，要求日本政府采取措施，解决日中关系的紧张局面。决议表示，他们将加强同各有关团体的合作，要求日本政府采取措施解决日中贸易和日中关系问题，并且竭尽全力为早日实施第四次日中贸易协定而努力。
