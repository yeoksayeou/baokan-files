    Saw a Performance for Five Cents
    One Saturday evening, Li Ling, head of the Central Philharmonic Orchestra, led some singers to give us a report on "How to Appreciate Music," adopting a method of lecturing, performing, and critiquing. They lectured on music knowledge while criticizing yellow music, followed by singing several beautiful and moving positive songs, singing and lecturing, lecturing and singing, comparing them with each other. The presentation was vivid and the education was extremely profound. This was much more rewarding and profound than just listening to a report or watching a performance. During the performance, those who had just returned from the countryside sang some newly learned folk songs, and those who had won awards abroad sang their signature pieces. They were not at all pretentious, singing as many songs as needed. Li Ling, the head of the orchestra, was both the speaker and the emcee, and he even had to carry tables and benches. This performance had no makeup or scenery; it was simple and unadorned, like everyone entertaining together in a big family, giving people an extremely intimate feeling. From beginning to end, everyone's emotions were very excited and stirred. After the report, everyone felt warm and comfortable, with an indescribable feeling. It was unexpected that a five-cent ticket could bring such a great reward.

    五分钱看了一场演出
    一个星期六的晚上，中央乐团李凌团长率领一部分歌唱家来给我们作“如何欣赏音乐”的报告，采取边讲、边演、边批判的方式。一面讲述音乐知识，一面批判黄色歌曲，接着就演唱几支优美动听的正面歌曲，唱了就讲，讲了就唱，互相对比。形象生动，教育极其深刻。这样比单听报告或单看一场演出的收获要大得多，要深刻得多。在演出中，刚从农村回来的就演唱几支新学来的民歌，在国外曾得奖的就演唱自己的拿手节目，他们没有一点架子，需要几支就唱几支。李凌团长既是报告人又兼报幕员还得抬桌搬凳。这次演出没有化装布景，简单朴素，就像是大家庭里大家在一起娱乐一样，给人一种极其亲切的感觉，自始至终大家的情绪都非常兴奋激动。报告结束后，大家心里暖洋洋的，有种说不出来的舒服，想不到花了五分钱的票价能得到这样大的收获。
