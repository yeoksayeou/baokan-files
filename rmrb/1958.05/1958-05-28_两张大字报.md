    Two Big Character Posters
  　By Ji Xuepei
    On the morning of May 3rd, I accompanied the spring plowing production inspection team organized by the Xijiadian District Committee of Jun County, Hubei, to inspect spring plowing production in the Xinghuo No. 2 Cooperative of Huangying Township.

    This is a mountainous area. Everywhere you look are red and orange mountain ridges. In the past, because there were no water conservancy facilities, nothing grew on the mountain ridges. But now, this township has built a trans-mountain canal, sixty-five li long, passing through thirty-seven mountains, and has brought water to the mountain ridges.

    When we arrived at the mountain ridges, the cooperative members were converting the land into paddy fields. Their method of converting the fields was very clever, adapting to the terrain, converting as much as possible, not seeking large, square shapes for appearance's sake, but seeking to save labor and increase production. Currently, they have almost finished converting three mountain ridges, and only need to tidy them up slightly before transplanting rice seedlings.

    The members of the inspection team greatly admired their enthusiasm, so they composed a big character poster. The big character poster read:

    Xinghuo No. 2 Cooperative is truly capable,
    Converting paddy fields according to the mountain's shape,
    Only seeking to save labor and increase production,
    Not seeking large squares for appearance,
    The large ones are more than one mu,
    The small ones are like big bamboo baskets,
    In shape, they are even fresher,
    Strip fields, square fields,
    Pointed, slanted, knife-handle fields;
    Moon fields, eggplant fields,
    Round, circular, watermelon fields,
    Looking up, fields nested within fields,
    Looking down, fields layered upon fields,
    Just waiting for the rice to turn golden in autumn,
    A mountain glittering with gold.

    After composing it, they wrote it on a large sheet of red paper and posted it on the wall outside their cooperative office. This made the cooperative members extremely happy, and they couldn't stop laughing. Especially their cooperative director, Comrade Shang Quanyang, kept smacking his lips while laughing: "Tsk, tsk! Not worth it, not worth it!"

    However, the inspection revealed that they also had shortcomings: they were digging the sweet potato mounds too slowly. (Here, the soil is hard, and when planting sweet potatoes, it is necessary to dig the ground into mounds.) They originally planned to plant five hundred mu of sweet potatoes, but now they have only dug three hundred mu, and there are still two hundred mu of sweet potato land that have not been prepared.

    Regarding this point, the inspection team criticized them, hoping that they would speed up and catch up with the season.

    Cooperative Director Shang Quanyang said: "Don't worry, we will make a leap forward."

    The inspection team left the Xinghuo No. 2 Cooperative and inspected other cooperatives in Huangying Township. Then they went to Haoping Township, Qingtang Township... On the afternoon of the 5th, the inspection team returned to the Xijiadian District Committee.

    On the morning of the 6th, the telephone in the district committee rang, and the person who answered the phone ran out shouting for the township party secretary. Secretary Chen grabbed the receiver and asked, "Who is it?"

    "It's me—Shang Quanyang. Are you Secretary Chen?"

    "Yes!"

    "Secretary Chen, please tell the comrades of the inspection team that all our two hundred mu of sweet potato mounds have been dug..."

    Comrade Chen Deming interrupted and asked, "Didn't you convert the fields these past two days?"

    "We are still converting them, the mountain ridges have been completely eliminated."

    "But..." Comrade Chen Deming asked, both happy and surprised: "How did you manage to allocate your labor force?"

    "We made a sudden assault!" After a pause, Shang Quanyang said excitedly: "We convert fields during the day and dig sweet potato mounds at night. We mobilized a total of one hundred and forty laborers, and we finished the assault in two nights."

    "Good! That's the spirit!" Comrade Chen Deming laughed and shouted into the phone: "I will definitely tell the inspection team about this. In addition, please also convey to the cooperative cadres and members that the township party committee is very satisfied with your enthusiasm, and hopes that everyone will maintain it."

    "Definitely, definitely!..."

    Comrade Chen Deming immediately told the inspection team about this happy event. The members of the inspection team unanimously believed that this small cooperative with only one hundred and fifty-one households had such enthusiasm, which was worthy of praise, and everyone decided to send them another big character poster.

    So, another bright red big character poster was written...

    两张大字报
  　吉学霈
    5月3日上午，我随湖北均县习家店区区委组织的春耕生产检查团，来到了黄莺乡星火二社检查春耕生产。
    这里是山区。到处是红橙橙的山梁子。过去因为没有水利设备，山梁子上是什么也不长的。现在呢，这个乡里修了一条过山大渠，渠有六十五里长，穿过大小三十七座山，已经把水引到山梁子上来了。
    我们来到山梁子上的时候，社员们正在改水田。他们改田的办法很巧妙，随山就势，能改多大就改多大，不图大方好看，只图省工增产。目前，他们已经把三座山梁子快改完了，只等将来稍加整理，就可插秧。
    检查团的团员们对他们的干劲十分赞赏，于是就编了张大字报。大字报上写着：
    星火二社真能干，
    随山就势改水田，
    只图省工、增产，
    不图大方、好看，
    大的一块一亩多，
    小的像个大竹篮，
    论形状，更新鲜，
    条条田，方块田，
    尖尖斜斜刀把田；
    月亮田，茄子田，
    圆圆周周西瓜田，
    往上看，田套田，
    往下看，田罗田，
    单等秋后稻谷黄，
    金金闪闪一座山。
    编好以后，用一张大红纸写起来，贴到他们社办公室外面的墙上。这可把社员们乐坏了，一个个笑的合不住嘴。特别是他们的社主任尚全扬同志，一边笑，一边直咂嘴：“啧啧！值不得，值不得！”
    可是检查的结果，他们也有缺点：红薯地扒堆扒的慢了些。（这里土质硬，种红薯的时候，需要将地扒成一堆一堆的）他们原计划种五百亩红薯，但是现在只扒了三百亩，还有二百亩红薯地没有整理。
    关于这一点，检查团给他们提出了批评，希望他们快马加鞭，赶上季节。
    社主任尚全扬说：“你们放心吧，我们一定跃进一下。”
    检查团离开星火二社，又到黄莺乡其他社作了检查。随后又到蒿坪乡、青塘乡……5日下午，检查团回到了习家店区区委会。
    6日早晨，区委会的电话铃响了，接电话的人跑出来喊着要找乡党委书记。陈书记抓起听筒问道：“谁呀？”
    “我——尚全扬。你是陈书记吗？”
    “是呀！”
    “陈书记，请你告诉检查团的同志们说，我们的二百亩红薯堆全部扒完了……”
    陈德明同志抢着问道：“这两天没有改田吗？”
    “改着呢，山梁子已经消灭光了。”
    “可是……”陈德明同志又高兴又诧异的问：“你们的劳动力怎样调配得开呀？”
    “我们突击呀！”停了停，尚全扬兴冲冲的说：“白天改田，晚上扒红薯堆。我们一共调动了一百四十个劳动力，两个晚上就突击光了。”
    “好！有劲头！”陈德明同志笑起来，向电话里喊：“我一定把这件事转告检查团。另外，也请你转告社干部和社员们，乡党委对你们这种干劲，非常满意，希望大家保持下去。”
    “一定，一定！……”
    陈德明同志把这件喜事随即就告诉了检查团。检查团的成员们一致认为：这个只有一百五十一户的小社，有如此的干劲，是值得表扬的，大家决定再给他们送张大字报。
    于是，一张红艳艳的大字报又写成了。……
