Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 8th May: A flood occurred in Emu'er Township, Huma County, Heilongjiang Province, on the 2nd due to ice jams blocking the river channel during the spring thaw on the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River. All five hundred and eight residents of the township have been evacuated from danger after two days of rescue efforts by the Soviet border troops and are now being properly settled in collective farms in the Amur Oblast of the Soviet Union, across the river. They will return to China after navigation resumes on the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River.

The Soviet border troops dispatched helicopters to rescue our disaster victims, under the personal command of Ivanov, the Second Secretary of the Amur Oblast Committee of the Soviet Union.

The Heihe Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Heilongjiang Province and the Heihe Commissioner's Office are properly handling the aftermath of the Emu'er Township disaster. In addition to a loan from the People's Bank, the Heihe Commissioner's Office has prepared 10,000 catties of grain and enough seeds. It is also prepared to help the township's farmers repair houses or build new ones and rebuild their homes.

    黑龙江呼玛县额木尔乡发生水灾
    全乡人民经苏军抢救全部脱险
    据新华社哈尔滨8日电　黑龙江省呼玛县额木尔乡2日因为黑龙江上游解冻时冰排堵塞河道而发生水灾。全乡五百零八人经过苏联边防军两天的抢救，已全部脱离险境，目前正被妥善地安置在江对岸苏联阿穆尔州的集体农庄里。他们将在黑龙江上游开航后再回到中国。
    苏联边防军为抢救我灾民，曾派来直升飞机，由苏联阿穆尔州委第二书记依万诺夫亲自指挥。
    中共黑龙江省黑河地委和黑河专员公署，正在妥善地处理额木尔乡的善后工作，除了由人民银行拨给一笔贷款外，黑河专署已准备了一万斤粮食和够用的种子，还准备帮助这个乡的农民修理房屋或建筑新的房屋，重建家园。
