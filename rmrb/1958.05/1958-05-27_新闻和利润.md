Notes

	News and Profit

	Recently, the two American news agencies (United Press and International News Service) merged into one news agency called "United Press International." The president of this news agency, Bartholomew, said when mentioning the significance of this merger: "We believe that the private enterprise system, with profit as a stimulus, is the best guarantee for objectively interviewing world news."

	Indeed, both United Press and International News Service are news-selling firms that pursue profit and are based on the private enterprise system. There is nothing wrong with saying that. However, to say that pursuing profit can best guarantee objectively interviewing world news is absurd. American news agencies that serve Wall Street bosses will not have any objective interviews. Isn't this already proven by the countless rumors and slanders recorded by United Press and International News Service?

    新闻和利润
    最近，美国的两家通讯社（合众社和国际新闻社）合并成为一家通讯社，叫做“合众国际社”。这家通讯社的社长巴塞洛缪在提到这次合并的意义时说：“我们相信，有利润作为刺激的私人企业制度对于客观地采访世界新闻是最好的保证。”
    的确，无论是合众社还是国际新闻社，都是追求利润、以私人企业制度为基础的贩卖新闻的商号。这倒是没有说错。但是，说什么为了追求利润就可以最好地保证客观地采访世界新闻，则是荒唐之词。为华尔街老板服务的美国通讯社是不会有什么客观采访的。这一点，难道不是早就为合众社和国际新闻社的无数造谣、污蔑的记录所证明了吗？
