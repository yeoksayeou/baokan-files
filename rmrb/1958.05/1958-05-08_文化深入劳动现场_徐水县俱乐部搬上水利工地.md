Culture Deepens into the Labor Site
Xushui County Club Moves to Water Conservancy Construction Site

This newspaper reports that rural cultural work in Xushui County, Hebei Province, has greatly developed. Amateur troupes and other organizations, with rural clubs as their core, can actively cooperate with production and water conservancy construction to carry out extensive activities. In order to carry out activities more widely and deeply, many clubs adopt decentralized, small-scale, and diverse ways to carry out activities.

	The Humu Township Club, in coordination with the production fertilizer accumulation and water conservancy construction movement, built four reed-mat stages throughout the township and formed seven propaganda teams for the socialist production great leap forward, with more than eighty activists participating. They adopted street broadcasts, blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, comics, and drama performances to conduct extensive propaganda activities. They also wrote and performed programs such as "Water Reservoir Serenade" at the water conservancy construction site. Activists from many local clubs bring activities to the labor site, establishing clubs at water conservancy construction sites and in the fields for production labor. Activists from clubs such as Liudongying Township brought propaganda handbooks, books, comic strips, singing materials, and activity tools to the water conservancy construction site to organize cultural sheds and carry out various activities. The Suicheng Township Club carries out activities at the water conservancy construction site in the form of blackboard newspapers, big-character posters, slogan boards, mobile picture exhibitions, broadcasts, and singing. The leap forward in rural cultural work has greatly changed the spiritual outlook of the countryside, bringing new atmospheres to production. Therefore, the county's cultural section plans to develop 259 clubs in 1958 on the basis of the existing 150 clubs, so that every commune has a club and every township has a central club, building a club activity network. At the same time, it is prepared to vigorously develop mass amateur writing organizations, developing 100 writing groups and several writing teams on the basis of the existing four writing groups. In addition, it is necessary to develop folk inherent traditional forms such as folk songs, lion dances, dragon lanterns, land boats, and wind and percussion ensembles to enrich and improve the content of club activities.
