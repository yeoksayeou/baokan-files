　　Shanghai's Lilong Neighborhoods, Purified by Rectification, Foster a Climate of Collective Concern
    Our Shanghai dispatch on the 13th (reporter Lu Ying): Two months of rectification education has had a tremendous impact on changing customs among Shanghai's million lilong residents, leading to a new atmosphere of love for the collective. In No. 3 Dunshun Lane, Luxiangyuan Road, Yimiao District, thirty-five people live together. The rectification has made the seven households in this one-story building increasingly close. Among the residents, except for one person with lung disease living in the back building who cooks alone, the other six families share three coal stoves to save fuel. This building does not have a dedicated kitchen. Xu Jiacai, a resident living in the attic on the second floor, is willing to use his rented front living room as a communal kitchen, also serving as a public passage and reception room. When Xu Jiacai and his wife go to work, Tu Guizhen, the residents' group leader, voluntarily takes care of their children. By the time the children's parents return home from work, their meals have already been cooked. Tu Guizhen also serves as the lilong's public security director. When there is a lot of work in the lilong, she is busy until late at night. When she gets home and needs to wash her own clothes, Hua Jingfang, a resident living in the front building, takes them to wash for her three out of five times. When Hua Jingfang goes out to do housework for others, she doesn't have to worry about her children or meals, as neighbors like Xu Sanmei will proactively take care of her. Chen Xigen's wife is young, and her working-class ideology has not yet been established after participating in labor. Less than six months pregnant, she made excuses to take leave and work as a temporary worker in another factory to earn extra money. Her roommates not only reported this to her organization for education, but also helped her empty chamber pots and wash diapers during her pregnancy. This patient help, from life to thought, finally touched the heart of this young female worker, enabling her to initially recognize her mistakes. These seven families live together helping each other in this way.
    In many lilong neighborhoods where workers live, such as Putuo District, Qujialang, Zhujiawan, and Heping New Village, hundreds of small red flags are hung on roofs or in front of doors every day, with the words "Night Shift, Quiet" written on them. This is a measure taken by residents to ensure that night shift workers who live there get enough sleep and to guarantee production. Children see the red flags and go to play elsewhere. Mobile vendors also lower their voices and pass by quietly when they see the red flags, making the noisy shantytown area particularly quiet. There are many, many such touching examples. In the past, some shantytown residents adopted a "not my problem" attitude towards environmental sanitation. Now, when they see muddy lanes and blocked drains, they no longer rely solely on the government to solve the problem, but volunteer to organize themselves and jointly contribute money and effort to repair them. In the past, many housewives argued over trivial matters of life and even formed "deep-seated grudges," with no one willing to openly admit their mistakes. Now, they have become more humble, and even write big-character posters to ignite self-criticism, hold unity meetings, and visit each other to proactively eliminate misunderstandings. The relationships between some neighbors who had ignored each other for many years have been significantly improved through sincere self-criticism and mutual criticism.
    The new atmosphere among lilong residents emerged after extensive airing of views, big debates, and big-character posters. In the early stages of the lilong rectification, the vast majority of residents focused on considering collective affairs from the perspective of their individual economic interests. In particular, their understanding of the two major issues of grain supply and employment was insufficient. After a serious criticism of selfish and uncooperative thinking during the debate on grain rationing, residents realized that the phenomena of lilong residents wasting grain, affecting worker-peasant unity, and endangering national interests must be quickly corrected. Residents debated the issue of employment quite enthusiastically, helping some to overcome their erroneous ideas of belittling housework and disliking low wages, leading them to be unwilling to seek employment. Under the persuasion and education of the majority of residents, thousands of temporary residents who had been waiting for employment in Shanghai for a long time and those without fixed occupations returned to their hometowns to engage in production with cheerful hearts. Currently, the Shanghai lilong rectification has launched a socialist self-education upsurge focusing on promoting the "Six Goods" (love for the country, love for the Party, good political ideology, good production/work/study, thrifty household management and good hygiene, good care for the elderly and education of children, good unity/friendship/cooperation, and good socialist morality and customs). Every household is subscribing to the "Six Goods" pledge, and everyone is striving to be a "Six Goods" activist.

### 上海里弄经过整风洗礼  关心集体开始形成风气

　　上海里弄经过整风洗礼
　　关心集体开始形成风气
    本报上海13日电　记者鲁影报道：两个月的整风教育，在上海百万里弄居民中起了移风易俗的巨大作用，出现了热爱集体的新风气。在邑庙区露香园路敦顺里三号住着大小三十五口，整风使这幢一楼一底的七户人家日益亲密起来。居民中，除了后楼有人生肺病，独自烧饭以外，其余六家为了节省燃料合用三只煤炉。这幢楼没有专门厨房，住在二层櫊楼的居民徐嘉才愿意把自己租下来的前客堂作公用厨房，并兼作公用的过道、会客室。徐嘉才夫妻出去做工，居民小组长屠桂珍便替他们义务照顾孩子，等到孩子的父母放工回家，他的饭和菜都已烧好了。屠桂珍还担任里弄治保主任，里弄中工作一多，要忙到深更半夜，等她回家要洗自己的衣服时，三回倒有两回被住在前楼的居民华静芳拿去洗了。华静芳外出帮人家家务劳动，她的孩子、饭食不用发愁，同样也有徐三妹等邻居会主动照顾她。居民陈锡根的妻子年轻，参加劳动后工人阶级思想还没有树立，怀孕不到六个月就借故请假到别的工厂作临时工赚外快，同屋人一方面向他的组织上反映，对她进行教育，同时在她怀孕期间，帮她倒马桶洗尿布，这样从生活到思想上的耐心帮助，终于打动了这位年轻女工的心，使她初步认识了错误。这七家居民就是这样你帮我我帮你地生活在一起。
    在工厂集中的普陀区、瞿家廊、朱家湾和平新村等许多工人居住的里弄中，每天有数百面小红旗挂在屋上或门前，旗上写着“夜班，静”的字样。这是居民们为使住在这里的夜班工人睡眠充足，保证生产而采取的一项措施。孩子们看到红旗就到别处去玩，流动摊贩看到红旗也都低声叫喊而过，使人多声杂的棚户地区显得格外安静。这种动人的事例是很多很多的。过去有些棚户居民对环境卫生采取你推我不管的态度，现在，他们看到泥泞的弄道和堵塞的阴沟，不再单纯依赖政府解决，而是自告奋勇地组织起来，共同出钱出力把它修好。过去很多家庭主妇为生活琐事争吵，甚至结下“深怨宿恨”，谁都不肯公开认错，现在，她们也变得虚心了，而且写大字报引火烧身，开团结会，登门拜访，主动消除隔阂。一些多年不理睬的邻居，经过诚恳的自我检讨和相互批评，关系有了显著的改进。
    里弄居民中的新风气，是经过大鸣大放大辩论以后出现的。在里弄整风的初期，广大居民是偏重于从个人经济利益出发来考虑集体事务的。特别是对粮食供应和劳动就业两大问题的认识很不足。在辩论粮食定量问题时，对自私忘公的思想进行了严肃的批判以后，居民们才感到，里弄居民浪费粮食、影响工农团结、危害国家利益的现象，必须迅速纠正。在劳动就业问题上居民们辩论得相当热烈。帮助有些人克服了轻视家务劳动、嫌工资低不愿就业等错误思想。数千个长期在上海待机就业和没有固定职业的临时户口，在大多数居民说服教育下，心情舒畅地回乡生产。当前，上海里弄整风已掀起了一个以宣传六好（爱国、爱党、政治思想好，生产、工作学习好，勤俭持家清洁卫生好，扶养老人、教育子女好，团结友爱、互相合作好，社会主义道德风气好）为内容的社会主义自我教育热潮。家家订“六好”公约，人人竞做“六好”积极分子。
