    Blooming Flowers Are Growing
    —Oroqen Children Live a Happy Life

    (Reported by this newspaper) The new generation of Oroqen people, who live in the primitive forests of the Greater Khingan Mountains, are now living a cultured and happy life.

    At present, the vast majority of school-age children in the Oroqen Autonomous Banner are enrolled in school, with primary education basically universalized. In addition, thirteen people are studying in junior high schools, normal schools, high schools, and the Central University for Nationalities in Beijing outside the banner.

    Before liberation, the cruel oppression of the reactionary ruling class meant that the Oroqen people had no schools of their own, and almost the entire population was illiterate. After liberation, the Party and the People's Government gave them deep care. Two primary schools were established in Xiao'ergou and Dayangshu, where the Oroqen Autonomous Banner population is more concentrated, one of which is a complete primary school. The state provides all the students' clothing, food, housing, long-distance travel expenses, and tuition fees. They also receive free medical care from the state when they are sick. Most of the students live in the school, and the teachers take care of them as affectionately as parents. The children like to eat meat, so the school often provides meat. Once, two children were sick and needed to drink milk. The teachers took turns going to villages eight miles away to buy milk every day, even in stormy weather. The local Oroqen elders said with emotion, "Only schools led by the Communist Party would take such good care of our children!"

    In teaching, the characteristics of the ethnic group are taken into consideration. Oroqen language is basically used in teaching. Now the children not only know Oroqen songs and dances, but also depict the lives of their own people, such as horseback riding, hunting, and the beautiful mountains and forests.

    Oroqen children are brave, lively, and fond of singing and dancing. The school pays attention to developing these advantages in teaching. On campus or at evening parties, teachers and students can often be seen dancing beautiful joyful dances, Oroqen dances, and Bear Fighting dances together. They can also often be heard singing songs such as "Ode to Chairman Mao" and "Oroqen Folk Songs." Every Sunday or holiday, older students ride horses and carry guns to go hunting. Enmisheng, Chunlin, and Qingshan are excellent young hunters, and they can often hunt roe deer, sable, and wild boar.

    The students are making rapid progress in all aspects. Most of the students have already joined the Young Pioneers. They love the country and the leader. During the spring and autumn fire prevention periods, they often assist the government in forest fire prevention work in their spare time. Two students co-wrote a poem like this:

    Who led us to turn over?
    The great leader Chairman Mao!
    We must not forget Chairman Mao's kindness,
    He gave us a paradise—the elementary school.
    Chairman Mao, we miss you, we love you,
    Like loving the sun and the moon!

    The children have also developed the habit of respecting teachers and the spirit of mutual assistance and friendship among classmates. If a classmate is sick, other classmates help him copy notes. If a younger classmate is sick, the older classmates help the teacher take him to the hospital.

    Older students already have their own beautiful ideals. I have visited more than a dozen students, and most of them have clearly stated that they want to serve the people in the future. Jiden Batu said that he wants to be a soldier of the People's Liberation Army to defend the motherland. Bai Chengrui said that when he grows up, he will learn to drive trains to facilitate transportation in the Greater Khingan Mountains. Twelve-year-old Oroqen girl Pu Chu wants to work in a health clinic in the future. Some children want to become teachers, some want to study agriculture, and some children naively said that they want to use automatic rifles to hunt more wild animals in the future.

    In the past few years, more than fifty students who have graduated from primary schools in the banner and entered secondary schools and further into the Central University for Nationalities, or who have joined revolutionary work. Among them, He Qiyinggui was gloriously admitted to the Communist Party of China shortly after being elected as a model youth league member of the whole banner, and is now working as the deputy secretary of the Nūtūk (district) Committee of the CPC.

    艳丽的花朵在成长
    ——鄂伦春少年儿童过着幸福的生活
    本报讯  生活在大兴安岭原始森林中的鄂伦春人的新生一代，正在过着有文化的幸福生活。
    目前，鄂伦春自治旗的绝大部分学龄儿童已经入学，基本上普及了小学教育，并且有十三人正在旗外初中、师范、高中和北京中央民族学院学习。
    解放以前，反动统治阶级的残酷压榨，使鄂伦春民族没有自己的学校，人民群众几乎全是文盲。解放后，党和人民政府给予了深切关怀，在鄂伦春自治旗人口较集中的小二沟和大杨树建立了两处小学，其中有一所是完全小学。对学生们的衣、食、住、远途上学旅费和学习费用等全部由国家供给。他们生病了，也由国家免费医疗。学生们多数集中在学校住宿，教师们像父母一样亲切地照料着他们。孩子们喜欢吃肉，学校就经常供给肉食。有一次有两个小朋友生病了，需要吃牛奶，教师们每天轮流到八里以外的村落去买牛奶，遇上狂风骤雨天也不耽误。当地鄂伦春老乡感动地说：“只有共产党领导的学校，才会这样爱护我们的孩子啊！”
    在教学中，照顾了民族特点。基本上采用鄂伦春语言教课。现在孩子们不仅会鄂伦春歌舞，还会描绘自己民族的生活，如骑马打猎和优美的山林等。
    鄂伦春小朋友们的性格勇敢、活泼、爱好歌舞。学校在教学中注意发扬他们的这些优点。在校园里或晚会上，经常可以看到老师和学生们一起跳着优美的快乐舞、鄂伦春舞和熊斗舞；也经常可以听到他们唱着“歌颂毛主席”和“鄂伦春小调”等歌曲。每逢星期日或假期，大一些的学生就骑马背枪打猎去了。恩米生、春林和青山是优秀的小猎手，他们常常可以打到麅子、猂和野猪。
    学生们在各方面的进步都很快。多数学生已带上了红领巾。他们热爱国家和领袖。每当春、秋防火期，他们就常在课余协助政府作森林防火工作。有两个学生合写过这样一首诗：
    谁领导我们翻了身？
    伟大的领袖毛主席！
    毛主席的恩情不能忘掉，
    他让我们有了乐园——小学校。
    毛主席，我们想念您我们热爱您，
    像爱日月一样！
    小朋友们还养成了尊敬老师的习惯和同学们之间互助友爱的精神。有的同学生病了，别的同学就帮助他抄笔记。小同学病了，大同学就帮助老师把他送到医院去。
    大一些的学生，已经有了自己美好的理想。我曾访问过十几名学生，他们大部分都明确地表示将来要为人民服务。吉登巴图说他将来要当一名解放军战士，保卫祖国。白成瑞说，长大要学习开火车，为了使大兴安岭交通方便。十二岁的鄂伦春小女孩普础将来要去卫生院工作。有的小朋友要当教师，有的要学农业，还有的小朋友很天真地说，他将来要用自动步枪打猎，多多猎获野物。
    几年来，从旗内小学毕业升入中等学校和进一步升入中央民族学院的学生，或参加了革命工作的人，已有五十多人。其中，何其英贵在被选为全旗模范青年团员不久，即光荣地加入了中国共产党，现在正担任中共努图克（区）委员会副书记的工作。　（白皓）（附图片）
