    Guilty Conscience
    Eisenhower recently said that the United States is pursuing a neutral policy towards the war in Indonesia to quell the rebels, and that he does not know of any Americans who, as Prime Minister Juanda has accused, are flying planes for the Indonesian rebels.
    Eisenhower's remarks were very carefully worded. If the US government had a clear conscience, he could have spoken more definitively and stopped there. Strangely, Eisenhower was not reassured and went on to say: In the Indonesian war, "If any Americans are involved, they will be adventurers who often participate in such battles for money or adventure."
    These latter remarks were to supplement the former. Why the supplement? Because of a guilty conscience! It is well known that the United States has been interfering in the war in Indonesia to quell the rebels; if Eisenhower had only said the former remarks, everyone would have thought he was too dishonest!

    做贼心虚
    艾森豪威尔最近说，美国对印度尼西亚肃清叛乱分子的战争是奉行中立政策的，他不知道有任何美国人像朱安达总理所指责的那样，在为印度尼西亚叛乱分子驾驶飞机。
    艾森豪威尔的这段话，是说得极有分寸的。如果美国政府问心无愧，他本来可以说得再肯定一些，并且说到这里就可以带住了。奇怪的是，艾森豪威尔却不放心，接着又说了下面的话：在印度尼西亚的战争中，“如果牵连到任何美国人的话，他们将是一些冒险家，这些人似乎经常不是为了金钱就是为了冒险而参与这样的战斗的”。
    后面这些话是为了补充前面那段话的。为什么要补充呢？因为做贼心虚！在印度尼西亚肃清叛乱分子的战争中，美国一直在进行干涉，这是尽人皆知的事；艾森豪威尔如果只说前面那些话，大家就会认为他太不真实了！
