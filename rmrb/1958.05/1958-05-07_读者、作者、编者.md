    Very fond of street poetry
    After seeing the street poems published in the People's Daily on April 18, many comrades in our unit felt very good about them. These poems are novel in form, moving in subject matter, and reflect the face of the motherland leaping forward and changing every day. We, the volunteer comrades far away from the motherland, are so willing to understand the situation of the motherland and our hometown through these short, concise, easy-to-understand, and simple poems!
    Our soldiers prefer this form of street poetry. We hope that poets, writers, and comrades who are engaged in amateur writing in rural areas, factories, enterprises, organs, and schools will use the form of street poetry to sing about our motherland!
    A certain unit of the Volunteer Army, Zhang Kefu
    
    Publish more articles like this
    After reading the two articles "When Subordinates' Opinions Are Wrong" and "Is It Difficult to Have Heart-to-Heart Talks?" published on the fourth page of the People's Daily on April 1st and 2nd, I felt very good about them. The problems mentioned in the articles are things we encounter every day. People often regard these problems as "small problems" and disdain to talk about them. Sometimes I also feel that there are some problems in these things (such as superiors not treating subordinates with an equal attitude), but people also think that this is a matter of course.
    Now the newspaper has raised these issues, arousing the attention of everyone, especially leading comrades, which is of great benefit to the relationship between superiors and subordinates and to the improvement of leadership style. In the future, I hope that the People's Daily will publish more articles like this to discuss issues of universal significance in people's work and life.

    Hopes of sports enthusiasts
    I am a sports enthusiast, and I like to read reports and articles about sports. But whenever I pick up the People's Daily, I am disappointed. The People's Daily has so few reports in this area! I hope that the People's Daily can strengthen the following two points in the future:
    1. Publish some sports knowledge in a timely manner. For example, there are more people practicing long-distance running and skating in winter, so articles on how to practice long-distance running and skating should be published at this time.
    2. The peak season for sports competitions has arrived, and I hope to report more domestic and foreign sports news.

    We adopted these suggestions
    Some of the suggestions published in the "My Suggestion" column on the fourth page of the People's Daily, although small, have a certain positive significance. For example, after reading the suggestion "Using Torn Calendar Paper" published on March 12, we used the calendar paper torn off every day as a loose-leaf notepad. Another example is the suggestion "City Posters Should Also Be Elegant" published on March 28th. Many "poster columns" (opened on blank walls) have appeared at various traffic hubs and eye-catching places in our Fuzhou City.

    This is really a new atmosphere!
    Before the Double-Anti Movement, readers in Liu'an, Anhui, saw the People's Daily at the earliest every other day, and sometimes they had to wait three days. Since the start of the Double-Anti Movement, the Liu'an Post and Telecommunications Bureau has delivered four times a day, so that readers can see the previous day's People's Daily at around 6 p.m. Comrades praised: This is really a new atmosphere brought about by the Double-Anti Movement!

    It is best to have one song a week
    The "Half-Month Song" column newly opened by the People's Daily is very popular among readers. Like the "March of Young Workers", it is short, concise, and easy to learn to sing. Everyone needs such mass songs. However, only one song is published every half a month, which is a little too little. I suggest publishing more, preferably one song a week.

    非常喜欢街头诗
    看到人民日报4月18日刊登的街头诗，我们部队许多同志都感觉很好。这些诗形式新颖，题材动人，反映了祖国天天在跃进、天天在变化的面貌。我们远离祖国的志愿军同志，多么愿意通过这些短小精悍、通俗易懂、朴素无华的诗篇了解祖国和家乡的情况啊！
    街头诗这种形式，我们战士更喜欢它。希望诗人、作家们和农村、工厂、企业、机关、学校从事业余写作的同志，多多利用街头诗的形式歌唱我们的祖国吧！

    多登这样的文章
    读了人民日报4月1日、2日四版上登的“当下级的意见错误的时候”和“谈心难不难？”两篇文章，感到很好。文章中所提到的问题，都是我们日常碰到的事。人们往往把这些问题看成是“小问题”，不屑谈及。有时也感到在这些事情上有些问题（如上级不以平等态度对待下级），但是人们也认为这是天经地义的。
    现在报纸把这些问题提出来，引起大家特别是领导同志的注意，这对上下级关系、对领导作风的改进是大有好处的。今后希望人民日报多选登这样的文章，讨论人们工作中、生活中带有普遍意义的问题。

    体育爱好者的希望
    我是个体育爱好者，我很喜欢看体育运动方面的报道和文章。但是每当拿起人民日报的时候，我就失望了。人民日报这方面的报道少得可怜！我希望人民日报今后能从以下两点加强：
    1、适时地刊登些体育知识。如冬季练长跑和滑冰的较多，这时就应该刊载些关于怎样练长跑和滑冰的文章。
    2、目前体育运动的竞赛旺季已来临了，希望能更多地报道国内外体育运动新闻。

    我们采纳了这些建议
    人民日报第四版上“我的建议”栏里发表的一些建议，事情虽小，但都有一定的积极意义。如3月12日刊登了“利用撕下的日历纸”的建议，我们看了后，就把每天撕下的日历纸当作活页记事簿用。又如3月28日刊登了“城市的招贴也得讲究”的建议，我们抚州市的各交通要口及引人注目的地方就出现了很多“招贴专栏”（在空白墙壁上开辟的）。

    这真是新气象！
    双反运动以前，我们安徽六安读者看到人民日报最快也得隔两天，有时要隔三天才能看到。自从双反运动开始以来，六安邮电局每天投递四次，使读者在晚上六点多钟就可以看到前一天的人民日报了。同志们都称赞说：这真是双反运动带来的新气象！

    最好是每周一歌
    人民日报新辟的“半月一歌”一栏，深受读者的欢迎。像“青年工人进行曲”，短小精悍，容易学唱，大家很需要这样的群众歌曲。但是半月才只一支歌，嫌少了些。我建议多登一些，最好是每周一歌。
