Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch: The Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by Xu Zhenshook, visited wounded Chinese People's Volunteer Army soldiers at the Chinese People's Liberation Army Plastic Surgery Hospital at noon today. These soldiers were seriously wounded in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea and had not yet recovered.

More than a dozen wounded Volunteer Army soldiers gathered in a quiet reception room to meet with the distinguished guests, who presented them with large bouquets of flowers. Delegation Leader Xu Zhenshook said with great emotion that the comrades shed their blood and gave everything on our country's soil for the democracy, freedom, and independence of Korea. The Korean people will never forget the great achievements of the Volunteer Army and will never allow the comrades' blood to be shed in vain. We must complete the cause of peaceful reunification of the motherland, and we must build our motherland to be even stronger and more beautiful. Delegation Leader Xu Zhenshook also brought the greetings of all the Korean people to the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers, hoping that the wounded soldiers would demonstrate the same fearless spirit that they showed on the Korean battlefield against the American aggressors, overcome their injuries, and recover their health as soon as possible.

Chen Qi, the representative of the wounded Volunteer Army soldiers, told the distinguished guests that they felt it was a great honor to shed their blood on the heroic Korean land. They are very grateful for the meticulous care and attention given to them by the people of China and Korea after they were injured, and they will strive to recover their health as soon as possible. He said that if the US imperialists dare to venture into Korea again, as long as the Korean people need it, they will cross the Yalu River without hesitation to defend "our second motherland."

Before leaving, the distinguished guests presented the wounded soldiers with commemorative medals.

    朝鲜贵宾探望志愿军伤员
    许贞琡团长致以亲切问候
    据新华社7日讯　以许贞琡为首的朝鲜人民访华代表团，今天中午到中国人民解放军整形外科医院，探望了在抗美援朝战争中重伤未愈的中国人民志愿军伤员。
    十几名志愿军伤员聚集在一座雅静的会客室里同贵宾们会见，贵宾们把大束鲜花赠送给他们。许贞琡团长极为激动地说，同志们为了朝鲜的民主、自由和独立，在我们祖国的土地上流下了鲜血，献出了自己的一切。朝鲜人民永远不会忘记志愿军的丰功伟绩，也绝不能让同志们的鲜血白白流掉，我们一定要完成和平统一祖国的事业，一定要把我们的祖国建设得更加强大和美丽。许贞琡团长还带来了全体朝鲜人民对志愿军伤员的问候，希望伤员们拿出在朝鲜战场上抗击美国侵略者的那种大无畏的精神，战胜伤痛，早日恢复健康。
    志愿军伤员代表陈奇告诉贵宾们，他们认为自己在英雄的朝鲜国土上流下了鲜血，是一件十分光荣的事情，他们非常感谢朝中两国人民在他们受伤以后给予的无微不至的关怀和照顾，并且争取早日恢复健康。他说，如果美帝国主义敢于再次在朝鲜冒险，只要朝鲜人民需要，他们就将毫不迟疑地跨过鸭绿江保卫“我们的第二祖国”。
    在离开以前，贵宾们向伤员们赠送了纪念章。
