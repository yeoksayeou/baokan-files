Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 14th: The Wuhan Philosophical Society held a symposium on the 13th to commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." More than 300 philosophy and social science workers and researchers from the Wuhan area attended the symposium.

　　Zeng Chun, Director of the Propaganda Department of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, said in his speech that Chairman Mao's article, using the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoints, and methods, made clear and vivid expositions on the major and critical issues of modern socialist revolution and socialist construction, greatly enriching the treasure trove of Marxist-Leninist theory. He said that the scientific nature, truthfulness, and great practical significance of this article have been confirmed by the practice of the past year, and its spirit has been implemented among the broad masses of our country. Through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the people of our country have not only recognized the nature of the two types of contradictions, but also used the spirit of this article as a key to resolving contradictions among the people, uniting 600 million people to build socialism, thus creating a great leap forward in political thought and a high tide in production in our country.

　　Zeng Chun said that modern revisionism is more dangerous than dogmatism. It even fantasizes about a communist crisis in an attempt to save capitalism from its doomed fate. Modern revisionism uses the method of substitution, wearing the cloak of Marxism to carry out anti-Marxist activities. Reviewing Chairman Mao's work will greatly help us improve our political acumen, distinguish right from wrong, and achieve victory in criticizing modern revisionism.

　　Li Fanfu, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Philosophical Society, pointed out that Chairman Mao's article pointed out the direction for our Chinese revolution. Due to its high degree of Marxist principle and scientific nature, it has given us the sharpest weapon to oppose revisionism and overcome dogmatism. We must better study and apply the spirit of this article to solve problems in our actual work. At present, the creations of the masses in practice are rich and colorful. Philosophy and social science workers should use this article as a weapon to study and summarize practical work, so as to better serve industrial and agricultural production.

　　Li Erzhong, Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Meng Futang, Vice Governor of Hubei Province, Li Shao Cen a social science worker, and social science workers from some universities and colleges, all used a large number of facts from themselves, their cities, and their units to prove the tremendous and endless power of Chairman Mao's article in solving practical and theoretical work. The meeting was presided over by Li Fanfu.

　　武汉哲学学会纪念“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年
    掌握武器批判现代修正主义
    新华社武汉14日电　武汉哲学学会13日举行座谈会，纪念毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年。参加这次座谈会的有武汉地区哲学、社会科学工作者和研究者三百多人。
    中共湖北省委宣传部部长曾淳在发言中说，毛主席的这篇文章，运用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，对现代社会主义革命、社会主义建设的重大关键性问题作了鲜明和生动的论述，大大丰富了马克思列宁主义理论的宝库。他说，这篇文章的科学性、真理性和巨大的现实意义，已经被一年来的实践所证实，它的精神已经贯彻到我国广大群众中去。我国人民经过反右派斗争、整风运动，不仅认清了两类矛盾的性质，而且把这篇文章的精神作为解决人民内部矛盾、团结六亿人民建设社会主义的钥匙，从而在我国出现了政治思想上大跃进、生产大高潮。
    曾淳说，现代修正主义比教条主义更加危险，它还幻想共产主义危机企图挽救资本主义的死亡命运。现代修正主义用偷天换日的方法，披着马克思主义的外衣，进行反马克思主义的活动。我们重温毛主席的这篇著作，会大大帮助我们提高政治嗅觉，辨清大是大非，取得批判现代修正主义的胜利。
    武汉哲学学会副主任委员李凡夫指出，毛主席的文章给我们中国革命指出了前进方向，由于它的高度的马克思主义的原则性、科学性，因而给了我们反对修正主义和克服教条主义以最锐利的武器。我们要更好地学习和运用这篇文章的精神实质，解决实际工作中的问题。目前，群众在实践中的创造是丰富多采的，哲学社会科学工作者应当以这篇文章作为武器，研究和总结实际工作，从而更好地为工农业生产服务。
    中共武汉市委书记李尔重、湖北省副省长孟夫唐、社会科学工作者黎少岑及部分大专学校社会科学工作者，都用本身、本市、本单位的大量事实，证实了毛主席这篇文章的理论在解决实际工作和理论工作中所起到的巨大的无穷无尽的威力。这次会议由李凡夫主持的。
