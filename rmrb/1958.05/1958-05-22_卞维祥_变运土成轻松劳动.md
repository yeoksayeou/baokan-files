    Bian Weixiang - Transforming Soil Transportation into Easy Labor
    At the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition's water conservancy construction tool demonstration area, a man of medium height was demonstrating a single-person hand-cranked, foot-pedaled double-wire aerial soil transporter, attracting batch after batch of visitors. The person operating and demonstrating this aerial soil transporter sat on a chair with a backrest, easily and happily turning a hand-operated winch and stepping on foot pedals. The flywheel at one end of the winch rotated, and two hemp ropes on the winch pulled two boxes, each loaded with a hundred catties of mud, back and forth on the two iron wires of the aerial cableway. Each box had a hidden latch that, when it hit a stake buried on the slope, would automatically open the bottom, and the mud would be unloaded. The demonstrator explained to the visitors that this tool could transport soil from a low place to a height of thirty meters. It was also suitable for transporting soil across rivers and ponds, and its efficiency was five to six times higher than manual carrying. In addition, it was simple in structure, low in cost, and could be manufactured with locally sourced materials.
    This demonstrator is Bian Weixiang, the winner of the first prize for advanced water control tools in Anhui Province this year. He is a carpenter from Anfeng Second Cooperative in Shouxian County, Anhui Province, and the single-person hand-cranked, foot-pedaled double-wire aerial soil transporter is his invention.
    In order to strive for a bumper rice harvest this year, the Anfeng Second Cooperative mobilized all its members in October of last year to dig a large pond and four ditches. The members dug out the very thick silt that had accumulated in the pond and ditches, and used two people to crank a winch and pulley to pull it ashore, then two more people carried the baskets and dumped them, which was very laborious.
    After several days of hard thinking, Bian Weixiang remembered seeing electric trams on the streets of Shanghai more than ten years ago, powered by electric wires; he thought of the side-tipping carts used by workers to push coal in the Huainan coal mine that could automatically unload coal; and he thought of the four wheels of a pulley sliding on wooden rails. Combining these ideas, after many experiments, he finally successfully created this aerial soil transporter. (Su Qun)

    卞维祥——变运土成轻松劳动
    在全国农具展览会水利施工工具表演场里，一个中等身材的人在表演单人手摇脚踏双丝空中运土器，吸引着一批一批前来参观的人。操作表演这空中运土器的人，坐在靠背的椅子上，轻松愉快地用手摇辘轳，脚踏蹬踏板，辘轳一端的飞轮即旋转起来，辘轳上两根麻绳拉着两个各装载百斤泥土的箱子，在空中架索的两根铁丝上，来回交错地奔驰着。箱子有一个暗闩，碰到坡上埋的桩，箱底即自动打开，泥土随之卸掉。表演者向参观的人介绍说：用这工具能把低处的泥土运送到三十公尺的高处上去，它又适合跨河跨塘运送泥土，效率比人挑抬提高五倍到六倍。另外，构造简单，造价低廉，制造可以就地取材。
    这位表演者是今年安徽省先进治水工具一等奖获得者卞维祥。他是安徽省寿县安丰二社的木工，单人手摇脚踏双丝空中运土器就是他发明创造的。
    安丰二社为了争取今年水稻的大丰收，在去年10月动员全社的社员开挖一处大塘和四条沟。社员们把塘里和沟里淤积很厚很厚的污泥挖出，用两个人绞辘轳滑车拉上岸，再用两个人抬着框倒，非常吃力。
    卞维祥经过数天的苦思，想起了十多年前他在上海马路上看到电车上的电线带动电车跑的事；想到在淮南煤矿看工人推煤用的歪歪车能自动卸煤的事；又想到滑车四个轮在木轨上滑行的事，把这些合在一块，经过多次试验，他终于创造成功这部空中运土器。　（苏群）
