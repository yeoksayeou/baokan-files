Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Guo Moruo, Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said at a grand banquet held tonight by the Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yongho: The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people fully support the solemn position of the Chinese and Korean governments in their reply yesterday to the notes of the countries of the United Nations forces.

Guo Moruo said: If the United States has the slightest concern for the desire of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and the desire of the people of all countries for the relaxation of international tensions, it should follow the example of the Chinese People's Volunteers and immediately withdraw all its troops from South Korea. Other countries participating in the United Nations forces, of course, cannot be an exception. We firmly believe that the correct propositions put forward by the governments of China and North Korea for the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and the easing of the tense situation in the Far East will continue to receive the support of peace-loving people around the world. The just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory.

This grand banquet was held for the visiting delegation of the Korean people to China. Head of the delegation, Xu Zhenshu, also said in his speech: We fully support the reply made by the governments of China and North Korea yesterday to the notes of the countries of the United Nations forces. We will continue to work hard to implement the plan for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

These remarks by Guo Moruo and Xu Zhenshu were warmly welcomed by the people attending the banquet.

Tonight, Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Chen Shutong, Liao Chengzhi, Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice Shi Liang, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Gan Siqi, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan and people from all walks of life in China, a total of more than 200 people, attended the banquet.

Guo Moruo also said in his speech that we are very pleased that in such an extraordinary spring, when the people of China and North Korea are striding forward vigorously along the road of socialism, the friendly relations between the people of China and North Korea have also been greatly developed. He strongly condemned the heinous acts of U.S. imperialism in continuing to occupy South Korea. He pointed out that just as the people of all countries in the world are expecting the United Nations forces headed by the United States to withdraw completely from South Korea as well, the U.S. government has not only failed to take any positive measures on the issue of troop withdrawal, but has continued to seriously undermine the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to step up the creation of a tense situation in the Far East and further strengthen its control over South Korea, U.S. imperialism has illegally transported a large number of new weapons into South Korea and has continuously conducted atomic warfare exercises near the Korean Demilitarized Zone. This arrogant provocative act cannot but arouse the serious vigilance of peace-loving countries and peoples.

In his speech, Xu Zhenshu said that during our stay in Beijing, we personally experienced everywhere the deep concern and love expressed by the Chinese people to the Korean people through our delegation, and we spent every day in gratitude and excitement. Obviously, this sentiment comes from the traditional love and sublime proletarian internationalist friendship forged by the people of China and North Korea through a long history with blood. We will convey to the Korean people in detail your warm reception to us, the unparalleled friendship of the Chinese people to the Korean people, and the leap forward in socialist construction.

Xu Zhenshu said: The friendship and unity between the people of China and North Korea are unbreakable. We firmly believe that the traditional friendship and unity forged by our two peoples, who are closely united in the unified family of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, through a long history cannot be destroyed by any force in the world.

At the beginning of the banquet, the host of the banquet, Ambassador Li Yongho, delivered a speech to welcome all his guests.

In this friendly gathering, the guests and hosts gave each other red roses, and the female comrades of the Korean Embassy sang moving Korean folk songs on the spot.

Before the banquet, a cocktail party was also held.

    郭沫若在朝鲜大使的招待会上说
    联合国军应立即撤出朝鲜
    新华社7日讯　和大主席郭沫若今晚在朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐举行的盛大宴会上讲话中说：中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民完全支持中朝两国政府在昨天答复联合国军各国照会中的严正立场。
    郭沫若说：如果美国对朝鲜人民要求祖国和平统一和世界各国人民要求缓和国际紧张局势的愿望有丝毫关心的话，就应该仿效中国人民志愿军的榜样，立即撤出它在南朝鲜的全部军队。其他参加联合国军的国家当然不能有所例外。我们坚决相信，朝中两国政府为和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势所提出的正确主张，一定会继续得到世界爱好和平人民的支持。朝鲜人民为和平统一祖国而进行的正义斗争，一定能够取得最后的胜利。
    这个盛大宴会是为朝鲜人民访华代表团访问中国举行的。许贞琡团长在讲话中也说：我们完全支持朝中两国政府昨天对联合国军各国照会中所作的答复。我们将继续努力贯彻和平统一我们祖国的方案。
    郭沫若和许贞琡的这番话，受到了出席宴会的人们的热烈欢迎。
    今晚，国务院副总理贺龙，人大常委会副委员长李济深，和大副主席陈叔通、廖承志，内务部长谢觉哉，司法部长史良，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇，外交部副部长曾涌泉和中国各方面的人士，共二百多人，出席了宴会。
    郭沫若在讲话中还说，我们非常高兴，在这样一个不平凡的春天里，在中朝两国人民都在朝气蓬勃地沿着社会主义大道阔步前进的时候，中朝两国人民的友好关系也得到了重大的发展。他严厉谴责了美帝国主义继续霸占南朝鲜的罪恶行为。他指出：正当世界各国人民期待着以美国为首的联合国军也能同样从南朝鲜全部撤退的时候，美国政府却在撤军问题上不仅没有采取任何积极措施，反而不断对朝鲜停战协定进行严重的破坏。美帝国主义为了加紧制造远东紧张局势和进一步加强对南朝鲜的控制，已经非法地向南朝鲜运入了大量的新式武器，并且连续在朝鲜非军事区附近举行了原子作战演习，这种狂妄的挑衅行为，不能不引起爱好和平的国家和人民的严重警惕。
    许贞琡团长在讲话中说，在逗留北京的期间，我们到处亲身体验到中国人民通过我们代表团向朝鲜人民所表示的深切关怀和热爱，我们在感激和兴奋中度过了每一天。显然，这种情感是出自朝中两国人民通过长久的历史，用鲜血结成的传统友爱和崇高的无产阶级国际主义的友谊。我们将把你们这次对我们的盛情款待和中国人民对朝鲜人民的无比友爱，以及在社会主义建设中飞跃发展的面貌，详尽地转告给朝鲜人民。
    许贞琡说：朝中两国人民的友谊和团结是牢不可破的。我们坚信，紧紧团结在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营统一的大家庭中的我们两国人民通过长期的历史结成的传统的友谊和团结，是世界上没有任何力量可以摧毁的。
    在宴会开始的时候，宴会的主人——李永镐大使曾致词欢迎他的全体客人。
    在这个充满友谊的聚会里，宾主相互赠送红色的玫瑰花，朝鲜大使馆的女同志还即席演唱了动人的朝鲜民歌。
    在宴会以前，还举行了酒会。
