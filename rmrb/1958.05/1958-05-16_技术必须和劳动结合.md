　　Technology Must Be Combined with Labor
    All scientific and technological knowledge in books is the accumulated experience of previous generations in the struggle for production; we must learn it. However, if technical workers want to use the technical knowledge of predecessors or outsiders to solve the practical problems in current production, they must specifically apply it in combination with the specific conditions of their own country, region, and unit. To do this, they cannot just sit in the office, but must go deep into the field and participate in labor with the workers. Through labor, and according to the conditions of their own unit, they must combine the technical knowledge in books with production, so that technology and labor are combined. After doing this, they can also absorb the new production struggle experiences of the worker comrades to enrich and develop their own book knowledge and skills. That is to say, technical personnel can better serve production and develop their own technology only by combining technology and labor. In this regard, the engineering and technical personnel in Taiyuan City, working with leading cadres to develop experimental furnaces and experimental workshops, is a very good example.
    Engineering and technical personnel engaged in "experimental workshops" not only learn from workers, participate in labor, and further enrich and enhance their technical capabilities, but also, through joint labor with workers, learn the collectivist spirit, selfless devotion, and hardworking and simple virtues of the working class. They can also change the bourgeois ideas of bourgeois intellectuals, such as despising manual labor, not treating workers with an equal attitude, and pursuing personal fame and gain, in labor and life. Therefore, the method of going to the field to engage in "experimental workshops" and "experimental furnaces" is also a good way to gradually make technical personnel into technical cadres who have a working-class stand and a Marxist worldview, and who are truly both red and expert.

　　技术必须和劳动结合
    一切书本上的科学技术知识，都是前人生产斗争的经验积累；我们必须学习。然而，技术工作者要运用前人或外人的技术知识来解决当前生产中的实际问题，就必须要结合本国、本地区、本单位的具体情况来具体运用。要这样做，就不能只蹲在办公室里，而必须要深入到现场去，和工人一道参加劳动，通过劳动，根据本单位情况，把书本上的技术知识和生产结合起来，使技术和劳动结合起来。这样做了以后，还可以吸取工人同志们新的生产斗争的经验，来充实和发展自己的书本知识和技能。也就是说，技术人员只有把技术和劳动相结合，才能更好地为生产服务并使自己的技术得到发展。在这方面，太原市的工程技术人员和领导干部一起搞试验炉、试验车间，是一个很好的例子。
    工程技术人员搞“试验车间”，除了向工人学习，参加劳动，更加充实、丰富自己的技术能力外，还可以通过和工人的共同劳动，学习工人阶级的集体主义精神和克己奉公勤劳朴实的高贵品质，在劳动和生活中改变资产阶级知识分子那种轻视体力劳动、不以平等态度对待工人、追求个人名利等资产阶级思想。因此，下现场搞“试验车间”“试验炉”的办法，也是使技术人员逐步成为有工人阶级立场和马克思主义世界观，成为一个名副其实的又红又专的技术干部的好办法。
