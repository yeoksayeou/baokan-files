    Unbridled Atrocity
    By People's Daily Commentator
    On April 28, the "Flying Swan," a Hong Kong vessel belonging to the Jiehe Company, was bombed by American aircraft while anchored in an Indonesian port. Of the twenty-six Chinese sailors from Hong Kong working on the ship, nine have been confirmed dead and six are missing. The news has aroused immense indignation among Chinese sailors in Hong Kong. They have unanimously condemned the American aircraft for assisting Indonesian rebels in indiscriminately bombing peaceful merchant ships and massacring Chinese sailors.
    The United States, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, is assisting rebel elements in bombing vast areas of eastern Indonesia. Its aim is to directly aid the rebel group and prevent the Indonesian government from advancing towards another stronghold of the rebel group (North Sulawesi). Their use of aircraft to indiscriminately bomb foreign merchant ships sailing in Indonesian waters is a conspiracy to complicate the situation in Indonesia, so as to further interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs amid the chaos. It is precisely because of this that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique have reached a point of unbridled lawlessness!
    This criminal action by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is not only a provocation against Indonesia, but also a blatant violation of the most basic principles of international law. If the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique stubbornly continue their reckless actions, then the peace and security of Asia will inevitably be subjected to even more serious threats. Therefore, the governments and people of Asian countries, as well as the governments and people of all countries around the world who are concerned about the situation in Indonesia, must not tolerate the continued reckless actions of the American imperialists and their accomplices. This atrocity must be stopped quickly.

    无法无天的暴行
    本报评论员
    4月28日停泊在印度尼西亚港口的香港捷和公司所属的“飞雁轮”被美国飞机炸毁。在这艘轮船上工作的二十六个香港中国海员中已证实有九人被炸死，六人失踪。消息传来，引起了香港中国海员的无比愤慨。他们一致声讨美国飞机协助印度尼西亚叛军滥炸和平商船、屠杀中国海员的暴行。
    美国同蒋介石集团串通一气协助叛乱分子轰炸印度尼西亚东部的广大地区，其目的是要直接援助叛乱集团，阻止印度尼西亚政府向叛乱集团盘踞的另一阵地（北苏拉威西）进军。他们使用飞机对在印度尼西亚海面上航行的外国商船滥施轰炸，则是阴谋使印度尼西亚的局势复杂化，以便于在混乱状态中进一步干涉印度尼西亚内政。正是因为这样，美国和蒋介石集团竟然到了无法无天的地步！
    美国和蒋介石集团的这种罪恶行动，不仅是对印度尼西亚的挑衅，而且也是公然破坏起码的国际法准则。美国和蒋介石集团如果悍然蛮干下去，那么，亚洲的和平和安全也必然将遭到更加严重的威胁。因此亚洲各国政府和人民以及全世界所有关心印度尼西亚局势的各国政府和人民，决不能容忍美帝国主义者及其帮凶继续进行无法无天的冒险行动。这种暴行必须迅速加以制止。
