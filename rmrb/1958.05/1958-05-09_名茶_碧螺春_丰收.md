    Famous Tea "Biluochun" Has a Bumper Harvest
    The famous tea "Biluochun," produced on the east and west hills of Dongting Mountain in Taihu Lake, has been put on the market in succession, with more than 300 dan. Compared with the same period last year, the output has increased more than threefold, and the quality is also good. In the past, the "Mingqian Tea" picked before the Qingming Festival was very small in quantity. Last year, only 14 jin were picked on the east hill, and there was no "Mingqian Tea" on the west hill. This year, the east and west hills produced more than 900 jin of "Mingqian Tea" in total. This is a new event that has never happened in the local tea picking history.

    名茶“碧螺春”丰收
    名茶“碧螺春”丰收。这种出产于太湖中洞庭东西两山上的茶叶已陆续上市三百多担，与去年同期相比，增产三倍以上，而且质量好。往年在清明以前采制的“明前茶”为数很少，去年东山上只采制了十四斤，西山上没有“明前茶”。今年东西二山“明前茶”共产了九百多斤。这是当地采茶史上从来没有过的新鲜事。
