　　Setting an Example for Children
　　Xu Zhuan
　　Two-year-old Jingjing, kneeling on a chair, held a small thin stick and划来划去 on a piece of paper on the table. After划来划去 for a while, she甩一甩 the small stick next to the chair. This is obviously imitating adults writing. But why did she 甩一甩 after writing for a while? It turned out that her mother's fountain pen didn't work smoothly, and she had to 甩一甩 it after writing for a while. Although Jingjing didn't understand why her mother 甩, she was also carefully imitating it.
　　Three-and-a-half-year-old Xiaoxian, sitting on a small chair close to the small table, used small scissors to cut white paper into small squares, and then pasted them on another large piece of paper with paste. I thought she was using small squares of paper to paste patterns, so I casually praised her and said, "Xiaoxian is so capable, she can paste flowers." She solemnly said, "It's not pasting flowers, it's a mistake!" She also showed a very regretful expression, and kept saying, "Alas! A mistake! Alas! A mistake!" It turned out that her mother had been copying a document these days, and sometimes she would paste small squares of paper to correct mistakes, and of course, she also expressed regret. Therefore, the child observed everything next to her, and naturally imitated it, even some subtle movements and expressions were reflected.
　　Two-and-a-half-year-old Xiaolan said to the doll: You are disobedient, you are not good, I will take you outside, I don't want you. She also said: You are not good, I won't bring you candy. This fully reflects her mother's attitude towards her. It also reflects her mother's incorrect educational methods of "threat" and "enticement", which affects the child's attitude towards others.
　　Six-year-old Shengli is a very lively and active boy. He likes to hit and scold people in kindergarten. Although he has been continuously educated by the teacher, he still hasn't corrected it. The teacher advised him: Look at our kindergarten, no one hits or scolds people, the teachers don't hit or scold people, and the children don't hit or scold people. Good children don't hit or scold people. Why do you like to hit and scold people? Shengli said very affirmatively: My dad likes to hit and scold people, and he even hits my mom!
　　The above examples fully illustrate that preschool children are keen observers. They can observe some subtle things that adults have not noticed, and can imitate them realistically. Even the actions they cannot understand, they are carefully imitating. However, at this age, children's ability to distinguish between right and wrong is very weak. They only know how to imitate, and they don't know which ones are right and which ones are wrong. Therefore, the adults around the children, especially the parents who are closest to the children, must strictly demand themselves, pay attention to their words and deeds, every move, set an example for the children, and influence the children's behavior. As the saying goes, "Those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black." The example of adults has a profound impact on children.

　　给孩子树立榜样
　　徐篆
    两岁的晶晶，跪在椅子上，手里拿着一个小细棍，在桌子上的一张纸上划来划去，划一会，就把小棍在椅子旁边甩一甩。这很明显是在摹仿成人写字。但是，她为什么写一会甩一甩呢？原来是她妈妈的自来水钢笔有些不下水，写一会就要甩一甩。晶晶虽然不理解妈妈为什么甩，但是她也在认真的摹仿着。
    三岁半的小娴，坐在靠近小桌的小椅子上，用小剪子把白纸剪成小方块，再用浆糊贴在另一张大纸上。我以为她在用小方纸块贴图案花纹呢，就随便夸奖她一句说：“小娴真能干，会贴花了”。她很郑重地说：“不是贴花，是写错了！”说着还表示很惋惜的神情，嘴里不断地说：“唉！写错了！唉！写错了！”原来是她的妈妈这几天在抄写一份材料，有时写错就用小方纸块贴补改正，当然也表示惋惜。因此，孩子在旁边都观察到了，也就很自然地摹仿着，连一些细微的动作和表情也反映出来。
    两岁半的小兰，对娃娃说：你不听话，你不乖，我把你抱到外面去，不要你了。又说：你不乖，我不给你带糖。这充分地反映了她妈妈对待她的态度。这也反映了妈妈不正确的“威胁”、“利诱”的教育方法，而影响孩子对待人的态度。
    六岁的胜利，是个非常活泼爱动的男孩，他在幼儿园里，爱打人骂人。虽然经过老师不断地教育，仍然没有改正。老师劝告他说：你看我们幼儿园里，谁也不打人骂人，老师也不打人骂人，小朋友们也不打人骂人，好孩子是不打人骂人的，你为什么爱打骂人呢？胜利很肯定地说：我爸爸就爱打人骂人，他还打我妈妈呢！
    由以上几个实例，充分地说明学前儿童是敏锐的观察者。他们能够观察到成人没有注意到的一些细微的事情，并且能够逼真地摹仿出来，连他们不能理解的动作，也在认真地摹仿着。可是，在这般年龄的孩子，辨别是非的能力是很薄弱的，他们只知摹仿，而不知道那些是对的，那些是不对的。因此，孩子们周围的成人，尤其是和孩子们最接近的父母，必须严格地要求自己，注意自己的一言一行，一举一动，为孩子树立榜样，影响孩子的行为。俗话说，近朱者赤，近墨者黑。成人的榜样，对孩子的影响是极为深刻的。
