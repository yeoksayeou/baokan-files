Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 10th: The anti-nuclear weapons testing movement in the United States continues to develop. Sixteen American peace activists are righteously holding a hunger strike in front of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in Germantown, Maryland, to protest the U.S. government's nuclear weapons testing in the Pacific.

This protest was initiated by the U.S. National Committee for Non-Violent Action Against Nuclear Weapons. Initially, ten people participated. By the 9th, the number had increased to sixteen. Some of them began fasting on the 6th.

The demonstrators solemnly rejected the free food offered to them by the Atomic Energy Commission.

At the same time, four American peace activists in Honolulu, who were sentenced to sixty days in prison, stated on the 8th that they would not obey the court's verdict.

Willing, a famous lawyer from California, recently arrived in Tokyo, representing prominent figures from the United States, Britain, Japan, and other countries to collect evidence for accusing the United States of conducting nuclear weapons tests on the high seas. Those who have filed this accusation include American Nobel laureate scientist Pauling and British philosopher Russell, among others.

    美国和平人士绝食
　　抗议在太平洋试验核武器
    新华社10日讯　华盛顿消息：美国的抗议试验核武器运动继续发展。十六个美国和平人士正义凛然地在马里兰州杰曼城美国原子能委员会门前举行绝食，抗议美国政府在太平洋上试验核武器。
    这次抗议是由美国非暴力反对核武器全国委员会发起的。最初有十个人参加。到9日已经增加到十六个人。他们中间有些人从6日就开始绝食了。
    示威者严正拒绝了原子能委员会向他们提供的免费食物。
    和这同时，在檀香山被判六十天徒刑的四个美国和平人士在8日表示他们将不服从法院的判决。
    加利福尼亚州著名律师威林在最近到达东京，代表美国、英国、日本等国家的一些著名人士为控诉美国在公海上进行核武器试验而搜集证据。提出这个控诉的人士中有美国科学家诺贝尔奖金获得者保林和英国哲学家罗素等。
