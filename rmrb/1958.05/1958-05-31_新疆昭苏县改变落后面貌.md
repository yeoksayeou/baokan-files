    Xinjiang Zhaosu County Changes Its Backward Appearance
    Zhaosu County, located in the western part of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has changed the face of a backward mountainous area during this year's spring production. In the past, the county did not have a single mu of irrigated land, but now the entire county has basically achieved irrigation. In the past, not a single tree was planted, but now the county has planted an average of sixty trees per person. Although this spring was hit by eight cold waves and ten snowstorms, no livestock were lost, and the survival rate of young livestock still reached over 96%.
    Zhaosu County is a mountainous county in the western Tianshan Mountains, mainly engaged in animal husbandry. The county has more than 40,000 people of Kazakh, Mongolian, and Uyghur ethnicities. Before liberation, almost all of them were engaged in animal husbandry production. After liberation, more than 200,000 mu of farmland were gradually developed, relying entirely on rainfall for irrigation. Last year, a drought occurred, and the average yield was only 40 jin of grain per mu. Although Zhaosu County has a lot of fertilizer sources (livestock manure), only 4% of the county's cultivated land was fertilized last year. This spring, after four months of hard work, the backward appearance was changed. (Wang Anxin)

    新疆昭苏县改变落后面貌
    新疆维吾尔自治区天山西部的昭苏县，在今年春季生产中，改变了落后山区的面貌。这个县过去没有一亩水地，现在全县已基本实现了水利化；过去从不植一株树，现在全县平均每人已种树六十株；今年春天虽遭遇了八次寒潮和十次暴风雪的侵袭，但牲畜没有损失，幼畜成活率仍达到96％以上。
    昭苏县是天山西部以畜牧业为主的一个山区县份，全县有哈萨克、蒙古、维吾尔等民族四万多人，解放前几乎全部都从事畜牧业生产。解放后陆续开拓了二十多万亩田地，全靠天雨灌溉，去年发生旱灾，平均每亩地只收四十斤粮食。昭苏县虽然肥源（畜粪）很多，但去年全县只有4％的耕地施了肥。今年春天，经过四个月的苦战，就改变了落后面貌。　（王安心）
