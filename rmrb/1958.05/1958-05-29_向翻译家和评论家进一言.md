    A Word to Translators and Critics
    I enjoy reading translated works, especially translations of modern foreign literature. Sometimes I browse in bookstores, and aside from some translations of modern Soviet literature, the rest are mostly translations of foreign classical works. As for translations of excellent modern literature from people's democratic countries and other countries, they are as rare as morning stars. This is definitely a problem in meeting the broad cultural needs of readers.
    Today, when "emphasizing the present and deemphasizing the past" is advocated, I believe that translated works should also be in line with the requirements of the times. Translators should not rush to translate classical literary works, but should first translate works that reflect a strong sense of the times and are related to real life.
    Book review work is becoming increasingly active, but there are not many book reviews of translations, and even some representative translations are published without any reviews or introductions. If one could read a book review beforehand, it would be of great benefit to reading the entire book.
    It is understood that some literary critics only diligently study Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet," Goethe's "The Sorrows of Young Werther," and Balzac's Human Comedy, and disdain to write a few simple book reviews. This is a sign of insufficient concern for readers and "valuing the past and devaluing the present."
    We warmly hope that translators can promptly introduce excellent modern foreign literary works to readers, and also hope that literary critics can write articles that review and introduce translated works quickly and well.

    向翻译家和评论家进一言
    我喜欢读翻译作品，尤其是爱读现代外国文学作品的译本。有时去书店浏览一下，除有一些苏联现代文学作品的译本外，其他都是些外国古典作品的译本，至于人民民主国家和其他各国优秀的现代文学作品的译本，则寥若晨星，这对满足读者广泛的文化要求来说，确是一个问题。
    在提倡“厚今薄古”的今天，我认为翻译作品也应和时代的要求相吻合。翻译家不要急于翻译古典文学作品，而要首先翻译反映出强烈的时代气息和现实生活有关的作品。
    现在书评工作日见活跃，但对于译本的书评还不多，甚至有些代表性的作品的译本出版后，也看不见评介的文章。若事先能读一下书评，对阅读全书是有很多裨益的。
    据了解，有些文学评论家只孜孜不倦地研究莎士比亚的“罗米欧和朱丽叶”、歌德的“少年维特之烦恼”和巴尔扎克的人间喜剧等名著，而不屑于写几篇简单的书评。这是对读者关心不够和“厚古薄今”的表现。
    我们热烈地希望翻译家能及时地把优秀的现代外国文学作品介绍给读者，也希望文学评论家又快、又好地写出评介翻译作品的文章来。
