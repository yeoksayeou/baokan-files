Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 21st: The major construction projects in the Liaoning industrial base have entered a season of large-scale construction this year. Of the ninety-seven above-quota major projects planned for new construction, expansion, and continued construction this year, more than seventy projects have broken with convention and started construction early one after another; the remaining projects have also entered the stage of material allocation and massive construction of auxiliary projects.

The amount of capital construction work in the Liaoning industrial base this year has increased by more than 40% compared to last year, exceeding the peak year of 1956 in the First Five-Year Plan by 20.1%. The construction projects this year, in addition to industrial enterprises such as iron and steel, coal, electricity, petroleum, and chemical industries, also include various small and medium-sized factories and mines. Under the situation of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, various construction departments conscientiously implemented the construction policy of "more, faster, better, and more economical," breaking the outdated rules that restricted the construction progress, so that the start and completion time of many projects were generally advanced by one to two years. The construction time of projects such as the Angang ore dressing plant, which is under accelerated construction, can be shortened by two to six months compared with the original plan. In order to increase the annual coal output from 13 million tons this year to 20 million tons in 1962, the Fushun Mining Bureau is accelerating the overall transformation of the mining area. The huge Huanren Hydropower Station, originally scheduled to be completed in 1961, will also start generating electricity one year ahead of schedule.

In order to accelerate the construction speed, all construction departments have turned the first half of the year into a busy construction season, pushing the construction progress to a peak in April and May. The tasks completed by various major projects in April this year were better than in the same period in previous years. The amount of work completed in the whole month increased by 16.4% compared with March, and by 64.2% compared with the same period last year. The final batch of projects of the Fuxin Xinqiu vertical shaft, which has been under construction for more than three years, adopted the method of accelerating the progress by constructing, inspecting, and handing over simultaneously. The huge Liaoning Power Station has currently completed more than 20,000 cubic meters of earthwork and is expected to complete all the foundation work for the plant buildings by the end of May. At the construction site of the 1,300-meter-long and 138-meter-high dam of the Fushun Dahuofang Reservoir, the builders, with the cooperation of thousands of construction machines, fill more than 20,000 cubic meters of sand and gravel material onto the dam every day. Now the dam has risen to 133 meters and is expected to be completed ahead of schedule in late May.

    打破常例上半年变成忙季
    辽宁近百项大工程紧张施工
    新华社沈阳21日电　辽宁工业基地今年的重大建设工程已经进入大规模施工季节。今年计划新建、扩建和续建的九十七个限额以上的大工程中，目前已有七十多个工程打破常规陆续提早施工；其余工程也已进入材料调配和辅助工程大量施工阶段。
    辽宁工业基地今年的基本建设工作量比去年增加40％多，超过第一个五年计划工作量最高年份1956年20.1％。今年建设的工程项目，除了钢铁、煤炭、电力、石油、化学等工业企业外，还有各种中小型的厂矿。各个建设部门在工农业大跃进的形势下，认真贯彻多快好省的建设方针，打破了限制建设进度的陈规，使许多工程的开工和建成时间普遍提前一两年。正在加速建设的鞍钢选矿等工程，建成的时间可以比原计划缩短两个月到六个月。抚顺矿务局为了使煤的年产量由今年的一千三百万吨提高到1962年的二千万吨，正在加速矿区的总体改造。原订1961年建成的规模巨大的桓仁水电站，也将提前一年开始发电。
    为了加快建设速度，各建设部门都把上半年变为施工忙季，4、5月份就把施工进度推向高峰。各个大工程今年4月份完成任务比历年同时期都好。全月完成的工作量，比3月份增长16.4％，比去年同时期增长64.2％。已经建设了三年多的阜新新丘竖井，最后一批工程采取了边建设、边验收、边移交的方法加快进度。规模巨大的辽宁电站，目前土方工程完成了两万多立方公尺，预计到5月底，厂房基础工程将全部完成。抚顺大伙房水库的一千三百多公尺长、一百三十八公尺高的拦河大坝工地上，建设者们在上千台施工机械配合下，每天把两万多立方公尺的砂土料填筑到大坝上去，现在大坝已升高到一百三十三公尺，预计5月下旬即将提前完工。
