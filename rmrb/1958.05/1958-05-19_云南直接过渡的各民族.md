The ethnic groups in Yunnan transitioning directly to socialism:

    **The Kawa (Va) ethnic group**

    The Kawa ethnic group has a population of 280,000 within Yunnan Province, China. They are one of the most economically backward ethnic groups in the Yunnan border region, having largely preserved remnants of the primitive clan commune system.

    Based on this economic foundation, the Kawa ethnic group retains many primitive and backward customs. The Kawa people do not use livestock for farming, but instead use them solely for "slaughtering cattle to appease ghosts." During the spring plowing season, various tribes go out to collect human heads to sacrifice to the grain, praying for a good harvest, often leading to tribal feuds and skirmishes.

    The Kawa ethnic group has a spoken language but no written script. They use wood carvings and various objects to replace letters in communication, such as using chili peppers and bullets to declare war, and sugarcane to express reconciliation and friendship. They use fingers and toes to calculate numbers, only able to count to ten.

    During the years of reactionary rule, the Kawa people had little interaction with other ethnic groups, and the Kawa Mountains were rumored to be a mysterious and terrifying area. After liberation, the state built highways to the Kawa Mountains and established two Kawa autonomous counties, Ximeng and Cangyuan. The Party and the government sent a large number of cadres to lead the Kawa people in developing production. When Ximeng County was liberated, the average person only had 200 jin of grain; last year, it had increased to 329 jin. Cooperatives have been established on a trial basis, and 48% of Kawa farmers in Cangyuan County have joined cooperatives. Backward customs such as slaughtering cattle to appease ghosts and collecting human heads to sacrifice to the grain have gradually changed and stopped.

    **The Jingpo ethnic group**

    China's Jingpo ethnic group is mainly distributed in the six border counties of the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture in western Yunnan Province, totaling approximately 90,000 people.

    The Jingpo people are a brave and enthusiastic ethnic group. Men carry long knives, hunting guns, or crossbows when they go out, and are fond of hunting. During ethnic festivals, their favorite game is target shooting. Girls hang carefully crafted small cloth bags on the treetops, and a group of young men shoot at them with guns from dozens of steps away. Whoever shoots down the cloth bag has the honor of being invited by the girl to drink wine.

    Before liberation, the Jingpo ethnic group still retained some remnants of clan tribal society in their production methods, such as communal farming, collective house building, and equal distribution of hunting spoils.

    After liberation, in order to lead the Jingpo ethnic group to transition directly to socialist society, a new form of mountain cultural station was created. These cultural stations are established in Jingpo villages with relatively convenient transportation and concentrated populations. They include departments of health, trade, schools, grain, banking, and mass work. They jointly help and promote the Jingpo people to take the road of mutual assistance and cooperation, and gradually form the economic and cultural centers of the Jingpo area. Since the winter of the year before last, twenty-one mountain cultural stations have been established successively. These cultural stations have more than twenty primary schools and nearly two thousand students. The Jingpo people also have their own written script developed with the help of the state. So far, more than 7,000 households in the villages around these cultural stations have formed 488 agricultural cooperatives, with the number of households joining accounting for more than 34% of the total households.

    **The Blang ethnic group**

    The main settlement area of the Blang ethnic group is Bulang Mountain in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, with approximately 30,000 people.

    Living in these remote mountains with dense forests, lush grass, and tigers and leopards for a long time has made the social and economic development of the Blang ethnic group extremely slow. For more than a thousand years, they have been using slash-and-burn farming methods. They only began to use iron hoes to dig the ground twenty years ago. Land is co-owned by the village and privately owned, and relationships such as land sales, pawning, and debt labor have begun to occur, but remnants of clan society are still retained, such as clan members living in the same house and farming the land together.

    The Blang ethnic group universally believes in Buddhism. Every boy must become a monk in a Buddhist temple for a period of time. Buddhism also has a great influence on the production of the Blang ethnic group. Each year, the location for planting mountain land is decided by asking the Buddha to determine it through divination. The Blang ethnic group has its own language, but no written script.

    Due to low production, blocked transportation, and ethnic oppression, the Blang ethnic group lived in extreme poverty before liberation. The average person on Bulang Mountain only had more than 100 jin of grain per year. There was not a single quilt on the entire mountain, and at night the whole family slept by the fire pit to keep warm. After liberation, the state transported hundreds of thousands of jin of grain and tens of thousands of chi of cotton cloth to Bulang Mountain to relieve the poor mountain people, and also gave them a large number of iron farm tools. In 1954, the Mountain People's Government was established in Bulang Mountain, leading the mountain people to develop production and begin to establish Party organizations. The first cooperative was formed in 1956. Last year, the average person on the entire mountain had increased to 380 jin of grain, and the average person in the cooperatives had reached more than 500 jin of grain.

    **The Lahu ethnic group**

    There are approximately 130,000 Lahu people within Yunnan Province today.

    The meaning of "Lahu" is hunting tigers and leopards. It is said that in ancient times, various tribes hunted together, and if they caught a tiger (called "la" in the Lahu language), they would share it together (called "hu" in the Lahu language), hence the name of the ethnic group. Today, the Lahu ethnic group has developed into a stage dominated by agricultural economy, but still maintains the tradition of hunting.

    Except for those near the border, where development is relatively slow and a complete class society has not yet formed, the Lahu ethnic group has basically entered feudal society. Since the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the feudal dynasty appointed eighteen Tusi (local chieftains) and twenty-two Tumu (local headmen) to rule the Lahu people. The Lahu people repeatedly rebelled against them and were called "the land of constant rebellion." It was not until 1948, when the Communist Party's underground organization led the Lahu people to fight against the reactionary government, that a new situation emerged.

    On April 1, 1953, according to the Party's policy of ethnic regional autonomy, the Lancang Lahu Autonomous County was established. The state provides nearly 100,000 yuan in loans and relief funds each year to help the autonomous county develop production. The average person in the county only had 100 to 200 jin of grain per year before liberation, but last year it reached 477 jin.

    In order to clear the obstacles on the road to socialism, the autonomous county abolished the feudal land ownership system in a peaceful and consultative manner from 1955 to 1956 in an area with a population of over 160,000. In an area with a more backward economy near the border with a population of over 60,000, it was decided to transition directly to socialism through the development of production, mutual assistance, and cooperation. Currently, 230 agricultural production cooperatives and more than 2,400 mutual aid groups have been established in both areas, and the organized farmers account for 85% of the total farmers in the county.

    **The Nu ethnic group**

    The Nu ethnic group is an indigenous ethnic group in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture. The population is only over 12,000 people. The year before last, the Nu and Dulong ethnic groups jointly established the Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County.

    At the time of liberation, the iron hoe used by the Nu ethnic group was only the size of a palm, like a child's toy.

    Nu villages are composed of one or several clans, each with its own territory. Each clan has its own headman, who has no special privileges. The economic cell of the Nu ethnic group is the individual family, and the cultivated land is basically privately owned. However, a distorted form of "communal farming" is still retained: several families contribute land, seeds, and labor, and then divide the harvest equally. According to surveys, communal land accounts for 30% of the total cultivated land, and communal households account for 50% to 70% of the total number of households.

    The Nu ethnic group loves drinking, dancing, and singing. Throughout the year, day and night, one can always hear the songs of men, women, the old, and the young.

    After liberation, the state allocates 30,000 to 40,000 yuan each year to freely distribute iron farm tools and other production and living materials. As a result, the production and living standards of the Nu ethnic group have rapidly improved. Last year, the average person had 450 jin of grain, more than double that before liberation. Now, the Nu ethnic group has achieved semi-socialist agricultural cooperation, and many customs that hinder production are changing.

    **The Dulong ethnic group**

    By the time of liberation, only 2,500 Dulong people remained. They are one of the smallest ethnic minorities in China.

    Before liberation, the main production tools of most of the Dulong residents were wooden hoes, bamboo sticks, and stone tools, with very few iron farm tools. Dulong villages are composed of several patrilineal families or clans, and each family constitutes a production and consumption cell. They live together for generations in a string of long houses. The head of the family is the male with the highest seniority and the oldest age. The land is owned collectively by the village, clan, or family, cultivated jointly, and distributed equally.

    The Dulong people are good at using bone needles to sew intricate bamboo and rattan articles and fishing nets. Women are even more skilled at weaving linen clothes and making ornaments from various shells and bones. Women also have the custom of tattooing their faces, and after the age of twelve, they tattoo blue butterfly-shaped and geometric patterns on their faces.

    The Dulong ethnic group worships nature gods. Their biggest festival is the "jumping on the cow pile." During this period, they slaughter cattle for sacrifice, drink, and celebrate wildly with singing and dancing for several days.

    In 1950, the Dulong people were reborn. The People's Government abolished harsh levies and burdens and distributed a large amount of rations, cotton clothing, salt, and iron farm tools. The situation where more than 90% of the people lacked food before liberation has rapidly changed. Now, every family has iron farm tools, and everyone wears cotton clothes. The Dulong people, who practiced slash-and-burn farming, have learned to use hoes and plows. More than 400 mu of paddy fields have appeared on the banks of the Dulong River for the first time.

    The year before last, the Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County was established in the Nujiang Lisu Autonomous Prefecture.

    **The Benglong ethnic group**

    The Benglong people are ancient residents of the Gaoligong Mountains. There are only more than 4,000 Benglong people in the entire province. Most are small villages of a few to a dozen households, interspersed among other ethnic groups in the mountains.

    The Benglong people are good at managing mountain land and vegetable gardens, and even more skilled at cultivating tea gardens.

    The Benglong people do not marry outside their ethnic group. Marriage within the ethnic group is free, and as long as the young men and women are willing, the parents do not disagree.

    Like the Dai ethnic group, the Benglong people believe in Buddhism. They also celebrate the Water-Sprinkling Festival.

    Now, the threat of so-called "miasma" and other epidemic diseases that once shrouded the Benglong people has been lifted. Agricultural cooperatives composed of Benglong people have been established on a trial basis around the mountain cultural stations in Luxi, Ruili, and other counties in the Dehong area.

    云南直接过渡的各民族
    佧佤族
    佧佤族在我国云南省境内共有二十八万人，是云南边疆社会经济最落后、较完整地保存着原始氏族公社残余的民族之一。
    在这样的经济基础上，佧佤族流行着许多原始落后的风俗习惯。佧佤族的牲畜不用于耕作，专门供作“剽牛祭鬼”。在春耕时各部落要出去砍人头来祭谷，祈祷丰收，往往因此引起部落间的仇杀械斗。
    佧佤族有语言而无文字，交往中用木刻和各种实物代替书信，如用辣椒、子弹表示宣战，用甘蔗表示和解友好，计算数字时用手指脚趾加减，只能算到十位。
    在反动统治的年月，佧佤人与其他民族交往很少，佧佤山被传闻为一个神秘恐怖的地区。解放后，国家修筑了通往佧佤山的公路，建立了西盟和沧源两个佧佤族自治县。党和政府派了大批干部去领导佧佤人发展生产。西盟县解放时平均每人只有粮食二百斤，去年已增加为三百二十九斤。并试办了合作社，沧源县已有48％的佧佤农户加入了合作社。剽牛祭鬼和砍人头祭谷的落后习俗已逐步改变和停止。
    景颇族
    我国的景颇族主要分布在云南省西部德宏傣族景颇族自治州的边沿六县，共约九万人。
    景颇族是个慓悍、热情的民族。男子外出，必配带长刀、猎枪或弩弓，酷嗜狩猎。每逢欢度民族节日，人们最热爱的游戏是打靶。由姑娘把精心制成的小布包挂在树梢上，让一群小伙子在几十步外用枪射击，谁将布包击落，谁就得到姑娘请喝酒的光荣。
    景颇族在解放前，在生产方式上还保留一些氏族部落社会的残余，如共耕、集体建屋、平均分配猎获物等。
    解放后，为了领导景颇族直接过渡到社会主义社会，创造了山区文化站的新形式。这种文化站建立在交通比较方便、人口较为集中的景颇族居住的村寨里。包括卫生、贸易、学校、粮食、银行、群众工作等部门。他们共同帮助和促进景颇族走互助合作的道路，并逐步形成景颇族地区的经济、文化的中心。从前年冬天起，先后建立了二十一个山区文化站。这些文化站上已有二十多所小学和近两千学生，景颇族还有国家帮助制定的本民族文字。到目前止，这些文化站周围村寨的各族人民，已有七千多户组成四百八十八个农业社，入社农户已占总农户的34％以上。
    布朗族
    布朗族主要聚居区是西双版纳傣族自治州的布朗山，约有三万人。
    长期生活在这座林深草茂、虎豹出没、与世隔绝的深山里，使布朗族的社会经济发展极为缓慢，一千多年来一直使用刀耕火种的方法生产，二十年前才开始用铁锄挖地。土地系村寨公有制与私有制并存，已开始发生土地买卖、典当及债利雇工等关系，但还保留着氏族社会的残余，如氏族成员同住一房、伙种土地等。
    布朗族普遍信奉佛教，每个男孩都要到佛寺当一段时期的和尚。佛教对布朗族生产的影响也很大，每年到何处种山地，要请佛爷卜卦决定。布朗族有自己的语言，但无文字。
    由于生产低下、交通闭塞和民族压迫等原因，布朗族在解放前的生活极为贫困。布朗山平均每人每年只有一百余斤粮食，全山没有一床被子，夜里全家睡在火塘边烤火度夜。解放后，国家运了几十万斤粮食和几万尺棉布到布朗山救济贫苦山民，还送给他们大量的铁质农具。1954年，在布朗山成立了山区人民政府，领导山民发展生产并开始建立党的组织，1956年组成了第一个合作社。去年，全山每人平均粮食已增加到三百八十斤，合作社每人平均粮食已达五百多斤。
    拉祜族
    拉祜族现在云南省境内的约有十三万人。
    “拉祜”两字的意思是猎食虎豹。据说在远古的时候，各部落共同狩猎，捕获猛虎（拉祜语称为拉），就大家一起分食（拉祜语称为祜），因以为族名。今天，拉祜族已发展到以农业经济为主的阶段，还是保持着打猎的传统。
    拉祜族除靠近国境边缘的发展比较缓慢，尚未形成完整的阶级社会以外，基本上已进入封建社会。自从明末清初，封建王朝册封了十八个土司和二十二个土目来统治拉祜人民以后，拉祜人曾累次起义反抗，被称为“久反之地”。直到1948年，共产党地下组织领导拉祜族人民向反动政府斗争，才出现了新的局面。
    1953年4月1日，拉祜族根据党的民族区域自治政策，成立了澜沧拉祜族自治县。国家每年发放将近十万元的贷款和救济款帮助自治县发展生产。全县解放前平均每年每人只有一百斤至二百斤粮食，去年已达到四百七十七斤。
    为了扫清向社会主义前进途中的障碍，自治县1955年至1956年在十六万多人口的地区采用和平协商方式废除了封建土地所有制。在靠近国境边缘经济更为落后的六万多人口地区，确定通过发展生产、互助合作的道路直接过渡到社会主义。现在，两种地区共建立了二百三十个农业生产合作社和二千四百多个互助组，组织起来的农户已占全县总农户的85％。
    怒族
    怒族是怒江傈僳族自治州的土著民族。人口只有一万二千多人。前年，怒族和独龙族一道，联合成立了贡山独龙族怒族自治县。
    解放时，怒族使用的铁锄还只有巴掌般大，仿佛小孩的玩具一般。
    怒族村寨由一个或几个氏族组成，各有自己的地界。各氏族都有自己的头人，他们没有特权。怒族的经济细胞已是个体家庭，已耕土地基本私有。但还保留着变态的“共耕”方式：几家人互出土地、籽种和劳力，共耕之后平均分配。据调查，共耕地占总耕地的30％，共耕户占总户数的50％到70％。
    怒族喜爱饮酒、跳舞和唱歌。一年到头，日日夜夜，随时都可以听到男的女的老的少的歌声。
    解放后，每年国家都要拨三、四万元，无偿发放铁质农具和其他生产、生活资料。因此，怒族的生产和生活水平迅速改观。去年平均每人已有粮食四百五十斤，比解放前增加一倍以上。现在，怒族已实现农业半社会主义合作化，许多妨碍生产的习俗正在改变着。
    独龙族
    独龙族到解放时，只剩有二千五百人。是我国人口最少的少数民族之一。
    解放前，独龙族的大多数居民的主要生产工具是木锄、竹棍和石器，极少铁质农具。独龙族村寨是由几个父系家族或宗族组成，每个家族构成生产和消费的细胞。他们几代同居，住在一串长长的房子里。家族的首脑是辈份最高、年岁最大的男子。土地为村寨、氏族或家族共有，共同耕作，平均分配。
    独龙人善用骨针缝制很精巧的竹篾器和渔网。妇女更擅长编制麻布衣和用各种贝类和骨类制成装饰品。女子还有纹面的习俗，在十二岁以后，便在面上刺青色的蝶状和几何形花纹。
    独龙族崇拜自然神。他们最大的节日是跳牛锅桩。在这期间要剽牛祭祀，饮酒狂欢，歌舞数日。
    1950年，独龙人得到新生，人民政府取消苛派负担，并大量发放了口粮、棉衣、盐巴和铁质农具。解放前那种90％以上的人缺口粮的情况迅速改变。现在，家家有了铁质农具，人人穿上棉衣。刀耕火种的独龙人学会用锄头和犁头了。独龙河畔第一次出现四百多亩水田。
    前年，怒江傈僳族自治州贡山县建立了独龙族怒族自治县。
    崩龙族
    崩龙人是高黎贡山上古老的居民。全省的崩龙人只有四千多名。多系几户到十来户的小村寨，杂居在山区其他民族中间。
    崩龙人善于经营山地和菜园，更擅长培育茶园。
    崩龙人不和外族通婚。在本民族内婚姻是自由的，只要男女青年双方愿意，父母没有不答应的。
    崩龙人和傣族一样，信奉佛教。他们也度泼水节。
    现在，曾笼罩在崩龙人头上的所谓“瘴气”等流行性疾病的威胁，已经解除。在德宏地区潞西、瑞丽等县的山区文化站周围，都已试办了崩龙人组成的农业社。（本栏照片除署名者外均为本报记者王传国、黄昌禄摄）
