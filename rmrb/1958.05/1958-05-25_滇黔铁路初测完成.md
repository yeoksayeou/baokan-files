Construction Blossoms

    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 24th May. The preliminary survey of the Dian-Qian Railway has been completed.

    This railway will run from Guiyang through Anshun and Shuicheng County to Rongfeng County in Yunnan Province. After connecting with the Nei-Kun Railway, it will extend to Kunming. The entire length is 420 kilometers. After connecting with the Xiang-Qian Railway, which is about to be constructed, and the Zhe-Gan Railway, which is already open to traffic, it will form China's second major east-west railway trunk line parallel to the Longhai Railway, connecting Shanghai and Kunming in the southwestern border region.

    The Dian-Qian Railway traverses an area rich in mineral resources, including large coalfields, iron ore, and non-ferrous metals. The construction of this railway is of great significance for the development of the resources in these areas.

    Since March of this year, the staff of the Fourth, Second, and First Survey Teams of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways, who were surveying this line, have repeatedly brought forward the survey plan under the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture. In the survey, the staff promoted advanced working methods such as surveying as the main method, drilling as the auxiliary method, and Liu Peifeng's rapid leveling method, which changed the situation where geological drilling could not keep up with the route selection, increasing the survey progress from six kilometers per day to twenty-two kilometers.

    滇黔铁路初测完成
    新华社贵阳24日电　滇黔铁路初测完成。
    这条铁路将由贵阳经安顺、水城县至云南省的榕峰县，和内昆铁路接轨后通向昆明，全长四百二十公里。它和即将施工的湘黔铁路、已通车的浙赣铁路衔接起来后，就组成了和陇海铁路平行的我国第二条东西铁路大干线，使上海和西南边陲的昆明连接在一起。
    滇黔铁路沿线矿产十分丰富，有大煤田、铁矿和有色金属等矿产。铁路修通后，对开发这些地区的资源有很大意义。
    从今年3月份起，勘测这条线路的铁道部第二设计院第四、二、一勘测总队的职工，在工农业大跃进的鼓舞下，勘测计划一再提前。职工们在勘测中推广了以测绘为主、钻探为辅和柳培凤快速抄平法等先进工作方法，改变了地质钻探跟不上选线的状况，使勘测进度由每天六公里提高到二十二公里。（附图片）
