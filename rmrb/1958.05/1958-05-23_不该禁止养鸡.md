    Should Not Prohibit Raising Chickens

    Recently, I traveled to Taixing, Taixing, and Jingjiang counties in Jiangsu and found that the rural areas in this area generally prohibit raising chickens. The main reason is that people are afraid that chickens will damage crops. Yangzhou City also prohibits raising chickens in the city in order to promote the Patriotic Health Campaign. Therefore, in the large and small market towns in these rural areas, chickens for sale can be seen everywhere, and fresh chicken prices are as low as four jiao per jin. I believe that raising chickens is a sideline production with a historical habit in rural areas. At the same time, raising chickens meets the needs of urban people for meat and egg consumption, and can also be exported in exchange for industrial raw materials, chemical fertilizers, etc. Therefore, raising chickens is actually beneficial and harmless, especially in mountain and forest areas, where raising chickens should be vigorously promoted; in plain areas, we should use the front and back of houses, bamboo forests, and empty courtyards to raise chickens to accumulate fertilizer, find pests, and increase income. What's wrong with that? Of course, if each household raises a lot of them and the management is improper, they may sometimes damage crops. However, as long as the management is good, for example, if the housing conditions are good, they can be raised in enclosures, or the old, weak, and disabled labor force can be used to raise them full-time, which will not have any impact on the crops. Therefore, I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in various places should study and solve the feeding and management methods of raising chickens, and should not completely prohibit raising chickens.

### 不该禁止养鸡

    不该禁止养鸡
    最近我有事到江苏泰县、泰兴、靖江等县，发现这一带农村普遍在禁止养鸡。主要是怕鸡糟踏庄稼，扬州市为了搞好爱国卫生运动，城内亦禁止养鸡。因此，在这些地区农村的大小集镇上，到处可以看到卖鸡的，鲜鸡价格便宜到四角多钱一斤。我认为养鸡是农村有历史习惯的副业生产。同时养鸡供应城市人民肉食、蛋品消费的需要，还可以出口，换回工业原料、化学肥料等。所以，养鸡实际上有益无害，特别是在山林地区，应大力号召养鸡；平原地区应利用家前屋后、竹林空院等，养鸡积肥，觅食害虫，增加收入，有什么不好呢？当然每户社员都养得很多，并且管理不当，有时会糟踏庄稼的。但是，只要管理得好，比如住宅条件好的采取围养，亦可利用老弱残废劳力专人放养，对庄稼是不会有什么影响的。因此，我建议各地农业社应研究解决养鸡的饲养管理方法，不应完全禁止养鸡。
