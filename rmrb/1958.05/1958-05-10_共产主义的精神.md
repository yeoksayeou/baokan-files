    The Spirit of Communism
    Wu Chunyi, Jianming Commune, Zunhua County, Hebei
    At dusk, a bicycle team of forty or so bikes came to our commune. Behind the bikes were bedrolls, and some even had two iron buckets strapped to the sides, with carrying poles tied to the bike frames. Following them was a walking team, everyone carrying luggage and two iron buckets, some even carrying picks. What kind of team was this?
    It turned out that our area had not had a thorough rain since September of last year. The county party committee called on us to "guarantee sowing without rain in one season, and guarantee a bumper harvest without rain in one year." This requires us to not only make every effort to fight drought and sow seeds, but also to vigorously carry out water conservancy projects. With more than twice the usual number of people working, we felt that the labor force was too small. At this tense and difficult moment, the peasant brothers in the plains came to support us. They brought their own tools and grain, and enthusiastically helped us fight the drought and sow seeds. More than 250 people came to our commune alone.
    How touching is this spirit of communism! But not long ago, I still heard such comments: Intellectuals go to the countryside for labor training, firstly to improve their physical fitness; and secondly to learn some practical farming knowledge from the peasants, and that's all. As for ideological consciousness and quality, there is nothing to learn, because it is said that the peasants are mostly conservative, backward, and selfish.
    I think it is time for these people to open their eyes and look at the facts. Can't the magnificent communist actions of the peasant brothers educate them even a little?

    共产主义的精神
    河北遵化县建明社　吴纯一
    黄昏的时候，我们社里来了一行四十来辆的自行车队，车后都带着行李卷儿，有的在两边还挎着两只铁水桶，车杠上绑着扁担。随后，步行的大队来了，每人都背着行李、挑着两只铁水桶，有的还扛着镐。这是什么队伍？
    原来，我们这个地区，从去年9月到现在没有落过一场透雨，县委号召：“一季无雨，保证播种；一年无雨，保证丰产。”这就要一方面全力抗旱播种，一方面大力修水利。比往年多用一倍以上的人，深感劳动力太少。在这紧张、困难的时刻，平原地区的农民兄弟来支援我们了。他们自己带着工具，带着粮食，热情地帮助我们抗旱播种，只我们社就来了二百五十多人。
    这种共产主义的精神多么感动人啊！可是就在前不久，我还听到这样的议论：知识分子下乡劳动锻炼，一是增强体质；二是向农民学点实际的耕作知识，如此而已。至于思想意识和品质，那没什么可学的，因为据说农民大都是保守、落后、自私的。
    我想，现在该是这些人睁开眼睛看看事实的时候了，难道农民弟兄们的这种豪壮的共产主义的举动，还不能使他们受到一点教育吗？
