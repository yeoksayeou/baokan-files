    Sowing Flyers
    (Five Street Poems)
    Tian Jian
    Dedicated to the Zhuge Liang Conference
    A few days ago, Huailai held a drought resistance and sowing oath-taking conference. At the meeting, township and commune cadres put forward many specific measures and guaranteed to resolutely implement the calls of the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee: "If it doesn't rain in spring, ensure the survival of all seedlings; if it doesn't rain all year, ensure a bumper harvest."
    This was an oath-taking conference and also a Zhuge Liang conference. In various tasks, holding more "Zhuge Liang conferences" in counties, townships, and communes is very meaningful. Therefore, I wrote the following street poems.
    A thousand people offer ideas,
    Basins and pots become ponds.
    Men and women go to war together,
    Spring water becomes the ocean.
    Today's Zhuge Liang,
    Wants to fight with the heavens!

    Digging Spring Rumor
    A spring by the mountain,
    Doesn't flow water all year round.
    A Guanyin temple,
    Is pressing on this spring.
    Move away the Guanyin temple,
    Spring water flows to the sky.
    [Postscript] Cadres of the Shuitou Village Commune in Waijinggou Township expressed such determination at the county meeting, to dig out spring water from under the Guanyin temple.

    Water Diversion Order
    We are the new Pangu,
    Want to hoe clouds and plow mist;
    Want to build bridges for water,
    Want to make roads for water;
    Want to call river water up the mountains,
    Ensure a bumper harvest even if it doesn't rain all year.

    Brother Communes
    West Yulin, South Shuiquan,
    We are brother communes.
    Trees connected to trees, ditches connected to ditches,
    Mountains connected to mountains, water connected to water,
    To defeat the old Heaven,
    Water use should not be divided by boundaries.
    A thousand trees, a garden,
    When they bloom, it's a vast expanse.

    Sowing Quantity
    Drums and gongs are loud at the village entrance,
    Basins and pots water the fields.
    Sweat is like raindrops,
    Determination is like thunder.

    播种传单
    （街头诗五首）
    田间
    献给诸葛亮会
    前几天，怀来召开一次抗旱播种誓师大会。会上，乡和社的干部提出很多具体措施，并保证坚决实现省委、地委的号召：“春不下雨保全苗，年不下雨保丰收。”
    这是一次誓师大会，也是一次诸葛亮会。在各项工作中，在县和乡、社，多召开“诸葛亮会”，是很有意义的事情。因此，我写了下面这几首街头诗。
    千人出主张，
    盆罐当池塘。
    男女齐出征，
    泉水变海洋。
    今日诸葛亮，
    要和天打仗！
    挖泉谣
    山边一条泉，
    长年不出水。
    一座观音庙，
    压着这条泉。
    搬掉观音庙，
    泉水流上天。
    〔附记〕外井沟乡水头村社干部，在县的会议上表示这样的决心，要从观音庙下面挖出泉水。
    引水令
    我们是新盘古，
    要锄云要犁雾；
    要给水来架桥，
    要给水来造路；
    要叫河水上山头，
    年不下雨保丰收。
    兄弟社
    西榆林，南水泉，
    我们是兄弟社。
    树连树，沟连沟，
    山连山，水连水，
    要战胜老天爷，
    用水要不分界线。
    千棵树一座花园，
    开了花是一大片。
    播种量
    村头锣鼓喧天，
    地里盆罐点水。
    汗水好似雨点，
    决心好似劈雷。
