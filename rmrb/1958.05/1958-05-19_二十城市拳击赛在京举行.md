　　Twenty Cities Boxing Tournament Held in Beijing

　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th—The 1958 National Twenty Cities Boxing Championship began this afternoon at the Beijing Gymnasium. This is the largest boxing competition in our country's history in terms of scale and number of participants.

　　What distinguishes this competition from previous years is that athletes are participating in all ten weight classes, from the junior flyweight to the heavyweight. Furthermore, among the 142 boxers from various regions, more than two-thirds are novices or athletes participating in a national competition for the first time.

　　This championship uses an elimination system, with each match consisting of three rounds, each lasting two minutes. Judging from today's matches, the athletes have made significant progress in technique and physical strength compared to last year. The athletes have mastered offensive and evasive techniques to varying degrees, and there are few cases of reckless brawling, as seen in past competitions. Situations of overwhelming dominance are also rare. After six minutes of intense fighting, they still appear quite relaxed.

　　Today, the first round of partial matches in six weight classes was held, and the entire competition is scheduled to end on the 25th.

　　二十城市拳击赛在京举行
    据新华社18日讯　1958年全国二十个城市拳击锦标赛今天下午在北京体育馆开始举行。这是我国历年来规模最大参加人数最多的一次拳击比赛。
    这次比赛和往年不同的是：从次最轻量级到最重量级的十个级别中，都有运动员参加。并且在来自各地的一百四十二名拳击选手中，有三分之二以上都是新手或者是第一次参加全国性比赛的运动员。
    这次锦标赛是用淘汰制进行，每场比赛分三个回合，每个回合进行两分钟。从今天比赛看来，运动员们在技术和体力上比去年有显著进步。运动员们都不同程度地掌握了进攻和躲闪的技术，很少有像过去比赛中发生的蛮干现象。双方实力悬殊很大、一面倒的局面也很少出现。他们在经过六分钟的激烈决斗以后，仍然显得十分轻松。
    今天共举行了六个等级的第一轮的部分比赛，全部比赛预定在25日结束。
