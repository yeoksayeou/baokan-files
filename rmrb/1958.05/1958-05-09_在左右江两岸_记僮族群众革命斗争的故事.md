    On the Banks of the Left and Right Rivers
    A Story of the Revolutionary Struggle of the Zhuang People
    By Our Correspondents Guan Junfang and Huang Yijie
    On the eve of the establishment of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, our correspondents visited the old revolutionary base areas of the Right River and Left River.
    From the First Revolutionary Civil War until the liberation of Guangxi in 1949, the people of the Zhuang, Han, Yao, and other ethnic groups in the Right River and Left River areas, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, carried out heroic revolutionary struggles, advancing wave upon wave for over twenty years. The people of all ethnic groups wrote a great and moving revolutionary epic with their blood.
    We visited the areas around Donglan and Bama Yao Autonomous Counties in the old revolutionary base area of the Right River. Here, stone mountains are connected one after another, clear rivers flow through the valleys, and villages with lush forests are scattered on both banks. In Donglan, surrounded by verdant hills, we paid our respects at the Revolutionary Martyrs' Cemetery, where the remains of the Red Seventh Army's Twenty-first Division Commander, Martyr Wei Baqun, are buried. In Zhonghe Township, we visited Kuixing Tower, where the leaders of the Red Seventh Army had held many meetings in the past. In early 1930, Comrade Deng Xiaoping lived in Kuixing Tower. In Zhonghe Township, we also visited Lenin Rock, where Martyr Wei Baqun held the first session of the Peasant Movement Training Institute in 1925.
    We visited Nalie Township, the hometown of the outstanding son of the Zhuang people, Communist Party member, Martyr Wei Baqun. The villages here have been completely renewed, and the ruins and broken walls left after the looting by the White bandit army are no longer visible. Except for the elderly and children, there is no idle person in the village. Farmers of all ethnic groups are working on water conservancy projects and in the fields. Many old revolutionaries and old soldiers of the Red Seventh Army have maintained the glorious revolutionary traditions of the past. Although they are old, they are still at the forefront of production. Huang Chunlan, the fifty-year-old female township head of Nalie Township, is an old soldier of the Red Seventh Army. Because of her long-term combat life of climbing mountains, wading through rivers, sleeping in caves, and eating wild vegetables, her body is now very weak. However, in addition to office work, she still goes to the fields or water conservancy construction sites to participate in labor every day. Her husband, the revolutionary elder Wei Zhongji, is a county-level model for special care and a water conservancy model. Huang Yingzhou, the accountant of the collective farming society personally guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, political commissar of the Red Seventh Army, in 1929, is now over sixty years old. He takes care of the cattle herd in the agricultural cooperative, raising the cattle fat and strong.
    The Zhuang, Han, and Yao farmers here told many heroic stories of Martyr Wei Baqun.
    Once, Wei Baqun and four comrades were surrounded on a stone mountain by more than 300 Kuomintang bandit soldiers. After a fierce battle, four comrades sacrificed one after another. Just as the situation was extremely dangerous, Wei Baqun discovered a small snake crawling beside his feet. He covered the snake with his straw hat and hid himself under a stone slab. After the enemy troops climbed the mountain, they searched everywhere but could not find Wei Baqun. When they picked up the straw hat and discovered a snake underneath, one of the soldiers exclaimed in surprise, "The bandit leader has turned into a snake!" The enemy troops surrounded the straw hat and the snake. An officer scolded the soldiers and continued to search the mountain. After searching for a long time but still unable to find Wei Baqun, they had no choice but to take the straw hat and the snake to claim credit. At that time, the White bandit army widely publicized in Donglan city that Wei Baqun had been captured and that Wei Baqun was a monster transformed from a snake, in order to undermine the people's revolutionary will.
    On another occasion, Wei Baqun was being chased by the enemy. He quickly ran over a mountain ridge and arrived at a small river. A farmer was fishing by the river. Seeing that Brother Wei Ba was being chased by the White bandits, he exchanged his jacket with Wei Baqun and wore Wei Baqun's straw hat, wading to the opposite bank and running down a path. Wei Baqun sat by the river fishing. The enemy troops arrived at the river and shouted at the fisherman, "Did you see a bandit wearing a straw hat run past?" The fisherman did not speak, but simply pointed to the opposite bank, and the White bandit army indeed saw a person wearing a straw hat running, so they waded across the river to chase after him.
    The counter-encirclement guerrilla warfare scored one victory after another. By early 1929, the enemy was driven out of the revolutionary base areas of Donglan, Fengshan, and other counties in a state of panic. In the autumn of that year, Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Zhang Yunyi led the uprising troops to Tiandong, Tianyang, Baise, and other places, where they joined forces with the peasant troops originally led by Wei Baqun. Soon, the Right River Soviet Government was formally established, and the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army's Seventh Army was formed.
    In 1930, after the Red Seventh Army joined forces with the Red Eighth Army established in the Left River area, it was ordered to march north to the Central Soviet Area in Jiangxi. Before departure, the various columns of the Red Seventh Army were reorganized into three divisions. Wei Baqun served as the commander of the Twenty-first Division, leading a part of the troops to remain in the Right River area to persist in armed struggle.
    After the Red Seventh Army marched north, the Bai Chongxi bandits gathered more than 10,000 troops and launched a frenzied and cruel "mopping-up" operation against the Donglan revolutionary base area. The Red Army had dealt the bandit army a head-on blow, but due to the disparity in strength between the enemy and ourselves, it retreated to the old base area in Xishan. The bandit army occupied most of the Soviet area, burning, killing, and looting everywhere. In Fengshan Baile Township alone, seven out of eight villages were burned down, and more than 280 people were killed in Haiting Township one morning. The Right River Revolution entered a difficult period again. Wei Baqun led the Red Army guerrillas and the people of all ethnic groups in a hard struggle against the evil enemy for more than two years, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. In 1932, due to betrayal by a traitor, Martyr Wei Baqun heroically sacrificed his precious life for the great revolutionary cause of the Party and the people on October 20.
    However, the flames of revolutionary struggle in the Right River area continued to burn fiercely. Under the leadership of the Party, the Red Army guerrillas and the people of all ethnic groups continued to hold high the banner of revolution and advance.
    Many people in the old revolutionary base areas of Donglan and Fengshan still remember a Zhuang folk song that was popular in those years:
    We are poor farmers,
    The scorching sun burns like fire, and the plow never stops;
    We eat sour porridge and a little bit of pickles,
    Our clothes and pants can hardly cover our bodies.
    The White bandits and local tyrants want to devour our brains;
    Thanks to the Communist Party,
    Leading the revolution,
    Commander Zhang, Brother Wei Ba, organizing us,
    Launching the red and white struggle;
    The Soviet is established, and all ethnic groups are equal;
    Overthrowing the local tyrants and dividing the land,
    Everyone can stand up.
    The White bandits counterattack, wanting to kill us all;
    We unite closely, like brothers in life and death;
    We are not afraid of losing our heads,
    We are not afraid of shedding blood,
    We swear to fight the White bandits to the end.
    In this area, there are many heroes who persisted from the Second Revolutionary Civil War to liberation. We visited the "Three Guis of Xishan" in Bama Yao Autonomous County. The Three Guis are Zhuang Communist Party members Huang Liangui, Huang Zhugui, two brothers and their cousin Huang Bagui.
    In 1929, the three Huang Liangui brothers joined the revolution. During the cruel "encirclement and suppression" by the White bandit army in 1932, the three brothers hid on a mountain. To avoid being discovered by the enemy, they moved around the mountain, sleeping under trees and next to rocks. They ate half a meal of pumpkin and sweet potatoes every day to fill their stomachs. Later, they could not even eat pumpkins and sweet potatoes, and even "revolutionary vegetables" (wild vegetables) were eaten up, so they had to fill their stomachs with tender grass. During these difficult days, some people went down the mountain to surrender, and everyone said that the revolution had failed. But they did not believe that the revolution would fail. They worked odd jobs to make a living and searched for revolutionary organizations everywhere. In the winter of 1933, they finally found the organization. The task given to them by the higher authorities was to mobilize the support of young and old people for the revolution through the youth. In less than a year after the three brothers returned to their hometown, Nongzhu Village became one of the main revolutionary strongholds in Xishan. Many revolutionary leading comrades repeatedly hid and carried out revolutionary activities here.
    Not long after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, Huang Guinan, then secretary of the Right River Party Committee, defected to the enemy, and the entire Xishan underground Party organization and the list of Party members were exposed. The leading comrades active in Nongzhu Village were transferred to other places to hide, and the Liangui brothers went up the mountain again. The enemy sent a large number of plainclothes agents to search for and assassinate Party members and revolutionary cadres. The enemy also repeatedly sent people to lure the Liangui brothers to surrender. Some relatives and friends also believed that the revolution had failed and advised them to surrender, but they were all rejected. They planted a little swidden land, worked odd jobs for people, and continued to do the Party's transportation work. However, due to continuous floods, there was no harvest in the fields, and they could only eat corn for three months each year, spending the rest of the days eating pumpkins and wild vegetables. After 1940, the Liangui brothers took up arms again and participated in the guerrilla war. The famous 1947 "Wangang Uprising" saw the Red Army guerrillas liberate Wangang (now Bama Yao Autonomous County) and Fengshan County. The Liangui brothers were in the ranks of the fighting.
    Now Liangui is the secretary of the Party branch of the Communist Party in the township. Bagui and Zhugui are members of the agricultural cooperative. Years of hard life have filled their dark and thin faces with large wrinkles. They speak with vigor and emit hearty laughter from time to time.
    After liberation, the three brothers returned to Bali Liao Township to rebuild their homes. Liangui and Zhugui both got married and started families.
    During the arduous struggle of the Red Army and guerrillas in the Right River Soviet area, many heroic and tragic deeds occurred. Here is an account of a moving deed.
    In September 1932, the White bandit army launched an "encirclement and suppression" campaign against the Soviet area. The Soviet area was divided into many small pieces, and the small number of Red Army troops could only operate in the dangerous mountainous areas. Ganmengdong in Tian'e County was a small valley on the highest peak of the stone mountain area in this area, inhabited by three Zhuang families, surrounded by cliffs and steep mountain slopes, with only two small paths passable in the southeast and northwest directions. More than 80 people from the Red Army Qian-Gui Border Independent Battalion were forced to retreat here at that time, surrounded on all sides by the White bandit army and the local landlord armed militia. The Red Army held out for three days and three nights. On the fourth morning, a thick fog filled the air, and the enemy's artillery fire rained down, turning the verdant hills into scorched earth. Many soldiers sacrificed. The enemy launched multiple charges like mad dogs. The Red Army soldiers ran out of bullets, so they used stones to fight. The enemy could not charge up the mountain. At this moment, more than ten militiamen took advantage of the smoke to climb up from the cliff, breaking through the gap on the northwest side. After the soldiers ran out of stones, they swung their gun butts to fight the enemy in close combat. The enemy climbed to the top of the mountain in a dark mass. Zhuang soldier Luo Jiahong used a pair of small broadswords to kill several enemies, then hugged two enemies and jumped off the cliff together. In the end, only seven Red Army soldiers were left. Each of them hugged an enemy or grabbed two enemies and rolled down the cliff together. These seven Zhuang warriors were: Huang Wenming, Li Kui, Huang Dedong, Wei Mingfu, Yan Laosan, Lin Yingqiao, and a female hero, Lan Caie.
    We also visited the Left River area. The Left River area has a long revolutionary history and tradition. In 1930, the activities of the Red Seventh and Eighth Armies spread throughout the area. Soviet power was established in counties such as Longjin, Jingxi, Zhenbian (now Mubian), and Long'an. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the people of all ethnic groups launched a revolutionary movement like a raging fire, echoing the revolutionary movement in the Right River area. After the Red Army marched north, the revolutionary movement was severely devastated under the frenzied suppression of the White bandits, and the leadership of the Party was interrupted for a period of time. However, the Zhuang people automatically took up guns and went up the mountains to continue resisting the tyranny of the Kuomintang bandit gangs. In the spring of 1941 and the autumn of 1942, the Party successively sent Party members to Longjin, Mingjiang, Zhenbian and other places to open up work, develop Party organizations, and lead the Zhuang people in revolutionary struggles. In the winter of 1946, the CPC Left River Working Committee was established. In July of the following year, the Zhuang people launched armed uprisings simultaneously in Longjin, Mingjiang, and Zhenbian, liberating nearly 20 townships. This uprising shook the entire Left River area like a storm and boosted the people's confidence in the revolutionary struggle. After the uprising, the enemy army, first with 3,700 people and then with 4,000 people, launched large-scale "mopping-up" operations against the guerrilla base area twice, but were quickly crushed by the guerrillas. Subsequently, the enemy army concentrated its superior forces and adopted the "three all" policy of killing all, burning all, and looting all, launching a cruel "mopping-up" operation against the base area. The guerrillas and the Zhuang people launched a brutal struggle against the Kuomintang bandit army. In the second half of 1948, the guerrillas broke through the enemy's encirclement and used armed work teams to disperse and penetrate into the KMT-controlled areas, from point to line, from line to surface, and finally formed a continuous anti-Chiang guerrilla base area. When liberation was approaching, base areas were established in 16 counties, including Longjin and Jingxi, controlling vast rural areas, with a population of 650,000, and nine county people's governments and a commissioner's office were established.
    Many moving deeds emerged from the struggle between the guerrillas and the Zhuang people and the Kuomintang bandit gangs. The Zhuang people of Naxi in Longjin repelled the "mopping-up" operation of more than 200 KMT bandit security teams three times with five rifles. After the houses of the Zhuang people of Hedu in Longjin were burned down by the Kuomintang bandit army, they built thatched huts on the ruins and continued to fight. After the thatched huts were burned down again, they lived in caves and persisted in the struggle. The Zhuang people of Bujiu Township, supporting the old and carrying the young, insisted on living in the mountains for more than two years and refused to surrender to the enemy. The militiamen and Zhuang people of Jiangzhou Township in Chongzuo County were besieged by the KMT bandit security team in a cave. They persisted for more than a month. When the dry food ran out and the belts were eaten up, they still did not lay down their weapons and waited until the southward army arrived to lift the siege.
    We visited Chunxiu Village in Bujiu Township, which is close to the Vietnamese border and is a stone mountain area. Chunxiu Village is entirely inhabited by Zhuang people and was a revolutionary base area during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the Anti-Japanese War, and the Liberation War.
    Chunxiu Village is named after the martyr Yang Chunxiu, a Communist Party member of this village. Yang Chunxiu was killed by the White bandit army in 1930. At that time, he was a member of the Left River Revolutionary Committee.
    Nong Zhong, secretary of the CPC Party branch, told us that: A Soviet government was established in Chunxiu Village in 1929, and a peasant association was formed. After the Red Army marched north, the underground revolutionary organization left behind was destroyed by the enemy. The villagers who sympathized with the Red Army were killed by the enemy, and their houses were burned down. The Zhuang people missed the Party and the Red Army and hoped that the Red Army could return soon. In 1942, the Party resumed work in Bujiu Township, and the people were overjoyed and enthusiastically joined the guerrillas. In 1946, Kuomintang bandit troops continued to burn, kill, and loot in the Bujiu Township area. The villages in Bujiu Township became desolate, with ruins and ashes everywhere. The heroic Zhuang people, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled to the mountains. The young men of each village took up knives and guns to join the guerrillas, and the people who stayed behind reclaimed wasteland and supported the guerrillas, persisting in the guerrilla war until liberation.
    After liberation, the Party and the People's Government issued relief funds and loans to the old revolutionary base areas. The Zhuang people of Chunxiu Village rebuilt their homes on the ruins. In the winter of 1955, a high-level agricultural cooperative was established. The lives of 70% of the poor and lower-middle peasants in the cooperative have now caught up with the income level of the local well-to-do middle peasants before liberation. All school-age children have entered school. Now Chunxiu Cooperative is carrying out water conservancy construction, fertilizer accumulation, and spring plowing production in full swing. Out of 321 households in the cooperative, 1,000 laborers are working on water conservancy every day. They strive to achieve a yield of "800" jin per mu this year. (Attached picture)

    在左右江两岸
    记僮族群众革命斗争的故事
    本报记者　关君放　黄义杰
    广西僮族自治区成立前夕，记者访问了右江和左江革命老根据地。
    从第一次国内革命战争期间一直到1949年广西解放为止，右江、左江地区的僮、汉、瑶等族人民在中国共产党领导下，二十多年来前仆后继地进行英勇的革命斗争。各族人民用热血写下了可歌可泣的伟大革命诗篇。
    我们访问了右江革命老根据地东兰、巴马瑶族自治县的一带地方。这里石山重重相连，山谷中流着清澈的小河，两岸散布着座座林木葱翠的山村。我们在翠岗环抱的东兰曾晋谒革命烈士陵园，陵园内葬着红七军二十一师师长韦拔群烈士遗骨。在中和乡瞻仰了过去红七军负责人多次集会的地方——奎星楼，1930年初，邓小平同志就住在奎星楼上。在中和乡我们也曾走访列宁岩，1925年韦拔群烈士就在这个岩洞里举办第一期农民运动讲习所。
    我们访问了僮族优秀的儿子共产党员韦拔群烈士的故乡——那烈乡。这里的村庄焕然一新，已经看不见过去白匪军洗劫后的废墟和断壁残垣了。村里除老人和小孩外，家家无闲人，各族农民都在水利工地和田野里劳动着。许多革命老人和当年红七军的老战士，保持了过去光荣的革命传统，虽然他们都是老年人了，但在生产上仍然走在前头。五十多岁的那烈乡女乡长黄春兰是红七军老战士，因为过去长期过着爬山涉水、睡岩洞、吃野菜的战斗生活，如今身体已经很虚弱了。可是她每天除办公外，还要下田或到水利工地参加劳动。她的丈夫革命老人韦钟吉是县特等优抚模范和水利模范。1929年红七军政委邓小平同志亲自指导试办的共耕社会计员黄应周，如今是六十多岁了。他在农业社里照管牛群，把牛养得又肥又壮。
    这里的僮、汉、瑶族农民讲述了许多韦拔群烈士的英雄故事。
    一次，韦拔群同四个战友被三百多国民党匪军包围在一座石山上。经过一阵激烈战斗后，四个战友先后牺牲了。正当危险万分的时候，韦拔群发现脚旁爬出一条小蛇。他把自己戴的草帽把蛇盖住，自己躲在一块石板底下。敌军爬上山以后，到处搜索找不到韦拔群，当拿起草帽发现底下扣着一条蛇时，一个当兵的便吃惊地喊道：“土匪头变成蛇了！”敌军便把草帽和蛇团团围住，一个当官的把当兵的臭骂一顿，又继续搜山，找了很久始终未找到韦拔群，只好带着草帽和蛇去请功去了。当时白匪军在东兰城大肆宣传韦拔群被捉住了，韦拔群是一条蛇变的妖怪，用以瓦解人民革命的斗志。
    又有一次，韦拔群被敌人追赶着。他迅速地跑过一架山岭，跑到一条小河边。河边有一个钓鱼的农民，他见韦拔哥被白匪追赶，他便与韦拔哥换了上衣，戴韦拔哥的草帽，淌到对岸向一条小路跑了。韦拔群便坐在河边钓鱼。敌人赶到河边向钓鱼的吆喝：“看见戴草帽的土匪跑过去了没有？”钓鱼的人不说话，只是用手向河对岸指了指，白匪军果然看见一个戴草帽的人在奔跑，于是淌过河去追赶去了。
    反围剿的游击战争一个胜利接着一个胜利。到1929年初，敌人狼狈地退出了东兰、凤山等县的革命根据地。这一年秋天，邓小平同志和张云逸同志领导起义部队到达田东、田阳、百色等地，与原来韦拔群领导的农民队伍汇合一起，不久正式成立右江苏维埃政府，成立中国工农红军第七军。
    1930年红七军与左江建立的红八军会合后，奉命北上，开往江西中央苏区。出发前，红七军各纵队整编为三个师，韦拔群任二十一师师长，率领一部分部队留在右江坚持武装斗争。
    红七军北上以后，白崇禧匪徒集结了一万多兵力疯狂地向东兰革命根据地进行残酷的扫荡。红军曾给匪军迎头痛击，后因敌我力量悬殊，乃退至西山老根据地。匪军占领了大部苏区，到处烧杀抢掳，仅凤山百乐乡八个村就被烧掉七个，海亭乡一天早上就被杀害二百八十多人。右江革命又进入艰苦的年代。韦拔群带领红军游击队和各族人民与万恶的敌人进行两年多艰苦的斗争，给予敌人很大打击。到1932年由于叛徒出卖，10月20日韦拔群烈士为党为人民伟大的革命事业献出宝贵的生命。
    但是右江的革命斗争之火在继续猛烈地燃烧着，在党的领导下红军游击队和各族人民继续高举着革命的大旗前进。
    东兰、凤山一带革命老根据地许多人还记得当年流行的一首僮族山歌：
    我们是贫苦的农民，烈日像火烧，犁耙也不停；
    吃酸粥，点（一点点的意思）酸菜，衣裤难遮身。
    白匪和土豪，要把脑髓吞；
    多亏出了共产党，领导搞革命，
    张军长，韦拔哥，组织我们，展开红白斗争；
    苏维埃成立，各民族平等；
    打土豪，分田地，大家得翻身。
    白匪反攻来，要把我们杀尽；
    我们团结紧，生死兄弟一样亲；
    不怕断头，不怕流血，誓与白匪拚。
    在这一带有许多人是从第二次国内革命战争坚持到解放的英雄。我们在巴马瑶族自治县访问了“西山三桂”。三桂是僮族共产党员黄联桂、黄柱桂两兄弟和他们的堂兄黄八桂。
    1929年黄联桂兄弟三人参加了革命。在1932年白匪军残酷的“围剿”日子里，三弟兄隐藏在一座山上。为了避免敌人发现，在山上到处转移，露宿在树下和岩石旁。每天吃半顿南瓜和红薯充饥。后来不但南瓜、红薯吃不上了，就是“革命菜”（野菜）也吃光了，只好以嫩草充饥。在这艰难的日子里，有的人下山投降了，人人都说革命失败了。但他们不相信革命会失败，给人打短工糊口，到处找革命组织。1933年冬天，终于找到组织，上级给他们的任务是通过青年去发动壮年和老年对革命的支持，三弟兄回到家乡不到一年，弄竹屯就变成西山主要革命据点之一。许多革命领导同志多次在这里隐蔽和进行革命活动。
    抗日战争爆发不久，当时右江党委书记黄桂南叛变投敌，整个西山地下党组织和党员名单全部暴露。在弄竹屯活动的领导同志转移到别处隐蔽，联桂三弟兄又上山了。敌人派来大批便衣搜捕和暗杀党员和革命干部，敌人还多次派人诱降联桂弟兄，有的亲友也认为革命失败了，劝他们投降，都遭到拒绝。他们种一点畬地，给人打短工，继续做党的交通工作。但连年水灾，地里没有收成，每年只能吃上三个月玉米，其余日子靠吃南瓜、野菜度日。1940年以后，联桂弟兄又拿起武器参加了游击战争，著名的1947年“万岗起义”，红军游击队解放了万岗（即今巴马瑶族自治县）和凤山县城，在战斗的行列里便有联桂三兄弟。
    现在联桂是中共乡党支部书记。八桂和柱桂是农业社员。长期的艰苦生活，他们黑瘦的脸上刻满了粗大的皱纹。说话时精神饱满，不时发出爽朗的笑声。
    解放后，三弟兄回到巴廖乡重建家园。联桂和柱桂都结了婚，安家立业。
    红军和游击队在右江苏区艰苦斗争中，曾发生许多壮烈的英雄事迹。这里记叙一个可歌可泣的事迹。
    1932年9月，白匪军向苏区展开“围剿”，苏区被分割成许多小块，红军少数部队只能在险要的山区里活动，天峨县甘孟峒是这一带石山区最高峰上的一个小山谷，住着三户僮族人家，周围是悬崖和峭陡山坡，只有东南面和西北面的两条小径可以通行。红军黔桂边区独立营八十多人当时被迫退守在这里，四面被白匪军和地主武装民团包围。红军坚守了三天三夜，第四天清晨大雾弥漫，敌人的炮火如猛雨一般，把翠绿的山岗打得变成一片焦黑，许多战士牺牲了。敌人像疯狗似的进行多次冲锋，红军战士子弹打光了，便用石头打，敌人始终无法冲上来，就在这时，十多个民团团丁趁烟雾掩护从悬崖偷爬上来，突破了西北面的坳口。战士们石头打光了之后，便抡起枪托跟敌人肉搏。敌人黑压压一大片爬到山顶，僮族战士罗加红用一对小板刀砍死好几个敌人之后，抱着两个敌人一起跳下悬崖。最后红军战士剩下七个人，每人都抱着一个敌人或是抓住两个敌人一起滚下悬崖。这七名僮族勇士是：黄文明、李奎、黄德东、韦名甫、颜老三、蔺英桥、还有一位女英雄兰彩娥。
    我们也曾到左江地区访问。左江地区有着悠久的革命历史传统，在1930年，红七军、红八军的活动遍及整个地区。在龙津、靖西、镇边（现为睦边）、隆安等县建立过苏维埃政权。各族人民在中国共产党领导下，掀起了如火如荼的革命运动。与右江革命运动互相呼应。红军北上后，在白匪疯狂镇压下，革命运动受到严重摧残，曾经有一段时间中断党的领导。但僮族人民自动拿起枪上山，继续反抗国民党匪帮的暴政。党在1941年春天和1942年秋天，先后派去党员到龙津、明江和镇边等地，开辟工作，发展党的组织，领导僮族人民进行革命斗争。1946年冬天，建立了中共左江工委会。第二年7月，发动僮族人民在龙津、明江和镇边三地同时举行武装起义，解放了近二十个乡。这次起义如风暴一般地震撼了整个左江地区，鼓舞了人民革命斗争的信心。起义后，敌军第一次三千七百多人，第二次四千多人，两次向游击根据地进行大规模的扫荡，结果很快都被游击队粉碎。随后敌军集中优势兵力，采取杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光”政策，向根据地进行残酷的扫荡，游击队和僮族人民与国民党匪军展开残酷的斗争。1948年下半年游击队打破了敌人的包围，运用武装工作队形式分散插出到蒋管区，由点到线，由线到面，最后连成一片反蒋游击根据地。快要解放时，在龙津、靖西等十六个县内建立了根据地，控制了广大农村，拥有人口六十五万人，建立了九个县人民政府及一个专员公署。
    游击队和僮族人民在和国民党匪帮斗争中，出现许多动人的事迹。龙津那息的僮族人民前后三次用五支步枪，打退二百多蒋匪保安队的扫荡。龙津河渡僮族人民房屋被国民党匪军烧毁后，在废墟上搭起茅屋，继续战斗。以后茅屋又被烧毁，便住山洞坚持斗争。布局乡僮族人民扶老携幼坚持在山上住两年多，坚持不向敌人投降。崇左县江洲乡民兵和僮族人民被蒋匪保安队围困在山洞中，坚持一个多月，干粮吃尽，皮带吃光，也不放下武器，一直等到南下大军到来才解围。
    我们访问了布局乡春秀村，这里靠近越南边境，是石山地区。春秀村全是僮族人，在第二次国内革命战争期间、抗日战争期间和解放战争期间，都是革命根据地。
    春秀村是以本村共产党员杨春秀烈士的名字命名的。杨春秀于1930年为白匪军杀害，当时他是左江革命委员会委员。
    中共党支部书记农众告诉我们说：在1929年春秀村建立过苏维埃政权，成立了农民协会。红军北上以后，留下的地下革命组织被敌人破坏，村上同情红军的人被敌人杀害，房子被烧毁，僮族人民怀念党和红军，盼望红军能早日回来。1942年党又在布局乡开展工作，人民莫不欢欣鼓舞，踊跃地参加游击队。1946年国民党匪军不断到布局乡一带烧杀抢掠。布局乡各村变成了一片荒凉，到处是断壁残垣和灰烬，英勇的僮族人民扶老携幼逃到山上，各村青年男人拿起刀枪参加游击队，留下的人，开荒生产支持游击队，坚持游击战争一直到解放。
    解放后，党和人民政府对革命老根据地发救济款和贷款，春秀村僮族人民在废墟上重建家园。1955年冬建立了高级农业社，社内70％的贫雇农现在生活已赶上解放前当地富裕中农收入的水平。适龄学童全部入了学校。现在春秀社正紧张地进行修水利、积肥、春耕生产，全社三百二十一户，每天修水利就出工一千个劳动力，他们争取今年实现亩产“八百”斤社。（附图片）
