　　Daring to Think and Daring to Do: Small Factories Create Miracles
　　-- A Record of the Capital's Local Industrial Production Leap Forward Exhibition
  　By our staff reporters
    The Capital's Local Industrial Production Leap Forward Exhibition is currently underway. This exhibition reflects, through thousands of excellent products, how many small and poor factories, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, have organized the wisdom and talents of their workers and staff into technological reforms, thereby creating many miracles in production and greatly improving production levels.

    During the First Five-Year Plan, the average annual growth rate of Beijing's local industry was 23%. This year, the planned growth rate has increased to 50%. In the first quarter of this year, the state's output value plan was overfulfilled by 6.2%. More importantly, many workers and staff, through hard work and diligent effort, have broken down superstitions about industrial technology, liberated their thinking, and dared to think and dared to do, thus creating many "miracles" in production. This exhibition fully reflects this situation.

    Poor factories with high aspirations, small factories doing big things, the exhibits at the exhibition prominently illustrate this aspect. The Beijing Bacterial Fertilizer Factory, under conditions of lacking buildings, equipment, and weak technical strength, learned as they went and worked practically, and successfully trial-produced antibiotic fertilizer before the spring sowing according to the expected plan. Using this fertilizer, it only costs 36 cents per mu of land, and production can be increased by 10% to 30%. The Beijing No. 1 Dyeing and Weaving Factory, known as broken and tattered, in order to produce the best-selling "Feili Silk" for export, obtained foreign samples from the silk company, pieced together machines from waste materials, and went to brother factories to learn technology. They spent 120 yuan to modify two old machines and trial-produced the nationally first-created "Feili Silk" in a simple and crude way. After the successful trial production, they vacated the office as a workshop and searched for broken machines from other factories as equipment. On this basis, according to the contracts signed with the country and foreign countries, they will produce "Feili Silk" worth 750,000 US dollars this year. Similar unimaginable deeds in the past can be seen from the exhibition as relatively common situations.

    The exhibits at the exhibition also tell people that in the hard work of the broad masses of workers and staff, a mass technological reform movement is taking shape. The interpreters at the exhibition emphasized that each exhibit was the result of the broad masses of workers reforming and improving technology when introducing them to the audience. Among the exhibits is cashmere from the Qinghe Woolen Mill, which is a world-famous product, and China's output accounts for 70% of the world's total output. In the past, because China could not separate the coarse wool from the cashmere, it could only export raw wool in large quantities. This time, the leading cadres and workers of the Qinghe Woolen Mill fought hard together for 53 days, and after many failures and repeated modifications, they successfully transformed the cashmere combing machine with old machines. The cashmere produced reached the standard of British products. The semiconductor thermoelectric generator of the jointly-owned Chaoyang Motor Factory, which was exhibited at the conference, had researchers related to semiconductors who once told the workers of the factory during the trial production process: "According to your equipment conditions, it is impossible to succeed at all." He told them to pack up their ambitions as soon as possible and not to take risks. However, with the strong support of the factory's leading cadres, three technicians and a worker finally succeeded in trial production. Among the exhibits are also self-made semiconductor radios as big as palms, Beijing ink that catches up with the American Parker brand, metallic sodium that catches up with imports from Japan, and other products. These products are manufactured in small and poor factories, which eloquently illustrates that once workers break the gate of mystification in production technology, they will generate great power. The Beijing Chemical Factory, which has done a better job in this regard, had 33 products that reached international standards in the first quarter.

    The exhibition also comprehensively reflects the thriving atmosphere of Beijing's local industry in the first four months of this year. The exhibition showcased 796 new products from January to April, which is close to the total number of new products in the entire year of last year, and some of them have never been produced in China before. Members of handicraft cooperatives have also trial-produced more than 5,000 new products and new designs. Enterprises under the Second Local Industry Bureau alone have successfully trial-produced 269 new products, more than four times the number in the same period last year, and 79 more than the entire year of last year. After learning from advanced units across the country, more than 60 products have improved their quality, and 15 have reached advanced levels. Due to the significant improvement in product quality, there has been a substantial increase in export varieties. A chart in the exhibition hall of the Beijing Electrical Industry Company indicates that their products have been sold to more than 30 countries around the world. The number of handicraft products that met export standards in the first quarter also increased three times compared with previous years. This situation makes people believe that the city's local industry, with full energy, can create a new situation rapidly on the basis of backwardness by making the best use of simple equipment and gradually improving.

    The exhibition also showcased the products of work-study programs in schools, a vital force in industrial production. Among them are more than a dozen self-made precision instruments from Tsinghua University and wooden water turbines for rural small hydropower stations. The Aviation Institute trial-produced precision bench lathes and the 58-2 model stress measurement instrument system of the Motherland brand. These products all have a fairly high technical level. The Beijing Telecommunications School exhibited a three-purpose switchboard that can be used simultaneously for rural broadcasting networks, telephone networks, and telephone conferences. Many schools also exhibited a large number of machines and parts produced in collaboration with industrial enterprises. In order to serve agricultural production, teachers and students of the Beijing Chemical Industry School are designing and building a fertilizer powder factory with an annual output of 1,000 tons, which is expected to be completed by the end of May.

    Participating in this exhibition were hundreds of factories under the local industrial bureaus of Beijing, many handicraft production cooperatives, and 29 higher engineering colleges and secondary technical schools. Among the thousands of exhibits, there are many products supporting socialist construction in agriculture, a large number of industrial construction supplies, people's daily necessities and export commodities, and many advanced scientific instruments. During the exhibition, many factory workers, cooperative members, and school teachers and students came to visit, observe, and learn from each other.

　　敢想又敢干　小厂出奇迹
　　——记首都地方工业生产跃进汇报展览会
  　本报记者集体采访
    首都地方工业生产跃进汇报展览会正在举行。这个展览会通过成千种优良产品，反映了许多小厂穷厂在生产大跃进的新形势下，由于把职工群众的聪明才智组织到技术改革中来，因此在生产上出现了很多奇迹，大大地提高了生产水平。
    北京市地方工业在第一个五年计划期间，每年的平均速度是23％，今年的计划速度已增长到50％。今年第一季度超额6.2％完成了国家的产值计划。更重要的是许多职工在穷干苦干中打破了对工业技术的迷信，解放了思想，敢想、敢干，因此在生产上涌现出不少“奇迹”。这个展览会充分地反映了这种情况。
    厂穷志不穷，小厂干大事，展览会上的展品突出地说明了这方面的问题。北京细菌肥料厂在没房子、缺设备、技术力量很差的条件下，现学实干，按照预期计划在春播前试制成功了抗生菌肥料。用这种肥料，每亩地只需费三角六分钱，就可以增产10％到30％。被人们称为破破烂烂的北京市染织第一厂，为了生产畅销国外的“飞利绸”，从丝绸公司找来外国样品，从废料里拼凑机器，到兄弟工厂去学习技术，花费了一百二十元改装了两台旧机器，因陋就简地试制出全国首创的“飞利绸”来。在试制成功以后，他们把办公室腾出作车间，到外厂搜罗破机器作设备，就在这样的基础上，根据国家和国外签订的合同，在今年内要生产价值七十五万美元的“飞利绸”。类似这样过去难以想像的事迹，从展览中可以看出是较为普遍的情况。
    展览会上的展品还告诉人们：在广大职工群众穷干苦干中，一个群众性的技术改革运动正在形成。展览会上的解释员向观众介绍每种展品时，都着重指出它是广大职工改革技术提高技术的结果。展品中有清河制呢厂的山羊绒，这是世界上的名贵产品，而我国产量占世界总产量的70％。过去由于我国不能把山羊毛中的粗毛分梳出来，只能大量出口原毛。这次清河制呢厂的领导干部和职工共同苦战了五十三天，经多次失败，反复改装，用旧机器改造山羊绒分梳机成功了，制出的山羊绒达到了英国产品的标准。会上展出的公私合营朝阳电机厂的半导体温差发电器，在试制过程中，研究半导体的有关人员曾经告诉这个厂的职工说：“按照你们的设备条件，是根本无法成功的。”他让他们趁早收拾雄心，不要冒险。但是在工厂领导干部的大力支持下，三个技术人员和一个工人终于把它试制成功了。在展品中还有自制的大如手掌的半导体收音机，质量赶上美国派克牌的北京墨水，赶上从日本进口的金属钠等等产品。这些产品在又小又穷的工厂里制造出来，雄辩地说明了职工们一旦打破了生产技术上神秘化的大门，就产生出极大的力量。这方面成绩较好的北京化工厂，第一季度中就有三十三种产品达到了国际水平。
    展览会上还综合反映了北京地方工业在今年头四个月中一片欣欣向荣的气象。展览会展出的1至4月份新产品有七百九十六种，已经接近去年全年新产品的总数，有些是国内从未生产过的。手工业合作社社员们，也试制成五千多种新产品和新花样。第二地方工业局所属企业就试制成功了二百六十九种新产品，比去年同一时期多四倍以上，比去年全年还多七十九种。他们经过向全国先进单位学习，还有六十多种产品提高了质量，十五种赶上先进水平。由于产品质量的显著提高，出口品种大有增加。北京市电器工业公司展览室内一张图表标明，他们的产品已经行销世界上三十多个国家。手工业产品第一季达到出口标准的也比往年增加了三倍。这种情况，使人们深信，全市地方工业，鼓足干劲，因陋就简，逐步提高，完全可能在落后的基础上迅速开创出新局面。
    展览会还展出了工业生产上的一支生力军——学校勤工俭学的产品。其中，有清华大学的十来种自制的精密仪器和供给农村小型水力发电站用的木质水轮机。航空学院试制的精密台式车床和祖国牌58—2型应力测量仪器系统。这些产品都具有相当高的技术水平。北京电信学校展出了可供农村广播网、电话网和开电话会议同时应用的三用交换机。好多学校还展出了大量与工业企业部门协作生产的机器和部件。北京化学工业学校为了为农业生产服务，师生们正在自己设计自己兴建一座年产一千吨的肥田粉厂，预计5月底可以完工。
    参加这次展览会的有北京市各地方工业局所属的几百个工厂，许多手工业生产合作社和二十九个高等工科院校、中等技术学校。在成千件的展品中，有许多支援农业社会主义建设的产品，有大量工业建设用品、人民生活用品和出口商品，还有许多高级的科学仪器。展览期间，有许多工厂职工、合作社社员和学校师生员工来参观，互相观摩、学习。
