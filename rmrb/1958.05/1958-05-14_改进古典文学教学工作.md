　　Improving Classical Literature Teaching
　　From the content of the "Chinese Classical Literature Teaching Syllabus" of institutions of higher learning, it can be seen that the compilers' bourgeois teaching ideology is very serious. This is mainly manifested in the simple emphasis on the system of literary history, without paying attention to political standards. Chairman Mao once taught us that in inheriting the literary heritage of the motherland, we must "discard its feudal dross and absorb its democratic essence." The textbook itself has not well implemented this principle. For example, the selection of writers related to Tang, Five Dynasties, and Song lyrics in the textbook involves nearly thirty writers, and more than one hundred and forty works are explained. In fact, some writers and works can be talked about less, and some are best not talked about at all, especially those lyrics that depict decadent sentiments and morbid images, such as Feng Yansi's "Small hills overlap, golden light flickers," Yan Jidao's "Colored sleeves diligently hold jade cups," and Li Qingzhao's "Searching and searching, desolate and lonely, dreary and wretched." When discussing these works, we must analyze and criticize them. In the past, when these lyrics were discussed, there was insufficient analysis and criticism, which brought about adverse effects. After reading such works, some people are cold towards political life and the socialist cause. What they think about is not a communist society, but a longing for the life of a hermit with "a residence of more than ten acres and eight or nine thatched huts," planning to write books and establish themselves in such living conditions. People with slight ideological problems are prone to poisoning after reading "Singing to wine, how much is life?" and "Poems of sorrow" and "Poems of seclusion." Judging from the adverse effects caused by the current teaching, this is obviously not in line with the educational policy of cultivating socialist intellectuals.
　　The teaching of Chinese classical literature in institutions of higher learning cannot be divorced from reality, nor can it be separated from the new educational policy. Our teaching work should also take politics as the commander. I hope that the textbooks and teaching work of Chinese classical literature in institutions of higher learning should also undergo a major reform, in which political standards should be put in the first place.

### 改进古典文学教学工作

　　改进古典文学教学工作
    从高等学校的“中国古典文学教学大纲”的内容中，可以看出编者的资产阶级教学思想是很严重的。主要表现在单纯强调文学史的系统，没有注意政治标准。毛主席曾经教导我们在继承祖国文学遗产方面要“剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华”。教材本身没有很好地贯彻这个原则。如教材中对唐、五代、宋词的编选涉及的作家近三十个，讲解的作品有一百四十多首。其实，有些作家和作品可以少讲，有些最好是不讲，特别像那些描绘颓废感伤和病态形象的词，例如冯延已的“小山重叠金明灭”、晏几道的“彩袖殷勤捧玉钟”、李清照的“寻寻觅觅，冷冷清清，凄凄惨惨戚戚”之类的作品，在讲时就要有分析批判地讲。由于过去讲这些词时，分析批判的不够，带来了不良影响，有的人读了这类作品以后，对政治生活、社会主义事业是冷冰冰的，脑子里所想的不是共产主义社会，而是向往着“方宅十余亩，草屋八九间”的隐士生活，打算在这种生活条件下著书立说，成名、成家。思想稍有问题的人，读了“对酒当歌，人生几何”和“悲愤诗”“幽情诗”之后，就容易中毒。从目前教学中所造成的不良影响来看，这显然与培养社会主义的知识分子的教育方针是不相符合的。
    高等学校的中国古典文学教学，不能脱离实际，不能离开新的教育方针。我们的教学工作也应该以政治为统帅。我希望高等学校的中国古典文学的教材和教学工作，也应当来个大改革，在改革中，应当把政治标准放在第一位。
