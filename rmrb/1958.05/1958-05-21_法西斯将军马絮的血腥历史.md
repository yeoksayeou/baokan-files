    The Bloody History of Fascist General Massu
    Question: Who is Jacques Massu, the French paratrooper head who launched the riot in Algiers?
　　　　　　Beijing Wang Feng
    Answer: Jacques Massu, the leader of the riots in Algiers, the notorious French fascist, and paratrooper general, is a veteran war criminal with blood on his hands.
    Jacques Massu was born in 1908. He joined the army early and served as an infantryman in the French colonial army. During World War II, Massu joined De Gaulle and joined the "Free French" movement, participating in the Chad battle in North Africa. After the war, Massu was sent to Indochina to participate in the French army's armed invasion of southern Vietnam, massacring the Vietnamese people. In 1947, Massu returned to France and was appointed commander of the North African French Paratrooper Brigade. In 1955, he was appointed inspector of the North African French Airborne Forces. In 1956, Massu became commander of the 10th Paratrooper Division. Under Massu's leadership, this paratrooper division used various torture methods of the Hitler German secret police to brutally kill many Algerian patriotic people. The heinous crimes of the 10th Paratrooper Division aroused the anger of people all over the world.
    In November 1956, when the Anglo-French invading forces landed in Port Said, Massu was the commander of the paratrooper forces. In this way, he became another butcher who slaughtered the Egyptian people.
    In early 1957, Massu returned to Algiers and was responsible for intelligence work in Algiers. Under the pretext of maintaining public order, Massu used paratrooper forces to implement a reign of terror in Algiers, cruelly suppressing the Algerian people's liberation struggle.
    On May 13 this year, Massu instigated some French paratrooper forces in the Algerian region to launch a fascist riot. He served as the chairman of the "Committee of Public Safety" composed of rioters in Algiers, and issued a communique openly demanding that De Gaulle come to power in order to destroy the French republican system and step up the suppression of the Algerian national liberation struggle.

    法西斯将军马絮的血腥历史
    问：在阿尔及尔发动暴乱的法国伞兵头子雅克·马絮是个什么样的人呢？
　　　　　　北京王峰
    答：阿尔及利亚首府阿尔及尔暴乱的领导人、声名狼籍的法国法西斯分子、伞兵将军马絮，是一个双手沾满鲜血的老牌战犯。
    雅克·马絮生于1908年。早年入伍，充当了法国殖民军的一个步兵。第二次世界大战时期，马絮投靠戴高乐，加入了“自由法国”运动，参加过北非乍得战役。战后，马絮被派往印度支那，参加法国军队向越南南部进行的武装侵略，屠杀越南人民。1947年，马絮返回法国，受任为北非法国伞兵大队司令。1955年，被任命为北非法国空运部队监察官。1956年，马絮出任伞兵第十师师长。在马絮的领导下，这个伞兵师使用了希特勒德国秘密警察各种严刑逼供的办法，残杀了许多阿尔及利亚爱国志士。伞兵第十师的滔天罪行，激起了全世界人民的愤怒。
    1956年11月，英法侵略军在塞得港登陆时，马絮是伞兵部队的指挥。这样，他又成了屠杀埃及人民的刽子手。
    1957年年初，马絮回到阿尔及尔，负责阿尔及尔的特务工作。马絮假借治安的名义，使用伞兵部队在阿尔及尔实行了恐怖统治，残酷地镇压阿尔及利亚人民的解放斗争。
    今年5月13日，马絮策动法国在阿尔及利亚地区的一些伞兵部队发动了法西斯的暴乱。他充当阿尔及尔暴乱分子组成的“救国委员会”的主席，并发表公报，公然要求戴高乐上台，以摧毁法国共和制度，加紧镇压阿尔及利亚的民族解放斗争。
