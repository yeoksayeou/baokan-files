　　Rambling About the Writing Brush
　　Zhao Jiemin
　　The old-fashioned writing brush in our country is made of goat hair and weasel hair, so it is called a "writing brush." Since the advent of fountain pens, not many people use writing brushes anymore. However, calligraphers and traditional Chinese painters cannot do without them for even a moment. The evolution of the writing brush has its own history.

　　The inscriptions on oracle bones from the Shang Dynasty were all carved with knife-pens. However, at that time, there was no name for knife-pen; instead, it was called "xiao" (削, to pare). During the Zhou Dynasty, bamboo slips became popular, and then the term "pen" appeared. The shape of the knife-pen was that of a slanted knife, made of bamboo, and could be used to write with ink. Although there was already a method of writing on silk during the late Zhou Dynasty, bamboo slips were still the main medium. Therefore, knife-pens were still used. If a character was written incorrectly, it could be scraped off with a knife-pen. The "Records of the Grand Historian, Family of Confucius" says that Confucius used a "xiao" when writing the Spring and Autumn Annals.

　　It is said that the Qin Dynasty general Meng Tian began to make writing brushes. The "Records of the Grand Historian" says that Meng Tian used rabbit hair from Zhongshan (present-day Zhengding area of Hebei Province) to make brushes. As for how Meng Tian's brushes were actually made, the "Annotations on Ancient and Modern Matters" says that Meng Tian used dried wood as the brush handle, deer hair as the core, and goat hair covering the surrounding area, bound to the inside of the handle. Deer hair is hard, and goat hair is soft, which not only allows for absorbing more ink but also makes writing suitably soft and firm. Therefore, the writing brush replaced the knife-pen.

　　Silk books were more common in the Western Han Dynasty, and paper was invented in the Eastern Han Dynasty. Although the use of bamboo slips was still widespread, and knife-pens were not completely abandoned, the knife-pens used at this time were different from those in the Zhou Dynasty. The pen was used exclusively for writing, while the knife was used exclusively for scraping off incorrect characters.

　　By the Jin Dynasty, paper had become very popular, and bamboo slips were gradually replaced by paper. The knife-pen was also abandoned along with them. Therefore, there are no records of knife-pens after the Jin Dynasty. And the great calligrapher Wang Xizhi, who was skilled in using writing brushes, appeared. Since then, writing brushes have generally been made with bamboo handles and rabbit hair, with continuous improvements.

    闲话毛笔
  　赵捷民
    我国旧用的笔，用羊毛和鼬毛作成，所以叫做毛笔，自从有了钢笔以后，用毛笔的已不太多。但是书法家、国画家还是一时一刻离不了的。毛笔的沿革，有它的一段历史。
    商代的龟甲文，都是用刀笔来刻划字。但是当时还没有刀笔这个名称，而称为“削”。周朝竹简盛行，于是才有了笔的称呼。刀笔的形状是斜刀形，由竹制成，可以蘸墨写字。周末虽然已经有了在帛上写字的办法，但是主要还是竹简。所以仍用刀笔。字写错了可用刀笔削去。“史记孔子世家”说孔子作春秋，就用过削。
    相传秦朝大将蒙恬开始造毛笔。“史记”说蒙恬取中山（河北正定一带）兔毛造笔。至于蒙恬的笔究竟是怎样造的呢？“古今注”说，蒙恬以枯木为笔管，鹿毛为心，羊毛盖于四周，束于管里。鹿毛硬，羊毛软，不但能含汲较多的墨汁，而且写起来也软硬适宜。因此毛笔就代替了刀笔。
    西汉帛书较普遍，东汉更发明了纸，虽然竹简应用还很多，刀笔也没有全废。但此时所用刀笔和周时已有不同。笔专用于写字，刀则专作削去错字之用。
    晋朝时，纸已大兴盛，竹简逐渐被纸代替，刀笔也就随着废了。所以晋以后就没有关于刀笔的记载了。而善用毛笔的大书法家王羲之也出现了。此后一般造笔都用竹管和兔毛，不断地有所改进。
