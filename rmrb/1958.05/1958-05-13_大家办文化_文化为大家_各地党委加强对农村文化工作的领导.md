　　The Masses Run Culture, Culture for the Masses
    Party Committees in Various Regions Strengthen Leadership Over Rural Cultural Work

    (By Our Reporter Zhang Lijun) "The Secretary Takes Command, the Whole Party Gets Moving" – this is the key to the healthy development of rural cultural activities, as many representatives at the National Rural Mass Cultural Work Conference pointed out. Experience in various regions proves that wherever the Party committee attaches importance to strengthening leadership, mass cultural organizations centered on rural clubs can closely coordinate with production and political tasks to play a role in propaganda and mobilization. The masses' production enthusiasm becomes vigorous, and their cultural life is considerably satisfied.

    In strengthening their leadership over rural cultural work, the CCP committees in various regions have, first of all, grasped ideology and ensured that cultural work serves politics and production. As a result, they have changed the inappropriate view held by some cadres that rural cultural work is merely for fun and games. After agricultural cooperation, the broad masses of peasants further developed the desire to carry out amateur cultural activities. They are not satisfied with just watching others perform; they also want to write, perform, sing, and enjoy themselves in order to achieve self-education. Thus, new problems have emerged for the vast number of grassroots cadres in rural areas: Should they only lead production and ignore the cultural needs of the masses? Or should they focus on production and, with the development of production, strengthen leadership over rural cultural work, thereby promoting both production and central tasks, and satisfying the cultural needs of the masses? In the beginning, cadres had different understandings: Some believed that if they didn't engage in production, they wouldn't have food to eat, but if they didn't lead cultural work, they wouldn't starve to death; others believed that they were laymen and couldn't lead cultural work; still others, upon hearing about cultural and recreational activities, thought of extravagant displays, buying opera costumes, and performing grand operas, without linking them to production and central tasks. In response to these problems, many Party committees, through debates and examples, educated cadres to recognize the relationship between culture and production, that is, socialist culture serves production and its ideological content promotes production, enabling them to gradually shift from not attaching importance to rural cultural work to actively leading rural cultural work. The CCP Xiyang County Committee in Shanxi Province used vivid facts to educate cadres throughout the county on the relationship between cultural activities and production, achieving good results. In Zhao Bi Village of this county, a quick-board rhyme inspired Wang Xiaobai, who had always been poor at labor, to work hard and break the new record for soil carrying in the entire cooperative. In Sile Township of this county, lantern slides were used to commend and criticize, transforming a lazy person who had repeatedly failed to reform. These facts have made cadres realize that they must be able to lead both production and culture, and make culture closely coordinate with production. Currently, in places where production is good and culture is also good, mass cultural organizations centered on clubs have indeed become a "treasure."

    On the basis of unifying ideological understanding, Party committees in various regions have taken a series of specific measures in leading rural cultural work. At present, the Party committees of many counties and townships generally have a secretary or deputy secretary in charge of cultural propaganda work. The directors of central clubs in many townships are concurrently held by the propaganda committee member or deputy township head of the township Party committee. The directors of agricultural cooperative clubs are held by the propaganda committee member or Communist Youth League secretary of the Party branch. Many county and township Party committees have included cultural work on their agendas, enabling rural cultural work to be uniformly arranged with other tasks and closely linked to political and production tasks. The CCP Qishui County Committee in Hubei Province has adopted a method of "one management" (secretary takes action, the whole party takes action), "six grasps" (grasping ideology, grasping deployment and inspection, grasping advanced examples, grasping the combination of key points and overall areas, grasping flexibility and diversity, grasping the team), and "five combinations" (combining political propaganda with cultural and recreational activities, combining cultural and recreational activities with literacy, sports, and the elimination of the four pests) to lead rural cultural work.

    The CCP Yixing County Committee in Jiangsu Province has repeatedly implemented the principle of rural cultural activities serving production and central tasks in leading rural cultural work, and struggled against erroneous tendencies that deviate from this principle. In the past, some key cultural and recreational activists believed that engaging in cultural activities was only for their own personal glory. Wang Baoqi, the head of the Zhuhe Rural Troupe, only performed grand operas and once went to Shanghai to spend more than 200 yuan on costumes, not only failing to serve production but also affecting production. The county and township Party committees corrected the deviation through debates and other methods, guiding rural cultural activities in the right direction. During the winter large-scale production campaign and rural rectification movement last year, the "Think about the past, compare with the present, look to the future" physical object exhibition held by the Shuikou Agricultural Cooperative in this county provided a profound socialist education for the masses. The county party committee sent people to the scene to convene a meeting to promote this experience, truly giving rural mass culture a soul and achieving "politics in command."

    In many places, due to the strengthened leadership of the Party, mass cultural activities in rural areas, with the Communist Youth League as the backbone, quickly became mass actions once launched. This spring, Changli County in Hebei Province launched a singing movement. From the secretaries of the county and township Party committees to the entire Party, everyone took action together to carry out singing instruction activities. The Party secretaries of Xishan, Matuodian and other townships not only organized the masses to learn to sing, but also participated in singing groups to take the lead in singing. Socialist singing activities quickly formed a climax in this county. This county is now also carrying out mass "mural" activities. The entire county has seen a situation of "songs rising everywhere" and "poems and paintings covering the mountains."

    Will rural mass cultural work be squeezed out by other work? Experience in various regions proves that as long as rural cultural activities form a mass activity under the leadership of the Party committee, and under the unified leadership of the Party committee, relevant units (Communist Youth League, Women's Federation, etc.) are mobilized to cooperate and achieve "everyone runs culture, culture for everyone," the contradiction between cultural work and other tasks can be overcome, and cultural work will not be squeezed out.

### 大家办文化　文化为大家  各地党委加强对农村文化工作的领导

　　大家办文化　文化为大家
    各地党委加强对农村文化工作的领导
    本报讯　记者张丽君报道：“书记挂帅，全党动手”，这是全国农村群众文化工作会议上很多代表提出来的农村文化活动健康发展的关键。各地经验证明，凡是党委重视加强领导的地方，以农村俱乐部为中心的群众文化组织就能够密切地配合生产、配合政治任务起宣传鼓动的作用，群众的生产情绪也就生气勃勃，文化生活也因此得到相当的满足。
    各地中共党委在加强对农村文化工作的领导时，由于首先抓思想，抓文化工作为政治、为生产服务，因而，改变了某些干部认为农村文化工作不过是玩玩乐乐的不恰当的看法。在农业合作化以后，广大农民进一步产生了开展业余文化活动的愿望，他们看了别人演戏还不过瘾，而且要自编、自演、自唱、自乐以达到自我教育的目的。这样，在广大农村基层干部面前就出现了新的问题：是只领导生产，不管群众的文化要求？还是以生产为中心，随着生产的发展加强对农村文化工作的领导，从而既推动生产和中心任务，又满足群众的文化要求？在开始的时候，干部思想上的认识是不同的：有的认为不搞生产吃不上饭，不领导文化却饿不死人；有的认为自己是外行，领导不了文化；有的一听说搞文娱，就想到讲排场，买戏箱，演大戏，不结合生产和中心任务。许多党委针对这些问题，通过辩论和实例，教育干部认识文化同生产的关系，即社会主义文化既服务于生产同时它的思想内容又推动生产前进，使他们从不重视农村文化工作逐步转到积极领导农村文化工作。中共山西省昔阳县委通过生动的事实，向全县干部进行文化活动和生产关系的教育，得到较好的效果。这个县的赵璧村通过一首快板，使一贯劳动不好的王小白鼓起了干劲，并突破全社挑土新纪录；这个县的思乐乡通过幻灯展开表扬批评，改造了屡教不改的懒汉。这些事实，都使干部认识到既要会领导生产又要会领导文化，使文化密切配合生产。目前在生产好文化也好的地方，以俱乐部为中心的群众文化组织确实成为一“宝”。
    在统一思想认识的基础上，各地党委在领导农村文化工作上都采取了一系列的具体措施。目前许多县乡的党委一般都由一位书记或副书记主管文化宣传工作，许多乡的中心俱乐部主任都是由乡党委宣传委员或副乡长兼任，农业社俱乐部的主任由党支部宣传委员或共青团书记担任。许多县乡党委都把文化工作列入议事日程，使农村文化工作能同其他各项工作得到统一安排，并且使它同政治任务和生产任务密切结合。中共湖北省浠水县委采取一管（书记动手，全党动手）、六抓（抓思想、抓布置检查、抓先进、抓点面结合、抓灵活多样、抓队伍）、五结合（政治宣传与文娱活动结合、文娱活动同扫盲、体育、除四害活动结合等）的办法来领导农村文化工作。
    中共江苏省宜兴县委在领导农村文化工作中反复贯彻农村文化活动为生产和中心工作服务的方针，同离开这个方针的错误倾向做斗争。过去有些文娱活动骨干认为搞文化活动只是为了自己出风头，邾和农村剧团团长王宝琪只演大剧，并曾跑到上海花二百多元买服装，不但不为生产服务，反而影响了生产。县乡党委就通过辩论等方法纠正偏向，把农村文化活动引向了正确的方向。在去年冬季大生产运动中和农村整风运动中，这个县水龙口农业社举办的“想想过去，比比现在，看看将来”的实物展览，对群众进行了深刻的社会主义教育，县委便派人到现场召开会议，推广这个经验，真正使农村群众文化有了灵魂，做到“政治挂帅”。
    很多地方的农村群众文化活动由于党加强了领导，以共青团为骨干，一经发动就很快成为群众性的行动。河北省昌黎县今春发动歌唱运动，从县乡的党委书记到全党都一齐动手，展开教唱活动。西山、马坨店等乡的党委书记不仅组织群众学唱，自己也参加歌唱团带头歌唱，社会主义歌唱活动很快地就在这个县形成了高潮，这个县现在还开展了群众性的“壁画”活动，全县已经出现了“歌声遍地起”、“诗画满墙山”的局面。
    农村群众文化工作会不会被其他工作挤掉？各地经验证明，只要农村文化活动在党委领导下形成群众性的活动，并且在党委统一领导下发动有关单位（共青团、妇联等）共同协作，实现“大家办文化，文化为大家”，就能克服文化工作同其他各项工作的矛盾，文化工作就不会被挤掉。
