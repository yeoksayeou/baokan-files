    "Five Raids"
  　by Li Shuzhi
    In the agricultural production movement, there are often raid activities. Some say raids are good, some say raids are bad, but neither has explained the specific reasons, so the problem is still not clearly demonstrated.
    The peasants themselves have put forward the concept of "Five Raids": First, raid the backwardness to catch up with the advanced; if a unit or a task is backward, it needs to be raided to catch up with the advanced. Second, raid difficulties to break the road; if a task has no experience and has difficulties, it needs to be raided to break through a point, make a model, gain experience, encourage confidence, open up a road, and drive the overall situation. Third, raid time to seize the season; if time is tight and the opportunity cannot be missed, it needs to be raided to seize the opportunity and not violate the farming season. Fourth, raid the beginning to transfer to the regular; if a new task, everyone is not familiar with it, not used to it, it is necessary to raid it, create momentum, make a good start and lay a foundation, so as to truly be able to adhere to it regularly. Fifth, raid completion to catch up with the task; if a task is nearing completion and the scheduled deadline is approaching, it needs to be raided to complete all the tasks in one go.
    In this way, the problem becomes clear: the role of raids, the conditions for raids, under what circumstances raids are needed, how to use raids, the relationship between raids and overall work, the relationship between raids and regular work... etc., all have correct answers. In this way, it is neither a generalized and simplistic emphasis on raids, nor a generalized and simplistic opposition to raids, but a detailed analysis of raids, thus giving a fair evaluation of raids. It is convincing to affirm the role of raids in this way; it is also convincing to refute the arguments against raids in this way.
    Today's peasants, probably most of them have not had time to study philosophy, and may not be familiar with the principles of dialectics, but their saying of "Five Raids" is so in line with the objective laws of agricultural production and is a dialectical point of view.
    Then, this matter tells us exactly that the source of knowledge is practice, and after repeated practice, people can reach the understanding of objective truth. Of course, if practitioners like peasants understand the principles of philosophy, in addition to bringing great impetus to production, how much promotion they will bring to the understanding of objective truth and to the development of science and philosophy is probably difficult to estimate.
    And those who have "knowledge" need to go to practice to enrich themselves and develop their understanding as soon as possible. They can also talk about the empty theories of whether raids are good or bad, but they are far less profound and specific than the "Five Raids", which also illustrates this point.

    “五突击”
  　黎庶之
    在农业生产运动中，时常有突击活动。有人说突击很好，有人说突击不好，但是都没有说出具体道理，所以问题还是论证得不清楚。
    农民们自己提出了一个“五突击”的说法：一是突击落后、赶先进；如某一个单位或某一项工作落后了，就需要突击一下，赶上先进。二是突击困难、冲开路；如某一项工作无经验，有困难，就需要突击一下，突破一点，做出样子，取得经验，鼓舞信心，冲开一条道路，带动全盘。三是突击时间、抓季节；如时间紧迫，时机不能错过，就需要突击一下，以掌握时机，不违农时。四是突击开头、转经常；如一件新的工作，大家还不熟悉，还不习惯，就要突击一下，造成声势，作一个良好的开端并打下一个基础，以便真正能经常坚持下去。五是突击完成、赶任务；如一项工作任务已经接近完成，预定的期限也快到了，就需要突击一下，一鼓作气，把任务全部完成。
    这样说来，问题就清楚了：突击的作用、突击的条件、在什么情况下需要突击、如何运用突击、突击活动和全面工作的关系、突击活动和经常工作的关系……等等，都有了正确答案了。这样说来，也就既不是笼统地简单化地强调突击，又不是笼统地简单化地反对突击，而是细致地分析了突击，因此对突击给予了一个恰如其分的评价。这样肯定突击的作用，是有说服力；这样反驳否定突击的论点，也是有说服力的。
    今天的农民，大概多数人还没有来得及去研究哲学，对于辩证法的原理，也未必就能熟知，但他们这个“五突击”的说法，却如此符合农业生产的客观规律，是一种辩证的观点。
    那末，这件事恰好告诉了我们认识的来源是实践，经过实践中多次的反复以后，人是能够达到对客观真理的认识的。当然，像农民这样的实践家，如果懂得哲学原理，除了对于生产将带来极大推动以外，他们对于客观真理的认识，对于科学和哲学的发展，将会带来多大的促进作用，怕是难以估计的了。
    而那些有“学问”的人，到实践中去充实自己，发展自己的认识，也是迫不及待的了。他们也能谈些关于突击好、坏的空论，但是远不如“五突击”说的深刻和具体，也正是说明的这一点。
