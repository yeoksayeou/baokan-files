Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Comrade Chen Boda delivered a speech entitled "Continue to Transform Peking University with the Critical Revolutionary Spirit of Marxism-Leninism and Build a New Communist Peking University" to 10,000 teachers, students and staff at Peking University's 60th anniversary celebration today.

Peking University is the largest comprehensive university in our country. It currently has fourteen departments, thirty-seven specialties, and ten thousand teachers, students, and staff. In the past sixty years, it has always been permeated by the struggle between two roads: the new and the old, progress and reaction, revolution and counter-revolution. Currently, under the slogan of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, and conscious revolution, the ideological remolding movement of all teachers and students is in full swing.

The anniversary celebration was held this afternoon. In addition to the 10,000 teachers, students, and staff of the entire school, Peng Zhen, Guo Moruo, Chen Boda, Yang Xiufeng, and other figures from academic circles were invited to attend the conference.

After President Ma Yinchu delivered the opening speech, Comrade Chen Boda was invited to speak. Chen Boda said: During the May Fourth Movement, Peking University stood at the forefront of the movement, with a critical revolutionary spirit. At that time, the central slogan was to oppose imperialism and overthrow the Confucian shop. Later, bourgeois rightists represented by Hu Shi seized the leadership of Peking University and changed the direction of teaching at Peking University. Now we must continue to inherit the tradition of the May Fourth Movement. However, our current critical revolutionary spirit is based on a completely new foundation, on the foundation of the victory of the socialist system, and is a critical revolutionary spirit guided by Marxism-Leninism. Since liberation, after the intellectual remolding movement, especially after last year's rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, Peking University has basically changed its face and began to show a new Marxist critical revolutionary style. However, this critical revolutionary spirit is still far from enough. Compared with the socialist revolutionary spirit of the working class and peasants, and compared with the great leap forward in production and construction of workers and peasants, the critical revolutionary atmosphere in the national academic circles is still backward. In my opinion, Peking University is also still backward. This is manifested in the fact that mutual criticism and self-criticism in academic circles are still far from adequate. It is inconceivable that people who have systematically formed a set of bourgeois philosophical viewpoints before liberation can obtain proletarian consciousness without profound criticism, or without further profound and systematic self-criticism. It is not easy for old intellectuals to finally abandon bourgeois consciousness and acquire proletarian consciousness, which requires a long process of profound criticism and self-criticism.

Chen Boda said: The old professors of Peking University generally have two burdens: one is being educated in the decadent period of Western capitalism, and the other is being influenced by Chinese feudal consciousness. This is the case in philosophy, political economy, history, literature, and other fields. We must use the critical revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism to treat the legacy of old Chinese society, look forward rather than backward, that is, do not value the past over the present, but value the present over the past.

Chen Boda said: We are very fortunate to live in the great era of revolutionary transformation of the world proletariat, in the great era of the decline of imperialism and the prosperity of socialism, and in the era of the great leap forward that China has not had for thousands of years. The people demand that countless talented intellectuals serve them wholeheartedly, and demand that all aspects of the academic community be able to fully express their thoughts and will. We have the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought, and the encouragement of the broad masses of working people. I think the people's demand will definitely be achieved. In order to realize this demand of the people, on the 60th anniversary of Peking University, I would like to put forward the following suggestion to everyone: "Continue to transform Peking University with the critical revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism and build a new Communist Peking University."

Chen Boda ended his speech with the slogan "Long live the new Communist Peking University."

Comrade Peng Zhen also spoke at the meeting. He said: I hope Peking University will become a university that is both red and expert, and a communist university. I wish the teachers, staff and students of Peking University to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, establish the proletarian ideology and worldview, combine the life of teachers and students with the workers and peasants, combine it with the practice of socialist revolution and construction, and serve the 600 million people wholeheartedly, and serve socialism. This is the hope of the 600 million people for Peking University, and it is also the task and obligation of all teachers and students of Peking University.

Following him was Yang Xiufeng, Minister of Education, who spoke. Yang Xiufeng said that at present, there is a great leap forward on all fronts in the country, but the problem of which road to take - socialist education or bourgeois education - and which method to use in universities and colleges has not been finally resolved. The problems revealed in Peking University's rectification campaign have fully illustrated this point. Some people do not recognize the direction of education serving politics and serving production, and thus there have been bourgeois educational and academic ideas such as being divorced from politics, divorced from reality, neglecting practice, valuing the past over the present, and even praising the past and negating the present, which has seriously affected the implementation of the socialist educational policy. Yang Xiufeng pointed out that in order to run socialist universities well, it is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party, consolidate the leading position of Marxism-Leninism, implement the class line of training working-class intellectuals, and implement the policy of combining education with productive labor and linking theory with practice, so as to better train laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and good health for the country.

Alumni representatives Xu Deheng, professor representative Zhang Jingyue, and student representative Pang Chunlan spoke afterwards.

Xu Deheng said: The alma mater before liberation was a capitalist university, serving the ruling class. In the nine years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party and the government, the alma mater has embarked on the socialist road. The scale of the alma mater, the number of teachers and students, the number of graduates and the quality have been greatly developed and improved compared with before liberation, and the alumni are very happy about these achievements.

Professor Zhang Jingyue, after explaining that intellectuals must carry out ideological remolding in order to achieve the leap forward to being both red and expert, expressed his intention to always follow the Communist Party, closely unite around the Party, better carry out self-remolding, and temper himself into a working-class intellectual.

Pang Chunlan, vice chairman of the student union, said on behalf of all the students at the meeting that they would study hard and work hard to become socialist laborers who are both red and expert.

Representatives of foreign students studying at Peking University presented banners, flowers and other gifts to the school at the meeting. The conference read out congratulatory messages from Moscow University, Rostov-on-Don University, Lviv Polytechnic Institute, Berlin Humboldt University, the Oriental Institute of Berlin Humboldt University, and Kim Il-sung University. The conference also received congratulatory letters and commemorative gifts from many universities in China.

Today, the alumni of Peking University gathered together. Among them were old alumni with white hair from the era of the Imperial University of Peking, as well as new alumni who had just left school not long ago and are now working in various revolutionary posts. Accompanied by the faculty and students at the school, they visited the school history museum and laboratories, and reminisced about the past of Peking University. In the evening, the students held bonfires and artistic performances to celebrate the 39th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the anniversary of the school.

    陈伯达同志在北大六十周年纪念会上讲话
    建设共产主义的新北大
    老教授必须丢掉两个包袱：一是受西方资本主义没落时期的教育；一是受中国封建意识的影响
    新华社4日讯　“用马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的精神继续改造北京大学，建设一个共产主义的新北京大学”，陈伯达同志今天以此为题，在北京大学六十周年校庆纪念会上对全校万名师生员工作了演说。
    北京大学是我国最大的一个综合性大学。现在有十四个系，三十七个专业，一万名师生员工。在以往的六十年中，它始终贯穿着新与旧、进步与反动、革命与反革命这样两条道路的斗争。目前在兴无灭资、自觉革命的口号下，全校师生的思想改造运动正在轰轰烈烈地进行。
    校庆纪念大会是在今天下午举行的。参加大会的除全校万名师生员工外，彭真、郭沫若、陈伯达、杨秀峰及其他学术界人士等应邀参加了大会。
    校长马寅初致开幕词后，陈伯达同志被请讲话。陈伯达说：在“五四”运动中，北京大学曾经站在运动的前面，有批判的革命的精神，当时中心的口号是反对帝国主义，打倒孔家店。后来以胡适为代表的资产阶级右派篡夺了北大的领导权，改变了北大的教学方向。现在我们要继续继承“五四”的传统。但是，我们现在的批判的革命的精神，是在一种完全新的基础上，在社会主义制度已经取得胜利的基础上，是以马克思列宁主义的思想为指导的批判的革命精神。在解放以后，经过知识分子改造运动，特别是经过去年整风运动和反右派斗争，北大已经基本上改变了面貌，开始出现了马克思主义的批判的革命新风格。但是，这种批判的革命的精神还是很不够的。同工人阶级和农民的社会主义革命精神比较，同工人、农民的生产、建设的大跃进比较，全国学术界的批判的革命的风气还是落后的，在我看来，北大也同样还是落后的。这表现在：学术上的互相批判和自我批判得还很不够。不可设想，对于解放前已经有系统地形成一套资产阶级哲学观点的人不进行深刻的批判，或者他们没有进一步进行深刻的系统的自我批判，就能够获得无产阶级的意识。旧知识分子要最后抛弃资产阶级的意识，而获得无产阶级的意识，并不是件很容易的事，这需要经过一个长期的深刻的批判与自我批判的过程。
    陈伯达说：北京大学的老教授大体上有两个包袱：一是受西方资本主义没落时期的教育，一是受中国封建意识的影响。不论在哲学、政治经济学、历史学、文学等方面都是这样。我们要用马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的精神来对待中国旧社会的遗产，要向前看而不要向后看，即不要厚古薄今，而是要厚今薄古。
    陈伯达说：我们很幸福地生活在世界无产阶级革命大变革的伟大时代，生活在帝国主义没落和社会主义兴旺的伟大时代，生活在中国数千年来没有过的大跃进的时代。人民要求有无数多才多艺的知识分子全心全意地来为他们服务，要求学术界一切方面能够充分表达他们的思想和意志。我们有中国共产党的领导，有毛泽东同志思想的领导，有广大劳动人民群众的鞭策，我想，人民这种要求一定能够达到的。为着实现人民这种要求，在北大六十周年的纪念日里，我愿意向大家提出这样的意见：“用马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的精神继续改造北京大学，建设一个共产主义的新北京大学。”
    陈伯达用“共产主义的新北京大学万岁”的口号结束了他的讲话。
    彭真同志也在会上讲了话，他说：我希望北京大学成为红透专深的大学，成为共产主义的大学。祝北京大学的教师、职员和同学们，坚决地彻底地破除资产阶级思想，建立无产阶级的思想和宇宙观，把教职员和学生的生活同工农群众相结合，同社会主义革命和建设的实践相结合，全心全意地为六万万人民服务，为社会主义服务。这是六万万人民对北京大学的希望，也是北京大学全体师生的任务和义务。
    接着讲话的还有教育部部长杨秀峰。杨秀峰说，目前国内各个战线上都在大跃进，但高等学校中社会主义教育和资产阶级教育这两条道路、两种方法问题还没有最后解决，北京大学在整风中所揭发的问题已充分地说明了这一点。有些人不认识教育为政治服务、为生产服务的方向，因而出现了脱离政治、脱离实际、轻视实践、厚古薄今、甚至颂古非今等等资产阶级的教育思想和学术思想，这样就严重地影响了社会主义办学方针的贯彻。杨秀峰指出：为了办好社会主义大学，必须加强党的领导，巩固马列主义思想的领导地位；必须贯彻培养工人阶级知识分子的阶级路线；必须贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合、理论和实践相联系的方针，以便更好地为国家培养出有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的、身体健康的劳动者。
    校友代表许德珩、教授代表张景钺、学生代表庞春兰等随后分别讲话。
    许德珩说：解放前的母校是一所资本主义性质的大学，它是为统治阶级服务的。解放九年来，母校在党和政府的领导下，走上了社会主义的道路。母校的规模、师生人数、毕业生人数和质量都比解放前有了很大发展和提高，校友们对这些成就感到十分高兴。
    张景钺教授在说明知识分子必须进行思想改造才能向红专跃进的情况后，表示要永远跟着共产党走，紧密地团结在党的周围，更好地进行自我改造，把自己锻炼成为工人阶级的知识分子。
    学生会副主席庞春兰代表全体学生在会上表示，他们要努力学习，刻苦锻炼，使自己成为又红又专的社会主义劳动者。
    在北京大学学习的各国留学生代表在大会上向学校赠献了锦旗、鲜花等礼物。大会宣读了来自莫斯科大学、罗斯多夫·顿大学、里沃夫工学院、柏林洪堡大学、柏林洪堡大学东方学院、金日成综合大学的贺电。大会还接到国内许多大学的贺信和纪念礼物。
    今天，北京大学的校友们济济一堂，他们当中有京师大学堂时代的须发苍白的老校友，也有不久前才离开学校现在在各种革命岗位上工作的新校友。他们在在校的师生们陪伴下参观了校史馆、实验室，并追忆了北大的往事。入晚，学生们举行了营火晚会和文艺演出，庆祝“五四”三十九周年和校庆纪念日。
