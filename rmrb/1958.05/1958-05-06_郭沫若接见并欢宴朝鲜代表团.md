Xinhua News Agency, May 5th—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, hosted a grand banquet tonight to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China, headed by Xu Zhengye, deputy head Kim Cheon-hae, and all members of the delegation.

	Guo Moruo spoke at the banquet, extending a warm welcome to the delegation on behalf of the China Peace Committee and the Chinese people, and expressing heartfelt thanks for bringing the profound friendship of the Korean people to the Chinese people.

	Guo Moruo said that the friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is an unbreakable, eternal friendship forged in blood. The Chinese people's struggles against imperialism have always received active support from the Korean people. The Korean War, in which the Chinese and Korean people fought side by side against American imperialist aggression, not only defended Korea's national independence but also guaranteed China's security and the Chinese people's peaceful construction endeavors. The Chinese people will never forget this noble internationalist spirit and the brotherly affection of the Korean people for the Chinese people.

	Guo Moruo said: The peace-loving Korean people's struggle to achieve peaceful reunification of their motherland has won the active support of the Chinese people and all peace-loving people in the world. However, the territory and people of Korea are still artificially divided into two parts. This abnormal situation is not only intolerable to the Korean people but also to all peace-loving countries and people in the world. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, and with the support of all peace-loving people in the world, the Korean people's just struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely be victorious.

	Head of the delegation, Xu Zhengye, then spoke. She once again expressed her deep gratitude to the Chinese people for fostering Korean war orphans. She said that thanks to the warm care of the brotherly Chinese people and the selfless efforts of outstanding Chinese medical workers, many orphans have gone from being weak to well-developed. Among the orphans who have finished their studies and returned home, some are developing into excellent technicians and skilled workers of the Republic. Soon, they will all return home and become outstanding socialist builders of the motherland in their respective positions. She said: The entire Korean people will never forget this deep friendship between the Korean and Chinese people for all time, and will pass it on to future generations.

	Xu Zhengye said: Due to the aggressive schemes of American imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, Korea has still not been unified. In order to realize the Korean people's desire for the reunification of their motherland, the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government have put forward a series of reasonable proposals. In its statement of February 5, 1958, the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a series of reasonable proposals for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea. The government of the People's Republic of China has actively supported this proposal of our government, and the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided to completely withdraw from Korea by the end of 1958 and are carrying out this work. This will make a significant contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue and the easing of tensions in the Far East, and will once again powerfully confirm the peaceful policies of the Korean and Chinese governments.

	Xu Zhengye said: American imperialism not only fails to take any measures to withdraw its troops from South Korea but also plots to continue to keep American troops stationed in South Korea, stubbornly pursues a policy of aggression, transports new weapons such as atomic weapons into South Korea, and frantically intensifies the tense situation in Korea. However, no matter how American imperialism struggles, it cannot stop the Korean people's peaceful reunification.

	Also present at the banquet tonight were Vice Premier of the State Council He Long, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Li Jishen, Deputy Chairmen of the CPPCC Chen Shutong and Liao Chengzhi, Minister of Internal Affairs Xie Juezai, Minister of Justice Shi Liang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zeng Yongquan, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Gan Siqi, and others. The Korean Ambassador to China, Li Yong-ho, was also invited to attend the banquet.

	A reception was held before the banquet.

Xinhua News Agency, May 5th—Guo Moruo, Chairman of the China Peace Committee, received Xu Zhengye, head of the Korean People's Delegation to China, Kim Cheon-hae, deputy head, and all members of the delegation this morning.

    郭沫若接见并欢宴朝鲜代表团
    据新华社5日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若今晚举行盛大宴会，欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团团长许贞琡、副团长金天海和代表团全体人员。
    郭沫若在宴会上讲话，代表中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民，向代表团表示热烈的欢迎，并且衷心地感谢他们给中国人民带来了朝鲜人民的深厚友谊。
    郭沫若说，中朝两国人民的友谊，是用鲜血凝结成的、牢不可破的永恒的友谊。中国人民历次的反帝斗争，都得到了朝鲜人民的积极支援。中朝两国人民并肩反抗美帝国主义侵略的朝鲜战争，不仅保卫了朝鲜的国家独立，而且也保证了中国的安全和中国人民的和平建设事业。朝鲜人民的这种崇高的国际主义精神和对中国人民的手足情谊，我们中国人民是永远不能忘记的。
    郭沫若说：热爱和平的朝鲜人民为争取祖国和平统一所作的斗争，获得了中国人民和全世界一切爱好和平的人民的积极支持。但是，朝鲜的国土和人民至今还被人为地分割成为南北两部。这种不正常的局面，不仅是朝鲜人民所不能容忍的，同时也是全世界爱好和平的国家和人民所不能容忍的。我们坚决地相信：在朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府的领导下，在全世界爱好和平的人民的支持下，朝鲜人民为和平统
  一祖国而进行的正义斗争，是一定会获得胜利的。
    许贞琡团长接着讲话。她再一次对中国人民抚育朝鲜战灾孤儿表示深切谢意。她说，由于兄弟的中国人民的温暖照顾和中国优秀医务工作者的忘我努力，使得许多孤儿由虚弱变成了发育健全。在已经结束学院生活而归国的孤儿当中，有的正在发展成为共和国优秀的技术人员和技术工人。不久以后，他们就要全部归国，并将在各自的岗位上，成为祖国优秀的社会主义建设者。她说：全体朝鲜人民万古千秋永远不会忘记朝中两国人民的这种深情厚谊，并且将子孙万代地传续下去。
    许贞琡说：由于美帝国主义和李承晚匪帮的侵略阴谋，朝鲜仍然没有得到统一。为了实现朝鲜人民统一祖国的愿望，朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府曾经提出过一连串的合理方案。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在1958年2月5日的声明中，提出了一切外国军队立即撤出南北朝鲜和实现朝鲜和平统一的一系列合理方案。中华人民共和国政府积极支持了我国政府的这一建议，而中国人民志愿军则决定在1958年底以前完全撤出朝鲜，并且正在进行这一工作。这将对和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势作出重大的贡献，并且再一次有力地证实了朝中两国政府的和平政策。
    许贞琡说：美帝国主义不但不采取任何措施把自己的军队撤出南朝鲜，反而阴谋继续把美国军队留驻南朝鲜，一意奉行侵略政策，把原子武器等新式武器运入南朝鲜，疯狂地加剧朝鲜的紧张局势。但是，不管美帝国主义怎样挣扎，也不可能阻挡朝鲜人民的和平统一。
    出席今晚宴会的，有国务院副总理贺龙，人大常委会副委员长李济深，和大副主席陈叔通、廖承志，内务部部长谢觉哉，司法部部长史良，外交部副部长曾涌泉，中国人民解放军总政治部副主任甘泗淇等。朝鲜驻中国大使李永镐也应邀出席了宴会。
    在宴会以前举行了酒会。
    据新华社5日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会主席郭沫若在今天上午接见了朝鲜人民访华代表团团长许贞琡、副团长金天海和代表团全体团员。
