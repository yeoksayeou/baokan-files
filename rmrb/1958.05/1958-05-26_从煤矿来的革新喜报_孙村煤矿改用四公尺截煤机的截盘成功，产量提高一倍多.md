Innovation Good News from the Coal Mine
    Suncun Coal Mine's Successful Modification of the Coal Cutting Machine to a Four-Meter Cutterhead More Than Doubles Production

To the Editorial Department of the People's Daily:

The entire workforce of the Suncun Coal Mine in Shandong, under our bureau, has enhanced its political awareness and liberated its thinking through the rectification and anti-rightist movement. In the upsurge of exerting utmost effort, aiming high, learning from advanced examples, catching up with the advanced, and launching technical innovation movements, after studying the advanced experience of the Jiawang Taozhuang brother bureau mines in lengthening the cutterhead of the coal cutting machine, in addition to extending the original Soviet-style coal cutting machine's 1.8-meter cutterhead to 2.4 meters, we also experimented with extending the cutterhead to 4 meters. The trial use of the four-meter cutterhead underground on May 24 went well. The original output per cycle on the working face was 457 tons; now the output per cycle is 985 tons, an increase of 528 tons, raising production efficiency by 115%. We are specially reporting this good news of the successful technical innovation experiment to you. We are organizing all mines to learn and promote this experience, improve the efficiency of coal cutting machines, and strive to catch up with the advanced indicators of the Shuangyashan Mining Bureau.

    从煤矿来的革新喜报
    孙村煤矿改用四公尺截煤机的截盘成功，产量提高一倍多人民日报编辑部：
    我局所属山东孙村煤矿的全体职工，通过了整风双反运动提高了政治觉悟，解放了思想，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、学先进、赶先进、开展技术革新运动中，学习了贾汪陶庄兄弟局矿加长截煤机截盘的先进经验之后，除将原苏式截煤机一点八公尺截盘加长至二点四公尺使用外，并试验将截盘加长至四公尺。5月24日四公尺截盘在井下试用情况良好，工作面产量原每循环四百五十七吨，现每个循环产量九百八十五吨，增加五百二十八吨，提高生产效率115％，特将这一技术革新试验成功的消息向你们报喜。我们正在组织各矿学习推行这一经验，提高截煤机效能，为赶上双鸭矿务局的先进指标而努力。新汶矿务局
