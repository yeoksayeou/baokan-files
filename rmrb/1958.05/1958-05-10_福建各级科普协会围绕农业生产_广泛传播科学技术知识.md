Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 9th: Science and Technology Popularization Associations at all levels in Fujian Province are widely disseminating scientific and technological knowledge to the masses, centering on agricultural production and the technical innovation movement.

In the southern Fujian region where early rice has been transplanted, close planting techniques have been widely promoted during the transplanting process. In this region, whether or not the seedlings can be guaranteed not to lodge is now a crucial factor for increasing production. Science and technology popularization organizations in various localities have promptly used agricultural cooperative technical evening schools, lecture stations, big-character posters, and in-depth explanations in the fields to publicize scientific knowledge and specific methods for preventing lodging of early rice, such as rational fertilization and rational irrigation. This has not only dispelled the concerns of some people that lodging would affect production increases but also provided effective solutions to the masses.

In the Minjiang River basin, which is in the busy season of rice transplanting, local science and technology popularization organizations are conducting publicity centered on the promotion of technical knowledge such as close planting of early rice, helping cooperatives solve various technical difficulties in the promotion of close planting. When promoting close planting of early rice in Shati Township, Minhou County, there was a shortage of "close planting method" transplanting experts. If this problem were not solved, it would delay the agricultural season by more than twenty days, seriously affecting the increase in early rice production. The township's science and technology popularization member group immediately explained close planting transplanting techniques in the agricultural cooperative's technical evening school and conducted on-site practical instruction in the fields. Within eight days, they trained 220 skilled "close planting method" transplanters, enabling the township to complete the task of close planting transplanting in a timely manner before the Beginning of Summer.

    福建各级科普协会围绕农业生产
    广泛传播科学技术知识
    据新华社福州9日电　福建省各级科学技术普及协会正围绕农业生产和技术革新运动，广泛地向群众传播科学技术知识。
    早稻已插完秧的闽南地区，插秧中普遍推广了密植技术。在这个地区，目前能否保证禾苗不倒伏，就成为增产的重要一环。各地科学技术普及组织便及早通过农业社技术夜校、讲演站、大字报和深入田头讲解等形式，向农民宣传合理施肥和合理灌溉等防止早稻倒伏的科学知识和具体作法，既解除了一些群众怕倒伏影响增产的顾虑，也给群众提出了有效的解决办法。
    正在插秧大忙季节的闽江流域，各地科普组织便围绕推广早稻密植等技术知识进行宣传，帮助合作社解决推广密植中的各项技术困难。闽侯县沙堤乡在推广早稻密植时缺乏“密植法”插秧手，如果不解决这个问题，就要耽误农事季节二十多天，严重影响早稻增产。这个乡科普会员小组立即在农业社技术夜校里讲解密植插秧技术和进行田头实地传授，八天内训练出“密植法”插秧能手二百二十人，使全乡在立夏前就适时完成密植插秧的任务。
