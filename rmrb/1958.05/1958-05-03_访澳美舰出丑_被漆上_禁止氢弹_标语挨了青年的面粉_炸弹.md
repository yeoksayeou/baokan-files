Xinhua News Agency, Sydney, 2nd: On the evening of April 30th, students from the University of Queensland painted the slogan "Ban Hydrogen Bombs" in large characters on the hull of the visiting American destroyer "Radford." At the same time, other students threw flour-filled "bombs" at the destroyer as it passed over the Story Bridge en route to its mooring. Upon discovering the slogan, the ship's personnel immediately divided into teams to scrub it off, but it appears that the hull will need to be repainted to completely remove the slogan.

    访澳美舰出丑
    被漆上“禁止氢弹”标语挨了青年的面粉“炸弹”
    新华社2日讯　悉尼消息：4月30日晚，昆士兰大学学生在前来访问的美国驱逐舰“雷德福号”舰身上用大号字漆写一句“禁止氢弹”标语。同时，其他学生在这艘驱逐舰经过斯托里桥前往停泊地的时候向它投掷用面粉捏成的“炸弹”。舰上的人员在发现标语后立即分队擦洗标语，但是看来必须将船身重新漆一遍才能把标语完全擦掉。
