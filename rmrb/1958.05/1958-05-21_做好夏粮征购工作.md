Do a Good Job of Summer Grain Procurement

The winter wheat this year has grown well. Although there are still late-stage diseases that need attention, the bumper wheat harvest is in sight, with a much larger increase in production than last year, which is almost a foregone conclusion. Our country's harvest season starts with wheat in May and June and extends continuously to November. We have a relatively long period of continuous harvesting, so we can withstand some disasters in agriculture without being too greatly affected. This is a characteristic and an advantage of our country. Since our country implemented the unified allocation and adjustment of grain on a national scale, this characteristic has become even more obvious, and whether the summer crops are bountiful and how much summer grain the state has in its grasp and how timely it is, has become even more significant.

Although last year's grain output increased somewhat compared to the previous year, the increase was not large. Some areas suffered from more severe natural disasters, and there were still some shortcomings in the work in some areas. The grain reserves and supply were unbalanced. Therefore, the state's grain reserves did not increase significantly in the past year. However, due to the increased labor intensity in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, the amount of grain consumed by farmers cannot but increase. In order to meet this need, and at the same time, to help areas with early harvests support areas with late harvests, to use surplus to make up for deficiencies, the state needs to have a bit more grain in its grasp during the harvest season and in areas with good harvests.

The reasonable allocation of procurement tasks has always been the basis for doing a good job in grain work. The principle of allocation should be based on specific circumstances, taking care of both the state and the farmers, both the present and the future. After the rationally allocated tasks are assigned to the provinces, they must finally be assigned to the agricultural cooperatives and meet with the masses, so that the problems in the task allocation can be determined. On this point, it is absolutely not permissible to think that less or no management is required simply because the "contracting" of grain to the cooperatives has been implemented. The amount of summer grain procured affects both the amount of rations for farmers and the proportion of summer grain to autumn grain and the proportion of coarse grains to fine grains in the total grain income of agricultural cooperatives and farmers throughout the year. And the distribution within the agricultural cooperative, between the cooperative and its members, and between the members themselves, also requires the active help and guidance of the state. Therefore, the state's procurement must be closely integrated with the internal distribution of the agricultural cooperative, and the summer procurement must be unified with the annual procurement.

Since wheat is a connecting ration and a fine grain, its consumption generally does not account for a large proportion of farmers' total grain consumption. Therefore, in addition to retaining the necessary seeds, agricultural cooperatives should generally calculate the amount of rations needed for farmers to connect to the new autumn grain according to the population size. For the remaining grain, the state should appropriately purchase more. Of course, it is also necessary to appropriately leave the agricultural cooperative with more wheat than is necessary for consumption, so that the agricultural cooperative has some reserves and the grain consumption of farmers is improved.

The wheat harvest season is a busy and hectic time in the countryside. With the demands of the Great Leap Forward in production, labor and time are even more precious during this season. The rural work at this time must be under the unified leadership of the Party, with agricultural production as the center, considering the overall situation and making unified arrangements. Neither should the summer procurement and grain storage hinder production, nor should we only care about field production and abandon the summer procurement and grain storage. Learning from the lessons of heavy rains during the wheat harvest season in some places in previous years, the harvest and storage of summer grain this year will be more concentrated and more urgent than in previous years. Therefore, full preparations must be made in advance.

In order to ensure that farmers can deliver good grain to the state, personnel engaged in grain procurement should go to the countryside in advance to specifically help agricultural cooperatives carry out the work of drying, winnowing, and sorting grain. At the same time, a price negotiation committee with the participation of farmer representatives should be established to negotiate fair and reasonable prices in different grades, so that neither the state nor the agricultural cooperative suffers. It is also necessary to help agricultural cooperatives organize labor and prepare grain transportation tools. In order to rationally arrange and save labor, every effort should be made to achieve one-time storage or one-time loading at the station when sending grain to the warehouse, so as to facilitate storage and transportation.

After seed selection, good seeds used to meet the sales quota or good seeds specially contracted for sale should be properly arranged. The grain exchanged between farmers and the state or the revolving grain sold to the state should also be properly handled and arranged separately.

Grain procurement is a major event involving the relationship between the state and the people. It also affects the relationship between agricultural cooperatives and their members, and between the members themselves. It affects both production and consumption, and consumption and accumulation. Therefore, grain procurement is not a simple technical task. There are many policy issues that need to be considered, and there has always been a struggle between two lines. One line is to relax political and ideological work, simply raise the retention standards or increase the grain supply quotas, and try to solve the grain problem in this way. The result is often that the state collects less or sells more grain, and the grain problem becomes even more tense. The other line is to strengthen political and ideological work, guide the broad masses of farmers to consider the overall grain situation from the perspective of masters, consider the needs of both the state and the local people, so as to take care of both the state and the local people, meet consumption needs, and appropriately accumulate and adjust to meet the needs of the entire socialist construction cause. The result of implementing this line is that the grain situation is eased and stabilized. In the future, we must adhere to this correct line. In order to implement this line, all staff must go deep into the masses, repeatedly publicize, and at the same time educate farmers to be diligent and thrifty in managing their households, plan their grain consumption, and use it sparingly. Our work must be done in such a way that it can both promote the Great Leap Forward in production and foster a habit of saving grain.

During the summer grain harvest and procurement period, the State Council's regulations on closing grain markets must continue to be implemented, and all illegal grain business activities must be strictly prohibited.

At present, the summer grain is abundant, the people's socialist consciousness has been greatly improved, and the state does not increase the annual grain procurement tasks. Under such favorable conditions, as long as we can correctly use the existing advanced experience, pay attention to the implementation of policies, and strengthen political and ideological work, this year's grain procurement work will definitely be done better.

### 做好夏粮征购工作

    做好夏粮征购工作
    今年冬种小麦生长良好，虽然还有晚期的病害需要注意，但是小麦丰收在望，比去年增产很多，差不多是已经定局了。我国的收获季节是从五、六月的小麦开始，一直延长到十一月不断。我们有较长时期的连续收获，所以就能够在农业上经受得起若干灾害而不至于受太大的影响。这是我国的特点，也是优点。自从我国在全国范围内实行粮食的统一调配调剂以来，这个特点就看得更加明显了，而夏季作物丰收与否，国家所掌握的夏粮多少和及时与否，也就有了更明显的意义。
    上年度粮食的产量虽然比前年有所增加，但增加不多。有些地方有较重的自然灾害，有些地方工作上还有若干缺点，粮食的留量和供应量是不平衡的。所以国家的粮食库存在过去一年中并没有很大的增加。但是，由于农业生产大跃进中劳动强度的增加，农民的吃粮不能不有所增加。为了满足这种需要，同时为了地区间以早济晚，以有余补不足，为了以丰补歉，国家就需要在丰收的季节和丰收的地区多掌握一点粮食。
    征购任务分配合理，一向是做好粮食工作的基础。分配的原则，应该是根据具体情况，既照顾国家，又照顾农民，既照顾现在，又照顾将来。各省合理分配的任务下达之后，最后要分配到农业社，和群众见了面，才能确知任务分配中的问题。在这一点上，切不可因为实行了粮食“包干”到社就认为可以少管或不管了。夏征粮食的多少，既影响到农民的口粮数量，又影响到农业社和农民全年所得粮食的夏秋比重和粗细比重。而农业社内部社与社员、社员与社员之间的分配，也需要国家的积极帮助和指导。所以国家的征购必须同农业社内部的分配紧密结合，夏季的征购必须同全年的征购统一安排。
    由于小麦是接口粮，又是细粮，其消费量在农民的全部粮食消费中比重一般并不很大。所以农业社除了留足所必需的种籽之外，一般应当按人口大小计算，留出农民接上新秋粮所必需的口粮。其余的粮食，国家应该适当地多购一些。当然，也需要适当地给农业社留出比必要消费量多一些的小麦，使农业社有所储备，使农民的粮食消费情况有所改善。
    小麦收获季节，在农村中是紧张繁忙的。加上生产大跃进的要求，劳力和时间在这个季节就更加宝贵。这个时间的农村工作，必须在党的统一领导下，以农业生产为中心，全盘考虑，统一安排。既不能因夏征和粮食入仓妨害生产，也不可只顾田间生产而放弃夏征和粮食入库。接受往年有的地方麦收季节有大霖雨的教训，今年夏粮的收获和入仓将比往年更加集中，更加需要突击。所以必须事前充分准备。
    为了保证农民能够向国家交好粮，从事粮食征购工作的人员应当提前下乡，具体地帮助农业社开展晒干扬净、整理粮食的工作。同时，要成立有农民代表参加的议价委员会，分等议定公平合理的价格，使国家和农业社都不吃亏。还要帮助农业社组织劳动力，准备送粮工具。为了合理安排，节省劳力，在送粮入库时应尽可能争取一次入仓，或一次上车站，以便利保管和调运。
    在经过了选种之后，抵交售任务的优良种籽或特约交售的优良种籽，都应当作适当安排。对农民与国家之间品种交换的粮食或向国家出售的周转粮，也要适当处理，分别安排。
    征购粮食是牵涉到国家与人民间的关系的大事。同时也影响着农业社与社员、社员与社员之间的关系。它既影响到生产与消费，又影响消费与积累。所以粮食征购工作并不是一项简单的技术工作。这里面有许多政策问题需要考虑，同时也一直存在着两条路线的斗争。一条是放松政治思想工作，单纯提高留量标准或者增加粮食供应指标，想以此解决粮食问题，其结果往往是国家少收或者多销了粮食，粮食问题反而更加紧张。另一条路线是加强政治思想工作，引导广大农民以主人翁的态度考虑全盘粮食状况，考虑国家和当地人民两方面的需要，从而做到既照顾国家，又照顾当地人民，既能满足消费，又能适当积累和调剂，以适应整个社会主义建设事业的需要。实行这一路线的结果，是粮食局势缓和稳定。今后我们必须坚持这一正确的路线。为实行这一路线，所有的工作人员必须深入群众，反复宣传，同时要教育农民勤俭持家，计划用粮，细水长流。我们的工作必须做到一方面能促进生产大跃进，一方面养成节约用粮的风气。
    在夏粮收获和征购期间，必须继续执行国务院关闭粮食市场的规定，并严禁一切违法经营粮食的活动。
    目前夏粮丰收，人民社会主义觉悟已大大提高，而国家又不增加全年粮食征购任务，在这样有利的条件下，只要能够正确地运用已有的先进经验，注意执行政策和加强政治思想工作，今年的粮食征购工作就一定能够做得更好。
