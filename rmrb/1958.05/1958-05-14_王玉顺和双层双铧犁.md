　　Wang Yushun and the Double-Layer Moldboard Plow
　　By our reporter Zhu Cheng

　　"What kind of plow can plow deep and save effort?" Two months ago, Wang Yushun, a blacksmith from the Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative in Zengfumiao Township, Changge County, Henan Province, was still racking his brains over this problem. Now, the problem has been solved; the double-layer moldboard plow he created has become an outstanding exhibit at the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition.

　　The double-layer moldboard plow resembles an ordinary new-style walking plow, except that it has two plowshares with different heights of plow columns installed behind the guide wheel. When plowing, the front plow with the moldboard can plow six inches deep; the rear plow without the moldboard, on the basis of the six-inch depth plowed by the front plow, can further loosen the soil by plowing six inches deep. In summary, this plow has three advantages: it can plow six inches deeper than an ordinary walking plow; secondly, the front and rear plows have a clear division of labor, and although the plowing is deep, it will not turn the surface soil to the bottom and the subsoil to the top, affecting crop growth, as is the case with ordinary plows when deep plowing; thirdly, using this plow saves one person and one draft animal compared to the "front plow and rear set" deep plowing method.

　　Wang Yushun also participated in the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition. When the reporter interviewed him, he talked about the process of creating the double-layer moldboard plow.

　　In January, the Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called for deep plowing of autumn land throughout the county. At that time, the Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative was in the midst of a high tide of water conservancy construction, and winter irrigation and fertilizer accumulation for wheat fields also took up a lot of people's time, and the cooperative was quite strained for labor and livestock. As a result, some of the deep plowing work fell on the shoulders of female cooperative members. The women were very enthusiastic, working until after twelve o'clock at night, and going back to the fields before dawn.

　　One day, Wang Yushun went outside the village to watch the plowing. At this time, the director of the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department and the Party Secretary, who were working in the cooperative, were also in the field. Someone said to him: "Old Wang, think of a way. Look how tired the women are, their backs and legs ache, and they can't even plow one tenth of an acre a day!" Wang Yushun thought for a while and said to them:

　　"Let's use the front plow and rear set method!" The front plow and rear set is a deep plowing method that requires two plows to plow one furrow, and each plow requires two draft animals and one person, which cannot alleviate the tension of labor and livestock. Therefore, the director of the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department said to Wang Yushun: "You are a blacksmith, consider making a plow that can plow deep and save manpower and livestock!"

　　All day long, Wang Yushun thought about the problem of making a plow while working. He thought: The front plow and rear set of two plows is that one plow plows deeper than the other, wouldn't it be the same to install two plowshares, one high and one low, on one plow? Whether two plowshares installed on one plow can save livestock power is another matter, but it can always save one person to hold the plow. He put forward his idea, and many people supported him. The director of the County Party Committee's Rural Work Department said: "Let's do it! If it doesn't work, we'll study it again!" He and the cooperative's carpenter quickly made a double-layer moldboard plow. The front plowshare was an eight-inch walking plowshare, and the rear one was a seven-inch walking plowshare. But the trial plowing failed, the front plow did not go deep enough into the soil, and plowed too shallow. After everyone's research, it was believed that the plow beam was only four feet long, which was too short. When the animal pulled it, the plow lifted up, affecting the depth of the plowshare in the soil. Based on this opinion, they made another one, increasing the plow beam to four feet nine inches. This time the plowshare went deep into the soil, but the moldboard of the rear plow turned up the raw soil. At that time, the moldboard of the rear plow was removed, leaving only the plow tip to loosen the soil. When checking the plowing depth, everyone found that because the rear plow column was not high enough, the rear plow went into the soil shallower, and the total plowing depth was only one foot, which was still short of the requirement of deep plowing one foot to one foot five inches. In this way, people made another request to Wang Yushun: Improve the plow again and strive to achieve a plowing depth of more than one foot.

　　At this time, Wang Yushun was in trouble. If the rear plow column was raised too high, the livestock would not be able to pull it, wouldn't it be a waste? More livestock would make the livestock power even more strained? What to do? In those days, he planned day and night, trying to find a win-win solution. Later, the solution was finally found: the rear plow column was changed to two sections, each section was screwed with some eyes, and screws were used to connect them. The height of the plow column could be adjusted, so that the problem was solved: if it was to be shallow, it could be as shallow as eight inches, and if it was to be deep, it could be as deep as one foot five inches.

　　When the cooperative used this plow to plow the land, it used strong livestock to pull it, and two of them could pull it. When doing set plowing, the rear plow was an old plow tip, with only a plow tip and no plow wings. One animal could not pull it, and two animals were too many; two plowshares installed on one plow, three animals to pull was just right.

　　Before creating the double-layer moldboard plow, in addition to working day and night to rush to make water conservancy tools and support water conservancy projects, Wang Yushun also created and improved thirteen kinds of agricultural tools. In addition to the plow, the five agricultural tools brought to the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition include a dual-purpose leveling rake, a dual-purpose shovel, a double-headed soil loosening three-tooth rake, a double-headed hollow hoe, and a furrowing plow for making ridges.

### 王玉顺和双层双铧犁

　　王玉顺和双层双铧犁
　　本报记者　朱成
    “有个什么样的犁才能耕得又深又省力呢？”两个多月以前，河南省长葛县增福庙乡先进第一农业社的铁匠王玉顺还为这个问题绞脑汁。现在，问题解决了；他创造的双层双铧犁已经成了全国农具展览会一件出色的展览品。
    双层双铧犁和普通的新式步犁相像，只是在导轮的后面安上两个犁柱高低不同的犁铧。耕地时，带有犁壁能够翻土的前犁能耕六寸深；没有犁壁不能翻土的后犁，在前犁耕过的六寸深的基础上，又可深耕六寸把土穿松。概括起来说，这种犁有三种好处：比一般步犁可深耕六寸；其次，前后犁有明确的分工，尽管耕的深，却不会像一般犁深耕时那样把地面熟土翻到地下，生土翻到上面，影响作物生长；第三是使用这种犁比“前犁后套”的深耕方法节省一个人和一头耕畜。
    王玉顺也参加了全国农具展览会。记者访问他的时候，他谈了创造双层双铧犁的经过。
    中共长葛县委在1月间号召在全县范围内深翻大秋地。那时候先进第一农业社正处在兴修水利高潮阶段，麦田冬灌和积肥也占去了很多人，社里劳力和畜力相当紧张。于是一部分深翻地的活计就落在了女社员肩上。妇女们热情很高，夜里干到十二点以后，天不亮又下地了。
    有一天，王玉顺走到村外去看翻地。这时候，在社里工作的县委农村工作部部长和党委书记等人也在地里，有人向他说：“老王，你想想办法吧。你看妇女太累了，累的腰酸腿痛，一人一天还翻不了一分地！”王玉顺想了想就向他们说：
  “采用前犁后套的办法吧！”前犁后套是一种深耕的办法，要用两副犁耕一个垅沟，每副犁都要用两头耕畜一个人，不能缓和劳、畜力的紧张状况。因此，县委农村工作部长便向王玉顺说：“你是个铁匠，考虑考虑造个什么犁才能耕的又深又省人力、畜力呢？”
    这一整天，王玉顺一边干活一边想着造犁的问题。他想：两副犁前犁后套是一犁比一犁耕的深，把两个犁铧一高一低安在一个犁上不也一样吗？两个犁铧安在一个犁上，能不能节省畜力先不管，但是，总能节省一个扶犁的人吧。他把他的想法提出来了，许多人都支持他。县委农村工作部长说：“干吧！不好使再研究！”他和社里的木匠很快造了一部双层双铧犁。前边的犁铧用的是八吋步犁的铧，后边是七吋步犁铧的。但是试耕时失败了，前铧入土不深，耕的太浅。经过大家研究，认为犁辕只有四尺长，太短，牲口一拉，犁就扬起来了，影响犁铧的入土深度。根据这种意见他们又造了一部，把犁辕加长到四尺九寸。这回犁铧入土深了，不过后犁的犁壁却把生土翻了上来。当时就把后犁犁壁卸下去，只留犁头松土。赶到检查耕深的时候，大家发现：因为后犁柱还不够高，后犁入土较浅，总耕深只有一尺，离深耕一尺以上到一尺五寸的要求还差。这样，人们又向王玉顺提出要求：再把犁改进一下，争取耕深达到一尺以上。
    这时候，王玉顺可犯了难，后犁柱加的太高，牲口少了拉不动，岂不是造出了废物？多套牲口，畜力不是更紧张？怎么办？那几天他昼夜谋划，想找出个两全的办法。后来，办法终于想出来了：把后犁柱改成两段，每段都旋上些眼子，使螺丝钉把它们接上，犁柱的高低可以调节，这样，问题就解决了：要浅可以浅到八寸，要深深到一尺五寸也行。
    社里使用这种犁耕地的时候，用壮牲口拉它，两头也拉得动。套耕的时候，后边那副犁是旧犁头，仅有犁尖没有犁翅，一头牲口拉不动，两头牲口又多了；两个犁铧安在一副犁上，三个牲口拉，正合适。
    王玉顺在创造双层双铧犁以前，除了夜以继日的赶制兴修水利工具、支援水利工程以外，还创造和改良了十三种农具。这次拿到全国农具展览会来的，除犁以外，还有一物两用的平地耙、两用锨、双头松土三齿耙、双头空心锄和打畦用的冲沟犁等五种农具。
