According to information obtained recently by the Jiangsu Province's thousand-person visiting groups sent to various places, after the cadres were transferred to the countryside, they not only achieved brilliant results in labor training, but also gave full play to their respective expertise and spread culture and technology everywhere.

    Xiong Peilin, a technical assistant from the Provincial Department of Agriculture, after being transferred to Mozhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Dongtai County, cooperated with the cooperative's production experts and the township's technology promotion station to run an agricultural technology spare-time school. Xiong Peilin worked during the day and compiled teaching materials and prepared lessons at night, often working until late at night. This year, they plan to combine the seasonal farming seasons to complete courses on the morphological characteristics of rice, wheat, cotton, and green manure, seed treatment, sowing techniques, and how to apply fertilizer rationally according to crop characteristics, learning while doing, and learning what techniques are needed for what work. When Xiong Peilin gave his first lecture, the county party secretary, township and cooperative cadres, team leaders, and middle and primary school graduates from the cooperative attended, with a total of more than eighty people listening to the lecture. The second time, the number increased to more than ninety. Many new farmers read the newspaper aloud to everyone during work breaks and attended civil schools at night. Some even delivered culture to people's doorsteps regardless of wind or rain, contracting to eliminate illiteracy among women burdened with children.

    Chen Yanrong, a twenty-four-year-old veterinary teacher, was asked to treat a sick buffalo in the cooperative on the day she settled in the cooperative. The young teacher, who had just graduated from the Subei Agricultural College, had never treated such a large animal alone before, and she was so nervous that her heart was pounding. She calmed down and carefully inquired about the condition and observed the cow's movements. Without medical equipment, she used her hands to feel and her ears to listen to the cow's abdomen. The diagnosis revealed that the cause of the cow's illness was impaction of the first stomach. She wrote a prescription and administered the medicine herself. The next day, the cow was better and willing to eat. Another time, a cow in the cooperative developed a mad disease, running around and rampaging everywhere. Folk veterinarians could not figure out what was wrong. Everyone tied the cow up and went to ask Chen Yanrong. Chen Yanrong took off her cotton coat and stretched her entire arm into the cow's anus to find the cause, but the intestines and stomach were normal. She boldly released the cow and led it to run, carefully observing the cow's movements. After various diagnoses, she confirmed that the cow was suffering from "hydrocephalus," and once the cause was found, folk veterinarians quickly cured the cow with acupuncture. In this way, Chen Yanrong cured twenty cows and ten pigs in a row, and from then on, the name "Veterinarian Chen" spread around the Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Jiangning County.

    The Yanfu Agricultural Cooperative in Jurong County has more than 1,000 mu of mulberry gardens. The new farmers Fan Xinying and Ye Peizhi used to work in sericulture. After being transferred to Yanfu Cooperative, they led the female members to the mulberry garden to prune branches, teaching women techniques while working. They also helped the cooperative formulate a small-section operation plan for the mulberry garden and explained the techniques of cultivating the mulberry garden to the members. The winter maintenance work of the mulberry garden in Yanfu Cooperative was better than any previous year. They guaranteed to train fifty silkworm breeding technicians and one hundred and forty-five mulberry seedling grafting and mulberry tree pruning personnel for the cooperative within one year. This year, they will implement various technical measures during silkworm rearing and strive to produce 100 kilograms of cocoons per silkworm egg sheet.

    Ding Jing, a teacher from the Provincial Youth League School who was transferred to the Heping Agricultural Cooperative in Suining County, saw that there was a lack of tools for applying water fertilizer here. A whole labor force had to carry two small earthenware jars, working from early morning to late at night, and could only irrigate six or seven tenths of a mu of land a day. He used his brains and successfully developed a water and manure tank. Using the water and manure tank, one person plus one animal can increase the efficiency of fertilization by more than ten times, enabling the entire team to complete two rounds of general topdressing of three wheat crops more than a month ahead of schedule. Suining County is preparing to widely promote the method of applying fertilizer with water and manure tanks.

    Ming?, a transferred cadre from the Provincial Cultural Goods Company, had some common sense in treating surgical diseases. He bought some medicines such as Xiaozhilong ointment, scabies ointment, red potion, and potassium permanganate, and often carried his medicine box to treat cooperative members at night or on rainy days when work was suspended, combining this with publicity and education on hygiene common sense. Seeing that most people in the village did not have water tanks and temporarily drew water from the pond to drink, which was very unhygienic, he mobilized everyone to separate drinking water ponds from sewage ponds to ensure drinking water hygiene.

### 江苏下放干部发挥所长  把文化和技术带给农村

    江苏下放干部发挥所长
　　把文化和技术带给农村
    本报讯　据最近江苏省派出的千人访问团分赴各地访问中了解，干部下放到农村以后，不但在劳动锻炼上取得了辉煌战果，很多还发挥各自特长，到处传布了文化和技术。
    省农业厅的技术助理员熊佩林，下放到东台县莫庄农业社后，和社里的生产能手及乡里的技术推广站合作，办了个农业技术业余学校。熊佩林白天劳动，晚上编教材、备课，经常工作到深夜。今年他们准备结合农时季节教完稻、麦、棉、绿肥的形态特征、种子处理、播种技术及如何按作物特性合理施肥等课程，边学边做，干什么活学什么技术。熊佩林第一次讲课时，县委书记、乡、社干部、小队长及社里的中、小学毕业生都去了，共八十多人听课，第二次增加到九十多人。很多新农民劳动休息时，读报给大家听，晚上到民校上课。有的还风雨无阻地把文化送上门，包干扫除有孩子牵累的妇女中的文盲。
    二十四岁的兽医教员陈艳容刚到社落户的那天，社里的一头水牛病了，大家就请她医治。这位苏北农学院毕业不久的年轻教员，从来没有单独替这么大的动物治过病，当时紧张得心里扑通扑通直跳，她沉住气仔细询问了病情，观察了牛的动静。没有医疗器械就用手摸，用耳朵贴在牛的腹部听。诊断结果找出这头牛的病因是第一胃积食。她开了药方，亲自动手灌药，第二天，这头牛好了，肯吃东西了。又一次，社里一头牛得了疯病，到处乱闯乱跑，民间兽医找不出是什么毛病。大家把牛捆起来，去请陈艳容。陈艳容脱下棉衣把整个胳膊从牛肛门里伸进去找病因，但肠胃都正常。她又大胆把牛放开，自己牵着让它跑，仔细观察牛的动作，经多方诊断，她肯定了牛患了“牛脑积水”的病，病因找出来了，民间兽医用针灸的办法很快把牛治好了。这样，陈艳容一连治好了二十头牛，十只猪，从此“陈兽医”这个名字就在江宁县五星农业社周围传开了。
    句容县延福农业社有一千多亩桑园。新农民范心莹和叶佩芝原是搞蚕桑工作的。她们下放到延福社后，带领着女社员到桑园整枝，边劳动边教妇女学技术。她们还帮助社里制订桑园小段作业计划，给社员们讲解培植桑园的技术。延福社的桑园冬季保养工作比任何一年都做得好。她们保证在一年内给社里培养五十名养蚕技术员，一百四十五名嫁接桑苗和桑树剪定人员。今年养蚕时贯彻各项技术措施，争取每张蚕种产茧一百斤。
    下放到睢宁县和平农业社的省团校教员丁竞看到这里缺少施水肥的工具，一个整劳动力挑两个小瓦罐子，起早带晚忙个不息，一天只能浇六、七分地。他就动脑筋试制成功一种水粪箱。利用水粪箱，一个人加上一头牲口，施肥效率提高十多倍，使全队提前一个多月完成了三麦普遍追肥两遍的任务。睢宁县准备普遍推广用水粪箱施肥的方法。
    省文化用品公司下放干部明?，有一些治理外科病的常识。他买了消治龙药膏、癞痢头药膏、红药水、灰锰氧等一些药物，常在晚上或阴雨歇工的日子，背着药箱登门给社员治疗，结合进行卫生常识的宣传教育。看到村上多数人家没有水缸，吃水临时到水塘里提起来就吃，很不卫生，他就动员大家把吃水池塘和污水池塘分开，保证饮水卫生。　（古平、徐文）
