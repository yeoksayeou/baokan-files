Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 9th (TASS): The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a plenary session on May 6th and 7th, and listened to and discussed the report by Comrade Khrushchev "On Accelerating the Development of the Chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic substances and their products, to meet the needs of the residents and the national economy." The meeting passed corresponding resolutions on this report and based on the measures drafted by the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.

The resolution pointed out that from 1959 to 1965, the production of the most important chemical products in the Soviet Union should be increased by at least two to three times, and the production of man-made fibers, synthetic fibers, and plastics should be increased by at least four and a half to eight times. The resolution stipulates that by the end of 1965, the production capacity of man-made fibers and synthetic fibers should reach 4.6 times that of 1957, plastics and synthetic resins should reach eight times, and synthetic rubber should reach 3.4 times.

The Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee believes that the proposal to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, especially man-made fibers, synthetic fibers, plastics and other synthetic substances, is correct and timely. The production of these substances is necessary to meet the needs of residents for clothing, shoes, textiles, household goods, as well as the needs of industry, agriculture and construction. Under the current conditions, solving this task is of great political significance.

The resolution pointed out that the Soviet Union possesses all the necessary conditions to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, and the Soviet Union possesses inexhaustible raw material resources. In addition to agricultural raw materials, the use of synthetic substances can greatly increase the production of clothing, shoes, textiles, and household goods. The products produced from these substances are not only not inferior to products made from natural materials in terms of quality, sturdiness, durability, and aesthetics, but also far exceed them. The use of synthetic materials in industry and construction can improve labor productivity, replace ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and alloys on a larger scale, and further industrialize construction projects.

The Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee requires Party, Soviet, trade union, Communist Youth League, and economic organs to mobilize all the strength of the staff of relevant enterprises, scientific research and design organs to increase the production of chemical products, fully accelerate the construction of enterprises, design novel and advanced technological processes and various highly productive equipment, solve major scientific and technological problems, and seek more effective methods for manufacturing new chemical products.

The plenary session agreed with the initiative of the Communist Youth League to voluntarily and regularly help the construction of chemical, petroleum and gas industrial enterprises, and decided to send enthusiastic young people to these construction sites.

    促使苏联国民经济大跃进
　　苏共中央决定加速发展化学工业
    据新华社9日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3日讯：苏联共产党中央委员会在5月6日到7日举行了全体会议，听取和讨论了赫鲁晓夫同志所作的“关于加速发展化学工业、特别是合成物质及其制品的生产，以满足居民的需求和国民经济的需要”的报告。会议就这个报告并根据苏共中央主席团和苏联部长会议所拟定的措施，通过了相应的决议。
    决议指出，从1959年到1965年，苏联最重要的化学产品的生产至少要增加到两倍到三倍，而人造纤维、合成纤维和塑料的生产至少要增加到四倍半到八倍。决议规定，到1965年年底，生产人造纤维和合成纤维的能力要达到1957年的四点六倍，塑料和合成树脂要达到八倍，合成橡胶要达到三点四倍。
    苏共中央全会认为，提出关于加速发展化学工业，特别是人造纤维、合成纤维、塑料和其他合成物质的问题的建议是正确而及时的。这些物质的生产是满足居民对衣服、皮鞋、纺织品、家常用品方面的需要以及工农业和建筑业的需要所必需的。在现在的条件下，解决这个任务具有巨大的政治意义。
    决议指出，苏联拥有一切必要的条件来加速发展化学工业，苏联拥有取之不尽的原料资源。在农业原料之外，采用合成物质就可以大大增加衣服、皮鞋、纺织品和家常用品的产量。用这些物质所生产出来的制品，在质量、坚固、耐久和美观方面不仅不比用天然材料制成的制品逊色，而且还远远超过它们。在工业中和建筑中采用合成材料就可能提高劳动生产率，在更大的范围内代替黑色金属、有色金属和合金，并且使建筑工程进一步工业化。
    苏共中央全体会议要求党、苏维埃、工会、青年团和经济机关动员有关企业、科学研究和设计机关的工作人员的一切力量，增加化学品的生产，全力加速企业的建设，设计新颖的先进的工艺过程和各种有高度生产效率的设备，解决重大的科学技术问题和寻求制造新化学产品的更有效的方法。
    全体会议同意共青团提出的自愿经常帮助化学、石油和煤气工业企业的建设和决定把热情的青年队伍派到这些建筑工地上去的倡议。
