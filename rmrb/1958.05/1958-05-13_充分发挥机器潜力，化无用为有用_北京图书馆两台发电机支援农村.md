    Fully Exploit Machine Potential, Turn the Useless into Useful
　　Beijing Library Supports Rural Areas with Two Generators

    (Our Newspaper) News: The Beijing Library had two Siemens three-phase generators, which used to supply electricity to the library. After the "July 7th" Incident, when the library switched to using electricity from the power company, the two generators were taken out of service. During the twenty years of being idle, the technicians paid close attention to the maintenance of the machines, cleaning them regularly, and testing them once a year, so the machines were not damaged at all.

    Recently, in response to the call of "the Central Government supporting the local areas," the Beijing Library decided to transfer these two generators to Guan County, Shandong Province free of charge, in order to fully exploit the role of the machines, turn the useless into useful, and vigorously support agricultural construction and local industry. On May 7th, a handover ceremony was held at the Beijing Library, and the two machines were transported to Guan County, Shandong Province, on the same day.

    充分发挥机器潜力，化无用为有用
　　北京图书馆两台发电机支援农村
    本报讯　北京图书馆原有西门子牌三相式发电机两台，过去曾供应该馆用电；“七七”事变后，改用电灯公司电后，两台发电机即停止使用。在二十年的闲置中，技工们对机器保养十分注意，经常擦洗，每年并试车一次，所以机器毫无损坏。
    最近为了响应“中央支援地方”的号召，北京图书馆决定把这两台发电机无偿地拨给山东冠县，以便充分发挥机器的作用，化无用为有用，大力支援农业建设和地方工业。5月7日，在北京图书馆举行了交接仪式，并于当日将这两台机器运往山东冠县。
