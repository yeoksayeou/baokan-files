Notes

	"The Voice of France"

De Gaulle's arrogant declaration demanding control of French power has been applauded by some fascists. "Le Parisien Libéré," which has consistently advocated for De Gaulle to implement a fascist dictatorship in France, was so carried away that it described De Gaulle's clamoring as "the voice of France."

However, this "voice of France" did not resonate. The short commentary in "Le Parisien Libéré" praising De Gaulle's declaration was destroyed by a group of patriotic French youth before it even reached the readers. Clearly, the patriotic French youth do not believe that De Gaulle's declaration is "the voice of France." On the contrary, they believe it is a voice that endangers France, and that is why they bravely stepped forward to destroy the printing plates of "Le Parisien Libéré."

From the actions of this group of patriotic French youth, it can be seen that blocking and preventing De Gaulle's path to fascism is the true "voice of France" today.

### “法国的声音”

    “法国的声音”
    戴高乐要求掌握法国大权的狂妄声明，获得了一些法西斯分子的喝彩。一向主张由戴高乐在法国实行法西斯专政的“解放了的巴黎人报”，竟得意忘形地把戴高乐的叫嚷形容成为“法国的声音”。
    但是，这个“法国的声音”并没有叫响。“解放了的巴黎人报”赞扬戴高乐的声明的短论，还没有等到它同读者见面，就被一群法国爱国青年把它的版子捣毁了。显然，法国的爱国青年并不认为戴高乐的声明是“法国的声音”，相反的，他们认为这是危害法国的声音，所以才奋勇当先地捣毁了“解放了的巴黎人报”的版子。
    从这一群法国爱国青年的行动中，人们可以看出，堵塞和阻止戴高乐的法西斯道路，这才是今天真正的“法国的声音”。
