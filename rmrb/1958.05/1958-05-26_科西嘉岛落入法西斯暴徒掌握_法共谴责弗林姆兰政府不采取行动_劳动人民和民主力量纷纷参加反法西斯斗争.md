Xinhua News Agency, May 25th, Paris dispatch: The struggle between French democratic forces to defend the republican system and fascist forces is further intensifying. On the 24th, the fascist group expanded the riot situation in Algeria to Corsica, a French island in the Mediterranean.

Under the direct instigation of representatives sent by the Algerian riot group, a group of French paratroopers dispatched from the Carvi army base near Ajaccio, the capital of Corsica, along with fascist thugs, occupied the provincial government of Ajaccio on the evening of the 24th. Following the example of the Algerian rioters, they announced the establishment of a "Committee of Public Safety" and took over the administrative power of Corsica.

The Pflimlin government held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 24th. In a subsequent radio address, Pflimlin demanded that the civil and military personnel on Corsica "refuse to execute" the orders of the "Committee of Public Safety," and stated that legal "prosecution" would be carried out against those who participated in the riots. Beyond this, no effective measures were taken to deal with the rioters who overthrew the local legitimate government. In a statement issued today, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party condemned the Pflimlin government for not taking action against the fascist offensive. The statement pointed out that the events on Corsica were the result of this attitude of the government. The statement said: "Now is no longer the time to hesitate. The government must take immediate action." The Political Bureau called on all party members and working people to be doubly vigilant. It also reiterated its call for all republican parties to establish close ties in order to take joint action.

The French General Confederation of Labor also called on all trade union organizations to unite in the face of common danger and smash the conspiracy against the republic.

At the same time, working people all over France are establishing anti-fascist committees.

More than 120 professors and other prominent figures from universities in Paris and other provinces have decided to establish a National Vigilance Committee to defend the Republic. Together with representatives of about 30 vigilance committees already established in higher and secondary education institutions, they issued a call to higher education workers, pointing out the serious threat posed by the military coup in Algeria, and calling for the establishment of vigilance committees in all schools in France.

A "National Anti-Fascist Student Committee" has also been established in France. Representatives of student groups such as the French Communist Student Union, the Socialist Left Student Union, and the National Federation of Radical Socialist Students are participating in this committee.

Social organizations such as the National Executive Committee of the Movement Against Racism and Anti-Semitism, the National Association of Algerian Veterans, and the National Association of Metallurgical Industry Engineers and Technicians have also risen up to defend the republican system.

    科西嘉岛落入法西斯暴徒掌握
    法共谴责弗林姆兰政府不采取行动
    劳动人民和民主力量纷纷参加反法西斯斗争
    据新华社25日讯　巴黎消息：法国民主力量为保卫共和制度同法西斯势力进行的斗争正进一步尖锐化。法西斯集团24日把阿尔及利亚的暴乱局面扩大到地中海中属于法国本土的科西嘉岛。
    在阿尔及利亚暴乱集团派遣代表的直接策动下，一批从科西嘉岛首府阿耶佐附近喀尔维陆军基地出动的法国伞兵24日傍晚伙同法西斯暴徒，占领了阿耶佐的省政府，并且按照阿尔及利亚暴乱分子的榜样，宣布成立“救国委员会”，接管科西嘉岛的行政权。
    弗林姆兰政府24日晚举行了紧急会议。弗林姆兰在随后发表的广播演说，要求科西嘉岛的民政和军事人员“拒绝执行”“救国委员会”的命令，并且表示将对参加暴乱的人进行法律“起诉”。除此以外，也没有采取任何有力的措施来对付推翻当地合法政府的暴乱分子。法国共产党中央委员会政治局在今天发表的声明里谴责弗林姆兰政府不对法西斯进攻采取行动。声明指出，科西嘉岛的事件正是政府这种态度所造成的结果。声明说：“现在再也不是拖延不决的时候了。政府必须立即采取行动。”政治局号召全体党员和劳动人民加倍警惕。它并且再次号召所有共和党派建立紧密的联系以便采取共同行动。
    法国总工会也呼吁所有的工会组织面对共同的危险，团结起来粉碎反对共和国的阴谋。
    同时，法国各地劳动人民正在纷纷成立反法西斯委员会。
    巴黎及外省各高等学校的一百二十多位教授及其他著名人士决定成立全国警惕委员会以保卫共和国。他们和已经在高等和中等教育机构中建立起来约三十个警惕委员会的代表共同向高等学校工作人员发出号召，指出阿尔及利亚军事政变所造成的严重威胁，号召在法国所有的学校都成立警惕委员会。
    在法国还成立了“全国反法西斯学生委员会”。参加这个委员会的有法兰西共产主义学生联盟、社会党左派学生联盟、激进社会党学生全国联合会等学生团体的代表。
    反对种族主义、反对反犹太主义运动全国执行委员会，阿尔及利亚退伍军人全国协会，冶金工业工程师和技师全国协会等社会团体也起来维护共和制。（附图片）
