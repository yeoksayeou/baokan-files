　　The Birth of a Water Ditch
    This spring, the youth of Hemeng Village in Shuangjiang County, Yunnan Province, decided to dig a water ditch. The older generation had tried to dig this ditch several times before, but there was a section of sheer cliffs in the middle, and they couldn't find a way to get through. The "Guitou" (village elder in charge of sacrifices and divination) obstructed them, saying: there are ghosts and gods there, and the older generation couldn't dig through it, so you can't bring the water over either. Most of the young people were educated by the fact of land reclamation last year and did not believe the words of the Guitou, saying that we have the leadership of the Communist Party, and with the help of the government, we will definitely be able to dig through it. The Guitou also said: if you want to repair the ditch, you have to kill chickens for sacrifice and see if the rooster's comb is good, only if the comb is good can you repair it. At this time, the Communist Youth League branch organized the youth to debate "Do we need to repair the ditch to develop production?" "If the youth don't repair the ditch and only kill chickens, will the water come through?" After the debate, their thinking was clear, so thirty-two young people from Hemeng Village organized a ditch-repairing shock team, asked comrades from the County Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Section to help them with surveying, and sent four young people, including Tian Laoda and Bao Lao Si, to learn drilling and blasting techniques. The county also sent foreign shovels, explosives, and other supplies, and the ditch-repairing project began.
    The project to repair the large stone cliff section was extremely difficult. Even nimble rock goats would find it difficult to pass on the sheer cliffs, and people would be smashed to pieces if they fell. But the young people were determined to repair the ditch. Tian Laoda and Bao Lao Si and other four young people volunteered to tie themselves tightly with large ropes and go to the large stone cliff to drill holes and set off cannons. After forty days of fighting, a two-li long water ditch that could irrigate one hundred mu of land was completed. When the clear spring water flowed around, the young people all looked at it and laughed. They said: It's better to listen to the Communist Party. Without the leadership of the Party and the help of the government, the water would not come even if we only killed chickens to sacrifice to ghosts. (Attached picture)

### 一条水沟的诞生

　　一条水沟的诞生
    今年春天云南省双江县贺勐村的青年决定去挖一条水沟，这条沟老辈人曾经挖过几次，但中间有一段是悬岩峭壁，找了几条沟路都没有挖通。“鬼头”（村寨中掌握祭祀和卜卦的长者）阻挠说：那里有鬼神，老辈人都挖不通，你们也不能把水引过来。大多数青年由于去年开荒的事实受到了教育，不相信鬼头的话，说我们有共产党的领导，有政府的帮助就一定能挖得通。鬼头又说：要修沟就要杀鸡祭祀，看鸡冠好不好，鸡冠好才能修。这时团支部组织青年辩论“要发展生产要不要修沟”？“如果青年不动手修沟，光杀鸡，水会不会通过来”？经过辩论，思想通了，于是贺勐村的三十二个青年组织了一个修水沟突击队，请县农林水利科的同志帮助他们测量，又派了田老大、保老四等四个青年去学习打炮眼和爆破技术，县上又送来了洋锹、炸药等物资，修水沟的工程就开始了。
    修大石岩那一段工程是十分艰巨的。在悬岩峭壁上就是灵巧的岩羊也难于通过，人要是跌下去就会粉身碎骨。可是青年们决心要修好沟，田老大和保老四等四个青年自告奋勇，用大绳子拴紧在身上，到大石岩上去打眼放炮。经过四十天战斗，一条二里长能灌溉一百亩田的水沟修通了，当清清的泉水绕流过来时，青年们都望着它发笑，他们说：还是听共产党的话好，如果没有党的领导和政府的帮助，光杀鸡祭鬼，水还是不会来。（附图片）
