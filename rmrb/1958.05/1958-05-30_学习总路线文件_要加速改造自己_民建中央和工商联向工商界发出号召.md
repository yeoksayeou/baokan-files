Xinhua News Agency Report: The Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce held a joint meeting on the afternoon of May 26, calling on industrial and commercial circles across the country to accelerate the completion of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, and to contribute even more to the cultural and technological revolutions.

This symposium was specifically convened to study the general line for socialist construction formulated at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. In addition to the central (executive) committee members of the two associations in Beijing, leaders of industrial and commercial circles from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and other places also participated in the symposium. Speakers unanimously agreed that the Chinese Communist Party's proposal of the general line for socialist construction to the people of the whole country is a major event in the political life of our people. This general line is a beacon illuminating the people of the whole country in carrying out socialist construction, and also a beacon guiding the work of members of the two associations and industrial and commercial people across the country. Members of the two associations must, in conjunction with the ongoing "heart-to-heart" movement, earnestly study this great document, and should take accepting the general line as a symbol of accepting the leadership of the Party and taking the socialist road.

After discussion and analysis, the participants in the symposium believed that the following points in the entire general line are particularly closely related to industrial and commercial circles, and sufficient understanding must be had: First, consolidate and develop socialist ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Second, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Third, continue to complete the socialist revolution on the economic, political, and ideological fronts. Fourth, after transforming their thinking and stance, bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals in our country have the potential to contribute even more to the cultural and technological revolutions. The two associations should play an organizational and promoting role in this regard.

The symposium also believes that the complacency and fatigue towards the self-reform movement that has begun to appear among some industrialists and businesspeople is a serious obstacle to the industrial and commercial circles in implementing the general line of socialist construction. This kind of thinking, in essence, is an attempt to retain some bourgeois ideas and lacks the determination to completely transform oneself; it must be quickly corrected.

    学习总路线文件  要加速改造自己
    民建中央和工商联向工商界发出号召
    新华社讯　中国民主建国会中央委员会和全国工商业联合会26日下午举行联席会议，号召全国工商界加速完成政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命，并且在文化革命和技术革命中贡献更大的力量。
    这个座谈会是为了学习中共八大二次会议制定的社会主义建设总路线而专门召开的。参加座谈会的除两会在京的中央（执行）委员外，北京、天津、河北等地的工商界领导人也参加了座谈。发言的人一致认为，中国共产党向全国人民提出了社会主义建设的总路线，这是我国人民政治生活中的重大事件。这条总路线是照耀全国人民进行社会主义建设的灯塔，也是指导民建成员和全国工商业者进行一切工作的灯塔。两会成员都必须结合正在进行的交心运动，认真学习这个伟大的文献，并且应该把接受总路线作为接受党的领导和走社会主义道路的标志。
    参加座谈会的人经过讨论分析，认为整个总路线中有以下几点与工商界的关系特别密切，必须有足够的认识：一，巩固和发展社会主义的全民所有制和集体所有制。二，巩固无产阶级专政。三，要继续完成经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。四，我国资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子在改造了思想、立场之后，有可能在文化革命和技术革命中贡献更大的力量。两会组织要在这方面起组织和推动作用。
    座谈会还认为，目前部分工商业者中开始出现的对自我改造运动的自满和疲塌情绪，是工商界贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线的严重障碍。这种思想，实质上是企图保留一些资产阶级思想，缺乏彻底脱胎换骨改造自己的决心，必须迅速纠正。
