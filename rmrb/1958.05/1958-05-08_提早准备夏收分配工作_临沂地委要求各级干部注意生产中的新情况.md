Xinhua News Agency, Linyi, 7th. The Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shandong Province has taken measures to address the various ideological problems of rural grassroots cadres who neglect summer distribution work, and to make full preparations for doing a good job in summer distribution.

The wheat ripening period is not far off, and preparations for summer distribution urgently need to be carried out. However, according to investigations conducted by the Linyi Prefectural Committee in some agricultural cooperatives and reports from various counties, many rural grassroots cadres have thoughts of neglecting summer distribution. Some believe that summer distribution is an annual event, with past experience, and that the current production tasks are urgent, so it doesn't matter if it's done later; others believe that this year's wheat production plans are so high that even if a distribution plan is formulated, it will inevitably be a "blank check," so it's better to talk about it later. In short, they believe that distribution preparation work should be delayed rather than done early.

After in-depth investigation, the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party analyzed the conditions for this year's summer distribution work. The Prefectural Committee believes that under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the socialist production enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members has soared to unprecedented levels, and the management level of agricultural cooperatives has leaped forward a big step, especially the third-class cooperatives have mostly changed their original backward state. These are naturally favorable conditions for doing a good job in this year's summer distribution. However, with the situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, a series of new situations and problems have also been brought to the distribution work. For example, investment in farmland capital construction has generally increased, the collective accumulation within the cooperative needs to be large, the labor intensity of the commune members has increased, the labor workdays have doubled, and they also require more grain to be distributed in the summer harvest. How to achieve reasonable labor quotas, how to estimate wheat yields more closely to reality, and so on, have all undergone a series of changes. These new changes have been submerged by the various thoughts of some grassroots cadres who neglect summer distribution.

For this reason, the Linyi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued an urgent notice, requiring Party committees at all levels to educate the broad masses of cadres to recognize the great significance of doing a good job in this year's summer distribution work for further promoting production and consolidating agricultural cooperatives.

### 提早准备夏收分配工作  临沂地委要求各级干部注意生产中的新情况

    提早准备夏收分配工作
    临沂地委要求各级干部注意生产中的新情况
    据新华社临沂7日电　中共山东省临沂地委采取措施解决农村基层干部忽视夏季分配工作的种种思想问题，为做好夏季分配进行充分准备。
    目前距小麦成熟期已经不远，夏季分配的准备工作急待进行。但是根据临沂地委在部分农业社的摸底和各县汇报的情况看来，许多农村的基层干部存在着忽视夏季分配的思想。他们有的认为夏季分配一年一度，过去已有经验，当前生产任务紧迫，迟些搞没啥；有的认为今年小麦生产计划那样高，就是制订了分配方案也脱不了“放空炮”，不如以后再说。总之是认为分配准备工作宜迟不宜早。
    中共临沂地委经过深入的调查，对今年的夏季分配工作条件作了分析。地委认为，在大跃进的形势下，广大社员社会主义生产热情空前高涨，农业社经营管理水平跃进了一大步，特别是三类社大都已改变原来的落后面貌。这些，自然是今年做好夏季分配工作的有利条件。但是随着生产大跃进的形势，也给分配工作带来许多新的情况和问题。例如农田基本建设投资普遍增多，社内公共积累需要大，社员的劳动强度增高，劳动工日倍增，他们又要求夏收中多分粮食，劳动定额怎样达到合理，怎样把小麦产量估计得更接近实际等，都发生了一系列的变化。这些新的变化被一些基层干部忽视夏季分配的种种思想淹没了。
    中共临沂地委为此发出紧急通知，要求各级党委必须教育广大干部，认识作好今年夏季分配工作对进一步推动生产和巩固农业社的重大意义。
