　　Summer harvest and planting labor and animal power shortages can be overcome
　　Reforming farm tools is an effective solution
    This newspaper reports that Jiangsu Province has more than 50 million mu of summer crops that will be harvested in about half a month. At the same time as the summer harvest, 30 million mu of rice, 10 million mu of sweet potatoes, 7 million mu of soybeans, and a total of 60 million mu of summer planting crops such as peanuts and corn will also be sown and transplanted in a timely manner. The labor required during such a busy period will be even greater than in previous years.
    From May 3rd to 8th, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a farm tool reform promotion conference, criticizing the erroneous views of utopian mechanization and waiting for mechanization. It required everyone to realize that to solve the difficulties of labor shortages, we must find a solution from the reform of farm tools. Whether the farm tool reform movement is carried out well or badly is a question of promoting or hindering current production. Among the more than 800 new farm tools exhibited at the meeting, there were many farm tools for summer harvesting and planting, which were promoted after visits and appraisals.
    Now, local party committees have taken farm tool reform as an important way to solve the shortage of labor, put forward the slogan of reforming farm tools to meet the summer harvest and planting, and, according to priorities, focused on farm tools that have the greatest effect on solving labor difficulties in current production, and launched a mass farm tool reform movement.

    This newspaper reports that the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China demanded on the 9th that all localities should grasp the work of summer harvest and planting as firmly as they grasped agricultural capital construction and spring production in the previous period.
    The summer crops in Shaanxi Province this year are generally growing well. At present, a small number of areas have begun harvesting. Wheat and summer grains account for 56%-60% of the province's total grain output. Striving for a bumper summer harvest is of decisive significance for the successful realization of the annual grain production plan. The Provincial Party Committee requires all localities to unswervingly rely on the masses, promote improved farm tools, and change the phenomenon of only paying attention to creation and invention while neglecting promotion, and appropriately solve the problem of insufficient labor and animal power for summer harvest and planting. In the promotion of new farm tools, we must focus on the promotion of farm tools for harvesting, threshing, transportation, and sowing. The Provincial Party Committee has instructed the Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry to convene a summer harvest improvement farm tool promotion meeting in the near future. Summer harvest improvement farm tools with universal value should be widely promoted in all localities. The Provincial Party Committee also requires all localities to conduct a general inspection of the planting of cotton and spring-sown crops to ensure the completion of the planned planting area.
    The Provincial Party Committee also requires that the main tasks of rectification and commune rectification, summer field bumper harvest appraisal, and cooperative income distribution be combined before the summer harvest to launch a major debate. Through lively and vivid methods such as big-character posters, exhibitions, and door-to-door rectification, we should boldly mobilize the masses, let everyone speak out freely, contend freely, and debate thoroughly, and make ideological work deep and thorough.

　　夏收夏种人畜力不足的困难可以克服
　　改革农具是有效办法
    本报讯　江苏省五千多万亩夏熟作物还有半月左右就要开镰收割，三千多万亩水稻，一千万亩山芋，七百万亩大豆及花生、玉米等共六千万亩夏种作物，也要在夏收同时及时播种栽插。这样大忙期间所需劳力就比往年更多。
    中共江苏省委5月3日至8日召开了农具改革促进大会，批判了空想机械化和等待机械化的错误观点，要求大家认识到要解决劳动力不足的困难，必须从改革农具方面找出路，农具改革运动搞得好或坏，是对当前生产促进或是促退的问题。会上展出的八百多件新农具中，有很多夏收夏种用的农具，经过参观、鉴定，得到推广。
    现在，各地党委已把农具改革当作解决劳力不足的重要途径，提出了改革农具迎接夏收夏种的口号，分别轻重缓急，以当前生产中对解决劳动力困难作用最大的农具为重点，开展了群众性的农具改革运动。　（古平）
    本报讯　中共陕西省委9日要求各地要像前一个时期抓农业基本建设和春季生产那样，狠狠地抓夏收夏种工作。
    陕西省今年的夏田作物普遍生长良好，目前，少部分地区已经开始收割。全省的小麦和夏杂粮占粮食总产量的56％—60％，力争夏田大丰收，对胜利实现全年粮食生产计划有着决定性的意义。省委要求各地坚定不移地依靠群众，推广改良农具，改变那种只注意创造发明而忽视推广的现象，适当解决夏收夏种的劳畜力不足的问题。在推广新式农具中，要重点推广收割、打场、运输和播种等农具。省委已责成省农林厅在最近召开一次夏收改良农具推广会。对有普遍价值的夏收改良农具，各地要普遍推广。省委还要求各地普遍检查棉花和春播作物的种植情况，保证完成计划种植面积。
    省委还要求在夏收前把整风整社和夏田丰产评比、合作社的收益分配等几项主要工作结合起来，展开一次大辩论。通过大字报、展览会、登门整改等生动活泼的方式，放手发动群众，大鸣大放，大争大辩，把思想工作搞深搞透。　（韩国英）
