Hero Factory with Original Style
By our correspondent Xu Jiazhu

Last year, Soviet metallurgical expert Istrian visited the local state-owned Benxi Alloy Factory. He was greatly surprised to see that this poor factory used the most backward local methods to refine many valuable alloys. Before leaving, he could not help but embrace the factory director and said, "This factory is a great creation of the Chinese working class!"

The Benxi Alloy Factory started from scratch. When the factory was set up on a trial basis in 1950, all the production equipment was borrowed from Shenyang: a large pot, two spoons, and three molds. At that time, there were only four workers, and there was no factory building.

Today, the Benxi Alloy Factory has 600 employees and can refine more than 270 kinds of precious metals such as copper, aluminum, nickel, lead, and other alloys, as well as refined copper and electrolytic copper. Many of the unique alloys it produces are sold to more than 1,200 important enterprises across the country and are also exported to North Korea, Vietnam, and Southeast Asia. Last year, the total output value of the Benxi Alloy Factory reached more than 42 million yuan. According to the current measures, the total output value can rise to more than 100 million yuan this year, making it one of the largest industrial enterprises in Benxi, the city of coal and iron.

The Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China recently summarized the factory's experience in running enterprises diligently and thriftily with a spirit of originality, believing that this factory is a vivid example of starting a business and developing industry at high speed.

Alloys from the "Bagua Furnace"

The Alloy Factory is indeed a factory that dares to think, dares to act, and creates boldly.

When the factory was built in 1950, the only person in the entire factory who understood a little bit about alloy smelting technology was the current factory director, Su Xinjun. At that time, he was a technician, leading a group of workers to sleep in the factory, often trying to refine alloys without rest. Because there was no factory building, they worked in the open air. When it rained, the molten metal would explode when it encountered rain. They had to lift broken iron plates weighing twenty or thirty kilograms to block the rain, and their bodies were drenched.

"No factory building, the blue sky is the roof; no funds, picking up scraps everywhere," people described the scene in the early days of the factory's construction. Most of the factory buildings were built by the factory's employees themselves. At the beginning, leading cadres and the masses together picked up some old wooden poles, old wooden boards, broken straw bags, and dug a little yellow mud to build simple mud factory buildings. As the stoves gradually increased, old wooden boards could not be found. The workers braved the severe cold and often refined alloys in wooden sheds without roofs. The chimneys of general factories are built of reinforced concrete or red bricks. The Alloy Factory could not afford these materials, so it collected a batch of old stinky oil drums and welded them into seven strange-looking chimneys, saving 270,000 yuan. The alloy melt is as high as 1,000 degrees Celsius, but there is a special shortage of refractory materials needed to repair the furnace. The factory director led nine old workers to Tianjin to learn how to build China's ancient smelting equipment - the Bagua furnace. Some people once called the leading cadres and workers of the Alloy Factory "omnipotent workers." They are smelting workers, as well as mud workers, tilers, and carpenters. They collected old bricks and a small amount of refractory materials, referred to the construction method of the Bagua furnace, combined the theory in the books, used their brains, and created various smelting furnaces. When the reflective furnace for electrolytic copper was first built, someone sarcastically said, "If you can refine copper water, I will drink it!" Some workers knew that only Shenyang Smelting Plant had a reflective furnace for copper smelting, as well as a large chimney more than 100 meters high, while they were almost empty-handed, without materials or high-level technology, and had no confidence in building the furnace. Su Xinjun told them the story of Comrade He Long mobilizing the masses, starting with kitchen knives, and creating a red base. The road is made by people. Everyone repeatedly experimented, and did not give up even if they failed. Finally, they built a reflective furnace with old materials without spending a penny. When the copper was produced, the person who made the sarcastic remarks at the beginning walked out of the workshop in shame.

From the beginning of its construction to the present, the Alloy Factory has spent a total of only more than 770,000 yuan in investment, while the profits turned over to the state last year reached more than 5.8 million yuan, which is less than the zero number of the factory's accumulated funds in one year.

After seeing the "local furnace" that could not be found in any textbooks in the Alloy Factory, Soviet expert Istrian was amazed: "Who can believe that these valuable alloys are refined in this way!" He drew detailed diagrams of the smelting furnace created by the workers and took them to the Soviet Union.

Helping others at a loss

The Alloy Factory also has a unique style in its management, which is to take the initiative to serve state-owned industries.

Before liberation, the alloys needed in our country depended on imports from abroad. During the first five-year plan, the output and variety of the Alloy Factory gradually increased, but few people across the country knew that there was an alloy factory in Benxi. The Alloy Factory sent people to Beijing to participate in some professional conferences and distributed product catalogs and promotional leaflets to the representatives of state-owned factories attending the meeting. In order to save the country's foreign exchange, the Alloy Factory also sent special personnel to contact the Ministry of Foreign Trade and import and export companies. If they found that the factory had the conditions to produce alloys and other factories proposed to order from abroad, they applied to take over the order. Dalian Shipbuilding Company originally proposed to purchase a batch of imported copper alloys. After the Alloy Factory learned about it in the import and export company, they immediately took the initiative to contact the shipbuilding company and drew this batch of orders from the imported materials list.

This style of the Benxi Alloy Factory is based on the idea of socialist cooperation. When the Alloy Factory knew that other factories needed technically complex alloys, they did not spare any effort to try to produce them, and they were often willing to lose money. Last year, the Alloy Factory learned that Dalian Shipbuilding Company urgently needed a batch of nickel alloys, otherwise the ships could not be launched. At the beginning, some comrades in the Alloy Factory felt that the cost of trial-producing nickel alloys was high and the factory was small, and they could not afford to lose money. After debate, everyone felt that it was a small matter for one factory to lose money, and the development of the entire shipbuilding industry was a major matter, so they took the initiative to tell the shipbuilding company that they were willing to trial-produce nickel alloys. The Alloy Factory often accepted sporadic orders without fear of trouble. Even if they ordered two or three kilograms of alloys, they were very happy to accept them. A large state-owned factory failed to trial-produce aluminum-manganese alloys for three years, and the Alloy Factory bravely tried to refine them, and finally succeeded in smelting them with local methods. Therefore, the Alloy Factory enjoys a high reputation in many industrial enterprises. When the Alloy Factory encounters difficulties that the factory cannot solve, other units will immediately support them with manpower and material resources as long as they make a long-distance phone call.

Under the policy of taking the initiative to serve state-owned industries, the products of the Alloy Factory have increased from two at the beginning to more than 270. Now it has been called the "night pearl" in the alloy industry by some state-owned factories.

The continuous and large-scale trial production of new products makes the employees of the Alloy Factory often encounter difficulties. However, the employees constantly compare themselves with the current needs of the country and feel that the alloys produced by the factory are far from meeting the needs of the country. Therefore, they have always maintained a high degree of enthusiasm. More than 60% of the workers in the factory save money and spend frugally, often buying and reading various technical books, and many workers often study until late at night. In the process of trial production of a large number of new products, the Alloy Factory has cultivated 21 technicians and more than 250 skilled workers.

Leaders have never left the workers' area

Since 1955, the leading cadres of the Alloy Factory have been leading production in production and leading the masses among the masses, just like ordinary laborers.

Since 1955, the task of trial-producing new products in the factory has been heavy. Every time a new alloy is trial-refined, the leading cadres always operate with the workers next to the hot furnace. The leading cadres often "take the lead" and take the lead in carrying out the most difficult tasks. Su Xinjun brought his bedding to the factory and tried to refine alloys non-stop for several days and nights. Sometimes when he was extremely sleepy, he would spread a straw bag next to the furnace and take a nap in the cotton quilt covered with metal slag. The leading cadres have been participating in production for a long time, and they are also familiar with the technology of the industry. Factory director Su Xinjun is already the most experienced technician in the factory. Deputy Factory Director Ge Liansheng came to the factory in 1955 and began to learn how to refine alloys. Now about half of the products in the factory can be technically guided by him.

The leading cadres of the Alloy Factory have not moved out of the workers' residential area for eight years. They lived with the workers in ancient temples. Two years ago, the Benxi Municipal Bureau of Industry wanted to build buildings as dormitories for the cadres of the Alloy Factory. The leading cadres of the Alloy Factory did not agree. They advocated building low-cost bungalows and living with the workers. They used the money saved by reducing the cost of dormitories to build a laboratory that the factory badly needed. After the bungalows were built, the leading cadres were with the employees, discussing how to distribute the dormitories as ordinary workers. Last year, Zhang Siwei, secretary of the Party branch, used his holidays and spare time to lead a group of employees in voluntary labor. They dug the foundation, carried stones, and built mud walls to build 38 houses for workers who lacked housing. Zhang Siwei often went to the single workers' dormitory to help clean the house. Su Xinjun, Zhang Siwei and others lived in the workers' area for a long time, and it was easy to find out the big and small problems in the workers' lives. They found that the toilets in the factory were not enough, and the secretary of the Party branch took the lead in building toilets near the workers' activity place. They also cared about the lives of the workers' families. They found that the mountain road that the workers' children had to pass when they went to school was rugged and difficult to walk, so they took the lead in opening up a winding road on the mountain.

In the Alloy Factory, it is rare to see people unreasonably making trouble about wages or housing. Even if it happens occasionally, it will be considered a strange thing by the employees. Some workers said: "When I first entered the Alloy Factory, I saw that everything was broken and the welfare benefits were low, so I thought of going to work in a state-owned factory. However, when I saw the leading cadres working with everyone regardless of morning and evening, I didn't want to leave!"

Strong Political Atmosphere

The Alloy Factory mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties with political and ideological work as the vanguard. The leading cadres of the factory have such an experience: "Discussing things with the masses will find thousands of brilliant ideas."

Two years ago, the country lacked coke, and the Alloy Factory had to use coke to refine alloys. The factory explained to the employees: The factory is extremely short of coke. If a solution cannot be found, the alloys cannot be refined, which will affect the production of many important industrial sectors. Many workers knew the political significance of this matter and thought of ways overnight. In two or three days, many technical solutions for saving coke appeared in the factory. Finally, the workers successfully built a new underground reflective furnace, which could completely use coal instead of coke as fuel, ensuring the normal production of the factory.

The Benxi Alloy Factory never mobilizes the masses with a purely economic point of view. The Alloy Factory has been insisting on production under the condition of raw material shortage for several years. The factory put forward the slogan of "everyone recycles, recycle everywhere" to overcome difficulties. 90% of the employees in the factory participated in the scrap metal recycling activities every day, rain or shine. Whoever recycles the most in the factory will be commended, but the employees have never been given bonuses. However, the Alloy Factory's achievements in recycling waste materials last year far exceeded many factories that issued waste material recycling rewards. When walking on the road, the employees would pick up even small pieces of metal the size of rice grains. They created many recycling methods such as reduction, water panning, and furnace digging, and recovered a total of 22 tons of mixed copper and mixed lead throughout the year.

After the Alloy Factory explained to the workers the situation that the country's cotton harvest was poor and the supply of cotton cloth was insufficient, activities to save labor protection supplies were immediately launched in the factory. Many workers in the alloy workshop brought their own needles and threads to work. Even if their gloves and work clothes were very torn, they were reluctant to throw them away and always sewed them up themselves. Worker Wang Fujun and his wife used their business time to wash and sew more than 200 pairs of gloves for the factory. Last year, the factory saved nearly 10,000 meters of cotton cloth.

Every time the Alloy Factory's sales personnel set off, the leading cadres would tell them the political significance of the sales work, requiring them to not only sell the products of their own factory, but also to understand and help various enterprises solve difficulties and be more considerate of others. Therefore, when the Alloy Factory's sales personnel are abroad, when they see that other units need technically complex alloys, and the factory cannot trial-produce them, or even lose money, they will never shirk their responsibility, but suggest that other units contact the Alloy Factory and overcome difficulties together. Sometimes, they even run errands for other factories to solve the difficulties of materials.

In the strong political atmosphere, in the Benxi Alloy Factory, you can often hear employees talking about national affairs, production, and learning technology, but you can't hear anyone talking about wages, welfare benefits, etc. Many advanced figures have emerged in the factory. The atmosphere of loving the factory as a home has been formed. In the event of strong winds and heavy rains, many workers often rush from home to the factory in the middle of the night to wait and avoid damage to equipment. During a fire, Communist Party member Huang Hongyi, in order to rescue the factory building, held a burning gasoline barrel and ran out of the workshop, burning his face and hands. In the hospital, he unwrapped the bandages on his face and fainted when he found his face was destroyed in the mirror. After returning to the factory, he overcame his inner pain and enthusiastically led his production team, becoming the most outstanding youth alloy team in the factory. A girl in the factory fell in love with Huang Hongyi's noble character. They established a happy family. The factory sent Huang Hongyi to the Soviet Red Cross Hospital in Beijing to undergo plastic surgery. When Huang Hongyi was discharged from the hospital, the Soviet doctor was deeply moved and said to him: "You are a good son of the Chinese people!"

The Benxi Alloy Factory, with politics in command, firmly adheres to the mass line and dares to create. Now it has become a bright banner of Liaoning Province in promoting the spirit of originality and "running enterprises diligently and thriftily." (Attached picture)

    独创风格的英雄工厂
    本报记者　徐家柱
    苏联冶金专家伊斯特林去年参观地方国营本溪合金厂时，看到这个穷工厂用最落后的土办法，炼出了许多贵重的合金，大为惊奇。他临走的时候，情不自禁地拥抱了厂长，说：“这座工厂是中国工人阶级的伟大创造！”
    本溪合金厂是白手起家的。1950年这个厂试办时，全部的生产设备是从沈阳借来的一口大锅、两把勺子和三个模子。当时只有四个工人，连厂房也没有。
    今天，本溪合金厂已经拥有六百名职工，能够炼出铜、铝、镍、铅等合金和精铜、电铜等贵重金属二百七十多种。它生产的许多国内独一无二的合金，遍销全国一千二百多个重要企业，同时还向朝鲜、越南和东南亚各地出口。本溪合金厂去年总产值已达四千二百多万元。根据目前订出的措施，今年总产值可以上升到一亿元以上，一跃成为煤铁之城——本溪市最大的工业企业之一。
    中共辽宁省委员会最近总结了这个厂以独创精神勤俭办企业的经验，认为这个厂是创家立业、高速度发展工业的生动榜样。
    “八卦炉”里出合金
    合金厂确是一座敢想、敢干，大胆创造出来的工厂。
    1950年建厂时，全厂懂得一点儿合金冶炼技术的，只有现任厂长苏新军一个人。他那时当技师，带领着一批工人睡在厂里，常常不眠不休地试炼合金。因为没有厂房，在露天作业，一下雨，熔化的金属遇上雨水，就会爆炸。他们只得抬着二、三十公斤的破铁板，挡住雨水，混身被淋得透湿。
    “没有厂房，青天当房盖；没有资金，到处拾破烂”，人们这样描绘着建厂初期的情景。这个厂大部分厂房是本厂职工自己修建起来的。开始，领导干部和群众一起，拾到一些旧木杆、旧木板、破草袋，再挖一点黄泥，就搭成了简易的泥厂房。炉灶逐渐增添起来以后，旧木板又捡不到，工人们就冒着严寒，时常在没有屋顶的木棚里炼合金。一般工厂的烟囱是用钢筋混凝土或者红砖筑成的。合金厂买不起这些材料，就收集了一批旧的臭油桶，焊成了七座相貌古怪的烟囱，节省了二十七万元。合金熔液高达摄氏一千多度，但修炉子需要的耐火材料又特别缺少。厂长就带领九个老工人到天津，学习修建我国古老的冶炼设备——八卦炉。有人曾经称呼合金厂领导干部和工人是“万能工人”。他们是冶炼工人，又兼作泥工、瓦工和木工。他们收集了旧砖和少量耐火材料，参考八卦炉的筑法，结合书本上的理论、开动脑筋，创造了各式各样的冶炼炉。开始修建电解铜的反射炉时，有人讽刺说：“你们能够炼出铜水，我就喝了它！”有的工人知道炼铜只有沈阳冶炼厂有反射炉，还有一个一百多公尺高的大烟囱，而自己几乎赤手空拳，没有材料，也没有高明的技术，对建炉没有信心。苏新军就向他们讲述了贺龙同志发动群众，用菜刀起家，创造了红色根据地的故事。路是人走出来的。大家反复试验，失败了也不罢休，最后没有花一分钱，用旧料修成了反射炉。出铜的时候，当初讲讽刺话的人，羞惭地走出了车间。
    合金厂从建厂开始到现在，总共只花了七十七万多元投资，而去年上缴给国家的利润就达五百八十多万元，还不到工厂一年内积累资金的零数。
    苏联专家伊斯特林在合金厂看到了任何教科书上也找不到的“土炉子”后，惊异不已：“谁能相信这些贵重的合金，是这样炼出来的！”他把工人们创建的冶炼炉，绘制了详细的图样，带到苏联去了。
    不惜赔本帮助别人
    合金厂在经营上也独具风格，这就是主动找上门去，为国营工业服务。
    解放前，我国需要的合金是依赖国外进口的。第一个五年计划期间，合金厂的产量和品种逐渐增多，但全国各地还很少知道本溪有一个合金工厂。合金厂就派人到北京参加一些专业会议，向到会的国营工厂代表散发产品目录和商品传单。为了节省国家外汇，合金厂还派专人到对外贸易部和进出口公司联系，发现本厂有条件生产的合金，而其他工厂又提出向国外订货的，就申请把订货承揽下来。大连造船公司原来提出要购买一批进口铜合金，合金厂在进出口公司知道后，马上主动和造船公司接洽，把这批订货从进口物资单中抽出来了。
    本溪合金厂这种作风是以社会主义协作思想为基础的。当合金厂知道其他工厂需要技术复杂的合金时，就不辞艰苦，一定要试制出来，常常赔本也在所不惜。去年，合金厂打听到大连造船公司急需一批镍合金，否则船只不能下水。开始，合金厂一部分同志感到试制镍合金成本高，工厂规模小，赔不起本。经过辩论，大家都觉得一个厂赔本是小事，整个造船工业发展是大事，就主动告诉造船公司，愿意试制镍合金。合金厂还常常不嫌麻烦地接受零星的订货，即使订购两、三公斤合金，也非常乐意地接受下来。一个很大的国营工厂三年没有试制成功的铝锰合金，合金厂也勇敢地试炼，终于用土办法冶炼成功了。因此，合金厂在许多工业企业中，享有很高的信誉。合金厂遇到本厂不能解决的困难，常常只要挂一个长途电话，其他单位就会立刻以人力、物力支援他们。
    在主动为国营工业服务的方针下，合金厂产品从开始时两种增加到二百七十多种，现在已被一些国营工厂称为合金工业中的“夜明珠”。
    不间断地大量试制新产品，使得合金厂职工经常遇到困难。但是，职工们时刻和国家当前的需要比较，感到工厂生产的合金，还远远不能满足国家的要求。因此，他们一直保持着高度的积极性。全厂有60％以上的工人省吃俭用，经常购买和阅读各种技术书籍，不少工人常常钻研到深夜。在大批新产品的试制过程中，合金厂培养出了二十一名技术员和二百五十多名技术工人。
    领导人从未离开工人区
    从1955年以来，合金厂的领导干部一直是像普通劳动者一样，在生产中领导生产，在群众中领导群众。
    1955年来，工厂试制新产品的任务繁重。每次试炼新合金，领导干部总是和工人一起在灼热的炉旁操作。领导干部常常“身先士卒”，带头执行最困难的任务。苏新军把铺盖带到厂里，一连几昼夜不停地试炼，有时困极了，就在炉旁铺上草袋，在洒满了金属渣子的棉被里打一会儿盹。领导干部长期参加生产，也熟悉了本行的技术。厂长苏新军已是厂内最有经验的技师。副厂长葛连生1955年到厂开始学习炼合金。现在全厂约有一半产品，可以由他担任技术指导。
    合金厂领导干部八年来没有搬出过工人住宅区。他们和工人们一起住过古庙。前年，本溪市工业局想给合金厂干部修建楼房做宿舍。合金厂领导干部不同意，他们主张修盖造价较低的平房，和工人们一起居住。他们用削减宿舍造价节省下来的钱，修建了工厂极需的化验室。平房盖成后，领导干部就和职工们在一起，以一个普通工人的身份，共同讨论怎样分配宿舍。去年，党总支书记张四维利用假日和业余时间，带领一批职工义务劳动。他们挖地基、抬石头、砌泥墙，为缺房子的工人盖成了三十八户住宅。张四维还时常到独身工人宿舍去，帮助打扫屋子。苏新军、张四维等人长期住在工人区里，很容易发现工人生活中的大小问题。他们发现厂内厕所不够用，党总支书记就带头在工人活动地点的附近，盖了厕所。他们对工人家属的生活也关心。他们发现工人的子女上学的时候经过的山路崎岖难行，就带头在山上开辟了一条盘山大道。
    在合金厂很少见到有人不合理地闹工资、闹房子，即使偶然发生，也会被职工们认为是一桩怪事。有的工人说：“刚进合金厂，看到什么都是破破烂烂的，福利待遇又低，就想到国营工厂去工作。可是，一看见领导干部不分早晚，和大家一起干活，就不想再离开了！”
    浓厚的政治空气
    合金厂发动群众克服困难，是以政治思想工作打先锋的。工厂领导干部都有这样的体会：“有事和群众商量就会找到千万条锦囊妙计”。
    前年，国家缺少焦炭，合金厂又必须用焦炭冶炼合金。工厂就向职工群众说明：厂里焦炭异常缺乏，如果想不出解决的办法，合金炼不出来，就会影响许多重要工业部门的生产。许多工人知道了这件事的政治意义，就连夜想办法。在两、三天内，全厂就出现了许多节约焦炭的技术方案。最后，工人们修建成功一种新的地下反射炉，可以完全用煤代替焦炭当燃料，保证了工厂正常生产。
    本溪合金厂决不以单纯的经济观点来动员群众。合金厂几年来一直是在原料缺乏的情况下坚持生产的。厂里提出“人人回收、处处回收”来克服困难的口号。全厂有90％的职工，每天都风雨无阻地参加了废金属回收活动。厂里谁回收得多，就表扬谁，但从来也没有向职工发过奖金。可是，合金厂去年回收废料的成绩，却远远超过了许多发废料回收奖励费的工厂。职工们走在路上，看到米粒一般大的金属小块，也要拾起来。他们创造了还原、水淘、扒炉等许多回收方法，全年拣回了杂铜、杂铅共二十二吨。
    合金厂向工人说清了国家棉花歉收，棉布供应不足的情况后，节约劳动保护用品的活动，立刻在全厂开展起来。合金车间很多工人都自带针线上班，手套和作业服破烂得很，也舍不得扔掉，总是自己缝补好。工人王福君和爱人利用业务时间，为工厂洗缝了二百多副手套。去年全厂共节约了近一万公尺棉布。
    合金厂推销人员每次出发的时候，领导干部都向他们讲述推销工作的政治意义，要求他们不光推销自己的工厂的产品，还要了解和帮助各个企业解决困难，多体谅别人。因此，合金厂推销人员在外，看到其他单位需要技术复杂的合金，本厂又不能试制，甚至要赔本，也决不推托，而是建议其他单位和合金厂联系，共同克服困难。有时，他们甚至替别的工厂到处跑腿，解决材料的困难。
    在浓厚的政治空气中，在本溪合金厂经常可以听到职工群众在谈国家大事，谈生产，谈学习技术，但听不到有人谈工资，谈福利待遇等事情。全厂涌现了许许多多先进人物。爱厂如家已形成风气。遇到大风大雨的天气，不少工人经常半夜从家里赶来，到厂里守候，以避免损失器材。共产党员黄洪义在一次火灾中，为了抢救厂房，抱着燃烧着的汽油桶，从车间里奔出来，把脸部和双手都烧坏了。在医院里，他解开了脸上的绷带，在镜子中发现自己的面貌被毁，就晕了过去。回厂后，他战胜了内心的痛苦，热情地领导自己的生产班，成为全厂最出色的青年合金班。厂里一位姑娘爱上了黄洪义高贵的品德。他们建立了幸福的家庭。工厂把黄洪义送到北京苏联红十字医院，施行了整形外科手术。黄洪义出院时，苏联大夫深受感动，对他说：“你是中国人民的好儿子！”
    本溪合金厂以政治为统帅，坚定地走群众路线，大胆创造，现在已成为辽宁省发扬独创精神，“勤俭办企业”的一面鲜明的旗帜。（附图片）
