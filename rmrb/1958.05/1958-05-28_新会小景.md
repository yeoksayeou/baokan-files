Scenery of Xinhui
Han Beiping Poem Yu Feng Painting

The work in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, has been successful in all aspects, attracting people from all over to visit. We were also moved during our visit and hoped to reflect its new outlook from a few ordinary perspectives, which led to this set of short poems and paintings.

Weaving sunflower mats, green banana trees, yellow oranges, towering Livistona chinensis, fragrant pineapples, the girl lives by the small river; she planted the small sunflower tree as a child, and now the sunflower leaves are sharp and long. Pick the sunflower leaves to make fans, sending a cool breeze in the hot June; weave mats to send to faraway places, with good patterns, deep affection, and a piece of sincere care hidden in the center of the mat.

    新会小景
    韩北屏　诗  郁风　画
    广东省新会县的各项工作，都做出成绩，吸引各地的人去参观。我们去访问时，也受到感动，希望从几个平凡的侧面，反映出它的新风貌，于是产生了这一组小诗和画。
    织葵席芭蕉绿，橙子黄，桄榔冲天菠萝香，姑娘家住在小河旁；儿时种下小葵树，如今葵叶尖来葵叶长。摘下葵叶作扇子，暑天六月送风凉；织成席子寄远方，图样好，情意深，一片殷勤藏在席中央。（附图片）
