Not Just Contacting the Masses
By Our Correspondent Cao Baoming

Starting from the "Ribbon-Cutting"
Some time ago, workers at the Huangshi Power Plant held a "test run ceremony" for a newly manufactured coal feeder, inviting leading cadres to "cut the ribbon." At the time, no one was willing to go, so the Party Secretary, Xia Hanqing, had to bite the bullet and "enjoy" this "honor." He cut the red silk in the midst of the chaotic crowd, only to discover that the coal feeder took a quarter of an hour to load a car of coal, which was less efficient than manual labor (in the past, it took only two people five minutes to load one car manually). Xia Hanqing was quite embarrassed by this, and more than thirty big-character poster "reporters" surrounded him, asking him to "make a statement."

This coal feeder was made by the factory leadership to reduce the physical labor of the workers. However, they did not educate the technical personnel to study together with the workers, nor did they carefully review the drawings. As a result, they spent two thousand yuan to manufacture something that was not suitable. Therefore, the workers came up with this "ribbon-cutting" method to criticize the leaders: if you don't overcome bureaucratic work style, even good intentions will not produce good results!

As a result, the Party Committee decided to completely change its leadership style, move into the collective dormitory, live and eat with the workers, and take on work shifts to carry out "experimental horizontal shifts."

After Going Down the Mountain and Out of the Office Building
One evening, not long after Xia Hanqing moved into the workers' dormitory, electrician Wu Qiuting met him in the corridor and told him, "The porcelain bottles of the high-voltage substation have a serious accumulation of dust, and there have been discharges during light rain. If they are not cleaned, a major accident may occur." Xia Hanqing was previously a grade six fitter and understood the significance of this matter. The next day, he went to the substation to inspect, and immediately discussed with the administration to take temporary measures of "live washing." Later, they planned a partial power outage to thoroughly clean the bottles, ensuring safe power transmission. He later asked Wu Qiuting, "Why didn't you report such a problem before?" Wu Qiuting smiled and said, "Before, you lived on the mountain, and sometimes when we went to find you, you were in a meeting, which was quite awkward. Anyway, there are special personnel responsible for production, so we were too lazy to report it. Now that you've moved down the mountain to live with us, we can talk whenever we meet."

Another day, the No. 5 water pump suddenly malfunctioned and would not turn. Some of the on-duty workers believed, "It's difficult to find the problem without completely disassembling it." However, this would not be able to meet the peak load at that time, which would cause a temporary power outage. At this time, Yang Fuchao, the deputy director of production, who insisted on the half-day on-site work system, was on-site to understand the situation and immediately analyzed the cause of the fault with the workers. Yang Fuchao was originally an eighth-grade worker with rich production experience. He quickly helped the workers find the problem, and it took only thirty-five minutes to restart the machine, ensuring safe operation. Yang Fuchao recalled, "In the past, when dealing with problems in the office building, if something like this happened below, it all depended on writing work orders and reporting them level by level, which would take two hours back and forth. We couldn't pinpoint the problem in the office. If the machine was really completely disassembled, it would take ten hours to deal with it, and a temporary power outage would be inevitable."

A Rationalization Proposal
Liu Tangsen, the water supply team leader of the second horizontal shift, made a rationalization proposal to technician Li Xiangsheng: the factory often starts two units, using two water pumps to supply water. He calculated that during low load at night (within 8,000 kilowatts), one water pump could supply two units. "Combining" them and opening one less water pump could save electricity within the plant. However, Li Xiangsheng shook his head and said, "Don't daydream. The temperatures of the condensate from the two units are different. When hot and cold water meet, it will cause impact in the pipes and cause accidents." Liu Tangsen was very unhappy with the technician's attitude and said, "The rectification is still like this!" He planned to submit the suggestion to the leadership four more times. If the leadership did not actively support it, then he would not submit it again. Who knew that as soon as he submitted the suggestion to the Party branch secretary Wu Liangchen, Wu Liangchen, along with the Party Secretary and the engineer, went to the shift at night to conduct on-site testing, with technician Li Xiangsheng serving as the chief commander and Liu Tangsen as the technical guide, and the leading cadres making operation records. The suggestion was successfully tested on the spot that night. Li Xiangsheng then shook Liu Tangsen's hand tightly and said, "This test has given me a great education. I didn't support your suggestion, I'm really sorry!" They then held an on-site meeting to assess the economic value of the suggestion and set out a promotion plan.

Who knew that Zuo Ziyuan, the water supply team leader of the third horizontal shift, thought that Liu Tangsen and he were both grade six workers, generally equal, and refused to learn from Liu Tangsen's experience, but wanted to do his own thing. As a result, his operation was not right. The temperature difference between the condensate of the two units was too large, and a cold shock occurred in the pipe, which almost blew open the "flange," causing an accident. The second night, the leadership wanted Liu Tangsen to go to the third horizontal shift to guide, but Zuo Ziyuan pretended to be sick and asked for leave from work. Party branch secretary Wu Liangchen discovered this problem in the shift and immediately went to the dormitory to persuade Zuo Ziyuan to study together before promoting it in the third horizontal shift. Zuo Ziyuan later reviewed and said, "The problem lies in not being willing to humbly learn from others."

This suggestion was promoted throughout the factory in half a month, saving 360 kilowatt-hours of electricity per day. In the past, if leading cadres did not work with the shifts and could not find problems in time, it would be difficult to say when this suggestion could be realized and when it could be fully promoted.

Both Upper and Lower Levels Change Their Work Styles
Recently, Xia Hanqing and Yang Fuchao and others went to the Huagang Power Plant to participate in electrical testing and encountered them cleaning ash. Wang Zongying, a twenty-year-old electrician, asked, "Secretary Xia, what are you doing here?" Xia Hanqing said, "Doing tests." "Participating in labor?" "Of course, we all work with the shifts, doing all kinds of work." "That's good! You have to make a decisive decision, immediately take off your coat, put on work clothes, and go with us to the most difficult place!" Song Delong, the chairman of the power plant's trade union, also said next to him, "Yes, Secretary, go with us to the most difficult place to experience life, take action immediately." Wang Zongying, Xia Hanqing, and Song Delong climbed into the furnace flue one after another. Wang Zongying asked as he climbed, "Is this your first time coming in?" Xia Hanqing said, "It's the first time." Song Delong continued, "The first to crawl in was Director Yuan (referring to Yuan Zhizhou, the director of the power plant)." During the cleaning of ash in the main steam drum, Wang Zongying introduced the situation while commenting, "Your coming in shows that the leadership has changed its work style and is working with the masses. In the past, our technicians didn't do this ash-cleaning work either. Now we are also changing our style. We must not only do technical work well, but also do ordinary labor well. If we clean the ash ourselves more cleanly, the efficiency of the machine will be higher." He also pointed to the female electrician cleaning ash on the lower level and said, "Look how enthusiastically she is working."

This reminded Xia Hanqing of when they first worked with the shifts, some young workers hid upstairs in the dormitory building to watch. After watching for a few days, female stoker Yu Baohua said to others, "In the past, I always thought that leading cadres talked a lot and did little. Now they are all going in to coal and clean ash, getting their faces and hands covered in dirt, and then attending shift meetings. What about myself? I have to wash my hands and apply some vanishing cream even after sweeping the floor." Leading cadres participating in labor changed the atmosphere of the entire factory. In the past, the mud removal project in the riverside pumping station was all done by hired temporary workers. This time, the workers automatically formed two shock teams, proposing to fight against the severe cold with the spirit of Paul's road construction, ensuring the early completion of the mud removal project. They took the time to complete the project, saving five thousand yuan.

Some people still think that implementing "three togethers" in factories can only play a role in contacting the masses and has little effect on production. The experience of the Huangshi Power Plant refutes this argument: when leaders are closely integrated with the masses, they become a huge force in production, which can prevent accidents and improve production at any time.

    不只是联系群众
    本报记者　曹葆铭
    从“剪彩”说起
    前些日子，黄石电厂的工人为新制的进煤机举办“试车典礼”，请领导干部去“剪彩”。当时，谁都不肯去，党委书记夏汉卿只好自己硬着头皮去“享受”这分“光荣”。他在乱哄哄的人群中，剪开红绸，就发现进煤机要一刻钟才能装完一车煤，效率比人工还低（过去全用人工，只要两个人五分钟能装完），夏汉卿正为这事很窘，三十多个大字报的“记者”却围了上来，请他“发表谈话”。
    这个进煤机是工厂领导上为减轻工人体力劳动而自制的。但他们没有教育技术人员跟工人共同研究，也没有仔细审查图纸，结果花了两千元制造出来不适用。因此，工人们就想出这个“剪彩”的办法来批评领导：如果不克服官僚主义作风，有好心也得不出好效果！
    于是，党委决心彻底转变领导作风，搬进集体宿舍，与工人同住、同吃，并分工跟班劳动，搞“试验横班”。
    下山下楼以后
    一个晚上，夏汉卿刚搬进工人宿舍不久，电工吴秋廷在走廊上遇见他，便向他讲：“高压变电所的瓷瓶积灰很严重，已经有下小雨放电的现象，再不清洗，可能出大事故。”夏汉卿以前是个六级钳工，了解这件事的重大意义。他第二天便去变电所检查，当场就和行政研究，采取了“带电冲洗”的临时措施，后来又有计划地部分停电，彻底清洗一番，确保了安全送电。他后来问吴秋廷：“这样的问题，你以前为什么不反映？”吴秋廷笑了笑说：“以前你们住在山上，有时去找你们，又碰上你们开会，怪别扭。反正生产上有专人负责，也就懒得反映。现时搬下山来住在一起，什么时候碰见，就什么时候谈。”
    另一天，五号水泵突然发生故障，转不动。有的值班工人认为：“不全部拆开，很难找出毛病。”但这样就不能适应当时的高峰负荷，会造成临时停电事故。这时，生产副厂长杨福潮坚持半日下现场的工作制度，正在现场了解情况，马上就同工人们一起分析故障原因。杨福潮原是个八级工人，生产经验丰富，他很快就帮助工人找出毛病，只花三十五分钟就使机器重新开动，保证了安全运行。杨福潮回忆说：“过去在楼上办公室处理问题，下面遇到这样的事全靠写工作票按级上报，往返就得两小时。在办公室里不能把问题闹准，如果真把机器全部拆开，就得十小时才能处理好，非临时停电不可。”
    一项合理化建议
    二横班给水组长刘棠森向技术员李祥生提了一项合理化建议：工厂经常开动两个机组，用两个水泵给水。他计算了一下，在深夜低负荷（八千瓩以内）的时候，一台水泵就可供给两个机组，这样“并”起来少开一台水泵，能节省厂内用电。但是，李祥生却摇头说：“你别空想心思了。两个机组的凝结水的温度不一样，冷热水遇在一起，会在管子里发生冲击，造成事故。”刘棠森见技术员这样的态度，心里很不高兴，说：“现时整风还这样！”他准备向领导再提四次，如果领导不积极支持，那末就再不提了。谁知他刚向总支书记吴良臣提出这个建议，吴良臣便同党委书记、工程师深夜去班上进行现场试验，由技术员李祥生担任总指挥、刘棠森任技术指导，领导干部作操作记录。这个建议当夜就在现场上试验成功了。李祥生这时紧握着刘棠森的手说：“这次试验给我的教育很大。我没支持你的建议，真对不起！”他们接着又开现场会议，鉴定这个建议的经济价值，并订出推广办法。
    谁知三横班的给水组长左自元却认为刘棠森和他都是六级工，一般高，不肯学刘棠森的经验，而想自己另搞一套。结果，他的操作不对头，两个机组的凝结水的温度相差太大，在管子里发生冷冲击，差点将“珐兰”冲开，酿成事故。第二夜，领导上要刘棠森去三横班指导，左自元就装病请假不上班。总支书吴良臣在班上发现这个问题，又立即去宿舍说服左自元一起研究，才在三横班推广开。左自元事后检查说：“毛病就出在不肯虚心请教别人。”
    这个建议半个月就在全厂推广了，每天能节省用电三百六十度。如在过去，领导干部不随班工作，不能及时发现问题，这个建议何时能实现，何时能全面推广，就很难说了。
    上下都改变作风
    最近，夏汉卿和杨福潮等去华钢发电所参加电气试验，碰上那边正在清灰。二十来岁的电工王宗英问道：“夏书记，你们来干啥？”夏汉卿说：“搞试验。”“参不参加劳动？”“当然参加，我们都是随班劳动，啥活都干。”“那好！你要当机立断，马上脱下大衣，穿上工作服，跟我们一起到最艰苦的地方去！”发电所的工会主席宋德龙也在旁边说：“对，书记跟我们到最艰苦的地方去体验生活，马上行动。”王宗英、夏汉卿和宋德龙三人便顺序爬进炉通管去。王宗英一边爬一边问：“你是第一次进来吧？”夏汉卿说：“是第一次。”宋德龙又接着说：“第一个钻进来的还是袁主任（指发电所主任袁志洲）。”在总汽包清灰中，王宗英一边介绍情况，一边发表议论：“你们进来，说明领导转变作风，和群众同劳动。我们技工过去也不干这清灰的活儿，现在也是转变风气，不仅要作好技术活，还要做好普通出力的活。自己清灰清得干净些，机器效率也高些。”他还指着在下面一层清灰的女电工说：“你们看她干得多起劲。”
    这使夏汉卿想起他们刚跟班劳动的时候，有些青工躲在宿舍楼上观看。观看了几天以后，女司炉余宝华向人说：“我过去总以为领导干部说的多，做的少，现在都是进煤清灰，搞得满脸满手污黑，就参加班后会议。我自己呢？扫一下地，也要忙着洗手，擦点雪花膏。”领导干部参加劳动，转变了全厂的风气。江边水泵房的除泥工程过去都是雇临时工干，工人们这次却自动成立了两个突击队，提出以保尔筑路的精神，与严寒作斗争，保证提前完成除泥工程，抽时间把这工程搞完了，节约了五千元。
    有些人至今以为在工厂中实行“三同”，只能起个联系群众的作用，对生产的作用不大。黄石电厂的经验就批判了这种论调：领导与群众密切结合起来，就变成了生产上的一股巨大力量，能随时预防事故，改进生产。（附图片）
