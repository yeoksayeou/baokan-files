    Using Science and Technology to Support Industrial and Agricultural Production
    Harbin Universities and Colleges Link Up with Production Departments
    Yangzhou Science and Technology Workers Collaborate with Factories and Agricultural Cooperatives
    This newspaper reports that collaboration between universities and colleges in Harbin and production departments, as well as collaboration among the schools themselves, is becoming more widespread and gradually forming a trend.
    Since implementing the policy of combining education with production, Harbin University of Technology, Northeast Agricultural College, and Northeast Forestry College, among others, have attached greater importance to collaboration with production departments than in the past. Teachers and students from various schools have actively stepped out of the campus to establish connections with factories, agricultural cooperatives, and forest farms, and to sign collaboration contracts. On the one hand, teachers and students use scientific and technological theories to support industrial and agricultural production; on the other hand, they learn practical knowledge through production practice, enrich themselves, and improve teaching and scientific research work, reversing the past phenomenon of serious detachment from reality and the masses. Harbin University of Technology organized teachers from teaching and research offices and laboratories to visit factories, and the Harbin Municipal Bureau of Industry also organized more than forty factory负责人 [responsible persons] to visit the university. Both the school and the factory sides believe that the factory should be regarded as the school's laboratory, and the school should be regarded as the factory's research institute. Various schools have established cooperative relations with twenty-eight factories, mainly to help them design and manufacture new products, carry out technological transformation, and jointly study specialized problems in production.
    Northeast Agricultural College has established close cooperative relationships with many agricultural cooperatives. Professors and lecturers from the Department of Agronomy formed five professional guidance groups for dry land, paddy fields, horticulture, plants, and soil and fertilizer, to provide production technical guidance to agricultural cooperatives such as "Jin Xing," "Shi Yi," "Qian Jin," and "Xiang Fang." Each group has launched technical guidance activities in the cooperatives such as wheat sowing and seed disinfection. The Department of Agricultural Machinery designed and modified six types of agricultural machinery for the agricultural cooperatives and conducted trial production. The department also formed an agricultural machinery repair factory, planning to repair two hundred to four hundred agricultural machines annually, and is preparing to train technicians for agricultural cooperatives to repair farm implements.
    Northeast Forestry College signed an agreement with the Jilin Forestry Industry Department to do the overall design of two forestry enterprises for the department, and to carry out surveying and design of two hundred kilometers of forest railways. More than two hundred and thirty teachers and students participated, and have now begun work.
    Among the collaborations between various universities and colleges, an important recent activity is: the Harbin Municipal Party Committee's Department of Culture and Education convened a meeting of the directors of political theory teaching and research offices of seven universities and colleges in the city. At the meeting, everyone agreed that collaboration in political theory teaching was very important, and advocated starting collaboration immediately, and made an agreement on the spot. The agreement stipulates that each school will exchange plans and teaching materials for socialist education courses, exchange experiences regularly, notify each other of important activities such as holding large-scale debates, provide mutual support in manpower, share and substitute for classes, establish a learning and research system for political theory teachers, and establish a collaboration group, etc. The meeting also decided to invite leading comrades from the provincial and municipal party committees to serve as part-time teachers in various schools.
    This newspaper reports that after the rectification campaign, the scientific and technological circles in Yangzhou City, Jiangsu Province, have taken practical actions to support agricultural production.
    Wang Rong, professor of agricultural machinery at Subei Agricultural College, helped the Yangzhou Iron Factory to make "middle tiller" (three-tooth cultivator) and "nail tooth harrow," and personally went to Jiangdu County to teach fifty young students to drive tractors. He also continues to take two and a half days each week to assist the Iron Factory in manufacturing various new types of agricultural tools planned for this year and the modification and design of agricultural tools. Cao Yinliang, chief engineer of Yangzhou Zhenyang Power Plant, and other engineering and technical personnel have come up with ways to tap the potential of generators to support the expansion of 26,000 mu of fields for electric irrigation in the suburbs and neighboring counties. Gu Xuecheng, deputy director of the analytical chemistry specialty of Yangzhou Construction Engineering School, and the teachers and students of the chemistry department, jointly researched and established a bacterial fertilizer factory in the school to produce "nitrogen-fixing bacterial agent," "soybean rhizobium agent," and "peanut rhizobium agent."
    In order to provide technical guidance in agricultural production and livestock veterinary medicine, and to ensure the realization of agricultural production increase targets, scientific and technical personnel from Subei Agricultural College, Yangzhou Agricultural School, and Jiangsu Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences have signed contracts with seven agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Yangzhou. They often help agricultural cooperatives formulate technical measures in production and carry out cattle and pig livestock maintenance and prevention work. For example, teachers from the Microbiology and Pharmacology Teaching and Research Group of Subei Agricultural College manufactured 3,000 ml of rabbit-adapted swine fever vaccine for the prevention of swine fever in forty agricultural cooperatives in the suburbs of Yangzhou and some cooperatives in Hanjiang County, and have gone to the agricultural cooperatives to help with injections. Many scientific and technical personnel have also rushed to areas outside Yangzhou to support agricultural production. (Xue Qingling)

    用科学技术支援工农业生产
    哈尔滨各高等学校与生产部门挂钩
    扬州科学技术工作者同工厂、农业社协作
    本报讯　哈尔滨各高等学校与生产部门的协作和各校相互之间的协作，愈来愈广泛，逐渐形成风气。
    哈尔滨工业大学、东北农学院和东北林学院等校，自贯彻执行教育与生产相结合方针以来，比过去更加重视与生产部门的协作了。各校师生纷纷走出校门，主动地找工厂、农业社、林场建立联系，订立协作合同。师生们一方面用科学技术理论支援工农业生产，一方面通过生产实践学习实际知识，充实自己，改进教学和科学研究工作，扭转过去严重脱离实际脱离群众的现象。哈尔滨工业大学组织了教研室和实验室的教师到工厂去参观，哈尔滨市工业局也组织了四十多个工厂负责人参观学校。学校和工厂两方面都认为，应该把工厂作为学校的实验室，把学校作为工厂的研究室。各学校已经同二十八个工厂建立了协作关系，主要是帮助它们设计和制造新产品，进行技术改造，同时合作研究生产中的专门问题。
    东北农学院和不少农业社建立了密切的协作关系。农学系的教授、讲师组成了旱田、水田、园艺、植物、土肥等五个专业指导组，到“金星”、“十一”、“前进”、“香坊”等农业社进行生产技术指导。各组已在社里展开小麦播种、种子消毒等等技术指导的活动。农机系为农业社设计和改装六种农业机械，并且进行试制。该系还组成一个农业机械修理工厂，计划每年修理二百到四百台农业机械，而且准备为农业社培养修理农具的技工。
    东北林学院与吉林森林工业部订了协议书，为该部做两个林业企业的总体设计，进行二百公里森林铁路的勘测和设计，参加的师生有二百三十多人，现在已开始行动。
    各高等学校互相之间的协作，最近有一项重要的活动，就是：中共哈尔滨市委文教部召集全市七个高等院校的政治课教研室主任开会。会上，大家一致认为政治课教学上的协作十分重要，主张立即开始协作，并且当场作出了协议书。协议书规定，各校交换社会主义教育课的计划和教材，经常交流经验，有重要的活动，如举行大辩论会，互相通知，人力上互相支援，互相兼课、代课，建立政治课教师的学习研究制度，成立协作小组，等等。会议还决定请省市委领导同志分别到各校兼课。
    本报讯　江苏省扬州市科学技术界经过整风运动以后，纷纷用实际行动支援农业生产。
    苏北农学院农业机械教授王荣，帮助扬州铁工厂制成“中耕机”（三齿耘锄）、“钉齿耙”，又亲自跑到江都县教五十个青年学生学会了驾驶拖拉机，而且还继续每星期抽出两个半天的时间协助铁工厂制造今年计划制成的各种新式农具和农具的改装设计等工作。扬州振扬电厂曹寅亮总工程师和其他工程技术人员，已经想出办法挖掘了发电机的潜力，支援郊区和邻县扩建的二万六千亩田的电力灌溉。扬州建筑工程学校分析化学专业科副主任顾学成和化学科师生共同研究，在该校设立了一个细菌肥料厂，生产“固氮菌剂”、“大豆根瘤菌剂”和“花生根瘤菌剂”。
    为了在农业生产上和牲畜兽医方面给予技术指导，保证农业增产指标的实现，苏北农学院、扬州农业学校以及江苏省农业科学研究所的科学技术人员，已经同扬州郊区的七个农业社订立了合同。他们经常帮助农业社在生产上订技术措施和进行牛猪牲畜保养预防的工作。如苏北农学院微生物药理教研组的教师们，制造了猪瘟兔化疫苗三千毫升，供扬州郊区四十个农业社和邗江县部分社预防猪瘟用，并且已经到农业社帮助注射。还有不少科学技术人员奔赴扬州以外的地区，支援农业生产。　（薛庆龄）
