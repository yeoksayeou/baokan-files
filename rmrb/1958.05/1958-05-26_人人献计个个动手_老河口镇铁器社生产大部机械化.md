    Everyone Contributes Ideas, Everyone Takes Action
    Laokouzhen Hardware Cooperative Achieves Mostly Mechanized Production
    (Our newspaper, Wuhan, May 25th) The Laokouzhen Hardware Production Cooperative in Guanghua County, Hubei Province, relying on the masses to improve tools and innovate technology, has increased the degree of mechanization and semi-mechanization of the production process from the original 30% to 71%, setting an example for hardware production cooperatives and small farm tool factories to gradually achieve mechanization.
    The Laokouzhen Hardware Production Cooperative has a total of 209 people. Originally, it had only a 24-horsepower power engine, a drilling machine, six old lathes, and two hand drills. It could only produce general farm tools such as plows, hoes, and sickles. About 70% of the production process was manual. Since late January this year, under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the cooperative members have broken with conservative ideas, boldly created and innovated technology, with everyone contributing ideas and everyone taking action. They used old tools and waste materials to produce 13 kinds of mechanical tools, large and small, such as screw lathes, planers, and belt hammers. These tools are four to ten times more efficient than the original manual operations. They spent only 867 yuan to greatly change the production outlook of the entire cooperative, with 71% of the production of various products being done mechanically. In just three months, they produced 11 kinds of new-style farm tools, such as cotton soil loosening tools, paddy field weeding tools, and wooden double-shared plows. At the end of April, they also successfully assembled a tractor using an old car head. They are now trial-producing a single-cylinder horizontal diesel engine. The total output value of this cooperative from January to April this year increased by 1.8 times compared to the same period last year, equivalent to 80% of the total output value of last year.
    Currently, this hardware cooperative is continuing to reform tools and trial-produce new products, striving to complete a total output value of 738,000 yuan this year.

    人人献计个个动手
    老河口镇铁器社生产大部机械化
    本报武汉25日电　湖北省光化县老河口镇铁器生产合作社，依靠群众改良工具，革新技术，使生产过程的机械和半机械化程度由原来的30％增加到71％，为铁器生产合作社和小型农具厂逐步实现机械化作出了榜样。
    老河口铁器生产合作社共二百零九人，原来只有一部二十四马力的动力机、一部钻床、六部旧车床和两个手摇钻等少量机器，只能生产犁、锄、镰刀等一般农具，生产过程中有70％左右是手工操作。今年1月下旬以来，社员们在大跃进形势下，打破了保守思想，大胆创造、革新技术，人人献计，个个动手，利用旧工具、废材料配制了螺丝床、刨床、皮带锤等大小机械工具十三种。这些工具较原来手工操作效率提高四倍到十多倍。他们只花了八百六十七元，就使全社的生产面貌大大改变，在生产各种产品过程中71％都可以用机械生产。短短三个月中，他们生产了棉花松土器、水田锄草器、木制双铧犁等新式农具十一种。在4月底，他们还利用一台旧汽车头装配成功一辆拖拉机。现在，他们正在试制独缸卧式柴油机。这个社今年1月至4月的总产值比去年同时期增长了一点八倍，相当于去年全年总产值的80％。
    目前，这个铁器社正在继续改革工具，试制新产品，为争取今年完成总产值七十三万八千元而努力。
