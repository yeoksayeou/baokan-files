    One Day in Qingyan Township
    Jian Xian'ai
    The public bus went over Tongmu Ridge, down a slope and up another, sometimes advancing in a small rain-like cloud of dust. After an hour and a half, we saw Qingyan Bridge. On both sides of the archway were written eight large, eye-catching characters: "Advancing is glorious, being sluggish is shameful." A group of farmers were busy pulling river sand with horse-drawn carts beside the bridge. On the boundless field, how many teams were scattered, drawing water and plowing the fields! Rows of brand-new, tall houses stood along the roads and slopes of North Village and East Village, flashing past before our eyes.
    Getting off the bus and stepping into Qingyan Township, which I had been away from for two years, the first thing that caught my attention was how clean the streets were swept, with "Clean" small paper slips posted on every household door. In front of several houses, there were even elderly people and women sweeping the ground diligently. The offices, supply and marketing cooperatives, agricultural cooperatives, farm implement factories, and purchasing stations along the street had all been fitted with electric lights, and the silhouettes of the lights could be seen from outside. I remembered that when the primary cooperatives were first established, the farmers in Qingyan generally used vegetable oil lamps and tung oil lamps, and even kerosene lamps were rare; a batch of kerosene lamps that the supply and marketing cooperative brought in had been sitting on top of the counter collecting dust. How could it suddenly have advanced so quickly? I greeted an old farmer who was sweeping the floor:
    "Old comrade, have you installed electric lights? That's really amazing!"
    "This is nothing!" The old man with a blue cloth turban straightened his back, one hand resting on the long broom handle, his sun-darkened face flashing a smile, glanced at me, and snorted. "This is a small power plant, only supplying electricity for two hundred lamps, how could that be enough! We are also preparing to build a larger plant. Now with the leadership of the Communist Party, construction is even greater than the abilities of immortals."
    At the district committee, it was as if a wedding was being celebrated. The walls were plastered everywhere with red paper written with celebratory reports, proposals, and challenge letters from the Communist Youth League branch, agricultural cooperatives, iron and wood cooperatives, and so on. The handicraftsmen and farmers had made a list of the homemade machines they had painstakingly created during the Great Leap Forward, and many of the novel names were ones I had never heard of: what five-row seeders, roller-type nail-toothed harrows, suspended bow-type water pumps, granular fertilizer hand-cranked machines, etc. Some of the names of the items are no longer clear.
    Two district committee secretaries had both come to the township: the secretary was there to give a report at the women cadres' meeting; the deputy secretary was probably there to inspect production, and was talking with a cadre from the municipal party committee's rural work department. The party secretary of the large township was also chairing a small meeting, discussing with several farmers how to develop Qingyan's vegetable industry. Not wanting to disturb them, I took this opportunity to stroll in the courtyard, reading in order the dazzling big-character posters.
    It wasn't until after lunch that the party secretary of the large township took advantage of the break to briefly talk to me about the recent situation of the Qingyan Agricultural Cooperative: new-style farm tools were already in widespread use; the farmers had all learned triangular close planting; teams had all established their own nurseries; in addition to each household raising an average of two pigs, the cooperative had also built new-style pigsties for collective pig raising (already raising dozens of piglets); new fish ponds and chicken farms had been built; several kinds of sideline businesses had been developed; they had learned to manufacture chemical fertilizers and feed; a very long flood drainage ditch had been dug; and the road network between villages and hamlets had basically been completed. The Buyi ethnic group party secretary, who came from a peasant background, spoke with great enthusiasm; I listened with relish, and involuntarily danced with joy. He finally told me: "Our township has been assigned to the suburbs of Guiyang City, and everyone should think more about serving the city in the future. With this division, the farmers are all happy, and their production enthusiasm is unprecedented, feeling that the leap forward will be faster. Even though the higher authorities only require a yield of 800 jin per mu, we still have to put in our effort and ingenuity to strive for 1,000 jin per mu. The enthusiasm for technological innovation is also greater."
    Later, I went to the township people's committee to sit in on a women cadres' meeting of more than twenty townships convened by the district. More than fifty people attended the meeting, most of whom were female township heads and female cooperative directors, and some also concurrently served as party branch secretaries. There were Miao, Buyi, and Han ethnic groups. There were older, experienced cadres, and also young girls who were growing up. Although their dress was different, they had one thing in common: cleanliness and simplicity. I had attended many similar meetings since the land reform. In the past, during meetings, there were always a few people who didn't pay much attention to listening to the report, and liked to "hold small meetings" below, doze off, twist hemp rope, or sew soles; some even brought very young children to the meeting, causing them to cry and make noise. This time, the situation really refreshed me: every representative was energetic, not only listening to the report quietly, but also quite a few were taking notes, and remembering them not slowly. Thanks to the reliable nurseries, the children were not brought along.
    I followed them to visit the Qingyan Agricultural Cooperative's granular fertilizer factory, hotbed seedling cultivation, simple pigsties, new-style rice paddies, fish ponds, and nurseries. When we arrived at the rice paddy, we saw some female cooperative members transplanting triangular seedlings there, and they all raised their hands and cheered. "It's not enough to just listen with your ears and look with your eyes, you should try planting it yourself!" Saying that, several young women took the lead, followed by the old women, immediately took off their shoes, rolled up their trouser legs, rolled up their sleeves, not letting one another, and nimbly jumped into the field. An old Miao woman who had always used the old method of transplanting rice seedlings quickly accepted the new things, and learned the new transplanting technique in a short time.
    When we came back, it was already dusk. The daughter of the Qingyan cooperative director and the daughter-in-law of the Zhou family in Yingpanpo were still plowing the fields in Wayaojing, raising their heads, straightening their chests, and very skillfully operating two double-wheel double-share plows. A township head asked them why they hadn't finished work yet. One of the two women replied loudly: "The representatives have worked hard, please go back and eat! We have to finish plowing these fields during the day, and we will also repair the road at night." The distance was relatively far, and it was impossible to distinguish whose voice it was. I stood by the road, looking at them from afar, and suddenly remembered what the township secretary told me: "The women here all go to work early and finish work late, and are more heroic under the moonlight." The team of representatives had already walked a long way ahead, and I didn't even know it.

    青岩乡的一天
    蹇先艾
    公共汽车翻过了桐木岭，下了坡又上坡，有时在蒙蒙小雨似的尘土的飞扬中前进。一个半小时以后，我们就望见青岩桥了。拱洞两侧，写了八个令人警惕的大字：“跃进光荣，疲沓可耻。”桥边有一群农民正在忙于用马车拉河沙。一望无际的田坝上，散布着多少戽水和犁田的队伍啊！北村和东村的路旁、坡上耸立着一排排崭新的、高大的房屋，在我们眼前一闪就过去了。
    下了车，走进了一别两年的青岩乡，首先引起我注意的是街道打扫得十分干净，家家户户门上都贴着“清洁”的小纸条。有几家门口，还有老人和妇女在那里刷刷地扫地。沿街的机关、供销社、农业社、农具厂和收购站已经装上了电灯，从室外便看得见电灯的侧影。我还记得办初级社的时候，青岩的农民一般都点菜油灯、桐油灯，连点煤油灯的也很少；供销社运来了一批煤油灯，一直摆在柜顶上吃灰。怎么忽然会跃进得这样快呢？我向一位扫地的老农民打招呼道：
    “老同志，你们搞起电灯来了吗？真是了不起！”
    “这算得了什么！”那位头上盘着青布头巾的老人伸直了腰，一只手拄着长帚把，被太阳晒黑了的脸上闪烁着微笑，瞥了我一眼，鼻子一哼说。“这是一个小电厂，才供两百盏灯用电，哪里会够呢！我们还准备搞一个大一点的厂。如今有了共产党的领导，建设起来，就是比神仙的本事还要大。”
    到了区委会，好像办喜事一样，墙上到处都张贴着共青团支部、农业社、铁木社等等的红纸写的喜报、倡议书、挑战书之类。手工业工人和农民把大跃进中自己用心思制造出来的土机器，列了一张表，许多新奇的名字都是我没有听见过的：什么五行播种机呀，滚筒钉齿钯呀，悬弓式的抽水机呀，颗粒肥料手摇机呀，……有些东西的名目已经记不清楚了。
    两位区委书记都到乡里来了：书记是来给妇女干部会议作报告的；副书记大概是来检查生产的，正在和一位市委农村工作部下来的干部谈话。大乡的那位书记也正在主持着一个小会，和几个农民讨论怎样发展青岩的蔬菜业。不便去打扰他们，我就借着这个机会在院子里踱着步，挨着顺序细读那些使人眼花缭乱的大字报。
    直到午饭以后，大乡的党委书记才趁着休息的时间，简单地向我谈了一下青岩农业社最近的情况：新式农具已经普遍地使用起来；农民们个个都学会了三角丛植；队队都建立了自己的托儿所；除了每家平均养猪两头之外，社里还修了新式猪圈，来作集体养猪之用（已养了几十头小猪）；新建了鱼塘、鸡场；开展了好几种副业；学会了制造化学肥料和饲料；挖了一条很长的排洪沟；基本上完成了村与村、寨与寨之间的道路网。农民出身的布依族党委书记讲得眉飞色舞；我听得津津有味，不由自主也手舞足蹈起来。他最后还告诉我：“我们乡已经划归了贵阳市的郊区，大家以后要多考虑给城市服务的问题了。这样一划，农民们个个高兴，生产情绪空前高涨，觉得跃进就会更快一些。尽管上级只要每亩产量达到八百斤，我们还是要拿出干劲和钻劲来，争取每亩一千斤。技术革新的劲头也更大了。”
    后来，我到乡人委去，旁听区里召开的二十几个乡的妇女干部会议，有五十多个人出席这个会，大部分都是女乡长、女社主任，也有兼着党分支书的。有苗族、布依族，也有汉族。有年纪较大的、经验丰富的干部，也有年轻的正在成长的姑娘们。她们的装束虽然不同，却有一个共同的特点：清洁、朴素。类似这样的会，从土改起，我参加过很多次。过去在开会的时候，总有少数人不大注意听报告，喜欢自己在下面“开小会”，打瞌睡，搓麻线，抐鞋底；有些还背着很小的孩子来开会，弄得他们哭啼吵闹。这次的情形，确使我耳目为之一新：每位代表都是精神抖擞的，不但静悄悄地听报告，而且记笔记的也很不少，记得并不慢。由于有了可靠的托儿所，孩子们也都不带来了。
    我跟着她们去参观了青岩农业社的颗粒肥料厂、温床育苗、简易猪圈、新式秧田、鱼塘和托儿所。到了水田边，看见有些女社员正在那里插三角秧，她们都举手欢呼起来。“单靠耳朵听、眼睛看是不行的，应该自己动手去栽一下试试！”说着，几位青年妇女带头，年老的跟着，马上脱了鞋子，卷起裤筒，挽起袖子，一个不让一个，轻捷地就跳下田去了。一个一向用旧法插秧的苗族老大娘，对新事物接受得很快，一会儿就学会了新的插秧技术。
  我们回来的时候，已经是暮色苍茫了。青岩社主任的女儿和营盘坡周家的媳妇还在瓦窑井犁田，抬起头，挺着胸膛，很娴熟地操纵着两架双轮双铧犁。有一位乡长问她们为什么还不收工。两位妇女中的一位高声回答：“代表们辛苦了，请回去用饭吧！我们要趁白天把这几块田犁完，晚上还要去修马路。”距离比较远，也辨不清是谁的声音。我站在路旁，遥望着她们，忽然想起了乡里书记告诉我的话：“我们这里的妇女，个个都是早出工，晚收工，在月亮底下比英雄的。”代表们的队伍已经往前走了好远，我都不知道。
