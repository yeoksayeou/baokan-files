    Tap Water Like Yellow Mud Soup

    The tap water used by residents in the Dongzhou area of Fushun City is often very murky because it is not filtered or settled. During the winter freezing period, the water is relatively clear, but in the summer, the tap water becomes yellow mud soup, and sometimes even small fish flow into the users' water pipes. The tap water in this area is not only supplied for residents to drink, but also for hospitals to use. This murky tap water will affect people's health. It is hoped that the relevant departments in Fushun City will quickly find a way to solve this problem.

    自来水像黄泥汤
    抚顺市东洲地区居民用的自来水，因为没有过滤和沉淀，经常很混。在冬季结冰期间，水还比较清一些，一到夏天，自来水就成了黄泥汤，有时连小鱼都流到用户的水管子里来了。这个地区的自来水不单供给居民食用，还供给医院用。这种浑浊的自来水会影响人民的身体健康。希望抚顺市有关部门赶快设法解决。
