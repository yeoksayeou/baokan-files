Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom
Guo Moruo

33　Bleeding Heart
　　A comrade compared us to Hong Xiannv,
　　But we don't have Hong Xiannv's singing voice.
　　That is truly soul-stirring, capable of lingering for three days;
　　That is truly as clear as jade, capable of stopping the clouds.
　　In our pouches, we only brought letters,
　　The letters had no words, only hearts.
　　In the Great Leap Forward's spring, 600 million people are leaping forward,
　　Hearts entrusted to us to bring to Beijing.

34　Tulip
　　Persian poets once compared us to wine cups,
　　But they mistakenly only used us for self-intoxication. (Note 1)
　　Today we want to toast the Great Leap Forward,
　　And shout long live the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
　　The Yellow River's waters will no longer come from the sky,
　　High gorges will yield placid lakes, and the cries of apes will no longer wail in the sky. (Note 2)
　　The greatest transformation will be to see the Yellow Sea become the Qinghai Lake,
　　The whole people are invigorated, truly something great can be achieved.

　　(Note 1) Omar Khayyam, "Rubaiyat," Verse 40: "The Tulip from the desert's face doth rise, / And humbly then the dew of morning sip. / That you may know how little while that endures / Fill every cup with wine, before you fall asleep." (literal back-translation)
　　(Note 2) Li Bai's "Bring in the Wine" contains the line "The Yellow River's waters come from the sky," and "Ballad of Changgan" narrates the Three Gorges with the line "The cries of apes wail in the sky."
　　"High gorges yield placid lakes" is a line from Chairman Mao's "Water Melody," referring to the Yangtze River Three Gorges becoming a reservoir.

35　Hosta
　　Milk-white flower hairpins clustered on jade-green branches,
　　One flower withers, another blooms, day and night without rest.
　　Fan-shaped green leaves gently fan the fragrant breeze,
　　Maintaining purity, daring not to have arrogance or coyness.
　　We do not need any lavish enjoyment,
　　But ample sunshine is definitely necessary.
　　If you plant us in a dark place,
　　Then we will be stained with bureaucracy and senility, seedlings that do not flourish.

36　Cockscomb
　　Chairman's words, "Once the rooster crows, all under heaven is white," (Note)
　　Speak of revolutionary victory, the people gaining liberation.
　　But revolution is one connected to another.
　　We must maintain vigor, always keep the dawn.
　　Therefore, we especially stretch our necks,
　　Therefore, we especially open our throats:
　　"Go all out, aim high, and ride the wind and waves!"
　　Who hasn't heard? Too deaf to be believable!

　　(Note) A line from Chairman's "Tune of Washing Brook Sand".

37　Amaranth
　　Our genus is about the same as the Cockscomb,
　　People generally regard our leaves as flowers.
　　When the geese arrive, the leaves turn scarlet,
　　From top to bottom, the older we get, the redder we are.
　　Therefore, our name is also called "Old Youngster,"
　　With rich meaning, dialectics hidden inside.
　　Today, no one should be old,
　　But should be redder the older they get, and redder and younger.

38　Calla Lily
　　Although we are originally from Africa,
　　Africa and Asia are inherently connected.
　　We have already been transplanted to China.
　　And are now in the midst of ten thousand horses galloping.
　　We also want to respond to the Great Leap Forward,
　　Our snow-white horse hooves stamp and break the blue sky.
　　Calling on Asia and Africa to unite as one,
　　Quickly leave imperialism behind.

　　(Editor's Note) Comrade Guo Moruo began writing "Letting a Hundred Flowers Bloom" on March 30th. He had previously written six poems. After spending another ten days writing over ninety more poems, he completed the entire "Hundred Flowers" in early April. Since the newspaper began publishing them on April 3rd, we have continuously received letters from readers, some even sending paintings, flower seeds, specimens, etc., which we have all forwarded to the author for reference. Due to the large number of letters, we are unable to reply to each one individually.

### 百花齐放
郭沫若

专栏：

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    33　荷包牡丹
    有一位同志把我们比成红线女，
    但我们却没有红线女那片歌声。
    那真是荡气回肠，可以绕梁三日；
    那真是清沏于玉，可以响遏行云。
    在荷包中只带来了一封一封的信，
    信上都没有字，而是一颗一颗的心。
    在大跃进的春天六亿人民在跃进，
    一颗一颗的心托我们带到了北京。
    34　郁金香
    波斯诗人曾经把我们比成酒杯，
    但他错误地只用来作自我陶醉。（注一）
    我们今天是要为大跃进而干杯，
    高呼中国共产党和毛主席万岁！
    黄河之水今后不会再从天上来，
    高峡出平湖，猿声不再在天上哀。（注二）
    最大的变异要看到黄海变成青海，
    全民振奋，真真正正地大有可为。
    （注一）莪默·伽亚牟“鲁拜集”第40首：“郁金香从沙中仰望，承受着夜露以备晨觞。你也请举起杯来痛醉，醉到玉山倒地如像空杯。”
    （注二）李白“将进酒”中有“黄河之水天上来”句，又“长干行”中叙到三峡处有“猿声天上哀”句。
    “高峡出平湖”是主席“水调歌头”中的一句，言长江三峡成为水库。
    35　玉簪花
    乳白的花簪聚插在碧玉梢头，
    一花谢了，一花又开，昼夜不休。
    扇形的绿叶把香风扇得和柔，
    保持清白，骄气、娇气都不敢有。
    我们不需要任何阔气的享受，
    但温暖的阳光定要十分足够。
    如果把我们栽种在阴暗地方，
    那就染上官气、暮气，苗而不秀。
    36　鸡冠花
    主席的词句“一唱雄鸡天下白”，（注）
    是说革命胜利，人民得到解放。
    但革命是要一个连接着一个。
    必须保持朝气，时时都是天亮。
    因此，我们特别地伸长了颈项，
    因此，我们特别地敞开了喉嗓：
    “鼓足干劲，力争上游，乘风破浪！”
    谁还没听见吗？聋得太不像样！
    （注）主席“浣溪沙”中的一句。
    37　雁来红
    我们和鸡冠花种属是差不多，
    一般把我们的叶子就当成花。
    雁鹅来时，叶子转为一片猩红，
    由上而下地愈老愈是红东东。
    因此，我们的名字又叫老少年，
    含义丰富，有辩证法藏在里面。
    在今天无论是谁都不应该老，
    应该是愈老愈红而愈红愈少。
    38　马蹄莲
    我们虽然是非洲的原产，
    非洲和亚洲本一脉相连。
    我们已经移植到了中国。
    更处在万马奔腾的目前。
     我们也要响应着大跃进，
    雪白的马蹄倒踏破青天。
    号召亚洲非洲团结一致，
    快把帝国主义丢在后面。
    （编者附记）郭沫若同志写“百花齐放”是从3月30日开始的，以前曾作了六首。又费了十天工夫写了九十几首，四月上旬即将“百花”全部写完了。本报自4月3日开始登载以来，不断接到读者来信，有的还寄来绘画、花种、标本等，我们都曾转给作者参考了。因来信很多，不及一一答复。
