　　Promoting New Tools for Planting Trees and Creating Forests
　　——An Introduction to the Forestry Machinery Hall at the Agricultural Tools Exhibition
    Our reporter Gu Ye Shi
    This year, over 290 million mu of afforestation has been completed across the country. In addition, more than 13 billion trees have been planted beside villages, houses, rivers, and roads. In order to achieve the task of greening the motherland as soon as possible, it is estimated that more than 900 million mu of afforestation will be required nationwide in the next three years. With such large-scale afforestation, various regions require more efficient tools for planting trees and creating forests. The Forestry Machinery Hall exhibits a wide variety of afforestation machinery, including those for seed collection, sowing, transplanting, and fertilization, most of which have been created by forestry workers in various regions in recent years. This hall introduces a batch of lightweight seed collection and sowing tools: Here we can see various high-branch shears, scissor-type toothed seed strippers suitable for picking thorny seeds, as well as picking knives, five-knife seed collection sickles, four-tooth combs, etc. Using these tools to collect seeds can improve efficiency.
    Tree seeds vary in size, some as small as millet grains and others larger than walnuts, and their shapes also vary, so the sowing tools required for raising seedlings are very complex. Among the dozen or so sowing tools exhibited here are the large ridge seeder from Beizhen County Nursery in Liaoning Province, the six-row strip seeder from Tongchuan State-owned Forest Farm in Shaanxi Province, the horse-drawn six-row seeder from Wanshou Palace Forest Farm in Pingyi County, Shandong Province, the poplar seeder designed by the Second Nursery in Baicheng County, Jilin Province, and the poplar and mulberry sowing roller from Faku County Nursery in Liaoning Province. These machines are not only made from locally sourced materials, efficient, and easy to use, but most of them have also been specially designed according to the size and shape of the seeds.
    We had never heard of using a seeder to sow winged seeds before, but this time the Tongliao Agricultural Tool Factory in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sent a winged seed seeder for exhibition. Operated by two people and pulled by one horse, it can sow 15 mu per day, increasing efficiency nine times compared to large ridge sowing. It should be said that this is a major reform in forestry tools.
    The area of ​​desert in northwest and northeast China is quite large. To change the soil there, we must first plant a large amount of sand sagebrush. However, sandy areas are often windy, and sand sagebrush seeds are very small, which makes sowing difficult. The sand sagebrush seeder manufactured by the Suburban Forest Farm in Chifeng County, Zhaowuda League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, exhibited this time is designed for this situation. One person can sow more than 37 mu a day, which is five times more efficient than the old-fashioned rake sowing method, and the survival rate reaches 95%.
    This hall also exhibits some tools for transplanting seedlings. The small seedling transplanter created by Peng Bingzuo, a worker at Huai'an County Nursery in Hebei Province, can move 1,000 to 2,000 seedlings per day, which is very efficient. This transplanter is composed of two sets of large and small sleeves. First, dig a pit in the area where transplanting is needed, then use the transplanter to press down on the seedling, so that the seedling and the soil can be lifted together in the transplanting tube and placed in the dug pit. In addition, combining the two sets of shovel and tiller machines used in agriculture, removing the plowshare and replacing it with a seedling-raising knife, can not only raise a large number of seedlings, but also be used to shovel the ground, making full use of the tools. It is also a good way to improve forestry tools.
    Forestry workers also have many creations in felling and timber harvesting. Here, forestry workers have folded the two-person fast-horse saw in half and changed it to a one-person operation curved-handle saw, which can not only solve the problem of insufficient logging technicians, but also improve efficiency by 36% compared to using the fast-horse saw. This is the creation of forestry workers.
    It is also worth noting that forestry machinery workers have successfully imitated the Soviet Friendship chainsaw in the Great Leap Forward. This saw uses gasoline as power and is more convenient than an electric saw, and is also very efficient.
    Collecting and transporting timber is quite arduous labor. The handicraft-style timber harvesting methods are nothing more than manual carrying, slope dragging, flatbed timber harvesting, cattle and horse harness timber harvesting, and the use of various water chutes, wood chutes, bamboo chutes, etc. for timber harvesting. The forestry department is actively promoting the method of overhead transportation to protect the soil, facilitate site renewal, and reduce manual labor. The bamboo strip aerial cableway created by the Hongjiang Branch of the Hunan Provincial Forestry Industry Bureau has been successfully tested in forest areas such as Jingxian and Huitong counties. This is a major achievement in technological innovation in the southern forest industry. The bamboo cable replaces the steel cable, and the cost per kilometer is only one-sixth of that of the steel cable. Moreover, it does not require power and is easy to erect, operate, and repair. This method of transporting wood is already being promoted in the Xiangxi mountainous area. The logging workers in the Zashuling forest area of ​​Sanyang Township, She County, Anhui Province, use waste materials and branches to adjust the slope with high and low supports on complex terrain, and erect bridge-type timber slide ways. This method of transporting wood is much more efficient than manual carrying and ensures personal safety. In the past, one person could only carry one piece of wood from the mountain to the bottom of the mountain in a day. After using the bridge-type slide way, they can transport 500 pieces a day, with a maximum of 740 pieces. In the exhibition hall, visitors can see models of these two transportation methods.
    Among the exhibits, there are also many forestry machinery, which have great power in afforestation work.
    The various tools exhibited for hunting and capturing forest wild animals have attracted the attention of all visitors. These tools reflect the infinite wisdom of people in the struggle against various wild animals, whether ferocious or clever.

　　推广植树造林新工具
　　——农具展览会林业机具馆介绍
    本报记者　顾也是
    今年，全国各地已经造林二亿九千多万亩。另外，还在村旁、宅旁、河旁、道旁栽了一百三十多亿株树。为了提早实现绿化祖国的任务，预计今后三年内全国还须造林九亿多亩。这样大规模的造林，各地要求有效率更高的植树造林的工具。林业机具馆展出的植树造林器械种类很多，有采种的、播种的、移植的、施肥的等等，多数是近年来各地林业工人所创造。这个馆介绍了一批轻便的采种和播种工具：我们在这里可以看到有各种高枝剪，有适于摘取多刺种子的剪式齿形捋种器，还有采摘刀、五刀采种镰、四齿梳等。用这些工具采集树种都能提高效率。
    树木的种子，有很小的，小到比小米粒还小，也有比核桃还大的，形状也不一，因而育苗需用的播种工具就很复杂。在这里展出的十几种播种工具中，有辽宁省北镇县苗圃的大垅播种机、陕西省铜川国营林场的六行带状播种机、山东省平邑县万寿宫林场的马拉六行播种机，吉林省白城县第二苗圃设计的杨树播种器，辽宁省法库县苗圃的杨桑播种磙等，这些机具不仅是就地取材制造，效率高，使用方便，而且大都根据种子的大小形状不同而作了不同的处理。
    以前还没有听说过用播种机来播种翅果的，这次内蒙古自治区通辽农具厂送来展出了一架翅果播种机，由两个人操纵、一匹马牵引，每天可播种十五亩，比大垅播种要提高效率九倍。应该说，这是林业工具中的一大改革。
    我国西北部和东北部砂荒面积相当大，要改变那里的土壤首先就得种植大量的砂蒿。但砂荒地区经常刮大风，砂蒿种子又很小，这给播种造成了很大困难。这次展出内蒙古自治区昭乌达盟赤峰县城郊林场制造的砂蒿播种器就是针对这种情况而设计的。一个人一天能播种三十七亩多，比旧式耙子播种效率提高五倍，成活率达到95％。
    这个馆还展出了一些移植树苗的工具。河北省怀安县苗圃工人彭秉佐创造的小苗移植器，一人一天可移动幼苗一千到二千株，效率很高。这种移植器是由大小两个套筒架组成的。在需要移植的地方先开好一个坑，然后用移植器对准幼苗下压，这样就可连苗带土起在移植筒内，放到开好的坑中。此外还有把农业上用的两部铲趟机合在一起，去掉犁铧换成起苗刀，既可以大量起苗，又可用以铲地，充分利用了工具，也是改良林业工具的好办法。
    在采伐和集材等方面林业工人也有许多创造。这里有林业工人把两人使用的快马锯一折为二，改为一人操作的弯把锯，既可以解决伐木技术工人不足的问题，又比使用快马锯提高了效率36％。这是林业工人的创造。
    林业机具工人在大跃进中仿制成功苏联友谊油锯，也是值得重视的。这种锯使用汽油发动，比电锯更为方便，效率也很高。
    集运木材是相当艰苦的劳动。手工业式的集材办法不外乎用人工肩运、串坡、平车集材、牛马套子集材，以及利用各种水滑道、木滑道、竹滑道等集材。林业部门正积极提倡架空运输的办法，以保护土壤，和便于迹地更新，减轻人力劳动。湖南省森林工业局洪江分局创造集材的竹条架空索道，已经在靖县、会同等林区试验成功，这是南方森林工业技术革新中的重大成就。以竹索代替了钢索，每公里的成本仅及钢索的六分之一，而且不用动力，易于架设、操作和修理。湘西山区已经在推广这种运材办法。安徽省歙县三羊乡杂树岭林区的采伐工人利用废材和枝桠在复杂的地形上以高矮支架调剂坡度，架设桥型集材木滑道，这种运材的方式比用人工肩运提高效率很多，而且保证了人身安全。以前一个人由山上扛木材往山下运一天只能运一根木材，利用桥型滑道后，一天可运五百根，最高达到七百四十根。在展览馆里，观众们都可以看到这两种运材方式的模型。
    在展出的实物中，还有不少林业上用的机械，它们在造林工作中都有很大的威力。
    展出的狩捕森林野兽的各种工具，在这里受到所有参观者的注意，这些工具体现了人们在同无论凶猛的或机伶的各种野兽的斗争中具有无限的智慧。
