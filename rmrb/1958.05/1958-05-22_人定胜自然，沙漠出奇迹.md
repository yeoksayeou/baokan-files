Man Can Conquer Nature, Miracles Can Emerge from the Desert
Liu Xianzhu, Secretary of the CCP Yulin County Committee, Shaanxi Province

At present, the county has afforested more than 800,000 mu, with a green coverage of 12% of the county's total area.

Yulin County is a desert hilly area in northern Shaanxi, bordering the Great Wall. Deserts account for more than 60% of the county's total area, and arable land is only 9%. It is windy and sandy all year round. Whenever there is a strong wind, the yellow sand obscures the sky and sun, setting off raging waves that roll southward, constantly submerging farmland and pastures, and threatening villages and towns. As the local people say, "The wind blows yellow sand, making it difficult to open your eyes; crop seedlings can't emerge completely; houses are buried by sand, and people have to move away; the wicked yellow sand causes great suffering." According to local chronicles, Yulin County was forced to move three times, and the desert moved southward more than 140 li in 150 years. At the same time, there is little rainfall, with an annual rainfall of only 300 millimeters, mostly concentrated in autumn. The climate is extremely harsh, with a large daily temperature range, often described as "wear fur in the morning, gauze at noon, and eat watermelon around the stove." "Spring is dry and windy with lots of sand, autumn is rainy and prone to early frost, and hail is inevitable every year." Natural disasters frequently threaten the growth of crops. Therefore, yields are very low and unstable, with an average yield of only about 30 jin per mu before liberation. Since liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the people of the county have consistently regarded sand prevention and afforestation, turning the desert into fertile fields, as a primary task. Especially since the nationwide rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward, great progress has been made. This year, the county's task of afforesting 180,000 mu was overfulfilled by 130% in fifteen days. At present, the county has afforested more than 800,000 mu (including natural forests) and planted grass on more than 400,000 mu, building layers of green Great Walls in an area spanning more than 100 li. The green coverage has reached 12% of the county's total area, exceeding the area of arable land. As a result, the desolate appearance of the desert has changed significantly. Many sand dunes are basically fixed, and the annual rate of southward movement of shifting sand has been reduced from 7 or 8 meters in the early days of liberation to 2 or 3 meters. Thus, farmland is protected, and grain yields have increased year by year. In 1954, wind and sand killed more than 14,000 mu of crops, while the loss in 1957 was less than 1,000 mu. Although last year encountered serious disasters, the yield per mu still increased to 69 jin, more than 50% higher than the average yield before the cooperativization. At the same time, high-yield records such as 1,000 jin per mu in Huayuangou appeared. With the development of agriculture and forestry, animal husbandry has also greatly increased. In 1957, the number of sheep and large livestock in the county more than doubled compared to 1950.

The 1,000-jin-per-mu Huayuangou is a banner that inspires the people of the county to overcome the desert. Wind and sand resistance and soil improvement are the keys to ensuring increased production.

The 1,000-jin-per-mu Huayuangou is a banner that inspires the people of the county to overcome the desert and strive for high yields. Huayuangou, southeast of Yulin City, is a small gully surrounded by yellow sand hills. Here, as in all desert areas of the county, the climate is very harsh. There are nine small villages in the gully, inhabited by more than 200 households, who have long relied on some land wrested from the desert by their ancestors, living a poor life. Before liberation, the yield per mu of irrigated land was at most only 300 jin. After the winter of 1955, after cooperativization, the masses in Huayuangou actively responded to Chairman Mao's call, quickly launched a production upsurge, and in accordance with the county party committee's proposal to create a "1,000-jin commune" and a "1,000-jin township," launched an arduous struggle to strive for a yield of 1,000 jin per mu of irrigated land. In 1956, the Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative became a "1,000-jin-per-mu irrigated land cooperative," and last year the entire gully became a "1,000-jin-per-mu irrigated land gully." The average yield per mu of the more than 400 mu of irrigated land in the gully exceeded the average yield per mu of cultivated land in the county by more than 14 times, and the average yield per mu of irrigated land in the county by more than 4 times.

When the 1,000-jin-per-mu plan was first proposed, it was ridiculed by wealthy middle peasants, who said, "A toad wants to eat swan meat," "Public officials have nothing to do, they're just bragging!"; they also said that in the past, they had "good livestock, a lot of fertilizer, and used black soybean residue, and exhausted all their efforts, but still couldn't get 1,000 jin, so why would the agricultural cooperative be able to get so much!" Most poor and lower-middle peasants also thought that "there is a lot of wind and sand, many disasters, and little fertilizer, so it can't be done." Therefore, the branch launched a big debate on whether or not it could reach 1,000 jin per mu. In the debate, some poor peasant activists remembered a past event: more than 20 years ago, Chen Ruiyuan, an old farmer who was number one in farming in the whole gully, had two mu of irrigated land that had yielded more than 1,000 jin of rice. This event first inspired the activists, who firmly believed that "there are no blind fields, only blind people, as long as you prevent sand, do meticulous work, and apply more fertilizer, you can get 1,000 jin." This event also gave the comrades of the Party branch a great inspiration, making them think of going to the masses to find experience and seek teaching materials. The comrades of the branch visited the old farmer, and in response to the large amount of wind and sand and the salinization of irrigated land at that time, summarized the years of experience in increasing production by preventing wind and sand and improving the soil among the masses. They also used these experiences and facts to conduct extensive education among the masses, breaking various concerns, enhancing confidence, and determining the plan. At the same time, a political and ideological work "three-contract" system was established, with branch committee members contracting teams, Party members contracting groups, and Communist Youth League members contracting households, with everyone responsible, strengthening political and ideological work.

Wind and sand resistance and soil improvement are the keys to ensuring increased production locally. The Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative launched a series of works in this regard. More than 1,560 zhang of windbreaks were built on the edges of the sandy land with firewood and grass, and more than 500 mu of trees and grass were planted on the sandy slopes to prevent wind and sand erosion. All the lower wet sandy land was padded with a layer of soil, and all the alkaline land was covered with a layer of sand, improving the sandy and alkaline land and expanding the fertile fields. In terms of irrigation methods, in addition to changing from large-ditch flooding to small-ditch irrigation, the experience of "three looks," "two no irrigations," and "two waterings" was also promoted. The three looks are to look at the weather, the soil, and the crops when deciding the time and amount of watering; the two no irrigations are not to irrigate when there is a strong wind and not to irrigate when it is hot at noon; the two waterings are to water 80% of the water when the crops are seedlings and to water a follow-up watering when the crops are jointing and flowering. In terms of the cropping system, reasonable close planting was promoted, the area of high-yield crops such as rice and potatoes was expanded, and double cropping was increased. Expanding rice cultivation is also a way to change sandy soil. In places with irrigated land, planting rice in sandy wasteland, applying organic fertilizers such as twig and charcoal, can gradually turn sandy land into fertile fields. In addition, the old habit of "planting the land but not the edges, three mu becomes two and a half" was changed, and the method of "no grass on the ridges, no idle ridges, all ridges and edges are planted" was implemented, improving the utilization rate of the land.

Victory was only achieved after a resolute struggle against conservative ideas.

On the road forward, difficulties constantly arose. How to overcome difficulties? "The village looks at the village, the household looks at the household, and the masses look at the Party branch." The Party branch closely united the masses and overcame various difficulties in production one after another. When there was insufficient fertilizer, under the slogan of "fertilizer is grain," a movement of thousands of carts and tens of thousands of dan of fertilizer accumulation was launched. Men, women, old and young were mobilized to search for and collect fertilizer, implementing "nine soils returned to the fields": burnt soil, swept field soil, rotten kiln soil, temple dust soil, courtyard dirty soil, latrine stinky soil, road dust soil, millstone strong soil, ash residue soil, accumulating all the strong soil. They also composted green manure, dug sand charcoal, picked up sheep manure, and picked up wild manure in large quantities, solving the fertilizer difficulty. The victory in solving the fertilizer difficulty was also achieved after a resolute struggle against conservative ideas. When the commune members happily sang their own songs, "Male and female commune members compete to be models, get up early at five o'clock to carry sand charcoal, not afraid of the difficulty of long sandy roads, must strive for a thousand-jin fields" while carrying sand charcoal, some wealthy middle peasants said again: "Since ancient times, sand charcoal can only be used for burning, not for applying to the land (i.e. fertilizing). Carrying sand charcoal on a 20-li road is a waste of horses (i.e. a waste of livestock), and people who carry sand charcoal will also live ten years less." Because of this statement, the commune members' enthusiasm for carrying sand charcoal was not high, so only more than 60,000 jin were carried back that year. The township branch then introduced the Xiejiagou Agricultural Cooperative's method of composting sand charcoal, stable manure, and bone meal, and led Party members, Communist Youth League members, and activists to conduct experiments on 12 mu of potato land. As a result, the yield was 5,000 jin per mu, and compared with the same land and the same amount of fertilizer without sand charcoal, the yield was more than 500 jin per mu. Through the experiment, the masses were educated with facts, they believed that applying more sand charcoal would definitely increase production, and the wealthy middle peasants had nothing to say in the face of living facts. When there was insufficient draught animals, and the livestock were small and unable to pull the new-style walking plow, Party members and Communist Youth League members took the lead in pulling the plow, ensuring the timely and deep plowing of the land. In the process of production, serious natural disasters frequently attacked the crops, bringing great difficulties to the people striving for 1,000 jin. A hailstorm in the summer knocked all the crops down, and the masses were in low spirits and complained. Some people said, "Setting 1,000 jin has offended the heavens, and a hailstorm will ruin everything," and the old men blamed "using the clock of the Dragon King Temple (as a production order), offending the Dragon King," and secretly sent the clock back to the Dragon King Temple. The Party branch then quickly led the masses to carry out rescue work such as supporting seedlings, replanting seedlings, topdressing, and weeding, so that the crops quickly recovered their vitality. In the autumn, the Huayuangou Commune achieved an average yield of 1,018 jin per mu on more than 290 mu of irrigated land, and 7 mu of replanted millet yielded 1,240 jin per mu, thus becoming a "1,000-jin-per-mu irrigated land commune." However, because this year only focused on increasing fertilizer application and using too much commercial fertilizer, the cost was too high, and each work day could only be divided into 6 jiao and 2 fen. The commune members said that they were "planting gold and harvesting silver, which is not cost-effective." In 1957, the branch mobilized the commune members to actively plant green manure and carry sand charcoal in large quantities. As a result, not only was the fertilizer investment reduced by 5,800 yuan, but the amount of fertilizer applied per mu was also increased by 1,500 jin to 3,000 jin. Although this year, relentless disasters fell one after another on the members of the Huayuangou Commune, because they constantly fought stubbornly against the disasters, they still maintained the record of continuous 1,000 jin on more than 200 mu of old irrigated land in the whole commune, leaping from the original grain-deficient commune to a surplus-grain commune.

Although the Huayuangou Agricultural Cooperative achieved the plan of 1,000 jin per mu of irrigated land, in the whole county, the other agricultural cooperatives that originally planned to produce 1,000 jin per mu did not achieve it. So it became the talk of some people at the time, thinking that it was "rash advance," and even caused controversy in the Yulin Daily. With the support of the higher-level Party committee, the county Party committee refuted this incorrect argument, resolutely supported the initiative of the masses, and continued to let the township Party committee try to run a "1,000-jin mu" in the Weijialou Agricultural Cooperative, which is connected to Huayuangou. At first, the Weijialou Commune didn't believe in the 1,000-jin-per-mu irrigated land of Huayuangou, saying, "We have exhausted our efforts to produce 880 jin per mu, how can they produce 1,000 jin?" Some commune cadres even thought: "Huayuangou is either overestimating the area or falsely reporting!" But when they secretly measured several irrigated lands in Huayuangou and knew the truth, they were shocked. Later, under the guidance of the township Party committee, the Weijialou Commune checked their work and found that they were not keeping up with the Huayuangou Commune in five aspects: the leadership of the commune branch was not keeping up, the management was not keeping up, the fertilizer was not keeping up, the irrigation was not keeping up, and the acceptance of science and technology was not keeping up. Then, a upsurge of learning from and catching up with the Huayuangou Commune was launched. They not only accepted the advanced experience of the Huayuangou Commune, but also had new developments, and finally reached an average yield of 1,012 jin per mu of irrigated land in 1957. From then on, the entire Huayuangou gully became a "1,000-jin gully."

Things are done by people. As long as we dare to break the circle of following the old ways, are not willing to be slaves of nature, and give full play to our subjective initiative and bold creativity, it is possible to overcome nature.

The emergence of the 1,000-jin gully shows that the production potential of sandy land surrounded by deserts is very great, and it is entirely possible to change low yield to high yield. It is the most vivid and powerful criticism of all "regionalism" and "conditionalism." It has once again made us realize that things are done by people. As long as we dare to break the circle of following the old ways, are not willing to be slaves of nature, and give full play to our subjective initiative and bold creativity, it is possible to overcome nature. Now, in the areas with irrigated land in the whole county, a upsurge of learning from and catching up with the 1,000-jin gully has been launched. This year, in addition to raising the yield of the 1,000-jin gully to 1,500 jin per mu, it is also planned to newly cultivate one 1,000-jin town, one 1,000-jin township, one 1,000-jin gully, and 14 1,000-jin communes, so that the irrigated land with a yield of 1,000 jin per mu reaches 15,000 mu.

The emergence of the 1,000-jin gully points out a bright future for the people who are fighting against the desert. It shows that after the desert is transformed into fertile land, it can produce 1,000 jin. It has greatly encouraged the enthusiasm of the people of the county to fight against the desert. The people of the county are using the rich experience accumulated over the years to launch an unprecedented struggle against wind and sand. According to our experience, to overcome the desert, we must rely on the masses, use natural forces, and take the method of "one thing subduing another," promoting planting treatment, wind treatment, and water treatment. Planting treatment means planting trees and grass, greening the desert, and fixing the sand dunes. Wind treatment means combining the use of wind power with planting trees and grass, using grass and trees to control the movement of sand dunes and using wind power to level sand dunes. Planting grass and trees on the receding sand slope of the windward slope on the north side of the sand dunes to create a barrier so that the receding sand is maintained at a certain level. On the south side of the sand dunes, planting grass and trees one or two zhang away from the foot of the sand to block the shifting sand. When the wind blows the sand, the shifting sand above the receding sand slope gradually fills the open space on the south side of the sand dunes. The masses call this method "blocking in the front and pulling in the back, leveling the sand dunes." Water treatment has two methods: one is to divert water to pull the sand, first use artificial channels to divert water to the foot of the sand dunes, use water to flush the sand, pull the sand downstream, and gradually level the sand dunes. This method is nearly 1,000 times more efficient than artificially leveling the sand dunes. The 30-li-long Heihaizi channel was used to level dozens of large and small sand dunes, turning more than 5,000 mu of sandy wasteland into irrigated land; the other method is to dig channels to drain water to treat salinization, draining upward and irrigating and flooding the sandy beaches downward. Now we are using the method of diverting water to pull the sand, diverting water to the sand beams. There are two channels that have already started construction. One is from Honghualiang to Zhenchuanpu, which is more than 280 li long, and the other is from Paiziwan to the upper reaches of the Wuding River, which is more than 110 li long, with a sand control area of at least 400,000 mu and irrigating beaches and mountains of more than 300,000 mu. These two projects can be basically completed this year. We firmly believe that under the illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the 1,000-jin gully in the desert will surely bloom everywhere in Yulin.

    人定胜自然，沙漠出奇迹
    中共陕西省榆林县委书记　　刘咸珠
    目前全县植树造林已达八十多万亩，绿化面积达全县总面积12％。
    榆林县是陕北靠长城的一个沙漠丘陵地区，沙漠占了全县总面积的60％以上，可耕地只有9％。常年多风沙，每遇大风，黄沙遮天蔽日，掀起狂涛怒浪，向南滚滚移动，农田、牧地不断被淹没，村庄、城镇也经常受威胁。恰如当地群众所说的“风刮黄沙难睁眼，庄稼苗苗出不全，房屋沙压人移走，万恶的黄沙害人苦”。据地方志记载，榆林县城曾被迫三次迁移，一百五十年来沙漠南移一百四十多里。同时，那里雨水稀少，年降雨量只有三百多公厘，且多集中在秋季。气候异常恶劣，温度日差很大，往往是“早穿皮袄午穿纱，围着火炉吃西瓜”。“春季干旱风沙大，秋季雨涝落霜早，雹灾年年少不了”。自然灾害经常威胁着农作物的生长。因而，产量很低，又不稳定，解放前平均亩产只三十斤左右。解放后，全县人民在党的领导下，一直把防沙造林、变沙漠为良田，当作一项首要的任务。特别是在全民整风和生产大跃进以来，工作有了很大的进展，今年全县造林十八万亩的任务，在十五天的时间内就以130％超额完成了。目前全县植树造林已达八十多万亩（包括天然林），种草四十多万亩，在纵横一百多里的地区内已筑起了层层的绿色长城。绿化面积已达全县总面积12％，超过了耕地面积。从而使沙漠的荒凉面貌有了显著改变，不少沙丘基本固定，流沙每年向南移动的速度，由解放初的七、八公尺已降低到两三公尺了，因而保护了农田，粮食产量逐年上升。1954年风沙打死了庄稼一万四千多亩，而1957年的损失已不到一千亩；去年虽遇到严重的灾情，但亩产仍增到六十九斤，比合作化以前常年产量高出50％以上，同时还出现了像花园沟亩产千斤的大面积丰产纪录。随着农业、林业的发展，畜牧业也大大增长了，1957年全县羊子和大家畜比1950年都增加了一倍多。
    亩产千斤的花园沟，是鼓舞全县人民战胜沙漠的旗帜。防风抗沙和改良土壤是保证增产的关键。
    亩产千斤的花园沟，是鼓舞全县人民战胜沙漠争取高额丰产的旗帜。花园沟在榆林城的东南，是被四面黄沙丘陵包围的一条小沟。这里，同全县所有沙漠地区一样，气候十分恶劣。沟里有九个小村庄，住着二百多户人家，他们长期依靠祖先从沙漠中争夺出来的一些土地，过着贫苦的生活。解放前水地亩产最多只不过三百斤。1955年冬合作化以后，花园沟的群众积极响应了毛主席的号召，迅速掀起了生产高潮，并根据县委提出创造千斤社、千斤乡的要求，开展了为争取水地亩产千斤的艰苦斗争，1956年花园沟农业社就变成了水地亩产千斤社，到去年全沟变成了水地亩产千斤沟。沟内四百多亩水地的平均亩产比全县耕地平均亩产超过十四倍，比全县水地平均亩产超过四倍多。
    亩产千斤计划开始提出时，曾遭到富裕中农的讥笑，说什么“癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉”，“公家人没事干，胡吹哩！”；又说，他们过去“牲口好，肥料多，上黑豆油渣，把力出尽了，还打不到千斤，农业社凭什么能打到那么多！”大多数贫苦农民也认为“风沙大，灾害多，肥料少，办不到”。于是，支部发动了一个能不能达到亩产千斤的大辩论。在辩论中，有些贫农积极分子想起了过去一件事：二十多年前，在全沟做庄稼数第一的老农陈瑞源，有两亩水地曾打过上千斤的稻子。这件事首先鼓舞了积极分子，他们坚信“有瞎人，没瞎地，只要防住沙，细作务，多施肥，就能打千斤”。这件事也给了党支部的同志们一个很大启发，使他们想起了应该到群众中去找经验，寻教材。支部的同志便访问了老农，针对当时风沙大和水地盐碱化的情况，总结了多年来群众中防风沙和改良土壤的增产经验。又用这些经验和事实，在群众中进行了广泛的教育，打破了种种顾虑，增强了信心，确定了计划。同时，建立了政治思想工作“三包干”的制度，支委包队，党员包组，团员包户，人人有责，加强了政治思想工作。
    防风抗沙和改良土壤是当地保证增产的关键，花园沟农业社在这方面展开了一系列的工作。在走风沙的地畔上用柴草搭起了一千五百六十多丈的防风帐，沙坡上植树种草五百多亩，防止了风沙的侵袭。所有的下湿沙地都垫了一层土，碱地都压了一层沙，改良了沙、碱地，扩大了良田。在灌溉方法上，除了改大畦漫灌为小畦灌溉外，并推广了“三看”、“两不灌”、“两浇水”的经验。三看，就是浇水的时间和多少，要看天气、看土壤、看庄稼；两不灌，就是刮大风不灌、中午炎热时不灌；两浇水，就是庄稼幼苗时浇八成水，拔节扬花时浇回头水。在耕作制度上，推广了合理密植，扩大了水稻、洋芋等高产作物面积，增加了复种。扩大水稻也是改变沙质土壤的一种方法，在有水地的地方，沙荒地种稻，加施柠条、沙炭等有机肥料，就可逐年变沙地为良田。此外，还改变了“种地不种畔，三亩变成二亩半”的旧习惯，推行了“楞无草、埂不闲，埂埂畔畔都种完”的办法，提高了土地利用率。
    胜利是同保守思想作了坚决斗争后才获得的。
    在前进的道路上，困难不断出现。如何战胜困难？“村看村，户看户，群众看的党支部”，党支部紧紧地团结了群众，一个接一个地战胜了生产中的各种困难。肥料不足，就在“肥料就是粮食”的口号下，掀起了千车万担的积肥运动。男女老少齐动员，搜肥集肥，实行“九土归田”，烧焦土、扫场土、烂窑土、庙尘土、院落脏土、茅坑臭土、道路尘土、磨道壮土、灰渣土，把壮土统统积起来，又大量沤青肥、挖沙炭、拣羊粪、拾野粪，解决了肥料困难。在解决肥料困难时，也是同保守思想作了坚决斗争后才获得胜利的。当社员们兴高采烈地唱着自己编的歌“男女社员争模范，五更起早背沙炭，沙大路远不怕难，一定要争千斤田”背沙炭时，又有些富裕中农说：“自古以来沙炭只能烧火不能上地。（即施肥），二十里路上驮沙炭是白压马王爷哩（即白压牲畜），人背沙炭也要少活十年”。这一说社员们背沙炭情绪不高了，因而这年只背回六万多斤。乡支部随即介绍了谢家坬农业社沙炭、厩肥、骨粉混合沤肥办法，并领导党团员积极分子在十二亩洋芋地上进行了试验，结果亩产五千斤，和未上沙炭的同等地、同等施肥量对比，每亩多产五百余斤。通过试验，用事实教育了群众，相信了多施沙炭一定能增产，富裕中农们在活生生的事实面前也无话可说了。耕畜不足，牲口小，拉不动新式步犁，党团员就带头拉犁，保证了耕地的及时深翻。在生产过程中，严重的自然灾害经常袭击着农作物，给争取千斤的人们带来了很大的困难。夏季的一场雹灾，把庄稼打得都躺倒了，群众情绪低落，怨言四起，有人说“定千斤欺了天，一场雹雨就完蛋”，老头子们怪“用了龙王庙的钟（当生产号令），惹下了龙王爷”，把钟偷偷地送回龙王庙。党支部又迅速领导群众开展了扶苗、补苗、追肥、锄地等抢救工作，使庄稼很快恢复了元气。秋后花园沟社在二百九十多亩水地上平均亩产达到了一千零一十八斤，有七亩青稞复种糜子亩产达一千二百四十斤，从而变成了水地亩产千斤社。但是，因为这一年只顾增施肥料，使用商品肥料过多，结果摊本太大，每个劳动日仅能分六角二分钱。社员说是“种金子，收银子，不合算”。1957年支部便发动社员积极种青肥，大量背沙炭，结果不但使肥料投资减少了五千八百元，而且每亩施肥量又增加了一千五百斤到三千斤。虽然这一年无情的灾害又接二连三地落到了花园沟社员的头上，但是，由于他们不断地和灾害作了顽强的斗争，仍然在全社二百多亩老水地上保持了连获千斤的纪录，由原来的缺粮社，一跃而为余粮社。
    尽管花园沟农业社实现了水地亩产千斤的计划，但是在全县范围内，原来计划亩产千斤的其他几个农业社，却没有达到。于是成为当时一些人们的口实，认为那是“冒进”了，甚至在榆林报上引起了争论，县委在上级党委的支持下，驳斥了这种不正确的论点，坚决支持了群众的创举，继续让乡党委在与花园沟接连的韦家楼农业社试办千斤亩。最初，韦家楼社对花园沟水地亩产千斤也不大相信，他们说：“我们把力出尽了，才亩产八百八十斤，他们怎能打下千斤？”甚至有些社干竟认为：“花园沟不是亩大，就是虚报！”但是当他们暗地里步量了花园沟的几块水地，知道真相后，才大吃一惊。后来，在乡党委的引导下，韦家楼社检查了自己的工作，发现有五条赶不上花园沟社，这五条是：社支部领导赶不上，经营管理赶不上，肥料赶不上，灌溉赶不上，接受科学技术赶不上。接着就开展了学花园沟社，赶花园沟社的热潮。他们不但接受了花园沟社的先进经验，而且有了新的发展，终于在1957年达到水地亩产平均一千零一十二斤。从此，花园沟全沟变成了千斤沟。
    事在人为，只要敢于打破因循守旧的圈子，不甘心当自然的奴隶，很好地去发挥主观能动作用和大胆独创的精神，就有可能战胜自然。
    千斤沟的出现，说明被沙漠包围的沙滩地，增产潜力是很大的，变低产为高产是完全可能的。它对一切“地区论”、“条件论”者，是一个最生动、最有力的批判。它再一次使我们体会到：事在人为，只要敢于打破因循守旧的圈子，不甘心当自然的奴隶，很好地去发挥主观能动作用和大胆独创的精神，就有可能战胜自然。现在全县有水地的地区，已展开了学千斤沟、赶千斤沟的热潮，今年内除千斤沟要提高到亩产一千五百斤外，还计划新培养水地千斤镇一个，千斤乡一个，千斤沟一个，千斤社十四个，使亩产千斤的水地达到一万五千亩。
    千斤沟的出现，给正在同沙漠作斗争的人们，指出了一个美好的前景，它说明沙漠变良田后就可以出千斤。它大大地鼓舞了全县人民同沙漠作斗争的积极性。全县人民正运用着多年来所积累的丰富经验，向风沙展开了空前规模的斗争。根据我们的经验，要战胜沙漠，必须依靠群众，利用自然力量，采取“一物降一物”的办法，推广植治、风治、水治。植治，就是植树种草，绿化沙漠，固定沙丘。风治，就是把利用风力与植树种草结合起来，以草木控制沙丘移动地区，以风力削平沙丘。在沙丘北面迎风坡的退沙畔上，种植草木，作成屏障，使退沙保持在一定水平面上。在沙丘南面，距沙脚一、两丈远的地方种植草木，阻挡流沙，风吹沙起，退沙畔以上的流沙逐渐填平沙丘南的空地。群众把这种办法叫“前挡后拉，削平沙丘”。水治，有两种办法：一种是引水拉沙，先用人工开渠，引水至沙丘脚，以水冲沙，拉沙下流，逐步拉平沙丘，这种办法比人工平沙丘工效提高近千倍，三十里长的黑海子渠道就是用这种办法将大小数十个沙丘拉平了，使五千多亩沙荒地变成了水浇地；再一种办法是挖渠排水治碱化，上排下灌漫沙滩。现在我们正利用引水拉沙的办法，引水上沙梁，已开工的有两条渠道。一条由红花梁到镇川堡，长二百八十多里，一条是由排子湾到无定河上游，长一百一十多里，治沙面积最少在四十万亩以上，灌溉滩地和山地达三十多万亩。这两个工程今年内基本可以完工。我们坚信，在党的社会主义建设总路线的照耀下，沙漠里的千斤沟一定会在榆林遍地开花。
