    A French organization calling itself the "Paris District Public Salvation Committee," claiming to represent former resistance fighters, issued a communique on the 17th stating that unless De Gaulle comes to power and unless the Communist Party is immediately dissolved, they will go underground to fight as they did eighteen years ago.

    Would French former resistance fighters, who once fought heroically against Hitler's fascism, now support De Gaulle in carrying out a fascist coup? The answer is obviously no. The National Federation of Veterans of the Resistance Movement has issued a call for all former resistance fighters to work together to defend the Republic, which is a good proof.

    The "Paris District Public Salvation Committee," a fascist organization, is trying to win people's sympathy by falsely claiming to be former resistance fighters, which will undoubtedly have no effect. On the contrary, it reminds people of what happened eighteen years ago: at that time, Hitler seemed invincible, but the anti-fascist resistance movement ultimately won. Today, the power of the French people is much stronger than it was then, and they can even more use their own struggle to crush all fascist conspiracies.

    可耻的冒名者
    法国一个自称代表前抵抗战士的组织——“巴黎区救国委员会”在17日发出一份公报说：除非戴高乐上台，除非共产党立刻解散，否则他们将和十八年前一样转入地下进行斗争。
    曾经为反对希特勒法西斯而英勇斗争的法国前抵抗战士，现在会来支持戴高乐搞法西斯政变吗？答案显然是否定的。抵抗运动退伍军人全国联合会已经发出号召，要所有前抵抗战士协力保卫共和国，这就是很好的证明。
    “巴黎区救国委员会”这个法西斯组织企图冒用前抵抗战士的名义来博得人们的同情，无疑是不会有效果的。恰恰相反，这倒使人回忆起十八年前的往事：当时希特勒真是不可一世的样子，但是反法西斯的抵抗运动还是在最后取得了胜利。今天，法国人民力量已经比那时强大得多，他们就更可以用自己的斗争来粉碎一切法西斯阴谋。
