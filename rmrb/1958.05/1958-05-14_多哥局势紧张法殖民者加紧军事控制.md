    Xinhua News Agency, Lome, 13th. The situation in Togo (in West Africa), a French-mandated territory, is very tense recently. Because the "Progress Party," which supports French colonial policies, was greatly defeated in the legislative assembly election in late April, conflicts have repeatedly occurred between its members and supporters of the Togolese Unity Committee, which advocates independence and won a significant victory. In Lome, the capital of Togo, conflicts on the 11th alone resulted in one death and eight serious injuries.
    Under the pretext of "maintaining order," French colonialists are taking the opportunity to strengthen military control. They declared martial law from the 10th, and transferred a large number of troops from nearby French colonies. These troops patrolled the streets the day before yesterday and yesterday, forbidding people from holding public gatherings or assembling in groups.

    多哥局势紧张法殖民者加紧军事控制
    新华社13日讯　洛美消息：最近在法国的托管地多哥（在西非洲），局势非常紧张。因为支持法国的殖民政策而在4月下旬的立法议会选举中大败的“进步党”人，同主张独立而获得重大胜利的多哥统一委员会的拥护者屡次发生冲突。仅在11日一天在多哥首府洛美发生的冲突中，就有一人死亡，八人重伤。
    法国殖民者借口“维持秩序”，乘机加强军事控制。他们从10日起宣布戒严，并且从附近的法国殖民地增调来大批军队。这些军队前天和昨天都在街头上来往巡逻，不许人们举行公共集会，也不许成群结队。
