Large and Small Power Stations Spread Across the Land
This Year's New Installed Capacity Equals Half of the First Five-Year Plan

(Reported by this newspaper) The basic construction work of China's power industry has already shown a new situation of blossoming everywhere and a comprehensive leap forward. The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power plans to build and expand 88 large and medium-sized power stations across the country this year. It is estimated that the installed capacity this year will reach over 1.03 million kilowatts, equivalent to half of the installed capacity during the First Five-Year Plan. There are currently 31 transmission lines of 220,000 volts and 110,000 volts under construction, with a total length of 2,040 kilometers. A total of 81 projects were under construction simultaneously in the first quarter of this year. Provinces and cities across the country are also building a large number of small rural power stations through local investment, public-private partnerships, or private initiatives. It is estimated that the installed capacity of small rural power stations this year can reach 500,000 to 1 million kilowatts.

Among these construction projects are the Huanren Hydropower Station, Liaoning, Fuxin, and Dalian power stations to meet the needs of industrial and agricultural production development in the Northeast region; the Beijing Thermal Power Station, Tangshan Power Station, Shijingshan Power Station, Tianjin Power Station, and the reconstruction project of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan 110,000-volt power systems to support the industrial and agricultural development of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan regions; the Xin'anjiang Hydropower Station, Wangting Power Station, Xiaguan Power Station, and the 220,000-volt Jiangnan power system connecting Xin'anjiang, Shanghai, and Nanjing to meet the electricity needs of industry and agriculture in the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou regions; and the Baotou and Qingshan thermal power stations to support the Baotou and Wuhan iron and steel bases. The projects also include the Yili River Hydropower Station, Kaiyuan Power Station, Zhexi Hydropower Station, Zhuzhou Power Station, and the Southern Jiangxi Power Grid to support the Dongchuan Copper Mine, Gejiu Tin Mine, Xiangzhong Non-ferrous Metals, and Southern Jiangxi Tungsten Mine. Furthermore, there are the Luoyang Thermal Power Station, Harbin Thermal Power Station, Fularji Thermal Power Station, and Xi'an Thermal Power Station to support the Luoyang Tractor Factory, Harbin Turbine Factory, Electrical Machinery Factory, Boiler Factory, Fularji Heavy Machinery Factory, and Xi'an Electrical Equipment Manufacturing industry. Finally, there are the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station, Xigu, Fushun, Jilin, Taiyuan, and Chengdu thermal power stations to support the Lanzhou and Fushun petroleum industrial bases, Jilin and Jintang chemical fertilizer industries, and Taiyuan chemical industry.

These power stations include several large-scale regional power stations whose technical level and construction scale reach world standards, such as the Sanmenxia, Xin'anjiang, and Liujiaxia hydropower stations, and the Liaoning regional power station. The 220,000-volt transmission line from Tangshan to Jinzhou, which is planned to be built this year, will connect the Northeast and the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan power systems, greatly improving the power supply situation in these two regions.

While constructing large and medium-sized power stations, the masses in various parts of the country have established a large number of small power stations. The equipment capacity of these power stations is generally only 5 kilowatts, 10 kilowatts, or 20 kilowatts, and some can reach more than 100 kilowatts. These power stations are quick to build, have a fast return on investment, are technically simple, and use local materials, which plays a significant role in agricultural development.

In the first quarter of this year, workers made every effort to reduce costs, speed up the pace, and improve project quality. In terms of hydropower construction and thermal power construction, after mass discussions, they broke through the national plan indicators and proposed to strive for an installed capacity of 1.2 to 1.3 million kilowatts this year, and also increased the conservation targets. In order to accelerate the construction progress, more projects were added.

Due to the active efforts of the workers, the average cost during the Second Five-Year Plan will be reduced from 1,100 to 1,300 yuan per kilowatt in the first five years to 500 to 650 yuan. The construction period has also been greatly shortened. The total design and construction period of a typical medium-sized power plant has been shortened to about one year, and the construction period of a large hydropower station has been shortened from five or six years to three or four years.

    大电站小电站遍布四方
    今年新增装机容量相当第一个五年计划的一半
    本报讯　我国电力工业的基本建设工作，已经出现了一个遍地开花、全面跃进的新局面。水利电力部今年计划在全国各地新建和扩建八十八个大型和中型电站。预计今年的装机容量达到一百零三万瓩以上，相当于第一个五年计划装机设备能力的一半。现在正在建设二十二万伏和一十一万伏的送电线路三十一条，总长度二千零四十公里。今年第一季度同时施工的工程共有八十一项；全国各省市也正以地方投资、民办公助或者民办的形式，建设大量的小型农村电站，农村小型电站今年的装机容量预计可以达到五十到一百万瓩。
    在这些建设项目中，有为配合东北地区发展工农业生产需要的桓仁水电站，辽宁、阜新和大连等电站。有配合北京、天津、唐山地区工农业发展的北京热电站、唐山电站、石景山电站、天津电站和北京、天津、唐山一十一万伏电力系统的改建工程。有配合上海、南京、杭州地区工农业用电需要的新安江水电站、望亭电站、下关电站和连接新安江、上海、南京的二十二万伏的江南电力系统。有配合包头、武汉钢铁基地的包头、青山热电站。为配合东川铜矿、个旧锡矿、湘中有色金属、赣南钨矿的以礼河水电站，开远电站、柘溪水电站、株洲电站、赣南电力网等。为了配合洛阳拖拉机厂、哈尔滨汽轮机厂、电机厂、锅炉厂、富拉尔基重型机器厂、西安电器设备制造工业的洛阳热电站、哈尔滨热电站、富拉尔基热电站、西安热电站。还有配合兰州、抚顺石油工业基地、吉林、金堂化学肥料工业、太原化学工业的刘家峡水电站、西固、抚顺、吉林、太原、成都等热电站。
    这些电站中，包括若干在技术水平和建设规模达到世界水平的大型区域电站，例如三门峡、新安江、刘家峡等水电站和辽宁区域电站都是。今年计划建设的从唐山到锦州的二十二万伏送电线路，建成以后，将东北和（北）京、（天）津、（唐）山、电力系统连成一片，可以大大改进这两个地区的供电状况。
    在建设大中型电站的同时，全国各地群众兴办了大量的小型电站，这些电站的设备能力一般只有五瓩、十瓩、二十瓩，有的可到一百瓩以上。这些电站建设快、投资收回快、技术简单、就地取材，对于农业发展作用很大。
    今年第一季度，职工们千方百计地降低造价、加快速度、提高工程质量。在水电建设和火电建设方面，经过群众讨论，打破了国家计划的指标，提出争取今年装机一百二十到一百三十万瓩，并提高了节约指标。为了加速建设进度，还增加了工程项目。
    由于职工们的积极努力，在第二个五年计划中，平均造价将由第一个五年的每瓩一千一百元到一千三百元降低到五百到六百五十元。建设的工期也大大缩短，一般中型电厂设计施工总工期缩短到一年左右，大型水电站建设工期由五、六年缩短到三、四年。（附图片）
