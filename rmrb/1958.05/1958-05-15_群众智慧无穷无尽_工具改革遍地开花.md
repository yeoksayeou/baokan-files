　　The Wisdom of the Masses is Endless, Tool Reform is Flourishing Everywhere
　　Wooden Three-Tooth Weeding Hoe
　　Created by Jinan City XinJian Wood Factory, Shandong Province.
　　Except for the hoe teeth and screws, which are still made of steel, the remaining parts are made of wood. It saves labor for both people and animals and can increase work efficiency by about 30%. The cost is six yuan lower than steel products.
　　Lightweight Fertilizer Seeder
　　Created by the Huoguang Agricultural Cooperative, Lugezhuang, Ye County, Shandong Province. Used for topdressing fertilizer and interplanting crops such as millet and sorghum between rows.
　　During operation, the fertilizer or seeds flow out of the seed discharge port driven by the crank rotating with the guide wheel.
　　One person pushing it can fertilize one mu per hour, increasing efficiency five times compared to the original topdressing method.
　　Four-Purpose Weeding Hoe
　　Modified by Li Shuqing, a member of the Gecun Agricultural Cooperative, Wuji Township, Wu'an County, Hebei Province. It can not only sow grain and cotton but also cultivate, fertilize, and control pests, especially effective in cotton-growing areas.
　　It is modified based on a three-tooth weeding hoe and is mainly divided into four parts:
　　1. Sowing Part: The seed box has a mixer, and the bottom of the box has a seeder and a seed delivery tube.
　　2. Pressing Part: The pressing wheel is made of wood, connected with iron plates, and has a lifting rod at the handle.
　　3. Transmission Part: The transmission shaft is driven by a guide wheel and a chain. The two ends of the shaft drive two seed discharge gears to achieve automatic seeding.
　　4. Chicken Feather Powder Wheel: Made of a round wooden cylinder. Small holes are drilled around the cylinder, covered with a layer of wire mesh. Square holes are opened at both ends to fit on the square shaft, and a round hole is opened at one end for filling powder. After the powder is filled, the hole is sealed. Chicken feathers are wrapped around the wire mesh. During operation, as the four-purpose weeding hoe moves forward, the middle wheel rotates due to friction, driving the square shaft through a wooden gear. The rotation of the square shaft causes the chicken feather wheel to rotate as well. During rotation, the powder passes from the holes through the wire mesh onto the chicken feathers. At the same time, it presses the cotton seedlings forward. The powder on the chicken feathers is brushed onto the back of the cotton leaves. As the chicken feather wheel rolls past the cotton seedlings, the elasticity of the seedlings and the continuous forward rolling of the wheel help to lift the seedlings while brushing the powder on the other side of the cotton leaves. Each day, one head of livestock and two or three people can cultivate, fertilize, and control pests on fifteen mu. When sowing, the pest control part is removed. The tool is utilized throughout spring and summer, with high utilization rate.
　　Modified Three-Tooth Weeding Hoe
　　Modified by the Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative, Daying Township, Shan County, Henan Province, at a cost of three yuan. It can cultivate twenty mu a day.
　　Modification methods: 1. Add a seeder hopper for cultivating, fertilizing, and sowing. 2. Add a soil-covering board. 3. Modify the hoe teeth, extending the side cutter bar by two inches, with the tip shaped like an arrowhead. It is most suitable for the first deep hoeing during the seedling stage, generally hoeing three inches deep. 4. Add a seedling protection board. After the cotton seedlings grow taller, it can also be used for cultivating and weeding to avoid damaging the seedlings. 5. Add a soil-returning board for intercropping.

### 群众智慧无穷无尽  工具改革遍地开花

　　群众智慧无穷无尽  工具改革遍地开花
　　木制三齿耘锄
    山东济南市新建木器厂创造。
    除锄齿和各部螺丝仍用钢材外，其余部件均用木料。人畜省力，能提高工作效率30％左右。成本比钢铁制品低六元。
　　轻便化肥耧
    山东掖县路格庄火光农业社创造。用于追施化肥及行间套种谷子、高粱等作物。
    工作时靠导轮滚动带动曲柄，使化肥或种子从排种口流出。
    一人手推每小时可施一亩，比原追肥提高效率五倍。
　　四用耘锄
    河北武安县午汲乡格村农业社社员李树青改装。不仅能播种粮食、棉花，而且还能中耕兼施肥与治虫，特别在棉花地区效果更为显著。
    它是在三齿耘锄的基础上改装的，主要分四个部分：
    1、排种部分：种籽箱内有搅拌器，箱底有排种器、输种管。
    2、镇压部分：镇压轮是木制，用铁板连接，手柄处有升降杆。
    3、传动部分：传动轴是导轮带动链子传动的，轴的两端带动两个排种齿轮，达到自动排种。
    4、鸡毛刷粉轮：为一圆木筒制成。圆筒之周围钻有小孔，上面包一层铁丝网，两端各开一方孔套在方轴上，并在一端开一圆孔作装药粉时用，药粉装好后将孔堵死。在铁丝网上绕有鸡毛，工作时由于四用耘锄向前进，中间一轮则由于磨擦的关系而转动，经一木齿轮带动方轴转动，由于方轴转动因而鸡毛轮也随之转动。转动时一方面药由孔中经铁丝网到鸡毛上；另一方面在转动时将棉苗压倒向前方，于是鸡毛上的药粉便刷在棉叶的背面，而当鸡毛轮刚滚过棉苗后，由于棉苗本身的弹力作用，有一力量向上，再加上鸡毛轮继续向前滚动，就起着将棉苗扶起的作用，同时又把鸡毛上的药粉刷于另一边棉叶的背面。每天一头牲口、二人或三人中耕兼作施肥治虫十五亩。播种时去掉治虫部分就行了。一件农具春夏不闲，利用率高。
　　改装三齿耘锄
    河南陕县大营乡红星农业社改装，改装费三元。一天可中耕二十亩。
    改装方法：1、加装耧斗，可进行中耕施肥、播种。2、加装培土板。3、改装锄齿，比原来侧刀杆延长二寸，尖端是箭头形。在幼苗期进行第一次深锄时最为适宜，一般可锄三寸深。4、加装护苗板。在棉苗长高以后，还可以进行中耕锄草，以免碰伤棉苗。5、加装复土板。可以套种。
