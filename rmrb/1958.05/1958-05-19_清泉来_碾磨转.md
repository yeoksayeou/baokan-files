　　Clear Spring Comes, Mill Turns

　　(Reported by our newspaper) The Zhanxin Township in Yidu County, Hubei Province, recently built a hydraulic automatic processing factory. It can mill 2,000 jin of rice, pound 600 jin of rice, husk 6,000 jin of rice, sift 6,000 jin of rice, grind 700 jin of flour, and produce 28 dan of grass paper every day. It can save more than 40,000 labor days and more than 3,000 animal power days throughout the year, solving the labor shortage problem in the great leap forward in agriculture.
　　This processing factory has eight kinds of tools, including rice mills, grass mills, rice mortars, waist mills, hullers, winnowers, sieves, and flour sifters. It uses spring water flowing down from the mountain to drive the water turbine as power, and then the water turbine drives the millstone. The central column and belt of the millstone drive the huller and other tools.
　　The total investment of this factory is more than 3,000 yuan.
　　Zao Duan Cooperative in Luozi Tuan Township, Longhui, Hunan, built a hydraulic joint processing factory.
　　They drove piles and built dams in the small river, and installed a wooden water turbine drum with a diameter of eight feet at a water level of two feet high. A traction belt was installed on the shaft to drive a cotton gin. Three small gears were connected to the gears of the cotton gin, which were respectively installed with a water mill, a Luo sieve, and a cotton carding machine. When the water power is large or there is no cotton processing, rice milling, oil pressing and other machinery can also be installed. According to the trial use, it can grind 500 jin of flour, sift 300 jin of flour, gin 200 jin of cotton, and card more than 100 jin of cotton a day. The construction of this factory only used seventy or so workers and fifty or so pieces of timber, and the added cotton gin, cotton carding machine, and water mill only cost more than 200 yuan.

　　清泉来  碾磨转
    本报讯　湖北省宜都县崭新乡最近建成一座水力自动加工厂，每天可碾米二千斤、舂米六百斤、砻谷六千斤、筛米六千斤、磨面七百斤、生产草纸二十八担，全年能节省劳力四万多个，畜力三千多个，解决了农业大跃进中劳力不足的困难。
    这座加工厂内有米碾、草碾、米碓、腰磨、砻子、风斗、筛子、箩柜等八种工具。利用山上流下的泉水冲动水轮作动力，再由水轮带动碾盘、又由碾盘的中柱和皮带带动砻子及其他工具。
    这个厂共投资三千多元。
    湖南隆回骡子团乡造端社兴建了一座水力联合加工厂。
    他们在小河里打桩筑坝，在两尺高水位的地方，安装了一个直径八尺的木质水轮鼓，轴上装牵引皮带，带动一部轧花机，轧花机齿轮上接连衔接三个小齿轮，分别安装水磨、罗筛和弹花机，水力大或没有棉花加工时还可安装碾米、榨油等机械。根据试用情况，一天可以磨粉五百斤、筛粉三百斤、轧花两百斤、弹花一百多斤。兴建这座工厂，只用了七十来个工和五十来根木材，添置的轧花机、弹花机、水磨也只用去两百多元。
