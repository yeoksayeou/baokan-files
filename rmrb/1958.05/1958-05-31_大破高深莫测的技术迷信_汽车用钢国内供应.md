Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 30th (Reporter Chen Zilin) reports: China's independent steel system for the automobile industry has begun to be established. In the rectification movement, the workers of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant broke down technical superstitions and actively used domestic resources, increasing the proportion of domestically supplied metal materials used in automobile production from 20% at the beginning of operations to the current 90%; the supply of domestic steel has also leaped from 49% last year to over 80%.

　　In the early stage of production, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's use of foreign materials for small-batch production was suitable for the requirements at that time. However, as automobile production increased, it was no longer possible to rely solely on imported materials. In the first half of last year, according to the Ministry of First Machine Building Industry's instruction to develop automobile production by relying on domestic resources in every possible way, the factory conducted a comprehensive survey of the production of steel mills across the country and reached agreements with some steel mills for fixed sources of supply. The excessively high or unnecessary provisions in the original technical regulations were also appropriately revised or revoked in light of the specific domestic situation. However, the leadership did not boldly organize comprehensive experiments with alternative materials, and as a result, only 49% of the steel used last year was domestically supplied.

　　After the start of the rectification movement, especially with the in-depth development of the "Double-Anti" movement, the factory's technical personnel focused on criticizing dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thinking, breaking with conventions, and boldly and comprehensively conducting various experiments with alternative materials, paving the way for China to fundamentally establish a permanent steel system for automobiles. The technical personnel of the Metallurgical Department comprehensively analyzed and compared the technical requirements of all alloy steel parts on the Liberation brand automobile with the steel used in automobiles in other countries, and then, based on domestic resource conditions, boldly tried to use domestic chromium-manganese-titanium alloy steel to replace imported nickel-chromium steel, and nickel-free chromium cast iron to replace nickel-chromium cast iron. These substitute metals have now been successfully tested, and the wear resistance of various automobile parts produced with these substitute metals fully meets the technical requirements. Due to the adoption of substitute metals, the nickel consumption per vehicle has now been reduced from 6.7532 kg to 0.0164 kg. Based on the factory's annual production of 30,000 vehicles, the country can save more than 200 tons of nickel per year; more than a dozen automobile parts originally produced with 40 chromium steel are now produced with nickel-free manganese steel and carbon steel, which can maintain the original performance of each vehicle and save 50% of the chromium steel; the ST52 low-carbon silicon-manganese steel recently trial-produced by Anshan Iron and Steel instead of titanium alloy steel to manufacture automobile beams has even better strength than imported steel.

　　In this creative activity of fully utilizing domestic resources to replace imported precious metals, the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's experiments with using ordinary steel to replace high-quality steel, hot-rolled steel to replace cold-rolled steel, and aluminum to replace copper to manufacture many automobile parts have also been successful. The stamping workshop has also replaced more than 300 parts that are not subject to high stress and do not require high stamping performance with domestic hot-rolled steel plates instead of imported cold-rolled steel plates.

　　Appropriately change the design while ensuring quality. In the past, some designers, starting from maintaining their personal technical "honor," did not dare to change some parts that needed to be modified and could be modified. In this rectification movement, after politics took command and conservative thinking was opposed, a style of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to act, and daring to do was established. Based on the use of Liberation brand automobiles in various places, they resolutely changed the design of more than 30 parts. At the same time, by changing the structure of the parts, thinning or reducing some overweight parts, they reduced the weight of the car, and it is estimated that each car can be reduced by 150 kg this year. For example, each car was originally designed with a set of towing devices weighing 30 kg. Now, according to user feedback, the towing devices have been partially removed, which can save more than 800 tons of steel per year.

### 大破高深莫测的技术迷信  汽车用钢国内供应

    大破高深莫测的技术迷信
    汽车用钢国内供应
    据新华社长春30日电　记者陈子林报道：我国汽车工业的独立的用钢系统已开始建立起来。第一汽车制造厂的职工在整风运动中，破除技术迷信，主动使用国内资源，已使生产汽车的八百多种金属材料中，国内供应的比重由开工初期的20％达到了目前的90％；国内钢材的供应量也由去年的49％跃进到80％以上。
    第一汽车厂在开工生产初期，采用国外材料进行小批生产是适合当时要求的。但是随着汽车产量的日益增加，已不能单纯依靠进口材料了。去年上半年，这个厂根据第一机械工业部千方百计依靠本国资源发展汽车生产的指示，对全国冶金厂的生产作了全面调查，并且同部分钢厂达成了固定货源的协议。对原来技术条文中过高或不必要的规定，也结合国内具体情况适当修订或撤销。但是，领导上没有大胆组织代用材料的全面试验，因而，去年国内供应的钢材只达到49％。
    整风运动开始，特别是双反运动深入发展以后，厂内技术人员着重批判了教条主义和右倾保守思想，打破陈规，大胆地全面地进行各种代用材料的试验，为我国从根本上建立永久性的汽车用钢系统开辟道路。冶金处的技术人员把解放牌汽车上所有合金钢零件的技术要求，同其他国家汽车用钢情况作了全面分析比较，然后根据国内资源条件，大胆试用国产铬锰钛合金钢代替进口的镍铬钢，用无镍的铬铸铁代替镍铬铸铁。现在这些代用金属已经试用成功，用这些代用金属生产的各种汽车零件，其耐磨性能完全达到技术要求。由于采用了代用金属，现在每辆汽车的耗镍量已由六点七五三二公斤降到零点零一六四公斤，按全厂年产三万辆汽车计，一年就可以为国家节约二百多吨镍；原用40铬钢生产的十多种汽车零件，现在改用不含铬的锰钢和碳钢以后，每辆汽车既可保持原有性能，又节约了50％的铬钢；用鞍钢最近试制成功的ST52低碳矽锰钢代替钛合金钢制造汽车大梁，其强度比进口的还好。
    在充分利用本国资源代替进口贵重金属的这一创造性活动中，第一汽车厂试验用普通钢代优质钢，用热轧钢代冷轧钢，用铝代替铜来制造许多汽车零件，也获得成功。冲压车间也把三百多种受力不大、冲压性能要求不高的零件，改用国产热轧钢板代替进口的冷轧钢板来制造。
    在保证质量的情况下，适当更改设计。过去有些设计人员从维护个人技术上的“荣誉”出发，对有些需要修改又能够修改的零件，也不敢更动。这次整风中政治挂帅，反对了保守思想以后，敢想、敢说、敢作、敢为的风格树立起来，他们根据解放牌汽车在各地使用情况，坚决地更改了三十多种零件设计。同时，他们通过更改零件结构、减薄或减少一些过重零件的办法，减轻汽车的体重，预计今年每辆汽车可以减轻一百五十公斤。如原设计每辆汽车都带有一套重达三十公斤的拖曳装置，现在根据用户意见，部分地减去了拖曳装置，一年就可以节约钢材八百多吨。
