　　Jiangxi's Uphill Cadres Achieve Great Success; Farmers Praise Them as Skilled in Both Civil and Military Pursuits

　　(Our reporter Li Lianbin reports) In the past five months, cadres in Jiangxi Province who have gone uphill have achieved remarkable results in tempering and transforming themselves, changing social customs, and creating wealth for the country. The cadres describe their gains from going down to the countryside for training as: "People and mountains change together, with ideological and production harvests."

　　When the cadres first went uphill, some people in the mountainous areas doubted that the cadres could handle the heavy physical labor of the mountains, saying, "Cadres are good at civil affairs but not military affairs." However, seeing the cadres brave the wind and snow to chop bamboo, carry logs, build thatched huts, reclaim wasteland, plant trees, and repair forests as soon as they arrived, they secretly praised, "Whether they can do it or not, it's good that they are willing to work!" The cadres not only worked themselves but also closely connected with the masses, worked alongside them, learned production techniques and knowledge from them, and carried out labor competitions with them. At first, when two cadres competed with one farmer, the cadres worked shirtless and sweating in the severe cold, but they still couldn't beat the farmer. However, the cadres were not deterred. They proposed: Zhang Fei fought Ma Chao at night; we fight God at night. They worked valiantly in the dark and moonlight, and nature was finally subdued. They surpassed the farmers one after another, even the female comrades surpassed the farmers. Many female comrades in the Huanggangshan Reclamation Farm chopped fifty or sixty bamboo stalks a day, which was more than the average farmer. The farmers finally gave a thumbs-up: "The Communist Party cadres are skilled in both civil and military pursuits."

　　In production and construction, the uphill cadres often closely contacted the masses and cared about their well-being. The cadres helped the masses carry water, sweep courtyards, run night schools to teach the masses to read and learn culture, and treat the masses' illnesses. A farmer's son in Damau Mountain suddenly fell ill with a high fever, and his condition was very serious. The doctor from the Damau Mountain Reclamation Farm rushed dozens of miles to treat him overnight and cured the child's illness without taking a break during the Spring Festival. Later, the farmer brought chickens and led his son to the reclamation farm to thank them, wanting to hand over his son to the reclamation farm. He said, "This child was saved by the Communist Party; he is the son of the Communist Party."

　　When the cadres went uphill, they were warmly welcomed by the people in the mountainous areas. At that time, the uphill cadres expressed their determination to work hard, make achievements, and hear the second applause from the people in the mountainous areas. Now they have heard the second applause from the people in the mountainous areas. In the past five months, the heroic labor of the uphill cadres has turned the thousand-year-old sleeping barren mountains around, restored the youth of the abandoned hills, and given new life to the self-growing and self-extinguishing vegetation. According to incomplete statistics, the reclamation farms have reclaimed 100,000 mu of wasteland, sown rice, soybeans, wheat, and various vegetables; afforested more than one million mu of pine, fir, and other timber forests; and planted tens of millions of various fruit trees such as pears, oranges, tangerines, and grapes, as well as various economic forests such as tung trees, tea trees, and oil tea trees; and started to build more than two hundred small factories using various wild plants as raw materials for papermaking, winemaking, and other industries. The entire mountain is covered with cogongrass and bamboo shoots, which have become the best raw materials for papermaking, and a large number of chestnuts, bayberries, grapes, and other fruits will be produced. In addition, many reclamation farms have raised fine-wool sheep, Angora long-haired rabbits, pigs, dairy cows, and other livestock, and some reclamation farms have also raised fish. The Saicheng Lake Reclamation Farm alone has raised 150 million fish. The hard work of the cadres has created a large amount of wealth for the country. Taking only the Saicheng Lake Reclamation Farm's fish farming as an example: if 150 million fish survive to the end of this year with 50 million surviving, and each 50 fish is worth one yuan, it will create one million yuan of wealth for the country.

　　Mountainous production and construction are developing rapidly, and the face of the mountainous areas is also changing rapidly. Post and telecommunications, schools, and department stores have all gone uphill, and the construction of two hundred small hydropower stations in mountainous areas has begun to be planned. Some reclamation farms have built thermal power plants to solve the power and lighting problems for the large-scale development of mountainous industries. All of the more than one hundred reclamation farms will be accessible by car by the end of this year, and the Jinggangshan Highway will be completed by "July 1st" this year. The barren mountainous areas will soon be transformed, and a prosperous and happy picture of the new socialist mountainous areas is beginning to be presented to the people in the mountainous areas. The people in the mountainous areas have asked to join the reclamation farms and build new mountainous areas together with the cadres. Some farmers in Huanggangshan who wanted to move down the mountain in the past are no longer moving, and some are moving up the mountain. "In the past, good girls would not marry mountain men, but now they prefer to marry mountain brothers." Social customs have changed greatly.

　　After five months of labor training, the uphill cadres have gained a lot of production technology knowledge, and the situation of "not distinguishing between the five grains" has changed. Some comrades who suffered from headaches, stomach problems, and neurasthenia have recovered. They said, "The mountain is a reclamation farm, a school, and also a sanatorium." The responsible comrade of the Jinggangshan Reclamation Farm said, "The whole farm is full of strong and energetic people, forming a new situation of ideological great leap forward, physical great leap forward, and production great leap forward." The nicknames "thousand gold," "miss," "bread," and "balloon" that were circulating when they first went uphill have been replaced by new nicknames such as "iron ball," "water buffalo," "locomotive," and "strongman."

　　Currently, the uphill cadres have put forward the resounding slogan of being both red and expert, making a great march towards science and culture, and thoroughly changing the face of the mountainous areas, filled with communist spirit, and determined to fight for the long-term construction of the mountainous areas. The Jiangxi Provincial Party and government leading organs, in order to adapt to the requirements of the technological revolution and cultural revolution for mountainous construction and the development of mountainous economy, have decided to establish one hundred and fifteen labor middle schools, thirteen labor universities, and one hundred and fifteen scientific research institutions. Based on the principle of combining theory with practice, combining theory with practice, combining labor and learning, and combining learning with application, teaching and scientific research work will be carried out. In this way, the uphill cadres are laborers, teachers, and scientific researchers. Tens of thousands of cadres going uphill have opened up the road for the construction of mountainous areas in Jiangxi, and the technological revolution and cultural revolution will rapidly lead the construction of mountainous areas to the highest peak.

    人和自然一齐变　思想生产双丰收
    江西上山干部成绩好　农民夸他们文也行武也行
    本报讯　记者李连斌报道：江西省上山干部五个月中不论在锻炼改造自己，转移社会风气和为国家创造财富方面都取得了十分显著的成绩。干部们形容自己下放锻炼的收获是：“人与山一齐变，思想生产双丰收。”
    干部开始上山时，部分山区人民怀疑干部担承不了山区的繁重的体力劳动，说：“干部文行、武不行。”但是看到干部一上山就迎风浴雪地砍竹子、扛木头、搭茅棚、开荒、栽树、修林，则暗中赞叹：“行不行，肯干就好呀！”干部不但自己劳动，并密切联系群众，和群众一道劳动，向群众学习生产技术和生产知识，和群众开展劳动竞赛。开始时两个干部和一个农民比，在严寒中干部们打赤膊、汗流浃背地干，还是赛不过农民。可是难不倒干部，他们提出：张飞夜战马超，我们夜战上帝。他们在黑夜中、月光下英勇地劳动，大自然终于驯服了，他们赛过了农民，一个赛过了一个，连女同志也赛过了农民。黄岗山垦殖场许多女同志一天砍五、六十根竹子，比一般农民砍得多。农民终于竖起大姆指头：“共产党的干部文行武也行。”
    上山干部在生产建设中经常密切联系群众，关心群众疾苦。干部们帮助群众挑水、扫院子，办夜校教群众识字学文化，为群众治病。大茅山有一个农民的儿子突然患病，发高烧，病情很严重。大茅山垦殖场的医生连夜赶几十里路前去治疗，春节没有休假把孩子的病治好了。后来那个农民带着鸡、领着儿子到垦殖场致谢，要把儿子交给垦殖场。他说：“这个孩子是共产党救活的，是共产党的儿子。”
    干部上山时受到山区人民群众的热烈鼓掌欢迎，当时上山干部就表示努力生产，作出成绩，要听到山区人民的第二次鼓掌，现在他们听到了山区人民的第二次掌声。五个月来，上山干部英勇劳动的结果，使千年沉睡的荒山翻了身，荒废的山岗恢复了青春，自生自灭的草木有了新的生命。据不完全统计，各垦殖场开荒达十万亩，播种了稻子、大豆、小麦和各种菜蔬；营造松、杉等用材林一百多万亩；种植梨、桔、柑和葡萄等各种果木及桐、茶和油茶等各种经济林木上千万株；着手兴建利用各种野生植物作原料的造纸、制酒等各种小型工厂二百多座。满山遍野的芭茅草、笋壳等都成为造纸的最好的原料，板栗、杨梅、葡萄等水果洒将大批生产。此外，许多垦殖场饲养了细毛羊、安哥拉长毛免、生猪、奶牛等牲畜，有些垦殖场还养了鱼。只赛城湖垦殖场就养鱼一亿五千万尾。干部们的辛勤劳动为国家创造了大量的财富。仅就赛城湖垦殖场养鱼一项计算：一亿五千万尾鱼到今年底以成活五千万尾计，每五十尾一元钱，就为国家创造一百万元的财富。
    山区生产建设在迅速地发展，山区的面貌也在迅速地改变。邮电、学校、百货商店都上了山，二百座山区小型水电站开始计划兴建，有的垦殖场修建了火电厂，解决大量发展山区工业的动力和照明问题，一百多个垦殖场今年年底全部可通汽车，井冈山公路今年“七一”就可竣工。荒凉的山区很快就变样了，一幅繁荣的、幸福的社会主义的新山区的图景开始摆在山区人民的面前了。山区人民纷纷要求参加垦殖场和干部一道建设新山区。黄岗山过去有些农民想搬下山的现在不搬了，有的并往山上搬了。“过去好女不嫁山中郎，现在偏与山哥结成双。”社会风气大大改变了。
    上山干部们经过五个月的劳动锻炼，增长很多生产技术知识，“五谷不分”的情形改变了，一些闹头痛、患胃病和神经衰弱的同志都好了。他们说：“山是垦殖场，是学校，也是疗养院。”井冈山垦殖场的负责同志说：“全场个个身强力壮精神爽，形成思想大跃进，身体大跃进，生产大跃进的新局面。”开始上山流传的“千金”“小姐”“面包”“汽球”等外号，被“铁球”“水牛”“火车头”“大力士”等新绰号代替了。
    目前上山干部提出红透专深，向科学文化大进军，彻底改变山区面貌的响亮口号，充满共产主义精神，决心为长期建设山区而奋斗。江西省党政领导机关适应技术革命和文化革命对山区建设、开发山区经济的要求，决定建立一百一十五所劳动中学、十三所劳动大学、一百一十五个科学研究机构。根据理论与实际相结合，理论与实践相结合，劳动和学习相结合、学与用相结合的原则，开展教学和科学研究工作。这样，上山干部是劳动者，又是教员，又是科学研究员。几万干部上山开辟了江西山区建设的道路，技术革命和文化革命将把山区建设迅速引向最高峰。
