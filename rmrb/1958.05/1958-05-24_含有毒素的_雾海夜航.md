    "Night Voyage in a Foggy Sea" Containing Toxins
    Jia Ji

    In April 1955, the passenger ship "Democracy No. 3" ran aground and encountered danger en route from Shanghai to Ningbo. This was a unique accident in the history of China's shipping industry. After this accident occurred, thanks to the wise measures of the Party and the government, the timely rescue by the People's Air Force and Navy, and the passengers' own composure and perseverance, especially the heroic and selfless actions of the People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters, more than a thousand people on board were unharmed and all escaped danger. This fully demonstrates the essence of our era's society, the superiority of our socialist system, and the high degree of moral unity of our people. This is a typical event that should be greatly publicized.

    However, right-wing elements took this opportunity to make trouble out of nothing, trying to take advantage of everyone's attention to display their tricks of "innuendo and accidental hits," in order to once again write negative articles, leading people to draw conclusions that are exactly the opposite of the facts.

    The directors and writers of the film "Night Voyage in a Foggy Sea" created it with such malicious intentions. Of course, during the filming process, the film's actors had some correct interpretations of their own; after the film was made, it was revised by the film studio; therefore, some individual scenes are still relatively moving; and some of the worst things have been cut out, which relatively reduces some of the harm. However, despite this, the toxins are still visible everywhere in the current finished product.

    Originally, throughout the entire course of the event, everyone knew that the Party's leadership was the main line and the decisive factor. The film's directors and writers tried every means to play tricks and obliterate this point; their most malicious method was to remove the concrete depiction of the Party's leadership, making the Party's leadership and the Party's power not only appear very empty but also distort and uglify them wantonly. For example, after the passenger ship "Democracy No. 3" had an accident, the ship's political commissar originally convened an emergency expanded meeting of the Party branch (the political commissar of a naval unit on board at the time was invited to participate), specifically guiding the self-rescue activities on the ship with the Communist Party members as the core. Precisely because of this, the rescue work on the ship was carried out in a step-by-step and orderly manner, achieving astonishing composure. However, on the "Sea Swallow" in the film, the ship's political commissar, this real and extremely persuasive character, simply did not exist, so the activities of the Party organization and the leading role of the Party were nowhere to be seen. This is on the one hand, on the other hand, the real character of a certain political commissar on the ship was tampered with beyond recognition, and he was pulled out to make a fool of himself. The audience cannot see where his Communist Party member's awareness is manifested, they only see him working alone, as if he is not relying on the Party's leadership and has no relationship with the Party organization on the ship, he relies on his own gritted teeth and desperate efforts, as if it is he personally who is playing all the decisive role! In front of the so-called blind professor, he appears so listless and vulgar: he not only "shows off" his own injuries to the blind professor, but also greatly compliments the professor, and accepts the commission to find a boyfriend for that female student, and finds the junior officer Zhou Dahai. Is this "praising"? This is a thorough manipulation, slander, and vilification!

    Speaking of Zhou Dahai, he is a sex maniac: he is so infatuated with the female student at first sight that in the most urgent moment of going on a small boat to seek help, his only action is to send a love letter to the female student, which is simply absurd. Equally absurd is a demobilized soldier, Platoon Leader Liu, who, after the ship accident in the film, shows such sadness and despair: crying and shouting loudly: "Motherland! Motherland! Can you hear me? Your children are calling you!" From these malicious exaggerations, can we see even a little bit of the real People's Liberation Army soldiers? The spearhead is not only aimed at the People's Liberation Army but also at all the people. This is his hostile depiction of all the people in the film: the old female worker becomes a miser, constantly muttering about "four boxes"; the female worker – the bride – becomes a "love-above-all-elseist," staring intently at her fiancé's photo; her fat sister is also a female worker, but she is always crying and weeping and doesn't look like a worker at all; a "pigtail" is even more fickle, very naive; as for the female student, who was originally a youth of the new era, is described as full of feudal morality, actually willing to remain unmarried for life to serve her teacher, but strangely enough, as soon as she sees Zhou Dahai, she also instantly becomes restless and starts to fall in love...

    Speaking of this, it must be pointed out that the director has a "hero" in mind who is above all else, and this is the blind professor, a senior bourgeois intellectual. What is the implication and function of this image? It is that the professor was forced to get sick and go blind, that is to say, he was "harmed" by our society; but, look, even this person is still so calm and talented: when the ship is gradually sinking and the sea water is flooding the ship, he completes his life-saving medical theory book! Isn't this a miracle? And, in contrast, aren't those Communist Party members, those People's Liberation Army commanders and fighters not as good as him? Not to mention those workers and peasants, what are they! From this, it can be seen that the blind professor, an image containing deep hostility, is precisely the director's best trick; and his malicious right-wing tricks are completely exposed at this point.

    含有毒素的“雾海夜航”
    贾霁
    1955年4月间，“民主三号”客轮在从上海至宁波途中触礁遇险。这在新中国的海运事业中是绝无仅有的一次事故。这次事故发生之后，由于党和政府的英明的措施，人民空军、海军的及时救援，和乘客自己的沉着坚毅，尤其是其中人民解放军指战员们英勇忘身的行动，轮船上的一千多人无一伤亡，全部脱险。这件事情充分显示了我们时代社会的本质、我国社会主义制度的优越性和我们人民高度的道义上的团结一致。这是具有典型意义的、应该大书特书的事情。
    然而右派分子却借此无事生非，想趁着大家都注意的机会，施展他那“旁敲侧击、歪打正着”等等鬼蜮技俩，以便再一次地做反面文章，使人们得出和事实恰恰相反的结论。
    影片“雾海夜航”的编导就是怀着这样恶毒的意图来创作的。当然，这部作品在拍摄过程中，该片演员有自己的一些正确的阐释；拍成以后，又经过制片厂删改；所以，某些个别场面，还比较地动人；而有些最坏的东西又剪掉了，也就相对地减轻了一些毒害。但是，尽管如此，现在的成品中，毒素仍然是随处可见的。
    原来，在事件发展的整个过程中，尽人皆知，党的领导是一条主线，是决定性的因素。影片的编导却千方百计地耍花招，要抹煞这一点；他最恶毒的手法就是：抽去了对党的领导的具体的描写，把党的领导、党的力量不但表现得十分空泛，并且肆意加以歪曲和丑化。例如：当时“民主三号”客轮出事之后，船上政委原是召开了党支部的紧急扩大会议（当时在船上的海军某部某政委是被邀请参加的），具体指导着轮船上以共产党员为核心的自救活动。正由于这样，船上抢救工作一直进行得有步骤、有秩序，达到惊人的镇定。但是，在影片里的“海燕号”上，船上政委、这个真实的有极大说服力的人物，却根本不存在了，从而党组织的活动、党的领导作用，也就一点影子都不见了。这是一方面，另一方面是把在船上的某政委这一真实人物篡改得面目全非，把他拉出来出洋相。观众看不见他的共产党员的自觉性表现在哪里，只见他单人独马地干起来，他竟然不依靠党的领导、跟船上的党组织不发生什么关系，他依靠他咬牙拼命、仿佛正是他个人在起一切决定性的作用！在所谓盲教授面前，他又显得那么精神不振、庸俗不堪：既对盲教授“摆”他自己的创伤，又大大地恭维教授一番，还接受委托去给那个女学生找对象，并且就找上了下级军官周大海。难道这是“歌颂”？这是彻头彻尾地在进行玩弄、诋毁和污蔑！
    说到周大海这个人物，则是一个色情狂：一见那个女学生就神魂颠倒，以至于在为求援而上小艇的最紧急的当儿，他唯一的行动是给女学生送上情书，简直是荒唐透顶，同样荒唐的，还有一个复员军人刘排长，在影片中轮船出事之后，竟表现得那样伤心绝望：哇哇地大哭大叫：“祖国！祖国！你听见了吗？你的儿女们在呼唤你！”从这些恶意的渲染里，我们能看得出我们人民解放军战士们一点点真实的东西吗？矛头不单指着解放军，同时也指着所有的人民群众。这就是他对影片中所有的人民群众充满敌意的描写：老女工成了一个守财奴，一直叨念着“四个箱子”；女工——新娘子成了一个“恋爱至上主义者”，一个劲地盯着未婚夫的照片；她的胖姐也是一个女工，却总是哭哭啼啼地根本不像个工人；一个“小辫子”更是哭笑无常，十分幼稚；至于那个女学生，本来是新时代的青年，却被描写为封建道德十足，居然要为侍奉老师而终身不嫁，然而却也怪，一见周大海，她也顷刻之间心猿意马，谈起恋爱来……
    说到这里，要指出编导者心目中有着一个超乎一切之上的“英雄”，这就是盲教授、一个资产阶级高级知识分子。这个形象的寓意和作用是什么？这就是：教授是被逼迫得害了病、瞎了眼的，就是说被我们社会“损害了”的；但是，看吧，就是这个人，最后还是那样镇静、那样才华焕发：在轮船渐渐下沉、海水漫上船来的时候，完成了他那救人命的医学理论著作！这不是奇迹吗？并且，相形之下，那些共产党员，那些解放军指战员也不是都不如他吗？更不用说那些工人农民群众，他们算什么！由此可见，盲教授这个蕴藏着很深的敌意的形象，正是编导者最拿手的一个好戏；而他的恶毒的右派伎俩至此也就完全暴露了。
