    Self-Contradiction

    On May 8th in West Berlin, Dulles warned West Germans "not to abandon nuclear deterrent defense forces because of the Soviet Union's alluring assurances," because "the leaders in the Kremlin are all atheistic materialists." Dulles here trotted out the moldy old "anti-atheist" rhetoric to frighten people.

    However, Dulles probably also knew that his blatant warmongering speech was unpopular. Therefore, he hypocritically expressed his desire to take reliable steps to reduce the possibility of war and eliminate "new weapons that actually threaten to destroy humanity."

    The Soviet Union has already stopped nuclear weapons testing, which, according to Dulles, is the Soviet Union's "alluring assurance." But the hydrogen bomb clouds over the Pacific high seas are the United States "striving for practical steps" to eliminate "new weapons that actually threaten to destroy humanity." In the face of ironclad facts, Dulles, this "theist," had to fall into a self-contradictory position.

    自相矛盾
    杜勒斯5月8日在西柏林警告西德人“不要由于苏联诱人的保证而放弃核威慑防御力量”，原因是“克里姆林的领袖都是无神论的唯物主义者”。杜勒斯在这里搬出臭得发霉的“反对无神论者”谰调来吓唬人了。
    不过，杜勒斯大概也知道他的这一露骨的好战演说是不得人心的。因此他又假惺惺地表示要求采取可靠步骤减少战争可能性和消除“有实际毁灭人类的威胁的新武器”。
    苏联已经停止了核武器试验，照杜勒斯的说法就是苏联的“诱人的保证”。而太平洋公海上空的氢弹污云，却是美国在“争取实际步骤”来消除“有实际毁灭人类威胁的新武器”。在铁的事实面前，杜勒斯这位“有神论者”不得不陷入自相矛盾的地步。
