　　Promote Privately-Run Film Projection Teams
　　Lin Bi
　　The Hongxing Agricultural Cooperative in Chiyangkou Township, Changli County, Hebei Province, the Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative in Jing'an Township, and the Wanhuzhijia Agricultural Cooperative in Shahe County have successively established their own film projection teams. This is a beautiful flower blooming in China's film projection industry along with the great leap forward in agricultural production.
　　Our films are an important component of socialist new culture, a powerful weapon for publicizing the policies of the Party and the government, and disseminating socialist ideology and scientific and cultural knowledge. The brilliant images of heroic figures in many films have become role models for the broad masses of people to learn from. Farmers in Hubei Province proposed to use the momentum of the "Million-Strong Army Crossing the Yangtze," the wisdom of the heroic figures in "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," the revolutionary spirit of the Volunteer Army in "Shangganling," and the brave spirit of "Dong Cunrui" to build water conservancy projects and achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. This shows that people are deeply inspired by the heroic figures in films.
　　Since liberation, China's rural film projection industry has grown significantly from scratch. By the end of 1957, the government's cultural system had more than 4,800 projection teams, with 820 million rural filmgoers. However, China has a vast territory and a large population, and the existing projection equipment and personnel are far from meeting the needs of the masses. In 1957, each farmer watched an average of only 1.5 films. The scarcity of film teams not only means that rural audiences watch fewer films, but also that screenings are not widespread, and people have to travel long distances to see a film, while some areas cannot see them at all. It is necessary to actively, planfully, and step-by-step develop the rural film projection industry to meet the needs of the situation.
　　In the past, the development of rural film projection teams was all funded by the government. With the development of agricultural production and the increase in the income of agricultural cooperatives, it is possible to promote both government-funded and agricultural cooperative-funded operations. This can reduce the state's investment and rapidly develop the rural film projection industry, so as to maximize the satisfaction of the broad masses of farmers' demand for more films. It can also make film screenings more closely coordinated with agricultural production and socialist publicity and education. This matter also proves that as long as the enthusiasm of the masses is mobilized and the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives is brought into play, the financial resources, manpower, and management issues required for the development of various cultural and artistic undertakings in rural areas can be resolved, thereby achieving more, faster, better, and more economical development of mass cultural and artistic activities in rural areas.

　　提倡民办电影放映队
　　林碧
    河北省昌黎县赤洋口乡红星农业社、靖安乡曙光农业社和沙河县万户之家农业社先后建立了自己的电影放映队。这是我国电影放映事业随着农业生产大跃进开放的一朵鲜花。
    我们的电影是社会主义新文化的重要组成部分，是宣传党和政府的政策、传播社会主义思想和科学文化知识的有力武器。不少影片中的英雄人物的光辉形象，成为广大人民学习的榜样。湖北省的农民提出要以“百万雄师下江南”的声势，“智取华山”中的英雄人物的智慧，“上甘岭”中的志愿军的革命干劲，“董存瑞”的勇敢精神来兴修水利，实现农业生产大跃进。由此可见，人们深深受到电影英雄人物的感染。
    解放以来，我国农村电影放映事业从无到有，有了很大的发展，到1957年底政府文化系统放映队已达四千八百余队，农村电影观众达八亿二千万人次。但是，我国地广人多，现有的放映设备力量还远远不能满足群众的需要，1957年平均每个农民只看到一点五次电影。电影队少不仅农村观众看的次数少，而且放映不普遍，群众看一次电影要走很远的路，有的地区则根本看不到。必须积极地、有计划、有步骤地发展农村电影放映事业，以适应形势的需要。
    过去，农村电影放映队的发展都是由政府投资举办的，随着农业生产的发展和农业社收入的增加，可以提倡由政府投资举办和农业社投资自办。这样做，既可以减少国家的投资而又可能迅速地发展农村电影放映事业，以便最大程度地满足广大农民多看电影的要求。也就可以使电影放映更紧密地配合农业生产和社会主义的宣传教育。从这一件事也可以证明：只要发动群众的积极性和发挥农业社的集体力量，就能解决发展农村各项文化艺术事业所需要的财力、人力和经营管理上的问题，从而做到又多、又快、又好、又省地开展农村群众文化艺术活动。
