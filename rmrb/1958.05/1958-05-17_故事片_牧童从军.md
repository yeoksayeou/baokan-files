Stage and Screen

    The feature film "The Cowherd Joins the Army" is adapted from Wu Qiang's novel "He Raised the Bright Little Pony Gun." The film reflects the heroic activities of the People's Army through the story of a child who herds cattle for a landlord and joins the Eighth Route Army.

    The young actor who plays the cowherd Li Xiaohu basically portrays the image of this strong, suffering child who has been tormented by life. When the audience sees him finally accepted into the army after many twists and turns, and wearing that slightly oversized uniform, they can't help but be moved. (Zhi)

    故事片“牧童从军”
    “牧童从军”是根据吴强的小说“他举起了雪亮的小马枪”改编的。影片通过一个给地主放牛的孩子参加八路军的故事，反映了人民军队的英勇活动。
    演牧童李小虎的小演员，基本上表现出这个受过生活的折磨的坚强的苦孩子的形象。当观众看到他几经波折，最后终于被接受入伍，穿上了那件稍嫌宽大的军装时，都不禁为之感动了。　（之）
