Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 21st. A symposium on seed work was recently held in Nanjing by the Ministry of Agriculture to study pressing issues related to seed breeding, storage, and pest control. Experts from agricultural research departments and cadres from seed management departments attended the symposium.

At the meeting, participants agreed that the great leap forward in agricultural production since last winter requires seed work to keep up even more closely. Therefore, in addition to identifying research topics related to seed problems, a Seed Science Research Collaboration Association was established.

Through the exchange of experiences, the symposium clarified some technical measures that can be immediately applied in production. The degeneration of potato varieties planted in spring is rapid in various regions, significantly affecting yields. However, Liaoning Province uses summer planting for seed retention, and the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins use double-cropping for seed retention, especially selecting relatively young seed potatoes, which can reduce degeneration. Regarding the breeding of improved varieties, research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' research institutions in Beijing suggests that the "Victory No. 100" sweet potato variety was originally a short and thick vine type, but it often produces long-vine, degenerative variants. When peasants cut vines in spring potato fields, they often use the early and long vines that emerge for planting, effectively selecting low-yielding plants as seeds, leading to degeneration. If peasants could be promptly guided to separately inspect the yields of long-vine and short-vine plants and recognize the benefits of using short-vine plants for seeds, the degeneration of potato seeds could be effectively prevented. Wheat also faces a similar situation, with each excellent variety frequently undergoing variations, causing improved varieties to become mixed and degenerate. Insisting on annually selecting plants of standard types from excellent varieties for seeds can maintain their original advantages. (Attached picture)

    科学家座谈种子问题
    据新华社南京21日电　农业部最近在南京召开的种子工作座谈会，研究了当前急待解决的种子繁育、贮藏和病虫害防治等问题。参加座谈的有农业科学研究部门的专家和种子主管部门的干部。
  会上，大家认为去冬以来农业生产大跃进，种子工作也必须进一步紧紧跟上去。因此除了确定种子问题的研究题目以外，并成立了种子科学研究协作会。
    座谈会通过交流经验，明确了一些在生产上马上可以应用的技术措施。各地春播马铃薯品种退化很快，大大影响产量。但是辽宁省用夏播方法留种，黄河和长江流域用二季作留种，特别是选用比较幼嫩的种薯作种，可以减少退化现象。在良种繁育问题上，中国科学院所属研究机构在北京的研究，认为胜利百号甘薯良种原是蔓短而粗的品种，但常常会先生出长蔓的退化性的变异类型。群众在春薯地上剪蔓，常因长蔓种伸出的蔓较早较长，剪用作种，实际上反而选用了低产类型的植株作种，引起退化，如能及时指导群众分别检查长蔓种和短蔓植株的产量，认识到剪用短蔓种作种的好处，就可有效地阻止薯种的退化。小麦也有同样情况，每个优良品种经常发生变异，使良种变得混杂退化。坚持每年选用优良品种标准类型的植株做种，就可以保持它们原来的优点。（附图片）
