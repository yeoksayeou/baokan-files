    Thousands Perform, Tens of Thousands Watch
    On the evening of May 3rd, Guangzhou municipal workers held a cultural performance with thousands of performers and tens of thousands of spectators at the Guangzhou Second Workers' Cultural Palace.
    More than 200 units and more than 2,000 people participated in the performance. Among them, the thousand-person chorus and the five-hundred-person Cantonese music ensemble were unprecedented in scale. The more than two-hundred-person Cantonese opera chorus was also very novel.
    On the same evening, a "Red May Concert" was also held in the Zhongshan Memorial Hall, where the "Pearl River Grand Chorus" sung by more than 200 people brought the concert to an exciting climax.

    千人演　万人看
    广州市职工3日晚上在广州第二工人文化宫举行了一个千人演、万人看的文艺大会演。
    参加演出的单位有二百多个、二千多人，其中千人大合唱和五百人的广东音乐大合奏规模之大都是过去少有的；二百多人的粤曲合唱也很新颖。
    同日晚，在中山纪念堂还举行了“红五月音乐会”，其中二百多人演唱的“珠江大合唱”把音乐会引向使人激动的高潮。
