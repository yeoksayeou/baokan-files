    Exert All Efforts to Learn Culture
    In the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, a mass campaign to eliminate illiteracy has been launched, striving to basically eliminate illiteracy this year. Activists in various regions are enthusiastically beating drums and gongs, going from house to house to mobilize illiterate people to study.
    Now, throughout the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone is actively participating in learning. People are doing everything possible to overcome difficulties such as lack of funds and equipment. They are using bed boards, door panels, and the ground as blackboards, using bamboo slips and banana leaves as paper, and using open spaces as classrooms. The peasants have great enthusiasm for learning culture. Whether at meetings, herding cattle, or going to market, they carry their textbooks with them, studying whenever they have a spare moment. They also write the characters they have learned on signs and hang them on the roadside fences when working in the fields, so that passers-by can review the characters they have learned. The teachers in the literacy classes are all volunteers, with young students being the most numerous. The elderly teachers are not to be outdone either; even in bad weather with wind and rain, they still support themselves with canes to mobilize others to attend literacy classes.
    The enthusiasm of the Vietnamese people for learning culture can also be seen in the folk songs:
    You and I go to the literacy class together,
    In the future, reading books, writing letters, and reading newspapers will no longer be difficult.
    That seemingly pretty girl,
    How can she marry a good husband if she is illiterate?

    鼓足干劲学文化
    越南民主共和国掀起了群众性的扫盲热潮，争取在今年基本上扫除文盲，各地积极分子敲锣打鼓挨家动员不识字的人去学习。
    现在，全国不分男女老少都积极参加了学习。人们想尽一切办法克服经费和设备缺乏等困难，他们用床板、门板、土地代替黑板，用竹简壳和香蕉叶代替纸张，用空地代替教室。农民学文化的干劲很大，不论是集会、放牛或赶集，他们都随身带着课本，一有空就学习。他们还把认识的字写在牌子上，下地干活时把它挂在路口的篱笆上，让过路的人都能温习学过的字。扫盲识字班的教员全是义务的，其中青年学生最多。老年教员也不甘示弱，即使在刮风下雨的坏天气里，他们仍然扶着手杖去动员别人到识字班上课。
    越南人民学文化的干劲从歌谣中也可以看出：
    你我同上识字班，
    今后看书、写信、读报再不难。
    那位看来俊俏的姑娘啊，
    不识字怎嫁好新郎。
