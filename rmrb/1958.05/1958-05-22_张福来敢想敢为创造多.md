Zhang Fulai, a draftsman at the Hefei Farm Implement Factory in Anhui Province, created the net grain computer, a three-wheeled wooden pedal waterwheel, a hand-operated suction cylinder waterwheel, and a hand-operated wooden Liberation waterwheel. These have become exhibits at the National Farm Implement Exhibition.

One night in October 1951, Zhang Fulai was checking grain warehouses outside (at the time, he was working at the Fuyang Grain Station). They were walking against the wind, which made them stagger. Suddenly, he had an idea: "Wouldn't it be good to use wind power?" Thus, during the years he worked in Fuyang, he used countless nights to research and design tools such as a windmill, a three-wheeled pedal waterwheel, a mobile water pumping machine, a sweet potato planting machine, and a net grain computer.

When he was researching these things, he encountered many difficulties. Some people mocked him as "daydreaming" and being too "overconfident," calling him an "expert," which made him very upset! At this time, it was Chairman Mao's "On Contradiction" that supported him. The sentence in "On Contradiction" that "nothing in the world develops in absolute balance" gave him great inspiration: Right! People's thoughts are the same. Some people dare to think ahead, and some people don't dare to think ahead. He kept this sentence of Chairman Mao's in his heart as a weapon to attack conservative thinking!

By the end of 1955, the eight kinds of farm implements he had researched and created were generally taking shape, but the county lacked funds to manufacture and test them. He wrote a letter to the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and sent the drawings of various tools. The Party supported him. Comrade Zeng Xisheng, the Provincial Party Secretary, met with him and transferred him to the Hefei Farm Implement Factory, instructing the factory to help him first use wood to trial-produce a net grain computer for testing.

The net grain computer was created at the end of 1956 – the one exhibited at the exhibition. The test proved it was successful. This machine, with all its gears made of wood, had an error of only 0.047% when calculating the quantity of grain. During the appraisal, people from several departments gave him opinions on improving several devices and asked him to build another one for testing.

Rebuilding it brought problems. Improving several devices required drawings, but Zhang Fulai didn't know how to draw. When the first one was being built, an engineering technician in the factory with serious conservative ideas made things difficult for Zhang Fulai with drawings. He didn't believe that Zhang's net grain computer could succeed, but he didn't dare not build it, so he asked Zhang Fulai, who didn't know how to draw, to submit construction drawings. In addition, the factory did not have trial production funds. Therefore, it was not until July 1956, under the inspection and supervision of the Party Committee, that they had to start manufacturing. This time, when asked to rebuild it, he used the old trick again. Zhang Fulai was really worried! Coincidentally, at this time, the factory leaders transferred him to the technology section as a draftsman. He was overjoyed and determined to learn drafting in the technology section so as to realize his ideals. From then on, he used his evenings to study drafting diligently. It was not until March of this year that he produced the drawings. He didn't have time to manufacture the second one before the National Farm Implement Exhibition called for exhibits.

    张福来敢想敢为创造多
    张福来是安徽省合肥农具厂的描图员。他创造的净粮计算机和三轮车式木制脚踏水车、手摇吸筒水车、手摇木制解放水车，已经成了全国农具展览会的展品。
    1951年10月的一个夜晚，张福来出外检查粮仓（当时他在阜阳粮站工作），他们顶着风走，被风刮得直打趔趄。突然，他起了一个念头：“用风作动力不好吗？”这样，他在阜阳工作的几年中，利用无数个夜晚，经过反复研究设计出来的工具就有风力磨、三轮车式脚踏水车、游动式水打抽水机、红薯栽秧机和净粮计算机等。
    他研究这些东西的时候，曾经遇到过很多困难，有些人对他冷嘲他是“妄想”，太“自不量力”，就叫他“专家”，弄得他很难过！这时候是毛主席的“矛盾论”支持了他。“矛盾论”上那句“世界上没有绝对地平衡发展的东西”，给了他很大启示：对！人的想法也是这样的，有些人就敢往前想，有些人就不敢往前想。他把毛主席的这句话记在心里，作为冲击保守思想的武器！
    到1955年末，他研究创造的八种农具都大体上有了头绪，但是，因为县里缺乏经费却不能制造试验。他给中共安徽省委写信，并且寄去了各种工具的图样。党支持了他，省委书记曾希圣同志接见了他，并且把他调到合肥农具厂，责成厂里帮助他首先使用木料试制一架供试验用的净粮计算机。
    净粮计算机在1956年底造成了——就是在展览会展出的这一架。据试验是成功的，这架所有齿轮都是木制的机器，在计算粮食数量的时候，误差只有0.047％。鉴定时，几个部门的人又给他提了改进几个装置的意见，要再造一架进行试验。
    再造，问题就来了，改进几个装置要有图纸，但是，张福来还不会制图。在造第一架的时候，厂里一个有严重保守思想的工程技术人员，就用图纸难为过张福来，他不相信张的净粮计算机能够成功，但又不敢不造，于是就让不会制图的张福来交出施工图纸。再加厂里没有试制经费，因此，一直拖到1956年7月在党委检查督促下才不得不开工制造。这次让再造，他又拿出了老办法。张福来真是急坏了！恰巧，这时厂领导上调他到技术科当描图员，他高兴透了，决心要在技术科学会制图，好实现他的理想。从此，他就利用夜晚的时间刻苦的学习制图，直到今年3月才把图纸制出，还没来得及制造第二架，全国农具展览会就催要展品了。
