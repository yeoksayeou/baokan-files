Xinhua News Agency, 4th. The full text of the welcome speech by Chen Shutong, Vice Chairman of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace, at the Beijing Railway Station to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China, is as follows:

	Dear Head of Delegation Xu Zhenshu, dear comrades of the Korean People's Delegation to China:

	Today, we are very excited and happy to be able to meet with the Korean People's Delegation to China from our fraternal country. Please allow me, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people, to extend a warm welcome to all comrades of the delegation.

	The friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people have a long history. In the struggle against American imperialist aggression, our two peoples fought side by side and won a great victory. In recent years, the friendly, cooperative, and mutually supportive relationship between our two countries has developed substantially. We firmly believe that the visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China will further enhance the deep friendship that has long existed between our two peoples.

	Now, the Chinese and Korean people, as close as brothers, are making rapid progress in building socialism. This visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China comes at a time when the Chinese people, after achieving victory in the nationwide rectification campaign, are entering a new era of a nationwide leap forward in socialist construction. The arrival of the fraternal Korean People's Delegation will bring new encouragement to the Chinese people in their leap forward. Dear comrades, I wish you a complete success in your visit to our country!

	Long live the heroic Korean people!

	Long live the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Korean people!

	Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

	Long live world peace!

	Long live Premier Kim Il-sung!
