　　French Fascist Forces and Their Activities
    Recently, the rampant activities of French fascists and the armed rebellion in Algeria have posed a serious threat to France's republican system and the people's democratic freedoms.
    Fascist activities in France have a long history. As early as the beginning of the 20th century, France saw the emergence of fascist organizations. Fascist theorist Charles Maurras organized the "Action Française" movement in 1905. In 1924, under the leadership of Pierre Taittinger, the "Jeunesses Patriotes" was established. In 1927, the veterans' fascist organization "Croix-de-Feu" was formed under the leadership of Colonel de la Rocque. In 1933, the "Solidarité Française" was formed under the leadership of Jean Renaud. The "Action Française" and "Croix-de-Feu" were the most rampant, opposing the parliamentary republican system and the Communist Party internally, and advocating launching wars and expanding colonial influence externally. The "Croix-de-Feu" launched a fascist riot on February 6, 1934. But this riot was repelled. In 1936, the Popular Front government was established, and fascist organizations were dissolved for a time. During the occupation of France by Hitler's Germany, French fascist forces, led by Pétain, organized the traitorous government—the Vichy government. After the liberation of France, some leading fascists were executed, but the vast majority hid under the cover of the big bourgeoisie.
    The de Gaulle group, which was in power from 1944 to 1946, immediately became the center for the gathering of fascist forces. The establishment of de Gaulle's "Rassemblement du Peuple Français" in 1947 marked the resurgence of fascist forces. From 1947 to 1951, the fascists repeatedly attempted to seize power, but all failed. The "Rassemblement du Peuple Français" had to announce its dissolution, and in 1954, the de Gaulle faction established the "Social Republicans." At the same time, fascist forces and the Poujade movement combined to establish various fascist organizations, such as the "Jeune Nation" established in 1949, the "National Rally" and the "Parti Nationaliste Révolutionnaire" established in 1950, the "Front National des Combattants" established after the outbreak of the Algerian colonial war in 1954, the "Club Montagnard" established in 1956, and the "Restauration Nationale" established in March 1958. It is estimated that there are now as many as seventy fascist organizations in France.
    In recent years, French fascist forces have been demanding that de Gaulle form a government in the midst of cabinet crises, attempting to seize power. After the fall of the Gaillard government at the end of last September, fascists and some right-wing parties demanded the establishment of a "dictatorial government." In October, the "Social Republicans" publicly issued a statement "believing that the system should be thoroughly reformed to save the country." In November, the Poujade Congress also publicly demanded the dissolution of parliament and the rise of de Gaulle.
    With the independence of Tunisia and Morocco and the development of the Algerian national liberation war, French fascist forces are fanatically demanding the strengthening of military suppression and the use of force against Tunisia. This proposition of the fascist forces is supported by adventurers in the French army, especially middle and senior officers of the troops stationed in Algeria.
    While opposing the bourgeois republican system, fascist forces fiercely oppose the Communist Party and democratic progressive forces, constantly clamoring for the banning of the Communist Party, and have received the cooperation of right-wing bourgeois parties. For example, the Independent Republicans and the Independent Peasants Party successively submitted anti-communist bills to the parliament in January and February 1957 to dissolve and persecute the Communist Party.
    Therefore, the rampant activities of fascist forces this time are not accidental. However, the French working class and progressive forces, as well as all forces that support the republican system, have repeatedly thwarted the fascist forces' offensive. Now, they are fighting back against the new atrocities of the fascists.

　　法国法西斯势力及其活动
    最近，法国法西斯的猖狂活动和在阿尔及利亚的武装暴动，使法国的共和制度和人民的民主自由遭到了严重的威胁。
    法国的法西斯活动，由来已久。远在二十世纪初，法国就出现了法西斯性质的组织。法西斯理论家夏尔·莫拉，在1905年组织了“法兰西行动运动”。1924年又在皮埃尔·戴丁歇领导下成立了“青年爱国团”。1927年更有了拉罗克上校领导下成立的退伍军人法西斯组织“火十字团”。1933年戈蒂领导下成立了“法兰西团结运动”。“法兰西行动运动”和“火十字团”最为嚣张，对内反对议会共和制度，反对共产党，对外主张发动战争，扩张殖民势力。“火十字团”曾在1934年2月6日发动过一次法西斯暴动。但这次暴动被击退了。1936年成立人民阵线政府，法西斯组织一度被解散。在希特勒德国占领法国期间，法国法西斯势力以贝当为首组织了卖国政府——维希政府。法国解放后，一些法西斯首犯被处死刑，但极大部分则在大资产阶级的掩护下隐藏起来。
    在1944—1946年执政的戴高乐集团，立即成为法西斯势力集结的中心。1947年戴高乐的“法兰西人民联盟”的成立，标志着法西斯势力的重新抬头。从1947年到1951年时期内，法西斯一再企图夺取政权，但都遭到失败。“法兰西人民联盟”不得不宣告瓦解，直至1954年戴高乐派又成立了“社会共和党”。与此同时，法西斯势力和布热德运动结合在一起，先后成立了各种法西斯组织，如1949年成立的“青年国家运动”，1950年成立的“国民联盟”和“革命爱国党”，1954年阿尔及利亚殖民战争爆发后成立的“全国战士阵线”，1956年成立的“山岳党俱乐部”以及1958年3月成立的“法国保皇大会”。据估计，法国现有法西斯组织，已达七十个之多。
    几年来，法国法西斯势力一直在内阁危机中要求由戴高乐出组政府，企图夺取政权。去年9月底，布歇—莫努里内阁倒台后，法西斯分子和一些右翼政党就要求建立“独裁政府”。10月，“社会共和党”公开发表声明，“认为应该彻底改革制度以拯救国家”。11月，布热德代表大会也公开要求解散议会，由戴高乐上台。
    随着突尼斯、摩洛哥的独立，阿尔及利亚民族解放战争的发展，法国法西斯势力狂热要求加强武力镇压，并要以武力对付突尼斯。法西斯势力的这个主张，得到法国军队中的冒险分子、特别是驻阿尔及利亚部队的中高级军官的支持。
    法西斯势力在反对资产阶级共和制度时，凶恶地反对共产党和民主进步力量，一直叫嚣取缔共产党，并得到了资产阶级右翼政党的配合。如独立共和党、独立农民党曾先后在1957年1月和2月向议会提出过解散和迫害共产党的反共法案。
    因此，这次法西斯势力的猖狂活动，并不是偶然的。但是，法国工人阶级和进步力量，以及一切拥护共和政体的力量，曾经一再挫败了法西斯势力的进攻。现在，他们正在对法西斯的新暴行进行反击。
