To address the learning difficulties of worker-peasant-cadre students, the Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications has formulated specific measures to strengthen tutoring for these students.

Their measures include: assigning lecturers or teachers with good teaching results to be responsible for tutoring worker-peasant-cadre students. They also use methods such as group discussions to answer questions for these students. Their handling of promotion, retention, and grade-level repetition for worker-peasant-cadre students who have learning difficulties, students from accelerated middle schools, and students transferring from special classes for veteran cadres to regular classes, is strictly based on the spirit of the promotion and retention regulations issued by the original Ministry of Higher Education, and is applied flexibly in combination with the specific circumstances of the institute, with appropriate discretion. Worker-peasant-cadre students, especially those who have greater difficulties in learning foreign languages, may be exempted from studying foreign languages upon application, provided that it does not affect the study of other courses.

    他们的办法是：指定主讲教师或教学效果良好的教师负责辅导工农调干学生。并用集体讨论等方法对工农调干学生进行答疑。他们对学习上有困难的工农调干学生、速成中学来的学生以及由老干部特别班转入正班学习的学生的升、留级的处理，是严格根据原高教部颁发的升、留级规定精神并结合该院具体情况灵活运用，适当掌握。工农调干学生，特别是学习外国语困难较大的学生，在不影响学习其他课程的原则下，经过申请，可以免学外文。　（松浩）
