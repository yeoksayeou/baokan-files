Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 2nd dispatch: The French colonial army announced today that French troops and the Algerian National Liberation Army have been fighting near Souk Ahras in eastern Algeria for the past four days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented in the three and a half years since the outbreak of the Algerian War.

According to Western news agencies, in this battle, more than 400 soldiers of the Algerian National Liberation Army fought bravely against 3,000 French colonial paratroopers and infantry, supported by aircraft, damaging two French aircraft and one helicopter, and inflicting 40 to 50 casualties on the French army.

In the Boghni area south of Algiers and in the Kabylie mountains east of Algiers, fierce clashes also occurred between the two sides.

In Ain Sefra, south of Oran, the Algerian National Liberation Army raided the French engineering unit's barracks on the night of April 28 and broke into the town. The French side announced that the attack resulted in nine French casualties. Near Laverdure, east of Constantine, fierce fighting also broke out between the two sides on the 27th.

According to French military authorities, 300 to 400 so-called Algerian "auxiliaries" who were helping the French army fight and "maintain order" revolted on the 28th and defected to the National Liberation Army. They killed the commander who commanded 500 "auxiliaries" guarding the Algiers-Oran railway and kidnapped the officers in the "auxiliary" unit.

The Algerian people also widely launched guerrilla activities, using landmines to destroy the train from Constantine to Biskra, and executing and capturing three national traitors near Oran.
