    Modern Revisionism Must Be Criticized
    Today is the 140th anniversary of the birth of Karl Marx, the founder of scientific communism. Since 1844, Marxism has been fighting against all kinds of reactionary ideas of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and against all kinds of opportunist ideas in the international workers' movement. Marxism has continuously won victories in the struggle because revolutionary practice has proved its correctness. In the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, Lenin developed Marxism in struggle and pushed it to a new stage, the stage of Leninism. Now the international workers' movement has put forward a new sacred task for Marxism-Leninism, which is to conduct an irreconcilable struggle against modern revisionism, or new Bernsteinism. This is a struggle between two fundamentally different lines, Marxism-Leninism and anti-Marxism-Leninism, a great struggle concerning the success or failure of the international working class cause and the socialist cause.
    The recently concluded Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia adopted the "Draft Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia," which is an anti-Marxist-Leninist and thoroughly revisionist program. To sum up, this draft program uses sophistry to replace revolutionary materialist dialectics in terms of ideological methodology; in politics, it uses reactionary supra-class state theory to replace the Marxist-Leninist state theory, and reactionary bourgeois nationalism to replace revolutionary proletarian internationalism; in political economy, it defends monopoly capital and confuses the fundamental differences between capitalism and socialism. This draft program openly abandons the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism, opposes last November's declaration of the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries in Moscow, and also violates the "Peace Manifesto" of the meeting of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, which the representatives of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia themselves had agreed to. This draft program calls all the basic principles of the revolutionary theory laid down by Marx and Engels and developed by Lenin and other great Marxists "dogmatism," while the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia call themselves "irreconcilable enemies of dogmatism."
    What is the most fundamental "dogmatism" that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia want to attack? It is proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. However, as everyone knows, there can be no socialism without proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia focuses on opposing proletarian revolution, attacking proletarian dictatorship, vilifying socialist countries and the socialist camp, and beautifying capitalist and imperialist countries and the imperialist camp. This cannot but make people doubt the "socialism" mentioned by the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.
    Like the tone of reactionaries of all countries and the bourgeois rightists in China, the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia viciously slanders the dictatorship of the proletariat, saying that it "creates bureaucracy, state totalitarianism, political leadership divorced from the working masses, stagnation, the malformation of socialist development, and the sharpening of internal contradictions and antagonisms." They viciously slander the socialist camp, saying that it also has so-called "policies of hegemonic struggle from a position of strength." They describe the socialist camp and the imperialist camp, two fundamentally different world political and economic systems, as "the world is divided into two opposing military and political blocs." They portray themselves as being outside the socialist and imperialist "two blocs," that is, in a so-called supra-bloc position; they believe that the United Nations manipulated by the United States can "make the world increasingly unified"; international economic cooperation among all countries, including imperialism, is "an integral part of the socialist road to world economic development." They believe that "the vigorously developing state capitalist trend in the capitalist world clearly proves that mankind is irresistibly and deeply entering the socialist era through various channels." These arguments cannot but remind people of the revisionist preachings of the right-wing social democrats of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Bernstein, Kautsky, and Hilferding, such as so-called "evolutionary socialism," "ultra-imperialism," "organized capitalism," and "capitalism peacefully growing into socialism." The purpose of this revisionist preaching is to induce the working class in capitalist countries to abandon the revolutionary struggle for socialism and to maintain the rule of the bourgeoisie. Now the preaching of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia also has a kind of arrogant attempt towards the working class and other working people of various countries, that is, to induce workers and other workers to embark on the road of surrendering to capitalism. In November 1956, Tito, the leader of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, said in his speech in Pula: "The actual issue involved is: whether the new policy will prevail in the Communist Parties of various countries - this policy actually started in Yugoslavia." "The question now is: whether this line (note: this is the so-called Yugoslav line) will prevail, or the Stalin line will prevail again. Yugoslavia cannot only take care of itself, it must work hard in all aspects." These words fully expose what their ambitions are.
    The emergence of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia at the present time is by no means accidental. Since the great October Socialist Revolution, the international communist movement has achieved a series of great historical victories, the socialist system has won victories among more than 900 million people, the general crisis of capitalism has greatly expanded, and the imperialist countries headed by the United States are experiencing a new profound periodic economic crisis. Therefore, the imperialists headed by the United States are stepping up their sabotage of the international communist movement. The means by which the bourgeoisie has always undermined the workers' movement are nothing more than two kinds, one is the means of violent suppression, and the other is the means of deception. Under the current new international situation, when the paralyzing effect of the revisionism of the right-wing social democrats on the working class and the working masses is weakening, the program put forward by the Yugoslav revisionists precisely meets the needs of the imperialists, especially the U.S. imperialists.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Revisionism, or right-leaning opportunism, is a bourgeois trend of thought, which is more dangerous than dogmatism. Revisionists and right-leaning opportunists also hang Marxism on their lips, and they are also attacking 'dogmatism' there. But what they are attacking is precisely the most fundamental things of Marxism." Now the facts have proved that this passage of Comrade Mao Zedong's is not only aimed at our country's situation, but also applies to the international situation.
    The declaration of the meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries wrote: "Under the present conditions, the main danger is revisionism, or right-leaning opportunism. It is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology, it paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class, and demands the preservation or restoration of capitalism." The declaration also particularly emphasized: "Modern revisionism attempts to slander the great doctrine of Marxism-Leninism, saying that it is 'outdated' and seems to have lost its significance for social development. Revisionists try to corrupt the revolutionary soul of Marxism and undermine the confidence of the working class and the working people in socialism. They deny the historical necessity of proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism, deny the leading role of Marxist-Leninist parties, deny the principle of proletarian internationalism, and demand the abandonment of the basic principles of Leninism on party building, especially the abandonment democratic centralism, demanding to transform the Communist Party from a fighting revolutionary organization into some kind of club for endless disputes." The declaration clearly depicts the face of modern revisionists, and the content of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia precisely expresses such a face.
    It is very obvious that a series of anti-Marxist-Leninist and thoroughly revisionist views concentrated in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia must be publicly and irreconcilably criticized. If it was inevitable for Marxists to launch a theoretical criticism of the revisionism of Bernstein and Kautsky at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century, then our criticism of new Bernsteinism is even more necessary now. Because modern revisionism is put forward by the leading group of a party that holds state power, as a complete and systematic program, because the purpose of modern revisionism is to split the international communist movement, to undermine the unity of socialist countries, and directly harm the fundamental interests of the Yugoslav people.
    We believe that the criticism in the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties' June 1948 "Resolution on the Situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia" regarding the Communist Party of Yugoslavia's departure from Marxist-Leninist principles and its slide into the mistake of bourgeois nationalism was basically correct; however, the Information Bureau's handling of this issue at the time had shortcomings and errors in its methods. The resolution on Yugoslavia adopted by the Information Bureau in November 1949 was wrong, and the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries participating in the Information Bureau meeting later revoked this resolution. Since 1954, the Soviet Union and various countries of the socialist camp have taken various measures with utmost benevolence and righteousness to improve relations with Yugoslavia, which is completely correct and necessary. The Communist Parties of various countries have adopted a patient attitude, hoping that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia will return to the Marxist-Leninist position, so as to help the Yugoslav people adhere to the socialist road. However, the leading group of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia rejected the good intentions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communists of various countries. Around the Hungarian incident, they once attempted to use so-called "anti-Stalinism" to split the unity of socialist countries, supported the traitor Nagy group in the Hungarian incident, and in their recent congress, they put forward a systematic and complete revisionist program. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia should calmly think about it, can the League of Communists of Yugoslavia maintain unity with the Communist Parties of various countries by abandoning the basic viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism and adhering to revisionist viewpoints? Can there be a basis for unity without the common viewpoints of Marxism-Leninism? Is it beneficial to the Yugoslav people to refuse to be friendly with the socialist camp countries and refuse to be friendly with the Communist Parties of various countries?
    We believe that in the international workers' movement, it is completely necessary to distinguish between right and wrong. As Lenin said, "A principled policy is the only correct policy." The current world is at a new historical turning point where the East wind prevails over the West wind. The struggle between the Marxist line and the revisionist line is nothing but a reflection of the intensified struggle between the emerging social class forces and the dying social class forces, and a reflection of the intensified struggle between the imperialist world and the socialist world. It is impossible for every Marxist-Leninist to avoid this struggle. The development of history will increasingly clearly prove how significant this struggle is for the international communist movement!

    现代修正主义必须批判
    今天是科学共产主义创始人——马克思诞辰的一百四十周年。从1844年以来，马克思主义一直是在同资产阶级、小资产阶级各式各样的反动思潮作斗争，同国际工人运动中的各式各样的机会主义思想作斗争。马克思主义在斗争中不断地获得了胜利，因为革命的实践证明了它的正确。在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代，列宁就是在斗争中发展了马克思主义，把马克思主义推上了一个新的阶段，即列宁主义的阶段。现在国际工人运动又向马克思列宁主义提出了一个新的神圣任务，就是要同现代修正主义，或者说新的伯恩斯坦主义，进行毫不调和的斗争。这是马克思列宁主义和反马克思列宁主义的两条根本不同路线的斗争，这是关系国际工人阶级事业和社会主义事业成败的一场大斗争。
    最近结束的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会，通过了“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案”，这是一个反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领。概括地说来，这个纲领草案在思想方法上是用诡辩代替革命的唯物辩证法；在政治上是用反动的超阶级的国家论代替马克思列宁主义的国家论，用反动的资产阶级民族主义代替革命的无产阶级国际主义；在政治经济学上是为垄断资本辩护，混淆资本主义和社会主义两种制度的根本区别。这个纲领草案公然背弃了马克思列宁主义的根本原则，与去年11月在莫斯科召开的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言相对抗，同时也违反了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表自己所曾经表示同意的六十四个共产党和工人党代表会议的“和平宣言”。这个纲领草案把马克思和恩格斯所奠定的、经过列宁和其他伟大的马克思主义者加以发展的革命理论的基本原则，一概叫做“教条主义”，而南共领导人自称为“教条主义的不调和的敌人”。
    南共领导人所要攻击的“教条主义”，最根本的是什么呢？就是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。但是，大家知道，没有无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，就不可能有什么社会主义。南共纲领草案集中地反对无产阶级革命，攻击无产阶级专政，对社会主义国家和社会主义阵营加以丑化，对资本主义、帝国主义国家和帝国主义阵营则加以美化。这就不能不使人们对于南共领导人所说的“社会主义”发生了怀疑。
    像各国反动派和中国资产阶级右派的口吻一样，南共领导集团恶毒地诬蔑无产阶级专政，说它“造成官僚主义、国家极权主义思想、政治领导力量脱离劳动群众、停滞、社会主义发展畸形化以及内部矛盾和对立的尖锐化”。他们恶毒地诬蔑社会主义阵营，说它也有所谓“从实力地位出发采取霸权斗争的政策”。他们把社会主义阵营和帝国主义阵营这两种根本不同的世界政治经济体系，说成是“世界分裂为两个敌对的军事政治集团”。他们描写自己是置身在社会主义和帝国主义“两个集团”之外，即处于所谓超集团的地位；他们认为美国操纵的联合国可以“使世界日趋统一”；世界各国，即包括帝国主义在内的国际经济合作，是“走向世界经济发展的社会主义道路的组成部分”。他们认为，“资本主义世界蓬勃发展的国家资本主义趋势极其明显地证明：人类正在通过各种途径不可阻挡地深深地进入社会主义时代”。这些论点使人们不能不想起十九世纪末期和二十世纪初期的右翼社会党徒，如伯恩斯坦、考茨基、希佛亭之流的所谓“进化的社会主义”、“超帝国主义”、“有组织的资本主义”、“资本主义和平长入社会主义”等等修正主义的说教。这种修正主义说教的目的，就是要引诱资本主义各国的工人阶级放弃争取社会主义的革命斗争，而维护资产阶级的统治。现在南共领导人的说教，对于各国工人阶级和其他劳动人民，也抱有一种狂妄的企图，就是想引诱工人和其他劳动者走上向资本主义投降的道路。1956年11月间，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导人铁托在普拉的演说中曾经说过：“实际牵涉到的问题是：新的方针是否会在各国共产党内得胜——这种方针实际上是在南斯拉夫开始的。”“现在的问题是：是这条路线（按：这就是所谓南斯拉夫路线）得胜呢，还是斯大林路线再度得胜。南斯拉夫不能只管自己，它必须在各方面努力。”这些话充分暴露了他们的野心究竟是什么。
    南共纲领草案出现在目前时期，决不是偶然的。从伟大的十月社会主义革命以来，国际共产主义运动已经取得了一系列的伟大的历史性的胜利，社会主义制度已经在九亿多人口中取得了胜利，资本主义总危机大大地扩大了，以美国为首的帝国主义国家正在经历一个新的深刻的周期性经济危机。因此，以美国为首的帝国主义者对于国际共产主义运动正在加紧进行破坏。资产阶级历来破坏工人运动的手段不外两种，一种是暴力镇压的手段，一种是欺骗的手段。在目前国际新形势下面，在右翼社会党的修正主义在工人阶级和劳动群众中的麻痹作用日益减弱的时候，南斯拉夫修正主义者所提出的纲领，恰恰是符合帝国主义者——特别是美帝国主义者的需要。
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”中说：“修正主义，或者右倾机会主义，是一种资产阶级思潮，它比教条主义有更大的危险性。修正主义者，右倾机会主义者，口头上也挂着马克思主义，他们也在那里攻击‘教条主义’。但是他们所攻击的正是马克思主义的最根本的东西。”现在事实已经证明，毛泽东同志说的这一段话不但针对着我国的情况，并且也适合于国际的情况。
    社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言写道：“在目前条件下，主要的危险是修正主义，或者说右倾机会主义。它是资产阶级意识形态的表现，它麻痹工人阶级的革命意志，要求保存或者恢复资本主义。”宣言还特别着重地指出：“现代修正主义企图诽谤马克思列宁主义的伟大学说，说它是‘过了时的’，似乎目前对于社会发展已经丧失了意义。修正主义者力图腐蚀马克思主义的革命灵魂，破坏工人阶级和劳动人民对于社会主义的信心。他们否认在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期实行无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的历史必要性，否认马克思列宁主义政党的领导作用，否认无产阶级国际主义原则，要求放弃列宁主义关于党的建设的基本原则，首先是放弃民主集中制，要求把共产党从一个战斗的革命组织变成某种争论不休的俱乐部。”宣言很清楚地描绘了现代修正主义者的嘴脸，南共纲领草案的内容正是表现了这样的一副嘴脸。
    非常明显，对于南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案所集中起来的一系列反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的观点，必须进行公开的毫不调和的批判。如果说，上一世纪末期和本世纪初期马克思主义者对伯恩斯坦和考茨基之流的修正主义展开理论批判是不可避免的话，那末，现在我们对于新伯恩斯坦主义的批判更加是必要的了。因为现代修正主义是由一个掌握国家政权的党的领导集团，作为一个完整的系统的纲领而提出的，因为现代修正主义的目的是在于分裂国际共产主义运动，在于破坏社会主义国家的团结，而且直接损害了南斯拉夫人民的根本利益。
    我们认为，1948年6月共产党情报局“关于南斯拉夫共产党状况的决议”中，对于南斯拉夫共产党脱离了马克思列宁主义原则而陷入资产阶级民族主义的错误所进行的批评，基本上是正确的；但是当时情报局对于这个问题的处理，在方法上是有缺点和错误的。1949年11月情报局通过的关于南斯拉夫的决议则是错误的，参加情报局会议的各国共产党和工人党后来已经撤消了这个决议。从1954年以来，苏联和社会主义阵营各国仁至义尽地采取各种措施，以改善同南斯拉夫的关系，这是完全正确的，必要的。各国共产党采取耐心等待的态度，希望南共领导人回到马克思列宁主义的立场上来，以利于南斯拉夫人民坚持社会主义的道路。但是，南共领导集团拒绝了苏共中央和各国共产党人的善意的努力。在匈牙利事变前后，他们曾经企图用所谓“反斯大林主义”来分裂社会主义阵营各国的团结，在匈牙利事变中，支持叛徒纳吉集团，而在他们最近召开的代表大会中，更提出了系统的完整的修正主义纲领。南共领导人应该冷静地想一想，难道南共放弃马克思列宁主义的基本观点，而坚持修正主义的观点，能够保持同各国共产党的团结吗？难道没有马克思列宁主义的共同观点，能够有团结的基础吗？难道拒绝同社会主义阵营各国友好，拒绝同各国共产党友好，对南斯拉夫人民是有利的吗？
    我们认为，在国际工人运动中，分清大是大非，是完全必要的。正如列宁所说，“原则性的政策是唯一正确的政策”。目前世界是处在东风压倒西风的新的历史转折点。马克思主义路线和修正主义路线的斗争，不是别的，而是反映了新兴的社会阶级力量同垂死的社会阶级力量的尖锐化的斗争，反映了帝国主义世界同社会主义世界的尖锐化的斗争。每一个马克思列宁主义者要想躲避这个斗争是不可能的。历史的发展将会越来越清楚地证明，这个斗争对于国际共产主义运动是具有多么重大的意义！
