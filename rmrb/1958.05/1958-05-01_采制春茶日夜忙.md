    Busy Day and Night Harvesting and Processing Spring Tea
    (Reported by this newspaper) The spring tea harvest has reached its peak season, and tea farmers everywhere are working day and night to harvest and process spring tea.
    It is understood that the spring tea production in Zhejiang, Hunan, Anhui and other provinces may increase by 20% to 30% this year. The quality of tea has significantly improved, and the newly launched Longjing, Biluochun, Qihong, and Minhong teas are almost all first-grade teas.
    This year's tea garden cultivation, fertilization, soil filling, and frost prevention work have been carried out more thoroughly and universally than in any previous year. Due to better tea garden management, coupled with this spring's harmonious and early warming climate in the tea area, tea buds have sprouted quickly and abundantly, and the branches and leaves are lush green. The spring tea picking season generally started about ten days earlier than last year.
    All localities not only attach importance to the increase in tea production, but also actively pay attention to the improvement of quality.

    采制春茶日夜忙
    本报讯　采摘春茶已到旺季，各地茶农正夜以继日地采制春茶。
    据了解，浙江、湖南、安徽等省今年春茶可增产20％—30％。茶叶品质显著提高，初上市的龙井、碧螺春、祁红、闽红等几乎都是一级茶。
    今年的茶园中耕、施肥、坑土、防冻等工作，比以往任何一年都做得深入普遍。由于茶园管理较好，再加上今春茶区气候调和早暖，因此茶芽发的快发的多，枝叶葱绿。春茶开采时期一般比去年提早十天左右。
    各地不仅重视茶叶产量的增加，同时还积极注意品质的提高。
