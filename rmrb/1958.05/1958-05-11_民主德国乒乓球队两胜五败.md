　　East German Table Tennis Team Wins Two, Loses Five

　　(Our report) Last night, the visiting East German table tennis team played a wonderful friendly match with the Beijing team at the Beijing Gymnasium. In the seven matches of men's and women's singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles, the East German team won two games, and the Beijing team won five.

　　The East German team included male players Schneider, Prosche, and Haupt, and female players Rudel, Gonschorek, and Mittlstedt; the Beijing team included Jiang Yongning, Fu Qifang, Hu Bingquan, Ye Peiqiong, and Zhang Baodi.

　　In last night's match, the game between Schneider and Hu Bingquan was intense and exciting. Schneider was the third-place winner in the men's singles at the 1957 World Table Tennis Championships, capable of both attack and defense. Hu Bingquan is also a fierce attacker, having defeated the European champion Berczik. The two played evenly matched. Hu Bingquan lost to Schneider by a score of two to three due to a lack of composure.

　　The results of the other two men's singles matches were Fu Qifang winning against Haupt three to zero, and Jiang Yongning winning against Prosche three to one. In the two women's singles matches, Ye Peiqiong and Zhang Baodi respectively won against Rudel and Gonschorek by scores of three to zero and three to one.

　　In the men's doubles match, Fu Qifang and Hu Bingquan did not coordinate well, and Hu Bingquan's smashes went out of bounds many times. The guest team, Schneider and Prosche, won three games. In the mixed doubles, Jiang Yongning and Ye Peiqiong, known for their defensive skills, won against Schneider and Mittlstedt by a score of three to one.
