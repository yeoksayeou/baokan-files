The irrigated area accounts for more than half of the total cultivated land.
The average irrigated land owned by each farmer is more than double what it was before liberation.
This paper reports that the rural areas have achieved great success in farmland capital construction centered on water conservancy during the past winter and this spring, and the national irrigated area has reached more than 860 million mu. With the unfolding of spring planting, activities of farmland water conservancy and other farmland capital construction have turned to be regular.

The scale, manpower, material resources, financial resources, progress and achievements of the high tide of farmland capital construction centered on water conservancy in the past six months from last winter to this spring are all unprecedented. According to incomplete statistics in mid-April: the total amount of completed projects in rural areas throughout the country for water conservancy, soil and water conservation, and low-lying area management reached more than 25 billion cubic meters of earth and stone. If these earth and stones were paved into a road one meter thick and sixty-six meters wide, it could be paved from the earth to the moon. During this period, farmers across the country worked a total of more than 13 billion workdays. Calculated with 100 million laborers, each laborer worked more than 130 workdays. This is in fact a total mobilization of 500 million farmers.

In the past six months, the achievements of the completed farmland water conservancy projects, soil and water conservation projects and low-lying area management projects have been enormous. In terms of farmland water conservancy, as of the end of April, the newly increased irrigated area reached 353.334 million mu, which is 29.3% more than the 273.221 million mu of newly increased irrigated area in the eight years since liberation, and 47.9% more than the original irrigated area of 238.893 million mu before liberation. This has made the national irrigated area (including paddy fields and irrigated land) leap from more than 500 million mu before October 1957 to 865.488 million mu, reaching more than 50% of the total cultivated land area, exceeding India and the United States; so that 500 million farmers have more than 1.7 mu of irrigable cultivated land per person; which is more than doubled compared to the average irrigable cultivated land owned by each person before liberation. In the past six months, the newly increased controllable area of soil and water conservation has reached more than 159,000 square kilometers. The management of low-lying areas has reached 203.225 million mu.

The national irrigation equipment has also been greatly developed. At the end of 1957, there were 1.76 million canal projects in the country, of which more than 1,800 irrigated more than 10,000 mu; 8.31 million various ponds and dams (including small reservoirs) water storage projects, and 7.74 million wells. With the new projects built this spring in Henan, northern Anhui and Hebei, the numbers are even greater.

During these six months, many canals have been excavated on the plains of Henan and northern Anhui. The total length far exceeds the north-south Grand Canal built in the past.

After half a year of farmland capital construction, many changes have taken place in the plains and mountainous areas of our country. The most significant are the Henan Plain, the Huaibei Plain in Anhui Province, and the North China Plain, the western mountainous areas of Henan, and the central mountainous areas of Gansu. The drought-prone and flood-prone Henan and Huaibei Plains, paddy fields and irrigated areas have developed the most, and the low-lying areas that accumulated water in previous years will become rice areas of fish and rice this year. The farmland water conservancy construction in the past six months has greatly improved the ability of these areas to prevent water and drought disasters, providing a reliable guarantee for agricultural production increase. This year, due to the expansion of spring irrigation area, the threat of spring drought to spring planting in Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Guangxi and other provinces can be greatly reduced.

Of the 350 million mu of newly increased irrigated area in the past six months, 133.83 million mu can currently exert benefits. In the water conservancy projects that are still under construction, various places are strengthening the leadership of water storage and irrigation management, so that more newly built projects can quickly exert benefits.

### 灌溉面积已占总耕地一半多  每个农民平均占有可浇灌耕地比解放前增加两倍以上

    灌溉面积已占总耕地一半多
    每个农民平均占有可浇灌耕地比解放前增加两倍以上
    本报讯　去冬今春农村以兴修水利为中心的农田基本建设取得巨大的成绩，全国灌溉面积已达八亿六千多万亩。随着春播的展开，兴修农田水利和其他农田基本建设的活动已转入经常化。
    去冬今春前后半年左右，以水利为中心的农田基本建设高潮的规模，投入的人力、物力和财力，进度和成就都是史无前例的。据4月中旬的不完全统计：全国农村兴修水利、水土保持和洼地治理三项完成的工程总量，共达土石方二百五十多亿公方。这些土石方如果铺成一公尺厚六十六公尺宽的路，可以从地球铺到月球。在此期间，全国农民共作了一百三十多亿个工日。以一亿劳动力计，每个劳动力就做了一百三十多个工日。这事实上是五亿农民的总动员。
    半年来，修成的农田水利工程、水土保持工程和洼地治理工程，成绩都是巨大的。农田水利方面截至4月底止，新增灌溉面积达三亿五千三百三十四万亩。比解放以来八年间新增的灌溉面积二亿七千三百二十一万亩还多29.3％，比解放以前原有的灌溉面积二亿三千八百九十三万亩还多47.9％。这就使全国灌溉面积（包括水田和水浇地）从1957年10月前的五亿多亩一跃而达八亿六千五百四十八万亩，达到耕地总面积的50％以上，超过了印度和美国；使五亿农民每人有一点七亩多可浇灌的耕地；比解放前每人平均占有的可浇灌的耕地增加了两倍多。半年来水土保持方面，新增可控制的面积达十五万九千多平方公里。洼地治理达二亿零三百二十五万亩。
    全国灌溉工程设备也有了很大的发展。1957年底全国共有渠道工程一百七十六万处，其中灌田万亩以上的有一千八百多处；各种塘坝（包括小水库）蓄水工程八百三十一万处，水井七百七十四万眼。加上今春河南、皖北和河北等地新修的工程，数字更大。
    这半年中间，在河南和皖北的平原上，开挖了很多运河。总长度远远超过了过去所兴修的南北大运河。
    经过半年来的农田基本建设，我国平原和山区都发生了很多变化。最显著的是河南平原、安徽省淮北平原和华北平原，豫西部分山区和甘肃中部的山区，易旱易涝的河南和淮北平原，水田和灌溉面积发展最大，往年积水的涝区洼地今年将变成水稻区的鱼米之乡。半年来的农田水利建设大大提高了这些地区防止水旱灾害的能力，为农业增产提供了可靠的保证。今年由于春灌面积扩大，河北、山西、甘肃、贵州、广西等省春旱对春播的威胁可以大为减轻。
    半年来新增的灌溉面积三亿五千多万亩中，当前能发挥效益的为一亿三千三百八十三万亩。在继续兴修中的水利工程，各地正加强对蓄水保水和灌溉管理的领导，使更多的新修工程迅速发挥效益。（附图表）
