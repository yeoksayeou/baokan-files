Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 29th: The Military Academy of the Chinese People's Liberation Army is extensively carrying out activities to study Chairman Mao's military works.

On May 26th, the Military Academy held an academic report meeting to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao's article "On Protracted War." Zhang Zhen, Vice President of the Military Academy, delivered a report at the commemoration meeting. He emphasized that it is necessary to strive to study Chairman Mao's military works; to learn from Chairman Mao's brilliant example of combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution; to learn from Chairman Mao's noble style of daring to break, daring to establish, daring to think, and daring to speak; to learn from Chairman Mao's mass line in military work, and so on.

The Military Academy has attached great importance to the study of Chairman Mao's military thought in its regular training work. Chairman Mao's military works, such as "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War" and "On Protracted War," have been included in the regular curriculum for focused study. In order to improve the ideological level of the teaching staff and officers on active duty, the Military Academy, in addition to organizing the study of Chairman Mao's philosophical works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," has also specifically established training courses to rotate teachers and officers above the rank of regimental commander on active duty, organizing them to carefully study Chairman Mao's military works. At the same time, guided by Chairman Mao's military thought, the Military Academy, based on the glorious traditions and combat experience of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the actual situation, and absorbing the advanced experience of the Soviet army and modern military science and technology, has compiled new teaching materials suitable for the actual needs of army building. Many teachers and students who have studied Chairman Mao's works have reflected: As long as we strive to master Chairman Mao's military theory, this ideological weapon, we will surely be able to control modern military science and technology and defeat any powerful enemy.
