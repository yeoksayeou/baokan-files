　　Guangxi Sends 5,000 Cadres to Strengthen the Industrial Front
    Anhui County Leaders Visit Factories
    Nanning, May 13 (Reporter Huang Yijie) – The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Party Committee recently transferred more than 5,000 cadres to the industrial front to strengthen leadership in industrial construction and replenish technical forces. Currently, these cadres are being assembled in succession, and some have already taken up new work positions.

    This group of cadres was selected from various directly affiliated organs of the autonomous region, special districts (cities), counties, cadres who had been sent to lower levels, and old factories and mines. They all have certain work experience and relatively good political qualifications, with approximately 40% or more being members of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist Youth League. Moreover, the majority have at least a junior high school education. Among them, nine bureau-level cadres were transferred to medium-sized newly built factories and mines and units such as the Liuzhou Fertilizer Plant, Liuzhou Power Station, Guilin Paper Mill, Zhaoping Hydropower Station, and Hydropower Engineering Bureau, to serve as Party committee secretaries and administrative leaders. More than 200 county and section-level cadres will serve as leaders in the offices and workshops of various newly built factories and mines. After training, the remaining cadres will mostly become technical workers.

    In order to train this group of cadres to become both red and expert industrial cadres, the main methods currently adopted are old factories contracting for new factories, master craftsmen mentoring apprentices, and on-site visits and learning. For example, the large number of cadres and technical forces needed by the sugar industry are mainly being trained by old sugar factories such as Guixian, Lingli, and Mingyang in this region. The technical forces in other areas, such as steel plants, fertilizer plants, cement plants, oil plants, and hydropower stations, are being sent to Liaoning, Jilin, Jiangsu, Guangdong, Beijing, Chongqing, and other provinces (cities) for training.

    Hefei, May 13 (Reporter Yu Feng) – In the great development of local industry in Anhui Province, in order to enable leading cadres in various counties to better understand industry and lead industry, the province recently organized more than 60 county-level industrial ministers of the Chinese Communist Party to visit factories and learn. This measure has achieved very good results.

    The cadres who went to various places to visit have visited 23 large, medium, and small-sized factories and mines of various types in the cities of Bengbu, Huainan, and Hefei. During the visits, a method combining visits and lectures was adopted, with factory directors and engineers giving lectures, answering questions, and finally discussing, achieving the requirement of being able to generally grasp the basic knowledge of running industry.

    After nearly a month of visits and study, the enthusiasm of various counties for running industry has become even higher. Everyone agreed that the method of visiting and learning is very good, takes a short time, and yields quick results, with greater effectiveness than studying in training classes. Before the study, some counties planning to build factories did not know what equipment was needed. For example, He County wanted to build a paper mill and a knitting factory, and Chu County wanted to build a cement plant, a glass factory, and a sawmill. Although they had raw materials, they did not know what equipment was needed and had not been able to build them. After the visits and study, the cadres in these two counties now have a clear idea and greater confidence. Factories that could not be built in the past can now be built.

    During their visits and study, they further clarified the direction and scale of running local industry. Before the study, some people believed that "running industry means mechanization, which requires a large amount of investment." One county planned to build a glass factory and thought that an investment of 150,000 yuan was not enough. When they visited the Hefei Glass Factory and saw that this factory had only invested 50,000 yuan and could not only produce daily necessities but also medical supplies, they realized the correct path for developing local industry. Some counties believed that factories for manufacturing refractory bricks and cement were beyond the capabilities of the county, so they dared not build factories even though they had raw materials. After the visit, they linked it to the actual situation in their county, revised the original plan, and proposed new factory construction projects. And seeing that factories producing low-grade cement, rayon, miscellaneous wool processing, ceramics, and refractory bricks have the characteristics of low investment, not much equipment, simple operation, and good sales, each county has set up factories according to its own characteristics.

　　广西五千干部增强工业战线
    安徽各县领导干部参观工厂
    本报南宁13日电　记者黄义杰报道：中共广西僮族自治区委员会最近抽调了五千多名干部转向工业战线，以加强工业建设的领导和充实技术力量。目前，这批干部正陆续集中，一部分已经走上了新工作岗位。
    这批干部是从自治区、专（市）、县的各级直属机关和下放干部及老厂矿中选调上来的。他们都有一定的工作经验，政治条件比较好，约有40％以上是中共党员和共青团员。而且大部分都具有初中以上的文化程度。其中有九个厅、局长级干部，是调到柳州化肥厂、柳州电站、桂林造纸厂、昭平水电站和水电工程局等中型的新建厂矿和单位，担任党委书记和行政领导干部；二百多名县、科级干部将担任各新建厂矿的科室和车间的领导职务。其余干部经过培训以后，大部将成为技术工人。
    为了把这批干部培养成又红又专的工业干部，目前，主要采取老厂包干新厂、师傅带徒弟、现场参观学习等办法来进行培训。如制糖工业所需要的大批干部和技术力量，主要由本区的贵县、伶俐、明阳等几个老糖厂进行培训。其余如钢铁厂、化肥厂、水泥厂、石油厂和水电站等方面的技术力量，分别送到辽宁、吉林、江苏、广东和北京、重庆等省（市）代为培养。
    本报合肥13日电　记者于风报道：安徽省在地方工业大发展中，为了使各县领导干部更好地懂得工业、领导工业，最近组织了全省六十多个中共县级工业部长到工厂去参观学习。这项措施取得了很好的效果。
    去各地参观的干部，已参观了蚌埠、淮南、合肥三市二十三个各种不同类型的大、中、小型厂矿。在参观中，采用参观与讲课并重的方法，由厂长和工程师讲课、解答问题，最后讨论，达到了大致能掌握办工业的基本知识的要求。
    经过近一月的参观学习，各县办工业的积极性更加高涨了。大家一致认为参观学习的办法很好，时间短，收效快，比进训练班学习的效用大。学习前，有些县计划办的工厂，不知要些什么设备。如和县想办造纸厂、针织厂，滁县想办水泥厂、玻璃厂、锯木厂，虽有原料，但不知要那些设备，一直没有办起来。经过参观学习，现在这两个县的干部心中有数了，信心也大了。过去没有办起来的工厂，现在就可以办起来了。
    他们在参观学习中，更进一步明确了办地方工业的方向和规模。学习前，有的人认为“办工业就是机械化，就是要大量投资”。有一个县计划办玻璃厂，投资十五万元还嫌少。当他们参观了合肥玻璃厂，看到这个厂投资才五万元，不仅能生产日常用品，还能生产医药用品后，才看清了发展地方工业的正确道路。有的县认为制耐火砖、水泥的厂，不是县的能力可以办到的，因此有原料也不敢办厂。参观后他们联系本县实际，修改原订计划，提出了增加办厂的新项目。并且看到生产低标号水泥、人造棉、杂毛加工、陶瓷、耐火砖等的厂都具有投资少、设备不多、操作简单、有销路等特点，各县都根据本县特点纷纷举办。
