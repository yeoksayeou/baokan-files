　　Starting with Heart-to-Heart Talks
　　Zang Kejia
    The democratic parties without party affiliation and non-party personages are now vigorously carrying out the movement of having heart-to-heart talks with the Party. This is a solemn action, indicating the increased ideological awareness of intellectuals in the anti-Rightist and double-anti movements, willing to hand over everything, including ugliness, to the Party, that is, determined to abandon individualism and devote themselves wholeheartedly to the great socialist collective.
    When having a heart-to-heart talk, one should hand over everything without reservation, because a person only has one heart.
    When having a heart-to-heart talk, everyone will naturally deeply analyze their own thoughts and recall what unfavorable things they have done to the Party. The hearts of bourgeois intellectuals are often covered with a layer of dust. Today, when having a heart-to-heart talk with the Party, these dirty things should be swept away, making it as white and bright as a mirror.
    When I recall my past, a very painful thing comes to my mind. At the end of April last year, I wrote a short article "Disowning Relatives," which was published on the eighth page of the "People's Daily" on May 3. Although the article was small, it had a significant negative impact. Although a year has passed, the heavy and painful feeling it caused in my heart has not diminished due to the passage of time.
    For many years, I have been following the Party, and the Party trusts me and cultivates me. During the Hungarian incident and the initial period of the Rightists' frantic attacks on the Party, my thoughts and feelings did not waver, and I firmly stood on the side of safeguarding the Party. However, I wrote such an article as "Disowning Relatives." Loving something but unintentionally damaging it, is the reason why my mood is particularly painful.
    The purpose of writing this article was to raise the issue of emotional exchange and communication between comrades. After the article was published, it attracted people's attention, and many people sympathized with it and liked it. It was later proved that these people's thoughts and feelings had problems. At the time, I only felt that its class viewpoint was not quite right, and I never thought that during the Rightists' attack on the Party, it would be used as a bullet for shooting, playing a serious destructive role and causing great losses to the Party.
    Emotional exchange between comrades did have some problems in the past, and it is okay to raise them for discussion. My major mistake was in saying that the reason why "friendship" could not be established was "mostly due to climate," and that the reason why intellectuals did not dare to "sincerely" confide was due to "some movements" in recent years. This is obviously a distortion and slander of the great significance and achievements of political movements. The opposite is true. On the basis of the double-anti movement, everyone vying to have heart-to-heart talks with the Party is the best example.
    Comrades are comrades-in-arms. One must never make so-called "friends" outside of the relationship with comrades. I remember once listening to Premier Zhou's speech, when he talked about the film "Red Flag on the Green Hill," he said, "Several comrades from our Central Committee went to see it together, and were very moved, because we all personally experienced these situations together." These few words made a deep impression on me, and it deeply touched me. Isn't this the most beautiful and sublime expression of comrades' emotions?
    The "friendship" I mentioned in this article is actually bourgeois friendship, and the emotions I expressed in it are also bourgeois sentiments. Having both a unified will and personal emotional well-being is the most correct way to solve the relationship between the individual and the collective. However, my view was to cut off the first half and only talk about the second half. I only hoped that everyone would feel comfortable with each other, but did not take unified will as a prerequisite. I asked everyone to talk about everything, good or bad, but took this as the goal, not talking it out to get rid of it, as pointed out in the "People's Daily" editorial on April 13, "Stink Out Bourgeois Individualism." Not talking about unified will, only talking about personal emotional well-being, not talking about criticism and cleansing, only talking about saying everything, this way of talking about friendship is purely individualistic. Not only is it not speaking from the proletariat's standpoint, but in this situation, the words spoken will be detrimental to the socialist collective.
    After the anti-Rightist struggle, the bad influence of that short article and the erroneous thoughts and feelings expressed in it became more obvious and more serious.
    For the past twenty years, especially after arriving in Beijing, under the influence and help of the Party, my thoughts have been improving step by step. Individualistic things are decreasing little by little, and collectivistic things are increasing little by little. However, the bourgeois ideas entrenched in the depths of the soul are unwilling to give way all at once. When an opportunity arises, when a specific event occurs, it suddenly leaps out like a tiger. The bourgeois and even some feudal remnants of thought existing in me found a breakthrough in "Disowning Relatives" and expressed themselves.
    Although I have been following the Party politically and have received some training in work, study, and with the help of Party members, because I have participated in very few actual struggles, and I am plagued by illness and unable to go to work for physical training, this has limited the individual politically and in combining with the masses, and the individual's bourgeois ideas have not been thoroughly transformed.
    I have loved friends all my life and am relatively enthusiastic. Whether before liberation in the dark Jiang-controlled area or after liberation in Beijing, there is a political boundary for making friends. However, even among people on the same front, thoughts and feelings are varied, some are advanced, and some are backward.
    Among my acquaintances, there are many who are backward. Although I personally often criticize them, I cannot avoid being influenced by them a little. After several great political movements, some of these people had problems. It is easy to abandon a person politically, but it is painful to abandon a person emotionally. After some pain, one step is raised in thoughts and feelings. This is also a kind of exercise for me. The more exercise, the stronger the political nature, and the healthier the emotions.
    Today, upon analysis, the short article "Disowning Relatives" is a manifestation of the bourgeois and even feudal thoughts existing in me. It has caused great losses to the Party. After the anti-Rightist struggle and in the double-anti struggle, I saw its errors and the serious problems existing in my personal thoughts and feelings. I always keep this matter in my heart as a painful lesson for myself. When having a heart-to-heart talk with the Party, I confess it, urging myself forward and not making such mistakes again.

　　从交心谈起
　　臧克家
    各民主党无和无党派人士，现在正在轰轰烈烈地进行向党交心运动。这是一个庄严的举动，它表示在反右、双反运动中知识分子思想觉悟的提高，愿意丑恶不避地把一切交给党，也就是说，决心抛开个人主义，把自己全身心地投入到社会主义的伟大集体里去。
    交心，要毫无保留地交出去，因为一个人只有一颗心。
    在交心的时候，大家自然会深切地分析一下自己的思想，回忆一下自己曾经作了一些什么对党不利的事情。资产阶级知识分子的心上常常蒙着一层尘土，今天向党交心，应该拂去这些脏东西，使它洁白如一面明镜。
    当我自己在回想自己过去的时候，一件很沉痛的事便来到我的心上。去年4月底，我写了一篇短文“六亲不认”，发表在5月3号“人民日报”八版上。文章虽小，它起的坏作用却不小。事情虽然已经隔了一年了，它在我心上引起的沉重和沉痛感觉，并未因时间的关系而减弱。
    多少年来，我一直跟着党走，党信任我，培植我。匈牙利事件，右派分子向党猖狂进攻的初期，我的思想情感没有动摇，坚决地站在维护党的这方面。可是，我却写了这样一篇“六亲不认”。爱护一件东西，无意中又毁伤了它，我的心情所以格外沉痛就在这里。
    这篇文章写作的目的，是想提出同志之间情感交流，心和心交通的问题。这篇文章发表以后，引起了人们的注意，许多人同情它，喜爱它。事后证明，这些人的思想情感都存在着问题。我当时只感觉到它的阶级观点不大对头，决没想到，在右派向党进攻的时候，它被利用为射击的子弹，起了严重的破败作用，给党造成了很大的损失。
    同志之间的情感交流，过去的确存在着一些问题，提出来研究商讨是可以的。我的重大错误，是在把“友谊”的不能建立的原因说成“多半是由于气候的关系”，把知识分子的不敢“热情率真”的倾心，说成为由于几年来的“一些运动”的关系。这显然是歪曲了、诬蔑了政治运动的重大意义和它的成果。事实恰恰是相反的。在双反运动的基础上，人人争着向党交心，就是一个最好的例证。
    同志就是战友。决不能在同志关系之外，另外去交所谓“朋友”。我记得有一次听周总理讲话，谈到“翠岗红旗”这部影片的时候，他说“我们中央的几位同志，一道去看了，感动得很，因为这些情况，我们都共同亲身经历过。”这几句话给我的印象很深，它深深的打动了我。这不是同志情感最美好、最崇高的表现吗？
    我在这篇文章里所说的“友谊”，实际上就是资产阶级的友谊，我在其中流露的情感也就是资产阶级的温情。既有统一意志又有个人心情舒畅——这是解决个人与集体关系的最正确的说法。而我的看法，却是砍去了前半截，只谈后半截。我只希望彼此心情舒畅，却不把统一意志作为前题，我要求大家无话不谈，不管好话坏话，但把这作为目的，并不是谈出来为了除掉它，像4月13日“人民日报”社论“搞臭资产阶级的个人主义”里所指出的那样。不讲统一意志只谈个人心情舒畅，不讲批判清扫，只讲什么话都讲，这样讲友情，是纯粹个人主义的，不但没有站在无产阶级立场上讲话，在这情况下交谈出来的话是会不利于社会主义集体的。
    经过反右斗争，那篇短文的恶劣影响和表现在其中的我的错误思想情感也就更加明显，更加严重了。
    二十年来，特别到了北京以后，在党的影响和帮助下，自己的思想在一步步提高。个人主义的东西，一点一点地在减少，集体主义的东西一点一点地在增多。但是，盘踞在灵魂深处的资产阶级思想不肯一下子就让位。遇到一个时机，碰上某一个具体事件，它突然一跃而出，像一只猛虎。我身上存在资产阶级甚至一些封建残余思想，它找到“六亲不认”这个缺口表现了出来。
    我虽然在政治上一直追随着党，在工作、学习和党员同志的帮助下，也得到一些锻炼，但因为参加实际斗争很少，疾病缠身，又无法到劳动中去锻炼，这就使得个人在政治上，在和群众结合方面，受到了限制，个人的资产阶级思想得不到彻底的改造。
    我生平爱朋友，也比较热情。不论解放前在黑暗的蒋管区，还是解放后在北京，交友是有一条政治界限的。可是，同属于一条战线的人，思想情感也是形形色色的，有先进的，有落后的。
    在我的一些熟人中，就有不少是落后的，虽然我个人也经常对他们进行一些批评，相反的，也不能不受到他们一点影响。经过几次伟大的政治运动，其中有些人发生了问题。在政治上放弃一个人容易，在情感上放弃一个人是有痛苦的。经过一番痛苦，思想情感上提高一步。这对我也是一种锻炼。越锻炼政治性越强，情感也越健康。
    今天分析起来，“六亲不认”这篇短文，是存在在我身上的资产阶级甚至封建思想的一种表现。它给党造成了重大的损失，在反右斗争过后，在双反斗争当中，我看到了它的错误和个人思想情感上所存在的严重问题。我时时把这件事放在心上，作为一个人沉痛的教训。在向党交心的时候，我把它交代出来，策鞭自己前进，不要再犯这样的错误。
