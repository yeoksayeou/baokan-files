    In Mag 각 Zhuang Village, a deep mountain area of Laishui County, Hebei Province, there is a type of fish known as the "fish that never sees the light of day." This fish emerges from mountain springs at the foot of the mountain. The shape of the fish is neither carp nor silver carp. The flesh is thick and delicious, and the head and tail are golden yellow, hence the name "Goldfish."

    This year, due to the excavation of these mountain springs and the constant blasting of rocks day and night, the fish are afraid to come out. It is estimated that a large number of fish will appear after the spring excavation is stopped.

    泉中“金鱼”
    河北涞水县深山区马各庄村，有一种被人称为“不见天日”的鱼。这种鱼是从山脚下的山泉里钻出来的。鱼的形状非鲢、非鲤，肉厚鲜美，鱼头、鱼尾呈金黄色，故又有“金鱼”之称。
    今年，由于开凿这几处山泉，日夜鸣炮崩石，鱼不敢出来。估计在停止开泉后还会大量出鱼。
