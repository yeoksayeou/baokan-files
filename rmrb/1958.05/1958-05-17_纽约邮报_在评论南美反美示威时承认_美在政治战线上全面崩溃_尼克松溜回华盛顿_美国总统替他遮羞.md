Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 16th Dispatch: U.S. Vice President Nixon, who was cursed and chased by crowds everywhere in Latin America, ended his eight-nation Latin American trip one day early and returned to Washington on the 15th.

The U.S. government, in a show of pretending to cover up Nixon's shameful failure, mobilized tens of thousands of people to welcome him and express "sympathy" to Nixon.

U.S. President Eisenhower personally led senior officials to the airport to greet Nixon. At the welcoming ceremony, Eisenhower resorted to old tricks, attempting to portray the anti-American demonstrations held by the people of Latin American countries during Nixon's visit as "instigated by the Communists." He also self-deprecatingly stated that these anti-American demonstrations "do not affect" the "traditional friendship" between the United States and Latin American countries. In his speech, Nixon tried his best to conceal the truth, saying that the "majority" of people in Latin America are still "friendly" to the United States, but he also had to admit: "This does not mean that all the people in these countries agree with American policies," "I have found in many areas that the people there do not agree with our practices."

On the same day, Nixon discussed the situation in Latin America with Eisenhower and U.S. Secretary of State Dulles. Nixon later told reporters that "there is a need to re-evaluate U.S. policy toward Latin America." According to reports, following Nixon's remarks, the U.S. government is likely to reorganize the State Department's Bureau of Latin American Affairs and replace some ambassadors to Latin American countries.

At the same time, American newspapers continue to comment on the anti-American demonstrations in Latin America. "New York Post" commentator Lerner wrote: "This is a complete collapse of the current American position on the political front." He said that Latin America's "resentment and hatred" towards the United States has "united anti-American elements of all political colors." "We should now admit that the flags and slogans raised from one corner of the world to another are not in support of us but against us."

The "New York World-Telegram and Sun" concluded that "From the intensity of anti-American sentiment in Venezuela and other countries, it can be said that there is virtually no pro-American sentiment in these places sufficient to counter these hostile attacks. ..."

　　“纽约邮报”在评论南美反美示威时承认
　　美在政治战线上全面崩溃
    尼克松溜回华盛顿　美国总统替他遮羞
    新华社16日讯　华盛顿消息：在拉丁美洲到处遭到群众咒骂和追打的美国副总统尼克松，提前一天结束了他的拉丁美洲八国之行，在15日回到华盛顿。
    美国政府为了替尼克松可耻的失败遮羞，故作姿态地动员了好几万人出来欢迎，对尼克松表示“慰问”。
    美国总统艾森豪威尔亲自率领高级官员到机场迎接尼克松。在欢迎仪式上，艾森豪威尔重施故技，企图把拉丁美洲各国人民在尼克松访问期间所举行的反美示威说成是“共产党指使的”。他并且自我解嘲地表示这些反美示威“并不影响”美国与拉丁美洲国家间的“传统友谊”。尼克松在讲话时竭力掩饰真相说，拉丁美洲“多数人”对美国还是“友好”的，但他同时不得不承认：“这并不意味着这些国家所有的人民都是同意美国的政策的”，“我在很多地区都发现，那里的人民不同意我们的做法”。
    当天，尼克松同艾森豪威尔和美国国务卿杜勒斯讨论了拉丁美洲局势。尼克松事后对记者表示，“需要重新估价美国对拉丁美洲的政策”。据报道，在尼克松的这番谈话之后，美国政府很可能要改组国务院的拉丁美洲事务局和撤换一些驻拉丁美洲国家的大使。
    同时，美国报纸继续评论拉丁美洲的反美示威。“纽约邮报”评论员勒纳写道：“这是当前美国在政治战线上的阵地的全面崩溃”。他说，拉丁美洲对美国的“愤慨和仇恨”把“具有各种政治色彩的反美分子都团结了起来。”“我们现在应该承认，从世界的这一角到另外一角所高举的旗帜和高呼的口号，都不是拥护我们而是反对我们的”。
    “纽约世界电讯和太阳报”的结论是，“从委内瑞拉和其他国家反美情绪强烈的程度看来，可以说这些地方事实上就不存在有足以对抗这些敌对性攻击的亲美情绪。……”
