(Comprehensive report from our newspaper) According to Xinhua News Agency: On the eve of "May Day," the working people of all countries are enthusiastically preparing to welcome International Labor Day—a day for the great solidarity of the working class around the world.

    Soviet Union
    In recent days, to welcome "May Day," the people of the Soviet capital have been busy decorating Moscow to make it even more solemn and beautiful.
    Moscow residents are actively preparing for the holiday parade and buying holiday gifts. Nearly 10,000 professional and amateur performers have rehearsed programs, ready to perform in various squares and parks. Mass holiday carnivals will be held in fifty locations throughout the city.

    German Democratic Republic
    The Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the Central Council of the Free German Trade Union Federation, and the National Council of the National Front of Democratic Germany jointly issued a "May Day" appeal. The appeal extended congratulations to the working people of the German Democratic Republic—workers, farmers, intellectuals, and middle-class people, as well as soldiers of the National People's Army—and called on them to continue to work hard to consolidate the German Democratic Republic, strive to restore the unity of the German people by establishing an all-German confederation, and resolutely oppose West Germany's establishment of atomic weapons.

    Indonesia
    In its "May Day" International Labor Day message issued on April 28, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party called for strengthening Indonesia's national unity and strengthening the unity within the ranks of the working class in order to completely crush domestic rebellion and foreign interference.

    Japan
    On the evening of April 28, more than 10,000 workers, youth, women, students, and general citizens in Tokyo held a celebration meeting at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium on the eve of "May Day" International Labor Day.
    Takayoshi Haraguchi, Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Inejiro Asanuma, Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, and Shigeo Kamiya, a representative of the Communist Party, spoke at the meeting successively. They unanimously called for uniting the strength of workers and people participating in the "May Day" International Labor Day activities, crushing the Japanese government's illegal suppression of teacher's unions and the All-Japan Postal Workers' Union, and striving to elect more progressive and democratic figures as members of parliament in the upcoming general election.

    France
    On April 23, the leading body of the French Communist Party issued a "May Day" letter to the working people of France, congratulating the French working class and all working people, and calling on them to participate in "May Day" demonstrations, strive to meet their social and economic demands, stop the rise of fascists, restore peace in Algeria, save France and the world from the threat of atomic war, and strive for the victory of national independence, peace, and disarmament policies.

    United States
    A recent issue of the American "Worker's Weekly" published an article on "May Day." The article wrote: "Internationalism will become a great force on May 1, 1958, as it demonstrates the solidarity of the people of all countries, even those in the most distant parts of the earth, in the struggle for peace, against colonialism, and for socialism."

    The weekly also published an article by Communist leader Dennis entitled "May Day," American Trade Unions and Communists."
    Dennis said that the obligation of the American working class and the American Communist Party is to "build an alliance of workers, farmers, Negroes, intellectuals, and small business owners against economic depression, to limit monopoly capital, to elect Congress and legislative assemblies that care about the needs and will of the people, to prevent the disaster of nuclear war, and to establish good neighborly relations and peaceful coexistence between all peoples."
