    Eliminating Waterlogging, Protecting Seedlings and Ensuring Harvests
    The broad masses of farmers in Hubei Province have been clearing ditches and draining waterlogged fields in the rain for days on end, rushing to transplant and sow, protecting seedlings and ensuring harvests.
    Now, it is the plum rain season in the South. Since late April, there have been few sunny days in parts of Hubei Province, with continuous overcast and rain. The rainfall in counties like Mianyang, Jianli, and Hanchuan, located in the Jianghan Plain, has been much higher than in the same period in previous years. Some low-lying areas have already suffered from waterlogging due to excessive rainfall, some wheat has been affected by diseases, and some cotton seedlings and rice seedlings have suffered significant losses; some fields have been submerged by waterlogging.
    Faced with the incessant rain and waterlogging, the people of Hubei Province have demonstrated a tenacious and heroic spirit. This is another great battle against nature following the upsurge in water conservancy construction. In these days, according to statistics from Mianyang, Qianjiang, Jianli and other counties alone, the number of people fighting against waterlogging day and night has reached more than 300,000. More than 40,000 waterwheels are being used every day, in addition to a large number of water buckets, pumps, basins, and scoops.
    In these days, the vast majority of rural cadres in Hubei Province have been leading by example, wearing raincoats and straw hats, working alongside farmers to drain waterlogged fields and rush to plant and transplant. Many county party secretaries, county heads, and the vast majority of district and township leaders have recently been in the worst-affected areas, leading farmers in the fight against the disaster.

    排除渍水  保种保收
    湖北省广大农民连日冒雨清沟排渍，抢插抢种，保种保收。
    现在，正值南方的梅雨季节。从4月下旬起，湖北省部分地区就没晴过几回好天，阴雨绵绵。地处江汉平原的沔阳、监利、汉川等县，雨量都比往年同期多得多。有些低洼地区由于雨水太多，已经遭到了渍水灾害，有些地区的小麦已经发生了病害，有的棉苗、秧苗遭受很大损失；部分田地已被渍水淹没。
    在霪雨和渍水的面前，湖北省人民表现了顽强的英雄气概。这是继兴修水利高潮之后向大自然进行的又一大战斗。在这些日子里，仅据沔阳、潜江、监利等县统计，日日夜夜与渍水作战的人数就达三十多万。每天出动的水车有四万多部，另外，还有大量的挑水桶、抽水机以及脸盆、水瓢等。
    这些日子，湖北省广大农村干部个个以身作则，披蓑衣、戴?笠，与农民一道抢排渍水，抢种抢插。不少县的县委书记、县长以及广大区、乡领导干部最近都在受渍最严重的地区，领导农民进行抗灾斗争。
