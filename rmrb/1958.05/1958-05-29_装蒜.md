Notes

　　Feigning Ignorance
　　After the American pilot, who assisted Indonesian rebels in bombing, was captured by the Indonesian government army, White, the U.S. State Department's press officer, said on May 27 that he "knew nothing about the news that an American had been flying a bomber for the Indonesian rebels."

　　However, White "knew nothing" does not mean that the matter did not exist. The "living witness" is now in Jakarta, and his confession is written in black and white, which cannot be denied. Moreover, the whole world knows about this matter, except for the U.S. State Department's press officer, who "knows nothing." Is he really so ignorant and ill-informed? Of course not. White is merely trying to cover up the embarrassing appearance of the American interventionists by feigning ignorance.

    装蒜
    在协助印度尼西亚叛乱分子进行轰炸的美国飞行员被印度尼西亚政府军抓到以后，美国国务院新闻发布官怀特于5月27日说，他“一点也不知道关于有一个美国人一直为印度尼西亚叛乱分子驾驶轰炸机的消息”。
    可是，怀特“一点也不知道”，并不等于事情就不存在。“活见证”现在就在雅加达，他的口供是黑字写在白纸上，决赖不掉。而且全世界都知道了这件事情，唯独美国国务院的新闻发布官“一点也不知道”，难道真是孤陋寡闻吗？当然不是。怀特不过是想用装蒜的办法来掩饰美国干涉者的狼狈相而已。
