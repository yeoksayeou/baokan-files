Xiang embroidery is a special handicraft of Hunan Province. As early as 1898, embroidery workshops were established in Changsha. Xiang embroidery declined before liberation. After liberation, the production of Xiang embroidery has greatly developed. After the embroiderers joined the production cooperatives in 1956, production increased even faster. The total output value this year will increase more than fifty times compared to 1952.

　　绣花工厂
    长沙市正在动工兴建一座湘绣厂。这座工厂将是占地四千平方公尺的四层楼房。为了便于生产、参观和销售，门市部、展览室和生产车间都在这座楼上。
    湘绣是湖南省的特种手工艺品，早在1898年，长沙就成立了绣坊。解放前，湘绣曾衰落下去。解放后湘绣生产得到很大发展。1956年绣工们加入生产合作社以后，生产增加更快。今年的总产值将比1952年增加五十多倍。
