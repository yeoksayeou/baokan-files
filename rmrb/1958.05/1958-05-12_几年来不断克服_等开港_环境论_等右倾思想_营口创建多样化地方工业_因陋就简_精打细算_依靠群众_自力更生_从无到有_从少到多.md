　　Yingkou Creates Diversified Local Industries by Constantly Overcoming Right-Leaning Ideologies such as "Waiting for the Opening of a Port" and "Environmentalism"
　　Making Do with Crude Resources, Practicing Careful Calculation, Relying on the Masses, Self-Reliance, From Nothing to Something, From Few to Many
　　(Our Dispatch) In the short few years since liberation, Yingkou City, Liaoning Province, has transformed from a backward consumer city into a thriving production city by continuously overcoming right-leaning conservative ideas such as "waiting for the opening of a port" and "environmentalism" among cadres, and actively restoring and developing local industries. At present, the number of local state-owned factories in the city has developed to more than 100, and the total output value in 1957 increased by 38 times compared with 1949; the number of employees has increased by more than 10 times; the variety of products has increased from 7 to 1,029; and the technical level has also been greatly improved. Urban unemployment has been eliminated, and people's lives have improved. This year, the people of the city have set off a new upsurge in the development of local industries, and the total output value of local industries from January to April increased by 58% compared with the same period last year.
　　In the development of local industries, Yingkou City has implemented the policy of the whole party running industry, all levels running industry, and the whole people running industry, and has created various forms of developing local industries. In addition to larger industries, it has boldly established district-level joint factories and small factories in street offices. In addition, the civil affairs department of the Municipal People's Committee has established social relief production and welfare societies; the handicraft industry cooperative has organized various production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, production groups, and household side businesses. All departments in the city have tried their best to compress expenditure and squeeze out money to support and develop local industries, creating a new situation in the city of supporting local industries.
　　In the development of local industries, Yingkou City has made efforts to make do with crude resources, rely on self-reliance, and implement the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. They use and repair old houses and rent private houses as factory buildings; in terms of production equipment, they try their best to use old equipment and substitute equipment, or make simple equipment themselves, and buy less new equipment. Most of the funds for local industries are raised by organizing the masses to raise funds themselves, and the principal and interest are repaid at the bank interest rate. In terms of technical force, they mainly rely on veteran workers and organize them to study in other places to solve the problem.
　　The reason why the local industry in Yingkou City can develop rapidly is mainly: adopting the method of "hen laying eggs" and "mother factory splitting into subsidiaries" to cultivate new factories from the original factories, which is relatively easy and fast. They also adopt the method of large factories leading small factories, which can not only save equipment, but also make the factories develop and improve more quickly. In addition, they also adopt the method of gradually upgrading handcraft cooperatives or welfare production units with development prospects and production nature suitable for state operation to local state-owned factories, so that local factories can develop quickly (for details, see page 3 of today's newspaper).

　　几年来不断克服“等开港”“环境论”等右倾思想
　　营口创建多样化地方工业
　　因陋就简　精打细算　依靠群众　自力更生　从无到有　从少到多
    本报讯　辽宁省营口市在解放后短短几年内，由于不断克服干部中“等开港”、“环境论”等右倾保守思想，积极恢复和发展地方工业，从一个落后的消费城市改造成为欣欣向荣的生产城市。现在全市地方国营工厂已发展到一百多个，1957年的生产总值比1949年增加了三十八倍；职工人数增加了十倍以上；产品品种由七种增加到一千零二十九种；技术水平也有很大提高。城市失业现象已消灭，人民生活有了改善。今年全市人民更掀起了发展地方工业的高潮，1至4月份的地方工业总产值比去年同期增长了58％。
    营口市在发展地方工业中，贯彻了全党办工业、各级办工业、全民办工业的方针，创造了多种多样发展地方工业的形式。除了较大的工业外，放手举办区级联合工厂和街道办事处小型工厂。此外还由市人民委员会民政部门建立了社会救济性的生产福利社；由手工业联社组织了各种生产社、供销社、生产小组及家庭副业。全市各部门都尽量压缩经费开支，挤出钱来支援和发展地方工业，使全市出现了一个支援地方工业的新局面。
    营口市在发展地方工业中，作到了因陋就简、自力更生、贯彻了勤俭办企业的方针。他们利用和修补旧房、租用民房做厂房；在生产设备上，他们尽量利用旧设备和代用设备，或自制简易设备，少买新设备。地方工业的资金，大半是组织群众自筹，按银行利率加息还本。在技术力量方面主要依靠老工人和组织到外地学习等办法来解决。
    营口市地方工业所以能够得到迅速的发展，主要是：采用母鸡下蛋、母厂劈子厂的办法，从原有的工厂中培植新工厂，这样就比较容易而且也快。他们还采用大厂带小厂的做法，这样既能节约设备，又能使工厂发展和提高得比较迅速。此外还采用逐步升级，把有发展前途、生产性质又适合于国家经营的手工业合作社或福利生产单位，逐渐升级为地方国营工厂等办法，使地方工厂能够很快地发展起来（详见今日本报第三版）。
