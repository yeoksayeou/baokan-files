Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th. Japanese Jiji Press reported from Osaka on the 15th that Japan's Toyo Rayon Co. was "greatly puzzled" by a telegram purportedly received on Wednesday from a Chinese company in Shanghai, requesting the immediate shipment of 5,000 pounds of rayon to China. They claimed that China "violated a series of formal notices already issued to cease trade" and deliberately portrayed this incident as being due to "special rayon not being available in Europe." A Xinhua News Agency reporter specifically visited the Shanghai Special Arts and Crafts Company, which purchases Japanese rayon, regarding this matter. The head of the company stated: The aforementioned report by Japan is purely a deliberate distortion of the facts, intended to confuse the public, and is driven by ulterior motives. He said that the Shanghai Special Arts and Crafts Company, like the rest of the business community in China, is extremely indignant at the Kishi Nobusuke government's condoning of thugs who insulted the Chinese national flag, and resolutely ceased trade with Japan after Kishi Nobusuke undermined Sino-Japanese trade.

He specifically pointed out that the so-called rayon issue concerns the fulfillment of letters of credit that were opened before our notification to Japanese businesses to stop issuing further letters of credit, after Kishi Nobusuke damaged Sino-Japanese trade. He said that on April 15th of this year, the Shanghai Special Arts and Crafts Company opened a letter of credit to the Japanese CHORI company for the purchase of 3,000 pounds of rayon. On May 9th, because the Kishi Nobusuke government undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and condoned thugs in Nagasaki who insulted our national flag, the conditions for conducting trade between China and Japan on the basis of equality and mutual benefit were destroyed. Therefore, it was necessary to notify the relevant Japanese businesses to cease all business dealings except for already opened letters of credit. On May 14th, in response to a telegram from the Japanese CHORI company, the Shanghai Special Arts and Crafts Company, following the principles of the May 9th notification to Japanese businesses, agreed that the batch of rayon for which a letter of credit had already been issued could still be executed. Therefore, there is no question of any "exceptional handling" whatsoever, and it is even less a matter of "not being able to find supply in Europe," as maliciously propagated by the Japanese Jiji Press. The real intention behind this Japanese news agency's painstaking fabrication of facts and reversal of black and white is nothing more than to create an excuse for Kishi Nobusuke's shameless claim that China cannot do business without Japan, in order to deceive the public and mislead the Japanese people.

The head emphasized that Sino-Japanese trade cannot be restored unless Kishi Nobusuke changes his attitude of hostility towards the Chinese people. He also said that if Sino-Japanese trade continues to be interrupted as a result, it will not bring any impact to our socialist economic construction. Didn't our country still victoriously overfulfill the First Five-Year Plan when the Japanese government followed the US imperialism to implement an "embargo" against our country? Moreover, commodities like rayon neither play a decisive role in our economic construction, nor can they be bought anywhere on the international market. At the same time, in the situation of the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, it will not take long before they can also be produced domestically in large quantities. The Japanese Jiji Press's choice of rayon to make a fuss about is a futile effort.

### 日本时事通讯社造谣为岸信介帮腔  上海特种工艺品公司负责人严加驳斥

    日本时事通讯社造谣为岸信介帮腔
　　上海特种工艺品公司负责人严加驳斥
    新华社上海19日电　日本时事通讯社15日从大阪报道，日本东洋人造丝公司对于所谓星期三接到上海一家中国公司的电报，要求立即将订购的五千磅人造丝运往中国一事“大惑不解”，认为中国“违反了已发出的停止贸易的一系列的正式通知”，并且把这件事故意说成是由于“特种人造丝在欧洲找不到供应”的缘故。新华社记者特为此事走访购买日本人造丝的上海特种工艺品公司，这个公司的负责人说：日本的上述报道，纯系有意歪曲事实，混淆视听，是别有用心的。他说，上海特种工艺品公司和全国工商界一样，对于岸信介政府纵容暴徒污辱中国国旗的行为万分愤慨，在岸信介破坏了中日贸易以后，坚决地停止了对日本的贸易。
    他特别指出，所谓人造丝问题，是在岸信介破坏了中日贸易以后履行在我方通知日商停止继续开证前已经开出的信用证问题。他说，今年4月15日上海特种工艺品公司向日本CHORI公司开出购买三千磅人造丝的信用证。5月9日由于岸信介政府破坏了第四次中日贸易协定，又纵容暴徒在长崎污辱我国国旗，中日两国间在平等互利基础上进行贸易的条件遭到破坏，因此不得不通知有关日商。除了已开出的信用证外，停止一切业务往来。5月14日上海特种工艺品公司在答复日本CHORI公司来电时即按照5月9日通知日商的原则，同意这批已开证的人造丝仍可继续执行。因此根本不存在什么“例外处理”问题，更不像日本时事通讯社所恶意喧嚷的“在欧洲找不到供应”的问题。这家日本通讯社这样煞费苦心地捏造事实，颠倒黑白，其真实用意无非是为了给岸信介的所谓中国非同日本做生意不可的无耻谰言制造借口，以蒙蔽视听，欺骗日本人民。
    这位负责人强调指出，岸信介不改变敌视中国人民的态度，中日贸易就无法恢复。他还说，如果因此而使中日贸易继续中断下去，绝不会给我国社会主义经济建设带来任何影响，日本政府追随美帝国主义对我国实行“禁运”，我国不是同样胜利地超额完成了第一个五年计划吗？何况像人造丝这样的商品，对于我国经济建设既不起丝毫决定性的作用，又可以在国际市场上随处买到，同时在我国工农业生产大跃进的形势下，不会经过多久时间，国内也可以大批生产。日本时事通讯社选择人造丝做文章，是枉费心机的。
