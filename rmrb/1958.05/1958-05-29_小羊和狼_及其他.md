    “The Little Sheep and the Wolf” and Others

    Since 1957, the China Children's Publishing House has successively published more than twenty titles in the Preschool Children's Literature Series (including fairy tales, poetry collections, riddles, and interesting ironic sayings, etc.). This series has been widely used in kindergarten teaching. Because the content of the works suits the age characteristics of preschool children, the quality of the illustrations is also high, and the decorations are beautiful, they are welcomed by children and educators.

    A large number of these are fairy tales. Fairy tales play a significant role in the comprehensive development and moral cultivation of young children. They educate children on how to live, inspire them to sympathize with all good and positive images, encourage them to learn from these images, and use them as role models for how to conduct themselves, while also fostering hatred for negative characters.

    For example, in the myth "The Golden Axe," we see a clear contrast between two distinct images: one is Chen Ping, who is diligent, honest, and kind; the other, in contrast to Chen Ping, is Wang Bopi, who is cruel and stingy. Although there is no explicit preaching here, children who listen to this story know whom to love and whom to hate. At the same time, the appearance of the old immortal in the story, who helps the honest and hardworking Chen Ping and punishes Wang Bopi, is a great satisfaction for preschool children.

    The illustrations in this book are also beautiful. First of all, the character illustrations in the book have the function of portraits, with Chen Ping, the old immortal, and Wang Bopi all having distinct physical characteristics. At the same time, all the illustrations have Chinese national characteristics.

    "The Little Sheep and the Wolf" is also a good work. It contains the struggle between good and evil, with all the animals helping the kind little sheep, and they unite to defeat the old wolf.

    The text of this fairy tale is concise, without redundant or lengthy sentences, and uses a repetitive form, which can help and consolidate the child's memory, enabling the child to easily remember the main plot of the fairy tale and even memorize it.

    Fairy tales about nature, such as "A Wounded Little Bird," are also good works. It describes the bird mother's care and love for the little bird; it describes the friendship between the tree and the little bird; at the same time, through the development of the plot, it gives children some understandable natural knowledge: the relationship between birds and trees with the seasons. When winter comes, some birds fly to warmer places to spend the winter, and mulberry trees and maple trees lose their leaves, but the old cypress trees do not lose their leaves, and they are not afraid of wind and snow.

    The collections of nursery rhymes and short poems, with diverse content and themes, are mostly good works for preschool children to develop their language, understand society, and understand nature. The colors of the illustrations are also very rich. Short poems are excellent teaching materials for memorizing poems in kindergartens.

    However, it is regrettable that there is not a single story about depicting real life in this series of preschool children's literature.

    Children's literature is a powerful tool for conducting communist education for young children, cultivating their excellent moral qualities, and introducing them to the world around them. Therefore, kindergartens need stories that reflect real life, such as stories depicting the motherland, stories depicting labor and the working people, and stories depicting the lives of children and adults. Especially today, when a world-shaking high tide of socialist construction has been launched in every corner of our country, the face of nature is changing every moment, and miracles and heroic figures are constantly emerging... We should introduce all of this to the children. We should use these works to carry out language teaching, to enrich children's knowledge, to cultivate children's love for the motherland, and to realize the task of communist education. It is hoped that our writers and artists can also make a great leap forward and write more and higher-quality works for our preschool children.

    ·给少年儿童介绍的好书·
    “小羊和狼”及其他
    于陆琳
    从1957年起，中国少年儿童出版社陆续出版了二十多本学前儿童文艺丛书（其中有童话，有小诗集，有谜语，还有有趣的反话等等）。这一套丛书，在幼儿园的教学中被广泛地应用着，由于作品的内容适合学前儿童年龄的特点，插图的质量也较高，加上装璜美丽，因此受到儿童和教养员的欢迎。
    在这里面占较多数量的是童话。童话在幼儿的全面发展和道德品质的培养上是有很大的作用的。它们教育幼儿如何去生活，激发幼儿同情一切好的正面的形象，愿意向他们学习，以他们做为处人处世的榜样，憎恨反面的人物。
    如神话“金斧头”的故事，在这个神话中我们看到二个鲜明的形象的对比，一个是勤劳，诚实，善良的陈平。另一个和陈平成为对比的形象是王剥皮，他残暴，贪吝。在这里虽然没有说教，但是幼儿听了这个故事以后是知道爱谁，憎谁的。同时故事中老神仙的出现，他帮助诚实勤劳的陈平，惩治了王剥皮，这样一个结局对学前儿童来说，也是一个很大的满足。
    这本书的插图也是优美的，首先书中人物的插图都具有肖像的作用，陈平，老神仙，王剥皮都有着鲜明的外形特征。同时全部插图都有着我国民族的特色。
    “小羊和狼”也是一本好的作品。这里有着善和恶的斗争，所有的动物都来帮助善良的小羊，他们团结一致战胜了老狼。
    这个童话的文字是简练的，没有多余的和冗长的句子，利用了重复的形式，这就可以帮助和巩固幼儿的记忆，使幼儿能够很容易的记住童话的主要情节，甚至于把它背诵下来。
    关于自然的童话：“一只受伤的小鸟”等，也是好的作品。它描写了鸟妈妈对小鸟的关心和爱护；描写了树和小鸟之间的友谊；同时，通过故事情节的发展，给了幼儿一些可以理解的自然知识：鸟类和树同季节的关系。冬天来了，有些鸟类飞到暖和的地方去过冬，桑树，枫树都落叶了，但是老柏树不落叶，他不怕风雪。
    儿歌和小诗的集子，内容和题材多种多样，对于学前儿童发展语言，认识社会，认识自然，大部分都是好的作品，插图的色彩也很丰富。短小的诗歌，在幼儿园中用来做为熟记诗的作业是很好的教材。
    但是遗憾的是，这一套学前儿童文艺丛书中没有一个关于描写现实生活的故事。
    儿童文艺作品是向幼儿进行共产主义教育的强有力的工具，通过文艺作品，培养幼儿的优良的道德品质，介绍幼儿认识周围世界。因此在幼儿园中，很需要反映现实生活的故事，如描写祖国的，描写劳动和劳动人民的，描写儿童和成人的生活故事。尤其是在今天，在我国各个角落都掀起了翻天覆地的社会主义建设的高潮，自然的面貌每时每刻都起着变化，奇迹和英雄人物不断的出现……这一切，我们都应该介绍给孩子们。通过这些作品来进行语言教学，来丰富幼儿的知识，培养幼儿对祖国的爱，实现共产主义教育的任务。希望我们的作家和画家们也能来个大跃进，为我们的学前儿童写出更多、质量更高的作品来。
