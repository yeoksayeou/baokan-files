    Among "Everyone"
    Liu Di
    Each of us now lives in a happy socialist family. As soon as you board a trolleybus, you are greeted with four large characters: "Home of Passengers"; enter a department store and you see "Home of Customers"; in the cinema, it's "Home of the Audience"... It can truly be said that there are homes everywhere. In these "homes," the service personnel and salespersons are all smiles, greeting you upon arrival, bidding you farewell upon departure, and offering attentive, meticulous, and thoughtful service, just like family members. Deeply touched by the care of this socialist family, how can one not feel infinite warmth?
    
    Thus, I thought about the relationships between people in this big family.
    
    In the big family, the relationships between people are a completely new kind of comradely relationship. The business style of shops and service departments has been completely renewed, not only bringing warmth to people, but also bringing people's ideological outlook to a nobler realm. The communist idea of "everyone for me, I for everyone" is gradually permeating people's hearts. In the opinion books of trolleybuses, buses, shops, post offices... everywhere, opening them up, you find them filled with words of gratitude and encouragement. In addition to praise and commendation, many people express their desire to learn from these enthusiastic salespersons and service personnel, and to do their own jobs well. A kind of new moral fashion shines between the lines: everyone for me, and I will be a hundred times for everyone!
    
    However, there are indeed a few customers, passengers, and others who are unaware of the courtesy they receive. These people place themselves outside the socialist family. Not only do they fail to reciprocate with courtesy, but they are also as cold as ice in front of service personnel, as if others owe them a great debt. It's as if they have a natural right to look down on people, as if all service personnel should satisfy their various unreasonable demands. If things don't go their way, they sternly rebuke: "What kind of service attitude is this? What is your work permit number?" They threaten to write a complaint at the slightest provocation. As for those who amuse themselves by making fun of salespersons or playing pranks, and call it "testing her service attitude," it is even more of a vulgar act. In one shop, I saw a customer wanting to take a basket without paying when buying a pound of apples. The salesperson patiently explained to him that it was unnecessary, and that if he wanted a basket, he would need to pay for the packaging. Upon hearing this, the customer immediately loudly questioned: "What kind of Tianqiao style is this? You want money for a basket, you are truly obsessed with money! A merchant's style!" In other places, I have also heard things like "I give you money, so you should..."
    
    The scent of "merchant's style!" and "I give you money, so you should do this and that" can be easily identified. This is the old society's young master treating servants. In their view, the relationship between customers and salespersons is nothing more than a business transaction. I pay money, you sell goods, and while "buying" the goods, I also "buy" the salesperson's respect. Thus, these people always feel superior in front of salespersons and service personnel, while those who "serve people" are humble and not worthy of respect.
    
    Let's hold off on labeling these people. I only feel that their contempt for commercial workers has historical roots. From a broader perspective, it is the remnants of thousands of years of feudal dynasties and Confucian thought promoting "emphasizing agriculture and despising commerce" and "families of farmers and scholars." And the capitalist commercial malpractices of plundering by trickery, speculation and fraud, and harming others to benefit oneself have also left a very bad influence on people. But, more importantly, they lack a correct understanding of the socialist division of labor and the communist spirit of "everyone for me, I for everyone." They can only accept others respecting them, but they do not respect others; they can only accept everyone being for them, but they are not for everyone. Living in the collective of the socialist family, they are wholeheartedly seeking personal convenience and taking care of themselves, which is completely contrary to communist thought, and going further and further away from it.
    
    "Everyone for me, I for everyone" requires people to respect each other, understand each other, encourage and spur each other on, and work together to serve the common cause. Among everyone, you are for me, I am for you, giving as good as one gets, and treating each other with the respect guests. There is an indivisible connection between everyone for me and I for everyone. Without I for everyone, where would everyone for me come from? Therefore, every member of the socialist family should always think of the collective, endure hardship first, and enjoy the benefits later. Anything that is beneficial to the collective should be done with head held high and with joy. Any personal gain or loss should be left behind. If people all hold on to the idea of everyone for me, and I am also for myself, and lose the power of the collective, how can this socialist family leap forward?

    在“人人”之中
    柳地
    我们每一个人现在都生活在幸福的社会主义大家庭之中。一登电车，迎面四个大字：“乘客之家”；走进百货商店，写着“顾客之家”；电影院里，又是“观众之家”……。真可说是到处是家。在这些“家”里，服务员、售货员们，个个春风满面，见面问好，临走道别，体贴细心周到，俨然如同家人一般。身受这社会主义大家庭的关切，怎能不感到无限温暖。
    于是，我想到了在这个大家庭中，人们之间的关系。
    在大家庭中，人们的关系完全是一种崭新的同志关系。商店和服务部门的经营作风焕然一新，不只是给人送来了温暖，还把人们的思想面貌带入一个更加高贵的境地。“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义思想，逐渐渗透到人们心里去了。在电车、汽车、商店、邮局……等各处的意见簿上，翻开一看，密密麻麻满是感激、鼓励的话。表扬、赞许之余，许多人都表示向这些热心服务的售货员、服务员学习，作好自己的工作。字里行间闪烁着一种新的道德风尚的光芒：人人为我，我也要百倍地为人！
    但是，竟也有少数顾客、乘客等人，身受礼遇而不自觉。这些人，把自己置于社会主义大家庭之外，不独不能以礼还礼，反而在服务人员面前冷若冰霜，像是别人都欠他多少债似的。好像他们天生就有这种瞧不起人的权利，好像所有的服务员都应该满足他种种不合理的要求。一不顺心，就厉声呵责：“这是什么服务态度，你的工作证是多少号？”动不动以写一笔意见来吓唬人。至于那种拿售货员开心取乐、恶作剧，还美其名曰：“考验考验她的服务态度”的人，更是下流行径了。我在一家商店里看到，一个顾客买一斤苹果要无代价地装一个筐子，售货员耐心地向他解释说没有必要，而且要装筐，就需要拿包装费，这顾客一听，马上大声责问：“你们这是什么天桥作风？一个筐子也要钱，真是财迷！商人作风！”在别的地方，还听说过“我给你钱，你就应当……”一类的话。
    “商人作风！”、“我给你钱，你就应当如何如何”这种气味，一闻就能辨得出，这是旧社会的少爷在对待仆人。在他们看来，顾客和售货员之间，无非是一种买卖关系。我出钱，你售货，在“买”来用品的同时，也“买”来了售货员的尊重。于是，这些人在售货员、服务员面前，总觉高人一等，而“伺候人”的人却是低三下四，不值得尊重的。
    且慢给这些人扣什么帽子。我只觉得，他们轻视商业工作人员的思想是有着历史根源的。远一点说，是几千年封建王朝、儒家思想宣扬“重农轻商”、“耕读世家”的遗毒。而资本主义商业巧取豪夺、投机诈骗、损人利己等恶习，也给人们留下了极坏的影响。但是，更重要的是，他们对于社会主义社会的劳动分工，对于“人人为我，我为人人”的共产主义精神，缺乏正确认识。只能别人尊重我，我却不尊重别人；只能人人为我，我却不为人人，身在社会主义大家庭的集体之中，一心贪图个人方便，独善其身，这和共产主义思想，岂不南辕北辙，越走越远？
    “人人为我，我为人人”，要求人们互相尊重，互相体谅，互相激励和鞭策，齐心为共同事业服务。人人之间，你为我，我为你，礼尚往来，相敬如宾。人人为我和我为人人两者之间，有着不可分割的联系。没有我为人人，哪里会有人人为我？因此，社会主义大家庭中的每一个成员，都应当处处为集体着想，吃苦在先，享受在后，凡是对集体有益的事情，就昂首阔步欣然而为之。任何个人得失，一律抛在脑后。如果人们都抱着人人为我，我亦为我，失去了集体的力量，这社会主义的大家庭又怎能向前跃进？
