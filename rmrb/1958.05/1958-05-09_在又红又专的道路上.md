In his speech "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Among our many staff members, there is now a dangerous tendency to be unwilling to share weal and woe with the masses and to be fond of calculating personal fame and gain. This is very bad. In the movement to increase production and practice economy, we require the streamlining of institutions, the transfer of cadres to lower levels, and the return of a considerable number of cadres to production. This is a method to overcome this dangerous tendency." The exhibition of production achievements of cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade system, which opened in Beijing on May 5, eloquently proves the brilliance and correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion, showcasing the abundant results achieved by these cadres in labor production and political thought.

Sending cadres to participate in labor and production at the grassroots level and strengthening the production front is an important revolutionary measure of the Party, an important aspect of the Party's cadre line, an important part of this rectification movement, and an important component of the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In the previous period, among many of our staff members, especially among some young intellectual cadres who had not undergone production labor and practical struggle, an erroneous ideological tendency of only being able to be "officials" and not being able to be "people" had grown. Asking them to go to production for labor training made them feel that it was demeaning, a waste of talent, without a future, full of doubts, and with many concerns. These concerns are essentially a reflection of the exploiting class's ideas of despising labor and despising workers and peasants. The cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade system used their own personal experiences and the results they achieved in ideology and production in the past year to thoroughly refute the above-mentioned incorrect views and concerns.

Anhui Province is one of the first provinces to carry out the work of transferring cadres to lower levels. They began transferring cadres to the industrial and agricultural labor fronts in large numbers as early as February of last year. At the beginning, there were also many concerns among the cadres, but after ideological struggle, through persuasion and education, awareness improved, and confidence increased. The situation then changed greatly, from not being able to reduce personnel to being able to reduce a little, to being able to reduce a lot; from being difficult to arrange to being able to arrange, to having great methods. Within a few months, the province had transferred more than 30,000 people from the financial and trade system alone, and this year it plans to reduce another 25,000 people. After a year of production labor practice, the mental outlook and ideological state of the transferred cadres have undergone profound changes. Some people who originally thought that participating in production was unpromising and had no future have now personally experienced the glory and greatness of labor, deeply realized the practical significance of labor creating everything, and have changed from viewing participation in labor training as a daunting task to actively engaging in production labor. This has solved the problem of regarding oneself as a member of the ordinary working people, not just in words, but in actual actions, and placing oneself among the working people. The exploiting class's legacy of "he who excels in learning can become an official" and the concept of despising labor has been broken, and communist ideology is growing. This is a transformation of great significance. Many people who were previously "scholars" who could not carry burdens on their shoulders or baskets in their hands have now mastered some production technologies. Some have become production experts and model workers, and some have even created many new technologies and experiences, greatly improving production efficiency. The arguments that cadres transferred to lower levels can be "red" but not "expert" have also been broken in the face of facts. Facts have proven that as long as you are willing to devote yourself to the cause of the people, learn modestly, and study diligently, you will definitely be able to learn many valuable knowledge that cannot be learned from books, and you will be able to become an expert in your own post. The individual's research is combined with the needs of the socialist cause. In addition, the participation of a large number of cadres in production labor has had a significant impact among the broad masses of working people, and social customs have undergone great changes. Going to the countryside and going up the mountains is becoming a social trend. Those who were not at ease with rural work in the past are now at ease. Some cadres transferred to lower levels not only actively help farmers improve their production technology and cultural level while learning production knowledge and skills from them, but also play a good role in promoting the development of local industry and agriculture, and greatly strengthen the ties between the Party and the masses. All of these powerfully prove that the Party's policy of transferring cadres to lower levels is a completely correct policy.

There are many ways for cadres transferred to lower levels to participate in production. Going to agricultural cooperatives to eat, live, and work with farmers, learning from farmers and helping them, is an important aspect of transferring cadres to lower levels under the current conditions. This is not only to facilitate the establishment of close ties between cadres and the broad masses of peasants, but also because the current state of agricultural production development requires a group of cadres to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. However, when conditions permit and the development of the cause requires it, it is also possible to organize cadres transferred to lower levels to set up factories and farms and engage in collective production. This can also achieve the purpose of training and transforming cadres, and it also has a significant effect on promoting the development of production. In addition to participating in agricultural cooperatives for production labor, the cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade system also established more than 380 production enterprises in accordance with the principles of low investment, quick results, not competing with the people for profit, and combining with the business of their own departments. The total investment was only 7.8 million yuan, and by the end of last year, they had created a wealth of more than 23 million yuan. Practice has proven that these principles are correct. Many production units established by the supply and marketing cooperative system use the agricultural and sideline products and waste materials they have acquired for production. Some small daily necessities processing plants run by the commercial system produce buttons, silk, lotus root flour, etc., which are all made from local materials and processed locally. As a result, not only has local industry been developed, but it has also powerfully promoted the development of the supply and marketing system itself, better serving the countryside.

To organize the production of cadres transferred to lower levels well, so that they can fully play their role in labor, make achievements, and change their mental outlook, the most important and fundamental issue is to strengthen the Party's political and ideological leadership. The experience of Anhui also vividly proves this point. Among the cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade system, there were originally many people who were unwilling to work or despised labor, and thought that cadres engaging in production was "more harm than good." However, due to the timely and meticulous ideological work carried out on the cadres transferred to lower levels, helping them solve the actual problems existing in production and life, regularly summarizing experience, organizing comparisons, rewarding advanced elements, establishing banners, and encouraging backward elements to catch up with advanced elements, and patiently persuading and educating individuals who were not at ease with production. After this kind of meticulous ideological and political work, the political consciousness of the cadres transferred to lower levels was greatly improved, they further recognized the correctness of the Party's cadre policy, and felt that the Party's concern for them was meticulous. Therefore, the vast majority of people were full of enthusiasm and actively worked, and many people have planned to settle down in the countryside for a long time. The experience of Anhui also shows that strengthening the Party's political and ideological leadership is not only an extremely important task when cadres are transferred to lower levels, but also an important task throughout the entire process of participating in production labor. Therefore, Party organizations in various places should pay attention to effectively strengthening this aspect of work.

In the past few years, the number of cadres in the financial and trade departments in various places has increased a lot, and the situation of bloated institutions and overstaffing is quite serious. At present, a large number of cadres in the national financial and trade system have been transferred to lower levels to participate in production labor, and more people will step onto the production front in the future. The successful experience of cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade system in participating in production labor has found a way for financial and trade departments to improve their own business work and better serve production and consumption. Other places can apply it in combination with their local actual conditions. The labor enthusiasm and the indomitable spirit of overcoming difficulties of the cadres transferred to lower levels in the Anhui Province financial and trade department are worthy of learning by all cadres transferred to lower levels. All cadres transferred to lower levels should be determined to unite and become one with farmers and workers in labor, humbly learn from the working people, and give full play to their knowledge and talents, so that they can become both "red" and "expert", and better contribute their strength to building socialism.

### 在又红又专的道路上

    在又红又专的道路上
    毛泽东同志在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中曾经指出：“在我们的许多工作人员中间，现在滋长着一种不愿意和群众同甘苦，喜欢计较个人名利的危险倾向，这是很不好的。我们在增产节约运动中要求精简机关，下放干部，使相当大的一批干部回到生产中去，就是克服这种危险倾向的一个方法。”5月5日在北京开幕的安徽省财贸系统下放干部生产成果展览会所展出的下放干部在劳动生产和政治思想方面获得的丰硕成果，雄辩地证明了毛泽东同志这一论断的英明和正确。
    下放干部到生产中去劳动锻炼，加强生产战线，是党的一项重要的革命措施，是党的干部路线的一个重要方面，是这次整风运动的一项重要内容，是政治战线和思想战线上社会主义革命的一个重要组成部分。在前一个时期，在我们的许多工作人员中间，特别是在一些没有经过生产劳动锻炼和实际斗争考验的青年知识分子干部中间，曾经滋长着一种只能为“官”，不能为“民”的错误思想倾向。要他们到生产中去劳动锻炼，就感到有伤体面，大材小用，没有前途，怀疑多端，顾虑重重。这些顾虑实质上是一种剥削阶级轻视劳动、轻视工农的思想反映。安徽省财贸系统下放干部用自己亲身的体验，用一年中在思想上、生产上所取得的成果，彻底批驳了上述种种不正确的看法和顾虑。
    安徽省是下放干部工作做得最早的一个省，他们从去年2月就开始大批下放干部到工农业劳动战线上去。开始，干部中间也有很多顾虑，但经过思想斗争，经过说服教育，觉悟提高了，信心增强了，情况于是大变，人员从减不下来到可以减一点，到可以大减；从不好安排到可以安排，到大有办法。几个月的时间内，全省仅财贸系统就下放了三万多人，今年还准备再减二万五千人。下放干部经过一年的生产劳动实践，精神面貌和思想状况都起了深刻的变化。有些原先认为参加生产没有出息、没有前途的人，现在已经亲身体会到劳动的光荣和伟大，深切地认识到劳动创造一切的实际意义，从把参加劳动锻炼视为畏途转变到积极地从事生产劳动。这就解决了这样一个问题，不只是在口头上，而是在实际行动上把自己当作普通劳动人民的一分子，置身于劳动人民当中了。剥削阶级遗留下来的“学而优则仕”的鄙视劳动的观念已经被打破，共产主义思想正在成长。这是一个有伟大意义的变革。许多人过去是肩不能挑担，手不能提篮的“书生”，现在已经掌握了一些生产技术。有些人已经成为生产能手和劳动模范，有的还创造了许多新的技术和经验，大大地提高了生产效率。那些认为下放干部能红不能专的论点，在事实面前也被打破了。事实证明，只要肯为人民的事业尽心出力，虚心学习，刻苦钻研，就一定能够学到许多书本上学不到的宝贵知识，就能够在自己的岗位上成为内行。个人的钻研和社会主义事业的需要结合起来了。另外，大批干部下放参加生产劳动，在广大劳动群众中间发生了重大的影响，社会风气有了很大变化。下乡上山正成为社会风气。那些过去不安心农村工作的人现在也安心了。有些下放干部在向农民学习生产知识和技能的同时，还积极地帮助农民提高生产技术和文化水平，不仅对促进当地工业和农业的发展起了良好的作用，也大大密切了党和群众的联系。所有这些，都有力地证明了党的下放干部政策是一个完全正确的政策。
    下放干部参加生产的门路是多方面的。到农业社去与农民同吃、同住、同劳动，向农民学习又给农民以帮助，这是在目前条件下下放干部的一个重要方面。这不仅是为了便于使干部和广大农民群众建立起密切的联系，同时因为当前农业生产发展的状况要求有一批干部去支持农业生产大跃进。但在条件许可、事业发展需要的情况下，也可以组织下放干部开办工厂、农场，集体进行生产。这同样可以达到锻炼和改造干部的目的，对促进生产的发展，也有重大的作用。安徽省财贸系统下放干部除了参加农业合作社进行生产劳动以外，还根据投资少、收效快、不与民争利，与本部门业务相结合的方针，举办了三百八十多个生产企业，总共投资只有七百八十万元，到去年年底就创造了财富二千三百多万元。实践证明，这些方针是正确的。供销社系统筹办的很多生产单位，都是用自己收购的农副产品和废料废物进行生产的。商业系统开办的一些小型日用杂品加工厂生产的纽扣、丝绸、藕粉等等，也都是就地取材、就地加工的。这样做的结果，不但发展了地方工业而且也有力地推动了供销系统本身业务的开展，更好地为农村服务。
    把下放干部的生产组织好，使他们在劳动中充分的发挥作用，作出成绩，改变自己的精神面貌，最重要、最根本性的问题是加强党的政治思想领导。安徽的经验也生动地证明了这一点。安徽省财贸系统下放干部中原来也有不少人不愿劳动或是轻视劳动，认为干部搞生产是“得不偿失”。但是，由于及时地对下放干部进行了细致的思想工作，帮助他们解决生产上和生活上实际存在的问题，定期总结经验，组织评比，奖励先进，树立旗帜，鼓励落后的赶上先进，对于个别不安心生产的人，进行耐心地说服教育。经过了这种种细致的思想政治工作以后，下放干部的政治觉悟大为提高，进一步认识了党的干部政策的正确性，并且感到党对他们的关怀是无微不至的，因而绝大部分人情绪饱满，劳动积极，不少人已经打算在农村长期安家落户。安徽的经验还说明：加强党的政治思想领导，不仅在干部下放时是一项极端重要的工作，在干部下放以后，在整个参加生产劳动的过程中，都是一项重要工作。因此，各地党的组织应该注意切实加强这方面的工作。
    几年来，各地财贸部门的干部增加很多，机构臃肿、人浮于事的情况相当严重。目前全国财贸系统已有大批干部下放参加了生产劳动，今后还将有更多的人走上生产战线。安徽省财贸系统下放干部参加生产劳动所取得的成功经验，为财贸部门如何改进本身的业务工作，如何更好地为生产、为消费服务，摸出了一条道路，其他地方可以结合本地的实际情况加以运用。而安徽省财贸部门下放干部的劳动热情、克服困难的顽强精神，是值得所有下放干部学习的。全体下放干部，都应该下定决心，在劳动中同农民、工人结成一体，打成一片，虚心向劳动人民学习，充分发挥自己的知识和才干，使自己红透专深，更好地为建设社会主义贡献出自己的力量。
