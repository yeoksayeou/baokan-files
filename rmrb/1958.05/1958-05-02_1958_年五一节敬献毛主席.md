    Dedication to Chairman Mao on May Day 1958
    Huang Yanpei

    Dedication speech at the unveiling of the Monument to the People's Heroes
    Ten years since liberation. Heroes rest in peace underground.
    Workers and peasants leap forward in new production. The East is Red song resounds across the sky.
    The world situation is changing significantly. Heroes rest in peace underground.
    The East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Another satellite is about to ascend to the heavens.
    (AFP Warsaw dispatch: The Soviet Union's third artificial satellite will be launched)

    A gift to the Yao Chen Agricultural Cooperative in the suburban district of Nanjing
    Lovely Yao Chen,
    Delightful Yao Xin,
    October Cooperative is its predecessor.
    (The "October Cooperative" visited by Chairman Mao has now developed into three cooperatives: "Yao Chen," "Xin He," and "Wu Long." On the day we visited Yao Chen Cooperative, they were celebrating the establishment of a nursery and a kindergarten, and requested a name to be inscribed, so it was named "Yao Xin.")
    The mountains, high and low, are all green,
    The sound of flowing water can be heard everywhere in the field ditches.
    (Over seventeen reservoirs with over 10,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been built on the mountain slopes. The fields are all irrigated.)
    Sisters and brothers!
    Children!
    I will report back to Chairman Mao:
    They are forever reminiscing and excited,
    They are willing to contribute all their strength,
    To commemorate the Chairman's visit.
    Sisters and brothers!
    Children!
    I will report to Chairman Mao:
    We have seen:
    Every child is happy,
    Peach and plum trees provide shade in every village.
    (All school-age children in the cooperative attend school, and a junior agricultural middle school has also been established. The cooperative is in a mountainous area. Many fruit trees are planted.)

    1958年五一节敬献毛主席
    黄炎培
    人民英雄纪念碑揭幕献词
    解放于今且十年。英雄地下慰长眠。
    工农跃进新生产。唱彻东方红沸天。
    世局翻新已显然。英雄地下慰长眠。
    东风早压西风倒。又一卫星将上天。
    （法新社华沙电苏联第三个人造卫星将发射）
    赠南京市郊区尧辰农业合作社
    可爱的尧辰，
    可喜的尧新，
    十月社是它的前身。
    （毛主席到临过的“十月社”现发展为“尧辰”、“新合”、“五龙”三社。我们到尧辰社那天，正报喜创立了一个托儿所、一个幼儿班，要求题名，题名“尧新”。）
    高高低低的山都绿化了，
    田沟里到处听到流水的声音。
      （就山坡高地建了一万土方以上的水库十七个。田田得水。）
    姊妹弟兄们！
    小朋友们！
    我将回去报告毛主席：
    他们永远在回想、在兴奋，
    他们愿贡献一切力量，
    来纪念主席的到临。
    姊妹弟兄们！
    小朋友们！
    我将报告主席：
    我们看到了：
    个个儿童幸福，
    村村桃李成荫。
    （社学龄儿童全上学，还办了初级农业中学。社是山区。种果树特别多。）
