    The Hopes of Overseas Chinese Students
    I am an overseas Chinese student. Every day when I open the People’s Daily, I always want to see articles about returned overseas Chinese, relatives of overseas Chinese, and overseas Chinese students. But, to my disappointment, there are very few such reports. Now, returned overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese students all over the country are in the midst of the Great Leap Forward, and many inspiring new phenomena are worth praising and reporting. Therefore, I hope that more articles in this regard can be published, so that returned overseas Chinese and the people of the whole country can receive greater education from them and leap forward together.

    侨生的希望
    我是华侨学生。每天当我翻开人民日报时，总想看看有关归侨、侨眷、侨生情况的文章。可是，很使我失望，这类报道极少。现在全国各地的归侨、侨生都在大跃进中，许多令人振奋的新气象是值得歌颂和报道的。因此，我希望能多登些这方面的文章，使归侨和全国人民从中得到更大的教育，一齐跃进。
