Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 25th: Miao farmers in southeastern Guizhou Province are achieving great success using "Bird Kings" to lure and annihilate sparrows and other harmful birds. The "Bird King" is a male bird, only the size of a thumb, with brownish-yellow feathers and a melodious song. This bird, called "Jiao Zai Que" in the Miao language, can be trained in a short period of time to summon flocks of sparrows.

The Miao-Dong Autonomous Prefecture of Southeastern Guizhou has many mountains and many sparrows. Every year, a large amount of grain is ruined by harmful birds, so Miao farmers in the mountainous areas generally use this method to catch and kill them. This year, in the movement to eliminate the four pests, some Miao farmers in the region adopted the traditional method of using "Bird Kings" to lure and capture harmful birds. Before dawn, as long as it wasn't raining, they would place the trained "Bird King" on a hillside or mountain hollow frequented by sparrows. Around the "Bird King," they planted many fake trees, smeared the branches with a very sticky tung oil paste, and set up a "bird pond." People hid in disguised shacks by the bird pond to direct the "Bird King." When the "Bird King" called, flocks of sparrows flew in from all directions like a gale. At this time, the hunter would direct the "Bird King" to stop calling, causing the arriving sparrows to land in search of the "Bird King." As long as the sparrows landed on the sticky branches, they could be caught easily.

    贵州苗族山区采用诱捕灭雀法
    当“鸟王”一叫，麻雀像刮风一样飞来
    据新华社贵阳25日电　贵州省东南部苗族农民利用“鸟王”诱歼麻雀及其它害鸟很有成绩。“鸟王”是一种只有拇指大的雄鸟，色黄褐，叫声婉转动听。这种鸟在苗语中叫“狡崽雀”，经过短期训练就可以用来召唤雀群。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州山多，麻雀也多，每年都有大量粮食被害鸟糟蹋，所以山区苗族农民一般采用这个办法捕杀害鸟。今年这个地区在除四害运动中，有一部分苗族农民采用了传统的用“鸟王”诱捕害鸟的办法。他们在天亮前，只要不下雨，就把经过训练的“鸟王”放在麻雀常到的山坡或山坳上。在“鸟王”的周围栽上许多假树，在树枝上涂抹一种粘性很强的桐油膏，布置成“鸟塘”，人躲在鸟塘边伪装的小棚里指挥“鸟王”。当“鸟王”一叫唤，成群的麻雀像刮风一样从四面八方飞来。这时猎手又指挥“鸟王”停止叫，使飞来的麻雀纷纷落下寻找“鸟王”。只要麻雀停落在粘膏枝上，就可以随手捕捉了。
