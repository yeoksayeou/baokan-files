Select the Best Boiler-Traction Engine

Factories large and small throughout the country are producing their own new products every day. Some of these are entirely new, some are improvements on the original, and some are already outdated. This situation is normal. The problem now is that factories should exchange experiences with each other, learn from each other's strengths, and especially for general-purpose products, the best should be selected from the products of various places and factories, and finalized to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. If this work is done too early or too strictly, it will stifle everyone's creativity; if it is too late or too loose, it will also cause waste. It must be done appropriately and at the right time. Judging from the current situation, the finalization of the boiler-traction engine seems to be somewhat late and should be grasped immediately.

Since the upsurge in farmland irrigation construction, the number of factories manufacturing boiler-traction engines has increased a lot. Taking Henan Province as an example, there were only two factories manufacturing boiler-traction engines. During the upsurge, more than twenty factories also trial-produced and produced boiler-traction engines.

Because the drawings of each factory come from different sources, and the structure has been modified to a certain extent, the performance and efficiency are not the same. The most significant difference is the average weight per horsepower of the boiler-traction engine. For example, the Beijing Universal Machinery Factory weighs only 40 kilograms per horsepower; while the Shijiazhuang Machinery Factory weighs 70 kilograms per horsepower; the Shenyang Machinery Factory weighs 120 kilograms per horsepower; and the Zhengzhou Machinery Factory weighs as much as 180 kilograms per horsepower. Although the horsepower is different, the average weight should also be different, but the metal material consumption quota should not differ so much!

In order to make the boiler-traction engine easier to move, many factories are trying to change it from vertical to horizontal. This direction is undeniable. The question is how to change it reasonably. We saw a horizontal boiler-traction engine being trial-produced by the Luoyang Machine Tool Repair Factory, equipped with two pairs of car tires and a transmission system, which can walk and tow, equivalent to a steam tractor. This is not only technically unreasonable, but also economically very uneconomical. This will inevitably greatly increase costs and be unpopular with farmers.

All of this not only shows the importance of finalizing the boiler-traction engine, but also that time should be seized.

However, some people think that the boiler-traction engine is bulky, consumes metal, and consumes fuel, and is not a development direction; therefore, it is not worth spending technical resources. This view is wrong. Although the boiler-traction engine has the above shortcomings, it is easy to manufacture and easy to use. For a certain period of time, it is still one of the main power machines in my country's rural areas.

Some people will also think that the boiler-traction engine is a local product and is being produced everywhere. The finalization work will be managed by the provinces, cities, and counties themselves, so why should the central government grasp it. In the provinces and cities, some people will think that anyway, other provinces are also producing it, so let's see what they do first. In this way, if you wait for me and I wait for you, the finalization work will be delayed, causing waste. In fact, for the selection and finalization of similar general-purpose products nationwide, the provinces and cities should grasp it, and the relevant departments of the central government should also grasp it. It is hoped that the relevant departments of the central government will work with the provinces and cities to finalize the type of boiler-traction engine as soon as possible.

The boiler-traction engine is only one of the types that need to be finalized quickly. The selection and finalization of other types, such as gas engines and tractors, should also be followed up in a timely manner.

    选出最好的锅驼机
    有萱
    全国各地大大小小的工厂，天天在生产着各自的新产品。其中有的完全是新的，有的比原来有了改进，也有的已经落后了。这种情况是正常的。现在的问题在于：应当在厂和厂之间互相交流经验、取长补短，特别是通用的产品，应当从各地、各厂的产品中选出好的，加以定型，做到更加多快好省。这一工作做得过早过严，就会束缚大家的创造性；过迟过松，也会造成浪费，必须恰如其分，适得其时。就目前情况看来，锅驼机的定型工作似乎已经有些迟了，应当马上抓起来。
    兴修农田水利的高潮起来以后，制造锅驼机的工厂增加很多。以河南省为例，制造锅驼机的工厂原来只有两个，高潮中又有二十多个工厂试制和生产锅驼机。
    由于各厂图纸的来源不一，结构上又各自作了一定的修改，因而性能、效率也不尽相同。其中差别最显著的要算锅驼机每马力的平均重量。如：北京通用机器厂每马力重仅四十多公斤；而石家庄机械厂每马力重七十公斤；沈阳机械厂每马力重一百二十公斤；郑州机械厂则每马力重达一百八十公斤。虽然马力不同，平均重量也应当有所不同，但金属材料消耗定额也不应相差如此之远！
    为使锅驼机便于移动，许多工厂正尝试把它由立式改为卧式。这个方向是无可非议的。问题在于怎样才改得合理。我们看到洛阳机具修理厂正在试制的一台卧式锅驼机，装了两对汽车轮胎，还配上一套传动系统，能走，能拖，相当于一台蒸汽拖拉机。这不但在技术上不合理，就是在经济上也是极不合算的。这样，势必大大增加成本，不受农民欢迎。
    所有这些，不仅说明锅驼机的定型工作重要，而且应当抓紧时间。
    但是，会有人认为：锅驼机笨重、费金属、费燃料，不是发展方向；因而不值得花费技术力量。这种看法是不对的。锅驼机虽有上述缺点，但它制造容易，使用方便，在一定时期内，它还是我国农村主要动力机械之一。
    又会有人认为：锅驼机是地方产品，到处在生产，定型工作各省、市、县自己会管，中央何必抓它。而在各省市，又会有人认为：反正别省也在生产，看人家怎么办再说。这样，你等我，我等你，就会把定型工作拖下去，造成浪费。其实，类似这样通用全国的产品的选型和定型工作，各省市要抓，中央有关部门也要抓，希望中央有关部门会同省市，尽快把锅驼机的型式定下来。
    锅驼机仅仅是需要快抓定型工作中的一种，其它如煤气机、拖拉机等的选型和定型工作，也应当及时跟上去。
