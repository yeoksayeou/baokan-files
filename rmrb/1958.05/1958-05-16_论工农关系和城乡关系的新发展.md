　　On the New Development of the Worker-Peasant Relationship and the Urban-Rural Relationship
　　Tao Lujia, First Secretary of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

　　Socialist Collaboration Replaces the Relationship of "Visiting Relatives"

　　The current worker-peasant relationship and urban-rural relationship in our country are based on the socialist system of public ownership and are a relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation under the leadership of the working class (referring to economic relations). In Shanxi, people's understanding of this concept in the past was relatively abstract. The impression of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship seemed to be only the annual Lantern Festival, when workers sent representatives to the countryside, and farmers sent representatives to the city to hold an annual worker-peasant get-together, visiting each other. This was the relationship that the masses called "visiting relatives." However, the situation is very different now. As long as you go to the countryside or any small or medium-sized city, you can feel that the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship have many new and vivid contents. These contents show that after the land reform movement and the socialist revolution movement brought about fundamental changes, the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship have entered a new stage of development.

　　Since the upsurge of the great leap forward in agriculture in the winter of last year, the National Agricultural Development Program has truly become the goal of the people. Not only farmers and rural people are working selflessly to achieve this goal as soon as possible, but also workers and urban people have shown unprecedented enthusiasm and a sense of responsibility to support the great leap forward in agriculture. Taking Qin County as an example, among all workers, business personnel, teachers, students, doctors, and state workers in the county town, there is a deeply rooted slogan called "Thousands of hearts, ten thousand hearts, all for four hundred catties." This slogan is not just an empty call, but an action slogan for all of them to achieve the target of 400 catties of grain per mu as stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program nine years ahead of schedule. They—especially the workers—all contribute their greatest strength to support agriculture to the best of their ability and in every possible way. The county-run joint factory has close ties with all agricultural cooperatives in the county and has made outstanding achievements in supplying, repairing, and creating new agricultural tools and machinery, manufacturing fertilizers, and processing agricultural products, so it is praised by the farmers of the county as "Wan Bao Quan" (all-purpose treasure). In the past, farmers called workers "elder brothers" only verbally, but they were not convinced in their hearts. Now, the working class in their eyes is no longer a leading class with question marks; in the past, farmers regarded the shops in the county town as "official merchants," but now they praise the department store as "Bai Bao Quan" (hundred-treasure) the younger brother of "Wan Bao Quan." In the past, farmers regarded cadres from the city as officials, but now they say that "Old Eighth Route Army" is back. All this shows that due to the promotion of the agricultural upsurge, the mutual promotion role of agriculture and industry, farmers and workers, rural and urban areas has been brought into play, and the leading role of the working class to the peasants and the city to the countryside has been strengthened. The original "city walls" between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas have been demolished, and the original "city moats" have also been filled.

　　A prominent feature of the industrial construction upsurge promoted by the agricultural construction upsurge is that the whole party and the whole people are engaged in industry, and industry is run in combination with workers and peasants and in combination with urban and rural areas. Since February this year, we have used the experience of Qin County's county, township, and commune-run industries as a typical example and held an on-site meeting on local industrial work throughout the province. Only three months have passed, and the experience of Qin County has spread rapidly throughout the province like a spark. According to the latest statistics, it is expected that more than 13,000 new large, medium, and small factories will be built throughout the province this year, and more than 90% of them are small factories run by counties, townships, and communes, of which more than 2,000 factories have been completed and put into production. The industrial construction funds raised by the province itself have reached 210 million yuan, of which more than 90 million yuan is invested by the masses and cadres. It is estimated that the total output value of local industry in the province this year will increase by 80% compared with 1957. Such a high speed and such a large scale were not originally anticipated by us. The emergence of this new situation fully shows that the slogan of realizing industrialization and "catching up with Britain in fifteen years" is not only a battle slogan of the working class, but also a battle slogan of the whole people because farmers are also contributing money and efforts to run industry in a big way.

　　In the past few years, we have done some work in organizing socialist cooperation between urban and rural areas. However, at that time, the scale of cooperation was small, the content of cooperation was scattered and intermittent, and the purpose of cooperation was only focused on solving the practical problems of non-staple food and labor required by the city. In the past few months, this cooperative relationship has undergone great changes. The scope of cooperation covers the entire province; the purpose of cooperation is to promote the comprehensive leap forward of industries including industry and agriculture, transportation, commerce, culture, education, health, science and technology, etc., with industry and agriculture as the center; the content of cooperation is rich and colorful, and more emphasis is placed on workers supporting peasants, industry supporting agriculture, and cities supporting rural areas; the forms of cooperation are also diverse and blooming. The province divides six urban-rural cooperation zones with cities as the center. Various places also organize many small urban-rural cooperation zones crisscrossing between counties with larger county towns as the center. Within the scope of each county, large and small urban-rural cooperation zones are also organized with county towns and market towns as the center. To give an example, not long ago, Taiyuan City and eighteen counties held a cooperation meeting. Through this meeting, they formulated a preliminary plan for mutual cooperation and development of industry and agriculture. According to this plan, Taiyuan City will help eighteen counties build or expand a large number of small and medium-sized factories and mines in three to five years, so that these counties will initially realize agricultural mechanization and rural electrification. This year, they will assist various counties in building and expanding 167 factories (104 more than the original plan of the Provincial Department of Industry and the eighteen counties), including 18 agricultural machinery repair and assembly plants and cement plants, 46 iron smelting plants, 4 lead and zinc smelting plants, sulfur plants, and thermal power plants, 16 coking plants, 13 steel plants and coal mines, 1 manganese smelting plant, nickel smelting plant, refractory material plant, and gypsum plant, 3 nitrogen fertilizer plants and machine-made paper mills, 5 asbestos plants, 8 starch plants, 2 gold mines, and 6 substations. Among them, the new enterprises that mainly produce various metal raw materials for large factories in Taiyuan City are invested by Taiyuan City with 10 to 15 million yuan. In order to accelerate the construction of the above-mentioned factories and mines, the major factories and mines in Taiyuan City have decided to provide 125 machine tools and motor equipment that they do not use to the counties. According to this plan, Taiyuan City will organize three comprehensive teams including various types of technical personnel from now on, go to various counties to help conduct resource surveys and plan local industries, help various counties train the technical force required by county-run enterprises, and help various counties gradually establish survey teams and construction teams. According to this plan, the eighteen counties have become the base for supplying Taiyuan City with the non-staple food it needs, and at the same time, it is also the base for providing labor to ensure the industrial development needs of Taiyuan City. In addition, Taiyuan City also requires each county to collect 10 to 30 tons of scrap copper and rotten iron this year for the needs of heavy industrial factories in the city. The comrades who participated in this cooperation meeting from various counties said afterwards: "I really did not expect that 150,000 eggs, 5 million catties of vegetables, and a pile of scrap copper and rotten iron would be exchanged for the socialist industrialization of the countryside. This kind of urban-rural relationship is really unprecedented." In addition to Taiyuan City, Datong, Changzhi, Yangquan and other cities, as well as other county towns and industrial and mining areas, have also done the same thing in general. It can be seen that socialist cooperation between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas has replaced the small cooperation that was deserted in the past.

　　The above three aspects of the situation are encouraging new developments in the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas. There is no doubt that this new development proves the correctness of the line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results creatively proposed by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong. This new development will inevitably lead to a more consolidated worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class.

　　The New Relationship is Produced on the Basis of the Victory of the Rectification Campaign and the Anti-Rightist Struggle

　　The emergence of the new situation in the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship is not accidental, but the result of a series of struggles.

　　First of all, the first deadly enemy we encountered in the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas was the bourgeois rightists. When they launched a frantic attack on our party, on socialism, and on the working class, they maliciously spread rumors such as "workers live too well, farmers live too poorly," "urban industrialization, rural impoverishment," etc., using individual shortcomings in our work. Their attempt was to provoke the opposition between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, to negate the superiority of agricultural cooperation, and to negate the necessity of socialist industrialization, so as to achieve the purpose of abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat and restoring capitalism. The poison they spread once temporarily confused some people with weak will. But after the anti-rightist struggle and the nationwide debate on the "two roads," people saw through the ugly faces of the rightists, drew a line between the socialist road and the capitalist road, and made it clear that the shortcomings in our work were only a matter of one finger out of ten fingers. In this way, a small handful of rightists were completely isolated. Obviously, if we had not won the victory in the anti-rightist struggle, the new development of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship would have been unthinkable.

　　Secondly, through the nationwide rectification movement, the second obstacle lying in the way of the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas was revealed, which was the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of the upper-level petty bourgeoisie, small merchants and peddlers in the cities and the well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside. We have widely mobilized the masses to conduct special topic airing of views and debates on the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship. From the airing of views materials, it can be seen that the urban and rural capitalist spontaneous forces tried every means to take advantage of socialism and drag socialism back. It is enough to give an example. Not long ago, Qiao Jinhai and his three brothers (well-to-do middle peasants), members of the Hongfei Agricultural Cooperative in Hongzhao County, Fengzhang Township, openly instigated the masses to make trouble for food, and took the opportunity to provoke the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship. When the masses refused to listen to them, they went to the county and province to file complaints. Finally, the masses could not bear it anymore and carried out a sharp debate with them, and checked out more than 15,000 catties of surplus grain, 3,900 catties of oil, 300 catties of lint cotton, and 3,200 catties of seed cotton from their homes. Such examples are not isolated. Since October last year, in the rural rectification movement in our province, the masses have posted more than 100 million big-character posters. Among them, about one-third are to expose and criticize the capitalist ideology of well-to-do middle peasants. For the upper-level petty bourgeoisie and small merchants and peddlers in the cities, their capitalist ideology was also exposed and criticized through the rectification movement. At the same time, the petty-bourgeois ideology of some people in the working masses who struggled for "Renminbi" was also criticized. Not only that, but on the basis of ideological criticism, socialist public ownership was further consolidated and expanded in both urban and rural areas. After the rectification, most of the well-to-do middle peasants who were originally wavering are now leaning towards the Party and socialism. Of course, a small number of them are still waiting and watching to see how the agricultural leap forward will go this year. Small merchants and peddlers in the cities and some scattered upper-level petty-bourgeois elements have also been further organized into the socialist channel. Obviously, if we do not firmly fight against the capitalist spontaneous forces through the nationwide rectification movement and allow them to spread freely, if we do not resolutely consolidate and expand socialist public ownership and remove the roots of capitalism, then the new development of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship is also unthinkable.

　　The third obstacle encountered in the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas is the right-leaning conservative thinking of some comrades in our party. This kind of thinking is inseparable from the ideological methods of dogmatism and empiricism. On the issue of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and implementing the policy of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, dogmatists inappropriately emphasize giving priority to the development of heavy industry, as if they believe that heavy industry can develop in isolation from agriculture. Therefore, they are not enthusiastic about the National Agricultural Development Program, about industrial support for agriculture, and about urban support for rural areas. The empiricists, on the other hand, are filled with the historical situation of the backward small-scale peasant economy. They pay attention to agriculture but do not believe that agriculture can make a great leap forward. They are afraid of the tension between the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship that may be caused by the backwardness of agriculture, but they are unwilling to actively find a way out from the development of production, and are always circling around the financial problem and the distribution problem. They forget that in the three things of production, finance, and distribution, the decisive role is played by production. Only by speeding up the development of industrial and agricultural production and construction can the terrible tension be avoided. They do not see the possibility of high-speed development of both industry and agriculture at the same time, but advocate the priority of agriculture over industry, and advocate the complete leveling of workers' and peasants' lives and urban and rural lives. Because of this, they are not enthusiastic about industrialization, about rural support for cities, and about agricultural support for industry. In this way, it seems that dogmatists and empiricists are going to extremes in the relationship between workers and peasants, industry and agriculture, cities and villages. In fact, their ideological methods have a common feature in the final analysis, that is, they exaggerate the contradictory aspect of these three pairs of relationships as the main aspect, and reduce the unity aspect to a secondary aspect or completely deny it. This one-sided ideological method makes them unable to see that under the socialist system in our country, the common interests of both sides of these three pairs of relationships in various fundamental issues are the main ones, and the mutual contradictions in their current specific interests do exist and will often exist, but they only occupy a secondary position. Because of this, dogmatists and empiricists can only walk on one leg (either the left leg or the right leg) in construction, but not on two legs. This cannot but make them fall into the quagmire of right-leaning conservatism and cannot understand the far-reaching significance of the Party's general policy and general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results for promoting the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas. Obviously, if we do not carry out a struggle against right-leaning conservative thinking, dogmatic thinking, and empirical thinking through the rectification of the party, then we cannot smoothly implement the Party's general policy and general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economical results. The new development of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship is also unthinkable.

　　Create Conditions for Eliminating the Essential Differences between the Worker-Peasant Relationship and the Urban-Rural Relationship

　　The development prospect of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship is the disappearance of the essential differences between workers and peasants, cities and villages. Of course, this is a long-term development process. However, in the current transition period, it is necessary for us to have such ideological preparation and to create spiritual and material conditions for it in practical work step by step. If it is said that in the past democratic revolution stage there were socialist revolutionary factors and sprouts, then in the current transition period, communist stage factors and sprouts will inevitably appear, and these factors and sprouts have begun to appear in the movement of urban and rural socialist cooperation. We should pay attention to it and cherish it. We should, in the spirit of looking far ahead and starting from the near future, make the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship continue to move forward.

　　The worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship, like other aspects of the relations of production, must meet the needs of the development of social productive forces. Practice in the past six months has proved that in order to accelerate the forward development of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship, the first thing to pay attention to is the production and construction of industry and agriculture. The fact is that we first seized the great leap forward of industry and agriculture, and strived to achieve the tasks stipulated in the National Agricultural Development Program in five years or more, and at the same time, strived to make the total output value of local industry reach 60% to 70% of the total output value of industry and agriculture in five years, and initially realize agricultural mechanization and rural electrification. In this way, some new problems have been put forward for the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship, and the solution of these problems not only promotes the development of social productive forces, but also changes the face of the worker-peasant relationship and the urban-rural relationship itself.

　　(1) The proportion between heavy industry and light industry. This problem is related to the proportional relationship between the increased production of grain and the increased production of raw materials for light industry in agriculture. Agriculture has not only a promoting effect on the development of industry, but also a restrictive effect. The problem now is that on the one hand, agricultural cooperatives are eager to solve the shortage of grain and are unwilling to expand the planting area of economic crops, which will inevitably affect the development of light industry. On the other hand, agricultural cooperatives urgently require heavy industry to provide more and faster machines, electricity, chemical fertilizers, etc. However, if heavy industry is too fast and light industry is too slow, it will not be conducive to the accumulation of industrial construction funds, nor will it be conducive to stimulating the faster development of agriculture. Therefore, rationally arranging the proportion of heavy industry and light industry, food crops and economic crops, and making the supply, production, and sales relations between heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture have a general comprehensive balance according to the national situation and the provincial situation, is an important key to making industry and agriculture develop simultaneously and urban and rural areas prosper together. According to the specific conditions of our province, in the current three-year period of hard work, the speed of development of heavy industry may and needs to be faster than the last two years of the second five-year plan, while light industry is the opposite. However, considering the conditions that abundant wild plant resources can be used as raw materials for light industry, we will strive to control the ratio of light and heavy industry to 4:6 or half-and-half in five years, which is necessary and possible.

　　(2) The rise of small and medium-sized industrial cities and the labor policy. As a result of the whole party and the whole people running industry, the current county towns and market towns will gradually develop into small and medium-sized industrial cities. Along the direction of narrowing the gap between urban and rural areas, we have formulated a long-term plan for the development of small and medium-sized industrial cities for five to ten years. The main problem encountered here is that the simultaneous leap forward of industry and agriculture has caused a tense situation in the competition for labor between urban and rural areas. This situation has already occurred this year. From the current situation that the utilization rate of existing labor force in rural and urban areas has not yet been fully exploited, as long as we take measures such as streamlining personnel who are separated from production, adjusting labor organizations, implementing technological reforms, advocating "one person is proficient in many skills, one machine (machine) has multiple uses," and mutual adjustment among units, the utilization rate of labor force can be increased several times or even more than ten times. However, from a long-term perspective, due to the rapid development of industry, these measures alone cannot completely solve the problem. The way out is to build more small and medium-sized enterprises, especially small enterprises, in small and medium-sized cities where raw materials for light and heavy industry are produced. This not only makes the combination of supply, production, and sales better, but also makes it easy to flexibly use rural labor and other non-professional workers according to the amount of work. In the future, enterprises at the county level and below should use fewer fixed workers and more long-term contract workers and temporary workers, and implement the policy of "both workers and farmers." According to our experience, this policy can also be appropriately promoted in large enterprises, especially in the construction industry and coal mines. To this end, the pre-worker system should be universally implemented in agricultural cooperatives, that is, agricultural cooperatives should determine a percentage of full labor force as pre-workers when carrying out labor planning, and this pre-worker system should be unified with all urban and rural economic cooperation zones in the province. The implementation of the policy of both workers and farmers and the pre-worker system must have a new labor and wage system. We have already drafted such a labor and wage system and are conducting typical experiments in five counties. We believe that the slogan "Work to catch up with the advanced, life to look at the peasants" put forward by the workers of the Huaihai Machinery Factory in Changzhi City should become the slogan of all workers.

　　(3) The relationship between production, accumulation, and consumption. In the situation of a comprehensive leap forward, it is inevitable that there will be imbalances between these three. But as long as we firmly grasp the central link of production, there is no need to be afraid. Of course, we must pay attention to timely discovering and adjusting the imbalances that have already emerged and appeared. Otherwise, it will have an adverse impact on production and the lives of workers, peasants, urban and rural areas. We should pay attention to making appropriate adjustments to the differences in the lives of workers, peasants, urban and rural areas, and avoid unreasonably large differences. Certain reasonable differences are necessary. For the proportion between public accumulation and personal consumption of agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives, with the leap forward of production, the proportion of public accumulation should be increased in order to purchase a large number of means of production and promote the development of heavy industry and the development of agriculture. But what is the appropriate height to increase to? Some people advocate that since we are going to work hard for three years, then the level of personal consumption should not be increased or even lowered somewhat within three years. If we do this according to this opinion, it will inevitably be unfavorable to the development of light industry and the adjustment of the lives of urban and rural people. Therefore, with the development of production, while increasing public accumulation, we must also make a certain increase in the level of personal consumption. In the three-year period of hard work, it can be increased less, and more later. In addition, there is also the problem of uneven production development. At present, the phenomenon of great disparity in wealth between agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives in various parts of our province is quite obvious. In some cooperatives with outstandingly rich public property and mass income, negative factors are growing among cadres and the masses, which is not conducive to the combination of workers and peasants and the combination of urban and rural areas. Although this phenomenon is still only a minority now, if it continues to develop, it can be imagined that there will still be a fierce struggle in the future when the transition from collective ownership to ownership by the whole people. In the current transition period, what we need to pay attention to is to make the development of industrial and agricultural production strive to achieve a general balance in regional distribution; for agricultural cooperatives and handicraft cooperatives to use mineral resources, forest resources and other natural resources, the state should formulate appropriate policies in a timely manner; we must flexibly use the policy of unified purchase and sales, the tax policy, and the price policy to regulate the contradiction between accumulation and consumption within the collective ownership economy, regulate the imbalance between the collective ownership economies of various regions, and regulate the contradiction between the two economies of collective ownership and ownership by the whole people.

　　Comrade Mao Zedong instructed us that "ideological work and political work are the soul and commander of all work." In order to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance under the leadership of the working class and develop the comradely mutual assistance and cooperation between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, we must, in accordance with this instruction of Comrade Mao Zedong, comprehensively and continuously strengthen the party's ideological work and political work. For the two exploiting classes that still exist, we have already carried out a series of struggles and transformation work on them in the past. In the future, we must continue to carry out the transformation work and necessary struggles against them. However, in the long period of time to come, the workload will be greater and more arduous for the ideological transformation of the original petty bourgeoisie in urban and rural areas, and especially for the ideological transformation of peasant small producers and well-to-do middle peasants. Because a large number of new workers in the working class are now peasants, and in the future, a large number of people who will flood into the working class are still peasants. How to strengthen the party's political and ideological work in the countryside on the basis of this nationwide rectification movement in order to consolidate and develop the results of the rectification is a problem that we must pay attention to. Now, we are promoting an effective experience created by Wanrong County in the rural areas of the province, which is called three schools, three loves, three diligent days, one department, and one room. Three schools—that is, each agricultural cooperative has a night party school, a night youth league school, and an amateur cultural and technical school. Three loves and three diligent days—that is, in accordance with the mass collective formulated three loves (love the country, love socialism, love the society) and three diligent (thrift and diligence in building the country, thrift and diligence in running the society, thrift and diligence in managing the family) conventions, there is a mass democratic life meeting led by the party branch in the club one day a month, with big-character posters, airing of views and debates. This is also a small rectification once a month. One department—that is, each society has a club as a public place for the masses to carry out cultural and artistic activities and learn scientific and technical knowledge. One room—that is, each society has an exhibition room. This set of methods, as long as it can be adhered to and implemented, can not only continuously improve the socialist consciousness of the masses, but also enable the contradictions among the people to be dealt with in a timely and correct manner. This experience can also be imitated in urban enterprises. In order to accelerate the narrowing of the gap between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas, while paying attention to strengthening political and ideological work, it is also necessary to vigorously carry out cultural revolution and technological revolution movements in rural areas. We emphasized in organizing urban-rural cooperation throughout the province that cities should give as much assistance as possible to rural areas in cultural revolution and technological revolution. Lenin said: "It takes several generations to transform small peasants and transform their entire psychology and habits. Only the material basis, only technology, only the large-scale use of tractors and machines in agriculture, only the large-scale implementation of electrification can solve this problem related to small peasants and make their entire psychology sound." It can be seen that combining the three factors of politics, culture, and technology and taking politics as the commander, promoting the leap forward of industry and agriculture again and again, and realizing the historical task of cultural revolution and technological revolution is the only way to accelerate the narrowing of the gap between workers and peasants and the gap between urban and rural areas.

　　论工农关系和城乡关系的新发展
　　中共山西省委第一书记　陶鲁笳
    社会主义大协作代替了“走亲戚”的关系
    我国现时的工农关系和城乡关系是建立在社会主义公有制基础上的、工人阶级领导的互助合作关系（指经济关系）。这个概念，在山西来说，人们过去对它的理解是比较抽象的，对于工农关系和城乡关系的印象似乎只是每年元宵节工人派代表下乡，农民派代表进城，举行一年一度的工农联欢，互相参观访问。这就是群众所说的“走亲戚”的关系。但是，现在情况大不相同了。只要到农村或者任何一个中小城市去看一下，就可以感觉到工农关系和城乡关系有了许多新的生动的内容。这些内容表明着：工农关系和城乡关系在经过了土地改革运动和社会主义革命运动而发生根本变化之后已经进到一个新的发展时期。
    自从去年冬季出现农业大跃进的高潮以来，全国农业发展纲要真正成为全民的奋斗目标了。不仅农民、乡下人为了提早实现这个目标，在忘我地苦战着，同时工人、城里人也都为支援农业大跃进而表现出从未有过的积极性和责任心。以沁县为例，在县城里所有工人、商业人员、教师、学生、医生、国家工作人员中，有一句深入人心的口号，叫做“千条心，万条心，一心为了四百斤”。这句口号，并不是空喊，而是他们大家为提前九年实现全国农业发展纲要规定的粮食亩产四百斤指标的行动口号。他们——特别是工人们都各尽所能、千方百计地为支援农业而贡献出自己的最大力量。县营联合工厂由于同全县农业社有密切联系，并且在供应、检修和创制新式农具、农业机械，制造肥料，农产品加工等方面做出了突出的成绩，所以被全县农民誉为“万宝全”。过去农民们称呼工人为老大哥只是嘴上叫，其实并不心服，现在他们眼光中的工人阶级却不再是打问号的领导阶级了；过去农民们把县城里的商店看作是“官商”，现在却称赞百货公司为“万宝全”的弟弟“百宝全”了。过去农民们把城里来的干部看作是官家人，现在却道是“老八路”又来了。所有这一切，说明：由于在农业高潮的推动下，发挥了农业和工业、农民和工人、农村和城市的相互的促进作用，加强了工人阶级对农民、城市对农村的领导作用，工农之间、城乡之间原来存在的“城墙”已经拆除了，原来存在的“城壕”也已经填平了。
    由农业建设高潮推动起来的工业建设高潮，一个显著的特点是全党全民动手办工业，工农结合、城乡结合办工业。自从今年二月间，我们以沁县的县、乡、社办工业的经验为典型，开了一次全省性的地方工业工作的现场会议，到现在，不过三个多月，沁县的经验，真像星星之火，飞快地燃遍了全省。据最近统计，预计在今年内全省新建大、中、小工厂将达到一万三千多个，百分之九十以上是县、乡、社办的小型工厂，其中有二千多个工厂已经建成并投入生产。全省自筹的工业建设资金已达二亿一千万元，其中，群众和干部投资即有九千多万元。预计今年全省地方工业的总产值将比一九五七年增长百分之八十。如此高的速度，如此大的规模，都是我们原来所没有预想到的。而这种新局面的出现充分说明：实现工业化和“十五年赶上英国”的口号，不单单是工人阶级的战斗口号，同时由于农民也在出钱、出力大办工业，所以它已经成为全民的战斗口号了。
    组织城乡之间的社会主义协作，在过去几年中，我们是做过一些工作的。但是，那时协作的规模是狭小的，协作的内容是零散的、时断时续的，协作的目的也只是偏重于解决城市所需要的副食品和劳动力等实际问题。在最近短短的几个月之内，这种协作关系大为改观了。协作的范围遍及全省；协作的目的，在于推动以工农业为中心的包括交通、商业、文化教育、卫生、科学技术等等事业的全面跃进；协作的内容丰富多采，而且更多地侧重于工人支援农民，工业支援农业，城市支援乡村；协作的形式，也是多种多样，百花齐放。全省以城市为中心，划分了六个城乡协作区。各地在县与县之间又以较大的县城为中心，纵横交错地组织了许多小的城乡协作区。在每个县的范围内，也以县城和集镇为中心，组织了大大小小的城乡协作区。举一个例子来说，不久以前，太原市和十八个县开了一次协作会议，通过这次会议，他们制订了一个相互协作发展工农业的初步规划。依照这个规划，太原市在三年到五年内，帮助十八个县新建或扩建一大批中小厂矿，使这些县初步地实现农业机械化、农村电力化。今年即协助各县新建、扩建工厂一百六十七个（这比省工业厅和十八个县原来计划新建、扩建的工厂多了一百零四个），包括有农业机械修配厂、水泥厂各十八个，炼铁厂四十六个，炼铅锌厂、硫磺厂、火力发电厂各四个，炼焦油厂十六个，炼钢厂、煤矿各十三个，炼锰厂、炼镍厂、耐火材料厂、石膏厂各一个，氮肥厂、机制纸厂各三个，石棉厂五个，淀粉厂八个，黄金开采二处，变电站六处。其中主要为太原市大工厂生产各种金属原料的新建企业，由太原市投资一千至一千五百万元。为了加速建设上述厂矿，太原市各大厂矿已决定拿出一百二十五台自己不用的机床和电机设备供给各县。依照这个规划，太原市从现在起，即组织包括有各类技术人员的三个综合小组，分头到各县帮助进行资源调查和地方工业的规划，帮助各县培养县营企业所需的技术力量，帮助各县逐步地建立勘察队伍和建筑队伍。依照这个规划，十八个县成为供应太原市所需副食品的基地，同时也是提供劳动力保证太原市工业发展需要的基地。此外，太原市还要求每个县在今年内要收集废铜烂铁十吨至三十吨，以供市内重工业工厂的需要。各县参加这次协作会议的同志，事后说道：“真没有想到，十五万个鸡蛋，五百万斤菜，一堆破铜烂铁，换来的是农村社会主义工业化。这种城乡关系真是亘古未有”。除了太原市以外，大同、长治、阳泉等市以及其他县城和工矿区也大体上都这样做了。由此可见，工农之间、城乡之间的社会主义大协作，已经代替了过去那种冷冷清清的小协作。
    以上所述三个方面的情况，就是工农结合、城乡结合的令人鼓舞的新的发展。毫无疑问，这种新的发展，证明了党中央和毛泽东同志创造性地提出的多快好省地建设社会主义路线的正确性。这种新的发展，必然导致工人阶级领导下的工农联盟的更加巩固。
    新关系是在整风反右派胜利的基础上产生的
    工农关系和城乡关系的新形势的出现，并不是偶然的，而是经过了一系列的斗争的结果。
    首先，我们在工农结合和城乡结合问题上，碰到的第一个死敌是资产阶级右派。他们在向我们党、向社会主义、向工人阶级发起猖狂进攻的时候，利用我们工作中的个别缺点，恶毒地散布什么“工人生活太好，农民生活太苦”，“城市工业化，农村贫困化”等等谰言。他们的企图是要挑起工农之间、城乡之间的对立，是要否定农业合作化的优越性，否定社会主义工业化的必要性，从而达到取消无产阶级专政，恢复资本主义的目的。他们所散布的这种毒素，曾经暂时地使一些意志薄弱的人受到迷惑。但是经过反右派斗争和全民性的“两条道路”的大辩论，人们识透了右派的丑恶面孔，划清了社会主义道路和资本主义道路的界限，辨明了我们工作中的缺点，不过是十个手指中的一个手指的问题。这样，一小撮右派分子就彻底地孤立起来了。很显然，如果我们没有取得反右派斗争的胜利，那末，工农关系和城乡关系的新发展是不可设想的。
    其次，通过全民性的整风运动，揭露出横在工农结合、城乡结合道路上的第二个障碍，是城市中的上层小资产阶级、小商小贩和农村中的富裕中农的自发资本主义倾向。我们曾经广泛地发动群众对工农关系、城乡关系进行专题鸣放和辩论。从鸣放的材料看出，城乡资本主义自发势力无孔不入地想尽一切投机取巧的办法钻社会主义的空子，拉社会主义的后腿。只要举出一个例子就够了。不久以前，洪赵县冯张乡洪飞农业社社员乔金海兄弟三人（富裕中农）竟公开煽动群众闹粮，并且借题发挥，挑拨工农关系和城乡关系。群众不听他们的话，他们就到县里、省里告状。最后群众忍无可忍，同他们进行了尖锐的说理斗争，并且从他们的家里检查出积存的余粮一万五千多斤，油料三千九百多斤，皮棉三百斤，籽棉三千二百斤。像这样的事例并不是个别的。我省从去年10月以来，农村整风运动中，群众贴出的大字报在一万万张以上。其中，大约有三分之一是揭露和批判富裕中农资本主义思想的。对于城市里的上层小资产阶级和小商小贩，也同样地通过整风运动揭露和批判了他们的资本主义思想。同时在工人群众中一部分人为“人民币”而奋斗的小资产阶级思想也受到了批判。不但如此，在思想批判的基础上，无论在城市或乡村里，都进一步地巩固和扩大了社会主义公有制。经过整风，大多数原来表现动摇的富裕中农，现在向党向社会主义靠拢了。当然，他们之中有少部分人还在观望，等着看今年的农业大跃进究竟怎样。城市里的小商小贩和一些零散的上层小资产阶级分子，也进一步地组织进社会主义的渠道中来了。很显然，如果我们不通过全民整风运动坚决地向资本主义自发势力作斗争，而任其自由泛滥，如果我们不坚决地巩固和扩大社会主义公有制，而拔掉资本主义的根子，那末，工农关系和城乡关系的新发展也是不可设想的。
    在工农结合和城乡结合问题上碰到的第三个障碍，是我们党内一部分同志的右倾保守思想。这种思想是同教条主义和经验主义的思想方法分不开的。在优先发展重工业，实行工农业同时并举的方针问题上，教条主义者不适当地强调优先发展重工业，似乎认为重工业可以离开农业而孤立地发展。所以，他们对于全国农业发展纲要，对于工业支援农业、城市支援农村，并不热心。而经验主义者，他们脑子中堆满了落后的小农经济的历史情况。他们注意农业但又不相信农业有大跃进的可能。他们惧怕因为农业落后而可能引起的工农关系、城乡关系的紧张局面，但是又不愿积极地从发展生产中找出路，而总是在财政问题上、分配问题上打圈子。他们忘记了在生产、财政、分配这三件事中，起决定作用的是生产，唯有加快工农业生产建设的发展速度，才能避免可怕的紧张局面。他们看不到工业和农业同时高速度地发展的可能性，而主张先农后工，主张工农生活、城乡生活彻底拉平。正因为如此，他们对于工业化，对于农村支援城市、农业支援工业，也并不热心。这样看来，教条主义者和经验主义者对于工人和农民、工业和农业、城市和乡村的关系，似乎各走一个极端，实际上他们的思想方法，归根到底，却有一个共同的特点，这就是他们把这三对关系中互相矛盾的一面夸大为主要的一面，而把统一性的一面缩小为次要的一面或者根本加以否定。这种片面的思想方法使他们看不到在我国社会主义制度的条件下，这三对关系的双方在各个根本问题上的利益的共同性是主要的，它们之间在目前具体利益上的相互矛盾是有的而且是经常会有的，但只居于次要地位。正因为如此，教条主义者和经验主义者在建设事业中，都只能用一条腿（或者左腿，或者右腿）走路，而不能用两条腿走路。这就不能不使他们陷入右倾保守主义的泥坑，而不能理解党的多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线对于促进工农结合、城乡结合的深远意义。很显然，如果我们不通过党内的整风，向右倾保守思想、教条主义思想、经验主义思想进行斗争，那末，我们就不能顺利地贯彻执行党的多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线。而工农关系和城乡关系的新发展也是不可设想的。
    为消灭工农关系和城乡关系的本质差别创造条件
    工农关系和城乡关系的发展前途，是工人和农民、城市和乡村之间的本质差别的消失。当然，这是一个长期的发展过程。但是在目前过渡时期中，我们具有这样的思想准备，并且在实际工作中有步骤地为它创造精神上的和物质上的条件，是有必要的。如果说在过去民主革命阶段中就有了社会主义革命的因素和萌芽，那末在现在过渡时期中，也必然会出现共产主义阶段的因素和萌芽，而这种因素和萌芽，在城乡社会主义大协作的运动中开始出现了。我们应该重视它、宝贵它。我们应该本着远处着眼、近处着手的精神，使工农关系和城乡关系不断地向前发展。
    工农关系和城乡关系同其他方面的生产关系一样，必须适合社会生产力发展的需要。半年多以来的实践证明，为了使工农关系和城乡关系加速地向前发展，首先要注意的事是工农业的生产建设。事实是这样，我们首先抓住了工农业的大跃进，争取在五年或者更多一点的时间内，实现全国农业发展纲要所规定的任务，同时争取在五年内使地方工业的总产值达到工农业总产值的百分之六十至百分之七十，并且初步地实现农业机械化、农村电力化。这样就给工农关系和城乡关系提出了以下一些新的问题，而这些问题的解决，不但促进着社会生产力的发展，同时也改变着工农关系、城乡关系本身的面貌。
      （一）重工业和轻工业的比例问题。这个问题是同农业增产粮食和增产轻工业原料的比例关系相联系的。农业对工业的发展不但有促进作用的一面，同时还有制约作用的一面。现在的问题是，农业社一方面急于解决粮食的紧张状况，不愿扩大经济作物的种植面积，这就势必要影响轻工业的发展。另一方面，农业社又迫切地要求重工业更多更快地供给以机器、电力、化学肥料，等等。但是，重工业过快，轻工业过慢，就不利于工业建设资金的积累，也不利于刺激农业更快地发展。因此，合理地安排重工业和轻工业、粮食作物和经济作物的比例，并且根据全国情况和本省情况，使重工业、轻工业、农业三者之间的供、产、销关系有一个大体的综合平衡，这是使工农业同时并举和城乡共同繁荣的一个重要关键。按照我省的具体条件，在当前苦战三年期内，重工业发展的速度可能而且需要比第二个五年计划的后两年快些，而轻工业则相反。但是考虑到丰富的野生植物资源可供作轻工业原料的条件，我们在五年内，力争把轻、重工业的比例，控制在四、六开或者对半开的比例，这是必要的、可能的。
      （二）中小工业城市的兴起和劳动政策问题。由于全党全民办工业的结果，现在的县城和集镇，必将逐步地发展成为中小工业城市。沿着缩小城乡差别的方向，我们已经制订出一个五年到十年的发展中小工业城市的长远规划。在这里碰到的主要问题是，由于工农业同时跃进，引起城乡争夺劳动力的紧张局面。今年已经发生了这种情况。从目前农村和城市中现有劳动力的利用率还远没有发挥出来的情况来看，只要采取精简脱离生产人员，调整劳动组织，实行技术改革，提倡“一人多艺，一机（机器）多用”，各单位实行互相调剂等项办法，就可以使劳动力的利用率提高几倍甚至十几倍。但是，从长远来看，由于工业的迅速发展，仅靠这些办法还不能完全解决问题。出路是：在轻重工业原料产地的中小城市多办中小企业，特别是小型企业。这不但可以使供产销更好地结合，而且易于按照工作的多少而灵活地使用农村劳动力和其他非专业的工人。今后，县和县以下的企业，应该少用固定工人，而多用长期合同工人和临时工人，实行“亦工亦农”的政策。这种政策根据我们的经验：也可以在大型企业，特别是建筑业和煤矿中适当地推行。为此，要在农业社普遍实行预备工制度，即农业社在进行劳动规划时，在全劳力中确定百分之几为预备工人，并且要把这种预备工制度同全省各个城乡经济协作区统一起来。实行亦工亦农的政策和预备工制度，必须有一个新的劳动工资制度。我们已经拟就了这样一个劳动工资制度，并且正在五个县作典型试验。我们认为长治市淮海机械厂工人提出的“工作赶先进，生活看农民”的口号，应该成为所有工人的口号。
      （三）生产、积累、消费之间的关系问题。在全面大跃进的情况下，这三者之间出现不平衡是必然的。但是只要紧紧掌握生产这个中心环节，就不必惧怕。当然，我们必须注意及时地发现和调整已经露头和出现的不平衡现象。否则，就会对生产和工农、城乡生活发生不利的影响。对于工农生活、城乡生活的差别，应当注意作适当的调整，避免不合理的过大的差别。一定的合理的差别是必要的。对于农业社、手工业社的公共积累和个人消费之间的比例，随着生产的跃进，应当提高公共积累的比重，以便购置大批生产资料，促进重工业的发展和农业的发展。但是提高到何等高度为合适？有人主张，既然要苦战三年，那末三年内个人的消费水平应该不提高或者再降低一些。如果按照这种意见去做，就势必不利于轻工业的发展和城乡人民生活的调节。因此，随着生产的发展，在提高公共积累的同时，也要使个人的消费水平有一定的增长。在苦战三年期内，可以增长得少些，往后就可以多些。另外，还有一个生产发展状况不平衡的问题。现在，我省各地的农业社和手工业社穷富悬殊的现象相当明显。有些公共财产和群众收入突出富裕的社，在干部和群众中滋长着消极因素，以至不利于工农结合和城乡结合。这种现象，现在虽然还只是少数的，但是发展下去，可以设想，到将来由集体所有制过渡到全民所有制的时候，还会是一场激烈的斗争。在目前过渡时期中，我们需要注意的是，要使工农业生产的发展，在地区分布上力求做到大体平衡；对于农业社、手工业社利用矿产资源、森林资源以及其他自然资源，国家应当及时地制定适当的政策；要灵活地运用统购统销政策、税收政策和价格政策，来调节集体所有制经济内部的积累和消费的矛盾，调节各地区集体所有制经济相互间的不平衡现象，调节集体所有制和全民所有制两种经济相互间的矛盾。
    毛泽东同志指示我们，“思想工作和政治工作是一切工作的灵魂和统帅”。为了进一步地巩固工人阶级领导下的工农联盟和发展工农、城乡之间的同志式的互助合作关系，必须依照毛泽东同志的这个指示，全面地不断地加强党的思想工作和政治工作。对于现在还存在的两个剥削阶级，过去我们对他们已经进行过一系列的斗争和改造工作。今后，还必须继续进行对他们的改造工作和必要的斗争。但是，在今后长时期内，工作量更大、更艰巨的是对城乡原来的小资产阶级的思想改造，特别是对农民小生产者和富裕中农的思想改造工作更为重要。因为现在工人队伍中很大一批新工人是农民，将来成批涌进到工人队伍中来的，还是农民。如何在这次全民整风运动的基础上，在农村中加强党的政治思想工作，以巩固和发展整风成果，这是我们必须重视的问题。现在，我们正在全省农村中推广万荣县创造的一个行之有效的经验，叫做，三校、三爱三勤日、一部、一室。三校——即每个农业社都有夜党校、夜团校、业余文化技术学校。三爱三勤日——即按照群众集体制订的三爱（爱国家、爱社会主义、爱社）三勤（勤俭建国、勤俭办社、勤俭持家）公约，每月有一日在俱乐部开群众性的由党支部领导的民主生活会议，有大字报、有鸣放和辩论。这也就是每月一次小整风。一部——即每个社有一个俱乐部，作为群众进行文化艺术活动和学习科学技术知识的公共场所。一室——即每个社有一个展览室。这一套办法，凡是能够坚持实行的，不仅可以不断地提高群众的社会主义觉悟，而且还可以使人民内部的矛盾得到及时的正确处理。这个经验，在城市的企业里也是可以仿行的。为了加速缩小工农、城乡间的差别，在注意加强政治思想工作的同时，还必须大力在农村中开展文化革命和技术革命运动。我们在全省组织城乡协作中，强调了城市在文化革命和技术革命上应该尽可能地给农村以援助。列宁说过：“改造小农，改造他们的整个心理和习惯，是需要经过几代的事情。只有物质基础，只有技术，只有在农业中大规模地使用拖拉机和机器，只有大规模地实行电气化，才能解决这个和小农有关的问题，才能使他们的整个心理健全起来。”由此可见，把政治、文化、技术三者结合起来而以政治为统帅，推动工农业跃进再跃进，实现文化革命和技术革命的历史任务，这是加速缩小工农差别、城乡差别的必由之路。　（小插题是编辑部加的）
