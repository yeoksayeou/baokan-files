(Our Wuhan, May 23rd dispatch) Reporter Cao Baoming reports: The "one-dragon" experimental plot leadership method has enabled the Zhenhuan Yarn Factory to catch up from being the worst in the city in product quality to reaching the advanced level in the city, and approaching the advanced level in the country. The main product, 32-count yarn, has jumped from all being substandard in October last year to a 100% standard product rate. In April, 88.5% even reached the superior first grade, and some has begun to be exported. The quality of the twill fabric was also rated as the second best in the country.

The Ministry of Textile Industry and the National Textile Trade Union recently convened a field meeting at the Zhenhuan Yarn Factory, gathering more than 200 representatives from 18 regions across the country to promote their experience of catching up from backwardness to advancement.

The Zhenhuan Yarn Factory used to have a saying: "The three olds haven't gone, and the four olds are coming." The "three olds" refer to the fact that they are a factory of nearly forty years: old factory buildings, old machines, and old workers. The "four olds" mean that their leadership work is not thorough: old problems, old reasons, old opinions, and old solutions. Their production has long lagged behind the other four yarn factories in the city. But in the past, they always emphasized that the factory's equipment was poor and could not be compared with other factories. They did not admit that their work was backward, and believed that their production was much better than in the early days of liberation, blindly complacent, and were called "backward complacency." During the rectification movement, the factory organized a major debate on product quality, seriously criticizing this conservative and complacent mentality, and then established the idea of "admitting backwardness, getting rid of backwardness, and catching up with advanced standards." They sent people to study advanced experiences in yarn factories in this city, Qingdao, Tianjin, and Zhengzhou. They also adopted the method of "soldiers against soldiers, generals against generals," from the manager and chief engineer to the shift workers and auxiliary workers, all went to the most advanced Wuhan State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1 to study, determined to "work hard for a year to catch up with State-owned Cotton Mill (No. 1)." The factory's leading cadres also ate, lived, and worked with the workers, thoroughly changing their leadership style. On this basis, starting in January, they also set up experimental machines in each process from raw cotton processing to finished product delivery, based on the production characteristics of the yarn factory's multi-process and multi-machine, making these machines connected into a "one-dragon" system, and using the leadership method of planting experimental plots to implement the mass line in production management and realize "participating in production, leading production." Therefore, in recent months, the factory has comprehensively completed the state plan, and the quality has made a leap forward.

The factory has initially explored specific experiences such as "improving the technical research group," "everyone for the dragon, the dragon for everyone," and "three combinations, two meetings, four coordinations, and one implementation" in applying the "one-dragon" experimental plot leadership method. These are all for further solving the combination of leadership and the masses, theory and practice, and typical and comprehensive issues.

Their "three combinations" refer to the fact that the "one-dragon" experimental plot should be jointly participated in by leading cadres, technical cadres, and veteran workers, combining the experiences of the three parties. "Two meetings" means that leading cadres (managers, chief engineers) go to the "dragon" in the morning to study problems and measures, and go to the "dragon" in the afternoon to check the implementation, meeting with the "one-dragon" at least twice a day. In this way, the contact between the leadership and the masses is strengthened, and problems can be discovered from the "one-dragon" experiment at any time, and political and ideological work and technical organization measures can be strengthened in a timely manner. For example, improving the quality of leather rollers is one of the keys to improving the quality of yarn. After delving into the "one-dragon," they discovered that improving the quality of leather rollers involves both technical and ideological issues. Therefore, while taking technical measures, manager Peng Ruizhi and chief engineer Zuo Xieqing both visited Chen Shide, a leather roller worker with more than 30 years of experience, to help him overcome the complacent mentality that "the current quality of leather rollers is almost good enough." The two trade union cadres participating in the leather roller workshop also carried out ideological work in the group and helped them solve the problems of ventilation and humidity in the factory building. In this way, the leather roller workers took active action, making the quality of leather rollers surpass all factories in the city, and significantly improving the quality of yarn.

Their "improving the technical research group" refers to absorbing veteran workers to participate in the technical research group, combining theory and practice in technical work, and establishing a strong technical leadership core. "One implementation" refers to the fact that various technical measures must obtain experimental results, changing the past situation where many measures were abandoned halfway without drawing conclusions. After implementing this, their technical work has developed rapidly. For example, the improvement of the "condenser opening," which has a significant effect on the quality of fine yarn, was achieved by technical deputy director Dai Jialin and maintenance veteran worker Xiao Zhengyuan and others after nearly a month of experiments on the "one-dragon."

Their "everyone for the dragon, the dragon for everyone" and "four coordinations" refer to the fact that the entire factory supports the one-dragon experiment, and after the one-dragon obtains experience, it is immediately promoted throughout the factory, closely combining the cultivation of typical examples and comprehensive promotion. When the first piece of superior yarn in the city appeared on the "one-dragon" of the fine yarn workshop, the workers cheered it as a "soaring dragon" and demanded that the experience of the "one-dragon" be immediately promoted on their own machines. The workshop also immediately formulated a plan to generally overhaul the fine yarn machines according to the experience of the "one-dragon." (Attached pictures)

Top: When the fine yarn workshop was trialing "one-dragon" production, it was decided to use the backward No. 65 machine, which the workers called the "tiger car," as the experimental machine. Hu Lanying, who operated this machine, was not very skilled, and the return flower rate was often 0.8% - 1%, and labor discipline was also poor, but during the rectification movement, Hu Lanying changed. Her return flower rate dropped to 0.3% - 0.27%. Moreover, the first piece of superior yarn in Wuhan City appeared on her machine. Now she has become a model for the entire workshop.

    震寰纱厂乘“一条龙”赶上先进
    本报武汉23日电　记者曹葆铭报道：“一条龙”试验田的领导方法，使震寰纱厂的产品质量由全市倒数第一赶上了全市先进水平，并接近全国先进水平。主要产品三十二支纱已从去年10月全部不够标准，跃进到100％的标准品率，4月份还有88.5％达到上等一级，开始部分出口；斜纹布的质量，也被评为全国第二位。
    纺织工业部和全国纺织工会最近召集全国十八个地区的代表二百多人，在震寰纱厂举行现场会议，推广他们由落后赶上先进的经验。
    震寰纱厂过去有句话：“三老未去，四老又来。”“三老”是指他们是个近四十年的工厂：厂房老、机器老、人老。“四老”是说他们的领导工作不深入：老问题、老原因、老提意见、老不解决。他们的生产也就长期落在全市其他四个纱厂的后面。但他们过去总强调本厂设备差，不能同别厂比，不承认自己工作落后，并且认为本厂的生产比解放初期好多了，盲目自满，被人叫做“落后的自满情绪”。在整风运动中，这个厂组织了关于产品质量的大辩论，对这种保守自满情绪认真进行了批判，进而树立起“承认落后、摆脱落后、赶上先进”的思想，先后派人到本市、青岛、天津、郑州各纱厂学习先进经验。他们还采取“兵对兵、将对将”的办法，从经理、总工程师到值车工、辅助工，都去全市最先进的武汉国棉一厂学习，决心“苦战一年，赶上国棉（一厂）”。厂的领导干部又和工人同吃、同住、同劳动，彻底转变领导作风。在这个基础上，他们从1月起又根据纱厂多工序、多机台的生产特点，从原棉加工到成品出厂的各工序都设置试验机台，使这些机台连成“一条龙”，并运用种试验田的领导方法，在生产管理上贯彻群众路线，实现“参加生产，领导生产”。因此，近几个月来工厂全面完成国家计划，质量有飞跃进展。
    这个厂在运用“一条龙”试验田的领导方法上，已初步摸索出“健全技术研究组”、“人人为龙，龙为人人”和“三结合、两见面、四配合、一贯彻”等具体经验。这些都是为了进一步解决领导与群众、理论与实践、典型与全面的结合问题。
    他们的“三结合”，是指“一条龙”的试验田要由领导干部、技术干部和老工人共同参加，将三方面的经验结合起来。“两见面”是领导干部（经理、总工程师）上午去“龙”上研究问题和措施，下午去“龙”上检查贯彻情况，每天最少同“一条龙”见面两次。这样，领导与群众的联系加强，能随时从“一条龙”的试验中发现问题，及时加强政治思想工作和技术组织措施。例如，提高皮辊质量是提高纱支质量的关键之一。他们深入“一条龙”中，便发现提高皮辊质量既有技术问题，也有思想问题。因此在采取技术措施的同时，经理彭瑞芝和总工程师左燮卿都到具有三十多年工龄的皮辊工人陈士德家中访问，帮助他克服“目前皮辊质量差不多”的自满情绪。参加皮辊房劳动的两个工会干部，也在小组中进行思想工作，并帮助他们解决了厂房通风和潮湿的问题。这样，皮辊工人们积极行动起来，使皮辊质量超过全市各厂，使纱支质量显著提高。
    他们的“健全技术研究组”是指吸收老工人参加技术研究组，在技术工作上把理论与实践结合起来，树立强有力的技术领导核心。“一贯彻”是指各项技术措施必须得出试验结果，改变过去许多措施没得出结论便半途而废的情形。这样实行以后，他们的技术工作便有了迅速的发展。例如对细纱质量有重大作用的“集合器开口”的改进，就是由技术副主任戴家林和检修老工人萧正元等在“一条龙”上作了将近一个月的试验，才取得成功的。
    他们的“人人为龙，龙为人人”和“四配合”，是指全厂都支持一条龙试验，一条龙取得经验后，又立即在全厂推广，使培养典型和全面推广紧密结合。当细纱车间“一条龙”上出现全市第一块优级纱时，工人都欢呼它为“腾云驾雾的活龙”，要求立即将“一条龙”的经验在自己机台上推广。车间也马上订出计划，按照“一条龙”的经验普遍检修了细纱机。（附图片）
    上图：细纱车间在试行“一条龙”生产时，决定以落后的、工人称之为“老虎车”的65号车为试验机台。操纵这台车的胡兰英技术并不高，回花率经常是在0.8％——1％，劳动纪律也较差，但在整风运动中，胡兰英转变了。她的回花率降低到0.3％——0.27％。而且在她的机台上还出现了武汉市第一块优级纱，现在她已成为全车间的榜样了。

    定期的技术研究会已经在各车间坚持下来。这是钢并粗纱、技术研究组在分析半制品的伸直度、结构情况。他们将进一步改进皮辊弯曲度、锭翼、弧度，保证多出优级纱。新华社记者　杨礼门摄
