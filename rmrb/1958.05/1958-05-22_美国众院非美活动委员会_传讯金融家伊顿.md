Xinhua News Agency, New York, 20th (TASS): The U.S. House Un-American Activities Committee announced that it has subpoenaed the well-known American industrialist and financier Eaton.

Committee Chairman Richard Arens said that the committee subpoenaed Eaton because of his criticism of secret police methods, especially the methods used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States, during a television interview on May 4th.

It is believed here that another reason for the committee's subpoena of Eaton is that he has made many statements in recent months calling for peaceful coexistence and the establishment of good relations with the Soviet Union.

In his May 4th television interview, Eaton said that the United States has dozens of government agencies engaged in "investigation, eavesdropping, informing, spying and interfering in the private affairs of others."

Eaton said, "If you add up the police forces of cities, districts and states, and the personnel of various government agencies, even Hitler in his heyday did not have as many Gestapo as our country's current espionage apparatus."

    美国众院非美活动委员会
    传讯金融家伊顿
    新华社21日讯  塔斯社纽约20日讯：美国众议院非美活动委员会宣布，它传讯了美国有名的工业家和金融家伊顿。
    委员会主席理查德·阿伦斯说，委员会传讯伊顿是因为他在5月4日的电视谈话中指责了秘密警察的方式，特别是指责了联邦调查局在美国所采取的方法。
    此间认为，委员会传讯伊顿的另一个原因是，他在最近几个月来作了许多声明，要求和平共处和同苏联建立良好关系。
    伊顿在5月4日的电视谈话中说，美国有几十个政府机关从事于“调查、偷听、告密、暗探和干涉别人的私事”。
    伊顿说，“如果把各城、各区和各州的警察部队以及各种政府机关的人员加起来，即使希特勒在全盛时代也没有像我国现在的间谍机构拥有那样多的盖世太保”。
