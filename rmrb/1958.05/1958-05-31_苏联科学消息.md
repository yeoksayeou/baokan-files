    Soviet Science News
    Manned Satellite Launch
    Not Far Off
    The famous Soviet spaceflight expert, Dobronravov, said that the rapid progress of the Soviet Union in the design and launch of artificial satellites indicates that it is entirely reasonable to expect the creation of spacecraft capable of accommodating several people in the not-too-distant future.
    He said that in the future, mankind may conquer the universe along two basic directions. The first is to further improve unmanned spacecraft, and the Soviet Union's first three artificial satellites can be taken as examples of this type of spacecraft. As long as the speed of such equipment reaches eleven kilometers per second at launch, it can reach the vicinity of the moon. Then it would fly around from behind the moon and fly back near the Earth, using radio to send photos of the lunar surface and other scientific materials back to the ground. Now no one doubts that the Soviet Union will be able to launch such equipment in the future.
    The second direction for the development of spaceflight is to manufacture controllable spacecraft, which can return to a predetermined location on the ground at a calculated moment. This kind of equipment can be manufactured in the not-too-distant future.
    Utilizing Tidal Power
    To Build the Largest Power Station
    The tides in Mezen Bay on the White Sea in the Soviet Union are extremely spectacular. The high tide reaches 11 meters, making it the area with the largest tide on the Soviet Union's long coastline. Recently, the Soviet Hydroelectric Design Institute has proposed building a giant tidal power station here that utilizes this inexhaustible natural force, with a power generation capacity of 14 million kilowatts (the current world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Station has a power generation capacity of 2.1 million kilowatts). Its annual power generation can reach 36 billion kilowatt-hours. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    苏联科学消息
    发射载人卫星
    为期不会太远
    苏联著名宇宙飞行专家多勃隆拉沃夫说，苏联在人造卫星的设计和发射方面的迅速进展表明，完全可以预期在不太远的将来制成可以容纳数人的宇宙飞行器械。
    他说，今后人类可能沿着两个基本方向征服宇宙。首先就是进一步改进非操纵宇宙飞行器械，苏联头三个人造卫星可以作为这类飞行器械的例子。只要在发射时使这类器械的速度达到每秒十一公里，它就可以到达月球附近。然后从月亮背后绕过，再飞回地球附近，用无线电把月球表面的照片和其它科学材料发回地面。现在已经没有谁怀疑苏联今后能够发射这样的器械了。
    发展宇宙飞行的第二个方向就是制造可操纵的宇宙飞行器械，这种器械可以在某一事先计算好的时刻回到地面上预定的地点。这种器械在不太远的将来就可制成。
    利用潮汐力量
    建造最大电站
    苏联白海上的麦晋海湾，潮汐极为壮观。涨潮高达十一公尺，是苏联绵长的海岸线上潮汐最大的地区。最近苏联水电设计院已经提出在这里利用这种取之不尽的自然力建造发电能力达一千四百万瓩的巨型潮汐发电站（目前世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站的发电能力为二百一十万瓩），它全年的发电量可达三百六十亿度。　（据新华社讯）
