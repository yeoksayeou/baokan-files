Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: Shanxi Province is establishing six urban-rural economic collaboration zones centered on six major cities such as Taiyuan, Datong, and Yangquan. This measure transforms Shanxi Province's urban-rural collaboration from short-term, temporary, and task-specific cooperation to planned, proactive, and gradually long-term and comprehensive cooperation.

These six economic collaboration zones are formed by linking counties that are adjacent to and have close economic ties with the province's six major cities. The purpose of establishing these collaboration zones is mainly to strengthen the cooperative relationship between urban and rural areas in various places and promote a great leap forward in economic and cultural construction. Within each collaboration zone, cities are responsible for supporting the development of local industry and agricultural production in various counties. In addition to actively supporting cities with non-staple foods and industrial raw materials, this year, all counties will universally implement a reserve worker system in agricultural cooperatives to guarantee the use of temporary and contract workers in factories and mines.

Recently, economic collaboration zones centered on Taiyuan and Datong have been established, respectively. Other collaboration zones are holding or preparing to hold regional urban-rural collaboration meetings. Currently, in addition to collaborating on issues that need to be resolved, each collaboration zone will establish a collaboration committee. Each prefecture and county will assign dedicated personnel to be responsible for contacting the cities and establishing regular and irregular contact systems. To supplement the shortcomings of comprehensive contact and specialized collaboration, direct, single-line, fixed contact will also be carried out between urban factories and mines and various counties within the collaboration zone. This facilitates the development of frequent, comprehensive, and diverse collaborative activities, as well as the inspection and supervision of collaboration work, the resolution of problems, and the smooth progress of collaboration.

The urban-rural collaboration zone centered on Taiyuan City, which started collaboration activities earlier, has now signed a comprehensive collaboration plan. Taiyuan City has made short-term arrangements for supporting eighteen counties, including Qingxu and Jiaocheng, and will try its best to transfer and rush-produce a batch of power machinery and water lifting equipment for supply to rural areas. Taiyuan City also plans to assist the eighteen counties in basically achieving industrialization within three to five years; assist each county in building or expanding a "Wanbaoquan" (all-purpose) joint processing factory, establish simple fertilizer, cement, and starch factories, as well as some light industrial factories, establish some factories producing industrial raw materials, and establish small-scale thermal and hydroelectric power plants (stations). To achieve these plans, Taiyuan City will gradually organize technical personnel to help work in various counties, raise 10 million to 15 million yuan to help counties with insufficient funds set up raw material production industries, and assist various counties in training construction talents. While assisting various counties in establishing county-run industries, it will also assist various counties in developing township-run industries and organize rural industrial networks as soon as possible. The eighteen counties collaborating with Taiyuan City have determined to systematically and as much as possible meet the needs of Taiyuan City and ensure the transfer of more than 29,000 laborers to support industrial production. Datong City and the seven collaborating counties have also formulated a preliminary plan for urban and rural support.

After studying the General Line for socialist construction and conducting the rectification campaign, collaboration activities in various places have been carried out very rapidly, with actions taken while meetings are held; decisions made at the meeting are implemented immediately after the meeting. During the signing of the plan between Taiyuan City and the eighteen counties, nine factories and mines, including Jinxi Machine Factory, had already sent a batch of engineering and technical personnel to assist in the work of various counties. Responding to the invitation of Xin County and other places in the collaboration zone, Datong City also organized a comprehensive technical team including civil engineering, mechanical and electrical, and equipment installation to go to key counties to help with design and construction.

    发展城乡长期全面协作的重要措施
    山西建立六个城乡经济协作区
    据新华社太原27日电　山西省正以太原、大同、阳泉等六个主要城市为中心，建立六个城乡经济协作区。这项措施，使山西省城乡间的协作关系从过去短期的、临时的、某项工作的协作，发展成为有计划的、主动的、逐步长期和全面的协作关系。
    这六个经济协作区是以全省六个主要城市为中心，联合和这些城市邻近的、经济联系较多的县分片组成的。建立协作区的目的，主要是加强各地城乡的协作关系，促进经济文化建设的大跃进。在各个协作区内，城市负责支援各县发展地方工业和农业生产，各县除了积极支援城市副食品、工业原料外，今年将普遍在农业社实行预备工制度，保证厂矿临时工、合同工的使用。
    最近，以太原市、大同市为中心的经济协作区已经分别建立起来，其它协作区正在举行或筹备地区城乡协作会议。目前，各个协作区除了就当前需要解决的问题进行协作外，还要建立协作委员会；各专区和各县都要确定专人负责和城市进行联系，建立定期和不定期的联系制度。为了补充综合联系和专门协作的不足，在协作区内还要进行城市厂矿企业和各县之间的单直线固定联系，这样既便于开展经常、全面、多样的协作活动，同时也便于进行协作中的检查、督促工作，解决协作中的问题，促使协作顺利进行。
    开展协作活动较早的以太原市为中心的城乡协作区，目前已经签订了全面协作的规划。太原市已把支援清徐、交城等十八个县的计划作了短期安排，尽可能地再抽调和赶制出一批动力机械、提水设备等供应农村。太原市还打算在三年到五年内协助十八个县基本上实现工业化；协助每个县新建、扩建一座“万宝全”联合加工厂，建立简易化肥、水泥、淀粉和一些轻工业工厂，建立一部分生产工业原料的工厂，建立小型火力水力动力厂（站）。为了实现这些计划，太原市将逐步地组织技术人员到各县帮助工作，将筹措一千到一千五百万元帮助资金不足的县筹办原料生产工业，并将协助各县培养建设人才。在协助各县建立县营工业的同时，还要协助各县发展乡办工业，尽快组织农村工业网。和太原市协作的十八个县，确定要有计划地、尽可能多地满足太原市的需要，并保证输送两万九千多个劳动力支援工业生产。大同市和协作的七个县也制定了城乡支援初步方案。
    经过全民整风和社会主义建设总路线的学习，各地开展协作活动非常迅速，边开会，边行动；会上定下来，会后马上执行。太原市和十八个县签订规划期间，晋西机器厂等九个厂矿就已派去一批工程技术人员到各县协助工作。大同市应协作区忻县等地的邀请，也组织了一个包括土建、机电、设备安装的综合技术组，到重点县去帮助设计、施工。
