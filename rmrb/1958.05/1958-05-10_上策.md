Title: The Best Policy

The inability to purchase machinery and equipment is a difficult problem encountered by many places in developing local industries. How to solve this problem is of great significance for ensuring the timely or early realization of local industrial development plans.

There are two ways to solve the problem. One is called "waiting." That is, having resources, funds, manpower, and the determination to run a factory, but failing to purchase equipment everywhere you go, so you stop and wait, wait, wait. The other is called "first getting on the horse with indigenous methods." That is, if you can't buy modern equipment, use "indigenous equipment" to replace it, and start the factory first. Mechanized production can be realized whenever modern equipment is available in the future. Jiangning County in Jiangsu Province built a local copper smelting furnace with a monthly output of five tons of copper in four days, adopting this method.

Mechanization is better than manual operation, which no one denies. Our technical revolution and cultural revolution are aimed at enabling the industrial, agricultural, transportation and other national economic sectors to achieve mechanized, electrified or semi-mechanized production in a relatively short period. But we are not dreamers, and we must proceed from reality in everything we do. If you can't buy modern equipment, first get on the horse with indigenous methods. First, you can produce what is urgently needed for current industrial and agricultural production; second, you can accumulate funds; and third, you can train talents to create conditions for future development. This is in line with the principle of achieving greater, faster, better and more economical results. And "waiting" gets nothing but wasted time.

From nothing to something, from small to large, from low-level to high-level, this is the law of development of general things. Without modern equipment, first getting on the horse with indigenous methods is in line with this law. Therefore, the method of building a local copper smelting furnace in Jiangning County is worth promoting at present.

    上策
  　王朴
    买不到机器设备，是当前许多地方发展地方工业中遇到的一个难题。怎样解决这个难题，对于保证按期或提前实现地方工业发展规划，具有重大的意义。
    有两种解决难题的办法。一种叫做“等”。这就是有了资源，有了资金，有了人力，也有了办厂的决心，但是派人到处购买设备买不到，就停下来等，等，等。另一种叫做“先用土法跨上马”。这就是买不到现代设备就用“土设备”来代替，先把工厂办起来再说，以后什么时候有现代设备就什么时候实现机械化生产。江苏省江宁县用四天时间建设一座月产五吨铜的土炼铜炉，就是采用这种办法。
    机械化比手工操作好，这是没有人否认的。我们进行技术革命和文化革命，就是为了使工业、农业、交通运输业等国民经济部门，在比较短的时间内实现机械化、电气化或半机械化生产。但是我们不是空想家，做任何事情都要从实际出发。买不到现代设备，先用土法跨上马，一则可以生产目前工农业生产急需的东西，二则可以积累资金，三则可以培养人才，为将来大发展创造条件。这是符合多快好省的方针的。而“等”，除去耽误了时间以外，什么也得不到。
    从无到有，从小到大，从低级到高级，这是一般事物发展的规律。没有现代设备，先用土法跨上马，正是合乎这个规律的。因此，江宁县建设土炼铜炉的办法，在当前很值得提倡。
