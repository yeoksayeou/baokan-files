　　Chongqing, May 12th: Over two thousand grassroots Party organizations in Chongqing have launched a major competition in branch work, fostering a new atmosphere where everyone discusses politics and everyone engages in ideological work, greatly changing the face of branch work.

　　The great leap forward in all areas urgently requires raising the level of Party branch work to a higher level. In order to further leverage the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members and the fighting bastion role of grassroots Party organizations in building socialism, the Organization Department of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee organized grassroots Party organizations with a better working foundation, such as the general branch of the large rolling mill workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, to formulate leap forward plans in early March, and put forward a letter of proposal for conducting branch work appraisal and competition, challenging Party branches throughout the city. At the same time, the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department also convened a leap forward meeting on branch work attended by Party committee secretaries, organization ministers, and branch secretaries from more than 100 units, making specific arrangements for formulating plans and organizing competitions, and successively held two on-site meetings to promptly promote and exchange competition experiences. Now, 85% of the Party branches in the city are actively participating in the competition, setting off a wave of comparing leadership methods, comparing political and ideological work, comparing contact with the masses, comparing labor production, and comparing learning. Most branches, in the process of formulating and implementing leap forward plans, first grasped the central link of improving the ideological leadership and improving leadership methods of the branch. Cultivating "experimental fields," working alongside workers, sharing weal and woe, has gradually become the norm. The Party general branch of the large rolling mill workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company put forward the slogan of "Politics and Technology to the Front Line," where leading cadres spend half a day in the office and half a day in the workshop every day, studying and experimenting with workers and engineering technicians on key production issues, resolving ideological issues on the spot, and supporting the initiatives of the masses, which has yielded great results. Many people in this workshop originally lacked confidence in the Party general branch's plan to "work hard for a year to catch up with Anshan Iron and Steel"; later, seeing the Party branch leaders going to the workshop to participate in labor and overcome difficulties with them, and successively experimenting with new technologies such as ingot transverse rolling, two of the original six major indicators have already surpassed Anshan Iron and Steel, and confidence has grown even greater. Many leading cadres of the branches, in the competition, have begun to live, eat, and labor with the workers, constantly gathering the wisdom and experience of the masses to guide the masses, so they generally feel that there are more methods, faster implementation, and the work is easier to do.

　　In organizing the competition, each branch regarded the formulation of plans and proposals, timely inspection and evaluation, as an important task. Many units, from the branch to each Party member, have formulated leap forward plans. In this way, Party members are organized through planning, and they are used as the core to mobilize the masses, and the overall tasks of the unit are specifically implemented to each person, so that everyone has a goal and everyone has something to strive for. Most branches held oath-taking rallies during the competition, organized Party members to report their achievements, to see who's plan was executed best, who contributed the most strategies and found the most tricks, and at the same time organized the masses to discuss the branch's leap forward plan, united all employees to work together to launch the competition, and turned the branch's plan into their actual actions. Therefore, in many factories, mines, and enterprises, the competition between branches and between Party members has become the core part of the current mass production competition movement centered on technological innovation. This is an important method for Party branches to strengthen their leadership over the great leap forward in production. For example, in the 35th workshop of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory, Party members can generally set an example, unite the masses, and take the lead in carrying out technological innovation in the competition. Party members in this workshop account for only 17% of the total number of workers, but in the 740 rationalization proposals put forward by the workers in the entire workshop in the past 40 days, Party members put forward 310. 95% of the Party members in the entire workshop have improvements in technology, operation, and other aspects. Some technological innovations have increased production efficiency by more than 1,000 times, and it only takes seven hours to complete the equivalent of five years of work. In addition to mutually supervising the implementation of the leap forward plan, Party members also organized shock teams to help non-Party comrades who had poor plans to improve and improve their skills.

　　Due to the launch of the competition, many Party branches appear vibrant, and their work is lively and vigorous. Party members are actively learning politics and culture, and the purchase of technical books has generally increased. Talking about thoughts, talking about politics, and seeking progress have become a common trend. The relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer. Party members in the 35th workshop of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory have each made a confidant. Party members in the large rolling mill workshop of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company have made 213 confidants through various methods such as family visits and individual talks.

　　In order to deepen the competition movement, the Organization Department of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee recently held an on-site meeting to promote the experience of branches such as the fourth workshop of the Changan Machinery Factory, which have carried out the competition well, emphasizing the full mobilization of the masses, strengthening the leadership of technological innovation and the upcoming technological revolution movement, and emphasizing that the competition must be closely integrated with the current central tasks.

### 重庆两千多党的基层组织开展竞赛  支部工作面貌大大改观

　　重庆两千多党的基层组织开展竞赛
    支部工作面貌大大改观
    本报重庆12日电　重庆市两千多个党的基层组织开展支部工作大竞赛，形成人人谈政治、个个做思想工作的新风气，大大改变了支部工作的面貌。
    各项工作大跃进，迫切要求把党的支部工作提到更高的水平。为了进一步发挥党员和党的基层组织在建设社会主义中的先锋作用和战斗堡垒作用，中共重庆市委组织部在3月初就组织工作基础较好的重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间总支等党的基层组织制订跃进规划，并提出开展支部工作评比、竞赛的倡议书，向全市的党支部挑战。同时，市委组织部还召开了包括一百多个单位的党委书记、组织部长、支部书记等参加的支部工作跃进会议，对制订规划、组织竞赛作了具体布置，并接连召开了两次现场会议，及时推广、交流竞赛的经验。现在全市已有85％的党支部积极参加竞赛，掀起了比领导方法、比政治思想工作、比联系群众、比劳动生产、比学习的热潮。大部分支部在制订和执行跃进计划过程中，首先抓住了提高支部领导思想和改进领导方法这一中心环节。种“试验田”，和工人一起劳动，同呼吸、共甘苦，已逐步成为风气。重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间党总支提出“政治、技术到现场”的口号，领导干部每天半天办公，半天到车间，针对生产上的关键问题，和工人、工程技术人员一起研究、试验，当场解决思想问题，支持群众的倡议，收效很大。这个车间原来不少人对党总支提出“苦战一年赶过鞍钢”的规划，缺乏信心；后来看见党支部领导人员下车间参加劳动，和他们一起克服困难，接连试验成功了钢锭横轧等新技术，原来规划的六大指标已有两项超过鞍钢，信心更大了。很多支部的领导干部在竞赛中，已开始做到与工人同住、同吃、同劳动，不断集中群众的智慧、经验来指导群众，因此，普遍感到办法多、推行快、工作好做了。
    在组织竞赛中，各支部都把订规划、提措施，及时检查、评比，作为一项重要的工作。许多单位从支部到每个党员都订了跃进规划。这样就通过规划把党员组织起来，又以他们为核心，带动群众，把本单位总的任务具体贯彻到每个人，使得人人有目标，个个有奔头。多数支部在竞赛过程中都举行了誓师大会，组织党员报告自己的成就，看谁的规划执行得好，谁献的计策和找的窍门多，同时组织群众讨论支部的跃进规划，团结全体职工同心协力展开竞赛，把支部的规划变为他们的实际行动。因此在不少厂矿企业部门，支部之间和党员之间开展的竞赛，已成为目前群众性的以技术革新为中心内容的生产竞赛运动的核心部分。这是党支部加强对生产大跃进领导的重要方法。例如，重庆建设机床厂第三十五车间党支部，在竞赛中一般党员都能以身作则，团结群众，带头开展技术革新。这个车间的党员只占工人总数的17％，但在最近四十天全车间工人提的七百四十件合理化建议中，党员就提了三百零十件。全车间95％的党员都在技术、操作等方面有改进。有的革新技术提高生产效率一千多倍，只要七小时就能完成相当于五年的工作量。党员除了相互督促实现跃进计划外，还组织了突击组帮助完成计划差的非党同志改进、提高技术。
    由于开展竞赛，许多党支部都显得朝气勃勃，工作生动、活泼。党员积极学习政治、文化，购买技术书籍的普遍增加。谈思想、谈政治、求进步，成了普遍的风气。党群关系密切了。重庆建设机床厂第三十五车间党员每人都交上了知心朋友。重庆钢铁公司大型轧钢车间的党员采用家庭访问、个别谈心等多种方式，结交了二百十三个知心朋友。
    为了使竞赛运动深入发展，中共重庆市委组织部最近召开了现场会议，推广了竞赛开展得好的长安机器厂第四车间等支部的经验，强调充分发动群众，加强对技术革新和即将到来的技术革命运动的领导，竞赛必须密切结合当前中心任务。　（廖永祥）
