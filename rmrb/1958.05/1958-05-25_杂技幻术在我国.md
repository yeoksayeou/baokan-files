Acrobatics and illusionism in our country existed as early as the Warring States period. During the Warring States period, there was an acrobat from the State of Song who performed his skills before Lord Yuan of Song: he juggled seven swords simultaneously, keeping five of them constantly in the air. Lord Yuan was greatly amazed and immediately rewarded him with gold and silk. (See Liezi, Shuofu, Chapter 8)

Also during the Warring States period, there was a master of illusion who could create thunder in winter and ice in summer, transforming flying birds into running beasts and running beasts into flying birds. (See Liezi, Zhou Muwang, Chapter 3)

Although the above stories may not be based on actual people or events, it is evident that acrobatics and illusionism were very popular during the Warring States period.

During the Han Dynasty, acrobatics and illusionism in our country continued to enrich and develop, and techniques such as sword swallowing and fire breathing, introduced from the Western Regions and South Asia, were also absorbed. According to Zhang Heng's description in the "Western Capital Rhapsody," the following acrobatic and illusionistic programs were already present in the imperial court at that time: weight lifting, xuntong (tumbling and inverting on a long pole), chongxia (i.e., Yanxi, thrusting a spear into a bamboo mat and passing through it with the body), yan zhuo (placing a basin of water in front and then leaping up and spreading the hands to imitate a swallow bathing on the surface of the water), tiao wan jian (i.e., juggling short swords), double tightrope walking, snake charming, sword swallowing, fire breathing, drawing a river on the ground, and conjuring clouds and mist.

During the Northern Wei Dynasty, Luoyang was a center of acrobatics, with "rare birds and strange beasts dancing in the palace halls, illusions flying through the air, unseen by the world, extraordinary and strange arts gathered there. Peeling donkeys, throwing into wells, planting jujubes, planting melons, all can be eaten in an instant. Spectators, men and women, were dazzled and their eyes were lost." (See "Records of the Buddhist Temples of Luoyang," Volume 1)

During the Northern Qi Dynasty, acrobatics and illusionism included "pulling wells, planting melons, killing horses, peeling donkeys, and other strange and unusual things, more than a hundred items." (See "Book of Sui," Volume 15, Music)

During the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui, the programs of acrobatics and illusionism became even richer, including, in addition to those mentioned above: using hands to jump and play with cartwheels, stone mortars, and large urns; two people carrying bamboo poles on their heads, with people singing, dancing, and tumbling on the poles; and divine turtles carrying mountains, etc. (See above book)

During the Tang Dynasty, many books contained records of acrobatics and illusionism. "Miscellaneous Records of Duyang" records:

There was a prostitute named Shi Huo Hu, who had five adopted daughters, each eight or nine years old. They stretched five bowstrings on a hundred-foot pole, and had each of the five girls stand on one string, wearing five-colored clothes, holding flags and spears, singing, dancing, bowing, and flying back and forth. At that time, the audience was dizzy and frightened.

There was a magician named Mi Bao who applied five-colored patterns to candles two inches thick and a foot long. When burned throughout the night, the patterns remained intact, forming the shape of pavilions, terraces, and halls. (This is the lamp magic in illusionism)

"Records of Illusionary Performances" states:

Ma Ziran puts his fist into his nose, and when he takes it out, his nose is as before. He also plants melons on a mat with soil in a tile container. In a moment, vines grow, flowers bloom, and fruits are borne, which can be picked and eaten. He also finds money all over his body and on his socks, an unknown amount, throws it into a well, and calls it out, and it flies out one by one. People take and collect it, but soon lose it again.

Although this record in "Records of Illusionary Performances" seems a bit absurd, it proves that illusionism in the Tang Dynasty was indeed very developed.

By the Song Dynasty, there were even more acrobatic and illusionistic programs, including: pole climbing, somersaulting, kicking fists, stepping on stilts, carrying water on a rope, passing through a knife gate, sleeping on a wall, hanging an incense burner in the air, eating needles... etc. (See "Dream Log of Liang")

Since the Song Dynasty, acrobatics and illusionism in our country have continued to absorb foreign programs and continuously develop and enrich. It shows the infinite wisdom of the working people of our country. However, in the old society, acrobats were looked down upon, and not only was their safety during performances not guaranteed, but it was also not easy for them to get enough to eat. Only in today's liberated world have acrobats and their outstanding skills received the attention and protection they deserve. Acrobatic programs are also changing with each passing day, constantly adding new content. Taking the China Acrobatic Troupe in Beijing as an example, they are both inheriting and organizing national traditional programs, such as Zhong Pan (the strongman's bamboo pole performance), Fan Daqi (tumbling with a large flag), and Feiche Zoubi (motorcycle stunts), while also learning from the experience of the Soviet circus, practicing trampoline jumping, equestrianism, dog tricks, bear tricks, and trapeze. These programs are scheduled to meet the audience on August 1 this year. (Attached pictures)

### 杂技幻术在我国

    杂技幻术在我国
  　周为民
    我国的杂技幻术，早在战国时已经有了。战国时候，宋国有一个耍杂技的人，在宋元君的面前表演技艺：他同时抛弄七柄剑，使五柄剑常在空中。元君大惊，即赐金帛给他。（见列子说符第八）
    也是战国时候，有一个会幻术的人能够在冬天响雷，夏天造冰，使飞鸟变走兽，走兽变飞鸟。（见列子周穆王第三）
    上面的故事，虽然未必确有其人其事，但杂技幻术，在战国时已很流行，却是显然可见的了。
    汉朝时候，我国的杂技幻术继续丰富发展，从西域、南亚传入的吞刀吐火之类也被吸收了。据张衡西京赋的描写，那时宫庭中已有下列的许多杂技幻术节目：扛鼎、寻橦（在长竿上面翻腾倒竖）、冲狭（即燕戏，把矛插在簟席中，以身穿投而过）、燕濯（面前放盆水，然后踊身张手在盆水面上作燕浴的动作）、跳丸剑（即抛接短剑）、双人走索、弄蛇、吞刀、吐火、划地成川、兴云吐雾。
    北魏时的洛阳，杂技也盛极一时，“奇禽怪兽，舞抃殿庭，飞空幻惑，世所未睹，异端奇术，总萃其中。剥驴、投井。植枣、种瓜，须臾之间，皆得食之。士女观者，目乱睛迷。”（见洛阳伽蓝记卷一）
    北齐时杂技幻术有：“拔井、种瓜、杀马、剥驴等奇怪异端，百有余物。”（见隋书卷十五音乐志）
    隋炀帝时，杂技巧术的节目更丰富了，除上面所述的而外，还有：用手跳弄车轮、石臼、大瓮器；两个人顶戴竹竿，竿上有人歌舞翻腾；神鳌负山等。（见上书）
    唐时，许多书都有关于杂技幻术的记载。“杜阳杂编”记道：
    有妓女石火胡，挈养女五人才八九岁，于百尺竿上张弓弦五条，令五女各居一条之上，衣五色衣，执?持戈，歌舞俯仰，来去如飞。是时观者目眩心怯。
    有术士名叫米宝，在粗二寸长尺余的蜡烛上施五色文，烧之竟夜不尽，其上成楼阁台殿之状。（这就是幻术中的灯法）
    幻戏志有道：
    马自然以拳入鼻，及出拳，鼻如故。又于席上以瓦器盛土种瓜，须臾，引蔓生花，结实取食。又于遍身及袜上摸钱，不知多少，投井中，呼之一一飞出，人有收取，顷之复失。
    幻戏志里的这段记载，虽然似乎有点荒诞，但是，从这里可以证明唐代幻术的确已经很发达了。
    到了宋代，杂技幻术的节目更多了，有：上竿、打筋斗、踢拳、踏跷、索上担水、过刀门、壁上睡、虚空挂香罏、吃针……等。（见梦粱录）
    自宋朝以后，我国的杂技幻术不断吸收外来的节目，不断发展丰富。表明了我国劳动人民的无穷智慧。但是在旧社会，杂技艺人是被人贱视的，不但他们表演时的安全毫无保障，就是要得一温饱也很不容易。只有在解放了的今天，杂技艺人和他们卓越的技术才受到了应有的重视与保障。杂技节目也正在日新月异、不断增加新的内容。以北京中国杂技团为例，他们一面继承和整理了民族传统节目，如中蟠（大力士的竹竿表演）、翻大旗（翻跟斗）、飞车走壁等，一面正在学习苏联马戏团的经验，练习跳蹦床、马术、耍狗、耍熊和空中飞人等。这些节目，准备在今年8月1日与观众见面。（附图片）
