Moscow Dispatch, May 29 (Reporter Chen Quanbi): Comrade Karasev, a member of the Invention Committee of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Director of the Invention Rights Department, recently met with reporters to discuss the situation of the invention and innovation movement actively being carried out in Soviet production.

Karasev first said that the Soviet Party and government attach great importance to mass innovation and invention. He said that almost every professional conference held by the Central Committee studies and discusses this issue. In 1956, a national conference of inventors and innovators was also held, which made detailed provisions on how to carry out the invention and innovation movement and solve some specific problems in invention and innovation. The government uses the laws it has promulgated over time to ensure the smooth progress of the invention and innovation movement. The first law on inventions and innovations was signed and promulgated by Lenin in 1919. The second was promulgated in 1941. Since it has been too long, this law can no longer fully adapt to the current situation, so the government is preparing to announce a new law recently. The basic spirit of the new law is that the government will use all its strength to promote the creative spirit of the masses and create all conditions to ensure the smooth progress of the invention and innovation movement. The specific measures are: (1) More reasonably stipulate the rights of inventors and innovators, such as stipulating new bonus amounts, vacation systems, and simplifying the procedures for issuing invention certificates; (2) Strengthen specific assistance to inventors and innovators, such as helping inventors write invention reports, prepare charts, make models, and conduct experiments. During the invention and innovation process, inventors can invite various experts to solve difficult problems for him, listen to various scientific reports and obtain various relevant scientific data for free; (3) Accelerate the application of inventions and innovations in production. After a new invention is proposed, a certain factory and a certain expert will be immediately designated to conduct experiments. Important inventions will be handled by a special committee immediately, and more important ones will be directly handed over to the government for comprehensive promotion; (4) Strengthen the publicity of inventions and innovations.

The Soviet Union issues certificates for mass innovation and invention. But there are two types of certificates, one is an invention certificate, that is, after the invention is registered, the invention right belongs to the state, and the state helps him realize his invention. This is a method commonly used by socialist countries. The other is a patent certificate, that is, after the invention is registered, the invention right belongs to the individual. This is a method currently commonly used by capitalist countries. The Soviet Union has not finally abolished this method today, but due to the improvement of the masses' awareness, this patent right has practically ceased to exist. Because the Soviet people feel that there is no need to monopolize invention rights in today's situation.

When talking about the achievements the Soviet Union has made in the invention and innovation movement in recent years, Karasev said that due to the Party and the government's attention and support for the invention and innovation movement, as well as the practical assistance and active rewards given to inventors and innovators, the scale of the invention and innovation movement has become larger and larger in recent years, the number of inventors and innovators and the number of inventions and innovations has become more and more, and the role in production has become greater and greater. The number of inventors and innovators in 1950 was 550,000, in 1956 it was 1.34 million, and in 1957 it was 1.557 million. The number of inventions and innovations was 1.241 million in 1950, 2.375 million in 1956, and 2.502 million in 1957. The number of inventions and innovations that have been applied to production was 655,000 in 1950, 1.404 million in 1956, and 1.5 million in 1957. As for the technological innovation caused by inventions and innovations, it has saved a lot of funds for the country. In 1957 alone, it saved the country 8 billion rubles.

Inventions and innovations are divided into three categories: new inventions, technological innovations, and rationalization proposals. According to the magnitude of their effect on production, bonuses are awarded after evaluation. The bonus is calculated according to the amount of funds saved for the country. A bonus of 200 rubles is awarded for saving 1,000 rubles, 850 rubles for saving 5,000 rubles, and 50,000 rubles for saving 1 million rubles. In 1957, the state issued a total of 398.4 million rubles in bonuses.

The state always tries its best to support mass innovation and invention and provide various conveniences. But in the United States, the situation is exactly the opposite. The United States government takes various measures to obstruct mass innovation and invention. Every invention and innovation of the American masses must pay 30 US dollars to the relevant authorities for registration, and another 30 US dollars for someone to write an invention report. If the application is not approved and a re-examination is required, another 25 US dollars must be paid. Each invention and innovation has to spend 120 US dollars just to complete the registration procedures. This disguised extortionate tax on the working people in the United States makes the mass's innovation and invention less and less.

Finally, Karasev talked about the work tasks and work situation of the Invention Committee. He said that this agency, which belongs to the Soviet Council of Ministers, was established in 1956 and is still a young agency. The tasks of the committee are as follows: (1) Review invention applications, (2) Understand and check the invention and innovation situation of the masses in various regions and departments, (3) Help relevant departments evaluate bonus quotas, (4) Conduct regular publicity work on inventions and innovations, etc.

### 发挥群众智慧　革新生产技术  苏联创造发明运动规模日大  去年共有一百五十万件　节约资金八十亿卢布

    发挥群众智慧　革新生产技术
    苏联创造发明运动规模日大
    去年共有一百五十万件　节约资金八十亿卢布
    本报莫斯科29日电　记者陈泉璧报道：苏联部长会议创造发明委员会委员兼发明权司司长卡拉雪夫，日前接见了记者，就苏联目前在生产上积极开展着的创造发明运动的情况同记者作了谈话。
    卡拉雪夫首先说，苏联党和政府对群众性的创造和发明是十分重视的，他说，差不多中央举行的每次专业性会议都研究和讨论这个问题。1956年还曾举行过一次全苏创造发明者会议，这次会议对如何开展创造发明运动和解决创造发明中的一些具体问题，曾作了详细的规定。政府通过自己历次颁布的法律，来保证创造发明运动的顺利进行。第一个关于创造发明的法律是1919年经由列宁签署公布的。第二个是1941年公布的，由于时间过久，这个法律已不能完全适应目前的情况了，所以政府最近准备公布一个新法律。新法律的基本精神就是政府要用一切力量来发扬群众的创造精神，建立一切条件来保证创造发明运动的顺利进行。具体措施是：（一）更合理地规定创造发明者的权利。如规定新的奖金额，休假制度，简化颁发发明证书手续等；（二）加强对创造发明者的具体帮助。如帮助发明者撰写发明报告、拟制图表、制造模型、进行实验。在创造发明过程中，发明者可以免费请到各种专家代他解决疑难问题，听取各种科学报告和获得各种有关的科学资料等；（三）加速发明创造在生产上的运用。新的发明提出后，立即指定某工厂和某专家进行实验。重要的发明，立即组织专门委员会来处理，更重要的将直接交给政府来处理，以便全面推广；（四）加强创造发明的宣传工作。
    苏联对群众的创造发明，一律发给证书。但证书有两种，一种是发明证，即经过发明登记后，发明权属于国家，由国家来帮助他实现他的发明。这是社会主义国家普遍采用的方法。另一种是专利证，即经发明登记后，发明权属于私人，这是资本主义国家目前普遍采用的方法，苏联今天还未最后取消这种方法，但是由于群众觉悟程度的提高，这种专利权，实际上几乎已经不存在了。因为苏联人民觉得在今天的情况下再没有独占发明权的必要了。
    谈到苏联近年来在创造发明运动方面所取得的成就时，卡拉雪夫说，由于党和政府对创造发明运动的重视和支持，以及对创造发明者所给予的实际帮助和积极奖励，近年来创造发明运动的规模愈来愈大，创造发明的人数和创造发明的数量愈来愈多，对生产发挥的作用也愈来愈大。1950年创造发明的人数为五十五万，1956年为一百三十四万，1957年为一百五十五万七千。创造发明的数量1950年为一百二十四万一千件，1956年为二百三十七万五千件，1957年为二百五十万零二千件。创造发明已经运用到生产上的创造发明数量，1950年为六十五万五千件，1956年为一百四十万零四千件，1957年为一百五十万件。至于创造发明所引起的生产技术的革新，为国家节约了大量资金。1975年就为国家节约了八十亿卢布。
    创造发明分三类：新发明、技术革新和合理化建议。按照它们对生产所起作用的大小，经评定后一律发给奖金。奖金按它们为国家节约的资金的多少来计算，节约资金一千卢布者奖金为二百卢布，节约五千卢布为八百五十卢布，节约一百万卢布为五万卢布。1957年国家共发出奖金三亿九千八百四十万卢布。
    国家对于群众性的创造发明，总是想尽一切办法加以支持，给予种种方便。但在美国，情形恰恰相反。美国政府对群众的创造发明采取各种阻碍办法。美国群众的每一创造发明要向有关机关登记时需付三十元美金，请人撰写发明报告时又需付三十元美金，倘不批准要求从新审查时须再付二十五元美金。每一创造发明仅完成登记手续就得花一百二十元美金。美国这种变相的对劳动人民的苛捐杂税，使群众的创造发明愈来愈少。
    卡拉雪夫最后谈到了创造发明委员会的工作任务和工作情况，他说，属于苏联部长会议的这个机构成立于1956年，还是一个年青的机构。委员会的任务有以下几项：（一）审查发明申请书，（二）了解和检查各地和各部门群众的创造发明情形，（三）帮助各有关部门评定奖金定额，（四）进行创造发明的经常性的宣传工作等。
