From the Hexi Corridor Basin to High-Altitude Mountain Areas
Gansu Expands Rice Planting by 500,000 Mu

    (Our dispatch) This year, Gansu Province is expanding rice planting areas in the eastern and central mountainous regions and the Hexi Corridor basin by nearly 500,000 mu, an increase of two and a half times compared to last year's planting area. Currently, most of the rice paddies in the eastern and central regions have been planted with seedlings, which are growing sturdily. The rice paddies in the Hexi Corridor are also sowing seeds and cultivating seedlings.

    Last year, the province planted 140,000 mu of rice, with an average yield of 387 jin per mu. At that time, the rice fields were mainly located in the irrigated areas of the Hexi Corridor and the river valleys along the upper reaches of the Jialing River and both banks of the Bailong River. This year, with the development of water conservancy projects, rice is also being planted on a large scale in the eastern mountainous areas. Some areas are even planting rice in high-altitude mountainous areas at elevations of 1,800 to 2,100 meters. Guanghua Agricultural Cooperative in Cheng County, which achieved a bumper harvest of rice last year, attaches great importance to double-cropping rice cultivation. Each team has selected more than 700 experienced rice farmers to form rice professional groups, which are conducting rice transplanting work under the leadership of the team leader. The seedling fields are all selected in fertile paddy fields facing north and the sun. Cold-proof methods such as covering with straw curtains and setting up windbreaks with sorghum stalks are adopted, and experienced seedling cultivators are specially assigned to take care of them. Therefore, the seedlings are growing evenly and vigorously. (Zhai Qiyin)

    由河西走廊盆地到高寒山区
    甘肃扩种水稻五十万亩
    本报讯　今年甘肃省在东部、中部山区和河西走廊盆地扩展水稻面积近五十万亩，比去年种植面积增加两倍半。现在东部和中部地区的稻田大部分已插上秧，生长壮实，河西走廊的稻田也在播种育苗。
    去年全省种植了十四万亩水稻，平均每亩产量达到三百八十七斤。当时的稻田主要是在河西走廊灌溉区和嘉陵江上游，白龙江两岸河谷地区。今年随着水利事业的发展，东部山区也开始大量播种水稻，有的地区甚至把水稻种到海拔一千八百到二千一百公尺的高寒山区。去年获得水稻丰产的成县广化农业社，对双季稻栽培十分重视，各队抽出作务水稻有经验的七百多人组成水稻专业组，在队长领导下进行插秧工作。秧田都是选在北面向阳、肥沃的水田，并且采取草帘加盖，用高粱秆设挡风屏障等防寒方法，派育秧有经验的人专门看管，因此，秧苗生长得整齐健旺。（翟其寅）
