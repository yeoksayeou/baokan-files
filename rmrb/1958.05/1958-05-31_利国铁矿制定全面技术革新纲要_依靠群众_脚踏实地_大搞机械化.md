Our Nanjing Dispatch from May 30th, reporter Zhang Jing reports: The CPC Xuzhou Ligou Iron Mine Committee has formulated a technological innovation outline, mobilizing the masses to develop the technological innovation movement in the direction of mechanization, striving for excellence, and determined to complete the production task of 600,000 tons of iron ore this year.

Ligou Iron Mine originally had simple equipment, and most of the production relied on manpower and manual operation. This year, it will be very difficult to complete a production task several times greater than last year without asking the higher authorities for equipment and funds. Therefore, two kinds of conservative ideas emerged among the cadres. One was not believing in the masses and not daring to break through the status quo, thinking that the foundation was poor, the equipment was old, and technological innovation was impossible. The other was being detached from reality and greedy for too much and too big, thinking that only creation and invention could solve the problem. The Party Committee promptly launched a debate among the cadres, criticizing these two ideas. In order to organize the masses to carry out technological innovation in a comprehensive and systematic way with leadership and planning, the Party Committee also adhered to the principles of spending less money, taking less time, achieving greater results, and being able to solve practical problems in a timely manner. It first conducted a comprehensive analysis and arrangement of production according to types of work and procedures, grasped the key points, identified the weak links in all aspects, formulated a comprehensive technological innovation outline, and then mobilized the masses to discuss and enrich it. The outline is divided into four categories: small-scale mechanization, promotion of advanced experience, tool improvement, and new technology research, which include seventy-two projects. The requirements, completion dates, designers, and promoters of each project are clearly specified in the outline. In particular, in the area of small-scale mechanization, it proposed twenty innovation projects such as endless rope remote control, endless rope transportation and automatic decoupling, and self-weight sliding cars, which will have a decisive effect on reducing physical labor, reducing labor force, and improving efficiency.

This technological innovation outline has played a great organizational role among the masses. After the mine's Party Committee put forward the slogan "Dare to innovate technology and march towards small-scale mechanization," Three Fields immediately proposed the heroic slogan "Diligence surpasses Wu Song, Wisdom surpasses Zhuge Liang; Ligou pit mouth achieves small-scale mechanization in three days." Within a few days, more than 55,900 rationalization proposals had been put forward among the masses, and more than 2,500 had been implemented. For example, Peng Guangying, a railway worker from Three Fields, proposed a "self-weight sliding car" method, which increased the efficiency of pushing cars by more than five times. Moreover, long-distance manual pushing of cars inside and outside the pit could be implemented. This method was welcomed by the car-pushing workers. They said, "Three days and nights of hard work, a lifetime of happiness." For example, electrician Zhang Ruiqin changed the water pump motor to an automatic switch and changed the endless rope to remote control, saving labor and improving work efficiency. Judging from the effects of eleven major reforms, preliminary calculations show that 139 people can be saved and the total production can be increased by 12.1%.

In order to ensure the realization of the outline, when carrying out major technological innovations, the leading cadres of the mine took specific leadership at the key breakthroughs, responsible for ideological mobilization, organizing forces, solving specific problems, and taking full responsibility. The secretaries and directors of each field also moved their offices to the pit mouth, taking turns on duty day and night. For example, when solving the key problem of small blasting volume, the Party Committee first consulted with Wu Yunfeng, an old technician from the Mobile Section, on how to trial-manufacture an impact drill to change small blasting into medium and large blasting. Under the encouragement of the Party Committee, Wu Yunfeng worked hard for five days and nights and finally succeeded in the trial production seven days ahead of schedule.

In the process of mobilizing the masses to implement the outline, a wave of comparison between people, between types of work, between groups, between fields, and between departments was launched throughout the mine. In the process of comparison, people visited and learned from wherever there were advanced practices. For example, after Three Fields visited One Field's overturning crane, they immediately promoted its use in Yangshan. The Mobile Section also organized fitters and lathe operators to go to other factories to learn, learned seven advanced experiences, and immediately adopted three of them after returning to the mine. They also improved two fixtures based on the principle of fast cutting in one of them, which solved the weak link in cutting air ducts. Some groups not only "picked up watermelons" in innovation, but also "swept sesame seeds." One lathe group put forward 860 rationalization proposals, and they themselves implemented 400 of them. Now they have put forward the goal of "marching towards 150,000 rationalization proposals."

### 利国铁矿制定全面技术革新纲要  依靠群众　脚踏实地　大搞机械化

    利国铁矿制定全面技术革新纲要
    依靠群众　脚踏实地　大搞机械化
    本报南京30日电　记者张竞报道：中共徐州利国铁矿委员会制订技术革新纲要，发动群众把技术革新运动向机械化的方向发展，力争上游，决心在今年完成六十万吨铁矿石的生产任务。
    利国铁矿本来设备简陋，大部分生产依靠人力和手工操作，今年要在不向上级要设备和资金的情况下完成比去年大好几倍的生产任务是有很大困难的。因此在干部中出现了两种保守思想，一种是不相信群众，不敢冲破现状，认为底子差、设备旧、革新技术不可能；另一种是脱离现实贪多求大，认为只有创造发明才解决问题。党委在干部中及时地展开了辩论，批判了这两种思想。为了有领导有计划地组织群众全面系统地进行技术革新，党委又本着花钱少、时间快、效果大、能及时解决现实问题的原则，先按工种、工序、进行生产上的全面分析排队，抓住关键，找出各方面的薄弱环节，制订出全面的技术革新纲要，再发动群众讨论充实。纲要分小型机械化、推广先进经验、工具改进、新技术研究等四类，四类中又包括七十二个项目。每个项目的要求、完成的日期、谁设计、谁推广，在纲要上都有明确规定。特别是在小型机械化方面提出了无极绳远距离操纵、无极绳运输和自动脱钩、自重溜车等二十个革新项目，对减轻体力劳动、减少劳动力、提高效率都有决定的作用。
    这个技术革新纲要在群众中起了很大的组织作用。矿党委提出“大胆革新技术、向小型机械化进军”的口号后，三场马上提出“干劲比武松，智慧胜孔明；利国坑口三天小型机械化”的英雄口号，几天之内，在群众中已提出五万五千九百多条合理化建议，并实现了二千五百多条。如三场铁道工人彭广营提出一条“自重溜车”法的建议，就使推车效率提高五倍以上。而且坑内外长途人力推车都能实行，这个办法受到了推车工人的欢迎。他们说：“苦干三昼夜，幸福一辈子”。又如电工张瑞勤把水泵马达改成自动开关，把无极绳改成远距离操纵；节省了人工，提高了劳动效率。从十一项较重大的改革的效果来看，初步计算可以节省一百三十九人，生产总量可提高12.1％。
    为了保证纲要的实现，在进行较重大的技术革新时，矿的领导干部都在关键突破口上作具体领导，负责进行思想发动，组织力量，解决具体问题，包干到底，各场的书记和主任也把办公室搬到坑口，昼夜轮流值班。如在解决爆破量少的关键问题时，党委首先和机动科的老技术工人吴云峰商量如何试造冲击钻，把小型爆破改为中、大型爆破。吴云峰在党委鼓动下，经过五昼夜苦战，终于提前七天试制成功。
    在发动群众实现纲要的过程中，全矿掀起了人比人、工种比工种、小组比小组、场比场、科室比科室的热潮。在比的过程中，哪里有先进就到哪里参观学习。如三场参观了一场的翻车吊杠后，回去马上就在羊山推广使用起来，机动科还组织钳工、车工到外厂去学习，学了七项先进经验，回矿马上就采用了三项。他们还根据其中的一项快速切削的原理，改进了两个卡具，解决了切削风管上的薄弱环节。有些小组在革新中不但“抱西瓜”，同时也“扫芝麻”，一个车工小组提了八百六十条合理化建议，自己就实现了四百条。现在他们又提出“向十五万条合理化建议进军”的奋斗目标。
