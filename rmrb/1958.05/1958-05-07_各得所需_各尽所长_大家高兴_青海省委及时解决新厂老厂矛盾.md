Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 6th – The Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, based on the principle of “overall planning and mutual collaboration,” has correctly handled the contradictions between new and old factories, transforming the competition for raw materials into mutual cooperation and support, thus forming the new and old factories into a unified whole.

Qinghai Province ranks third in the nation in terms of the number of livestock in its pastoral areas. In developing local industry, the pastoral prefectures and counties have prioritized establishing dairy processing plants because of the readily available milk source. However, this left the Kang'ersu Dairy Plant in Xining, which was established much earlier, without a milk source. Moreover, if each prefecture and county were to independently establish dairy plants, the quality would be difficult to guarantee due to limitations in equipment and technical expertise. This problem remained unresolved for a long time. Later, after repeated consultations among the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, various prefectures and counties, and the old factory – Kang'ersu Dairy Plant – the principle of "overall planning and mutual collaboration" was established. It was decided that prefectures and counties would universally set up semi-finished dairy product processing plants or stations, using flat-bottomed pans to concentrate the purchased fresh milk into semi-finished products, which would then be transported to the Xining Kang'ersu Dairy Plant for further processing into milk powder.

This approach has many benefits. First, flat-bottomed pan equipment is simple and easy to build, and plants can be moved with the nomadic grazing. Second, it greatly stimulates the enthusiasm of prefectures and counties in developing local industry. According to recent statistics, there are already more than 140 semi-finished dairy product processing plants (stations) that have been established or are being established in various prefectures and counties. These plants (stations) will produce more than 1,600 tons of semi-finished dairy products this year. Third, it solves the raw material problem for the Kang'ersu Dairy Plant and expands production. In 1957, the factory originally planned to produce ten tons of milk powder, but the task was not completed due to the milk source and transportation issues not being properly resolved. After more than 100 plants (stations) are established throughout the pastoral area, the factory's production will increase more than 100-fold. At the same time, since the milk is concentrated before being transported to Xining, it can save 60% of the vehicles, and further avoid milk spoilage and other losses during long-distance transportation.

    青海省委及时解决新厂老厂矛盾
    新华社西宁6日电　中共青海省委根据“统筹安排，互相协作”的原则，正确处理了新厂与老厂之间的矛盾，变互争原料为互相协作，互相支援，把新、老厂组成一个整体。
    青海省牧区的牲畜头数居全国第三位，牧区各州、县在发展地方工业中，因为奶源现成，首先考虑的是建立乳品加工厂。可是这样一来，很早就建立起来的西宁康尔素乳品厂就没有了奶源。同时，各个州、县若单独搞乳品厂，因设备和技术水平的限制，质量很难保证。这个问题，很长时间得不到妥善解决。后经中共青海省委与各州、县以及老厂——康尔素乳品厂反复进行协商，根据“统筹安排，互相协作”的原则，确定为州、县普遍设立乳品半成品加工厂或站，利用平底锅将收购的鲜奶进行浓缩，加工成半成品，运到西宁康尔素乳品厂再加工成奶粉。
    这样做的好处很多。第一、平底锅设备简便，建厂容易，并且可以随着放牧的游动而移动。第二、大大发挥了各州、县发展地方工业的积极性。据最近统计，各州、县已经建立和正在建立的乳品半成品加工厂（站），就有一百四十多个。这些厂（站）今年将生产一千六百多吨乳品的半成品。第三、解决了康尔素乳品厂的原料问题，扩大了生产。1957年这个厂原计划生产奶粉十吨，但因奶源问题和运输问题得不到很好的解决，没有完成任务。全牧区建立起一百多个厂（站）以后，这个厂的生产将提高一百多倍。同时，由于制成浓缩奶以后再往西宁运，可以节省下车辆60％，更避免了长途运输中的牛奶变质等损失。
