　　A Bicycle That Needs to Be Pushed

　　I am a worker. To make it easier to get to work, I saved more than one hundred yuan by skimping and saving for several months to buy a "Baishan" brand bicycle. Who knew that after only a little over a month, many parts became loose. After repairs, I managed to ride it for only a few days before the bottom bracket and rear axle failed to connect properly, and the large and small sprockets often failed to mesh. It was repaired several more times later, but it broke down again after a few days. I have had this bicycle for less than four months, but I have spent many days pushing it and carrying it. I really like bicycles, but now I am very annoyed. I hope the comrades in this factory will understand the consumers' troubles!　Shen Shoujin

　　要人推着走的自行车
    我是一个工人，为了上班方便，几个月前，曾省吃俭用积蓄了一百多元买了一辆“白山”牌自行车。那里知道到手一个多月，许多部件就松脱了。经过修理，凑合骑了不多几天，中轴和后轴交接不上，大齿与小齿常常衔接不起来。后来又修过几次，几天后又坏了。这辆车子买了不到四个月，我推着它走还扛着它走的日子却不少。我很喜爱自行车，现在却很厌烦。我希望这个工厂的同志体谅体谅消费者的苦恼吧！　沈寿金
