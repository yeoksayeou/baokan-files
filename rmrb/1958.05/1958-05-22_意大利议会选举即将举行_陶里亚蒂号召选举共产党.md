Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 20th: The elections for the Italian Chamber of Deputies and Senate will be held on May 25th, and the two-month election campaign is about to end.

In this election, 596 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 246 senators will be elected. The election of the Chamber of Deputies will be conducted according to a proportional representation system, that is, seats will be allocated according to the number of votes obtained by each party and political group. One member of the Chamber of Deputies will be elected for every 80,000 residents. The Senate election is somewhat different. Each of the twenty regions of Italy will elect a certain number of senators, with one senator elected for every 200,000 residents.

A total of 324 candidate lists have been submitted by various parties and political groups.

Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti issued a proclamation to voters, calling on them to vote for the Communist Party.

Togliatti pointed out that the characteristics of the current situation in Italy are poverty and unemployment domestically, and participation in the imperialist arms race and risky activities internationally. Togliatti said that to change this situation, the first thing to do is not to vote for the Christian Democratic Party, which is trying its best to win an absolute majority in parliament, thereby strengthening its political monopoly.

Togliatti then pointed out that voting for extreme right-wingers and liberals is worse than voting for clericals. As for the so-called non-religious small parties, such as the Republican Party, although they are now opposed to the Christian Democratic Party, they have been serving the Christian Democratic Party's anti-communism for many years.

    意大利议会选举即将举行
    陶里亚蒂号召选举共产党
    据新华社21日讯　塔斯社罗马20日讯：意大利众议院和参议院的选举将于5月25日举行，历时两个月的竞选运动即将结束。
    在这次选举中将选出五百九十六名众议员和二百四十六名参议员。众议院选举将按比例选举制进行，即根据各个政党和政治集团得票数目来分配席位。每八万居民中选一名众议员。参议院选举有些不同。意大利二十个区的每一区将选出一定数目的参议员，每二十万居民中选一名参议员。
    各个政党和政治集团一共提出了三百二十四份候选人名单。
    意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂发表了告选民书，号召选民投票选举共产党。
    陶里亚蒂指出，意大利当前局势的特征在国内方面是贫困和失业，在国际方面是参加了帝国主义居心险恶的军备竞赛和冒险活动。陶里亚蒂说，要改变这种情况，首先就不要投天主教民主党的票，这个党企图尽力在议会中争得绝对多数，从而加强它的政治垄断。
    陶里亚蒂接着指出，投极右翼分子和自由党人的票要比投教权派的票更糟糕。至于所谓非宗教小党派，例如共和党，虽然他们现在反对天主教民主党，但是许多年来它们一直在为天主教民主党的反共效劳。（附图片）
