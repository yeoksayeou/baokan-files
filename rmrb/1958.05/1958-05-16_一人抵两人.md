    One Person Does the Work of Two
    The Nantong Cinema's projection team only has three projectionists. Recently, due to many outside activities, the three people were too busy, so Comrade Bao Rangheng of the group suggested to the team leader, "I can operate both machines myself, and I guarantee there will be no accidents."
    Before the screening, Comrade Bao Rangheng made all the preparations: rewinding the film, placing the reels in order, installing the carbons, and wiping the machines clean. When the first machine finished projecting, he loaded the film onto the second machine and adjusted it as usual. In this way, he continuously screened two shows with good projection quality.
    Since that day, the Nantong Cinema's projection team has continued to operate with a single person. They have also preliminarily summarized their experience in single-person operation and are introducing it to other cinemas for promotion. Now, cinemas in Nantong City can all use single-person operation for projection.

    一人抵两人
    南通电影院机务组只有三个放映员。最近，因为外面活动多，三个人忙不了，于是该组保让衡同志就向组长提出“两部机子由我一个人操作好了，保证不出事故。”
    保让衡同志在放映前做好一切准备工作：把影片倒好，片本依次放好，炭精上好，机器栓擦好。开映时甲机放出后，乙机就上好片子，照常调机。这样有秩序的连放两场，放映质量良好。
    自从这天以后，南通电影院机务组到目前仍旧连续单人操作。他们并且初步总结试行单人操作的经验，向其它电影院介绍推广。现在南通市的电影院都能采用单人操作放映了。
