The key lies in liberating thought
Kong Sang

The East Gate Warehouse Wholesale Department of the Beijing Department Store Wholesale Company, breaking through the shackles of old ideas and old systems, has opened the door wide to retail units, abolished the contract supply system, and adopted a new method of "sample selection." This change is of great benefit to promoting the development of production and meeting the needs of the masses. This is a very meaningful reform in the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in the commercial wholesale sector.

The distribution system of supply contracts for daily industrial products was necessary under the conditions where the socialist transformation had not yet been completed. However, even in the past, this distribution system was not without its shortcomings. Especially after the change in the ownership of the means of production, this form of distribution became increasingly unable to meet the needs of the new situation. The main problem was that the plan was too rigidly restricted, and the concentration was too excessive. It could not adapt to the extreme variability of consumer demand for daily supplies and free selection. As a result, abnormal phenomena such as "sweatshirts arriving in autumn and woolen clothes arriving in winter" and stockpiles in one place and shortages in another often occurred. After the East Gate Warehouse Wholesale Department switched to the "sample selection" distribution method, these contradictions were resolved. In our lives, we often encounter this phenomenon: some unreasonable things cannot be changed for a long time, not because the things are particularly complicated, but mainly because people's minds are shackled by old things and dominated by old habits. Therefore, they are always willing to do things in an orderly manner and dare not jump out of the original circle to consider problems from a broader perspective. It seems that those old things are as heavy as mountains, and it seems that old things can never be changed. From the perspective of methodology, this is a metaphysical reflection. However, the comrades of the East Gate Warehouse Wholesale Department adopted a completely different attitude. They broke through the shackles of old ideas, dared to boldly mobilize the masses to break with old conventions, and dared to boldly put forward new tasks to promote the Great Leap Forward in the socialist construction cause. Because their thinking has already caught up, they have a clear banner, are full of energy, and can overcome all difficulties. The experience of the East Gate Warehouse once again vividly proves that ideological liberation is a huge driving force for promoting the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction cause.

In the past few years, a large part of the rules and regulations formulated and implemented by the commercial sector have played a positive role in socialist transformation and socialist construction. This must be affirmed. However, some of them were originally correct, but after the situation changed, especially after the basic completion of the three major transformations and the development of production, they are no longer applicable; there are also some rules and regulations that were not reasonable enough originally, and they have become even more unreasonable after the situation has changed. Timely and reasonable rules and regulations can encourage the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of the masses and promote the development of production; conversely, they will restrict the enthusiasm of the masses and hinder the development of production. Therefore, we must pay close attention to the changes in objective circumstances and promptly revise those outdated and unreasonable rules and regulations to make them better serve the socialist construction cause. Of course, the problems involved in some of the existing contradictions in commercial work are very complicated, but the initiative of people is very great. Since people can formulate rules and regulations, why can't they change them according to the changes in the situation? The key lies in liberating thought. This is the biggest inspiration the experience of the East Gate Warehouse Wholesale Department gives us.

    关键在于解放思想
    孔桑
    北京市百货批发公司东门仓批发部冲破旧思想旧制度的束缚，向零售单位大开方便之门，废除了合同供应制度，采取了“看样选购”的新方法。这个改变，对于促进生产的发展和满足群众的需要都有很大好处。这是商业批发部门在全民大跃进的新形势下的一项很有意义的改革。
    对日用工业品采取供应合同的分配制度，在社会主义改造尚未完成的条件下是必要的，但即使在过去这种分配制度也并不是没有缺点的，特别是在生产资料所有制改变以后，这种分配形式就愈来愈不能适应新情况的需要了，主要是计划限制过死，集中过多，不能适应于消费者对日用供应品需求的极大变化性和自由选购，结果是常常出现“秋来汗衫到、冬去绒衣来”以及此处积压、彼处脱销的不正常现象。东门仓批发部改行“看样选购”的分配方法以后，这些矛盾就都解决了。在我们的生活中常常有这种现象：一些不合理的事情，长时期得不到改变，原因并不是事情特别复杂，而主要是人们的思想被陈旧的东西束缚住了，被旧的习惯势力所左右了，因此总愿意按部就班地做事情，而不敢跳出原来的圈子，从更宽阔的方面去考虑问题。似乎那些陈旧的东西像山一样地沉重，似乎旧事物永远也不能改变。从思想方法上来看，这是一种形而上学的反映。东门仓批发部的同志们却采取了截然不同的态度。他们冲破了旧思想的束缚，敢于放手发动群众打破陈规，敢于大胆地提出新任务，促进社会主义建设事业的跃进。由于他们的思想已经赶上前去，所以旗帜鲜明，干劲十足，一切困难都能够克服。东门仓的经验，再一次生动地证明：思想解放是推动我国社会主义建设事业大跃进的巨大动力。
    几年来，商业部门制定和实施的规章制度，有很大一部分对于社会主义改造和社会主义建设起了积极的作用。这是必须加以肯定的。但是，其中也有一部分原来是正确的，但在情况发生变化以后、特别是在三大改造基本完成和生产发展以后，已经不适用了；也有一些规章制度原来就不够合理，情况发生变化以后，就更加不合理了。适时的、合理的规章制度，可以使群众的革命积极性和创造精神得到鼓舞，促进生产的发展；反之则束缚了群众的积极性和阻碍了生产的发展。因此我们必须十分注意客观情况的变化，及时地修改那些过了时的、不合理的规章制度，使它们更好地为社会主义建设事业服务。当然，商业工作中现存的一些矛盾所涉及的问题是十分复杂的，但是，人的能动性是很大的，人既然能够制定规章制度，为什么就不能根据情况的变化来改变它呢？关键在于解放思想。这就是东门仓批发部的经验给我们的最大的启发。
