Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: (Reporter Zhou Yongkang) Shanghai's light industry, regarded as a competitive target by local industries across the country, is now taking a leap forward to reach new heights.

This year, the overall picture of Shanghai's light industry development is: advanced new products are emerging like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, dazzling to the eye; the quality of existing products is rapidly improving, with some catching up to the standards of advanced regions in China, and some reaching international levels; and in accordance with the principle of reasonable division of labor with the interior, ordinary products are being left for the interior to develop. In the first five months of this year, more than 200 new varieties and designs have been successfully trial-produced, including more than 30 kinds of high-end products such as cameras, high-grade sewing machines, and acid-resistant enamelware, some of which have already been put into production. Eleven major products, including enamel basins, alarm clocks, and flashlights, which were originally of inferior quality to those produced in other regions, have now caught up with the levels of Xi'an, Tianjin, Yantai, and other places. The quality of more than 70 products, including canned food, photographic plate paper, and spices, has reached international levels, either completely or partially. In these five months, the output of high-end products such as bicycles, sewing machines, clocks, calculators, and fountain pens has increased by an average of about 40% compared with the same period last year. The proportion of high-end products in the city's light industry is constantly rising. Thirty-three kinds of ordinary daily necessities, such as printing machines, lampshades, wooden clipboards, and triangular shoe tacks, which are relatively easy to manufacture and have already been developed to a considerable extent in the interior, have been gradually reduced to only 10% to 20% of last year's output in the first five months of this year, with the rest being left for the interior to produce. Due to the expansion of high-end product production, the output value in the first five months of this year still increased by about 10% compared with the same period last year.

Resolutely breaking down complacency and conscientiously improving technical levels are important foundations for Shanghai's light industry to reach new heights. On April 14, the Shanghai Municipal Light Industry Bureau convened a city-wide light industry factory technical work leap forward conference, calling on the city's 200,000 light industry workers to further strengthen technical research work, trial-produce more new products, and continuously improve old products. At the same time, it focused on criticizing the complacent mindset in Shanghai's light industry factories. Many products in Shanghai used to be famous throughout the country for their quality, but they did not improve rapidly enough, with the result that the quality of some products has fallen behind other regions in recent years. This meeting criticized the old-fashioned complacency and sounded an alarm for all employees.

After this meeting, the 19 professional light industry companies in Shanghai immediately established 142 technical research groups, combining the ranking of old products with the planning of new products, examining and criticizing the "Greater Shanghai" and "Big Brother" mentality, collecting technical data and physical samples of products from home and abroad, conducting analysis and dissection, and carrying out comparative evaluations. They are determined to work hard for a year to bring 42 products with quality inferior to those produced in other regions up to the advanced levels of more than 20 provinces and cities. Most professional companies also sent a large number of personnel to other places to visit and learn on the spot, changing their past attitude of only teaching and not learning when exchanging experiences, and humbly learning from the slightest experience of their counterparts in other places. After the Shanghai Enamel Industry Company organized people from various factories to learn from Xi'an, Changchun, Tianjin, and other places, the quality of its products improved by leaps and bounds. At present, the enamel products produced by Shanghai's five major enamel factories, including Huafeng, Yifeng, and Shunfeng, have all caught up with and surpassed Xi'an, which has been in the leading position in the country in terms of enamel product quality in recent years, in terms of gloss, acid resistance, heat resistance, and adhesion. Some paper mills have sent people to Tianjin to learn advanced methods of round-net machines. Not only has the speed of the machines increased compared with the past, but also the quality of the paper has improved.

To adapt to the current situation of the great leap forward in local industry and Shanghai's policy of developing towards high-end precision products, 14 major light industrial sectors in Shanghai are currently carrying out comprehensive streamlining, merging, and restructuring in a planned and step-by-step manner. So far this year, more than 1,500 light industrial factories have been converted to other industries and merged. Some factories that used to produce soap are now producing electric clocks; some match factories have now become plastic processing factories. Many factories that used to produce mimeographs and carbon paper are also actively carrying out the reconstruction and adjustment of factory buildings and equipment, and will soon become specialized factories for cameras and photographic film. One hundred and ninety-six electroplating factories are gradually being merged with corresponding factories according to their original processing relationships, becoming electroplating workshops for those factories, specializing in serving the production of high-end products. After 196 bicycle and sewing machine parts manufacturing plants were merged with five large plants for production, the past situation of decentralized management and backward technology was changed. The parts produced are also gradually developing towards standardization due to the unified technical management of each plant, so that they can be interchanged and the quality can be further improved. After such streamlining, merging, and restructuring, the output of these two products in Shanghai will increase by more than 100% this year.

In the upsurge of various places launching competitions with Shanghai, more than 4,000 people from more than 2,000 units in more than 20 provinces and cities have come to Shanghai to exchange experiences with their counterparts. They launched an unprecedented large-scale exchange of experiences in various factories. After criticizing the departmentalism of technical secrecy in the rectification and anti-rightist movements, many factory cadres now clearly see that Shanghai cannot only rely on high-end products to meet the needs of the whole country in the future, but it is equally important to help various places develop local industries from a technical point of view, so as to better play the role of the old industrial base. The enamel, bicycle, printing, and other industries are now sorting out the manufacturing methods, economic indicators, and technical innovation data of various products in their factories, and are ready for factories from other places to request and exchange information at any time. Technical personnel in various industries are currently studying how to give full play to collective strength, shorten the trial-production process of new products and the time they are put into production, so as to adapt to the current situation of the great leap forward.

    上海轻工业产品越来越好
    据新华社讯　记者周永康报道：被全国地方工业视为竞赛目标的上海轻工业，现在正跃步登高，更上一层楼。
    今年以来，上海轻工业的发展概貌是：高级新产品犹如雨后春笋，琳琅满目；原来的产品，质量迅速提高，有的赶上了国内先进地区的指标，有的已经达到了国际水平；根据同内地合理分工的原则，普通产品让给了内地去发展。今年头五个月中，试制成功的新品种新花式共有两百多种，其中高级产品如照相机、高级平车、耐酸搪瓷等有三十多种，部分已经投入生产。搪瓷面盆、闹钟、手电筒等十一种原来质量不如外地的主要产品，现在都迎头赶上了西安、天津、烟台等地的水平。罐头食品、照相版纸、香料等七十多种产品的质量，已经全部或部分的达到了国际水平。这五个月中，自行车、缝纫机、钟表、计算机、金笔等高级产品的产量比去年同期平均增长四成左右。高级产品在全市轻工业中的比重正在不断上升。比较容易制造而且过去内地已有相当发展的打印机、灯罩、木板夹、三角鞋钉等三十三种普通日用品，今年头五个月中，已经逐步压缩到只及去年产量的10％到20％，其余让内地去生产。由于高级产品生产的扩大，今年头五个月的产值仍然比去年同期增长了10％左右。
    坚决打破骄傲自满思想，认真提高技术水平，是上海轻工业更上一层楼的重要基础。4月14日，上海市轻工业局召开了全市轻工业工厂的技术工作跃进大会，号召全市二十万轻工业职工进一步加强技术研究工作，试制更多的新产品，不断改进老产品。同时着重批判了上海轻工业工厂中的骄傲自满思想。上海有许多产品过去质量闻名全国，但是没有很快提高，以致近年来有些产品质量反落在外地的后面。这次会议批判了老大自满思想，给全市职工敲起了警钟。
    这次会议以后，上海十九个轻工业专业公司立即成立了一百四十二个技术研究小组，结合了老产品的排队和新产品的规划，检查和批判了“大上海”、“老大哥”的思想，收集国内外产品的技术资料、实物样品，进行分析解剖、对口评比，决心苦战一年，把四十二种质量不如外地的产品，赶上二十多个省市的先进水平。大部分专业公司还派出了大批人员到外地去实地参观学习，改变了过去出去交流经验只教不学的态度，虚心学习外地同行的滴点经验。上海搪瓷工业公司组织各厂派人到西安、长春、天津等地去学习以后，产品质量有了飞跃提高。目前，上海华丰、益丰、顺风等五个主要搪瓷工厂生产的搪瓷品，在光泽、耐酸、耐热、密着力等方面，已经全部赶上和超过了近年来搪瓷品质量居全国首位的西安。有些造纸厂派人去天津学习了圆网机的先进方法以后，不但车速比过去加快，纸张质量也有了提高。
    适应当前地方工业大跃进的形势和上海向高级精密产品方向发展的方针，上海十四个主要轻工业行业目前正在有计划有步骤地进行全面的裁并改组。今年到目前为止，已有一千五百多个轻工业工厂实行转业改行和合并。有些原来生产香皂的工厂现在在生产电钟；有些火柴厂现在已成为塑料品的加工厂。还有许多原来生产速印机、复写纸的工厂，也在积极进行厂房设备的改建调整工作，不久即将成为照相机和照相软片的专业工厂。几十个电镀厂按原来和别的工厂的加工关系，正在陆续对口合并，成为那些工厂的电镀车间，专为生产高级产品服务。一百九十六个自行车、缝纫机零件制造厂，和五家大厂合并生产后，改变了过去经营分散、技术落后的状况，生产的部件也因为各厂技术管理的统一，逐步向标准化的方向发展，做到能够互相换用，进一步提高质量。经过这样的裁并改组，上海这两种产品的产量，今年将要提高一倍以上。
    在各地向上海展开竞赛的热潮中，今年以来，先后有二十多个省市二千多个单位四千多人，到上海来跟同行交流经验。他们在各厂展开了空前规模的经验大交流。许多工厂的干部在整风和双反运动中批判了技术保密的本位主义思想以后，现在都清楚地看到，上海今后不能光靠高级产品来满足全国需要，同样重要的是要从技术上来帮助各地发展地方工业，这样才能更好地发挥老工业基地的作用。搪瓷、自行车、印刷等行业，现在都在整理本厂各种产品的制造方法、经济指标和技术革新的技术资料，随时准备着外地工厂来索取和交流。各行业技术人员目前还在研究怎样发挥集体力量，缩短新产品的试制过程和它们投入生产的时间，以适应当前大跃进的形势。
