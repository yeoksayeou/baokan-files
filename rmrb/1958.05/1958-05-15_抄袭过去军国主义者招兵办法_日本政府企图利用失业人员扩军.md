Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: According to TASS, Tokyo, unemployment is increasing in Japan due to the economic recession. Even according to official materials, the number of unemployed has reached 850,000. According to newspaper reports, the Japanese ruling group is not only failing to take urgent measures to eliminate unemployment, but is also attempting to use the unemployed to expand the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces."

    A letter from an unemployed person published in the Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" has attracted attention. The writer said that after a long and fruitless search for work, he recently received a notice from the employment agency suggesting that he might be able to get a job. However, he and his friends were surprised and angered to find that they were not meeting with company representatives at the employment agency, but with an officer from the "Defense Agency." The unemployed were given a two-hour lecture on the "superiority" of joining the military, and then asked to fill out forms. The unemployed wrote that this method was very similar to the methods used by militarists in the past to recruit soldiers.

    抄袭过去军国主义者招兵办法
　　日本政府企图利用失业人员扩军
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社东京13日讯：由于经济衰退，日本的失业现象正在日益加剧。即使根据官方材料，失业人数也已经达到八十五万人。据报刊消息看来，日本统治集团不仅不去采取紧急措施来消灭失业现象，反而企图利用失业人员来扩大日本“自卫队”。
    日本“读卖新闻”上刊登的一位失业者的信件，已经引起人们的注意。写信人说，经过长期徒劳地寻找工作以后，他不久以前才得到职业介绍所的通知，暗示他有可能得到工作。可是，他和他的朋友在职业介绍所会见的却不是公司的代表，而是一位“防卫厅”的军官，他们当时感到十分惊奇和愤怒。失业者们听了两小时的关于参加军队的“优越性”的演讲，然后便请他们填表。这位失业者写道，这种方法很像过去军国主义者招兵的方法。
