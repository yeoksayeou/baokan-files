Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 19th. To rapidly improve the quality of light industrial products, the light industry leadership departments of Tianjin and Shanghai recently held a meeting in Shanghai and signed the "Tianjin Shanghai Light Industry Technical Mutual Aid and Cooperation Contract." The two cities will further strengthen technical cooperation to promote the rapid catching up with and surpassing of international levels in the quality of major light industrial products.

The cooperation contract stipulates that, based on the sixty-one products proposed by both parties, samples from the end of the previous quarter, production costs, consumption quotas, and quality standards, as well as significant technological innovations and technical organizational measures adopted, will be exchanged on a factory-to-factory basis in the first month of each quarter. Scientific and technological research plans and technical data for new products will be exchanged at any time.

The contract stipulates that both parties will help each other solve major technical problems by sending people to the other party for internships or inviting the other party to provide technical guidance. According to preliminary arrangements, from June to August this year, Tianjin's oils and fats soap, cultural and educational supplies, glass, and food industries will send workers to twenty-six factories in Shanghai's corresponding industries to learn production techniques. Shanghai's thermos bottle and leather industries will send technicians to Tianjin to help solve problems such as thermos bottle bottom sealing and leather coat quality. Next year, Shanghai will train thirty plastic model workers for Tianjin.

The Shanghai Light Industry Bureau is also preparing to send a group of people to Tianjin in early next month to learn from Tianjin's advanced technology and experience, and has proposed specific projects for which Shanghai requests Tianjin's assistance.

    新华社上海19日电　天津和上海的轻工业领导部门最近在上海召开会议，签订了“天津上海轻工业技术互助协作合同”。两地将进一步加强技术协作，推动主要轻工业产品在质量上迅速赶上和超过国际水平。
    协作合同中规定：根据双方提出的六十一种产品，按工厂对口，在每个季度的第一个月交换上个季度末的样品、生产成本、消耗定额、质量标准，以及所采取的重大的技术革新和技术组织措施；平时随时交换双方的科学技术研究规划和新产品的技术资料。
    合同中规定双方互相帮助解决重大技术问题，派人到对方实习或邀请对方进行技术指导。根据初步安排，今年6月到8月，天津的油脂肥皂、文教用品、玻璃、食品等行业，将分别派工人到上海同业的二十六个工厂去学习生产技术。上海热水瓶、皮革行业将派出技术人员到天津去帮助解决热水瓶拉底封口、皮大衣质量等问题。明年，上海将为天津培养三十个塑料模型工人。
    上海轻工业局也准备在下个月初派一批人到天津去学习天津的先进技术经验，并且提出上海方面要求天津协助的具体项目。
