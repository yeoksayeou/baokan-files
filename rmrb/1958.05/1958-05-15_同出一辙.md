A Note
    The economic crisis in the United States is the inevitable result of the development of the inherent contradictions of American capitalist society. However, officials in Washington are determined to conceal the truth and spread various kinds of slander. Recently, U.S. Secretary of Commerce Weeks even fantastically claimed that the U.S. economic crisis was caused by the launch of Soviet artificial satellites last fall. His argument is that the Soviet satellites made Americans nervous and lose confidence, thus causing the outbreak of the economic crisis.
    These absurd words of Weeks remind people of the past. In 1930, Stalin mentioned at the 16th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party that an American industrialist named Lechbere, attributed the outbreak of the world economic crisis in 1929 to "Bolshevik conspiracies."
    Although nearly thirty years have passed, such nonsense is cut from the same cloth. It is enough to prove that the words of the figures in the American ruling group, like the economic crisis, have become periodic.

    同出一辙
    美国的经济危机是美国资本主义社会内在矛盾发展的必然结果。但是华盛顿的官员们却偏要掩饰真相，散播各种谰言。最近美国商务部长威克斯更异想天开地说，美国经济危机是去年秋天苏联发射人造卫星引起的。其论据是：苏联的卫星使美国人神经紧张、失掉信心，于是就造成了经济危机的爆发。
    威克斯这些胡话使人忆起了往事，1930年斯大林在联共第十六次代表大会上曾提到一位美国工业家列赫别尔格说过的话，他竟把1929年的世界经济危机的爆发，归因于“布尔什维克的阴谋诡计”。
    事情虽已相隔近三十年，而这类胡话却同出一辙。足证美国统治集团人物的言词也同经济危机一样成了周期性的了。
