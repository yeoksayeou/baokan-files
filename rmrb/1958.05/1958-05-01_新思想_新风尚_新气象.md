    A Night to Remember
    Not long ago, a moving story occurred in a small factory in Shanghai, the Hez众 (Hezhong) Electrical Equipment Factory on Beijing West Road. One evening, more than a hundred workers gathered in the workshop after work, writing big-character posters in twos and threes. More than three thousand big-character posters for the "Double-Anti" (anti-waste and anti-conservatism) campaign had already been written, exposing a lot of waste and conservatism in production. But the workers were still reluctant to go home. It turned out that there was still something churning in their hearts, and that was the issue of unity among the workers. This was an old problem left over from history, and many people in the factory were troubled by it. Lin Dingxing, the leader of the fitter group, and Wu Meigen, another veteran worker, hadn't spoken to each other for almost several years. Cao Rong, the leader of the production planning group, and Xie Shengcang, the head of the finance group, worked in the same factory, but they acted like strangers when they met.
    Many people were thinking about this matter. Cao Rong had already silently written a big-character poster, proposing to reconcile with Xie Shengcang. Old worker Lin Dingxing also wrote a big-character poster, saying, "It was my fault that I was not united with Wu Meigen in the past." The big-character poster was sent to Dong Shenfu, the secretary of the Party branch. It just so happened that this young man was also considering this matter. When he received the big-character poster, he was so happy that he immediately ran to the loudspeaker and announced the good news loudly, asking everyone to learn from them. Before he finished speaking, the workshop was instantly boiling. The workers could no longer restrain their enthusiasm. Some immediately wrote big-character posters, and some ran to reconcile with each other. Cao Rong and Xie Shengcang, two "enemies" who had not spoken for several years, embraced each other warmly with tears. Wu Meigen and Lin Dingxing, two old workers, shook hands tightly, vying to say "It was my fault in the past," reviewing their mistakes and asking to reconcile with each other. A hundred big-character posters were written all at once, and people lined up to send them to the Party branch.
    In the workshop, more than twenty pairs of workers who had quarreled in the past were holding reconciliation talks. Worker Xi Junfan was so moved that he couldn't speak. He suddenly squeezed to the loudspeaker and sang the song "Unity is Strength". In an instant, all the workers in the hall followed him and sang excitedly.
    Director Cai Goes Down to the Workshop
    Not long after the leading cadres of the Taiyuan Woolen Mill implemented the system of following the shifts for labor, when Director Cai Zhiyun appeared in front of everyone, the workers looked at this "stranger" in a light blue work uniform in surprise and shouted: "Director Cai is really coming down this time!"
    That day, Director Cai convened engineering and technical personnel and workers to study the improvement of the wool blending machine, which had not been resolved for a long time, and formulated technical measures based on the opinions stated by veteran worker Ma Liang and others. Director Cai continued to follow the shifts for labor for several days, working with the workers to improve the wool blending machine. As a result, the production and quality of the wool blending machine exceeded any previous period, and the wool loss rate was reduced from 2% to 0.5%, saving more than 150 kilograms of pure wool per month. Comrade Cai Zhiyun said meaningfully: "Now I truly understand the significance of going deep among the masses and working with the workers."
    Secretary Yang's Transformation
    The peasants of Shilin Township, Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, posted many big-character posters to Yang Jinpei, the secretary of the Party general branch, criticizing him for only making arrangements and appeals, not doing specific work, and being a "big cannon secretary, subjective secretary."
    Yang Jinpei thought about it day and night, repeatedly considering the criticisms of the masses, and felt that they were all correct. Therefore, he was determined to change resolutely. In the past, he often walked around the fields wearing a coat and cloth shoes; now he wears homespun clothes and straw sandals and labors with the commune members. In order to launch a high tide of manure accumulation, on a cold winter night, regardless of the strong wind, darkness, and severe cold, he supported a boat from the Mei Er Cooperative and scooped river mud. He went out at eight o'clock in the evening and scooped four boats of river mud in a row, returning until four o'clock the next morning. This matter spread immediately. The secretary and director of the Mei Er Cooperative also followed suit, leading the commune members to actively engage in the manure accumulation movement. Just at this moment, the Mei Hu San Cooperative transported back three double-shared plows, but no one was willing to learn how to use them, saying that this thing was impossible to learn. Yang Jinpei decided to go to the Lingjiang Cooperative to learn. Relying on his strong will, once, twice, three times... one day, two days, three days, he finally learned to use the double-shared plow. The commune members all said: "Our Secretary Yang has indeed become better!"
    Wholeheartedly for the Public
    In the "Destroy Capitalism and Promote Proletarian Ideology" exhibition held in the Beishi District Outpatient Department of Shenyang City, a commentator pointed to many instruments and medicines and said to the visitors: "These things are what I used to open an underground clinic at home." Then he added: From now on, I will kick it away completely, and I will wholeheartedly work in the joint clinic." He said it so happily and resolutely. Who is this commentator? He is Liu Lianjie, an internal medicine doctor at the Beishi District Outpatient Department.
    In 1950, Liu Lianjie joined the joint clinic, but he disliked the low income. When someone came to him for medical treatment, he did not refer them to the hospital, but diagnosed them himself. Thus, the "underground clinic" began at this time. Moreover, when seeing patients at the joint clinic, he was always in a hurry and sloppy, but when seeing patients at his own home, he was very serious and responsible. In this way, his "underground clinic" was maintained for six years.
    The Double-Anti Movement began, and the sound of the Great Leap Forward spread to his ears from all directions. He thought: Everyone else is leaping forward and asking to give their hearts to the Party, but what about me? I am still walking on the road of capitalism. If I don't confess, how can I leap forward? How can I be worthy of the Party? After a fierce ideological struggle, he finally brought out his "underground clinic" and frankly confessed to the Party and comrades.
    No Longer Be a "Special Party Member"
    During the "Double-Anti" Movement, a big-character poster with the title "Eradicate This Official Style and Unhealthy Trend from the Organization" appeared in the center of the Transportation Department Building in Henan Province, criticizing Deputy Director Yuan Chunfang as a "special Party member." It wrote: He often does not participate in Party group meetings. According to comrades' recollections, in 1957, he attended group life no more than three times. If someone notified him to attend a Party group meeting, he would reply with the demeanor of a leader: "I have something to do."
    As soon as this big-character poster with the red title was posted, it immediately attracted Yuan Chunfang's attention. He immediately expressed his willingness to seriously correct his mistakes. Two days later, the Party group leader notified him to attend a group meeting, and he was the first to arrive. Originally, the Provincial People's Committee sent him a red ticket that night, asking him to attend the shadow puppet performance and evaluation gala. He said: "Tonight is a Party group meeting, so I can't go to the theater." He also said: In the future, I must get rid of the hat of "special Party member." (Attached picture)
    ——Are these dedicated to the country?
    ——Yes, and me too.
    He said: Tonight is a Party group meeting, so I can't go to the theater!

    新思想·新风尚·新气象
    难忘的夜晚
    不久前，在上海市北京西路的一家小型工厂——合众电工器材厂里，发生了一个动人的故事。一个晚上，一百多个下了班的工人都聚集在工场里，三三两两地分头写大字报，“双反”的大字报已写了三千多张，揭露了许多生产上的浪费和保守，可是工人们仍然不肯回家去，原来，他们的心上还有一件事在翻腾，这就是职工之间的团结问题。这是一个历史上遗留下来的老疙瘩，厂里有不少人都被这个疙瘩苦恼着。钳工组组长林丁兴和吴梅根这两个老工人，差不多已有好几年见面不说话了。生产计划组组长曹融和财务组长谢声沧，虽则同在一个厂里工作，可是见了面却像路人一样。
    许多人都在想着这件事。曹融却已不声不响写了张大字报，提出要和谢声沧和好。老工人林丁兴也写了张大字报，说“过去和吴梅根不团结，是怪我不好”。大字报送到党支部书记董申甫手里，刚巧这个青年人也正在考虑这件事，当他一拿到大字报，高兴得立即奔到扩音机前，大声地报告喜讯，要大家向他们学习。他的话还未说完，工场里顿时沸腾了，工人们已再也按捺不住满腔热情，有的立即写大字报，有的跑去找对方和好，曹融和谢声沧这两个已几年不说话的“仇人”流着泪热烈地拥抱着。吴梅根和林丁兴这两个老工人紧紧地握着手，抢着说“过去是我错”检讨自己，要求与对方和好的大字报一下子就写出了一百张，人们排着队争先恐后地送到党支部去。
    工场里，有二十多对过去闹别扭的工人在进行着和好的谈话。工人席俊范被感动得说不出话来，一个人突然挤到扩音器前唱起了“团结就是力量”的歌子，一霎时，全场工人都跟着他激动地唱了起来。
    蔡厂长下了车间
    太原毛织厂领导干部实行跟班劳动以后不久，厂长蔡志云出现在大家面前的时候，工人们出奇地瞧了瞧这位身穿浅蓝色工作服的“陌生”人，就七嘴八舌地叫喊起来：“蔡厂长这回真下来啦！”
    当天，蔡厂长就召集工程技术人员和工人一起研究了长期没有解决的和毛机的改进问题，并且根据老工人马良等申述的意见，制订了技术措施。蔡厂长又接连不断跟班劳动了好几天，和工人一起努力改进了和毛机。结果，和毛机的产、质量超过了以往任何时期，羊毛损耗率也从2％降低到0.5％，每月可节省一百五十多公斤纯羊毛。蔡志云同志意味深长地说：“这下我才真正懂得了深入群众，和工人一起劳动的意义。”
    杨书记的转变
    浙江省绍兴县狮林乡的农民给党总支书记杨金培贴了好多张大字报，批评他只作布置、号召，不作具体工作，是个“大炮书记、主观书记”。
    杨金培日思夜想，反复地考虑了群众对自己的批评，感到都是正确的。于是，他下定决心坚决地改。过去，他常穿着大衣、布鞋在田头上走来走去；现在穿着土布衣服草鞋和社员一起劳动。为了掀起积肥的高潮，在一个寒冬的夜里，他不管风大、天黑、严寒，从梅二社撑了一条船捻河泥去了。晚上八点钟出门，一连捻了四船河泥，直到第二天早晨四点钟才回来。这件事一下就传开了，梅二社的支部书记、社主任等也跟着行动起来，带领社员积极地投入了积肥运动。正在这当儿，梅湖三社运回了三部双铧犁，但是没有人肯学使用方法，都说这个东西是学不会的。杨金培就决定到岭江社去学习。他凭着自己坚强的意志，一次、二次、三次……，一天、二天、三天，终于学会了使用双铧犁。社员都讲：“我们的杨书记确实变好了！”
    一心为公
    在沈阳市北市区门诊部举办的“灭资兴无”展览会里，一个说明员指着许多器械和药品对参观的人说：“这些东西，就是我在家开地下诊所用的。”接着他还说：从今以后，我一脚把它踢开，要全心全意在联合诊所工作，他说得那样畅快和坚决。这位说明员是谁呢？他就是北市区门诊部的内科大夫刘廉洁。
    1950年，刘廉洁参加了联合诊所，但是他嫌收入少，有人来找他看病，他不往医院介绍，就自己诊断。于是“地下诊所”便从这时开始了，而且在联合诊所看病，总是匆匆忙忙，马马虎虎，在自己家里看病则十分认真十分负责。这样，他的“地下诊所”一直保留了六年。
    双反运动开始了，跃进声从四面八方传到他的耳里。他想：人家都在跃进，要求把心交给党，而我呢？还在往资本主义的道上走，如果不谈，那怎么能跃进呢？怎能对得起党呢？经过思想上的激烈斗争，他终于把自己的“地下诊所”端出来了，坦率地向党和同志们交了心。
    不再当“特殊党员”
    “双反”运动中，河南省交通厅大楼的中央出现了一张“从组织上打掉这种官风邪气”的大字报，批评副厅长苑春芳是“特殊党员”。上面写着：他经常不参加党的小组会议。据同志们回忆，1957年他最多只过了三次小组生活。如果有人通知他参加党的小组会议，他即以首长的风度答曰：“我有事”。
    这张用红字作标题的大字报刚一贴出，立即引起了苑春芳的注意。他立即表示要认真改正自己的错误。两天以后，党小组长通知他开小组会议，第一名到会的就是他。本来，这天晚上省人委给他送来了一张红票，要他参加皮影观摩评比晚会。他说：“今晚是党的小组会议，可不去看戏。”他还表示：今后一定要去掉“特殊党员”的帽子。（附图片）
    ——这些是献给国家的吗？
    ——是，还有我。
    他说：今晚开党小组会，可不去看戏！
