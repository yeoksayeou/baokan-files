Meticulously Managed Tea Fields, Nine Thousand People Picking in Season
"Mingqian" Tea Sees Unprecedented Production Increase

(Our report) The famous Longjing "Mingqian" tea has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. On April 4th and 5th, during the Qingming Festival, a total of 1,186 jin of "Mingqian" tea leaves were picked and processed; the quantity and quality were unmatched in any previous period in history.

"Mingqian" tea has always been picked before the Qingming Festival, hence the name. During the Qingming season in Jiangnan, the weather is not yet very warm, and there are very few tea buds, so "Mingqian" tea is rare. In old China, only a few jin of genuine "Mingqian" Longjing tea could be harvested in a year.

According to records, picking tea on Qingming Day requires 7,664 tender buds for one jin of raw tea leaves, and 4.5 jin of tender buds are needed to fry one jin of "Mingqian" tea; while a skilled tea-picking woman can only pick about twelve liang of tender buds a day. This shows how precious "Mingqian" tea is.

This year's ability to achieve such a large harvest of "Mingqian" tea is directly related to the nationwide Great Leap Forward that began last winter. The Longjing tea area carried out unprecedented cold protection and cultivation work last winter and this spring, applying fertilizer in quantities several times greater than in previous years. In addition, in terms of labor, this year's picking received strong support from neighboring counties from the very beginning. In addition to the Longjing area's own 3,000 laborers who were all invested in tea picking and processing, Xiaoshan and Hangxian provided 6,000 people daily to support tea picking. With these abundant laborers, it was truly possible to meet the requirements of picking tender buds, picking quickly, picking a lot, and picking well, without letting a single tender bud grow old on the tree.

### 精心管理茶田　九千人适时采摘  “明前”茶空前增产

    精心管理茶田　九千人适时采摘
    “明前”茶空前增产
    本报讯　著名龙井“明前”茶已得到了从来没有过的大丰收。在4月4日、5日清明节那两天，共采制了“明前”茶叶一千一百八十六斤；数量之多，质量之好，历史上的任何年代都不能与之相比。
      “明前”茶一向在清明节前采摘，茶即因此得名。江南的清明时节，天气还不很暖和，茶树嫩芽极少，因而“明前”茶也就稀少。在旧中国时代，真正的“明前”龙井一年采不到几斤。
    据纪录，在清明那天采茶，一斤青茶叶需要七千六百六十四朵嫩芽，四斤半嫩芽才能炒制出一斤“明前”茶来；而一个熟练的采茶女，一天只能采嫩芽十二两左右。由此可见“明前”茶的珍贵。
    今年“明前”茶能够得到这样大量的丰收，与去年冬季开始的全国大跃进有直接的关系。龙井茶区在去冬今春进行了规模空前的防寒、培育工作，下肥数量之多，超过往年数倍。另外在劳动力方面今年一开摘就得到了邻县的大力援助。龙井区除了自有的三千劳动力全部投入采茶炒制生产外，还有萧山、杭县每天六千人支援采茶。有了这些充裕的劳动力，才真正做到了摘嫩、摘快、摘多、摘好的要求，不让一叶嫩芽在树上老掉。
