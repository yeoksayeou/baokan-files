Inspire the working people to cast off their inferiority complex
Invigorate the fearless spirit of creation!
Socialism Liberates the Boundless Creative Potential of the Working People
Mass Inventors Emerge in the Technological Revolution

(Dispatch from our newspaper) In the socialist construction of the motherland, especially amidst the great leap forward of the past six months, mass inventors have emerged everywhere, and inventions and creations have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. This brand-new fact demonstrates that the boundless creative potential of the working people has a vast arena for full development in the wonderful socialist society. The large number of new agricultural tools and implements displayed at the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition showcase the wisdom and talent of the broad masses of inventors.

Among these inventors, the majority are peasants, and there are also workers, handicraftsmen, and rural cadres. People like Zhou Yue’an from Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, who created the rice transplanting boat; Zhang Guangyi from Dengfeng County, Henan Province, who created the furrowing machine and fourteen other agricultural tools and implements; Cao Wentao from Anhua County, Hunan Province, who created the eight-purpose processing machine; Wang Yushun and Wang Shuiwang from Changge County, Henan Province, who created the double-layered deep plowing plow; Huang Jizhi from Fushun County, Sichuan Province, who created the wooden oxen for plowing; He Ting from Tanghe County, Henan Province, who created the hand-cranked automatic soil dumping machine; Ma Ruoguo from Guanghe County, Gansu Province, who created simple measuring instruments; Hu Guifang, a female member of the Shanggao County carpentry cooperative in Jiangxi Province, who created the foot-operated waterwheel; Wang Yuzhen from Yanshi County, Henan Province, who invented the underground tile pipe irrigation ditch; Gu Yizhong from Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, who created the all-purpose mini-cart, are mostly peasants, with a few being rural handicraft workers. The new tools and agricultural implements they invented and created have played a significant role in water conservancy construction, farmland cultivation, and rural transportation, accelerating water conservancy construction, improving cultivation quality, increasing agricultural production, solving the difficulty of labor shortages, reducing the hardship of labor, and greatly promoting the Great Leap Forward.

Reporters interviewed many of them. They are not intellectuals and have not attended any universities or technical schools. They were only recently literacy targets. It was only the literacy campaign that enabled them to read now. Not many people like Zhang Guangyi had a few years of primary school education. He Ting and Wang Yuzhen said it well: so-called "roughnecks" like them, who could not hold their heads up in the old society, never thought of any inventions or creations. Now they are socialist peasants, with the leadership of the Party. The Party leads them in the Great Leap Forward, and they are encouraged. He Ting said that the Party leads him forward, toward a happy life, inspiring him to find ways and means, and stimulating his intelligence.

They are all mass inventors. None of their inventions came from individual imagination; instead, they were created in consultation and experimentation with the masses based on the needs of the masses. Bian Weixiang from Anhui Province, who created the foot-operated, hand-cranked aerial soil transport device, created it together with carpenter Li Yichuan and others at the request of the soil-carrying masses. They create during the labor process, and the fields and construction sites are their laboratories, making them very practical.

These inventors are all young, at most around forty years old. They have abundant creative energy and pay great attention to learning. The inventors who came to participate in this exhibition are all working hard to learn from the advanced experiences of others. Many people meticulously drew diagrams of the new agricultural tools and implements, preparing to take them back for research and promotion. (Photo attached)

The Dongsizhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Yanshi County, Henan Province, created the "Underground Tile Pipe Irrigation Ditch" during the Great Leap Forward. This utilizes the principle of water flowing from high to low, allowing water to flow into underground tile pipes and out of the ground through distribution ponds and reversing ponds for gravity irrigation. This type of channel has the advantages of saving land, labor, and water, facilitating transportation, cultivation, and planting, and preventing flooding.

### 社会主义解放了劳动人民无尽的创造潜力  技术革命中群众发明家辈出

    鼓舞劳动人民打掉自卑感
    振奋大无畏的创造精神！
    社会主义解放了劳动人民无尽的创造潜力
    技术革命中群众发明家辈出
    本报讯　在祖国社会主义建设中，特别在半年来的大跃进声中，群众发明家到处涌现，发明创造如雨后春笋。这个崭新的事实，表明劳动人民无穷无尽的创造潜力，在美好的社会主义社会中有着充分发挥的广阔天地。这次全国农具展览会展出的大批新农具和新工具，就显示了广大群众发明家的聪明才智。
    这些发明家中，大多数是农民，也有工人、手工业工人和农村干部。像创造插秧船的广东省新会县的周岳安，创造打畦机等十四种农具和工具的河南省登封县的张广义，创造八用加工机的湖南安化县的曹文韬，创造双层深耕犁的河南省长葛县的王玉顺和王水旺，创造耕田木牛的四川省富顺县的黄吉之，创造手摇自动倒土机的河南省唐河县的贺亭，创造简易测量仪器的甘肃省广河县的马若果，创造脚踏水车的江西省上高县木器社女社员胡桂芳，发明地下瓦管灌溉渠的河南省偃师县王玉振，创造万能小车的江苏省盐城的顾一忠等，大都是农民，个别的是农村手工业工人。他们创造发明的新工具和新农具，在兴修水利、农田耕作和在农村运输中，发挥了极大的作用，加速了水利建设，提高了耕作质量，提高了农业生产，解决了劳力不足的困难，减轻了劳动的辛苦，大大地促进了大跃进。
    记者访问了他们中的许多人。他们并不是知识分子，没有读过什么大学或技术学校。他们不久以前还是扫盲对象。仅仅因为扫盲运动才使他们现在识字了。像张广义那样读过几年小学的人是不多的。贺亭和王玉振说得好，像他们这些在旧社会里挺不起腰的所谓“老粗”根本没有想到什么发明创造。现在他们是社会主义农民，有党的领导，党领导他们大跃进，他们受到鼓舞。贺亭说，党领导他向前奔，向幸福的生活奔，激发自己要想办法，激发了他的聪明。
    他们都是群众发明家，每一件东西都不是个人凭空想出的，而是在群众要求下，同群众一起商量、试验中创造的。安徽省创造脚踏手摇空中运土器的卞维祥，就是在挑土群众要求下，他和木工李义传等人一起创造的。他们在劳动过程中创造，田间和工地就是实验室，因而非常适用。
    这些发明家都很年青，最多四十岁左右。他们创造精力充沛，非常注意学习。这次前来参加展览会的发明家们，都在努力学习旁人的先进经验。许多人精细地描绘下新农具和新工具的图样，准备带回去研究推广。（附图片）
    河南省偃师县东寺庄农业社在大跃进中创造了“地下瓦管灌溉渠”。这是利用水由高向低流的道理，让水流入地下瓦管，经过分水池、翻水池等流出地面进行自流灌溉。这种渠道具有省地、省工、省水，便利交通、耕作和种植，并能防止大水漫灌等优点。图为这个社的党支书王玉振在全国农具展览会上向观众介绍这种渠道。　　新华社记者　孟庆彪摄
