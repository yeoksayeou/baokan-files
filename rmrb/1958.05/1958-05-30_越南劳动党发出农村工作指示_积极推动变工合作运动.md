Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 29th - The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party recently issued a directive requiring Party committees at all levels to further promote the movement of labor exchange and cooperation in the work of harvesting early rice and sowing late rice this year.

According to personnel from the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party, after Party committees at all levels have studied the directive of the Central Committee of the Labor Party, the movement of labor exchange and cooperation in the Vietnamese countryside will be further developed. It is estimated that by the end of this year, 60% of peasant households will join labor exchange groups; in the movement to develop labor exchange groups, efforts will be made to develop year-round groups with work points recorded.

The Central Committee of the Labor Party pointed out in the above-mentioned directive that the purpose of promoting the movement of labor exchange and cooperation is: to continuously develop the labor exchange movement; to give play to the role of labor exchange groups in promoting production and ensuring the overfulfillment of crop yield targets; and at the same time, to further consolidate and develop agricultural production cooperatives. The directive instructs Party committees at all levels to formulate plans for developing this movement.

Party committees of provinces and counties have recently studied and discussed the Central Committee's directive, and the study and discussion of rural branch committees is underway.

Prior to issuing this directive, the Central Committee of the Labor Party had repeatedly instructed Party committees at all levels to regard the development of the movement of labor exchange and cooperation as the primary task in the countryside. Ho Chi Minh, Le Duan, Truong Chinh and other leaders of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Labor Party have recently visited the countryside many times to provide specific guidance for the mutual aid and cooperation movement in various places. There are currently more than 110,000 labor exchange groups in northern Vietnam, and the number of peasant households participating in labor exchange groups in various provinces has reached 30% to 50% of all peasant households.

At the same time, Vietnam currently has one hundred and seven semi-socialist lower-level agricultural production cooperatives and three higher-level cooperatives. It is expected that by the end of this year, the number of lower-level agricultural production cooperatives will also double the current number.

    越南劳动党发出农村工作指示
    积极推动变工合作运动
    新华社河内29日电　越南劳动党中央最近发出指示，要求各地党委在今年收割早稻和播种晚稻工作中进一步推动变工生产运动。
    据越南劳动党中央农村工作部人士说，在各地党委学习了劳动党中央的指示以后，越南农村中的变工合作运动将进一步发展。预计今年年底60％的农户将加入变工组；在发展变工组的运动中，将大力发展按工记分的常年组。
    劳动党中央在上述指示中指出，推动变工生产运动的目的是：使变工运动不间断地发展；发挥变工组推动生产的作用，保证超额完成农作物的产量指标；同时，进一步巩固和发展农业生产合作社。指示责成各地党委制订发展这项运动的计划。
    劳动党各省、县委最近已经学习和讨论了中央的这项指示，乡支部的学习和讨论正在进行。
    在发出这项指示以前，劳动党中央曾经多次指示各级党委必须把发展变工合作运动作为当前农村中的首要任务。胡志明主席和黎笋、长征等越南劳动党中央的领导人最近曾经多次到农村中巡视，具体指导各地的互助合作运动。越南北方目前约有变工组十一万多个，各省参加变工组的农户已经达到全体农户的30％到50％。
    同时，越南现有一百零七个半社会主义性质的低级农业生产合作社和三个高级社。预计到今年年底，低级农业生产合作社的数目也将比目前增加一倍。
