    Pocket Wireless Telephone
    Weighs Only Half a Kilogram and Can Fit in a Pocket
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st: Soviet engineer Kuriyanovich used a wireless telephone, weighing only half a kilogram and capable of fitting in a pocket, to receive signals from the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite.
    This telephone was made by Kuriyanovich himself. This type of telephone is easy to carry and does not require the installation of wires. On the streets of Moscow, it is possible to talk to Leningrad, Kiev, Prague, and Warsaw. During the Youth Festival last year, a reporter from Berlin Radio contacted the radio station's editorial department through it.

    袖珍无线电话
    重量仅一斤能放口袋中
    据新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联工程师库里扬诺维奇用一架重量只有半公斤的、可以装在衣袋里的无线电话机，收听到苏联第三个人造卫星的讯号。
    这部电话机是库里扬诺维奇自己制造的。这种电话机携带方便，不需要安装电线。在莫斯科的大街上，就可以同列宁格勒、基辅、布拉格、华沙通话。去年联欢节期间，一位柏林广播电台的记者曾通过它和电台的编辑部取得联系。
