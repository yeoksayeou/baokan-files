　　Herdsmen Support Farmers
　　Inner Mongolian Sheep Manure Transported to the Mainland
　　Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 19th - Tens of thousands of Mongolian herdsmen living along the Ji(ning)-Er(lian) railway in the central grasslands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have transported over ten million catties of sheep manure since this spring to support the great leap forward in agricultural production in Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong and other places.
　　Currently, the amount of manure being continuously transported to various regions via the Jining-Erlian railway averages more than 400,000 catties per day. At stations along the railway line such as Baiyinchahan, Zhajiehada, Tumuerte, Saihongtala and Erlian, the manure piles up like mountains, waiting to be transported. Camel caravans, ox carts, and trucks carrying manure from the hinterland of the grasslands continue to stream towards the Jining-Erlian railway.
　　Sheep manure is a good quality fertilizer, most suitable for application on paddy fields or irrigated land. The autonomous region currently has more than 18 million sheep, which can accumulate more than 3 billion catties of sheep manure annually.

    牧民支援农民
　　内蒙古羊粪运到内地
    新华社呼和浩特19日电　居住在内蒙古自治区中部草原集（宁）二（连）铁路沿线的成千上万蒙古族牧民，今春以来已经运出一千多万斤羊粪支援河北、山西、山东等地农业生产大跃进。
    目前，通过集二铁路陆续运往各地的粪肥，平均每天都有四十多万斤。沿着铁路线的白音查汉、渣借哈达、土木尔台、赛洪塔拉和二连等车站上，待运的粪肥，堆积如山。从草原腹地拉着粪肥的骆驼队、牛车和汽车，仍然络绎不绝地奔向集二铁路。
    羊粪肥料质量好，最适合在水田或水浇地上施用。自治区现有一千八百多万只羊，全年可积羊粪三十多亿斤。
