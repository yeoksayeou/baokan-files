    Coal Production May Catch Up with Britain Next Year

    (Our dispatch) Our country's coal production may catch up with Britain next year, which is the conclusion drawn from the coal production situation in the first four months of this year.

    In 1957, the coal production of the central and local authorities was 130 million tons, and in 1958, efforts were made to reach 180 million tons. As of April, the mines under the Ministry of Coal Industry (excluding local mines) had produced 39,020,000 tons of coal, an increase of 10,770,000 tons over the same period last year. The average daily output is also increasing day by day and rising month by month. The average daily output was 311,000 tons in January, 314,000 tons in February, 346,000 tons in March, and 372,000 tons in April. At present, the average daily output of central and local enterprises has reached 500,000 tons. According to this figure, the annual increase can be 50 million tons. By 1959, the national coal production will reach 230 million tons, and it is likely to greatly exceed this.

    Britain's coal production in 1956 was more than 225 million tons, and the actual output in 1957 was 227.2 million tons. By 1965, it is planned to increase to 240 million tons. The total increase in nine years is 15 million tons, calculated at an average annual increase of more than 1.6 million tons, and it can only reach 230.4 million tons in 1959. It can be seen that it is entirely possible for our country's coal production to catch up with and surpass Britain in the shortest possible time.

    1958 is a turning point for the further development of China's coal industry. In the rectification campaign, conservative thinking was cleared up, the shackles of dogmatism were broken, and especially after relying on local enterprises and the masses, many new atmospheres have emerged in the coal industry system. Among the more than 2,000 counties in the country, more than 1,500 counties have coal resources. The enthusiasm of local governments at all levels to develop the coal industry is very high. In 1957, the coal production of local enterprises was 36 million tons, and it is expected to increase to 160 million tons by 1962. There are 45 counties with coal in Hunan Province, which has 86 counties. In 1957, 2.98 million tons were produced, 6 million tons will be produced this year, and 8.4 million tons are planned to be produced in 1962. More than 80 counties in Jiangxi have coal, with 300,000 tons produced in 1957, and it will increase to 1.2 million tons this year.

    Some old coal mines in state-owned coal mines, such as the Fushun Laohutai Mine, Longfeng Mine, and Kailuan Coal Mine, were thought to be unable to increase production. However, after opposing dogmatism, the situation has changed greatly. The original equipment capacity of the Fushun Laohutai Mine was only 2.4 million tons. Some people said that the conveyor belt can only transport 10,000 tons of coal a day, and the output cannot be increased even if it is transported. Recently, after improvement, the conveying capacity of the belt has been increased to 17,700 tons.

    There is great potential in accelerating well construction. During the first five-year plan period, it took an average of 26 months to build a mine with an annual output of 300,000 tons, but now it only takes about one year. For medium-sized mines, it used to take an average of 36 months to build, but now it only takes 21 to 26 months. It used to take an average of 44 months to build large mines, but now it only takes 32 to 38 months. The speed of construction is accelerated, and the production capacity increases rapidly. These favorable conditions also show that it is no problem for China's coal industry output to catch up with Britain in a short period of time. (Attached picture)

### 煤炭产量明年可能赶上英国

    煤炭产量明年可能赶上英国
    本报讯　我国煤炭产量明年就可能赶上英国，这是从今年前四个月的煤炭生产情况得出的结论。
    1957年中央和地方的煤炭产量是一亿三千万吨，1958年争取达到一亿八千万吨。到4月份为止，煤炭工业部所属各矿（不包括地方）已经生产煤炭三千九百零二万吨，比去年同期多一千零七十七万吨，平均日产量也是日日增多，月月上升。一月份平均日产量三十一万一千吨，二月份三十一万四千吨，三月份三十四万六千吨，四月份已达到三十七万二千吨。目前中央和地方企业平均日产量已达五十万吨。根据这个数字推算，每年可以增长五千万吨，到1959年，全国煤炭产量将达到二亿三千万吨，而且还有可能大大超过。
    英国1956年煤炭产量是二亿二千五百多万吨，1957年实际产量是二亿二千七百二十万吨，到1965年计划增加到二亿四千万吨。九年共增长一千五百万吨，以平均每年增长一百六十多万吨计算，1959年只能达到二亿三千零四十万吨。由此可见，我国煤炭产量完全有可能在最短时间内赶上和超过英国。
    1958年是我国煤炭工业进一步发展的转折点。在整风中清算了保守思想，打破教条主义的束缚，尤其是依靠地方企业、依靠群众以后，煤炭工业系统出现了很多新气象。全国二千多个县中，有一千五百多个县煤炭有资源。各级地方政府发展煤矿工业的积极性非常高。1957年，地方企业煤炭产量是三千六百万吨，预计到1962年可以增加到一亿六千万吨。湖南全省八十六个县，有四十五个县有煤，1957年生产二百九十八万吨，今年将生产六百万吨，1962年计划生产八百四十万吨。江西八十多个县有煤，1957年生产三十万吨，今年将增长到一百二十万吨。
    国营煤矿中有些旧井，如抚顺老虎台矿、龙凤矿，开滦煤矿等，有人认为不能增产了。但是反掉了教条主义以后，情况大大改变。抚顺老虎台矿原设备能力只有二百四十万吨。有人说运输皮带一天只能运一万吨煤，产量再提高也运不出来。最近经过改进，皮带的运输能力提高到一万七千七百吨。
    加快建井速度方面有着很大潜力。第一个五年计划期间，建设一个年产三十万吨的矿井，平均要二十六个月，现在大约只要一年就可以建成。中型矿井，过去平均要三十六个月建成，现在只要二十一到二十六个月就可建成。大型矿井过去平均四十四个月建成，现在只要三十二到三十八个月就可建成。建设速度加快，生产能力就增加得快。这些有利条件，也说明我国煤炭工业产量在短期间内赶上英国是不成问题的。（附图片）
