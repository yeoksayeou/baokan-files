    Pay Attention to Exploiting Wild Medicinal Materials
    Currently, many barren hills are being reclaimed, and many Chinese medicinal materials are found there. For example, in Songjiashan, Ebian, Sichuan, where I am, preliminary discoveries include medicinal materials such as Chinese angelica, Chinese goldthread, rhubarb, achyranthes, lily, gastrodia elata, and acanthopanax. Because most of the people reclaiming the land do not recognize medicinal materials, they throw them away along with grass roots and branches, or pile them up to burn into ash for fertilizer, which is a great pity. In order to fully meet the supply of Chinese medicinal materials and increase some sideline income for farmers, I suggest that attention should be paid to exploiting wild medicinal materials during land reclamation.　Huang Hua

    注意挖掘野生药材
    目前，有许多荒山在开垦，其中有许多中药材。例如我们这里——四川峨边宋家山，仅初步发现的就有当归、黄连、大黄、牛膝、百合、明麻、五加皮等药材。由于垦荒的人绝大部分都不认识药材，把它们连同草根树枝一齐扔掉，或堆在一起烧灰积肥，这实在太可惜了。为了充分满足中药材的供应，为农民增加一些副业收入，我建议开荒时应该注意挖掘野生药材。　黄华
