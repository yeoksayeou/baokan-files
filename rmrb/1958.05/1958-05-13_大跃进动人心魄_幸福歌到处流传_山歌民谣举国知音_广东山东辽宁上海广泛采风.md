Xinhua News Agency Report:

　　The Great Leap Forward is Inspiring, Songs of Happiness Spread Everywhere: Folk Songs and Ballads Resonate Nationwide; Guangdong, Shandong, Liaoning, and Shanghai Conduct Extensive Fieldwork

　　This newspaper reports that recently, many rich and vivid folk songs and ballads have been published in Guangdong Province's "Southern Daily" and various county newspapers.
　　On April 25th, the "Southern Daily" published seventeen songs from various parts of the province in a new special column called "Selected Folk Songs." The various inspiring achievements of the Great Leap Forward in rural production have become the subjects of praise and admiration by the working masses. In the Chao-Shan area, a nationally famous high-yield rice area, there is a folk song called "Singing of the Cart Movement" which enthusiastically describes the joy of the local people in carrying out the cart movement. The author wrote the following in the first two sections of this folk song: "Singing songs of happiness from the mouth, the more happiness, the more songs, after singing about agricultural collectivization, we sing about technological innovation. A single carrying pole, two ends tilting, two manure baskets swaying at the tail, shoulders carrying soil to build new roads, building roads for carts instead of shoulders." A folk song "Lord Master's Palace" published in the Rao Ping County newspaper on the 19th, used only four sentences to describe the profound changes that have taken place in this Lord Master's Palace (temple): "Last year, walking into the Lord Master's Palace, the Lord Master sat still with staring eyes; this year, passing the Lord Master's Palace, no Lord Master is seen, but the sound of reading is heard."

　　In order to rapidly carry out the work of collecting folk songs throughout the province, the Propaganda Department of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice in mid-April, requiring the propaganda departments of local Party committees to immediately carry out this work. Before the end of April, the first batch of folk songs, mainly reflecting the current Great Leap Forward in production, should be collected, and special collections should be published by the Propaganda Departments of the county Party committees, special pages should be published by the county newspapers, and singing and exhibitions should be organized by radio stations and cultural centers.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Shandong has done a lot of work in the past month to promote musical creation and extensively collect folk songs.

　　At the Great Leap Forward symposium of the Shandong Province and Jinan City music circles held in late March, the Shandong Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles passed a letter of challenge to the music circles of the province, proposing to complete 1,500 pieces of music in various forms in a hundred-day battle. In less than a month, the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles has received more than 700 songs and more than 150 song lyrics, and has selected excellent works from them to compile "Great Leap Forward Songs," "Selected Creative Songs," and "Songs of Red May." The Shandong Provincial Mass Art Museum has also recently collected 800 folk songs and has compiled and printed 300 of them into a book.

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, since last winter, countless rural folk songs have emerged in various parts of Liaoning during the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. These folk songs reflect the farmers' talents, wisdom, and revolutionary heroism.

　　A folk song from Fuxin County called "We Are the Rain-Making Dragons" says:

　　"Ancient legends say dragons make rain, we are the rain-making dragons,
　　Everyone exerts a heaven-storming effort, able to pluck the moon and take the stars.
　　The Communist Party is the guiding light, the dragon emerges from the sea with soaring momentum,
　　Building dams in mountain gullies to build reservoirs, ordering the rain to obey!"

　　The Propaganda Department of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice to the propaganda departments of various cities and counties in mid-April to "collect folk songs, mountain songs, and ditties reflecting the Great Leap Forward." In just ten days, thousands of songs were sent from various places. The Andong area selected and sent more than 600 songs. At present, in addition to the Liaoning People's Publishing House is publishing rural allegro poems and "The First Collection of Liaoning Folk Songs and Ballads," the other four collections of songs are scheduled to be published successively before "July 1st".

　　According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai is widely collecting folk songs. The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has issued a notice to Party organizations at all levels, requiring them to treat the collection of folk songs as a political task, and to complete the initial collection and sorting before May 15. The Propaganda Department of the Municipal Party Committee will study, select, compile, and publish the songs together with relevant parties.
　　In recent days, many factories, agricultural cooperatives, and neighborhoods have dispatched personnel to record newly composed folk songs during the Great Leap Forward. Some have also visited veteran workers to ask them to recall folk songs popular during the "May 30th" Movement and the three armed uprisings. The Shanghai Cultural Publishing House has published a collection of folk songs entitled "Songs of the Great Leap Forward."

　　大跃进动人心魄　幸福歌到处流传
    山歌民谣举国知音
　　广东山东辽宁上海广泛采风
    本报讯　最近在广东省“南方日报”和各县县报上，发表了许多内容丰富生动的山歌民谣。
    4月25日“南方日报”在新辟的“民歌选”专栏里，全版刊载了省内各地的十七首歌谣。农村生产大跃进中各种动人心魄的成就，成为劳动群众歌颂赞美的题材。全国著名的水稻高产区——潮汕地区，有一首“歌唱车子化”的民歌，就热情洋溢地描写了当地群众开展车子化的喜悦心情，作者在这首民歌的前二段中这样写道：“出口爱唱幸福歌，幸福越多歌越多，唱过农业合作化，又唱技术革新歌。一支扁担两头翘，两只粪箕担尾摇，肩头挑土筑新路，筑路行车代肩挑。”发表在19日饶平县县报上的一首民歌“老爷宫”，只用四句话就描写了这个老爷宫（神庙）发生的深刻变化：“去年走入老爷宫，老爷坐定目瞪瞪，今年走过老爷宫，不见老爷闻书声。”
    为了迅速在全省开展收集民歌工作，中共广东省委宣传部已在4月中旬发出通知，要求各地党委宣传部门立即进行这项工作，在4月底以前，要完成以反映当前生产大跃进为主要内容的第一批民歌收集，并由各县委宣传部主持出版专集，县报出版专页，广播站和文化馆组织演唱和展览。
    据新华社讯　山东各地最近一个月来对繁荣音乐创作和广泛搜集民歌作了许多工作。
    山东省文联在3月下旬召开的山东省暨济南市音乐界大跃进座谈会上曾通过一份给全省各市音乐界的挑战书，提出奋战百日，完成一千五百件各种形式的音乐作品。在不到一个月的时间内，省文联就已经收到七百多首歌曲，一百五十多首歌词；并选择其中的优秀作品编出了“大跃进歌曲集”、“创造歌选”、“红五月的歌”各一册。山东省群众艺术馆最近也搜集到八百首民歌，并已把其中三百首编印成册。
    据新华社讯　去冬以来，辽宁各地在农业生产大跃进中曾经涌现出成千累万的农村歌谣。这些歌谣反映了农民的才能、智慧和革命的英雄气概。
    阜新县一首“咱们就是行雨龙”的歌谣这样说：
    古来传说龙行雨，　咱们就是行雨龙，
    人人使出冲天劲，　能摘月亮取星星。
    共产党是引路灯，　蛟龙出海气势腾，
    山沟拦坝修水库，　喝命雨水把令听！
    中共辽宁省委宣传部在4月中旬曾向各市县的宣传部门发出“搜集反映大跃进的民歌、山歌和小调”的通知，仅在十天内，各地送来的歌谣就有几千首，安东地区经过精选送来的歌谣就有六百多首。目前，辽宁人民出版社除正在出版农村快板诗和“辽宁民歌民谣第一集”外，其他四本歌谣集准备在“七一”前陆续出版。
    据新华社讯　上海市正在广泛收集民歌。中共上海市委宣传部已经给各级党组织发出通知，要求把收集民歌当作政治任务来进行，并且在5月15日前初步收集、整理完毕，由市委宣传部会同有关方面研究、选择编印出版。
    这几天，许多工厂、农业社和里弄已经派出专人记录大跃进中新编的民歌，有的还访问老工人，请他们回忆“五卅”和三次武装起义时期流行的民歌。上海文化出版社已出版一册民歌集“大跃进之歌”。
