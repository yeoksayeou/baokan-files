　　“Learn the Language of the People”
    A few months ago, I received a letter from Xi'an asking me to write an article on "the accuracy, clarity, and vividness of newspapers" for the 11th anniversary of the founding of the *Masses' Daily*. I was too busy traveling to write it. But I have some opinions; now I record them below.
    Eleven years ago, the Border Region *Masses' Daily* was published in Yan'an to make it understandable to the masses with low levels of education; it seemed to imply that the level of speech and writing of intellectuals was higher than that of the masses. However, in reality, intellectuals cannot write what the masses want to read. For example, accuracy, clarity, and vividness are everywhere in the thoughts and words of the masses, but intellectuals do not often have them; the masses can say it, but not necessarily write it; intellectuals cannot say it, and therefore cannot write it. Accurate, clear, and vivid words and sentences must come from the masses, that is to say, we must learn from the masses. After being refined by the writer, they should be returned to the masses to see if they are accepted by the masses and whether they can improve the language of the masses.
    After the rectification campaign, many unexpected production enthusiasm and achievements have emerged among the workers and peasants, and also many good articles have emerged, which can serve as examples for writing.
    Big-character posters are a tool for promoting democracy and improving work, and also a tool for improving literature. Their characters are large, not allowing you to write too long: wearing a head, dragging a tail, and installing some accessories in the middle; they write about specific things, not allowing you to "talk nonsense and say nothing." They are written by everyone and can be written by everyone. They are no longer the domain monopolized by those who are used to wielding pens. Good articles from the masses are emerging here.
    On May 6th, the *China Youth Daily* published a big-character poster written by Comrade Zou Jilu's grandfather, who had only read more than half of the "Hundred Family Surnames" and had a limp:
    "I asked the factory to let me guard the gate of the living area. I don't want wages because I have a son and grandson to support me. Don't look at my limp, my body is lame but my heart is not; my ears are not deaf, and my eyes are also good, and I can write a few words."
    What a touching thing, and what a beautiful article!
    There are many better articles than this in big-character posters, as long as you are willing to look for them.
    In the great leap forward in production, and in the rural socialist debates, many good articles and good poems have emerged, most of which were created by the masses, and the names of the authors cannot be found. They are practical, concise, and everyone can understand, sing, and remember them. For example, the Famine Relief Song of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu, Henan:
    Early autumn lost, late autumn salvaged.
    Agriculture lost, sideline occupations found.
    Everyone starts cutting green grass.
    Every family stores pig feed.
    No bankruptcy, no loans,
    Guarantee self-sufficiency and no three calls.
    From the summary of Yingju Cooperative's victory over the disaster, their late autumn income last year totaled 25,300 yuan, exceeding the original plan of 13,000 yuan by nearly double; they cut and stored 50,000 jin of green grass for feed, transforming from a grass-deficient cooperative to a grass-surplus cooperative; the collected and stored pig feed can last until the end of April this year. Because they had too many loans in the past and had to pay interest and principal every year, they felt that being in debt was not a good thing, so they decided not to take out loans. They did this and sang it like this. It is accurate and vivid, and can strengthen and improve everyone's beliefs and enthusiasm.
    The report on the Hong'an experimental field summarized the experience of weeding peanuts, with a few catchy rhymes:
    "The first weeding is shallow (i.e., hoeing shallowly), the second weeding is deep (i.e., hoeing deeply), the third and fourth weedings are like embroidery (i.e., hoeing carefully)."
    Like these refined words, one sentence can be worth a thousand. People with low levels of education like it, and people with high levels of education also like it.
    In Dujiangyan in Chengdu, I saw a three-character scripture on water management passed down from who knows when: "Dig the bottom deep, build the weir low; six-character formula, eternal mirror. Dig river sand, pile embankment; build 'fish mouth', install 'sheep pen'; establish 'surge gate', leave 'leakage tank'; weave cage tightly, install stones sturdily; divide 'four six', balance floods and droughts; water draws symbols, iron stakes appear; diligent annual repairs, prevent disasters." It can be seen that in ancient times, there were people who used easy-to-remember language to leave the experience of the masses for future generations to see and sing. It is still very useful even now. This three-character scripture has some local terms that working people understand as soon as they hear them, but so-called intellectuals have often overlooked them.
    I am not saying that all articles should be written like clapper talk or catchy rhymes, but rather that we should break the conventions of writing, seek accuracy in meaning, and write about the object of writing appropriately; seek vivid words and sentences that are easy to understand and remember. People do not like to read prose that is not vivid and clear, and people do not necessarily like to read verse that is not vivid and clear.
    I am also not saying that articles are always better when they are short, but rather that they should not be empty. If it takes a longer article to explain something clearly, then it should be longer. What we should pay attention to is that although the writer has eaten their fill and can write as long as they want, they should also consider the energy of the reader.
    Finally, I quote a few words from Chairman Mao:
    "We must learn the language of the people. The vocabulary of the people is very rich, lively, and expresses real life. Many of us have not learned the language well, so when we write articles and give speeches, we do not have many lively, practical, and powerful words, only a few rigid tendons, like a beggar, thin and ugly, not like a healthy person."
    Now should be the time for us to be healthy, and we should strive to learn the language of the people to nourish the weakness of our own bodies.

### “学人民的语言”

专栏：

　　“学人民的语言”
    几个月前，西安来信，要我为纪念群众报创刊十一周年纪念，写点关于“报纸的准确性鲜明性生动性的文章。”我因走路忙，没有写。但有点意见；现在记在后面。
    十一年前边区群众报在延安出版，是为使文化水平低的群众能看得懂；似乎是说知识分子说话作文的程度，比群众高。但是，实际上群众要看的东西，知识分子并不能写得出。比如准确性、鲜明性、生动性，群众的思想上言词上到处有，知识分子却不常有；群众能念得出，不一定写得出；知识分子念不出因而也就写不出。准确、鲜明、生动的词句，要从群众中来，即是说要向群众学。经过执笔者的洗炼，再到群众中去，看是否为群众所接受，是否能使群众的语言有所提高。
    整风以后，在工人农民群众中跃出好多出人意料的生产干劲和生产成绩，同时也跃出不少的好文章，可以做写文章的榜样。
    大字报是发扬民主改进工作的工具，也是改进文学的工具。它字大，不容许你写得太长：戴一个头，拖一条尾，中间还要安装些佩带；它写的是具体事，不容许你“空话连篇，言之无物。”它是谁都要写也谁都能写的，它再不是惯弄笔杆子的人霸占的园地，群众中的好文章就在此露头了。
    5月6日中国青年报载邹积禄同志的只读过多半本“百家姓”、瘸了腿的爷爷写的大字报：
    “我要求厂里，叫我在生活区门房看门。我不要工钱，因为有儿子和孙子养活我。别看我瘸，人瘸心不瘸；我耳朵不聋，眼也挺好使，也能写几个字”。
    多么动人的事，也是多么美的文章！
    大字报里比这更好文章多着，只要你肯留心去找。
    在生产大跃进中，农村社会主义大辩论中，出现很多好文章好诗，绝大部分是群众创造的，找不出作者姓名。它切合实际，字数简短，人人能懂、能唱、能记。比如河南封丘应举农业社的渡荒歌：
    早秋丢，晚秋捞。
    农业丢，副业找。
    人人动手割青草。
    家家储备猪饲料。
    不破产，不贷款，
    保证自给三不叫。
    从应举社战胜灾荒的总结上看，他们去年晚秋收入总折款二万五千三百元，超过原计划一万三千元将近一倍；割储饲料青草五万斤，变缺草社为余草社；集储猪饲草可以供吃到今年4月底。他们因以前贷款太多，每年要付息偿本，感到欠债不是好事，因而决定不贷款。这样做就这样唱。既准确，又鲜明，可以坚定与提高大家的信念和干劲。
    红安试验田的报告上，总结花生锄草的经验，有几句顺口溜：
    “头草割（即锄得浅），二草挖（即锄得深），三、四道草如绣花（即锄得细）”。
    像这样经过洗炼的话，一句话可以抵千百句。文化低的人喜欢、文化高的人也喜欢。
    在成都的都江堰，看到不知何时传下的治水三字经：“深淘滩，低作堰；六字诀，千秋鉴。挖河沙，堆堤岸；砌“鱼嘴”，安“羊圈”；立“湃缺”，留“漏罐”；笼编密，石装健；分“四六”，平潦旱；水划符，铁桩现；勤岁修，预防患”。可见很古的时候，就有用通俗易记的语言，把群众的经验，留给后人看，也留给后人唱的。一直传到现在还很有用。这篇三字经有些土名词，劳动人民一听就懂，而历来所谓知识分子却常常忽视这些。
    我不是说所有文章都要写成像快板、顺口溜的一类的东西，而是说应该打破文章的常规，求得意思准确，恰如其分地写出所写的对象；求得词句鲜明，容易看懂也容易记住。不生动鲜明的散文，人民不喜欢念，不生动鲜明的韵文，人民也不一定喜欢念。
    我也不是说，文章总以短为好，而是说不要空。要长一些才能说得清楚的只好长一些。我们要注意的，是写的人虽然吃饱了饭，要写多长就多长，但也要顾及看的人的精力。
    最后，引毛主席的几句话：
    “要向人民群众学习语言。人民的语汇是很丰富的，生动活泼的，表现实际生活的。我们很多人没有学好语言，所以我们在写文章做演说时没有几句生动活泼切实有力的话，只有死板板的几条筋，像瘪三一样，瘦得难看，不像一个健康的人”。
    现在应该是我们健康的时候了，努力学习人民的语言，以哺养自己身体的虚弱。
