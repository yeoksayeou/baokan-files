Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, 16th: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" published an editorial on the 15th entitled "Comprehensively Deviating from Marxism-Leninism."

　　The editorial said that the emergence of the world socialist system, headed by the Soviet Union, is the most significant historical event since the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution. This is the victory of the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism. The balance of power between socialism and imperialism in the world has undergone fundamental and world-historically significant changes in the last forty years. Imperialism is no longer the sole master of the world. In addition to imperialism, there is also the world socialist system, whose strength has surpassed that of imperialism and the reactionaries. Now, without the participation of the Soviet Union, without the participation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, it is impossible and unimaginable to solve any problems related to the fate of human history.

　　It is precisely this that drives international imperialism mad, making it desperately want to eliminate socialism, to regain its lost position, and to restore its rule over the world. Under this insane rage and hatred, the reactionary bourgeoisie has exhausted all kinds of different means and methods.

　　Historical facts show that in the struggle against Marxism-Leninism, against the international communist and workers' movement, and against socialist countries, capitalist reactionaries have always used revisionism as their most reliable weapon. And that is what it is doing now.

　　The editorial said that modern revisionist and anti-Marxist viewpoints are most vividly and systematically reflected in the program adopted at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which was held not long ago, especially in its adopted program.

　　If we want to briefly explain the essence of this program, then it should be said that this program is the code of modern revisionism. As everyone knows, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party did not send a delegation to the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Originally, our Party Central Committee, at the invitation of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, had decided to send such a delegation, and had even promptly decided on the composition of the delegation and notified the Yugoslav leadership of this. However, when our Party Central Committee received the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, after this draft was carefully studied, the Central Committee had to change its original decision.

　　On April 11th of this year, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party listened to the report by Comrade Zhivkov, First Secretary of the Central Committee, on the Political Bureau's evaluation of the essence of the draft program of the LCY, and the plenary session unanimously accepted this evaluation and decided not to send a delegation of the Bulgarian Communist Party to the Congress of the LCY. The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party promptly notified the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia of its decision in a special letter and at the same time raised its criticisms of the draft program. However, the Yugoslav leaders did not regard the friendly criticism of the draft program as assistance from fraternal communist parties (including our Party). On the contrary, during and after the congress, they increasingly deviated from Marxism-Leninism. Our Party has always believed that the LCY program completely violates the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and contains extremely absurd and harmful evaluations and conclusions regarding our international communist and workers' movement, the entire international situation, and the situation in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. These conclusions and evaluations not only crudely violate the declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries adopted in Moscow last November, but also crudely violate the Peace Manifesto adopted by the representatives of sixty-four Communist and Workers' Parties, including the representative of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Every political party has the right to creatively apply the principles of Marxist-Leninist theory in accordance with the specific characteristics of each country, to formulate its own program and charter, and to determine its strategy and tactics. However, when a party that considers itself a communist party takes an anti-Marxist stance, draws incorrect conclusions about the international communist movement, and takes actions that divide this movement, when it revises the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism and carries out a movement against the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet Union, then it cannot and should not turn a blind eye and stand idly by.

　　The editorial pointed out that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a comprehensive revision of Marxism-Leninism. The program's assessment of the role and significance of the great October Socialist Revolution, the significance of the world communist movement, and the role and position of the Soviet Union in international relations, has nothing in common with Marxist-Leninist theory or with the actual situation. Due to the nationalist stance taken by the Yugoslav leaders, they underestimated the world-historical significance of the October Revolution for the victory of socialist revolutions in other countries (including Yugoslavia). They deliberately ignored the historical fact that without the victory of the Soviet army over fascism, the struggle of the Yugoslav people would not have succeeded. They are arrogant and disdain the world-historically significant experience of socialist construction in the Soviet Union. Without creatively applying this experience, it is impossible to successfully build socialism in one's own country.

　　The program distorts the development of international relations. It consciously replaces the profound contradiction between socialism and capitalism in the domestic and international spheres with the "theory" of contradictions between two military-political blocs. It is not difficult to understand who this "theory" serves. It serves imperialism, because it conceals the class nature of contradictions in modern society, because it conceals the difference between the capitalist system and the socialist system, and because it equates these two systems. The program deliberately fails to mention the aggressive nature of imperialism, especially American imperialism. It is strange, but true, that in the report of Tito, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, he even defended the imperialist policies of the American ruling group!

　　The aggressive, reactionary, and predatory aims and ambitions of American imperialism are now well known throughout the world. The masses of people in those countries that are politically and economically dependent on the United States particularly deeply feel these things. No one's efforts, even those made on the podium of a "Communist Party" congress, can conceal and defend the aggressiveness and exploitative nature of American imperialism.

　　In the aforementioned LCY program, there are not only incorrect and harmful arguments, but also arguments that are hostile to and slander the Soviet Union. It mixes the goals and practices of Soviet foreign policy with those of the United States and other imperialist countries. Completely disregarding historical facts, it accuses the Soviet Union of a strange crime, blaming the Soviet Union for vying for hegemony and attempting to exploit the people of other countries.

　　In fact, Soviet foreign policy shows that the Soviet Union has always been steadfastly and sincerely committed to easing international tensions, reducing armaments, and resolving all issues through negotiations and mutual understanding. Both in the past and now, Soviet foreign policy has always been aimed at protecting the freedom and independence of all peoples, at freeing all peoples from imperialist oppression, and at enabling them to develop on an autonomous path. They do not mention these things, but equate the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with that of the United States and other imperialist countries, that is, they deliberately mislead the masses, obstruct the unity of world socialist forces and democratic forces, in order to directly serve imperialism and undermine the cause of socialism.

　　The editorial pointed out that the program describes the development of the international communist and workers' movement as a spontaneous process without the leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties. The program does not mention a single word about the great upsurge of the current international communist and workers' movement, about uniting its ranks and strengthening its unity, or about the necessity of establishing a leading center for the international communist and workers' movement. The program also does not mention a single word about the leading role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the international communist and workers' movement, or the leading role of the Soviet Union in the socialist camp. On the contrary, it greatly exaggerates, slanders the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and arrogantly criticizes the international communist movement.

　　In order to belittle the international significance of the Soviet Union's experience in socialist construction, the program distorts the true development of the Soviet system, ignoring the historically significant victories and achievements of the Soviet system. At the same time, the program does not forget to boast that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia have made contributions to consolidating the cause of socialism worldwide. To understand this "contribution," one only needs to recall the position taken by the Yugoslav leaders during the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Hungary in 1956. At that time, the Yugoslav leaders stood on the side of the traitor Nagy Imre, sparing no effort to undermine the unity of the international communist movement and the unity of the world socialist camp, and slandering the Soviet Union, thereby aiding the imperialist's unwarranted attacks against socialism and peace.

　　One cannot ignore the fact that the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, who deny the world-historical significance of the experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet people, have repeatedly displayed their own experience with an arrogance that is unbecoming of communists and imposed it on others, repeatedly demonstrating that they can play the role of the center of the world communist movement.

　　The editorial said that our Party and other Marxist-Leninist parties have repeatedly emphasized that the central position and role of the international communist and workers' movement is not arbitrarily obtained by any party, but belongs to the party that has this necessary nature due to historical development. It is generally acknowledged that the great Communist Party of the Soviet Union is such a party today. It was the first in the world to complete the socialist revolution, the first to build a socialist society, and has the richest experience in revolutionary struggle and socialist construction.

　　The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is a program of revisionist views that have been concocted since the era of the Second International. These views include the idea that capitalism can "peacefully grow into" socialism through the path of state capitalism. The LCY program promotes this untenable argument: capitalism can collapse automatically, the supra-class nature of bourgeois states, and other anti-Marxist "theories" that have long been refuted by Marxism-Leninism and historical practice.

　　Marx, Engels, and Lenin have theoretically demonstrated the issue of the role of the state.

　　The forty years of experience of the Soviet Union and the experience of other socialist countries have confirmed the great significance of the socialist state, which is an extremely important factor in socialist construction. The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia makes erroneous and harmful estimates of the nature and role of the socialist state and the Communist Party under the conditions of the transition period from capitalism to socialism. The leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia regard the creation of conditions to make the socialist state wither away and to abolish the leading role of the party from the very beginning of the transition period as the basic and decisive, most important task. For them, the following facts are of no significance: that the socialist economy and culture have not yet been established; that there are still remnants of the overthrown exploiting classes at home; that international imperialism is constantly attempting to interfere in the internal affairs of socialist countries and preparing to launch a war against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp. The anti-Marxist theory put forward by the Yugoslav leaders regarding the withering away of the socialist state during the transition period will lead to nothing but disarming the socialist state in the face of heavily armed international imperialism. Naturally, it is impossible to list here all the extremely erroneous and harmful arguments presented in the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Not only is the program discussed at the Ljubljana Congress full of anti-Marxist, revisionist statements, but also anti-Soviet and anti-communist attacks and slanders. At the Seventh Congress of the LCY, in the reports of Tito, Kardelj, and Ranković, and in the speeches of many representatives, the firepower was concentrated on opposing the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, opposing other socialist countries and opposing the Communist and Workers' Parties of various countries. In essence, the Congress became a malicious demonstration against the Soviet Union and the socialist camp, against the Communist Party of the Soviet and the international communist and workers' movement. In this regard, it is enough to cite a few facts.

　　Tito, General Secretary of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, said that the Soviet Union's policy was the reason for the establishment of the aggressive North Atlantic Group. He said, "Due to Stalin's tough and unnecessarily threatening (?) foreign policy, the Western powers saw that they could not achieve their goals through diplomatic means, so they adopted such a position: believing that they could only achieve these goals through 'strength position'. This is the main reason for the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty...".

　　Obviously, if the Soviet Union's foreign policy was not so "tough," and allowed American imperialists to achieve their predatory goals through diplomatic channels... Tito would be satisfied, Tito described Yugoslavia's relationship with the United States as completely based on "mutual respect, equal cooperation, and non-interference in internal affairs, while believing that the Soviet Union has a tendency to achieve hegemony."

　　Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, and others have all accused the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, but none of them have said a word to accuse world imperialism, especially American imperialists. Today, even children know that these imperialists are the most vicious enemies of socialism and peace, they are doing everything possible to aggravate international tensions and are openly preparing to launch a war of aggression against the socialist camp, and even have more vicious conspiracies. Tito expressed the hope on the Congress podium that the policies and positions adopted by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia "will be aligned with the policies and positions of the United States and other Western countries as often as possible." Tito and others thanked the United States for its "aid" with subservience, but they mentioned "economic cooperation" with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with great care and reluctance.

　　The editorial pointed out that attacking and slandering the policies of the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union, while hoping to take a common stance with the imperialist countries headed by the United States, this is the policy of the Yugoslav line mentioned in Tito's report and approved by the Congress. Tito said, "All hopes that the positions we have taken on international and domestic issues will make concessions will only waste time and be detrimental to all of us." This oath proves the view that the LCY leaders consciously formulated this program and maintained the positions elucidated in the program, thereby causing harm to the world communist and workers' movement and to socialism. Only in this way can it be explained why the imperialist propaganda agencies have praised the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and why these propaganda agencies are most happy to promote the LCY program. Only in this way can it be explained why influential members of Congress in Washington and New York have been clamoring for a rapid increase in "aid" to Yugoslavia. The imperialist bourgeoisie has never praised true Marxists, nor has it ever given them economic and financial assistance, but has always waged a struggle to politically and physically eliminate them, but now they gladly open the doors of their banks, is this fact not worthy of special consideration? The Bulgarian Communist Party cannot compromise on the erroneous theoretical concepts of the leading organs of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia aimed at opposing Marxism-Leninism and the international communist movement. The Bulgarian Communist Party declares its firm opposition to this nationalist split line, because this line is to undermine the unity of the world communist movement and the unity of socialist countries. It is known that this line is manifested in attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of certain neighboring countries and neighboring parties. The purpose of doing this is to undermine the unity of the party and the unity of the people in these countries, to create centrifugal forces of unhealthy elements, and to hinder socialist construction. It is known that the leading organs of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia attempted to create an anti-leadership of our Party and national leadership during and after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in April; attempted to create hostile sentiments among the leaders of certain communist parties in socialist countries; and tried to cause divisions and chaos in the ranks of the world democratic trade union movement and the youth movement.

　　The editorial pointed out that the Communist and Workers’ Parties cannot remain silent on the reports and speeches of the Yugoslav leaders, who adopted a more serious revisionist attitude at the congress, and openly carried out a dishonest smear campaign against the Soviet Union and against socialism.

　　The official newspapers of many fraternal parties—"Pravda," "People's Daily," "Rote Fahne," "Rudu Pravo" and "Neues Deutschland," etc., published critical articles. These articles deeply studied the work of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and once again analyzed the anti-Marxist positions of the LCY program adopted at the congress, and criticized the anti-Soviet and anti-communist remarks of Tito, Kardelj, Ranković, and others. In carrying out the criticism, the fraternal party organs were standing on the position of Marxism-Leninism, concerned about the unity of socialist countries, and proceeding from the interests of the Yugoslav people.

　　"Pravda" wrote: "It cannot be overlooked that if ideological differences are not eliminated, but continue to deepen, then naturally they will also cause differences on political issues. If the relationship between socialist countries is strengthened and improved, but the relationship between the parties that lead these countries, which have a common Marxist-Leninist ideological system, deteriorates, it is strange."

　　"People's Daily" emphasized: "The leaders of the LCY should think calmly, can the LCY maintain unity with the Communist Parties of various countries if it abandons the basic views of Marxism-Leninism and adheres to revisionist views? Is there a basis for unity without the common views of Marxism-Leninism? Is it beneficial to the Yugoslav people to refuse to be friendly with the socialist camp countries and to refuse to be friendly with the Communist Parties of various countries?"

　　The editorial pointed out that all of this should have enlightened the Yugoslav leaders that they are taking a dangerous path—Yugoslavia and the League of Communists of Yugoslavia have cut themselves off from their true and loyal friends—the world socialist countries, Communist Parties and Workers' Parties. However, Belgrade is unwilling to recognize this dangerous path. The Yugoslav leaders are unwilling to recognize the harm they have caused to the international workers' movement, and do not consider the interests of the Yugoslav people. This once again proves that the Cominform's criticism of the leaders of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia for deviating from Marxism-Leninism and falling into bourgeois nationalism in 1948 still has its full significance today.

　　The editorial finally pointed out that the Bulgarian Communist Party, which was cultivated by Dimitar Blagoev and Georgi Dimitrov, has grown into a party that is unswervingly loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and will never reconcile with any opportunism and revisionism. Throughout its history, our Party has been waging an uncompromising struggle against phenomena that deviate from Marxist-Leninist principles in Bulgaria and internationally. The Bulgarian Communist Party is a creator of the Communist International, and it has always actively participated in the work of the Communist International, fighting together with other fraternal parties, under the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, against the manifestations of right-wing opportunism, defending the purity of Marxism-Leninism, and striving to strengthen the unity of Communist and Workers' Parties around the world. Recently, when international imperialism attempted to launch a large-scale offensive, the Bulgarian Communist Party also demonstrated its loyalty to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. Its active participation in the Moscow Conference and its signing of the two declarations adopted at the conference is a re-expression of this loyalty. Loyal to this revolutionary tradition, the Bulgarian Communist Party is now also resolutely waging an irreconcilable struggle against the main danger of the international communist and workers' movement—modern revisionism. At its upcoming Seventh Congress, the Bulgarian Communist party will once again show its unity, show its unwavering loyalty to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and the world communist movement led by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, to formulate the task of further victorious development of our country's socialism.

### 保加利亚“工人事业报”社论指出  南共纲领全面背离马克思列宁主义

　　保加利亚“工人事业报”社论指出
　　南共纲领全面背离马克思列宁主义
    新华社索非亚16日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”15日以“全面背离马克思列宁主义”为题，发表了社论。
    社论说，以苏联为首的世界社会主义体系的出现，是伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利以后最重大的一个历史事件。这是不朽的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。全世界社会主义和帝国主义之间的力量对比，在最近四十年内发生了根本的、具有全世界历史意义的变化。帝国主义现在不再是世界上唯一的主人了。除了帝国主义之外，还存在着世界社会主义体系，它的力量已经超过了帝国主义和反动派的力量。现在，没有苏联的参加，没有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的参加，要解决任何有关人类历史命运的问题，都是不可能的，都是不可想像的。
    正是这一点使得国际帝国主义发狂，使得它拚命想要消灭社会主义，想要挽回它已丧失了的地位，恢复自己对世界的统治。在这种疯狂的暴怒和仇恨之下，反动资产阶级使尽了各种不同的手段和方法。
    历史事实表明，在反对马克思列宁主义、反对国际共产主义运动和工人运动、反对社会主义国家的斗争中，资本主义反动派总是利用修正主义作为自己的最可靠的武器。而它现在也是这样干的。
    社论说，现代修正主义观点和反马克思主义观点，在不久前举行的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会上，特别是在它所通过的纲领中，反映得最为鲜明、最为系统。
    如果要概括地说明一下这个纲领的实质，那么应当说，这个纲领是现代修正主义的法典。大家知道，保加利亚共产党中央委员会没有派代表团参加南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会。本来我们党的中央委员会应南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会的邀请曾经决定派出这样的代表团，并且还及时地决定了代表团的组成和把这一点通知了南斯拉夫的领导。但是，当我们党的中央委员会收到南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案以后，当这个草案被仔细地研究以后，中央委员会不得不改变它原来的决定。
    今年4月11日保加利亚共产党中央委员会听取了中央委员会第一书记日夫科夫同志关于政治局对南共纲领草案实质的评价的报告，全会一致接受这个评价，并且决定不派保加利亚共产党代表团参加南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表大会。保加利亚共产党中央委员会及时地把它的决定用专门的信通知南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会并且同时提出了它对纲领草案的批评意见。然而，南斯拉夫的领导人并没有把对纲领草案的友好的批评看作是兄弟共产党（其中包括我们党）的帮助。相反，他们在代表大会期间和大会以后变本加厉地背离了马克思列宁主义。我们党从前和现在都认为南共纲领完全违背马克思列宁主义的基本原理，其中包含着对于我们国际共产主义运动和工人运动、对于整个国际形势、对于苏联和其他社会主义国家局势的十分荒谬而有害的评价和结论。这些结论和评价不仅粗暴地违背了去年11月在莫斯科所通过的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的宣言，而且也粗暴地违背了包括南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表在内的六十四个共产党和工人党的代表所通过的和平宣言。每个政党有权根据各国的具体特点创造性地运用马克思列宁主义理论的原则，自己制订纲领和章程，决定战略和策略。但是，当一个认为自己是共产党的政党站上了反马克思主义的立场、对国际共产主义运动做了不正确的结论、采取了分裂这个运动的行动的时候，当它在修正马克思列宁主义的基本原理和开展反对苏联共产党和苏联的运动的时候，那就不能够也不应该置若罔闻和袖手旁观。
    社论指出南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领是对马克思列宁主义的全面修正。纲领中对伟大的十月社会主义革命的作用和意义、对世界共产主义运动的意义以及对苏联在国际关系中的作用和地位的估价，是同马克思列宁主义理论、同实际情况没有任何共同之处的。由于南斯拉夫领导人采取了民族主义的立场，因而对于十月革命对其他国家（其中包括南斯拉夫）的社会主义革命的胜利的世界历史意义的作用估计不足。他们有意忽视这样一个历史事实：如果没有苏军对法西斯的胜利，南斯拉夫人民的斗争就不会成功。他们妄自尊大，渺视苏联社会主义建设的具有世界历史意义的经验。如果不能创造性地运用这种经验就不能在本国内成功地建设社会主义。
      这个纲领对国际关系的发展作了歪曲。它有意识地以关于两个军事政治集团之间的矛盾的“理论”来代替国内和国际范围的社会主义和资本主义之间的深刻矛盾。不难理解这种“理论”是为谁服务的，它是为帝国主义服务的，因为它掩盖了现代社会中矛盾的阶级性，因为它掩饰了资本主义制度和社会主义制度之间的区别，因为它把这两种制度等同起来了。纲领中蓄意不提帝国主义、首先是美帝国主义的侵略本质。在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会总书记铁托的报告中，竟为美国统治集团的帝国主义政策辩护，这是奇怪的事，但却是事实！
    美帝国主义的侵略的、反动的和掠夺的目的和野心现在在全世界是众所周知的。在政治上和经济上依赖美国的那些国家的人民群众特别深刻地体会到这些东西。无论是谁的努力，即使是在“共产党”代表大会讲坛上所作的努力都不能掩盖和辩护美帝国主义的侵略性和剥削性。
    在上述南共纲领中，不仅包含着不正确和有害的论点，而且包含着敌视和污蔑苏联的论点。把苏联的外交政策的宗旨和作法同美国和其他帝国主义国家的政策的宗旨和手段混为一谈。完全不顾历史事实，给苏联加了一个奇怪的罪名，责备苏联争夺霸权和企图剥削其他国家人民。
    事实上，苏联的外交政策说明，苏联一向是坚持不懈地衷心致力于缓和国际紧张局势、裁减军备、通过谈判和互相了解的方式解决一切问题。无论过去和现在，苏联的外交政策一向是旨在保护各国人民的自由和独立，旨在使各国人民摆脱帝国主义的压迫和使他们在自主的道路上发展。他们不提这些，却把苏联和其他社会主义国家的外交政策同美国和其他帝国主义国家的外交政策等同起来，也就是他们故意地使人民群众迷失方向，阻挠世界社会主义力量和民主力量的团结，以便直接为帝国主义效劳和破坏社会主义事业。
    社论指出，纲领中把国际共产主义运动和工人运动的发展说成是一个没有马克思列宁主义政党领导的自发过程。关于目前国际共产主义运动和工人运动的巨大高涨、关于团结它的队伍和加强它的统一、关于建立国际共产主义运动和工人运动领导中心的必要性，纲领中只字未提。纲领也只字未提苏联共产党对国际共产主义运动和工人运动的领导作用，以及苏联对于社会主义阵营的领导作用。相反地，它大事渲染，污蔑苏联和苏联共产党，妄自尊大地批评国际共产主义运动。
    为了贬低苏联在社会主义建设方面的经验的国际意义，纲领曲解苏维埃制度的真实发展情况，无视苏维埃制度的具有历史意义的胜利和成就。与此同时，纲领并没有忘记吹嘘，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫联邦人民共和国对巩固全世界社会主义事业作出了贡献。要了解这种“贡献”，只需要回忆一下1956年匈牙利反革命叛乱期间南斯拉夫领导人所采取的立场就够了。那时，南斯拉夫领导人站在叛徒纳吉·伊姆雷那边，不惜一切力量破坏国际共产主义运动的团结和世界社会主义阵营的团结，中伤苏联，从而给帝国主义的反对社会主义和和平的无端进攻效了劳。
    不能无视这样一个事实，否认苏联共产党和苏联人民的经验的世界历史意义的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人，以共产党人所不应有的高傲态度一再显示自己的经验并且硬加于他人，一再显示他们可以起世界共产主义运动中心的作用。
    社论说，我们党和其他马克思列宁主义政党不止一次地强调指出，国际共产主义运动和工人运动的中心地位和作用并不是哪个党任意取得的，它属于由于历史发展而具有这种必要的性质的党。大家公认，伟大的苏联共产党今天是这样的党。它在世界上第一个完成社会主义革命，第一个建成社会主义社会，具有革命斗争和社会主义建设的最丰富的经验。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领彻头彻尾地是从第二国际时代起就泡制好了的修正主义观点的纲领，这些观点就是：认为资本主义通过国家资本主义的道路就可以“和平长入”社会主义，南共纲领宣扬这种站不住脚的论点：资本主义可以自动崩溃、资产阶级国家的超阶级性、以及其他早被马克思列宁主义和历史实践所驳倒了的反马克思主义的“理论”。
    马克思、恩格斯和列宁已经从理论上论证了国家作用的问题。
    苏联四十年的经验和其他社会主义国家的经验证实了社会主义的国家的重大意义，它是社会主义建设中一个极重要的因素。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领对从资本主义到社会主义过渡时期条件下社会主义的国家和共产党的性质和作用作了错误的、有害的估计。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人把在过渡时期就开始创立条件来使社会主义的国家消亡、使党的领导作用取消这件事当作基本的和具有决定性的、最重大的任务。对他们来说，下列事实是没有什么意义的：社会主义经济和文化还没有建立起来；国内还有被推翻了的剥削阶级残余的存在；国际帝国主义不断地企图干涉社会主义国家的内政，准备对苏联和社会主义阵营发动战争。南斯拉夫领导人所提出的关于社会主义国家在过渡时期就消亡的这种反马克思主义的理论不会导致别的，而只会使社会主义国家在武装到牙齿的国际帝国主义面前解除武装。自然这里不能一一列举南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领中大量提出的一切极其错误的、有害的论点。不仅在卢布尔雅那代表大会上经过讨论的纲领充满了反马克思主义的、修正主义的提法，反苏反共的攻击和污蔑。在南共第七次代表大会上，在铁托、卡德尔和兰科维奇的报告中和许多代表的发言中，火力集中于反对苏联和苏联共产党，反对其他社会主义国家，反对各国共产党和工人党。实质上，代表大会沦为反对苏联和社会主义阵营、反对苏联共产党和国际共产主义运动和工人运动的恶意示威。在这方面，只要举出一些事实就够了。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟总书记铁托说，苏联的政策是促使侵略性的北大西洋集团建立的原因。他说，“由于斯大林的强硬的、毫无必要的威胁性的（？）外交政策，西方列强看到它们不能通过外交途径来达到自己的目的，于是就采取这样的立场：认为它们只有靠‘实力地位’才能达到这些目的。这就是建立北大西洋公约的主要原因……”。
    显然，如果苏联的外交政策不是那么“强硬”，而让美帝国主义者通过外交途径来实现掠夺性的目的……铁托是会感到满意的，铁托把南斯拉夫同美国的关系说成完全是建立在“互相尊重、平等合作和不干涉内政的基础上，而认为苏联则有取得霸权的倾向”。
    铁托、卡德尔、兰科维奇和其他人纷纷责难苏联和其他社会主义国家，但是，他们没有一个人开口说过一句话责难世界帝国主义，特别是美国帝国主义者。今天就连孩子都知道，这些帝国主义分子是社会主义和和平的最凶恶的敌人，他们千方百计地在加剧国际紧张局势并且明目张胆地准备向社会主义阵营发动侵略战争，甚至还有比这更为恶毒的阴谋。铁托在大会讲坛上表示希望，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的政策和立场“尽可能更经常地同美国和其他西方国家的政策和立场取得一致”。铁托和其他人卑躬屈节地对美国经济的“援助”称谢，但是，却非常小心翼翼和勉为其难地提到同苏联和其他社会主义国家进行的“经济合作”。
    社论指出，对以苏联为首的社会主义国家的政策进行抨击和污蔑，而希望同以美国为首的帝国主义国家采取共同的立场，这就是铁托在报告中谈到的并且得到代表大会批准的南斯拉夫路线的方针。铁托说，“一切希望我们在国际问题上和国内问题上所采取的立场会作出让步的等待，都只会浪费时间和对我们大家不利”。这个誓言证明了这样一种看法：南共领导者有意识地拟定了这个纲领和维护纲领中所阐明的立场，从而给世界共产主义运动和工人运动带来损害，给社会主义带来损害。只有这样才能解释，为什么帝国主义的宣传机构对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导赞不绝口，为什么这些宣传机构最乐于为南共纲领宣扬。只有这样才能解释，为什么在华盛顿和纽约的有影响的议员们已经在吵嚷不休，主张从速增加对南斯拉夫的“援助”。帝国主义资产阶级从不曾赞扬过真正的马克思主义者，也不曾给过他们经济上和财政上的帮助，而是一向进行了在政治和肉体上消减他们的斗争，可是现在却欣然敞开自己银行的大门，难道这个事实不值得特别深思吗？保加利亚共产党对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导机关的旨在反对马克思列宁主义和国际共产主义运动的错误的理论概念是不能妥协的。保加利亚共产党声明坚决反对这种民族主义的分裂路线，因为这种路线是要破坏世界共产主义运动的团结和社会主义国家的团结。大家知道，这种路线表现在企图干涉某些邻国和邻国党的内政上。这样做的目的是要破坏这些国家中党的团结和人民的团结，造成不健康因素的离心力量，妨碍社会主义建设。大家知道，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的领导机关在保加利亚共产党中央委员会4月全会期间以及4月全会以后试图造成一种反对我国党的领导和国家的领导的情绪；企图在社会主义国家的某些共产党的领导之间造成敌对情绪；力图在世界民主工会运动和青年运动的队伍中引起分裂和混乱。
    社论指出南斯拉夫领导人在代表大会上的报告和发言中采取了更厉害的修正主义的态度，同时公开进行反对苏联、反对社会主义的不正直的诽谤运动，因此共产党和工人党不能对此保持沉默，这是很自然的。
    许多兄弟党的机关报——“真理报”、“人民日报”、“红色权利报”、“人民之声报”和“新德意志报”等等刊出了批评文章。这些文章深入地研究了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的工作，再一次分析了代表大会上通过的南共纲领的反马克思主义立场，批评了铁托、卡德尔和兰科维奇等人的反苏、反共的言论。兄弟党机关报在进行批评时，都是站在马克思列宁主义的立场上，关心社会主义国家的团结以及根据南斯拉夫人民的利益出发的。
    “真理报”写道：“不能不看到，意识形态的分歧假如不是消除、而是继续加深，那么自然也就会引起政治问题上的分歧。假如社会主义国家之间的关系加强了和改善了，但是具有共同的马克思列宁主义思想体系的、领导这些国家的政党之间的关系却恶化了，这是会令人感到奇怪的。”
      “人民日报”着重指出：“南共领导人应该冷静地想一想，难道南共放弃马克思列宁主义的基本观点，而坚持修正主义的观点，能够保持同各国共产党的团结吗？难道没有马克思列宁主义的共同观点，能够有团结的基础吗？难道拒绝同社会主义阵营各国友好，拒绝同各国共产党友好，对南斯拉夫人民是有利的吗？”
    社论指出，这一切本来可以使南斯拉夫领导人得到这样的启示：他们走的是一条危险的路——南斯拉夫和南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟自绝于它们的真正忠实的朋友——世界社会主义国家、共产党和工人党的道路。然而，贝尔格莱德不愿意认清这条危险的道路。南斯拉夫的领导人不愿意正视他们给国际工人运动造成的危害，不考虑南斯拉夫人民的利益。这再一次证明了，共产党情报局1948年对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟领导人脱离马克思列宁主义和陷入资产阶级民族主义的批评在现在仍然有其充分意义。
    社论最后指出，季米特尔·布拉戈耶夫和格奥尔基·季米特洛夫所培育出来的保加利亚共产党已经成长为一个不渝地忠诚于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义、并决不同任何机会主义和修正主义相调和的政党。我们党在全部历史中一直在同保加利亚和国际上的脱离马克思列宁主义原则的现象进行不妥协的斗争。保加利亚共产党是共产国际的一个创造人，他一直积极参加共产国际的工作，同其他兄弟党一起，在苏联共产党领导下进行斗争，反对右倾机会主义的表现，维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁，争取加强全世界共产党和工人党的团结一致。最近，当国际帝国主义试图大举进攻的时候，保加利亚共产党也表现了它忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义。它积极参加了莫斯科会议并且在会上通过的两项宣言上签了字，这就是这种忠诚的再度表现。保加利亚共产党忠实于这种革命传统，现在也坚决地同国际共产主义运动和工人运动的主要危险——现代修正主义作不可调和的斗争。保加利亚共产党在它的即将召开的第七次代表大会上将要再一次地显示出它的团结一致，显示它毫不动摇地忠实于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的原则以及以苏联共产党为首的世界共产主义运动，拟定进一步胜利地发展我国社会主义的任务。
