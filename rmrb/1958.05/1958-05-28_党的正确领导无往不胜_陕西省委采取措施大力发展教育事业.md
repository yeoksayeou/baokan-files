The Party's Correct Leadership is Always Victorious
Shaanxi Provincial Committee Takes Measures to Vigorously Develop Education

(Reported by our correspondent Qi Yuanzhen) The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) has strengthened its leadership over education. In early May, the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee convened a symposium of Party committee secretaries and presidents of universities across the province to discuss strengthening the Party's leadership in universities and overcoming dogmatism in schoolwork. Subsequently, the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee convened a provincial education work conference attended by more than 120 secretaries and propaganda ministers in charge of cultural and educational work from various district and county committees, focusing on issues such as running people-managed agricultural middle schools, popularizing primary school education, vigorously improving the quality of public ordinary primary and secondary schools, and further strengthening the Party's leadership over education.

With the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a mass upsurge in cultural learning has begun in Shaanxi Province. In less than a month, 20 counties across the province have popularized primary school education. Mei County, Shang County, and other places have also established more than 240 people-managed agricultural middle schools and other vocational schools. In three days, Ankang County established nearly a thousand people-managed primary and secondary schools, popularizing primary education.

To adapt to this new situation, the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee, at its two plenary (enlarged) meetings held this year, made the popularization of cultural education and the elimination of illiteracy among the main topics of the meeting. The meetings summarized the experiences of the Northwest Agricultural College and Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in establishing a contact system, the Xi'an No. 1 Aviation Technical School in adhering to work-study programs, and the Xinfeng Cooperative in Pucheng County in running night schools. It was decided to promote these experiences throughout the province. Decisions were also made regarding engineering colleges and secondary vocational schools training technical cadres for local industry, and universities training teachers for middle schools, so that teaching, scientific research, and production are closely integrated.

The Provincial Committee adopted a method of using selected units to promote overall progress, vigorously developing ordinary education. After Zhao Boping, secretary of the CPC Shaanxi Provincial Committee, discovered the experience of the Party organization of the Xinfeng Agricultural Cooperative in Pucheng County in running schools by relying on the masses, he immediately sent people to assist the county committee in summarizing the experience and promoting it throughout the province.

The Provincial Committee also instructed relevant leading departments to convene an on-site meeting to promote the experience of the people-managed middle school classes in Wufang Township, Huayin County, in adhering to the principle of learning while working and strengthening political and ideological education.

At the same time, the Provincial Committee frequently sent people to various universities to help carry out the "double-anti" movement. It convened a meeting of Party committee secretaries of various universities approximately every half month for inspection. It also promptly convened on-site meetings at Jiaotong University, Northwest University, and other four universities to exchange experiences on how to thoroughly break with the old and establish the new, and break while establishing, in teachers' ideological remolding.

The Provincial Committee proposed at a recent meeting that it is necessary to implement a system in which secretaries take the lead, the entire Party is mobilized, the masses are relied upon, and schools are run by all the people, launching a mass movement for running schools throughout the province. It also determined the following measures to strengthen the Party's leadership over education and promote the great development of education: Each level of Party committee should have a secretary or deputy secretary specifically in charge of education. According to actual circumstances, education work should be studied several times within a year. A batch of cadres should be allocated to the education department. Currently, the Provincial Committee has already transferred a batch of experienced Party members to take leadership positions in higher and secondary schools. Before the summer vacation this year, local Party committees should also equip primary and secondary schools in their respective areas with Party member principals. In middle schools with more than twelve classes, a full-time Party branch secretary should be assigned. Grassroots Party organizations should be established and improved, and the Party's ranks in schools should be strengthened. The past method of mainly relying on departmental leadership in education should be changed to mainly relying on local leadership. The existing sixty-plus complete middle schools, senior middle schools, and thirteen secondary normal schools should all be handed over to the direct leadership of the special districts and counties. County governments should be fully responsible for primary school teachers and make overall arrangements. The enrollment work for middle schools and secondary normal schools should also be handled separately by each special district and county.

In order to solve the problem of teachers in the great development of education and improve teaching quality, the Provincial Committee has determined that localities should currently adopt methods such as short-term training, gradual promotion, plain areas supporting mountainous areas, public schools supporting people-managed schools, and extending the internship period for normal school graduates to vigorously cultivate teachers and meet the needs of the great development of education. At the same time, long-term plans should be made, and it should be determined that the existing two normal colleges are responsible for training teachers for public middle schools. From 1961, all teachers and students in public middle schools will be trained and supplied by universities and colleges in the province. Yan'an Public School and Hanzhong Normal College, which are currently under preparation, will train agricultural middle school teachers in the Yan'an and Hanzhong areas. The thirteen secondary normal schools delegated to the prefectures and counties (cities) will be used as the main bases for cultivating teachers for people-managed middle schools in various localities.

In terms of improving teaching quality, the Provincial Committee has determined that localities should rely on all teachers to carry out a planned and cautious teaching reform movement on the basis of the rectification movement. A comprehensive and thorough inspection of teaching ideology, textbook content, teaching methods, and teaching quality should be carried out and improved in a timely manner. Schools should strengthen and improve their political and ideological work for students. In addition to reforming political courses in the teaching reform, attention should also be paid to strengthening ideological education through various teaching methods, and the policy of combining education with productive labor should be correctly implemented. The political and ideological education and ideological remolding of teachers should be strengthened. Methods such as combining theory with practice and systematically studying Marxism-Leninism should be used to fundamentally remold them.

    党的正确领导无往不胜
    陕西省委采取措施大力发展教育事业
    本报讯　记者戚元珍报道：中共陕西省委已经加强了对教育工作的领导。5月初，中共陕西省委召开了全省高等学校党委书记、校院长座谈会，讨论加强高等学校党的领导和学校工作中克服教条主义等问题。接着，中共陕西省委又召集各地委、县委主管文教工作的书记和宣传部长等一百二十多人举行了全省教育工作会议，着重研究举办民办农业中学和普及小学教育、大力提高公办普通中小学质量及进一步加强党对教育工作的领导等问题。
    随着工农业生产大跃进，一个群众性的学习文化的高潮，已经开始在陕西省出现。在不到一个月的时间内，全省就有二十个县普及了小学教育。郿县、商县等地还办起了民办农业中学及其他职业中学等二百四十多处。安康县在三天中就办起了近千所民办中小学，普及了小学教育。
    为了适应这种新形势，中共陕西省委在今年举行过的两次全体（扩大）会议上，就把普及文化教育、扫除文盲等文化教育工作，作为会议主要议题之一，会议总结了西北农学院和烽火农业社建立联系制度、西安第一航空技工学校坚持勤工俭学和蒲城县新丰社办夜中学等经验，决定向全省推广；还做出了关于工科高等学校和中等专业学校为地方工业培养技术干部、高等学校为中学培养师资等决定，使教学、科学研究和生产密切结合起来。
    省委采用以点带面的办法，大力发展普通教育事业。中共陕西省委书记赵伯平发现蒲城县新丰农业社的党组织依靠群众办学的经验后，立即派人协助县委总结经验，在全省推广。
    省委还责成有关领导部门召开了现场会议，推广华阴县五方乡民办中学班坚持边劳动边学习和加强政治思想教育的办学经验。
    同时，省委经常派人深入各高等学校帮助开展双反运动。约在半个月左右，就召集一次各高等学校 党委书记进行检查；还及时在交通大学、西北大学等四个高等学校召开交流教师思想改造中如何大破大立、边破边立等经验的现场会议。
    省委在最近召开的会议中提出，必须实行书记挂帅，全党动员，依靠群众，全民办学，在全省范围掀起一个群众性的办学运动。并确定了下列措施以加强党对教育事业的领导，促进教育事业的大发展。各级党委要有一名书记或副书记专管教育事业，根据实际情况一年内对教育工作研究若干次。给教育部门配备一批干部。目前，省委已经抽调了一批经过锻炼的党员分配到高等和中等学校担任领导工作。各地党委在今年暑期以前也要配齐本地区中小学的党员校长。在十二班以上的中学里，配备一名专职的党支部书记。建立和健全党的基层组织，壮大学校党的队伍。把过去教育事业的条条领导为主的办法，改变为以块块领导为主，把现有的六十多所完全中学、高级中学和十三所中等师范学校全部交给专区和县直接领导。小学教师全部由县负责，统筹安排。中学和中等师范学校的招生工作也实行各专区和县单独招生的办法。
    省委为了解决教育事业大发展中的师资问题，提高教学质量，确定各地当前采用短期训练、逐级提拔、平原支援山区、公办支援民办、延长师范学校毕业生实习时间等办法，大力培养师资，满足教育事业大发展的需要。同时要做长期打算，确定现有的两所师范学院负责培养公办中学的教师。从1961年起，公办中学的师生全部由本省大专学校培养供给；正在筹备的延安公学、汉中师范专科学校，培养延安和汉中地区的农业中学教师。把下放到专署和县（市）的十三所中等师范学校，作为各地主要培养民办中学师资的基地。
    在提高教学质量方面，省委确定各地在整风运动的基础上，依靠全体教师有计划地慎重地开展一次教学改革运动。对教学思想、教材内容、教学方法和教学质量作全面彻底的检查，及时改进；加强和改进学校对学生的政治思想工作，除在教学改革中改革政治课教学，还注意通过各种教学加强思想教育，正确地贯彻勤工俭学的方针。加强教师的政治思想教育和思想改造工作；用理论联系实际、系统学习马列主义等方法从根本上进行改造。
