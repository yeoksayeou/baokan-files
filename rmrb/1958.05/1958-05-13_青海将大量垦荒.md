Qinghai to Reclaim Large Amounts of Wasteland

(Report from our newspaper) In order to rapidly change the backward face of Qinghai Province, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently decided that state-owned farms should reclaim 10 million mu of wasteland during the Second Five-Year Plan period. Work is currently underway.

Qinghai Province has good natural conditions for large-scale reclamation of wasteland and development of agriculture. First, there is a lot of wasteland. Second, the land is concentrated and flat. Third, there is sufficient water. Fourth, there are abundant fertilizer resources.
