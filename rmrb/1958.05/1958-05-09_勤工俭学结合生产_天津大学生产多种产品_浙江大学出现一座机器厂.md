　　Work-Study Programs Combined with Production
　　Tianjin University Produces Various Products
　　A Machine Factory Appears at Zhejiang University

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Tianjin University has achieved initial results in its work-study program. A short time ago, the university completed the processing of more than two hundred train wheels for the Ministry of Railways; it also delivered a portion of the gears manufactured for the Tianjin Crane Factory. The furnace in the foundry workshop has already produced its eighth batch of molten iron, casting twenty-six tons of mechanical castings. Currently, to meet production needs, teachers, students, and technicians are installing a cupola furnace that will produce more than two tons of iron per hour.

　　Students majoring in papermaking in the Papermaking Department have used equipment that was previously thought to be only capable of producing "toilet paper" to produce four thousand kilograms of paper. They also produce colored advertising paper and are now producing smooth and bright snow-flake paper. The ceramics factory of the Silicate Department is now producing ceramic rings for the installation of instruments and equipment. Students from the Civil Engineering and Architecture Departments are designing and constructing the university's eight capital construction projects. The trial production of dial indicators by teachers and some students in the Precision Instrument Department has been successful. Tianjin University has also signed production cooperation contracts with many units outside the university.

　　(Reported by this newspaper) Recently, one hundred and eighty students from Zhejiang University have joined the work-study program. A medium-sized machine manufacturing factory will appear at the university.

　　This factory does not require the state to invest in the purchase of any machinery or equipment, nor does it recruit any employees. It simply merges the Mechanical Engineering Department's practice factory, the metal cutting laboratory, the foundry laboratory, and the repair factory to become a medium-sized machine factory with seven work sections and two hundred and forty machines. This factory has already received orders worth more than one million yuan, including six-foot lathes, eight-foot lathes, and small drill press standard parts, etc.

　　The Electrical Engineering Department has decided to cooperate with the Mechanical Engineering Department to manufacture 7,000 electric motors and many knife switches and fuses for the state this year, using existing equipment.

　　The Chemical Engineering Department has decided to accept the purification of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric acid from the Hangzhou Reagent Factory, producing a total of 1,500 kilograms per month, and also to accept the preparation of anhydrous alcohol from the Hangzhou Reagent Factory. The Civil Engineering Department has decided to accept the civil engineering design of a 9,000-square-meter rubber factory and a 1,500-square-meter workers' cultural palace. The Materials Mechanics Teaching and Research Group will sign a long-term contract with the Zhejiang Iron and Steel Plant to measure the properties of the plant's materials.

    勤工俭学结合生产
    天津大学生产多种产品
    浙江大学出现一座机器厂
　　本报讯　天津大学在勤工俭学活动中，已获得初步成果。不久前，替铁道部加工的火车轮，已完成了二百多个；替天津起重机厂制造的齿轮，也交出了一部分；铸工车间的熔炉，已经吐出了第八炉铁水，铸造了二十六吨机械铸件。目前，为了适应生产需要，教师、学生和技工们正安装一个冲天炉，每小时将出铁两吨以上。
    造纸系造纸专业的同学，利用过去被人认为只能生产“手纸”的设备，已经生产出四千公斤的纸张。他们还生产彩色的广告纸，现在正生产光滑洁白的雪连纸。矽酸盐专业的陶瓷工厂，现正生产供给仪器设备安装的瓷环。土木系和建筑系的同学，正为学校的八项基建工程进行设计和施工。精密仪器专业教师和部分同学试制的千分表，已经成功。天津大学还和校外许多单位订立了生产协作合同。
    本报讯　最近浙江大学有一百八十名学生投入勤工俭学活动。一座中型机器制造厂将在该校出现。
    这座工厂不要国家投资购置任何机器设备，也不招收一个职工，仅仅将这个学校机械系的实习工厂、金属切削实验室、铸工实验室合并，再加上修造工厂，就成为有七个工段，二百四十多台机器的中型机器厂。这个厂已接受订货一百余万元，其中包括六呎车床、八呎车床、小型钻床标准件等等。
    电机系决定和机械系协作，利用现有设备，今年为国家制造电动机七千台，闸刀、熔断器多件。
    化工系决定接受杭州试剂厂关于盐酸、硫酸、硝酸的提纯工作，每月共产一千五百公斤，还接受杭州试剂厂无水酒精的制备工作。土木系决定接受九千平方公尺的橡胶厂、一千五百平方公尺的工人文化宫的土木建筑设计。材料力学教研组要与浙江钢铁厂订立长期合同，给该厂测定材料的性能。
