Amidst the tide of technological innovation, the Hefei Automobile Repair Factory in Anhui Province overhauled a diesel truck in four hours and forty minutes, setting a new national record for the shortest time to overhaul a car.

In the past, it took this factory twenty to thirty days to overhaul a car, and the longest took fifty to sixty days. During the Great Leap Forward, they learned from the experience of the Chengdu Automobile Repair Factory, which overhauled a truck in nine hours and thirty minutes. They broke with conventions and changed the past "specialized division of labor, assembly line car repair method" to a "total assembly contracting, simultaneous progress, cross-cooperation" car repair method. Self-disassembly, self-cleaning, self-repair, self-assembly, with leading cadres going deep into the front lines and material supply personnel delivering materials to the workshops, greatly shortening car repair time and auxiliary production time.

    4点40分大修一辆汽车
    在技术革新的浪潮中，安徽省合肥汽车修理厂以四小时四十分钟的时间，大修好一辆柴油货车，创造全国大修汽车最短时间新纪录。
    过去，这个厂大修一部汽车都要二、三十天，最长的有五、六十天。在大跃进中，他们学习了成都汽车修理九小时三十分钟大修一部货车的经验，打破陈规，把过去的“专业分工、流水作业修车法”，改为“总成包干，齐头并进，交叉协作”的修车法。自拆、自洗、自修、自装，领导干部深入现场，材料供应人员下车间送料，大大缩短了修车时间和辅助生产时间。（附图片）
