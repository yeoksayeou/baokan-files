    Eastern Scales and Western Claws
    Wax Paper Made Without Wax
    The Hangzhou Xinhua Wax Paper Factory has successfully trial-produced wax paper that does not use white wax.
    Iron stylus wax paper is a specialty of Zhejiang Province, with its output accounting for more than 70% of the country's total. It is made by applying wax to thin paper, and the wax used is imported white wax with a high melting point. The "Iron Stylus Protein Wax Paper" now successfully trial-produced by the Xinhua Wax Paper Factory only has a layer of gelatin applied to the thin paper. This type of wax paper is smooth to write on, not easily broken, and can be printed up to 10,000 copies without leaking any ink (ordinary iron stylus wax paper can only print about 1,000 copies). The cost is also 10% lower than ordinary iron stylus wax paper. This type of wax paper is also very convenient for corrections. (Yong Tai)
    Xing'anling Bilberry Wine
    Xing'anling bilberry wine is brewed by the newly built Yakeshi Winery in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, using wild berries of the Ericaceae family called "Dusi" produced in the Greater Khingan Mountains. This wine is purple-red, sweet and delicious. The wine contains vitamins and fructose and other nutrients.
    The Greater Khingan Mountains area is rich in berries such as Dusi and Yageda (also known as red beans). In 1956, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region built a fruit wine brewery in Yakeshi and began aging bilberry wine using Dusi juice in August of that year. (Bai Hao)
    Artificial Cotton Made From Waste
    Twenty counties in the Shijiazhuang Special Zone of Hebei Province, including Wuji and Xinle, have successfully trial-produced artificial cotton from cotton stalk bark, rice straw, various melon vines, willow and other tree bark, hemp stalk bark, malian, daylily, corn cob husks, and rotten chicken feathers, and have already made socks, cloth, etc., with good quality, which can completely replace finished products made of natural cotton.

    Artificial Silk Made From Coniferous Trees
    The first skein of artificial silk in Zhejiang Province was recently successfully trial-produced at the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill. This viscose rayon is made by chemically treating pulp made from coniferous trees, and then spraying it through a machine. Its cost is less than a quarter of that of silk, and mass production is now being prepared.
    Cocoon Waste Made Into Wool
    In early April, the Hangzhou Fuhua Silk Factory trial-produced artificial wool and artificial camel hair from the by-product of cocoon waste. The technicians of this factory found in experiments that the sericin content of cocoon waste reached 43%. After chemical treatment, the sericin was fixed, and artificial wool and camel hair were made. This kind of wool can be woven into high-grade fabrics. This factory produces 380 dan of cocoon waste every year, which can be made into artificial wool materials worth more than 300,000 yuan.

    东鳞西爪
    制腊纸不用腊
    杭州新华腊纸厂试制成功不用白腊的腊纸。
    铁笔腊纸是浙江省的特产，产量占全国70％以上，它是用皮纸拖腊制成的，所用的腊是熔点较高的进口白腊。现在新华腊纸厂试制成功的“铁笔蛋白腊纸”，只在皮纸上拖一层胶质，这种腊纸书写流利，不易刻破，可以印到一万份以上不漏一点墨（一般铁笔腊纸只能印一千份左右）。成本也比普通铁笔腊纸低10％。这种腊纸涂改也很方便。　　（永太）
    兴安岭的越桔酒
    兴安岭越桔酒是内蒙古自治区新建的牙克石酿造厂利用大兴安岭林区出产的越桔科野果——都斯酿造的。这种酒紫红色，甘美可口。酒内含有维生素和果糖等养分。
    大兴安岭林区盛产都斯、牙疙疸（又名红豆）等浆果。1956年内蒙古自治区在牙克石修建了一座果酒酿造厂，当年8月开始利用都斯的果汁陈酿越桔酒。　（白皓）
    废品制的人造棉
    河北省石家庄专区无极、新乐等二十县已将棉秸皮、稻草、各种瓜蔓、杨柳等树皮、冰麻秆皮、马连、黄花、玉米棒子皮及烂鸡毛等全部试制成功人造棉，并已制成袜子、布匹等，质量良好，完全可代替自然棉的成品。　（王振武）
    针叶树制人造丝
    浙江省第一绞人造丝最近在杭州华丰造纸厂试制成功了。这种粘胶人造丝是用针叶树做的浆经过化学处理，再经机器喷制而成的。它的成本还不及蚕丝的四分之一，现正准备大量生产。
    茧衣做毛料
    杭州福华丝绸厂4月初用副产品茧衣试制成人造羊毛和人造骆驼毛。这个厂的技术人员试验中发现茧衣丝胶含量达43％，经过化学处理，使丝胶固着，制成了人造羊毛和骆驼毛。这种毛料可以织成高级织物。这个厂每年产茧衣三百八十担，可以制成价值三十多万元的人造毛料。
