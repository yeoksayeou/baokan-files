    The Slanderer Embarrassed

    Austrian President Schärf said on May 13th: He is one of the few Austrians who has been continuously negotiating with the Soviets since the war. "We have some sharp differences of opinion between us. But we Austrians have found that once the Russians make a promise, they always keep it."

    President Schärf's remarks were clearly aimed at Dulles.

    Everyone knows that Dulles has always used the slander that the Soviet Union does not keep its promises as a favorite means of obstructing summit talks. Earlier this month, he repeated this cliché in a speech at the Atomic Energy Academy in New Hampshire. However, Dulles's slanderous tactics not only failed to work but aroused the disgust of world public opinion. The fact that the President of Austria couldn't bear to listen to Dulles's lies and refuted them with his own experience proves this point.

    诽谤者出丑
    奥地利总统谢尔夫5月13日说：他是战后以来继续不断地同苏联人进行谈判的少数奥地利人之一。“我们之间存在着一些尖锐的意见分歧。但是我们奥地利人发现，一旦俄国人提出诺言，他们总是遵守这种诺言的”。
    谢尔夫总统的这段谈话，显然是针对杜勒斯而发的。
    谁都知道，杜勒斯一直把诬赖苏联不履行诺言作为阻挠最高级会谈的一种得意手段。本月初，他在美国新罕布什尔州原子能学院发表的一篇演说里，还把这种滥调重复了一遍。但是，杜勒斯的这一套诽谤手段不但没有奏效，反而引起了世界舆论的憎恶。奥地利的总统对杜勒斯的谎话感到听不下去而以亲身经历来加以否定，就证明了这一点。
