Leading Cadres Go Deep into Reality and Face the Masses
Sichuan County-Level Organs' Rectification Movement Bears Fruit
(Our newspaper Chengdu dispatch) The Two-Anti Rectification Movement is rapidly changing the face of county-level organs in Sichuan Province. Since March, county-level organs in various parts of Sichuan have adopted methods such as exhibitions, visits, on-site meetings, and competitions to push the Two-Anti Rectification Movement to a climax step by step. Many places have also appropriately arranged time for rectification and production, so that the two tasks can advance side by side. The Santai County-level organs have adopted the method of beating two sets of gongs at the same time for rectification and drought resistance, moving the rectification study to the construction site. During the day, cadres and the masses work together to fight drought, and at night they conduct airing of views and rectification, which has achieved good results.

Leading cadres leaving their offices, going deep into reality, facing the masses, and working with the masses is the most prominent gain of the rectification in county-level organs. At present, the offices of many county-level organs are often deserted, and most of the cadres have gone to the countryside and towns. Some county committees of the Chinese Communist Party or rural work departments have long moved to agricultural cooperatives or water conservancy and drought resistance construction sites to work. Many places such as Nanbu, the county party secretaries and county heads also serve as chairmen of agricultural cooperatives. It has become a trend for leading cadres of county-level organs to go deep into the grassroots, plant experimental fields, and work with the masses. When leading cadres go deep into the grassroots, some long-standing problems are solved. The director of the Shehong County Commercial Bureau led a work team to the countryside to personally help farmers build stoves, solving the problem of coal promotion. The director of the Yanting County Supply and Marketing Cooperative went deep into remote mountainous areas to investigate local products, and as a result, discovered thirty-two kinds of man-made fiber raw materials. On major issues such as spring plowing production and water conservancy and drought resistance, rapid progress has been made after the local leading cadres went deep.

"Everything is for the sake of the masses" has become the starting point for many cadres to consider their work. Many outdated regulations and systems that are not welcomed by the masses, unreasonable practices, and conservative work styles have been swept away in the rectification. In the past, the Anyue County Service Bureau stipulated that farmers had to go through four complicated procedures to kill a pig: village nomination, township review, butcher inspection, and service station contract. Now, it has been simplified to two procedures: pig inspection and contract signing, which is much more convenient for farmers. Many local organs, enterprises, and hospitals have also changed the past system of working on time and off time, which was divorced from the masses. Under the premise of rationally organizing the labor force, they have achieved "full-day office hours, and handle matters as soon as they arrive." The political and legal departments have also abandoned the past practice of sitting in the office and waiting for work, and have gone deep into and approached the masses. The Suining Intermediate People's Court organized three collegiate panels to go to the counties for trial, which achieved good results.

At present, the political atmosphere in county-level organs is unprecedentedly active, and the slogan of learning from the advanced, comparing with the advanced, and catching up with the advanced has been transformed into concrete actions. Many people with backward ideas and work, who seek fame and enjoy life, have raised their awareness in the movement, and some have even become advanced activists.

### 领导干部深入实际面向群众  四川县级机关整风运动开花结果

    领导干部深入实际面向群众
    四川县级机关整风运动开花结果
    本报成都电　双反整风运动正在迅速改变四川省县级机关的面貌，三月以来，四川各地县级机关分别采用了展览、参观、开现场会议、评比竞赛等办法，把双反整风运动一步一步推向高潮，许多地方还适当安排了整风和生产的时间，使两项工作齐头并进。三台县级机关采取了整改、抗旱两套锣鼓一齐打的办法，把整改学习搬到工地进行。白天干部和群众一起抗旱，夜晚进行鸣放整改，收到了很好的效果。
    领导干部走出办公室，深入实际面向群众和群众一道工作，是整风中县级机关最突出的收获。目前，许多县级机关的办公室内常常冷冷清清，干部大部都已下乡、下镇，有的中共县委会或农村工作部早就搬到农业合作社或水利抗旱工地去办公。南部等许多地方的中共县委书记和县长还兼任了农业社社长。县级机关的领导干部深入基层，种试验田，和群众一道工作已形成风气。当领导干部深入基层后，一些长期没有解决的问题解决了。射洪县商业局局长带工作组下乡亲自动手给农民打灶，解决了推广用煤的问题；盐亭县供销社联合社主任深入到边远山区去调查土产，结果发现了三十二种人造纤维原料。在春耕生产、水利抗旱等重大问题上，更是在各地领导干部深入下去后才获得飞速进展的。
    “一切为群众着想”已成为许多干部考虑工作的出发点。许多过时的不为群众欢迎的规章制度、不合理的作法和保守的工作作风都在整风中被一扫而空。安岳县服务局过去规定农民杀一只猪要经过村上提名、乡上审查、屠户看猪、服务站订合同等四项繁琐的手续，现在简化成看猪、订合同两道手续，农民感到方便多了。许多地方的机关、企业、医院也改变了过去脱离群众的按时上下班制度，在合理组织劳动力的情况下，做到“全天办公，随到随办”。政法部门也打掉了过去坐在办公室内等工作的作风，深入、接近群众。遂宁中级人民法院组织三个合议庭下县审判，收到很好效果。
    目前，在县级机关中，政治空气空前活跃，学先进、比先进、赶先进的口号已变为具体的行动。许多思想、工作落后，闹名誉、讲享受的人在运动中提高了觉悟，有的还成为先进积极分子。
