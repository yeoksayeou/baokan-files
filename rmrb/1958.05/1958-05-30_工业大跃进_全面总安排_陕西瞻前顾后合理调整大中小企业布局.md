Industrial Great Leap Forward: Overall Comprehensive Arrangement
Shaanxi Considers All Aspects, Rationally Adjusting the Layout of Large, Medium and Small Enterprises

    (Our correspondent, Wang Jian, reports from Xi'an on May 29) In the spirit of the general line for socialist construction, Shaanxi Province, proceeding from its existing industrial base and development prospects, has promptly made province-wide arrangements and rational layouts for the rapidly developing local industries.
    Shaanxi's local industries are developing very rapidly. Various regions have proposed to build a total of more than 15,000 large and small factories and mines this year, and the province has built and put into operation about 6,000 small factories and mines in the past three months. However, due to the lack of experience in various regions and a lack of understanding of the province's existing industrial base and development direction, the proposed construction projects have shown signs of imbalance in terms of industry proportions and regional distribution. According to the instructions of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Industry has successively held industrial conferences in the province's seven economic cooperation zones. Based on the principle of "centralized leadership, comprehensive planning, division of labor and cooperation," preliminary adjustments were made to the construction projects in various regions to avoid blind development. On this basis, the Shaanxi Provincial Planning Commission, together with relevant leading organs, studied and determined the overall arrangement and rational layout of local industries in the province, combining the existing industrial base and the direction of local industrial development.
    In the process of adjustment, the policy of the whole Party running industry, the whole people running industry, and the simultaneous development of large, medium, and small industries was first implemented. At present, the province's large-scale industries have already achieved a certain degree of development, and more than 50 projects are still under construction. Based on this situation, the distribution of the more than 15,000 medium and small-sized factories and mines to be built this year has been rationally arranged. The state-owned power industry has formed a power supply network in the important areas of Guanzhong, while the power industry in southern and northern Shaanxi is very weak. Therefore, it was decided to move the surplus medium and small-sized power generating equipment in the Guanzhong area to southern and northern Shaanxi. The state-owned coal industry is vigorously developing the Tongchuan mining area, and more than 160 small coal mines will be newly built and expanded this year in areas lacking coal and with inconvenient transportation. In addition to a large factory producing high-grade cement that is currently under construction, six medium-sized cement plants will be newly built in Xi'an, Tongchuan, and Hu County this year to meet the urgent needs of current construction. The low-grade cement needed for water conservancy projects and local industries in various regions will be supplied by more than 70 small local cement plants scattered throughout the region.
    Shaanxi Province has also appropriately adjusted the scale proportions between local light and heavy industries and between various industries based on resources, needs, and technical conditions. At present, the province's metallurgical and other materials industries have no foundation. When adjusting the proportion of light and heavy industries, two-thirds of this year's investment has been used for the construction of raw materials and other heavy industries. It has now been determined to build more than 260,000 tons. In addition to building more than 100 medium-sized and small iron smelting furnaces, a medium-sized steel plant and four small steel plants will also be built, and alloy steel plants, seamless steel pipe plants, steel rolling plants, and coking plants will be built accordingly. In terms of non-ferrous metal smelting, six small copper smelting furnaces with a scale of 1,700 tons each and four small lead and zinc plants with a scale of 1,200 tons each will also be newly built this year. It is planned to produce 85,000 tons of pig iron, 440 tons of copper, and 270 tons of lead and zinc this year, and 30,000 to 50,000 tons of ordinary steel, 15,000 tons of alloy steel, and 7,000 tons of seamless steel pipes next year. Shaanxi Province has also decided to make full use of Xi'an's original mechanical repair industry base to rebuild and build a number of power machinery manufacturing plants, which will be able to produce complete sets of equipment such as water conservancy machinery, generators, tractors, and ordinary lathes this year. In addition, it was also decided to transfer some lathes from Xi'an and establish seven comprehensive medium-sized machinery factories in southern and northern Shaanxi, and strive to establish small repair shops in most counties. In this way, together with the existing automobile repair factories and tractor repair stations in the Guanzhong area, a local machinery manufacturing and repair network centered on Xi'an has been formed. In order to be self-sufficient in liquid fuels in the future, a number of small shale oil and coal oil refining plants will be built in northern Shaanxi and northern Wei this year.
    In the comprehensive arrangement of industrial layout, Shaanxi Province has also taken into account the coordination, balance, and sequential construction order between regions. At the same time, it has also taken into account the cooperation requirements of the five northwestern provinces (autonomous regions), and has given careful consideration to the long-term industrial distribution. At present, it has been roughly determined that along the Xi'an-Baoji railway line, industries such as machinery, electric power, chemical industry, and textile industry will be mainly developed; northern Wei and northern Shaanxi will mainly develop coal and mineral oil and other fuels; and southern Shaanxi will mainly develop various metal smelting industries.

    工业大跃进　全面总安排
    陕西瞻前顾后合理调整大中小企业布局
    本报西安29日电　记者汪坚报道：陕西省根据社会主义建设总路线的精神，从现有工业基础和发展远景着眼，及时地对飞速发展的地方工业进行了全省范围的安排和合理布局。
    陕西地方工业发展速度很快。各地提出今年共要建设一万五千多个大小厂矿，全省在过去三个月内建成并投入生产的小厂矿约有六千多个。但是，由于各地缺乏经验，不了解全省现有工业基础和发展方向，因此提出来的建设项目，在行业比重、地区分布等方面，发生了顾此失彼的现象。陕西省工业厅根据中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会的指示，先后在全省七个经济协作区召开了工业会议，根据“集中领导、全面规划、分工协作”的方针，对各地建设项目做了初步调整，以免盲目发展。陕西省计划委员会同有关领导机关，在这个基础上，结合现有工业基础和地方工业发展方向，研究和确定了全省地方工业统筹安排和合理布局问题。
    在进行调整工作中，首先贯彻执行了全党办工业、全民办工业、大中小型工业同时并举的方针。目前，全省大型工业已有一定的发展，现在正在继续建设的还有五十多个项目。从这个情况出发，合理安排了今年建设的一万五千多个中、小型厂矿的分布。国营电力工业在关中的重要地区的供电网已经形成，而陕南、陕北地区的电力工业则很薄弱。因此，确定将关中地区多余的中小型发电设备迁到陕南、陕北等地。国营煤炭工业正在铜川矿区大力建设，今年就要在缺煤和交通不便的地方新建和扩建一百六十多个小煤井。水泥工业除了正在建设的一座生产高标号水泥的大厂外，今年将在西安、铜川、鄠县等地新建六个中型水泥厂，以满足当前建设的迫切需要。各地兴修水利和地方工业所需的低标号水泥，就依靠分散建立在各地的七十多个小型土水泥厂来供应。
    陕西省还根据资源、需要和技术等条件，适当调整了地方轻、重工业之间，各行业之间的规模比重。目前，全省的冶金等材料工业没有基础，在调整轻重工业比重时，已把今年三分之二投资用于原材料等重工业建设上。现已确定建设的达二十六万多吨，除要建设一百多个中型炼铁炉和小炼铁炉外，还增加建设一个中型炼钢厂和四个小钢厂，并相应地建设合金钢厂、无缝钢管厂、轧钢厂和炼焦厂。在有色金属冶炼方面，今年还新建六个规模达一千七百吨的小炼铜炉，四个规模达一千二百吨的小炼铅、锌厂。计划今年就可生产八万五千吨生铁、四百四十吨铜和二百七十吨铅、锌，明年就可生产普通钢三万吨到五万吨、合金钢一万五千吨和无缝钢管七千吨。陕西省还决定要充分利用西安原有的机械修配工业基础，改建和新建一批动力机械制造厂，今年就能生产水利机械、发电机、拖拉机、普通车床等成套的设备。此外，还决定抽换西安的一些车床，在陕南、陕北等地建立七个综合性的中型机械厂，争取大部分县建立起小型修配厂。这样，加上关中地区已有的汽车修理厂和拖拉机修配站，便形成了以西安为中心的地方机械制造和修配网。为了今后能够自给液体燃料，今年将在陕北和渭北地区建设一批小型页岩油和煤炼油厂。
    陕西省在进行全面安排工业布局中，还考虑到地区之间的协作平衡和先后建设顺序。同时，还考虑到西北五省（自治区）的协作要求，瞻前顾后地注意长远的工业分布。目前，已大体确定西安到宝鸡铁路沿线，主要发展机械、电力、化工、纺织等工业；渭北和陕北主要是发展煤和矿物油等燃料；陕南主要是发展各种金属冶炼工业。（附图片）
