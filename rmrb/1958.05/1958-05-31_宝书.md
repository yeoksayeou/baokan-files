    Precious Book
    Ding Li
    I just came home from work, my seven-year-old son rushed into my arms,
    He took out a small red book from my pocket,
    Holding it in his hands, he looked at it for a while.
    Then he rubbed it against his rosy cheeks;
    Then, imitating his father,
    He put it in his little pocket.
    I said, "This is a precious book,
    You love it and I love it!
    The lacquered cloth cover, you can't wear it out even if you touch it."
    He raised his head and asked me:
    "Dad is an adult,
    The little book should be given to children."
    I told him:
    Every word in this book,
    Shines like the sun.
    Since we had this book,
    The Chinese people have stood up.
    It brings happiness to the children,
    It brings joy to the elderly;
    It guides us to leap forward to socialism,
    And also to the future of communism...
    Little darling!
    You can't understand it now,
    Wait until you grow up and buy it yourself.
    The world at that time,
    Will be a hundred times stronger than now,
    Labor will all be done by machines,
    Electric lights will bloom like red flowers everywhere...
    The child smiled,
    And returned the Party Charter to my pocket:
    "Dad, I understand!
    This is really a precious book,
    You love it and I love it!"

    宝书
    丁力我刚下班回家来，七岁的儿子扑我怀，他从我的口袋里，掏出本红色小书来，捧在手上看一会。又挨了挨红润的脸腮；然后学着爸爸样，装进他的小口袋。我说：“这是一本宝书，你爱我也爱！漆布的封面，摸也摸不坏。”他扬着头反问我：“爸爸是大人，小书应该给小孩。”我告诉他：这本书上每个字，都像太阳闪光彩。自从有了这本书，中国人民才站起来。它给孩子们送来了幸福，它给老年人带来了愉快；它指导我们向社会主义跃进，还要到共产主义的未来……小乖乖！你现在还看不懂，等长大了自己买。那时的世界呀，比现在还要强百倍，劳动都是用机器，电灯像红花遍地开……孩子笑了，把党章送还我口袋：“爸爸，我懂了！这真是一本宝书，你爱我也爱！”
