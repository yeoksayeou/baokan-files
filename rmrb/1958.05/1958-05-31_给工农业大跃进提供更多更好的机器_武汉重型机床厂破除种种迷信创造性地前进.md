To provide more and better machines for the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture

Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant Overcomes All Superstitions and Advances Creatively

(Our report) “Complete construction one year ahead of schedule and start production three years ahead of schedule” is the bold statement of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant, which is under construction, and it has already been realized and is being realized. According to the original plan, this plant would not be completed until the end of 1959 and would not officially begin production until 1960. But according to the current construction speed, it can be basically completed by July this year. As for production, it began at the end of 1956. In that year, trial production of three types of heavy machine tools began. In 1957, the output value of nearly 3 million yuan was produced. This year, it is planned to produce eleven varieties with a total value of 30 million yuan.

What is the main experience of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant in organizing the Great Leap Forward in production during construction? The answer is: to organize production by using all possible conditions during construction, to promote construction through production, to seize time to create value, to break with conventions, to proceed from reality, and to be bold in creation.

"Using land to train soldiers"

Like other capital construction factories, this plant sent a group of cadres and workers to fraternal factories to learn production technology during the construction process. However, this plant is different in that it used the factory buildings and equipment of fraternal factories, and the people sent by its own factory made their own tools and fixtures, using other people's places, and trial-produced the products that their own factory would produce in the future. For example, they made two 1556 vertical lathes in Qiqihar First Machine Tool Plant; they trial-produced two 2630 boring machines in Shenyang First Machine Tool Plant; and they trial-produced 7242A gantry planers in Jinan Second Machine Tool Plant. In this way, they accumulated experience for the production of formal products and laid a solid foundation for future production.

Want to "marry and have children"
Don't want to "isolate and sleep forever"

During the construction process, this plant first built a tool workshop, a repair workshop, and a model warehouse, and a part of the larger equipment arrived first. Can these devices that arrive first be temporarily installed in the model warehouse for production? In other words, should the existing buildings and equipment "marry and have children," or should they be allowed to "isolate and sleep forever?" This question caused controversy in the factory. Among the cadres, only a few people agreed with the "marry and have children" approach. The leaders of the factory insisted on adopting the "marry and have children" method. Unfortunately, a gust of retreat-promoting wind blew from above, saying things like "the earlier the production, the greater the loss," "it's not worth the loss," "sales are not smooth, why rush so much," and so on. As a result, discussions within the factory resumed, and the workers' emotions and enthusiasm were dampened. At this critical moment, the leaders of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry supported them. In this way, the machines were installed in the model warehouse. Now, some of the machine tools installed in the first metalworking workshop were "born" from the "marriage" of warehouses and equipment.

"Production Safety" debate
Wins over "Safe Production"

"A clever woman cannot cook without rice." It is not possible to produce with only processing machine tools. There must also be castings. However, the foundry workshop can only be built last, and the cooperating factories do not have the capacity to supply such large castings. The problem facing us is whether castings can be produced without a foundry building. The leaders of the factory decided to build temporary straw sheds for production. This decision was again opposed by those who followed the old rules. The first to raise objections was the department responsible for safety, the reason being fear of fire. As a result, a debate between "safe production" and "production safety" unfolded in the factory. As a result of the debate, those who advocated "production safety" won, and the theory of "safe production" was refuted. That is to say, for the sake of production, even if straw sheds are used, safety should and can be guaranteed, and production cannot be stopped for the sake of safety. Only in this way can straw sheds be built and casting production started.

What is "civilized production"?

When installing equipment in the production workshop, can production be carried out by utilizing one machine as soon as it is installed? Some comrades in the equipment power section and the process section said that doing so would be detrimental to the exercise of the responsibility of protecting equipment and would not conform to the process procedures stipulated in the design. In a word, it does not meet the requirements of "civilized production." They advocated waiting until all the equipment was installed, letting the workers learn the operating procedures, become familiar with the machine tools, and then carry out trial production according to the process procedures stipulated in the design. In short, in the eyes of these people, only "following the steps" and "being steady" can be regarded as "civilized production."

The first focus of the debate was who would use the machine tools? The conclusion, of course, was the workers. Then, the workers should be organized to discuss the operating procedures. But who compiled the operating procedures for the nearly sixty kinds of machine tools in this factory? They were compiled by young people who had just graduated from secondary technical schools last year, without practical operating experience and without systematic theoretical knowledge. Forcing workers to implement the operating procedures compiled in this way is not "the son teaching the mother how to raise children"?

The other focus of the debate was how to treat the process procedures stipulated in the design? Should they be kept intact, or should the workers be trusted and handed over to the workers to practice? Practice has proved that only handing it over to the workers for practice is the way out, due to different specific conditions and other reasons.

Their experience is that civilized production is not such a "mysterious" thing, but is derived from production practice. Production practice that conforms to objective reality is "civilized production."

Simultaneous construction, installation and production

Solving the ideological problems within Party A does not mean that production can be carried out on the installed machines. There are still issues with relationships between Party A, Party B, Party C, etc. Party B is responsible for building the factory buildings; Party C is responsible for installing the machines. Each has its own work sequence, requirements, and responsibilities. It seems that Party A can only wait for Party B and Party C to hand over the workshops one by one before it can use them. Otherwise, disputes will arise. As expected, disputes occurred. But they finally unified the contradictions in mutual cooperation and making it as favorable as possible to early production. Their agreement is: simultaneous construction, installation, and production. The casting workshop, which is under construction and installation, has already started producing molten iron. Entering it, at first glance, it seems that there is no order at all. In fact, the activities of construction, installation, modeling and casting are carried out in a very orderly and crosswise manner. For the convenience of construction, production workers use the night to melt iron. In this way, 15,000 tons of molten iron will be produced this year (the designed capacity is only 25,000 tons per year).

Because this factory is carrying out both capital construction and organizing the Great Leap Forward in production, it can complete the factory construction task one year ahead of schedule, saving 30 to 40 million yuan of investment compared to the original plan, and at the same time produce 30 types of heavy machine tools and 120 million yuan of wealth for the country in advance.

    给工农业大跃进提供更多更好的机器
    武汉重型机床厂破除种种迷信创造性地前进
    本报讯　“提前一年建成，提前三年生产”是正在建设中的武汉重型机床厂的豪语，并且已经实现和正在实现。这个厂按原计划要到1959年底才能建成，1960年才能正式投入生产。但按照现在的建设速度，到今年7月就可以基本建成。至于生产，从1956年底就开始了，当年开始试制三种重型机床，1957年生产了近三百万元产值，今年计划生产十一个品种，总值三千万元。
    武汉重型机床厂在建设中组织生产大跃进的主要经验是什么？答复是：在建设中利用一切可能利用的条件组织生产，用生产来推动建设，抢时间创造价值，打破常规，从实际出发，大胆创造。
    “借地练兵”
    像其他基建工厂一样，这个厂在建设过程中，派了一批干部和工人到兄弟厂去学习生产技术。但是，这个厂有一点与众不同，就是利用兄弟厂的厂房和设备，由自己厂派出去的人做了自用的工卡具，借用别人的地方，试制了自己工厂将来生产的产品。如他们在齐齐哈尔第一机床厂做了两台1556型立式车床；在沈阳第一机床厂试制了两台2630型搪床；在济南第二机床厂试制了7242A型龙门刨床。这样，他们就为生产正规产品积累了经验，为将来开工生产打下了坚实的基础。
  要“结婚生子”
  不要“隔离长眠”
    这个厂在建设过程中，先建了工具车间、修理车间和模型仓库，并先到了一部分较大型的设备。能不能将这些先到达的设备临时安装在模型仓库进行生产？也就是说，让已有的建筑物和设备“结婚生子”呢，还是让它们“隔离长眠”？这个问题，在工厂里引起了争论。在干部中，只有少数人赞成“结婚生子”的做法。厂的领导硬是决定采取“结婚生子”的办法。不巧，上边刮来了一阵促退的歪风，说什么“生产越早，损失越大”，“得不偿失”，“销路不畅，何急如此”等等。于是，厂内议论复起，工人的情绪和干劲受到了挫伤。在这紧急关头，第一机械工业部的领导支持了他们。这样，模型仓库才安装上了机器。现在，安装在第一金工车间的机床中，有些就是由仓库和设备“结婚”而“生”出来的。“生产安全”论战
  胜“安全生产”论
    “巧妇难为无米之炊”，光有加工的机床是不能生产的，还得有铸件。但是，铸工车间却在最后才能建起，协作厂又没有能力供应这样大铸件。摆在面前的问题是没有铸工厂房能不能生产铸件？厂的领导决定搭草席棚临时进行生产。这个决定又遭到按旧规矩走路的人的反对。首先提出不同意见的是负责安全的部门，理由是怕起火。于是，在厂里展开了“安全生产”和“生产安全”的争辩。辩论的结果，是“生产安全”论者胜利了，“安全生产”论被驳倒了。就是说，为了生产，就是用草席棚，也应当而且可以设法保证安全，不能为了安全而不生产。这样才搭起了草席棚，开始了铸件生产。
  何谓“文明生产”？
    生产车间在安装设备的时候，能不能装好一台就利用一台进行生产？设备动力科和工艺科的一些同志说这样做不利行使保护设备的职责，不符合设计规定的工艺程序。一句话，就是不合“文明生产”的要求。他们主张等设备全部安好，让工人学好操作规程，熟悉机床，然后按设计规定的工艺程序进行试生产。总之，在这些人的眼光里，只有“按部就班”，“四平八稳”才算是“文明生产”。
    争辩的第一个中心是什么人使用机床？结论当然是工人。那末就应当把有关工人组织起来，讨论操作规程。但是这个厂近六十种机床的操作规程又是什么人编出来的呢？是去年刚从中等技术学校毕业的没有实际操作经验、没有系统的理论知识的青年编的。这样编出来的操作规程，硬要工人去执行，岂不是“儿子教妈妈养孩子”吗？
    争辩的另一个中心是如何对待设计规定的工艺程序？原封不动呢，还是相信工人，交给工人去实践？实践证明：由于具体条件不同等原因，只有交给工人去实践才是出路。
    他们的体验是：文明生产并不是那么“神秘”的东西，而是由生产实践中得出来的。切合客观实际的生产实践，就是“文明生产”。
    边施工、边安装、边生产
    解决了甲方内部的思想问题，并不等于就可以在安装的机器上进行生产了。问题还有甲、乙、丙等方面的关系。乙方是负责把厂房建好；丙方是负责把机器安好。各有各的工作次序、要求和职责。看样子，甲方只有等待乙、丙两方逐车间地交接才能动用了。否则，就会引起争论。果然，争论发生了。但他们终于把矛盾统一于相互配合、尽可能有利于及早生产上面去。他们的协议是：边施工、边安装、边生产。现在正在施工和安装的铸造车间已经开始出铁水了。一进去，乍看起来好像是毫无秩序。其实，施工、安装、造型浇铸等活动是很有秩序地交叉进行着的。为了施工方便，生产工人利用夜间来化铁水。这样，今年就要生产一万五千吨铁水（设计能力一年也不过两万五千吨）。
    这个工厂因为一面进行基本建设，一面组织生产大跃进，所以能够提前一年完成建厂任务，比最初计划还节省了三、四千万元的投资，同时提前给国家生产出三十种重型机床和一亿二千万元的财富。（附图片）
