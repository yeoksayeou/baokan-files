    Achieving Leap Forward Targets

    The leading bodies of Shanxi Province, based on the situation that many counties' grain and cotton production plans are striving to achieve the targets stipulated in the Outline this year, conducted a focused inspection of the production work in twenty-two counties. They found that one-third of the counties' measures for increasing production were lagging behind the targets. Therefore, they immediately provided specific guidance to the work of these counties, and the responsible cadres also personally went down to help solve problems. This leadership method powerfully promoted the work!

    The leaders and the broad masses of these counties in Shanxi originally had the determination for a great leap forward, and these regions also possessed the various conditions for realizing the leap forward. After this inspection, Guo County reversed the phenomenon of slowness and procrastination, and launched a vigorous large-scale water conservancy project, with an average daily progress exceeding six times that of the past, which is a very good proof. There are many reasons why the potential of these counties was not brought into play for a time, but it is also a fact that the cadres lacked methods and experience in organizing large-scale production increases. Therefore, once they can get specific help from above at this critical moment, they can make obvious achievements.

    More than 1,100 counties and cities across the country are planning to achieve the Outline targets for grain and cotton this year, and everyone is paying great attention to them. We hope that all localities can also conduct a special inspection of their production situation.

    实现跃进指标
    山西省领导机关根据今年有许多县粮棉生产计划争取实现纲要规定指标的情况，集中检查了二十二个县的生产工作，发现有三分之一的县增产措施落后于指标，便立即对这些县的工作作了具体的指导，负责干部也亲自下去帮助解决问题。这种领导方法很有力地推动了工作！
    山西这些县的领导人和广大群众本来都是有大跃进的决心的，而这些地区也是存在着实现跃进的各种条件的。崞县在经过这次检查之后，一反迟缓拖沓的现象，轰轰烈烈大修水利，平均每日进度超过以前六倍就是很好的证明。这些县的潜力一时没有发挥出来，原因虽多，但干部缺乏组织大增产的办法和经验也是事实。所以，一旦在这紧要的时刻能得到上面的具体帮助，他们就能作出明显的成绩来。
    今年全国计划粮棉实现纲要指标的县市已有一千一百多个，大家对他们予以很大的注意。他们的生产情况怎样，希望各地也能专门检查一遍。
