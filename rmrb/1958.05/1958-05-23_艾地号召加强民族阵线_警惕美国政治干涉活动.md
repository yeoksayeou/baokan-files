Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 21st: Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, said that attention should be paid to the recent activities of the United States.

Aidit said that the United States has recently strengthened its political interference in Indonesia, in addition to continuing its armed interference. He pointed out that after the failure of the United States to instigate a rebellion by the "Revolutionary Government" by utilizing certain figures from the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party, it is now looking for other methods, namely, attempting to contact certain Nationalists in Indonesia and trying to approach members of the armed forces.

Aidit made these remarks in a speech delivered on the 16th to officers and government officials in Pontianak, leaders of local political parties and mass organizations, and people from other walks of life. The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party published this speech on the 21st.

Aidit said that Indonesian Nationalists and soldiers have proper self-esteem and will certainly reject the American plot to establish an "anti-communist" cabinet in Indonesia.

Aidit said that in order to resist the aggression of the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan and to thwart the American policy of division, the current task is to strengthen the united national front and the unity of religious parties, nationalist parties, and communist parties, as well as their supporters.

He said that he could not agree with the policy of dissolving political parties, because this would mean disarming progressives and destroying the democratic system that Indonesia has long pursued. In addition, any group would therefore be able to take this opportunity to launch a coup and seize national power.

He said that the most important thing at present is to unite all parties and groups into a national front in order to realize the demands of the August Revolution of 1945. Various parties can engage in peaceful competition within the national front in terms of putting forward constructive suggestions and serving the people.

Speaking of the attitude towards the Masyumi Party, Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party would not demand the dissolution of the Masyumi Party, but would require the Masyumi Party to sanction those of its leaders who participated in the rebellion of the "Revolutionary Government" and return to the road of national unity. He said that if the Masyumi Party can do this, the Indonesian Communist Party is still willing to cooperate with it on the basis of the Sukarno plan. Aidit said that otherwise, "only a madman would be willing to see the Masyumi Party regain power."

Speaking of the current international situation, Aidit once again expressed his agreement with the foreign policy of peaceful coexistence chosen by Prime Minister Djuanda. He warned that in the current international situation, if the United States forcibly launches a war, it will be the first to taste the bitter fruit of war.

### 艾地号召加强民族阵线  警惕美国政治干涉活动

    艾地号召加强民族阵线
    警惕美国政治干涉活动
    据新华社雅加达21日电　印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地说，对美国最近的活动应该加以注意。
    艾地说，美国最近除了继续在印度尼西亚进行武装干涉外，还加强了政治干涉。他指出，美国在利用马斯友美党和社会党的某些人物发动“革命政府”的叛乱失败以后，现在正在寻找其他的方法，也就是企图同印度尼西亚某些国民党人接触，并且试图接近武装部队人士。
    艾地是在16日向坤甸的军官和政府官员、当地的政党和群众团体的领导人以及其他各界人士发表的一篇讲话中说这番话的。印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会书记处在21日发表了这篇讲话。
    艾地说，印度尼西亚的国民党人和军人有适当的自尊心，必然会拒绝美国企图在印度尼西亚建立“反共”内阁的阴谋。
    艾地说，为了抵抗美国和台湾蒋介石集团的侵略并且挫败美国的分裂政策，目前的任务是加强民族统一阵线以及宗教政党、民族主义政党和共产主义政党以及它们的支持者的团结。
    他说，他不能同意解散政党的政策，因为这意味着解除进步人士的武装和破坏印度尼西亚很久以来所追求的民主制度；此外，任何集团都会因此有可能利用这个机会发动政变和夺取国家政权。
    他说，目前最重要的事情是把一切党派和团体团结到民族阵线中去，以便实现1945年8月革命的要求；各党派可以在民族阵线中在提出建设性建议和为人民服务方面展开和平竞赛。
    艾地在谈到对马斯友美党的态度时说，印度尼西亚共产党不会要求解散马斯友美党，而是要求马斯友美党制裁它的那些参与“革命政府”的叛乱活动的领袖，并且重新走上民族团结的道路。他说，如果马斯友美党能够这样做，印度尼西亚共产党仍然愿意在苏加诺方案的基础上同它进行合作。艾地说，否则的话，“只有疯子才愿意看到马斯友美党重新掌握政权”。
    在谈到当前的国际局势时，艾地再次表示同意朱安达总理所选择的和平共处的外交政策。他警告说，在目前的国际形势下，假如美国强行发动战争，它会首先尝到战争的恶果。
