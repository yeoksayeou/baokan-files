　　Household Registration Work Shines
　　Yang Laobu, a 65-year-old man, visited his nephew Hao Zhensheng in Sanlihe, Fuchengmenwai, Beijing in 1954. At that time, there were only two buildings in Sanlihe. But this time when he came to find his nephew, Sanlihe had completely changed, with buildings standing tall and streets crisscrossing everywhere. Yang Laobu, with his little granddaughter Lifang, searched and searched for a long time but couldn't find him. In the end, the old man went to the police station to ask for help. In less than a quarter of an hour, the household registration police officer Li Min found his nephew's residence.

　　户籍工作大放异采
    六十五岁的老人杨老补，一九五四年曾到北京阜外大街三里河看望过他的外甥郝振声。那时，三里河只有两幢楼房。可是这次来找他外甥时，三里河完全变样了，到处楼房林立、街道纵横。杨老补带着他的小孙女丽芳找来找去，找了好久怎么也找不到。最后老人到派出所去请求帮助。不到一刻钟，户籍警李敏就查到了他外甥的住处。
