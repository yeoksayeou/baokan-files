    Nixon's Trip to Latin America
    Zhang Ye
    Under the pressure of the strong anti-American demonstrations by the people of Latin American countries, especially the people of Venezuela, U.S. Vice President Nixon ended his "goodwill visit" to Latin America one day early and returned to Washington on May 15.
    Although Eisenhower and Dulles personally went to the airport to "welcome and comfort" the Vice President in order to "calm" him, and said that Nixon's trip was "very effective, efficient, and dignified," even Nixon himself could not deny that "some unpleasant events occurred during this trip."
    The U.S. ruling group was not unaware that the seeds of hatred they had sown in Latin America would reap the fruits they deserved during Nixon's "visit." Eisenhower once publicly admitted that "the United States anticipated some demonstrations against Nixon in Latin America," but he then said, "but never thought of canceling the trip." Since they anticipated it, why did they let Nixon bite the bullet, get beaten and scolded, and make a fool of himself? The answer needs to be sought in the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries.
    Because the United States has always regarded Latin American countries as its own "backyard," carrying out brutal economic plunder, political interference, and military control at will, the national contradiction between Latin American countries and U.S. monopoly capital and its agents has become the main contradiction on this continent. Since the outbreak of the U.S. economic crisis, this contradiction has become even more acute.
    Economic brutal exploitation and the struggle against exploitation are the most important aspect of the national contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries. Because the United States monopolizes the foreign trade of Latin America, implements "buying cheap and selling dear," and restricts Latin American countries from developing trade relations with socialist countries, the foreign trade deficits of Latin American countries are increasing, and their economies are in trouble. After the outbreak of the U.S. economic crisis, the United States reduced and restricted the quantity of imports from Latin America, which caused the market prices of Latin American raw materials to fall, exports to plummet, gold and foreign exchange to dry up, prices to rise, and people's lives to be extremely difficult. For example, the price of coffee, which accounts for 60% to 85% of the total exports of Brazil, Colombia, El Salvador, and Guatemala, has been falling. According to the "New York Post," every one-cent decrease in the price of coffee per pound will cost Brazil $19 million and Colombia $7 million annually. A year ago, the price of coffee in New York was $0.78 per pound, but now it is $0.48 per pound, a huge drop, and the losses of these countries that rely on coffee exports can be imagined. The sharp drop in non-ferrous metal prices has also caused great losses to countries such as Chile, Peru, Bolivia, and Mexico. Not only that, but the U.S. government has further cut Venezuela's oil import quota by 15% and is preparing to raise import taxes on lead, zinc, tin, and restore copper, which is another blow to the economies of Latin American countries. This U.S. practice of further squeezing Latin American countries has aroused strong opposition from a wide range of people in Latin American countries.
    The national contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries is also manifested in the U.S. ruling group's efforts to interfere in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, support and support the dictatorial regimes and reactionary forces in these countries, and suppress patriotic and democratic forces. For example, in the recent struggle of the Cuban people against the Batista dictatorial regime, the United States, on the one hand, hypocritically refused to supply the Cuban government with weapons, and on the other hand, supplied Batista with weapons through the Dominican dictator, and the U.S. military delegation in Cuba directed the Cuban army to fight, and several loyal lackeys were kept in Washington as Batista's reserve. The purpose of the United States is to hope that the situation in Cuba will continue to be chaotic, so as to eliminate as many leaders of all democratic movements as possible and find excuses to launch armed intervention.
    In addition, the United States is also trying its best to link the Organization of American States with the aggressive North Atlantic Treaty Organization in order to further tie Latin American countries to the U.S. war chariot. This is also a factor that deepens the national contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries.
    On the one hand, the United States is stepping up its plunder and exploitation of Latin American countries, and on the other hand, because the world situation has undergone a turning point in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, the national independence movements in Asia and Africa are flourishing, and the people of Latin America are increasingly awakened. Some new trends that are conducive to striving for national independence and democratic freedom have emerged throughout the Latin American continent. First of all, the people of Latin America strongly demand to get rid of U.S. exploitation, enslavement, and control. The anti-American struggle of the Latin American people is inseparable from the struggle for democracy. The people's movements for democracy and against dictatorship in Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Colombia, Cuba, and Paraguay are powerful, and mass anti-American and anti-dictatorship struggles are vigorously developing. Communist parties and workers' movements have also made great progress, and many countries have established national democratic united fronts. Under the pressure of such a powerful people's movement, some dictatorial regimes in Latin American countries supported by the United States have collapsed one after another since last year. At the same time, the movements in these countries demanding the restoration and development of diplomatic and trade relations with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are also developing; the advocacy of neutralist economic and diplomatic policies has gained the upper hand in some countries. The newly elected Argentine President Frondizi is preparing to form a "group of moderate left-wing countries" with Bolivia, Chile, and Venezuela. Under such circumstances, the movement of the Latin American people demanding peace, opposing nuclear weapons tests, opposing the establishment of a South Atlantic Treaty, and opposing the combination of the Organization of American States with the North Atlantic Treaty Group is also developing.
    All these situations show that the political influence of the United States in Latin America is declining, just as the Americans themselves say, "a continent is burning," and "the relationship between the United States and Latin American countries has now reached its lowest point in twenty-five years, and the barometer is still declining."
    The "mission" of Nixon's trip to Latin America was to ease the growing anti-American sentiment in the region; to "explain" the U.S. policy toward Latin American countries; to restore the U.S. "prestige" in Latin America; and to discuss the so-called "common interests," mainly economic issues, with the eight countries he visited.
    However, due to the new trends in Latin America and the sharpening of contradictions between the United States and Latin American countries, Nixon not only did not complete his "mission," but on the contrary, he encountered strong anti-American demonstrations everywhere, the anti-American sentiment on the Latin American continent became more rampant, the U.S. "prestige" was even more swept away, and the so-called "common interests" issues he prepared to discuss did not yield any results.
    According to foreign news reports, the main economic issues that Nixon wanted to discuss were nothing more than the establishment of a Latin American common market with U.S. participation to ensure the safety of U.S. investment, and to "explain" to Latin American countries the recent and prepared restrictions on imports and increases in tariffs.
    The issue of establishing a Latin American common market was originally raised for discussion at a meeting of experts from six countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Ecuador, and Colombia, invited by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America in early February this year. This meeting was actually convened under the instruction of the United States. During this trip, Nixon publicly advocated at press conferences held in Paraguay and Ecuador that "the United States welcomes the proposal to establish a Latin American market similar to the European Common Market." The reason why the United States is interested in this issue is that, on the one hand, the sentiment of Latin America demanding national independence and anti-Americanism is increasing, making the U.S. practice of giving orders and extorting increasingly resisted in Latin America, and on the other hand, the U.S. economic crisis is becoming more and more serious, and it is eager to shift it to Latin America to alleviate its own difficulties. Latin American countries have long seen through this conspiracy of the United States. At the meeting convened by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America in February this year, most countries opposed the U.S. "common market" plan, believing that this regional market controlled by the United States would only worsen the economies of Latin American countries and make these countries more dependent on the United States. Therefore, Nixon's lobbying did not receive any positive response. Moreover, Argentine President Frondizi visited Brazil before taking office and reached an agreement on the economic unification of Argentina and Brazil, and planned to use this as the core to organize its own common market of Latin American countries that adopted a common economic policy to get rid of U.S. plunder and control. This plan is attracting the interest of other Latin American countries, which makes the U.S.-made "common market" even less marketable.
    The second is the issue of Latin American countries falling into economic difficulties and requesting loans from the United States. According to foreign news reports, Argentina requested the U.S. government to grant a loan to the Argentine national petroleum monopoly, but was rejected; Ecuador submitted to Nixon a list of Ecuador's hope to obtain assistance from the United States, but there was no follow-up. In several public speeches, Nixon repeatedly emphasized that "government loans will not be given where private capital can be obtained"; "if there are appropriate conditions for attracting investors, more private investment can be obtained." Everyone can see that the "appropriate conditions" mentioned by Nixon are nothing more than requiring Latin American countries to further cede their national sovereignty to U.S. monopoly capital so that they can extract more profits. Under the circumstances of the rising Latin American national movement, this plan of U.S. monopoly capital is of course difficult to succeed.
    In addition, Nixon also "explained" to several countries he visited the U.S. policy of restricting imports and preparing to raise tariffs. However, as Nixon said at Washington Airport, "we (referring to the United States) did not succeed" in this regard.
    The powerful demonstrations of the people of Latin American countries against Nixon's visit clearly showed the bankruptcy of U.S. imperialism's colonial policy in Latin America. In particular, the U.S. government actually sent 1,000 Marines and paratroopers to the Caribbean base, preparing to carry out armed intervention in Venezuela, which further exposed the ugly face of imperialism, thus inevitably arousing stronger opposition from the Latin American people.
    After Nixon returned to Washington, he immediately held talks with Eisenhower and Dulles, saying that "the United States must re-evaluate its policy toward Latin America," and he believed that Latin America had "risen from a very important place it has always occupied to a position that should be given the highest priority." There is also news that there will be personnel changes within the Latin American Affairs Bureau of the U.S. State Department, including the replacement of some ambassadors. This, of course, does not mean that the United States will really change its policy of controlling and enslaving Latin America, but will adopt a more insidious and vicious policy with some beautiful coats. However, this will not have any other result except to deepen the national contradiction between the United States and Latin American countries and arouse the more rampant anti-American struggle of the Latin American people.

    尼克松的拉丁美洲之行
    章叶
    美国副总统尼克松在拉丁美洲各国人民，特别是委内瑞拉人民强大的反美大示威的压力下，提前一天结束了他在拉丁美洲的“亲善访问”，于5月15日回到了华盛顿。
    尽管艾森豪威尔、杜勒斯为了给这位副总统“压惊”，亲自到机场去“欢迎、慰问”，并且说尼克松的这次旅行“做得很有效果，很有效率，也很体面”，但是，连尼克松自己也不能否认“在这次旅行期间发生了一些令人不愉快的事件”。
    美国统治集团不是不知道他们在拉丁美洲播下的仇恨种子，会在尼克松“访问”的时候收获到应得的果实的。艾森豪威尔就曾公开承认，“美国预料到在拉丁美洲会发生一些反对尼克松的示威”，可是，他紧接着又说，“但是从来没有想到取消这次旅行。”既然料到了，为什么又让尼克松硬着头皮去挨打受骂、丢人出丑呢？这需要从美国同拉丁美洲国家的关系中去寻求答案。
    由于美国一向把拉丁美洲国家当作自己的“后院”，为所欲为地进行残酷的经济掠夺、政治干涉和军事控制，使拉丁美洲国家同美国垄断资本及其代理人之间的民族矛盾，成为这个大陆的主要矛盾。自从美国经济危机爆发以来，这种矛盾更加尖锐化了。
    经济上的残酷剥削和反剥削的斗争，是美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的民族矛盾的一个最主要方面。由于美国垄断了拉丁美洲的对外贸易，实行“贱买贵卖”和限制拉丁美洲国家同社会主义国家发展贸易关系，拉丁美洲国家对外贸易的逆差日益增大，经济陷于困难之中。在美国经济危机爆发后，美国又减少并限制由拉丁美洲进口的数量，这就使拉丁美洲原料的市场价格下跌，出口量锐减，黄金外汇枯竭，物价上涨，人民生活困苦万分。例如，占巴西、哥伦比亚、萨尔瓦多、危地马拉出口总额60％到85％的咖啡的价格，一直在下跌。据“纽约邮报”估计，咖啡价格每磅只降低一分，巴西每年就要损失一千九百万美元，哥伦比亚要损失七百万美元。一年以前，纽约的咖啡价格每磅是零点七八美元，而现在是零点四八美元，下跌的幅度是这样大，这些靠咖啡出口的国家的损失之大，也就可想而知了。而有色金属价格的暴跌，也使智利、秘鲁、玻利维亚、墨西哥等国受到很大损失。不仅如此，美国政府还进一步削减委内瑞拉石油进口限额15％，并准备提高铅、锌、锡和恢复铜的进口税，这对拉丁美洲国家的经济又是一个不小的打击。美国这种进一步压榨拉丁美洲国家的做法，激起了拉丁美洲各国广泛阶层人士的强烈反对。
    美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的民族矛盾，还表现在美国统治集团力图干涉拉丁美洲国家内政，扶植和支持这些国家的独裁政权和反动势力，镇压爱国民主力量上。例如，在最近古巴人民反对巴蒂斯塔独裁政权的斗争中，美国一方面假惺惺地拒绝供给古巴政府武器，另方面却又通过多米尼加独裁者供给巴蒂斯塔武器，并由美国驻古巴军事代表团指挥古巴军队作战，还在华盛顿保留几个忠实奴才作巴蒂斯塔的后备。美国的目的是希望古巴局势继续混乱，以便尽量消灭所有民主运动的领袖，并寻找借口来发动武装干涉。
    此外，美国还竭力想把美洲国家组织同侵略性的北大西洋公约组织联结在一起，以便把拉丁美洲国家进一步拴在美国的战车上。这也是美国同拉丁美洲国家之间民族矛盾加深的一个因素。
    一方面是美国加紧对拉丁美洲国家的掠夺和剥削，另一方面则由于世界局势已发生东风压倒西风的转折，亚非国家民族独立运动在蓬勃发展，拉丁美洲人民日益觉醒，整个拉丁美洲大陆出现了一些有利于争取民族独立和民主自由的新趋势。首先是拉丁美洲人民强烈要求摆脱美国的剥削、奴役和控制。拉丁美洲人民的反美斗争是同争取民主的斗争分不开的。阿根廷、智利、巴西、乌拉圭、委内瑞拉、哥伦比亚、古巴、巴拉圭人民争取民主、反对独裁的人民运动声势浩大，群众性的反美、反独裁斗争蓬勃开展，共产党和工人运动也有很大发展，许多国家建立了民族民主统一战线。在这样强大的人民运动的压力下，美国所支持的一些拉丁美洲国家的独裁政权，自去年以来一个跟着一个倒台。与此同时，这些国家要求恢复和发展同苏联和其他社会主义国家外交关系和贸易关系的运动也日益发展；奉行中立主义的经济和外交政策的主张在一些国家里占了上风。新当选的阿根廷总统弗朗迪西就正着手酝酿同玻利维亚、智利、委内瑞拉成立一个“温和左派国家集团”。在这种情况下，拉丁美洲国家人民要求和平、反对核武器试验、反对建立南大西洋公约和反对美洲国家组织同北大西洋公约集团结合的运动也日益发展。
    所有这些情况都表明，美国在拉丁美洲的政治势力正在衰退，正像美国人自己所说的，“一个大陆在燃烧着”，“美国和拉丁美洲国家间的关系现在已经达到了二十五年来的最低点，而且晴雨表还在继续下降中”。
    尼克松的拉丁美洲之行的“使命”，就是为了缓和这个地区日益增长的反美情绪；“解释”美国对拉丁美洲国家的政策；挽回美国在拉丁美洲的“威信”；同他所访问的八个国家讨论所谓“共同利益”问题，主要是经济问题。
    但是，由于拉丁美洲出现的新趋势以及美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的矛盾的尖锐化，尼克松不但没有完成他的“使命”，相反地，他到处碰到了强烈的反美示威，拉丁美洲大陆的反美情绪更加高涨了，美国的“威信”更加扫地了，而他准备讨论的所谓“共同利益”问题，也没有任何结果。
    据外电透露，尼克松所要讨论的主要经济问题，不外是建立有美国参加的拉丁美洲共同市场，以保障美国投资的安全，以及向拉丁美洲国家“解释”美国最近已经和准备采取的限制进口和提高关税等问题。
    关于建立拉丁美洲共同市场问题，本来是今年2月初由联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会邀请巴西、墨西哥、智利、阿根廷、厄瓜多尔、哥伦比亚等六个国家的专家开会提出讨论的。这次会议实际上是美国授意召开的。尼克松在这次旅行中，曾在巴拉圭和厄瓜多尔举行的记者招待会上，公开鼓吹说，“美国欢迎关于建立一个和欧洲共同市场类似的拉丁美洲国家市场的主张”。美国之所以对这个问题感兴趣，一方面是由于拉丁美洲要求民族独立和反美的情绪日益高涨，使美国在拉丁美洲发号施令、巧取豪夺的做法遭受越来越大的反抗，另方面美国的经济危机越来越严重，急着想向拉丁美洲转嫁，以减轻自己的困难。拉丁美洲国家早已识破了美国的这一阴谋。在今年2月联合国拉丁美洲经济委员会所召开的会议上，大多数国家就反对美国的“共同市场”的计划，它们认为这个由美国控制的地区市场，只会使拉丁美洲国家经济恶化，使这些国家更加依赖美国。因而尼克松这次游说也没有得到任何积极的反应。并且，阿根廷总统弗朗迪西在他就职前曾访问巴西，就阿根廷和巴西经济统一问题达成协议，并打算以此为核心酝酿组织采取共同经济政策以摆脱美国掠夺和控制的拉丁美洲国家自己的共同市场。这个计划正引起拉丁美洲其他国家的兴趣，这样就使美国制的“共同市场”更没有销路了。
    其次是关于拉丁美洲国家陷于经济困难，要求美国贷款的问题。据外电透露，阿根廷曾要求美国政府给予阿根廷国家石油垄断企业一笔贷款，但遭到了拒绝；厄瓜多尔曾交给尼克松一份厄瓜多尔希望从美国得到援助的清单，也没有下文。尼克松在几次公开谈话中都一再强调“在可以得到私人资本的地方则不给予政府贷款”；“如果有吸引投资者的适当条件，就可以得到更加多得多的私人投资”。谁都会看出，尼克松所说的这个“适当条件”不过是要拉丁美洲国家进一步对美国垄断资本出让他们的国家主权，以便它们能够榨取更多的利润。在拉丁美洲民族运动日益高涨的情况下，美国垄断资本的这种打算当然很难得逞。
    此外，尼克松还曾向他访问的几个国家“解释”美国限制进口和准备提高关税的政策。但是，正如尼克松在华盛顿机场所说的，在这方面“我们（指美国）没有成功”。
    拉丁美洲各国人民反对尼克松访问的强大示威，清楚地显示了美帝国主义在拉丁美洲的殖民政策的破产。特别是美国政府竟派遣一千名海军陆战队和伞兵开往加勒比基地，准备对委内瑞拉实行武装干涉，这就更加暴露了帝国主义的丑恶面目，从而不能不激起拉丁美洲人民更加强烈的反对。
    尼克松回到华盛顿以后，立刻同艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯进行了会谈，表示“美国必须重新估计它对拉丁美洲的政策”，他认为，拉丁美洲已经“从它所占的一向是很重要的地方升到了一种应该最优先地予以考虑的地位”。又有消息说，美国国务院的拉丁美洲事务局内部会有人事变动，包括更换一些大使。这当然并不表明美国会真的改变对拉丁美洲的控制和奴役政策，而将是采取有着某种美丽外衣的更加阴险毒辣的政策。但是，这除了加深美国同拉丁美洲国家之间的民族矛盾，激起拉丁美洲人民更加高涨的反美斗争以外，是不会有别的结果的。
