In Newspapers Across the Country

    Raise the Banner of the Technological Revolution
    The Shanxi Daily has recently strengthened its coverage of industry. On the 14th and 15th, it successively published commentaries and news about industry. The entire front page of the 14th reported on the situation of local industry in the province. The top story was the news that the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee convened a provincial conference on local industry. It also published an editorial entitled "The Question of Speed and the Question of Thought," commenting on the current situation of the great development of local industry in the province. In addition, there was a column called "A Hundred Flowers Bloom in Local Industry." The front page of the 15th reported on the news of the heroic Taiyuan working class's mass meeting of ten thousand people, which mobilized the launch of a movement of one million rationalization proposals, calling on the city's workers to march towards the technological revolution. It also published an editorial entitled "Raise the Banner of the Technological Revolution," calling on workers throughout the province to continuously improve their class consciousness, liberate their minds, and boldly innovate.

    The 17th of the Month
    There were many fresh news items in the New China Daily on the 17th. A news item on the front page reported that Yangzhong, Wujin, and Changzhou counties and cities signed a cooperation contract for summer harvesting and planting. Yangzhong County, Wujin County, and the suburbs of Changzhou City entered the busy season at different times, and all three places felt a shortage of manpower and animal power during the busy season. In order to solve this difficulty, the three places, in addition to tapping their own potential and making reasonable arrangements, also provided mutual support through consultation to ensure the timely and high-quality completion of the summer harvesting and planting plan.

    There were two columns on the second page: "Fully Utilize Wild Plants" and "Accelerate Mountain Area Construction." The former column reported that the Huaiyin area decided to develop 500,000 mu of apocynum on saline-alkali land this year, and the Xinpu Dyeing and Weaving Factory successfully trial-produced 31 kinds of rayon using wild plant fibers. The latter column reported that the Liyang County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party adopted the measure of "dispatching troops to manage the mountains" to accelerate mountain area construction, and the newspaper published a commentary on this matter.

    The top story on the third page reported that in order to meet the needs of eliminating wheat field pests and diseases in the area, the Wuyou District of Yancheng County mobilized the masses and established pesticide processing plants in every agricultural cooperative within five days, producing more than 20,000 jin of lime-sulfur mixture, which could be used to spray every mu of wheat field twice.

    Twenty-One Copper Factories
    Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County in Guizhou Province did not have a single copper factory last year, but in just four months this year, it established 21 copper factories, which can not only produce crude copper but also produce refined copper.

    A news item in the Guizhou Daily on the 12th stated that when Weining established copper factories, each factory first sent one or two cadres to quickly set up the stall, and then gradually equipped them with cadres and workers. Then, a "report technology" campaign was launched throughout the county to organize some people with expertise. They also established a "local exploration team" to conduct surveys while convening training classes for cadres and workers from various factories on the spot, so that they could identify minerals and produce. They also organized various factories to visit each other, learn from each other's strengths, and solve technical difficulties with the advanced factories leading the backward factories.

    The Guizhou Daily pointed out in the editorial "Think of Ways While Doing": Guizhou has abundant resources of non-ferrous metals such as copper, lead, zinc, and antimony, as well as steel and iron resources, and should bloom everywhere, establishing factories for whatever minerals are available. To solve the problems of cadres and technology, we must follow the path of Weining's copper factories, learning while doing, and using factories to lead factories.

    A Red and Expert Branch School
    Good examples at the grassroots level are endless. On the 16th, the Jiangxi Daily introduced the experience of the Pinghu Township Party Committee in Jishui County in establishing a "three-in-one" (political, cultural, and technical) branch school in considerable detail and published a short commentary. Since its establishment in February 1957, this school has always adhered to the learning system of attending two party classes and one cultural class every month on the 10th, regardless of whether it is busy or not. The teachers are selected from the township's party member cadres. The students have also expanded from party members to members of the Communist Youth League and grassroots cadres (including team and group leaders). The teaching methods have achieved "three combinations" - combining central tasks, combining ideological realities, and combining work needs. Therefore, it has not only significantly improved the ideological awareness of party members and cadres, but also greatly promoted work and production. The short commentary said: This is the path for grassroots party members and cadres to be both red and expert.

专栏：在各地报纸上

    在各地报纸上
    扛起技术革命的大旗
    山西日报近来加强了对工业的报道，14、15两日连续发表了有关工业的评论和新闻。14日一版整版报道全省地方工业的情况。头条是中共山西省委和省人委召开全省地方工业会议的消息，还发了题为“速度问题和思想问题”的社论，评述当前全省地方工业大发展的情况。另外，还有一个“地方工业百花齐放”的专栏。15日一版报道了英雄的太原市工人阶级万人大会的消息，这次大会要动员开展百万件合理化建议运动，号召全市职工向技术革命大进军。还发表了题为“扛起技术革命的大旗”的社论，号召全省工人不断提高阶级自觉，人人思想解放，个个大胆革新。
    17日这一天
    17日的新华日报上有许多新鲜的消息。一版有一条消息报道扬中、武进、常州三个县、市签订了夏收夏种协作合同。扬中县、武进县和常州市郊区进入大忙的时间不同，而在大忙期间三地都感到人力、畜力缺乏。为了解决这个困难，三地除自己挖掘潜力、合理安排外，又通过协商，相互支援，保证按时按质完成夏收夏种计划。
    二版有两个专栏：充分利用野生植物和加速山区建设。前一个专栏里报道了淮阴地区决定今年在盐碱地上发展罗布麻五十万亩和新浦染织厂利用野生植物纤维试制成功三十一种人造棉。后一个专栏报道了中共溧阳县委为加快山区建设，采取“调兵管山”的措施，报纸并就这事发了评论。
    三版头条报道：盐城县伍佑区为了满足当地消灭麦田病虫害的需要，发动群众，在五天内使每个农业社建立了农药加工厂，已制出石灰硫磺合剂二万多斤，可供每亩麦田喷洒两遍。
    二十一个铜厂
    贵州省威宁彝族回族苗族自治县，去年连一个铜厂也没有，今年短短的四个月里，就办起了二十一个铜厂，不但能生产粗铜，而且能生产精铜。
    12日贵州日报的一篇新闻中说，威宁办铜厂的时候，每个厂先派一两个干部，迅速把摊子铺开，然后再陆续配备干部和工人。接着在全县范围内开展“报技术”的活动，把一些有专长的人组织起来。他们还成立了“土勘探队”，一边勘察，一边就地召集各厂干部和工人开办训练班，做到能识矿，能生产。又组织各厂互相参观，取长补短，先进厂带后进厂，解决技术困难。
    贵州日报在社论“办当中想办法”中指出：贵州各地有着丰富的铜、铅、锌、锑等有色金属和钢、铁资源，应该遍地开花，有什么矿藏就办什么厂。解决干部和技术问题，就要走威宁办铜厂的道路，边办边学，以厂带厂。
    一所红专的支部学校
    基层中的好典型无穷尽。16日江西日报上，以相当大的篇幅，介绍了吉水县平湖乡党委会创办“三合一”（政治、文化、技术合一）支部学校的经验，并发表了短评。这所学校从1957年2月创办以来，无论是大忙小忙，始终坚持每月逢十上两次党课、一次文化课的学习制度。教员是从乡党员干部中推选出来的。学员也由党员扩展到团员和基层干部（包括队、组长）。教学方法则做到了“三结合”——结合中心任务、结合思想实际、结合工作需要。因而，不仅显著地提高了党员和干部的思想觉悟，同时也大大促进了工作和生产。短评中说：这是基层党员、干部又红又专的道路。
