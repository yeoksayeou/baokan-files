After Rebutting the "Industrial Backwardness Theory"
By our reporter Zhang Ming

Have the local industrial products of Lanzhou improved? Many people are probably still in the dark about this. To explain this issue, we might as well revisit the mass parade in Lanzhou during the "May Day" holiday. On that day, the workers' contingent showcased a wide variety of new products, from machine-made to handcrafted items, a truly dazzling array. When the "May Day" tractor and seven-row seeder, trial-produced by the Gansu Farm Tool Factory, and the "Leap Forward" tractor, trial-produced by the Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory, rumbled past the podium, the entire venue erupted in cheers. According to a recent statistic from Lanzhou's industrial sector, local industries (including handicrafts) have successfully trial-produced over 600 new products in the first four months of this year. Among them are tractors, seeders, large-scale water pumps, artificial rain-inducing devices, etc., for agricultural production; and gramophones, telephone conference amplifiers, chain-calculators, reed organs, etc., for daily use. Some people always believe that Lanzhou's industrial products are of poor quality and high price, and are unwilling to buy them. In fact, the old calendar should no longer be consulted. Lanzhou's past industrial products were generally of poorer quality (although some were better), but in recent months, product quality has improved rapidly. The leather shoes produced by the Lanzhou Leather Shoe Factory have caught up with the famous Shanghai brands. The No. 15 uniform fabric and jacquard blankets produced by the Northwest Wool Textile Mill have reached advanced domestic levels. In the city's handicraft production, hundreds of types of woodenware, musical instruments, and pottery utensils have reached the national level. The planes manufactured by the First Ironware Production Cooperative are of the same quality as those from other places, but much cheaper.

The "Industrial Backwardness Theory" has long been prevalent in the Lanzhou area. People with this view believe that Lanzhou's industry is small in scale, with simple equipment and low technology, making it difficult to produce new products and high-quality products. However, at times, they also exhibit a kind of blind complacency, saying, "Things are much better now than in the past, how much more can they be improved?" This thought of impossibility to advance and unnecessity to advance is like two small feet, tightly binding Lanzhou's local industry, keeping it in a state of awkwardness for a long time. In the past, in the industrial sector, one often heard managers sighing and saying, "A rotten mess, rotten machines, no hope." The Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory workers once successfully trial-produced four types of pistons, and after inspection, the quality fully met the standards. However, an industrial leader poured cold water on the workers: "You are in the repair industry, not the manufacturing industry, you can't order from outside." The workers of the Jianxi Iron Factory once proposed to trial-produce an electric waterwheel, but an industrial leader said: "You can only trial-produce coarse ones, not fine ones." This infuriated the workers, who voluntarily gave up their rest time and experimented continuously, and as a result, both coarse and fine ones were successfully trial-produced. Some people are stubbornly prejudiced against local products, and regardless of whether they are good or bad, they refuse to buy them. Some units even went to Beijing and Shanghai to print report forms, meal tickets, and engrave official seals. In the past, the trade departments were not very interested in local goods. Someone gave them three sentences: "People are in Lanzhou, eyes are on Shanghai, legs are in Tianjin." At one time, regardless of the size of the supplies, they were all transported from other places. Vermicelli and brooms were shipped from Shanghai, and hoe handles were shipped from Northeast China. There is a joke: the glass cups produced by the Lanzhou Glass Factory traveled to Tianjin and back to Lanzhou, where they were wholesaled by the trade department. Once, a customer bought a hat at a department store and asked the salesperson: "Where is this hat made?" The answer was: "Made in Shanghai." Coincidentally, this sentence was heard by the handicraft cooperative member who made the hat. Upon questioning, the salesperson changed his tune and said: "We made it in imitation of Shanghai."

As soon as the Double-Anti Movement began, the workers of Lanzhou launched a ruthless exposure and criticism of the "Industrial Backwardness Theory." In April, at the Lanzhou Municipal Party Congress, this right-leaning conservative thought was again subjected to concentrated criticism. At that time, an industrial product exhibition was organized, displaying more than 2,000 industrial products, including both local and foreign products. The representatives visited and discussed in small groups for comparison. The industrial and commercial departments argued fiercely. The industrial departments said: Our products are good, why don't you promote them? The commercial departments said: Your goods just can't catch up with foreign goods. However, after a few days of the large-scale commodity exhibition, both the commercial and industrial departments exposed their "Industrial Backwardness Theory" thinking and had to admit that they had not been well-connected in the past. The commercial departments have realized that many of the five or six hundred products arranged by the industrial departments this time are indeed of good quality, but they did not know much about them in the past. The three exhibition rooms arranged separately by the commercial system this time displayed more than 1,500 kinds of goods, of which more than 80% were selected as superior goods from other places, while local goods were not only few, but also selected as inferior goods. This was actually a major exposure of the commercial departments' thinking. As for the self-deprecating and self-satisfied mentality of the industrial departments, the argument between the department store and the Lanzhou Wool Textile Mill can be taken as an example. At the beginning of the exhibition, the department store first took out two bundles of wool yarn, one bundle was foreign goods, with bright colors and soft wool; the other bundle was the product of the Lanzhou Wool Textile Mill, with dull colors and coarse wool. The comrades of the department store asked: "What is the reason for this?" The comrades of the wool textile mill immediately replied: "Our factory's equipment is not good, the raw materials are not good, although the product color is not bright, but it is strong and durable." So the comrades of the department store gave a demonstration on the spot. When the Lanzhou wool mill's wool yarn was picked up and shaken, broken wool flew everywhere, while the foreign goods did not have this phenomenon. The comrades of the department store also explained that this bundle of good wool yarn was not from Shanghai, but from Inner Mongolia, probably the factory equipment there is not better than the Lanzhou Wool Textile Mill either. At this time, the comrades of the wool textile mill truly admitted that they had been blindly complacent in the past and expressed that they would immediately correct themselves. That night, the factory convened a meeting of technicians and old workers to study ways to improve product quality.

After thoroughly criticizing the "Industrial Backwardness Theory" and liberating their minds, the local industrial production in Lanzhou immediately presented a vigorous new look. Factories that were previously thought to have outdated equipment and backward technology are now trial-producing many advanced new products; even industrial factories with little equipment are successfully trial-producing new products that are innovative and unique. For example, the Lanzhou Automobile Repair Factory has very simple equipment, but after the workers' painstaking research and overcoming numerous difficulties, they successfully trial-produced a 24-horsepower tractor in six days. Now, a upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and improving product quality is being launched in factories throughout Lanzhou. The Foci Pharmaceutical Factory workers proposed five measures that can produce more than 300 new products, and this year the factory will strive to have 60 kinds of pills reach the national top level. The Lanzhou Glass Factory proposed that its products should be compared with Shanghai and Tianjin, and the Lanzhou Qinfeng Enamel Factory proposed that its products should catch up with Xi'an. The Northwest Wool Textile Mill proposed that jacquard blankets should be compared with Tianjin, and plaid blankets and solid-color blankets should strive for the national top level.

In the wave of each factory catching up with the advanced and improving product quality, the trade departments have also taken some measures. The Municipal Bureau of Commerce has sent a working group to department stores and civil materials companies to investigate and study the sales of local industrial products, and held joint meetings with relevant factories to sign sales contracts. Some companies, after checking the layout of the shelves, are preparing to set up special counters for local industrial products, or to place local industrial products in prominent places. Trade staff are prepared to reflect customer requirements and opinions to the factories at any time. I thought this factory could only produce some small parts. Why think? Please take a look.

    反掉“工业落后论”以后
    本报记者　张鸣
    兰州市地方工业产品有改进吗？许多人恐怕还在打着闷葫芦。为要说明这个问题，我们不妨再回顾一下兰州市“五一”节的群众大游行。那天，在工人大队里，展出了各式各样的新产品，有机器工业产品，也有手工业产品，真是五花八门，美不胜收。当甘肃农具厂试制的“五一”拖拉机、七行播种机以及兰州市汽车修配厂试制的“跃进”号拖拉机轧轧地开过主席台时，全场顿时响起了一片欢呼声。兰州市工业部门最近有个统计：今年头四个月，地方工业（包括手工业）试制成功的新产品已经达到六百多种。其中供农业生产用的有拖拉机、播种机、大型水泵、人工降雨器等等；日常用品有留声机、电话会议扩大器、连乘计算机、风琴等等。有些人总以为兰州的工业产品质量差，价钱贵，不愿买它。其实，旧皇历不该再看了。兰州过去的工业产品，一般是质量差些（但也有些较好的），但是近几个月来，产品质量却改进得飞快。兰州皮鞋厂生产的皮鞋，有些已赶上上海名牌货。西北毛纺厂生产的15号制服呢和提花毛毯，已达到国内先进水平。全市手工业生产中，已有木器、乐器和陶器用具几百种赶上了全国的水平。第一铁器生产合作社制造的刨刀，质量和外地一样，但价格却便宜的多。
    兰州地区曾经长期流行着“工业落后论”。有这种观点的人，认为兰州工业规模小，设备简陋，技术不高，很难生产新产品和质量高的产品。但是，有的时候，他们却又表现出一种盲目自满情绪，说什么“现在比过去好多了，还能改进到哪里去”。这种不可能前进和不必要前进的思想，好比两只小脚，紧紧束缚着兰州的地方工业，使它长期处在一种忸忸怩怩的状态。过去在工业部门，常听到一种管理人员唉声叹气地说：“烂滩子、烂机器、没奔头。”兰州汽车修理厂职工曾经试制成功四种活塞，经过检验，质量完全合乎标准。可是有一位工业领导人却给职工泼冷水：“你们是修理业，不是制造业，不能向外订货。”建西铁工厂的职工，有一次提出要试制电动水车，一位工业领导人却说：“你们只能试制粗的，不能试制细的”。这可把职工们气坏了，他们就自动放弃休息时间，不断试验，结果粗的细的都试制成功了。有些人对本地产品硬是抱着一种成见，不管好坏，一律不要买。有的单位印报表、饭票、刻公章也往北京、上海跑。贸易部门过去对本地货也不大感兴趣，有人赠给他们三句话：“人在兰州，眼望上海，腿在天津”。有一个时候，不管大小用品，都由外地运来。从上海运进来粉条、扫帚，从东北运来钁把。有这样一个笑话：兰州玻璃厂生产的玻璃杯，到天津旅行了一趟，又被兰州贸易部门批发回来了。有一次，一位顾客在百货公司买帽子，他问营业员：“这帽子是哪里造的？”回答说：“上海造的。”恰好这句话被制造这种帽子的手工业社员听到了，当场一追问，那位营业员便改口说：“我们是仿照上海样子造的。”
    双反运动一开始，兰州市的职工们就对“工业落后论”展开了无情的揭露和批判。4月间，举行的兰州市党代会议上，又集中批判了这种右倾保守思想。当时曾组织了一个工业品展览会，陈列的工业产品有二千多种，其中有本地产品、也有外地产品。代表们一边参观、一边开小组会讨论评比。工业部门和商业部门针锋相对，争论得非常激烈。工业部门说：我们的产品好，你们为什么不推销。商业部门说：你们的货就是赶不上外来货。但经过几天的商品大展览，商业部门和工业部门都暴露了自己的“工业落后论”思想，不得不承认过去在相互间没有很好地挂上钩。商业部门已经认识到，这次工业部门布置的五、六百种产品，有不少质品确实是好的，但是过去却不大了解。商业系统这次单独布置的三个展览室，展出一千五百多种商品，其中80％以上是选的外来的优等货，而本地货不但少，而且都是选的劣等货，这实际上是商业部门的一次思想大暴露。至于工业部门的自卑自满情绪，可以拿百货公司和兰州毛纺厂的一场争论作例子。展览会开始，百货公司首先拿出两捆毛线，一捆是外来货，色泽鲜艳，毛质柔软；另一捆是兰州毛纺厂的产品，色泽晦暗，毛质粗硬。百货公司的同志就问：“你们看这究竟是什么道理”？毛纺厂的同志立即答复说：“我们厂设备不好，原料不好，产品颜色虽然不鲜艳，但却坚固耐用。”于是百货公司的同志，就当场表演给大家看。兰毛厂的毛线拿起来一抖，碎毛纷飞，而外来货却没有这种现象。百货公司的同志还解释说：这捆好毛线不是上海货，而是内蒙古产品，大概那里的工厂设备也不会超过兰州毛纺厂吧。这时，毛纺厂的同志才真正承认过去有盲目自满情绪，表示要立即改正。当晚这个厂就召集技术人员、老工人开会，研究改进产品质量的办法。
    当彻底批判了“工业落后论”，思想解放以后，兰州的地方工业生产就马上呈现出一种生气勃勃的新气象。过去认为设备陈旧，技术落后的工厂，现在都试制出许多高级的新产品；甚至连没有什么设备的工业工厂，试制成功的新产品，也是花样翻新，无奇不有。例如，兰州汽车修理厂设备很简陋，但是经过职工们苦心钻研，克服重重困难，六天内竟试制成功一台二十四马力的拖拉机。现在兰州市各工厂，正在掀起一个学先进、赶先进提高产品质量的热潮。佛慈制药厂职工提出了五项措施，就能生产三百多种新产品，今年该厂要争取六十种丸药达到全国第一。兰州玻璃厂提出产品要和上海、天津比，兰州勤丰搪瓷厂提出产品要赶西安。西北毛纺厂提出提花毛毯比天津，格子毯、素色毯，争取全国第一。
    在各工厂赶先进、提高产品质量的浪潮中，贸易部门也采取了一些措施。市商业局已派出工作组到百货公司、民用器材公司调查研究销售地方工业产品的情况，并和有关工厂举行联席会议，订立销售合同。有的公司在检查了货架布置状况后，准备专门设立地方工业产品柜台，或把地方工业产品摆在明显的地方。贸易工作人员准备把顾客对商品的要求和意见随时反映给各工厂。我想这个厂只能生产些小零件。何必想呢？还是请你看吧。（附图片）
