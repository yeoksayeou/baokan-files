    "Children's Agricultural Cooperative"
    Recently, children in Puding County, Guizhou Province, have established 166 children's agricultural production cooperatives. In these small agricultural cooperatives, children learn production knowledge and actively participate in labor. As of mid-May, the county had a total of 2,614 young cooperative members in children's agricultural cooperatives established around elementary schools and villages. Now, during extracurricular activity time, one can see the children lining up, singing songs, and going to the fields to work. Some are weeding corn, others are fertilizing pumpkins and peppers, working as diligently as adults.
    Members of the children's agricultural cooperatives mainly participate in labor during their spare time, ensuring that both production and learning are not neglected. Each cooperative has fixed land, and some small agricultural cooperatives also raise chickens and silkworms, engaging in "sideline" production.
    The children have not only learned some production techniques and skills in managing the cooperatives, but more importantly, they have cultivated excellent qualities such as love for labor and love for the collective. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    “儿童农业社”
    贵州省普定县的孩子们最近办起了一百六十六个儿童农业生产合作社，孩子们在这些小农业社中学习生产知识并且认真参加劳动。到5月中旬止，全县以小学为中心、以村寨为单位建立的儿童农业社共有小社员二千六百十四人。现在，每逢课外活动时间，就可以看到孩子们排着队，唱着歌下地生产。他们有的给玉米锄草，有的为南瓜、辣椒施肥，干起活来像大人一样认真。
    儿童农业社的社员们主要是利用课余时间参加劳动，做到生产、学习两不误。各社都有固定土地，有的小农业社还养鸡、养蚕，搞“副业”。
    孩子们不仅学会了一些生产技术和管理社的本领，更重要的是培养了他们热爱劳动、热爱集体的优秀品质。　（据新华社讯）
