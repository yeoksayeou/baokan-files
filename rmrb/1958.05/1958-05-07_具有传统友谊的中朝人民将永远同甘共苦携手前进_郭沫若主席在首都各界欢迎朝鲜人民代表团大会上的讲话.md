Dear guests, comrades:

Today, we are holding a rally in Beijing, our capital, to welcome the Korean People's Delegation to China. First of all, on behalf of the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese people, I extend a warm welcome and sincere respect to the distinguished guests from heroic Korea.

The friendship between the Chinese and Korean people is forged with blood. We have already achieved great victories in the struggle for peace and socialist construction.

The Korean people are the closest friends of the Chinese people. In the struggle against common enemies, our two peoples have repeatedly shared weal and woe, stood together through thick and thin, and fought side by side. During the Chinese people's successive domestic revolutionary wars and the War of Resistance Against Japan, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Korean people spared no effort to sacrifice their lives to support the Chinese people. When American imperialism invaded Korea and tried to spread the flames of war to our country, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese people also formed the Chinese People's Volunteers and went to the Korean front to fight against American aggression and defend our homes and country. The brotherly friendship between our two peoples is forged with blood. Both of our countries are socialist countries guided by Marxism-Leninism, and both are members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union. Therefore, the friendship between our two peoples is even more intimate and unbreakable. We are very happy that we are marching forward shoulder to shoulder in the cause of socialist construction.

In the past few years since the war, under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and the Republic's government, the heroic Korean people have achieved brilliant achievements in the struggle for peaceful reunification and socialist construction. The Korean people have victoriously completed the Three-Year Plan for the restoration and development of the post-war national economy, and are now confidently implementing the historically significant First Five-Year Plan. After only a few years of construction, the Korean people have not only quickly healed the serious wounds of war, but also significantly exceeded the pre-war level in terms of industrial and agricultural production. The total industrial output value in 1957 reached 2.8 times the pre-war level, and grain production also exceeded the pre-war level, reaching 3.2 million tons. We Chinese people are immensely pleased with the tremendous achievements made by the Korean people.

We Chinese people are also advancing by leaps and bounds on the road of socialist construction. In 1956, we basically completed the socialist revolution on the economic front, that is, in the ownership of the means of production. In 1957, we also successfully carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. On the basis of the nationwide rectification campaign and the counterattack against the bourgeois rightists, our people are now exerting their utmost efforts, aiming high, and striving to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The situation of the nationwide Great Leap Forward is surging and has spread to all regions, industries, and departments of the country. After completing and overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan, our people are now working hard to complete and overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. We believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the initiative of the masses, and on the basis of prioritizing the development of heavy industry, implementing the policy of simultaneous development of industry and agriculture, and simultaneous development of central and local industries, we will certainly be able to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products within fifteen years or a little longer; and quickly build our country into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. However, although we have achieved certain achievements in socialist construction, we are still backward in many aspects, and we need to continue to work hard, intensify our efforts, learn from fraternal countries, and learn from all advanced experiences.

We Chinese people deeply feel honored to be able to fulfill our due obligations to our fraternal Korean people: to raise and educate war orphans into adults.

Dear comrades, in the midst of engaging in the intensive cause of peaceful construction, the friendly cooperation between China and Korea has further developed. In recent years, the leaders of our two countries have visited each other many times; the people of the two countries have also sent delegations to pay friendly visits to each other many times. This constant mutual visitation and contact has greatly strengthened the historically traditional friendship and unity between our two countries. This visit of the Korean People's Delegation to China has brought us the profound friendship of the Korean people, and we express our heartfelt thanks. As everyone knows, during the American imperialist's frantic war of aggression against Korea, many Korean children became orphans without fathers or mothers. A considerable number of such orphans have been fostered and educated in the three northeastern provinces of our country. Over the years, they have grown into adults and have received certain cultural education and technical training, and can serve the construction of their own country. We Chinese people deeply feel honored to be able to fulfill such a due obligation to our fraternal Korean people. This time, the Korean People's Delegation will also visit the three northeastern provinces to see those young next generation, and we hope that their growth can contribute to the construction of Korea.

The overall international situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. Any American aggressive conspiracy is bound to fail.

Comrades, we are now in an international environment that is very conducive to the cause of socialist construction. Since the Soviet Union's two artificial satellites went into space, and the Communist and Workers' Parties held a meeting in Moscow and issued two declarations, the peaceful construction of the countries of the socialist system headed by the Soviet Union has achieved new achievements, demonstrating the incomparably abundant vitality of the socialist system to the world. The imperialist camp is just the opposite, and the gloomy scene of economic crisis has enveloped the United States and the entire capitalist world. The overall international situation is that the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and we must constantly promote the development of this situation.

In February of this year, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea put forward a proposal to withdraw all foreign troops from North and South Korea and peacefully reunify Korea, and our government immediately issued a statement expressing its full support. Subsequently, a Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai visited Korea. A joint statement was issued with the Korean government. Further indicating the sincerity of China and Korea in easing tensions in the Far East and peacefully resolving the Korean issue. In particular, in response to the Korean government's proposal, the Chinese People's Volunteers proactively decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958. The first batch of troop withdrawal has been successfully completed. In contrast, American imperialism has not only failed to take any positive measures in terms of troop withdrawal, but has also continued to carry out various provocative activities. This shows that American imperialism is determined to obstruct the realization of the peaceful reunification of Korea and continue to create tension in the Far East. However, at present, the call for maintaining world peace is becoming louder and louder, and the proportion of peaceful forces is becoming more and more dominant, and any aggressive conspiracy of the United States is bound to suffer failure.

Although the Chinese People's Volunteers have left Korea, our hearts are forever together.

Comrades, we will never forget the support and help that the Korean people have given to the Chinese People's Volunteers over the years. Whether in times of war or in peaceful days, due to the enthusiastic support and cordial care of the Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteers, who were far away from their motherland, felt warm as if they were stationed in their hometown. This noble proletarian internationalist spirit of the Korean people is worthy of our Chinese people's good learning. Although the Chinese People's Volunteers have left Korea, our hearts are forever together. The Chinese people will forever work tirelessly with the heroic Korean people to oppose imperialist aggression and defend peace in the Far East.

Finally, we want to solemnly declare once again: The just struggle of the Korean people for the peaceful reunification of their motherland has been supported by peace-loving countries and people all over the world. We firmly believe that with the continuous efforts of the Korean people and the continuous support of peace-loving people all over the world, the three thousand li of beautiful rivers and mountains of Korea will surely be able to achieve peaceful reunification.

Long live the industrious and brave Korean people!

Long live the eternal and unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and Korean people!

Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

Long live world peace!

    具有传统友谊的中朝人民将永远同甘共苦携手前进
    郭沫若主席在首都各界欢迎朝鲜人民代表团大会上的讲话亲爱的来宾们，同志们：
    今天我们在我国首都——的北京举行欢迎朝鲜人民访华代表团的大会，我首先以中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国人民的名义，向来自英雄朝鲜的贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎，并且致以诚挚的敬意。
    中朝人民的友谊是用鲜血凝结成的。我们在争取和平和社会主义建设中已经取得了伟大的胜利。
    朝鲜人民是中国人民最亲密的朋友。在反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们两国人民曾经屡次同甘苦、共患难、一起并肩作战。在中国人民历次国内革命战争期间和抗日战争期间，朝鲜人民的优秀儿女不惜牺牲生命支援中国人民；在美帝国主义侵略朝鲜并要把战火燃烧到我国的时候，我们中国人民的优秀儿女也组成了中国人民志愿军到朝鲜前线去进行了抗美援朝保家卫国的斗争。我们两国人民兄弟般的友谊是用鲜血凝结成的。我们两国都是以马克思、列宁主义为指导思想的社会主义国家，都是以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭的成员。因此，我们两国人民的友谊更是亲密无间、牢不可破的。我们非常高兴，我们正在肩并肩地在社会主义建设事业上，大踏步地前进。
    战后几年来，英雄的朝鲜人民在朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府的领导下，在争取和平统一和建设社会主义的斗争中，已经取得了辉煌的成就。朝鲜人民已经胜利地完成了恢复和发展战后人民经济的三年计划，现在正在信心百倍地执行着有历史意义的第一个五年计划。经过短短几年的建设，朝鲜人民不仅迅速医好了严重的战争创伤，而且在工农业生产方面，显著地超过了战前水平。1957年的工业总产值，已经达到战前的二点八倍，谷物生产也超过战前水平，达到了三百二十万吨。对于朝鲜人民所获得的这样巨大的成就，我们中国人民感到无比的高兴。
    我们中国人民在社会主义建设道路上，也同样的在向前跃进。1956年我们基本上完成了经济战线上的也就是在生产资料所有制方面的社会主义革命。1957年我们又胜利地进行了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命。在全民整风运动和反击资产阶级右派的基础上，我国人民正在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。全民大跃进的形势，汹涌澎湃地，已经遍及全国各个地区、各个行业和各个部门。我国人民在完成和超额完成第一个五年计划之后，现在正在为提前和超额完成第二个五年计划而努力。我们相信，在中国共产党的领导下，依靠群众的积极性，在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行工农业并举、中央工业同地方工业并举的方针，我们一定能够在十五年或者更多一点的时间内，在钢铁和其他主要工业产品产量方面赶上或者超过英国；很快地把我国建设成为具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。但是，我们在社会主义建设中虽然取得了一定的成就，我们目前在很多方面还是落后的，我们需要不断努力，加紧苦干，向兄弟国家学习，向一切的先进经验学习。
    能够为兄弟的朝鲜人民尽一点应尽的义务：把战争孤儿抚养教育长大成人，我们中国人民深深以为光荣。
    亲爱的同志们，在从事紧张的和平建设事业中，中朝两国的友好合作，又有了进一步的发展。几年来，我们两国的国家领导人，曾经多次地互相访问；两国人民也多次地互相派出代表团进行友好访问。这种不断的互相访问和互相接触，大大加强了我们两国有历史传统的友谊和团结。这次朝鲜人民访华代表团前来访问我国，给我们带来了朝鲜人民的深厚友谊，我们表示由衷的感谢。大家知道，在美帝国主义疯狂地进行侵略朝鲜的战争中，使朝鲜的许多儿童成为了无父无母的孤儿。有不少人数的这样的孤儿在我国的东北三省接受抚养和教育，几年来，他们都已经长大成人，受到了一定的文化教育和技术训练，可以为建设自己的祖国服务了。能够为兄弟的朝鲜人民尽到了这样一点应尽的义务，我们中国人民深深以为光荣。朝鲜人民代表团这次来访问，也要到东北三省去看望那些年轻的后一代，我们希望他们的成长能够对朝鲜的建设事业作出贡献。
    整个的国际形势是东风压倒西风。美国的任何侵略阴谋是必然会失败的。
    同志们，我们现在正处在一个非常有利于社会主义建设事业的国际环境中。自从苏联的两个人造卫星上天、共产党和工人党在莫斯科举行会议和发表了两个宣言以来，以苏联为首的社会主义体系各国的和平建设都取得了新的成就，向全世界显示出社会主义制度无比充沛的生命力。帝国主义阵营却恰恰相反，经济危机的阴暗景象已经笼罩着美国和整个资本主义世界。整个的国际形势是东风压倒西风，我们要不断地促进这样的形势发展。
    今年2月间，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府提出了从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的建议，我国政府立即发表声明表示全力支持。接着以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团访问了朝鲜。同朝鲜政府发表了联合声明。进一步表明了中朝两国对和缓远东紧张局势和和平解决朝鲜问题的诚意。特别是为了响应朝鲜政府的建议，中国人民志愿军主动决定在1958年年底以前分批地全部撤出朝鲜。第一批撤军工作，已经顺利结束。和这相反，美帝国主义在撤军方面不仅没有采取任何积极的措施，反而还在不断地进行各种挑衅活动。这就说明，美帝国主义一心想阻挠朝鲜和平统一的实现、继续制造远东的紧张局势。但是，在目前维护世界和平的呼声正越来越响亮，和平力量的比重正越来越占优势，美国的任何侵略阴谋是必然会遭受失败的。
    中国人民志愿军虽然离开朝鲜，但是我们的心是永远在一起的。
    同志们，几年来朝鲜人民给予中国人民志愿军的支援和帮助，我们是难以忘记的。不论在战争时期，或者和平日子里，由于朝鲜人民的热烈支援和亲切关怀，使远离祖国的中国人民志愿军像驻在自己家乡一样，感到温暖。朝鲜人民这种高尚的无产阶级国际主义精神，值得我们中国人民很好地学习。中国人民志愿军虽然离开朝鲜，但是我们的心是永远在一起的。中国人民将永远同英雄的朝鲜人民一道，为反对帝国主义的侵略和保卫远东的和平而作不懈的努力。
    最后我们要再一次郑重声明：朝鲜人民争取自己祖国和平统一的正义斗争，是得到了全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的支持的。我们坚决相信：经过朝鲜人民的不断努力和全世界爱好和平人民的不断支持，朝鲜的三千里锦绣河山，是一定能够实现和平统一的。
    勤劳勇敢的朝鲜人民万岁！
    中朝两国人民永恒的牢不可破的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
