    Give Full Play to the Role of People in Production and Construction
    Taiyuan Launches a Mass Movement to Learn Multiple Technologies
    Editor's Note: The movement to learn multiple technologies by everyone, carried out by industrial and construction enterprises in Taiyuan, is a very good experience. It has many benefits for solving the problem of labor shortage in the Great Leap Forward, improving production efficiency, raising the technical level of workers, and implementing the construction policy of more, faster, better, and more economical results. We suggest that other regions and other enterprises also try to promote this experience.

    (People's Daily, Taiyuan, May 22) A mass movement for everyone to become a jack-of-all-trades—learning multiple technologies—is being launched in depth in the industrial and construction enterprise systems of Taiyuan. The development of this movement has broken the limitations of over-detailed division of labor and only understanding one technology in production and construction, allowing people to give full play to their roles in production and construction and better adapt to the needs of the Great Leap Forward situation.
    The learning of multiple skills was initiated in March of this year by the civil engineering team led by Shen Xikai, who is in charge of the expansion project of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant. This team previously had the following contradiction: on the one hand, the construction task was very heavy and required a large increase in labor; on the other hand, due to the restrictions of excessively emphasizing professional division of labor, a large number of workers were idle. This year, they launched a movement for everyone to learn multiple skills. Bricklayers also learned plastering, painting, and concrete mixing; carpenters who install doors and windows also learned to lay floors. In this way, not only was the phenomenon of uneven workloads and idleness between work types fundamentally eliminated, and the utilization rate of working hours increased by about 50%, but also the plan to recruit more than 1,000 technical workers this year was canceled. This team's approach quickly attracted attention from all sides, and the construction enterprise system, factories and mines, and offices all believed it could be learned from. As a result, the upsurge of learning multiple skills immediately expanded from the construction system to the industrial production system, down into the mines, and into factory and mine offices. Taiyuan Municipal Construction Engineering Company, Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory, Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant, and many factory and mine offices have all formulated overall plans and measures for learning multiple skills. So far, more than 20,000 people in the city have learned two to three technologies or businesses.
    The development of this movement has brought about a series of changes in production, construction, and other aspects of work. In the past, because one person only understood one technology, no matter how big or small the task, how much the workload, or how the situation changed, they always stuck to one position and could not mutually adjust manpower between work types, resulting in an uncoordinated situation where there was both idleness and waste on one side and manpower shortage on the other. After learning multiple skills, one person mastered multiple skills, completely overcoming the phenomenon of idleness. Various construction engineering teams, which were idle for half a year and working for half a year in the past, have basically achieved no idleness this year. In the coal mine system, electromechanical workers and production team leaders who did not participate in production in the past also participated in production after learning multiple skills. This practice of one person having multiple skills and doing multiple jobs has also directly promoted collaboration and cooperation between various work types, between processes, and between this job and that job. Taiyuan Municipal Engineering Company, Xing'an Chemical Materials Factory, Taiyuan Electric Heating Plant, and more than ten units such as Shanxi Xishan Coal Mine have implemented major mergers of work types after workers learned multiple skills. Taiyuan First Construction Engineering Company merged twenty-six work types into six work types. Due to the merger of separate and complex work types, an engineering team became a whole. Some engineering teams can contract to do three or four processes, and some can contract to do five or six processes. These teams do not need any allocation or command. After completing the previous process, they do the next process, greatly improving the efficiency of working hours. Xie Shukun, an accountant in the office, and Wang Dechun, a material handler, learned three business jobs from each other. They often cooperate with each other, with you going out and me replacing you, and me going to the workshop and you helping me. People describe it as: "In the past, strengthening collaboration from the labor organization and manpower allocation was like yam eggs in a burlap bag. On the outside, it looks like a whole, but in reality, they are still individual. Now, the collaboration of multiple skill workers is like paint and glue, which cannot be pulled apart."
    Many workers have learned more systematic technical principles as a result of learning multiple skills and have begun to combine intelligence and physical strength in their labor. In the past, Taiyuan electric heating workers who operated No. 1 machine could not operate No. 2 machine; those who operated the distribution panel did not know the factory's electricity usage; and many steam turbine drivers did not even know what auxiliary equipment their units had, and they did not dare to make changes even if they felt there were unreasonable aspects in the operation. After learning multiple skills, many people can operate six or seven types of equipment. They not only understand the structure of the machines but also master the performance of the machines. If they find something unreasonable, they improve it themselves.
    The development of the multiple skills movement has greater significance in the construction enterprise system. In addition to solving the serious problem of idleness, it also solves the frequent transfer problem unique to construction enterprises. For example, Taiyuan Fourth Engineering Company, which first learned multiple skills, had an average of 60% of its people being transferred every day from 1953 to 1957. When this engineering company was building a factory in the Fularji area, due to the limitations of the specialized teams of one person per skill, on the one hand, they transferred people from Lanzhou, Wuhan, and other places thousands of miles away to provide support; on the other hand, they went to other places to construct. This year, when they built the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant's primary rolling mill, they contracted the work themselves because the workers had all learned multiple skills. The workers wrote a limerick for this: "In the past, when building a factory, we sought aid five times, centralized three times, and transferred troops from thousands of miles away; now, when building a factory, we rely on our own efforts, solve the problem locally, and do not transfer a single soldier."

    充分发挥人在生产建设中的作用
    太原开展学会多种技术运动
    编者按：太原市工业企业和建筑企业开展的人人学会多种技术的运动，是一个很好的经验。它对于解决大跃进中劳动力不足的问题，对于提高生产效率，提高工人的技术水平，贯彻执行多快好省的建设方针，有很多好处。我们建议其他地区、其他企业也来试行推广这个经验。
    本报太原22日电　一个人人学会多面手——多种技术的运动，正在太原市工业企业和建筑企业系统深入展开。这一运动的开展，打破了生产建设中分工过细、一人只懂一种技术的局限，使人在生产建设中充分发挥作用，更能适应生产大跃进形势的需要。
    学习多面手是担负太原钢铁厂扩建工程建设的沈锡凯领导的土建工程队在今年3月倡议的。这个队过去存在着这样的矛盾：一方面是建设任务十分繁重，需要增加大量劳动力；另一方面却由于强调专业化分工过细的限制，工人大量窝工。今年他们开展人人学会多面手运动，瓦工们也学会了抹灰、粉刷、搅拌混凝土；上门窗的木工也学会了铺楼板。这样，不仅从根本上消灭工种之间的忙闲不均窝工现象，工时利用率也提高了50％左右，还取消了今年要招收一千多名技术工人的计划。这个队的做法很快引起了各方面的重视，建筑企业系统、厂矿、科室等各个方面都认为可以学习。于是，学习多面手的热潮立即由建筑系统扩展到工业生产系统、矿井下和厂矿科室。太原市政建设工程公司、兴安化学材料厂、太原电热厂和许多厂矿科室，都订出了学习多面手全面规划和措施。到目前为止，全市一人学会两种到三种技术或业务的已有两万多人。
    这一运动的开展，给生产、建设等方面的工作带来了一系列的变化。过去因为一人只懂一种技术，所以，不管任务大小，工作量多少以及情况发生了变化，总是固守一职，不能在工种之间相互调剂人力，造成一面窝工浪费，一面人力不足的不协调局面。学习多面手以后，一人掌握了多种技能，彻底克服了窝工现象。一向半年工作半年闲的各个建筑工程队伍，今年来已基本上做到了不窝工。在煤矿系统，过去不参加生产的机电工人、生产队长，学习多面手后，也参加了生产。这种一人多技、干多种活的做法，还直接促进了各个工种之间、工序之间，以及这一工作和那一工作之间的协作配合。太原市政工程公司、兴安化学材料厂、太原电热厂和山西西山煤矿等十多个单位，在工人学会多面手后，实行了工种大合并。太原第一建筑工程公司把二十六个工种合并为六个工种。由于把分隔而复杂的工种合并，一个工程队就成了一个整体，有的工程队一个队能包做三、四道工序，有的能包做五六道工序。这些队不要任何调配和指挥，做完上道工序就做下一道工序，大大提高了工时利用效率。科室的会计员谢淑坤、材料员王德淳互相学会了三种业务工作，他们经常实行你外出我代替，我下车间你帮助的协作。人们形容说：“过去从劳动组织上和人力调配上加强协作，好比麻袋装山药蛋，外表上看是整体，实际上还是一个一个的；现在多面手的协作，如漆似胶，拉也拉不开。”
    很多工人由于学习多面手而懂得了比较系统的技术原理，开始把智力和体力结合进行劳动。太原电热工人，过去开一号机的就不能开二号机；操作配电盘的不知道厂用电情况；许多汽机司机连本机组有那些附属设备也不清楚，感到操作上有不合理的地方也不敢改动。学习多面手以后，很多人可以操纵六、七种设备。他们既了解了机器的构造，也掌握了机器的性能，发现那里不合理就自行改进。
    多面手运动的开展，在建筑企业系统意义更大，除解决了严重的窝工问题外，还解决了建筑企业特有的调动频繁问题。如最先学习多面手的太原第四工程公司，从1953年到1957年，平均每天有60％的人在调动。这个工程公司在建设富拉尔基地区的一个工厂时，由于一人一技的专业队的限制，一方面千里迢迢地从兰州、武汉等地调人支援，一方面他们又到别处去施工。今年他们建设太原钢铁厂初轧厂，由于工人都学会了多面手，就自己包干了。工人们为此编了打油诗：“过去干工厂，五次求援，三次集中，千里调兵；现在干工厂，自力更生，就地解决，不调一兵一卒。”
