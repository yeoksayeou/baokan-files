Thoughts on Seeing "Going West"
　　Wen Shan
　　After watching the "Going West" performed by the Hohhot Folk Song and Dance Troupe of Inner Mongolia, I was astonished by its profound ideological content and delicate artistry.

　　Such a small play, with only two people, vividly reflects the bloody history of the local working people through a cross-section of life. At the same time, it so realistically depicts the most tender and ardent love of working women, making people feel both resentment and pity. This simple and profound artistic style is indeed the crystallization of the hard work of the working people themselves, and it is worthy of our special cherishment.

　　"Going West" has profound social and historical significance. Like the Shaoxing opera "Female Ghost," it is an accusation against the dark and inhuman old society. In the North China region, who doesn't know what "Going to the Northeast" and "Going West" were all about! In the past, in those barren years when "not even a blade of grass grew, and people starved to death," "the rich had granaries full of food, while the suffering people were truly pitiful." How many husbands left their wives and children to go West! The people of Inner Mongolia will never forget this period of history. This play seizes this profound theme and portrays the love between a newly married couple, and the young wife's reluctance to part, so deeply and vividly. The plot is arranged so intricately and delicately, demonstrating the utmost skill. It is truly rare. We should learn well this ability to profoundly depict the inner activities of characters.

　　When Sun Yulian first heard her husband say he was going West, she simply didn't believe it, thinking Da Chun was teasing her. When she realized it was true, she couldn't help but cry bitterly. The play repeatedly features Sun Yulian crying and asking her husband, "Are you really leaving? Can't I keep you?" These words are heartbreaking. The lyrics are also good: "Brother goes West, sister can't keep him, unstoppable tears of sorrow, flowing down one after another. Married in the first month, you leave for the West in the second; if I had known you were going West, I would rather not have married!" It makes you feel how cruel that society was. And the development of the plot is one step tighter than the other: the wife packs a small bag for her husband, but she keeps holding onto it and doesn't want to let go. Finally, she gives it to him, and after the husband leaves, she cries and calls him back, saying, "If brother must go, sister won't force you to stay. Let me comb your hair, so you'll look like a man with a wife when you're out there!" To comb his hair, to be together for even a little while, is good! In the tenderness and care, you feel the tears of countless people, and also the tears of the author; this is truly the most authentic emotion of the working people themselves. Even after he has left, she still repeatedly and bitterly urges: "Walk on the main road, don't walk on the small road. There are many people on the main road, who can ease your worries. Rest on flat ground, don't lean against the cliff, for fear the cliff will collapse and crush you." How sincere and delicate the script is written!

　　The actors also perform well. Leaving aside other things, let's just talk about one small action—when Da Chun has already left the house, Sun Yulian faces away from the audience, still crying, thinking her husband is still behind her. So, she subconsciously reaches out to pull him, but touches emptiness, and suddenly realizes that her husband has left. She turns around and cries out loudly... This one action fully demonstrates that Sun Yulian is already heartbroken and distraught. The actors and directors are both skilled. From what I understand, most of the actors are young and haven't been studying for long, but they study diligently and make rapid progress. They will bring new life to the Errentai. However, during this performance in Beijing, I seem to feel that Sun Yulian's performance was not as good as when I saw it in Hohhot last year. This time it seems like she is using too much force (for example, the crying is too loud, and the emotional development reaches its climax too quickly, etc.), and she lacks composure and restraint. Therefore, it actually detracts from the tragic atmosphere. This is probably something the actor did not anticipate.

　　"Errentai" also has many other valuable plays, such as "Borrowing a Hat" and "Playing on a Swing," which each have their own merits. But these plays could also be more refined. "Picking Cherries" is said to be very good, but unfortunately, I haven't seen it. I think this drama form is still in its infancy. If it continues to absorb nourishment from the lives of the people and other drama forms, to enrich itself, its future is very promising.

　　I think there must be many good plays that have not yet been discovered, or have not received the attention they deserve. We must continue to work hard to explore, study, and inherit traditions. Inheriting traditions is for creating art that is even better than the tradition. I feel that when some drama forms perform plays that reflect real life, they have not yet been able to make good use of the good things in traditional art. It seems like they are taking shortcuts. Of course, this is not easy, but in this regard, we must also use the spirit of the Great Leap Forward to break through conventions and create vigorously.

    看“走西口”有感
    闻山
    看了内蒙古呼和浩特市民间歌舞团的“走西口”，它那深刻的思想内容和细腻的艺术使我感到惊愕。
    这么一个小小的戏，两个人，却把当地劳动人民血泪斑斑的历史，通过生活的一个侧面，集中地反映了出来；同时如此逼真地描画了劳动妇女最温柔最热烈的爱情，使人愤恨又使人怜惜。这种纯朴、浑厚的艺术风格，的确只能是劳动人民自己心血的结晶，值得我们分外珍视。
    “走西口”有着深刻的社会意义和历史意义。他和绍兴戏“女吊”一样，都是对惨无天日的旧社会的控诉。华北地区的农民，谁不知道“闯关东”、“走西口”是怎么回事！在过去那“寸草也不长，活活饿死人”的荒年，“有钱的粮满仓，受苦人真可怜”，多少丈夫离妻别子，走了西口！这一段历史，内蒙古人民是忘不了的。这出戏就抓住了这个深广的主题，而且把一对新婚夫妻的恩爱，和年轻的妻子那种难割难舍的心情，刻划得那么深切生动，戏剧情节安排得那么曲折委婉，极尽细腻之能事，实在是难得。这种深刻地描写人物内心活动的本领，我们应该好好学习。
    孙玉莲刚听丈夫说要走西口，她根本就不相信，以为大春在逗她玩；到弄清这是真的，便忍不住痛哭起来。剧中一再出现孙玉莲哭着问丈夫“你真的要走了？留也留不住了？”这样的话，听着叫人心酸。唱词也是好的：“哥哥走西口，妹妹也难留，止不住伤心泪，一道一道往下流。正月娶过门，二月你西口外行；早知道你走西口，那如不成亲！”它使你感受到那个社会是多么残忍。而剧情的发展，也是一步逼紧一步：妻子为丈夫收拾了个小包袱，但又一直拿在手里不肯放，最后给了，丈夫出了门，她又哭着喊丈夫回来，说“哥哥一定要走，妹妹也不强留，我给哥哥梳梳头，你到外面也像个有老婆的人！”梳个头，多在一块那怕是一会儿，也是好的呵！在温柔体贴之中，你感到有无数人的眼泪，也有作者的眼泪；这真是劳动人民自己的最真实的感情。已经出门了，还要一再苦苦地叮咛：“走路走大路，你不要走小路，大路上人儿多，能给哥哥解忧愁。歇歇平地歇，你不要靠崖头，恐怕崖头倒，压你在崖里头。”剧本写得多真挚，多细腻！
    演员也是演得好的。别的不说，光谈一个小动作——当大春已经走出了家门，孙玉莲背向观众，还在哭，以为丈夫仍在身后，于是她下意识地伸过手来拉他，摸空了，才猛然发现丈夫已走，回过头便大声哭喊起来……这一个动作，充分地表现了孙玉莲已经伤心得丧魂失魄，演员和导演都是有功夫的。据我了解，演员中绝大部分是青年，学艺不久，但他们认真钻研，进步快，他们将给二人台带来新的生命。不过这次来京演出，我似乎觉得孙玉莲演得没有我去年在呼和浩特看的好，这次好像是用力太过（例如哭声太响，情绪发展到高潮过快等等），沉着含蓄不足，因此反而有损悲剧性的气氛，这恐怕是演员所未料想到的。
      “二人台”还有不少有价值的剧目，如“借冠子”、“打秋千”等，都各有妙处，但这些剧目，也还可以更精练些，“打樱桃”据说也很好，可惜我未看过。我想，这个剧种现在还在它的童年，如果继续从人民生活和其他剧种中多多吸取营养，丰富自己，前途是大有希望的。
    我想，我们一定还有许多好的剧目未被挖掘出来，或者还未得到应有的重视，我们一定还要再努力探求、研究、继承传统，继承传统是为了创造比传统更好的艺术。我感到目前有些剧种演反映现实生活的戏时，还未能很好地运用传统艺术中好的东西，似乎有点贪轻便。当然，这是不容易的，但在这方面，我们也要用跃进的精神去突破成规，大力创造。
