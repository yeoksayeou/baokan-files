Title: Good Methods

The large-scale development of local industry and the commissioning of new factories and mines raise the question: where will the labor force come from? Different places have different ingenious solutions to this problem. Some small county and township factories cooperate with agricultural cooperatives, with members working as workers during the agricultural off-season and returning to farming during the busy season. Some factories with seasonal production cooperate with each other, helping me when I'm busy and me helping you when you're idle. Some places adopt the method of "laying hen," where all the people needed by the new factory are taken care of by the old factory. Today, this newspaper also introduces the experience of Yangquan, Shanxi. They solve this problem from the scope of a city, and there are even more methods—a total of twelve were devised. Many of these are universal and can be learned by various places. For example, organizing mutual allocation and cooperation between enterprises; using adjustments to labor organization, advocating that one person learn multiple skills, promoting technological reforms, and using machines to replace manual labor to transfer people from old factories and mines; and so on. Some were devised based on the specific circumstances of Yangquan, such as implementing old replacing young and female replacing male, replacing young adults doing odd jobs, and so on. These methods for solving the labor force problem are all good methods.

However, the "goodness" of these methods does not lie in the specific practices. Because specific practices that are indeed good in this time and place may not be good in that time and place, and sometimes they may not even work at all. The goodness of these methods lies in "adapting to the time and place" and not sticking to old routines. This is also a matter of using materialist dialectics to do work. Chairman Mao said in "On Practice":

"The genuine revolutionary leader ... when a certain objective process has already shifted and transformed from one stage of development to another, must be good at making himself and all personnel participating in the revolution also shift and transform in subjective understanding, that is, to make the proposal of new revolutionary tasks and new work plans suitable for the changes in the new situation." Expanding industrial construction, recruiting workers from rural areas, and requesting people from other places are already the "old calendar" of the early First Five-Year Plan. At that time, the industrial sector, especially the inland and newly opened industrial areas, had a weak original foundation, and relying on rural areas and outside support was necessary. However, even then, this was not the only method, and solving the problem locally was still an important complementary method. And today, large-scale construction is underway everywhere, east, west, north, and south, coastal and inland, urban and rural, and people are needed everywhere. At the same time, after several years of development, industrial sectors and cities themselves have great potential for labor. Under this new situation, if some cities still only look to the countryside and look to other places, the result is likely to be "this road is blocked."

    好办法
    王朴
    地方工业大发展，新厂矿一批一批地投入生产，劳动力从哪里来？解决这个问题，各人巧妙不同。有些县乡小工厂同农业社合作，社员农闲时来当工人，农忙时回去种地。有些季节性生产的厂互相协作，我忙的时候你来帮我，我闲的时候去帮你。有的地方采取
  “母鸡下蛋”的办法，新厂需要的人全部由老厂包下来。今天本报又介绍了山西阳泉的经验。他们从一个城市的范围来解决这个问题，办法就更多——一共想出了十二条。这里有许多是有普遍性的，各地都可以学。例如，组织企业之间互相调配协作；用调整劳动组织、提倡一人学会多种技术、推行技术改革，以机械代人工，从老厂矿里调人出来；等等。有些是根据阳泉的具体情况想出来的，如实行老换少、女换男，把做勤杂工的青壮年替换出来等等。这些解决劳动力问题的办法，都是好办法。
    然而，这些办法之“好”，倒不在于具体的做法。因为具体的做法，在此时此地确实很好，在彼时彼地就未必好，有时甚至根本行不通。这些办法之好，是好在“因时因地制宜”，不老一套。这也是一个运用唯物辩证法来做工作的问题。毛主席在“实践论”中说：
  “真正的革命的指导者，……当某一客观过程已经从某一发展阶段向另一发展阶段推移转变的时候，须得善于使自己和参加革命的一切人员在主观认识上也跟着推移转变，即是要使新的革命任务和新的工作方案的提出，适合于新的情况的变化。”扩大工业建设，从农村招工，从外地要人，这已是第一个五年计划初期的“老皇历”了。那时候，工业部门，尤其是内地和新开辟的工业区，原有基础薄弱，依靠农村和外地支援，是必要的。然而，即使在那时候，这也并不是唯一的方法，就地解决也还是一个重要的相辅而行的方法。而今天，东南西北、沿海内地、城市乡村，到处都在大规模建设，到处都需要人；同时，经过几年来的发展，工业部门内部、城市内部，都蕴藏着很大的劳动潜力。在这个新形势下，如果有些城市仍旧只把眼睛望着农村，望着外地，结果很可能是“此路不通”。
