Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The difficulty of labor shortages during the summer hoeing season can be solved through the widespread promotion of mass-created and improved mid-tillage farm tools. The mid-tillage farm tools exhibited in the cultivation machinery hall of the National Agricultural Exhibition are all created or improved by farmers in recent years. Their common advantages are that they can improve the efficiency and quality of summer hoeing and have diverse uses. The "Five Improvement Weeding Hoe" and "Four-Use Weeding Hoe" from Henan and Hebei provinces can weed, cultivate, loosen soil, and also fertilize, spray medicine, and irrigate, with efficiency dozens of times higher than manual labor. The mid-tillage and soil cultivation machine in Changge County, Henan Province, can weed and cultivate 30 mu of land per day, equivalent to the work of fifteen people per day. The weeding hoe from Yexian County, Shandong Province, can also use iron claw rollers to dig out and throw away grass roots while weeding. One person with one animal can hoe more than 12 mu of land a day. The exhibited improved hand hoes have also greatly improved efficiency. There are multi-head hoes that increase efficiency several times compared to old hand hoes, lightweight and dexterous hollow hoes, and some have even been developed into hand-pushed weeding machines.

Also on display are summer hoeing farm tools adapted to various soil characteristics. After rain, the soil surface hardens and seedlings cannot emerge. The soil breaker created by farmers in Fenyang County, Shanxi Province, can be used to break the hard crust and promote rapid seedling emergence by simply pushing it through the field. In areas prone to drought during the summer hoeing season, the wooden multi-row water and fertilizer applicator from Anhui Province or the fertilizer and drought-resistant cart from Shanxi Province can be used. Three people can irrigate and fertilize 30 to 40 mu of land per day, equivalent to the workload of forty people.

In the past, farmers could only use small hand hoes and manual thinning. Now, tools can also be used to replace them. The thinning and weeding machine created by the Yingkou County Farm Tool Factory in Liaoning Province, exhibited here, has received high praise from many visitors. This farm tool is suitable for thinning and weeding corn, sorghum, and cotton. It can thin two rows at a time, with a spacing of 21 centimeters. One person with one animal can thin and weed 45 mu of land a day.

　　中耕效率大可提高
    农展会展出大批新式中耕农具
    据新华社14日讯　历年来夏锄期间劳动力不足的困难，将通过大量推广群众创造、改良的中耕农具，获得解决。全国农具展览会耕作机具馆里展出的中耕农具，都是最近几年农民创造或改良的，它们的共同优点是能够提高夏锄工作效率和质量，用途多样。河南、河北省的五改耘锄、四用耘锄，可以锄草、培土、松土，又能追肥、撒药、浇水，效率比用手工进行提高几十倍。河南省长葛县的中耕培土器，每天能锄草和培土三十亩地，相当于十五个人一天的工作量。山东掖县的锄草耘锄，在锄草时还能用铁爪滚子把草根刨出抛远，一个人一头牲畜，一天就可以锄地十二亩以上。展出的改良手锄，效率也提高很多，有比旧手锄提高效率几倍的多头锄，有轻便、灵巧的空心锄，有的还发展成手推锄草器。
    展出的还有适应各种土质特点的夏锄农具。雨后地表硬结小苗出不了土，就可以用山西汾阳县农民创造的碎土器，只要在田里推着走一遍，就能划破硬皮，促使小苗很快出土。夏锄期间发生干旱的地区，可以用安徽省的木制多行追水肥器，或者用山西省的追肥抗旱车，三个人一天能浇水肥三十亩到四十亩，相当于四十个人的工作量。
    过去农民只能用小手锄和手间苗，现在也能用工具来代替。这里展出的辽宁省营口县农具厂创造的间苗锄草机，得到许多观众的好评。这种农具适用于玉米、高粱、棉花的间苗除草，每次可间两行，间距二十一公分，一个人一个畜力一天可以间苗、锄草四十五亩地。
