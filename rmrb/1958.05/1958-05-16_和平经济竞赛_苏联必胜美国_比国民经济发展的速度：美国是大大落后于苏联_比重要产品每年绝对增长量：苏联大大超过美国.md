Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 15th: According to Soviet newspapers, the Soviet Union not only greatly surpasses the United States in the development speed of the national economy, but also, in recent years, has greatly surpassed the United States in the annual absolute increase of many important products.

From 1929 to 1957 (excluding war years), the Soviet Union's industrial output increased by an average of more than 16% per year, while the United States' industrial growth averaged less than 3% per year. In the first quarter of this year, Soviet industrial production flourished, with output increasing by 11% compared to the same period last year, while the economic crisis in the United States continued to deepen, with industrial production decreasing by 11% compared to the first quarter of last year.

From 1953 to 1957, the Soviet Union greatly surpassed the United States in terms of development speed and annual absolute increase in coal, iron ore, steel, oil, pig iron, cement, and woolen fabrics.

During this period, the Soviet Union's average annual absolute increase in coal was 30.6 million tons, while the United States' was 5.7 million tons. Last year, the Soviet Union's coal production increased by more than 33 million tons, while the United States decreased by 14.44 million tons. In 1955, the Soviet Union's coal production was 80% of the United States', and last year it rose to 97%. According to this situation, the Soviet Union's coal production will exceed the United States for the first time this year. In 1913, the United States' coal production was about eighteen times that of Russia.

The Soviet Union's iron ore production in the period from 1953 to 1957 averaged an annual absolute increase of 6.1 million tons, while the United States averaged an annual decrease of 3 million tons; the Soviet Union's oil and cement increased annually by an average of 11.4 million tons and 3.2 million tons respectively, while the United States' two products only increased annually by an average of 8.8 million tons and 1.2 million tons. In terms of steel and pig iron, the Soviet Union increased by 3.2 million tons and 2.4 million tons annually, while the United States only increased by 300,000 tons and 800,000 tons. The Soviet Union's woolen fabrics increased by an average of 18.4 million meters per year, while the United States decreased by 9.8 million meters per year.

In terms of agricultural product output, the Soviet Union has already exceeded or approached the level of the United States in many agricultural products. Currently, the Soviet Union's annual wheat production is more than double that of the United States, sugar beets are about twice as much, wool is one and a half times as much, and the output of animal fats has also exceeded the level of the United States, while milk is also approaching the level of the United States. Before the October Revolution, the United States' cotton production was about fourteen times that of Russia. Last year, the Soviet Union's cotton production almost reached two-thirds of the United States' total cotton production, while the yield per unit area in the Soviet Union greatly exceeded that of the United States.

　　和平经济竞赛　苏联必胜美国
    比国民经济发展的速度：美国是大大落后于苏联
    比重要产品每年绝对增长量：苏联大大超过美国
    新华社莫斯科15日电　据苏联报刊报道，苏联不仅在国民经济的发展速度方面大大超过美国，而且最近几年来在许多重要产品的每年绝对增长量方面也大大超过美国。
    从1929年到1957年（战争年代除外），苏联工业产量每年平均增长16％以上，而美国工业的增长每年平均不到3％。今年第一季度，苏联工业生产蓬勃发展，产量比去年同期增加了11％，而美国的经济危机不断加深，工业生产比去年第一季度减少了11％。
    从1953年到1957年，苏联在煤、铁矿砂、钢、石油、生铁、水泥、毛织品的发展速度和每年绝对增长量方面都大大超过美国。
    在这个期间，苏联煤每年的平均绝对增长量是三千零六十万吨，而美国是五百七十万吨。去年，苏联煤产量增加了三千三百多万吨，美国却减少了一千四百四十万吨。1955年，苏联煤产量为美国的80％，去年就上升到97％。今年第一季度，苏联煤产量比去年同期增加了9％，而美国却减少了21％。根据这种情况看来，苏联煤产量今年将第一次超过美国。而在1913年，美国煤产量约相当于俄国的十八倍。
    苏联铁矿砂产量在1953年到1957年期间平均每年绝对增长量是六百一十万吨，而美国每年平均减少了三百万吨；苏联石油和水泥每年平均分别增加一千一百四十万吨和三百二十万吨，而美国这两种产品每年平均只增加八百八十万吨和一百二十万吨。在钢和生铁方面，苏联每年增加三百二十万吨和二百四十万吨，而美国只增加三十万吨和八十万吨。苏联毛织品每年平均增加一千八百四十万公尺，而美国每年却减少九百八十万公尺。
    在农产品产量方面，苏联已经有许多农产品超过了或接近美国的水平。现在，苏联每年小麦产量比美国多一倍以上，甜菜约多两倍，羊毛多一倍半，动物油脂的产量也已超过了美国的水平，牛奶也接近美国的水平。十月革命前，美国棉花产量约相当于俄国的十四倍，苏联去年棉花产量差不多达到了美国棉花总产量的三分之二，而单位面积产量，苏联则大大超过美国。
