Culture is the Treasure of Farmers
Over Nine Million Young and Middle-Aged Illiterate People in Anhui Province Have All Enrolled in School
800,000 Newly Literate Farmers Open the Door to Learning Technology

    (Our Dispatch) Reporter Qin Yuzhen reports: After 800,000 farmers in Anhui Province graduated from literacy classes, they actively participated in studying agricultural production techniques and learning and disseminating advanced agricultural production experiences, which greatly promoted the reform of agricultural production techniques.
    These farmers, who have both production experience and are literate and cultured, not only serve as work-point recorders, statisticians, and accountants in the cooperatives but also actively organize agricultural technology research groups, production reform shock brigades, and other organizations, making great achievements on the agricultural production front. Jiang Weikun, the production team leader of the Shunhe Agricultural Cooperative in Funan County, actively studied popular agricultural knowledge books after graduating from literacy class. He learned the techniques of sweet potato close planting, sweet potato seedling cultivation, and seed selection. The sweet potatoes he cultivated created a record of 10,000 jin per mu. The Dawangzhuang Production Team of the Tiantang Cooperative in Funan County had seven or eight members who graduated from literacy class. They organized a technical reform shock brigade and learned rice cultivation techniques, converting four mu to rice cultivation, with an average yield of 1,220 jin per mu, breaking the local farmers' saying that "leaky soil" cannot be converted to rice fields, setting an example for dry land conversion to paddy fields in the county. In the Huangkou Town Agricultural Cooperative in Xiao County, seven members who graduated from literacy class formed an agricultural technology research group. Under the guidance of the technology extension station, they carried out a three-crop-a-year system of sweet potatoes, potatoes, and kohlrabi, with a yield of over 9,700 jin per mu, equivalent to 970 jin of grain. Now, this group is experimenting with a four-crop-a-year system of wheat, corn, pumpkin, and sweet potato. Literacy graduates of the Jiangjiahua Agricultural Cooperative in Lai'an County have also established a production technology research group, learning and promoting the techniques of soaking and selecting seeds with muddy water, salt water, and baking soda, which has greatly helped the agricultural cooperative increase production. After 77 people graduated from literacy classes at the Houyingzi People's School in Lu'an County, they could use seeders after reading the instructions. The cooperative members said, "Culture is a treasure for farmers; with culture, one can become skillful."
    Many farmers who have graduated from literacy classes are still continuing their studies. Some have entered higher primary school classes, and some have entered private agricultural middle schools to continue their studies.
    Also, the current 9,370,000 young and middle-aged illiterate people in rural Anhui Province have all enrolled in school. Although it is currently the busy season for spring production, Anhui has adopted various methods to closely integrate learning with production, thus resolving the contradiction between production and learning culture. Students not only study at night but also bring textbooks, literacy cards, and small blackboards to water conservancy construction sites and fields during the day, using rest time to study. In terms of learning methods, the combination of classroom learning, object-based literacy, and one-on-one teaching is adopted. The learning organization is also adapted to the production organization, with production teams serving as learning groups. In terms of teaching content, words related to daily life and farm work are taught first, teaching cooperative members to record work points and accounts, so that they can be applied while learning, which greatly improves farmers' enthusiasm for learning, and therefore the learning progress is very fast.

    文化是庄稼人的宝
    安徽省九百多万青壮年文盲已全部入学
    八十万扫盲毕业农民打开学习技术大门
    本报讯　记者秦聿震报道：安徽省八十万农民扫盲毕业后，积极参加研究农业生产技术，学习和传播农业生产先进经验，对推动农业生产技术的改革起了很大作用。
    这些有生产经验又识了字学了文化的农民，不但在社里担任记工员、统计员、会计，而且积极组织农业技术研究小组、生产改革突击队等组织，在农业生产战线上作出很大成绩。阜南县顺河农业社生产队长姜维坤，扫盲毕业后，积极学习通俗的农业知识书，他学会了红芋密植、红芋苗的培养和选种的技术，他栽培的红芋，创造了每亩产一万斤的纪录。阜南县田堂社大王庄生产队，有七、八个扫盲毕业的社员，组织了技术改革突击队，学习了水稻栽培技术，改种了四亩水稻，每亩平均产量达一千二百二十斤，打破了当地农民说“漏风土”不能改种水稻的说法，给这个县旱地改水田树立了榜样。萧县黄口镇农业社，有七个扫盲毕业的社员，组成了一个农业技术研究小组，在技术推广站的指导下，进行了红芋、马铃薯、大头菜三级复种，亩产达九千七百多斤，折合粮食九百七十斤。现在，这个小组正在试验复种小麦、玉米、南瓜、甘薯四熟作物。来安县姜家湖农业社的扫盲毕业生们，也成立了生产技术研究小组，学习和推广了用泥水、盐水、小苏打浸种和选种的技术，对这个农业社提高产量起了很大作用。六安县后郢子民校有七十七人扫盲毕业后看过说明书，就会使用播种机。社员们说：“文化是庄稼宝，有了文化就能生巧”。
    扫盲毕业后的农民们，很多人仍在继续学习，有些人进了高小班，有些人进入了民办农业中学，继续深造。
    又讯　目前安徽全省农村九百三十七万多青壮年文盲已全部入学。现在虽然处在春季大生产的繁忙季节，安徽由于采取了各种各样的办法，使学习紧密结合生产，因此解决了生产和学习文化的矛盾。学员们不但晚上学习，而且白天带着课本、识字牌、小黑板到水利工地和田间，利用休息时间学习。在学习方法上，把班级学习、见物识字和包教包学三者结合起来。学习组织也和生产组织相适应，生产小队就是学习小组。在教学内容上，先教日常生活和农活有关的字，教社员记工分账，这样一面学习一面就可以应用，大大提高了农民的学习情绪，因此学习进度很快。
