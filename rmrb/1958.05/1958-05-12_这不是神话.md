　　This Is Not A Myth

　　The news of the successful trial production of a "semiconductor generator" by the jointly owned public-private Chaoyang Electric Motor Factory has spread rapidly like wildfire among many related units across the country. In the past half month, over a hundred congratulatory letters have been sent from many cities and rural areas nationwide.

　　How could this small factory, which had absolutely no equipment or materials for trial-producing "semiconductor generators," manufacture such a technically complex generator in just forty days? It sounds almost like a myth. However, after visiting the factory, one believes it to be true.

　　Before the Spring Festival this year, three technicians and one worker from the factory saw a drawing of a "semiconductor generator" at a science and technology exhibition in the Soviet Union. It was shaped like a large tripod with a kerosene lamp suspended underneath. When the lamp was lit, it could both provide lighting and power a five-tube radio. This could play a significant role in establishing broadcasting networks in rural areas without electricity. After these four people returned from the exhibition, they often gathered together to study this complex product. Their ideas were brought to the attention of the factory's administrative and Party branch leaders. At a joint meeting of the Party, administration, labor union, and Youth League, it was decided to transfer these four people to specialize in trial-producing this product. The leaders' active support further boosted their confidence.

　　The biggest difficulty in trial-producing the "semiconductor generator" was that these people lacked knowledge of semiconductors and related technical information. They bought many reference books and read them day and night, but still didn't know where to start. Once, they visited the leaders in charge of semiconductor manufacturing. After hearing their description of the factory's lack of chemical analysis equipment and machinery for semiconductor trial production, and that they had only produced electrical switches in the past, the leader shook his head repeatedly and advised them not to take the risk, otherwise they would lose everything. This well-intentioned advice shook the confidence of these four people. Other engineers in the factory also laughed at them for "daydreaming." At this time, the factory's leading cadres encouraged them while also going with them to the Institute of Applied Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Electrical Science Research Institute for guidance. The staff of these two units enthusiastically told them about the methods of combining semiconductor elements. The Electrical Science Research Institute also told them about the problems they had encountered in their own trial production of "semiconductor generators." After returning to the factory, they immediately designed two plans for experimentation.

　　The second difficulty they faced was the lack of chemical analysis equipment and tools, and they overcame these difficulties with ingenuity. They needed a ball mill to crush zinc and antimony metals, so they used tools for crushing Chinese medicine instead. They needed a press to press the powder metallurgy into test blocks, so they went to the Beijing Insulating Materials Factory to borrow one. When the workers heard that it was a generator being trial-produced for the rural areas, they came to help operate the machine during their rest time. The first zinc-antimony alloy test block was pressed out. They held the test block over a kerosene lamp to heat it and measured it with an ammeter at the same time. The needle on the ammeter moved slowly, proving that there was electricity in the test block. Everyone cheered excitedly. A test block is a power generation unit, and the news that the first semiconductor power generation unit had electricity spread throughout the factory. The next day, all the workers in the factory wrote them a congratulatory letter, wishing them success in advance.

　　A "semiconductor generator" requires three thousand four hundred power generation units. These power generation units must be rapidly pressed at high temperature and high pressure. The method they initially adopted was that the temperature was not high, and it took four hours to press one unit, the efficiency was as slow as a snail. After painstaking research, the technicians increased the temperature of the mold, and they could press four power generation units in one hour. They were preparing to mass-produce them, but because the power generation units were too thin, they were inevitably broken even when pressed carefully, and the pressing speed was hindered again. Worker Yang Xuewen came up with the idea of changing the fixed mold into a live mold, which reduced the breakage rate and made the trial production work go smoothly.

　　On the night of March 31, after a whole night, and after seven un- and re-installations, they finally assembled the three thousand four hundred power generation units they pressed into a semiconductor generator. The generator drove the radio, and the people who had worked all night laughed at their success.

　　这不是神话
    公私合营朝阳电机厂试制“半导体发电器”成功的消息，像长着翅膀一样迅速地在全国许多有关单位里传播着。半个多月来，全国许多城市和农村已经寄来了一百多封祝贺信。
    这个根本没有试制“半导体发电器”设备和资料的小工厂，在四十天内如何制成这种技术复杂的发电器？这简直有点像神话。但是，访问了这个工厂以后，才相信这是事实。
    今年春节以前，这个工厂三个技术人员和一个工人在科学技术展览会上，看到苏联一张“半导体发电器”图样。它的形状像一个大型的三角架，下面悬着一盏煤油灯，把灯点亮以后，既能照明，又能带动一台五灯收音机广播。它对没有电源的农村建立广播网能起很大作用。这四个人参观回来以后，就常常聚在一起研究这种复杂的产品。他们的想法，被厂里行政和党支部的领导人知道了，在一次党、政、工、团的联席会议上，决定把这四个人调出来专门试制这种产品。领导上积极支持，更加使他们充满信心。
    试制“半导体发电器”最大的困难，是这些人缺乏半导体的知识和有关半导体的技术资料。他们买了许多参考书，废寝忘食地阅读，还是不知道从何着手。有一次，他们去访问负责制造半导体工作的领导人。这位领导人听了他们关于这个工厂没有试制半导体的化验设备和机器设备，过去只会生产电器开关的叙述后，连连摇头，劝说他们别冒险，否则会赔掉老本。这种好意的劝说，使这四个人的信心发生了动摇。厂里的其他工程师也笑他们在“白天做梦”。这时，工厂的领导干部一面鼓励他们，一面和他们一起到中国科学院应用物理研究所和电器科学研究院去请教。这两个单位的工作人员热情地告诉他们半导体元素的配合方法。电器科学研究院还把自己试制“半导体发电器”存在的问题告诉他们。他们回到厂里，就立即设计了两个方案进行试验。
    面临的第二个困难是没有化验设备和工具，他们用穷办法克服了这些困难。粉碎锌和锑两种金属需要球磨机，他们就用捣碎中药的工具来代替。把粉末冶金压成试块需要压力机，他们到北京市绝缘材料厂去借用。工人们听说是为农村试制的发电器，在休息时间也赶来帮助开动机器。第一块锌、锑合金的试块压制出来了。他们拿着这块试块放在煤油灯上加热，同时用电表测量，电表上的针头在缓缓移动，证明试块里有电，大家兴奋得欢呼起来。一个试块是一块发电单元，第一块半导体发电单元里有电的消息，传遍了全工厂。第二天，全厂工人就写了一封祝贺信给他们，预祝他们成功。
  一台“半导体发电器”上，需要三千四百块发电单元。这种发电单元必须在高温高压下才能迅速压成。他们最初采用的方法，温度不高，四个钟头才压成一块，效率像蜗牛爬一样。技术人员们经过苦心钻研，提高了模子的温度，一个小时能压成四块发电单元。他们正准备大量压制时，由于发电单元太薄，小心翼翼地压制还难免折断，压制速度又受到阻碍。工人杨学文想出把死模改成活模，减少了折断率，使试制工作顺利地进行起来。
    在3月31日晚上，经过整整一个通宵，一连卸装七次，他们终于把压制出来的三千四百块发电单元装配成了一台半导体发电器。发电器带动着收音机响了，彻夜工作的人们为自己的成功欢笑起来。
