Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 1st: The furnace bottom utilization coefficient of the No. 7 open hearth furnace at Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 1 Steel Plant reached 11.94 in April, surpassing the national record of 10.64 created by the Youth Solidarity Furnace in February.

The larger the furnace bottom utilization coefficient of an open hearth furnace, the greater the steel output. It is an important economic and technical indicator in the steel industry. According to relevant calculations, if the furnace bottom utilization coefficient of all open hearth furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel could reach the level of the No. 7 open hearth furnace, more than 1.5 million tons of steel could be produced annually, which is equivalent to building a large steel plant for the country without spending a penny of the state's money.

The main method used by the No. 7 open hearth furnace this month to greatly increase the furnace bottom utilization coefficient was to implement a major reform to expand the charging capacity of the open hearth furnace. In the past, this open hearth furnace could only charge 180 tons of material according to the original design; later, after improvements, it was increased to 225 tons. There was still a certain gap in the furnace, but people were worried that charging too much would affect the quality and the life of the furnace body, and it had been maintained at the level of 225 tons. Now, after taking necessary technical measures, the charging capacity has been expanded from 225 tons to 300 tons, and the original three ladles of steel per furnace have been increased to four. Since this measure was implemented on April 1, the steel output per furnace has increased by a quarter. While implementing this major measure, the steelworkers also tried to shorten the smelting time, thereby increasing the furnace bottom utilization coefficient of this open hearth furnace from 7.34 in March to 11.94. The total monthly steel production exceeded the national plan by more than 3,000 tons, and the quality of the steel also met the standards.

The practice of this major reform over the past month has proven that it is an effective way to increase steel production. Due to the adoption of some technical measures, the quality of the steel has not been affected, and the smelting time has not been prolonged; on the contrary, it has been shortened by more than 20 minutes compared with March.

### 鞍钢七号平炉一项重大改革  每炉钢产量增加四分之一

    鞍钢七号平炉一项重大改革
    每炉钢产量增加四分之一
    据新华社鞍山1日电　鞍钢第一炼钢厂七号平炉4月份炉底利用系数达到了十一点九四，超过了青年团结炉2月份创造的十点六四的全国纪录。
    平炉炉底利用系数越大，出钢量越多，它是炼钢工业重要的经济技术指标之一。据有关方面计算，如果鞍钢全部平炉炉底利用系数都能达到七号平炉的水平，一年就可以增产一百五十多万吨钢，等于不用国家一文钱为国家增建一个大型炼钢厂。
    七号平炉这个月份大大提高炉底利用系数的主要办法，是实现了一项扩大平炉装入量的重大改革。过去这个平炉按原设计只能装料一百八十吨；以后经过改进增加到二百二十五吨。炉膛里还有一定空隙，但是人们担心再多装会影响质量和炉体寿命，而一直保持在二百二十五吨的水平。现在经过采取必要的技术措施，把装入量从二百二十五吨扩大为三百吨，并且由原来每炉出三罐钢增加为出四罐。这项措施从4月1日实行以来，每炉钢产量增加了四分之一。在实行这项重大措施的同时，炼钢工人还设法缩短了熔炼时间，从而使这个平炉炉底利用系数由3月份的七点三四提高到十一点九四，全月比国家计划超产钢三千多吨，钢的质量也合乎标准。
    这项重大改革经过一个月的实践证明，它是增加钢产量的一项有效办法。由于采取了一些技术措施，钢的质量并没有受到影响，熔炼时间也没有延长；相反地，还比3月份缩短了二十多分钟。
