    Using No Firebricks to Build Furnaces and No Coke to Smelt Iron:
    Yangcheng's Native Blast Furnaces Require Little Investment but Produce a Lot of Iron
    Taiyuan, May 5th (this newspaper) – The Yingchao Handicraft Iron Production Cooperative in Yangcheng County, Shanxi Province, has created a (native blast furnace) iron smelting method that requires little investment but yields high output. The entire equipment investment is only 400 yuan, with a daily production of 1.5 tons of pig iron and an annual output of 500 tons. This is a good example for developing county-run iron smelting industries and building small-scale iron smelting plants.
    Handicraft industry is very developed in Yangcheng County, and small-scale iron smelting and ironware manufacturing have a history of hundreds of years. But in the past, iron smelting used very old "square furnaces," which had low output, high costs, and high labor intensity. In order to adapt to the demands for industrial products brought about by the great leap forward in agriculture, and in response to the call of the Party Central Committee to catch up with Britain in the output of major products such as steel in about fifteen years, the workers and cadres of the Yingchao Iron Works pooled their ideas and, combining the shape of a blast furnace with the internal structure of a local iron-melting furnace, designed a "native blast furnace" themselves. This furnace is five meters high. The construction of the native blast furnace makes full use of local resources and does not require reinforced concrete or firebricks. The furnace body is made of blue bricks and porcelain cylinder bricks. It does not use electricity as power; it only requires a small five-horsepower locomobile engine to drive the blower to send air into the furnace. The blower is also made by the local handicraft cooperative. In order to solve the fuel problem, while experimenting with the "native blast furnace," they also successfully created a method of using anthracite coal to smelt iron, which is a major technological reform in iron smelting technology, providing experience for the development of iron smelting industries in vast areas without coke resources.
    Yangcheng County recently summarized this experience and plans to promote the construction of 150 new "native blast furnaces" throughout the county this year. After completion, it can produce 60,000 tons of pig iron annually, basically meeting the needs of the county's development of industrial and agricultural production and construction.
    Currently, more than 300 technicians and workers from ten provinces, including Sichuan, Henan, and Liaoning, have been sent to the Yingchao Iron Works to learn the advanced experience of the "native blast furnace" on-site.

### 不用耐火砖筑炉不用焦炭炼铁  阳城土高炉投资少出铁多

    不用耐火砖筑炉不用焦炭炼铁
    阳城土高炉投资少出铁多
    本报太原5日电　山西省阳城县应朝手工铁业生产合作社创造了一种投资少、产量高的（土高炉）炼铁方法。全部设备只投资四百元，每日生产生铁一吨半，年产五百吨，对于发展县营炼铁工业，建设小型炼铁厂是很好的榜样。
    阳城县手工业很发达，小型炼铁和制造铁货有数百年历史。但过去炼铁是采用很古老的“方炉”，产量低，成本高，劳动强度大。为了适应农业大跃进对工业产品的要求，以及响应党中央提出的十五年左右在钢铁等主要产品产量方面赶上英国的号召，应朝铁业社的工人和干部一起想办法，结合高炉的外形和本县一种化铁炉的内部结构，自己设计了一种“土高炉”。这种炉高五公尺，建设土高炉全部利用当地资源，不用钢筋水泥和耐火砖。炉体是用青砖和磁缸砖砌成。不用电作动力，只要一部五马力的小型锅驼机带动鼓风机向炉内送风，鼓风机也是当地的手工业社制作的。为了解决燃料问题，在试验“土高炉”的同时，还创造成功了用无烟煤炼铁，它是炼铁技术上一个重大的技术改革，为广大的没有焦炭资源的地区发展炼铁工业提供了经验。
    阳城县最近总结了这个经验，计划今年全县要推广新建一百五十座“土高炉”，建成后，可年产生铁六万吨，基本上满足本县发展工农业生产建设的需要。
    目前，已有四川、河南、辽宁等十个省派来了三百多名技术人员和工人到应朝铁业社进行现场学习“土高炉”的先进经验。
