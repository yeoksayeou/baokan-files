Comrades, Fellow Compatriots, Guests:

Today, we, the people of the capital, are holding a celebration parade to celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day, a day for the solidarity and struggle of working people around the world.

Participating in our conference are labor models and advanced workers from the economic front, the cultural front, and other fronts, as well as representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, representatives of ethnic minorities from all over the country, and representatives of returned overseas Chinese. We extend our warm congratulations and welcome to them.

Participating in our conference are diplomatic envoys stationed in our country, as well as guests from many countries. We extend our warm welcome and heartfelt gratitude to them.

In the past year, under the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of our country have carried out the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, achieving a great victory in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. We have launched a nationwide movement for ideological emancipation and a great leap forward, setting off a high tide of a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and other aspects of socialist construction. Now, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our people are mobilizing all positive factors to vigorously carry out the Second Five-Year Plan, go all out, aim high, and develop our socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. We will continue to develop our industry and agriculture simultaneously on the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry. Under the unified leadership, overall planning, and division of labor and cooperation of the Central Committee, our central state-owned industries and local industries, our large-scale industries and small and medium-sized industries are all making a great leap forward at the same time. On the basis of continuing to complete the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts, our vast numbers of cadres and masses are giving full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity and are beginning to carry out a great technical revolution and cultural revolution, striving to realize the Forty Articles of the National Agricultural Development Program ahead of schedule, striving to catch up with or surpass Britain in the output of steel and other major industrial products in fifteen years or a little longer, and striving to build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science in the fastest possible time. We extend our warm congratulations and heartfelt gratitude to the comrades and friends who are actively producing, working hard, and studying hard on the industrial, agricultural, and other fronts.

Today is also the solemn day for the completion and unveiling of the Monument to the People's Heroes in the capital. We pay high revolutionary tribute to the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves in the People's Liberation War and the People's Revolutionary War, and we pay high revolutionary tribute to the people's heroes who sacrificed themselves in the struggles since 1840 for the sake of opposing internal and external enemies and striving for national independence and the people's freedom and happiness. The People's Heroes are immortal!

Now, the celebration parade begins. We invite the leading comrades of the Central Committee to review the ranks of the masses of people in the capital.
