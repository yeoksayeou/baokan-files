Following the Spirit of the General Line, Rectifying Communes: Rectification Movement in Guangdong's Rural Areas Becomes a Driving Force for Production

    (Our dispatch) The rural rectification and commune consolidation movement in Guangdong Province between spring and summer has been fully launched. Cooperatives in various areas have already or are launching a high tide of "big blooming and big contending" (大鸣大放) in the form of big-character posters (大字报), and an unprecedentedly high socialist democratic political situation is gradually taking shape.

    The general practice in the first step of this rural rectification and commune consolidation movement is: vigorously publicize the General Line for Socialist Construction, use the spirit of the General Line to examine and summarize current production and cooperative work, and unfold "big blooming and big contending" around current production and cooperative work; and simultaneously, while speaking out and debating, rectify problems, linking the rectification and commune consolidation movement with current production, so that the rectification and commune consolidation movement becomes a driving force for current production. Some big-character posters focus on the four characters of "more, faster, better, and more economical" (多、快、好、省) in the socialist construction line, with emphasis on the "better" and "more economical" aspects. Farmers see the issue of "better" and "more economical" as a matter of the relationship between the commune member and the commune. Those who can correctly handle this relationship will certainly be able to achieve "better" and "more economical" in their work for the commune, while those who handle this relationship incorrectly will inevitably be "bad" and "wasteful" in their work for the commune. Farmers usually have the most opinions in this regard, and they have all been raised this time. These opinions generally fall into the following categories: first, what attitude to take towards labor for the commune? What attitude to take when leading production for the commune? Second, what attitude to take towards feeding the commune's cattle? Raising the commune's fishponds? Managing the commune's public farm tools? Third, how to correctly handle the relationship between the commune's production and household sideline production? A small number of opinions concern cadre work style, cadre-masses relations, and relationships between commune members; these are all major issues of production relations. Most farmers, especially those Party members and poor and lower-middle peasants who are active elements, express a communist style with a very serious attitude when raising these issues in big-character posters. What to praise, what to criticize, all are based on building socialism in a "more, faster, better, and more economical" manner, and on the collective interests of the commune, with clear love and hatred, and without ambiguity.

    Various forms of "big blooming and big contending" have been adopted in the rural rectification and commune consolidation movements in various places, with big-character posters becoming the best form for promoting democracy. Many cooperatives have taken the lead by having cadres "ignite the fire on themselves" (引火烧身), posting big-character posters and organizing rural youth students, primary school teachers, and literate commune members to write big-character posters and read big-character posters for illiterate commune members, so that men, women, old and young, all have the opportunity to freely express their opinions. In places where the high tide of speaking out and debating has initially been launched, each commune has posted thousands of big-character posters, with some communes averaging more than ten posters per commune member. Big-character posters not only contain criticisms from the masses towards commune and team leaders, but also mutual criticisms between cadres, and between the masses, thus forming a mass situation of the masses supervising cadres and advanced commune members supervising backward commune members, simultaneously speaking out and debating, and rectifying.

    In many cooperatives in Sihui County, during the period of speaking out and debating, the masses inserted big-character posters into Category III rice fields, into other various backward production sites, and posted them at the doors of cadres and commune members who were not leading production well or not doing a good job in production. The masses urgently demanded a change in the backward situation. Those who did not change were continuously criticized in big-character posters; those who had already made changes were also welcomed in big-character posters. As a result, the cadre-masses relations in these cooperatives were immediately improved, the commune's management and administration had preliminary improvements, and what was particularly significant was that it greatly promoted current production. Yuda Commune in Jieyang County was originally a Category III commune with more shortcomings on the part of its cadres, and the masses drew cartoons of all three of the director and deputy directors and posted them. They were all so ashamed when they saw them that their faces turned red, and they immediately examined their shortcomings and earnestly corrected them with practical actions the next day. This was followed by a high tide of speaking out and debating and rectification throughout the commune, and this Category III commune quickly rose up. Some cooperatives also combined big-character posters with holding exhibitions against waste and against conservatism. The exhibits were all accompanied by big-character posters, with both bad and good examples; some were from cadres to the masses, and some were from the masses to cadres or from the masses to the masses. The content was lively and persuasive.

### 按照总路线精神整社  广东农村整风运动成为推动生产的动力

    按照总路线精神整社
    广东农村整风运动成为推动生产的动力
    本报讯　广东省春夏之间的农村整风整社运动已经全面铺开，各地的合作社已经或正在掀起以大字报为主要形式的大鸣大放高潮，一种空前高涨的社会主义民主的政治形势正逐步形成。
    这一次农村整风整社运动第一步工作普遍的做法是：大张旗鼓宣传社会主义建设总路线，以总路线的精神检查、总结当前的生产和合作社工作，围绕着当前的生产和合作社工作展开大鸣大放；并且边鸣放边整改，把整风整社运动和当前的生产扭在一起，使整风整社运动成为推动当前生产的动力。有的大字报集中在社会主义建设路线中的多、快、好、省四个字上，其中又着重在好和省两个字上。“好”和“省”的问题，农民看成是社员与社的关系问题。能正确处理这个关系的人，对待社的工作就一定能做到“好”和“省”，错误地处理这个关系的人，对待社的工作，就一定是“坏”和“费”。农民这方面的意见平时就是最多的，这次都提出来了。这些意见大体上有这几类，一是用什么态度对待社的劳动？用什么态度领导社的生产？二是用什么态度喂社的牛？养社的鱼塘？管理社的公共农具？三是怎样正确处理社的生产和家庭副业生产的关系？少数意见是关于干部作风、干群关系和社员之间关系，这全是些生产关系的大问题。大多数农民，尤其那些党员和贫农、下中农的积极分子，在大字报上提出这些问题的时候，态度很严肃，表现了共产主义的风格。表扬什么，批评什么，全以多、快、好、省地建设社会主义为准，以社的集体利益为准，爱憎分明，毫不含糊。
    各地农村整风整社中采用了多种多样形式进行大鸣大放，其中大字报成为发扬民主的最好形式。很多合作社都通过干部引火烧身，带头贴出大字报，并组织农村青年学生、小学教师和识字的社员去替不识字的社员写大字报、读大字报，使男女老少都有机会畅所欲言地发表意见。在初步掀起鸣放高潮的地方，每个社都贴出了一千到几千张大字报，有的社每个社员平均贴出了十张以上。大字报不仅有群众批评社、队领导的，而且有干部和干部、群众和群众之间的互相批评，因而形成了群众监督干部、先进社员监督落后社员的群众性的边鸣放边整改的局面。
    四会县许多合作社在鸣放期间，群众把大字报插到三类禾田里，插到其他各种生产落后的现场上，贴到领导生产不好或生产搞不好的干部和社员门口。群众迫切要求改变落后现象。不改变的，继续写大字报批评；已有改变的，也写大字报表示欢迎。这样一来，这些合作社的干群关系马上得到改善，社里的经营管理有了初步的改进，特别显著的是大大推动了当前的生产。揭阳县玉大社原是个三类社，干部的缺点较多，正、副主任三人都被群众画了漫画贴出来。他们见了都羞得面红耳赤，立即检查缺点，第二天就用实际行动认真地改正。接着就掀起全社的鸣放和整改高潮，这个三类社也就很快地上升了。一些合作社还结合大字报举办反浪费、反保守展览会，展览会展出的实物都配上大字报，有坏典型，也有好典型；有干部对群众的，也有群众对干部或群众对群众的，内容生动活泼，具有很大的说服力。
