The forest area is singing
    The staff and workers of the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range Forestry System are launching a singing movement. Their requirement is: study diligently and practice hard, everyone should be able to sing, learn a song every month, and let the songs of victory resound throughout the Greater Khingan Range.
    In the past few days, after work or before work, the party committee, trade union and Communist Youth League organs of the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range Forestry System have been filled with singing everywhere. The cadres of various organs have already learned the two songs "Socialism is Good" and "Catch Up with Britain".
    The Propaganda Department of the Inner Mongolia Greater Khingan Range Forestry System Party Committee has distributed 18,000 song sheets containing ten songs to the staff and workers of the forestry system, and issued a notice on April 12 about launching a singing movement among all forestry staff and workers.

　　林区在歌唱
    内蒙古大兴安岭林业系统的职工正在开展歌咏运动。他们的要求是：勤学苦练，人人会唱歌，每月学一歌，让胜利的歌声响遍大兴安岭。
    最近几天，内蒙古大兴安岭林业系统的党委、工会和共青团机关下班以后或上班以前，到处是一片歌声。各机关的干部已学会了“社会主义好”“赶上英国”两只歌。
    内蒙古大兴安岭林业系统党委宣传部已经发给林业系统职工一万八千份载有十只歌子的歌片，并在4月12日就发出了关于在全体林业职工中开展歌咏运动的通知。
