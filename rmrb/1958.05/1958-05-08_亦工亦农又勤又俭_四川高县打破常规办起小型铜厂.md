Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th—Gao County, Sichuan Province, has built a copper factory like this: without regular factory buildings or employee dormitories, only a mud-built blast furnace and a straw shed for storing fuel were constructed. It has no full-time cadres managing welfare and has only bought some common medicines such as iodine and mercurochrome since its opening. Most of the factory's one hundred and several dozen workers go to work at the factory during the day and return to their homes to rest after work; only a small number of employees live in farmers' homes.

It turns out that the Gao County Copper Factory is a small factory that was built and put into production in the first quarter of this year. This factory had very little capital, costing only 251 yuan to build, and the factory site is located in the countryside. Factory leaders and cadres broke with convention in running the factory and adopted the method of signing a tripartite contract between the factory, the agricultural cooperative, and the members to solve the worker problem, adapting to local conditions. The contract stipulates that the factory should not blindly recruit workers from the countryside, and the required labor force should be uniformly transferred through the agricultural cooperative. When the factory does not have work, the workers will return to the cooperative to engage in agricultural production; when the agricultural cooperative needs to transfer back or replace labor, it will consult with the factory in advance to resolve the matter. The contract also stipulates that a portion of the wage income of the members participating in factory production should be turned over to the agricultural cooperative as the agricultural cooperative's income, and then the agricultural cooperative will evaluate work points for this member and distribute food rations after the autumn harvest; members organized by the agricultural cooperative who only do temporary transportation work for the factory for one or two hours will have all their income belong to them personally. Currently, of the factory's one hundred and several dozen workers, in addition to a few fixed workers with smelting skills, workers for mining, crushing ore, and transportation are generally temporary workers.

Adopting the method of hiring contract workers benefits the factory, the agricultural cooperative, and the members. In addition to conducting political and ideological education for the workers, the factory does not have to manage other labor protection and welfare issues, so it does not need many management cadres, and production costs are very low. Many farmers have learned industrial production knowledge and are satisfied with being able to do both farming and industrial work.

Now, the factory's employees eat and live with the farmers; when the farmers go to work, they also go to work, and when the farmers finish work, they also finish work. They usually respect the local customs and habits of the farmers and are as close as family to the farmers.

In the two months since the start of work, the employees have not only not made excessive demands on their living and welfare, but on the contrary, everyone has taken the initiative to help the factory overcome many difficulties. They go up the mountains to cut trees to make wooden beds; in order to make it convenient to bathe and wash their faces, they build stoves next to the blast furnace to boil water themselves.

### 亦工亦农又勤又俭  四川高县打破常规办起小型铜厂

    亦工亦农又勤又俭
    四川高县打破常规办起小型铜厂
    新华社重庆7日电　四川省高县新建了这样一个铜厂：没有正规的厂房和职工宿舍，总共只修了一座土高炉和堆放燃料的草棚。它没有专职干部管理福利，开办以来只买过一些碘酒、红药水等普通药品。全厂一百几十名工人多数是白天到厂上工，放工就回到自己家里休息；只有小部分职工住在农民家里。
    原来高县铜厂是在今年第一季度兴建投入生产的小型工厂。这个厂资金很少，办厂只花了二百五十一元，厂址又座落在农村。厂里领导和干部打破常规办工厂，因地制宜地采取了工厂、农业社、社员订立三边合同的办法解决工人问题。合同规定：工厂不向农村盲目招雇工人，需要的劳动力统一通过农业社调来。工厂没有工作的时候，工人便回社搞农业生产；农业社需要调回或调换劳动力的时候，预先同工厂协商解决。合同还规定，参加工厂生产的社员的工资收入，要抽出一部分交给农业社，作为农业社收益，再由农业社给这个社员评定工分，秋收后分给口粮；农业社组织来的、只给工厂做一两小时临时运输工作的社员，其收入全部归个人。现在全厂一百几十名工人，除了具有冶炼技术的几名固定工人以外，采矿、捶矿石、运输等工人一般都是临时工。
    采取雇合同工的办法，工厂、农业社和社员三方面都有利。厂里除了向工人进行政治思想教育以外，其他劳保福利等问题就不必由厂里管了，因此不需要很多管理干部，生产成本很低。许多农民学会了工业生产知识以后，会农又会工，也感到很满意。
    现在这个厂的职工跟农民同吃、同住；农民出工，他们也出工，农民收工，他们也收工。他们平时很尊重当地农民的风俗习惯，跟农民亲如家人。
    职工们在开工两个多月来，不但没有在生活福利上提过过高的要求，相反地，大家却主动帮助工厂克服了不少困难。他们上山砍树做木床；为了洗澡、洗脸方便，就自己动手在高炉旁建灶烧水。
