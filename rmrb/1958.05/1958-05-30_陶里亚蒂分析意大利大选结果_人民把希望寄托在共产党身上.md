Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 28th: According to TASS, Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti stated in "l'Unità" that the results of the Italian elections on May 25-26 demonstrate, first and foremost, the great victory of the Italian Communist Party.

	Togliatti pointed out that all political parties in Italy, especially in recent years, have been attacking the Communist Party. Business owners and government agencies have pursued arbitrary and discriminatory policies against the Communist Party. The Communist Party has been the object of ideological intimidation and insidious attacks by church authorities, and even comrades of the Socialist Party have sometimes participated in these attacks verbally and in action. However, in this election for both houses of parliament, the Communist Party received more votes than in any previous election, maintained a high proportion of votes, and increased its seats in parliament. This once again shows that the Communist Party is the main force leading the opposition against the conservative and reactionary system of the Christian Democrats.

	Togliatti said that this election also once again shows that the Italian Communist Party is a national force and a people's force most deeply rooted in the working class, peasant masses, and middle class residents. The people place their hopes and ideals on the Communist Party. The absurd clamor about the crisis of the Communist Party has completely failed, and the despicable conspiracies of various traitors and reactionary running dogs have also gone bankrupt.

	The party's unity, its fighting spirit, and its singleness of purpose have withstood the test of the people's vote and have been further consolidated.

	Togliatti continued, just as dark clouds are gathering over the entire capitalist Europe, starting with France, the victory of the Italian Communist Party in the election guarantees that Italy has a large and advanced political organization that vigilantly defends democracy and parliamentary freedom, and defends peace.

	Togliatti said that we are also happy about the victory of the Socialist Party.

	Togliatti denounced the Christian Democrats for obtaining votes through illegal and shameful intimidation of voters. He said that this once again proves to the citizens how hypocritical and distorted the democracy spoken of by the ruling class is. At the same time, the ruling class is planning to establish a one-party government or a clerical coalition government. He said that this constitutes a real danger. To prevent this real danger, all democratic and anti-fascist forces, especially the working-class parties, must effectively take united action.

	Togliatti concluded by saying that the Italian Communist Party will fight in parliament and at home to realize its election program, and is ready to reach agreements with all those who are willing to fight to defend democracy, freedom, and peace, and strictly abide by the Constitution of the Republic.

    陶里亚蒂分析意大利大选结果
    人民把希望寄托在共产党身上
    据新华社29日讯　据塔斯社罗马28日讯：意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂在“团结报”上发表声明说，5月25—26日的意大利选举的结果说明，首先是意大利共产党获得了巨大的胜利。
    陶里亚蒂指出，意大利国内一切政党，特别是最近几年都在进攻共产党。企业主和政府机构对共产党奉行了专断和歧视的政策。共产党成了教会当局进行思想恫吓和阴险攻击的对象，连社会党的同志有时也在口头上和行动上参与了这种攻击。然而共产党在这次参众两院的选举中却得到了比历届选举更多的选票，保持了得票的高度比例，在议会中增加了席位，这再一次显示，共产党是领导反对天主教民主党的保守和反动制度的反对派的主力。
    陶里亚蒂说，这次选举也再一次表明，意大利共产党是在工人阶级、农民群众、中间居民阶层中扎根最深的民族力量和人民力量。人民把希望和理想寄托在共产党身上。所谓共产党危机的荒谬叫嚣已经彻底完蛋，形形色色的叛徒、反动派走狗的卑鄙阴谋也已经破产。
    党的团结、它的战斗精神，它的一心一德经受住了人民投票的考验，并且更加巩固了。
    陶里亚蒂继续说，正当整个资本主义欧洲的上空、从法国开始密布乌云的时候，意大利共产党在选举中的胜利保证了意大利有一个庞大的先进的政治组织，这个组织警惕地保卫着民主和议会自由，保卫着和平。
    陶里亚蒂说，我们对社会党的胜利也感到高兴。
    陶里亚蒂斥责天主教民主党通过对选民进行非法的和可耻的恐吓等办法获得了选票。他说，这再一次向公民们证明了统治阶级所说的民主是多么虚伪和多么歪曲。同时，统治阶级正打算建立一党政府或者教权联合政府。他说，这就构成一个现实的危险。要防止这种现实危险，所有的民主和反法西斯力量，首先是工人阶级政党就必须有效地采取团结的行动。
    陶里亚蒂最后说，意大利共产党将在议会中和国内为实现它的竞选纲领而奋斗，并且准备同所有愿意为保卫民主、自由和和平而进行斗争，并严格遵守共和国宪法的人取得协议。
