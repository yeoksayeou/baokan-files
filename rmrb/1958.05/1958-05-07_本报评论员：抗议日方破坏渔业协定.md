    Protest Against Japan's Destruction of the Fisheries Agreement

    In recent months, incidents of Japanese fishing vessels violating the China-Japan Fisheries Agreement, damaging our fishing boats, and dragging away our fishing gear, causing serious harm to the production and safety of our coastal fishermen, have become increasingly frequent. According to preliminary information, from March 15 to May 1 this year, Japanese fishing vessels intruded into the trawler fishing prohibited areas, causing as many as thirteen destructive incidents, resulting in tens of thousands of yuan in losses to our fishermen. Some Japanese fishing vessels altered their vessel numbers and broke into the prohibited areas, and some even attempted to rob our fishing boats. On May 1, the Japanese "Yu Ming No. 155" collided with and damaged one of our fishing boats in Poshan Ocean, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang Province, causing the fisherman Xu Shunlai to fall into the water and drown. Regarding the illegal actions of these Japanese fishing vessels, the China Fisheries Association has lodged a solemn protest with the Japan-China Fisheries Council on May 6, demanding that the Japanese side prevent similar incidents from happening again by Japanese fishing vessels, and demanding compensation for all losses suffered by our fishermen.

    As everyone knows, because the Kishi Nobusuke government of Japan has consistently pursued a policy of following US imperialism, pleasing the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and being hostile to New China, China and Japan have not ended the state of war to this day. Under these circumstances, if following international practices, it would not have been possible for China and Japan to sign a fisheries agreement. However, in view of the situation in which Japan was suppressed by US imperialism after the war, and in view of the need for the people of China and Japan to establish and develop friendly relations, the China Fisheries Association signed a fisheries agreement on the Yellow Sea and East China Sea with the Japan-China Fisheries Council in April 1955. This agreement was supported by our government. In this agreement and its annexes, it is stipulated that Japanese fishing vessels shall not enter the trawler fishing prohibited areas, military alert areas, and military restricted areas set up by our government. After this agreement expired on June 13, 1956, the validity period was extended for another year with the consent and exchange of letters between the two fishery associations.

    Since the signing of this agreement, incidents of Japanese fishing vessels violating the agreement have occurred many times, and the China Fisheries Association has also promptly notified the Japanese side, requesting the Japanese side to pay attention. On the other hand, during this period, our relevant organizations have provided great assistance and care to Japanese fishing vessels and fishermen who came to our ports to seek shelter from the wind and disaster. This proves that the Chinese side has truly been friendly enough to the Japanese fishing industry.

    However, the actions of some Japanese fishing vessels not only disappoint us but also make people angry. These actions of Japanese fishing vessels are not accidental; they are actually implementing the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of hostility towards the Chinese people. Hidden behind these events is the ulterior motive of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Its nature is serious, and our people should be vigilant and pay attention to it.

    Our people fully support our Fisheries Association's protest to the Japanese side, and the relevant Japanese parties have a responsibility to compensate for all losses suffered by our fishermen.

    抗议日方破坏渔业协定
    最近几个月来，日本渔轮破坏中日渔业协定，撞坏我渔船，拖走我渔具，对我沿海渔民的生产和安全造成严重危害的事件是越来越多了。据初步了解，从今年3月15日到5月1日，日本渔轮侵入机轮拖网渔业禁渔区，造成破坏事件达十三次之多，使我渔民遭受几万元的损失。有的日本渔轮涂改船号，闯入禁渔区，有的还企图劫夺我渔船。5月1日日本“有明号155号”在浙江省玉环县坡山洋撞坏我钓船一只，致使渔民徐顺来落水淹死。对于日本渔轮这种不法行为，我国渔业协会已在5月6日向日本日中渔业协议会提出严正抗议，要求日方制止日本渔轮再有类似事件发生，并且要求赔偿我方渔民所受的一切损失。
    谁都知道，由于日本岸信介政府一贯地采取追随美帝国主义、讨好蒋介石集团而敌视新中国的政策，中日两国直到今天还没有结束战争状态。在这种情况下，如果按照国际间的惯例，中日两国之间本来是没有可能签订渔业协定的。但是，我国人民鉴于战后日本受美帝国主义压制的情况，鉴于中日两国人民有必要建立和发展友好关系，我国渔业协会在1955年4月同日本日中渔业协议会签订了关于黄海、东海的民间团体的渔业协定。这个协定是得到我国政府支持的。在这个协定和附件中，规定日本渔轮不得进入我国政府设置的机轮拖网渔业禁渔区、军事警戒区和军事禁航区。这个协定在1956年6月13日期满之后，经过双方渔协的同意和换文，又延长有效期间一年。
    在这个协定签订以后，日本渔轮违反协定的事件曾经多次发生，中国渔业协会也及时地通告了日方，要求日方注意。另一方面，在这个期间，我国有关团体对于到我国港口前来避风和避难的日本渔轮和渔民，曾经给予很大的帮助和照顾，这就可以证明中国方面对于日本渔业界方面真正是做到够友好的了。
    但是一部分日本渔轮的行动，不但使我们感到失望，而且使人们感到愤怒。日本渔轮的这种行动并不是偶然的，它实际上执行了岸信介政府敌视中国人民的政策。这些事件背后隐藏着岸信介政府的不可告人的目的。它的性质是严重的，我国人民应该加以警惕和注视。
    我国人民完全支持我国渔业协会对于日本方面的抗议，日本有关方面有责任赔偿我国渔民所遭受的一切损失。
