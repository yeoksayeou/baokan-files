　　Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch: Washington news: The "Washington Post" published a report on May 4, describing the impact of the American economic crisis on the Japanese economy.

　　The newspaper quoted Saburo Okita, Director-General of the Overall Planning Bureau of the Japanese Economic Planning Agency, as saying that the American economic recession has had "some impact" on certain sectors of the Japanese economy. For example, new orders for machinery and ships for export have been greatly reduced, and the overall economic situation is stagnant.

　　The American newspaper quoted the "Japan Times" as saying that the American economic recession has dealt a heavy blow to Japan's exports of textiles, metal tableware, canned food, pottery, toys and plywood. Hopes that the United States would relax import restrictions are slim.

　　The "Washington Post" admitted that the impact of the American economic recession on Japan has already "shown some dangerous signs": production in some economic sectors has decreased, and the overall employment situation is deteriorating because large industries are not currently hiring new workers. According to Japanese government statistics, the number of registered fully unemployed people in February was already 570,000, an increase of 30% compared to the end of 1957. However, the newspaper pointed out that this statistic is likely to be much more embellished than the actual number, because workers who are only employed for one hour a day in Japan are not counted as unemployed.

　　The "Washington Post" also quoted a recent report submitted to the cabinet by the Japanese Population Problems Council. The report pointed out that even before the full impact of Japan's monetary tightening policy and the American economic recession are felt, Japan already has 4.3 million people without formal employment contracts, who are only employed on an hourly or daily basis, or whose income is not enough to meet the minimum living needs. In addition, there are young students who have recently completed their studies and entered the labor market. Therefore, the problem is becoming increasingly serious. The "Mainichi Shimbun" said that only about half of the high school and junior high school students who graduated in March this year found jobs.

　　The "Washington Post" used Saburo Okita's words to point out that if the current downward trend in employment continues for a long period, the impact on the country's economy may be "disastrous."

　　The newspaper said that the concerns in Tokyo and Osaka about the current American economic recession underscore the extent to which Japan relies on the continuous increase in international trade. Japan does not have much economic "fat" reserves to tide it over difficult times, so even a relatively small decline in business activity causes deep unease.

　　Xinhua News Agency, London, 9th dispatch: The British "Daily Herald" published an article written by Hutchinson on the 5th. Hutchinson reported on the deteriorating economic situation in the important industrial region of Northwest England, and anxiously raised the question: "Can Britain avoid an economic crisis?"

　　Hutchinson pointed out that in the Northwest region, unemployed people exceed 65,000, every city there has closed factories, and many factories only operate four days a week. Hutchinson said that in Lancashire (the center of the British textile industry), "the job problem is indeed very serious," and "Lancashire's future is at a dangerous turning point of depression." In 1951, there were 275,000 workers in the textile industry, but today there are only about 200,000.

　　Hutchinson pointed out that in Merseyside, 13% of ship repair workers are unemployed, and more are working short hours. 10% of construction workers cannot find jobs, and dockworkers have decreased from 18,000 to 14,000.

　　Hutchinson pointed out that old ships are already idle, some new ship construction orders have been cancelled, and no new orders have been placed, while "shipbuilding, ship repair, docks, warehouses, and maritime transport are the lifeblood of Liverpool and Birkenhead, Bootle, and Garston (and other cities)."

### 美国经济危机继续蔓延  日本经济活动发生险象  英格兰西北部工业地区一片萧条

　　美国经济危机继续蔓延
    日本经济活动发生险象
    英格兰西北部工业地区一片萧条
    新华社11日讯　华盛顿消息：“华盛顿邮报”5月4日发表一篇报道，叙述美国经济危机对日本经济所产生的影响。
    这家报纸引用了日本经济企划厅总合计划局长大来佐武郎的话说，美国经济衰退已经对日本某些经济部门发生“某种影响”，例如，供输出的机器和船舶的新定货单大大减少了，总的经济情况是停滞的。
    这家美国报纸引述“日本时报”的话说，美国的经济衰退已经给予日本的纺织品、金属餐具、罐头食品、陶器、玩具和胶合板等货物的输出以很大的打击。美国对输入的限制会放宽很多的希望是很渺茫的。
    “华盛顿邮报”承认，美国经济衰退对日本的影响已经“有了一些危险的讯号”：某些经济部门的生产减少了，由于大工业目前不雇新工人，总的就业情况正在恶化。根据日本政府的统计数字，已经登记的完全失业人数2月份已经有五十七万人，比1957年年底增加了30％。但是，报纸指出，这个统计数字很可能比实际的数字粉饰了很多，因为在日本每天只被雇用一小时的工人是不算失业的。
    “华盛顿邮报”还引用了日本人口问题审议会最近向内阁提出的报告。这个报告指出，甚至在日本金融紧缩政策和美国经济衰退的全部影响被感觉到以前，日本已经有四百三十万人没有正式的工作合同，只是按时按日雇用，或是收入还不够最低的生活需要。此外，还有在最近学业完成进入劳工市场的青年学生。因此这个问题越来越严重了。“每日新闻”说，今年3月毕业的高中和初中学生只有大约一半找到工作。
    “华盛顿邮报”用大来佐武郎的话指出，如果目前就业人数这种下降趋势继续很长一个时期，对这个国家的经济的影响可能是“灾难性”的。
    这家报纸说，东京和大阪对目前美国经济衰退产生的忧虑着重说明了日本依靠国际贸易额的不断增加达到什么程度。日本赖以度过困难时期的经济“脂肪”储备是不多的，因此即使是工商业活动中比较小的下降也引起了深切的不安。
    新华社伦敦9日电　英国“每日先驱报”5日刊载了哈钦森撰写的一篇文章，哈钦森报道了英格兰西北部这一重要工业地区经济恶化的情况，并且不安地提出了这样的问题：“英国能避免一次经济危机吗？”
    哈钦森指出，在西北地区失业者超过六万五千人，那里每个城市都有关门的工厂，还有很多工厂一星期只开工四天。哈钦森说，在（英国纺织业中心）兰开夏地区，“工作问题确实是很严重的”，“兰开夏的前途处在萧条的危险关头”。1951年，在纺织工业内有二十七万五千名工人，而今天只有大约二十万人。
    哈钦森指出，在默西夏有13％的船舶修理工人失业，更多的人则在做短时工作，10％的建筑工人找不到工作，码头工人由一万八千人减少到了一万四千人。
    哈钦森指出，现在旧船已经在闲置不用，一些新船的建造订货单已经取消，而且没有新的订货单提出来，而“造船、修船、船坞、仓库和海上运输却是利物浦和柏肯黑德、包特尔和加斯敦（等城市）的生命”。
