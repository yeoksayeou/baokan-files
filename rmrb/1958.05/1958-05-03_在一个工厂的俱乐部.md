    In a Factory Club
    By our reporter Cui Yongchang
    The afterglow of the setting sun dyed a bay of the Moscow River red, and a gentle breeze rippled across the water. The workday ended, and the workers of the Moscow Silk Factory walked out of the factory gates. We were also invited to attend an evening party held by the factory club.
    We saw that worker Mishelyakov ran straight to the club not far from the factory as soon as he left the workshop. He found his companions in a room on the second floor, picked up their instruments, and went backstage to rehearse, preparing to perform at the evening party. This time, it was originally an evening party to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their folk band, how could they not practice more!
    There was still an hour before the evening party started. Taking advantage of this time, we asked Comrade Krasnovsky, the director of the club, to introduce the general situation of the club to us.
    The Moscow Sverdlov Silk Factory is a large factory with more than 3,000 workers, and all the cultural activities of these workers are organized by the club. Comrade Krasnovsky said that the club's work is divided into several parts. First, it conducts political and technical propaganda and education for employees. The club regularly organizes reports. A series of reports are planned for April and May. In the political field, there are: the current international situation, the development of the international workers' movement, the struggle against modern revisionism, the resolutions of the March Plenary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, etc.; in the fields of science, technology, literature and art, there are: the peaceful use of atomic energy, new achievements in Soviet medicine, Gorky's on socialist realism, etc. All reports are the responsibility of the Frunze District Branch of the Political and Scientific Knowledge Popularization Association. Another task is to organize various evening parties. In addition to this, the club also regularly organizes visits. The workers of this factory recently visited the Lenin Central Museum. After the arrival of spring, Sunday outings and hiking trips for young workers are also organized.
    The opening time of the evening party was approaching. Music was already being broadcast in the hall, and the workers came to the club after dinner and changing their clothes. Various activity rooms in the club also became lively. In a small room, we saw a glass screen prepared for workers to watch television programs. In another room, seven or eight young people were compiling a wall newspaper to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the workers' folk band, and Streltsov, the secretary of the factory's Communist Youth League, was pondering a title for an article. In the third room, several young girls were sorting out brightly colored costumes. These were members of the folk song choir preparing to perform. Comrade Krasnovsky introduced to us that in addition to the folk song choir, the club also has nine amateur groups including a folk band, a drama group, a dance group, and rhythmic gymnastics. More than 350 members participate in amateur activities. These groups all have fixed experts to lead them.
    Backstage, we saw the members of the folk band who were celebrating their birthday today. Poriak, a master of the three-stringed instrument, is a young worker in his twenties and an electrician. He has liked folk instruments since he was a child, but he also works hard in his studies. He has already graduated from the workers' night school and is preparing to apply for university during the summer vacation. When we asked him what school he was going to apply for, he said: "I still like my own profession, I want to apply for the Textile Institute."
    The evening party began, and we followed the workers into the hall. There were more than 800 seats here. The red velvet curtain was gently pulled open, and thirty or so young workers dressed in Russian national costumes appeared in front of everyone. Before the performance, the Frunze District Committee of the Communist Youth League and the factory director congratulated them and presented gifts. The band's performance won warm applause from the workers. Streltnikova's solo was even more praised by everyone. Comrade Krasnovsky introduced to us that Streltnikova was still a worker in this factory a few years ago. Because she has a talent for singing, she has now become an opera singer at the Soviet Grand Theater. But she has not forgotten her factory, and she often comes to the club to perform for the workers.
    We spent a happy evening with the happy Soviet workers. In the middle of the night, when we bid farewell to the hosts and walked back to our residence on the quiet streets of Moscow, the beautiful songs and music still lingered in our ears. (Attached picture)

    在一个工厂的俱乐部
    本报记者　崔永昌
    落日的余辉染红了莫斯科河的一湾河水，微风吹过，水面上划出了条条波纹。一天的工作结束了，莫斯科丝绸工厂的工人们走出了工厂的大门。我们这时也应邀去参加这个工厂俱乐部举办的晚会。
    我们看到，工人米谢里亚柯夫一走出车间就一直跑到离工厂不远的俱乐部里来。他在二层楼的一个房间里找到了同伴，一起拿上乐器到表演厅的后台去练习，准备在晚会上表演。这一次原是为他们的民间乐队成立十周年举办的晚会，怎能不多多练习呢！
    离晚会开始还有一个小时。利用这个时间，我们请俱乐部主任克拉斯诺夫斯基同志向我们介绍了俱乐部的一般情况。
    莫斯科斯维德洛夫丝绸工厂是一个有三千多工人的大厂，这些工人的文化活动全由俱乐部负责组织。克拉斯诺夫斯基同志说，俱乐部的工作分几部分，首先是对职工进行政治、技术宣传教育工作。俱乐部定期组织报告会，4、5月份准备举行一系列报告会，在政治方面的有：目前国际局势，国际工人运动的发展，反对现代修正主义的斗争，苏联最高苏维埃三月全会的决议等；在科学技术和文学艺术方面的有：原子能的和平利用，苏联医学的新成就，高尔基论社会主义现实主义等。所有的报告全由政治、科学知识普及协会伏龙芝区分会负责。另外的一个工作就是组织各种晚会。除此以外，俱乐部还定期组织参观。这个工厂的工人不久前参观了列宁中央博物馆。春天来到以后还组织星期日郊游和青年工人的远足旅行。
    晚会的开幕时间快到了。大厅里已经播送出音乐，工人们吃过晚饭以后，换上了衣服来到俱乐部。俱乐部中各个活动室，也活跃起来了。在一个不大的房间里，我们看到了为工人们欣赏电视节目准备的玻璃银幕。在另外一个房间里，七八个青年人正在编排纪念工人民间乐队成立十周年的壁报，工厂的共青团书记斯特列尔别夫正在为一篇文章琢磨标题。在第三间屋子里，几个年轻的姑娘在整理鲜艳的服装。这是民歌合唱团的团员正在准备表演。克拉斯诺夫斯基同志向我们介绍说，这几个姑娘全是染色车间的工人，又是厂里唱歌的能手。俱乐部里除去民歌合唱团以外，还有民间乐队、戏剧小组、舞蹈小组和柔软体操等九个业余小组。参加业余活动的成员有三百五十多人。这些小组都有固定的专家领导。
    在后台我们看到了今天过生日的民间乐队的成员。三弦琴能手波里亚克是一个二十多岁的青年工人，是个电工。他从小就喜欢民间乐器，但是在读书方面也很用功。他已经在工人夜校的中学毕了业，准备暑假投考大学。当我们问他准备考什么学校时，他说：“我还是喜欢我自己这一行，我要考纺织学院。”
    晚会开始了，我们随着工人们走进大厅。这里一共有八百多个座位。红色天鹅绒的幕轻轻拉开，三十几个穿着俄罗斯民族服装的青年工人出现在大家面前。表演前，伏龙芝区共青团区委会和工厂厂长向他们表示了祝贺，并且赠送了礼品。乐队的表演博得了工人们热烈的掌声。斯特列尔尼可娃的独唱更是受到了大家一致的赞扬。克拉斯诺夫斯基同志向我们介绍说，斯特列尔尼可娃几年前还是这个工厂的工人，因为她有歌唱的天才，现在已经成了苏联大剧院的歌剧演员。但是她并没有忘掉自己的工厂，她经常到俱乐部来为工人们演出。
    我们和幸福的苏联工人一道度过了一个幸福的夜晚。夜半，当我们告别了主人，在莫斯科静寂的街道上走回寓所的时候，那优美的歌声和乐曲还萦绕在耳边。（附图片）
