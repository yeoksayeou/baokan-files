Xinhua News Agency, 19th: This year, more than 500,000 conscripted soldiers who enlisted under the Military Service Law have completed their active service in the People's Liberation Army and returned home to take up posts in production and construction.

Local governments and people warmly welcome these glorious veterans, promptly settling their lives and work and providing care and assistance in many ways. In many areas, returned soldiers with grassroots work experience and technical expertise have been assigned reasonable positions according to local production and work needs, "making the best use of their talents." Party and government leaders in various places also personally briefed the veterans on the progress of local production and construction over the past three years, encouraging them to settle down in production, work actively, and maintain and carry forward the glorious traditions of the People's Army.

The returned conscripted soldiers have returned to their localities, full of enthusiasm for building the motherland, and have happily taken up production, labor, work, or study posts. They all expressed that they will go all out, take the lead in the Great Leap Forward, and strive to be active participants in socialist construction. Many people immediately participated in production labor after returning to their hometowns. Eighty-five returned soldiers from the first district of Wei County, Hebei Province, went to the fields to produce alongside the farmers on the same day. The seven returned soldiers from Chengxiang Town, Wuming County, Guangxi Province, participated in water conservancy projects the next day and played an active leading role in the labor. At the same time, the returned conscripted soldiers also immediately joined the grassroots militia organizations and became the backbone of local reserve training and good teachers.

At present, many of these discharged soldiers have been elected as cadres and people's representatives by the local people. In Taoying Township, Yiyang County, Henan Province, thirty-three demobilized soldiers included ten who became production team leaders of agricultural cooperatives, fourteen who became accountants, six who became cooperative cadres, and one who was elected as secretary of the Communist Youth League branch. In the Tongxian area of Hebei Province, one-third of the demobilized soldiers were also elected as grassroots cadres. Many people enthusiastically praised them, saying that the People's Liberation Army is truly a great school. After three years of military service, they are literate and martial, eloquent and capable, and have trained young people into heroes!

While this year's batch of conscripted soldiers were discharged, a small number of conscripted soldiers who had completed their active service were also approved to remain in the team for extended service, subject to the needs of the country and the troops.

　　五十多万义务兵退伍回乡
    群众赞扬他们说：当兵三年，能文又能武，能说又能干
    新华社19日讯　根据兵役法首批应征入伍的义务兵，今年有五十多万人已经在解放军中服现役期满，退伍回乡，走上生产建设岗位。
    各地政府和人民热烈地欢迎这批光荣退伍的战士。及时地为他们安置了生活和工作，从多方面给予关怀和帮助。许多地区对一些具有基层工作经验和技术专长的退伍战士，也都根据当地生产和工作上的需要，作了“人尽其才”的合理安排。各地的党政负责人还亲自向退伍战士们介绍了当地三年来各项生产建设的情况，勉励他们安心生产，积极工作，保持和发扬人民军队的光荣传统。
    回到各地的退伍义务兵们，都满怀着建设祖国的热情，愉快地走上生产劳动或工作、学习岗位。他们一致表示：鼓足干劲，跃进当先锋，争取做社会主义建设的积极分子。许多人在回到家乡后，马上参加了生产劳动。回到河北省魏县一区的八十五名退伍战士，在当天就和农民一道下地生产。回到广西省武鸣县城厢镇的七名退伍战士，第二天就参加了兴修水利的工程，并且在劳动中发挥了积极带头作用。同时，回到各地的退伍义务兵，也都立即参加了基层民兵组织，成为当地预备役训练中的骨干力量和很好的教师。
    目前，这批退伍的义务兵已经有很多人被当地群众选为干部和人民代表。河南省伊阳县陶营乡三十三个退伍战士，有十人当了农业社的生产队长，十四人当了会计，六人当了社干部，一人当选为共青团支部书记。河北省通县专区的退伍战士中，也有三分之一的人被选为基层干部。许多群众都热烈地赞扬说，解放军真是个大学校，当三年兵能文能武，能说能干，把青年人一个个培养成了英雄好汉！
    在今年这批义务兵退伍的同时，也还有少部分已经服现役期满的义务兵，在服从国家和部队需要的条件下，被批准留队超期服役。
