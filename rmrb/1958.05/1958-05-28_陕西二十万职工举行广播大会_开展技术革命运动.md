Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 27th: In order to implement the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Party at the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City today held a broadcast mobilization rally for more than 200,000 workers across the province to launch a technical revolution movement. The meeting called on the vast number of workers on all production fronts to bravely engage in this battle, so that the technical revolution would rapidly form a massive mass revolutionary movement throughout the province.

    Like the vast number of workers across the country, the workers in Shaanxi Province have displayed a spirit of bold originality in the high tide of production and the technical innovation movement, and have trial-produced many new products. In Xi'an City alone, more than 500 new products have been trial-produced in four months. Workers in many units actively put forward rationalization proposals, improved tools and operating methods, and improved product quality, saving wealth for the country. These situations show that the technical revolution movement in the Shaanxi region has already begun. With these good foundations, the technical revolution can be rapidly pushed to a new climax.

    Shi Yizhi, Standing Committee Member of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Vice Governor of Shaanxi Province, Feng Zhi, Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Liu Jian, Deputy Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Liu Wenwei, Chairman of the Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, all spoke at today's meeting. They called on the vast number of workers throughout the province to break superstitions, summon up their energy, dare to think, dare to create, dare to innovate, and give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance, love, unity and cooperation, help each other, and promote common progress.

    At the meeting, units such as the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory and the Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory introduced their experiences in carrying out the technical innovation movement. Two years ago, the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory was a backward factory with low product quality and manual operation for most of the main production processes. However, because the factory leaders and the masses together continuously learned and innovated technology, some product indicators have now reached and exceeded advanced international levels, and many machines and tools have been created and imitated, enabling most manual operations to be replaced by machines. Recently, in order to further carry out the technical innovation movement, the factory held more than 30 technical airing and contending meetings, letting go of the masses to carry out airing and contending and debates on technical innovation. In more than a month, the workers put forward more than 2,900 rationalization proposals.

    After hearing the calls from the leaders and the introduction of the experiences of fraternal units at the broadcast rally, the vast number of workers were all jubilant and full of confidence, expressing their firm response to the Party's call, bringing out revolutionary vigor, and launching the technical revolution movement. On the spot, many units submitted letters of guarantee and proposals for launching the technical revolution movement.

    陕西二十万职工举行广播大会
    开展技术革命运动
    新华社西安27日电　为了贯彻党在“八大”二次会议上提出的社会主义建设总路线，陕西省和西安市今天举行了全省二十多万职工参加的开展技术革命运动的广播动员大会。会议号召各个生产战线上的广大职工，英勇地投入这个战斗，使技术革命迅速地在全省范围内形成一个声势浩大的群众革命运动。
    陕西省职工和全国广大职工一样，在生产高潮和技术革新运动中发挥了大胆独创的精神，试制成很多新产品。其中仅西安市四个月就试制成五百多种新产品。很多单位的工人积极提合理化建议，改进工具和操作方法，提高产品质量，为国家节约财富。这些情况说明陕西地区的技术革命运动已经开始，有了这些良好的基础，就可以迅速地把技术革命推向新高潮。
    中共陕西省委常委、陕西省副省长时逸之、中共西安市委书记冯直、青年团陕西省委副书记刘健和省工会主席刘文蔚，都在今天的大会上讲了话。他们号召全省广大职工破除迷信，鼓足干劲，大胆设想，大胆创造，大胆革新，发挥互助友爱团结协作的精神，互相帮助，共同促进。
    在会议上，西安人民搪瓷厂和西安农业机械厂等单位介绍了他们开展技术革新运动的经验。西安人民搪瓷厂在两年以前还是一个产品质量低劣、主要生产工序都用手工操作的落后工厂。但是由于工厂领导人员和群众一起，不断学习和革新技术，现在有些产品指标已经达到和超过国际先进水平，并创造和仿造了很多机器和工具，使大部分手工操作为机器所代替。最近，这个工厂为了进一步开展技术革新运动，举行了三十多次技术鸣放会议，放手发动群众进行技术革新的鸣放和辩论，一个多月的时间，职工就提出二千九百多条合理化建议。
    广大职工在广播大会上听到领导上的号召和兄弟单位的经验介绍以后，个个欢欣鼓舞，人人信心百倍，表示坚决响应党的号召，拿出革命干劲，开展技术革命运动。当场就有很多单位提出开展技术革命运动的保证书和倡议书。
