    Learn from Lessons and Make Early Arrangements
    The Wuxing Agricultural Cooperative in Chengguan Town, Cao County, Shandong Province, recently held a debate on how to do a good job in wheat harvesting and ensure that not a single grain of wheat is lost or becomes moldy.
    During the debate, everyone reviewed the wheat harvesting work in 1956. That year, due to the leadership's complacency, inadequate planning, and insufficient preparation, the cooperative lost more than 30,000 jin of wheat to mold, and another 33,000 jin sprouted.
    In order to ensure the success of this summer harvest, the members put forward more than 200 suggestions during the debate. Based on these suggestions, the cooperative management committee took the following measures: (1) On the basis of the "three guarantees," the teams universally promoted the "four guarantees" system of guaranteed harvesting, guaranteed threshing, guaranteed labor, and guaranteed management, and the "four fixings" method of fixing quality, fixing quantity, fixing responsibility, and fixing rewards and punishments, in order to strengthen the members' sense of responsibility for wheat harvesting management. (2) During the wheat harvest, in addition to allocating 15% of the labor force to manage spring-sown crops, the remaining 85% of the labor force will be fully invested in the wheat harvest, and a system of fixed personnel for harvesting, transportation, threshing, and guarding will be established. (3) Combine wheat harvesting and summer planting; rush to harvest and plant when it rains, and fight drought and spot-plant when it does not.

    接受教训早作安排
    山东曹县城关镇五星农业社，最近对如何做好麦收工作、保证不丢失不霉烂一粒小麦进行了辩论。
    在辩论中，大家回顾了1956年的麦收工作。那一年由于领导思想麻痹，计划不周，准备不充分，麦收中全社共霉烂小麦三万余斤，还有三万三千斤出了芽。
    为了保证做好这次夏收工作，在辩论中，社员们共提出了二百多条建议。社管理委员会根据这些建议，采取了如下措施：（1）在“三包”的基础上，各队向生产组普遍推行包收、包打、包工、包管理的“四包”制度和定质、定量、定责任、定奖惩的“四定”办法，以加强社员麦收管理的责任感。（2）麦收时，除拿出15％的劳力进行春播作物管理等工作外，其余85％的劳力全部投入麦收，并建立收割、推运、打场、看管等固定专人的制度。（3）麦收和夏种结合，有雨抢收抢种，无雨抗旱点种。
