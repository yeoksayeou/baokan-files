    Superstition and the Ordinary
  　Zhang Jiachun
    It may be hard for some people to believe: a primary school student of only fourteen years old has successively invented three tools: a water-powered gunpowder grinding mill, a ditch pole pulley soil-raising machine, and a lever soil-raising machine. This person is Zhang Yufu, a Young Pioneer from Lintao County, Gansu Province.
    Why is it that this child with only six years of primary school education has made such a great contribution? The answer lies here: a child's heart is often more precious than that of an adult, and a young mind can also create miracles. Little friend Zhang Yufu thought: "Uncles and aunties are all researching and creating for socialist construction. As a Young Pioneer, I should also contribute to socialist construction." In this way, after hard work, he finally created these three machines.
    Although these things are not yet "earth-shattering," their significance is significant. In the minds of some people, a kind of idol worship is at work, and blind superstition hinders technological innovation. The idols they worship are: "Foreign" - since foreign countries haven't succeeded yet, we want to do it, isn't this nonsense! "Famous" - since experts haven't researched it yet, who do we think we are? "Ancient" - for thousands of years, no one dared to touch such problems, humph, aren't we just asking for trouble! "Books" - ancient and modern books at home and abroad have not mentioned or recorded such problems. We only have so much knowledge, yet we fantasize, hey, what a joke!…
    All kinds of fallacies, in the final analysis, amount to only one thing: giving up on oneself. They believe that we ordinary people cannot possibly accomplish great feats. The fact is, of course, not so, but quite the opposite. Many ordinary people have done many extraordinary things, and history is written by these many ordinary people. Wang Chonglun invented the "universal tool tire," completing four years' worth of tasks in one year, and was recognized as "a person walking ahead of time"; Su Guangming of Heilongjiang was hailed as a "model of technological innovation," and they are all ordinary people. Historically, Michurin did not go to university, but who can deny the value of his labor? The famous physicist Faraday, and the scientist and politician Franklin were apprentices, and Edison and Nobel only attended primary school for a few days, yet they left valuable legacies to mankind. They are all ordinary people as well.
    Today, all walks of life in our country are full of energy and have set off an unprecedented Great Leap Forward. What the world has but we don't, we must have; what the world doesn't have, we must also have. This is the great spirit of our times. An important means to achieve this is to encourage bold thinking, dare to act, overthrow idols, break superstition, innovate technology, and produce more Wang Chongluns, Su Guangmings, Zhang Yufus...
    "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who put their heart into it." Today, our country has given us favorable conditions in all aspects. As long as we break superstition and think boldly, we ordinary people will create extraordinary achievements for our socialist construction cause.

### 迷信和平凡

    迷信和平凡
  　张家淳
    说起来也许有人不大相信：一个只有十四岁的小学生，竟接连创造发明了三项工具：水力碾火药盘、渠杆滑轮起土机和杠杆起土机。这个人就是甘肃省临洮县的少先队员张裕福。
    为什么这只有小学六年文化程度的孩子，却做出了这样大的贡献呢？答案在这里：赤子之心往往比成年人更可贵，幼小的心灵也能产生奇迹。张裕福小朋友心想：“叔叔伯伯们都在为社会主义建设研究创造，我是一个少先队员，也应该为社会主义建设出一把力。”这样，经过刻苦钻研，终于创造了这三项机械。
    虽然这些东西还没有“惊天动地”，但它的意义却是重大的。在某些人心中有种偶像崇拜在做怪，盲目地迷信妨碍了技术的革新，他们崇拜的偶像就是：“洋”——人家外国还没有成功呢，我们就要搞，这不是瞎胡闹吗！“名”——人家专家还没有研究出来，我们算老几？“古”——人家几千年的古人都没有敢碰过这样问题，哼，我们岂不是自找苦吃！“书”——古今中外的书籍上都没有提过、记载过这类问题，我们才有多少知识，就异想天开，嘿，笑话！……
    谬论种种，归根结蒂只有一个：自暴自弃。他们认为：我们这些平凡的人是不可能干出丰功伟绩来的。事实当然不是如此，而是恰恰相反，许多平凡的人做出了许多不平凡的事，历史正是这许许多多的平凡的人写出来的。王崇伦发明了“万能工具胎”一年完成四年任务，被公认为“走在时间前面的人”；黑龙江的苏广铭被誉为“技术革新的标兵”，他们都是平凡的人。从历史上看，米丘林没有进过大学，但是有谁能否认他的劳动价值？著名的物理学家法拉第，科学家和政治家富兰克林是学徒出身，爱迪生和诺贝尔只念过几天小学，却给人类留下了宝贵的遗产。他们也都是平凡的人。
    今天，我国各行各业，都鼓足了干劲，掀起了前所未有的大跃进。世界上有而我们没有的，我们一定要有；世界上没有的，我们也要有。这就是我们时代的伟大气概。我们一定要这样做，要实现它的一条重要手段就是要我们大胆思考，敢做敢为，打倒偶像破除迷信，技术革新，出现更多的王崇伦、苏广铭、张裕福……
    “世上无难事，只怕有心人”。今天，我们的国家在各方面给了我们有利的条件，只要我们破除迷信，大胆思考，我们这些平凡的人是会给我们的社会主义建设事业创造出不平凡的功绩来的。
