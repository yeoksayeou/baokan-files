(Xinhua News Agency Dispatch) According to Xinhua News Agency reports: The meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the eight member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in Moscow marks a new stage in the unbreakable unity and cooperation of socialist countries. Newspapers in various fraternal countries have published editorials, warmly congratulating the great achievements of the CMEA Moscow meeting.

The Soviet "Pravda" published an editorial on the 26th stating that the meeting of representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of the CMEA member countries marks a new stage in the development of cooperation and fraternal mutual assistance among socialist countries. The results of this meeting are an important contribution to the further development of the world socialist system and the strengthening of the great socialist camp.

The editorial said that this meeting directly implemented the principles of the Moscow Declaration of the representatives of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. It is a solemn manifestation of the indestructible unity of the world socialist camp and the fraternal Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries, built on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The editorial said that the experience of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies shows that economic cooperation among socialist countries is of great significance for the successful realization of national economic development plans, the development of science and technology, and the continuous improvement of the living standards of the working people. It is the multi-faceted economic cooperation of socialist countries that helps the world socialist economic system achieve rapid progress in the competition with capitalism.

Czechoslovakia's "Red Rights" published an editorial on the 24th entitled "Safeguarding Peace." The editorial said that since the imperialists' concentrated attack on the unity of socialist countries in the autumn of 1956 suffered a shameful defeat, the cause of unity, friendship, common cooperation, and concerted action among socialist countries has become particularly valuable and worthy of protection. Facts have convincingly proved that no country can build socialism in isolation, isolated from its friends, let alone permanently defend its independence and freedom in the face of increasingly frequent imperialist conspiracies.

The editorial, after pointing out that the current international situation is disturbing due to the Western countries' implementation of anti-peace policies, said that it is necessary to express regret that: it is precisely in this situation that bad changes have taken place in the relations between the countries of the socialist camp and Yugoslavia. It is particularly regrettable that the Yugoslav leaders have adopted a stance in assessing the international situation that clearly helps the most reactionary imperialist elements. Yugoslavia's erroneous "non-alignment" policy can only lead to weakening the unity of the peace front and benefit the enemies of peace and socialism.

Bulgaria's "Workers' Affairs" published an editorial on the 26th stating that the economic relations of the socialist camp countries have nothing in common with purely commercial viewpoints and selfish political calculations. The assistance given by the Soviet Union to socialist countries and anti-colonialist countries also has absolutely nothing in common with these viewpoints and calculations. The Marshall Plan, the Truman Doctrine, the Eisenhower Doctrine, etc., all have obvious imperialist and anti-socialist purposes. If U.S. imperialism gives dollars to a certain country, and this country considers itself a socialist country, then the socialism of this country is quite doubtful. The purpose of U.S. imperialism in assisting such a country is to antagonize it with the socialist camp and to divide the international workers' movement. Whoever views this issue in the opposite way is intentionally or unintentionally serving the imperialists and undermining the foundations of socialism.

    兄弟国家报刊欢呼经济互助委员会会议
    社会主义国家合作互助进入新阶段
    世界社会主义体系将要取得日新月异的成就
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：在莫斯科举行的八国经济互助委员会成员国共产党、工人党代表会议标志着社会主义国家牢不可破的团结与合作的新阶段。各兄弟国家的报纸纷纷发表社论，热烈祝贺经济互助委员会莫斯科会议的巨大成就。
    苏联“真理报”26日发表社论说，经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议标志着社会主义国家发展合作和兄弟互助的新阶段。这次会议的结果是对进一步发展世界社会主义体系和加强伟大的社会主义阵营的一个重要贡献。
    社论说，这次会议直接实现了社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表莫斯科会议宣言的原则，它是世界社会主义阵营、社会主义国家兄弟共产党和工人党之间建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的基础上的不可摧毁的团结的庄严的表现。
    社论说，苏联和各人民民主国家的经验说明，社会主义国家经济合作对成功地实现国民经济发展计划、对科学技术的发展和劳动人民生活水平的不断提高，有着重大的意义。正是社会主义国家的多方面的经济合作帮助世界社会主义经济体系在同资本主义竞赛中取得日新月异的成就。
    捷克斯洛伐克“红色权利报”24日以“维护和平”为题发表了社论。社论说，自从1956年秋天帝国主义者对社会主义国家的团结发动集中的进攻遭到可耻的失败以后，社会主义国家之间的团结、友谊、共同合作和各国一致行动的事业已经成为特别宝贵和应当保护的东西。事实已经令人信服地证实，没有一个国家能够孤立地建设社会主义，能够同它的朋友隔绝，更不要说能够在帝国主义阴谋日益增加的情况下永远保卫它的独立和自由。
    社论在指出目前的国际局势由于西方国家执行反和平政策而令人不安之后说，有必要表示遗憾的是：正是在这种局面下，社会主义阵营各国同南斯拉夫之间的关系发生了不好的变化。特别令人遗憾的是，南斯拉夫的领袖们在估价国际局势时采取了一种显然是帮助最反动的帝国主义分子的立场，南斯拉夫采取的错误的“不参加集团”的政策只能导致削弱和平阵线的团结，而有利于和平和社会主义的敌人。
    保加利亚“工人事业报”26日发表社论说，社会主义阵营国家的经济关系同纯商业观点和利己的政治打算毫无共同之点。苏联给予社会主义国家和反殖民主义国家的援助也绝对同这些观点和打算毫无共同之点。马歇尔计划、杜鲁门主义、艾森豪威尔主义等都有明显的帝国主义和反社会主义的目的。如果，美帝国主义给某一国家美元，而这个国家又自认为是社会主义国家，那么这个国家的社会主义是相当可疑的。美帝国主义援助这样的国家的目的在于使它同社会主义阵营对立和在于分裂国际工人运动。谁要是相反地看待这个问题，他就是有意无意地为帝国主义者服务和破坏社会主义的基础。
