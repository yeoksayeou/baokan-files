Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- With the rapid development of industrial construction in ethnic minority areas, the working class of all ethnic minorities is growing rapidly.

The number of ethnic minority workers in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was less than 500 before liberation. In 1957, it increased to more than 125,000, and this year it will increase to more than 150,000. In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, there are already more than 60,000 ethnic minority workers, more than ten times the number in 1949. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, a large number of Zhuang, Yao, Miao, Dong, and Mulam people have become workers who have mastered various technologies. In the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture of Jilin Province, Korean workers account for about half of the total number of workers in the prefecture. In the Li and Miao areas of Hainan Island, on the Kangzang Plateau, and on the border lines of Yunnan, a large number of ethnic minority industrial workers have also emerged.

In their work, ethnic minority workers often receive training and education from the Party and trade union organizations, and sincere assistance from Han workers. Now, many ethnic minority workers in various places have mastered relatively high skills, or have learned to manage industrial and mining enterprises, and have been selected as technicians, engineers, workshop directors, and factory directors, and countless advanced figures have emerged. The Tibetan youth miner shock team fighting in the Danba Mica Mine on the Dadu River completed the first five-year plan ahead of schedule in three years and nine months. Wu Liansheng, a Mongolian tractor driver in Inner Mongolia, has maintained the glorious title of advanced producer for five consecutive years.

At present, according to incomplete statistics, nearly two thousand industrial enterprises have been established in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities, including more than eight hundred large-scale modern industrial enterprises.

    少数民族工人队伍迅速成长
    在少数民族聚居地方建立了近二千个工业企业
    据新华社30日讯　随着民族地区工业建设的突飞猛进，各少数民族的工人阶级队伍正在迅速成长。
    新疆维吾尔自治区的少数民族工人，解放前不足五百人，1957年发展到了十二万五千多人，今年将增加到十五万多人。在内蒙古自治区，少数民族工人已有六万多人，比1949年增长十几倍。广西僮族自治区已有大批僮、瑶、苗、侗、仫佬等族人民的子弟，成为掌握各种技术的工人。吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州的朝鲜族职工，约占全州职工总数的一半。在海南岛黎、苗族地区，在康藏高原，在云南边疆国境线上，也都出现了大批少数民族的产业工人。
    各少数民族职工在工作中，经常得到党与工会组织的培养教育，和汉族职工的真诚帮助，现在，在各地少数民族职工中，已有很多人掌握了比较高的技术，或者学会了管理工矿企业，被选拔为技术员、工程师、车间主任和厂长，并涌现出无数的先进人物。战斗在大渡河畔丹巴云母矿的藏族青年矿工突击队，曾用三年零九个月的时间就提前完成了第一个五年计划。内蒙古蒙古族拖拉机手吴连生，曾连续五年保持着先进生产者的光荣称号。
    目前，根据不完全统计，少数民族聚居的地方已建立了近二千个工业企业，其中，相当规模的现代化工业企业有八百多个。
