    Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions' Party Committees Strengthen Socialist Education Courses, Integrating Teaching with Political Movements

    (Our Correspondent Wei Wenhua reports) Party committees in Jiangsu Province's higher education institutions are strengthening leadership in socialist education, improving teaching methods, and integrating political teaching with political movements.

    During the rectification movement, sixteen higher education institutions in Jiangsu Province strengthened leadership in socialist education. The education plan and overall work are decided and uniformly arranged by the Party committee, and Party organizations at all levels ensure implementation. In eleven schools across the province, deputy Party secretaries and Party member vice-presidents concurrently serve as directors of the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research offices. In other schools, a Party secretary or deputy secretary is primarily responsible for leading this work. Most schools have also merged the Party committee's propaganda department and the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research office or have them "work together in the same office." Through these measures, the Party committee directly takes charge of the work of the Marxist-Leninist teaching and research office. The schools have also rectified the ranks of political teachers, allocated a certain backbone, and enriched the strength of socialist education.

    Regarding socialist education and teaching, some Party committee leaders or Party member presidents and vice-presidents personally undertake teaching. Guo Yingqiu, Party secretary and president of Nanjing University, personally teaches philosophy to graduate students. The schools organize and train full-time political teachers in various ways, understand the ideological situation of young students, and learn to use class analysis to analyze students' thinking. The universities and colleges in Jiangsu organized two groups of political teachers, totaling over seventy people, to go to the countryside for labor training. Most teachers in the schools went to departments and classes to take on Party and Youth League work, going deep into reality and among the masses to undergo training and transform their thinking. After the political teachers went to the departments, they lived and rested with the students, becoming one with them, and the estrangement between teachers and students was eliminated. Through practice, political teachers deeply realized that there was indeed a considerable degree of dogmatism in past teaching, and they paid attention to improvement in practice. Teachers at Nanjing University and other schools have begun to conduct typical investigations and research on one class, one group, and one student. Many teachers pay attention to linking theory with practice when preparing and giving lectures, which is welcomed by students.

    Under the unified leadership of the Party committee, socialist education in the schools integrates political theory teaching with the Party's ideological work, closely linking it with current movements and the central tasks of each stage, as well as the students' thinking. Since the beginning of this semester, the schools have successively conducted education on domestic and international situations, the two types of contradictions, socialist competition, work-study programs, and being both Red and expert, resolving many ideological problems among students in a relatively thorough manner. Using the mass line's educational methods in teaching, the schools generally first mobilize the masses to speak out freely, post big-character posters, and hold exhibitions. After revealing a large number of facts, they then launch discussions and debates, with the masses educating the masses, so that students clearly recognize what should be destroyed and what should be established. This lively, concrete, and combative form of education educates both the students and the teachers themselves. Now, political thought and democratic life among students are unprecedentedly active. Through big-character posters and exhibitions, the schools have widely and deeply exposed the bourgeois ideology existing among young students. Through education, the vast number of young people have clearly recognized the political direction, and therefore actively demand "strengthening self-transformation," and have formulated and revised personal progress plans, striving towards the goal of being both Red and expert. Currently, the schools have launched a high tide of rectification, learning, and labor.

    江苏各高等学校党委加强社会主义教育课程
    结合政治运动开展教学
    本报讯　记者魏文华报道：江苏省各高等学校党委加强对社会主义教育的领导，改进教学方法，结合政治运动开展政治教学。
    江苏省十六所高等学校在整风运动中，加强对社会主义教育的领导，教育计划和整个工作都由党委决定和统一安排，各级党组织保证贯彻。全省有十一所学校由党委副书记、党员副院长兼任马列主义教研室主任，其他学校也都有一个党委书记或副书记主要负责领导这方面的工作；大部分学校并已将党委宣传部和马列主义教研室合并或者“合署办公”；通过这些措施，使党委直接抓起马列主义教研室的工作。各校还整顿了政治教师队伍，调配了一定骨干，充实了社会主义教育的力量。
    对社会主义教育教学，有些学校党委负责同志或党员院、校长亲自担任讲授，南京大学党委书记、校长郭影秋亲自为研究生讲授哲学课。各校对专职政治教师从各方面组织锻炼；对青年学生的思想情况进行了解，学习运用阶级分析观点去分析学生的思想。全省各院校又先后组织两批政治教师共七十余人下乡劳动锻炼，在校的教师大部下系、下班担任党、团工作，深入实际、深入群众去经受锻炼，改造思想。政治教师下系后，与学生同起同息，和学生打成一片，师生之间消除了隔阂。政治教师通过实践深刻地认识到过去教学中确实存在着相当严重的教条主义，在实践中注意改进。南京大学等校的教师已开始对一个班级、一个小组、一个学生进行典型调查研究，许多教师备课、讲课都注意联系实际，受到学生的欢迎。
    各校社会主义教育，在党委统一领导下，政治理论教学工作和党的思想工作结合起来，密切结合当前各项运动和每一个阶段的中心任务，以及学生的思想来进行教育。本学期开学以后，各校先后进行了国内外形势、两类矛盾、社会主义竞赛、勤工俭学、红与专等问题的教育，比较深透地解决了学生中间许多思想问题。教学中运用群众路线的教育方法，各校一般都是先发动群众大鸣大放，贴大字报，举办展览会，在揭发了大量事实的基础上，再展开讨论、争辩，由群众教育群众，使学生明确地认识到应该破什么，立什么。这种生动、具体、富于战斗性的教育形式，既教育了学生，也教育了教师本人。现在学生中政治思想和民主生活空前活跃。各校通过大字报、展览会，广泛地、深刻地揭露了青年学生中存在的资产阶级思想。通过教育，广大青年明确认清了政治方向，因而积极要求“加强自我改造”，纷纷制订和修改个人进步计划，向又红又专的目标努力。目前各校已掀起了整风、学习、劳动三高涨的热潮。
