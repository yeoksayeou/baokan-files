Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 23rd. The Tianjin Rice Research Institute, a rice research center for provinces and autonomous regions north of the Huai River, was recently established in the Yangzhuangkewa depression within Jinghai County, Tianjin Prefecture.

	This year, the institute will extensively rely on the masses to conduct surveys and research on soil distribution, water conservancy resources, planting systems, cultivation techniques, agricultural tool usage, rice varieties, and climate in the entire Tianjin Prefecture. It will propose comprehensive plans and major measures for expanding rice cultivation and increasing rice yield per unit area in different regions in the future.

	The most important characteristic of this institute is its integration with production. It is affiliated with a state-owned farm covering 20,000 mu for experimental research. It will also hire agricultural labor models from various places as consultants to help the institute determine research projects and summarize research results. The agricultural workers of the institute are agricultural cooperative members, cooperative cadres, and technical cadres with rice cultivation experience from various places, rotated once a year, so that the experience of the agricultural cooperatives can be exchanged with the experience of the institute, and the experience of various places can also be exchanged. Another feature of the research is its integration with education. A senior agricultural middle school has now been established there; high school graduates will also be recruited during the summer vacation and converted into a rice college. The researchers of the institute also serve as teachers in the school, applying the research results directly to teaching. The institute will also conduct two large-scale training sessions each year to train agricultural cooperative members and technical cadres to promote and improve rice cultivation techniques.

	This institute is directly led by the Tianjin Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China, and research stations and groups are also set up in various counties and townships, with the secretaries of the county and township party committees serving as station chiefs and group leaders, forming a research network centered on the institute.

	The transformation of the depression and the change of the cultivation system in Tianjin Prefecture have attracted the attention of all parts of the country. The saline-alkali land here can represent the areas along the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea north of Jiangsu Province. Yangzhuangkewa, where the institute is located, is a new rice area, and the experience here can be referenced by the newly opened rice fields in various northern provinces. It is also connected to the Tuanbokewa rice field area in the east, which also facilitates research and comparison. Tianjin Prefecture has the longest history of rice planting in the north and has accumulated certain farming experience. Rice has been planted in Renqiu, Wen'an and other counties for more than 300 years, rice has been planted in the suburbs of Tianjin for 100 years, and rice has been planted in the famous Xiaozhan rice production area for 84 years.

    北方扩种水稻的研究中心
    天津稻作研究所成立
    新华社天津23日电　淮河以北各省、自治区的稻作研究中心——天津稻作研究所，最近在天津专区静海县境内的杨庄窠洼地成立。
    这个研究所今年将要广泛地依靠群众进行天津专区全区的土壤分布、水利资源、种植制度、栽培技术、使用农具、稻作品种、气象等方面的调查研究，提出今后全区扩种水稻和提高不同地区水稻单位面积产量的全面规划和主要措施。
    这个研究所最主要的特点是与生产结合。它附设有一个拥有两万亩地的国营农场，供试验研究用；还要聘请各地的农业劳动模范作顾问，帮助研究所确定研究项目，总结研究成果。研究所的农业工人，是各地有稻作经验的农业社社员、社干部、技术干部，一年轮换一次，这样使农业社的经验能和研究所的经验交流，也可交换各地的经验。研究的另一个特点是和教育结合，现在一所高级农业中学已在那里建立；暑期还要招收高中毕业生，改为稻作学院。研究所的研究人员同时担任学校教师的工作，把研究的成果直接应用到教学中去。研究所还要每年进行两次大规模的训练，训练农业社的社员和技术干部以推广和提高稻作技术。
    这个研究所，受中共天津地委直接领导，各县、乡还设研究站、组，由县、乡的党委书记任站长与组长，以研究所为中心，形成研究网。
    天津专区的洼地改造、改变耕作制度引起了全国各地的重视。这里的盐碱地能代表江苏省以北的黄海、渤海沿岸的地区。研究所驻地杨庄窠洼是新稻区，这里的经验在目前北方各省新开辟的稻田地区都可以参考。这里东边与团泊洼稻田区相连，也便于研究比较。天津专区稻作种植历史在北方最长，已积累了一定耕作经验，任丘、文安等县种稻已有三百多年，天津市郊区种稻已有一百年，著名的小站稻产地种稻也有八十四年的历史。
