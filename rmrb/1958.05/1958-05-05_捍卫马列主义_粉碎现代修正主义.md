Beijing Commemorates the 140th Anniversary of Marx's Birth
Defend Marxism-Leninism, Smash Modern Revisionism
Yang Xianzhen, President of the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, said in his report: The Program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is an anti-Marxist-Leninist, thoroughly revisionist program that is in opposition to the Moscow Declaration.

Xinhua News Agency, 4th - To commemorate the 140th anniversary of the birth of Marx, the great teacher and leader of the world's proletariat, the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China, the Bureau for the Compilation of Works of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the Central High School of the Chinese Communist Party jointly held a commemorative meeting in Beijing on the afternoon of the 4th.

More than 1,500 people attended the commemorative meeting, including representatives from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, as well as well-known figures from all walks of life and diplomatic envoys from socialist countries stationed in China. When Lin Boqu, Dong Biwu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, Kang Sheng, Wu Yuzhang, Xu Teli, as well as Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Huang Yanpei, Chen Shutong, Cheng Qian, Qian Junrui, and the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dail, and the Soviet Union's Charge d'Affaires ad interim to China, Antonov, ascended to the rostrum, the audience burst into warm applause.

The commemorative meeting was presided over by Dong Biwu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In his opening remarks, he said that the world history of the past century has been a history of the gradual victory of Marxism in the world. Today, as we commemorate Marx, we must learn from his spirit of uncompromising struggle against all non-proletarian ideologies, wage a resolute struggle against modern revisionist ideas that deviate from Marxist revolutionary theory, and wage a resolute struggle to defend the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory and strive for the victory of communism.

Yang Xianzhen, President of the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report at the commemorative meeting. Yang Xianzhen said that Marx and Engels critically developed the achievements of the three major advanced trends of thought in 19th-century Europe—German classical philosophy, British classical political economy, and French socialism—and brilliantly created the theory of scientific communism. They scientifically analyzed and proved that capitalism would inevitably collapse and transition to the communist system, and elucidated the historical mission of the proletariat to create this communist society. Yang Xianzhen said that for more than a hundred years, under the guidance of Marxism, the world communist movement has achieved a series of brilliant victories, and Marx's great ideal has become a reality for more than 950 million people, accounting for more than one-third of the world's population. The world communist movement has achieved great development in the past year. The declaration of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of twelve socialist countries held in Moscow last year summarized the experience of the international communist movement over the past century, especially the past four decades. This declaration stipulates the common principles that the communist parties of all countries must abide by in socialist revolution and socialist construction, lays the ideological and political foundation for the unity of the communist parties of all countries, and strengthens the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This declaration and the "Peace Declaration" of the meeting of representatives of the communist and workers' parties of sixty-four countries have opened a new stage in the modern international communist movement. The Moscow Declaration is undoubtedly a programmatic document of epoch-making significance in the international communist movement. It is a continuation of the "Communist Manifesto" published more than a hundred years ago and a development of Marxism-Leninism.

Yang Xianzhen continued that the victory of the Chinese revolution was another great victory in the international communist movement after the October Revolution in the past century and also a great victory for Marxism. The Chinese Communists have always been faithful to Marxism-Leninism. The Party Central Committee, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, has insisted on combining the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution and resolutely opposed revisionism and dogmatism. Yang Xianzhen particularly emphasized that the rectification movement, which began last spring in accordance with Comrade Mao Zedong's policy on the correct handling of contradictions among the people, has achieved great results on the political, economic, and cultural fronts. The victory of the great rectification movement is also a great victory for Marxism in China.

Yang Xianzhen then criticized the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. He said that this program is an anti-Marxist-Leninist, thoroughly revisionist program that is in opposition to the Moscow Declaration. Yang Xianzhen said at the end of his report that in order to defend Marxism-Leninism and for the complete victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause, the world's conscious workers have further united to fight against the modern revisionism that has emerged in the international communist movement. We, the Chinese Communists and Marxists, also resolutely unite with comrades from all countries to thoroughly crush modern revisionism politically and theoretically, and to defend Marxism-Leninism, and to defend the unity of the international communist movement on the ideological basis of Marxism-Leninism. This is our sacred internationalist obligation to the international working class, and we must carry this struggle through to the end and make it achieve good results.

At the end of Yang Xianzhen's report, the audience burst into prolonged and enthusiastic applause.

The Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, Wang Dail, then spoke. He said that Marx's cause has never been as active and played such an important role as it does in the twentieth century, in our era. After the brilliant example of the Soviet Union, nothing proves the vitality and creativity of Marxism-Leninism more clearly than the victory of the Chinese People's Revolution.

Wang Dail pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is forging ahead firmly towards the glorious peak of socialism on the basis of Marxism-Leninism, forming a fraternal alliance with socialist countries. He said that now, some revisionists oppose the principles of Marxism in the name of creatively developing Marxism further. Therefore, when we commemorate Marx, the first thing we think of is: unwavering loyalty to Marxism-Leninism. We vow to uphold the international solidarity of the working class and regard its highest achievement—proletarian internationalism—as the forever unchanging and firm foundation of all our policies.

Wang Dail's speech was interrupted by enthusiastic applause from time to time.

Huang Yanpei then recited his poem "Ode to Marx" at the commemorative meeting.

At the end of the commemorative meeting, the audience stood up and the band played "The Internationale." (Attached picture)

    北京举行马克思诞辰一百四十周年纪念大会
    捍卫马列主义　粉碎现代修正主义
    中共中央高级党校校长杨献珍在报告中说：南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领是一个反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，是同莫斯科会议的宣言相对抗的
    据新华社4日讯　为了纪念全世界无产阶级的伟大导师和领袖马克思诞辰一百四十周年，中华人民共和国文化部、中共中央马恩列斯著作编译局、中共中央高级党校4日下午在北京联合举办纪念大会。
    出席纪念大会的有中共中央和各民主党派的代表以及各界著名人士和社会主义国家驻华外交使节等共一千五百多人。当林伯渠、董必武、张闻天、陆定一、康生、吴玉章、徐特立以及李济深、沈钧儒、黄炎培、陈叔通、程潜、钱俊瑞和德意志民主共和国驻中国大使汪戴尔、苏联驻中国临时代办安东诺夫等登上主席台时，全场响起了热烈的掌声。
    纪念会由中共中央政治局委员董必武主持。他在开幕词中说，近百年来的世界历史就是马克思主义在世界上逐步胜利的历史。我们今天纪念马克思，就必须学习他生前同一切非无产阶级思想进行不调和斗争的精神，同离开马克思主义革命理论的现代修正主义思想进行坚决的斗争、为保卫马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性、为争取共产主义的胜利而进行坚决的斗争。
    中共中央高级党校校长杨献珍在纪念会上做了报告。杨献珍说，马克思和恩格斯一起批判地发展了十九世纪欧洲三大先进思潮——德国古典哲学、英国的古典政治经济学和法国的社会主义的成果，并且天才地创立了科学的共产主义理论。他们科学地分析证明了资本主义必然崩溃，而过渡到共产主义制度，阐明了无产阶级的历史使命就是创立这种共产主义社会。杨献珍说，一百多年以来，在马克思主义的指导下，全世界共产主义运动已取得了一系列的辉煌胜利，马克思的伟大理想已经在占全世界三分之一以上的九亿五千多万人口中变成了事实。一年来全世界共产主义运动又获得了巨大的发展。去年在莫斯科举行的十二个社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的宣言，总结了一百年来特别是近四十年来的国际共产主义运动的经验。这个宣言，规定了各国共产党在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中必须遵守的共同原则，奠定了各国共产党团结的思想政治基础，加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，这个宣言和六十四个国家的共产党和工人党代表会议的“和平宣言”，开辟了现代国际共产主义运动的新阶段。莫斯科宣言无疑是国际共产主义运动中具有划时代意义的纲领性的文件，是一百多年前所发表的“共产党宣言”的继续，是马克思列宁主义的发展。
    杨献珍接着说，中国革命的胜利，是一百年来国际共产主义运动中继十月革命以后的又一次巨大胜利，也是马克思主义的一次巨大胜利。中国共产党人一贯忠实于马克思列宁主义，以毛泽东同志为首的党中央，坚持把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践相结合，坚决反对修正主义和教条主义。杨献珍特别强调指出：从去年春季开始了的、按照毛泽东同志关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针展开的整风运动，在政治、经济、文化各个战线上已经取得了伟大的成效。伟大的整风运动的胜利也就是马克思主义在中国的巨大胜利。
    杨献珍接着批判了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会通过的纲领。他说，这个纲领是一个反马克思列宁主义的、彻头彻尾的修正主义的纲领，是同莫斯科会议的宣言相对抗的。杨献珍在报告的最后说，为了保卫马克思列宁主义，为了无产阶级革命事业的彻底胜利，全世界觉悟的工人已经进一步团结起来，同国际共产主义运动中出现的现代修正主义进行斗争。我们中国共产党人和马克思主义者，也坚决地和各国同志们团结在一起，为了在政治上和理论上彻底粉碎现代修正主义，为了保卫马克思列宁主义，为了保卫国际共产主义运动在马克思列宁主义的思想基础上的统一而斗争。这是我们对国际工人阶级的神圣的国际主义义务，我们一定要把这个斗争进行到底，并且使它收到良好的效果。
    杨献珍报告结束时，全场响起了长时间的热烈掌声。
    德意志民主共和国驻华大使汪戴尔接着讲了话。他说，马克思的事业从来没有像二十世纪、在我们的时代这样活跃，具有如此重大的作用。在苏联的辉煌榜样之后，没有什么能比中国人民革命的胜利更清楚地证明马克思列宁主义的生命力和创造力了。
    汪戴尔指出，德意志民主共和国同社会主义国家结成兄弟联盟，在马克思列宁主义基础上，正坚定不移地向社会主义的光荣高峰前进。他说，现在，有一些修正主义者反对马克思主义的原则，美其名为创造性地进一步发展马克思主义。因此，当我们纪念马克思时，首先想到的是：不可动摇地忠于马克思列宁主义。我们宣誓要维护工人阶级的国际团结，并把它的最高成果——无产阶级国际主义，看做是我们全部政策的永远不变的牢固基础。
    汪戴尔的讲话，不时被热烈的掌声所打断。
    黄炎培接着在纪念会上朗诵了他所作的诗“马克思颂”。
    纪念会结束时，全场起立，乐队高奏“国际歌”。（附图片）
