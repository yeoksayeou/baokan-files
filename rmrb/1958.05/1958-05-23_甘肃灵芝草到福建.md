A Fujian Provincial Transportation Delegation recently brought back a Lingzhi herb from Gansu. It was harvested by farmers in Wen County, Gansu Province, from a decaying ancient tree in the deep mountains, and presented to the people of Fujian Province by the Wen County People's Committee. On the 20th, this Lingzhi herb was delivered to the Fujian Provincial Museum and will be publicly displayed.

This Lingzhi herb has a fan-shaped cap on top with a radius of about two inches. The cap has cloud-like patterns. Below it is a stem with a diameter of about half an inch. The entire length, including the root, is about eight inches. It is now dried. The cap and stem have changed from red or purplish-red to purplish-brown, and the root is yellowish-brown.

Lingzhi herb, also known as Zhi herb, Ling herb, or Purple Zhi, is a type of fungus that parasitizes dead trees. In ancient times, it was said that "eating Lingzhi can lead to immortality," hence it is also called fairy grass or the elixir of life. According to experienced practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, Lingzhi herb mostly has tonic properties, but it is necessary to determine whether the tree it parasitizes and the nutrients it absorbs contain toxic substances in order to determine whether it can nourish the body.

    甘肃灵芝草到福建
    福建省交通参观团最近从甘肃带回来了一株灵芝草。它是甘肃省文县农民从深山中的一棵枯朽的古树上采获，由文县人民委员会赠送给福建省人民的。20日，这株灵芝草已送交福建省博物馆，将公开展览。
    这株灵芝草上面有个半径约两寸的扇形盖，盖上有云彩纹状，下面连有直径约半寸的茎，连同根部全长约八寸，现在都已干化，盖、茎都由红色或紫赤色变成紫褐色，根部呈土黄色。
    灵芝草又名芝草、灵草或紫芝，是一种菌类植物，寄生在枯死的树上。古时相传“吃了灵芝可以长生不老”，因此又称仙草或不死药。据有经验的中医说，灵芝草大多有补质，但是要看它寄生的树木和所吸收的养分有无毒质，才能确定能否补养身体。　（新华社）
