Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The Central Committees of all democratic parties unanimously support the general line for socialist construction formulated by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. They expressed their determination to carry the rectification movement through to the end under the guidance of the general line and to accelerate the transformation of their own thoughts and positions in the movement.

The Rectification Work Committee of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has made a decision requiring all members to conscientiously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in conjunction with the KMT's internal rectification, to implement the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and to criticize modern revisionism. The rectification groups of the Central Committee of the KMT held their first symposium on the 28th to discuss the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Many people made speeches at the meeting in connection with their own political and ideological situation. They expressed their determination to carry the self-revolution through to the end and transform themselves into completely new socialist people as soon as possible.

Central Committee members, alternate Central Committee members, and full-time cadres of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League in Beijing held a discussion on the 29th on the reports and resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Speakers pointed out that the brilliant socialist construction general line illuminates all construction departments in our country, and the people of the whole country will certainly be able to complete the great construction task under the leadership of the Party. After the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the political consciousness of the members of the democratic parties has generally been improved, but they cannot be complacent because of this. They must thoroughly transform themselves and must never slacken off halfway. At the same time, they must resolutely oppose modern revisionism.

Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy in Beijing also held a symposium on the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the 29th. Everyone expressed in their speeches that they would conscientiously and thoroughly transform themselves in the socialist revolution and contribute their greatest strength to the implementation of the general line of socialist construction. The Central Committee of the CAPD also decided that when systematically studying the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, it is necessary to fully open up thinking, boldly speak out and debate in connection with the major issues exposed in the rectification.

The Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party believes that the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the general line for socialist construction formulated at the meeting have once again pointed out the correct direction for them, and are a great encouragement to their ongoing essential transformation and the struggle to eliminate the influence of the Rightist clique on the Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party. The Central Committee of the CPWDP called on all members to conscientiously study the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China on the basis of the achievements already made in the rectification, seriously criticize modern revisionism, and transform the CPWDP into a true political force serving socialism.

Central Committee members and members of the China Zhi Gong Party in Beijing also held a symposium to study the documents of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. They unanimously expressed their determination to support and implement the general line of socialist construction with practical actions; while working hard, actively transform their thinking to ensure that they become firm leftists as soon as possible.

The Central Committee members of the Jiusan Society in Beijing and the members participating in the rectification of the Central Committee of the Society unanimously believe that the reports and resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China have brought them great encouragement and strength. They all expressed that they will accelerate the essential transformation of "promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology" so that they can become new-type intellectuals who are both red and expert, and deeply proficient in their fields as soon as possible. Everyone is determined to lead all members with practical actions under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and, together with the people of the whole country, fully complete the glorious tasks of the technological revolution and the cultural revolution.

Members of the rectification and study group of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League unanimously agreed in the discussion that the general line of socialist construction always runs through the word "gan" (work hard), and felt that the "situation is compelling," and that it is impossible not to make progress. They expressed that they would transform themselves well through rectification, formulate personal plans, catch up with the train of the times, and contribute all their strength to the realization of the general line.
