Sugarcane, besides being used for sugar production, has three main by-products: sugarcane bagasse, molasses, and filter mud. Sugarcane bagasse can be used to make pulp, paper, rayon, furfural (a plastic raw material), and can also be used as fuel, with the ash usable as scouring powder. Molasses can be used to make alcohol, "leaky wine" (wine made from molasses), soy sauce, edible syrup, liquid and solid carbon dioxide, edible or feed yeast, and can also be used to extract glycerin and butanol, among other things. B-grade molasses can also be used to extract aconitic acid (a chemical), and filter mud can be used to extract high melting point sugarcane wax, and can also be used as fertilizer. After processing 9,000 jin of sugarcane, 1,100 jin of white sugar, 50 jin of alcohol (or 100 jin of "leaky wine"), 500 jin of paper (or 550 jin of pulp or 330 jin of rayon), 400 jin of cardboard (or 120 jin of furfural), 6 jin of sugarcane wax, and 1 jin of aconitic acid (a chemical) can be produced.

    甘蔗
    甘蔗除制糖外，有三种主要副产品。即甘蔗渣、废糖蜜、滤泥。甘蔗渣可做纸浆、纸、人造丝、糠醛（塑料原料），也可当作燃料，灰还可作去污粉。废糖蜜可作酒精、漏水酒（用废糖蜜做的酒）、酱油、食用糖浆、液固体二氧化炭、食用或饲料酵母，还可提取甘油、丁醇等。乙原蜜（乙种糖糕蜜）还可以提取乌头酸（化学药品）、滤泥可以提取高溶点的蔗蜡，还可作肥料。九千市斤甘蔗加工后可制白砂糖一千一百市斤，酒精五十市斤（或漏水酒一百市斤），纸五百市斤（或纸浆五百五十市斤或人造丝三百三十市斤），纸板四百市斤（或制出糠醛一百二十市斤），蔗蜡六市斤，乌头酸（化学药品）一市斤。（附图片）
