Comrade Shaoqi at the Pixian Tractor Station

Pixian County, the first "thousand-jin county" in the West Sichuan Plain, has already taken its first step towards agricultural mechanization. On this fertile land of ripening wheat and green rice, farmers are driving newly purchased tractors for the agricultural cooperatives, tilling the black, oily soil for the first time. Planning work for irrigation canals, machine-plowed roads, and residential areas, adapted to the requirements of mechanized farming, is underway. The technical school newly established by the Pixian Tractor Station has already started, with over a hundred young cooperative members studying part-time and working part-time.

Comrade Liu Shaoqi's instructions at the Pixian Tractor Station not long ago have become a huge force driving the people of the whole county to strive for mechanization within three years.

It was one afternoon in March. Most of the employees of the Pixian Tractor Station were working in the fields. Comrade Shaoqi arrived here. Upon hearing the news, Zhao Jingyi, the station chief, and Yin Zhun, the deputy station chief, rushed back. Comrade Shaoqi had just gotten out of the car. Without resting, he cordially inquired about the station's machinery, land, and other conditions, and then walked to the machinery depot.

These were two rows of tall tile-roofed houses. White and red tractors, harvesters, threshers, and other machines were parked in rows. Comrade Shaoqi carefully watched each piece of machinery, listening to Zhao Jingyi's introduction. He asked about the tillage capacity of each machine. Comrade Shaoqi stopped in front of a "Hotchkiss 35" tractor with high rubber tires. He asked Zhao Jingyi, "Can it till paddy fields?"

Zhao Jingyi replied, "This type of tractor can transport and also till paddy fields."

Upon hearing this answer, Comrade Shaoqi especially carefully walked around the tractor, asking, "Is it okay to till like this?"

Zhao Jingyi replied, "You have to remove the rubber tires and replace them with iron wheels."

The experiment of modifying the iron wheels was conducted by the tractor station itself. Comrade Shaoqi was very interested in this meaningful work. Zhao Jingyi led him to another machinery depot. On the way, when he saw two young workers repairing gears on a car, he stopped. Comrade Shaoqi walked to their side, watching their work with concern.

Comrade Shaoqi turned around and asked Zhao Jingyi, "Where are they from?" Zhao Jingyi said that they were originally members of the agricultural cooperative. The tractor station held training courses to train farmer tractor drivers, and later, some trainees stayed. Seeing these rural youths, who knew very little about science a few years ago, grow up so quickly, Comrade Shaoqi seemed very happy. At this time, everyone naturally thought that cultivating a large number of technical talents for agricultural cooperatives in the process of realizing agricultural mechanization is indeed an indispensable part of the work of the tractor station. Comrade Shaoqi walked and asked about the station's staffing, financial income, and expenditure. Every word he said was so modest and amiable that everyone felt as intimate as being with their own father or elder brother. In the fifth machinery depot, which stored iron wheels, Comrade Shaoqi bent down, touched the toothed iron wheel with his hand, and asked, "This iron wheel is very heavy, right?" Zhao Jingyi replied, "The iron wheel is very wide, so it doesn't sink deep in the paddy field. It is much better to till with it than with other tires."

Comrade Shaoqi said with satisfaction, "Very good."

Comrade Shaoqi's concern for the issue of mechanized paddy field farming left the people at the tractor station unable to calm down for a long time. Yes, why not think of ways to make the iron wheels lighter and more flexible to operate? In Sichuan, paddy field area accounts for more than 50% of the total cultivated area. They deeply felt that their responsibility in solving this problem was significant.

Comrade Shaoqi walked to the cultivation area of the tractor station. Whether at the edge of the wheat field, in the rapeseed field, or at the small hydropower station newly built by the station, he concernedly raised various questions. He pointed out to everyone the importance of planting sweet potatoes to increase grain yield, and also mentioned that if single-season rice can yield more than a thousand catties, attention should also be paid to single-season rice...

Time passed quickly. Comrade Shaoqi had seen almost every part of the tractor station, and his energy was very strong. He stood on the drying ground next to the office building and continued to raise many important questions to everyone based on what he had seen at the station. The spring sun warmly shone on the people, and Comrade Shaoqi took off his hat from time to time and smoothed his gray hair with his hand. People gathered around him, listening quietly to his conversation.

This station was the first tractor station in Sichuan Province, established in 1954. Now it has thirteen mixed units of tractors, serving an area of more than ten thousand mu. Comrade Shaoqi said, "You should learn some experience to see which machines are suitable for this place." He also said, "The efficiency of the machines used here is not high." Liu Zhitai, the secretary of the Pixian County Party Committee who accompanied him, told Comrade Shaoqi that the main reason for the low efficiency of the machines was that there were many canals and small plots of land here. Comrade Shaoqi said, "Then in terms of charging, the fields should be divided into several grades. Large fields can be charged less, and small fields can be charged more. Prices should be used to guide production." Liu Zhitai also mentioned another situation, saying that the crops here are not contiguous, and the ripening periods are inconsistent, which is also a problem.

At this time, Comrade Shaoqi said, "It is easier to use machines when agricultural cooperatives are larger, and crops can also be contiguous." Yang Wanxuan, deputy director of the Rural Work Department of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, who accompanied him, introduced that the average agricultural cooperative in Sichuan Province has only sixty-six households. Comrade Shaoqi said, "Too small." Liu Zhitai added that the average cooperative in Pixian County has one hundred and sixty households. Comrade Shaoqi thought it was still small. He cited the examples of some agricultural cooperatives in North China, where one cooperative has several hundred households. Comrade Shaoqi said, "You should plan, so that machines can play their efficiency. If you want to plant wheat, plant wheat in a large area; if you want to plant rapeseed, plant rapeseed in a large area." He said to Liu Zhitai, "Is this okay? You can organize agricultural cooperatives to discuss it."

Speaking of this, Comrade Shaoqi gave instructions on the form of running the tractor station. He said, "We should let agricultural cooperatives buy tractors themselves. You have to experiment to see which tractor is suitable." Comrade Shaoqi's instructions enlightened everyone. They felt that they had found an important direction in how to fully utilize the strength of the masses, and develop agricultural mechanization more, faster, better, and more economically.

Comrade Shaoqi then asked Yin Zhun, the deputy station chief, who was standing next to him with oil stains on his work clothes, "You work with machines. Are you a mechanic? You have to do some research. Tractors that seem suitable for use here may not be suitable for use in hilly and mountainous areas." So, Comrade Shaoqi, while using his hands to simulate the shape of the tractor, described in detail the characteristics that he envisioned the new type of tractor should have. He said, "We should manufacture a smaller one. Its consumption for a day's work is only equivalent to the cost of a cow plowing for a day. It can transport on the road, can pull hundreds of catties of things, and a plow can be hung behind it for deep plowing. If you install a wheel, like a wheelbarrow, it would be even better to take small roads. The person driving the machine does not necessarily have to sit on it; the machine body should not be too heavy, and one person can carry it away."

Comrade Shaoqi's words outlined a clear vision of mechanization for everyone. Some things that were considered difficult to achieve in the past did not seem like daydreams. People immediately discussed excitedly. At this time, Comrade Shaoqi explained again, as if saying: In inland China, how many plains are there like this? There are more mountains and fewer plains, so smaller machines are needed.

Comrade Shaoqi was about to leave the tractor station. He shook hands with the comrades at the station again and again, asking them to go back to work. Zhao Jingyi, Yin Zhun, and others stood by the roadside, watching Comrade Shaoqi leave.

Comrade Shaoqi left. The spirit of his instructions quickly spread to every corner of the county. The farmers' determination to realize agricultural mechanization within three years was even firmer and full of energy. Some preparatory work for the realization of agricultural mechanization was widely carried out throughout the county. The tractor station also formulated a new work plan including land consolidation, reform of the form of running the station, personnel training, and paddy field operations. They revised the charging standard for machine plowing. Nearly half of the tractors in the station have also been sold to agricultural cooperatives.

### 少奇同志在郫县拖拉机站

    少奇同志在郫县拖拉机站
    川西平原上的第一个千斤县——郫县，已经在农业机械化的道路上迈出了第一步。在这个麦黄稻绿的沃野上，农民们第一次驾驶着农业社新买的拖拉机，翻耕着黑油油的土地。适应机耕要求而展开的灌溉渠道、机耕道路和居民点的规划工作，正在紧张地进行。郫县拖拉机站新办的技术学校已经开学了，有一百多个青年社员在这里半工半读。
    刘少奇同志不久前在郫县拖拉机站所作的指示，现在已经成为推动全县人民为三年实现机械化而努力的巨大力量。
    那是3月的一天下午。郫县拖拉机站的职工，大部分都在田间劳动。少奇同志来到了这里。听见这个消息，拖拉机站站长赵京一和副站长尹准连忙赶回来。这时，少奇同志下车不久。他没有休息，就亲切地向他们询问起站内的机器、土地等情况，随后，走到了机具库。
    这是两排高大的瓦房。白色、红色的拖拉机、收割机、脱粒机等成排地停放着。少奇同志仔细地观看每一样机具，听着赵京一的介绍。他询问每台机器的耕作能力。在一台有着高大的橡胶轮胎的“热·托35型”拖拉机前面，少奇同志停下了。他问赵京一：“能耕水田吗？”
    赵京一回答说：“这种拖拉机能够运输，也能耕水田。”
    听见这个回答，少奇同志特别仔细地围着拖拉机看了一周，问道：“就这样耕作行吗？”
    赵京一回答说：“要把胶轮拆下来，换上铁轮就行了。”
    改装铁轮的试验是拖拉机站自己进行的。对这件有意义的工作，少奇同志感到很大的兴趣。赵京一就引着他到另一座机具库去。途中，当他看到两个青年工人正在修理汽车上的齿轮时，便停了下来。少奇同志走到他们的身边，关切地看着他们的工作。
    少奇同志转过身问赵京一：“他们是那里来的？”赵京一说，他们原来是农业社社员，拖拉机站举办过训练班，培养农民拖拉机手，后来，有些学员就留了下来。看到这两个几年前还对科学知道得很少的农村青年这样迅速地成长了起来，少奇同志显得很高兴。这时，大家很自然地想到，在实现农业机械化的过程中，为农业社培养大批技术人材，的确是拖拉机站工作中一个不可缺少的部分。少奇同志边走边问着站内的编制、财务收支等情况。他的每句话都是那么谦虚、和蔼，大家感到好像和自己的父兄相处一样亲切。在存放铁轮的第五机具库里，少奇同志弯下腰，用手摸着那带齿的铁轮，一边问道：“这个铁轮很重吧？”赵京一回答说：“铁轮很宽，所以在水田里陷得不深，耕起来，要比其他轮胎好得多。”
    少奇同志满意地说：“很好。”
    少奇同志对水田机耕问题这样关心，使拖拉机站的人们久久不能平静。是啊，为什么不能想办法使铁轮更轻些，操作起来更灵活一些呢？在四川，水田面积占总耕地面积的50％多。他们深深感到自己在解决这个问题方面的责任重大。
    少奇同志走到拖拉机站的耕作区。不论在麦田边、油菜地里或者站上新修的小型水电站中，他都关心地提出各种问题。他向大家指出栽种甘薯对增加粮食产量的重要性，也谈到，如果单季稻能收一千多斤的话，还应该注意单季稻……
    时间很快过去了。少奇同志几乎看过了拖拉机站的每一处地方，他的精力很旺盛。他站在办公楼旁的晒场上，就他在这个站里看到的情况，继续对大家提出许多重要的问题。春天的阳光温暖地照射在人们身上，少奇同志不时取下帽子，用手理理花白的头发。人们围在他身边，静静地听着他的谈话。
    这个站是四川省第一个拖拉机站，在1954年开始建立的。现在有拖拉机十三个混合台，服务面积有一万多亩。少奇同志说：“你们应该摸些经验，到底哪些机器在这个地方适用。”他又说道：“这里使用的机器，效率还不高。”陪同前来的中共郫县县委书记刘致台告诉少奇同志说，机器使用效率不高，主要原因是这里水渠多、田块小。少奇同志说：“那在收费上，应该把田地分为几等。大田可以少收点，小田可以多收点。应该用价格来指导生产。”刘致台又提到另一个情况，他说，这里作物不连片，成熟期不一致，也是一个问题。
    这时，少奇同志说道：“农业社大了，才好用机器，作物也好连片。”陪同来的中共四川省委农村工作部副部长杨万选向他介绍说，四川省平均每个农业社只有六十六户，少奇同志说：“小了。”刘致台补充说，郫县的社平均有一百六十户。少奇同志认为还是小。他举出华北一些农业社的例子，那里一个社有好几百户。少奇同志说：“你们应该规划规划，机器才能发挥效率。要种小麦，一大片都种小麦，种油菜，一大片都种油菜。”他对刘致台说：“这样行不行，你们可以组织农业社讨论讨论。”
    谈到这里，少奇同志对拖拉机站的办站形式作了指示，他说：“我们应该让农业社自己买拖拉机。你们要试验一下，看哪种拖拉机适用。”少奇同志的指示，使大家豁然开朗，他们感到，在怎样充分发挥群众力量，又多、又快、又好、又省地发展农业机械化事业方面，找到了一个重要的方向。
    少奇同志随即问站在他身边，工作服上沾满油垢的副站长尹准说：“你是搞机器的，是机械师吗？你们要作些研究。看起来适合这个地方使用的拖拉机，不一定适合丘陵和山区使用。”于是，少奇同志一面用双手比拟着拖拉机的形式，一面详细地描绘出他设想的新型拖拉机应有的特点。他说：“我们应该制造一种小一点的，它工作一天的消耗，只相当于一条牛耕作一天的成本，在路上能运输，能拉几百斤东西，后面也可以挂个犁，能深耕。如果装上一个轮子，像独轮车一样，可以走小路就更好。开机器的人，不一定要坐在上面；机体不要太重，一个人也可以把它扛得走。
    少奇同志的话给大家勾出了一幅清晰的机械化前景，一些过去认为难以实现的事，看来也并不是空想。人们立即兴奋地议论起来。这时，少奇同志又解释似地说：在我国内地，像这里这样的平原有多少呢？山区多，平原少，就需要小一些的机器。
    少奇同志将要离开拖拉机站了。他一次再次地和站上的同志们握手，要他们回去工作。赵京一、尹准等却站在路旁，目送着少奇同志。
    少奇同志离开了。他指示的精神，迅速传到全县每个角落。农民们在三年内实现农业机械化的决心更加坚定，干劲十足。为实现农业机械化的一些准备工作，在全县广泛地展开了。拖拉机站也制订了包括土地整理、改革办站形式、人员培养、水田作业等内容的新的工作规划。他们修改了机耕的收费标准。站内将近半数的拖拉机也已出售给农业社。
