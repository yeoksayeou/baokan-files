    Production and Culture Leap Forward Together
  　Yao Di
    Some comrades engaged in cultural work often complain that production tasks are so busy, why bother with cultural activities? They also complain that the local Party and government do not pay enough attention to cultural activities.
    They want to do their work well, but their shortcoming lies in not fully recognizing the relationship between production and culture, and not understanding the principle that cultural work must serve production.
    Socialist cultural work serves socialist construction. This means that culture must serve production. If cultural work is divorced from the current Great Leap Forward in production, it will inevitably be despised by socialist builders because those cultural activities do not appeal to them. A certain art troupe performed "Chai Tou Feng" during the most intense period of production. As a result, the masses opposed it, and there were very few spectators. Of course, we are not saying that every song, every play, every quick-patter talk should only talk about production; but if most of the songs, most of the plays, most of the quick-patter talks have little to do with production, then are these cultural activities promoting or hindering the current intense socialist construction?
    In some places, during the Great Leap Forward in production, cultural work has also leaped forward. This is mainly because production and culture have been placed in the right positions. With the leap forward in production, cultural work serves it. At present, many rural clubs in various regions closely integrate cultural activities with production, serving production and carrying out cultural activities. Not only that, they also carry out political and ideological education, popular science work, sanitation work, and literacy work. They do all the work that is beneficial to production. Comrades engaged in cultural work there and comrades engaged in local work have no complaints. On the contrary, unified arrangements are made when arranging work. For example, in leading rural cultural work, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, resolutely implemented the principle of serving politics and serving production. The busier production and central work are, the more they use clubs to carry out various activities that have a direct impact on production and central work, which further promotes central work and inspires production enthusiasm.
    Mass cultural work is part of the superstructure. The task of the superstructure is to reflect the economic base and serve the economic base. If the superstructure does not serve the economic base, people will abandon and change this superstructure. The economic base of our country is socialist, and the superstructure must serve socialist economic construction and serve production. Only in this way can it play its due role and be conducive to educating the people and inspiring the people to better complete production and other tasks. The idea that cultural work directly serving production is "forced labor and miscellaneous work," and therefore emphasizing the particularity and independence of cultural work, disregarding the needs of production, and holding too many literary and artistic activities that are not suitable for the needs of the broad masses, is divorced from reality and divorced from the masses. Such cultural work cannot gain the support of the masses, the support of local work comrades, and cannot be developed. Production and culture are inherently complementary. It is not the work itself that is opposed, but the thinking of the workers. County and district local Party and government leaders should be good at guiding those cultural workers who have gone astray, strengthen their leadership over them, and help them to get on the right path, so that culture can leap forward along with the leap forward in production.

### 生产文化齐跃进

    生产文化齐跃进
  　姚堤
    有些作文化工作的同志常常抱怨说，生产任务那么忙，还搞什么文化活动。又抱怨当地的党政不重视文化活动。
    他们想把自己的工作搞好，但是他们的缺点在于没有很好地认识生产同文化的关系，没有认识文化工作必须服务于生产的道理。
    社会主义的文化工作是为社会主义建设服务的。这也就是说文化要为生产服务。文化工作脱离当前的生产大跃进，那就必然为社会主义建设者所鄙弃。因为那些文化活动不对他的心劲。有一个文艺团体在生产最紧张的时候，演出“钗头凤”。结果群众反对，场子上观众很少。当然，我们并不是说每一个歌，每一个剧，每一个快板，都只能谈生产；但是如果大部分的歌，大部分的剧，大部分的快板，与生产关系都不大，那么这些文化活动对当前紧张的社会主义建设到底是促进呢还是促退呢？
    有的地方在生产大跃进中，文化工作也跃进了。这主要是把生产和文化摆对了地方。随着生产的跃进，文化工作为之服务。目前，很多地区的农村俱乐部，就是把文化活动紧密地和生产结合起来，既服务于生产，又开展了文化活动。不但这样，他们还进行了政治思想教育工作，科学普及工作，卫生工作，扫盲工作，只要有利于生产的工作，他们都作。在那里作文化工作的同志，和作地方工作的同志都没有抱怨，相反地，在安排工作的时候，就进行了统一的安排。像山西昔阳县在领导农村文化工作中，就坚决贯彻了为政治为生产服务的方针，生产和中心工作越忙，就越利用俱乐部开展各种对生产和中心工作有直接影响的活动，结果更加推动了中心工作，鼓舞了生产热情。
    群众文化工作是上层建筑的一部分，上层建筑的任务是要反映基础，并且为基础服务的。如果上层建筑不为基础服务，人们就要丢弃、变革这个上层建筑。我们国家的经济基础是社会主义的，上层建筑就必须为社会主义的经济建设服务，为生产服务。只有这样，才能起到它应有的作用，才能有利于教育人民、鼓舞人民更好地完成生产和其它各项任务。那种认为文化工作直接服务于生产就是“拉差打杂”，因而强调文化工作的特殊性和独立性，不顾生产的需要，过多地举办不适合广大群众需要的文艺活动，是脱离实际、脱离群众的。这样的文化工作是得不到群众、得不到地方工作同志的支持，得不到发展的。生产与文化本身是相辅相成的。对立起来的不是工作本身，而是工作者的思想。县、区地方党政领导同志要善于引导那些走上了歧路的文化工作者，加强对他们的领导，帮助他们走到正确的道路上来，从而使文化能随着生产的跃进而跃进。
