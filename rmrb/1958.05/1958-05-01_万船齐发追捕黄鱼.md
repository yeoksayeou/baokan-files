Thousands of Boats Set Sail to Chase Yellow Croaker

    (Our report) Currently, the small yellow croaker shoals have moved north from the Zhoushan fishing grounds to the Lvsi ocean area of Jiangsu Province. More than 100,000 fishermen from Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and other provinces are sailing tens of thousands of fishing boats in Lvsi ocean area to chase them. The small yellow croaker season in the Zhoushan fishing grounds of Zhejiang Province has already produced more than 400,000 dan (approximately 50 kg) of small yellow croaker, and fresh small yellow croaker are being continuously transported to various places to supply the people's food needs.
    This year, more than 180 pairs of motorized junks in Zhoushan, Wenzhou, Ningbo and other special districts of Zhejiang Province went to sea to fish, three times more than in the same period last year. The number of fishermen and fishing boats going to sea is also more than last year. The more than 1,000 experimental boats organized by fishing area cadres have played a role in promoting production. This year, due to the cold climate and strong winds, the small yellow croaker are scattered and thin, and the schools of fish are not easy to find. However, the fishermen have great enthusiasm for production, sail diligently, return to port late, cast more nets, and find schools of fish in a decentralized manner. At the same time, they overcome various difficulties and go to sea to fish even in winds of force six or seven, so the output is not low. Generally, each pair of fishing boats has caught about 10,000 jin (approximately 5 kg), and the high yield has reached about 20,000 jin, and the motorized junks have caught more than 50,000 jin.
    This year, the fish transportation work is also done very well. Thousands of transport ships are constantly transporting boats of fresh small yellow croaker to Shenjiamen, Ningbo, Shanghai and other places, and then transshipped to coastal cities for consumption. Thanks to the transportation workers doing everything possible to use their brains, it used to take 24 hours to transport from Lvsi ocean area to Shanghai, but now it only takes 18 hours. (Cheng Min)
    (Our report) In recent days, in the coastal fishing grounds of the Liaodong Peninsula, hundreds of fishing boats have been busy day and night casting nets and fishing. This spring, the yellow croaker schools migrated north along the seabed as usual. The fishing boats set sail upon hearing the news to encircle and hunt the schools of fish, forming the annual spring fishing season.
    The vast number of fishermen in the Liaodong Peninsula are striving to catch 300,000 tons of aquatic products in this year's leap forward plan, an increase of 60% over the actual output last year.

    万船齐发追捕黄鱼
    本报讯　目前小黄鱼群已从舟山渔场北上到江苏省的吕泗洋，浙江、江苏、福建等省十多万渔民驾着几万只渔船正在吕泗洋追捕。浙江省舟山渔场的小黄鱼汛已产小黄鱼四十多万担，新鲜的小黄鱼正源源运往各地供应人民食用。
    今年浙江省舟山、温州、宁波等专区有一百八十多对机帆船下海捕鱼，比去年同时期增加三倍；出海的渔民鱼船也比去年多，渔区干部搞的一千多只试验船，在生产中起了推动作用。今年由于气候冷，大风多，小黄鱼发得散，发得薄，鱼群不容易找到。但是渔民们生产干劲大，勤开洋，晚回港，多下网，分散找鱼群，同时克服了各种困难，在六、七级大风中也出海捕鱼，因此产量并不低。一般每对渔船已捕一万斤左右，产量高的达到两万斤左右，机帆船高的捕了五万多斤。
    今年鱼货运输工作也做得很好，几千只运输船川流不息的把一船船新鲜小黄鱼运到沈家门、宁波、上海等地，再转运到沿海各城市供应食用。由于运输工人千方百计的开动脑子，原来从吕泗洋到上海需要二十四小时，现在只要十八小时就运到了。　（程敏）
    本报讯　连日来，辽东半岛沿海的渔场，成百上千只渔船日夜忙着撒网捕鱼。今年春天，黄花鱼群按照旧例在海底回游北上，渔船闻讯齐放，围捕鱼群，形成一年一度的春海市。
    辽东半岛广大渔民今年跃进规划争取捕捞水产品三十万吨，比去年实际产量要增加60％。
