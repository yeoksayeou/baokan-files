    From Orchids to Carnivorous Plants
    Zhou Jianren
    Both Zhejiang and Fujian provinces produce orchids, but the species are quite different. The orchids from Fujian are called Jianlan orchids, with darker leaves that are smoother and slightly leathery. The Jianlan orchids I've seen all have nine segments. I haven't seen any plum blossom or narcissus varieties. They generally bloom later.
    The orchids produced in Zhejiang province include spring orchids and summer orchids. Spring orchids are also called grass orchids or single-leaf orchids. One stem bears one flower (or two flowers, but very rarely); the leaves are relatively soft and short. Summer orchids are also called nine-segment orchids or Hui orchids, with one stem bearing seven, eight, or more than ten flowers. The spring orchids have already finished blooming. The summer orchids are just beginning to bloom.
    The orchid is the plant in the monocotyledon family with the most uniquely shaped flowers. No, or even including dicotyledonous plants, it can be said that way. Its six petals are divided into inner and outer layers, similar to other monocotyledonous plants, but among the three inner petals, the two that are symmetrical on the left and right face forward and are called "cups" in orchid nomenclature. The downward-facing petal is called the "tongue," shaped like a tongue, and curls downward. This refers to the position when the flower is fully open; when unopened, the tongue is at the top, growing towards the flower stem (nine-segment orchids).
    The tongue of the orchid is white, with green, or slightly yellow, and usually has red spots. Some are bright red, others are purplish. Those without red spots on the tongue are called plain orchids or orchid-heart orchids. Plants with red flowers often also have white-flowered varieties, but they are less common. For example, milk vetch (i.e., purple cloud British), pomegranates, etc., all have white-flowered varieties. Water buffaloes are generally black. There are also completely white ones. Chinese chickens also have pure white ones. People lacking pigment are called albinos. Albinos are not considered particularly noble, nor are white cattle, but white plain orchids are considered "more precious." Orchid growers consider plum blossom and narcissus petals even more precious.
    Also worth mentioning is that between the two cups of the orchid is a short column, called the "nose" in orchid nomenclature. It is the fusion of the pistil and stamen. The pollen masses grow at the top. Below is the style. After pollination, the flower stalk swells and enlarges, forming a fruit, commonly called orchid seeds.
    When the summer orchid flower is about to bloom, a small amount of nectar is secreted below the bract of the flower stalk (each flower stalk has a narrow bract at its base). Botanists call flowers that produce a lot of pollen "pollen flowers," and flowers that produce nectar "nectar flowers." Nectar is useful for plants. When insects come to collect nectar, they easily carry the pollen to the pistils of other flowers, making it easier to achieve pollination and fruiting. However, the nectar of the nine-segment orchid is produced outside the flower, at the base of the bracts, so it is not clear how insects carry the pollen when collecting nectar.
    Orchids have a fragrance, and many people like them. Recently, a flower exhibition was held in the building next to Yue Fei's Tomb in Hangzhou, with a large orchid room showcasing many orchids, including many plum blossom and lotus petal varieties (spring orchids).
    However, not all flowers in the orchid family are fragrant. Some flower shapes have also become very special. For example, there is the "dog basket flower" in the Northeast, which is a plant in the orchid family that grows even more peculiarly. These kinds of flowers, called "lady's slippers" in the West (translated meaning), are also cultivated for ornamental purposes because of their unique flower shape.
    When talking about orchids, its roots should not be forgotten. They are plump, shaped like fingers. White when young, later turning yellow. If you cut a thin slice and look at it under a microscope, you can see strands of things scattered in the cells of the root. This is a type of fungus.
    The growth of fungi in the roots of orchids is clearly beneficial. Because there are water and other substances to be obtained there. But is it also beneficial for orchids? According to botanists, orchid root cells sometimes digest hyphae for nutrition. Therefore, in the plant world, there are not only carnivorous plants, but also plants that contain fungi.
    Since carnivorous plants are mentioned, a few words must be added here. In the mountains of Shaoxing, there are often small, light green plants growing under trees, about several inches high. Its leaves are crescent-shaped, with glandular hairs. The glandular hairs can secrete mucus. If a small insect lands on the leaf, the glandular hairs curl inward and trap the insect. The insect's body is gradually digested as nutrition. When the easily digestible parts are digested, only hard parts such as wings are left, and the glandular hairs unfold as before. Because the glandular hairs of this plant can secrete mucus, it is called sundew.
    There are many types of carnivorous plants, and some of the more familiar names are sundew, Venus flytrap, and pitcher plant, etc. The method of sundew capturing small insects is like sundew. The leaves of the Venus flytrap can fold together and trap small insects inside. The leaves and petioles of the pitcher plant become bottle-shaped, with a small piece on top, like a lid lifted open. There is liquid in the bottle, and if small insects fall in, they drown. I heard that this plant is produced in Guangdong. I saw it being cultivated in the Beijing Botanical Garden last year.

    从兰花谈到食虫植物
    周建人
    浙江与福建都出产兰花，但种类大不相同。福建产的兰花叫建兰，叶色较深，较平滑，略呈革质状。我见到的一些建兰都是九节的。也没有见到梅瓣，水仙等品种。它们一般开花较迟。
    浙江产的兰花有春兰和夏兰。春兰亦叫草兰或单叶兰。一干一花（亦有二花的，但很少见）；叶比较柔软而短。夏兰又叫九节兰或蕙兰，一干七、八花或十余朵。现在春兰已谢了。夏兰正在开始开放。
    兰花是单子叶植物里花形变化得最特别的植物。不，或者包括双子叶植物在内也可以这样说。它的六片花被分作内外两层，与其他单子叶植物相似，但内层的三瓣里，左右对称的两瓣是向前的，兰谱上称为“捧。”向下的一瓣称为“舌”，呈舌头的形状，向下卷屈。这是指花正开时的位置而说的，未开时，舌在上方，即向花干生着（九节兰）。
    兰花的舌呈白色，带绿色，或微带黄，普通有红色斑点。有的红色鲜明，有的带紫色。舌上没有红点的称为素兰或兰心兰。开红花的植物，常常又有开白花的，不过少见些。例如草子（即紫云英），石榴，等等，都有开白花的。水牛一般呈黑色。亦有全白的。中国鸡也有纯白色的。人里色素缺乏的叫杨白人。杨白人并不被看作特别高贵，白牛也是这样，但白色的素兰则被看作“贵重”些。被种兰花者看作更珍贵的还有梅瓣及水仙等等。
    还有须要提到的，兰花的两捧中间有一个短柱，兰谱上叫做“鼻”。它是雌雄蕊的合体。顶端生着花粉块。下方就是花柱。受粉后，花柄部分并胀大起来，结成果实，俗叫兰荪。
    夏兰的花将开时，花柄的苞叶下方分泌出一点花蜜（每一花柄基部生一片狭长苞叶）。植物学者叫产花粉很多的花为“花粉花”，产花蜜的花为“花蜜花”。花蜜对于植物有用处。昆虫来采蜜时，容易把花粉带到他花的雌蕊上去，容易获得受粉与结子。但九节兰的花蜜产在花外面，苞片的基部，昆虫来采蜜时怎么把花粉带去的还不大清楚。
    兰花有芳香，许多人喜欢它。最近杭州岳坟的庙旁房子里开了花卉展览会，独辟一大间兰室，陈列着许许多多兰花，不少梅瓣及荷瓣（春兰）。
    但兰科植物的花并不是全都有香气。有的花形也变得很特别。例如东北有“狗篮子花”，便是长得更特别的兰科里的植物。这类花，西洋叫“夫人的拖鞋”（译意），因花形很奇特，也栽培了供观赏用的。
    讲到兰花时，它的根是不应该忘记不讲的。它是胖胖的，像指头的形状。嫩时白色，后来带黄色。你如果切一片薄片，放在显微镜下看，能看见根里细胞里有一条条的东西散布着。这是一种菌类植物。
    菌类生长在兰花的根里显然是有利的。因为那里有水份等物质可得。但是对于兰花是否也有利呢？据植物学者说，兰花根的细胞有时在消化菌丝供营养之用。因此，植物界中不但有食虫植物，还有含菌植物这名称存在。
    既提到食虫植物，这里不得不附带说几句。绍兴山中树下常有嫩绿色的小植物生着，约莫数寸高。它的叶呈半月形，生着腺毛。腺毛能分泌出粘液。如有小虫停立叶上，腺毛即向里卷屈，把虫缠住。虫身就被渐渐消化掉作为营养。到了容易消化的部分消化掉后，只剩下翅膀等坚硬部分时，腺毛又展开如前了。因这种植物的腺毛能分泌粘液，所以名叫它毛膏菜。
    食虫植物种类很多，名字比较熟识的有毛毡苔，捕蝇草，猪笼草等等。毛毡苔捕食小虫的方法像毛膏菜。捕蝇草的叶子能对折拢，能把小虫合在里面。猪笼草的叶子和叶柄部分变成瓶子的形状，上方有一个小片，像盖子掀开着的样子。瓶子里有水液，小虫如跌进去，便淹死。听说广东生产这植物。去年看到北京植物园里也有栽培着。
