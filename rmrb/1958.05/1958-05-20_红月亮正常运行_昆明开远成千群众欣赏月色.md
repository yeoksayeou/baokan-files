Xinhua News Agency, May 19th, dispatch: TASS, Moscow dispatch: As of 6:00 AM Moscow time on May 19th, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite and its carrier rocket had orbited the Earth fifty times. Optical stations in the southern regions of the Soviet Union observed the satellite and carrier rocket during the evenings of May 17th and 18th. Optical and radio-technical observations have confirmed that the satellite and carrier rocket are currently operating in different orbits within the same plane. The carrier rocket is operating at a lower altitude than the satellite and is slightly ahead. On May 19th, the carrier rocket was seven minutes ahead of the satellite in terms of time. This lead time will gradually increase in the future. The measuring instruments installed on the satellite are continuously transmitting information regarding scientific observations to various recording stations on the ground. The programming device on the satellite is operating stably and ensuring the automatic function of all instruments.

Currently, the materials from scientific observations and measurements are being studied. In clear, cloudless weather, the third artificial satellite and its carrier rocket can be observed with the naked eye after sunset in regions between 2 degrees and 34 degrees North latitude, and before sunrise in regions between 49 degrees and 65 degrees South latitude.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 19th: On the evening of May 18th, people in Kunming and Kaiyuan observed the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite with the naked eye. The satellite flew from northwest to southeast, and its brightness was much greater than that of the second satellite. In Kaiyuan, more than two thousand people and members of the stationed military observed the third artificial satellite passing overhead at 20:56. In Kunming, personnel from Kunming No. 7 Middle School, Kunming Traditional Chinese Medicine Continuing Education School, and a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, among others, also observed the bright third artificial satellite slowly passing overhead around 21:00.

　　红月亮正常运行
    昆明开远成千群众欣赏月色
    据新华社19日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：到5月19日莫斯科时间六时正为止，苏联第三个人造卫星及其运载火箭已经绕地球转了五十圈。苏联南部地区的光学站在5月17日和18日傍晚看到了卫星和运载火箭。光学和无线电技术观测的结果证明，现在卫星和运载火箭正在同一平面的不同轨道上运行。运载火箭的运行低于卫星，并略略领先。5月19日运载火箭就时间来说已比卫星领先七分钟。领先的时间今后将逐渐增加。装置在卫星上的测量仪器经常不断地向地面上各记录站发送科学观测结果的情报。卫星上的程序装置正在稳定地工作，并且保证全部仪器的自动机能。
    现在正对科学观测和测量结果的材料进行研究。晴天无云时，北纬二度到三十四度之间地区在日落以后，南纬四十九度到六十五度之间地区在日出以前，可以用肉眼看到第三个人造卫星和它的运载火箭。
    新华社昆明19日电　昆明、开远人民18日晚上，用肉眼看到了苏联第三个人造地球卫星。卫星从西北向东南飞行，光度比第二个卫星亮得多。开远人民和驻军，有二千多人在二十点五十六分看到第三个人造卫星从头顶飞过。在昆明，昆明七中、昆明中医进修学校和解放军某部官兵等也都在二十一点前后看到了明亮的第三个人造卫星从头顶缓缓飞过。
