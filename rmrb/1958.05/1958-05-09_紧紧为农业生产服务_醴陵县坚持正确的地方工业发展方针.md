This newspaper reported from Changsha on May 8th: Liling County, Hunan Province, has rapidly and effectively developed local industry to serve agricultural production and has achieved great results. From January to late April of this year, according to incomplete statistics, 1,988 small factories and mines have been established, with an average of 15 new factories and mines appearing every day.

Of the factories and mines already built in Liling County, 95% directly serve agricultural production, including factories and mines producing bacterial and granular fertilizers, manufacturing and repairing agricultural tools, mining coal, and processing rice and tea using water and animal power. These factories and mines come in various forms, including those run by the county, the township, jointly by the county and township, by the commune, or jointly by the township and commune.

The common characteristic of these factories and mines is that they are built and put into production simultaneously, closely focusing on all current aspects of agricultural production to provide services. For example, during the spring plowing season, the newly built ten joint factories and eighty-one small and medium-sized agricultural tool repair stations used ancestral halls and temples as workshops and water pump generators for power. In just over a month, more than 25,000 old plows were converted into new-style paddy field plows. Double-wheeled double-shared plows and all cultivators and row markers were also modified according to new technical conditions. The original double-wheeled double-shared plows required two oxen to pull, but after modification, only one ox was needed, and the work efficiency was also doubled. In addition, 43 new types of vehicles, agricultural tools, and tea rolling machines were created, totaling more than 86,000 pieces. Each agricultural cooperative also established more than 1,000 granular and bacterial fertilizer plants, and to date, more than 220,000 catties of granular fertilizer and bacterial fertilizer have been produced. At the same time, they also erected 326 aerial fertilizer transport cableways and built more than 2,200 kilometers of simple roads and cart roads. In this way, the difficulties of tool and labor shortages (estimated at 14 million workdays) that arose during the great leap in agriculture were basically resolved, strongly supporting spring plowing production. Now, in the county, heavy farm work has been changed from shoulder carrying to vehicle transport, increasing efficiency by four or five times and enabling the timely transport of nearly 1 billion dan of fertilizer to the fields. Currently, the county is actively preparing to establish native fertilizer, lime, sugar refining, and wine-making factories to prepare fertilizer for late rice. After the wheat harvest, they will use wheat straw and rice straw to make wine in large quantities, saving grain for the country, and also use distillers' grains to feed pigs to solve the difficulty of pig feed in rural areas.

The main experience of Liling County in achieving rapid, effective, and economical local industrial development is, first of all, the entire party is mobilized, the secretary takes command, grasping both agriculture and industry with both hands, and assigning dedicated personnel at all levels to be responsible for unified leadership. Secondly, it is necessary to resolutely implement the correct policy of relying on the masses, focusing on small-scale projects, making do with whatever is available, using local materials, starting from scratch, growing from small to large, and closely serving agricultural production. On this issue, Liling County also had two different approaches. One was not to start from the current reality, mainly relying on the state for money and machinery. For example, the Guanzhuang Joint Factory built a hydropower station in November last year, investing 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and is still calling for insufficient funds and cannot be completed and generate electricity immediately. The other is to make do with whatever is available and start with small-scale projects. For example, the Pukou Joint Factory, without power, used a water pump generator to immediately put into production and created a batch of new tools to meet the needs of spring plowing, which was welcomed by the masses. Nanchiao Township spent only more than ten yuan to build eleven small coal kilns in fifteen days, enabling farmers throughout the township to switch from burning firewood to burning coal, saving a lot of household labor such as firewood chopping and solving the difficulty of insufficient labor for agricultural production. Liling County criticized the former approach and adopted the latter approach, so that local industry could develop rapidly in a short period of time. Of the more than 1,900 factories and mines established throughout the county, almost no new factory buildings were built; most of the funds were also raised by the masses themselves.

    紧紧为农业生产服务
    醴陵县坚持正确的地方工业发展方针
    本报长沙8日电　湖南省醴陵县多快好省地发展地方工业为农业生产服务，已经取得了很大成绩。从今年1月到4月下旬，据不完全统计，已办了一千九百八十八个小型厂、矿，平均每天有十五个新的厂矿出现。
    醴陵县已建成的厂矿中，95％是直接为农业生产服务的，有细菌，颗粒肥料、农具制造修配、采煤和水力畜力碾米、茶叶加工等厂矿。这些厂矿的形式多种多样，有县办、乡办、县乡合办，也有社办、乡社合办的。
    这些厂矿的共同特点是一面建厂一面生产，紧密围绕着当前农业的各个生产环节，为生产服务。例如在春耕时，新建的十个联合工厂和八十一个中小型农具修配站，就是利用祠堂庙宇做车间和抽水机发电做动力干起活来的。一个多月内把二万五千多部旧犁改为新式水田犁；双轮双铧犁和全部中耕器、划行器也都根据新的技术条件改装了。原来的双轮双铧犁要两头牛拉，改装后只用一头牛，工效还提高一倍。另外还创制了各种新式车子、农具和揉茶机四十三种共八万六千多件。各农业社也自办起一千多个颗粒、细菌肥料厂，到现在已出产颗粒肥料和细菌肥料二十二万余斤。同时，他们还架了三百二十六条高空运肥索道，兴修简易公路和大车路二千二百多公里。这样，农业大跃进中出现的工具和劳力不足（估计缺一千四百万个劳动日）的困难就基本上得到了解决，有力地支援了春耕生产。现在，全县笨重的农活都已改肩挑为车运，工效提高四、五倍，把近十亿担肥料及时运送到田里。目前，这个县正积极筹办土化肥、石灰、制糖、酿酒等工厂，为晚稻准备肥料，麦收后即大量利用麦秆、稻草酿酒，为国家节约粮食，还利用酒糟酪喂猪，以解决农村猪饲料的困难。
    醴陵县地方工业能够做到多快好省的主要经验，首先是全党动手，书记挂帅，一手抓农业，一手抓工业，层层指定专人负责，统一领导。其次是坚决贯彻依靠群众，以小型为主，因陋就简，就地取材，从无到有，从小到大，紧密为农业生产服务的正确方针。在这个问题上，醴陵县也曾有过两种不同的做法，一种是不从当前实际出发，主要靠国家拿钱拿机器。如官庄联合工厂去年11月间办了个水电站，已投资两、三万元，现在还喊资金不足，不能立即建成发电。另一种是因陋就简，先搞小的，如浦口联合工厂没有动力就利用抽水机发电立即投入生产，创制一批新工具满足春耕需要，受到群众欢迎。南桥乡只花十多元在十五天内办了十一个小煤窑，使全乡农户改烧柴为烧煤，节省大量砍柴等家务劳动，解决了农业生产劳力不足的困难。醴陵县批判前一种作法，采取后一种作法，地方工业才能在短时期内迅速发展起来。全县兴办的一千九百多个厂矿，几乎没有新建一个厂房；资金也是大部分依靠群众自筹解决。
