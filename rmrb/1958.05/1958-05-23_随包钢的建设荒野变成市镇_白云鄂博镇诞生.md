    Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, May 22nd. Baiyun'ebo Town, located on the grassland north of the Yin Mountains in western Inner Mongolia, was officially established on the 18th.
    This town has grown with the construction of Baogang's ore supply base – the Baiyun'ebo Iron Mine. A few years ago, the wild grasslands where prospectors pitched their tents have now become bustling streets and construction sites, with newly built buildings covering an area of more than 40,000 square meters. The town currently has a population of nearly 10,000 people, who are workers and their families of Han, Mongolian, Daur, Hui, Korean, and other ethnic groups from all over the country. This emerging town is connected to Baotou City, 300 miles away, by railway; and cars can travel from here to all parts of the grassland.
    At the first session of the first People's Congress of Baiyun'ebo Town held from May 18th to 20th, it was announced that Baiyun'ebo Town was officially established in accordance with the decision of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. More than 60 representatives of various ethnic groups discussed the work of the new town. They decided to build seven local small factories this year, including a cement factory, a machinery repair factory, and a milk processing factory, to support the great leap forward in nearby animal husbandry production, and to serve the lives of miners and herdsmen. At the meeting, the Town People's Committee was elected, and Bayandulrong (Mongolian), the current Deputy Secretary of the Town Party Committee who has worked in this grassland area for more than ten years, was elected as the town mayor. During the meeting, Ulanqab League and Darhan Muminggan United Banner sent representatives and telegrams to congratulate the birth of this new town.

    随包钢的建设荒野变成市镇
    白云鄂博镇诞生
    新华社呼和浩特22日电　内蒙古西部阴山以北草原上的白云鄂博镇18日正式诞生。
    这个市镇是随着包钢的矿石供应基地——白云鄂博铁矿山的建设而成长起来的。几年前勘探人员搭过帐篷的荒草野地，现在已经成了热闹的街市和建设场地，新建的房屋面积共有四万多平方公尺。这个市镇现有人口近一万人，他们是来自祖国各地的汉、蒙古、达斡尔、回、朝鲜等民族的职工和家属。这个新兴的市镇有铁路同三百里外的包头市相接；汽车可以从这儿通往草原各处。
    5月18日到20日举行的白云鄂博镇第一届人民代表大会第一次会议上，按照内蒙古自治区人民委员会的决定，宣布了白云鄂博镇正式成立。六十多名各族代表讨论了新市镇的工作，他们确定今年兴建水泥厂、机械修配厂、牛奶加工厂等七座地方小型工厂，支援附近牧业生产大跃进，并为矿山职工和牧民生活服务。会上选举产生了镇人民委员会，在这一带草原上工作了十多年的现任中共镇委副书记巴彦都荣（蒙古族）被选为镇长。会议期间，乌兰察布盟和达尔罕茂明安联合旗曾分别派人和打电报祝贺这个新市镇的诞生。
