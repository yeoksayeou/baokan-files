　　Working Methods Must Adapt to the New Situation
　　Jiang Xia
    Whether our work can be done well depends importantly on whether we can grasp the new situation and whether our working methods are adapted to the new situation.
    A new situation inevitably brings new changes and new requirements. Taking rural commercial work as an example, due to the unprecedented busyness of agricultural production after the Great Leap Forward and the shortage of labor, farmers have very little time to go to market as they did in the past, but their purchase and sale demands have not decreased as a result, but have instead increased. Under this new situation, farmers (agricultural cooperatives) urgently hope to supply more and better means of production and livelihood, and hope to buy and sell without leaving the village, saving labor. In this way, the original organizational forms and working methods of rural commercial departments appear to be unsuited or not fully suited to the needs of the new situation. The new issue of extending commercial networks to agricultural cooperatives has been brought before us. If this problem is not solved, work cannot move forward. Working methods lagging behind the situation actually reflect our thinking lagging behind objective reality. To make work adapt to the situation, we must first have our thinking catch up with the situation, dare to break with convention, and dare to boldly innovate. Today, this newspaper publishes the example of the Hujia Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative, which, with a spirit of bold innovation, extended its commercial network to agricultural cooperatives, which not only greatly facilitated mass purchases and sales and expanded business, but also saved farmers a large number of workdays, directly and indirectly supporting production. The reason they did so well is because they grasped the new situation and dared to break with convention to strive to adapt their work to this situation.
    After the Hujia Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative extended its commercial network, it became easier for cadres to understand the needs of the masses and to combine business with production, so they were able to both facilitate commerce and understand agriculture, and think about production everywhere. This enables the cadres' thinking to quickly keep up with reality and make their understanding conform to objective reality.
    The new situation of the agricultural production high tide puts forward new requirements for commercial work, and will inevitably put forward new requirements for handicrafts, postal and telecommunications, banks, service industries, and other related departments. These departments should also seriously consider how to grasp the current new situation and strive to adapt to it.

### 工作方法一定要适应新形势

　　工作方法一定要适应新形势
　　江夏
    我们的工作能不能做得好，很重要的一条是要看我们能不能捉住新的形势，看我们的工作方法是不是适应新的形势。
    新的形势必然带来新的变化和新的要求。以农村商业工作为例，由于农业大跃进后生产空前繁忙，劳动力紧张，农民很少有时间像过去一样去赶集了，但他们的购销要求却并不因此而减少，相反的更增多了。在这种新的情况下面，农民（农业社）迫切希望供应更多更好的生产、生活资料，希望买、卖不出村，节省劳动力。这样，农村商业部门原有的组织形式和工作方法，就显得不适应或不完全适应新形势的需要了。商业网下伸到农业社的新问题就提到我们的面前了。不解决这个问题，工作就不能前进。工作方法落后于形势，实际上是反映了我们的思想落后于客观实际。要想使工作适应形势，首先必须要思想赶上形势，敢于打破常规，敢于大胆革新。今天本报发表的胡家镇供销社以大胆革新的精神，把商业网下伸到农业社，不但大大便利了群众购销，扩大了业务，而且节省了农民大量劳动日，直接和间接地支持了生产。他们所以做得好，就是因为他们捉住了新的形势，并且敢于打破常规努力使自己的工作适应这一形势。
    胡家镇供销社在商业网下伸以后，干部比过去便于了解群众的需要，便于把业务同生产结合起来，因而他们能够做到既通商又通农，处处为生产着想。这就使干部的思想能很快地跟上实际，使自己的认识符合于客观实际。
    农业生产高潮的新形势，向商业工作提出了新要求，同时也必然会向手工业、邮电、银行、服务业以及其它有关部门提出新要求，这些部门也应当认真考虑怎样去捉住当前的新形势，并努力去适应它。
