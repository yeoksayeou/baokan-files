    Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 25th. The 696-kilometer-long roadbed, bridge, culvert, and tunnel projects for the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway, from Hongliuhe on the Xinjiang border to the Tianshan (Dabancheng) section where the transverse railway is advancing westward, have been fully launched. More than 10,000 laborers have put forward the heroic slogan of "Crossing the Tianshan Mountains in one year and reaching the border in two years," launching a full-scale offensive against the Gobi Desert and the Tianshan Mountains along the route.

    After the roadbed project of the Hongliuhe to Hami section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway in Xinjiang started in March, in April and May, a large labor force, including a portion of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, successively entered the line from west of Hami to the Dabancheng section. The mechanical road construction team, transportation team, water supply team, construction team, wiring team, and material factory, water pipe factory, and other units affiliated with the First Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways have also started work at construction sites along the route. On the more than 600-kilometer-long barren Gobi Desert line, magnificent road construction scenes can be seen in most sections. At present, most of the roadbed project for the Hongliuhe to Hami section has been completed, the Hongliuhe Bridge has begun its pier construction, and the bridge construction workers are guaranteeing to complete the main structure of the entire bridge twenty days ahead of schedule in mid-June. Due to the soaring enthusiasm of the road construction workers, the original leap forward plan to open to traffic to Hami in October will be realized ahead of schedule in August.

    Thousands of workers engaged in the key project of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway—the Dabancheng Tianshan Tunnel Group—are currently fighting the rocks day and night on the Tianshan construction site amidst towering mountains. They are tasked with excavating twelve tunnels with a total length of 4.5 kilometers, ensuring that they will be opened up by "May Day" next year.

    向戈壁和天山全面进攻
    兰新铁路红柳河——天山段开工
    新华社乌鲁木齐25日电　兰新铁路从新疆边境红柳河到横断铁路西进的天山（达坂城）段，六百九十六公里长的线路路基和桥涵、隧道工程，已经全面动工建设。一万多人的劳动大军提出“一年跨天山、两年通国境”的英雄口号，向沿线戈壁和天山发起全面进攻。
    兰新铁路新疆境内红柳河至哈密段的路基工程在3月份动工后，4、5月份，包括新疆生产建设兵团一部分人在内的劳动大军，陆续进入哈密以西至达坂城段的线路上。铁道部第一工程局所属机械筑路队、运输队、供水队、基建队、架线队和材料厂、制水管厂等单位，也在沿线工地展开工作。在六百多公里长荒漠的戈壁线路上，大部分地段已可以看到壮阔的筑路景象，目前红柳河至哈密段的路基工程已完成大半，红柳河大桥已起墩，建桥工人们保证提前二十天在6月中旬完成全桥主体工程。由于筑路职工干劲冲天，原定10月通车哈密的跃进计划，将被提前在8月实现。
    修筑兰新铁路关键工程——达坂城天山隧道群的几千名职工，目前正在重重峻岭的天山工地上夜以继日地向岩石搏斗。他们要开凿十二条总长四点五公里的隧道，保证要在明年“五一”打通天山。
