Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 24th. Anshan Iron and Steel Company has recently successfully tested twelve new technologies of great significance. The promotion of these new technologies, which are spread across important production departments such as iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, ore dressing, and refractory materials, provides a guarantee for a comprehensive leap forward in Anshan Iron and Steel's production.

The new technologies successfully tested in open-hearth steelmaking, such as shortening the pure boiling time, four-ladle tapping, and deoxidation in the ladle, have greatly increased steel production and saved raw materials. Pure boiling is a process in steelmaking that Anshan Iron and Steel's steelmaking workers have successfully developed after repeated research and experimentation. Promoting this new technology can increase steel production by about 4%. The new technology of four-ladle tapping was successfully tested at the No. 7 open-hearth furnace in the First Steelmaking Plant at the end of March. Due to the increased number of tapping ladles, the steel output of this open-hearth furnace in April increased by 30% compared to March. Mastering the technology of deoxidation in the ladle allows Anshan Iron and Steel to save over one million yuan worth of deoxidizing materials such as silicomanganese each year.

The widespread use of high-strength, low-alloy steel in industrial construction is a metal-saving direction that industrialized countries universally emphasize. Anshan Iron and Steel has recently successfully smelted a widely applicable manganese-silicon low-alloy steel using a large open-hearth furnace. Replacing ordinary carbon steel with this type of steel in the manufacture of vehicles or as a building structure can save about 20% of steel.

The new high-pressure furnace top technology recently successfully tested at the No. 3 blast furnace of the Iron Smelting Plant has a significant effect on ensuring smooth operation of the blast furnace and increasing pig iron production. After adopting high-pressure furnace top operation, the average utilization coefficient of this blast furnace reached 0.603 in April, increasing pig iron production by more than 4,000 tons. It has transformed from a backward blast furnace that frequently failed to meet its plans to the most advanced blast furnace in the entire plant.

Recently, Anshan Iron and Steel used nodular cast iron rolls to replace imported forged steel rolls on the 1,150 mm diameter primary rolling mill. The price of nodular cast iron rolls is only one-eighteenth of that of imported forged steel rolls.

    鞍钢试成十二项新技术
    据新华社鞍山24日电　鞍山钢铁公司最近试验成功了十二项有重大意义的新技术。这些遍布在炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、选矿、耐火材料等重要生产部门的新技术的推广，为鞍钢生产全面大跃进提供了保证。
    在炼钢平炉上试验成功的缩短纯沸腾时间、四罐出钢、罐内脱氧等新技术，大大增加了钢的产量，节约了原材料。纯沸腾是炼钢的一个过程，是鞍钢的炼钢工作者在经过反复研究试验成功的。推广这项新技术能增产钢4％左右。四罐出钢的新技术，是3月底在第一炼钢厂七号平炉上试验成功的。由于增加了出钢罐，这个平炉4月份的钢产量比3月份增加了30％。罐内脱氧技术的掌握，使鞍钢每年可以节约价值一百多万元的矽锰等脱氧材料。
    工业建筑中广泛采用高强度低合金钢，是工业发达的国家一致重视的节约金属的方向。鞍钢最近利用大型平炉冶炼成功了一种能普遍应用的含锰矽的低合金钢。以这种钢代替一般的炭素钢制造车辆或作建筑结构，能节约钢材20％左右。
    炼铁厂三号高炉最近试验成功的高压炉顶新技术，对保证高炉顺行、增产生铁有很大的作用。这个高炉采用高压炉顶操作以后，四月份平均利用系数达到○·六○三，增产了四千多吨生铁，由原来经常完不成计划的落后高炉一跃而成为全厂最先进的高炉。
    最近鞍钢在直径一千一百五十公厘的初轧机上使用球墨铸铁轧辊代替了进口锻钢轧辊。球墨铸铁轧辊的价格只有进口的锻钢轧辊的十八分之一。
