From our correspondent in Hefei, May 30th: Since February of this year, the Feidong County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Anhui Province has been simultaneously grasping industry and agriculture. The county has already built and put into production 304 small factories and mines, and more than 7,000 granular fertilizer plants run by agricultural cooperatives. Feidong County originally had only eight small factories and more than eighty handicraft cooperatives (groups). Last year, the industrial output value accounted for only 18.7% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. This year, it will increase to 45.2%. The county's demand for iron can be met by its own indigenous mining methods. Many agricultural tools can be repaired and manufactured by themselves. The county has built more than 5,000 culverts and sluice gates for reservoirs. The 9,000 tons of cement needed this year can also be self-sufficient.

The great leap forward in agricultural production in Feidong County has placed many new demands on local industry. Last year, the county had only four double-wheeled double-shared plows, but this year the masses are demanding the supply of 900 plows. To build water conservancy projects, cement is needed to build sluice gates and culverts. The planting area of ​​Dai-character cotton has nearly doubled compared with last year, but the supply of fertilizer and sprayers cannot keep up. Just as this contradiction became increasingly acute, the Provincial Party Committee put forward the call for every county to run industries, every township to run industries, and every department to run industries in conjunction with their business. The County Party Committee immediately shifted part of its leadership to industry. The County Party Committee formed an industrial and agricultural leap forward leading group headed by the Second Secretary Jiang Ke, and established an industrial leap forward office to lead specific businesses. Each district and township has a secretary in charge of industry. When the county and township study agricultural plans, they also study industrial plans. The County Party Committee mobilized various departments to contribute people and funds to run industries, and sent a group of capable cadres to run industries. The person in charge of the County Party Committee and the Minister of Industry and Transportation also ran all over the mountainous areas to find mines, and led cadres and the masses to think of various ways to develop industry, truly achieving "the secretary takes charge, the whole party runs industry, and the whole people run industry."

In order to overcome the difficulty of not being able to buy equipment, they first run manual industries, and then gradually realize mechanization. Because the newly built factories are all serving agriculture, they have won the support and assistance of the broad masses. The investment of various departments, agricultural cooperatives and the broad masses has reached more than 16 million yuan, and various departments and agricultural cooperatives have voluntarily given up more than 18,000 old houses.

### 肥东县书记动手办工业  全县乡社已建厂矿七千多

    肥东县书记动手办工业
    全县乡社已建厂矿七千多
    本报合肥30日电　中共安徽省肥东县委从今年2月开始一手抓工业、一手抓农业，全县已经建成并已投入生产的小型厂矿有三百零四个，农业社办的颗粒肥料厂七千多个。肥东县原来只有八个小型工厂和八十多个手工业社（组），去年工业产值只占工农业产值的18.7％，今年将增长到45.2％，全县需要的铁，自己用土法开采可以得到满足。许多农具都能自己修配自己制造。全县修建水库涵管和水闸五千多处，需水泥九千吨，今年也可以自给了。
    肥东县的农业生产大跃进，对地方工业提出了许多新的要求。去年全县只有四部双轮双铧犁，而今年群众却要求供应九百部。要兴修水利，但没有水泥修建水闸和涵管。岱字棉的种植面积比去年扩大近一倍，但是肥料和喷雾器供应不上。正在这一矛盾越来越尖锐的时候，省委提出了县县办工业，乡乡办工业，各部门结合业务办工业的号召。县委立即把一部分领导力量转向工业。县委以第二书记姜克为首组成了工农业跃进领导小组，并成立了工业跃进办公室，领导具体业务。各区、乡都有一个书记专管工业。县里、乡里研究农业规划的时候，也研究工业规划。县委动员各部门献人献资金办工业，并派一批得力的干部去办工业。县委负责人和工业交通部部长还跑遍山区找矿，带动干部和群众想各种办法发展工业，真正做到了“书记动手，全党办工业，全民办工业。”
    为了克服买不到设备的困难，他们先办手工操作的工业，然后逐步实现机械化。由于新建的工厂都是为农业服务的，得到了广大群众的拥护和支援。各部门、农业社和广大群众的投资，已经达到一千六百多万元，各部门和农业社主动让出的旧房屋共一万八千多间。
