To rapidly change the low-yield situation in northern regions, thirteen provinces and cities north of the Huai River, under the favorable conditions of large-scale water conservancy projects, are expanding rice cultivation on a large scale this year. The sown area will increase by approximately 50 million mu compared to 1957, bringing the total rice area to 80 million mu.

In early May, the provinces of North China and the Huaibei Plain basically completed the spring rice seedling cultivation. In Henan Province, the area for spring rice seedling cultivation had reached over 690,000 mu by mid-May. Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shaanxi, and the Huaibei regions of Anhui and Jiangsu are now universally beginning the seedling cultivation of rice after wheat harvest. The proportion of rice after wheat harvest is very large in these areas this year, accounting for about 70% of the rice field area.

The northeastern provinces and Inner Mongolia, where the season is later, began sowing and seedling cultivation successively in late April. In Liaoning Province, the seedling cultivation in the Andong area was basically completed in early May, and direct dry sowing of rice is underway. It is estimated that the rice field area in Liaoning Province will reach more than 8.7 million mu, doubling the area compared to 1957. In Inner Mongolia, land preparation and sowing were widely carried out in early May.

This year, the sowing and seedling cultivation of rice in the northern rice-growing areas are mostly more than ten days earlier than in previous years, and agricultural techniques such as seed selection and seed soaking have been widely adopted. Experiences such as semi-dry seedling fields, land nurseries, and cold-bed seedling cultivation have also been promoted on a larger scale.

In order to solve the technical problems of rice cultivation, large-scale technical training has been carried out in various places. Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and other provinces have adopted the methods of inviting experts and sending people out to train and cultivate approximately 2 million cadres and farmer technicians. Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and many prefectures and counties that develop rice cultivation have held rice professional meetings to study and arrange the tasks and measures for expanding rice cultivation. However, in some areas, the channel projects of water conservancy construction have not yet been completed, and the water management system has not been well established; in other areas, due to unfamiliarity with rice planting techniques, the progress of rice transplanting is relatively slow; and in some areas, floating seedlings and rotten seedlings have been found in seedling fields. These problems should be actively addressed.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing. Reporter Ma Xinren reports: Heilongjiang Province, located in the northernmost part of the country, is growing rice in every county this year. The province's rice planting area has expanded to 6 million mu this year, an increase of 2.19 million mu compared to last year. Currently, whether it is the warmer southern shores of Jingbo Lake or Huma County in the north where the frost-free period is only about 100 days a year, the fertile banks of the Ussuri River or the western grasslands with greater sandstorms, rice sowing has begun everywhere. The spring water is glistening in the rice paddies, and the male and female commune members with their trousers rolled up are busy sowing and transplanting rice, everywhere is a scene of the South.

The rice planted in Heilongjiang Province is all japonica rice, and the quality of the rice is particularly good, with the cooked rice being crystal clear and shiny. The yield per unit area of rice is also high, with each mu yielding more than 400 jin.

Heilongjiang Province began growing rice in Ning'an County in the southernmost part of the province in 1916. In the following thirty years, the total rice area in the province only developed to 1.8 million mu. In the twelve years from liberation to 1957, rice fields increased by 2.07 million mu.

The historical process of large-scale rice development in Heilongjiang Province shows that rice can also be developed on a large scale in northern China, where the temperature is low and the frost-free period is short. In order to adapt to the natural conditions of the short frost-free period, the peasants, scientific research institutions, and agricultural departments of Heilongjiang pay close attention to the selection and breeding of superior rice varieties. More than a dozen excellent varieties have now been successfully cultivated, two of which have a growth period of only ninety-odd days, and rice can also be developed on a large scale in Huma County, north of 51 degrees north latitude. This shows that some qualities of rice have also changed under human effort. According to a professor at Northeast Agricultural College, the total amount of temperature required for the entire growth period of rice in the south is more than 3,000 degrees Celsius, while Heilongjiang rice only needs more than 2,000 degrees to mature. In the past two or three years, many villages in Heilongjiang Province that do not rely on rivers and lakes have used ditches, springs, and even well water to grow rice. The water from these sources is too cold, so the farmers lengthen the channels and build water ponds to expose the water to sunlight for a longer period of time to raise the temperature before irrigating the rice fields. Various places have also created and reformed a large number of rice field sowing tools, of which there are now hundreds. These tools not only improve the quality of sowing but also alleviate the shortage of sowing labor. In the current urgent rice sowing, various places have also organized cooperation between communes and even between counties. Counties and communes with experience in rice cultivation have also sent experienced farmers to counties and communes that have newly developed rice fields to serve as technical guidance. Each special district has also universally organized rice field technical visits and technical training classes, and this spring alone, the province has trained 70,000 farmer rice field technicians.

    改变低产面貌的一项战略措施
    北方扩种水稻猛追江南
    十三省市增加五千万亩，黑龙江稻田春水莹莹正在播种插秧
    本报讯　为了迅速改变北方地区的低产面貌，淮河以北十三个省市在大兴水利的有利条件下，今年大规模扩种水稻，播种面积比1957年增加五千万亩左右，水稻总面积共达八千万亩。
    华北各省和淮北平原在5月上旬已基本完成了春稻的育秧工作。河南省春稻育秧面积在5月中已达六十九万多亩。河南、河北、山东、陕西和安徽、江苏的淮北地区，现在都普遍开始了麦茬稻的育秧工作。这些地区今年麦茬稻的比重很大，约占稻田面积的70％。
    季节较晚的东北各省和内蒙古等地，在4月下旬先后开始播种、育秧。辽宁省安东地区的育秧工作在5月上旬已基本结束，水稻的旱直播正在进行中。辽宁省的稻田面积预计可完成八百七十多万亩，将比1957年增加一倍。内蒙古地区在5月上旬普遍进行整地、播种。
    今年北方稻区的水稻播种、育秧大部比往年提早十多天，而且较普遍地采用了选种、浸种等农业技术。半旱秧田，陆床、冷床育秧等经验也得到了较大面积的推广。
    为了解决种植水稻的技术问题，各地开展了大规模的技术训练。河北、河南、山东等省都采用了请进来、派出去的办法训练培养干部和农民技术员达二百万人左右。河南、河北、陕西等省和许多发展水稻的专区、县都曾召开了水稻专业会议，研究布置了扩种水稻的任务与措施。但是，有一些地区在兴修水利方面，渠道工程尚未完成，管水制度还未很好建立；另一些地区由于种稻技术不熟练，水稻插秧进度比较迟缓；还有些地区秧田发现漂秧和烂秧现象。这些问题都应当积极设法解决。
    本报讯　记者马新仁报道：位于全国最北部的黑龙江省今年县县种水稻。全省今年水稻播种面积扩大到六百万亩，比去年增加二百一十九万亩。目前，不论是气候较暖和的南部镜泊湖滨、北部全年无霜期只有一百天上下的呼玛县，土地肥沃的乌苏里江边和风沙较大的西部草原，都开始播种水稻。各地稻田里春水莹莹，挽着裤管的男女社员们都忙着播种插秧，处处是江南景色。
    黑龙江省种植的水稻都是粳稻，稻米质量特佳，煮出饭来晶莹有光。水稻的单位面积产量也高，每亩产量能超过四百斤。
    黑龙江省从1916年在最南部的宁安县开始种水稻，其后三十年间全省水稻总面积只发展到一百八十万亩，解放后到1957年的十二年中，水稻田增加了二百零七万亩。
    黑龙江省大量发展水稻的历史过程说明，我国北方气温较低无霜期短也能大量发展水稻。为了适应无霜期短的自然条件，黑龙江的农民、科学研究机关和农业部门的干部都十分注意选育水稻良种。现在已有十多个优良品种培育成功，其中有两个品种的生育期只要九十几天，在北纬五十一度以北的呼玛县也可以大量发展水稻。这说明水稻的某些品质，在人的努力下也起了变化。据东北农学院一位教授测定，在南方，水稻整个生育期需要的温度总量是摄氏三千多度，黑龙江水稻只要二千多度就成熟了。近两三年，黑龙江省许多不靠江河湖泊的乡村，利用沟、泉甚至井水种植水稻。这些水源的水太凉，农民就加长渠道和修晒水池，让水经过较长时间的阳光曝晒，提高温度后灌入稻田。各地还创造和改革了大量的水田播种工具，现在已有几百件，不但可以提高播种质量，而且可以缓和播种劳动力的不足。在目前紧迫水稻播种中，各地还组织社与社甚至县与县之间的协作。种水稻有经验的县、社还抽出经验丰富的农民到新发展水田的县、社担任技术指导。各专区也普遍组织水田技术参观和开办水田技术训练班，今年一个春天训练的农民水田技术员全省已有七万人。（附图片）
