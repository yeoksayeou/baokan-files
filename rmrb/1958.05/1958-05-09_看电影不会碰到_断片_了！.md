No More "Blanking Out" While Watching Movies!

    (Our report) In most cinemas, there are two projectors, and film reels are changed manually. When the film on one machine ends, the other must take over seamlessly within a second. Despite the projectionist's best efforts, it is sometimes unavoidable that the transition is not precise. If the changeover is too fast by a few seconds, overlapping images appear on the screen. If it is too slow by a few seconds, chaotic lines dance on the screen. Projectionists at two cinemas in Shanghai have created an automated device that eliminates this phenomenon, which causes dissatisfaction among the audience and gives the projectionist a headache.
    With the use of the "Automatic Film Projector Equipment," strenuous labor is replaced by machinery, and the accuracy of the film reel changeover reaches a few hundredths of a second. Originally, two projectors required two people to manage them; now, only one person is needed, and it saves a significant amount of electricity and carbon rods. (According to Xinwen Ribao)

Embroidery Factory

    Changsha is in the process of constructing a Xiang embroidery factory. This factory will be a four-story building occupying four thousand square meters. To facilitate production, tours, and sales, the sales department, exhibition room, and production workshops are all located in this building.
    Xiang embroidery is a unique handicraft of Hunan Province. As early as 1898, embroidery workshops were established in Changsha. Before Liberation, Xiang embroidery had declined. After Liberation, Xiang embroidery production greatly developed. After the embroidery workers joined the production cooperatives in 1956, production increased even faster. The total value of production this year will be more than fifty times greater than in 1952.

    看电影不会碰到“断片”了！
    本报讯　一般电影院内都有两架放映机，人工掌握轮流换片。一架机器上的片子完了，另一架必须一秒也不错地接上去。放映员虽然使用出全副的精力，有时还免不了接得不准，有时接快了几秒钟，银幕上出现重叠的图景，慢了几秒钟，混乱的线条就在银幕上跳动。上海两家电影院的放映员创造了一种自动装置，消除了这种引起观众不满、使放映员十分伤脑筋的现象。
    使用“电影放映机自动化设备”，紧张的劳动被机械所代替，换片的准确度达到几百分之一秒。原来两部放映机需两个人管理，现在只要一个人，而且节省大量电力和炭精。（据新闻日报）绣花工厂
    长沙市正在动工兴建一座湘绣厂。这座工厂将是占地四千平方公尺的四层楼房。为了便于生产、参观和销售，门市部、展览室和生产车间都在这座楼上。
    湘绣是湖南省的特种手工艺品，早在1898年，长沙就成立了绣坊。解放前，湘绣曾衰落下去。解放后湘绣生产得到很大发展。1956年绣工们加入生产合作社以后，生产增加更快。今年的总产值将比1952年增加五十多倍。
