　　Making Ventilation Pipes and Water Pipes with Willow Branches

　　The local state-owned Xinmin County Willow Branch Factory in Liaoning Province has recently used willow branches to weave ventilation pipes for mines and water pipes for agricultural water use. According to the appraisal by the mining department, this kind of willow-woven pipe can be used for ventilation in mines for about five years, which is more than half the cost of the currently used rubber pipes.

　　The method of making pipes with willow branches is very simple and convenient to use. It can be processed and woven into different specifications according to the user's needs. Iron hoops are added inside and outside the pipe, and they are dipped and boiled with a mixture of asphalt oil and lime, and then dried.

　　Most of the ventilation pipes used in mines are steel pipes or rubber pipes. In the current situation where the national supply of steel and rubber is relatively tight, all localities should consider promoting the experience of using willow branches to weave ventilation pipes and water pipes.

　　用柳条制通风管和输水管
    地方国营辽宁省新民县柳条厂最近利用柳条编成矿山用的通风管和农业水利用的输水管，根据矿山部门的鉴定，这种柳条编制的管子，用在矿山上通风，一般可使用五年左右，比目前用的胶皮管成本低一半多。
    用柳条编管子，制法很简单，使用轻便，可以根据用户需要的大小不同规格，任意加工编织，管子里外都加上铁篐，用沥青油和石灰混合搅拌蘸煮涂刷，晾干即成。
    矿山通风用的通风管，大部分使用钢管或胶皮管，在当前国家钢材和橡胶供应较紧张的情况下，各地应该考虑推广利用柳条编制通风管和输水管的经验。
