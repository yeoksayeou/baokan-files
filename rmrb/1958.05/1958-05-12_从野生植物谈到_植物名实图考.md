From Wild Plants to "Illustrated Compendium of Materia Medica and Natural History"
		Ruo Si

　　In the high tide of the great leap forward in production, like ten thousand horses galloping, many beneficial wild plants have been discovered and utilized in the cause of socialist construction thanks to the strength and wisdom of the broad masses. These wild plants have considerable economic value. Some can be pressed for oil, some can be used to make wine, some can be used to make sugar, some can be used as fertilizer, some can be used to kill insects and treat diseases, some can be used as substitutes for grain, some can be used as livestock feed, and some can be used as textile raw materials. The breadth of their uses is astonishing. If this social wealth hidden in the deep mountains and wilderness is fully utilized, it will undoubtedly be of great benefit to our socialist construction.

　　Expanding the use of wild plants requires testing, trial production, and identification to realize their multiple uses. However, since wild plants are distributed quite sparsely, are highly seasonal, and have many cases of different things with the same name and the same thing with different names, it seems quite necessary to conduct a general survey and collect specimens nationwide first. Before the survey work begins, certain clues are needed. In this regard, past literature can still be of considerable help to us. Local chronicles should certainly be noted, but the botanical monographs of our predecessors are especially important. In this regard, "Illustrated Compendium of Materia Medica and Natural History" written by Wu Qijun (1789-1874) of the Qing Dynasty (Commercial Press, 1957 edition) is a book worth introducing.

　　"Illustrated Compendium of Materia Medica and Natural History" is a voluminous work of about 700,000 words, with illustrations and text, totaling thirty-eight volumes. Among them, two volumes are on grains, four volumes are on vegetables, four volumes are on mountain grasses, five volumes are on wetland grasses, three volumes combine rock grasses and aquatic grasses, seven volumes combine vine grasses, fragrant grasses, and poisonous grasses, five volumes are on flowering plants, two volumes are on fruits, and six volumes are on trees. It contains a total of 1,714 kinds of plants, citing as many as 800 books. Each plant is accompanied by detailed illustrations, and the text descriptions introduce its shape, color, taste, uses, and origin in detail. Except for grains, most of them are wild. The author pays the most attention to medicinal uses, but does not ignore the economic value of these plants. For example, madder, greenbrier, buckthorn juice, and the fruit of the incense tree can be used as dyes (Volumes 22, 33, and 38); sugar thorn fruit can be boiled to make sugar (Volume 31); wine yeast tree leaves can be used to make koji (Volume 38); betel palm leaves can be woven into cloth and mats (Volume 32); in addition to papermaking and weaving, the white juice of the paper mulberry bark can also be used as glue. As for *Litsea cubeba* (May Chang) and *Dioscorea cirrhosa*, which have been introduced on page 2 of the "People's Daily" on April 12 and by the Central People's Broadcasting Station, the book also discusses them:

　　*Litsea cubeba*: "The Kaibao Materia Medica began to record it. Illustrated Classic says that Guangdong also has it. The leaves are clear and smooth, and the fruit is like tung seeds. *Hai Yao Ben Cao* (referring to *Hai Yao Ben Cao*) thinks it is the tender part of pepper. *Guangxi Zhi* has mountain pepper, or some say it is *Litsea cubeba*." "*Guangxi Tongzhi*: Mountain pepper, in summer, people in Quanzhou use it as a substitute for tea, which can clear away heat and benefit qi greatly, or some think it is *Litsea cubeba*." (Volumes 25, 37)

　　*Dioscorea cirrhosa*: "*Dioscorea cirrhosa* is produced in the mountains of Fujian and Guangdong. It grows without flowers, and the leaves are pointed and long like oleander, with small thorns at the nodes. The roots are like yam with hair, shaped like taro, varying in size. The outer skin is black, and the inner flesh is reddish-yellow. It grows downwards node by node, with one node growing each year, growing wild. The locals dig up its roots, boil the juice to dye nets and ropes, which do not get wet when immersed in water. The roots are left in the mountains, growing continuously. *Nan Yue Bi Ji* says that *Dioscorea cirrhosa* produced in the North River is good, and the white ones are useless, and must be used with red ones. The red ones have more gelatinous liquid, and fishermen use them to dye fishing nets and ropes to make ramie crisp and strong, which is both water-repellent and resistant to salty tides, and not easy to rot. The gelatinous liquid of *Dioscorea cirrhosa* is originally red, but turns black when it meets water. ... Dyeing fishing nets and ropes to make them black, then fish will gather when they see it." (Volume 9)

　　The above are just a few examples. Because the author advocates "seeing with one's own eyes," emphasizes practice, and does not completely rely on materials in books, many illustrations are drawn according to real objects, so the content has a certain degree of reliability. At the same time, it pays special attention to the research of plants with the same name but different things and plants with the same thing but different names, and records the most common names. Many of these common names are still used by the people today, which is also quite useful for our current work of surveying wild plants. However, it must be pointed out that this book is, after all, a product of the 19th century. Limited by the author's scientific knowledge and experience, despite great efforts in the study of botany, it is still impossible to be completely accurate and comprehensive, and even some errors are inevitable. This is what we should pay attention to when using this book.

　　The "Illustrated Compendium" was first engraved in 1848, and the first typesetting and printing by the Commercial Press was published in 1919. Last year, the museum re-typeset and printed it after comparing the original typesetting and printing with the original copy, adding new punctuation marks to all of them, and adding four kinds of classified indexes of plant names, personal names, place names, and cited books at the end of the book, repairing the illustrations, and re-typesetting and publishing. The plant name index allows the materials discussing the same plant but scattered in several places to be concentrated, and it is convenient to check common names and variant names; the place name index is helpful for understanding the geographical distribution of plants; the illustrations have been repaired and are more complete than the woodcut version and the old typesetting and printing version.

　　从野生植物谈到“植物名实图考”
　　若思
    在万马奔腾般的生产大跃进高潮中，由于发挥了广大群众的力量和智慧，很多大有益处的野生植物被发现，并被利用到社会主义建设事业上了。这些野生植物，具有不小的经济价值。它们有的可以榨油，有的可以酿酒，有的可以制糖，有的可以作肥料，有的可以杀虫、治病，有的可以代替粮食，有的可作牲畜饲料，有的可作纺织原料，用途之广，是非常惊人的。这笔蕴藏在深山旷野里的社会财富，如果充分加以利用，无疑对我们的社会主义建设会有很大的好处。
    扩大利用野生植物，当然要经过化验、试制、鉴定，才能发挥它们的多种用途。但由于野生植物的生长地区相当分散，季节性强，而且同名异物、同物异名的很多，所以在全国范围内先作一次普查和采集标本的工作，似乎是十分必要的。调查工作进行之前，需要一定的线索，就这一点来说，过去的文献材料，对我们还有相当的帮助。地方志固然应当注意，而前人的植物学专著尤其重要。在这一方面，清代吴其浚（1789—1874）所著“植物名实图考”（商务印书馆1957年版）是值得介绍的一部书。
    “植物名实图考”是一部七十万字左右的巨著，有图有文，共为三十八卷。其中谷类两卷，蔬类四卷，山草四卷，隰草五卷，石草、水草合三卷，蔓草、芳草、毒草合七卷，群芳五卷，果类两卷，木类六卷。共收植物一千七百十四种，征引书籍达八百种之多。每种植物都附有精细的插图，文字说明中比较详尽地介绍了它的形色、性味、用途和产地。除谷类以外，大部分是属于野生的。作者最注重的是医药用途，但对于这些植物的经济价值也不忽略。例如茜草、菝葜、鼠李汁、代香树实可作染料（卷二十二、三十三、三十八）；糖刺果可以熬糖（卷三十一）；酒药子树叶可做酒曲（卷三十八）；槟槟叶可织布，也可编席（卷三十二）；楮皮除造纸、织布而外，其中白汁还可代胶。至于4月12日“人民日报”第二版及中央人民广播电台已介绍过的山苍子（毕澄茄）、薯莨等，该书也有论述：
    毕澄茄：“开宝本草始著录。图经云，广东亦有之。叶清滑，子似梧桐子，海药（按指海药本草）以为即胡椒之嫩者。广西志有山胡椒，或谓即毕澄茄也。”“广西通志：山胡椒，夏月全州人以代茗饮，大能清暑益气，或以为即毕澄茄。”（卷二十五、三十七）
    薯莨：“薯莨产闽、广诸山。?生无花，叶形尖长如夹竹桃，节节有小刺。根如山药有毛，形如芋子，大小不一。外皮黑色，内肉红黄色。节节向下生，每年生一节，野生。土人挖取其根，煮汁染网?，入水不濡。留根在山，生生不息。南越笔记，薯莨产北江者良，其白者不中用，用必以红。红者多胶液，渔人以染罛?，使苎麻爽劲，既利水，又耐咸潮，不易腐。薯莨胶液本红，见水则黑。……染罛?使黑，则鱼望之而聚云。”（卷九）
    以上所举，不过是几个例子。由于作者主张“目验”，强调实践，不完全依赖书本上的材料，许多插图是按照实物绘成的，因此内容有一定的可靠性。同时它特别重视同名异物、同物异名植物的研究，记载俗称最多，这些俗称，有不少至今被人民群众沿用着，对于我们当前调查野生植物的工作，也颇有用处。然而必须指出，本书毕竟是十九世纪的产物，作者为科学知识和见闻所限，尽管对于植物学的研究，已付出很大努力，还不可能十分精确和全面，甚至难免会有些错误。这是我们使用本书应当注意的地方。
    “图考”初刻于1848年，商务印书馆的第一次排印本在1919年出版。去年该馆又以原排印本与底本对校一过，全部加了新式标点，书后增编植物名称、人名、地名、引书四种分类索引，修整插图，重行排印出版。植物名称索引使论述同一植物而散见几处的材料得以集中，并便于查考俗名、异名；地名索引对于了解植物地区分布的情况很有帮助；插图经过修补，亦较木刻本及旧排印本完整。
