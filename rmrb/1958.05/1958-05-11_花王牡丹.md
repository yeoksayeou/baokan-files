　　King of Flowers: Peony
　　Zhou Jiaqi
    The peony, with its large and beautiful blossoms, has long been revered in our country as the "King of Flowers." It is a shrub of the Ranunculaceae family, native to northwestern China, growing up to six or seven feet tall with thick branches and large, long-stemmed leaves. Peony flowers exhibit a great variety of forms and extremely rich colors. A single plant can bear dozens to over a hundred flowers, and even up to a thousand. As recorded in "Youyang Zazu": "At Xing Tang Temple, there is a peony plant that bore one thousand two hundred flowers in the Yuanhe era." One can imagine the magnificent scene.
    The history of peony cultivation in our country dates back at least one thousand four hundred years. During the Kaiyuan era of the Tang Dynasty, it "began to flourish in Chang'an." By the Song Dynasty, the varieties gradually increased, and cultivation became more widespread. However, in terms of variety and cultivation techniques, "the flowers of Luoyang" were considered the best in the world. Today, this famous flower of our country is widely cultivated in countries around the world, and some hybridization breeding work has been carried out. For example, in France, golden yellow peonies were initially obtained through interspecific hybridization.
    In ancient China, there were many books specifically written about peonies, such as Ouyang Xiu's "Record of Luoyang Peonies," Lu You's "Tianpeng Peony Manual," and Xue Fengxiang's "Eight Books on Peonies" since the Song Dynasty. This shows that peonies have long been loved by ancient Chinese scholars and the general public. Viewing peonies in spring has become a popular activity in various places.
    Since liberation, the number of peony lovers in various places has been increasing. In Beijing, Zhongshan Park boasts the most abundant peonies, most of which are over thirty years old, and there are also many old trees over forty or fifty years old. Under the diligent cultivation of skilled workers, they grow well, with huge flower wheels. Every year around "May Day," the peonies bloom successively, magnificent and spectacular.
    The achievements of our country's flower farmers in cultivating peony varieties have long been valued by biologists. The "Qunfang Pu" records the grand occasion of large-scale sowing and cultivation of new varieties in those years.
    Peonies are not only for ornamental purposes, but their large, fleshy roots are also an important medicinal material, commonly known as "Danpi." Currently, Heze in Shandong Province is an important production area for peonies and Danpi.
    Peonies are suitable for planting in the north. Their propagation methods include sowing, division, and grafting. It takes six or seven years for seedlings to flower after sowing, and the cultivation time is too long, and most seedlings from sowing are of poor quality. Therefore, this method is only used when breeding new varieties. In addition to the division method, grafting is generally used for propagation, using coarse peony or peony roots as rootstocks and grafting the branches of excellent peony varieties onto them. Peony planting should be done after the autumnal equinox and is not suitable in spring.
    Now, many peonies have been collected in parks in the north and south, and they are currently blooming successively. Let flower lovers grasp the flowering period in the Red May and come to appreciate this famous flower in a timely manner!

　　花王牡丹
　　周家琪
    牡丹花大而美，在我国久誉为“花中之王”。它是原产我国西北部的一种毛茛科灌木，高可达六七尺，枝干粗壮，叶大柄长。牡丹花型变化很多，花色极为富丽，一株着花数十朵至百余朵，甚至有达千余朵者。如“酉阳杂俎”中载：“兴唐寺有牡丹一窠，元和中着花一千二百朵。”其壮丽的情景可以想见。
    我国栽培牡丹的历史至少已有一千四百多年了。唐朝开元年间“始盛于长安”，到宋朝以后品种日渐繁多，栽培日益普遍，不过当时按品种和栽培技术而论，均以“洛阳之花”称天下冠。今日世界各国都盛栽我国这种名花，并已进行了一些杂交育种工作。例如在法国最初就用种间杂交获得了金黄色的牡丹等。
    在我国古代并有很多专写牡丹的书籍，像宋代以来就有欧阳修的“洛阳牡丹记”；陆游：“天彭牡丹谱”；薛凤翔：“牡丹八书”等。足见牡丹久已为我国古代文人和广大人民所热爱。春日看牡丹，在各地都成为时尚。
    解放以来，各地爱牡丹者日益增多。北京的牡丹以中山公园为最盛，大都树龄在三十年生以上，而四五十年以上的老树也有不少。它们在技工的辛勤培育下生长良好，花轮巨大，每年“五一”前后，牡丹先后盛开，富丽堂皇，蔚为大观。
    我国花农在培育牡丹品种工作中的成绩早就受到了生物学家的重视。“群芳谱”中记载了当年大规模播种培育新品种的盛况。
    牡丹不仅可供观赏，它肥大的肉质根又是重要的药材，通称“丹皮”。目前山东菏泽是牡丹和丹皮的重要产地。
    牡丹适合在北方种植。它的繁殖方法有播种、分株和嫁接等。播种后六七年始可开花，培育时间太长而且播种苗开花大多品质不佳，因此只在选育新品种时才采用这个方法。一般繁殖除采用分株法外，大多用粗种牡丹或芍药根为砧木，把优良牡丹品种的枝条嫁接在它的上面。牡丹栽植均在秋分以后，不宜在春季进行。
    现在南北各地公园中都搜集了不少牡丹，目前正在先后开放。让爱花的人们在红五月里掌握花期，及时地来观赏此名花吧！
