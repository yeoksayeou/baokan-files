　　Grasp Consolidation Work

　　Following closely on the heels of the large-scale establishment of people-run agricultural middle schools, how to consolidate these schools has become one of the most important current tasks.
　　At the beginning of the establishment of people-run agricultural middle schools, there were problems in terms of teacher quality, teaching content, and teaching methods. This is inevitable and normal. However, some cadres and the masses, influenced by the idea of "regularization" and traditional habits, have already begun to criticize. Some say that people-run agricultural middle schools are "born improperly and will not live long"; others feel that people-run middle schools are very simple and crude, "not much like a middle school." This kind of thinking is very wrong. People-run agricultural middle schools or other people-run vocational middle schools are produced and developed under the growing cultural demands of the broad masses. They correspondingly meet the learning requirements of the vast number of farmers and graduates of higher primary schools, are warmly welcomed by the masses, and meet the needs of the masses and the country. As far as the broad masses are concerned, having a school is better than not having a school, being able to study is better than not being able to study, and studying for a few more years is better than studying for a few fewer years. As for whether it looks like a school, the masses do not care. Moreover, the vast majority of people-run middle schools are now taking shape. School teaching is generally combined with the reality of production and the reality of social struggle. Students not only learn certain basic cultural and scientific knowledge in school, but also learn certain production skills. This kind of school is a "decent school." Our task is to mobilize the masses, do everything possible to spend the least amount of money, run various forms of cultural and educational undertakings, and enable the most people to receive cultural, scientific, and technological education. At present, the agricultural middle schools and various vocational middle schools run by the masses in various places are an integral part of secondary education. Its task, like that of ordinary middle schools, is to cultivate cultured laborers with socialist consciousness for industrial and agricultural production. It has broad prospects for development.
　　Now, the regions where people-run agricultural middle schools developed earlier have begun to pay attention to consolidation work, and have already achieved good experience. Gongxian County, Henan Province, has established a guidance network with public middle schools as the center, conducts planned guidance for teachers in people-run schools to gradually improve their professional level; and properly solves the arrangement of students' study, work, and rest time, so that a few students who dropped out have returned to school. Their approach is good. We must seize the link of consolidation work, and creatively put forward specific methods suitable for the actual conditions of each region according to the local actual conditions. Being satisfied with the achievements of the great development of people-run agricultural middle schools and neglecting consolidation work is wrong, which will bring great losses to the work. The consolidation work of people-run agricultural middle schools should follow the example of ordinary schools and learn the methods of ordinary schools, which is also not feasible. People-run agricultural middle schools should be said to be a new type of school produced under the current situation in our country. A set of methods for this type of school is waiting for us to create.
　　This work, like all other work, has difficulties; however, as long as we do it conscientiously and practically, the difficulties can be overcome and the people-run middle schools can be consolidated. The large-scale development and consolidation of people-run agricultural middle schools will greatly improve people's cultural level, thereby playing a major role in our country's construction undertakings and technological revolution.

    紧跟着民办农业中学的大量创办，如何把这些学校巩固下来，已成为当前重要的课题之一。
    民办农业中学在创办之初，师资水平、教学内容和教学方法等方面都存在着问题。这是必然的，也是正常的。但是，有些干部和群众由于“正规化”的思想影响和传统的习惯看法，已经开始指手划脚地在批评了。有的说民办农业中学“出胎不正，寿命不长”；有的觉得民办中学很简陋，“不大像个中学样”。这种思想很不对头。民办农业中学或其他民办职业中学，是在广大群众日益增长的文化要求下产生和发展起来的。它相应地满足了广大农民和高小毕业生的学习要求，受到群众的热烈欢迎，是符合于群众和国家的需要的。从广大群众来说，只要有学校就比没有学校好，能读书就比不能读书好，多读几年书就比少读几年书好。至于像不像个学校样，群众是不去计较的。况且现在绝大多数民办中学已初具规模，学校教学一般都结合生产实际和社会斗争实际，学生在学校里不仅学习某几门文化科学基础知识，而且学到一定的生产技能。这种学校就是“像样的学校”。我们的任务就是要发动群众，千方百计地花最少的钱，举办多种形式的文化教育事业，使最多的人受到文化科学技术的教育。现在各地由群众举办的农业中学和各种职业中学是中学教育的一个组成部分，它的任务同普通中学一样是为工农业生产培养有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。它有广阔的发展前途。
    现在，民办农业中学发展较早的地区已经开始注意巩固工作，并且已经取得较好的经验。河南省巩县以公立中学为中心建立辅导网，有计划地对民办学校教师进行辅导，逐步提高其业务水平；并且妥善地解决了学生的学习、劳动和休息时间的安排，使少数退学的学生又回到了学校。他们的作法是好的。我们要抓紧巩固工作这一环，根据当地的实际条件，创造性地提出适合于每个地区实际情况的具体办法。满足于民办农业中学大发展的成绩，忽视巩固工作是错误的，那将给工作带来很大的损失。民办农业中学的巩固工作向普通学校看齐，学普通学校的一套办法，那也是不行的。民办农业中学应当说是我国当前情况下所产生的一种新型学校，这种学校的一套作法，正有待于我们去创立。
    这项工作，也像所有其他工作一样是有困难的；但是，只要我们认真切实地去干，困难是可以克服的，民办中学是可以巩固的。民办农业中学的大量发展和巩固，将大大提高人们的文化水平，从而在我国的建设事业和技术革命中起到重大的作用。
