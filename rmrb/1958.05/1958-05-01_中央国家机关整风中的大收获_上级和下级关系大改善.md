    This newspaper dispatch: The great rectification movement, using democratic forms such as great airing of views, great debates, and big-character posters to sweep away the dust in human relationships, has brought about profound changes in the relationship between leaders and those being led within the central state organs.
    In the past, some leading comrades were not very patient in listening to the opinions of lower-level cadres, especially when they differed from their own. This style of work has changed during the rectification movement. Lin Zi'an, director of the Vehicle Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, is one example of this change. Before the rectification, he was not very willing to patiently listen to the opinions of lower-level cadres. If he thought a document drafted by subordinates was not good, his attitude would be poor, making many people unwilling to approach him. Now, he can personally review and revise documents drafted by subordinates or patiently offer opinions. Even when he writes documents himself, he can solicit the opinions of the chief engineer, who is very touched. Lin Zi'an not only began to actively solicit opinions from lower-level cadres, but also accepted the opinions of subordinates when his own opinions were incorrect. Last spring, the Ministry of Railways wanted to build a vehicle section for mechanical refrigerated cars. Lin Zi'an advocated building it in Location A, while Feng Dasheng, a cadre from the Freight Bureau, advocated building it in Location B. At that time, Lin Zi'an did not listen to Feng Dasheng's opinion very well and said that if problems occurred with building it in Location B, you would be responsible, scaring Feng Dasheng from debating with him. During this rectification, Feng Dasheng raised this issue with Lin Zi'an again. This time, Lin Zi'an said, "Tell me, as long as you can convince me, I will agree with your opinion." When Feng Dasheng elaborated on his opinion in detail, explaining that setting it up in Location B would save more than 4 million yuan in transportation costs alone each year compared to setting it up in Location A, Lin Zi'an retracted his opinion and agreed with Feng Dasheng's opinion.
    Many units in the central state organs not only pay attention to treating lower-level cadres in the organs with an equal attitude, but also pay attention to treating cadres from subordinate grass-roots units and local cadres with an equal attitude. Recently, many ministries convened meetings of factory directors and mine managers, and meetings of four-level cadres, all of which changed the old habit of only having leading cadres criticize grass-roots cadres in the past, and first let everyone offer opinions on the leadership of the ministry. At the four-level cadre meeting convened by the Ministry of Coal Industry, leading cadres at the level of party members and bureau directors repeatedly mobilized everyone to offer opinions on the party group and the leading cadres of the ministry. As a result, many comrades criticized the leading comrades of the ministry by name, title, and specific event. In the past, it was often very difficult for cadres from provinces and cities to see the leaders of the ministry when they came to the central organs to ask for instructions. Recently, a responsible cadre from the Xinxiang Municipal Party Committee of Henan Province came to Beijing to ask the Ministry of Electricity to help solve the problem of insufficient electricity. The responsible comrades of the Ministry of Electricity received him and solved the problem for him. Before leaving, he said that his biggest feeling during this trip to Beijing was that "it is easier to see the minister" and that problems were solved quickly.
    Another significant change in the relationship between superiors and subordinates is that leading comrades care about the thoughts and lives of lower-level cadres, and everyone is integrated in daily life. Leading comrades have heart-to-heart talks with lower-level cadres to solve their ideological problems; they visit cadres' homes to care about their family life and health; they participate in cultural and recreational activities with everyone during off-hours, clean up and eliminate the four pests together, and write big-character posters together during the great airing of views... This is no longer an isolated phenomenon in the central state organs, but a fairly common one. (Attached picture)

### 中央国家机关整风中的大收获  上级和下级关系大改善

    中央国家机关整风中的大收获
    上级和下级关系大改善
    本报讯　伟大的整风运动，运用大鸣大放大辩论大字报等民主形式冲刷人和人关系中的灰尘，使中央国家机关内领导和被领导的关系发生了深刻的变化。
    过去，有些领导同志不大能耐心听取下级干部的意见，特别不爱听和自己不同的意见。在整风中这种作风有了转变。铁道部车辆局局长蔺子安，便是这种转变的很多例子中的一个，他在整风前不大愿意耐心听取下级干部的意见，下面干部起草了文件，只要他认为不好，态度就不好，弄得许多人不愿和他接近。现在下面干部起草的文件，他都能亲自审阅修改或耐心提出意见。就是他自己写了文件，也能向主管工程师征求意见，工程师很受感动。蔺子安不但开始主动地向下级干部征求意见，而且当自己的意见不正确的时候，能够接受下级意见。去年春天，铁道部要建立一个机械冷藏车的车辆段。蔺子安主张建立在甲地，货运局的干部冯大生主张建立在乙地。当时，蔺子安没有很好地听取冯大生的意见，就说，建立在乙地如果发生问题由你负责，吓得冯大生不敢和他辩论。这一次整改中，冯大生重新向蔺子安提出这个问题，这次蔺子安说：“你说吧，只要你能说服我，我就同意你的意见”。当冯大生详细阐述了自己的意见，说明设在乙地单是运输成本，每年就比设在甲地节省四百多万元，蔺子安果然收回了自己的意见，同意了冯大生的意见。
    中央国家机关许多单位不仅注意用平等态度对待机关里的下级干部，也注意用平等态度对待所属基层单位的干部以及地方干部。最近，许多部召开的厂矿长会议，四级干部会议，都改变了过去只是领导干部批评基层干部的老习惯，首先让大家对部的领导提意见。在煤炭部召开的四级干部会议上，党组成员，司局长一级领导干部都再三动员大家对党组对部的领导干部提意见。结果，许多同志都指名指姓指事地批评部的领导同志。过去省市的干部到中央机关来请示工作，要见到部的领导人常常是很困难的；最近中共河南省新乡市委一位负责干部来北京请求电力部帮助解决电力不足问题，电力部负责同志接见了他，为他解决了问题，临走时他曾说，这次他来北京最大的感觉是“部长好见了”，解决问题快了。
    上下级关系另一个显著的改变是：领导同志关心下级干部的思想和生活，在日常生活中大家打成一片。领导同志和下级干部一起谈心，为大家解决思想问题；到干部家里串门探望，关心干部的家庭生活和健康；工余和大家一起参加文化娱乐活动，一起大扫除除四害，大鸣大放时和大家一起写大字报……，这在中央国家机关已不是个别的而是相当普遍的现象了。（附图片）
