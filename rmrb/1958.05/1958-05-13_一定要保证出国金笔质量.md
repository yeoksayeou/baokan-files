　　Must Guarantee the Quality of Gold Pens for Export
    Soviet comrades like gold pens produced in China very much. Recently, a batch of "Guangming," "Yongsheng," and "Xinmin" brand gold pens arrived here from China and were quickly sold out. Two associate professors at our school also hurriedly bought two "Xinmin" brand gold pens. Unfortunately, these two pens broke down in less than two weeks. One had a broken rubber sac, and the other had a nib that split and could not write (the Soviet Union does not have rubber sacs and nibs of the same type as mine, so they cannot be replaced). These two pens were produced by the Huafu Factory. It is hoped that the Huafu Factory will improve the quality of gold pens. It is also suggested that goods for export in the future should be strictly inspected to ensure quality, so as to avoid creating a negative impact.

### 一定要保证出国金笔质量

　　一定要保证出国金笔质量
    苏联同志们很喜欢中国出产的金笔。最近我们这里由中国来了一批光明牌、永生牌和新民牌金笔，很快就卖完了。我校有两位副教授也赶紧买了两支新民牌金笔。遗憾的是这两枝金笔没用到两个星期就坏了。一枝是橡皮管坏了，另一枝是笔头开花不能写字（苏联没有和我同型的皮管和笔尖，所以不能调换）。这两枝笔是华孚厂的出品。希望华孚厂提高金笔质量。并建议今后出国的商品，应该严格检查，保证质量，以免造成不良影响。中国留苏学生　姚筱煌
