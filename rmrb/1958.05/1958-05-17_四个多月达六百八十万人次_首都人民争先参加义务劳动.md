　　Over Six Million Eight Hundred Thousand Person-Times in More Than Four Months
　　People in the Capital Compete to Participate in Voluntary Labor
    (Our dispatch) Since the beginning of this year, for more than four months, more than six million eight hundred thousand person-times in the capital have participated in various voluntary labor activities such as water conservancy construction, drought resistance and sowing, afforestation, urban construction, and service industries.
    This unprecedented large-scale mass voluntary labor in the capital is an important result of the rectification movement. Through voluntary labor, people have not only improved their ideological awareness, strengthened their labor concepts, and strengthened the relationship between cadres and the masses, but also made the idea of ​​labor being glorious begin to take root in people's hearts, playing a role in changing customs and habits.
    The large number of participants, the wide range of aspects, the high enthusiasm of the people, and the vigorous display of the communist spirit are prominent features of this year's voluntary labor in the capital. In previous years, only机关 cadres, students, and officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army participated in voluntary labor. This year, not only workers and peasants, but also scientists, professors, writers, actors, doctors, capitalists, street residents, Christians, and Buddhists voluntarily participated. Many people who had never participated in physical labor in the past overcame various difficulties with tenacious spirit. Many people heroically called shoulder swelling, hand breaks, blisters on their feet, wind, sun, frost, rain, snow, freezing, and cold intrusion "comprehensive exercise".
    In the voluntary labor team at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site, Huang Jiguang teams, Liu Hulan teams, Dong Cunrui teams, and Paul teams named after people's heroes appeared everywhere. Their slogans were: living like workers and peasants, labor as combat, and action as military. The young men of the Paul Platoon of Beijing Normal University, holding high the portrait of "Paul Kochakin", worked vigorously. Some students carried four baskets of soil at a time and also carried a basket in their hands. Zhang Lin, a worker from the Ministry of Transportation, who was called "Little Luo Cheng" by the people, was in high spirits in the freezing cold. He said, "What is there to be afraid of the cold wind? The colder it is, the hotter I get." Liu Zeying, a female technician from the Water Transport Design Institute of this ministry, could not carry soil or shovel soil vigorously when she started working. After a few days of training, she joined the youth commando team and was able to do everything. People called her "Female Tiger General". Among the more than 190 people in the seventh batch of voluntary labor participants from the Ministry of Construction Engineering, an advanced squadron, five winning squads, six labor models, and twenty-six activists emerged.
    Many people have improved their ideological awareness and improved their work style in voluntary labor. Li Huaru, a designer from the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, realized the hardships of the country's construction through carrying each basket and shoveling each shovel of soil. He guaranteed that he would never waste a penny of the country's money in future designs. Li Zhenghong, a cadre from the Installation Company of the Second Commercial Department, said that he could not work as an electrician because his eyes were not good, and he disliked being a plumber because it was dirty and tiring. After voluntary labor, he decided to be a plumber. Liu Xiuqin, a hygienist at the Beijing Chinese Medicine Hospital, posted a big-character poster in the past, questioning the leaders why they let her be a hygienist. After returning to the hospital from voluntary labor, she posted another big-character poster to examine her erroneous ideas of ​​despising physical labor.
    Voluntary labor makes the relationship between leaders and those led, and between people, full of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship. Many leading cadres such as ministers, generals, bureau chiefs, section chiefs, and managers have also participated in voluntary labor with everyone. Luo Ruiqing, Minister of Public Security, Wang Shoudao, Minister of Transportation, and others used their holidays to go to the construction site and dig and carry soil with their comrades in the ministry. Chen Xilian, Commander of the Artillery of the People's Liberation Army, and the cadres of the Artillery Headquarters worked together for seven days, eating corn buns and sleeping on straw mats with everyone. Huang Wenming, a major general of the old Red Army who participated in the revolution for thirty years, was called a "good soldier" and a "good service member" because he actively worked and fetched water, served meals, and swept the floor for his comrades. Guan Wenxiong, a secretary of the General Office of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee, used to come to work and leave work and did not care about his comrades. This voluntary labor enabled him to establish a labor friendship with many comrades, and he often talked with Wang Baochang, the car driver who worked with him.
    At present, loving labor has become a new social atmosphere in the capital, and there are crowds of voluntary laborers everywhere. People used voluntary labor to build Dongfeng Lake, Rending Lake, Red Scarf Reservoir, Youth Forest, and Women's Forest. Many students from universities and middle schools use their holidays to serve audiences, tourists, and customers in cinemas, parks, shops, and other places. Some organizations have canceled or reduced public officials, and cadres clean their own offices.

　　四个多月达六百八十万人次
　　首都人民争先参加义务劳动
    本报讯　今年以来的四个多月中，首都已经有六百八十多万人次参加了兴修水利、抗旱播种、植树造林、城市建设和服务行业等各种各样的义务劳动。
    首都这种空前规模的群众性的义务劳动，是整风运动带来的一项重要成果。人们通过义务劳动，不仅提高了思想觉悟，加强了劳动观点，密切了干部和群众的关系，并且使劳动光荣的思想开始深入人心，起了移风易俗的作用。
    参加的人数多、方面广，人们的热情高，共产主义精神奋发，是首都今年义务劳动中一个显著的特点。往年参加义务劳动的只有机关干部、学生和解放军官兵，今年不但有工人和农民，连科学家、教授、作家、演员、医生、资本家、街道居民、基督教徒和佛教徒也都自愿地参加了。许多过去没有参加过体力劳动的人，都以顽强的精神克服各种困难。很多人把肩肿、手破、脚起泡和风吹、日晒、霜打、雨淋、雪冻、寒侵，豪迈地称之为“全面锻炼”。
    在十三陵水库工地的义务劳动队伍里，到处出现了以人民英雄命名的黄继光队、刘胡兰队、董存瑞队和保尔队，他们的口号是：生活工农化、劳动战斗化、行动军事化。北京师范大学保尔排的小伙子们，高举着“保尔·柯察金”的画像，生龙活虎地劳动着，有的学生一次挑四筐土，手里还提一筐。被人们称做“小罗成”的交通部的工人张林，他在天寒地冻中干劲冲天，他说：“寒风怕什么，它越冷，我越热。”这个部水运设计院的女技术员刘泽英开始劳动时挑土不行，铲土也没有力气，经过几天锻炼，参加了青年突击队，什么活都能干了，人们都叫她是“女虎将”。建筑工程部第七批参加义务劳动的一百九十多人中，出现了一个先进中队，五个优胜小队，六个劳动模范和二十六个积极分子。
    很多人在义务劳动中提高了思想觉悟，改进了工作作风。冶金部设计人员李华如，通过一筐一铲的劳动，体会到祖国建设的艰辛，他保证今后在设计中绝不浪费国家一文钱。第二商业部安装公司干部李正洪在机关参加体力劳动时，说干电工眼睛不行，干管工嫌脏嫌累，经过义务劳动以后，他决心干管工了。北京市中医医院卫生员刘秀琴，过去贴大字报，责问领导上为什么让她当卫生员，在义务劳动回院后，她又贴出大字报，检查了自己轻视体力劳动的错误思想。
    义务劳动使领导与被领导、人与人之间的关系充满了团结、互助和友谊。很多部长、将军、局长、处长、经理等领导干部，也都和大家一起参加了义务劳动。公安部部长罗瑞卿、交通部部长王首道等利用假日到工地上和部里的同志共同挖土、抬土。人民解放军炮兵司令员陈锡联上将同炮兵司令部机关干部一起劳动了七天，和大家一起吃窝窝头，睡草铺。参加革命三十年的老红军黄文明少将，由于他劳动积极，并且给同志们打开水、打饭、扫地，被大家称为“好战士”、“好勤务员”。北京市人民委员会办公厅秘书管文熊过去上班来、下班走，对同志不关心。这次义务劳动，使他和很多同志建立起劳动友谊，回机关后还常和在一起劳动过的汽车司机王宝昌谈心。
    目前，爱劳动已经成为首都一种新的社会风气，到处都有义务劳动的人群。人们用义务劳动建造了东风湖、人定湖、红领巾水库、青年林、妇女林。许多大、中学校的学生利用假日到电影院、公园、商店等场所为观众、游人、顾客服务。有些机关已取消或减少了公务员，由干部自己打扫办公室。
