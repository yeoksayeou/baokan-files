Xinhua News Agency, Rome, May 24th: According to TASS, the Italian Communist Party held a mass rally in Rome on the 23rd—the last day of the Italian election campaign. Italian Communist Party General Secretary Togliatti explained the domestic political situation and international situation to the 250,000 people present, and reiterated the Italian Communist Party's election platform.

	When discussing the domestic political situation, Togliatti emphasized the undemocratic nature of the ruling Christian Democratic Party's domestic and foreign policies and the growing dissatisfaction of the broad masses with this policy. He pointed out that the Christian Democratic Party had not implemented the economic and social reforms stipulated in the constitution, nor had it solved important problems such as social welfare and cultural education. He pointed out that the leaders of the Christian Democratic Party are not only protectors of privileged monopoly groups, but have themselves become a new privileged class wielding exclusive power. The characteristics of this privileged class are tyranny, corruption, and indifference to national interests. He said that if the current situation is not changed, Italy will not be able to move forward.

	When discussing the international situation, Togliatti pointed out that American capitalism is sliding downhill into the abyss of crisis, and this crisis has now spread to Europe and Italy. In this case, American capitalism will inevitably try to implement more dangerous war provocation policies than before, while intensifying the exploitation of countries that are willing to accept its political and economic leadership.

	Togliatti said, we suggest that the Italian government take at least security measures. The first is not to allow the establishment of American atomic missile bases in Italy.

	Togliatti spoke about the Soviet Union's proposal to conclude a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with Italy. He said, "Concluding such a treaty is to realize the principle stipulated in the Italian constitution, that is, Italy refuses to use war as a means to solve outstanding international issues."

	Togliatti put forward the Italian Communist Party’s program at the meeting. This program stipulates profound economic, social and political reforms at home, and advocates pursuing an active policy conducive to easing international tensions in diplomacy. He said that this program can be realized through the cooperation of all democratic forces and people's forces based on the political unity of the Communist Party and the Socialist Party. He expressed disapproval of the movement against the so-called united front policy carried out by the leaders of the Socialist Party.

	Togliatti called on all citizens to vote for the Italian Communist Party.

    罗马二十五万群众在大选前夕集会
    陶里亚蒂阐述意共竞选纲领
    主张改革内政实行和平的外交政策
    据新华社25日讯　据塔斯社罗马24日讯：意大利共产党在23日——意大利竞选运动的最后一天在罗马举行了群众大会，意大利共产党总书记陶里亚蒂向到会的二十五万人说明国内的政治局势和国际形势，并且再次阐述了意大利共产党的竞选纲领。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到国内政治局势时着重指出了执政的天主教民主党的内政和外交政策的反民主性质和广大群众对这种政策不满情绪的增长，他指出，天主教民主党没有实现宪法规定的经济和社会改革，也没有解决社会福利和文化教育等等重要问题。他指出，天主教民主党的首领不仅是垄断的特权集团的保护者，而且他们本身也已经变成了独揽大权的新特权阶级。这个特权阶级的特点是专横、贪污、对民族利益漠不关心。他说，如果不改变目前的局面，意大利无法再向前迈进。
    陶里亚蒂在谈到国际局势时指出，美国资本主义正在沿着下坡路滑向危机的深渊，这个危机现在已经蔓延到欧洲和意大利。在这种情况下美国资本主义必然努力推行比到目前为止更加危险的战争挑衅政策，同时将加紧剥削那些甘愿接受它的政治和经济领导的国家。
    陶里亚蒂说，我们建议意大利政府采取起码的安全措施。首先是不能容许在意大利建立美国的原子导弹基地。
    陶里亚蒂谈到苏联提出的同意大利缔结友好和互不侵犯条约的建议，他说，“缔结这种条约就是实现意大利宪法中所规定的原则，即意大利拒绝用战争作为解决悬而未决的国际问题的手段。”
    陶里亚蒂在会上提出了意大利共产党的纲领，这个纲领规定在国内进行深刻的经济、社会和政治改革，在外交上主张奉行积极的有利于缓和国际紧张局势的政策。他说，这个纲领可以通过以共产党和社会党在政治上的团结为基础的一切民主力量和人民力量的合作来实现。他表示不赞成社会党领导人所进行的反对所谓统一战线政策的运动。
    陶里亚蒂号召全体公民投意大利共产党的票。
