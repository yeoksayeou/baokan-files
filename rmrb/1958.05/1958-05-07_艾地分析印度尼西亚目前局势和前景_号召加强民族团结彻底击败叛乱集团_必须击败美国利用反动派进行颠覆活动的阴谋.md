Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 6th. May: The "People's Daily" today published a speech delivered by Aidit, General Secretary of the Indonesian Communist Party, at the Communist Party headquarters on May 4th to commemorate "May Day". The speech analyzed the prospects for national unity in Indonesia after the failure of the rebel government.

Aidit said that from the objective situation and the wishes of the Indonesian people, after the failure of the rebel government, national unity and the position of the Djuanda Cabinet will be further consolidated, and the situation within the armed forces will improve, thereby providing the possibility of consolidating national independence and economic construction. On the other hand, the people will increasingly hate the policy of separatism; the "prestige" of imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and political parties that supported the rebel government will be greatly reduced.

Aidit said, however, that we know that foreign imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not give up on these things. After the failure of the "Revolutionary Government," the US imperialists are actively working to stir up political changes in Indonesia, which is certainly against the will of the Indonesian people.

He said that the US imperialists have the following plan: to replace the Djuanda Cabinet with a Masyumi Party-Islamic Teachers Association cabinet, and to place the Indonesian Nationalist Party and the Communist Party in the position of opposition parties. If this plan does not work, they will try to form a Masyumi Party-Islamic Teachers Association-Nationalist Party cabinet, with the Indonesian Communist Party as the opposition party. The US imperialists and their servants in Indonesia are conspiring to undermine the national unity of the Indonesian people through this method, and hope to restore the "prestige" of the Masyumi Party and the Socialist Party in this way, in order to strengthen their position in Indonesia.

In addition, the US imperialists will also try to make contact with military groups, including army personnel who are currently putting down the rebellion, in order to use military groups to force President Sukarno to agree to form the cabinet they desire.

Aidit said that if all this is realized, it will create conditions to suppress the development of nationalistic and progressive movements, expand the harassment activities of the Darul Islam army, and strengthen colonialism in West Irian.

Aidit said that he believes that all the political plans and blueprints of the US imperialists will meet with strong opposition from the Indonesian people and realistic Indonesian leaders, because this is a divisive plan that cannot achieve the domestic peace necessary to eliminate the Darul Islam army, put down foreign subversion, oppose foreign interference, and carry out economic construction.

Aidit said that we cannot ignore the fact that among those who are currently opposing the rebels, there are still some people who have the naive idea that after defeating the "Revolutionary Government," the reactionaries and the right wing have suffered a complete defeat. Therefore, they believe that national unity is no longer needed, and that uniting with the right wing to suppress the revolutionary movement has become an urgent task. Aidit said that this idea is completely contrary to reality. He said that although the rebel government has been defeated, it is still necessary to continue the struggle for the common goals of liberating West Irian, eliminating the Darul Islam army and foreign subversion, and carrying out domestic construction. Under the current circumstances, only the joint efforts of communists, patriotic nationalists, and religious figures can achieve these goals. Otherwise, Indonesia will become the fat meat coveted by imperialists and domestic reactionaries. Aidit said that, in general, after defeating the rebel government, what is needed even more is not the division of national forces, but national unity.

At the end of his speech, Aidit called on all the Indonesian people to strengthen the unity between workers and people of other classes, promote unity with the army and the government, in order to completely defeat the rebel group, smash the source of their strength, and defeat the political plans of the United States and their conspiracy to use figures in the Indonesian armed forces to put pressure on President Sukarno.

He pointed out that after the defeat of the rebel government, when the Djuanda cabinet continues to pursue a policy aimed at consolidating national independence and defending world peace, this cabinet should continue to be supported.

    艾地分析印度尼西亚目前局势和前景
    号召加强民族团结彻底击败叛乱集团
    必须击败美国利用反动派进行颠覆活动的阴谋
    新华社雅加达6日电　“人民日报”今天刊登了印度尼西亚共产党总书记艾地5月4日为纪念“五一”节在共产党总部发表的演说。演说分析了在印度尼西亚叛乱政府失败以后印度尼西亚全民团结的前景。
    艾地说，从客观形势和印度尼西亚人民的愿望来看，在叛乱政府失败后，全民团结和朱安达内阁的地位将更加巩固，武装部队内部的情况将会好起来，从而提供了巩固民族独立和经济建设的可能性。另一方面，人民将愈加痛恨分裂主义政策；支持叛乱政府的帝国主义、国内反动派和政党的“威望”将大大下降。
    艾地说，但是，我们知道，外国帝国主义分子和国内反动派对于这些是不会罢休的。美帝国主义者在“革命政府”失败以后，正在积极活动，以便在印度尼西亚煽起政治变动，这当然是违背印度尼西亚人民的意志的。
    他说，美帝国主义者有这样的方案：以马斯友美党—伊斯兰教师联合会的内阁来代替朱安达内阁，把印度尼西亚国民党和共产党置于反对党的地位。假如这种方案行不通的话，就设法成立马斯友美党—伊斯兰教师联合会—国民党内阁，把印度尼西亚共产党当做反对党。美帝国主义者和他们在印度尼西亚的奴仆阴谋通过这种办法来破坏印度尼西亚人民的全民团结，并且希望这样来恢复马斯友美党和社会党的“威信”，以便加强它们在印度尼西亚的地位。
    此外，美帝国主义者还会设法同军事集团，包括现在正在扑灭叛乱的陆军军人在内，进行接触，以便利用军事集团来逼迫苏加诺总统同意成立他们所希望的内阁。
    艾地说，假如这一切实现，就会创造一些条件，来镇压民族主义运动和进步运动的发展，扩大伊斯兰教军的骚扰活动和在西伊里安加强殖民主义。
    艾地说，他相信，美帝国主义者的一切政治方案和蓝图都会遇到印度尼西亚人民和现实的印度尼西亚领袖的大力反对，因为这是一种分裂主义的方案，不能实现为消灭伊斯兰教军、扑灭外国颠覆活动、反对外国干涉和进行经济建设所必需的国内和平。
    艾地说，我们也不能忽视，在现在反对叛乱分子的人们中间，还有一些人怀着天真的想法，以为在挫败“革命政府”以后，反动派和右翼就遭到了完全的失败。因此，他们认为不再需要全民团结了，而且认为，同右翼联合起来镇压革命运动已经成为迫切任务。艾地说，这种想法是完全违反现实的。他说，虽然叛乱政府已经被打垮了，仍然有必要为解放西伊里安、消灭伊斯兰教军及外国颠覆活动和进行国内建设的共同目标而继续进行斗争。在目前的情况下，只有共产党人、爱国的民族主义者和宗教界人士共同努力，才能实现这些目标。不然，印度尼西亚就会成为帝国主义者和国内反动派所垂涎的肥肉。艾地说，一般说来，在击败了叛乱政府以后，更加需要的不是民族力量的分裂，而是民族团结。
    艾地在演说结束时，号召全体印度尼西亚人民加强工人和其它阶层人民之间的团结，促进和陆军及政府的团结，以便彻底击败叛乱集团，粉碎他们力量的来源，击败美国的政治方案和他们企图利用印度尼西亚武装部队里的人物来向苏加诺总统施加压力的阴谋。
    他指出，在击败了叛乱政府以后，当朱安达内阁仍然奉行目的在于巩固民族独立和保卫世界和平政策的时候，这个内阁应当不断地得到支持。
