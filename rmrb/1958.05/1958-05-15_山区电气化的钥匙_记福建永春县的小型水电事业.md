The Key to Electrifying Mountainous Areas
　　——On the Small-Scale Hydropower Undertakings of Yongchun County, Fujian
　　Xie Sichun

"Electrifying mountainous areas" was something everyone thought was far off, and I was no exception. Recently, after visiting small-scale hydropower stations in Yongchun County, Fujian, I realized that this idea had suddenly become outdated and inappropriate.

Yongchun County started building its hydropower stations in 1956. After the upsurge of cooperativization in the winter of 1955, the county's cultivated area more than doubled. The spring plowing that year was very busy, and there was no capacity to process the large quantities of wheat and potato products, which was a serious problem. The county leaders decided to take advantage of the mountainous area's abundant water resources to build hydropower and water-powered stations.

When they started, the lack of technical expertise and funding were two major hurdles. They overcame the first hurdle by running training classes, sending people to study in other places, having old factories lead new factories, old workers lead new workers, and gathering existing technical personnel. They overcame the second hurdle by relying mainly on agricultural cooperatives, using diverse organizational forms, absorbing all possible funds, and having everyone work hard and build stations frugally. In this way, twenty-two hydropower and water-powered stations emerged in Yongchun in the past two years. Including those built before 1956, there are now a total of thirty-seven hydropower and water-powered stations.

Hydropower and water-powered stations are mainly used for processing agricultural and sideline products, followed by irrigation and lighting. In the processing of agricultural and sideline products alone, forty thousand man-days were saved last year.

Yongchun County's hydropower and water-powered stations are "small-scale oriented," the largest being sixty-four horsepower and the smallest only two horsepower. The two-horsepower station was built in ten days at a cost of one hundred and fifty yuan. When farmers requested a design, the technicians searched through books but couldn't find such a small power station, so they didn't dare to take it on. Later, a middle school teacher helped. Its intake channel is less than one meter wide, and the head is only one meter high. It drives a sweet potato grinding machine and ground more than 83,000 jin last autumn. Although the equipment is simple and unimpressive, it is very useful for a dozen or so mountain households.

In Yongchun, I took a trip to Peng'hu Town and Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative. There are six or seven hydropower and water-powered stations along the road from the county seat to Peng'hu, which is more than 20 kilometers away. As long as you see a new, independent house by the river, you don't need to ask, it must be one of them. The hydropower station run by Shuguang Agricultural Cooperative is forty-five horsepower, generating twenty kilowatts. It has one rice huller, one rice mill, and one flour mill, as well as a sawmill. At night, when these machines are shut down, the motor starts generating electricity to provide lighting for farmers' homes. On the night I stayed at Shuguang Cooperative, I visited farmers' homes, and every household was lit with electric lights, and the women were busy with housework. In a large hall, a large group of people were holding a meeting. I lived in the cooperative's office building, the night air was very fresh, and I could faintly hear the sound of the stream and the motor, echoing each other. Across the way, a little further away, the electric lights twinkled in the windows of the farmhouses.

Small-scale hydropower undertakings have brought profound changes to the rural areas of Yongchun. Now, 60% of the staple food no longer needs to be hulled or ground by hand. Manual grinding of wheat can only grind ten jin per worker, which is not enough for a large family to eat for a day. Now, put it on a flour mill, and you can grind one hundred and eighty jin in an hour. In the past, farmers didn't like to grow wheat and potato crops because processing was troublesome, but now they are reclaiming land to grow them. At the beginning of liberation, there was only one person in the whole county who understood hydropower station design, but now there are more than ten. After studying, electrician Zheng Sheng'bing has independently designed three hydropower stations, all of which meet the standards. Hundreds of young farmers have become technicians such as electricians. Some people originally thought that mountainous areas had no future and that socialism would not reach the mountainous areas. When they could no longer use bamboo strips for lighting at night and no longer use their feet to pound rice, they completely changed their minds.

Today, the impression of Yongchun is: the whole county is talking about hydropower stations. Whether in towns or villages, you can see everywhere the slogan "Achieve preliminary rural electrification in 1958!" Some farmers' door couplets have replaced the words related to cooperativization with the words related to electrification; the county farm tool factory is trial-producing electric farm tools to meet the new requirements of the countryside. The night I arrived in Yongchun, I met groups of young people on the street. I wondered if they were hydropower station training personnel. When I asked, it turned out to be true. There were six hundred and forty of them, including those from other counties. A huge electrification plan is being drawn up. In a plan written on March 8, I saw that the county will build a total of sixty-five hydropower and water-powered stations this year. In another document written on March 17, I saw that it had become sixty-five hydropower stations and sixty-five water-powered stations, a total of one hundred and thirty! When I left at the end of the month, people told me that the number had increased again.

"Go up another level!" "Make the river water benefit the people, let the machines listen to the call of electricity!" This is Yongchun's loudest slogan. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, they will realize: agricultural electrification, livestock breeding electrification, agricultural machinery repair and assembly electrification, rural small-scale industry, handicraft electrification, and residential lighting electrification.

The farmers of Yongchun wrote a poem praising the hydropower cause: The Tao River (Yongchun's main river) flows gurgling, the Tao Yuan (Yongchun's ancient name) is full of hydropower stations, mechanization can promote production, and electric lights at dusk compete with the sun. This "competing with the sun" electric light not only illuminates the hearts of Yongchun farmers, but also illuminates the bright future of mountainous areas across the country and guides the way to this future. When I was in Yongchun, I saw groups of visitors from other counties and even other provinces every day. Some of them even learned how to manufacture wooden water turbines. All hydropower stations in Yongchun are equipped with this type of water turbine, which is made on-site using pine and miscellaneous wood, costing one-tenth of the cost of iron ones and lasting for ten years. During my visit, I really wanted to tell readers across the country about the situation in Yongchun as soon as possible. I really wanted the visitors from other places to have representatives from my hometown of eastern Zhejiang, or that I could get a design drawing of the hydropower station and wooden water turbine and send it back to eastern Zhejiang, because it is the same as Yongchun, full of mountains and torrents.

　　山区电气化的钥匙
　　——记福建永春县的小型水电事业
　　谢泗春
    “山区电气化”大家都以为是遥远的事，我也不例外。最近在福建永春参观了小型水电站，我发觉这种想法突然成了老皇历，不适时了。
    永春县的水电站是1956年动手办的。1955年冬天合作化高潮后，全县的耕种面积扩大了一倍多。这年春耕很忙，大量的麦类与薯类产品没有能力去加工，事情很严重。县的领导就决定利用山区多水力这个有利条件，兴办水电、水力站。
    开始兴办的时候，缺乏技术力量和资金是两重难关。他们以开办训练班、派人去外地学习、老厂带新厂、老工人带新工人以及搜罗原有技术人材等办法渡过了第一关。以农业社为主、多种组织形式、吸收各种可能利用的资金、大家动手、勤俭建站等办法渡过了第二关。就这样，两年来永春出现了二十二个水电、水力站。加上1956年前建的，共有三十七个水电、水力站。
    水电、水力站主要用于农副产品加工，其次是灌溉与照明。仅农副产品加工一项，去年一年就省了四十万个人工。
    永春县的水电、水力站是以“小型为主”的，最大的六十四马力，最小的只有二马力。二马力的是在十天内花一百五十元建成的。当农民要求设计时，技术人员查遍了书籍，也找不到这么小的电站，就不敢应承，后来还是一位中学教师帮了忙。它的进水沟不到一公尺宽，水头只有一公尺高，带动一部磨薯机，去年秋后磨了八万三千多斤，虽然设备简陋，貌不惊人，但对十来户的山村，却很顶事。
    在永春，我到蓬壶镇和曙光农业社跑了一趟。从县城到蓬壶二十多公里，沿公路就有六、七个水电、水力站，只要你看到临河有一所独立的新房子，不用问，它准是。曙光农业社办的水电站是四十五马力，发电二十瓩，有砻谷机、碾米机、磨粉机各一部，还有一部锯木机。晚上，这些机器停掉，马达开始发电，供农户照明。在曙光社留宿那天晚上，我到农民家去串门，家家户户亮着电灯，妇女在忙家务。在一所大厅里，一大堆人在开会。我住在社的办公楼上，夜气很清新，外面隐隐传来溪水声与马达声，交相应和。对面稍远处，农家的窗户中电灯点点。
    小型水电事业给永春农村带来了深刻的变化。现在，60％的口粮已不用人力去脱壳或磨细。人工磨麦一工只能磨十斤，大户人家不够一天吃的。如今放上磨粉机，一小时就能磨一百八十斤。过去农民不喜欢种麦薯两类作物，因为加工麻烦，现在是垦地开荒来种了。解放初，懂水电站设计的全县只有一人，现在已有十多人。电工郑声禀学习后，已独立设计了三个水电站，都合标准。几百青年农民成了电工等技术工人。原来有些人认为山区没有前途，社会主义到不了山区，当他们夜间可以不再用竹片照明、舂米可以不再用两脚时，就完全改变了想法。
    今天，永春给人们的印象是：满县争说水电站。无论在城镇或乡村，到处可以看到“1958年实现农村初步电气化！”这个标语；农民的门联，有的已将有关合作化的字眼换成了电气化的字眼；县农具厂正在试制电动农具，以适应农村的新要求。我到永春那晚，在街上碰到一群群青年，我想会不会是水电站人员训练班，一问，果然是。他们连同外县来的共有六百四十多人。一个庞大的电气化规划正在制订，在一份3月8日写的规划上，我看到今年全县将兴建水电、水力站共六十五个，在同月17日写的另一份东西中，我看到变成了水电站与水力站各六十五个，共一百三十个！月底我离开时，人们告诉我这个数字又增加了。
    “更上一层楼！”“使河水为人民造福，让机器听电力呼唤！”这是永春最响亮的口号。第二个五年计划期内，他们将实现：农业电气化、畜牧饲养电气化、农械修配电气化、农村小型工业、手工业电气化、生活照明电气化。
    永春农民作了首歌颂水电事业的诗：桃溪（永春的主要河流）流水响潺潺，桃源（永春古称）林立水电站，机械化能促生产，黄昏电灯赛太阳。这个“赛太阳”的电灯不仅照亮了永春农民的心，同时也照见了全国山区美好的前途与导向这个前途的道路。我在永春时，每天看到外县甚至外省来的成群结队的参观者，他们有的还连带学习木质水轮机的制造。永春所有水电站都是用这种水轮机装备的，它就地利用松杂木制成，成本为铁质的十分之一，可用十年。我在参观中，真想早日把永春的情况早日告诉全国读者，真想在外地的参观者中有我故乡浙东的代表，或者我能弄到一份水电站与木质水轮机的设计图寄回浙东去，因为那里跟永春一样，也处处是山，处处是激湍清流。
