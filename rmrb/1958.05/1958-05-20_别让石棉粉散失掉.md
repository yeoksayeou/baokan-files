    Don't Let Asbestos Powder Be Lost
    All asbestos factories in the country use cotton bags to pack asbestos powder. Because cotton bags are not strong, some bags are damaged during transportation, causing a large amount of asbestos powder to be lost, which wastes valuable building materials.
    Using cotton cloth to pack asbestos powder is neither economical nor strong. I suggest using burlap sacks or straw bags as packaging bags, which are both economical and durable, and can also save a lot of cotton cloth. I hope all asbestos factories will consider adopting this.

    别让石棉粉散失掉
    全国各石棉厂都用棉布袋装石棉粉，因为棉布袋不结实，在转运过程中，部分袋子坏了，使石棉粉大量散失，浪费了宝贵的建筑材料。
    用棉布装石棉粉既不经济，又不结实。我建议改用麻袋或草袋子做包装口袋，这样既经济又耐用，还可以节省大量棉布。希望各石棉厂考虑采用。
