    The studious and tireless Newton
    Newton, who discovered the law of universal gravitation, was born into a peasant family in England. His father died shortly before he was born. Due to poverty, Newton dropped out of school and worked as a farmer.
    From a young age, Newton loved to read and ponder problems. When he went to the market as a farmer to sell goods, he would sit under the fence, engrossed in reading, and as a result, his business suffered. He also once stood alone in a storm, walking both with and against the wind, using the difference in speed to study the force of the wind. This happened when he was sixteen years old. Newton was only thirty years old when he finally discovered the law of universal gravitation.
    There is a story about Newton's focus on his research: Once, Newton invited a friend to his house for dinner. The dishes had been on the table for a long time, but Newton remained in his study. His friend, afraid of disturbing his work, ate some of the food on the table and left. Later, Newton came out, saw the bones left by his friend, and said, "So I have already eaten! I thought I hadn't eaten yet!"

    好学不倦的牛顿
    发现万有引力的牛顿，出身在英国一个农民的家庭。他出生前不久，父亲就死了。由于家里贫穷，牛顿曾经失过学和当过农民。
    牛顿从小就爱读书和思索问题。当他作农民去赶集卖东西的时候，他却坐在篱笆下津津有味地读书，结果生意也没作好。他还曾经独自在一次暴风中，一会儿顺着风走，一会儿逆着风走，用相差的速度来研究风力。这是他十六岁时候的事。牛顿最后研究出万有引力定律的时候，也不过三十岁。
    有这么一个关于牛顿专心研究的故事：有一次，牛顿请一位朋友到他家吃饭，菜摆在桌上很久了，可是牛顿始终在他的研究室里不出来。他的朋友怕打扰了他的工作，便把桌上的菜吃了一些走了。后来牛顿出来，看见他朋友吃剩下的骨头，便说：“原来我已经吃过饭了，我还以为没有吃呢！”
