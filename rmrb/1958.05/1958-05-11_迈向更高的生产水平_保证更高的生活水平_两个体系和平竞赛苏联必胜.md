　　Strive for Higher Production Levels, Guarantee Higher Living Standards
　　The Soviet Union Will Win the Peaceful Competition Between Two Systems
    Khrushchev said: All kinds of traitors, revisionists, and reformists viciously attack the Soviet Union and socialism, but they cannot stop the Soviet people and the Communist Party from advancing along the great path of Lenin!
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 10th: TASS reported from Moscow on May 10th that First Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU Khrushchev, in a report to the plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU held on the 6th and 7th, said that the Soviet Union must mobilize all its forces to win the peaceful competition between the two systems. The means to achieve this goal are our organization and unity, higher production levels and the production of abundant material resources, in order to guarantee higher living standards for all working people.
    Khrushchev said that the enemies of socialism shout and clamor to mock us, saying that the Soviet Union pays little attention to the production of consumer goods and little attention to improving life. Those imperialist lackeys who specialize in praising the “wonderful” lifestyle of capitalist society and spreading slander against socialism try their best to curse us. Those various traitors, revisionists, and reformists viciously attack the Soviet Union and Soviet policies. They call themselves the protectors of the working class, and even the leaders of the working class, but in essence, they are agents of capitalism. Those fake socialists attack socialism, obliterate the true achievements of socialism, fabricate all kinds of slanders about socialist countries, prettify modern capitalism, suppress the revolutionary forces of the working class, paralyze the class sensitivity of the working class, and stop their efforts in class struggle, thereby benefiting capitalism.
    Khrushchev continued, despite the enemies using all these slanders, lies, and vicious attacks, the Soviet people and our Communist Party have always been confidently advancing along the path pointed out by the great Lenin.
    The plenary session of the Central Committee of the CPSU this time discussed the issue of accelerating the development of the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic materials. Khrushchev made a report on this issue at the meeting. In his report, he pointed out that in order to further rapidly develop the Soviet economy and strive for technological progress, and in order to complete the task of increasing the production of daily necessities, it is necessary to accelerate the development of the chemical industry.
    The Soviet Union will allocate more than one hundred billion rubles for the development of the chemical industry in the next few years. He said that considering the simultaneous development of other sectors of the national economy and the priority development of heavy industry, allocating such a large amount of funds to develop the chemical industry specifically demonstrates the Soviet Union's strong economic strength.
    Khrushchev said that according to preliminary calculations, by 1965, the output of major chemical products and automobile tires will increase to about twice that of 1958, synthetic rubber will increase to more than two and a half times, and it is planned to increase the production capacity of man-made and synthetic fibers to 4.6 times, and the production capacity of plastics and synthetic resins to 8 times. In order to achieve these goals, 257 new chemical industrial enterprises are planned to be built and renovated during this period, 14 new factories for manufacturing chemical industrial equipment will be built and put into production, and 42 chemical machine manufacturing factories will be built and renovated, etc.
    Several existing machine manufacturing factories will specialize in the production of machines for the chemical industry and will utilize the production capacity of the defense industry in this regard.
    When talking about the geographical distribution of the chemical industry, Khrushchev pointed out that many large projects will be built in the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan, and other union republics.
    Khrushchev said that now, the Soviet Union's chemical production ranks second in the world, second only to the United States. In terms of the development speed of the chemical industry, the Soviet Union has surpassed the industrialized capitalist countries. In 1956, the Soviet Union's chemical production increased sixfold compared to 1937, while the United States only increased 3.1 times, the United Kingdom increased twofold, France increased 1.3 times, and West Germany increased 1.1 times. In the production of man-made fibers, synthetic fibers, plastics, and other synthetic materials, the Soviet Union is still behind some capitalist countries. Therefore, the issue of developing the production of synthetic materials and their products is of particular significance in all major issues of developing the chemical industry.
    Khrushchev said that now a most important and urgent task is put forward—to ensure the accelerated development of the chemical industry in a short period of time, and to establish a strong polymer production industry. He emphasized that this issue has great national significance and political significance under the current conditions.
    Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union has the necessary conditions to accelerate the development of the chemical industry. In 1958, the Soviet Union will produce more than 9 billion cubic meters of natural gas. With so much natural gas, about 400,000 tons of polyethylene (about one and a half times the output of the United States last year) and more than 500,000 tons of synthetic rubber can be produced. The proven reserves of phosphate mines in the Soviet Union are 3 billion tons, while the total reserves in the world (excluding the Soviet Union) are 6 billion tons. The Soviet Union's reserves of potash and natural sulfur rank first in the world.
    Khrushchev said that developing the production of synthetic materials is a very important and completely new direction in the Soviet Union's economic development, which will promote the technological progress of the national economy and the further improvement of the welfare of the working people.
    In his report, Khrushchev pointed out that further developing the economies of socialist countries is a major aspect of the struggle against capitalism. He emphasized that the current struggle between labor and capital, the struggle between socialism and capitalism, is at such a stage that the balance of power between them will be resolved in peaceful competition. At present, there are many socialist countries in the world with nearly one billion people, so the possibility of the rapid development of socialism has greatly increased.
    At present, the Soviet Union has far exceeded the most developed capitalist countries in terms of industrial output, and is only behind the United States. From 1953 to 1957, the Soviet Union surpassed the United States in terms of the growth rate and output growth of iron ore, coal, oil, pig iron, steel, cement, and wool fabrics. For example, during this period, the annual growth rate of steel production in the Soviet Union averaged 7.6%, while the United States was 0.2%. The absolute growth rate of steel production in the Soviet Union was 3.2%, while the United States was 0.3%.
    Khrushchev said that recently, the production in the United States has experienced a sharp decline, and now it seems that this decline has exceeded the previous declines in the post-war period.
    Khrushchev pointed out that in 1957, the industrial output of socialist countries increased three and a half times compared to the 1937 production level. He pointed out that twenty years ago, the Soviet Union was the only socialist country. Now socialist countries have formed a system. If we compare the total industrial output of the socialist system with the Soviet Union twenty years ago, it has increased nearly eight times, while the industry of the capitalist system has only increased twofold.
    Khrushchev said that the sharp decline in the Soviet Union's mortality rate and the extension of life expectancy are the most eloquent proof of the improvement of people's welfare. Now, the Soviet Union has the lowest mortality rate in the world. The average life expectancy of Soviet people has more than doubled compared to pre-revolutionary Russia. The mortality rate has decreased by three-quarters, and the infant mortality rate has decreased by more than six-fifths.
    Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union's long-term plan for developing the national economy from 1959 to 1965 will soon be studied and adopted. The completion of this plan will enable the Soviet Union to closely approach the solution of the main economic task—catching up with and surpassing the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita output in the shortest historical period. Khrushchev said that in order to make socialist ideas penetrate the hearts of people in capitalist countries faster, we must mobilize all our forces to more fully demonstrate the superiority of socialism over capitalism in the peaceful competition between the two systems. To win the competition between the two systems, we should catch up with and surpass the United States in terms of per capita production. In the competition with capitalism, we can and will inevitably break through this barrier, but the means to achieve this goal are not ballistic missiles, atomic bombs, and hydrogen bombs, but our organization and unity, higher production levels and the production of abundant material resources, in order to guarantee higher living standards for all working people.
    Khrushchev pointed out that after reaching the production level of the most developed capitalist country, the United States, the Soviet Union will not stop there, but will move forward faster.

　　迈向更高的生产水平　保证更高的生活水平
　　两个体系和平竞赛苏联必胜
    赫鲁晓夫说：形形色色的叛徒、修正主义者、改良主义者恶毒地攻击苏联和社会主义，阻挡不了苏联人民和共产党沿着伟大的列宁的道路前进！
    新华社10日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科10日讯：苏共中央第一书记赫鲁晓夫在6日到7日举行的苏共中央全会上作报告时说，苏联要动员一切力量，在两个体系的和平竞赛中取得胜利。达到这个目的的手段是我们的组织性和团结一致，更高的生产水平和生产丰富的物质资料，借以保证全体劳动人民达到更高的生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫说，社会主义的敌人大叫大喊地嘲笑我们说，苏联很少注意生产消费品，很少注意改善生活。那些专门颂扬资本主义社会生活方式的“美妙”和散布诽谤社会主义的谰言的帝国主义奴才们千方百计咒骂我们。那些形形色色的叛徒、修正主义者和改良主义者恶毒地攻击苏联和苏联的政策，他们自称为工人阶级的保护人，甚至自称为工人阶级的领袖，而实质上是资本主义的代理人。那些冒牌的社会主义者抨击社会主义，抹杀社会主义的真正成就，编造各种各样关于社会主义国家的谰言，粉饰现代资本主义，拑制工人阶级的革命力量，麻痹工人阶级的阶级敏感，制止他们阶级斗争的努力，从而有利于资本主义。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，尽管敌人利用了这一切诽谤谎言和恶毒的攻击，苏联人民和我们共产党始终满怀信心地沿着伟大的列宁指出的道路前进。
    苏共中央这次全会讨论了加速发展化学工业、特别是合成物质及其制品生产的问题。赫鲁晓夫在会上就这个问题作了报告。他在报告中指出，为了进一步迅速发展苏联的经济和争取技术进步，为了完成增产日用品的任务，必须加速发展化学工业。
    苏联在最近几年内将拨出一千多亿卢布供发展化学工业之用。他说，考虑到国民经济其他部门的同时发展以及重工业的优先发展，拨出这样大量的资金来发展化学工业，就具体地表明了苏联雄厚的经济实力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，根据初步计算，到1965年，主要化学产品和汽车轮胎的产量约将增加到1958年的两倍，合成橡胶将增加到两倍半以上，计划把人造纤维和合成纤维的生产能力增加到四点六倍，塑料和合成树脂的生产能力增加到八倍。为了达到这些目标，准备在这个期间新建和改建二百五十七个化学工业企业，新建十四个制造化学工业设备的工厂并投入生产，建成并改建四十二个化学机器制造工厂等等。
    若干现有的机器制造厂将专门生产化学工业用机器，并且在这方面利用国防工业的生产能力。
    在谈到化学工业的地理分布时，赫鲁晓夫指出，很多大的工程项目将建设在俄罗斯联邦、乌克兰、阿塞拜疆和乌兹别克等加盟共和国。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在，苏联的化学品生产占世界第二位，仅次于美国。按化学工业的发展速度来说，苏联超过了工业发达的资本主义国家。1956年苏联化学品生产量比1937年增加了六倍，而美国只增加了三点一倍，英国增加了两倍，法国增加一点三倍，西德增加一点一倍。在人造纤维、合成纤维、塑料和其他合成物质的生产方面，苏联仍然落后于某些资本主义国家。因此，发展合成物质及其制品的生产的问题在发展化学工业的一切重大问题中具有特别意义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，现在提出一个最重要和迫切的任务——在短时期内保证加速发展化学工业，并且建立强大的聚合物生产工业。他强调指出，这个问题在当前条件下具有巨大的全国意义和政治意义。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联拥有加速发展化学工业的必要条件。1958年苏联将生产出九十多亿立方公尺的天然气。用这么多的天然气可以生产出大约四十万吨的聚乙烯（约相当于美国去年产量的一倍半），五十多万吨合成橡胶。苏联已经查明的磷酸盐矿的蕴藏量为三十亿吨，而全世界（苏联除外）的总蕴藏量为六十亿吨。苏联的钾盐和天然硫的蕴藏量占世界第一位。
    赫鲁晓夫说，发展合成物质的生产是苏联经济发展中的十分重要的和完全新的方向，这将促进国民经济的技术进步和劳动人民福利的进一步提高。
    赫鲁晓夫在报告中指出进一步发展社会主义国家的经济是同资本主义斗争的一个主要方面。他强调说，目前劳动和资本的斗争，社会主义和资本主义的斗争正处在这样一个阶段，就是它们之间力量的对比要在和平竞赛中来解决。目前，世界上存在着将近十亿人口的很多个社会主义国家，这样，社会主义飞跃发展的可能性就大大地增加了。
    目前苏联在工业产量方面已远远地超过了最发达的资本主义国家，而仅落后于美国。从1953到1957年，苏联在铁矿砂、煤、石油、生铁、钢、水泥、毛织品的增长速度和产量增长额方面都超过了美国。例如，这一时期苏联钢产量的每年增长速度平均为7.6％，而美国为0.2％。苏联钢产量的绝对增长率为3.2％，美国为0.3％。
    赫鲁晓夫说，近来美国的生产发生剧烈的衰退，现在看来这次衰退已经超过了战后时期的历次衰退。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，1957年社会主义国家的工业产量比1937年的生产水平增加了三倍半，他指出，二十年前苏联是唯一的社会主义国家，现在社会主义国家已经组成了一个体系，如果拿社会主义体系的工业总产量同二十年前的苏联相比则增长了将近八倍。而资本主义体系的工业仅仅增加了一倍。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人口死亡率的急剧下降和寿命的延长是人民福利改善的一个最雄辩的证明。现在，苏联的人口死亡率是世界上最低的。苏联人的平均寿命比革命前俄国增加了一倍多。人口死亡率减少了四分之三，其中儿童死亡率减少了六分之五以上。
    赫鲁晓夫说，不久就要研究并通过1959—1965年苏联发展国民经济的远景计划。完成这个计划就使苏联紧紧接近于解决主要的经济任务——在最短历史期内在按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家。赫鲁晓夫说，为了使社会主义思想更快地深入资本主义国家的人心，我们要动员一切力量以便在两个体系的和平竞赛中更充分地证明社会主义对资本主义的优越性。要在两个体系的竞赛中取得胜利，我们就应该在按人口计算的生产方面赶上和超过美国。在同资本主义的竞赛中我们可能并且必然会突破这一关，不过达到这个目的的手段不是弹道火箭，不是原子弹和氢弹，而是我们的组织性和团结一致，更高的生产水平和生产丰富的物质资料，借以保证全体劳动人民达到更高的生活水平。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，在达到了最发达的资本主义国家美国的生产水平以后，苏联并不会停留下来，还要更快地前进。
