    Write More Good Poems for Children
    ——Preface to "Poems for Children"
  　Zang Kejia
    "June 1st" Children's Day is coming soon, so let's present this collection of poems as a gift to children across the country.
    This collection includes more than forty poems, all products of poets and writers from the past two years. This is a selection from many creations.
    These dozens of poems express various aspects of life and create some character images, with many works using children's lives as their subject matter. The poets used high enthusiasm to praise the October Revolution, Sino-Soviet friendship, and artificial satellites; they used indignant verses to describe the tragic fate of American children.
    These poems unfold a fresh world before the children. Beautiful imaginations carry little hearts flying to Mars, all over the motherland, to the Soviet Union, and to the world of fairy tales.
    I think that after reading these poems, children will widen their eyes in surprise at flying to Mars; they will be intoxicated by the socialist beauty of the motherland; they will be moved by the noble qualities of some characters; they will shed tears for the plight of children in imperialist countries, feeling injustice...
    I believe that this is a beneficial gift for children. Giving you a bag of candy will only make you feel sweet for a while after eating it; giving you a toy will only make you bored after playing with it for a while. Giving you this collection of poems is different. After reading it, it will leave a deep impression on you, and it will make you understand more things. If it has the charm to make children want to read it again and again, and even be able to memorize it, that would be even better.
    The authors of this collection are mostly well-known poets and children's literature writers, each with their own style. In terms of form, there are metrical poems, folk song poems, and prose poems. Children, you can read them according to your own preferences. You are their loyal readers, and also the best connoisseurs and critics.
    In recent years, the output of children's literature has not been large. Two years ago, the Central Committee called on us to write more for children, and the "People's Daily" even published an editorial specifically for this purpose. The writers were invigorated and regarded the creation of children's literature as their bounden duty. In the past two years, the number of works has increased, and those who had not written for children in the past have also enthusiastically responded to the call of the Central Committee and started writing. In the children's poetry creation team, we have veteran poets and young children's poetry experts. We have also made a lot of gains. This collection of poems is one of them.
    However, we must add that children's poetry is still far from meeting the requirements of the thousands upon thousands of children who are eager for it. After reading this collection of poems, as one of its authors, I feel a bit insufficient. Generally speaking, the themes written by the poets are still relatively narrow. Real life is so rich and colorful, with so many moving stories, and how attractive they are to children. These are rarely reflected in this book. I think that the scope of children's poetry should be broad, and it should not be limited to writing about children in a small circle. We should use poetry to unfold various life situations for them, so that they can understand it and love it. During the socialist Great Leap Forward, children are also leaping forward. I have seen Young Pioneers of thirteen or fourteen years old digging mud and carrying soil in water conservancy projects; I have seen children of six or seven years old automatically organizing "four pests elimination groups", secretly cleaning the toilets every morning, fearing that adults will find out... Children have a strong interest in various movements and diverse lives. I think they must also like to read poems that reflect the construction of the motherland and major world events. Unfortunately, we cannot yet satisfy them.
    Poems for children to read must have characteristics in terms of expression. Otherwise, there is no difference from general poetry creation. Children's intelligence is still developing, their literary cultivation is relatively shallow, and what they like to see and hear is simple and bright folk song-style poetry that is easy to read and catchy. Poems that are too profound or scattered and lengthy are not suitable for children's tastes.
    In this collection, some poems are not specifically written for children to read, but of course, children can also understand them. I think children will definitely prefer poems written specifically for them. Such poems can be written about children themselves; but more importantly, they should be promoted to write about topics that children are willing to know or that are attractive and educational to them. Children like poems with strong stories, vivid images, and lively and rhythmic language. Children's poems must have the power to move children. This is not just about making them able to understand after reading the verses. This is related to the problem of the poet combining with reality, the problem of communication between the poet and the child's mind, and also the problem of the poet's artistic accomplishment. Writing poems for children is a meaningful work, a joyful work, and also a difficult work. To write works that are loved by children, you must first understand what they love. To have your singing touch children, you must first understand children's psychology and emotions. This requires living with them, being connected with them in heart and emotion, and resonating with each other.
    To write poems for children, the poet himself must have a "childlike heart."
    To write good poems for children, poems with high artistic level. Simply using some simple words to explain some educational clauses will not have much effect. Children's poems must first move children, and make them gain something and improve spiritually.
    I hope that the authors of children's poetry will create more excellent poems for children, so that they will not only be printed in books, but also be recited by thousands of children.
    This Children's Day, we give this collection of poems to the children as a gift, hoping that next year's gifts will be richer and heavier.

### 多给孩子们写些好诗——序“为孩子们写的诗”

    多给孩子们写些好诗
    ——序“为孩子们写的诗”
  　臧克家
    “六一”儿童节快要到了，我们就把这本诗集作为一份礼物，送给全国的小朋友们吧。
    这本诗集，一共收了四十几首诗，全是近两年多来诗人和作家们的产品。这是从许多的创作里挑选出来的一部分。
    这几十首诗，表现了各种各样的生活，塑造了一些人物形象，其中不少作品就以儿童生活作为题材。诗人们，用了高度热情歌颂了十月革命、中苏友谊和人造卫星；用了愤慨的诗句，描写了美国儿童悲惨的命运。
    这些诗，在小朋友们面前展开了一个新鲜的世界。美丽的想像带着一颗颗小心飞上了火星，飞遍了祖国，飞到了苏联，飞到了童话世界里去。
    我想，小朋友们读了这些诗，会为飞上火星惊奇地瞪大眼睛；会为祖国的社会主义美景所陶醉；会为一些人物的高尚品质所感动；会为帝国主义国家的儿童们的遭遇流泪，不平……。
    我相信，对于小朋友们，这是一份有益的礼物。送给你们一包糖，吃过后，只甜一阵子；送给你们一件玩具，玩一阵子也就腻了。送给你们这一本诗集，情况就不一样。读过以后，它会给你们留下很深的印象，它会使你们懂得更多的东西。如果它有魅力使小朋友们念一遍还想再念一遍，一直能够背诵下来，那就更好了。
    这本诗集的作者，多半是知名的诗人和儿童文学作家，各人都有自己的风格。在形式方面，有格律体、民歌体，也有散文诗。小朋友们，你们各人就凭着自己的喜爱去读它们吧。你们是它们忠实的读者，同时也是最好的鉴赏家和批评家。
    这些年来，儿童文学的作品，产量不多。二年前，中央号召我们多为孩子们写东西，“人民日报”为了这还特别发表了社论。作家们振奋了，把创作儿童文学作品看成自己的义不容辞的责任。这二年，作品多起来了，过去没有为儿童写过东西的，也热情地响应中央的号召动手写起来了。在儿童诗歌创作队伍里，我们有前辈诗人和青年儿童诗歌专家。我们也已经有了不少的收获。这本诗集，就是其中的一份。
    可是，我们必须跟上一句，儿童诗歌还是远远不能够满足千千万万如饥似渴的小朋友们的要求。读完了这本诗集以后，作为它的作者之一，我觉得有点不足。总的说来，诗人们所写的题材，范围还是比较窄狭。现实生活是多么丰富多彩，其中有多少动人的故事，它们对于孩子们又是多么富于吸引力呵。这一些，在这本诗里很少得到反映。我觉得，儿童诗的范围应该是宽广的，不能把它限制在写儿童的小圈子里。我们应该用诗歌给他们展开各种生活的情景，使他们了解它，热爱它。在社会主义大跃进的时候，儿童们也在跃进。我看到过十三四岁的少先队员，在水库工程中挖泥挑土；我看到过六七岁的小孩子们，自动的组织“除四害小组”，每天早晨偷偷的把厕所打扫得干干净净，怕大人发现……。孩子们对各种运动、多种多样的生活有着浓厚的兴趣。我想，他们也一定喜欢读到反映祖国建设和世界重大事件的诗歌。可惜，我们还不能够满足他们。
    写给孩子们念的诗歌，在表现手法上，是要有特点的。不然就和一般诗创作没有分别了。孩子们的智力还在发展中，他们的文艺修养也比较浅，他们所喜见乐闻的是朴素明快读起来朗朗上口的民歌体的诗。过于深奥或散漫、冗长的诗，都是不适合小朋友们的口味的。
    这集子里，有些诗，不是专门写给儿童读的，当然，儿童也可以读懂它们。我想儿童们一定更喜欢专为他们写的诗歌。这样的诗歌，可以写儿童本身；但更要推广开来，写儿童所愿意知道或对他们有吸引力和教育意义的题材。儿童们喜欢故事性强的，形象鲜明的，语言活泼生动、节奏明快的诗歌。儿童诗，对儿童必须有感动力量。这不是仅仅在诗句方面叫他们读了能懂就办到的。这联系到诗人和现实结合的问题，诗人和儿童心灵沟通的问题，也关系着诗人的艺术修养问题。给儿童写诗歌，是一件有意义的工作，是一件快乐的工作，同时也是一件艰难的工作。要写出来的作品为儿童所喜爱，首先得了解他们喜爱什么。要自己的歌声打动儿童，必须先了解儿童的心理和情感。这要和他们生活在一起，心灵上，情感上一脉相通，起着共鸣。
    给孩子们写诗，诗人自己要有一颗“赤子之心”。
    要给孩子们写好诗，艺术水平高的诗。仅仅用一些浅显字句去说明一些教育条文，是起不了多大作用的。儿童诗，首先必须叫儿童受到感动，精神上有所获得，有所提高。
    盼望儿童诗歌的作者们，多多为孩子们创作优秀的诗歌出来，使它们不但印在书本上，还传诵在千千万万儿童的口头上。
    今年儿童节，我们赠给小朋友们这一本诗集作为礼物，希望来年的赠品更加丰富，更加厚重一些。
