Two Topics on Breaking Superstition

　　The Story of "Bian He Presenting the Jade"

　　In the Peking Opera "Generals and Ministers in Reconciliation," which we often see, there is mention of the famous "He Shi Bi" jade. This jade has a very interesting origin.

　　Historically, it is written: "Bian He of Chu obtained a jade in the rough and presented it to King Li of Chu. The king ordered a jade craftsman to examine it, who said, 'It is a stone.' The king considered He a fraud and cut off his left foot. When King Wu ascended the throne, He presented it again. The jade craftsman again said, 'It is a stone.' The king again considered it a fraud and cut off his right foot. When King Wen ascended the throne, He embraced the jade in the rough and wept at the foot of Jing Mountain. The king sent someone to ask him, saying, 'I am not grieving over the amputation; it is because a precious jade is labeled as a stone, and a loyal man is called a liar, that I am grieving!' The king then sent someone to work on the jade in the rough, and indeed, jade was found."

　　Later, this jade was acquired by the King of Zhao, which then led to the story of Lin Xiangru "Returning the Jade Intact to Zhao."

　　Why bring up this ancient story? Because when beautiful jade is hidden inside a stone, it is not easily discovered. Even if it is discovered and presented, it is easily looked down upon by those "jade craftsmen," who not only do not accept it but also accuse the presenter of falsehood and inflict punishment. Therefore, Bian He's statement, "a loyal man is called a liar," is worthy of our deep consideration.

　　In the wisdom of the people, there are countless jades in the rough, but most of them appear to be merely stones on the surface. Before the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, weren't there many rationalization proposals and seeds of technological revolution that were looked down upon and suppressed by those self-righteous "jade craftsmen"?

　　Those "jade craftsmen" under King Li and King Wu were clearly the jade appraisal "experts" of the time, but their appraisal level and technical level seem to be far inferior to Bian He's. Therefore, we can draw a lesson: to obtain jade from the rough, we must first break down the superstition of experts.

　　The Kindred of Chicken Crows and Dog Thieves

　　There is a historical story like this:

　　Lord Mengchang entered Qin, and the King of Qin made him the Prime Minister. Someone slandered him, and the King of Qin imprisoned Lord Mengchang, intending to kill him. "Lord Mengchang sent someone to seek help from the King of Qin's favorite concubine. The concubine said, 'I desire the Lord's fox-fur coat with white fur.' Lord Mengchang had a fox-fur coat with white fur, but he had already presented it to the King of Qin and had nothing to give the concubine. Among his retainers was someone skilled in thievery like a dog, who entered the Qin treasury and stole the fox-fur coat with white fur to present to the concubine. The concubine then spoke on his behalf to the king and he was released. The king regretted it and sent people to chase him. Lord Mengchang reached the pass. According to the laws of the pass, travelers could only leave when the rooster crowed. It was still early, and the pursuers were about to arrive. Among his retainers was someone skilled in imitating a rooster crow, and the wild roosters heard it and all crowed. Lord Mengchang was then able to escape and return."

　　Lord Mengchang had three thousand retainers under his roof. Among them, of course, were many high-level intellectuals. Therefore, those who were akin to chicken crows and dog thieves were unlikely to be valued too much normally, nor could they display their talents. But when an emergency arose, when those intellectuals with lofty hats and wide belts were at a loss, those nameless individuals with a special skill, who had lower status and less learning, greatly displayed their power.

　　True knowledge, truly useful knowledge and methods, are often hidden in the bodies of ordinary people with low status. This story can also make people break down the superstition of scholars and experts.

    破除迷信二题
  　韦群
    “卞和献璞”的故事
    我们经常看到的京剧“将相和”里面，提到那块有名的“和氏璧”，这块璧，有一段很有意思的来历。
    历史上是这样写着的：“楚人卞和得玉璞，献之楚厉王，王使玉人视之，曰：‘石也’；王以和为诈，刖其左足。及武王立，和又献之，玉人又曰：‘石也’；王又以为诈而刖其右足。及文王立，和乃抱璞而泣于荆山之下，王使人问之，曰：‘臣非悲刖；宝玉而题之以石，贞士而名之为诳，所以悲也！’王乃使人理其璞，果得玉焉。”
    这块玉后来为赵王所得，于是又引起了蔺相如“完璧归赵”的故事。
    为什么要提起这个古老的故事？因为美玉被包藏在石头里面的时候，不容易被人发见，发见了而献上去，又容易被那些“玉人”看不起，不仅不接受，而且要说他造诳，加以刑戮，因此，卞和所说的“贞士而名之为诳”，很值得我们深思。
    在人民群众的智慧中，有无数的璧，不过其中的大多数，表面上看来不过是石头而已，在整风双反之前，不是也有许多合理化建议和技术革命的萌芽，被自以为是的“玉人”们看不起，而受到了打击和压制么？
    厉王和武王下面的那些“玉人”，分明是当时的理玉“专家”，可是他们的鉴定水平和技术水平，看来是远远不及卞和的。因此，我们可以得到一条教训：就是要从璞中得玉，首先要破除对专家的迷信。
    鸡鸣狗盗之辈
    历史上有过这么一段故事：
    孟尝君入秦，秦王以为丞相，有人进谗，秦王乃囚孟尝君，欲杀之。“孟尝君使人求解于秦王幸姬，姬曰：‘愿得君狐白裘。’孟尝君有狐白裘，已献之秦王，无以应姬求。客有善为狗盗者，入秦藏中，盗狐白裘以献姬。姬乃为之言于王而遣之。王后悔，使追之。孟尝君至关，关法，鸡鸣而出客，时尚早，追者将至，客有善为鸡鸣者，野鸡闻之皆鸣。孟尝君乃得脱归。”
    孟尝君门下，食客三千，在这中间，当然有许多高级知识分子，因此，鸡鸣狗盗之徒，在平时是不可能太被重视，也不可能发挥他们的作用的。可是一到紧急关头，当那些峨冠博带的大知识分子束手无策的时候，那些史无名姓而有一技之长的地位较低、学习较少的人，却大大的发挥威力了。
    真正的学问，真正有用处的学问和办法，常常蕴藏在地位不高的平常人的身上，从这个故事，也可以使人破除对学者专家的迷信。
