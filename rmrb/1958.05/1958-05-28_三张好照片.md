    Three Good Photographs
    The newspaper recently published three very good photographs. One is of Eisenhower's worried expression when answering reporters' questions about the American economic situation, with the title "How much more sorrow do you have?" Another is of Nixon being beaten in Venezuela. The third is of Eisenhower in a rage. The photographs were published very timely and made a deep impression. Through these news photographs, people vividly see the predicament of the American ruling clique in the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind. I hope that more of these kinds of photographs can be published in the future to go along with the news. Gan Chi

    三张好照片
    报纸最近登的三张照片很好。一张是艾森豪威尔关于美国经济问题答记者问时的愁态，标题是“问君还有几多愁？”另一张是尼克松在委内瑞拉挨打的照片。第三张是艾森豪威尔发怒的神态。照片刊的很及时，给人的印象很深。通过这些新闻照片，人们形象地看到了美国统治集团在东风压倒西风形势下的窘态。希望以后能配合消息多发表这类照片。　甘池
