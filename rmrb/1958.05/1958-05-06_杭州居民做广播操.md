    Hangzhou Xiaoying Lane residents actively responded to the city's call for 300,000 people to participate in physical exercise and have already organized themselves to persist in doing radio exercises every day. Every day at nine o'clock in the morning, more than forty residents gather to do the second set of radio exercises they have just learned. The residents' director, health committee member, and after-school literacy teachers all take the lead in participating. Almost all of those participating in the exercises are mothers with several children, including elderly men and women in their seventies and eighties. In addition to Xiaoying Lane, residents in Maozhu Lane and Yingmenkou residential areas in Hangzhou are also carrying out radio exercises, with more than 70 people regularly participating. Residents starting to do exercises is a new phenomenon that has emerged after the Hangzhou City Sports Leap Forward Swearing-in Conference.

    杭州居民做广播操
    杭州小营巷的居民积极地响应了全市提出三十万人参加体育锻炼的号召，已经组织起来每天坚持做广播体操。每天上午九点钟，四十多个居民就集合起来做刚学会的第二套广播体操。居民主任，卫生委员，业余扫盲教师全都带头参加，参加做操的几乎大部分是有几个孩子的妈妈，其中还有七八十岁的老太太老爷爷。杭州市目前除了小营巷外，还有毛竹弄和营门口居民区的居民们，也都开展了广播体操活动，经常有七十多人参加做操。居民开始做操，这是杭州市召开了体育跃进誓师大会后出现的新气象。
