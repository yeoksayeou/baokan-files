Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 27th: Speech by Chen Yun, Observer of the People's Republic of China and Vice Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, at the Political Consultative Committee Meeting of the Warsaw Treaty Member States:

    Comrade Chairman, Fellow Representatives:

    The government and people of the People's Republic of China warmly welcome and support the convening of this meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States. The government of the People's Republic of China believes that, in the current new international situation, it is entirely timely and necessary for the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States to convene a meeting to discuss major measures to further ease the tense situation in Europe and the world. The government of the People's Republic of China fully supports all the peace measures proposed at this meeting.

    It has been more than two years since the first meeting of the Political Consultative Committee of the Warsaw Treaty Member States in January 1956. During this period, extremely significant and profound changes have taken place in the international situation. The socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, which already surpassed the imperialist camp headed by the United States in terms of popular support, population size, internal unity, and the speed of production development, has, with the convening of the Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties and the successful launch of two Soviet artificial satellites last year, brought about a new change in the already existing advantage of the forces of peace and socialism over the forces of imperialist war, bringing the world situation to a new turning point. In the international situation, it is no longer the West wind prevailing over the East wind, but the East wind prevailing over the West wind.

    The Moscow meeting of Communist and Workers' Parties and its two declarations in November of last year brought the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the unity of the international communist movement to a new stage. It can be seen that since the Moscow meeting, the friendly unity within the socialist camp has become more consolidated, and the relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation has greatly developed. At the same time, the Soviet Union has achieved brilliant achievements in industrial and agricultural production and science and technology. Ten days ago, the Soviet Union launched the third artificial earth satellite, which is of even greater scientific value, once again proving that the Soviet Union has definitively surpassed the most powerful capitalist country, the United States, in many important areas of science and technology, and will continue to leave the United States far behind. Other socialist countries have also made great progress in the development of their national economies. The Chinese people are currently realizing a great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. All this vividly proves the strength of the socialist camp and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system, thoroughly bankrupting the slander of modern revisionists who denigrate the socialist system and all the slanders against the solidarity and friendly relations between socialist camp countries.

    The socialist camp countries have consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy and have made unremitting efforts to maintain peace. In the recent period, in order to ease international tensions, the Soviet Union and other socialist countries have continuously put forward many major peace initiatives and have taken a series of effective peace measures on their own initiative. All these have been warmly supported by the people of all countries, greatly increasing the prestige of the socialist camp among peace-loving people and countries throughout the world.

    Contrary to the solidarity, vigorous development, and growing international prestige of the socialist camp, the imperialist camp is at the end of its rope, its internal difficulties and contradictions are deepening, and it is in an increasingly isolated and passive position in the international arena. Now, the head of the imperialist camp, the United States, has fallen into a new and deep economic crisis. This crisis is impacting other capitalist countries, promoting the arrival of a global capitalist economic crisis. The economic crisis that occurred on the basis of the greater expansion of the general crisis of capitalism will inevitably exacerbate the various contradictions within the capitalist world and accelerate the process of the decline and demise of imperialism. In fact, the class struggle within imperialist countries has intensified, and some countries are experiencing profound social shocks. The contradictions between imperialist countries, first and foremost between the United States, Britain, and France, have further expanded. The centrifugal tendencies and neutralist sentiments towards the United States continue to develop in many capitalist countries. The imperialist policy of expansion and aggression is heading towards its opposite, and the anti-colonialist movement of the peoples of Asia and Africa to strive for national independence has reached an unprecedented height. The Eisenhower Doctrine quickly met with complete bankruptcy in the eyes of the people of Asia and Africa. U.S. imperialism is currently openly supporting rebels in Indonesia, engaging in subversion, and blatant interference in Lebanon's internal affairs, and will inevitably fail in the end in the face of the resolute opposition of the people of the world. Even Latin America, which is more tightly controlled by the United States and is known as the U.S. "backyard," has launched a massive wave of opposition to U.S. aggression and demands for independence and democracy. The angry reception by the people of Latin American countries of U.S. Vice President Nixon, who went there to carry out aggressive activities, is the best proof.

    The vigorous development of socialist forces and the decline and demise of imperialist forces are the basic characteristics of the current international situation. The development of the situation in the recent period eloquently demonstrates the international situation of the East wind prevailing over the West wind. Life and practice have repeatedly proved that the seemingly powerful U.S. imperialism is nothing more than a "paper tiger" that appears strong on the outside but is weak on the inside, and that all "fear of America" is groundless. Any overestimation of the imperialist war forces and underestimation of the forces of peace and socialism are extremely wrong and harmful. If, in the past, such as after the October Revolution, Lenin, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet people, faced the encirclement of the capitalist world and the armed intervention of fourteen countries without any fear, then how can we be even more afraid of imperialism when the socialist camp is in a position of complete advantage? It should be said that the forces of peace in the world are now stronger than ever before, and it is already possible to prevent imperialist war adventures, and if it dares to provoke a war, the people of the whole world will wipe imperialism off the face of the earth.

    Of course, when we handle specific affairs, we cannot have any contempt for the enemy. In order to oppose war and strive for peace, all peace-loving countries and peoples, first and foremost the socialist camp, must strengthen unity, persist in the struggle, and work hard. In this regard, the Warsaw Treaty has played a significant role. In the past three years, the Warsaw Treaty has made a tremendous contribution to safeguarding the security of the treaty states and maintaining world peace. As everyone knows, the Warsaw Treaty was signed for the purpose of self-defense after the exclusive North Atlantic aggressive bloc had already been formed and this bloc had repeatedly rejected various peace initiatives by the Soviet Union and other European socialist countries regarding the establishment of European collective security. After the signing of the Warsaw Treaty, the Soviet Union and other treaty states still actively advocated the cancellation of existing military blocs in Europe and their replacement with a collective security system, and later proposed the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the member states of the Warsaw Treaty and the North Atlantic group. However, all these have been rejected by Western countries, which continue to adhere to a policy of aggression and war. In this situation, for the sake of the security of the treaty states and the peace of Europe and the world, the Warsaw Treaty must be further strengthened so that all war conspiracies of the imperialist aggressor forces cannot succeed, which is entirely rational and necessary. Modern revisionists equate the Warsaw Treaty with the North Atlantic aggressive bloc, saying that the division of the world into two opposing military-political blocs is the root cause of the current international tension, which is a complete reversal of black and white and an exoneration of the imperialist policy of aggression.

    Comrades! The Chinese people have always believed that world peace is indivisible, and the struggle of the Warsaw Treaty Member States to safeguard European and world peace will always receive the full support of the 600 million Chinese people. The people of all China, as in the past, will continue to unite closely with the socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union and with all peace-loving countries and peoples to fight for lasting world peace. The government of the People's Republic of China is confident that this meeting will have a significant impact on further strengthening the solidarity and cooperation of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and on maintaining European and world peace. I wish the meeting success!

    陈云副总理在华沙条约缔约国政协会议上说
    华沙条约缔约国维护和平的斗争  永远得到六亿中国人民全力支持
    新华社莫斯科27日电　中华人民共和国观察员、中华人民共和国国务院副总理陈云在华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会会议上的发言
    主席同志，各位代表同志：
    中华人民共和国政府和中国人民热烈欢迎并且支持华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会这次会议的召开。中华人民共和国政府认为，在目前新的国际形势下，华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会召开会议，就进一步和缓欧洲和世界紧张局势的重大措施进行讨论，是完全适时的和必要的。中华人民共和国政府完全支持这次会议上所提出的各项和平措施。
    从1956年1月华沙条约缔约国政治协商委员会第一次会议到现在已经两年多了。在这一段时间内，国际形势发生了极其巨大的、深刻的变化。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营，本来就在人心归向、人口众多、内部团结、生产发展速度等方面，超过了以美国为首的帝国主义阵营。在去年，又由于各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议的召开和苏联两颗人造卫星的发射成功，更使早已存在的和平和社会主义力量对帝国主义战争势力的优势，发生了一个新的变化，使世界形势达到了一个新的转折点。在国际形势中，已经不是西风压倒东风，而是东风压倒西风了。
    去年11月各国共产党和工人党莫斯科会议及其所发表的两个宣言，使以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结和国际共产主义运动的团结进入了一个新的阶段。人们可以看到，莫斯科会议后，社会主义阵营内部的友好团结已经更加巩固，相互间的互助合作关系有了巨大的发展。同时，苏联在工农业生产和科学技术方面又取得了辉煌的成就。十天以前，苏联发射的在科学价值上更加巨大的第三个人造地球卫星，再一次证明苏联在许多重要的科学技术方面已经肯定地超过了最强大的资本主义国家美国，并且还将继续把美国远远地抛在后面。其他社会主义国家在国民经济的发展中也都获得了很大的进展。中国人民目前正在实现着工农业生产的大跃进。这一切都生动地证明了社会主义阵营的强大和社会主义制度的无比优越性，使现代修正主义者丑化社会主义制度和对社会主义阵营各国团结友好关系的一切诽谤，遭到彻底的破产。
    社会主义阵营各国一贯奉行着和平的对外政策，并且为维护和平进行着坚持不懈的努力。最近一个时期以来，苏联和其他社会主义国家为了和缓国际紧张局势，不断地提出许多重大的和平倡议，并且主动采取了一系列有效的和平措施。所有这些，都得到了各国人民的热烈拥护，大大增加了社会主义阵营在全世界爱好和平的人民和国家中的威望。
    同社会主义阵营的团结一致、蓬勃发展和国际威望不断增长的情况相反，帝国主义阵营却是日暮途穷，内部的困难和矛盾日益加深，在国际上处于更加孤立和被动的地位。现在，帝国主义阵营的首脑美国，已经陷入新的深刻的经济危机。这个危机正在冲击着其它资本主义国家，促进着资本主义世界性经济危机的到来。在资本主义总危机更加扩大的基础上发生的这次经济危机，必将使资本主义世界内部各种矛盾更趋尖锐化，并且加速着帝国主义的没落和衰亡的过程。事实上，帝国主义国家内的阶级斗争已经加剧，有的国家正在出现着深刻的社会震荡。帝国主义国家间，首先是美、英、法之间的矛盾，更加扩大了。对美国的离心倾向和中立主义情绪在许多资本主义国家中继续发展着。帝国主义的扩张和侵略政策，正在走向它的反面，亚非人民的反殖民主义，争取民族独立的运动已经空前高涨。艾森豪威尔主义很快就在亚非人民的心目中遭到了彻底破产。美帝国主义目前在印度尼西亚公开支持叛乱分子，进行颠覆活动和对黎巴嫩内政的露骨干涉，在全世界人民的坚决反对下，最后必然要失败。连受美国控制较严、素称为美国“后院”的拉丁美洲，也掀起了反对美国侵略、要求独立和民主的巨大浪潮。拉丁美洲各国人民愤怒地接待了前去进行侵略活动的美国副总统尼克松，就是最好的证明。
    社会主义力量的蓬勃发展和帝国主义力量的没落和衰亡，这就是当前国际形势的基本特点。最近一个时期的形势发展，雄辩地说明了国际上东风压倒西风的局势。生活实践也一再证明，貌似强大的美帝国主义不过是一只外强中干的“纸老虎”，一切“恐美病”都是毫无根据的。任何对于帝国主义战争力量估计过高，对于和平和社会主义力量估计不足，都是极端错误的和有害的。如果说在以前，例如在十月革命以后，列宁、苏联共产党和苏联人民，面对着资本主义世界的包围和十四国武装干涉，都毫无所惧，那么，当此社会主义阵营已处于完全优势的情况下，怎么能对帝国主义反而更害怕呢？应当说，现在世界上的和平力量比过去任何时候都更加强大，并且已经有可能制止帝国主义的战争冒险，而且如果它胆敢挑起战争，全世界人民就会把帝国主义从地球上消灭干净。
    当然，我们具体地办起事来，对于敌人却不能有任何轻视。为了反对战争、争取和平，一切爱好和平的国家和人民，首先是社会主义阵营，必须加强团结，坚持斗争，努力工作。在这方面，华沙条约起了重大的作用。过去三年多的时间里，华沙条约对于保障缔约国家安全和维护世界和平有着巨大的贡献。大家知道，华沙条约是在排他性的北大西洋侵略集团早已组成，和这一集团一再拒绝苏联及欧洲其他社会主义国家关于建立欧洲集体安全的各种和平倡议后，为了自卫而签订的。华沙条约签订后，苏联及其他缔约国仍然积极主张取消欧洲现有的军事集团，而代之以集体安全体系，后来又提出在华沙条约和北大西洋集团的成员国之间缔结互不侵犯条约。但是所有这些，都遭到了西方国家的拒绝，它们仍然坚持侵略和战争的政策。在这种情况下，为了缔约国家的安全和欧洲及世界和平，华沙条约就必须进一步加强，以使帝国主义侵略势力的一切战争阴谋难于得逞，这是完全合理的和必要的。现代修正主义者把华沙条约和北大西洋侵略集团相提并论，说什么世界分为两个敌对的军事政治集团是目前国际紧张局势的根本原因等，完全是颠倒黑白和为帝国主义的侵略政策开脱罪责。
    同志们！中国人民一向认为，世界和平是不可分割的，华沙条约缔约国在维护欧洲和世界和平的斗争中，将永远得到六亿中国人民的全力支持。全中国的人民和过去一样，将继续同以苏联为首的社会主义国家，同一切爱好和平的国家和人民紧密地团结在一起，为世界的持久和平而奋斗。中华人民共和国政府确信，这次会议对进一步加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结合作，对维护欧洲和世界和平，都将产生巨大的影响。祝会议成功！
