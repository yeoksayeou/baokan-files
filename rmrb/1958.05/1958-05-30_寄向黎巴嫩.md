    Sent to Lebanon
    Lu Zhao
      Night
    Darkness shrouds the Mediterranean sky
    The sea's gale lashes against the sturdy pines on the shore
    In the pitch-black mountains and fields, myriad lights shimmer
    Like countless stars adorning the dark night sky
    But they are not myriad lights, nor are they stars
    Torches of uprising illuminate the earth, turning it red
    Raging flames will burn away all darkness
    The dawn is about to shine on the peaks of Lebanon
      Morning
    The blue Mediterranean Sea churns with white waves
    The magnificent Lebanese mountains stand tall on the shore
    Verdant Lebanese cedars cover the mountains and fields
    Snow-white Lebanese peaks gleam with silver
                            (Note)
    Bright red flags of justice are planted throughout cities and villages
    Awakened people have formed walls of bronze and iron
    The people's anti-imperialist roar shakes the sea
    Tripoli is the second Port Said
      Salute
    I have flown over Lebanon twice
    The wish to greet my brothers has remained unfulfilled
    Today, please let the east wind carry my best wishes
    Six hundred million people await your songs of victory
    (Note) The Lebanese mountains are located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, and their peaks are covered with snow all year round.

    寄向黎巴嫩
    鲁钊
      黑夜
    黑暗笼罩着地中海的上空
    海上的狂风扑向岸上的劲松
    漆黑的山野闪灼着万家灯火
    好像黝黑的夜空缀上了繁星
    不是万家灯火也不是繁星
    起义的火炬把大地照得通红
    熊熊的火焰将烧尽一切黑暗
    曙光将要照临到黎巴嫩山峰
      早晨
    蓝色的地中海翻滚着白浪
    雄壮的黎巴嫩山?立在岸上
    翠绿的黎巴嫩松覆盖着山野
    雪白的黎巴嫩山峰闪着银光
                            （注）
    鲜红的义旗插遍城市村庄
    觉醒的人民结成了铜壁铁墙
    人民的反帝怒吼震撼着大海
    的黎波里是第二个塞得港
      致敬
    我曾两次飞经黎巴嫩上空
    向兄弟问候的心愿都未完成
    今天请东风把我的祝愿带去
    六亿人民等候着你们胜利的歌声
    （注）黎巴嫩山在地中海东岸，山顶终年积雪。
