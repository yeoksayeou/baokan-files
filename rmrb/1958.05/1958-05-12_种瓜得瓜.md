    You Reap What You Sow

    According to reports from American news agencies, U.S. Vice President Nixon, whose neck was swollen after being beaten in Peru, decided not to visit student and worker leaders after arriving in Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Meanwhile, according to people close to Nixon, in the few Latin American countries Nixon still intends to visit, he will likely abandon the practice of visiting major universities and talking to students.

    It seems that Nixon, who was booed all the way and finally got beaten, has not learned enough lessons from his so-called "goodwill visit" to countries such as Uruguay, Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru. As the saying goes: you reap what you sow, you reap beans from beans. The boos and beatings from the people and students of Latin American countries are obviously not aimed solely at Nixon himself, but at the U.S. government, which is pursuing an imperialist policy in Latin America. Merely avoiding meeting with workers and students will certainly not help.

    种瓜得瓜
    据美国通讯社报道，在秘鲁被打肿了脖子的美国副总统尼克松到达厄瓜多尔首都基多后，决定不再访问学生以及工人领袖。同时，据接近尼克松的人说，尼克松还要访问的几个拉丁美洲国家，他很可能放弃访问主要大学及找学生们谈话的做法。
    看来，一路挨嘘而且终于挨揍的尼克松还没有从他在乌拉圭、阿根廷、玻利维亚和秘鲁等国的所谓“亲善访问”中吸取足够的教训。常言说得好：种瓜得瓜，种豆得豆，拉丁美洲各国人民和学生嘘的和揍的显然并不单是对尼克松本人，而且是对在拉丁美洲执行帝国主义政策的美国政府。仅仅躲避同工人和学生见面，当然无济于事。
