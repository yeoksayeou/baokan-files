In Times of Victory
Tian Fang
    Victory in work can produce two results. One result is being satisfied with the achieved victory, complacency, self-admiration, and self-intoxication, causing work to stagnate. The other result is actively summarizing the experience of victory, improving cadres and the masses, finding ways to continue to advance and further accelerate the pace of progress, and pushing work to a higher stage of development. In the former case, victory is the beginning of failure, and retreat is the continuation of progress, and things will immediately turn in the opposite direction. In the latter case, victory is the beginning of a new victory, and greater victory is the continuation of the achieved victory. People will always stand at the forefront of the times, ride the wind and waves, create new eras, and open up new epochs.
    Chairman Mao's advocated "continuous revolution" refers to the latter situation. All communists and revolutionary comrades should be such "continuous revolution" fighters.
    Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province was known throughout the country last year for its extensive mass participation and outstanding achievements in farmland water conservancy construction. This year, the wheat in this prefecture is growing better than in any previous year, and both total output and yield per mu have doubled compared to last summer harvest, which is a huge victory. However, the comrades in Hubei have not been intoxicated by this victory. They have already brought comrades from various regions here to hold a winter sowing meeting, requiring all regions to learn from the advanced experience of Xiangyang Prefecture in striving for high wheat yields (whether in plains or mountainous areas, high-yield areas or low-yield areas, areas with little land and many people or areas with much land and few people, there are equally typical examples of increased production). They are organizing the vast number of cadres and the masses to make full preparations as early as possible, so-called "grasping this year, seeing next year," and setting out next year's plans as early as possible, requiring that next year be doubled again on the basis of this year's large increase in production. At the same time, they have arranged to strive for a bumper harvest this autumn, and to strive for the annual grain, cotton, and rapeseed to catch up with and exceed the increase in production of similar crops in the past eight years, that is, one year catching up with eight years. In this way, they have pointed out to the people of the entire province, including the people of Xiangyang Prefecture, the path to strive for new and greater victories. In this way, people will seize the opportunity and advance victoriously; and will not "become arrogant upon victory and miss the opportunity," and embark on the road of failure and retreat.
    The development of things is forever endless. China's agricultural production is still at a very low level. The living standards of farmers are generally still very low. Therefore, we need even more to constantly think of what Chairman Mao said about "continuous revolution," that is, continuous progress. And do not become intoxicated with even a slight development.
    Here, there is a need for a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm that forever pursues "the happiness of the people" and the development of social productive forces, and is never satisfied with the status quo. At the same time, there is a need for the Marxist-Leninist dialectical way of thinking. The dialectical method recognizes that the development of things is endless, and that every development only prepares the foundation and conditions for higher development. The opposition and struggle between revolutionary thought and conservative thought is the driving force of development. If people do not want to become laggards and poor wretches in life, they must constantly overcome new conservative thoughts and constantly pursue new developments. And the possibilities for development will never be exhausted.
    We wish Xiangyang Prefecture and Hubei Province's agricultural production will achieve greater development this autumn and next summer, and will forever advance without ceasing.

　　在胜利的时候
　　田方
    工作上的胜利，可以产生两种结果。一种结果，是满足于既得的胜利，沾沾自喜，自我欣赏，自我陶醉，使工作发生停滞。另一种结果，是积极总结胜利的经验，提高干部和群众，找出继续前进和更进一步加快前进速度的道路，把工作推向更高的发展阶段。在前一种情形下，胜利是失败的开始，后退是前进的继续，事情会马上朝着相反的方向转化。在后一种情形下，胜利是新的胜利的开始，更大的胜利是既得胜利的继续。人们将永远站在时代的前头，乘风破浪，创造新的时代，开辟新的纪元。
    毛主席所倡导的“不断革命”，就是指后一种情形说的。所有的共产党人和革命同志，都应当是这样的“不断革命”的战士。
    湖北省襄阳专区去年曾因农田水利建设的广大群众性和卓越成就而闻名全国。今年这个专区的小麦长得比以往任何一年都好，总产量和亩产量都比去年夏收增加一倍，这是一个巨大的胜利。但湖北的同志们并没有为这个胜利而陶醉。他们这样早就把各个地区的同志们找到这里来开冬播会议，要求各地在襄阳专区这个现场上学习争取小麦丰产的先进经验（无论是平地或山区，高产区或低产区，地少人多区或地多人少区，这里都同样有增产的典型。）及早组织广大干部和群众进行充分的准备，所谓“抓住今年，看到明年”，及早定出明年的规划，要求明年能够在今年大增产的基础上再翻一翻。同时布置了争取今年秋季大丰收，争取全年粮食、棉花、油菜能够赶上和超过过去八年同类作物的增产量，即一年赶八年。这样，他们就向全省人民，包括襄阳专区的人民，指出了争取新的更大胜利的道路。这样，人们就会抓紧时机、乘胜前进；而不至于“闻胜而骄，坐失良机”，走上失败和后退的道路。
    事物的发展是永远没有止境的。我国的农业生产，现在还处在很低的水平上。农民的生活水平一般也还很低。所以我们就越发需要经常想到毛主席所说的“不断革命”，即不断前进。而不要稍有发展就陶醉起来。
    这里需要有永远追求“人民幸福”和发展社会生产力的高度革命热情，永远不以现状为满足。同时也需要马克思列宁主义的辩证的思想方法。辩证的方法认定事物的发展永无止境，每一个发展都只是为更高的发展准备了基础和条件。革命思想和保守思想的对立斗争，就是发展的动力。人们如果不愿意成为生活中的落伍者和可怜虫，他们就必须不断地克服新的保守思想，不断地追求新的发展。而发展的可能性是永远也不会用尽的。
    我们预祝襄阳专区和湖北省的农业生产将在今年秋季和明年夏季取得更大的发展，并且永远前进不息。
