    Need to Sew Clothes for Various Body Types
    I am a tall, thin person. There are quite a few people like me who are 1.89 meters tall and thin, but I can't find sweaters and shirts that fit me anywhere on the market. The length and width are always unsuitable. Judging from the specifications produced by knitting factories and shirt sewing cooperatives in various places, they seem to require people's body shapes to be standard: tall must be fat, and short must be thin. However, there is a lack of consideration for who will solve the problem of supplying sweaters and shirts for some tall and thin, and short and fat people. I hope that this rectification can be studied, and that a way can be found to solve the problem of sweaters and shirts worn by tall and thin and short and fat people.

    要缝制各种体材的服装
    我是一个瘦而高的人，像我这样一公尺八九公分高的瘦人还不在少数，可是在市场上到处买不到适合我穿的绒衣和衬衣，长短肥瘦总是不合身，从各地针织厂和衬衫缝纫社生产的规格来看，他们好像要求人们的体形标准必须是：高就得胖，矮就得瘦。但对有些高而瘦，矮而胖的人们的绒衣和衬衣供应问题由谁解决就缺乏考虑了。希望能在这次整改中研究一下，也要设法解决那些瘦而高和矮而胖的人所穿的绒衣和衬衣。　　　　　丈桥
