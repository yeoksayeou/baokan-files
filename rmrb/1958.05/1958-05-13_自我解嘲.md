Notes

　　Self-Deprecating Humor

　　Nixon was booed and insulted everywhere he went in Latin America. However, the American authorities gave Nixon's trip a very high evaluation. It is said that Washington officials believe that Nixon showed "great courage" and that although "stones were thrown like rain," he still persisted in "explaining American policy."

　　"Explaining American policy" actually attracted "stones like rain," so one can imagine what American policy really is in the minds of the Latin American people. In fact, the opposition of the Latin American people to Nixon and their opposition to American policy are one and the same thing. The Washington officials' attempt to portray Nixon as a hero is just a kind of pointless self-deprecating humor.

    自我解嘲
    尼克松在拉丁美洲各国到处挨嘘受骂。可是，美国当局对尼克松此行却给予很高的评价。据说华盛顿人士认为尼克松表现了“很大的勇气”，虽然“投来的石子如雨”，他仍在坚持“解释美国的政策”。
    “解释美国的政策”，竟然招来“石子如雨”，则美国政策在拉丁美洲人民心目中究竟是个什么东西，可想而知。事实上，拉丁美洲各国人民反对尼克松和反对美国的政策，本来就是一回事，华盛顿人士想把尼克松描写为英雄，这不过是一种无聊的自我解嘲而已。
