Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 8th – A spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today, once again clarifying the views of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the issue of peaceful reunification of Vietnam, and refuting point by point the various arguments appearing in the communiqué issued by the South Vietnamese authorities on April 26th.

The spokesman first pointed out that after the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam sent a letter to the South Vietnamese authorities on March 7th proposing early talks between the two sides to discuss mutual disarmament and trade, the South Vietnamese authorities were forced to issue a communiqué on April 26th. This communiqué did not put forward any constructive suggestions to answer the expectations of the people of Vietnam, but only used roundabout methods to cover up U.S. interference in South Vietnam, attempting to confuse domestic and foreign public opinion and evade consultation.

The spokesman reiterated that U.S. interference in South Vietnam is the main obstacle to the cause of peaceful reunification and independence and democracy of the Vietnamese people. The spokesman pointed out that in order to conceal the fact of U.S. interference, the South Vietnamese authorities have racked their brains to slander the relationship between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and various socialist countries. The spokesman solemnly declared: "Our country stands on the side of the socialist camp precisely to defend peace and national independence." He said that in the struggle to maintain peace and realize the reunification of Vietnam, the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries have always sympathized with and supported us. Precisely because of this, the people of Vietnam, from south to north, have clearly seen that standing on the side of the socialist camp is in their own interests.

The statement said that the Southern authorities used "the North has no democracy" as an excuse to refuse to consult with the North, but in fact, it is the South that has no democracy. Addressing the South Vietnamese authorities' slander of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in their communiqué, the statement said that the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is elected by the people. It represents the nation's unyielding will, the will of the Vietnamese people for independence, unity, and democracy, and is the true representative of the Vietnamese nation. In contrast, the so-called "referendum" and unilateral election of the National Assembly held by the South Vietnamese authorities in the past were to realize the U.S. conspiracy to split Vietnam. This approach violates the wishes of the entire nation.

The spokesman exposed the South Vietnamese authorities' purpose in demanding the abolition of state-run trade in the North, which was, on the one hand, to evade discussing trade issues between the two sides with the North, and on the other hand, to attempt to allow some unscrupulous merchants to engage in speculation and manipulation, controlling the market and monopolizing the Northern economy.

He said that under the chaotic and anti-people economic and political system in South Vietnam, the people are increasingly suffering, which causes pain and indignation to all patriots. These are all consequences of U.S. interference in the South.

When talking about the South Vietnamese authorities' request that the North abandon the so-called promotion of revolutionary movements in the South, the spokesman said that it is well known that revolution is carried out consciously and voluntarily by the people; no one can force or promote anyone, and at the same time, no force can stop it.

The statement, when discussing the issue of peace and national reunification in Vietnam, reiterated the consistent position of the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, namely: "To unify the country through peaceful means on the basis of independence and democracy, in accordance with the provisions of the Geneva Accords."

The spokesman pointed out that all Vietnamese patriots believe that it is difficult to resolve issues related to the interests of the people of the North and South without holding consultations between the two sides, and that it is impossible to unify the country through peaceful means. Since February 1955, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has put forward many beneficial suggestions for restoring normal relations between the North and South, such as mutual trade, free movement of people between the two sides, and postal communication. The spokesman said: The people of Vietnam demand that the Southern authorities must seek concrete measures to solve these issues related to the interests of the entire nation, and not always refuse and ignore them.

The statement said that the different views on many issues between the two sides should not prevent them from sitting down for consultation and discussion.

The statement reiterated the proposal put forward by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in its letter to the Southern authorities on March 7th to discuss mutual trade and disarmament through consultation. The statement also believed that through consultation between the two sides, it would be possible to jointly discuss the issues of free movement and free postal communication between the two sides, which the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has repeatedly raised and which were also mentioned in the communiqué of the Southern regime. The statement pointed out that the Vietnamese people will continue to support any individual or faction that makes all efforts to create favorable conditions for consultation and talks between the North and South, and for the peaceful reunification of the country.

    越南政府重申要和平统一祖国
    认为南越当局公报未提出任何建设性意见
    美国对南越的干涉是和平统一的主要障碍
    新华社河内8日电　越南民主共和国总理府发言人今天发表声明，再一次阐明了越南民主共和国政府对和平统一越南问题的一些看法，并且对南越当局在4月26日发表的公报中出现的各色论调，逐一加以驳斥。
    发言人首先指出，在越南民主共和国政府3月7日写信给南越当局提出双方早日会谈以协商共同裁军和互通贸易的创议后，南越当局被迫在4月26日发表了一个公报，这个公报没有提出任何一点建设性的意见来回答越南全国人民的期待，而只是采用一些拐弯抹角的办法，来替美国干涉南越打掩护，企图迷惑国内外视听和回避协商。
    发言人重申，美国对南越的干涉是越南人民和平统一和独立民主事业的主要障碍。发言人指出，为了掩饰美国干涉的事实，南越当局挖空心思来诬蔑越南民主共和国同各社会主义国家之间的关系。发言人郑重宣称：“我国之所以站在社会主义阵营方面，正是为了保卫和平和民族独立。”他说，在维护和平和实现越南统一的斗争中，苏联、中国和其他社会主义国家一向同情和支持我们，正因为这样，越南从南到北的人民已经清楚地看到，站在社会主义阵营方面是符合自己的利益的。
    声明说，南方当局以“北方没有民主”作为借口来拒绝同北方协商，可是实际上正是南方没有民主。针对南越当局的公报对越南民主共和国国会的诬蔑，声明说，越南民主共和国国会是人民选举产生的，它代表着民族不屈不挠的意志，代表着越南人民的独立、统一和民主的意志，是越南民族的真正代表。相反，南越当局过去举行的所谓“公民投票”和片面的选举国会是为了实现美国分裂越南的阴谋。这种做法违背了全国人民的愿望。
    发言人揭露南越当局要求取消北方的国营贸易的目的，一方面是为了回避同北方商谈双方贸易问题，同时是企图使一些奸商投机倒把，操纵市场，垄断北方经济。
    他说，在南越混乱的、反人民的经济、政治制度之下，人民越来越痛苦，使所有爱国者一想起就痛心疾首。这些都是美国干涉南方的后果。
    在谈到南越当局要求北方放弃所谓促进南方革命运动的问题时，发言人说，尽人皆知，革命是人们自觉自愿地进行的，谁也不能强迫或促使谁，同时，也没有任何力量能阻挡它。
    声明在谈到关于越南的和平和国家统一的问题时重申了越南民主共和国政府一贯的主张，即：“根据日内瓦协议的规定，在独立和民主的基础上通过和平方法统一国家。”
    发言人指出，所有越南的爱国者都认为双方不举行协商就难于解决有关北、南两方人民利益的问题，并且无法通过和平方法来统一国家。越南民主共和国从1955年2月以来曾经为恢复北南两地的正常关系而提出许多有益的建议。如：互通贸易、两方人民可以自由来往、两方通邮等问题。发言人说：越南全国人民要求南方当局必须寻求确实的施措解决这些有关全国人民利益的问题，而不能老是推却和置之不理。
    声明说，双方在许多问题上的不同观点并不能妨碍双方坐下来协商和讨论。
    声明重申了越南民主共和国3月7日在给南方当局的信中所提出的关于通过协商来讨论互通贸易和裁军问题的建议。声明并且认为通过双方的协商才可以共同讨论越南民主共和国政府曾经多次提出的、而且在南方政权的公报中也曾经提到的关于双方自由来往和自由通邮的问题。声明指出，越南人民将不断支持任何个人或派别为北南双方的协商和会谈，为国家的和平统一创造顺利条件而作出的一切努力。
