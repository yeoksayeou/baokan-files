A Suggestion
    Newspapers are tools for conducting socialist education among the people. However, it is not easy for workers, farmers, and even some cooperatives and single-teacher primary schools to subscribe to a newspaper. I think: organs, organizations, and schools subscribe to more newspapers; after reading, except for saving one or two copies, they are generally sold as waste paper or even wasted. I think it would be perfectly acceptable to donate them to cooperatives and single-teacher primary schools to read, or to post them on nearby walls for residents to see. This could greatly enhance the role of newspapers.

    一个建议
    报纸是向人民进行社会主义教育的工具。可是工人农民，甚至有些合作社和单级小学，要订份报纸看看，也并不简单。我想到：机关、团体、学校，订的报纸比较多；阅后，除保存一两份外，一般都作废纸卖掉，甚或糟蹋掉。我以为满可赠给合作社、单级小学去看，或张贴在附近墙上，给居民看。这就可以大大发挥报纸的作用。
