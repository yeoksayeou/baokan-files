Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 8th: Wuhan City has recently converted a batch of buildings originally used as offices, schools, barracks, and dormitories into factory buildings for the expansion and construction of local industries.

The area of these buildings totals over 22,000 square meters. Utilizing these buildings for expanding and constructing factory buildings can save the state over 2 million yuan in investment, and especially enable existing factories to immediately expand production, and allow new factories to be completed and put into production earlier. After the jointly owned public-private Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory obtained a batch of buildings, its production expanded three times compared to the original, and it can increase its output value by 13 million yuan this year.

Based on Wuhan's housing situation, the potential in this area is significant. Some units' canteens and warehouses were originally factory buildings; some used warehouses or factory buildings as offices and dormitories; and after some units streamlined their organizations and cadres were transferred to lower levels this year, many buildings became idle. In recent years, the construction, expansion, and takeover of warehouses in the Wuhan area have also been insufficiently rational in operation and management, with multiple and dispersed management, and the utilization rate is not high due to certain limitations in material storage, resulting in serious waste. With some adjustments, small factories can be quickly set up.

    利用机关学校的房屋办工厂
    新华社武汉8日电　武汉市最近利用一批原来是机关、学校、营房和宿舍的房屋，改成了地方工业扩建新建工厂的厂房。
    这批房屋的面积共有二万二千多平方公尺。利用这些房屋扩建新建厂房，可给国家节约投资二百多万元，特别是可以使现有工厂立即扩大生产；使新工厂可以早日建成投入生产。公私合营久安制药厂得到一批房屋后，生产比原来扩大了三倍，今年可增加产值一千三百万元。
    根据武汉市的住房情况看，这方面的潜力是很大的。有些单位的食堂、仓库原来就是工厂厂房；有的用仓库或厂房做了办公室和宿舍；今年有些单位精简机构、干部下放后，很多房屋闲起来了。几年来，武汉地区兴建、扩建、接管的仓库，在经营管理上也不够合理，多头分散，加以物资贮存有一定的局限性，使用率不高，浪费现象严重。加以调整，就可以很快的办起小工厂来。
