Notes:

    The Mystery of the "Two-Party System"
    United Press International, in commenting on the recent so-called "elections" in South Korea, wrote: "Despite small-scale (?) violence and illegal acts, democracy and the two-party system are basically still functioning in Korea (meaning South Korea)."
    On one hand, there are "violent incidents and illegal acts," and on the other hand, there is "democracy" that "is still functioning." This is already a bizarre theory that is difficult for a normal mind to understand. But there is also a "two-party system" at work. What is going on? It turns out that South Korea has two parties. One is Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party," and the other is the "opposition party," called the "Democratic Party." It is well known that Syngman Rhee's "Liberal Party" is a tool of the American ruling group. So what kind of party is the "Democratic Party"? United Press International said: The "Democratic Party's"主張 (zhǔzhāng) which translates to "advocacy" or "proposition" is "similar to Secretary of State Dulles's line…." So that’s how it is! The so-called "two-party system" at work is nothing more than two American parties at work; the so-called "democracy" is nothing more than "democracy" between Dulles and Dulles!

### “两党制”的奥妙

    “两党制”的奥妙
    美国国际新闻社在评论最近南朝鲜的所谓“选举”时写道：“尽管发生过小规模的（？）暴力事件和非法行为，民主和两党制在朝鲜（指南朝鲜）基本上还在起作用。”
    一边有“暴力事件和非法行为”，一边却又有“民主”，而且“还起作用”，这已经是正常的头脑所难以理解的怪论了。可是，还有“两党制”也在起作用，这又是怎么回事呢？原来南朝鲜有两个党，一个就是李承晚的“自由党”，还有一个是“反对党”，叫“民主党”。李承晚的“自由党”是美国统治集团的工具，这是人所共知的。那么“民主党”是怎样一个党呢？国际新闻社说：“民主党”的主张“同美国国务卿杜勒斯的路线相似……。”原来如此！所谓“两党制”在起作用，不过是两个美国党在起作用；所谓“民主”，不过是杜勒斯和杜勒斯之间的“民主”！
