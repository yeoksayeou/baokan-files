The National Symposium on Rice Pest and Disease Control, held at the end of April in Xiaogan County, Hubei Province, comprehensively studied the prevention and control of rice pests and diseases.

The meeting believed that in order to ensure the continuous leap forward in rice production, it is essential to actively expand the area for preventing and controlling rice pests and diseases. According to the targets proposed by the twelve provinces (regions) present at the meeting, the area for rice pest and disease prevention and control in 1958 will be expanded to more than 270 million mu, accounting for half of the country's rice area, which is double the national prevention area in 1957. Among them, a large-scale thorough control will be carried out on more than 113 million mu, an increase of 37 times compared with 1957, and 156 counties free from rice pests and diseases should be established. If this year's target is completed, with a minimum guaranteed increase of 30 jin per mu, it can increase the nation's rice production by 8.1 billion jin.

In terms of technical measures for preventing and controlling rice pests and diseases, it was unanimously agreed that the past practice of controlling one pest and one disease should be changed. It is required to take crops as the target, adopt comprehensive measures combining agricultural technology and chemical control, take rice stem borer control as the key, while simultaneously controlling other pests, seize the key periods, and achieve "one key can open several locks." In terms of diseases, due to the frequent seed transfers and the greatly increased fertilizer application this year, special attention should be paid to the prevention and control of rice blast.

Although the supply of pesticides and machinery to rice-producing areas this year has increased significantly compared with previous years, it is still far from the quantity needed by various regions. Therefore, it is required that all regions should conduct comprehensive planning in the use of pesticides and machinery, save on pesticide use, and advocate for clever fighting. It is necessary to strengthen forecasting and early warning work, focusing on the prevention and control of rice paddies most susceptible to pests and diseases. The meeting believed that the effective local pesticides and methods used in various regions for preventing and controlling rice pests and diseases can also be promoted.

The meeting believed that strengthening leadership, with the Party Secretary taking the lead, and establishing command posts at all levels to carry out large-scale thorough control is a good method. At the same time, on this basis, organizing joint prevention between societies, counties, special zones, and even provinces is also very important. This is a new development in pest and disease prevention and control under the situation of the Great Leap Forward and is worth promoting. With joint prevention, a dragnet is cast over pests and diseases, not allowing them any opportunity to exploit loopholes and continue to cause harm. According to the statistics of seven provinces alone, this year there are 31 joint prevention efforts between counties and special zones in the prevention and control of rice pests and diseases, with a joint prevention area of more than 39 million mu. At this symposium, Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, through consultation, organized joint operations between Jiaxing Special Zone and Suzhou Special Zone, which are adjacent to the two provinces.

During the meeting, the representatives visited Changfeng Agricultural Cooperative and Wusi Agricultural Cooperative in Xiaogan County, and learned from Xiaogan's experience in preventing and controlling rice pests and diseases. The main experience of Xiaogan County is the combination of leadership, the masses, and technology. First, command posts for pest and disease prevention and control were established from the county to the township to the society, with the Party Committee Secretary taking the lead and technical personnel participating, to study and deploy together. Second, the role of technical personnel was fully utilized, relying on experts to impart technology. Third, the masses were fully mobilized to hand over the prevention and control tasks to the masses, overcome conservative ideas, and launch a mass insect control movement. Fourth, insect control was included in the production plan, achieving "six fixed" to households (fixed fields, fixed quality, fixed person, fixed work points, fixed pesticides and machinery, fixed rewards). And it is necessary to do a good job in the supply of pesticides and machinery. Therefore, the rate of rice stem borer damage in the county has been reduced from 15%-20% before liberation to 2.2%. The representatives were greatly inspired and believed that it would be of great help to future work.

    以治螟为纲兼治其他害虫
    全国防治水稻病虫害座谈会确定扩大防治面积
    本报讯　4月底在湖北孝感县召开了全国防治水稻病虫害座谈会，全面研究了水稻病虫害的防治工作。
    会议认为，保证水稻生产不断的跃进，积极扩大防治水稻病虫害的面积，是非常必要的。根据到会十二个省（区）提出的指标，1958年水稻病虫害的防治面积，将扩大到二亿七千多万亩，为全国水稻面积的一半，比1957年全国防治面积增加了一倍。其中大面积彻底防治一亿一千三百多万亩，比1957年增长三十七倍，并要搞好一百五十六个无水稻病虫害县。完成今年这个指标，以每亩最少保证增产三十斤计算，可为国家增产稻谷八十一亿斤。
    在防治水稻病虫技术措施方面，一致认为应当改变以往防治一虫一病的做法，要求以作物为对象，采取农业技术与药剂防治相结合的综合措施，以治螟虫为纲，兼治其他害虫，抓住关键时期，做到“一把钥匙能开几把锁”。在病害方面，由于今年各地调种频繁，施肥量大大增加，要特别注意防治稻瘟病。
    今年供应稻区的药械虽比往年增加很多，但和各地需要的数量比起来，还相差很远。因此，要求各地在药械使用上，应进行全面规划，节省用药，提倡打巧仗。要加强预测预报工作，着重防治最易遭受病虫为害的稻田。会议认为，各地防治水稻病虫行之有效的土药土法也可推广。
    会议认为，加强领导，书记挂帅，逐级成立指挥部，搞大面积彻底防治，是个好办法。同时在这一基础上，组织社与社、县与县、专区与专区、甚至省与省的联防也是很重要的。这是在大跃进的形势下，防治病虫害的一种新发展，值得提倡。有了联防，便给病虫撒下天罗地网，不让病虫钻空子和继续为害的机会。仅根据七个省的统计，今年在防治水稻病虫上县与县、专区与专区的联防已有三十一个，联防面积三千九百多万亩。在这次座谈会上，江苏、浙江两省通过协商，在两省相邻的嘉兴专区与苏州专区组织联合作战。
    会议期间，代表们在孝感县参观了长风农业社和五四农业社，学习了孝感防治水稻病虫害的经验。孝感县的主要经验是领导、群众、技术三结合。首先由县到乡、到社都成立了防治病虫害指挥部，党委书记挂帅，技术人员参加，一块研究，一块布置。其次是充分发挥技术人员的作用，依靠专家传授技术。第三是充分发动群众，把防治任务交给群众，克服保守思想，开展群众性的治虫运动。第四是把治虫列入生产规划，作到“六定”到户（定田、定质量、定专人、定工分、定药械、定奖励）。并要作好药械供应工作。因此全县的水稻螟虫为害率已由解放前的15％—20％压缩到2.2％。代表们得到很大启发，认为对今后工作帮助很大。
