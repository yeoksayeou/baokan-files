　　Shenyang's Pioneer in Reforming Enterprise Management: Songling Machinery Factory

　　This newspaper Shenyang, 14th. The CCP Shenyang Municipal Committee convened an on-site meeting at the Shenyang Songling Machinery Factory on April 23 to promote the experience of workers in the seventh work section of the twenty-first workshop participating in enterprise management. The Shenyang Municipal Committee believes that the experience of this work section proves that as long as the masses are trusted and relied upon, and the sense of responsibility of the working masses as masters is brought into play, allowing them to consciously and voluntarily assume some management responsibilities in daily production activities, so that everyone participates and supervises each other, they will assist administrative management cadres in doing a better job of production management. It also greatly simplifies the administrative management personnel who are detached from production. This points out the direction for how enterprise management should follow the mass line.
　　The leaders of the twenty-first workshop of Shenyang Songling Machinery Factory, based on the workers' suggestions on April 1, delegated the management work of product quality, tool management, supplies consumption, civilized production, and attendance system to the work section, handing it over to the workers. The workers of the work section formed a product quality group, electing Qian Jinfang, a seventh-grade worker, as the group leader, with the inspector, two veteran workers, and the work section director as members, to promptly study quality problems, find the causes, and prevent them; strictly implement the "three-check system," requiring the first two pieces of work to undergo three inspections before production can continue. When the foreman assigns work, they carefully inform the workers of potential problems and points to note. After receiving the work, the workers meticulously understand all the drawings and process documents before starting, emphasizing prevention. For all tasks, workers elect dedicated personnel to be responsible and develop simple and strict work systems. Since April 1, when workers began taking over these six management tasks and directly participating in enterprise management, all aspects of work have taken on a new look. Product quality has unprecedentedly eliminated defective products, and reworked products have decreased by 85% compared to the same period in February. Because the tool management group promptly publishes tool consumption indicators and prices, workers use tools carefully and sparingly. The tool expense in January was seventy-four yuan, but in the first twenty days of April, it was only five yuan and six jiao. In terms of civilized production, it has become the best work section in the entire workshop and has also motivated the first and third work sections. (Wang Dianxue)

　　沈阳改革企业管理工作的先锋——松陵机械厂
　　本报沈阳14日电　4月23日，中共沈阳市委在沈阳松陵机械厂召开现场会议，推广这个厂二十一车间七工段工人参加企业管理的经验。沈阳市委认为这个工段的经验证明，只要信任群众，依靠群众，发挥职工群众的主人翁责任感，让他们在日常生产活动中，自觉自愿地承担一些管理责任，做到大家动手，互相监督，就会协助行政管理干部把生产管理工作搞得更好，还可以大大精简脱离生产的行政管理人员。这给企业管理工作如何走群众路线指出了方向。
      沈阳松陵机械厂二十一车间领导是在4月1日根据工人的建议，将产品质量、工具管理、用品消耗、文明生产、考勤制度等六方面的管理工作，下放到工段交给工人的。工段工人成立了产品质量小组，推选七级工钱进发为组长，检验员、两名老工人、工段主任为组员，对发生的质量问题，进行及时研究、找出原因和防止办法；严格执行“三检制”，做的头两个活，都要经过三次检查，合格后才能继续生产。工长分配活时，先将可能发生的问题和注意的地方仔细告诉工人，工人接到活后，细致地将图纸和工艺文件全部弄懂后再做，做到以防止为主。各项工作，工人都推选专人负责，都制定有简便、严密的工作制度。4月1日工人开始接管这六项管理工作，直接参加企业管理以来，各项工作都面貌一新。产品质量破天荒消灭了废品，反修品比2月份同时期减少85％。由于工具管理小组及时公布工具消耗指标和价格，工人都精打细算地使用工具。1月份工具费用开支是七十四元，4月份头二十天只用五元六角。在文明生产方面，已经成为全车间最好的工段，并把一、三工段带动起来。（王殿学）
