Xinhua News Agency, 22nd. Vast wheat fields with tall stalks, large ears, and plump grains are ripening in the Huanghuai Plain. Provinces such as Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong are fully mobilizing and organizing for the summer harvest. The tense final battle to win a major summer harvest this year is about to begin in full swing.

A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture told Xinhua News Agency reporters: If there are no major disasters in the next month or so, this year's summer harvest will be an unprecedentedly large and comprehensive one. Doing a good job in this year's summer harvest and the subsequent summer planting work is the central task that the wheat-producing areas need to devote all their efforts to at present. Not only must we ensure that we fight the final battle for a major summer harvest this year, but we must also make the necessary strategic preparations during the wheat harvest for autumn sowing this year (planting wheat after autumn) and for striving for an even greater summer harvest next year.

The spokesperson said: This year, the national summer harvest area reaches over 538 million mu, which is larger than last year, but more importantly, the yield per unit area has greatly increased compared to last year. Winter wheat accounts for more than 300 million mu of the 500 million mu, in addition to rapeseed, peas, broad beans, potatoes, and sweet potatoes. Provinces such as Guangdong and Fujian, and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have already completed the harvest of wheat and other crops. Sichuan, Guizhou, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang and other provinces have also basically completed or are in the process of harvesting wheat, rapeseed, peas and broad beans. These areas have all had bumper harvests this year. The rapeseed harvest is the first bumper harvest since liberation. Hubei, Hunan and Jiangxi, which used to have low rapeseed yields, have changed the face of low rapeseed yields this year, and there have been high-yield records of more than 700 jin per mu. Wheat yields have generally increased by several times compared to last year. This year's peas and broad beans are also bountiful, with Zhejiang Province seeing high-yield records of more than 1,000 jin for both peas and broad beans.

Now, the main wheat-producing areas in China, the provinces in the Huai River basin and the Yellow River basin, are about to harvest wheat, and some areas have already started harvesting. This year, wheat generally grows better than in previous years, not only in high-yield wheat fields, but also in ordinary wheat fields. Among them, Henan, Hubei, and the Huai River area of Anhui are the best. In the vast wheat fields, the wheat ears are level with the chest, with many large ears and plump grains, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. Widespread harvesting can be done by the end of May and the beginning of June, entering a busy period. Although some areas of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces have experienced spring drought, the wheat is also growing better than in previous years. Areas north of the Yellow River can be harvested around early to mid-June. Provinces south of the Yellow River are now making general mobilization for the wheat harvest. More than 80% of the labor force in Henan Province's troops, government cadres, and school teachers and students are preparing to join the wheat harvest battle to support farmers in rushing to harvest.

The spokesperson pointed out: Such an extraordinary summer harvest is the result of the new upsurge in agricultural production since last winter and this spring. In the past six months, large-scale water conservancy projects have been built, a large amount of fertilizer has been accumulated, and meticulous management with more water and fertilizer has been adopted for wheat fields. Spring drought was overcome in Hebei, and the recent wind-induced lodging was overcome in Henan. Various places have also overcome many pests and diseases, so that such a summer harvest has been achieved. We ask all localities to fight the last battle of the wheat harvest and ensure that the harvested grain is brought in.

Harvesting wheat is the most intense battle, and it must be done by harvesting wherever it is ripe, and in a timely manner. We must be thousands of times more vigilant to prevent disasters such as wind, hail, and rainstorms that may occur in the moment before harvest. Areas that cannot be harvested yet should continue to prevent lodging and continue to fight against pests and diseases. During the wheat harvest, meteorological stations in various places should forecast weather changes at any time; the rural areas should immediately strengthen the listening network, organize a commando force for emergency harvesting, and be adequately prepared for emergency harvesting in very bad weather.

This year's summer harvest must be meticulous and thorough, and every grain must be returned home. Whether it is cutting wheat, transporting it, or threshing it, it is required to lose as few wheat ears and wheat grains as possible. Returning every grain home should become the slogan of action for everyone participating in the wheat harvest, and inspections should be organized and children should be organized to pick up wheat ears.

A major summer harvest will lay the foundation for a full-year harvest. We must learn from the lessons of 1956, when heavy rains caused a bumper harvest not to translate into a good yield, and make careful calculations and arrangements for tools and labor. Due to the bumper harvest, the labor force required for wheat harvesting this year is much larger than in previous years, and it is also the most intense time for summer planting, summer hoeing, and cotton field management. All full and semi-labor forces of agricultural cooperatives must be mobilized, and tools must be improved to improve labor efficiency. People in cities in various places should also learn from the methods of Henan and other places and go to the countryside to provide support as much as possible. In addition, the rational arrangement of wheat harvesting work is also important. On-the-spot harvesting and threshing, organizing scattered threshing, and emergency rapid methods such as harvesting wheat ears first can be adopted.

The spokesperson also emphasized that preparations should be made now for an even greater summer harvest next year. This autumn, the quality and quantity of wheat seeds and whether they can be planted early will depend on whether preparations are made during the summer harvest. During this year's summer harvest, efforts should be organized to select seeds, select enough high-quality wheat seeds that can ensure dense planting this autumn, and high-quality wheat seeds that are resistant to water and fertilizer, high-yielding, lodging-resistant, and resistant to pests and diseases. Existing good varieties in various places should be carefully collected. According to the requirements of rational close planting, more than 20 jin of seeds per mu must be reserved, which must be explained clearly to the masses, and good storage work must be done. At the same time, in summer planting, attention should be paid to arranging land for wheat planting this autumn to ensure that wheat is planted early and in a timely manner this year.

Finally, the spokesperson said that the summer harvest is a crucial battle related to the great leap forward in agricultural production, and political work must keep up. Propaganda and education work must be done well before the summer harvest, and agitation work during the summer harvest is very important. The defense work to protect the bumper harvest is even more important, mobilizing the masses to defend the summer harvest, strengthening the militia's patrol of fields and threshing grounds, strengthening the control of controlled elements, and paying attention to preventing all possible sabotage.

    五亿亩夏熟作物黄金遍地  全面动员确保全面丰收
    并为明年夏季更大的丰收作好战略准备
    新华社22日讯　黄淮平原长得秆高穗大、籽粒饱满的大片麦田已次第黄熟，河南、湖北、安徽、江苏、山东等省正全面动员和组织夏收，广大农村都在赶制夏收农具和安排夏收的劳力。争取今年夏季大丰收的紧张的最后一战即将全面展开。
    农业部发言人对新华社记者说：今年的夏收如今后一个月左右时间内无特大灾害将是一个空前未有的大丰收，而且是全面丰收。搞好今年的夏收和紧接着的夏种工作，是麦产区当前需要全力以赴的中心。不仅要保证打好今年夏季大丰收的最后一战，而且要在收麦中为今年秋播（秋后种麦），为争取明年夏季更大的丰收作好必要的战略准备。
    发言人说：今年全国夏收面积达五万三千八百多万亩，比去年扩大，而更主要的是单位面积产量比去年大大提高了。五亿多亩中冬小麦占三亿多亩，此外为油菜、豌豆、蚕豆、马铃薯、甘薯等作物。广东、福建等省和广西僮族自治区的小麦等作物早已收获完毕，四川、贵州、湖南、江西、浙江等省的小麦、油菜、豌蚕豆也已经基本收完或者正在收打。这些地区今年都丰收了。油菜是解放以来第一次丰收，一向油菜低产的湖北、湖南和江西今年改变了油菜低产的面貌，并出现了亩产七百多斤的高额丰产纪录。小麦一般都比去年增产了几成。今年豌、蚕豆也是丰收的，浙江省豌豆和蚕豆都出现了千斤以上的丰产纪录。
    现在我国主要产麦区淮河流域和黄河流域各省，已快收麦，部分地区已经开镰。今年小麦普遍比往年长得好，不仅是丰产麦田长得好，一般麦田也比往年好。其中河南、湖北和安徽淮北地区最好。广大的麦田麦穗齐胸，穗多穗大，籽粒饱满，一片丰收景象。5月底6月初就可普遍收割，进入大忙。河北、山东、山西、陕西等省部分地区虽有春旱，但小麦也长得比往年好。黄河以北地区6月上中旬即可普遍收割。黄河以南各省现在都在作麦收的总动员，河南省的驻军、机关干部和学校师生80％以上的劳力都准备投入麦收战斗，支援农民抢收。
    发言人指出：这样一次不平凡的夏收是去冬今春以来农业生产新高潮的结果。半年多来大修水利、大积肥，对麦田采用了多水多肥的精细管理，在河北战胜了春旱，在河南战胜了不久前的大风倒伏，各地还克服了许多病虫害，才取得这样的夏收，我们要求各地打好收麦最后一战，保证把丰收粮食拿到手。
    收麦是最紧张的战斗，一定要作到那里黄熟那里收割，及时收割，千百倍地提高警惕，防止收割前瞬间可能发生的风雹暴雨等灾害。还不能收割的地区应继续防止倒伏和继续向病虫害作斗争。麦收期间各地气象台站要随时预报天气变化；农村中应即加强收听网，组织好抢收的突击力量，作到对非常天气下突击抢收有足够准备。
    今年夏收一定要作到精收细打，颗粒还家。无论割麦、运输、打场，都要求尽可能地不损失麦穗，不损失麦粒。颗粒还家应成为一切参加收麦的人的行动口号，并且要组织检查和组织小孩拾麦穗。
    夏季大丰收将为全年的丰收打下基础，一定要接受1956年因暴雨造成丰产不丰收的教训，对工具和劳力作细致的计算和安排。由于丰收，今年收麦需要的劳力比往年多得多，同时又是夏种夏锄、棉田管理最紧张的时候。一定要把农业社一切全半劳力动员上去，同时改进工具来提高劳动的效率。各地城市人民也应学习河南等地的办法，尽可能地下乡支援。此外，收麦工作的合理安排也是重要的。就地收割就地碾场脱粒，组织分散打场以及先收麦穗等等应急快速办法是可以采用的。
    发言人还强调现在就要为明年夏季更大的丰收作准备。今年秋天种麦，种子的质量和数量以及能不能早种，决定于夏收中是否做好准备。今年夏收中要组织力量选种，选够保证今秋密植的足够的优良麦种，能够耐水耐肥、产量高、抗倒伏、抗病虫的优良麦种。各地已有的良种要注意收起来。按照合理密植的要求，每亩须留二十多斤种子，要通过鸣放在群众中解释清楚，并要做好保管工作。同时，夏种中要注意安排今秋种麦的土地，保证今年种麦种得早，种得及时。
    最后，发言人说，夏收是关系到农业生产大跃进的严重的一战，政治工作要跟上。要做好夏收前的宣传教育工作，夏收中的鼓动工作很重要，保卫大丰收的保卫工作更重要，发动群众保卫夏收，加强民兵的巡地巡场工作，加强对管制分子的管制，注意防止一切可能的破坏。（附图片）
