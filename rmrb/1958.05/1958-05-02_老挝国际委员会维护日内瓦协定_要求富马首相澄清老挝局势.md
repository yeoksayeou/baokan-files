Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 1st: According to the Vietnam News Agency on May 1st, the Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, Ansari, wrote to the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Laos, Phouma, on April 18th, expressing his hope that the government of the Kingdom of Laos would take appropriate measures to clarify the situation in Laos.

The letter stated that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos had noted Prince Souphanouvong's letter to Prime Minister Phouma on April 9th, which mentioned some incidents occurring in various parts of Laos that would undermine the spirit of reconciliation and coordination that led the government of the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units to reach an agreement last November. The letter expressed its belief that Prime Minister Phouma would recognize the importance of promptly replying to Prince Souphanouvong's letter in order to prevent the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords on the Laotian question from being undermined and to prevent the upcoming supplementary elections from being jeopardized.

    老挝国际委员会维护日内瓦协定
    要求富马首相澄清老挝局势
    新华社河内1日电　据越南通讯社1日讯：老挝国际委员会主席安萨里曾经在4月18日写信给老挝王国首相富马，表示希望老挝王国政府采取适当措施，以澄清老挝的局势。
    信上说，老挝国际委员会已经注意到苏发努冯亲王在4月9日写给富马首相的信，这封信提到老挝国内各地发生了一些事件，这些事件势将削弱那种促使老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队在去年11月达成协议的和解、协调的精神。信上表示相信，富马首相能够认识到迅速答复苏发努冯亲王的信件的重要性，这是为了使日内瓦会议关于老挝问题的协定的彻底执行不致受到损害以及使即将到来的补充选举不致遭到危害。
