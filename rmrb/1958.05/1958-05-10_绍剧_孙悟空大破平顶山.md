Shaoxing Opera's "monkey plays" have a unique traditional style. "Sun Wukong Defeats the Flat Top Mountain" is one of the best. The whole play does not simply rely on martial arts to win, but is characterized by a high degree of comedy and profound character depiction. The Sun Wukong created by Liu Ling Tong has received high praise.

    绍剧“孙悟空大破平顶山”
    绍剧的“猴戏”有着独特的传统风格。“孙悟空大破平顶山”，就是其中的一出好戏。全剧并不单靠武打取胜，而是以高度的喜剧性和深刻的性格刻划为特色的。六龄童创造的孙悟空，得到很高的评价。
