　　Menglianggu Campaign
    Starting in March 1947, under the heavy blows of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang army was forced to abandon its all-out offensive and instead adopted a strategy of focused offensives. In the east, they concentrated 450,000 troops to invade Shandong, and in the west, they concentrated 230,000 troops to invade northern Shaanxi. On May 11, the Kuomintang army assembled fifteen reorganized divisions, nearly 300,000 troops, and launched a three-pronged attack northwards from the Linyi-Tai'an line, attempting to annihilate our main force in the Yimeng Mountains or force our army to retreat to the narrow area of Jiaodong. At that moment, our army swiftly surrounded the enemy's main attacking force, the 74th Reorganized Division, in the Menglianggu area southeast of Mengyin. From May 13th to 16th, after four days of fierce fighting, the Kuomintang's top-tier elite troops, fully equipped with American weapons, and known as the "Imperial Guard," the 74th Reorganized Division, with more than 32,000 soldiers, were completely, thoroughly, and cleanly annihilated. The division commander, Zhang Lingfu, was killed in action. While we were encircling and annihilating the 74th Division, Chiang Kai-shek personally ordered other Kuomintang armies to reinforce desperately, but they were all blocked by our army and could not advance. After the 74th Division was annihilated, the Kuomintang army invading the Yimeng Mountains collapsed across the board. The Battle of Menglianggu was a crushing blow to the Kuomintang army's focused offensive in Shandong. At the time, authoritative military commentators in East China commented that this battle "marked the beginning of a shift in the East China war situation. The enemy will be forced to stop its adventurous offensive and will be forced into a passive position. The People's Liberation Army will from now on begin to seize the initiative in the war, and will use perseverance to gradually eliminate the enemy in front of us along a difficult road, striving for the arrival of a comprehensive counter-offensive."

　　孟良崮战役
    从1947年3月起，国民党军队在人民解放军的重重打击之下，被迫放弃全面进攻，改取重点进攻。东面集中四十五万兵力进犯山东，西面集中二十三万兵力进犯陕北。5月11日，国民党军队集结十五个整编师近三十万人由临沂泰安一线，分三路北犯，企图把我军的主力消灭在沂蒙山区，或者压迫我军退至胶东狭窄地区。就在这时，我军以迅雷之势将敌人进攻的主力整编七十四师包围于蒙阴东南的孟良崮地区。从5月13日到16日经过四天激战，将国民党的头等精锐部队、全部美械装备、号称“御林军”的整编七十四师三万二千多人全部、彻底、干净地加以歼灭。该师师长张灵甫被击毙。当我围歼七十四师的时候，蒋介石曾亲自勒令其他各路蒋军拼死增援，但均被我军阻击不得前进。七十四师被歼后，进犯沂蒙山区的国民党军即全线溃退。孟良崮战役对国民党军在山东的重点进攻是一个粉碎性的打击，当时华东权威军事评论家评论这一战役说：“孟良崮战斗的胜利，标志着华东战局的开始转变，敌人将被迫停止其冒险进攻，敌人将转而处于被动，人民解放军将从此开始夺得战争主动权，将以坚忍的毅力，循艰巨的道路，逐次歼灭当面的敌人，争取全面反攻的到来。”
