Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 16th. Hebei Province has put forward the slogan "Seeking Iron from Deep Mountains" and decided to build 237 small blast furnaces before July 1st. By the end of the year, it plans to complete 936 small and some medium-sized blast furnaces, and produce more than 360,000 tons of pig iron by the end of the year to meet the needs of the rapid development of local industry.

This plan was formulated at the recent emergency pig iron promotion meeting held by the Hebei Provincial Party Committee with representatives from various special districts and cities. The meeting pointed out that water conservancy construction and agricultural technology transformation require a large amount of machinery and new agricultural tools, and industrial capital construction itself requires a large amount of building materials and equipment. The new large and medium-sized steel plants in the province will not be put into production within two years, and they themselves will also need a large amount of steel to support them. This new situation has created a tense "gap" in the province's pig iron supply. Therefore, the meeting requested the entire Party and all the people to take the spirit of vigorously developing the water conservancy movement and vigorously develop "Funing-style" small blast furnaces, which are quick to build, require little investment, and yield quick results. Vigorously developing small blast furnaces should be regarded as the central task of local industry. In all areas with iron ore resources, we must do our best to develop small blast furnaces and make a great leap forward in the pig iron industry.

In order to ensure the completion of this year's plan for building small blast furnaces, the representatives discussed the issue of collaboration. Tianjin City has undertaken the task of supplying different types of blowers needed for the construction of small blast furnaces throughout the province. Shijiazhuang City is willing to provide 1,000 tons of iron, and Zhangjiakou City will provide 500 tons of iron to support Tianjin City in manufacturing blowers. The refractory bricks for the construction of small blast furnaces throughout the province are all contracted by Tangshan City and Handan City. Shijiazhuang Special District proposed to organize investment from the plains to the mountains or joint ventures between the mountains and the plains to expand sources of funds and build more small blast furnaces. Cangxian County and Tianjin Special District also decided to consult with Chengde, Zhangjiakou and other places after the meeting to sign contracts for collaborating on small blast furnaces.

### 向深山要铁  河北今年建设九百多座中小型高炉

　　向深山要铁
    河北今年建设九百多座中小型高炉
    新华社天津16日电　河北省提出了“向深山索铁”的行动口号，决定在“七一”以前建起二百三十七座小型炼铁炉，年底建成九百三十六座小型和部分中型炼铁炉，并且要在年底生产出三十六万多吨生铁，供应地方工业迅速发展的需要。
    这个计划是在中共河北省委最近召开的各专区、市紧急生铁促进会议上制订的。这次会议指出：水利建设和农业技术改造需要大量的机械和新式农具，工业基本建设本身需要大量的建筑材料和设备，省内新建的大中型钢铁厂二年以内还不能投入生产，而它本身也还需要大量的钢铁去支援。这个新的情况，给全省的生铁供应造成了紧张的“青黄不接”的局面。因此，会议要求全党全民拿出大搞水利运动的劲头，大力发展建得快、投资少、收效大的“抚宁式”小型炼铁炉，要把大力发展小高炉当作当前地方工业中的中心任务，在一切蕴藏铁矿资源的地区，尽最大努力发展小高炉，使生铁工业来一个大跃进。
    为了保证完成今年建设小高炉的计划，到会代表讨论了协作问题。天津市包下了全省建设小高炉需要的不同型号的鼓风机，石家庄市愿意拿出一千吨铁，张家口市拿出五百吨铁来支援天津市制造鼓风机。全省建设小高炉的耐火砖，全部由唐山市和邯郸市包了下来。石家庄专区提出组织平原到山区投资或者山区平原合营等方式扩大资金来源，多建小高炉。沧县和天津专区也决定会后和承德、张家口等地商订协作搞小高炉的合同。
