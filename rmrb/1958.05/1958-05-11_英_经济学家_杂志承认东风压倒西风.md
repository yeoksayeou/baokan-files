Xinhua News Agency, London, 10th: The British bourgeois magazine "The Economist" has expressed serious concern over the faster development of productivity in socialist countries compared to Western countries.

The magazine, in an editorial titled "Appeal to America" in its May 3rd issue, stated that for "many thoughtful people" in Western European countries, "the most prominent political fact today is not the hydrogen bomb, ... but rather the recent fact that the productivity of the Communist world is growing faster than that of the 'free world.'" The editorial said that this unfavorable situation for the latter is likely to worsen this year.

The magazine pointed out that in many socialist countries, the output in 1958 "is likely to increase by another 10%", while in many Western countries, "the best they can hope for is to maintain the status quo."

The magazine appealed to the United States, which is struggling with an economic crisis, to find ways to prevent the American economic crisis from affecting other Western countries.

　　英“经济学家”杂志承认东风压倒西风
    新华社10日讯  伦敦消息：英国资产阶级刊物“经济学家”杂志对于社会主义阵营国家的生产力比西方国家发展得快表示严重不安。
    这家杂志5月3日一期在题为“向美国呼吁”的社论中说，对于西欧国家的“许多有思想的人”来说，“今天最突出的政治事实不是氢弹，……而是最近共产党世界的生产力比‘自由世界’的生产力增长得更快。”社论说，而且这种不利于后者的形势今年大概会有更坏的发展。
    杂志指出，在许多社会主义国家中，1958年的产量“很可能还会增加10％”，而在许多西方国家中，“最好也不过维持原状。”
    这家杂志向正被经济危机弄得焦头烂额的美国呼吁寻找办法来避免美国经济危机影响到其他西方国家。
