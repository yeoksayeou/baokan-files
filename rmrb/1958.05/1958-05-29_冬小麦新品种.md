New Winter Wheat Varieties

"Huabei 479" is a new variety cultivated by the former North China Agricultural Science Research Institute. Its characteristics are: strong tillering ability, tolerance to fertilizer and water, strong stalks that are not easily lodged or shattered, resistance to stripe rust, and large, white grains. In 1956, trials in Beijing showed it yielded 15% more than "Zaoyangmai," with small-area yields exceeding 500 jin. "Huabei 479" matures three to four days later than general varieties in Beijing.

"Nongda 183" is a new wheat variety selected and bred by Beijing Agricultural University in 1955. Three years of trials have proven that small-area yields per mu exceed 500 jin. Its characteristics are: short stalks, early maturity, fertilizer tolerance, and high resistance to stripe rust.

"No. 54" wheat was bred by the Shaanxi Comprehensive Agricultural Experiment Station in 1952 using asexual hybridization. The unit yield of "No. 54" in Wugong, Shaanxi, is 10% higher than "Bima No. 1" and 8.4% higher than "6028." This variety has the following characteristics: strong stalks, fertilizer tolerance, high yield, white grains, and strong resistance to loose smut.

"51 Wheat" was bred by the Sichuan Agricultural Science Research Institute in 1954. According to two years of trial planting, its yield per mu is higher than "Ailiduo" and "Nanda 2419," generally 10%-15% higher than "Nanda 2419." "51 Wheat" has weak stalks in the seedling stage but becomes strong later, with particularly strong lodging resistance. This variety is fertilizer-tolerant and suitable for planting in relatively fertile soil. Resistance to loose smut and stripe rust are also its advantages. "51 Wheat" has a stronger spring habit and is suitable for late sowing.

"134" and "612" are two new wheat varieties selected and bred by the Northwest Agricultural Science Research Institute. Their common characteristics are: short plants, thick stalks that are not easily lodged, maturity three to four days later than "Bima No. 1," resistance to wheat midges and wheat stem blackening, and suitability for cultivation in irrigated land in the Northwest region. The 1956 trial results in Wugong showed that "134" yielded 12.5% more than "6028" and 14.7% more than "Bima No. 1"; "612" yielded 16.2% more than "2028" and 18.4% more than "Bima No. 1."

    冬小麦新品种
    “华北479”是前华北农业科学研究所育成的一个新品种。它的特点是：分药力很强，耐肥耐水，基秆坚韧不易倒伏、落粒，能抗条锈病，粒大面白。1956年在北京试验，它比“早洋麦”增产15％，小面积产量在五百斤以上。“华北479”成熟期比北京的一般品种迟熟三、四天。
    “农大183”是北京农业大学1955年选育的小麦新品种。经过三年的试验证明，小面积亩产量在五百斤以上。秆较矮、早熟、耐肥、高度抗条锈病，是它的特点。
    “54号”小麦是陕西综合农业试验站1952年用无性杂交方法育成的。“54号”的单位产量，在陕西武功高出“碧蚂一号”10％，比“6028”增产8.4％。这个品种有以下几个特点：秆硬、耐肥、产量高、粒白、对黑穗病的抵抗力也强。
    “51小麦”是四川农业科学研究所1954年育成的。据两年的试种，它的每亩产量比“矮粒多”“南大2419”还高，一般的比“南大2419”增产10％—15％。“51小麦”苗期秆弱，后期转坚实，抗倒伏力特别强。这个品种耐肥，适宜种在比较肥沃的土壤上。抗黑穗病、条锈病也是它的优点。“51小麦”春性较强，适于迟播。
    “134”和“612”是西北农业科学研究所新选育的两个小麦品种。它们的共同特点是：株矮，秆粗不易倒伏，成熟期比“碧蚂一号”晚三、四天，抗吸浆虫和秆黑粉病，适宜在西北地区水浇地栽培。1956年在武功试验结果：“134”比“6028”增产12.5％，比“碧蚂一号”增产14.7％；“612”比“2028”增产16.2％，比“碧蚂一号”增产18.4％。
