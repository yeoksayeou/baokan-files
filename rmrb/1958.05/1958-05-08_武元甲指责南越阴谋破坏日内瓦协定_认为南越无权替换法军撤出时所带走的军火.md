Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 7th - According to a Vietnam News Agency report: General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnamese People's Army, said today while receiving a Vietnam News Agency reporter: "The South Vietnamese authorities have no right to replace the weapons and war materials taken away by the French Expeditionary Forces when they withdrew from South Vietnam."

Vo Nguyen Giap's words were in response to the following news: It is said that the South Vietnamese authorities are going to raise the issue of the Geneva Accords permitting them to replace the weapons and war materials taken away by the French Expeditionary Forces when they withdrew from South Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that the General Headquarters of the Vietnamese People's Army has not yet received formal notification on this issue. But if the South Vietnamese authorities raise this replacement issue, it is very clear that this is a new conspiracy aimed at seriously sabotaging the Geneva Accords. Vo Nguyen Giap said that the withdrawal of the French Expeditionary Forces from South Vietnam constitutes a definitive withdrawal from Vietnamese territory, and that introducing any other troops and war materials as replacements should not be allowed under any circumstances. He said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that this is a fundamental issue concerning the principles of the Geneva Accords aimed at preventing the resumption of hostilities in Vietnam. This principle clearly needs to be upheld. The South Vietnamese authorities must not replace the weapons taken away from Vietnam by the French troops.

He pointed out that the purpose of this attempt by the South Vietnamese authorities is to distort the Geneva Accords, implement the American policy of military reinforcement and war preparations in South Vietnam, and illegally transport weapons and war materials into South Vietnam.

Vo Nguyen Giap said that he did not yet know the attitude of the International Commission on this issue. But he believes that, given the responsibility the International Commission bears for ensuring the implementation of the Geneva Accords, if this issue is raised in the commission, it will consider and resolve the issue satisfactorily in accordance with the spirit and letter of the Geneva Accords.

    武元甲指责南越阴谋破坏日内瓦协定
    认为南越无权替换法军撤出时所带走的军火
    据新华社河内7日电　据越南通讯社报道：越南人民军总司令武元甲将军今天在接见越南通讯社记者的时候说：“南越当局没有权利替换法国远征军在撤出南越的时候所带走的武器和作战物资。”
    武元甲的话是针对下述消息说的：据说，南越当局将要提出日内瓦协定准许它替换法国远征军在撤出南越的时候所带走的武器和作战物资的问题。
    武元甲说，越南人民军总司令部在这个问题上还没有得到正式通知。但是如果南越当局提出这种替换问题的话，那很明显，这是一个目的在于严重破坏日内瓦协定的新阴谋。武元甲说，法国远征军撤出南越就是肯定地撤出了越南领土，把运入任何其他军队和作战物资作为替换都是决不能允许的。他说，越南民主共和国政府认为，这是关乎以防止越南敌对行动恢复为目的的日内瓦协定的原则的根本问题。这项原则显然需要维护。南越当局不得替换法国军队从越南带走的武器。　　
    他指出，南越当局的这种企图的目的是要歪曲日内瓦协定，执行美国在南越进行军事增援和准备战争的政策，把武器和作战物资非法运入南越。
    武元甲说，他还不知道国际委员会在这个问题上的态度。但是他认为，鉴于国际委员会在保证日内瓦协定的履行方面所负的责任，如果这个问题在委员会中提出，它会按照日内瓦协定的精神和文字令人满意地考虑和解决这个问题。
