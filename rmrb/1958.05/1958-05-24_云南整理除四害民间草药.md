Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 23rd: Forty-nine kinds of folk plant medicines and ancient prescriptions for eliminating the four pests have been excavated and organized by the health departments of Yunnan Province.

    The indoor and field trials of twenty-five kinds of medicinal plants, such as mountain begonia, conducted in Kunming have been completed, and the effective ingredients, standard usages, and appropriate dosages of various medicines have been proposed. More than twenty other types are being prepared for testing.

    The pyrethrum from Eryuan County, after being dried and ground, can kill mosquitoes, flies, and bedbugs. Its pyrethrin content is about 1.5%, which is better than the pyrethrum from Shandong and the Yangtze River coast, and also stronger than the imported Japanese pyrethrum. *Chong Tianzi* is a specialty of Yunnan and is also a good medicine for killing maggots and eliminating mosquitoes. Three centimeters of *Chong Tianzi* can eliminate mosquito larvae densely growing in one square meter of water, and three kilograms of *Chong Tianzi* can replace one kilogram of "666" powder. These effective plant medicines have now been successively introduced and promoted in Yunnan's medical journals and Yunnan Daily.
