    Let Factories Spread Throughout the Capital
    Over Sixty Units Vacate Housing
    (Our newspaper reporter Ren Zhiqiao reports) In order to promote the development of industry in the capital, many central and Beijing municipal units are handing over surplus housing to establish factories.
    This is an important new measure in the urban construction of the capital.
    The relevant leaders of most central and Beijing municipal units attach great importance to this measure, and the leading comrades of many units personally supervise the vacation of housing in their units. To date, more than sixty units inside and outside the city have handed over 260,000 square meters of housing, of which 160,000 square meters have been handed over to the Beijing Municipal Planning Commission or distributed to factories. The directly affiliated organs of the CPC Central Committee handed over 40,000 square meters of surplus housing in one go. The First and Second Commercial Ministries have handed over several buildings and many bungalows with a total area of more than 40,000 square meters. The First Ministry of Machine Building has initially handed over more than 8,000 square meters of housing, and the ministry is also preparing to further tap the potential of housing and vacate another 100,000 to 150,000 square meters of vacant housing. The administrative organs of the Beijing Municipal People's Committee and other municipal organs have handed over more than 50,000 square meters of vacant housing and are further adjusting to strive to hand over more housing. Many units have submitted housing handover plans to the Beijing Municipal Real Estate Administration Bureau, which is in charge of housing, and they are preparing to adjust and hand over the surplus housing of their units in stages and batches.
    The housing allocated to the industrial sector has achieved preliminary results. After the Advanced Party School of the CPC Central Committee handed over 16,000 square meters of vacant housing to the Beijing Radio Equipment Factory, the workers were overjoyed, moved overnight, and expanded production a year ahead of schedule. The production workshops and offices of this factory were originally scattered in more than a dozen places, which limited the further development of production capacity. After moving to the new site, the annual plan for producing radios and crystal radios will leap from 7,000 to 170,000. This factory not only shortened the construction time but also saved the state 800,000 yuan in housing construction investment. After the milk workshop of Yili Food Company moved into more than 40 rooms handed over by the former Second Ministry of Machine Building, it can produce an additional 2 million yuan worth of condensed milk and milk powder for the country every year. After the Xinhua Rubber Factory used the new factory buildings, it added new varieties such as men's short boots and light boots, which can increase production by 200,000 to 300,000 pairs this year to meet consumer needs.
    Beijing vacating housing to support industry is an important achievement of the rectification movement. Since liberation, Beijing has built many houses, but due to the increasing size of the organs and the gradual increase in personnel, housing has always been very tight. After the rectification movement, especially the streamlining of institutions, the transfer of cadres, and the Two Antis campaign began, the situation changed. Many units broke with departmentalism and took the initiative to hand over surplus housing. This change fully shows that the overall concept and thrifty style of leading cadres and staff members of various organs have formed a new fashion. At present, the work of handing over surplus housing has been launched throughout Beijing. The relevant departments in Beijing plan to transfer 800,000 to 1 million square meters of housing this year to support industrial construction, education, and the adjustment of organ housing.

### 让工厂遍布首都  六十多个单位腾出房屋

    让工厂遍布首都
    六十多个单位腾出房屋
    本报讯　记者任志樵报道：为了促进首都工业的发展，中央和北京市的许多单位，正在把多余的房屋交出来兴办工厂。
    这是首都城市建设中的一个重要的新措施。
    中央和北京市级多数单位有关领导人对这项措施都十分重视，许多单位的领导同志亲自督促本单位腾房。到目前为止，城内外已经有六十多个单位交出了二十六万平方公尺的房屋，其中的十六万平方公尺已交给了北京市计划委员会或分给了工厂。中共中央直属机关一次就交出多余房屋四万平方公尺。第一、第二两个商业部已经把有四万多平方公尺面积的几座楼房和许多平房交了出来。第一机械工业部初步交出了八千多平方公尺的房屋，这个部还准备进一步挖掘房屋的潜力，再腾出十万到十五万平方公尺的空房。北京市人民委员会的各行政机关和其他市级机关已经交出空房五万多平方公尺，并且正在进一步调整，争取交出更多的房屋。许多单位向主管房屋的北京市房地产管理局报送了交房计划，他们准备分期、分批地调整和交出本单位的多余房屋。
    分配给工业部门的房屋已经收到了初步效果。中共中央高级党校把一万六千平方公尺的空房交给北京市广播器材厂以后，职工们喜出望外，星夜搬家，提前一年扩大了生产。这个工厂的生产车间和办公室原来分散在十几个地方，限制了生产能力的进一步发挥，迁进新址以后，年产收音机和矿石收音机的计划将由七千架跃进到十七万架。这个厂不仅因此缩短了建厂时间，而且节省了国家八十万元的建房投资。义利食品公司牛奶车间搬进了原第二机械工业部交出的四十多间房屋后，每年可以为国家多生产价值二百万元的炼乳和奶粉。新华橡胶厂利用新厂房后，增加了男短靴和轻便靴等新品种，今年可以增产二十万到三十万双，以满足消费者的需要。
    北京腾出房屋支援工业是整风运动的一个重要收获。解放以来，北京建筑了很多房屋，但是由于各机关的机构日益庞大，人员逐渐增多，用房始终感到十分紧张。整风运动特别是紧缩机构、下放干部和双反运动开始以后，情况就不同了，许多单位都破除本位主义，主动地把多余房屋交出来。这个变化充分说明，各机关领导干部和工作人员的整体观念、俭朴作风已经形成为一种新的风尚。目前，交出多余房屋的工作已经在北京全市范围内展开。北京市有关部门计划今年内抽调八十万到一百万平方公尺的房屋支援工业建设、教育事业和调整机关用房。
