Xinhua News Agency, May 30th: A vigorous campaign to publicize the general line for socialist construction has begun in the capital today. More than 5,000 municipal-level reporters composed of leading Party cadres from various units, and tens of thousands of reporters organized by the districts and units themselves, have begun to give reports throughout the city. All urban and rural residents of the city will hear reports on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in the coming days.

    From early morning to late evening today, many units such as government organs, schools, factories, shops, hospitals, handicraft cooperatives, construction sites, and rural areas in the suburbs of the city had Party reporters or leading Party and government officials from the respective units giving reports on the general line to Party members and the masses. After listening to the report from Zhou Guanwu, representative to the "Eighth National Congress" and director of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the workers expressed their determination to implement the general line with practical actions. Jiang Nanxiang, alternate member of the CPC Central Committee and president of Tsinghua University, called on all teachers and students to plant red flags and uproot white flags in his report, planting red flags in everyone's minds and all over Tsinghua University.

    Zhou Ren, representative to the "Eighth National Congress" and secretary of the Dongcheng District Party Committee; Wang Jingming, representative to the "Eighth National Congress" and secretary of the Fengtai District Party Committee; and Shan Zhaoxiang, secretary of the Chaoyang District Party Committee, all gave reports to shop workers, rural cadres, transferred cadres, and farmers in their respective districts today.

    In the evening, propaganda teams appeared on the streets. Actors from more than a dozen theatrical troupes, including the Beijing Pingju Opera Troupe, immediately beat gongs and drums, held up banners and picture boards, and went to Tiananmen Square and other bustling areas to publicize the general line to the people after hearing the reports. The propaganda brigade, composed of more than 300 employees of the Beijing Fine Arts Company, carried out propaganda to pedestrians with red lanterns at night. Tonight, many cinemas screened slides promoting the general line. Now, all literary and art workers in the city have taken active action and are writing and rehearsing literary and art programs to publicize the general line overnight. The campaign to publicize the general line in the city will reach a climax in the next day or two.

    Prior to this, many government organs, factories, and schools in Beijing had invited representatives to the "Eighth National Congress" to give reports to them. After listening to the report by Song Ting, representative to the "Eighth National Congress" and secretary of the Party Committee of the Beijing United Cotton Textile Factory, the workers immediately took active action. The workers of the Third Branch proposed to improve technology and increase the number of machines tended without increasing personnel, and to start three shifts in production soon. After listening to the report by Wang Qiufang, secretary of the Party Committee of the Jingxi Coal Mine, who attended the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" as a nonvoting delegate, the workers were even more enthusiastic, and the coal production on the 29th reached 12,378 tons, creating the highest daily output record in the mine's history.

    让总路线深入人心
    首都开始宣传运动
    据新华社30日讯　一个大张旗鼓宣传建设社会主义总路线的运动，今天已在首都展开。由各单位党员负责干部组成的五千多名市级报告员和各区、各单位自己组织的成千上万名报告员，已开始在全市各地作报告。全市所有城乡居民都将在今后几天内听到有关中共八大二次会议的传达报告。
    今天从早到晚，许多机关、学校、工厂、商店、医院、手工业合作社、建筑工地等单位和市郊农村，都有党的报告员或各单位的党政负责人在向党员和群众作关于总路线的传达报告。石景山钢铁厂的职工听了“八大”代表、工厂厂长周冠五的传达报告后，纷纷表示要以实际行动贯彻总路线。中共中央后补委员、清华大学校长蒋南翔在报告中，号召全校师生都来插红旗拔白旗，把红旗插在每个人的思想上，把红旗插遍清华园。
    “八大”代表、东城区区委书记周仁，“八大”代表、丰台区区委书记王景铭和朝阳区区委书记单昭祥，今天都分别向所在区的商店职工、农村干部、下放干部和农民作了传达报告。
    在傍晚的时候，街头上出现了文艺宣传队。北京市评剧团等十多个剧团的演员们，在刚听了传达报告以后，就立即敲着锣鼓，举着标语、图画牌，到天安门广场和其他闹市向人们宣传总路线。北京市美术公司的三百多职工组成的宣传大队，夜晚打着红灯向行人进行宣传。今天晚间，很多电影院放映了宣传总路线的幻灯片。现在全市的文艺工作者都已积极行动起来，正在连夜编写和排练宣传总路线的文艺节目。全市宣传总路线的运动在今后一、两天内将达到高潮。
    在这以前，北京市的很多机关、工厂、学校已经邀请“八大”代表向他们作了报告。北京联合棉纺织厂的职工听了“八大”代表、工厂党委书记宋汀的报告后，立即积极行动起来，三分厂的职工提出在不增一人的条件下提高技术，增加看机台数，在最近开三班生产。京西煤矿的工人们在听了列席“八大”二次会议的工厂党委书记王秋芳的报告后，干劲更加十足，29日产煤量达一万二千三百七十八吨，创造了这个矿有史以来日产量的最高纪录。
