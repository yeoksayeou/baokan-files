Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 25th: Kishi Nobusuke, president of the Liberal Democratic Party, stated at a press conference on the 24th that the basic policies of his new cabinet will remain: externally submitting to the United States and antagonizing the Chinese people, and internally strengthening the suppression of democratic movements.

At the first press conference held after the general election, Kishi Nobusuke assured that he would continue to cooperate with the "free world." He said that Japan cannot allow its relationship with the "free world" to become "lukewarm."

When a reporter asked how Kishi Nobusuke intended to handle the Sino-Japanese trade issue, Kishi Nobusuke's response indicated that he would adhere to the policy of undermining Sino-Japanese trade and antagonizing the Chinese people. He said that he did not believe there was anything wrong with his approach, and therefore, there was no need to rush into any action. He also arrogantly stated that he intended to demand "self-reflection" from China with a "stern attitude" and intended to work to eliminate so-called "misunderstandings."

Kishi Nobusuke's adoption of this arrogant attitude stems from his belief that he can do whatever he wants after fraudulently obtaining a majority of seats in the general election, and that he no longer needs to be concerned about the opposition of the Japanese people. He boasted that "the majority of the people expressed their support for us through elections." However, the facts show that this election was held under the control of Kishi Nobusuke, relying on the state apparatus to conduct multi-faceted control, and the true public opinion was not fully reflected. Japanese monopoly groups provided huge funds to help the Liberal Democratic Party campaign, and the Kishi Nobusuke group continuously attacked and persecuted progressive forces such as the Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and trade unions. Despite this, Kishi Nobusuke was unable to completely stifle public opinion. Although the Liberal Democratic Party only decreased by 1% of the seats in this general election, that is, decreased by three seats, even according to the statistics of the Japanese government's Autonomous Agency, the Liberal Democratic Party's vote rate in this election decreased by 5.4% compared with the general election in February 1955, that is, decreased by 410,000 votes. The Socialist Party and the Communist Party’s votes increased by more than 2.5 million votes combined.

Despite Kishi Nobusuke's extreme efforts to undermine Sino-Japanese relations during the election to please the United States, he will still not be able to escape the problem of resolving this issue after the election, let alone escape the responsibility for undermining Sino-Japanese relations. Kyodo News believes that the issue of China "has become a major issue that the new cabinet must deal with first." After the general election results were announced, people from all walks of life in Japan issued statements one after another, unanimously demanding that the Japanese government take measures to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese business community hopes that the new government will formulate a clear foreign policy, resolve Sino-Japanese trade issues, and lift U.S. import restrictions on Japan.

A 25-year-old Japanese female office worker, in a recorded interview with the "Mainichi Shimbun," pointed out that if the Kishi Nobusuke government thinks that its policy towards China has won the support of the masses in the general election, it is completely wrong. She said that Japanese youth demand a change in the foreign policy of leaning to one side, the United States. Her call reflects the demands of people from broad strata of Japanese society.

Kishi Nobusuke's attempt to shift the responsibility for undermining Sino-Japanese relations onto China is a futile effort.

The Japanese people demand that Kishi Nobusuke reflect on his erroneous policy of pleasing the United States and antagonizing China. Kishi Nobusuke knows that he cannot completely circumvent the issue of Sino-Japanese relations, so he repeated his old tune at the press conference on the 24th, saying, "Although we do not recognize Communist China, we will provide all conveniences to promote trade. This policy will not change." Kishi Nobusuke's trick of undermining Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese trade under the guise of "promoting trade" has long been exposed. He is now repeating his old tune, still trying to create some illusions among the Japanese people and continue to deceive them, which is futile.

At the press conference, Kishi Nobusuke also stated that he would continue to implement the policy of turning Japan into a U.S. nuclear weapons base. He openly opposed issuing a declaration prohibiting Japan from implementing nuclear armament, and insisted that issuing such a declaration was "inappropriate."

At the same time, Kishi Nobusuke smeared the movements within Japan striving for independence, peace, and democracy, and stated that he would wage a "resolute struggle" against various people's movements.

The Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party have preliminarily agreed on the 24th to convene a special session of the newly elected House of Representatives on June 10 to complete the legal procedures for Kishi Nobusuke's re-organization of the cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party's plan to monopolize various leadership positions in the Diet, so as to freely promote various reactionary policies. The Kishi Nobusuke group, which was hit hard in the general election, is wooing various pro-American and reactionary factions and figures. Kishi Nobusuke reiterated on the 24th that he would bring the extremely pro-American Hayato Ikeda into his new cabinet. According to Jiji Press, Kishi Nobusuke intends to have the discredited former Prime Minister Hitoshi Ashida serve as Speaker of the House of Representatives. At the same time, the Liberal Democratic Party is actively lobbying conservative independent members of the House of Representatives to join the Liberal Democratic Party. The Kishi Nobusuke group has also repeatedly claimed that the Liberal Democratic Party will monopolize the positions of Speaker of the House of Representatives and leaders of various standing committees. Kishi Nobusuke's organization of a new government that leans even more towards the United States cannot stabilize a reactionary regime that violates the will of the Japanese people. On the contrary, Kishi Nobusuke's new cabinet will encounter even stronger opposition from the Japanese people. Kishi Nobusuke cannot eliminate the internal disputes within the Japanese ruling group either. Kyodo News believes that the factional struggle within the Liberal Democratic Party, which has become more intense in the general election, "will not be eliminated so simply."

Leaders of the Japanese Communist Party have called on the Japanese people to continue to launch struggles and defeat the various conspiracies of the upcoming Kishi Nobusuke cabinet. The Socialist Party stated on the 24th that it opposed the Liberal Democratic Party's monopoly of various leadership positions in the House of Representatives. The Socialist Party demanded that, according to past practices, a Socialist Party member should serve as Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives, and that the Socialist Party should retain a corresponding number of chairmanships of the standing committees of the House of Representatives according to the proportion of seats.

### 对外屈从美国敌视中国　对内加强镇压民主运动  岸信介表示要坚持反动政策

    对外屈从美国敌视中国　对内加强镇压民主运动
    岸信介表示要坚持反动政策
    新华社25日讯　东京消息：自由民主党总裁岸信介24日在记者招待会上表示，他的新内阁的基本政策将仍然是：对外屈从美国，敌视中国人民，对内加强镇压民主运动。
    岸信介在大选以后第一次举行的记者招待会上保证，他将继续同“自由世界”合作。他说，日本不能容许自己同“自由世界”的关系“冷淡”下去。
    有记者问岸信介打算怎样处理中日贸易问题，岸信介的答复表明，他要坚持破坏中日贸易和敌视中国人民的政策。他说，他不认为他的方针有错误，因此，没有必要急急忙忙地采取什么行动。他并且狂妄地说，他打算以“严正的态度”要求中国进行“反省”，打算努力消除所谓“误会”。
    岸信介采取这种嚣张态度，是他自以为在大选中骗取了多数议席以后，自以为可以为所欲为，对日本人民的反对不再有所顾忌。他侈谈什么“多数国民通过选举表示支持我们”。但是，事实说明，这次大选是在岸信介依靠他所掌握的国家机器多方进行控制的情况下举行，真正的民意并没有能够得到充分的反映。日本垄断集团拿出了巨大的资金帮助自由民主党竞选，岸信介集团并且对日本共产党、社会党和工会等进步力量不断加以打击和迫害。尽管如此，岸信介还是没有能够完全扼杀民意。自由民主党在这次大选中虽然议席只减少了1％，即减少了三席，但是，即使根据日本政府自治厅的统计，自由民主党在这次大选中的得票率比1955年2月的大选减少了5.4％，即减少了四十一万票。而社会党和共产党的选票合共增加了二百五十多万张。
    尽管岸信介为了讨好美国在大选期间极力破坏中日关系，但是，在大选以后他仍然不可能逃避解决这个问题，更不可能逃避破坏中日关系的责任。共同社认为，对中国的问题，“成为新内阁必须首先处理的一个大问题”。在大选揭晓以后，日本各界人士纷纷发表谈话，一致要求日本政府采取恢复日中邦交的措施。据共同社报道，日本贸易界希望新政府将制定明确的外交政策，解决中日贸易问题和解除美国对日本的进口限制。
    一位二十五岁的日本女职员向“每日新闻”发表录音谈话指出，岸信介政府如果以为它的对中国的政策在大选中获得了群众的支持，那是大错特错。她说，日本青年要求改变向美国一边倒的外交政策。她的呼声反映了日本广泛阶层人民的要求。
    岸信介企图把破坏中日关系的责任推到中国身上的做法是枉费心机的。
    日本人民要求岸信介反省他的讨好美国、敌视中国的错误政策。岸信介自知他不可能完全规避中日关系问题，因此，他在24日的记者招待会上重弹老调说，“虽然不承认共产党中国，但是，为了促进贸易，将给予一切便利。这个方针并不改变。”岸信介这种以“促进贸易”为幌子，进行破坏中日关系和中日贸易的把戏早已被戳穿了。他现在老调重弹，还想在日本人民当中制造一些幻想，继续进行欺骗，这是徒劳的。
    岸信介在记者招待会上还表示，他将继续执行把日本变成美国核武器基地的政策。他公然反对发表禁止日本实行核武装的宣言，并且硬说发表这种宣言是“不适当”的。
    岸信介同时对日本国内争取独立、和平、民主的运动进行诬蔑，并且表示要对各种人民运动进行“坚决斗争”。
    岸信介政府和自由民主党已经在24日初步商定，将在6月10日召开新选出的众议院特别会议，为岸信介重新组阁和自由民主党垄断国会各种领导职务的计划完成法律手续，以便放手推行各种反动政策。在大选中遭到打击的岸信介集团，正在拉拢各种亲美和反动的派系和人物。岸信介在24日再次表示，他将把极端亲美的池田勇人拉入他的新内阁。据时事通讯社透露，岸信介打算让声名狼借的前首相芦田均担任众议院议长。同时，自由民主党还在积极活动拉拢保守的无党派众议员参加自由民主党。岸信介集团并且一再宣称，自由民主党将包办众议院的议长和各种常设委员会的领导职位。岸信介组织更加向美国一边倒的新政府，是并不能使违反日本人民意志的反动政权稳定下来的。相反地，岸信介的新内阁将遭到日本人民更强烈的反对。岸信介也不能消除日本统治集团内部的纷争。共同社认为，在大选中更加激烈起来的自由民主党内部的派系斗争，“不会那么简单地消除”。
    日本共产党领导人已经号召日本人民继续展开斗争，击破即将成立的岸信介新内阁的各种阴谋。社会党在24日表示反对自由民主党包办众议院的各种领导职务。社会党要求按照过去的办法，由社会党议员担任众议院副议长，并且要求按照议席的比例由社会党保有相应数量的众议院各常任委员会委员长的职位。
