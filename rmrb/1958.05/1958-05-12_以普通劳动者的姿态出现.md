　　Appearing as Ordinary Laborers

　　The Governor Dines at a Farmer's Home

　　Not long ago, the "October Commune" was abuzz with good news: Governor Zhang led the Hubei Provincial Party Committee's agricultural production inspection team, Huanggang branch, to Wangcheng Township in Xishui County.

　　Granny Zhang was preparing lunch by the stove when she heard that Governor Zhang was coming to her house for lunch. She was very excited and said:

　　"I haven't prepared any dishes, how can that be!"

　　Just then, her son, commune director Rao Xingli, led five or six comrades into the house. Granny Zhang squinted and smiled, scrutinizing them for a long time. Seeing that the comrades were all dressed similarly, she couldn't identify which one was Governor Zhang. Her son, Rao Xingli, introduced: "Mom! This is our Governor Zhang." She opened her eyes and looked at him, and Governor Zhang greeted her with a smile: "Hello, old lady!"

　　"Hello."

　　"We're here to bother you, eating lunch at your house."

　　"The countryside only has green vegetables and tofu, just a simple home-cooked meal!"

　　"That's great, I love these things."

　　Seeing that she was busy preparing the meal alone, Governor Zhang quickly squatted down by the stove and added firewood for her, and chatted warmly:

　　"Old lady, how is your family's life?"

　　"Thanks to Chairman Mao, after joining the commune, each year is better than the last."

　　"Old lady, you are so happy! Look at how chubby all your grandchildren are!" Governor Zhang said, playfully pinching the little grandson's cheek, and the children smiled happily at the governor.

　　When it was time to eat, Governor Zhang personally took bowls and chopsticks and served rice, just like a member of the family.

　　When Governor Zhang was leaving, he bid farewell to Granny Zhang, saying, "Old lady, sorry to have bothered you, I'll come visit you again next year if I have the chance." All of this made Granny Zhang so excited that she almost shed tears. Governor Zhang had already gone far away, but she was still staring at Governor Zhang's back in a daze.

　　The First Night on the Line

　　On this night shift, a worker covered in grease arrived at the printing workshop of the Shanghai No. 1 Printing Factory. Worker Lin Yongnian glanced at him, thinking, "This person's face looks familiar, like I've seen him somewhere before." He went closer and was stunned: it was Deputy Party Secretary Sun Zhenyu. Sun Zhenyu was a newly accepted apprentice of master craftsman Xu Hongfa, and tonight was Sun Zhenyu's first night on the line.

　　As soon as Sun Zhenyu started his shift and was about to wash the rubber, worker Ji Furong said: "Leave it, we'll wash it!" As soon as Sun Zhenyu was about to start knocking down paper, worker Yang Shoucheng said, "Secretary Sun, you don't know how to do that, let us do it!" Sun Zhenyu couldn't hold back and said to master craftsman Xu Hongfa: "Then, what should I do?" The workers all laughed. Sun Zhenyu said: "Now, you shouldn't treat me as a leader, you should treat me as an apprentice." Seeing that the Party Secretary was so sincere, the workers finally felt comfortable letting him do the work.

　　On the Party Secretary's first night of working on the line, a new atmosphere appeared in production. The production quota for the printing press operated by Xu Hongfa was 17,800 sheets, but that night shift reached 19,000 sheets.

　　以普通劳动者的姿态出现
    省长在农家做客
    不久以前，十月社传遍了一件喜事——张省长率领的中共湖北省委农业生产检查团黄冈分团来到了浠水县望城乡。
    张婆婆正在锅台边弄午饭，听说张省长要到她家里来吃午饭，心里很激动，她说：
    “我什么菜也没办，那怎么好呢！”
    正说着，她的儿子、社主任饶兴礼引着五、六个同志到家里来了。张婆婆眯着笑眼，端详了半天，见这些同志衣服穿的不差上下，也认不出哪一位是张省长。还是儿子饶兴礼给她介绍：“妈！这位就是我们的张省长”，她睁着眼睛望着，张省长笑容满面向她打招呼：“老人家你好！”
    “好。”
    “我们要打扰你，在你家吃午饭。”
    乡下只有青菜、豆腐，家常便饭啊！”
    “这很好，这些东西，我顶喜欢吃。”
    张省长见她一个人弄饭，显得很忙碌，忙蹲在灶门口，替她添柴火，又亲热地攀谈着：
    “老人家，你家生活过得么样？”
    “托毛主席的福，入了社，一年更比一年强。”
    “老人家可幸福啦！看你孙子一个个都长得很胖哩！”张省长一边说一边逗着小孙孙的脸蛋，孩子们也望着省长幸福地咧嘴笑了。
    端饭吃的时候，张省长又像自家人一样亲自拿碗筷、盛饭。
    张省长临走时，还向张婆婆告别说：“老人家，打扰了，下年有机会再来看望你。”这一切，使张婆婆激动得差点要掉下眼泪来。张省长已走了很远，她还出神地望着张省长的背影。

    跟班第一夜
    这天夜班上工，上海市印刷一厂印刷车间新来了一个满身油垢的工人。工人林永年朝他瞟了一眼，心里想：“这个人的面孔好熟，好像在那里见过似的。”走近去一看，他呆住了：原来这是党委副书记孙振玉。孙振玉是徐洪发老师傅新收的艺徒，今天是孙振玉实行跟班劳动的第一夜。
    孙振玉上了班，正要动手洗橡皮，工人纪福荣说：“你放着，我们洗吧！”孙振玉刚要动手敲纸头，工人杨守成说：“孙书记，你不会敲的，让我们来干吧！”孙振玉憋不住了，他对徐洪发老师傅说：“那么，我做什么呢？”说得工人都笑了。孙振玉说：“现在，你们不应当把我当作领导，应当把我当作艺徒。”工人同志看到党委书记这样诚心诚意，才放心地把生活交给他去做了。
    党委书记跟班劳动的第一夜，生产上就出现了新气象。徐洪发操作的这台印刷机，生产定额是一万七千八百张，这天夜班就达到了一万九千张。
