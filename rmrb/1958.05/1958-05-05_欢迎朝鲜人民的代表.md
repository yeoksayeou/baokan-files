The People's Delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, coming to our country for a friendly visit, arrived in Beijing yesterday. The representatives of the Korean people brought the deep friendship of the Korean people to the people of our country. The cordial feelings shown by the people of our country in welcoming the distinguished Korean guests also show that the people of our country and the Korean people are as close as brothers. This visit by the Korean People's Delegation will further strengthen this brotherly friendship and solidarity between the Chinese and Korean people.

The Korean people are a diligent and courageous people. The Korean people have made great achievements in the struggle against aggression and in peaceful construction. In the great Fatherland Liberation War, the Korean people defended the independence and freedom of their motherland and safeguarded peace in the Far East and the world with unparalleled heroism and firm confidence. Three years of war caused extremely serious damage to Korea. However, the heroic Korean people did not bow to difficulties. Under the leadership of the Korean Workers' Party and with the support of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal socialist countries, they rebuilt their motherland and homes from almost complete ruins. The Korean people successfully completed the post-war Three-Year Plan and the first year of the Five-Year Plan for the People's Economy. The people's economy, which suffered severe damage from the war, has been rapidly restored and developed. Today, the industrial and agricultural production of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has greatly exceeded the pre-war level of 1949. Korean industry has increased to 2.8 times that of the pre-war period. Korea has also achieved cooperativization in agriculture, with more than 95% of farmers participating in agricultural cooperatives nationwide. Last year, Korean agriculture achieved an all-round bumper harvest. Cultural and educational undertakings have been developed accordingly, and people's living standards have been continuously improved. These great achievements powerfully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system established in the northern half of Korea. The strong will and hard-working spirit shown by the Korean people in the struggle against aggression and in peaceful construction are examples for our people to learn from.

The people of China and Korea have a traditional and profound friendship. This friendship has been tested in the long-term common struggle against aggression and is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism. In the struggle against US imperialist aggression, the outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese and Korean people further consolidated and developed this friendship with their blood. The stories of internationalist fighters Luo Shengjiao and Park Jae-geun, which are widely circulated among the people of our two countries, are symbols of the friendship between our two countries forged with blood. In the war against aggression, the Korean people not only defended the independence of their country but also guaranteed the security of our country and gave significant support to our country's socialist construction. In recent years, our two countries have extensively carried out cooperation in economic, cultural, scientific, and technological fields and have provided fraternal assistance to each other. In international affairs, the two countries also cooperate closely and support each other. The development and consolidation of friendly relations between the people of China and Korea is an important force for promoting the socialist construction of the two countries and strengthening the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and it is of great significance for maintaining peace in the Far East and the world.

The Chinese government and people have always actively promoted the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. In February of this year, the Chinese government delegation headed by Premier Zhou Enlai visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. During the visit, in order to promote the realization of the various proposals put forward by the Korean government for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from North and South Korea and the peaceful reunification of Korea, the Chinese government delegation consulted with the Korean government on the withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The Chinese People's Volunteers agreed and decided to withdraw from Korea in batches before the end of 1958. The first batch of Chinese People's Volunteers has now returned to the motherland. This proactive measure once again demonstrates the utmost sincerity of the Chinese and Korean sides in seeking a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and easing tensions in the Far East, and it demonstrates the full confidence of the Chinese and Korean people in maintaining world peace. However, the US aggressors still occupy South Korea and refuse to withdraw, seriously threatening peace in Korea and hindering the realization of peaceful reunification of Korea.

During the visit of the Korean People's Delegation to our country, they will go to the Northeast region to visit the Korean war orphans who are being cared for and educated with our help. As everyone knows, the US imperialists launched the war of aggression against Korea, causing thousands of Korean children to lose their parents and become war orphans. Since 1952, more than 22,000 Korean war orphans have come to our country. According to the agreement between the Chinese and Korean governments, Korean war orphans will be cared for and educated by our country until the end of 1958. For six years, through the joint efforts of the Chinese government and the Korean Children's Education Office, these war orphans have had better living and learning conditions, and they have been cured of the diseases and injuries inflicted on them by the US aggressors, enabling them to develop and grow normally on the basis of regaining their health, and they have received a good education. The Chinese government and the Chinese people regard caring for and educating Korean war orphans as a glorious internationalist obligation and as a due responsibility to strengthen the brotherly friendship between the Chinese and Korean people. At the same time, we also have many shortcomings in our work of caring for and educating Korean war orphans. Now, we are preparing to work hard to do a good job in repatriating Korean war orphans in batches before the end of 1958, in order to better fulfill this glorious internationalist obligation.

At the time of the visit of the representatives of the Korean people to our country, we once again express our wish to strengthen the brotherly friendship between the people of China and Korea. May the friendship between the people of China and Korea flow endlessly like the Yalu River! May the people of China and Korea unite more closely in the common cause of building socialism and defending world peace!

### 欢迎朝鲜人民的代表

    欢迎朝鲜人民的代表
    到我国来作友好访问的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国人民访华代表团，已经在昨日抵达北京。朝鲜人民的代表们带来了朝鲜人民对我国人民的深厚友谊。我国人民在欢迎朝鲜贵宾们所表现的亲切感情，也说明我国人民同朝鲜人民是亲如兄弟的。朝鲜人民访华代表团这次访问，必将进一步加强中朝两国人民这种兄弟般的友谊和团结。
    朝鲜人民是勤劳勇敢的人民。朝鲜人民在反侵略斗争中和和平建设中已经取得巨大成就。在伟大的祖国解放战争中，朝鲜人民以无比的英勇气概和坚强的信心，捍卫了自己祖国的独立和自由，维护了远东和世界的和平。三年的战争使朝鲜遭受了极其严重的破坏。然而，英勇的朝鲜人民并未向困难低头。他们在朝鲜劳动党的领导下，在苏联、中国和其他社会主义兄弟国家的支援下，从几乎是废墟中重建自己的祖国和家园。朝鲜人民胜利地完成了战后三年计划和五年计划的第一年人民经济计划。遭受战争的严重破坏的人民经济，得到了迅速的恢复和发展。今天，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的工业和农业生产都已经大大超过了战前1949年的水平。朝鲜的工业已提高到战前的二点八倍。朝鲜在农业方面也已经实现了合作化，全国95％以上的农户都已经参加了农业合作社。去年朝鲜农业获得了全面大丰收。文化教育事业得到了相应的发展，人民生活得到了不断的提高。这些巨大的成就，有力地证明了朝鲜北半部建立的社会主义制度具有无比的优越性。朝鲜人民在反侵略斗争中和和平建设中所表现的坚强意志和苦干精神，是我国人民学习的榜样。
    中朝两国人民有着传统的深厚的友谊。这种友谊在长期的反抗侵略的共同斗争中经过了考验，而且是建立在马克思列宁主义原则的基础之上的。在反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争中，中朝人民的优秀儿女更用鲜血进一步巩固和发展了这种友谊。在我们两国人民中间广泛流传的国际主义战士罗盛教和朴在根的故事，是我们两国人民鲜血凝成的友谊的象征。朝鲜人民在反侵略战争中，不仅捍卫了自己国家的独立，而且也保障了我国的安全，对我国的社会主义建设事业给予了重大的支援。近年来，我们两国广泛地开展了在经济、文化、科学和技术方面的合作，并且互相给予兄弟般的援助。在国际事务中，两国也密切合作和互相支持。中朝两国人民之间的友好关系的发展和巩固，是促进两国社会主义建设和加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的重要力量，对于维护远东和世界和平具有重大的意义。
    中国政府和人民一向积极促进朝鲜问题的和平解决。今年2月间，以周恩来总理为首的中国政府代表团访问了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国。在访问期间，为了促使朝鲜政府提出的从南北朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平统一朝鲜的各项建议的实现，中国政府代表团同朝鲜政府协商了有关中国人民志愿军从朝鲜撤出的问题。中国人民志愿军同意，并且决定在1958年年底以前分批全部撤出朝鲜。现在第一批中国人民志愿军已经撤回祖国。这一主动的措施，再一次表明了中朝方面谋求和平解决朝鲜问题和缓和远东紧张局势的最大诚意，显示了中朝两国人民对于维护世界和平的充分信心。但是，美国侵略者至今仍然盘踞在南朝鲜不肯撤走，严重地威胁着朝鲜的和平，同时阻碍着朝鲜和平统一的实现。
    朝鲜人民访华代表团访问我国期间，将前往东北地区探视由我国帮助抚养和教育的朝鲜战灾孤儿。大家知道，美帝国主义发动侵朝战争，使成千上万的朝鲜儿童失去了父母成为战灾孤儿。从1952年开始，前来我国的朝鲜战灾孤儿共有二万二千多名。根据中朝两国政府的协议，朝鲜战灾孤儿将由我国抚养和教育到1958年年底为止。六年来，经过我国政府和朝鲜儿童教育处的共同努力，这些战灾孤儿都有了较好的生活条件和学习条件，并且医治了美国侵略者所加于他们身上的疾病和创伤，使他们在恢复健康的基础上，得到了正常的发育成长，受到了良好的教育。中国政府和中国人民把抚养和教育朝鲜战灾孤儿看作是光荣的国际主义的义务，看作是加强中朝人民的兄弟友谊的应尽的责任。同时，我们在抚养和教育朝鲜战灾孤儿的工作中也有不少的缺点。现在，我们准备努力做好朝鲜战灾孤儿在1958年年底前分批回国的工作，以更好地完成这项光荣的国际主义的义务。
    在朝鲜人民的代表们访问我国的时候，我们再一次表示加强中朝两国人民兄弟友谊的祝愿。愿中朝两国人民的友谊像鸭绿江一样长流不息！愿中朝两国人民在建设社会主义和保卫世界和平的共同事业中团结得更加紧密！
