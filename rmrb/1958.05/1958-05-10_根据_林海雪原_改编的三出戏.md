    Three Plays Adapted from "Tracks in the Snowy Forest"
    On the capital's theatrical stage, three plays in different forms—Peking Opera, Ping Opera, and spoken drama—adapted from Qu Bo's novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest" have appeared one after another.
    The Peking Opera and Ping Opera both use the script "Wise Capture of Bandit Chief Vulture Mountain" adapted by the Beijing Municipal Opera and Drama Creation Committee. It mainly depicts the section where the reconnaissance hero Yang Zirong penetrates into the bandit den. The performance by the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe has a folk legend flavor, drawing on some experience from the Peking Opera "The White Haired Girl" in portraying modern life, and the performance is very popular with audiences. The Beijing Ping Opera Troupe performed this play with male roles as the center, which is a gratifying attempt.
    The "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy" performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, in addition to reflecting the People's Liberation Army's bandit suppression activities, also focuses on depicting the flesh-and-blood relationship between the army and the people.

    根据“林海雪原”改编的三出戏
    在首都的戏剧舞台上，相继出现了以京剧、评剧和话剧三出不同形式、根据曲波的小说“林海雪原”改编的戏。
    京剧和评剧采用的是北京市戏曲编导委员会改编的剧本“智擒惯匪座山雕”演出的。它主要是表现侦察英雄杨子荣深入匪窟这一段内容。北京京剧团的演出，具有民间传奇色彩，吸取了京剧“白毛女”表现现代生活的一些经验，演出很受观众欢迎。北京市评剧团以男角为中心演出了这个戏，是一个可喜的尝试。
    北京人民艺术剧院上演的“智取威虎山”，除了反映人民解放军的剿匪活动以外，还着重描写了军民之间的血肉关系。
