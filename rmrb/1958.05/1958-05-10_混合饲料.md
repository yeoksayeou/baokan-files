    Mixed Feed
    Increasing the supply of feed and serving agricultural production is an important task for the food industry. Many oil factories are mixing peanut shells, eggshell powder, and other materials that were previously impossible to utilize alone with distillers' grains, various oil cakes, bran cakes, and carrots to produce mixed feed to support pig farming in rural areas. This feed has a high nutritional value. This year, the oil industry plans to produce 780,000 tons of mixed feed. This feed can raise 780,000 pigs, yielding 62.4 million catties of pork, and accumulate 3.1 billion catties of fertilizer, increasing grain production by 156 million catties, accumulating a total of 31.2 million yuan in funds for the country.

    混合饲料
    增加饲料供应，为农业生产服务，是食品工业的一项重要任务。很多油厂把过去不可能单独利用的花生壳、蛋壳粉等和酒糟、各种油饼、糠饼、胡萝卜混在一起，制成混合饲料，支援农村养猪。这种饲料的营养价值很高。今年油脂工业计划生产七十八万吨混合饲料，用这些饲料可以养猪七十八万头，可得猪肉六千二百四十万斤，还可以积肥三十一亿斤，增产粮食一点五六亿斤，总共可为国家积累资金三千一百二十万元。（附图片）
