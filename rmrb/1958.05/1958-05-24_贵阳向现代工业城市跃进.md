Guiyang Leaps Towards a Modern Industrial City
By our reporters Wu Zhenquan, He Yongfeng, and Zhao Jialie

As the motherland enters the first half of the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, Guiyang City, the capital of Guizhou Province, historically known for its barren land and impoverished people, has begun to leap towards becoming a modern industrial city. The city's 600,000 people are full of confidence, carrying out the "Double-Anti" campaign in depth while launching large-scale industrial construction.

In the more than ten-kilometer zone from the urban area to the beautiful Huaxi Park in the suburbs, a place that was peaceful a few months ago, has undergone tremendous changes. The Guiyang Iron Manufacturing Plant, which can produce tens of thousands of tons of cast iron, steel iron, and non-ferrous metal iron parts every year; the Motor Factory, which can produce various types of generators, engines, and transformers; the Wire Factory, which can produce lead wire, galvanized iron wire, yarn-covered wire, and copper wire; and the Lathe Factory, which can produce thousands of drilling machines, planers, lathes, and milling machines, have all selected sites here and started construction. In the past few days, cranes with giant arms have been rotating on the construction sites. Thousands of construction workers are stepping up the excavation of foundations. Large trucks loaded with various construction materials are raising dust as they speed along the roads leading to various construction sites. The construction of these new factories will lay the foundation for Guiyang's modern machinery industry and become a base for Guizhou Province to develop local industries and provide new equipment in the future.

Guizhou Province has never smelted steel in its history. The Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, with an annual output of 40,000 tons of various types of steel, has begun construction in the southern suburbs of Guiyang City. This steel plant is expected to start partial production in the second quarter of next year. After this steel plant is put into production, it will make full use of the rich iron ore reserves near Guiyang. At that time, it will not only be able to provide part of the steel for the booming machinery industry and existing small factories, but also change the unreasonable phenomenon of transporting pig iron and ferro-manganese from Guizhou, and then transporting steel back from Anshan, Taiyuan, and other places thousands of kilometers away.

Simultaneously with the Guiyang Iron and Steel Plant, a cotton textile factory is being built adjacent to it. It will have 54,000 spindles and 1,000 looms, and will be able to produce 50,000 bales of yarn and weave more than 1.1 million bolts of cloth annually after completion. At that time, if the total annual output of cloth is used to make clothes, half of the people in Guizhou Province will each be able to get a set.

Guizhou Province has to import a batch of chemical fertilizers from other provinces every year, but the province's rich underground phosphate reserves have not been fully utilized. Now, in an open field in the northeastern suburbs of Guiyang City, a chemical fertilizer plant using mechanized production is under construction. It will be partially put into production in the third quarter of next year. After it is fully put into production, it will use the high-quality Kaiyang phosphate ore, which is more than 100 kilometers away from the plant, to produce hundreds of thousands of tons of superphosphate and other chemical fertilizers for the people in mountainous areas. In this area, there are also seven or eight factories, such as artificial fiber factories and plastic factories, which are being prepared for construction. The person in charge of Guiyang's capital construction units said that the city will build more than 70 factories this year.

While vigorously building large and medium-sized factories, Guiyang City is also actively renovating and expanding existing factories and mines. The Guiyang Power Machinery Factory, which used to mainly produce parts such as pistons and bearings, will have a much larger expansion area this year than the original factory buildings, and production will shift from manufacturing parts to the production of complete sets of machinery and equipment. After the expansion of the Transportation Machinery Repair and Assembly Plant, due to the great increase in equipment, it will be able to produce three-wheeled vehicles in batches. The Guizhou Agricultural Tool Factory, which previously had difficulty producing even double-wheeled double-share plows, will also be expanded into an agricultural machinery factory mainly producing small general-purpose tractors.

Guiyang's industrial production was extremely backward in the past. Before liberation, there were only a dozen dilapidated small factories in the city relying on manual operation, which could not produce any complete small machines, and even precision machine parts could not be made. The annual total output value was less than 10 million yuan. After liberation, especially during the First Five-Year Plan period, although some new factories were built and the old factories were reorganized and expanded, making production about ten times higher than before liberation, due to the small amount of modern industry and the excessively weak industrial base, the backwardness of industry has not been changed. After the factories that started construction this year are completed and put into production, this situation will be greatly changed. (Attached Picture)

    贵阳向现代工业城市跃进
    本报记者　吴振全　贺永丰　赵家烈
    当祖国进入社会主义第二个五年计划头一年的上半年，历史上以地瘠民贫著称的贵州的省会——贵阳市，开始了向现代工业城市的飞跃。全市六十万人民正满怀信心，一面深入开展双反运动，一面展开规模巨大的工业建设。
    从城区到市郊风景优美的花溪公园的十多公里地带，几月前还是一片宁静的地方，现在起了巨大的变化。每年能生产几万吨铸铁、铁钢和有色金属铁件的贵阳铁造厂，能生产各种型号发电机、发动机、变压器的电机厂，能生产铅线、镀锌铁线、纱包线和铜线的电线厂，能生产几千台钻床、刨床、车床和铣床的车床厂，都已在这里选定了厂址，开始动工兴建。这几天，伸出巨臂的起重机，已在工地上转动起来。数以千计的建筑工人，正在加紧挖基下石。满载着各种建筑器材的大卡车，卷起阵阵尘土，奔驶于通向各个工地的道路上。这些新厂的兴建，将奠下贵阳市现代机械工业的基础，成为贵州省今后发展地方工业提供新式设备的基地。
    贵州省有史以来没有炼过钢。年产四万吨各种钢材的贵阳钢铁厂，已在贵阳市南郊动工兴建。这座钢铁厂预计在明年第二季度开始局部投入生产。这座钢铁厂投入生产后，将使贵阳附近藏量丰富的铁矿，得到充分利用。那时，它不仅能为正在蓬勃发展的机械工业和旧有小型工厂提供一部分钢材，而且将改变过去从贵州运出生铁，锰铁，然后又从数千公里以外的鞍山、太原等地运回钢材的不合理现象。
    和贵阳钢铁厂同时开始兴建并相毗邻的是一座棉纺厂，它将拥有五万四千个纱锭和一千台织布机，建成后每年能生产五万件纱，织一百一十多万匹布。那时如把布的年产总量用来缝成衣服，贵州省有一半的人能各得到一套。
    贵州省每年都要从外省运进一批化学肥料，但是本省地下藏量丰富的磷矿，却未得到充分利用。现在在贵阳市东北郊的一片旷野上，一座利用机械化生产的化学肥料厂，正在大兴土木。明年第三季度就要局部投入生产。全部投入生产后，每年就将利用离这个厂一百多公里远的量大质高的开阳磷矿的矿石，来为山区人民生产数十万吨重过磷酸钙等化学肥料。就在这一带，还有人造纤维厂、塑料厂等七、八个工厂正在筹备兴建。贵阳市基本建设单位的负责人说，今年全市要兴建的工厂有七十多个。
    贵阳市在大力兴建大、中型工厂的同时，还积极改建和扩建已有的厂矿。过去以生产活塞、轴承等部件为主的贵阳动力机械厂，今年扩建部分要比原有厂房大得多，生产将由制造零件转向成台机器设备的生产。交通机械修配厂扩建后，由于设备的大大增加，就能成批生产三轮汽车。过去生产双轮双铧犁都有困难的贵州农具厂，也将扩建成以生产小型万能拖拉机为主的农业机械工厂。
    贵阳市以前工业生产是极为落后的。在解放前，全市只有十多个破烂的依靠手工操作的小型工厂，不能生产任何成件的小机器，连精密的机器配件也做不出，每年生产总值不到一千万元。解放后，特别是在第一个五年计划期间，虽然新建了一些工厂，并对旧有的工厂进行了改组和扩建，使生产比解放前增加了十倍左右，但是，由于现代工业很少和旧有工业底子过分薄弱，仍然没有改变工业落后的面貌。今年开工新建的工厂建成投入生产后，这种情况就将大大改变。（附图片）
