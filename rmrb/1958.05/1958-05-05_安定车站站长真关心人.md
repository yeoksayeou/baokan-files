    An Ding Train Station Master Truly Cares About People
    On April 25th, Comrade Wu from the Huangcun Forestry Technical School, who had been sent down to the Guangming Agricultural Cooperative in Qingyundian, Daxing County, contracted acute appendicitis. Because the nearby hospital couldn't perform the surgery, the agricultural cooperative quickly transported Comrade Wu to An Ding Train Station by cart, intending to take a train to Beijing for treatment. Unfortunately, the train to Beijing had just left. The next train was an express train, which didn't stop at An Ding Station. They would have to wait until after 2:00 AM for the next train. Comrade Wu's condition was critical, and the comrades escorting him were worried that the delay in treatment would lead to danger, so they urgently sought help from the station master. The station master was very concerned and immediately called the Railway Administration to request that Express Train 52, traveling from Tianjin to Beijing, stop at An Ding Station for one minute. His request was approved by the Railway Administration. As a result, Comrade Wu was able to smoothly board the express train to Beijing and get timely treatment at the hospital.
    The service spirit of the An Ding Train Station Master and the Railway Administration in caring for and looking after patients is truly touching. We are writing this letter to commend them. 　Guan Zhizhong (Attached Image)

    安定车站站长真关心人
    4月25日，黄村林业技术学校下放到大兴县青云店光明农业社的吴同志得了急性盲肠炎，由于附近医院不能动手术，农业社赶忙用大车把吴同志送到安定车站，准备乘火车去北京治疗。但是不巧得很，去北京的火车刚开，下次列车是特别快车，在安定车站又不停车，必须等到下半夜两点多钟才有车。吴同志的病势紧急，护送的同志怕耽误治疗时间发生危险，就急忙找站长商量。站长很关心，立刻给管理局打电话要求从天津开往北京的五十二次快车在安定车站停一分钟。他的要求得到了管理局的同意。因此吴同志能顺利地乘上快车到北京及时进医院治疗。
    安定车站站长和铁路管理局这种关心和照顾病人的服务精神，实在令人感动，特写信表扬。　关治中（附图片）
