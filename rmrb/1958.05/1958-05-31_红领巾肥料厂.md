    Young Pioneer Fertilizer Factory
    (This newspaper reports) “Increase production through fertilizer, build a fortune through water conservancy,” these are the two goals of Xinmin County, Liaoning Province in achieving the “ten thousand jin county” target. The Young Pioneers are young but have great ambitions. While supporting water conservancy, they are determined to support agricultural production more forcefully with manure fertilizer. Therefore, they consulted their counselors and visited agricultural technicians at the service station, and finally overcame the difficulties and established a Young Pioneer granular fertilizer factory. This factory officially went into production on April 1.
    This factory can produce 300 jin of fertilizer per hour. It has five workshops: raw material fermentation, pulverization, mixing, finished products, and drying, as well as a storage room that can hold 50,000 jin of finished products. These were all built by the Young Pioneers with their own hands. The factory has disinfection equipment; the rest room also has children's newspapers and reading materials. Now, the young workers have mastered the production technology skillfully. They can freely apply the ratio of various raw materials, the consistency of the mixing, and the timing of finished products. (Zhao Hongtao)

    红领巾肥料厂
    本报讯　“粪上增产，水上起家”，这是辽宁省新民县实现万斤县的两个奋斗目标。少先队员们人小雄心大。他们在支援水利化的同时，决心要在粪肥上更有力地支援农业生产。因此，他们请教了辅导员，访问了服务站的农业技术员叔叔，终于克服了困难，建立了一座红领巾颗粒肥工厂。这座厂在4月1日正式投入了生产。
    这座工厂每小时能生产三百斤肥料，有原料发酵、粉碎、拌料、制成品、晾晒五个车间和能藏五万斤成品的储藏室，这些都是少先队员们用自己的双手建造起来的。厂内有消毒用具；休息室还有儿童的报刊读物。现在，小工人们都熟练地掌握了生产技术。各种原料的比例，拌料的稀干，制成品的时间，他们都能运用自如。　（赵洪涛）
