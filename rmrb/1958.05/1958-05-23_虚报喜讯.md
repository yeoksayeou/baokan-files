    False Reports of Good News

    Recently, just as American economists, newspapers, and businesses have been increasingly pessimistic and admitting that the American economic "recession" cannot be ended in the short term, the US President has once again falsely reported "good news." On May 20, Eisenhower announced at the Economic Mobilization Conference of the American Enterprise Association that the improvement of the national economy was "in the process of forming." In order to make Americans believe that his words this time were reliable, he particularly emphasized: "I have no doubt about this." However, following this, the President appealed to the American business community, asking them to "invest in machinery and equipment now instead of waiting to do so later."

    Eisenhower had previously advised Americans to "buy now." The workers in Springfield responded, "Eisenhower said we should buy things now, tell us what to buy them with." So advising the workers inevitably ran into a brick wall. Now he is imploring the business community to "invest now," revealing his anxiety. It seems that his claim that "the situation is improving" is not something he "has no doubt about."

    虚报喜讯
    最近，当美国的经济学者、报刊和企业界都越来越悲观地承认美国经济“衰退”已非短期可以结束的时候，美国总统又虚报起“喜讯”来了。5月20日，艾森豪威尔在美国企业协会经济动员会议上宣布：国民经济的好转正“在形成过程中”。为了要使美国人相信他这次的话可靠，他还特别强调说：“我对这点是毫没有怀疑的”。然而跟着这位总统就向美国企业界呼吁，要求他们“现在就在机器和设备方面投资而不要等到以后再去做”。
    艾森豪威尔不久前曾劝告过美国人要“现在就买”，斯普林菲尔德的工人曾回答道：“艾森豪威尔说现在应该买东西，告诉我们用什么来买”，所以劝告工人就不能不碰了钉子；现在他又祈求企业界“现在就投资”，情急可见。看来，他的“情况在好转”的说法倒不是“毫没有怀疑的”。
