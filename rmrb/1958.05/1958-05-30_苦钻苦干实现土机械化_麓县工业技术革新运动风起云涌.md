Reported by our correspondents Zhou Jingyu and Zhang Jiecun: Under the slogan of vigorously reforming production tools and innovating technology, the workers of ?Lü County's local industries in Yunnan have given full play to their creativity. Over 90% of production tools have been reformed, and 50% of these tools have been indigenously mechanized.

Last year, the county's total industrial output value was 6.5 million yuan, with a total of more than 2,200 workers. This year's planned total output value is 21 million yuan. If calculated according to the original production tools and efficiency, it would require an increase of 50,000 yuan in equipment and 4,800 workers. However, due to the improvement of tools and the unleashing of production potential, the result was only an increase of more than 10,000 yuan in equipment and more than 1,300 temporary workers. They used water power as a driving force for tool reform. The Dalu South Iron Smelting Plant adopted water turbine blowers, each of which can replace twenty-four laborers. The paper mill adopted water turbine pulping machines, each of which can replace thirty-six laborers. In the past, the gunpowder factory required four people to operate a stone mortar, but now using a water turbine, each turbine can drive twelve stone mortars, saving forty-eight laborers. They have also created many foot-pedaled and hand-cranked indigenous machines. An old worker from the No. 2 District Farm Implement Factory created a foot-pedaled indigenous steam hammer, which increased work efficiency by eight times. The No. 1 District Farm Implement Factory created a foot-pedaled drilling machine, increasing efficiency seven times, and making operation very easy. This factory also created a hand-cranked lathe that can turn a three-cun-long screw in two minutes and a hand-cranked milling machine. Three hand-cranked milling machines can equal a small automatic milling machine. The Chengguan Town Wood Factory created a foot-pedaled electric dual-purpose sawing machine, with three saw blades installed on each machine, and the efficiency is more than two hundred times higher than hand sawing. The umbrella-making cooperative and the scale-making cooperative have also created wooden lathes, wooden planers, and wooden milling machines, which have increased work efficiency by fourteen times. Originally, each cooperative needed seventeen people to work; now, only three are needed. Candle factories, shredded tobacco factories, and pickled vegetable factories have also made many reforms in production tools.

Tool reforms have also generally improved production quality, and production costs have also been reduced accordingly. Last year, each horse-drawn waterwheel cost 120 yuan; this year, it has been reduced to 70 yuan. Originally, each handcart cost twelve yuan; this year, it has been reduced to six yuan. The average price of daily necessities has also decreased by 13.5%.

In the process of tool reform, workers also encountered some resistance. Some people said: "Only machines can make machines; how can handcrafting make lathes?" When the Chengguan Town Farm Implement Group was trial-producing a wooden rice mill, after the first failure, the group members had differing opinions. Some advocated giving up the experiment, while others advocated experimenting to the end. The CPC ?Lü County Committee gave strong support to those workers who dared to think and dared to act. The County Committee pointed out: "Anyone who dares to think and dares to act should be rewarded. If you succeed, we will reward your achievements; if you fail, we will reward your spirit."

Now, the workers of ?Lü County are giving full play to the spirit of hard work and are manufacturing ten kinds of machines for rural areas to replace manpower in sowing, threshing, slicing sweet potatoes, milling rice, and extracting oil with indigenous machinery. Many workshops of the county's iron factory and farm implement factory are scattered in ancient temples and dilapidated ancestral halls. The Minister of Industry of the County Committee told reporters: "The trial production and promotion of indigenous machinery have had a profound impact on all industries in the county, and reforming tools has become the main action of the people. We have no engineers, no technicians, and not even a single level-one technical worker. These indigenous machines are all created by 'extra-grade' workers."

    苦钻苦干实现土机械化
    ?麓县工业技术革新运动风起云涌
    本报讯　记者周静宇、章皆淳报道：云南?麓县地方工业的工人，在大力改革生产工具革新技术的口号下，充分发挥了创造性，90％以上的生产工具都进行了改革，其中有50％的工具已经土机械化。
    去年这个县的工业生产总值是六百五十万元，共有工人二千二百多人。今年生产总产值计划为二千一百万元，如按原来的生产工具和效率计算，就需要增加设备五万元、增加工人四千八百人。但是由于他们改良了工具，发挥了生产潜力，结果只增加了一万多元设备，一千三百多个临时工人。他们利用水力作为生产动力，来实行工具改革。大路南炼铁厂采用水轮鼓风机，每台可代替二十四个劳动力。造纸厂采用水轮打浆机，每台可代替三十六个劳动力。火药厂过去一个石碓要四个人操作，改用水轮机，每台可带动石碓十二个，节约劳动力四十八人。他们还创造了不少脚踏手摇的土机械。二区农具制造厂老工人创造了脚踏土汽锤，工作效率提高了八倍。一区农具制造厂创造了脚踏钻床，提高效率七倍，而且操作十分轻便。这个厂还创造了手摇车床，二分钟就可以车好一个三公寸长的螺丝，创造了手摇铣床，三台可抵一台小型自动铣床。城关镇木工厂创造了脚踏电动两用锯木机，每台装有三个锯盘，效率比手工拉锯高二百多倍。制伞合作社和制秤合作社，还创造了木车床、木刨床、木铣床，工作效率提高了十四倍。原来每一个社都要十七个人工作，现在只要三个就够了。其他制烛厂、烟丝厂、酱菜厂等，在生产工具上也都做了许多改革。
    工具改革还使生产质量普遍提高，生产成本也随着降低。去年马拉水车每辆要一百二十元，今年已下降为七十元，手推车原来每辆十二元，今年已下降为六元。生活日用品的平均价格也降低了13.5％。
    工人们在进行工具改革中也曾遭到了一些抵触。有的人说：“只有机器造机器，那有手工造车床。”城关镇农具小组在试制木制碾米机时，第一次失败后，组员意见分歧，有些人主张放弃试验，有些人则主张试验到底。中共?麓县委对那些敢想敢干的工人给了大力的支持。县委指出：“凡是敢想敢干的人都应该受到奖励，成功了奖动你的成绩，失败了奖励你的精神。
    现在?麓县的工人们，正在发挥苦钻苦干的精神，为农村制造十种机械，播种、打谷、薯类切片、碾米、榨油等，都用土机械代替人力。这个县的铁工厂和农具厂，有许多车间都分散在古庙和破旧的家祠里。县委工业部长对记者说：“土机械的试制和推广，已在全县各项工业中发生了深远的影响，改革工具已成为人们的主要行动。我们没有工程师、技术员、连一级的技术工人也没有一个。这些土机械都是‘级外’的工人创造的。”
