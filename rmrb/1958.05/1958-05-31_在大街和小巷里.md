　　On Streets and in Lanes
　　By our reporters Ren Zhiqiao and An Zhonghuang

　　Loving Labor is a Good Child
　　Wang Jingzhi, a first-grade elementary school student, was washing his undershirt. His mother saw this and wondered: this child used to just spit on his dirty mask and rub it, too lazy to wash it. How come he's washing his own clothes today? She couldn't help but ask, "Why are you washing your own clothes?" "Auntie from our group told us that good children should not only study well but also love labor..."
　　Wang Biqiu, the security committee member of the 11th Residents Committee of Beijing College Road, whom the children call "Auntie," organized a children's group with ten first-grade elementary school students and preschoolers in April this year. Every afternoon, the children come to Wang Biqiu's home on time to do their homework, and then they read comic books. Wang Biqiu's daughter, Yang Muping, a sixth-grade student and Young Pioneer, also teaches the children to sing, dance, and play fun games.
　　Wang Biqiu often patiently educates the children to have a labor viewpoint. She found that eight-year-old Xiao Liying loves labor, so she praised her in front of the children. When other children help with housework, she also praises them in a timely manner. She also often visits the children's homes to cooperate with the families in educating the children.
　　Love for labor has taken root in the children's hearts. Every day, they report to the group what work they have done that day. The group's record book records all kinds of labor performed by the children: sweeping the floor, dumping dirt, making fire, brushing shoes, etc.

　　Children Know to Wash Their Faces Before Bed
　　One night not long ago, the mother of Dashunzi, who lives in the Zhenwumiao North residential area, was holding Ershunzi to sleep. Dashunzi's grandmother suddenly heard the sound of someone taking a washbasin. It turned out that five-year-old Dashunzi was washing his face with cold water! His mother quickly got up to add hot water for him. Dashunzi washed his face and feet before going to bed.
　　Many children in the Zhenwumiao North residential area, like Dashunzi, have developed good hygiene habits, such as washing their faces and feet in the morning and before going to bed, and not eating dirty things. Even three-year-olds know that they have to wash small radishes clean before eating them.
　　In the wave of the Great Leap Forward for all people, the director and members of the Zhenwumiao North Residents Committee thought: How can we eliminate the four pests and promote hygiene without the children? They organized all eighty-five children aged three to seven in the entire residential area and established a children's hygiene group to educate the children to love cleanliness and pay attention to hygiene. Every Saturday morning, medical staff from the Beijing Children's Hospital give lectures to the children, teaching them how to wash their hands, how to brush their teeth, and cut their fingernails.
　　The children's hygiene habits have quickly been cultivated. Guo Jianguo, a five-year-old boy, used to always have two "buckets" of snot. His mother dragged him to wash his face as if they were fighting, but he wouldn't wash it. Now he washes his face often, and his little face is clean. The children all know that the snacks on the street stalls are not clean and will make them sick if they eat them, so no one buys anything from the stalls anymore.

　　Even Xiao Cang Has Begun to Change
　　Many residents of Erlong Road are vying to spread the word: The children's team in West Lane is so good that even Xiao Cang has been educated.
　　Speaking of Xiao Cang, a ten-year-old child who broke his leg after climbing a pile of bricks, no one in the neighborhood doesn't know him. He spends all day fighting, cursing, playing marbles, climbing rooftops, disrespecting teachers at school, and is even more unruly at home. One day, the teacher from the school came to visit the Huang family to discuss how to educate the child. As soon as Xiao Cang saw him, he panicked. "What is the teacher doing at our house? He must be joining forces with my mother to fix me." He turned his little head and immediately came up with an idea. He found a lock and locked the teacher and his mother in the house, and went out to wander the streets.
　　In March, Guo Junqing and Tian Yuying, enthusiastic housewives in West Lane, helped more than thirty children establish a children's team, and invited Luo Jiezhen, a retired veteran teacher with more than thirty years of experience in educating children, to assist in educating the children on how to be a good child anytime and anywhere.
　　Telling true stories, reading comic books, and assigning labor tasks are all lively and interesting forms that make the children's team very popular among the children. Many naughty children ask Tian Yuying after school: "Auntie Tian, what are we doing today?"
　　Xiao Cang has also begun to change. Once, Luo Jiezhen met Xiao Cang being naughty again and asked him, "Have you finished your homework?"
　　"Is that any of your business?!"
　　"Where are you studying?"
　　"In Beijing!"
　　Luo Jiezhen knew that it was not easy to transform a "wild child" and that it required long-term and patient education. Teacher Luo told him while he was being naughty: All the members of the children's team are good children. Good children should be polite, not naughty, and respect the elderly. Xiao Cang stared with his small eyes and listened to Teacher Luo without moving, thinking: It's really not good to be naughty. How good it would be if I were a good child that my mother and teacher both love! Xiao Cang was educated by his neighbors again and again in this way, and slowly began to change.
　　Now, Grandma Huang no longer has to apologize to her neighbors because Xiao Cang fights and curses. Every morning, Xiao Cang automatically gets up to sweep the streets and water the trees. When he has free time, he sits at home to study his lessons and no longer roams the streets.

　　Little Horn Listening Group
　　"Little friends, Little Horn is starting to broadcast!"
　　More than twenty children in Yida Lane gathered in front of Li Shulan's radio, widened their eyes, and listened quietly to the Central People's Broadcasting Station's programs for children.
　　Yida Lane is a hutong that is also like a large courtyard. Many families have many children and cannot take care of them all. Women's representative Yu Zhuqing saw this situation and discussed with Li Shulan, a housewife who has a radio at home, to establish a listening group. Li Shulan has five children and is very enthusiastic about establishing a listening group. She thinks: It is a good thing to have the children come to her home to listen to "Little Horn" and educate them. After their discussion, several people divided the work. Li Shulan is responsible for organizing listening to the broadcast, Yu Zhuqing is responsible for talking about hygiene common sense, Li Shulan's eldest daughter teaches gymnastics, and they also invited an old woman named Han to teach the children manners, traffic rules, and other knowledge.
　　Before and after listening to the broadcast, various activities are also carried out in the group. Old Woman Han brought books from her home and taught the children to read pictures, recognize words, and identify things. They also established contact with the Yangpishi Hutong Nursery nearby to learn experience in educating children. If they find that some children have not come, they will go to their homes to find them.
　　Every day, before the listening time, the children call each other in twos and threes to go to the listening group. They have learned many nursery rhymes and songs from the broadcast, and they also understand many principles. In the past, many children did not pay attention to hygiene and climbed coal piles, often looking like little black people. Now everyone is clean. Children who used to pick flowers and break branches at will now know to protect flowers and trees. One day at noon, Old Woman Han was reading the newspaper when five-year-old Li Jiansheng ran over.
　　"Grandma Han, Grandma Han, someone is pulling out sunflowers!"

    在大街和小巷里
    本报记者　任志樵　安仲皇
    爱劳动是好孩子
    一年级小学生王静之正在洗背心。他妈妈看见之后，纳闷地想：这孩子过去口罩脏了吐口唾沫揉擦揉擦，懒得洗，今儿个怎么自己洗起衣服来了。不禁问道：“你怎么自个儿洗衣服啦？”“我们小组大姨告诉我们说，好孩子会学习，也要会劳动。……”
    被孩子们称为大姨的北京学院胡同第十一居民委员会治安委员王碧秋在今年4月里组织了有十个一年级小学生和学龄前儿童参加的儿童小组。每天下午，孩子们按时到王碧秋家里作功课，完了还看小人书。王碧秋的女儿，六年级学生、少先队员杨牧平还教孩子们唱歌、跳舞和作有趣的游戏。
    王碧秋经常耐心地教育孩子们要有劳动观点，她发现八岁的小立英爱劳动，她就在孩子们面前夸奖她。别的孩子也帮助家里干活的时候，她也及时进行表扬。她还常常到孩子们的家里去访问，和家庭合作教育孩子。
    爱劳动已在孩子们的心里生了根，他们每天向小组报告自己一天干了什么活，小组的记录本上记载着孩子们各种各样的劳动：扫地、倒土、生火、刷鞋等等。
  孩子懂得洗了脸才睡觉
    不久前的一天晚上，住在真武庙北居民区的大顺子的妈妈搂着二顺子睡觉了。大顺子的奶奶突然听到有人拿洗脸盆的响声。原来是五岁的大顺子用凉水洗脸哪！他妈妈赶紧起来给他加上热水，大顺子洗了脸、脚才去睡觉。
    真武庙北居民区的许多孩子都像大顺子一样，养成了早起和睡觉前洗脸、洗脚和不吃脏东西等卫生习惯。连三岁的小孩都知道买了小萝卜要洗干净才能吃。
    在全民大跃进的声浪中，真武庙北居民区居民委员会主任和委员们想：除四害讲卫生离了孩子们怎么行？他们就把全居民区八十五个三周岁到七周岁的孩子组织起来，成立了儿童卫生组，教育孩子爱清洁，讲卫生。每周星期六上午，北京市儿童医院的医务人员给孩子们讲课，教孩子们怎样洗手、怎样刷牙，给孩子们剪指甲。
    孩子们的卫生习惯很快就培养起来了。五岁的男孩郭建国，过去总是两“桶”鼻涕，他妈妈像打架似的拉他洗，他也不洗，现在自己常洗脸，小脸蛋干干净净的。孩子们都知道小摊上的零食不干净，吃了要生病，所以谁也不买小摊上的东西了。
    连小仓也开始变了
    二龙路的许多居民争相传说：西巷的儿童队就是好，连小仓都教育过来了。
    提起曾经因为爬砖堆跌断腿的十岁孩子小仓，街坊四邻没有一个不知道的。他整天打架、骂人、打弹子，爬屋顶，在学校里不尊敬老师，在家里更是无法无天。有一天，学校的老师到黄家来访问，商量如何教育孩子，小仓一见，心里发慌，“老师到我们家来干什么？准是要和我妈妈联合起来整我”。他小脑袋一转，立即计上心头，找了一把锁，把老师和他妈妈锁在屋内，自己逛大街去了。
    3月间，西巷热心街道工作的家庭妇女郭俊卿、田玉英，帮助三十多个孩子成立了儿童队，请有三十多年教育孩子经验的退休老教师罗捷振协助，随时随地向孩子们进行做一个好孩子的教育。
    讲真人真事，说故事，看小人书，布置劳动等生动活泼的形式，使儿童队很受孩子们欢迎，许多淘气的孩子放学以后问田玉英：“田大妈，今天做什么？”
    小仓也开始变了。有一次，罗捷振遇见小仓又淘气了，便问他：“作业作完了吗？”
    “你管得着吗？！”
    “你在哪里学习？”
    “在北京！”
    罗捷振知道一个“野孩子”转变很不容易，需要长期的耐心的教育，罗老师乘他淘气的时候告诉他：参加儿童队的都是好孩子，好孩子要懂礼貌，不淘气，尊敬老人。小仓瞪着小眼睛动也不动地听罗老师讲话，心里想：淘气真不好，我 要是做一个妈妈、老师都爱的好孩子该多好！小仓就这样一次又一次地受到街坊四邻的教育，慢慢的开始转变了。
    现在，黄大妈再不用因为小仓打架骂人向四邻道歉。每天早晨小仓自动起来扫街、浇树。有空就坐在家里补习功课，不再上街野混了。
    小喇叭收听组
    “小朋友，小喇叭开始广播啦！”
    义达里的二十多个孩子，都聚集到李书兰家的收音机前，睁大了眼睛，静静地听着中央人民广播电台对少年儿童的广播节目。
    义达里是一条胡同，又像是一个大院子。不少人家孩子多，照顾不过来，妇女代表余祝青看到这种情况后，就和家中有收音机的家庭妇女李书兰研究成立收听组，李书兰有五个孩子，对成立收听组很热心。她想：让孩子们到自己家里来收听“小喇叭”，对他们进行一些教育是件好事情。她们一商量，几个人具体分了工，李书兰负责组织收听广播，余祝青负责讲卫生常识，李书兰的大女孩教体操，又请来一位韩老太太给孩子们讲礼貌、交通规则和别的知识。
    在收听广播前后，小组内还进行各种活动。韩老太太从自己家里拿来了图书，教孩子们看图识字认东西。她们还与附近的羊皮市胡同托儿站建立联系，学习教育孩子的经验。如果发现有的孩子没有来，她们就上他家去找。
    每天还不到收听的时间，孩子们就三三两两地互相叫着到收听组去。他们从广播中学会了不少歌谣和歌曲，也懂得不少道理。过去，许多孩子不讲卫生，爬煤堆，常常像个小黑人，现在每个人都是干干净净的，以前随便摘花折木的孩子，现在都知道保护花木了。有一天中午，韩老太太正在看报，五岁的小孩李建生飞跑过来。
    “韩奶奶，韩奶奶，有人拔向日葵啦！”
