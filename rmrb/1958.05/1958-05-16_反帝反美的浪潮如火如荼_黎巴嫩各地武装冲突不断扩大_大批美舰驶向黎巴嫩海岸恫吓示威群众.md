Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 15th: According to newspaper and radio reports, armed conflicts between demonstrators and government troops and police are expanding in Lebanon. The wave of popular protest has swept across most of the country. Traffic and telecommunications have been cut off in many areas. Many cities have been experiencing general strikes and market shutdowns for days. State organs have stopped working. Armed conflicts continue to result in many casualties.

　　In the Muslim residential areas of the capital, Beirut, residents have set up obstacles and dug trenches in the streets, and machine guns have been erected. Gunfire and explosions can be heard constantly in the city. The people's demonstrations are becoming increasingly anti-imperialist and anti-American in nature. Thousands of residents of Beirut marched to the U.S. Embassy to express their anger and protest against U.S. interference in Lebanon's internal affairs.

　　According to Beirut radio, about 300 demonstrators once occupied Beit el-Din, the hometown of Lebanese President Camille Chamoun, on the 13th. These armed demonstrators attacked and burned Chamoun's summer residence there.

　　In Baalbek, demonstrators attacked the government building and the gendarmerie headquarters.

　　In Tripoli, the second-largest city, demonstrators still control almost the entire city. Fierce street fighting took place in the suburbs. Because the oil pipeline of the Iraq Petroleum Company, mainly funded by U.S. and British capital, was blown up in northern Lebanon, work at the Tripoli refinery has been suspended. At the same time, the scale of demonstrations in Tyre and Zgharta is also very large.

　　Lebanese President Chamoun and the government are trying their best to suppress the demonstration movement and are seeking assistance from Western countries. Chamoun held secret talks with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France on the 14th for the second consecutive night. According to Damascus's "Victory" and "Al-Barada" newspapers, the U.S. ambassador assured Chamoun on the 14th that the U.S. government would help the Lebanese government "restore order."

　　The government has dispatched large numbers of troops and police to intensify the suppression of the demonstration movement. A large number of armed forces have been transferred to Tripoli, the northern coastal city where the demonstration movement first broke out.

　　Newspapers reported that the Beirut Prosecutor General issued arrest warrants on the 13th for forty prominent opposition leaders, accusing them of inciting residents to demonstrate.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 14th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Republic (UAR) rejected a note presented by the Lebanese Chargé d'Affaires to the UAR on the 14th, which stated that broadcasts from Cairo and Damascus radio stations were interfering in Lebanon's internal affairs.

　　Officials from the UAR Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Lebanese Chargé d'Affaires that the note was slanderous and defamatory and completely fabricated.

　　Xinhua News Agency, May 15th: Washington news: The U.S. government is taking all possible measures to intensify interference in the Lebanese situation.

　　According to U.S. news agencies, to plot to interfere under the guise of the United Nations, the U.S. representative to the United Nations and the British representative visited UN Secretary-General Hammarskjöld on the 14th. It is revealed that the United States is trying to quickly submit the Lebanese situation to the UN Security Council.

　　At the same time, the U.S. government openly came forward to support the Lebanese government. The U.S. State Department announced that the United States is providing the Lebanese government with so-called "police equipment," including "rifles, ammunition, pistols, and tear gas." It is reported that the U.S. government is also considering rapidly increasing "military assistance" to the Lebanese government.

　　On the same day, the U.S. Department of the Navy announced that it would double the strength of the U.S. Sixth Fleet stationed in the Mediterranean region and mobilize a large number of warships to head towards the eastern Mediterranean. U.S. Navy personnel admitted that this was to sail east to secure positions easily accessible to the Lebanese coast, two thousand miles away. It is revealed that these ships "include a full complement of ships needed for landing operations."

　　反帝反美的浪潮如火如荼
　　黎巴嫩各地武装冲突不断扩大
　　大批美舰驶向黎巴嫩海岸恫吓示威群众
    新华社大马士策15日电　据报纸和广播电台报道，黎巴嫩各地示威群众和政府军警的武装冲突正在扩大。人民群众的抗议浪潮席卷了国内大部分地区。很多地区的交通和电讯联络已经切断，许多城市几天来一直实行总罢工总罢市，国家机关停止工作，武装冲突的结果继续有许多人伤亡。
    在首都贝鲁特的穆斯林居住地区，居民在大街上布置了障碍物、挖了壕沟，架起机枪，市内可不断听到枪声和爆炸声。人民示威游行越来越具有反帝反美性质。贝鲁特成千上万的居民曾经涌向美国大使馆，对美国干涉黎巴嫩内政表示愤怒抗议。
    据贝鲁特电台广播，示威者三百人曾经在13日一度占领了黎巴嫩总统夏蒙的故乡——贝特丁市。这些武装的示威者在这里袭击并焚烧了夏蒙的避暑官邸。
    在巴尔贝克市，示威者袭击了政府大厦和宪兵司令部。
    在第二大城的黎波里，示威者仍然差不多控制着整个城市。在市郊进行了激烈的巷战。由于主要是美英资本的伊拉克石油公司的输油管，在黎巴嫩北部一度被炸毁，设在的黎波里的炼油厂的工作陷于停顿。同时，苏尔和扎加尔塔市的示威规模也很大。
    黎巴嫩总统夏蒙和政府正在竭力镇压示威运动，并且向西方国家求援。夏蒙在14日晚间接连第二天同美、英、法三国大使举行密谈。据大马士革“胜利报”和“巴拉达报”报道，美国大使在14日向夏蒙保证，美国政府将帮助黎巴嫩政府“恢复秩序”。
    政府已经派出了大批军队和警察，加紧镇压示威运动。大批武装部队被调到最早发生示威运动的北部海滨城市的黎波里。
    报纸报道，贝鲁特检察长在13日已经发出拘票逮捕四十名著名的反对党领导人；他们的罪名是煽动居民示威游行。
    新华社开罗14日电　阿拉伯联合共和国外交部14日拒绝了黎巴嫩驻阿拉伯联合共和国临时代办提出的一项照会，这项照会说，开罗和大马士革电台的广播在干涉黎巴嫩内政。
    阿拉伯联合共和国外交部官员对黎巴嫩临时代办说，这个照会是诽谤和诬蔑，是完全虚构的。
    据新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：美国政府正在采取各种可能的手段来加紧干涉黎巴嫩的局势。
    据美国通讯社报道，为了策划盗用联合国的名义进行干涉，美国驻联合国代表和英国代表14日分别访问了联合国秘书长哈马舍尔德，据透露，美国正策动把黎巴嫩局势迅速提交联合国安全理事会。
    同时，美国政府公开出面为黎巴嫩政府撑腰。美国国务院宣布，美国正在向黎巴嫩政府提供包括“步枪、弹药、手枪和催泪弹”在内的所谓“警察装备”。据报道，美国政府还在考虑迅速增加对黎巴嫩政府的“军事援助”。
    同一天，美国海军部宣布把驻在地中海地区的美国第六舰队的兵力增加一倍，并且调动大批军舰向地中海东部进发。美国海军人士承认，这是要向东开去占好容易到达两千英里外的黎巴嫩海岸的地位。据透露，这些舰只“包括登陆作战需要的全套舰只”。
