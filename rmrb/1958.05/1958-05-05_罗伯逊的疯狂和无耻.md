Robertson's Madness and Shamelessness
By Editorial Commentator

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robertson delivered a "speech" on May 2 to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee. According to him, he wanted to talk about "U.S. policy in the Far East." However, in reality, Robertson hardly said a word about the real U.S. policy in the Far East, but instead, with all his might, he launched the most vicious attacks and slanders against so-called "international communism," especially against the Chinese people. Robertson, speaking irresponsibly and without shame, actually nonsensically claimed that the Chinese people used force to "threaten" all countries along its borders, and even "invaded" China's territory of Tibet (!) In order to sensationalize, Robertson also used a completely rogue-like tone to vilify the Chinese people's government and leaders.

What on earth made Robertson so mad? Of course, Robertson is extremely hostile to the Chinese people. But he would know after all: American imperialism equipped the Kuomintang reactionaries with billions of dollars and millions of troops, wanting to overthrow the Chinese people, but the result was a complete defeat; later, American imperialism gathered the military forces of more than a dozen satellite countries, wanting to invade China from Korea, but the result was still a complete defeat. The Chinese people cannot be overthrown, so what good can slander and vilification do? Robertson understands this; the reason he frantically slanders and vilifies the Chinese people is simply to try to divert people's attention and cover up America's own aggression in the Far East.

Everyone knows that it is precisely the United States that is using force and other means to carry out aggression in the Far East. The United States occupies China's territory of Taiwan and uses it as a base for subversive activities against our country and other Asian countries. The United States occupies South Korea, and even after the Chinese People's Volunteers announced their withdrawal from North Korea in stages, it still refuses to withdraw its troops. The United States occupies Japan's Okinawa Island and turns the whole of Japan into its military base in the Far East. Are these not proof of American aggression in the Far East? The United States interferes in the internal affairs of Asian countries everywhere, expanding its aggressive forces in every possible way. In Indochina, the United States places South Vietnam under its control and constantly interferes in the situation in Laos, obstructing the peaceful reunification of Vietnam and Laos; in Thailand and the Philippines, the United States uses the so-called Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to turn them into objects of its plunder and exploitation; in Indonesia, the United States has even created and supported rebel groups against the Indonesian government and people, and recently even colluded with the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group to use aircraft to bomb Indonesian cities and ports. Are these not proof of American aggression in the Far East? For the sake of aggression, the United States openly moved its "defense line" from its borders to the other side of the Pacific, piecing together aggressive military blocs in the Asian and Pacific regions, and constantly conducting military exercises, atomic explosions, and threats of force, creating opposition, division, and tension everywhere, seriously endangering peace and security in the region. Are these not the true manifestations of American policy in the Far East? This is the most arrogant and vicious colonial aggression policy and war adventure policy. This policy has long been resisted by the Asian people, putting the United States in a very isolated and embarrassing position. Recently, the Indonesian government and people have angrily condemned this American policy, and President Sukarno has warned the United States not to play with fire in Asia. No matter how crazy, frantic, cold, or feverish Robertson becomes, he has no way to cover up these facts.

But Robertson's purpose is not only to cover up these facts, but also to prepare an excuse for new American aggression. Robertson's speech ended with the Indonesian issue, which is by no means accidental. Robertson openly stated that the United States is "deeply disturbed" by "certain developments" in the current situation in Indonesia and demanded that the Indonesian government and people "compromise" with the rebel groups. Then, he said in a threatening tone that the United States is "waiting for the development of the situation."

We Asian people all know this rule: whenever the American imperialists shout loudly and slander others for carrying out "aggression," whenever the American imperialists incessantly announce that they want to "protect" others, everyone must be especially vigilant, because this is often a prelude to American aggression.

    罗伯逊的疯狂和无耻
    本报评论员
    美国助理国务卿罗伯逊5月2日在美国参议院外交委员会上发表了一篇“谈话”。据他自己说，他是要谈谈“美国在远东的政策”。可是，实际上罗伯逊对美国在远东的真正政策，几乎连一句也没有讲，他却力竭声嘶地对所谓“国际共产主义”，特别是对中国人民，进行了最恶毒的攻击和诬蔑。罗伯逊信口雌黄，不知羞耻，居然胡说什么中国人民以武力“威胁”了它的国界沿线的所有国家，甚至“侵略”了中国的领土西藏（！）罗伯逊为了耸人听闻，还用十足的流氓口吻，对中国人民的政府和领袖，大肆谩骂。
    究竟什么东西使罗伯逊这样疯狂？当然，罗伯逊是极端仇视中国人民的。但是，他毕竟也会知道：美帝国主义用几十亿美元装备国民党反动派几百万大军，想要打倒中国人民，结果是一败涂地；后来美帝国主义纠集十几个仆从国家的军事力量，想要从朝鲜侵略中国，结果还是一败涂地。中国人民是打不倒的，那么诬蔑和谩骂又能有什么用呢？罗伯逊是懂得这一点的；他所以要疯狂地对中国人民进行诬蔑和谩骂，不过是企图转移人们的视线，来掩盖美国自己在远东的侵略活动而已。
    谁都知道，使用武力以及其他手段在远东进行侵略的，恰恰就是美国。美国侵占了中国领土台湾，并把它作为对我国和亚洲其他国家进行颠覆活动的基地。美国占领了南朝鲜，而且在中国人民志愿军宣布分批撤出朝鲜北部以后，仍然把它的军队赖在那里不走。美国霸占了日本的冲绳岛，而且把整个日本变为它在远东的军事基地。难道这些还不是美国在远东进行侵略活动的证明吗？美国到处干涉亚洲国家的内政，无孔不入地扩张它的侵略势力。在印度支那，美国把越南南部放在它的控制之下，并且不断地干涉老挝的局势，阻挠越南和老挝的和平统一；在泰国和菲律宾，美国利用所谓东南亚条约组织，把它们变为自己掠夺和剥削的对象；在印度尼西亚，美国竟然制造和支持叛乱集团反对印度尼西亚政府和人民，最近甚至勾结台湾蒋介石集团使用飞机轰炸印度尼西亚的城市和港口。难道这些还不是美国在远东进行侵略活动的证明吗？为了侵略，美国公然把它的“国防线”从它的国界移到太平洋的对岸，在亚洲和太平洋地区拼凑侵略性的军事集团，并且不断地进行军事演习、原子爆炸和武力威胁，到处制造对立，制造分裂，制造紧张局势，严重地危害了这个地区的和平与安全。难道这些不就是美国的远东政策的真正表现吗？这是最狂妄最凶恶的殖民侵略政策和战争冒险政策。这种政策早就遭到了亚洲人民的反抗，而使美国处于十分孤立和狼狈的地位。最近印度尼西亚政府和人民就愤怒地谴责了美国的这种政策，苏加诺总统并且警告美国不要在亚洲玩火。罗伯逊不论怎样发疯发狂发冷发热，他毕竟是没有办法掩盖这些事实的。
    但是，罗伯逊的目的还不仅在于掩盖这些事实，同时他还想为美国进行新的侵略活动准备借口。罗伯逊的这篇谈话，是以印度尼西亚问题作结尾的，这决非偶然。罗伯逊公开表示：美国对目前印度尼西亚局势的“某些发展深深感到不安”，并且要求印度尼西亚政府和人民对叛乱集团实行“妥协”。然后，他就以威胁的口吻说：美国正在“等待局势的发展”。
    我们亚洲人民都知道这样一条规律：每逢美帝国主义者大喊大叫诬蔑别人进行“侵略”的时候，每逢美帝国主义者喋喋不休地宣布它要“保护”别人的时候，大家就要特别提高警惕了，因为这经常就是美国进行侵略活动的前奏。
