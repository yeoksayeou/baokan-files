　　Evaluations Should Not Be One-Sided
    After we published "Which Factory Produces the Most Durable Sneakers?" on April 4th of this year, we received many letters from readers pointing out that this report was incomplete. The following is a summary of letters from Tao Yongyu, a worker at the Tianjin Continental Rubber Factory, and the Rubber Shoe Section of the Tianjin Department Store Purchasing and Supply Station:
    First, the service life of the sneakers from various factories listed in the table is based on the trial wear of products from April of last year, which is almost a year ago. In this year, the development of production and technological improvements have been constantly changing. Especially in the context of the Great Leap Forward, this material has lost its relevance and is not in line with the principles of news reporting.
    Second, this material can only be used as internal reference material for each factory, because the rubber content varies in different regions, and the service life will inevitably be different. For example, Shanghai sneakers have a high rubber content, while Tianjin sneakers have a lower rubber content (Tianjin's application to increase the content was not approved). Therefore, this comparative material does not conform to the actual situation.
    Third, according to the mechanical and physical performance indicators of the 333 brand sneakers produced by the Continental Rubber Factory in February 1958 in the Shanghai dissection test, they have nearly caught up with or exceeded the Shanghai Warrior brand sneakers.

　　评比不能片面
    我们在今年4月4日刊登了“哪个厂生产的球鞋最耐穿？”后，收到了不少读者来信，指出这个报道有不全面的地方。现将天津大陆橡胶厂工人陶永瑜、天津百货采购供应站胶鞋科的来信综合如下：
    第一、表中所列各厂球鞋穿用寿命，是去年4月份产品的试穿情况，距离目前将近一年。在这一年中，生产的发展、技术的改进是千变万化的，尤其在大跃进的形势下，这个材料已失去了现实性，同时和新闻报道的原则不相符。
    第二、这个材料只能做为各厂内部的参考资料，因为各地区含胶量的不同，穿用寿命也必然不同。如上海球鞋含量大，天津球鞋含量小（天津申请提高含量未批准）。因此，这种比较的材料是不符合实际情况的。
    第三、根据1958年2月大陆橡胶厂出品的333牌球鞋在上海解剖试验的机械物理性能指标，已接近赶上或超过了上海回力牌球鞋。
