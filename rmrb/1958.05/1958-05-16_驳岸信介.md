After Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi issued a statement on Sino-Japanese relations on May 9th, people from all walks of life in Japan, progressive parties, civic groups, and trade and industry figures have come forward to investigate the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government. They demand that Kishi Nobusuke change his hostile policy towards China, retract what he said when he undermined the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and promptly provide guarantees for the implementation of the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. A poll by the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK) showed that 82% of people want to expand trade with China, only 3% oppose it, and 15% said they were unclear. However, Kishi Nobusuke and his group continue to adhere to a policy of hostility towards China, continuing to sing the old tune of "not recognizing" the five-star red flag as the Chinese national flag and "not being able to recognize a country that the United Nations has not recognized." At the same time, in order to extricate themselves from the predicament they have created, they are even trying to make a false counter-charge, using the lie of "China interfering in Japanese internal affairs" to provoke the friendly relations that have been established between the Chinese and Japanese people over the past few years. They also attempt to stir up an atmosphere of opposition to New China in Japan in order to divert the attention of the Japanese people. We cannot but sternly refute this malicious trick of Kishi Nobusuke and his group.

Kishi Nobusuke and his group insist that China's criticism of the Japanese government's hostile actions towards China at a time when Japan is facing a general election constitutes "interference in Japanese internal affairs." They also spread an atmosphere as if China deliberately "chose" such a time to achieve so-called "political intentions." This statement is completely untenable and absurd.

Kishi Nobusuke should know that displaying one's national flag is an inalienable right of a country's citizens, and safeguarding the dignity of one's national flag is a sacred duty of a country's citizens. Since the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement on March 5th this year, Kishi Nobusuke has repeatedly stated that our private commercial representative office has no right to display its national flag. On May 2nd, he condoned Japanese thugs in Nagasaki tearing down our national flag. The Chinese people, of course, expressed their due indignation at the blatant act of humiliation of our national flag by the former war criminal Kishi Nobusuke. Since the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government has adopted a hostile and extremely unfriendly attitude towards our country, it is bound to affect Sino-Japanese relations, and the Chinese people, of course, have a responsibility to come out and express their solemn position. These issues clearly belong to the nature of Sino-Japanese relations and have nothing to do with Japan's so-called internal affairs. If one must falsely accuse us of interfering in Japanese internal affairs, then we cannot help but ask: Is it only by allowing the Kishi Nobusuke government to manipulate us that we are not interfering in Japan's internal affairs? Does such logic really exist in the world? If it ever existed, it was the logic of the imperialists. We advise Kishi Nobusuke to put away this old set of imperialist logic! Otherwise, he is bound to run into a brick wall. As for the timing issue, it was precisely chosen by Kishi Nobusuke himself.

As everyone knows, at the beginning of this year, due to the Japanese people's growing dissatisfaction with the Kishi Nobusuke government and the rise of the Japanese economic crisis, the trend for Japan to dissolve the House of Representatives and hold early general elections had become a foregone conclusion. In order to increase his capital for the election and deceive voters, Kishi Nobusuke tried every means to resolve a series of outstanding issues related to Japan before deciding to dissolve the House of Representatives, according to his group's wishful thinking. The issue of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, which the Japanese people urgently demanded to conclude, was one of them. The reason why the Japanese delegation of three groups, led by Masanosuke Ikeda, came to Beijing in February this year to negotiate a trade agreement was, on the one hand, the result of pressure from the Japanese people and progressive parties on Kishi Nobusuke, and on the other hand, it was also due to Kishi Nobusuke's own political plans, and therefore obtained Kishi Nobusuke's tacit consent. At that time, the Chinese people, in the spirit of strengthening Sino-Japanese friendship, although knowing that Kishi Nobusuke had some plans, still warmly received the Japanese delegation of three groups and concluded an agreement with the Japanese side. However, after this agreement was formally signed, Kishi Nobusuke, seeing that the goal had been achieved, used a double-dealing tactic, wanting to reap benefits from Sino-Japanese trade and raise his profile during the election, and also wanting to please the United States in order to obtain US loans, in other words, to fleece the United States. Therefore, Kishi Nobusuke did not hesitate to change his face and brazenly tear up the Fourth Trade Agreement, and condone acts of insulting our national flag. As a result of Kishi Nobusuke playing this double-dealing tactic on the issue of Sino-Japanese trade when the general election came, it caused the Chinese people's stern criticism of the Kishi Nobusuke government during this period. So it is true to a Chinese saying: Kishi Nobusuke lifted a stone only to drop it on his own feet.

On the other hand, Kishi Nobusuke and his group are using various methods to interfere in China's internal affairs. The Kishi Nobusuke government denies that the legitimate government elected by 600 million people is the government representing China. Kishi Nobusuke even ran to Taiwan to publicly express his support for Chiang Kai-shek's subversive activities of "recovering the mainland." At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government also harbors elements of the so-called "Taiwan Independence League" Liao Wenyi group, condoning the "public opinion" that "Taiwan should return to Japan" to spread everywhere, vainly attempting to directly intervene in Taiwan in the future and realize its latent imperialist ambitions. Based on the above facts, it can be clearly seen: Is it "China interfering in Japanese internal affairs" or is the Kishi Nobusuke government interfering in China's internal affairs with ulterior political motives?

Kishi Nobusuke and his group also insist that the Chinese people's stern criticism of the Kishi Nobusuke government is merely a gesture towards Japan during the election, so "after the election ends," China will "change its attitude." This statement is also untenable and absurd.

The Chinese people never conceal their views on the broad masses of the Japanese people and a handful of reactionaries in Japan. Since the Japanese government is essentially the political agent of Japanese monopoly capital, and Japanese monopoly capital has obvious latent imperialist desires and militaristic ambitions, which is the reactionary essence of the Japanese government, we have always treated the Japanese people and the Japanese government separately. The Chinese people have a friendly attitude towards the Japanese people, whether in the past, present, or future. We believe that the Chinese people's criticism of the Japanese government will not harm the friendly relations between the Chinese and Japanese people in the slightest. We cannot but "listen to its words and observe its actions" towards the Japanese government. Our attitude is to reciprocate kindness and treat each other as equals. If the Japanese government adopts a friendly attitude towards us, we will naturally adopt a friendly attitude as well; if the Japanese government adopts a hostile and unfriendly attitude towards us, we will resolutely fight back; if the Japanese government adopts a double-dealing attitude towards us, we will thoroughly expose it. Therefore, the Japanese general election has no connection with our current attitude. Whether our attitude changes mainly depends on whether the current Japanese rulers are willing to change their extremely unfriendly and hostile attitude towards our country. To say that the Chinese people's stern criticism of the Kishi Nobusuke government is a gesture during the election is, of course, for the sake of votes. This is not only a deception of the Japanese people, but also a malicious slander of the Chinese people.

Therefore, we must solemnly tell the Kishi Nobusuke government and its agents that what kind of government is elected is, of course, a matter for the Japanese people to decide, but no matter who comes to power after the Japanese general election, no matter who governs and organizes the government, whether Kishi Nobusuke comes to power again, or someone similar to Kishi Nobusuke comes to power, as long as the Japanese government continues to adopt a hostile attitude towards China and an extremely unfriendly attitude towards China, hoping that China will "change its attitude" is wishful thinking. The Chinese people's position is firm, and the Chinese people's attitude is resolute.

As one of the arguments for China's future "change of attitude," some Japanese people also spread a theory that China needs Japanese steel, so Sino-Japanese trade will still recover. There may be two types of people who say this. One type is the one mentioned above who tries to spread a fantasy, deceive the people, and win votes. We don't want to say anything more to these people. In the past, they were full of imperialist ideas, and now they are still full of imperialist ideas. They are unwilling and dare not face up to the rapid development and ever-changing changes of New China. The Chinese people are engaged in construction with unparalleled heroic spirit. We will catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in the main industrial products in about fifteen years, and catching up with and surpassing Japan is even easier. This is by no means empty talk. This year, China only purchased more than 30,000 tons of steel from Japan, and this year China's own steel production will reach more than 7 million tons. Thinking that China must rely on Japanese steel and must do business with Japan according to Kishi Nobusuke's ideas is a complete fantasy. In the end, they will find that they have been deceived by their own fantasies.

However, there are also some people who are truly worried about the future of Sino-Japanese trade and are concerned that Sino-Japanese trade will be completely destroyed by Kishi Nobusuke. To these kind-hearted friends, we would like to say: We never reject trade exchanges and economic exchanges between the peoples of the two countries. Moreover, we do not deny that developing trade between China and Japan is beneficial to both countries. However, the development of trade between China and Japan must be based on the principles of equality, mutual benefit, and promotion of friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The obstacles currently encountered in Sino-Japanese trade are caused by the Kishi Nobusuke government's appeasement of the United States, pleasing the Chiang Kai-shek group, undermining agreements, and condoning incidents of insulting our national flag. If these obstacles are removed, Sino-Japanese trade can naturally develop on a normal track and have a bright future. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government has not yet shown any intention of removing these obstacles. Therefore, we cannot but see that restoring Sino-Japanese trade must overcome many difficulties, and these difficulties are difficult to eliminate if the Kishi Nobusuke government does not change its policy and attitude of hostility towards China.

　　驳岸信介
    在我国陈毅副总理兼外长5月9日就中日关系发表谈话以后，日本各阶层人民、进步党派、民间团体和贸易产业界人士，都出来追究岸信介政府的责任，要求岸信介改变敌视中国的政策，要求岸信介政府收回其破坏中日第四次贸易协定时所说过的话，迅速提出实施中日贸易协定的保证。日本广播协会的舆论调查表明，有82％的人要求同中国扩大贸易，只有3％反对，而15％表示还不清楚。但是岸信介及其集团，却继续坚持敌视中国的政策，继续弹唱“不承认”五星红旗是中国国旗，“不能承认一个联合国所没有承认的国家”之类的滥调。同时，为了摆脱他们自己给自己造成的困境，他们竟妄想倒打一耙，用“中国干涉日本内政”的谎言，来挑拨几年来中日人民所建立起来的友好关系，并企图在日本煽起反对新中国的空气，以转移日本人民的视线。对于岸信介及其集团的这种恶毒伎俩，我们不能不严加驳斥。
    岸信介及其集团硬说在日本面临大选的时候，中国对日本政府敌视中国的行动提出指责，就是“干涉日本内政”，而且还散布一种空气，好像中国故意“选择”了这样一个时机，来达到所谓“政治意图”。这种说法是完全站不住脚的，荒谬的。
    岸信介应该知道，悬挂本国国旗，是一国的公民不可剥夺的权利；维护本国国旗的尊严，更是一国的公民的神圣职责。今年3月5日第四次中日贸易协定签订以来，岸信介口口声声地不承认我国民间商务代表机构有权悬挂本国国旗，到5月2日又纵容日本暴徒在长崎扯下我国国旗，中国人民对前战犯岸信介的明目张胆的污辱我国国旗的行为，当然表示应有的义愤。日本岸信介政府既然对我国采取敌视的，极端不友好的态度，就必然影响到中日关系，中国人民就当然有责任出来表示严正的立场。这些问题显然属于中日关系的性质，和日本的所谓内政问题风马牛不相及。如果一定要胡说我国干涉日本内政的话，那么我们不禁要问：难道中国人民只有听任岸信介政府的摆布，才算是不干涉日本的内政？世界上果真有这样的逻辑吗？如果曾经有过的话，那就是帝国主义分子的逻辑。我们劝告岸信介收起这套陈旧的帝国主义的逻辑吧！不然是一定要碰壁的。至于时机问题，那么这恰恰是岸信介自己一手选择的。
    大家都知道，今年年初，由于日本人民的日益不满岸信介政府和日本经济危机的抬头，日本解散众议院、提前举行大选的趋势已成定局。岸信介为了增加竞选的资本，骗取选票，曾千方百计地企图在决定解散众议院之前，按照他的集团的如意算盘，解决当时和日本有关的一连串悬案。关于日本人民迫切要求缔结的第四次中日贸易协定问题就是其中之一。以池田政之辅为首的日本三团体代表团，所以在今年2月来到北京谈判贸易协定，一方面固然是日本人民和进步党派向岸信介施加压力的结果，同时也是由于岸信介本身有着政治上的打算，因而取得了岸信介的默许。当时中国人民本着加强中日友好的精神，虽然明知岸信介有所打算，但还是热诚地接待了日本三团体代表团，并和日方缔结了协定。但是当这一协定正式签字以后，岸信介看到目的已达，就施展两面三刀的手法，既想在中日贸易中捞取实惠和抬高竞选时的身价，又想讨好美国，以便取得美国的贷款，换句话说就是敲美国的竹杠。因此岸信介就不惜摇身一变，悍然撕毁第四次贸易协定，并纵容污辱我国国旗的行为。岸信介当大选来临时，在中日贸易问题上玩弄这种两面三刀的手法的结果，引起了这一时期来我国人民对岸信介政府的严正指责。所以真应了中国的一句俗话：岸信介才是搬起石头打了自己的脚。
    另一方面，岸信介及其集团，却用各种办法在干涉中国的内政。岸信介政府否认由六亿人民选举出来的合法政府，是代表中国的政府。岸信介甚至跑到台湾去，公开发表支持蒋介石“收复大陆”的颠覆活动性质的谈话。同时，岸信介政府还窝藏所谓“台湾独立同盟”的廖文毅集团分子，纵容“台湾应复归日本”的“舆论”到处散布，妄图将来直接染指台湾，实现它的潜在的帝国主义野心。根据以上事实可以清楚地看出，究竟是“中国干涉日本内政”还是岸信介政府怀着不可告人的政治意图在干涉中国的内政？
    岸信介及其集团又硬说中国人民对岸信介政府的严正指责，仅仅是大选时对日本的一种姿态，因此“大选结束以后”，中国将会“改变态度”的。这种说法同样是站不住脚的，也是荒谬的。
    对于日本广大人民和日本的一小撮反动派，中国人民从不掩盖自己的观点。由于日本政府实质上是日本垄断资本的政治代理人，而日本垄断资本具有明显的潜在的帝国主义的欲望，和军国主义的野心，这是日本政府所具有的反动本质，因此我们对于日本人民和日本政府，从来是分别对待的。中国人民对于日本人民抱着友好的态度，不论过去、现在和将来都是如此。我们相信中国人民对日本政府的指责，丝毫不会损害中国人民和日本人民间的友好关系。对于日本的政府我们不能不“听其言而观其行”。我们的态度是投桃报李，平等对待。如果日本政府对我们采取友好的态度，我们自然也采取友好的态度；日本政府对我们采取敌视的不友好的态度，我们就要坚决反击；日本政府对我们采取两面三刀的态度，我们就要彻底予以揭露。因此，日本大选和我们目前的态度，是没有任何关联。我们的态度是否改变，主要决定于目前日本执政者对我国的极端不友好、敌视我国的态度是否愿意改变。把中国人民对岸信介政府的严正指责，说成是大选期间的一种姿态，其目的固然是为了选票，这不但是对日本人民的一种欺骗，而且显然是对中国人民的恶意诬蔑。
    因此，我们必须正告岸信介政府及其代理人们，选举什么政府，当然是日本人民自己抉择的事，但是不管在日本大选之后，什么人上台，不管什么人执政组织政府，岸信介重新上台也罢，或者类似岸信介的人上台也罢，只要日本政府继续采取敌视中国和对中国极端不友好的态度，指望中国“改变态度”，那是妄想。中国人民的立场是坚定的，中国人民的态度是斩钉截铁的。
    作为对中国将来会“改变态度”的论据之一，某些日本人还散布一种论调，说中国需要日本钢铁，因此中日贸易还是会恢复的。说这种话的，可能有两种人。一种人就是上面说的企图散布一种幻想、欺骗人民、捞取选票的。对于这种人，我们不想再多讲什么。他们过去是满脑子帝国主义想法，现在依然是满脑子帝国主义想法。他们不愿意也不敢正视新中国的飞跃发展和日新月异的变化。中国人民正在以无比豪迈的气概从事建设，我们将在十五年左右的时间，在主要工业产品上赶上并超过英国，赶上和超过日本就更不在话下了。这绝不是一句空话。今年中国只从日本购进了三万多吨钢材，而今年中国自己的钢铁产量将达到七百多万吨。以为中国非依靠日本的钢铁，非按照岸信介的主意同日本作生意不可的，这是一个十足的幻想，到头来他们会发现他们受了自己的幻想的欺骗。
    但是也有一些人是真正忧虑中日贸易的前途，耽心中日贸易会被岸信介彻底破坏的。对于这些好心肠的朋友们，我们想说：两国人民间的贸易往来，经济交流，我们从不拒绝。而且我们也不讳言，发展中日两国的贸易，对两国都是有利的。但是发展中日两国间的贸易必须建立在平等互利和促进两国人民友好的原则上。目前中日贸易碰到的障碍，是由于岸信介政府取媚美国、讨好蒋介石集团、破坏协定、纵容侮辱我国国旗事件所造成的。这些障碍如果除掉，中日贸易自然可以在正常的轨道上发展，而且有着远大的前途。但是，岸信介政府目前还没有丝毫想要除掉这些障碍的表示。因此，我们不能不看到：恢复中日贸易，还必须克服重重困难，而岸信介政府不改变敌视中国的政策和态度，这些困难是很难排除的。
