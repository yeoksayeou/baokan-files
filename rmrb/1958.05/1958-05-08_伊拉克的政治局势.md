    The Political Situation in Iraq
    By Sairan Adier, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party

    Tied to the Imperialist Chariot

    At a time when the struggle between American, British, and French imperialism and the Arab peoples striving for freedom and national unity is intensifying, the situation in Iraq is of particular importance.

    Iraq is an Arab country. The majority of the Iraqi people share common modern national characteristics with the peoples of other Arab countries, which are now developing faster than ever and are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people. All Arab nations are fighting for freedom and democracy, for future unity and a better life.

    Although Iraq is a small country, it is rich in resources, one of the world's major oil-producing regions, rich in sulfur and other minerals, with fertile land, convenient irrigation, and a strategically important location on international transportation lines.

    However, these resources have not been used to improve the lives of the Iraqi and other Arab peoples, but have been divided up by imperialist monopolies, their feudal agents, and some traitors, and used to suppress the people and maintain their exploitation. Our country has been used as a base for provocative activities against the Arab national liberation movement.

    Monopoly companies extract 35 million tons of oil from Iraq annually, worth 180 million pounds. Sulfur reserves, which account for about one-sixth of the world's reserves, have been suspended due to conflicts between the United States and Britain. Agricultural products such as dates and grains are under the control of monopoly companies. Monopoly capital occupies all economic sectors. British newspapers pointed out that 75% of Iraq's oil revenue is returned to the British through these companies. The Iraqi market is full of foreign luxury goods. For example, imports in 1955 totaled 97 million pounds, and goods imported from Britain and the United States alone accounted for half. Imperialism controls Iraq's currency and foreign trade. Due to Iraq's connection with the Sterling Area, half of the British imperialist economic crisis is borne by the Iraqi people. For example, in 1949, due to the devaluation of the pound, the value of the Iraqi dinar (Iraqi pound) also fell by one-third, and Iraq had as much as 160 million pounds in savings, from which Britain benefited greatly.

    Iraq's oil revenue is used for various purposes against the people. The Iraqi Development Board receives 70% of the oil revenue annually, all of which is used for the construction of airports, seaplane bases, strategic mountain highways, barracks, etc., to meet the needs of imperialism in preparing for a world war. A large part of the oil revenue is used to strengthen the institutions that suppress the people. For example, 40% of the Iraqi government's budget for 1957 (more than 21 million pounds) was used for the army and police, only 2% for social undertakings, only 8.5% for education, only 7.5% for health, and only 0.7% for economic construction. Last year, the Iraqi government spent 5 million pounds on subversive activities against the Syrian government, which have been exposed by the Syrian people. The Iraqi government has also designated a large budget for promoting the Baghdad Pact and buying off some journalists and politicians in other Arab countries who betray their motherland. The government has created a huge bureaucratic apparatus that is divorced from the people and has established this apparatus on a foundation composed of monopoly capitalists, usurers, contractors closely related to national construction undertakings, and figures who take advantage of the current situation to make fortunes.

    In rural areas, the imperialists have always rewarded the feudal system for many years, concentrating a large amount of arable land in the hands of a few big landlords, and using various laws and methods to protect their rights. The total arable land in Iraq is only 45 million musharas (note: each mushara is approximately equal to four mu in China), while one hundred and four big landlords each occupy between 20,000 and 1 million musharas of arable land.

    In order to maintain the current situation, protect their greedy interests, and implement their plans for aggression against Arab countries and undermining world peace, the imperialists and their agents use various unequal agreements and treaties to restrain Iraq. Currently, Iraq is bound by the infamous Baghdad Pact, and its foreign policy, economic policy, military and public security forces management, intelligence, and propaganda are all controlled by the various committees and experts of this treaty. The Iraqi government agreed to the Eisenhower Doctrine announced a year ago, which aims to hinder cooperation between Arab countries and the socialist camp and to allow American forces to replace the crumbling British and French imperialist forces, thereby making the Arab nations forever subject to imperialist oppression, while also attacking the independence of Syria and Egypt. Iraq signed a special agreement with the United States and another agreement with Britain in April 1955, according to which Iraq gave Britain the right to use military bases and Iraqi airports, placed all of Iraq's troops under the control of more than 400 British military experts, and gave Britain various privileges in Iraq's most important enterprises and undertakings related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Iraq also signed oil agreements with monopoly companies invested in by Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, allowing those monopoly companies not only to extract our country's oil and the blood and sweat of our workers, but also to set up their own spy networks throughout the country and interfere in our country's most important internal affairs. Iraq is bound by the Sterling Area agreement, as mentioned earlier. In addition, Iraq is also bound by the US Mutual Security Agreement and the Fourth Point Program.

    It can be seen from this that Iraq is a pillar of the world imperialist bloc. Britain has the most interests and the greatest influence in Iraq.

    The People Live in Deep Waters

    Undoubtedly, due to the strengthening of dependence on imperialism, Iraq has lost the possibility of implementing an independent policy. This independent policy is consistent with the sovereignty of the people and the interests of the liberated Arab people, and has a profound impact on the lives of the people.

    Farmers in Iraq account for two-thirds of the country's population, but they suffer from the most primitive exploitation and live in extreme poverty. The average income of an Iraqi peasant family is less than twenty dinars (Iraqi pounds) per year. As a result, the number of farmers flowing into the cities is increasing day by day, which on the one hand weakens agricultural production, and on the other hand, makes the working class in the cities face a greater threat of wage cuts and unemployment. Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations said in a report on Iraq: "Modern people cannot accept such a situation, a nation starving in agricultural 'prosperity' and deceptive appearances, which makes the conscience of the world uneasy."

    In the cities, the working class, with a population of 1.25 million, lives a hard and difficult life due to the gradual decline in wages and the gradual increase in rents and prices of daily necessities. According to official statistics, the average annual income of working families living in simple houses in Baghdad is 146.2 dinars, and the average annual income of working families living in ordinary houses is 237.1 dinars. According to the same statistics, the average annual wage of Iraqi workers is only 64 dinars. According to the report of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development's Iraq inspection team, the general price level in Iraq has risen by 660% compared to 1939, while workers' wages have only increased by 100% compared to 1939.

    This is the living situation of the working class and the peasant masses. People of other classes also suffer from varying degrees of hardship, which is caused by the rule of monopoly companies and foreign banks and the policy of following imperialism. The growth and prosperity of national industries are stubbornly hindered, and emerging industries are subjected to various kinds of devastation. Capitalists have no choice but to use their funds to buy fields, or contract government construction projects, or deposit them in banks and let them freeze.

    In order to impose this situation on the people, the ruling class and their imperialist masters have deprived the people of all kinds of rights and adopted the most barbarous means of suppression against the people. All political parties, trade unions, newspapers, and associations, whether nationalist or anti-government, have been forced to disband or suspend publication. The ruling class is also accustomed to raping public opinion and setting up parliaments, the vast majority of whose members are the most loyal agents of imperialism or people who dare not oppose imperialism's various plans and conspiracies. The national movement, especially the Communist Party, has suffered all kinds of persecution, including being massacred, exiled, and sentenced to various prison terms. In 1949, after the members of the Communist Party's political bureau were hanged, their bodies were hung in many squares in Baghdad to be displayed to the public. In 1956, two committee members of the Communist Party's local committee in Haiyi City were hanged. In 1953, there was a massacre of communist political prisoners, and more than 20 fighters among the Communist Party members died heroically. During the periods of 1934, 1935, and 1945, several peasant uprisings occurred in southern, northern, and central Iraq, all of which were brutally suppressed. Several nationalist uprisings, especially those in 1948, 1952, and 1956, were all suppressed by force. In these uprisings, several hundred nationalist fighters—Communist Party members and non-party members—sacrificed themselves. Especially since 1946, Iraqi prisons have been filled with thousands of male and female fighters, who have been imprisoned for fighting for the independence and freedom of their motherland. Currently, there are still more than 500 fighters in Iraqi prisons, sentenced to various prison terms, many of whom have been sentenced to life imprisonment. Iraqi law explicitly stipulates that Communist Party members can be sentenced to death or exile, and even those engaged in the peace movement and the people's democratic movement can be sentenced to the same penalties.

    Since 1952, the government's oil tax revenue has increased several times. The large amount of revenue has enabled the government to adopt a policy of buying off certain social dregs, who have become rich by relying on this illegal income. The government has also been able to use these people with mercenary views and speculative tricks to create a huge bureaucratic apparatus, and has been able to conduct deceptive propaganda to make all bourgeois elements feel that their property and profits are linked to the imperialist rule and inseparable. But we can easily recognize the essence of this problem, except for imperialism and its monopoly companies, and those agents who rely on the power of imperialism to plunder the country's rich resources and wealth, this situation is unfavorable to anyone. Changing this situation, guaranteeing the country's independence, and enabling the country to closely cooperate with the Arab liberation movement, we will be able to develop our country's resources and economy in a better way, so that people of all classes, including the bourgeoisie, can benefit.

    The Glorious Tradition of Revolutionary Struggle

    But this situation has not prevented the Iraqi people, including the Arab people and the Kurdish people, from carrying out revolutionary struggles to defend peace and fight for freedom and democracy. Since ancient times, our Iraqi people have made many significant contributions to human civilization and progress, and have also produced many revolutionaries, philosophers, and free thinkers. Our nation has a glorious revolutionary tradition of defending national freedom and national dignity. For thousands of years, all aggressors who attempted to enslave the Iraqi people have been burned by the flames of resistance of the Iraqi people. Even in modern times, the Iraqi people remain loyal to their revolutionary traditions, and they have waged glorious struggles against imperialism and its agents, for national independence and national unity. Although these struggles have caused them great sacrifices, their strong will has never been frustrated.

    Before World War I, our people repeatedly held revolutions against Turkish rule. In 1917, they rose up against the British occupation. In 1920, they held a great revolution to demand freedom and independence. In 1930, they opposed the humiliating Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. In 1948, they opposed the signing of a new Anglo-Iraqi treaty and prevented the conclusion of the Portsmouth Treaty, and overthrew the government that concluded the treaty. In 1952, the Iraqi people held demonstrations to oppose participation in the "Middle East Command."

    With the joint invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel and the threats and conspiracies of imperialism against Syria, the nationalism of the Iraqi people rose. The imperialists hoped to use the Baghdad Pact to isolate Iraq from the rest of the Arab nations, but their hopes have been dashed. At that time, the Iraqi people held bloody strikes, class boycotts, market boycotts, and demonstrations in more than 30 cities, and declared their firm will to stand with Egypt and Syria. At the same time, Iraqi workers blew up oil pipelines to prevent the imperialists from using this to put pressure on Syria. This action forced the ruling class to express support for Egypt and to stop its activities of hostility towards the liberated Arab countries.

    In these glorious struggles, the Iraqi national movement and the Communist Party played a more active role, made more sacrifices, and gained many experiences. First of all, various national forces unanimously recognized the necessity of carrying out a unified struggle in a united front. Since 1944, the Communist Party has continuously emphasized the necessity of united front work. At the end of 1956, this broad and clear cooperation was established for the first time among the various national parties in Iraq. Almost all national parties participated in the united front, and some non-party democrats also participated in the united front. The united front announced clear goals of struggle, which were to withdraw Iraq from the Baghdad Pact, condemn the Eisenhower Doctrine, unite with the Arab national movement, adopt an independent foreign policy that is not influenced by imperialism and is based on defending peace and friendly exchanges between countries, realize democratic freedom, release all political prisoners, defend national resources, and develop the national economy.

    In addition, the National United Front also participated in Arab national activities, strengthened its ties with the Arab national liberation movement, and expressed mutual support for national unity among Arab countries. The basis of this national unity is to seek liberation from the rule of imperialism and its agents, and to guarantee the democratic rights of the people.

    The Kurdish people account for one-sixth of Iraq's total population. The Communist Party believes that after Iraq gets rid of the Baghdad Pact and other imperialist ties, Iraq should form a federation with the United Arab Republic, and the regional autonomy rights of the Kurdish people in the federation must be guaranteed. This will pave the way for the realization of the national unity of the Kurdish people in Iraq, Turkey, and Iran. Because, according to the principle of national self-determination, they have the right to secede from Iraq and organize independent, national political institutions. This is the national policy of the Iraqi Communist Party, and other national forces also support this national policy. Undoubtedly, only by guaranteeing the regional autonomy rights of the Kurdish people can we mobilize the Kurdish people to participate in the common struggle against the Baghdad Pact, for the liberation of the motherland, and in coordination with the Arab national liberation movement.

    Our Communist Party is constantly, bravely, and selflessly fighting against imperialism and reactionary rulers. Our party has a strict organization. Our members are all over the country, including Iraqi Kurdistan. In the work of establishing a national united front, and in putting forward slogans for unified action in the current stage experienced by the country, our party is shouldering the primary task.

                                      (To be continued)

    伊拉克的政治局势
    伊拉克共产党中央委员会书记　赛兰·阿迭勒
    绑在帝国主义的战车上
    当此美、英、法帝国主义与为争取自由和民族团结而斗争的阿拉伯各民族之间的斗争日趋剧烈的时候，伊拉克的局势具有特别的重要性。
    伊拉克是一个阿拉伯国家。伊拉克的大部分人民与阿拉伯各国人民之间有着共同的现代民族的标志，这些标志现在比任何时代发展得更快，而且日益深入人心。所有的阿拉伯民族都在为争取自由民主而奋斗，为争取将来的统一和更好的生活而奋斗。
    伊拉克虽然是一个小国，但是资源丰富，是世界上盛产石油的地区之一，而且富于硫磺和其他矿物，土地肥沃，灌溉便利，位于国际交通线上，形势险要。
    但是，这些资源并未用来改善伊拉克和其它阿拉伯国家人民群众的生活，却是被帝国主义垄断企业及其封建代理人和一些卖国贼所瓜分，用去镇压人民，维持对人民的剥削。我们的国家被用作对阿拉伯民族解放运动进行挑衅活动的基地。
    垄断公司每年从伊拉克开采石油三千五百万吨，价值一万八千万英镑。蕴藏量约占全世界蕴藏量六分之一的硫磺，由于美、英两国之间的矛盾而停止开采。椰枣、粮食等农产品都在垄断公司的控制之下。垄断资本占据了各个经济部门。英国报纸指出，伊拉克所得的石油税，有75％，通过这些公司重新回到英国人的手中。伊拉克市场充满了外国的奢侈品，例如1955年的输入共计九千七百万镑，仅从英美两国输入的货物就占一半。帝国主义控制着伊拉克的货币和对外贸易。由于伊拉克与英镑集团的联系，英帝国主义的经济危机有一半由伊拉克人民来负担，例如1949年，由于英镑贬值，伊拉克的第纳尔（伊拉克镑）的价值也下降了三分之一，伊拉克的存账达一亿六千万英镑之多，英国在这方面得到很大的好处。
    伊拉克所得的石油税被用于反对人民的各种目的。伊拉克建设委员会每年分得石油税70％，全部用于建设飞机场、水上飞机场、山地战略公路、营房等，以满足帝国主义准备世界战争的需要。石油税中有大部分是用于加强镇压人民的机构的。例如1957年度伊拉克政府预算的40％（在二千一百万镑以上）用于军队和警察，用于社会事业的仅占2％，用于教育事业的仅占8.5％，用于卫生事业的仅占7.5％，用于经济建设的仅占0.7％。去年，伊拉克政府用五百万镑去颠覆叙利亚政府的阴谋活动，叙利亚人民已揭露了这种阴谋。伊拉克政府又指定很大的一笔预算，用于宣传巴格达条约，和收买其他阿拉伯国家中某些出卖祖国的记者和政客。政府制造了一个庞大的、脱离人民的官僚机构，并把这个机构建立在一个由垄断资本家、高利贷者、和国家建设事业有密切关系的承包商人以及利用现在的局势来发财致富的人物所组成的基础上。
    在农村里，帝国主义者多年来一向奖励封建制度，使大量的耕地集中在少数大地主的手中，而且用各式各样的法律和方法去保护他们的权利。伊拉克全国的耕地面积不过四千五百万木沙赖（按：每木沙赖约等于中国的四亩），而一百零四个大地主，每人就占有耕地二万到一百万木沙赖。
    帝国主义者和他们的代理人，为了维持现在的局势，以便保护他们贪婪的利益和实施他们对阿拉伯各国的侵略计划和破坏世界和平，他们用种种不平等的协定和条约来把伊拉克约束起来。现在，伊拉克受到臭名远扬的巴格达条约的约束，外交政策、经济政策、军队和公安部队的管理、情报和宣传等都归这个条约的各委员会和专家们掌握。伊拉克政府同意了一年以前宣布的艾森豪威尔主义，这个主义的目的是阻碍阿拉伯各国与社会主义阵营的合作，并且使美国的势力取代摇摇欲坠的英法帝国主义势力，从而使阿拉伯民族永远受帝国主义的压迫，同时打击叙利亚和埃及的独立。伊拉克跟美国签订了一项特别协定，又于1955年4月和英国签订了一个协定，根据这个协定，伊拉克把使用军事基地和伊拉克飞机场的权利让给英国，把伊拉克的全部军队放在四百多个英国军事专家的掌握中，并使英国在伊拉克最重要的企业和关乎国计民生的事业中享受种种特权。伊拉克又跟英、美、法、荷四国投资的垄断公司签订了石油协定，使那些垄断公司不仅能够榨取我国的石油和工人的血汗，而且在全国各地布置了自己的特务网，对我国最重要的内政进行干涉。伊拉克受金镑区协定的约束，前面已经说过了。此外，伊拉克还受美国互保安全协定和第四点计划的约束。
    由此可见，伊拉克是世界帝国主义集团的一个支柱。英国在伊拉克的利益最多，势力也最大。
    人民生活在水深火热中
    无疑的，由于加强对于帝国主义的依附，伊拉克便丧失了执行独立政策的可能。这种独立政策是与人民的主权一致的，也是与解放了的阿拉伯人民的利益相符合的，对于人民的生活也有深远的影响。
    伊拉克的农民占全国人口的三分之二，他们却遭受着最原始的剥削，生活极端贫困。伊拉克农民家庭的平均收入，每年不到二十个第纳尔（伊拉克镑），因此，流入城市的农民与日俱增，这就一方面削弱了农业生产，另一方面又使城市里的工人阶级遭到更大的削减工资和失业的威胁。联合国粮食及农业组织的专家们在一份关于伊拉克的报告书中说：“现代的人类不可能接受这样的局势，一个民族在农业‘繁荣’和骗人的表象中忍饥挨饿，这是世界的良心感到不安的。”
    在城市里呢，由于工资逐渐下降，房租和日用必需品的物价逐渐上涨，人口达一百二十五万的工人阶级过着艰难困苦的生活。根据官方统计，在巴格达居住简陋房子的工人家庭，每年的平均收入是一百四十六点二第纳尔，居住普通房子的工人家庭，每年的平均工资是二百三十七点一第纳尔。根据同一份统计资料，伊拉克工人每年的平均工资不过六十四第纳尔。根据国际复兴银行伊拉克考察团的报告，伊拉克的一般物价，比1939年上涨了660％，工人的工资比1939年却只上升了一百。
    这是工人阶级和农民群众的生活情况，其他各阶层的人民也遭受着不同程度的艰难困苦，那是由于垄断公司和外国银行的统治和追随帝国主义的政策造成的。民族工业的成长和繁荣受到顽强的阻碍，新兴的工业遭到各式各样的摧残，资本家们只好用自己的资金去买田产，或承包政府的工程建设或者存入银行，让它冻结起来。
    统治阶级和他们的帝国主义主子们，为了把这种局势强加于人民，他们剥夺了人民的各种权利，对人民采取了最野蛮的镇压手段。一切政党、工会、报刊、社团，凡是民族主义的和反对政府的，都被迫解散或停刊了。统治阶级又惯于强奸民意，设立议会，绝大多数的议员是最效忠于帝国主义的代理人或者是不敢反对帝国主义的各种计划和阴谋的人。民族运动，特别是共产党，遭到了种种迫害，有被屠杀的，有被放逐的，有被判处各种徒刑的。1949年，共产党政治局委员们被处绞刑后，他们的尸体被悬挂在巴格达的许多广场里示众。1956年海义城共产党地委会的两个委员同志被处绞刑。1953年对共产党的政治犯进行屠杀，共产党员中的二十多名斗士壮烈牺牲了。在1934、1935、1945年期间，在伊拉克南部、北部和中部发生过几次农民起义，都被残酷镇压下去了。有几次民族主义的起义，特别是1948、1952、1956年的起义，都是用武力镇压下去的，在这些起义中，有好几百个民族主义的斗士——共产党员和党外人士——都牺牲了。特别是从1946年以来，伊拉克的监狱里挤满了成千上万的男女斗士，他们都是为争取祖国的独立和自由而被关入监狱的。现在，伊拉克监狱里还有五百多名斗士，被判处各种徒刑，其中有很多人是被判处无期徒刑的。伊拉克的法律以明文规定，对共产党员可以判处死刑或流放，甚至连从事和平运动和人民民主运动者也可以判处同样的刑罚。
    自1952年以来，政府所得的石油税收入增加了好几倍，大量的收入使政府能够对某些社会渣滓采取一种收买政策，而这些人就靠着这种非法的收入发财致富。政府也就能够利用这些具有雇佣观点和投机取巧的人制造一个庞大的官僚主义机构，而且能够进行欺骗宣传，使所有资产阶级都感觉到他们的财产和利润是与帝国主义统治的局面互相联系，不可分离的。但是我们很容易认识这个问题的实质，除了帝国主义及其垄断公司，和靠着帝国主义的势力来掠夺国家的丰富资源和财富的那些代理人以外，这种局面对任何人都是不利的。改变这种局面，使国家的独立获得保证，使国家能与阿拉伯解放运动密切合作，我们才有可能依照更好的方式开发我国的资源，发展我国的经济，使各阶级的人民，包括资产阶级在内，都得到好处。
    革命斗争的光荣传统
    但是这种局面并没有妨碍伊拉克人民，包括阿拉伯人民和库尔德人民为保卫和平、争取自由和民主而进行的革命斗争。我们伊拉克人民自古以来，对于人类的文明和进步曾作出许多重大的贡献，也产生了许多革命家、哲学家和自由思想家。我国民族具有保卫民族自由和民族尊严的、光荣的革命传统。千百年来，企图奴役伊拉克人民的一切侵略者都被伊拉克人民反抗的烈火所焚毁。就在现代，伊拉克人民仍然忠于自己的革命传统，他们为了反对帝国主义及其代理人，为了争取民族独立和民族团结而进行了光荣的斗争，这种斗争虽然使他们遭到很大的牺牲，但是他们坚强的意志从来没有受到挫折。
    在第一次世界大战前，我国人民屡次举行革命，反对土耳其人的统治。1917年，又起来反抗英军的占领。1920年又为要求自由和独立而举行大革命。1930年反对丧权辱国的英伊条约。1948年反对签订新的英伊条约，并且阻止缔结朴茨茅斯条约，而且打倒了缔结这个条约的政府。1952年伊拉克人民为反对参加“中东司令部”而举行示威游行。
    随着英、法、以三国对埃及进行联合侵略和帝国主义对叙利亚进行威胁和阴谋活动，伊拉克人民的民族主义高涨起来了。帝国主义者希望用巴格达条约来使伊拉克与其余的阿拉伯民族隔绝开来，他们的希望已经落空了。当时伊拉克人民在三十多个城市举行了流血罢工、罢课、罢市和示威游行，并且宣布他们与埃及和叙利亚站在一边的坚决意志，同时，伊拉克工人炸毁了输油管，不让帝国主义者借此来向叙利亚施加压力。这个行动迫使统治阶级表示支持埃及，并制止它仇视解放了的阿拉伯国家的活动。
    在这些光荣的斗争中，伊拉克的民族运动和共产党起了更多的积极作用，并付出更多的牺牲，也取得了许多经验。首先是各种民族力量一致承认在统一战线中进行统一斗争的必要性。自1944年以来，共产党不断强调统战工作的必要性。在1956年底，伊拉克各民族党派之间第一次建立了这种广泛而且明确的合作。几乎所有的民族党派都参加了统一战线，此外还有一些无党派民主人士也参加了统一战线。统一战线宣布了明确的奋斗目标，这就是使伊拉克退出巴格达条约，谴责艾森豪威尔主义，与阿拉伯民族运动团结一致，采取不受帝国主义影响的、以保卫和平和各国友好往来为基础的独立外交政策，实现民主自由，释放一切政治犯，保卫国家资源，发展民族经济。
    此外，民族统一战线还参加了阿拉伯民族活动，加强了与阿拉伯民族解放运动的联系，对于阿拉伯各国之间的民族团结表示互相支持。这种民族团结的基础是从帝国主义及其代理人的统治下求得解放，而且保证人民的民主权利。
    库尔德族人民占伊拉克全国人口的六分之一。共产党认为在摆脱巴格达条约和其它的帝国主义联系之后，伊拉克应该与阿拉伯联合共和国结成联邦，必须保证库尔德族人民在联邦内的区域自治权利，这将为实现伊拉克、土耳其、伊朗三国境内库尔德人民的民族统一铺平道路。因为根据民族自决的原则，他们是有权利脱离伊拉克而组织独立的、民族政治机构的。这是伊拉克共产党的民族政策，其它的民族力量也有支持这种民族政策的。无疑的，只有保证库尔德族人民的区域自治权利，才能发动库尔德族人民参加反对巴格达条约，争取祖国解放，与阿拉伯民族解放运动相配合的共同斗争。
    我们共产党在不断地、英勇地、忘我地对帝国主义和反动统治者进行斗争。我们的党有着严密的组织。我们的党员遍布全国，包括伊拉克的库尔德斯坦。在建立民族统一战线的工作方面，在国家所经历的现阶段中提出统一行动口号方面，我们的党都担负着首要任务。
                                      （未完）
