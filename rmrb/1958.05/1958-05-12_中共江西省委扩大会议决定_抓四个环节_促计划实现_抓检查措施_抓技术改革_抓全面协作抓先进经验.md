　　(Reported by this newspaper) The Enlarged Meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the CPC recently convened a plenary meeting of its members. The central theme of the meeting was to discuss how to strive in every possible way to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward plan and targets. The meeting first reviewed the situation of the Great Leap Forward in the province from last winter to this spring, and believed that the general situation was: high enthusiasm, many methods, high targets, and great achievements. In agriculture, the water conservancy projects being completed in the province can increase and improve the irrigated area by 14.15 million mu, exceeding the original plan by 237%; the accumulated fertilizer has reached 10.2 billion dan, exceeding the original plan by 240%; all kinds of spring harvest crops have achieved bumper harvests, especially rapeseed, which has increased by more than 100 million jin compared to last year. Wheat and barley are also expected to have bumper harvests. Afforestation and oil tea cultivation have exceeded the planned targets. In local industry, a high tide of industrial development by the whole people has emerged in the province. The province has raised 300 million yuan for industrial construction, and factory construction is also actively underway, with several thousand enterprises already in production. The meeting believed that all of these are great achievements.

    However, the meeting believed that in order to achieve this year's plan and targets, leaders at all levels should focus on the following key aspects:

    First, grasp the targets and inspect the measures. Through inspecting the measures, any shortcomings should be immediately strengthened and remedial action taken. In agriculture, the focus should be on water and fertilizer measures. Generally, all localities should seize the idle season after early rice transplanting to organize another large-scale fertilizer accumulation and transportation campaign, striving to have 200 dan of raw fertilizer per mu of late rice fields. Industrial construction is currently facing difficulties with technical equipment and cadres. The meeting summarized the experience of the Shangrao Prefectural Committee, believing that their practice of "indigenous mechanization" (masses manufacturing their own equipment) and cultivating "indigenous engineers" to solve the equipment and cadre difficulties is feasible, and all localities should follow this spirit to mobilize the masses to solve this difficulty.

    Second, grasp technical reform. In order to ensure continuous leaps forward in production, technical reform, especially the reform of agricultural tools and transportation tools, has become a problem that urgently needs to be solved for production development and the broad masses. The current priority is to make a firm resolution, rely on the masses, and boldly grasp it, then gradually improve it and expand it from point to area. Agricultural tool reform and mechanization should be carried out simultaneously. This year, all counties in the province should establish tractor stations and promote various agricultural machines. This two-pronged approach, complementing each other, will rapidly increase labor productivity to meet the requirements of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture.

    Third, strengthen collaboration and mutual support. The meeting required all localities to convene various necessary collaboration meetings within a limited time frame based on the needs of production development, formulate collaboration contracts, and fix the regular collaborative relationship in order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, support each other, and leap forward together.

    Fourth, establish banners and promote advanced experiences. Recently, the masses in various localities have made many creations, and all localities should summarize and promote them in a timely manner. Regular comprehensive mass inspections and appraisal and competition campaigns should be carried out, and the appraisal should spark a wave of learning from and catching up with the advanced, so as to promote the realization of the Great Leap Forward plan. The meeting analyzed the current ideological state of cadres and the masses, believing that in the high tide of the overall Great Leap Forward, the depth and breadth of mass mobilization are better than any previous movement. The vast majority of cadres and the masses have actively joined the movement. However, there are still a few people who are following the crowd, and their confidence in achieving the Great Leap Forward is not strong enough, and their enthusiasm is not sufficient. There are also a few people who have resistance to the Great Leap Forward. Therefore, the meeting pointed out that Party committees at all levels must firmly grasp the principle of putting politics in command and must not neglect political and ideological work for a moment. They must continue to deeply criticize right-leaning conservative thinking, encourage the advanced, criticize the backward, and drive the middle.

    The meeting also conveyed and discussed the recent instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. The meeting implemented the spirit of combining the virtual and the real, emphasized ideological exchanges, and carried out criticism and self-criticism. The meeting was filled with a new atmosphere of daring to think, daring to speak, feeling comfortable, and being lively and vigorous from beginning to end.

　　中共江西省委扩大会议决定
　　抓四个环节　促计划实现
　　抓检查措施  抓技术改革  抓全面协作抓先进经验
    本报讯　中共江西省委最近召开了全体委员扩大会议。会议的中心是讨论千方百计地争取实现今年的大跃进计划和指标。会议首先研究了去冬今春全省大跃进的情况，认为总的情况是：劲头很足，办法很多，指标很高，成绩很大。在农业方面，全省正完成的水利工程可以增加和改善灌溉面积一千四百一十五万亩，超过原计划的237％，所积肥料已达一百零二亿担，超过原计划240％；各种春收作物都获得了丰收，特别是油菜比去年增产一亿斤以上。大小麦也丰收在望。植树造林、垦复油茶都超额完成了计划。地方工业，目前全省已经出现了全民办工业的高潮，全省筹集工业建设资金达三亿元，建厂工作也在积极进行，并且已经有数千多个企业投入了生产。会议认为，所有这些都是伟大的成绩。
    但是，会议认为，要实现今年的计划和指标，各级领导应着重抓住以下几个环节：
    第一、抓指标，检查措施。通过检查措施，发现有不足的地方应立即加强，进行补课。农业方面首先是抓水、肥两大措施，各地一般都应在早稻插秧后抓紧空闲季节，再组织一次大规模的积肥运肥运动，争取做到每亩晚稻田有原肥二百担。工业建设，现在遇到了技术设备和干部的困难，会议总结了上饶地委的经验，认为他们实行“土机械化”（群众自己制造设备），培养“土工程师”来解决设备和干部的困难的办法可行，各地也应根据这种精神，发动群众解决这一困难。
    第二、抓技术改革。为了保证生产不断的跃进，技术改革特别是农具和运输工具的改革，已成为生产发展和广大群众迫切需要解决的问题。当前首先是要下定决心，依靠群众，大胆地抓起来，然后再逐步提高，由点到面地普遍展开。农具改革与机械化同时并举，今年全省各县都设立拖拉机站，推行各种农业机械。这样双管齐下，相辅而行，迅速提高劳动生产率，以适应农业大跃进的要求。
    第三、加强协作，互相支援。会议要求各地根据发展生产的需要，限期召开各种必要的协作会议，制订协作合同，把经常性的协作关系固定下来，以便充分发挥各方面的积极性，互相支援，共同跃进。
    第四、树立旗帜，推广先进经验。最近一个时期各地群众有很多创造，各地要及时总结，加以推广。要定期开展全面的群众性的大检查，和评比竞赛运动，通过评比掀起学先进、赶先进的热潮，以促进大跃进计划的实现。会议分析了目前干部和群众的思想状况，认为在全面大跃进的高潮中，群众发动的深度和广度比已往任何一个运动都要好，绝大多数干部和群众都已经积极投入到运动中来。但是还有少数人是随大流的，他们对实现大跃进的信心还不够强，干劲还不够足；也还有少数人对大跃进有抵触思想。因此会议指出各级党委必须紧紧抓住政治挂帅这一条，决不能有一刻忽视政治思想工作，必须继续深入地批判右倾保守思想，鼓励先进，批判落后，带动中间。
    会议还传达和讨论了最近党中央和毛主席的指示。会议贯彻了虚实并举的精神，强调了思想交锋，开展了批评与自我批评。会议中自始至终洋溢着敢想、敢说、心情舒畅、生动活泼的新气象。
