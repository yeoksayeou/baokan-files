    A New Method of Raising Chicks - Tiered Cage Rearing
    The state-owned Shuangqiao Farm has adopted the method of tiered cage rearing for chicks, and the results are extremely good. The farm started raising chickens in 1950, but the survival rate of chicks was very low every year, and the weight gain was slow, resulting in losing money on chicken farming. This year, encouraged by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the staff learned and boldly experimented with the Soviet advanced method of tiered cage rearing, raising a total of 1,413 chickens, and achieved a 100% survival rate (the general survival rate is 60% - 85%). In forty-five days, the weight has grown to one *jin* [approximately 500 grams]. This demonstrates extremely superior results.
    In tiered cage rearing, in addition to the extremely high survival rate and weight gain, it also demonstrates other advantages in several aspects. For example, the utilization rate of housing equipment has been fully utilized. In the past, an area of 20 square meters could only accommodate 600 chickens, and the density was very high, which was extremely crowded. After cage rearing, it can accommodate 1,800 chickens, and it is very spacious. The supply of feed can be greatly saved. In the past, when feeding chickens, fine feed was scattered on the ground and could not be used. After cage rearing, fine feed is completely restricted in the cage and is not easily scattered. In terms of management, in the past, a female worker could only manage 900 chickens, but now she can manage 1,800 chickens.
    The method of tiered cage rearing is also simple and easy to implement. The method is: use wood (or bricks) to make a cage like a wall cabinet, which is divided into several layers. A long feeding trough is attached to the outside of each layer, and the chicks live in the cages on each layer.

    养小鸡的新方法——分层笼育
    国营双桥农场采取分层笼育的方法育雏鸡，效果极为良好。该场自1950年就开始养鸡，但每年雏鸡的成活率很低，增重慢，结果养鸡赔钱。今年在大跃进形势的鼓舞下，职工们学习和大胆的试验了苏联先进的分层笼育方法，共养鸡一千四百一十三只，结果达到了百分之百的成活率（一般成活率是60％——85％），在四十五天中，体重已长到一市斤。显示了极其优越的成效。
    在分层笼育中，除了有极高的成活率和增重外，还显示了其他若干方面的优越性。如在房屋设备利用率上，得到充分的发挥，过去二十平方公尺的面积，只能容养六百只，并且密度很大，极为拥挤；笼育后，可容一千八百只，且很宽裕。在饲料的供给上可大大节约，过去喂鸡时，精料被撒漏地上不能利用，笼育后精料即完全被限制在笼内不易撒漏。在管理上过去一个女工只能管到九百只，现在可管到一千八百只。
    分层笼育的方法，作起来也是简单易行的。其作法是：用木（或者用砖头）制做一个像壁橱样子的笼，其中分成若干层，每层外边附挂上一个长形的饲槽，小鸡即生活在一层层的笼子里面。
