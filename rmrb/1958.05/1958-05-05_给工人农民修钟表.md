    Repairing Watches for Workers and Farmers
    It is common to see supply and marketing cooperatives, department stores, Xinhua bookstores, and others promoting goods door-to-door. However, it is the first time in our Haikou City that the watch repair industry in big cities has gone to the countryside to repair watches door-to-door.
    After putting forward the slogan of serving the countryside, serving production, serving workers and farmers, and serving transferred cadres, the watch repair industry in Haikou City organized three mobile service stations and rotated them to the towns, factories, farms, and construction sites in various districts and townships to repair watches door-to-door. The technicians they sent to the mobile service stations have relatively high skills, and the charging standards are the same as in the city, so they are deeply welcomed by the masses.

    给工人农民修钟表
    供销社、百货公司、新华书店等上门推销货物，已是常见。但大城市里的钟表修理业下乡上门修理钟表，在我们海口市还是头一回。
    海口市的钟表修理业在提出了面向农村，为生产、为工人、农民和为下放干部服务的口号后，就组织了三个流动服务站，轮回到各区乡的集镇、工厂、农场、工地去上门修理钟表。他们派在流动服务站里的技师，技术比较高，收费标准和城市里一样，因此深得群众欢迎。
