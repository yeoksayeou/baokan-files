　　Our National Flag Must Not Be Insulted
　　Upon seeing the news in the "People's Daily" on the 7th that the Japanese government, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly condoned thugs insulting our national flag, we are extremely angered by this provocative behavior.

　　The Chinese people have always loved peace and have the desire for friendly cooperation with the Japanese people. The facts of recent years have shown that the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people is growing stronger. However, Sino-Japanese friendship has offended the Kishi Nobusuke government, which has consistently followed the United States!

　　The Chinese stamp and paper-cut exhibition held by the Nagasaki branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association, which hung our national flag, reflected the Japanese people's eager desire to enhance friendly relations with our people. However, the Kishi Nobusuke government actually condoned Japanese thugs insulting the Chinese flag. This is a despicable act by the Kishi Nobusuke government in colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to antagonize our people; this is in fact a provocation against our people, which is intolerable. We now sternly warn the Kishi Nobusuke government: do not continue to bully others by flaunting your powerful connections, pretending to be crazy. Today's People's Republic of China is no longer the old China before the "September 18th Incident." The 600 million Chinese people who have stood up will never allow the Japanese government to arbitrarily insult our dignity! We want to express a serious protest to the Kishi Nobusuke government and demand that the Japanese government take swift action to punish the thugs who caused the incident!

　　After I read the news that the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, in collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, condoned thugs tearing down the sacred and solemn five-star red flag hanging at the Chinese stamp and paper-cut exhibition hall in Nagasaki City, I was extremely angry! The dignity of our motherland's national flag must not be barbarically insulted by anyone. The Kishi Nobusuke government must take full responsibility for this and must not allow the thugs to go unpunished!

　　Recently, the Kishi Nobusuke government's schemes to antagonize our country and poison Sino-Japanese relations have become increasingly blatant. It still ignores the strong desire of the vast Japanese people to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations and develop Sino-Japanese friendship, stubbornly follows the United States, and stubbornly refuses to recognize the People's Republic of China with its 600 million people. On the issue of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, it first created unnecessary complications, made unreasonable demands, and made all kinds of difficulties; later, it did not allow our trade representative offices to have the right to fly the national flag, undermining the trade agreement. It wanted to achieve the shameless goal of both doing business to make money and pleasing the US-Chiang Kai-shek clique. Before this incident of thugs tearing down our national flag, Japanese fishing boats had already continuously and illegally entered our East China Sea fishing ban zone, damaging our fishing boats and fishing gear, seriously undermining the Sino-Japanese Fisheries Agreement. This is by no means a mere coincidence. All this shows that the Kishi Nobusuke government completely disregards the interests and wishes of the Japanese people, acts against the tide of history, and tries every means to be hostile to the 600 million Chinese people.

　　However, the existence and development of the great People's Republic of China will not be affected by the likes or dislikes of the Kishi Nobusuke government. Kishi Nobusuke should wisely consider: what good will it do the Japanese people to continue to antagonize the Chinese people and follow the US ruling group? Today, with the Japanese people's movement demanding the development of Sino-Japanese friendship growing, this reactionary policy that is hostile to the interests of the Chinese and Japanese people will inevitably be met with increasingly resolute opposition from the Japanese people.

### 我国国旗决不容侮辱

　　我国国旗决不容侮辱
    见到7日“人民日报”这样一条消息：日本政府勾结蒋介石集团公开纵容暴徒侮辱我国国旗。我们对这种挑衅行为极为愤怒。
    我国人民向来热爱和平，对日本人民也有着友好合作的愿望。几年来的事实说明我们中国人民和日本人民之间的友谊日见增强。但是中日友好竟然触犯了一贯追随美国的岸信介政府！
    日中友好协会长崎市分会举办的中国邮票和剪纸展览会悬挂我国国旗，反映了日本人民迫切要求与我国人民增进友好关系的愿望。然而岸信介政府竟纵容日本暴徒侮辱中国国旗。这是岸信介政府勾结蒋介石匪帮敌视我国人民的卑鄙行为；这实际上是对我国人民的挑衅，使人无法容忍。我们现在正告岸信介政府：你们不要再狐假虎威、装疯卖傻，今天的中华人民共和国，已经不再是“九一八”以前的旧中国，六万万站立起来了的中国人民，决不允许日本政府任意侮辱我国的尊严！我们要向岸信介政府表示严重抗议，并要日本政府迅速作出处理，惩罚肇事暴徒！

    当我看了日本岸信介政府勾结蒋介石集团纵容暴徒扯下悬在长崎市中国邮票和剪纸展览会会场上的神圣庄严的五星红旗的消息以后，愤怒到了极点！我们祖国的国旗尊严，不许任何人野蛮地加以侮辱。岸信介政府对此必须全部负责，决不能让暴徒逍遥法外！
    最近以来，岸信介政府敌视我国、毒化中日关系的勾当越发变本加厉。至今仍然无视日本广大人民要求恢复中日邦交、发展中日友谊的强烈愿望，死心踏地追随美国，硬要闭起眼睛，拒不承认六亿人民的中华人民共和国。它在第四次中日贸易协定的问题上，先则节外生枝、无理取闹、百般刁难；以后又不许我国贸易代表机构有悬挂国旗的权利，破坏了贸易协定。它想达到既能做生意赚钱，又能讨好美蒋集团的无耻目的。在这次暴徒扯下我国国旗事件以前，日本渔轮早就连续非法侵入我国东海禁渔区，撞坏我国渔船、渔具，严重破坏了中日渔业协定，这决不是偶然的巧合。这一切说明：岸信介政府完全不顾日本人民的利益和愿望，倒行逆施，千方百计地要和六亿中国人民为敌。
    然而，伟大的中华人民共和国的存在和发展，是不会因岸信介政府的好恶而受到任何影响的。岸信介应该明智地深思一番：继续敌视中国人民、追随美国统治集团，对日本人民究竟有什么好处？在日本人民要求发展中日友好运动日益高涨的今天，这种敌视中日人民利益的反动政策必然会遭到日本人民日益坚决反对的。
