Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch: Since the 8th, most parts of the country have experienced rain. Among them, the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and Fujian Province have had rain in the past few days.

From 8:00 AM yesterday to 2:00 PM today, the rainfall in southeastern Xinjiang, eastern Qinghai, central and eastern Gansu, Shaanxi, and central Shanxi was 10 to 20 millimeters, equivalent to 0.4 to 0.8 市尺 (Chinese feet). The rainfall in the rest of Northwest, North China, and Inner Mongolia was 5 to 8 millimeters, equivalent to 0.2 to 0.4 市尺 (Chinese feet). In Beijing, central and northern Hebei, the rainfall was 10 millimeters until 8:00 PM today. The rainfall in some areas of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces was relatively small. This rainfall is extremely important and timely for sowing cotton and rice, fighting drought and rushing to sow, replanting seedlings, and the growth of wheat in these areas.

The provinces south of the Yangtze River, especially central and northern Hunan, central and southern Jiangxi, and Fujian, experienced the heaviest rainfall, with 40 to 70 millimeters, equivalent to 1.5 to 3 市尺 (Chinese feet). At present, some areas in the south have entered the plum rain season, and the rainfall has greatly exceeded that of previous years, which has an impact on the harvest of summer crops and the growth of crops.

Currently, the rain zone is moving southeast. It is estimated that there will still be rain in the provinces of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River today and tomorrow. Among them, southern Hebei, western Shandong, and northern Henan will have moderate to heavy rain, equivalent to 0.5 to 1.5 市尺 (Chinese feet). From tomorrow to the day after tomorrow, the rainfall in the provinces of the Huai River Basin and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will increase. There will be heavy rain to torrential rain in Jiangsu, central and southern Anhui, northern Jiangxi, and Zhejiang, equivalent to 2 to 3 市尺 (Chinese feet). These areas should pay close attention to flood prevention.
