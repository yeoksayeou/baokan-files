    Comrade Lieutenant, You Are So Good
    On February 23rd, my cousin was returning to Changsha from Beijing when he suddenly fell ill as the train pulled into Shijiazhuang. Immediately, the loudspeaker announced a request for a passenger to give up a berth. Before long, a tall Lieutenant military doctor came to my cousin's side and helped him onto a sleeper berth. Throughout the journey, this Lieutenant took care of my cousin with meticulous attention: finding a doctor to examine him, giving him injections, medicine, buying fruit, pouring boiling water...
    I eagerly asked the Lieutenant's name. My cousin said, "He is Comrade Xiao Zhenhu from a certain PLA unit stationed in Tianjin."
    This incident reminded me of something that happened ten years ago. One April, I was escorting my ailing mother back to Changsha from Guangzhou. When the train reached Chenxian, a Kuomintang army officer boarded, followed by about thirty soldiers. They entered the carriage, and without a word, ordered everyone in the carriage to get up, taking all the seats for themselves. I had no choice but to support my seriously ill mother, standing all the way to Changsha. These two events clearly show us the different styles of soldiers in two different societies.

    少尉同志，你真好
    2月23日，我表兄由北京回长沙，当列车开到石家庄时，他突然病倒了。随即广播器播出了希望乘客让出一个铺位的消息。不一会，一位身材高大的少尉军医来到我表兄身旁，把他扶到一个卧铺上睡下。一路上这个少尉无微不至的照顾着我表兄：找医师给他看病，打针，吃药，买水果，倒开水……。
    我急着问这位少尉的名字，表兄说：他是解放军某部驻天津部队的萧镇湖同志。
    这件事，使我联想起十年前的往事。有一年4月间，我由广州送害病的母亲回长沙，当车行至郴县时，上来一个国民党军队的军官，后面跟着三十来个士兵，他们走进车厢，二话没说，便把整个车厢的人赶起来，占坐了所有座位。我只好扶着病重的母亲，一直站到长沙。这两件事情，使我们清楚地看到两种不同社会的两种不同的军人作风。
