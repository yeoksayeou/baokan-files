Rampant Un-American Activities Committee
    Demons Run Wild

    According to a report in the American "National Vanguard" weekly in early March, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the 1958 funding for its Un-American Activities Committee: $300,005. The American "Stone Weekly" said that only one congressman expressed opposition to the activities of the Un-American Activities Committee during the House's discussion of the case.

    Gordon Scherer (Republican of Ohio), a member of the Un-American Activities Committee and a congressman, made a frantic anti-communist rant during a House meeting. In order to create a tense atmosphere, Scherer declared: "The United States is at war with the Soviet Union." He branded many groups and newspapers with slightly liberal leanings as "the core of the communist conspiracy."

    Francis Walter (Democrat of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Un-American Activities Committee, used another approach. He read letters written to him by aircraft manufacturers, defense plant managers, and others in the House of Representatives. These letters praised the "contributions" of the Un-American Activities Committee.

    Frantic Persecution

    Walter announced that in 1958, the Un-American Activities Committee would investigate six so-called major cases. In mid-February, the committee conducted its first hearing in Gary, Indiana. Fifteen steelworkers were accused of being "communists infiltrating the steel industry." The two main witnesses who testified were John Lautner, a notorious professional informer hired by the Un-American Activities Committee, and Joseph La Fleur, who American newspapers called the FBI's informant for fifteen years. During the hearing, the testimonies of the two main witnesses were full of contradictions and loopholes. Under the refutation of the interrogated, the two witnesses were speechless and embarrassed. The chairman of the Gary branch of the American Civil Liberties Union, who attended the hearing, said that the Un-American Activities Committee's interrogation was no different from a juggling performance. Because the witnesses could not justify themselves, the hearing ended hastily after two days. However, the Un-American Activities Committee's "investigations" and hearings on other cases are still in full swing, and the extremely reactionary American Legion is still touting and praising the Un-American Activities Committee everywhere.

    Unsuppressible Calls

    Despite the increasingly rampant activities of the Un-American Activities Committee, the American public's call to abolish this organization cannot be suppressed after all. Not long ago, sixty-one well-known social figures in Chicago jointly wrote to the House of Representatives saying: "... We ask the representatives to recognize that the privileges under which the House Un-American Activities Committee operates are too broad, and such privileges are often unrelated to the purpose of legislation. We ask the representatives to recognize that the activities of the Un-American Activities Committee endanger American values, and the results produced by the committee's working methods undermine the dignity and responsibility of the representatives.

    We demand the abolition of the House Un-American Activities Committee."

### 猖獗的非美活动调查委员会

    猖獗的非美活动调查委员会
    群魔乱舞
    据3月初美国“国民前卫”周刊报道，美国国会众议院通过了该院附属非美活动调查委员会1958年经费：三十万零五千美元。美国“斯通周刊”说，众议院讨论该案时，只有一名众议员对非美活动调查委员会的活动表示反对。
    非美活动调查委员会委员之一、众议员戈登·沙勒尔（俄亥俄州共和党人），在众议院开会时发出了疯狂的反共叫嚣。为了制造紧张的气氛，沙勒尔宣称：“美国正在与苏联进行着一种战争。”他把许多略带自由主义色彩的团体与报刊一概称为“共产党阴谋的核心。”
    非美活动调查委员会主席弗兰西斯·华尔特（宾夕法尼亚州民主党人）使用了另一套手法。他在众议院宣读了飞机制造商人、国防工厂经理等人写给他的信。这些信歌颂了非美活动调查委员会的“贡献”。
    疯狂的迫害
    华尔特宣布，1958年非美活动调查委员会将对六个所谓重大案件进行调查。2月中旬，该委员会在印第安纳州喀利城对第一个案件进行了传讯。十五名钢铁工人被控为“渗透入钢铁工业的共产主义分子”。出席作证的两名主要证人，一个是非美活动调查委员会雇用的特务、臭名昭著的职业告密者约翰·劳特纳，另一个是被美国报刊所称为联邦调查局十五年以来的眼线的约瑟夫·拉弗勒。在传讯过程中，两名主要证人的证词前后矛盾，漏洞百出，在被讯问者的反驳下，两名证人哑口无言，狼狈不堪。出席旁听的美国公民自由同盟喀利分会的主席说，非美活动调查委员会的讯问与杂技表演简直没有分别。由于证人无法自圆其说，讯问进行了两天就草草收场。但是非美活动调查委员会对其他各案的“调查”、传讯还在热烈地进行着，极端反动的美国退伍军人组织美国军团还在到处为非美活动调查委员会吹嘘捧场。
    抑止不住的呼声
    尽管非美活动调查委员会的活动日益猖獗，美国公众要求取消这个组织的呼声毕竟是抑止不住的。不久以前，芝加哥城六十一位知名的社会人士联名致函众议院说：“……我们要求众议员们认识：该院所属非美活动调查委员会所据以活动的特权过于广泛，而这种特权往往与立法的目的无关。我们要求众议员们认识非美活动调查委员会的活动危害了美国人的价值，该委员会工作方法所产生的结果有损众议员的尊严与职责。
    我们要求取消众议院非美活动调查委员会。”
