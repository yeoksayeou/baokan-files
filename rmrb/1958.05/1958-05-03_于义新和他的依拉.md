    Soldier's Life

    Yu Yixin and His Ira
    "I—ra!" A clear voice called from outside.
    "Who is shouting what?"
    "Yu Yixin is calling his military dog!" the deputy company commander said to me.
    "The call sounds so sweet, he must have a very good relationship with his military dog!"
    "That goes without saying!" Then, the deputy company commander told me the story of Yu Yixin and his military dog, Ira.
    Yu Yixin and Ira's close relationship is well-known. Whenever they need to cross a river during patrol, Yu Yixin always carries Ira on his shoulders. One night, it was raining heavily, and Yu Yixin took Ira across a small river to the mountain to set up an ambush post. When it was time to change shifts in the middle of the night, Yu Yixin and Ira couldn't return because the small river had flooded. So, Yu Yixin took Ira back to the post again and persevered until dawn. It rained continuously that night, and Yu Yixin put his only raincoat on Ira, preferring to let the rain soak his entire body. Yu Yixin fell ill the next day upon returning.
    The platoon leader said to him, "You're in bad shape, who told you to put the raincoat on Ira and get soaked yourself!"
    Yu Yixin opened his red eyes and said quietly, "It would be worse if Ira got sick, it can't speak and can't say where it hurts!"
    As for Ira, this pure yellow female dog, it also seemed to fully understand Yu Yixin's deep affection, and in the most critical moments, it desperately rescued its owner.
    One dark night, Yu Yixin was alone with Ira chasing a border-crossing criminal. Just as they were chasing to a bend in the mountain road, a huge rock flew out and hit Yu Yixin's chest. Yu Yixin staggered, and before he could steady himself, a tall special agent pounced on him. Thus, a fierce hand-to-hand combat unfolded. The enemy used his powerful arms to knock Yu Yixin down, and Yu Yixin felt the enemy pressing the muzzle of a submachine gun against his chest. At this critical moment, Ira barked in the dark and jumped over, biting the enemy's throat in one fell swoop...
    "Yu Yixin is a good soldier," the deputy company commander said, "He is calm, bold, not afraid of difficulties, and loyal to his duty. Last year, he caught many border-crossing criminals and received a third-class merit. The company is now preparing to report him for a second-class merit."
    "Amazing!" I said. Pushing open the window, I saw a young corporal, standing under a small pine tree with open arms, a pure yellow military dog ​​standing on its hind legs, putting its two front feet affectionately on his shoulders.
    "Yu Yixin, did you catch several smugglers last year?"
    Yu Yixin walked to the window with Ira and said to me, "No, it was the two of us, me and Ira!"
    "How many do you plan to catch this year!"
    "Ask my Ira!" He squatted down and hugged the military dog's neck: "Hey, little Ira, you say, you say, we won't lose face this year, will we!" (Hui Xuan) (Attached picture)

    于义新和他的依拉
    “依——拉！”一道清亮的嗓音在外面呼唤着。
    “谁在喊什么？”
    “于义新在喊他的军犬哩！”副连长对我说。
    “喊得真甜，他和军犬的感情一定很好吧！”
    “那还用说！”于是，副连长对我说起了于义新和他的军犬依拉的故事。
    于义新和依拉的亲密的关系是无人不晓的。每逢巡逻时要过河的时候，于义新总把依拉背到自己的肩上。有一天晚上下着大雨，于义新带着依拉淌过一道小河到山上去放潜伏哨。到半夜该换班的时候，于义新和依拉却回不来了，因为小河已经泛滥了。于是，于义新又带着依拉重新回到岗位上，一直坚持到天亮。这一夜不住地下着雨，于义新把仅有的一件雨衣披到了依拉的身上，自己宁愿让雨水湿透全身。第二天回来于义新就病倒了。
    排长对他说：“你真糟糕，谁叫你把雨衣给依拉披，自己挨浇！”
    于义新睁开通红的双眼，静静的说：“依拉要是病了就更糟了，它不会说话，哪儿难受也讲不出来！”
    而依拉呢，这匹毛色纯黄的母犬，也似乎完全懂得于义新的一片深情，在最危急的关头中，它就拼死地救援自己的主人。
    在一个漆黑的夜里。于义新独自带着依拉追捕一个越境分子。正追到山路的转弯处；突然一块巨石飞来，击中了于义新的胸脯。于义新踉跄了一下，没等站定脚跟，一个高大的特务就扑到了他的身上。于是，一场剧烈的徒手格斗展开了。敌人用有力的双臂把于义新摔倒了，于义新感觉到敌人将冲锋枪的枪口压向自己的胸膛。在这千钧一发之际，依拉在黑暗中吠了一声，猛窜过来，一下就咬住了敌人的喉咙……。
    “于义新是个好战士。”副连长说：“他沉着，大胆，不怕困难，忠于职责。去年他就抓住好多个越境分子，立了三等功，现在连里正准备给他报二等功。”
    “真了不起！”我说。推开窗户，我看见一个年青的下士，伸开双臂站在一棵小松树下，一匹纯黄的军犬用后腿站起来，把两只前脚亲密地搁在他的肩膀上。
    “于义新，你去年抓住过好几个偷渡犯吗？”
    “于义新带着依拉走向窗前对我说：“不，是我们俩，我和依拉！”
    “今年你打算抓多少呀！”
    “问我的依拉吧！”他蹲下来抱住军犬的脖颈：“嗳，小依拉，你说，你说，咱们今年不会丢人吧！”（惠宣）（附图片）
