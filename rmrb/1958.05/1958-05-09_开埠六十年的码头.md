    Sixty-Year-Old Dock
    Fujin County is a dock that has been open for sixty years. From here, heading northeast by east, the Songhua River converges with the Heilongjiang River, and then merges with the Ussuri River, flowing into the Amur River of the Soviet Union, and enters the Sea of Tartary, the Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk. Fujin County and the nearby counties of Luobei and Fuyuan are called the Three Rivers Confluence Area, which is rich in agriculture, fishery, and local products. Not far from Fujin County are the important emerging industrial cities of Jiamusi, Hegang, Shuangyashan coal mines, and the Yichun forestry area. On both banks of the Amur River in the Soviet Union, there are not only important agricultural areas, but also important industrial cities such as Khabarovsk, Nikolayevsk-on-Amur, and Komsomolsk-on-Amur, producing industrial products such as steel, petroleum, and machinery. The national borders and the connected rivers and lakes are navigable for about six months each year. After the merchant ships open to navigation, it will be of great significance for the exchange of goods between the two countries and the reduction of transportation costs.

    开埠六十年的码头
    富锦县是一个开埠六十年的码头。由这里再向东北偏东的方向走，松花江即和黑龙江汇合，而后与乌苏里江汇流，流入苏联的阿穆尔河，经鞑靼海峡进入日本海和鄂霍茨克海。富锦县和附近的萝北、抚远等几个县称三江汇流地区，农业、渔业、土产产品都很丰富。距离富锦县不远，有重要的新兴工业城市佳木斯、鹤岗、双鸭山煤矿和伊春林区。苏联境内阿穆尔河两岸，不但是重要的农业地区，而且有重要的工业城市伯力，庙街和共青城，出产钢铁、石油、机器等工业产品。两国国境及其相通的河流和湖泊，每年大约有六个月可以航行，商船通航后对两国物资交流，降低运输费用，意义很大。
