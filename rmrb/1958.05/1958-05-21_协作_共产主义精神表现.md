    Cooperation - A Manifestation of Communist Spirit

    In our era, the spirit of cooperation is spreading more and more widely. There is small-scale cooperation between societies and districts, and large-scale cooperation between counties and provinces.

    With cooperation, many things have completely changed.

    In the past, the idea of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep" was used by the feudal landlord class for a long time to obscure the understanding of the masses, thus forming a tradition. However, today, neighbors helping each other has become a fashion. This is a new change in the spiritual outlook of the peasant masses.

    Through cooperation, we have seen the great potential of the masses to transform nature. Marx once said that cooperation not only improves individual productivity, but also creates a new force. This is exactly the case. The work of Hebei and Shanxi provinces jointly harnessing the Mian River, and Ningxiang and Wangcheng counties jointly harnessing the Wei River, was unimaginable in the past, but today people have put it on the agenda. Because the spirit of cooperation makes people dare to think and act, improves people's confidence in conquering nature, and increases people's combat power.

    Through cooperation, we can also see that some views in society should also be re-evaluated. For example, in the understanding of many people, major natural disasters have always been irresistible. However, the fact that the people of Jiangxi overcame the torrential rains and floods powerfully proves that as long as everyone works together and promotes the spirit of collectivism, the people also have the power to reverse the situation in the face of natural disasters.

    协作——共产主义精神表现
    在我们这个时代，协作精神正在日益广泛地传扬着。有社与社、区与区之间小范围的协作，也有县与县、省与省之间大范围的协作。
    有了协作，许多事情全然变了样。
    过去，“各人自扫门前雪”的思想曾经被封建地主阶级长期利用来模糊群众的认识，因而形成为一种传统。但是，在今天，亲邻相帮却成为一种时尚。这是农民群众精神面貌的新变化。
    通过协作，我们看到了群众改造自然界的巨大潜力。马克思曾经说过，协作不仅提高了个人的生产力，而且创造了一种新的力量。事情正是如此。河北、山西两省共同治理绵河，宁乡、望城两县共同治理沩水的工作，过去是难以想像的，但今天人们已经把它提到行动日程上来了。因为协作精神使人们敢想敢为，提高了人们征服自然的信心，增长了人们的战斗力量。
    通过协作，我们还可以看到，社会上某些观点也应当重新给以估价。例如，在许多人的认识中，重大的自然灾害一向是不能抗拒的。但是，像江西人民战胜暴雨洪水的事又有力地证明，只要大家通力合作，发扬集体主义精神，在自然灾害面前人民也有回天的力量。
