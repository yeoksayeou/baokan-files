Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 20th: Hundreds of thousands of Indonesian army, navy, air force personnel, and people from all walks of life held a massive demonstration and mass rally today to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Indonesian National Awakening Day, demonstrating the strong power and determination of the Indonesian people to oppose foreign interference and eliminate the rebel groups.

The parade, led by the army, navy, and air force, began at 8:00 AM. They passed in front of the Independence Palace, where they were reviewed by President Sukarno. This was followed by contingents of workers, farmers, youth, students, women, and veterans. They shouted slogans and held up placards. The placards read: "Oppose the U.S. and Chiang Kai-shek clique's adventurers interfering in Indonesian internal affairs!" "Suppress the rebel groups!"

Representatives from various political parties participated in the demonstration. The last contingent was from the "Mass Movement Against Foreign Interference," composed of twenty-seven mass organizations. They shouted: "Dissolve SEATO!"

President Sukarno delivered a speech at the mass rally held after the parade. He said that since the Indonesian national awakening activities began in 1908, the goals of the Indonesian national revolution have become increasingly clear over these fifty years. He said that experience has taught us not to cooperate with imperialism. Only by opposing imperialism can we achieve the goals of national independence, freedom, and happiness.

Sukarno said that every nation has the right to manage its own country according to its own characteristics, and no one has the right to interfere or force it to change.

Sukarno said that at a time when Indonesia is facing foreign interference and aggression, and facing disturbances from domestic rebel groups, all Indonesian people must unite as one, and unhesitatingly defend the Republic of Indonesia. As long as the government, the armed forces, and the people are united, final victory can be achieved, and the imperialist obstacles to Indonesia can be crushed. Indonesia will continue to move forward until the liberation of West Irian and the achievement of complete national independence.

Before Sukarno's speech, the chairman of the conference preparatory committee, Indonesian Second Deputy Prime Minister Idham Chalid, spoke about the history of Indonesian National Awakening Day.

The first Indonesian national movement organization, Budi Utomo (Noble Endeavor), was founded on May 20, 1908. Because Budi Utomo played a role in enlightening Indonesian national consciousness, the Indonesian people designated this day as National Awakening Day. This year, the Indonesian government decided to expand the celebration of this anniversary to express Indonesia's determination to oppose foreign interference and defend national independence and sovereignty. Today, grand commemorative gatherings were also held throughout Indonesia.

    雅加达数十万军民示威游行
    反对美蒋干涉印度尼西亚内政
    苏加诺号召人民紧密团结保卫共和国
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚陆海空军和各界人民数十万人今天举行巨大的示威游行和群众大会，纪念印度尼西亚民族觉醒日五十周年，显示了印度尼西亚人民反对外国干涉和消灭叛乱集团的坚强力量和决心。
    由陆海空军带头的队伍在上午八时开始举行示威游行，他们经过独立宫的前面，在那里受苏加诺总统检阅。随后是工人、农民、青年、学生、妇女和退伍军人的队伍。他们高呼口号，高举着标语牌。标语牌上面写道：“反对美国和蒋介石集团冒险分子干涉印度尼西亚内政！”“镇压叛乱集团！”
    各党派的代表的队伍参加了示威游行，最后是由二十七个民众团体组成的“反对外国干涉群众运动”的队伍，他们高呼：“解散东南亚条约组织！”
    在游行结束后举行的群众大会上，苏加诺总统发表了演讲。他说，自从1908年印度尼西亚的民族觉醒活动展开以来，印度尼西亚民族革命的目标在这五十年间越来越清楚了。他说，经验教导我们，不要同帝国主义合作。只有反对帝国主义，才能达到民族独立、自由和幸福的目标。
    苏加诺说，每一个民族都有权按照自己的特点来管理自己的国家，任何人都没有理由加以干预或者强迫它作改变。
    苏加诺说，在目前印度尼西亚面对着外国的干涉和侵略并面对着国内叛乱集团的骚动的时候，全体印度尼西亚人民必须团结得像一个人一样，毫不犹疑地保卫印度尼西亚共和国，只要政府、武装部队和人民团结起来，就一定可以得到最后胜利，也可以粉碎帝国主义对印度尼西亚的阻碍，印度尼西亚将继续前进，直到解放西伊里安和取得完全的民族独立。
    在苏加诺讲话前，大会筹备委员会主席、印度尼西亚第二副总理伊达姆·哈利德在会上讲述了印度尼西亚民族觉醒日的历史。
    印度尼西亚第一个民族运动团体——良知社，是在1908年5月20日成立的，由于良知社对于启发印度尼西亚民族觉悟起了作用，印度尼西亚人民就把这一天定为民族觉醒日。今年，印度尼西亚政府决定扩大庆祝这个纪念日，以表示印度尼西亚反对外国干涉和保卫民族独立和主权的决心。今天，印度尼西亚全国各地也都举行了盛大的纪念集会。
