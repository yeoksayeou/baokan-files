Looking at Afforestation Work Across the Province from One Township
Du Zheheng, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Last year, I inspected the western mountainous areas of Liaoning Province. This area was full of barren mountains and serious soil erosion, which the masses called "Many mountains, none not bald; many rivers, none not dry." However, Qiupi Ditch and Bapan Ditch in Beisijiazi Township, Chaoyang County, had several mountains covered with lush trees. While greening, they also vigorously built terraced fields and check dams, achieving "Every mountain has fields, every cultivated land has dams, dams are connected, and terraces surround the mountains." Because soil erosion was controlled, there was a constant flow of water in the ditch, and the cooperative also made the tableland water conservancy, thus greatly increasing the yield. For example, more than 50 mu of tableland in a ditch in Bapan Ditch produced an average of 720 jin of corn per mu. The masses proudly said, "High yield comes from high mountains." This township used to rely on government allocation of relief grain, but in 1956 it sold 200,000 jin of surplus grain. After seeing the situation in this township, people's confidence in changing the face of barren mountains and developing production in poor mountainous areas was greatly enhanced.

The Experience of Greening in Beisijiazi Township

The greening of Qiupi Ditch and Bapan Ditch was done by the masses themselves. In the past few years, the state had invested a large amount of funds in this county to build large state-owned forests, and had also vigorously organized and supported cooperatives to plant many forests, but it did not have such a significant effect. Why? It turns out that there are several issues worthy of attention and study in the greening work here.

Their greening first adopted the method of closing mountains. Qiupi Ditch was closed early, for twenty or thirty years; Bapan Ditch has only been closed for seven or eight years, but it has also grown quite dense trees. Originally, even the mountains with serious soil erosion and exposed rocks, as long as they were closed, could grow shrubs and miscellaneous trees in three or five years relying on the growth of surviving roots and the natural propagation of seeds. The masses said, "No trees in three years, no people in five years," which means that if you can't see the trees growing in three years, they will be taller than people in five years. These mountains were grown using the method of closing mountains. Of course, the trees grow more disorderly, but they quickly played a role in protecting and fertilizing the topsoil.

The second is fast growth. The fast-growing tree species here is poplar. The rows of tall poplars, in addition to some being naturally grown by closing mountains, are all planted by them. Planting poplar strips in riveræ»©s, foothills, and mountain ditches has an almost 100% survival rate, and they can grow to the thickness of a bowl in four or five years and three or four zhang high. Qiupi Ditch also combines the construction of check dams, planting a piece of poplar every other check dam, so that the next check dam will accumulate humus soil more quickly, forming fertile tableland. Poplars grow fast, not only quickly maintaining soil and water, but also solving the local fuel difficulties.

Third, quick benefits. After closing the mountains, they planted a large number of mountain apricots on some mountains closer to the villages. The proportion of mountain apricots is second only to poplars. There are also some walnut, pear, and jujube trees on the mountains, but not as many as mountain apricots. This is because mountain apricots have faster benefits than other economic forests (mountain apricot kernels are an important sideline income in this area), they begin to bear fruit in three years, and planting is extremely simple, so it meets the masses' requirements of spending less labor and getting benefits early.

Shortcomings in Afforestation Work in Other Areas

People can't help but ask: Why haven't the forests built by the state and the forests built by cooperatives under the guidance of the state played such a significant role as Beisijiazi Township? There is no doubt that we have made great achievements in afforestation work in recent years. These forests, especially state-owned forests, will certainly have greater advantages and play a greater role than the forests built by the masses after several years of becoming forests, because they are planted and managed according to scientific and technological standards; however, the time has been delayed, and they cannot temporarily show their role. And time is the most important thing, and the losses caused by the delay of time are incalculable. It should be clear that the specifications and standards of afforestation, whether the value is high or low after becoming timber, should be paid attention to, but this is not the most important issue in any place. Being able to achieve greening one day earlier, being able to protect soil and water and eliminate water and drought disasters one day earlier, thereby greatly promoting the development of agricultural and forestry production, is our highest and greatest requirement. Therefore, while affirming the achievements of tree planting and afforestation in the past few years, we must admit that our work has committed some shortcomings that are opposite to the characteristics of Beisijiazi Township. First, in many places where the method of closing mountains could have been used to naturally cultivate forests, we went to engage in artificial afforestation, wasting state funds and manpower; second, there were many fast-growing tree species in the local area, but we did not use them, but the state supplied seedlings and planted a large number of black pines (it takes six or seven years for black pines to play a role in maintaining soil and water, and a hundred years to become timber), which greatly delayed the urgently needed soil and water conservation efficiency; third, black pines have high economic value, but grow extremely slowly, and cannot meet the masses' requirements for early benefits, so the masses are not as concerned about black pines as they are about tree species with faster benefits, which cannot but have an adverse effect on the protection and management of black pines; the final conclusion is that there is a lack of thinking about believing in and relying on the masses. In this way, we can ask ourselves such a question: If we were smarter and avoided these shortcomings earlier, could we have done more, faster, better, and more economically with the same funds and the same manpower? Yes, that's right. We should maintain our past advantages while also possessing the advantages of Beisijiazi Township, which is our task.

Methods for Carrying Out Afforestation Work in the Future

Our province has determined to complete the task of afforestation within three years. The method is to let go of mobilizing the masses and take correct measures. The first is to close mountains. We estimate that about half of the barren mountains in the western mountainous areas can be used to cultivate forests by closing mountains. The population density in the western mountainous areas is small, and farmland requires a large number of laborers, so this can greatly save manpower and financial resources, and do more things in other farmland construction. There is a contradiction between closing mountains and grazing and firewood cutting, which needs to be planned uniformly by the township. Pastures should be unified, and alfalfa and sweet clover should be planted as much as possible in designated pastures to increase production; at the same time, actively improve local sheep breeds (goats destroy mountains), and develop appropriately according to the pasture conditions to ensure the implementation of mountain closure measures. The problem of firewood should be solved from two aspects. First, the distribution of coal mines in the western mountainous areas is extremely wide, and it is necessary to support agricultural societies in developing small coal kilns; second, the township should delineate some indispensable firewood fields to protect the newly grown shrubs and grass in the closed mountain areas from damage.

The second is fast growth. Fast-growing tree species must be promoted in mass afforestation, and economic value cannot be unduly emphasized. Any tree that grows fast is good, and early greening is the greatest economic value. Plant whatever fast-growing tree species are available locally, and promote fast-growing tree species in the same way as promoting high-yield crops, the more the better.

Third, we should pay attention to combining the long-term interests and current interests of the masses in building economic forests. The current situation is completely different from the spontaneous tree planting of small farmers before the cooperativization; however, this does not mean that the immediate interests of the masses cannot be taken care of. Cooperatives can plan to build various economic forests and timber forests; but it is also necessary to start from meeting the requirements of the vast masses for early benefits, so as to better mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and carry out long-term forestry construction.

Fourth, and fundamentally, is to let go of mobilizing the masses and resolutely rely on the masses. Afforestation does not rely on the state to provide people and money. It is absolutely necessary for the state to build economic forests for a century-long plan. However, state afforestation is mainly in deep mountains, large areas, and places where the masses cannot reach. The basic problem lies in mobilizing the masses. It is a politically ignorant and conservative approach to simply rely on the forestry survey team to investigate and calculate the speed of greening. At present, the great leap forward in agricultural production is developing vigorously, and we must rely on the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, ride the wind and waves, and make a great leap forward in forestry production to accelerate the progress of afforestation. In the practice of mobilizing the masses to afforest: first, we must resolutely change the stupid method of supplying seedlings from state nurseries (nurseries only engage in state afforestation), mobilize cooperatives to "collect, cultivate, and plant themselves," as long as the masses take action, the cooperative will take out nursery land to cultivate seedlings according to needs, and there will be no difficulty in the tree seedling problem. Secondly, afforestation should be closely combined with soil and water conservation and land preparation projects. In the current production upsurge, mobilize cooperatives to repair horizontal ditches, dig fish scale pits, plant forest belts, and combine the construction of check dams and land preparation to plant trees, so as to achieve the effect of water storage, soil conservation, drought resistance and flood prevention in one fell swoop. The first year determines the next three years, and this year is the key to the decision. We are preparing to launch a large-scale "every society afforests, every household plants trees" movement, greatly promote the advanced experience of thousand-mu forest societies and ten-thousand-mu forest societies, and carry out three "assaults" this year, with the secretaries taking action, mobilizing the whole people, planting trees together, and organizing several evaluations and carrying out competitions, so as to strive to basically complete the planting of trees around the four sides this year, resolutely march towards barren mountains, and close mountains and afforestation on a large scale, laying the foundation for completing the afforestation task in three years.
