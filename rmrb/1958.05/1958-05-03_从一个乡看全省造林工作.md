Looking at Afforestation Work Across the Province from One Township
Du Zheheng, Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Last year, I inspected the western mountainous areas of Liaoning Province. This area was full of barren mountains and serious soil erosion, which the masses called "Many mountains, none not bald; many rivers, none not dry." However, Qiupi Ditch and Bapan Ditch in Beisijiazi Township, Chaoyang County, had several mountains covered with lush trees. While greening, they also vigorously built terraced fields and check dams, achieving "Every mountain has fields, every cultivated land has dams, dams are connected, and terraces surround the mountains." Because soil erosion was controlled, there was a constant flow of water in the ditch, and the cooperative also made the tableland water conservancy, thus greatly increasing the yield. For example, more than 50 mu of tableland in a ditch in Bapan Ditch produced an average of 720 jin of corn per mu. The masses proudly said, "High yield comes from high mountains." This township used to rely on government allocation of relief grain, but in 1956 it sold 200,000 jin of surplus grain. After seeing the situation in this township, people's confidence in changing the face of barren mountains and developing production in poor mountainous areas was greatly enhanced.

The Experience of Greening in Beisijiazi Township

The greening of Qiupi Ditch and Bapan Ditch was done by the masses themselves. In the past few years, the state had invested a large amount of funds in this county to build large state-owned forests, and had also vigorously organized and supported cooperatives to plant many forests, but it did not have such a significant effect. Why? It turns out that there are several issues worthy of attention and study in the greening work here.

Their greening first adopted the method of closing mountains. Qiupi Ditch was closed early, for twenty or thirty years; Bapan Ditch has only been closed for seven or eight years, but it has also grown quite dense trees. Originally, even the mountains with serious soil erosion and exposed rocks, as long as they were closed, could grow shrubs and miscellaneous trees in three or five years relying on the growth of surviving roots and the natural propagation of seeds. The masses said, "No trees in three years, no people in five years," which means that if you can't see the trees growing in three years, they will be taller than people in five years. These mountains were grown using the method of closing mountains. Of course, the trees grow more disorderly, but they quickly played a role in protecting and fertilizing the topsoil.

The second is fast growth. The fast-growing tree species here is poplar. The rows of tall poplars, in addition to some being naturally grown by closing mountains, are all planted by them. Planting poplar strips in river滩s, foothills, and mountain ditches has an almost 100% survival rate, and they can grow to the thickness of a bowl in four or five years and three or four zhang high. Qiupi Ditch also combines the construction of check dams, planting a piece of poplar every other check dam, so that the next check dam will accumulate humus soil more quickly, forming fertile tableland. Poplars grow fast, not only quickly maintaining soil and water, but also solving the local fuel difficulties.

Third, quick benefits. After closing the mountains, they planted a large number of mountain apricots on some mountains closer to the villages. The proportion of mountain apricots is second only to poplars. There are also some walnut, pear, and jujube trees on the mountains, but not as many as mountain apricots. This is because mountain apricots have faster benefits than other economic forests (mountain apricot kernels are an important sideline income in this area), they begin to bear fruit in three years, and planting is extremely simple, so it meets the masses' requirements of spending less labor and getting benefits early.

Shortcomings in Afforestation Work in Other Areas

People can't help but ask: Why haven't the forests built by the state and the forests built by cooperatives under the guidance of the state played such a significant role as Beisijiazi Township? There is no doubt that we have made great achievements in afforestation work in recent years. These forests, especially state-owned forests, will certainly have greater advantages and play a greater role than the forests built by the masses after several years of becoming forests, because they are planted and managed according to scientific and technological standards; however, the time has been delayed, and they cannot temporarily show their role. And time is the most important thing, and the losses caused by the delay of time are incalculable. It should be clear that the specifications and standards of afforestation, whether the value is high or low after becoming timber, should be paid attention to, but this is not the most important issue in any place. Being able to achieve greening one day earlier, being able to protect soil and water and eliminate water and drought disasters one day earlier, thereby greatly promoting the development of agricultural and forestry production, is our highest and greatest requirement. Therefore, while affirming the achievements of tree planting and afforestation in the past few years, we must admit that our work has committed some shortcomings that are opposite to the characteristics of Beisijiazi Township. First, in many places where the method of closing mountains could have been used to naturally cultivate forests, we went to engage in artificial afforestation, wasting state funds and manpower; second, there were many fast-growing tree species in the local area, but we did not use them, but the state supplied seedlings and planted a large number of black pines (it takes six or seven years for black pines to play a role in maintaining soil and water, and a hundred years to become timber), which greatly delayed the urgently needed soil and water conservation efficiency; third, black pines have high economic value, but grow extremely slowly, and cannot meet the masses' requirements for early benefits, so the masses are not as concerned about black pines as they are about tree species with faster benefits, which cannot but have an adverse effect on the protection and management of black pines; the final conclusion is that there is a lack of thinking about believing in and relying on the masses. In this way, we can ask ourselves such a question: If we were smarter and avoided these shortcomings earlier, could we have done more, faster, better, and more economically with the same funds and the same manpower? Yes, that's right. We should maintain our past advantages while also possessing the advantages of Beisijiazi Township, which is our task.

Methods for Carrying Out Afforestation Work in the Future

Our province has determined to complete the task of afforestation within three years. The method is to let go of mobilizing the masses and take correct measures. The first is to close mountains. We estimate that about half of the barren mountains in the western mountainous areas can be used to cultivate forests by closing mountains. The population density in the western mountainous areas is small, and farmland requires a large number of laborers, so this can greatly save manpower and financial resources, and do more things in other farmland construction. There is a contradiction between closing mountains and grazing and firewood cutting, which needs to be planned uniformly by the township. Pastures should be unified, and alfalfa and sweet clover should be planted as much as possible in designated pastures to increase production; at the same time, actively improve local sheep breeds (goats destroy mountains), and develop appropriately according to the pasture conditions to ensure the implementation of mountain closure measures. The problem of firewood should be solved from two aspects. First, the distribution of coal mines in the western mountainous areas is extremely wide, and it is necessary to support agricultural societies in developing small coal kilns; second, the township should delineate some indispensable firewood fields to protect the newly grown shrubs and grass in the closed mountain areas from damage.

The second is fast growth. Fast-growing tree species must be promoted in mass afforestation, and economic value cannot be unduly emphasized. Any tree that grows fast is good, and early greening is the greatest economic value. Plant whatever fast-growing tree species are available locally, and promote fast-growing tree species in the same way as promoting high-yield crops, the more the better.

Third, we should pay attention to combining the long-term interests and current interests of the masses in building economic forests. The current situation is completely different from the spontaneous tree planting of small farmers before the cooperativization; however, this does not mean that the immediate interests of the masses cannot be taken care of. Cooperatives can plan to build various economic forests and timber forests; but it is also necessary to start from meeting the requirements of the vast masses for early benefits, so as to better mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses and carry out long-term forestry construction.

Fourth, and fundamentally, is to let go of mobilizing the masses and resolutely rely on the masses. Afforestation does not rely on the state to provide people and money. It is absolutely necessary for the state to build economic forests for a century-long plan. However, state afforestation is mainly in deep mountains, large areas, and places where the masses cannot reach. The basic problem lies in mobilizing the masses. It is a politically ignorant and conservative approach to simply rely on the forestry survey team to investigate and calculate the speed of greening. At present, the great leap forward in agricultural production is developing vigorously, and we must rely on the high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses, ride the wind and waves, and make a great leap forward in forestry production to accelerate the progress of afforestation. In the practice of mobilizing the masses to afforest: first, we must resolutely change the stupid method of supplying seedlings from state nurseries (nurseries only engage in state afforestation), mobilize cooperatives to "collect, cultivate, and plant themselves," as long as the masses take action, the cooperative will take out nursery land to cultivate seedlings according to needs, and there will be no difficulty in the tree seedling problem. Secondly, afforestation should be closely combined with soil and water conservation and land preparation projects. In the current production upsurge, mobilize cooperatives to repair horizontal ditches, dig fish scale pits, plant forest belts, and combine the construction of check dams and land preparation to plant trees, so as to achieve the effect of water storage, soil conservation, drought resistance and flood prevention in one fell swoop. The first year determines the next three years, and this year is the key to the decision. We are preparing to launch a large-scale "every society afforests, every household plants trees" movement, greatly promote the advanced experience of thousand-mu forest societies and ten-thousand-mu forest societies, and carry out three "assaults" this year, with the secretaries taking action, mobilizing the whole people, planting trees together, and organizing several evaluations and carrying out competitions, so as to strive to basically complete the planting of trees around the four sides this year, resolutely march towards barren mountains, and close mountains and afforestation on a large scale, laying the foundation for completing the afforestation task in three years.

    从一个乡看全省造林工作
    中共辽宁省委书记　杜者蘅
    去年，我视察了我们辽宁省的西部山区。这一带全是童山秃岭，水土流失非常严重，群众称为“山多，无山不秃；河多，无河不干”。而朝阳县北四家子乡秋皮沟和八盘沟却有几座山是林木丛生，遍山葱绿。这里在绿化的同时，还大力修了梯田、谷坊，做到“有山皆有田，耕地皆有堰，堰坝相连，环山梯田”。由于控制了水土流失，沟里有了常流水，合作社又使台地水利化，因此大大地提高了产量。如八盘沟一条沟里的五十余市亩台地平均每亩产苞米七百二十斤，群众自豪地说“高产出在高山上”。这个乡过去是靠政府拨救济粮款过活的，1956年却卖出余粮二十万斤。看了这个乡的情况，使人对于改变童山秃岭的面貌，发展贫瘠山区的生产，大大地增强了信心。
    北四家子乡实现绿化的经验
    秋皮沟和八盘沟上头的绿化，是群众自己搞的。几年来国家在这个县曾投了大批资金，营造了大片国有林，也曾大力组织与扶助合作社造了很多林，但却没有起到这么明显的效果。为什么呢？原来这里的绿化工作中有几个值得重视和研究的问题。
    他们的绿化首先是采取了封山的办法。秋皮沟封的早，已有二、三十年；八盘沟上头封山仅七、八年，但亦长起相当茂密的林木。原来这里即使是水土流失严重、岩石裸露的山峰，只要封了山，依靠遗根滋长和种籽的自然传播，有三、五年也可以长起荆条和灌、杂木。群众说是“三年不见树，五年不见人”，就是说如果三年还见不到树长大，五年却要没过人了。这里的几座山就是用封山办法育起林来的。当然，林木长的比较杂乱，但却迅速起到保护和肥沃表土的作用。
    第二是速生。这里的速生树种是山杨。成排的高大的杨树，除了一部是封山自然长成的以外，都是他们种植的。在河滩、山脚和山沟里插杨树条子，成活率几乎是百分之百，有四、五年就可以长到碗口粗，三、四丈高。秋皮沟还结合修谷坊，每隔一道谷坊种植上一片杨树，使下一道谷坊更快地淤积腐植土，弄成肥沃的台子地。杨树长得快，不但迅速保持水土，还解决了当地的燃料上的困难。
    第三，收益快。封山以后，在一些比较靠近村庄的山上，他们种植了大量的山杏。山杏的比重仅次于杨树。山上还有一些核桃、梨、枣之类的树，但没有山杏多。这是因为山杏比其它经济林木收益来的快（山杏核是这一带的重要副业收入之一），三年就开始结果，又加种植极简单，所以符合群众的少花工、早得益的要求。
    其它地区  造林工作中的缺点
    人们不禁要问：为什么国家营造的和由国家指导合作社营造的林，远没有起到北四家子乡这么显著的作用呢？毫无疑问，近几年来我们在造林工作上是有很大成绩的。这些林，尤其是国营造林，由于是按着科学技术栽植和抚育的，经过若干年成林之后，一定会比群众造的林具有更大的优越性，发挥更大的作用；但是，时间却拖延了，它们暂时还不能显示出作用来。而时间是最重要的，由于时间拖延而造成的损失也是无可估量的。应该明确：造林的规格、标准好不好、高不高，成材以后价值是大是小，虽然应该注意，但这不是在任何地方都有头等重要意义的问题。能早一天实现绿化，能早一天保住水土、消除水旱灾害，从而大大促进农林生产的发展，这是我们最高、最大的要求。因此，我们在肯定过去几年植树造林的成就的同时，就必须承认：我们的工作中犯有同北四家子乡所具有的特点相反的一些缺点。第一是，在许多本可以用封山办法来自然育林的地方，我们却去搞人工造林，浪费了国家的资金和人力；第二是，当地本来有许多速生树种，我们没有用它，而由国家供应树苗，栽植了大量的黑松（黑松要六、七年才能起到保持水土作用，百年才能成材），大大延缓了迫切需要的水土保持的效能；第三是，黑松经济价值高，但成长极慢，不能适应群众的收益早的要求，因此群众对黑松没有对收益较快的树种那么关心，这对黑松的保护、抚育上不能不引起不利的影响；最后归结到一点，就是缺乏相信与依靠群众的思想。这样，我们就可以提出这样一个问题来自问：如果我们更聪明一些，早日避免了这些缺点，用同样的资金，用同样的人力，是不是可以把造林工作搞得更多一些、更快一些、更好一些、更省一些呢？是的，是这样的。我们今后应该在保持过去的优点的同时，兼备北四家子乡那样的优点，这就是我们的任务。
    今后开展造林工作的办法
    我省已经确定要在三年内完成植树造林的任务。办法就是：放手发动群众，采取正确措施。首先是封山。我们估计西部山区的童山秃岭中可能有一半左右，可以依靠封山的办法来育起林木来。西部山区人口密度较小，农田又需要大批劳动力，这么办可以大大节约人力、财力，在其他农田建设方面干更多的事情。封山和放牧、打柴有矛盾，需由乡统一规划。牧场应统一划定，在指定的牧场尽可能多种苜蓿、草木樨等，提高产量；同时积极改良当地羊种（山羊破坏山），根据牧场情况适当发展，以保证封山措施的实行。烧柴问题要从两个方面解决，一是西部山区煤矿分布面极广，要支持农业社大搞小煤窑；二是由乡划定一些必不可少的柴场，以保护封山地区刚长起的荆条、草木不受破坏。
    第二是速生。群众造林一定要提倡速生树种，不能不适当地强调经济价值。凡是长得快的树就好，早日绿化就是最大的经济价值。当地有什么速生树种就搞什么树种，要像推广高产作物那样来推广速生树种，多多益善。
    第三，造经济林木要注意使群众的长远利益和当前利益结合起来。现在和合作化前的小农自发植树的情况根本不同了；但是这不等于可以不照顾群众的眼前利益。合作社可以有计划地营造各种经济林、用材林；但也必须注意从解决广大群众的早得收益的要求入手，来更好地调动群众的积极性，进行长期的林业建设。
    第四，也是根本的，就是放手发动群众和坚决依靠群众。造林不是依靠国家出人出钱，国家百年大计营造经济林，是十分必需的。但国家造林主要是在深山、面积大、群众力所不及的地方。基本问题在于发动群众。单纯依靠林业勘测队来调查和计算绿化速度，是一种不懂政治的保守作法。目前农业生产大跃进正在风起云涌地发展，我们必须依靠群众的高涨的革命干劲，乘风破浪，来一个林业生产大跃进，以加速造林进度。在发动群众造林的作法上：首先要坚决改变由国家苗圃供应苗木的笨办法（苗圃只搞国家造林），发动合作社“自采、自育、自栽”，只要群众动手，合作社根据需要拿出育苗地育苗，树苗问题就没有困难。其次造林要同水土保持和整地工程密切结合，在当前的生产高潮中，发动合作社修水平沟、挖鱼鳞坑、植穿林带以及结合修谷坊整地等植树造林，以便一举取得蓄水保土、抗旱防涝的效果。三年看头年，今年是决定关键，我们准备开展一个规模宏大的“社社造林、户户植树”运动，大大推广千亩林社、万亩林社的先进经验，今年搞三次“突击”，由书记动手，全民动员，一齐动手植树造林，并且组织几次评比，开展竞赛，从而力求在今年基本完成四旁植树，坚决向童山秃岭进军，大面积地封山和造林，为三年完成造林任务打下基础。
