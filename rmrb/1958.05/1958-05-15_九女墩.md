　　Nine Ladies Mound
    Zhao Puchu
    During the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom era, Wuchang was captured by the Qing army. Nine women, refusing to surrender, died. The people buried their remains by East Lake, calling it Nine Ladies Mound.

　　Tianjing long besieged, no one rebelled,
　　Wuchang thrice broken, fighting fiercely unto death,
　　There were women who bravely died for the nation,
　　The spirit of the Taiping can be fully seen.
　　Why need these green tombs bear names?
　　Their loyal bones of a thousand autumns shall become fragrant orchids.
　　How many ornamental columns have turned to dust,
　　Nine Ladies Mound shall forever shine over East Lake.

　　九女墩
    赵朴初
    太平天国时，武昌为清军所破，有女子九人，不屈而死，人民埋其尸骨于东湖，称之为九女墩。
　　天京久困无一叛，
　　武昌三破争死战，
　　有女慷慨为国殇，
　　太平风义可概见。
　　青冢何须着姓名？
　　千秋忠骨作兰馨。
　　几多华表成尘土，
　　永耀东湖九女墩。
