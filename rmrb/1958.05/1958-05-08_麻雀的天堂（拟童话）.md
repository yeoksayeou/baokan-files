The Sparrow's Paradise (A Fable)
崔奇

In the spring of 1958, China began a war unprecedented in history: 600 million people declared war on sparrows, determined to completely eliminate these harmful birds from Chinese soil. The Chinese people were not just talking; they meant what they said, and as usual, they did even more and even better than they said. From cities to villages, the whole of China was covered with nets, making it truly difficult for the sparrows to fly. Their end had come.

At this time, a flock of sparrows escaped to a forest. But they soon discovered that it was not a safe place either. What were they to do? The sparrows discussed it animatedly. The oldest sparrow came up with an idea. It said loudly: "I suggest we move!"

"Move to where?" the younger sparrows asked in unison.

"Children, I read in the newspaper that there is a place called America, where the government is hostile to the Chinese people, but indifferent to the lives of the American people. If we move there, maybe we can live a good life."

"But where is that country?"

"I heard it's across the ocean."

So, this flock of sparrows unanimously decided: to move across the ocean!

They flew and flew, across the ocean, and finally flew over America. Below was a lush expanse of crops.

"Look, the crops here are almost the same as in China," said one sparrow.

They continued to fly forward and discovered some strange sights. Many fields were fenced in with wooden boards, and were full of weeds. There were also many wooden signs stuck in the fields, with the words: "A big prairie is to be opened here…"

"What's going on?" The young sparrows really didn't understand.

The old sparrow told them: "This is the American government's order, to reduce the cultivated land area. Someone once suggested destroying ten million hectares of cultivated land, letting it lie barren and become a prairie."

"Why?"

"Why? It is said that because there is a surplus of grain, the government tells farmers not to plant so much land anymore."

"Ah, a good place, they can't finish the grain…"

"Not can't finish, it's a surplus!" the old sparrow corrected. "Now there are millions of unemployed people in America, and tens of millions of families still can't afford enough food. As for the farmers, their lives are not easy either."

"If that's the case, won't we starve if we come here?" This question really worried the sparrows.

With faint hope, they continued to fly forward. A big city appeared below.

The old sparrow thought to itself: If only I could get a newspaper to read. Sure enough, they picked up a "Chicago Daily Tribune." Although the newspaper was old and yellowed, coincidentally, there happened to be an editorial about Chinese sparrows on it, which was not out of date. Below is a paragraph from the editorial:

"The United States government might make a deal with Communist China that would be mutually beneficial. The Communists should not eliminate the sparrows, but capture them alive and send them to us. Then these sparrows can be released to deal with (!) America's surplus agricultural products. Every grain they eat in the fields will help reduce the tons of agricultural products that the government must buy at subsidized prices and then store at considerable expense…" (Note)

This is simply a welcome address from America to the Chinese sparrows. When the old sparrow read this passage, it was extremely happy, and it immediately told its companions this good news. The sparrows truly "hopped for joy." They finally found their free world, their paradise!

    麻雀的天堂（拟童话）
    崔奇
    1958年的春天，中国开始了一场历史上从来没有过的战争：六亿人民向麻雀宣战，要把这些害鸟从中国的土地上全部消灭。中国人民可不是说空话的；他们说到做到，而且，做的照例比说的还要多，还要好。从城市到乡村，整个中国布下了天罗地网，麻雀们真是有翅难飞。它们的末日来临了。
    这时候，有一群麻雀，逃到一座森林里来。可是，它们马上发现那里也不是安全的地方。这可怎么办？麻雀们七嘴八舌地讨论起来。一只年纪最老的麻雀想出了一个办法。它大声说：“我建议搬家！”
    “搬到哪里去呢？”年轻的麻雀们一齐问。
    “孩子们，我从报纸上看到，有一个叫做美国的地方，那里的政府对中国人民是敌视的，而对美国人民的生活又是漠不关心的，如果我们搬到那里去，也许还可以过好日子。”
    “可是那个国家在什么地方呢？”
    “听说就在海的那边。”
    于是，这一群麻雀一致决议：搬到海的那边去！
    它们飞呀飞，飞过大洋，终于飞到了美国的上空。下边是一片茂盛的庄稼。
    “你们看，这里的庄稼倒是同中国的差不多呢。”一只麻雀说。
    它们继续向前飞，发现一些奇怪的光景。有许多田地用木板围起来，里边长满了荒草。还有不少田地上插着木牌，木牌上写着：这里要开辟大草原……。
    “这是怎么回事？”年轻的麻雀们实在不懂。
    老麻雀告诉它们说：“这是美国政府的命令，要减少耕地面积，有人曾经建议破坏一千万公顷耕地，让它撩荒着，变为草原。”
    “为什么呢？”
    “为什么？据说是因为粮食过剩了，所以政府告诉农民不要再种那么些地了。”
    “啊，好地方，粮食吃不完……。”
    “不是吃不完，是过剩！”老麻雀纠正说。“现在美国有成百万的人失业，有上千万的家庭还买不起足够的食物。至于农民，他们的日子也是不好过。”
    “这样说来，我们到这里来，岂不是要挨饿吗？”这个问题真的使麻雀们发起愁来了。
    它们怀着渺茫的心情继续向前飞。下边出现一座大城市。
    老麻雀心里想：如果能弄张报纸来看看就好了。果然，它们拾到了一张“芝加哥每日论坛报”。虽然这张报纸已经旧得发黄了，可是说来也凑巧，那上边恰好有一篇关于中国麻雀的社论，并没有过时。下边就是这篇社论中的一段话：
    “美国政府也许可以同共产党中国作一笔对双方都有利的交易。共产党不要把麻雀消灭掉，而把它们捕捉后活活送给我们。然后可以把这些麻雀放出，以便让它们去处理（！）美国的剩余农产品。它们在田里吃掉每一穗谷物，都将有助于减少政府必须以补助价格收买然后再以相当大的费用储存起来的农产品的吨数……。”（注）
    这简直就是美国对中国麻雀的一段欢迎词。当老麻雀读到这一段话时，快乐极了，它马上把这个福音告诉给同伴们，麻雀们真是“雀跃”起来了。它们终于找到了自己的自由世界，找到了自己的天堂！
