　　Another Innovation in Late Rice Seedling Cultivation: Floating Seedling Cultivation

　　This newspaper reports that the Luzhou County Agricultural Experiment Station in Sichuan Province has created a floating seedling cultivation method that neither occupies land nor requires much labor.

　　The method of floating seedling cultivation is as follows: rafts are made of bamboo or wood and floated on the surface of ponds, ditches, or rivers. The rafts are padded with about one inch of green grass or wheat straw, and then three inches of soil mixed with fertilizer is placed on top. Late rice seeds are then scattered on top. The soil layer on the raft should be about one-tenth of an inch thick, and its pressure should cause the raft to be submerged in water, making it easier for the late rice seeds to absorb moisture. There are three major benefits to using this method for seedling cultivation: first, it does not occupy cultivated land; second, it does not require irrigation, saving labor compared to aerial seedling cultivation; and third, the seedling roots stop growing after penetrating the soil layer, which can control seedling growth and is perfect for cultivating strong and healthy seedlings.

　　The staff of the station were inspired after seeing the aerial seedling cultivation method in Pixian County, and then came up with this clever method. After conducting two trials, the results were very good. The responsible comrades of the Luzhou Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the county committees attach great importance to the floating seedling cultivation method and have decided to make full use of all the water surfaces in the entire special zone that can be used for seedling cultivation.

### 晚稻育秧又一创举——水上育秧

　　晚稻育秧又一创举——水上育秧
    本报讯　四川泸县农业试验站创造了一种既不占地、又省劳力的水上育秧法。
    水上育秧的做法是：用竹子或木料扎成筏子，浮在塘堰、沟渠、河流的水面上，筏上垫一寸许青草或麦秆草，上放三寸厚的用肥料拌合好了的泥土，然后撒上晚稻种，筏子上要有一分厚左右的土层，借其压力，使筏子浸在水中，便于晚稻种吸收水分。用这个方法育秧有三大好处：第一不占耕地；第二不必?水，比起空中育秧法节省劳力；第三秧根穿过土层后就不长了，可以控制秧苗生长，正合培育老健秧的要求。
    该站职工是在看到郫县的空中育秧法后得到启发，才想出这个窍门的。经试做了两处，效果很好。中共泸州地委和各县委的负责同志对水上育秧法很重视。决定把全专区能够用来育秧的水面都充分利用起来。
