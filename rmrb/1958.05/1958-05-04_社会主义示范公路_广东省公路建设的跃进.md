    Socialist Demonstration Highway
    —A Leap Forward in Guangdong's Highway Construction
    “One road, two rivers, six rows of trees, eucalyptus, sunflowers, lychees, bananas, fish, good for fertilizer accumulation and irrigation, beneficial to both agriculture and forestry, beautiful scenery.” This is a new measure in Guangdong Province to comprehensively utilize the waste land on both sides of highways, further enhance the potential of highways, and build them into veritable "socialist roads" centered on highways.
    This measure requires the road surface to be built ten meters wide, straight, and level, with greenery on both sides of the road. Beside the trees, using the soil borrowing ditches, a small river six meters wide and more than one meter deep that can accommodate small boats is constructed according to different horizontal lines. On the opposite bank of the two rivers, there is also a six-meter-wide footpath with two rows of fruit trees and scenic trees planted. Fish are raised in the river to accumulate fertilizer and aquatic plants are grown. Where there are uneven areas, terraced rivers are used, turning the highway into a canal.
    Such a highway has been built for more than fifty kilometers near Siqian Town in Xinhui County (a section of the Guangzhou-Zhanjiang City highway), truly achieving a socialist road that is green, beautiful, economical, and canalized. The picture below shows a section of the highway. (Image attached)

    社会主义示范公路
    ——广东省公路建设的跃进
    “一路、两河、六行树，桉、葵、荔枝、香蕉、鱼，积肥排灌好便利，农林两利风景美。”这是广东省综合利用公路两旁废地、进一步发挥公路潜力，以公路为中心，修成名副其实的“社会主义之路”的一个新措施。
    这个措施要求公路面修成十公尺宽，直直的，平平的，路的两旁绿化。树的两旁利用取土沟，按照不同的水平线，修成一条六公尺宽、一公尺多深的能够通行小艇的小河。两河对岸还有六公尺宽的便道，各种上两行果树和风景树。河里养鱼积肥和种水生植物。遇高低不平的地方采用梯级河，成为公路运河化。
    这样的公路已在新会县司前镇附近五十多公里修筑起来（广州至湛江市公路干线的一段），真正做到了绿化、美化和经济化、运河化的社会主义之路。下图为公路的一段。（附图片）
