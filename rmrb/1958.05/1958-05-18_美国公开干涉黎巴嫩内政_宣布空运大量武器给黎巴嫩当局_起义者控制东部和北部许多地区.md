Xinhua News Agency dispatch on the 17th: The United States government is taking further actions to openly interfere in Lebanon's internal affairs. A U.S. State Department spokesman officially announced on the 16th that, in addition to airlifting so-called "police equipment," including rifles, machine guns, and tear gas, to the Lebanese government, the United States will also immediately ship tanks and other military equipment to the Lebanese government.

Upon hearing this news, all opposition parties immediately wrote to the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, warning him of the "serious consequences of intervention."

According to reports from Damascus newspapers on the 17th, Lebanese Army Commander-in-Chief General Shehab held a one-hour meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon on the 16th. Before meeting with the U.S. Ambassador, Shehab had held a series of contacts with opposition parties and government officials. It is said that these contacts were to discuss the formation of a new government composed of "neutral figures." Newspapers said that the U.S. Ambassador also held talks with President Chamoun.

Damascus newspapers and radio stations reported that conflicts between the people and security forces continue in many parts of Lebanon. So far, approximately one hundred people have died and several hundred have been injured in the week's clashes.

Sources say that Tripoli in northern Lebanon, Baalbek in the east, and Shouf in the center are all under the control of the insurgents. At the same time, the insurgents have also seized control of the Zgharta region in the north and have linked up with the insurgents in Tripoli.

In the Beit ed-Dine district, fierce fighting broke out between Druze insurgent forces and security forces. It is reported that an insurgent force of over a thousand people is rushing from the Beqaa Governorate to aid the insurgents in the Beit ed-Dine district.

Sources say that the bridge connecting Hasbaya and Tyre has been blown up, and traffic has been cut off.

According to Damascus Radio's broadcast early on the morning of the 17th, the Lebanese newspapers "Al-Siyassa," "Beirut Al Massa," and "Al-Jarida," as well as Egyptian newspapers, were confiscated by the Lebanese authorities on the 16th. Sources say that the government has also issued arrest warrants for the president of the opposition party's "Al Kifah" newspaper.
