Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, May 15th: After being cursed and beaten everywhere, U.S. Vice President Nixon cut short his visit to Latin American countries by one day. On the 14th, he left Caracas, the capital of Venezuela, bearing the contempt and curses of the Latin American people, and with a heavy heart, took a plane via Puerto Rico back to Washington.

During Nixon's one-day stay in Caracas, he cancelled all public appearances and remained in the U.S. Embassy residence like a prisoner all day. Outside the residence, dozens of armed military police were scattered around, and pedestrian traffic was prohibited beyond six hundred feet. Inside the residence, there were also dozens of secret service agents. Everyone entering the residence had to show identification. It is reported that Eisenhower also sent his own three bodyguards to strengthen Nixon's security.

On the road to the airport, the Venezuelan authorities took strict security measures. The entire eight-kilometer road was lined with police armed with machetes and tear gas, and all traffic along the way was prohibited. Nevertheless, Nixon did not dare to announce the exact time of his departure from the Venezuelan capital in advance.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 15th: The "New York Post," commenting on the results of Nixon's visit, wrote, "Nixon thought he could make up for the flaws [in U.S.-Latin American relations] with handshakes and smiles. However, this trick proved to be utterly useless."

The intensity of the anti-American sentiment displayed by Latin American countries during Nixon's visit was far beyond what the U.S. ruling circles had anticipated. The "Denver Post" wrote that the hostility of Latin American countries toward Nixon proves "the extent to which the United States' prestige has declined in some Latin American countries." The "Journal of Commerce" sadly said, "Relations between the United States and Latin American countries have now reached their lowest point in twenty-five years, and the barometer continues to fall."

    满载拉丁美洲人民的仇恨和唾骂
　　尼克松狼狈不堪提前回国
    美报惊呼美国在拉丁美洲威风扫地
    新华社15日讯　加拉加斯消息：在到处挨骂挨揍以后，美国副总统尼克松提前一天结束他对拉丁美洲国家的访问，在14日离开委内瑞拉首都加拉加斯，背负着拉丁美洲人民的唾弃和臭骂，心情沉重地乘飞机取道波多黎各回华盛顿。
    尼克松在加拉加斯的一天逗留期间，取消了一切参加公共场合的节目，形同囚犯地整天呆在美国大使馆官邸里。官邸外面，几十名荷枪持刀的宪兵散布在周围，六百英尺以外就禁止行人通行。官邸里面还有几十个特务人员。一切走进官邸的人，都必须出示身份证。据报道，艾森豪威尔还派了他自己的三个保镖去加强尼克松的警卫。
    在通往机场的道路上，委内瑞拉当局采取了严密的警戒措施。在整个八公里的道路两旁，布满了手持大刀和催泪弹的警察，而且沿途一切交通都被禁止了。尽管如此，尼克松还是没有敢事先宣布他离开委内瑞拉首都的确切时间。
    据新华社15日讯　华盛顿消息：“纽约邮报”在评论尼克松访问的结果时写道，“尼克松以为他能够用握手和笑容来弥补（美国和拉丁美洲国家关系的）缺陷。然而这种伎俩证明简直是徒劳无益”。
    拉丁美洲国家在尼克松访问期间所表现出来的反美情绪，其激烈程度是美国统治集团远远没有料想到的。“丹佛邮报”写道，拉丁美洲国家对尼克松的敌视证明“美国在某些拉丁美洲国家的威信已经下降到什么程度”。“商务日报”悲伤地说，“美国和拉丁美洲国家之间的关系现在已经达到了二十五年来的最低点，而且晴雨表还在继续下降中。”
