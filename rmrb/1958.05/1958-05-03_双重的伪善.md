Title: Double Hypocrisy

After the Soviet Union decided to unilaterally stop nuclear weapons testing, the United States still insisted on testing hydrogen bombs on Eniwetok Atoll. One of Eisenhower's excuses was that he was trying to produce "clean" nuclear weapons. After US Senator Anderson had already exposed this lie with the opposite fact, namely that the US military was trying to make the stored hydrogen bombs "dirtier" to increase their destructive power, Eisenhower continued to sing this platitude at a recent press conference, showing that he could no longer find any other excuses.

If you want to be clean, nothing is better than not testing or manufacturing such destructive weapons. To insist on testing and want to use the "clean" argument to deceive people, and to win a "humanitarian" reputation for yourself, is double hypocrisy!

    双重的伪善
    苏联决定单方面停止核武器试验之后，美国仍然坚持要在恩纳威托克岛试验氢弹。艾森豪威尔的借口之一是说为了试制“干净”的核武器。在美国参议员安德森已经用相反的事实，即美国军方正在设法把储存的氢弹弄得
  “更脏”以增加它们的破坏力，揭穿了这种谎言以后，艾森豪威尔在最近一次记者招待会上还继续弹唱这种滥调，可见他是再也找不到其他遁词了。
    要想干净，莫过于不试验、不制造这种毁灭性武器。既要坚持试验，又想用“干净”的说法来骗人，想为自己博得一个“人道”的名声，这是双重的伪善！
