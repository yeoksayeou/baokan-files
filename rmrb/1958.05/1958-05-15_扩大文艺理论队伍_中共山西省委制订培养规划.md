Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 14th: In view of the weakness of literary and art theory work in Shanxi Province in the past, the Propaganda Department of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the CPC has formulated a plan to vigorously cultivate literary and art theory cadres, requiring the training of thirty to fifty full-time literary and art theory cadres with considerable theoretical level and more than one hundred amateur literary and art theory cadres within five years.

The Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department plans to establish a "Literary and Art Theory Research Office" in the Provincial Federation of Literary and Art Circles and establish literary and art theory research groups in the Literary and Art Department of the Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department and the Cultural Department of the "Shanxi Daily". The tasks of the "Literary and Art Theory Research Office" are to study and research Marxist-Leninist literary and art theory, philosophical works, and the Party's literary and art policies; to study and comment on major issues in literary and artistic creation, literary and artistic thought, and literary and artistic work in the province, and to promote literary and art criticism and academic discussion; to carry out the struggle between the two lines on the literary and art front: it is necessary to criticize revisionist ideas and bourgeois literary and artistic viewpoints in the field of literature and art, but also to oppose dogmatism, adhere to and implement the policy of literature and art serving workers, peasants and soldiers, and promote and implement the creative method of combining socialist realism and revolutionary romanticism in order to promote the prosperity of the creative cause.

　　扩大文艺理论队伍
    中共山西省委制订培养规划
    新华社太原14日电　中共山西省委宣传部针对山西省过去文艺理论工作薄弱的状况，制订了大力培养文艺理论干部的规划，要求在五年内培养出具有相当理论水平的专职文艺理论干部三十至五十人、业余文艺理论干部一百多人。
    省委宣传部计划在省文联设立“文艺理论研究室”，在省委宣传部文艺处和“山西日报”文化部设立文艺理论研究组。“文艺理论研究室”的任务是学习和研究马列主义的文艺理论、哲学著作、党的文艺政策；研究和评论全省文艺创作、文艺思想、文艺工作中的重大问题，推动文艺批评和学术讨论；开展文艺战线上两条路线的斗争：既要批判文学艺术领域内的修正主义思想和资产阶级文艺观点，也要反对教条主义，坚持和贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方针，宣传和贯彻社会主义现实主义和革命的浪漫主义结合的创作方法，以推动创作事业的繁荣。
