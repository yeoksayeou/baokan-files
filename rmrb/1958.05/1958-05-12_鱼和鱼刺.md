　　Fish and Fish Bones
　　Ren Dan
　　Fish contains a lot of nutrients, but it also has a lot of bones. If you're not careful, you can easily get a bone stuck in your throat. When children eat fish, adults always say, "Be careful of the bones, don't get choked!"
　　I think classical literature is like this: it has nutrients, but it also has bones. But some of our classical literature teachers don't care much about students who haven't eaten "fish," and just keep praising, "This fish is so fresh, the taste is so delicious!" but don't remind students to pay attention to the "fish bones." As a result, many students get "fish bones" stuck in their throats. If you don't believe me, here are some examples: A student, when asked to teach at a spare-time school, said, "I won't bend my back for this little money!" This is obviously in the tone of Tao Yuanming. This kind of lofty thinking is really undesirable today. There are many similar examples. Take the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber," which everyone is familiar with, for example. It also has bones, and if you don't pay attention, you can get stuck by it.
　　This situation is of course related to the thinking of some students, but teachers also have an inescapable responsibility. Some teachers have deeply embedded "fish bones" in their throats without realizing it, and even let their students swallow the meat and bones together. I hope that these teachers will not only endure the pain of pulling out the "bones" from their throats, so as to prevent them from festering over time, but also help students, so that when students eat "fish," they must pick out the "bones" cleanly, so that they will not get choked, and can truly absorb the nutrients of the "fish."

### 鱼和鱼刺

　　鱼和鱼刺

    鱼含的养分很多，但是刺也很多。一不小心，就容易卡住喉咙。小孩在吃鱼时，大人总要说：“小心鱼刺，别卡着了！”
    我觉得古典文学也是这样：有养分，也有刺。可是我们有些古典文学教师却对没有吃过“鱼”的学生不太关心，只是一味称赞：“这鱼真鲜，味儿真美！”却不提醒学生注意“鱼刺”。于是，有不少学生被“鱼刺”卡住，不信，试举例子如下：有个学生，当别人要他教业余学校时，他却说：“我不为这点钱折腰！”这显然是陶渊明的口吻。这种清高思想，在今天来说，实在是要不得的。类似的例子还多得很。就以大家熟知的“红楼梦”这部小说来说，其中也有刺，如果不注意，也会被它卡住的。
    这种情况当然与有些学生的思想有关，但是，教师也有不容推卸的责任。有些教师，自己的喉咙里深深地扎进了“鱼刺”而不自觉，甚至让学生也连肉带刺一起往下吞了。我希望这些教师不但要忍痛把自己喉咙里的“刺”拔出来，以免时间长了化脓，而且也要帮助学生，让学生吃“鱼”时，一定要把“刺”挑得干干净净，不致卡住喉咙，而能真正吸收“鱼”的养分。
