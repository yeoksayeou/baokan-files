Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 23rd. The Korean National Peace Committee and the Korean Asian Solidarity Committee jointly held an enlarged meeting in Pyongyang on the 22nd.

The meeting issued an appeal to peace organizations and peace fighters all over the world, calling on them to condemn the US's fire-playing behavior and atrocities in South Korea and to support the Korean people's just struggle for the withdrawal of US troops from South Korea.

The appeal stated that the United States is undermining the Korean Armistice Agreement and is openly trying to turn South Korea into its atomic base. The United States and the Syngman Rhee clique are transporting various atomic weapons into South Korea and conducting "atomic war exercises" in South Korea. The appeal pointed out that the forcible occupation of South Korea by US troops is the root of all the misfortunes and disasters of the Korean people. In order to save the South Korean compatriots from this living hell and for the peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the Korean people once again emphasized their demand that US troops immediately withdraw from South Korea.
