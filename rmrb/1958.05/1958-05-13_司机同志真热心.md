　　Driver Comrade is Truly Enthusiastic
    On May 5th, before going to work, I went to a shoe repair stall to get my shoes nailed, and suddenly discovered that my wallet was lost. It also contained food coupons, meal tickets, cloth coupons, and a hospital registration card. I was very anxious and quickly went to the police station to report the loss, thinking that it probably couldn't be found. Unexpectedly, not long after I got to work, the comrades in the reception room called me and said that someone had brought me something. I went to the gate and saw a young comrade I didn't recognize. He asked me, "Did you lose something on the bus?" I replied that I had lost a wallet with such and such things inside. The comrade smiled and said, "If we hadn't seen the meal ticket and hospital registration card, we wouldn't have known it was yours. According to the old rules, we would have just handed it over to the company. But we thought that everyone is in the Great Leap Forward now and is very busy, so we took the opportunity after work to bring it to you, saving you the time and trouble of going yourself." I was deeply moved by this comrade's enthusiasm. I shook his hand vigorously for a long time and learned that his surname was Dong. Later, I went to the bus company to inquire and found out that this comrade was Dong Zhenting, the driver of bus number 85 on route 13, and the conductor who was on duty with him that day was named Li Bentang.

　　司机同志真热心
    5月5日，我在上班以前到修鞋摊上去钉鞋，忽然发现钱包丢了。里面还装有面票、饭票、布票、医院的挂号证等等东西。我很着急，赶快到派出所去挂失，心想大概是找不回来了。不料，上班后不久，忽然传达室的同志打电话叫我，说有人给我送东西来了。我到大门口一看，是一位不相识的青年同志。他问我：“您在公共汽车上丢东西了吧？”我答说丢了一个钱包，里边装了什么什么东西。这位同志笑着说：“要不是看见饭票和医院挂号证，还不知道是您丢的呢。按照老规矩，我们本来交给公司就行了。可是，我们想，现在大家都在大跃进，工作都挺忙，就乘着下班的机会给您送来了，省得让您自己去，耽误时间。”这位同志的热心肠使我感动极了。我使劲同他握了半天手，问知他姓董。后来又到公共汽车公司去打听，原来这位同志叫董振廷，是十三路八十五号公共汽车的司机，那天和他一起出勤的售票员同志叫李本堂。
