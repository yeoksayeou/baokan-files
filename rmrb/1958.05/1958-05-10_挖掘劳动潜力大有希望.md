	There is great hope in tapping labor potential.
	This year, the summer grain crops of the Yuhuang Agricultural Cooperative in Fengdong Township, Xixiang County, are growing exceptionally well. The cooperative members have proposed to complete the summer harvest and summer planting tasks in 45 days, ten days earlier than last year, to ensure that summer grain is brought home and rice seedlings are planted in a timely manner. However, according to detailed calculations, the cooperative's current labor force is short by 12,693 workdays. The cooperative mobilized everyone to offer suggestions and strategies, and the following specific measures were proposed: In one day of intensive work, widen the small roads and switch from carrying loads by people to using wheelbarrows when transporting wheat, delivering fertilizer, and selling public grain; change from threshing with flails to using stone rollers; change from manual grinding to water-powered grinding; for bachelors and 30 households with few members, adopt the method of sharing meals with neighbors or providing meal tickets to reduce their cooking time; organize baby-sitting groups to relieve women of childcare burdens.
	The cooperative cadres and members were very happy after tapping the labor potential. They immediately organized the labor force into various specialized groups according to labor strength and skill level, and formulated detailed plans such as careful harvesting and threshing, bringing every grain home, applying sufficient base fertilizer, and rational close planting.

    挖掘劳动潜力大有希望
    西乡县丰东乡玉皇农业社今年夏粮长得格外好，社员提出要比去年提前十天，在四十五天内完成夏收和夏插任务，保证夏粮颗粒还家，稻秧适时插上。但根据详细计算，全社现有劳力与实际需工相差一万二千六百九十三个。这个社发动大家献策献计，大家共提出以下几项具体措施：突击一天，将小路加大，在运麦、送肥、交售公购粮时，改人担为鸡公车推；改槤枷打场为石滚碾；改人推磨为水推磨；单身汉和人少的三十户社员，采用和邻居搭锅吃饭和给饭票的办法来减少他们做饭时间；组织抱娃组，解决妇女拖累。
    该社把劳动潜力挖出后，社干社员非常高兴。他们马上把劳力按照劳动强弱和技术高低，编成各种专业组，并订出了细收细打、颗粒还家、施足底肥、合理密植等计划。（附图片）
