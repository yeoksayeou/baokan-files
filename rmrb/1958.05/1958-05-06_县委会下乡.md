    County Committee Goes to the Countryside
    Zhu Dunyuan
    Since the County Committee moved to our township, people from far and near call them capable leaders; some simply call them miracle workers. There are so many things they do, it's impossible to list them all at once. I'll start with a few.

    The Day They Arrived
    Some time ago, we only heard that the County Committee was coming to the countryside, but no one paid much attention. We thought they were busy and wouldn't necessarily come so soon. Even if they did, we'd surely receive a notice three days in advance. The County Committee moving? That's a big deal, requiring at least three large rubber-wheeled carts. Who knew they'd arrive, each carrying their bedding, without a sound? Our township was caught completely off guard. We even bought firecrackers we didn't get to set off, and pointlessly assigned a group of people to wait at the crossroads at night, wasting their effort. They were already working under the lanterns.

    What could we do? The Township Secretary immediately made a self-criticism to the County Secretary. The County Secretary laughed and said jokingly, "Don't worry, we'll settle this account in the autumn harvest."

    A New Barber Arrives
    A new barber has come to our township.

    Xiao Chunming, who lives in the east courtyard of my house, came back from work one evening and shaved his head clean in the blink of an eye. So convenient, no need to go to town for a haircut, how nice.

    To be fair, the haircut wasn't that good. The marks from the comb teeth were still visible, and the hair was uneven, but Xiao Chunming was very satisfied. He said angrily, "Eight cents, what more do you want?"

    True, eight cents, good or bad, at least his hair was cut off. The next day, I sent my eldest child to try it first.

    Wow, a long queue stretching half a li. I was picking manure in the northeast ditch and saw it from afar, but in a short while, the line had shortened considerably.

    Li Si, the manure picker, stared at me and asked, "Is there really a talent! Someone from the County Committee who knows how to cut hair."

    Mentioning the County Committee stunned me. Indeed, everyone was lined up at the County Committee's reception room door.

    I became anxious, hoping the sun would set soon.

    After work, my eldest child was waiting for me at the door, head shaved.

    I quickly asked, "Silly child, who cut your hair?"

    He gestured and said, "That person with the gray hair, Dad, he's really interesting, he kept asking me if it hurt."

    "Ah! That must be Minister Cai from the Propaganda Department. Who else has gray hair?" After my child finished speaking, I immediately thought of him. But Minister Cai was injured before, and his right hand doesn't work well, how could he cut hair?

    The day before yesterday, Minister Cai brought a large sum of money to our township government, saying it should all be invested in our township's communes for the Great Leap Forward. Now, I understand, the new barber is indeed Minister Cai. I heard he didn't know how to cut hair before, it's all self-taught. Everyone is engaging in the Great Leap Forward in production, his body is inconvenient, but he's unwilling to fall behind, and finally seized on the barbering profession, painstakingly practicing to master it.

    A Basket of Manure
    The day after the County Committee came down, a township head came to the door, immediately complaining about difficulties. He said the township couldn't find manure sources, and couldn't guarantee 16,000 jin of manure per hectare. He was so anxious he was jumping up and down.

    The County Secretary was also there, but didn't immediately express an opinion. After the township head left, he asked a local to draw a map, carried a manure basket on his back, and chased after him.

    Corners, alleys, wall roots, tree sides, some potholes, the County Secretary walked all over them, looking for manure sources along the map. Before noon, the manure basket was full, filled with manure.

    The township head was sitting at his desk, worried, when a basket of manure was carried in. The County Secretary wasn't angry, he just said one sentence: "You can't lie down and Leap Forward!"

### 县委会下乡

    县委会下乡
    朱敦源
    自从县委会搬到咱们乡，远乡近村，都管他们叫干将，有的干脆喊他们神将。事情多着呢，一时说不完，我先挑几个谈谈。
    下乡的那天
    前些天，咱们光听到县委会要下乡，可是谁也没理会，总想忙不了，也不一定啥时候来，即使来，少不了前三天就接到通知，县委会?，搬家那是件大事，起码套上三辆大胶车。谁知道，人家背着铺盖，风不吹草不动的，一个个都下来了。咱乡可算全部抓瞎了，买的鞭炮也没有放，夜晚还瞎人摸火的调了一批人在路口等，这不是白搭功夫，人家早在灯笼火把底下活动开了。
    这怎么办呢？乡书记马上向县书记作了检讨，县书记哈哈一笑，半开玩笑的说：“不忙，这笔账，秋收一定要算清。”
    新来一个剃头的
    咱乡新来一个剃头的。
    我家东院小春明，晚上歇工回来，一刹眼就把头剃光了，这多方便，剃头也不用上城，真可心。
    公平点说，头是剃得不怎么好，轧刀上的齿耙子印还留着呢？头发长长短短，也没个看，可人家小春明却很满意，他气愤愤的说：“八分钱，你还要啥样？”
    真是，八分钱，管他好赖，总算把头发剃掉了。第二天，我打发大孩子先去试试。
    好家伙，一字长队排半里，我在东北沟挑粪，老远就看到，可是一阵功夫，队伍短了很多。
    挑粪的李四，瞪眼问我：“真有人才啊！县委会里还有会剃头的。”
    一提县委会，我就愕住了，可不，大伙都排在县委会的收发室门口。
    我着急了，老盼太阳快些落。
    下工了，大孩子光着头在门口等我。
    我赶紧问：“傻孩子，谁替你剃的。”
    他比手划脚的说开了。“那个长花白头发的人，爸，他真有意思，老问我痛不痛。”
    “呵！那一定是宣传部的蔡部长，要不，谁的头发还花白？”大孩子说完，我心里马上想到他，可是蔡部长早先受过伤，右手不是不好使？还能剃头？
    前天，蔡部长带着一大笔款项来咱乡政府，说要全部投给咱乡社里搞跃进。这下，我才明白过来，新来一个剃头的、那真正是蔡部长。听说早先他不会剃头，完全是现学现卖。大家都搞生产大跃进，他身体不便，可是又不甘心，终于抓住了剃头这一行，痛下苦心才练成的。
    一粪箕子大粪
    县委会下来第二天，有一个乡长找上门来了，一开口就是困难，乡里粪源找不到，一垧地一万六千斤粪保不了。进门就急得直跳。
    县书记也在，当场没有表示态度，等乡长一走，他找熟人画了一张地图，背上粪箕子，跟在屁股后边撵去了。
    角脚、胡同、墙根、树边、一些坑坑洼洼的地方，县书记高一脚低一脚都走遍了，沿着地图各处找粪源。不到晌午，粪箕子拣满了，拣的全是大粪。
    乡长坐在办公桌上发愁呢，一粪箕子大粪背来了。县书记没有生气，就说了一句话：“不能躺着跃进啊！”
