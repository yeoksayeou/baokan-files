What Does the Italian Election Result Show?
By Our Staff Commentator

The results of the Italian general election held on May 25th and 26th have been announced. Like the last election, the ruling Christian Democratic Party still did not win a majority in parliament, the Communist Party's vote increased, and the extreme right-wing neo-fascist party and the monarchist party suffered a disastrous defeat.

For a long time, the Italian Christian Democratic Party has been attempting to seize a majority in parliament by virtue of its ruling party status in order to establish a clerical dictatorship. In this election, it hoped to achieve this goal by using the support of monopoly capital, large landlords, and the open intervention of the church, but this hope was dashed. According to the election results, the Christian Democratic Party only received 41.2% of the votes in the Senate election. The number of seats it won in the House of Representatives was also more than twenty seats short of the necessary majority. Obviously, the Christian Democratic Party did not improve its position in this election. Not only could it not establish its clerical dictatorship, but it even had difficulty organizing a relatively stable government due to differences with other bourgeois parties.

The election results prove that the Italian Communist Party once again victoriously repelled the attack of the reactionaries and still maintained its position as the second largest party in the Italian Senate and House of Representatives.

Before this general election, the Italian ruling group had launched a frenzied attack on the Italian Communist Party, which resolutely defended Italian democracy, freedom, and national independence. They also used the wavering attitude of the Socialist Party's leadership to try to win over the Socialist Party in an attempt to isolate the Italian Communist Party. During the election campaign, the Christian Democratic Party government even unreasonably prohibited the Communist Party from using television and radio like other parties. However, the Communist Party's election platform was supported by the broad masses of people, and it received more than 500,000 more votes than in the last election. The Communist Party's influence among the masses has grown significantly. This fact powerfully shattered the slander that the Italian Communist Party was facing a crisis.

In this election, the fascist forces in Italy, encouraged by the French fascist crisis, had been extremely rampant. They thought their chance to make a comeback had come. However, the Italian people, who had suffered the disasters of fascist rule, resolutely rejected the fascist forces. The neo-fascist party and the two monarchist parties lost a large number of votes in this House of Representatives election, and their seats were greatly reduced. This situation shows that the people do not allow fascism to raise its head.

The results of the Italian election show that the bourgeoisie's attempt to use anti-communism as a means to consolidate their rule is bound to fail. In today's era, more and more people in all countries recognize that the Communist Party represents the interests and hopes of the people.

    意大利大选的结果说明什么
    本报评论员
     5月25日、26日举行的意大利大选的结果已经揭晓。像上次大选一样，执政党天主教民主党在议会中仍然没有赢得多数，共产党的选票增加了，而极右翼的新法西斯党和保皇党则遭到了惨重的失败。
    长期以来，意大利天主教民主党一直凭借它的执政党地位，企图攫取议会里的多数，来建立教权独裁统治。在这次大选中，它指望利用垄断资本、大地主的支持和教会的公开干涉，来达到这个目的，但是这个指望落空了。选举的结果，天主教民主党在参议院选举中只得到了41.2％的选票。它在众议院所取得的席位也比必要的多数少二十多席。显然，天主教民主党在这次大选中并没有改善它的地位。它不但不能建立它的教权独裁统治，甚至由于同其他资产阶级政党的分歧，它想组织一个比较稳定的政府都有困难。
    这次选举结果证明，意大利共产党又一次胜利地击退了反动派的进攻，仍然保持了在意大利参众两院中第二大党的地位。
    在这次大选前，意大利的统治集团曾经对坚决捍卫意大利民主、自由和民族独立的意大利共产党进行了疯狂的攻击。它们还利用社会党领导集团的动摇态度，竭力拉拢社会党以图孤立意大利共产党。在竞选运动中，天主教民主党政府更无理地禁止共产党像其他政党一样使用电视、无线电。但是，共产党的竞选主张，得到了广大群众的拥护，它所得到的选票比上次大选多了五十多万张。共产党在群众中的影响有了显著地增长。这个事实有力地粉碎了所谓意大利共产党面临着危机的谰言。
    在这次大选中，意大利的法西斯势力，由于得到法国法西斯危机的鼓舞，曾表现得极为猖狂。他们以为他们卷土重来的机会来了。但是，曾经遭受过法西斯统治的灾难的意大利人民，坚决地唾弃了法西斯势力。新法西斯党和两个保皇党在这次众议院的选举中，丧失了大量的选票，议席也大大减少。这种情形表明，人民是不许法西斯抬头的。
    意大利大选的结果表明，资产阶级企图用反共作为巩固他们的统治的手段，这种打算是必然要失败的。在今天的时代里，各国人民群众中越来越多的人认识到，共产党代表着人民的利益和希望。
