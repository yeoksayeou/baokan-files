Yunnan, May 29th (Reporter Guo Longchun, Zhang Jiecun) – The Yuxi Prefecture Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province mobilized the masses to refute the various erroneous arguments of the "skeptics" inside and outside the Party against drought resistance and rice transplanting, and insisted on transplanting rice seedlings ahead of schedule, achieving a decisive victory.

The rainy season in Yunnan this year generally arrived more than a month later than in previous years. Should we use drought-resistant methods to plant ahead of schedule according to plan, or postpone planting and wait for the rain? This was the key issue for whether grain production could be increased this year, and also the focus of the struggle between the revolutionary faction and the "skeptical faction" among cadres in the Yuxi area since early May. The revolutionary faction, which constitutes the vast majority of cadres, saw both the difficulties of the drought and the favorable conditions such as the unprecedentedly high enthusiasm of the peasant masses, the great achievements in water conservancy projects, and the abundance of underground water sources. They also saw the favorable factors in the difficulties: hot and humid soil in dry weather, sufficient sunshine, and especially fast seedling growth. They believed that as long as the masses were mobilized, sufficient effort was exerted, and efforts were made to move upstream, the difficulties of drought resistance and seedling protection could definitely be overcome. Planting the seedlings early would allow full use of the favorable factors before the arrival of the rainy season, laying a favorable foundation for high yields. A few "skeptics" who did not believe in the masses and originally lacked confidence in the great leap in agriculture were frightened by the difficulties. They believed that "it is impossible to plant seedlings early due to drought, little water, and tight labor," and "planting seedlings for drought resistance will only lead to them being scorched to death; it is better to wait for the rain to come before planting." In their view, increasing production this year was hopeless; rather than taking the risk of a large-scale reduction in production by planting for drought resistance, it would be better to honestly "rely on the heavens for food."

In response to this situation, the Yuxi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized cadres and masses throughout the prefecture to conduct debates. By calculating four accounts, the vast number of cadres and masses realized that it was both necessary and feasible to plant early for drought resistance. In the process of calculating accounts of increased production and seasonal accounts, various places cited a large number of facts to illustrate that advancing one solar term could generally increase rice production by one hundred catties. By calculating water conservancy accounts and manpower and animal power accounts, various places generally believed that as long as sufficient effort was exerted and more methods were devised, the drought could be overcome and planting could be fully carried out. These facts powerfully shattered the pessimistic arguments of the "skeptics" and educated the vast number of cadres and masses. Individual county, district, and township leading cadres with serious right-leaning thoughts who stubbornly "resisted planting but not drought resistance" have been ordered by higher leading organs to suspend their duties and reflect.

Hundreds of thousands of people in the drought resistance army were mobilized, with the heroic spirit of "making a great disturbance in the Crystal Palace and enraging the Dragon King" and "making the river water flow backwards and the lake water climb mountains," bravely advancing towards drought resistance and planting. Qilu County mobilized more than 20,000 people and more than 15,000 waterwheels to form an eight-way army to intercept lake water and groundwater to irrigate the fields. The masses in Eshan Yi Autonomous County quickly found more than 3,000 underground water sources. The masses in mountainous townships such as Nuozu and Lufeng in Huaning County, together with more than 2,000 shock workers sent by the county party committee, installed 1,000 waterwheels to pump the water from the Pan River and pour it into the terraced fields four miles away. The progress of rice transplanting throughout the prefecture has increased from 20,000 mu per day to 40,000 mu, 42% higher than the highest daily progress last year. It is expected that most of the seedlings can be planted before Mangzhong (Grain in Ear), two solar terms earlier than in previous years and seven or eight days earlier than last year.

At present, the rice fields in various counties are lush green, and most of the planted seedlings are growing very vigorously.

    云南玉溪专区通过大辩论驳倒“怀疑派”
    提早两个节令抗旱栽秧
    本报云南29日电　记者郭龙春、章皆淳报道：云南省玉溪专区各级党委发动群众，驳倒党内外“怀疑派”对抗旱栽秧的各种错误论调，坚持提早节令栽插秧苗，已经取得决定性的胜利。
    云南各地今年的雨季一般都比往年迟来一个多月。是用抗旱的办法按计划提前栽种，还是推迟季节等雨栽秧？这是今年粮食能否增产的关键问题，也是5月上旬以来玉溪地区干部当中革命派同“怀疑派”斗争的焦点。在干部中占绝大多数的革命派，既看到了干旱的困难，又看到了农民群众积极性空前高涨、水利工程成绩巨大、地下水源丰富等有利条件。他们还看到了困难中的有利因素：旱天土热、水热，阳光充足，秧苗生长特别快。他们认为：只要发动群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，抗旱、保苗的困难一定能够克服。提前把秧栽下去，便可以充分利用雨季到来以前的有利因素，为丰产打下有利的基础。少数不相信群众，原来对农业大跃进就缺乏信心的“怀疑派”被困难吓倒了。他们认为：“天旱水少劳力紧，提前栽秧办不到”，“抗旱栽下也是晒死，不如等雨来了再栽”……在他们看来，今年增产已经无望，与其抗旱栽秧冒大减产的危险，倒不如老老实实“靠天吃饭”。
    针对这种情况，中共玉溪地委组织全专区干部、群众开展了辩论。通过算四笔账，使广大干部、群众认识到抗旱提早插秧十分必要，而且条件具备。各地在算增产账和节令账的过程中，举出大量事实说明：提早一个节令，一般可以增产一百斤稻谷。各地通过算水利账和人力、畜力账，普遍认为只要鼓足干劲，多想办法，就可以战胜干旱满栽满插。这些事实有力地粉碎了“怀疑派”的悲观论调，使广大干部、群众受到了教育。个别右倾思想严重、顽固“抗栽不抗旱”的县、区、乡领导干部，上级领导机关已经责令他们停职反省。
    几十万人的抗旱大军行动起来了，以“大闹水晶宫，气死老龙王”、“让河水倒流、让湖水上山”的英雄气概，向抗旱栽种勇猛进军。杞麓县出动了两万多人，一万五千多张水车，组成八路大军，截湖水、地下水灌田。峨山彝族自治县群众很快找到了三千多处地下水。华宁县糯祖、禄丰等山区乡的群众，同县委派来的两千多名突击队员一起，安上一千张水车，把盘江的水抽上来，倒灌到四里以外的梯田里。全专区插秧进度由过去的每天两万亩提高到四万亩，比去年最高日进度高42％。预计芒种以前，绝大部分秧苗可以栽下，比往年提早两个多节令，比去年提早七、八天。
    目前，各县稻田正是一片油绿，已栽下的秧苗绝大部分都生长得十分茁壮。
