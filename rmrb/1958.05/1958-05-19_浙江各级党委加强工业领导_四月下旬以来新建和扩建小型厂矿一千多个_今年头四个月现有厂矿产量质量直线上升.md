Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, 17th: Since late April, Zhejiang Province has put into production 1,245 newly built and expanded small factories and mines, including machinery factories, fertilizer plants, hydropower stations, biogas power stations, and cement plants.

To adapt to this new situation of the great development of local industry, Party committees at all levels in Zhejiang Province have strengthened their leadership over industry. More than 2,000 cadres have been transferred to strengthen the industrial front, and industrial management organizations at all levels have been established and improved. Jiang Hua, First Secretary of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee, has focused his leadership on industry. The Provincial Party Committee has assigned Wu Xian and Chen Weida, members of the Standing Committee and Vice Governors, to be specifically responsible for leading industrial construction. Of the province's 79 counties, 64 county party secretaries and deputy secretaries, and 15 members of the Standing Committee and members of the county party committee are specifically responsible for grasping industry. All counties have established industrial basic construction committees or industrial offices. Townships and communes have also established industrial construction guidance committees and industrial leading groups, and have designated one of the township/commune general branch secretaries or deputy secretaries to lead industry. The industrial leading groups in many townships and communes have also improved their working systems and reporting systems.

In developing local industry, Zhejiang Province has implemented the spirit of self-reliance, starting from scratch, and running industry diligently and thriftily. The factories run by various localities make full use of existing buildings, from simple to complete, from small to large. Due to the close reliance on the masses to run industry, 75.39 million yuan of funds have now been raised throughout the province. The masses not only contribute money and labor, but also search for industrial raw materials everywhere. For example, the masses in Wenling County have found a variety of minerals such as pyrite, coal, oil shale, peat, alum, limestone, copper, manganese, and graphite.

Hangzhou, 18th: Production in Zhejiang's factories and mines has risen sharply after eight months of rectification. According to statistics for January to April this year, the output value completed was 718 million yuan, of which the total output value completed in April was 208 million yuan, an increase of 42% over the same period last year.

Since the beginning of this year, workers in Zhejiang's factories and mines have made remarkable achievements in improving product quality, using substitutes, and saving raw materials. By the end of March, the quality of 42 products in the province had reached or exceeded international standards, the quality of 76 products had reached or exceeded advanced domestic levels, and more than 900 new products were being trial-produced or had already been put into production. From March 18 to May 6, factories and mines used 152 substitutes, greatly saving raw materials. For example, Kaihua Oil Extraction Factory collected 32 kinds of wild plants and recently used bayberry kernel to extract oil. Each 100 jin of bayberry kernel can extract 6 jin of oil. The oil is of excellent quality and can be used for consumption. Jiaxing Winery uses Poria cocos and Rosa laevigata to make wine. Each 100 jin of Poria cocos can produce 50 jin of wine, and each 100 jin of Rosa laevigata can produce about 40 jin of wine.

In technical innovation, the broad masses of workers dared to think and dared to act, creating many miracles. Workers at the Zhejiang Pharmaceutical Factory conducted more than 30 experiments on digitalis toxin, and its quality quickly surpassed that of the United Kingdom. Hangzhou artificial silk brocade has eliminated the "white dew" on the satin surface through refined formula, operation, and the use of pressed stearin, and its quality has surpassed that of Japan. Ningbo Heping Yarn Factory successfully tried to spin yarn directly from the first coarse yarn, shortening the process, reducing the yarn breakage rate, and improving the yarn evenness. The electric walking plow made by Quzhou Machinery Repair Factory can plow 60 meters per minute, with a deep tillage of nine inches. Jiaxing County Fan and Wood Cooperative has produced a "universal boat," which is equipped with a diesel engine that can drive a water pump to pump water, and a modified motorized mud kneading machine can knead river mud; the stern has a propeller for propulsion, which can be used as a motorized boat. These technical innovations and creations have played a significant role in the current industrial and agricultural production of the province. (Liu Fan)

　　浙江各级党委加强工业领导
　　四月下旬以来新建和扩建小型厂矿一千多个
    今年头四个月现有厂矿产量质量直线上升
    新华社杭州17日电　浙江省从4月下旬以来，已经有新建和扩建的机械厂、化肥厂、水电站、沼气电站、水泥厂等一千二百四十五个小型厂矿投入生产。
    适应地方工业大发展的这种新形势，浙江省各级党委都加强了对工业的领导。全省已抽调两千多个干部加强工业战线，建立和健全了各级工业管理机构。中共浙江省委第一书记江华，已经把领导重点放在工业方面。省委分工由常委、副省长吴宪、陈伟达专门负责领导工业建设。全省七十九个县，有六十四个县委书记、副书记，十五个县委常委和委员分工专门抓工业。各县都成立了工业基本建设委员会或工业办公室等。各乡、镇、社也建立了工业建设指导委员会、工业领导小组，并确定乡、镇的总支书记或副书记一人领导工业。许多乡、镇、社的工业领导小组还健全了工作制度和汇报制度。
    浙江省在发展地方工业中，贯彻了自力更生，白手起家，勤俭办工业的精神。各地办的工厂充分利用现有的房屋，由简陋到完备，由小到大。由于紧密地依靠群众办工业，现在全省已筹集资金七千五百三十九万元。群众不仅出钱、出力，而且还四出寻找工业原料。如温岭县群众就找到了黄铁矿、煤、油页岩、泥炭、矾、石灰石、铜、锰、石墨等等多种矿藏。
    本报杭州18日电　经过八个月整风运动的浙江厂矿企业生产直线上升。据今年1至4月份统计，已完成产值七点一八亿元，其中4月份完成的总产值二点零八亿元，比去年同期增长42％。
    今年以来，浙江厂矿企业的职工们，在提高产品质量，使用代用品，节约原材料等方面，都作出了显著的成绩。到3月底止，全省已有四十二种产品质量赶上或超过国际标准，有七十六种产品质量赶上或超过国内先进水平，有九百多种新产品正在试制或已经投入生产。从3月18日到5月6日，厂矿企业使用了代用品一百五十二件，大大地节约了原材料。如开化榨油厂采集了三十二种野生植物，最近利用杨梅核仁榨油，每百斤杨梅核可榨油六斤，油质优良，可供食用。加兴酒厂用茯苓和金英子制酒，每百斤茯苓能出酒五十斤，每百斤金英子能出酒四十斤左右。
    在技术革新中，广大职工敢想、敢干，创造了许多奇迹。浙江制药厂职工对毛地黄毒?进行了三十多次的试验，使其质量迅速地超过英国。杭州人造丝织锦缎，经过精制配方、操作和利用了压硬脂等措施，消灭了缎面“白露”，质量已超过日本。宁波市和平纱厂试用头道粗纱直接纺纱成功，缩短了工艺过程，又降低了断头率和提高了纱支匀度。衢州机械修配厂制成的电动步犁，每分钟能耕六十公尺，深耕九寸。嘉兴县风机木业社制出“万能船”，船上装上柴油机可带动水泵抽水，改装机动捻泥机，可以捻河泥；船尾有螺旋桨推进器，可作机动船。这些技术革新和创造已经在全省当前的工农业生产中起了显著作用。　（刘凡）
