The 2.3 million-strong labor force in Changde and Xiangtan Special Districts of Hunan Province is waging a tenacious struggle against the recent waterlogging and flash floods with an overwhelming heroic spirit.

Since the beginning of May, Hunan Province has experienced continuous rainfall, with rainfall more than double that of the same period last year. More than one million mu of farmland in lakeside counties have been waterlogged; in the hilly areas of Xiangtan Special District, some reservoirs, ponds, and farmland have also been impacted by flash floods; the Xiang, Zi, Yuan, and Li Rivers have risen successively, and the flood situation is tense in some areas.

In the lakeside counties, 900,000 young and middle-aged people have been fully engaged in flood prevention and waterlogging drainage, with more than 70,000 waterwheels and a large number of water pumps running day and night to drain water. Among the more than one million mu of affected farmland, 600,000 mu have already been drained of water. In Xiangtan Special District, 1.4 million farmers are fighting floods day and night. This special district has repaired 57 reservoirs and more than 800 ponds by May 7.

In the struggle against natural disasters, many townships and communes have highly developed the spirit of socialist cooperation and mutual support. Shoujian Township in Yuanjiang County, which was not affected by waterlogging, sent labor and transported water pumps to nearby Xinhua Township to help drain waterlogging.

Currently, the province is still experiencing continuous rainfall. Local leading organs are further mobilizing the masses, organizing labor, and preparing materials to strive again and resolutely conquer the flood. (Gao Changren)

　　再接再厉战胜洪水
    湖南省常德、湘潭两专区的二百三十万劳动大军，正以排山倒海的英雄气概，向最近发生的渍水和山洪作顽强斗争。
    湖南省自5月初就连续降雨，雨量比去年同期增加了一倍以上，滨湖各县有一百多万亩田渍水；湘潭专区的丘陵地带，也有一些水库、水塘、农田受到山洪的冲击；湘、资、沅、澧水相继上涨，部分地区汛情紧张。
    滨湖各县全力投入防汛、排渍的青壮年已有九十万人，每天有七万多部水车和大批抽水机日夜转动排水。在一百多万亩受渍田中，已排出六十万亩的渍水，湘潭专区有一百四十万农民不分日夜和洪水进行战斗。这个专区已在5月7日修复了五十七座水库和八百多口水塘。
    在向自然灾害进行斗争中，许多乡、社高度发挥了社会主义的协作精神，互相支援。沅江县没有受到渍水灾害的首建乡，派出劳动力和运送抽水机到附近的新华乡帮助排渍。
    目前全省仍是阴雨连绵，各地领导机关正进一步发动群众，组织劳力和准备物资，再接再厉坚决战胜洪水。　（高长任）
