Chairman Mao Inspects Dujiangyan Irrigation System
Ge Bizhou

The snow of the Qionglai Mountains, which has lasted for thousands of years,
The Min River flows for thousands of miles.
The forests of western Sichuan sway towards Qingcheng,
Chairman Mao inspects Dujiangyan Irrigation System.
The Erwang Temple stands before Jade Mountain,
White clouds, green mountains, and river waters sway.
The red sun shines upon Wangniang Shoal,
Auspicious purple clouds shroud the Couple's Bridge.
I see the Erwangs welcoming before the temple,
Banners fill Dujiangyan.
The Erwangs bow to our leader, bow to our Party,
The Three Mountains and Five Peaks pay homage to Kunlun Mountain.
Chairman Mao holds the universe in his hands,
The muddy Yellow River must be cleared.
What about Li Bing and his son controlling the Min River?
With the red sun in the sky, where can the stars be seen?

    毛主席巡视灌江口
    戈壁舟岷山千年雪，岷江万里流，西川林海荡青城，毛主席巡视灌江口。玉垒山前二王庙，白云青山江水摇，红日照着望娘滩，紫气笼住夫妻桥。我见二王迎庙前，旌旗飘满都江堰，二王拜咱领袖拜咱党，三山五岳朝拜昆仑山。毛主席两手握乾坤，浑浊的黄河要澄清；说啥李冰父子治岷水，红日当空哪还见星星。
