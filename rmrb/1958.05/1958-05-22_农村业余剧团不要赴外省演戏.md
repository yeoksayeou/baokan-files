    Rural Amateur Theaters Should Not Go to Other Provinces to Perform
    The rural amateur theater troupe of Tangzhuang Township, Jixian County, Henan Province, arrived in our county in March to perform, disregarding the busy farming season and the opportunity for a leap in production. The troupe also had a certificate from the township people's committee. We believe that rural amateur theater troupes should perform seasonally, and their usual activities should be to serve production and encourage production enthusiasm during slack farming and rest periods, and not to travel to distant places or other provinces like professional theater troupes.

    农村业余剧团不要赴外省演戏
    河南省汲县唐庄乡农村业余剧团不顾农忙季节与生产跃进的时机，于3月间到达我县演戏。剧团还持有乡人民委员会证明信。我们认为农村业余剧团是季节性演出，平时的活动也是农闲休息时间为生产服务和鼓励生产干劲，并不是像职业剧团一样可以赴远地或外省演出。
