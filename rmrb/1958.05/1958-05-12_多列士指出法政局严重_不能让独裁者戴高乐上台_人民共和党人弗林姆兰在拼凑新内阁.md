Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th: "Paris Radical News" published on the 9th the reply of Maurice Thorez, General Secretary of the French Communist Party, to a letter written to him and thirty-three prominent French political figures. In this letter, "Paris Radical News" asked the recipients for their opinions on the possibility of inviting General De Gaulle to form a cabinet.

In his reply, Thorez pointed out the seriousness of the current French political situation. He said that all the misfortunes of the country were not due to too much democracy, as some people were trying to claim, but to the destruction of democracy. Therefore, guaranteeing the stability of the government should not be sought in personal power and the adoption of extraordinary systems, but in implementing policies that conform to the will of all voters and implementing practical measures that conform to democracy.

Thorez said that letting General De Gaulle form a cabinet means going down a completely opposite road. De Gaulle's cronies have all shown that they are supporters of the most disastrous policies, such as supporting Soustelle, the leader of the extremists in Algeria. De Gaulle is one of those responsible for overthrowing the alliance and destroying the Franco-Soviet treaty he signed eleven years ago. De Gaulle also greatly praised the North Atlantic Treaty. In domestic affairs, De Gaulle's main target is the working people who support the cause of socialism. Thorez said that the French Communist Party cannot agree to a dictator as a candidate for prime minister.

Thorez pointed out that continuing the war in Algeria is the main reason for all the current difficulties in the French political situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, 10th: The French cabinet crisis has lasted for more than twenty days. After the successive failures of Piddault and Plevin, Flimlin of the People's Republican Party, who was invited to form a cabinet, informed the President on the evening of the 10th that he had accepted the mission of forming a cabinet.

Judging from Flimlin's cabinet program that has been revealed, the policies he plans to pursue on the Algerian issue and domestic political issues are no different from those of the outgoing Guy Mollet government and the policies drafted by Plevin, who just failed to form a cabinet. His three-point program includes: continuing the colonial war in Algeria, while preparing for ceasefire negotiations from a "position of strength" at a time of his own choosing, increasing new taxes in financial affairs, compressing domestic consumption, and freezing wages; while continuing to complete the so-called constitutional amendment to strengthen the power of the administrative organs.

Currently, Flimlin is running around trying to win support from the Socialist Party to the right-wing Independent Party, but judging from various signs, he has so far only received limited support. There are reports that Flimlin is preparing to organize a minority cabinet, and if necessary, even a cabinet based on the People's Republican Party alone. Naturally, even if such a cabinet is barely put together, it can only survive in the cracks, and it is destined to be another short-lived cabinet.

### 多列士指出法政局严重　不能让独裁者戴高乐上台  人民共和党人弗林姆兰在拼凑新内阁

    多列士指出法政局严重
　　不能让独裁者戴高乐上台
    人民共和党人弗林姆兰在拼凑新内阁
    据新华社巴黎10日电　“巴黎激进新闻”9日刊载了法国共产党总书记多列士对这家报纸写给他以及三十三个法国著名的政治活动家的信件的答复。“巴黎激进新闻”在这封信里面要求受信人对可能请戴高乐将军组阁一事发表意见。
    多列士在答复中指出了当前法国政局的严重性。他说，当前国家的一切不幸并不是如某些人所力图说明的那样由于民主过多，而是由于破坏了民主。因此，保证政府的稳定不能在个人权力和采用非常制度方面去寻求，而是要实行符合全体选民意志的政策，实行符合民主的实际措施。
    多列士说，让戴高乐将军来组阁意味着走上完全相反的道路。戴高乐的亲信们都表明他们是最灾难性的政策的支持者，例如他们支持在阿尔及利亚的过激分子头子苏斯戴尔。戴高乐是应对十一年前推翻联盟、破坏自己签订的法苏条约的负责人之一。戴高乐还大肆赞扬北大西洋公约。在内政方面，戴高乐的主要矛头指向拥护社会主义事业的劳动人士。多列士说，法国共产党不能同意由一个独裁者作总理候选人。
    多列士指出，继续在阿尔及利亚进行战争是当前法国政局一切困难的主要原因。
    据新华社巴黎10日电　法国内阁危机已经延续了二十多天。在皮杜尔和普利文相继失败后被邀请组阁的人民共和党的弗林姆兰10日晚通知总统，表示接受组阁的使命。
    从已经透露的弗林姆兰的组阁纲领看来，他在阿尔及利亚问题以及国内政治问题上准备奉行的政策同已经倒台的盖伊阿政府和刚刚组阁失败的普利文拟订的政策没有什么不同。他的三点纲领包括：继续在阿尔及利亚进行殖民战争，同时从“实力地位”出发，准备在它自己选择的时机来进行停火谈判，在财经方面将增收新税，压缩国内消费，冻结工资；同时要继续完成所谓修改宪法的行动，以加强行政机构的权力。
    目前弗林姆兰正在奔走活动，争取从社会党到右翼独立党的支持，但是从各方面迹象看来，他迄今只得到有限的支持。有消息说，弗林姆兰准备组织一个少数派的内阁，不得已时甚至只是以人民共和党一个党为基础的内阁。自然，这种内阁即使勉强拼凑成功，也只能在夹缝中生存，它注定会是又一个短命的内阁。
