Xinhua News Agency, May 4th: The military friendship delegation of the United Arab Republic, headed by Lieutenant General Muhammad Ibrahim, held a farewell banquet in Beijing tonight.

Vice Chairman Zhu De, Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and President of the Sino-Arab Friendship Association Bao Erhan were invited to attend the banquet.

Also invited to attend the banquet were: General Zhang Zongxun, General Xiao Hua, General Gan Siqi, General Yang Chengwu, General Guo Tianmin, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Air Force Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang, Air Force Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun, Navy Lieutenant General Luo Shun, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as Colonel Li Dazhong, the Chinese military attache to the United Arab Republic.

Charge d'Affaires ad interim Shebini of the Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China attended the banquet.

Head of the Delegation Ibrahim said at the banquet that China's support for the United Arab Republic, just as a free man supports another free man fighting against aggressors, has brought our two countries closer together, a relationship that we can clearly see in trade and politics.

Ibrahim said: We are paying attention to your leaders' call for peace and freedom. We have seen here the great achievements you have made in a short period of time after driving out imperialism; wherever we go, every Chinese person, whether soldier or civilian, has shown friendship and goodwill towards our country and our struggle. I hope that this visit will be the beginning of a sincere friendship between the armed forces of our two countries.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the delegation's visit to our country has played an important role in strengthening the mutual understanding and friendship between the people and armies of our two countries. I am convinced that on this basis, the friendship and unity between the people and armies of our two countries will be further consolidated and developed.

Marshal Peng Dehuai emphasized: Imperialist countries, especially American imperialism, have never relaxed their subversive activities and other aggressive conspiracies against Asian and African countries. At present, the United States is directly and through the Chiang Kai-shek clique aiding the Indonesian rebels, blatantly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. We Asian and African countries must maintain high vigilance and strengthen unity to repel all the conspiracies of imperialism. I am convinced that under the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind and the people of Asia and Africa have awakened, all the conspiracies of imperialism will not succeed.

Marshal Peng Dehuai finally said that the delegation will soon leave Beijing to return home, and we sincerely ask the delegation to convey the respect and friendship of the Chinese people to the people of the United Arab Republic.

Diplomatic envoys and military attachés of various countries in China were also invited to attend the banquet tonight.

    阿联军事友好访华团在京举行辞行宴会
    新华社4日讯　以穆罕默德·易卜拉欣中将为首的阿拉伯联合共和国军事友好访华代表团，今天晚上在北京举行辞行宴会。
    朱德副主席、周恩来总理和国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅、副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅、外交部副部长章汉夫、中阿友好协会会长包尔汉，应邀出席了宴会。
    应邀出席宴会的还有：张宗逊上将、萧华上将、甘泗淇上将、杨成武上将、郭天民上将、刘志坚中将、萧向荣中将、王秉璋空军中将、常乾坤空军中将、罗舜初海军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领和我国驻阿拉伯联合共和国武官李大中上校。
    阿拉伯联合共和国驻华大使馆临时代办谢宾尼，出席了宴会。
    易卜拉欣团长在宴会上讲话说，中国对阿拉伯联合共和国的支援，正如一个自由的人支援另一个正在与侵略者作斗争的自由的人一样，使我们两国关系更加接近，这种关系在贸易和政治上我们都可以清楚地看到。
    易卜拉欣团长说：我们注视着你们领导者关于争取和平和自由的号召。我们在这里看到了你们赶走帝国主义以后在短时期内获得的巨大成就；我们所到的地方，每个中国人，不论是军人或老百姓，对我们国家、我们的斗争所表现的友谊和善意。我希望这次访问是我们两国武装部队之间真挚友谊的开端。
    彭德怀元帅讲话说，代表团在我国的参观访问，对于加强我们两国人民和军队间的相互了解和友谊起了重要的作用。我深信：在这一基础上，我们两国人民和军队间的友谊和团结，将得到更进一步的巩固和发展。
    彭德怀元帅强调说：帝国主义国家，特别是美帝国主义，从来没有放松对亚非国家进行颠覆活动和其它侵略阴谋。目前，美国正在直接地并通过蒋介石集团援助印度尼西亚的叛乱分子，露骨地干涉印度尼西亚的内政。我们亚非各国必须保持高度的警惕，加紧团结，来打退帝国主义的一切阴谋。我深信：在东风压倒西风、亚非人民已经觉醒的形势下，帝国主义的一切阴谋是不可能得逞的。
    彭德怀元帅最后说，代表团不久就要离开北京返国了，我们诚恳地拜托代表团向阿拉伯联合共和国人民转达中国人民的敬意和友情。
    各国驻华使节和武官，也应邀出席了今晚的宴会。
