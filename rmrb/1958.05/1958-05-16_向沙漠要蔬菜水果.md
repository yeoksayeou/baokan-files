　　Demanding Vegetables and Fruits from the Desert

　　Deserts, not to mention growing green vegetables and fruits, even green grass is not easy to grow; but now we want to make the desert grow vegetables and fruits!

　　Since it was designated as an industrial base, the desert has prospered. Guangzhou cucumbers, and Beijing and Tianjin's cabbages, radishes, and tomatoes have all come to support the construction workers.

　　However, even though trains are overloaded, they can hardly keep up with the rapid increase in construction workers. Therefore, at the Party Congress, the representatives put forward the bold statement: demand vegetables and fruits from the desert.

　　The old people said: We have wanted to do this for generations, but have never succeeded.

　　This time, the municipal party secretary went to the suburbs, and cadres, workers, and peasants all marched into the desert to realize this generations-old wish: to demand vegetables and fruits from the desert and achieve self-sufficiency within three years.

　　The old people stroked their beards and smiled. According to their experience: With the Communist Party here, ideals will always be realized.　Baotou City　Zhang Mingying

    向沙漠要蔬菜水果
    沙漠，不要说不长青菜和水果，就是青草也不容易长成的；但是现在我们却要让沙漠长出蔬菜和水果来！
    自从辟为工业基地，沙漠繁荣起来了。广州黄瓜，北京、天津的白菜、萝卜、西红柿，都来支援建设的人们。
    但是，尽管火车超轴满载而来，也难赶得上建设的人们的急增。于是，在党代会上，代表们提出了豪迈的壮语：向沙漠索取蔬菜和水果。
    老人们说：咱世世代代都想过，但从未做成过。
    这回，市委书记下郊区，干部、工人、农民都向沙漠进军，为了实现这世世代代的愿望：向沙漠索取蔬菜和水果，三年内达到自给。
    老人们拈着胡髭，微笑着。根据他的经验：来了共产党，理想总会实现。　包头市　章明莹
