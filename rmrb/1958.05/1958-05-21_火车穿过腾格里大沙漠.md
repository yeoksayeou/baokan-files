Xinhua News Agency report: The first train carrying road-building materials on the Baotou-Lanzhou Railway safely arrived in Zhongwei County, east of the Tengger Desert, on the 16th.

The Tengger Desert spans three provinces (regions), including Inner Mongolia and Gansu. The train enters the vast desert from the northern part of Jingtai County in Gansu Province and travels for several hours before reaching Zhongwei. The desert here is characterized by its constantly shifting sands. When strong winds blow, sand dunes can become flat land, and flat land can turn into sand dunes. Near Zhongwei County, the railway also passes through a large sand mountain with a sand layer as thick as one hundred meters.

When road-building workers are working in such a vast desert, the workers at the front have just piled up the roadbed with sand, and the workers at the back immediately have to use pebbles to压住 the roadbed, otherwise the roadbed will be blown away by the wind without a trace. Therefore, road construction workers have to build sand fences and platforms on both sides of the roadbed to prevent wind and sand from eroding the roadbed and to ensure the safety of railway traffic.

### 火车穿过腾格里大沙漠

    火车穿过腾格里大沙漠
    据新华社讯　包兰铁路上的第一列运载筑路材料的火车，16日穿过腾格里沙漠安全到达沙漠东边的中卫县城。
    腾格里沙漠横跨内蒙古、甘肃等三省（区）。火车从甘肃省景泰县北部开始进入大沙漠，要穿行好几小时才能到达中卫。这里的沙漠随风飞舞，移动性很大，往往大风起时，沙丘变成平地、平地出现沙丘。在接近中卫县城的地方，铁路还穿过了一座大沙山，沙层厚达一百公尺。
    筑路工人在这样的大沙漠上施工时，前面的工人刚用沙子堆成路基，后面的工人立刻就要用卵石把路基压住，否则路基会被大风刮得无影无踪。因此，筑路职工不得不在路基两旁修筑防沙栏和平台，来防止风沙对路基的侵袭，保证铁路行车的安全。（附图片）
