Opinion Column:

    Since the "Double-Anti" movement, many readers have written letters suggesting the production of low-wattage light bulbs to supply the market, in order to conserve electricity. After studying this suggestion with relevant departments, their reply is: To manufacture 10-watt and 5-watt small light bulbs, the tungsten filament used as the raw material for the bulbs needs to be drawn very thin. According to the current domestic technical conditions, solving this technical problem will require a period of research and trial production. Relevant departments and production units are now researching and trial-producing thin tungsten filaments. Once the trial production is successful, small-wattage light bulbs can be produced in large quantities to supply the market. Editor

    小瓦数灯泡正在试制
    自“双反”运动以来，许多读者纷纷来信建议生产小瓦数灯泡供应市场，以节约用电。这个建议经过我们和有关部门研究，他们的答复是：制造十瓦和五瓦的小灯泡，需要把灯泡原材料钨丝拉制得很细，按照目前国内的技术条件，解决这个技术问题还要一段研究试制的时间。现在有关部门和生产单位正在研究试制细钨丝，等试制成功后，就可大量生产小瓦数灯泡供应市场。　　　　　编者
