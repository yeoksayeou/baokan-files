　　Everyone is Learning from Fengjie
    Some Counties Have Found New Methods for Making Fertilizer

    This newspaper's Chengdu dispatch, 16th: The experience of Fengjie County in manufacturing fertilizer using indigenous methods has been promoted throughout Sichuan. In recent months, more than 1,000 people from various regions have been sent to Fengjie to visit and learn fertilizer manufacturing techniques. Wanzhou, Luzhou, Yibin and other regions rich in sulfur have begun to use sulfur residue and low-grade sulfur ore to manufacture ammonium sulfate in large quantities. According to estimates from the Sichuan Provincial Chemical Industry Department, the province's forty-odd larger sulfur plants alone can produce more than 16,000 tons of ammonium sulfate this year. Many places that do not produce sulfur are also using coal gangue and some low-grade sulfur-containing ore to extract ammonium sulfate. In mid-April, the counties of Wanzhou Prefecture held an on-site meeting in Fengjie County, planning to launch a competition campaign for producing fertilizer using indigenous methods throughout the region. Pilot projects were conducted in counties, districts and townships in early April, and by May, all agricultural cooperatives should master the manufacturing technology, achieving fertilizer production in every township and cooperative. This prefecture plans to produce more than 24,000 tons of various fertilizers using indigenous methods this year.
    Driven by Fengjie County, a surge of experimental fertilizer production using indigenous methods has been launched in various places, and new approaches to manufacturing fertilizer using indigenous methods continue to emerge. Xingwen County Sulfur Plant, referring to Fengjie's methods, extracted ammonium sulfate from waste materials such as furnace slag, blast furnace ground soil, and waste furnace clay. Yunyang County manufactured a mixed potassium-magnesium fertilizer from the bittern of salt factories. Jiangjin County used steamed bone gas water to produce ammonium sulfate. The relevant leading departments of Sichuan Province attach great importance to Fengjie County's experience in manufacturing chemical fertilizer using indigenous methods. The Chemical Industry Bureau of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Industry has specially sent engineers to form a working group with local cadres, responsible for helping those who come to learn to master the manufacturing technology. On May 15th, Sichuan Province will hold a chemical fertilizer production meeting in Fengjie County to further summarize and promote the experience of manufacturing chemical fertilizer using indigenous methods.

　　大家都去学奉节
    有些县又找到了制化肥的新方法
    本报成都16日电　奉节县土法制造化肥的经验，已在四川各地推广，最近几个月来，各专区派到奉节参观学习制造化肥技术的人员达一千多名。盛产硫磺的万县、泸州、宜宾等专区已开始大量利用硫磺脚渣和磺贫矿制造硫酸铵。据四川省化工部门估计，仅全省四十多个较大的硫磺厂，今年即可生产硫酸铵一万六千多吨。许多不产硫磺的地方，也在利用煤钎石和某些低品位含硫矿石提炼硫酸铵。万县专区各县4月中旬在奉节县召开了现场会议，要在全区展开一个土法生产化肥的竞赛运动。4月上旬县区乡普遍试点，5月份所有农业社都能掌握制造技术，做到乡乡社社造化肥。这个专区今年就要用土法生产各种化肥二万四千多吨。
    在奉节县的带动下，各地掀起了土法试制化肥的热潮，土法制造化肥的新门路不断出现。兴文县硫磺厂参照奉节的办法，从炉渣、高炉地脚土、废炉坭砂等废物中提炼出硫酸铵。云阳县从盐厂的苦卤中制造出钾镁混合肥料。江津县利用蒸骨气水制成硫酸錏。四川省有关领导部门十分重视奉节县土法制造化学肥料的经验。四川省工业厅化工局专门派出工程师，会同当地干部组成工作组，负责帮助前来学习的人掌握制造技术。5月15日，四川省将在奉节县召开化学肥料生产会议，进一步总结和推广土法制造化学肥料的经验。
