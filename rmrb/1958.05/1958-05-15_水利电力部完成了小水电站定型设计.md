The Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power Completes Standardized Design for Small Hydropower Stations

(Our report) The Beijing Survey and Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power recently completed a set of standardized designs for small hydropower stations. The capacity of these small hydropower stations ranges from 100 to 1,000 kilowatts. They also reviewed and approved the standardized design for small hydropower stations below 100 kilowatts, which was designed by the former Beijing Water Conservancy Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources. Because the design fully considers the specific conditions in various counties and rural areas, the construction of these power stations is simple, and the civil engineering part can be completely carried out by local bricklayers, carpenters, and the masses themselves, and the building materials can basically be obtained locally. The power plant equipment is also designed to be as simple as possible. The water turbines and generators used in power stations above 100 kilowatts have a total of six models, which have a wide range of applications and are easy to manufacture in large quantities; the water turbines for power stations below 100 kilowatts can be made of wood. The operation of the power station is also relatively simple, generally requiring only two to three operators.

These small hydropower stations can be built on natural rivers and irrigation canals, and can also be combined with mass water conservancy projects. Different building types and sizes can be adopted according to different geological conditions, making them widely applicable.

The cost of these power stations is relatively low. The investment in a 1,200-kilowatt hydropower station is only 750,000 yuan, with an investment of about 600 yuan per kilowatt. A county with a population of about 250,000 people can build one by raising 3 yuan per person. The power generated by this power station is enough to supply a fertilizer plant with an annual output of 8,000 tons and other small factories; if it is all used for lighting, it can meet the lighting needs of about 100,000 to 200,000 residents. The investment in rural hydropower stations below 100 kilowatts is about 400 yuan per kilowatt. The investment in a 50-kilowatt power station is about 20,000 yuan, which can be raised by an agricultural cooperative of 5,000 people by raising 4 yuan per person. After completion, it can irrigate 2,500 mu of land, saving about 300 laborers, and can also be used for rural sideline processing; when used for lighting, it can meet the lighting needs of about 4,000 to 5,000 residents.

If we fully rely on the masses, give full play to the wisdom of the masses, and make use of local conditions and resources in the construction of the station, the investment in the power station can be greatly reduced.

### 水利电力部完成了小水电站定型设计

　　水利电力部完成了小水电站定型设计
    本报讯　水利电力部北京勘测设计院最近完成了一套小型水电站的定型设计。这套小型水电站的容量为一百到一千瓩。他们还审定了原水利部北京水利设计院设计的一百瓩以下的小型水电站的定型设计。由于在设计中充分考虑了各县和农村中的具体条件，因此这种电站施工简易，土建部分完全可以由当地的泥水木工及群众自行施工，建筑材料基本上可以就地取材。电厂设备也力求简单，一百瓩以上的电站所采用的水轮机及发电机共六种型号，适用的范围较大，便于大批制造；一百瓩以下的电站的水轮机，可以用木制。电站的运行也较简单，一般运转人员只需要二至三人。
    这套小型水电站可以建筑在天然河道上和灌溉渠道上，也可以和群众性的水利工程相结合。根据不同的地质条件，可以采用不同的建筑物型式及尺寸，适用范围较广。
    这些电站的造价比较便宜，一座一千二百瓩的水电站投资不过七十五万元，每瓩投资约在六百元左右，一个二十五万人左右的县，每人集资三元即可建成。这个电站的发电量足够供一座年产量八千吨的化肥厂和其它小型工厂之用；如果全部用来点灯，能满足十到二十万左右居民照明的需要。一百瓩以下的农村水电站，每瓩投资为四百元左右。一个五十瓩的电站投资约为二万元，一个五千人的农业社每人集资四元即可筹建，建成后可灌溉田地二千五百亩，节省劳动力三百个左右，还可供农村副业加工之用；用来点灯，可以满足四千到五千人左右居民照明的需要。
    如果在建站中充分依靠群众、发挥群众智慧，因陋就简，则电站的投资还可大大减低。
