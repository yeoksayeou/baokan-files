Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 23rd: TASS reported that on May 21, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Khrushchev wrote a letter to the Chairman of the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), Yukitaka Haraguchi, stating that if there were no foreign military bases on Japanese territory in the future, the Soviet government would be prepared to undertake the obligation not to use atomic or hydrogen weapons against Japan. If certain countries embark on the path of aggression and launch a nuclear war, and Japanese territory is not used by the aggressors against the Soviet Union and countries friendly to the Soviet Union, then, in this case, the Soviet government is also prepared to undertake the obligation to consider Japan as a country outside the scope of nuclear weapons use.

Khrushchev's letter was a reply to Haraguchi Yukitaka's letter of May 13th. In his letter, Haraguchi Yukitaka requested an answer to the following question in order to dispel certain concerns among the Japanese people: If Japan, including Okinawa, reaches an agreement with the United States and the United Kingdom to decide not to arm Japan with nuclear weapons, nor to import such weapons from abroad, would the Soviet Union promise that it would not subject Japan to atomic attacks?

In answering this question, Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union does not intend to attack anyone, including Japan.

Khrushchev also said that the Soviet government believes that the most reliable way to eliminate the threat of atomic war breaking out in Japan is to remove foreign military bases in Japan. It has no doubt that the Japanese people will have sufficient strength to realize the removal of foreign military bases on their national territory and ensure that Japan pursues a truly independent and peaceful policy.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet people deeply sympathize with and understand the Japanese people's struggle to ban atomic and hydrogen weapons and to ban the testing of such weapons because the Japanese people were the first to suffer the tragic consequences of atomic attacks. The Japanese people's struggle is of particular significance today, when Japan is being transformed into a foreign military base.

Khrushchev pointed out that the US government, which continues to occupy Japanese territory with troops, openly says that it does not intend to abandon its policy of further intensifying the nuclear arms race and maintaining military bases in the territory of other countries that are far from the United States but close to the borders of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. Obviously, in this case, Japan can easily be drawn into an atomic war unwillingly, or even without being notified.

In his letter, Haraguchi Yukitaka "expressed gratitude and deep joy" for the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing.

He also stated that the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan will launch a larger-scale movement to make the United States and the United Kingdom also follow the Soviet Union's actions, immediately stop nuclear weapons testing, and conclude an agreement on stopping such testing.

    赫鲁晓夫复信日本“总评”议长表示
    撤除在日本的外国军事基地  日本即可免遭原子战争威胁
    据新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫21日写信给日本工会总评议会议长原口幸隆说，如果将来在日本领土上没有外国军事基地，那末苏联政府准备承担不对日本使用原子武器和氢武器的义务。如果某些国家走上侵略的道路和发动了核战争、而日本领土没有被侵略者用来反对苏联和同苏联友好的国家，那末，苏联政府在这种情况下也准备承担义务，认为日本是使用核武器范围以外的国家。
    赫鲁晓夫的信是答复原口幸隆5月13日的来信的。原口幸隆在信中提出，为了消除日本人民中的某种顾虑，请求回答以下的问题：如果日本、包括冲绳岛同美英两国达成协议，决定不用核武器武装日本，也不从国外运入这种武器，那末苏联是否能答应它不会使日本遭受原子袭击。
    赫鲁晓夫在答复这一问题时说，苏联不打算进攻任何人，也包括日本在内。
    赫鲁晓夫还说，苏联政府相信，消除在日本境内爆发原子战争的威胁的最可靠的途径是撤除在日本境内的外国军事基地。它毫不怀疑，日本人民会有足够的力量来实现撤除在本国领土上的外国军事基地和保证日本执行真正的独立、和平的政策。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联人民非常同情和理解日本人民争取禁止原子武器和氢武器以及禁止试验这种武器的斗争。因为日本人民第一个遭受到了原子攻击的悲惨后果。日本人民的这个斗争，在日本正在变为外国军事基地的今天，具有特别的意义。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，继续用军队占领着日本领土的美国政府公开说，它不打算放弃进一步加紧核军备竞赛、在那些距美国很远但接近苏联和其他社会主义国家边境的他国领土上保有军事基地的方针。显然，在这种情况下，日本很容易在并不甘心情愿，甚至没有得到通知的情况下就被卷入原子战争。
    原口幸隆在他的信里对苏联单方面停止核武器试验的措施“表示感激和深深的喜悦”。
    他还声明，日本工会总评议会将展开规模更大的运动，使美英两国也仿效苏联的行动、立刻停止核武器试验并缔结关于停止这种试验的协定。
