    Laos will hold a supplementary election of National Assembly members on May 4th. This is a step taken to implement the agreement between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units of last November. It is of great significance to the future development of the Lao situation. Therefore, all patriotic Lao people and those who care about the Lao situation hope that this by-election will promote national unity and national unification in Laos, and will be conducive to the peace and independence of Laos. However, the current situation in Laos shows that it is still a very serious problem to ensure that this by-election can be conducted fairly and smoothly.
    The recent letter from Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, to Prime Minister Phouma of the Kingdom of Laos and Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, is worthy of attention. Prince Souphanouvong cited a large number of facts to prove that in recent months, many former Lao Fighting Unit personnel and other Lao patriots have been persecuted, and the Lao Patriotic Party's election campaigns have been discriminated against and obstructed. He also pointed out that in areas such as Sam Neua Province and Luang Prabang, there have even been incidents of fabricating charges, arresting, and even publicly or secretly killing former Lao Fighting Unit personnel and patriotic party members. Therefore, Prince Souphanouvong requested Prime Minister Phouma to take effective measures to immediately stop such discrimination and retaliatory actions. Prince Souphanouvong's request is completely legitimate and reasonable. It has already been taken seriously by the International Commission for Laos. On April 18th, Mr. Ansari, Chairman of the International Commission for Laos, wrote to Prime Minister Phouma, believing that some events occurring in Laos would weaken the spirit of reconciliation between the Royal Lao Government and the former Lao Fighting Units, and he expressed his hope that the Royal Lao Government would take appropriate measures to clarify the Lao situation.
    As everyone knows, Article 15 of the Lao Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities clearly stipulates that all parties agree not to retaliate against or discriminate against individuals and groups for their activities during the period of hostilities, and to guarantee their democratic freedoms. Paragraph 3 of the Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference also reiterated the Lao government's statement regarding its willingness to take measures to enable all citizens to participate in national common life. At the same time, according to the agreement between the Royal Lao Government and the former Lao Fighting Units, former Lao Fighting Unit personnel enjoy the rights of citizens and the right to participate in the country's political life, and no retaliation against them is allowed. The Lao Patriotic Party is, in fact, the representative of the interests of the former Lao Fighting Units and their sympathizers, and its legal status and activities should of course be guaranteed. The Royal Lao Government has an obligation to abide by these promises. Therefore, it is very clear that many of the facts listed in Prince Souphanouvong's letter have already caused great harm to the thorough implementation of the Geneva Accords in Laos and the implementation of the agreements reached between the Royal Lao Government and the Lao Fighting Units. As Prince Souphanouvong said, the recent actions of discriminating against and persecuting former Lao Fighting Unit personnel and Lao Patriotic Party members cannot but be considered as an attempt by some people to re-ignite discord and division. The seriousness of the problem lies here. Where is Laos going? Is it to earnestly implement the agreements reached between the Royal Lao Government and the former Lao Fighting Units in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and further realize peaceful unification? Or is it to tolerate certain reactionary forces undermining the agreements and allowing Laos to be re-divided? Patriotic people from all walks of life in Laos will know that only the first path is in line with the interests of the Lao nation.
    The serious situation currently emerging in Laos is not accidental. The facts of the past few years have proved that whenever Laos moves towards the path of peaceful unification and consolidating national independence, the United States will always instigate certain reactionary forces to desperately obstruct it. Since the establishment of the Lao coalition government last November, the United States has never forgotten to try to re-ignite division and civil war in Laos in order to overthrow the coalition government and develop the Lao situation according to the plans of the White House and the Pentagon. Recently, the United States has concentrated its efforts on attempting to undermine the upcoming supplementary elections in Laos. The propaganda machine of the United States is constantly spreading news about the so-called re-emergence of military conflicts in northern Laos, which is obviously ulterior motives. These activities of the United States are worthy of deep consideration by every Lao person who cares about the fate of their motherland: if the situation of discord and division re-emerges in Laos, then it can only be beneficial to the American interventionists first and foremost, because this is precisely what they have been dreaming of.
    The Chinese people are very pleased to see that the Lao people have won many major victories in the struggle for peace, unification and independence in the past few years. We believe that the establishment of the Lao coalition government, the implementation of various agreements between the Royal Lao Government and the former Lao Fighting Units, including the upcoming supplementary elections, are important steps towards further realizing and consolidating the peace, unification and independence of Laos, and are also in line with the interests of peace in the entire Indochina region. We sincerely hope that the Royal Lao Government and patriotic people from all walks of life can strengthen unity, guarantee that this supplementary election can be conducted fairly and smoothly in accordance with the spirit of the Geneva Accords, so that Laos can continue to move forward along the path of peace, unification and independence.

### 应该保证老挝补选顺利进行

    应该保证老挝补选顺利进行
    老挝将于5月4日举行国民议会议员补充选举。这是为了执行去年11月老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队双方的协议而采取的一个步骤。它对于今后老挝局势的发展是有重要意义的。因此，一切爱国的老挝人民和关心老挝局势的人们都希望，通过这次的补选，将会促进老挝的民族团结和国家统一，并有利于老挝的和平和独立。但是，目前老挝出现的情况表明，要使这次补选能够公正和顺利地进行，还是一个十分严重的问题。
    最近公布的老挝爱国党中央执行委员会主席苏发努冯写给老挝王国首相富马和老挝国际委员会主席安萨里的信，是值得重视的。苏发努冯列举了大量事实证明，近几个月来，许多前寮国战斗部队人员和其他老挝爱国人士遭到迫害，老挝爱国党的竞选活动受到歧视和阻挠。他并且指出，在桑怒省和琅勃剌邦等地方，甚至发生了捏造罪名控告、逮捕以至公开或秘密杀害前寮国战斗部队人员和爱国党员的事件。因此，苏发努冯要求富马首相采取有效措施，立即停止这种歧视和报复行动。苏发努冯的这个要求是完全正当合理的。它已经受到老挝国际委员会的重视。4月18日，老挝国际委员会主席安萨里写信给富马首相，认为老挝国内发生的一些事件，势将削弱老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队之间的和解精神，他表示希望老挝王国政府采取适当措施，以澄清老挝局势。
    大家知道，老挝停止敌对行动协定第十五条明文规定，各方约定不因个人和团体在敌对行为期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由。日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条也重申老挝政府关于愿意采取措施使全体公民都能参加全国共同生活的声明。同时，根据老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队双方的协议，前寮国战斗部队人员享有公民权和参加国家政治生活的权利，而不允许对他们进行任何报复。老挝爱国党，事实上就是前寮国战斗部队及其同情者的利益的代表者，它的合法地位和活动当然也应该得到保障。老挝王国政府有遵守这些诺言的义务。因此，很显然，苏发努冯的信中所列举的许多事实，对于在老挝彻底实施日内瓦协议，和执行老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队所达成的协议，已经造成很大的危害。正如苏发努冯所说，最近发生的歧视和迫害前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国党党员的行动，不能不认为是有人企图重新挑起不和和分裂。问题的严重性就在这里。老挝究竟往何处去？是根据日内瓦协议的精神，认真执行老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队所达成的协议，进一步实现和平统一呢？还是容忍某些反动势力破坏协议，让老挝重新分裂呢？老挝各阶层的爱国人士都会知道，只有第一条道路，才是符合老挝民族利益的。
    老挝目前出现的严重情况，并不是偶然的。过去几年的事实证明，每逢老挝向着和平统一和巩固民族独立的道路前进时，美国总要策动某些反动势力拚命加以阻挠。自从去年11月老挝成立联合政府以来，美国就时刻不忘地企图在老挝重新挑起分裂和内战，以便推翻联合政府，使老挝局势按照白宫和五角大楼的计划发展。最近，美国更是集中力量企图破坏老挝的这次补充选举。美国的宣传机器不断散布所谓老挝北部军事冲突重新爆发的消息，显然是别有用心的。美国的这些活动，值得每一个关怀祖国命运的老挝人深思：如果老挝重新出现不和和分裂的局面，那么首先只能是对美国干涉者有利，因为这正是它梦寐以求之的事情。
    中国人民非常高兴地看到，几年以来，老挝人民在争取和平、统一与独立的斗争中已经赢得许多重大的胜利。我们认为，老挝联合政府的成立，老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队之间各项协议的实施，包括即将举行的补充选举，都是进一步实现和巩固老挝和平、统一与独立的重要步骤，并且也是符合整个印度支那地区和平利益的。我们衷心希望老挝王国政府和各阶层爱国人士能够加强团结，根据日内瓦协议的精神，保证这次的补充选举能够公平地顺利地进行，从而使老挝能够沿着和平、统一与独立的道路继续前进。
