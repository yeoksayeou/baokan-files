If You Dare to Think It, You Dare to Do It
Tianjin Communist Youth League Member Xue Lantian Builds Makeshift Waterworks

(Reported by this newspaper) According to the Tianjin Daily, Xue Lantian, a 22-year-old Communist Youth League member from Lilou Township, Xijiao District, Tianjin, with the support of the Party organization, took the lead in building the first rural filtration pond in the suburbs based on the principle of waterworks, enabling the people of Lilou Village to conveniently drink clean water.

This newly built filtration pond is basically a prototype of the Tianjin city waterworks. The mixing and sedimentation pond can hold 22 tons of turbid water drawn from the Nanyun River. The "tap water" that flows into the clear water pond after sand filtration and disinfection amounts to 18 tons, which can solve the drinking water problem for 1,600 people. The Municipal Health and Epidemic Prevention Station once tested the water quality, and the result was that there were no E. coli in each liter of clear water, which was similar to the tap water in the city.

For many years, the people of Lilou Village had to fetch water from the Nanyun River. In addition to being tiring, it also delayed production time, and the water quality was turbid. When fetching water, the people of Lilou Village always frowned, using a small carrying pole to guide the buckets into the river with their eyes closed, and then carrying the muddy water home. After testing, such river water contained as many as 9,009 E. coli per liter; there were especially many miscellaneous bacteria, with 16,000 in each milliliter (one-thousandth of a liter).

In October of last year, Party Secretary Li Zhongyuan, Deputy Secretary Wang Ruilan, and Xue Lantian repeatedly studied this issue and finally decided to build a "waterworks" themselves. Xue Lantian was particularly excited and full of energy. He readily accepted the task of building a "waterworks" himself. He said, "If you dare to think it, you dare to do it!"

After the news of the construction of the filtration pond spread, most of the commune members actively supported it, but some did not, and some even deliberately made sarcastic remarks, saying that it was a "waste of money and labor." Xue Lantian became anxious when he heard this. But the Party Secretary encouraged him: "Is building socialism good or not? There are still people who don't agree with it! To make a revolution, you must dare to speak and dare to act. Go ahead, and I will solve any problems for you." Xue Lantian calmed down and continued to work.

In April of this year, with the support and encouragement of the Party, and with the help of experienced workers, Xue Lantian finally succeeded in building the waterworks.

On May 15th, the "tap water" was officially opened, and the whole village was abuzz. Old men, young men, young women, elementary school students, and even those who had previously ridiculed Xue Lantian, all happily carried water buckets and lined up in a "single file" at the water outlet of the clear water pond. Thirty or forty pairs of eyes stared at the faucet, and people were extremely happy.

### 既敢这么想　就敢这么干  天津共青团员薛蓝田建成土造自来水厂

    既敢这么想　就敢这么干
    天津共青团员薛蓝田建成土造自来水厂
    本报讯　据天津日报消息：天津市西郊区李楼乡二十二岁的共青团员薛蓝田在党组织的支持下，根据自来水厂的原理，带头修成了郊区第一座农村滤水池，使全李楼村的人民都能方便地喝上清洁的水。
    这座新建的滤水池，基本上就像天津市内自来水厂的一个雏形。这个池的混合沉淀池能容纳二十二吨引自南运河的浑水，经过砂滤消毒流入清水池的“自来水”也足有十八吨，可以解决一千六百人饮水问题。市卫生防疫站曾经鉴定过水质，结果是在每升清水中无大肠菌，与市内的自来水差不多。
    多少年来，李楼村的人民要喝水，都得到南运河去挑，吃累不算，还耽误了生产时间，而且水质污浊。李楼村的人们在挑水的时候，总是皱着眉头，用小扁担牵着水桶闭着眼睛往河里一顺，一挑浑汤就担进了家。经过化验，这样的河水每升含大肠菌达九千零九个之多；杂菌尤其多，在每毫升（一升的千分之一）中就有一万六千个。
    去年10月间，党委书记李中原、副书记王瑞兰和薛蓝田等曾对这个问题作了反复研究，最后决定自办一个“自来水厂”。薛蓝田更是兴奋得满身是劲，他痛快地接受了自造“自来水厂”的任务。他说：“既敢这么想，就敢这么干！”
    在兴建滤水池的消息传出后，大部分社员都积极支持，但是也有人不支持，甚至还有人故意说怪话，说这是“伤财费工”的事。薛蓝田一听就急了。但是党委书记鼓励他：“建设社会主义好不好？可还有人不赞成哩！闹革命，要敢说敢干，你去吧，有问题我给你解决。”薛蓝田又沉下心干去了。
    今年4月，薛蓝田在党的支持和鼓舞下，又有老师傅帮忙，终于建设成功了。
    5月15日，“自来水”正式开放，全村沸腾起来了。老头子、小伙子、大姑娘、小学生，甚至过去讽刺过薛蓝田的人，都喜笑颜开地提着水桶，在清水池取水处依次排了个“一字长蛇阵”，三、四十双眼睛一致盯住了水龙头，人们真是高兴极了。
