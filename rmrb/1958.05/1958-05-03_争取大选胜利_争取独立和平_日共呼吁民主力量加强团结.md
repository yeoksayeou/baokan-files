Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 2nd: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on May 1st, again calling on the Japanese people to work hard to ensure the victory of Democratic Party candidates in the general election.

The statement said that in order to change Japan's politics and build a peaceful, independent, democratic, and prosperous Japan, the Japanese democratic forces, including the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, trade unions, and all democratic groups, should strengthen unity to eliminate the politics of subordination to the United States, revival of militarism, allowing the United States to bring nuclear weapons into Japan, and rampant unemployment and poverty.

The statement exposed the absurd propaganda of the Japanese government and the bourgeois news and broadcasting stations that portray this general election as a "competition between two major parties." The statement pointed out that Japan's history since the end of World War II has proven that in every general election, the forces in Japan striving for peace, independence, and democracy have become stronger and stronger. The statement said that the Liberal Democratic Party has greatly lost its credibility in the eyes of the Japanese people, and the domestic and international situation is very favorable to the democratic forces in Japan.

The statement stated that the Japanese Communist Party will fight to the end to overthrow the traitorous and reactionary Nobusuke Kishi government, strive for Japan's independence and peace, and strengthen the unity of the people.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 2nd: Thirty-two prominent figures in the Japanese cultural circles jointly issued a statement on May 1st, demanding the establishment of a government that is faithful to the Constitution. Signatories to the statement include Daichi Hyoe, President of Hosei University, Hiroshi Wakegawa, President of Ritsumeikan University, and author Tatsuzo Ishikawa.

    争取大选胜利　争取独立和平
    日共呼吁民主力量加强团结
    新华社2日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会在5月1日发表声明，再次号召日本人民努力争取民主党派候选人在大选中获得胜利。
    声明说，为了改变日本的政治，建设和平、独立、民主、繁荣的日本，包括共产党、社会党、工会以及所有民主团体在内的日本民主力量，应该加强团结，以消灭屈属美国、复活军国主义、让美国把核武器运进日本境内以及失业和贫穷到处泛滥的政治。
    声明揭露日本政府和资产阶级新闻广播电台把这次大选说成是“两大政党竞选”的荒谬宣传。声明指出，第二次世界大战结束以来的日本历史证明，每一次大选，日本争取和平、独立、民主的力量都越来越强大。声明说，自由民主党在日本人民心目中已经大大地失去了信用，国内形势和国际形势对于日本的民主力量非常有利。
    声明表示，日共将为打倒卖国反动的岸信介政府，争取日本的独立与和平以及加强人民的团结全力斗争到底。
    据新华社2日讯　东京消息：三十二名日本文化界著名人士在1日联合发表声明，要求建立忠实于宪法的政府。在声明书上签名的有，法政大学校长大内兵卫、立命馆大学校长禾川博、作家石川达三等。
