Italian General Election

    The Italian parliamentary election held on May 25th is the third general election held in Italy since it changed from a monarchy to a republic in June 1946. The previous two general elections were held on April 18, 1948, and June 7-8, 1953.

    According to the constitution, the Italian Parliament is the highest organ of state power, composed of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. Members of the Chamber of Deputies are elected by universal suffrage, with one member elected for every 80,000 residents. Candidates must be at least 25 years old and serve a five-year term. Senators are elected by each region in proportion to the population, with one senator elected for every 200,000 residents. Candidates must be at least 40 years old and serve a six-year term. It is reported that 33 million voters will participate in the voting this year, electing 596 members of the Chamber of Deputies and 246 senators.

    A joint session of the two houses of Parliament elects the President, who serves a seven-year term. The President nominates and appoints the Prime Minister, but must obtain the confidence of Parliament. Ministers are nominated by the Prime Minister and appointed by the President.

    This election is for both houses of Parliament simultaneously. Originally, according to the constitution, the Chamber of Deputies was to be re-elected this year, while the Senate was to be re-elected in 1959. However, in order to ensure that its majority in the Chamber of Deputies would not be affected by the Senate's non-re-election, the Christian Democratic Party dissolved the Senate, thereby holding simultaneous elections for members of both houses this year.

    The first government after Italy became a republic was a coalition government composed of the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party. In May 1947, under the instruction of the United States, the Christian Democratic Party ousted the Communist Party and the Socialist Party from the government. For more than a decade thereafter, power has been in the hands of the Christian Democratic Party.

    For more than a decade, under the rule of the Christian Democratic Party, the large monopoly capitalists and privileged groups who had led Italy to fascism and war adventures regained their economic dominance. The totalitarianism of church forces threatens democratic freedoms and rights, leaving Italy, with a population of 48 million, with 2 million long-term unemployed, 12 million poor people, and 2 million people migrating abroad. At the same time, the Italian government has consistently followed the US "Cold War" and arms race policies, and advocated the establishment of US missile bases in Italy, pushing Italy towards a devastating disaster.

    The Christian Democratic Party government, supported by US imperialism, and in long-term alliance with the right-wing Social Democratic Party, Republican Party, and Liberal Party, has been implementing reactionary policies, arousing increasing dissatisfaction among people of all social strata, and its political position has been declining. In the 1948 general election, the Christian Democratic Party obtained 48.7% of the total votes and won 307 of the 574 seats in the Chamber of Deputies; but in the 1953 general election, it lost more than 1.85 million votes and obtained only 261 of the 590 seats in the Chamber of Deputies. In contrast, the prestige of the Italian Communist Party has grown rapidly. In the 1953 general election, it obtained 6.12 million votes, accounting for 22% of the total votes. It holds 143 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, becoming the second largest party in Parliament.

    The current international situation in which the East wind prevails over the West wind, and the growth of democratic and progressive forces in Italy, are unfavorable to the reactionary parties in Italy. Last year, the ruling party alliance (Christian Democratic Party, Social Democratic Party, Republican Party, Liberal Party) also split. However, the Christian Democratic Party is still doing its utmost to carry out hypocritical election propaganda, promising to implement socio-economic reforms and other promises to deceive voters, and attempting to rely on the intervention of church forces to obtain an absolute majority in Parliament and implement clerical autocracy. The Vatican has openly proposed to make Italy a "Catholic Italy." The extreme right-wing monarchists and neo-fascists are also plotting to form a "Greater Right-Wing Group" and are making trouble.

    The Italian Communist Party has launched a large-scale election campaign, successfully holding thousands of rallies, and put forward a resounding election program. In its program, the ICP advocates internally for the full implementation of the constitution, the elimination of agricultural monopoly groups, and the struggle against industrial monopoly organizations, so as to free the people from unemployment, poverty and backwardness; externally, it advocates pursuing a policy of peace and international cooperation, opposing the establishment of US missile bases, and supporting the anti-colonialist struggle, in order to strive for Italy's peace, independence and security. In order to defeat the election conspiracy of the reactionary forces, the Italian Communist Party requested the Socialist Party to jointly campaign, but unfortunately this proposal, which was in the interests of the Italian people, was not accepted by the Socialist Party. Although the Italian Socialist Party has put forward an election program similar to that of the ICP, the split of left-wing parties can only benefit the reactionary forces in the election.

### 意大利大选

    意大利大选
    5月25日举行的意大利议会选举，是意大利1946年6月改帝制为共和政体以来举行的第三次大选。前两次的大选是1948年4月18日和1953年6月7—8日举行的。
    根据宪法的规定，意大利议会是国家最高权力机关，由众议院和参议院组成。众议员由普选产生，每八万居民中选出一名议员，年满二十五岁者始可当选，任期五年。参议员由各区按人口比例选出，每二十万居民中选一名，年满四十岁者始可当选，任期六年。据报道，今年参加投票的选民将达三千三百万人，要选出众议员五百九十六人，参议员二百四十六人。
    议会两院联席会议选出总统。总统任期七年。总统提名任命总理，但须获得议会信任。各部部长由总理提名后总统任命。
    这次大选是两院同时选举。本来按宪法规定，众议院在今年改选，而参议院则要在1959年改选。但天主教民主党为了它在众议院取得多数后，不致因参院未改选而影响它的一党统治，于是解散了参议院，从而在今年同时改选众、参两院的议员。
    意大利改为共和政体后的第一届政府，是由天主教民主党、社会党、共产党等组成的联合政府。1947年5月在美国授意下，天主教民主党将共产党和社会党排挤出政府。此后十几年来，政权一直掌握在天主教民主党手中。
    十几年来，在天主教民主党统治下，曾把意大利导向法西斯主义和战争冒险的大垄断资本家和特权集团重新取得了经济上的统治地位，教会势力的极权主义威胁着民主自由权利，使四千八百万人口的意大利拥有二百万长期失业人口、一千二百万贫民和二百万人迁往国外。与此同时，意大利政府一贯追随美国的“冷战”和备战政策，并主张在意大利设置美国导弹基地，把意大利推向毁灭性的灾难。
    天主教民主党政府得到美帝国主义的支持，并同右翼社会民主党、共和党、自由党长期结成联盟，执行着反动的政策，引起了各阶层人民越来越大的不满，政治地位日益低落。1948年大选时天主教民主党获得总票数的48.7％，在众议院五百七十四席中取得了三百零七席；但在1953年大选时丧失了一百八十五万多张选票，在众议院五百九十席中只得到二百六十一席。相反地，意大利共产党的威望却迅速增长，在1953年大选中获得了六百一十二万张选票，占总票数的22％。在众议院中拥有一百四十三席，成为议会中的第二大党。
    目前东风压倒西风的国际形势，和意大利民主进步力量的增长，对意大利的反动政党是不利的。去年执政党派联盟（天主教民主党、社会民主党、共和党、自由党）又已发生了分裂。但天主教民主党仍在竭力进行虚伪的竞选宣传，以保证实行社会经济改革等诺言，欺骗选民，并企图依靠教会势力的干预，取得议会的绝对多数，实行教权专政。梵蒂岗公开提出要使意大利成为“天主教的意大利”。极右分子保皇党人和新法西斯分子也在策划组成“大右翼集团”，蠢蠢欲动。
    意大利共产党展开了大规模的竞选活动，成功地举行了数千次集会，提出了响亮的竞选纲领。意共在纲领中对内主张全部实施宪法，消灭农业垄断集团，向工业垄断组织进行斗争，使人民摆脱失业、贫困和落后的境地；对外主张奉行和平和国际合作政策，反对设置美国导弹基地，支持反殖民主义斗争，以争取意大利的和平、独立和安全。为了击败反动势力的竞选阴谋，意大利共产党要求社会党联合竞选，可惜这个符合意大利人民利益的建议，没有得到社会党的接受。意大利社会党虽然提出了与意共相类似的竞选纲领，但左翼党派的分裂状况只能有利于反动派的竞选。
