Xinhua News Agency, 17th: The news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of its third artificial satellite continues to generate strong reactions around the world.

The news greatly shocked the American scientific community. At a banquet, prominent American rocket expert Braun said that the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite was large enough to carry several people and that it was launched with an intercontinental ballistic missile, "something we don't have yet." Joseph Kaplan, chairman of the U.S. National Committee for the International Geophysical Year, said that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite was a "stunning step" in accelerating mankind's journey to the moon.

The news was also the focus of attention for American morning newspapers on the 16th.

Lambert, a reporter for the "New York Herald Tribune," wrote in a dispatch from Washington: "Military scientists said today that Russia's launch of its third satellite once again proves that it is ahead of the United States in rocketry."

The reporter wrote, "An astronautics expert here said that Russia is using its third satellite to conduct scientific experiments in interstellar space that have not yet been done in the American satellite program. These studies include: the concentration of positive ions, the strength of the Earth's magnetic field, the intensity of solar corpuscular radiation, and the distribution of photons and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays."

"New York Times" reporter Finney reported from Washington, "According to U.S. official calculations, it will be at least two years before the United States can launch a satellite weighing one and a half tons."

An article by the famous Sullivan, published in the "New York Times," pointed out, "The satellite launched by the Soviet Union yesterday is equipped with many experimental instruments, almost equal to the total number of instruments that the United States plans to launch during the Geophysical Year."

French newspapers, in their comments, all emphasized that the Soviet Union had achieved remarkable achievements in science and technology.

"L'Echo" said, "The achievements of the Russians in the manufacture of rocket super fuels and shells exceed all the most daring predictions." It believes that the United States lags far behind the Soviet Union in this regard.

"Combat" wrote, "The third satellite is an important stage in mastering the road between the Earth and the Moon."

"Paris-Journal" pointed out that the weight of the Soviet Union's new Earth satellite "surprised experts in Paris."

"L'Humanité" published an interview with Professor Joliot-Curie, who told the newspaper that this Soviet satellite showed, "what science can do when it conducts peaceful research for the benefit of human progress, and therefore I believe that billions of people around the world today will be as happy as I am."

In Britain, "The Scotsman," in an editorial commenting on the Soviet Union's launch of its third satellite, said, "The power of the Soviet rocket has once again shaken the world."

The science commentator for "The Manchester Guardian" wrote, "This latest achievement of the Russians once again eloquently demonstrates their ability to launch large rockets with exceptional precision."

West German newspapers described in detail the scientific and technical data of the new Soviet satellite, while paying particular attention to the unprecedented enormous weight of the satellite. The newspapers concluded that the Soviet Union possesses a huge advantage in rocket technology.

The Italian newspaper "l'Unità" wrote, "A real flying laboratory has been launched into space. With the appearance of each such laboratory, people will further enrich their knowledge of the universe." "Avanti!" and "La Notte" both considered the third satellite to be a new outstanding scientific achievement of the Soviet Union.

Newspapers in Greece, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and other countries all pointed out that the launch of the Soviet Union's third satellite was one of the greatest achievements in modern science, and another major victory for mankind in conquering interstellar space.

At the Brussels World's Fair in Belgium, the radio station announced the news of the Soviet Union's launch of its third artificial Earth satellite on the 15th. Many people visiting the Soviet Pavilion at the time warmly applauded to congratulate the Soviet Union's outstanding achievements in science and technology.

Newspapers in Delhi continue to welcome the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite.

The Hindi "Naya Bharat Times" said on the 17th that the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite further illustrates the Soviet Union's leading position in the field of science.

Kyodo News said that the Soviet Union's new satellite has an astonishing weight, and American satellites cannot be compared with it at all, which powerfully proves that the Soviet Union possesses intercontinental missiles.

    苏联科学卓越成就无可争辩
　　第三颗红星又震动全世界
    布劳恩承认美国还没有洲际火箭
    本报综合报道　据新华社17日讯：苏联成功发射第三个人造卫星的消息，在世界各国中继续引起强烈的反应。
    这个消息使美国科学界大为震动。美国著名火箭专家布劳恩在一次宴会上说，苏联第三个人造卫星大得够运载几个人，它是用洲际弹道火箭来发射上天的，“而我们还没有这种东西”。美国国际地球物理年全国委员会主席卡普兰说，苏联第三个卫星发射成功是加速人类飞往月球的一个“惊人步骤”。
    这个消息也成为16日美国晨报的注意中心。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”记者兰伯特在发自华盛顿的消息中写道：“军事科学界人士今天说，俄国发射第三个卫星再次证明它在火箭方面居于美国之上。”
    这位记者写道，“这里的一位星际飞行专家说，俄国利用第三个卫星将在星际空间进行一些科学试验，这些试验是美国人造卫星计划中还没有做过的。这些研究包括：正离子的浓度、地球磁场的强度、太阳的微分子辐射强度、宇宙线中光子和重核的分布。”
    “纽约时报”记者芬尼自华盛顿报道说，“据美国官方人士计算，美国要想发射一吨半重的卫星最早还得两年以后。”
    “纽约时报”发表的著名沙利文的一篇文章指出，“苏联昨天发射的卫星装有许多试验用仪器，几乎同美国打算在地球物理年期间发射的卫星的仪器总和相等。”
    法国报纸在评论中都强调指出：苏联在科学技术方面已经取得了卓越的成就。
    “回声报”说，“俄国人在制造火箭的超级燃料和外壳方面所取得的成就超过了一切最大胆的推测。”它认为，美国在这方面远远地落在苏联后面。
    “战斗报”写道，“第三颗卫星是掌握地球和月球之间道路的重要阶段。”
    “巴黎人民报”指出，苏联新的地球卫星的重量“使巴黎的专家们吃惊”。
    “人道报”登载约里奥—居里教授向该报记者发表的谈话说，这颗苏联卫星表明了，“当科学为人类进步的利益而进行和平研究时，科学能够做什么，因此我相信，今天全世界的亿万人民都会同我一样高兴。”
    在英国，“苏格兰人报”在评苏联发射的第三个卫星的社论中说，“苏联火箭的威力又一次震动了全世界”。
    “曼彻斯特卫报”科学评论员写道：“俄国人的这一最新成就再一次雄辩地表明，他们有能力异常精准地发射大型火箭。”
    西德报纸详细地描述了苏联新卫星的科学技术资料，同时特别注意到，卫星空前的巨大重量。报纸得出结论说：苏联在火箭技术方面拥有巨大的优势。
    意大利“团结报”写到：“一个真正的飞行实验室射入了宇宙空间。随着每一个这样的实验室的出现，人们将更加丰富自己对宇宙的知识。”“前进报”和“国家报”都认为第三个卫星是苏联新的卓越的科学成就。
    希腊、瑞典、丹麦、荷兰等国报纸都指出，苏联第三个卫星的发射，是现代科学中的一个最伟大的成就。是人类征服星际空间的又一重大胜利。
    在比利时的首都布鲁塞尔世界博览会上，电台15日宣布了苏联发射第三个人造地球卫星的消息，当时在苏联馆里参观的许多人热烈鼓掌祝贺苏联科学技术的这个卓越成就。
    德里报纸继续表示欢迎苏联发射第三个人造卫星成功。
    印地文“新印度时报”17日说，苏联第三个人造卫星发射成功更进一步说明了苏联在科学领域中的领先地位。
    日本共同社说，苏联新卫星有惊人的重量，美国卫星完全不能与之相比，这有力地证明了苏联拥有洲际导弹。
