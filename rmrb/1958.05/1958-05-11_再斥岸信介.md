In his talk with Xinhua News Agency reporters on May 9th, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi sternly condemned the anti-China actions of the Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government. The Chinese people express their warm support and endorsement of this statement.

The Japanese Kishi Nobusuke government, after sabotaging the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, proceeded to take action that condoned Japanese thugs tearing down our national flag, an act hostile to the Chinese people. The Chinese people cannot help but express their indignation once again at Kishi Nobusuke's provocative act, which damages the dignity of our national flag and insults our people.

Kishi Nobusuke's hostility towards the Chinese people did not begin today. As early as 1936, Kishi Nobusuke served as a high-ranking official in the puppet Manchukuo, oppressing and exploiting the people of Northeast China, and had deep collusion with the Japanese Kwantung Army warlords who invaded our Northeast. In October 1941, when Hideki Tojo, the ringleader who launched the Pacific War of aggression for Japanese imperialism and the head of the Japanese Kwantung Army warlords, organized his cabinet, Kishi Nobusuke became the Minister of Commerce and Industry, and later became the Vice-Minister of Munitions in the Tojo cabinet. Kishi Nobusuke's following of the most aggressive Kwantung Army warlords not only ruined his reputation but also brought profound disasters to the Japanese people. However, Kishi Nobusuke did not learn from this. Not long after, he is now attempting to find a way out for Japanese monopoly capital by following the old path of following the United States and reviving Japanese militarism. It can truly be said that it is difficult to alter one's fundamental nature.

Kishi Nobusuke came to power and formed his cabinet in February of last year. Kishi Nobusuke's rise to power was enthusiastically supported by American and Japanese monopoly capital. American monopoly capital attempted to establish a pro-American, anti-communist reactionary regime in Japan through Kishi Nobusuke, in order to foster Japan as an accomplice to American aggression in Asia and a bridgehead for the American nuclear strategy system in the Far East. Japanese monopoly capital hoped to further rely on the United States through Kishi Nobusuke, and with the help of the United States, establish a new "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" composed of American capital, Japanese technology, and Southeast Asian resources, in order to realize its ambition of external expansion; internally, it aims to suppress the resistance of the Japanese people and further revive Japanese militarism. After Kishi Nobusuke came to power, he faithfully represented the interests of Japanese monopoly capital. He took advantage of the fact that American aggressive forces in Asia had to rely on Japan, demanding that the United States help Japan expand into Southeast Asia. At the same time, in order to win the trust of American imperialism, he showed hostility to the Chinese people, undermined Sino-Japanese friendship, and suppressed the Japanese people's struggle for peace, independence, and democracy, actively planning to revise the Japanese constitution in order to rearm and once again drag Japan onto an unfortunate path.

Since last year, Kishi Nobusuke's words and deeds of hostility towards our country have become increasingly intensified. In early June of last year, when Kishi Nobusuke visited Taiwan, he openly said to Chiang Kai-shek, "If we can recover the mainland, I think it would be very good." When the Third Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement expired in May of last year, the Kishi Nobusuke government first used the fingerprint issue as an excuse, and later used the issue of restricting the number of business representative offices to obstruct the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. In February of this year, under the strong criticism of the Japanese people and business circles, Kishi Nobusuke had no choice but to agree to the representatives of the three Japanese organizations coming to our country to sign the Fourth Trade Agreement, but at the same time, he created obstacles by proposing four "points of understanding," attempting to tamper with the draft agreement and memorandum that had been unanimously agreed upon by the representatives of China and Japan as early as October of last year. After the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was signed on March 5th of this year, Kishi Nobusuke issued a statement on the same day, stating that he could not recognize it. On April 9th, the Kishi Nobusuke government officially expressed its attitude of sabotaging the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. That is, the Japanese government is unwilling to provide guarantees for the safety and working convenience of Chinese business representative offices, and the Japanese government cannot recognize the right of Chinese business representative offices to display the Chinese national flag; thus, directly undermining the establishment of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Later, Kishi Nobusuke repeatedly said in Japanese election speeches: "The current government does not intend to take measures to break the deadlock in Japan-China trade," "I think it is a bit strange for people who say that trade cannot be conducted without displaying the national flag"; and also said: "We do not recognize Communist China, but we will find ways to expand trade with Communist China." More recently, the incident occurred where the Kishi Nobusuke government condoned Japanese thugs tearing down our national flag in Nagasaki.

These words and deeds of Kishi Nobusuke, which are hostile to our people, seriously violate the will of the majority of the Japanese people who want to be friendly with the Chinese people. For more than eight years, although the state of war between China and Japan has not yet ended, our people have made great efforts to promote Sino-Japanese friendly relations. There have been frequent and extensive contacts between the people of the two countries. The people of the two countries broke the conventions of international relations and signed more than 40 agreements through consultations between non-governmental organizations of the two countries, directly handling certain issues related to the common interests of the two countries. Our government has always welcomed and supported this friendly activity between the Chinese and Japanese people. Our government leaders have repeatedly met with representatives from all walks of life in Japan who have come to China for visits. Our government leaders have also visited Japanese commodity exhibitions held in our country. The Japanese commodity exhibitions held in various parts of our country not only displayed the Japanese national flag, but also its staff and trade representatives sent to China by Japanese manufacturers were given full security guarantees and all kinds of conveniences for their work. Therefore, the Japanese people and business figures have continuously sent letters, expressing their emotion and gratitude for the sincere and friendly attitude of our people and government in not dwelling on past grievances, and expressing their willingness to work together to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. However, Kishi Nobusuke and a small handful of anti-China reactionaries have used despicable and shameless means to respond to the sincerity shown by our people and government for Sino-Japanese friendship. This cannot but make the Chinese people feel unbearable.

We must sternly warn Kishi Nobusuke. First of all, if he takes the Chinese people's willingness to be friendly with the Japanese people as a manifestation of the Chinese people's weakness in fearing Japanese militarists, thereby thinking that China can be bullied, that can only show his own utter stupidity, and the result can only be shooting himself in the foot. Kishi Nobusuke should know that the old China, which was corrupt, succumbed to imperialism, and was powerless to resist aggression, is long gone. The current China not only absolutely does not allow others to invade it, but also has sufficient strength to repel any aggression against our country.

Secondly, if he regards the Sino-Japanese trade conducted by the Chinese people to promote Sino-Japanese friendship as a manifestation of China's dependence on Japan in production, that is also a big mistake. New China does not rely on any imperialism. Without imperialism, New China's economic development has not been hindered in any way; on the contrary, it has been further developed. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the backward face of old China is rapidly changing, and the speed of New China's socialist economic development is by no means imaginable by Japanese militarists. Although our economy has not yet developed to a higher level, there are no insurmountable difficulties in our economy. Even if Sino-Japanese trade is interrupted due to the obstruction of the reactionary factions of the Japanese ruling class, the development of our production will not be affected in any way. The idea that our production must rely on Sino-Japanese trade is obviously ridiculous.

Finally, if Kishi Nobusuke attempts to continue to adopt the shameful tactics of double-dealing in Sino-Japanese relations, then Sino-Japanese trade will definitely be undermined. As mentioned earlier, Sino-Japanese trade is based on the foundation of Sino-Japanese people's friendship. Kishi Nobusuke does not understand it this way. He regards trading with our country while being hostile to and insulting our people as a proud masterpiece, because this allows him to gain something from Sino-Japanese trade and also rip off the United States. However, Kishi Nobusuke's wishful thinking is wrong. If he insists on being hostile to the Chinese people to the end, then Kishi Nobusuke should bear full responsibility for the consequences of the obstruction of Sino-Japanese trade.

The Chinese people have friendly wishes towards the Japanese people. This was the case in the past, is the case now, and will not change in the future. However, Kishi Nobusuke and a small handful of anti-China reactionaries do not represent the will of the majority of the Japanese people. The Japanese people, progressive elements in the Japanese bourgeoisie, and even insightful people within the Liberal Democratic Party have always held attitudes towards Sino-Japanese relations that are different from those of Kishi Nobusuke. The Japanese Socialist Party and Communist Party put forward slogans in this election such as not recognizing two Chinas, quickly restoring diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, and promoting Sino-Japanese friendship. These slogans have won the support of the broad masses of the Japanese people. The broad masses of the Japanese people, mass organizations, and progressive parties have continuously criticized Kishi Nobusuke for implementing the policy of relying on the United States, being hostile to our country, and reviving Japanese militarism.

Now, the voice of the Japanese people demanding a change in the policy of hostility towards New China is growing day by day. At the same time, with the serious deterioration of the Japanese economy since last year and the inevitable impact of the deepening American economic crisis, where Japan should go has become a fundamental issue that Japan must seriously consider. Should it break free from American control and take the path of peace, independence, and democracy, or should it continue to follow the United States and take the path of reviving Japanese militarism? Which way to go? We believe that the broad masses of the Japanese people will make a wise choice.

### 再斥岸信介

　　再斥岸信介
    陈毅副总理兼外长在本月9日，向新华社记者发表谈话，严正指责日本岸信介政府敌视我国的行动，中国人民对这一谈话表示热烈的支持和拥护。
    日本的岸信介政府，在破坏了第四次中日贸易协定以后，又接着采取纵容日本暴徒扯下我国国旗的敌视我国人民的行动。中国人民对于岸信介这一损害我国国旗尊严和侮辱我国人民的挑衅行为，不能不再一次表示愤慨。
    岸信介敌视中国人民绝不是今天才开始的。早在1936年，岸信介就担任压迫和榨取我国东北人民的伪满洲国高级官吏，同侵略我国东北的日本关东军阀有很深的勾结。1941年10月，当日本帝国主义发动太平洋侵略战争的祸首、日本关东军阀首脑东条英机组织内阁的时候，岸信介出任商工大臣，以后又转任东条内阁军需省的军需次官。岸信介追随日本最富于侵略色彩的关东军阀的结果，不仅使他身败名裂，同时还给日本人民带来了深重的灾难。但是，岸信介并没有从中取得教训。时间过去还不久，现在他竟又妄图从追随美国、复活日本军国主义的老路中替日本垄断资本找寻出路，这真叫做江山易改，秉性难移。
    岸信介是在去年2月上台组阁的。岸信介的上台，曾获得美日垄断资本的热烈支持。美国垄断资本企图通过岸信介，在日本建立一个亲美反共的反动政权，以便把日本扶植成为美国侵略亚洲的帮凶和美国原子战略体系在远东的桥头堡。日本垄断资本妄图通过岸信介，对外进一步投靠美国，在美国的帮助下，建立由美国的资金、日本的技术和东南亚的资源构成的新的“大东亚共荣圈”，以实现它的向外扩张的野心；对内压制日本人民的反抗，进一步复活日本军国主义。岸信介上台以后，便忠实地代表了日本垄断资本的利益。他利用美国侵略势力在亚洲要依靠日本的这一点，要求美国帮助日本向东南亚扩张。同时，为了博得美国帝国主义对他的信任，他敌视中国人民，破坏中日友好和镇压日本人民争取和平、独立、民主的斗争，积极地筹划修改日本宪法，以便重整军备，再一次把日本拖上不幸的道路。
    去年以来，岸信介敌视我国的言行，已越来越变本加厉。去年6月初，岸信介访问台湾的时候，曾公开对蒋介石说：“如果能收复大陆的话，我认为是非常好的。”当去年5月第三次中日贸易协定满期以后，岸信介政府先借口指纹问题，后来又用限制商务代表机构人数的问题横加阻难，以致第四次中日贸易协定迟迟不能签订。今年2月，在日本人民和工商界的强烈指责下，岸信介不得不同意日本三团体代表来我国签订第四次贸易协定，但是同时又横生枝节地提出“谅解事项”四条，企图篡改早在去年10月由中日双方代表一致同意的协定草案和备忘录。第四次中日贸易协定在今年3月5日签订以后，岸信介在当天发表谈话，表示不能承认。到4月9日，岸信介政府正式表示了它破坏第四次中日贸易协定的态度。这就是日本政府对于中国商务代表机构的安全和工作便利，无意提供保证，日本政府不能承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂中国国旗；这样，就直接地破坏了第四次中日贸易协定的成立。以后，岸信介在日本竞选演说中口口声声地说：“目前政府不打算采取措施打开日中贸易的僵局”，“我认为，说不悬挂国旗就不能进行贸易的人，倒是有些奇怪”；又说：“不承认共产党中国，但是将设法扩大和共产党中国的贸易”。到最近，更发生了岸信介政府纵容日本暴徒在长崎扯下我国国旗的事件。
    岸信介这些敌视我国人民的言行，严重地违背了日本大多数人民要求同中国人民友好的意志。八年多以来，尽管中日两国之间的战争状态尚未结束，我国人民为促进中日友好关系作出了极大的努力。中日两国人民之间进行了频繁和广泛的接触。两国人民打破了国际关系的常规，通过两国民间性团体的协商，签订了四十多个协议，直接地处理了某些有关两国共同利益的问题。我国政府对于中日人民间这一友好活动，一直表示欢迎和支持。我国政府负责人曾经多次接见来中国访问的日本各方面代表。我国政府负责人也曾经参观日本在我国举办的商品展览会。日本在我国各地举行的商品展览会，不仅悬挂了日本国旗，而且它的工作人员和日本厂商派来中国的贸易代表，也都得到充分的安全保证和进行工作的种种方便。因此，日本人民和工商界人士曾经不断来信，对我国人民和政府的不念旧恶的真诚友好态度，表示感动和感谢，并且表示愿意共同为促进中日友好而努力。可是，岸信介和一小撮敌视中国的反动派，却采用卑鄙无耻的手法，来回答我国人民和政府对中日友好所表示的诚意。这不能不使中国人民感到忍无可忍。
    我们必须正告岸信介。首先，如果把中国人民愿意和日本人民友好的愿望，当作是中国人民惧怕日本军国主义者的怯弱的表现，从而以为中国可欺，那只能表现他自己的愚蠢透顶，其结果只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。岸信介应该知道，过去那种腐败的、向帝国主义屈服的、无力反抗侵略的旧中国，早已一去不复返了。现在的中国不仅绝不允许别人侵略，而且有充分的力量足以打退对我国的任何侵略。
    其次，如果把中国人民为促进中日友好而进行的中日贸易，看作是中国在生产上非依赖日本不可的表现，同样也是大错特错的。新中国不依靠任何帝国主义。没有帝国主义，新中国的经济发展不仅没有受到什么阻碍，相反，它得到了更大的发展。自从中华人民共和国成立以来，旧中国的落后面貌正在迅速地改变，新中国社会主义经济发展的速度决不是日本军国主义分子所能想像的。我国的经济虽然还没有发展到更高的水平，但是，在我国经济中并不存在什么不可克服的困难。即使中日贸易由于日本统治阶级反动派的百般阻碍而告中断，我国生产的发展也不会受到什么影响。认为我国生产非依靠中日贸易不可的想法，显然是十分可笑的。
    最后，岸信介如果企图继续在中日关系中采用两面三刀的可耻手法，那么，中日贸易肯定地要遭到破坏。正如前面所述，中日贸易是建立在中日人民友好的基础之上的。岸信介却不是这样理解。他把一面敌视和侮辱我国人民，一面又和我国贸易，看作是一种得意的杰作，因为这样既可以在中日贸易中捞一把，又可以向美国敲竹杠。不过岸信介这种如意算盘打错了。如果他一定要敌视中国人民到底，那么，岸信介应该对中日贸易遭受阻碍的后果担负全部责任。
    中国人民对于日本人民是有着友好的愿望的。过去和现在如此，将来也不会改变。但是，岸信介和一小撮敌视中国的反动派绝不代表日本大多数人民的意志。日本人民、日本资产阶级中的进步分子、以至自由民主党内部的有见识人士，对于中日关系一向抱着同岸信介有区别的态度。日本社会党、共产党在这次大选中提出了不承认两个中国、迅速同中华人民共和国恢复国交和增进中日友好等口号。这些口号获得了日本广大人民的拥护。日本广大人民、群众团体和进步党派，对于岸信介执行投靠美国、敌视我国和复活日本军国主义的政策，曾不断地提出指责。
    现在，日本人民要求改变敌视新中国的政策的呼声，正一天比一天增长。同时，随着去年以来日本经济的严重恶化和美国经济危机日趋深入的不可避免的影响，日本究竟往那里去，成为日本目前必须严重考虑的根本问题。是摆脱美国控制、走和平、独立和民主的道路呢，还是继续追随美国、走复活日本军国主义的道路呢？何去何从？我们相信，广大的日本人民是会作出明智的抉择的。
