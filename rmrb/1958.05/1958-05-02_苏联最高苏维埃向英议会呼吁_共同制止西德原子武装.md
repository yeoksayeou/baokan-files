Xinhua News Agency, May 1st dispatch: TASS reported on April 30th: The Chairman of the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Lobanov, and the Chairman of the National Council, Peive, wrote to the Speaker of the British House of Lords, Kilmuir, and the Speaker of the House of Commons, Morrison, appealing to the British Parliament to unite the efforts of the Soviet and British people to jointly prevent West Germany from arming its troops with atomic weapons, thereby consolidating peace and European security.

The letter emphasized that the West German Federal Parliament's decision to arm West German troops with atomic weapons happened to be passed during negotiations on convening a summit meeting. This is a direct challenge, the purpose of which is to hinder the success of the summit meeting.

The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union believes that adopting the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe would eliminate the danger of West German revanchist forces using destructive weapons and would establish a vast area of peace in Europe.

    苏联最高苏维埃向英议会呼吁
    共同制止西德原子武装
    据新华社1日讯　据塔斯社4月30日报道：苏联最高苏维埃联盟院主席洛巴诺夫和民族院主席佩维写信给英国上院议长基尔缪尔和下院议长摩里逊，呼吁英国议会把苏联和英国人民的努力联合起来，共同制止西德用原子武器武装军队，从而巩固和平和欧洲的安全。
    信中强调指出，西德联邦议院关于用原子武器武装西德军队的决定恰巧是在就召开最高级会议进行谈判的时候通过的，这是一个直接的挑战，其目的在于阻挠最高级会议的成功。
    苏联最高苏维埃认为，采纳波兰政府关于在中欧建立无原子武器区的建议，就会消除西德复仇主义势力使用毁灭性武器的危险，就会在欧洲建立一个广大的和平地区。
