    Thanks to the Medicine Sender from Afar
    My little girl suffered from "pinworm disease." After examination and treatment at Changchun Children's Hospital, it was not cured because the hospital did not have specific drugs and treatments for this disease.
    In mid-April, I wrote to the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, hoping they could recommend treatment methods.
    On May 2nd, I received a reply from the Department of Pediatrics of Peking Union Medical College Hospital. The letter not only told me about the transmission and prevention methods of this disease, but also bought and sent the better new drug "Pyrantel Pamoate" on my behalf. This spirit of caring for people's health and being responsible for work is really touching. I am writing this letter to express my heartfelt thanks.

    感谢千里送药人
    我有个小女孩因患了“蛲虫病”，经长春市儿童医院检查和治疗，因该院治这种病没有特效药物和疗法，一直没治好。
    4月中旬，我写信给中国医学科学研究所，希望他们能介绍治疗方法。
    5月2日我收到北京协和医院儿科学系的回信，信里不仅告诉了这种病的传播和防治方法，并代为买了较好的新药“驱虫宁”寄来。这种关心人民健康和对工作负责的精神，实在令人感动。特写此信表示衷心感谢。
