Implementing the Spirit of the General Line, Construction Begins Ahead of Schedule
Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Starts Expansion

Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The news of the victorious conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, and the General Line for Socialist Construction formulated by the Congress, have pushed the construction enthusiasm of the workers and staff of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, who are actively preparing for expansion, to a new peak. On the second day after the Congress concluded (May 24th), the plant's workers and staff immediately decided to officially start all the projects originally scheduled to begin in July and August on May 28th, ahead of schedule.

After the plant's Party Committee announced the decision to start the expansion project ahead of schedule to all employees on the 24th, more than 1,500 people from the entire plant participated in voluntary labor for the expansion on the 25th (Sunday), as a contribution before the expansion started.
