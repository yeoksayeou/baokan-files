    The experimental factory of the Wuchang Construction Engineering School of the Ministry of Construction Engineering has successfully trial-produced methane lamp nozzles using die-casting.

    This methane lamp nozzle is made of aluminum, which is much lighter than copper. It has only one brightness adjustment switch, which can make the air and methane mix evenly. The composition ratio is adjusted appropriately and conveniently, the gas burns completely, and the brightness is very high. It is stable and noise-free. The cost is very low, four times lower than the copper methane lamp nozzles already on the market, which is suitable for the needs of the majority of farmers. The use of die-casting improves work efficiency by 240 times compared to the original cutting method.

    The Hubei Provincial Department of Industry conducted a preliminary inspection and considered the product quality to be very good. Units from several provinces including Inner Mongolia, Shandong, and Hunan have come to the factory to visit and order. (Rong)

    沼气灯嘴
    建筑工程部武昌建筑工程学校的实习工厂，用压铸法试制沼气灯嘴已经成功。
    这种沼气灯嘴是改用铝制的，质量比铜质轻得多，上面只用一个亮度调节开关，能使空气和沼气混合均匀，成分比调节适当而方便，气体燃烧完全，亮度很高，既安定又无噪音。成本很低，比市面已出现的铜质沼气灯嘴降低了四倍，适合广大农民的需要。使用压铸法后比原来切削法提高工效二百四十倍。
    湖北省工业厅初步检查，认为产品质量很好。已有内蒙古、山东、湖南好几个省的一些单位来该厂参观和订制。　（容）
