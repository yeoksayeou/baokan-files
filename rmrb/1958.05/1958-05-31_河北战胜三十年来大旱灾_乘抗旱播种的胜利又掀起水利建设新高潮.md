    Hebei Province Overcomes Thirty-Year Drought
    Riding the Victory of Drought-Resistant Planting, a New Upsurge in Water Conservancy Construction is Launched
    Our newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, May 30th: The broad masses of people in Hebei Province, with unparalleled perseverance and vigor, fought hard for forty days and overcame the worst drought in nearly thirty years, winning a tremendous victory in drought-resistant planting. Currently, out of the province's more than 85 million mu of spring arable land, 76.8 million mu have been sown. Except for sweet potatoes and rice, which are being rushed into planting, crops such as cotton, corn, sorghum, and millet have all completed or exceeded their planting plans. The seedlings of the crops that were planted earlier have already emerged from the soil and are generally growing strong.
    From last winter to this spring, Hebei Province had not had a thorough rain for more than 270 days. Of the province's more than 85 million mu of spring arable land to be planted, more than 40 million mu were lacking moisture, including more than 13 million mu that were severely lacking moisture and also lacked water conservancy facilities. Relevant historical data shows that from 1368 to 1956, a period of 588 years, Hebei Province experienced a total of 137 major and severe droughts. This year's drought is the worst since 1928. However, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of the liberated people. Under the leadership of party organizations at all levels, the people of the province pooled their wisdom and strength, and with the revolutionary heroic spirit of overwhelming force and magnificent momentum, after more than a month of day and night hard work, not only completed the drought-resistant planting task, but also planted earlier, faster, and better than in previous years.

    Our newspaper's Tianjin dispatch, May 30th: Since mid-May, the peasants of Hebei Province, riding the wave of victory over the drought, have once again launched a new upsurge in water conservancy construction, striving to expand the irrigated land to 100 million mu, basically achieve water conservancy ahead of schedule, and ensure a bumper harvest in agricultural production.
    Since last winter, Hebei Province has been vigorously engaged in water conservancy construction, and many places have already formed a water conservancy network with interconnected canals and reservoirs, and linked pits and ponds. As of May 7, the area of irrigated land had been expanded to more than 84 million mu, accounting for more than 67% of the province's cultivated land area. Among them, more than 57 million mu of irrigated land was newly expanded since last winter. However, the water conservancy projects during this period mainly utilized surface water. However, Hebei Province had not had a thorough rain for more than 270 days since last winter, resulting in a lack of surface water and the worst drought in nearly thirty years. In order to completely overcome the drought and ensure "planting is guaranteed even if it doesn't rain in spring, and a bumper harvest is guaranteed even if it doesn't rain all year round," the emergency drought resistance meeting of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Secretaries held on May 7th and 8th issued a new call to the people of the province: continue to vigorously develop water conservancy, expand the irrigated land to 100 million mu, and ensure that there will be no disasters when it rains, and a bumper harvest is guaranteed when it does not.
    Under this new call, various localities immediately discussed and formulated new plans for further carrying out the water conservancy construction campaign. In addition to continuing to build reservoirs, canals, and other projects to provide water storage, they also focused on vigorously tapping underground water sources. The three special districts of Tangshan, Cangxian, and Xingtai have recently invested more than 2.4 million laborers in water conservancy construction, an increase of more than 1 million compared to the previous period. In mid-May, Baoding Special District launched a 40-day water conservancy assault campaign, planning to sink 120,000 cone wells, drill 10,000 machine wells, and dig 60,000 brick wells and large wells each, to eliminate the 3 million mu of dry land that has water conservancy equipment but no water source, or has a water source but no water conservancy equipment. Chengde Special District launched a comprehensive offensive against underground and surface water, planning to complete more than 7,000 small and medium-sized reservoirs, open more than 12,000 canals, and dig more than 9,000 water cellars and ponds before the flood season, in addition to drilling 100,000 wells and digging 90,000 springs, so that the irrigated land in the whole region will be further developed by 1.5 million to 2 million mu on the basis of the newly developed 2.3 million mu.
    In order to vigorously develop underground water sources, many places have carried out deep cone operations on existing wells, pits, and ponds, and continued to carry out activities such as finding and digging springs. The province originally planned to open springs and divert water at 500 cubic meters per second, which could irrigate 5 million mu of rice fields or 20 million mu of dry land. Now, in addition to completing the digging of more than 100,000 springs and achieving a water output of more than 240 cubic meters per second, various localities are continuing to carry out spring-finding and spring-digging activities.
    Building terraced wells, repairing ring-mountain canals, and digging mountain springs to turn mountain slopes into irrigated land are the goals of the people in mountainous areas. More than 30,000 migrant workers in Shexian County are creating a miracle on the waist of the Taihang Mountains and the upper reaches of the Qingzhang River to move river water to the mountains, where they will build four large aqueducts with a total length of 350 li, passing through 34 mountain tunnels, and crossing hundreds of mountain gullies and ridges to draw Qingzhang River water to irrigate 125,000 mu of mountain land. This project started in January this year and was originally scheduled to be completed in four years. However, in order to realize mountain land water conservancy as soon as possible and demand more grain from the mountain land, people decided to complete the four-year plan in two years, and then changed it to one year, and are now striving to complete it before the flood season this year.
    While vigorously developing underground water sources, the construction and renovation of small and medium-sized reservoirs and canals has not been relaxed in order to store water sources and prevent floods and waterlogging. For the small and medium-sized reservoirs alone, there are now more than 6,900 under construction in the province, and they will generally be completed before the flood season. (Deng Zichang)

    河北战胜三十年来大旱灾
    乘抗旱播种的胜利又掀起水利建设新高潮
    本报天津30日电　河北省广大人民以无比的毅力和干劲，苦战四十天，战胜了近三十年来的一次最大旱灾，赢得了抗旱播种的巨大胜利。目前，全省八千五百多万亩春白地，已有七千六百八十万亩播上了种，除了甘薯、水稻正突击播种外，棉花、玉米、高粱、谷子等农作物都已完成或超额完成种植计划。现在播种较早的庄稼幼苗已经出土，一般生育健壮。
    去冬今春，河北省曾有二百七十多天没下透雨，全省八千五百多万亩要播种的春白地，有四千多万亩失墒，其中失墒严重而又缺乏水利条件的达一千三百多万亩。有关历史资料表明：从1368年到1956年的五百八十八年间，河北省共发生过一百三十七次特大干旱和大旱灾害。今年的旱情是1928年以来所没有过的大旱。但是，在解放了的人民面前没有克服不了的困难。全省人民在各级党组织的领导下，群策群力，以排山倒海、气壮山河的革命英雄气概，经过一个多月的昼夜鏖战，不仅完成了抗旱播种任务，而且比往年播种的更早、更快、更好。

    本报天津30日电　从5月中旬以来，河北省农民乘压倒干旱的胜利之风，再一次掀起了水利建设新高潮，力争要把水浇地扩大到一亿亩，提前基本实现水利化，确保农业生产大丰收。
    去冬以来，河北省即大兴水利建设，不少地方已形成了渠道水库相通、坑塘相连的水利网。到5月7日止，水浇地面积已扩大到八千四百多万亩，占全省耕地面积的67％以上。其中，只去冬以来新扩大的水浇地，即有五千七百多万亩。然而，这一时期的水利工程，主要是利用地上水。可是河北省从去冬起遇到二百七十多天没有下过透雨，地上水缺乏，出现了近三十年来所没有过的干旱。为了彻底战胜干旱，作到“一春不雨保播种，全年不雨保丰收”。5月7、8日召开的中共河北省地委书记紧急抗旱会议，又向全省人民提出了新的号召：继续大力开发水利，扩大水浇地到一亿亩，作到有雨不成灾，无雨保丰收。
    在这一新的号召下，各地立即纷纷讨论制订出进一步开展水利建设运动的新计划，除了继续兴建水库、渠道等提供蓄水的工程外，更着重大力挖掘地下水源。唐山、沧县和邢台三个专区，最近投入水利建设的劳力达到了二百四十多万人，比前一时期增多一百万人以上。保定专区5月中旬开展了一个四十天的水利突击运动，计划锥井十二万眼，打机井一万眼，打砖井和大井各六万眼，要把有水利设备而无水源和有水源而无水利设备的三百万亩旱地消灭光。承德专区发动了向地下水和地上水的全面进攻，计划在汛期前除完成小型和中型水库七千多座，开渠一万二千多条，挖水窖和水池九千多个外，还要打井十万眼，挖泉九万个，把全区水浇地在新发展的二百三十多万亩的基础上，再发展一百五十万到二百万亩。
    为了大力开发地下水源，许多地方对已有的水井、水坑和水塘进行了深锥，并继续开展了找泉凿泉等活动。全省原计划开泉引水五百秒公方，可使五百万亩稻田或二千万亩旱地得到灌溉。现在，各地除已完成凿泉十万多眼，出水量已达到二百四十多秒公方外，还在继续进行找泉凿泉活动。
    打梯田井、修环山渠和凿山泉，把山坡地变成水浇地，是山区人民的奋斗目标。涉县有三万多民工正在太行山腰、清漳河上游创造着要把河水搬上山去的奇迹，他们要在这里修四条全长三百五十里、穿过三十四个山洞、翻越百数十道山沟山岭的大水渠窑引清漳河水上山浇地十二万五千亩。这项工程是今年1月开工的，原订四年完成，但是人们为了早日实现山地水利化，向山地多要粮食，决定四年计划二年完成，后又改为一年完成，现正争取在今年汛期以前就要完成。
    在大力开发地下水源同时，并没有放松对中小型水库渠道的兴建与整修。以便蓄水源和防洪防涝。只小型和中型水库一项，全省现在正紧张施工的即有六千九百多座，一般都将在汛前竣工。（邓子常）
