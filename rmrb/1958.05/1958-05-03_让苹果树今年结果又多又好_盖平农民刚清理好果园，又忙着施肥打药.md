To Make Apple Trees Bear More and Better Fruit This Year
　　Gaiping Farmers, Having Just Cleaned Up Their Orchards, Are Busy Fertilizing and Spraying

　　(Our Dispatch) The apple blossoms in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, a major apple-producing area, are budding. Tens of thousands of farmers in the county who manage orchards have just finished scraping the bark of the apple trees, hoeing around the tree roots, fertilizing, and cleaning the orchards. Now, they are engaged in many busy tasks such as preventing and controlling various pests, spraying pesticides, irrigating the apple trees, applying topdressing fertilizer, and repairing terraced fields.

　　Gaiping County produced 56,000 tons of apples last year, accounting for more than a quarter of the country's total apple production. This year, the county plans to reach a total apple production of 95,000 tons.

　　In Gaiping County, 70% of the county's 1.9 million apple trees are planted on hillsides and thin land. The soil layer in these areas is mostly composed of friable stone, gravel, and sandy soil, resulting in very poor soil quality. Consequently, the crowns of the apple trees are generally small, and apple fruitlet drop increases annually. The apples lost due to this issue account for 15% of the county's total apple production each year. This year, the county's farmers have designated addressing this situation as an important measure to improve apple quality, universally implementing water and soil conservation and soil cultivation. It is estimated that by the end of May, water and soil erosion will be controlled for the hillside land with more than 700,000 trees. After the thaw, various communes have also universally started implementing the digging of tree pits and the exchange of topsoil and subsoil in the soil cultivation projects. This will directly contribute to filling organic matter, enhancing tree vigor, expanding tree crowns, reducing apple fruitlet drop, and improving apple yield and quality. In addition, it is planned that apples in the county will be sprayed eight times this year to ensure pests are eliminated as they occur and resolutely prevent the spread of pests.

    让苹果树今年结果又多又好
    盖平农民刚清理好果园，又忙着施肥打药
    本报讯　盛产苹果的辽宁省盖平县，果花正在含苞待放。全县数万经营果树的农民，刚刚结束上一阶段的刮果树曝皮、刨树盘、施肥和清扫果园工作，现在又投入了防治各种虫害、打药、果树灌溉、施追肥和修梯田等许多繁忙的劳动。
    盖平县去年产苹果五万六千吨，占全国苹果总产量四分之一以上，今年，全县计划苹果总产量达到九万五千吨。
    盖平县全县一百九十万棵苹果结果树中，70％都是栽在山坡和薄地上，这些地土层为酥石硼、砂砾土多，土质很坏，因此果树冠普遍很小，缩果病逐年增加。每年损失在这上面的苹果，就占全县苹果总产量15％。今年，全县农民把改变这种情况列为实现提高苹果质量的一项重要措施，普遍进行了水土保持和土壤熟化工作。预计到5月底能把有树七十多万棵的坡地都控制住水土流失。土壤熟化工程中的放树窝子、里表土倒换，解冻以后各社也普遍开始行动了，这对填充有机质、增强树势、扩大树冠、减少缩果病，提高苹果产量和质量都将起到直接的作用。此外，全县苹果今年计划普遍要打八次药，做到虫害随发生，随消灭，坚决制止虫害蔓延。
