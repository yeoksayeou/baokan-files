    Realism or Revisionism?
    Lin Mohan
    Echoing the international trend of revisionist thought, revisionist literary ideas have also been quite fashionable in our country in the past two years. The first to jump on the bandwagon was Qin Zhaoyang. During this period, he wrote many articles with revisionist tendencies under various pen names. Among them, "Realism - A Broad Road," published under the name He Zhi in the September 1956 issue of "People's Literature," can be said to be a systematic revisionist literary program.
    Like all revisionists at home and abroad, Qin Zhaoyang appeared under the banner of opposing dogmatism. In reality, he was attacking the fundamental principles of Marxism in literature under the guise of opposing dogmatism. He negated socialist realism, opposed the idea that writers should have a socialist spirit, opposed literature serving revolutionary politics, and negated the critical standard of "politics first." He advocated "human nature theory," opposed examining literary phenomena from a class perspective, advocated "exposing the dark side of life," and advocated "intervening in life" according to bourgeois views. He also used his position at "People's Literature" to implement his revisionist literary line, publishing a large number of poisonous weeds in the magazine, not to prepare for criticism, but to promote them as fragrant flowers, some of which were even modified by him to strengthen their toxicity. Liu Binyan, who became famous for exposing the "darkness" of the new society, was handpicked by Qin Zhaoyang. For a time, many right-wingers and revisionists regarded Qin Zhaoyang as their banner and enthusiastically applauded his revisionist literary program. The "club journal" "Explorer," which a group of right-wingers in Nanjing were preparing to launch, took Qin Zhaoyang's "program" as its aim. Qin Zhaoyang's literary ideas did play a role in inciting evil winds in China's literary circles for a time, and its influence cannot be ignored. Therefore, although many comrades have exposed and criticized Qin Zhaoyang's mistakes from various aspects, it is still necessary to continue to carry out a more systematic criticism of his revisionist literary "theory." This article focuses on analyzing the essence of his revisionist literary thought based on the three issues raised in his article "Realism - A Broad Road": socialist realism, the relationship between art and politics, and the typical.
    In the past two years, bourgeois writers in various countries and revisionists at home and abroad have unanimously attacked socialist realism, with the aim of not only opposing socialist literature, but also opposing the socialist system. They say that socialist realism has led to the "decline" of literature, that it shackles the writer's freedom of creation, and that the new socialist life reflected in socialist realist literature is false and embellishes reality. From this, the conclusion is inevitably drawn: socialist society hinders the development of literature; in socialist society, writers do not have the freedom to write; socialist society is not as beautiful and worthy of pursuit as it is portrayed in socialist realist literature. This is the real goal that the bourgeoisie and revisionists want to achieve. Therefore, opposing socialist realism or defending socialist realism is not only a matter of artistic thought, but also a matter of political significance.
    Qin Zhaoyang attacks socialist realism by questioning the definition of socialist realism. However, what he opposes is not only the definition of socialist realism itself, but, starting from here, he attempts to fundamentally negate socialist realist literature, which is actually the same as some foreign revisionists who regard socialist realism as something fabricated by a few people. However, socialist realist literature is by no means something fabricated out of thin air. It is a new type of literature that inevitably arises under certain historical conditions. It is not the definition that determines its existence, but its existence that produces the definition about it. Before theoretically explaining this kind of literature, it had already appeared in the world with a brand new attitude. Socialist realist literature was born when the working class had become a conscious social force on the historical stage, and in the struggle of the people to realize socialist ideals. As everyone knows, at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the center of the world revolutionary movement had shifted to Russia. The Russian working class held a heroic armed uprising in 1905, and the political education received by the workers and peasants during the years of the revolution was richer than that received in ordinary decades. The new reality, the new struggle, and the new nature of people's thoughts and feelings must be reflected in literature, giving literature new ideological content, and at the same time, it cannot but demand changes and innovations in artistic methods. It was when the 1905 revolution was in full swing that Lenin published the classic article "Party Organization and Party Literature," which clearly defined the fundamental principles of proletarian literature. In 1907, Gorky's novel "Mother" was published, which is generally recognized as the foundational work of socialist realism. It is clear that Russia became the birthplace of Leninism and also the birthplace of socialist realism. This is by no means accidental. The victory of socialism in the Soviet Union and many countries has provided broader conditions for the development of socialist realism. Today, the creative principles of socialist realism have been accepted by many progressive writers in the world. A new type of literary team is growing stronger day by day. On the banner of socialist realism, we can find the names of many world-renowned outstanding writers. This is an ironclad fact that no one can erase.
    The development of socialist realist literary creation to a certain stage will inevitably require theoretical generalization and interpretation, and therefore the definition of socialist realism has emerged. Whether the definition is perfect is entirely open to discussion. No definition can encompass all the characteristics of a phenomenon. It is inherently difficult to summarize a complex literary phenomenon in a few simple sentences. With the increasing development of socialist realist literature and the increasing richness of creative practice, it may be necessary to make new additions or modifications to its definition. But does that mean that the existence and development of socialist realist literature itself can be denied? Denying the objective existence of socialist realist literature is just a idealistic fantasy, just as Qin Zhaoyang is unwilling to admit that he is a revisionist, but the revisionist Qin Zhaoyang does exist.
    In our country, the revolutionary literary movement occurred under the influence of the October Revolution, and it was led by communist thought from the beginning. With the development of the workers' movement and the socialist ideological movement, the socialist tendency of revolutionary literature became increasingly strong. The creative principles of socialist realism were quickly accepted by many progressive writers in our country. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" affirmed the creative principles of socialist realism and gave this principle a scientific Marxist generalization and interpretation, fundamentally solving the problem of literature and art serving the people and how to serve them, and solving the relationship between the writer's worldview and creation, making the principles of socialist realism more clear and rich.
    Why does Qin Zhaoyang oppose socialist realism? The most important reason is that socialist realism advocates that our literature must shoulder the task of educating the people with a socialist spirit. Qin Zhaoyang believes that requiring literature to educate the people with a socialist spirit "is tantamount to saying that objective truth is not absolutely worthy of attention, and that more important is a certain fixed abstract 'socialist spirit' and desire in the writer's mind. When necessary, the objective truth that is alive and vibrant must submit to this abstract and fixed subjective thing. As a result, it is very likely that literary works will deviate from objective truth and even become a megaphone for certain political concepts." What strange logic! Why would a writer's socialist spirit make him unfaithful to objective truth? Is it that a writer lacks a socialist spirit, or is full of bourgeois ideas, is better able to be faithful to objective truth? In Qin Zhaoyang's view, a writer's socialist spirit will not only not help the writer to better understand objective truth, but on the contrary, will hinder the writer from reflecting objective truth. He believes that if a writer has a socialist spirit, he will "forcibly add something to realism itself," and will "let a certain 'spirit' - a certain idea or desire - deviate from the truth of art and become purely abstract, and in turn use it to act on and change the truth of art." What to do? To have a socialist spirit is to violate truth; to have truth is to not have a socialist spirit. Truth and the socialist spirit were originally incompatible. And truth is the life of literature and art, therefore, the socialist spirit is a very hateful thing that destroys literature and art. This is the inevitable conclusion of Qin Zhaoyang's logic.
    Of course, Qin Zhaoyang opposes the need for writers to have a socialist spirit, and the technique he adopts is relatively clever. He says: The socialist spirit "exists in the truth of life and the truth of art." That is to say, there is originally a socialist spirit in life. As long as the writer truthfully describes life, his works will naturally have a socialist spirit. As for whether the writer himself has a socialist spirit, that is irrelevant. If there is such a spirit, it will be harmful, because in that way, the writer will "harden a kind of abstract conceptual thing in his mind" and "add it to the work," and the work will not be true. Is that really the case? We want to ask: Why is it that Qin Zhaoyang's works of Liu Binyan and others, which he considers "true," do not have a socialist spirit in them, but only an anti-socialist spirit? We also want to ask: Why does Qin Zhaoyang use his real name to write essays and novels, talking about socialism, but uses other pen names to write articles, opposing the socialist spirit? Why does Qin Zhaoyang, as an editor, modify Wang Meng's novels, strengthening the negative factors of the novels, and then, as a critic, publicly criticize Wang Meng, and what he accuses is exactly what you have modified? Why is this? It turns out that Qin Zhaoyang is one thing in public and another in private. His "socialist spirit" is fake, used to decorate the facade. No wonder he wants to "harden it into the work." It can be seen that it is not that the socialist spirit and truth are contradictory, but that the socialist spirit is true and false, and the hypocritical "socialist spirit" of Qin Zhaoyang and others is of course contrary to the truth of socialist society.
    The relationship between worldview and creative method has always been a controversial topic. Bourgeois writers and new and old revisionists at home and abroad have tried to prove that there is no relationship between the writer's worldview and their creative method. They believe that the reactionary or backwardness of the writer's worldview will not only not affect his observation and understanding of the truth of life, but even imply that the more reactionary the writer's worldview, the better the work, and the more able to reflect objective truth. Although Qin Zhaoyang had to admit in words that the creative method "is influenced and restricted by the worldview," he essentially negated the role of the worldview in the creative method. He regarded the realistic creative method as a purely expressive technique that seems to have nothing to do with the writer's ideological position. No matter what the writer's thoughts are, as long as he grasps this "method," he can write objective truth. Zhou Bo, who followed Qin Zhaoyang and published an article "On Realism and Its Development in the Socialist Era" in the December issue of "Changjiang Literature and Art" of the same year, said it more bluntly. He said: "Because the realistic creative method is the crystallization of a rich accumulation of experience in artistic creation, no matter how high it develops and how its creative conditions change, from the perspective of the artistic creative method itself, there should be no changes..." Another Zheng Xiuzi said more simply: "The so-called creative method, to a large extent, is just a matter of pure means of expression." They separate the creative method from the writer's worldview and regard artistic creation as a thoughtless activity. However, can creation be carried out without thought? How a writer expresses life depends first on how he observes life and how he understands life. In the process of a writer observing life and understanding life, he is inevitably guided and influenced by his worldview. Of course, on the other hand, in the practice of life, the worldview also changes from time to time. We believe that the worldview cannot replace the creative method, nor can we say that as long as there is a correct worldview, good works can be written. Artistic creation requires many other conditions. However, the worldview is always the soul of the creative method. It always gives the creative method a positive or negative influence, not only affecting the author's view of life, but also affecting the author's artistic skills and expressive ability. For today's writers, obtaining the proletarian standpoint and the Marxist worldview is a matter of decisive significance for their creation. The true intention of revisionists at home and abroad in trying to deny the role and significance of the writer's worldview in artistic creation is to use this to oppose promoting the Marxist worldview to writers and deny the guiding role of the Marxist worldview in creation. Qin Zhaoyang's opposition to the writer's socialist spirit is nothing more than this purpose.
    Since Qin Zhaoyang negates the role and significance of the worldview in the creative method, he will inevitably regard realism as something that can develop independently from the era environment and social trends. In his view, realism is like a train, moving forward station by station. No matter how time and the environment change, the train is still that train, and realism is still the same old unchanging "realism." Starting from this point of view, he naturally obliterated the essential difference between socialist realism and past realism. Qin Zhaoyang said: "It is difficult to draw an absolutely different line between the literature of the new and old eras from the content characteristics of realistic literature." (Emphasis in original) Zhou Bo said more bluntly: "There is no and cannot be any difference in creative methods between realism in the pre-socialist era and realism in the socialist era." Therefore, they all unanimously negated socialist realism and advocated replacing socialist realism with "realism in the socialist revolutionary era."
    Qin Zhaoyang should know that no matter in the world can have "absolute" boundaries. Day and night, life and death, light and darkness, who can find the "absolute boundary" between them? However, this does not deny the different characteristics of various things, nor does it deny the essential differences of various things. "For objective dialectics, there is absolute in the relative. For subjectivism and sophistry, the relative is only relative, and it excludes the absolute." (See Lenin: "Philosophical Notebooks") Using subjective sophistry to blur the boundaries of things is an important characteristic of revisionists. In politics, they blur the boundaries between socialism and capitalism, confuse the distinction between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and even believe that in capitalist society, the opposition between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie no longer exists. In literature and art, they obliterate the difference between socialist realism and old realism, and blur the boundaries between socialist literature and art and bourgeois literature and art. Whether they themselves admit it or not, their purpose in doing so is to help the bourgeoisie consolidate the capitalist system, to relieve the proletariat of its fighting will to resist capitalist exploitation, and to weaken the influence of socialist thought on the working people.
    We believe that socialist realism has an essential difference from past realism, but we do not deny the relationship of inheritance between them. In fact, today's bourgeois writers have long abandoned the excellent traditions of past realism. In the capitalist world, many great classical writers have been slandered, while the "paintings" of orangutans have become fashionable. Only the proletariat truly cherishes and inherits all the excellent achievements of human culture. Socialist realism inherits the excellent traditions of past realism, but it is also a kind of innovative art that is completely different from old realism. The ideological basis of socialist realism is scientific socialism, while the ideological basis of old realism is generally democracy and humanitarianism. The innovation of socialist realism is reflected in the fact that it not only regards the life and struggle of the working people as an important theme of the work, but also truly reveals the active role of the masses in social development: the working people are not, as in past literature, only described as supporting roles or backgrounds of social events, but have become the center of the picture and the protagonists on the stage; they are not expressed as objects of sympathy and pity, but as the masters and creators of life. It is precisely because socialist realist literature affirms the main position of the masses in life and art that socialist realist literature has a powerful inspiring force, can inspire people to transform life and change the world, and fill people with hope and confidence for the future. Only socialist realism, which reflects reality from the development of the revolution, can fully express the new factors in life and the great ideals and heroic spirit of the people. Our life has ideals, and ideals are rooted in the soil of life. Our reality is heroic and full of romantic miracles. Socialist realism is precisely the organic combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. However, old realistic literature often can only expose the darkness and sins of society, cannot further find out the root causes of this darkness and sin, and cannot find new forces sufficient to overcome this evil force, and therefore cannot point out the way forward for people. Some of these works are often tinged with skepticism or pessimism. It is not that there are no positive and positive forces in life, but mainly because of the ideological limitations of the old realist writers themselves that they cannot see this force. Therefore, this kind of literature cannot have a strong role in inspiring progress. There is often (this is to say not completely) a gap between old realism and romanticism: realism only sees the ugly reality, while romanticism is obsessed with beautiful illusions. How can we say that socialist realist literature is not essentially different from old realistic literature? It is obvious that the purpose of Qin Zhaoyang and others in trying to obliterate the differences between these two kinds of literature is to negate socialist realist literature and to replace socialist literature with bourgeois literature.
    Qin Zhaoyang also said: "The so-called old realism is not absolutely just critical realism." At the same time, he opposed the view that "socialist realism is the opposite of old realism, it 'is only affirmative realism,' and is not also critical realism" (emphasis in original). It is true that it is one-sided and wrong to think that old realism is only critical and affirms nothing, or to think that socialist realism is only affirmative and criticizes nothing. This statement is not in line with the actual situation of these two kinds of literary phenomena. The mistake of this statement has already been pointed out by others. However, if it is said that old realism mainly criticizes the darkness of the old society, and socialist realism vigorously affirms the brightness of the new society while criticizing the old society, this statement is in line with the actual situation and is not wrong. It is the same to both affirm and criticize, and what is affirmed and criticized has the same places and different places. Old realism criticizes the old unreasonable social system, and what it sympathizes with is the victims or "superfluous people" under the unreasonable social system, regardless of whether the author himself is aware of it; but because it cannot see or cannot fully see the new social forces that can be affirmed, the criticism of the old society is often incomplete. Socialist realism, on the other hand, carries out the most thorough criticism of the old social system, and at the same time affirms and praises the new socialist system with unparalleled enthusiasm, because this system is the most advanced and in line with the interests of millions of people. Its criticism is also to protect the socialist system, to combat the enemies who destroy the socialist system, and to transform things that hinder the progress of the socialist cause. Socialist realist writers consciously shoulder this noble and sacred mission. Is this not an obvious difference? This difference is caused by the difference in the times or social environment in which the two different writers are located and their ideological positions. Anyone who cannot see or is unwilling to see this difference will make mistakes and may even go down the road of anti-Party and anti-socialism. Because in that way they may use the methods of dealing with the old society to deal with the new society, and regard exposing the so-called "darkness" of the new society as the main task of literature. Qin Zhaoyang, Liu Binyan and others have fallen into revisionists and right-wingers in this way.
    Let us take a look at what is "realism in the socialist revolutionary era"? This is a very general concept. We know that since capitalism entered the stage of imperialism, especially after the October Revolution, the world entered the era of socialist revolution. In this era, there are various realistic writers. Not to mention the situation in socialist countries, let's take today's capitalist world as an example. There are Aragon, Neruda, Amado, Hikmet and other world-renowned writers who adhere to the creative principles of socialist realism; but there are also other writers, such as Lewis, Hemingway, Thomas Mann, Merlin, Remarque, etc. (some of them passed away not long ago). They should also be said to be realistic writers. Their works often truthfully reflect the various sins and sufferings of capitalist society and are conducive to the struggle against capitalism. In this regard, they are our allies. However, their works and socialist realist works are significantly different in terms of ideology, description objects, and the role they play for readers. This is an undeniable fact. How can we use the general concept of "realism in the socialist revolutionary era" to confuse these two obviously different literary phenomena?
    We believe that socialist realism is the best creative method, but not the only creative method. It is not in line with the actual situation to regard socialist realism as the only creative method in the socialist era. In that way, it will only either exclude everything, making socialist realism a narrow sectarian thing; or it will be downgraded to include all writers in the category of socialist realism. We advocate socialist realism, but what creative method each writer adopts can only be based on his own free will and cannot be forced. We say that socialist realism is the best because it takes the most advanced Marxism as its guiding ideology. However, this does not mean that as long as there is socialist realism, the best works will inevitably be written, because the success or failure of artistic creation is not only determined by its creative method, but it also has many other factors. The method cannot replace the writer's artistic talent, nor can it replace the writer's life experience. Therefore, it is not surprising that some non-excellent works are sometimes produced in socialist realist writers. What era and what kind of art school has not produced many mediocre works? The revisionists deliberately obliterate many outstanding works in socialist realist literature, and cite some second-rate works or imitations of socialist realism as a pretext for attacking socialist realism, which is only enough to show their prejudice and lack of skills.
    The relationship between literature and art and politics is the focus of the struggle between the two lines of proletarian literature and art and bourgeois literature and art, and it is also one of the fundamental differences between us and the revisionists. The proletariat openly declares that the proletarian literature and art is a part of the proletarian revolutionary cause and serves the revolutionary politics. The bourgeoisie dares not openly admit that their literature and art serves their class interests. They use the banner of "art for art's sake" to conceal the political purpose of their art. In fact, "art for art's sake" is serving the political interests of the bourgeoisie. The revisionists also try to abolish the principle of literature and art serving politics. They do not openly put forward the slogan of "art for art's sake," but use the arguments of "art is politics" and one-sided emphasis on "artistic quality" to achieve the purpose of abolishing the service of art for revolutionary politics. In fact, they are secretly helping the bourgeoisie.
    Qin Zhaoyang said: "Serving politics and serving the working people are raising issues from a political perspective. It should be a part of the writer's worldview, but it is also a requirement for realistic literature to move towards greater perfection - to further improve its awareness of reality and art." It turns out that "serving politics and serving the working people" is only "a part" of the writer's worldview. Then, what is "a part" or "most of it"? Besides serving the working people, who else does it serve? May I ask Qin Zhaoyang to reveal the bottom line to everyone? In fact, his "bottom line" is "serving the bourgeoisie," but he is not easy to say it directly. Comrade Mao Zedong said that the question of "for whom is a fundamental question, a matter of principle." The writer's worldview is the sum of his various views, but for revolutionary writers, serving the working people and serving revolutionary politics are the basis of his worldview, the most fundamental thing, and not an dispensable "part." Here, Qin Zhaoyang attempts to oppose art and politics, as if art serving politics and serving the working people would hinder its "greater perfection." In his view, literature and art serving politics and serving the working people is a last resort, because this is "raising the issue from a political perspective," and there is no way to openly reject it!
    In the past, the "third kind of people" attacked us, saying that we were "utilitarians of the present moment," saying that revolutionary literature and art were political "gramophones." The same meaning, with a different statement, is now spoken from Qin Zhaoyang's mouth. Qin Zhaoyang also believes that our literature and art is a "megaphone for political concepts" that "only cares about the political propaganda tasks at hand." He put forward a statement that "literature and art serving politics and serving the people should be a long-term general requirement" to oppose the service of literature and art "serving the current political tasks," which essentially abolishes the service of literature and art for revolutionary politics. Literature and art educates the people by vividly reflecting life. It is different from general propaganda and should not require literature and art to mechanically interpret a certain policy provision. However, this particularity of literature and art does not prevent it from serving the current political tasks. In fact, all great writers have always dedicated themselves to the urgent struggles of the time. A person who is indifferent and unresponsive to the current struggle of the people, how can he write works with "long-term significance"? Gorky's famous work "Mother," which Qin Zhaoyang believes to be "of long-term social significance," was precisely written by the author for the needs of the revolutionary struggle at that time. At that time, it was also attacked by many bourgeois critics, saying that it was propaganda rather than art. It was Lenin who came out to defend this novel, praising it as "the most timely book." Lu Xun's rebuttal of the "third kind of people" at that time can also be used to rebut Qin Zhaoyang. Lu Xun said: "The left wing also wants Tolstoy and Flaubert. But not the Tolstoy and Flaubert who 'try hard to create something that belongs to the future (because they don't want it now).' Both of them wrote for the present, and the future is the future of the present. Only if it is meaningful to the present will it be meaningful to the future." Depriving art of its function of serving the current struggle is not to elevate art, but to demean art, making art lose its vitality, separate from the people, and become a pure plaything for the leisure of a few people. This kind of art cannot be talked about any "long-term significance."
    Since Qin Zhaoyang opposes the principle of literature and art serving politics, he will inevitably deny the standard of literary criticism of "politics first, art second." Qin Zhaoyang's opposition to this critical standard is also evasive. He talked a lot in a roundabout way, but in fact he just wanted to get such a conclusion, that is, one cannot "say that artistic standards are not important." In his draft "People's Literature Improvement Plan," he put forward another so-called critical standard of "equal emphasis on artistic and ideological qualities." There are principle differences here. No one has said that artistic standards are not important. Comrade Mao Zedong said very clearly: We require "the unity of politics and art, the unity of content and form, and the unity of revolutionary political content and the most perfect artistic form possible. An artwork lacking artistic quality, no matter how politically progressive, is powerless." For artistic creation, we have always and will always require a high degree of unity of political and artistic qualities. However, in fact, not every writer's every work can achieve this unity. Ideological and artistic qualities often exist in contradiction in a work: some have better political content but poorer artistic quality, while some politically bad things may have some artistic quality. Because of this, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that when evaluating works, we should put the merits of its political content in the first place, and then evaluate the level of its artistic quality. The analysis and evaluation of the artistic quality of a work is also mainly to see whether it perfectly expresses the ideological content of the work. The artistic quality of a work serves its political quality, and it cannot have any independent significance in itself. Denying the political-first standard of literary criticism, talking about art away from politics, will reverse black and white, regard fragrant flowers as poisonous weeds, and regard poisonous weeds as fragrant flowers; it is very likely to prostrate oneself before bourgeois art, while adopting a negative and obliterating attitude towards the newborn proletarian art. Feng Xuefeng, Hu Feng and others were like this, and so is Qin Zhaoyang.
    In fact, they also put political standards in the first place, but their political standards are different from our political standards. Any class uses the political-first standard to evaluate works, and first considers whether it is beneficial to its own class. A bourgeois writer in France, Romain Gary, wrote a novel called "The Roots of Heaven," which is a terrible work in terms of artistic quality. Its writing is incoherent, and its style is poor. Even bourgeois critics believe that it is necessary to organize a "Committee to Protect the Purity of the French Language" to resist Gary's novel. However, because this novel promotes anti-Soviet and anti-communist ideas and praises French colonialism, it won the 1956 Goncourt Prize. How could Qin Zhaoyang not look at works from the standard of "politics first"? However, what he used was the bourgeois political standard. Many poisonous weeds selected and published by him in "People's Literature" were not very high in artistic quality, and some were even terrible. However, because their ideological content conformed to Qin Zhaoyang's political views, he was attracted to them. Qin Zhaoyang praised Liu Binyan's "Internal News of This Newspaper" not because that article had any achievements in art, but because its content happened to conform to Qin Zhaoyang's reactionary political idea of ​​transforming our Party and society with bourgeois individualism.
    In addition to obliterating the difference between socialist realism and old realism, on the issue of the typical, Qin Zhaoyang again used the so-called complexity of human character to blur the different class characteristics of people, opposed dividing people into positive or negative characters, and used abstract "human nature theory" to replace the view of class analysis of people.
    Yes, human character is very complex, and we oppose using simplified class-labeling methods to treat characters in literary works. However, like people in life, people in literature, in class society, cannot be above class. No matter how complex the character of the characters in the work is, and how peculiar his actions are, in the final analysis, the source of his class can still be found. Using the class point of view to examine the characters in the work does not necessarily obliterate the characteristics of literature. On the contrary, away from the class point of view, it is impossible to correctly understand literary phenomena.
    Qin Zhaoyang cited literary typicals such as Ah Q, Grigory (the protagonist in "And Quiet Flows the Don"), and Jia Baoyu as examples of his "human nature theory." According to Qin Zhaoyang's opinion, Ah Q's spirit is not a malformed product under specific social conditions, but a "human trait" that "everyone has" (emphasis in original). This is obviously wrong. Ah Q's "spiritual victory method" is of course not unique to the backward peasant class to which Ah Q belongs. It mainly reflects the thinking of the feudal ruling class, which was already crumbling under the impact of imperialist forces, but was still intoxicated with self-glorification. The typicals in literary works often not only reflect the characteristics of the class, but also embody a certain positive or negative social spirit and tendency of the era in him. Because the various classes in society are not isolated from each other, they not only influence each other, but also are affected by many factors of the same era. However, this spirit and tendency are expressed through the class characteristics of the characters. The expression form of the same "spiritual victory method" is different in Ah Q, a poor peasant, and in the landlord. Ah Q's spirit is by no means a "human trait" that "everyone has." Lu Xun also wrote many working people, such as the characters in "Village Opera," "Hometown," and "A Trivial Incident." They do not all have the spirit of Ah Q. According to Qin Zhaoyang's statement, one can only explain the spirit of Ah Q as a kind of inevitable and inevitable "human nature."
    This is actually a disguised "human nature theory."
    Qin Zhaoyang also used the tragic fate of Grigory as an example to prove that class analysis is not applicable to literary works. The reason is that Grigory is a middle peasant, "Although middle peasants have great volatility, most of them follow the revolution. However, Sholokhov wrote an image of a middle peasant who was anti-revolutionary to the end in the lengthy 'And Quiet Flows the Don'." Therefore, Qin Zhaoyang believes that "simply using the so-called class analysis method" "cannot fully explain these problems."
    Yes, Grigory's character and the road he took in life are very complicated. He vacillated more than once between the revolutionary ranks and the counter-revolutionary ranks. His heart was full of contradictions and conflicts, but he was unable to extricate himself, and he became more and more deeply involved in the counter-revolutionary mire. However, this duality of his personality is not an incomprehensible phenomenon. Grigory embodies the thoughts and emotions of many Cossack middle peasants in the early Soviet revolution. Middle peasants were originally left and right. He can tend to the proletariat or the bourgeoisie. The Cossack farmers also carried the serious prejudices of the gang hierarchy system caused by historical reasons. This made a Grigory, who came from the people and longed for freedom and labor, ran to the White Party camp against the working people to fight; Grigory, who opposed the people, could not but be destroyed in the end. Of course, in addition to showing the duality of the Cossack middle peasants, Grigory also has his own distinct personality, but this personality is combined with his characteristics as a Cossack middle peasant, and it is not a super-class and incomprehensible thing. When analyzing literary works, we should see the complex phenomena in the character of the characters, see the influence of various social factors on a person, and see the personal characteristics in each person's character, and do not use the simplified method of attaching class labels. However, no matter how complex the character of a person is, in the final analysis, it is still restricted by his class. "In class society, the class nature of people is the human nature and essence of people" (Liu Shaoqi). Forgetting this point, it is even more impossible to correctly understand the complex phenomena of human character. The Marxist method of class analysis, as Qin Zhaoyang said, is not useless in literature.
    As for Jia Baoyu appearing in the Grand View Garden, what is "difficult to explain" and "unexpected"? In the exploiting class, especially in the exploiting class that is approaching decline, the occasional occurrence of rebels who do not like the ugliness of their own class and are willing to break with their own class is a common thing in the past and now, and it is not worth being surprised at all, let alone drawing a conclusion that denies the class nature of people from this.
    Bourgeois writers and revisionists are like this, either only admitting the so-called commonality of mankind (that is, human nature), or only admitting the individuality of people. The purpose is to obliterate the class nature of people. However, "in class society, there is only human nature with class nature, and there is no super-class human nature." (Mao Zedong) The individuality of people is always marked with the brand of class nature, restricted by class nature, and often a multifaceted concrete manifestation of class nature in various specific people. In class society, there is no personality that exists independently from class nature.
    Qin Zhaoyang also tried to blur the boundary between advanced and backward people in life, and believed that dividing people into "advanced people and backward people" was "mechanical" and "confusing thoughts." Therefore, he also opposed the division of positive and negative characters in literature, believing that "there are not only two kinds of people, positive and negative, in real life, but it is very complicated!" (Jian Yu: Daily Conversation Record) Why is dividing people into advanced and backward, positive and negative, "mechanical" and "confusing thoughts"? Is it not true that there are differences between advanced and backward elements, positive and negative characters in life? Of course, between advanced and backward, there are many intermediate state elements, and advanced and backward, positive and negative are not absolute, they will transform each other. However, this does not obliterate the differences and contradictions between the two kinds of characters. Our literature must be good at reflecting this difference and contradiction, actively support advanced things, and stand on the advanced side of the contradiction to help overcome the backward side of the contradiction. Failing to see the difference between the advanced and backward, positive and negative, new and old things in life will make the writer lose the goal of struggle, make the writer not know what he should support and oppose,

    现实主义还是修正主义？
    林默涵
    和国际上的修正主义思潮相呼应，近两年来，修正主义的文艺思想在我国也曾经颇为时髦。第一个出来赶浪头的，是秦兆阳。在这时期，他用各种笔名写了许多具有修正主义倾向的文章，其中署名何直发表在“人民文学”1956年9月号上的“现实主义——广阔的道路”一文，可以说是一个系统的修正主义的文艺纲领。
    像国内外的一切修正主义者一样，秦兆阳也打着反对教条主义的旗子出现。实际上，是在反对教条主义的幌子下，攻击文学上的马克思主义的根本原则。他否定社会主义现实主义，反对作家应当具有社会主义精神；反对文艺为革命的政治服务，否定“政治第一”的批评标准；提倡“人性论”，反对用阶级观点来考察文学的现象；提倡“揭露生活的阴暗面”，主张按照资产阶级的观点来“干预生活”。他又利用他所主持的“人民文学”的地盘来实行他的修正主义的文艺路线，在刊物上放出大批毒草，不是为着准备批判，而是当作香花来推销，其中好些还经过他的修改而加强了毒素。以揭露新社会的“黑暗”出名的刘宾雁，就是秦兆阳一手捧出来的。一时许多右派分子和修正主义者把秦兆阳当作他们的旗帜，对他的修正主义文艺纲领热烈喝采。南京的一批右派分子准备创办的“同人刊物”“探求者”，就是以秦兆阳的“纲领”来作为它的宗旨的。秦兆阳的文艺思想，在我国文艺界的确一度起过煽动妖风的作用，它的影响是不可忽视的。所以，对于秦兆阳的错误，虽然已经有不少同志从各个方面加以揭露和批评，对于他的修正主义文艺“理论”，却还有继续进行比较系统的批判的必要。本文就着重就他的“现实主义——广阔的道路”一文中所提出的关于社会主义现实主义、关于艺术和政治的关系和关于典型这三个问题来分析他的修正主义文艺思想的实质。
    近两年来，各国资产阶级文人和国内外修正主义分子一致攻击社会主义现实主义，其目的，不仅是为了反对社会主义文学，而且是为了反对社会主义制度。他们说，社会主义现实主义使文学“衰落”了，它束缚作家的创作自由，社会主义现实主义文学所反映的社会主义的新生活是虚伪的，是粉饰现实的。由此就必然得出结论：社会主义社会是阻碍文学的发展的；在社会主义社会里，作家没有写作的自由；社会主义社会并不是像社会主义现实主义文学中所表现的那样美好，那样值得人们去追求。这是资产阶级和修正主义分子所要达到的真正目的。所以，反对社会主义现实主义，还是保卫社会主义现实主义，这不但是艺术思想上的问题，而且是具有政治意义的问题。
    秦兆阳攻击社会主义现实主义，是从怀疑社会主义现实主义的定义上做文章的。但他所反对的，不仅是社会主义现实主义的定义本身，而是从这里出发企图根本否定社会主义现实主义文学，这同外国一些修正主义者把社会主义现实主义看成是某几个人所臆造出来的东西，实际上是一样的。但是，社会主义现实主义文学决不是什么人凭空捏造出来的东西，它是在一定历史条件下必然产生的一种新型的文学。不是定义规定它的存在，而是它的存在产生了关于它的定义。在从理论上来阐明这种文学之前，它早已以崭新的姿态出现在世界上
  了。社会主义现实主义文学是在工人阶级已经成为历史舞台上的自觉的社会力量，是在人民为实现社会主义理想而进行的斗争中诞生的。大家知道，在十九世纪末到二十世纪初，世界革命运动的中心已经转移到俄国。俄国工人阶级在1905年举行了英勇的武装起义，而工农群众在革命时期的几年中所受到的政治教育，比平常几十年中所受到的都要丰富。新的现实，新的斗争，人们思想感情上的新的性质，必然要反映到文学上，使文学具有新的思想内容，同时也就不能不要求艺术方法上的变化和革新。就在1905年革命如火如荼的时候，列宁发表了“党的组织和党的文学”这篇经典性的文章，明确地规定了无产阶级文学的根本原则。1907年高尔基的长篇小说“母亲”问世，这部小说被公认为是社会主义现实主义的奠基的作品。很明显，俄国成为列宁主义的发源地，也是社会主义现实主义的发源地，这决不是偶然的。社会主义在苏联和许多国家的胜利，使社会主义现实主义得到了更广大的发展条件。今天社会主义现实主义的创作原则，已经为世界许多进步的作家所接受。一支新型的文学队伍，是一天比一天壮大了。在社会主义现实主义文学的旗帜上，我们可以找到许多世界闻名的杰出作家的名字。这是谁也抹煞不了的铁一般的事实。
    社会主义现实主义文学创作发展到一定阶段，必然会要求理论上的概括和阐释，因此就产生了关于社会主义现实主义的定义。定义是否完善，那是完全可以讨论的。任何定义，都不可能把现象的一切特征包罗无遗。用简单的几句话来概括一种复杂的文学现象，本来是困难的。随着社会主义现实主义文学的日益发展和创作实践的日益丰富，也许需要对它的定义作新的补充或修改。但是，难道因此就可以否定社会主义现实主义文学本身的存在和发展吗？否认社会主义现实主义文学的客观存在，只是唯心主义的幻想，正像秦兆阳不愿意承认自己是修正主义者，而修正主义者的秦兆阳却确实存在一样。
    在我国，革命的文学运动是在十月革命的影响下发生的，它一开始就受着共产主义思想的领导。随着工人运动和社会主义思想运动的发展，革命文学的社会主义倾向，也越来越强烈。社会主义现实主义的创作原则，很快就为我国许多进步的作家所接受。毛泽东同志“在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话”中，肯定了社会主义现实主义的创作原则，并且给了这个原则以科学的马克思主义的概括和阐释，从根本上解决了文艺为人民服务和如何服务的问题，解决了作家的世界观和创作的关系问题，使社会主义现实主义的原则更加明确和丰富了。
    秦兆阳为什么反对社会主义现实主义呢？最主要的是因为社会主义现实主义主张我们的文学必须担负起用社会主义精神来教育人民的任务。秦兆阳认为，要求文学用社会主义精神教育人民，“这就无异于是说，客观真实并不是绝对地值得重视，更重要的是作家脑子里某种固定的抽象的‘社会主义精神’和愿望，必要时必须让血肉生动的客观真实去服从这种抽象的固定的主观上的东西；那结果，就很可能使得文学作品脱离客观真实，甚至成为某种政治概念的传声筒。”多么奇怪的逻辑啊！为什么作家有了社会主义精神，就会不忠实于客观真实呢？难道作家缺少社会主义精神，或者满脑门的资产阶级思想，倒是更能忠实于客观真实吗？在秦兆阳看来，作家的社会主义精神，不但不会帮助作家去更好地认识客观真实，相反地，倒会妨碍作家去反映客观真实。他认为作家如果有了社会主义精神，就会“对现实主义本身强制性地加进什么东西去”，就会“让某种‘精神’——某种思想或愿望离开艺术的真实性而变成纯粹抽象的东西，并反转来用之去作用、去改变艺术的真实性”。怎么办呢？要社会主义精神，就会违反真实，要真实，就不能有社会主义精神。真实和社会主义精神原来是水火不相容的。而真实是文学艺术的生命，因此，社会主义精神就是一种十分可恶的破坏文学艺术的东西了。这就是秦兆阳的逻辑的必然结论。
    当然，秦兆阳反对作家需要具有社会主义精神，他所采取的手法是比较巧妙的。他说：社会主义精神“存在于生活的真实和艺术的真实之中”。这就是说，生活里面本来就有社会主义精神，作家只要真实地描写生活，他的作品里就自然会有社会主义精神。至于作家本人有没有社会主义精神，那是无关紧要的，如果有了这种精神，反而会有害处，因为那样，作家就会把自己“脑子里的一种抽象的概念式的东西”，“硬加到作品里去”，作品就不真实了。真是这样吗？我们要问：为什么秦兆阳所认为“真实”的刘宾雁之流的作品，那里面却并没有社会主义精神，而只有反社会主义的精神呢？我们还要问：为什么秦兆阳用真名字写论文，写小说，口口声声讲社会主义，而用别的笔名写文章，却反对社会主义精神？为什么秦兆阳以编者的身份修改王蒙的小说，加强小说的消极因素，又以批评家的身份公开批评王蒙，而所指责的却正是你所修改过的地方？为什么这样呢？原来秦兆阳是公开一套，暗里一套，他的“社会主义精神”是假的，是用来装门面的，这就难怪他要把它“硬加到作品里去”了。可见并不是社会主义精神和真实有矛盾，而是社会主义精神有真有假，而秦兆阳之流的虚伪的“社会主义精神”当然是同社会主义社会的真实相违背的。
    世界观同创作方法的关系，一直是争论纷纭的题目。资产阶级文人和国内外新老修正主义者都力图证明作家的世界观同他们的创作方法是没有什么关系的。他们认为，作家世界观的反动或落后，不但不会影响他对生活真实的观察和认识，甚至还暗示作家的世界观愈反动，作品就愈好，就愈能反映客观真实。秦兆阳虽然在字面上不得不承认创作方法“被世界观所影响所制约”，但在实质上是否定世界观对于创作方法的作用的。他把现实主义的创作方法看成是一种仿佛同作家的思想立场没有关系的纯粹的表现手法，不管作家的思想怎样，只要掌握了这种“方法”，就能够写出客观的真实。追随秦兆阳而在同年12月号的“长江文艺”上发表了“论现实主义及其在社会主义时代的发展”一文的周勃，就说得更露骨了。他说：“由于现实主义创作方法，乃是一种艺术创作丰富的经验积累的结晶，因而无论发展到怎样的高度，它的创作条件怎样变化，但从艺术创作方法本身来说，是不应该有什么改变……”还有一位郑秀梓说得更干脆：“所谓创作方法，在很大程度上只是属于一个纯表现手段的问题。”他们把创作方法同作家的世界观割裂开来，把艺术创作看成是一种无思想的活动。但是，离开了思想难道能够进行创作吗？作家怎样表现生活，首先决定于他怎样观察生活，怎样认识生活。而在作家观察生活和认识生活的过程中，不可避免地是受着他的世界观的指导和影响的。当然，另一方面，在生活实践中，世界观也时常发生变化。我们认为，世界观不能代替创作方法，也不能说只要有了正确的世界观就能够写出好作品，艺术创作还需要其他许多的条件。但是，世界观任何时候都是创作方法的灵魂，它总是给予创作方法以积极的或消极的影响，不但影响作者对于生活的看法，而且影响作者的艺术技巧和表达能力。对于今天的作家来说，取得无产阶级的立场和马克思主义的世界观，是对于他的创作具有决定意义的事情。而国内外的修正主义者所以竭力否认作家的世界观对于艺术创作的作用和意义，其真正用意就是要借此反对向作家提倡马克思主义的世界观，否认马克思主义世界观对于创作的指导作用。秦兆阳反对作家的社会主义精神，也无非是这个目的。
    秦兆阳既然否定世界观对于创作方法的作用和意义，就必然会把现实主义看成似乎可以离开时代环境和社会思潮而独立发展的东西。在他看来，现实主义好像一列火车，一站一站地向前开，不管时间和环境怎样变化，火车还是那一列火车，现实主义还是那个老样子的永恒不变的“现实主义”。从这种观点出发，他就很自然地抹煞了社会主义现实主义和过去的现实主义的本质区别。秦兆阳说：“想从现实主义文学的内容特点上将新旧两个时代的文学划分出一条绝对的不同的界线来，是有困难的。”（着重点原有）周勃说得更干脆：“前社会主义时代的现实主义与社会主义时代的现实主义在创作方法上，是没有、也不可能有什么区别的。”所以，他们都一致地否定社会主义现实主义，主张用“社会主义革命时代的现实主义”来代替社会主义现实主义。
    秦兆阳应当知道，世界上任何事物都不可能有“绝对的”界线的，白天和黑夜，生和死，光明和黑暗，谁能够找出它们之间的“绝对的界线”来呢？但是，并不能因此就否认各种事物的不同特点，否认各种事物的本质区别。“对于客观的辩证法说来，相对之中有着绝对。对于主观主义和诡辩说来，相对只是相对的，是排斥绝对的。”（见列宁：“哲学笔记”）用主观主义的诡辩来模糊事物的界限，正是修正主义者的一个重要的特征。他们在政治上模糊社会主义和资本主义的界限，混淆无产阶级专政和资产阶级专政的区别，甚至认为在资本主义社会里，无产阶级同资产阶级的对立已经不存在。在文艺上，抹煞社会主义现实主义和旧现实主义的区别，模糊社会主义文艺和资产阶级文艺的界限。不管他们自己是否承认，他们这样做的目的，就是帮助资产阶级去巩固资本主义制度，就是解除无产阶级反抗资本主义剥削的斗争意志，就是削弱社会主义思想对于劳动人民的影响。
    我们认为社会主义现实主义同过去的现实主义有本质的区别，并不否认它们之间的继承关系。事实上，今天的资产阶级作家早已把过去的现实主义的优良传统抛弃了，在资本主义世界中，许多伟大的古典作家受到毁贬，而猩猩的“绘画”却成为时髦，只有无产阶级才是真正珍惜和继承人类文化的一切优秀成果的。社会主义现实主义就是继承了过去现实主义的优良传统，同时又是和旧现实主义迥不相同的一种革新的艺术。社会主义现实主义的思想基础是科学的社会主义，而旧现实主义的思想基础一般地是民主主义和人道主义。社会主义现实主义的革新，表现在它不但把劳动人民的生活和斗争当作作品的重要主题，而且真实地揭示了人民群众在社会发展中的积极作用：劳动人民不是像在过去的文学中一样，只是被当作社会事件的配角或背景来描写，而是成了画面的中心，成了舞台上的主角；他们不是被表现为被同情被哀怜的对象，而是生活的主人和创造者。正是因为社会主义现实主义文学肯定了人民群众在生活和艺术中的主要地位，因此，社会主义现实主义文学就具有强大的鼓舞力，能够激发人们起来改造生活、变革世界，使人们充满了对于未来的希望和信心。只有从革命的发展中来反映现实的社会主义现实主义，才能充分表现生活中的新的因素，表现人民的伟大理想和英雄气魄。我们的生活是有理想的，而理想正是植根在生活的土壤里面。我们的现实就是豪迈的，充满了浪漫主义的奇迹的。社会主义现实主义正是革命的现实主义和革命的浪漫主义的有机的结合。而旧的现实主义文学，却常常只能暴露社会的黑暗和罪恶，不能进一步找出造成这种黑暗和罪恶的根源，也找不到足以战胜这种恶势力的新的力量，因此也就不能给人们指出前进的道路。其中有些作品还往往带着怀疑主义或悲观主义的色彩。并不是生活中没有出现积极的正面的力量，最主要的是由于旧的现实主义作家自己思想上的限制，使他们看不到这种力量。因此，这种文学也就不能具有强烈的鼓舞前进的作用。旧现实主义和浪漫主义之间常常（这是说不是完全这样）隔着一道鸿沟：现实主义只看到丑恶的现实，而浪漫主义却醉心于美丽的空想。怎么能说社会主义现实主义文学同旧的现实主义文学没有本质的区别呢？很明显，秦兆阳他们所以竭力抹煞这两种文学的区别，其目的是要否定社会主义现实主义文学，是要用资产阶级的文学来代替社会主义的文学。
    秦兆阳又说：“所谓旧现实主义，也并非绝对的只是批判的现实主义。”同时，他反对那种“认为社会主义现实主义与旧现实主义相反，它‘只是肯定的现实主义’，而不同时是批判的现实主义”的说法（着重点原有）。诚然，认为旧现实主义只是批判而什么也不肯定，或者认为社会主义现实主义只是肯定而什么也不批判，都是片面的，错误的说法，是不符合这两种文学现象的实际情况的；这种说法的错误，早已有人指出过了。但是，如果说旧现实主义主要是批判旧社会的黑暗，社会主义现实主义在批判旧社会的同时又有力地肯定新社会的光明，这样说法是符合实际情况的，并不错误。同样是又肯定又批判，而所肯定所批判的，有相同的地方，又有不同的地方。旧现实主义所批判的是旧的不合理的社会制度，它所同情的是不合理的社会制度下的牺牲者或“多余的人”，不管作者本人是否意识到；但由于它看不到或者不能充分看到可以肯定的新的社会力量，因而对于旧社会的批判也常常是不彻底的。而社会主义现实主义则一方面对旧的社会制度进行最彻底的批判，同时又以无比的热情来肯定和赞颂新的社会主义制度，因为这种制度是最先进的，是符合千百万人民的利益的。它的批判，也是为了保护社会主义制度，为了打击破坏社会主义制度的敌人和改造妨碍社会主义事业前进的事物。社会主义现实主义作家是自觉地担负起这个崇高的神圣使命的。这难道不是显然的区别吗？这种区别，是由于两种不同的作家所处的时代或社会环境和他们的思想立场的差异而造成的。谁要看不到或者不愿意看到这种区别，谁就要犯错误，甚至可能走向反党反社会主义的道路。因为那样他们就可能把对付旧社会的办法用来对付新社会，把揭露新社会的所谓“黑暗”当作文学的主要任务。秦兆阳、刘宾雁等人就正是这样地堕落成了修正主义者和右派分子的。
    让我们再来看一看，什么是“社会主义革命时代的现实主义”呢？这是一个十分笼统的概念。我们知道，自从资本主义进入帝国主义阶段，特别是在十月革命以后，世界就进入了社会主义革命时代。在这个时代，存在着各种不同的现实主义作家。且不说社会主义国家的情况，就拿今天的资本主义世界来说，那里有阿拉贡、聂鲁达、亚马多、希克梅特等等世界知名的作家，他们是服膺于社会主义现实主义的创作原则的；但是，还有另外一些作家，如刘易斯、汉明威、托马斯·曼、梅林、雷马克等等（有的去世不久），他们也应该说是现实主义作家，他们的作品常常真实地反映了资本主义社会的种种罪恶和痛苦，是有利于反对资本主义的斗争的。在这一点上，他们是我们的盟友。但是，他们的作品同社会主义现实主义的作品，无论在思想上、在描写对象上、在对读者所起的作用上，都存在着显著的区别，这是不能抹煞的事实。怎么能用“社会主义革命时代的现实主义”这个笼统的概念来混淆这两种显然不同的文学现象呢？
    我们认为，社会主义现实主义是最好的创作方法，但不是唯一的创作方法。把社会主义现实主义看成社会主义时代唯一的创作方法，是不符合实际情况的。那样只会或者排斥一切，使社会主义现实主义变成狭隘的宗派主义的东西；或者降格以求，把一切作家都包括到社会主义现实主义这个范畴中来。我们提倡社会主义现实主义，但每一作家采用什么创作方法，只能根据他的自愿，不能强迫。我们说社会主义现实主义是最好的，因为它是以最先进的马克思主义作为自己的指导思想的。但是，这并不是说只要有了社会主义现实主义，就必然会写出最好的作品来，因为艺术创作的成功与否，不光是决定于它的创作方法，它还有其他许多因素。方法既不能代替作家的艺术才能，也不能代替作家的生活经验。因此，在社会主义现实主义作家中有时会产生出一些并不优秀的作品，是一点也不足为奇的。那一个时代那一种艺术流派中没有出现过许多平庸的作品呢？修正主义者故意抹煞社会主义现实主义文学中的许多杰出的作品，而举出一些次等作品或者是冒充社会主义现实主义的膺品来作为攻击社会主义现实主义的口实，这只足以表现他们的偏见和技穷而已。
    文艺和政治的关系问题，是无产阶级文艺和资产阶级文艺两条路线斗争的焦点，也是我们同修正主义者之间的根本分歧点之一。无产阶级公开宣称无产阶级的文学艺术是无产阶级革命事业的一部分，是为革命的政治服务的。资产阶级却不敢公开承认他们的文学艺术为他们的阶级利益服务，他们打着“为艺术而艺术”的旗帜来掩饰他们的艺术的政治目的。实际上，“为艺术而艺术”正是为资产阶级的政治利益服务的。修正主义者也力图取消文艺为政治服务的原则。他们不公开提出“为艺术而艺术”的口号，而是用“艺术即政治”，用片面强调“艺术性”等论调来达到取消艺术为革命的政治服务的目的。实际上，他们是在暗暗地给资产阶级帮忙。
    秦兆阳说：“为政治服务和为劳动人民服务，是从政治上提出问题，它应该是作家的世界观的一部分，但它同时也是要求现实主义文学走向更加完美——更加提高其对于现实和对于艺术的自觉性。”原来“为政治服务和为劳动人民服务”只是作家世界观的“一部分”，那末，还有“一部分”或“大部分”是什么呢？除了为劳动人民服务之外，还为别的什么人服务呢？可否请秦兆阳给大家漏一漏底？其实，他的“底”就是“为资产阶级服务”，不过他不好直捷了当地说出来罢了。毛泽东同志说过，文艺“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”作家的世界观是他的各种观点的总和，但是，对于革命的作家来说，为劳动人民服务，为革命的政治服务，是他的世界观的基础，是最根本的东西，决不是什么可有可无的“一部分”。这里，秦兆阳企图把艺术和政治对立起来，好像艺术为政治服务，为劳动人民服务，就会妨碍它的“更加完美”似的。在他，文艺为政治服务，为劳动人民服务，那是万不得已的事情，因为这是“从政治上提出问题”，没有办法公开地加以拒绝呵！
    从前“第三种人”攻击我们，说我们是“目前主义的功利论者”，说革命的文艺是政治的“留声机”。同样意思的话，换了一个说法，现在又从秦兆阳的嘴里说出来了。秦兆阳也认为我们的文艺是“只顾眼前的政治宣传任务”的“政治概念的传声筒”。他提出了一个“文学艺术为政治服务和为人民服务应该是一个长远性的总的要求”的说法，来和文艺“为当前的政治任务服务”相对立，实质上就是取消了文艺为革命的政治服务。文学艺术是通过形象地反映生活来教育人民的，它不同于一般的宣传品，也不应该要求文学艺术去机械地图解某一种政策条文。但是，文学艺术的这种特殊性，并不妨碍它去为当前的政治任务服务。事实上，一切伟大的作家，总是把自己献给当时的紧迫斗争的。一个对当前人民的斗争熟视无睹、无动于衷的人，他又怎么能写出具有什么“长远意义”的作品来呢？被秦兆阳认为“具有长远的社会意义”的高尔基的名著“母亲”，恰恰是作者为了当时革命斗争的需要而写出来的，那时也曾遭到许多资产阶级批评家的攻击，说它是宣传品而不是艺术品。正是列宁出来保卫了这部小说，称赞它为“最切合时宜的一本书”。鲁迅驳斥当时“第三种人”的一段话，也可以用来驳斥秦兆阳。鲁迅说：“左翼也要托尔斯泰，弗罗倍尔。但不要‘努力去创造一些属于将来（因为他们现在是不要的）的东西’的托尔斯泰和弗罗倍尔。他们两个，都是为现在而写的，将来是现在的将来，于现在有意义，才于将来会有意义。”剥夺艺术为当前斗争服务的功用，这不是抬高艺术，而是贬低艺术，使艺术丧失活力，脱离人民，成为供少数人消闲的清玩。这种艺术，是谈不到什么“长远意义”的。
    秦兆阳既然反对文艺为政治服务的原则，就必然会否认“政治第一、艺术第二”的文艺批评的标准。秦兆阳反对这个批评标准，也是闪烁其词的。他转弯抹角地说了一大堆，其实只是为了要得到这么一个结论，就是不能“说是艺术标准并不重要。”在他草拟的“人民文学改进计划”中，他提出了另一种所谓“艺术性与思想性并重”的批评标准。这里是存在着原则的纷歧的。谁也没有说过艺术标准不重要，毛泽东同志说得很清楚：我们要求“政治和艺术的统一，内容和形式的统一，革命的政治内容和尽可能完美的艺术形式的统一。缺乏艺术性的艺术品，无论政治上怎样进步，也是没有力量的。”对于艺术创作，我们从来是并且永远是要求政治性和艺术性的高度统一的。但是，事实上，并不是每一个作家的每一部作品都能够达到这种统一，思想性和艺术性在一部作品中常常存在着矛盾：有的政治内容较好，而艺术性较差，有些政治上不好的东西，却可能有某种艺术性。正因为这样，所以毛泽东同志教导我们，在对作品进行评价时，应该把它的政治内容的好坏放在第一位来考虑，其次才去评价它的艺术性的高低。而分析和评价作品的艺术性，也主要是看它是否完美地表现了作品的思想内容。作品的艺术性是为它的政治性服务的，它本身不可能有什么独立的意义。否认文艺批评的政治第一的标准，离开了政治去谈艺术，就会颠倒黑白，把香花当毒草，把毒草当香花；就很可能拜倒在资产阶级的艺术面前，而对于新生的无产阶级的艺术则采取否定的、抹煞的态度。冯雪峰、胡风等人都是这样的，秦兆阳也是如此。
    实际上，他们也是把政治标准放在第一位的，不过，他们的政治标准和我们的政治标准不相同罢了。任何阶级都是用政治第一的标准来评价作品的，都是首先考虑是否对本阶级有利的。法国的一个资产阶级的作家罗曼·加里写了一部小说，叫作“天上的根苗”，是一部在艺术性上糟透了的作品，其文理不通，风格低劣，连资产阶级的批评家也认为有必要刻不容缓地组织一个“保卫法兰西语言纯洁性委员会”来抵制加里的小说。但是，因为这部小说宣传反苏反共，赞美法国的殖民主义，它就获得了1956年的龚古尔奖金。秦兆阳何尝不是从“政治第一”的标准来看作品呢？不过他所用的是资产阶级的政治标准罢了。经他选定发表在“人民文学”上的许多毒草，艺术性就一点也不高，有的甚至很糟糕，但是，因为它们的思想内容符合秦兆阳的政治观点，所以就被他看中了。秦兆阳那样赞扬刘宾雁的“本报内部消息”，也并不是因为那篇东西在艺术上有什么成就，而是因为它的内容正好符合秦兆阳的企图用资产阶级个人主义来改造我们的党和社会的反动的政治思想。
    秦兆阳除了抹煞社会主义现实主义和旧现实主义的区别之外，在典型问题上，又借口所谓人的性格的复杂性来模糊人的不同的阶级特征，反对把人分成正面人物或反面人物，用抽象的“人性论”来代替对于人的阶级分析的观点。
    不错，人的性格是很复杂的，我们反对用简单化的贴阶级标签的办法来对待文学作品中的人物。但是，正像生活中的人一样，文学中的人，在阶级社会里，也不可能是超阶级的。不管作品中的人物性格怎样复杂，他的行动怎样奇特，归根结蒂，仍然可以找到他的阶级的根源。用阶级的观点来考察作品中的人物，未必就抹煞了文学的特点。相反地，离开了阶级的观点，就不可能正确地理解文学现象。
    秦兆阳举出了阿Q、葛利高里（“静静的顿河”中的主角）和贾宝玉等文学上的典型来作为他的“人性论”的例证。按照秦兆阳的意见，阿Q精神并不是一种在特定的社会条件下的畸形产物，而是一种“无人不有”的“人的特质”（着重点原有）。这显然是错误的。阿Q的“精神胜利法”当然不是阿Q所属的那个落后的农民阶层所独有的东西，它主要地是反映了那个在帝国主义势力的冲击下已经摇摇欲坠、却仍然陶醉在自我夸耀中的封建统治阶级的思想。文学作品中的典型，常常不仅是反映了本阶级的特征，而且在他身上体现出那个时代的某种积极的或消极的社会精神和倾向。因为社会上的各个阶级并不是互相绝缘的，它们不但相互影响，而且都受到同一时代的许多因素的影响。但是，这种精神和倾向，是通过人物的阶级特征表现出来的，同是“精神胜利法”，它的表现形式在贫雇农的阿Q身上和在地主身上就不一样。阿Q精神决不是什么“无人不有”的“人的特质”，在鲁迅笔下还写了许多劳动人民，如“社戏”、“故乡”、“一件小事”中的人物，他们就并不都具有阿Q精神。按照秦兆阳的说法，那就只好把阿Q精神解释成为一种“莫可奈何的”、谁也无法避免的命定的“人性”。
    这实际上是一种变相的“人性论”。
    秦兆阳又用葛利高里这个人物的悲剧性的命运做例子，来证明阶级分析是不适用于文学作品的。理由是葛利高里是一个中农，“中农虽然有很大的动摇性，一般的却都是跟着革命走的。但是萧洛霍夫却在那部篇幅浩长的‘静静的顿河’里，写了一个反革命到底的中农的形象”。因此，秦兆阳认为“简单地用所谓阶级分析的方法”，“是不能完满地解释这些问题的”。
    不错，葛利高里的性格和他所走的生活道路是很复杂的。他在革命队伍和反革命队伍之间不止一次地动摇不定，内心充满了矛盾冲突，却又无力自拔，在反革命的泥坑里愈陷愈深。但是，他的个性的这种两重性，并不是什么不可理解的现象。在葛利高里身上正是体现着苏联革命初期许多哥萨克中农的思想和情绪。中农本来就是可左可右的，他可以倾向无产阶级，也可以倾向资产阶级。而哥萨克的农民还带着由于历史原因所造成的行帮等级制度的严重偏见。这就使得一个出身于人民，渴望自由、渴望劳动的葛利高里却跑到反对劳动人民的白党阵营中去作战了；同人民作对的葛利高里，最后不能不陷于毁灭。当然，在葛利高里身上，除了表现哥萨克中农的两重性之外，还有他自己的鲜明的个性，但这种个性是和他的作为哥萨克中农的特征相结合的，并不是什么超阶级的不可理解的东西。在分析文学作品的时候，我们应该看到人物性格上的复杂现象，看到各种社会因素对于一个人的影响，看到每一个人的性格上的个人特征，而不要采取简单化的贴阶级标签的办法。但是，不管人的性格有多么复杂，归根结蒂还是受着他的阶级性的制约。“在阶级社会中，人的阶级性，就是人的本性、本质”（刘少奇）。忘记了这点，就更不能正确地理解人物性格的复杂现象。马克思主义的阶级分析的方法，并不是像秦兆阳所说，在文学上是不中用的。
    至于在大观园里出现了贾宝玉，这有什么“不好解释”和“出人意外”呢？在剥削阶级中，特别是在接近没落的剥削阶级中，出现个别的因为看不惯本阶级的丑恶而愿意同本阶级决裂的叛逆者，是过去和现在都常有的事情，一点也值不得大惊小怪，更不能从这里得出否定人的阶级性的结论。
    资产阶级作家和修正主义分子，就是这样地或者只承认所谓人类的共性（即人性），或者只承认人的个性，目的都是为了要抹煞人的
  阶级性。但是，“在阶级社会里，就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性”。（毛泽东）而人的个性，则总是带着阶级性的烙印，受着阶级性的制约，而且常常是阶级性在各个具体的人身上的多方面的具体表现。在阶级社会中，脱离阶级性而独立存在的个性也是没有的。
    秦兆阳还极力模糊生活中的先进人物和落后人物的界线，认为把人“分成先进人物与落后人物”是“机械的”，是“混乱思想”。因此他也就反对在文学上的正面人物和反面人物的划分，认为“现实生活里并不是只有正面和反面两种人，而是复杂得很！”（鉴余：日常谈话录）为什么把人分成先进的和落后的、正面的和反面的，就是“机械”，就是“混乱思想”呢？难道生活中不是存在着先进分子和落后分子、正面人物和反面人物的区别吗？当然，在先进和落后之间，还有许多中间状态的分子，而先进和落后、正面和反面也不是绝对的，它们会互相转化。但是，并不能因此而抹煞两种人物之间的区别和矛盾。我们的文学正是要善于反映这种区别和矛盾，要积极支持先进的事物，要站在矛盾的先进方面来帮助克服矛盾的落后方面。看不到生活中的先进和落后、正面和反面、新事物和旧事物的差别，这就会使作家失去奋斗的目标，使作家不知道自己应该支持什么，反对什么，使作家丧失对于生活的热情和希望，而变成庸俗的旁观者。其实，秦兆阳的这个主张并不是什么新鲜的东西，那不过是陈企霞之流的“天下老鸦一般黑”的旧版翻新而已。
    既然不承认生活中有先进人物和落后人物、正面人物和反面人物的差别和矛盾，那末，作家对于生活中的人物当然也就可以一视同仁而无所爱憎了。所以，秦兆阳主张作家对于自己的人物不要有所评价，不要表示自己的态度，也不要对人物进行艺术的概括和加工。他在署名“鉴余”的“日常谈话录”这篇文章中说：“你先不要管她是反面人物还是正面人物，你切切实实地去写！……她在这一点上好，你就写她这一点好；她在那一点上不好，你就写她那一点不好”。这里秦兆阳是在鼓吹自然主义，不但不是社会主义现实主义，也根本不是什么现实主义。跟自然主义相反，社会主义现实主义的典型化的原则，要求作家揭露事物的内在联系，反映事物的本质。作家不是为写人而写人，而是通过人物和事件来反映历史的客观真实，同时也体现作家自己的思想。真正的艺术家对于形象的激动，总是和他对于这个形象的看法分不开的。这个形象所以激动他，是因为他从这个形象看到了生活中的问题，他要通过这个形象来表达他对于生活的见解。他们对于自己所描绘的事物，是不可能冷冰冰地无所爱憎的。所以，作家塑造典型，决不是看到什么就写什么，而是对素材加以分析、判断，有所取舍，有所强调和削弱，一句话，就是进行艺术的概括和加工。伟大作品中的典型形象，都是经过匠心的艺术创造。鲁迅在“狂人日记”中所写的“狂人”，是用他的一个发狂的表兄弟做模特儿的。但是，作品中的“狂人”并不是他的表兄弟的一鼻一眼的素描，而是经过他的提炼和调整，并且加进了为了体现他的思想所必须的想像和虚构，因而创造了一个具有深刻的社会意义的“狂人”的形象。通过这个形象，就集中、突出地表现了深受封建社会旧礼教迫害的青年人的精神特征，并且尖锐地揭露了封建制度的吃人实质。这里充满了鲁迅的强烈的同情和憎恨。假如鲁迅只是淡漠地纯客观地把他的表兄弟的疯狂状态记录下来，那样的作品就不会有多大意义了。
    以上所说，就是秦兆阳的修正主义文艺思想的主要内容。很明显，秦兆阳是在这次大风浪中出现的一个最有系统的文艺理论上的修正主义者。他在文艺界、特别是在一些文艺青年中所造成的毒害是不可忽视的。但是，秦兆阳的做法却比较巧妙，他不像有些反党分子一样明目张胆地搞反党活动，而是悄悄地、持续不断地在青年中间鼓吹资产阶级个人主义，散布对党敌视的情绪，企图按照资产阶级的思想来改造我们的党和社会。列宁在“做什么”一书中说，有一种机会主义者是在“渐渐地、悄悄地、可说是不受处分地败坏自己的党”。秦兆阳的作法就近于这一类。
    最后，还必须指出，秦兆阳的作风是极不老实的。他把自己打扮成大理论家的派头，好像他是新思想新理论的创立者似的，其实，他的那套修正主义的文艺“理论”不过是东抓西摭地拼凑起来的东西。1955年秦兆阳写过一篇批判胡风的文章，时隔一年，不料被秦兆阳批评过的胡风的文艺思想，却又在秦兆阳身上借尸还魂了。历史是无情的；在它面前，一切事物不管怎样遮盖，最后都要露出原形来。秦兆阳在1955年披的是“社会主义现实主义”的外衣，在1956年却改披了“现实主义”的外衣；第一件外衣是他自己剥掉的，第二件外衣是别人给他剥掉的。剥掉外衣一看，原来是一个不折不扣的资产阶级修正主义者！
