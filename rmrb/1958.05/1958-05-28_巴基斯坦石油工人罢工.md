Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: A strike by workers at four oil companies in Karachi, the capital of Pakistan, began on the 22nd and is continuing.

The four oil companies are: Burma Shell Oil Company, Texaco Oil Company, Mobil Oil Company, and Pakistan Oil Company. Three of the foreign oil companies extract large profits in Pakistan every year. According to a leaflet issued to the press by the Pakistan Petroleum Workers' Union, the net profit of the American-owned Mobil Oil Company last year was 75 million rupees, and the net profit of the British-owned Burma Shell Oil Company last year was 210 million rupees, but the workers' wages are very low.

The Pakistan Petroleum Workers' Union decided to strike on the evening of the 21st. Their demands are: 1. That the oil companies recognize the union as the representative body of all workers and negotiate directly with the union. 2. Increase wages. However, the oil companies have refused to negotiate with the union.

The Pakistan Labor Department has declared the strike "illegal." The government has also provided car drivers to operate oil tankers in order to undermine the strike.

The wave of oil worker strikes expanded on May 26 to the Sui gas wells in the former Baluchistan province of West Pakistan and the Burma Shell Oil Company in East Pakistan.

A spokesman for the Pakistan Petroleum Workers' Union said that workers at the British-owned Attock Oil Company will also join the strike later. According to newspaper reports, if Attock workers strike, it would cause a serious disruption in the inland oil supply. This company supplies 12% of Pakistan's oil needs.

    巴基斯坦石油工人罢工
    本报综合报道　据新社华讯：巴基斯坦首都卡拉奇的四家石油公司工人自22日起开始举行罢工，至今仍在坚持中。
    这四家石油公司是：缅甸壳牌石油公司、德士古石油公司、美孚油公司和巴基斯坦石油公司。其中三家外国石油公司每年在巴基斯坦攫取很多利润。据巴基斯坦石油工人联合会向报界发表的传单说，美国资本的美孚油公司去年的净利润是七千五百万卢比，英国资本的缅甸壳牌石油公司去年的净利润为二亿一千万卢比，但是工人的工资都很低。
    巴基斯坦石油工人联合会是在21日晚上决定罢工的。他们的要求是：一、各石油公司应该承认联合会是全体工人的代表机构，各石油公司应该直接同联合会进行谈判；二、增加工资。但是各石油公司拒绝同联合会进行谈判。
    巴基斯坦劳工部已经宣布罢工是“非法的”。政府还提供汽车驾驶员来开动运油车以破坏罢工。
    石油工人罢工浪潮在5月26日扩大到西巴基斯坦的前俾路支省的苏伊瓦斯井和东巴基斯坦的缅甸壳牌石油公司。
    巴基斯坦石油工人联合会的发言人说，英国资本的阿托克石油公司的工人以后也将参加罢工。据报纸消息，如果阿托克公司工人罢工，这就会造成内地石油供应的严重脱节。这个公司，供应巴基斯坦石油需要量的12％。
