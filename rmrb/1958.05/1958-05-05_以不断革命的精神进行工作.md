    Working with the Spirit of Continuous Revolution
    Jia Lin
    The Enlarged Meeting of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China raised an extremely important issue, which is to engage in work with the spirit of continuous revolution, so that work can continuously advance. The continuous revolution mentioned here means to constantly break through old levels with a revolutionary spirit and strive for new victories when doing work. This is Marxist revolutionary heroism. In leading the people's revolution and socialist construction, our party has always taken on tasks one after another, achieving victories one after another. Our party constantly educates the people with the revolutionary spirit of not being complacent and not stopping progress, and guides the struggle, so that the people can see greater tasks ahead even in victory, and thus never become arrogant and complacent. The reason why the Party can do this is because it takes the dialectical materialist world view as its ideological foundation. This world view enables people to have great communist ideals, to always observe problems from a developmental perspective, and to always see the more distant future, regarding any victory as only a part of the great cause of communism.
    Opposed to the spirit of continuous revolution are conservative ideas and stagnation. In the Great Leap Forward in production, people engaged in work with the spirit of continuous revolution, people's minds were unprecedentedly active, and they were striving for new victories every moment. This requires the leading organs to constantly determine new goals based on new situations in order to encourage the masses and overcome possible conservative and complacent ideas. This requires the leading organs to have scientific foresight, to constantly maintain a clear mind, to constantly raise new questions based on new situations, and to find correct ways to solve problems, so as to lead the people to exert full effort and continue to move forward.
    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China now raises this issue in a timely manner and puts forward new tasks in a timely manner based on the new situation. This is a concrete manifestation of the spirit of continuous revolution. The Xiangyang area has a bumper summer harvest, which is a good thing. However, if a new struggle goal of increasing grain production by 2 billion jin this year is not immediately proposed after the summer harvest, it may cause many people to slacken their efforts. Because the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, with its spirit of continuous revolution, put forward new inspiring slogans and pointed out the direction for people to move forward, the Great Leap Forward in production has moved towards a new peak.
    The fundamental issue of working with the spirit of continuous revolution lies in daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act, that is, to liberate the mind. Xiangyang Prefecture has barren land, less rainfall, and has always been a low-yield grain area. Last year, the total grain output was only 4 billion jin. This year, they originally planned to produce 6 billion jin of grain, an increase of half compared to last year, of which 2 billion jin were summer crops. Such a large increase in production was unimaginable in the past. Since the Great Leap Forward in production last winter, they have dared to think this way. They acted as soon as they thought of it, and strived to achieve it in all aspects. As a result, summer crops increased by 1 billion jin more than planned. Now, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee has further proposed the struggle goal of producing 8 billion jin of grain throughout the year. They are fully confident of completing this grand plan.

    以不断革命的精神进行工作
    加林
    中共湖北省委常委扩大会议上提出了一个极为重要的问题，就是以不断革命的精神从事工作，使工作不断前进。这里所说的不断革命，意思就是做工作时要不断地以革命的精神冲破旧的水平，争取新的胜利。这是马克思主义的革命英雄主义。我们党在领导人民革命和社会主义建设中，从来都是一个任务接着一个任务，一个胜利接着一个胜利。我们党经常以不要自满、不要停止前进的革命精神去教育人民，指导斗争，使人民能够在胜利时看到前面更大的任务，因而永远不会骄傲自满。党所以能够这样，是由于党是以辩证唯物主义的世界观作为自己的思想基础。这个世界观使人们具有伟大的共产主义理想，永远从发展的观点观察问题，能经常看到更远的将来。把任何一个胜利都只看作共产主义这个伟大事业的一部分。
    与不断革命精神相对立的，是保守思想和停滞不前。在生产大跃进的运动中，人们都以不断革命的精神从事工作，人们的思想空前活跃，每时每刻都在争取新的胜利。这就要求领导机关经常根据新的情况确定新的奋斗目标，以鼓舞群众，克服可能发生的保守自满思想。这就要求领导机关有科学的预见性，能经常保持清醒的头脑，经常根据新情况提出新问题，找出解决问题的正确办法，以便领导人民鼓足干劲，继续前进。
    中共湖北省委现在及时提出这个问题，并且根据新的情况，及时提出新的任务。这是不断革命精神的具体体现。襄阳地区夏季丰收了，这是好事。可是，在夏季丰收以后如果不立即提出今年再增产粮食二十亿斤的奋斗目标，那就可能使很多人的干劲松下来。由于襄阳地委的不断革命的精神提出了新的振奋人心的口号，指出了人们前进的方向，生产大跃进又走向了一个新的高峰。
    以不断革命精神进行工作的根本问题，在于敢想敢说敢作，就是说，要思想解放。襄阳专区土地瘠薄，雨水较少，一向是粮食低产地区。去年全年粮食产量只有四十亿斤。他们今年原来计划生产粮食六十亿斤，即比去年增产一半，其中夏收作物为二十亿斤。这样大的增产比例，过去是不敢设想的。而去年冬天生产大跃进以来，敢这样想了。他们想了就作，从各方面努力争取，结果使夏收作物比计划增产了十亿斤。现在襄阳地委进一步提出了全年生产粮食八十亿斤的奋斗目标。他们完全有信心完成这个宏伟的计划。
