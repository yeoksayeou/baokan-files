　　Another New Highway to be Built
　　The State Council has allocated funds to build the highway from Gar County to Pulan County. This highway is 250 kilometers long and connects the two largest markets in Ali. The highway will cross the Xiangquan River and the Langqu River, and cross the branch of the Gangdise Mountains, with an altitude generally above 4,000 meters. It is decided to start construction in late May and strive to open to traffic on October 1.
　　Smelting Pig Iron with Raw Coal
　　At the Natantai area at the foot of the Kunlun Mountains, the iron smelting experimental workshop set up by the Production Department of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Transportation Administration is using raw coal to trial-smelt pig iron. Under extremely difficult conditions of thin air at an altitude of more than 3,700 meters, without blast furnaces or testing instruments, they finally extracted 25% pig iron from the ore in mid-April after many experiments.
　　Collecting Quartz Crystals on the Tanggula Mountains
　　Tibetan residents in the Tanggula Mountains discovered crystal mines in several large caves, and the local Party committee immediately organized them to start mining. In the past month, 12,000 catties of quartz crystals have been mined here.
　　The Tibetan residents creatively heated the crystal caves with yak dung fires to melt the solid ice before digging. Most of the quartz crystals dug out in this way are complete hexagonal plants with dazzling brilliance.
　　Lhasa to Build a Library
　　The Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China has decided to build a library in the urban area of Lhasa to meet the needs of workers and staff in the Lhasa area for cultural life. This library may be completed this year. The library will include: a Xinhua Bookstore store, table tennis and chess game rooms, a lending library, a bookstore and Tibetan and Chinese reading rooms, a children's reading room, and a photo exhibition room.
　　The First Dam
　　In 1957, in the Duodi Gully in Lhasa, the central government helped the Tibetan people build the first dam on the Tibetan Plateau.

    再修一条新公路
    国务院拨款修筑噶尔昆沙到普兰宗的公路。这条公路全长二百五十公里，连接着阿里最大的两个市场。公路将横跨象泉和狼楚两条大河，并越过冈底斯山的支脉，海拔一般都在四千公尺以上。决定5月下旬开工，争取10月1日通车。
    用原煤炼生铁
    在昆仑山下的纳赤台地区，青藏公路交通运输管理局生产处所设的炼铁试验工场，用原煤试炼生铁。他们在海拔三千七百多公尺，空气稀薄，既无高炉、鼓风炉，又无化验仪器的极端困难的条件下，经过多次试验，终于在4月中旬，从矿石里炼取到25％的生铁。
    唐古拉山上采水晶
    唐古拉山区藏民在几个大山洞里发现了水晶矿，当地党委立即组织他们进行开采。最近一个月中已经在这里采掘出一万二千斤水晶。
    藏民们创造性地在水晶洞里用牛粪煨火加热，使坚冰融解后再掘。这样掘出来的水晶绝大多数都是六棱完好的整株，光彩夺目。
    拉萨将建图书馆
    中共西藏工委为了满足拉萨地区工人和职员文化生活的需要，决定在拉萨市区修建图书馆。这个图书馆可能在今年建成。图书馆中将包括：新华书店门市部、乒乓球和棋类游艺室、借书处、书库和藏、汉文阅览室、儿童读物阅览室以及照片展览室等。
    第一座拦水坝
    1957年在拉萨夺底沟，中央人民政府帮助西藏人民建成的西藏高原上第一个拦水坝。
