    Strive for a Bumper Wheat Harvest
    The wheat in the Yuejin Agricultural Cooperative in Shiren Township, Luoyang City suburbs, is growing very densely and strongly, with deep green stems and leaves, and uniform heading, presenting a scene of a great harvest. Now, the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members is growing with the vigorous growth of the wheat. They put forward the slogan "Management doesn't stop until the wheat is harvested," and continue to strengthen the late-stage management of wheat fields to create a miracle of wheat yield.

    争取小麦大丰收
    洛阳市郊区石人乡跃进农业社的小麦长得非常稠密茁壮、茎叶深绿、抽穗齐整，呈现大丰收的景象。现在，社员们的生产劲头随着麦子的旺盛成长越来越大。他们提出“麦子未收、管理不休”的口号，继续加强麦田后期管理工作，要创造小麦丰产的奇迹。
