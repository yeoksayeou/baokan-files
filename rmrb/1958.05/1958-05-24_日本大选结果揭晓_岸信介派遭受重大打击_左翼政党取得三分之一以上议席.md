Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd Dispatch: In the seventh post-war general election for the Japanese House of Representatives held on May 22nd, Japanese progressive forces advocating a path of peace and independence made progress, while the Liberal Democratic Party suffered a setback due to Nobusuke Kishi's insistence on submitting to the United States and reviving militarism.

According to the unofficial final results tallied today, out of the total 467 seats in the House of Representatives, left-wing parties secured more than one-third of the seats, with the Socialist Party holding 166 seats, an increase of eight seats compared to the previous election. The Japanese Communist Party actually received 1.1 million votes, an increase of 300,000 votes compared to the last general election. Nevertheless, due to the undemocratic current electoral system, the Japanese Communist Party's seats decreased from the original two to one. The Liberal Democratic Party lost three seats, retaining only 287 seats. Among the remaining seats, small parties hold one seat, and independent candidates hold twelve seats.

The outcome of the general election shattered Kishi Nobusuke's boast during the campaign that the Liberal Democratic Party could win 310 seats in the general election. The Kishi Nobusuke group originally attempted to seize two-thirds of the seats in the House of Representatives through this general election in order to revise the constitution prohibiting Japan from possessing war-making capabilities. Not only that, the most reactionary Kishi Nobusuke faction within the Liberal Democratic Party suffered an even greater blow in the general election. Sources say that the seats held by the Kishi Nobusuke faction have decreased by about ten seats from the past seventy-plus seats.

The Kishi Nobusuke group employed various despicable means in this general election to maintain its position as the majority party. Sources say that Japanese monopoly capital provided the Liberal Democratic Party with more than one billion yen in funds for campaign purposes. The Kishi Nobusuke group also engaged in large-scale malfeasance and manipulation in the general election. The Kishi Nobusuke group also mobilized grassroots organizations to actively solicit voters in the rural areas under their control to vote for the Liberal Democratic Party.

The Kishi Nobusuke group constantly attacked and persecuted progressive forces during the campaign. Kishi Nobusuke mobilized all propaganda machinery to wantonly slander the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), alienating their relationship. Many Communist Party members and trade union cadres were persecuted. Even on the 23rd, the police authorities were still resorting to vicious tactics, taking the opportunity to arrest Communist Party members while arresting those who violated the election law.

    日本大选结果揭晓
    岸信介派遭受重大打击
    左翼政党取得三分之一以上议席
    据新华社23日讯　东京消息：在5月22日举行的日本战后第七次众议院选举中，主张走和平和独立的道路的日本进步力量获得进展，自由民主党由于岸信介坚持屈从美国和复活军国主义政策而受到了挫折。
    根据今天开票的非正式最后结果，在众议院全部四百六十七个议席中，左翼政党取得了超过三分之一的席位，其中社会党占一百六十六席；比以前增加了八席；日本共产党实际得票一百一十万张，比上次大选增加了三十万票，尽管如此，由于不民主的现行选举制度，日本共产党的议席从原来的两席减为一席。自由民主党失去了三席，只保持住二百八十七席。在其余的席位中，小党派占一席，无党派人士占十二席。
    大选的结果打破了岸信介在竞选期间一再宣扬自由民主党在大选中可以获得三百一十席的吹嘘。岸信介集团原来企图通过这次大选攫取众议院三分之二的议席，以便修改禁止日本拥有战争力量的宪法。不仅如此，自由民主党内最反动的岸信介派在大选中受到更大的打击。有消息说，岸信介派所占的议席已经比过去的七十多席减少了十席左右。
    岸信介集团在这次大选中是采取各种卑鄙的手段才保住多数党的地位的。有消息说，日本垄断资本曾经拿出十亿日元以上的资金给自由民主党作为竞选之用。岸信介集团还在大选中大肆营私舞弊，多方操纵。岸信介集团还动员基层组织，在它们控制着的农村积极拉拢选民去投自由民主党的票。
    岸信介集团在竞选中不断打击和迫害进步力量。岸信介发动全部宣传机器滥肆诬蔑共产党、社会党和日本工会总评议会，离间它们之间的关系。许多共产党人和工会干部受到迫害。直到23日，警察当局还玩弄恶毒的手段，在逮捕违反选举法者的同时，乘机逮捕共产党人。
