Producing More and Better Machines to Ensure High-Speed Development of Socialist Construction
Zhao Erlu, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building

Any department or any place needs more and better machines to speed up construction and carry out technological revolution.
To Catch Up with Britain in Fifteen Years: The need for various industrial and transportation equipment during the Second Five-Year Plan will increase sixfold compared to the First Five-Year Plan.
To Realize National Water Conservancy: Requires 15 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery.
To Realize Agricultural Mechanization: Requires 550,000 standard tractors, various agricultural implements, and 20 million units of agricultural machinery.
To Achieve Preliminary Agricultural Electrification: Requires 8 million kilowatts of power generation equipment.
To Change from Manual Labor to Animal-Drawn Carts or Power Traction: Requires 100 million sets of ball bearings and hundreds of thousands of various trucks.

In the nationwide Great Leap Forward, the machine-building industry faces the situation where any department or any place needs more and better machines to speed up construction and carry out technological revolution. With all forces surging forward and mutually promoting each other, the machine-building industry is required to whip the horse to catch up and strive for the upstream; otherwise, it will be difficult to ensure the realization of the leap forward plan for national production and construction.

Since the plan to catch up with Britain in 15 years in industry was proposed, the demand for equipment in metallurgy, power stations, mining, petroleum, chemical industry, transportation, and light industry has greatly increased. During the Second Five-Year Plan, the total demand for industrial and transportation equipment is estimated to increase by about six times compared to the production volume of industrial and transportation equipment during the First Five-Year Plan.

The Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program will be realized ahead of schedule in various regions. To achieve water conservancy, the country needs about 15 million horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery. To basically achieve agricultural mechanization, approximately 550,000 standard tractors and over 20 million units of various agricultural implements and agricultural and sideline processing machinery are required. In terms of agricultural electrification, if we want to reach the preliminary electrification target of 0.01 to 0.02 kilowatts of power equipment per person in rural areas (after this year's leap forward, China's rural areas only have 0.0018 kilowatts per person, while Japan has reached 0.08 kilowatts), we will need 8 million kilowatts of power generation equipment in rural areas. To replace manual labor with animal-drawn carts or power traction, we need at least 100 million sets of ball bearings and hundreds of thousands of various trucks.

The total output value of local industries will exceed the ever-growing total output value of agriculture ahead of schedule. This year, the growth rate of the national local industrial output value will reach more than 37%, and the growth rate in many provinces will exceed 50%. It is estimated that during the Second Five-Year Plan, if each county builds a batch of factories, the investment will be over 10 million yuan, and the number of mechanical equipment required by more than 2,000 counties nationwide is considerable.

While all aspects are leaping forward, the machine-building industry itself must also accelerate the construction of new factories, update equipment, and carry out technological revolutions, requiring hundreds of thousands of machine tools within five years.

The surging tide of construction has become a torrent promoting the great development of the machine-building industry. The equipment required is not only large in quantity but also diverse in variety and urgent in time. Therefore, the machine-building industry cannot move forward at a normal pace but must leap forward with revolutionary methods, taking three steps at a time and multiplying several times over. For China to transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, from a production method mainly based on manual labor to a production method mainly based on modern machinery, the machine-building industry faces this glorious and arduous task. People are invigorated and determined to go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.

Machine-Building Industry Must Lead the Way

We have repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's instructions, especially those in the recent period, and deeply realized the great and far-reaching significance of completing the cause of socialist construction as soon as possible in a large country with a population of over 600 million. And the fundamental issue of building socialism is the issue of high-speed development.

The speed of development is an even more prominent issue for the machine-building industry. Because industrial departments, especially heavy industry, need to install equipment one year or six months in advance to meet the leap forward production targets. To achieve the 1962 steel production target, the required metallurgical equipment must be supplied before 1961, and power station equipment must be supplied even earlier. To achieve agricultural leap forward targets, equipment must also be supplied in advance to adapt to the farming season. The equipment needed for three years of water conservancy must be basically prepared within two years. To ensure the realization of the targets of the Second Five-Year Plan in various industries and regions, most of the equipment must be supplied in the first few years. In addition, there is the time and production cycle that the machine-building industry itself controls. Therefore, the development of the machine-building industry must precede the expansion of reproduction in various departments and precede basic construction. If we cannot whip the horse to catch up, it will delay the realization of the leap forward plan of various departments and regions.

High-speed development of the machine-building industry is entirely possible. We have the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the superior socialist system, and the mass line of our Party's tradition; especially through rectification, people have liberated their minds and are overcoming dogmatism and empiricism. The general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results has taken root in people's hearts, and productivity has been greatly liberated. We also have the technical assistance of the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, as well as the promotion and collaboration of various fraternal departments. These are the basic guarantees for achieving the leap forward.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the machine-building industry established a preliminary foundation, and each industry has a backbone, which is the foothold for the leap forward. By the end of 1957, there were more than 20,000 large and small factories nationwide with 1.76 million employees. In terms of construction, some experience has been gained. Five or seven yuan can be used to do ten yuan's worth of work, and the construction time can also be reduced by half. Some can be replicated, and some can be expanded using old factories. The construction speed can be much faster than in previous years.

The main new products to be produced in the next five years will be more than 20,000 types. We need to further master the production of heavy, precision instruments, jet, and electronic technology, fill in the missing industries, and adapt to the diverse needs of agriculture and local industries. In product design, we must gradually move from imitation to improvement and independent design. In these areas, there are certain difficulties due to the weakness of technical forces. However, the experience of the past few years, especially since the upsurge, has proven that technology is not something mysterious. When the creativity of the masses of employees is brought into play and there is advanced technology and experience from the Soviet Union and fraternal countries, technology can be quickly mastered. The problem is whether or not to follow the mass line. In the Great Leap Forward, people are moving forward at a rapid pace. In the first half of this year, more than 80 types of tractors have already been produced; more than 10 types of automobiles have been produced. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory plans to design 100 types and trial-produce 40 types of machine tools with relatively high precision requirements this year.

It can be imagined that in such a situation of all forces surging forward, differences in pace and temporary imbalances may occur. But as long as the direction is right, as long as we can go deep among the masses, conduct timely inspections, take effective measures, and combine lofty goals with a realistic spirit, we will definitely be able to shoulder the heavy responsibility of supplying the thousands of types of equipment needed by the whole country.

The Whole Country as One Chessboard
Each Region Also Has Its Own Chessboard

In order to implement the general line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and according to the principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture, simultaneously developing central and local industries, and simultaneously developing large and medium-sized enterprises, we must plan comprehensively, establish factories at all levels, and make various mechanical factories grow like stars scattered across the country. Doing so can unleash the infinite human and material resources of the country, making it both fast and economical. China has a vast territory and great needs, but there are too few existing mechanical factories, and the regional distribution is unreasonable, which is far from meeting the requirements of socialist construction. Therefore, it is essential to form a complete system of the mechanical industry nationwide.

Each economic cooperation zone has a population of tens of millions to over 100 million and should gradually form a mechanical industry system that meets the needs of the region's economic development, based on the decentralized mechanical enterprises and the original local mechanical enterprises. To manufacture a mechanical equipment, the parts are often in the thousands, and some require large and special equipment for processing. It is uneconomical to do everything yourself in one factory, and mutual cooperation is required. In the past, because the whole country was only one chessboard and the system within the region was incomplete, many unreasonable collaborations occurred. The turbine shaft of Shanghai had to have steel ingots poured in northern Manchuria, forged in Shenyang, heat-treated in Taiyuan, and then returned to Shanghai for processing and assembly. The forging, casting, and large parts processing of sugar-making equipment in Guangzhou often had to be collaborated with the Northeast. Before the Great Leap Forward, the collaboration of these key processes was already crowded and overwhelmed; after the Great Leap Forward, the tense situation can be imagined. If one collaborative part cannot be supplied, a large number of existing parts cannot be assembled, and the collaboration is spread across the country, wasting time, delaying work, and causing great waste, which greatly dampens the enthusiasm of the masses to achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Therefore, economic cooperation zones must gradually form a relatively complete system, so that general collaboration can be done within the zone. But this does not mean that the country does not have a complete system. In the future, we still need to gather the strength of various regions and add some key large enterprises to form and improve the complete system of the national mechanical industry. Collaboration between cooperation zones is still necessary, but it should only be suitable for heavy or technically demanding collaboration, because these special large enterprises are difficult to have in every region in a short period of time. And due to the increasing development of production and the increasing technical requirements, major national collaborations between regions will continue to exist for a long time in the future, and should be strengthened.

The mechanical industry system of each economic cooperation zone is gradually formed and developed according to the needs of the zone's economic development, and the requirements should be different. Each economic cooperation zone should consider the entire zone according to different conditions, organize the factories in the entire zone, and gradually fill in the gaps, so that the zone has some basic industries of the mechanical industry, such as machine tools, power station equipment, heavy and mining machinery, instruments, agricultural machinery, power machinery, electrical machinery and appliances, chemical equipment, general machinery, accessories, and ball bearings. Each zone should successively establish a forging and casting center with a water press of several thousand tons or more and have several large processing equipment. At the same time, according to the characteristics of the zone and the original foundation, and under the principle of national unified planning and reasonable regional distribution, some industries should be prominently developed, so that these industries become a base point in the national mechanical industry system and share the national production and collaboration tasks. For example, heavy machinery industry base points should be established near the major metallurgical bases in the country; mining machinery base points should be established in the major coal bases and "non-ferrous metal provinces"; shipbuilding base points should be established on the coast; and advanced instrument and precision machinery base points should be established in areas with a long technical tradition and a concentration of scientific and technical talents. The national power supply is tight, and the power station equipment manufacturing capacity is insufficient. In addition to building several large power station equipment factories, some medium-sized power station equipment factories should be replicated in several industrial bases immediately.

During the Second Five-Year Plan, each province, city, and autonomous region should establish its own mechanical industry foundation in combination with its own economic characteristics and resource conditions. In a few years, each province should have a forging and casting center with a water press of 1,000 tons and a mechanical processing force mainly based on versatility, and build several factories. In the future, there will be a large demand for agricultural machinery, rural power station equipment, and sideline processing machinery, with many varieties, and they must be adapted to different economic, natural, and crop conditions in various places. They should be manufactured, supplied, and used locally under the principle of roughly dividing the work in the economic cooperation zone. The equipment for small steel plants, power stations, coal mines, chemical plants, and artificial petroleum plants in various provinces can also be manufactured by themselves as long as they obtain the cooperation of some large factories. Due to the rapid development of agricultural semi-mechanization and mechanization, and the increase in agricultural machinery and rural transportation tools, the repair tasks will increase day by day. The machinery used for people's lives is also mostly suitable for self-supply within the region. The above-mentioned tasks should be basically undertaken by the mechanical industry of the province. In addition, under unified planning, they should share the collaboration tasks of the entire region; and undertake accessory or collaboration tasks for nearby large factories.

The mechanical industry has a wide service area and many varieties, and each stage of the technological revolution has different equipment needs. It is difficult for a factory to make many varieties. On the other hand, if the scope of specialization is too narrow, it cannot adapt to changes in tasks. Therefore, it is necessary to combine the specialization and versatility of local mechanical factories. For example, general machinery factories should be able to produce equipment for light industry, chemical industry, petroleum industry, and other aspects. Power machinery factories should be able to supply agricultural irrigation and drainage and general power machinery, as well as engines for automobiles and tractors. In the future, on the basis of this irrigation and drainage power machinery, as long as an accessory factory is added, automobiles and tractors can be assembled; this is more economical than establishing a professional automobile and tractor factory, and has greater maneuverability, which can adapt to the needs of development.

Each county should build several small repair and manufacturing factories to form a repair network. Simple agricultural machinery is manufactured in the county, both repairing and manufacturing; mainly serving the county's agricultural production and rural industry. Townships and communes should establish repair stations. The blooming of repair stations all over the countryside can ensure that various agricultural mechanical and electrical equipment can be repaired in the township for minor repairs and in the county for major repairs.

In terms of factory construction methods, there are several convenient paths: one is to expand and rebuild old factories, make full use of the old foundation, make do with whatever is available, and produce while building; the second is that factories that must be newly built can use existing designs or various typical designs, and after review and modification, replicate them; the third is to use the method of experimental factories, trial-produce in the original small factories, and then build factories after mastering the technology; fourth, in the repair and manufacturing factories in counties and the repair stations in townships and communes, many typical examples of building factories diligently and frugally, quickly and well have already emerged, and the design department has also made several standard designs, which can be summarized and promoted.

Simultaneously developing central industry and local industry is a major strategy for accelerating industrialization and technological revolution. In the past, we concentrated our efforts on key projects, and paid insufficient attention to overall planning. There was a one-sidedness in our thinking. The mass line and the policy of building the country diligently and frugally were not implemented well enough. The original practice of only one chessboard in the country can no longer adapt to the situation of comprehensive development. It is necessary to have a chessboard in each economic cooperation zone, and combine these many chessboards to form a national chess game. And on those key moves that cannot be handled by national forces, the central government concentrates its efforts on construction. Only in this way can all positive factors be fully mobilized, develop vigorously in a comprehensive and focused manner, and form a complete system of China's mechanical industry.

Change the System, Face the Whole Country

Since the rectification, the issue we have repeatedly considered is: how to liberate ourselves from a large number of trivial affairs and face the whole country, grasp the main problems, and allocate more strength to manage local industries. This requires us to improve our working methods, strive to be both red and expert, and resolutely burn the three winds and five airs. At the same time, we must also change the system of the mechanical industry and decentralize factories. After the system is changed, we can better face the whole country and go deep among the masses.

With the decentralization of factories, the unity of political leadership and business leadership, the mass line can be more fully implemented. Local direct leadership of factory production facilitates timely resolution of problems and is of great benefit in strengthening collaboration and tapping potential. Provinces, cities, and economic cooperation zones can also use these decentralized factories as the backbone of the region's mechanical industry to accelerate the development of local industries.

After repeated research, we plan to decentralize the factories under the First Ministry of Machine Building to the localities. The biggest benefit of doing so is that all positive factors can be fully mobilized, and at the same time, comrades from the ministry and the localities can work together with one heart and one mind to comprehensively develop the mechanical industry under unified planning. The characteristic of the mechanical industry is that collaboration and cooperation are complex, and local and national collaboration and cooperation are necessary. In the same region, if there are two types of factories, those directly under the central government and those under local management, it is easy to have some one-sidedness when arranging the priority of tasks. After all decentralization, without boundaries, we can consider the problems more comprehensively.

However, considering the convenience of provinces and cities taking over and avoiding temporary disconnection and imbalance caused by the transition, decentralization can be implemented in steps and industries. Currently, enterprises that are closely related to agricultural and local industrial development should be decentralized immediately.

In addition to decentralizing existing factories, construction projects of the Second Five-Year Plan will also be decentralized. After these newly built and expanded projects are approved by the central government, the localities will lead the construction. After completion, they will be managed by the localities. The advantage of this approach is that local management and construction can closely cooperate in all aspects, which is fast and economical.

The tasks that were originally balanced nationally should be decentralized along with the factories, so that the formed division of labor and cooperation can continue to be carried out to ensure complete supply. In the future, it will be adjusted as the situation develops. While decentralizing factories and tasks, we must also help localities replenish the manpower of the mechanical and electrical industries, especially the technical force. Therefore, we are preparing to decentralize secondary technical schools and technical schools accordingly. Only by changing the system can the ministry's institutions be greatly streamlined and a group of management cadres and engineering technicians be transferred to replenish the localities.

After the four decentralizations (decentralization of factories, construction projects, schools, and cadres), the ministry's responsibility is not lightened but increased. We must do our job well. First, we must manage planning. Combining the decentralized factories, the original foundation of the region, and the economic development requirements of the region, we must propose plans from the bottom up, and coordinate and balance from the top down, starting from the whole country, and jointly agree on the development plan of the mechanical industry in various regions. So that the mechanical industry in various regions can not only solve problems independently but also have mutual dependence and cooperation, forming a national system.

Second, we must manage the balance. The production and sales balance and collaboration of annual tasks always need to be modified and adjusted according to the actual situation. Localities directly command production within the region and can conduct balancing and scheduling locally under the national plan. We organize the balance of major products and the collaboration and difference balance between economic cooperation zones.

Third, we must manage technical guidance. The first step is to formulate technical policies as the direction of technical development in various industries. According to these directions, we combine the top and bottom to compile technical development plans. For the cutting-edge technologies and major new products in the plan, we must help localities and enterprises take effective measures to ensure their realization. In order to promote technical leap forward research and experimentation, we must organize the forces of various industries and regions according to the requirements of technical development to form a national research and experimentation network and information network. In addition, in the case of developing varieties in a hundred flowers blooming manner, we must gradually carry out the serialization of products, the generalization of components, and the standardization of parts.

Fourth, we must supervise, inspect, and exchange experience. Regularly organize comprehensive or focused inspections with provinces and cities, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. We often adopt methods such as appraisals, visits, on-site meetings, and exhibitions to summarize experiences and organize exchanges and promotion, so as to achieve mutual promotion and common improvement.

This change in the system, with four decentralizations and four managements, is a major change in production relations. In the past, our understanding of relying on the masses and relying on the localities to develop production was not profound. We believe that after this reform, the political and business leadership of factories will be more unified, and the enthusiasm of localities and the masses will be more fully brought into play, which will be conducive to the great development of the national mechanical industry.

Break Superstition, Rely on the Masses,
Carry Out Technological Revolution

Whether the mechanical industry can meet the requirements of all aspects in terms of variety, whether it can supply in advance in terms of quantity, whether it is economical in use, and whether it can guarantee the quality will all affect the technological revolution of various departments. To strive for the rapid development of varieties, the rapid increase of output, and the improvement of product performance, quality, and cost reduction, we must rely on technological development.

During the First Five-Year Plan, the mechanical industry mastered the manufacturing of general machine products and some large and precision products. In the next five years, it is necessary to manufacture complete sets of large iron and steel plant equipment, large-capacity power station equipment, heavy and precision machine tools, instruments, and various agricultural machinery. At the same time, it is also necessary to master various cutting-edge technology products. To achieve such a series of huge tasks, it is necessary to require the mechanical industry to make a great leap in technology, so that it can approach the world's advanced level in about ten years.

The key to technological leap forward lies in breaking superstition, liberating thinking, implementing the mass line, and closely combining learning with creation.

During the First Five-Year Plan, we learned from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, and with their technical assistance, we built a number of foreign-designed factories equipped with the latest technology, the technical equipment of many old factories was updated, and we mastered many advanced technologies. By imitating Soviet products, we expanded the variety and exercised design and manufacturing capabilities. These have played a great role in the technological development of the mechanical industry. Grasping the learning aspect is right, and the results are significant. However, there is a tendency to mechanically copy in learning. Not enough attention has been paid to the close combination of learning and creation; technology has been mystified in many aspects. Regardless of the size, precision, or roughness of the product, whether it is imitation or self-design, it is necessary to conduct three-stage trial production. There are many rules and regulations, and the masses' creative inventions are criticized for perfection. To propose a rationalization proposal, it is necessary to draw a picture, fill out many forms, and go through more than ten departments and dozens of procedures to get approval. Without liberating the mind from these constraints, it is impossible to have a great leap in technology.

The root of superstition and conservatism is mainly the failure to see the role of people in technological progress and the drowning of the wisdom of the masses. Technology is not something mysterious. It is a summary of production labor practice. Where there is labor and production, there are requirements and possibilities for innovating technology. In the Great Leap Forward, the new creations of the masses are like a hundred flowers blooming and emerging endlessly. In the past, it took nearly two years to design a medium-sized diesel engine factory, but now it only takes more than two months. The gasifier of the gas engine used steel plates in the past. Without steel plates, there was no way. The Tianjin Special Zone boldly replaced it with a brick-built earthen furnace, which not only saves steel but also has high efficiency and has now been widely promoted. A workshop director from a worker background in a Northeast machinery factory researched using oxygen cylinders or steel pipes to make the boiler of a portable boiler, saving half of the steel and half of the coal burned. The main beam of the chassis of a car originally required a 3,500-ton press. During the Great Leap Forward, the Nanjing Automobile Parts Factory did not have such a large press. After workers and engineers found a way, they used a small press to press it in five sections. After testing, it was completely suitable. Numerous examples show that there are countless heroes and heroines among the masses. As long as they are fully mobilized and let them dare to think and dare to do, and guided and improved, talents will surely emerge in large numbers and difficulties will give way. Following the mass line in technical work and making the masses the masters of technology is a fundamental issue in the technological revolution of the mechanical industry.

Giving play to the masses' bold creative spirit does not exclude learning and possessing the world's existing advanced technologies. On the contrary, in order to make technology catch up with the world's advanced level as soon as possible, we must continue to mobilize the masses, do everything possible, and diligently learn and practice to continue to learn and possess more advanced foreign experience in the future. The problem is to combine it with China's actual situation, learning while creating, and combining learning with creation.

In the development of varieties, we must adopt the policy of simultaneously advancing imitation and self-design. On the one hand, we must continue to obtain systematic technical assistance from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, make full use of their drawings or samples, imitate in large quantities, and improve and develop them according to China's actual situation and the experience of production and use. On the other hand, we must adopt the method of first letting a hundred flowers bloom and then sorting and improving them, encouraging bold self-design, and on the basis of a hundred flowers blooming, after field trials, learn from each other's strengths and weaknesses to produce various good machines that combine China's actual situation and gradually form a series of products. At the same time, we must also adopt the method of building up the ranks, where factories with more technical experience help those with less, transferring part of the existing varieties to them and collaborating technically, while striving to improve themselves and make more advanced varieties. Only in this way can the variety come to a great development quickly.

The improvement of technology and production organization is one of the main contents of the current technological revolution movement in enterprises. The masses have created a large number of new tools, transformed old equipment, and innovated the original process methods, and production efficiency has increased dramatically. An important feature of this movement is that it starts from reality, the purpose of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results is clear, and various improvements mostly adopt methods such as making do with whatever is available and using local materials, and the economic effect is very significant. Many companies have basically doubled their production without increasing their plants, equipment, and personnel. Another feature is that the movement has a broad mass nature, and the combination of departments, technicians, and workers has enabled various new technologies to be quickly mastered by the masses and become organizational or technical measures in the factory. This movement correctly solved the problem of the transition of production methods from backward to advanced, and solved the problem of combining technological innovation and economic effects.

Carrying out technological revolution, rapidly developing varieties, and constantly improving technology and production organization all require vigorous development of experimental research work. The policy of experimental research work is to combine popularization and improvement, combine theory and practice, face production, face the masses, and actively master cutting-edge technology. Therefore, research institutions should be close to production units, closely linked to production, and go to the masses to summarize experience and make it rise to the level of theory. Research institutions should be divided according to profession and region. In order to combine foreign advanced technology with the creation of the masses in our country, we must also fully grasp domestic and foreign technical information, fully utilize the scientific research achievements of fraternal countries and other countries, and conduct experimental promotion according to the needs of our country.

It is necessary to resolutely follow the mass line in technical work, and some rules and regulations of the superstructure must be thoroughly reformed. This does not mean that there is nothing worth retaining in all rules and regulations, nor does it mean that technical work can be done without rules and regulations in the future. The problem is that rules and regulations must be practical, both conducive to mass creation and ensure the necessary order in production technical work, and promote the development of productive forces. It is not immutable. It is constantly modified and developed in work practice, reflecting the creative achievements of the masses. It is necessary to make the masses the masters of the rules and regulations, not its slaves. The Qinghua and Jianhua Machinery Factories in Northeast China allowed the masses to directly participate in management work, broke down old regulations, and established rules and regulations that adapt to the great development of productive forces. This initiative is still developing. For rules and regulations, there are those that are abolished and those that are retained, those that are broken and those that are established, and in the future, they must be constantly broken and constantly established. It is necessary to oppose both dogmatism and empiricism, so that the rules and regulations can constantly adapt to and promote the needs of the great development of productive forces.

    生产更多更好的机器保证社会主义建设高速度发展
    第一机械工业部部长　赵尔陆
    任何一个部门、任何一个地方，要加快建设速度，开展技术革命，就要更多更好的机器
    为了十五年赶上英国：第二个五年计划期间需要的各种工业交通设备，比第一个五年计划增加六倍  为了实现全国水利化：需要一千五百万马力排灌机械  为了实现农业机械化：需要五十五万标准台拖拉机、各种农具及农业机械二千万台  为了实现农业初步电气化：需要八百万瓩的发电装备  为了变肩挑背驮为畜力车或动力牵引：需要一亿套滚珠轴承、各种载重汽车几十万辆
    在全民大跃进中，机械制造工业面临的形势是：任何一个部门、任何一个地方，加快建设速度，开展技术革命，都要更多更好的机器。万马奔腾，相互促进，要求机械工业快马加鞭，
  迎头赶上，力争上游，否则就难以保证全国生产与建设跃进规划的实现。
    工业上十五年赶上英国的规划提出以后，冶金设备、电站设备、矿山设备、石油设备、化工设备、交通运输以及轻工业方面的设备需要量，都大大增加了。第二个五年计划期间，整个工业交通设备的需要量，约比第一个五年计划工业交通设备的生产量，增加六倍左右。
    农业纲要四十条，各地都将提前实现。为了实现水利化，全国约需要一千五百万马力的排灌机械。为了基本实现农业机械化，约需要拖拉机五十五万标准台，各种农具及农副业加工机械约需要两千万台以上。在农业电气化方面，如果要达到农村每人拥有电力设备零点零一到零点零二瓩的初步电气化指标（我国农村经过今年的跃进每人只有零点零零一八瓩，日本已达到零点零八瓩），即需农村发电装备八百万瓩。变肩挑、背驮而为畜力车或动力牵引，至少需要滚珠轴承一亿多套以及各种载重汽车几十万辆。
    地方工业的总产值，将提前超过日益增长的农业总产值。今年全国地方工业产值增长速度达到37％以上，许多省份的增长速度超过50％。据估计，第二个五年计划内，一个县建设一批工厂，投资约达一千多万元以上，全国两千多个县，要求供应的机械设备数量就很可观。
    在各方面跃进的同时，机械工业的本身，也必需加速建设新厂、更新设备及进行技术革命，五年内将需要机床几十万台。
    波涛汹涌的建设高潮，成为促进机械工业大发展的激流。要求供应的设备，不仅数量大，而且品种多，时间急。因此，机械工业不能用寻常的速度迈步，而是要以革命的常规，三级跳、翻几翻向前跃进。我国要从农业国变为工业国，从以手工劳动为主的生产方法，转到以现代化机器为主的生产方法，机械工业面临这个光荣而艰巨的任务，人们精神奋发，决心鼓足干劲、力争上游，多、快、好、省地进行生产和建设。
  机械工业必须走在前面
    我们反复研究了毛主席和党中央历次的尤其是最近一个时期的指示，深切体会到：在我们这样一个六亿多人口的大国中，尽快地完成社会主义建设事业，是有何等重大深远的意义。而建设社会主义的根本问题，又是一个高速度发展的问题。
    发展速度，对于机械工业来说，更是一个突出的问题。因为工业部门特别是重工业，要达到跃进的生产指标，都要提前一年、半载安装设备。达到钢铁1962年的生产指标，所需冶金设备要在1961年以前供应，而电站设备更要提早。实现农业跃进指标，为适应农时，也必须提前供应设备。三年水利化所需设备，就要两年内基本上准备好。保证各行业、各地区实现第二个五年计划的指标，大部分设备要集中在前几年供应。此外，还要加上机械工业本身掌握生产的时间和生产周期。因此，机械工业的发展必须走在各部门扩大再生产的前面，走在基本建设的前面。如果不能快马加鞭，迎头赶上，就会耽误各部门、各地方跃进规划的实现。
    机械工业高速度的发展，是完全可能实现的。我们有党中央和毛主席的英明领导，有优越的社会主义制度和我党传统的群众路线；尤其是通过整风，人们解放了思想，正在克服着教条主义、经验主义，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线已经深入人心，生产力大大解放。我们还有苏联、兄弟国家的技术援助，以及各兄弟部门的促进和协作。这些都是实现跃进的基本保证。
    第一个五年计划期内，机械工业建立了初步基础，各行业都有了骨干，这是跃进的立脚点，1957年底，全国已拥有大小工厂二万多个，职工一百七十六万人。在建设上，已经取得了一些经验，五块钱或七块钱可以办十块钱的事，建厂时间也可以压缩一半。有的可以翻版，有的可以用老厂扩建。建设速度可以比前几年快得多。
    今后五年生产的主要新品种为两万多种，要进一步掌握重型、精密仪表、喷气和电子技术等新型产品的生产，补全缺门行业，并适应农业、地方工业多种多样的需要。在产品设计上要由仿造逐步走上改进和独立设计的道路。在这些方面，由于技术力量的薄弱，是有一定困难的。但是，过去几年特别是高潮以来的经验证明，技术也并不是什么神秘的东西，职工群众的创造性发挥起来，又有苏联及兄弟国家的先进技术经验，技术是可以迅速掌握的，问题在于是否走群众路线。在大跃进中，人们以飞速的步伐前进。今年上半年拖拉机已经出了八十多种；汽车已经出了十多种，上海机床厂，今年就计划设计一百种、并试制出四十种精密度要求较高的机床。
    可以设想，像这样的一个万马奔腾的局面，步伐上的参差，一时的失调，是可能出现的。但是只要方向是对的，只要我们能够深入群众，及时检查，采取有效的措施，并且把远大的目标和实事求是的精神结合起来，就一定能够挑起供应全国所需千千万万种设备的重担。
    全国一盘棋
    各区也各有一盘棋
    为了贯彻执行多快好省的总路线，根据工农业并举、中央工业与地方工业并举、大型企业和中小型企业并举的方针，必须全面规划，各级办厂，使各种机械工厂星罗棋布地在全国各地生长起来。这样做，可以发挥全国无穷的人力和物力，既快且省。我国幅员广阔，需要很大，而现有机械工厂太少，地区分布不合理，远远不能适应社会主义建设的要求，因此，形成全国机械工业完整的体系，就十分必要。
    各个经济协作区都拥有几千万至一亿以上的人口，应在下放的机械企业和原有地方机械企业的基础上，逐步形成一个适应本区经济发展需要的机械工业体系。制造一台机械设备，零件往往数以千计，有的需要大型及特殊设备加工，在一个工厂内自己全做是不经济的，需要相互协作。过去，由于全国只有一盘棋，地区内体系不完备，出现了许多不合理的协作。上海的汽轮机轴，要在北满浇钢锭，在沈阳锻打，到太原热处理，再回到上海加工装配。广州做制糖设备的锻铸件和大零件加工，往往要到东北协作。大跃进前，这些关键工艺的协作，已经是门庭若市，顾此失彼；大跃进后，紧张的情况，更可想而知。一个协作件供不上，眼看已有的大批零部件不能装配成套，而且协作遍及全国，运输往返，废时误事，浪费很大，大大地挫伤群众多快好省的积极性。因此，经济协作区必须逐步形成一个较为完整的体系，做到一般的协作可以不出区外。但这并不意味着全国没有完整的体系，今后依然要集合各区的力量，加上一些重点的大型企业，来形成与健全全国机械工业的完整体系。协作区间的协作，仍然是必要的，但是，那只宜于重型的或技术要求较高的协作，因为这些特殊的大型企业，短时间内，还难以每区都有一套。而由于生产的日益发展，技术要求日益提高，全国性的各区间的重大协作，今后还会长期存在，而且还要加强。
    各个经济协作区的机械工业体系，是根据本区经济发展的需要而逐步形成和发展的，要求应当有所不同。各个经济协作区要按照不同条件，从全区考虑，把全区的工厂组织起来，逐步填平补齐，使区内具有机械工业的一些基本行业，比如机床、电站设备、重型和矿山机械、仪表、农业机械、动力机械、电机电器、化工设备、通用机械、配件和滚珠轴承等行业。各区要先后建立起一个几千吨以上水压机的锻造、铸造中心，并具有若干大型加工设备。同时，要根据本区的特点和原有基础，在全国统筹规划及地区合理分布的原则下，突出地发展某些行业，使这些行业成为全国机械工业总体系中的一个基点，分担全国的生产和协作任务。例如，在全国几大冶金基地附近要建立重型机械工业基点；在几个大煤炭基地和“有色金属省”内，要建立矿山机械基点；在沿海建立船舶基点；在技术传统较长、科学技术人才集中的地区要建立高级仪表及精密机械基点。全国电力紧张，电站设备制造能力不足，除建设几个大型的电站设备工厂外，还要立即在几个工业基地翻版建设一些中型电站设备工厂。
    在第二个五年计划内，各省市、自治区应该结合自己的经济特点和资源情况，建立自己的机械工业基础。在几年内，各省都要拥有一个具有一千吨水压机的锻铸中心，和以通用性为主的机械加工力量，建设若干工厂。今后，农业机械，农村电站设备和副业加工机械，需要量大，种类繁多，而又要适应各地不同的经济、自然、作物条件，应该在经济协作区大致分工的原则下，就地取材、就地制造、就地供应。各省所办的小型钢厂、电站、煤矿、化工厂及人造石油厂等设备，只要取得一些大型工厂的协作，也都能自己制造出来。由于农业的半机械化、机械化的迅速发展，农业机具、农村交通运输工具的增加，修配任务将日益增大。人民生活用的机械，大多也宜于在地区内自行供应。上述这几方面的任务，基本上要由本省的机械工业来承担。此外，还要在统一规划之下，分担全区的协作任务；以及为附近的大型工厂承担配件或协作任务。
    机械工业服务面广，品种多，而技术革命的每一阶段，又有不同的设备需要。一个厂要做很多品种，是困难的，反之，专业化范围过于狭窄，又不能适应任务的变化。因此，必须要使地方机械工厂的专业化和万能性相结合。例如：通用机械厂要能够生产轻工业、化学工业、石油工业等多方面的设备。动力机械厂，要既可以供应农业排灌及一般动力机械，又可以供应汽车拖拉机的发动机。将来在这个排灌动力机械的基础上，只要加上配件工厂，就可以装配出汽车拖拉机；这就比建立一个专业的汽车拖拉机工厂经济，而且机动性大，可以适应发展中的需要。
    每县要建设若干个小修造厂，形成修理网，简易的农业机械在县里制造，又修又造；主要是为本县农业生产和农村工业服务。乡、社要建立修配站。修配站在农村遍地开花，就可以使各种农业用的机电设备，做到小修不出乡，大修不出县。
    在建厂的办法上，有几条便捷的道路：其一是扩大改建老厂，充分利用老底子，因陋就简，边生产、边建设；二是必须新建的工厂，可以利用已有的设计，或各种典型设计，经过审核修改以后，进行翻版；三是用试验工厂的办法，在原有小厂中试制，掌握技术以后，再去建厂；四、县的修造厂和乡社的修配站，各地已经出现了许多勤俭办厂、又快又好的典型，设计部门也做了若干标准设计，可以总结、推广。
    发展中央工业与发展地方工业同时并举，是加速工业化与技术革命的一个重大战略。过去我们集中力量搞重点项目，对全面统筹注意不够，思想上有片面性。群众路线和勤俭建国的方针，贯彻得也不够好。原来全国只有一盘棋的作法，已经远远不能适应全面大发展的局势了，必须做到各经济协作区都有一盘棋，集合这许多盘棋，成为全国的棋局。而在那些关键性的非全国力量不能办的一着上，则由中央集中力量建设。只有这样，才能充分调动一切积极因素，既是全面、又有重点地大力发展，形成我国机械工业的完整体系。
    改变体制，面向全国
    整风以来，我们所反复考虑的问题是：如何使我们从大量繁琐的事务主义中解放出来，面向全国，抓住主要的问题，分出更多的力量，来管理地方工业。这就要求我们必须改进工作方法，力求红透专深，坚决烧掉三风五气。同时还必须改变机械工业的体制，下放工厂；体制改变后，就能更好地面向全国，深入群众。
    工厂下放，政治领导与业务领导统一，群众路线能够更充分地贯彻。地方直接领导工厂的生产，便于及时解决问题，在加强协作、挖掘潜力上都大有好处。省、市和经济协作区，还可以用这些下放工厂，作为本区机械工业的骨干，加速发展地方工业。
    经过反复研究，我们拟将第一机械工业部所属的工厂下放到地方去。这样做，最大的好处是可以充分调动一切积极因素，同时，使部和地方的同志，大家同心协力，在统一规划下，全面发展机械工业。机械工业的特点是协作配合复杂，就地的和全国的协作配合都很必要。在同一地区中，如分中央直属与地方管理的两类厂，那么，在安排任务的主次缓急时，都容易带些片面性。而全部下放后，不分界线，能够更全面地考虑问题。
    但是，考虑到省市接管便利，并避免由于青黄不接而引起的一时脱节、失调现象，下放可以分步骤、分行业来实现。当前凡与农业及地方工业发展关系较多的企业，应立即下放。
    现有工厂下放，第二个五年计划的建设项目也要下放。这些新建扩建项目，经中央批准后，由地方领导建设。建成后由地方管理。这样作法的好处是：地方就地管理建设，各方面可以密切配合，又快又省。
    原来经过全国平衡的任务，要随工厂同时下放，使已经形成的分工、协作关系，继续进行，保证成套供应。今后随形势发展，再加调整。下放了工厂和任务，要同时帮助地方充实机电工业的人力，特别是技术力量。因此，准备把中等技术学校、技工学校相应地下放。只有改变体制，部的机构，才能大大精简，抽调一批管理干部和工程技术人员，充实地方。
    四放之后（工厂、建设项目、学校、干部下放），部的责任不是轻松了，而是加重了，必须把工作做好。首先是要管规划。要结合着下放工厂、地区原有基础以及地区经济发展要求，自下而上的提出规划，又从全国出发，自上而下的统筹平衡，共同商定各地机械工业的发展规划。使各地区的机械工业，既能自己独立解决问题，又有相互的依存和协作配合，构成全国体系。
    其次是管平衡。年度任务的产销平衡、协作，总是要为实际情况所修改、调整的。地方直接指挥地区内的生产，可以在国家计划下，就地进行平衡、调度。我们组织重大产品的平衡，和经济协作区之间的协作与差额平衡。
    第三是管技术指导。首先一环是制订技术政策，作为各个行业技术发展的方向。根据这些方向，上下结合，编制技术发展规划。对于规划里的尖端技术和重大新产品，我们要帮助地方和企业采取有力的措施，保证实现。对于促进技术跃进的研究试验工作，要根据技术发展的要求，组织各行业、各地区的力量，形成全国的研究试验网和资料情报网。此外，在百花齐放地发展品种的情况下，要把产品的系列化、部件的通用化和零件的标准化工作，逐步开展起来。
    第四是督促检查、交流经验。定期地和省市一道，组织全面的或重点的检查，及时发现问题，解决问题。经常采取评比、参观、现场会议、展览会等方法，总结经验，组织交流与推广，以收互相促进、共同提高的效果。
    这次体制的改变，四放四管，是生产关系的大变革。我们过去对于依靠群众、依靠地方来发展生产，认识是不深刻的。我们相信，经过这样一番改革，工厂的政治与业务领导更加统一，地方和群众的积极性更加充分地发挥，必将有利于全国机械工业的大发展。
  破除迷信，依靠群众，
    开展技术革命
    机械工业在品种上能否满足各方面的要求，数量上能否提前供应，使用上是否经济，质量上能否给以保证，都将会影响各部门的技术革命。要争取品种的迅速发展、产量的迅速增长、以及提高产品性能、质量和降低成本，都要依靠技术的发展。
    第一个五年计划期间，机械工业掌握了一般机器产品和部分大型、精密产品的制造。今后五年要制造成套大型钢铁厂设备、大容量的电站设备、重型的和精密的机床、仪表以及各种农业机械等。同时，还必须掌握各种尖端技术产品。实现这样一系列的巨大任务，不能不要求机械工业技术大大飞跃，使它在十年左右接近世界先进水平。
    技术跃进的关键在于破除迷信，解放思想，贯彻群众路线，把学习与创造密切结合起来。
    第一个五年计划期间，我们学习苏联和其它兄弟国家的先进经验，依靠他们的技术援助，建成了一批用最新技术装备起来的国外设计工厂，不少老厂的技术装备得到更新，掌握了许多先进技术。通过仿造苏联产品，扩大了品种，锻炼了设计与制造能力。这些对机械工业的技术发展都起了很大的作用。抓紧学习的一面是对的，成绩也是显著的。但是，在学习中存在着生搬硬套的偏向。没有很好地注意学习和创造的密切结合；许多方面把技术神秘化了。产品不分大小、精粗，不论仿造还是自行设计，都要进行三段试制。清规戒律重重，对群众的创造发明求全责备，提一个合理化建议，要画图，要填许多表，要经过十多个科室，走几十道手续，才能得到批准。不从这些束缚里把思想解放出来，要想技术来一个大跃进，是不可能的。
    迷信、保守的根源，主要是看不到技术进步中人的作用，淹没了群众的聪明才智。技术并不是什么神秘的东西，它是生产劳动实践的
  总结，那里有劳动、有生产，那里就有革新技
  术的要求与可能。在大跃进中，群众的新创造
  有如百花怒放、层出不穷。过去设计一个中等
  的柴油机厂要将近两年时间，现在只要两个多
  月时间就可以设计出来。煤气机的发生炉，过去用钢板，没有钢板就没有办法，天津专区大
  胆改用砖砌的土炉子代替，不但省钢材，而且
  效率高，现在已大量推广。东北机械厂一个工人出身的车间主任，研究出用氧气瓶或钢管来
  做锅驼机的锅炉，用钢省一半，烧的煤也少一
  半。汽车底盘的大梁，原来是要用三千五百吨
  大压力机压制，南京汽车制配厂在大跃进中，
  没有这样大的压力机，经过工人与工程师想办法，用小压力机分五段压制，经过试验，
  完全合用。许许多多的例子说明，群众中有无数的英雄好汉，只要充分发动起来，让他们敢想、敢做，加以引导和提高，就一定能够人才
  辈出，困难让路。在技术工作上走群众路线，使群众作技术的主人，这是机械工业技术革命
  中的根本问题。
    发挥群众的大胆创造精神，并不排斥学习和占有世界已有的各种先进技术，相反地，要使技术迅速赶上世界先进水平，今后还要发动群众，千方百计、勤学苦练，继续学习和占有更多的国外先进经验。问题在于要结合我国的实际情况，边学习、边创造，把学习与创造结合起来。
    在发展品种上，要采取仿造与自行设计并进的方针，一方面仍然要继续取得苏联及其他兄弟国家系统的技术援助，充分利用他们的图纸或样品，大量仿造，并根据我国实际情况及生产、使用的经验，加以改进和发展。另一方面，要采取先百花齐放，然后再整理提高的办法，鼓励大胆自行设计，在百花齐放的基础上，经过实地试用，取长补短，产生出结合我国实际的各种良好的机器，逐步形成产品的系列。同时还要采取层层上楼的办法，技术经验较多的工厂，要帮助较差的工厂，把一部分现有的品种，过渡给它，并在技术上给以协作，自己力争提高，做更高级的品种。只有这样，品种才能迅速来一个大发展。
    工艺与生产组织的改善，是目前企业技术革命运动的主要内容之一。群众创造了大批的新工具、改装了旧设备、革新了原有的工艺方法，生产效率突飞猛进。这次运动的一个重要特点，是从现实出发，多快好省的目的性明确，各种改进，大都采取因陋就简、就地取材等办法，经济效果非常显著。许多企业，在厂房、设备、人员基本上没有增加的情况下，生产却提高了一倍左右。另一个特点是运动具有广泛的群众性，科室、技术人员与工人结合，因此各种新技术很快为广大群众所掌握，成为工厂里组织的或技术的措施。这个运动，正确地解决了生产方法从落后向先进过渡的问题，解决了革新技术和经济效果的结合问题。
    开展技术革命，迅速发展品种，不断改进工艺和生产组织，都要求大力发展试验研究工作。试验研究工作的方针，是普及与提高相结合，理论与实践相结合，面向生产，面向群众，积极掌握尖端技术。因此，研究机构要接近生产单位，密切联系生产，到群众中去总结经验，使它上升到理论上来。研究机构应该进行分工，按专业和按地区配备起来。为了使国外先进技术和我国群众创造相结合，还要充分掌握国内外技术情报，充分利用兄弟国家和其它国家的科学研究成果，按照我国的需要情况，来作试验推广。
    要在技术工作中坚决走群众路线，作为上层建筑的一些规章制度，必须来一个彻底的改革。这并不是说所有规章制度当中都没有值得保留的部分，更不是说今后技术工作就可以不要规章制度，问题在于规章制度必须切合实际，既有利于群众创造，而又保证生产技术工作中所必需的秩序，促进生产力的发展。它不是一成不变的，它是在工作实践中不断修改与发展的，体现着群众的创造成果。要使群众成为规章制度的主人，而不是它的奴隶。东北庆华和建华机械厂，让群众直接参加管理工作，破除陈章旧规，建立适应生产力大发展的规章制度，这一创举，目前还在继续发展中。对于规章制度，现在是有废有存，有破有立，今后还要不断地破，不断地立。既要反对教条主义，也要反对经验主义，使规章制度能够不断地适应和推动生产力大发展的需要。
