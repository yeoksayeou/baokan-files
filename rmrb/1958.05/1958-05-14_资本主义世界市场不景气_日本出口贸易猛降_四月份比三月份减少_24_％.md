Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: According to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry on the 12th, Japan's export trade in April decreased by 24% compared to March. The total export trade volume in April was only over 221 million U.S. dollars, a sharp decrease of over 68 million U.S. dollars compared to March.
    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry admitted that Japan is no exception to the overall recession of the capitalist world economy.
    The Ministry of International Trade and Industry said that the decline in export trade in April affected all products, with the export volume of oils and ships being the most severely affected, decreasing by 85% and 45% respectively. Exports of textiles to Southeast Asian countries and timber exports to the dollar area also decreased significantly.
    The Japan Rubber Industry Association also announced on the 12th that due to the decrease in the number of automobile tires purchased by Southeast Asian countries, Japan's automobile tire exports in April were only 1,188,800 U.S. dollars, a decrease of approximately 70,000 U.S. dollars compared to March.
    An article published in the Japanese magazine "Economist" in late April pointed out that the current economic crisis in the United States is more serious than the situations in 1948-49 and 1953-54. Economically backward countries, especially Southeast Asian countries, lack foreign exchange, so it is difficult to expect Japan to have a large amount of exports to these countries. Except for West Germany, Western European countries are reducing imports and desperately seeking export markets. International competition will be more intense in the future, so it is also difficult for Japan to increase exports to Western Europe. The future trend of the capitalist world economy will inevitably be affected by the United States. If the United States raises tariffs and actively restricts the import of foreign goods in the future, Japan's exports will further deteriorate, and the dollar shortage in other capitalist countries will become more serious.
    The magazine said that it is not easy for Japan to find export markets, so the Japanese government's target of 3.15 billion U.S. dollars in exports for this year is completely impossible to achieve.

    资本主义世界市场不景气
　　日本出口贸易猛降
    四月份比三月份减少24％
    新华社13日讯　东京消息：据日本通商产业省12日宣布，日本4月份出口贸易额比3月份减少了24％。4月份出口贸易总额仅二亿二千一百多万美元，比3月份激减了六千八百多万美元。
    通商产业省承认，在资本主义世界经济总衰退中，日本不能例外。
    通商产业省说，4月份出口贸易的衰退影响到一切产品，油脂和船舶的出口量受到最严重的影响，它们分别减少了85％和45％。运往东南亚各国的纺织品和输出到美元地区的木材也减少了很多。
    日本橡胶工业协会12日也宣布，由于东南亚各国购买汽车轮胎数量减少，日本在4月份输出汽车轮胎只有一百一十八万八千美元，比3月份减少了约七万美元。
    日本“经济学人”杂志在4月下旬刊载一篇文章曾经指出，目前美国的经济危机比1948—49年以及1953—54年的情况还要严重。经济落后国家特别是东南亚国家缺乏外汇，因此很难指望日本对这些国家有大量的出口，西欧各国除了西德以外，都减少进口而拼命找出口市场，今后的国际竞争更加激烈，因此日本增加对西欧的出口也有困难。今后资本主义世界经济的动向不得不受美国的影响，如果美国今后提高关税，积极限制外国商品进口，那末日本的出口将更加恶化，其他资本主义国家美元不足的情况将要更加严重。
    这家杂志说，日本要寻找出口市场是不容易的，因此日本政府规定本年度出口三十一亿五千万美元的目标完全无法完成。
