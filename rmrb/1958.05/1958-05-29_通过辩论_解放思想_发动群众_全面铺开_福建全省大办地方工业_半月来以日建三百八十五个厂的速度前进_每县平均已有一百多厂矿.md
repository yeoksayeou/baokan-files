Title: Through Debate, Liberate Thought, Mobilize the Masses, Fully Unfold: Fujian Province Vigorously Develops Local Industry; Advancing at a Rate of 385 Factories Built Per Day for the Past Half-Month; Each County Already Averages Over 100 Factories and Mines

Fujian Daily reporter reports: Local industries below the county level in Fujian Province have implemented the policy of "the whole Party and the whole people running industry, focusing on small-scale, and blooming everywhere," and adopted the method of "starting with abstract discussions and boldly mobilizing the masses." In May, a surge of the whole Party and the whole people running factories emerged. In the past half-month, it has been advancing rapidly at a rate of 385 factories and mines built per day, establishing more than 5,700 small factories and mines. Now, each county averages 111 factories and mines, and many counties that previously had no local industry have seen their first batch of flowers bloom.

The upsurge of industry run by townships, villages and communes developed rapidly in May. After the Provincial Party Committee held a provincial telephone conference on the 8th of this month, calling on all the people to run factories, many counties, just like in the past when engaging in large-scale agricultural production, convened four-level cadre meetings. Starting with "abstract" discussions, they launched thematic debates on "whether or not to run industry," "whether or not it is possible to run industry," and "who to rely on to run it." Through debate, the three main thoughts of county, district, township, and commune cadres were resolved: First, the idea of "seeing things but not people" was overcome, where at the mention of running factories, people just asked for help from above, not believing in or relying on the masses; second, the erroneous understanding of "seeing big but not small" was corrected, where people only wanted to run big factories and looked down on small factories; third, mysterious views were broken, and the superstitious idea that technology was too difficult to reach and that factories could only be run in cities was eliminated. The solution of these ideological problems invigorated the fearless spirit of creation, forming a vigorous high tide of the whole people running industry.

With thought liberated and the masses mobilized, a series of problems such as funds, technology, and materials for running industry were readily solved. When funds were insufficient, various localities mobilized local industrial deposits and savings. A cooperative in Dongxiao Township, Longyan County, raised 90,000 yuan in funds. Women in two overseas Chinese hometowns in Jinjiang County raised more than 100 taels of gold. They said, "Gold is lovely, but the industrialization of the motherland is even more lovely." Where technical strength was insufficient, various localities generally adopted two solutions: One was to return technical personnel to their posts, bringing together farmers who had worked in factories and mines before, migrant workers who had built the Yingxia Railway, soldiers demobilized from the army with certain skills, plus rural craftsmen and local experts, to form a technical team. Dongxiao Township in Longyan built five factories and mines in three days, including two coal factories with more than eighty workers, which were formed according to the above method. The other was to "train people in whatever is being done," sending people to visit and learning on the spot, becoming a rapid method for training junior technicians on a large scale. Over the past half-month, counties across the province have trained 1,500 people. Many materials can be obtained locally and solved by using substitutes.

An important feature of the rapid development of local industry in Fujian is "planning, acting, building factories, and producing at the same time" and "holding up typical examples and fully promoting them." For example, a commune in Minhou County built a fertilizer factory. The district committee organized all the communes in the district to visit it. In just a few days, the entire district built fifteen similar factories. Then, the county committee organized the entire county to visit and learn from this district. By May 16, the entire county had built 168 fertilizer factories of various types.

After local industries bloomed everywhere, it proved that the avenues for small-scale industries are extremely wide. According to statistics, there are now more than fifty types. Mining small mines alone includes thirteen types such as iron, coal, copper, aluminum, tungsten, manganese, and crystal. There are also four types of power: water, electricity, biogas, and wind power. Among the factories and mines that have already been built, agricultural tools, fertilizers, and pesticides account for 64.5%, and power accounts for 15.7%, indicating that these small-scale industries are closely focused on serving agricultural production. Therefore, the great leap forward in local industry will inevitably promote the great leap forward in agricultural production in turn.

    通过辩论　解放思想　发动群众　全面铺开
    福建全省大办地方工业
    半月来以日建三百八十五个厂的速度前进　每县平均已有一百多厂矿
    本报讯　福建日报记者报道：福建省县以下的地方工业，贯彻了“全党全民办工业，小型为主，遍地开花”的方针，采取了“谈虚入手，放手发动群众”的方法，5月份出现了全党全民办工厂的热潮。半个月以来以日建三百八十五个厂矿的速度飞速前进，建立起五千七百多个小型厂矿，现在每县平均已有一百一十一个厂矿，很多过去地方工业空白的县份，开出了第一批花朵。
    乡乡社社办工业的热潮，是5月份迅速发展起来的。省委于本月8日召开全省电话会议，号召全民办厂后，许多县就像以往搞农业大生产一样，召开四级扩干会，从谈“虚”入手，展开“要不要办工业”、“能不能办工业”、“依靠谁来办”等专题辩论。通过辩论，解决了县、区、乡、社干部的三个主要思想：一是克服了“见物不见人”，一提办工厂，就伸手向上要，不相信、不依靠群众的思想；二是纠正了“见大不见小”，只愿办大厂，看不起小厂的错误认识；三是打破了神秘观点，铲除了过去认为技术高不可攀，工厂只有城市才能办的迷信思想。这些思想问题的解决，就振奋了大无畏的创造精神，形成轰轰烈烈的全民办工业的高潮。
    思想解放、群众发动起来，办工业的资金、技术、材料等一系列问题，就都迎刃而解。资金不够，各地就发动地方工业存款储蓄。龙岩县东萧乡一个合作社就筹集了九万元资金，晋江县有二个侨乡的妇女筹集了一百多两黄金，她们说，“黄金可爱，祖国的工业化更可爱”。技术力量不足，各地一般采取了两个解决办法：一是技术人才归队，把从前在厂矿做过工的农民、修筑过鹰厦铁路的民工、部队复员的有一定技能的士兵，再加上农村中手工业者、土专家，组成一支技术队伍。龙岩东萧乡三天内办起五个厂矿，其中两个煤厂八十多工人，就是按上述办法组成的。再是“搞什么，就训练什么”，派人参观，就地学习成为一种大规模训练初级技术人员的速成法。全省各县半月来已训练出一千五百人。许多材料，都能就地取材，及利用代用品而获得解决。
    福建地方工业飞速发展的一个重要特点是“边规划、边行动、边建厂、边生产”和“高举典型、全面推开”。如闽侯县有一个社建成一个肥料厂，区委组织了全区各社去参观，只有几天，全区就办起了十五个同样的厂，接着县委组织全县到这个区参观学习，到5月16日，全县就办起一百六十八个各种类型的肥料厂。
    地方工业遍地开花之后，证明小型工业的门路极为宽广，据统计现已有五十余种，仅开采小矿，就有铁、煤、铜、铝、钨、锰、水晶等十三种，动力也有水、电、沼气、风力四种。已经办起来的厂矿中，农具、肥料、农药等就占了64.5％，动力占15.7％，说明这些小型工业，紧紧围绕着服务于农业生产，因此，地方工业的大跃进，反过来又必然促进农业生产的大跃进。
