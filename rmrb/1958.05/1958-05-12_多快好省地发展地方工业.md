　　A massive upsurge in running local industries is taking shape across the country. Not only all provinces but also many special districts, counties, and even townships have put forward active leap forward plans: striving to make the total output value of local industries exceed the total output value of agriculture in about five years. In many places, with the enthusiastic support of the masses, they are doing what they say, and small factories, mines, and power stations are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. Once this enthusiasm for running local industries is developed, it generates tremendous energy like nuclear fission, creating a new scene of ten thousand horses galloping on China's industrial front.

　　For a long time, China's industry has been in a backward state. From the official ordnance factory (1862) and Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau (1865) during the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty to before liberation, not only was heavy industry scarce, but even light industry, with the exception of the textile industry, was underdeveloped. Overall, modern industry was incomplete and its foundation was extremely weak. This was one of the important reasons for China's poverty, backwardness, and suffering from imperialist bullying for many years. Imperialism, bureaucratic capitalism, and feudalism severely restricted the development of China's modern industry. Since liberation, after three years of recovery and five years of construction, and after socialist transformation, China's industry has greatly developed, many new industrial sectors have been established, and the preliminary foundation for industrialization has been laid. However, the existing level of industry is extremely disproportionate compared to China as a large country with a population of 600 million, and even the output of major industrial products lags behind many countries in the world. Whether from the domestic or international situation, or from the economic or political situation, the greatest interest of the Chinese people is to develop industry as quickly as possible and to realize socialist industrialization as early as possible. China has abundant resources and a large labor force, has established a number of modern industries and accumulated considerable experience in industrial construction during the first five-year plan, and has the assistance of the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries in China's industrial construction, coupled with the wise leadership of the Party and the hard work and courage of the people. China has the conditions to carry out industrialization at the fastest speed. The question is how to make China's industrialization leap forward at the fastest speed.

　　This is a major issue related to the general line of China's socialist construction. As early as April 1956, Comrade Mao Zedong, in his report on "Ten Major Relationships" at the meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Party, put forward the correct principles very brilliantly. In this report, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the relationship between heavy industry and light industry and agriculture. To develop heavy industry as quickly as possible, it is necessary to vigorously develop agriculture, that is, to put forward the principle of developing industry and developing agriculture simultaneously. This means that while rapidly developing industry, it is necessary to rapidly develop agriculture. This provides a reliable guarantee for industrialization in terms of raw materials, markets, labor, and capital. As for how industry itself can develop rapidly, Comrade Mao Zedong put forward the principle of developing central industries (mainly large enterprises) and developing local industries (mainly small and medium-sized enterprises) simultaneously in this report. This principle was put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong based on the experience of industrial construction at home and abroad, especially the experience of China's industrial construction during the first five-year plan. During the first five-year plan, we focused on developing industries managed by the central government, which was absolutely necessary. Due to the rapid development of industries managed by the central government, China has laid a preliminary foundation for industrialization in a short period of time. During this period, due to the fact that socialist transformation had not yet been completed, and that we subjectively did not pay enough attention to local industries, the development of local industries was relatively slow. During the first five-year plan, we paid close attention to building large enterprises, but we did not pay enough attention to small and medium-sized enterprises. In the past, there was a view that only large enterprises were economical, and small and medium-sized enterprises were not cost-effective. In fact, this does not conform to the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Of course, it is necessary to build large enterprises, which are the backbone of China's industrialization. In the future, it will still be necessary to build various large-scale modern enterprises. However, large enterprises alone are not enough, and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises must also be established. Because small and medium-sized enterprises do not require large investments and are easy to set up in a decentralized manner; construction time is shorter and they can be put into production more quickly. It can be envisioned that in the future, in addition to developing central industries, if the enthusiasm of all parts of the country for running industries is mobilized, and local industries are run on a large scale, and a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises are established in addition to large enterprises, China's industry can develop at a high speed.

　　The industrial construction line put forward by Chairman Mao is a line that mobilizes all positive factors to run industry, and is a line that liberates the productive forces. Developing central industries and local industries simultaneously is to liberate the restrictions on running local industries; developing large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises simultaneously is to liberate the restrictions on developing small and medium-sized enterprises! All of these are mutually combined and mutually promoted. This is the concrete path for China's high-speed industrialization.

　　Now there are more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions, more than 180 special districts and autonomous prefectures, more than 2,000 counties, and more than 80,000 townships in the country. If each province and autonomous region, each special district, each county, and even each township runs industry, the total number in the country will be considerable. One of our provinces is larger than many countries in Europe. Belgium in Europe has a population of only over 8.9 million and an area of only over 30,000 square kilometers, but its annual steel output reaches over 6 million tons. China will only be able to catch up with it this year. If all of China's more than 20 provinces and autonomous regions actively run industry, and struggle for 10 or 20 years, there is no reason why the country's steel output should not reach ten or twenty times larger than Belgium's.

　　Facts have proven that to develop industry in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to develop central industries and local industries simultaneously, and to develop large enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises simultaneously, that is, in addition to the central government running large enterprises, it is also necessary to fully utilize the enthusiasm of local governments for running small and medium-sized enterprises. This principle put forward by Comrade Mao Zedong has been clearly affirmed by the Eighth National Congress of the Party held in September 1956. The Third Plenary Session of the Party held in October 1957 also decided to change the management system of industry, commerce, and finance, and to delegate a large part of the power originally managed by the central government to local governments. All of these, coupled with the struggle against conservatism and waste in the rectification movement, have greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of local governments for running industry. The central government runs large industries, and the provinces, special districts, counties, and townships run small and medium-sized industries. Under the conditions of overall planning, division of labor and cooperation, and simultaneous development, it is also the mass line of running industry.

　　The facts of the past few months have shown that once the enthusiasm of local governments for running industry is brought into play, it immediately generates tremendous material strength. According to preliminary statistics, Gansu, Shanxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hunan, Henan, and other provinces all plan to increase their total industrial output value this year by more than 50% compared to last year; the growth rate of local industries nationwide this year may reach more than 37%. Gansu Province, which has always been relatively barren, has raised more funds in a short period of dozens of days than the state's total investment in local industries over the past three years, in order to run industry. The more industrially backward the region, the higher the enthusiasm for running industry. People can see how exciting the matter of running industry is to the hearts of the people across the country.

　　According to the results of recent research by relevant central departments, the potential for developing local small and medium-sized industries is very large, and the future is very encouraging. It is estimated that in those counties with resource conditions (mainly coal and iron), it is entirely possible to build at least a small coal mine, a small chemical fertilizer plant, a small coal-to-oil plant, a small iron smelting plant, a small cement plant, a small power station, and a mechanical joint repair shop in a few years. The total investment for building the above batch of factories is about 12 million yuan. For a county, it is not very difficult to raise this amount of funds in about five years or a little longer, but with this batch of factories, the county can achieve industrialization. China has more than 2,000 counties. According to known resource conditions, there are more than 400 counties with coal mine resources and more than 200 counties with iron ore resources. If each county establishes such an industry, the speed of China's industrialization can be greatly accelerated, and it will be fully possible to build our motherland into a strong industrial country as soon as possible.

　　The task of local industries is to serve agriculture (this is basic); to serve the national large industries; to serve the lives of urban and rural people; and to serve exports (mainly processing agricultural products and producing local specialties). In order to achieve this task, it is first necessary to break the mysterious view of industrialization, the whole Party runs industry, and all levels run industry, and resolutely take the mass line. Among the cadres at all levels below the county level, it should be advocated to learn how to run cooperatives and how to run factories. All provinces and autonomous regions should strive to make the total output value of local industries exceed the total output value of agriculture in five to seven years while vigorously realizing the agricultural leap forward plan.

　　When planning the development of local industries, all localities should pay attention to the following issues.

　　First, running local industries requires overall planning and strengthened leadership. There should be a general division of labor and cooperation in industrial production based on the resource conditions and existing industrial base of each region. Not only should the whole country have a general plan, but each province and autonomous region should also have a general plan. At the same time, based on the economy of local industries in various places, the layout of local industries should generally rely on existing industrial cities as technical centers, select several county towns as the base points for linking industrial cities and local industries in various counties, and widely establish a cooperation system between regions and between enterprises to form an industrial network that combines points and surfaces, and combines large, medium, and small enterprises. All localities can make arrangements according to their local conditions.

　　Second, the development of local industries should implement the principle of running enterprises diligently and thriftily. Factory buildings and equipment should be simple and crude, making full use of existing materials and manpower, and striving to spend less money and do more things.

　　Third, when establishing new enterprises, priority should be given to establishing industries that serve agriculture and large industries. The industries that serve the urban and rural people should be developed appropriately according to the resources and sales conditions. The scale of new enterprises should generally be based on small and medium-sized enterprises. The industries below the county level are basically small-scale, facing the countryside, and serving the agricultural production of the county.

　　Fourth, the funds for local industrial construction, in addition to the larger and more important construction projects mainly invested by the central government, the funds required for other general construction projects should be mainly raised by the local governments themselves. The sources of local funds mainly rely on local financial fundraising, the internal accumulation of local enterprises, and the accumulation of handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives. This year, due to the fact that agricultural cooperatives and the vast number of farmers have already invested a large amount of funds in water conservancy construction, it is generally not advisable to raise too much industrial construction funds from them again. When raising industrial funds, it is also necessary to resolutely implement the principle that the development of industry must be carried out simultaneously with the development of agriculture, and do not reduce the necessary investment in agriculture because of fundraising for industry.

　　Fifth, the forms of local industries below the county level can be diverse, and can be roughly divided into county-run, township-run, county-cooperative or township-cooperative, cooperative-run, and other forms. The small-scale industries run by agricultural cooperatives are mainly for self-production and self-use, such as the repair of agricultural tools, the processing and manufacture of farm fertilizers, and the processing of small amounts of agricultural products. Generally speaking, small-scale industries in rural areas are best to take the form of county-cooperative or township-run. Among the county-run industries, it is best to have a joint factory that operates a variety of businesses. This type of factory is easier to adapt to the seasonality of agriculture, and can flexibly and uniformly adjust labor, use technical equipment, and working capital, and can become the core of the rural industrial network.

　　Sixth, when developing local industries, it is also necessary to conduct a thorough investigation and ranking of the existing enterprises, give full play to the potential of existing enterprises, and expand or renovate them as needed. At the same time, handicrafts should also be reorganized and developed. Priority should be given to developing handicraft production that serves local agricultural production and people's lives. Secondly, special handicraft products that meet the needs of domestic and foreign markets should also be actively developed.

　　Seventh, in view of the fact that this year, all localities will concentrate their financial, material, and human resources on the great leap forward in agriculture, this year, all localities can develop more small-scale enterprises that are small in scale, require less investment, are quick to build, and have great results, especially small enterprises that manufacture improved agricultural tools, repair and assemble agricultural machinery, and mine non-ferrous metals and small coal kilns; while for other industries that require larger investments and are more technically complex, this year, we should focus on making preparations and start trial-running several small and medium-sized enterprises in the provinces and autonomous regions, in order to gain experience and create conditions for future large-scale development.

　　The beautiful scenery of our motherland's industrialization, which makes people's hearts bloom, has been displayed in front of us. The achievements of the great leap forward have crushed the low-key arguments of all pessimists and skeptics with iron-like facts. We should go all out, strive for the upstream, develop local industries in a greater, faster, better, and more economical way, let local industries bloom all over the country, and enable our country to realize socialist industrialization as soon as possible.

　　多快好省地发展地方工业
    一个声势浩大的办地方工业的高潮正在全国形成。不仅是全国各省，而且许多专区、县以至乡，都提出了积极的跃进计划：力争在五年左右的时间内，使地方工业的总产值超过农业的总产值。很多地方在群众的热情支持下，说干就干，小型厂矿和电站雨后春笋地发展起来。这种办地方工业的积极性一经发扬，就像原子核分裂一样，产生了巨大的能量，使我国工业战线上出现了一个万马奔腾的新局面。
    我国工业长时期以来处在落后的状态中。从清朝同治年间官办制炮局（1862年）、江南制造局（1865年）开始，直到解放之前，不但重工业少得可怜，即便是轻工业也只是纺织工业稍为发达，整个来说，现代工业残缺不全，基础极其薄弱，这是我国多年贫困、落后、备受帝国主义欺凌的重要的原因之一。而帝国主义、官僚资本主义、封建主义又重重束缚着我国近代工业的发展。解放以来，经过了三年恢复和五年建设，经过了社会主义改造，我国的工业有了很大发展，许多新的工业部门建立起来了，工业化的初步基础奠定了。但是，已有的工业水平，同我国作为一个拥有六亿人口的大国比较起来是极不相称的，即使就主要工业品的产量来说也落在世界上许多国家后面。无论从国内或者国际形势来看，无论从经济或者政治情况来看，我国人民的最大利益是尽快地发展工业，尽早地实现社会主义工业化。我国拥有丰富的资源和众多的人力，第一个五年计划期间已经建立起一批现代工业和已经积累了相当丰富的工业建设的经验，苏联及其他兄弟国家对我国工业建设的援助，加上党的英明领导和人民群众的勤劳勇敢，我国以最快的速度进行工业化的条件是具备的。问题在于怎样才能使我国工业化以最快的速度向前飞跃。
    这是一个关系我国社会主义建设总路线的重大问题。早在1956年4月间，毛泽东同志在党的中央政治局会议上所作的关于“十大关系”的报告中，已经十分英明地提出了正确的原则。毛泽东同志在这个报告中提出了重工业和轻工业、农业的关系，要想尽快地发展重工业，就必须大力发展农业，就是说，提出了发展工业和发展农业同时并举的原则。这就是说，在迅速发展工业的同时，必须迅速发展农业。这就使工业化在原料、市场、劳动力以及资金方面获得可靠的保证。至于工业本身如何才能迅速发展，毛泽东同志在这个报告中提出了发展中央工业（主要是大型企业）和发展地方工业（主要是中小型企业）同时并举的原则。这个原则是毛泽东同志根据国内外工业建设的经验，特别是我国在第一个五年计划期间工业建设的经验而提出来的。在第一个五年计划期间，我们着重注意了发展中央管理的工业，这是完全必要的，由于中央管理的工业的迅速发展，我国在短短的时间内已打下了工业化的初步基础。在这期间，由于社会主义改造尚未完成，以及我们主观上对地方工业注意得不够，地方工业的发展是比较慢的。第一个五年计划期间，对兴办大型企业是抓紧了的，但对中小型企业就注意不够了。过去有一种看法，认为只有大型企业是经济的，中小型企业不合算，实际上这是不合乎多快好省的方针的。当然，兴办大型企业是必要的，这是我国工业化的骨干，今后仍然需要兴办各种大型的现代化的企业，但是，只有大型企业是不够的，还必须大量举办中、小型企业。因为中小型企业投资不大，易于分散来办；建设时间较短，可以较快地投入生产。可以设想，今后在发展中央工业之外，把全国各地办工业的积极性统统调动起来，大办地方工业，在大型企业之外，还大量办中小型企业，我国工业就可以高速度地向前发展。
    毛主席所提出的工业建设的路线，是调动一切积极因素办工业的路线，是解放生产力的路线。中央工业和地方工业同时并举，这就是解放了对办地方工业的束缚；大型企业和中小型企业同时并举，这就是解放了对发展中小型企业的束缚！所有这些，都是相互结合、相互促进的。这是我国高速度地工业化的具体道路。
    现在全国有二十几个省和自治区，一百八十多个专区、自治州，两千多个县，八万多个乡。每个省和自治区、每个专区、每个县以至每个乡都办工业，全国加起来就是一个很可观的数目。我们的一个省就比欧洲的许多国家大。欧洲的比利时，人口只有八百九十多万，面积只有三万多平方公里，但钢的年产量达六百多万吨，我国今年才能赶过它。如果我国二十几个省和自治区都大家来积极办工业，奋斗十年、二十年，全国钢产量没有理由不达到较比利时大十倍、二十倍。
    事实证明，要多快好省地发展工业，必须中央工业和地方工业同时并举，大型企业和中、小型企业要同时并举，就是说，除中央举办大型企业以外还要充分发挥地方举办中、小型企业的积极性。毛泽东同志提出的这个原则，已经为在1956年9月间举行的党的第八次全国代表大会明确肯定了。1957年10月举行的党的三中全会，又决定了改变工业、商业和财政的管理体制，把原来由中央管理的很大一部分权力下放给地方。所有这些，加上整风运动反保守、反浪费的斗争大大激发了地方办工业的积极性。中央办大工业，省、专区、县、乡办中小型工业，在全面规划、分工协作的条件下，同时并举，也是办工业的群众路线。
    几个月来的事实表明：地方办工业的积极性一经发挥，立即产生了巨大的物质力量。根据初步统计，甘肃、山西、云南、贵州、湖南、河南等省，都计划把今年的工业总产值比去年提高50％以上；全国地方工业今年增长的速度，可能达到37％以上。一向是比较贫瘠的甘肃省，人民为了兴办工业，在短短的数十天内，就筹集了比过去三年来国家对地方工业总投资还要多的资金。越是工业比较落后的地区，办工业的积极性就越高。人们可以看到，兴办工业这件事情是怎样的激动全国人民的心弦。
    最近中央有关部门研究的结果，发展地方中小型工业的潜力是很大的，前途十分令人振奋。据估计，在那些资源条件（主要是煤和铁）具备的县份，不用几年，完全有可能至少建设一个小的煤矿、一个小的化学肥料厂、一个小的煤炼油厂、一个小的炼铁厂、一个小的水泥厂、一个小的电站，和一个机械联合修理厂。建设以上一批工厂，总共投资约为一千二百万元上下，以一个县来说，在五年左右或更多一点的时间内，筹集这笔资金并不是很困难的，可是有了这一批工厂，就可以做到这个县实现工业化。我国有两千多个县，根据已知的资源情况，有煤矿资源的有四百多个县，有铁矿资源的有二百多个县。如果每个县都建立起这样的工业，我国工业化的速度就可以大大加快，就有充分可能提早把我们的祖国建设成为一个强大的工业国。
    地方工业的任务是为农业服务（这是基本的）；为国家大工业服务；为城乡人民生活服务；为出口服务（主要是加工农产品和生产土特产品）。为了实现这个任务，首先需要打破对于工业化的神秘观点，全党办工业、各级办工业，坚决走群众路线。在县以下的各级干部中，应该提倡既要学会办社，又要学会办厂。各省、自治区应该在大力实现农业跃进规划的同时，争取在五年到七年的时间内，使地方工业的总产值超过农业总产值。
    各地在规划发展地方工业的时候，应注意以下的几个问题。
    第一，办地方工业需要全面规划，加强领导。应该根据各地区的资源情况和现有工业基础，对工业生产有一个大体的分工协作。不仅全国要有一个大致的规划，各省、自治区也要有一个大致的规划。同时，根据各地办地方工业的经济，地方工业的布局一般要依托现有工业城市作为技术中心，选择若干县城作为联结工业城市和各县地方工业的基点，并在地区之间、企业之间广泛建立协作制度，形成点面结合、大中小企业结合的工业网。各地可以根据当地具体条件进行安排。
    第二，发展地方工业应该贯彻执行勤俭办企业的方针，厂房设备应该因陋就简，充分利用现有物力、人力，力争少花钱多办事。
    第三，建立新的企业，应该首先注意兴办为农业和为大工业服务的工业。为城乡人民服务的工业，应该根据资源和销路的情况适当发展。新建企业的规模，一般应以中、小型企业为主，县以下的工业基本上是办小型的，面向农村，为本县的农业生产服务。
    第四，地方工业建设的资金，除了较大的重要建设项目主要由中央投资以外，其他一般建设项目所需的资金，主要应该由地方自筹来解决。地方资金的来源，主要依靠地方财政筹集，地方企业的内部积累，手工业合作社和农业社的积累。今年，由于农业社和广大农民投资于水利建设的资金已经为数很大，一般不宜再过多地向他们筹集工业建设资金。在筹集工业资金时，也要坚决贯彻执行发展工业必须和发展农业同时并举的方针，不要因为集资办工业而减少对农业的必要投资。
    第五，县以下地方工业的形式，可以是多种多样的，大体上可以分为县营，乡营，县、社合营或乡、社合营，合作社营等形式。农业社办的小型工业，以自产自用的为主，如农具的修理，农家肥料的加工制造，小量的农产品加工等。一般地说，农村中的小型工业，以采取县、社合营或乡营的形式为好。县营工业中最好有一个经营多种业务的联合工厂，这种工厂比较易于适应农业的季节性，可以灵活统一地调剂劳动力、使用技术设备和流动资金，并且可以成为农村工业网的核心。
    第六，在发展地方工业的时候，还要对现有企业的情况进行摸底排队，充分发挥现有企业的潜力，根据需要加以扩建或改建。同时，对于手工业也要进行整理和发展，首先应该注意发展为当地农业生产和人民生活服务的手工业生产，其次还应当积极发展为国内外市场的需要的特种手工业产品。
    第七，鉴于今年各地的财力、物力、人力要集中用于农业大跃进，因此，今年各地可以多发展那些规模小、投资少、建设快、收效大，特别是制造改良农具、修配农业机械、开采有色金属和小煤窑等小型企业；而对其它投资较大、技术较复杂的工业，今年应着重做好准备，在省和自治区内开始试办几个中小型企业，以便取得经验，为今后大发展创造条件。
    令人心花怒放的祖国工业化的美景已经展示在我们的前面。大跃进的成就已用铁一般的事实粉碎了一切悲观论和怀疑论者的低调。我们应当鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地发展地方工业，让地方工业在全国遍地开花，使我国尽快地实现社会主义工业化。
