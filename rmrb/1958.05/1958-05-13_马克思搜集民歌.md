　　Marx Collected Folk Songs
    There are many people in the world who appreciate the characteristics and natural beauty of folk songs. Our great revolutionary teacher Karl Marx was one of the most outstanding connoisseurs of folk poetry. When he was still in university, he was already collecting, researching, and selecting outstanding works from folk songs of various ethnic groups. He personally copied many folk songs into a commemorative album. On the commemorative album, he wrote: "These folk songs are excerpts I have taken from folk song selections from Germany (various dialects across the country), Spain, Greece, Latvia, Lapland, Estonia, and Albania, etc." In 1839, he gifted this commemorative album to his fiancée, Jenny von Westphalen.
    Below is a folk song collected by Marx:
    Dove (Roman Folk Song)
    Blue dove, where are you flying?
    Please fly slowly near me,
    Drop a feather for me,
    So I can write a letter to my girl far away.
    I dip the feather in hot blood,
    And carve my heart into the letter.
    This letter is full of sincere love,
    Please deliver it to the one in my heart.
    If she is still sleeping soundly,
    Leave the letter and fly away quietly.
    Marx's example of collecting folk songs is a good model for us today. Our country is very rich in folk songs, and various places have recently compiled them into small booklets. In the future, we should create, collect, compile, and print folk songs more universally and extensively.

　　马克思搜集民歌
    世界上有许多鉴赏民歌特点和自然美的人，我们伟大的革命导师卡尔·马克思就是民间诗歌创作的最卓越的鉴赏家之一。当他还在大学上学时期，就已在搜集、研究、选择各族民歌中的优秀作品。他把许多民歌亲手抄在一本纪念册中。在纪念册上写着：“这些民歌是我从德国（全国各种方言）、西班牙、希腊、拉脱维亚、拉普兰、爱沙尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚等民歌选集中摘录下来的。”1839年，他把这本纪念册赠给了自己的未婚妻燕妮·维斯特法琳。
    下面就是马克思搜集的一首民歌：
    鸽子（罗马民歌）
    蓝色鸽子，你飞向何方？
    请缓缓飞到我的近旁，
    给我丢下一支羽毛，
    好让我写信给远方姑娘。
    我用羽毛蘸上热血，
    在信上刻划我的心。
    这封信饱藏着诚挚的爱，
    请你捎给我心上的人。
    如果她甜睡还没醒来，
    请留下信，悄悄飞开。
    马克思搜集民歌的事例，正是我们今天的好榜样。我国民歌非常丰富，各地近来已经陆续收编成小册子。今后还应该更普遍地更多地创造民歌，搜集民歌，编印民歌。
