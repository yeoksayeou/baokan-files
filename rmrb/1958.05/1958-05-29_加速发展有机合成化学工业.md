Xinhua News Agency, 28th Dispatch: Organic synthesis chemical industry will become a key focus of China's overall industrial development in the future. Currently, the Ministry of Chemical Industry is taking a series of measures to lay a solid foundation for this blank spot in China's industry during the Second Five-Year Plan, striving to catch up with British production levels within ten years.

Accelerating the establishment and development of this new industrial sector will greatly promote the development of China's industrial and agricultural production and help improve the people's living standards.

According to the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has recently repeatedly studied the development direction of the organic synthesis industry and revised the original conservative plan, increasing the production targets for major organic synthesis chemical products such as plastics, synthetic rubber, synthetic fibers, and synthetic detergents in 1962 by two to four times. In order to enable the organic synthesis chemical industry, which was not given due development during the First Five-Year Plan, to catch up quickly, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has adopted the policy of first developing several major varieties such as polyvinyl chloride, amino plastics, caprolon, and chloroprene rubber in large quantities. These varieties are currently urgently needed for industrial and agricultural production and people's lives, and most finished products are inexpensive, suitable for the consumption levels of the broad masses of people. Furthermore, the construction policy of combining large, medium, and small enterprises, with a focus on medium and small factories, is implemented to accelerate the speed of construction.

A number of China's original chemical factories and research institutions have begun to pay attention to trial production of organic synthesis products in the past two years. New products such as polyvinyl chloride, perchloroethylene, polyethylene, synthetic fibers, and plexiglass have been successfully trial-produced in various regions. Since the emphasis on the development of synthetic fibers last year, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shenyang, Beijing and other places have also made rapid progress in the trial production of nylon 66, nylon 11, polyacrylonitrile and the research of silk drawing technology, and made small amount of samples. As a key development in the future, polyvinyl chloride has relatively mature experience in technology. Other production technologies such as caprolon, amino plastics, and chloroprene rubber can also be mastered quickly. China is also rich in coal, calcium carbide, salt, natural gas, petroleum gas, and some agricultural products as raw materials for the organic synthesis industry. As long as a part of the coal mined across the country this year is comprehensively utilized, it will be enough to establish dozens of chemical raw material bases across the country. Using hydropower during the flood season to produce calcium carbide can also provide the organic synthesis industry with a large amount of cheap raw materials. These two raw materials and salt will become the main raw materials for China's organic synthesis industry.

At present, a series of tasks such as capital construction, research and design for the development of the organic synthesis industry are being stepped up. The Jinxi Chemical Plant, invested by the central government, is expanding its polyvinyl chloride workshop and plexiglass workshop. The newly built caprolon intermediate experimental workshop of this plant was put into production on April 26, producing caprolon monomer for the first time on Chinese soil. The Lanzhou Chemical Plant, newly built by the central government, and the polyvinyl chloride and chloroprene rubber projects built in Beijing, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Sichuan, Tianjin, Guangdong and other places have all started construction, most of which can be completed and put into production this year. The Jilin Calcium Carbide Plant, built last year, will also start the second phase of construction from the second half of this year. After the expansion, the output of calcium carbide will be three times higher than at present, and it will also produce polyvinyl chloride, chloroprene rubber, polyacrylonitrile and other products. Other provinces and cities such as Jiangsu, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Anhui, and Fujian are also preparing to start building factories to produce polyvinyl chloride, caprolon, amino plastics, and to use agricultural and sideline products to produce furfural plastics this year.

The Design Institute of the Ministry of Chemical Industry will design seventy-seven drawings for the development of the organic synthesis industry this year. The finalized designs of polyvinyl chloride plants with an annual output of 500 tons, 1,500 tons, and 6,000 tons, calcium carbide workshops with an annual output of 750 tons, 1,100 tons, and 20,000 tons, and furfural plants with an annual output of 100 tons have all been completed ahead of schedule. The design of caprolon plants with an annual output of 1,000 tons and six other designs can also be released before the end of June. Researchers have also changed their past attitude of conducting research behind closed doors without regard for production, and will focus on helping factories master the production technology of caprolon and chloroprene rubber this year, and will continue to research and improve the production technology of polyvinyl chloride.

In order to solve the urgent need for technical forces in the current plant construction and production, the Ministry of Chemical Industry has sent a group of technicians to the Soviet Union, East Germany and Romania to study. The existing organic synthesis industrial base, Jinxi Chemical Plant, has also begun to train technical cadres and technical workers for fourteen provinces and cities. The Ministry of Chemical Industry and some provinces and cities will also hold some short-term training courses. (Attached picture)

This factory uses hydrogen chloride and calcium carbide as raw materials and produces 500 tons of polyvinyl chloride annually. The investment is about 160,000 to 170,000 yuan, which is suitable for special zones to build.

    加速发展有机合成化学工业
    据新华社28日讯　有机合成化学工业今后将成为我国整个工业发展的一个重点。目前化学工业部正采取一系列措施，使我国工业中的这一空白点在第二个五年计划期间打下可靠的基础，争取在十年内赶上英国生产水平。
    加速建立和发展这一新的工业部门，将大大促进我国工农业生产的发展和有助于人民生活水平的提高。
    化工部根据中共中央的指示，最近反复研究了有机合成工业的发展方针，修订了原来的保守规划，将1962年的塑料、合成橡胶、合成纤维、合成洗涤剂等主要的有机合成化学产品的产量指标提高了二倍到四倍。为了使第一个五年计划期间没有给以应有发展的有机合成化学工业急起直追、迎头赶上，化工部采取的方针是首先大量发展聚氯乙烯、氨基塑料、卡普隆和氯丁橡胶等几个主要品种。这些品种目前都为工农业生产和人民生活迫切需要，大部分制成品价格低廉，适合广大人民消费水平。并且贯彻大中小相结合、以中小厂为主的建设方针，加快建设的速度。
    我国原有的一批化工厂和研究机构近两年来已经开始注意试制有机合成产品。聚氯乙烯、过氯乙烯、聚乙烯、合成纤维、有机玻璃等新产品在各地都已试制成功。自去年强调发展合成纤维以后，上海、江苏、沈阳、北京等地在尼龙66、尼龙11、聚丙烯腈的试制和抽丝技术的研究工作上也很快取得了成绩，作出了小量样品。作为今后重点发展的聚氯乙烯，在技术上已经有了比较成熟的经验。其他如卡普隆、氨基塑料、氯丁橡胶的生产技术也可以很快掌握。作为有机合成工业原料的煤、电石、食盐、天然气、石油气和部分农产品，我国也很丰富。只要将今年全国开采的煤综合利用一部分，就足以在全国建立几十个化工原料基地。利用洪水季节的水力发电制造电石，也可以使有机合成工业得到大量廉价的原料。这两种原料和食盐将成为我国有机合成工业的主要原料。
    现在，发展有机合成工业的基本建设、研究设计等一系列工作都在加紧进行。由中央投资的锦西化工厂正在扩建聚氯乙烯车间、有机玻璃车间，这个工厂新建的卡普隆中间实验车间，已经在4月26日投入生产，在我国的土地上，第一次生产出卡普隆单体。中央投资新建的兰州化工厂，和在北京、上海、浙江、四川、天津、广东等地兴建的聚氯乙烯、氯丁橡胶工程都已动工，其中大部分可以在今年建成投入生产。去年建成的吉林电石厂从今年下半年起也将开始建设第二期工程，扩建后电石产量将比目前增加三倍，并将生产聚氯乙烯、氯丁橡胶、聚丙烯腈等产品。其他如江苏、贵州、江西、内蒙古、安徽、福建等许多省市也都准备在今年内开始建设生产聚氯乙烯、卡普隆、氨基塑料的工厂，以及利用农副产品生产?酫塑料。
    化工部设计院今年将为发展有机合成工业，设计七十七项图纸，现在年产五百吨、一千五百吨、六千吨的聚氯乙烯厂，年产七百五十吨、一千一百吨、二万吨的电石车间，年产一百吨的?酫厂等九项定型设计都已提前完成，年产一千吨的卡普隆厂等六项设计在6月底以前也可以出图。研究人员也改变了过去闭门研究不问生产的态度，要在今年内着重帮助工厂掌握卡普隆、氯丁橡胶的生产技术，对聚氯乙烯的生产技术也将继续研究改进。
    为了解决当前建厂和生产中对技术力量的迫切需要，化工部已派出一批技术人员到苏联、民主德国和罗马尼亚学习，现有的有机合成工业基地——锦西化工厂，也已开始为十四个省市培训技术干部和技术工人。化工部和有些省市还将举办一些短期训练班。（附图片）
