Xinhua News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch: A retired senior US tax official wrote that American "income tax and inflation equal robbery."

T. Coleman Andrews, who once served as the U.S. government's Commissioner of Internal Revenue and Chief Tax Collector, published an article in the April issue of "American Mercury" magazine, criticizing the U.S. government's policy of plundering the people.

Andrews pointed out that in less than two years, the cost of living for the American people has increased by $36 billion due to high taxes and inflation. He said, "This is practically equivalent to doubling our personal income tax."

Andrews pointed out that a single person earning $2,000 a year paid only $25 in income tax in 1939, but currently has to pay $240, an increase of almost tenfold. Moreover, due to inflation, the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased by half, and the remaining $1,760 has the purchasing power of only $869 in 1939. For the same reason, an income of $3,000 today is only worth $1,273 un-devalued dollars after tax, while in 1939, $2,943 could be left after tax. Today, an income of at least $4,772 is needed to match the purchasing power of $2,000 income after tax in 1939.

Andrews said, "More than half of your income has flowed into the sewers of high taxes and inflation." He also pointed out that "most occupations offer salaries that cannot keep up with the rising cost of living," and "the lower the income level, the worse the situation." Office workers, technicians, freelancers, and craftsmen "cannot get sufficient remuneration for their time and talent," and those who live on pensions and other fixed incomes are in a "tragic situation."

    美国政府绞榨人民血汗
    所得税和通货膨胀等于抢劫
    一个退职的高级税务官揭露
    新华社3日讯　纽约消息：一个退职了的美国高级税务官员写道，美国的“所得税和通货膨胀等于抢劫”。
    曾经当过美国政府国内税专员和首席收税官的特·柯尔曼·安德鲁斯在4月份的“美国信使”杂志发表文章指责美国政府对人民的掠夺政策。
    安德鲁斯指出，在不到两年的时间内，美国人民的生活费用由于赋税很高和通货膨胀而增加三百六十亿美元。他说，“这实际上就等于我们的个人所得税增加了一倍”。
    安德鲁斯指出，一个每年挣两千美元的单身汉在1939年时只缴所得税二十五美元，而目前要缴二百四十美元，税款几乎增加到十倍，而且由于通货膨胀，美元的购买力已减少了一半，他剩下的一千七百六十美元的购买力只抵到1939年时的八百六十九元。由于同样的理由，今天三千美元的收入纳税以后只值一千二百七十三块未贬值的美元，而1939年时纳税后却可剩下二千九百四十三美元。今天至少要有四千七百七十二美元的收入，才能抵到1939年二千美元收入付税后的购买力。
    安德鲁斯说，“你的收入有一半以上已经流入高额的赋税和通货膨胀的下水道里去了”。他还指出，“大多数职业所提供的薪水都跟不上生活费用的上升”，“收入水平愈低，情况也愈恶劣”，办公室工作者、技术人员、自由职业者和手工业者“无法使他们的时间和才能获得充分的报酬”，那些靠养老金和其他固定收入生活的人的“情况是悲惨的”。
