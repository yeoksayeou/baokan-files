　　Every Household Leaps Forward, Every Plot Leaps Forward
    Five Thousand Individual Farmers in Minhou Join the Commune

    (Our Dispatch) Amidst the high tide of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production, more than five thousand individual farming households in Minhou County, Fujian Province, enthusiastically joined agricultural cooperatives during the mass rectification campaign of "Double Opposition and Double Comparison."

    Minhou County had over five thousand individual farming households, accounting for about 5% of the county's total farming households, cultivating land that constituted approximately 7% of the county's total cultivated area. Last winter and this spring, cooperatives in various regions were vigorously engaged in water conservancy projects, road construction, increased fertilizer accumulation, and the acquisition of agricultural machinery for technological innovation. These individual farmers, working alone, were unable to participate in these efforts. Furthermore, their land was often interspersed among the cooperative's fields, affecting the cooperative's land planning and other technological reforms. Meanwhile, through two years of factual education and socialist debates, these farmers had raised their political consciousness and were eager to join the cooperative, participate in the Great Leap Forward, and jointly build a new socialist countryside. The Minhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believed that absorbing these individual farmers into the cooperatives was a favorable opportunity to resolve the legacy issues of the agricultural cooperativization stage and to organize everyone in the countryside into the high tide of the Great Leap Forward. Moreover, it would benefit the realization of a Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the consolidation of agricultural cooperatives. Simply by incorporating the individual farmers' land, which accounts for about 7% of the county's cultivated area, into the cooperatives and bringing it up to the cultivation level of the cooperatives' existing land, the county's total grain output could be increased by about 10%. This would achieve a Great Leap Forward for every household and every plot of land. Therefore, combined with the "Double Opposition and Double Comparison" campaign, a major debate was launched on "whether or not to absorb individual farmers into the cooperatives and jointly engage in the mass Great Leap Forward," further enhancing the collectivist thinking of advanced members helping the backward among cooperative cadres and members. It corrected the "closed-door" mentality of some agricultural cooperative cadres and members who were unwilling to absorb or actively accept individual farmers into the cooperatives, so that agricultural cooperatives throughout the county successively accepted and welcomed individual farmers to join. As of early May, the vast majority of the county's more than five thousand individual farming households had been accepted into agricultural cooperatives, and more than three thousand two hundred members of more than one hundred and seventy primary cooperatives had also either converted to advanced cooperatives or joined nearby advanced cooperatives. Now, the veteran members of the various cooperatives are actively leading these new members to participate in the cooperative's various production, construction, and learning of advanced production technologies. In accordance with the cooperative's Great Leap Forward production plan, they are carrying out unified planning, adjustment, and intensive cultivation of the more than fifty thousand mu of newly incorporated land, transforming all the low-yielding land that individual farmers were previously unable to manage into high-yielding land, and striving to increase grain production by more than 20 million jin this year compared to the original plan, truly achieving a Great Leap Forward for every household and every plot of land.

### 户户大跃进  块块大跃进  闽侯五千个体农户入社

　　户户大跃进  块块大跃进
    闽侯五千个体农户入社
    本报讯　在农业生产大跃进的高潮中，福建省闽侯县五千多户个体农民在双反双比的全民整风运动中，绝大部分都踊跃加入了农业社。
    闽侯县的个体农民有五千多户约占全县总农户5％，耕种的土地约占全县耕地面积7％左右。去冬今春，各地合作社都在大搞水利、修筑道路、增积肥料、购置耕作机械等技术革新运动，这些个体农民一家一户都无法进行，他们的土地又多分布在合作社的田园中间，影响合作社的土地规划和其他技术改革。同时这些农民经过两年来的事实教育和社会主义大辩论，提高了政治觉悟，纷纷要求入社，参加大跃进的行列，共同建设社会主义新农村。中共闽侯县委认为吸收这些个体农民加入合作社，是解决农业合作化阶段的遗留问题和把农村中所有人都组织进大跃进高潮的有利时机，而且对实现农业生产大跃进和巩固农业社也有好处，仅把占全县耕地面积7％左右的个体农民土地入社，赶上合作社原有土地的耕作水平，就可使全县粮食总产量多增产一成左右。做到户户大跃进，块块土地大跃进。因此，便结合双反双比运动，开展了“要不要吸收个体农民入社，共同投入全民大跃进”的大辩论，进一步提高了各个合作社干部和社员的先进帮助落后的集体主义思想，纠正了部分农业社干部、社员不愿吸收和不积极接纳个体农民入社的“关门”想法，使全县农业社都纷纷接纳和欢迎个体农民入社。到5月上旬止，全县五千多户个体农民绝大部分都已被接纳入农业社，一百七十多个初级社的三千二百多户社员也分别转办高级社或参加附近高级社。现在各合作社的老社员们，正积极带领这些新社员参加社里各项生产、建设、学习先进生产技术，按照社里大跃进的生产规划要求，对新入社的五万多亩田进行统一规划、调整和实行细作，把原来因个体农民无力加工的低产田全部改变成高产田，争取今年比原订计划多增产粮食二千多万斤，真正做到了户户大跃进，块块土地大跃进。（刘葵华）
