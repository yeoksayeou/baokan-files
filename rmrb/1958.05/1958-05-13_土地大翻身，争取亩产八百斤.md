　　A Great Turnaround for the Land: Striving for 800 Jin Per Mu
　　Lü Bingguang, First Secretary of the CPC Changge County Committee, Henan Province

    The 500,000 people of Changge County, Henan Province, based on the nationwide rectification movement last winter and this spring, are filled with the spirit of selfless labor. On the 1,120,000 mu of cultivated land, they have achieved water conservancy and accumulated 30 billion jin of fertilizer (currently averaging 28,000 jin of fertilizer per mu). At the same time, a large-scale deep plowing land movement has been launched. As of the end of April, 330,000 mu of early autumn land have been deep plowed once, with a depth of about 1.5 chi. We plan to give all 1,120,000 mu of cultivated land in the county a major turnaround this year, striving for a yield of 800 jin per mu.

    The facts of the past three years have fully proven that deep plowing of land is an important measure for increasing agricultural production. Only deep plowing of land can fully utilize the yield-increasing effects of water conservancy and fertilizer. For example, in Victory Team No. 1 of Houhe Township, the 7.9 mu of land deep plowed in 1954 yielded an average of 810 jin per mu; the 2 mu deep plowed in 1956 yielded 1,146 jin per mu; and the 1 mu deep plowed in 1957 yielded 1,319 jin. The Youth Experimental Farm in Pohu Township, using the ditch plowing and strip planting method in 1957, achieved an average yield of 1,000 jin of corn per mu on 67 mu. Not only can deep plowing increase corn production, but other crops can also increase production. For example, the millet yield on plowed land in Team No. 13 of Chengguan Township was 600 jin per mu, while the unplowed land only yielded 320 jin. The sweet potato yield on plowed land (late crop) in Team No. 3 of Duncun Temple Township was 8,000 jin per mu, while the unplowed land yielded 1,500 jin. The wheat yield on plowed land in Team No. 3 of Pohu Township was 450 jin per mu, while the unplowed land yielded 250 jin. The cotton yield on plowed land in Team No. 18 of Shiqiaolu Township was 320 jin of seed cotton per mu, while the unplowed land yielded 30 jin; the tobacco yield on plowed land was 600 jin per mu, while the unplowed land yielded 250 jin. The peanut yield on plowed land in Team No. 6 of Shuangmiaoli Township was 350 jin per mu, while the unplowed land yielded 180 jin. Many examples prove that as long as the land is deep plowed, it can increase production by tens of percent, even one or several times. The masses reflect: "Deep plowing by an inch is as good as a layer of manure," "Water is blood, fertilizer is grain, deep plowing builds granaries."

    How did our county launch a mass deep plowing land movement last winter and this spring, in conjunction with water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation?

    Deep plowing has ten major benefits.
    Fully mobilize the masses, organize widespread visits, conduct on-the-spot debates, and provide on-the-spot practice.

    Deep plowing of land to improve the soil is certainly a good thing, but it is not without its challenges. The large-scale deep plowing land movement was launched amidst the struggle between advanced and conservative ideas. When the county party committee proposed the requirement to deep plow the early autumn land once this year, most cadres and the masses had the idea that "it is good, but can't be done," fearing the labor, the trouble, the impact on water conservancy, and the fear that the increase in labor would not lead to a significant increase in production; technicians insisted on the gradual deepening of the land. In order to solve these ideological problems, the county party committee first organized the township party committee secretaries and team branch secretaries to visit Victory Team No. 1 of Houhe Township. By calculating the increase in production, they boosted their enthusiasm; by practicing, they learned the methods of plowing; and by debating, they unified their understanding. They summarized the ten major benefits of deep plowing in increasing production: (1) It can weather the soil, turning dead soil into living soil, and living soil into fertile soil, deepening the fertile layer of the soil and enhancing the soil's aggregate structure; (2) The loose soil layer is deepened, facilitating root development; (3) It can enhance water storage capacity, preserving moisture and preventing drought; (4) It can dissolve and fully utilize the effectiveness of fertilizers; (5) It reduces surface runoff, preventing waterlogging; (6) The land becomes ridged, facilitating irrigation; (7) It can eradicate weeds; (8) It can eliminate pests; (9) The soil is loose and easy to level; (10) It enables crops to take root deeply, enhancing wind resistance.

    Subsequently, the county party committee universally organized the masses to visit and launched mass debates to raise awareness, boost confidence, and strengthen determination. For example, Victory Team No. 1 of Houhe Township seized the fact that plowing increased production, organized veteran farmers and technicians to study in Team No. 7, and debated on the spot what benefits deep plowing has and whether it can actually increase production. The veteran farmers said, "Plowing naturally requires effort, but the effort will not be in vain. As long as the land can be plowed well, increasing production is 'like catching fish in a jar, guaranteed'." Guo Hexi, a middle peasant team member in his fifties, who was originally firmly opposed to plowing, admitted after visiting and debating that "crops will not grow strong without plowing." This cleared up his thinking and set off a plowing craze. The team completed the deep plowing of 756 mu of early autumn land in ten days. The team members said, "Plowing is like plowing gold. The old soil of a thousand years is turned over, and this year we will achieve double thousand jin, striving to report good news to Tiananmen."

    Improve tools and increase plowing efficiency.
    Deep plowing is good, but can a major turnaround be done in a year, or not?

    After the broad masses recognized the benefits of deep plowing, the plowing movement became widespread. At the beginning, it was entirely done manually, one shovel at a time. Each person could only plow 1.5 to 2 fen of land per day. Although the quality was good, it took too much labor. What to do when the production tasks are large and the labor force is insufficient? In order to solve this problem, the broad masses used their brains, thought of ways, offered suggestions, and asked for advice everywhere, resulting in a high tide of agricultural tool reform. In this movement, not only were various tools for water lifting, transportation, fertilizer accumulation, and processing of agricultural and sideline products invented, but also tools for deep plowing of land were developed. Heshanqiao first created a method of combining human and animal power for plowing, increasing efficiency by more than double. Immediately afterwards, Wang Shuiwang of Zengfumiao Township created a double-layered double-moldboard plow. Two animals and one person could operate it and plow three mu of land per day, with a depth of 1.5 chi. In addition, various plows for deep plowing of land were created. This solved the difficulty of high labor consumption and insufficient labor force, ensuring that the task of deep plowing 1,120,000 mu of land would be completed this year.

    Several methods of deep plowing
    Deep plowing should generally adopt different methods according to different soil types, times, crops, and labor conditions:

    1. Manual universal plowing, side plowing and side mixing of fertilizer. This method first plows the topsoil (about six or seven inches deep) to one side, then applies the fertilizer to the subsoil, and then uses an iron shovel to turn over the second layer of subsoil, mix it with fertilizer, break up the clods, and still put it in the lower layer without moving it. Plow the second row next to it, turning the topsoil of the second row on top of the subsoil of the first row, and so on. The depth is about 1.5 chi.

    2. Manual ditch plowing, some plowing two layers, some plowing three layers. The method is to first use a rope to divide into grids about two chi wide according to the row spacing of the crops to be planted, and plow a ditch one chi wide in each grid. When plowing the ditch in the first grid, first dig out the topsoil and place it on the back ridge, then dig out the second layer of subsoil and place it on another back ridge, then apply fertilizer into the ditch, and then use an iron shovel (or iron fork) to deep plow the third layer, break up the clods and mix them evenly with the fertilizer in place. After that, mix the second layer of subsoil with fertilizer and put it into the ditch. Then plow the ditch of the second grid, and turn the topsoil dug out from the second grid into the ditch of the first grid, and the first grid is considered complete. Dig backwards grid by grid and ditch by ditch. The method of plowing two layers is the same as this, and the crops are planted in the plowed ditch. The advantage of this method is that the fertility is concentrated, and it is also relatively labor-saving.

    3. Combination of human and animal power for plowing. This method is more efficient than plowing with human power alone, and it is divided into two types: one is that people plow the upper layer, and the plow plows the lower layer. People first use iron shovels to turn the topsoil to one side, and then use animals to deeply plow the subsoil, and then plow the second row next to it, turning the topsoil of the second row onto the plowed ground of the first row, and plow down in order, with a depth of about 1.5 chi. The other is front plowing and back hoeing, that is, the front is plowed with animals, and the back is hoeed by people. This method is generally used when there is insufficient animal power.

    4. All animal power plowing. There are also two ways to do this: one is front plowing and back setting, front using an eight-inch walking plow for deep plowing, and the back using a plow chain with the plow face removed. This method is highly effective and saves labor, but the quality is not as high as that of iron shovel plowing. The other is to use a double-layered double-moldboard plow to plow, and the depth also reaches about 1.5 chi. This method is the fastest.

    The above-mentioned several plowing methods are suitable for general soil in plain areas, and the plowing methods for sandy wasteland are different from this. For land with a thin layer of sand, deep plowing can be done manually, turning the good soil below up and pressing the coarse sand down. In the past, the masses in Han Zuo Township described this place as: "The wind blows up yellow sand, you can't see the traces when walking, two ridges and one depression, you have to be afraid of drought and flood, you work hard for a whole year, and finally you don't get anything." After the land that was not suitable for crops in the past was plowed, the highest yield of corn was 700 jin per mu, and the yield of peanuts was more than 300 jin per mu. For places with particularly thick layers of sand, the method of changing soil is adopted, bringing soil or pit mud from other places to cover the sandy soil, turning the sandy wasteland into fertile land.

    Problems to be aware of
    Several issues must also be paid attention to when plowing: (1) Soil quality should be differentiated. For example, black clay soil is tight and the soil clumps are large. After plowing, the soil layer is too loose. Therefore, it is best to plow this type of soil in winter. After snow soaking and weathering, the soil layer can be compacted. If it is plowed after the Spring Festival, it must be watered once after plowing. Yellow sandy soil is loose and loose, and it will break after plowing. This type of soil can be harrowed after plowing. The depth of plowing should not be forcibly uniform. The thick soil layer can be deeply plowed, and the thin soil layer can be shallowly plowed. (2) Time should be differentiated. Winter fallow land can generally be plowed before freezing (turning the subsoil below on top and the topsoil above down), because the time from sowing is long, and the subsoil can be fertilized after winter weathering. In spring, it should be lightly plowed (the topsoil should still be placed on top) to avoid the subsoil from weathering, resulting in a decrease in production in the current season. (3) Crops should be differentiated. Wide ridge and large leaf crops (such as corn, tobacco, cotton, etc.) are suitable for ditch plowing. Narrow row and small leaf crops and root crops (such as potatoes) are suitable for universal plowing. (4) Plowing subsoil must be combined with fertilization. Fertilizer can heat and loosen the subsoil. Generally, it is best to apply a mixture of pig, sheep, and human manure.

　　土地大翻身，争取亩产八百斤
　　中共河南省长葛县委第一书记　吕炳光
    河南省长葛县五十万人民，去冬今春在全民整风运动的基础上，充满着忘我劳动的精神，在一百一十二万亩的耕地上，已实现了水利化，积肥三百亿斤（目前平均每亩肥料二万八千斤）。与此同时，开展了大规模的深翻土地运动，截止四月底，全县三十三万亩早秋地已深翻了一遍，深度都在一尺五左右。我们计划今年把全县一百一十二万亩耕地来一个大翻身，争取亩产八百斤。
    三年来的事实完全证明了深翻土地是农业增产的一项重要措施，深翻土地才更能充分地发挥水利和肥料的增产效能。如后河乡胜利一社，1954年深翻的七亩九分地，平均亩产八百一十斤；1956年深翻的二亩，亩产一千一百四十六斤；1957年深翻的一亩产量达一千三百一十九斤。坡胡乡青年试验场，1957年采用沟翻条播的方法，六十七亩玉米平均亩产一千斤。深翻地不仅玉米可以增产，其他作物同样可以增产。如城关乡十三社翻地的谷子亩产六百斤，未翻的只三百二十斤。杜村寺乡三社翻地的红薯亩产八千斤（晚茬），未翻的一千五百斤。坡胡乡三社翻地的小麦亩产四百五十斤，未翻的二百五十斤。石桥路乡十八社翻地的棉花亩产籽棉三百二十斤，未翻的三十斤；翻地的烟叶亩产六百斤，未翻的二百五十斤。双庙李乡六社翻地的花生亩产三百五十斤，未翻的一百八十斤。很多实例证明，土地只要经过深翻，即可增产百分之几十以至一倍、几倍。群众反映：“深犁加一寸，顶上一遍粪”，“水是血，粪是粮，深翻土地建谷仓”。
    我县在去冬今春如何结合水利积肥运动，开展了群众性的深翻土地运动呢？
    深翻地有十大好处
    全面发动群众，普遍组织参观，就地辩论，就地实习。
    深翻土地，改良土壤，虽然是一件好事情，但也不是一帆风顺的。大规模的深翻土地运动，是在先进思想和保守思想斗争中开展起来的。当县委提出今年把早秋地深翻一遍的要求时，在大部分干群中存在着“好是好，翻不了”的思想，怕费工，怕麻烦，怕影响水利化，怕费工多增产少；技术人员则坚持土地逐渐加深的规律。为了解决这些思想问题，县委首先组织乡党委书记和社支部书记参观了后河乡胜利一社，通过算增产账，鼓足了干劲，通过实习学会了翻地办法，通过辩论统一了认识，总结出深翻地能以增加生产的十大好处，（1）可以风化土壤，使死土变活土，活土变油土，加深了土壤的肥沃层，增强了土壤的团粒结构；（2）松土层加深，便于根系发育；（3）能增强蓄水能力，保墒防旱；（4）能溶化和充分发挥肥料的效能；（5）减少地面径流，防止内涝；（6）土地成畦，便于灌溉；（7）能根除杂草；（8）可以消灭虫害；（9）土壤松虚，便于平整；（10）能使作物扎根深，增强抗风能力。
    随后县委又普遍组织群众参观，开展群众性的辩论，以提高认识，鼓舞信心与决心。如后河乡胜利一社，就是抓住了翻地增产的事实，组织老农、技术员到七队学习，就地辩论了深翻地有什么好处？到底能不能增产？老农说“翻地自然要费力气，可是力气不会白下，只要能把地翻好，增产是“罐里摸鱼，没跑”。五十多岁的中农社员郭合喜，原来是坚决反对翻地的，经过参观辩论后，承认了“不翻地庄稼不会长的壮”。从而打通了思想，掀起了翻地热潮，该社十天时间完成了七百五十六亩早秋地的深翻任务。社员们说“翻地如翻金，千年老土翻了身，今年实现双千斤，争取报喜天安门”。
    改进工具  提高翻地效率
    深翻地好是好，一年来个大翻身，翻了翻不了呢？
    当着广大群众认识了深翻土地的好处以后，翻地运动就普遍开展起来了。开始时完全是用人工一锨一锨的翻，每人每天只能翻地一分半到二分，虽然质量好，但是费工太多。生产任务大劳动力不足怎么办？广大群众为了解决这个问题，人人动脑筋，个个想办法，献计献策，到处请诸葛，出现了农具改革运动的高潮。在这个运动中，不仅创造发明了各种提水、运输、积肥和农副业产品加工等工具，而且也解决了深翻土地的工具。和尚桥首先创造人力畜力结合翻地的方法，效率提高了一倍以上。紧接着增福庙乡王水旺创造了一种双层双铧犁，两头牲口，一人操作每天可翻地三亩，深度一尺五寸。此外，还创造了各种深翻土地的犁。这样就解决了用工多劳力少的困难，就能够保证在今年完成深翻土地一百一十二万亩的任务。
    几种深翻地的方法
    深翻土地一般应根据土质、时间、作物、劳力等不同条件采用不同的办法：
    1、人工普遍翻，边翻边掺肥料。这种办法是先把表层熟土（约六、七寸深）翻到一边，然后把肥料施到生土上，再用铁锨把二层生土翻开，与肥料搅拌打碎坷垃后，仍放在下层不动，挨着翻第二行，把第二行熟土翻在第一行生土上面，这样依次翻下去。深度一尺半左右。
    2、人工沟翻，有的翻两层，有的翻三层。方法是根据所种作物的行距，先用绳划成二尺左右宽的格子，每一格内翻一尺来宽的沟。在翻第一格的沟时，先把表层熟土挖出，放在背垅上，接着再把二层生土挖出，放在另一背垅上，然后把肥料施入沟内，再用铁锨（或铁钗）深翻第三层，打碎坷垃与肥料掺匀放在原处，此后，就把第二层生土拌好肥料放到沟内，接着翻第二格的沟，把第二格挖出的表层熟土翻入第一格沟里，第一格即算完成。这样逐格逐沟向后挖。翻两层的方法与此相同，作物就种到翻过的沟里面。这种办法的好处是肥力集中，也比较省工。
    3、人畜力结合翻。这种方法比光用人力翻效率高，其中分为两种：一种是人翻上层，犁翻下层。人工先用铁锨把表层熟土翻到一边，再用牲口将生土深犁一遍，挨着翻第二行，把第二行熟土翻到第一行犁过的地面上，顺序下翻，深度约一尺半。另一种是前犁后刨，即前面用牲口犁，后面用人工刨。这种办法，一般是畜力不足的情况下采用的。
    4、全用畜力翻。这也有两种办法：一种是前犁后套，前用八吋步犁深犁，后用去掉犁面的犁串。这种方法效力高，省工，但不如铁锨翻的质量高。再一种是用双层双铧犁翻，深度也达一尺半左右，以这种办法为最快。
    上述几种翻地方法，适用于平原地区的一般土壤，至于沙荒地的翻法则与此不同。对于沙层较薄的土地，可用人工深翻，将下面的好土翻上来，粗沙压下去。韩左乡过去群众形容这里是：“大风黄沙起，走路不见迹，两岗加一凹，旱涝都得怕，劳动一年整，最后不收啥。”过去不成庄稼的地经翻后，玉米最高的有亩产七百斤的，花生有亩产三百多斤的。对于沙层特别厚的地方，采取换土的方法，把别处的土或坑泥拉来覆盖在沙土上，使沙荒变成良田。
    应注意的问题
    在翻地中还必须注意几个问题：（1）要分土质。如黑粘土性紧，土块大，翻后土层太虚，因此，这种土冬翻最好，经过雪浸，风化，土层即可塌实。如果春节后翻，翻后要浇一次水。黄沙土土性疏松，翻过即碎，这种土翻后耙过即可。翻的深度也不能强求一律，土层厚可深翻，土层薄可浅翻。（2）要分时间。冬季休闲地一般是上冻前可以大翻（把下面的生土翻在上面，上边的熟土翻下去），因为距离播种时间较长，生土经过冬季风化，可以增强肥力。入春后要小翻（表层土仍放在上面），以免生土不风化，造成当季减产。（3）分作物，宽垅大叶作物（如玉米、烟叶、棉花等）适于沟翻。窄行小叶作物和根生作物（如薯类），以普遍翻的方法为适宜。（4）翻生土必须结合施肥，肥料可使生土发热发虚，一般以猪、羊、人粪混合施为好。
