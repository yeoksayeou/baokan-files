Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Flora of China, originally expected to take decades to complete, is now projected to be finished in ten years and will begin publication next National Day. This is a result of the great leap forward in thinking by Chinese plant taxonomy workers.

Compiling a national flora is a very arduous task. American plant taxonomy has nearly two hundred years of history, but they still haven't written a complete Flora of the United States. Japan has more than eighty years of plant research history, but they still don't have a full set of flora. China has a large number of plant species, with about 30,000 known higher plants, surpassing other countries and making it one of the most plant-rich regions in the world. On the other hand, although this discipline has a relatively strong foundation in China, it only has forty years of history, and there are very few talents in plant taxonomy. Therefore, China's work on compiling flora is more difficult than in other countries. Many Chinese plant taxonomists originally planned to complete the preparatory work in twelve years, start writing during the fourth five-year plan, and complete it in several decades, feeling that this speed was not too slow.

The complete Flora of China will have more than 20 million words and about 3,000 illustrations, divided into sixty or seventy volumes or more according to plant families. The first batch of seven volumes will be published next National Day: Volume 1 of Pteridophytes, Betulaceae, Juglandaceae and Myricaceae, Trochodendraceae, Lamiaceae, Cyperaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Verbenaceae, and Dioscoreaceae, compiled by the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Nanjing Zhongshan Botanical Garden of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, respectively.

The Flora of China will tell us which plants exist in China and the following aspects of each plant: its scientific name (Latin) and Chinese name, which family and genus it belongs to, whether the species is correctly identified, and records about it in various countries' literature; its external morphological characteristics, its place of origin in China, and the environment and natural conditions in which it grows; its distribution in China and around the world; and the economic uses of plants with economic value. To complete these tasks, a large amount of field investigation and detailed indoor research work is required.

Knowing the content of the flora allows us to understand its significant role in production and construction and science itself: it is an important basis for developing the economy, especially agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, in expanding the utilization of plant resources; it is basic data for agricultural, forestry, and pastoral zoning, natural zoning, economic zoning, geobotany, plant resource science, plant morphology, plant anatomy, and breeding work. Without the Flora of China, it would be difficult for Chinese plant taxonomy to catch up with the world's advanced level. With the Flora of China, it will be easier to compile plant taxonomy textbooks for universities. Currently, there are no taxonomy textbooks in Chinese universities based on Chinese plants.

Compiling a national flora requires collectivist spirit and the cooperation of a large number of people to carry out comprehensive plant surveys and research work. This is also a work that people with bourgeois individualism are not very interested in because it takes a long time and a lot of energy. Before liberation, Chinese plant taxonomists often talked about this, but it was just talk. After liberation, many taxonomists still believed that the conditions for compiling a flora in China were not yet ripe. In this rectification movement, plant taxonomy workers at the Institute of Botany criticized individualistic thinking. At the same time, driven by the great leap forward in various works across the country, everyone felt that such an important work as the Flora of China could surely be a leap forward. So they began bottoming out to see if there were conditions for immediately starting the compilation work. After their ideological leap forward, they believed that the conditions existed, and the difficulties could be overcome. The large amount of survey and research work carried out in the eight years since liberation had accumulated a certain amount of data. Some ancient specimens and related books were promised to be assisted by relevant Soviet parties as much as possible. Young people could be trained through the work of compiling the flora, and the scientific team could also grow rapidly. After careful calculation, everyone believed that as long as they showed revolutionary vigor, they could completely complete this huge task in ten years by starting to compile, continuing to investigate, and training cadres simultaneously, all three advancing together. After the Institute of Botany put forward this initiative, it was immediately warmly responded to by plant taxonomy workers in relevant research units such as the Institute of Forestry and Soil Science, the Nanjing Zhongshan Botanical Garden, and the South China Botanical Garden.

### 中国植物分类学工作者大丰收　几十年的事十年办到　中国植物志明年国庆节开始出版

　　中国植物分类学工作者大丰收
　　几十年的事十年办到
　　中国植物志明年国庆节开始出版
    新华社10日讯　原想几十年才能完成的中国植物志，预计可以提前在十年内完成，明年国庆节将开始出版。这是中国植物分类学工作者思想大跃进以后的丰收。
    编写一部全国的植物志是一件很繁重的工作。美国的植物分类学已有近二百年的历史，可是直到现在还没有写出全美植物志；日本的植物分类研究已有八十年以上的历史，现在也还没有全套植物志。我国植物种类繁多，现在已经知道的，高等植物就约有三万种，胜过其他各国，是世界上植物种类最丰富的地区之一；另一方面，这门学科在我国虽是较有基础的学科，但也只有四十年的历史；植物分类学方面的人材也很少，因此我国编著植物志的工作较其他国家更为艰难。不少中国植物分类学家原先计划在十二年内完成准备工作，第四个五年计划期间开始编写，在几十年内完成，觉得这个速度也不算慢。
    中国植物志全部完成，共有二千万字以上，插图约有三千多幅，按植物科目分六七十册或更多，明年国庆节首批出版七册：蕨类植物第一册、桦木科、核桃科和杨梅科、马尾树科、唇形科、莎草科、玄参科、马鞭草科、薯蓣科，分别由中国科学院植物研究所和中国科学院植物研究所南京中山植物园编写。
    中国植物志可以使我们知道中国有那些植物以及每一种植物的下列各方面情况：它的学名（拉丁文）和中文名称、是那一科那一属、种是否定得正确、各国文献中关于它的记载；它的外部形态特征、它在中国的产地、它在什么环境和自然条件下生长；它在中国境内和全世界的分布情况；有经济价值的植物的经济用途。要完成这些工作，就要进行大量的野外调查和室内的细致研究工作。
    知道了植物志的内容以后，就可以知道它对于生产建设和科学本身的重大作用：它是开发经济、特别是农林牧事业在扩大利用植物资源方面的一个重要依据；它是农林牧区划、自然区划、经济区划、地植物学、植物资源学、植物形态学、植物解剖学和育种工作的基本资料。如果没有中国植物志，中国植物分类学要赶上世界先进水平是有困难的。有了植物志，高等学校的植物分类学教科书也容易编写了。现在我国高等学校中还没有根据中国植物写成的分类学教科书。
    编著全国植物志，需要有集体主义精神和大批人力的协作来展开全面植物的调查及研究工作，这也是具有资产阶级个人主义思想的人所不大感兴趣的工作，因为这工作需要花费很长的时间和很大的精力，在解放以前，中国植物分类学家经常谈这件事，但只不过谈谈而已。解放以后，也还有不少分类学家认为我国编著植物志的条件还不成熟。在这次整风运动中，植物研究所的植物分类学工作者批判了个人主义思想，同时在全国各项工作大跃进浪潮的推动下，大家感到像中国植物志那样重要的工作难道不能跃进？于是便进行摸底工作——看看到底有没有条件立即开展编著工作。他们在思想跃进以后，认为条件是有的，困难是可以克服的，解放八年以来进行的大量调查研究工作，已经积累了一定数量的资料；有些古老的标本和有关书籍，苏联有关方面已答应尽量协助；青年人可以通过编著植物志的工作得到培养，科学队伍也可以迅速成长。经过仔细的计算以后，大家认为只要拿出革命干劲，一面开始编写、一面继续调查工作、一面培养干部，三者齐头并进，完全有可能在十年内完成这一巨大任务。植物研究所把这项倡议提出后，立即得到了有关研究单位如林业土壤研究所、南京中山植物园、华南植物研究所的植物分类学工作者的热烈响应。
