Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 4th. Qinghai Province's livestock has been increasing rapidly. According to statistics at the end of 1957, the province had a total of 17,178,000 head of livestock of various kinds, an increase of more than 140% compared with 1949, with livestock in some areas increasing by about tenfold. Due to the development of animal husbandry, the purchasing power of herdsmen of all ethnic groups has increased five and a half times, and their lives have been improved. The grasslands everywhere present a new atmosphere of "unity in production" and "prosperity for both people and livestock."

At present, a high tide of socialist transformation of animal husbandry has gradually formed in pastoral areas. Livestock production cooperatives and joint state-private livestock farms are springing up like mushrooms after a rain. The production enthusiasm of all herdsmen is very high. They plan to double the province's livestock in the second five-year plan period, striving to reach more than 34 million head.

    青海牲畜八年增加一倍多
    牧业生产合作社正在纷纷建立
    据新华社西宁4日电　青海省的牲畜增长速度很快。截至1957年年底统计，全省共有各种牲畜一七一七点八万头，比1949年增加了140％以上，部分地区的牲畜增加了十倍左右。由于畜牧业的发展，各族牧民的购买力提高五倍半，生活得到了改善，草原上到处呈现着“团结生产”和“人畜两旺”的新气象。
    目前，畜牧业的社会主义改造高潮已在牧业区逐渐形成。牧业生产合作社和公私合营牧场像雨后春笋一样建立起来。全体牧民的生产积极性十分高涨，他们计划在第二个五年计划期中，使全省牲畜比现在的数字再增加一倍，争取达到三千四百多万头。
