Cotton Planting This Year is Good and Early
Cotton Planting Area Has Completed More Than 95% of the National Plan
    (Our Dispatch) It is learned from the Ministry of Agriculture that the cotton sowing work in the vast cotton-growing areas of the country has been basically completed victoriously. Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Hunan, Zhejiang, Sichuan and other provinces, as well as Guanzhong, Southern Shaanxi, Southern Shanxi, Northern Jiangsu, Northern Jiangxi, Yunnan, Binchuan and other places, and the Southern Hebei cotton area, completed or basically completed the cotton sowing task before "Grain Rain". Most areas of Hebei and Jiangsu, Southeastern Jiangxi, Beijing, Shanghai, Gansu, and some cotton areas of Liaoning, started sowing in mid-April, and will complete or basically complete the sowing task by the end of April. Only areas with relatively late seasons such as Western Liaoning, Northern Shaanxi, and Eastern Hebei have just begun sowing. Up to now, it is estimated that the national cotton field sowing area has reached more than 95% of the national planned cotton planting task.
    The first characteristic of this year's cotton sowing work is that the preparatory work before sowing was done well. One or two months before sowing, Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Liaoning and Beijing and other provinces and cities held a series of cotton professional meetings, formulated leap forward plans and measures to realize the plans. As a result, all localities carried out intensive cotton planting preparation work. A large amount of cotton seed of improved varieties was transferred and replaced between provinces. Not only was the work of deep plowing, land preparation and moisture conservation done well throughout the country, but also the amount of basal fertilizer applied to cotton fields was more than doubled compared with previous years.
    The second characteristic is that sowing was earlier than in previous years, and sowing was fast and concentrated. This year, in many areas, the cotton sowing work was advanced compared with last year due to the "thousands of people and horses working together". From the beginning to the end of sowing, it was shortened by three to five days compared with previous years. In many cotton areas in Hubei, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan and other provinces, sowing only started during "Grain Rain" last year, while this year, all sowing was completed by "Grain Rain".
    This year, Hebei Province suffered from severe spring drought, and cotton fields in many areas needed to be sown under drought resistance. Under the mobilization of the provincial party committee's fighting slogan of "guarantee sowing without rain, guarantee a bumper harvest in drought", the whole party and the whole people quickly launched a high tide of drought resistance and cotton sowing. By April 27, 75% of the province's cotton fields had been sown.
    The third characteristic of the sowing work is that the quality of cotton sowing has been greatly improved compared with the past, especially in the special districts, counties, and cities that strive to achieve a yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. The good quality of cotton sowing this year is mainly reflected in three aspects: In terms of seed treatment, it is better and more common than in the past. Most cotton areas in Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Hubei, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and other provinces carried out grain selection of cotton seeds and seed dressing with agents, covering seeds or soaking seeds in warm water to improve the purity and germination rate of cotton seeds and eliminate and prevent diseases. On the other hand, the sowing technology has been improved. Generally, the sowing lines are straight and the depth is consistent. More than 80% of the 9 million mu of cotton fields in Hubei Province applied basal fertilizer and seed fertilizer, and strip sowing was carried out. The third aspect is that all localities not only paid attention to the quality of seeds, but also appropriately increased the amount of sowing. Generally, there are twelve to fifteen catties per mu. Due to the appropriate increase in the amount of sowing, a favorable foundation has been laid for ensuring full seedlings, uniform seedlings, and strong seedlings.
    Cotton fields sown before April 18 in various places have generally emerged, and some have already had two or three true leaves, and the cotton seedlings are neat and strong. Cotton fields sown after April 18 are emerging from the soil.
    (Our Dispatch) The northernmost cotton-growing area in my country - the 350,000 mu of cotton in the Manas River Basin Reclamation Area of ​​the Xinjiang Military Region Production and Construction Corps is being sown intensely. A huge group of tractors is dragging cotton planters, traveling back and forth on large areas of farmland at a speed of 40,000 to 50,000 mu per day. Thousands of employees from various farms are clearing weeds and cleaning field ditches in the fields day and night. It is expected that all cotton in the entire reclamation area will be sown by May 3.
    This year, the cotton sowing in the Manas Reclamation Area paid special attention to quality. The cotton fields of various farms have been autumn ploughed and winter irrigated. After the land thawed in the spring, they were harrowed and ridged again. The soil is loose and the moisture content is very sufficient. After the water conservancy campaign last winter and this spring, a dozen irrigation areas on the west bank of the Manas River were connected into one, which can form a mutually supporting irrigation network. All cotton fields adopted the latest sowing technology - square nest sowing. Cotton fields sown using this method can be cultivated vertically and horizontally, the cotton plants are evenly distributed, and the ventilation and light are good on all sides, which can increase the yield per unit area by 10% to 20%. According to the characteristics of the relatively short frost-free period in the Manas Reclamation Area, all farms have adopted Soviet early-maturing varieties. (Tan Feng) (with picture)
    In order to achieve the cotton production increase target ahead of schedule, cotton areas have generally adopted the above-mentioned production increase measures this year.

### 今年播种棉花又好又早  植棉面积已完成国家计划百分之九十五以上

    今年播种棉花又好又早
    植棉面积已完成国家计划百分之九十五以上
    本报讯　从农业部获悉：全国广大棉区的棉花播种工作，已基本上胜利完成。山东、河南、湖北、安徽、湖南、浙江、四川等省和关中、陕南、晋南、苏北、赣北、云南、宾川等地以及冀南棉区，在“谷雨”前完成了或基本上完成了播棉任务。河北、江苏的大部分地区，赣东南、北京、上海、甘肃、辽宁的部分棉区，都在4月中旬开始播种，到4月底可完成或基本上完成播种任务。只有辽西、陕北、冀东等季节比较迟的地区刚开始播种。到目前为止，估计全国棉田播种面积已经达到国家计划植棉任务的95％以上。
   今年棉花播种工作的第一个特点是：播种前的准备工作做得好。在播种前一两个月，山东、河北、河南、湖北、江苏、山西、陕西、辽宁和北京等省、市都召开了一系列的棉花专业会议，制订跃进规划和实现规划的措施。随着各地进行了紧张的植棉准备工作。省际间大量调剂和更换了棉花良种。全国各地不仅深耕、整地保墒工作做得好，棉田基肥施用量也比往年增加一倍以上。
    第二个特点是播种比往年提早，下种又快又集中。今年许多地区的播棉工作，由于采取了“千人万马齐出动”的作战行动，播种期都比去年提前。从播种开始到结束，比往年缩短了三到五天。湖北、浙江、安徽、湖南等省的许多棉区，去年“谷雨”才播种，而今年“谷雨”已全部播完。
    今年河北省春旱严重，许多地区的棉田需要进行抗旱播种，在省委“无雨保播种、干旱保丰收”的战斗口号动员下，全党全民很快地掀起了抗旱播棉的高潮，到4月27日全省棉田75％已经播完。
    播种工作的第三个特点是棉花播种质量比过去有很大提高，特别是争取达到亩产皮棉百斤的专、县、市更为突出。今年棉花播种质量好，主要表现在三个方面：在种子处理方面，比过去做得好，做得普遍。河南、山东、河北、陕西、山西、湖北、江苏、浙江等省大部棉区进行了粒选棉种和药剂拌种、闷种或温汤浸种，以提高棉种纯度和发芽率，消灭和预防病害。另一方面是改进和提高了播种技术。一般做到了播行端直、深浅一致。湖北省九百多万亩棉田，有80％以上施了基肥、种肥，作到了条播。第三方面是各地不仅注意了种子的质量，并适当增加了播种量。一般每亩都有十二斤到十五斤。由于播种量的适当增加，对保证全苗、匀苗、壮苗打下了有利基础。
    各地在4月18日以前播完的棉田，一般都已出苗，有的已有二、三片真叶，棉苗整齐健壮。4月18日以后播种的棉田，正在拱土出苗。
    本报讯　我国最北部的植棉区——新疆军区生产兵团玛纳斯河流域垦区三十五万亩棉花正在紧张播种。庞大的拖拉机群拖着播棉机，每天以四、五万亩的速度，在大面积田地上往来奔驰。各农场成千上万的职工不分日夜地在田间扫除杂草，清理田渠。预计到5月3日全垦区棉花即可全部播完。
    今年玛纳斯垦区的棉花播种特别注意质量。各农场的棉田都进行了秋翻和冬灌，春天土地解冻后又进行了耙耱，土壤松散，墒地很足。经过去冬今春兴修水利的运动，玛纳斯河西岸十几个灌区连成一片，可以互相支援的灌溉网。全部棉田都采用了最新播种技术——方形窝播法播种。用这种方法播种的棉田，能够进行纵横中耕，棉株分布均匀，四面通风透光，可以使单位面积产量提高10％至20％。各农场根据玛纳斯垦区无霜期比较短的特点，全部棉花都采用了苏联早熟良种。　（谈风）（附图片）
    为提前实现棉花增产指标，各棉区今年普遍采取了以上这些增产措施。
