Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th - TASS reports: In a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, Khrushchev accused the United States and Britain of conducting nuclear bomb tests in recent days, considering this an attempt to undermine efforts to permanently halt the testing of nuclear weapons.

Khrushchev said that such actions are in no way consistent with the peaceful declarations repeatedly made by the U.S. and British governments recently. It is perfectly clear that this action, openly challenging the will of the people of all countries, can only return the world to its original starting point on this important issue, and once again trigger a chain reaction of atomic and hydrogen bomb explosion tests. We believe that every effort must be made to prevent this development of events.

Khrushchev's reply to Eisenhower's letter of April 28 was delivered to the U.S. State Department by Soviet Ambassador to the United States Menshikov on May 10.

Khrushchev expressed regret that the U.S. government did not respond to the Soviet government's proposal to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev pointed out in the letter that the Soviet government believes that the United States and Britain must first, like the Soviet Union, stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, and resolve this fundamental issue without delay. Khrushchev said: It can be seen from your letter that you attach great importance to the work of experts in studying the technical details related to supervising the agreement to stop the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons. Therefore, although we have serious doubts about this, we are still willing to try this method. The Soviet government agrees that both sides should send experts to immediately begin studying methods of detecting violations of an agreement to stop nuclear weapons testing, and to complete this work within the shortest possible timeframe.

At the same time, Khrushchev once again expressed his hope that Eisenhower would support the Soviet proposal to cease testing atomic and hydrogen weapons.

Khrushchev also mentioned in the letter that the Soviet Union had long proposed establishing aerial inspection zones in order to prevent sudden attacks in Central Europe, the Far East, and corresponding regions of the United States in advance. However, the Soviet Union's specific proposals on this issue have not been positively received by the U.S. government. Khrushchev stressed that these Soviet proposals are still valid.

Referring to the need to stop the flight of U.S. military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs towards the Soviet border, Khrushchev pointed out that the method adopted by the United States in the Security Council is not proof of a genuine intention to reach an agreement on a mutually acceptable basis, but an attempt to use the majority in the Security Council to exert pressure on the Soviet Union. Khrushchev pointed out that the U.S. proposal to establish a system of inspection over the Arctic cannot eliminate the threat posed by these actions of the U.S. Strategic Air Command to the cause of international peace.

### 赫鲁晓夫指责美英进行核试验  主张派遣专家立即研究监督停止核试验协议的方法

　　赫鲁晓夫指责美英进行核试验
    主张派遣专家立即研究监督停止核试验协议的方法
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：赫鲁晓夫在给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信中指责最近几天美国和英国所进行的核弹试验，认为这是企图破坏为永远停止试验核武器而做的努力。
    赫鲁晓夫说，这种行动同美英两国政府最近一再宣布的爱好和平的声明无论如何是不协调的。完全清楚，这种公开向各国人民意志挑战的行动只能使世界在这个重要问题上再回到原来的起点上，并且再次引起原子弹和氢弹爆炸试验的连锁反应。我们认为，必须尽一切努力来防止事态的这种发展。
    赫鲁晓夫这封答复艾森豪威尔4月28日来信的复信已经在5月10日由苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫交给美国国务院。
    赫鲁晓夫对美国政府没有答复苏联政府提出的关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议表示遗憾。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中指出，苏联政府认为，美国和英国首先必须像苏联所做的那样，停止试验原子武器和氢武器，并且毫不迟延地解决这个原则性的问题。赫鲁晓夫说：从您的信中可以看到，您很重视由专家就同监督关于停止原子武器和氢武器试验的协议有关的技术细节进行研究工作。因此，我们虽然对这点有严重的怀疑，但是还是愿意试验一下这种方法。苏联政府同意双方派遣专家立即着手研究发现关于停止核武器试验的协议可能遭到的破坏的方法，并且使这一工作在预定的最短期限内完成。
    赫鲁晓夫同时再一次表示希望艾森豪威尔支持苏联关于停止试验原子武器和氢武器的建议。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中还谈到，苏联早就建议建立空中视察区以便事先防止在中欧、远东以及美国的相应地区发生突然的进攻。但是，苏联关于这个问题的具体建议还没有受到美国政府的积极对待。赫鲁晓夫着重指出，苏联这些建议仍然是有效的。
    赫鲁晓夫在谈到必须停止携带原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机朝苏联边境飞行的问题时指出，美国在安全理事会中采用的方法，不是证明真正打算在相互能够接受的基础上达成协议，而是企图利用安理会中的多数对苏联施加压力。赫鲁晓夫指出，美国关于建立在北极上空进行视察的制度的建议决不能消除美国战略空军的这种行动对国际和平的事业所造成的威胁。
