　　Socialism is Heaven, You Can't Get There Without Technology!
　　——A Collection of Folk Songs Celebrating the Agricultural Technological Revolution
　　Work Hard on Technological Reform
    Socialism is heaven,
    You can't get there without technology.
    For a comprehensive Great Leap Forward,
    Everyone must use their brains.
    Surpass satellites, exceed rockets,
    Work hard on technological reform.
      (Changge, Henan)
    Ten thousand people's meeting roars to the heavens,
    Technological revolution in the year '58,
    Burn away conservative thoughts,
    Technological innovation will surely be realized.
      (Hong'an, Hubei)
    Cheng Lijun of Shangru Township,
    Has a great drive for production leap forward,
    The sore on his foot is the size of a teacup,
    So swollen it scares people to look at it.
    Called to attend a technical conference in the county,
    He limped step by step to the county town,
    Others advised him not to go,
    He said, "Not understanding technology is even more painful."
      (Hong'an, Hubei)
    Water pump, wheel turns,
    Pumping water forms a canopy of umbrellas,
    Can irrigate fields,
    The Dragon King is so angry his eyes go white.
      (Yuxian, Henan)
    Night school changed to technical school,
    Promoting good experiences every day,
    Party members and Youth League members take the lead,
    If the reform isn't done well, you're no hero.
    Use your brains until they break, think until your heart rots,
    Reform work surpasses electricity.
        (Lushan, Henan)
　　One Person Offers a Plan
    One person offers a plan,
    Three people modify a tool.
    The mill is modified in seven days,
    The anti-frost device is modified in twenty days.
        (Xinzheng, Henan)
    Find Zhuge Liang, visit the generals,
    Our township is determined to change.
    The secretary takes action, the carpenter takes the lead,
    Mechanization is guaranteed to be realized.
        (Changge, Henan)
    Break old conventions and old experiences,
    Drive and technology must be fully possessed,
    Only working without learning new technology,
    Is like going to the county by a winding road.
          (Gaoling, Shaanxi)
    Brains think, hands wear out,
    For invention, forget to eat,
    If it fails, start again,
    If it succeeds, don't be complacent.
        (Changge, Henan)
    The machine starts with a thunderous roar,
    Making new tea with a fragrant taste,
    In the past, it was tiring by hand,
    Now it's fast and comfortable.
    Water conservancy machine makes tea,
    Young and old alike praise it,
    Who is the technician?
    It is commune member Wang Chunhua.
        (Fuan, Fujian)
　　Everyone is Busy Improving Tools
    Buzzing, clanging!
    Everyone is busy improving tools,
    Every household becomes a small factory,
    Everyone is better than Zhuge Liang.
        (Linru, Henan)
    Who says human power cannot conquer nature?
    Iron dragon pumps water to the top of the mountain,
    High slopes and dry land are filled with water,
    The sun laughs and goes crazy.
        (Tianzhu, Guizhou)
    Great revolution in agricultural technology,
    Inventions and creations are done happily,
    Plows are modified, carts are modified,
    Hundreds of new-style farm implements.
    The most effective is the hand-cranked mill,
    Saves labor and is simple,
    Grinds more than six hundred catties of flour a day,
    Grinds one thousand three hundred catties of flour in two days.
    The masses call it a small steel mill,
    Everyone likes to see it.
        (Changge, Henan)
　　Promoting New Farm Implements
    Old-fashioned wooden plow,
    Plowing shallow and wasting strength.
    Modified new-style plow,
    Deep plowing five inches is nothing strange.
        (Changshu, Jiangsu)
    Seeding machines go to the countryside,
    Ji Yuan village is bustling.
    The iron chain turns, the tires move,
    Seeds run down the funnel,

    Drilling several furrows at once,
    The villagers praise it after seeing it,
    Rely on it for increased production without difficulty.
        (Dingbian, Shaanxi)
    The Sixth Team is determined,
    Manure accumulation has changed,
    Working overnight,
    Great improvement in tools.
    Two double tracks,
    Everyone praises it,
    Efficiency greatly increased,
    Increased production is guaranteed.
        (Haiyan, Zhejiang)
    The old plow has been used for thousands of years,
    The muddy feet plow shallower and shallower,
    The new-style plow enters the ground,
    Old soil turns over to see the blue sky.
        (Puan, Guizhou)
　　Singing About Cart-ization
    Xiangyang Prefecture is cart-ized,
    Ten thousand carrying poles are all put down,
    Pushing small carts squeaking,
    Men and women sing,
    Transportation no longer burdens the shoulders,
　　Everyone thanks the Communist Party.
        (Xiangyang, Hubei)
    Building roads straight and smooth under the lamp,
    Every family in the village makes new carts,
    Donating money, donating materials, donating clever plans,
    Two hundred carts made in two nights.
        (Chao'an, Guangdong)
    One township realizes cart-ization,
    The news spreads to thousands of families,
    Thousands of villages spread the experience,
    Every commune in the whole county is blooming.
        (Chaoshan, Guangdong)
