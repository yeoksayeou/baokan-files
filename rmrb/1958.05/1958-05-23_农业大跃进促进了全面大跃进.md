The Great Leap Forward in Agriculture Promotes an Overall Great Leap Forward
Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

Currently, in Hunan Province, a mass movement high tide of a comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, centered on industrial and agricultural production, has emerged. It is advancing valiantly and unstoppably with the force of a bamboo splitting. Since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee last year, we have tightly grasped the rectification campaign as the guiding principle and carried out a more in-depth and systematic nationwide rectification movement. In rural areas, focusing first on the grain issue, and then centering on the struggle between the two roads, we conducted a profound great debate on matters of right and wrong, fundamentally crushing and discrediting capitalist ideology; criticizing the idea of only caring about the individual and not the collective and the state; and improved the relationship between agricultural cooperative cadres and members. Through the great debate and from their own experiences, the broad masses of people strengthened their determination to take the socialist road, recognizing that "capitalist disaster" was the basic reason for the poor production of some agricultural cooperatives last year, transitioning from "people joining the cooperatives" to "hearts also joining the cooperatives." At the same time, after the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle, rectification movements were fully launched in enterprises, schools, government offices, and special and county levels, criticizing various forms of individualism and right-leaning conservative thinking, and changing the work style of cadres. In particular, the sending down of cadres, their participation in labor, and the universal establishment of experimental fields have greatly strengthened the relationship between leaders and the masses. The rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, this ideological revolution and Great Leap Forward of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology, powerfully promoted the high tide and Great Leap Forward in production.

The Great Liberation of Thought in the Great Upsurge of Production

Under the circumstances of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of people, under the leadership of the Party, displayed unparalleled revolutionary drive. After several months of hard work and arduous struggles, they have achieved unprecedented great successes on all fronts. A force of agricultural labor, accounting for 50%-60% of the total rural population, invested 320 million labor days in the battle of water conservancy construction, completing approximately 1.5 billion cubic meters of earth and stone water conservancy projects, expanding and improving the irrigated area by more than 28 million mu; building more than 11,000 reservoirs, which is four times the total number of reservoirs built in the eight years since liberation. They completed the accumulation of 35 billion dan of fertilizer, with an average fertilizer application rate of 600 dan per mu of farmland, which is six times the total amount of fertilizer accumulated last year. Afforestation covered 20 million mu, nearly seven times that of last year. Advanced production technologies and experiences have been extensively and widely promoted. Deep plowing and close planting have been universally implemented in rice cultivation, and sowing and transplanting have generally been carried out much earlier than in previous years. Millions of people displayed unparalleled revolutionary heroism, their slogans being: "Compete with severe cold for ruthlessness, compete with time for speed, compete with the Foolish Old Man for determination, and compete with Mount Tai for height"; "Cold weather cannot cool hot hearts, frozen ground cannot freeze determination, heavy snow cannot cover confidence, and strong winds cannot shake perseverance"; even in freezing weather, production continued to be carried out enthusiastically. In Bailu Township, Changsha County, the masses were mobilized to work hard for 25 days, renovating a 40-li long river channel, dredging 3,800 mountain ditches, and controlling the mountain floods that occurred several times each year. When large-scale production movements advanced and a large amount of labor "deficit" appeared, initially, the masses used torches and kerosene lamps for all-night "night battles"; subsequently, tool reform spread like wildfire, rapidly forming a mass movement throughout the province. In just over a month, the province created, improved, and promoted more than 7,000 types (including identical types) and more than 4 million pieces of production, drainage, transportation, and processing tools. A large number of aerial transportation cableways were erected in mountainous and hilly areas, and more than 20 counties basically achieved transportation "vehicularization" and "ship transportation." The tool reform movement, with several times or even dozens of times higher labor efficiency than before, powerfully accelerated the progress of the production movement.

The Great Leap Forward in agricultural production has powerfully promoted the comprehensive leap forward in other aspects of work. In the first quarter of this year, the output value of local industry completed 105.3% of the plan, an increase of 17.9% over the same period last year. In approximately two months, nearly 60,000 small and medium-sized factories, mines, and handicraft workshops were established throughout the province. In Oujiacha Township, Yiyang, 433 small factories were established from scratch in 40 days. In Liling, a cooperative opened a coal mine for only four jiao. In Hengyang City, a plastic factory used an ancestral hall and spent only 20,000 yuan on infrastructure, and the annual output value could reach 1.3 million yuan. The Two-Anti movement and the technical innovation movement in factories and mining enterprises, as well as the work in transportation, commerce, and other fields, have achieved great successes. The Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production has promoted the rapid development of cultural, educational, scientific, and health undertakings. Illiteracy elimination has progressed rapidly, and there are already more than 4,600 people-run middle schools in the province; the patriotic health campaign of eliminating the Four Pests and promoting hygiene is also being universally carried out. All of this shows that the mental outlook of the broad masses of people is undergoing profound changes: communist ideas and customs of loving labor, loving the collective, and dissolving individual interests into collective interests are growing and developing. This situation is in stark contrast to the situation last spring and summer, when people were disunited, lacked enthusiasm, and production was not good. People are the most basic and active factor in the production process; the ideas people hold determine their attitude towards production; and the attitude people take towards production determines the size and speed of production achievements. Without the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, people's direction could not be clear and firm, "superstitions" could not be broken, thoughts could not be liberated, and the situation of a production leap forward could not have been formed.

The vigorous spirit and revolutionary drive of the broad masses of people and cadres in building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results have promoted the liberation of our thinking; the in-depth study of the spirit of the Central Committee meetings in January and March has made people's thinking even more invigorated. Things that we did not dare to think about or do in the past, we now dare to think about and do boldly. We now realize that things that we originally thought could only be done slowly and on a small scale can now be done quickly and on a large scale. During this period, we deeply appreciated the great significance of "one day equals twenty years." Once liberated, productive forces, if guided in the right direction and given sufficient drive, can become a great material force that shakes the mountains and rivers. As the Central Committee pointed out: "The development of social productive forces requires socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds; the victory of socialist revolution and the liberation of people's minds, in turn, promote the leap forward of social productive forces; this leap forward of productive forces, in turn, continues to stimulate the improvement of socialist relations of production and the progress of people's thinking." The path traversed in the past year has fully demonstrated the complete correctness of this assertion, both positively and negatively.

The Key to Continued Leap Forward
Lies in Rapidly Expanding Cultivated Area

The current Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in Hunan is only a beginning. How to accelerate construction in accordance with the general line has become a major problem before us. Regarding the question of whether or not there can be a leap forward in the development of industrial and agricultural production, after this period of practice, especially comparing the construction upsurges of 1956 and 1958 with the anti-"rash advance" of 1957, the question has been resolved. But how big and how high the leap forward can be is still debated. There are two opinions: one is to greatly liberate the mind, ride the waves, strive for advancement, and develop industrial and agricultural production at a faster rate, so as to promote a comprehensive leap forward in socialist construction; the other is to urge but not advance, to have strength but not enough, to hesitate and look around, to "gradually advance" but not dare to "leap forward." The two kinds of thinking represent two types of people: the former represents the broad masses of people and cadres who adhere to the correct line of the Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, and the latter represents a small number of cadres and the masses. Either they have not completely eliminated the influence of bourgeois ideology, or they have not liberated their minds and their way of thinking is not correct, so they "see things but not people," and they cannot see the masses, and in fact they cannot really see "things" clearly. For those who are influenced by bourgeois ideology, we must help them thoroughly eliminate the influence of bourgeois ideology; for those who have not liberated their minds, we must help them liberate their spirits and liberate their thoughts. We have analyzed the conditions in all aspects and believe that Hunan already has the conditions and possibilities for a Great Leap Forward. We believe that the tasks of the ten-year plan for agricultural development in our province have the conditions to be completed five years ahead of schedule; the total output value of local industry has the conditions to catch up with and surpass the total output value of agriculture in five years. Accelerating construction at such a speed can strive to basically change Hunan's economic face in five years or a little more.

Based on such a vision, we have re-examined and studied the economic and natural conditions of our province. The basic situation in our province at present is: less cultivated land and more people. The total population of the province has exceeded 36 million, and there are only 58 million mu of cultivated land, with an average of only 1.6 mu per person. The unit area yield of grain is not high now. The area dedicated to planting cash crops is only 3.5 million mu, accounting for only 6% of the total cultivated area. The actual production performance last year was: grain accounted for 41.8% of the total agricultural and sideline output value, and cash crops plus timber and oil tea and tung oil output value accounted for only 7.62% of the total agricultural and sideline output value; the industrial output value accounted for only 21.07% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. Judging from these ratios and relationships, the existing area of ​​grain crops cannot be reduced, and the area of ​​cash crops must be greatly increased. Otherwise, the income and accumulation of the people cannot grow rapidly, and the needs of industrial development cannot be met. In order to quickly change this situation, to ensure the continuous growth of grain production, and to plant a large number of cash crops, so that industrial and agricultural production can achieve a leaping comprehensive development, the key issue is to rapidly and massively expand the cultivated area.

Is it possible to expand the cultivated area in Hunan? We believe that it is entirely possible. The total area of ​​the province is 306 million mu. In addition to the existing cultivated land, forest land, suitable barren hills, river and lake water surfaces, urban industrial and mining areas, residential areas, and transportation land, there are more than 60 million mu of reclaimable barren hills and barren sandbars. These lands were impossible to develop and utilize in the era of small-scale peasant economy. Now the province has realized agricultural collectivization, and it has the conditions for large-scale land reclamation. As long as we rely on the collective strength of agricultural cooperatives and necessary support from the state, we can make full use of it. Therefore, we plan to expand the cultivated area of ​​the province by about 20 million mu in three to five years. The province has now reclaimed more than 1 million mu. Many agricultural cooperatives with land reclamation conditions are now organizing land reclamation in a planned manner. The province is expected to reclaim about 5 million mu this year. Wengjiang Township, Pingjiang County, originally had 15,700 mu of farmland. In the past two years, it has reclaimed 2,750 mu and has planted cash crops such as tea, Atractylodes lancea, and jute. It plans to reclaim another 1,500 mu this year. Some of the barren sandbars in Dongting Lake that are exposed above the water surface are being reclaimed by agricultural cooperatives. More than 50,000 mu of the Qianliang Lake barren sandbar have been reclaimed by agricultural cooperatives.

In the past, the main reason why we did not or did not dare to raise the issue of large-scale land reclamation was that our minds were not liberated, and our thinking was very limited. We were afraid that land reclamation would cause soil erosion, afraid that there would be insufficient labor, afraid that it would affect the yield of existing cultivated land, and afraid of reducing the forest area. Obviously, this is a negative "status quo maintenance" idea, which resulted in the thought being confined to the circle of the existing cultivated area, unable to break the circle. When the mind is liberated, the vision is wider, and we think farther and bigger, we dare to break through the "circle" of the existing cultivated area. We believe that Hunan should adopt the policy of simultaneously increasing unit area yield and expanding cultivated area, give full play to its drive, transform nature, advance towards barren hills and barren sandbars, transform barren hills into terraced land and terraced fields, and transform barren sandbars into fertile fields.

Will large-scale land reclamation cause soil erosion? Now it seems that the problem is not whether to reclaim land or not, but what attitude we take towards nature. Do we adopt an attitude that only cares about land reclamation and not soil erosion, only cares about the present and not the future, and plunder nature? Or do we adopt an attitude that fully and rationally utilizes natural resources, both reclaims land and prevents soil erosion? We resolutely deny the former attitude and adopt the latter attitude. Years of practice have proved that in areas with soil erosion, simply preventing it passively without combining it with active utilization is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and cannot mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people. Wherever land reclamation and soil and water conservation measures are combined, the situation is guided according to local conditions, turning harm into benefit, the masses can be mobilized to a greater extent. On the other hand, in the past, in areas with severe soil erosion, we only emphasized afforestation and greening of barren hills to prevent soil erosion, but because it was not combined with the immediate interests of the masses, the effect was not good. Now, many agricultural cooperatives have adopted methods of combining grain and forests (economic forests), planting cash crops on the mountains, combining annual crops and perennial crops, and combining immediate interests and long-term interests, and have also adopted engineering measures (opening slope soil into terraced soil, changing vertical cultivation to horizontal cultivation, building fish-scale pits, sand prevention ditches, etc.) and biological measures (planting crops and afforestation), which greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses and greatly accelerated the speed of soil and water conservation. Some people are worried that such large-scale land reclamation will reduce the forest area and reduce the vegetation coverage rate. We believe that on the existing basis, while reclaiming land, mobilizing the masses to afforest on a large scale can make the forest area reach 158 million mu, and the vegetation coverage rate will increase from the current 27% to 50%. Such controlled large-scale land reclamation is not dangerous, but beneficial and harmless.

After we have completed the task of expanding the cultivated area by about 20 million mu, Hunan will develop from the current 58 million mu of cultivated land to 78 million to 80 million mu, and the cultivated area will be approximately equal to that of Japan. The area of ​​cash crops and feed crops will expand from 3.5 million mu to 18 million to 20 million mu. This is a major revolution in production in Hunan, which will promote the development of industrial and agricultural production and economic and cultural aspects more rapidly.

After increasing the cultivated area, we will be able to more thoroughly solve the contradiction between grain and cash crops competing for land; we will be able to make full use of the existing grain crop area, and strive to increase the unit area yield from all aspects, to ensure the realization of the grain production plan. The expansion of the cash crop area will be able to expand crops such as cotton, ramie, sugar crops, and oil crops to ensure the supply of industrial raw materials and further promote industrial development. The expansion of feed bases will be able to ensure the large-scale development of animal husbandry, especially pigs. In addition, with the development of economic forests in mountainous areas, we will be able to increase accumulation and develop heavy industry and light industry more quickly. The development of industry, in turn, can powerfully support agriculture. The development of industrial and agricultural production will inevitably accelerate the process of cultural revolution and technological revolution. This enables us to seize the Great Leap Forward in land reclamation and agricultural production to promote the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in socialist construction.

Hunan, like all parts of the country, has abundant natural resources that urgently need to be developed by us. The great Chinese people possess infinitely rich creativity. We firmly believe that as long as we strengthen the leadership of the Party, closely rely on the masses, boldly mobilize the masses, and implement the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, which is stipulated by the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong, we will surely liberate people's minds, give play to the unlimited creativity of the people, and rapidly change the face of Hunan and the whole country, and we will surely be able to catch up with and surpass the United Kingdom in fifteen years or even less.

    农业大跃进促进了全面大跃进
    中共湖南省委第一书记　周小舟
    现在，湖南省已经出现了一个以工农业生产为中心的社会主义建设全面大跃进的群众运动高潮，它正以破竹之势，锐不可当地奋勇前进。去年八届三中全会之后，我们紧紧抓住了整风之纲，更深入更系统地开展了全民整风运动。在农村首先以粮食问题为中心，紧接着围绕两条道路的斗争，进行了深刻的大是大非的大论战，从根本上击溃和搞臭了资本主义思想；批判了只顾个人、不顾集体、国家的思想；改进了农业社干部和社员之间的关系。广大群众从大论战、从切身体会中，坚定了走社会主义大道的决心，认识了“资本主义灾”是去年某些农业社生产搞得不好的基本原因，由“人入社”进为“心也入社”。同时反右派斗争胜利之后，在企业、学校、机关和专、县整风运动全面展开，批判了各种各样的个人主义思想和右倾保守思想，改变了干部作风。特别是干部下放，干部参加劳动，普遍搞试验田，更大大密切了领导人员与群众的关系。整风运动和反右派斗争这个兴无灭资的思想大革命、大跃进，有力地推动了生产的大高潮、大跃进。
    生产的大高潮思想的大解放
    在大跃进的形势下，广大群众在党的领导下发挥了无比的革命干劲，经过几个月的苦干苦战，在各个战线上获得了空前未有的伟大成绩。占农村总人口50％——60％的农业劳动大军，以三亿二千万个劳动日投入兴修水利的战斗，完成了十五亿左右土石方的水利工程，扩大和改善灌溉面积二千八百多万亩；兴建水库一万一千多座，为解放八年来兴建水库总和的四倍。完成了三百五十亿担的积肥量，每亩田土平均施肥量可达六百担，为去年积肥总数的六倍。造林二千万亩，将近去年的七倍。先进的生产技术和经验得到了大量和普遍的推广，水稻种植普遍实行了深耕、密植，播种插秧普遍比往年大大提早。千百万群众显示了无比的革命英雄气概，他们的口号是“与严寒比狠，与时间比快，与愚公比决心，与泰山比高低”；“天冷冷不了热心，地冻冻不了决心，大雪盖不住信心，狂风吹不动恒心”；冰天雪地，生产照常搞得热火朝天。长沙县有个百禄乡，发动群众，苦战二十五天，改修了一条四十里长的河道，疏通了三千八百多条山圳，制伏了每年数次逞凶的山洪灾害。当大规模的生产运动向前发展，出现大量劳动“赤字”的时候，开始，群众是打火把、点汽灯，“夜战”通宵；随后，工具改革有如星火燎原，迅速形成一个全省范围的群众运动。在短短一个多月的时间内，全省创造、改良和推广了七千多种（包括种类相同的）、四百多万件生产、排灌、运输、加工工具。在山区、丘陵区大量架设了空中运输索道，有二十多个县基本上实现了运输“车子化”和“船运化”。工具改革运动，以几倍甚至几十倍于以往的高工效，有力地加速了生产运动的进展。
    农业生产的大跃进，有力地推动了其他各方面事业的全面跃进，今年第一季度地方工业的产值完成了计划的105.3％，比去年同期增加了17.9％。在大约两个月的时间内，全省兴办了近六万个小、中型厂矿和手工工场。益阳有个欧家岔乡，白手起家，四十天办了小型工场四百三十三个。醴陵有一个社，只花四角钱就开办了一个煤矿。衡阳市有一个塑料厂，利用祠堂，只花二万元钱的基建费，年产值可达一百三十万元。厂矿企业的双反运动和技术革新运动，交通、运输、商业等方面的工作，都取得了巨大的成就。工农业生产的大跃进推动了文教、科学和卫生事业的飞跃发展，扫盲进展很快，全省民办中学已有四千六百多所；除四害、讲卫生运动，也都在普遍开展。所有这一切，都说明了广大人民群众的精神面貌正在发生着深刻的变化：热爱劳动、热爱集体、把个人利益溶化在集体利益之中的共产主义思想、风气正在成长、发展。这种情景，和去年春夏人心不齐、劲头不足、生产不很好的局面。显然成为尖锐的对比。人，是生产过程中最基本、最活跃的因素；人们有着什么样的思想，就决定着人们对生产采取什么样的态度；人们对生产所采取的态度，又决定着生产成绩的大小，进度的快慢。没有整风运动和反右派斗争的胜利，人们的方向不能明确、坚定，“迷信”不能破除，思想不能解放，生产跃进的局面是不可能形成的。
    广大群众和干部朝气勃勃、多快好省地建设社会主义的精神和革命干劲，促进了我们思想的解放；1月、3月中央会议精神的深入学习使人们的思想更加振奋，过去不敢想、不敢做的事情，现在敢于大胆地想、大胆地干了。原来认为只能慢一点，少一点办的事，现在认识到可以快干大干了。这个时期，我们深刻地体会到“一天等于二十年”的伟大意义。已经解放了的生产力，只要把它引导到正确的方向，鼓足干劲，就能气壮山河，成为伟大的物质力量。正如中央所指出的：“社会生产力的发展要求社会主义革命，要求人们精神的解放；社会主义革命的胜利和人们精神的解放，又推动社会生产力的跃进；这种生产力的跃进，又继续刺激社会主义生产关系的改进和人们思想的前进”。一年以来经过的道路既从正面又从反面充分证明了这个论断的完全正确。
    继续跃进的关键
    在于迅速扩大耕地面积
    现在湖南工农业生产的大跃进，还只是一个开端。如何遵照总路线来加速建设，已经成为摆在我们面前的大问题。在发展工农业生产上，关于能不能跃进的问题，经过这一个时期的实践，特别是有了一九五六年和一九五八年的建设高潮与一九五七年反“冒进”的经验相比较，已经解决了。但是到底能跃多大多高，现在还是有争论的。有两种意见：一种是思想大解放，乘风破浪，力争上游，以更快的速度发展工农业生产，促使社会主义建设事业全面大跃进；一种是促而不进，有劲而劲不足，逡巡瞻顾，“渐进”而不敢“跃进”。两种思想代表着两类型的人：前者代表着坚持中央和毛泽东同志正确路线的广大群众和干部，后者代表着一小部分干部和群众。他们或者由于资产阶级思想影响还没有彻底肃清，或者由于精神没有解放，思想方法不对头，所以“见物不见人”，既看不见群众，实际上“物”也并不会真正看得清楚的。对于受着资产阶级思想影响的人，必须帮助他们彻底清除资产阶级的思想影响；对于思想还没有解放的人，必须帮助他们解放精神，解放思想。我们分析了各方面的条件，认为湖南已经有了大跃进的条件和可能。我们认为：我省农业发展十年规划的任务，有条件争取提前五年完成；地方工业总产值有条件在五年内赶上和超过农业总产值。以这样一个速度加速建设，就能够争取在五年或者稍多一点的时间内基本改变湖南的经济面貌。
    根据这样的设想，我们又重新考察和研究了我省的经济情况和自然情况。我省当前的基本情况是：耕地少，人口多，全省人口已经超过三千六百万，耕地只有五千八百万亩，每人平均只有一点六亩。粮食单位面积产量现在还不高。专用种植经济作物的面积只有三百五十万亩，仅占耕地总面积的百分之六。上年度生产实绩是：粮食在全部农副业总产值中占了百分之四十一点八，经济作物加上林木及油茶、油桐产值在农副业总产值中只占百分之七点六二；在工农业总产值中工业产值只占百分之二十一点零七。从这样几个比例和关系来看，现有粮食作物面积不能缩小，经济作物面积必须大大增加。否则人民收入和积累就不能迅速增长，工业发展的需要也不能得到满足。为了迅速改变这种情况，既保证粮食生产的不断增长，又大量的种植经济作物，使工农业生产获得飞跃的全面发展，关键问题在于迅速、大量地扩大耕地面积。
    在湖南究竟有没有扩大耕地面积的可能呢？我们认为是完全有可能的。全省的总面积是三亿零六百万亩，除现有的耕地、林地、宜林荒山、河湖水面、城市工矿、居民点和交通占地以外，还有六千多万亩可垦的荒山、荒洲。这些土地在小农经济时代是不可能开发利用的。现在全省已经实现了农业合作化，已经具备了大量垦荒的条件，只要依靠农业社的集体力量和国家的必要支持，就能够得到充分的利用。因此，我们计划在三、五年内全省扩大耕地面积二千万亩左右。现在全省已开荒一百多万亩。许多有开荒条件的农业社，现在正在有计划地组织开荒。全省今年预计可以再开垦五百万亩左右。平江县瓮江乡原有田土一万五千七百亩，过去两年开荒二千七百五十亩，并已经种上茶叶、平术、黄麻等经济作物，今年打算再开一千五百亩。洞庭湖一部分露出水面较高的荒洲，农业社已经在开垦，仅钱粮湖荒洲被农业社开垦的已达五万多亩。
    过去，我们所以没有或者不敢提出大量垦荒的问题，主要原因是我们思想没有解放，考虑问题有很大局限性，怕开荒引起水土流失，怕劳力不足，怕影响现有耕地产量，怕减少森林面积等。显然，这是一种消极的“现状维持派”的想法，结果就使思想被束缚在现有的耕地面积圈子之内，打不破圈子。当思想获得解放之后，眼界宽了，想的远了、大了，就敢于突破现有耕地面积的“圈子”了。我们认为：湖南应该采取大力提高单位面积产量与扩大耕地面积同时并举的方针，鼓足干劲，改造自然，向荒山荒洲进军，变荒山为梯土、梯田，变荒洲为良田。
    大规模地开荒会不会造成水土流失？现在看起来，问题不在于开不开荒，而看我们采取什么样的态度来对待自然。是采取只顾开荒不顾水土流失、只顾眼前不顾长远、掠夺自然的态度？还是采取充分地合理地利用自然资源、既开了荒又防治了水土流失的态度。我们坚决地否定了前一种态度，而采取了后一种态度。几年来的实践证明，在水土流失的地区，只是消极地去防治，不和积极地利用结合起来，是脱离群众、脱离实际的，是不能调动广大群众积极性的。凡是采取开荒与防治水土流失措施相结合的地方，因势利导，变害为利，就能够在更大的程度上把群众动员起来。另一方面，过去我们在水土流失严重的地区，只强调造林、绿化荒山，以防止水土流失，但因为和群众的眼前利益结合不起来，所以效果不好。现在许多农业社采取了粮、林（经济林）结合、经济作物上山、一年生作物和多年生作物结合、眼前利益和长远利益结合的办法，同时采取了工程措施（开坡土为梯土、改竖耕为横耕、修筑鱼鳞坑、防沙沟等）和生物措施（种植作物和造林），就大大刺激了群众的积极性，大大加快了治理水土流失的速度。有人耽心这样大规模的开荒会减少森林面积、降低复盖率，我们认为在现有的基础上在开荒的同时，动员群众大量造林，就可以使森林面积达到一亿五千八百万亩，复盖率将由现在的27％增加到50％。这样有控制的大量开荒是并不危险的，是有利而无害的。
    当我们完成了扩大二千万亩左右耕地任务之后，湖南将由现在的五千八百万亩耕地发展到七千八百万——八千万亩，耕地面积约等于一个日本。经济作物和饲料作物面积将由三百五十万亩扩大到一千八百万——二千万亩。这在湖南来说是一个生产上的大革命，它将促使工农业生产和经济、文化各方面的发展更加迅速。
    增加耕地面积后，我们就能够比较彻底地解决粮食与经济作物争地的矛盾；就可以充分利用现有粮食作物面积，从各方面努力提高单位面积产量，保证粮食生产计划的实现。经济作物面积的扩大，就能够扩大棉花、苎麻、糖料、油料等作物，来保证工业原料的供应，进一步推动工业的发展。饲料基地的扩大，就能够保证畜牧业，尤其是牲猪的大量发展。再加上山区经济林木的发展，这样，我们就有可能更快地增加积累、发展重工业和轻工业，工业的发展，反过来又能有力地支援农业。工农业生产的发展，必然加速文化革命、技术革命的进程。这就使我们能够抓住开荒和农业生产大跃进推动社会主义建设事业的全面大跃进。
    湖南和全国各地一样，有着丰富的自然资源，亟待我们去开发。伟大的中国人民，蕴藏着无限丰富的创造力。我们坚决相信，只要加强党的领导，紧密依靠群众，放手发动群众，贯彻执行党中央和毛泽东同志所规定的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，就一定能够使人们的思想得到解放，发挥人民群众的无限创造力，迅速改变湖南和全国的面貌，就一定能够在十五年或者更短的时间内赶上和超过英国。
