Xinhua News Agency: The flags of clubs have been planted all over the mountainous areas of Zhuanghe County, Liaoning Province, which is full of undulating hills. All agricultural production teams here have established clubs, and each team has a reading group, a blackboard newspaper, a singing team, and an amateur literary creation group. Many production teams also have basketball and volleyball teams, amateur theater troupes, and libraries. A joyful scene of building a new socialist countryside has emerged throughout the county.

　　Zhuanghe County originally had more than 400 rural clubs and 250 rural amateur theater troupes. During the great leap forward in production throughout the county, members of agricultural cooperatives proposed to carry out cultural activities on construction sites and in the fields. In order to facilitate flexible cultural activities for cooperative members living scattered in the mountainous areas, the Zhuanghe County Committee of the Communist Party of China made a decision to have production and culture take off together, and to establish clubs in every team. From March 21st to now, more than 2,400 new clubs have been built in the rural areas of the county, 308 new amateur theater troupes have been built, and 1,025 newly formed amateur literary creation groups have also been established. Amateur cultural and recreational activities have become an indispensable part of the daily lives of cooperative members. In the evenings, socialist songs are heard everywhere in the villages, and accompanied by the sound of gongs and drums, the Yangko dance teams twist from the front of the village to the back.

    俱乐部旗帜插遍山区
    庄河农村出现一派欢乐景象
    新华社讯　在到处岗峦起伏的辽宁省庄河县，俱乐部的旗帜已经插遍了山区。这里所有的农业生产队都建立起俱乐部，队队都有读报组、黑板报、歌咏队和业余文艺创作组。许多生产队还有篮排球队、业余剧团和图书室等。全县出现了一派建设社会主义新农村的欢乐景象。
    庄河县原来就有四百多个农村俱乐部和二百五十个农村业余剧团。在全县生产大跃进中，农业社社员们纷纷提出要在工地和田间开展文化活动。中共庄河县委为了便于山区分散居住的社员们灵活地进行文化活动，作出了生产和文化展翅齐飞，队队建立俱乐部的决定。从3月21日到现在，全县农村新建的俱乐部就有二千四百多个，新建业余剧团三百零八个，新组成的业余文艺创作组也有一千零二十五个。业余文化娱乐活动已经成为社员们日常生活中不可缺少的东西。晚间，在各个村里，社会主义歌声四起，在锣鼓声中，秧歌队从村前扭到村后。
