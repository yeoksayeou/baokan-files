　　Leading the Masses by Going Among the Masses, Leading Production by Going into Production
　　Cadres at All Levels in Xinjiang Leave Their Offices
　　Urumqi Dispatch: The leadership style of cadres in various parts of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has undergone significant changes during the spring plowing season. County Party secretaries are taking the lead in cultivating experimental plots, and cadres are buying manure baskets and "kantu mans" (a type of agricultural tool), eating, living, and laboring alongside farmers, greatly boosting their enthusiasm for production.

　　Currently, leaders and cadres in various parts of the autonomous region have made specific plans for cultivating experimental plots, and the vast majority of county party secretaries have their own experimental plots. According to incomplete statistics from Bayingol Mongol Autonomous Prefecture and the counties of Barkol, Hami, Awat, Jimusar, Bachu, and Wensu, the area of ​​cadre experimental plots has reached more than 2,000 mu. Experimental plot projects include high-yield cultivation of various crops and experiments with various yield-increasing measures.

　　In some places, cultivating experimental plots has set an example for innovating cultivation techniques. Guan Lizhi, the Party Secretary of Moyu County, adopted the advanced small furrow irrigation method in his experimental plot, and the wheat seedlings grew very strong. He then organized directors of agricultural cooperatives and production team leaders from various places to visit the experimental plot and, through on-site debates, unanimously agreed that small furrow irrigation was better than flood irrigation. The directors of the agricultural cooperatives immediately promoted the small furrow irrigation method after returning.

　　Since the beginning of spring plowing, it has become a common practice for cadres in various places to leave their offices and go deep into the agricultural cooperatives to lead production.

　　到群众中领导群众　到生产中领导生产
    新疆各级干部走出办公室
    本报乌鲁木齐电　新疆维吾尔自治区各地干部的领导作风，在春耕中有了显著改变。县委书记带头种试验田，干部买粪筐买砍土镘（一种农具），和农民同吃、同住、同劳动，大大鼓舞了农民的生产热情。
    现在，自治区各地领导干部都作出了种试验田的具体规划，绝大部分县委书记都有了自己的试验田。据巴音郭楞蒙古族自治州和巴里坤、哈密、阿瓦提、吉木萨尔、巴楚、温宿等县不完全统计，干部试验田达到二千多亩。试验田项目包括各种作物的丰产和各种增产措施的实验。
    有些地方通过种试验田，为革新耕作技术树立了榜样。墨玉县委书记管立志由于在试验田里采用了先进小畦灌溉法，麦苗长得非常茁壮，于是他便组织各地农业社主任和生产队长到试验田里进行参观，并通过现场辩论，一致认为小畦灌溉比漫灌好。各农业社主任回去后便立即推广了小畦灌溉法。
    春耕开始以来，各地干部走出办公室，深入到农业社去领导生产已成为一种风气。
