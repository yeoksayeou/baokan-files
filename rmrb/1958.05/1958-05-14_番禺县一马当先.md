People's Daily, Guangzhou, 13th – Panyu County is stepping up its efforts to achieve biogasification. To date, nearly one hundred biogas power stations have been built throughout the county, with others under construction. It is expected that by June, all 236 agricultural cooperatives in the county will have biogas power stations.

The biogas power stations that have already been built have played a good role in agricultural production and the development of local industry. The power stations in agricultural cooperatives are generally ten horsepower and are used for making fertilizers, processing agricultural products, and lighting. The Shiqiao Town in this county recently built a biogas power station with more than a dozen manure storage tanks. The power generation is three times more than the original local power plant, which can meet the needs of local industry for power.

The biogas power stations in agricultural cooperatives are mostly built using waste materials and self-reliance, equipped with engines and wires, etc., so the cost is low. Before building biogas power stations, the agricultural cooperatives all send members to visit and learn from other places, and after a short period of experimentation, they can independently master the technology of building biogas power stations.

The construction of biogas power stations in Panyu County has received the help and care of relevant departments. Representatives who attended the Guangdong Science Conference recently discovered some problems with biogas power stations during the visit, such as how to ensure continuous power generation and the selection and matching of machines. The relevant experts proposed to solve the problems on the spot. Now, Kang Xinyuan, director of the Department of Chemical Engineering of South China Institute of Technology, as well as professors from the Department of Civil Engineering and the Department of Mechanical Engineering, a group of fourteen people, have gone to Panyu to conduct on-site research and strive to solve the problems in the shortest possible time.

　　番禺县一马当先
    本报广州13日电　番禺县正在加紧实现沼气化。到目前为止，全县已经建成近一百个沼气动力站，还有一部分正在建设中。预计6月份可以作到全县二百三十六个农业社，社社都有沼气动力站。
    已经建成的沼气动力站对农业生产和发展地方工业已经起到很好的作用。农业社的动力站一般是十马力的，它们的用途是制肥料、加工农产品和照明。这个县的市桥镇最近建成了一个有十多个储粪池的沼气发电站，发电量比当地原有电厂的电力还多三倍，可以满足地方工业对动力的需要。
    农业社的沼气动力站大多利用废旧材料和自出劳力建成，再配备发动机和电线等，因此成本较低。各农业社在建沼气动力站前，都先派出社员到别处参观学习，再经过短期试验就能够独立掌握建造沼气动力站的技术。
    番禺县建设沼气动力站，得到有关部门的帮助和关怀。不久前参加广东科学会议的代表们在参观中发现沼气动力站的一些问题，如怎样保证连续发电及机器的选择和配合等。有关的专家当场提出保证解决。现在华南工学院化工系主任康辛元以及土木系、机械系的教授等一行十四人，已经前往番禺就地研究，争取在最短期内解决。　（赵颖）
