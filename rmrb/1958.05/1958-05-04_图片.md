    The Anhui Provincial Women's Federation held a hands-on tea picking on-site meeting at the Guanghui Agricultural Cooperative in Qimen County in late April, where production increases year after year. The main advantage of picking tea with both hands is its speed; one person can do the work of two.
    The picture shows Hu Fuzhi (center front), a first-class model of tea picking with both hands in Anhui Province and a member of the Shiji Agricultural Cooperative in Likou Township, Qimen County, introducing her experience and methods of picking tea with both hands to the representatives.
