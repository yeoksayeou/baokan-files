    The Lebanese People Rise Up
    Commentator of this newspaper
    A few days ago, at the call of the Lebanese National Front and other opposition parties, residents of Tripoli and Beirut first held a general strike and a general market strike. Subsequently, fierce mass resistance struggles spread throughout the country. Demonstrators chanted slogans such as "Down with the Eisenhower Doctrine" and angrily burned down the United States Information Service in Tripoli and the United States Information Service Library in Beirut. On May 13, the people of Beirut held another demonstration in front of the American Embassy. At the same time, in northern Lebanon, the oil pipelines of the Iraq Petroleum Company, mainly controlled by American and British capital, have been sabotaged.
    What does the current situation in Lebanon illustrate? First of all, it shows that the Lebanese people hate imperialism, especially American imperialism, to the core. Lebanon is a new country that gained independence during World War II, but for many years, imperialism has never relaxed its aggression and interference in Lebanon, and they have regarded Lebanon as an object of mutual contention. As early as 1951, the United States used the "Point Four Program" to further invade Lebanon, and then signed a so-called "aid" agreement with Lebanon, strengthening its control over Lebanon. Last spring, the United States, through its agents in Lebanon, imposed the colonialist shackles of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" on the Lebanese people. The United States has turned Lebanon's ports and airports into its military bases and Lebanon's territory into a stronghold for carrying out various conspiracies in the Near and Middle East. At the same time, the United States has also been trying to further pull Lebanon into Western military blocs and use Lebanon to undermine the unity of the Arab peoples. All these cannot but damage Lebanon's national sovereignty and national interests, making Lebanon's situation increasingly worse. Every patriotic Lebanese person strongly feels that if the imperialist forces are allowed to run rampant in Lebanon in this way, then the national destiny of Lebanon will be unimaginable. Therefore, they resolutely oppose the "Eisenhower Doctrine" and demand a change in the pro-Western policy of the Lebanese ruling group. These calls have long resonated throughout Lebanon.
    However, in recent months, imperialism has intensified its intervention in Lebanon. The Lebanese ruling group continues to pursue policies that serve imperialism and attempts to consolidate its position by amending the constitution. Therefore, the Lebanese people's struggle against the "Eisenhower Doctrine" is combined with the struggle against the ruling group that succumbs to the United States. The Lebanese people's patriotic struggle has declared the bankruptcy of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" in Lebanon and brought a major blow to the imperialist forces of aggression in Lebanon.
    The struggle of the Lebanese people has alarmed the United States. The U.S. State Department hurriedly issued a statement on May 12, expressing "regret" over the situation in Lebanon and openly slandering the demonstrating masses in Lebanon as "thugs and looters." These gentlemen in Washington are trying to put on the stinking airs of imperialism to scare the Lebanese people. However, the State Department should be told that this kind of shouting cannot scare anyone. Who are the "thugs and looters"? The United States uses the "big stick" of the "Eisenhower Doctrine" to break into other people's countries and plunder their resources. This is the real thug and looter. It is not the United States that has the right to express regret, but the Lebanese people!
    The United States is not just shouting. It is also preparing to create excuses to intervene in the situation in Lebanon in a more brutal way. On May 13, Lebanese President Chamoun hurriedly held a meeting with the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and France in Beirut. United Press International revealed that the meeting was to prepare for Lebanon to request foreign "aid." United Press International also deliberately trumpeted that the "crisis" in Lebanon would develop into an "international issue." At the same time, Western news agencies also reported, not accidentally, that two U.S. warships were conducting "Eastern countries patrols" in "waters within range of Lebanese territorial waters." These conspiracies of the United States deserve the vigilance of the Lebanese people. However, as long as all patriotic forces in Lebanon strengthen their unity and persist in their struggle, then no imperialism is to be feared, and any imperialist intervention can be defeated.

　　黎巴嫩人民行动起来了
　　本报评论员
    几天以前，在黎巴嫩民族阵线和其他反对党的号召下，的黎波里和贝鲁特居民首先举行了总罢工和总罢市。接着，激烈的群众反抗斗争就蔓延到全国各地。示威者高呼“打倒艾森豪威尔主义”的口号，并且愤怒地烧毁了的黎波里的美国新闻处和贝鲁特的美国新闻处图书馆。5月13日，贝鲁特人民又在美国大使馆前举行了示威。同时，在黎巴嫩北部地区，主要由美英资本控制的伊拉克石油公司的输油管已被破坏。
    黎巴嫩目前的局势说明了什么呢？它首先说明黎巴嫩人民对帝国主义，特别对美帝国主义是恨透了。黎巴嫩是第二次世界大战期间独立的新国家，但是多年以来，帝国主义从没有放松过对黎巴嫩的侵略和干涉，他们并且把黎巴嫩作为互相争夺的对象。还在1951年的时候，美国就利用“第四点计划”进一步侵入黎巴嫩，接着又同黎巴嫩订立了所谓“援助”协定，加强了对黎巴嫩的控制。去年春天，美国更通过它在黎巴嫩的代理人，把殖民主义的枷锁“艾森豪威尔主义”加到黎巴嫩人民的头上。美国把黎巴嫩的港口和机场变为它的军事基地，把黎巴嫩的国土变为它在中近东进行种种阴谋活动的一个据点。同时，美国还一直想把黎巴嫩进一步拉入西方军事集团，并利用黎巴嫩来破坏阿拉伯各国人民的团结。所有这些不能不使黎巴嫩的国家主权和民族利益遭受损害，使黎巴嫩的处境越来越恶化。每一个爱国的黎巴嫩人都强烈地感到，如果让帝国主义势力在黎巴嫩这样横行下去，那么黎巴嫩的民族命运将是不堪设想的。因此，他们坚决反对“艾森豪威尔主义”，并要求改变黎巴嫩统治集团的亲西方政策，这些呼声早就响彻黎巴嫩全国了。
    但是，近几个月来，帝国主义在黎巴嫩加紧了干涉活动。黎巴嫩统治集团继续推行为帝国主义服务的政策，还企图通过修改宪法，以达到巩固其地位的目的。因此，黎巴嫩人民反对“艾森豪威尔主义”的斗争同反对屈从美国的统治集团的斗争就结合在一起了。黎巴嫩人民的爱国斗争，宣布了“艾森豪威尔主义”在黎巴嫩的破产，并给帝国主义在黎巴嫩的侵略势力带来重大的打击。
    黎巴嫩人民的斗争，已经使美国恐慌起来。美国国务院于5月12日匆匆发表声明，对黎巴嫩的局势表示“遗憾”，并公然污蔑黎巴嫩的示威群众是“暴徒抢劫”。这些华盛顿的老爷们，企图摆出一付帝国主义的臭架子，来吓唬黎巴嫩人民。但是，应该告诉美国国务院，这种叫喊是吓唬不了什么人的。究竟谁是“暴徒抢劫”？美国使用“艾森豪威尔主义”的“大棒子”，闯进别人的国家，掠夺别人的资源，这才是真正的暴徒抢劫。有权利表示遗憾的不是美国，而是黎巴嫩人民！
    美国不仅是叫喊一下而已。它还正在准备制造借口，用更粗暴的方式干涉黎巴嫩的局势。5月13日，黎巴嫩总统夏蒙同美英法三国驻贝鲁特大使匆匆举行了会议。合众社透露，这次会议是为了黎巴嫩要求外国“援助”作好准备。合众社并且故意宣扬，说什么黎巴嫩的“危机”将要发展成为“国际问题”。同时，西方通讯社也并非偶然地报道说：两艘美国军舰正在“射程可以够到黎巴嫩领海的海面上”进行“东方诸国巡逻”。美国的这些阴谋活动，是值得黎巴嫩人民警惕的。但是，只要黎巴嫩一切爱国力量加强团结，坚持斗争，那么任何帝国主义都是不可怕的，任何帝国主义的干涉也都是可以打败的。
