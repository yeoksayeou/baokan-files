Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 17th: Since the beginning of summer, the Guangzhou market has been stable and prosperous. April, traditionally a slow season for business, saw an increase in market sales compared to March. Sales of consumer goods increased by 18.91% compared to March, and the turnover of the catering service industry increased by 6.4% compared to March. The basic disappearance of certain false purchasing power and extravagant consumption, and the steady improvement of the normal cultural and material life needs of the broad masses of people, are one of the characteristics of the Guangzhou market in early summer this year. At present, the sales of daily necessities such as undershirts, vests, towels, soap, and toilet soap are rising normally. The sales of these commodities in April increased by more than 25% compared to March.

Due to the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the active improvement of operation and management by state-owned commercial departments in Guangzhou, the supply of goods in the Guangzhou market this summer is particularly abundant. Not only are the retail stores of general merchandise, textiles, shoes, and hats full of goods, but the fruit and cold drink stalls on the streets have a wide variety and sufficient supply. The city's original ice rooms will add a considerable number of mobile cold drink supply stations, and more than one hundred sweet shops will also increase the supply of cold drinks. Many stores have also generally added special counters and retail stalls for seasonal goods. Some high-end commodities have also seen an increase in sales due to relatively abundant supply and increased variety. Among them, the retail sales of sewing machines, radios, table clocks, and watches in April increased by more than 50% compared to the same period last year.

Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 17th: In the early summer Chongqing market, a situation of a hundred products competing at the same time has emerged.

In the central store of Chongqing Department Store Company, a batch of new-patterned products has recently been put on trial sale. Shanghai-shipped women's short-sleeved shirts for trial sale were very popular among young women, and were completely sold out in just over an hour on the shelves. A new type of women's sportswear produced in Chongqing was also snapped up by customers, and the salesperson had to reorder from the factory. Salespersons at the department store center pre-announced to customers: before "June 1st" Children's Day, they will have dozens of new patterns of children's clothing on the market.

This year, various cloth shops in the city center have added more than 470 kinds of cotton cloth and silk with various new patterns and varieties. The supply of variegated khaki, variegated seersucker, and plain-colored fine silk, which were in short supply in previous years, has increased this year.

In the great leap forward in commerce, retail stores in Chongqing City have implemented a system of combining purchasing and sales. Many salespersons personally go to the wholesale department to select goods, making the goods sold in the store more in line with customer needs.

　　广州市场入夏平稳发展
    重庆百家产品同时媲美
    新华社广州17日电　入夏以来，广州市场平稳繁荣。一向是商业淡季的4月份，市场销量反而比3月份增加。其中生活资料的销售总额比3月份增加18.91％，饮食服务业的营业额比3月份增加6.4％。某些虚假购买力和浮华奢侈的消费基本消失，广大人民正常的文化物质生活需要在稳定地提高，这是今年广州市初夏市场的特点之一。目前人民日常生活必需的汗衫、背心、毛巾、肥皂、香皂等商品的销量，正在正常地上升。这些商品4月份的销售额都比3月份增加25％以上。
    由于工农业生产大跃进和广州市国营商业部门积极改进经营管理，今年夏季广州市场的货源显得特别充沛，不仅百货、纺织品、鞋帽等零售店商品琳琅满目，街头上的水果、冷饮摊店更是品种繁多，供应充足。全市原有的冰室将要增设相当数量的流动冷饮供应站，一百多家甜食店也增加供应冷饮。许多商店还普遍增设了适令商品的专柜、零售摊。某些高级商品由于货源比较充足和品种增多，销售量也有增加。其中缝纫机、收音机、台钟、手表等4月的零售额，都比去年同期增加50％以上。
    新华社重庆17日电　初夏的重庆市场，出现百家产品同时媲美的局面。
    在重庆市百货公司中心商店里，最近试销一批新花色的产品。上海运来试销的女短袖衫，很受年轻姑娘的欢迎，放上货架只一小时多全部销光。重庆新生产的一种女运动衫也被顾客争购一空，售货员不得不再向工厂订货。百货中心商店售货员向顾客预告：在“六一”儿童节前，他们将有几十个新花色的童装应市。
    今年市中心区各家布店增添各种新花色品种的棉布、丝绸有四百七十多种，往年供应较少的杂色卡其、杂色泡泡纱、素色碧绸，今年的供应数量都增大了。
    在商业大跃进中，重庆市的零售商店实行了进货、销货合一的制度，许多售货员都亲自到批发部门选购商品，使商店出售的商品更合顾客需要。
