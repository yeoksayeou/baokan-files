　　This newspaper, Chongqing, May 14th (Reporter Hu Mingjun) reports: In order to rapidly provide a large amount of diverse mineral resources for the development of local industry, the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau is strengthening the general survey and inspection work of more than two thousand mass ore reporting points in many regions and counties within the Sichuan Basin; and is providing a large amount of assistance and close cooperation to the specialized county local industrial departments in terms of prospecting technology and work.

    In accordance with the central government's policy of simultaneously developing central and local industries, the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau has changed its past practice of only searching for large mines and not paying attention to searching for medium and small mines this year. In the Great Leap Forward, in addition to ensuring the over-fulfillment of the general survey and exploration of large mines needed by the state, the entire bureau has also made new arrangements in terms of prospecting areas, working methods, and technical forces, so as to find thousands of medium and small mines in a few years to meet the needs of local industrial development. In terms of prospecting areas, in addition to continuing to prospect for mines on the edge of the Sichuan Basin, a considerable technical force has been newly organized to conduct general prospecting in many counties in various regions within the Sichuan Basin. The prospecting method has also changed from mostly searching for a single type of mineral in the past to conducting comprehensive surveys of various minerals in the region. The bureau has organized six comprehensive prospecting teams in northwestern Sichuan, eastern Sichuan, southern Sichuan, and other places, and is actively carrying out work. The teams first started by inspecting the more than two thousand mineral deposit reports from the masses, making evaluations, and strengthening inspections of new mineral deposits found in the regional comprehensive survey work and making evaluations in a timely manner. After the general survey of medium-sized deposits, exploration will also be carried out to obtain reserves, which will then be handed over to the local industrial departments. Some teams in the bureau have also taken the initiative to solicit local requirements for mineral resources, and specially sent technical forces to help with the work, so as to fully meet the needs of local industry in the team's location.

    In view of the fact that many regions and counties are going to establish geological institutions or geological teams, the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau is also actively supporting the regions and counties technically and in their work, and is strengthening cooperation with them. The bureau has transferred a group of technicians to work in the regions and counties to strengthen the geological technical force in the regions and counties; at the same time, it is actively helping the regions to train technical forces. Recently, in addition to sending technicians to assist in teaching work in the newly established training courses in the province to train local geological talents, it has also absorbed a group of people sent by the regions and counties for training. For example, eleven counties including Dazhu, Linshui, Dazhu, and Qu County in Dazhou Region have sent people to come, and the bureau has assigned them to eleven field teams to learn about diverse prospecting work, and signed master-apprentice contracts with the team technicians to learn the basic knowledge and technology of prospecting and exploration in about a year. In order to strengthen cooperation with the regions, the field teams of the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau also help the regions and counties on the spot to solve problems in their prospecting work and technical problems; and promptly send relevant documents on new methods, new knowledge, and work experience in geology, exploration, and testing to local industrial departments. The Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau also contracts the ore sample testing work of the regions and counties. The ore samples discovered by the regions and counties are handed over to the testing group of the field team sent by the bureau to the local area or to the bureau's laboratory for testing.

　　四川省地质工作确定了新方针
　　为地方工业提供多种资源
    本报重庆14日电　记者胡明俊报道：为了给地方工业的发展迅速提供大量的多种多样的矿产资源，四川省地质局正在四川盆地内部许多专区和县加强两千多个群众报矿点的普查和检查工作；并对专县地方工业部门在找矿的技术上、工作上给以大量援助和密切协作。
    根据中央工业和地方工业同时并举的方针，四川省地质局今年改变了过去只找大矿不注意找中、小型矿的做法。全局在大跃进中，除了保证大大超额完成普查和勘探国家需要的大矿外，还在找矿地区、工作方法和技术力量等方面作了新的布置，以便在几年内寻找几千个中、小型矿，来满足地方工业发展的需要。在找矿地区上，除了继续在四川盆地边缘找矿外，还新组织了相当大的技术力量在四川盆地内部各个专区许多县进行普查找矿。找矿方法也由过去大多只找单一的矿种，改变为进行地区的各种矿产的综合普查。这个局已经组织了在川西北、川东、川南等地找矿的六个综合普查队，正积极开展工作。各队首先着手检查群众报告的两千多个矿点，作出评价，并对区域综合普查工作中所发现的新矿点，及时加强检查作出评价。对中型矿床普查以后，还要进行勘探，求得储量，然后交给地方工业部门。这个局有的队还主动征求地方对矿产资源的要求，专门派技术力量帮助工作，以充分满足队所在地地方工业的需要。
    鉴于许多专区和县都要成立地质机构或地质队，四川省地质局还在技术上、工作上积极支援专县，并与专县加强协作。这个局已调出一批技术人员到专县去工作，加强专县地质技术力量；同时积极帮助专区培养技术力量。最近除了派技术人员到省内新办的培养地方地质人材的训练班协助进行教学工作外，还吸收了一批专县派来的人员进行培养。如达县专区的达县、邻水、大竹、渠县等十一个县都已派人前来，该局已将他们分配到十一个野外队学习多种多样的找矿工作，和各队技术人员订立师徒合同，在一年左右学会找矿、探矿的基本知识和技术。为了加强与专区的协作，四川省地质局各野外队还就地帮助专县解决找矿的工作上和技术上的问题；及时将地质、勘探、化验等工作方面有关的新方法、新知识和工作经验等文件发给地方工业部门。四川省地质局并包干专县的矿石样品化验工作，专县发现的矿石样品，都交给局里派到当地的野外队化验组或交到局的化验室进行化验。
