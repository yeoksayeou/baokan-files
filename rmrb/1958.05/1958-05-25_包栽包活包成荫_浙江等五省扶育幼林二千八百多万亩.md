Xinhua News Agency, May 24th – Building upon the tremendous achievements in spring afforestation, various localities are vigorously carrying out the nurturing and management of young forests. By mid-May, statistics from Zhejiang, Hunan, Guizhou, Anhui, and Fujian provinces alone show that they have nurtured 28,855,930 mu of young forests, accounting for 20%-30% of the area afforested this spring in these provinces.

After the conclusion of spring afforestation, Hebei, Guizhou, Anhui, Hunan, and other regions universally organized mass appraisal and inspection campaigns. In conjunction with these inspections, saplings that did not meet standards or were unlikely to survive were promptly replanted, earthed up, and watered. In the management of young forests, most areas have implemented the "Five Guarantees" system (guaranteed planting, guaranteed survival, guaranteed nurturing, guaranteed protection, and guaranteed growth). Many special districts and counties have issued proclamations protecting young forests and mobilized townships and communes to establish forest protection organizations. In the past, the survival rate of trees planted along roadsides in Fuyang Special District, Anhui, was very low, and "trees were planted every year, but no shade was ever seen." This year, areas where saplings have been planted are divided into sections, ensuring that "every section is managed by someone, and every tree is watched over by someone," resulting in a survival rate of over 90%.

Appointing dedicated personnel or establishing forestry professional teams to nurture and manage young forests has become the main method for carrying out this work in various localities. Hunan Province, relying on 45,000 professional teams, has nurtured 6.5 million mu of young forests and intercropped 850,000 mu with grain crops in the past month. Young forests that have been nurtured can generally maintain a survival rate of over 85%.

Recently, many agricultural cooperatives in mountainous areas of Hubei, Guangdong, Hebei, Henan, Hunan, and other provinces have also established more than 1,400 cooperative-run or joint cooperative-run forest farms on the basis of professional teams, in order to systematically nurture and manage young forests, tap the potential of barren mountains, and rapidly develop mountainous areas.

    包栽包活包成荫
    浙江等五省扶育幼林二千八百多万亩
    新华社24日讯　各地在春季造林取得巨大成绩的基础上，正在大力开展幼林的扶育和管理活动。到5月中旬止，仅据浙江、湖南、贵州、安徽、福建等五省的统计，就已扶育幼林二千八百五十五万九千三百九十亩，分别占到这些省今春造林面积的20％—30％。
    河北、贵州、安徽、湖南等地区在春季造林结束以后，普遍组织群众性的评比检查，结合检查，对不合规格的或不能成活的幼树及时进行了补植、培土和浇水。在幼林的管理上，一般地区都实行了五包（包栽、包活、包扶育、包保护、包长大）办法，不少专区、县颁发了保护幼林的布告，发动乡、社建立护林组织。安徽阜阳专区以往公路两旁栽的树成活率很低，“年年栽树不见成荫”；今年栽幼树的地方都划片分段，做到“段段有人管，树树有人看”，使成活率达90％以上。
    固定专人或建立林业专业队来扶育管理幼林，已成为各地进行这项工作的主要办法。湖南省依靠四万五千个专业队，一个月来扶育了六百五十万亩幼林，并间种粮食作物八十五万亩。经过扶育的幼林，一般可以把成活率保持在85％以上。
    最近湖北、广东、河北、河南、湖南等省许多山区的农业社，还在专业队的基础上，建立起社办或联社办的林场一千四百多个，以便有计划地扶育管理幼林，挖掘荒山的潜在力量，迅速建设山区。
