Xinhua News Agency, May 21st, Kharkov dispatch: "Flat plazas suitable for spacecraft landing may exist on the surface of the moon," said Professor Barabashov, a famous Soviet astrophysicist and chairman of the Planetary Committee of the Astronomical Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, to a TASS reporter.

    He emphasized that at present, when interplanetary travel is becoming a problem of the near future, solving the problem of the lunar surface topography and determining the exact "address" of spacecraft landing sites is already of practical significance.

    He said that scientists, in studying new materials about the light reflection properties of the lunar surface, came to the conclusion that there may be large or small flat plazas on the moon.

    The latest materials obtained in the study of the moon prove that a considerable part of the lunar surface is covered with a layer of volcanic ash and lava products. This is the result of the "rain" of meteorites that often fall on the moon. When meteorites hit the lunar surface, they become incandescent and melt, and at the same time melt the surface rocks of the moon.

    Some parts of the lunar surface are apparently covered with large rocks, which are formed by the cracking of rocks under drastic temperature changes. On the moon, the daytime temperature is as high as 120 degrees Celsius, and the nighttime temperature is as low as minus 200 degrees Celsius.

    These issues are currently being discussed at the meeting of the Lunar and Planetary Physical Conditions Research Committee of the Astronomical Council of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, which opened in Kharkov on the 20th. This meeting will also discuss other extremely important issues related to the moon and the planets of the solar system. Some of the most famous astronomers, astrophysicists, and astrobotanists from various Soviet republics are participating in the meeting.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 21st: Valvarov, director of the Cosmonautics Department of the Soviet Voluntary Association for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force, recently wrote in "Komsomolskaya Pravda" that calculations show that it is realistically possible for a multi-stage rocket carrying a thousand kilograms of effective payload (referring to various equipment for scientific exploration) to reach the moon.

    The entire initial weight of this type of multi-stage rocket using thermochemical fuel is one thousand tons. If the jet velocity is increased, the initial weight can be greatly reduced while maintaining the same effective payload. This problem is currently being solved smoothly, so there is every reason to believe that with the development of rocket technology, the task of flying to the moon and conducting major scientific explorations after reaching the moon can be achieved in the near future. This rocket leaves the Earth at a speed of 40,000 kilometers per hour and can reach the moon in 115 hours.

    Valvarov pointed out that although the Soviet Union is currently able to send a few kilograms of effective payload to the moon, the scientific significance of such experiments is not great because such rockets cannot carry the instruments necessary for scientific exploration.

    The author finally emphasized that to solve the problem of interplanetary travel, the basic method that cosmonauts should adopt is to build artificial satellites with huge weight. It is impossible to solve the problem of interplanetary travel with extremely small satellites like those that the United States has launched or plans to launch in the near future.

### 访问月宫前  先找着陆点  苏联科学家认为那里有平坦广场发射大火箭到月球已有现实可能

    访问月宫前  先找着陆点
    苏联科学家认为那里有平坦广场发射大火箭到月球已有现实可能
    新华社21日讯　据塔斯社哈尔科夫讯：“在月球表面上可能存在适合宇宙飞船着陆的平坦广场”，这是苏联著名天体物理学家、苏联科学院天文学委员会行星委员会主席巴拉巴绍夫教授对塔斯社记者说的。
    他着重指出，目前，当行星际交通成为不久的未来的问题的时候，解决有关月球表面地形和确定宇宙飞船着陆场的准确“地址”，已经具有实践意义。
    他说，科学家们在研究关于月球表面光线反射性质的新材料的时候，得出了月球上可能有或大或小的平坦广场的结论。
    在研究月球方面获得的最新材料证明，月球表面相当大一部分盖着一层火山灰和熔岩产物。这是常常落到月球上的陨星“雨”的后果。在撞击到月球表面的时候，陨星炽热熔化，同时也使月球表层岩石熔化了。
    月球表面的某些部分显然覆盖着大石块，这些石块是岩石在温度激烈变化情况下裂开而成的。在月球上，白昼温度高达摄氏一百二十度，夜间低到零下二百度。
    这些问题目前正在20日于哈尔科夫开幕的苏联科学院天文学委员会月亮和行星物理条件研究委员会会议上讨论。这个会议还要讨论有关月球和太阳系行星的其它一些极重要的问题。苏联各共和国一些极著名的天文学家、天体物理学家和天文植物学家都参加了会议。
    新华社莫斯科21日电　苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会宇宙飞行部主任瓦尔瓦罗夫最近在“共青团真理报”上撰文说，计算表明，带有一千公斤有效载重（指进行科学考察的各种装备）的多级火箭到达月球，是具有现实可能的。
    这种使用热化学燃料的多级火箭整个初重为一千吨。如果使喷气速度增加，在保持同样有效载重的条件下，初重可以大大减少。目前这个问题正在顺利解决中，因此有一切理由认为，随着火箭技术的发展，飞到月球并在到达月球后进行重大科学考察的任务，在近几年就可以实现。这个火箭以每小时四万公里的速度离开地球，一百一十五小时后就可到达月球。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫指出，虽然苏联目前已经能把几公斤重的有效载重送上月球，但由于这种火箭不能装载科学考察所必须的仪器，这样实验的科学意义是不大的。
    作者最后强调指出，要解决行星际交通的问题，宇宙飞行家所应采用的基本方法，就是建造重量巨大的人造卫星。而用类似美国已经发射或计划在最近将来发射的那种极其微小的卫星，是无论如何也不能解决行星际交通的问题的。
