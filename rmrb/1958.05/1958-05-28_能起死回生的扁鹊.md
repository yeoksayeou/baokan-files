    Bian Que was a folk doctor during the Warring States period (around 500 BC), and a well-known and respected doctor at the time. He not only possessed excellent medical skills, but also a set of scientific medical theories. The four diagnostic methods of observation, auscultation, interrogation, and palpation were pioneered by him. These methods are still valued by doctors at home and abroad today.
    Bian Que once used pulse diagnosis to determine that Zhao Jianzi, who had been in a coma for five days, had not actually died. He also used acupuncture and moxibustion to resuscitate the seemingly dead person.
    At that time, Bian Que was already able to specialize in different departments, and in addition to internal medicine, he also diagnosed pediatrics, gynecology, and otolaryngology. He had the scientific idea that diseases develop from the inside out, advocating early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention, and opposed superstition. He once proposed six conditions for which treatment would be ineffective, the most incurable of which was "believing in witches rather than doctors."

    能起死回生的扁鹊
    扁鹊是战国时代（约公元前五百年）的民间医生，也是当时远近称道的名医。他不仅有很好的医疗技术，而且有一套科学的医学理论。望、闻、问、切四种诊断方法，就是他首创的。这种方法，直到今天还为中外医生重视。
    扁鹊曾用切脉的方法判断出已昏迷了五日的赵简子实际并没有死。他还用针灸和热敷的办法把假死的人救活过来。
    当时，扁鹊已能分科看病，除内科外，他还诊断过小儿科、妇科，耳目科。他具有病是从内到外发展、早期诊断、治疗、预防为主的科学的思想，反对迷信。他曾提出过六不治理论，其中最不可治的便是“信巫不信医”。
