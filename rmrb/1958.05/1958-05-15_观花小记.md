Random Notes on Flower Viewing
Xie Juezai

Comrade Xie Juezai recently inspected Shaanxi, Sichuan, and other places, and wrote some notes, some of which have already been published in the newspaper. There are a few more, and now with Old Xie's consent, they are published in the supplement. Old Xie said: I am just skimming the surface or perhaps just passing by without even seeing the flowers. Hence the title "Random Notes on Flower Viewing."

Visiting the Red Flag Commune and the July 1st Commune

In Xi'an, I went to see the Red Flag Agricultural Commune in the suburbs. It is a large commune with 1,600 households, more than 8,000 people, and about 14,000 mu of land. They have opened several canals—Happiness Canal, Peace Canal, Communist Youth Canal, and South Branch Canal. They call the river that has historically caused harm "harmful water," and now they have tamed it, diverting it into several canals according to the terrain, so that land with different slopes can be irrigated. Winter irrigation of wheat is now underway, and it is growing well. They have built terraces in high places, and several mountain gullies need dams. The commune director said, "We want to bring water up the mountains." He pointed and said, "We have planted many fruit trees, some of which will bear fruit in three or four years. With water and fertilizer, increased production is guaranteed. We estimate that last year each labor day was worth 1.5 yuan, and this year we expect to distribute 2.8 yuan. Last year, the average grain yield per mu was 295 jin, and this year we aim for 845 jin."

The commune director, Liu Zhongxiao, is an old farmer who says he has never traveled more than 200 li from his village, but he speaks clearly and confidently. I said, "You are already an intellectual."

I went to the July 1st Cooperative in Wangmang Township, Chang'an County. The cooperative director, Pu Zhongzhi, is a National People's Congress representative. The township has always done well in its work. The cooperative director said: This year, grain production will reach the Yangtze River, and next year it will cross the Yangtze River. The cooperative has a small hydropower station. I saw groups of women digging and carrying pond mud, including little girls and old ladies, who welcomed us with laughter.

At the Intermediate Party School, they asked us to write calligraphy on rice paper. I wrote a poem after seeing the Red Flag Commune and the July 1st Commune:

	Leaping forward, Red Flag Commune, heroic Wangmang Township.
	Canals crisscross like nets, new and old trees in rows.
	Industry and agriculture advance together, hands and minds busy.
	Asked about the bumper harvest, next year it will cross the Yangtze River.

I went to the Civil Affairs Department to see the big-character posters, which criticized the Ministry of Internal Affairs. I copied them and sent them back. I talked with Director Ren and recited a poem to him:

	Energy requires sufficient talent, people require less talent and diligence.
	The surface is the sum of points, condensation is the result of breadth.
	Hands, eyes, and brain all used, top, middle, and bottom all connected.
	Such workers, their oil is worth ten thousand gold.

Passing Through the Baoji-Chengdu Railway

Getting on the train to Chengdu, this is a great railway. I couldn't help but write a poem:

	Riding on the dragon of the train,
	Climbing up the cliffs of the Qinling Mountains;
	Turning several big bends and drilling through numerous tunnels,
	Leaving behind the vast Guanzhong Plain.

	The train dragon winding upwards
	And winding downwards again.

	Someone recited Li Bai's "The Road to Shu is Hard":
	"The yellow stork cannot fly up, the monkey is worried."
	Someone pointed out:
	"That small mountain like a steamed bun is where Ma Su lost Jieting;
	That classical pavilion is where Yang Xiong read books;"
	…………………
	…………………
	Historical sites are numerous! There is no time to watch, let alone study;
	The dangers have already been passed under the rumbling wheels.

	A train journey of more than twenty hours:
	On that side, eight hundred li of Qinchuan, the people are prosperous, the land is fertile;
	On this side, the Chengdu Plain, known as the Land of Abundance;
	On that side, the poplars have not yet sprouted, on this side, rapeseed flowers are yellow everywhere, and the magnolias in the park have already budded;
	On that side, the old man delivering manure is wearing a cotton coat, on this side, the young man drawing water is bare-armed: The surging tide of leaping forward production is booming everywhere.

Chengdu Scenery

I visited the South Suburb Park of Chengdu, which is composed of the Wuhou Temple and Liu Xiang's tomb. Wuhou (Zhuge Liang) and the Zhaolie Temple (Liu Bei) are one behind and one in front. There are many statues, almost all of the Shu figures in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. There are orchids with hanging eaves that do not need potting or watering, and they are very fragrant. There are many Ci bamboos, with dense shade blocking the sun. The cypress trees are taller than those in the north, with dense branches and leaves. Du Fu's poem "Cypresses are dense outside Jin Guan City," although they are not the cypresses of the Tang Dynasty, the word "dense" is just right. There are many couplets in the temple. Comrade Wu Yuzhang said: Sixty years ago, he saw a couplet in front of Zhaolie's tomb (the tomb is on the side of the temple) that is no longer there. Old Wu still remembers its words: "A mound of earth, still majestic, ask him where is the Copper Bird Terrace and the tomb of suspected Zhang River. A three-legged cauldron, where is it now, only this stone unicorn and ancient road remain, still reminiscent of the official manners of the Han Dynasty."

Liu Xiang was forced to death by Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang built an imperial-style tomb for him, which is much larger in scale than the Wuhou Temple and Liu Bei's tomb. Now the stele has been removed and the tomb has been leveled, but the reason for this has not been recorded, leaving visitors confused as to why there is such a formal park. I wrote a poem:

	Clumps of bamboo green like smoke, orchids hanging from the eaves. The ancient stele is a triple marvel (the Tang stele, Pei Du wrote the text, Liu Gongchuo wrote the characters, and Zhuge Liang's achievements, known as the triple marvel), cypresses towering to the sky. Zhaolie's tomb is desolate, spring passes again, (it is said that on the old lunar New Year's Day, you can enter the Zhaolie tomb wall to visit) remember the legacy couplet. It is another heaven, golden and bright. It is a mausoleum and not a mausoleum. The cause should be revealed, to distinguish between treacherous and virtuous.

I visited the Thatched Cottage Temple, the original site of Du Fu's Thatched Cottage by the Huanhua River. The scenery is very good. The comrades in charge of cultural relics here have collected many ancient versions of Du Fu's poems and foreign translations, portraits of Du Fu, and calligraphy and paintings related to Du Fu, including paintings by Qi Baishi and calligraphy by Guo Moruo. There are many couplets, including He Shaoji's "The spring breeze of Jinshui is occupied by you, I return to the Thatched Cottage on the day of Ren." The niche couplet is "You built a house by the desolate river for thousands of years, Song's two sages ascend the hall in different generations." Du Fu is worshipped on the left and right by Huang Tingjian and Lu You.

We also saw the Wangjiang Tower, Wang Jian's Tomb, Baoguang Temple, Daci Temple, Zhao Jue Temple and other historical sites, but only looked at them in general.

Chengdu has flowers in all seasons. Now is the season when crabapples, magnolias, and Bauhinia flowers are in full bloom. It is said that there are many kinds of hibiscus flowers, and the flowers are the best, so Chengdu is known as the City of Hibiscus. Sichuan cuisine is very good, and I have eaten too much several times. But Chengdu generally only calls it "snacks," which probably means "to know the taste."

Visiting the Happiness Commune

I went to the Happiness First Commune in Xipu Township, Pi County. The commune director said: Last year, the yield per mu reached more than 1,000 jin. In 1955, the average income per household was 383 yuan, in 1956 it was 441 yuan, and in 1957 it was 510 yuan. The average income per person in the commune was 110 yuan. The commune's public accumulation fund is 110,000 yuan. The savings of the commune members themselves are more than 60,000 yuan. There is a hydropower plant that mills rice during the day and provides lighting at night. The commune director said: Machine milling of rice has a high rice yield. A rice mill costs only a little over 1,000 yuan, which can be recovered in a few months. There are nine dairy cows that produce more than 60 jin of milk for children and the elderly to eat.

This year's plan is to produce 1,700 jin per mu and strive for 2,000 jin. The methods are: planting double-season rice and expanding the planting area.

This commune has 11 households of revolutionary martyrs and military families who receive preferential treatment, and 15 households who are guaranteed five aspects of life, and their grain and pocket money are the same as the commune members.

We visited several peasant households in Happiness First Commune. Commune member Huang Shaoming, a poor peasant, has a family of three, with five rooms, raising two piglets. In his private plot, there are peach, plum, and orange trees, and a grape trellis. The broad beans he planted are very lush. He has more than 20 chickens and ducks. Last year, he worked 160 labor days, with a value of 8 jiao per day. This year, the plan is for each labor day to be worth 1 yuan. His son works at the Pi County Department Store. The furniture and bedding in the house are complete.

Happiness First Commune is a medium-sized commune in Xipu Township.

Pi County Mayor Gao Weixi said: The county has 220,000 people and 370,000 mu of land, all irrigated by the Dujiangyan irrigation system. The water conservancy is good, and the climate is also good. Last year, the county was already a thousand-jin county, and this year the plan is to increase production by 25% and strive for 30%. The peasants are very motivated. This year, they plan to buy 100 tractors, increase by 50 next year, and increase by 100 the year after. The whole county will be mechanized. Funding is not a problem, as each cooperative has money. Electrification is also easy, but they are worried that generators will not be easy to buy. Technicians can be trained through short-term learning. They plan to build a fertilizer factory, mainly granular fertilizer. Seeds are a problem, such as potato seeds, local ones cannot be used and must be purchased and transported from mountainous areas.

There are 3,600 poor households in the county, accounting for 8% of the total number of households: one is a lack of labor, one is temporary difficulties due to natural disasters and man-made disasters, and one is lazy people who do not work hard. There are also those with a large population and little labor. They are resolved through methods such as supporting production, government relief, public welfare fund subsidies, and agricultural tax reductions. The 3,300 demobilized soldiers play a significant role in production, and many are also cadres. Last year, some people eagerly requested to get married and spent their money quickly. After education, they have improved somewhat. (To be continued)

　　观花小记
　　谢觉哉
    谢觉哉同志前不久到陕西、四川等处视察，写有笔记，有的已在报上发表。还有几则，现在征得谢老同意，在副刊发表。谢老说：我是走马观花或只是走马未观花。因以观花小记为题。
    ——编者
    歌红旗社和七一社
    到西安，去看郊区红旗农业社，是个大社，有一千六百多户，八千多人，约一万四千亩土地，他们开了几道渠——幸福渠、和平渠、共青渠、南分渠。他们叫历来为害的河是害水，现把它驯服了，按地势把它引到几条渠里，使坡度不同的地都可以灌到。现小麦已进行冬灌，长得颇好。高的地方修了梯田，有几条山沟要闸，社主任说：“我们要引水上山。”又指着说：“我们已栽了不少株果树，有的三四年就可结果子。有了水，有了肥料，增产就有了保证。我们计算：去年每个劳动工值一元五角，今年预计分二元八角，去年每亩平均产粮二百九十五斤，今年要求产八百四十五斤。”
    社主任刘忠孝是老农，说他没有走出乡二百华里，但说话有条理，有把握。我说：“你已经是个知识分子了。”
    去长安县王莽乡的七一合作社，社主任蒲忠智是全国人大代表，该乡历来工作很好，社主任说：今年粮产要到长江边，明年跨过长江。该社有小水电站。看到成群的妇女在挖挑塘泥，有小女孩、有老太太，他们欢笑地欢迎我们。
    到中级党校，他们拿宣纸要我们写字，我写了看红旗社和七一社的诗：
    跃进红旗社，英雄王莽乡。
    纵横渠若网，新老树成行。
    并举工农竞，交叉手脑忙。
    问他丰产量，明岁过长江。
    去民政厅看大字报，有批评内务部的，抄上寄回。与任厅长谈话，念了一首诗给他：
    劲要干才足，人要少才勤。
    面为点之积，约是博之功。
    手眼脑俱用，上中下齐通。
    如斯工作者，油才够万金。
    过宝成路
    登车去成都，这是一条伟大的铁路，情不自禁地写了一首诗：
    跨上火车的龙，
    扒上秦岭的壁；
    转几个大弯子钻若干个洞，
    把莽莽的关中平原抛在后面。
    蜿蜒地上升的火车龙
    又蜿蜒地降落。
    有人背诵李白的蜀道难说：
    黄鹄飞不上，猴子发了愁。
    有人指点：
    那个像窝窝头的小山，马谡在那里失去了街亭；
    这个古典式的亭子，扬子云在里面读过书；
　　…………………
　　…………………
    古迹呢，多得很！来不及观看更说不上考究；
    奇险呢，已经在轰隆轰隆的轮子下滑过。
    二十多个小时的车程：
    那边厢，八百里秦川，民殷物阜，
    这边厢，成都坝子，号称天府；那边厢，杨树尚未绽芽，这边厢，油菜花遍野黄，公园里的玉兰花已经抽了花朵；那边厢，送粪的老太爷披着棉衣，这边厢，车水的小伙子光着臂膊：跃进又跃进的生产潮，到处都如鼎沸。
    成都风光
    游成都南郊公园，公园由武侯祠与刘湘坆两部分合成。武侯与昭烈庙一在后进一在前进，塑有很多像，差不多三国演义上蜀的人都有。有悬檐的兰花，不要盆栽浇水，很香；有很多慈竹，浓阴蔽日；柏树比北方的高，枝叶密茂，杜甫诗“锦官城外柏森森”，虽然现已不是唐时的柏了，但森森二字用的恰好。庙多楹联，吴玉章同志说：六十年前看到昭烈墓前一联
  （墓在庙侧）今不见了。吴老犹记其词：“一坏土，尚巍然，问他铜雀荒台，何处寻漳河疑冢。三足鼎，今安在，剩此石麟古道，犹想见汉代官仪。”
    刘湘被蒋介石逼死，蒋为修一皇帝式的墓，规模比武侯祠刘备墓大得多，今碑已去，坟已平，但未记其事由，使游者不解何以有这样形式的公园。我写了一首词：
    丛竹绿如烟，兰挂檐前。古碑三绝（唐碑一、裴度撰文、柳公绰书字、和诸葛亮的工绩，称三绝）柏参天。昭烈墓荒春又过，（传旧历元旦可进昭烈墓围墙参观）记取遗联。又是一重天，金碧鲜妍。是陵园又匪陵园。应把事由昭示出，好辨奸贤。
    游草堂寺即杜甫浣花草堂原址，风景很好。这里管文物的同志搜集了很多杜诗古本和外国译本，杜甫遗像以及有关杜甫的字画，有齐白石的画和郭沫若的字。楹联甚多，有何绍基的“锦水春风公占却，草堂人日我归来”。龛联为“荒江结屋公千古，异代升堂宋两贤”。杜甫左右祀黄庭坚、陆游。
    我们还看了望江楼、王建墓、宝光寺、大慈寺、昭觉寺等古迹，都只看个大概。
    成都四季皆花，现正是海棠、玉兰花、紫荆花等盛开时候，据说芙蓉花种类多，花最好，所以成都有蓉城之名。川菜很好，几次都吃得太饱。但成都一般只叫“小吃”，小吃大概是要“知味”的意思。
    访幸福社
    去郫县犀浦乡幸福第一社，社主任说：去年亩产已达到一千斤有多，社员每户收入1955年平均三百八十三元，1956年四百四十一元，1957年五百一十元，全社平均每人有一百一十元。全社公积金有十一万元。社员本身存款有六万多元。有个水电厂，日里碾米，晚上照明。社主任说：机器碾米，出米率高，一个打米厂只费一千多元，几个月就捞回了。有九条奶牛产奶量六十多斤供小孩和老人吃。
    今年计划亩产一千七百斤争取二千斤，办法：种双季稻，扩大播种面积。
    此社烈军属受社优待户有十一户，五保户十五户，粮食零用钱都和社员一样。
    我们访问了幸福一社几户农民，社员黄绍铭，贫农，三口人，住房五间，养二只小猪，自留地里有桃、李、橘子树和葡萄架，种的胡豆很茂密。有鸡鸭二十多只。去年做一百六十个劳动日，每日工值八角，今年计划每个劳动日是一元。他的儿子在郫县百货公司工作。屋里家具、被服完全。
    幸福一社是犀浦乡的中等社。
    郫县高维席县长说：全县二十二万人三十七万亩地，都是都江堰灌溉，水利好，气候也好。去年全县已是千斤县了，今年计划增产25％争取30％。农民劲头很大，今年准备买一百台拖拉机，明年增五十台，后年增一百台，全县就机械化了。资金不成问题，各合作社都有钱。电气化也容易，只愁发电机不易买到。技术人员经过短期学习就行。准备搞个肥料厂，主要是颗粒肥。种子是个问题，如洋芋种本地的不能用，要向山地购运。
    全县有贫困户三千六百户，占总户数8％：一种是缺乏劳动力，一种是遇天灾人祸的临时困难，一种是懒汉，不努力劳动。也有人口多劳力少的，通过扶持生产、政府救济、公益金补助、农税减免等方法解决。复员军人三千三百人在生产上起作用不小，当干部的也不少。去年有部分人迫切要求结婚，几下把钱花了，经过教育，已好了一些。　（未完待续）
