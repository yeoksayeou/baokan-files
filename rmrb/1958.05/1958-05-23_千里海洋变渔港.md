    A Thousand Li of Ocean Transforms into Fishing Ports
    (咸水歌)
    The sky connects to the water, and the water connects to the sky,
    Countless stars fill the heavens,
    The treasures in the sea are boundless,
    Even more numerous than the stars.
    The Foshan Special District has a long coastline,
    Exceeding seven hundred kilometers in length,
    With twenty-five fishing ports of all sizes,
    The boundless sea is a fishing ground.
    Sunlight shines on the sea, glittering gold,
    Never forget the Party's call,
    Transform a thousand li of ocean into fishing ports,
    Turn all barren beaches into fish ponds.
    Many people, great strength, everyone knows,
    Machines and boats are good for fishing,
    Mechanization will be achieved in four years,
    Strive for mechanization without delay.
    Last year's marine products were not simple,
    One million, six hundred and thirty thousand dan,
    In four years, it will increase five or six times,
    Ten million dan must be realized.
    Equipped with radar and telegraphs,
    Command and communication are timely,
    Modernize fishing ports of all sizes,
    Large ships and engines go fishing.
    Navigation beacons and lighthouses are installed,
    Build typhoon shelters on the sea,
    Ocean climate can be forecast,
    Fishermen are free from worry.
    Building houses requires bricks,
    Installing machines and repairing ships requires money,
    Expand accumulation, increase diligence and thrift,
    Mobilize investment to install new ships.
    Three years of hard work will lay the foundation,
    The seaport becomes a scenic area,
    Build sanatoriums by the sea,
    Future generations will enjoy happiness.

    千里海洋变渔港
    （咸水歌）　黄辉
    天连水来水连天，
    满天星斗数不完，
    海里宝藏无穷尽，
    更比星斗多万千。
    佛山专区海岸长，
    超过七百公里长，
    大小渔港廿五个，
    无边大海是渔场。
    日照海面闪金光，
    党的号召切勿忘，
    千里海洋变渔港，
    全部荒滩变?塘。
    人多力大人人知，
    机器开船好捕鱼，
    四年实现机械化，
    争取机械化不能迟。
    去年海产不简单，
    一百六十三万担，
    四年要增五六倍，
    一千万担要实行。
    能装雷达电报机，
    指挥联络得及时，
    大小渔港现代化，
    大船机轮去捕鱼。
    航标灯塔来安装，
    海上建设避风塘，
    海洋气候能预告，
    捉鱼人仔免徬徨。
    建房造屋要有砖，
    装机修船要用钱，
    扩大积累加勤俭，
    发动投资装新船。
    苦战三年有根基，
    海港变成风景区，
    海边建设疗养院，
    子孙万代享欢娱。
