Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 27th. The Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee have made a comprehensive plan for the province's agricultural technology revolution, and convened a provincial on-site promotion meeting on agricultural technology revolution on the 25th to deploy and arrange the content and methods of the current agricultural technology revolution.

Hebei Province's agricultural technology revolution includes three main contents: mass agricultural tool reform, universal promotion of field cultivation as gardening, and the whole party and the whole people learning technology. The promotion of field cultivation as gardening is proposed based on three aspects of experience: First, summarize and promote the intensive cultivation techniques of Hebei farmers in managing gardens over the years for managing large fields. Second, universally apply and promote the advanced cultivation techniques of high-yield fields for various crops. Third, fully utilize scientific achievements in all aspects such as cultivation machinery, seeds, fertilizers, and pest control equipment to rapidly improve the level of agricultural technology. Field cultivation as gardening includes continuing to build water conservancy projects, preventing drought and flood, and achieving guaranteed harvests regardless of drought or flood; planning land on a cooperative basis and arranging planting according to water source and soil quality; universally deep plowing and turning the soil, repairing terraced fields and slopes, and improving soil; leveling land, conserving soil, water, and fertilizer; increasing fertilizer application and applying fertilizer in stages and at appropriate times; universally replacing improved varieties; implementing intercropping and multiple cropping to achieve two or three harvests a year; close planting and even sowing to achieve uniform and robust seedlings; promoting sparse watering, ridge watering, ditch watering, and small water frequent watering irrigation techniques, watching the sky, watching the land, and watching the seedlings to water at appropriate times and in appropriate amounts to prevent soil compaction and salinization; and eliminating weeds, pests, and diseases. This on-site promotion meeting required that these technological reforms be gradually promoted and applied in the current field management, and proposed ten new technical measures for the upcoming autumn sowing and next year's summer crop management, requiring all localities to arrange in advance and prepare early, so that the agricultural technology revolution movement will achieve great results in next year's summer harvest.

At the same time, Hebei Province will launch a mass agricultural tool reform movement. This year, it is planned to fully utilize the manpower, materials, and financial resources of agricultural cooperatives, and according to the principles of small and diverse, using local materials, and local sales, mobilize agricultural cooperatives to vigorously manufacture small and medium-sized agricultural tools and agricultural machinery, and promote the development of local industry on the basis of carrying out a large number of agricultural tool reforms. The method of promoting agricultural tool reform is: reform whatever is needed, and currently focus on the needs of summer harvesting, summer planting, summer weeding, and the realization of field cultivation as gardening, arrange reform content, and use, improve, and develop in the reform process, so that the agricultural tool reform movement develops deeply and sustainably. More than 600 relatively exquisite improved agricultural tools were exhibited at this meeting to help people emancipate their minds.

In order to rapidly develop the agricultural technology revolution, Hebei Province plans to launch a technical learning movement for the whole party and the whole people. The province will establish agricultural middle schools in every township, technical schools in every cooperative, and agricultural science research institutes and experimental stations will be established in every special zone and county. Experimental fields, small farms, technical research groups, and laboratories will be established in every township and cooperative. Production increase areas will be established in every team, and every cadre will plant experimental fields, so that everyone studies science and everyone experiments with technology. On the one hand, cadres and the masses are organized to systematically learn science and technology in these schools, and at the same time, they are applied and improved in production practice. Hebei Province requires the leading cadres of local party committees and people's committees, and all rural cadres to take the lead in learning science and technology, in order to drive the technical learning of the whole party and the whole people, and quickly cultivate millions of agricultural experts.

At this meeting, the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Hebei Provincial People's Committee mobilized cadres and farmers throughout the province to act quickly and welcome the agricultural technology revolution. To this end, we must first break down superstitions, emancipate our minds, and break the old view of mystifying science and technology. To do this, the secretary must take action, give prominence to politics, use the abstract to drive the concrete, and use politics to drive technology. When leading farmers in the agricultural technology revolution, it is also necessary to fully mobilize and rely on the masses, actively support mass inventions and creations, encourage advanced elements to think boldly and act boldly, and help the masses advance together. The provincial party committee also requires each party committee secretary to plant a garden-style experimental field, grasp an agricultural tool reform, and delve into an agricultural middle school or agricultural technical school to summarize experience and guide the movement. Hebei Province also plans to vigorously organize collaboration between departments and regions, especially the collaboration and support of industrial, commercial, financial, and financial departments for the agricultural technology revolution, and promote the agricultural technology revolution movement from many aspects.

At this meeting, Yan Dakai, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, conveyed the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party, which further encouraged the confidence of cadres and farmer representatives in carrying out the agricultural technology revolution. After seeing the exhibited improved agricultural tools, many of the more than 600 participating agricultural workers and craftsmen drew pictures and prepared to imitate and promote them when they returned. Representatives of the Zhengding County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, who led the farmers to realize field cultivation as gardening, also put forward a plan to realize the agricultural technology revolution.

    政治挂帅　依靠群众　破除迷信　奋勇前进
    河北全面规划农业技术革命
    当前农业技术革命的主要内容是：开展群众性的农具改革运动，普遍推广耕作园田化，全党全民学技术
    新华社天津27日电　中共河北省委员会和河北省人民委员会已对全省农业技术革命作出全面规划，并在25日召开全省农业技术革命现场促进会议，布置和安排了当前农业技术革命的内容和方法。
    河北省的农业技术革命包括群众性的农具改革、普遍推广耕作园田化和全党全民学习技术三项主要内容。推广耕作园田化是根据三方面经验提出的：首先是总结和推广河北农民历年来经营园田的精耕细作技术用来经营大田。其次是把各种作物高额丰产田的先进耕作技术普遍地运用和推广。第三是充分利用耕作机具、种子、肥料、除虫药械等各方面的科学成就，迅速提高农业技术水平。耕作园田化共包括继续兴修水利，防旱防涝，实现旱涝保收；以社为单位规划土地，根据水源土质安排种植；普遍深耕深翻土地，修整梯田坡地，改良土壤；平整土地，保土保水保肥；增施肥料和分期适时地施肥；普遍改换优良品种；推行套作复种，实现一年两熟或三收；密植匀播，作到棵齐苗壮；推广稀浇、畦浇、沟浇和小水勤浇，看天看地看苗适时适量浇水的灌溉技术，防止土地板结碱化；消灭杂草害虫和病害等十项技术改革。这次现场促进会议要求把这些技术改革在当前的田间管理当中逐步推广运用，并对即将到来的秋季播种和明年夏季作物的管理提出十项新的技术措施，要求各地提前安排，及早准备，使农业技术革命运动在明年的夏季丰收中大见功效。
    同时，河北省将掀起一个群众性的农具改革运动。今年计划充分利用农业社的人力、物力和财力，根据小型多样、就地取材、就地推销的方针，发动农业社大力制造小型、中型的农具和农业机械，并在大量进行农具改革的基础上促进地方工业的发展。推行农具改革的办法是：搞什么改革什么，在当前就是围绕夏收夏种夏锄和实现耕作园田化的需要，安排改革内容，并在改革当中随改随用随提高，使农具改革运动深入持久地发展。这次会议上展出了六百多件比较精彩的改良农具，帮助人们解放思想。
    为了使农业技术革命很快地发展起来，河北省计划开展一个全党全民性的技术学习运动。全省将乡乡办农业中学，社社办技术学校，专区、县普遍建立农业科学研究所、试验站，乡、社普遍建立试验田、小农场、技术研究组和实验室，队队建立增产地，干部人人都种试验田，作到人人研究科学，个个试验技术，一方面组织干部、群众在这些学校中有系统地学习科学技术，同时又在生产实践中运用提高。河北省要求各地党委、人民委员会的领导干部、所有农村干部带头学习科学技术，以带动全党全民的技术学习，迅速培养上百万人的农业专家。
    在这次会议上，中共河北省委和河北省人民委员会动员全省干部、农民迅速行动起来，迎接农业技术革命。为此，首先就要破除迷信，解放思想，打破科学技术神秘化的陈旧观点。这样就必须书记动手，政治挂帅，以虚带实，以政治带技术。在领导农民进行农业技术革命时，还要充分地发动与依靠群众，积极支持群众性的发明创造，鼓励先进分子大胆地想，大胆地干，并帮助群众共同前进。省委还要求每个党委书记种一块园田化的试验田，抓一项农具改革，深入一个农业中学或农业技术学校，总结经验，指导运动。河北省还计划大力组织部门与地区之间的协作，特别是工业、商业、财政、金融部门对农业技术革命的协作和支援，从多方面促进农业技术革命运动。
    在这次会议上，中共河北省委书记处书记阎达开传达了党的八大二次会议精神，更加鼓舞了干部和农民代表开展农业技术革命的信心。参加会议的六百多名农工巧匠，在看了展出的改良农具以后，许多人画了图，准备回去仿造和推广。领导农民实现了耕作园田化的中共正定县委的代表还提出了实现农业技术革命的计划。
