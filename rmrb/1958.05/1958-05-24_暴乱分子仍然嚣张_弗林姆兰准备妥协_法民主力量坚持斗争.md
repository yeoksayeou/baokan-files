Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd, Paris Dispatch: The forces in France that support democratic republicanism and the fascist riot conspirators continue to engage in intense struggle.

    Maurice Thorez, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, commented on the current situation in "l'Humanité," saying, "The working people and the supporters of the republican system have achieved preliminary and important successes, but the struggle is not over. The conspirators have not abandoned their plans, and the victory of the Republic is not guaranteed." He pointed out that fascist conspirators have already established a base in Algeria to exert pressure on France. In Paris, De Gaulle and his accomplices are intensifying pressure on the government and parliament.

    Many local city councils have mobilized the masses to rise up and defend the Republic.

    On the other hand, the rioters and their accomplices are actively engaging in activities, either overtly or covertly.

    The "Social Republican Party" and the "Overseas Union" parliamentary groups of the French Senate issued a statement yesterday, demanding that French President bring De Gaulle to power.

    Pierre Schneiter, leader of the "Independent Party" who has repeatedly refused to participate in the Pflimlin government, met with De Gaulle yesterday, appealing to De Gaulle in a "private" capacity to come out and "mediate" the dispute between the Pflimlin government and the riotous military group in Algeria. Afterwards, Schneiter reported the meeting to Pflimlin. According to a staff member of the Prime Minister's office, De Gaulle once told Schneiter that he was unwilling to take over the government under the current constitution.

    In Algeria, the rioters remain extremely rampant. Salan, the commander of the French forces stationed in Algeria, clamored to march on the Champs-Élysées in Paris to celebrate victory.

    Despite this, the Pflimlin government still hopes to compromise with the right-wing elements and rioters through concessions and appeasement. It announced that it would hand over the power to implement the "Algerian Emergency Law" to Salan.

    At the same time, the Pflimlin government yesterday evening passed a draft amendment to the constitution at a cabinet meeting. The purpose of this bill is to greatly limit the power of the National Assembly, so that the government can wield power exclusively, becoming the kind of "powerful and stable government" that the right-wing and far-right elements demand. The Pflimlin government intends to ask the National Assembly to quickly pass this bill and is prepared to raise a question of confidence. It is reported that some political figures in the French ruling group hope that this amendment to the constitution will satisfy De Gaulle and the riotous group, and agree to compromise with the Pflimlin government.

    暴乱分子仍然嚣张　弗林姆兰准备妥协
    法民主力量坚持斗争
    据新华社23日讯　巴黎消息：法国拥护民主共和的力量和法西斯暴乱阴谋分子继续在进行紧张的斗争。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员罗歇在“人道报”上评论目前的局势说：“劳动人民和共和制度的拥护者已经取得了初步的、重要的成就，但是斗争并没有结束。阴谋分子并没有放弃他们的计划，共和国的胜利还没有保障。”他指出，法西斯阴谋分子已经在阿尔及利亚建立了向法国施加压力的基地。而在巴黎戴高乐和他的同谋者也正在加紧向政府和议会施行压力。
    许多地方的市议会都动员人民群众起来保卫共和国。
    另一方面，暴乱分子及其同谋者也在或明或暗地积极活动。
    共和国参议院“社会共和党”和“海外联盟”议会党团昨天发表声明，要求法国总统让戴高乐上台。
    一再拒绝参加弗林姆兰政府的“独立党”领袖比内，昨天去会见了戴高乐，以“私人”身份呼吁戴高乐出来“调解”弗林姆兰政府和阿尔及利亚的暴乱军人集团之间的纠纷。事后比内又向弗林姆兰汇报了会见情况。据总理秘书处的一个工作人员透露，戴高乐曾经告诉比内，他不愿意在现行宪法的条件下接管政权。
    在阿尔及利亚，暴乱分子仍然十分嚣张。驻阿尔及利亚法军司令萨兰叫嚷要到巴黎爱丽舍大街游行，庆祝胜利。
    尽管如此，弗林姆兰政府仍然希望通过让步和安抚来同右翼分子和暴乱者妥协。它宣布要把施行“阿尔及利亚紧急法”的权力交给萨兰。
    同时，弗林姆兰政府昨天晚上已经在内阁会议上通过了关于修改宪法的草案。这个法案的目的，是要大大限制国民议会的权力，使得政府可以独揽大权，成为右翼和极右翼分子所要求的那种“强有力的、稳定的政府”。弗林姆兰政府打算要求国民议会迅速通过这个法案，并且准备提出信任问题。有消息说，法国统治集团中某些政界人士希望对宪法的这种修改会使戴高乐以及暴乱集团满意，而同意同弗林姆兰政府妥协。
