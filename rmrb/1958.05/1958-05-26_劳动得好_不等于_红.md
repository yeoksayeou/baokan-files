"Working Well" is Not Equal to "Red"

Comrade Yu Zhiming said: "After a year and a half, once I obtain the qualification of a laboring farmer, won't I possess the conditions of a cadre who is both red and expert as required by the Party?" I believe this statement is incorrect. This is an oversimplified understanding of "red." The so-called "red intellectual" is an intellectual who possesses a socialist political direction and wholeheartedly serves the people; this is a fundamental question of outlook on life, from one worldview to another, from individualism to collectivism, from the small self to the great self. Reaching this stage involves a long and arduous journey. I believe that "the qualification of a laboring farmer" and "the conditions of being both red and expert as required by the Party" cannot be equated; obtaining the qualification of a laboring farmer does not necessarily mean one is already "red."

Precisely because Comrade Yu Zhiming has such a mistaken understanding: "After a year and a half, once I obtain the qualification of a laboring farmer, won't I possess the conditions of a cadre who is both red and expert as required by the Party?" Therefore, when others raised opinions to him that he doesn't connect with the masses and is unwilling to do social work... he developed a "knot" in his thinking. This is very natural. Because he equates "working well" with the word "red." This is the main reason for the "knot" in his thinking and has become a stumbling block to his being "both red and expert." Ultimately, from a principled standpoint, Comrade Yu Zhiming's thinking is the thought of "not concerning oneself with politics." How can one achieve the goal of being "red" if one doesn't concern oneself with politics?

### “劳动得好”不等于“红”

   “劳动得好”不等于“红”
    余志明同志说：“过上一年半载取得了劳动农民的资格，自己不就具有了党所要求的又红又专的干部条件吗？”这种说法，我认为是错误的。这是把“红”理解得过分简单化了。所谓“红色知识分子”，就是具有社会主义政治方向、全心全意为人民服务的知识分子；这是从一个世界观转变为另一个世界观、从个人主义转变为集体主义、从小我转变为大我的根本的人生观问题。达到这一步，中间有着遥远而又艰难的路程。我认为，“劳动农民的资格”和“党所要求的又红又专的条件”之间不能划等号；劳动农民的资格取得了，不一定就已经红了。
    正由于余志明同志有这样的错误认识：“过上一年半载取得了劳动农民的资格，自己不就具有了党所要求的又红又专的干部条件吗？”因而当别人向他提出他不联系群众，不愿意做社会工作……的意见时，他思想上就结了“疙瘩”。这是非常自然的。因为他把“劳动得好”同“红”字等同起来。这就是造成他思想上结疙瘩的最主要的原因，同时也成了他“又红又专”的绊脚石。归根结蒂，余志明同志的这种思想，从原则上讲，“就是不问政治”的思想。不问政治，怎么能够达到“红”的目的呢？
