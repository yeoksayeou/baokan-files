Machine Industry Products Blossom
Many Products Reach International Standards

    (Our report) Since the beginning of this year, a vibrant new scene of "a hundred flowers blooming" has emerged in China's machinery manufacturing industry in terms of developing new products. Inspired by the new high tide of socialist construction and the slogan of "catching up with Britain in fifteen years," both state-owned and local factories, large and small, across the country have shown great enthusiasm for developing new products. To date, some of the more important new products that have been successfully trial-produced include: the Y7125 high-precision gear grinding machine, the M1025 centerless grinding machine, the C107A single-spindle automatic lathe (a key piece of equipment for the instrument and bearing industries), the world's most advanced welding equipment (the electroslag welding machine, capable of smoothly welding steel plates with thicknesses ranging from 60 to 250 mm), complete sets of television transmitting equipment, television receivers, semiconductor radios, and various brands of tractors and trucks, and so on.

    Local machinery manufacturing industries have achieved the most outstanding results in trial-producing new products. Many small machinery factories in various regions strive for advancement, liberate their thinking, and have manufactured many urgently needed agricultural machines and transportation equipment for their local areas. For example, according to incomplete statistics, more than thirty different brands of tractors have been successfully trial-produced nationwide, the vast majority of which were collaboratively trial-produced by small local factories.

    Vigorously developing new products to meet the needs of national economic development for various technical equipment is one of the most important tasks facing China's machinery manufacturing industry during the Second Five-Year Plan. Judging from the recent situation of the Great Leap Forward, the scale and speed of trial-producing new products in China's machinery manufacturing industry this year will far exceed any previous year.

    Many new products of great significance for the development of the national economy, such as the large-scale rolling mill equipment capable of processing three million tons of steel billets per year (the 1150 mm primary rolling mill, weighing 5,000 tons), complete sets of 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generating equipment, various heavy and precision machine tools, mainline electric locomotives and diesel locomotives for railway transportation, and equipment for man-made fiber, etc., have all started trial production earlier this year. The complete sets of large-scale nitrogen fertilizer equipment that began trial production last year will be successfully trial-produced this year. The trial production of these major products is being carried out jointly by many factories.

    The Rectification Campaign and the "Double-Anti" Campaign have greatly enhanced the political consciousness and production enthusiasm of engineers, technicians, and workers, and the time from design to production of many new products has been greatly shortened. For example, it used to take about nine months to a year for the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant to design a new product, but now it only takes three to six months. The Changjiang 37-type automobile, jointly manufactured by the Nanjing Chenguang Machine Factory, the Chongqing Jianshe Machine Tool Factory, and other units, was originally planned to be successfully trial-produced before National Day. Under the situation of the Great Leap Forward, the employees, with unprecedented vigor, repeatedly advanced the trial production deadline. From material input and trial production to assembly completion, it only took one month.

    Many of the products that have been successfully trial-produced are of high quality or have reached international standards. The Y7125 high-precision gear grinding machine manufactured by the Shanghai Machine Tool Plant has a pitch error between two teeth of the processed gear of no more than 0.003 mm, which exceeds the precision of the gear grinding machine manufactured by the British Orcutt factory, which is famous for manufacturing grinding machines. The M1025 centerless grinding machine manufactured by the Wuxi Machine Tool Plant has an out-of-roundness error of no more than 0.005 mm for the processed product, and its precision also exceeds that of the centerless grinding machine of the famous British Scrivener factory.

    机器工业产品百花争艳
    许多产品质量达到了国际水平
    本报讯　今年以来，我国机器制造业在发展新产品方面，出现了一个百花争艳的新局面。各地不论国营厂或地方厂，大厂或小厂，在社会主义建设新高潮和
  “十五年赶上英国”的口号的鼓舞下，发展新产品的劲头特别大。到现在为止，已经试制成功的比较重要的新产品有：Y7125型高精度齿轮磨床、M1025型无心磨床、仪表和轴承工业的关键设备——C107A型单轴自动车床、世界最先进的焊接设备——能够顺利地焊接厚度达六十到二百五十公厘钢板的电渣电焊机、全套电视发射设备、电视接收机、半导体收音机和各种牌号的拖拉机与载重汽车等等。
    试制新产品成绩最突出的是地方机器制造业。各地许多小机器工厂，力争上游，解放思想，纷纷制造出许多为当地急需的农业机械和交通运输设备。例如，据不完全统计，全国已经试制成功了三十多种各种牌号的拖拉机，其中绝大部分都是地方小厂协作试制出来的。
    大力发展新产品，满足国民经济发展对于各种技术装备的需要，是我国机器制造业在第二个五年计划期间面临的最重大的任务之一。从最近的大跃进的形势看来，今年我国机器制造业试制新产品的规模和速度将要远远超过以往任何一年。
    许多对发展国民经济具有重大意义的新产品，如全重达五千吨、每年能加工出三百万吨钢坯的大型轧钢设备——一一五○公厘初轧机，五万瓩的全套汽轮发电设备，各种重型的和精密的机床、铁路运输用的干线电气机车、内燃机车，以及人造纤维的设备等等，都提前在今年开始试制。去年开始试制的全套大型氮肥设备，将在今年试制成功。这些重大产品的试制，都是由许多工厂共同协作进行的。
    整风运动和双反运动大大地提高了工程技术人员和工人的政治觉悟和生产积极性，许多新产品从设计到生产的时间都大大缩短了。如上海机床厂过去设计一种新产品大约需要九个月到一年的时间，现在只需要三个月到六个月就行了。由南京晨光机器厂和重庆建设机床厂等单位联合制造的长江三七型汽车，原计划在国庆节前试制成功。在跃进的形势下，职工们以空前的干劲把试制期限一再提前，从投料、试制到装配完成，只用一个月的时间。
    已经试制成功的许多产品中，很多是质量很高或具有国际水平的。上海机床厂制造的Y7125型高精度齿轮磨床，加工的齿轮两个牙齿之间的节距误差不超过○·○○三公厘，这个精度超过了以制造磨床著名的英国奥柯脱工厂制造的齿轮磨床。无锡机床厂制造的M1025型无心磨床，加工产品的外圆椭圆度误差不超过○·○○五公厘，精度也超过了英国著名的斯克莱芬工厂的无心磨床。
