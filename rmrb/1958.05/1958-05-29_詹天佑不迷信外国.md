Zhan Tianyou was born into a declining merchant family. He was very poor in his childhood. When he grew up, it was a time when imperialists were invading China and our country's territory and sovereignty were being trampled upon. Therefore, after Zhan Tianyou became a railway engineer, he was determined not to rely on foreigners and to build China's railways well. At that time, he was responsible for the construction of the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway. This line included difficult projects such as passing through Badaling. Because Zhan Tianyou closely relied on the railway workers at the time and worked hard himself, he finally completed the Beijing-Zhangjiakou Railway quickly. Since then, he became an internationally renowned railway engineer.

In addition to constructing some railway projects, Zhan Tianyou's invention of the train coupling hook—the Zhan Tianyou hook—is also the most unforgettable.

    詹天佑不迷信外国
    詹天佑出身于一个没落的商人家庭。幼小的时候，家里很穷。长大后，又正是帝国主义侵略中国，我国的领土和主权遭人蹂躏的时候。所以詹天佑作了铁路工程师后，一心发奋不要依靠外国人，要把我国的铁路修好。当时他负责修建京张路。这条线路，包括穿过八达岭等艰巨工程。由于詹天佑紧紧依靠了当时的铁路工人，自己又刻苦钻研，终于很快地修好了京张路。从此变成了国际上有名的铁路工程师。
    詹天佑除了修建了一些铁路工程外，他所发明的火车接头的挂钩——詹天佑钩，也是最使人念念不忘的。
