　　Chongqing to Retail Biogas to Citizens
    (Our newspaper, Chongqing, 13th dispatch) The Chongqing Second Commercial Bureau is actively preparing to establish a biogas company to help rural areas and factories design and build biogas stations. The biogas company will use several locations in the city where sewage, garbage, and manure are relatively concentrated to build biogas plants or biogas power stations. These plants and stations will begin retailing biogas to citizens for lighting, cooking, and heating before July 1st this year. Currently, two biogas power stations with volumes of 200 cubic meters and 100 cubic meters are under construction, and more than six biogas power stations or biogas plants of the same scale will be built within this year.
    After the great leap forward in industrial production in Chongqing this year, the city's demand for industrial electricity and coal has increased significantly. Due to the shortage of electricity, factories have to take turns shutting down. In the future, if all civilian electricity and fuel such as civilian coal are replaced by biogas, the supply of industrial electricity and coal can be greatly increased.
    (Our newspaper, Chengdu, 13th dispatch) Sichuan Province has built many biogas power stations and biogas digesters, bringing a large amount of cheap power and fuel to agricultural production. A biogas digester with a total volume of 38 cubic meters in a supply and marketing cooperative in Santai County produces 8 cubic meters of gas per day, which can light forty 200-candlepower gauze lamps.

　　重庆将向市民零售沼气
    本报重庆13日电　重庆市第二商业局正在积极筹备成立一个沼气公司，以便帮助农村和工厂设计和修建沼气站。沼气公司将要利用全市几处污水、垃圾、粪便等脏物较集中的地方，修建沼气厂或沼气发电站。这些厂、站将分别在今年7月1日以前开始零售沼气供应市民点灯、煮饭、取暖。目前两个容积二百立方公尺和一百立方公尺的沼气发电站已经动工兴建，今年内将要修建同样规模的沼气发电站或沼气厂六个以上。
    重庆市在今年工业生产大跃进以后，全市所需的工业用电和用煤量大增。因为用电紧张，所以工厂不得不轮流停电。今后如果全市民用电和民用煤等燃料以沼气来代替，就可以大大增加工业用电和用煤的供应。
    本报成都13日电　四川省建成了许多沼气发电站和沼气池，给农业生产带来大量的廉价动力和燃料。三台县供销合作社的一个总容积三十八立方公尺的沼气池，每昼夜产出八立方公尺的气体，每天可点二百支光的纱罩灯四十盏。
