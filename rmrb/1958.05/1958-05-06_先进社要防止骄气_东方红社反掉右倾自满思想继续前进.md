Advanced Cooperatives Must Guard Against Complacency
Dongfanghong Cooperative Combats Right-Leaning Complacent Thought, Continues to Advance

(Report from this newspaper) The Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Qingxiu Township, Qin County, Shanxi Province, through the "Double-Anti" movement, combated right-leaning thought, conservative measures, and waste of labor and resources during the Great Leap Forward, burned away stagnation and complacency, and pushed the spring plowing and sowing work to a climax.

The Dongfanghong Cooperative is one of the five model cooperatives in Qin County. As early as the beginning of December last year, it formulated a Great Leap Forward plan for doubling this year's output, achieving a per-mu yield of 413 *jin*, and increasing fertilizer by one-fold, applying 100 *dan* per *mu*. However, recent inspections and understanding revealed that various tasks were poorly completed. The task of accumulating fertilizer was only 50% complete, and the water conservancy project was only 80% complete. The reason for this situation was that most Party members and cadres did not fully understand the Great Leap Forward, and ideological problems were not resolved. Some people were arrogant and complacent, believing that the land was good and there were many river bends, so it would not be subject to major disasters, and achieving a per-mu yield of 400 *jin* would not be a problem. Others thought, "We are a good cooperative, as long as other villages can achieve it, we can also achieve it." This neglected leadership over the Great Leap Forward. Another part of the people had serious right-leaning conservative thoughts, not believing that there could be a Great Leap Forward this year. Because the Party members and cadres were like this, the masses' thoughts on the Leap Forward were even more complicated.

After finding the root of the problem, the work team stationed in the cooperative and the Party branch jointly conducted research and discussion, and decided to adopt the following methods:

1.  Publicity and education on the important significance of the Great Leap Forward were carried out from within the Party to the masses, and through inspection and comparison, the minds of all Party members and cadres were cleared, and the broad masses of cooperative members were also educated.

2.  Visits were organized to introduce the experience of the Nanwang Cooperative in transforming from backward to advanced, which greatly surprised everyone. Those who were arrogant and complacent were no longer complacent, and those who were right-leaning and conservative became active.

3.  On the basis of raising the awareness of Party members, League members and activists, the whole cooperative's Party members, League members and masses jointly launched a movement to oppose right-leaning conservatism, arrogance and complacency, and oppose waste in all aspects such as labor, agricultural tools, and expenses. Through comparative accounting, not only were the right-leaning conservatism and arrogance and complacency of Party members and cadres effectively criticized, but the cooperative members were also greatly educated. The whole cooperative launched a "everyone contributes ideas and suggestions, every Party member and cadre does a good deed" movement to compare, learn from, and catch up with the advanced, loving the country, loving the cooperative, and loving the family. Everyone unanimously guaranteed to strive to achieve the Great Leap Forward plan of a per-mu yield of 413 *jin*.

In the current production, a ten-day movement to accumulate 20,000 *dan* of fertilizer is underway. Each household submits 100 *dan* of fertilizer to the cooperative. In terms of water conservancy, a surprise attack method is used to complete the earthwork within ten days. Wheat should be top-dressed with fertilizer once universally. In order to overcome the difficulty of insufficient labor in the Great Leap Forward, 30 wooden-wheeled carts have been modified. Now the cadres and members of the cooperative are full of confidence and have great enthusiasm. Competitions have started between teams and between people.

### 先进社要防止骄气  东方红社反掉右倾自满思想继续前进

    先进社要防止骄气
    东方红社反掉右倾自满思想继续前进
    本报讯　山西省沁县青修乡东方红农业社通过双反运动，反掉大跃进中的思想右倾、措施保守和劳力、财力浪费之后，烧掉了暮气、骄气，把春耕播种工作推向高潮。
    东方红社是沁县五个模范社之一。早在去年12月上旬，就订出今年产量翻一番，亩产四百一十三（斤）肥料加一倍，亩施一百担的跃进计划。但是在不久前经过检查了解，各项工作却完成得很差。积肥任务只完成50％，水渠工程完成80％，形成上述状况的原因，是大部分党团员干部，对大跃进认识不足，思想问题没得到解决。一部分人是骄傲自满，一种是认为土地好、河湾地多，不受大灾害，实现亩产四百斤不成问题。另一种认为“咱是好社，只要其它村能达到，咱就也能达到。”忽视对大跃进的领导。另一部分人是右倾保守思想严重，不相信今年能大跃进，由于党员干部是这样子，群众对跃进思想就更复杂了。
    病根找着以后，住社工作组和党支部，共同作了研究讨论，决定采用以下办法：
    1、由党内到群众进行了大跃进重要意义的宣传教育工作，并通过检查评比，清醒了所有党团员的头脑，也教育了广大社员。
    2、组织参观，介绍了南王社落后变先进的经验，从而使大家大吃一惊，骄傲自满的人不自满了，右倾保守的也积极起来了。
    3、在提高党团积极分子觉悟的基础上，全社党团员群众一起开展了反对右倾保守、骄傲自满，反对劳力、农具、开支等各方面的浪费运动。通过对比算账，不仅有力地批评了党团员干部的右倾保守和骄傲自满思想，同时也大大地教育了社员群众。全社开展了人人献计献策，每个党团干部办一件好事的比先进、学先进、赶先进的爱国爱社爱家运动。大家一致保证努力实现亩产四百一十三斤的跃进计划。
    在当前生产上，开展十天积肥二万担运动。每户交社肥一百担，在水利上，用突击办法十天内把土工完成。小麦要普追一次肥。为了克服大跃进中劳力不足的困难，先改制木轮小平车三十辆，现在社干、社员信心百倍，劲头很大，队与队、人与人展开了竞赛。
