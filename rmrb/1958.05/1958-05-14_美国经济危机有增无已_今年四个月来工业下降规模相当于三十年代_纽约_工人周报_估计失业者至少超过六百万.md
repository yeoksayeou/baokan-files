　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th: According to a report in Berlin's "Neues Deutschland" on the 6th, US industrial production further decreased in April of this year. If industrial production at the beginning of this year is taken as 100, the US industrial production index had already fallen to 90.6 by the end of March, and further fell to 89.5 in the first week of April, 88.6 in the second week, 87.5 in the third week, and 86.0 in the fourth week. That is to say, in the short four months from the beginning of this year to the end of April, US industrial production fell by 14%, equivalent to the scale of the annual decline in US industrial production during the Great Depression of 1929-1932.

　　In agriculture, according to an announcement by the US Department of Agriculture on the 8th, the area sown with cotton in the year ending June 30th of this year decreased by 16% compared to the previous year. Domestic cotton consumption in the United States has also greatly decreased due to the impact of the crisis. The price of cotton per pound has fallen from $0.3175 to $0.295.

　　In terms of employment, the New York "Workers' Weekly" exposed the lie deliberately fabricated by the US government that the number of unemployed in the United States decreased by 78,000 in April. The newspaper said that there are currently more than three million unemployed workers eligible to receive relief from the government, 700,000 unemployed workers who are eligible to receive such relief but have exhausted their benefits, and 300,000 unemployed workers who have not received such relief but have received unemployment benefits elsewhere. The total number of these three types of workers is more than four million, accounting for about 60% of all unemployed workers. Therefore, the total number of unemployed workers will be at least more than six million.

　　According to US newspapers, workers' and employees' incomes are constantly decreasing due to capitalists laying off large numbers of workers. The US government announced on the 12th that in April of this year, the national industrial and salary income in the United States decreased by $500 million compared to March, and by $8.4 billion compared to the peak in August last year.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 13th, Miami Beach City News: William Pollock, President of the Textile Workers Union of America, condemned the US government at the union's convention here on the 12th for doing nothing to improve international tensions and the domestic economic crisis.

　　Pollock said that for the past six years, the US textile industry "has been in recession," with more than a thousand textile factories closing down and the situation of 300,000 workers getting worse and worse. Pollock called on American workers to take political action to drive the Eisenhower administration out of power.

　　美国经济危机有增无已
    今年四个月来工业下降规模相当于三十年代
    纽约“工人周报”估计失业者至少超过六百万
    新华社13日讯　据柏林“新德意志报”6日报道，在今年4月份，美国工业生产进一步减少。如果以今年年初的工业生产为一百，到3月底美国工业生产指数已经下降到九十点六，4月份第一周进一步下降到八十九点五，第二周下降到八十八点六，第三周下降到八十七点五，第四周下降到八六点○。这就是说，从今年年初到4月底的短短四个月内，美国工业生产下降了14％，相当于1929—1932年经济大危机年度美国工业生产下降的规模。
    在农业方面，据美国农业部8日宣布，在今年6月30日结束的一年内，美国棉花的播种面积比上一年减少16％。美国国内棉花的消费量也因为危机的影响而大大减少。每磅棉花的价格已经从○点三一七五美元跌到○点二九五美元。
    在就业方面，纽约“工人周报”揭穿了美国政府蓄意编制的所谓4月份美国失业人数减少七万八千人的谎言。报纸说，目前有资格在政府那里领到救济金的失业工人一共有三百多万，有资格领取这种救济金但是已经用完了救济金的失业工人有七十万、没有领取这种救济金但是在别的地方领取到失业津贴的失业工人有三十万。上述这三种工人合计有四百多万人，约占全部失业工人的60％。因此全部失业工人的人数最少将超过六百万。
    据美国报刊说，由于资本家大批解雇工人，工人和职员的收入正在不断减少。美国政府12日宣布，在今年4月份，美国全国的工业和薪金收入比3月份减少了五亿美元，比去年8月份的高峰减少了八十四亿美元。
    新华社13日讯　美国迈阿密海滩城消息：美国纺织工人联合会主席威廉·波洛克12日在这里举行的这个联合会的大会上谴责美国政府不做任何事情来改善国际紧张局势和国内经济危机。
    波洛克说，过去六年中，美国纺织工业“一直在衰退中”，一千多个纺织工厂关了门，三十万工人情况越来越坏。波洛克呼吁美国工人采取政治行动把艾森豪威尔政府赶下台。
