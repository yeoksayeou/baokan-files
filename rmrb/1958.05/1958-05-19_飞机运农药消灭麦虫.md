Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 18th: Nine airplanes, which took off from Chengdu on the 16th, landed at Nanjing airport carrying twenty tons of pesticides. This is a portion of the over two hundred tons of sulfur powder that Sichuan Province is providing to Jiangsu.

To date, nine provinces and cities, including Anhui, Henan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Guangdong, and Shanghai, have supported Jiangsu with nearly 30 million jin of sulfur powder and sulfur blocks. The Civil Aviation Administration of China has transferred passenger planes from cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Urumqi, removing the seats to specifically transport this batch of pesticides, which arrived in Nanjing on the same day. When the planes landed, trucks were already waiting to transport the pesticides to the ship docks, from where they were shipped to Liuyi, and then immediately transported by trucks to various locations. This batch of pesticides, after traveling over three thousand li, arrived in Nanjing in just over six hours and was transported to Gaoyou, Baoying, and other counties that very night to treat the insect pests occurring in the wheat fields.

　　飞机运农药消灭麦虫
    据新华社南京18日电　16日从成都起飞的九架飞机，载着二十吨农药，在南京机场降落。这是四川省支援江苏二百多吨农药中的一部分硫磺粉。
    到现在为止，已有安徽、河南、四川、山西、陕西、江西、辽宁、广东、上海等九个省市，支援江苏硫磺粉和硫磺块近三千万斤。中国民用航空局从北京、上海、广州、成都和乌鲁木齐等市调拨客机，拆除了座位，专门运送这批农药，当天就到达南京。飞机降落时，早已有汽车把农药运到轮船码头，由轮船运往六圩，然后再由汽车马上运往各地。这批农药仅以六个多小时的时间，经过三千多里到达南京，当夜即运到高邮、宝应等县，治理麦田中发生的虫害。
