Units Currently Conducting "Discussions on Vacuity" Should Further Eliminate Superstition, Break Down Inferiority Complexes, Promote the Spirit of Originality, and Promote the Great Liberation of Communist Thought.
Units Entering the "Red vs. Expert" Debate Should Launch a Great Debate to Promote Proletarian Ideology and Eliminate Bourgeois Ideology, Eradicate Individualistic Thought and Neutral Stances, and Call on Everyone to Plant Red Flags and Uproot White Flags.

Xinhua News Agency, 26th: Central state organs are further deepening the rectification movement in conjunction with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, in order to thoroughly liberate the thinking of leaders, liberate the thinking of the masses, and strive to further promote the work of the central state organs and the overall high tide of communist thought. The Central State Organs Committee of the Communist Party of China held an enlarged meeting of its standing committee on the 26th, specifically to discuss how to further carry out the rectification movement in light of the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, and based on the specific circumstances of the rectification movement in each organ.

Currently, most units in the central state organs have launched a surge of "Discussions on Vacuity," and some units have begun to enter the "Red vs. Expert" debate. In order to carry the rectification movement through to the end, the Party Committee believes that it is necessary to take advantage of the current favorable situation to immediately convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress among Party members and the masses, and conduct a preliminary study of the documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. According to the specific circumstances of each unit, units that are currently conducting "Discussions on Vacuity" are required to further eliminate superstition, break down inferiority complexes, promote the spirit of originality of daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to do, and promote the great liberation of communist thought, focusing on the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress; among leading cadres, it is also required to further establish a dialectical materialist way of thinking, respect materialism, and master dialectics through "Discussions on Vacuity." Units that have basically resolved various important policy and ideological issues through "Discussions on Vacuity" should also use vacuity to drive reality, especially to solve the problem of the working methods of the central ministries, that is, how a department of the central government should work after the devolution of power, and how to strive for progress so that the central ministries can be ahead of the movement and ahead of the masses in guiding their work, rather than falling behind the situation. In addition, units that have already entered the "Red vs. Expert" debate are required to launch a great debate to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology among all cadres, especially intellectual cadres and engineering and technical personnel, in accordance with the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, eradicate all bourgeois individualistic thoughts and "intermediate stances," and call on everyone to plant red flags and uproot white flags.

The Party Committee meeting demanded that all units must make practical arrangements for the rectification movement based on the current situation, seize the opportunity, and not let time slip away. All units must seize this final and crucial step of the rectification movement and strive to create a new political situation to promote an all-round upsurge in work and thought. The meeting pointed out that if a new political situation does not emerge in an organ, the rectification movement must be re-examined and re-deployed. In short, the rectification movement must be carried out to the end.

    根据“八大”会议的精神更彻底地解放思想
    中央国家机关决心把整风运动坚持到底
    正在进行“论虚”的单位，要进一步破除迷信，打破自卑感，发扬独创精神，促进共产主义思想的大解放。
    进入红专辩论的单位，要掀起兴无灭资的大辩论，肃清个人主义思想和中间立场，号召人人插红旗，拔白旗。
    新华社26日讯　中央国家机关正在结合“八大”第二次会议的精神，把整风运动进一步推向深入，以彻底解放领导思想，解放群众思想，争取进一步促进中央国家机关的工作和共产主义思想的全面高涨。中国共产党中央国家机关委员会26日举行常委扩大会议，专门讨论了如何结合“八大”第二次会议的精神，根据各机关整风运动的具体情况，进一步开展整风运动的问题。
    当前中央国家机关大多数单位都已掀起“论虚”的热潮，有的单位开始进入红专大辩论。为了把整风运动坚持到底，党委会认为必须利用当前有利形势，立即在党内和群众中分别传达“八大”第二次会议的精神，对“八大”第二次会议的文件进行初步学习。根据各单位的具体情况，凡是正在进行“论虚”的单位，要求围绕“八大”第二次会议的精神，进一步破除迷信，打破自卑感，发扬敢说、敢想、敢做的独创精神，促进共产主义思想的大解放；在领导干部中，还要求通过“论虚”进一步树立辩证唯物主义的思想方法，尊重唯物论，人人掌握辩证法。通过“论虚”基本解决了各种重要的政策思想问题的单位，还要以虚带实，特别是解决中央各部的工作方法问题，也就是作为中央的一个部门在体制下放以后，今后应该怎样工作的问题，怎样本着力争上游的精神，在工作的指导上，使中央各部能够赶在运动的前面，赶在群众的前面，而不致落在形势的后面。此外，凡是已经进入了红专辩论的单位，要求根据“八大”第二次会议的精神，在全体干部中特别是知识分子干部和工程技术人员中，掀起兴无灭资的大辩论，肃清一切资产阶级个人主义思想和“中间立场”，号召人人插红旗，拔白旗。
    党委会议要求，各单位一定要根据当前的形势，对整风运动作出切实的安排，要抓紧时机，而不要让时间滑过去。所有单位都要抓住整风运动这最后的关键性的一步，力争创造一种新的政治局面，促进工作和思想的全面高涨。会议指出，如果在一个机关中没有新的政治局面出现，就必须对整风运动重新进行检查、重新部署，总之要把整风运动坚持进行到底。
