Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th – Secret agents Wu Qian and Lin Lu, dispatched by the Chiang Kai-shek group's secret service organization in Hong Kong to infiltrate Guangdong Province for sabotage and intelligence gathering, have been sentenced to death with the approval of the Supreme People's Court. Wu Qian was executed in Huiyang County on the 27th, and Lin Lu was executed in Guangzhou City on the 28th. In addition, the Guangdong and Guangzhou Municipal People's Courts recently sentenced another secret agent, Wu Yishan, to death with a reprieve, and, in accordance with the policy of leniency for those who confess, granted lenient treatment with exemption from prosecution to secret agents Li Chengkun, Lin Bing, and Shao Danan who turned themselves in.

The executed secret agent Wu Qian was dispatched by the Kuomintang "Intelligence Bureau" in Hong Kong before National Day last year to infiltrate Shenzhen Town, south of Guangzhou City, plotting to blow up the Shenzhen Theater during a film screening. However, he was arrested by our public security organs before he could act. The other executed secret agent, Lin Lu, joined the Chiang Kai-shek group's "Second Department of the Ministry of National Defense" secret service organization in Macau in 1955 and received various secret service training. In 1956, he twice sneaked back to Guangzhou for activities and later returned to Guangzhou, where he remained in hiding for a long time. The Kuomintang secret service organization appreciated his criminal activities and designated him as a "representative" of the mainland area when the Kuomintang held its "Eighth National Congress" in 1957. Just as he was trying every means to smuggle himself out of the country to Taiwan to attend the meeting, he unexpectedly fell into the people's net.

The secret agent Wu Yishan, who was sentenced to death with a reprieve, joined a secret service organization in Hong Kong in 1957 and infiltrated Guangzhou in mid-September. He reported intelligence to the secret service organization several times. He was arrested at the station on his way to Hong Kong.

Secret agents Li Chengkun, Lin Bing, and Shao Danan who turned themselves in were granted lenient treatment with exemption from prosecution.

    广东处决两名特务
    投案自首的李成坤等受到宽大处理
    据新华社广州29日电　由香港蒋介石集团特务机关派遣潜入广东省进行爆破和搜集情报等阴谋活动的特务分子巫谦、林陆，已经最高人民法院批准判处死刑。巫谦已经在27日在惠阳县执行死刑，林陆28日在广州市执行死刑。此外，广东省和广州市人民法院最近还判处了另一特务分子吴义珊死刑缓期执行，并且根据坦白从宽的政策，对投案自首的特务分子李成坤、林炳和邵大楠给予免予起诉的宽大处理。
    被处决的特务分子巫谦，去年国庆节前夕由香港国民党“情报局”派遣潜入广州市南部的深圳镇，阴谋在放电影的时候爆破深圳戏院。但他没来得及下手就被我公安机关逮捕了。被处决的另一名特务林陆1955年在澳门参加蒋介石集团“国防部二厅”特务组织，曾受过多种特务工作训练。1956年先后两次潜回广州进行过活动，后来又回广州，长期潜伏。国民党特务机关对他的罪恶活动很赏识，1957年国民党召开“八全大会”时，曾指定他为大陆地区的“代表”。正当他千方百计地企图偷渡出境前往台湾参加开会的时候，他意外地落入了人民的法网。
    判处死刑缓期执行的特务分子吴义珊1957年在香港参加特务组织后，9月中旬潜入广州，他几次向特务机关报告了情报，在他将去香港时，在车站上被逮捕。
    投案自首的特务分子李成坤、林炳、邵大楠获得了免予起诉的宽大处理。
