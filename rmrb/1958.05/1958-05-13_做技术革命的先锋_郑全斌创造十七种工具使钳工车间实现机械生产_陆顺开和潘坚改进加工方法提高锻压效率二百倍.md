Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th: Zheng Quanbin, a young fitter and Communist Party member at the Jiaozuo Coal Mine Repair Factory, has recently created seventeen advanced machines and tools in the past two months. This has transformed many manual operations in the fitter's workshop into mechanized production. As a result, he can complete twenty-four years' worth of work in one year.

　　Jiaozuo Coal Mine is experiencing a great leap forward in production and capital construction this year. The coal production target alone has jumped from 2.4 million tons last year to 3.5 million tons. The repair factory's tasks were already heavy, but to support the mechanization of agriculture, they also undertook the challenging task of producing 2,000 electric motors. In this situation, the fitter's workshop, which had always relied on manual operation, became an obstacle to the factory's production leap forward. For example, to manufacture the "rotor," the heart of an electric motor, twelve young men working for a whole day could only produce silicon steel sheets enough for one "rotor," i.e. 600 sheets; to produce all 1.2 million silicon steel sheets needed for all the electric motors, these twelve people would need six years. In coal mine production and capital construction, due to the increasing degree of mechanization, large quantities of "power contactor" accessories are frequently needed. These copper parts are diverse and complex to manufacture; even making a small part requires seven or eight processes.

　　Targeting these weak links in production, Zheng Quanbin boldly reformed the backward technology. His created "small electric punch press" requires only one person to operate and can complete the production of 2.2 million silicon steel sheets in ten months. This production efficiency is more than 140 times higher than manual operation, saving more than 5,660 workdays per year. With the help of retired old foundry worker Deng Changfu, he created the "universal casting mold," which generally increased the production efficiency of the factory's more than thirty types of copper parts by four to seven times.

　　When the factory organized a great leap forward in production in February this year, Zheng Quanbin proposed using technological innovation to ensure the completion of five years' worth of work in one year as his personal leap forward plan. The factory's Party committee decided to have a deputy secretary of the Communist Youth League and an engineer help him achieve this ambitious ideal from ideological and technical perspectives. The factory's administrative leaders also provided strong support in terms of time, manpower, and resources. Zheng Quanbin's achievements in technological innovation in the past two months have not only realized his advanced leap forward plan but have also far exceeded the original targets.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 10th: Veteran workers Lu Shunkai and Pan Jian from the forging workshop of the Guangdong Agricultural Machinery Factory, when producing the "chain cover bottom" for hand-held tractors, improved the operating methods and increased production efficiency by more than two hundred times.

　　In the past, the "chain cover bottom" for hand-held tractors was manufactured manually at this factory. One person could only produce one per day, and the product quality was difficult to guarantee. Veteran worker Lu Shunkai wanted to use a punch press to manufacture the "chain cover bottom." His idea received the active support of Pan Jian. After working together for four days and nights, carefully estimating the pressure of the punch press in the workshop, they designed and manufactured a set of "chain cover bottom" molds using old scrap materials and installed them on the punch press to punch the "chain cover bottom." Initially, the punched "chain cover bottom" did not meet specifications, but with the help of higher-level leaders, they overcame the difficulties and further researched and improved the mold, finally achieving success.

　　The factory's use of Lu Shunkai and Pan Jian's improved operating methods to manufacture the "chain cover bottom" not only resulted in good product quality, consistent specifications, and a smooth shell surface, but also allowed an ordinary worker to manufacture more than two hundred units per day, which is more than two hundred times higher than manual operation. This year, the factory plans to produce 120 hand-held tractors. In the past, manufacturing so many "chain cover bottoms" for these tractors by hand would have taken four months to complete; after switching to punching, it only took more than two hours to complete.

    据新华社郑州12日电　焦作煤矿修理厂青年钳工、共产党员郑全斌，在最近两个月来连续创造了十七种先进机器和工具，把钳工车间许多手工操作变成了机械化生产，他自己也能因此一年完成二十四年的工作量。
    焦作煤矿今年生产和基本建设都在突飞猛进，仅煤炭的生产任务就由去年的二百四十万吨跃进到三百五十万吨。这个修理厂的任务本来已经很繁重，但为了支援农业实现机械化，他们还负担了生产两千部电动机的艰巨任务。在这种情况下，一向手工操作的钳工车间就成了这个修理厂生产跃进的障碍。像制造电动机的心脏——“转子”，十二个青年小伙子干一天，只能打成一个“转子”所需的六百页矽钢片；全部电动机上所需的一百二十万页矽钢片，这十二个人要干六年才能完成。又如煤矿生产和基本建设中，由于机械化程度不断提高，经常需要大批“动力接触子”配件。这种铜活品种繁多，制造复杂，就是作一个很小的活件也得经过七、八道工序。
    郑全斌针对生产中的这些薄弱环节，就大胆革新落后的技术。他创造的“小型电动冲床”，只需一人在上面操作，十个月就可以完成二百二十万页矽钢片的生产任务，生产效率比手工操作提高一百四十多倍，一年能节省五千六百六十多个工作日。他在已退休的老铸工邓长富的帮助下创造的“万能铸件胎”，使全厂所制造的三十多种铜活的生产效率，普遍提高四倍到七倍。
    这个厂在今年2月间组织生产大跃进的时候，郑全斌提出用革新技术的方法，保证一年完成五年工作量的个人跃进规划。厂里党委决定由一个团委副书记和一个工程师从思想上、从技术上帮助他实现这个豪迈的理想。厂的行政领导并且从时间、人力、物力上给予大力支持。郑全斌两个月来的技术革新的成果，不仅实现了他的先进的跃进规划，并且远远超过了原订的指标。
    新华社广州10日电　广东农业机械厂锻压车间老工人陆顺开、潘坚，在生产手扶拖拉机的“链冚底”时，改进操作方法，提高生产效率二百倍以上。
    这个厂过去生产手扶拖拉机的“链冚底”是用手工制造的，一人一天只能生产一个，而且产品质量不易保证。老工人陆顺开想用冲床机制造“链冚底”，他的想法得到潘坚的积极支持。他们经过四昼夜的共同琢磨，在车间仔细地估量了冲床机的压力情况，就自己动手设计，利用旧废料制成一套“链冚底”的工模，装在冲床机上冲压“链冚底”。开始时，冲压出的“链冚底”不合规格，但他们在上级领导的帮助下，克服了困难，又研究改进了工模，终于获得成功。
    这个厂采用陆顺开、潘坚改进的操作方法来制造“链冚底”，不但产品质量好，规格一致，壳面光滑，而且一天只用一普通工就能制造出二百个以上，比手工操作提高生产效率二百倍以上。今年这个厂要生产手扶拖拉机一百二十台，过去用手工制造这么多拖拉机的“链冚底”，需要四个月才能完成任务；改用冲压以后，只用两个多小时就完成了。
