Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot -- On the vast grasslands of Inner Mongolia, nearly 90% of the Mongolian, Ewenki, Daur, and other ethnic herders who have lived nomadic lives following water and grass for thousands of years have now achieved "settled nomadism" and "semi-settled nomadism," and have begun the construction of settled areas on the grasslands. This is a major transformation in production and life for the herders, carried out with the strong support of the Party and the government.

In the early days of Liberation, there were approximately 44,500 herding households in Inner Mongolia, who nomadically grazed on the boundless grasslands year-round. Settled nomadism has created favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry. In the past, nomadic herders were unable to carry out production construction and could not avoid livestock losses due to disasters. Now, herders have built more than 38,000 spacious livestock sheds, more than 4,000 water wells, and more than 190,000 mu of artificial feed bases in their settled areas. New-style pastoral machinery such as hay mowers, water carts, and milk separators have become the main production tools. Many herders have mastered techniques such as preventing and controlling animal diseases, driving tractors, building houses, and cultivating crops. In some settled areas, the state has also helped herders build mechanical water supply stations, veterinary stations, schools, shops, health clinics, and bathhouses; many pastoral cooperatives and mutual aid groups have established nurseries in the settled areas, purchased radios and sewing machines, and planted trees, melons, and vegetables, and raised pigs and chickens, enriching the content of production and life.

With the construction of herder settlements and the development of various construction undertakings in pastoral areas, more than one hundred new-type economic and cultural centers have emerged on the grasslands in recent years. At these central points, many small and medium-sized factories and mines have been built, including those for dairy products, leather, wool products, electricity generation, coal, bricks and tiles, and grain and feed processing. Stores, schools, hospitals, cinemas, theaters, and clubs are also increasing year by year.

To settle all the herders who have been living nomadically for many years is an important project in the current construction of pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia. According to the new situation of the current great leap forward in animal husbandry, the autonomous region has decided to help all of the existing 8,000+ nomadic households and 25,000+ semi-nomadic households achieve settlement within the next four years.

### 内蒙古大部牧户定居游牧

    内蒙古大部牧户定居游牧
    据新华社呼和浩特讯　在辽阔的内蒙古大草原上，千百年来逐水草而居的蒙古、鄂温克、达斡尔等族牧民，目前将近有90％的牧户已经实现了“定居游牧”和“半定居游牧”，开始了草原定居地的建设。这是牧民们在党和政府大力帮助下进行的生产和生活上的重大变革。
    解放初期，内蒙古大约有四万四千五百多户牧民，常年游牧在无边的草原上。定居游牧为畜牧业的发展创造了有利条件。过去游牧牧民无法进行生产建设，无法避免牲畜因灾损失。现在牧民们在定居地上建筑起三万八千多座宽大的牲畜棚圈、四千多眼水井和十九万多亩人工饲料基地。打搂草机、水车、牛奶分离机等新式牧业机械，已成为主要生产工具。许多牧民掌握了防治兽疫、驾驶拖拉机、修建房屋和耕种农作物等技术。有些定居地上，国家还帮助牧民兴建了机械供水站、兽医站、学校、商店、卫生所和浴池等；许多牧业社和互助组在定居地上举办了托儿所，购置了收音机、缝纫机，还种了树、瓜和蔬菜，养了猪鸡，生产和生活的内容更丰富了。
  随着牧民定居地的建设和牧区各项建设事业的发展，近几年来草原上已经出现了一百多个新型的经济文化中心。在这些中心点上，兴建起乳品、皮革、毛制、发电、煤炭、砖瓦和粮食饲料加工等许多中小型厂矿企业。商店、学校、医院、电影院、剧院和俱乐部等也都一年年的多起来。
    让多年来逐水草而居的牧民全部定居下来，是当前内蒙古牧区建设中的一个重要项目。自治区根据目前牧业大跃进的新形势，确定在今后四年内，帮助现有八千多个游牧户和二万五千多个半游牧户全部实现定居。
