Supporting agriculture and animal husbandry with the good stuff – Distillers' Grains

Distillers' grains are waste from the brewing industry. Last year, the distillers' grains produced by the national brewing industry could feed 2.7 million pigs for a year, and the pig manure could fertilize 5.4 million mu of land.

In the past, distilleries did not pay attention to the utilization of distillers' grains, and most distilleries sold them to farmers as they were produced. They often suffered losses in the summer due to spoilage. Now, in addition to being used as feed for animal husbandry, various regions are also studying how to more widely utilize distillers' grains to process mixed feed. The Baoying Distillery in Jiangsu adds coarse and fine bran, eggshell powder, and salt to the distillers' grains, which can more than double the output of mixed feed, and the feeding method is very simple. Feeding pigs with this feed, generally large pigs can gain an average of 1.5 to 1.6 jin of meat per day. Land fertilized with pig manure can increase grain yield by 200 jin per mu.

Some regions also use distillers' grains to make koji. Shandong, Henan, and Tianjin have created relatively mature experiences. Various regions are also further studying the use of distillers' grains to make vinegar. The vinegar made from distillers' grains by the Wuzhai Distillery in Shanxi and the distillers’ grains vinegar tested by the Wenzhou Industrial Laboratory in Zhejiang are of very good quality.

In foreign countries, distillers' grains are also used to manufacture glue and industrial products such as potassium salts and carbon powder. The utilization of molasses alcohol distillers' grains is still insufficient. It can be used as edible or feed yeast, etc. These need to be further researched and trial-produced.

### 支援农牧业的好东西——酒糟

    支援农牧业的好东西——酒糟
    酒糟是酿酒工业的废料，去年全国酿酒工业生产的酒糟，可以供给二百七十万头猪吃一年，猪粪可肥田五百四十万亩。
    过去酒厂不注意利用酒糟，许多酒厂大多是随生产随把酒糟出卖给农民。夏季常常因霉坏遭到损失。现在除大部分做为畜牧业的饲料，各地还研究怎样更广泛地利用酒糟加工成混合饲料。江苏宝应酒厂在酒糟中加进粗、细糠和蛋壳粉、食盐等可以使混合饲料的产量增加一倍多，而且饲喂的方法很简便。用这种饲料喂猪，一般大猪平均每天可以增肉一斤五两到一斤六两。用猪粪施肥的土地，每亩粮食产量可以提高二百斤。
    有些地区还利用酒糟制粬，山东、河南、天津已创造了比较成熟的经验。各地还进一步研究用酒糟制醋，山西五寨酒厂用酒糟制成的醋及浙江温州工业试验室所试验的糟醋，质量很好。
    在国外还有用酒糟制造胶糊和制钾盐、碳粉等工业产品；糖蜜酒精的酒糟现在利用得还不够，它可以做食用或饲用酵母等，这些都要进一步研究试制。
