Xinhua News Agency, New York, 7th. American bourgeois newspapers and economists continue to express concern about the development of the American economic crisis.

According to the "New York Times," at a joint meeting held by the Congressional Economic Committees of both houses at the end of April, six of the eight economists who testified expressed concern about the economic outlook, believing that the crisis would further develop in the coming period. V. Lewis Bassie, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Illinois, said that the American economic crisis "may last for several years," and "even if it stabilizes soon, it will plunge again if the government does not take more forceful measures, and even with these forceful measures, it is not very certain whether the United States can avoid a serious depression."

Jules Backman, chief economist of the National Industrial Conference Board, said that the trend of decreasing US business investment appears to be continuing into 1959, and that at the beginning of next year, the number of unemployed will be at least as high as it is now.

According to a recent survey of 25,000 families conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private research organization in the United States, published in the May 9th issue of "U.S. News & World Report" magazine (pre-publication), many families expect business conditions to worsen and plan to buy fewer things. The survey said that in the next six months, these 25,000 families will buy 20% fewer new cars than they did from October last year to early April this year, and more than 10% fewer household goods. Only one-third of these families believe that the current time is a "good time" to buy things, while the rest believe it is a "bad time."

Due to the worsening sales prospects, the total value of orders received by American factories continues to decline. In January of this year, the total value of orders was $24.4 billion, falling to $24.1 billion in February, and further to $23.9 billion in March. Old factory orders decreased from $47.8 billion in February to $46.6 billion.

American industrial production is also continuing to decline. According to American newspapers, from January 1 to May 6 of this year, American automobile production decreased by about 34% compared to the same period last year. In the week ending April 27, automobile production was even less than half of that of the same week last year. More than half of the nation's steel mills remain idle.

    美国危机症还会再拖下去
    资产阶级经济学家对前景悲观
    据新华社7日讯　纽约消息：美国资产阶级报刊和经济学家继续对美国经济危机的发展表示不安。
    据“纽约时报”报道，国会两院经济委员会在4月底举行了一个联席会议，在会上作证的八名经济学家中就有六名对经济前景表示忧虑，他们认为在今后一个时期内，危机还会进一步发展。伊利诺斯大学经济和商业研究所所长巴塞说，美国的经济危机“可能持续好几年”，“即使不久能平稳下来，如果政府没有更多有力措施，以后又将重新暴跌，而且即使有这些有力措施，美国是否能够避免一次严重的萧条也是没有很大把握的”。
    全国工业会议委员会首席经济学家根斯布鲁说，看来美国企业投资减少的趋势将要继续到1959年，在明年年初，失业人数最少将和现在一样多。
    据5月9日提前出版的一期“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志报道，美国私人研究机关“全国经济研究局”最近曾经对二万五千个家庭进行了调查，看看公众对经济前景有什么看法，结果发现许多家庭都预料企业情况会进一步坏下去，并且计划不多买东西。这个调查说，在今后六个月内，这两万五千个家庭购买新汽车的数目将比去年10月到今年4月初的时期减少20％，购买家庭用品的数目也将减少10％以上。这些家庭只有三分之一认为目前是买东西的“好时机”，其余都认为是“坏时机”。
    由于销售前景的恶化，美国工厂接到的订货单总值继续下降。在今年1月份，订货单总值是二百四十四亿美元，2月份降至二百四十一亿美元，3月份再降至二百三十九亿美元。工厂旧订货单从2月份的四百七十八亿美元减至四百六十六亿美元。
    美国工业生产也在继续下降中。据美国报刊报道，在从今年1月1日到5月6日这一期间，美国汽车产量比去年同期减少了约34％，在4月27日结束的一个星期内，汽车生产甚至不到去年同周的二分之一。全国钢铁工厂目前仍然有二分之一以上没有开工。
