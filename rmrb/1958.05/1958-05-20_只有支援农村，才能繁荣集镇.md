Only by Supporting the Countryside Can We Prosper Market Towns

Liao Zhuozhi, Second Secretary of the CPC Nantong Prefectural Committee, Jiangsu Province

Market towns are the political, economic, and cultural centers of the countryside, and have an inseparable relationship with the rural areas. Giving full play to the initiative of rural market towns is of great significance for supporting the countryside in realizing the Forty Articles Program. Take Baipu Town in Rugao County as an example: the whole town has 1,354 households and 5,867 people, with six small factories producing oil, rice, wine, soy sauce, and printing, etc.; and four handicraft cooperatives for iron and wood bamboo, hardware, sewing, and knitting; and 22 economic and cultural units such as banks, taxation, supply and marketing, grain, and primary and secondary schools, culture and health. This town directly serves about 100,000 people in the surrounding five townships and ninety agricultural cooperatives.

**Estranged Township Relations Hinder the Potential of Market Towns**

Baipu Town has great potential and good conditions. However, before the rectification campaign, due to the lack of clarity in the direction of facing the countryside and serving agriculture; some cadres and the masses looked down on the countryside and agricultural production. Therefore, there was estrangement in township relations, and the potential of the market town could not be fully realized. With the in-depth development of the rectification movement, the cadres and the masses of Baipu Town, through airing views and debates, criticized the bourgeois viewpoints that belittled the countryside and agricultural production; conducted recollection and comparison, and thus realized that when agriculture has a bumper harvest, the market town economy will prosper and work will be proactive; when agriculture has a poor harvest, production will decline, materials will be overstocked, and work will be passive; and clarified that only with the development of agriculture can the market town achieve further prosperity and development.

**Everyone Contributes to Serving the Countryside**

After clarifying the direction that all work in the market town must face the countryside and serve agricultural production, under the slogan of "Everyone contributes to supporting agriculture" and "Thousands of catties of grain and hundreds of catties of cotton are the farmers' goals, and also the goals of the market town people," the whole town launched a movement of digging mud and accumulating fertilizer with thousands of carts and ten thousands of loads. The whole town organized 26 voluntary labor activities, with the number of participants accounting for 60% of the town's adults, helping nearby farmers to build 32,000 cubic meters of water conservancy facilities and accumulate more than 1.234 million loads of fertilizer. The more important gain was that in the joint labor with the peasants, the people of the market town, through challenge competitions, mutual reporting of good news, and joint discussion meetings, eliminated some estrangement between the townships, strengthened mutual feelings, and changed the social atmosphere of belittling the countryside and agricultural production among the people of the market town, laying a preliminary ideological foundation for comprehensively supporting agriculture.

Although the direction was clear and a large-scale mud-digging and fertilizer accumulation movement had been launched, how various industries in the market town could serve agriculture had not been resolved. The Baipu Town Party Committee seized the opportunity to continue to use rectification as the key, organizing various industries to carry out a major debate on supporting agriculture and conduct a major ideological exchange. In the debate, the industrial, handicraft, commercial, cultural, educational, and health departments of the market town all focused on exposing and criticizing the various outdated rules and regulations in business that were divorced from agriculture and independently developing departmental business; only caring about departments and not farmers; and various ideological styles such as capitalism and departmentalism that did not cooperate and pulled each other back. This paved the way for adjusting township relations, further clarifying ideological obstacles, and supporting agriculture to prosper the market town.

**Supporting Agriculture Has Great Potential**

After this major debate, a new situation emerged in the production and various tasks of the market town. Factories and handicraft cooperatives previously believed that supporting agriculture was limited to voluntary labor, but now they find that there is much to be done. For example, the soy sauce factory uses snails, small fish, and small shrimps to make soy sauce, and the winery uses rice straw, bran, and rice lees to make wine, which saves grain and increases the farmers' sideline income. Handicraft cooperatives manufacture and reform various farm tools, which farmers are very satisfied with, calling the handicraft cooperatives "our arsenal." Transportation workers give priority to transporting means of production, reduce labor costs, and do so regardless of wind or rain. The postal and telecommunications departments changed their working hours and delivered registered letters and remittances to people's homes, saving farmers 3,600 working days throughout the year; newspaper distribution ensured that county newspapers arrived at cooperatives on the same day and provincial newspapers arrived at townships on the same day; commercial departments changed their past capitalist business ideas of "four dos and four don'ts" (doing what makes money, not doing what doesn't; doing what has high profits, not doing what has low profits; doing what sells well, not doing what doesn't; doing large varieties, not doing small varieties), actively improved service attitudes, and transferred personnel to extend their business downwards, ensuring that every township has a supply and marketing station, every cooperative has a service department, and every team has a mobile peddler; delivering goods to the countryside, purchasing from door to door, making verbal appointments, and delivering goods on time; dispersing business during the day and concentrating sales at night. Farmers reflected: "This is what a socialist store should be like." Banks also provide door-to-door deposit and payment services. Tax offices actively help agricultural cooperatives find raw materials and open up sales channels, which not only supports the development of sideline businesses but also opens up tax sources. Farmers praise them as: "Sideline cadres of agricultural cooperatives." The cultural, educational, and health departments previously believed that supporting agriculture had nothing to do with them, but now school teachers are combining with old farmers to plant experimental fields, bringing cultural technology to the countryside, and combining with experimental work to cultivate excellent breeds of poultry and livestock, promoting them to agricultural cooperatives; the health department changed the medical hours, providing medical treatment as soon as patients arrive, and also bringing medicine to the countryside, providing on-site diagnosis and treatment, which is convenient for farmers.

**Market Towns Further Prosper**

The result of the market town's full support for agriculture will inevitably promote the further prosperity and development of the market town itself. The small-scale industry of Baipu Town will have a great development this year. The whole town will expand and build twelve factories, producing more than ten new products such as seeders, cotton stalk peeling machines, slicers, and sprayers; the oil, rice, and soy sauce factories actively cooperate, processing 48 million catties of feed for farmers throughout the year, and making mixed feed from the by-products of the three factories, producing 12,000 catties per day. The supply and marketing cooperative trained 300 new farm tool experts and pesticide application experts for agricultural cooperatives, helped agricultural cooperatives build 90 granular fertilizer processing plants, and signed combination contracts with agricultural cooperatives, increasing the supply and marketing value by more than double compared to last year. From January to September this year, the bank's deposits increased by 359% compared to the same period last year. The tax office's tax revenue in the first quarter of this year increased from 100,000 yuan in the same period last year to 15.9%, basically achieving "no tax evasion, no errors, and no arrears." With the support of the masses, the health center also established a people's hospital in four days. All of this vividly proves that under the guidance of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results," the people of Baipu Town have given full play to their potential in order to realize the Forty Articles Program for agricultural development ahead of schedule.

The practice of Baipu Town proves that the rectification movement has enabled the people of the whole town to carry forward communist ideology, innovate the people's spiritual outlook, gradually eliminate the estrangement between townships, adjust the relationship between the people of the market town and the farmers, and clearly establish the direction that only by fully supporting agriculture can the market town achieve prosperity and development. Therefore, the face of the market town's work has undergone fundamental changes, and production and various economic and cultural undertakings have achieved leapfrog development.

### 只有支援农村，才能繁荣集镇

　　只有支援农村，才能繁荣集镇
　　中共江苏省南通地委第二书记　廖卓之
    集镇是农村的政治、经济、文化中心，与农村有着血肉不可分的关系。充分发挥农村集镇的积极性，对支援农村实现四十条纲要有着十分重要的意义。以如?县白蒲镇来说，全镇有一千三百五十四户、五千八百六十七人，有油、米、酒、酱醋、印刷等六个小型工厂，铁木竹、五金、缝纫、针织等四个手工业社；有银行、税务、供销、粮食和中小学、文化卫生等二十二个经济文化单位。这个镇直接为周围的五个乡，九十个农业社，约十万人口服务。
    乡镇关系隔阂集镇潜力不能发挥
    白蒲镇的潜力很大，条件很好。但是，在整风运动之前，由于对面向农村，为农业服务的方向不够明确；一部分干部和群众轻视农村、轻视农业生产，因此乡镇关系上有隔阂，集镇的潜力没有能充分的发挥。随着整风运动的深入展开，白蒲镇的干部和群众，通过鸣放辩论，批判了轻视农村、轻视农业生产的资产阶级观点；进行了回忆对比，从而认识了农业丰收，集镇经济就繁荣，工作就主动；农业欠收，生产就下降，物资就积压，工作就被动；明确了只有农业发展，集镇才能得到进一步繁荣和发展。
    人人出力　面向农村
    明确了集镇一切工作必须面向农村，为农业生产服务的方向之后，全镇人民在“人人出力，支援农业”，“千斤粮百斤棉是农民的奋斗目标，也是集镇人民的奋斗目标”的口号下，掀起了一个千车万担挖泥积肥运动。全镇先后组织了二十六次义务劳动，参加劳动的人数占全镇成年人的60％，帮助附近农民兴修水利三万二千方，积肥一百二十三万四千多担。更重要的收获是集镇人民在和农民共同劳动中，通过挑战竞赛，互相报喜、联欢座谈，消除了乡镇之间的某些隔阂，密切了相互之间的感情，转变了集镇人民中轻视农村、轻视农业生产的社会风气，为全面支援农业打下了初步的思想基础。
    方向虽然明确了，一个声势浩大的挖泥积肥运动虽然展开了，但是，集镇各行各业如何为农业服务，并没有得到解决。白蒲镇党委抓住时机，继续以整风为纲，组织各行各业开展支援农业的大辩论，进行思想大交锋。在辩论中，集镇工业、手工业、商业、文教卫生等各个部门，都集中地揭发和批判了脱离农业、独立地发展部门业务；只顾部门、不顾农民的各种业务上的陈规陋矩；互不协作、互相扯皮的资本主义、本位主义等各种各样思想作风，从而为调整乡镇关系，进一步搞清了思想障碍，为支援农业繁荣集镇铺平了道路。
    支援农业　大有可为
    经过这场大辩论之后，集镇的生产和各项工作出现了崭新的局面。工厂和手工业社过去认为支援农业除了搞义务劳动外，别无其它门路，现在却大有可为了。例如：酱醋厂以螺儿、小鱼、小虾制造酱油，酒厂以稻草、皮糠、米糟制酒，既节省了粮食，又增加了农民的副业收入。手工业社制造和改革各种农具，农民非常满意，称手工业社是“我们的兵工厂”。搬运工人优先搬运生产资料，降低力资，而且做到风雨无阻。邮电部门改变了作息制度，上门递送挂号信和汇款，全年可为农民节省三千六百个劳动日；报纸发行做到县报当日到社、省报当日到乡，商业部门改变了过去“四干四不干”（赚钱的干，不赚钱的不干；利润大的干，利润小的不干；畅销货干，不畅销货不干；大品种干，小品种不干）的资本主义经营思想，积极改进了服务态度，而且抽调人员，业务下伸，做到乡乡有供销站，社社有服务部，队队有流动货郎担；送货下乡，登门收购，口头预约，定时送货；白天分散营业，晚上集中买卖。农民反映：“这才像个社会主义的商店。”银行也做到上门存付。税务所积极帮助农业社寻找原料，打开销路，既扶助了副业发展，又开辟了税源，农民称赞他们是：“农业社的副业干部”。文教卫生部门过去认为支援农业与己无关，现在学校老师和老农结合种试验田，把文化技术带下乡去，并结合实验工作，培育家禽家畜的优良品种，向农业社推广；卫生部改变了医疗时间，随到随诊，而且带药下乡，就地诊疗，方便农民。
    集镇进一步繁荣
    集镇全力支援农业的结果，必然促使集镇本身的进一步繁荣和发展。白蒲镇的小型工业，今年将有一个很大的发展，全镇将扩建和新建十二个工厂，生产播种机、纺棉秸皮机、切片机、喷雾机等十多种新产品；油、米、酱醋三个厂主动协作，全年为农民加工饲料四千八百万斤，并将三个厂的副产品制成混合饲料，每天生产一万二千斤。供销社为农业社训练了新农具能手和农药使用能手三百人，帮助农业社建成九十个颗粒肥料加工场，和农业社签订了结合合同，使供销价值比去年增加一倍以上。银行今年1月到9月的存款，比去年同期上升359％。税务所今年一季度的税款入库，从去年同期的十万元，上升到15.9％，基本上做到了“无偷漏、无差错、无滞纳”。卫生所也在群众支援下，四天中建立了一所人民医院。所有这一切，生动地证明了，白蒲镇人民在“鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”这条总路线的指引下，为提前实现农业发展纲要四十条的任务，充分发挥了潜力。
    白蒲镇的实践证明：整风运动使全镇人民发扬了共产主义思想，革新了人民的精神面貌，逐步消除了乡镇的隔阂，调整了集镇人民和农民的关系，明确地树立了只有全力支援农业，才能使集镇得到繁荣和发展的方向，因此，集镇工作的面貌发生了根本变化，生产和各项经济文化事业都获得了飞跃的发展。
