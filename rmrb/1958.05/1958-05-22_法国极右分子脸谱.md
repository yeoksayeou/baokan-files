Faces of French Right-Wingers

    De Gaulle
    The now sixty-eight-year-old De Gaulle is the central figure whom French fascists are trying to enthrone. After being rejected by the French people in 1946 and withdrawing from the political stage, he still frequently spied on the French political situation, looking for opportunities to come to power. Comrade Duclos, secretary of the French Communist Party, once pointed out: "This guy who demands to be a dictator wants to turn France into a huge barracks, making the people listen to the commands of his corporals." Comrade Duclos said: De Gaulle himself is fascism.
    Before World War II, De Gaulle was a colonel in the French army. During the war, when the German army captured Paris, he fled to London and organized "Free France." But this exiled politician who fled abroad styled himself as "the first French resister." How he "resisted" the German army in London is laughable. As "l'Humanité" pointed out: For four whole years, De Gaulle posed as the leader of the French resistance; in fact, he tried every means to prevent the French people's liberation struggle, fearing that the French people would liberate themselves and establish a France that was not to his liking. For example, the volunteers in the Vercors mountains in France were destroyed by the enemy due to De Gaulle's abandonment and betrayal. In order to prevent the people's anti-German armed forces from recovering Paris, this "first resister" even advocated concluding an armistice with Germany.
    After the war, De Gaulle returned to Paris and served as chairman of the "provisional government," and later as prime minister, minister of defense, and minister of the army. He tried his best to strengthen the reactionary forces and attempted to establish a military dictatorship. He disbanded the people's anti-German armed forces, reorganized and strengthened the secret police force, and carried out large-scale persecution of democratic forces.
    In January 1946, De Gaulle was forced to resign due to the fierce opposition of the French people.
    However, De Gaulle never stopped his reactionary activities. In 1947, he pieced together a reactionary grand alliance under the banner of the Rally of the French People (which was renamed the Social Republican Party in 1954), trying to bring all right-wing forces, including rioters and agents of financial groups, under his banner.
    In recent years, although De Gaulle has "retired" to the countryside, he goes to Paris for activities almost every week. He has become the leader of the French extreme right wing and also the instigator and guide of the conspiracy carried out by the rebels in Algeria.
    De Gaulle is a man of the two hundred families of French monopoly capitalists. His party and activities have always been subsidized and supported by domestic and foreign financial groups. Many of his relatives and friends are connected with French monopoly capital, and his brother, Pierre de Gaulle, is an agent of the Banque de l'Union Parisienne.

    Salan
    Raoul Salan, the commander-in-chief of the French invading army in Algeria, is a veteran war criminal engaged in colonial warfare. In this French riot, he participated in and encouraged the activities of the rioters, clamoring to continue the aggressive war in Algeria, and shouting the reactionary slogan "Long live De Gaulle." He even shamelessly issued an order saying: "Since I am the only one who understands the current situation, only I can take the decisions needed to complete my mission."
    Salan, who graduated from the French Saint-Cyr Military Academy, was a defeated general under the Vietnamese people. In January 1952, he was promoted from commander of the French army in North Vietnam to commander-in-chief of the French army in Indochina. At this time, the Vietnamese People's Army launched three victorious offensives. In late February, they liberated Hoa Binh in North Vietnam, annihilating 22,000 French troops. Since then, under the strong blows of the Vietnamese People's Army, the French colonial army under Salan's command has been constantly subjected to heavy defeats. In May 1953, the French government removed him from his post and transferred him back to France to serve as Inspector General of the Army. At the end of 1956, this executioner who massacred the colonial people was appointed commander-in-chief of the French army in Algeria. As the Algerian people became stronger and stronger in battle, Salan has suffered a lot in the past year or so, and is often in a very embarrassing situation. (Xinhua News Agency)

    法国极右分子脸谱
    戴高乐
    现已六十八岁的戴高乐是法国法西斯分子力图拥戴上台的中心人物。他在1946年被法国人民唾弃，退出政治舞台以后，仍然经常窥伺法国政局，寻找上台的机会。法国共产党书记杜克洛同志曾经指出：“这位要求作独裁者的家伙想把法国变成一个巨大的兵营，使人民都听从他的伍长们的指挥。”杜克洛同志说：戴高乐本身就是法西斯主义。
    在第二次世界大战以前，戴高乐是法国军队里的一名上校，大战期间，德军攻下巴黎，他逃到伦敦，组织“自由法国”。但这位逃避到外国的流亡政客却自封为“法国第一个抵抗者”。他如何在伦敦“抵抗”德军，岂不叫人啼笑皆非。正如“人道报”所指出：整整四年之久，戴高乐冒充为法国抗战的领袖；其实他想尽了办法阻止法国人民的解放斗争，害怕法国人民自己解放自己并建立一个同他气味不相投的法国。例如，在法国凡谷尔山地的义勇军，就是由于戴高乐的遗弃和出卖，而被敌人消灭的。为了阻止人民抗德武装收复巴黎，这位“第一个抵抗者”甚至主张同德国订立休战协定。
    大战结束后，戴高乐回到巴黎，担任“临时政府”主席，以后又担任内阁总理兼国防部长和陆军部长。他尽力加强反动势力，图谋建立军事独裁统治。他解散了人民的抗德武装，改组和加强了秘密警察部队，对民主力量实行大迫害。
    1946年1月，戴高乐遭到法国人民的激烈反对而被迫辞职。
    但是，戴高乐一刻也未停止反动活动，他在1947年以法兰西人民联盟（它在1954年改名为社会共和党）为招牌，拼凑了一个反动大联合，想把所有右派力量，包括暴乱分子和财阀代理人，都集合在他的旗号下。
    近年来，戴高乐虽然“退居”在乡下，可是几乎每星期他都到巴黎去活动。他成为法国极右分子的领袖，也是叛乱分子在阿尔及利亚进行的阴谋的鼓动者和指导者。
    戴高乐是法国垄断资本家二百家族的人。他的政党和活动历来受到国内外财阀的津贴和支持。他的许多亲友都和法国垄断资本有联系，他的兄弟比尔·戴高乐是巴黎联合银行的代理人。
    萨兰
    法国驻阿尔及利亚的侵略军总司令拉乌尔·萨兰是从事殖民战争的老牌战犯。在这次法国暴乱事件中，他参与和鼓励暴乱分子的活动，叫嚣要在阿尔及利亚继续进行侵略战争，并且高呼“戴高乐万岁”的反动口号。他甚至无耻地颁布命令说：“由于只有我一人了解目前的局势，因此只有我能够采取完成我的使命所需要的决定。”
    曾在法国圣西尔军校毕业的萨兰是越南人民手下的败将。1952年1月，他从北越法军司令升任印度支那法军总司令。正在此时，越南人民军发动了三次胜利的攻势。在2月下旬解放了北越的和平城，全歼法军二万二千名。此后，萨兰指挥下的法国殖民军，在越南人民军的有力打击下，不断地遭受到惨重的挫败。1953年5月，法国政府把他撤职调回法国担任陆军总监的职务。1956年底，这位屠杀殖民地人民的刽子手又被任命为阿尔及利亚的法军总司令。由于阿尔及利亚人民愈战愈强，年余以来，萨兰又吃到不少的苦头，经常处于十分狼狈的境地。　　　（新华社）
