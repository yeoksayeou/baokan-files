Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 21st: Shanghai State-owned Cotton Mill No. 12 employees recently posted nearly 20,000 big-character posters to review and summarize the achievements of the rectification movement over the past year, celebrating the harvest of the rectification. The content of the big-character posters includes praise, suggestions, and criticisms; the forms include charts, cartoons, poems, and even physical objects such as superior-grade yarn and rayon fabrics that the factory had not produced in the past. The employees said that this was a major inspection of the rectification movement and also a major competition among all the factory employees, and they expressed their determination to make another effort to carry the rectification movement through to the end.

Mill No. 12 was originally a relatively backward factory among the state-owned cotton textile factories in Shanghai. Around the Spring Festival this year, all the factory employees, with the force of a thunderbolt, posted 50,000 to 60,000 big-character posters in two or three days, fiercely burning the three winds and five airs and backward conservative thinking among leaders and cadres, taking the lead in the double-anti movement of more than 10,000 factories in the city. For the past three months, the entire factory has been working hard, with many workers arriving at the factory early and leaving late to repair machines. The factory director, Party committee secretary, and main engineering and technical personnel have all moved to the factory to live, working and laboring alongside the workers day and night, planting "experimental fields" in workshops and sections, and studying key production issues. In this way, the entire factory achieved the plan of "working hard for a year to change the backward situation" ahead of schedule. In April, the factory's production of superior-grade yarn jumped to first place among the city's fifty-six cotton textile factories; the factory's four main production indicators of output, quality, cost, and cotton consumption have basically caught up with or exceeded the advanced State-owned Cotton Mill No. 1. In this inspection and summary of the rectification achievements, the workers also put forward new goals: "Make another effort to catch up with the advanced domestic level before October 1st, and present a gift to the National Day!"

The employees enthusiastically praised the factory's rapid progress with big-character posters. One big-character poster wrote: "A thunderclap on the ground awakens Mill No. 12, backwardness becomes advanced, do not forget the Communist Party." It also said: "Double-Anti is good, Double-Anti is wonderful, the Double-Anti fire burns away the backwardness of our factory."

Tens of thousands of big-character posters prominently illustrate that the more important gain in the rectification movement is the great leap forward in people's thinking and the great promotion of the communist spirit. About 60 to 70 percent of the big-character posters talk about this gratifying scene. One big-character poster said: "In the past, some people would inquire about bonuses when they made rationalization proposals; since the rectification, there have been many technical innovations, but no one has paid attention to bonuses." Several big-character posters praised Tao Zhenyu, a worker in the iron workshop, because he had not rested for many Sundays in a row in order to cooperate with the factory's production of superior-grade yarn and trial production of bearing spindles. The big-character posters also introduced the following vivid example: a female spinner in the first spinning workshop has very good yarn joining skills. In the past, she was unwilling to teach others, fearing that she would not be rated as an advanced producer after others improved. After the rectification, she realized that doing a good job cannot rely on one person. Now, she is performing and teaching yarn joining skills everywhere. Many employees asked the Party committee secretary in big-character posters not to just bury himself in the "experimental field" to develop superior-grade yarn, but also to help them improve their ideological level.

Using big-character posters to inspect the rectification movement and extensively praising advanced individuals has actually promoted the in-depth development of the factory employees' movement to compare ideology and compare advanced individuals. Those who have been praised feel encouraged, and those who have not been praised also feel hopeful.

Because Mill No. 12 has adopted the method of freely mobilizing the masses to write big-character posters and freely air their views from beginning to end to carry out the rectification, a political situation in which everyone is happy and lively has begun to form in the entire factory. Big-character posters have become the most widely used and most proficient tool for the factory employees to promote democracy. "Post a big-character poster for him!" has become a catchphrase among employees for praising the advanced and criticizing the backward. Some workers told the leading cadres: "You don't need to tell us whether the cadres are good or not, just look at our big-character posters."

### 双反好　双反妙　双反之火烧掉落后貌  两万张大字报总结整风成果 上海国棉十二厂职工决心把整风进行到底

    双反好　双反妙　双反之火烧掉落后貌
    两万张大字报总结整风成果 　 上海国棉十二厂职工决心把整风进行到底
    新华社上海21日电　上海国棉十二厂职工近日贴出近两万张大字报，检查总结一年来整风运动的成果，欢庆整风丰收。大字报的内容有表扬，有建议，也有批评；形式有图表、漫画、诗歌，还有厂里过去没有生产过的优级纱和人造棉织物等实物。职工们说这是一次整风运动的大检查，也是全厂职工的大评比，纷纷表示要再加一把劲，把整风运动进行到底。
    十二厂原是上海国营棉纺织厂中生产比较落后的厂。今年春节前后，全厂职工曾以雷霆万钧之势，在两三天内贴了五六万张大字报，猛烧领导和干部中间的三风五气和落后保守思想，在全市一万多工厂的双反运动中一马领先。三个月来，全厂上下苦钻苦干，很多工人起早带晚地来到厂里检修机器。厂长、党委书记和主要工程技术人员都搬到厂里去住，日夜和工人一起，跟班工作，跟班劳动，到车间、工段种“试验田”，研究生产关键问题。就这样，全厂提前实现了“苦战一年，改变落后面貌”的规划。4月份，全厂生产优级纱的数量在全市五十六个棉纺织厂中跃居第一；全厂的产量、质量、成本、用棉等四项主要生产指标，已经基本赶上或超过了先进的国棉一厂。这次检查和总结整风成果，工人们又提出了新的奋斗目标：“再加一把劲，争取10月1日以前赶上国内先进水平，向国庆节献礼！”
    职工们用大字报热情地赞扬这个厂的突飞猛进。有一张大字报写道：“平地一声雷，惊醒十二厂，落后变先进，不忘共产党。”又说：“双反好，双反妙，双反之火烧掉了我厂的落后貌。”
    上万张大字报突出地说明了整风运动中更重要的收获，是人的思想面貌的大跃进和共产主义精神的大发扬。大约有百分之六七十的大字报都谈到这方面的可喜景象。有一张大字报说：“以前有些人提了合理化建议，就要打听奖金多少；整风以来，有许多技术上的革新，却没有人去注意奖金了。”好几张大字报表扬了铁工间工人陶甄宇，因为他最近为了配合厂里生产优级纱和试制培林锭胆，一连好多个星期天没有休息。大字报还介绍了下面这个生动的事例：第一纺纱工场一个细纱女工的接头技术很好，过去她不肯教人，怕别人进步以后，她评不上先进生产者，整风以后，她认识到做好工作不能靠一个人，现在，她到处表演教人接头技术了。不少职工在大字报中要求党委书记不要只是钻在“试验田”里搞优级纱，还要帮助他们提高思想水平。
    用大字报检查整风运动，大量表扬先进的结果，实际上推动了全厂职工比思想、比先进运动的深入发展。受到表扬的人感到鼓舞，没有受到表扬的也觉得大有希望。
    十二厂因为自始至终采用放手发动群众写大字报、大鸣大放的方式进行整风，一个人人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面，已经在全厂开始形成。大字报已成为全厂职工运用最广泛、最熟练的发扬民主的工具。“给他贴张大字报！”已成为职工中表扬先进和批评落后的口头禅。有的工人告诉领导干部：“干部好不好不需你们讲，看看我们的大字报就知道了。”
