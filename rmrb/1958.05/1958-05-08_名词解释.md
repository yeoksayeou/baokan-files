Glossary of Terms

	"Rotational Fallowing and Green Manuring" refers to a planned practice of leaving a portion of land fallow for a year. When the weeds have grown to the point of nearly seeding, they are plowed into the ground as green manure, and the land is sown the following year. Adopting this method can improve the soil, reduce water evaporation, and increase soil fertility without the need for fertilizers.

    名词解释
    “轮荒压青”就是有计划地使一部土地休闲一年，等杂草生长到快结籽时，用犁把它翻到地下当绿肥，来年播种。采取这种办法，不用施用肥料，就能改良土壤，减少水分蒸发，增加地力。
