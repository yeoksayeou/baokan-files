　　With the fire of passion, you light the lamp of life;
　　Like a lighthouse, you guard the long night.
                ——Dedicated to the Observation Post Sentry

    Corporal Liang Tianxiu is the squad leader of an observation post on a certain part of Sanmen Island. He joined the army in 1955, and from the first day of his enlistment, he was assigned to the mountain as a lookout sentry. For three whole years, he hadn't gone anywhere else, steadfastly guarding his post like a lighthouse.

    Last September, I spent a night with the observation post sentries on the towering Tuoning Mountain.

    That night the weather was bad, with wind and clouds shrouding the mountaintop, so the sentries had to go down to the mountainside to observe the sea.

    Liang Tianxiu is a man of few words. We sat facing each other for a long time without speaking. Later, I was the first to ask him about his life over the past three years. He thought for a moment and slowly said, "At first, I wasn't used to it. Standing on the mountaintop and looking out, there was nothing but the sea, and I felt a bit stifled. But later, it got better. Actually, there are many things to watch out for besides the sea, such as enemy warships, airplanes, and passing merchant ships... If they just pass by quickly, it's easy; you just report their direction and ship names. But sometimes, enemy ships just sit still far out at sea, and you don't know what they're up to. Then you have to keep a close eye on them without blinking. Sometimes, looking through the binoculars for too long makes my head spin..."

    "Can you tell where the ships are from, even if they're far away?" I asked.

    "Yes, they all come and go on this shipping lane. After seeing them many times, you can recognize them by their speed and shape. It's nothing special," he smiled and said, "It's like if I see you a few more times, I'll recognize you and be able to call out your name!"

    Look how simply he puts it, but it's not easy at all!

    I asked him, "Do you write home often?"

    "Not often."

    "Why?"

    "Our work is very ordinary, the same day and night, guarding, watching, there's nothing much to say."
    "Do you miss home?"

    "Yes, I miss it terribly as soon as I leave. Last year, when I went to the military region for two months of training, I couldn't sleep at night because I missed it so much!"

    "No, I mean your hometown, Guangxi..."

    "Ah, you mean—" he smiled and waved his hand:
    "I don't have time to think about it!"

    After another period of silence, I asked him if he had any opinions about life and work that I could pass on to the leaders.

    He thought for a long time and said, "According to regulations, I should be discharged this year. Please ask the leaders if I can continue to serve for another year..."

    As he said this, a senior private came to report: a merchant ship had stopped on the sea, with a red light and a green light hanging on its side.

    Liang Tianxiu immediately stood up and said, "The engine is broken. Alas, in this kind of weather, stopping at sea is really tough on the passengers!" He put on his coat and walked out of the guard post.

    Two hours later, Liang Tianxiu returned. He accurately reported to his superiors by telephone: "Merchant ship ××, stopped at 18:29 due to engine failure, 3,500 meters to the left front of my observation post... Yes! Watching over it, yes! Paying attention to its distress signals, yes! Ensuring its safety... Yes!" Hanging up the phone, he went out again.

    During the night, in my drowsy sleep, I heard Liang Tianxiu returning to make phone calls from time to time. He seemed to be afraid of disturbing me, and he tried to keep his voice down, but one sentence he said was quite loud: "Yes, we are watching over it!"

    At dawn, the wind stopped. Morning light streamed in through the open window. I opened my eyes and saw Liang Tianxiu leaning over the windowsill.

    "Has the merchant ship left?" I asked.

    "Yes, it's gone, look—" he said lightly.

    I saw on the blue sea a merchant ship trailing a band of gray smoke as it sailed westward into the distance.

    The sunlight shone on Liang Tianxiu's face, which was a little pale from lack of sleep, but his small eyes did not look tired, and he was still stubbornly watching the departing merchant ship.

    Oh, safely departing travelers, do you know that last night on the mountain of the island, a 'lighthouse' was shining for your safety?

                ——献给观察哨兵
    下士梁天修是三门岛某地观察哨的哨长。他1955年入伍，从入伍的第一天起，就被分配到山上来当了望哨兵。整整三年他那儿也没有去过，像座灯塔似的坚守在自己的岗位上。
    去年9月间，我在高耸的驼宁山上和观察哨兵们过了一夜。
    那一夜天气不好，刮着风，云雾弥漫着山巅，哨兵们要下到山腰去观察海面。
    梁天修是个沉默的人，我们相对坐着，很久都没有说话。后来，还是我先开口询问起他这三年的生活。他想了一下，慢慢地说：“开头有点不习惯，站在山头上一望，除了海水还是海水，心里有点发闷。可是后来就好了，其实除了海水之外要注意的东西多着哩，敌人的军舰啦，飞机啦，来往的商船啦……如果他们突突地过去了倒好，只要报告一下它们的来往方向、船名就可以了。但是，有时候敌舰却一动不动的停在远远的海面上，真不知它想搞什么鬼名堂；这样你就非得不眨眼地老瞧着它不行。有时老对着望远镜直看得头昏眼花……。”
    “离得很远也能辨出是哪里的船只吗？”我问。
    “能，它们都在这条航线上来去，看得多了，凭它的速度和轮廓就能认出来。这没有什么出奇的，”他笑了笑说：“就像我多看了你几回，就认得你，能喊出你的名字一样！”
    瞧他说得多简单，其实是多么不容易的事啊！
    我问他：“常给家里写信吗？”
    “很少。”
    “为什么？”
    “咱们这工作很平常，日夜都一样，守着，望着，没什么好说的。”“想家吗？”
    “想的，”他说：“一离开就想得厉害，去年到军分区学习两个月，夜里都想得睡不着觉！”
    “不，我是说你的老家，广西……”
    “嗳，你是说——”他微笑着摆了一下手：
    “没有时间想！”
    又沉默了一阵，我问他对生活和工作方面有些什么意见；好替他向首长转达。
    他想了很久说：“按规定今年我就要复员了，请你问问首长，我是不是可以继续服役一年……”
    话说到这里，一位上等兵来报告情况：一只商船在海面上停下了，船舷上挂着一盏红灯和一盏绿灯。
    梁天修马上站起来说：“机器坏了，唉，这样的天气，停在海上，旅客也真够受！”他披起大衣走出哨所。
    两个小时后，梁天修回来了。他用电话准确的向上级报告：“商船××号，十八时二十九分因机器故障，停在离我观察所左前方三千五百公尺的海面上……是！守望着，是！注意它的求援讯号，是！保障它的安全……是！”撂下电话，他又出去了。
    夜里，我在睡意朦胧中听见梁天修不时地回来打电话，他似乎怕惊扰我，尽力压低嗓子说话，只有一句他说得比较响亮：“是，我们守望着！”
    黎明，风停了。晨光从敞开的窗户射进来。我睁开眼，看见梁天修伏身在窗槛上。
    “商船走了吗？”我问道。
    “走了，走了，你看——”他轻松地说。
    我看见在碧兰的海面上，一只商船拖着一条带子般的灰烟向西远去了。
    阳光照在梁天修那因不眠而显得有点苍白的脸上，然而，他那双小小的眼睛并不显得疲倦，还在固执地望着远去的商船。
    平安地远去的旅人啊，你们知道昨夜在海岛的山上，有一个‘灯塔’在为你们的安全而照耀吗？
