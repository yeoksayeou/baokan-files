    Welcome Little White Cabbage
    Jiang Younong
    Spring and summer are the seasons when little white cabbage is abundantly available (in North China, there is also a peak season for little white cabbage in the autumn). Because it is inexpensive, many people look down on it and are unwilling to eat it.
    In fact, the nutrients in vegetables of the little white cabbage category are very good. First, the vitamin C content of little white cabbage is quite high. Approximately every 100 grams (equivalent to 3.2 taels) of the edible portion of little white cabbage contains dozens to 120-130 milligrams of vitamin C. If a person eats a few taels of little white cabbage per day, it will be enough to meet the body's need for vitamin C. Second, little white cabbage also contains a considerable amount of carotene. According to analyses of products from Beijing, Nanjing, Kaifeng, and other places, approximately every 100 grams of the edible portion contains more than 1 milligram of carotene. In addition, the content of vitamins such as vitamin B1, B2, and niacin, as well as minerals like calcium and iron, are also quite high in little white cabbage. Approximately every 100 grams of the edible portion contains 80-90 milligrams to 110-130 milligrams of calcium, and 1.1 to 3.1 milligrams of iron, which is more than many other leafy greens can provide.
    When cooking little white cabbage, be sure to use high heat, and stop heating it as soon as it is cooked. If you use low heat to cook it, and continue to stir-fry or boil it for a long time after it is cooked, the cabbage leaves will turn yellow and soft, and it will have no flavor.

    欢迎小白菜
    江幼农
    春夏两季是小白菜大量上市的时期（华北地区在秋天还有一次盛产小白菜的时期）。因为它价钱便宜，许多人因此看它不起，不愿意吃它。
    事实上，小白菜类的蔬菜养份却是很好的。首先，维生素丙的含量，小白菜类相当高。大概每一百克（合三点二市两）小白菜类蔬菜的可吃部分，含维生素丙几十到一百二、三十毫克。一个人一天吃几两小白菜类，身体里所需要的维生素丙就足够了。其次，小白菜类所含的葫萝卜素也相当多。根据对北京、南京、开封等地产品的分析，大概每一百克可吃部分含到葫萝卜素一点几毫克以上。此外，如维生素乙1、乙2、尼克酸等维生素，矿物质钙和铁等，小白菜类的含量也都相当高，大概每一百克可吃部分含钙八、九十毫克到一百几十毫克，铁有一点多到三点多毫克，这是不少叶菜类都比不上的。
    小白菜烹调时一定要用旺火，同时一熟就停止加热。如果用微火烹调，同时熟了还炒或再煮上半天，菜叶都黄软了，也就没有味儿了。
