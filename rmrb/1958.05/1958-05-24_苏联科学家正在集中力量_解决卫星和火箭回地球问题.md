Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 23rd: According to Soviet space travel expert Varvarov, in an interview with Xinhua reporter Li Nan, humanity's first expedition into outer space will likely not be a single rocket, but many rockets launching simultaneously. This is somewhat like the expeditions of Columbus and Magellan. Columbus's expedition consisted of three ships, and Magellan's expedition consisted of five. If they only had one ship, they would not have reached their destination. Multiple rockets can not only carry everything the expedition needs, but also ensure that if one rocket is damaged along the way, the others can still reach the destination.

Varvarov is the Director of the Cosmonautics Department of the Soviet Volunteer Society for Assistance to the Army, Navy, and Air Force. He said that before humans can actually engage in space flight, it is necessary to first solve the problem of returning artificial satellites and rockets to Earth. Soviet scientists are now concentrating their efforts on solving this important and key issue.

Varvarov said that with the current level of technology, reaching the Moon is entirely possible. However, solving the problem of rockets returning is still quite complex. Calculations show that a rocket of the current level, flying to the Moon and back to Earth, needs to carry fuel three thousand times its actual weight. Building such a rocket is obviously impossible. Therefore, to solve the problem of launching rockets to and from the Moon, it is necessary to simultaneously solve the problem of building automatically controlled rockets and using artificial satellites as intermediate refueling stations.

Varvarov said that if atomic rockets can be successfully manufactured, then there would be no need for intermediate stations to go to the Moon.

    苏联科学家正在集中力量  解决卫星和火箭回地球问题
    据新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联著名星际交通专家瓦尔瓦罗夫对新华社记者李楠说，人类进入宇宙空间的第一支探险队，大概不会是单独的一个火箭，而是许多个火箭同时出发。这有点像当年哥伦布和麦哲伦的探险队。哥伦布的探险队由三艘船组成，麦哲伦的探险队由五艘船组成。如果他们只有一艘船，那就不会到达目的。许多个火箭不仅能够装载探险队所需要的一切，并且万一有一个火箭中途损坏，利用其余的火箭还可以到达目的地。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫是苏联支援陆海空军志愿协会宇宙飞行部主任。他说，在人类实际从事宇宙飞行以前，必须首先解决使人造卫星和火箭回到地球上来的问题。现在苏联科学家正在集中力量解决这一重要关键问题。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫说，就现有的技术水平来说，到达月球已经是完全可能的了。但是，解决火箭回来的问题，还是相当复杂的。计算证明，现代水平的火箭飞到月球再回到地球上来，需要带三千倍于火箭实际重量的燃料。要造这样的火箭显然是不可能的。因此，要解决发射火箭往返月球的问题，必须同时解决建造自动操纵的火箭和用人造卫星作中途燃料站的问题。
    瓦尔瓦罗夫说，如果原子能火箭能够制造成功，那么到月亮去就不需要中途站了。
