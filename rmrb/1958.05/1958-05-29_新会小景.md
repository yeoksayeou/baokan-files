    Small Scenes of Xinhui
    Poetry by Han Beiping, Painting by Yu Feng
    Street Scene
    There are no idle people in Xinhui City,
    When it's time for work, the streets are quiet;
    When school is out, the children carry their satchels,
    Looking carefully as they walk;
    Their nimble hands weave patterns of sunflower leaves,
    As agile as jumping little birds.
    The woven patterns become delicate flower baskets,
    Flower baskets filled with the laughter of youth.
    I want to call out: Hello, children,
    And want to touch the ends of their small braids.

    新会小景
    韩北屏诗  郁风画
    街头
    新会城里没有闲人，
    上工时大街上静悄悄；
    放学了，孩子们背着书包，
    一边走着一边仔细地瞧；
    双手编织葵叶的花边，
    灵巧得如跳跃的小鸟。
    花边编成精致的花篮，
    花篮里装着青春的欢笑。
    我想叫一声：孩子们好，
    也想摸一摸她们的小辫梢。
