Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 11th: The Inner Mongolia Daily published today on its front page a report on the successful trial use of cow and horse manure as pig and sheep feed by the Peach Blossom Agricultural Cooperative in Tumote Banner. It also published an editorial entitled "A Golden Key," calling for the promotion of this advanced experience throughout the autonomous region.

The Peach Blossom Agricultural Cooperative is a large cooperative of thousands of households composed of farmers from Mongolian, Han, and Manchu ethnic groups, located near Hohhot. In early April, members were very excited to read newspaper reports about Heshan County in Guangdong Province using cow manure to feed pigs. They began to experiment with making feed from cow and horse manure to feed pigs and sheep, with assistance from the Inner Mongolia Institute of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Science. After about twenty days of experimentation, they finally succeeded. The feed made from cow and horse manure was used to feed five pigs, and on average, each pig gained twenty-one *jin* of meat in eleven days. A female goat fed with cow and horse manure feed also gained five *jin* of fat in four days.

The method used by the Peach Blossom Cooperative to make pig and sheep feed from cow and horse manure is simple and easy to implement: First, the cow or horse manure is soaked in clean water and washed. Then, it is taken out and boiled in a pot to evaporate the fishy smell. Some ensiled beet leaves, potato pulp, wheat bran, and a little salt are added and cooked together. After taking it out and cooling it, it can be fed to pigs and sheep. The approximate ratio of various feeds (based on the amount of food for two days for a pig weighing sixty to seventy *jin*) is: eight and a half *jin* of cow or horse manure, four *jin* of ensiled beet leaves, two *jin* of potato pulp, one and a half *jin* of bran, one *liang* of salt, and more than ten *jin* of water (the amount of cow and horse manure can be smaller at the beginning and gradually increased later). The feed ratio and preparation method for feeding sheep are the same as before, but the cooking time can be shorter. According to tests, cow and horse manure contains various proteins, fats, and carbohydrates needed by pigs and sheep.

The Inner Mongolia Daily editorial pointed out that Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has about 3.8 million cattle and more than 900,000 horses. Utilizing all the cow and horse manure in the region has great economic value for the development of animal husbandry.

In the past month, the experience of Heshan County in creating cow manure to feed pigs has blossomed and borne fruit in many places in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. From the Horqin grassland on the banks of the West Liao River in the east to the Ulanqab League farm on the southern foot of the Yin Mountains in the west, successful experiments have been carried out everywhere with great results.

### 猪羊有了新饲料  内蒙古用牛马粪喂猪羊成功

　　猪羊有了新饲料
    内蒙古用牛马粪喂猪羊成功
    据新华社呼和浩特11日电　内蒙古日报今天以显著地位刊载了土默特旗桃花农业社试用牛马粪作猪羊饲料成功的喜讯，并以“一把金钥匙”为题发表社论，要求全自治区推广这一先进经验。
    桃花农业社是由蒙古、汉、满等族农民联合组成的千户大社，靠近呼和浩特市。4月初，社员们看到报纸上介绍广东省鹤山县用牛粪喂猪的经验，非常兴奋，便开始试用牛粪和马粪制作饲料喂猪羊，其间得到内蒙古畜牧兽医科学研究所的帮助，经过二十来天试验，终于成功。他们用牛马粪制成的饲料试喂五口猪，十一天内平均每口长了二十一斤肉。用牛马粪饲料喂的一只母山羊，四天内也长了五斤膘。
    桃花社用牛马粪制作猪羊饲料的方法简单易行：先把牛粪或马粪泡在清水里洗净，然后捞出放在锅里煮沸，蒸发掉腥臭气味，掺入一些青贮的甜菜叶、马铃薯粉渣、谷糠和少许食盐一起煮，取出冷却后就可以喂猪羊了。各种饲料配合比例（以一口体重六七十斤的猪两天的食量为标准）大致是：牛粪或马粪八斤半，青贮甜菜叶四斤，马铃薯粉渣二斤，糠一斤半，盐一两，水十多斤（开始时牛马粪可以少些，以后逐渐增加）。喂羊用的饲料配合量和调制方法与前相同，只是煮的时间可以短些。据化验，牛马粪含有猪羊需要的各种蛋白质、脂肪和炭水化合物。
    内蒙古日报社论指出：内蒙古自治区约有三百八十多万头牛、九十多万匹马。要把全区的牛马粪都利用起来，对发展畜牧业具有重大的经济价值。
    最近一个月来，鹤山县创造牛粪喂猪的经验，已在内蒙古自治区许多地方开花结果。东自西辽河畔的科尔沁原野，西至阴山南麓的乌兰察布盟农场，纷纷试验成功，收效很大。
