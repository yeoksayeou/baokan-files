Shanghai Launches a Surge in Studying the General Line
Municipal Party Committee Demands Further Enhancement of Socialist Consciousness Through Study

(Our Shanghai dispatch, May 28) A vigorous upsurge in studying the general line of socialist construction has begun in Shanghai. In the past two days, the broad masses of cadres, workers, peasants, and intellectuals throughout the city have been conscientiously reading the reports and documents of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress. Many workers pick up newspapers to read as soon as they get off work. Many units have organized informal talks and discussions. Shanghai newspapers carrying Comrade Shaoqi’s report sold an extra 200,000 copies yesterday, and the separate edition of the report has also been published today.

This morning, the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee held a meeting to discuss the issue of cadres throughout the city conscientiously studying and thoroughly publicizing the general line. The Municipal Party Committee demanded that this study and publicity should be more extensive and in-depth than the 1953 study and publicity of the general line for the transition period. Through this study and publicity, cadres and the masses throughout the city should further enhance their socialist consciousness and strive to implement the general line of socialist construction. The Municipal Party Committee demanded that all units closely integrate this study with the current rectification campaign, use the general line as guiding ideology, and achieve greater results in the rectification campaign.

    上海掀起学习总路线的热潮
    市委要求通过学习进一步提高社会主义觉悟
    本报上海28日电　一个大张旗鼓的学习社会主义建设总路线的热潮已在上海市开始。这两天，全市广大干部、工人、农民和知识分子，正在认真地阅读“八大”二次会议的报告和文件。许多工人一下班就拿起报纸阅读。很多单位组织了漫谈和讨论。登载少奇同志报告的上海各报，昨天额外增销了二十万份，报告的单行本也已在今日出版。
    今天上午，中共上海市委举行常委会议，对全市干部认真学习和深入宣传总路线的问题作了讨论。市委要求这次学习和宣传，应比1953年学习和宣传过渡时期总路线的规模更加广泛、深入。通过这次学习和宣传，使全市干部和群众，进一步提高社会主义觉悟，为贯彻执行社会主义建设总路线而斗争。市委要求各单位应把这次学习与当前的整风密切结合起来，以总路线为指导思想，使整风得到更大的收获。
