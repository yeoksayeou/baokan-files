    The Situation in East Indonesia
    Xinhua News Agency Compilation
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 27th (by reporter Shen Dingyi) – Indonesian government forces have recently achieved continuous victories in suppressing the East Indonesian rebels. The rebels, based in Manado and directly aided by the United States, are becoming increasingly isolated. The recent victories of the government forces are reflected in the following aspects:

    Manado Rebels Increasingly Isolated
    First, the government forces have recovered Gorontalo in North Sulawesi, most of Morotai Island in the northern Maluku Islands, and the Sangihe-Talaud Islands between the Philippines and North Sulawesi. From these three locations, the government forces have surrounded the rebel stronghold of Manado from the west, east, and north. At the same time, the Indonesian Navy has strengthened its blockade of the waters near Manado.

    The Sangihe-Talaud Islands served as a springboard for American aid to the rebels via the Philippines, an important coconut producing area, and a base for smuggling by the rebel group with foreign countries. The airbase on Morotai Island has significant strategic value, and American bombers based there threaten various parts of Indonesia. The Indonesian government forces' recovery of Gorontalo, the Sangihe-Talaud Islands, and most of Morotai Island has dealt a heavy blow to the American plot to use Indonesian rebels to invade all of East Indonesia via North Sulawesi.

    Currently, government forces are continuing to attack the rebels who have occupied the North Maluku region. Government forces have surrounded the rebels in the city of Jailolo on Halmahera Island. On Morotai Island, two companies of rebels have surrendered to the government forces. Only a few rebels remain on the island, and the government forces have essentially controlled it.

  Living Proof of US-Chiang Kai-shek Interference Captured
    The second victory of the government forces is the destruction and forced landing of more than ten aircraft supplied by the United States and the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to the rebels. Most of the rebels' "air force" has been destroyed. Among the personnel captured by the government forces from the rebel aircraft forced to land were non-Indonesians, providing living proof of armed interference in Indonesia by the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

    The above situation shows that the government air force has gained an advantage and has temporarily stopped the rebels from using American aircraft to indiscriminately bomb the East Indonesian region.

    However, it is believed here that the possibility of the United States continuing to send aircraft and personnel to harass various parts of Indonesia still exists. According to a report in today's "Indonesia Torch," the "foreign side" has again supplied two "B-29" bombers to the North Sulawesi rebels through the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

  Highly Vigilant Against American Conspiracies
    Currently, Indonesians in Jakarta are full of confidence in the victories of the government forces in the East Indonesian region, believing that they will soon be able to attack the rebel stronghold of Manado directly. However, people here are still highly vigilant against American conspiracies. They believe that the American conspiracies are nothing more than two types: one is to continue sending aircraft to transport weapons to East Indonesia in an attempt to save the rebels from destruction; the other is to put on a "benevolent" appearance and secretly engage in political interference activities, splitting Indonesia's internal unity, transforming Indonesia's struggle against foreign interference and the elimination of rebel groups into internal conflicts, and preserving the strength of Indonesian reactionaries to stage a comeback. People believe that the United States is now trying its best to adopt the second method to carry out conspiracies, but it has not yet abandoned the first method.

    东印度尼西亚战局
    新华社记者综述
    新华社雅加达27日电　本社记者沈定一报道：印度尼西亚政府军最近在进剿东印度尼西亚叛军过程中不断获得胜利。在美国直接援助下以万鸦老为基地的叛军已经越来越孤立了。政府军最近取得的胜利表现在以下几个方面：
    万鸦老叛军日益孤立
    第一，收复了北苏拉威西的哥伦打洛、马鲁古群岛北部摩罗泰岛的大部分地区以及在菲律宾和北苏拉威西之间的珊枝—塔劳群岛。政府军又从这三个地方从西、东、北三面包围了叛军老巢万鸦老地区。与此同时，印度尼西亚海军已经加强了对万鸦老附近海面的封锁。
    珊枝—塔劳群岛是美国通过菲律宾援助叛军的跳板，又是椰干的重要产地和叛乱集团同外国进行走私买卖的基地。摩罗泰岛上的空军基地有着重要的战略价值，在这个基地上的美国轰炸机威胁着印度尼西亚各地。印度尼西亚政府军收复了哥伦打洛、珊枝—塔劳群岛和摩罗泰岛的大部分地区，使美国企图通过印度尼西亚叛乱分子从北苏拉威西进而侵扰全部东印度尼西亚地区的阴谋遭到了沉重的打击。
    现在，政府军正在继续进攻侵占北马鲁古地区的叛军。政府军已经包围了哈马黑拉岛上的济罗罗市区的叛军。在摩罗泰岛上有两连叛军已经向政府军投降，岛上叛军已经所余无几，政府军已经基本上控制了这个岛屿。
  抓到美蒋干涉的活见证
    政府军获得的第二个胜利是炸毁和迫降了美国和台湾蒋介石集团供给叛军的十架以上的飞机。叛军的“空军”大部分已经被摧毁。政府军在被迫着陆的叛军飞机上俘虏的人员中有非印度尼西亚人，从而掌握了美国和蒋介石集团武装干涉印度尼西亚的活见证。
    上述情况表明，政府军空军已经取得了优势，并且已经暂时制止了叛军使用美国飞机来滥炸东印度尼西亚地区的活动。
    但是，此间认为，美国继续出机出人骚扰印度尼西亚各地的可能性仍然存在。据“印度尼西亚火炬报”今天报道，“外国方面”又通过蒋介石集团把两架“B—29”型轰炸机供给北苏拉威西叛军。
  十分警惕美国的阴谋活动
    目前，雅加达的印度尼西亚人士对政府军在东印度尼西亚地区的胜利充满信心，他们认为不久可以直捣叛军老巢万鸦老。但是，这里的人士仍旧十分警惕美国的阴谋。他们认为，美国的阴谋不外两种：一种是继续派飞机运武器到东印度尼西亚去，把叛军从灭亡的境地中挽救出来；二是装出“和善”的姿态，暗中进行政治干涉活动，分裂印度尼西亚的内部团结，把印度尼西亚反对外国干涉和消灭叛乱集团的斗争转变为内部矛盾，并且保存印度尼西亚反动分子东山再起的实力。人们认为，美国现在正在竭力采取第二种方式进行阴谋活动，但是第一种方式也还没有放弃。
