    Intellectuals in the Great Leap Forward
    Feng Ding
    Now, hundreds of millions of people are surging forward in the Great Leap Forward; intellectuals, including senior intellectuals deeply influenced by bourgeois education, are naturally no exception.
    For bourgeois intellectuals, especially senior intellectuals, ideological remolding sometimes seems more tortuous and arduous than for ordinary capitalists. This is because bourgeois senior intellectuals are the ideological representatives of the bourgeoisie. Bourgeois senior intellectuals are not only accustomed to and yearn for the bourgeois way of life, but also possess a complete system from worldview, academic thought, lifestyle, to political views; therefore, their bourgeois class consciousness is supported by a comprehensive and tenacious theory and life. "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" For senior intellectuals who represent bourgeois thought, this means not only losing the bourgeoisie to which they are attached but also losing the bourgeois thought to which they are attached. Therefore, the "means of production" on which senior intellectuals depend for their livelihood, although indirect and difficult to grasp, are twofold, and their transformation from private to public ownership requires experiencing two major shocks, both externally and internally. If bourgeois senior intellectuals stubbornly cling to bourgeois political views, then even after the economic foundation of capitalism has been basically eliminated, they will still fantasize about the restoration of capitalism and express it in words and deeds; these people have already become rightists. But even if we don't talk about political views, but insist on bourgeois lifestyles, academic thoughts, and worldviews, then their purpose of studying, their methods of studying, and their attitude towards teaching will always be individualistic, never collectivist, and therefore they will inevitably maintain more or less resistance to socialist society. This hinders ideological remolding; as for going further, doubting the superiority of the socialist system, then there is a risk of joining the rightists or being used by the rightists.
    In short, no matter how diverse the ideas of bourgeois senior intellectuals may be, they ultimately revolve around the axis of individualism. The most common manifestation of individualism is the pursuit of fame and profit. The idea of fame and profit is deeply ingrained in bourgeois senior intellectuals, truly to the bone. For example, some are engaged in science and education, and their treatment in their main profession is already quite generous, but they are indifferent to their main profession, perfunctory, and concentrate on their sideline business, cultivating "private plots." Speaking of sideline businesses, as long as they do not harm the main profession, writing articles, books, or translations that help popularize or improve socialist culture are not bad things; but precisely because they revolve around individualism, not collectivism, they are shoddy, pieced together, emphasizing quantity over quality, and some even instill reactionary ideological poisons into them. This is no different from the "profit-seeking" of capitalists. Some are not so blatantly for profit, but feel that pursuing fame is "justified" and "well-founded." In fact, the pursuit of fame and the pursuit of profit are inseparable; some collect data and write articles, all done by assistants, but the person only puts their name on it, but demands as much as half of the royalties, which is proof. Of course, some pursue fame not only in close connection with profit but also in close connection with the idea of power and position. This kind of power and position thinking either wants to "dominate" the academic world, forming cliques, or wants to obtain "official positions" in the political world, in order to look down on peers. This kind of power and position thinking is not only capitalist but also feudal. Starting from individualism, academic thought is always unhealthy and abnormal. Some believe that there are two ways to study and choose topics: one is to catch up with popular topics, and the other is to take advantage of unpopular topics. The former makes it easier to get opportunities for publication, and the latter can avoid or at least reduce the pickiness and competition of "peers." In a nutshell, it is to achieve the purpose of gaining both fame and profit through quick and cheap means. The better situation is nothing more than: having some knowledge in natural sciences and some data in social sciences, they think they are "leading figures," have made infinite contributions to society, so they work alone, demanding to build an "ivory tower," refusing to participate in any political movements and mass movements, and the result is complete detachment from reality, taking backwardness as advanced, decay as magical, and still being arrogant, complacent, and self-sufficient. Some, although diligent in their work, frequently contact students and researchers, but in order to spread their academic thoughts and academic attitudes that do not conform to the truth, to show that "their way is not isolated" and to make "successors." In fact, catching up with popular topics is not a bad thing; taking advantage of unpopular topics, as long as it does not degenerate into vulgarity, is not a bad thing either; as for being diligent in business and contacting students and researchers more, it is even less of a bad thing; however, all of these, only starting from the individual, without considering the interests of socialist society, will inevitably lead to the negative role exceeding the positive role. Individualistic academic thought and academic attitude are incompatible with the correct worldview, so they cannot but rely on the idealist worldview to make a living. To be honest, Chinese bourgeois senior intellectuals were originally more or less cultivated and supported by imperialism. As for the bourgeois worldview, it is by no means the worldview of the bourgeois flourishing period, but the worldview of the decadent and declining period. They naturally hate materialism and believe in idealism. Even if they believe in the idealism of Kant and Hegel, it is nothing more than neo-Kantianism and neo-Hegelianism; they have removed the most active factors from Kant and Hegel's doctrines and inherited the most negative factors, completely denying objective truth, detaching themselves from reality, indulging in theocracy and fideism, willing to be "martyred" for capitalism, and are not interested in the new things of the rising socialist society. In this way, from worldview, academic thought, lifestyle to political views, a reactionary thread is formed that is both different and the same. From political transformation to worldview transformation, the checkpoints to be crossed are overlapping. However, bourgeois senior intellectuals, although not accustomed to self-criticism, are very good at self-exoneration: they clearly still have conflicts with socialism in politics, but say they are already seamlessly integrated, or say that their position has long been transformed, but is simply not enough; they clearly pursue fame and profit in life, but say they have no intention of doing so, and fame and profit often "come to their door"; they are clearly maintaining old content and old forms in academia, or covering up old content with new forms, not seeking close cooperation with socialism, at least their knowledge is becoming more and more isolated and alienated from socialism due to the continuous leap forward of socialism, but they say they are serving socialism; they are clearly reactionary in their worldview, but say they are not "running counter" to socialism, or even put on the cloak of Marxism and "parade through the streets." These self-deceiving methods and self-intoxicating attitudes are not limited to a small circle of people, but are intentionally or unintentionally spreading and influencing the vast number of young intellectuals. The necessity of ideological remolding of bourgeois senior intellectuals lies here, and the harm of not remolding also lies here.
    However, after all, China's bourgeois intellectuals have come through the national democratic revolution under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party; and the current international and domestic situation is ultimately conducive to the thorough transformation of their thinking. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the national large-scale movements, including the adjustment of departments and faculties and the ideological remolding movement of intellectuals, have been shocking the minds of bourgeois senior intellectuals time and time again. Some intellectuals have long been close to the Party politically and are not so wavering. Last year, the victory of the Party and the people in repelling the bourgeois rightists' attack on the Party and socialism was even more shocking. Recently, hundreds of millions of people, following the great victory of repelling the bourgeois rightists, are making a great leap forward, especially the working people's unprecedented enthusiasm for production, and the wave of technological reforms is higher than the wave. Young people, including young students, are full of confidence in the construction of socialist society, wanting to temper themselves in the masses and in labor, and contribute their knowledge and abilities to socialist society, with an enthusiasm that is indescribable. All of these cannot but shake the bourgeois senior intellectuals, even reaching the depths of their thoughts, making the excited even more excited, and the unexcited have to be excited. Of course, the process of ideological remolding is tortuous and arduous, and the situation of excitement is also different, and will continue in the future; however, after this transformation, the vast majority of people will undoubtedly become more and more relaxed.
    The tortuous hardships of bourgeois senior intellectuals in ideological remolding can be understood by taking several professors at Peking University as examples. In this movement, the transformation of some touched their political views, and the transformation of some also began to touch their lifestyle, academic thoughts, and worldview; however, they all gradually stimulated their inner changes after constantly feeling external shocks. This is a process in which external force caused internal force and transformed from passive to active. At the beginning of the movement, some people felt that they had mastered knowledge, and it seemed that as long as they were not rightists politically, they could still rely on knowledge to eat in the future, and they did not appreciate that their political stance still needed to be completely changed, and that their knowledge must be affirmed and negated, and must undergo a qualitative change from capitalism to socialism. Therefore, they "have nothing to fear," as if they can stay out of the "gust of wind" movement, and even think that the movement is finding trouble for them and is superfluous. However, the movement ultimately does not shift with their will, and ultimately boils like stormy waves. Young students, starting from caring for their teachers, and even more from doing a good job in socialist science and teaching, posted big-character posters one after another. They "burned" themselves and each other, and regarded the opinions of teachers as the most precious "gifts," and sent them into their rooms and into their hands like holding "watermelons," so no one could not move. Some went from never reading big-character posters to secretly reading and even openly reading; some went from never attending meetings to being invited to participate and even participating on their own; some went from not wanting to talk to Communist Party members to reluctantly and even sincerely talking; some went from not daring to conduct self-criticism to conducting self-criticism on ordinary issues such as style and even on key issues such as viewpoints and positions. The development of the movement first relied on the national momentum and the active actions of young students; however, at the same time, the unfolding of criticism and self-criticism by Party organizations and Party members also played a great role in touching the hearts of bourgeois senior intellectuals. Party members were able to conduct profound criticism of Party organizations and other Party members. Some Party members conducted profound self-examination, including rightist-like thoughts, without any taboo; this made them understand that in ideological remolding, the Party's requirements for Party members are higher than those for non-Party members, and its implementation of the spirit of "curing diseases and saving people" is exactly the same. However, more importantly: in this way, a completely new atmosphere has been truly created within the people, that is, an atmosphere of mutual criticism and mutual help without any worries. This atmosphere makes it easy for people to understand that the more "burning oneself," the deeper and more thoroughly it burns, the more painful and happy it is. This is getting rid of the old and welcoming the new, a wonderful prelude to the emergence of collectivist relationships between people. After this, there is nothing to talk about between each other, and communication will become a habit, with no estrangement, no suspicion, and even less intrigue. The comfort and happiness of people's mood is conceivable. In addition, the rectification of democratic parties, straightening out their positions, also played an effective coordinating role. Of course, some issues related to the two roads and two methods in science and teaching still need to be debated after clarifying the position; but as far as the debate that has already begun, the debate is unrestrained; the debate does not circle in abstract concepts, but combines specific people, specific classes, specific teaching content and teaching methods; this makes an example for science and teaching must be linked to practice, so that everyone understands how to "speak freely and fully," and also strengthens the above-mentioned atmosphere of mutual criticism and mutual help. In short, in order to promote everyone's ideological remolding, writing big-character posters, individual communication, seminars, meetings and debates, "several keys open one lock." Therefore, some people "cried bitterly and sighed for a long time" because they had stood on the position of sectarian cliques and even imperialism in the past, and suddenly realized that "today is right and yesterday was wrong"; some people felt that it was shameful to "hold on to the old and incomplete" of some of their knowledge in the past and not to be responsible for the teaching of students, and "inferior products filled the market"; everyone felt that the bourgeois individualistic thought, for fame and profit, harms oneself and others, and is truly shocking. This is truly an earth-shattering socialist revolution for every bourgeois senior intellectual.
    This great revolution of ideological remolding of intellectuals is still advancing victoriously. Now we must "go further on the road." Not only must we continue to deepen the thoughts that have not yet touched the depths, but also enable those who have already touched the depths to blossom and bear fruit. That is to say, the significance of ideological remolding is completely positive, not negative. We must enable the ideological remolding of teachers to advance towards the goal of being both red and expert, able to be reflected in scientific reform and reflected in teaching reform, and receive the practical effects of scientific reform and teaching reform. In this way, the great leap forward of ideological remolding and the great leap forward of scientific reform and teaching reform will complement each other. The universal ideological remolding of intellectuals, and everyone becoming socialist intellectuals in name and in fact, will undoubtedly play a huge role in promoting the development of productive forces and socialist construction in all aspects.

    知识分子在大跃进
    冯定
    现在，亿兆人民万马奔腾地在大跃进中；知识分子，包括深受资产阶级教育及其影响的高级知识分子，自然也不例外。
    资产阶级的知识分子，特别是高级知识分子，进行思想改造有时比普通的资本家似乎还要曲折和艰苦。这是因为，资产阶级高级知识分子，是资产阶级的思想代表。资产阶级高级知识分子，不但习惯于和向往于资产阶级的生活方式，而且从世界观、学术思想、生活风格以至在政治见解上，都有完整的一套体系；因此他们所具有的资产阶级的阶级意识，是有理论和生活全面顽强地支持着的。“皮之不存，毛将焉附”。这对代表资产阶级思想的高级知识分子来说，既是失去所依附的资产阶级，又要失去所依附的资产阶级思想，所以高级知识分子所赖以为生的“生产资料”，虽是间接而不好捉摸的，但却是双重的，其转私有为公有是需要在身外和在身内经历两次极大的震动。资产阶级高级知识分子，如果对资产阶级的政治见解坚持不放，那么就是在资本主义的经济基础基本上已被消灭以后，还是会幻想资本主义的复辟而在言行上有所表现的，这些人已经成了右派了；但是就是不谈政治见解，而是坚持资产阶级的生活风格、学术思想和世界观，那么其治学目的、治学方法和教书态度等等，也总是个人主义的，决不会是集体主义的，因而也就不免对社会主义社会始终保持着或多或少的抵触情绪。这对思想改造起着阻滞作用；至于更进一步，就此怀疑社会主义制度的优越性，那就有投入右派或被右派利用的危险了。
    总之，资产阶级高级知识分子，不管其思想多么五花八门，归根到底是围绕着个人主义这个轴心在活动的。个人主义的最普遍表现，就是名利思想。名利思想在资产阶级的高级知识分子中，既深且透，真是到了刻骨的程度。比如有的从事科学，从事教育，在正业方面的待遇本已颇为优渥，然而偏对正业不关心，因循敷衍，而专心致志于副业，搞“自留地”。拿副业来说，只要不妨害正业，撰文著书，或者翻译，有助于社会主义文化的普及或提高，原非坏事；可是正因他们围绕的是个人主义，不是集体主义，所以粗制滥造，东凑西搭，重量不重质，有的甚至还在其中灌输反动思想的毒素。这和资本家的“唯利是图”，并无二致。有的为利并非那么赤裸裸的，而为名则就觉得“名正言顺”和“理直气壮”了。其实，为名和为利是分不开的；有的搜集资料和写成文章，都是助手做的，本人只署了名，可是索取稿费竟多至二分之一，就是证明。当然，有的为名，不但和为利有密切联系，而且还和权位思想有密切联系。这种权位思想，或者是想在学术界“称霸道王”，形成宗派，或者是想在政治界求得“一官半职”，以便睥睨侪辈。这种权位思想，不仅是资本主义的，而且是封建主义的。从个人主义出发，学术思想总是不健康的，不正常的。有的认为研究学问，选择题目，可有两种途径：一是赶热门，一是趁冷门。前者容易获得发表的机会，后者可以避免至少是可以减少“同行”的挑剔和竞争。一言以蔽之，是想通过快捷和便宜的道路，而达名利双收的目的。较好的情况也不过是：在自然科学方面多少有些知识，在社会科学方面多少有些资料，便自以为是“泰山北斗”，对社会已有无穷的贡献，于是单干独营，要求筑起“象牙之宫”，拒绝参加任何政治运动和群众运动，结果是完全脱离现实，以落后为先进，以腐朽为神奇，而还自高自大，自满自足。有的虽也勤于业务，频频接触学生和研究人员，但为的是传播其不合真理的学术思想和从事学术的态度，表明其“吾道不孤”而使“后继有人”。其实，赶热门并非坏事；趁冷门只要不流于庸俗，也并非坏事；至于勤业务，多接触学生和研究人员，更非坏事；然而一切这些，只从个人出发，不考虑对社会主义社会的利害，结果必致消极作用超过积极作用。个人主义的治学思想和治学态度，和正确的世界观格格而不相入，于是不能不依靠唯心主义的世界观在讨生活。老实说，中国资产阶级高级知识分子，本来或多或少是受帝国主义的培植和豢养的，就拿资产阶级的世界观来说，也决不是什么资产阶级奋发兴盛时期的世界观，而是腐朽没落时期的世界观。他们自然仇视唯物主义，信奉唯心主义。即使他们信奉的是康德和黑格尔等的唯心主义，也不外是新康德主义、新黑格尔主义；他们将康德和黑格尔学说中去除了最积极的因素而继承了最消极的因素，完全否认客观的真理，脱离实际，迷恋于神权主义和信仰主义，甘愿为资本主义“殉葬”，而对方兴未艾的社会主义社会的新事物不感兴趣。这样，从世界观、学术思想、生活风格到政治见解，就形成一条彼此间既有区别又是同一的反动线索。从政治上的改造至世界观上的改造，需要冲过的关口是重重叠叠的。然而资产阶级高级知识分子，虽不惯于自我批判，却很善于自我解脱：明明在政治上和社会主义尚有抵触，偏说已融洽无间，或者说立场早已转变而只是不够罢了；明明在生活上追求名利，偏说本无此意，而名利往往是“自己找上门来”的；明明在学术上是在保持旧内容和旧形式，或拿新形式掩蔽旧内容，不求和社会主义密切配合，至少其学问因社会主义的不断跃进而一天一天在和社会主义隔离开来和疏远起来，偏说是在替社会主义服务；明明在世界观上是反动的，偏说和社会主义并不“背道而驰”，或者竟披上马克思主义的外衣而“招摇过市”。这些自欺欺人的办法和自我陶醉的态度，并不只限在少数人的圈子里，而是有意无意地还在对广大的青年知识分子进行散布和发生影响。资产阶级高级知识分子改造思想的必要性在这儿，而不改造的危害性也在这儿。
    但是，我国资产阶级知识分子，终究是在中国共产党领导下经历过民族民主革命的关而来的；而当前的国际国内形势，又终究是有利于他们思想的彻底改造的。自中华人民共和国成立以后，全国性的多次大运动，其中也包括院系调整和知识分子的思想改造运动，曾一次一次地在震撼着资产阶级高级知识分子的思想。有的知识分子在政治上早就和党靠拢而不那么摇摆了。去年，党和人民反击资产阶级右派向党向社会主义进攻的胜利，震撼得更为厉害。最近，亿兆人民接着反击资产阶级右派的伟大胜利而在大跃进，特别是劳动人民对生产显出了空前未有的热情，此起彼应的技术改革一浪高过一浪。青年人，包括青年学生在内，对社会主义社会的建设，信心百倍，要想在群众中和在劳动中锻炼自己，并将自己的知识和能力贡献给社会主义社会，热情蓬勃，简直没有言语可以形容。一切这些，就更不能不撼动资产阶级高级知识分子，以至一直到达其思想深处，使振奋者格外振奋，不振奋者也不得不振奋起来。当然，思想改造过程是曲折艰苦的，振奋的情况也各不相同，而且以后还将继续；然而经过这次的改造以后，绝大多数的人，将越改造越轻松，已是无疑的了。
    资产阶级高级知识分子，在思想改造中的曲折艰苦，拿北京大学的几位教授当做例子来说，就可以了然。他们在这次运动中的改造，有的触及了他们的政治见解，有的也开始触及了他们的生活风格、学术思想和世界观；但是，他们都是经过了一次一次对外来冲击的不断感受，才逐渐激发起其内心的变化的。这是由外力引起了内力并从被动转化为主动的过程。有的人在运动之初，觉得自己是掌握知识的，好像只要政治上不是右派，那么以前曾靠知识吃饭，以后仍可以靠知识吃饭，并不体味自己的政治立场还需彻底改变，自己的知识还必须有所肯定有所否定，还必须发生从资本主义而至社会主义的质变。因此，他们“有恃无恐”，好像尽可处身于“一阵风”的运动之外，甚至认为运动是在找他们的麻烦，是多余的。然而运动终究并不以他们的意志为转移，终究像惊涛骇浪似地沸腾起来了。青年学生从爱护老师出发，更从为了搞好社会主义的科学和教学出发，大字报一张接着一张贴出来了。他们在自己和自己中间“自烧”也“互烧”，并将对老师的意见当做最宝贵的“礼物”，像捧“西瓜”似的送入其室，送上其手，于是谁也不能不动了。有的是从不看大字报，而至偷看以至明看的；有的是从不参加会议，而至被请参加以至自行参加的；有的是从不愿和共产党员谈话，而至违愿以至真心谈话的；有的是从对自我不敢进行检讨，而至对风格等普通问题以至对观点立场等要害问题也进行检讨的。运动的开展，首先是靠全国的声势和青年学生的积极行动；然而同时，党组织和党员的展开批评和自我批评，对打动资产阶级的高级知识分子的心，也起了很大的作用。党员们都能对党组织和其他党员进行深刻的批评。有的党员进行了深刻的自我检讨，包括类似右派的思想在内而无所忌讳；这就使他们明白，在思想改造上，党对党员的要求比非党员更高，而其贯彻“治病救人”的精神是完全一样的。然而更重要的是：这样就在人民内部，真正造成了一种完全新的气氛，就是毫无顾虑地相互批评和相互帮助的气氛。这种气氛容易使人理会，越是“引火烧身”，越烧得深和透，就越有既痛且快的痛快感觉。这是除旧迎新，是人和人间出现集体主义关系的精采序幕。经过这样以后，彼此间就可无话不谈，交心将成为习惯的事，没有隔阂，没有猜忌，更没有什么勾心斗角，人们心情的舒畅愉快是可想而知的。此外，民主党派的整风，端正立场，也正好起了有效的配合作用。当然，有些有关科学上、教学上的两条道路和两种方法问题，是在明辨立场之后仍需要辩论的；但是就已经开始的辩论来说，辩论是不受拘束的；辩论也并不在抽象的概念里打圈子，而是结合具体的人，具体的课，具体的教学内容和教学方法；这就替科学和教学必须联系实际做出样子，使大家懂得怎样“大鸣大放”，也加强了上述相互批评相互帮助的气氛。总之，为了促进大家的思想改造，出大字报，个别交心，座谈，开会辩论，“几把钥匙开一把锁”。于是，有的对过去曾站在宗派小圈子以至帝国主义的立场而“痛哭流涕长太息”了，恍然大悟“今是而昨非”了；有的觉得过去对自己一些知识的“抱残守缺”，而对学生的教学却不负责任，“废品充斥市场”，是可耻的了；大家都觉得资产阶级的个人主义思想，为名为利，害己害人，真是惊心动魂的了。这对每个资产阶级高级知识分子来说，真正是一次翻天覆地的社会主义大革命。
    这个知识分子思想改造的大革命，还在胜利行进的过程中。现在必须“百尺竿头，更进一步”。不但要使尚未触及思想深处的继续深入，而且要使已经触及思想深处的能够开花结实。这就是说，思想改造的意义，完全是积极的，而不是消极的。必须使老师们的思想改造，向又红又专的目标前进，能够反映在科学改革上，反映在教学改革上，而收到科学改革和教学改革的实际效果。这样，思想改造的大跃进和科学改革、教学改革的大跃进，三者就会相得益彰。知识分子的普遍进行思想改造，大家名副其实而成为社会主义的知识分子，这对生产力的发展和社会主义在各方面的建设，都将起绝大的推动作用，将是无疑的。
