Xinhua News Agency, 10th dispatch: After a double-anti movement that achieved great breakthroughs and establishments ideologically, researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geology launched a campaign in early May: "Everyone competes as Zhuge Liang, everyone offers ideas." On the "May Fourth" Youth Day alone, at the idea-offering and gift-presenting leap forward conference, the research offices presented 172 ideas and gifts.

At the "May Fourth" idea-offering and gift-presenting conference, Yu Hao, director of the Central Analysis Laboratory, installed and modified fifteen instruments with the youth and also gave a demonstration. Yu Hao suggested that by adding a spectroscopic system to the flame photometer, the determination of elements could be increased from a few to dozens. Tang Hengchu, a researcher in the Mineralogy Laboratory, offered three suggestions at the meeting, all of which were very valuable for technological reforms in mineral experiments. A field mobile analysis vehicle, designed by him and converted from a truck, will modernize field work: collected mineral specimens can be analyzed and tested on the spot. Peng Qirui, a researcher in the Mineralogy Laboratory, guided veteran worker Hu Baolin in successfully modifying the "Multi-Furnace Rapid Differential Thermal Analyzer," increasing work efficiency by more than tenfold. Personnel from the Quaternary Geology Research Office have been studying soil and water conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River since 1955. They proposed at the meeting to complete the research report on loess in the middle reaches of the Yellow River before the National Day next year, including various charts of loess. This information is of guiding significance for studying soil erosion and water conservancy development in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Hou Defeng, director of the Institute of Geology, put forward suggestions for understanding geological problems in plateau areas.

"Grasp the soul, liberate the mind, and celebrate a bumper harvest in geological science." The idea-offering and suggestion-making movement at the Institute of Geology is based on the great ideological liberation of all scientific workers and technicians in the institute. The Central Analysis Laboratory is an organization that serves the work of all research offices in the institute. In the past, researchers in the entire laboratory were buried in their own research topics, and the task of testing samples for each office was not completed year after year. After the double-anti movement, they no longer stockpiled samples from various offices. Yu Hao proposed working with half the youthful spirit, and the experimental work of the Central Analysis Laboratory under his leadership should achieve "going up the mountains, going down to the sea, and flying into the sky" within two years, which is to meet the requirements put forward by all parties in the struggle with the earth for analysis and research work. During the double-anti movement, Gu Dezhen, director of the Hydrology and Engineering Geology Research Office, had just returned from investigations and research in Sichuan and Gansu. The youth gave him more than 100 big-character posters with opinions for him. After ideological criticism, he brought his initiative into full play and formulated five-year and ten-year development plans for hydrology and engineering geology; and combined with research work, he put forward a plan for training cadres. This plan solved the problem of the direction of work that had not been resolved in this research office for a long time.

Young people have become promoters in the idea-offering and suggestion-making movement, daring to act and do things. An urgent task for the Structural Geology Laboratory is to draw a tectonic map illustrating the structural nature and activity of the Chinese crust. This map can help geological scientists infer the possible rules for the formation of ore deposits in various regions. In the past, only one or two people were assigned to make this map, and they always regarded this work as being done for the collective, a kind of sacrifice. As a result, the plan was revised many times, but it was never completed. This time, all the young people in the laboratory started together, borrowing materials, reducing maps, and supporting others after finishing their own work. After four days of intensive work, the tectonic map was completed on the eve of "May Day." The Surveying and Mapping Section had to draw twenty-one Xinjiang geological maps. According to the estimates of the veteran technicians, it would be necessary to hire seven senior technicians from other departments to draw them, and it would take three months to complete. The youth of the entire section made suggestions, requesting that the existing youth technical force be fully utilized. They used their spare time to try to draw them, and the results proved that they could complete twenty-one Xinjiang geological maps within twenty days and guarantee the quality.

The idea-offering and suggestion-making movement has formed a competition of comparing with the advanced and catching up with the advanced in the Institute of Geology. After the "May Fourth" leap forward conference, many advanced facts greatly promoted everyone. Originally, several old scientists in the Mineralogy Laboratory were working independently, but now that they have seen the benefits of collective cooperation, they are also actively holding meetings to discuss cooperation; those who only had immediate plans originally are also preparing to formulate long-term plans after seeing the long-term plans of the Hydrology and Engineering Geology Research Office. The veteran workers in the repair shop have never been willing to lag behind. They repeatedly proposed an earlier completion time for the work of assembling the field mobile analysis vehicle. They also proposed to make a semi-automatic small field thin-section grinding machine for this analysis vehicle within fifteen days. The Central Analysis Laboratory initially proposed fifteen technical reform measures, but after seeing the leap forward deeds of the entire institute, they felt inadequate. The entire laboratory continued to propose to complete the combat tasks of Red May in a fighting posture, ensuring that the workload of last year would be completed within one month. In the idea-offering and suggestion-making movement, every laboratory, group, and individual in the entire institute is looking for ways to leap forward.

Currently, other research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, such as the Institute of Botany, are also holding idea-offering and suggestion-making leap forward conferences. The scientific leap forward and technological innovation movement brought about by ideological leap forward is being carried out in research institutions in the capital.

### 人人赛诸葛　个个献计策  地质研究所研究人员思想大解放

　　人人赛诸葛　个个献计策
　　地质研究所研究人员思想大解放
    新华社10日讯　中国科学院地质研究所研究人员，经过双反运动在思想上大破大立以后，在5月上旬开展一个“人人赛诸葛，个个献计策”的运动。仅在“五四”青年节，他们举行的献计、献礼跃进大会上，各研究室提出的献计献礼就有一百七十二项。
    在“五四”献计献礼大会上，中心分析室主任余皓同青年们安装和改装了十五样仪器，还作了表演。余皓创议的把火熖比色计加上一个分光系统以后，可以由测定几个元素增加到几十个元素。矿物室研究员唐衡楚在会上献计三策，对矿物试验的技术改革方面都很有价值。他设计的一辆以卡车改装的野外流动分析车，将使野外工作现代化：采集的矿物标本可以就地分析、就地试验。矿物室研究员彭琪瑞指导老工人胡宝霖改装“多炉快速差热仪”成功，使工作效率提高十倍以上。第四纪地质研究室人员从1955年开始研究黄河中游水土保持的工作。他们在会上提出要在明年国庆节以前完成黄河中游黄土研究报告，并包括黄土的各类图表。这份资料对研究黄河中游水土流失和开发水利具有指导意义。地质研究所所长侯德封提出了解高原地区地质问题的建议。
    “抓住灵魂，解放思想，地质科学庆丰收”，地质研究所的献计献策运动就是建立在全所科学工作者和技术人员思想大解放的基础上的。中心分析室是为全所各研究室的工作服务的机构。过去，全室的研究人员都埋头于自己的研究题目，为各室化验标本的任务年年完不成。双反运动以后，他们就不再积压各室的标本了。余皓提出要以年轻一半的心情来工作，在他领导下的中心分析室的实验工作要在两年内做到“上山、下海、飞天”，就是要满足各方面在和地球作斗争中对分析研究工作提出的要求。在双反运动中，水文、工程地质研究室主任谷德振刚从四川、甘肃调查研究回来。青年们交给他一百多条向他提出意见的大字报，他经过思想批判以后，发挥了积极性，制定了五年和十年的水文、工程地质的发展规划；并且结合研究工作，提出了培养干部的规划。这个规划解决了这个研究室长期没有解决的工作方向问题。
    青年人在献计献策运动中当了促进派，敢作敢为。构造室一个迫不及待的任务是绘制一个说明中国地壳构造性质和它的活动情况的大地构造图。这个图可以帮助地质科学工作者推测各地区矿床可能形成的规律。过去制作这个图只确定一两个人干，而且他们总是把这个工作看作是为集体做的，是一种牺牲，结果计划订了多次，始终没有完成。这次，全室青年一齐动手，借资料的借资料，缩图的缩图，自己的工作做完了就去支援别人。经过四天的突击，大地构造图在“五一”前夕完成了。测绘科要绘制二十一幅新疆地质图，根据老技术员的估计，需要从别的部门去聘请七个高级技术人员来绘制，而且要三个月的时间才能完成。全科青年提出建议，要求充分使用现有青年技术人员的力量，他们利用业余时间试画，结果证明他们可以在二十天内完成二十一幅新疆地质图，并且可以保证质量。
    献计献策运动在地质研究所形成了比先进、赶先进的竞赛。“五四”跃进大会以后，很多先进事实对大家起了很大的推动作用。原来矿物室的几个老科学家都是单干的，现在看到集体合作的好处以后，也积极开会商谈合作；原来只有眼前计划的，看到水文、工程地质研究室的长远规划，也准备制定长远计划。修配间的老工人从来就不甘落后的。他们在装配野外流动分析车的工作中，一再提出提前完成的时间。他们并提出在十五天内为这辆分析车制出一台半自动化的野外小型切片磨片机。中心分析室开始提出了十五项技术改革措施，但是看到全所的跃进事迹以后，又感到不足。全室继续提出要以战斗姿态来完成红五月的战斗任务，保证在一个月内完成去年一年的工作量。在献计献策运动中，全所每个室、组、个人，都在找跃进的门路。
    目前中国科学院的其他研究机构，如植物研究所等也都在举行献计献策跃进大会。思想跃进带来的科学跃进和技术革新运动，正在首都研究机构中开展起来。
