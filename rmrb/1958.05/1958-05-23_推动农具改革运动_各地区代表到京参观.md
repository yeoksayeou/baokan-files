On the 20th, the exhibition received the first group of visitors, totaling over 2,500 people, from the five provinces of Heilongjiang, Shanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Jiangsu, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

According to the plans of various provinces and autonomous regions, from now until the beginning of October, various localities will organize cadres, technical personnel, and workers from departments of agriculture, industry, transportation, forestry, animal husbandry, land reclamation, supply and marketing cooperatives, handicrafts, and relevant schools, in batches, totaling more than 48,000 people, to visit the exhibition for study and observation. Each batch will dedicate one day to discussions of their learning experiences and exchange of ideas, in order to further promote the agricultural tool reform movement.

Since its opening on the 5th, the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition has received over 77,400 visitors, including spontaneously organized tour groups from Hebei, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Henan, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Sichuan, Jilin, Liaoning, Hubei, and other places.

In the past two weeks, many people from various provinces have spontaneously come to visit and learn. The person in charge of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition believes that this demonstrates the increasing enthusiasm of the broad masses for technological revolution. He hopes that various localities will meet the requirements of the masses for visits and learning, and do a good job in organizing visits, so as to avoid spontaneous arrivals by the masses without a plan, so as to prevent difficulties in accommodation and other issues after arriving in Beijing.
