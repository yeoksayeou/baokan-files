    Comprehensive Utilization of Hun River
    Huanren Hydropower Station Begins Construction
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th — The Huanren Hydropower Station, being built in the Hun River basin in eastern Liaoning, has recently officially commenced construction.
    The designed power generation capacity of this hydropower station is 290,000 kilowatts. Once completed, it will greatly expand the existing scale of the power grids in Shenyang, Fushun, Anshan, and other places. At the same time, after the completion of the hydropower station, an artificial lake with a capacity of more than 8.3 billion cubic meters and a surface area of more than 270 square kilometers will appear, which will not only benefit the production of 140,000 mu of farmland along the river but also allow long-term shipping on the 200-plus kilometer stretch of the Hun River's upper reaches.
    The dam site of the Huanren Hydropower Station is located at a dangerous gorge with rapid water flow. During the flood season from July to September, the maximum flow can reach 8,500 cubic meters per second. Building a hydropower station here costs more than one-fifth less than building a thermal power station of the same scale, and it can save 340,000 tons of coal each year.

    综合利用浑江
    桓仁水电站开工
    据新华社沈阳20日电  在辽东浑江流域兴建的桓仁水电站，最近正式动工。
    这个水电站的设计发电能力为二十九万瓩。它建成以后，将大大扩展沈阳、抚顺、鞍山等地电力网的现有规模。同时，水电站建成以后，还要出现一个容量达八十三亿多立方公尺、库面达二百七十多平方公里的人工湖，不仅有利于沿江十四万亩农田生产，而且可以在浑江上游二百多公里的河面上长期行船。
    桓仁水电站的坝址设在一个险要的峡口，水势湍急，每逢7月至9月洪水高涨时期，最大流量可以达到八千五百秒公方。在这里建设的水电站，比建设一座同样规模的火电站，成本低五分之一以上，而且每年能节省三十四万吨煤。
