    Hangzhou Silk Printing and Dyeing Factory Produces Silk
    The first phase of China's first modern silk printing and dyeing integrated factory—the Hangzhou Silk Printing and Dyeing Integrated Factory—was basically completed on May Day. It officially started trial production on the 2nd, reeling out the first batch of 184 *jin* of snow-white raw silk.
    The first phase of the factory's silk reeling production capacity is equivalent to half of the total output of the current fifteen silk reeling factories in Zhejiang Province, accounting for about one-seventh of the country's total raw silk output. The second phase of earthwork construction has now begun. Originally planned to be fully completed in 1960, the builders, inspired by the situation of the Great Leap Forward, have decided to advance the completion date to the fourth quarter of next year. It will then be fully put into production, producing more than 13 million meters of silk and satin annually, averaging 1,000 bolts of beautiful and colorful silk and satin that can be woven and dyed every day.

    杭州丝绸印染厂出丝
    我国第一座现代化的丝绸印染联合工厂——杭州丝绸印染联合厂第一期工程，在“五一”基本完成，2日正式试车生产，缫出了第一批一百八十四斤洁白如雪的生丝。
    这个厂第一期工程的缫丝生产能力，相当于目前浙江全省十五家缫丝厂总产量的一半，约占全国生丝总产量七分之一。现在第二期土方工程已经开工，原计划在1960年全部建成；在大跃进的形势鼓舞下，建设者们决定提前到明年四季度就全部建成投入生产，每年可产绸缎一千三百多万公尺，平均每天就能织染出一千匹绮丽多彩的绸缎。
