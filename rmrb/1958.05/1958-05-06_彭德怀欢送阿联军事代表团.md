Xinhua News Agency, May 5th. Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, held a banquet in Beijing tonight to bid farewell to the military goodwill delegation of the United Arab Republic, led by Lieutenant General Muhammad Ibrahim.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said at the banquet that the military goodwill delegation of the United Arab Republic had paid a friendly visit to our country for more than a month, which not only strengthened the understanding between the armed forces of our two countries, enhanced the friendship between the armed forces of the two countries, but also played a positive role in developing friendly exchanges between the armed forces of our two countries.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said: "Imperialism will not be reconciled to their defeat. After the failure of armed aggression, they are racking their brains to carry out internal subversion, economic pressure, threats and inducements, etc. When these despicable means fail, they may launch another open aggression, the purpose of which is to attempt to restore their colonial rule. However, we firmly believe that as long as our people can unite as one, as long as all peace-loving countries can cooperate in a friendly manner, any conspiracy of imperialism is doomed to failure."

Marshal Peng Dehuai finally wished the people and army of the United Arab Republic new victories in the struggle to safeguard their national independence, and wished the friendship between the people and army of China and the UAR to develop even further.

Head of Delegation Ibrahim said at the banquet that we have spent more than a month among the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. You have provided us with all the conveniences and shown us everything we wanted to see. Everywhere we went, people treated us like brothers. We also feel like we are at home.

Head of Delegation Ibrahim said that I admire the contribution of the Chinese army to national construction. This proves that this army is part of the people and works for the interests of the people. He said that this visit has left us with a deep impression, and we will bring these unforgettable memories back to our motherland. I am convinced that this visit will help enhance the deep friendship that already exists between us.

Present at the dinner tonight were: Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Hanfu, General Su Yu, General Xu Guangda, General Li Da, General Zhang Zongxun, General Xiao Hua, General Guo Tianmin, General Chen Xilian, General Yang Chengwu, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Xiao Xiangrong, Lieutenant General Wang Bingzhang of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Chang Qiankun of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Luo Shun Chu of the Navy, Lieutenant General Zhou Xihan of the Navy, and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and Colonel Li Dazhong, the military attaché of our country stationed in the UAR.

Shibini, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Embassy of the United Arab Republic in China, was invited to attend the banquet.

Military attachés of various countries stationed in China were also invited to attend the banquet.

    彭德怀欢送阿联军事代表团
    新华社5日讯　国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅今晚在北京举行宴会，欢送以穆罕默德·易卜拉欣中将为首的阿拉伯联合共和国军事友好访华代表团。
    彭德怀元帅在宴会上讲话说，阿拉伯联合共和国军事友好访华代表团，在我国进行了一个多月的友好访问，不仅加强了我们两国军队之间的了解、增进了两国军队之间的友谊，并对发展我们两国军队之间的友好来往，起了积极的作用。
    彭德怀元帅说：“帝国主义是不会甘心于他们的失败的。在武装侵略失败以后，他们正在处心积虑地施行内部颠覆、经济压力、威胁利诱等手段，当他们这些卑鄙手段失败之后，也可能又来一个公开的侵略，其目的就是企图恢复他们的殖民统治。然而我们坚信，只要我们人民能够团结一致，只要所有爱好和平的国家能够友好合作，帝国主义的任何阴谋注定要失败的。”
    彭德怀元帅最后祝阿拉伯联合共和国的人民和军队，在维护自己民族独立的斗争中，获得新的胜利，祝中阿两国人民和军队之间的友谊，更加发展。
    易卜拉欣团长在宴会上讲话说，我们已经在中国人民解放军官兵们中间度过了一个多月，你们给我们一切方便，给我们看一切我们所要看的东西。我们每到一地，人们像接待兄弟一样地接待我们。我们也感到像在家里一样。
    易卜拉欣团长说，我很钦佩中国军队对国家建设的贡献。这证明了这支军队是人民的一部分，是为人民的利益而工作的。他说，这次访问给我们留下了深刻的印象，我们将把这些令人难忘的记忆带回到我们的祖国去。我深信这次访问将有助于增进我们之间已存的深厚友谊。
    出席今晚宴会的有：国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅，外交部副部长章汉夫，粟裕大将、许光达大将、李达上将、张宗逊上将、萧华上将、郭天民上将、陈锡联上将、杨成武上将、刘志坚中将、萧向荣中将、王秉璋空军中将、常乾坤空军中将、罗舜初海军中将、周希汉海军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领和我国驻阿联武官李大中上校。
