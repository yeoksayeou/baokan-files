　　Algerian Liberation Army Heavily Strikes Colonial Troops
    French Newspaper Reports 1,200 French Soldiers Surrender
    Xinhua News Agency, Algiers, 10th: A communique released by the French colonial authorities on the evening of the 8th admitted that the Algerian National Liberation Army is intensifying its attacks on French troops.
    The Algerian National Liberation Army and the French army engaged in fierce battles northeast of Téniet El Haâd. In just thirty-six hours from the 6th to the 7th, there were five engagements. Reports indicate that 30 French soldiers were killed.
    On the eastern front in Algeria, the French army deployed jet fighters for support. In battles occurring sixty miles south of Algiers, the French army also deployed helicopters to transport infantry reinforcements. The French side's losses in these intense battles have not been disclosed.
    In order to block news unfavorable to the French colonial army, the colonial authorities in Algiers confiscated six newspapers from Paris on the 6th, including "l'Humanité," "Libération," "Le Monde," "Combat," "Paris-Presse," and "La Croix," because these newspapers all reported the news of 1,200 soldiers surrendering to the Algerian National Liberation Army south of Algiers.

　　阿解放军狠狠打击殖民军
    法报报道法军一千二百名投降
    据新华社10日讯　阿尔及尔消息：法国殖民军方面在8日晚上发表的公报承认，阿尔及利亚民族解放军正在加紧打击法国军队。
    阿尔及利亚民族解放军和法军在特尼耶特哈德东北发生了激烈的战斗。仅在6日至7日的三十六小时中，双方就发生了五次战斗。有消息说，法军死亡三十人。
    在阿尔及利亚东部战场，法军出动喷气战斗机助战。在阿尔及尔以南六十英里的地方发生的战斗中，法军还出动直升飞机运输步兵增援。在这些激烈的战斗中法军方面的损失没有公布。
    为了封锁对法国殖民军不利的消息，阿尔及尔的殖民当局在6日没收了从巴黎来的“人道报”、“解放报”、“世界报”、“战斗报”、“巴黎新闻”和“十字架报”等六种报纸，因为这些报纸都报道了在阿尔及尔南部的一千二百名士兵向阿尔及利亚民族解放军投降的消息。
