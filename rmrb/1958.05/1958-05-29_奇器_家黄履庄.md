    Huang Luzhuang was a young mechanical inventor in China in the 17th century. By the age of seven or eight, he was already able to carve wooden figures that could walk and place them on the table to play with. Later, he understood the principles of proportion in geometry and created many things that people at the time called "odd devices." He had no teacher, and no one to guide him; everything was the result of his own thinking. By the age of twenty-eight, he had already created the "Cold and Heat Tester," the "Dryness and Humidity Tester," the "Dragon Tail Cart," and the "Auspicious Light Mirror," among other things.

    Huang Luzhuang's "Dryness and Humidity Tester" could predict the weather. This instrument: "has a needle inside that can rotate left and right. It rotates left when dry and right when wet, with perfect accuracy. It can also predict cloudy or sunny weather." This is exactly the same in principle as the wheel barometer invented by Hooke in Europe in 1665.

    “奇器”家黄履庄
    黄履庄是十七世纪我国的一个青年机械发明家。他七、八岁时，已经能用木料雕琢会走动的小人放在桌上玩。后来他懂得了几何学上比例的道理，更制造了许多当时人们称为“奇器”的东西。他没有老师，也没有人指点他，一切都是自己思索得到的。到二十八岁时，他已经制造了“验冷热器”、“验燥湿器”、“龙尾车”、“瑞光镜”等。
    黄履庄的“验燥湿器”能预测阴晴。这个仪器是：“内有一针，能左右旋。燥则左旋，湿则右旋，毫发不爽。并可预证阴晴。”这和欧洲的虎克在1665年发明的轮状气压表的原理完全相同。
