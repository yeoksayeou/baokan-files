Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd. The Capital's "May Day" International Labor Day Celebration Preparatory Committee held a grand fireworks gala in Beihai Park tonight.

As night fell, the bright moon hung in the sky. The Beihai Lake shimmered with golden light, reflecting thousands of lights. Festive music was broadcast from Qionghua Island. Over 30,000 people spent a pleasant evening here.

At 8:10 PM, ceremonial fireworks were launched from the White Pagoda, followed by various fireworks bursting into the sky from dozens of fireworks platforms on the water, like a riot of blooming flowers. A burst of firecrackers sounded, and the colorful "Yangtze River Bridge" appeared. Colored sparks dotted the bridge's body, like trains and cars speeding back and forth. At the bridgeheads, patterns of peace doves and the slogan "Long Live World Peace" were formed with colored flowers. On the "Flower Rack" towering over the lake, hundreds of flowers bloomed, with two red "Happiness" characters appearing in the flower clusters. At the southern end of Beihai, suddenly countless "fire dragons" shot up into the sky, with thousands of fireballs tumbling up and down in the night sky. There were also "Starry Sky," "Hundred Flowers Bloom," "Straw Boats Borrowing Arrows," "Eighteen Scholars," "Grand Hundred Flowers Garden," "Imperial Orchard," "Grape Arbor," "Lotus Pot," "Peace Arch," "Exquisite Pagoda," as well as various "boxes," "Seven-Star Tubes," "Nine-Linked Rings," and "Ten Thousand Lamps," and other fireworks with national characteristics.

Today's fireworks came from fourteen provinces and cities, including Hubei, Guangdong, Sichuan, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, Shaanxi, and Lüda. These are their gifts to the people of the capital to celebrate the festival, and also a grand review of fireworks from all over China.

Premier Zhou Enlai and other state leaders, responsible persons from central and Beijing municipal departments, as well as diplomatic envoys from various countries to China and many international friends in Beijing, watched tonight's fireworks. (Photo attached)

    夜幕降临，皓月当空。北海湖上金光鳞鳞，映照出万盏灯火。琼岛上播送着节日的音乐。三万多人在这里度过了一个愉快的夜晚。
    八点十分，白塔上放出礼花，接着水面上几十个焰火台上各种火花腾向天空，犹如群花争艳，一阵花炮响起，彩色缤纷的“长江大桥”出现了，在桥身中间彩花点点，好像火车和汽车往返奔驰，在桥头上出现了用彩花组成的和平鸽的图案和“世界和平万岁”的标语。高耸在湖面的“群花架”上，百花盛开，花丛中显出了两个红色的“喜”字。在北海南端，突然无数条“火龙”钻天而上，千百个火球在夜空中上下翻腾。这里还有“满天星”、“百花齐放”、“草船借箭”、“十八学士”，有“大百花园”、“御果园”、“葡萄架”、“莲花缸”、“和平坊”、“玲珑宝塔”，以及各种“盒子”、“七星筒”、“九连环”、“万盏灯”，等具有民族特点的焰火。
    今天的焰火，来自湖北、广东、四川、山东、河北、辽宁、陕西、旅大等十四个省市，这是他们给首都人民祝贺节日的礼物，也是我国各地焰火的一次大检阅。
    周恩来总理和国家的其他领导人、中央和北京市各部门的负责人，以及各国驻华使节和在京的很多国际友人，观看了今晚的焰火。（附图片）
