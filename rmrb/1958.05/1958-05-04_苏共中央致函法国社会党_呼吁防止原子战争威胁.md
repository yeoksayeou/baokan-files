Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 3rd: "The Truth" published on the 2nd the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to the Steering Committee of the French Socialist Party. This letter calls on the French Socialist Party to do everything possible to prevent the intensifying threat of atomic war, and calls on the leadership of the party to exchange views with the CPSU Central Committee on issues related to defending peace and ensuring the security of the people.

The letter from the CPSU Central Committee said that the resolution passed by the West German Federal Parliament on arming the West German army with atomic weapons and rockets greatly aggravated the international situation and posed a practical danger to the cause of peace, first and foremost endangering European countries, especially those bordering the Federal Republic of Germany.

The letter stated that the French people and the people of all countries understand that there is only one way to avoid atomic war, and that is peaceful cooperation between countries, ending the Cold War, and stopping the arms race. Now more than ever, it is necessary to unite all forces to fight for the noble cause of peace, so that the heinous plans of the West German military leaders will not become a terrible reality threatening the people of all countries.

In this letter, the CPSU Central Committee called on the Steering Committee of the French Socialist Party and the Socialist Party members to unite the French working class and all peace-loving forces in France, to strive to eliminate the "Cold War," stop the arms race, stop nuclear weapons testing, and strive to safeguard and consolidate peace. The letter said, "We are deeply convinced that only by actively fighting against the threat of a devastating atomic war can the French people guarantee their economic prosperity and peaceful life, and can France guarantee its future as a great power."

The letter also stated that, in view of the urgent need to unite all working-class ranks and all peace-loving forces to prevent a devastating atomic war, the CPSU Central Committee believes that it is desirable and beneficial for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the French Socialist Party to exchange views, in any form, on what effective practical measures could be taken to defend peace and ensure the security of all peoples. The CPSU Central Committee is also willing to study any constructive proposals put forward by the French Socialist Party for maintaining and consolidating peace.

    苏共中央致函法国社会党
    呼吁防止原子战争威胁
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”2日发表了苏联共产党中央委员会给法国社会党指导委员会的一封信，这封信呼吁法国社会党尽一切可能来防止日益加剧的原子战争威胁，并且呼吁这个党的领导机构同苏共中央就有关保卫和平和保证人民安全的问题交换意见。
    苏共中央的信说，西德联邦议院通过的关于以原子武器和火箭武器武装西德军队的决议大大地加剧了国际局势，它给和平事业造成了实际的危险，首先是危及欧洲各国，特别是同德意志联邦共和国毗邻的国家。
    信中说，法国人民和世界各国人民都明白，只有一条避免原子战争的道路，这条道路就是各国之间和平合作、停止冷战和停止军备竞赛。现在比任何时候都更加必须团结一切力量来为崇高的和平事业而斗争，使西德国防军将领们的罪恶计划不至于成为威胁各国人民的可怕现实。
    苏共中央在这封信里呼吁法国社会党指导委员会和社会党党员把法国工人阶级和法国一切爱好和平的力量团结起来，争取消除“冷战”、停止军备竞赛、停止核武器试验，争取维护和巩固和平。信中说，我们深信，只有积极进行反对毁灭性的原子战争威胁的斗争，法国人民才能保证自己的经济繁荣与和平生活，法国才能保证自己的大国前途。
    这封信还说，鉴于有迫切的必要把所有工人阶级队伍和所有爱好和平的力量团结起来以防止毁灭性的原子战争；苏共中央认为，由苏联共产党和法国社会党通过任何形式就可能采取什么有效的实际措施来保卫和平和保证各国人民安全这个问题交换意见，是我们所希望的而且是很有好处的。苏共中央还愿意研究法国社会党为了维护和巩固和平而提出的任何建设性的建议。
