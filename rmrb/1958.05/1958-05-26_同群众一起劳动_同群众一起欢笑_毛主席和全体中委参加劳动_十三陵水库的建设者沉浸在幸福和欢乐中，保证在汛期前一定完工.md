Xinhua News Agency, May 25th: This reporter reports: Today, as people happily spent their holiday, our beloved Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrades Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping, members and alternate members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, secretaries and alternate secretaries of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and all members and alternate members of the Central Committee, participated in voluntary labor at the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir construction site.

Today was a rare hot day in Beijing, with a blazing sun and not a trace of breeze. At 1:00 PM, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party began to gather at Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai. Almost everyone was dressed in ordinary laborers' clothes. They wore straw hats, coarse cloth clothes, and round-mouthed cloth shoes. At 1:40 PM, the Party leaders set off for the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir construction site in five buses.

Chairman Mao Zedong sat by the window of the bus, chatting and laughing along the way. Chairman Mao frequently gazed at the green, rolling wheat fields, and at the newly sprouted cotton, corn, and pea seedlings, a pleasant smile on his kind face.

"It seems a bit dry!" Chairman Mao asked Comrade Liu Ren, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, with concern.

"It's a little dry!" said Comrade Liu Ren.

"Is there water to irrigate the fields?" Chairman Mao asked again.

Comrade Liu Ren pointed to both sides of the road and told Chairman Mao: "There is a water source on the west side of the road, and an aqueduct has been built, so the crops are growing better. The east side of the road lacks water, so the crops are growing worse." Comrade Liu Ren also told Chairman Mao that the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir, once completed, could irrigate 300,000 mu of land.

Chairman Mao nodded frequently as he listened.

As rows of new houses and tents came into view, Chairman Mao asked Comrade Liu Ren again: "Who lives there?" Comrade Liu Ren said: "Those are the residences of the reservoir builders."

At 3:20 PM, the buses arrived at the construction site headquarters. As soon as Chairman Mao and the leaders of the Party Central Committee got out of the buses, they were discovered by the reservoir builders, who gathered around the Party Central Committee leaders, applauding and cheering "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

The news of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee leaders participating in voluntary labor immediately spread throughout the entire construction site. It is difficult to truly describe the jubilation at the construction site at this moment. Wherever the Central Committee leaders went, people followed, and everywhere there was a grand scene of tens of thousands welcoming Chairman Mao. Tens of thousands of smiling faces greeted Chairman Mao, and tens of thousands of people shouted the same cheer: "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao and others first ascended the east abutment of the reservoir to view the entire reservoir. The Party Central Committee leaders saw that a large dam had risen high. Comrade Zhao Fan, the political commissar of the reservoir construction site, introduced that the dam was 29 meters high and had now been built to 23 meters.

"Can you guarantee completion before the flood season arrives?" Chairman Mao asked with concern.

"We will definitely complete it on schedule," Comrade Zhao Fan replied with great confidence.

"How many people are working?"

"There are 100,000 people, transporting 50,000 cubic meters of earth to the dam every day."

During the break, Chairman Mao, at the invitation of the reservoir headquarters, personally wrote the five characters "Thirteen Tombs Reservoir." Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De also wrote inscriptions for the reservoir. Comrade Shaoqi's inscription was: "Long Live Labor!" Comrade Enlai's inscription was: "Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results." Comrade Zhu De's inscription was: "Moving mountains and creating seas, united as one."

After the inscriptions, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee leaders, passing through layers of welcoming crowds, began their voluntary labor.

5:35 PM was an unforgettable moment. At this very moment, Chairman Mao and Comrade Peng Zhen together held shovels and shoveled earth for the reservoir project. As Chairman Mao shoveled the earth, tens of thousands of people gathered around, carefully watching with happy eyes how Chairman Mao sent shovel after shovel of earth into the wicker baskets.

As soon as Chairman Mao put down the shovel, a PLA soldier named Yu Bingsen immediately wrapped the shovel in his clothes. He said excitedly: "Seeing this shovel, we think of Chairman Mao, and this will give us even greater drive." An agricultural cooperative member, with tears of excitement, said to the reporter: "In the past, the emperors exploited our money and forced the people to build tombs for them at the Thirteen Tombs. Today, the Communist Party leads us in building reservoirs at the Thirteen Tombs to produce more grain and improve the people's lives! Chairman Mao, he is so busy, yet he still comes to build reservoirs with us, which brings us so much encouragement and strength!"

In a place in front of the dam, other leaders of the Central Committee were working with the reservoir builders. Comrade Shaoqi first leveled the earth with the laborers, and then sang labor songs and pounded the earth with them. Comrade Enlai first stood in a long line of laborers and carried earth up the dam with them, and then carried earth on a shoulder pole. Comrade Zhu De and Comrade Xiaoping both worked with the laborers, participating in leveling the earth and carrying earth on a shoulder pole.

People saw that Dong Biwu, Peng Dehuai, He Long, Li Xiannian, Ulanhu, Zhang Wentian, Lu Dingyi, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and Bo Yibo were also sweating profusely, shoveling and carrying earth. Comrade Lin Biao had arrived at the construction site earlier in the morning to participate in voluntary labor. Wu Yuzhang, Xu Teli, and Xie Juezai, although over seventy years old, still had the same great drive as the young people.

Our Party Central Committee leaders were so approachable, they worked together with the laborers, talking and laughing, they were members of the masses.

Chairman Mao Zedong and the Party Central Committee leaders left the construction site at 6:40 PM. But the reservoir builders were still immersed in happy and joyful memories. Many people were talking with great interest about their thoughts on seeing Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee leaders building the reservoir today, and many people left the most unforgettable page in their diaries today. Wang Kewu, deputy company commander of the PLA tank soldiers, said that Chairman Mao and the Central Committee leaders' participation in labor has further encouraged our drive. We must devote all our strength to ensure that the dam is built as soon as possible. The 100,000 reservoir builders are responding to the care of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee leaders with practical actions. They expressed their determination to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results with their greatest efforts, and to create a happy life for the people with their greatest efforts.

    同群众一起劳动  同群众一起欢笑
    毛主席和全体中委参加劳动
    十三陵水库的建设者沉浸在幸福和欢乐中，保证在汛期前一定完工
    据新华社25日讯　本社记者报道：今天，当人们愉快地度着假日的时候，我们敬爱的毛泽东主席和刘少奇、周恩来、朱德、邓小平同志，中共中央政治局委员、候补委员，中央书记处书记、候补书记，以及全体中央委员和候补委员，到十三陵水库工地参加了义务劳动。
    今天是北京少有的一个大热天，烈日高照，没有一丝微风。下午一时，中国共产党的领导人就陆续来到中南海怀仁堂集合。差不多每个人都是一身普通劳动者的装束。他们头戴草帽，身着粗布衣，脚穿圆口布鞋。一点四十分，党的领导者们分乘五辆公共汽车向十三陵水库工地进发。
    毛泽东主席坐在汽车靠窗的座位上，沿路谈笑风生。毛主席不时地凝望着田野里绿油油地滚滚麦浪，凝望着刚出土不久的棉花、玉米、豌豆苗，慈祥的脸上呈现出愉快的微笑。
    “看来有点旱意了！”毛主席关心地问中共北京市委书记刘仁同志。
    “是有点微旱！”刘仁同志说。
    “有没有水浇田？”毛主席又问。
    刘仁同志指着大路两旁告诉毛主席：“路西有水源，修了引水渠，所以农作物生长得好一些，路东水源缺，农作物长得就差一些。”刘仁同志还告诉毛主席：十三陵水库修成后能灌溉三十万亩土地。
    毛主席听着频频点头。
    眼前出现了一片片新屋和帐篷，毛主席又问刘仁同志：“那是什么人住的？”刘仁同志说：“那就是水库建设者们的住处。”
    三点二十分，汽车到达了工地指挥所。毛主席和党中央的领导人一走下汽车，就被水库建设者们发现了，他们聚拢在党中央领导同志的周围，不停地鼓掌，不停地欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席和党中央领导同志参加义务劳动的消息立刻传遍了整个工地。要如实地形容出这时工地的欢腾情形是很难的。中央领导同志走到那里，人们就跟到那里，到处都出现了万人欢迎毛主席的盛况，几万张笑脸迎着毛主席，几万个人发出同样的欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    毛主席等首先登上水库东墩台观看水库的全景。党中央的领导同志们看到，一条大坝已高高地隆起。水库工地政委赵凡同志介绍说，这条大坝高二十九公尺，现在已筑到二十三公尺。
    “是不是能保证在洪水到来以前修成？”毛主席关切地问。
    “一定能够如期完工。”赵凡同志十分有把握地回答。
    “有多少人在工作？”
    “有十万人，每天运五万方土到大坝上。”
    在休息的时候，毛主席应水库指挥部的邀请亲笔写了“十三陵水库”五个字。刘少奇、周恩来、朱德同志都为水库题了词。少奇同志的题词是：“劳动万岁！”恩来同志的题词是：“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义。”朱德同志的题词是：“移山造海，众志成城。”
    题词以后，毛主席和党中央的领导同志，就穿过层层欢迎的群众开始了义务劳动。
    五点三十五分，这是一个难忘的时刻。就在这个时刻里，毛主席和彭真同志一起手执铁锨为水库工程铲土。当毛主席铲土的时候，在周围聚集上万的人以幸福的眼光仔细看着毛主席怎样把一锨一锨的土送进柳条筐里。
    毛主席刚一放下铁锨，一个叫余秉森的解放军战士，马上用自己的衣服把这张铁锨包起来。他激动地说：“看到这张锨，我们就想起了毛主席，这样，我们的干劲就会更大。”有一位农业合作社的社员流着兴奋的眼泪对记者说：“过去的皇帝剥削了我们的钱，强迫人民在十三陵给他们修陵墓，今天共产党领导我们在十三陵修水库多打粮食改善人民生活！毛主席呀，他老人家那样忙，还来和我们一起修水库，这给我们带来多么大的鼓舞和力量！”
    在大坝前的一个地方，中央的其他领导同志同水库的建设者们一起进行劳动。少奇同志起先是同民工们一起平土，后来又同民工们一起唱着劳动号子打夯。恩来同志先是站在排成长列的民工队里和他们一起往大坝上传土，后来又挑土。朱德同志和小平同志都和民工们一起，一会儿参加平土，一会儿又参加挑土。
    人们看到，董必武、彭德怀、贺龙、李先念、乌兰夫、张闻天、陆定一、陈伯达、康生、薄一波同志也在汗流浃背地挑土铲土。林彪同志早在上午就到了工地参加义务劳动。吴玉章、徐特立、谢觉哉，虽然年过古稀，但仍然和青年人一样的干劲很大。
    我们党中央的领导人是那样的平易近人，他们同民工们劳动在一起，又说又笑，他们就是群众中间的一员。
    毛泽东主席和党中央的领导同志在六时四十分离开了工地。但是水库的建设者们依然沉浸在幸福和欢乐的回忆中。许多人在饶有兴趣地谈论着今天看到毛主席和党中央领导人修水库的感想，许多人在今天的日记上留下了最难忘的一页。人民解放军坦克兵副连长王克武说，毛主席和中央领导同志来参加劳动，更加鼓舞了我们的干劲。我们一定要拿出全部力量，保证尽快地把大坝修好。十万水库建设者们正在用实际行动来回答毛主席和中央领导同志的关怀。他们表示要用最大的努力多快好省地来建设社会主义，要用最大的努力来为人民创造幸福的生活。（附图片）
