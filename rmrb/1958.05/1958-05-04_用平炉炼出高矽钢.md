Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 3rd. After creating the three-tap steelmaking method, the steelmaking workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant made new achievements in April. The workers of the plant's No. 3 open hearth furnace overcame the difficulties that multi-tap open hearth furnaces could not smelt alloy steel, and on April 27, they successfully test-smelted the first heat of low-silicon steel, with the composition fully meeting the standards. Subsequently, the workers of the Youth Furnace broke with convention and also used an open hearth furnace to test-smelt the first heat of high-silicon steel. High-silicon steel requires very low sulfur content, and the open hearth furnace itself has poor desulfurization ability, so high-silicon steel is generally smelted in an electric furnace.

    用平炉炼出高矽钢
    新华社太原3日电　太原钢铁厂的炼钢工人在创造了三槽出钢法以后，4月份又作出新的成就。这个厂的三号平炉职工克服多槽平炉不能冶炼合金钢的困难，4月27日正式试炼成功了第一炉低矽钢，成分完全合乎标准。接着，青年炉的职工们打破常规，也用平炉试验炼出第一炉高矽钢。高矽钢要求硫的成分非常低，而平炉本身去硫能力很差，所以炼高矽钢一般都用电炉。
