Xinhua News Agency, 15th: China's first demonstration small-scale synthetic petroleum plant, suitable for county and township operation, was officially put into production in Beijing today.

This factory was built by the Ministry of Petroleum Industry to create experience in developing local synthetic petroleum plants. It consists of two dry distillation piles and can produce 300 tons of shale crude oil annually. It is also equipped with processing equipment to refine into kerosene, light gasoline, heavy diesel, crude wax, coke, and other products. In addition, it can recover more than 150 tons of liquid ammonium sulfate annually.

This demonstration factory began construction in mid-April. From groundbreaking to official production, it only took one month, with a total investment of approximately 27,000 yuan. Its main equipment, such as boiler-camel machines, pumps, and ventilators, can be manufactured by ordinary local machinery factories. The dry distillation piles, washing towers, and oil storage tanks are mostly brick and wood structures. Therefore, the steel required for all equipment is less than 20 tons. If local construction can be based on the principles of adapting to local conditions and using local materials, investment and steel can be further saved.

The raw material used by this factory is oil shale, which is available in many parts of China. Due to simple operation, the factory's three shifts require only 60 workers, most of whom only need ordinary workers, and the other few technicians can operate after short-term training.

### 县办石油厂的样板做好了  石油部建设的示范性小型人造石油厂投入生产   投资二万七千元建设一个月年产原油三百吨

　　县办石油厂的样板做好了
　　石油部建设的示范性小型人造石油厂投入生产
    投资二万七千元建设一个月年产原油三百吨
    据新华社15日讯　我国第一座示范性的、适宜于县乡办的小型人造石油厂今天在北京正式投入生产。
    这座工厂是石油工业部为创造发展地方人造石油厂的经验而建设的。它由两个干馏堆组成，每年能产三百吨页岩原油；还设有加工设备，可以炼制成汽灯油、轻汽油、重柴油和粗蜡、焦炭等产品。此外，每年还能收回一百五十多吨液体硫氨。
    这座示范工厂是在4月中旬开始建设的，从破土开工到正式投入生产，前后只有一个月，全部投资约两万七千元左右。它的主要设备像锅驼机、泵、抽风机等，普通地方机械工厂都能制造；干馏堆、洗涤塔、储油罐等，大部分是砖木结构。因此，全部器材设备所需钢材不到二十吨；地方建设时如能根据因地制宜和就地取材的原则，投资和钢材还可以进一步节省。
    这座工厂所用的原料，也是我国很多地方都有的油母页岩。由于操作简单，全厂三班生产需用的六十多个工人，大多数只需普通工人，其他少数技术工人也只要经过短期训练就能操作。
