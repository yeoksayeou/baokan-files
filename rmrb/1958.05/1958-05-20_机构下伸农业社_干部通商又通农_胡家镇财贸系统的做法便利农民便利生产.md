Chengdu, May 19th (reporting from this newspaper) – The experience of Hujia Town, Longchang County, Sichuan Province, in extending financial and trade institutions to agricultural cooperatives, with financial and trade staff being skilled in both commerce and agriculture and considering production in every aspect, has attracted the attention of the commercial authorities of Sichuan Province and is now being gradually promoted in rural areas throughout the province.

Hujia Town is an ordinary rural primary market in Sichuan Province. Traditionally, farmers here went to the market every three days. However, since the great leap forward in agricultural production last winter, farmers have been very busy with production and have less time to go to market, so the original market day was changed from every three days to every seven days. As a result, great changes have taken place in the rural economy. It is not as convenient as before for farmers to buy the "seven necessities" and sell "goods from every household." Stores in the market towns have experienced a downturn in business on ordinary days and congestion on market days, with farmers having to queue to buy goods, and the turnover of various industries has dropped sharply. Therefore, local farmers have requested the extension of the commercial network.

Based on the opinions of the masses, the leaders of Hujia Town first started with the supply and marketing cooperative, which has the closest relationship with the farmers. Based on the principle of facilitating farmers' buying and selling and supporting agricultural production, they organized the extension of the commercial network and put forward the idea of establishing a political, production, and mass viewpoint in their work. The supply and marketing cooperative set up nineteen service stores in the twenty-two villages in its business area, as an integral part of the agricultural cooperative, under the dual leadership of the supply and marketing cooperative and the agricultural cooperative. The agricultural cooperative is responsible for the overall leadership of the administrative management, ideological education, and purchasing and sales activities of each service store, and strives to closely integrate commerce and agriculture, purchasing and sales. For example, the small commodities, straw sandals, and lamp wicks that farmers needed in the past but the supply and marketing cooperative did not sell are now being supplied. The supply objects of each service store are different due to varying economic conditions. After adjusting the commercial network, the business varieties are adjusted according to the local economic situation. Although the service stores do not sell cotton cloth, large department stores, and other commodities, in order to facilitate the masses to buy nearby, they also adopt the method of reservation, agency, or organizing market town stores to supply regularly at fixed points. It is much more convenient for farmers to sell poultry and eggs on a daily basis and exchange them for pocket money to buy oil and salt than it was in the past. After the extension of the commercial network, the business situation of the supply and marketing cooperative has improved rapidly, the turnover has increased, and the blindness in management has been basically overcome; farmers can buy goods more conveniently, saving about 10,000 working days per year.

Starting from promoting production and improving business, the Hujia Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative paid special attention to the "redness and expertise" of cadres after adjusting the commercial network. On the one hand, they strengthened ideological education, and on the other hand, they required cadres to master agricultural technology in connection with their own business. For example, local farmers found it difficult to technically process phosphate rock powder and were unwilling to use it. The supply and marketing cooperative organized all cadres to learn phosphate rock powder processing technology and helped the agricultural cooperative train 1,000 phosphate rock powder technicians. Then, through the method of everyone doing experimental fields, the members were able to see with their own eyes that the use of phosphate rock powder could increase production, which opened up the sales of phosphate rock powder. The technology of operating rural small native products and Chinese medicinal materials is relatively high, so they learned from farmers who grow medicinal materials and herbal medicine vendors. Now, the relevant personnel can not only identify the varieties, properties, and grades of medicinal materials, but also master some of the processing techniques of medicinal materials.

The cadres of the supply and marketing cooperative participate in agricultural production on the one hand, and do their own work on the other, so that financial and trade work can better serve production. For example, this year, the local area plans to plant hundreds of thousands of camellia trees, tung trees, castor beans, bamboo, and other cash crops, requiring a large number of seeds and seedlings. Commercial cadres participate in production, maintain regular contact with their departments, and quickly find ways to supply seeds to farmers, and there are special personnel responsible for guiding cultivation. For some small-scale local specialties that were not included in the plan in the past, the supply and marketing cooperative also helped the agricultural cooperative overcome the difficulties in developing sideline occupations through methods such as ordering contracts and pre-purchasing, so that farmers in the whole region increased their income.

In order to adapt to the new situation of the extension of the rural commercial network, the work of various financial and trade units also needs to be changed accordingly. The handicraft industry, post and telecommunications, banks, and other three departments in Hujia Town also adopted the method of extension. The bank business office established fourteen credit stations, the handicraft industry established eight agricultural tool repair and assembly stations/groups, the post and telecommunications office established twelve mail exchange boxes, and the sewing and hairdressing industries in the market town also sent people down to sew clothes and cut hair for farmers. In the past, farmers had to travel 10 to 20 li to deposit money. After the establishment of the stations, they can generally deposit money without leaving the village. Damaged agricultural tools can be repaired in the fields; each agricultural cooperative has daily mail delivery, and it is more convenient to send letters, pick up newspapers and periodicals, and pick up remittances than in the past.

Now, the Hujia Town Supply and Marketing Cooperative and other relevant departments are still continuing to study and improve, preparing to combine the four networks of supply and marketing, banks, post offices, and handicrafts into one, with the commercial network as the center, and the other three networks revolve around this center. In this way, it will not only facilitate farmers but also enable relevant departments to better cooperate. (Fan Sui)

　　机构下伸农业社　干部通商又通农
    胡家镇财贸系统的做法便利农民便利生产
    本报成都19日电　四川省隆昌县胡家镇把财贸机构下伸到农业社，财贸工作人员既通商、又通农，处处为生产着想的经验，已经引起四川省商业主管部门的重视，目前正逐步在省内各地农村推广。
    胡家镇是四川省一个普通农村初级市场。历来，这里的农民每三天赶一次场。但是，去年冬季农业生产大跃进以来，农民生产很忙，赶场的时间少，原有的场期由三天改为七天。这样一来，农村经济生活就起了很大的变化，农民要就近买到“开门七件事”的商品和出售
  “千家货”，不如过去方便了；而集镇上的商店却出现平时营业清淡，赶场天拥挤，农民买货需要排班站队，各个行业的营业额急剧下降的现象。因此当地农民要求商业网下伸。
    胡家镇领导上根据群众的意见，首先从和农民关系最密切的供销社着手，本着便利农民买卖东西、支援农业生产的原则，组织商业网下伸，提出在工作中树立起政治观点、生产观点和群众观点。供销社在所管的业务区二十二个村中，设置了十九个服务商店，作为农业社的一个组成部分，由供销社和农业社双重领导。各服务商店的行政管理、思想教育和购销活动由所属农业社负责全面领导，尽量把商和农、购和销密切结合起来。如过去农民需要而供销社没有经营的小百货、草鞋、灯草，现在已经开始供应。各个服务商店的供应对象经济条件有所不同，调整商业网后，即根据地区经济情况，调整经营品种；服务商店虽然不经营棉布、大百货等商品，但为了方便群众就近购买，也采取预约、代办或组织场镇商店定时定点供应的办法。农民日常卖家禽、蛋类，换取零钱买油盐，比过去大大方便。商业网下伸后，供销社的营业情况迅速好转，营业额上升，经营上的盲目性也基本上克服；农民买货方便，每年大约可以节约一万个劳动日。
    从促进生产，改进业务出发，胡家镇供销社在调整商业网后，特别注意干部的“红与专”。一方面加强进行思想教育，一方面要求干部结合本身业务、掌握农业技术。如当地农民对磷矿粉的技术处理感到困难，不愿意使用。供销社就组织全体干部学习磷矿粉处理技术，并且帮助农业社训练了一千名磷矿粉技术员，然后通过人人搞试验田的方法，让社员们亲眼看到使用磷矿粉能增产的事实，结果打开了磷矿粉的销路。经营农村小土产、中药材的技术性比较大，他们就向种药材的农民和草药商贩学习，现在有关的人员不但能鉴别药材的品种、性能、级别，而且还掌握了一些药材的加工技术。
    供销社干部一面参加农业生产，一面做本部门工作，使财贸工作更好地为生产服务。如今年当地规划种植几十万株茶子树、桐树、以及蓖麻、竹子等经济作物，需要大量种子、树苗。商业干部参加生产，经常同本部门保持联系，很快就设法把种子供给农民，并且有专人负责指导培植。对一些过去没有纳入计划的小宗土特产，供销社也通过订合同、预购等办法，帮助农业社克服发展副业中的困难，使全区农民增加收入。
    为适应农村商业网下伸的新情况，各个财贸单位的工作也需要相应的改变。胡家镇的手工业、邮电、银行等三个部门，也采取了下伸的办法。银行营业所建立了十四个信用站，手工业建立了八个农具修配站、组，邮电所建立了十二个邮件交换信箱，集镇的缝纫业、理发业也派人下去为农民缝衣、理发。以前，农民存款要走一、二十里，建站以后一般不出村就可以存款，损坏的农具在田边就能修理；每个农业社日通邮一次，寄信、取报刊、取汇款都比过去方便。
    现在，胡家镇供销社等有关部门，还在继续研究改进，准备把供销、银行、邮局、手工业这四个网拧成一股绳，其中以商业网为中心，其它三个网都围绕这个中心活动。这样，既便利了农民又能使有关部门更好地协作。　（范眭）
