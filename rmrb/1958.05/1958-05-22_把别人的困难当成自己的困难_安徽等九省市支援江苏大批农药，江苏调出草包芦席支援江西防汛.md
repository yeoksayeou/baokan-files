    Treat the Difficulties of Others as Your Own
    Nine Provinces and Cities Including Anhui Support Jiangsu with Large Quantities of Pesticides; Jiangsu Transfers Straw Sacks and Reed Mats to Support Jiangxi Flood Control

    (Our report) *Xin Hua Daily* reported: The wheat in the areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province has recently suffered from stem rust and scab due to excessive rain. Upon hearing this news, fraternal provinces actively supported them with large quantities of pesticides. As of May 18th, nine provinces and cities, including Anhui, Henan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Guangdong, and Shanghai, had transported nearly 30 million jin of sulfur powder and sulfur blocks, basically meeting the current needs.

    The fraternal provinces and cities demonstrated a noble communist spirit in supporting these pesticides. The Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Party Committee, who was attending the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in Beijing, immediately sent a telegram back to instruct the allocation of pesticides upon hearing about the wheat diseases in Jiangsu Province. The Henan Provincial Department of Commerce also received instructions from the Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee from Beijing.

    *Xin Hua Daily* also published an editorial on this matter. The editorial stated: "The noble communist spirit of the fraternal provinces and cities has profoundly educated us. In addition to expressing our gratitude for this selfless support from the fraternal provinces and cities, we should also learn from this communist spirit of mutual support and cooperation. Our support for the people of Jiangxi Province with large quantities of straw sacks and reed mats for flood control is one example. At the same time, within our province, between cities and rural areas, between special zones, between cities, between counties, between townships, between communes, between factories, and between departments, we should also promote this communist spirit of cooperation, treat the difficulties of others as our own, treat the victories of others as our own, and actively play our role in socialist large-scale cooperation."

    The editorial pointed out: "Although private ownership has been basically eliminated today, the viewpoints and consciousness of private ownership still remain in people's minds. This ideological influence of private ownership, when manifested in cooperation issues, is localism. People with localist thinking do not regard socialism as a whole, and do not support others with a spirit of self-sacrifice. Instead, they only proceed from the local interests of their own unit. This kind of thinking is inconsistent with the socialist spirit of cooperation. We should use the example of the selfless support of our province by fraternal provinces and cities to educate comrades with localist thinking, so that they understand that unwillingness to implement socialist large-scale cooperation is essentially a manifestation of a lack of communist spirit."

    Furthermore, since the 15th, commercial departments in Jiangsu Province have successively transferred more than 357,000 straw sacks and 100,000 reed mats and other flood control materials to support the people of Jiangxi Province in their struggle against floods.

    Since the beginning of May, heavy rains have fallen continuously in various parts of Jiangxi Province, and the water levels of the Gan River, Fu River, and other rivers have risen sharply. Mountain floods have occurred in some areas, and the situation is quite urgent. After hearing this news on the 13th of this month, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Commerce immediately sent telegrams to the commercial bureaus of Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Wujin and other counties, requesting that they transfer as much straw sacks, reed mats and other flood control materials as possible to support Jiangxi.

### 把别人的困难当成自己的困难  安徽等九省市支援江苏大批农药，江苏调出草包芦席支援江西防汛

    把别人的困难当成自己的困难
    安徽等九省市支援江苏大批农药，江苏调出草包芦席支援江西防汛
    本报讯　新华日报报道：江苏省沿江地区的三麦因近来多雨发生秆锈病和赤霉病，各兄弟省闻讯后，纷纷主动支援大批农药。到5月18日为止，已有安徽、河南、四川、山西、陕西、江西、辽宁、广东、上海等九个省市，共计运来硫磺粉和硫磺块近三千万斤，基本上适应目前的需要。
    各兄弟省、市在支援这批农药中，表现了高尚的共产主义精神。安徽省委书记在北京参加中共八大二次会议，听到江苏省麦子发生病害的消息，随即打电报回去指示调拨农药。河南省商业厅也接到河南省委书记从北京发去的指示。
    新华日报并为此发表了社论。社论说：兄弟省市的这种高尚的共产主义精神，深刻地教育了我们。对于各兄弟省市这种无私的支援，除了感谢之外，我们还应该学习这种相互支援、相互协作的共产主义精神。我们以大批草包和芦席支援江西省人民防汛，就是一个例子。同时，在我们省内，在城市与农村、专区与专区、市与市、县与县、乡与乡、社与社、厂与厂、部门与部门之间，也应该发扬这种共产主义的协作精神，把别人的困难当成自己的困难，把别人的胜利当成自己的胜利，在社会主义大协作中，积极地发挥自己的作用。
    社论指出：今天私有制虽然已经基本消灭，但是私有制的观点、意识还残存在人的身上。这种私有制的思想影响，表现在协作问题上，就是本位主义。有本位主义思想的人，不是把社会主义看成为一个整体，不是以自我牺牲的精神去支持别人，而是一切只从本单位的局部利益出发。这种思想，跟社会主义协作精神是不相符的。我们应该用兄弟省市无私地支援我省的范例，教育有本位主义思想的同志，使他们懂得：不愿意实行社会主义大协作，实质上就是缺乏共产主义精神的表现。
    又讯　江苏省商业部门自15日起，已陆续调出三十五万七千多只草包、十万张芦席等防汛器材，支援江西省人民向洪水作斗争。
    5月初以来，江西省各地连降大雨，赣江、抚河等水位急剧上涨。有些地区发生了山洪，情况相当紧急。江苏省商业厅在本月13日听到这个消息后，当天即发电报给松江、金山、青浦、武进等县商业局，要求将可以调出的草包、芦席等防汛器材，尽量调出支援江西。
