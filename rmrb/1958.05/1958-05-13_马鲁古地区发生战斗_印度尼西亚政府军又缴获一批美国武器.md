Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 12th: An Indonesian Army spokesman announced on the evening of the 11th that government forces and rebels had clashed on May 9th in Jilolo and Titileka on the Maluku Islands of eastern Indonesia. The details are not yet clear.

The Army spokesman said that government forces sank rebel ships in the fighting at Jilolo. In the fighting at Titileka, government forces seized some brand-new American-marked weapons from the rebels.

Army Headquarters also received a report from the Maluku-West Irian defense zone stating that in some areas, ships flying the Dutch flag have recently been assisting rebel activities. A captured rebel confessed that he personally witnessed two "colonels" from Chiang Kai-shek's clique in Manado, North Sulawesi.

Jilolo is an important city on Halmahera Island, the largest of the Maluku Islands, and faces the Minahasa region of North Sulawesi, which is occupied by rebels, across the sea. The fighting in Jilolo indicates that after occupying Morotai Island, the northernmost of the Maluku Islands, the rebels are attempting to further invade the Maluku region.

Jakarta sources believe that the rebels and foreign interventionists are clearly planning to occupy the Maluku region in order to link the Philippines with North Sulawesi, Maluku, and West Irian.

　　马鲁古地区发生战斗
    印度尼西亚政府军又缴获一批美国武器
    据新华社雅加达12日电　印度尼西亚陆军发言人在11日晚间宣布，政府军和叛乱分子9日在印度尼西亚东部马鲁古群岛上的济罗罗和提塔勒卡发生了战斗。详细情况还不清楚。
    陆军发言人说，政府军在济罗罗的战斗中击沉了叛军的船只。在提塔勒卡的战斗中，政府军从叛军手中缴获了一些崭新的带有美国标记的武器。
    陆军总部还接到马鲁古—西伊里安防区的报告说，在一些地区，最近有一些悬挂荷兰旗的船只帮助叛乱分子进行活动。一名被俘的叛乱分子供称，他在北苏拉威西的万鸦老亲眼看到了两名蒋介石集团的“上校”。
    济罗罗是马鲁古群岛中最大的哈马黑拉岛上的重要城市，同北苏拉威西叛乱分子盘据的米那哈沙地区隔海相望。济罗罗的战斗表明，叛乱分子在侵占了马鲁古群岛最北端的摩罗泰岛以后，企图继续侵入马鲁古地区。
    雅加达人士认为，叛乱分子和外国干涉者显然计划占领马鲁古地区，以便把菲律宾同北苏拉威西、马鲁古以及西伊里安联成一片。
