How Was the Two-Wheel Two-Share Plow Popularized?
　　Yao Hongxian, Secretary of the CPC Jiangkou County Committee, Guizhou Province
    Jiangkou County, Guizhou Province, has basically achieved the use of new-style agricultural implements. The county has promoted 4,463 new-style agricultural implements such as two-wheel two-share plows (an average of one new-style agricultural implement for every 46 mu of land), replacing more than 90,000 old-style plows. In the past, mentioning the two-wheel two-share plow had a very bad reputation, saying it was heavy, clumsy, and a piece of scrap iron. In short, it couldn't be used in mountainous areas. Now the masses sing praises of the two-wheel two-share plow: "In the past, the two-wheel two-share plow hung on the wall, old-style agricultural implements worked the fields; now old-style agricultural implements hang high, new-style agricultural implements fill the fields." The county now has 9,339 agricultural implement operators of two-wheel two-share plows (including 5,452 female agricultural implement operators). Not only can young men and women use new-style agricultural implements, but many elderly and young commune members can also skillfully use the two-wheel two-share plow.
    The large-scale promotion and use of the two-wheel two-share plow in Jiangkou County was not smooth sailing. In 1955, when the first four two-wheel two-share plows appeared in Jiangkou County, some cadres and masses with conservative ideas did not welcome this new thing. Huang Guangyou, the production team leader of Da'ao Cooperative in Bapan Township, said: "The two-share plow is a cattle and human labour killer. I never want to see it in my life." When some young technicians went to plow the fields, the cooperative only gave them a blind ox. When the county held a model worker conference, we awarded the new-style agricultural implement to the Yang Yuqing mutual aid team in Bapan Township. After they took it back, the peasants instead said: "What kind of reward is this? It's a waste of my twenty-odd yuan! It would be more useful to buy some plowshares!" This new-style agricultural implement was left in the corner of the house for three years, and even the rice straw used to tie it up was not untied. At that time, there were cries everywhere that "the new-style plow is too heavy," "it's not suitable for the characteristics of mountainous areas," and "it can't be used in the fields." Some areas simply returned it or sold it. Taoying District alone folded ten two-share plows into iron to sell. When we were feeling thorny about the two-share plow, the Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative notified us to return the two-share plow. The document stated that due to the complex terrain of our province, many fields were small in area, and the promotion in the first half of the year lacked in-depth investigation and understanding, resulting in a level-by-level distribution, so that the new-style agricultural implements were not put into use. Therefore, the sold two-share plows could be "returned." Facing this situation of "the superiors want to return them, the inferiors don't use them," and "attacks from both above and below," should we resist? Should we return them? Or should we vigorously promote them? This question was put on the important agenda of the county party committee, and a county party committee meeting was held. A total of eleven members participated in this county party committee meeting. At that time, it was decided not to return them, and seven people firmly expressed their intention to vigorously promote them; the remaining four people's thinking was not clear, and they held a skeptical attitude. Some comrades said: "The two-share plow is simply not suitable for the high-slope mountainous areas, it would be better to simply return it." However, most of the county party committee comrades believed that this was a struggle between the advanced and the backward; the emergence of the two-wheel two-share plow, like the emergence of other new things, would always encounter many obstacles; to make the masses believe in the benefits of the two-wheel two-share plow, the key lies in the leaders taking the lead in doing it themselves, setting an example, and educating the masses with practical examples. After debate, the county party committee's thinking was basically unified, and the meeting decided that the attitude towards the two-wheel two-share plow was not "return" but "promote."
    The measures we took were: personally taking the lead in going to the fields to learn the technology. We chose Xinjiang Agricultural Cooperative in Bapan Township, which was clamoring that new-style agricultural implements could not be used, as an experiment, and organized a youth new-style agricultural implement use team. The county party committee relied on a part of active young commune members to conduct comparative experiments between new and old agricultural implements. Tian Shikui, the captain of the youth new-style agricultural implement use team, after several days of hard study, could plow up to five mu every day. However, other commune members were not convinced of "losing," so they selected five old plowmen and the members of the new-style agricultural implement use team to compete to see who plowed deeper and faster. One day, commune members Yang Fuguang, Tang Shigui, and others, used five old-style plows and five oxen, while the new-style agricultural implement operator Tian Shikui used two oxen and one two-wheel two-share plow, to compete in the same field. As a result, Tian Shikui plowed six mu in one day, while the five commune members using old-style plows only plowed five mu. In comparison, new-style agricultural implements increased labor efficiency more than five times. This comparison made most of the masses happy, realizing the benefits of new-style agricultural implements, and those with conservative ideas also admitted defeat. Driven by the new-style agricultural implement use team, more and more people learned to use new-style agricultural implements.
    After this experiment was successful, the county party committee further increased its confidence in promotion, affirming that the claim that "new-style agricultural implements cannot be promoted" was unfounded. It resolved to take revolutionary action, resolutely fight against all conservative ideas, sweep away the stagnant atmosphere of being content with the status quo, and profoundly educate the masses with vivid examples and concrete facts.
    Organizing on-site visits and letting cadres go to the fields to learn was an important key to opening up the situation for promoting new-style agricultural implements. In the spring of 1956, with Bapan Township, which had a relatively good technical foundation, as the focus, the team organized the team cadres of each society in the township to visit and study the first new-style agricultural implement use team in the county - Xinjiang Society. In this on-site visit and study, four county party committee members, five district party committee secretaries, twenty-five branch secretaries, the heads of technical promotion stations, key cooperative directors, and youth league branch secretaries, a total of sixty-six people, first learned to use the two-wheel two-share plow. After the visit, new-style agricultural implement training classes were held through them in districts and townships. Since then, the reputation of the two-wheel two-share plow has been restored.
    Although district and township leading cadres had initially learned to use the two-wheel two-share plow, the ideological situation of the broad masses of cadres and the people was still complex. We adopted the method of evaluation and debate to solve ideological problems. At the 1957 county four-level cadre conference, Taoying District and Chazhai District were compared and debated. Taoying District has six townships, with a total of 6,352 households, and 70% of the land is flat plains. It can be said that the work of promoting new-style agricultural implements should be much smoother. However, due to the lack of attention from the person in charge of the district, only 61 new-style agricultural implements of various types were promoted in the entire district in 1957, and 17 agricultural cooperatives were still blank spots for new-style agricultural implements last year. On the other hand, Chazhai District, a high-cold mountainous area with two townships and 1,880 households, promoted 335 new-style agricultural implements in the entire district in 1957 because they solved the ideological problems of district, township, society, and team cadres. After evaluation and debate, the cadres' thinking was liberated, so Taoying District increased from the original 61 new-style agricultural implements to 100.
    In order to make new-style agricultural implements universally used, the county party committee also summarized and promoted the experience of Xinjiang and other societies in organizing youth new-style agricultural implement use teams, and implemented four fixities and one rationality (fixed plowing cattle, farmland, people, agricultural implements, and reasonable work points). This found the knack for promoting new-style agricultural implements, and the work was carried out smoothly. A total of 233 youth new-style agricultural implement use teams have been organized throughout the county. This organization played a breakthrough leading role in the process of promoting new-style agricultural implements.
    After the above-mentioned tortuous process, people felt that the two-wheel two-share plow was very appealing, and the two-wheel two-share plow became popular. Cooperative in high-slope mountain gullies all scrambled to buy new-style agricultural implements. During last year's autumn harvest, the supply and marketing cooperative departments transferred 79 two-share plows and 362 one-share plows without wheels from Tongren County. 167 members of the new-style agricultural implement use team in Dewang Township led 95 oxen to wait by the highway. As soon as the cars arrived, they lifted the agricultural implements down to plow the fields. After the autumn harvest, 51,000 mu of land in the county was plowed using new-style agricultural implements, accounting for 32% of the total area of small-season cultivated land. During this year's spring plowing, more than 95% of the fields were plowed with new-style agricultural implements, generally plowing to a depth of six or seven inches.
    The use of new-style agricultural implements can greatly develop agricultural production and ensure increased production. This is the conclusion drawn by the cadres and the vast majority of peasants in Jiangkou County from many comparisons. Last year, the Zhaiba youth technical team of Xinjiang Society, using the two-share plow to plow 36 mu of land, harvested an average of 705 jin per mu; the 9 mu of land plowed with the old plow averaged only 507 jin per mu. Due to the promotion of new-style agricultural implements, coupled with other reasons, the total grain output and yield per mu increased year by year. In 1956, the farmland using new-style agricultural implements in the county accounted for 12.5% of the cultivated land area. In that year, the grain yield per mu reached 470 jin, and the total output increased by 13.8% compared with 1955. In 1957, the farmland using new-style agricultural implements reached 54%, an increase of 91% compared with 1956, the grain yield per mu increased to 612 jin, and the total output increased by 15%. Therefore, everyone was convinced of the benefits of using new-style agricultural implements.
    Another benefit of using two-wheel two-share plows and other new-style agricultural implements is that they plow deeper, plow faster, and have high work efficiency, saving labor and animal power. Because the operation of new-style agricultural implements is not laborious, now more and more women, teenagers, and elderly commune members have learned to use the two-share plow. In this way, a large number of laborers are saved. In previous years, during the spring plowing season, people and cattle were pulled everywhere, and human and animal power were greatly insufficient; this year, 70% of women used new-style agricultural implements, which not only solved the problem of the tension of human and animal power in spring plowing, but also freed up 3,985 male full laborers to invest in local industrial production.
    Now, in the busy spring plowing production movement, the broad masses of peasants are carrying out spring plowing production while actively creating and improving agricultural implements, forming a mass upsurge of agricultural implement reform. This is the bud of technological revolution. The contradiction between production requirements and insufficient labor can never be solved simply by taking measures to strengthen labor intensity. The key issue lies in moving from semi-mechanization to mechanization. There are 170 kinds of agricultural implements and tools such as wheel-less two-share plows, wooden wheel-less one-share plows, wooden-wheel two-share plows, and two-share plows for both harrowing and plowing that have been successfully tested and are being promoted for use throughout the county, and must be further improved, enhanced, and promoted.
    We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, implementing the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, going all out, and striving for the upstream, Jiangkou County will surely realize semi-mechanization and mechanization within three years ahead of schedule.

　　双轮双铧犁是怎样推广的？
　　中共贵州省江口县委书记　姚洪显
    贵州省江口县已经基本上实现了新式农具化。全县推广了双轮双铧犁等新式农具四千四百六十三部（平均每四十六亩地就有一部新式农具），代替了九万多件旧式犁。过去提起双轮双铧犁，名誉臭得很，说它又重、又笨是一块废铁。一句话，就是在山区不能用。现在群众歌唱双轮双铧犁是：“过去双轮双铧犁壁上挂，旧式农具把田下，如今旧式农具高高挂，新式农具满田坝”。全县已有双轮双铧犁农具手九千三百三十九人（其中有女农具手五千四百五十二人），不仅男女青年会使用新式农具，许多的老年社员和少年也都能熟练地使用双轮双铧犁。
    双轮双铧犁在江口县能够大量的推广使用起来，并不是一帆风顺的。1955年，当四部双轮双铧犁第一次出现在江口县的时候，干部和群众中有保守思想的一些人，对这个新东西并不是欢迎的。坝盘乡大坳社的生产队长黄光友说：“双铧犁是磨牛磨人王，我一辈子也不愿见它。”有的青年技术队队员去牵牛犁田时，合作社只给一头瞎牛。县里开劳模会时，我们把新式农具奖给坝盘乡杨玉清互助组，他们拿回去后，农民们反而说：“啥奖励，冤花了我那二十多块！倒不如买点铧口还顶用哩！”这部新式农具在屋角里放了三年，连捆农具的稻草都没有解开。那时，到处叫喊“新式犁太重”，“不适合山区特点”，“不能下田”。个别地区干脆把它退回，或者卖掉。光是桃映区就将十部双铧犁折成铁拿去卖了。当我们拿着双铧犁正感到棘手的时候，省里供销合作社通知叫退双铧犁。文件里说什么由于我省地形复杂，很多田土的面积很小，同时在上半年的推广中，缺乏深入的调查了解，以致形成逐级分推，使新式农具未使用起来，因此，可以将已销售的双铧犁“退货”。面对着这种“上要退，下不使”，“上下夹攻”的局面，是顶住呢？是退回去呢？还是大力推广呢？这个问题就提到了县委会的重要议事日程上来了，于是便召开了一次县委会。参加这次县委会的共有十一个委员。当时决定不退，坚决表示要大力推广的有七人；其余四人思想不通，抱着半信半疑的态度。有的同志说：“双铧犁就是不适合于高坡山区，干脆退了还好一点。”然而大部分的县委同志认为：这是先进与落后的斗争；双轮双铧犁的出现也和其它新事物的出现一样，总是会碰到许多阻碍的；要使群众相信双轮双铧犁的好处，关键就在于领导亲自动手，做出榜样，以实例教育群众。经过辩论，县委的思想基本上统一了，会议决定对双轮双铧犁的态度，不是“退”而是“推”。
    我们采取的措施是：亲自带头下地学技术。选择了叫喊新式农具不能用的坝盘乡新江农业社作试验，组织了一个青年新式农具使用队。县委就依靠一部分积极的青年社员，进行了新旧农具对比的试验。青年新式农具使用队的队长田世魁，经过几天苦学以后，每天可以犁到五亩。但是其它社员不服“输”，他们选了五个老犁手和新式农具使用队的社员们比赛，看谁犁得深，犁得快。一天，社员杨福光、唐世贵等五个人，用五架旧式犁、五头牛，新式农具手田世魁一人用两头牛、一架双轮双铧犁，在同样的一坝田里进行比赛。结果田世魁一天犁了六亩，而那五个使用旧式犁的社员才犁了五亩。两者相比，新式农具要比旧式犁提高劳动效率五倍多。这一比，使大多数的群众高兴了，认识到新式农具的好处，那些有保守思想的人也就服输了。在新式农具使用队的带动下，越来越多的人学会了使用新式农具。
    这次试验成功以后，县委更增加了推广的信心，肯定那种叫喊“新式农具不能推广”的说法是没有根据的。决心采取革命的行动，坚决与一切保守思想作斗争，扫除安于现状的暮气，以活人活事具体事例，深刻地教育群众。
    组织实地参观，让干部下田学习，这是打开推广新式农具局面的重要一关。1956年春天，以技术基础较好的坝盘乡为重点，组织该乡各个社的社干到全县的第一个新式农具使用队——新江社去参观和学习。在这次实地参观学习中，有四个县委委员、五个区委书记、二十五个支部书记和技术推广站的站长、重点合作社主任、团支部书记等六十六人，首先学会了使用双轮双铧犁。参观之后，通过他们以区乡为单位，举办了新式农具训练班。从此，恢复了双轮双铧犁的名誉。
    区乡领导骨干虽然初步学会了使用双轮双铧犁，但是广大干部和群众的思想情况还是复杂的。我们采取了评比和开展辩论的方法，来解决思想问题。在1957年县四级干部大会上，用桃映区和茶寨区作对比，开展辩论。桃映区有六个乡，共计六千三百五十二户，70％土地是平坝，论说，推广新式农具的工作应该顺利得多。但是由于区的负责人不重视，全区在1957年只推广各种新式农具六十一件，有十七个农业社去年还是新式农具的空白点。而高寒山区的茶寨区两个乡，一千八百八十户，由于他们解决了区、乡、社、队干部的思想问题，1957年全区就推广了新式农具三百三十五部。经过评比辩论，干部的思想解放了，于是桃映区就由原来的六十一部新式农具增加到一百部。
    为了把新式农具普遍地使用起来，县委还总结推广了新江等社组织青年新式农具使用队的经验，实行了四固定一合理（耕牛、田土、人、农具固定，工分合理）。这就找到了推广新式农具的窍门，工作顺利地开展了。全县目前共组织了二百三十三个青年新式农具使用队。这个组织，在推广新式农具的过程中，起到了突击带头作用。
    人们经过上述曲折的过程，感到双轮双铧犁很有味道，双轮双铧犁吃得开了。高坡山沟合作社都争着购买新式农具。去年秋收时，供销合作部门由铜仁县调来双铧犁七十九部、无轮一铧犁三百六十二部，德旺乡新式农具使用队一百六十七人牵起九十五头牛在公路边等，汽车一到，就把农具抬下来犁田。秋收后，全县使用新式农具犁的田就有五万一千亩。占小季耕地面积总数的32％。今年春耕中95％以上的田都是用新式农具犁的，一般都深耕到六、七寸。
    使用新式农具能够使农业生产大发展，确保增产，这是江口县的干部和绝大部分农民从很多的对比中得出来的结论。去年新江社寨坝青年技术队，用双铧犁犁的三十六亩地，平均每亩收七百零五斤；用旧犁犁的九亩地，平均亩产只有五百零七斤。由于推广了新式农具，加上其他原因，粮食总产量和单产一年比一年提高。1956年全县使用新式农具的田土，占耕地面积的12.5％。这年粮食亩产达到四百七十斤，总产量比1955年增产13.8％。1957年使用新式农具的田土达到54％，比1956年增加91％，粮食亩产提高到六百一十二斤，总产量增加15％。因此大家对使用新式农具的好处信服了。
    使用双轮双铧犁等新式农具的另一个好处，是犁得深，犁得快，工作效率高，节约劳力和畜力。由于新式农具的操作不吃力，现在越来越多的妇女、少年以及老年社员都学会了使用双铧犁。这样，就节约了大批的劳动力。往年春耕犁田季节到处是拉人拉牛，人力和畜力大感不足；今年70％的妇女使用了新式农具，不仅春耕中的人力和畜力紧张的问题解决了，而且腾出了三千九百八十五个男全劳动力，投入地方工业生产。
    现在，广大农民在繁忙的春耕生产运动中，一边在进行着春耕生产，一边在积极创造和改良农具，形成了一个群众性的农具改革的高潮。这是技术革命的萌芽。目前生产要求与劳力不足的矛盾，绝不能单纯地采取加强劳动强度的办法来解决，关键问题在于由半机械走上机械化的道路。已经试验成功在全县范围内推广使用的有无轮双铧犁、木制无轮一铧、木轮双铧犁和耙田犁田两用双铧犁等农具和工具一百七十种，必须进一步改进提高和推广。
    我们相信，在党中央和毛主席的领导下，贯彻执行党提出的多快好省，鼓足干劲，力争上游的建设社会主义的总路线，江口县一定能够提前在三年内实现半机械化和机械化。
