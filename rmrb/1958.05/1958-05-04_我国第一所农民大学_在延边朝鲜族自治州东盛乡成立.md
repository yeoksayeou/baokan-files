Xinhua News Agency, Yanji, 3rd. China's first Farmers' University - the Liming (Dawn) Amateur Agricultural University was established on May 1st in Dongsheng Township, Yanji County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. On this day, the first batch of fifty-one Korean farmers as university students received warm congratulations at the opening ceremony from local farmers, leaders of the autonomous prefecture and county leading organs, and students from the Agricultural College of Yanbian University. Jin Shirong, director of the Liming Agricultural Cooperative and vice-principal of the Liming Amateur Agricultural University, said at the opening ceremony: The establishment of this university is the pride of our generation of farmers under the socialist system, and it once again proves the greatness of the Party's ethnic policies. We must participate in production labor with the greatest enthusiasm, and at the same time resolutely overcome the agricultural science fortress to welcome the technological revolution and to thank the Party and Chairman Mao.
    The first batch of fifty-one students were all admitted after passing examinations and strict political and ideological reviews. They are all high school graduates who have been participating in agricultural production for several years, and young farmers and township cadres with a high school education who have been participating in agricultural production or working at the grassroots level for three to eight years. Among them, key members who are production team leaders and above in the agricultural cooperatives account for 35%, and there are also seven female students.
    The Liming Amateur Agricultural University will use spare time to train high-level agricultural science and technology talents who wholeheartedly serve local agricultural production. The study period is three years, divided into six semesters to study politics and twelve professional courses of higher agricultural schools. These courses are: Soil Science, Agricultural Chemistry, Agricultural Production Machinery, Tillage Science, Crop Cultivation, Plant Physiology, Plant Pathology, Agricultural Entomology, Crop Breeding, Pomology and Vegetable Science, Animal Husbandry, etc. The school is led by a board of directors composed of representatives from township and county departments and the Agricultural College of Yanbian University. Eleven lecturers and teaching assistants from the nearby Agricultural College of Yanbian University serve as part-time teachers, and classes are held centrally in the township middle school classrooms for two and a half days a week.
    In recent years, Dongsheng Township has made great progress in production, and its cultural life has become increasingly active. In July 1956, primary school education was universalized throughout the township, and by the end of last year, illiteracy was eliminated among 95% of young and middle-aged farmers. In the past two or three years, nearly two hundred children of farmers have graduated from junior or senior high schools every year, and forty-nine high school graduates have already returned to their hometown to participate in agricultural production. After the socialist education movement last winter and this spring, the farmers' minds have been greatly liberated. While making great leaps forward in production, the 3,324 households of farmers in the eight agricultural cooperatives in the township have newly established seven private junior high schools, senior high schools, and seventeen amateur junior high schools and senior high schools, and have universalized secondary education throughout the township. It is on this basis that they, according to the agricultural development plan, put forward the issue of establishing an amateur agricultural university. After Jin Minghan, Deputy Secretary of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Committee of the Communist Party of China, learned about this requirement in the township, he immediately convened a meeting of the main cadres of the township and cooperatives and the responsible cadres of the county and the Agricultural College of Yanbian University to formally study the matter and established a special agency to begin the preparatory work for the school.

    我国第一所农民大学
    在延边朝鲜族自治州东盛乡成立
    新华社延吉3日电　我国第一所农民大学——黎明业余农业大学1日在延边朝鲜族自治州延吉县东盛乡成立。这一天，第一批五十一名朝鲜族农民大学生在开学典礼上受到了当地农民和自治州、县领导机关首长以及延边大学农学院学生的热烈祝贺。黎明农业社主任、黎明业余农业大学副校长金时龙在开学典礼上说：这所大学的成立，是社会主义制度下的我们一代农民的骄傲，它又一次证实了党的民族政策的伟大。我们要以最大的干劲参加生产劳动，同时坚决攻克农业科学堡垒，来迎接技术革命，来感谢党和  毛主席。
      第一批入学的五十一名学生，都经过了考试和严格的政治思想审查，他们都是几年来参加农业生产的高中毕业生和参加农业生产或参加基层工作三年到八年具有高中文化程度的青年农民和乡干部。其中，农业社生产小组长以上的骨干占35％，还有七名女学生。
    黎明业余农业大学将利用业余时间，培养全心全意为当地农业生产服务的高级农业科学技术人材。学习年限为三年，分六个学期学习政治和十二门高等农业学校的专业课程，这些课程是：土壤学、农业化学、农业生产机械学、耕作学、作物栽培学、植物生理学、植物病理学、农业昆虫学、作物选种学、果树及蔬菜学、畜牧学等。学校由乡、县各部门和延边大学农学院代表组成的理事会领导，教员由邻近的延边大学农学院的十一名讲师和助教兼任，每周以两个半天时间借用乡内中学课堂集中讲课。
    东盛乡这几年来生产有了很大发展，文化生活也日趋活跃。1956年7月，全乡就普及小学教育，去年年底在95％的青壮年农民中扫除了文盲。近两三年来，每年都有近二百名农民子弟从初中或高中毕业，已经回乡参加农业生产的高中毕业生就有四十九名。经过去冬今春的社会主义教育运动，农民思想获得很大解放。全乡八个农业社三千三百二十四户农民在生产大跃进的同时，新设了七所民办初中、高中和十七所业余初中、高中，又在全乡范围内普及了中等教育。就是在这个基础上，他们根据农业发展规划，提出了创办业余农业大学的问题。中共延边朝鲜族自治州委员会副书记金明汉到乡里了解到这种要求后，当天就召集乡社主要干部和县以及延边大学农学院负责干部正式开会研究，并成立专门机构开始建校筹备工作。（附图片）
