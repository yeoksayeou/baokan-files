Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 25th: The Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China decided today to organize a ten-thousand-person agricultural production inspection group to go deep into every township and every commune. The group will both convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC and, in accordance with the spirit of the Eighth National Congress, inspect and promote production, so that rural production, especially current production, will achieve another great leap forward. The inspection group consists of cadres from the provincial, special district, and county levels, with more than 10,000 cadres from the provincial, special district, county, and township levels participating. Among those from provincial-level agencies participating in the inspection group are Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the CPC, Zhao Ziyang, Secretary of the Provincial Committee, Qu Mengjue, Lin Liming, and more than 50 cadres at or above the level of director and deputy director of departments and bureaus. The inspection group is divided into four routes – East, North, West, and Hainan Island – and will depart at the beginning of next month for a 40-day inspection.

Each inspection group, after convening a meeting of county Party secretaries to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the CPC, will immediately divide into groups and go deep into the rural areas, ensuring that they reach every township and every commune. Targeting specific situations, they will use the method of "gentle rain" to convey the spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress, focusing on the socialist construction line of "more, faster, better, and more economical" and the communist style of breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and daring to think, speak, and act. After the conveyance, they will conduct a mass, comprehensive inspection and comparison of the production and work of each township and commune, based on the spirit of the Eighth National Congress and using the "more, faster, better, and more economical" general line as the standard. They will help township and commune cadres summarize experiences, liberate their minds, clarify directions, and come up with solutions, and resolve specific problems on the spot.

During the general inspection, once typical experiences are discovered, they will be vigorously and systematically summarized, and mass meetings will be held on-site, organizing visits and immediately promoting them. The Provincial Party Committee has decided that, during the general inspection, the "cursory observation" method will be adopted; when summarizing and promoting typical experiences, the "in-depth investigation" method of "dissecting the sparrow" will be adopted. Cursory observation and dissecting the sparrow will be carried out simultaneously and combined with each other, but dissecting the sparrow will become the main inspection method.

This inspection is scheduled to solve four aspects of problems: summarizing the experience of early rice high yields, supervising and inspecting the preparatory work for late rice production; arranging autumn and winter production; the rural rectification campaign and commune consolidation; and various forms of work supporting agriculture. Among these, special emphasis will be placed on the systematic summary of early rice high-yield experience, especially the experience of nearly one million mu of high-yield experimental fields. This is in order to encourage the people to dare to think and take measures to increase production several times over; at the same time, it will educate the people to master high-yield technology and promote agricultural technology innovation. The preparatory work for late rice planting in Guangdong Province, such as fertilizer accumulation and seedling cultivation, is now at a critical juncture and will also be included as a key focus of the inspection work.

The Provincial Party Committee has mobilized a group of agricultural scientists, advisors, and professors to participate in this agricultural production inspection group. On the one hand, they will be asked to help collect, organize, and assess the rich experience currently being put into practice, develop science, and promote production; on the other hand, through the inspection, the ideological transformation of these senior intellectuals in the field of agriculture will also be of great benefit.

The Provincial Party Committee has decided to convene a meeting of Party member department and bureau-level cadres in the near future to convey the resolutions of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and mobilize them to prepare for going to the countryside. Other specific work of the inspection group is also being actively prepared.

    传达八大二次会议精神推动农村生产
    广东决定组织万人检查团
    新华社广州25日电　中共广东省委今天决定组织农业生产万人检查团，深入每个乡、每个社，一边传达中共八大二次会议精神，一边根据八大的精神检查生产，推动生产，使农村生产，特别是当前生产再来个大跃进。检查团由省、专区、县三级组成，有省、专区、县、乡四级约一万名以上的干部参加。省级机关参加检查团的，有中共广东省委第一书记陶铸、省委书记赵紫阳，区梦觉，林李明，以及正副厅局长以上干部五十多人。检查团分东、北、西及海南岛四路，于下月初出发，检查时间为四十天。
    各路检查团，在分别召开县委书记会议传达中共八大二次会议的精神后，将立即分组深入农村，作到乡乡到，社社到，针对具体情况，用下毛毛雨的办法，传达八大二次会议精神，其中着重传达“多快好省”的社会主义建设路线和破除迷信、思想解放、敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格。传达以后，即根据八大会议精神以总路线的多快好省为标准，对各乡各社的生产和工作，进行群众性的全面大检查，大评比，帮助乡、社干部总结经验，解放思想，明确方向，想出办法，并就地解决具体问题。
    在一般检查中，发现典型经验后，将大力加以系统总结，并在现场召开群众性的会议，组织参观，立刻推广。省委决定，进行一般性的检查时，采用走马看花的方法；总结和推广典型经验时，采用下马看花，解剖麻雀的方法。走马看花和解剖麻雀同时并举，互相结合，但解剖麻雀将成为主要检查方法。
    此次检查，预定解决：总结早稻丰产经验，督促和检查晚稻生产的准备工作；布置秋季生产和冬季生产；农村整风整社；各种工作支援农业等四个方面的问题。其中将特别强调早稻丰产经验的系统总结工作，尤其是近百万亩丰产试验田的经验。以便借此鼓舞人民，敢于思想，采取措施一倍几倍地增加生产；同时教育人民掌握丰产技术，推进农业技术革新。广东省晚稻播种的准备工作，如积肥和育苗，现在已到紧要关头，也将列入检查工作的重点。
    省委动员了一批农业科学家、顾问、教授，参加此次的农业生产检查团，一方面请他们帮助收集、整理、鉴定目前实践中的丰富的经验，发展科学，促进生产；另一方面，通过检查，对这些农业方面的高级知识分子的思想改造，也有极大好处。
    省委已决定近日召开党员厅局长干部会议，传达八大二次会议决议，动员他们作好下乡准备。检查团的其他具体工作也在积极准备中。
