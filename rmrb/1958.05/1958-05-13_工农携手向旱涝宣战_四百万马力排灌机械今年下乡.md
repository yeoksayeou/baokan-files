Workers and Peasants Join Hands to Declare War on Drought and Flooding
　　Four Million Horsepower of Irrigation and Drainage Machinery Will Be Sent to the Countryside This Year
　　(Dispatch from our newspaper on the 12th) (Our reporter Wang Liang reports): Machine manufacturing workers across the country are displaying unprecedented labor enthusiasm, actively rushing to produce large quantities of irrigation and drainage machinery to support the great leap forward in agricultural production. According to statistics at the end of April, the total irrigation and drainage machinery supplied to rural areas nationwide reached 378,000 horsepower, exceeding the original plan by 27%.
　　The total amount of irrigation and drainage machinery produced in China this year will reach four million horsepower, equivalent to more than six times the total irrigation and drainage machinery in rural areas nationwide in 1957, and forty-one times that of 1949.
　　Supplying such a huge quantity of irrigation and drainage machinery to agriculture in one year is an unprecedented feat in China's socialist construction and a major measure to promote the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft).
　　The National Farmland Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Conference held last December decided that the irrigation and drainage machinery produced in 1958 would be 500,000 horsepower. This figure seemed astonishing enough at the time. By the first quarter of this year, the production plan for irrigation and drainage machinery had jumped to two million horsepower. However, due to the rapid development of the nationwide movement for farmland irrigation construction by the broad masses of farmers, two million horsepower was far from meeting the demand, and therefore the production targets had to be raised again and again.
　　Machine manufacturing workers across the country regard the production of irrigation and drainage machinery as a glorious task to support agriculture. Machine manufacturing plants in many places, whether large or small, and even machine repair workshops in other industrial sectors, internship factories of universities and secondary technical schools, have all joined the ranks of producing irrigation and drainage machinery, actively contributing to the development of agriculture. Factories in Beijing producing irrigation and drainage machinery launched a competition to "see who does the best job, who finishes the earliest, who has the lowest cost, and who uses the least raw materials." Workers in many factories also tried every means to overcome difficulties and innovate technologies to increase production. A machinery factory in Shenyang trial-produced a new type of water tube boiler locomobile, which uses much less steel than the old locomobile.
　　While producing large quantities of irrigation and drainage machinery, many factories in various places have also dispatched or are gradually dispatching large numbers of mechanical workers to the countryside and mountains to help agricultural production cooperatives cultivate technical forces and repair agricultural machinery and irrigation and drainage machinery. Various machinery factories in Shenyang have also established a system of "one factory helping one agricultural cooperative." The central and local industrial departments also regard the production of irrigation and drainage machinery as a primary task. The steel needed for the production of irrigation and drainage machinery is given priority supply. The transportation departments also give priority to transportation.
　　Currently, there are five types of power machines for rural irrigation and drainage: gas engines, diesel engines, locomobiles, gasoline engines, and electric motors. The production ratio of these machines is determined by the supply of raw materials and fuels, whether the machines themselves are economical, durable, and easy to operate, and other conditions. At the National Farmland Irrigation and Agricultural Mechanization Conference held last year, it was believed that the focus of power machinery development in rural areas in China should be on gas engines. As for diesel engines, gasoline engines, electric motors, and locomobiles, due to limitations, it was not advisable to develop them on a large scale. Since the beginning of this year, the situation has undergone new changes. Now, all localities are vigorously developing artificial petroleum industry, and small hydropower stations are being built everywhere in rural areas. In terms of technology, locomobiles can basically use ordinary steel plates instead of boiler steel plates, which are currently not easy to supply in China. Therefore, these types of power machines can now also be developed more.
　　Among the four million horsepower of power machines already determined to be produced this year, gas engines still rank first (33%), followed by diesel engines (26%), locomobiles (24%), electric motors (9%), and gasoline engines (8%).
　　Judging from the current situation, the production potential of factories is very large, and it is entirely possible to complete such a large production task of irrigation and drainage machinery. However, it is still necessary to first solve some of the difficulties that exist in various aspects.
　　In order to promote the rapid development of national water conservancy mechanization and agricultural mechanization, the original practice of unified central arrangement for the production and distribution of irrigation and drainage machinery will be changed. In the future, it will be based on local areas, adopting the method of "unified planning, regional self-sufficiency, mutual assistance among provinces, and central adjustment" to arrange production. The advantage of doing so is that it is convenient to mobilize local manufacturing forces, achieve adapting to local conditions and using local materials, and it is also convenient for technical training and maintenance and repair work after the machines are sent to the countryside.

### 工农携手向旱涝宣战  四百万马力排灌机械今年下乡

　　工农携手向旱涝宣战
    四百万马力排灌机械今年下乡
    本报12日讯　本报记者王良报道：全国各地的机器制造工人正在发挥前所未有的劳动热情，积极赶制大批排灌机械，支援农业生产大跃进。到4月底的统计，全国已经供应农村的排灌机械，达三十七万八千马力，超过了原订计划的27％。
    今年我国生产排灌机械的总数将要达到四百万马力，相当于1957年全国农村所有的排灌机械的六倍多，而为1949年的四十一倍。
    在一年中，供应农业这样巨大数量的排灌机械，这是我国社会主义建设事业上空前的壮举，也是促进全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）早日实现的一项重大措施。
    去年12月召开的全国农田排灌和农业机械化会议决定1958年生产的排灌机械是五十万马力。这个数字在当时看来已经是够惊人的了。到今年第一季度，排灌机械的生产计划就跳到二百万马力。但是由于全国广大农民兴修农田水利的运动飞跃发展，二百万马力也远远不能满足需要，因而生产指标不得不一再提高。
    全国各地的机器制造工人都把生产排灌机械作为支援农业的一项光荣任务。许多地方的机械制造厂不论大厂或小厂，甚至连其他工业部门的机器修理车间、大专学校和中等技术学校的实习工厂，都参加到生产排灌机械的队伍里来，积极为发展农业贡献一分力量。北京市生产排灌机械的工厂展开了“看谁干得好，看谁完成得早，看谁成本低，看谁原材料用得少”的竞赛。许多工厂的工人还千方百计地克服困难，革新技术，以增加产量。沈阳一个机械工厂试制出一种新型的水管锅炉的锅驼机，使用的钢材要比旧的锅驼机减少很多。
    在生产大批排灌机械的同时，各地的许多工厂还派出或正在陆续派出大批的机械工人下乡上山，帮助农业生产合作社培养技术力量，修理农业机械和排灌机械。沈阳各个机械厂还订出“一厂帮一个农业合作社”的制度。中央和各地的工业部门也把排灌机械的生产作为一项首要的任务。生产排灌机械所需要的钢材，都是优先供应。交通运输部门也是优先运送。
      目前，供应农村排灌用的动力机有煤气机、柴油机、锅驼机、汽油机和电动机五种。这几种机器的生产比例是随原材料、燃料的供应情况，机器本身是否经济、耐用、操作简便等条件来决定的。在去年召开全国农田排灌和农业机械化会议时，人们认为目前我国农村动力机械应以发展煤气机为重点，至于柴油机、汽油机、电动机和锅驼机，因受条件限制，都不宜大量发展。今年以来，情况发生了新的变化。现在各地都在大力发展人造石油工业，农村也到处兴建小型水电站，锅驼机在技术上已能基本上做到用一般钢板代替我国目前不易供应的锅炉钢板，因而，这几种动力机现在也可以较多地发展了。
    在已经确定的今年生产四百万马力的动力机中，煤气机仍然占第一位（33％），其次是柴油机（26％），再次是锅驼机（24％）、电动机（9％）和汽油机（8％）。
    从目前的情况看来，工厂的生产潜力是很大的，完成这样大量的排灌机械的生产任务是完全可能的，但是还必须要先解决在各个方面存在的一些困难。
    为了促进全国水利机械化和农业机械化事业的迅速发展，原来排灌机械由中央统一安排生产和分配的做法将要改变。今后将以地方为主，采取“统一规划、分区自给、各省互助、中央调剂”的办法来安排生产。这样做的好处是便于动员当地的制造力量，做到因地制宜和就地取材，也便于机器下乡以后的技术传授和维护修配工作。
