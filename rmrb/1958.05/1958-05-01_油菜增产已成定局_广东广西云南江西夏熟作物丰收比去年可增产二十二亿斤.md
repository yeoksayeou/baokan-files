    Increased Rapeseed Production is a Foregone Conclusion
    Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Jiangxi's Summer Harvest Crops Achieve Bumper Harvest, Potentially Increasing Production by 2.2 Billion Jin Compared to Last Year
    (Our dispatch) By the end of April, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Fujian and other provinces had basically completed the rapeseed harvest, and the early-maturing rapeseed in provinces in the Yangtze River basin and other regions has also begun to be harvested. The majority of the country's 37 million mu of rapeseed grew tall with many pods and full grains. According to relevant estimates, the total output will exceed last year's by about 60% (last year's output was nearly 18 million dan), and the yield per mu can reach about 70 jin (last year it was 50.3 jin).

    The rapeseed harvest in the already harvested areas has increased compared to last year. Yunnan Province's 2.7 million mu of rapeseed generally increased by about 30% compared to last year. Hubei Province's average rapeseed yield per mu is expected to reach 100 jin, with Songzi County averaging 270 jin and the highest reaching 500 jin. Hunan Province's total rapeseed production last year was 1.12 million dan, and this year it is expected to reach 2.4 million dan. Xinghua County in Jiangsu Province had an average yield of 185.4 jin per mu last year, and this year it can reach about 300 jin. Nanzheng County in southern Shaanxi is expected to have an average yield of 200 jin per mu. Guizhou Province, which has the largest rapeseed area in the country at 6.45 million mu, will have a total output of more than 3.8 million dan this year, more than double that of last year. Only Sichuan's rapeseed production will be slightly reduced this year due to the spring drought.

    This year's rapeseed bumper harvest is mainly due to the intensified field management and topdressing during the winter and spring in the Great Leap Forward. Guizhou, Zhejiang, Hubei, and other provinces generally weeded and topdressed rapeseed fields one or two times more this winter and spring than in previous years. Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi used to have the habit of turning over third-class rapeseed seedlings as green manure, and 2-3 million mu were often turned over each year. This year, due to the strengthening of the management of third-class seedlings, not much was turned over.

    (Our dispatch) Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Jiangxi and other provinces have generally completed the harvest of summer crops (wheat, barley, broad beans, peas, and winter sweet potatoes). According to estimates from these four provinces, the total output of summer grain can reach 5 billion jin, an increase of about 2.2 billion jin compared to last year.

    The summer crops in these provinces or some areas of these provinces have had better harvests than in previous years. Taking Guangdong as an example, the total output of wheat, barley, and other crops this year is 700 million jin more than in 1956, the year with the best harvest, and the output of tuber crops has doubled compared to last year. The yield per unit area of wheat in this province this year has also increased from more than 50 jin last year to more than 70 or 80 jin. (Attached picture)

### 油菜增产已成定局  广东广西云南江西夏熟作物丰收比去年可增产二十二亿斤

    油菜增产已成定局
    广东广西云南江西夏熟作物丰收比去年可增产二十二亿斤
    本报讯　广东、广西、江西、福建等省到4月底油菜已基本收完，长江流域各省和其它地区的早熟油菜也已经开始收割。全国三千七百多万亩油菜大部分长得秆高荚多，籽粒饱满。据有关方面估计，总产量将超过去年60％左右（去年产量近一千八百万担），亩产可达七十斤左右（去年为五十点三斤）。
    已经收获的地区今年油菜都比去年增产了。云南省的二百七十多万亩油菜普遍比去年增产三成左右。湖北省油菜平均亩产预计可达一百斤，松滋县平均可达二百七十斤，最高的可达五百斤。湖南省去年油菜籽总产量为一百一十二万担，今年预计可达二百四十万担。江苏省兴化县去年平均亩产为一百八十五点四斤，今年可达三百斤左右。陕南南郑县平均亩产预计也可达二百斤。今年油菜面积达六百四十五万亩，占全国第一的贵州省，今年总产可达三百八十多万担，超过去年一倍以上。今年仅四川油菜因春旱将略为减产。
    今年油菜丰收主要是由于大跃进中，各省都加紧了冬春的田间管理和追肥。贵州、浙江、湖北等省去冬今春油菜田的除草追肥普遍比往年多一、二次。湖北、湖南、江西往年有翻耕油菜三类苗作绿肥的习惯，每年往往被翻耕掉二百—三百万亩。今年由于加强了对三类苗的管理，翻耕不多。
    本报讯　广东、广西、云南、江西等省的夏熟作物（小麦、大麦、蚕豆、豌豆和冬甘薯）已经普遍收获完了。据这四个省的预计，夏熟粮食总产量可以达到五十亿斤，约比去年增产二十二亿斤。
    这些省或这些省的一些地区，今年的夏熟作物收成比往年都好。以广东为例，今年小麦、大麦等作物的总产量比收成最好的1956年还多七亿斤，薯类作物的产量比去年增产两倍。这个省今年的小麦单位面积产量，也由去年的五十多斤提高到七、八十多斤。（附图片）
