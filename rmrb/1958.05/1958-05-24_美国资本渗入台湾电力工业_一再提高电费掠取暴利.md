Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 22nd: Taiwan newspapers report that the Taiwan Power Company, under the penetration of American capital, recently increased electricity prices by 8% across the board for industrial and lighting use. This is the fourth electricity price increase in Taiwan since 1953. After these four price hikes, electricity prices in Taiwan are now 1.2 times higher than in January 1953, increasing the burden on urban residents and the cost of industrial production, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the Taiwanese public.

The Taiwan Power Company's repeated raising of electricity prices to extract wealth from the Taiwanese public is due to the fact that this company has been controlled by the "economic aid" investment of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration's Taiwan branch and the investment of the American Westinghouse Corporation. American monopoly capital demands higher electricity prices to seize exorbitant profits. Currently, the "U.S. Aid" investment in the Taiwan Power Company has reached NT$2 billion (approximately US$50 million), and Westinghouse has also invested US$13.5 million. Both of these investments are attached with harsh conditions. Among them, the annual dividend for the "U.S. Aid" investment is as high as 6%, and the Taiwan Power Company has to pay US$3 million annually just for the dividends on the "U.S. Aid" investment. The dividends on the investment of the American Westinghouse Corporation are even higher.

American monopoly capital has also seized the power to make major personnel appointments and removals in the Taiwan Power Company. The procurement and addition of equipment by the Taiwan Power Company must also be approved by the U.S. side, and it must be designated to be purchased from a specific American company.

The Taiwan Power Company is the enterprise that manages the entire Taiwanese electric power industry, owning 35 power plants. In order to control Taiwan's economic lifeline and seek exorbitant profits, it has been the focus of American economic aggression against Taiwan for several years. (Attached picture)

    美国资本渗入台湾电力工业
    一再提高电费掠取暴利
    新华社广州22日电　台湾报纸报道，美国资本渗透下的台湾电力公司，最近把工业用电和照明用电的电费普遍提高8％。这是台湾从1953年以来的第四次电费加价。经过这四次的加价，现在台湾的电费已经比较1953年1月提高了一点二倍，加重了市镇居民的负担和工业生产的成本，引起台湾公众普遍的不满。
    台湾电力公司一再提高电价来向台湾公众搜刮，是由于这家公司已经被美国国际合作署台湾分署的“经济援助”投资和美国威斯汀豪斯公司的投资所控制，美国垄断资本要求提高电价来攫取暴利。现在台湾电力公司中的“美援”投资已经达二十亿元台币（约合五千万美元），威斯汀豪斯公司也投资一千三百五十万美元。这两项投资都附有苛刻的条件。其中“美援”投资的年股息高达6％，台湾电力公司每年单是缴纳“美援”投资的股息就要三百万美元。至于美国威斯汀豪斯公司投资的股息更高。
    美国垄断资本还攫取了台湾电力公司的主要人事任免权。台湾电力公司采购和增添设备，也要得到美方的同意，并且指定要向美国那一家公司购买。
    台湾电力公司是管辖全台湾电力工业的企业，拥有发电所三十五间。为了控制台湾的经济命脉和谋取暴利，它几年来一直是美国对台湾进行经济侵略的重点。（附图片）
