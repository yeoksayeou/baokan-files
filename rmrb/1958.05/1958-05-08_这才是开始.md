    This is Just the Beginning
  　Liao Shigang
    Editor's Note: Liao Shigang is a young milling machine operator at the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. This year, he has broken his own leap forward plan seven times. He initially planned to complete the equivalent of five years' worth of work in four and a half months. By early April, he changed the sewing machine positioning lever from milling machine processing to punch press processing, increasing efficiency by 137 times, and completed the equivalent of five years' worth of work in eleven and a half days. A few days later, he changed a type of part from manual operation to machine processing, increasing production by 1,680 times. Recently, Liao Shigang has proposed a new leap forward plan: to achieve more than 20 improvements, ensure an 8,000-fold increase in production efficiency, and strive to reach 10,000 times. On April 23rd, a comrade named Tian Yu wrote a poem to congratulate Liao Shigang on his achievements. Below is Liao Shigang's reply to Tian Yu's poem. (He only attended elementary school for a few years, and was a farmer in 1953.) We have never met, but perhaps we have seen each other in the crowd. I am an ordinary young worker, and here I express my warm gratitude to you. The Party is my own mother, the Party personally educated and nurtured me to grow. Now the Party has proposed to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, like putting a thousand-jin burden on one's own shoulders. There is nothing else, it is the Party's call that encourages me to move forward! The journey of five years can be completed in just a few hours. You are right, this is definitely not the final number. To tell the truth: this is not worth being surprised about, it is the Party's teaching that has made me clear for whom I am working. Please do not praise me excessively, the journey of ten thousand miles has only just begun. Before liberation, who would have looked up to this poor boy like me? Others called me a fool, and I was bullied everywhere; after liberation, I have only made a little insignificant achievement, and I have received such cherishment from the Party and the people. We have never met, but a common ideal binds our hearts closely together. You were a soldier yesterday, and today you are a poet; I was a farmer in the past, and today I am a worker. Let us move forward hand in hand! Bring out our wisdom and energy, leap forward, leap forward, and leap forward again! Make the high mountains bow their heads, make the rivers give way, and throw that old-brand British imperialism far behind our country. (Attached picture)

    这才是开始
  　廖世刚
    编者按：廖世刚是重庆建设机床厂的青年铣工，今年他已经七次突破自己订的跃进计划。他开始预订四个半月完成相当于五年的工作量。到4月初，他把缝纫机定位杆由铣床加工改为冲床加工，提高工效一百三十七倍，以十一天半的时间完成了相当于五年的工作量。过了几天，他又把一种零件由人工操作改为机器加工，使产量提高了一千六百八十倍。最近廖世刚又提出了新的跃进计划：实现二十多项改进，保证提高生产效率八千倍，争取达到一万倍。4月23日，一位作者田羽同志写诗祝贺廖世刚的成就，下面是廖世刚复田羽的诗。（他只上过几年小学，1953年还是个农民。）我们从来不相识，但也许在人群中见过面。我是个普通的青年工人，在这里我向你表示热烈的感谢。党就是我亲生的母亲，党亲手教育培养我成长。现在党提出十五年赶上英国，好比把千斤担儿放在自己的肩上。没有别的，是党的号召鼓舞着我前进！五年的路程只要几个钟头就能走完，你说得对，这决不是最后的数字。说真话：这并不值得惊异，是党的教导使我明确了为谁劳动，请你不要对我过分的夸奖，万里行程现在才跨出了第一步。解放前我这穷小子有谁瞧得起？别人叫我傻瓜，到处受欺；解放后只作出一点微末的成绩，就受到党和人民这样的珍视。我们从来不相识，但共同的理想把我们的心紧紧联结在一起，你昨天是战士，今天是诗人；我过去是农民，今天是工人，让我们携手前进！拿出我们的智慧和干劲，跃进，跃进，再跃进！叫高山低头，叫河水让路，把那老牌英帝国主义，远远地抛在我们国家的背后。（附图片）
