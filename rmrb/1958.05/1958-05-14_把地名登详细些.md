    Include More Detailed Place Names
    When the People's Daily publishes things, it often has the problem of not clearly stating place names. For example, in the article "Tuanjie (Unity) Courtyard is More United" published on the second page on May 1st, the address "No. 3 courtyard in Cotton Alley, Xia Si Tiao, Qiujia Street, Qianmen District" is not completely clear. Which place is Qianmen District? Only readers in Beijing know this; readers elsewhere may not. If residents from other places or those working in neighborhood committees want to visit and learn from this "Tuanjie Courtyard," they would have to inquire with the People's Daily, which would bring a lot of trouble and inconvenience! The People's Daily is not a local newspaper; I hope you will pay serious attention to this issue in the future.

    把地名登详细些
    人民日报刊登一些东西，时有不说清地名的毛病。比如5月1日第二版登的一篇“团结院更加团结”的文章，地址是“前门区裘家街棉花下四条三号院”这个就不完全清楚。哪地方的前门区？这个除了北京读者知道，别的地方的读者就不一定知道了。如果外地的居民或做街道工作的人们要想访问学习一下这个“团结院”，那就只得向人民日报查询了，这会带来许多麻烦和不便！人民日报不是地方报纸，希望今后能认真注意这个问题。
