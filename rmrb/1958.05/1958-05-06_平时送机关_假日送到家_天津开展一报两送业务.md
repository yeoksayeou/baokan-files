Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 4th: Today is the first Sunday in May. Early in the morning, many workers and cadres in Tianjin received newspapers delivered to their homes by postmen, which are usually sent to their institutions and enterprises. This is the convenience brought to readers by the "one newspaper, two deliveries" service launched by the Tianjin Post Office and Newspaper Distribution Bureau.

In the past, readers could only have one delivery address for a newspaper subscription. If it was delivered to an institution or enterprise, they couldn't see it at home on Sundays. In recent years, Tianjin has offered a "Sunday subscription" service for newspapers, which was convenient, but many subscriptions were duplicated, which was a waste of national and individual resources. Now, if readers subscribe to a newspaper at their institution or enterprise, they only need to write their dormitory address on the order form, and the newspaper will be delivered directly to their home on Sundays.

The "one newspaper, two deliveries" service, launched comprehensively in Tianjin, a large city with millions of people, is a bold initiative. During the rectification campaign and the Great Leap Forward in Production, based on readers' opinions, the staff of the Newspaper Distribution Bureau, with revolutionary spirit, broke with conventions and put forward this proposal, which was immediately valued and adopted by the leadership. After the launch of the "one newspaper, two deliveries" service, the workload of the Tianjin Newspaper Distribution Bureau increased by more than double, and the number of deliveries by the relevant post office delivery personnel increased by more than six times. However, due to the overall adjustment of the labor organization and the high enthusiasm of the staff, not a single business person or delivery person was added.

### 平时送机关  假日送到家  天津开展一报两送业务

    平时送机关  假日送到家
    天津开展一报两送业务
    新华社天津4日电　今天是5月份的第一个星期日，一清早，天津市许多工人、干部就接到邮递员把平常送往机关、企业里的报纸送到家里来。这是天津市邮局和报刊发行局开办的“一报两送”业务给读者带来的方便。
    过去，读者订阅一份报纸，投递地点只能是一个，如果是送到机关、企业里去，星期天在家就看不到。近年来，天津市曾开办过报纸“星期订户”，方便是方便了，但许多是重复订阅，对国家对个人财力物力上都是个浪费。现在读者在机关、企业里订一份报纸，只要在订单上写上宿舍的地址，星期天就会直接给他把报送到家里去。
    “一报两送”的业务，在天津市这样几百万人口的大城市一下子就全面开展，是一个大胆的创举。在整风运动和生产大跃进中，报刊发行局的职工根据读者的意见，以革命的精神，打破陈规，提出这一建议，立刻受到领导的重视和采纳。开办“一报两送”的业务以后，天津市报刊发行局有关工作量增加了一倍多，邮局有关投递员的投递次数增加六倍多，但由于全面调整了劳动组织和职工的热情高涨，一个业务员和投递员也没增加。
