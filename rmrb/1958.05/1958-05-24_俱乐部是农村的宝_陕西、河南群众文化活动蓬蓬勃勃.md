Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an: The more than 21,000 rural clubs in Shaanxi Province regularly organize members to read newspapers, sing, perform plays, learn to read, and learn technology, which are loved by the vast number of members.

In the past two months, more than 5,500 new clubs have been established in Shaanxi Province. Together with the original clubs, two-thirds of the agricultural cooperatives in the province now have clubs. More than ten counties, including Xianyang and Huayin, have achieved clubs in every cooperative. These rural clubs combine activities with the central tasks of the current Great Leap Forward in various periods, which not only enriches the cultural and spiritual life of the members, but also plays a major role in promoting production. The club of the Dengta No. 1 Cooperative in Dali County proposed: "Where there is labor, there is entertainment." In April of this year, during the canal and dam construction, they brought huqins, suonas, gongs, drums, and radios to the construction site and performed during rest periods. The Hechi Cooperative Club in Chang'an County held six or seven lectures and storytelling sessions in succession. In five days, the "Twenty Struggle Targets for Changing the Face of the Province in Three Years of Hard Work" proposed by the Provincial Party Committee was publicized to every household. While producing, the members happily sang self-composed rhymes: "Twenty articles, bright as a lamp, shine brightly in our hearts. Follow the twenty articles and move forward, and we are full of energy." The Xinghuo Agricultural Cooperative Club in Yan'an County has recently compiled and printed a small newspaper, which regularly introduces various small messages about science and hygiene, which is very popular among the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou: More than 50,000 agricultural cooperatives in Henan Province have basically met the requirement of having a club in every cooperative. Most of these clubs were established during the Great Leap Forward and have become a propaganda and mobilization force in the Great Leap Forward.

The earlier clubs have cultivated their own playwrights, directors, actors, singers, and instrumental accompanists. Clubs that publish small newspapers have also cultivated their own news reporters. In counties with particularly active cultural life, such as Linxian, Yuxian, and Xingyang, cultural and recreational activities have broad mass participation.

The activities of these clubs are diverse, and the characteristics of the activities are: whatever is produced, that is what is sung, performed, and written; wherever production is, cultural activities follow. During the Great Leap Forward, tens of thousands of water conservancy construction sites across the province were the most concentrated and active places for cultural and recreational activities. There were hero lists, mobilization platforms, mobile library groups, and living newspaper plays on the construction sites. The people of Yuxian governed 913 mountains in three months, and the county's clubs carried out activities on more than 900 mountain tops. They published blackboard newspapers on the rocks, and there were mobilization platforms on the mountains. The clubs mobilized the masses to create 300,000 quick verses and poems, which were compiled and printed to mobilize the heroes of mountain management.

    俱乐部是农村的宝
    陕西、河南群众文化活动蓬蓬勃勃
    据新华社西安讯　陕西省两万一千多个农村俱乐部经常组织社员们读报、唱歌、演戏、识字、学技术，受到广大社员的喜爱。
    陕西省最近两个月来新建立俱乐部五千五百多个，加上原有的俱乐部，全省三分之二的农业社都有了俱乐部。咸阳、华阴等十多县都达到了社社有俱乐部。这些农村俱乐部结合当前生产大跃进各个时期的中心工作进行活动，不仅丰富了社员们的文化精神生活，而且对于推动生产也起了重大作用。大荔县灯塔一社的俱乐部提出：“哪里有劳动，哪里有娱乐”，今年4月修渠坝中，他们把胡琴、唢呐、锣鼓和收音机等带到工地，趁休息时间进行演唱。长安县河池社俱乐部接连举办了六、七次讲演会、故事会，五天时间就把省委提出的“苦战三年，改变全省面貌二十条奋斗指标”宣传到家喻户晓，社员们一边生产，一边高兴地唱着自编的顺口溜：“二十条，明如灯，照得心里亮晶晶，顺着二十条向前走，浑身上下都是劲”。延安县星火农业社俱乐部最近还编印了小报，经常介绍各种科学卫生等小消息，很受群众欢迎。
    据新华社郑州讯　河南省五万多个农业社，基本上达到了社社都有俱乐部的要求。这些俱乐部多半是在大跃进中建立起来的，成为大跃进中的一支宣传鼓动力量。
    办的较早的俱乐部已经培养了自己的编剧、导演、演员、歌手和乐器伴奏者。出版有小报的俱乐部，还培养了自己的新闻记者。在林县、禹县、荥阳等文化生活特别活跃的县份，文娱活动具有广泛的群众性。
    这些俱乐部的活动方式是多种多样的，活动特点是：生产什么就唱什么、演什么、编写什么；生产在哪里，文化活动就跟到哪里。在大跃进中，全省几万个水利工地，是文化娱乐活动最集中最活跃的地方。工地上有英雄榜、鼓动台、流动图书组、活报剧等。禹县人民在三个月中治理了九百一十三座山，全县的俱乐部就在九百多个山顶上展开活动，在岩石上出黑板报，山上有鼓动台，俱乐部发动群众创作了三十万首快板诗歌，又把它编印起来去鼓动治山英雄。
