    Jinxi Builds Two Small Fertilizer Plants
    With the assistance of state-owned factories, Jinxi County, Liaoning Province, is building two small chemical fertilizer plants capable of producing more than 30,000 tons of nitrogen and phosphate fertilizer annually. The nitrogen fertilizer plant uses the large amount of waste ammonium sulfate mixed salts from the Jinxi Chemical Plant and waste ammonia water from the Petroleum Plant No. 5 as raw materials. The design work for the nitrogen fertilizer plant was done by engineers from the Jinxi Chemical Plant in their spare time for Jinxi County. The Jinxi Chemical Plant and Petroleum Plant No. 5 also transferred idle equipment and some scrapped equipment to the county and actively helped them repair and use them.

    锦西建设两个小化肥厂
    辽宁省锦西县在国营工厂协助下建设两个小型化学肥料厂，能年产氮肥、磷肥三万多吨。氮肥厂是利用锦西化工厂大量废弃的硫酸錏混合盐类和石油五厂的废氨水做原料的，氮肥厂的设计工作是锦西化工厂的工程师利用业余时间为锦西县设计的。锦西化工厂和石油五厂还把闲置的设备和一些报废的设备调给县里，还主动地帮助他们修理使用。（据新华社）
