    Learn Some Foreign Languages
    Jiang Chunfang
    Those who have been in contact with foreign friends deeply realize how convenient and useful it is to understand some foreign languages. Understanding this makes it easy to comprehend why so many foreign friends hope to learn Chinese and wish that Chinese characters could be made easier to learn.
    Most foreign languages are phonetic, making them not difficult to learn and easier than Chinese. Therefore, we should not be afraid of difficulty and refrain from learning. In fact, the problem lies not in difficulty but in whether we are determined to learn.
    Learning a foreign language is not just for translation; there is a significant distance between understanding a foreign language and being able to translate. Therefore, do not think that you should not learn a foreign language just because you do not plan to be a translator.
    Conversely, do not think that since there are translators anyway, you do not need to learn a foreign language. Those who have been abroad or have been in contact with foreign friends know that if you do not understand a foreign language, you will be helpless without a translator. Moreover, even if the translator is by your side at all times, you cannot freely express yourself. We originally have things to talk about with foreign friends, but because of the language barrier, or to avoid troubling the translator, we often retreat in the face of difficulty. Foreign friends also often shrug, wave their hands, and smile regretfully for the same reason, even though they have something to say to us.
    In foreign countries, people from different countries interact frequently. They generally understand one or more foreign languages. Once they find a common language, they talk very closely. It is worth noting that for most foreign comrades, so-called understanding of a foreign language only means being able to speak a common language, sometimes mixed with many grammatical errors. However, they rely on this not-so-proficient common language to solve many problems. This shows that for the sake of convenient interaction and mutual understanding, language is important not in its refinement but in its accessibility (refinement is the translator's task). Therefore, we do not need to be intimidated by foreign languages, afraid to inquire, nor do we need to insist on perfection before speaking.
    Among people who do not understand each other's languages, even if someone only knows a few words of a foreign language, they can immediately play a significant role. When everyone is "stuck" and unable to communicate, even if it's just a little foreign language we learned in childhood and have long forgotten, a few words can be squeezed out to be of great use. In this case, although not seeking thorough understanding, everyone is delighted when communication is established. At this time, you will deeply believe that learning a little foreign language is indeed very useful.
    Our current foreign language teaching policy is entirely correct: massively train foreign language teachers, universally teach foreign languages, so that our new generation can all have a basic understanding of one or more foreign languages; improve on the basis of popularization, and cultivate a group of people who are proficient in foreign languages. The aforementioned ability of foreigners to generally find a "common language" to communicate, although not proficient, but basically able to understand, is precisely because these countries can implement the policy of universally learning a foreign language.
    In today's situation where our international relations are becoming increasingly close and frequent, the need for foreign languages is becoming increasingly urgent. Our cadres, no matter what work they do, need to learn some foreign languages. The future development of the international situation requires us all to understand some foreign languages even more.
    Illiterate people are called illiterates. People who do not understand foreign languages, in today's arena of international exchanges, are not only illiterate but also deaf and mute. Living in an era of frequent international activities, having eyes but not knowing how to read foreign languages, having ears but not knowing how to listen to foreign languages, and having a mouth but not knowing how to speak foreign languages is not just a personal problem.
    Learning a little foreign language is not only for the convenience of interacting with foreign friends, but more importantly, foreign languages can be used as a means, a tool, to enable us to read foreign books and newspapers, expand our horizons, and enrich our knowledge. When we want to advance towards science and master all the latest knowledge and technology in the world, when we want to catch up with and surpass Britain in a short period of time, understanding only one's own national language is too little, and the world of knowledge we can explore is too narrow.
    In learning foreign languages, Marx, Engels, and Lenin are excellent examples for us. They were all proficient in several major foreign languages and had a basic understanding of several minor ones. Marx and Engels even wrote books in foreign languages. Some of their important works were not written in their native language (German) but directly in English or French. Lenin could deliver reports in German at the Comintern Congress. They often learned those foreign languages in order to read the original texts of certain foreign works. Precisely because they were proficient in many languages, they were able to read and study many foreign works through these languages and wrote immortal masterpieces like "Capital," "Dialectics of Nature," and "Imperialism," which required mastering countless foreign materials.
    Engels had a particularly developed language talent. According to the French newspaper "Le Figaro" in 1871, Engels "could stammer in twenty languages." The term "stammer" here does not mean that Engels had not mastered twenty languages. He actually was proficient in at least a dozen languages. It refers to the fact that he originally had a slight stutter, but even with a stutter, he could stammer in twenty languages. This is a great inspiration for us: any unfavorable conditions cannot prevent us from learning foreign languages, and after mastering one foreign language, we should learn a second, a third... foreign language.
    Do not think that you are too old and your tongue is not flexible enough, so you no longer want to "bother" to learn a foreign language. Learning a foreign language, like an illiterate person learning to read, is never too late. Marx started learning Russian when he was over sixty, which is a great encouragement for us.
    Not for the sake of becoming a linguist, nor for the sake of becoming a professional translator, but merely for the needs of life and the needs of work, we should learn a little foreign language.

    学点外国文
    姜椿芳
    接触过外国朋友的人，都深深地体会到，能懂点外国文是多么方便，多么有用处。明白这一点就不难理解许多外国朋友为什么这样希望学习中国语文，这样希望中国文字改得容易学些。
    一般外国语文都是拼音化的，学起来并不困难，都比中国语文容易学。所以我们首先不要怕难而不学。其实问题不在于难易，而在于是否下决心去学。
    学外国文不就是为了做翻译，懂外文与翻译之间，还有很大一个距离。因此，不要以为自己不预备当翻译就不学外文。
    反过来说，也不要以为反正有翻译，自己用不着学外文。出过国或是接触过外国朋友的人都知道，如果自己不懂外文，一离翻译就寸步难行，而且，即使翻译在身边寸步不离，自己也不能畅所欲言。我们本来有话要找外国朋友谈谈，因为言语不通，或者为了免得麻烦翻译，往往知难而退。外国朋友对我们也往往由于同样的原因，虽然有话要说，也只得耸耸肩、摆摆手，遗憾地一笑而去。
    在国外，不同国家的人，时相往来，他们一般都通晓一种以上外文，一找到共同语言，他们便谈得十分亲密。可注意的是，一般外国同志，所谓通外文，也只是能讲讲普通话，有时也夹杂着不少文法上的错误，但是他们就是依靠这种不够纯熟的共同语言，解决了许多问题。这说明，为了交往方便，为了互相了解，语言不在精而在通（精通是翻译的任务），因此，我们也大可不必对于外文望而生畏，不敢问津，也不必非精不谈，慑于开口。
    在互相不通语言的人们中，那怕有谁只懂得外文的几个字，立时就能发挥极大作用。在大家“憋住”无法交谈的时候，那怕只是我们小时候学过一点外文，现在早已忘记，也会被憋出几个字来大派用场。在这种情况下，虽然不求甚解，但是一言既通，皆大欢喜，这时候，你会深深地相信，学一点外文，确实有很大用处。
    现在我国的外文教学方针是完全正确的：大量培养外文师资，普遍教授外文，让我们新的一代都能粗通一种以上外文；在普及的基础上提高，养成一批精通外文的人材。前面所说外国人一般都能找到“普通话”来交谈，虽非精通，但能粗通，能通就好，正就是这些国家能贯彻普遍学一种外文方针的缘故。
    在我们今天国际往来关系日益密切和频繁的情形下，外文的需要日益迫切，我们的干部，无论做什么工作，都有必要学点外文。今后国际形势的发展，更要求我们大家都懂点外文。
    不识字的人称为文盲，不懂外文的人，在今天国际往来场中，就不仅是文盲，而且是文聋、文哑。生在国际活动频繁的时代，有眼不会看外文，有耳不会听外文，有嘴不会说外文，那就不仅仅是个人苦恼的问题了。
    学点外文还不仅是为了便于和外国朋友往来，更重要的是外文可以作为一种手段，一种工具，使我们有可能阅读外国书报，扩大我们的眼界，丰富我们的知识。当我们要向科学进军，掌握世界一切最新知识和技术的时候，当我们要在短期间赶上和赶过英国的时候，单懂一种本国文太嫌不够了，我们能够涉猎的知识世界太狭小了。
    在学习外文方面，马克思、恩格斯、列宁是我们极好的榜样。他们都精通几种主要的外文，另外还粗通几种次要的。马克思和恩格斯甚至能用外文著书，他们的若干重要著作，不是用本国文（德文），而是直接用英文或法文写的。列宁能在共产国际大会上用德文做报告。他们往往为了阅读某些外国著作的原文，就去学习那些外文。正因为他们通晓许多种文字，他们能通过这些文字阅读和研究许多外国的论著，写出了像“资本论”、“自然辩证法”、“帝国主义论”这样必须掌握无数外国材料的不朽巨著。
    恩格斯的语言天才特别发达，据法国“费加罗报”1871年载，恩格斯“能结结巴巴地说二十种语言”。这里所说的结结巴巴并不是指恩格斯没有掌握二十种语言，他实际上至少精通十几种语言，这里是指他本来有些口吃，可是即使有些口吃，也能结结巴巴地说二十种语言。这对于我们是很大的启发：任何不利的条件，不能阻止我们学习外文，而且掌握一种外文后，还应该学第二种、第三种……外文。
    不要以为自己老了，舌头不灵活了，就想不再“费劲”去学外文。学习外文，也像文盲学识字一样，是永久不会嫌晚的，马克思六十多岁的时候还开始学习俄文，这个例子对于我们是很大的鼓励。
    不是为了做语言学家，也不是为了做专业的翻译家，仅仅为了生活上的需要，工作上的需要，就应该学习一点外国文。
