　　Criticism Response

　　The letter "The Light Bulbs from Shenyang Light Bulb Factory are No Good," written by Comrade Gao Rui and published in the People's Daily on April 28th, was inspected by our factory and found to be a correct criticism. Recently, our factory has received many opinions from various places, all criticizing the low quality of our products and the fact that the light bulb filaments easily break. In order to accept the criticisms from the broad masses of users and improve product quality, our factory has now made the quality issue the main focus of rectification, carrying out thorough improvements in all aspects, including technology, equipment, and materials, striving to bring the quality of our factory's products up to advanced levels in the shortest possible time.

　　一定迅速提高灯泡质量
    4月28日人民日报刊载高瑞同志写的“沈阳灯泡厂的灯泡不好”的来信，经我厂检查认为，这个批评是正确的。最近我厂收到来自各地的很多意见，一致批评我厂产品质量不高，灯泡钨丝易断。为了接受广大用户批评，提高产品质量，现在我厂已将质量问题作为整改的主要内容，从工艺、设备、材料等各方面进行彻底改进，力争在最短时间内，使我厂产品质量赶上先进水平。
