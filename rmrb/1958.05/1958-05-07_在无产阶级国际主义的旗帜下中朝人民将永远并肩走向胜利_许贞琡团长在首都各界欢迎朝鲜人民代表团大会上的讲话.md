Respected Comrade Guo Moruo: Dear Comrades and Friends!

Today, representatives of the people from all walks of life in the capital city of Beijing of the fraternal People's Republic of China are giving us such a warm welcome. The Korean People's Delegation extends to you its heartfelt gratitude.

I would like to take this opportunity to convey to you, and through you, to all the Chinese people, the most sincere and friendly greetings of the Korean people.

The glorious achievements of the Chinese People's Volunteers in the struggle against the common enemy will be immortal.

During the most difficult period of the Korean people's great Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs, the Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee) gang, the fraternal Chinese people held high the banner of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, actively supported our struggle, and directly dispatched the Chinese People's Volunteers, composed of their own outstanding sons and daughters, to our country, aiding the Korean people with their blood.

The Chinese People's Volunteer soldiers, educated by the glorious Chinese Communist Party, fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean people, who had risen up in unison to defend the independence of their fatherland and the fruits of the revolution from U.S. imperialist aggression, and established immortal feats of arms.

The Chinese People's Volunteers have always faithfully implemented the instructions of the Chinese Communist Party and Comrade Mao Zedong to "cherish every mountain, every river, every blade of grass, and every tree in Korea."

The people of both China and Korea still clearly remember, and will never forget, many battles such as the fierce and cruel Battle of Shangganling; on every battlefield that has undergone fierce fighting, the lofty moral qualities possessed by thousands of Chinese People's Volunteer officers and soldiers who bravely fought, sacrificing their precious youth like the hero Yang Gensi, and warriors like Luo Shengjiao, who sacrificed themselves to save the life of a Korean boy, have become living examples of proletarian internationalist friendship and solidarity.

During the fierce war, the Chinese People's Volunteers also vigorously helped Korean farmers build rivers and water conservancy projects, cultivated fields, hoed weeds, harvested autumn crops, threshed grain, and even saved military rations to help the Korean people.

The glorious achievements established by the Chinese People's Volunteers in the cruel struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism, are indescribable.

This deep love and support for the Korean people is only possible under such a relationship: the traditional friendship and solidarity between the people of China and Korea, closely linked together by the internationalist ideology of Marxism-Leninism and forged in the long-term common struggle against imperialist foreign aggressors.

The Korean people will never forget the noble internationalist spirit of the Chinese people in raising and nurturing Korean war orphans into outstanding talents.

The Chinese people rescued many war orphans, who had lost their homes and parents due to the barbarous atrocities of U.S. imperialism, from the cruel scourge of war, and protected and nurtured them with love like their own flesh and blood.

When the cruel Korean War was still going on, the Korean war orphans who were embraced by the warm embrace of the Chinese people were still ignorant children who could not even walk. Not only that, their bodies were also abnormally weak due to war and disease.

Anyone who has raised children can imagine how difficult it is to restore so many children to health, take care of their sleeping and eating, and educate them.

However, the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people cared for them like their own flesh and blood, worried that they would get sick, worried that they would be cold, worried that they would be inconvenienced, provided all medical assistance to restore them to health, and provided good food, clothing, and housing conditions, nurturing them for six years as if they were their own children, enabling them to master advanced science and technology, and doing their utmost to train them into reliable, healthy talents for building Korea.

Korean war orphans have learned advanced science and technology in your country and have been educated to be loyal to their motherland and people. Several thousand of them have returned to their country, and they are satisfactorily using all their enthusiasm and talents in various positions in the construction of their socialist motherland.

Comrade Han Guangrong, who was nurtured and cultivated in Beizhen Primary School in Liaoning Province and has become a model worker in the Pyongyang Textile Factory after returning to his country, wrote in his memoirs: "Due to the barbarous atrocities of U.S. imperialism, I lost my father and mother. I grew up in the warm embrace of the Chinese people who rescued me from the sea of fire. The Chinese people are just like my own parents and siblings. I especially cannot forget the Chinese old man who worked in our academy. Although he had a wife and lovely children in the countryside, he volunteered to work in our academy day and night to take care of us and loved us like his own flesh and blood. I called him Dad, and he called me Daughter. Although we haven't met again since we separated, our feelings are evergreen along with the friendship of the two peoples."

This sentiment is the sentiment of all the children of patriotic martyrs and war orphans who grew up in the embrace of the Chinese people, and it is also the unanimous sentiment of the Chinese people who nurtured our war orphans.

The Korean orphans who have grown up happily in your warm embrace will soon return to their motherland to work, and they will become the core force for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and the construction of socialism.

There is a saying in Korea: "The grace of nurturing is greater than the grace of giving birth." The Korean people will never forget the noble proletarian internationalist thinking and flesh-and-blood love displayed by the Chinese people in nurturing and cultivating ignorant children into outstanding talents, as well as the fraternal friendship, and will pass these on like legends from generation to generation. To this end, the Korean People's Delegation conveys the highest respect and deepest heartfelt gratitude of the Korean Workers' Party, the government of the Republic, and the Korean people to the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, who have consistently given fraternal assistance and support to the Korean people in terms of material and spirit.

The Korean people are not isolated at any time. Thanks to the assistance of fraternal countries, the Korean people have made great achievements in the cause of building their motherland.

Dear Comrades and Friends!

The friendship and solidarity between our two peoples is being further consolidated and developed on the road of revolutionary struggle and socialist construction of our two peoples.

Not long ago, the visit to China by the delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, headed by Premier Kim Il-sung, and the visit to Korea by the government delegation of the People's Republic of China, headed by Premier Zhou Enlai, made great contributions to further strengthening and developing the traditional friendly relations between the people of China and Korea.

The friendly relations between our two peoples, who are closely united in fraternal friendship and mutual assistance, are deepening and developing day by day. Under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the great Chinese people have made great achievements in the socialist construction of their own country.

The entire working people of China have brought into play a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creative spirit, victoriously completed the First Five-Year Plan, and have begun to implement the Second Five-Year Plan, which marks a new and great process of socialist construction, this year. As a result, a great leap forward has begun in all fields of industry, agriculture, science, and culture, further consolidating and developing the cause of socialist construction.

Today, the international status and prestige of the People's Republic of China have been raised to an unprecedented level, and it has become an important force in the development of the international situation, especially the changes in the Asian situation.

The Korean people are as happy about all the achievements made by the Chinese people as they are about their own achievements, and they are learning from them.

After three years of cruel war, the cities and villages of Korea were turned into ruins, and the Korean people carried out post-war reconstruction work under such extremely difficult conditions.

The Korean people have not been isolated at any time. During the period of post-war economic recovery and construction and socialist construction, the Korean people have been fighting with the material and spiritual assistance of the people of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other fraternal countries, and with the absolute support of peace-loving people all over the world.

The Chinese people supported the struggle of the Korean people and provided 8 billion yuan in aid, which infinitely inspired the Korean people who rose up to fight for post-war economic recovery and socialist construction.

The Korean people, crushing all the plots of enemies at home and abroad to undermine the precious socialist achievements and disintegrate our unity and solidarity, are more united than ever around the Korean Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kim Il-sung, following the correct economic policy of the Korean Workers' Party of giving priority to the development of heavy industry and at the same time developing light industry and agriculture, bringing into play a high degree of patriotism and selfless spirit, and are making great labor achievements.

In this way, we have restored and developed our people's economy at a rapid pace, victoriously completed the Three-Year People's Economic Plan after the war, and are effectively implementing the second year - 1958 - plan of the First Five-Year Plan.

At the end of 1957, the total industrial output value of our country increased to 2.8 times that of 1949, and the total grain output also exceeded the output of 1956, the year with the highest grain output in our country, by 11.4%.

At the same time, 95.6% of the total number of peasant households in our country have joined agricultural production cooperatives, and the socialist transformation of the rural economy has been basically completed.

The average wages of workers and staff have also increased significantly, and the material and cultural living standards of the people have been rapidly improved.

However, the situation of the people in the southern half of our country today is completely different from that in the northern half. The southern half of the Republic, under the occupation of U.S. imperialism and the traitorous rule of Li Chengwan (Syngman Rhee), has become a veritable living hell.

The beautiful rivers and mountains and all the resources of the southern half of the Republic are still suffering from the ravages and plunder of the U.S. aggressors; the barbarous atrocities committed by the U.S. bandits against our brothers and sisters in broad daylight continue to occur everywhere.

National industry and rural economy have also been cruelly destroyed. In cities and villages, there are countless unemployed people and starving peasants, and children begging for food are wandering in groups everywhere.

The root cause of all these miserable scenes and misfortunes lies entirely in the occupation of the southern half of the Republic by the U.S. invading army, who are irreconcilable enemies of the Korean people.

The Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Republic have repeatedly put forward reasonable proposals for the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued another statement on February 5 this year.

The government of the People's Republic of China, which has consistently made efforts for the consolidation of world peace and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, has expressed its full support for the statement of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea; the Chinese People's Volunteers have also taken the initiative to withdraw all of their forces from Korea by the end of 1958.

This proactive measure by the people of China and Korea once again clearly confirms the peace-loving policy of our two peoples.

However, U.S. imperialism still not only fails to take any measures regarding the proposals of the governments of China and Korea for the peaceful reunification of Korea, but continues to expand its armaments in the southern half of the Republic, conduct atomic war exercises, violently trample on the armistice agreement, and carry out a series of provocative actions on the military demarcation line.

In this way, the wolf in sheep's clothing - U.S. imperialism - has once again nakedly exposed its ugly nature in front of the people of the world.

Today, the U.S. aggressors have no excuse to continue to stay in the southern half of the Republic, let alone any excuse to rationalize their colonial military occupation.

Only when the U.S. invading troops withdraw from the southern half of the Republic can the peaceful reunification of our motherland be realized.

U.S. imperialism not only occupies the southern half of our country, but also occupies a part of Chinese territory - Taiwan - and is attempting to turn it into a base for atomic war.

Such a conspiracy by the enemy is bound to be smashed. Taiwan belongs to the Chinese people. The Chinese people will surely win.

Today, the era in which we live is an era of historical transformation in which peace prevails over war and capitalism tends towards overall decline worldwide.

No conspiracy of U.S. imperialism can stop the advance of the Chinese and Korean people who are fighting for the peaceful reunification, independence, and territorial integrity of their motherland.

With the support of the Soviet Union, China, the socialist camp, and peace-loving people all over the world, the Korean people will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland.

We, the Korean people, with the support of the great Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, friends of the fraternal socialist camp, and peace-loving people all over the world, will surely drive the U.S. imperialists out of our territory, will forever defend the socialist achievements obtained through creative labor struggles, and will surely achieve the peaceful reunification of our motherland.

The Korean people and the Chinese people will further consolidate and develop the traditional friendship and solidarity between the two peoples, and under the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, will forever march shoulder to shoulder towards victory.

In this world, there is no force that can destroy the strength of the solidarity between our two peoples, China and Korea. Victory belongs to us.

Finally, I would like to once again express my warm gratitude and greatest respect to the Chinese Communist Party, the government of the People's Republic of China, and the Chinese people, who have continuously supported and assisted the Korean people.

Long live the unbreakable friendship and solidarity between the people of China and Korea!

Long live the unity and solidarity of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union!

Long live lasting world peace!

Long live the glorious Chinese Communist Party!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people!

    在无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下中朝人民将永远并肩走向胜利
    许贞琡团长在首都各界欢迎朝鲜人民代表团大会上的讲话尊敬的郭沫若同志：亲爱的同志们，朋友们！
    今天，兄弟般的中华人民共和国首都北京市各界人民的代表这样热烈地欢迎我们，朝鲜人民代表团谨向你们表示衷心的谢意。
    我在这里向各位并通过各位向全体中国人民转达朝鲜人民最深切的友好的问候。
    在反对共同敌人的斗争中，中国人民志愿军建立的丰功伟绩将永垂不朽。
    在朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗李承晚匪帮的伟大的祖国解放战争最艰苦的时期，兄弟般的中国人民高举抗美援朝的旗帜，积极支援了我们的斗争，并且直接派遣由自己的优秀儿女组成的中国人民志愿军到我国，用鲜血援助了朝鲜人民。
    光荣的中国共产党教育下的中国人民志愿军勇士们，跟为了从美帝国主义的侵犯下保卫祖国的独立和革命果实而一致奋起斗争的朝鲜人民一道，并肩作战，建立了不朽的丰功伟绩。
    中国人民志愿军始终忠实地执行了中国共产党和毛泽东同志“要爱护朝鲜的一山一水一草一木”的指示。
    朝中两国人民还清楚地记得，并且永远不会忘记激烈残酷的上甘岭战斗等许多战斗；在每一个经过激战的战场上，像杨根思英雄那样献出自己宝贵的青春勇敢战斗的成千上万的中国人民志愿军官兵和为了拯救朝鲜少年的生命而牺牲的罗盛教那样的勇士们所具有的崇高的道德品质，业已成为无产阶级国际主义友好团结的活榜样。
    在激烈的战争期间，中国人民志愿军还大力帮助朝鲜农民兴修河川水利，耕田锄地，除草，秋收，打场，甚至节约出军粮来帮助了朝鲜人民。
    在反对共同的敌人美帝国主义的残酷斗争中，中国人民志愿军建立的丰功伟绩，是无法形容的。
    对朝鲜人民的这种深厚的热爱和支援，只有在这种关系下才有可能，即：用马克思列宁主义的国际主义思想紧紧联结在一起并且在反对帝国主义外来侵略者的长期的共同斗争中结成的朝中两国人民的传统的友好团结关系。
    中国人民把朝鲜的战灾孤儿抚育培养成优秀人才，这种崇高的国际主义精神，朝鲜人民永远不能忘记。
    中国人民把由于美帝国主义的野蛮暴行而失去了家园和父母亲戚的许多战灾孤儿，从残酷的战争祸患中拯救出来，以亲骨肉般的爱，保护和抚育了他们。
    当残酷的朝鲜战争还在进行的时候，投入到中国人民温暖的怀抱里的朝鲜战灾孤儿，还都是连路都不会走的不懂事的孩子。不仅这样，他们的身体也都因为战争和疾病而异常衰弱。
    凡是抚育过孩子的人，都会想像得到，使这样多的孩子恢复健康，一一照顾他们的寝息和饮食，并且进行教育，是多么困难的事。
    但是，中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，亲骨肉似的关心他们，担心他们病倒，担心他们寒冷，担心他们不方便，提供了一切医疗上的帮助，使他们恢复了健康，并且提供了良好的衣食住条件，六年如一日地以无限诚挚的爱抚育了他们，使他们掌握了先进科学和技术，并且为了把他们培养成为建设朝鲜的身心健全的可靠人才，竭尽了全部力量。
    朝鲜的战灾孤儿，在你们的国家里学习了先进科学技术，受到了忠实于祖国和人民的教育，他们之中有几千人已经回国，他们正在建设社会主义祖国的各个岗位上令人满意地发挥着自己的一切热情和才能。
    曾经在辽宁省北镇初等学院受过抚育和培养、归国以后在平壤纺织厂已成为模范工作者的韩光容同志，在自己的回忆中写道：“由于美帝国主义的野蛮暴行，我失去了父亲和母亲。我是在把我从火海中拯救出来的中国人民的温暖怀抱里长大的。中国人民，简直同我的亲生父母和亲兄弟毫无两样。我尤其不能忘记在我们学院工作的中国老爷爷。他虽然有夫人和可爱的孩子在乡下，但是却志愿到我们学院夜以继日地照顾我们，像亲骨肉似地爱护我们。我叫他爸爸，他喊我女儿。我们分别后虽然没有再见面，但是我们的感情是同两国人民的友谊一道万古长青的。”
    这种心情，就是在中国人民的怀抱中成长起来的，所有爱国烈士子女和战灾孤儿的心情，也是抚育我国战灾孤儿的中国人民的一致的情感。
    在你们温暖的怀抱中幸福地成长起来的朝鲜孤儿们，不久以后，将要回到祖国去工作，他们将成为和平统一祖国和建设社会主义的核心力量。
    朝鲜有一句俗语：“养育之情胜过生育之情”。朝鲜人民永远不会忘记中国人民在把不懂事的孩子抚育和培养成为优秀人才方面所表现的崇高的无产阶级国际主义思想和骨肉般的爱，以及兄弟般的友谊，并且会把这些像传说似地一代代地流传下去。为此，朝鲜人民代表团特转达朝鲜劳动党、共和国政府和朝鲜人民对经常不惜在物质和精神方面给予朝鲜人民以兄弟般的援助和支援的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民的最崇高的敬意和深切的由衷谢意。
    朝鲜人民在任何时候不是孤立的，由于得到兄弟国家的援助，朝鲜人民已经在建设祖国的事业中取得巨大成绩。
    亲爱的同志们！朋友们！
    我们两国人民的友谊和团结，在我们两国人民的革命斗争和社会主义建设道路上，正进一步得到巩固和发展。
    不久以前，以金日成首相为首的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国代表团的访问中国和以周恩来总理为团长的中华人民共和国政府代表团的访问朝鲜，在进一步加强和发展朝中两国人民的传统友谊关系方面，作出了巨大的贡献。
    以兄弟般的友谊和互相帮助而紧密团结在一起的我们两国人民的友好关系，正在日益加深和发展。伟大的中国人民在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下，在自己祖国的社会主义建设道路上，取得了巨大的成就。
    中国全体劳动人民发挥高度的劳动热情和创造精神，胜利地完成了第一个五年计划，并且从今年开始执行标志着社会主义建设的新的巨大进程的第二个五年计划。因此，在工业、农业、科学和文化等一切领域里开始了大跃进，进一步巩固和发展了社会主义建设事业。
    今天，中华人民共和国的国际地位和威望已经空前提高，它已经成为国际形势的发展特别是亚洲形势的变化的重要力量。
    对于中国人民取得的这一切成就，朝鲜人民像对待自己的成就一样感到高兴，并且正在学习着它。
    经过三年来的残酷战争，朝鲜的城市和农村都变成了废墟，朝鲜人民就是在这样极其困难的情况下进行战后恢复建设工作的。
    朝鲜人民在任何时候都不是孤立的。在战后人民经济恢复建设时期和社会主义建设中，朝鲜人民都是在苏联、中华人民共和国以及其它兄弟国家人民的物质和精神的援助下，在全世界爱好和平人民的绝对支持下进行斗争的。
    中国人民支持朝鲜人民的斗争，给予了八万亿元的援助，进而无限地鼓舞了为战后人民经济的恢复建设和社会主义建设而奋起斗争的朝鲜人民。
    朝鲜人民，粉碎了国内外的一切敌人企图破坏宝贵的社会主义成就和瓦解我们的统一团结的阴谋，他们空前坚强地团结在以金日成同志为首的朝鲜劳动党的周围，遵循着朝鲜劳动党关于优先发展重工业并同时发展轻工业和农业的正确的经济政策，发挥高度的爱国主义忘我精神，正在取得着巨大的劳动成就。
    这样，我们以飞快的速度恢复和发展了我国的人民经济，胜利地完成了战后三年人民经济计划，并且正在有效地执行着第一个五年计划的第二年——1958年度的计划任务。
    在1957年年底，我国的工业总产值增长到了1949年的二点八倍，谷物总产量也超过了在我国谷物产量最高的年度1956年产量的11.4％。
    同时，我国的全国总农户中已经有95.6％加入农业生产合作社，基本上完成了农村经济的社会主义改造。
    工人和职员的平均工资也有了显著的增加，人民的物质文化生活水平得到了迅速的提高。
    然而，今天我国南半部人民的处境是跟北半部截然不同的。在美帝国主义强占下和李承晚卖国统治下的共和国南半部，变成了名副其实的人间活地狱。
    共和国南半部的美好河山和一切资源，仍在遭受着美国侵略者的蹂躏和掠夺；美国强盗们在大白天对我们的兄弟姊妹所进行的野蛮暴行也在到处继续发生。
    民族产业和农村经济也遭到了残酷的破坏，在城市和乡村，到处都有无数的失业者和断粮农民以及乞食的儿童在成群地流浪。
    这一切凄惨的景象和不幸的根源，完全在于朝鲜人民不共戴天的仇人——美国侵略军对共和国南半部的霸占。
    朝鲜劳动党和共和国政府，为了我们祖国的和平统一，屡次提出了合理的方案。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府，在今年2月5日又一次发表了一项声明。
    为世界和平的巩固和朝鲜问题的和平解决而始终一贯地作出努力的中华人民共和国政府，对朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明表明了全面的支持；中国人民志愿军也采取了在1958年年底以前全部撤出朝鲜的主动措施。
    朝中两国人民的这种主动措施，再一次明确地证实了我们两国人民的爱好和平的政策。
    但是，美帝国主义对于朝中两国政府关于和平统一朝鲜的方案，仍然不但不采取任何措施，反而在共和国南半部继续扩充它的军备，进行原子战争演习，横暴地蹂躏停战协定，在军事分界线上进行着一连串的挑拨行动。
    这样，披着羊皮的豺狼——美帝国主义，在全世界人民的面前，又一次赤裸裸地暴露出了自己的丑恶的本质。
    今天，美国侵略者，没有任何借口继续留驻共和国南半部，更没有任何借口，把他们自己的殖民地军事霸占加以合理化。
    只有美国侵略军队撤出共和国南半部，我们祖国的和平统一才能得到实现。
    美帝国主义不仅强占着我国的南半部，而且还霸占着中国领土的一部分——台湾，并且正在企图把它变为原子战争的基地。
    敌人的这种阴谋活动，是必定遭到粉碎的。台湾是属于中国人民的。中国人民一定会取得胜利。
    今天，我们所生活着的时代，是和平压倒战争，资本主义在全世界范围内趋向全面没落的历史性的转换时代。
    美帝国主义的任何阴谋，也绝不能阻挡得住为自己祖国的和平统一独立和国土完整而斗争的朝中两国人民的前进。
    有苏联、有中国、有社会主义阵营各国、有全世界爱好和平的人民的支持，朝鲜人民一定能够达到祖国的和平统一。
    我们朝鲜人民，在伟大的苏联、中华人民共和国和兄弟般的社会主义阵营各国的朋友以及全世界爱好和平人民的支持下，一定会把美帝国主义者赶出我们的疆土去，一定会永远捍卫住通过创造性的劳动斗争所取得的社会主义成果，一定会达成祖国的和平统一。
    朝鲜人民和中国人民，将会进一步巩固和发展两国人民之间传统的友谊团结，在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的旗帜下，将会永远并肩走向胜利。
    在这世界上，没有任何力量可以摧毁我们朝中两国人民的团结的力量。胜利是属于我们的。
    最后，我谨向不断地支持和援助朝鲜人民的中国共产党、中华人民共和国政府和中国人民，再一次表示热烈的谢意和最大的敬意。
    朝中两国人民的牢不可破的友谊团结万岁！
    以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营的统一团结万岁！
    全世界的持久和平万岁！
    光荣的中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
    中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万岁！（附图片）
