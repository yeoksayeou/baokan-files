　　Worldwide People Cheer the Ascent of the Red Giant Star
　　Congratulating the New Major Victory of Soviet Science and Technology
    This newspaper compiles reports. Xinhua News Agency reports: After the Soviet Union launched its third artificial Earth satellite on May 15th, it aroused great joy and cheers from people all over the world, who unanimously believed that launching such a large and heavy satellite was another major victory for Soviet science and technology. Newspapers in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, Albania, North Korea, Vietnam, India, Japan, Ceylon, Uruguay, and Argentina all published the news of the Soviet Union's successful launch of the third artificial Earth satellite in detail with large headlines and published commentaries. Radio stations also immediately broadcast this exciting news.
    The Italian Communist Party's newspaper "l'Unità" published a special edition to congratulate the new victory of Soviet science.
    Xinhua News Agency, May 16th: TASS Moscow reports: Sedov, Chairman of the Commission for Development of Interstellar Flight Work of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, said that the launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite is a new and tremendous achievement of Soviet scientists and engineers.
    Sedov pointed out that, in terms of its volume, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite is already capable of carrying people for spaceflight. However, it is still difficult to launch a manned satellite now. In addition to solving a series of physiological problems encountered by people in spaceflight in the satellite, it is also necessary to solve the fundamental problem of preserving and returning the artificial satellite to Earth.
    Sedov pointed out that, from the perspective of the further development of flying equipment, it is particularly meaningful to measure the collision of micro-meteorites with artificial satellites and to obtain new data on the internal and upper temperatures of artificial satellites.
    Sedov said that each new satellite launched by the Soviet Union provides broader possibilities for the development of science. It can be expected that there will be more amazing and important achievements in the future.

　　全世界人民欢呼红色巨星升空
　　祝贺苏联科学技术新的重大胜利
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯　苏联在5月15日发射了第三颗人造地球卫星以后，引起了全世界人民的莫大喜悦和欢呼，一致认为发射这样大和这样重的卫星是苏联科学技术上的又一重大的胜利。波兰、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、越南、印度、日本、锡兰、乌拉圭、阿根廷等国的报纸都用大标题详细登载了苏联成功地发射第三个人造地球卫星的消息，并发表了评论。各电台也立即广播了这一令人兴奋的消息。
    意大利共产党机关报“团结报”出版号外祝贺苏联科学的新胜利。
    据新华社16日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联科学院星际飞行工作发展委员会主席塞道夫说，苏联第三个人造卫星的发射是苏联科学家和工程师新的巨大的成就。
    塞道夫指出，就其体积来说，苏联第三个人造卫星已经可以载人作宇宙飞行了。但是现在就发射载人的卫星还有困难。除了要解决人在卫星中作宇宙飞行时所碰到的一系列生理问题外，还必须解决保存和使人造卫星回到地球上来这个根本问题。
    塞道夫指出，从飞行器具的进一步发展的观点来看，特别有意义的是测定微流星和人造卫星相碰撞情况以及获得人造卫星内部和上部温度的新的数据。
    塞道夫说，苏联每发射一个新卫星就为科学的发展提供更广泛的可能性。可以预期，将来定有更惊人和更重要的成就。
