Explanation of Terms:

    The Yellow River's midsummer flood is the Yellow River's major flood, which generally begins during the summer rainy season. The midsummer flood period is the most tense time for Yellow River flood control. The Yellow River's water volume may continue to rise after the "Beginning of Autumn" (立秋), and the rise in water level during this stage is generally called the "Autumn Flood."
