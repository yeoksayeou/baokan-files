Timely Summarization of Summer Harvest Experiences; Early Arrangement of Winter Planting Work:
Hubei Province Holds Winter Planting Meeting Ahead of Schedule

    (Our Reporter Fang Di reports) In order to promptly summarize and promote the high-yield experiences of advanced areas and to deploy this year's winter planting work, and to further arrange various rural tasks after the summer harvest, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial winter planting meeting in Xiangyang Prefecture from May 4th to 13th in the form of an on-site conference. The meeting decided that in the context of a bumper summer harvest, it is imperative to seize the opportunity and advance victoriously, striving to make the increase in the total output of grain, cotton, and oil crops in the province this year catch up with or exceed the increase in the output of similar crops in the past eight years. It also demanded that the yield of summer harvest crops be doubled again on the existing basis next year.

    This year's summer harvest crop production in Hubei Province is unprecedentedly good. According to preliminary estimates, the total output will reach 7-8 billion jin, equivalent to the total increase in summer harvest crops in the past two years. The high-yield situation in Xiangyang Prefecture is particularly prominent, with the estimated average yield per unit area of summer harvest crops in the entire prefecture reaching more than 300 jin, more than double that of last year. This prefecture answered a series of questions with facts, such as whether summer harvest crops can achieve high yields and on what kind of land high yields can be achieved. Therefore, this winter planting meeting focused on summarizing and promoting the successful experience of this prefecture, so that relevant experiences can blossom and bear fruit throughout the province, laying the foundation for further increasing production next year. This winter planting meeting was conducted in the form of field visits and debates, combined with indoor reports and research. After the meeting began, the participants visited Suixian, Zhaoyang and other counties and returned indoors on the 11th. Because it was done with facts, with typical examples, and with models for everything, the meeting was lively and effective. Representatives from Enshi Prefecture reflected that Xiangyang Prefecture's experience in achieving large-scale high yields helped them solve four long-standing ideological problems: "Condition Theory" - believing that the low yields in the past were due to poor natural conditions; "Habit Theory" - believing that the farming habits in the region were backward; "Empty Talk" - not paying attention to grasping the key to production in a practical way; "Willing to Lag Behind" - always feeling that their region is not good in all aspects and cannot catch up.

    During the meeting, Comrade Wang Yanchun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, made a report on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee. The report pointed out that in the context of a bumper summer harvest, it is imperative to seize the opportunity and advance victoriously; do not be arrogant and complacent and miss the opportunity. He said that the specific goals of advancing victoriously are: to achieve a bumper autumn harvest on the basis of a bumper summer harvest, and strive to make the total output of grain, cotton, and oil crops throughout the year catch up with or exceed the increase in the output of similar crops in the past eight years, with the slogan "Catch up with eight years in one year"; at the same time, we must make various preparations early, so that the total output of summer harvest crops next year will double again on the basis of this year's bumper harvest, that is, from 7-8 billion jin this year to 14-15 billion jin. The participants unanimously agreed that the above requirements of the Provincial Party Committee were realistic and were very confident in achieving these requirements.

    Holding the winter planting meeting early is an effective method of the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee. The fact that the Provincial Party Committee held the winter planting meeting in the form of an on-site conference before the wheat harvest is an affirmation and development of the experience of the Xiangyang Prefectural Party Committee. There are many benefits to this approach, the most important of which are: it is convenient to promptly summarize summer harvest experiences, to arrange winter planting work early on the basis of the summary, and to consider next year's production tasks when arranging winter planting. In this way, we can "grasp the first step and see the next step," "grasp this year and see next year," greatly strengthening the planning of leadership work and giving the vast number of cadres and the masses sufficient time to carry out various preparations. The meeting concluded on the evening of the 13th after a summary by Zhang Tixue, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee and Governor of the Province.

    More than 300 leading cadres from local prefectural committees, county committees and relevant agricultural departments attended the meeting. Representatives from Hunan, Henan, Beijing and other provinces and cities, the Rural Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences also attended the meeting as observers.

　　及时总结夏收经验　提早安排冬播工作
　　湖北省提前召开冬播会议
    本报讯　记者方堤报道：湖北省为了及时总结、推广先进地区的丰产经验和部署今年的冬播工作，并进一步对夏收后的各项农村工作进行安排，中共湖北省委从5月4日到13日在襄阳专区，以现场会的形式召开了全省冬播会议。会议决定在夏季大丰产的情况下，抓住时机，乘胜前进，力争今年全省粮食、棉花、油料作物的增产量赶上或超过过去八年同类作物增产量，并要求在明年使夏收作物的产量在已有基础上再翻一翻。
    今年湖北省的夏收作物生产情况空前良好，据初步估计，总产量将达到七、八十亿斤，相当于过去两年夏收作物的增产总量。其中襄阳专区的丰产情况尤为突出，估计全区夏收作物的平均单位面积产量将达到三百多斤，比去年增产一倍以上。这个专区用事实回答了夏收作物能不能高产和在什么样的土地上才能高产等一系列的问题。因此，这次冬播会议着重地总结和推广了这个专区的成功经验，以便使有关经验在全省开花结果，为明年再增产打下基础。这次冬播会议是采取田间参观、辩论为主，又结合室内报告、研究的形式进行的。会议开始后，与会者即先后在随县、枣阳等县进行了田间参观，到11日才转入室内。由于作到了用事实说话，样样有典型，事事有样板，使会议开得生动活泼，效果很好。恩施专区的代表反映，襄阳专区获得大面积丰产的经验帮助他们解决了长期以来未能很好解决的四大思想：“条件论”——认为过去产量不高是自然条件差；“习惯论”——认为本地区耕作习惯落后；“放空炮”——不注意切切实实地抓生产关键；“甘居落后”——总觉得自己地区各方面都不好，赶也赶不上。
    会议进行期中，省委书记王延春同志代表省委作了报告。报告指出，在夏收作物大丰收的情况下，一定要抓住时机，乘胜前进；不要闻胜而骄，坐失时机。他说，乘胜前进的具体目标是：在夏季大丰收的基础上使秋季也大丰收，力争全年的粮食、棉花和油料作物的总产量赶上或超过过去八年同类作物的增产量，口号是“一年赶八年”；同时，要及早进行各项准备，使明年的夏收作物总产量在今年丰产的基础上再翻一翻，即由今年的七十——八十亿斤，增加到一百四十——一百五十亿斤。与会者一致认为省委的上述要求是切合实际的，对实现这些要求很有信心。
    把冬播会议提早举行是襄阳地委行之有效的方法。这次省委在麦收前即以现场会形式召开冬播会议，是肯定和发展了襄阳地委经验的结果。这种作法的好处很多，最重要的是：它便于及时地总结夏收经验，在总结的基础上对冬播工作早作安排，还便于在安排冬播时考虑到明年生产任务。这样就作到了“抓住头一步、看到下一步”、“抓住今年、看到明年”、使领导工作的计划性大大加强、使广大干部和群众都有充分的时间来进行各项准备工作。会议在13日晚上由省委书记、省长张体学同志总结后宣告结束。
    参加这次会议的有各地委、县委第一书记和有关农业部门的负责干部共三百多人。湖南、河南、北京等省市、中共中央农村工作部、农业部、中国农业科学院等部门，也派了代表列席会议。
