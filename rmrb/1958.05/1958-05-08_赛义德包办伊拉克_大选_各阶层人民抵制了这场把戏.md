Xinhua News Agency, 6th, Baghdad dispatch: An Iraqi so-called parliamentary election, tightly controlled by the government, was held on May 5th.

Of the parliament's one hundred and forty-five seats, only sixteen were elected by popular vote. The other one hundred and twenty-nine were all "naturally elected" because the candidates had no opponents. Supporters of the current Prime Minister Nuri al-Said won one hundred and thirty seats, and the remaining fifteen elected were people who "did not oppose" Said. Since all political parties had been dissolved by the government in 1954, the elected members are considered non-partisan "independents."

This election was met with resolute and unanimous boycott from all opposition parties, who refused to participate in the election and called on the people to hold a general strike to protest the government's fabrication of public opinion. According to Damascus newspaper reports, strikes began in many places in Iraq, including Mosul, Basra, Kerbala, Hilla, and Najaf, from noon on May 4th. The government sent troops to these places to suppress the strikes, and a large number of people were arrested. On the day of the vote, there were no slogans, no leaflets, and no one giving campaign speeches on the streets of the capital, Baghdad. Western news agencies reported that the public had no interest in the election and there was no sign that an election was taking place.

The reason why this Iraqi election was widely boycotted by people from all walks of life is that the broad masses of the people are extremely dissatisfied with the Iraqi ruling clique's disregard for the interests of the Arab nation, its following of imperialist countries, and its implementation of policies that undermine Arab unity. One of the purposes of Said's government dissolving parliament immediately after returning to power in March was to elect a new parliament to pass a bill to amend the Iraqi constitution, so that the new parliament could approve the constitution of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation in accordance with the amended Iraqi constitution. Although the previous parliament had passed the bill to amend the constitution before it was dissolved, the bill could not take effect because, according to the Iraqi constitution, any amendment to the constitution must be approved by two parliaments.

From the signing of the Iraqi-Jordanian Federation agreement to the eve of this election, protest demonstrations by people from all walks of life in Iraq against the current ruling group's pursuit of policies that violate the interests of the Arab nation have lasted for three months. The strata participating in the protest movement are unprecedentedly broad. Many influential and well-known figures, including former Senate Speaker Habibi, former Prime Minister Pashetshi, and former Independent Party leader Beh, also jointly wrote letters to the government protesting the government's policies.

### 赛义德包办伊拉克“大选”  各阶层人民抵制了这场把戏

    赛义德包办伊拉克“大选”
    各阶层人民抵制了这场把戏
    新华社6日讯　巴格达消息：伊拉克5月5日举行了一次由政府严密控制的所谓议会选举。
    在议会的一百四十五个席位中，由选民投票选出的只有十六席，其他一百二十九席由于候选人没有竞选对手而全部“自然当选”。现任首相努里·赛义德的支持者取得了一百三十个席位，其余十五个当选者都是“不反对”赛义德的人。由于所有的政党都已经在1954年被政府解散，这次选出的议员都算是无党派“独立人士”。
    这次大选遭到了所有反对派坚决、一致的抵制，它们拒绝参加竞选，并且号召人民举行总罢工来抗议政府伪造民意的行为。据大马士革报纸消息，在伊拉克的摩苏尔、巴士拉、克伯拉、希拉、纳加夫等许多地方，从5月4日中午开始了罢工，政府派了军队到这些地方去镇压，有大批人被捕。在举行投票的这一天，首都巴格达的大街上没有标语、没有传单、没有人发表竞选演说。西方通讯社的消息说，公众对这次选举毫无兴趣，没有一点迹象表明这里是在举行大选。
    这次伊拉克大选所以遭到各阶层人民广泛的抵制，是由于广大人民极度不满意伊拉克统治集团不顾阿拉伯民族利益、追随帝国主义国家、执行破坏阿拉伯团结的政策。赛义德政府在3月间重新上台以后马上解散议会的目的之一是要选出一个新议会来通过一项修改伊拉克宪法的法案，以便使新议会根据修改后的伊拉克宪法来批准伊拉克—约旦联邦的宪法。上届议会在被解散以前虽然已经通过了修改宪法的法案，但是这项法案还不能生效，因为根据伊拉克宪法规定，对宪法的任何修改必须得到两届议会的批准。
    从伊拉克—约旦联邦协定签订以后到这次大选前夕为止，伊拉克各阶层人民反对目前统治集团奉行违反阿拉伯民族利益的抗议示威运动已经持续了三个月之久。参加抗议运动的阶层空前广泛。包括前参院议长哈比比、前首相帕舍特希、前独立党领袖贝赫等许多有影响的著名人士也都联名写信给政府，抗议政府奉行的政策。
