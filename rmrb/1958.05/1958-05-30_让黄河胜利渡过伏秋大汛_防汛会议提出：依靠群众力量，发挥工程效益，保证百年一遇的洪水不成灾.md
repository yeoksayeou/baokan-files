Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 28th. The Yellow River Flood Control Meeting, which closed here on the 26th, decided that this year's Yellow River flood control task is to ensure that floods occurring once a century, with a peak flow of 25,000 cubic meters per second at the Qinchan Hydrological Station, do not cause breaches or changes in course; and to have countermeasures and preparations in place when even larger floods of various types occur, striving for the greatest victory in the flood control struggle. It is required to maximize the benefits of existing projects and fully utilize the river's flood discharge capacity, striving to avoid flood storage and disaster even when the flood exceeds the guaranteed water level by 3.5 meters.

The meeting, convened by the Yellow River Flood Control Headquarters, believes that this year's Yellow River flood control is of even greater significance. Since the Yellow River came under the control of the people, it has successfully passed through eleven flood seasons. In two more years, the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project, which focuses on flood control, will begin to block floods. As socialist construction makes great leaps forward in all aspects, ensuring the victory of Yellow River flood control in the next two years is even more important.

The meeting emphasized the importance of strengthening political and ideological work, mobilizing the masses, relying on the masses, and combining flood control with production in the flood control struggle. To prevent possible early floods, the meeting decided to begin reporting floods on June 15th. Before June 20th, flood control organizations at all levels must be restored, materials prepared, a comprehensive inspection and engineering appraisal of the dike lines conducted, and flood control and rescue techniques widely disseminated.

To enhance the material strength of flood control and save state expenditures, the meeting called for a movement among the flood control teams to contribute one cubic meter of prepared flood control soil per person before the flood season.

The Yellow River has overcome eleven years of flood seasons, laying the foundation for continuing to overcome floods. The decision to block floods one year ahead of schedule for the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Project is also an important sign of fundamentally changing the natural face of the Yellow River. Last winter and this spring, a large number of water conservancy and soil conservation projects were built in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, which, under normal circumstances, can reduce runoff and weaken flood peaks. These achievements are great and are all favorable conditions for flood control. However, some cadres and the masses have developed blindly optimistic and lax thinking. Some believe that many soil conservation projects have been carried out in the middle and upper reaches, and there will be no more major floods in the future. The meeting criticized these incorrect ideas. The meeting requested that we neither be blindly optimistic nor be intimidated by difficulties. By seizing favorable conditions and facing difficulties squarely, we can continue to achieve victory in flood control.

    让黄河胜利渡过伏秋大汛
    防汛会议提出：依靠群众力量，发挥工程效益，保证百年一遇的洪水不成灾
    据新华社郑州28日电　26日在此间闭幕的黄河防汛会议决定：黄河今年的防汛任务，是以确保百年一遇的洪水，秦厂水文站洪峰流量二万五千秒公方时，不发生决口和改道；并且做到当发生各种类型的更大洪水时有对策，有准备，争取防汛斗争的最大胜利。要求发挥现有工程的最大效益和充分利用河道排洪能力，争取洪水超过保证水位三点五公寸的情况下，不滞洪，不成灾。
    这次由黄河防汛总指挥部召开的会议认为，今年黄河防汛有着更加重大的意义。黄河自归人民治理以来，已经胜利地渡过了十一年的伏秋大汛，再有两年，以防洪为主的三门峡水利枢纽就要开始拦洪。当社会主义建设在各方面大跃进的时候，今、明两年保证黄河防汛的胜利就更为重要。
    会议强调了防汛斗争中加强政治思想工作，和发动群众，依靠群众，防汛和生产结合的重要性。为了预防可能提早到来的洪水，会议决定6月15日开始报汛。在6月20日前，各级防汛组织要恢复起来，备妥料物，对堤线进行普遍检查和工程鉴定，广泛传授防汛抢险技术。
    为了增强防汛的物质力量和节约国家开支，会议要求在防汛队伍中开展一个汛前每人献一公方备防土的运动。
    黄河已经战胜了十一年的伏秋大汛，为继续战胜洪水奠定了基础。三门峡水利枢纽已经决定提前一年拦洪，也是基本改变黄河自然面貌的重要标志。去冬今春，黄河中、下游兴修了大量的水利和保持水土的工程，在一般情况下，可以起到减少径流，削弱洪峰的作用。这些成绩是很伟大的，都是防汛的有利条件。但有不少干部和群众因此产生了盲目乐观的麻痹思想。有的认为中、上游已经做了许多保持水土的工程，今后不会再有大水了。会议批判了这些不正确的思想。会议要求：既不要盲目乐观，也不要被困难吓倒。要抓紧有利条件，正视困难，就能继续取得防汛的胜利。
