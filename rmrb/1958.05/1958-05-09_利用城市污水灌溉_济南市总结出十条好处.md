Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 8th - The Jinan City Construction Bureau recently summarized the benefits of using urban sewage to irrigate suburban farmland, and decided to promote this method throughout the city in the future.

The benefits of using urban sewage for irrigating farmland can be summarized as "one more, two fast, three good, and four saves." "One more" means more crop yield; "Two fast" means crops grow faster, and building sewage irrigation projects is faster than building irrigation projects using other water sources; "Three good" means it's good for not polluting urban drinking water, good for improving the soil, and good for resolving the contradiction between industrial and agricultural water use; "Four saves" means it saves investment in constructing sewage irrigation projects, saves labor, saves maintenance and management costs, and saves suburban farmers fertilizer costs.

For three years, five agricultural cooperatives in Jinan's suburbs, including Qin Jian, have been using urban sewage to irrigate vegetable gardens and farmland, with an irrigation area of more than 3,300 mu. Before Xingfu Zhilu Agricultural Cooperative used sewage to irrigate wheat, each mu produced 300 jin of wheat. After using sewage for irrigation, each mu produced 500 to 600 jin, and the wheat grains were plump. The wheat seedlings used to be yellow, but after being irrigated with sewage twice, they turned dark green and black. Corn planted in wheat fields irrigated with sewage has 600 to 900 grains per ear, and each mu can produce 1,000 jin. Corn not irrigated with sewage has 430 grains per ear, and the yield per mu is no more than 500 jin. In 1956, Liguo Agricultural Cooperative used sewage to grow 15 mu of rice. Without applying much fertilizer, the average yield was 675 jin per mu. The yield of vegetables irrigated with sewage is also very high. For example, spinach irrigated with sewage weighs 6 to 8 liang per plant, while spinach not irrigated with sewage weighs only 2 liang per plant; scallions not irrigated with sewage produce 150 jin per ridge, while those irrigated with sewage produce 300 jin.

    利用城市污水灌溉
    济南市总结出十条好处
    新华社济南8日电　济南市城市建设局最近总结了利用城市污水灌溉郊区农田的好处，确定今后在全市推广这个办法。
    利用城市污水灌溉农田的好处，概括地说来有一多二快三好四省。一多是农作物产量多；二快是农作物生长快，修建污水灌溉工程比修建其他水源的灌溉工程快；三好是不污染城市饮用水好，改良土壤好，解决工农业用水矛盾好；四省是修建污水灌溉工程投资省，建设人工省，维持管理费用省，郊区农民所需肥料省。
    济南市郊区勤俭等五个农业社，利用城市污水灌溉菜园农田已有三年历史，灌溉面积达三千三百多亩。幸福之路农业社没用污水浇麦以前，每亩产小麦三百斤，用污水浇后，每亩产五百斤到六百斤，而且麦粒饱满。原来麦苗发黄，浇上两遍污水就变为深绿发黑了。污水浇的麦田再种玉米，每穗有六百到九百粒，每亩能产一千斤，未用污水浇的每穗四百三十粒，每亩产量最多不过五百斤。利国农业社在1956年利用污水种了十五亩稻，施肥不多，平均每亩还产六百七十五斤。利用污水浇的菜产量也很高，如用污水浇的菠菜每棵重六两到半斤，而没用污水浇的每棵仅重二两；葱未用污水浇的每畦产一百五十斤，用污水浇就产三百斤。
