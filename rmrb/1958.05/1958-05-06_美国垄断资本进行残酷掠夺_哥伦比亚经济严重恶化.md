　　Xinhua News Agency, May 5th dispatch from Montevideo, May 4th: The "Political Documents" gazette published in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, stated that the Colombian economy has seriously deteriorated: prices are constantly rising, industrial development is lagging behind, coffee exports are difficult, workers' wages are very low, and urban and rural unemployment is increasing.
　　The article points out that the main reasons for Colombia's economic backwardness and the people's poverty are the feudalism and imperialism that rule Colombia's economy. As of the beginning of 1957, the total amount of foreign investment in Colombia reached 710 million US dollars, of which American capital accounted for half. The mining of platinum, gold, and various non-ferrous metals is almost entirely controlled by large American companies.

    美国垄断资本进行残酷掠夺
    哥伦比亚经济严重恶化
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社蒙得维的亚4日讯：在哥伦比亚首都波哥大出版的“政治文献”公报说，哥伦比亚经济严重恶化：物价不断高涨，工业发展落后，咖啡出口困难，职工工资很低，城乡失业增加。
    文章指出，哥伦比亚经济落后和人民贫困的主要原因是哥伦比亚经济中封建主义和帝国主义的统治。截至1957年初，外国人在哥伦比亚的投资总数达七亿一千万美元，其中美国资本占一半。白金、黄金和各种有色金属的开采几乎完全掌握在美国大公司的手里。
