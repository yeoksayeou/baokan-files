Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 8th: The weather in Czechoslovakia is currently warm, and farmers and workers at machine tractor stations are seizing the opportunity to intensify spring planting.

According to the latest news, spring planting is nearing completion nationwide. Agricultural production cooperatives have completed 95% of their grain sowing, and the national average for sowing work is 92%. Sugar beet planting has been completed 90% nationwide, and has been fully completed in the Slovak region.

This year, due to the late arrival of spring and cold weather, spring planting in the Czechoslovak countryside was delayed by about a month. However, as soon as the weather improved, the farmers boosted their enthusiasm and threw themselves into spring planting. For example, in the Czech region, agricultural laborers completed 50% of all sugar beet planting in the past week, covering an area of approximately 86,000 hectares. It is expected that if cultivation work is done well in the coming period, this year's harvest will not be affected by the delay in spring planting.

    捷克斯洛伐克农民
    鼓起干劲　完成春播
    新华社布拉格8日电　目前，捷克斯洛伐克的天气暖和，农民们和机器拖拉机站的工人们正在抓紧时机，加紧进行春播工作。
    据最新的消息，全国的春播工作已接近完成。农业生产合作社的谷物播种工作已经完成了95％，全国范围内的播种工作平均完成了92％。甜菜的种植工作在全国范围内已经完成了90％，斯洛伐克地区已经全部完成。
    今年，由于春天姗姗来迟，气候寒冷，捷克斯洛伐克农村的春播工作曾经延迟了约一个月。但是，当天气刚一转好，农民们就鼓足干劲，投入春播工作中。例如，在捷克地区，农业劳动者在上一星期内就完成了全部甜菜的种植工作的50％，种植面积约达八万六千公顷。预计，如果今后一个时期的耕耘工作作得好，今年的收获将不致因为春播推迟而受到影响。
