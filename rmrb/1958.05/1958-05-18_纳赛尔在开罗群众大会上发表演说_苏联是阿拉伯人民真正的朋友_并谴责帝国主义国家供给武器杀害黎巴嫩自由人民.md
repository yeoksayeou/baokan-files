Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 17th - Arab Republic President Nasser, shortly after returning to Cairo from the Soviet Union on the 16th, stated at a mass rally that his visit to the Soviet Union was a manifestation of the Arab Republic's independent policy and a reflection of friendship and peaceful coexistence between nations.

He said that his talks with Soviet leaders were "talks between the strong and free Arab people and a friendly nation with no ulterior motives."

Nasser addressed tens of thousands of people from the balcony of the presidential palace, saying that he found Soviet leaders and the people to have great respect and value for the policy of active neutrality and non-alignment. He also witnessed throughout the Soviet Union support for Arabs and those friendly to Arabs, and support for the Arab people's struggle for freedom and independence. During his visit, he expressed gratitude to the Soviet people "for their cooperation with us in our difficult days, because a friend in need is a friend indeed. They have given us aid when our country was invaded, in times of difficulty, and when our country was subjected to economic blockade."

President Nasser refuted the Lebanese government's accusations that the Arab Republic supported the recent conflicts in Lebanon. He said, "The purpose behind this accusation is to find an excuse for foreign intervention." He also stated that imperialist countries are supplying weapons to kill the free people of Lebanon. He pointed out that they will be defeated.

He also announced full support for Indonesia against foreign intervention. He said, "We hope that we will always see the Indonesian people living a unified, free, strong, independent, and stable life."

When President Nasser spoke about the Arab Republic's relations with the United States, he said, "We are prepared to forget the past, but we will not allow any country or anyone to infringe upon our country's independence or dignity." He said that before he left for the Soviet Union, the United States had informed him that it intended to adopt a new policy towards the Arab Republic.

    纳赛尔在开罗群众大会上发表演说
　　苏联是阿拉伯人民真正的朋友
    并谴责帝国主义国家供给武器杀害黎巴嫩自由人民
    据新华社开罗17日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔16日从苏联回到开罗后不久在一次群众大会上说，他对苏联的访问是阿拉伯联合共和国的独立政策的体现，是友谊和国家之间的和平共处的体现。
    他说，他同苏联领袖们的会谈是“强大而自由的阿拉伯人民同一个没有什么企图的友好国家之间的会谈。”
    纳赛尔在总统府阳台上对好几万人发表演说，他说，他发现苏联领袖和人民都非常尊重和重视积极中立和不结盟的政策。他在苏联各地还看到对阿拉伯人和同阿拉伯人友好的支持，对阿拉伯人争取自由和独立的斗争的支持。他在访问期间曾经表示感谢苏联人民“在我们的艰难的日子里同我们进行合作，因为患难中的朋友才是真朋友。在我国遭到侵略的时候，在困难的时候，和在我国受到经济封锁的时候，他们都给了我们援助”。
    纳赛尔总统驳斥了黎巴嫩政府提出的阿拉伯联合共和国支持最近在黎巴嫩发生的冲突的指责。他说，“这种指责的背后的目的是要为外国干涉找借口”。他还说，帝国主义国家供应武器来杀害黎巴嫩的自由人民。他指出，它们将遭到失败。
    他还宣布充分支持印度尼西亚反对外国干涉。他说，“我们希望，我们将永远看到印度尼西亚人民过着统一、自由、强盛、独立和稳定的生活。”
    纳赛尔总统在谈到阿拉伯联合共和国同美国的关系的时候说：“我们准备忘记过去，但是我们不容许任何国家或任何人侵犯我国的独立或尊严。”他说，在他动身前往苏联之前，美国曾经通知他说，它打算对阿拉伯联合共和国采取新的政策。
