    Combining Points and Surfaces, Integrating Popularization and Improvement
    Zunyi Area Uniformly Arranges City and County Industries
    (Our newspaper, Zunyi, May 2nd, reporter Guo Longchun) Guizhou Province’s Zunyi area is adopting a method of combining points and surfaces, integrating popularization and improvement, to enable city industry and county industry to collaborate and cooperate for a joint leap forward.
    The Zunyi area has twelve counties and one city—Zunyi City. In the process of large-scale development of local industries, the counties need Zunyi City to support them with equipment and technical forces, and Zunyi City needs the counties to supply large quantities of raw materials. After the city and counties separately build a number of factories and mines, some factories with the same nature also need to be uniformly arranged in terms of raw material supply and product division. The Zunyi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China pays close attention to organizing cooperation between the city and counties, and recently convened a coordination meeting of the heads of the thirteen counties and cities to make specific arrangements on how the city and county industries can support and cooperate with each other on the basis of each region's self-reliance.
    Zunyi City is actively producing and trial-manufacturing ordinary small equipment needed by the counties to run industries. According to the contracts signed at the coordination meeting, Zunyi City will supply the counties with 110 small machine tools, 120 blowers, and 180 water turbines this year, as well as a batch of pulpers, centrifuges, and other equipment. This can largely meet the counties' needs for ordinary small equipment this year. In terms of manpower, Zunyi City will transfer 100 technicians to the counties this year and has already started to transfer them. The city will also run a technical school to train 800 workers for the counties; registration has already begun. This year, the raw materials needed by Zunyi City's industrial enterprises, such as gallnut and *Quercus dentata* bowls and hogs needed by comprehensive chemical plants and canneries, a large amount of pig iron needed for manufacturing agricultural tools and machines, and straw and wild jute needed for manufacturing rayon, have been actively supplied by the counties after this consultation, and have been basically met.
    For the city and county factories that are of the same nature, the Prefectural Committee proposed to appropriately divide the products, requiring the city-owned factories to produce higher-grade products and improve product quality. This meeting specifically arranged the division of labor for agricultural tool factories. The manufacturing of old agricultural tools and general agricultural tool repair services are to be undertaken by the county agricultural tool factories; the city agricultural tool factory is responsible for manufacturing more complex new agricultural tools such as seeders and paddy field harrows, and has begun manufacturing simple machinery and power equipment. At present, the Zunyi City Agricultural Tool Factory has trial-produced products such as water pumps and blowers, and is trial-producing electric bench drills, water turbines, and other machinery. These are all new products of Zunyi City. Zunyi City's Guoguang Soap Factory and other enterprises are also preparing to start producing scented soaps, toothpastes, and other products. This will further advance Zunyi City's industry.

    点与面结合　普及与提高结合
    遵义地区统一安排市县工业
    本报遵义2日电　记者郭龙春报道：贵州省遵义地区采取点面结合，普及与提高相结合的办法，使市工业和县工业协作配合，共同跃进。
    遵义地区有十二个县和一个市——遵义市。在大规模发展地方工业的过程中，各县需要遵义市支援设备和技术力量，遵义市需要各县供应大批原料。市、县分别新建一批厂矿以后，有些性质相同的工厂，在原料供应、产品分工等方面也需要统一安排。中共遵义地委很注意组织市、县之间的协作，最近召集十三个县、市的负责人举行协作会议，在各地自力更生的基础上，对市、县工业如何互相支援、分工协作做了具体安排。
    各县办工业需要的普通小型设备，遵义市都积极生产和试制。根据协作会议上签订的合同，遵义市今年将供给各县小型机床一百一十台，鼓风机一百二十台，水轮机一百八十台，另外还有一批打浆机、离心机等设备。这样，可以在很大程度上满足各县今年对普通小型设备的需要。在人力方面，遵义市今年要调给各县一百名技工，现在已着手抽调。这个市还要举办技工学校，为各县培养八百名工人；现在学员已经开始报到了。遵义市工业企业今年所需要的原料，综合化工厂、罐头厂等所需要的五棓子、青杠碗和毛猪，制造农具、机器需要的大量生铁，以及制造人造棉所需要的稻草、野麻等原料，经过这次协商，各县都表示积极供应，基本上得到了满足。
    对于市、县部分同性质的工厂，地委提出要适当进行产品分工，要求市属工厂生产较高级的产品，提高产品质量。这次会议具体安排了农具厂的分工问题。旧农具制造和一般农具修理业务，都由县农具厂担任；市农具厂负责制造播种机、水田耙等较复杂的新式农具，并开始制造简单的机械和动力设备。目前，遵义市农具厂已经试制成水泵、鼓风机等产品，正在试制电动台钻、水轮机等机械。这些都是遵义市的新产品。遵义市国光肥皂厂等企业也准备开始生产香皂、牙膏等产品。这都将使遵义市的工业向前跃进一步。
