    No Need for So Many Nipples
    I have been using small-mouth bottles to feed my child, and the bottles often break easily. Originally, if the bottle broke, all I needed was a new bottle, but the stores insist on selling bottles and nipples as a set. The day before yesterday, the bottle broke again, and I thought that now that we are in a period of rectification, perhaps the system of selling sets would have changed. But it was still the same as before, still selling them as a set. I asked, "Why?" The salesperson said, "The bottles and nipples come as a set, and if we sell them separately, we can't price them." There was no other way, so I had to save the two extra nipples that I bought. Buying one extra nipple at a time doesn't cost much, but buying them often, and then not using them, is indeed wasteful. I hope that the commercial departments will consider abolishing the system of selling bottles and nipples as a set.

    不需要这样多的奶头
    我一直用小口奶瓶给小孩喂奶，奶瓶常常容易坏。本来奶瓶坏了，只要配一个新奶瓶就成了，可是商店里却要奶瓶奶头成套卖。前天，奶瓶又坏了，心里想现在正当整改时期，成套卖的制度也许会改变了吧。那知道还是和以前一样，仍旧要卖成套的。我问：“为什么？”营业员说：“奶瓶奶头是成套来的，拆开卖就无法估价。”没办法，我只得把多买的两个奶头存起来。一次多买一个奶头花不了多少钱，但是常常买，买来又不用，也确是浪费。希望商业部门考虑取消奶瓶奶头成套卖的制度。
