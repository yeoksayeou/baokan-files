During the time I worked with Comrade Lai Ruoyu at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I was deeply moved and educated by Comrade Ruoyu's spirit of adhering to principles and his leadership and working methods of relying on the Party and the masses. He was good at promptly writing written reports to the Central Committee, reflecting the new situations and problems discovered in his daily work and the opinions of the Party Group of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, so that the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions could receive timely instructions and support from the Party Central Committee, thus enabling the work of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions to be carried out more smoothly.

He was also good at discovering and boldly supporting new things that emerged among the masses. In 1953, he went to Shenyang, Anshan and other places to inspect work and visited the technical reform exhibition held in Anshan. He believed that such technical reforms by the workers were the fundamental way to reduce the labor intensity of workers and greatly improve labor productivity. After returning from the Northeast, he wrote a report to the Central Committee, suggesting that the Anshan Technical Innovation Exhibition be moved to Beijing for an expanded exhibition, and mobilizing and organizing workers, staff, and cadres from Party, government, trade union, and Youth League organizations in enterprises across the country to visit Beijing. Under his active advocacy and support, the technical innovation movement once developed vigorously among the masses of workers and staff across the country. Now, under the new situation of the nationwide rectification movement, breaking down superstitions, and ideological emancipation, under the illumination of the general line and general policy of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results put forward by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and under the call for technological revolution and cultural revolution put forward by the Party, the nationwide technical innovation movement of the people of the whole country is developing on a larger scale and at a faster speed across the country. How much we need Comrade Ruoyu's spirit of continuous innovation!

Comrade Lai Ruoyu has bid farewell to us forever, but his attitude of serving the working class wholeheartedly, his spirit of adhering to principles and positions, and his noble qualities as a Communist Party member, such as his leadership methods and working methods of relying on the Party and relying on the masses, will forever live in my heart!

    悼念若愚同志
    刘子久
    当我在中华全国总工会和赖若愚同志一道工作的时间里，若愚同志遇事坚持原则的精神和善于依靠党、依靠群众的领导方法和工作方法，使我深受感动和教益。他善于把在日常工作中所发现新的情况、问题和全总党组的意见，及时地写成书面报告向中央反映，使全总的工作能够及时地得到党中央的指示和支持，从而使全总的工作也就能够得到比较顺利的开展。
    他又善于发现并且大胆地支持群众中出现的新鲜事物。1953年，他到沈阳、鞍山等地去视察工作，参观了在鞍山举办的技术改革展览会。他认为职工群众的这种技术改革，是减轻工人的劳动强度、大大地提高劳动生产率的根本办法。他从东北回来之后，就向中央写了报告，建议把鞍山的技术革新展览会移到北京扩大举办展览，并且动员组织全国各地工人职员和企业中党、政、工、团的干部来北京参观。在他的这种积极地倡导和支持之下，技术革新运动，在全国职工群众中，曾有过蓬蓬勃勃地发展。现在全国人民的技术革新运动，已在全民整风运动、破除迷信、思想解放的新情势下，在毛主席和党中央提出的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多、快、好、省地建设社会主义的总方针、总路线的照耀下，在党所提出的技术革命和文化革命的号召下，以更大的规模，更快的速度在全国范围内开展起来。我们多么需要若愚同志的那种不断革新的精神啊！
    赖若愚同志与我们永别了，但是他那种全心全意为工人阶级服务的态度，他那种坚持原则、立场的精神和他那种善于依靠党、依靠群众的领导方法和工作方法等共产党员的高贵品质，却永远活在我的心里！
