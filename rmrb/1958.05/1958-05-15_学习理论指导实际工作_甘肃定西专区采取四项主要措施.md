This dispatch from Lanzhou, May 13th: The Dingxi Special District of Gansu Province, in cultivating a contingent of socialist theory workers, focuses on current practical issues of revolution and construction to study Marxism-Leninism, closely integrating the study of theory with guiding current practical work.

By the beginning of March, the Dingxi Special District had allocated nearly five hundred full-time and part-time theory instructors and over one thousand theory study counselors. All ten counties in the district had established lecture groups, each with five to seven full-time lecturers and twenty-five to thirty lecture stations. The study of socialist education courses began comprehensively at the beginning of March.

After the rectification movement, the biggest feature of this special district's cultivation of a theoretical workforce is the close integration of theoretical study with guiding current practical work. The main measures that the district has taken in this regard are: First, all full-time instructors from the special district's lecturer corps and the county lecturer groups, except for a few who remain in the special district and county offices for teaching, are sent down to production and work units to participate in actual struggles in rural areas, so that they learn while doing, and teach while learning, acting as both teachers and students. Second, establish “experimental fields” for theoretical work, in order to create experience on how to ensure that theory teachers are consistent in theory and practice, are able to lecture, integrate theory with practice to promote Marxism-Leninism, and have experience in transforming their thinking. Each county has now established one to two such "experimental fields." Third, leading cadres of Party committees at all levels and full-time instructors jointly organize "thesis groups" or "editorial groups," combined with local practice, to determine theoretical research topics for solving major problems in practical work using Marxist-Leninist theory, and frequently write articles, theses, editorials, or work experience summaries for provincial or special district newspapers. The district plans to complete three hundred topics this year. Currently, the Dingxi Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China has organized five "editorial groups" according to political and legal affairs, industry, transportation, finance and trade, agriculture, forestry, water conservancy, animal husbandry, and culture, education, and health. More than thirty of the main responsible cadres have participated. The first batch of more than fifty research topics has been put forward, including the general line of socialist construction, the technological revolution, as well as water and soil conservation, soil improvement, greening, and other aspects. The special district's lecturer corps also organized nine theoretical special research groups, which went to various counties to conduct practical investigation of special topics through participating in actual struggles, visiting advanced things, and investigating the revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and peasants. Fourth, it is required that cadres in various work departments first talk about ideology and theory when reporting on work, to further promote all cadres to pay attention to the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, requiring that more than three thousand of the more than thirty thousand cadres in the district reach the level of intermediate theory instructors within two years. The existing four hundred part-time theory instructors all have the Marxist-Leninist theoretical cultivation of five courses.

Now, a high tide of linking practice to the study of Marxist-Leninist theory has begun throughout the district. More than 20,000 rural cadres in the district have participated in the study of socialist education courses. Leading cadres of Party committees at all levels personally serve as theory instructors or counselors, and personally grasp the theoretical study of cadres, personally write lectures, and help theory instructors revise lectures. In terms of lesson preparation methods, theory instructors in various places have also corrected the past tendency of "preparing lessons behind closed doors" and "teaching without teaching people, managing teaching without managing learning," and generally adopted the mass line method of lesson preparation, first holding a study debate, letting students speak out freely and debate, teachers and students participate in the debate together, find problems, provide guidance, solve problems, and finally make a summary speech.

　　学习理论指导实际工作
　　甘肃定西专区采取四项主要措施
    本报兰州13日电　甘肃省定西专区，在培养社会主义理论工作队伍中，以当前革命和建设实际问题为中心来学习马列主义，把学习理论与指导当前实际工作密切结合起来。
    定西专区到3月初，已经配备了近五百名专职和兼职理论教员，一千多名理论学习辅导员，全区十个县都成立了讲师小组；每县都有五至七个专职讲师，有二十五个到三十个讲授站。社会主义教育课程的学习已于3月初全面开始。
    经过整风运动以后，这个专区培养理论工作队伍的最大特点，是理论学习与指导当前实际工作紧密结合。全区在这方面已经采取的主要措施是：一、将专区讲师团和县的讲师小组的专职教员，除留少数人在专、县机关担任教学以外，全部下放到生产和工作单位，使他们深入农村，参加实际斗争，做到边做边学，边教边学，既当先生又当学生。二、建立理论工作的“试验田”，以便创造如何使理论教员作到理论与实践相一致，既会讲课，结合实际宣传马列主义，又有改造思想的经验。现在每个县都已建立一个到两个这样的“试验田”。三、各级党委负责干部和专职教员共同组织“论文小组”或“社论小组”，结合当地实际，定出运用马列主义理论解决实际工作中重大问题的理论研究专题，经常为省报或专区报纸写文章、论文、社论或工作经验总结等。全区计划今年完成三百个题目，现在中共定西地委，已按政法、工业、交通、财贸、农林水牧、文教卫生五个方面，组织了五个“社论小组”参加的主要负责干部已有三十多人，第一批五十多个研究专题已经提出，其中包括社会主义建设总路线问题、技术革命问题，以及水土保持、改良土壤、绿化等各个方面。专区讲师团并组织了九个理论专题研究小组，分赴各县，通过参加实际斗争，参观先进事物，考察工农群众的革命干劲等活动，进行专题研究的实际调查工作。四、要求各个工作部门的干部在汇报工作情况时，要首先谈思想、谈理论，进一步推动全体干部重视马列主义理论的学习，要求两年全区三万多名干部中，有三千多人达到中级理论教员的水平，现有四百多名兼职理论教员，都具备五门课程的马列主义理论修养。
    现在全区已经开始掀起联系实际学习马列主义理论的高潮。全区农村干部已有两万多人参加社会主义教育课程的学习。各级党委负责干部，都亲自担任理论教员或辅导员，并亲自抓干部的理论学习工作，亲自动手写讲稿和帮助理论教员修改讲稿。各地理论教员在备课方法上，也纠正了过去“关门备课”和“教学不教人，管教不管学”的偏向，普遍采取群众路线的备课方法、先举行学习辩论会，让学员大鸣大放大辩论，教员和学员一起参加辩论，从中发现问题，进行辅导，解决问题，最后作讲授的总结发言。
