Xinhua News Agency, 4th. To commemorate the first anniversary of the publication of Chairman Mao’s “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People,” the Chinese Philosophical Society and the Philosophy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences held an academic symposium in Beijing on the 2nd and 3rd, to study and discuss this work. More than 180 researchers in philosophy, economics, and history from Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Hebei, Shandong and other places participated in the symposium.

The symposium, based on the philosophical issues raised in Chairman Mao's work, combined with the current revolutionary practice in our country, especially in connection with the new situation of the current nationwide Great Leap Forward, and in the spirit of letting a hundred flowers bloom, launched theoretical exposition and discussion from various aspects. Over the past two days, the speakers have stated that Chairman Mao's work is a major development of Marxist dialectics in the contemporary era, fully reflecting the essence of the spirit of the times. Its theory involves many aspects, summing up the experience of past revolutionary practices and guiding future revolutionary practices. The theory of the two types of contradictions proposed by Chairman Mao has been proven in practice over the past year and has undergone new developments.

Li Da, in his speech, talked about politics being the commander of economics, saying: Our country first had a socialist superstructure and then a socialist economic base, which is in line with Lenin's principle that "politics takes precedence over economics"; Marxism-Leninism, the Marxist-Leninist party, and the dictatorship of the proletariat constitute the socialist superstructure.

Pan Zinian elaborated on the great significance of Chairman Mao's work for the Marxist theory of the state. He believes that this work has made clear instructions on the question of how the state will wither away. The most important thing is that Chairman Mao divided contradictions into two categories and clearly defined the scope of "the people," clarifying the boundaries between contradictions between ourselves and the enemy and contradictions among the people. It makes us know when to use dictatorship to deal with which contradictions; and when to use democracy to deal with which contradictions. Chairman Mao's work and the new situation brought about after the publication of the work can enable us to correctly understand how the socialist state apparatus withers away and prevent being deceived by revisionism.

Ai Siqi's speech was entitled "How the Contradiction between Relations of Production and Productive Forces is Manifested as Contradictions Among the People." He put forward three points: First, the development of the relations of production and productive forces in our country is basically suitable. The situation of the Great Leap Forward that has emerged since last winter is a situation in which the productive forces and the relations of production are adapted to each other. The Great Leap Forward shows the great superiority of socialist relations of production. Second, affirming that the relations of production and productive forces in our country are suitable does not mean that there are no contradictions. In some aspects of the relations of production, there are still unsuitable aspects. However, this kind of contradiction is non-antagonistic and can be resolved internally in a timely manner. The situation of the Great Leap Forward is not due to the fact that there are no contradictions between the relations of production and the productive forces, but because the contradictions have been resolved. Third, the continuous revelation and resolution of the contradictions between socialist relations of production and productive forces is the driving force for the development of socialist society.

Xu Liqun, in his speech, believed that the theory on the correct handling of contradictions among the people and the theory on the basic contradictions of socialist society are Chairman Mao's creative contributions to Marxist-Leninist theory. Chairman Mao has set the best example of adhering to the dialectical materialist world outlook and bringing into play the subjective initiative of the masses. Xu Liqun used the materials of the rectification and anti-rightist campaign and the production upsurge over the past year to illustrate that the great victory of the rectification movement is proof of the truthfulness of Chairman Mao's policy on the correct handling of contradictions among the people. Without the incomparably high revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses brought about by the victory of the rectification and anti-rightist campaign, the current great production upsurge would not have occurred. He analyzed the importance of resolving the issue of people's status and mutual relations in production in the current relations of production, and also analyzed Chairman Mao's contributions to the theoretical issues of the base and the superstructure, and emphasized that without Chairman Mao's creative theoretical work, the formation of the general line for socialist construction in our country would not have been possible.

Sun Dingguo said that Chairman Mao's work is not only a sharp weapon against dogmatism, but also a sharp weapon against revisionism. In this work, Chairman Mao especially emphasized the role and purpose of the dictatorship of the proletariat, further enriching the Marxist theory of the state. This is of particularly great significance for opposing modern revisionist trends of thought.

Luo Gengmo believed that correctly applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism in practice is creatively developing Marxism-Leninism. He discussed the philosophical significance of the general line from several aspects.

Yu Guangyuan suggested that this academic symposium should implement the spirit of rectification; promote a great leap forward in philosophical work; and that philosophical workers should change the face of philosophical work through hard work, attach importance to reality, and enhance the combat effectiveness of philosophy.

Hou Wailu, Zeng Wenjing, Gao Yu, Zhang Yong, Li Honglin, Huo Ding and others also expressed their opinions at the meeting.

The symposium will be temporarily adjourned from the 4th. After the resumption, while continuing to discuss the great contributions of Chairman Mao's work, it will also launch a critique of the thorough revisionist program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

    毛泽东同志“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”
    是马列主义辩证法在当代的重大发展
    中国哲学会和科学院哲学研究所为纪念这一著作发表一周年举行学术座谈会
    新华社4日讯　中国哲学会和中国科学院哲学研究所为了纪念毛主席“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”发表一周年，2、3两日在北京举行学术座谈会，学习和讨论这部著作。参加座谈会的有北京、上海、武汉、河北、山东等地的哲学、经济学、历史学方面的研究工作者一百八十多人。
    座谈会根据毛主席这一著作中所提出的哲学问题，结合我国当前的革命实践，特别是联系当前全民大跃进的新形势，本着百家争鸣的精神，从各个方面展开了理论上的阐述和讨论。两天来发言的人都认为毛主席的这一著作是马克思主义辩证法在当代的重大发展，它充分反映了时代精神的精华，它的理论牵涉到许多方面，它总结了过去革命实践的经验，又指导着今后的革命实践。毛主席提出的两类矛盾的理论，在这一年来的实践中获得了证明并且有了新的发展。
    李达在发言中谈到政治是经济的统帅时说：我国先有了社会主义的上层建筑然后才有社会主义的经济基础，这是符合于列宁所说的“政治优先于经济”这个原则的；马克思列宁主义、马克思列宁主义的党和无产阶级专政就是社会主义的上层建筑。
    潘梓年阐述了毛主席这一著作对于马克思主义的国家学说的重大意义。他认为这一著作在国家如何消亡这一问题上作出了明确的指示，其中最主要的是毛主席把矛盾划分为两类，并且明确地规定了“人民”的范围，使敌我矛盾、人民内部矛盾的范围划清了界线；使我们知道对待怎样的矛盾要专政；对待怎样的矛盾要民主；毛主席的这一著作和著作发表以后带来的新局面，可以使我们正确理解社会主义国家机器怎样消亡，防止被修正主义蒙混。
    艾思奇发言的题目是“生产关系与生产力的矛盾如何表现为人民内部矛盾”。他提出了三点：一，我们国家生产关系和生产力发展情况基本上是适合的。去年冬季以来出现的大跃进形势，就是生产力和生产关系相适应的形势。大跃进说明了社会主义生产关系有极大的优越性。二，肯定了我国生产关系和生产力适合并不是说没有矛盾，在生产关系的某些环节上，还有不相适应之处。但这种矛盾是非对抗性的，可以及时在内部得到解决。大跃进的形势并不是由于生产关系和生产力没有矛盾，而是由于解决了矛盾。三，社会主义生产关系和生产力的矛盾的不断揭露和解决，是社会主义社会发展的动力。
    许立群在发言中，认为关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的学说，关于社会主义社会的基本矛盾的学说，是毛主席对马列主义理论创造性的贡献。毛主席树立了坚持辩证唯物主义世界观和发挥群众的主观能动性的最好范例。许立群以一年来整风反右派和生产高潮的材料，说明整风运动的伟大胜利，就是毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针真理性的证明。没有整风反右派胜利所带来的群众无比高涨的革命积极性，就不会出现当前伟大的生产高潮。他分析了当前在生产关系方面解决人们在生产中的地位和相互关系问题的重要性，又分析了毛主席对基础和上层建筑理论问题上的贡献，并着重指出，离开了毛主席这些创造性的理论工作，我国社会主义建设总路线的形成，就是不可能的。
    孙定国说，毛主席的这个著作，不仅是反对教条主义的犀利武器，而且也是反对修正主义的犀利武器。毛主席在这个著作中特别着重地阐明了无产阶级专政的作用和目的，进一步地丰富了马克思主义国家学说。这对于反对现代修正主义思潮，具有特别重大的意义。
    骆耕漠认为在实践中正确应用马克思列宁主义原理，就是创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。他从几个侧面论述了总路线的哲学意义。
    于光远建议这次学术座谈会要贯彻整风精神；要促进哲学工作大跃进；哲学工作者要经过苦战，改变哲学工作的面貌，要重视现实，提高哲学的战斗性。
    侯外庐、曾文经、高　禹、张镛、李洪林、霍丁等人都在会上发表了意见。
    座谈会从4日起暂时休会，以后复会在继续讨论毛主席这一著作的重大贡献的同时，还要对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的彻头彻尾的修正主义纲领展开批判。
