    The Chemical Industry with Unlimited Prospects
    ——A Record of the Synthetic Materials Exhibition in Moscow
        By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang
    Upon entering the exhibition hall of the Synthetic Materials Exhibition, you will first be struck by a sense of beauty. The dazzling exhibits, the exquisitely designed pictures and explanations with upward-flying red arrows, seem to transport you to a strange world. In front of each chart and exhibit, you will learn about many new things. Whether it is versatile plastic or wonderful man-made fibers, synthetic rubber, or other chemical industrial products, they all illustrate the close connection between the chemical industry and modern social life. The development of the chemical industry will not only beautify people's lives but also open up a new realm in the entire national economy. For this reason, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union decided to accelerate the development of the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic materials and their products.
    In a large hall of the exhibition, we saw two black suede women's leather coats, identical in style and luster. If the guide hadn't explained that one was made of natural wool and the other of artificial fur, you would have thought they were produced by the same factory. These two leather coats not only had no difference in appearance, but their ability to keep warm was also exactly the same, but the artificial fur product was half the price. On display here were also hats made of artificial fur and coats of various colors and styles made of artificial plush. People watched and still asked the guide in surprise: "Is this man-made?"
    The Soviet Union is a country rich in wool and possesses world-renowned sheep breeds. The annual wool production of the Soviet Union reaches about 300,000 tons, but it still cannot meet the needs of the people. The amount that does not meet the needs of the people will be supplemented by artificial fur in the future. The production of artificial fur in the Soviet Union will increase thirteen times by 1965 compared to now.
    The exhibition has man-made fibers made from pine wood, and dresses and various raincoats made from this man-made fiber. At the same time, you can also see the extremely tough cables and insulated wires made of nylon.
    Plastics have become increasingly important in the lives of the Soviet people. At present, there are more than 2,000 kinds of plastics widely used in production in the Soviet Union, and in many places, plastics have replaced wood. Doors and windows made of plastic are lighter and more beautiful than those made of wood, and walls made of plastic-clad crushed wood, although only sixteen centimeters thick, can keep warm and soundproof, and this kind of wall does not need wallpaper, and after it gets dirty, it can be brushed with water like a new one. A Soviet chemical plant has designed a toilet made of plastic, which weighs only 650 kilograms, while one built with concrete weighs 5 tons.
    Soviet chemists have created new types of plastics that are cold-resistant, heat-resistant, acid-resistant, alkali-resistant, and fire-resistant. There is a fluorine-containing plastic on display at the exhibition that can withstand temperatures of minus 70 degrees Celsius and plus 250 degrees Celsius without any changes. The windshield in front of a supersonic aircraft is made of it. In addition, the Soviet Union has now produced the first batch of car bodies made of plastic. If the front car body of the "Moskvich" car is made of plastic, it will only weigh 12 kilograms.
    In an exhibition room, we saw a group of medical students listening very carefully to the guide's explanation. It turned out that medical equipment made of plastic was on display here, including transparent tools for doctors to perform surgery. The use of such tools in surgery does not interfere with the doctor's line of sight, and at the same time, a small light bulb is installed inside the handle of each tool. After turning on the button, the entire tool glows and is transparent.
    The task put forward by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is to increase plastic production eightfold by 1965. It is fully possible to complete this task in the Soviet Union. There are abundant natural gas in Baku and other industrial areas, and by-products produced from the petroleum processing industry, from which the raw material for manufacturing plastic - polyethylene - can be obtained.
    Among the exhibits of synthetic rubber, the huge black tire is very eye-catching. This tire is made of synthetic rubber. The production of synthetic rubber in the Soviet Union has developed considerably in recent years, and the production volume in 1957 increased by 312% compared with 1940. By 1965, the output of synthetic rubber will be 2.4 times higher than in 1957. Here we also saw a tubeless tire. The guide said that the test proved that this tire has the same effect as an ordinary tire with a tube, and the advantage is that the car factory can eliminate the production of inner tubes and can guarantee driving safety.
    At the exit of the exhibition, we saw many people walking to the suggestion book to write down their impressions and opinions. Almost everyone expressed their support for the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. People said that this exhibition not only showed them the importance and broad development prospects of the chemical industry but also its close relationship with improving their lives.

### 前途无限的化学工业——记莫斯科的合成物质展览会

    前途无限的化学工业
    ——记莫斯科的合成物质展览会
        本报记者　崔永昌
    走进了合成物质展览会的展览室后，首先你会产生一种美的感觉。那五光十色的展览品，那设计精美的图片和说明上一个个飞扬向上的红箭头，好像把你带到了一个奇异的世界。在每一张图表和每一件展览品面前，你会了解到许多新的问题。不管是万能的塑料，还是奇妙的人造纤维；不管是合成橡胶，还是其他的化学工业产品，都说明了化学工业与现代社会生活的密切联系。化学工业的发展不但会美化人们的生活，并且会在整个国民经济中开辟出一个新的境界。正因为如此，所以苏共中央五月全会决定加速发展化学工业，特别是合成物质及其制品的生产。
    在展览会的一个大厅里，我们看到了两件黑色的翻毛女皮大衣，式样、光泽完全一样，如果不是解说员说明一件是天然羊毛，一件是人造毛做成的，你一定以为它们是一个工厂的出品呢。这两件皮大衣不但外表没有区别，而且保暖的能力也完全一样，但是人造毛的产品在价格上却便宜一半。在这里展出的还有人造毛制成的帽子和各种颜色各种式样的人造长毛绒大衣。人们一面观赏，一面还在惊疑地问解说员：“这是人造的吗？”
    苏联是个盛产羊毛的国家，而且拥有世界闻名的羊种。苏联每年羊毛产量达三十万吨左右，但是仍然满足不了人民的需要。这个不敷人民需要的数额，今后将由人造毛来补足。苏联人造毛的生产到1965年时将比现在提高十三倍。
    展览会上有用松木作原料制成的人造纤维，有用这种人造纤维制成的连衣裙和各式雨衣。同时还可以看见那坚韧无比的用尼龙制成的电缆和绝缘线。
    塑料在苏联人民生活中的地位已愈来愈重要了。目前苏联在生产上广泛应用的塑料已经有两千多种，在许多地方塑料已经代替了木材。用塑料制成的门窗比木制的既轻便又美观，用塑料夹碎木制成的墙壁虽然只有十六公分厚，但是它却能保暖、隔音，并且这种墙壁不需要糊墙纸，脏了以后用水一刷，就像新的一样。苏联一家化学工厂设计出了一种用塑料制成的盥洗间，它的重量只有六百五十公斤，用混凝土建造的则重达五吨。
    苏联化学家已经制成了耐寒、耐热、不怕酸碱、不怕火烧的新型塑料。展览会上有一种含氟的塑料，它在摄氏零下七十度和零上二百五十度的情况下可以不发生任何变化。超音速飞机前面的挡风板就是用它做成的。此外，现在苏联已经制成了第一批用塑料制成的汽车车身，“莫斯科人”小轿车的前部车身如果用塑料制造，将只有十二公斤重。
    在一个展览室里我们看见一群医学院的学生非常注意地倾听着解说员的说明，原来这里展出的是用塑料制成的医疗用具。其中有医生作手术用的透明工具。在动手术时用这种工具可以不妨碍医生的视线，同时在每个用具的把柄内部都装有一个小电灯，打开电钮以后，整个工具发亮透明。
    苏共中央提出的任务是到1965年把塑料生产提高八倍。完成这项任务在苏联是有充分可能的，在巴库和其他一些工业区有丰富的天然气和从石油加工业中生产的副产品，从这些物质里全可以得到制造塑料的原料——聚乙烯。
    在合成橡胶的展览品中，巨大的黑色轮带很引人注意。这种轮带是用合成橡胶制成的。苏联合成橡胶的生产近年来有了相当的发展，1957年的生产量比1940年提高了312％。到1965年时，合成橡胶的产量要比1957年提高两点四倍。在这里我们还看到了一种不用内胎的轮带，解说员说，试验证明这种轮带与普通带内胎的轮带效果完全一样，而优点是汽车厂内可以取消制造内胎的生产，并且可以保证行车的安全。
    在展览会的出口处，我们看到许多人走到意见簿旁边去写下自己的印象和意见。几乎每个人都表示了他们对苏共中央五月全会决议的支持。人们说，这次展览使他们不仅看到了化学工业的重要性和广阔的发展前途，而且也看到了它同改善自己生活的密切关系。（附图片）
