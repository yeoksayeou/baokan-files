    "A Newborn Calf Isn't Afraid of the Tiger"
    Zeng Zhi

    In the past, whenever young people did things that older people considered to be overstepping the rules, or beyond their capabilities, or said things that were not so "well-behaved," some older people would sigh and say: Young people, they fear neither heaven nor earth, they are truly "newborn calves unafraid of tigers."

    Comparing young people to "newborn calves unafraid of tigers" has two completely different meanings. One is that young people are like newborn calves, ignorant and reckless, not even knowing to fear fierce tigers. The other is that young people are not afraid of any difficulties, not even tigers. I agree with the latter interpretation. Young people should have the spirit of not being afraid of any difficulties, not even tigers. Only with this spirit can they be selfless, dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and go forward courageously. There are many such people. Not to mention the distant past, in the newspapers of the last few days, they can be found almost every day.

    The May 15th issue of the China Youth Daily reported on the process of Cao Wentao, a rural youth who had only attended junior high school, creating the "Eight-Purpose Processing Machine." After reading this report, who could not be encouraged by Cao Wentao's spirit of daring to think and daring to act? Who could not be moved by his spirit of humbly learning and studying diligently? Who could not be inspired by his firm and indomitable determination and perseverance in conquering difficulties? To explore Cao Wentao's inner world, we might as well see how he himself answered those who advised him "don't be a wild cat trying to eat swan meat." When he was first trying to make a water-lifting machine, someone advised him: "No one has ever made such a thing from ancient times to the present, can you make it? Don't be a wild cat trying to eat swan meat, wasting your efforts." Cao Wentao replied: "If we only do things that others have already done, then no new things will be created in the world, and the whole world will not be able to progress!" Others believed that invention and creation should be done by people who have gone to university, not by mud-legged peasants. But he was full of ambition, believing that mud-legged peasants can also do it, and that he can do what others can do, because there is the leadership and support of the Party, and his own efforts.

    Let's also look at the example of the twenty-two-year-old girl Zhu Guoyun surpassing the old farmer Chen Daoyin (see page 4 of the May 16th People's Daily). Chen Daoyin is an old technician of the Sanhe Cooperative in Gucheng County, Hubei Province, an "old hand" in production, who has always looked down on Zhu Guoyun, a girl, relying on his rich experience. Even though Zhu Guoyun is the director and Party branch secretary of the Sanhe Cooperative, Chen Daoyin opposed whatever Zhu Guoyun advocated. Last autumn, when Zhu Guoyun returned from a meeting in the county and mobilized everyone to discuss catching up with the Gaoshe Cooperative, which had good soil and a good work foundation, he kept opposing it. Zhu Guoyun and her comrades chose the worst soil and the lowest-yielding hill in the cooperative to conduct wheat high-yield experiments. They used close planting, strip sowing, and a series of new yield-increasing measures. Chen Daoyin insisted on choosing a piece of land and, according to his many years of experience, conducted a sparse planting experiment field to compete with Zhu Guoyun and the others. As a result, Zhu Guoyun and other young people without experience actually beat him, the experienced old farmer.

    After reading the reports about Cao Wentao and Zhu Guoyun, one cannot help but think of what Chairman Mao said to young people, "The world belongs to you." Since the "world" belongs to young people, young people certainly have the responsibility to make it better. To make it better, we must dare to create. Otherwise, as Cao Wentao said, "there will be no new things in the world." It is precisely this kind of thinking that encourages young people to dare to speak, dare to think, and dare to act. In order to realize their ideals, young people can put their personal success or failure aside and go forward courageously, never looking back.

    I hope all young people can have this style!

    “初生犊儿不怕虎”
    曾志
    过去，每当青年人做出了在老年人看来是逾越了规矩，或者是力不胜任的事情，或者是说了些不那么“安份守己”的话时，就会听到一些老年人慨叹地说：青年人哪，天不怕地不怕，真是“初生犊儿不怕虎”。
    把青年人比做“初生犊儿不怕虎”，有两种完全不同的意思，一种是说青年人好像初生的牛犊一样，懞懞憧憧，冒冒失失，连凶恶的老虎都不知道害怕；一种是说青年人不怕一切困难，连老虎都不怕。我赞成后一种解释，青年人就应该具有不怕一切困难，连老虎都不怕的精神，只有有了这种精神，才能奋不顾身，敢想敢说敢作，一往直前。这样的人是不少的，远的不说，在最近几天的报纸上，几乎可以天天找到。
    5月15日的中国青年报上，报道了仅仅读过初小的农村青年曹文韬创造“八用加工机”的经过。读了这个报道，谁能不为曹文韬的敢想敢做的精神所鼓舞？谁能不为他虚心学习、苦学苦钻的精神所感动？为他的坚决顽强、征服困难的决心和毅力所激发呢？要探视曹文韬的内心世界，不妨看看他自己是怎样回答那些劝他“不要野猫子想吃天鹅肉”的人的吧。当他第一次试制升水机的时候，有人劝他说：“从古到今，都没有人搞出来的东西，你搞得出吗？不要野猫子想吃天鹅肉，枉费心机”。曹文韬回答说：“如果都要是别人搞过的东西才搞，那末世界上再不会有新的东西创造出来了，整个世界也就不能再进步了！”别人认为搞发明创造要进过大学的人才行，不是泥巴佬做得成的事。他却满怀壮志地认为：泥巴佬也可以搞得成，别人能够做得到的事，他也能够做得到，因为有党的领导和支持，还有自己的努力。
    再看看二十二岁的姑娘朱国蕴赛过老农陈道银的事例吧（见5月16日人民日报四版）。陈道银是湖北谷城县三合社的老技术员，是个生产的“老把式”，一向凭着自己经验丰富，瞧不起朱国蕴这么个女孩子。尽管朱国蕴是三合社的主任、党支部书记。每次不管朱国蕴提倡什么，陈道银都要反对。去年秋天，当朱国蕴从县里开会回来，发动大家讨论了要赶上土质好、工作基础好的高产社共同社后，他就一个劲儿反对。朱国蕴和她的战友选择了社里土质最坏、产量最低的岗地进行小麦高产试验，他们搞密植、条播，还有一系列的新的增产措施；陈道银偏偏选了一块地，按照他多年的经验，搞了一个稀植试验田，和朱国蕴他们比高低。比赛结果，没有经验的朱国蕴等年青人，竟把他这个经验丰富的老农比了下去。
    看了曹文韬、朱国蕴的报道，不能不使人想起毛主席对青年人说的“世界是属于你们的”这句话。“世界”既然是属于青年人的，青年人当然有责任把它搞得更好。要搞得更好，就要敢于创造。否则，就会像曹文韬说的，“世界上没有新的东西”。也正是这种思想，鼓励青年人敢说敢想敢作，为了实现自己的理想，青年人可以把个人的成败置之度外，一往直前，绝不返顾。
    但愿所有的青年人都能具有这种风格！
