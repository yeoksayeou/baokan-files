　　No Interference in Indonesia
    Recently, as the Central Sumatra rebel group has suffered a shameful defeat, the United States' interference and aggression against Indonesia has become increasingly blatant. This despicable behavior of the U.S. imperialists, disregarding international law and flagrantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, has aroused our great anger. We warmly support the statements issued by the Chinese and Soviet governments on the 14th and 15th respectively, protesting against U.S. interference in Indonesia, and are determined to work to defend peace in the Far East and the world, and to stop U.S. interference in Indonesia.
    We believe that the crime of U.S. interference in Indonesia cannot be denied. The United States disregards the solemn UN Charter, violates the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, and infringes upon the sovereignty of other countries. According to the principles solemnly declared by the Asian-African Lawyers Conference, the United States has committed not only one but several acts of aggression against Indonesia. For example, U.S. planes bombing ships on the Indonesian seas, the U.S. supplying weapons and money to the rebels, and the U.S. plotting and instigating rebellion through its agents are all serious infringements on Indonesia's independent sovereignty. Therefore, the crimes of the U.S. imperialists are obvious and undeniable.
    We warn the U.S. imperialists: the Indonesian people are not to be insulted! The will of the peace-loving people of the world is not to be insulted! If the United States does not stop its interference activities, it will suffer an even more shameful defeat. Final victory belongs to the Indonesian people.

　　不许干涉印度尼西亚
    最近以来，随着中苏门答腊叛乱集团遭到可耻失败，美国对印度尼西亚的干涉和侵略活动也越来越明目张胆了。美帝国主义者这种不顾国际公法、蛮横地干涉他国内政的卑鄙行为，激起了我们极大的愤怒。我们热烈拥护中苏两国政府在14日和15日分别发表的抗议美国干涉印度尼西亚的声明，决心为保卫远东和世界和平、为制止美国对印度尼西亚的干涉而努力。
    我们认为，美国干涉印度尼西亚的罪行，是抵赖不了的。美国无视庄严的联合国宪章，违反了不干涉他国内政的原则，侵犯了别国的主权。根据亚非法律工作者会议庄严宣布过的原则，美国对印度尼西亚不仅犯了一种而且犯了几种侵略罪行。例如：美国飞机轰炸印度尼西亚海面的船只，美国用武器和金钱供给叛乱分子，美国阴谋策动并通过其代理人煽动叛乱等等，都是对印度尼西亚独立主权的严重侵犯。因此，美帝国主义者的罪行，是昭然若揭，无可狡辩的。
    我们警告美帝国主义者：印度尼西亚人民不可侮！世界爱好和平人民的意志不可侮！美国如果不停止它的干涉活动，一定要遭到更加可耻的失败。最后胜利是属于印度尼西亚人民的。
