    The Communist Party is the Decisive Weapon of the Working Class (Abstract)
    Soviet Union, Ponomarev

    The Soviet "Pravda" recently published an article by Ponomarev entitled "The Communist Party is the Decisive Weapon of the Working Class."

    The article stated: "The world communist movement has entered a new stage of development. This stage is characterized by the growing role of communist and workers' parties in determining the destiny of mankind, in realizing the ideals of peace, democracy, and socialism.

    "The declaration of the Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of Socialist Countries, this outstanding document of creative Marxism-Leninism, has been unanimously approved not only by the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries that adopted it, but also by the fraternal parties of capitalist countries. This declaration has become a document of the entire international communist movement. The six months since the Moscow meeting have clearly demonstrated to the world that the communist and workers' parties, the entire world communist movement, are united on the basis of the ideas of the two declarations. At the present stage, it is impossible for Marxist-Leninist parties to formulate any programmatic documents without taking the principles of the Moscow Declaration as a basis. There is no justification for opposing the ideas of the Moscow Declaration. The entire international communist movement is fighting extremely intensely and heroically against the imperialist reactionaries for the future of mankind, for peace and socialism, according to the ideas of the declaration.

    "All the forces of the old world—the world of exploitation and oppression—are waging a cruel and stubborn struggle against socialist ideology. The spearhead of this struggle is directed against the communist and workers' parties. The ideological unity and organizational solidarity of the communist and workers' parties are an indestructible great wall. All anti-communist offensives of reactionary forces have been smashed against this wall in the past, and they will inevitably be smashed in the future."

    When discussing the role of the Party, the article stated: "Lenin's doctrine on the new type of party, on its role and significance, has been confirmed by the entire course of historical events. Without the leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties, the struggle of the people of the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries for socialism could not have achieved a victory of world-historical significance. "In socialist countries, great communist and workers' parties closely linked with the people have grown up. They are the leading force in socialist countries and are the organizers and inspirers of building a new life. They bear historical responsibility for the fate of the world socialist system." "The characteristic of all anti-socialist elements is to infringe upon the leading role of the Communist Party, and to try their best to destroy the ideological fortress of Marxism-Leninism and the organizational solidarity of the Communist Party ranks. The Communist and Workers' Parties consider their primary responsibility to be to constantly strengthen their ranks and enhance the prestige and role of the Communist and Workers' Parties in the struggle for socialism."

    "The Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries are implementing important measures aimed at strengthening their ranks and expanding their ties with the masses."

    The article pointed out the importance of strengthening the socialist camp and educating the working people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and in the spirit of combining internationalism and patriotism. The article stated: "In the struggle for peace and socialism, every communist party can fulfill its mission to the working class and all working people of its own country, as well as to the international workers' movement. But there is one condition, that is, it must make a clear Marxist-Leninist answer to the following fundamental questions: what is the comparison of class forces on the international stage; where does the danger of war come from; who is the pillar of all reactionary forces and who is the main enemy of socialism. Any ambiguity on these questions, any confusion of the two camps, the world socialist system and the world capitalist system, can only bring great harm."

    The article continued: "The vitality and great strength of the Leninist doctrine on the Party are also confirmed by the experience of the activities of communist parties in capitalist countries.

    "Although the communist parties in capitalist countries work under difficult conditions and are constantly subjected to the frantic persecution of imperialist reactionaries, they are moving forward firmly, constantly expanding their ranks and their influence among the masses."

    "Life has overturned the so-called 'crisis-free development of capitalism,' 'prosperity,' 'harmonization of class interests,' and other 'theories' spread by bourgeois ideologists and revisionists in recent years. Now no one can deny the fact that economic crises have begun in some major capitalist countries. In this situation, monopoly capital is beginning to attack the living standards, democratic rights, and social achievements of the working class. Many facts prove that the aggressive blocs of Western countries are stepping up preparations for a devastating war using thermonuclear weapons.

    "The working class and its communist vanguard in capitalist countries bear a historical mission: to unite all forces against the destructive policies of the monopoly bourgeoisie, to defend the vital interests of the working people, to smash the atomic war preparation plans, and to consolidate the cause of peace. The working class in capitalist countries, under the leadership of the Communist Party, is capable of accomplishing this task. The communist parties in capitalist countries are constantly calling on the working class to act in concert and calling on all healthy forces of their own people to unite."

    "Many communist parties in capitalist countries have become mass parties, and they lead the broad strata of the working class."

    "The enemies of the working class clearly know the strength of the Communist Party. They are trying to strangle the communist movement and isolate the Communist Party from the masses. After the war, the ruling groups of capitalist countries launched a terrifying military police and propaganda machine to deal with the Communist Party."

    "The reactionaries launched particularly fierce attacks on the American Communist Party, and in order to achieve this goal, they used revisionists who attempted to disintegrate the Party from within."

    "Now some people are talking loudly about how it is not the Party, but the trade union, that leads the struggle for socialist interests. This statement is a stab in the back to the American Communist Party, which is fighting against American imperialism under difficult conditions.

    "In the vortex of class struggle, the Communist Party has been tempered and has become a stronger defender of the interests of the working class. Despite the dozens of anti-communist movements launched by imperialist blocs, they have not been able to eliminate the Communist Party. All this demonstrates the great vitality of the Communist Party and that it is deeply rooted among the working class. The working class protects its vanguard from persecution and strengthens the Party ranks with its best representatives.

    "The communist parties of capitalist countries are currently in a period of strengthening and consolidating their ranks. In order to be competent for the current tasks, the Communist Party is trying to improve its ideological and organizational work."

    When discussing defending the purity of Marxist-Leninist theory, the article stated: "In the current situation, the main danger of the communist movement is revisionism, because it spreads bourgeois ideology to the working class. This ideology paralyzes the revolutionary will of the working class and serves the goals of the enemies of socialism. Revisionism attempts to undermine the influence of the Communist Party's strength, to 'revise' what constitutes the main strength of the working-class party, and the Leninist principles. The characteristic of all revisionists who have recently appeared in the Communist Party ranks is their opposition to the foundation of Marxist-Leninist theory on the Party, and their opposition to the tested Leninist principles of Party building."

    On these issues of Party building, revisionism is first manifested in attacking the Leninist principles of Party building, and attacking the leading role of the Party in the workers' movement.

    "Revisionists deny the necessity of the guiding and leading role of the Communist Party in the period of building socialism in the people's democratic countries. Revisionists belittle the role of the Communist Party in the entire socialist construction. They insist that the working-class party should only play the role of a political education organization."

    "Revisionists advocate weakening the discipline of the Communist Parties of socialist countries and advocate freedom of sectarian and factional activities. It is not difficult to see that here they are also playing the role of accomplices for anti-socialist forces and international imperialism.

    "In the communist parties of capitalist countries, right-wing opportunists deny the necessity of a strong Communist Party, bound by iron discipline, united on the basis of Marxist-Leninist ideology, and not allowing the establishment of sects and factions in its ranks." Among the right-wing revisionist groups, some even "openly clamor for dissolving the Communist Party and turning it into various non-Party 'political activity associations.' They insist that the working class currently has no task of revolutionary struggle, and attempt to use this argument to 'demonstrate' their liquidationist views. However, everyone has long known that liquidationism is nothing but support for the bourgeois system and a blatant betrayal of the cause of the working class."

    The article stated: "The syndicalist views that have long been smashed by Marxism-Leninism have been resurrected. Its advocates assert that under the new conditions (this word is widely used by those who are simply smuggling in junk), in countries with few communists, the working masses will increasingly participate in the process of strengthening conscious socialist forces through trade unions, and participate in the process of fighting for strengthening the social influence of the working class and for the leading role of the working class in the political system.

    "Lenin thoroughly destroyed this argument in his book 'What Is To Be Done?' Those who advocate that the working class can seize power through trade unions are intentionally or unintentionally confusing the working class in capitalist countries. Marxist-Leninists attach great importance to the activities of trade unions. However, without the Communist Party, trade unions cannot realize the socialist goals of the working class."

    The article continued: "In those countries where the Communist Party has few members and there are numerous Social Democratic parties in opposition to it, some representatives of revisionism propose merging the Communist Party into the Social Democratic Party. In other words, they want to return the Party to the old state that has proven unable to fight for socialism and unable to defend the interests of the working class. In fact, this capitulationist suggestion means that the workers' movement will regress an entire historical era and return to the nineteenth century.

    "Others, although they do not demand merging with the Social Democratic Party, attempt to erase the boundaries between the Communist Party and other parties and movements that also claim to take the socialist path. This argument can only bring great harm to the cause of the working class, because it actually dissolves the vanguard Communist Party of the working class into political factions that are contrary to Marxism-Leninism, thereby causing the proletariat to lose its advanced troops.

    "However, most modern revisionists do not openly oppose the existence of the Communist Party, and do not loudly call for dissolving the Party into other factions or parties. These more concealed revisionists attempt to revise the principles of Party building, political and organizational activities of the Marxist-Leninist Party under the guise of 'democratization'. They first attack the principle of democratic centralism. The revisionists shout that the principle of democratic centralism is 'outdated', that 'it narrows the scope of the Party', 'restricts freedom of speech', and so on.

    "The revisionists were resolutely rebuffed by the Communist Party. The political evolution of modern revisionists convincingly shows who they are serving."

    The article concluded: "The interests of the working class and the working masses urgently require resolutely overcoming revisionism, and requiring doing everything possible to consolidate the Communist Party ideologically and organizationally. This is the most important condition for the working class to fight for peace, democratic freedom and national independence, and for the socialist goals of the working class."

    共产党是工人阶级的决定性的武器（摘要）
    苏联　波诺马烈夫
    苏联“真理报”最近刊载了波诺马烈夫写的题为“共产党是工人阶级的决定性的武器”的文章。
    文章说：“世界共产主义运动已经进入了新的发展阶段。这一阶段的特点是共产党和工人党在决定人类命运、在实现和平、民主和社会主义理想方面的作用增长了。
    “社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言这一创造性的马克思列宁主义的卓越文件不仅得到了通过它的社会主义国家共产党和工人党的一致赞同，而且也得到了资本主义国家兄弟党的赞同。这个宣言已经成为整个国际共产主义运动的文件。莫斯科会议以后的半年向全世界清楚地表明，共产党和工人党、整个世界共产主义运动在两个宣言思想的基础上团结起来了。在现阶段，如果不拿莫斯科宣言的原理作为基础，马克思列宁主义政党就不可能制定出任何纲领性的文件。反对莫斯科宣言的思想是没有任何理由的。整个国际共产主义运动都在根据宣言的思想为人类的未来，为和平和社会主义而同帝国主义反动派进行极其紧张而英勇的斗争。
    “旧世界——剥削和压迫的世界——的一切力量正在进行着残酷的顽固的斗争来反对社会主义思想。这一斗争的矛头指向共产党和工人党。“共产党和工人党思想上的一致和组织上的团结是一堵不可摧毁的巨墙，反动势力的一切反共进攻过去在这道墙上撞得粉碎，将来也必定撞得粉碎。”
    文章在谈到党的作用时说：“列宁关于新型政党、关于它的作用和意义的学说被整个历史事件的进程证实了。如果没有马克思列宁主义政党的领导，苏联人民，中国和其他社会主义国家的劳动人民争取社会主义的斗争就不可能获得具有世界历史意义的胜利。“在社会主义国家，同人民有紧密联系的伟大的共产党和工人党成长起来了。它们是社会主义国家的领导力量，是建设新生活的组织者和鼓舞者。它们对世界社会主义体系的命运负有历史责任。”“一切反社会主义分子的特点都是想侵害共产党的领导作用，极力想摧毁马克思列宁主义的思想堡垒和共产党队伍的组织团结。“共产党和工人党认为它的首要职责，是不断地加强自己的队伍，提高共产党和工人党在争取社会主义的斗争中的威信和作用。”
    “社会主义国家共产党和工人党正在实行旨在加强自己的队伍和扩大同人民群众联系的重要措施。”
    文章指出了加强社会主义阵营和用马克思列宁主义精神、用国际主义与爱国主义相结合的精神教育劳动人民的重要性。文章说：“在争取和平和社会主义的斗争中，每个共产党无论是对本国的工人阶级和全体劳动人民以及对国际工人运动都可以实现自己的使命。但是要有一个条件，即它必须对下列根本问题作出明确的马克思列宁主义的回答：国际舞台上阶级力量的对比如何；战争的危险来自何方；谁是一切反动势力的支柱，谁是社会主义主要敌人。对这些问题的任何模糊不清，对两个阵营、对社会主义世界体系和资本主义世界体系的任何混淆都只能带来极大的害处。”
    文章继续说：“列宁主义关于党的学说的生命力和伟大力量也为资本主义国家共产党的活动经验所证实。
    “资本主义国家共产党虽然在艰苦的条件下进行工作，不断遭到帝国主义反动势力的疯狂迫害，它们坚定地前进着，不断扩大自己的队伍和它们在群众中的影响。”
    “生活推翻了近几年来资产阶级思想家和修正主义者散布的所谓‘资本主义无危机发展’、‘繁荣’、‘阶级利益调和’等等‘理论’。现在谁也不能否认这样的事实：一些主要资本主义国家都开始了经济危机。在这种情况下，垄断资本开始向工人阶级的生活水平、民主权利和社会成果进攻。许多事实证明，西方国家侵略集团正在加紧准备使用热核武器的毁灭性战争。
    “资本主义国家的工人阶级及其共产党先锋队担负着历史使命：团结一切反对垄断资产阶级毁灭政策的力量，捍卫劳动人民的切身利益，粉碎原子备战计划，巩固和平事业。资本主义国家的工人阶级在共产党的领导下能够完成这项任务，资本主义国家共产党不断号召工人阶级一致行动和号召本国人民一切健康力量团结起来。”
    “资本主义国家的许多共产党已经变成了群众性的党，它们领导着工人阶级的广泛阶层。”
    “工人阶级的敌人清楚地知道共产党的力量。他们力图扼杀共产主义运动，使共产党脱离群众。战后，资本主义国家的统治集团开动了骇人听闻的军事警察和宣传机器来对付共产党。”
    “反动派对美国共产党进行特别猛烈的攻击，为了达到这种目的，他们利用了企图从内部瓦解党的修正主义分子。”
    “现在有人高谈阔论说，不是党、而是工会领导着争取社会主义利益的斗争，这种说法是从背后打击在艰苦条件下进行反对美帝国主义斗争的美国共产党。
    “在阶级战斗的漩涡中，共产党受到了锻炼，成为工人阶级利益更坚强的保卫者。尽管帝国主义集团发动了几十次的反共运动，他们还是无法消灭共产党。这一切都说明了共产党的伟大生命力，说明它在工人阶级中间深深扎根。工人阶级保护自己的先锋队使它不受迫害，并以自己最优秀的代表来加强党的队伍。
    “资本主义国家的共产党目前正处在壮大和巩固自己队伍的时期。为了胜任当前的任务，共产党正设法改进自己的思想工作和组织工作。”
    文章在谈到保卫马克思列宁主义理论的纯洁性时说：“在当前情况下，共产主义运动的主要危险是修正主义，因为它向工人阶级散布资产阶级的意识形态，这种意识形态瘫痪工人阶级的革命意志，并为社会主义的敌人的目标效劳。修正主义企图破坏共产党的力量的影响，‘修改’构成工人阶级政党主要力量的东西以及列宁主义原则。共产党队伍中近来所出现的一切修正主义者的特点，是反对马克思列宁主义关于政党的学说的基础，是反对经过考验的、列宁主义的关于党的建设的原则。”
    在党的建设这些问题上，修正主义首先表现在攻击党的建设的列宁主义原则，攻击党在工人运动中的领导作用。
    “修正主义者否认在人民民主国家建设社会主义时期共产党的指导作用和领导作用的必要性。修正主义者贬低共产党在整个社会主义建设中的作用，他们硬说，工人阶级的政党只应当起政治教育组织的作用。”
    “修正主义者主张削弱社会主义国家共产党的纪律、主张宗派和小集团活动的自由。不难看出，就是在这里他们也是给反社会主义势力和国际帝国主义为虎作伥。
    “在资本主义国家共产党内右倾机会主义者否认坚强的、由铁的纪律联结起来的、在马克思列宁主义思想基础上团结起来的、不允许在自己队伍中建立宗派和小集团的共产党的必要性。”在右派修正主义集团中，有些人甚至“公开叫嚷解散共产党，把它变成各式各样的非党的‘政治活动协会’。他们硬说，目前工人阶级没有革命斗争任务，企图用这种论点来‘论证’自己的取消主义观点。但是，大家早已知道，取消主义不是别的，而是对资产阶级制度的支持，是对工人阶级事业赤裸裸的叛变。”
    文章说：“早已被马克思列宁主义粉碎了的工团主义观点借尸还魂了。它的鼓吹者们断言，在新的条件（这个字眼被那些一味偷运破烂货的人广泛运用）下，在共产党员不多的国家内，劳动群众将通过工会越来越多地参加增强有觉悟的社会主义力量的过程，参加为争取加强工人阶级的社会影响和争取工人阶级在政权系统中的领导作用而斗争的过程。
    “列宁在‘做什么’这本著作里面彻底地击毁了这个论点。鼓吹工人阶级可以通过工会取得政权的人就是在有意无意地迷惑资本主义国家的工人阶级。马克思列宁主义者十分重视工会的活动。但是，没有共产党工会是不能实现工人阶级的社会主义目标的。”
    文章接着说：“在那些共产党党员不多、而却有人数很多的社会民主党与之相对立的国家内，某些修正主义的代表人物便提议把共产党并入社会民主党。换言之，他们想使党回复到那种已经证明不能为社会主义而斗争、不能保卫工人阶级利益的老样子。实际上这种投降主义的建议就意味着要工人运动后退一个整个的历史时代，使它回到十九世纪去。
    “另外一些人，虽然不要求同社会民主党合并，但却企图抹杀共产党同其他各种也扬言要走社会主义道路的政党和运动之间的界线。这种论点只能给工人阶级事业带来极大的危害，因为它实际上使工人阶级的先锋队共产党溶化到与马克思列宁主义相违背的政治派别之中，从而就使无产阶级失去它的先进部队。
    “但是，大多数的现代修正主义者并不公开反对共产党的存在，并不大声疾呼要把党溶化到其他派别或政党中去。这些更加隐蔽的修正主义者企图在‘民主化’的幌子下来修改马克思列宁主义政党的党的建设、政治和组织活动的原则。他们首先攻击民主集中制的原则。修正主义者们大喊大叫说，民主集中制的原则‘过时了’，‘它缩小了党的范围’、‘限制言论自由’等等。
    “修正主义者遭到了共产党的坚决反击。现代修正主义者的政治演进过程令人信服地表明了他们在为谁服务。”
    文章最后说：“工人阶级和劳动群众的利益迫切地要求坚决克服修正主义，要求尽一切办法从思想上和组织上巩固共产党。这是工人阶级为和平、民主自由和民族独立、为工人阶级的社会主义目标而斗争的最重要的条件。”
