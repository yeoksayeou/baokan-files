    Argentina is the second largest country in Latin America, with an area of 2.8 million square kilometers and a population of 20 million. It is an agricultural and pastoral country, and the export of agricultural and pastoral products provides Argentina with approximately 95% of its total foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, Argentina is also one of the most industrialized countries in Latin America.
    Argentina was originally the most important base for British capital in Latin America, but after World War II, American investment and commercial power in Argentina grew, crowding out Britain and taking a dominant position in foreign capital.
    From 1946 to 1955, Argentina was under the rule of the Perón dictatorship. After 1953, Argentina's economy became increasingly difficult, and the Perón government tried to find a way out by relying on the United States, granting the oil exploitation rights of large tracts of land to Mobil Oil Corporation. This measure was opposed by the people of the whole country. The army and navy took the opportunity to stage a coup, overthrowing the Perón government in September 1955 and forming a temporary government organized by the military.
    Since Perón's party was dissolved in October 1955, the traditional "Radical Civic Union" of Argentina has become the largest party in Argentina. This party is a political party of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, and most of the party's members have anti-imperialist and democratic demands. In early 1957, the party split, with the right-wing group within the party forming the "People's Radical Civic Union," and the left-wing, led by party chairman Frondizi, forming the "Intransigent Radical Civic Union."
    Soon, the Argentine interim government announced that presidential, congressional, and local government elections would be held on February 23 of this year. During the campaign, various parties nominated thirteen candidates, but in reality, it was a competition between the two Radical Civic Unions mentioned above. Frondizi's campaign platform included: defending national resources; developing national industry; implementing land reform; expanding foreign trade; opposing military blocs; implementing a foreign policy of peaceful coexistence and establishing friendly relations with all countries in the world. He received the support of the Argentine Communist Party and other patriotic and democratic forces. As a result, Frondizi defeated the candidate of the interim government and the right-wing-supported People's Radical Civic Union by a margin of two to one and was elected president. His party also won all forty-six seats in the Senate, one hundred thirty-three of the one hundred eighty-seven seats in the House of Representatives, and the positions of all twenty-two provincial governors. The Argentine Communist Party's newspaper, "Our Word," commented on the election with the headline "Great Victory of the Argentine People," saying that the defeat of the People's Radical Civic Union in the election was a defeat for the pro-imperialist reactionary forces. The people voted for Frondizi in the hope that the Argentine political situation would develop in the direction of national independence, democracy, the welfare of the people in urban and rural areas, and peace. The Argentine Communist Party also pointed out that the reactionary forces will not be reconciled to defeat, so democratic and people's forces should strengthen unity to defeat their conspiracies and ensure that Argentina advances on the road of peace and democracy.
    Since being elected, Frondizi has repeatedly reiterated that Argentina will maintain friendly relations with all countries. He has called on Latin American countries to implement economic policies that protect the common interests of all countries, enable Latin American countries to achieve independent economic development, and establish trade relations with socialist countries to expand the market for Latin American commodities.
    Argentina has diplomatic relations with six socialist countries: the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria, which is the largest number of countries in Latin America that have diplomatic relations with the socialist bloc. The German Democratic Republic also has a commercial delegation stationed in Argentina. In 1954, trade between Argentina and the socialist bloc accounted for 10% of its total trade, but now it is less than 5%. In January of this year, an official Argentine commercial delegation visited six socialist countries and signed fifty-nine trade contracts with a total value of 27 million US dollars. Its trade with other socialist countries has also developed.
    Due to the manipulation of American imperialism, Argentina maintains diplomatic relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In November of last year, the Argentine interim government appointed a chargé d'affaires to Taiwan, which has hindered friendly exchanges between the people of China and Argentina.
    However, it is the common desire of the people of China and Argentina to develop economic, cultural, and friendly relations between the two countries. The Chinese government has always advocated and supported friendly exchanges between the Chinese people and the people of all countries. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, more than 100 people from Argentina's cultural, business, and other fields have visited China. In 1955 and 1957, delegations from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the People's Bank of China visited Argentina. In 1956, the Chinese Art Troupe visited and performed in Argentina, receiving a warm welcome from the Argentine people. It is believed that with the joint efforts of the people of China and Argentina, this development will increase day by day. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 阿根廷共和国

    阿根廷共和国
    阿根廷是拉丁美洲第二大国，面积二百八十万平方公里，人口二千万。它是一个农牧业的国家，农牧产品的出口为阿根廷提供外汇收入总额的95％左右。同时，阿根廷也是拉丁美洲工业最发达的国家之一。
    阿根廷原来是英国资本在拉丁美洲最重要的根据地，但是在第二次世界大战后，美国在阿根廷的投资和商业势力增长，排挤了英国而在外资中居于优势。
    在1946年到1955年期间，阿根廷一直处于庇隆独裁政府的统治之下。1953年以后，阿根廷经济日益困难，庇隆政府想用投靠美国的办法来寻求出路，把大片土地的石油开采权让给美孚石油公司。这个措施遭到了全国人民的反对。陆海军乘机制造政变，在1955年9月推翻了庇隆政府，由军人组织临时政府。
    自从1955年10月庇隆的政党被解散后，阿根廷传统的“公民激进同盟”成了阿根廷的第一大党。这个党是一个资产阶级和小资产阶级的政党，党的群众大部分有反帝和民主要求。在1957年初，这个党发生了分裂，党内右派集团组成了
  “人民公民激进同盟”，由党主席弗朗迪西领导的左派组成了“不妥协公民激进联盟”。
    不久，阿根廷临时政府就宣布在今年2月23日举行总统、国会议员和地方政权机关的选举。在竞选中，各党派提出了十三个候选人，但实际上是上述两个公民激进联盟之间的竞争。弗朗迪西提出的竞选纲领包括：保卫国家资源；发展民族工业；实行土地改革；扩大对外贸易；反对军事集团；实行和平共处的外交政策和同世界各国建立友好关系等项。他得到阿根廷共产党和其他爱国民主力量的支持。结果，弗朗迪西以二比一的优势击败了临时政府和右派支持的人民公民激进同盟的候选人而当选为总统。他的党还取得国会参议院四十六席的全部、众议院一百八十七席的一百三十三席和全国二十二名省长的职位。阿根廷共产党机关报“我们的话报”以“阿根廷人民的伟大胜利”为题评论这次选举说，人民公民激进同盟在选举中的失败是亲帝国主义的反动势力的失败。人民投票选举弗朗迪西，是希望阿根廷政局朝向民族独立、民主、城乡人民的福利和和平的方向发展。阿根廷共产党还指出，反动势力是不会甘心失败的，因此民主和人民力量应该加强团结以便打败他们的阴谋，保证阿根廷在和平民主的道路上前进。
    弗朗迪西当选以后曾经数次重申阿根廷将同一切国家保持友好关系。他要求拉丁美洲国家执行保卫各国共同利益的经济政策，使拉丁美洲国家获得独立的经济发展，同社会主义阵营各国建立贸易关系以扩大拉丁美洲商品的市场。
    阿根廷同苏联、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚六个社会主义国家有外交关系，是拉丁美洲同社会主义阵营建交最多的国家。民主德国在阿根廷也驻有商务代表团。1954年阿根廷同社会主义阵营的贸易曾占它的贸易总额的10％，现在不到5％。今年1月阿根廷官方商务代表团访问了六个社会主义国家，签订了五十九项总值二千七百万美元的贸易合同。它同其他社会主义国家的贸易也有发展。
    由于美国帝国主义的操纵，阿根廷同蒋介石集团保持着外交关系，去年11月阿根廷临时政府又委派代办驻台湾，使得中阿两国人民之间的友好往来受到阻碍。
    但是，发展中阿两国的经济、文化和友好关系是中阿两国人民的共同愿望。中国政府又一贯主张和支持中国人民同各国人民之间的友好往来。自中华人民共和国成立以来，阿根廷文化界、工商界和其他方面的人士来我国访问的有一百多人。1955年和1957年，我国国际贸易促进会代表团和人民银行代表团先后访问了阿根廷。1956年，中国艺术团在阿根廷访问演出受到阿根廷人民的热烈欢迎。人们相信，在中阿两国人民的共同努力下，这种发展将与日俱增。　（据新华社稿）
