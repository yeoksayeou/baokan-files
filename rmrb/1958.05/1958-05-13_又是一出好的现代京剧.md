　　Another Good Modern Peking Opera
　　Lan Shu
　　After reading Comrade Qu Bo's novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," I was deeply attracted to the part where the reconnaissance hero Yang Zirong penetrated the bandit lair and cleverly captured the bandit leader Mountain Hawk. At that time, I thought that if this were adapted into a play, it would be a good play with sharp contradictions and rich drama. Later, when I heard that it had been adapted into Peking Opera, I felt even more that it must be good. Because there are many such plays in the traditional repertoire of Peking Opera, and the recent performances of two "White Haired Girl" operas can serve as a reference for staging this kind of modern themed Peking Opera.
　　As expected, the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe's performance of "Cleverly Capturing the Bandit Leader Mountain Hawk" received a warm welcome and praise from the audience. The adaptation and the entire performance conveyed the spirit of the original work well, vividly demonstrating the People's Liberation Army's brave and resourceful, optimistic spirit in defeating bandits. The adaptation is basically the same as the plot of the novel, and the individual cuts are also for the sake of being independent and more in line with the requirements of the drama. For example, the scene where this small detachment of soldiers disguised as bandits interrogates a minor bandit under Mountain Hawk's command, rather than Yang Zirong not showing up, he is allowed to do this scene to take the opportunity to test whether he can fool the bandits' ears. In this way, it increases confidence for Yang Zirong to later penetrate the bandit's lair, gain Mountain Hawk's trust, and break through the bandit's nest from the inside out. Another example is in the play, Mountain Hawk is given an adopted daughter named Yizhihua, who wants to get her hands on Yang Zirong as soon as she sees this young man, so she speaks for him everywhere; Yang Zirong takes advantage of the situation and uses Yizhihua's weakness of being fond of the new and tired of the old to better arrange "wine and meat soldiers" at the Baiji Banquet. The existence of the character Yizhihua and her behavior are also reasonable.
　　The entire performance of the play has singing, acting, and fighting, which is the flavor of Peking Opera; several major roles, such as Yang Zirong and Mountain Hawk, have several good songs, which is what Peking Opera audiences expect. It is worth mentioning that the image of the people's soldiers played by the actors playing the People's Liberation Army, especially the reconnaissance hero Yang Zirong and the young commander Shao Jianbo, left a very good impression on the audience. People did not feel that these were people wearing military uniforms, walking square steps, and speaking ancient words, neither ancient nor modern. And this is what the audience is most worried about.
　　Since the Great Leap Forward, flowers have bloomed in the capital's theater garden. The successive performances of the Peking Operas "White Haired Girl" and "Cleverly Capturing the Bandit Leader Mountain Hawk" have made this ancient Peking Opera shine with new brilliance. This not only shows the creative power of the Peking Opera circles freed from the shackles of conservative thinking, but also shows the urgent demand of Peking Opera lovers for modern repertoire.

　　又是一出好的现代京剧
　　蓝澍
    看完了曲波同志的小说“林海雪原”，其中侦察英雄杨子荣深入匪窟，智擒匪首座山雕这一段，深深地吸引了我。当时便想，这要写成戏，可真是一出矛盾尖锐、富有戏剧性的好戏。后来听说被改编成了京戏，更觉得这一定不错。因为京剧的传统剧目中就有不少这一类的戏，而最近两出“白毛女”的演出，更可作为上演这种现代题材的京戏的借鉴。
    果然，北京京剧团演出的“智擒惯匪座山雕”，获得了观众热烈的欢迎和赞扬。这出戏的改编和整个演出都较好地传达了原作的精神，鲜明地表现了人民解放军勇敢机智、战胜匪徒的乐观主义精神。改编本和小说的情节基本相同，个别地方的剪裁，也是为了独立成章，更加符合戏剧的要求。譬如这一小分队战士化装匪徒审问座山雕手下的一个小喽啰，不是杨子荣不露面，而是让他来做这一场戏，趁机考验他倒底能不能混过匪徒的耳目。这样，便为杨子荣后来深入匪穴，取得座山雕的信任里应外合攻破匪巢增加了信心。又如剧中给座山雕添了一个名叫一枝花的干女儿，写她一见杨子荣这个小伙子便想把他搞到手，因此处处为他说话；杨子荣则顺水推舟，利用了一枝花喜新厌旧的弱点，更好地在百鸡宴上布置“酒肉兵”。一枝花这个人物的存在和她这种行为也是合乎情理的。
    整个戏的演出有唱、有做、有打，是京剧的味儿；几个主要的角色，如杨子荣、座山雕等都有几段好唱，更是京剧观众所期望的。值得提出来的是，饰演解放军的演员们所扮演的人民战士的形象，特别是侦察英雄杨子荣和年轻的指战员少剑波，给观众留下了很好的印象。人们并没有感到这是些穿军装、走方步、讲古话，不古不今的人。而这一点却是观众最担心的。
    大跃进以来，首都戏剧园中鲜花盛开，京剧“白毛女”和“智擒惯匪座山雕”的相继演出，使这古老的京剧也放出新的光彩。这不仅显示了京剧界从保守思想的桎梏中解放出来的创造力量，也说明了爱好京剧的观众对于现代剧目的迫切要求。
