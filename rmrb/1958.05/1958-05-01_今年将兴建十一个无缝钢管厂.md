    Eleven Seamless Steel Pipe Plants to be Built This Year

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, after consulting with various provinces and cities recently, decided to build a large seamless steel pipe plant with an annual output of 100,000 tons and ten small seamless steel pipe plants with an annual output of 7,000 tons this year.

    These ten small seamless steel pipe plants will be built in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Nanchang. After all of them are completed this year, China will not only have Anshan Iron and Steel as one large seamless steel pipe plant and Shanghai as one small seamless steel pipe plant, but will have more than a dozen seamless steel pipe plants spread all over the country. At that time, a large supply of seamless steel pipes with an outer diameter of 8 to 100 mm needed by these regions will be available.

    Since these seamless steel pipe plants are small in scale and have simple equipment, the investment is very small. Calculated according to the investment required for each ton of seamless steel pipe produced annually, it only accounts for about 10% of the investment in the seamless steel pipe plant of Anshan Iron and Steel. The construction speed is also very fast, and it can be completed in less than six months. Their total output is 10,000 tons more than that of Anshan Iron and Steel's seamless steel pipe plant.

    今年将兴建十一个无缝钢管厂
    本报讯　冶金工业部最近同各省市商议以后，决定在今年建设一个年产十万吨的大型无缝钢管厂和十个年产七千吨的小型无缝钢管厂。
    这十个小型无缝钢管厂将分别建设在北京、天津、上海、广州、西安、太原和南昌等地。在今年全部建成以后，我国将不仅仅有鞍钢一个大无缝钢管厂和上海一个小无缝钢管厂，而是有十几个无缝钢管厂遍布全国各地。那时候，这些地区所需要的八到一百公厘外径的无缝钢管将得到大量供应。
    由于这些无缝钢管厂规模很小，设备简单，因而投资很少。按年产每吨无缝钢管所需的投资计算，只占鞍钢无缝钢管厂投资的10％左右。建设速度也很快，只用六个月不到的时间就可以建成。它们的总产量比鞍钢无缝钢管厂还多一万吨。（附图片）
