Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, May 27th: Despite the frantic attacks launched by the pro-Western Lebanese government against the insurgents using various modern weapons supplied by Western countries, the insurgent people in Lebanon are continuing to expand their controlled areas, and their momentum is growing.

It is reported that after fierce fighting, the Lebanese rebel forces completely controlled Hasbaya and Rashaya, southeast of the capital Beirut, on the 26th. On the same day, the people's forces occupied the police and gendarmerie strongholds in six villages, including Obeida, southwest of Beirut. Sources say that, with the exception of a few small areas, the rebel forces have controlled the entire northern Lebanon.

According to Damascus Radio, government forces launched an attack on the rebel forces in Saida (Sidon), a major port in southern Lebanon, on the 26th, but were forced to retreat after three hours of fierce fighting. The government garrison in Marjayoun, south of Saida, has been surrounded by the rebel forces. At the same time, fierce fighting continues in Baalbek in northern Lebanon and in Midarij on the Beirut-Damascus highway.

According to "Free Lebanon Radio," since the Lebanese people's forces issued a warning on the 25th that armed elements supporting the government should surrender their weapons, fifty members of the National Social Party have surrendered with their weapons to the people's army command in various places.

At the same time, it is reported that the pro-Western Lebanese government, with the increased support of Western countries, is launching a new offensive against the insurgent people. Chamoun's air force is fiercely bombing the people's rebel forces in the Baalbek area. Zuraia, the leader of the rebel forces in the Minia area, revealed that government planes had strafed villages with machine guns, killing and wounding about 100 people. The government army also killed about 120 head of livestock used for farming.

Damascus Radio reported that on the 26th, fascist National Social Party members supporting Chamoun placed a time bomb in a tram in Beirut, killing and wounding dozens of people. The Lebanese National Front, composed of people from various opposition parties, issued a statement pointing out that the National Social Party members did this to create incidents to undermine the struggle of the Lebanese people.

The Damascus newspaper "Al-Nour" reported on the 27th that more than 300 members of the National Social Party recently arrived in Lebanon from Jordan to participate in the suppression of the insurgent people. The Middle East News Agency said that planes arrive in Beirut from Amman and Baghdad every day, carrying Jordanian and Iraqi soldiers to help Chamoun suppress the insurgent people.

Chamoun held another secret meeting with the US, British, and French ambassadors on the 26th. This was their second secret meeting in 24 hours. On the same day, Prime Minister Solh also held a secret meeting with the Turkish ambassador.

    黎巴嫩起义军控制北部地区
    并占领贝鲁特东南两个重要据点
    夏蒙和索勒哈连日同美英法土四国大使密谈
    据新华社大马士革27日电　尽管黎巴嫩亲西方政府利用西方国家供给的各种现代武器对起义者发动了疯狂的进攻，黎巴嫩各地起义人民正在继续扩大他们的控制地区，声势越来越浩大。
    据报道，经过激战后，黎巴嫩起义人民部队在26日完全控制了首都贝鲁特东南面的哈斯贝亚和赖沙亚。人民部队在同一天占领了贝鲁特西南面的奥贝达等六个村庄的警察和宪兵据点。有消息说，除个别小地区外，起义人民部队已经控制了整个北黎巴嫩。
    据大马士革电台广播，政府部队在26日对黎巴嫩南部主要港口赛伊达（即西顿）的人民起义部队发动进攻，但是在激战三小时后被迫退却。在赛伊达南面的马尔贾荣的政府驻军已经被人民起义部队包围。同时，在黎巴嫩北部的巴尔贝克和在贝鲁特—大马士革公路上的米达里治，激战还在继续进行中。
    据“自由黎巴嫩电台”广播，自从黎巴嫩人民部队在25日发出警告要支持政府的武装分子交出武器之后，已经有五十名国家社会党徒携械分别向各地人民军指挥部投降。
    同时据报道，黎巴嫩亲西方政府在西方国家加紧支持下，正对起义人民发动了新进攻。夏蒙的空军在巴尔贝克地区猛烈轰炸人民起义部队。米尼亚地区起义人民部队领导人祖拉亚揭露，政府的飞机曾经用机枪扫射村庄，被打死打伤的约有一百人。政府军还杀死耕用牲畜约一百二十头。
    大马士革电台报道，支持夏蒙的法西斯国家社会党徒26日在贝鲁特把一颗定时炸弹放在电车中，炸死炸伤几十人。由各反对党派人士组成的黎巴嫩民族阵线发表声明指出，国家社会党徒这样做是为了制造事件以破坏黎巴嫩人民的斗争。
    大马士革“光明报”27日报道，三百多名国家社会党徒最近从约旦到达黎巴嫩，参加镇压起义人民。中东通讯社说，每天都有飞机从安曼和巴格达到达贝鲁特，运来约旦和伊拉克的士兵，来帮助夏蒙镇压起义人民。
    夏蒙在26日再度同美、英、法三国大使密谈。这是他们在二十四时内第二次密谈。同一天，总理索勒哈也同土耳其大使举行了密谈。
