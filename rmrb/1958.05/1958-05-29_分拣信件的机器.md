    Machine for Sorting Letters

    Sang Zhaolin, a national postal labor model and sorter at the Shanghai Post Office, after more than a year of dedicated research and with the help of fraternal units and relevant departments, finally successfully trial-produced China's first push-button letter sorting machine on April 29th, opening up a path for the mechanization of postal operations in our country.

    The Shanghai Post Office handles four to five hundred thousand letters to and from various locations at home and abroad every day, all of which are sorted manually, resulting in high labor intensity and low efficiency. With this sorting machine, sorters only need to sit in front of the machine like typists and press the button according to the address on the letter (such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Changchun...) that is sent to the reading window by the conveyor belt. The letters can then be quickly and accurately sorted into various compartments (each compartment is assigned a place name), and the number of letters can be automatically recorded.

    分拣信件的机器
    全国邮电劳动模范、上海市邮局分拣员桑兆麟，经过一年多的钻研，在兄弟单位和有关部门的帮助下，终于在4月29日试制成功我国第一部电钮信件分拣机，为我国邮政操作走上机械化开辟了道路。
    上海邮局与国内外各地间的来往信件，每天有四、五十万件，都靠人工分拣，劳动强度高，效率低。有了这种分拣机，分拣员只要像打字员一样坐在机器前面，根据传送带送至阅件窗口信件上的地址（如北京、广州、长春……）揿动电钮，就可以迅速、正确地把信一封一封分拣到各个格眼中（每一个格眼规定一个地名），并且还能自动记录信件数量。
