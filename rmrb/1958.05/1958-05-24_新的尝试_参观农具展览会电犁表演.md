    New Attempt
    Visiting the Agricultural Tool Exhibition's Electric Plow Demonstration
    By Our Reporter Chen Baolian
    At the demonstration ground of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition, after the button of a three-horsepower electric motor was pressed, a four-wheeled double-share plow, which required neither draft animals nor a tractor, moved straight forward automatically, turning over the yellow-black soil. When the plow reached the end, the iron rod extending in front of the plow, resembling an ordinary plow handle, struck the pre-placed automatic shifting device on the edge of the field, and the plow body automatically shifted to the next row. Pressing another button, the plow returned, plowing again. The person plowing the field sat on the edge of the field and pressed the button. The electric plow automatically plowed back and forth in the field, and the same thing happened when an ordinary harrow was used to harrow back and forth, it was really easy.
    This electric plow is driven by an electric motor that pulls a steel cable, which in turn pulls the plow back and forth.
    This method of using an electric motor to pull the plow is a recent design by the Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Research Institute. It is a new attempt and bold creation to use electricity in field operations. The electric plow, originally designed to solve the problem of cultivating rotten mud fields in the South, has now become an attempt to use electricity for field cultivation, paving the way for the use of electricity in plowing. Several years ago, Jiangsu Province, in order to solve the difficulty of cultivating rotten mud fields, studied methods of pulling farm tools for cultivation from outside the field. Jiangsu Province successfully tested wind-powered and animal-powered turntables, using the turntables to pull farm tools for cultivation in the fields. Fujian Province also designed an electric plow to solve the problem of cultivating rotten mud fields, and it is already being tested and promoted. The exhibition not only features the electric plow designed by the research institute, but also the electric plow from Fujian and the wind-powered turntable-pulled plow from Jiangsu. Many visiting farmers were attracted by the electric plow demonstration.
    The reporter interviewed Comrade Zhang Qing, who was in charge of trial-producing this machine at the Agricultural Mechanization and Electrification Research Institute. He said that trial-producing power rope traction machinery for cultivation is an important task for him and technicians Xia Deji and Zhou Minxia this year. Before this, they had gone deep into the workshops and studied with the workers, and with the help of the workers, they overcame many difficulties before completing the design of the electric plow and the shifting device. The purpose of their designing the electric plow was inspired by Jiangsu and Fujian, and they tried to use electricity for field cultivation. Because electricity is the cheapest power source, and wherever there is water, electricity can be generated in the future. In the design, their first concern was the safety of farmers using electricity. They modified the electric motor, appropriately reduced the voltage, and used an electrical circuit device to reduce the voltage and current on the shifting device to a level that is not dangerous even if a person touches it. Zhang Qing said that since their designed electric plow officially debuted on May 1st, they have also received some feedback from visitors, and they plan to continue to improve it to make it safer and cheaper. Before July, they plan to trial-produce several units and send them to various places for testing and evaluation by farmers. This electric plow and electric harrow are only part of their trial-production of traction machinery for paddy fields, and they also plan to produce a complete set of traction machinery for paddy fields from cultivation to harvesting.
    The use of electricity in farmland operations is still in the experimental stage in the world. After the successful attempt to use electricity for field cultivation, with the development of farmland hydropower, China's agricultural production technology will usher in a completely new situation.

### 新的尝试  参观农具展览会电犁表演

    新的尝试
    参观农具展览会电犁表演
    本报记者　陈保廉
    在全国农具展览会的表演场上，当三马力电动机的电钮被按动以后，一架不用耕畜、也不用拖拉机牵引的四轮双铧犁，就笔直地自动前进，把黄黑色的新土翻了起来。当这部犁走到尽头，伸在犁前形似普通犁把手的铁杆撞着预先放置在田埂上的自动移行器，犁身就自动向旁边移一行；再按另一电钮，犁又耕着回来了。耕田的人坐在田埂上按电钮，电犁在田中自动来回耕地、换上普通耙就同样来回耙地，真是轻快极了。
    这种电犁是由电动机牵动钢丝绳，钢丝绳便拉着犁来回前进。
    这个用电动机牵引耕田的办法，是我国农业机械化电气化研究所最近设计的。它是将电用于田间作业的新的尝试和大胆创造。在南方为解决烂泥田耕作设计的电犁，现在成了田间耕作用电的尝试，给耕作用电开了路。几年前江苏省为了解决烂泥田无法下田耕作的困难，就研究了在田外牵引农具耕作的办法。江苏省试验成功的有风车搅盘和畜力搅盘，利用搅盘牵引农具在田里耕作。福建省为解决烂泥田耕作也设计了电犁，并且已经在试验推广。这次展览会表演的不只有研究所设计的，还有福建的电犁和江苏的风车搅盘牵引犁。许多参观的农民都为电犁的表演所吸引。
    记者访问了农业机械化电气化研究所试制这一机具的张清同志。他说，试制电力绳索牵引机具耕作是他和夏得济、周敏霞几位技术员今年的重要课题。在此以前，他们曾深入车间和工人一起研究，得到工人的帮助，克服了不少困难，才完成了电犁和移行器的设计。他们设计电犁的目的是受了江苏和福建的启发，试图把电用于田间耕作。因为电是最廉价的动力，有水的地方将来就能发电。设计中他们首先注意的是农民用电安全的问题。他们改造了电动机，适当降低了电压，并通过电圈装置使移行器上的电压和电流减弱到人接触到也丝毫没有危险。张清说，他们设计的电犁从“五一”正式表演后，也收到参观者一些意见，他们还准备继续改进，使之更安全，造价更低。7月份以前计划试制几部，送到各地试验，请农民鉴定。这架电犁和电耙只是他们试制水田牵引机具的一部分，他们还计划制出水田从耕到收的全套牵引机具。
    将电力用于农田作业，目前在世界上也还处于试验的阶段。田间耕作用电的尝试成功后，随着农田水电事业的发展，我国的农业生产技术将出现一个完全新的局面。
