    Publish More Academic Trends Both in China and Abroad

    I very much enjoy reading papers on philosophy, politics, literature and art, and science. However, there are so many newspapers and magazines now that I cannot read them all one by one. It would be good if the People's Daily could publish more academic trends both in China and abroad. In this way, we can often know the latest trends in other academic fields besides our own major, so that our vision will not be too narrow, and we can learn the most in the least amount of time.

    多登中外学术动态
    我很喜欢看哲学、政治、文艺、科学等方面的论文。不过现在的报章杂志很多，不能一一遍阅。人民日报如果能多登一些中外学术动态，那就好了。这样，我们就可以经常知道除自己的专业外的其他各门学术的最近动向，使自己的眼光不至过于狭窄，并且用最少的时间获悉最多的东西。
