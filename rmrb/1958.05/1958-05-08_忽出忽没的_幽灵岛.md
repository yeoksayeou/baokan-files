    Elusive "Phantom Islands"

    Not long ago, a small island with trees growing on it was discovered 400 nautical miles off the east coast of North America. However, it disappeared shortly after its discovery. This was reported in the latest issue of the Soviet magazine "Around the World."

    The magazine said that there are many such "phantom islands" that appear and disappear in the world.

    One of the most famous phantom islands is Graham Island, located 25 nautical miles south of Sicily in the Mediterranean. For a hundred years, it has repeatedly appeared and disappeared. Its most recent appearance was in 1950. But just as diplomats were arguing endlessly over the island's sovereignty, it suddenly disappeared into the water again.

    Not long ago, near the north coast of South America, a British warship sailed from Trinidad to a small island that suddenly appeared nearby. A solemn flag-raising ceremony was held on the island, declaring it British territory. However, a few days later, the island suddenly sank into the ocean. People didn't even have time to name the island and include it on maps.

    The disappearance of islands can sometimes cause tragedies. In the second half of the last century, such a tragedy occurred on Tuanaqi Island in the Cook Islands (northeast of New Zealand) in the Pacific. One early morning, the fishermen went out to sea. When they returned in the evening, the island had disappeared. Only a vast expanse of ocean remained where an island inhabited by 13,000 people had stood just a few hours earlier.

    The magazine said that these events can be explained by underwater earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

    However, the strange movements of Dougherty Island in the South Pacific cannot necessarily be explained by volcanic activity. For decades, sailors from different countries have successively reported the existence of this island. But when scientists went to find the island and wanted to mark it on the map, they found nothing at the location where the island should have been. On the contrary, they measured the ocean depth here to be 4,500 meters. This situation cannot necessarily be explained by volcanic activity. This mystery remains to be solved in the future.

### 忽出忽没的“幽灵岛”

    忽出忽没的“幽灵岛”
    不久以前，在离北美洲东海岸四百浬的地方发现了一个不大的岛，岛上还长有树木，然而就在发现以后不久就消失了。这是苏联最近一期“环球”杂志报道的。
    杂志说，世界上有不少的这样时隐时现的“幽灵岛”。
    最著名的幽灵岛之一是位于地中海西西里岛以南二十五浬的格雷海姆岛。一百年来，它曾经一再出现和消失。最近一次出现，是在1950年。可是正当外交家们喋喋不休地为岛屿主权争执的时候，它又突然隐没水中。
    前不太久，在南美洲北海岸附近，一艘英国军舰从特立尼达岛开到了附近突然出现的一个小岛上，在岛上举行了庄严的升旗式，宣布这个岛为英国所有。然而，几天以后，这个岛就突然没入大洋中去了。人们甚至没有来得及给这个岛命名，和把它绘进地图中。
    岛屿的消失，有时会造成一些悲剧。上一世纪后半期，太平洋中库卡群岛（新西兰东北）中的图阿纳基岛就发生了这样的惨剧。一天清早，渔民们出海去了。傍晚归来，岛已消失。在几小时前还住着一万三千人的岛的所在地只剩下了一片汪洋。
    杂志说，这些事件可以用海底地震和火山爆发的结果来解释。
    然而，南太平洋中的道格蒂—艾兰岛的奇怪行踪却未必能用火山活动来解释。几十年来，不同国家的海员们曾经陆续报道过这个岛的存在。可是当科学家们去找这个岛，想把它标在地图上的时候，却在这个岛所应在的位置什么也未找到，相反，他们测得的这里海洋深度达到四千五百公尺。这种情况未必能用火山活动来解释。这个谜尚待今后努力解决。
