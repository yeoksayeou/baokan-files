    Why?

    Do Not Sun Leather Goods During the "Willow Catkin" Season

    There is a reason why leather goods should not be sunned during the "willow catkin" season.

    The so-called "willow catkin" is actually not a willow catkin, but rather the seed of the poplar tree. The seeds of the poplar tree are very small, about one-twentieth the size of a grain of rice. The fruit of the poplar tree is filled with fine, downy fibers, containing three or four seeds. When the fruit ripens, it splits open, and after being exposed to wind and sun, the fine downy fibers automatically loosen, allowing the seeds to drift everywhere.

    Fur is fluffy, and the "willow catkins" can easily get tangled in it. The seeds contain a certain amount of moisture, which affects the cleanliness and dryness of the fur. During the rainy season, the fur is likely to become damp and moldy, even turning into "bald patches" as a result.

    It is also not advisable to sun leather goods during the plum rain season. Because at that time, the air is very humid and the weather is changeable, making it prone to rain.

    It is also necessary to sun the leather goods and then put some camphor in them to prevent insects and decay.

### 落“杨花”时节不晒皮货

专栏：为什么？

    落“杨花”时节不晒皮货
    落“杨花”时节不晒皮货，是有道理的。
    所谓落“杨花”，实际上并不是杨花，而是杨树的种子。杨树的种子很小，大约相当于米粒的二十分之一大小。杨树的果实内充满细绒的纤维，内包三、四粒种子。当果实成熟时即裂开，风吹日晒后，细绒纤维就自动松散开，种子乘此飘荡到各处。
    毛皮是毛绒绒的，“杨花”飘进去很容易搅在一起。种子内含有一定的水分，这样就影响了毛皮的纯净和干燥。在多雨季节，皮毛难免因此还潮发霉，甚至变成“光板”。
    在黄梅天，也是不晒皮货的。因为那时空气很潮湿，而且天气多变，容易下雨。
    皮货晒过再放些樟脑防虫防腐也是必要的。
