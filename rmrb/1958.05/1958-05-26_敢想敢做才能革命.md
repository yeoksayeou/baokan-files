Only Daring to Think and Act Can Make Revolution
Chen Zhiyan

Speaking of revolution, it is certainly a profound and far-reaching event. Throughout history, every revolution has propelled the development of society to a new stage, and revolution has become the locomotive of history. But revolution is also an extremely arduous undertaking. Not to mention historical or foreign revolutions, just take the revolution in which the Chinese people overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. It took more than twenty years, and countless cruel struggles, to win the People's Republic of China.

After basically completing the socialist revolution, we are now going to carry out another great revolution—the technological revolution. This revolution will bring us to a completely new field. This is a huge revolution to develop China's productive forces, which will transform China from a country with very backward productive forces into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. It is conceivable that this is not an easy task, but an undertaking as arduous as any revolution.

The matter is arduous, but it is not unimaginable or unconquerable. Otherwise, why could we have won the victories in past revolutions? A crucial key is: do we dare to think and dare to act? Crossing this hurdle will allow for revolution.

The forces of the old things seem to be very powerful, and they are constantly showing you their power, as if to say: this is how it was in the past, and this is how it will be in the future. No one can change it. If you also believe this, then you have been fooled. In fact, the old things must be replaced by the new things, just like people must die when they get old, and babies must grow up. It is an objective law of the development of things. What is truly powerful is the newborn things, and the old things are just using their afterglow to reflect.

Probably many people have had this feeling and understanding: it is difficult to imagine mechanizing China's agriculture, and changing all labor that can be operated by machines to mechanical operation. At least, it is an extremely distant matter, and it is difficult to say in what year and month it will happen. In fact, this is an illusion. As long as we dare to think about changing it, and dare to put it into practice with the momentum of a bamboo splitting, things will fundamentally change.

Today, this newspaper published the story of the Laohekou Iron Production Cooperative in Hubei, which transformed a cooperative mainly based on manual operation into a cooperative mainly based on machine operation (70% mechanized) in just three months. This shows that mechanization is not a mysterious thing. The masses can use their own minds and hands to achieve it in a not very long time. Although this mechanization is still elementary, it is an unstoppable new force.

Only daring to think and act can make revolution. To dare to think and act, we must break all superstitions and jump out of the circle of old things. In this way, you will find how powerful our strength is, and there is no peak that we cannot reach.

    敢想敢做才能革命
    陈之衍
    提起革命，这当然是一件影响深远的大事情。古往今来，每次革命都把社会的发展推向新的阶段，革命成了历史的火车头。可是革命又是一件何等艰巨的事业，不说历史上的也不说外国的，就拿我国人民推翻国民党的反动统治这次革命来说，前前后后花了二十多年的时间，经过了无数的残酷斗争，才赢得了中华人民共和国。
    在基本上完成了社会主义革命以后，现在我们又要进行另一次伟大的革命——技术革命，这个革命将把我们带到一个崭新的领域中去。这是一次发展我国生产力的巨大革命，将使我国从一个生产力很落后的国家，变为一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家。可以想像，这不是一件轻松的事，而是一项和任何革命一样艰巨的事业。
    事情是艰巨的，但并不是不可想像的和不能征服的，要不然为什么我们能取得过去历次革命的胜利？极其重要的一关是：敢不敢想，敢不敢做。越过了这一关，就能革命。
    旧事物的势力看起来似乎是很强大的，它时刻向你显示它的威力，似乎是说：过去是这样，将来也是这样。谁也无法去改变它。如果你也相信这一点，那末就上了当。其实，旧事物一定要被新事物所代替，正像人老了一定要死，婴儿一定要长大一样，是事物发展的客观规律。真正强大的是新生的事物，而旧事物只不过是用它的回光来返照而已。
    大概很多人都有过这种感觉和认识：要想把我国的农业机械化，把一切能够使用机器操作的劳动都改为机械操作，这是一件很难想像的事。至少，这是一件极其遥远、很难说是何年何月的事。其实，这是假象。只要我们敢于想改变它，敢于以势如破竹的行动去实践，事情就会发生根本变化。
    今天本报发表的湖北老河口铁业生产合作社，仅仅用了三个月的时间，就把一个以手工操作为主的合作社，改变为以机器操作为主（70％机械化）的合作社，这说明了机械化并不是什么神秘的事，群众可以用自己的头脑和双手，在并不是很长的时间内实现它。这种机械化虽然还是初级的，但它却是不可遏止的新生力量。
    敢想敢做才能革命。要敢想敢做，就要破除一切迷信，从旧事物圈子里跳出来，这样你就会发现我们的力量是多么的强大，没有什么我们不能到达的高峰。
