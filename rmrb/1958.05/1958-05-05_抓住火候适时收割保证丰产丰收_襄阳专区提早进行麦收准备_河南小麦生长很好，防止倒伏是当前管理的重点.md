　　Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 3rd: Xiangyang Prefecture in Hubei Province is making intense preparations for the wheat harvest.

　　The entire district has organized more than six thousand handicraft workers to help farmers process sickles, ropes, weeding hoes, winnowing fans, shovels... Thousands of iron and woodworking repair teams have gone to various agricultural cooperatives to help repair and manufacture various farm tools. Hundreds of purchasing personnel from supply and marketing cooperatives and commercial departments have been traveling day and night to Hankou, Henan, Tianjin, and other places to purchase large quantities of three-pronged weeding hoes, threshing machines, steel wire, burlap sacks, and other tools, as well as raw materials such as Phoebe nanmu bamboo and pig iron for handicraft workers to process. In order to save the agricultural cooperatives' labor in processing rice and flour, the grain departments of various counties have signed contracts with the agricultural cooperatives to process rice and flour, ensuring a steady supply during the wheat harvest. Commercial and grain departments have also organized a large number of peddlers, preparing to deliver oil, salt, and other daily necessities to the fields during the wheat harvest.

　　More than eight thousand agricultural cooperatives in the district are mobilizing the masses to offer suggestions and ideas, rationally arrange labor, and at the same time rush to complete various farm tasks that can be done in advance, such as delivering fertilizer and tidying up wheat fields. Currently, more than five thousand agricultural cooperatives in the district have arranged labor for the wheat harvest. In order to improve labor efficiency, various counties are vigorously promoting new types of agricultural tools and continuing to carry out tool reforms on a large scale. Due to this year's bumper wheat harvest, the original warehouses of various agricultural cooperatives are not enough, and new warehouses are being built and borrowed.

　　It is estimated that the total output of seven million mu of wheat in Xiangyang Prefecture this year will double compared to last year. The amount of labor required for farm work such as wheat harvesting, threshing, and field transportation will be much greater than last year. At the same time, about two million mu of wheat fields will be converted into paddy fields while harvesting, and another 1.6 million mu of cotton intercropped in wheat fields needs to be weeded and stubble cleared in a timely manner. Therefore, various farm tasks will be extremely tense and busy during the wheat harvest. Failure to seize the right moment will definitely affect the harvest work, so it is very important to make various preparations for the wheat harvest in advance. The Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party specifically studied the wheat harvest preparation work at the county party secretary meeting held from April 9th to 15th, and proposed the slogan of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick rice transplanting, and quick weeding and stubble clearing.

　　Our newspaper, Zhengzhou, 3rd: The more than 70 million mu of wheat in Henan Province has large ears, thick stalks, lush stems and leaves, and is growing better than ever before. Now, wheat in the province has begun to bloom successively. Under the slogan of "Management Doesn't Stop Until Wheat is Harvested," farmers in various places are conscientiously strengthening late-stage management and striving for a bumper wheat harvest.

　　Currently, the first category of wheat fields in the province has expanded from the original 30 million mu to more than 50 million mu, and the third category of wheat has decreased from the original 13 million mu to 3 million mu. According to the provincial agricultural department, incomplete statistics from eighty-two counties show that there are an estimated 17 million mu with a unit area yield of more than 400 to 800 catties.

　　In order to ensure that "every plot achieves a bumper harvest," the local Chinese Communist Party organizations are now regarding the prevention of lodging that may occur in high-yielding wheat fields and some particularly well-grown first-category wheat fields during the flowering and grain-filling periods as an important part of strengthening the late-stage management of wheat.

    抓住火候适时收割保证丰产丰收
    襄阳专区提早进行麦收准备
    河南小麦生长很好，防止倒伏是当前管理的重点
    据新华社武汉3日电　湖北省襄阳专区正紧张地为麦收进行各项准备工作。
    全区已组织六千多手工业工人帮助农民加工镰刀、绳子、耘锄、簸箕、锨板……。数以千计的铁木工修配小组已到各农业社帮助修理制造各种农具。供销社和商业部门的几百名采购人员披星戴月地分赴汉口、河南、天津等地采购了大批三齿耘锄、脱粒机、钢丝、麻布袋等工具，以及供手工业者加工用的楠竹、生铁等原料。各县粮食部门为了节省农业社加工米面的劳动力，都同农业社订好加工米面合同，保证收麦时源源供应。商业和粮食部门还组织大批货郎担，准备到麦收时把油盐和其他日用品送到地里。
    全区八千多个农业社正在发动群众献计献策，合理安排劳动力，同时把各种可以提前做的如送肥、整理麦场等农活提前赶做。现在全区有五千多个农业社已经安排好麦收的劳动力。为了提高劳动效率，各县正在大力推广新式农具，继续大搞工具改革。由于今年小麦大丰收，各农业社原有的仓库都不够用，现正赶建和筹借仓库。
    襄阳专区今年七百万亩小麦预计产量将比去年增加一倍，割麦、打场、田间运输等农活所需的劳动量将比去年大得多。同时今年有二百万亩左右的麦地要边割边改水田，还有一百六十万亩在麦地套种的棉花需要及时锄草灭茬。因此麦收时各种农活将异常紧张繁忙，如抢不住火候一定会影响收获工作，所以提早作好麦收各项准备工作十分重要。中共襄阳地委早在4月9日到15日召开的县委书记会议上就专门研究了麦收准备工作，并提出快割、快打、快插秧、快锄草灭茬的口号。
    本报郑州3日电　河南省七千多万亩小麦穗大、秆粗，茎叶茂密，生长良好为历年所未有。现在全省小麦已相继开始扬花。各地农民正在“麦不收割，管理不停”的口号下，认真加强后期管理，力争小麦丰收。
    现在，全省第一类麦田已从原有的三千多万亩扩大到五千多万亩，第三类麦从原来的一千三百万亩减少至三百万亩。据省农业部门了解，在八十二个县内不完全统计，预计单位面积产量在四百斤到八百斤以上的有一千七百万亩。
    为了保证做到“块块丰收”，现在，各地中共组织都把领导农民积极防止小麦丰产田和一部分长得特别好的第一类麦田，在扬花和灌浆期间可能发生的倒伏现象，看作是当前加强小麦后期管理的一项重要内容。　（阚枫）
