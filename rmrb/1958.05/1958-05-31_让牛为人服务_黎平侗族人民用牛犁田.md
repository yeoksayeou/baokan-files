    Letting Cattle Serve Humanity
    The Dong People of Liping Use Cattle to Plow Fields
    In the Shuikou, Long'e and other areas of Liping County in the Southeastern Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, the Dong people have completely changed from human-powered plowing to cattle-powered plowing this year, and the backward state of production has been completely changed. Shi Changlin and Shi Yufu, the directors of the Dengta Cooperative in Long'e Township, took the lead in developing new agricultural implements and using cattle to plow fields. The cooperative members also contributed plow beams (timber) to build new agricultural implements, and the old plow bars (used for human plowing) became waste. No one is pulling plows in the fields anymore. (Yang Xianhao)

    让牛为人服务
    黎平侗族人民用牛犁田
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州黎平县的水口、龙额等地区的侗族人民，今年全部改人犁田变牛犁田，落后的生产面貌焕然改观。龙额乡灯塔社主任石昌林、石玉福带头搞新式农具和带头用耕牛犁田，社员们也纷纷献犁弯（木料）造新式农具，旧犁杠（人犁田用的）变成了废物。田野里再没有人拉犁了。（杨贤豪）
