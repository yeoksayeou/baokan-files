    Scheduled Transportation
    Communist Party of China Yantai Automobile Transportation Branch Committee
    Since our company fully implemented fixed-schedule and fixed-point passenger bus services in December of last year and piloted scheduled freight transport in the Wendeng dispatch area, it has begun to change the backward situation of the enterprise, providing greater transportation capacity for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture.

    Inside and Out, Conflicts Abound

    Before the implementation of scheduled transport, there were numerous conflicts inside and outside the enterprise. External conflicts mainly manifested in two aspects. One was the conflict between the carrier and the shipper. Because we only had five-day work plans, without specific times for trucks to arrive at loading and unloading locations, cargo owners could not prepare in advance, preventing trucks from being loaded and unloaded in a timely manner, extending downtime; or cargo owners prepared well, but the trucks did not arrive as scheduled, causing waste of manpower, materials, and time for the cargo owners, with both sides complaining to each other. This contradiction also affected the normal operation of the loading and unloading departments, often delaying loading and unloading and causing idle work, with loading and unloading workers having opinions about both the cargo owners and the transportation company. The other was the conflict between the enterprise and passengers. Passenger buses did not have fixed departure or arrival times, passengers had to queue for a long time, and still might not get a seat, often leading to disputes. Internal conflicts mainly manifested in the failure of various production links to connect well. For example, vehicle dispatch lacked a sound quota system, the five-day operation plans that were drawn up were inaccurate, making it difficult for drivers to execute, and a few drivers took the opportunity to arbitrarily change operation plans, undermining the seriousness of the plan. In order to complete transport tasks, dispatchers often failed to promptly recall vehicles that should have been returned to the factory for maintenance, disrupting the maintenance operation plans of the fleet, while delayed maintenance and factory releases of vehicles made dispatch work passive, often causing transport capacity arrangements to fall through. Passenger bus stop times also lacked quotas, with drivers deciding when to stop and depart, making it impossible for station managers to direct. Because there were no specific operating times, and loading and unloading were not timely, drivers often rushed to load and unload in order to complete tasks, violating operating procedures, forcibly overtaking or blocking the road, greatly affecting the unity among workers and traffic safety.

    These internal and external contradictions brought serious consequences. First of all, the state wasted a great deal of transportation capacity. According to our survey of 247 truck working days, the time wasted due to waiting for loading and unloading amounted to more than 10,000 minutes, an average of 41 minutes wasted per working day (individual cases reaching as high as three hours). Based on our company's current 147 trucks, this is equivalent to 11 trucks being out of service every day. Furthermore, according to the analysis of passenger bus survey data, over 103 working days, over 4,000 minutes were wasted due to excessively long stop times, an average of 39 minutes wasted per working day. Based on our company's current 71 passenger buses, this is equivalent to 6 buses being out of service every day.

    Second, the waste of manpower and materials for cargo owners and loading and unloading departments was also very serious. For example, when transporting live pigs to the Wendeng Food Company, this company wasted 100,000 catties of feed every season due to the uncertain start times. Some rural grain stations also concentrated grain from warehouses to loading and unloading points to await transport, and then had to move it back to the warehouses because the trucks did not arrive as scheduled. The resulting waste of manpower and grain consumption was substantial. As for the idle labor losses caused by loading and unloading workers waiting, these are even more difficult to calculate.

    Third, the drivers' working hours increased. According to statistics from the Wendeng dispatch area, truck drivers worked as long as 10 hours and 45 minutes per day, while the actual working time was only about nine hours, with the remaining time wasted on waiting for loading and unloading and handling procedures. This was one of the most acute problems that the enterprise had failed to resolve for a long time.

    Fourth, due to the lack of strict time quotas, some drivers were undisciplined, disobeyed commands, violated operating rules, affecting the consolidation of the enterprise's labor discipline; it also increased the risk of accidents.

    Scheduled Transport, Everybody's Happy

    Regarding these contradictions, our leadership was not clear-headed from the beginning. For a considerable period of time, we only saw that the drivers' long working hours were the most prominent problem in our enterprise management, and we lacked a sufficient understanding of the actual state of backward enterprise management. During the rectification movement, the broad masses of employees exposed a large number of contradictions in various aspects of the enterprise, demanding a swift change in the backward state of enterprise management. We began to realize that the essence of these contradictions was a reflection of the poor collaboration between various links within the enterprise and between the transport enterprise and the materials departments and loading and unloading departments, and that the root cause of poor collaboration lay in our backward planning management. The crux of backward planning management was that we had not grasped the basic link of scheduled transport. Therefore, to resolve the various contradictions inside and outside the enterprise, we must resolutely implement scheduled transport. Scheduled transport can promote collaboration in all aspects, and to achieve scheduled transport, we must first do a good job of collaboration in all aspects. The two are dialectically mutually causal and mutually promoting.

    In order to implement scheduled transport, we first conducted on-the-spot surveys and recordings with vehicles. Based on the survey data, we formulated various operating time quotas, and compiled fixed-point operation charts for passenger buses and five-day operation work plans for freight trucks according to the quotas. At the same time, we vigorously strengthened cooperation with cargo owners, and signed "Loading and Unloading Responsibility Agreements" with cargo owners, stipulating that the transport department should notify the cargo owner of the specific arrival time of the vehicle the day before loading and unloading materials, and guarantee arrival at the loading and unloading point at the scheduled time. If special circumstances prevented transport according to the original plan, the materials department should also be notified in advance. The materials department should prepare after receiving the loading and unloading time notification, ensuring timely loading and unloading after the vehicle arrives. From the results of promoting this advanced experience for three months, the results have been significant. Because the problem of waiting for loading and unloading has been resolved, vehicle turnover has greatly increased, and drivers' working hours have decreased from the original 10 hours and 45 minutes to about 9 hours.

    The enterprise's internal work has also been rectified accordingly to ensure the realization of scheduled transport. After the problem of waiting for loading and unloading was resolved, how to ensure a sufficient rate of serviceable vehicles became an urgent problem to be solved. After adjusting the labor organization of maintenance work, the rate of serviceable vehicles has stabilized at over 90%. The implementation of fixed points for passenger buses requires the close cooperation of orderly station services. We summarized and promoted the advanced experience of "pre-selling passenger tickets" in Huang County, solving the problem of selling tickets and handling luggage only when the bus arrives at the station, shortening the stop time by 36%, with individual cases reaching over 50%. Dispatch work is the hub of organizing collaboration, and scientific dispatch work is of great significance for scheduled transport. We summarized the experience of the Wendeng dispatch area in this regard. In addition, we also paid attention to solving some specific problems. For example, we conducted collaborative education for restaurants at intermediate stations, requiring them to ensure that passengers can eat during bus stop times; for certain markets that seriously affected driving speeds and safety, we also migrated them or made other appropriate arrangements through local governments where possible.

    Since the implementation of scheduled transport, according to statistics from the Wendeng dispatch area, except for January of this year when the volume of transport did not meet the plan due to traffic being interrupted by heavy snow for eight days, the plans were overfulfilled in February and March.

    The situation, originally rife with contradictions, has been transformed into a win-win situation for everyone.

    Cargo owners are satisfied: they know when the truck will arrive, allowing them to proactively arrange work. It saves manpower and materials, solving the contradiction between cargo owners and loading and unloading departments. The Wendeng Grain Bureau reported: "With scheduled transport, we no longer have to move grain back and forth." The Wendeng Service Bureau reported: "With timely transport, cabbage will no longer freeze and rot." The Rushan County United Cooperative reported: "In the past, transport was not timely, and we were often criticized. Since the implementation of scheduled transport, fertilizers and water carts have been supplied in a timely manner, and we have been praised by agricultural cooperatives. This credit should be given to the transport company."

    Passengers are satisfied: they no longer have to crowd and queue for a long time to buy tickets, and they don't have to worry about urgent matters or rushing for trains and ships. Passengers reported: "The transport company's style has changed, the buses are like trains, truly good news for passengers."

    Loading and unloading workers are satisfied: they no longer have to wait for loading and unloading, they can rationally use labor, reduce idle work, and increase income. The Wendeng搬運社[搬運社 = transporting organization] originally needed 65 people, now 42 people are enough, increasing work efficiency by about 50%; the Weihai搬運組[搬運組 = transporting group] wrote a letter to the transport company expressing their support for scheduled transport, and actively improving loading and unloading efficiency, reducing the time to load a truck of coal from 13 minutes to 7 minutes.

    Drivers are satisfied: they generally report: "In the past, waiting for loading and unloading was infuriating, now it's really enjoyable to drive as soon as we load up!" "With quotas, there's no need to panic anymore, and safety is guaranteed."

    Station staff are satisfied: scheduled transport not only allows station staff to adjust between busy and slack periods, but also allows them to accurately answer passenger inquiries.

    Dispatchers are satisfied: now that there are reliable quotas to base the compilation of work plans, their greatest satisfaction is that "collaboration has been strengthened, like tightening strands of a rope together, making work easier."

    Changing Style, Initial Success

    In 1950 and 1953, we also tried to implement fixed-schedule and fixed-point passenger bus services twice according to instructions from higher authorities. However, because we did not conduct arduous and detailed investigation and research work, the measures and methods we formulated were largely divorced from reality, thought up by leaders sitting in offices. During the implementation process, we did not follow the mass line, and we lacked ideological and political work, simply relying on administrative orders to implement them, resulting in the failure of both attempts.

    The reason why we were able to promote it relatively smoothly this time, in addition to closely relying on the leadership and support of local party committees and governments, was mainly because we learned from historical lessons, changed our work style and work methods that were divorced from reality and the masses, strengthened political and ideological work, and paid attention to conducting in-depth investigation and research in every work link, discussing solutions with the masses when problems were discovered. For example, at the beginning of the survey, we found that some drivers were nervous, driving erratically, and not operating normally. We adopted the approach of eating, living, and making friends with the workers, integrating with them in life and thought, and constantly listening to their opinions. After we integrated with the workers in life and achieved unity in thoughts and feelings, they changed from being full of doubts about the survey work to actively cooperating, providing many good ideas. The experience of "pre-selling passenger tickets" at Huang County Station was found by tracing clues based on the drivers' reflections.

    In the early stages of promoting fixed-schedule and fixed-point passenger bus services, it was also found that some drivers were undisciplined, feeling that fixed-schedule and fixed-point services were restrictive and not free. Four drivers disrupted scheduled transport by not stopping at the designated dining stations to eat in order to eat cheaper meals. Later, after debates, not only these four drivers, but everyone further clarified in their thinking the principle that individual interests must be subordinate to overall interests.

    Promoting scheduled transport was not smooth sailing. At the beginning, some people, from leading cadres to general employees, expressed doubts, saying: "Our cars are broken," "Buses are not like trains," "Implementing scheduled transport is just waiting to be punished." In order to convince everyone with practical examples, we first selected a group to implement scheduled transport on a daily basis. After five days of testing, the results were good, and 100% of the vehicles arrived at the loading and unloading locations on the dates specified in the plan. At this time, many driving groups automatically followed suit. One month later, according to the workers' requirements, daily scheduled transport was changed to three-hour scheduled transport. After another month of trial implementation, the workers automatically proposed changing from three hours to one hour. Except for individual vehicles with mechanical failures, all of them arrived at the loading and unloading locations on time or ahead of schedule. In this way, scheduled transport was voluntarily promoted by the workers from point to area, and the quality was gradually improved.

    定时运输
    中共烟台汽车运输分公司委员会
    我公司自去年12月全面实行客车定班定点和在文登调度区试行货车定时运输以来，已开始改变了企业的落后面貌，为工农业大跃进提供了更大的运力。
    里里外外，矛盾重重
    在实行定时运输以前，企业内外矛盾重重。外部矛盾主要表现在两个方面。一是承运托运之间的矛盾。因为我们只有五日作业计划，没有汽车到达装卸地点的具体时间，货主不能预作准备，使汽车不能及时装卸，延长了停歇时间；或者货主作好了准备，汽车又不能按期开到，造成了货主人力、物力和时间的浪费，双方互相埋怨。这种矛盾还影响到装卸部门的正常作业，常常因此延误装卸和产生窝工现象，装卸工人对货主和汽车公司都有意见。另一是企业同旅客的矛盾。客车何时发车，何时到站，没有一定的时间，旅客得长时间排队候车，最后也不一定能坐上车，常常因此引起争吵。内部矛盾主要表现在各个生产环节不能很好地衔接。如车辆调度没有完善的定额，编出的五日运行计划准确性差，司机不好执行，少数司机借此随意变动作业计划，失去了计划的严肃性。调度为了完成运输任务，往往不及时调回应入厂保修的车辆，打乱了车队的保养作业计划，而车辆保修拖期出厂，又造成调度工作的被动，往往使运力安排落空。客车停站时间也没有定额，什么时间停车、发车，司机说了算，站长无法指挥。由于没有规定具体作业时间，装卸又不及时，司机为了完成任务，常常抢装抢卸，违犯操作规程，强行超车或阻路不让，大大影响了工人之间的团结和行车安全。
    这些里里外外的矛盾，带来了严重的恶果。首先是使国家浪费了大量的运力。根据我们对货车二百四十七个车日的查定情况来看，因待装待卸所浪费的时间就达一万多分钟，平均每个车日浪费四十一分钟（个别高达三小时之多），按我公司现有一百四十七部货车计算，等于每天停驶十一部货车。又根据对客车查定资料分析，一百零三个车日中因停站时间过长，就浪费了四千多分钟，平均每个车日浪费三十九分钟，按我公司现有七十一部客车计算，等于每天停驶六部客车。
    第二，给货主和装卸部门造成人力、物力的浪费也很严重。举例说，给文登食品公司运毛猪，由于起运时间不定，这个公司每季要浪费十万斤饲料。有些农村粮站把粮食由仓库集中到装卸点待运，也曾因汽车没有按期开来，再由装卸点搬回仓库，这样所造成的人力浪费和粮食消耗是很大的。至于装卸工人等装等卸所造成的窝工损失更无法计算。
    第三，增加了司机的劳动时间。据文登调度区统计，货车司机每日工作时间长达十点四十五分钟，而实际的工作时间只有九个钟头左右，其余时间都浪费在待装待卸、办理手续上面。这是企业内部长期未能解决的一个最尖锐的问题。
    第四，由于没有严格的时间定额，部分司机自由散漫，不服从指挥，违章作业，影响了企业劳动纪律的巩固；同时也增加了事故的因素。
    定时运输，皆大欢喜
    对上述这些矛盾，我们领导上并不是一开始就清醒的。在相当长的时间内，我们仅仅看到司机工作时间过长是我们企业管理中最突出的问题，而对于企业管理落后的实际状况认识不足。在整风运动中，广大职工大量揭发了企业内部各方面的矛盾，要求迅速改变企业管理的落后状况。我们开始认识到这些矛盾的本质是企业内部各个环节和运输企业与物资部门、装卸部门之间协作不好的反映，而协作不好的根本原因又在于我们计划管理落后，计划管理落后的症结又在于没有抓住定时运输这个基本环节。因此要解决企业内外的各种矛盾，必须坚决实行定时运输。定时运输可以促进各方面的协作，而要实现定时运输又必须首先搞好各方面的协作，两者是辩证地互为因果互相推动的。
    为了实行定时运输，我们首先进行了随车写实查定。根据查定资料，制定各种作业时间定额，并按照定额编制出客车定点运行图表和货车的五日运行作业计划。同时，大力加强同货主的协作，与货主签订“装卸责任协议书”，规定运输部门在装卸物资的前一天，通知货主车辆到达的具体时间，并保证按预定时间到达装卸点，如遇特殊情况，不能按原计划运输时，也要事先通知物资部门。物资部门则应在接到装卸时间通知后，作好准备，保证车到后及时装卸。从三个月来推行这一先进经验的结果看，成绩是显著的。由于解决了待装待卸，车辆周转率大为提高，司机工作时间已由原来的十小时四十五分降低到九小时左右。
    企业内部的工作也作了相应的整顿，来保证定时运输的实现。当待装待卸问题解决以后，如何保证有充分的完好车率就成为一个迫切需要解决的问题。经过调整保修工作的劳动组织，完好车率指标已稳定在90％以上。客车实行定点，必须有秩序良好的站务工作密切配合。我们总结推广了黄县预售客票的先进经验，解决了车到站现卖票、现过行李的问题，缩短了停车时间36％，个别达到50％以上。调度工作是组织协作的枢纽，科学的调度工作对定时运输具有重大意义。我们在这方面总结了文登调度区的经验。此外，我们还注意解决了一些具体问题。例如对中间站的饭馆进行协作教育，要求他们能够在汽车停站时间内，保证旅客吃上饭；对某些严重影响行车时速和安全的市集，也通过地方政府在可能条件下迁移或作了其他妥善处理。
    实行定时运输以来，根据文登调度区统计，除今年1月份因大雪交通中断八天因而运量没有完成计划外，2、3月份都超额完成计划。
    原来矛盾重重的局面一变而为皆大欢喜的局面。
    货主满意：什么时候到车心中有数，能够主动安排工作。节约人力、物力，解决了货主与装卸部门的矛盾。文登粮食局反映说：“有了定时运输，再不用把粮食搬来搬去了。”文登服务局反映：“运输及时，白菜再不会冻烂了。”乳山县联社反映说：“过去运输不及时，经常受到责难。实行定时运输以来，化肥、水车供应及时，受到农业社表扬。这个功劳应归于运输公司”。
    旅客满意：买票再不用长时间拥挤排队，有要紧事不用着急，赶火车、轮船也不用心慌。旅客反映说：“运输公司作风转变了，汽车和火车一样，真是旅客的福音。”
    装卸工人满意：再不用等装等卸了，可以合理使用劳动力，减少窝工现象，增加收入。文登搬运社原来六十五个人的工作，现在四十二个人就够用了，提高工作效率50％左右；威海搬运组写信给运输公司表示拥护定时运输，并积极提高装卸效率，装一车煤由十三分钟降为七分钟。
    司机满意：他们普遍反映：“过去待装待卸急死人，现在拉上就跑真痛快！”“有了定额用不着再发慌，安全有保证。”
    站务人员满意：定时运输不仅使站务人员能够调剂忙闲，也可以确切回答旅客询问。
    调度员满意：现在编制作业计划有了可靠的定额作依据，最大的满意则是“加强了协作，八股绳一齐紧，工作好干了”。
    转变作风，旗开得胜
    在1950年和1953年，我们也曾经根据上级的指示试行过两次客车定班定点。但是，由于没有进行艰苦细致的调查研究工作，拟订的一些措施和办法，大都是脱离实际的，是由领导干部坐在办公室想出来的。在进行过程中，又没有走群众路线，更缺乏思想政治工作，只是单纯依靠行政命令贯彻，结果两次推行均告失败。
    这次所以能够比较顺利地推行，除了紧密依靠地方党委和政府的领导与支持以外，主要是接受了历史教训，转变了脱离实际、脱离群众的工作作风和工作方法，加强了政治思想工作，注意了在每一个工作环节上都深入实际进行调查研究，发现问题同群众商量解决。例如在查定开始时，我们发现有些司机精神紧张，驾驶忽快忽慢，作业不够正常。我们采取了同工人同吃、同住、交朋友的做法，在生活上、思想上同他们打成一片，随时注意听取他们的意见。当我们同工人在生活上打成一片，在思想感情上融洽一致之后，他们对查定工作便由疑虑重重变为主动配合，提供了许多好办法。黄县车站“预售客票”的经验，就是根据司机反映的情况找到线索的。
    在推行客车定班定点的初期，又发现有些司机自由散漫，感到定班定点受约束，不自由。有四个司机为了贪图吃便宜饭，不在规定的就餐站停车吃饭，打乱了定点运输。后来经过辩论，不但这四个司机，而且大家在思想上都进一步明确了个人利益服从整体利益的道理。
    推行定时运输并不是一帆风顺的。开始，从领导干部到一般职工还有一部分人表示怀疑，他们说：“我们的车破”，“汽车不比火车”“实行定时运输只有等着挨罚”。为了用实际事例说服大家，我们首先选择了一个小组，实行按日的定期运输。经过五天试验，效果良好，百分之百的车辆都按计划规定的日期到达装卸地点。这时，就有不少的驾驶小组自动仿行。一个月后，根据工人的要求，将按日的定期运输改为三小时的定时运输。又经过一个月的试行，工人自动提出由三小时改为一小时。除个别车辆发生机件故障外，全部都作到准时或提前到达装卸地点。这样，定时运输就由点到面为工人自觉自愿地推行起来，并逐步提高了质量。
