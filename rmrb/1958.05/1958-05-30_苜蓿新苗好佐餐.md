Alfalfa Sprouts are a Good Side Dish
Yang Min

    I used to think that alfalfa was just a wild flower. After liberation, when I went to the Northeast, I saw alfalfa planted in many places, often covering the mountains and plains, stretching as far as the eye could see. The scene was truly "Yellow flowers bloom spontaneously, stirring the grazing cattle on the slopes" (a line from Song Dynasty poet Mei Yaochen). Even in the relatively cold areas north of the Nen River, alfalfa was planted everywhere and grew very well. I then learned that alfalfa has many uses. First, it is an excellent feed, not only for horses, but also, if made into dry feed, very suitable for feeding pigs and cattle. Second, like soybeans, purple clover, and other plants, its root system has nodules that can absorb nitrogen from the air, so it is also a good green manure. It is said that in 1954, the Xizhanggeng Cooperative in Jieyu County, Shanxi, planted sweet potatoes in fields where alfalfa had been planted without applying any other fertilizer, and the yield reached as much as 7,000 catties per mu. They also planted sweet potatoes in fields where alfalfa had not been planted, applying one and a half cartloads of other fertilizers, but the yield was only about 3,000 catties. The fertilizer effect of alfalfa is evident from this. Third, the roots of alfalfa grow quite thick, and can be dug up and used as firewood if necessary. Fourth, planting alfalfa can also increase the porosity and granulation of the soil, thus helping to conserve moisture and prevent soil erosion. Fifth, alfalfa has been used as a Chinese medicine since ancient times. The "Nong Zheng Quan Shu" of the Ming Dynasty says it "benefits the large and small intestines," and the "Compendium of Materia Medica" says it "benefits the five internal organs, removes evil qi from the spleen and stomach, and treats red eyes and painful urinary stones," etc. This is worthy of in-depth study by medical scientists. Sixth, and particularly worth mentioning, it is edible. The tender leaves of alfalfa can be used as vegetables, commonly known as golden flower vegetable, grass head, or panqi head. Its seeds can be used as food. The ancient name "mu su" was derived from the fact that it could be used for cooking rice. Li Shizhen, a great physician of the Ming Dynasty, also said that these seeds can be used to make wine, which is also worth trying by people today.
    The nutritional value of alfalfa is very considerable. If an adult engaged in moderate physical labor eats half a catty of alfalfa a day, the calcium intake is sufficient (and several times more than from other vegetables), although phosphorus and protein are insufficient. Iron intake will be a little high. If considering the intake of carotene and vitamin C alone, two ounces of alfalfa a day is sufficient. Spinach and carrots are known for being rich in nutrients, but compared to alfalfa, they are far behind.
    According to legend, alfalfa was first brought from the Western Regions (now Xinjiang) to Luoyang by Zhang Qian of the Han Dynasty for cultivation and development. Zhang Qian went to the Western Regions with the aim of obtaining good horses from Dayuan (now Hetian). But the horses there liked to eat alfalfa, so he had to bring alfalfa back with him. By the Jin Dynasty, Hua Qiao's alfalfa garden was already "very well organized," on a considerable scale. However, it seemed to be planted only as feed for horses. By the Tang Dynasty, people were already eating it, but it seemed to be looked down upon by the scholar-officials. Xue Lingzhi of the Tang Dynasty wrote a self-pitying poem saying: "The morning sun rises round and round, shining on Mr.'s plate, what is on the plate? Alfalfa grows rampant! The rice is rough and difficult to pick up with a spoon, the soup is thin and the tendons are easily loosened. With nothing to plan for morning and evening, how can I ensure a warm year!" By the Song Dynasty, more people were eating it, and Lu You wrote in a poem: "Don't laugh at my poverty for the alfalfa piled on the plate." Now, alfalfa has been widely planted in Northeast, Northwest, and North China.

    苜蓿新苗好佐餐
    杨旻
    我先前一直认为苜蓿不过是闲花野草。解放后到东北，见很多地方种植苜蓿，常常漫山遍野，一望无际。那盛况，真是“黄花今自发，撩乱牧牛陂”（宋梅尧臣诗句）。就是在比较严寒的嫩江以北地区，也到处种着苜蓿，而且生长得很好。我这才了解到，苜蓿的用途很多。一，它是上好的饲料，不但可以饲马，如果制成干料，也很适于喂猪和牛。二，和大豆、紫云英等植物一样，它的根系上有根瘤，能吸收空气中的氮素，所以又是一种很好的绿肥。据说1954年山西解虞县西张耿社在种过苜蓿的地里种上甘薯，并没有施其他肥料，每亩收获竟达七千斤之多；又在没有种过苜蓿的地里种了甘薯，施了一车半其他肥料，收获却只有三千来斤。苜蓿的肥效，由此可见。三，苜蓿的根长得相当粗大，必要时可以把它翻出来当柴烧。四，种植苜蓿还可以增加土壤的孔隙和团粒，因此又有保蓄水分、防止水土流失的作用。五，苜蓿自古还当中药用。明朝的农政全书说它“利大小肠”，本草纲目说它“利五脏、去脾胃邪气，治目赤及沙石淋痛”等。这是值得医学家深入研究的。六，特别值得一提的用途，是可吃。苜蓿的嫩叶可当蔬菜，俗称金花菜、草头、盘歧头便是。它的种子，可当饭，古种“木粟”，就是取它可以炊饭的意思。我国明代大医药家李时珍还说这种子可以酿酒，这也值得今人试行。
    苜蓿的营养价值非常可观。一个进行中等体力劳动的成年人，如果一天吃半市斤苜蓿，除磷和蛋白质不足以外（但比从其他蔬菜中摄取的还是要多好几倍），钙已足够需要，铁还嫌多了一点；如果单就摄取胡萝卜素和维生素丙来说，一天只要吃二两苜蓿就足够了。菠菜、胡萝卜是以养分多著称的，可是和苜蓿比起来，却是望尘莫及。
    据传说，苜蓿最初是汉朝张骞从西域（现在的新疆）带到洛阳种植发展起来的。张骞去西域，目的是要得到大宛（现在的和阗）的良马。但那里的马喜欢吃苜蓿。所以他不得不同时把苜蓿带回。到晋朝，华?种植的苜蓿园，已经“阡陌甚整”，很具规模了。不过似乎都只是当作马的饲料来种植的。到唐朝，人也已经吃它了，但似乎很为士大夫之流所不屑，当朝薛令子曾做一首自悼诗说：“朝日上团团，照见先生盘，盘中何所有？苜蓿长阑干！饭涩匙难绾，羹稀筋易宽。无以谋朝夕，何由保岁寒！”到宋朝，吃的人多了，陆游有诗道：“苜蓿堆盘莫笑贫”。现在，我国东北、西北、华北，都已经非常广泛地种植了。
