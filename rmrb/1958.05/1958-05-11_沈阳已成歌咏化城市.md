　　Shenyang Has Become a Singing City

　　During the "May Day" holiday, Shenyang has become a singing city. Among the city's 2.4 million population, 1,445,000 people can sing socialist songs, accounting for 60.5% of the city's total population.

　　Among the masses participating in singing, in addition to students, workers, and government cadres, there are also elderly women, elderly men, old professors, cooks, etc. Some are three-generation choirs, and even nuns and monks in religious circles have begun to sing socialist songs.

　　On "May Day", more than 300,000 parading crowds and visiting masses sang songs such as "Socialism is Good," "Revolutionary People," and "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind." The singing was continuous, rising and falling, forming an ocean of songs.

　　沈阳已成歌咏化城市
    沈阳市在“五一”节时，已形成一个歌咏化城市，全市二百四十万人口中，已有一百四十四万五千人会唱社会主义歌曲，占全市总人数的60.5％。
    参加唱歌的群众中，除学生、工人、机关干部外，还有老大娘、老大爷、老教授、炊事员等，有的是老少三辈的合唱团，连宗教界的尼姑、和尚等也唱起了社会主义歌曲。
    在“五一”节那天，三十多万游行队伍和参观的群众唱着“社会主义好“、“革命人”、“东风压倒西风”等歌曲，歌声连成一片，此起彼伏，形成了歌唱的海洋。
