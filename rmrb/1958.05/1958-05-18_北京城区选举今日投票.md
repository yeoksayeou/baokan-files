Xinhua News Agency, 17th: Beijing's districts will hold elections for district people's representatives on the 18th. In recent days, many factories, government offices, and stores have hung huge banners welcoming the general election. In streets and alleys, almost every household has posted Spring Festival couplets celebrating the general election, creating a joyous atmosphere throughout the city.

    The districts of Beijing began establishing election committees in January to prepare for this year's elections. The election of people's representatives in the suburban townships (towns) was completed on the 10th. According to the Beijing Municipal Election Committee, the voter turnout in the original seven suburban districts reached 97.1%, an increase of 1.23% compared to the previous election in these districts. Many constituencies had a 100% voter turnout. Elections for district-level people's representatives in the suburbs will also be held soon.

    The capital's districts have already nominated 1,475 district representative candidates, including people from all walks of life. These candidates were carefully selected by voters through the democratic forms of airing views, speaking out freely, and engaging in extensive debate, thoroughly implementing the spirit of rectification. Voters put forward the idea of electing promoters and not demoters in big-character posters and meetings, and carefully compared and contrasted the proposed representative candidates in terms of politics, production, work, representativeness, and mass relations. In the two constituencies of the Xinjiekou North Street Office in the Xisi District, voters posted more than 10,000 big-character posters. Many of these posters used the voters' personal experiences to compare the old and new societies, illustrating that only the election system of the new society is a truly democratic system. Many posters also offered praise and criticism of the previous representatives and this year's representative candidates. For example, more than 520 posters were about the previous district representative, Chen Dazhang. The voters in this street loved this representative who faithfully served the people, praising his strengths while also criticizing his shortcomings.

　　北京城区选举今日投票
    新华社17日讯　北京城区18日将投票选举区人民代表。这几天，许多工厂、机关、商店高高挂起了迎接普选的巨幅标语，在街头里巷，几乎家家户户都贴出了欢庆普选的门联，全城到处都是一片欢乐的景象。
    北京全市各区从1月份开始分别成立了选举委员会筹备今年的选举工作。郊区各乡（镇）人民代表的选举工作已经在10日全部结束。据市选举委员会公布，原郊区七个区在京选民参加投票的达97.1％，比这些区上届选民参加选举的比例提高了1.23％，许多选区的选民百分之百地参加了投票。郊区区一级人民代表的选举也将在最近举行。
    首都各城区目前已经推选出包括各阶层人民的区代表候选人一千四百七十五人。这些候选人都是选民们认真地贯彻整风精神，通过大鸣大放、大争大辩的民主形式挑选出来的。选民们在大字报上、会上提出要选促进派不选促退派，并且对各方面提出来的代表候选人进行了比政治、比生产、比工作、比代表性和比群众关系的认真评比。西四区新街口北大街办事处两个选区的选民贴了一万多张大字报，有许多大字报是选民以自己亲身的经历来作新旧社会的对比，说明只有新社会的选举制度才是真正的民主制度，也有许多大字报对上届代表和这一次的代表候选人提出了表扬和批评，例如其中有五百二十多张的大字报是对上届区代表陈大章贴的，这个街的选民热爱这位忠心地为人民服务的代表，表扬了他的优点，同时也对他的缺点提出了批评。
