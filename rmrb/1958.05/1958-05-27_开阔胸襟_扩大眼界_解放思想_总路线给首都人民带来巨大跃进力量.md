Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: The victorious conclusion of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China and the general line for socialist construction formulated by the meeting have brought tremendous leap forward strength to the people of the capital.

    The Beijing Cotton Textile Factory Workers Held a Meeting Overnight to Change Single Production to Multi-Variety Production

    Zong Ting, the Secretary of the CPC Committee of the Beijing Cotton Textile United Factory, was a representative to the "Eighth National Congress." On the 25th and 26th, he conveyed the main content and spirit of the meeting to more than 1,000 cadres in the factory. After hearing the report, the cadres and engineering technicians of the No. 1 Weaving Workshop were extremely excited. They held a meeting overnight and formulated a concrete plan for the issue of transforming the original single weaving workshop into a workshop producing multiple varieties of cloth, which was already under consideration. They guaranteed that within this year, they would not ask the state for a single penny to transform the single production of the weaving workshop into a workshop capable of producing various colored cloths.

    To Plant the Red Flag on the Top of the Mountain
    Jingxi Mine Determined to Catch Up with Jiaozuo Mine

    Wang Qiufang, the Secretary of the CPC Committee of the Jingxi Mining Bureau, who attended the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress" as a non-voting delegate, conveyed the spirit of the meeting at the CPC Committee of the Jingxi Mining Bureau on the 25th. Everyone unanimously believed that although great progress had been made in catching up with the Huainan Mine in the past five months, with the daily output increasing from an average of more than 7,000 tons to more than 10,000 tons, compared with the most advanced Jiaozuo Coal Mine, this was still small thinking and small efforts, merely planting the red flag on the mountainside. Now, they have decided to plant the red flag on the top of the mountain and catch up with the most advanced Jiaozuo Coal Mine. The meeting decided to immediately organize all the mine's employees to study the documents of the Second Session of the "Eighth National Congress," take measures to catch up with the Huainan Mine ahead of schedule, and catch up with the Jiaozuo Mine in the second half of the year.

    After listening to the report on the spirit of the meeting conveyed by Wang Jingming, the Secretary of the District Committee and representative to the "Eighth National Congress," the Party Secretaries and Agricultural Cooperative Directors of various townships in Fengtai District, during the discussion, all believed that the general line for socialist construction broadened people's minds, expanded their horizons, and liberated their thinking. Township and cooperative cadres have put forward new leap forward targets and measures. The Xiaotun Agricultural Cooperative plans to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for its 2,000 mu of wheat next year. The guaranteed measures are deep plowing of more than one chi, improving the soil, adopting all superior varieties, and densely planting no less than 600,000 plants per mu.

    The CPC Xuanwu District Committee convened three meetings today, attended by the leaders of mutual aid groups in the industrial system, branch secretaries in the commercial system, and principals and branch secretaries of secondary schools, to study how to better implement the general line for socialist construction. The meeting of the leaders of mutual aid groups in the industrial system decided to convene meetings of leading cadres, technical personnel, and all employees of various factories within this week to study issues such as further leaps in production, trial production of a large number of new products, and cooperation between factories and industries.
