Breaking the Mystique of Science
    Liquan Establishes Agricultural Science Research Institute
    Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative Establishes Scientific Research Office

    (Our report) According to the Shaanxi Daily, Shaanxi Province's first agricultural science research institution established by a county—the Liquan County Agricultural Science Research Institute—was officially established on May 17, based on the liberation of thought and the breaking of the mystique surrounding scientific and technological work.

    This research institute will focus on agricultural research. Its tasks are: to help cadres cultivate experimental fields well, to summarize the rich harvest experiences of the masses in the county, to conduct special studies in conjunction with these experiences, to solve key problems in field production, and to serve the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. In order to welcome the county's water conservancy efforts, the research institute is also preparing to study a series of scientific and technological problems such as land leveling and rational irrigation.

    In the process of researching and establishing the Agricultural Science Research Institute, the Liquan County Committee of the Communist Party of China conducted repeated deliberation and discussion on why to engage in science and whether it could be done. After concrete analysis, they believed that due to the development of the great leap forward in production, general technical guidance like in the past could no longer continuously improve production, and the masses could no longer be satisfied with general technical guidance. Without engaging in science, it would be impossible to lead the masses to learn science and technology, so that production could leap forward again and again. So could it be done? They believed that now cadres throughout the county were engaging in experimental fields and the masses were engaging in high-yield fields, which had become a trend. As long as it was developed and improved, it could be combined with scientific research. Most of the existing technical cadres in the county have a certain amount of scientific and technological theoretical knowledge, coupled with the help of teachers and students from the Northwest Agricultural College stationed in Liquan. As long as the mystique is broken, it is entirely feasible for the county to run its own scientific research undertaking.

    After discussion, it was decided to immediately establish the Agricultural Science Research Institute, with Sun Mingcai, Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee, concurrently serving as the Director of the Institute. Nine members of the institute affairs committee are concurrently held by Party, government, and relevant responsible comrades and technical cadres, including Wang Baojing, Director of the Scientific Research Office of the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative. The research institute will have an indoor and outdoor agricultural exhibition hall, a meteorological station, and a mass experience research office, and will establish four experimental sites.

    At the founding conference of the research institute, Liang Dezhu, Secretary-General of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yu Qibao, Director of the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, Li Ting, Deputy Director, and Kang Di, Vice President of Northwest Agricultural College, and Professor Zhao Hongzhang all expressed their support and congratulations.

    (Our report) Reporter Liu Bin reports: The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative in Liquan County, Shaanxi, has recently established a scientific research office on the basis of carrying out mass learning activities in agricultural science and technology. Now, under the leadership of Wang Baojing, director of the cooperative, this research office is launching scientific research activities.

    Recently, the Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative has been carrying out various scientific cultivation and high-yield experiments. In one mu of land, there is a comparison of 112 varieties of wheat using hybridization and other technologies; in another mu of land, there is a comparative experiment of different sowing periods, fertilization, land preparation, close planting, irrigation, frequency of pest control, seed treatment, soil disinfection, rotation, and continuous cropping. There are experiments on cotton seedling cultivation in nutrient pots for wheat and cotton double cropping, direct seeding, and wheat and cotton intercropping, as well as experiments using intercropping to achieve a yield of 5,500 jin of grain per mu. The cooperative is conducting scientific cultivation and high-yield experiments on about 300 mu of land in total.

    "People increase knowledge, and the land increases production," is a resounding slogan put forward by the members this year. This year, the cooperative plans to achieve an average yield of 1,000 jin per mu for grain crops and 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In order to complete this target, the leaders of the cooperative and the masses have researched and determined many measures for implementing scientific cultivation and reform. They have also signed a guarantee of teaching and learning contract for studying science and technology with the Northwest Agricultural College, and have established a long-term amateur elementary class and advanced class, planning to enable all members over the age of eighteen to learn scientific cultivation techniques for various crops in the shortest possible time.

    In the past, with the help of agricultural technicians and Northwest Agricultural College, the cooperative carried out a series of scientific and technological reforms in agricultural cultivation, and achieved great success in cultivating varieties of wheat and corn. After several years of practice, science and technology have taken root in the minds of the masses, liberating their thinking; and accumulated a lot of experience, which laid the mass foundation and ideological foundation for the establishment of the scientific research office. The Fenghuo Agricultural Cooperative has the following three experiences in carrying out mass agricultural science and technology learning activities:

    (1) Closely integrate with production and solve the urgent problems that need to be solved in increasing production at all times. For example, in the past, corn was replanted after the wheat harvest, and it was sown with hard stubble, causing the corn to lodge and the yield to be very low. They then adopted scientific cultivation methods, and after experiments, changed to sowing with soft stubble, deep plowing and then opening ditches for sowing, and adopted rational close planting, selection of good varieties, and prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.

    (2) Everything is tested, and living facts are used to educate the masses, and then promoted first in the youth production team, and then promoted to the large fields. For example, some people did not believe in corn detasseling and hybridization at first, so they did comparative experiments. As a result, one increased production, and the other had a lower yield. Subsequently, it was first done in the youth production team, and the yield was also higher than other production teams. In this way, under the education of facts, various scientific and technological measures were quickly implemented.

    (3) Established a certain organization and system. The cooperative established a technical section, and each production team established a technical research group, so that there was a special person responsible for the promotion of each scientific technology. At the same time, an incentive system was also established. This greatly stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses to learn scientific cultivation techniques.

    打破对科学的神秘观念
    醴泉成立农业科学研究所
    烽火农业社建立科学研究室
    本报讯　据陕西日报消息：陕西省第一所由县举办的农业科学研究机构——醴泉县农业科学研究所，在解放思想、打破了对科学技术工作的神秘观念的基础上于5月17日正式成立。
    这个研究所以研究农业为主。它的任务是：帮助干部种好试验田，以总结本县群众丰产经验为主，结合进行专题研究，解决大田生产中的关键性问题，为农业生产的不断跃进服务。为了迎接全县水利化，研究所还准备研究平整土地、合理灌溉等一系列的科学技术问题。
    中共醴泉县委在研究建立农业科学研究所的过程中，对为什么要办科学，能不能办科学，曾进行了反复酝酿讨论。经过具体分析，他们认为由于生产大跃进的形势发展，像过去那样一般地进行技术指导，就不能使生产不断提高，而且群众对于一般性的技术指导已经不能满足，不办科学，就无法领导群众人人学科学、人人学技术，使生产跃进再跃进。那么能不能办呢？他们认为现在全县干部搞试验田，群众搞丰产田已成了风气，只要把它发展一下，提高一步，完全可以结合起来进行科学研究。全县现有的技术干部，大都具有一定的科学技术理论知识，加上西北农学院下放在醴泉的教师和同学的帮助，只要打破神秘观念，县自办科学研究事业是完全可行的。
    经过讨论，决定立即建立农业科学研究所；由县委副书记孙明才兼任研究所所长，九个所务委员由党、政和有关负责同志、技术干部兼任，其中还有烽火农业社科学研究室主任王保京。研究所下设室内室外农览馆、气象台、群众经验研究室，建立四个试验点。
    在研究所成立大会上，中国科学院陕西分院秘书长梁得柱、陕西省农业科学研究所所长俞启葆、副所长李挺、西北农学院副院长康迪和赵洪璋教授都表示支持和祝贺。
    本报讯　记者刘斌报道：陕西醴泉县烽火农业社在开展群众性的学习农业科学技术活动的基础上，最近成立了科学研究室。现在，这个研究室在社主任王保京的领导下正展开科学研究活动。
    最近，烽火农业社在实行着各种各样的科学耕作丰产试验。在一亩地里是112种小麦品种杂交等技术的对比；另一亩地里是不同的播
  种期、施肥、整地、密植、灌溉、治虫次数、种籽处理、土壤消毒、轮作和连作等科学耕作的对比试验。有麦棉两熟的棉花营养钵育苗、直播和麦棉套种的试验，也有用套种达到亩产五千五百斤粮食的试验。全社进行科学耕作丰产试验的共有三百亩地左右。
    “人增知识，地增产”，这是社员们今年提出的响亮口号。今年，这个社计划粮食作物平均亩产要达到一千斤，棉花达到一百斤皮棉。为了完成这个指标，社的领导上和群众研究确定了许多实行科学耕作改革的措施。他们还和西北农学院签订了学习科学技术的保教保学合同，成立了一个长期业余初级班和高级班，计划在最短期间内使所有十八岁以上的社员，全部学会各项作物科学耕作技术。
    过去，这个社在农业技术干部和西北农学院帮助下，进行了一系列的农业耕作科学技术改革，在培育小麦和玉米等品种方面取得了很大成绩。经过几年的实践，科学技术已经在群众的思想上扎了根，解放了群众的思想；还积累了不少经验，这就有了成立科学研究室的群众基础和思想基础。烽火农业社在开展群众性的学习农业科学技术活动中，有下列三点经验：
    （一）密切结合生产，解决各个时间增产中迫切需要解决的问题。如过去麦收后回槎玉米，都是硬槎播种，玉米倒伏，产量很低。他们便采用科学耕作办法，经过试验，改为软槎播种，深耕后再开沟播种，并采用合理密植、选用良种、防治病虫害等科学技术。
    （二）一切经过试验，用活生生的事实教育群众，然后先在青年生产队推广，再向大田中推广。如有的人开始不相信玉米去雄杂交，他们便作对比试验，结果一个增产，另一个产量少。随后，又在青年生产队先作，产量也都比其他生产队的高。这样，在事实的教育下，各项科学技术很快推行了。
    （三）建立了一定组织和制度。社内成立了技术股，各生产队又建立了技术研究小组，使推广每一项科学技术都有专人负责。同时，还建立了奖励制度。这样就大大激发了群众学习科学耕作技术的热情。
