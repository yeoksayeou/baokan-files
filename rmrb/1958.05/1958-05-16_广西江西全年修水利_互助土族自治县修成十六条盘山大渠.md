Xinhua News Agency, Nanning: The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Water Conservancy Conference, held from the 3rd to the 10th, determined the principles and tasks for water conservancy construction this winter and next spring.

　　The autonomous region achieved great success in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring. As of the end of April, the region had completed more than 135,200 water conservancy projects, irrigating more than 9.9 million mu of land. The quality of the projects was generally very good. According to inspections of more than 21,000 water conservancy projects in 24 counties, 93.9% met the standards. More than 17,000 ponds and wells were dug in the rocky mountain areas, solving the water needs of 370,000 people and the drinking water problems of more than 340,000 livestock. However, there were also some shortcomings, mainly that some areas did not pay enough attention to the use of river water. Some reservoirs built last winter and this spring lacked water sources due to prolonged drought, so they could not exert their irrigation effectiveness in the current spring drought situation.

　　Based on the development patterns of drought in Guangxi over the years, the distribution of rivers in various parts of the region, and the experiences and lessons learned from water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, the conference decided that the focus of water conservancy construction this winter and next spring should be on rivers with long-term water flow. Areas without rivers should develop underground spring water, followed by impounding rainwater. From now until next spring, the region's water conservancy construction must complete the task of irrigating 20 million mu of land. Combined with the approximately 15 million mu of land that already has water conservancy facilities, and after these water conservancy facilities are improved, it is estimated that more than 30 million mu of cultivated land in the region can basically eliminate drought by the time of next spring plowing.

　　The conference demanded that all localities should take action from now on, formulate comprehensive plans, prepare materials, tools, and other preparations, and implement the principle of "minor repairs during busy seasons, major repairs during less busy seasons, and full repairs during off-seasons" for year-round water conservancy repairs. In the current movement to fight drought and protect seedlings, drought resistance should be combined with water conservancy construction.

　　This newspaper reports: The Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee recently jointly convened a provincial water conservancy work conference, summarized the experiences of the water conservancy construction movement last winter and this spring, put forward new water conservancy construction tasks, and demanded that all localities continue their efforts and implement water conservancy construction throughout the year.

　　Jiangxi Province's water conservancy construction plan for last winter and this spring has been successfully completed. The quality of more than 90% of the projects is very good, and 51.5% of the province's total paddy field area already has drought resistance capabilities for more than fifty days.

　　The conference summarized the rich experiences of water conservancy construction in different regions, and based on these experiences, affirmed the different measures and methods that should be taken to achieve water conservancy in different regions in the future: First, in mountainous areas, plant trees and grass, close mountains for afforestation, and dig pits to block sand to control soil erosion; at the same time, build a large number of reservoirs and dams to block and store water at every level, so as to control mountain floods in the rainy season and divert water to resist drought. Second, in hilly areas, where there are many gullies and few streams and insufficient water sources, measures should be taken to build reservoirs at every ridge, block water to build dams, and dig ponds wherever there are depressions, to universally build small mountain ponds and reservoirs, so that reservoirs and ponds are connected, ditches and canals are connected, water is stored separately, and irrigation is unified, in order to eliminate drought. Third, in the plains and lake areas, comprehensive measures should be mainly taken to block the sea and build dams, dig land to enclose lakes, dig ponds and wells, cultivate embankments and build闸, and open ditches for storage and drainage to eliminate flood and drought disasters.

　　The conference formulated a plan for water conservancy construction this year, requiring that all paddy fields can resist drought for more than fifty days, and that flood disasters are basically eliminated in the areas along rivers and lakes.

　　To achieve this plan, the conference believes that in addition to continuing to fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, go all out, and implement the construction line of more, faster, better, and more economical, water conservancy construction must be implemented throughout the year, changing the past phenomenon of only concentrating on water conservancy construction during the winter and spring seasons.

　　This newspaper reports: The people of all ethnic groups in the Mutual Help Tu Autonomous County on the Qinghai Plateau used 35 days to build 16 large trunk canals, higher than Mount Hua, the highest of the Five Great Mountains, and 2,000 kilometers long, coiled around the mountains, which have already released water on May 1st; the Tu, Han, Tibetan, and Hui people of the autonomous county are no longer afraid of the threat of drought.

　　The Mutual Help Tu Autonomous County is located on the southern foot of the Qilian Mountains, with high altitude and cold climate, and little wind and rain. The biggest enemies of the people's production and life are drought. At the beginning of spring plowing, the autonomous county experienced drought again. Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups launched a mass anti-drought and water conservancy climax to achieve a great leap forward in agricultural production. After 35 days of hard work, all of the county's 1.12 million mu of cultivated land, except for 320,000 mu of irrigated land and high-mountain rainy land, all mountain dry land and flat dry land have been turned into irrigated land.

　　From March 26th, the construction of 16 trunk canals started in full swing, and the drilling of wells in the river water also progressed simultaneously.

　　The locations of these canals are all at an altitude of 2,540 meters to 2,940 meters above sea level, like sixteen long dragons flying in the air with the mountains, passing through a total of 272 mountain peaks, crossing 161 ravines, and crossing 44 "Yahe" (depressions between two mountains). The earth and stone dug and filled, stacked one by one, are as long as two Yellow Rivers. What is especially valuable is that such difficult and complex projects were all designed and built by the masses. Due to the in-depth mobilization of the masses and the resolute reliance on the masses, the progress of the project was like a broken bamboo, and 1,000 kilometers of trunk canals and 1,800 kilometers of branch canals were built in 35 days, and hundreds of wells were drilled. The quality of the project was good, and it only cost 30 cents to turn one mu of dry land into irrigated land, truly achieving more, faster, better, and more economical. (Yang Liben)

　　广西江西全年修水利
    互助土族自治县修成十六条盘山大渠
    据新华社南宁讯　从3日到10日举行的广西僮族自治区水利会议，决定了今冬明春兴修水利的方针和任务。
    自治区去冬今春的水利建设取得巨大成绩。到4月底止，全区水利完工已达十三万五千二百多处，灌溉面积达九百九十多万亩。工程质量一般很好，据二十四个县两万一千多处水利工程检查结果，合规格的占93.9％。在石山地区挖塘打井一万七千多处，解决了三十七万人的用水和三十四万多头牲畜的饮水问题。但是也存在一些缺点，主要是在部分地区对利用河水没有引起足够重视。去冬今春修筑的一部分水库，由于天久不雨，缺乏水源，以至在当前春旱情况下不能发挥灌溉效能。
    会议根据广西历年干旱发展规律和境内各地河流的分布情况，以及去冬今春兴修水利的经验教训，决定今冬明春水利建设重点放在有长流水的河道上，无河道的地区要开发地下泉水，其次是拦蓄天水。从现在到明年春季，全区兴修水利要完成灌溉两千万亩的任务，再加上目前约计有一千五百万亩左右已有水利设施，这些水利设施经过改善，预计到明年春耕期间，全区有三千多万亩耕地可基本消灭旱灾。
    会议要求从现在起，各地就应该行动起来，订出全面规划，作好物资、工具等各项准备工作，实行“小忙大修、大忙小修、不忙全修”常年修水利的方针。在当前抗旱保苗运动中，要把抗旱与修水利结合起来。
    本报讯　中共江西省委和江西省人民委员会最近联合召开全省水利工作会议，总结了去冬今春兴修水利运动的经验，提出了新的水利建设任务，要求各地再接再厉，把水利建设贯彻全年。
    江西省去冬今春的兴修水利计划已经胜利完成，工程90％以上的质量都很好，全省总面积51.5％的水田已经具备了五十天以上的抗旱能力。
    会议总结了不同地区兴修水利的丰富经验，并根据这些经验肯定了今后在不同地区实现水利化所应采取的不同措施和办法：第一，在山区植树种草、封山育林和挖坑拦沙，控制水土流失；同时大量建造水库、修筑坝堰，节节拦水蓄水，以控制雨季山洪暴发，并引水抗旱。第二，丘陵地区，沟多溪少，水源不足，应采取逢垅建库、逼水扎坝、见窝挖塘的办法，普遍兴修小型山塘水库，做到库塘相连、沟渠相通、分散蓄水、统一灌溉，以消灭旱灾。第三，平原滨湖地区，主要采取拦海扎坝，挖地围湖、挖塘打井、培圩建闸、开沟蓄泄的综合措施来消灭旱涝灾害。
    会议制订了今年兴修水利的计划，要求达到全部水田都可以抗旱五十天以上，沿河滨湖地区基本上消灭水涝灾害。
    实现这个计划，会议认为，除了继续充分发动群众、依靠群众，鼓足干劲，贯彻多、快、好、省的建设路线外，必须把水利建设贯彻全年，改变过去只集中在冬春两季突击修水利的现象。　（马锺明）
    本报讯　青海高原上的互助土族自治县各族人民用三十五天修成的十六条比五岳中最高的华山还高、全长二千公里的蟠卧在丛山峻岭中的大干渠，已经在5月1日放水；自治县的土族和汉藏回族人民从此不再惧怕干旱的威胁。
    互助土族自治县在祁连山南麓，地势高寒，风多雨少，人民生产上和生活上的最大敌人就是干旱。春耕开始，自治县又发生了旱象，各族人民在党的领导下，为实现农业生产大跃进掀起了全民性的抗旱和水利化高潮。经过三十五天苦战，使全县一百一十二万亩耕地除了三十二万亩水地和高山多雨地，全部山旱地和平旱地都变成了水浇地。
    从3月26日起，十六条干渠全面开工，川水打井也齐头并进。
    这些渠道的位置都在拔海二五四零公尺到二九四零公尺，好像十六条长龙随着山势在半空飞舞，共经过二百七十二座山头，跨过一百六十一条沟壑，渡过四十四个“牙合”（两山之间的凹部），挖填的土石方一方一方垒起来，有两条黄河那样长。尤其可贵的是这样艰巨复杂的工程，都是群众定线群众修的。由于深入发动了群众，坚决依靠了群众，工程进度势如破竹，三十五天便修好了一千公里干渠和一千八百公里支渠，打了几百口井，工程质量良好，一亩旱地变水地只花三角钱，真正做到了多快好省。
