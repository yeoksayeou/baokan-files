Xinhua News Agency, 6th. The National Agricultural Tool Exhibition continued to receive visitors from central and Beijing municipal agencies, organizations, schools, and foreign guests today.

Shen Junru, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, and Shi Liang, Minister of Justice, also visited the exhibition.

The representatives attending meetings in Beijing from various regions were the most meticulous in their viewing. Many have been watching since the preview and are still watching now. Cadres and farmers from Anhui, Henan, Hubei, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Jiangxi and other provinces who brought agricultural tools to participate in the exhibition also engaged in extensive learning. Zhang Guangyi, a farmer from Dengfeng County, Henan, paid close attention to the water lifting, transportation, and processing tools created in various regions. He sketched two new agricultural tools in one day. Another representative from Shaanxi Province has already drawn more than a dozen sketches.

Today, Shen Junru, Peng Dehuai, Shi Liang, and others all watched very carefully and became more and more excited as they watched. In the agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery hall, they attached great importance to the creations of the masses and asked the narrators or inventors themselves for detailed information. After listening to the explanations, they shook hands with them to express their thanks.

This newspaper reports that in the fields north of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition Hall Square, China's newly made hand-held tractors, Satellite brand 56-type crawler tractors, and double-layered deep plows created by Changge County, Henan, were demonstrated to the audience.

In the future, the various tractors on display at the exhibition, the important agricultural tools invented by farmers, and some of the recently renovated and created tillage machinery from various regions will be demonstrated to the audience in actual farming operations in turn.

The characteristic of this exhibition is not only to display the new things that workers and peasants have transformed and created in the current national agricultural tool reform movement, but also to enable the audience to truly see the actual effects of these new things, so that they can learn and exchange experiences. Therefore, this exhibition attaches great importance to operation. Everything that can be demonstrated will be demonstrated, and the inventors and creators will be allowed to perform the demonstrations themselves as much as possible. Even things that are not perfect will be demonstrated in order to absorb opinions from all parties and make further improvements.

In addition to a large performance area dedicated to tillage machinery, most of the irrigation and drainage tools, water conservancy construction tools, and fixed power machinery are not simply displayed, but are being demonstrated at all times. For example, biogas lighting, wind power generation, feed grinders, and flour mills are all being demonstrated.

The demonstrations by inventors of many water conservancy and water lifting tools from Anhui and Hebei, such as He Ting and Wang Yuzhen, are extremely popular with the audience. There are often large crowds of people surrounding them to watch their demonstrations.

    农具展览会第二天
    耕作机具表演很受欢迎
    新华社6日讯　今天，全国农具展览会继续接待了中央和北京市各机关、团体、学校的观众和外宾。
    全国人民代表大会常务委员会副委员长沈钧儒，国务院副总理、国防部部长彭德怀，司法部部长史良也参观了展览会。
    看得最仔细的是各地在北京开会的代表。许多人从预展看起一直到现在还在看。安徽、河南、湖北、河北、黑龙江、湖南、江西等省送农具前来参加展览会的干部和农民，还展开了广泛的学习。河南登封县农民张广义对各地创造的提水工具、运输工具、加工工具都很注意，他一天就模画了两件新农具的图样。另一个陕西省的代表，已经画了十几幅图样了。
    今天，沈钧儒、彭德怀、史良等都看得很仔细，而且越看越兴奋。在农田灌溉排水机具馆里，他们对群众创造的东西都很重视，向讲解员或发明者自己问得很详细；在听了讲解之后和他们握手致谢。
    本报讯　在全国农具展览馆广场北面的田野里，我国新制的手扶拖拉机、卫星牌56型链轨式拖拉机和河南长葛县创造的双层深耕犁等耕作机具，给观众们作了表演。
    今后，展览会展出的各种拖拉机，农民发明创造的重要农具，和新近各地改造、创造的一些耕作机具，都要依次向观众作实际耕作表演。
    这次展览会的特点，不仅是把当前全国农具改革运动中工农群众改造和创造的新东西摆出来，而且要使观众真正看到这些新东西的实际效果，以便他们学习和交流经验。因此，这次展览会对操作非常重视。凡是能作表演的都要表演，而且尽可能让发明创造者自己表演。即使还不够完美的东西也要表演，以便吸收各方意见，作进一步的改进。
    除耕作机具另辟有面积广大的表演场外，绝大部分排灌工具和水利施工工具、固定动力机械都不是一般的陈列，而是随时都在那里表演。像沼气点灯、风力发电、饲料粉碎机磨粉等等都在表演。
    安徽、河北的许多水利提水工具的发明创造者如贺亭、王玉振等人的表演，是极受观众欢迎的。在他们表演的地方，经常有大批人围着参观。
