The campaign to eliminate crop diseases and insect pests has been widely launched. Thanks to thorough preparation and full effort, prevention and control work is being carried out extensively, quickly, well, and economically. At present, the wheat blossom midge control work in the winter wheat area has basically come to an end. In Henan and Shaanxi provinces alone, more than 23 million mu have been treated with pesticides, more than double the area treated for blossom midge nationwide last year. Wheat spider and wheat aphid are generally not given much attention in ordinary years, but this year nearly 8 million mu have been treated in some counties and cities of Shanxi, Jiangsu, and Shaanxi provinces alone. In Ci County, Hebei, more than 113,000 people were mobilized to treat more than 350,000 mu in one day, eliminating the wheat spider that was harming the entire county. Anhui and Jiangsu provinces have prepared more than 13,000 tons of sulfur to actively prevent wheat stem rust.

In order to do a good job in preventing insect pests this year, the work of eliminating overwintering pests last winter and this spring was better than in any previous year. According to statistics from ten provinces, including Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, a total of more than 165.5 million mu of overwintering rice borers were eliminated, an increase of 65% over last year. The work of eliminating overwintering corn borers has also become a mass movement in many places, and Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi and Shen County in Shandong have basically eliminated overwintering corn borers.

Many inspiring scenes have emerged in the prevention and control work. The determination of the leadership and the enthusiasm of the masses eloquently demonstrate that the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are fully capable of realizing the task of eliminating major crop diseases and insect pests proposed in the National Program for Agricultural Development ahead of schedule. The battle to eliminate wheat blossom midge in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan, is a vivid example. According to pest situation monitoring, the prefecture seized the favorable opportunity of the sunny weather after the rain on April 24, when a large number of blossom midges emerged from the soil, and put forward the fighting slogan of working hard day and night to completely eliminate the blossom midge. For a time, telephones and broadcasts throughout the prefecture sounded in unison, and members of the county party committees led a large number of cadres, concentrated all vehicles, and rushed to transport medicines and machinery. On the 25th, all general work in the prefecture, except for large and medium-sized water conservancy projects and rice seedling cultivation, was suspended, and all meetings in counties, districts, and townships that had not ended on the 24th were ended ahead of schedule, and they returned to their hometowns and communes overnight to participate in the insect eradication battle. From the night of the 24th to the morning of the 25th, a total of more than 2.3 million laborers and more than 22,700 cadres and teachers were mobilized throughout the area, and a total of more than 7.28 million mu were treated, achieving an unprecedented brilliant victory of rapid battle and quick resolution.

    除治小麦吸浆虫打了胜仗
    安徽江苏正在大力防治小麦秆锈病
    本报讯　歼灭农作物病虫害的战役已广泛展开，由于准备充分、干劲十足，防治工作进行得又多、又快、又好、又省。目前，冬麦地区的小麦吸浆虫防治工作已经基本结束。仅河南、陕西两省已用药剂防治二千三百余万亩，比去年全国防治吸浆虫面积扩大一倍以上。麦蜘蛛、麦蚜在一般年份是不大注意防治的，今年仅山西、江苏、陕西三省部分县、市即防治近八百万亩；河北磁县动员十一万三千余人，一天以内即防治三十五万余亩，消灭了为害全县的麦蜘蛛。安徽、江苏两省共准备硫磺一万三千余吨，积极防治小麦秆锈病。
    为了做好今年虫害的预防工作，去冬今春消灭过冬害虫工作比以往任何一年都做得好。据湖北、湖南、江西等十个省统计，共消灭过冬水稻螟虫一亿六千五百余万亩，比去年扩大65％。消灭过冬玉米螟工作也在许多地方形成群众性的运动，山西长治专区和山东莘县等地已基本上把过冬玉米螟虫消灭干净。
    在防治工作中出现了许多振奋人心的场面，领导的决心、群众的干劲，雄辩地说明了我国人民在共产党领导下完全可能提前实现农业发展纲要所提出的消灭农作物主要病虫害的任务。河南南阳专区歼灭小麦吸浆虫的战役就是一个生动的事例。该专区根据虫情测报，抓紧4月24日雨后天晴，吸浆虫大批羽化出土的有利时机，提出苦战一昼夜，全歼吸浆虫的战斗口号。一时全专区内电话、广播齐声响，各县县委委员率领大批干部，集中所有车辆，赶运药械。25日全专区除大、中型水利工程及水稻育秧工作外，一般工作全部暂停，各县、区、乡24日尚未结束的会议全部提前结束，连夜回乡、回社，参加灭虫战斗。24日夜至25日上午，全区共出动劳动力二百三十多万人，干部和教职员二万二千七百多人，共防治了七百二十八万多亩，取得史无前例的速战速决的辉煌战果。
