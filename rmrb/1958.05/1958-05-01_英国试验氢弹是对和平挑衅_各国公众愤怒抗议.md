Xinhua News Agency Dispatch: The British action of conducting a nuclear test near Christmas Island in the Pacific on April 28th has aroused angry condemnation from the public in various countries.

    The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Right" published a commentary on April 30th, condemning the recent British nuclear weapons test and considering it an action of direct provocative nature to peace.

    The All-Japan Federation of Student Self-Government Associations sent a telegram to British Prime Minister Macmillan on April 29th, protesting the British nuclear test and demanding an immediate cessation of further tests.

    Ikuo Yasui, Director of the Japan Council Against Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs, issued a statement on the 29th, criticizing the British nuclear weapons test. He stated that the Japanese people would strengthen the mass movement against nuclear weapons, protest the British nuclear test, and demand that it comprehensively cease such tests.

    The British government's continued nuclear testing has also aroused opposition from the British public. British Labour Party leader Gaitskell questioned the new hydrogen bomb test conducted by Britain in the Christmas Island area of the Pacific in the House of Commons on April 29th. Gaitskell said that if the British government continued to conduct hydrogen bomb tests, it would bear extremely serious responsibility for the possible consequences. Gaitskell reiterated his advocacy for a halt to nuclear weapons tests before holding a summit conference. The "Daily Herald" published an editorial on April 29th, saying: "We frankly ask the government not to act like the world's sinners anymore. The damage caused by ignorant politicians is enough."
