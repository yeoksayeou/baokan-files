    A Vivid Marxist Report
    Recently, the articles published in the People's Daily by some provincial, municipal, and county party secretaries are full of profound mass viewpoints, a spirit of practical work, the style and bearing of the proletariat, and are permeated with revolutionary dialectics. Each article can be called a vivid Marxist report. The authors, with rich materials, clear viewpoints, and logic, enthusiastically and vividly depict the thoughts, feelings, and actions of the broad masses of people, and paint a magnificent picture of socialist revolution and socialist construction in brilliant colors. This is a paean to socialism, a paean to the people, a paean to the Party, and a paean to the East Wind! These articles provide people with rich nourishment in politics, thought, and methodology, making people invigorated, full of energy, and filled with confidence to advance triumphantly toward a better tomorrow.
