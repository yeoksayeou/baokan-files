Dulles also said the following at the same press conference: that a "power vacuum" exists in Venezuela, and that this is a political factor in the rise of anti-American sentiment in that country. Then, he put on the face of a complete interventionist and said that "the basic sentiments of the Venezuelan nation and the Venezuelan people are improper."

The "vacuum theory" is nothing new. Eisenhower developed it into the notorious "Eisenhower Doctrine" to interfere in various Middle Eastern countries. Now, Dulles is applying it to Venezuela. Dulles's intention is very clear. It seems that the American ruling group is very fond of this "vacuum theory" - an excuse for armed interference in other countries.

To the American ruling group's dismay, the people of the Middle Eastern countries do not recognize them as a "vacuum," and the "Eisenhower Doctrine" has thus gone bankrupt; the Venezuelan people have just driven away U.S. Vice President Nixon, which proves that there is even less of a "vacuum" there. Although the U.S. troops at the Caribbean base have not withdrawn and are still posturing for intervention, the future of Dulles's "vacuum theory" will definitely not be wonderful.

    打错算盘
    杜勒斯在同一次记者招待会上还说了这样的话，委内瑞拉“存在一种力量真空状态”，是这个国家反美情绪高涨的一个政治因素。接着，他就摆出一副十足的干涉者面孔说，“委内瑞拉国家和委内瑞拉人民的基本情绪是不正当的”。
    “真空论”，毫不新鲜，艾森豪威尔曾把它发展成为臭名远扬的“艾森豪威尔主义”，用来干涉中东各国；现在，杜勒斯又把它运用到委内瑞拉头上了。杜勒斯打的什么主意是很清楚的。看来，美国统治集团很是爱上了这个“真空论”——一个武装干涉他国的借口。
    对于美国统治集团可悲的是中东各国人民不承认他们是“真空”，“艾森豪威尔主义”于是破产了；委内瑞拉人民也刚刚轰跑了美国副总统尼克松，足证那里更不是“真空”。虽然，加勒比基地的美国军队并未撤回去，仍然摆着干涉的架势，但是杜勒斯的“真空论”的前途决不会是美妙的。
