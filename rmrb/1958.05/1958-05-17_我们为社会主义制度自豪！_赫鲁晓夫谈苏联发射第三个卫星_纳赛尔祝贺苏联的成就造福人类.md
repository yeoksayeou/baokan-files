    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 15th. President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, speaking at the Soviet-Arab Republic People's Friendship Conference here on the 15th, congratulated the Soviet people on the successful launch of the third artificial satellite. He said that this achievement of the Soviet people would benefit all mankind.
    He also mentioned that he and his companions had benefited greatly from their visit to the Soviet Union. He said that the most important thing we saw here was the Soviet people, who are creating great undertakings, working to strengthen their country's economy, and contributing to the cause of consolidating peace.
    Khrushchev, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, spoke at the conference about the Soviet Union's launch of the third artificial satellite, saying that we will not lose our national pride in the socialist system, because this system has made it possible for us to surpass the United States in science and technology in this regard. He emphasized that the Soviet Union would under no circumstances use its achievements in this area to directly or indirectly harm mankind.
    Khrushchev said that the launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite proves that the Soviet Union's scientific and technological thought is developing rapidly, and proves that Soviet industry is capable of solving the most complex technical tasks.
    Khrushchev then asked, isn't it time to look at problems realistically, not to intimidate each other, but for countries with different systems to sit down at a table and talk about how to live together? Khrushchev reiterated that the Soviet Union sincerely hopes to hold a summit conference. He said that if agreements could be reached at the summit on issues that have matured, it would be the beginning of the end of the Cold War. Khrushchev expressed regret that the United Nations Security Council had not fulfilled its mission in stopping American aircraft carrying hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border.
    Khrushchev congratulated Nasser, saying that relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic are developing in a spirit of sincere friendship and cooperation. There is full mutual understanding between our two countries. He believes that Nasser's visit is a valuable contribution to the development of friendly relations between the two countries. Khrushchev also expressed admiration for the heroic struggle of the Arab people for freedom and independence.
    Nasser also pointed out in his speech that he and his companions felt the Soviet people's sympathy for the people of the United Arab Republic during their visit to the Soviet Union. He said that when we leave the Soviet Union, we will take back the best friendship that connects the people of our two countries.
    President Nasser spoke in detail about the Arab people's struggle against colonialism and the struggle for the freedom and independence of Arab countries and against the conspiracies of imperialist countries. He pointed out that we have received support from the Soviet Union and the Bandung peaceful forces in our struggle.

　　我们为社会主义制度自豪！
    赫鲁晓夫谈苏联发射第三个卫星
    纳赛尔祝贺苏联的成就造福人类
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔在15日这里举行的苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国人民友好大会上讲话时，祝贺苏联人民发射第三个人造卫星成功。他说，苏联人民的这个成就将造福整个人类。
    他还谈到，他和他的同伴在访问苏联时得到了很大的益处。他说，我们在这里看到的最主要的东西就是苏联的人民，他们创造伟大的事业，为加强自己国家的经济而劳动，他们为巩固和平事业而贡献出力量。
    苏共中央第一书记、苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在这次大会上的讲话中谈到苏联发射第三个人造卫星时说，我们不会失去我们对社会主义制度的民族自豪感，因为这个制度使我们有可能在这方面超过了美国的科学和技术。他强调指出，苏联在任何情况下都不会利用这方面的成就来直接或间接地危害人类。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联第三个人造卫星的发射证明，苏联的科学技术思想正在飞速发展，证明苏联工业有能力解决最复杂的技术任务。
    赫鲁晓夫接着问道，用现实的态度来看待问题、不是彼此恐吓，而是坐到一张桌子上来会谈不同制度的国家怎样共同生活，这样的时候难道还没有到吗？赫鲁晓夫再次强调指出，苏联真诚地希望举行高级会议。他说，在高级会议上如果能就已经成熟的问题达成协议，那将是结束冷战的开端。赫鲁晓夫对于联合国安全理事会在制止载有氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行的问题上没有履行自己的任务，表示遗憾。
    赫鲁晓夫向纳赛尔祝贺说，苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国的关系在本着真诚友好和合作的精神发展。我们两国之间有着充分的互相谅解。他认为纳赛尔这次的访问是对发展两国友好关系的一个宝贵的贡献。赫鲁晓夫还对阿拉伯人民争取自由和独立的英勇斗争表示钦佩。
    纳赛尔在他的讲话中还指出，他和他的同伴在访问苏联期间，感受到苏联人民对阿拉伯联合共和国人民的同情。他说，我们离开苏联时将把联结我们两国人民的最美好的友情带回去。
    纳赛尔总统详细谈到了阿拉伯人民反对殖民主义的斗争以及争取阿拉伯国家的自由和独立、反对帝国主义国家的阴谋的斗争。他指出，我们在斗争中受到苏联和万隆和平力量的支持。
