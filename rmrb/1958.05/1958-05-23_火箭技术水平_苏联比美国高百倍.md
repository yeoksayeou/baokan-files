Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 22nd:

The maximum thrust power of some rockets used by the Soviet Union to launch artificial satellites is dozens of times greater than that of the world's largest Kuibyshev Hydroelectric Power Station, while the maximum power of American rockets is much smaller than that of some large hydroelectric power stations. This was stated in an article recently published in the Soviet "Industrial Economics Gazette" by Soviet Doctor of Technical Sciences, Professor Rebkin.

This article focuses on comparing the level of rocket technology between the Soviet Union and the United States from a dynamic point of view. The article states that the maximum weight of American satellites is almost only 1% of the Soviet Union's third satellite. This means that the thrust power of the rockets used by the United States to launch satellites is also about that much smaller. In the future, spacecraft that can carry people and ensure their return to Earth should weigh at least several tons. Soviet engineers are already close to being able to launch such heavy objects into space, while the American rocket manufacturing industry apparently does not have such a level.

The article points out that it is quite difficult to transition from rockets with small weight and power to rockets with large weight and power. To achieve this, it is necessary to find new super-strong and super-light materials, more rational rocket structures, and more rational calculation methods in rocket spacecraft structural mechanics. Closely related to this is ensuring stable engine thrust, ensuring smooth changes in thrust, and reducing vibrations that affect the rocket structure during the intense start-up of rocket engines.

From this, it can be seen that expanding the size, weight, and power of rockets simply by expanding the structure of effective and relatively small rockets is impossible. In this regard, almost every 1% increase in rocket size requires strenuous efforts from material scientists, metallurgists, designers, and workers.

The fact that Soviet rockets are almost a hundred times heavier than American ones proves that the creative efforts of the Soviet people are truly approaching a technical miracle. The article emphasizes that the rockets used by the Soviet Union to launch artificial satellites are not only unprecedented "record creators" in the power machinery manufacturing industry, but also a huge leap in improving this record.

### 火箭技术水平  苏联比美国高百倍

    火箭技术水平
    苏联比美国高百倍
    新华社莫斯科22日电　苏联发射人造卫星用的一些火箭的最大推进功率，比目前世界上最大的古比雪夫水电站还要大几十倍，而美国火箭的最大功率却比一些大水电站小得多，这是苏联“工业经济报”最近发表的苏联技术科学博士雷勃金教授的一篇文章中说的。
    这篇文章着重从动力学观点把苏、美两国火箭技术水平作了比较。文章说，美国卫星的最大重量，几乎只是苏联第三个卫星的1％。这就是说，美国用来发射卫星的火箭的推进功率也大约小这么多。今后能够载人并且保证人能回到地球的宇宙飞行器械至少应当有几吨重。苏联工程师已经接近于能向宇宙空间发射这样重的物体，而美国火箭制造业显然没有这样的水平。
    文章指出，从重量和功率都小的火箭过渡到重量和功率都大的火箭，是相当困难的。要做到这一点，必须要找出新的超坚固和超轻的材料、更合理的火箭结构和火箭飞船结构力学方面更合理的计算方法。与此有紧密联系的，还要保证发动机推力稳定，保证推力平稳地改变，减低在火箭发动机激烈开动时对火箭结构有影响的振动。
    由此可见，扩大火箭的体积、重量和功率，单纯按照使用有效的比较小的火箭结构加以扩大，是不可能做到的。这方面几乎是，火箭大小每增加1％，都需要材料学家、冶金学家、设计师和工人做出紧张的努力。
    而苏联火箭的重量几乎比美国的大一百倍，这一点证明，苏联人民的创造性努力，真正是接近了技术奇迹了。文章着重指出，苏联用来发射人造卫星的火箭，不仅是动力机器制造业中空前的“纪录创造者”，而且是在提高这种纪录方面的巨大的飞跃。
