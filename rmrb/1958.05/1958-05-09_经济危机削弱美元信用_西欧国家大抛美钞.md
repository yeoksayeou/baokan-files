Xinhua News Agency, 8th dispatch from New York: According to the May 3rd issue of "Business Week," Western European national banks and private companies are selling off large quantities of US dollars and buying gold to protect their assets from the impact of the American economic crisis.

Western European banks now convert newly acquired US dollars entirely into gold, unlike in the past when they converted only a portion into gold and kept the rest in short-term US dollar deposits.

"Business Week" pointed out that, as a result, since January 1st of this year, the United States has seen more than $700 million worth of gold transferred into the hands of Western Europe. In addition, Western European private capital in the United States is being transferred back across the Atlantic, with a large portion returning to London. The magazine indicated that this is happening because: 1. Western European countries are doubtful about the prospects of American enterprises; 2. US interest rates are falling; 3. There is a growing suspicion that the economic crisis may eventually lead the United States to raise the price of gold (devalue the dollar).

"Business Week" said that the American economic crisis has weakened people's confidence in the dollar.

    经济危机削弱美元信用
    西欧国家大抛美钞
    新华社8日讯　纽约消息：据5月3日一期的“商业周刊”报道，西欧国家的国家银行和私人公司正在大量抛出美元，收购黄金，以免它们的资产受到美国经济危机的影响。
    西欧银行现在在手中有新获得的美元时就把它们完全换成黄金，而不像过去那样把部分换成黄金，部分作短期美元存款。
    “商业周刊”指出，由于这种情况，自从今年1月1日以来，美国已经有价值七亿多美元的黄金转入西欧手中，此外西欧在美国的私人资本正在从纽约转移回大西洋对岸，很大部分回到伦敦。这家周刊指出，所以发生这种情况是由于：一、西欧国家对美国企业前途的怀疑，二、美国的利率下降，三、人们越来越怀疑经济危机最后可能使美国提高黄金价格（美元贬值）。
    “商业周刊”说，美国的经济危机已经使人们对美元的信心削弱。
