    Cultivating Children's Love for Labor
    Shanghai Forms a "Greening Home Guard"
    (Our report) Shanghai, May 30th – Over 200,000 children in Shanghai have organized a "Greening Home Guard" with tree planting and protection as its main activities.
    The "Greening Home Guard" was initiated by the Young Pioneer team of Tangzijing Primary School at the Shanghai Municipal Young Pioneers Representative Assembly on March 10th, and subsequently established widely in many primary and secondary schools throughout the city. The "Greening Home Guard" organizations in each school are generally in the form of a combat team, with the school's Young Pioneer Brigade headquarters forming the Green Home Guard Headquarters, and the squadrons forming "combat regiments."
    The "Greening Home Guard" fighters learned tree care knowledge from the gardeners, watering, removing insects, loosening the soil, and fertilizing in a timely manner. Some "fighters" take turns keeping maintenance diaries, carefully observing the growth of the saplings. With the children's cultivation, the survival rate of these hundreds of thousands of saplings is very high. All the trees planted by the Green Home Guard fighters in the Tilanqiao Central Primary School, etc., have survived.
    In the past, many schoolchildren liked to break branches, pick flowers, or engrave their names on trees. Now, seeing the tender buds of the saplings they planted with their own hands turning green, they have become particularly protective of the trees. Many "Greening Home Guard" fighters immediately prop up trees with sticks and fence around the saplings they manage when they discover that the trees are about to be blown down by the wind during patrols. They put up propaganda wooden signs saying "Everyone is responsible for protecting trees" under the saplings on both sides of many sidewalks in the city. The "Greening Home Guard" also went deep into the neighborhoods to carry out tree protection propaganda to the neighborhood children and residents with the poems, fast-clapper talks, and living newspapers they compiled.

    培养孩子爱劳动的品德
    上海市组成一支“绿化近卫军”
    本报讯　上海市二十多万少年儿童组织成一支以植树护树为主要活动内容的“绿化近卫军”。
    “绿化近卫军”是在3月10日在上海全市少年先锋队代表大会上由塘子泾小学少先队倡议发起的，随后在全市许多中小学中都普遍成立。各学校的“绿化近卫军”组织一般都是一种战斗队的形式，以全校少年先锋队大队部组成绿化近卫军司令部，以中队为单位分别成立“战斗团”。
    “绿化近卫军”的战士们向园丁伯伯学习了护树的知识，他们适时浇水、除虫、松土、施肥。有些“战士”轮流记养护日记，细心的观察小树的生长情况。这数十万棵小树在孩子们的培养下，成活率都很高。提篮桥区中心小学等绿化近卫军战士种的树全都活了。
    过去，许多学校儿童喜欢折树、采花或者把自己的名字刻在树上，现在，孩子们看到自己亲手种植的小树嫩芽已绿满枝头，他们对树木变得格外爱护。很多“绿化近卫军”战士在巡逻时发现小树将要被风吹倒，立即用棍子把树撑起来，并在他们自己管理的小树周围圈上篱笆。他们在市区很多人行道两旁的小树下，插上“爱护树木人人有责”的宣传木牌。“绿化近卫军”还深入到里弄活动，把自己编的诗歌、快板、活报剧等向里弄儿童和居民们进行护树宣传。
