Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 3rd: The project to expand the diversion of the Yellow River to aid the Wei River, capable of irrigating over 15 million mu of farmland in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces, held a water release ceremony on the 1st.

The main canal and branch canals of this project have completed 50 structures, including sluice gates, bridges, culverts, and weirs. The headworks diversion gate is a six-hole reinforced concrete large gate with a diversion flow rate of 280 to 350 cubic meters per second.

The water diverted by this project will irrigate over 9 million mu of land in the Tianjin and Cangxian area of Hebei Province, including over 6 million mu of paddy fields; irrigate 1.5 million mu of land in the Dezhou and Wucheng area of Shandong Province; and irrigate nearly 5 million mu of land in Henan Province. Many farmlands in the irrigation area did not grow crops in the past. For example, the coastal saline-alkali land in the Cangxian area used to only grow reeds and weeds. After being developed into paddy fields, it is estimated that each mu can produce over 500 jin of rice. Therefore, the benefits of the project in the same year can exceed the national investment several times. In addition, two hydropower stations with a power generation of 20,000 kilowatts can be built by utilizing the weirs on the main canal. With the increase in water volume in the Wei River, the South Grand Canal, and the Hai River, the shipping industry will also be further developed.

The project to divert the Yellow River to aid the Wei River is the People's Victory Canal, which was completed and released water in 1952. (Attached picture)

    引黄济卫扩建工程放水
    可灌溉三个省的一千五百万亩农田
    据新华社郑州3日电　可以灌溉河南、河北、山东三省一千五百多万亩农田的引黄灌溉济卫扩建工程，1日举行放水典礼。
    这一工程的总干渠和干渠上共完成闸门、桥梁、涵洞、跌水等建筑物五十座。渠首引水闸是六孔的钢筋混凝土大闸，引水流量为二百八十到三百五十秒公方。
    这个工程引的水，将灌溉河北省天津和沧县一带九百多万亩土地，其中有六百多万亩水稻；灌溉山东省德州、武城一带一百五十万亩土地；灌溉河南省近五百万亩土地。灌区内的好多农田，过去不长庄稼，如沧县一带的海滨盐碱地过去只长芦苇和野草，开辟为水稻田后，预计每亩可产稻五百斤以上。因此，当年工程效益就可以超过国家投资数倍。另外，利用总干渠上的跌水，还可以兴建两座发电达二万瓩的水电站；卫河、南运河和海河的水量增加后，航运事业也将更加发展。
    引黄灌溉济卫渠就是人民胜利渠，是1952年建成放水的。（附图片）
