Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 22nd: The Vietnamese Labor Party's political theory journal "Study" recently published an article entitled "Strengthening Unity is a Matter of Life and Death for the Socialist Camp," stating that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's (LCY) erroneous views on some basic issues of proletarian internationalism and Marxism-Leninism demonstrate that the Yugoslav leaders have abandoned the proletarian stance and viewpoint and embarked on the path of revisionism.

The article pointed out that the errors of the LCY's draft program are not only theoretical errors, but also deny the international solidarity between socialist countries, thereby putting forward arguments that are harmful to the unity of the socialist camp.

The article refuted the LCY's draft program's strange argument about some socialist countries ruling, oppressing, and exploiting other socialist countries. The article said that because socialist countries are all governed by the working class and have achieved public ownership of the means of production, or public ownership of the means of production already occupies an important part of the national economy, it is impossible for one socialist country to oppress another. For example, Vietnam is an economically backward country, and the tremendous achievements of Vietnam's three-year economic recovery are inseparable from the assistance of fraternal countries, especially the Soviet Union and China. The most economically developed socialist countries are precisely the countries that have given the Vietnamese people the most assistance. Therefore, the above-mentioned argument of the LCY program is unfounded both in theory and in practice.

The article refuted the LCY's draft program's erroneous view of regarding the unity of the socialist camp as the implementation of a policy of strength and the division of blocs. The article said that the existence of the socialist camp is not at all the result of the so-called policy of dividing blocs, but precisely the inevitable and objective result of the victory of socialism on a quarter of the world's land, and the inevitable and objective result of the overall decline of imperialism on a global scale and the gradual demise of the imperialist system after the Soviet Union's victory in the anti-fascist war. Secondly, there is also a fundamental difference between the international policies of the two camps. Today, it is precisely the United States-led imperialism that advocates a policy of strength. The views of the LCY draft program on these issues violate the spirit of the Peace Manifesto signed by the LCY, and these views are very harmful.

The article refuted the LCY leaders' argument that takes the division of Vietnam as an example to illustrate that the Soviet Union, like the imperialist countries, is dividing and vying for "spheres of influence." The article said that Yugoslav leaders have misunderstood the situation in Vietnam. The Vietnamese people's war of resistance against imperialist aggression has achieved great victories. The Geneva Accords recognized Vietnam's independence and unity. The 17th parallel is only a temporary demarcation line for the two sides to assemble while waiting for negotiations to discuss national general elections. However, because the United States and its lackeys are undermining Vietnam's unity, Vietnam has not yet achieved unity to this day. Despite this, no one can deny that North Vietnam has been completely liberated and is building a socialist society, which is the result of the Vietnamese people's struggle victory. The Yugoslav leaders regard the issue of the liberation of North Vietnam as a result of the Soviet Union and American imperialism dividing "spheres of influence and influence," which is a denial of the achievements of the Vietnamese working class and people's decades of revolutionary struggle.

The article pointed out that the LCY draft program regards the political and ideological unity of socialist countries as "ideological monopoly," which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The article said that the unity between the communist parties and socialist countries is because they have the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles and have the common goal of building socialism and communism. The LCY's emphasis on its own "special path" and its denial of the universal laws of socialist revolution are completely wrong.

The article pointed out that the LCY draft program believes that the Soviet Union's leading role in the socialist camp is "political hegemony," but anyone can see the significance of the Soviet Union's leading role in the socialist camp, which is completely unrelated to the "political hegemony" viewpoint in the LCY draft program.

The article said that the arguments in the LCY draft program that violate the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism only benefit imperialism.

The article finally pointed out that opposing the revisionist views expressed on the issue of proletarian internationalism and some basic issues of Marxism-Leninism is one of the most important tasks of all communists today. This is a matter of principle.

    越南劳动党刊物“学习”杂志评南共纲领
    南共领导人曲解越南分裂原因是否认越南人民长期斗争成果
    新华社河内22日电　越南劳动党政治理论性刊物“学习”杂志最近以“加强团结一致是关系到社会主义阵营的生死存亡的问题”为题发表文章说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案在无产阶级国际主义和马克思列宁主义的一些基本问题上的错误观点说明，南斯拉夫领导人已经放弃了无产阶级的立场和观点，走上了修正主义的道路。
    文章指出，南共纲领草案的错误不仅是理论上的错误，而且是已经否认了社会主义国家之间的国际团结，从而提出了对社会主义阵营的团结有害的论调。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案提出的关于一些社会主义国家统治、压迫和剥削另一些社会主义国家的奇怪论调。文章说，由于社会主义国家都是由工人阶级掌握政权，并且已经实现了生产资料的公有制，或者是生产资料公有制已经占国民经济的重要部分。因此，不可能有这个社会主义国家压迫那个社会主义国家的现象。例如越南是经济落后的国家，而越南三年恢复经济工作所取得的巨大成就是同各兄弟国家、首先是苏联和中国的援助分不开的。经济最发达的社会主义国家正是给予越南人民最多的援助的国家。因此，南共纲领的上述论调，在理论和实际上都是没有根据的。
    文章驳斥了南共纲领草案把社会主义阵营的团结看成是实行实力政策和划分集团的政策的错误观点。文章说，社会主义阵营的存在完全不是所谓划分集团的政策的结果，而正是社会主义在世界四分之一的土地上获得胜利的必然和客观发展的结果，是帝国主义在世界范围内的总衰退和苏联反法西斯战争获得胜利之后，帝国主义体系逐渐衰亡的必然和客观发展的结果。其次，两个阵营的国际政策也有根本区别。今天主张实力政策的正是美国为首的帝国主义。南共纲领草案在这些问题上的观点违反了南共签字的和平宣言的精神，这些观点非常有害。
    文章驳斥了南共领导人以越南的分裂为例来说明苏联同帝国主义国家一样地瓜分、争夺“势力范围”的论调。文章说，南斯拉夫领导人错误地理解了越南的情况。越南人民抵抗帝国主义侵略的战争已经取得了伟大的胜利。日内瓦协议承认越南的独立和统一。十七度纬线只是在等待通过协商来讨论全国普选的时期内双方集结的暂时的分界线。但是因为美国和他的走狗破坏越南的统一，使越南直到今天还没有实现统一。尽管这样，任何人也不能否认，越南北方已经完全解放，并且正在建设社会主义社会，这是越南人民的斗争胜利的结果。南斯拉夫领导人把越南北方获得解放的问题看成是苏联和美帝国主义瓜分“势力范围和影响区域”的结果，这是否认了越南工人阶级和人民几十年来革命斗争的成果。
    文章指出，南共纲领草案把社会主义各国在政治和思想上的团结一致看作是“思想垄断”，这是完全不符合事实的。文章说，各国共产党和社会主义国家之间的团结一致是因为他们有马克思列宁主义的原则的基础，并且有着建设社会主义和共产主义的共同目的。南共强调自己的“特殊道路”，而否认社会主义革命的普遍规律的观点是完全错误的。
    文章指出，南共纲领草案认为，苏联在社会主义阵营中的领导作用是“政治霸权”，但是，任何人都可以看出苏联在社会主义阵营中的领导作用的意义，这是同南共纲领草案中的“政治霸权”的观点毫不相干的。
    文章说，南共纲领草案中违反马克思列宁主义基本原则的论调只有利于帝国主义。
    文章最后指出，反对在无产阶级国际主义问题和马克思列宁主义的一些基本问题上表现出来的修正主义观点，是一切共产主义者当前最重要的任务之一。这是一个原则性的斗争。
