    Improvement of Rhizobium Inoculant Application Methods Needed

    After Rhizobium bacteria enter the root system of legume crops and form root nodules, they can absorb nitrogen from the air as nitrogenous nutrients for their symbiotic life, thereby making plant stems and leaves lush, pods plump, increasing yields, and benefiting subsequent crops. Our country is already promoting the large-scale use of artificially manufactured Rhizobium inoculants. This is a low-cost, high-yield, simple, and effective measure for increasing production. In the past, the general method was to mix three to five mace of inoculant with a small amount of clean water and then coat the seeds. In recent years, due to the development of many corresponding production-increasing technical measures such as close planting (increasing sowing quantity), seed treatment with pesticides and fertilizers, and collective large-scale seed treatment, etc., the application methods of Rhizobium inoculants should also be improved. First, the dosage should be increased to one tael per mu. Before seed treatment, first mix the inoculant with a small amount of soil or manure (within half a jin) with water and then coat the seeds, just enough to adhere to the seeds. If some pesticides (such as 666, Ceresan, etc.) are not suitable for wetting the seeds, the inoculant can be mixed with more manure or soil, using less clean water, and mixed with the pesticide-treated seeds in a semi-dry state and sown into the soil together. The period for seed treatment and sowing should be shortened as much as possible. Cover the furrows and holes as soon as possible after sowing.

    The advantages of this improved method are that the Rhizobium bacteria are appropriately diluted in the soil or manure, making it less likely to dry out, and the damage from pesticides can be reduced, preventing a large number of deaths. As long as they can attach to the seeds, the Rhizobium bacteria will quickly invade the root system and play a role when they encounter suitable conditions and the seeds germinate. Hu Jisheng

    根瘤菌剂使用方法要改进
    根瘤菌钻进豆类作物的根系形成根瘤之后，便可以吸收空气中的氮气作为他们共同生活的氮素养料，从而使植物茎叶茂盛，豆荚饱满，增加产量，有益后茬。我国已经在大量推广人工制造的根瘤菌剂。这是个本小利大，简而易行，行之有效的增产措施。过去一般用法是三—五钱菌剂混合少量清水拌种。近年来由于发展了许多相应的增产技术措施如密植（加大播种量），农药、农肥拌种以及集体大量拌种等……，根瘤菌剂的使用方法也应当改进。首先是用量应加大为每亩一两。拌种前先把菌剂和少量土壤或土粪（半斤以内）搀水混匀然后拌种，使能沾着种子就行了。如果某些农药（如六六六、赛力散等）不宜和种子着湿，可把菌剂搀和更多的土粪或土壤，少用一些清水，在半干的状态下和拌药的种子混合一并播入土中。拌种和播种的时期最好尽量缩短。播入沟穴也应尽早盖土。
    这个改进方法的优点是根瘤菌混在土壤或土粪中得到适当稀释，不容易晒干，而农药对它的伤害也可减轻，不致大量死亡。只要能依附在种子附近，遇到适合条件，种子发芽，根瘤菌就会迅速的侵入根系发挥作用了。　胡济生
