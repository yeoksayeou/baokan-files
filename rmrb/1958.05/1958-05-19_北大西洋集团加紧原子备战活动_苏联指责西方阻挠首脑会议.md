　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: TASS reported that the Soviet Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the 16th regarding the recent North Atlantic Treaty Organization foreign ministers meeting, pointing out that the meeting attempted to take a step backward on the issue of holding East-West talks.

　　The statement said that since the Soviet Union proposed convening a high-level meeting, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has implemented the following measures: the United States and British governments concluded an agreement to establish American rocket bases and atomic bases on British territory; the United States government forcibly demanded the establishment of such bases on the territory of other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; the West German Federal Parliament decided to equip the West German army with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, and other member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization agreed to this decision; the Supreme Command of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization demanded that the number of armed forces of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe be doubled; "joint ventures" were organized to produce the latest types of weapons, and West Germany was absorbed into this production; after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed a decision to stop nuclear weapons testing, the United States and Britain conducted new experimental nuclear weapons explosions.

　　The statement pointed out that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries have not done anything concrete that can be compared with the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing and further reduction of armed forces that is conducive to peace.

　　The statement pointed out that the United States government is attempting to replace the immediate cessation of American bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs flying towards the Soviet Union with the issue of establishing inspection zones in the Arctic. Accepting the American proposal on Arctic inspection cannot advance the entire issue of easing international tensions and eliminating the danger of sudden attacks, nor can it eliminate the threat of atomic war.

　　The statement said that the Soviet Union advocates a thorough solution to the disarmament issue. It is willing to reach an agreement with other relevant countries on this issue today. However, if Western countries still attempt to impose conditions dictated by the narrow interests of certain countries' military blocs on others when discussing the disarmament issue, then there is no, nor can there be, a basis for reaching an agreement. Facts prove that Western countries still do not have a genuine desire to reach an agreement on thoroughly solving the disarmament issue.

    北大西洋集团加紧原子备战活动
　　苏联指责西方阻挠首脑会议
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部16日就最近举行的北大西洋公约组织外长会议发表声明指出，这次会议企图在举行东西方会谈的问题上后退一步。
    声明说，自从苏联提出召开高级会议的建议以后，北大西洋公约组织实施了如下的措施：美国政府和英国政府之间缔结了在英国领土上建立美国火箭基地和原子基地的协定，美国政府强求在北大西洋公约组织的其他成员国领土上也建立这样的基地；西德联邦议院决定用原子武器和火箭武器装备西德军队，北大西洋公约组织其他成员国同意了这个决定；北大西洋公约组织最高司令部要求把北大西洋公约组织在欧洲的武装部队人数增加一倍；组织了生产最新式武器的“联营组织”，并吸收西德参加这种生产；在苏联最高苏维埃通过苏联停止试验核武器的决定以后，美国和英国还进行了新的核武器试验性爆炸。
    声明指出，北大西洋公约组织国家没有做任何能同苏联单方面停止试验核武器和进一步裁减武装部队相比的有利于和平的具体事情。
    声明指出，美国政府企图用在北极建立视察区的问题来代替立刻停止带有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机向苏联方向飞行的问题。接受美国关于北极视察的建议一点也不能使整个缓和国际紧张局势和消除发生突然攻击危险的问题有所进展，也不能消除原子战争的威胁。
    声明中说，苏联主张彻底解决裁军问题。它愿意今天就能就这个问题同其他有关国家达成协议。但是，如果西方国家在讨论裁军问题时仍然企图把由某些国家的军事集团的狭隘利益所规定的条件强加到别人头上，那么就没有也不可能有达成协议的基础。事实证明，西方国家至今还没有要在彻底解决裁军问题方面达成协议的真正愿望。
