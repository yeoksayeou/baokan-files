Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 25th - Several hundred Dai "Zanhas" (folk singers) in the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture are singing in praise of the soaring enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups.

During the day, at the water reservoir construction sites, blasting areas, and land reclamation sites in Xishuangbanna, many Zanhas labor alongside the farmers. They gather information on advanced and backward exemplary figures and events in production. At night, around bonfires, accompanied by a flute, they sing various new songs praising advanced blasters, women actively learning agricultural techniques, and advanced figures in tool innovation. The Zanhas' impromptu creations of true stories and moving songs often ignite the hearts of the people. Those resting pick up their tools and start working.

In Xishuangbanna, Dai women have traditionally never plowed the fields, and the elders say that fields plowed by women do not grow grain. This spring, most of the Dai men went to the water conservancy construction sites, and there were not enough people to plow the fields. At this time, Wang Yingyang, a woman from Mengzhe in Banna, broke through superstitious ideas and the ridicule of backward masses, and was the first to learn to plow. The Zanhas turned her story into songs and sang them everywhere. Women in various Bannas were greatly encouraged upon hearing this, and a surge of women learning to plow quickly emerged.

A deputy township head in Damenglong Township, Jinghong Banna, used to point fingers and give orders all day long without doing any labor. He didn't listen to the help from the leadership or the criticism from the masses. After the Zanhas sang about him, he went to the fields the next day. He said: "I love to hear the Zanhas sing, but I'm also afraid of them singing about me."

This spring, Xishuangbanna held "Zanha Conferences" in various places, letting them study the policies of the Great Leap Forward in production and the Party's literary and artistic policies, and requiring them to sing about good people and good deeds and criticize bad people and bad deeds. Dozens of Zanhas in Jinghong Banna voluntarily formed eight groups, carrying luggage, flutes, sanxians, and hoes, and went to various construction sites to perform. An old Zanha in his sixties also participated in labor at the construction site. He said, "Without participating in labor, one cannot understand the hearts of the people."

### 不参加劳动就不懂人民的心  傣族民间歌手背着笛子、三弦和锄头下工地

    不参加劳动就不懂人民的心
    傣族民间歌手背着笛子、三弦和锄头下工地
    据新华社昆明25日电　西双版纳傣族自治州的几百名傣族赞哈（民间歌手），正在为各族人民的冲天干劲而歌唱。
    白天，在西双版纳的水库工地、爆破场和开荒的地方，许多赞哈和农民在一起劳动。他们在生产中搜集先进的和落后的典型人物和事迹；晚上，点起篝火，在一根笛子的伴奏下，他们就演唱起歌唱先进的爆炸手、歌唱积极学习农业技术的妇女和改良工具的先进人物的各种新歌来。赞哈们即兴创作的真实的故事和动人的歌声，往往把人们的心都唱热了。正在休息着的人们，扛上工具就干起活来。
    西双版纳的傣族妇女从来不犁田，老人们说女人犁过的田不长谷子。今年春天，傣族男人们大部分到水利工地上去了，犁田的人手不够。这时候版纳孟遮一个叫王应养的妇女，冲破了迷信思想和落后群众的嘲笑，第一个学会了犁田，赞哈们把她的事迹编成故事到处演唱，各个版纳的妇女听了大受鼓舞，很快掀起了妇女学犁田的热潮。
    版纳景洪的大孟笼乡有个副乡长，天天指手划脚不劳动，领导的帮助和群众的批评他都不听。赞哈把他的事一唱，第二天就下了田。他说：我爱听赞哈唱、又怕赞哈唱。
    今年春天，西双版纳各地曾分别召开了“赞哈会议”，让他们学习生产大跃进的政策和党的文艺方针，要求他们歌唱好人好事和批判坏人坏事。版纳景洪的几十个赞哈自动组成八个小组，背着行李，带上笛子、三弦和锄头，分赴各个工地演唱。一个六十多岁的老赞哈，也到工地参加了劳动，他说：“不参加劳动就不知道人民的心。”
