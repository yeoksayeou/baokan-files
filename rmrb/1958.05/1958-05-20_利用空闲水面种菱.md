　　Planting Water Chestnuts on Idle Water Surfaces
　　In recent years, farmers in plain areas have cultivated and planted all the land that can be cultivated. However, production on water surfaces still has many places lying idle. In our Nantong area, apart from some agricultural cooperatives that have utilized all the water surfaces they own for fish farming and water chestnut planting, there are still many usable water surfaces lying idle everywhere. Therefore, I suggest that agricultural cooperatives in various regions utilize idle water surfaces for planting water chestnuts as much as possible. According to the specific conditions on both sides of the Yangtze River, planting water chestnuts is a sure and safe path to production.
　　One mu of water surface can grow seven thousand large water chestnut plants. Assuming ten large water chestnut plants yield one jin of water chestnuts, one can harvest seven hundred jin of water chestnuts. At eight fen per jin, this can be sold for more than fifty yuan. And one mu of land only requires four jin of water chestnut seedlings (for planting), costing only four or five jiao. Planting for six months can yield more than a hundredfold return. From spring to autumn, in August and September, as long as the river does not dry up, planting can be done. I hope everyone will pay attention to this production path and try planting it.

### 利用空闲水面种菱

　　利用空闲水面种菱
    这几年来，在平原地区的农民兄弟们，把陆地上可以种植的地面，都垦耘种植了。可是在水面上的生产，还有好多地方空在那里。我们南通地区，除了部分农业社利用了社里所有的水面养鱼、种菱之外，到处还有可以利用的水面空着。所以建议各地农业社，尽可能利用空闲的水面来种菱。根据长江两岸的具体条件，种菱是个稳打稳准的生产门径。
    一亩水面可以生长七千个大菱盘子，以十个大菱盘子摘一斤菱角计算，能收获七百斤菱角，每斤八分钱，就能卖五十元以上。而一亩面积上只需要四斤菱秧（种菱），成本不过四、五角钱。栽六个月，就可得到百倍以上的收获。从春天到秋天八九月里，只要河水不干涸，都可以种植。希望大家重视这项生产门径，试行种植起来。
