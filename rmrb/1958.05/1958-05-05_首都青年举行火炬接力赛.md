    Capital Youth Hold Torch Relay Race
    (Our report) This evening in the capital, a “May Fourth” Youth Sports Great Leap Forward torch relay race was held, with the participation of 1,728 workers, soldiers, students, and cadres. This competition was organized by the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League to commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement and to encourage young people throughout the city to actively participate in physical exercise.
    At 8:10 PM, more than 100 athletes from sixty-four relay teams, carrying torches and red flags, set off from Tiananmen Square, advancing along the streetcar loop line. The racing procession was like a fiery dragon speeding forward. Well-trained athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education took the lead from the start, with athletes from Tsinghua University and the Aviation Institute and other units closely following behind. After passing the second relay station (there were eight relay stations in total), the distance between the front and rear of the line had already reached three or four hundred meters. The streets along the route were lined with spectators, who constantly applauded and cheered for the athletes. The torch team's procession brought an exceptionally joyful scene to Beijing's festive night.
    The athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education consistently led the way. They were not overtaken by any opponent throughout the entire 24-li course. They completed the course in forty-two minutes and forty-eight point eight seconds, arriving back at Tiananmen Square first. Next to reach the finish line were athletes from Tsinghua University, the Mining Institute, the Aviation Institute, and the Geology Institute. Floodlights illuminated the area in front of Tiananmen Square as if it were daytime, and thousands of spectators applauded and cheered for these victors.
    After the relay race, a meeting was held in Tiananmen Square, including all the athletes who participated in the torch relay. As stipulated, the athletes from the Beijing Institute of Physical Education, who won first place, lit the large torch on the square. Zhang Youyu, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC and Vice Mayor of Beijing, and Rong Gaotang, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, both spoke at the meeting. They called on young people to actively participate in sports activities, improve their health, and work ten more years for socialism.
    The "May Fourth" Youth Sports Great Leap Forward Torch Relay Race was held for the first time this year and will be held every "May Fourth" from now on.

    首都青年举行火炬接力赛
    本报讯　昨晚在首都举行了有一千七百二十八名工人、战士、学生、干部参加的“‘五四’青年体育大跃进火炬接力比赛”。这次比赛是共青团北京市委为了纪念“五四”和鼓励全市青年积极参加体育锻炼而举办的。
    晚八时十分，六十四个接力队的一百多名运动员擎着火炬和红旗自天安门出发，沿着电车的环行线前进。竞赛的行列像一条火龙似地向前急驰。锻炼有素的北京体育学院运动员一开始就跑在最前面，清华大学和航空学院等单位的运动员紧跟在后面。跑过第二个接力站（共设八个接力站），头尾已相差三、四百公尺。沿途马路两边站满了观众，他们不时地为运动员们鼓掌加油。火炬队的行列，为北京的节日夜晚带来了异常欢乐的景象。
    北京体育学院的运动员们，一直领着先。他们在二十四华里的全程中，没有被任何一个对手超过。他们用了四十二分四秒八的时间第一个跑回到天安门。接着到达终点的是清华大学、矿业学院、航空学院、地质学院的运动员们。水银灯把天安门前照耀得如同白昼，成千的观众，向这些优胜者们鼓掌欢呼。
    接力赛结束后，在天安门前广场上，召开了包括所有参加这次火炬接力赛的运动员的大会。按照规定获得第一名的北京体育学院运动员点燃了广场上的大火炬。中共北京市委书记、北京市副市长张友渔和国家体委副主任荣高棠都在会上讲了话。他们号召青年积极参加体育活动，练好身体，为社会主义多工作十年。
    “‘五四’青年体育大跃进火炬接力赛”今年是第一次举行，以后每年“五四”都要举行一次。
