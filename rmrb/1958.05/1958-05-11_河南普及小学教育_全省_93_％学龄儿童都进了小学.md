Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 9th May: Henan Province has popularized primary education in one hundred and twenty-one of its one hundred and twenty-two counties and cities. From the beginning of March to the present, 37,438 new primary schools have been established, enrolling 2.3 million children. Including those already attending school, the total number of primary school students in the province has reached 7.23 million, with 93% of school-age children now in primary school.

The rapid development of this primary education popularization movement in Henan Province is mainly due to the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party entrusting this undertaking to the masses and implementing the socialist principle of running schools diligently and thriftily, combining education with production. Especially in the vast mountainous areas, by fully relying on the masses, creating forms of scattered single-teacher schools or mobile primary schools, and adopting methods of assigning sections of land to commune members, and teachers and parents sharing the responsibility of escorting students to and from school, the safety of students crossing mountains to attend school has been ensured, thus popularizing primary education ahead of schedule. The masses in Nanyang Prefecture reflected, "Chairman Mao's leadership is truly good, schools are being established deep in the mountains, things we never imagined are being done."

Everywhere, the masses have been following the spirit of spending less money to run more schools, and even running schools without spending money, adopting the methods of "finding spare houses, bringing their own desks and benches, borrowing textbooks, running schools at the doorstep, and hiring a teacher to start classes," and have established a large number of schools. Countless examples of the masses voluntarily vacating houses and donating labor and materials have occurred, so many new primary schools have been established without the state spending a single penny, and agricultural cooperatives and the masses have not had any financial burden. Many schools started classes with only a small amount of money spent on chalk.

The curriculum of the locally-run primary schools generally has few subjects. Most senior primary classes have agricultural common sense courses, and some have also added abacus and accounting common sense courses. The masses praised, "Locally-run primary schools are truly good, learning culture and weeding, the cooperative's cattle can be fed well, and agricultural production cannot run away".

### 河南普及小学教育  全省93％学龄儿童都进了小学

　　河南普及小学教育
    全省93％学龄儿童都进了小学
    据新华社郑州9日电　河南省在一百二十二个县、市中，已有一百二十一个县、市普及了小学教育。从3月初到目前止，各地新办小学三万七千四百三十八所，入学儿童二百三十万人。加上原已上学的，全省小学生已达七百二十三万人，学龄儿童93％都进了小学。
    河南省这次普及小学教育运动如此神速发展，主要原因之一是中共河南省委把这项全民的事业交给了群众自办，并且贯彻了勤俭办学、教育和生产相结合的社会主义的办学方针。特别是在广大山区，由于充分依靠群众，创造了分散设置一揽子学校或巡回小学的形式，和社员分地段负责、教师家长分工接送学生的办法，保证了学生翻山越岭上学的安全，提前普及了小学教育。南阳专区群众反映说：“毛主席领导真正好，白云深处办学校，想不到的事情也办到。”
    各地群众都是本着少花钱多办学、不花钱也办学的精神，采取了“找闲房子，自带桌凳，借用课本，门口办学，请个教师，就能上课”的办法，兴办起大量学校。群众自动腾房子、献工献料的事例不可胜数，因此新办了这么多小学，国家没有花一文钱，农业社和群众也没有什么经济负担，不少学校只用了很少的钱买粉笔就开课了。
    各地民办小学的课程一般门类不多，高小班大多设有农业常识课，有的还增设珠算和会计常识课。群众赞扬说：“民办小学真正好，又学文化又拔草，社里黄牛能喂好，农业增产跑不了”。
