Xinhua News Agency, May 29th, Paris Dispatch: While French democratic and republican forces are launching large-scale demonstrations against de Gaulle's establishment of a fascist regime, French right-wing forces and influential figures supporting de Gaulle are intensifying the final steps of their original plan, attempting to make de Gaulle's rule "legitimate" before the national anti-fascist struggle expands further.

    The French National Assembly and Senate today read out President Coty's letter. In the letter, Coty openly stated that he would summon de Gaulle to discuss the formation of a cabinet. Coty also threatened that if de Gaulle's attempt to form a cabinet failed, he "would have to immediately draw the necessary conclusions." It is speculated that in this case, Coty would resign from the presidency and transfer power to the Speaker of the National Assembly.

    After Coty's letter was read out, communist deputies and many socialist and radical socialist deputies sang the "Marseillaise" in protest, and communist deputies shouted "No fascism!" The Communist Party parliamentary group also issued a statement strongly condemning the attempt to bring de Gaulle to power.

    It is revealed that in the talks between Coty and the leaders of the Socialist Party, the Popular Republican Movement, and the Independent Party on the 28th, Coty threatened that he now had only two choices: either de Gaulle or a "Popular Front" including the Communist Party. If they could not quickly reach an agreement to allow de Gaulle to form a government, he would resign from the presidency himself and appeal to the "nation."

    As the anti-fascist struggle of the broad masses of people rises and the internal divisions of the bourgeois "middle" parties deepen, the plan for de Gaulle's "legal" ascension to power is not progressing smoothly.

    After meeting with the leaders of the three major parties, Coty decided to have the Speaker of the National Assembly, Le Troquer, and the President of the Senate, Monnerville, meet with de Gaulle. Sources say that this indicates he was not so successful in persuading some parties to quickly accept de Gaulle. It is said that Le Troquer and Monnerville did not reach an agreement on the conditions for de Gaulle's ascension to power after meeting with de Gaulle on the evening of the 28th: de Gaulle demanded "full powers," while Le Troquer believed that granting such great power would cause "fierce opposition" from many deputies.

    De Gaulle had already left Paris on the evening of the 28th and returned to his residence in Colombey-les-Deux-Églises. It is said that he will wait there for his "conditions to be met."

    It is reported that the Popular Republican, the current Prime Minister Pflimlin, after resigning, called on Popular Republican members on the 28th to support de Gaulle, demanding that the party's deputies "unite" around de Gaulle. However, after this news spread, the Popular Republican parliamentary group issued a communique denying that this had happened. It is pointed out that this situation reflects the party's current divisions on whether to support de Gaulle.

    The movements of the Socialist Party are noteworthy. Because this party holds nearly a hundred seats in parliament, its attitude has a great influence on whether de Gaulle can obtain "legal" approval in parliament. "Le Monde" in Paris, in discussing the attitude of the right-wing leader of the Socialist Party, Mollet, said, "Between de Gaulle and the communists, Mollet has chosen de Gaulle." However, many socialist deputies, under pressure from the strong opposition of grassroots members, do not approve of Mollet's position.

    法国右翼势力加紧活动
    企图使戴高乐立即上台
    据新华社29日讯　巴黎消息：在法国民主共和力量展开规模宏大的反对戴高乐建立法西斯政权的示威运动的同时，法国右翼势力和支持戴高乐的有势力人士正在加紧执行原先计划的最后步骤，企图在全国反法西斯斗争进一步扩大之前，立即使戴高乐“合法”执政。
    法国国民议会和参议院今天宣读了总统戈蒂的信件。戈蒂在信中公然表示，他将召见戴高乐商谈组阁问题。戈蒂还威胁说，如果要戴高乐组阁的尝试失败，他“将不得不立即作出必要的结论”。据推测，在这种情况下，戈蒂将辞去总统职务，将权利移交给国民议会议长。
    戈蒂信件宣读完毕后，共产党议员以及许多社会党和激进社会党议员高唱“马赛曲”表示抗议，共产党议员们还高呼“不许法西斯主义得逞”。共产党议会党团并发表声明坚决谴责使戴高乐当政的企图。
    据透露，戈蒂在28日同社会党、人民共和党和独立党三党领袖的会谈中威胁说，他现在只有两种选择，不是戴高乐，就是包括共产党在内的“人民阵线”。如果他们不能迅速达成协议，同意戴高乐组织政府，他本人就要辞去总统职务，并且将向“全国”申诉。
    随着广大人民反法西斯斗争的高涨和资产阶级“中间”党派内部分歧的加深，戴高乐“合法”上台的计划进行得并不顺利。
    戈蒂在同三大政党领袖会晤之后决定要国民议会议长勒特罗盖和参议院议长蒙纳维去见戴高乐。有消息说，这表示他在促使某些政党迅速接受戴高乐一点上并不那么成功。勒特罗盖和蒙纳维在28日晚间同戴高乐会面之后据说没有获致让戴高乐上台的条件的协议：戴高乐要求授予“全权”，而勒特罗盖认为如果授予这样大的权力就会引起许多议员的“剧烈反对”。
    戴高乐已经在28日晚间离开巴黎，回到他的科龙贝双教堂的住所。据说，他要在那里等候“满足他的条件”。
    据报道，人民共和党人，现任总理弗林姆兰在辞职以后曾经在28日号召人民共和党党员支持戴高乐，要求这个党的议员们“团结”在戴高乐的周围。但是，在这个消息传出以后，人民共和党的议会党团发表公报表示否认有这件事。据指出，这种情况反映出这个党目前在是否支持戴高乐的问题上还存在着分歧。
    引人注目的是社会党的动向。由于这个党在议会中握有差不多一百个席位，它的态度对戴高乐能否在议会中得到“合法”的批准有很大影响。巴黎“世界报”在谈到社会党右翼领袖摩勒的态度时说，“在戴高乐和共产党人之间，摩勒已经选定了戴高乐。”但是，社会党许多议员迫于下层党员的强烈反对情绪，并不赞成摩勒的立场。
