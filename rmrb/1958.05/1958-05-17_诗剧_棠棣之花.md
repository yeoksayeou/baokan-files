    Poetic Drama "Blossoms of the Pear Tree"
    The Central Academy of Drama's Experimental Theater Troupe is about to perform Guo Moruo's famous play "Blossoms of the Pear Tree".
    The creation of "Blossoms of the Pear Tree" took a considerable amount of time. In 1920, Guo Moruo wrote "Nie Ying". Over the next twenty years, the poet continuously enriched this play, and the finalized version "Blossoms of the Pear Tree" was completed in 1941. The play caused a sensation in Chongqing after its first performance there.
    This performance by the Experimental Theater Troupe is the play's first performance since liberation. Directors Geng Zhen and Shi Yifu have put in a lot of effort to seek novel artistic approaches to express the spirit of this poetic drama. (Wen Jin)

    诗剧“棠棣之花”
    中央戏剧学院实验话剧院即将演出郭沫若的名剧“棠棣之花”。
    “棠棣之花”的创作经过相当长的时间。1920年，郭沫若写了“聂嫈”，二十年间，诗人不断地充实丰富这个戏，到1941年才完成定稿“棠棣之花”。这个戏首次在重庆演出后，轰动了山城。
    这次实验话剧院的演出是这个戏解放后的首次演出。导演耿震、石一夫曾花过不少功夫努力寻求新颖的艺术处理来表现这个诗剧的精神。　（闻津）
