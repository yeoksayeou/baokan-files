　　Poetry Everywhere, Everyone Singing
　　Tong Jie, Head of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Hong'an County Committee, Hubei

　　Walk into Hong'an County, and you are surrounded by songs. From grandfathers to grandsons, from grandmothers to young women, from the county's first secretary to all the cadres, everyone is singing. Duets, solos, choruses, you name it. Mountain songs, clappercracks, jingles, cross-talks, drum songs, lotus falls… Singing and chanting, it's truly lively.

　　Everyone is singing about the socialist vision and human happiness, singing about the leap forward in production and the technological revolution, singing about praising the advanced and criticizing the backward… It's truly uplifting and full of fighting spirit.

　　Countless poems are written on walls, field ridges, pond banks, manure piles, stones, hillsides… In these bright spring days, the land of Hong'an County is truly colorful and dazzling.

　　The glorious Hong'an County is already a singing county: Poetry everywhere, everyone singing.

　　This torrent of poetry emerged with the great leap forward in production. This spring, the momentum of the Great Leap Forward swept through Hong'an. Men and women, young and old, all participated in the struggle against nature. Everyone fought day and night in the high mountains, low-lying areas, marshes, and plains, creating a massive momentum that excited everyone. Everyone wanted to sing.

　　As early as last winter, our county committee decided that all rural cadres must learn to use one form of artistic propaganda. Comrade Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county committee, took the lead in learning "Lotus Fall"; Deputy County Head Xiao Linshan learned the clappercrack; Cai Zhengzhong, director of the County Committee Office, learned cross-talk; and I learned the Hubei drum song. When we work or inspect production with the masses, we compose and sing about new scenes and new problems at any time, which boosted everyone's morale and guided the work. When Comrade Cheng Peng, the first secretary of the county committee, was inspecting production in the Xinjian Township, he saw a dozen women from "Shang Xujia" busy accumulating fertilizer, and immediately composed and sang:

　　Don't quarrel, don't make noise,
　　Listen to me sing a lotus fall,
　　Xinjian Township, Chunguang Cooperative,
　　Production is doing great,
　　No matter man or woman, old or young,
　　Production is superb.
　　The fertilizer accumulation team women are really good,
　　A big pile of fertilizer in half a day,
　　All the women in the village have come,
　　Double thousand catties will surely be achieved...

　　After the singing, these dozen women worked even more actively, and nineteen women who had never participated in production also joined in. Once, a section I composed and sang in Yuejin Cooperative, Zengjia Township, also played a role. I sang like this:

　　Yuejin Cooperative women are really capable,
　　In production, they are better than men;
　　I won't talk about other women for now;
　　I'll just talk about Ye Shaoqing.
　　Everyone knows this person,
　　Her energy is better than Mu Guiying;
　　She earned nine hundred work points in three months,
　　She never stops even in wind and rain.
　　A good example of diligence and thrift in managing the household,
　　Saving money and using it sparingly;
　　Her good deeds are endless,
　　Let me talk about a lazy woman;
　　It's better not to mention this person,
　　Mentioning her makes everyone angry,
　　She sleeps with her eyes open during the day,
　　And gets up in the middle of the night to eat fried rice;
　　When asked to produce, she refuses,
　　Saying, "Even the emperor's father can't make me do it."
　　I advise you, lazy woman,
　　Quickly change your bad habits;
　　If you don't correct yourself next time,
　　The storyteller will name you.

　　After listening to this drum book, the women in this cooperative all went to the fields to produce.

　　The wisdom of the masses is boundless. Since the Great Leap Forward, the masses have created more than 10,000 poems. These poems are full of emotion and have become a great force for motivating work and inspiring the people. Let me just recite a few of the masses' creations, which they spontaneously sang out of their feelings. Chen Zhengguo, Wang Yeshan, and Zhou Mingyou, members of the Huaguo Cooperative, co-composed and sang a song while resting in the field:

　　Winning red flags are flying all over the sky,
　　Production is in full swing everywhere;
　　Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law go down to the fields together,
　　The newlywed sister-in-law carries manure.
　　Eighty-year-old men don't leave the battle,
　　Children accumulate fertilizer and keep hygiene;
　　Everyone is for the Great Leap Forward,
　　Everyone wants to be a hero.

　　After the wave of learning technology spread throughout our county, men and women, young and old, all participated in the struggle to learn agricultural technology. There were stories of couples running experimental fields together and old couples debating technological revolutions for three days and three nights. When people who did not study technology well were encountered, poetry was also used for criticism. For example, nine young people in the Xuguang Cooperative, Xinghua Township, refused to attend the technical night school. Every night, they played cards, played chess, visited each other, and joked. Qin Maosheng, the production team leader, gave them the following advice at the mass meeting:

　　The river flows eastward,
　　Time flies and never returns,
　　If young people don't learn technology,
　　They will be old in the blink of an eye.

　　His loud and powerful singing infected the people present. Not only did these nine young people go to the technical night school, but even Qin Jisheng, a 73-year-old man, also went to the technical night school.

　　With the arrival of the production upsurge, a high tide of cultural learning quickly swept the county. Encouraged by the slogan of becoming a cultural county in one year, regardless of men, women, old or young, rain or shine, the people's schools were always packed. While producing, while learning, you teach me, I teach you, it is true that literacy textbooks are put in pockets, everywhere is a classroom, mutual teaching and mutual learning, everyone is a teacher and a student. How can such an unusual cultural life not produce many excellent poems?

　　This is how we do it: the secretary takes the lead, the whole party mobilizes, self-composes and sings, everyone opens their mouths. A upsurge of creating and reciting poetry has been formed. This has promoted the great development of production and the great leap forward in the cultural and artistic work of the rural masses. Now our Hong'an is truly: every household is full of joy, and everyone sings the praises of the new socialist countryside.

### 无处不见诗，无人不歌唱

    无处不见诗，无人不歌唱
    中共湖北红安县委宣传部长　童杰
    走进红安县，遍地是歌声。从祖父到孙子、从祖母到少妇少女，从县委第一书记到所有干部，大家都在唱。对唱、独唱、合唱样样有。山歌、快板、顺口溜，相声、大鼓、莲花落……说说唱唱，真是热闹。
    大家唱的是社会主义远景和人间幸福，唱的是生产跃进和技术革命，唱的是表扬先进批评落后……真是心情舒畅，斗志昂扬。
    数不尽的诗篇，写在墙上、田岸上、塘埂上、肥堆上、石头上、山坡上……在这春光明媚的日子里，红安县的大地真是五光十色，琳琅满目。
    光荣的红安县已经是：无处不见诗，无人不歌唱的歌唱县了。
    这诗的洪流，是随着生产大跃进出现的。今年春天，大跃进的声势，席卷了红安，男女老少都参加了向大自然斗争的行列，大家不分白天黑夜，战斗在高山、洼地、沼泽、平原，声势浩大，激动了所有的人们。大家都要唱。
    我们县委会早在去年冬天就作出决定：所有农村干部必须学会运用一种文艺宣传形式。县委第一书记程鹏同志带头学会“莲花落”；副县长萧林山学会了快板；县委办公室主任蔡正中学会了相声；我学会了湖北大鼓。我们和群众一道生产或检查生产时看到新景象新问题随时编、随时唱，鼓舞了大家的情绪，又指导了工作。县委第一书记程鹏同志在新建乡检查生产时，看到“上徐家”十来个妇女忙着积肥，马上编词说唱：
    不要吵，不要闹，
    听我说个莲花落，
    新建乡，春光社，
    生产搞得挺热闹，
    无论男和女，不管老和少，
    生产都是呱呱叫。
    积肥队妇女真不错，
    半天积肥一大垛，
    全村妇女都来了，
    双千斤一定有着落。……
    说唱后，这十来个妇女干的更积极，一贯不参加生产的十九个妇女也参加生产了。有一次我在曾家乡跃进社编唱的一段也很起作用。我是这样唱的：
    跃进社妇女真正行，
    生起产来赛男人；
    别的妇女暂不讲；
    单讲一讲叶少清。
    提起这人大家都知道，
    劲头赛过穆桂英；
    三个月做了工分九百整，
    刮风下雨也不停。
    勤俭持家好典范，
    省吃俭用度光阴；
    她的好事迹言不尽，
    再说一个懒女人；
    不提这人还罢了，
    提起来全塆老少怒气生，
    白天在床上睁眼睡，
    到半夜起来炒饭大口吞；
    叫她生产她不去，
    还说是：“皇帝的老子叫我也不行。”
    奉劝一声懒女人，
    快点改掉坏毛病；
    下次如果不改正，
    说书人就要点你的名。
    这个社的妇女，听了这段鼓书后都下地生产了。
    广大群众的智慧丰富无边。大跃进以来，群众创作的诗歌有一万多首。这些诗歌感情洋溢，成了鼓动工作、激发人民的伟大力量。我随便背几首群众的创作，这都是他们见景生情脱口而出的唱词。花果社社员陈正国、王叶山、周明友在田头休息时，合编合唱一首歌：
    优胜红旗满天飘，
    到处生产是高潮；
    婆媳双双把畈下，
    新婚大姐把粪挑。
    八旬老人不下阵，
    儿童积肥搞卫生；
    人人都为大跃进，
    个个都要逞英雄。
    我们县学习技术的浪潮传开了以后，不分男女老幼都参加了学习农业技术的斗争行列。出现了夫妻同办试验田，老俩口辩论技术革命三天三夜的佳话。遇到不好好学习技术的人，也运用诗歌进行批评。像杏花乡煦光社有九个青年拒绝上技术夜校，每天晚上三三两两玩朴克、下象棋、串门子、说笑话。生产队长秦茂生就在群众大会上向他们这样提意见：
    江水滚滚向东流，
    光阴一去不回头，
    青年不把技术学，
    转眼不觉到白头。
    他的宏亮有力的歌声，感染了到会的人们。不仅这九个青年上了技术夜校，连七十三岁的老人秦基生也上了技术夜校。
    随着生产高潮的到来，全县迅速掀起了文化学习高潮。在一年实现文化县口号的鼓舞下，不分男、女、老、少，无论刮风下雨，民校里总是座无虚席。边生产、边学习，你教我、我教你，真个是识字课本口袋装，到处是课堂、互教又互学、师生大家当。不寻常的文化生活，怎不产生许多优秀的诗篇呢？
    我们就是这样：书记带头，全党动手，自编自唱，人人开口。形成了创作诗歌、朗诵诗歌的热潮。促进了生产大发展，促进了农村群众文化艺术工作的大跃进。现在我们的红安真是：家家户户喜盈盈，人人歌颂社会主义新农村。
