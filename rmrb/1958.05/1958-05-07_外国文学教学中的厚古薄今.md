Reader's words:

    Overemphasis on the Ancient and Underestimation of the Modern in Foreign Literature Teaching
    The "Foreign Literature Teaching Syllabus" currently used by the Chinese departments of Normal Colleges has a serious tendency to overemphasize the ancient and underestimate the modern.
    The foreign literature teaching content stipulated in this syllabus is divided into four parts: (1) Foreign Literature from ancient times to the 18th century; (2) 19th-century foreign literature (excluding Russian literature); (3) 19th-century Russian literature; (4) Soviet literature. Many famous modern and contemporary writers from Western Europe, the Americas, and Eastern European People's Democratic countries, as well as their thought-provoking and artistically valuable works, are not included in this syllabus.
    This tendency to overemphasize the ancient and underestimate the modern is not only reflected in the content of the teaching syllabus but also in the teachers' classroom teaching and daily conversations. Teachers constantly refer to Greece and Rome, and disdain to talk about famous modern, especially contemporary, foreign literature writers and works. Teachers are conducting teaching based on bourgeois idealistic viewpoints and bourgeois teaching ideas. A professor at Southwest Normal College, while lecturing on Petrarch's sonnets, spent class time researching the year, month, and day Petrarch's "ideal" lover Laura was born, the year, month, and day she married, the year, month, and day Petrarch met her in what place, and the year, month, and day Petrarch lived with another woman after she married, etc. However, he did not teach and analyze the content and form of the sonnets well, so that after the class, students did not even understand what a sonnet was. There are many more examples like this. Now is the time to correct this tendency. Liu Qizhen

### 外国文学教学中的厚古薄今

    外国文学教学中的厚古薄今
    现在师范学院中文系使用的“外国文学教学大纲”存在着严重的厚古薄今的倾向。
    这个教学大纲规定的外国文学讲授内容分为四个部分：（一）古代到十八世纪的外国文学；　（二）十九世纪的外国文学（不包括俄罗斯文学）；　（三）十九世纪俄罗斯文学；（四）苏联文学。许多近代的、当代的西欧、美洲和东欧人民民主国家的著名作家及富有思想性、艺术性的作品都没有列入这个大纲内。
    这种厚古薄今的倾向，不但体现在教学大纲的内容上，也体现在教师的课堂教学及日常言谈中，教师言必称希腊、罗马，对近代的尤其是当代的外国文学的著名作家、作品则不屑一谈。教师是以资产阶级唯心论的观点和资产阶级的教学思想来进行教学的。西南师范学院有一位教授在讲授佩特拉克的十四行诗时，却在课堂上考证佩特拉克的“理想”的爱人洛拉是何年何月何日生，何年何月何日嫁，佩特拉克何年何月何日在何地与她见面，她嫁后佩特拉克在何年何月何日与另一女人同居等等。而对十四行诗的内容和形式却没有很好地进行讲授和分析，致使课后学生连什么是十四行诗也不懂。像这样的例子还很多。现在是到了应该纠正这种倾向的时候了。　刘启真
