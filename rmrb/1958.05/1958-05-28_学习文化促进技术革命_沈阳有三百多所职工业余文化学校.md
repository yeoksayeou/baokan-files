    Learning Culture Promotes Technological Revolution
    Shenyang Has More Than 300 Staff and Worker Amateur Cultural Schools
    (Our newspaper dispatch) Reporter Yao Guizhi reports: In the great leap forward in education, Shenyang city authorities have placed great emphasis on staff and worker spare-time education. Currently, the city already has 303 staff and worker amateur cultural schools, including nine amateur universities. These schools have absorbed a wide range of workers to participate in learning, with more than 182,000 people regularly participating in learning. There are now nearly 2,000 full-time teachers. Over the past few years, under the leadership of the Party, spare-time education has already achieved great results.
    Shenyang city's staff and worker amateur schools are diverse, with universities including 28 majors and more than 4,000 people studying, as well as middle and primary schools. Due to the persistence of many workers in cultural learning, now more than 40,000 workers have graduated from spare-time primary schools, and more than 5,000 workers have graduated from spare-time middle schools in the city.
    After learning culture, many workers can read books and newspapers, calculate work and materials, and record work logs; and apply the principles they have learned to improve tools and techniques. Zhang Jiwen, a worker at the Shenyang Agricultural Machinery Factory, once applied the geometric principles he learned to improve five types of templates, one of which alone increased efficiency tenfold. Gu Chunliang, a worker at the same factory, persisted in cultural learning, consulted scientific and technological books, and improved tools such as the large clamps used on the frame of a 24-row seeder, increasing work efficiency fivefold.
    The improvement of workers' cultural level has created favorable conditions for learning political theory and technology. Gao Junfeng and Pu Yulin, civil servants at Shenyang Medical College, only had a primary school education in 1950. Due to their persistent cultural learning over the past few years, they have already graduated from spare-time high school and are working as technical assistants in the research office.
    Encouraged by the great leap forward in production and technological innovation, the enthusiasm of workers for learning culture and technology has become even higher.

    学习文化促进技术革命
    沈阳有三百多所职工业余文化学校
    本报讯　记者姚桂芝报道：沈阳市有关部门在教育大跃进中，很重视职工业余教育。现在全市已有职工业余文化学校三百零三所，其中有业余大学九所。这些学校吸收广大的职工参加学习，经常参加学习的有十八万二千多人。现在有专职教师近二千人。业余教育几年来，在党的领导下，已经收到很大成绩。
    沈阳市职工业余学校是多种多样的，大学有包括二十八个专业，四千多人学习，还有中、小学。由于许多职工坚持文化学习，现在全市业余小学毕业的职工有四万多人，业余中学毕业的职工有五千多人。
    许多职工，学习了文化之后，能看书看报、算工算料、记工作日志；并运用所学到的原理，改进工具和技术。沈阳农业机械厂工人张继文，曾经运用学到的几何原理，改进了五种样板，其中仅一种就提高效率十倍。该厂工人顾春亮坚持文化学习，参考科学技术书籍，改进了二十四行播种机大架子上使用的大卡子等工具，提高工作效率五倍。
    职工文化水平的提高，给学习政治理论和技术创造了有利的条件。沈阳医学院公务员高俊丰和朴玉林，在1950年只有高小文化程度，由于几年来一直坚持文化学习，已经由业余高中毕业，担任研究室的技术助理工作。
    在生产大跃进和技术革新的鼓舞下，职工们学文化、学技术的积极性更加高涨。
