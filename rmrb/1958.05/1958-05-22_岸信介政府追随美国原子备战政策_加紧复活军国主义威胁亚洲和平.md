Xinhua News Agency, May 21st, Tokyo dispatch: The Director of the European and African Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Kanayama, submitted an unsigned memorandum to the Counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Japan, Adirkhayev, on the 17th, as the Kishi Nobusuke government's response to the Soviet government's note of the 15th.

In its note submitted to the Japanese Foreign Ministry on the 15th, the Soviet government pointed out that Japanese newspapers had published news that there were no nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons delivery systems within Japan. The Japanese government had not refuted the aforementioned news in Japanese newspapers, indicating that the news was well-founded. The note pointed out that measures regarding the establishment of nuclear weapons and the entry of aircraft and rockets carrying and launching nuclear weapons into Japan would pose a threat to peace and security in the Far East, and the Soviet Union cannot ignore this situation. The note expressed the hope that the Japanese government would clarify whether the claim that nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons delivery systems have been transported into Japanese territory is consistent with the actual situation.

In its memorandum of the 17th, the Japanese Foreign Ministry denied that the Kishi Nobusuke government had permitted the entry of nuclear weapons into Japan, and insisted that the Soviet government's note was "groundless."

However, on the same day, the Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Mosaburo Suzuki, when speaking in Ichiba City, Chiba Prefecture, on the Soviet note, said, "Everyone is worried that the Kishi Nobusuke cabinet may form a united front with the United States, allowing US troops stationed in Japan to be equipped with nuclear weapons." He also revealed, "Now there are rumors that an underground strategic base is being built in Chitose, Hokkaido, and people can clearly see the scene of new recruits being equipped." Suzuki demanded that the Kishi Nobusuke government explicitly declare to the Japanese people that Japan will not be equipped with nuclear weapons and will not build missile bases.

Pulling Japan into the US Atomic Strategic System
    Facts have proven that after becoming Prime Minister of Japan, Kishi Nobusuke actively colluded with the United States, intensified efforts to pull Japan into the US atomic strategic system, and used US support to intensify rearmament and the restoration of Japanese militarism. Kishi Nobusuke's actions in this regard demonstrate the imperialist ambition of this Japanese reactionary politician, who committed serious war crimes during the war, to violate the interests of the Japanese nation and rely on the United States to make a comeback.

Shortly after taking office, Kishi Nobusuke traveled to Washington in June last year with a series of military expansion plans to consult with US President Eisenhower. The basic principle of these plans is that Japan "must rearm itself on the basis of a security system with the United States." According to reports, Kishi Nobusuke discussed the issue of transporting nuclear weapons into Japan with Eisenhower. Currently, in addition to the missile base on Okinawa, there are US B-47 bombers carrying atomic bombs patrolling in Japanese airspace, and US "Honest John" rockets that can launch atomic warheads have been installed on Japanese soil. US fleets equipped with atomic weapons are also operating out of Japanese ports.

Although the Kishi Nobusuke government has tried its best to deny that the United States has transported atomic weapons into Japan in order to ease the strong opposition of the Japanese people and eliminate their fears, Kishi Nobusuke himself, on March 28, defended the United States transporting nuclear weapons into Japan under pressure from Socialist Party members on the House of Representatives Cabinet Committee, saying that according to the "Japan-US Security Treaty," the United States "has the right" to transport nuclear weapons into Japan. Tsushima Juichi, Director of the Japanese "Defense Agency," was also forced to admit that the United States had transported "Skyhawk" bombers capable of carrying atomic bombs into Japan. All the above facts show that Kishi Nobusuke is faithfully implementing the US's evil plan to turn Japan into its atomic base.

Equipping the "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons and other new weapons
    In order to follow the United States in conducting atomic war preparations, the Kishi Nobusuke government is also planning to expand and equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with nuclear weapons and other new weapons. According to the "Mainichi Shimbun," the Japanese "Defense Agency" has formulated a plan to equip the Japanese army with nuclear weapons from 1961 to 1965, and to establish a joint system of the Japanese sea, land, and air "Self-Defense Forces" to adapt to the development of new weapons such as missiles. The news pointed out that the characteristic of this plan is: to equip the Japanese "Self-Defense Forces" with new weapons such as "Nike" missiles and "Honest John" missiles that can be equipped with nuclear warheads when necessary by obtaining war materials from the US armed forces around Japan. In this regard, the United States has decided to supply Japan with "Sidewinder" air-to-air missiles. Japan has also requested the United States to supply Japan with six other types of missiles, "Honest John" rockets, and jet aircraft that can be equipped with missiles and rockets. Currently, in addition to establishing a missile base at the Tsuchiura Air Force Base in Ibaraki Prefecture, the Japanese "Defense Agency" has established a second missile base on Niijima Island outside Tokyo Bay.

At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government has allocated a huge amount of military spending of 120.6 billion yen in the Japanese budget for 1958. With the increase in military spending, the "Defense Agency" announced a plan to further expand the army to 180,000 men, the navy to 124,000 tons of ships, and the air force to 1,300 aircraft by the end of 1960.

In order to materially support the Kishi Nobusuke government's military expansion and war preparation plan, the Kishi Nobusuke government colluded with Japan's military industry monopoly capital, unscrupulously formulated plans to further develop the military industry, especially the production of modern weapons. In Japan's 1958 budget, the funds allocated for research and production of missiles alone amounted to 400 million yen. Recently, four organizations related to weapons manufacturing, including the "Defense Production Committee" of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), an organization of Japanese monopoly capital, and the "Japan Arms Industry Association," have made suggestions to the Kishi Nobusuke government to set up a "Missile Research and Development Council" in the cabinet and establish a "Missile Force" in the "Self-Defense Forces." Major Japanese arms manufacturers such as New Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Kawasaki Aircraft have long announced that they will produce missiles on a large scale. The heavy industry controlled by monopoly capital may be fully reorganized when necessary to serve the new imperialist military expansion of Kishi Nobusuke and his group of militarists.

Instilling militaristic ideas in young people
    On the other hand, the Kishi Nobusuke government has stepped up the implementation of a system of education aimed at restoring militarism. According to reports, the Japanese Cabinet Investigation Office made a decision as early as February last year that it was necessary to step up militaristic education and propaganda. The Japanese Cabinet Investigation Office believes that the Japanese people strongly oppose rearmament because they have experienced the tragedy of war. Therefore, the Kishi Nobusuke government decided to strengthen militaristic education that would enhance the "national consciousness" and "national defense consciousness" of the new generation who have not personally experienced the war, and to forcibly instill "moral education" with militaristic ideas into them. On February 6 this year, the ruling Liberal Democratic Party openly proposed to the Diet to restore February 11 (the day Emperor Jimmu ascended the throne) as "Kigensetsu (Empire Day)," attempting to revive the Emperor worship, the pillar of militarism. By April, the Kishi Nobusuke government colluded with the United States to unilaterally announce the final release of Araki Sadao and other ten Class A war criminals through some countries that participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, in order to accelerate the restoration of militarist forces.

Kishi Nobusuke's frantic war planning for rearmament not only violates the Allied decision that Japan should not rearm, but also violates Japan's postwar constitution prohibiting Japan from possessing war-making capabilities. In order to clear the obstacles on the road to rearmament, Kishi Nobusuke has been plotting to revise the constitution since he took office. The "Constitutional Investigation Committee" established to amend the constitution was officially established on August 13 last year.

Deliberately engaging in military expansion in Asia
    It should be emphasized that Kishi Nobusuke's pursuit of the US policy of military expansion and war preparation and the restoration of militarism is by no means for Japan's "self-defense," as he claims, but hides the imperialist purpose of following the United States to oppose the Soviet Union and China and to engage in military expansion in other parts of Asia. In fact, since March this year, the Kishi Nobusuke government has openly studied whether sending troops abroad to "assist in maintaining international peace" violates the constitution. Kyodo News Agency said that the Kishi Nobusuke government is "increasingly inclined to believe that sending troops abroad does not violate the constitution."

At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government vigorously promoted the militaristic argument that "Japan has a large population and a small land area, and must expand abroad." In the "White Paper" published by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 1957, it was openly declared that Japan lost 46% of its "territory" (referring to the territories of China and other Asian countries that Japan occupied before the war) after the war. Under the current situation of Japan's increasing population, making Japanese people "migrate" overseas will be Japan's "important policy." This situation shows that Kishi Nobusuke is dreaming of following the path of aggression of the old Japanese militarists.

In this regard, Kishi Nobusuke has not only consistently taken a hostile stance toward the Chinese people, but also harbors imperialist ambitions for Taiwan, the territory of the Chinese people once occupied by Japan. On the one hand, the Kishi Nobusuke government actively followed the US in plotting the "two Chinas" conspiracy, and at the same time, it sheltered the traitor Liao Wenyi in Japan to establish the so-called "Taiwan Independence League." Some figures in the Japanese ruling clique are also spreading the fallacy that "Taiwan should be returned to Japan" under the domination of the ambition to re-seize Taiwan.

In recent times, the United States' plot to establish a "Northeast Asia Alliance" aggressive bloc including Japan, the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and the Lee Seung-man group, is being actively lobbied by Kishi Nobusuke for implementation. In this regard, Kishi Nobusuke did not hesitate to tear up the Fourth China-Japan Trade Agreement to please the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek group, and stepped up collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek group. At the same time, the Kishi Nobusuke government resumed the "Japan-South Korea talks," which had been interrupted for four years, with the Lee Seung-man group from the end of last year, in an attempt to "normalize relations" between Japan and the Lee Seung-man group. According to the "Tokyo Shimbun," in order to win over the Lee Seung-man group, Kishi Nobusuke has promised to give Lee Seung-man a portion of the treasures looted from Korea by Japan during the war. In April this year, Turkish Prime Minister Menderes, in the capacity of representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Baghdad Pact Organization, traveled to Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea to carry out activities on piecing together the "Northeast Asia Alliance" aggressive bloc, and attempted to link this "Northeast Asia Alliance" aggressive bloc with the three existing aggressive military blocs manipulated by Western countries. Kishi Nobusuke's active participation in the US's conspiracy to establish a new military bloc in the Asian region exposes Kishi Nobusuke's evil attempt to actively follow the United States to undermine Asian peace and security, oppose the Soviet Union and China, and carry out military expansion against other Asian countries.

The Japanese people oppose the implementation of military expansion policies
    However, the Japanese people, who have suffered from Japanese militarism and greatly raised their awareness after the war, firmly oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of dragging Japan into the US atomic strategic system and attempting to carry out military expansion. On the eve of this general election, the Japanese people have set off a new upsurge in the struggle for peace, democracy, and independence against the San Francisco "Peace Treaty" system, against turning Japan into a nuclear weapons base, against amending the constitution, and against overthrowing the Kishi Nobusuke government. The Japanese Communist Party issued a statement on April 11 opposing the United States transporting nuclear weapons into Japan and establishing missile bases in Japan. The Japanese Socialist Party also issued two declarations on May 13 and 19 regarding prohibiting Japan from conducting nuclear armament and prohibiting the transport of nuclear weapons into Japan.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's activities of following the US atomic war preparation policy and reviving Japanese militarism threaten the peace and security of China and Asia. The Chinese people suffered extremely serious harm from Japanese militarists during World War II. However, the Japanese government has not yet accounted to the Chinese people for the responsibilities that Japan should bear for its past war of aggression. On the contrary, the Kishi Nobusuke government, which is frantically engaging in military expansion and war preparation and restoring Japanese militarism, has intensified its hostile attitude towards the Chinese people. This cannot but arouse the serious vigilance and indignation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people, who have stood up, and the people of other Asian countries who have suffered from Japanese aggression, will never allow Kishi Nobusuke to follow the United States in carrying out new imperialist military expansion in the Asian region.

    岸信介政府追随美国原子备战政策
    加紧复活军国主义威胁亚洲和平
    新华社21日讯　东京消息：日本外务省欧非局长金山在17日向苏联驻日本大使馆参赞阿迪尔哈耶夫提交了一份不署名的备忘录，作为岸信介政府对苏联政府15日的照会的答复。
    苏联政府在15日提交日本外务省的照会中指出，日本报纸刊载了关于日本境内没有核武器和发射核武器的工具的消息。日本官方没有对日本报纸的上述消息辟谣，可见这些消息是有根据的。照会指出，关于在日本境内设有核武器以及载运和发射核武器的飞机和火箭的措施会造成对和平和远东安全的威胁，苏联不能忽视这种情况。照会表示希望日本政府说明，关于有核武器和发射核武器的工具运入日本领土的说法是否合乎实际情况。
    日本外务省在17日的备忘录中，否认岸信介政府已经准许把核武器运进日本国内，并且硬说苏联政府的照会“没有根据”。
    但是，就在同一天，日本社会党委员长铃木茂三郎在千叶县市场市就苏联的照会发表谈话时说，“谁都担心岸信介内阁可能同美国组成联合战线，让驻在日本的美军用核武器来进行装备。”他还揭露说，“现在传说在北海道的千岁正在建设地下战略基地，人们可以清楚地看到正在装备新兵的情景。”铃木要求岸信介政府在日本人民面前明确宣布，日本不用核武器进行装备，不建设导弹基地。
  把日本拖进美国的原子战略体制
    事实证明，岸信介在当上日本首相以后，就积极勾结美国，加紧把日本拖进美国的原子战略体制，并且借助美国的支持加紧重整军备和恢复日本的军国主义。岸信介在这方面的所作所为，表明了这个在战时犯有严重战争罪行的日本反动政客企图违反日本的民族利益，依靠美国东山再起的帝国主义野心。
    岸信介在上台后不久，随即在去年6月间携带一系列的扩军计划前往华盛顿向美国总统艾森豪威尔请示。这些计划的基本方针是：日本“要以同美国在一起的安全体系为基础”来重整军备。有消息说，岸信介曾经同艾森豪威尔讨论了关于把核武器运进日本的问题。目前，美国除了在冲绳岛设有导弹基地以外，在日本领土上空有携带着原子弹的美国B—四七型轰炸机在巡逻，在日本的土地上已经安设了可以发射原子弹头的美国“诚实的约翰”式火箭，配备有原子武器的美国舰队也在以日本港口为基地进行活动。
    尽管岸信介政府为了缓和日本人民的强烈反对和消除他们的恐惧情绪，极力否认美国已经把原子武器运进日本，但是，岸信介本人3月28日在众议院内阁委员会上在社会党议员的逼问下也曾经为美国把核武器运进日本进行辩解，说什么根据“日美安全条约”美国“有权”把核武器运进日本。日本“防卫厅”长官津岛寿一也曾经被迫承认，美国已经把能够携带原子弹的“空中之鹰”式轰炸机运进日本。上述种种事实表明，岸信介正在忠实地执行着美国把日本变成它的原子基地的罪恶计划。用核武器等新型武器武装“自卫队”
    为了追随美国进行原子备战，岸信介政府还在计划扩充和用核武器等新型武器武装日本“自卫队”。据“每日新闻”透露，日本“防卫厅”已经拟定了使日本军队在从1961年到1965年期间进行核武装，并且建立日本海、陆、空三个“自卫队”的联合体系的计划，以适应导弹等新型武器的发展。消息指出，这个计划的特点在于：通过从日本四周的美国武装部队那里取得战争物资的办法，用在必要时可以装上核弹头的“奈克”式导弹和“诚实的约翰”式导弹等新型武器来装备日本“自卫队”。在这方面，美国已经决定供给日本“响尾蛇”式空空导弹。日本还向美国提出供给日本其它六种类型的导弹、“诚实的约翰”式火箭以及可以装备导弹和火箭的喷气式飞机的要求。目前，日本“防卫厅”除了在茨城县土浦空军基地建立了一个导弹基地以外，又在东京湾外的新岛上建立第二个导弹基地。
    与此同时，岸信介政府在日本的1958年度预算中拨出一千二百亿六千万日元的巨额军费。在军费开支增加了的情况下，“防卫厅”宣布了到1960年底进一步把陆军扩充到十八万人、海军船只扩充到十二万四千吨、空军扩充到拥有飞机一千三百架的计划。
    为了从物质上支持岸信介政府的扩军备战计划，岸信介政府同日本的军火工业垄断资本进行勾结，肆无忌惮地制定了进一步发展军火工业、特别是生产现代武器的计划。在日本1958年度的预算中，只是拨作研究和生产导弹的费用就有四亿日元。最近，日本垄断资本的组织经济团体联合会“防卫生产委员会”和“日本武器工业会”等同制造武器有关的四个团体已经向岸信介政府提出建议，要在内阁里设置“研究发展导弹审议会”，并且在“自卫队”里建立“导弹部队”。日本的大军火商新三菱重工业公司和川崎飞机公司等早就宣布要大规模地生产导弹。而掌握在垄断资本手中的重工业有可能在必要时全面进行改组，为岸信介这批军国主义者进行新的帝国主义军事扩张服务。
    对青年灌输军国主义思想
    另一方面，岸信介政府加紧推行了恢复军国主义的教育制度。有消息说，日本内阁调查室早在去年2月就作出了必需加紧进行军国主义教育与宣传的决定。日本内阁调查室认为，日本人民由于体验过战争的悲剧，所以强烈地反对重整军备。因此，岸信介政府决定对没有亲身体验过战争的新的一代加强使他们提高“民族意识”和“国防意识”的军国主义教育，强制向他们灌输军国主义思想的“道德教育”。今年2月6日，执政的自由民主党公然向国会提出把2月11日（神武天皇登基日）恢复为“纪元节”，企图复活军国主义支柱的天皇迷信。到了4月，岸信介政府勾结美国，通过参加远东国际军事法庭的一些国家，片面宣布最后释放荒木贞夫等十名甲级战犯，以加速恢复军国主义势力。
    岸信介疯狂进行重整军备的战争策划不仅违反盟国间关于日本不得进行重新武装的决定，也违背了战后日本的关于禁止日本拥有战争力量的宪法。为了扫清重新武装道路上的障碍，岸信介上台以后，就阴谋着手修改宪法。为了修改宪法而设置的“宪法调查会”已经在去年8月13日正式成立。
    蓄意在亚洲进行军事扩张
    应该着重指出的是，岸信介追随美国执行扩军备战和恢复军国主义的计划，决不是像他所宣扬的是为了日本的“自卫”，而是在背后隐藏着追随美国以反对苏联和中国并且在亚洲其他地区进行军事扩张的帝国主义目的。事实上，从今年3月开始，岸信介政府就公开地研究派兵出国“协助维持国际和平”是否违反宪法的问题。共同社说，岸信介政府“愈来愈倾向于认为派兵出国并不违反宪法”。
    与此同时，岸信介政府极力宣扬所谓“日本人口多、国土少，必须向外扩张”的军国主义论调。日本外务省在1957年9月发表的“蓝皮书”中公然宣称，日本在战后失去46％的“国土”（指日本在战前侵占中国和其它亚洲国家的领土），在目前日本人口增加的情况下，使日本人向海外“移住”将是日本的“重要施策”。这种情况表明，岸信介正在梦想走日本老牌军国主义者的侵略道路。
    在这方面，岸信介不仅一贯采取敌视中国人民的立场，而且对曾经一度被日本侵占的中国人民的领土台湾抱有帝国主义野心。岸信介政府一方面积极追随美国策划“两个中国”的阴谋，同时还在日本掩护汉奸廖文毅建立所谓“台湾独立同盟”。日本统治集团中的一些人物还在重新攫取台湾的野心的支配下，散布“台湾应该归还日本”的谬论。
    最近一个时期以来，美国阴谋建立包括日本、台湾蒋介石集团和李承晚集团在内的“东北亚同盟”侵略集团的计划，正由岸信介积极拉拢奔走来酝酿实现中。在这方面，岸信介不惜撕毁第四次中日贸易协定以取悦台湾蒋介石集团，并且加紧同蒋介石集团进行勾搭。同时，岸信介政府同李承晚集团从去年年底起恢复了中断四年之久的“日韩谈判”，企图使日本同李承晚集团之间的“邦交正常化”。据“东京新闻”揭露，为了拉拢李承晚集团，岸信介已经许诺把战时日本从朝鲜掠夺去的财宝的一部分送给李承晚。今年4月，土耳其总理曼德列斯以北大西洋公约组织和巴格达条约组织代表的身份。前往日本、台湾和南朝鲜就拼凑“东北亚同盟”侵略集团问题进行活动，并且企图使这个“东北亚同盟”侵略集团同已经存在的西方国家操纵的三个侵略性军事集团联系起来。岸信介积极参与美国在亚洲地区建立新的军事集团的阴谋，暴露出岸信介积极追随美国来破坏亚洲和平及安全，反对苏联、中国并对其他亚洲国家实行军事扩张的罪恶企图。
  日本人民反对执行军事扩张政策
    但是，曾经身受日本军国主义祸害并且在战后大大提高了觉悟的日本人民，坚决反对岸信介政府把日本拖进美国原子战略体制和企图进行军事扩张的政策。在这次大选前夕，日本人民掀起了反对旧金山“和约”体制、反对把日本变成核武器基地、反对修改宪法和打倒岸信介政府的争取和平、民主、独立斗争的新的高潮。日本共产党曾经在4月11日发表声明，反对美国把核武器运进日本和在日本境内设置导弹基地。日本社会党也先后在5月13日和19日两次发表了关于禁止日本进行核武装和禁止把核武器运进日本的宣言。
    岸信介政府追随美国原子备战政策和复活日本军国主义的活动，威胁着中国和亚洲的和平和安全。中国人民在第二次世界大战中曾经遭受过日本军国主义者的极其严重的侵害。但是，日本政府到现在还没有向中国人民对日本在过去的侵略战争中，应负的责任作出交代。相反地，疯狂进行扩军备战和恢复日本军国主义的岸信介政府却变本加厉地采取了敌对中国人民的态度。这就不能不引起中国人民的严重警惕和愤慨。已经站起来的中国人民同其他曾经遭受日本侵略的亚洲各国人民，决不能容许岸信介追随美国在亚洲地区进行新的帝国主义军事扩张。
