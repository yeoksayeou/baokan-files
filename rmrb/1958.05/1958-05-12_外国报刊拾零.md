　　Foreign Press Clippings
    False "Prosperity"
    Facts show that the "middle class" (in the United States) actually does not own its own property. Only a very few families truly own their own homes. The rest of the homes are owned by banks, insurance companies, and credit companies. The vast majority of people are saddled with mortgage loans that take twenty or even thirty years to pay off. Many are struggling in installment payment debts for new cars and furniture that they will never be able to pay off in their lifetime.

    The Truth About American "Aid"
    The most criticism of (American) government foreign aid plans is that the government takes millions upon millions of dollars from the country and gives them to foreign countries.
    In fact, the vast majority of foreign aid funds are spent in the United States. To support this year's foreign aid proposal, the (American) government pointed out in a report that for every dollar of foreign aid appropriation, eighty cents are spent in the United States. The report said that this expenditure means jobs for 600,000 people in our factories and farms.

    虚假“繁荣”
    事实表明，（美国）的“中产阶级”实际上并没有自己的财产。只有极少数家庭有真正属于自己的住宅。其余的住宅的所有者是银行、保险公司和信贷公司。绝大部分人欠下了需要二十年乃至三十年才能还清的抵押贷款。许多人在一辈子也无法偿清的新汽车和家具的分期付款债务里挣扎。

    美“援”真相
    （美国）政府援外计划受到最多的指责，就是政府将国内的千千万万的美元拿去送给外国。
    事实上，绝大部分的援外基金是在美国用掉的。（美国）政府为了支持今年的援外提案，在一份报告中指出，每一美元的援外拨款，就有八角钱是在美国用掉的。报告说，这一笔开支，意味着在我们的工厂和农场六十万人的工作。
