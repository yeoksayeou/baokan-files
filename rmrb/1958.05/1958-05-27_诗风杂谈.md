    Random Talk on Poetic Style
  　Ding Li
    I.
    In recent years, poems that are easily remembered and liked by the broad masses of the people have become less common in the poetry scene than before. On the other hand, poems with a foreign student's tone and Europeanized long sentences have appeared frequently, and even several experts in writing long sentence poems have emerged. I don't think this is a good trend. This kind of Europeanized long sentence poem is not a form that the masses of people like to see. Although it can be considered a type of flower, it is not appreciated by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The April issue of "Poetry Journal" published the opinions of more than 20 workers on current poetry. Their criticism of Europeanized long sentence poems is completely correct. If the workers are like this, I think farmers and soldiers will be even less likely to like this type of poetry.
    The readers of this kind of Europeanized long sentence poem can only be a small number of intellectuals, and it has nothing to do with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Because they can't understand or hear it, the literary and artistic policy of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers has not been well implemented.
    This is not just a matter of language and form, but also a matter of whether the author has the ideological feelings of the working people and a mass viewpoint. A revolutionary poet, if he only serves a very small number of intellectuals with his poems, and does not serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, is very insufficient.
    II.
    Some comrades may say: "This kind of Europeanized long sentence poem is written for a small number of intellectuals, because college students and cadres from intellectual backgrounds also need to read poetry, and they are also the people."
    Poetry should also adhere to the direction of serving workers, peasants, and soldiers (including cadres from worker-peasant backgrounds and proletarianized intellectuals). Only works that truly serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers also serve the intellectuals. Moreover, this type of work is not generally liked by intellectuals, but only appreciated by a very small number of intellectuals who like foreign tones. Deviating from the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers to cater to the preferences of some intellectuals, and engaging in foreign stereotypes, cannot be considered truly serving the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    "This is improved poetry. Although the broad masses of working people can't understand it now, they will naturally be able to understand it when their cultural level improves in the future."
    This is even more incorrect. The working people can produce many good folk poems. However, some works by poets are not popular. Whose cultural level is higher? The reason why the masses don't understand Europeanized long sentence poems is mainly because there are still problems with your poetry writing. If your poems have to wait until the working people can understand them in the future, then they cannot serve today's reality. This kind of thinking of "hiding it in famous mountains and passing it on to future generations" is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality. Moreover, your so-called "improvement" is just your own hobby. It is not to improve on the basis of popularization, nor is it to improve along the forms that the working people like to see. Europeanized long sentence poems are not welcomed by the people now, and of course, they will not be welcomed by the people in the future!
    III.
    But the masses of the people don't care about this. Their songs are still endless, and a large number of folk songs and ballads are produced. Especially at present, the ballads reflecting the Great Leap Forward resound throughout the country. Their magnificent momentum and great influence are unprecedented in any historical era.
    Some people still don't pay enough attention to folk songs and ballads, and always think they are elementary things, "simple, rough, and hasty." There is no need to deny that folk songs and ballads have such shortcomings. But its basic aspect is good, and there are immeasurable wonderful things. "Guo Feng" is a folk ballad and a good poem. Qu Yuan was influenced by the folk songs of the State of Chu and produced the Sao style. The Yuefu poems of the Han, Wei, and Six Dynasties (referring to the folk song part) have many masterpieces, such as "Mulberry on the Path," "Peacock Flies Southeast," and "Ballad of Mulan." How can we generally say that they are simple, rough, and hasty? Moreover, this kind of Yuefu poetry (folk song) has always influenced many great poets after the Han and Wei Dynasties. In the Tang Dynasty and subsequent dynasties, new Yuefu poems were produced. The Tang Dynasty quatrains and later ci and qu were mostly derived from folk songs or influenced by folk songs. Each time the style of poetry changed throughout history, it was because new content broke through the old forms, and it was on the basis of classical poetry and folk poetry that new forms were developed and produced.
    Now, many poets have begun to rewrite folk ballad style poems, which is a good phenomenon. We must absorb the advantages of folk songs and improve and develop them. But this is not just a matter of language and form, it is mainly the result of a large number of poets going down to the countryside and immersing themselves in the lives of the masses, and their ideological feelings have changed. Going deep into life and transforming one's thinking are the main keys to changing poetic style.

    诗风杂谈
  　丁力
    一
    近年来的诗坛上，为广大人民所喜闻乐见的诗，容易记住，容易上口的诗，不如从前多了。另一方面，洋学生腔和欧化的长句子诗，却出现得很多，甚至出了几位写长句诗的专家。我认为这不是好的倾向，这类欧化的长句诗，不是人民大众所喜闻乐见的形式。虽说也算是一种花，但广大的工农兵是不欣赏的。四月号“诗刊”上发表了二十几位工人对目前诗歌的意见，他们对欧化的长句诗提出批评，是完全正确的，工人如此，我想农民和战士更不会喜欢这类诗了。
    这种欧化的长句诗的读者，只能是少数的知识分子，与广大工农兵是不相干的。因为他们看不懂，听不懂，这样，为工农兵服务的文艺方针，就没有很好的贯彻。
    这不仅是语言、形式的问题，同时，也是作者是否有劳动人民的思想感情和群众观点的问题。一个革命诗人，如果只以自己的诗为极少数的知识分子服务，而不为广大的工农兵服务，这是非常不够的。
    二
    有的同志会说：“这类欧化的长句诗，就是写给少数知识分子看的，因为大学生和知识分子出身的干部，也需要读诗，他们也是人民。”
    诗歌同样应该坚持工农兵方向（包括工农出身的干部和无产阶级化了的知识分子），只有真正为工农兵服务的作品，同时也就为知识分子服了务。何况这一类作品一般的知识分子并不爱读，只是极少数爱好洋腔洋调的知识分子欣赏而已。离开了工农兵方向去迁就某些知识分子的嗜好，搞些洋八股，那就不能算是真正为广大的工农兵服务了。
    “我这是提高了的诗，广大的劳动人民现在虽看不懂，等到将来他们的文化水平提高了，自然会看得懂的。”
    这更不对。劳动人民能够产生许多好的民间诗歌。而诗人的有些作品却不受欢迎。这究竟是谁的文化水平高呢？欧化的长句诗，群众之所以不懂，主要是你写诗还存在问题。你的诗要等到将来劳动人民才能看懂，那就不能为今天的现实服务了。这种“藏之名山，传之后世”的思想，是脱离群众、脱离现实的。况且你的所谓“提高”，只不过是你自己的癖好罢了，并不是在普及的基础上来提高，并不是沿着劳动人民所喜闻乐见的形式来提高。欧化的长句诗，不为现在的人民所欢迎，当然更不会为将来的人民所欢迎！
    三
    但人民大众不理这一套，他们的歌声依然不绝，民歌民谣大量产生，特别是目前，反映大跃进的歌谣，响遍全国，气魄之雄壮，声势之浩大，更是任何历史时代所没有的。
    有的人对民歌民谣还不够重视，总认为是初级的东西，“简单、粗糙、草率”。不必否认，民歌民谣中有这样的缺点。但它的基本方面，是好的，有不可计量的精采的东西。“国风”是民间歌谣，是好诗。屈原受了楚国民歌的影响，而产生了骚体，汉魏六朝的乐府诗（指民歌部分），有很多杰作，如“陌上桑”、“孔雀东南飞”、“木兰词”之类，怎能笼统地说它们简单、粗糙、草率呢？而且这种乐府诗（民歌）一直影响到汉魏以后的许多大诗人。在唐及唐以后各朝都有新乐府产生，唐代绝句及后来的词，曲，起初也多是来自民歌或受了民歌的影响而形成的。历代每一次诗风的改变，都是由于新的内容突破了旧的形式，都是在古典诗歌和民间诗歌的基础上，发展并产生了新的形式。
    现在，有不少诗人都开始改写民谣体诗了，这是好的现象。我们一定要吸收民歌的优点，加以提高、发展。但这不仅仅是语言、形式问题，主要是大批诗人下放，深入群众生活，思想感情有了变化的结果。深入生活，改造思想，是改变诗风的主要关键。
