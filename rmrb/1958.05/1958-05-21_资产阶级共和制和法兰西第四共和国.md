    Bourgeois Republic and
    The French Fourth Republic
    Question: What is a bourgeois republic? What was the process of France establishing a republic four times? Reader: Liu Zhongyan
    Answer: Bourgeois states have two types: constitutional monarchy and republic. The head of state in a constitutional monarchy is hereditary, such as in the United Kingdom; the head of state in a republic is elected and has a fixed term, such as in France and the United States. There are also two types of republics: parliamentary and presidential. A parliamentary government is composed of the party or parties that hold a majority in parliament, and is responsible to parliament according to the constitution, such as in France. The composition of a presidential government does not depend on the number of seats held by parties in parliament, nor is it responsible to parliament, such as in the United States.
    The First French Republic was established in 1792. The French bourgeoisie launched a revolution in 1789, abolished the feudal system, and issued the Declaration of the Rights of Man; they promulgated a constitution in 1791, but did not seize power until 1792.
    On April 20, 1792, France declared war on Austria and Prussia, and suffered successive defeats. Austrian and Prussian troops invaded France. The entire French people rose up to meet the enemy, defended Paris, and on August 10th overthrew the Louis XVI dynasty. On September 21st, they elected a National Convention, declared the abolition of the monarchy, and established the First French Republic under the rule of the bourgeoisie. In 1804, Napoleon declared himself emperor, and France restored the monarchy.
    In 1848, the people of Paris held an uprising, the February Revolution broke out, King Louis-Philippe was driven out of Paris, the monarchy was overthrown, and a provisional government of the bourgeoisie was established, which declared the establishment of the Second French Republic. On December 2, 1852, Napoleon III declared himself emperor, again destroying the republic and establishing the Second French Empire.
    Napoleon III was captured in the war against Prussia in 1870, and the Second French Empire collapsed. The French working class launched a revolution and established the world's first proletarian regime—the Paris Commune—in 1871. After the failure of the Paris Commune, reactionary forces in France were rampant. The reactionaries, who held a majority in the National Assembly, tried to restore the monarchy, and the Catholic Church also supported the reactionaries. However, French workers and peasants resolutely opposed it. The bourgeois party—the Republican Party—opposed the restoration of the monarchy. In 1875, after fierce debate, the National Assembly finally passed the constitution by a majority of one vote. According to this constitution, France became a parliamentary republic, historically known as the Third Republic. The Third Republic ceased to exist in 1940 when France surrendered to Hitler's Germany.
    After Hitler's Germany was crushed, French reactionaries rallied around the provisional government led by the "Popular Republican Movement" and right-wing socialists. Due to the repeated obstruction of the bourgeois government, the Constituent Assembly did not pass the new draft constitution until September 1946, which was approved by a national referendum on October 13. The new constitution declared France to be a secular democratic republic, forming the French Federation together with "overseas territories" (colonies). The French Fourth Republic was established.

    资产阶级共和制和
    法兰西第四共和国
    问：什么是资产阶级国家共和制？法兰西四次成立共和国的经过怎样？　　　　　读者　刘中延
    答：资产阶级国家有君主立宪制和共和制两种。君主立宪制的国家元首是世袭的，如英国；共和制的国家元首则是选举产生的，并且有一定任期，如法国、美国。共和制又有议会制和总统制两种。议会制政府由在议会中占多数的政党或合起来在议会中占多数的几个政党组成，根据宪法规定对议会负责，如法国。总统制政府的组成，则不取决于议会中政党所占的席位，它也不对议会负责，如美国。
    法兰西第一共和国是在1792年建立的。法国资产阶级于1789年爆发革命，废除了封建制度，发表了人权宣言；1791年颁布宪法，但直到1792年才取得了政权。
    1792年4月20日，法国对奥国和普鲁士宣战，连续打了败仗。奥国和普鲁士军队侵入了法国。全法国人民奋起迎击敌人，保卫了巴黎，并在8月10日推翻了路易十六王朝，于9月21日选出了国民大会，宣布废除君主政体，建立了资产阶级当政的法兰西第一共和国，到了1804年，拿破仑称帝，法国又恢复了君主政体。
    1848年巴黎人民举行起义，爆发了二月革命，把国王路易·腓立普赶出了巴黎，推翻了君主政权，成立了资产阶级的临时政府，由临时政府宣告法兰西第二共和国成立。1852年12月2日，拿破仑三世称帝，又覆灭了共和国，建立了法兰西第二帝国。
    拿破仑三世在1870年同普鲁士作战中被俘，法兰西第二帝国崩溃。法国工人阶级爆发革命，在1871年创立了世界上第一个无产阶级政权——巴黎公社。巴黎公社失败后，法国反动势力十分嚣张。在国民议会中占多数的反动派力图恢复君主政体，同时天主教会也支持反动派。但是法国的工人和农民坚决反对。资产阶级政党——共和党，反对恢复君主政体。1875年，国民议会经过剧烈争论后，终于以一票的多数通过了宪法，根据这个宪法，法国成为议会制共和国，在历史上称为第三共和国。直到1940年法国投降希特勒德国，第三共和国又告复亡。
    希特勒德国被粉碎后，法国反动派在以“人民共和党”和右翼社会党人为领导的临时政府周围集结起来。由于资产阶级政府的百般阻挠，直到1946年9月，立宪会议才通过了新宪法草案，10月13日为全民投票所批准。新宪法宣布法国为世俗的民主共和国，同“海外领土”（殖民地）一起组成法兰西联邦。法兰西第四共和国成立了。
