Let Molten Steel and Iron Water Surge Everywhere
More Than Twenty Types of Small Steel Plant Standard Designs Released
    (Our dispatch) To meet the needs of local development of the metallurgical industry, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry concentrated a portion of its design forces to carry out various types of standardized designs based on the plant construction conditions of counties and special districts. At the end of March, they completed the standardized design of a 100-cubic-meter blast furnace, and in April they completed more than twenty standardized designs ahead of schedule, including small steel joint ventures with annual outputs of 100,000 tons, 50,000 tons, 30,000 tons, 20,000 tons, 10,000 tons, and 6,000 tons, as well as small blast furnaces of 3, 8, 13, 28, and 55 cubic meters, and four types of converters with capacities of half a ton, one ton, one and a half tons, and three tons; five types of steel rolling equipment with annual outputs of 5,000 tons, 10,000 tons, 30,000 tons, 50,000 tons, and 100,000 tons of wire rod; and a thin plate factory with an annual output of 20,000 tons. Because the designers broke with conventions and simplified design procedures and content, they completed the design of a seamless steel tube plant with an annual output of 7,000 tons in only fifty days. In the past, this design required about a year from the approval of the preliminary design plan to the completion of the technical construction design.
    In order to better support the local development of the metallurgical industry, the Black Metallurgy Design Institute, in addition to continuing to undertake the new engineering projects requested by various provinces and cities, has also decided to take the following measures: First, to provide technical guidance for the construction of small and medium-sized steel plants in various regions. Second, to regularly send people to various provinces and cities to understand the production situation of small and medium-sized steel plants, summarize experience, and enrich and revise the standardized designs to make them more practical. According to the information recently learned by the comrades of the design institute who went to Funing, Hebei Province, the investment in the standardized design of some small factories can still be reduced. For example, Party A and Party B expenses and other expenses can be cancelled; many of the welfare facilities for employees can be shared with farmers; local materials can be used extensively, and a large amount of old materials can be used, and so on. Third, in order to create convenient conditions for various provinces and cities, the design institute has contacted the Ministry of Machinery Industry to standardize and standardize the various equipment needed by local small and medium-sized steel plants as much as possible to facilitate ordering by various provinces and cities.

    让钢水铁水到处奔腾
    二十多种小钢铁厂定型设计出世
    本报讯　冶金工业部黑色冶金设计总院为满足地方发展冶金工业的需要，集中了一部分设计力量，根据县和专区的建厂条件，进行各种类型的定型设计。他们在3月底完成了容量为一百立方公尺的高炉的定型设计，4月份又提前完成了二十多种定型设计，包括年产十万吨、五万吨、三万吨、二万吨、一万吨和六千吨的小型钢铁联合企业和三、八、十三、二十八、五十五立方公尺小高炉以及容量为半吨、一吨、一吨半和三吨的四种转炉；年产五千吨、一万吨、三万吨、五万吨和十万吨线材的五种轧钢设备；年产二万吨的薄板厂等。由于设计人员打破了陈规戒律，简化设计程序和内容，只用五十天时间，就完成了年产七千吨的无缝钢管厂的设计。过去这项设计从初步设计方案批准到做完技术施工设计需要一年左右。
    黑色冶金设计总院为了更好地支援地方发展冶金工业，除了继续担任各省市要求设计的新工程项目外，并且决定采取以下措施：一、对各地中小型钢铁厂的建设进行技术指导。二、定期派人去各省市了解中小型钢铁厂的生产情况，总结经验，以充实和修改定型设计，使之更切合实际。据最近设计院去河北省抚宁的同志所了解的情况，现在一些小厂的定型设计投资还可以降低。如甲、乙方费用和其他费用可以取消；职工的生活福利设施有很多可以和农民共用；可以就地取材，大量利用旧料等等。三、为了给各省市创造便利条件，设计院和机械工业部联系，尽量把地方中小型钢厂所需要的各种设备定型化、标准化，以便利各省市订货。
