Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 27th: Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction department employees, under the conditions of accelerating construction speed and ensuring product output, quality, variety, and production safety, have recently saved over 60 million yuan in basic construction investment in just over a month, accounting for about 17% of this year's total basic construction investment. This is a major achievement of the employees' comprehensive implementation of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism."

In the past few years, Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction work has made great achievements. However, due to the failure to fully implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, conservatism and waste phenomena were still very serious. In this "Double-Anti" movement, the Anshan Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party led the employees to launch a mass movement to salvage waste, tap potential, and comprehensively implement the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, in conjunction with the large-scale rectification, major reforms, and major debates. The employees of the East Anshan Comprehensive Construction Site, with close cooperation in all aspects, proposed more than 1,000 suggestions in the movement to reduce project costs, increase production capacity, and shorten the construction period. After these suggestions were debated and adopted, 15% of the total equipment was reduced, the production system was adjusted, and the ore preparation plant, which had already been under large-scale construction, saved more than 11 million yuan in investment, increasing the handling capacity of ore from the original design of 5.5 million tons to 7.5 million tons, and advancing the completion time by six months. Employees at the rolling mill construction site revised design projects that deviated from national conditions, adjusted equipment, and took other measures in this movement, enabling a rolling mill to increase its production capacity by 50% and advance the construction period by five months while saving more than 13 million yuan in investment. Employees at the steelmaking comprehensive construction site also adopted roughly similar methods to those of other construction sites, saving more than 5 million yuan in investment and shortening the construction period by two months in the case of most of the projects were entering the final stage, and closely cooperated with relevant parties to greatly increase the annual production capacity of each open-hearth furnace.

Through this movement, the thinking of the broad masses of Anshan Iron and Steel's basic construction workers has been further liberated, and they have been inspired with greater revolutionary zeal. Combat slogans such as "Rocket speed in progress, quality guaranteed for ten thousand years, save raw materials, and ensure construction safety" have emerged at various construction sites, and new inventions and creations, and examples of hard work are constantly emerging. The First Mining Company has introduced 56 technical innovations in the first half of May, increasing work efficiency by one to seven times.

Due to the advancement of the construction period and the saving of funds, Anshan Iron and Steel's steel and steel production this year will increase more than originally planned, and it is possible to use the saved funds to build another batch of projects. It has been decided to build a large blast furnace and many small blast furnaces, a large open-hearth furnace, a coke oven, and many soaking furnaces, gas generators, etc. Several small blast furnaces are already under construction, and the large blast furnace can be officially started in June. The addition of these projects will play a great role in ensuring that Anshan Iron and Steel achieves the goal of "halving investment and doubling steel production" during the Second Five-Year Plan period.

After the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China reached this steel base, it further encouraged the broad masses of employees' confidence and determination to implement the general line of socialist construction. A deputy manager in charge of basic construction work said that in the past, due to their insufficient and incomplete understanding and implementation of the policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, conservatism and waste were generated in construction; recently, after rectification and further study of the general line of socialist construction proposed by the Central Committee, many of them have gotten rid of the shackles of conservative thinking, dogmatism, and empiricism, and have begun to comprehensively implement this general line in their work, and an unprecedented leap forward has appeared in construction. Their experience proves that only by giving prominence to politics, following the mass line, and comprehensively implementing the general line of socialist construction can construction have a leap forward development.

### “进度赛火箭　质量保万年”  鞍钢一个多月节约投资六千多万元

    “进度赛火箭　质量保万年”
    鞍钢一个多月节约投资六千多万元
    新华社鞍山27日电　鞍钢基本建设部门职工在加快施工速度、保证产品产量、质量、品种和生产安全的条件下，最近一个多月来已经节约基本建设投资六千多万元，占今年基本建设投资总数17％左右。这是职工们全面贯彻鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的一个重大成果。
    过去几年来，鞍钢的基本建设工作已经取得很大成绩。但是由于没有全面贯彻多快好省的方针，保守和浪费现象仍然很严重。在这次“双反”运动中，中共鞍山市委领导职工群众，结合大整大改大辩论，展开了一个抢救浪费、挖掘潜力、全面贯彻多快好省方针的群众性运动。东鞍山综合工地的职工们，在各方面密切配合下，在运动中提出了一千多项降低工程造价、提高生产能力、缩短工期的建议。这些建议经过辩论采纳以后，减少了占设备总数15％的设备，调整了生产系统，使已经大量施工的矿石准备总厂节约投资一千一百多万元，处理矿石能力由原设计五百五十万吨提高到七百五十万吨，并且把竣工时间提前了半年。轧钢工地的职工们在这个运动中修改脱离国情的设计项目，调整设备，以及采取其它一些措施，使一个轧钢厂在节约投资一千三百多万元的情况下，提高生产能力50％，工期提前了五个月。炼钢综合工地的职工们也采取了同其它工地大体相似的办法，在绝大部分工程进入收尾阶段的情况下，节约投资五百多万元，缩短工期两个月，并且同有关方面密切合作，使每座平炉的年产能力大大提高。
    经过这一运动，鞍钢广大基本建设职工思想进一步解放，鼓起了更大的革命干劲。在各工地上出现了“进度赛火箭、质量保万年，节约原材料，施工保安全”等战斗口号，新的创造发明、大干苦干的事例不断涌现。第一矿山公司在5月份上半个月内就革新技术五十六项，使工作效率提高一倍到七倍。
    由于工期提前，资金节约，鞍钢今年的钢和钢材产量都将比原计划增加，而且有可能用节约下来的资金再建设一批工程。目前已决定建设的有一座大型高炉和许多座小型高炉，一座大型平炉，一座焦炉和许多均热炉、煤气发生炉等。其中若干个小型高炉已经施工，大高炉6月份就可以正式动工。这些工程的增建，对保证鞍钢在第二个五年计划期间实现“投资省一半、钢铁加一翻”的奋斗目标有很大作用。
    当中共八大二次会议闭幕的消息传到这个钢铁基地以后，更加鼓舞了广大职工贯彻社会主义建设总路线的信心和决心。一位负责基本建设工作的副经理说，过去由于他们对多快好省的方针体会不够全面，贯彻不够，在建设中就产生了保守和浪费；最近经过整风和进一步学习中央提出的社会主义建设总路线，他们许多人摆脱了保守思想、教条主义和经验主义的束缚，开始在工作中全面贯彻这条总路线，建设上就出现了空前跃进的局面。他们的经验证明，只有政治挂帅、走群众路线，全面地贯彻社会主义建设总路线，建设才能有飞跃的发展。
