By Every Possible Means, Develop Local Industry, Transform Consumer Cities into Production Cities
Deng Zhongru, First Secretary of the CPC Yingkou Municipal Committee, Liaoning Province

　　After Yingkou opened its port in 1858 following the "Sino-British Tianjin Treaty," it became a "colonial" trading port for imperialism to expand its commodity exports and once prospered. In the years before liberation, restaurants, brothels, money houses, and agencies filled the city, while industry was extremely weak. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it suffered severe damage from the Kuomintang, a large number of citizens lost their jobs, and the city's population decreased from the original 190,000 to 90,000, with people's lives extremely difficult. When it was liberated in 1948, the entire city was a desolate scene. In the later period of the recovery of the national economy, the city's local industry had only six very small factories. Under the correct leadership of the central government and the Liaoning Provincial Party Committee, and in accordance with the instructions of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, we actively restored and developed local industry, transforming a consumer city into a production city. Now the city's local state-owned factories have developed to more than a hundred (during the First Five-Year Plan, using only 4.26 million yuan of state investment based on the principle of diligence and frugality), the total value of production in 1957 increased by more than 38 times compared with 1949, the number of employees increased by more than 13 times; the variety of products increased from seven to one thousand and twenty-nine; and the technical level has also greatly improved. In recent years, due to the rapid development of local industry, the phenomenon of urban unemployment has been eliminated, people's lives have been greatly improved, and the rapid development of other undertakings has also been driven.

　　How has Yingkou City transformed a backward consumer city into a thriving production city in a relatively short period of time and at a faster pace in recent years?

　　Continuously Carry Out the Struggle Against Right-Leaning Conservative Thinking

　　In the process of developing local industrial production in Yingkou City in recent years, we have encountered some ideological obstacles. Although the manifestations of these ideological obstacles are different, their essence is right-leaning conservative thinking. Therefore, the process of our developing local industry is essentially a process of continuously opposing right-leaning conservative thinking and continuously boosting our energy.

　　When local industry had not yet been established, the city was desolate and there was a large unemployed population. Some cadres had pessimistic feelings about whether Yingkou could establish local industry. They believed that Yingkou was "surrounded by water on three sides and a dead port (referring to the port not being navigable at the time, and the fish being washed away by the sewage from Anshan Iron and Steel), and one side was close to the suburbs (alkaline land not growing grain) was a dead suburb, and there was a railway line, which was still the cecum (branch line) of the China Changchun Railway," and "if you want to not be desolate, you can only wait for the port to open." Their conclusion was that it was difficult for Yingkou to develop productive enterprises. Based on the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, we constantly criticized the passive thinking of simply "waiting for the port to open" and emphasized that only by developing industrial production can we fundamentally change this situation; this is not only necessary for the entire socialist construction, but also necessary for the vital interests of the people of the city. Therefore, we began to create the first batch of local industries from scratch. During this period, thirteen local industrial enterprises were established, with 6,677 employees, 383 products, and an annual output value of 21.09 million yuan.

　　After the understanding that Yingkou City must develop industry was unified, another problem arose, which was how to develop it. At that time, some cadres did not base their thinking on the specific situation of Yingkou, a coastal city, on how to mobilize the city's existing potential and develop local industry through self-reliance, but wanted to rely on state investment to do big things. When these comrades saw the large-scale economic construction being carried out in the province's key industrial cities, they developed complaints such as "large-scale everywhere, no scale in Yingkou." The Municipal Party Committee immediately criticized this thinking and, in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee and the specific situation of Yingkou City, emphasized "starting from the small and thinking in the long term." The development of industry must be based on small scale, and the main method is to rely on self-reliance and give full play to the city's existing potential. This enabled cadres to correct their understanding and clarify the direction, thereby laying the ideological foundation for implementing diligence and frugality in running industry and the whole people running industry.

　　In terms of construction speed, that is, in solving the fundamental policy issue of socialist construction, there was also a struggle between advanced thinking and conservative thinking. When difficulties such as insufficient raw materials and sluggish sales were encountered from 1954 to 1955, some cadres with right-leaning conservative thinking developed the idea of "closing down" and proposed the so-called "consolidation and rectification." At this time, the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao on the Ten Major Relationships and the report "On the Issue of Agricultural Cooperativization" gave us the most powerful weapon, criticized these erroneous ideas, and boosted the morale of cadres at all levels and the broad masses of workers, thus enabling the city's local industry to make a huge leap forward. The total value of industrial production in the city in 1956 increased by 91% compared with 1955. However, after the great development in 1956, because there was once a shortage of certain raw materials and a backlog of some products, some cadres attempted to negate the great achievements of 1956, accusing the huge leap forward in 1956 of "one-sided pursuit of more and faster" and "rushing forward." Based on the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, we repeatedly emphasized that "sufficient estimation must be given to all the achievements in the work of 1956, and the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses must be cherished and protected, otherwise we will make serious mistakes," and affirmed the great achievements of the development of local industry in 1956. Later, after the rectification movement in 1957, especially the great call of the Party Central Committee to strive to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, we regained our revolutionary spirit, so that the total output value in 1957 increased by 29.7% compared with the greatly developed 1956.

　　Make Do With Whatever is Available, Practice Economy, Rely on the Masses, Self-Reliance

　　In terms of factory buildings, we tried our best to use and repair old houses and rent private houses. By the end of 1957, the old houses and private houses repaired and rented in local industry accounted for 81% of the total number of production buildings. The machinery factory had no dormitories, so the workers signed a contract with the monks of the "Lengyan Temple" and lodged in the temple. When the food factory expanded production, the factory buildings and dormitories were insufficient, so the factory director squeezed in with the laboratory, and the branch office worked during the day and became the temporary dormitory for female workers at night; the nursery lived with children during the day and adults slept at night. The oiled paper factory built a factory with an annual output of 150,000 printed cardboard sheets with only a dilapidated room and three desks nailed with old wood.

　　In terms of equipment, we tried our best to use old equipment and substitute equipment, self-made simple equipment, and bought less new equipment. According to incomplete statistics from 27 factories, the idle old equipment allocated and the simple equipment made by using waste materials accounted for 41% of the total number of main equipment in these factories. Most of these old equipment were wastes that had been scrapped by state-owned factories and were planned to be treated as waste products. We only used a small amount of repair costs to completely turn these wastes into useful machines. Many factories were completely or mostly filled with these dilapidated equipment. At the beginning of the establishment of the Municipal Machinery Factory, all the sixteen lathes, three shaper machines, two drilling machines and large and small milling machines in the factory were old equipment that was allocated unused.

　　In terms of funds, during the First Five-Year Plan, in addition to the state investment of more than 4 million yuan and a part of the loan from the bank, most of it was self-reliance. Some organized the masses to raise funds by themselves and repay the principal with interest added at the bank interest rate. Some adopted the method of building factories while producing and self-reliance to overcome the difficulties of insufficient funds. When the Machinery Factory was newly built in February 1956, the government only invested 50,000 yuan, which was only enough for installing the transformer substation. Although cadres and workers worked together to repair the houses, pad the courtyard, and install the machine tools, because they could not pay wages, even the workers' meals became a problem. At that time, they put forward the slogan of "building factories while producing," and while some people were building factories, others borrowed a diesel engine, picked up some scrap iron, cast stoves, grate bars, and fire shovels and other products for sale, which solved the workers' wages and the factory's expenses and gradually built the factory.

　　In terms of labor, we adopted the methods of mutual cooperation between local state-owned factories, handicraft cooperatives, and household sideline businesses, and employing temporary workers locally to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor during the busy season of production. This can not only meet the needs of production, but also avoid idling. The candy factory needs 750 workers during the busiest time of production every year, while it only needs 440 workers on weekdays. If 750 workers are hired all year round, it will cause idling. They adopted this method to solve both problems.

　　All those that can be produced in a decentralized manner are coordinated through the organization of household sideline businesses. For example, the thread twisting factory has only 400 workers in the entire factory, but they organized more than 2,000 people through street organizations to weave fishing nets and make ropes for them through household sideline businesses. Recently, many factories have signed contracts with various middle schools to organize students to participate in factory production through work-study programs. This method has found a new way for local industry to solve the problem of insufficient labor.

　　In terms of technical strength, in recent years, we have relied closely on veteran workers and learning from other places to solve the difficulties of insufficient technical strength. For example, the roller ball factory, which plans to produce 500,000 sets of roller balls annually, originally relied on two veteran workers to successfully trial-produce the roller balls. Later, after sending people to roller ball factories in Wafangdian, Shenyang, Harbin, and other places for learning several times, the key technical problems were solved.

　　In terms of raw materials, many factories use waste materials to produce, save raw materials, and overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials. In 1957, the No. 2 Knitting Factory used the leftover scraps from tailoring fleece clothing and spring and autumn clothing to piece together children's fleece clothing and spring and autumn clothing, reaching more than 8,000 dozen. They sent the broken fleece cloth to the state-owned textile factory for processing into blended yarn, and used it to produce more than 5,000 dozen fleece clothing. The production of these two batches of products with waste materials created more than 240,000 yuan of wealth for the country.

　　The Whole Party Runs Industry, All Levels Run Industry, the Whole People Run Industry

　　Due to the implementation of the policy of the whole party running industry, all levels running industry, and the whole people running industry, diverse forms of developing local industry have been created. In addition to some important and larger factories (more than 1,000 people) directly operated by the city, in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of districts and streets in running industry and the masses in running industry more widely and fully, the policy of freely running district-level joint factories and street offices running small factories was implemented. Now, all districts have district-level joint factories. Taking the Xishi District as an example, the joint factory in this district belongs to 22 small factories, the larger ones with two to three hundred people, and the smaller ones with more than ten people. This district-run joint factory is the central factory in the district. All kinds of small factories are led by it in a unified way, hooking up all the small factories, cooperating closely, and promoting production development. At the same time, because a unified management organization is set up to be responsible for the supply and sales work of each factory, management personnel can also be saved. Street offices in the district have also organized many production units. The characteristics of this industry are small, flexible, and fast production development. Its houses, equipment, tools, and funds are all raised and prepared by the masses themselves.

　　In addition, the civil affairs department of the Municipal People's Committee has also set up production welfare societies with social relief properties. This production is run by the masses themselves, supported by the government, not afraid of dispersion, not afraid of small, and based on supply and sales, doing whatever is available, combining centralized or decentralized production flexibly. Therefore, it can neither involve the country's energy, nor can it give people with family affairs who are semi-laborers and people with disabilities who can still engage in slight labor the opportunity to participate in production.

　　The Handicraft Cooperative Union has organized various production cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives, and production teams. Among the family members of employees and street residents, a large number of various household sideline businesses that process for factories and handicraft cooperatives have also been organized. In 1957 alone, 4,600 people participated in the sideline business of pasting matchboxes for the match factory, with a total annual wage income of 368,000 yuan. In recent years, we have mobilized various departments to exert their strength from all aspects and positions to support local industry, so as to accelerate the development speed of local industry, so that some departments originally believed that local industry was "broken and rotten, and always wanted people and money," turning their negative attitude into enthusiastic concern and strong support. As a result, a new situation of "people contributing people, money contributing money, and strength contributing strength" has emerged to actively support the development of local industry.

　　In recent years, various departments in the city have tried their best to compress expenditure and squeeze out money to support and develop local industry. According to statistics, from 1953 to 1957, the investment allocated to local industry from the municipal financial budget was equivalent to 36.6% of the total state investment in Yingkou's local industry during the same period. In order to develop local industrial production, the municipal-level organs have not built a single dormitory in recent years, using the funds saved to support local industry. In recent years, the municipal real estate department has adjusted and repaired a total of 69,844 square meters of houses for local industry, and used the rental income to build 9,045 square meters of houses for local industry, effectively supporting the development of local industry.

　　Through these forms, all the forces that could be mobilized in the city were mobilized, turning this backward consumer city into a prosperous production city.

　　From Nothing to Something, From Few to Many

　　Hens lay eggs, mother factories split into sub-factories. It is more difficult to build a new factory on a flat ground, but it is easier to cultivate a new factory from an existing factory. Because they have factory buildings, equipment, funds, technical strength, and management cadres, many difficulties can be overcome in a timely manner, and it is easier to achieve from nothing to something, from small to large, and from few to many. For example, the predecessor of the Auto Parts Factory—the Municipal United Factory—split into five independent factories in just about three years. Among them, the chemical oil group, which originally had only two large pots and three workers, has now developed into a chemical oil factory with 500 people capable of producing various chemical oils and greases.

　　Large factories lead small factories. Organize state-owned factories in the city to use their idle equipment and technical strength to support and develop small factories. The advantage of this approach is that it can save equipment investment and solve technical problems. Therefore, the development and improvement of many small factories is also rapid. For example, the Minsheng Paper Mill was closed before the joint state-private operation due to outdated equipment, poor technology, and sluggish sales. Later, with the help of the state-owned paper mill, several cadres and some idle equipment, and using their waste pulp, the factory developed from 26 people to 152 people in just over a year, and the monthly output increased from 10 tons to 113.5 tons. Some local state-owned factories have also led some handicraft industries in the same category.

　　Gradual upgrading. Handcraft cooperatives or welfare production units with development prospects and production properties suitable for state operation are gradually upgraded to local state-owned factories (welfare societies are upgraded to handcraft societies, or upgraded to local state-owned factories) when they have developed to a certain scale and with the voluntary participation of the masses. From 1954 to 1956, a total of 21 units of welfare societies in the city were transferred to local state-owned and handcraft societies, with a staff of more than 2,400 people. These units developed into larger factories in a very short period of time after being upgraded.

　　Continuously cultivate and develop reserve forces. While upgrading some handcraft societies and welfare societies, we still actively expand the reserve forces and organize new handcraft societies and welfare societies. After the Municipal Handicraft Society handed over six units last year, it actively developed a batch of new industries such as paint and hemp rope. Among them, the linen drawnwork society initially had only one woman who knew this technology. Due to their active organization, they trained more than 100 skilled workers in just half a year to produce tablecloths, curtains and other export products. According to the requirements of orders, this year it will develop to 2,000 people. The advantage of this production organization form is that it can be developed when needed, and production problems can be contracted at any time without causing a burden to the country.

　　The reason why Yingkou City's local industry can develop rapidly is due to the resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party, and the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's policy of building the country with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and diligence and frugality, which pointed out a clear direction for the people of the city. Now, after the great rectification movement in 1957 in Yingkou City, especially after the Party Central Committee proposed the call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, the revolutionary spirit of the people of the city has become even higher, and the great leap forward in thinking has promoted the great leap forward in production. Under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, going all out, aiming high, and striving for the top, we can fully believe that the speed of local industrial construction in the city this year will exceed any year since liberation.

　　千方百计，兴办地方工业，变消费城市为生产城市
　　中共辽宁省营口市委第一书记　邓仲儒
    营口于1858年“中英天津条约”开港后，即成为帝国主义扩大其商品输出的一个“殖民地”商埠，曾繁荣一时。在解放以前的年代里，酒楼、妓馆、钱庄、代理店满布全市，工业极为薄弱。抗日战争胜利以后，又遭到国民党的严重破坏，大批市民失业，城市人口由原来的十九万减少到九万，人民生活极端困苦。1948年解放的时候，整个城市是一片萧条景象。到国民经济恢复后期，全市地方工业仅有六个很小的工厂。在中央和辽宁省委的正确领导下，根据党的七届二中全会的指示，我们积极的恢复和发展了地方工业，把一个消费城市改造成为生产城市。现在全市地方国营工厂已发展到百余个（在第一个五年计划期间依据勤俭办企业的原则只用了国家投资四百二十六万元），1957年的生产总值比1949年增加了三十八倍多，职工人数增加了十三倍以上；产品品种由七种增加到一千零二十九种；技术水平也有很大提高。几年来，由于地方工业的迅速发展，城市失业现象已经消灭，人民生活有了很大的改善，也带动了其他各种事业的迅速发展。
    几年来营口市是怎样以较短的时间和较快的速度把一个落后的消费的城市，改造成为一个欣欣向荣的生产的城市呢？
    不断开展反右倾保守思想的斗争
    营口市几年来在发展地方工业生产的过程中，曾遇到了一些思想障碍。这些思想障碍的表现形式虽然不同，但实质上都是右倾保守思想。因此，我们发展地方工业的过程，实质上就是不断地反对右倾保守思想和不断地鼓足干劲的斗争过程。
    当地方工业还没有建立起来的时候，城市是一片萧条，失业人口很多。有些干部对营口能否建立起地方工业有着悲观情绪。他们认为营口“三面环水是死港（指当时港口不通航，鱼又被鞍钢污水冲跑了），一面靠郊（区）是死郊（碱地不打粮），有条火车道，还是中长路的盲肠（支线）”，“要想不萧条，只有等开港”。他们的结论是营口难以发展起生产事业。我们依据党的七届二中全会的指示精神，不断地批判了单纯“等开港”的“环境论”的消极思想，强调只有发展工业生产，才能从根本上改变这个现状；这不仅为整个社会主义建设所必需，而且也是为全市人民切身利益所必需。于是我们开始从无到有地创办了第一批地方工业。这个时期建立的地方工业有十三个，职工有六千六百七十七人，产品有三百八十三种，年产值达二千一百零九万元。
    在营口市必须发展工业这个问题统一了认识以后，又出现了另外一个问题，这就是怎样发展的问题。当时有些干部不是根据营口这个沿海城市的具体情况，如何调动起这个城市旧有的潜力，自力更生地发展地方工业，而想靠国家投资搞大的。这些同志，当看到本省各重点工业城市进行大规模经济建设的时候，就产生“到处大规模，营口无规模”等埋怨情绪。市委立即批判了这种思想，根据中央、省委的指示精神和营口市的具体情况，强调从“小处着手，远处着想”，发展工业必须以小型为主，办法主要是靠自力更生，充分发挥这个城市旧有的潜力。这就使干部端正了认识，明确了方向，从而给贯彻勤俭办工业，全民办工业打下了思想基础。
    在建设速度上，也就是在解决社会主义建设这个带有根本性的方针问题上，也经过了先进思想和保守思想的斗争。1954年到1955年遇到原料不足、销路不畅的困难的时候，一部分有右倾保守思想的干部就产生了“收摊子”的思想，提出所谓“巩固整顿”的主张。此时，党中央和毛主席关于十大关系的指示和“关于农业合作化问题”的报告给了我们最有力的武器，批判了这些错误思想，鼓舞了各级干部和全市广大职工的干劲，因而使全市地方工业有了一个巨大的跃进。全市1956年工业生产总值较1955年增长了91％。但是经过1956年大发展以后，因为曾一度发生某些原材料紧张和部分产品积压的现象，又有些干部企图否定1956年的伟大成就，指责1956年的巨大跃进是“片面追求多快”，“冒进了”。我们根据省委指示，反复强调“对于1956年工作中的一切成就必须给以足够的估计，对于干部和群众的热情必须加以珍惜和保护，否则我们将会犯严重错误”，肯定了1956年地方工业发展的巨大成绩。后经过1957年整风运动，特别是党中央提出争取在十五年赶上英国的伟大号召，使我们重新鼓起了革命干劲，使1957年的总产值比大发展的1956年又增长了29.7％。
    因陋就简，精打细算，依靠群众，自力更生
    在厂房方面，我们尽量利用和修补旧房，租用民房。到1957年止，在地方工业中修补和租用的旧房和民房，占整个生产用房总数的81％。机械厂没有宿舍，工人就和“楞严寺”的和尚订了合同，寄住寺内。食品厂扩大生产时，厂房和宿舍不足，厂长就和化验室挤在一起，支部办公室白天办公，晚上便是女工的临时宿舍；托儿所白天住小孩，晚上就睡大人。油纸厂只用一间破烂房，用旧木料钉了三张桌案子就建起了一个年产十五万张印花纸板的工厂。
    在设备方面，我们尽量利用旧设备和代用设备，自制简易设备，少买新设备。根据二十七个厂的不完全统计，几年来调拨来的闲置旧设备和利用废料自制的简易设备，占这些工厂主要设备总数的41％。这些旧设备大多数都是各国营工厂已经报废的拟作废品处理的废物。我们只用很少的修理费，就把这些废物完全变成了有用的机器。有不少厂子全部或绝大部分都是依靠这些破旧设备充实起来的。市机械厂建厂之初，全厂的十六台车床、三台牛头刨、两台钻床和大小铣床，就都是调拨不用的旧设备。
    在资金方面，我们在第一个五年计划期间，除了由国家投资四百多万元和向银行贷了一部分款外，多半是自力更生。有的是组织群众自筹资金，按银行利率加息还本。有的采取边建厂边生产、自力更生的办法，克服资金不足的困难。1956年2月新建机械厂时，政府仅投资五万元，这些钱只够安装变电所用，虽然干部和工人一齐下手修房子、垫院子、安机床，但是因为发不了工资，工人连吃饭都成了问题。当时他们就提出：“边生产，边建厂”的口号，在一部分人建厂的同时，另一部分人借个柴油机，拣些废铁，铸造火炉子、炉条和打火铲子等产品出卖，这样就解决了工人的工资和工厂的经费开支问题，使工厂逐步建设起来。
    在劳动力方面，我们采取了地方国营工厂、手工业合作社和家庭副业互相配合协作及就地采用临时工等办法，解决生产忙季劳动力不足的困难。这样既能满足生产需要，又不会造成窝工现象。糖果厂每年生产最忙时，需要七百五十名工人，而平日只需要四百四十名工人，如果常年录用七百五十名工人就会造成窝工，他们采取了这种办法，就使这两方面的问题都得到了解决。
    凡可以不集中生产的，即通过组织家庭副业相互协作。如捻线厂，全厂工人仅有四百名，但他们通过街道组织家庭副业组织了二千余人给他们织鱼网、打绳子。最近又有不少工厂和各中学签订了合同，通过勤工俭学的办法，组织学生参加工厂的生产。这种办法使地方工业在解决劳动力不足的问题上找到了一个新的途径。
    在技术力量方面，几年来我们紧紧依靠老工人和到外地去学习的办法，解决技术力量不足的困难。例如计划年产五十万套滚珠的滚珠厂，原来就是依靠两名老工人试制成功了滚珠，后来又经过几次派人到瓦房店、沈阳、哈尔滨等地滚珠厂去学习，使技术上的关键问题都获得解决。
    在原材料方面，不少工厂利用废料生产，节约原材料和克服原材料不足的困难。针织二厂1957年利用剪裁绒衣和春秋衣剩余的边角，拼凑成小孩绒衣和春秋衣达八千余打。他们把破碎绒布送到国营纺织厂加工成为混纺纱，用它生产出五千余打绒衣。用废料生产这两批产品，就给国家创造了二十四万多元的财富。
　　全党办工业，各级办工业，全民办工业
    由于贯彻了全党办工业、各级办工业、全民办工业的方针，创造了多种多样的发展地方工业的形式。除一些重要的和较大的工厂（千人以上的）由市直接经营外，为了把区、街办工业和群众办工业的积极性更广泛更充分地调动起来，实行了放手举办区级联合工厂和街道办事处办小型工厂的方针。现在，各区都有区级联合工厂。以西市区为例，这个区的联合工厂属有二十二个小型工厂，大者二、三百人，小者十余人。这种区办的联合工厂，就是区里的中心工厂，各种各类的小工厂，由它统一领导，把所有的小工厂都挂上钩，互相配合，密切协作，促进生产发展。同时，因为设立了统一的管理机构，负责各厂的供销工作，还可以节省管理人员。区属街道办事处也组织起不少的生产单位。这种工业的特点是小、灵活、生产发展得快。它的房子、设备、工具、资金，都由群众自筹自备。
    此外，市人委民政部门还举办了带社会救济性质的生产福利社。这种生产是群众自办，政府扶持，不怕分散，不怕小，根据供销情况，有啥干啥，集中或分散生产灵活结合。因此它既不能牵涉国家精力，又能使有家务牵涉的半劳动力，身体残废尚能从事轻微劳动的人得到参加生产的机会。
    手工业联社组织了各种生产社，供销社，生产小组。在职工家属和街道居民中，还组织了大批为工厂为手工业社加工的各种各样的家庭副业。1957年仅参加火柴厂糊火柴盒一项副业的即达四千六百人，全年工资收入达三十六万八千元。几年来我们动员了各个部门，从各个方面，各个岗位上发挥力量支援地方工业，以加快地方工业发展速度，使原来有些部门认为地方工业“破破烂烂，不是要人就是要钱”的消极态度，转变为热情关怀，大力支持。结果出现了“有人出人，有钱出钱，有力出力”积极支援地方工业发展的新局面。
    几年来，全市各个部门都尽量压缩经费开支，挤出钱来支援与发展地方工业。据统计，从1953年到1957年，从市财政预算中拨给地方工业的投资相当于同期国家给营口市地方工业总投资的36.6％。为了发展地方工业生产，市级机关几年来没建过一间宿舍，用节约下来的资金支援地方工业。几年来，市房产部门共给地方工业调整和修补了六万九千八百四十四平方公尺房屋，并以房租收入为地方工业新建了九千零四十五平方公尺用房，有力地支援了地方工业的发展。
    通过这些形式，把全市各方面可能动员的力量都动员起来了，使这个落后的消费的城市变成了繁荣的生产城市。
    从无到有，从少到多
    母鸡下蛋，母厂劈子厂。平地建立一个新工厂，困难是比较多的，但从一个原有的工厂中培植起一个新工厂就比较容易。因为他们有厂房、设备、资金、技术力量和管理干部，许多困难能够得到及时的克服，比较容易做到从无到有，从小到大和由少到多。如汽车部件厂的前身——市联合厂仅仅经过三年左右的时间，就分劈出来五个独立的工厂。其中原来只有两口大锅、三个工人的化学油小组，现在发展为有五百人能生产各种化学油脂的化学制油厂。
    大厂带小厂。组织市内国营工厂，利用他们闲置设备和技术力量来扶持和发展小厂。这种做法的优点是：可以节约设备投资，解决技术问题。因此许多小工厂发展和提高也迅速。如民生造纸厂在公私合营前曾因设备陈旧，技术低劣，销路不畅而关闭，后由国营造纸厂帮助几名干部及部分闲置设备，并利用他们的废浆，仅经过一年多的时间，这个厂就由二十六人发展到一百五十二人，月产量由十吨提高到一百一十三点五吨。有些地方国营工厂也带起了一些同类行业的手工业。
    逐步升级。把有发展前途，生产性质又适合于国家经营的手工业合作社或福利生产单位，在发展到一定规模并在群众自愿的情况下，逐渐地把他们升级为地方国营工厂（福利社升为手工业社，或升为地方国营工厂）。全市福利社从1954年到1956年先后移交给地方国营和手工业社的有二十一个单位，人员达二千四百余人。这些单位在升级以后很短的时间里，就发展成为较大的工厂。
    不断培养和发展后备力量。在一部分手工业社和福利社升级的同时，仍积极扩展后备力量，组织新的手工业社和福利社。市手工业社在去年交出六个单位以后，又积极地发展了一批油漆、麻绳等新的行业。其中麻布抽绣社，开始只有一个懂得这种技术的妇女，由于他们积极的组织，仅半年的时间即培养出一百多名生产台布、窗帘等出口产品的熟练工人，根据订货的要求，今年将发展到二千人。这种生产组织形式的好处是：需要时可以发展，生产有了问题还可以随时收缩，不致给国家造成负担。
    营口市的地方工业所以能够迅速的发展，是由于党的七届二中全会的决议，党中央、毛主席多快好省、勤俭建国的方针，给全市人民指出了明确的方向所获得的。现在营口市经过了1957年的伟大整风运动，特别是党中央提出十五年赶上英国的号召后，全市人民的革命干劲更加高涨起来，思想大跃进推动了生产大跃进。全市人民在多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游的建设总路线照耀下，目前发展地方工业的高潮已经形成，全民办工业，市、区、街道分工合作办工业已在全市开花，1至4月份的地方工业的总产值，比去年同时期又增长了58％。广大职工群众敢想敢干，新产品新纪录层出不穷，技术革新的事迹已遍及各厂。在社会主义建设的总路线的照耀下，我们完全可以相信，今年全市地方工业建设的速度一定会超过解放以来的任何一年。
