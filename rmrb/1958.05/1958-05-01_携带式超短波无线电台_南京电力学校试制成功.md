    Portable Ultra-Shortwave Radio Station Successfully Trial-Produced by Nanjing Electric Power School

    (Our newspaper dispatch) Nanjing Electric Power School has successfully trial-produced a portable ultra-shortwave radio station.

    The portable ultra-shortwave radio station, from design and material sourcing to successful trial production, took only five days and nights. The successful trial production of the product can greatly reduce the state's investment in basic construction for the power system's communications. After mass production of the new product, the power school will be transformed into a new type of socialist school that combines learning and labor. (Huang Hongyuan)
