    Two Projectionists
    When you watch a movie, sometimes you see the film suddenly break, and dancing lines appear on the screen. After a few seconds, the film resumes normal projection. This is the phenomenon of reel change. Recently, two projectionists from Shanghai cinemas, Yao Liang and Huang Fusheng, created a "film projector automation device." Tense labor is replaced by machinery, and the accuracy of reel changes reaches a few hundredths of a second. Originally, two projectors required two people to manage, but now only one person is needed. Moreover, it saves a large amount of electricity and carbon rods. Calculated based on fifty projection units in Shanghai, it can save more than 30,000 yuan per year. The cost of the projector automation device is only 160 yuan.

    两个放映员
    当你看电影的时候，有时会看到影片突然断了，银幕上出现跳动的线条，过几秒钟之后，影片才恢复正常的放映。这是换片的现象。最近上海两家电影院的放映员姚亮、黄福生创造了一种“电影放映机自动化设备”，紧张的劳动被机械所代替，换片的准确度达到几百分之一秒，原来两部放映机需两个人管理，现在只要一个人，而且节省大量电力和炭精，按上海五十个放映单位计算，一年可节省三万多元。放映机自动化设备的成本却只有一百六十元。
