Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 15th. Construction officially began on the longest permanent bridge in China – the Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge on the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway – on the 14th. It will replace the existing Yellow River Railway Bridge and become an important hub for the exchange of materials between northern and southern China.

This double-track bridge is 2,889.80 meters long with a total of 71 spans. After the bridge is completed, all types of locomotives will be able to run on it. Once the Yellow River is properly managed, ships will be able to navigate freely under the bridge.

According to the national plan, the bridge will be completed and open to traffic in 1960. However, seeing the current great leap forward in industry and agriculture in our country, and the situation where the Beijing-Guangzhou and Longhai Railways will soon be double-tracked, making the existing single-track Yellow River Railway Bridge unable to bear the heavy transportation tasks, the bridge builders are actively taking measures to strive to complete the bridge construction ahead of schedule.

After the new Zhengzhou Yellow River Bridge is completed, the original Yellow River Railway Bridge, with a foundation depth of only sixteen meters, will have its task entirely taken over by the new bridge when the Sanmenxia Reservoir stores water, the Yellow River becomes clear, and scouring intensifies, reaching a depth of twenty-seven meters.

The most difficult part of building such a large bridge on the Yellow River is the bridge pier foundation engineering. In order to build this bridge on the geologically unfavorable Yellow River, making it as solid as a rock, the builders creatively used the large-scale caisson drilling method adopted in the construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge. Here, they increased the diameter of the caissons to 3.6 meters, using only two caissons as the foundation for each pier, and using a vibratory pile driver to drive the caissons to a depth of 40 meters into the soil; it is the first time in the history of bridge construction in our country that such large caissons have been sunk with a vibratory pile driver. After more than two months of testing, it has been proven that this bridge construction method is completely feasible on the Yellow River. Currently, the caissons for seven piers have begun to sink. Due to the use of parallel operations in construction, the speed of the foundation engineering will be greatly accelerated.

### 郑州黄河大桥动工兴建

　　郑州黄河大桥动工兴建
    新华社郑州15日电　我国最长的一座永久性桥梁——京广铁路上的郑州黄河大桥，14日正式动工兴建。它将代替现有的黄河铁桥而成为我国北方和南方物资交流的重要枢纽。
    这座复线桥全长二八八九点八零公尺，共七十一孔。大桥建成以后，不管什么机车都能行驶。桥下在黄河治理好后，可以通航无阻。
    按照国家计划，这座桥将在1960年建成通车。可是大桥建设者们看到我国当前工农业大跃进和京广、陇海两大铁路不久就要铺成复线，现有单线黄河铁桥负担不了繁重的运输任务的形势，正在积极采取措施，争取提前完成建桥任务。
    新的郑州黄河大桥建成以后，原有的黄河铁桥由于基础深度只有十六公尺，在三门峡水库蓄水，黄河水变清，冲刷加剧，深度达到二十七公尺的时候，它的任务就要全部交给新桥来承担。
    在黄河上建筑这样的大桥，最困难的部分是桥墩基础工程。建设者们为了在地质不良的黄河上建成这座桥梁，使它固若磐石，创造性地运用了建设武汉长江大桥所采取的大型管柱钻孔法。在这里，他们把管柱直径加大到三点六公尺，每个桥墩只用两根管柱做基础，并且用震动打桩机使管柱的入土深度达到四十公尺；用震动打桩机下沉这样大的管柱，在我国建桥史上还是第一次。经过两个多月来的试验证明：在黄河上采用这种建桥方法完全可行。现在，大桥已经有七个桥墩的管柱开始下沉。由于在施工中采用平行作业的方法，基础工程的速度将大大加快。
