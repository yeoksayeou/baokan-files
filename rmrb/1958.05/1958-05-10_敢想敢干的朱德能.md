    Zhu Deneng, Who Dares to Think and Act
    Zhu Deneng, a labor model of Zhejiang Province and inspector at the Ningbo Power Machine Factory, is a worker who bravely innovates and dares to fight against backward thinking.
    In February of this year, Zhu Deneng, with revolutionary spirit, put forward a bold proposal: within two months, the production quality of the main parts of the power machine should catch up with the advanced Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory in the same industry. This proposal left the factory's original plan to catch up with "Shanghai Diesel" in two years far behind.
    He made this proposal based on sufficient evidence and had conducted multiple comparative studies beforehand. He felt that the reason the factory proposed to catch up with Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory in two years was due to a lack of investigation and research, failing to know oneself and the enemy; therefore, although the slogan was put forward, there were no practical and reliable measures on how to catch up. He thought that it would be difficult to catch up even in two years this way. Fearing that his consideration was subjective, he discussed it with experienced masters, such as He Quande and Chen Junchan, who were enthusiastic about technological innovation. They also felt that Zhu Deneng's words made sense and unanimously supported him. So Zhu Deneng's confidence grew even more, and he wrote a detailed proposal and sent it to the Ningbo Municipal Party Committee's newspaper. After the proposal was published on the front page of the newspaper, the factory's Party Committee leaders held an expanded Party Committee meeting overnight, deciding to abandon the conservative plan of catching up with Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory in two years and immediately take measures to organize a group of production workers to study at Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory. The broad masses of workers also very much agreed with Zhu Deneng's proposal, generally expressing that as long as the leaders were determined, they had the confidence to catch up with Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory within two months.
    As a result, a technological innovation upsurge, centered on learning advanced experience, improving technology, improving tools, and improving design, was quickly launched throughout the factory. The workers who went to Shanghai and Wuxi to study brought back a total of seventy-three advanced experiences, of which more than sixty have been tested and promoted. In March, the staff and workers put forward a total of one hundred and thirty-five rationalization proposals, and dozens of new advanced experiences emerged. Many workers gave up their days off and worked hard in the workshops to improve tools. New records and new creations emerged one after another. After one month and twenty-five days of hard work, the processing hours for the five main parts had all caught up with Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory on April 27. Zhu Deneng's bold suggestion was realized.
    Zhu Deneng was originally a lathe operator in the metalworking workshop of this factory. In 1954, he was praised as a "cover model" for creating a lathe guard. In 1956, Zhu Deneng was transferred from the metalworking workshop to the inspection department. According to routine, inspectors would inspect according to the drawings, and those that did not conform to the drawings would be scrapped. Zhu Deneng felt that this was not entirely correct. If there was an error in the drawings, should they still be inspected according to the incorrect drawings? Once, he inspected a batch of coupling washers. According to the drawings, this batch of goods should be scrapped, but after looking at them, there was nothing wrong. He took them to the assembly workshop to try them out, and they were completely usable. He consulted experienced masters who also said they were genuine products. Therefore, Zhu Deneng did not agree to scrap them. But the head of the inspection department said: "It is your responsibility to inspect according to the drawings. Errors in the drawings are the responsibility of the design department." Zhu Deneng replied well: "No matter which department's responsibility it is, the loss is always the state's." Later, the matter was clarified, and it was indeed the case that the drawings did not match the actual product. However, because Zhu Deneng was responsible in his work, the phenomenon of good products being scrapped was corrected in advance.
    The phenomenon of a large number of precision screws being reworked at the Ningbo Power Machine Factory had existed for four or five years. At least 100,000 screws were reworked every year. Zhu Deneng felt very distressed when he saw this phenomenon. He had been making suggestions for improvement for one or two years, but the factory always believed that there were limitations in equipment and technical conditions, and it could not be changed for a while. Last October, the factory launched a rectification movement. Zhu Deneng thought to himself that the screw problem must be solved by taking advantage of this "wind." So he mustered up the courage to make another suggestion, recommending that they go to Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory to learn. His section chief shook his head as soon as he heard it, saying, "Since this problem could not be solved for four or five years, there's no use being anxious now." The section chief did not agree with his opinion. After work, Zhu Deneng went home depressed. His wife said to him: "You're really silly. If the section chief doesn't understand, won't you talk to the Party Committee Secretary?"
    The next day, he went to the Party Committee Secretary. The Party Committee Secretary Yang Zaihao was also very troubled by the large waste of screws. After hearing that what he said made sense, he actively supported him to go. As soon as Zhu Deneng arrived at Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory, he saw that the precision screws of others were all good. The principle was not complicated, mainly because there was a reasonable error figure. So this system was learned. Sure enough, it took effect immediately in a few days. Because there was a reasonable error, the workers no longer had the idea of being too big or too small, they were able to work freely, and the phenomenon of a large number of reworks was eliminated.

### 敢想敢干的朱德能

    敢想敢干的朱德能
    浙江省劳动模范、宁波动力机厂检验员朱德能，是一个勇于革新、敢与落后思想作斗争的工人。
    今年2月间，朱德能以革命精神提出大胆倡议：两个月内，动力机主要零件的产质量要赶上同行业先进的上海柴油机厂。这个倡议把该厂领导原来拟定的二年赶上“上柴”的规划远远地抛在后面。
    他提这个倡议是有充分根据的，事先作过多次对比研究。他感到厂里所以提出二年赶上上海柴油机厂，原因在于缺乏调查研究，没有做到知己知彼；所以口号提了，如何赶法，切实可靠的措施却没有。他想，这样即使二年也难赶上。他唯恐自己这样考虑主观，又和平时热心革新技术的贺全德、陈俊禅等老师傅商量。他们也觉得朱德能讲得很有道理，一致支持。于是朱德能的信心更大了，写了一份详详细细的倡议书，送到中共宁波市委机关报。倡议书在报上以首版头条的地位登出来后，厂里党委领导连夜召开党委扩大会，决定抛弃二年赶上上海柴油机厂的保守规划，立即采取措施，组织一批生产工人到上海柴油机厂去学习。广大工人群众也非常赞同朱德能的倡议，普遍表示只要领导肯下决心，他们有信心两个月内赶上上海柴油机厂。
    于是全厂范围内很快地掀起了以学习先进经验、改进工艺、改进工具、改进设计为中心的技术革新高潮。到上海、无锡去学习的工人，一共带回来七十三条先进经验，至今已试验、推广六十多条。职工群众在3月份内，共提了一百三十五件合理化建议，出现了几十条新的先进经验，不少工人放弃了休息天，在车间里大改工具。新纪录、新创造层出不穷。经过一个月零二十五天的奋战，五个主件的加工工时已在4月27日那天全部赶上了上海柴油机厂。朱德能的大胆建议实现了。
    朱德能原是这个厂金工车间的车工，1954年曾经因为创造了车床防护罩而被誉为“罩壳模范”。1956年朱德能从金工车间调到检验科。按常规，检验员就是按照图纸检验，不符图纸的都报废。朱德能觉得这不完全对，如果是图纸有错，也将错就错的检验吗？一次，他检验一批联轴节垫圈，照图纸，这批东西要报废，但是看看没啥毛病，他拿到装配车间一试，完全可用，征求老师傅意见也说是正品。因此朱德能不同意报废。但是检验科长说：根据图纸检验是你的责任，图纸有错误，是设计部门责任。朱德能回答得好：“不管哪个部门的责任，损失总是国家的。”以后，事情查清楚了，果然是图纸不符实际，但是由于朱德能工作负责，好货作废的现象事先纠正了。
    宁波动力机厂里精密螺丝大量返工的现象已经存在整整四、五年了，每年至少有十万只螺丝返工，朱德能看到这种现象感到十分痛心，要求改进的意见提了也有一、二年了，但是厂里总是认为设备条件、技术条件有限制，一时改不过来。去年10月厂里开展整风运动，朱德能暗想，螺丝问题一定要乘这“风”解决掉，于是他鼓起勇气再提意见，建议到上海柴油机厂去学习。他的科长一听就摇头，说：“这问题既然四、五年解决不了，现在急也没用。”科长不同意他的意见。下班后，朱德能闷闷不乐地回家。他的爱人对他说：“你真傻，科长不通，不会和党委书记说吗？”
    第二天，他去找党委书记。党委书记杨在浩也正为螺丝浪费大伤脑筋，听他讲得有道理便积极支持他去。一到上海柴油机厂，朱德能看到人家的精密螺丝只只好，道理并不复杂，主要是有一个合理的误差数字。于是这一项制度就给学来了。果然没几天，便立即见效，因为有合理误差，工人偏大偏小的思想没有了，工作放手了，大量返工现象也消灭了。　（据浙江日报）
