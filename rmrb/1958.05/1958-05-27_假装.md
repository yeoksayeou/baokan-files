    Pretending
    At an election rally in Italy, a Social Democratic candidate was giving a passionate speech about socialism and democracy. At this point, a listener stood up and asked, "Why do you cooperate with the Fascist Party in the city council?" The candidate pretended not to hear and continued with his nonsense. When he shouted, "Oppose the Church!" another listener loudly asked him, "Then why do you support the government of the Church?" The candidate again pretended not to hear and continued his speech....
    Pretending not to hear has become this bourgeois politician's shield. This Italian Social Democrat must have a very thick skin to avoid answering the audience's questions. Of course, pretending not to hear while continuing to peddle fake medicine will inevitably lead to further exposure by the audience, eventually resulting in complete bankruptcy.

    假装
    在意大利一个竞选集会上，一个社会民主党候选人正在慷慨激昂地大谈社会主义和民主。这时一个听众起来问：“你为什么在市议会中跟法西斯党合作呢？”这位候选人假装没听见，继续胡诌下去。当他高叫“反对教会”时，另一个听众又高声问他：“那你为什么要支持教会的政府呢？”这位候选人又假装没听见，继续他的演讲……。
    假装没听见，竟成了这个资产阶级政客的挡箭牌了。这个意大利社会民主党人，亏得有这样厚的脸皮才能不回答听众的问题。当然，假装没听见而继续贩卖假药，就不能不遭到听众的继续揭穿，最后完全破产。
