　　A New Issue
　　On the Egg Purchasing Work in Anyang County
    The news about Anyang County, Henan Province purchasing eggs, published in today's newspaper, raises an important new issue that deserves everyone's attention. Its significance lies in the fact that under the leadership of the Party committee, the commercial departments of Anyang have thoroughly overcome the major weaknesses that have long existed in commercial departments, namely, neglecting politics, lacking a strong production perspective, and failing to effectively follow the mass line. The experience of Anyang has universal practical significance for commercial work nationwide, especially in rural areas.
    Now is the peak season for egg production, but the retail prices of eggs in many cities are higher than in the same period in previous years, and the quantity supplied is also less than in previous years. Many egg processing factories cannot fully utilize their production potential due to insufficient raw materials. This situation is mainly caused by the poor egg purchasing situation in various regions this year. Since it is the peak season, why can't eggs be purchased?
    In previous years, every egg season many peddlers were engaged in trafficking, and farmers themselves could sell eggs to market towns at any time. State-owned commercial enterprises and supply and marketing cooperatives could concentrate the eggs scattered among thousands of households by purchasing them at designated locations. This year, due to the great leap forward in agricultural production, there is a shortage of labor in rural areas, and there is a production upsurge in which men, women, old and young are mobilized, turning night into day and rainy days into sunny days. Seasonal peddlers no longer exist, and farmers have very little time to sell agricultural and sideline products and purchase daily industrial goods. Therefore, the original establishment of commercial outlets and old purchasing and marketing methods are completely incompatible with this new situation. As a result, the number of eggs purchased nationwide has decreased significantly compared to the same period last year, with some provinces decreasing by 30% and others by 50%. How should this new problem be solved? The experience of Anyang County answers this question. The egg purchasing situation in the first quarter of this year in the county was also very poor. Egg production increased by one-third compared with the same period last year, but the number of purchases decreased by a quarter compared with the same period last year. Under the leadership of the CPC County Committee, the local commercial departments conscientiously overcame the right-leaning conservative thinking in commercial work, mobilized and relied on the broad masses, adjusted the original commercial network according to the needs of the current development of the rural situation, improved the purchasing methods, and implemented day and night purchasing and marketing. After these measures were taken, the purchasing situation immediately improved significantly, not only satisfying the farmers' demands for sale, but also improved the operating style of the commercial departments, enhanced ideological understanding, and strengthened the political, production, and mass viewpoints of commercial cadres.
    Commercial work is the link between production and consumption. Serving production and serving consumption are the basic tasks of commercial work. Marx once said: "The depth, breadth and mode of exchange are all determined by the development and structure of production, for example, exchange between town and country, exchange within the village, exchange within the city, and so on. From this, it can be seen that exchange in all its elements is either directly contained in production or is determined by production." (See "Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy") Therefore, commercial work must adapt to the requirements of production development, adapt to the requirements of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and adapt to the general requirements of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The current focus of rural work is to strive to achieve a comprehensive leap forward in agricultural production, and the use and deployment of rural labor must obey this requirement. If commercial work can develop accordingly with this change, it can promote urban-rural exchanges and promote production development; if it cannot change accordingly to adapt to the needs of the development of the objective situation, it will inevitably affect the smooth flow of urban-rural exchanges and hinder the development of production.
    At present, comrades engaged in commercial work have two different understandings and attitudes toward this new situation. Some comrades believe that the new situation currently emerging in rural areas is in line with the laws of economic development, and that rural commercial work must adopt new working methods and new measures to suit this new situation. Therefore, they must closely rely on the leadership of the Party committee and the broad masses, and try every possible means to solve existing problems and find working methods and measures that can adapt to the new situation. Anyang County is doing just that, and has therefore achieved results. Some comrades, however, take another attitude. They do not see the changes in this new situation. The objective situation has moved forward, but their understanding remains at the old stage. They emphasize objective difficulties, and even complain and blame, and their working methods remain old-fashioned. Despite the leap forward targets, there are no leap forward measures and drive, so that the poor purchasing situation cannot be reversed for a long time. The former understanding sees the mainstream, grasps the essence, and holds a pro-promotion attitude, and the work is vigorous. The latter understanding only sees the tributaries, grasps the phenomena, and holds a pro-regression attitude, and the work is lifeless. The change of objective things is never-ending, it is always developing and changing forward according to its own laws. People's ideological understanding must advance with the changed objective situation in order to do a good job. The experience of Anyang County vividly proves this point.
    The mass line is the basic line of our Party and state work. All work must be done well by mobilizing and relying on the masses, and commercial work is no exception. The successful experience of Anyang County in this regard has set a banner for how commercial work should follow the mass line and rely on the masses to run commerce. They have implemented the principles of relying on the masses and facilitating the masses in publicity methods, purchasing and marketing methods, the grades and specifications of procurement, and the arrangement of business hours, and are therefore welcomed by the broad masses. Anyang County, in conjunction with work-study programs, advocated students sending eggs and teachers collecting them on behalf, and at the same time decided to change the method of purchasing by the catty to purchasing by the piece. This change solved the problem of lack of scales and the difficulty for primary school students to calculate accounts by weight. This may seem like an unimportant small problem, but in essence it is a major issue related to whether or not to follow the mass line.
    According to the new situation in rural areas, Anyang County mobilized agricultural cooperatives to generally establish supply and marketing departments, relying on the masses to run commerce, purchasing what agricultural cooperatives and members need to sell, and supplying the daily necessities that agricultural cooperatives and members need to buy. There are many benefits to doing so. First, it facilitates the masses and saves labor, which is of great help to supporting agricultural production. Secondly, the cooperative cadres and members are very concerned about the operation of the supply and marketing departments, and the connection between the supply and marketing departments and the masses is closer. At the same time, the business staff of the supply and marketing departments are given work points by the agricultural cooperatives according to their labor, and the agricultural cooperatives can also allocate personnel according to the busy and slack seasons of the business. The agricultural cooperatives also facilitate the unified arrangement of labor to transport agricultural and sideline products sold to the state in a timely manner. After the establishment of supply and marketing departments by agricultural cooperatives, not only can the shortage of state-owned commercial management forces be supplemented, but also the commercial, agricultural, and financial work can be more closely integrated through the purchasing and marketing activities of the supply and marketing departments. Therefore, mobilizing agricultural cooperatives to establish supply and marketing departments, relying on the masses to run commerce, and engaging in rural purchasing and marketing activities under the leadership of state-owned commerce are beneficial to the state, agricultural cooperatives, and members of the masses.
    The experience of Anyang County is not only a matter of solving the method of purchasing eggs, but more importantly, it further specifically proves that commercial work must have a clear political viewpoint, production viewpoint, and mass viewpoint; only by overcoming the right-leaning conservative thinking that is divorced from reality, recognizing the current new situation, closely relying on the leadership of the Party committee, relying on the masses to run commerce, and adopting new working methods and measures, can commercial work make a great leap forward.

### 一个新问题  评安阳县的鸡蛋收购工作

　　一个新问题
　　评安阳县的鸡蛋收购工作
    今天本报发表的河南安阳县收购鸡蛋的消息，提出了一个重要的新问题，很值得大家一看。它的重要意义在于：安阳商业部门在党委领导下，彻底克服了商业部门长期存在的不问政治、生产观点不强和没有很好地走群众路线这一重大弱点。安阳的经验对全国的商业工作特别是农村商业工作，有普遍的实际意义。
    现在正是鸡蛋生产的旺季，但很多城市鸡蛋的销售价格比前几年同时期都高，供应的数量也比往年减少。许多蛋品加工厂由于原料不足也不能充分发挥生产潜力。这种情况主要是由于今年各地的鸡蛋收购情况不好而引起的。既然是旺季，为什么鸡蛋又收购不起来呢？
    往年，每到鸡蛋旺季，都有许多小贩从事贩运，农民自己也随时把鸡蛋送到集镇出售，国营商业和供销社只要在一定地点进行收购，就可以把分散在千家万户的鸡蛋收购集中起来。今年由于农业生产的大跃进，农村中的劳动力感到不足，出现了男女老少齐出动、把黑夜当白天、把雨天当晴天的生产高潮。季节性的小商小贩没有了，农民自己很少时间来出售农副产品和购买日用工业品。这样，原有商业网点的设置和老的购销方法同这种新的情况就完全不能相适应了。因此，全国收购鸡蛋的数量比去年同期下降很多，有的省下降30％，有的省下降50％。应该怎样去解决这个新问题？安阳县的经验回答了这个问题。这个县今年第一季度的鸡蛋收购情况也很不好。鸡蛋产量比去年同期增加三分之一，但收购数量却比去年同期下降四分之一。当地商业部门在中共县委的领导下，认真克服了商业工作中的右倾保守思想，发动和依靠广大群众，根据当前农村形势发展的需要，调整了原有的商业网，改进了收购方法，实行日夜购销等等。采取这些措施以后，收购情况立即显著好转，不仅满足了农民出售的要求，同时也改进了商业部门的经营作风，提高了思想认识，加强了商业干部的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点。
    商业工作是生产和消费之间的纽带。为生产服务、为消费服务是商业工作的基本任务。马克思曾经说过：“交换的深度、广度和方式都决定于生产的发展与结构，譬如，城乡之间的交换、乡村中的交换、城市中的交换等等。由此可见，交换在其所有一切要素上，或者是直接包含在生产中，或者是由生产决定。”（见“政治经济学批判导言”）因此，商业工作必须要适应生产发展的要求，适应工农业生产大跃进的要求，适应多快好省地建设社会主义的总要求。当前农村工作的中心是为实现农业生产的全面大跃进而努力，农村劳动力的使用和调配必须服从这一要求。商业工作如果能够随着这种情况的变化而相应发展，就能促进城乡交流，促进生产发展；如果不能相应变化以适应客观形势发展的需要，就必然影响城乡交流的畅通，阻碍生产的发展。
    目前，做商业工作的同志对于这种新形势存在两种不同的认识和态度。有些同志认为目前农村出现的这种新情况是合乎经济发展的规律的，认为农村商业工作必须采取新的工作方法和新的措施以适合这种新情况，因而必须紧紧依靠党委领导，依靠广大群众，千方百计地想办法解决存在的问题，找出能够适应新形势的工作方法和措施。安阳县正是这样做的，因此取得了成绩。有些同志却是采取另一种态度，他们看不见这种新情况的变化。客观形势已经向前发展了，他们的认识仍然停止在旧阶段。他们强调客观困难，甚至埋怨指责，工作方法停留在老一套。尽管有跃进的指标，但没有跃进的措施和干劲，以致收购不好的情况长期不能扭转。前一种认识，看到了主流，抓住了本质，所持的态度是促进派的态度，工作是生气勃勃的。后一种认识，只看到了支流，抓住的是现象，所持的态度是促退派的态度，工作是死气沉沉的。客观事物的变化永远是没有完结的，它总是循着自身的规律不断向前发展着、变化着。人们的思想认识必须随着变化了的客观情况而前进，才能把工作做好。安阳县的经验生动地证明了这一点。
    走群众路线是我们党和国家工作的基本路线。一切工作都必须发动和依靠群众才能做好，商业工作当然不能例外。安阳县在这方面取得的成功经验，给商业工作如何走群众路线和依靠群众办商业树立了一面旗帜。他们在宣传方法上、购销方法上、收购等级规格上和经营时间的安排上都贯彻了依靠群众和便利群众的原则，因而受到广大群众的欢迎。安阳县在结合勤工俭学提倡学生送蛋教员代收的同时，决定把按斤收购的办法改为按个收购，这样一改就解决了缺秤的问题，也解决了小学生按斤两算账的困难。看起来这好像是一个无关紧要的小问题，实质上这是关系到走不走群众路线的大问题。
    安阳县根据农村发生的新情况，发动农业社普遍建立了供销部，依靠群众办商业，收购农业社和社员需要出售的东西，供应农业社和社员需要购买的日用品。这样做的好处很多，首先是便利了群众，节省了劳动力，对支援农业生产有很大作用。其次是社干部和社员对供销部的经营都很关心，供销部同群众的联系也更加密切了。同时，供销部的营业员由农业社按劳记工分，农业社还可根据营业季节的旺淡调配人员。对出售给国家的农副产品的运输，农业社也便于统一安排劳动力及时运送。农业社建立供销部以后，不仅可以补助国营商业经营力量的不足，而且还可以通过供销部的购销活动，使商业、农业和金融工作更加密切地结合起来。因此，发动农业社建立供销部，依靠群众办商业，在国营商业的领导下从事农村购销活动，对国家、对农业社、对社员群众都是有好处的。
    安阳县的经验，不仅仅是解决了收购鸡蛋的方法问题，更重要的是进一步具体地证明了：商业工作必须要有鲜明的政治观点、生产观点和群众观点；只有克服脱离实际的右倾保守思想，认清目前的新形势，紧紧依靠党委领导，依靠群众办商业，采取新的工作方法和措施，商业工作才能大跃进。
