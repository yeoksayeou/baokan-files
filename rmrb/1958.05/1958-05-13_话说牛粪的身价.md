　　Speaking of Cow Dung's Status
　　He Keming
    Since the recent discovery that cow dung can feed pigs, cow dung has leaped from being a general fertilizer to a feed, and from the cowshed to the scientist's laboratory. This is also a leap forward in the great leap forward in rural production. If we want to raise more pigs, we must find more feed, but there is a contradiction between raising more pigs and having insufficient feed. The masses have tried every possible means to resolve this contradiction. As a result, the miracle of cow dung being able to feed pigs was finally discovered.
    The experience of Heshan County, Guangdong Province, in universally promoting cow dung to feed pigs has many enlightening aspects for us. This experience has a great impact on the pig and cattle raising industries. The pig and cattle raising industries will inevitably advance side by side. Cattle can plow fields, their meat can be eaten, their dung can fertilize fields, their hides can be made into leather shoes and suitcases, their bones can be made into fertilizer and toothbrushes, their horns can be made into combs and seals, and now it has been discovered that cow dung can feed pigs. Cattle are simply treasures from head to toe.
    This experience also precisely illustrates the endless potential for building socialism in the countryside and the great wisdom of the people. Cow dung, proven by the practice of the masses to be a good feed for pigs, is now being given scientific evaluation by scientists, which gives everyone more confidence and assurance in its widespread promotion. This shows how important it is to combine scientific knowledge with the experience of the masses. Only by going deep among the masses can scientific work open up new horizons and give full play to its strength. This proves that only by serving the workers and peasants and serving production can scientific workers have infinitely broad prospects. The great leap forward in agriculture has unveiled the prelude to the technological revolution. The combination of the wisdom of the masses and scientific workers is the source of the inexhaustible power of the technological revolution. With the combination of these two forces, mountains can be made to give way and rivers must bow their heads, creating the earth-shattering power to move mountains and drain the seas.
    Similar discoveries and creations to cow dung being able to feed pigs have recently blossomed everywhere: such as using manure to produce biogas for heating and lighting; using medicines to speed up the fattening of pigs; bindweed can eliminate mosquitoes and flies; wild plants can be used to make wine, sugar, oil, flour, cotton, paper, glue, and hemp; and the construction of water conservancy projects has also shown amazing boldness. Technical reforms have thousands of kinds of creations and clever plans... All these facts prove that our countryside is very large, and many treasures are waiting for us to discover, and many fields of knowledge are waiting for us to study. For the intellectuals who have been sent down to the countryside, it is precisely a "place to use their talents," and it is very promising to become both red and expert. The problem lies with the intellectuals and scientific workers themselves. If they still believe that only by reading big books and only by squatting in the laboratory can they become "expert" and famous, then it is not only a wrong idea, but also very stupid.

### 话说牛粪的身价

　　话说牛粪的身价
　　何科明
    自从最近发现牛粪可以喂猪以后，牛粪就从一般的肥料一跃而为一种饲料，从牛栏跃进到科学家化验室里了。这也是农村生产大跃进中的一个跃进。我们要多养猪，就得多找饲料，但是多养猪和饲料不足是有矛盾的，群众就千方百计地要解决这个矛盾。于是，终于发现了牛粪可以喂猪这个奇迹。
    广东鹤山县普遍推广牛粪喂猪的经验，对我们有许多启发。这个经验对养猪和养牛的事业发生很大影响。养猪业和养牛业必然并肩前进。牛，可以耕田，肉可食，粪可肥田，皮可做皮鞋皮箱，骨可做肥料，也可做牙刷，角可做梳子也可刻印章，现在又发现牛粪可以喂猪。牛，简直一身都是宝。
    这个经验也正说明农村里建设社会主义的无穷无尽的潜力和人民群众的伟大的智慧。牛粪，由群众的实践证明是猪的好饲料，现在由科学家给予科学上的评价，就使大家普遍推广更有信心和把握。这说明，科学知识和群众的经验结合起来是多么重要。科学工作只有深入群众才能开辟新的天地，才能发挥自己的力量，这证明科学工作者只有为工农服务，为生产服务，才有无限广阔的前途。农业大跃进揭开了技术革命的序幕，群众的智慧和科学工作者结合，就是技术革命的力量无穷无尽的源泉。有了这两种力量的结合会起高山可以让路，河水必须低头的移山倒海的作用。
    类似牛粪可以喂猪的发现和创造，最近真如遍地开花：如利用粪便制造沼气发热发光；用药品加快猪的肥胖速度；打破碗花花可以消灭蚊蝇；野生植物可制酒、糖、油、粉、棉、纸、胶、麻；兴修水利也表现出惊人的气魄。技术改革，有千种万样的创造和妙计……这些事实，无不证明我国的农村很大，有很多宝贝正待我们去发现，有很多学问正待我们去钻研。对于下放到农村的知识分子说来，正是到了“用武之地”，红深专透是大有可为。问题就在于知识分子和科学工作者们自己了。如果还认为只有读大部头书，只有蹲在研究室里，才能“专”出名堂来，那就不仅仅是错误的思想，而且是十分愚蠢的。
