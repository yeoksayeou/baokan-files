Reported by this newspaper: Since the rectification campaign, a new cooperative and mutual aid relationship of "I am for everyone, everyone is for me" is beginning to emerge among the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Railways, and the First Ministry of Commerce.

The relationship among these three ministries is extremely close in the work of coal production, transportation, and sales, but cooperation has not been good for a long time. For example, there are often abnormal situations of "coal without trains, trains without coal" between coal mines and railway units. When coal mine departments supply coal to commercial departments, it is often "no contact in the early part of the month, just a glimpse in the middle of the month, and all come together in the latter part of the month." Therefore, some business problems are entangled for a long time, and sometimes even go to court, affecting normal relations between departments and causing losses to production.

During the rectification movement, on the basis of criticizing departmentalism and conservative thinking, these three ministries showed a surge of cooperation and mutual assistance, treating the difficulties of others as their own. Some places have also put forward "four cooperative medicines": be lenient in blaming others and strict in blaming oneself; do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself; proactively provide convenience to others when it does not harm oneself and benefits others; subordinate small interests to large interests, and current interests to long-term interests. Many problems that have not been solved for many years have been solved smoothly. The Heishan Coal Mine of the Jinan Coal Management Bureau and the Badou Station on the railway have long been uncooperative. The station did not stop the goods transported to the mine at the location designated by the mine, causing the mine to waste tens of thousands of yuan in handling fees every year. Once, the mine transported a large motor, which the station could have delivered in a few minutes by locomotive, but the station refused to deliver it, forcing the mine to spend four days and four nights with dozens of people to move it. Now, the situation has completely changed. When the station loads and transports goods to the mine, it completely follows the needs of the mine. Once, the stationmaster saw that there was a lot of coal and not enough cars, causing losses due to coal falling to the ground, so he took the initiative to contact and increase the number of vehicles; the leading cadres of the mine saw that the workers did not have time to load the cars, fearing that it would affect the turnover of vehicles, so they personally went to the coal bunker to dig coal. This not only ensured the transportation of coal, but also accelerated the turnover of vehicles. For example, the Xishan Mining Bureau's transportation plan for 1957 almost failed every month. The mine did not check its own shortcomings, but blamed the station. It also did not solve some reasonable demands of the station, such as the small coal bunker, insufficient coal capacity, which affected the completion of the transportation plan. After the cooperation meeting in March and April this year, the Xishan Mining Bureau examined its erroneous thinking, took the initiative to propose guarantees to the station, and completed the task of expanding the coal bunker in one month. The station also took the initiative to establish "cooperatives" at the three stations that loaded coal for the bureau, implementing unified operations and unified command. The joint road-mine office, which had not been established for several years, was also established in May.

In the relationship between commercial departments and coal mine departments, there was also more mutual blame and less self-criticism in the past; now it is different. They have learned about each other's production situation and difficulties through mutual visits. The manager of the Beijing Dongsi District Wholesale Store of China Coal Construction Company said: Through visiting the mine, I realized that it is really not easy for coal mine workers to produce, which strengthened our determination to serve production. The comrades in the coal mine said after the visit: Seeing a large amount of gangue in the coal transported to the market, causing political and economic losses to the country, it is really painful. In the future, we are determined to reduce gangue going out of the well. Now, coal mines and commercial departments are fully cooperating to fight for the elimination of gangue through experimental fields.

The emergence of new cooperative relationships has enabled continuous leaps in production. The Xishan Mining Bureau mentioned above, which failed to complete its plan every month in 1957, has overfulfilled its task every month since cooperation. The coal loading time of coal mines across the country has been greatly shortened. For example, the Fuxin Mining Bureau shortened it by one hour and three minutes in April, and the Jiawang Mining Bureau shortened it by more than two hours. In shortening the coal transportation mileage, January 1958 was shortened by thirty-seven kilometers compared with 1957.

### 服了协作药　关系大改变  煤炭部、铁道部、第一商业部在煤炭产运销工作中密切合作

    服了协作药　关系大改变
    煤炭部、铁道部、第一商业部在煤炭产运销工作中密切合作
    本报讯　整风以来，煤炭工业部、铁道部和第一商业部之间，正开始出现“我为人人，人人为我”的新的协作互助关系。
    这三个部在煤炭产运销工作中，关系极为密切，但是长期以来协作得不好。如煤矿与铁路两个单位，经常出现“有煤无车，有车无煤”的不正常情况，煤矿部门在供应商业部门煤炭时，也常常是“上旬不见面，中旬刚露头，下旬一齐来”。因此，一些业务问题，长期纠缠不清，有时甚至要闹到法院，影响部门之间的正常关系，使生产受到损失。
    在整风运动中，这三个部在批判本位主义和保守思想的基础上，出现了协作互助的热潮，把别人的困难当成自己的困难。有些地方还提出“四味协作药”：责人宽责己严；己所不欲，勿施于人；在于己无损、于人有利的情况下，主动予人以方便；小利益服从大利益，目前利益服从长远利益等有积极意义和高尚风格的口号，许多长年代没有解决的问题，顺利地解决了。济南煤管局黑山煤矿和铁路上的八陡车站过去长期互不配合，车站运给矿山的东西，不按矿山指定地点停车，使矿山每年浪费几万元的搬运费。有一次，矿山运到一台大型电机，车站用机车运送，几分钟就可以送到了，但是，车站就是不给送，害得矿山不得不用几十个人花四天四夜的时间搬过去。现在，情况完全改变了。车站在给矿山装运东西时，完全按照矿山需要，有一次，车站站长看到煤炭很多，车皮不够，造成产煤落地的损失，就主动联系增调车辆；矿上的领导干部看到工人来不及装车时，怕影响车辆周转，就亲自到煤仓去扒煤。这样，既能保证煤炭运出，又加速了车辆的周转。再如西山矿务局1957年运输计划几乎月月落空，矿山不检查自己的缺点，却一味责怪车站，对于车站的某些合理要求，比如煤仓小，容煤太少，影响运输计划完成等等问题也不给解决。在今年3、4月份协作会议以后，西山矿务局检查了错误思想，主动向车站提出保证条件，并以一个月的时间，突击完成扩大煤仓的任务。车站也主动在给该局装煤的三个车站成立了“合作社”，实行统一作业，统一指挥。几年来，没有成立起来的路、矿联合办公室，也在5月份成立起来了。
    在商业部门和煤矿部门的关系上，过去也是互相责怪多，自我批评少；现在不同了，他们通过互相参观、访问，了解到相互生产中的情况和困难。中国煤建公司北京东四区批发商店经理说：通过下井参观，体会到煤矿工人生产实在不容易，加强了我们为生产服务的决心。煤矿上的同志参观后则说：看到煤里的?石大批运到市场，给国家造成政治上、经济上的损失，实在痛心，今后决心减少?石出井。现在，煤矿和商业部门，正在全力协作，通过搞试验田，为消灭?石作斗争。
    新的协作关系的出现，使生产不断跃进。前面提到的在1957年月月不能完成计划的西山矿务局，自从协作以来，月月超额完成任务。全国煤矿装车时间大大缩短，如阜新矿务局4月份缩短一小时零三分钟，贾汪矿务局缩短了二小时以上。在缩短煤炭运输里程上，1958年1月份比1957年缩短了三十七公里。
