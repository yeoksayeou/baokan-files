    Wuhan State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill Starts Construction
    (Our dispatch) The Wuhan State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill began construction on May 8th in Yujiatou, Wuchang. The total area of the factory is 300,000 square meters, with factory buildings and workshops covering 60,000 to 70,000 square meters alone. This is equivalent to twice the size of the current Wuhan State-owned No. 1 Cotton Mill. Once completed, it can accommodate 5,000 workers producing simultaneously.
