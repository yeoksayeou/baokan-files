　　Heart of a Child
　　Yun Nan
　　Ever since Wenwen started kindergarten, her "eloquence" has gradually become "refined." Although she hasn't yet reached the stage of "quoting extensively from classics," she can at least "say everything with a source." For example:
　　"Mom, don't forget to wash my hair and give me a bath tomorrow." Then, she twisted her little face, pouted slightly, and glared at her mother, saying: "The teacher said, not bathing will make you sick."
　　"The teacher said, liars are bad children."
　　"The teacher said, sing properly, don't shout at the top of your lungs."
　　"The teacher said..."
　　"The teacher said..."
　　When it comes to other things, there's always room for discussion, but "the teacher said this and that" is an attitude of "speaking with authority, brooking no argument."
　　We aren't old fogeys unable to accept new things, so this new trend naturally caught the attention of my wife and me. After the children went to sleep, we quietly held a few small meetings and unanimously agreed that our past "commandism" towards the children was completely ineffective in the face of "the teacher said," and we should overcome it as soon as possible to avoid losing our authority as parents. I thought, the teachers probably didn't realize that the little ones they were teaching had already become teachers in every family.
　　However, in our rapidly changing society, "unforeseen" things are constantly emerging. At dusk, I was reading the newspaper when a child's voice came: "Dad, the teacher said you can't jump right after eating." Without taking my eyes off the newspaper, I casually responded with a "hmm."
　　"Look, Caicai is jumping!"
　　Only then did I realize that it was An'an, who hadn't even started kindergarten yet, who was speaking. When did "the teacher said" reach her mouth? I closed the newspaper and asked her with a smile, "An'an, who is your teacher?" She first smiled shyly, then looked at her older sister, and said to me seriously, "Um, it's Teacher Zhang." Teacher Zhang is originally Wenwen's teacher, An'an has never even seen her, and Teacher Zhang wouldn't even know there's such a "private disciple."
　　An'an's answer naturally made my wife and me laugh. The children didn't know the reason for our laughter, but they were also infected by this happy emotion. Immediately, this small room was filled with innocent laughter, making me feel like the room was indeed a little smaller.
　　I thought: What a tremendous power the education of teachers and parents has exerted in those hearts of children!

　　赤子之心
　　运南
    文文自从进了幼儿园，“谈吐”就渐渐的显得“不俗”了。虽然她还没有能达到“引经据典”的境地，可是也居然是“语语有出处”。譬如：
    “妈妈，明天可别忘了给我洗头、洗澡”。接着，他把小脸儿一扭，微微的鼓着嘴，冲妈妈瞪着眼说：“老师说的，不洗澡会生病”。
    “老师说的，说假话的是坏孩子”。
    “老师说的，唱歌要好好儿唱，不许直着嗓子嚷”。
    “老师说的……”。
    “老师说的……”。
    提到别的事情，总还有个商量余地，唯独“老师说的如何如何”则就是一种“语出有据，不容置辩”的态度。
    我们到还不是不能接受新鲜事物的老朽，这种新的倾向自然也引起了我和我爱人的注意。等孩子们睡觉以后，我们也悄悄地开过几个小会，一致认为过去对孩子们的某些“命令主义”在“老师说的”面前全然不起作用了，应该及早克服，免得丧失做父母的威信。我想，老师们也许没有想到，她们所教育的那群娃娃已经在每个家庭里当上了老师。
    可是，在我们这个日新月异的社会里，“没有想到”的事情实在是层出不穷的。黄昏，我正在看报，一个孩子的声音传来了：“爸爸，老师说的，刚吃完饭是不能跳的”。我眼睛没离开报纸，漫不经心地应了一声“唔”。
    “你看，采采在跳哪”！
    我这才察觉说话的原来是还没有上幼儿园的安安。什么时候“老师说的”已经传到她的嘴里去了呢？我合上报纸笑着问她：“安安，谁是你的老师”？她先不好意思的笑了一笑，然后看了看姊姊，又郑重其事的对我说：“嗯，是张老师”。张老师原是文文的老师，安安根本没有看见过，张老师也不会知道还有这样一位“私淑弟子”。
    安安的这个回答自然把我和我爱人都引笑了。孩子们不会知道我们笑的原因，但他们也感染了这种欢快的情感，立刻，在这小小的屋子里洋溢着一片天真的笑声，使我感到这间屋子似乎确实小了一些。
    我想道：老师、家长的教育，在那一颗颗赤子之心里发生了多么巨大的力量啊！
