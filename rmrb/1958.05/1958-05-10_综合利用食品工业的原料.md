Comprehensive Utilization of Raw Materials in the Food Industry
Rong Wenzuo

The food industry is basically an agricultural and livestock product processing industry. After agricultural products are processed into food, only a small portion becomes food, and the vast majority becomes residue and waste. Only a dozen or so jin of sugar, oil, alcohol, or starch are produced from every hundred jin of raw materials. However, the resulting beet pulp, bagasse, oilseed cake, distiller's grains, and starch residue are several times greater in quantity than the food produced. In addition, meat and fruit processing also leave a lot of waste and scraps. In the past, these things were improperly used, resulting in a significant loss of resources.

Over the past year, food industries in various regions have begun to pay attention to the comprehensive utilization of resources. Summarizing the situation, the comprehensive utilization of raw materials in the food industry has the following benefits:

I. Increasing the production volume of the food industry, increasing variety, and accelerating the development of the food industry. Some food factories have doubled or even increased several times their total output value and product variety after comprehensively utilizing raw materials. In addition, using cold-pressed soybean cake to make tofu and using soybean cake and soybean meal to make soy sauce and monosodium glutamate can play a significant role in increasing oil production and solving the problem of insufficient edible oil supply.

II. Supporting agricultural production and promoting rural economic prosperity. Some oil and alcohol factories use distiller's grains and oilseed cake mixed with rice straw, corn cobs, eggshells, shells, and other materials to process mixed feed for farmers, which is worth promoting vigorously. Some alcohol factories purchase starch residue from farmers after flour production to brew alcohol or for other uses, which increases farmers' incomes, and is also a good method.

III. It can reduce the cost of products. Generally, it can be reduced by several to dozens of percent. The purchase price of raw materials for some starch factories is 100 yuan per ton, but the by-products sold, such as starch residue and corn germ, are worth 48 yuan, which is equivalent to recovering half of the value of the raw materials. In addition, the utilization of some by-products, such as extracting wax from rice bran oil, can also improve the quality of the product, which is a win-win situation.

At present, the basic situation of the food industry in terms of comprehensive utilization of raw material resources is:

I. Most of the main raw material resources of the food industry, such as various sugar crops, oil crops, seawater and well brine, fruits and vegetables, livestock products, corn, and tuber grains, have begun to develop towards comprehensive utilization and have achieved great results. For example, Jiangsu Province's experience in using distiller's grains to process mixed feed and Shanghai's experience in using cold-pressed soybeans to replicate tofu are very good and have begun to be promoted nationwide.

II. Some resources are not fully or reasonably utilized. For example, the waste molasses from sugar factories is now fully utilized to make molasses alcohol. However, most sugar factories can only utilize beet pulp for feed and bagasse for fuel or papermaking, and have not been able to further utilize beet pulp and bagasse to make rayon.

III. Some regions and enterprises still have serious waste of raw material resources. For example, burying pig blood and distiller's grains in pits, letting starch residue flow down the sewers, discarding fruit peels, fruit residue, and pig and cattle internal organs at will, and using soybeans directly as feed, etc.

Today, the People's Daily publishes a collection of relevant materials, indicating that the comprehensive utilization of raw materials in the food industry has great potential. It is hoped that comrades in the national food industry departments can take this work seriously.

    综合利用食品工业的原料
    戎文佐
    食品工业基本上是农牧产品加工工业。农产品加工食品后，只一小部分变成食品，绝大部分都变成渣滓和糟粕，每一百斤原料只出糖十几斤，出油、酒或淀粉十几斤到几十斤。但是出产的甜菜废丝、甘蔗渣、油饼、酒糟和淀粉渣子等却比食品要多好几倍。此外，肉类和水果加工后，也会留下许多废料下脚。过去对这些东西用得不当，使大量资料遭受损失。
    一年来各地食品工业开始注意对资源的综合利用。归纳起来，综合利用食品工业原料有下面几个好处：
    一、增加食品工业的生产量，增多品种，加速食品工业的发展。有的食品工厂在综合作用原材料后，生产总值和产品品种增加了一倍到几倍。另外，如利用冷榨豆饼做豆腐，利用豆饼、豆粕做酱油和味素，对增产油脂、解决食油供应不足的问题能起很大作用。
    二、支援农业生产，繁荣农村经济。有些油、酒厂利用酒糟和油饼掺入稻秸、玉米芯、蛋壳、贝壳等材料为农民加工混合饲料，值得大力推广。有些酒厂收购农民制粉后的淀粉渣子酿酒或做其他用途，增加了农民收入，也是好办法。
    三、可以降低产品的成本。一般可以降低百分之几到百分之几十。有些淀粉厂的原料进厂价是每吨一百元，但是出售的副产品，如淀粉渣子、玉米胚等却值四十八元，等于收回原料价值的一半。此外，对有些副产品的利用，如在糠油中提取糠腊后，还可以提高产品的质量，更是一举数得的事。
    现在，食品工业在综合利用原料资源方面的基本情况是：
    一、大多数食品工业的主要原料资源，如各种糖料作物、油料作物、海水和井卤水、果蔬、畜产品、玉米和薯类等粮食原料都已经开始向综合利用的方向发展，并且已经取得很大成绩。如江苏省利用酒糟加工混合饲料；上海市利用冷榨大豆复制豆腐等经验都很好，并已开始在全国推广。
    二、有些资源还利用得不全或不尽合理；如糖厂的废蜜现在已全部利用做糖蜜酒精。但大多数糖厂还只能做到利用废丝做饲料和利用甘蔗渣做燃料或造纸，没有能进一步做到用甜菜废丝和甘蔗渣做人造纤维。
    三、有些地区和企业还有严重的浪费原料资源的现象。如把猪血和酒糟挖坑埋掉，让淀粉渣子顺着下水道流走，把果皮、果渣和猪牛内脏等随便扔掉，把大豆直接做饲料等等。
    今天人民日报集中发表了一些有关材料，说明综合利用食品工业的原料确是大有可为。希望全国食品工业部门的同志，能把这件工作切实重视起来。
