Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 22nd: The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will soon establish fifteen small refineries. Fifteen sets of refining equipment have been manufactured at the Dushanzi Refinery of the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration and were recently donated to the construction units.

These fifteen refineries will be able to produce 675,000 kilograms of gasoline, diesel, and kerosene annually.

The small refining furnace, designed and manufactured by the workers of the Dushanzi Refinery, requires a total investment of only 50 yuan for all equipment. It can refine one batch of crude oil in seven hours, with each batch processing 100 kilograms of crude oil.

To accelerate the development of small-scale refining, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently convened a local petroleum industry conference in the Dushanzi mining area, attended by representatives from twelve counties. At the meeting, workers from the Dushanzi Refinery taught the attending representatives the technology for operating the refining equipment. Geologists also assisted the county representatives by visiting sites with oil seeps and teaching them how to identify oil seeps and extract oil. After receiving the fifteen sets of refining equipment and mastering the refining and extraction methods, the county representatives guaranteed that all fifteen refineries would be put into production before "July 1st."

This batch of small refineries is the first pilot project for Xinjiang's local petroleum industry. Natural oil seeps have been discovered in vast areas both north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, providing very favorable conditions for the widespread development of the local petroleum industry. After these refineries are built, small refineries will continue to be built wherever oil seeps are found.

    新疆建设十五座小炼油厂
    独山子职工赠送建厂单位全套设备并传授技术
    新华社乌鲁木齐22日电　新疆维吾尔自治区很快就要办起十五座小型炼油厂。十五套炼油设备已经在新疆石油管理局独山子炼油厂制造好，并且在最近赠给了建厂单位。
    这十五座炼油厂每年可以生产汽油、柴油和煤油六十七万五千公斤。
    独山子炼油厂职工设计并制成的这种土造的小型炼炉，全部设备投资只要五十元，七小时就能炼一炉原油，每炉能炼原油一百公斤。
    为了加快小型炼油事业的发展，中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会最近在独山子矿区召开了有十二个县代表参加的地方石油工业会议。会上，独山子炼油厂职工把操作炼油设备的技术传授给了到会代表，地质人员还帮助各县代表到有油苗的现场教授了识别油苗的方法和采油方法。各县代表接受了十五套炼油设备和掌握了炼油、采油的方法以后，保证这十五座炼油厂在“七一”前全部投入生产。
    这批小型炼油厂是新疆地方石油工业第一批试点厂。新疆天山南北广大地区都发现了天然石油的油苗露头，给地方石油工业遍地开花提供了十分有利的条件。这批炼油厂建成以后，将继续在凡有油苗露头的地方，普遍兴建小型炼油厂。
