Xinhua News Agency, London, May 18th: The British workers' strike struggle is gaining momentum daily. The strike of 50,000 London bus workers for wage increases has lasted nearly two weeks. Their heroic struggle has received strong support from many trade union organizations.

Workers at the Swindon steel rolling mill have also staged a large-scale strike to demand higher wages. Five hundred workers at the Romford machine manufacturing factory have also begun a strike demanding wage increases. The strike of 6,500 workers at London's Smithfield Central Meat Market, which began on May 12, is still ongoing. This strike was held to protest the employer's plan to lay off 600 meat delivery workers.

Two thousand two hundred and fifty dockworkers and seven hundred and fifty cold storage workers in London also joined the strike on the 15th to support the struggle of the meat market workers.

After a three-month strike, the shipbuilders at Belfast's "Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding Company" finally forced the factory to agree to discuss the issue of wage increases. They have resumed work after achieving initial victory.

The British government's policy of freezing wages and the employers' measures to dismiss workers are facing increasingly resolute resistance from British workers.
