　　Breaking Superstition and Boldly Adopting New Technologies:
　　Xiangyang Special District Achieves Consecutive Years of Increased Summer Crop Production

　　(Our report) Our correspondent Fang Di reports: Summer crops in the Xiangyang Special District of Hubei Province are growing exceptionally well, and it is estimated that both total output and per-unit yield may more than double compared to last year. The experience of this special district in achieving a bumper harvest of summer crops proves that educating the broad masses of cadres and the people to break superstitions and achieve a great liberation in thought is a very important key to realizing a leap forward in production. Agricultural workers from various parts of the province and some other provinces who have recently visited here generally believe that this experience is very important and worth promoting.

　　The experience of Xiangyang Special District proves that the two major links in promoting a bumper harvest of summer crops are: it is necessary to do a good job in winter sowing and field management. To do a good job means to boldly adopt new experiences and new technologies, and to negate old experiences and old technologies, which means carrying out technological innovation in the above two major links. The content of innovation in this regard is very broad, such as changing from spot sowing and sparse planting to row sowing and dense planting, changing from less tilling and shallow tilling to more tilling and deep tilling, and changing from no base fertilizer to applying sufficient base fertilizer, etc. In terms of field management, it is necessary to scientifically carry out topdressing, weeding, irrigation, drainage, and pest control, etc., according to the requirements of protecting seedlings, protecting ears, protecting grains, and preventing insects, waterlogging, and lodging. Facts show that those who have grasped these two major links well will inevitably achieve a bumper harvest, and the better they are grasped, the more prominent the bumper harvest will be.

　　However, it is not enough to simply say that the broad masses of cadres and the people should dare to boldly adopt new experiences and new technologies, and negate those outdated things. The most important prerequisite here is to educate them to break the superstitious thinking about old farming habits and farming methods, and to liberate themselves from the shackles of empiricism and dogmatism. As early as 1954 and 1955, Gucheng and other two counties in this special district had already seen high-yield models of wheat production of 700 and 800 jin per mu due to row sowing and dense planting. At that time, the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party also summarized these two high-yield experiences and required various places to organize and promote them, but they did not receive the desired results. Even Gucheng and other two counties did not universally apply this experience originating in their own counties. Some areas had already densely planted, but they were always afraid that it would not be safe, so they weeded out a batch of seedlings during each weeding, and finally it became sparse planting again. Why did the above phenomenon occur? Because people's minds had not yet been liberated, they were still superstitious about the old practices, and they did not believe that summer crops could produce high yields.

　　How can we enable the broad masses of cadres and the people to break superstitions and liberate their minds? The effective experience of Xiangyang Special District is: to continuously strengthen political and ideological work from beginning to end, and to educate the broad masses of cadres and the people by constantly using mass-based summary and inspection methods. This approach has gradually formed through the practice of the past year or more. As mentioned earlier, a few years ago, we summarized and promoted the high-yield experiences of the masses, but the effect was not good. After the sowing of summer crops last year (in the winter before last year), we began to adopt a new approach, that is, to use the method of mobilizing the masses to visit, evaluate, and debate to conduct a mass-based summary of the sowing work. When the crops were about to mature, such a summary was conducted again, and on this basis, the sowing work for this year's summer crops was arranged as early as possible. The advantage of this approach is that through visits, evaluations, and debates, the advantages and disadvantages of different farming methods can be clearly seen, making it easier for everyone to break superstitions, liberate their minds, and consciously master new experiences and new technologies. Last year, due to this approach, the field management of summer crops was greatly strengthened, which increased the yield of summer crops last year by nearly half compared to the previous year. And this year's summer crops, because the sowing work was arranged as early as possible on the basis of the summer crop summary last year, gave the broad masses of cadres and the people sufficient time to debate and prepare for the sowing work before sowing. As a result, a series of new experiences and new technologies were promoted in both sowing and field management, and the growth of crops has taken a big leap forward compared to last year.

　　The experience of Xiangyang Special District in organizing a bumper harvest of summer crops has received great attention from the relevant leading departments in Hubei Province. Recently, the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized leading cadres from various prefectural committees, county committees, and relevant agricultural departments to visit this special district for on-site visits. Hunan, Henan, Zhejiang and other provinces have also sent representatives to visit here. People are very interested in the relevant experience and believe that it is worth promoting in organizing the great leap forward in the production of various agricultural crops.

### 破除迷信，大胆采用新技术  襄阳专区夏收作物连年增产

　　破除迷信，大胆采用新技术
　　襄阳专区夏收作物连年增产
    本报讯　记者方堤报道：湖北省襄阳专区夏收作物生长情况空前良好，预计无论是总产或单产都可能比去年增产一倍还多。这个专区夏收作物大丰产的经验证明：教育广大干部和群众破除迷信，在思想上来个大解放，是实现生产跃进的极重要的关键。最近前往这里参观的省内各地和一些外省的农业工作者，普遍认为这一经验很重要，值得推广。
    襄阳专区的经验证明，促使夏收作物丰产的两大环节是：必须作好冬播和田间管理工作。所谓作好，是指大胆地采用新经验、新技术，否定旧经验、旧技术，也就是要在上述两大环节上进行技术革新。这方面的革新内容是很广泛的，如在播种时要改点播、稀植为条播、密植，改少耕、浅耕为多耕、深耕，和改不施底肥为施足底肥等；在田间管理方面，则要根据保株、保穗、保粒和防虫、防渍、防倒的要求，科学地进行追肥、锄草、灌溉、排渍、治虫等。事实说明，凡是把这两大环节抓好了的，就必然获得丰产，越抓得好丰产就越突出。
    可是，要广大干部和群众敢于大胆地采用新经验，新技术，而对那些已经过时的旧东西加以否定，却不是一说就行的。这里最重要的前提，是要教育他们破除对旧耕作习惯和耕作方法的迷信思想，从经验主义和教条主义的束缚中解放出来。早在1954年和1955年，这个专区的谷城等两县，就曾经出现过由于条播，密植而亩产小麦七百斤和八百斤的高产典型，当时中共襄阳地委也曾总结过这两项高产经验、要求各地组织推广，可是都没有收到应有的效果，就是谷城等两县也没有把这种出在本县的经验普遍运用。有些地区本来已经密植了，可是总怕不保险，结果锄一次草就锄去一批苗，最后还是成了稀植。为什么会产生上述现象？因为人们的思想还没有解放，他们还迷信着旧的作法，还不相信夏收作物能够高产。
    怎样才能使广大干部和群众破除迷信、解放思想呢？襄阳专区行之有效的经验是：一贯到底地加强政治思想工作，用不断地通过群众性的总结、检查的方法，教育广大干部和群众。这种作法是经过最近一年多的实践逐渐形成的。如前所述，几年前这里就总结和推广过群众的高产经验，但是效果并不好。到去年的夏收作物播种后（在前年冬天），这里开始采用了一种新的作法，即采用发动群众参观、评比、辩论的方法，对播种工作进行群众性的总结。到作物快成熟时，这样的总结又进行了一次，并在此基础上及早地部署了今年夏收作物的播种工作。这种作法的好处是：通过参观、评比、辩论，可以把不同耕作方法的优点和缺点看得一清二楚，因而容易使大家破除迷信，解放思想，自觉地掌握新经验和新技术。去年，由于这样作后，夏收作物的田间管理工作大大地加强了，因而使去年夏收产量较前年提高近一半。而今年的夏收作物，因为在去年夏收总结的基础上及早对播种工作进行了部署，使广大干部和群众在播种前有充分时间对播种工作进行辩论、准备，结果，使播种和田间管理都推行了一系列的新经验和新技术，作物的生长情况较去年又大大地跃进了一步。
    襄阳专区组织夏收作物大丰产的经验受到了湖北省各有关领导部门的极大重视。最近，中共湖北省委曾组织各地委、县委和有关农业部门的领导干部，到这个专区进行现场参观。湖南、河南、浙江等省也先后派代表到这里进行访问。人们对有关经验很感兴趣，认为在组织各种农业作物的生产大跃进中都值得推广。
