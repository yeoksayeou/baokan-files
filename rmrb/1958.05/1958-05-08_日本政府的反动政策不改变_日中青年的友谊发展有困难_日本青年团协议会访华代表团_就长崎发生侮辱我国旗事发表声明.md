Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th May. The visiting delegation of the Japan Youth Organization Council, currently in Shanghai, issued the following written statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters tonight regarding the incident of insulting the Chinese national flag in Nagasaki on May 2nd:

    "Our delegation expresses its heartfelt regret to all the Chinese people regarding this incident.

    The Japan Youth Organization Council hopes that Japan and the People's Republic of China will restore diplomatic relations. For the peace and friendship of the people of both countries and the people of the world, we have been working to promote exchanges and friendship between the youth of the two countries.

    However, it is regrettable that the Kishida Nobusuke government of our country is contrary to the wishes of our youth and is unwilling to recognize the People's Republic of China.

    Through this incident, we have further clearly realized how contradictory the political direction of our country is to the ideas and actions of our youth who hope for peace and are working for it.

    Our delegation has traveled more than ten thousand kilometers in China for more than twenty days. During our visit, we personally experienced the deep friendship and love of peace of the Chinese youth and people. We are determined to respond to it with the sincere feelings and actions of Japanese youth. Our visit to China will soon come to an end. We believe that if we do not strive to fundamentally change the reactionary policies currently adopted by the Japanese government, then the development of friendly exchanges between Chinese and Japanese youth in the future will also be difficult. We believe that as long as we continue to strengthen the friendship between the youth and people of Japan and China, world peace can be established.

    Finally, we hope that through your news agency, the opinions of our delegation on this incident and our sincere feelings for the Chinese people will be conveyed to all the Chinese people.

    Delegation of the Japan Youth Organization Council

    日本政府的反动政策不改变  日中青年的友谊发展有困难
    日本青年团协议会访华代表团
    就长崎发生侮辱我国旗事发表声明
    新华社上海7日电　现在上海访问的日本青年团协议会访华代表团今天晚上就5月2日在长崎所发生的侮辱中国国旗的事件，向新华社记者发表书面声明如下：
    “我们代表团就此事件向全中国人民表示衷心的遗憾。
    日本青年团协议会希望日本和中华人民共和国恢复国交，为了两国人民以及世界人民的和平和友谊，我们曾为交流两国青年的友谊而努力。
    但是，遗憾的是我国岸信介政府和我们青年的愿望相反，不愿承认中华人民共和国。
    通过这次事件，我们更进一步明确地认识到，我国的政治方向同希望和平并为此而努力的我国青年的想法和行动是多么矛盾。
    我们代表团访问中国二十多天以来，行经一万数千公里，在访问中我们亲身体会到中国青年及人民的友谊和对和平的热爱是多么深切。我们决心用日本青年的真挚感情和行动来响应它。我们在中国的访问不久即将结束，我们认为如果不努力根本改变日本政府现在所采取的反动政策，那么今后日中两国青年的友好往来的发展也是困难的，我们相信只要我们不断努力加强日中两国青年及人民的友好，世界的和平就能建立起来。
    最后，希望通过贵通讯社，把我们代表团对此事件的意见和对中国人民的真挚感情传达给全中国人民。
    日本青年团协议会访华代表团
