Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 28th - The strike by workers at the Tata Steel Company in Jamshedpur, Bihar, India, has continued for two weeks as of the 28th. On the morning of the 28th, the Tata Steel Company's management announced the reopening of the factory and issued entry permits to workers who had signed the so-called "good conduct agreement."

Tanji, General Secretary of the All-India Trade Union Congress, told reporters in Jamshedpur on the 27th that the company management's issuance of new entry permits meant that a pre-determined plan of layoffs and persecution of workers had begun to be implemented. Police have arrested Kedar Das, General Secretary of the Jamshedpur Trade Union and Communist member of the Bihar Legislative Assembly. As of the 27th, a total of approximately 260 workers and labor leaders have been arrested, including Habib-ul Rahman, Chairman of the Bihar General Trade Union. Meanwhile, troops entered Jamshedpur again on the 26th.

Trade unions throughout India support the struggle of the Tata Steel Company workers. The United Trade Union Congress issued a statement condemning the police for firing on workers in Jamshedpur.

    印度塔塔钢铁公司
    罢工已经两星期
    据新华社新德里28日电　印度比哈尔邦詹谢普尔地方塔塔钢铁公司工人的罢工斗争到28日已经持续了两星期。塔塔钢铁公司的资方28日上午宣布要工厂重新开工，并且把入厂证发给那些签订了所谓“好行为契约”的工人。
    全印工会大会总书记丹吉27日在詹谢普尔对新闻记者说，公司资方发出新的入厂证意味着裁减和迫害工人的一项预定计划已经开始执行。警察已经逮捕了詹谢普尔工会总书记、比哈尔邦议会的共产党议员克达尔·达斯。到27日为止一共逮捕了约二百六十名工人和工人领袖，包括比哈尔邦总工会主席哈比布尔·拉赫曼在内。同时，军队在26日再次开进了詹谢普尔。
    印度各地的工会都支持塔塔钢铁公司工人的斗争。统一工会大会发表声明，谴责警察对詹谢普尔的工人开火。
