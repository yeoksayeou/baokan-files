　　The Old Lady's Gratitude
　　Fu Dong, Jin Cheng
　　Several buses had arrived from Wuqing, and many people had gotten off, but construction worker Wang Junchen was anxiously waiting for his mother, who was nowhere to be seen.

　　He thought, "We agreed that I would wait here at the Dongsi station, why isn't she here? Could it be that the old lady forgot to get off and went all the way to the Wangfu station, the final stop?" He hurried there, but still couldn't find her. What was going on? Wang Junchen wondered if she had gone to the zoo. He had previously told her that after getting off the bus at Beijing Dongsi station, she could take a trolleybus to the zoo and then transfer to bus number 32 to get to Haidian. But the trouble was that he hadn't told her the name of the street in Haidian where he lived, or the house number. Maybe she just remembered the word "zoo"? He rushed there, but was disappointed again. He was so worried that he was covered in sweat.

　　He returned home in a daze, already at eleven o'clock at night. The people in the courtyard were also worried, and everyone took lanterns and went outside to search, but after searching for a long time, they still couldn't find her. That night, no one in the family closed their eyes.

　　Early the next morning, the whole family went out and searched separately. The eldest son went to the Summer Palace station, the second son went to the Peking University station, and Wang Junchen himself went to the Wangfu station. They were busy all day, but still found nothing.

　　Where had the old lady gone? She had come to Beijing on February 23rd. When she got off the bus at Dongsi, it was already dark. She stood excitedly at the intersection waiting for her son. But she waited and waited, and after a long time, her son still didn't come. The old lady hurriedly asked a policeman for directions.

　　"Old lady, where are you going in Haidian?" the policeman asked.

　　This question stumped the old lady, as Haidian was divided into many streets, and she couldn't figure it out.

　　"Don't worry, old lady, where does your son work?" the policeman asked.

　　"He's a bricklayer."

　　"Which organization does he work for?"

　　"What organization?" The old lady didn't understand.

　　"What's your son's name?"

　　"Wang Junchen."

　　"Okay, old lady, don't worry, it's good to know his name, we can help you find him." He gave another policeman some instructions and helped the old lady to the trolleybus dispatch office to make a phone call.

　　The policeman calmly called the Huguosi police station. In just a few minutes, the phone call came back. They said that the Public Security Bureau had already found out where her son worked. Wang Junchen was a worker in the Fourth Work Zone of the Third Construction Company in Haidian District.

　　"How did you find him? So fast?" The old lady didn't believe it.

　　The old lady went to the Huguosi police station and saw that the policeman was calling the construction site, but after dialing for a long time, no one answered. The policeman looked at his watch, "Yes! It's already eleven o'clock, and no one is in the office." Now there was no way to send the old lady, as the public buses had already stopped running.

　　So the policeman hired a pedicab and took the old lady to a hotel.

　　The next day, he hired another pedicab and took the old lady home.

　　Wang Junchen searched for his mother in the city all day and returned dejectedly. Unexpectedly, he saw his mother sitting on the kang when he entered the house.

　　His mother smiled and told him about her experience. In the end, she said: "The people's police are so good, otherwise how could I have found you so quickly!"

　　老太太的感激
　　傅冬  金城
    从武清来的汽车，过去好几辆了，下来不少人就是不见母亲的影子，建筑工人王俊臣心里好生着急。
    他想，原先说的好好的，我在这东四车站等，怎么老不来？莫非是老人家忘了下车，一直坐到终点站王府车站了？急忙赶去，到了那里，还是不见人影。这是怎么回事？王俊臣想，她是不是去动物园了？我以前告诉过她，坐汽车到北京东四车站后，可下来换无轨电车去动物园，到那儿，再转三十二路汽车去海淀。可是糟糕的是没告诉她老人家住在海淀那条街，门牌多少号。也许她老人家记住动物园几个字儿了？他匆匆跑去，又扑了个空。把他急的浑身是汗。
    他迷迷糊糊回到家里，已经夜里十一点。院里的人听了也很着急，大伙拿着灯到外面找，找了半天，还是没结果。这一夜，一家人谁也没合眼。
    第二天一大早，全家出动，分头去找。大儿子去颐和园车站，二儿子去北京大学车站，王俊臣自己去王府车站。大伙又忙了一天，还是什么也没有。
    老太太到那儿去了呢？2月23日那天她是来北京了。她在东四下车的时候，天已黑了。她兴冲冲地站在十字路口上等儿子。可是等呀等呀，什么功夫了，还不见儿子来。老太太急忙找民警问路。
    “老太太，你去海淀什么地方？”民警问。
    这句话把老太太给问住了，海淀里面还分好些街，她弄不清。
    “老太太别急，你儿子在那儿作事？”民警问。
    “是个瓦工。”
    “在那个机关作事？”
    “什么机关？”老太太不明白。
    “你儿子叫什么？”
    “王俊臣。”
    “好，老太太，你别急，知道名字就好办，我们能帮你查出来。”他给另一位民警交代了交代工作，就扶着老太太去电车调度室打电话。
    民警不慌不忙地给护国寺派出所挂了个电话，只几分钟，那边电话就回来了。说公安局已查到了她儿子的工作地点，王俊臣是海淀区第三建筑公司第四工区的工人。
    “怎么查到了？这么快？”老太太不相信。
    老太太到护国寺派出所见民警正给工地打电话，摇了半天没人接。民警看了看表，是呀！已经十一点了，办公室没人了。现在要送老太太也没法送了，公共汽车早收车了。
    于是民警雇了个三轮车，把老太太送到旅馆。
    第二天又给雇了三轮，把老太太送到家。
    王俊臣在城里找了一天母亲没找到，垂头丧气地走回来。那知道一进门见母亲坐在炕上。
    母亲笑嘻嘻地把自己的遭遇说了一遍，最后她说：人民警察可太好啦，不然我那里能这么快找到你！
