Under the American Shadow in Taiwan
The U.S. Establishes Huge "Military Aid" and "Economic Aid" Organizations in Taiwan
Enslaving the Chiang Army and Carrying Out Economic Plunder

Xinhua News Agency, 23rd - Taipei Dispatch: Under the guise of "military aid" and "economic aid," the United States has established enormous "aid" organizations to carry out its mission of occupying Taiwan and controlling and enslaving the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Since 1951, the United States has given the Chiang Kai-shek clique approximately $800 million in "economic aid" and more than double that amount in "military aid." The United States uses "military aid" to enslave and drive the Chiang army to act as its puppets and cannon fodder. As for the so-called "economic aid," which comes with harsh conditions, it is essentially an investment for American economic plunder of Taiwan. Taiwanese newspapers say that the interest rates on "U.S. Aid" loans are so high that they are equivalent to usury.

The sheer size and detailed division of labor within the two organizations in Taiwan that administer "military aid" and "economic aid" demonstrate the astonishing degree to which the United States controls and enslaves the Chiang Kai-shek clique under the name of "aid."

Within the headquarters of the former U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Taiwan, there were positions such as the Group Leader, Deputy Group Leader, Chief of Staff, Directors of Sections One through Five, Cartographer, Operations Officer, Adjutant General, Judge Advocate, Political Advisor, Provost Marshal, Postal Officer, Finance Officer, and Signal Officer. There were also four massive units: the Taiwan Base Command, the Army Group, the Navy Group, and the Air Force Group. Each group was further divided into several to more than a dozen sections. In total, the MAAG headquarters had approximately sixty departments, sections, groups, and offices. These organizations issued orders to the Chiang army headquarters and the U.S. military advisors stationed in various units of the Chiang army, executing the U.S. mission of controlling and enslaving the Chiang army.

The former U.S. Military Assistance Advisory Group in Taiwan was just one of seventeen U.S. military organizations stationed in Taiwan. It has now merged with the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command to form a supreme command for U.S. forces invading Taiwan.

The organization in charge of "economic aid" is the U.S. International Cooperation Administration (ICA) Taiwan Mission. This American aggression organization, which carries out economic plunder in Taiwan, has more than fifty departments, groups, advisor offices, commissioner offices, and so on. These include various positions such as Executive Officer, Financial Advisor, Economic and Financial Analysis Specialist, Planning Analysis Specialist, Construction Advisor, Fisheries Advisor, Agricultural Vocational Education Specialist, Shipping Specialist, Small Industry Advisor, Coal Mine Geology Specialist, Metal and Non-Metal Geology Specialist, Industrial Management and Distribution Advisor, and so on. It even has a so-called "Overseas Chinese Education Specialist," specifically responsible for the U.S. work of luring Overseas Chinese and using Kuomintang secret agents mixed among the Overseas Chinese to carry out sabotage activities.

This massive "U.S. Aid" organization insidiously extends the suction cups of American economic plunder to all aspects of Taiwan's industry, agriculture, fisheries, transportation, and so on. The Chiang Kai-shek clique's Ministry of Economic Affairs has become a puppet organization, with most of its power controlled by this "U.S. Aid" organization.

### 美国在台湾设立庞大的“军援”“经援”机构  奴役蒋军和进行经济掠夺

    美国阴影笼罩下的台湾
    美国在台湾设立庞大的“军援”“经援”机构
    奴役蒋军和进行经济掠夺
    新华社23日讯　台北消息：在“军事援助”和“经济援助”的名义下，美国设立庞大的“援助”机构，执行侵占台湾和对蒋介石集团控制和奴役的任务。
    从1951年到现在，美国给予蒋介石集团约八亿美元的“经济援助”，以及比“经援”多一倍多的“军事援助”。美国用“军事援助”来奴役和驱使蒋军充当它的傀儡和炮灰。至于附有苛刻条件的所谓“经济援助”，实质上是美国对台湾进行经济掠夺的投资。台湾报纸说，“美援”贷款利息之高，等于放高利贷。
    单从美国在台湾主持“军援”和“经援”的两个机构的庞大和分工的细致，也可以看出美国以“援助”为名对蒋介石集团的控制和奴役到了惊人的程度。
    在原美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团总部内，设有团长、副团长、参谋长、一至五处处长、制图官、作战官、副官长、军法参谋、政治顾问、宪兵司令、邮务官、财务官、信号官等；还设置了台湾基地司令部、陆军组、海军组、空军组等四个庞大的单位，每个组下面分别设置几个到十多个科。合计顾问团总部内，设有六十个左右的部、处、组、科的组织，这些组织分别对蒋军总部和驻在蒋军各部队中的美军顾问发号施令，执行美国对蒋军进行控制和奴役的任务。
    原美国驻台湾军事援助顾问团只是十七个侵台美军机构中的一个，它现在已经和美国台湾防御司令部合并，成立了一个侵台美军的最高司令部。
    主持“经济援助”的机构是美国国际合作署台湾分署。这个执行对台湾经济掠夺的美国侵略机构中，设有五十多个处、组、顾问办公室、专员办公室等。其中的名目繁多，如执行官、金融顾问、经济财政分析专员、计划分析专员、营建顾问、渔业顾问、农业职教专员、航业专员、小型工业顾问、煤矿地质专员、金属及非金属地质专员、工业管理和分配顾问等等。并且还设置所谓“华侨教育专员”，专门负责美国诱骗华侨和利用混迹在华侨中的国民党特务分子进行破坏活动的工作。
    这个庞大的“美援”机构，无孔不入地把美国进行经济掠夺的吸盘，伸展到台湾工业、农业、渔业、交通运输等各个方面。蒋介石集团经济部已经成为一个傀儡机关，大部分权力都被这个“美援”机构所操纵。
