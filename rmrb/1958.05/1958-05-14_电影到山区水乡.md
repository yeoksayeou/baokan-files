　　Movies Reach Mountainous and Watery Regions
    Jiangsu Province's two hundred and eighty rural film projection teams, based on production conditions, and under the unified arrangements of the townships and communes, have sent films to every agricultural cooperative, remote mountainous area, watery region, and coastal fishing and salt-producing area, greatly changing the previous phenomenon of film teams being excessively concentrated in a few towns for screenings. Masses who rarely or never saw movies in the past can now see them.
    In the process of touring and screening, rural film projection teams also delve into townships, communes, and teams to collect information on advanced figures and advanced examples in production, compile them into slides, and publicize them to the broad audience before the screenings.

　　电影到山区水乡
    江苏省二百八十个农村电影放映队，根据生产情况，在乡、社统一安排下，把电影送到每个农业社、偏僻山区、水乡和沿海渔盐区，大大改变了以往电影队过多地集中在少数城镇放映的现象。过去很少看到电影或从未看过电影的群众，现在都能看到电影了。
    农村电影放映队在巡回放映过程中，还深入乡、社、队收集生产中的先进人物，先进事例，编写成幻灯片，在放映前向广大观众进行宣传。
