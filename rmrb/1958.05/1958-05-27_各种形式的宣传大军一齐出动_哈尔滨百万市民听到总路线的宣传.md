Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, 26th—Out of Harbin's total population of 1.6 million, one million people heard the propaganda about the general line for socialist construction on the 25th. This marks the beginning of a massive propaganda campaign throughout the city to promote the general line for construction, as determined by the Harbin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party following the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress.

The 25th was a Sunday, and the secretaries of the District Party Committees, district heads, factory Party committee secretaries, and factory directors of Harbin's nine districts all went deep into residential groups and workshops to promote the general line for socialist construction. Various forms of propaganda forces appeared on the streets, including colorful propaganda trucks. Pingju opera, drama, quyi (folk art forms), crosstalk, and acrobatics performers used artistic performances to tell the audience about the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress and the spirit of the general line for socialist construction.

The general line for socialist construction put forward by the Party has greatly excited the citizens of Harbin. Two elderly women in Anfu Street, Xiangfang District, over the age of fifty, were very happy after hearing the propaganda about the general line and immediately organized a middle-aged women's Yangge dance team of twenty or thirty people to celebrate. Many workers and technicians held discussions on whether their own thinking and work met the requirements of the general line after hearing the propaganda about the general line. In order to better implement the Party's general line, workers at the Harbin No. 1 Tool Factory plan to complete the year's production plan two months ahead of schedule.

The propaganda movement for the general line launched in Harbin on the 25th is only the beginning of a large-scale city-wide campaign. Three thousand reporters, including responsible cadres from the provincial and municipal committees, will go deep into residential groups, factories, schools, and government offices to give reports, requiring one million people in the city to directly hear two to three reports on the general line. At the same time, it was also decided to offer a course on the general line in universities and colleges, and responsible cadres from the provincial and municipal committees are also preparing to lecture at universities. One hundred thousand cadres and intellectuals throughout the city will also study the general line.

    各种形式的宣传大军一齐出动
    哈尔滨百万市民听到总路线的宣传
    新华社哈尔滨26日电　哈尔滨全市一百六十万人口中25日有一百万人听到了关于社会主义建设总路线的宣传。这是中共哈尔滨市委员会在八大二次会议闭幕后，确定在全市范围内开展规模浩大的宣传建设总路线运动的开始。
    25日是星期天，哈尔滨市九个区的中共区委书记、区长、工厂党委书记、厂长，都深入到居民组和车间里宣传社会主义建设总路线。在街头上出现了各种形式的宣传大军，有五彩缤纷的宣传卡车，评剧、话剧、曲艺、相声和杂技的演员们，通过文艺表演，把“八大”二次会议闭幕的消息和社会主义建设总路线的精神告诉了观众。
    党所提出的社会主义建设总路线使哈尔滨市民非常激动。香坊区安抚街有两位年过五十的老太太听了总路线的宣传后，非常高兴，立即组织一个二、三十人的中年妇女秧歌队来庆祝。不少工人和技术人员听了总路线的宣传后，就自己的思想、工作是否合乎总路线的要求进行了座谈。哈尔滨第一工具厂的工人为了更好地贯彻党的总路线，计划要提前两个月完成全年的生产计划。
    哈尔滨市25日展开的宣传总路线运动，仅是全市大规模宣传的开端。包括省、市委负责干部在内的三千名报告员，即将深入到居民组、工厂、学校、机关去作报告，要求全市有一百万人，直接听到二次到三次有关总路线的报告。同时，在大、中学校还决定开总路线这门课程，省、市委负责干部还准备到大学去讲课。全市的十万名干部、知识分子还将进行有关总路线的学习。
