Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
Mass Literacy Campaign Reaches Climax

(Reported by our newspaper) A mass literacy campaign is reaching a climax in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. By mid-March, the number of people enrolled in literacy classes throughout the region had surged from 500,000 at the end of last year to over 900,000, with nearly 500,000 learning the Zhuang language. "Cultural villages," "cultural cooperatives," and "cultural teams" are beginning to emerge in large numbers.

The Rong County Special Zone, where literacy work has progressed relatively quickly, and the Yongning Special Zone, where the Zhuang language is being promoted effectively, have both seen their enrollment numbers approximately double compared to two months ago. In Cangwu County, the 167 Communist Youth League branches are committed to ensuring that all villages shed their illiteracy label and become "cultural branches" around the "May Fourth" Youth Day. During the spring ploughing and production season, the county organized over 50 youth literacy teams, comprising more than 14,000 people, to go deep into construction sites and fields. They used various methods, such as literacy cards, literacy walls, literacy posters, and construction site blackboards, to help the masses learn in the fields and at construction sites.

    广西僮族自治区
    扫盲形成高潮
    本报讯  扫盲高潮正在广西僮族自治区形成。到3月中旬，全区入学人数已由去年年底的五十万人激增到九十多万，其中学僮文的将近五十万。文化乡、文化社、文化队开始成批出现。
    扫盲工作开展较快的容县专区和推行僮文较好的邕宁专区，入学群众都比两月前增加一倍左右。苍梧县的一百六十七个共青团支部，保证在“五四”青年节前后，全乡摘掉文盲帽子变成文化支部。这个县在春耕生产中，组织五十多个青少年扫盲队，共一万四千多人，深入工地、田间，运用识字卡片、识字墙、识字牌、工地黑板报等多种多样形式，帮助群众在田间和工地上学习。
