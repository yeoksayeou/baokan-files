Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch. The National Conference of Cultural Bureau Directors concluded in Beijing on April 30th. On the basis of ideological liberation, this conference summarized the cultural work of the past eight years and clarified the direction and tasks of building a new socialist national culture.

The conference pointed out that with the advent of the great leap forward situation on the economic front, a high tide of the great leap forward in culture and art, as an important component of the cultural revolution, has been formed nationwide. Its basic signs are: the unprecedentedly active amateur cultural activities of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers; large numbers of literary and art workers across the country going to the countryside, factories, and army companies to go deep into the masses and into life; and the full enthusiasm of national literary and art troupes and the broad masses of literary and art workers in creating and performing for workers, peasants, and soldiers, with significant development in literary and artistic creations reflecting real life. The conference believes that the main task facing all cultural and artistic workers is to achieve universal cultural popularization for all the people within a period of ten to fifteen years, while gradually improving on the basis of popularization.

The conference believes that under the leadership of the Party, cultural work has undergone great development and improvement in the past eight years; it has always served the workers, peasants, and soldiers and is basically adapted to the economic base; in cultural work, politics has basically taken command; this is the main aspect. However, dogmatism and right-leaning conservative thinking still exist in the leadership work of cultural departments. Within the cultural ranks, bourgeois ideology and its revisionist influence as a bourgeois trend of thought are still quite serious. This has resulted in the shortcomings of culture being divorced from politics, from the masses, and from reality. Therefore, the struggle between two roads and two methods must continue in cultural work.

The conference pointed out that the decisive victory of the anti-Rightist struggle in literary and art circles has opened up broad avenues for the development of socialist cultural undertakings. The "Huaihai Campaign" has been fought, but the struggle between two roads in literary and art circles is not over. The bourgeois revisionist road in cultural work is mainly manifested in emphasizing "art for art's sake," opposing art serving politics, and opposing the Communist Party's leadership over literary and art work. Literary and art workers must fully recognize the long-term and complex nature of the struggle between two roads in the cultural world and constantly maintain due vigilance. Cultural administrative departments must vigorously strengthen political and ideological work. The view that "cultural administrative departments do not manage ideology, but only manage administrative measures" is completely wrong and must be resolutely corrected.

The conference pointed out that right-leaning conservative thinking and dogmatism in cultural work are mainly manifested in not starting from the 600 million population, not being closely integrated with politics and reality, neglecting popularization, and focusing on improvement behind closed doors; valuing the ancient over the present, valuing the foreign over the domestic; not respecting the leadership of local Party committees, emphasizing "vertical lines" over "local blocks," etc. All of these have greatly affected the development of the masses' enthusiasm and creativity, forming the "less, slower, worse, and more expensive" phenomenon in cultural work. In order to "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results" in building socialist culture, it is necessary to "put politics in command" and resolutely implement the policy of culture and art serving socialist politics and economics; adhere to the mass line; continue to implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," correctly resolve the relationship between "ancient and modern" and "Chinese and foreign" in cultural work, discard the old and bring forth the new, so that "the ancient serves the present" and "the foreign serves China," vigorously promote national and folk art forms; establish a proletarian cultural force that is both red and expert; run cultural undertakings diligently and thriftily; rely on local Party committees and cooperate with all relevant departments. The conference pointed out that these six points are the most basic experiences and lessons of cultural work in recent years.

The conference pointed out that current cultural work should focus on popularization, mobilize all positive factors, and achieve universal cultural popularization within ten to fifteen years, while gradually improving on the basis of popularization. It is necessary to vigorously develop cultural and artistic undertakings run by the masses themselves and develop amateur literary and artistic creations by the masses. Literary and art experts and the broad masses of literary and art workers should go deep into the workers, peasants, and soldiers and dedicate their best works to them; at the same time, they should be good at learning from the workers, peasants, and soldiers, drawing nourishment from them, and concentrating and improving the wisdom and creativity of the masses. Cultural undertakings in minority areas should also focus on popularization and vigorously develop.

On the last day of the conference, Qian Junrui, Vice Minister of Culture, delivered a summary report.

Zhou Yang, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting. Zhou Yang pointed out that the great leap forward in culture has two aspects: the leap forward in undertakings and the leap forward in ideology. The leap forward in undertakings must be in line with economic development and adapted to the state of economic development; the ideological leap forward should be at the forefront of class struggle and the struggle for production, and ideology must leap forward in the direction of communism. Literary and artistic works should reflect the current great achievements in the great leap forward in production, express the changes in the relationships between people in the labor process, and the upsurge of the socialist spirit. When talking about the struggle between two roads and two methods, Zhou Yang pointed out that the struggle between two roads in socialist literary and artistic work mainly solves the question of whether or not literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. On this issue, it is necessary to oppose bourgeois revisionist ideas; the struggle between two methods mainly solves the question of how literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. On this issue, it is necessary to overcome dogmatism and empiricism. The struggle between two methods is both different from and related to the struggle between two roads. The struggle between two methods often reflects the struggle between two roads in many occasions, which shows the serious significance of carrying out the struggle between two methods. Zhou Yang also said that in order to realize the socialist construction line of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in literary and art work, the important issue is to solve the relationship between the popularization and improvement of literature and art. The fundamental policy of literature and art must be to focus on popularization and correctly combine popularization with improvement. From an ideological point of view, the key to correctly handling the issue of popularization and improvement of literature and art lies in the combination of literary and art workers with the workers and peasants, and in the ideological remolding of literary and art workers. The ideas of the workers, peasants, and soldiers should be used to remold the ideas of writers and artists; the creation of the masses should be used to enrich the creation of experts. Zhou Yang said that high and low must be based on class and national standards, and works must first have the style of the working class and the nation. Works that can truly reflect the lives, thoughts, and emotions of the working class today and have a national style are high-level, otherwise they are low-level. To change the style of works is by no means a matter for a few experts. It is first necessary to vigorously develop mass cultural movements, realize the ideological liberation of the masses, and at the same time continue to develop mutual discussions and mutual competitions in literature and art. To do a good job in cultural and artistic work, it is necessary to have a team of literary and art experts who are closely connected with the masses and are both red and expert.

The meeting also discussed the main points of the 1958-1962 National Cultural Work Development Plan and schemes for improving the management system of cultural work, which are to be submitted to the State Council for approval before implementation. (Attached picture)

Workers' wisdom is countless,
Red fruits grow on the Clever Plan Tree,
Production tasks are sure to be exceeded."

### 文化艺术工作者必须认真改造自己  走在文化革命的前列  全国文化厅局长会议强调坚持两条道路的斗争

    文化艺术工作者必须认真改造自己
    走在文化革命的前列
    全国文化厅局长会议强调坚持两条道路的斗争
    新华社7日讯　全国文化厅（局）长会议4月30日在北京闭幕。这次会议在思想解放的基础上，总结了八年来的文化工作，明确了建设社会主义的民族的新文化的方针和任务。
    会议指出，随着经济战线上大跃进形势的到来，作为文化革命重要组成部分的文化艺术大跃进的高潮已经在全国范围内形成。它的基本标志是，工农兵广大劳动群众的业余文化活动空前活跃；全国文艺工作者大批下乡、下厂、下连队，深入群众，深入生活；全国文艺团体和广大文艺工作者干劲十足地为工农兵创作和演出，反映现实生活的文艺创作有了很大发展。会议认为，摆在全体文化艺术工作者面前的主要任务是，在十年到十五年的时期中，实现全民的文化大普及，同时在普及基础上逐步提高。
    会议认为，八年来，文化工作在党的领导下有了很大的发展和提高；它一直是为工农兵服务并基本上同经济基础相适应；在文化工作中，政治是基本上挂了帅的；这是主要方面。但是在文化部门的领导工作中还存在着教条主义和右倾保守思想。在文化队伍中，资产阶级思想和它作为资产阶级思潮的修正主义影响还相当严重。这就产生了文化脱离政治、脱离群众、脱离实际的缺点，因此在文化工作中必须继续进行两条道路和两种方法的斗争。
    会议指出，文艺界反右派斗争的决定性胜利，为社会主义文化事业开辟了广阔的发展道路。“淮海战役”是打过了，但是文艺界两条道路的斗争并没有结束。文化工作中的资产阶级修正主义道路主要表现在强调“为文艺而文艺”，反对文艺为政治服务；反对共产党对文艺工作的领导等方面。文艺工作者必须充分认识文化界两条道路斗争的长期性和复杂性，经常保持着应有的警惕。文化行政部门必须大力加强政治思想工作，所谓“文化行政部门不管思想，只管行政措施”的看法是完全错误的，必须坚决加以纠正。
    会议指出，文化工作中的右倾保守思想和教条主义主要表现在不从六亿人口出发，同政治和实际结合得不够密切，轻视普及，关门提高；厚古薄今、重外轻中；不尊重地方党委的领导，重“条条”轻“块块”等。这些都大大影响了群众积极性、创造性的发扬，形成了文化工作中的“少慢差费”。为了“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省”地建设社会主义文化，就必须“政治挂帅”，坚决贯彻文化艺术为社会主义的政治和经济服务的方针；坚持走群众路线；继续贯彻“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，正确解决文化工作中“古与今”、“中与外”的关系问题，推陈出新，使“古为今用”、“外为中用”，大力发扬民族民间的文艺形式；建立又红又专的无产阶级文化队伍；勤俭办文化事业；依靠地方党委并同各有关部门协作。会议指出，这六条纲是几年来文化工作中最基本的经验教训。
    会议指出，当前文化工作应以普及为主，要调动各方面的积极因素，在十年到十五年内实现文化大普及，在普及基础上逐步提高。必须大力发展群众自办的文化艺术事业，发展群众业余文艺创作。文艺专家和广大文艺工作者应当深入工农兵，把最好的作品献给他们；同时应善于向工农兵学习，从他们那里取得养料，并把群众的智慧和创造集中起来，加以提高。少数民族地区的文化事业也应以普及为主，大力发展。
    在会议的最后一天，文化部副部长钱俊瑞作了总结报告。
    中共中央宣传部副部长周扬到会讲了话。周扬指出，文化大跃进有事业跃进和思想跃进两个方面。事业的跃进必须配合经济的发展，同经济的发展状况相适应；思想跃进则应当走在阶级斗争和生产斗争的最前面，思想须循着共产主义的方向跃进。文艺作品应当反映当前生产大跃进中的丰功伟绩，表现人们在劳动过程中相互关系的变化和社会主义精神的高涨。周扬在谈到两条道路、两种方法的斗争时指出，社会主义文艺工作中两条道路的斗争主要是解决文艺要不要为工农兵的问题，在这个问题上必须反对资产阶级的修正主义思想；两种方法的斗争，主要是解决文艺如何为工农兵的问题，在这个问题上，要克服教条主义和经验主义。两种方法的斗争同两条道路的斗争既有区别又互相联系，两种方法的斗争在许多场合常常反映着两条道路的斗争，这说明进行两种方法的斗争的严重意义。周扬还说，在文艺工作中实现多快好省的社会主义建设路线，重要的问题是要解决文艺的普及与提高的关系问题。文艺的根本方针必须是普及为主，普及与提高正确结合。从思想的角度说，正确处理文艺的普及与提高问题的关键在于文艺工作者和工农群众相结合，在于文艺工作者的思想改造。应当用工农群众的思想改造文艺家的思想；用群众的创作丰富专家的创作。周扬说，高与低必须按照阶级的、民族的标准，作品必须首先有工人阶级的、民族的风格。作品能真实地反映今天劳动阶级的生活思想和情感、有民族的风格就是高的，否则就是低级的。要想改变作品的风格，绝不是少数专家的事，必须首先大力开展群众文化运动，实现群众的思想解放，同时继续发展文艺上的互相讨论和互相竞赛。要做好文化艺术工作，必须有一支密切联系群众的又红又专的文艺专家的队伍。
    会上还讨论了1958—1962年全国文化工作发展规划要点以及改进文化工作的管理体制等方案，准备提请国务院批准后执行。（附图片）
