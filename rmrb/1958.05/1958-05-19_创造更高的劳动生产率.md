　　Creating Higher Labor Productivity
　　Zhang Chao, Secretary of the Jiaozuo Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Henan Province

    The Jiaozuo Coal Mine has launched a comprehensive Great Leap Forward centered on increasing labor productivity. The labor productivity in the first quarter of this year has reached 1.924 tons, an increase of more than 50% compared with the average efficiency of the First Five-Year Plan. This year, without increasing a single worker, it can produce 700,000 tons more coal than last year. According to the figures released by the Ministry of Coal Industry, this is the highest production level in the country, and it is also one of the units with a relatively large increase; the cost per ton of coal can be reduced to 6.8 yuan, and the profits turned over to the state will exceed any previous year. The miners have made and will make greater contributions. This is the result of rectifying and improving the relations between people in production, improving business management, initially carrying out the technical innovation movement, and closely integrating political and ideological work with economic work. This is a good start.

    Establishing New Socialist Relations

    The change of ownership has created conditions for creating higher labor productivity, but our managers and mental workers still have some remnants of the Kuomintang style and bureaucratic airs, and there is still a certain distance between them and the masses. They are not easily trusted by the masses, thus hindering some workers and peasants from treating socialist labor with the attitude of being masters of the country and enterprises. Indeed, in each major airing and contending during the enterprise rectification, a considerable number of big-character posters raised the issue of the relationship between people in production. Workers said that cadres are: "Sitting in the office, acting like a big master, taking a walk in the well, earning two yuan and fifty cents." This fully reflects the lack of coordination in the relationship and portrays our bureaucratic style. In the past, each rectification and reform repeatedly conducted inspections. Although the leading cadres admitted their mistakes, they could not make up their minds. Some were afraid that workers would not be willing if they went down to work, some said they could not stand the physical labor, and others said they were a little "shy." In a word, the idea of labor being glorious and workers being equal has not been fully established. Under this circumstance, on the one hand, we launched a debate on this idea; on the other hand, the leaders took the lead in going down to work; and finally, they left the office in batches and shifts, followed the shifts to work, and led production in production. Li Feng, the mine director, truly realized the correctness of the masses' opinions in production and decided to change the old mining method to the new mining method. The coal recovery rate increased by more than 30%, and the effect was very good. Grassroots cadres carried pliers and tools to handle accidents and solve problems in production. Their slogan is "Be a pliers worker, be an electrician, master the technology to be a good manager." The cadres changed, and the workers were happy, beating gongs and drums to send good news, and the cadres wore red flowers. Cadres at all levels adhered to the three-shift system, did not go home at night, and if it was not convenient on the well, they stayed on duty in the well. The phenomenon that no one was there to handle problems when someone was producing at night was changed, and the situation that less coal was produced in the night shift was also changed, which greatly increased the coal production. This approach has also set a new example for handling emergency accidents. March 23rd was such a terrible day. The Zhongmacun well suddenly flooded with more than one hundred tons of water per minute. In just over two hours, the entire well was submerged. The three or four hundred workers in the well were in a panic, at a loss, and some were still working in the distance, not knowing anything. It happened that the Party Secretary and the Director were working in the well. When the water was too high to resist, they called on Party members to save people first and then go to the well. They ran around shouting, and in more than twenty minutes, everyone was evacuated to the well. In the most urgent moment, they two escaped the danger at the end. The masses reflected: The Communist Party saves lives, rectification is a good thing, thanks to the Secretary and the Director being in the well, otherwise even the greatest hero would not survive. Indeed, if an accident had occurred like in the past, the lower level would report to the upper level, but the upper level would not understand the situation and could not make a decision. Delaying the time would cause a major disaster with dozens or hundreds of lives. We have had this lesson. The eradication of the remnants of this old production relationship and the establishment of a new socialist relationship were produced under the circumstances of repeated criticism, self-criticism, and greatly improved ideological awareness during the rectification. Each movement started from the leaders, with cadres taking the lead, and at the same time, it drove the ideological movement of the workers and masses. Criticism and self-criticism were also widely and deeply carried out among the workers and masses against the four "-isms" (liberalism, departmentalism, equalitarianism, individualism) and half-heartedness (half-hearted towards production tasks). After criticism, some handed over extra tools and supplies, some exposed false reports and embezzlement of tools and supplies, and the phenomena of absenteeism and violation of labor discipline were greatly reduced. Many people said: "I have done something wrong, I am sorry to the Communist Party. I am the master, but I am not doing things properly." It was universally recognized that none of the four "-isms" had as much energy as one "-ism", and half-heartedness was not as dedicated as one heart. They said: "The spirit is smooth, the energy is sufficient, no need to mention more or less money, we will not hesitate to shed blood." This is how great the spirit of the awakened working class is. Last year, the average daily output was more than 6,000 tons, with the same number of people. This year, it has increased to more than 9,000 tons. The Liu Zhong coal mining team of the 39th well achieved an efficiency of more than 50 tons per worker, creating the highest record in the country. It is indeed not a simple thing for one person to mine 100,000 catties of coal in eight hours. Countless facts fully prove that revolutionary drive is a huge creative force.

    A New Stage in Administrative Management Has Begun

    Production management is a complex organizational work. The first thing is to organize all the labor force and rationally organize labor. The phenomenon of a large organization and overstaffing was severely criticized in the rectification. The production worker efficiency was very high, while the overall efficiency was very low, which was obviously a very unreasonable phenomenon, and the workers were very dissatisfied. However, the leading cadres always could not figure it out. They were afraid that changing the organization would not be in line with the upper level, and reducing personnel would not be able to complete the work; the director was afraid that no one would write things without a secretary, and the section chief was afraid that specific work could not be done without clerks. In a word, they were afraid of the upper level, afraid of doing things, but not afraid of the lower level, not afraid of affecting production. We adopted the method of mass discussion, everyone setting the number of personnel, merging institutions, discussing rules and regulations, and combining them with starting work together and helping each other. In a very short time, the bureau and mine levels canceled and merged 50% of the departments and offices, and transferred more than 500 cadres to lower levels. At the same time, debates on rectifying labor organization were carried out among the workers, and various methods of combining operations and bringing new with old were used. Nearly 600 auxiliary workers were reduced, so more than 1,000 people were put into direct production, which increased production, of course, greatly improving efficiency and reducing management costs; Secondly, the old problem of interruption and disconnection in the production process, which has always been a source of dissatisfaction for workers and distress for cadres, was solved, strongly supporting advanced units. From an old backward dragging advanced imbalance, we have embarked on a new stage of large-scale balanced and regular circular operation in the entire mine. We started by setting an example in our experimental mine, Li Feng. Their two working faces have always been running 28 to 30 regular cycles for several months. 90% of the teams can complete the task, and a new situation of four highs (high output, high efficiency, high tunneling speed, high mechanical utilization rate), two lows (low ash content, low cost), and one less (fewer work-related accidents) has emerged. The efficiency has increased by more than 20% compared with the same period last year, approaching the level of two tons per worker. They specifically organized a mass thematic discussion of large-scale airing, contending, and debating on this issue, mobilized the masses to put forward more than 2,000 suggestions, and implemented a method of combining division of responsibility and concentrating efforts to tackle weak links, strengthened vehicle maintenance, increased the speed of operation, and implemented the method of determining vehicles based on production and supplying vehicles by the hour. The vehicle operation rate increased by 38%, giving full play to the potential capacity of the vehicles. At the same time, preparatory work was strengthened to ensure that production could have a good succession. In the past, there was often a phenomenon that workers went down the well and had nowhere to work, but now it is gone; Thirdly, in the past, management work was that the leaders had no "soul" and the system was the "commander"; Now administrative staff have begun to pay attention to ideological work, realizing a new method of telling the truth, exchanging information, and handling affairs according to the situation, truly realizing unified leadership. All departments and auxiliary workshops are universally looking to the advanced, balancing to the advanced, and a new atmosphere of large-scale cooperation in the entire mine centered on supporting the service working face production has emerged. The remnants and harms of the functional system have been basically resolved, and a new stage in administrative management has begun since then. This has played an extremely favorable role in promoting increased production and higher labor productivity.

    Mechanization and Automation Are Not Mysterious

    Technical reform is the fundamental link to improve labor productivity, and it is also the inevitable result of each production upsurge. At present, the technical innovation movement centered on coal mining mechanization and mechanical automation has been launched in the Jiaozuo Coal Mine. In recent years, the mechanization of production mines has been greatly developed. The increase in the degree of mechanization is mostly equipped with national investment, but a large part is solved by the enthusiasm and creativity of the staff and masses at a very low cost, which has doubled the labor productivity. In the past, Jingfu had technicians and workers combine the use of terrain slope and existing equipment to create automatic car climbing and automatic sliding at the wellhead, saving 30 car pushers at the wellhead, and the transportation efficiency increased threefold. Comrade Yang Wanli created a self-flowing coal selection table, an automatic loading table, etc., which saved 206 people, and the loading efficiency increased by 6.8 times. Since the beginning of this year, the staff and masses have also greatly improved labor production efficiency after promoting new machines such as combine harvesters, cutting loaders, spiral supports, and metal legless sheds. The efficiency of combine harvester coal mining is more than 12 tons per worker, and the cutting loader can sometimes mine 15 tons. Mechanization is of course advanced, but even more advanced is automation, and great achievements have also been made in this regard. For example, the 100 to 150 horsepower electric pump in Wangfeng well has been automated. When the water is high, it is automatically discharged to the well, and when the water is low, it automatically stops without human management; There are 14 electric winches with 15 to 100 horsepower, 4 endless ropes, and 5 wheels, which have been implemented for long-distance part-time operation; The Zhou wheel machines on the five working faces all use interlocking switches, which saves more than 80 operating workers. It is estimated that the entire coal mine can save 200 artificial workers if it is fully promoted. Practice has proved that mechanization and automation are not so mysterious.

    The promotion of new technologies is also a process of fighting against various wrong ideas. For example, in the use of combine harvesters, we have failed several times due to technical reasons, so the engineering and technical personnel concluded that combine harvesters are not suitable for thick coal seams, and Jiaozuo cannot promote them. Last year, when Xiaomacun tried to use a combine harvester, they regarded the combine harvester as a "match," and the grassroots cadres did not want to use it and dared not say it, and the workers said it was a "stumbling block" and like a "fork." In the upsurge of the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the masses pointed to the direction of mechanization. The Secretary of the Mine Committee and the Director of the Mine made up their minds, launched a debate, and focused on criticizing the idea of ​​opposing the adoption of new technologies to the completion of production tasks, and vigorously opposed the right-leaning conservatism in technology. Some advanced workers requested to modify the Soviet-made Donbass combine harvester to improve efficiency, but many people opposed it, saying: Soviet advanced experience, specifications proved for many years, you are simply joking; Some people also said: Whoever breaks it is responsible. We believe that technology is the creation of practice, and boldly supported the initiatives of advanced workers. The cutting disc of the combine harvester was increased from 1.6 meters to 2 meters, lengthened to 1.3 meters, and the coal loading part was also improved. We resolutely overcame difficulties and used the combine harvester. In the first half of March, it was used in the 402 medium-layer working face, and it continuously ran 15 regular cycles. The efficiency increased from the original average of about 5 tons per worker to 9.5 tons, and the highest reached 11.3 tons. The overall efficiency reached more than 2 tons. Then, the modified cutting loader of Li Feng Mine was put into production, and the small train head made by Wang Feng Mine started running. The tunneling combine harvester and hydraulic coal mining equipment have been put into the trial production process, and a new situation of technological revolution has emerged. As long as we resolutely implement the general policy and general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better and more economic results, we will surely move from victory to victory.

　　创造更高的劳动生产率
　　中共河南省焦作市委书记　张超
    焦作煤矿开展了以提高劳动生产率为中心的全面大跃进，今年第一季度的劳动生产率已经达到一点九二四吨，比第一个五年计划平均效率提高50％以上。今年可以不增加一个工人，较去年多出煤七十万吨。按照煤炭部公布的数字来看，这是全国最高的生产水平，也是提高的比例较大的单位之一；成本每吨煤可以降低到六点八元，上缴国家利润将要超过以往任何的一年；矿工们已经做出了和将要做出更大的贡献，这是经过整风改善了人们在生产中的关系，提高了经营管理，初步开展了技术革新运动，把政治思想工作和经济工作密切结合起来的结果，这是一个良好的开端。
    建立新的社会主义关系
    所有制的改变，为创造更高的劳动生产率创造了条件，但是我们的管理人员和脑力劳动者，还带有某种程度的国民党作风的残余和官气，和群众之间还存在着一定的距离，还不易得到群众的充分信任，因而妨碍了一部分工人和农民用国家和企业主人翁的态度去对待社会主义的劳动。确实是这样的，企业整风中每次大鸣大放，相当大的数量的大字报提出了在生产中人和人的关系的问题，工人说干部是：“坐在办公室，活像个大老爷，下井转一圈，两元五毛钱。”充分地反映了关系的不够协调，刻画了我们的官气歪风。过去每次的整改都反复地进行了检查，领导干部虽然承认了错误，但下不了决心。有的怕下去干不了活工人不愿意，有的说体力受不了，还有的说有点“害羞”。一句话，劳动光荣与工人平等的思想没有完全确立。在这种情况下，我们一方面针对这一思想开展了争论；一方面领导带头下水；最后终于分班分批走出了办公室，跟班劳动，到生产中去领导生产。李封矿长在生产中真正地体会了群众意见的正确，决定改老采为新采，煤的回收率增加了30％多，效果很好。基层干部带上钳子工具，在生产中处理事故，解决问题。他们的口号是“钳工化、电工化，掌握了技术好当家”。干部转变了，工人高兴了，敲锣打鼓送喜报，干部身上戴红花。各级干部坚持了三班制，夜晚不回家，井上不方便，就在井下值班。那种晚上有人生产无人处理问题的现象改变了，那种晚班少出煤的情况也转变了，大大增加了煤的产量。这样的做法给处理紧急的事故也作出了新的榜样。3月23日是那样可怕的一天，中马村井下突然涌出了每分钟一百多吨的大水，两个多小时就全部把井淹没了，井下的三四百工人，有的乱成了一团，无所适从，有的还在远处工作，什么也不知道，正好党委书记和处长在井下办公，在水大无法抵抗的时候，他们号召党员先救人后上井，东奔西喊，在二十多分钟的时间，就全部撤退到井上。在最紧急的时候，他们两个最后脱险，一次大的灾难幸免了，群众反映说：共产党救命人，整风就是好事情，多亏书记、处长在井下，不然天大的好汉也活不成。确实，像过去那样发生了事故，下边向上报告，上边不了解情况，下不了决心，返来复去，耽误了时间，那就会造成几十条或者几百条人命的大灾难，这种教训我们是有过的。这种旧生产关系残余的铲除，新的社会主义关系的建立，是在整风中进行了多次的批判检讨、思想觉悟大大提高的情况下产生的。每次运动都是从领导开始，干部带头，同时也带动了工人群众的思想运动，对四个主义（自由主义、本位主义、平均主义、个人主义）半条心（对生产任务半心半意），在工人群众中同样广泛深入地开展了批评和自我批评，经过批判，有的交出了多余的工具和用品，有的揭发了虚报冒领工具和用具，旷工缺勤违反劳动纪律的现象大大减少。好多人说：“办了亏心事，对不起共产党，本来是主人，办事不正经”。普遍地认识了四个主义没有一个主义劲儿大，半条心没有一条心专。他们说：“气儿顺，劲儿足，钱多钱少不用说，拼命流血咱不惜。”觉悟了的工人阶级气魄就是这样的伟大，去年平均日产六千多吨，还是同样的人数，今年提高到九千多吨。三十九号井刘仲采煤班每工效率达到五十多吨，创造了全国最高的纪录。一个人八小时采出十万斤煤，确实是一件不简单的事情，无数的事实充分地证明了：革命的干劲，就是一种巨大的创造性的力量。
    行政管理工作的新阶段开始了
    生产管理是个复杂的组织工作，首先就是把全部劳动力组织起来合理地组织劳动。机构庞大，人浮于事的现象在整风中受到了严厉的批判。生产工效率很高，而全员效率很低，显然是一种很不合理的现象，工人们很不满意。但是领导干部总是想不通，改变机构怕对不了上边的口，减少人员怕办不完事；处长没有秘书怕没人写东西，科长少了办事员怕具体工作做不了。一句话，怕上边，怕动手，就是不怕下边，不怕影响生产。我们采取了群众讨论、大家定员，合并机构、讨论规章制度与一齐动手、互相结合的方法，在很短的时间，局矿两级取消和合并了50％的科室，下放了五百多名干部。同时工人当中开展了整顿劳动组织的辩论，运用了兼成作业以老带新的各种方法，辅助工缩去了近六百人，这样一千多人投入了直接生产，提高了产量，当然要大大地提高效率，降低管理费用；其次，解决了一直是工人不满、干部苦恼的生产过程的中断和脱节的老问题，有力地支持了先进单位，从一个老的落后拖先进的不平衡，走上了新的大平衡的全矿井正规循环作业的新阶段。开始在我们的试验矿李封做出了榜样，他们两个工作面几个月来总是走二十八至三十个正规循环，90％的队组都能完成任务，出现了四高（产量高、效率高、掘进进度高、机械利用率高）、两低（含?率低、成本低）、一少（工伤事故少）的新局面，效率比去年同期提高20％多，接近每工两吨的水平。他们就这个问题专门组织了大鸣大放大辩论的群众性的专题讨论，发动群众提出建议二千多条，实行了分片负责和集中力量突击薄弱环节相结合的方法，加强了车辆的修理，提高了运转速度，实行了以产定车、和小时供车办法，车的运转率提高了38％，充分发挥了车的潜在能力，同时加强了准备工作，使生产能有良好的接替，过去经常有工人下了井无处可做工的现象，现在没有了；再其次，过去管理工作是领导没“灵魂”、制度当“统帅”；现在行政人员开始注意了思想工作，实现了讲道理互通情报，按情况办事的新的方法，真正实现了统一领导，所有科室和辅助车间一律向先进看齐，向先进平衡，以支持服务工作面生产为中心的全矿井大协作的新气象出现了，职能制的残余和为害基本上解决了，行政管理工作的新阶段，从此开始了。这对于增加生产，提高劳动生产率起了极为有利的推动作用。
    机械化自动化并不神秘
    技术改革是提高劳动生产率的根本环节，也是每次生产高潮所带来的必然结果。目前焦作煤矿以采煤机械化和机械自动化为中心的技术革新运动已开展起来了。几年来生产矿井的机械化已经有了很大发展，这些机械化程度增加，大部是由国家投资而装备起来的，但有很大一部分是由职工群众的积极性和创造性用很少的代价解决了较大的问题，成倍地提高劳动生产率。过去景福有技术员和工人结合利用地形坡度和旧有设备，创造了井口自动爬车和自动滑行，节省了井口全部推动车工三十人，运输效率提高了三倍。工人杨万里同志创造自流选煤台、自动装车台等都节省了二百零六人，装车效率提高了六点八倍。今年以来，职工群众在推行了康拜因、截装机、螺旋支架、金属无脚棚等等新的机械之后，同样大大地提高劳动生产效率。康拜因采煤每工效率十二吨多，截装机有时可以采到十五吨。机械化当然先进，但更先进的还是自动化，这方面也已经取得了很大的成绩。如王封井下一百至一百五十马力的电泵，已经实行了自动化，水大了自动排上井，水下了自动停止，不用人来管理；十五至一百马力的电绞车有十四台，无极绳四部、轮子五部，实行了远距离兼职作业；五个工作面的周轮机全部使用了连锁开关，这几样就节省了八十多个运转工人。估计整个煤矿全部推广，可以省二百多个人工。实践证明，机械化、自动化并不是那样的神秘。
    在推广新技术中同样是与各种错误思想斗争的过程。如使用康拜因，因为技术关系，我们曾几次失败了，因而工程技术人员作个结论说康拜因不适用于厚煤层，焦作不能推广。去年小马村试用康拜因时，把康拜因当成个“配搭”，基层干部不想用也不敢说，工人说它是“绊脚石”、像个“丫”。在跃进的声浪中，群众的劲头指向了机械化这方向，矿委书记和矿长下了决心，开展了辩论，集中地批判了把采用新技术与完成生产任务对立的思想，有力地反对了技术上的右倾保守。一部分是先进的职工要求改装苏联造的顿巴斯型康拜因，以提高效率，但很多人反对说：苏联先进的经验，多少年证明的规格，你们简直是开玩笑；有些人还说：谁坏了谁负责任。我们认为技术是实践的创造，大胆地支持了先进职工的创议，把康拜因割盘由一点六公尺加高到二公尺，加长到一点三公尺，装煤部分也作了改进，坚决克服困难，使用了康拜因，3月上半月在四百零二中层工作面使用，连续走了十五个正规循环，效率由原来平均每工五吨左右，提高到九点五吨，最高达到十一点三吨，全员效率达到两吨以上。接着李封矿改造的截装机投入了生产，王封矿自己造的小火车头开始了运行，掘进康拜因、水力采煤设备已经投入试制的过程，一个新的技术革命的形势已经出现了。只要我们坚决地贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总方针总路线，我们就一定会从胜利走向胜利。
