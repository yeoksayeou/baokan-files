The Spring Water of Jinzhuang Village
Zhang Wenrong

In the high mountains and deep valleys of Fengshan County, Guangxi, there is a mountain village called Jinzhuang Village, inhabited by more than forty families of Yao and Han farmers. Every day around ten o'clock in the morning, when the sun is already halfway up the sky, the village is still not touched by sunlight, as the towering stone mountains block even the sun. There is little land and many stones in the mountains, with no rivers or springs. Every morning, each household sends someone as far as Moli River in the neighboring Ling Le County to fetch water, a round trip of over forty li, climbing three towering mountains, taking up most of the day.

Before liberation, a mountain song like this was popular here: "Born in a poor mountain ravine, each drop of water is like a drop of oil; no rice or water in the pot, every village is filled with sorrow." In the morning, each family, no matter how many people there were, shared half a basin of water to wash their faces, and after washing, the water was saved to feed the cattle. As for washing clothes, that was even more out of the question; they often only washed their clothes once a month. Speaking of washing clothes, there's this story:

One day in November last year, a man was bathing in the Moli River. People coming to the market were very curious, and everyone discussed it. Some suspected he might be fishing, but no one had ever fished in that place before; others said, "Going into the river in winter, he must be crazy!" They shouted to the man, "Hey! What are you doing in the river in winter, fishing or are you crazy!" The man couldn't help but burst out laughing. It turned out that the man was the deputy head of the Jinya District of Fengshan County, and he had been assigned to Jinzhuang last spring to lead production. Since arriving in Jinzhuang, due to the difficulty of obtaining water, he rarely washed clothes, let alone bathed. One day in November last year, he went to the Moli market to buy things and took a large pile of clothes to wash in the Moli River, and then simply took a bath.

One day in December last year, the villagers held a special discussion on how to solve the drinking water problem. Everyone calculated that, in a year, 14,000 labor days were wasted fetching water. If the drinking water problem was solved, these labor days could be used in production, and at least 20,000 jin of corn could be planted more each year. After calculating this, everyone was even more determined to find a water source, but after searching for two days and two nights, no one found a single drop of water. Some villagers said that it was impossible to find spring water in the rocks, unless a fairy descended to earth; others said that even if they searched for ten or eight years and wore out the soles of their feet, they wouldn't find any spring water. But the determination of most villagers to find a water source was as strong as steel. Some villagers had their feet scratched by the steep rocks while climbing mountains, but they still searched everywhere. They said, "We will not give up until we find the spring water." But after searching for several days, there was still no clue. Everyone decided to first visit the elderly and ask them to be consultants. This was a really good idea, and a clue to the spring water was discovered from a 79-year-old woman named Yang Lian.

Old Lady Yang said: "A long time ago, when I was still a child, I heard the old people say that there was spring water behind the current agricultural cooperative office. Later, one year, due to war and chaos, everyone prepared to flee to avoid disaster. Before leaving the village, all the elders of the village discussed burying the spring water well together, so that the bandits would die of thirst in Jinzhuang. So, on the night before the escape, the villagers used large stones to bury the well." Before the old woman finished speaking, several young men ran off to find it. After most of the day of intense work, the spring water well was dug a zhang deeper, and everyone was covered in sweat. Originally, they were full of hope of seeing spring water, but not a single drop of spring water was to be seen. Some people were discouraged and said, "Grandma Yang only heard it from her elders, the spring water may not be here!" It was getting dark, and everyone had to stop work and go home for dinner.

That night, the township and cooperative cadres and the masses specially studied Old Lady Yang Lian's words, believing that when the old people buried the well in the past, they dropped a large stone into the spring water well. Today, they have not yet seen that large stone while digging the soil. If they dig again tomorrow and come across that large stone, the spring water will not escape. The next morning, after digging two chi deeper into the soil, they indeed found a stone as big as a Baxian table. At this moment, everyone jumped up. When the villagers heard the news, they all rushed to see the spring water, and some who were preparing to fetch water from the Moli River didn't go, but took their water buckets to prepare to fetch spring water home.

Countless people surrounded the newly dug well. Everyone leaned down and looked, concentrating on watching the people at the bottom of the well smash the large stone. People thought: Once the stone is smashed, there will be water below. Who knew that after the stone was smashed, there was still no spring water. The people at the bottom of the well touched their heads, and the masses at the edge of the well sighed in unison. At this tense moment, spring water slowly涌 out(poured) out, spring water that had been buried underground for nearly a hundred years涌 out(poured) out, and more and more of it. In less than an hour, the well, which was about one zhang wide, was half full.

Instantly, cheers shook the entire valley, and the sounds of people and songs荡漾(rippled) in the deep valley. Everyone went home to get water buckets to fetch water. Even Ban Dechang, who was blind, came with a pair of water buckets. People asked him, "Why are you here to fetch water too?" He said, "I have lived for dozens of years and have never carried a load of water. This time, I specially came to carry a load of collectivized water home." The township clerk even called the neighboring Gengsha Township to report the good news. From then on, the villagers no longer had to climb high mountains to fetch water from the Moli River. In the past, they didn't dare to put too much soup in their dishes, but now they can drink enough soup. Quarrels over water have also become a thing of the past. In previous years, one-third of the mountain land in Jinzhuang Village was always unplowed at this time of year, but now all the mountain land in the village has been plowed and is ready for spring planting. Several words in the mountain song that people used to sing have been replaced with new words by the people in the mountains:

Collectivization brings a bumper harvest,
We have rice, water, and oil;
Abundant food and clothing make for a good year,
No one in any village is worried.

### 金庄寨的泉水

    金庄寨的泉水
    张文荣
    广西凤山县的高山深谷中，有个山村叫做金庄寨，这个寨子里，住了四十多户瑶、汉族农民。每天早上十点多钟，当太阳已升到半天高时，这个寨子还照不到阳光，高大的石山连太阳也挡住了。山中地少石头多，既无河流也无泉水。每天清早，各户派一个人远至邻县凌乐的磨里河去挑水，往返四十多里，要爬三个高耸入云的大山，一去就得花大半天时间。
    解放前，这里曾流行过这样一首山歌：“苦命生在穷山沟，一滴水如一滴油；锅中无米又无水，山山寨寨人人愁。”早上，每家不管有多少个人都是共用半盆洗脸水，洗完脸，还留那洗脸水来喂牛。至于洗衣服，那就更谈不上了，他们常常隔一个月才洗一次衣服。说到洗衣服，还有这么一个故事：
    去年11月的一天，有一个男人在磨里河里洗澡。来赶圩的人都很奇怪，大家纷纷议论，有的人怀疑可能是摸鱼，可是那个地方从来没有人去摸过鱼；有的说：“冬天下河，看来是发神经病吧！”他们向那男人喊道：“喂！你做什么冬天下河去，是摸鱼还是发神经呢！”那人听了，禁不住哈哈大笑起来。原来那人就是凤山县金牙区副区长，他在去年春天被分配到金庄领导生产。自从到金庄以后，因为用水困难，很少洗衣服，更很少洗澡。去年11月的一天，他去赶磨里圩买东西，顺便带一大堆衣服去磨里河洗，后来索性再洗个澡。
    去年12月的一天，山寨里的人们专门讨论了如何解决饮水的问题。大家算了一年之中，为了挑水，就浪费了一万四千个劳动力，要是把饮水问题解决了，这些劳动力就可用在生产上，一年至少能多种玉米二万斤。把这笔账一算，大家对找水源更有决心了，可是找了两天两夜，谁也没找着一滴水。有些社员说什么石头里能找出泉水，除非有仙人下凡；又说，再找十年八年，跑破脚板皮，也找不出泉水来。但绝大部分社员找水源的决心像钢铁一样坚硬，有些社员因爬山脚板被峻峭的山岩擦伤了，还是到处去寻找。他们说：“找不到泉水，誓不罢休。”可是找了几天，还是一点线索也没有。大家决定先去访问老年人，请老年人当顾问。这一着真要得，就在一位七十九岁的老太太杨莲那里，探出了泉水的线索来了。
    杨老太太说：“很久以前，我还在童年的时候，曾听到老人们说在现在农业社办公室屋后有泉水。后来有一年因为兵荒马乱，大家准备外逃避难，离寨前，全寨父老一齐商量把那泉水井埋掉，好让匪兵在金庄干死。就这样，临逃前夜，寨上的人就用大石头把井埋了”。老人家的话未说完，有几个年青小伙子就拔步飞跑去找去了。经过大半天的紧张劳动，泉水井被挖深了一丈，大家都出了一身大汗，原来满腔希望着看到泉水，可是一滴泉水也看不到，有些人心灰意冷了，说：“杨老奶奶也是听老前辈说的，泉水不一定就在这里！”天黑了，大家只得收工回家吃晚饭。
    这一夜，乡、社干部和群众专门研究杨莲老奶奶的话，认为奶奶说的过去老人埋井时，用一块大石头丢下泉水井去，今天挖土还未见那块大石头，明天再挖，如果碰上那块大石头，泉水就跑不了了。第二天上午，经过再挖二尺深的土，果然发现了一块如八仙桌大的石块，这时大家都跳起来了。寨上的人听到这个消息，都争先恐后地跑来看泉水，有的准备去磨里河挑水的也不去，拿着挑水桶来准备挑泉水回家。
    在新挖水井的周围，拥有无数的人。大家都俯身往下看，聚精会神地看着在井底的人敲碎那块大石头。人们心想：石头敲碎了，下面就是水了。谁知道敲碎了石头，还是不见泉水。井底的人摸摸头，井边的群众都不约而同地叹了一口气。就在这个紧张的时刻，泉水慢慢涌出来了，埋在地下将近一百年的泉水涌上来了，而且越来越多，不到一个钟头，就把这个约一丈宽的水井装了半个井。
    顿时，欢呼声震动了整个山谷，人声、歌声，在深谷里荡漾。大家都回家拿水桶来挑水了，连一个瞎了双眼的班德昌也挑了一对水桶来，人们问他，你做什么也来挑水呢？他说：“我活了几十岁，都没有挑过一担水，这回我特地来挑一担合作化的水回家。”乡文书还打电话到邻乡更沙去报喜讯。山寨的人们从此再不用爬高山去磨里河挑水了。过去煮菜不敢多放一点汤，而现在能喝到足够的汤水了。为用水而闹起架来的事，也成为过去了，往年这个时候，金庄寨的山地总有三分之一未犁，如今全寨的山地已全部犁好，并且已准备好春种。过去人们唱的那首山歌，有好几个字已被山上的人换了新的字眼：
      合作化来得丰收，
      有米有水又有油；
      丰衣足食好年景，
      山山寨寨无人愁。
