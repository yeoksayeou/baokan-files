Reported by our correspondents Li Yunhui and Lü Xinchu: Since May 10th, natural science workers in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have held successive leap forward conferences in various natural science departments, proposing a series of inspiring scientific leap forward plans. These plans not only demonstrate that a new situation will soon emerge in various natural science research institutes in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, but also reflect the great changes in the ideological outlook of the scientific staff in these institutes after a year of rectification. Many scientific workers who were born in the bourgeoisie or deeply influenced by bourgeois ideology have begun to break free from the shackles of various forms of bourgeois individualism, conservatism, blind faith in foreign countries, and emphasis on the "special nature" of science, and have taken a significant leap forward towards socialist ideology.

After the national liberation, increasing the yield of crops has always been an important task during China's economic recovery and construction periods. However, the scientific staff of the Institute of Entomology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were not interested in this important task in the past. In the two years since the establishment of the institute, they have never given the research work on preventing and controlling crop pests the importance it deserves. They have not conducted any research on the problem of rice pests, which currently account for one-third of the country's cultivated land area. At this leap forward conference, the institute proposed plans such as "completing the research on eliminating rice pests in three years, surpassing the Japanese level of rice pest research; and proposing a plan to eliminate locusts within two years." The representative of the institute said: This is the result of the whole institute’s scientific staff earnestly criticizing the past research work that was divorced from the masses, divorced from reality, pursued personal fame and profit, and neglected the needs of national construction after the rectification movement. Now, all the researchers in the institute have made it clear that their research work should focus on promoting the early realization of the National Agricultural Development Program (revised draft). During the "Double Anti" movement, they sent scientists to the rice-producing areas in the south to conduct investigations and studies, and took measures such as establishing a rice pest working group. They are determined to reverse the focus of the institute's research.

Having clarified the principle of scientific research serving production, many leap forward plans proposed by scientific workers are closely related to the needs of national construction. The representative of the Institute of Zoology said: According to their understanding, the main animals that endanger farmland, water conservancy, and grasslands are rodents. Therefore, they regard the study of rodent physiology as one of the main tasks in the coming period. Their other research plans involve methods of developing poultry and other economic animals.

The scientific workers of the Institute of Geology believe that the ongoing Yin Tao (Tao River) project in Gansu Province is a major measure to solve the water source and irrigation problems of the Loess Plateau in Northwest China. Local farmers urgently need water, and the workers participating in the Yin Tao project once proposed: "Where the project goes, the water goes; if the water does not go up the mountain, the people will not go down the mountain." The leap forward plan of the Institute of Geology proposes: "Follow the farmers, work hard for three years, complete the Yin Tao project, and let the flowers of science bloom all over the Loess Plateau." They are determined to directly participate in the Yin Tao project, go up and down the mountains, and provide scientific arguments for carrying out this project in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. Tu Guangchi, a researcher at the Rock and Mineral Room of the institute, said at the leap forward conference: In the past two or three years, during the comprehensive survey of the Qilian Mountains, they opened up fourteen survey routes across the Qilian Mountains, eliminating the blank spots in geological research that had long existed due to a lack of understanding of the Qilian Mountains, trained more than twenty cadres who can work independently, and collected a lot of data, providing experience for further comprehensive surveys of the Kunlun Mountains and other plateaus and remote areas. This fact shows that conducting scientific research in conjunction with national construction can not only meet national needs and serve the people, but also rapidly improve scientific standards and train cadres.

The representative of the Institute of Automation and Remote Control proposed to publish a 100,000-word popular edition of "Automation of Production Processes" on this year's National Day, and to complete a 300,000-word textbook on remote movement science by next year's "July 1st". These leap forward plans show that they have paid attention to popularizing and promoting scientific knowledge and scientific achievements to the production departments; and handing over their knowledge to the broad masses of the people.

After the scientific workers began to break free from the bourgeois individualistic ideology of pursuing fame and profit, they not only paid attention to obeying socialist construction and the needs of the country when formulating leap forward plans. Moreover, when considering how to complete these plans, they also had new perspectives. Many scientific workers mentioned the following factors when talking about why they could propose leap forward plans and how they were confident in completing them: the needs of national construction, the support of the Party and 600 million people, and the cooperation between scientific departments or other departments. The map group of the Institute of Geography has only eight or nine researchers, and one of the main contents of their leap forward plan is: to produce a national atlas within ten years. This is a "talking" map, which will tell people about the underground treasures and above-ground materials in the nearly 10 million square kilometers of the motherland, the distribution and changes of mountains, rivers, and climate, the customs and habits of various places, and the people's construction after liberation. Such a vast atlas does not exist in capitalist countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan. People may ask: How can a few people in the map group complete such a vast project? The representative of the Institute of Geography said: Their consideration for completing the plan is: the map group has now proposed a design plan for the large map. On this basis, they will obtain the cooperation of the Institute of Geology, other relevant research institutes, and the faculty and students of the geography departments of relevant universities. Therefore, they are confident that they can complete the entire plan.

Due to ideological emancipation and the breaking of many superstitions, the young scientific workers of various research institutes were particularly active at the conference. Xu Shaoxie, a young technician at the Institute of Geophysics, reported at the conference: He and two other young people from the institute who had not attended university recently spent ten days making China's first electronically amplified seismograph. The Soviet Union, Britain, the United States, and other countries have already adopted this type of seismograph, which is better and more economical than the old-fashioned seismographs currently used in China. However, when they proposed to trial-produce this instrument half a year ago, they were opposed by their teachers. Now their leap forward plan is: to make the electronic seismograph equipment reach the world level within one year, to be able to amplify seismic waves to millions of times within two years, and to fully automate it within three years. They are fully confident that they can complete these targets on time.

Hua Luogeng, director of the Institute of Mathematics, proposed to catch up with the United States in twelve mathematical problems within ten years; and to completely cover all mathematical problems raised in various aspects such as calculation technology, artificial satellites, and large dams. The young cadres of the partial differential group of the institute put forward more advanced indicators than Hua Luogeng, believing that they can catch up with the United States in the field of partial differential equations within two years.

At the meetings of various departments, scientific workers not only demanded leaps forward themselves, but also motivated and challenged each other. A situation of striving for progress, chain reactions, and blooming everywhere has formed between various scientific research institutes or research groups (rooms).

    让科学之花遍地盛开
    首都自然科学工作者思想解放，业务跃进
    本报讯　记者李蕴辉、吕新初报道：中国科学院北京地区自然科学工作者，5月10日以来，在自然科学各学部连续举行的跃进大会上，提出一系列振奋人心的科学跃进规划。这些规划，不但显示出中国科学院北京地区各自然科学研究所不久即将出现一个崭新的局面；同时，也反映了这些研究所的科学工作人员，经过一年来的整风运动，思想面貌有了很大的变化。许多出身于资产阶级或深受资产阶级思想影响的科学工作者，开始从形形色色的资产阶级个人主义、因循保守、迷信外国，强调科学“特殊论”等束缚中解放出来，向社会主义思想大大地跃进了一步。
    全国解放后，提高农作物的产量，一直是我国经济恢复时期和建设时期的重要任务之一。但是，中国科学院昆虫研究所的科学人员，过去对这项重要任务却不感兴趣。这个所成立以来的两年多时间内，从来没有把防治农作物虫害的研究工作提到应有的重要位置上来。对于目前占全国耕地面积三分之一的水稻虫害防治问题，则根本没有进行研究。这次跃进会上，这个所提出了“三年完成消灭水稻虫害的研究，超过日本水稻虫害研究水平；两年内提出消灭蝗虫的计划”等规划。这个所的代表说：这是经过整风运动后，全所科学工作人员认真地批判了过去研究工作中脱离群众、脱离实际、追求个人名利、忽视国家建设需要的结果。现在，全所研究人员已明确了他们的研究工作应以促进全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）提早实现为中心。“双反”运动期间，他们派遣了科学家到南方稻产区作了调查研究，并且采取了成立水稻虫工作组等措施。决心把所的研究重点扭转过来。
    明确了科学研究工作为生产服务的方针，科学工作者提出的许多跃进规划，都密切联系着国家建设需要。动物研究所的代表说：根据他们的了解，目前危害农田、水利和草原的主要动物，是啮齿动物，因此他们把研究啮齿动物的生理作为今后一个时期的主要工作之一。他们的另一些研究计划则是涉及到发展家禽及其他经济动物的办法等。
    地质研究所的科学工作者认为，甘肃省正在进行的引洮（洮河）工程，是解决西北黄土高原水源和灌溉的重大措施之一，当地农民迫切需要水，参加引洮工程的民工曾经提出：“工程到哪里，水就到哪里，水不上山，人不下山”。地质所的科学工作者跃进计划中就提出：“追随农民，苦战三年，修好引洮工程，使科学之花，开遍黄土高原”。他们决心直接参加到引洮工程中去，上山、下山，从科学方面，提出一些多快好省进行这一工程的论据。这个研究所的岩矿室研究员凃光炽在跃进会上说：过去二、三年内，他们在祁连山综合考察时，开辟了十四条横贯祁连山的考察路线，消灭了地质研究方面长期以来不了解祁连山情况的空白点，培养了二十多个能独立工作的干部，搜集了不少资料，为进一步综合考察昆仑山和其他高原、边远地区提供了经验。这一事实说明：结合国家建设进行科学研究，不但能适应国家需要，为人民服务，还可以迅速地提高科学水平和培养干部。
    自动化和远距离控制研究所的代表提出今年国庆节要出版十万字的“生产过程自动化”普及本，在明年“七一”要完成三十万字的远动学教课书。这些跃进计划，说明他们已经注意到向生产部门普及和推广科学知识和科学成果；把自己的学问交给广大人民。
    科学工作者开始从追求名利的资产阶级个人主义思想中解放出来后，不但在制订跃进计划时，都注意到服从社会主义建设和国家的需要。而且，在考虑如何完成这些计划时，他们也有了新的着眼点。许多科学工作者在谈到为什么能提出跃进计划和如何有信心完成跃进计划时，都提到这样一些因素：国家建设需要，党和六亿人民的支持，科学部门或其他部门之间的协作。地理研究所地图组只有八、九个研究人员，他们的跃进规划中一项主要的内容是：十年内制成国家大地图集。这是一部“能说话”的地图，它将告诉人们：在祖国近千万平方公里领域里的地下宝藏和地上物资，山川、气候的分布和变迁，各地风俗习惯，解放后人民的建设等。像这样的大地图集，英、美、日本等资本主义国家现在都没有。人们会问：这样浩瀚的工程，地图组的几个人怎么能完成呢？地理所的代表说：他们考虑完成计划的根据是：现在地图组已经提出大地图的设计方案，在此基础上，他们将取得地质所、其他有关研究所和有关高等学校的地理系师生的协作。因此，他们有信心全部完成计划。
    由于思想解放，破除了许多迷信，各研究所的青年科学工作者在会上表现得特别活跃。地球物理研究所青年技佐许绍燮在会上报告：他和这个所的另两个没有进过高等学校的青年，不久前用十天的时间制成我国第一座电子放大式地震仪，苏联和英、美等国已经采用这种地震仪，这种地震仪比我国现用的老式地震仪又好又节省。但是，半年以前，他们提出要试制这个仪器的建议时，还曾遭到教师的反对。现在他们的跃进计划是：要使电子地震仪一年内全部设备达到世界水平，两年内能把地震波放大到几百万倍，三年全部自动化。这些指标，他们完全有信心按时完成。
    数学研究所所长华罗庚提出在十二项数学问题上要在十年内赶上美国；并且要把计算技术、人造卫星、大水坝等各方面提出的一切数学问题完全包下来。该所偏微分组的青年干部提出了比华罗庚更先进的指标，认为偏微分方程方面在两年内即可赶上美国。
    各学部会上，科学工作者不但自己要求跃进，还互相带动，互相挑战。各科学研究所或研究组（室）之间，形成了一个力争上游、链锁反应、遍地开花的局面。
