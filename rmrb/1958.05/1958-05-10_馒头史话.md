    A History of Mantou
    Fang Zheng
    Chapter 91 of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms says that after Zhuge Liang captured Meng Huo seven times, the army was returning when it reached the Lu River. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, and a strong wind blew, preventing the troops from crossing. Zhuge Liang asked the reason, and Meng Huo replied, "In the past, evil spirits caused disaster in the country, so forty-nine human heads and black cattle and white sheep were sacrificed to appease them. Naturally, the wind and waves would calm down, and there would be years of good harvest." The locals also said that human heads should be used for sacrifices as before. Zhuge Liang could not bear to kill people, so he ordered the slaughter of cattle and horses, and sculpted the heads into the shape of human heads, called "mantou." That night, mantou were used to replace human heads for sacrifice. The next day, the clouds cleared, and the wind calmed down. Although this story is recorded in Jin Dynasty's Shu Xi's "Bing Fu," Song Dynasty's Gao Cheng's "Shi Wu Ji Yuan," and Qing Dynasty's Kangxi's "Yuan Jian Lei Han," it obviously contains many superstitious elements. The only credible point is that mantou were originally used for sacrifices. Shu Xi said: "At the beginning of the three springs, when yin and yang intersect, mantou are set out for banquets and enjoyment." Chapter 15 of "Dream of the Red Chamber" says: "Originally, this Mantou Nunnery and Shuiyue Nunnery are one entity, because the mantou made in his nunnery are good, it got this nickname." These statements can prove this point. However, mantou were later used to treat guests, and now they have become everyday meals.
    Mantou are also mentioned in the Southern Tang's "Zi Mu Mantou" (Mother-Son Mantou). Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty gave mantou to his ministers every year on his birthday, calling them "Birthday Buns." In ancient times, there were also other names for mantou, such as mantoushe (pronounced dou), mantou, mantou, yuzhu (jade pillar), guanjang (filling), and so on.
    The mantou we eat in the north are divided into two types: qiang mian (kneaded flour) and fa mian (leavened flour). Leavened mantou are made purely from fermented dough, which is loose and easy to digest. Qiang mian mantou are made by combining half leavened dough and half raw dough, which are chewy and filling. Southerners also eat mantou, but generally only as snacks.
    I remember my hometown, Bazhong, Sichuan, where there were people who specialized in selling mantou for a living. They lived in the countryside and carried mantou in a bamboo basket with compartments into the city every morning to sell them at fixed locations. One type of mantou was snow-white and oblong, called "Dazhuzi Zhengmo" (crutch steamed bun). This kind of mantou was filling and especially popular with salt merchants. Salt merchants carried salt from Bazhong to various counties in the south to sell. They carried a very heavy bag of salt and, when tired, would not take it off their shoulders, but would use the T-shaped "dazhuzi" they held in their hands to support the bag of salt, rest, and take out mantou from their arms to eat. After eating, they would drink some water and continue on their way. The people of Bazhong named the mantou after the occupation of those who ate the most mantou, seizing the characteristic of "dazhuzi," giving the mantou a unique local nickname. Another type of mantou was made of black flour, shaped flat with folds, and cost half the price of mantou. Some people liked to eat it very much and gave it a beautiful name, called "Heimian Guangjie" (black flour smooth knot). Mantou merchants also sometimes sold "huoshao mo" (baked bun), which was also made of fermented white flour, with a yellow and crispy outer layer, but a white and soft inner core, which was most popular with farmers from the countryside who came to town for gan chang (fair, called ganji in the north). Strangely enough, in a city as big as Bazhong, there was only one family selling mantou and huoshao mo, without any branches. People regarded making mantou as the highest skill and dared not try it easily, allowing only this one family to have the patent. Now, I imagine that this family must have "made the secret recipe public" and passed it on to everyone.

    馒头史话
    方正
    三国演义第九十一回说诸葛亮七擒孟获后班师回朝，前军来到泸水的时候，忽然阴云密布，狂风大作，兵马渡不过去。诸葛亮问是什么原故，孟获答道：“旧时国中因猖神作祸，用七七四十九颗人头并黑牛白羊祭之，自然风恬浪静，更兼连年丰稔。”土人也说要依旧例，用人头来祭，诸葛亮不忍心杀人，便叫宰杀牛马，和上面塑成人头模样，名叫“馒头”。当夜将馒头代替人头祭祀，到明天，果然云收雾散，风静浪平。这个故事，虽然在晋朝束晣的“饼赋”、宋朝高承撰的“事物纪原”、清朝康熙敕撰的“渊鉴类函”都有记载，但显然含有许多迷信成分。只有一点可信的是馒头最初是用来祭祀的。束晣说：“三春之初，阴阳交至，于时宴享，则馒头宣设。”“红楼梦”第十五回说：“原来这馒头庵和水月庵一势，因他庵里做的馒头好，就起了这个浑号。”这些说法都可以证明这点。不过，馒头后来用来待客，现在成了家常便饭。
    馒头见诸经传的还有南唐的“子母馒头”。宋仁宗每年过生日就遍赐馒头给群臣，叫作“诞日包子”。古时又有馒设（音豆）、曼头、蛮头、玉柱、灌浆等等别名。
    我们在北方吃的馒头有呛面的和发面的两种。发面馒头是纯用发过酵的面作的，吃起来疏松，容易消化；呛面馒头是用一半发面、一半生面合揉作成的，吃起来经嚼，而且耐饿。南方人也吃馒头，不过一般只当点心吃。
    我想起我的家乡四川巴中，从前有专门卖馒头为生的人。他们住在乡下，每天早晨把馒头装在带格的竹背兜里背进城来，在固定的地点出售。那馒头有一种是雪白的，长圆形的，叫做“打拄子蒸馍”。这种馒头吃了经饿，特别受到盐贩子的欢迎。盐贩是由巴中到南部各县去背盐来卖的。他们背着一包盐十分沉重，走累了也不把它卸下肩来，只是用手里拿的那个丁字形的“打拄子”托着盐包，一边休息，一边从怀里取出馒头来吃，吃完了，喝点水，又继续赶路。巴中人就根据吃馒头最多的人的职业，抓住了“打拄子”这个特征，而给馒头起了这样一个富有地方色彩的别名。另有一种馒头是黑面作的，形状为扁平带折，价钱比馒头贱一半。有些人很喜欢吃，给它起了一个美名，叫作“黑面光节”。馒头商人有时也附带卖“火烧馍”，这也是用发酵的白面作的，外层烤得又黄又脆，内瓤却又白又软，最受乡村进城赶场（北方叫赶集）的农民的欢迎。说也奇怪，在巴中那样大的一个县城里，卖馒头、火烧馍的只有一家，并无分号。人们把作馒头当作最高的技术，轻易不敢尝试，只让这一家专利。现在，遥想这一家一定“公开秘方”，传授众人了。
