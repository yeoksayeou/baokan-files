　　Warning to American Interventionists
　　On May 15th, our government issued a statement on the situation in Indonesia, condemning the recent blatant interference and provocation by the United States in Indonesia, and reiterating that our government and people fully support the Indonesian government and people in their struggle to safeguard national sovereignty and oppose imperialist interference. Our government also expressed its readiness to provide assistance to the Indonesian government within its capabilities. In a statement issued on May 14th, the Soviet government also firmly demanded an end to foreign interference and aggression against Indonesia. The Soviet government also stated that the Soviet Union cannot stand idly by in the face of events in the Indonesian region. The statements of China and the Soviet Union demonstrate the determination of the two governments and peoples to safeguard peace in Asia and the world and oppose imperialist aggression. This is a serious warning to American interventionists.
　　As the Indonesian government and people's struggle to maintain independence and unity develops victoriously, the United States' interference in Indonesia's internal affairs is becoming increasingly arrogant. The so-called "government" announced in February this year by the Indonesian rebel group was established under the manipulation and support of the United States. After this, the United States, on the one hand, supplied the rebel group with military aid, and on the other hand, exerted various pressures on the Indonesian government. Dulles openly attacked the Indonesian government for not conforming to the "constitution," which echoed the rebel group's clamor for the Indonesian government to step down. At the same time, the United States even dispatched its Seventh Fleet to demonstrate in the waters near Indonesia. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, manipulated by the United States, also constantly conducts military exercises to intimidate the Indonesian people. Recently, after the collapse of the rebel "government" in central Sumatra, the United States' intervention activities have become even more ferocious. It is constantly transporting light and heavy weapons and military supplies, including fighter jets, to the rebel forces entrenched in North Sulawesi, through Taiwan, our territory occupied by it, and the Philippines, as well as other places close to Indonesian territory. The United States is also directing military personnel and secret agents of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique to directly participate in the activities of the rebel forces. American planes, flown by personnel from the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, taking off from bases in Taiwan and the Philippines, openly intruded into Indonesian airspace and indiscriminately bombed several areas in eastern Indonesia. The United States cannot deny all these facts. The Indonesian government has presented ample evidence. Even the Americans themselves have admitted some of the facts. For example, a United Press International dispatch on May 8th admitted the United States' behavior of supporting the rebel forces with weapons and air force personnel.
　　These intervention activities by the United States in Indonesia are a blatant manifestation of its colonial aggression policy. Since Indonesia's independence, US imperialism has fundamentally refused to recognize the Indonesian people's independent sovereignty, and regarded Indonesia's vast territory as a "power vacuum,"妄想妄想由美国代替过去荷兰殖民者的地位，妄想把印度尼西亚变为美国在亚洲和太平洋的重要侵略基地和殖民地。 Hoping to replace the position of the former Dutch colonialists and turn Indonesia into an important American aggression base and colony in Asia and the Pacific. However, the development of events is exactly the opposite of the United States' fantasies. Indonesia is resolutely moving forward along the path of independence. Especially after the Asian-African Bandung Conference, the Indonesian government insisted on implementing a policy of peace and independence. This not only effectively safeguarded its own national interests, but also made Indonesia appear on the international stage as a force for peace. This is what US imperialism is unwilling to admit. For several years, the main activity of the United States in Indonesia has been to subvert the Indonesian government. When the coups instigated by the United States repeatedly failed, it created and supported an open rebel "government." When the rebel "government" it supported failed, it frantically carried out new interventions. Make trouble—fail—make trouble again, this is the formula for all of the United States' activities in Indonesia. The reason why the United States insists on aggression and interference in Indonesia is because the United States not only wants to overthrow the Indonesian government and change the historical development process of Indonesia, but also wants to drag Indonesia into the Western aggression bloc, and then打击打击和阻挡亚非地区民族独立运动的伟大浪潮。strike and obstruct the great wave of national independence movements in Asia and Africa.
　　It is clear that the United States' blatant interference and aggression in Indonesia has seriously violated Indonesia's independent sovereignty, undermined the basic principles of international law, and already constitutes a threat to peace. The United States directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to come out and act as its thug cannot conceal the United States' crime of interference in the slightest. As everyone knows, the Chiang Kai-shek clique is only a tool in the hands of the United States, and this group of desperadoes is afraid that the world will not be in chaos. The United States' use of the Chiang Kai-shek clique can only further prove that it is playing with fire and burning itself. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the Philippine ruling clique's participation in this intervention activity violates the principles of the Asian-African Bandung Conference and will not be of any benefit to the Philippines itself. The people of Asian and African countries cannot but express serious concern about the situation caused by foreign interference in Indonesia. Government officials in India, Burma, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and public opinion in various countries have unanimously condemned foreign interference in Indonesia's internal affairs and expressed that they cannot allow threats to peace in Asia and Africa.
　　The place where all imperialists in the world suffer misfortune is that they "have no one in their eyes." US imperialism has miscalculated once again. It underestimated the power of the Indonesian people and, even more so, the power of the people of the world. The standing-up Indonesia cannot be intimidated. Recently, the Indonesian Communist Party, the Nahdlatul Ulama, the Indonesian Peace Committee, and other parties and groups, as well as the broad masses of the people, have unanimously expressed their support for the government's opposition to foreign interference and have pledged to carry the struggle to safeguard independence and unity to the end. The Indonesian people are bound to achieve final victory. President Sukarno has warned the United States not to play with fire in Indonesia. Now, the Chinese people, the Soviet people, and the broad masses of the people in Asian and African countries are also issuing the same warning to US imperialism. The peace-loving and justice-loving people of all countries in Asia, Africa, and the world cannot ignore the United States' adventurous behavior that threatens peace. If the United States stubbornly persists, it will surely reap the bitter fruit of its own actions.

### 警告美国干涉者

　　警告美国干涉者
    我国政府于5月15日就印度尼西亚局势发表声明，谴责了美国最近对印度尼西亚的粗暴干涉和挑衅，并重申我国政府和人民完全支持印度尼西亚政府和人民为了维护国家主权、反对帝国主义干涉的斗争。我国政府还表示准备在力所能及的范围内提供印度尼西亚政府所要求的援助。苏联政府在5月14日发表的声明中，也坚决要求停止外国对印度尼西亚的干涉和侵略行动。苏联政府并且表示苏联不能对印度尼西亚地区发生的事件袖手旁观。中苏两国的声明显示了两国政府和人民维护亚洲和世界和平、反对帝国主义侵略的决心。这是对于美国干涉者的严重警告。
    随着印度尼西亚政府和人民维护独立和统一斗争的胜利发展，美国对印度尼西亚内政的干涉是越来越狂妄了。今年2月印度尼西亚叛乱集团宣布的所谓“政府”，就是在美国操纵和支持下成立的。在这以后，美国一方面以军火接济叛乱集团，一方面就对印度尼西亚政府施加种种压力。杜勒斯曾公开攻击印度尼西亚政府不符合“宪法”，这与叛乱集团要印度尼西亚政府下台的叫嚣如出一辙。同时，美国更出动它的第七舰队，到印度尼西亚附近海面示威。美国所操纵的东南亚条约组织也不断地举行军事演习，恫吓印度尼西亚人民。最近，在中苏门答腊的叛乱“政府”垮台以后，美国的干涉活动更加穷凶极恶。它正源源不绝地把包括战斗机在内的轻重武器和军用物资，通过被它霸占的我国领土台湾和菲律宾以及其他靠近印度尼西亚领土的地方，运送给盘踞在北苏拉威西的叛乱分子。美国并指使台湾蒋介石集团的军事人员和特务人员直接参加叛乱分子的活动。由美国和蒋介石集团分子驾驶的、从台湾和菲律宾基地起飞的美国飞机竟公然侵入印度尼西亚领空，对印度尼西亚东部若干地区滥施轰炸。所有这些事实，美国都是无法抵赖的。印度尼西亚政府已经提出了充分的证据。甚至美国人自己也供认了一些事实。例如，合众社5月8日的电讯就承认了美国以武器和空军人员支援叛乱分子的行为。
    美国对印度尼西亚的这些干涉活动，是它的殖民侵略政策的露骨表现。自从印度尼西亚独立以来，美帝国主义就根本不承认印度尼西亚人民的独立主权，而把印度尼西亚的广阔国土看作是一个“势力真空”，妄想由美国代替过去荷兰殖民者的地位，把印度尼西亚变为美国在亚洲和太平洋的重要侵略基地和殖民地。但是，事情的发展同美国的幻想恰恰相反，印度尼西亚坚决地沿着独立的道路前进。特别是亚非万隆会议以后，印度尼西亚政府坚持执行了和平独立的政策。这不仅有力地维护了自己的民族利益，并且使印度尼西亚成为一支和平力量出现在国际舞台上。这是美帝国主义所不愿承认的。几年以来美国对印度尼西亚的主要活动就是要颠覆印度尼西亚政府。当美国所策动的政变屡次失败以后，它就制造和支持公开的叛乱“政府”。当它所支持的叛乱“政府”失败以后，它就更疯狂进行新的干涉。捣乱——失败——再捣乱，这就是美国对印度尼西亚的全部活动的公式。美国所以要对印度尼西亚坚持侵略和干涉，是因为美国不仅想推翻印度尼西亚政府，改变印度尼西亚的历史发展进程，而且想把印度尼西亚拉进西方侵略集团，进而打击和阻挡亚非地区民族独立运动的伟大浪潮。
    很显然，美国对印度尼西亚的粗暴干涉和侵略活动，严重地侵犯了印度尼西亚的独立主权，破坏了国际法的基本原则，并且已经形成了对和平的威胁。美国指使蒋介石集团出来帮它充当打手，这丝毫也不能掩盖美国的干涉罪行。尽人皆知，蒋介石集团不过是美国手中的工具，而且这一群亡命之徒是唯恐天下不乱的。美国利用蒋介石集团，这只能更加证明它是在玩火自焚。同时，应该指出，菲律宾统治集团参加这种干涉活动，是违反亚非万隆会议的原则的，对于菲律宾自己是不会有任何好处的。亚非各国人民对于外国干涉印度尼西亚所造成的局势，不能不表示严重关切。印度、缅甸、越南民主共和国的政府人士和各国舆论都一致谴责外国对印度尼西亚内政的干涉，表示不能容许威胁亚非的和平。
    世界上一切帝国主义者倒霉的地方，就在于他们“目中无人”。美帝国主义又一次失算了。它低估了印度尼西亚人民的力量，更低估了全世界人民的力量。站起来了的印度尼西亚是吓不倒的。最近，印度尼西亚共产党、伊斯兰教师联合会、印度尼西亚和平委员会和其他党派团体以及广大人民，都一致表示支持政府反对外国干涉，把维护独立和统一的斗争坚持到底。印度尼西亚人民是一定会取得最后胜利的。苏加诺总统已经警告过美国不要在印度尼西亚玩火。现在，中国人民和苏联人民以及亚非各国广大人民也向美帝国主义提出同样的警告。亚非和全世界爱好和平和正义的各国人民对于美国威胁和平的冒险行为不能置之不顾。如果美国一味蛮干下去，它就一定要自食其恶果。
