A Fierce Debate Combining Theory with Practice
Shanghai Institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Clarify that Scientific Research Must Serve Production

(Reported by this newspaper) In the past month and a half, the various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai have conducted a major debate on a series of issues, including whether scientific research must serve the great leap forward in production, whether serving production would hinder the development of theory and the pursuit of international standards, and how to serve production. From academicians of the Academy of Sciences, institute directors, and veteran scientists to young researchers who have just left university, all were involved in this fierce debate.

Many scientists engaged in self-criticism and mutual criticism of the phenomenon of their own and others' research work being divorced from reality, especially from Chinese reality. There were two types of detachment from reality: one was the purely one-sided emphasis on basic theoretical research, liking to find research topics from literature without considering whether the research results could be used in practice. The other situation was that although the research topic came from production practice, the personnel organized were only willing to do theoretical research, and regarding how to further guide practice, they felt it was not their business and ignored it. Tang Yuwei and others, plant physiologists who took rice, wheat, and cotton as research objects, also said that if plant physiologists did not understand and study the new problems brought to plant physiology by the current agricultural great leap forward in striving for high yields, then they would truly be building a car behind closed doors.

Production Practice is the Touchstone of Scientific Theory

In the debate, everyone believed that academic-style research could not meet the needs of the great leap forward in production and the great technological revolution, and did not conform to the principle of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. However, when faced with specific problems, some scientists felt hesitant and doubtful. They said: Serving production can certainly promote production development, but theoretical research and cadre training work will be affected, doesn't this contradict the development of science and the pursuit of advanced international levels? Therefore, some people advocated laying a theoretical foundation in the second five-year plan, and researching some practical problems when there was surplus energy, and only when the foundation was laid and a strong cadre team was trained could they vigorously connect with reality.

Many scientists disagreed with this view. They cited a large number of facts to show that, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, scientific theories have developed and been enriched from practice. Production practice is the source of theory and the touchstone of theory. It is putting the cart before the horse to develop theory away from production practice.

Is there no theoretical value in studying production practice problems? Many people think not. There are indeed many topics in practice that have both practical and theoretical significance, such as acupuncture physiology and labor physiology in physiology, wound healing in experimental biology, hormones in chemistry, and plant growth hormones in plant physiology. Grasping key and fundamental problems from practice can not only promote production, but also extract theories from practice and cultivate a team of scientific cadres who are good at connecting with reality.

They also pointed out that the view that serving production would hinder the development of their own discipline actually exposed that scientists were not familiar with production reality, and that the purpose of their research work was not clear enough. They only thought that conducting scientific research could develop their own discipline, and did not consider that the purpose of conducting theoretical research and developing their own discipline was precisely to push production practice to a higher level and newer fields. Organic chemist Liu Zhujin, pharmacologist Ding Guangsheng and others believe that theoretical research should be targeted, either guiding today's practice or guiding future practice, just as an eagle must be able to catch chickens and a key must be able to open a lock.

In the past, many scientists always believed that having some scientists with very high levels, studying some problems that have not been solved abroad, drawing conclusions, and publishing a few outstanding papers could be considered reaching international standards. In the great debate, many scientists pointed out that this view was one-sided. A country's scientific level cannot but be reflected in the degree of production development and industrialization. Even if there are a few outstanding scientists who find some topics that have not been solved abroad, are far from the needs of the country, and have unclear purposes, and study them behind closed doors, and have achievements and publish a few outstanding papers, it cannot change the poverty and backwardness of the motherland. These scientists believe that the Soviet Union has established a strong scientific team that can independently solve any major scientific and technological problems in the Soviet Union, which is the real achievement of international standards, and it is also the direction of our scientists' efforts. Our country has extremely rich natural resources, and there are many important tasks to be solved in production and construction. Scientists must delve into practice, combine the needs of our country's resources and social production development to carry out scientific research, so that our country's scientific undertakings can take root and grow in their own soil, have their own characteristics, and contribute to the world's scientific treasure trove along this direction.

Many scientists have self-examined and said that for a long time, they have had the idea of ​​emphasizing theory and despising practice. It seems that the more abstract the theory, the more profound it is, and they regard research that solves practical problems as being of a low level. They look down on the creative role of the working masses in the development of science, and do not see that production development is an important driving force for scientific development. These bourgeois academic viewpoints and ideologies have led them onto the road of science for the sake of science.

The Secret of Closed-Door Research: Both Comfortable and Famous

In the great debate, with the deepening of ideological clashes, scientists also found another important reason for the separation of theory from reality, that is, individualistic factors such as personal fame and fortune, personal interests, and so on in scientific thinking. Some scientists have self-examined and said that their choice of research topics and methods is often based on whether they can publish papers first. They are unwilling to do general practical problems, because it is difficult to publish papers even if the results are produced, and they are unwilling to contact or dare to contact major practical problems, because these problems are often comprehensive and not easy to solve. Scientists of the Academy of Sciences have always prided themselves on their high academic level. If they cannot solve practical problems, wouldn't it affect their "prestige"? It is better to close the laboratory and do some research that others are not familiar with. Without external supervision, they can be comfortable, self-admiring, and what's more, such research is easy to publish papers and become famous.

Scientists say that they have very deep feelings for their scientific research work. If this feeling is based on love for socialist cause and starting from the interests of 600 million people, instead of based on individualism, it will inevitably generate great motivation and prompt them to better contribute their strength to the motherland's production and construction.

After the great debate, the vast majority of scientists agreed that they should try their best to grasp the key and fundamental practical problems within the scope of their discipline. For those problems that are not very theoretical but are urgently needed in production, they should also take a positive attitude of support and cooperate closely with production and business departments. The debate also criticized the practice of not wanting to learn and use the existing achievements of advanced countries, but insisting on finding unpopular subjects in order to make a name for themselves. Everyone believed that in the current situation where our country's production and scientific undertakings are relatively backward, without learning from the advanced, we cannot improve our level more quickly and economically. The problem is that learning pays more attention to combining with China's reality, and improving and advancing in learning.

Many scientists also pointed out that while emphasizing serving today's great leap forward in production, we also need to see the future. Exploratory theoretical research must not be ignored, but research on such topics should also be targeted, and it needs to be linked with relevant business departments, and strive to combine with our country's long-term socialist construction plan.

At the joint debate meeting of various research institutes, many scientists pointed out in their speeches that due to different disciplines, there are direct and indirect differences in the way of serving production. It is affirmed that any discipline should and can serve production. The problem lies in whether scientific workers wholeheartedly and try their best to actively strive for it. With the ideological feeling of contributing all their strength to the motherland's production and construction, theoretical research can also be reflected in production practice through tortuous reflection, without such ideological feeling, even if the problems raised in the research production practice can also be studied to the road of detachment from reality.

This great debate was not conducted behind closed doors. During the debate, the scientists successively visited factories, farms, botanical gardens, hospitals, and other sites, and invited cadres from production departments to give them reports and hold symposiums. They were greatly inspired by these activities.

After this great debate, the atmosphere of various research institutes facing reality and cooperating closely has been greatly strengthened. Many research institutes have therefore reconsidered their research work plans. Some scientists have already begun new attempts in their actual work. For example, the Institute of Organic Chemistry has decided to study the latest achievements of the world's dye industry - the structure of reactive dyes, as well as hormones that our country cannot currently produce. The Institute of Physiology plans to participate in some research on acupuncture. The Institute of Experimental Biology has begun experimental research on the artificial reproduction of fish.

At present, all the scientific workers of the various research institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai are further thoroughly criticizing bourgeois individualism on the basis of the great debate, re-establishing and moving towards the goal of being both red and expert.

　　一场理论联系实际的激烈辩论
    科学院上海地区各研究所明确科学研究必须为生产服务
    本报讯　中国科学院上海地区各研究所在最近的一个半月中，就科学研究是否必须为生产大跃进服务、为生产服务是否会妨碍发展理论和追赶国际水平、应当怎样为生产服务等一系列问题进行了一场大辩论。从科学院学部委员、研究所所长、老科学家一直到刚刚离开大学的青年研究人员，都卷入了这场激烈的大争大辩中。
    不少科学家对自己和别人的研究工作脱离实际特别是脱离中国实际的现象展开了自我批评和相互批评。脱离实际的情况有两种，一种是单纯片面地强调基础理论的研究，喜欢从文献中找研究题目，不考虑研究结果能否用于实际。另一种情况是研究题目虽来自生产实践，但组织人员只愿意做理论研究，对于如何进一步指导实践，就认为不是自己的事，不去理会了。以水稻、小麦、棉花为研究对象的植物生理学家汤玉炜等人也说，植物生理家如果不去了解和研究当前农业大跃进中力争丰产带给植物生理学的新问题，那真是闭门造车。
    生产实践是科学  理论的试金石
    在辩论中，大家都认为学院式的研究不能适应生产大跃进、技术大革新的需要，不符合多快好省方针。但是接触到具体问题时，一部分科学家又感到徬徨疑虑。他们说：为生产服务固然能推动生产发展，但是理论研究和干部培养工作都会受到影响，这不是和发展科学、追赶国际先进水平有矛盾吗？因此，有人主张在第二个五年计划内先打好理论基础，有余力时可以研究一些实际问题，等到打好了基础，培养出强大的干部队伍，那时才可以大力联系实际。
    许多科学家不同意这种意见。他们举出大量的事实说明，无论古今中外，科学理论都是从实践中发展和丰富起来的。生产实践是理论的源泉，又是理论的试金石，离开生产实践去发展理论，这是本末倒置。
    研究生产实践问题是不是没有理论价值呢？许多人认为，不是这样。实践中确实存在着不少既有实用价值又有理论意义的题目，例如，生理学中的针灸生理、劳动生理，实验生物学中的创伤愈合，化学中的激素，植物生理学中的植物生长素等等都是。从实践中抓住关键性和基本性的问题，不仅可以推动生产，而且可以从实践中提炼出理论，培养出一批善于联系实际的科学干部队伍。
    他们还指出，认为为生产服务会妨碍本门学科的发展的看法，实际上暴露了科学家不熟悉生产实际，对自己研究工作的目的性也不够明确，只想到进行科学研究可以发展本门学科，没有考虑到进行理论研究，发展本门学科的目的正是为了把生产实践推向更高的水平和更新的领域。有机化学家刘铸晋、药理学家丁光生等人认为，理论研究应该有的放矢，不是指导今天的实践，就是指导将来的实践，正如老鹰一定需要会抓小鸡、钥匙一定要能开锁一样。
    有不少科学家过去总认为，有了一些水平很高的科学家，研究一些国外尚未解决的问题，得出结论，发表几篇杰出的论文，就可以算达到国际水平了。大辩论中，很多科学家都指出这种看法是片面的。一个国家的科学水平，不可能不反映在生产发展和工业化的程度上。即使有了少数几个杰出的科学家，找到一些国外尚未解决的、离本国需要很远、目的性不明确的题目，关起门来研究，有了成就，发表了几篇杰出的论文，也不能改变祖国的贫穷落后。这些科学家认为，苏联已经建立起一支强大的科学队伍，能够独立地解决苏联国内任何重大的科学技术问题，这才是真正的达到了国际水平，也正是我国科学家的努力方向。我国有着极其丰富的天然资源，生产建设中有许多重要任务要解决，科学家必须深入实践，结合我国资源和社会生产发展的需要开展科学研究，使我国的科学事业在自己的土壤中生根茁长，具有自己的特色，沿着这个方向对世界科学宝库作出贡献。
    很多科学家自我检查说，长期来，他们存在着重理论轻实践的思想。似乎理论愈抽象就愈是高深，把解决实际问题的研究当作水平不高。看不起劳动群众在发展科学中的创造作用，没有看到生产发展是科学发展的重要动力。这些资产阶级的学术观点和思想方法，使他们走上了为科学而科学的道路。
    关门研究的秘密　既逍遥自在，又出名得利
    在大辩论中，随着思想交锋的深入发展，科学家们还找出造成理论脱离实际的另一个重要原因，那就是科学思想中的个人名利、个人兴趣等等个人主义因素。有些科学家自我检查说，他们对研究题目和作法的选择，常常是首先考虑到能不能发表论文。对一般实际问题不愿意做，因为做出结果也很难发表论文，而对重大的实际问题也不愿接触，不敢接触，因为这些问题往往是综合性的，解决起来也不容易。科学院的科学家一向以学术水平高自居，碰到实际问题解决不了，岂不影响“威信”。倒不如关起实验室来做一些别人不大熟悉的研究，没有外界的督促，可以逍遥自在，孤芳自赏，更何况这样的研究容易发表论文，出名比较容易。
    科学家们说，他们对自己的科学研究工作是有着十分深厚的感情的，这种感情如果建立在热爱社会主义事业、从六亿人民利益出发的基础上，而不是建立在个人主义的基础上，就必然会产生巨大的动力，促使他们为祖国生产建设更好地贡献自己的力量。
    经过大争大辩，绝大多数科学家都同意，应该尽力抓本门学科范围内关键性和基本性的实际问题。对那些理论意义虽然不是很大而生产中亟需解决的问题，也应采取积极支援的态度，和生产业务部门密切合作。辩论中还批判了那种不愿学习和运用先进国家已有的成就，一定要另找冷门以图一鸣惊人的作法，大家认为在目前我国生产和科学事业都比较落后的情况下，不学习先进，就不能多快好省地提高自己的水平。问题是学习更注意结合中国实际，在学习中提高、前进。
    许多科学家还提出，强调为今天的生产大跃进服务，也需要看到将来。探索性理论性的研究决不能忽视，但是研究这类题目，也应该有的放矢，需要和有关业务部门联系，力求和我国社会主义建设长远规划相结合。
    在各研究所联合举行的大辩论会上，许多科学家在发言中都指出，由于学科不同，为生产服务的方式有直接和间接的不同，肯定说，任何一个学科都应该、而且能够为生产服务，问题在于科学工作者是否全心全意千方百计地主动争取。有着为祖国生产建设贡献出全部力量的思想感情，理论性的研究也能通过曲折反射反应到生产实践中去，没有这样的思想感情，即使是研究生产实践中提出的问题，也可以研究到脱离实际的道路上去。
    这场大辩论并不是关起门来进行的。在辩论过程中，科学家们连续到工厂、农场、植物园、医院等现场参观访问，并邀请生产部门的干部向他们做报告，开座谈会，他们在这些活动中受到很大的启发。
    经过这场大辩论，各研究所面向实际，通力协作的风气大大加强了。许多研究所因此重新考虑了研究工作规划。一些科学家已经在实际工作中开始了新的尝试，例如，有机化学研究所决定研究世界染料工业最新成就——活性染料的结构，以及我国目前还不能生产的激素。生理研究所打算参加针灸方面的一部分研究。实验生物研究所已开始进行了鱼的人工生殖等试验研究。
    目前中国科学院上海地区各研究所的全体科学工作者正在大辩论的基础上，再破再立，进一步彻底批判资产阶级个人主义，向红透专深的目标迈进。
