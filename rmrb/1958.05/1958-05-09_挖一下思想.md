    Digging into Thoughts
    Chen Fang
    A reporter from a certain news organization, before going to the countryside for an interview, first made several requests to the public: one was to provide him with a down comforter; the other was to provide him with a folding bicycle... The reasons were natural: a down comforter is light to carry and comfortable and warm to sleep under; a folding bicycle is convenient to carry, and more importantly, it can reduce walking. And all of this was naturally for work. This happened several years ago, and of course, it was not approved. During the rectification campaign, this old matter was brought up again and classified as "extravagance." But the problem was not solved by this. Because behind this "extravagance" there are thoughts. If the thoughts are not dug out, "extravagance" will be difficult to eradicate, but the double-anti campaign promoted this comrade, and after uncovering the lid of his thoughts, he discovered that he had the idea of "being a guest" when participating in the revolution. Taking himself as a "guest," asking for better treatment naturally didn't seem like a big deal to him.
    Digging out the poisonous sore of "being a guest" from the ideological level is itself a leap forward. The leap forward in work is built on the foundation of ideological leap forward. Some people are still active in examining the "five airs," but are too lazy (or perhaps reluctant) to dig into the roots of their thoughts. Little do they know that if the roots are not removed, the "five airs" still have roots and sources, and will never be swept away. If the "five airs" are not removed, how can we talk about a leap forward?

    挖一下思想
    陈放
    某新闻单位有个记者，在下乡采访以前，先向公家提出了几项要求：一是为他置办鸭绒被；二是为他置办折叠式自行车……理由自然是有的：鸭绒被带着轻便，盖着舒适暖和；折叠自行车带着方便，更重要的是可以少跑路。而这一切自然又都是为了工作。这是几年以前的事，当然也是没有被批准的事。整风期间，这件旧事又被翻腾出来，并且归到了“阔气”那一类里去。但是问题并不因此就解决了。因为在这种“阔气”的后面还有思想。思想不挖，“阔气”总难根除，还是双反促进了这个同志，他在揭开思想的盖子以后，发现了参加革命有“作客”的思想。以“客”自居，要求优厚一些，自然也就觉得不算回事了。
    从思想上挖掉“作客”的毒疮，本身就是个跃进。工作上的跃进，就建立在思想跃进的基础上。有些人对检查五气曾还积极，可是却懒得（也许是舍不得）去挖思想的根子。殊不知根子不除，“五气”还是有本之木，有源之水，总是扫不掉的。五气不除，跃进又从何谈起？
