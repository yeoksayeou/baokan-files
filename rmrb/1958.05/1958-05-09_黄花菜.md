    Daylily

    The daylily is a world-renowned type of edible flower. It is originally the flower of the Hemerocallis plant. Because of its golden color and its use as a common vegetable, it is commonly known as daylily. In ancient times, people called it "xuan cao" (萱草 - hemerocallis). The line "yan de xuan cao (焉得谖草)" in the Book of Songs refers to it. The ancients believed that people with worries and a heavy heart could relieve their sorrow and forget their troubles by planting Hemerocallis in their yards. The "Yang Sheng Lun" (养生论 - On Nourishing Life) by Ji Kang of the Jin Dynasty mentioned "xuan cao wang you (萱草忘忧 - hemerocallis forgets sorrow)". Therefore, it is also called "wang you cao" (忘忧草 - forget-sorrow herb).

    Daylilies can be either cultivated or wild. They bloom in the summer. Fresh daylilies are harvested when they are in bud. Dried daylilies, which are sold in the market, are made by briefly blanching fresh daylilies in boiling water and then drying them. This vegetable is produced throughout China, especially in Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, and Shanxi provinces. The best products are those that are bright yellow, fleshy, dry, free of mold, and do not fall apart after prolonged cooking.

    Daylilies have a high nutritional value. Every 100 grams of dried daylilies contains 344 milligrams of carotene, which is more than alfalfa and carrots. They are also rich in vitamin B and minerals. The content of iron, phosphorus, calcium, and potassium is higher than that of ordinary vegetables. Fresh daylilies contain even more vitamin C.

    There are many ways to eat daylilies. They can be stir-fried with wood ear mushrooms and other ingredients to make vegetarian assorted delicacies. They can also be stir-fried with shredded pork to make braised three-silk dish. In some places, they are stir-fried and eaten alone. In medicine, daylilies also have diuretic, fever-reducing, and nutritious stomach-strengthening effects. (Hong Xi)

    黄花菜
    黄花菜是世界上著名的一种花菜。它本来是萱草开的花，因为花色金黄，又是人们日常吃的蔬菜，所以俗名黄花菜。古时人们叫它谖草，诗经上“焉得谖草”，就是指的它。古人认为，心怀忧愁、思想不开朗的人，如果在院子里亲自种点萱草，可以解愁忘忧，晋朝嵇康养生论里就曾提到“萱草忘忧”，所以又管它叫“忘忧草”。
    黄花菜有种植和野生两种，每年夏季开花。在它结蕾时采取，就是鲜黄花菜。把它先用开水略为泡软，然后晒干，就是市上卖的干黄花菜，这菜在我国南北各地都有出产，尤以江苏、安徽、河南、山西等处为多。产品以色泽黄亮、菜身肥厚、干燥无霉、久煮不烂的为上品。
    黄花菜的营养价值很高，干黄花菜每百克含有344毫克胡萝卜素，超过苜蓿和胡萝卜，维生素乙和矿物质的含量很高；而铁、磷、钙、钾的含量，一般的蔬菜是比不上它的。鲜黄花菜，更含有多量的维生素丙。
    黄花菜的吃法很多，可以和木耳等合炒成素什锦，可以和肉丝合炒成烧三丝，也有的地方单独炒来吃。黄花菜在医疗上也有利尿、除身体烦热及营养健胃等作用。（洪希）
