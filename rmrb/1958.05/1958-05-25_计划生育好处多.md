    Planned Births Have Many Benefits
    Yang Xuan
    Since the widespread promotion of planned births, people have been saying this method is good. However, the other day I heard a sister-in-law say, "Raising children is like herding sheep, one is herding, and several is herding. A thriving family is a good thing, so why deliberately try not to have children?" It's clear that some people still don't quite understand the benefits of planned births.
    Practicing planned births doesn't mean not having children at all, but rather advocating that people use scientific methods to practice contraception and make good birth plans. This is to avoid having too many children, too close together, which affects the health of mothers and children, as well as the work and family life of parents.
    Comparing having children to herding sheep is not quite appropriate. With fewer children, one can take care of them more attentively; with more, one can only be rough, inevitably a little careless. Look at those sisters-in-law who are dragging one, holding one, and pregnant with another; most of them become weak due to the burden of their children. The children also easily get sick and develop bad habits because of a lack of care and education. In addition, more children mean more housework, which will affect work and study. Especially in rural areas, women with many children are often unable to participate in agricultural production. Also, with a larger family population, expenses are greater, and families that are not very wealthy have to worry about life.
    Excessive and rapid population growth is also not good for the country and society. National construction is carried out according to plan, and the result of blindly increasing the population will create difficulties in employment, housing, education... etc. Among the more than 1.1 million households in Beijing, more than 12,000 children were born in April this year alone. If an elementary school averages 300 students, the state will have to build 40 elementary schools for these children in the future. Calculated by general standards, the average cost of building an elementary school for 300 people is 34,000 yuan, and 40 schools will cost 1.36 million yuan. In the future, the state will also have to pay 360,000 yuan in funding for these 12,000 elementary school students each year.
    Having children in a planned way is precisely to ensure that one is born, one lives; if one lives, one grows strong, so that mother and child are healthy, and the family thrives. This is good for the family and for society.

    计划生育好处多
    杨萱
    自从普遍提倡计划生育以来，人们都说这个办法好。可是，前两天我听见一位大嫂说：“养娃好比放羊，一个也是放，几个也是放。人丁兴旺是好事，为啥故意设法不生孩子？”可见有些人还是不大明白计划生育的好处。
    实行计划生育，并不是让人干脆不生孩子，而是提倡人们用科学的方法，实行避孕和作好生育计划。这是免得孩子生的过多、过密，影响母子健康和父母的工作与家庭生活。
    拿生男育女的事同放羊比，可不大恰当。孩子少，可以照顾得经心些；多了，只得大大落落的，免不了有点马虎。你看那些拖一个、抱一个、肚子里还怀一个的大嫂们，大都由于子女牵累，身体变得很弱。孩子也因为缺乏照顾和教育，容易生病和养成一些坏习惯。另外，孩子一多，家务事也多，工作和学习都会受到影响。尤其是在农村的多子女妇女，往往因此不能参加农业生产。还有，家庭人口多了，开支就大，经济不大富裕的家庭，就要为生活犯愁。
    人口增加过多过快，对国家社会也没有好处。国家建设是按计划进行的，盲目增加人口的结果，就会在就业、居住、教育……等方面造成困难。北京市一百一十多万户人家中，今年4月份就生了一万二千多个小孩。如果一所小学平均容纳三百个学生，以后国家就要为这些孩子办四十所小学。以一般标准计算，兴办一所三百人的小学，平均需用三万四千元，四十所就要一百三十六万元。以后国家每年还要为这一万二千个小学生付出三十六万元经费。
    有计划地生孩子，正是为了做到生一个、活一个；活一个，壮一个，使母子健康、人丁兴旺。这样对家庭、对社会都有好处。
