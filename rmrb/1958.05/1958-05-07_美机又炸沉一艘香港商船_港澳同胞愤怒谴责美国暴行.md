Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th: Another Hong Kong merchant ship, the "Morlock," was sunk by U.S. aircraft assisting Indonesian rebels at the port of Donggala, Indonesia.

The "Morlock" was sunk on April 28th along with another Hong Kong merchant ship, the "Feiyan." The General Manager of the Hong Kong Wah Lam Company, the agent for this merchant ship, said that he only received the news yesterday from the Indonesian chartering company. The ship's British captain and thirty-three Hong Kong Chinese sailors are still missing.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th: Compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Macao have been angrily condemning the U.S. aircraft for indiscriminately bombing Hong Kong merchant ships docked in Indonesian ports and slaughtering Chinese sailors.

Li Sheng, Chairman of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, issued a statement saying that the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions is extremely indignant at the lawless crimes of U.S. aircraft.

Gao Zhuoxiong, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, said: "U.S. imperialism's indiscriminate bombing of merchant ships and slaughter of sailors is an unreasonable and inhumane act."

Hong Kong's Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po have published commentaries and special articles in recent days, exposing the various evil activities that the United States has consistently carried out in Asia, and pointing out that these activities threaten the peaceful lives of the Asian people.

Macao compatriots are also very angry about the incident of U.S. aircraft indiscriminately bombing Hong Kong merchant ships and slaughtering Chinese sailors. The Macao Seamen's Union issued a statement saying that this move by the United States fully proves its ferocious and evil face of creating war everywhere. The United States must bear full responsibility for this huge incident of death and disappearance. Liang Pei, Chairman of the Macao Federation of Trade Unions, said that if this atrocity by the U.S.-Chiang Kai-shek elements is not stopped in time, it will inevitably lead to more serious consequences.
