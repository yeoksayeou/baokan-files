Xinhua News Agency, May 30th - The Dutch newspaper "Truth" recently published a statement by the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of the Netherlands, pointing out that the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY), submitted for discussion at the Seventh Congress of the LCY, is clearly contrary to the spirit of the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. The statement said: "Our party agrees with and supports this declaration." Therefore, the Political Bureau of the Dutch Communist Party refused to send a delegation to the LCY Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th - Brussels news: According to a recent report in the Belgian Communist Party's newspaper "Red Flag," after studying the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the leading body of the Belgian Communist Party stated that it particularly disagreed with the assessment of the two military and political blocs.

The Belgian Communist Party believes that the assessment in the draft program actually equates the policies of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries with the policies of the United States and countries that have concluded military and political agreements with the United States. This assessment is completely contrary to the actual situation, does not conform to the principles of Marxism-Leninism at all, and does not help to carry out the struggle for peace.

"Red Flag" also announced the decision of the Belgian Communist Party not to send a delegation to the LCY Congress.

Xinhua News Agency, May 30th - According to TASS, Tel Aviv: In a statement recently issued by the Communist Party of Israel, a study of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, especially the section in Chapter 3 on international issues and Yugoslavia's foreign policy, shows that the draft puts forward a series of arguments that do not conform to the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

The statement stated that the Israeli Communist Party disagrees with the draft program of the LCY and disagrees with the views and arguments that contradict the ideological principles of the international communist movement put forward in the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties of socialist countries. Therefore, the Israeli Communist Party has decided not to send a delegation to the Seventh Congress of the LCY.

    荷比以三国共产党表示
    拥护莫斯科宣言  不同意南共纲领
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社海牙讯：荷兰“真理报”不久前发表的荷兰共产党政治局的公告指出，提交南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会讨论的南共纲领草案，同社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言的精神显然是相违背的。公告说：“我们的党是同意并拥护这个宣言的。”因此，荷共政治局拒绝派代表团出席南共的代表大会。
    新华社30日讯　布鲁塞尔消息：据比利时共产党机关报“红旗报”不久前报道，比共领导机构在研究了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案后，表示特别不能同意其中关于两种军事、政治集团的估计。
    比共认为，纲领草案中的估计实际上是把苏联和其他社会主义国家的政策同美国和与美国缔结军事、政治公约的国家的政策相提并论，这种估计绝对违背了实际情况，丝毫不符合马克思列宁主义的原则，而且无助于开展争取和平的斗争。
    “红旗报”还宣布了比共不派代表团出席南共代表大会的决定。
    新华社30日讯　据塔斯社特拉维夫讯：以色列共产党在不久前发表的声明中说，研究一下南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案、特别是第三章关于国际问题和南斯拉夫对外政策问题的部分，就可以看到草案提出了一系列不符合马克思列宁主义原则和无产阶级国际主义原则的论点。
    声明表示，以共不同意南共纲领草案，不同意与社会主义国家共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言所提出的国际共产主义运动思想原则相矛盾的观点和论点，因此以共决定不派代表团参加南共第七次代表大会。
