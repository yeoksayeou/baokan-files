Xinhua News Agency, May 13th: The French weekly "New France" published on May 8th a summary of an article written by Raymond Guyot, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party, for the May issue of the "Handbook of Communism." The article discussed the French Communist Party's criticism of the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

The article pointed out that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, adopted at the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held at the end of April, has fundamental differences from the French Communist Party's position in its exposition of certain principles and its analysis of the international situation. This program replaces objective and scientific analysis with emotional statements, and deliberately disregards the principled premise of imperialism and socialism in its analysis, thus unprecedentedly confusing right and wrong.

The article continued, the principled errors made by the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in its analysis of the international situation will cause confusion and may bring damage to the international workers' movement. The same error, namely the denial of class contradictions, also causes the same dangerous confusion when it comes to the question of the state, the question of the party's revolutionary struggle, and other issues.

The article concluded that the program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is definitely a source of ideological and political confusion in several of the issues it discusses. Naturally, we cannot ignore this. In many respects, the drafters of the program went too far, even excessively, in order to oppose the declaration of the twelve Communist and Workers' parties adopted in Moscow last November, and apparently to explain why the Yugoslav delegation refused to sign this document, which helped to strengthen the unity of the international communist movement around the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Communist parties in various countries see that the program of the League of Communists is an undeniable revisionist action, and it should be clearly pointed out that this action is aimed at the Soviet Union and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. We regret this very much, especially because the enemies of peace and socialism will not fail to take advantage of it.

    法共中央政治局委员居约著文说
　　南共纲领制造混乱黑白不分
    新华社13日讯　法国“新法兰西”周刊8日摘要刊载了法国共产党中央委员会政治局委员雷蒙·居约为“共产主义手册”5月号写的文章，这篇文章谈到法国共产党对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领的批评。
    文章指出，4月底举行的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会通过的南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领，对于某些原则的阐述和对于国际局势的分析，同法国共产党的立场有根本性的不同。这个纲领是以感情用事的说法来代替客观和科学的分析，并且在分析中故意不顾原则性前提——帝国主义和社会主义，因此是空前的黑白不分。
    文章接着说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟在国际形势的分析上所犯的原则性错误，会造成混乱，并且可能为国际工人运动带来损害。同样的错误，即否认阶级矛盾的错误，在涉及国家问题、党的革命斗争问题和其他问题的时候，也造成同样危险的混乱。
    文章归结说，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的纲领，在它所论述的好几个问题上，肯定是引起意识形态和政治方面的混乱的根源。对此，我们自然不能置之不理。在许多方面，纲领的起草人为了同去年11月在莫斯科通过的十二个共产党和工人党宣言对立，而且显然是为了解释南斯拉夫代表团为什么拒绝在有助于加强团结在苏联和苏联共产党周围的国际共产主义运动的这个文件上签字，他们作得过分了，甚至太过分了。各国共产党看出，共产主义者联盟的纲领是无可否认的修正主义性质的行动，而且应该明白指出，这一行动的矛头是针对着苏联和苏联共产党的。我们对此感到非常遗憾，特别是因为和平和社会主义的敌人们不会不加以利用。
