Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 9th. The Duzhu (Duyun) to Zhu (Guiyang) section of the Guiqian Railway began laying tracks northward from Duyun on the 7th.

The planned date for the opening of the Guiqian Railway to Guiyang has been brought forward repeatedly. Since the beginning of this year, railway workers along the entire line have accelerated the pace of construction. Currently, in the seventy-kilometer section from Duyun to Guiding, most of the twenty tunnels of various sizes have been excavated and are being reinforced with walls and arches. The twelve large and medium-sized bridges are also nearing completion. Now, the road construction workers are shifting from south to north, concentrating on the key projects that have not yet been completed.
