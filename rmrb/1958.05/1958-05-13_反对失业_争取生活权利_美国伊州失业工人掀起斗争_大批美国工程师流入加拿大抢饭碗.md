　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from New York: According to a report by the American "Workers' Weekly" on the 11th, unemployed workers in Illinois, USA, have launched a struggle against unemployment and for the right to live.

　　Representatives of unemployed workers and union members from major cities in the state, a total of 1,500 people, recently held a "Special Labor Conference" in Springfield. The conference unanimously passed an eight-point plan, including demands that the state legislature quickly convene a special session to discuss measures to relieve unemployment, increase unemployment benefits, extend the period for paying unemployment benefits, postpone repayment of installment debts, and reduce sales taxes on food and clothing. After the meeting, the representatives, filled with indignation, marched to the governor's mansion, where they posted slogans on the walls and erected signs on the lawn. The governor was too frightened to show his face.

　　The slogans raised by the unemployed included: "We demand work - build schools, roads, hospitals!" "All God's children need shoes - shoe workers need work!" etc. The slogan of the laid-off tractor factory workers was: "10,000 people are unemployed - 30,000 people are waiting for food!"

　　According to the same issue of "Workers' Weekly," more than 600 unemployed people in Boston (mainly auto workers, textile workers, and shoe workers) also recently marched to the city hall to petition for work and increased unemployment benefits.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch from London: According to a report from Toronto, Canada, published by "The Scotsman" on May 9th, due to the impact of the US economic crisis, a large number of American engineers are flowing into Canada in search of employment, causing serious anxiety among Canadian engineers.

　　"The Scotsman" said, "So many American engineers are flowing into Canada that two groups of Canadian engineers have taken steps to deal with it." Guld, secretary of the Canadian "Association of Consulting Engineers," complained, "American engineers are coming to snatch our rice bowls." The association has appointed a committee to deal with this issue. The Canadian "Professional Engineers Association" has appealed to the government's immigration and labor departments, requesting that measures be taken to deal with this problem.

　　"The Scotsman" pointed out that for many years, many Canadian engineers had been moving to the United States, but now the situation is exactly the opposite. The newspaper said, "Although Canada also has an economic recession, this has not stopped hundreds of Americans who want to cross the border and try their luck." In addition, many Canadian engineers who went to the United States in previous years are also trying their best to return home to find employment.

    反对失业　争取生活权利
　　美国伊州失业工人掀起斗争
    大批美国工程师流入加拿大抢饭碗
    新华社12日讯　纽约消息：据美国“工人周报”11日报道，美国伊利诺斯州失业工人掀起了反对失业、争取生活权利的斗争。
    来自这个州各主要城市的失业工人和工会会员的代表共一千五百人最近在斯普林菲尔德举行了“劳工特别会议”。会上一致通过一项八点方案，包括要求州立法机构迅速召开特别会议讨论救济失业措施、增加失业补助金、延长付给失业补助金的期限、延期偿还分期付款债务、减少食品衣服销售税等。会后，代表们群情激愤地列队走到州长大厦，在那里的墙上贴上了标语，在草地上竖起了标语牌。州长吓得没敢露面。
    失业者提出的口号有：“我们要求工作——建筑学校、道路、医院！”一切上帝的儿女都需要鞋子——制鞋工人需要工作！”等。被解雇了的拖拉机制造厂工人的口号是：“一万人失了业——三万人等着要饭吃！”
    据同一期的“工人周报”报道，波斯顿市六百多名失业者（主要是汽车工人、纺织工人和制鞋工人）也在最近游行到市政府请愿，要求得到工作和增加失业救济金。
    新华社12日讯　伦敦消息：据“苏格兰人报”5 月9日发表的来自加拿大多伦多的报道，由于美国经济危机的影响，大批美国工程师流入加拿大寻找职业，引起了加拿大工程师的严重不安。
    “苏格兰人报”说，“美国工程师流入加拿大的是如此之多，以致加拿大工程师的两个团体已经采取了对付的步骤。”加拿大“顾问工程师协会”书记古耳德抱怨说：“美国工程师正来抢走我们的饭碗”。这个协会已经任命了一个委员会来处理这一问题。加拿大“职业工程师协会”已经向政府移民部门和劳工部门发出呼吁，要求设法对付这一问题。
    “苏格兰人报”指出，好些年来一向是有许多加拿大工程师移居到美国去的，如今情况却正好相反了。报纸说，“尽管加拿大也有经济衰退，但是这并没有使数以百计的想过边境来试试运气的美国人止步。”此外，许多在前几年到美国去的加拿大工程师也正在努力尽法回国寻找职业。
