　　Using Mao Zedong Thought as Guiding Ideology
　　Wuhan Establishes Various Philosophy and Social Science Societies
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 18th—Under the organization of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Wuhan's philosophy and social science circles have established the Philosophy Society, Political Science and Law Society, History Society, Economics Society, Education Society, and Linguistics Society over the past month. More than a thousand researchers, university professors, lecturers, and staff members from government offices with practical work experience and a love for scientific research have participated in these organizations.

    Li Da, President of Wuhan University and member of the Philosophy and Social Sciences Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, stated at the founding meeting of the Philosophy Society that the purpose of establishing these organizations is to cultivate and strengthen the theoretical ranks of philosophy and social sciences in the Wuhan area. The research work of each society particularly emphasizes the application of Chairman Mao's theory on two types of contradictions and his theory on contradictions among the people under socialism as the guiding ideology for research work in philosophy and social sciences. This is to clearly explain the experiences and problems that arise in Hubei Province's production and various other endeavors, summarize them, and elevate them to a theoretical level, thereby promoting practical work and production.

    Each society has formulated one-year and five-year work outlines, established research topics based on the principle of valuing the present over the past, and is actively engaged in academic research activities. For example, the Philosophy Society has set out nineteen topics such as "Hong'an, Macheng Experimental Fields" and "The Enthusiasm and Creativity of the People Under the Socialist System." Each society will also organize regular and irregular academic discussion meetings, symposiums, and report meetings.
