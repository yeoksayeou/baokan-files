Xinhua News Agency, May 8th: According to TASS, New York, May 7th: Reports from American newspapers and news agency reporters in Manila prove that the Philippines, which is politically, militarily, and economically dependent on the United States, is now experiencing severe difficulties.

    The "Christian Science Monitor" reporter Serson pointed out that the Philippine residents are currently disturbed by rising prices and the large number of unemployed. 2.5 million out of the Philippines' eight million workers cannot find jobs.

    When mentioning the living conditions of the working people, Serson pointed out that because workers' wages are low, their families cannot obtain many necessities, and speculators openly raise rice prices to twice the official price. Agricultural production has also decreased by 20% to 30%. Many provinces have no construction being carried out.

    菲经济遭到严重困难
    三分之一的工人失业
    据新华社8日讯　据塔斯社纽约7日讯：据美国各报和通讯社记者自马尼拉发出的消息证明，在政治、军事和经济上依附美国的菲律宾现在正遭受到严重的困难。
    “基督教科学箴言报”记者赛森指出，菲律宾居民目前正为物价上涨和失业者大批出现而感到不安。菲律宾八百万工人中就有二百五十万人找不到工作。
    赛森提到劳动人民的生活状况时指出，由于工人的工资低，他的家庭没法得到许多生活必需品，同时投机商公开把米价抬高到两倍于官方的价格。农业生产也减少了20％到30％。许多省份没有进行什么建设。
