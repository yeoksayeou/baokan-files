    Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 27th: The spirit of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China is inspiring and encouraging the builders of Baotou Steel. They are accelerating the construction of the new steel capital, determined to greatly shorten the time it takes for the country's steel production to catch up with that of Great Britain.
    Today, on the construction sites of Baotou Steel's iron smelting, coke chemistry, and machine repair facilities, Party workers repeatedly reported the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China to the workers, and the sound of the broadcasts drowned out the noise of construction. The workers stated that they would resolutely implement the General Line and accelerate the construction of Baotou Steel. At the blast furnace site, the foundation pits for the blast furnace and hot blast stove have been laid with bedding, and steel workers have welded more than seventy steel mesh sheets from thick steel bars. Starting from the 28th, they will formally install the foundation steel bars. Liang Xiangli, the captain of the steel bar team, technician Hui Yongquan, and old carpenter Qi Wenbin said that the superiors stipulated that the task of installing the steel mesh within twelve days must be completed within seven days. At the coke oven site, the foundations of two coke ovens have been laid with concrete. Due to the promotion of the spirit of communist cooperation among construction units and workers of all types of work, the concrete pouring time for each coke oven foundation has been shortened from seventy-two hours to forty-four hours. Inspired by the General Line, the workers at this site proposed to complete these two coke ovens four months ahead of schedule.
    Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th: The workers of Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant, fighting beside the steelmaking and ironmaking furnaces, are celebrating the victorious closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China with practical actions of technological innovation and record-breaking.
    Since the workers of the electric furnace steelmaking department saw the news of the closing of the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in the newspaper on the 25th, they have continuously created four new records in shortening smelting time by the afternoon of the 26th. Initially, the Guo Yong team used the full oxidation method to refine carbon steel, creating a smelting time record of 2 hours and 29 minutes, which was 29 minutes shorter than before. The Wang Rucheng team used the non-oxidation method to refine carbon steel, creating a new record for shortening the smelting time. But the Gao Zhenhai team went ahead again, and the record created by this team was 1 hour and 54 minutes, with completely qualified quality.
    The youth blast furnace, which created a new national record for blast furnace utilization coefficient, was overtaken by Benxi and Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plants in mid-May. In the past two days, inspired by the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, the workers of the youth blast furnace continued to increase the smelting intensity and coke load, creating the latest record for blast furnace utilization coefficient, while ensuring smooth furnace conditions. Liu Xueren, the head of the youth furnace, told reporters during the tense work that they are brewing a proposal to all blast furnaces in the country to create new records for utilization coefficient calculated on a weekly, ten-day, or monthly basis, in order to maintain a steady increase in pig iron production.
    At noon on the 26th, dazzling sparks of steel burst out from the No. 3 open hearth furnace, which is famous throughout the country. This was the 110th furnace of steel smelted by this furnace since the "three-tap steel" was officially put into production. The steelworkers nervously tapped the molten steel, immediately added raw materials, and strived to produce another furnace of high-quality steel that night. They plan to overhaul the No. 3 open hearth furnace in June, and strive to increase the output of each furnace by another fifteen tons without state investment. (Attached picture)
    The young men of the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant youth blast furnace, drum up revolutionary enthusiasm and strive to realize the general line of building socialism. On May 25, they created a national record of 0.444 for the blast furnace utilization coefficient, surpassing Sweden's 0.460, the country with the lowest blast furnace utilization coefficient in the world, and reaching the world's most advanced level. This new record is already the thirteenth new record created by this blast furnace this year. This is the youth blast furnace tapping iron. Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhou Shuming

    包钢加快建设速度
    太钢工人两天四创新纪录
    新华社包头27日电　中共八大第二次会议的精神激励和鼓舞着包钢的建设者。他们正在加速新钢都的建设，要使祖国的钢铁产量赶上英国的时间大大缩短。
    今天在包钢炼铁、焦炭化学、机修等工地上，党的工作人员向工人们反复报告了“八大”二次会议闭幕的消息，广播的声音盖过了施工的喧闹。工人们纷纷表示要坚决贯彻总路线，加快包钢的建设。高炉工地上，高炉和热风炉的基础坑已经打好垫层，钢筋工们已经用粗大的钢筋焊接成了七十多个钢筋网片，从28日起，他们就要正式安装基础的钢筋了。钢筋队队长梁向理、技术员惠永权、老木工齐文斌表示上级规定用十二天的时间安装好钢筋网的任务，他们一定要保证在七天内完成。在焦化工地上，两座炼焦炉基础已经打好混凝土。由于各施工单位和各工种职工发扬了共产主义协作精神，使每座焦炉基础混凝土浇灌时间从七十二小时缩短到四十四小时。这个工地的职工在总路线的鼓舞下，提出要提前四个月建成这两座焦炉。
    新华社太原27日电　战斗在炼钢炼铁炉旁的太原钢铁厂职工们，正以革新技术、创造新纪录的实际行动，庆祝中共八大二次会议的胜利闭幕。
    电炉炼钢部的工人们从25日看到报纸上刊载中共八大二次会议闭幕的消息起，到26日下午，已经连续创造了四次缩短冶炼时间的新纪录。最初是郭勇小组采用全氧化法炼炭素钢，创造了冶炼时间二点二十九分的纪录，比原来缩短二十九分钟。王汝成小组炼炭素钢采用不氧化法，又创造了缩短冶炼时间的新纪录。但是高振海小组接着又跑到前面去了，这个小组创造的纪录是一点五十四分，质量完全合格。
    创造全国高炉利用系数新纪录的青年高炉，5月中旬一度被本溪和石景山钢铁厂赶过了。这两天内，青年高炉的工人们受到中共八大二次会议的鼓舞，在保证炉况顺行的情况下，继续提高冶炼强度和焦炭负荷，又创造了高炉利用系数最新纪录。青年炉长刘学仁在紧张劳动的间隙告诉记者说，他们为了保持生铁产量稳定上升，正在酝酿向全国所有高炉提出创造按周、按旬或按月计算利用系数新纪录的倡议。
    26日中午，闻名全国的三号平炉上喷射出了耀眼的钢铁火花，这是这个炉子自“三槽出钢”正式投入生产以后炼出的第一百一十炉钢。炼钢工人紧张地出完这炉钢水，马上又加原料，争取晚上再出一炉优质钢。他们打算在6月份中修三号平炉，争取不要国家投资，就把每炉钢的产量再提高十五吨。（附图片）
    太原钢铁厂青年高炉的小伙子们，鼓起革命干劲，努力实现建设社会主义的总路线。5月25日，他们创造了高炉利用系数0.444的全国最高纪录，超过了世界上高炉利用系数最低的国家——瑞典的0.460，达到了世界最先进的行列。这次新纪录，已经是这个高炉今年以来创造的第十三次新纪录了。这是青年高炉正在出铁。　新华社记者　周树铭摄
