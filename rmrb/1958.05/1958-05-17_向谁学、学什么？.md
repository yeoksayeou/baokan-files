Who to Learn From, What to Learn?
  Cao Yusan
    The fourth day of participating in the construction of the Ming Tombs Reservoir was our hardest. Our legs ached, our backs were sore, our shoulders were swollen, and our hands were cracked. Especially our feet, after carrying earth all day, we still had to walk fifteen more li back to the camp after work.
    By coincidence, an empty truck drove up from a road on the left. It suddenly stopped about six or seventy meters away from us. The driver and the loaders on the truck waved to us, and we swarmed towards it. But there was still one person hobbling towards us from afar. The driver didn't notice, and the truck started moving. The loaders on the truck shouted repeatedly, "There's one more! There's one more!" But the driver still couldn't hear.
    "Forget it! He's still far away!" It was Engineer Xu speaking. The truck continued forward for another two or three meters, making the loaders anxious. He banged on the roof of the driver's cab several times!
    "Let's go! There's no more room," It was Engineer Xu's impatient voice again. With a "ka" sound, the truck braked. The loaders finally breathed a sigh of relief. That comrade got on the truck, with a grateful look.
    The matter is that simple, but shouldn't it be clear who we should learn from and what we should learn?

　　向谁学、学什么？
  　曹育三
    参加修建十三陵水库的第四天，是我们最难过的一天。腿痛、腰酸、肩肿，手裂不说，特别是脚，担了一天土，休工后还要再跑十五里路回宿营地去。
    真巧，从左边的一条道上，开来了一辆空卡车。在离我们约六、七十公尺处，突然停了下来。司机和车上的装卸工人，向我们招了招手，我们蜂涌而上。但远远的还有一个人往这边一拐一拐地跑来。司机没有发觉，车开动了。车上的装卸工人连声大喊：“还有一个！还有一个！”司机还是听不见。
    “算了吧！还远着呢！”是徐工程师在说话。车又继续向前开了二三公尺，急坏了装卸工人，他就在驾驶台的篷顶上砰！砰！砰！……连敲了数下。
    “快开吧！已经挤不下了。”又是徐工程师不耐烦的声音。卡的一声，车煞住了。装卸工人才松了一口气。那位同志上了车，怀着感激的目光。
    事情就这么简单，但应该向谁学习，学习什么？还看不清楚吗？
