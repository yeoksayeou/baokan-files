Liu Rentao Goes Deep into Reality to Treat Eye Diseases for the Masses

　　(Reported by our newspaper) Liu Rentao, a member of the Shanghai Branch of the Writers Association, a member of the Ophthalmology Society of the All-China Medical Association, and an ophthalmology expert, wrote several films after liberation that were welcomed by the masses, such as "Life Symphony," "When the Motherland Needs It," and "Cradle of Life." This time, to experience life, he returned to his hometown of Huangmei County, Hubei Province. In response to the Writers Association's call for "practical work first," he brought ophthalmological equipment and lived in the Longgan Lake State Farm in Huangmei, planning to treat 10,000 people with eye diseases and perform 1,000 various sterile ophthalmic surgeries in one year, and to train 30 ophthalmic professionals at the county and district levels. He started work on February 25th, and by April 24th, he had seen 4,129 outpatients with eye problems. He started surgery on March 7th, and by April 29th, he had completed 426 sterile ophthalmic surgeries (including entropion and trichiasis caused by trachoma, pterygium, iridoplasty, etc.). He saw an average of 68 outpatients and performed 8 surgeries per day. The amount of surgery alone exceeded eleven times the amount of surgery performed by the ophthalmology department of the Jiujiang Special District People's Hospital. (Zeng Wenzhi)
