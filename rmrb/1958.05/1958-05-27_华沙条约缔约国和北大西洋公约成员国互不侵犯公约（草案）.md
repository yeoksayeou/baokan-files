	Draft Treaty of Non-Aggression Between the Warsaw Treaty Member States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Member States
	The Contracting Parties, the States Parties to the Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance signed on May 14, 1955, on the one hand, and the Member States of the North Atlantic Treaty signed on April 4, 1949, on the other hand,

	Desiring to promote the realization of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations in international relations;

	Attaching great importance to the necessity of maintaining and developing peaceful relations and cooperation among all countries based on the principles of equality, non-interference in internal affairs, non-aggression, and mutual respect for territorial integrity and national sovereignty;

	Being willing to promote the relaxation of international tensions and the creation of an atmosphere of universal trust among countries; considering that, under the conditions of the existence of two mutually opposed groups of states in Europe, the assumption by the member states of these two groups of the obligation not to resort to force or the threat of force in international relations is of great significance for the improvement of the international situation, for stopping the arms race and for eliminating the threat of a new war.

	For this reason, [they] have decided to sign this Treaty of Non-Aggression and have authorized the following plenipotentiaries to sign:

	On the side of the Warsaw Treaty Member States: the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the People's Republic of Poland, and the Czechoslovak Republic,

Therefore, [they] solemnly guarantee to strictly abide by this provision and not to resort to force or the threat of force in joint or separate mutual confrontation.

				Article 2

	Disputes arising between one or several states participating in the Warsaw Treaty on the one hand, and one or several states participating in the North Atlantic Treaty on the other hand, shall be resolved only peacefully, in a spirit of mutual understanding, through negotiations between the parties concerned and by other means of peaceful settlement of international disputes provided for in the Charter of the United Nations, in full compliance with non-interference in the internal affairs of each country.

				Article 3

	In the event of a situation arising that may threaten peace or security in Europe, the Contracting Parties to this Treaty shall consult with each other and take and implement appropriate joint measures consistent with the Charter of the United Nations to seek a peaceful solution.
