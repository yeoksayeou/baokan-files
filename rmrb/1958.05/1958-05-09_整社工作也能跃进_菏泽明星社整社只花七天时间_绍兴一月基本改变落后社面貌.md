Great Leap Forward in Rectification Work

Heze's Star Commune Completes Rectification in Just Seven Days; Shaoxing Basically Changes the Face of Backward Communes in One Month

(Reported by our newspaper) Can commune rectification also achieve a great leap forward? The experience of the Heze Area Working Group of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee in rectifying the Star Agricultural Commune in Tianhuitun Township, Heze County, provides an affirmative answer.

The Star Commune was a Class Three commune in Tianhuitun Township that had not been resolved for a long time. Before the arrival of the working group, other villages were experiencing a production upsurge, while this commune was in a slump. At 10 a.m., commune members had not yet gone to the fields to work, and many livestock were reduced to "skin and bones." To find out why it had become a Class Three commune, the working group first held a forum. It was reported that the commune had five main problems: 1. Unclear rewards and punishments; there were no rules and regulations in the commune. The commune members were most dissatisfied with the fact that the problem of a production team leader stealing wheat in 1956 was not dealt with. The commune originally had more than 270 head of livestock, but because there were no rewards for feeding them well and no penalties for letting them die, only 95 head remained. Financial management was also chaotic, with accounts only being announced once in more than two years. 2. Individual leaders were not good. The current commune director was essentially a good person, but he was not strong-willed and had no opinions of his own, and was often taken advantage of. Chao Ditong, a member of the commune committee, was a hooligan, but he controlled the power within the commune. 3. There were no work quotas for labor, and the work point remuneration was unreasonable. The commune still used the "recording work points by day" method from the mutual aid team era, with men, women, the old, and the young all receiving three points regardless of how much they worked. This could not reflect the principle of more pay for more work, so no one was actively engaged in production. 4. Farmers with production experience were not in charge. 5. The labor organization was unreasonable, and there were many problems in operation and management. The entire commune of 310 households was divided into four brigades, eight teams, and 38 production groups. Each group generally consisted of seven or eight households, but some consisted of only one household with four laborers, effectively becoming individual households. No one was effectively responsible for management, and there were neither long-term plans nor short-term plans for production, but rather doing things one day at a time.

Based on these problems, the working group and the township and commune cadres decided to lay them out to the masses one by one and mobilize the masses to speak out and debate. At first, the masses had concerns, but later they heard that people from the province had come and were really going to solve the problems, so the speaking out and debate became heated. The first debate was on the issue of the commune committee's organization, who should stay and who should be removed. After the debate, it was unanimously agreed that Chao Ditong, a member of the commune committee, was a bad person and it was decided to remove him. As for the commune director, everyone thought that he was a good person, but he had a habit of enjoying good food and drink, had no opinions of his own, and was taken advantage of by Chao Ditong. He was asked to make a self-criticism and retain his position as commune director, with a deadline of one year for him to completely change. The commune director expressed his gratitude for this decision, made a relatively deep self-criticism, and said that he was determined to do good things for everyone in the future. After the meeting, he immediately went to the fields to work with the commune members. The masses were very satisfied with this decision, and the enthusiasm for speaking out and debate was even greater.

Regarding the operation and management of the commune, after democratic discussion, nine systems were formulated, including cadre participation in labor and rewards and punishments for livestock breeding. The labor organization was changed, and the backbone of the production teams was appropriately adjusted. As for labor quotas, in accordance with everyone's requirements, several major farm tasks were carried out first, and short-term contracting was immediately implemented.

Finally, at everyone's request, after democratic discussion, the commune's 1958 production plan targets and various measures were formulated. This year, the average yield per mu for the entire commune will be 447 jin, an increase of nearly double compared to the actual production in 1956.

The rectification of this commune took only seven days, and the entire commune took on a new look. The masses generally reflected, "Now there is hope" and "It's like living a life." Now the commune cadres are working actively, staying up until midnight and getting up before dawn to go to the fields and work with the commune members. The labor attendance rate of each team generally reaches about 90%, and some reach 100%.

(Reported by our newspaper) In late February, there were still 180 Class Three and relatively poor Class Two communes in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang. After a month of rectification, these communes have basically changed their backward outlook, with 15% having leapt forward to become Class One communes and 75% becoming Class Two communes. The key experiences in the commune rectification work are:

1. Increasing the number of cadres, assigning special personnel in charge, strengthening specific leadership at all levels, carrying it through to the end, and always persisting. The county party committee appointed a standing committee member to be responsible, and transferred more than 200 cadres as resident cadres in the Class Three communes, stipulating that they would not be moved for one year and would be permanently fixed. The districts and townships all had special personnel in charge (usually the deputy secretary or committee member) to achieve unified planning, divided operations, and timely exchange of experience.

2. The revolutionary drive and leadership style of the resident cadres. Taking two agricultural communes in Lanting Township with the same conditions as an example: Han Shangqin, the resident cadre of the Zihongshan Commune, wore farmers' clothes, lived in farmers' homes, went deep into backward teams, took the lead in repairing reservoirs, worked hard, and moved the masses, which promoted the work and quickly changed the backward outlook of the commune. Yu Zhongyan, the cadre stationed in Chencun Commune, was not determined, his thinking wavered, he complained constantly, and retreated in the face of difficulties, so the backward outlook of the commune hardly changed.

3. Conducting commune rectification around the rectification campaign. Most of the opinions expressed in the Class Three commune rectification campaign belonged to cadre work style and production issues. Therefore, whether the leaders have the determination to rectify is very important. The Zhongmeiao Commune in Hengxi Township, because it carried out speaking out and earnestly listened to the opinions of the masses, seriously dealt with Feng Rutang, the commune director who took the lead in demanding to withdraw from the commune and privately distribute grain, and Gao Yunlai, the small team leader who had always led a corrupt life and did not work. As a result, the morale of the masses was high and they quickly leapt forward to become a Class One commune. However, the Gaogiao Commune did not dare to mobilize the masses to speak out and let off steam, and did not seize the opportunity to rectify after a small amount of speaking out and letting off steam, so the backward outlook remained unchanged.

4. In the process of rectifying Class Three communes, it is necessary to train and cultivate a class team mainly composed of poor peasants at all levels, give full play to the role of new forces, conscientiously do a good job in adjusting the backbone, and comprehensively implement and execute the Party's class policy in rural areas. For example, after the Jianhua Commune in Silin Township elected Sun Jiantang, a poor peasant activist, as the commune director, the masses had full confidence and full of energy, and it has now become an advanced commune in the township.

### 整社工作也能跃进  菏泽明星社整社只花七天时间  绍兴一月基本改变落后社面貌

    整社工作也能跃进
    菏泽明星社整社只花七天时间  绍兴一月基本改变落后社面貌
    本报讯　整社能否跃进？中共山东省委菏泽地区工作组整顿菏泽县佃户屯乡明星农业社的经验，作了肯定地回答。
    明星社是佃户屯乡一个长期没有解决的三类社。在工作组未来之前，别村是生产高潮，这个社是低潮，上午十点钟社员还没有下地生产，很多牲口都瘦成“皮包骨头”。为了弄清变成三类社的原因，工作组去后首先召开了一个座谈会。据反映，这个社存在五个主要问题：一、赏罚不明，社里办事没有章程；社员们对1956年曾有一个生产队长率领社员偷麦问题不作处理最为不满。这个社原来有二百七十多头牲口，由于喂好了不奖，喂死了不罚，现在只剩下九十五头。财务管理也很乱，二年多只公布了一次账。二、个别领导人不好，现在的社主任本质上是个好人，但是腰干子不硬，没有主见，常常被人利用；社委委员晁岱同是个流氓，却掌握着社内的大权。三、干活没有定额，工分报酬不合理；社里还是采用互助组时代“按天记工”的办法，男女老少干多干少一律三分，不能体现多劳多得的原则，因此，谁也不积极生产。四、有生产经验的农民不当家。五、劳动组织不合理，经营管理上的问题很多，全社三百一十户，分为四个大队，八个小队，三十八个生产组，每组一般的七、八户，个别的一户四个劳力算一组，实际上成了单干户。管理上无人切实负责，生产上既没有长远规划，也没有小段计划，而是干一天说一天。
    根据这些问题，工作组与乡社干部研究决定一个一个的向群众摆开，发动群众鸣放辩论。起先群众有顾虑，后来听说省里来人，真的要解决问题，鸣放辩论就热烈了。首先辩论社委会组织问题，那些人该留那些人该撤。经过辩论，一致认为社委委员晁岱同是个坏人，决定撤下来。对社主任，大家认为他是个好人，但有好吃好喝的毛病，自己没主见，被晁岱同利用，要他检讨，保留社主任职务，限他在一年内彻底转变。社主任对这个处理表示很感激，检讨比较深刻，表示今后决心为大家办好事，会后马上下地同社员一道干活。群众对这样处理很满意，鸣放辩论的劲头就更大了。
    关于社内的经营管理，经过民主讨论，制订了干部参加劳动、牲口饲养奖惩等九项制度。改变了劳动组织，适当调整了生产队的骨干。对劳动定额，按照大家的要求，先搞了几项主要的农活，并马上实行小段包工。
    最后，在大家要求下，经过民主讨论，制定了全社1958年的生产计划指标和各项措施，今年全社每亩平均产量四百四十七斤，这个指标比1956年实产将近增加一倍。
    这个社的整顿，前后只用了七天时间，使全社气象一新。群众普遍反映：“现在有了盼头”，“像个过日子的样子了”。现在社干工作积极，晚上熬到半夜，天不亮就起床，下地和社员一起干活。各队劳动出勤率一般达到90％左右，有的达到100％。
    本报讯　浙江绍兴县在2月下旬尚有三类社及较差的二类社一百八十个。经过一个月的整顿，这些社已经基本改变了落后面貌，其中有15％已经跃进为一类社，75％变成二类社。整社工作中的几点重要经验是：
    一、加派干部，专人负责，级级加强具体领导，一贯到底，始终坚持。县委指定了一个常委委员负责，并抽调干部二百多人作为三类社驻社干部，规定一年不动，长期固定；区乡均有专人负责（一般是副书记或委员），做到统一计划，分线作战，及时交流经验。
    二、驻社干部的革命干劲和领导作风。以兰亭乡两个条件相同的农业社为例：紫红山社的驻社干部韩尚勤，穿农民衣，住农民家，深入落后队，带头修水库，苦干苦钻，感动了群众，推动了工作，使这个社的落后面貌很快的有了转变；驻在陈村社的干部俞中炎，决心不大，思想动摇，叫苦连天，遇难而退，因而该社落后面貌始终改变很少。
    三、围绕整风进行整社。三类社整风中鸣放出的意见绝大部分是属于干部作风和生产问题，因此，领导是否有决心整改，关系很大。横溪乡中眉岙社，由于开展了鸣放，认真听取群众意见，对带头闹退社私分稻谷的社主任冯如堂，一贯生活腐化、不干活的小队长高云来，均进行了严肃的处理，因此群众情绪高涨，迅速跃进为一类社。但是，高桥社由于不敢发动群众大鸣大放，而且小鸣小放以后又没有抓住整改，因此落后面貌仍然未变。
    四、在整顿三类社的过程中，必须层层训练培养以贫农为主的阶级队伍，充分发挥新生力量的作用，认真做好调整骨干的工作，完整地贯彻与执行党在农村中的阶级政策。如四林乡建华社改选贫农积极分子孙见堂为社主任后，群众信心百倍、劲头十足，现在成为全乡的先进社。
