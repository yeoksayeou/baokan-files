    New Ticketing Method
    The Changchun Victory Cinema has recently created a new ticketing method. They installed a small "Theater Seating Grid Box" inside the glass window above the ticket window. This box is marked with seat numbers, and each grid contains a rolled-up movie ticket and a seat number ticket. At a glance, you can see which row and number tickets are still available and which have been sold. The audience can freely choose and buy their desired seat numbers, and the ticket seller can immediately take out the ticket the audience wants to buy from the grid box. The audience all commented that this ticketing method is good: it is efficient, sells tickets quickly, saves the ticket seller the time of asking for and finding numbers, and people buying tickets no longer have to stand in line and wait for a long time.

    新的售票法
    长春胜利电影院最近创造了一种新的售票法。他们在售票口上面玻璃窗内安放一个小小的“影场座次方格箱”，标有座次号码，每个方格里放了一个卷好的电影票和座号票，一看就知道那排那号的票还有，那排那号的票已经卖了，观众可以随便选买自己想要的座号，售票员也可立即从方格箱里取出那张观众要买的票来。观众都议论说这种售票法好：效率高，卖票快，节省了售票员问号和找号的时间，买票的人不必再站排老等了。
