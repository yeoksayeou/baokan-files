Ideological Emancipation, Work Leap Forward
Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China

    In the past year or so, like other provinces, the Fujian Party organization has undergone extremely profound changes, and a rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle centered on correctly handling contradictions among the people has been carried out throughout the province. This struggle has achieved great results on the political, economic, and cultural fronts. Rectification has become a mass movement, and the mass rectification upsurge has further promoted the mass production and construction upsurge and the cultural construction upsurge.
    
  The Great Leap Forward Must Oppose Three Tendencies and Five Vices
    
    The general line and general policy of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" formulated by the Party Central Committee based on the proposal of Comrade Mao Zedong is a summary of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and construction experience over the past eight years. It centrally reflects the will of the people of the whole country and the objective laws of Chinese revolutionary practice. However, we did not fully understand and grasp this correct policy and line all at once. In the second half of 1955 and the first half of 1956, we implemented the correct line of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and aroused the enthusiasm of the masses, and our work leaped forward. In the second half of 1956, due to the influence of "anti-adventurism," the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses was frustrated, and our work suffered losses. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong promptly corrected this mistake, and our work then leaped forward again on a larger scale in an all-round way. Only after such a repeated struggle process, and after accepting profound lessons, did we further understand and grasp the correct line of the Party Central Committee and the thought of Mao Zedong.
    
    In February of this year, at the four-level cadre meeting of Sanming County, a county committee in our province, a comparison craze of planning, measures, and drive was set off, and everyone competed to be advanced. The meeting went very well. However, it also reflected a problem. The comrades asked the county committee: "In the first half of 1956, we had great enthusiasm, but in the second half of the year we were scolded. This year's enthusiasm is even greater, will we still be scolded in the second half of the year?" This shows how anti-"adventurism" frustrated the socialist enthusiasm of cadres and the masses. Cadres and the masses still have lingering pain from the anti-"adventurism" of the second half of 1956, which is indeed a profound lesson. How did the Sanming County Committee answer this question at that time? The county committee said: "After rectification and the anti-rightist struggle, we will no longer be scolded." The county committee's answer did not completely solve the comrades' problem. At this time, the provincial party committee conveyed Chairman Mao's instructions to them, telling them: "Be prepared to be scolded at any time. First, grit your teeth and resist. Second, have analysis. If the scolding is correct, correct it. If the scolding is incorrect, criticize it." In this way, the comrades felt relieved. The situation in the whole province was roughly the same as in Sanming. After conveying Chairman Mao's instructions, the concerns and lingering pain caused by anti-"adventurism" were completely eliminated. When the mind is emancipated, the "qi" is stronger, and the enthusiasm is even greater. The example of Sanming County eloquently shows that the correct line of the Party and the thought of Mao Zedong are precisely the urgent demands of the broad masses.
    
    Our process of implementing the correct line of the Party Central Committee is also a process of ideological struggle. In our area, the thought of "the doctrine of the mean" is an obstacle to our progress. Some people are satisfied with "being better than those below but not as good as those above." They actually cannot see the advanced or the backward, and they are "more stable than bold," afraid of risks, and dare not ride the waves. In their view, "production can be increased, but there can be no leap forward." They see things but not people, and do not believe in the great power and wisdom of the masses. "The doctrine of the mean" is actually "the way to fall behind," a kind of decadence. In the situation of the great leap forward in socialist construction, in order to prevent the leadership from lagging behind the masses and the development of the situation, we must carry out the rectification movement to the end and resolutely oppose the three tendencies and five vices.
    
    The existence of various decadent attitudes among some comrades in the Party is not an accidental phenomenon, but has its social foundation. It is a reflection of the backward thinking among the masses and the decadent attitude of the well-to-do middle peasants in the countryside. Now, who among the masses has decadence? The typical investigation in Chengmen Township, Minhou County, proves that it is mainly the well-to-do middle peasants. The well-to-do middle peasants in this township own a large number of fruit trees and cows, and nominally joined the cooperative by means of proportional dividends, but in fact they are still operated by them personally. Because the income from cash crops is very large (each cow earns more than 1,000 yuan per year), they do not care about the cooperative and are unwilling to participate in collective labor. This township launched a large-scale production campaign to build farmland water conservancy and accumulate fertilizer last winter and this spring, but the well-to-do middle peasants ridiculed from the sidelines: "The family has a cornucopia (cows), the garden has a money tree (fruit trees), three o'clock of labor a day (referring to themselves), is better than a month of work in the cooperative (referring to the members)." The township party branch resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and launched a fierce ideological struggle with the well-to-do middle peasants in the "double opposition and double comparison" movement, incorporating all the fruit trees and cows in the township into the cooperative, transforming and uniting the well-to-do middle peasants, and making them lean towards the cooperative. Therefore, in one month this spring, they were able to realize the merger of townships and the joint establishment of cooperatives (five townships merged into one township, and forty-three cooperatives merged into one cooperative, divided into thirteen sub-cooperatives), leveled the land, transformed the roads, built more than 140 li of simple highways and avenues, adjusted irrigation channels, unified the use of power water pumps, and completely changed the face of the individual economy, paving the way for the agricultural production to leap forward again and realize agricultural mechanization.
    
    Jinsha Township, another township in Minhou County, also has a similar situation. After cooperation, this township fought hard for three years, overcoming poor mountains and bad waters, and turned beaches and barren hills into good fields with a yield of thousands of catties per mu. The well-to-do middle peasants in this township did not have the fruits and cows of Chengmen Township, but due to their different economic status, they were always reluctant to participate in the arduous labor of transforming nature and had a very decadent attitude. The Jinsha Township Party Branch resolutely relied on the poor and lower-middle peasants and constantly struggled with the decadent attitude of the well-to-do middle peasants, and only then did they win the victory of transforming nature. The situation in Chengmen Township and Jinsha Township is not isolated in the province. Many examples show that not only in the cooperative movement, it is necessary to resolutely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants to transform and unite the well-to-do middle peasants, but also in the struggle for socialist construction. The working class and the poor and lower-middle peasants are resolute promoters and thorough revolutionaries, while the upper petty bourgeoisie and the well-to-do middle peasants are always often skeptical and wavering. Of course, there is also decadence among some poor and lower-middle peasants, and there is also a struggle between the advanced and the backward. However, the struggle with the decadence of the well-to-do middle peasants has the nature of class struggle.
    
  Rectification Emancipated the Minds of All the People
    
    The extensive and in-depth development of the all-people rectification movement has emancipated the minds of the whole Party and all the people. The agricultural cooperatives, factories, enterprises, government agencies, schools and residents throughout the province are boiling, posting big-character posters, making suggestions, comparing advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, has become the conscious action of the broad masses of cadres and the masses. The work style of state organs has rapidly changed, streamlining institutions, decentralizing cadres, decentralizing meetings, leading cadres at all levels engaging in experimental fields, going to factories, going to the fields, going to schools, going to shops, going out for rectification, going deep into the field to investigate and study, discovering and solving problems in time, summarizing advanced experiences and promoting advanced experiences in time, has become a common practice.
    
    In the countryside, a magnificent labor army composed of millions of people, in one winter and spring, built river dams, repaired seawalls, conquered mountain torrents, blocked sea tides and storms, and built tens of thousands of mountain ponds and reservoirs, increasing and improving the irrigated area by more than 8 million mu. The original plan to basically eliminate drought in two years was basically realized in one winter and spring. The amount of fertilizer accumulated this winter and spring exceeded four times the total amount of last year, changing the habit of not fertilizing or fertilizing little in mountainous areas over the years. 5.38 million mu of afforestation. Improved soil 5.32 million mu. The number of pigs raised has reached 6.5 million, an average of more than two per household. In Ninghua County, which is full of mountains, the transformation to vehicles was realized in a few dozen days, "liberating the shoulders and ending the generational marriage of shoulders and carrying poles." The enthusiasm for building socialism is encouraging people to conquer nature and transform nature. In order to realize the agricultural development program ahead of schedule, the masses proposed "competing with the sky for time, competing with the land for profit," and "asking the rivers and seas for land, asking the barren mountains for grain." In order to completely eliminate the threat of drought, the masses vowed to "block the river water, block the mountain water, store the rainwater, and dig out the ground water." They sang the moving poem with the spirit of swallowing mountains and rivers: "Grasp the head of the big river, raise and straighten the cushion stone, then press the tail down, see if you flow backwards or not." In terms of industrial production, due to the unprecedented improvement in the consciousness of the vast number of employees in the province, and with great efforts, advanced indicators have been broken again and again. The production performance in the first quarter increased by 62.4% compared with the same period last year. The mysterious views of industry have been broken, product quality has been continuously improved, costs have been continuously reduced, and new products have been continuously trial-produced successfully. Even factories with backward tools and simple equipment have manufactured hundreds of new products such as tractors, three-wheeled motorcycles, three-wheeled trucks, generators, electric motors, and blowers. The revolutionary drive of the vast number of employees is like a storm, coming with great force. Learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and comparing the advanced, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, has become the action slogan of the vast number of employees. They proposed: "Compare the drive, contribute to catching up with the UK, compete for the advanced, and make contributions to socialism." Their revolutionary heroism ambition is: "Everyone must have the ambition to ascend to the sky, everyone must be like a sea dragon, you catch up with me and I catch up with you, heroes of today." The leap forward in industrial and agricultural production has also promoted the leap forward in cultural and educational undertakings, forming a comprehensive great leap forward in socialist construction, a great leap forward by the whole people. In just one month, 2,310 new agricultural middle schools were established in the province, with 85,287 students; 13,329 new private primary schools were established, with 525,113 students. Adding the students of the original public and private primary schools, there are already 2 million primary school students in the province, accounting for 92.54% of the total number of school-age children. The province has basically realized universal primary education and middle schools in every township. All schools have universally implemented the policy of combining work and study, which has caused profound changes among intellectuals. Great achievements have also been made in eliminating the four pests, paying attention to hygiene, and eliminating diseases such as schistosomiasis and filariasis, and the basic "four-without" cities (Zhangzhou City) and a large number of "four-without" townships and "four-without" communities have emerged.
    
  The Revolutionary Heroic Spirit of the People
    
    The all-people rectification, the emancipation of the mind, the revolutionary drive, has formed the revolutionary heroism spirit of the people in the Mao Zedong era, with an irresistible force and an invincible communist style. Now, "fighting hard for three years to change the backward face of our province" has become the action slogan of the whole Party and the whole people in our province. Therefore, we are fully confident of achieving an increase of more than 24% in grain production this year. We are also fully confident of realizing the National Agricultural Development Program five years ahead of schedule, realizing semi-mechanization and mechanization of agriculture, rural electrification, and striving to become a "thousand-catty province" and a "four-without province." The output value of local industry will exceed the output value of agriculture in five years, laying the foundation for local industry and changing the backward economic situation of our province. In the struggle to realize the above tasks, it should be seen that although the great achievements of the rectification movement have already blossomed and bear fruit on the political, ideological, economic, and cultural fronts, various old ideas, old habits, and old methods will still resist the emergence and growth of new things with stubborn inertia. We must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We must carry out the rectification movement to the end, achieve a complete victory in the rectification, remove all obstacles on the road to progress, completely emancipate our minds, and give full play to the endless wisdom and creativity hidden in the working people, in order to guarantee the victorious realization of the Party's general line and general policy for building socialism. We must continue to work hard, more deeply, more meticulously, and more steadily, to realize the plan for a leap forward in industrial and agricultural production this year, especially the plan for increased grain production this year. This is the key to deciding all issues. On the road ahead, we may still encounter many difficulties, such as serious natural disasters, or the sabotage of enemies at home and abroad, or difficulties that we have not yet anticipated. Only by making full ideological preparations will we not be frightened by difficulties or appear powerless in the face of difficulties.
    
    Our province is located on the front line of national defense. While building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, we should also always pay attention to maintaining a high degree of vigilance, strengthening the struggle against the enemy, and consolidating national defense. Over the past eight years, the People's Liberation Army stationed in our province has carried forward the glorious tradition of "being both a fighting force and a working force." In the struggle to consolidate coastal defense and defend socialist construction, it has severely cracked down on the enemy and achieved major victories. In the land reform and socialist transformation movements, the active support of the army has played a major role. In the past year, the entire army, in the midst of the intense struggle to defend coastal defense and the heavy training tasks, has actively participated in socialist construction, working shoulder to shoulder and hand in hand with the people of the whole province, and carried forward the noble qualities of the people's army. In the future, we must continue to strengthen the Party's leadership over the army, strengthen the leadership over the struggle against the enemy, and strive to accelerate socialist construction and ensure the victorious realization of various struggle tasks.

    思想解放　工作跃进
    中共福建省委第一书记　　叶飞
    在过去的一年多中间，福建党组织和其他省一样经历了极其深刻的变化，在全省范围内开展了以正确处理人民内部矛盾为中心的整风运动和反右派斗争。这个斗争，已经在政治、经济、文化各个战线上收到了伟大的成效。整风已成为全民性的运动，而全民的整风高潮又进一步推动了全民的生产建设高潮和文化建设高潮。
  大跃进必须反掉三风五气
    党中央根据毛泽东同志的倡议所制定的“鼓起干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总方针总路线，是八年来中国人民革命斗争和建设经验的总结，集中地反映了全国人民的意志和中国革命实践的客观规律。但是，我们并不是一下子就完全理解和掌握了这一正确的方针和路线的。1955年下半年和1956年上半年，我们执行了党中央和毛主席的正确路线，鼓起了群众的干劲，工作就跃进了。1956年的下半年，由于我们受到“反冒进”的影响，干部和群众的积极性就受了挫折，工作就受了损失。党中央和毛泽东同志及时地纠正了这个错误，我们的工作才又在更大的规模上全面跃进了。只是经过了这样一个反复的斗争过程，接受了深刻的教训，我们才进一步地理解和掌握了党中央的正确路线和毛泽东同志的思想。
    今年2月，在我省三明县委召开的全县四级干部会议上，掀起了一个比规划、比措施、比干劲、人人争先进的评比热潮，会议开得很好。但是，也反映了一个问题，同志们问县委：“1956年上半年干劲很大，下半年就挨骂，今年的干劲更大，下半年是否还会挨骂？”这说明了反“冒进”是如何地挫折了干部和群众的社会主义积极性，干部和群众对1956年下半年的反“冒进”还心有余痛，这确是一个深刻的教训。当时三明县委怎样回答这个问题呢？县委说：“经过整风和反右派斗争，不会再挨骂了。”县委的回答没有完全解决同志们的问题。这时，省委向他们传达了毛主席的指示，告诉他们：“要随时准备挨骂，第一，要硬着头皮顶住，第二，要有分析，骂得对的就改掉，骂得不对的就批判。”这样，同志们的心情就舒畅了。全省的情况大体和三明一样，传达了主席的指示之后，就彻底消除了反“冒进”所造成的顾虑和余痛。思想解放了，“气”更足了，干劲也就更大了。三明县的例子雄辩地说明了党的正确路线和毛泽东同志的思想，正是广大群众的迫切要求。
    我们贯彻党中央正确路线的过程，也是一个思想斗争的过程。在我们那里，“中庸之道”的思想是我们前进道路上的障碍。有些人满足于“比上不足，比下有余”。他们实际上是看不见先进，也看不见落后，“稳重有余，大胆不足”，害怕风险，不敢乘风破浪。在他们看来“可以增产，但不能跃进”。他们见物不见人，不相信群众的伟大力量和智慧。“中庸之道”，实际上是“落后之道”，是一种暮气。在社会主义建设事业大跃进的形势中，要使领导不落后于群众，不落后于形势的发展，就必须把整风进行到底，坚决反掉三风和五气。
    党内一些同志存在种种暮气，不是偶然的现象，是有它的社会基础的。是群众中落后思想和农村中富裕中农的暮气的反映。现在群众中什么人有暮气呢？闽侯县城门乡的典型调查证明，主要是富裕中农。这个乡的富裕中农拥有大量的果树和奶牛，名义上采取比例分红的办法入了社，实际上还是由他们个人经营。因为经济作物收入很大（一头奶牛每年收入一千多元），他们就不关心合作社，不愿意参加集体劳动。这个乡去冬今春掀起了兴修农田水利、积肥等大生产运动，富裕中农却在旁边讥笑说：“家有聚宝盆（奶牛），园有摇钱树（果树），一天劳动三点钟（指自己），赛过合作一月工（指社员）。”乡党支部坚决依靠贫农下中农，在双反双比运动中，同富裕中农又展开了一场激烈的思想斗争，将全乡果树、奶牛全部入了社，改造和团结了富裕中农，使他们向合作社靠拢了。因此，就能够在今春一个月的时间内，实现了并乡联社（五个乡并为一个乡，四十三个社联合为一个社，下分十三个分社），平整了土地，改造了道路，兴修了一百四十多华里的简易公路和大道，调整了灌溉渠道，统一了动力抽水机的使用，彻底改变了个体经济的面貌，为农业生产再跃进和实现农业机械化铺平了道路。
    闽侯县另一个乡——金砂乡也有这样的情况。这个乡在合作化以后，苦战三年，战胜了穷山恶水，把海滩和荒山地变成了亩产千斤的良田。这个乡的富裕中农并没有城门乡那样的水果和奶牛，但由于经济地位不同，总是不大愿意参加改造自然的艰苦劳动，暮气很大。金砂乡党支部坚决依靠贫农、下中农，不断地同富裕中农的暮气作斗争，才赢得了改造大自然的胜利。城门乡和金砂乡的情况在全省并不是个别的。很多例证说明，不仅在合作化运动的时候，要坚决依靠贫农、下中农，才能改造和团结富裕中农，就是在社会主义建设的斗争中也是如此。工人阶级和贫农、下中农是坚决的促进派，彻底的革命派，上层小资产阶级和富裕中农总是经常怀疑和动摇的。当然，在一些贫农、下中农中也有暮气，也存在着先进和落后的斗争。但是，和富裕中农的暮气作斗争，则带有阶级斗争的性质。
  整风解放了全民的思想
    全民整风运动广泛深入的开展，解放了全党和全民的思想。全省的农业合作社、工厂企业、机关、学校和居民沸腾起来了，出大字报，提意见，比先进，比多快好省，已成为广大干部和群众的自觉行动。国家机关的工作面貌迅速改观，精简机构，干部下放，会议下放，各级领导干部搞试验田，下厂、下田、下校、下店，出门整风，深入现场调查研究，及时发现问题和解决问题，及时总结先进经验和推广先进经验，已成为普遍风气。
    在农村中，几百万群众组成的一支雄伟的劳动大军，在一个冬春之间，筑河坝，修海堤，征服山涧急流，挡住海潮风暴，建成了数以万计的山塘水库，增加和改善了灌溉面积八百多万亩。原定两年内基本消灭旱灾的计划，一个冬春就基本实现了。今年一个冬春的积肥量就超过去年全年的四倍，改变了山区历年来不施肥和少施肥的习惯。造林五百三十八万亩。改良土壤五百三十二万亩。养猪已达到六百五十万头，平均每户二头以上。在崇山峻岭的宁化县，十几天内就实现了车子化，“解放了肩膀，结束了肩膀和扁担的世代姻缘”。建设社会主义的热情正鼓舞着人们去征服自然，改造自然。为了提前实现农业发展纲要，群众提出“与天争时，与地争利”，“向河海索地，向荒山要粮”。为彻底消灭旱灾的威胁，群众发誓要“把河水拦起来，把山水堵起来，把天水蓄起来，把地水挖出来”。他们用气吞山河的气概唱出：“一把抓住大河头，提高摆正垫石头，再把尾巴按下去，看你倒流不倒流”的动人诗篇。工业生产方面，由于全省广大职工的觉悟空前提高，鼓起干劲，先进指标一再被突破，第一季度的生产实绩比去年同期增长62.4％。工业的神秘观点被打破了，产品质量不断提高，成本不断降低，新产品不断地试制成功，就是工具落后、设备简陋的工厂也制造出了拖拉机、三轮摩托车、三轮载货卡车、发电机、电动马达、鼓风机等数以百计的新产品。广大职工的革命干劲像风暴一样，来势极猛。学先进、赶先进、比先进，比多快好省，已成为广大职工的行动口号。他们提出：“比干劲，为赶英国出力，争先进，为社会主义立功”，他们的革命英雄主义的雄心是：“人人要有登天志，个个要像出海蛟，你赶我来我赶你，英雄人物看今朝”。工农业生产的跃进，又推动了文化教育事业的跃进，形成了社会主义建设的全面大跃进，全民大跃进。在短短一个月之内，全省新办了农业中学二千三百一十所，学生达八万五千二百八十七人；新办的民办小学一万三千三百二十九所，学生达五十二万五千一百一十三人，加上原有公立和民办小学的学生，全省已有小学生二百万人，占学龄儿童总数92.54％。全省基本上已实现了普及小学和乡乡有中学。各学校普遍贯彻了勤工俭学的方针，在知识分子中引起了深刻的变化。除四害、讲卫生，消灭血吸虫、血丝虫等疾病，也取得了很大成绩，出现了基本“四无”市（漳州市）和大批的“四无”乡、“四无”社。
  人民群众的革命英雄气概
    全民整风，思想解放，革命干劲，形成了毛泽东时代人民群众的革命英雄主义气概，势如破竹、所向披靡的共产主义风格。现在“苦战三年，改变我省落后面貌”，已成为我省全党全民的行动口号。因此，我们完全有信心在今年内达到增产粮食24％以上。也完全有信心提前五年实现全国农业发展纲要，实现农业半机械化和机械化，农村电气化，争取成为“千斤省”“四无省”。地方工业产值在五年内超过农业产值，打下地方工业的基础，改变我省经济落后状况。在实现上述任务的斗争中，应该看到，整风运动的伟大成就，虽然已经在政治、思想、经济、文化各个战线上开花结果，但是各种旧思想、旧习惯、旧方法还是会以顽强的惰性来抗拒新事物的出现和成长的。我们决不能满足于已得的成绩，必须把整风运动进行到底，取得整风的全胜，扫除在前进道路上的一切障碍，彻底解放思想，使蕴藏在劳动人民中的无穷无尽的智慧和创造性发挥出来，才能够保证党的建设社会主义的总方针总路线胜利实现。我们要继续努力，更深入地、更细致地、更踏实地干，实现今年工、农业生产跃进的计划，特别是今年粮食增产的计划。这是决定一切问题的关键。在前进道路上，我们还可能遇到许多困难，例如严重的自然灾害，或者是内外敌人的破坏，或者是现在还没有预料到的困难，作好充分的思想准备，才不会被困难所吓倒或在困难面前表现无力。
    我省地处国防前线，在多快好省地建设社会主义的同时，还应该经常地注意保持高度的警惕性，加强对敌斗争，巩固国防。八年来，驻我省的人民解放军，发扬了“既是战斗队，又是工作队”的光荣传统。在巩固海防，保卫社会主义建设的斗争中，狠狠地打击了敌人，取得了重大的胜利；在土地改革和社会主义改造运动中，军队的积极支援起了重大的作用。近一年来，全军在紧张的保卫海防斗争和繁重的训练任务中，又积极地参加社会主义建设，同全省人民一起，肩并肩、手携手地艰苦奋斗，发扬了人民军队的高贵品质。今后我们要继续加强党对军队的领导，加强对敌斗争的领导，为加速社会主义建设，确保各项斗争任务的胜利实现而奋斗。
