    Warm Spring Township (Three Street Poems)
    Xu Chi
    The Past of Warm Spring Township
    Japanese devils were stationed at the Yongding Bridge,
    Landlords still exploited, bandits came to harass,
    The Kuomintang and the Home Return Corps,
    Even more destroyed and devastated the orchards,
    Thanks to the Eighth Route Army for opening up the base area,
    Persisting in revolutionary struggle until victory,
    Never had a meal of refined grains,
    The girls all married elsewhere.
    The Present of Warm Spring Township
    Girls from elsewhere come to marry our youth,
    Labor day dividends top the county.
    After eating dumplings on New Year's Eve, they get to work,
    Fruits and grains must have a bumper harvest,
    Turning a grain-deficient township into a grain-surplus township,
    Forestry is very profitable and needs further expansion,
    Deep wells are dug in Shaying, small dams are built in Warm Spring,
    Large canals are opened in Jiahe, the whole township is water-conserved.
    The Future of Warm Spring Township
    Clocking in and out to work,
    Airplanes spray pesticides,
    Electric lights are installed in the grape trellises,
    Red grapes are sent to the local winery,
    White grapes are transported to Tianjin in our own cars,
    Five windbreak forests to the west,
    From now on, wind and sand will not fly,
    Songs resonate in the club.

    暖泉乡（街头诗三首）
    徐迟
    暖泉乡的过去
    鬼子兵扎在永定桥，
    地主还剥削，土匪来骚扰，
    国民党、还乡团，
    更把果园破坏和摧残，
    多亏八路开辟了根据地，
    坚持革命斗争到胜利，
    从来没有一顿吃细粮，
    姑娘们都嫁他乡。
    暖泉乡的现在
    他乡姑娘来嫁我们的青年，
    劳动日分红冠全县。
    除夕夜吃过饺子就动手，
    花果要丰收，粮食也要大丰收，
    要把缺粮乡变成余粮乡，
    林业利大更要大扩张，
    沙营开深井，暖泉修小坝，
    夹河开大渠，全乡水利化。
    暖泉乡的将来
    出工收工看手表，
    飞机喷洒杀虫药，
    葡萄架里电灯装，
    红葡萄送进本乡的制酒厂，
    白葡萄用自家汽车运天津，
    西边五道防风林，
    从此风沙不飞扬，
    俱乐部里歌声响。
