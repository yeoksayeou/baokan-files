New People, New Ideas, New Customs
　　The Story of the Ring
　　Xu Lanjun, a student at Shanghai Municipal Fourth Girls' Middle School, has a family of six, including her parents and three sisters, and their life is not affluent. One day, when Xu Lanjun returned home from school and was planting trees with the young people in the neighborhood in front of her house, she suddenly saw a golden object in the soil. It turned out to be a duck-egg-shaped gold ring. Xu Lanjun was happy for this unexpected gain. She wiped the ring clean and prepared to keep it for herself. In the evening, Xu Lanjun's sister (a member of the Communist Youth League) learned that her younger sister had found a ring and said to her, "You are a Young Pioneer, and you should return what you find to its owner." Her mother also said to her, "Now it is a new society. After the rectification campaign, everyone's thinking is better. Even if we are poor, we cannot keep other people's things for our own use." When Xu Lanjun heard this, she thought of how sad she was when she lost her fountain pen in the past. Wouldn't the person who lost the ring be even sadder? She had also handed over the money she had found to the police when she was a child. Now that she was older and everyone was undergoing rectification, she could not have such bad behavior. Therefore, she entrusted her mother to hand over the ring to the police.
　　The next morning, police officer Gao Xiang took the ring to visit nearby residents. He discovered that Zhou Meixiang, Xu Lanjun's neighbor, had lost a ring twelve years ago when her child lost a ring that was exactly the same. However, when Gao Xiang returned the ring to Zhou Meixiang, a worker's family member, she refused to take it, saying, "This is the merit of the rectification campaign. The ring should be dedicated to the state." Because the police officer persuaded her repeatedly, Zhou Meixiang had to accept the ring. Finally, she discussed it with her husband and decided to convert the ring into cash and use it all to purchase public bonds. This was the first time she had bought public bonds since liberation.
　　Zhao Zongying's Transformation
　　Entering the courtyard at No. 32 Heng Street in Beijing, you can see Zhao Zongying sewing shoe soles, with her three-year-old daughter sitting beside her, wearing brand-new purplish-red corduroy single shoes. On a long rope in the yard, there are freshly washed sheets, clothes, and the child's diapers drying...
　　Making shoes and washing clothes are ordinary things for a housewife, but for Zhao Zongying, it was labor that began after the rectification campaign. In the past, Zhao Zongying used to sleep until almost noon every day before getting up. As soon as she got up, she prepared food for herself. She ate fish or meat every day, and also ate Xiaozhan rice. After eating her fill, she would sleep again in the afternoon. She disliked the noise of her child, so she entrusted her child to Li Binhua, a thirteen-year-old neighbor, to watch. She paid one dime for watching for two hours, and even hired someone else to wash the child's diapers, three cents for a large diaper and two cents for a small one.
　　The street's great debate began. Everyone discussed building the country and managing the household through diligence and thrift every day. Zhao Zongying still ate her fill and slept soundly. Chen Yeping, a street cadre and also her good friend, talked to her about the situation of the street rectification campaign and the principles of managing the household through diligence and thrift. Later, she was persuaded and mobilized by Chen Yeping to attend meetings. The neighbors in the courtyard gradually started talking to her. Everyone was determined to help her transform. On the one hand, they enthusiastically helped her with some work, and on the other hand, they kept telling her the importance of managing the household through diligence and thrift. In addition to the education she received in the residents' group meetings, she began to examine her own thinking of looking down on labor and not working for nothing. She also began to pay attention to saving in her daily life, gradually going from not borrowing money to having extra money. Seeing that she was beginning to transform, the neighbors kept encouraging her. She also felt that people looked up to her, and she gradually had the confidence to transform herself. During the three-day blitz to eliminate sparrows, her child was suffering from measles. Before dawn, the neighbors heard her child crying desperately. They entered the room but did not see Zhao Zongying. Later, they learned that she had gone to the roof to kill sparrows as early as three o'clock. The neighbor's coal dust was not cleaned up for a long time. When there was a windy day, the courtyard was full of coal dust. She suggested making the coal dust into coal balls. The owner found it troublesome, so she started to do it herself. Before long, the yard was full of coal balls.
　　Mom's Big-Character Poster
　　Jia Ruiqing, an old lady at No. 31, Jiajia Lane, Xiguan, Xi'an City, heard that posting big-character posters was the most effective way to help cadres overcome their shortcomings. She posted two big-character posters in a row for her son, Jie Weisheng. She posted big-character posters for her son, not because she disliked that her son was not filial, nor because she disliked that her son did not do household chores well, but to criticize him for "being a grassroots cadre, often not attending meetings, not being active in social work, and not contacting the masses..."
　　After reading his mother's big-character poster, Jie Weisheng was deeply moved. On the one hand, he was proud to have such a mother; on the other hand, he regretted not doing a good job in street work in the past. He made a self-criticism to the masses and put forward a guarantee to do a good job in the future in a big-character poster. Recently, he has not only helped the masses write big-character posters every day, but also helped the election work team write voter lists. One night, in order to formulate a proposal for street residents, he worked until dawn. When the old lady Jia Ruiqing heard the masses in her lane praising Jie Weisheng for his active work, she couldn't help but smile. Her long-cherished wish was finally fulfilled.

　　新人物  新思想  新风尚
　　戒指的故事
    上海市立第四女子中学学生徐兰君，家里有父母姐妹四人，生活并不富裕。有一天徐兰君放学回家，在房前同里弄青年一起栽树的时候，忽然在泥土中看到一个金晃晃的东西，原来是一只鸭蛋形的金戒指。徐兰君当时曾为这个意外的收获而高兴起来，她把戒指擦干净，准备留在自己身边。晚上，徐兰君的姐姐（共青团员）知道妹妹拾到一只戒指，就对她说，“你是少先队员，拾到东西要交还失主。”母亲也对她说：“现在是新社会，整风以后人人思想更好了，我们再穷也不能把别人的东西留作自己用。”徐兰君一听，想到过去自己掉了钢笔非常难过，那么人家掉了戒指不是更要难过吗？自己小时候也曾把拾到的人民币交给民警，现在人大了，大家又在整风，更不能有这种坏行为，于是，她就把戒指托母亲交给民警处理。
    第二天早晨，民警高祥拿着戒指在附近居民中访问，发现徐兰君的邻居周梅香在十二年前被孩子丢失的戒指同这只戒指完全一样。但当高祥把戒指还给工人家属周梅香时，她怎么也不肯要，说：“这是整风的功劳，应该把戒指献给国家。”由于民警再三说服，周梅香只好收下戒指。最后她同丈夫商量决定，又把戒指兑了现钱，全部用来购买了公债。这是她解放以来第一次买的公债。
    赵宗莹的转变
    进了北京横街三十二号院子，看见赵宗莹正在纳鞋底，身旁坐着三岁的女儿，脚上穿着崭新的紫红灯蕊绒单鞋，院子里一条长长的绳子上，晒着洗出不久的床单、衣服、孩子的尿布……。
    做鞋子、洗衣服，对一个家庭妇女来说，本来是一件极为普通的事情，但对赵宗莹说来，却是整风后才开始的劳动。从前，赵宗莹每天睡觉要睡到快中午的时候才起床，一起来就给自己准备饭，每天不吃鱼就吃肉，还要吃小站米饭，饱吃一顿以后，下午还要睡觉。她嫌孩子吵，就把孩子委托邻居十三岁的李彬华看着，看两个钟头给一毛钱的工资，甚至孩子的尿布都雇别人洗，大的三分钱，小的二分钱。
    街道大辩论开始了，大家天天讨论勤俭建国、勤俭持家，赵宗莹照样是吃饱饭蒙头大睡。邻居陈野萍是街道干部，也是她较好的朋友，就对她谈街道整风的情形，谈勤俭持家的道理。以后经陈野萍说服动员她去开会。院里的邻居逐渐和她讲起话来，大家决心帮助她改造，就一方面热情地帮她做点活，还不断地给她讲勤俭持家的重要。加上居民小组会讨论中给她的教育，她开始检查自己轻视劳动不劳而获的思想，并且开始在日常生活中注意节约，慢慢从不借钱到有余钱。街房们看到她开始转变，不断鼓励她，她也感到人们看得起她了，逐渐有了改造自己的信心。在三天突击消灭麻雀的运动中，她的孩子正出麻疹，天不亮邻居听见她的孩子拼命地哭，走进房里却不见赵宗莹，后来才晓得她三点多钟就上房顶打麻雀去了。隔壁邻家的煤沫子老不清理，遇到刮风天，满院煤灰，她建议把煤沫子做成煤球，主人嫌麻烦，于是她便动起手来，不大会工夫，院里摆满了一摊煤球。
　　妈妈的大字报
    西安市西关介家巷三十一号贾瑞卿老太太听说贴大字报是帮助干部克服缺点的最有效的方法，就连续给她的儿子介未生贴了两张大字报。她给儿子贴大字报，不是嫌儿子不孝顺，也不是嫌儿子不好好做家里的事情，而是批评他“身为基层干部，经常不参加会议，对社会工作不积极，不联系群众……”。
    介未生看了妈妈的大字报后，深受感动。他一方面为自己有这样一个母亲自豪；另一方面也为自己过去没有做好街巷工作而悔恨。他向群众作了检讨，并用大字报提出搞好今后工作的保证。最近，他每天不但帮助群众写大字报，还帮助普选工作队写选民榜。一天晚上，为了制订街巷居民倡议书，他一直工作到天快亮。当贾瑞卿老太太听到本巷群众表扬介未生工作积极时，她情不自禁地笑了起来。多日来的心愿终于达到了。
