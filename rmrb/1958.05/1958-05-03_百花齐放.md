    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    28. Poinsettia
    If someone denies, saying we are leaves, not flowers;
    We can confidently tell him face to face:
    Yes, you are absolutely right, don't be surprised,
    All flowers are actually transformations of leaves.
    (Note) If we say maple leaves are flowers, can you object? The poet said long ago: "Frosty leaves are redder than February flowers." Besides, our red is truly worthy of being called Poinsettia, we are red in the cold winter when all flowers have withered.
    (Note) Flowers evolve from leaves, this is the natural law first revealed by the poet Goethe. Goethe was one of the forerunners of the theory of evolution.

    29. Hyacinth
    People casually call us "foreign daffodils,"
    We must lodge a serious protest.
    We have had Chinese nationality for many years,
    Why add the word "foreign"?
    Chinese compatriots, Chinese folks,
    Please don't call us "foreign" anymore!
    Our flowers are five-colored and fragrant,
    We want to bloom for the spring of socialism.

    30. *Cephalaria*
    Don't think it's about architecture,
    We boldly bloom on the pillars.
    Our stems are thick, leaves are thick, and flowers are simple,
    The refined people think we are not elegant enough.
    But we want to blow the horn for the workers and peasants,
    The Great Leap Forward always needs great energy.
    We do like one traditional Chinese painter,
    Who boldly painted us into traditional Chinese paintings.

    31. Pansy
    Our parent species is *Viola*, namely milk vetch,
    The flower shape is larger, called pansy.
    We also have cold-resistant species in Moscow,
    The temperature drops below zero, but we are not afraid of the cold.
    It can be seen that plants can be changed in many ways,
    So it is only natural that there are many variants of goldfish.
    Can't people change themselves?
    No problem, the key is labor and exercise.

    32. Milk Vetch
    Although we are insignificant among herbaceous flowers,
    Our flower color is the representative of purple.
    European poets sometimes sing about us,
    But Chinese poets seem to be too proud.
    It's no wonder, some can't even distinguish beans from wheat,
    Some will draw branches on lotus stems.
    Striding high and wide like a group of Bactrian camels,
    How can they see the small grass on the side of the road in their eyes.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    28一品红
    如果有人否认，说我们是叶不是花；
    我们可以理直气壮地正面告诉他：
    是的，你说得一点也不错，不要惊讶，
    一切的花其实都是叶子之所变化。
    （注）我们要说枫叶是花你能反对吗？诗人早就说过：“霜叶红于二月花。”何况我们的红真真算得一品红，我们是红在万花雕谢了的寒冬。
    （注）花是由叶子进化而成，这是诗人歌德最初揭发的自然规律。歌德是进化论的前驱者之一。
    29  风信子
    人们乱叫我们为“洋水仙”，
    我们要提出严重的抗议。
    入中国的国籍已经有多年，
    为什么还要加上一个“洋”字？
    中国的同胞，中国的老乡，
    请不要再喊我们是什么“洋”！
    我们的花五色而有清香，
    要为社会主义的春天开放。
    30  柱头花
    不要认为是建筑上的话，
    在柱头上也公然要开花。
    我们的茎粗、叶厚、花简单，
    雅人们看起来不够潇洒。
    但我们要为工农们吹喇叭，
    生产大跃进就总要劲头大。
    我们倒喜欢有一位国画家，
    大胆地把我们画入了国画。
    31  三色蓳
    我们的母种是蓳，即紫云英，
    花型变大了，被称为三色蓳。
    我们在莫斯科还有耐寒种，
    温度降到零下，但也不怕冷。
    可见草木都有办法加以改变，
    金鱼的变种很多也理所当然。
    难道人就不能够改变自己吗？
    没有问题，关键是在劳动锻炼。
    32  紫云英
    在草花中我们虽然是微不足道，
    但我们的花色却是紫色的代表。
    欧洲的诗人有时还肯歌咏我们，
    中国的诗人却似乎性情太高傲。
    也难怪，有的连菽麦都不能辨认，
    有的在荷花梗上也会画出枝条。
    高视阔步就好像一群双峰骆驼，
    眼睛中哪会看得上路旁的小草。
