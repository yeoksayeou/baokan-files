　　Big Stick Policy
    The people of Venezuela welcomed U.S. Vice President Nixon with unprecedented "grandeur," scaring him so much that he scurried into the U.S. embassy in Caracas and dared not show his face. He prayed that he would soon be able to "safely reach Washington."
    With Nixon embarrassed in Caracas, the U.S. Department of Defense immediately announced that it had dispatched four companies of Marines and paratroopers to U.S. bases, ready to go to "protect" the Vice President. The American bully once again brandished the big stick, thinking that the people of Latin American countries could be intimidated.
    The U.S. ruling clique's idea is a bit too naive. Such military demonstrations and interventions have happened many times. The people of Latin American countries are not unaware that when they chased Nixon with spit and stones, they were also expressing their contempt and disdain for the American "big stick" policy.

　　大棒政策
    委内瑞拉的人民以空前的“盛况”迎接了美国副总统尼克松，吓得他抱头鼠窜，钻进加拉加斯的美国大使馆内不敢露头了。他祷告着说，希望不久能够“安全地到达华盛顿”。
    尼克松受窘在加拉加斯，美国国防部立即宣布：已派出四连海军陆战队和伞兵开赴美国基地，准备前去“保护”副总统。美国恶霸又一次挥起大棒，认为拉丁美洲各国人民是能吓唬倒的。
    美国统治集团的想法未免太天真了。这种军事示威和干涉已经发生过多次了，拉丁美洲各国人民并不是不知道，他们用唾沫和石头追赶着尼克松的时候，同样地也是对美国的“大棒”政策表示了轻视和蔑视。
