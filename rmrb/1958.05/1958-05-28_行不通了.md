　　It Doesn't Work Anymore

　　The Adenauer government, which has stubbornly closed its eyes and refused to recognize the German Democratic Republic, recently sent representatives to discuss the issue of utilizing the Elbe River waterway with the government of the German Democratic Republic, which it considers "non-existent." According to the "New York Times," this is the first time since the establishment of the West German government that talks have been held between the East and West German governments.

　　Originally, the West German government wanted to invoke its policy of non-recognition, and have a private company negotiate with the German Democratic Republic. This was rejected, and the German Democratic Republic insisted on government-to-government negotiations. In the end, the West German government had no choice but to accept the suggestion of the German Democratic Republic government and send three representatives to discuss it.

　　In the past, the West German government desperately tried to obliterate the existence of the German Democratic Republic and hinder the expansion of its influence internationally and within Germany. But the result is that the German Democratic Republic exists and continues to grow stronger, and its influence both internationally and domestically is constantly expanding. Now, even the West German government has to deal with the German Democratic Republic government. This shows that the Adenauer government's ostrich policy of stubbornly refusing to recognize reality no longer works.

    行不通了
    一直闭起眼睛死不承认德意志民主共和国的阿登纳政府，最近却派了代表跟它所认为“不存在”的民主德国政府讨论起利用易北河航道的问题来了。据“纽约时报”说，这还是西德政府成立以来第一次在东西德政府之间举行的会谈。
    原先西德政府还想要起它的不承认政策，要一个私人公司和民主德国去谈判。结果遭到拒绝，民主德国坚持要由双方政府进行商谈。最后西德政府没有办法，只有接受民主德国政府的建议，派了三个代表来讨论了。
    过去西德政府拼命想抹煞民主德国的存在，阻挠它在国际上和德国内部影响的扩大。但是结果是民主德国存在着并且不断发展壮大，它在国际和国内的影响也日益扩大。现在连西德政府也不得不跟民主德国政府打起交道来。这说明阿登纳政府的那种死不承认现实的驼鸟政策已经是行不通了。
