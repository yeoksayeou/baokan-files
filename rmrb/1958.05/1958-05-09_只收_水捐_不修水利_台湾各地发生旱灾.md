Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 8th. Taiwan newspapers report that droughts are occurring in various parts of Taiwan. Most of the farmland is cracked due to lack of irrigation water, and the seedlings are gradually withering.

The Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan only collects "water donations" and only pays lip service to farmland water conservancy construction. Of the existing 876,000 hectares of cultivated land in Taiwan, more than half is either completely or largely lacking irrigation water. Once there is a drought, disasters occur. Many farmers in Zhongli Township, Taoyuan County, cannot afford to eat and have become famine victims due to years of drought. The Chiang Kai-shek clique not only fails to provide disaster relief, but also intensifies its efforts to collect so-called "water conservancy fees" from poor farmers in drought-stricken areas.

    只收“水捐”不修水利
    台湾各地发生旱灾
    据新华社广州8日电　台湾报纸报道，目前台湾各地发生旱灾，大部分农田由于缺水灌溉而龟裂，禾苗逐渐枯死。
    蒋介石集团在台湾只会收“水捐”，对农田水利建设是光说不做。在台湾现有耕地面积八十七万六千多公顷中，有一半以上是全部或大部分缺乏灌溉用水的。一遇天旱，就发生灾情。桃园县中?镇许多农民因为连年遭受旱灾，现在已经吃不上饭，成为饥民。蒋介石集团不但不进行救灾，反而加紧在旱灾区向贫苦农民催缴所谓“水利费”。
