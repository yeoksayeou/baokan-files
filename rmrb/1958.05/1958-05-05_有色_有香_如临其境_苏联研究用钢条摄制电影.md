Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 4th: Soviet filmmakers and scientists are researching a type of film that doesn't use film stock but is instead shot on steel strips. This film will be colorful, fragrant, and the screen will be changeable, with a level of realism that will make viewers feel truly immersed in the world depicted in the movie.

The colors in this film will be exactly like natural colors, whether it's a person's face, the color of flowers, the expressions of living things, or the features of nature, all will be vividly reproduced. The film's stereophonic sound will be superior to existing widescreen and panoramic films. The sound will not only come from a certain direction, but will emanate from above, below, left, and right of the actors on screen. Of particular interest is that, in addition to color and stereophonic sound, this film will also give people other sensations. For example, when the film shows a spring garden in full bloom, the audience will not only be able to smell the fragrance of various flowers, but also feel the gentle caress of a flower-scented breeze. This is achieved through specially engineered electronic effects.

Because the film is shot on stainless steel strips, it is not easily damaged and will not burn as easily as film stock. Its screen can change its size according to the picture, unlike current screens that are fixed in size and position.

The research and development of this film is being conducted by a group of people from the Moscow Film Studio and the All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Cinematography. Although this film is still in the research stage, based on the Soviet Union's technological progress and the level of scientific development in various sectors, people believe that this film will be able to meet audiences in the near future.

    有色  有香  如临其境
    苏联研究用钢条摄制电影
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联电影工作者和科学家正在研究一种不用胶卷而用钢条摄制的电影。这种电影有色、有香，银幕可以变动，其逼真程度能使观众感到真正处身于电影反映的境界之中。
    这种电影的色彩将同自然彩色完全一样，无论是人的面孔、鲜花的颜色、生物神态和自然风貌都无不栩栩如生。电影的立体声将比现有的宽银幕电影和全景电影都高明，声音不光是来自某一方向，而是镜头上演员的上下左右都能发出声音。特别引人兴趣的是，除了彩色和立体声外，这种电影还能给人其他感觉。例如，当影片映出百花盛开的春天的花园时，观众不仅可以闻到各种花朵的香味，而且能感到带着花香的微风的轻拂。这是用特殊技术调节而成的电子效果。
    由于电影摄在不锈钢制的钢条上，这种电影不易损坏，也不会像胶卷那样容易烧掉。它的银幕可以根据画面的情况而改变它的大小，不像现在银幕大小位置都固定不变。
    研究试制这种电影的是莫斯科电影制片厂和全苏电影摄影科学研究所的一批人员。虽然这种电影还处在研究阶段，但根据苏联的技术进步和各部门科学发展的水平，人们相信，这种电影在不久将来就可以同观众见面。
