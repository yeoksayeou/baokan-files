Since the Second National Congress of Highway Transportation Workers proposed the slogan "Safety, Economy, 200,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" in February this year, according to incomplete statistics, the number of vehicles that have traveled 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul has reached 858, and there are 16 vehicles with over 300,000 kilometers. Bai Baohua of the Beijing Public Transport Company has set a new national record of over 432,000 kilometers without major overhaul. What is even more gratifying is that workers in various regions have made many efforts to achieve the goal of the entire fleet collectively reaching 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul. For example, the Jies [ZIS] motorcade of the Guizhou State-owned Second Farm has a total of 72 vehicles, of which 62 have reached 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul; the diesel vehicle team of the Hengyang Highway Transportation Bureau in Hunan Province has a total of 80 vehicles, of which 75 have reached 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul; Guangzhou Second Automobile Company has a total of 105 vehicles, of which 43 have reached 200,000 kilometers without major overhaul.

The achievements in safety and economy are also significant. Vehicle fuel consumption has been reduced time and time again, and tire mileage has also greatly improved. In the first quarter alone, 1,200 tires were saved.

Automobile repair and road maintenance workers have also actively participated in this campaign, powerfully promoting its development. They have used old materials to improve machinery and tools, shortening the time vehicles spend in the factory while ensuring quality. According to incomplete statistics, the value of savings from rationalization proposals and improved tools has reached more than 268,000 yuan. In the past, it took seventeen or eighteen days to overhaul a vehicle, but now the Jianyang Repair Factory in Fujian has set a new record of overhauling a vehicle in five hours and four minutes. Vehicle maintenance man-hours have also been greatly reduced. For example, the Guangdong Province's second-level maintenance man-hour quota is four hours, but now it only takes twelve minutes, a 95% reduction compared to the original. Currently, Sichuan Province has reduced the major overhaul quota to two to three days, an 88.23% reduction compared to the original.

    八百多辆汽车20万公里无大修
    本报讯　自今年2月全国公路运输职工二次代表大会提出开展“安全、节约、二十万公里无大修”的口号后，到目前为止，据不完全统计，行驶二十万公里无大修的汽车已达八百五十八辆，三十万公里以上有十六辆。北京市公共汽车公司白宝华则创造了四十三万二千多公里无大修的全国最高纪录。更令人高兴的是，各地职工为争取实现整个车队集体达到二十万公里无大修作了很多努力。如贵州国营二场吉斯车队共有七十二辆车，已有六十二辆达到二十万公里无大修；湖南省衡阳公路运输局柴油汽车队共八十辆车，已有七十五辆达到二十万公里无大修；广州市第二汽车公司共有汽车一百零五辆，已有四十三辆车达到二十万公里无大修。
    安全、节约的成绩也很大，汽车用油一次一次的降低，轮胎行驶里程也大大提高，仅第一季度节约的轮胎就有一千二百条。
    汽车修理和养路工人也纷纷投入这个运动，有力地推动了运动的发展。他们利用旧料改进机具，在保证质量的情况下，缩短在厂车日。据不完全统计，合理化建议和改进工具的节约价值已达二十六万八千多元。过去大修一辆汽车要十七八天，现在，福建建阳修理厂创造了五小时零四分钟大修一辆汽车的新纪录。汽车保养工时也大大降低，如广东省二级保养工时定额为四小时，现只用十二分钟，比原来降低了95％，目前四川省已将大修定额降低到二天至三天，比原来降低88.23％。
