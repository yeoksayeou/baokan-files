Xinhua News Agency, 29th. China's pharmaceutical industry sector is determined to break the ideological shackles of imitation and propose a new guideline of "starting from the health of 600 million people, creatively developing the pharmaceutical industry, and letting China's pharmaceutical industry shine in the world." It is also taking many measures to change the backward state of the pharmaceutical industry and ensure that China gradually becomes one of the most hygienic countries in the world.

China possesses a rich pharmaceutical heritage. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Chinese medicine practitioners have been weapons for our people to fight against diseases for thousands of years. Currently, many intractable diseases that cannot be cured by Western medicine can often be cured by TCM. For example, for type B encephalitis, for which there is no specific Western medicine, the cure rate of TCM reaches over 80%. As for folk remedies for treating snake venom, leprosy, high blood pressure, and lymphatic tuberculosis, they are even more common. Inheriting and developing China's scientific heritage can not only better serve the health of 600 million people, but also make great contributions to the world's pharmaceutical science. During the First Five-Year Plan, China's pharmaceutical industry made great achievements. The total output value of the pharmaceutical industry in 1957 increased by four and a half times compared with 1952. Of the 400 common Western medicines that were almost entirely dependent on imports before liberation, about half can now be manufactured domestically. However, in the past, the pharmaceutical industry sector did not fully recognize the significance of developing TCM. They believed that those engaged in Western medicine did not need to concern themselves with TCM. Some effective TCM remedies were not researched domestically, and only after foreigners learned them were they then learned back from abroad. During the rectification campaign, this bourgeois ideology of blindly worshiping foreign countries was severely criticized. A large number of facts made the staff of the pharmaceutical industry sector realize that to achieve a leap forward in the pharmaceutical industry, it is necessary to eliminate the idea of valuing Western medicine over Chinese medicine, promote the spirit of originality, and implement a policy of giving equal importance to both TCM and Western medicine.

Now, based on this spirit, they have formulated preliminary plans for organizing factories and research institutions to learn from TCM, study and summarize effective TCM prescriptions, and investigate medicinal plants in various regions. For example, wild plants such as *Rauvolfia verticillata* , which has been preliminarily proven to treat high blood pressure, *cat's claw*, which treats lymphatic tuberculosis, and *Centipeda minima*, which treats sinusitis, have all been included in the research plan. Among them, successful research on *Rauvolfia verticillata* can be used to replace the imported famous drug Serpasil. Other effective folk remedies will also be sorted and researched. For TCM medicines such as musk and tiger bones that are currently in short supply, appropriate substitutes will be trialed.

The research and experimentation of Western medicine should also break away from the circle of the 400 commonly used medicines in various countries. By 1959, in addition to successfully trial-manufacturing all commonly used medicines in the world, it is also necessary to mobilize pharmaceutical research forces in all aspects to find new medicines for diseases that currently have no effective medicines internationally and for endemic diseases such as Keshan disease and Kashin-Beck disease. Research should also be conducted on contraceptives that are highly effective and easy to use. The dosage of medicines and pills that are not suitable for the physique of the Chinese people should be appropriately changed; some translated drug names that are difficult for some Chinese people to identify are also being prepared to be changed.

Recently, pharmaceutical factories and research institutions have accelerated the pace of research and trial production. Vitamins such as Vitamin B12 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, neomycin for the treatment of infantile enteritis, tetracycline and oxytetracycline, which have similar effects to chlortetracycline but fewer side effects, have been successfully tested. A new antibiotic, actinomycin K, recently found in the soil, has been preliminarily tested to have the effect of treating cancer.

The pharmaceutical industry sector is also researching and manufacturing medicines and veterinary drugs to support agricultural production and promote livestock growth. According to experiments, adding a small amount of chlortetracycline to pig feed can make pigs grow faster, get sick less often, and the meat tastes more delicious. Spraying mulberry leaves with diluted penicillin solution to raise silkworms can increase the survival rate of silkworms by 10% and increase the amount of silk produced by 10% to 40%. Now, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Guangdong and other places have begun preparations to build livestock chlortetracycline factories, and other regions are also preparing to build them successively. Pharmaceutical factories in the Southwest, Shanghai, Wuhan and other places have also separately undertaken the task of researching and manufacturing veterinary drugs for treating hog cholera, fowl plague, and sheep scabies.

    打破“厚西薄中”的思想枷锁  创造性地发展我国医药工业
    医药工业部门确定跃进方针
    新华社29日讯　我国医药工业部门决心打破因袭模仿的思想枷锁，提出“从六亿人民的健康出发，创造性地发展医药工业，让中国医药工业在世界上大放异彩”的新方针，并且采取许多措施来改变医药工业的落后面貌，保证使中国逐步成为世界上最卫生的国家之一。
    我国拥有丰富的医药遗产。中药和中医同是我国人民几千年来和疾病进行斗争的武器，目前许多西药不能医治的疑难杂症，往往中药可以治好。比如目前没有对症西药的乙型脑炎，中药治愈率却达到80％以上。至于民间流传的医治蛇毒、麻疯、高血压、淋巴腺结核的单方更是屡见不鲜。承继和发扬我国这一科学遗产，不仅可以更好地为六亿人民的保健事业服务，而且可以对世界医药科学作出巨大贡献。第一个五年计划期间，我国医药工业取得了很大成绩，1957年医药工业总产值比1952年增加了四倍半，解放前绝大部分依赖进口的四百种通用西药，目前已经有一半左右可以自己制造。但是，过去医药工业部门对发展中药的重大意义却认识不足，认为搞西药的不必过问中药，有些行之有效的中药自己不研究，等到外国人学去了，才又从外国学回来。整风中，这种盲目崇拜外国的资产阶级思想受到了严格的批判，大量的事实使医药工业部门的工作人员认识到，要实现医药工业的飞跃发展，必须破除厚西薄中思想，发扬独创精神，实行中西药并举的方针。
    现在，他们已经根据这一精神订出了组织工厂和研究机构向中医学习，研究与总结中药特效处方和调查各地药用植物的初步规划。像已经初步证明可以治疗高血压的野生植物萝芙木、治淋巴腺结核的猫爪草、治鼻窦炎的鹅不食草，都已列入了研究计划。其中萝芙木研究成功后可以用来代替进口名药寿比南使用。对于流传民间其他有效的药方，也将整理研究。像麝香、虎骨等目前供应不足的中药，要试制适当的代用品。
    西药的研究试验也要跳出各国常用药四百种的圈子。到1959年，除了要把世界上常用药全部试制成功以外，还要动员各方面的医药研究力量，为目前国际上还没有特效药可医的疾病和克山病、柳拐子病等地方病，寻找新的药品。对于效用高、使用方便的避孕药也要进行研究。对于不适合中国人民体质的药针药片的剂量，要适当加以改变；某些中国人难于辨识的翻译药名也准备更改。
    最近各制药厂和研究机构都已加快了研究试制的步伐。像治疗恶性贫血的维他命B12，治疗小儿肠炎的新霉素、疗效与金霉素相仿而副作用小的四圜素和土霉素等抗生素都相继试验成功。不久前从土壤中找到的一种新的抗生素——放线菌素K，经过初步试验有治疗癌症的效能。
    医药工业部门还为支援农业生产促进牲畜生长而研究制造药品和兽药。据试验，在猪饲料中加入少许金霉素，可以使猪长得快，少生病，肉味也更鲜美。用稀释的青霉素溶液喷桑叶养蚕，蚕的成活率可以提高10％，出丝量也能增加10％到40％。现在北京、内蒙古、湖北、广东等地都已着手筹建畜用金霉素工厂，其他地区也准备陆续兴建。西南、上海、武汉等地的药厂也都分别担任了研究制造医治猪瘟、鸡瘟、羊癣等兽药的任务。
