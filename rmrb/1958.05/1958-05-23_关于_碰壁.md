    On "Hitting a Wall"
    Bai Dongqiao
    People often describe suffering a setback in their work as "hitting a wall." "Hitting a wall" is often a turning point in a person's thoughts and emotions. Therefore, correctly understanding the problem of "hitting a wall" is even more important in the socialist construction where ten thousand horses gallop forward and old rules and old methods are constantly being革新.
    The reasons for "hitting a wall" are diverse, but ultimately, there is only one: that subjective understanding does not conform to objective reality. Simple and crude methods will inevitably hit a wall in the face of complex things; but backward conservatism and clinging to the old will also hit a wall in the face of new things. The root of both is the same: the failure to fully understand objective things. Therefore, subjective one-sidedness is the main cause of hitting a wall. Only by correctly recognizing this point can one absorb the lessons of "hitting a wall," gain experience, correct one's mistakes, and strive forward, making oneself stronger and more capable. This is the true path. But regrettably, some people clearly understand these principles, but when faced with the actual problem of "hitting a wall," they often lose their reason and, instead of deeply digging into the roots of their subjective thoughts, attribute the cause of "hitting a wall" entirely to objective factors. Such a light and breezy dismissal will not improve one's thinking, and errors will naturally not be overcome. The "wall" will continue to be "hit" forever, and the hits will become heavier and heavier. Over time, the decadent and passive "small comfort mentality" of "seeking no merit, but seeking no fault" will naturally arise.
    Some time ago, when energetic people were launching a major offensive against the three winds and five airs, an older person said to a young person behind his back: "My pushing, procrastination, and languor in work are the result of many setbacks. You people may become even more severe in the future." This statement is completely wrong. The basic reason for the error is too much faith in the role of objective factors. Work is complex, with the joy of success and the pain of failure and setbacks. If you have a correct stand and viewpoint, then these "setbacks" will make the weak strong; conversely, they will make the strong weak and passive. The key lies in the individual's thinking, not in objective factors.
    Human understanding has limitations, so "hitting a wall" has a certain degree of inevitability. However, if we strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, practice again, improve again, study again... for those who aspire to this, the phenomenon of "hitting a wall" will be greatly reduced or even completely overcome.
    "Hitting a wall" is not a good phenomenon. We do not want to hit it, but we are never afraid of it. It is also our negative teacher.

### 关于“碰壁”

    关于“碰壁”
　　白东桥
    人们通常把在工作中吃了败仗说成是“碰壁”。“碰壁”常常是一个人的思想情绪的转折点。因此，正确认识“碰壁”的问题，在万马奔腾、旧规章、旧方法不断被革新的社会主义建设中更有其重要的意义。
    “碰壁”的原因是多种多样的，但归根结蒂却只有一条，即：主观认识不符合客观实际。方法简单粗暴必然会在复杂的事物面前碰壁；但落后保守，抱残守缺也会在新事物面前碰壁。这两者的根源同样是没有充分认识客观事物。所以，主观片面是造成碰壁的主要原因。只要正确认识了这一点，才会吸收“碰壁”的教训，取得经验，矫正自己的错误，奋发前进，使自己更坚强，更干练。这是真正的道路。但是令人遗憾的是有些人明明懂得这些道理，但一遇到“碰壁”的实际问题，往往就失去了理智，不去深刻地挖自己主观思想的根，却把造成“碰壁”的原因一古脑推给客观。这样轻飘飘地一划而过，思想自然不会提高，错误自然克服不了，“壁”也会永远“碰”下去，而且会越碰越重。久而久之，“不求有功、但求无过”的颓废消极的“小康思想”就自然产生了。
    前些日子，当朝气勃勃的人们大举进攻三风五气的时候，一位年岁不太大的人在背后对一位青年说：“我对工作推、拖、有暮气，是经过许多挫折后变成的，你们这些人说不定将来会比我更厉害。”这种说法是十分错误的。错误的基本原因是太迷信于客观的作用了。工作是复杂的，有成功后的欢欣，也有失败挫折后的痛苦。如果你有正确的立场、观点，那么这“挫折”会使懦弱变得坚强；反之，它会使坚强变得懦弱、消极，关键在于个人的思想而不在于客观。
    人的认识是有局限性的，因此，“碰壁”就带有某种程度的必然性。但是如果加强学习马列主义、再实践、再提高、再学习……有志于此的人，“碰壁”现象是会大大减少以致完全克服的。
    “碰壁”不是好现象，我们不希望碰，但也决不害怕它，它也是我们的反面教师。
