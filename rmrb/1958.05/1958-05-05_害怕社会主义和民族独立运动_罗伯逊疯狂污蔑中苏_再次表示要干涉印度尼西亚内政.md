Xinhua News Agency, 3rd dispatch: Washington - Walter Robertson, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, delivered a speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on May 2, defending the United States' aggressive policies in the Far East, frantically slandering China and the Soviet Union, and attacking Asian national independence movements.

Robertson is still deluding himself by dreaming that the Chinese people's regime "will not last forever." He said that he sees "no benefit for us (the United States) in recognizing China."

Robertson is very concerned about the enormous influence of the peaceful policies pursued by the Soviet Union and China among the Asian people. He believes that the principle of peaceful coexistence "weakens" the United States' military alliances with other countries. Robertson's speech also expressed fear of the anti-colonialist sentiments of the people in independent Asian countries. He said that these countries' "recent colonial experience has left a strong legacy of anti-colonialism and nationalism," and that "this has its disadvantages." He is particularly afraid of the admiration and respect these independent people have for the great achievements of the Soviet Union and China. He said: "The Soviet Union, in a short period of forty years, has transformed itself from a backward agricultural country into a powerful industrial and scientific nation. For the people of less developed countries seeking order, rapid growth, and industrialization, the example of Russia, and even Communist China, is not without appeal."

Robertson said that the primary goal of the United States' Far East policy is to maintain a large military force to deal with China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries.

In his speech, Robertson also made remarks interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs. He reiterated that the U.S. State Department is "deeply disturbed" by the Indonesian rebels' successive defeats and used suggestive language to urge the Indonesian government to compromise with the rebels. He also made unwarranted accusations against the Indonesian people's just demand to recover West Irian.

    害怕社会主义和民族独立运动
    罗伯逊疯狂污蔑中苏
    再次表示要干涉印度尼西亚内政
    据新华社3日讯　华盛顿消息：美国负责远东事务的助理国务卿罗伯逊5月2日在参议院外交委员会发表谈话，为美国在远东的侵略政策辩护，疯狂地污蔑中国和苏联，并且攻击亚洲的民族独立运动。
    罗伯逊至今还在自欺欺人地梦想中国人民政权“不会永远存在下去”。他说，他看不出“我们（美国）能够从承认中国这件事得到任何好处”。
    罗伯逊非常担心苏中两国奉行的和平政策在亚洲人民中间的巨大影响，他认为和平共处的原则“削弱”了美国同其他国家的军事联盟。罗伯逊的谈话也表现了对亚洲独立国家人民的反殖民主义情绪的恐惧。他说，这些国家“不久以前的殖民地经历留下了强烈的反殖民主义情绪和民族主义情绪的遗产”，“这有它不利的地方”。他特别害怕这些独立的人民对苏联和中国所取得的巨大成就的钦佩和景仰。他说：“苏联在短短四十年的时期内已经从一个落后的农业国家变成一个强大的工业和科学国家。对于寻求秩序、迅速成长和工业化的比较不发达的国家的人民来说，俄国的例子，甚至共产党中国的例子并不是没有吸引力的。”
    罗伯逊说，美国远东政策的首要目标就是要保持一支庞大的军事力量来对付中国、苏联和其他社会主义国家。
    罗伯逊在谈话中还发表干涉印度尼西亚内政的论调。他再次表明美国国务院对印度尼西亚叛乱分子节节溃败的局势“深深感到不安”，并且用暗示的口吻要印度尼西亚政府同叛乱分子妥协。他还对印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安的正义要求横加诬蔑。
