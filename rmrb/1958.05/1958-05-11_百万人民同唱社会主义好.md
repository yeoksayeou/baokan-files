　　Millions of People Sing "Socialism is Good" Together
    A mass singing activity with a million people in Nanjing singing about socialism has been widely launched throughout the city. Many factories, schools, streets, and agricultural cooperatives have already resounded with the songs of the masses. The working people of the whole city are singing heroic revolutionary songs, marching towards the great leap forward in production and construction.
    In the Dachangzhen suburban area, the masses in various agricultural cooperatives and factories can now generally sing five songs. Singing has become an indispensable activity during their labor and rest. The elderly men and women among the residents have also organized themselves to compete with the young people in enthusiasm and sing in unison. At present, there are three choirs in Nanjing composed of elderly men and women.

　　百万人民同唱社会主义好
    南京市一个百万人民歌唱社会主义的群众性歌咏活动已在全市普遍展开。许多工厂、学校、街巷以及农业合作社里，都已响起了群众的歌声。全市劳动人民正在高唱着英雄的革命歌曲，向生产建设大进军。
    郊区大厂镇各农业合作社、工厂的群众现在一般都会唱五支歌，唱歌已成为他们劳动和休息时的一项不可缺少的活动。居民中的老大爷、老大娘们也组织起来要和青年人比比干劲，同声歌唱。目前南京市已有三个由老大爷和老大娘组成的合唱队。
