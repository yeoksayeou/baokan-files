Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 8th: The successful night navigation of vessels downstream on the Chongqing to Wanxian section of the Sichuan River has been achieved. The "Jiangwan Wheel," "Changjiang No. 2017 Wheel" (towing three barges), "Youth Wheel" (towing three barges), and "Minjiang Boat" (towing two barges) of the Chongqing Branch of the Yangtze River Shipping Administration have recently navigated safely downstream from Chongqing to Wanxian at night. This is a major innovation in the history of Sichuan River shipping.

The Sichuan River has many dangerous shoals, rapid currents, and a winding, narrow riverbed. When the water level drops, some critical sections of the waterway are only fifty to sixty meters wide and just over two meters deep. The flotillas towing three barges are more than thirty meters wide and more than one hundred meters long. In addition, when the flotilla turns, the sweeping water is very fast, and the speed is difficult to control. During night navigation, sailors adopt the method of "hanging high and taking low" for steering, navigating along shallow water when turning. Channel workers have added a large number of light markers and signal stations and adjusted the position of the light markers.

After the opening of night navigation on the Sichuan River, the voyage period can be shortened, ship turnover can be accelerated, and the port handling capacity can be expanded. According to preliminary statistics, if all Sichuan River vessels carry out downstream night navigation, the annual transportation capacity can be increased by 3,096,000 ton-days, increasing the nation's wealth by more than 3.8 million yuan.

    漏夜下川江
    据新华社重庆8日电　重庆到万县段川江下水夜航已经成功。长江航运管理局重庆分局的“江万轮”、“长江二○一七轮”（拖三驳）、“青年号轮”（拖三驳）和“岷江艇”（拖双驳），最近分别由重庆下水夜航安全到达万县。这是川江航运史上的重大创举。
    川江险滩多，水流湍急，河床弯曲、狭窄。当水位下降的时候，有些险要航段只有五十到六十公尺宽，深两公尺多；而拖三驳的船队宽达三十多公尺，长达一百多公尺，再加上船队转弯时扫弯水很急，航速难于控制，海员们在夜航中采用挂高取矮的驾驶方法，在转弯时沿浅水走。航道工人，增设了大量灯标和信号台，调整了灯标位置。
    川江开放夜航以后，可以缩短航期，加速船舶周转，扩大港口吞吐能力。据初步统计，如果川江船舶全部开展下水夜航，每年可以增加运力三百零九万六千多吨天，为国家增产三百八十多万元的财富。
