Four Rural Children's Songs
Jin Jin

  Wheelbarrow

　　Small carrying pole, bent at both ends,
　　It's hard to carry loads up the mountain,
　　Now the whole village has wheelbarrows,
　　Going up and down the hills is easy.

　　Who makes the wheelbarrows?
　　Everyone is a carpenter,
　　Where are the carts made?
　　Every home is a workshop.
　　The saw goes "jig-a-jig,"
　　The axe goes "crack-bang,"
　　Three days and nights pass quickly,
　　The wheelbarrow defeats the small carrying pole.

  Old Ox

　　Old ox, go to the meadow,
　　I want to learn to use the double-shared plow,
　　The plowshare plows deep,
　　The rice seedlings take root well,
　　The plowshare plows fast,
　　The harvest doubles.
　　New farm tools are all good,
　　The double-shared plow is a treasure.

  Azalea

　　Azaleas, bloom all over the mountain,
　　My sister comes home for Qingming,
　　What does she do when she comes back to her mother's house?
　　She brings a letter to let me guess.

　　Guess to the left, can't guess it,
　　Guess to the right, not right,
　　It turns out to be a letter of challenge,
　　Two cooperatives are about to start a big competition.
　　Our cooperative leader says with a smile:
　　"Let's see who falls behind and becomes a turtle."

  Huangshan Ridge

　　Huangshan Ridge, truly distressed,
　　No trees grow, no grass grows.
　　We line up to go up the mountain,
　　Planting many small saplings,
　　There are bayberries, there are walnuts,
　　And pine trees standing tall.
　　Come and see again in three years,
　　The small trees will definitely be taller than me.

    农村儿歌四首
    金近
  手推车
  小扁担，两头弯，
  挑担上山难又难，
  全乡有了手推车，
  上山下坡就好办。
  谁做手推车？
  人人是木匠，
  车子哪里造？
  家家是工场。
  锯子叽咕叽，
  斧头劈拍响，
  三天三夜过得快，
  手推车打倒小扁担。
  老黄牛
  老黄牛，上草地，
  我要学习双铧犁，
  犁头耕得深，
  秧苗好生根，
  犁头耕得快，
  收成加一倍。
  新式农具样样好，
  双铧犁就是一个宝。
  杜鹃花
  杜鹃花，满山开，
  姐姐清明回家来，
  她回娘家做什么？
  带封信来叫我猜。
  左猜猜不到，
  右猜猜不对，
  原来是封挑战书，
  两个社要展开大竞赛。
  我们社长笑着说：
  “就看谁落在后面做乌龟。”
    黄山冈
  黄山冈，真苦恼，
  不长树木不长草。
  我们排队上山去，
  种下很多小树苗，
  有杨梅，有核桃，
  还有松树挺着腰。
  再过三年来看看，
  小树一定比我高。
