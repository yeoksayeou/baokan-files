Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - TASS reported from Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received the ambassadors of the United States, Britain and France separately on the 5th at the Foreign Ministry and held talks with them on the issue of preparing for the summit meeting. In the process of exchanging opinions with the three ambassadors, Gromyko explained the Soviet government's views on many issues that should be studied at the summit meeting.

Gromyko handed the Soviet government's memorandum to the three ambassadors respectively. This memorandum is a reply to the notes submitted by the governments of the United States, Britain and France on May 3 regarding the convening of a summit meeting.

The Soviet government memorandum, after pointing out that the three governments agreed to the Soviet proposal (that is, the Soviet Foreign Minister would negotiate separately with the ambassadors of each country to exchange opinions in advance on the necessary preparatory work for the foreign ministers' meeting), said that now that the method of exchanging opinions through diplomatic channels has finally been agreed upon, the Soviet Union hopes that all parties will make the necessary efforts to complete this work as soon as possible.

The Soviet government, like the governments of the United States, Britain and France, believes that adopting such a procedure does not in any way predetermine the members who will participate in the future foreign ministers' meeting and summit meeting. At the same time, the Soviet government expressed regret that the three governments did not agree to include representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia in the current stage of preparatory work for the summit meeting.

The Soviet government hopes that the three governments can strive to reach an agreement on holding a foreign ministers' meeting as soon as possible, and that the foreign ministers' meeting should ensure that a summit meeting with the participation of heads of government of all countries is convened as soon as possible.

The Soviet government's memorandum pointed out that the Soviet government does not exclude the possibility of exchanging opinions on certain issues proposed by both parties for inclusion on the agenda of the summit meeting, if necessary and with everyone's agreement, during meetings with ambassadors or during the foreign ministers' meeting. At the same time, the Soviet government also stated that diplomatic negotiations should not relegate the discussion of matters related to organizing the foreign ministers' meeting to a secondary position.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 6th - TASS reported from Moscow: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko received Polish Ambassador Geid and Czechoslovak Ambassador Vosaglik on the 5th, one after the other, and held talks with them.

During the talks, the two sides exchanged views on a series of issues to be discussed at the summit meeting.

    苏联再次促美英法尽快举行外长会议
    主张加速高级会议筹备工作
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯5日在外交部分别接见了美、英、法三国大使，同他们就准备最高级会议问题进行了谈话。葛罗米柯在同三国大使交换意见的过程中，对于在政府首脑会议上应该研究的许多问题说明了苏联政府的看法。
    葛罗米柯把苏联政府的备忘录分别交给三国大使。这次的备忘录是对美、英、法三国政府5月3日就召开最高级会议所提出的照会的答复。
    苏联政府备忘录在指出三国政府同意了苏联的建议（即由苏联外交部长分别同每一个国家的大使谈判，来就外长会议的必要筹备工作预先交换意见）之后说，现在，当终于议定了通过外交途径来交换意见的方式时，苏联希望各方面作必要的努力来尽快地完成这项工作。
    苏联政府和美国、英国和法国政府一样，认为采取这样的程序绝不等于事先就决定了参加未来的外长会议和高级会议的成员。同时，苏联政府对三国政府没有同意吸收波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的代表参加现阶段的最高级会议的筹备工作表示遗憾。
    苏联政府希望，三国政府能够努力就尽快举行外长会议达成协议，而外长会议则应当保证尽快地召开有各国政府首脑参加的高级会议。
    苏联政府的备忘录指出，苏联政府并不排斥在同大使会谈或在外长会议的过程中，必要时可以在大家都同意的情况下，就双方提出列入最高级会议议程上的某些问题交换意见。同时苏联政府也表示，外交谈判不应该把讨论有关组织外长会议的事情推到次要地位。
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯在5日先后接见了波兰大使盖德和捷克斯洛伐克大使沃萨格里克，并且同他们进行了交谈。
    在交谈中，双方就将要在政府首脑会议上讨论的一系列问题交换了意见。
