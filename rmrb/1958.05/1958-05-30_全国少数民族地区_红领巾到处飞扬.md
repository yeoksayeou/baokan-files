    Xinhua News Agency, May 29th: The Young Pioneers organization has greatly developed in national minority areas throughout the country. The number of Young Pioneers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has now reached 500,000, more than four times the number in 1955. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has established Young Pioneer organizations in 1,651 middle and primary schools, with more than 170,000 Young Pioneers of all ethnic groups. Young Pioneer organizations have also been established in many middle and primary schools far away on the Altai Grassland and the Pamir Plateau. The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has universally established Young Pioneers in primary schools, with more than 980,000 Young Pioneers throughout the region. The first groups of Tibetan "Red Scarves" have appeared in Lhasa, Xigaze, Qamdo, Heihe, Gada, and other cities in Tibet. The number of Young Pioneers of the Miao, Buyi, Yi, and Shui ethnic groups in Guizhou has increased nearly eightfold compared to 1955, reaching more than 186,000. In the Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, and Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan, Young Pioneer organizations have been established in most counties. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which had Young Pioneers in rural guerrilla areas during the Anti-Japanese War, now has more than 78,900 Young Pioneers, accounting for about 80% of the children of Young Pioneer age in the prefecture.
    Young Pioneers of all ethnic groups in various regions have universally carried out various activities closely integrated with socialist construction and revolutionary struggles. All Young Pioneers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are using their labor income and saved pocket money to raise funds for the construction of two "Red Scarf" reservoirs. Construction of the first "Red Scarf" reservoir has already begun, and after its completion, this reservoir can irrigate 160,000 mu of land on the Tumochuan Plain. Since this spring, children of all ethnic groups in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture have planted more than 100 million trees, and also planted 3.56 million sunflowers and castor beans, establishing 166 "Red Scarf" forests, 320 "Red Scarf" nurseries, and 47 "Red Scarf" reservoirs. In the shock campaign to eliminate the four pests in Urumqi, Xinjiang, the children eliminated 441 kilograms of flies. Young Pioneers in various parts of Xinjiang also often help nearby agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives with milking, grazing, weeding, and catching insects during team days. Most primary schools in pastoral areas have established small pastures. Young Pioneers of Duogunao Primary School in Li County, Aba Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, have accumulated more than 10,000 jin of fertilizer in their spare time and transported it to the township.
    The team day life of Young Pioneers from ethnic minorities is rich and colorful. In many places in Guizhou, ethnic minority Young Pioneers often learn embroidery and batik under the guidance of ethnic arts and crafts experts, so that children love the art of their ethnic group. Young Pioneers in Tibet often visit nearby factories, farms, and weather stations, and they also often visit the Liberation Army uncles stationed on the border. Many schools in Xinjiang also organize children of all ethnic groups to learn each other's languages, songs, and dances, making the children of all ethnic groups more united and friendly.

    各地少数民族的少先队员普遍开展了与社会主义建设和革命斗争紧密结合的各种活动。内蒙古自治区全体少先队员正在用自己的劳动收入和节省下来的零钱，为兴建两座“红领巾”水库筹集资金。第一座“红领巾”水库已经动工，这座水库建成后可以灌溉土默川平原上的十六万亩土地。延边朝鲜族自治州的各族少年儿童，今春以来共栽树一亿多株，还种了三百五十六万株向日葵和篦麻，建立了一百六十六个“红领巾”林、三百二十个“红领巾”苗圃和四十七座“红领巾”水库。新疆乌鲁木齐市的少年儿童在除四害的突击运动中消灭苍蝇四百四十一公斤。新疆各地的少先队员还经常在队日里帮助附近的农、牧业生产合作社挤奶、放牧、拔草和捉虫，大部分牧区小学建立了小牧场。四川阿坝藏族自治州理县朵谷脑小学的少先队员利用课余时间积肥一万多斤，并把这些肥料运到乡里。
    少数民族少先队员的队日生活是丰富多采的。贵州许多地方的少数民族少先队员，在民族工艺美术能手的辅导下，经常学习刺绣和腊染，使孩子们热爱本民族的艺术。西藏的少先队员常常到附近的工厂、农场、气象站参观，他们也经常拜访驻在边疆的解放军叔叔。新疆的许多学校还组织各族少年儿童互相学习各民族的语言和歌舞，使各族儿童们更加团结友爱。
