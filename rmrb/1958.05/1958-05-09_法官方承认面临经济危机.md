Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 8th: According to TASS, the French newspapers of the 7th paid close attention to the report released by the National Accounting and Economic Budget Committee on the French economic situation last year and the prospects for economic development in 1958-1959. This committee, led by former French Prime Minister Mendès France, is composed of parliamentarians, economists, and senior officials from the Ministry of Finance.

The newspapers' main focus was on the section of the report concerning the prospects for French economic development. This section stated somberly that "restoring France's balance of payments is absolutely necessary," but that due to the Western economic downturn, "solving this problem is even more difficult." In this regard, the report emphasized that "the deepening of the American economic crisis" makes it difficult to expand exports, which is a condition for restoring French economic vitality. Moreover, it "may be the fundamental factor causing economic recession in France at the end of 1958." The report also acknowledged that France's participation in the Western European "Common Market" has had a negative impact on the French economy.

The drafters of the report suggested that this year will be characterized by stagnation of the French economy, while next year will be characterized by "possibly a severe economic recession."

The drafters of the report suggested implementing rationing of consumer goods and freezing wages in order to "generally reduce" domestic consumption. "Liberation" commented on the report, saying: If the Algerian war continues, it will inevitably lead to restrictions on the consumption of alcohol, meat, gasoline, textiles, and other commodities, and a crisis is approaching. Illusions are being shattered.

    法官方承认面临经济危机
    新华社8日讯　据塔斯社巴黎讯：7日的法国报刊十分注意国家计算和经济预算委员会所公布的法国去年经济状况和1958—1959年经济发展前景的报告。由前法国总理孟戴斯—弗朗斯领导的这个委员会，是由议员、经济学家以及财政部高级官员组成的。
    报纸主要的注意力放在报告中关于法国经济发展远景的部分。这部分调子低沉地说，“恢复法国的收支平衡是绝对必要的”，然而，由于西方经济不景气，“解决这个问题就更加困难了”。在这方面，报告强调指出，“美国经济危机的加深”使得出口难于扩大，而这是恢复法国经济元气的条件。不仅如此，它还“可能是造成法国在1958年年底经济衰退的基本因素”。报告还承认，法国的参加西欧“共同市场”对法国经济起了坏影响。
    报告的起草人提出，今年的特点将是法国经济的停滞，而明年的特点“可能是严重的经济衰退”。
    报告的起草人建议实行消费品的配给制和冻结工资，这样来“普遍削减”国内的消费。“解放报”就报告发表评论说：如果阿尔及利亚战争还要继续，那就不可避免地要限制酒类、肉类、汽油、纺织品和其他商品的消费，危机正在迫近。幻想正在破灭。
