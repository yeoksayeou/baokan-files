    Sending to Chang'e
    Wang Kunlun

    When the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite ascended to the heavens, I expressed my joy in verse. Now, scientists have pointed out a landing site on the moon. I send this poem to Chang'e, first expressing my welcome, using the same rhyme scheme as before.
    The warmth of the human world surpasses the cold emptiness.
    Cloud carriages have long been prepared to descend from the lunar palace.
    Please arrange a landing spot for me.
    Please come and see the revolutionary winds.
    The medicinal rabbit is building a specialized factory.
    Wu Gang in forestry is planting ten thousand pines.
    Please trouble the streets with more beautiful dances.
    The white swan is trying to compete as a pioneer [Note]

    [Note] The Beijing Dance School has mastered the "Swan Lake" ballet.
