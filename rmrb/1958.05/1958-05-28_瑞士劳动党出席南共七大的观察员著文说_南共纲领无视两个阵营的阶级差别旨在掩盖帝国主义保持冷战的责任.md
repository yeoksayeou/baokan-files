Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 24th. The Swiss newspaper "Voice of Labor" recently published an article by Paul Stotz, an observer from the Swiss Labor Party attending the Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, entitled "The Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia."

In the article, Stotz said that the declaration issued by the twelve communist parties in Moscow in November 1957 pointed out the basic truths of universal value to all communist and workers' parties, but the LCY program gave a completely different explanation of the developments in recent years.

After quoting the draft LCY program's statement on the origin of the two major military blocs in the world, Stotz wrote: This is a bizarre statement. According to this statement, the Soviet Union is condemned along with the United States for pursuing a policy of dividing the world into spheres of influence, disregarding the interests of the people of all countries. If such an "explanation" is accepted, neither of the current camps proceeds from class interests, and what people oppose is merely two imperialisms attempting to seize world hegemony. The conclusion drawn from this is that the people of all countries should distrust them and stay away from them.

Stotz pointed out that in this way, the draft LCY program, while covering up imperialism's full responsibility for maintaining the Cold War, viciously slandered the first worker-peasant state in the world, without considering its constant pursuit of a peaceful policy, undermined the trust that workers should have in this peaceful policy, and promoted the division of socialist forces. The unity and fraternal cooperation of socialist forces are a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and ensuring progress towards socialism.

### 瑞士劳动党出席南共七大的观察员著文说  南共纲领无视两个阵营的阶级差别旨在掩盖帝国主义保持冷战的责任

    瑞士劳动党出席南共七大的观察员著文说
    南共纲领无视两个阵营的阶级差别旨在掩盖帝国主义保持冷战的责任
    新华社日内瓦24日电　瑞士“工人之声报”最近发表了瑞士劳动党出席南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会的观察员保罗·施托茨所写的题目是“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟代表大会”的文章。
    施托茨在文章中说，1957年11月十二国共产党在莫斯科发表的宣言指出了对所有共产党和工人党有普遍价值的基本真理，可是南共纲领却对最近这些年来的事态发展作出完全不同的解释。
    施托茨在引用了南共纲领草案中关于世界上存在着对立的两大军事集团的根源的说法以后写道：这真是离奇的说法，根据这种说法，苏联被谴责为和美国一同不顾各国人民的利益奉行把世界划分为势力范围的政策。如果同意这样的“解释”，目前两个阵营就都不是从阶级利益出发的，人们反对的只不过是试图夺取世界霸权的两个帝国主义而已。由此得出的结论是：各国人民应当不信任它们和远离它们。
    施托茨指出，这样，南共纲领草案就在掩盖帝国主义保持冷战的全部责任的同时，恶毒地诽谤了世界上第一个工农国家，丝毫没有考虑它不断奉行的和平政策，破坏了劳动者对这个和平政策的应有的信任并且促使社会主义力量分裂，而社会主义力量的团结和兄弟般的合作是维护和平和保证走向社会主义进步的一个根本因素。
