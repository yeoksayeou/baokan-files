    Definitely Lost
    Dulles delivered a speech to the U.S. Atomic Energy Institute on the evening of the 2nd. In addition to routinely repeating his anti-Soviet, anti-communist, and "deterrent force" nonsense, he also talked a lot about his so-called "American ideals." What exactly are these "American ideals"? Dulles said circuitously: "These ideals are one of the ways we protect and enhance the interests of our country (referring to the United States), which is to strengthen the system of maintaining world order." This is the terminology of war-mongers, not very clear. In plain language, it means that the United States wants to rule and dominate the world.
    Can this "ideal" of the United States be realized? Even Dulles himself is not sure. Therefore, at the end of his speech, he said sadly: "The current stake may be the biggest stake that people have ever placed in peace or war." Today, with the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind and the universal awakening of the people of the world, the "stakes" of Dulles and his ilk are doomed to be lost.

    输定了
    杜勒斯2日晚向美国原子能学院发表了一篇演说，除了照例重复他的反苏反共和“威慑力量”谰调以外，还大谈其什么“美国的理想”。究竟什么是“美国的理想”呢？杜勒斯拐弯抹角地说：“这些理想是我们保护和增进我国（指美国）人民利益的方法之一，就是加强维护世界秩序的体系。”这是战争贩子的术语，不怎么明朗，如果用普通的话来说，就是美国要统治和独霸世界。
    美国的这个“理想”能不能实现呢？连杜勒斯本人也没有把握，因而他在演说的结尾悲哀地说：“目前的赌注也许是人们在和平中或是战争中所曾下过的最大的赌注。”在今天东风压倒西风和世界人民普遍觉醒的情势下，杜勒斯之流的“赌注”是输定了的。
