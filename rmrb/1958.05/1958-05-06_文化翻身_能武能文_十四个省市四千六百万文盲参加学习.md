Xinhua News Agency, May 5th. A vigorous and thriving atmosphere prevails in the work of eliminating illiteracy in rural areas across the country. Leaders are determined, the masses are enthusiastic, the ranks of those participating in the anti-illiteracy work are growing daily, and the number of participants is increasing day by day.

    According to statistics from fourteen provinces and cities, including Beijing, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanxi, Hebei, and Heilongjiang, more than 46 million illiterates have already participated in learning. In many places, almost all young and middle-aged illiterates are enrolled in school. In Jiangsu Province, more than 8,472,000 people have enrolled in seven cities and seven special districts. In Hebei Province, more than 90% of young and middle-aged illiterates in thirty-five counties and cities, including Baoding, Rongcheng, and Dingxian, are participating in learning; in Xushui County, more than 69,000 young and middle-aged illiterates have enrolled, reaching 97% of the total number of existing illiterates.

    To date, Heilongjiang Province and Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. In Henan Province, 54 counties and cities have basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. Xinjiang, Anyi, Linyi, Ruicheng, and Jishan counties in Shanxi Province, Xin County in Shandong Province, and Jin County and Dalian City in Liaoning Province have also basically eliminated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. In addition, Harbin, Qiqihar, Jilin and other cities have basically eliminated illiteracy among workers and staff.

    In the work of eliminating illiteracy throughout the country, many touching scenes of relatives teaching relatives, neighbors teaching neighbors, couples going to school together, and the whole family learning culture have emerged. The masses' enthusiasm for learning is growing, and they propose "Leap forward in spring plowing and literacy," "Fields and construction sites as classrooms, production and learning are both equally important." PingShun County in Shanxi Province organized more than 1,000 construction site study groups, with 21,000 people persisting in learning. Farmers in Longxi County, Fujian Province, brought textbooks and literacy boards to the fields, learning culture while drawing water, and writing words on rocks and trees. The masses, in the context of busy spring plowing and production, combined production with persistent learning, breaking the past convention of "winter school until the New Year, civil schools until plowing." They said:
    "With cultural emancipation, we don't need to ask for help from others for running the cooperative, we have the skills for production, and we are skilled in both civil and military affairs."

    Literate people with culture in various places are widely mobilized and organized, forming a strong army for eliminating illiteracy. The 170,000-person anti-illiteracy team organized by Liaocheng Special District in Shandong Province is responsible for teaching 780,000 illiterates. More than 50,000 cadres sent to lower levels in Jiangxi Province enthusiastically help farmers in mountainous areas learn culture. Farmers in Jinggangshan live scattered, making it inconvenient to concentrate for learning, so the cadres sent to Jinggangshan from the reclamation farm adopted the method of contracting by area, setting up farmers' night schools and reading groups on the spot in farmers' homes and team locations, which were warmly welcomed by farmers in mountainous areas. The common action slogan of the vast number of teachers is: "Follow up the mountain, send down to the fields, move to the river, deliver to the door," wherever illiterates are, teaching follows, with responsibility for teaching and eliminating illiteracy to the end.

    Many provinces, counties, townships, and communes also "learn from the advanced, compare with the advanced, and catch up with the advanced" with on-site visits, on-site debates, and on-site promotion of experience, revising plans, and widely carrying out competition activities. Many local Party committees lead both production and literacy efforts; and adopt a series of measures, combining spring plowing and production, and conducting extensive and in-depth literacy organization and mobilization work through on-site meetings and other forms, with great results. In order to gain experience in carrying out year-round literacy in conjunction with production, many places have also organized forces to engage in "experimental fields," summarizing the systematic experience of literacy work in a timely manner, and introducing and promoting it at any time. Henan, Shanxi, Jiangsu and other provinces promptly organized literacy work inspection teams to conduct in-depth supervision and inspection, discover problems, solve them on the spot, help the backward, drive the general, catch up with the advanced, and require mastering literacy standards, ensuring quality, and emphasizing the implementation of the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical in literacy work.

    In order to further promote the overall great leap forward in the movement to eliminate literacy, the Ministry of Education, the National Association for Eliminating Illiteracy, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the All-China Women's Federation, and the All-China Federation of Handicraft Cooperatives jointly issued a notice deciding to convene the First National Congress of Activists for Eliminating Illiteracy in August this year. Representatives attending the meeting will include representatives of advanced units, outstanding workers, teachers, and students in eliminating illiteracy from workers, handicraftsmen, farmers, and urban residents. Many regions have already convened or are about to convene representative meetings of literacy activists to welcome the convening of this congress.

    文化翻身  能武能文
    十四个省市四千六百万文盲参加学习
    新华社5日讯　各地农村扫除文盲工作呈现出一片蓬勃的兴旺气象。领导决心大，群众热情高，参加扫盲工作的队伍日益壮大，参加学习的人数与日俱增。
    根据北京、江苏、安徽、山西、河北、黑龙江等十四个省、市的统计，已有四千六百多万文盲参加学习。不少地方现有青壮年文盲几乎全部入学。江苏省七个市和七个专区已有八百四十七万二千多人入学。河北省保定、容城、定县等三十五个县、市都有90％以上的青壮年文盲参加学习；徐水县已有六万九千多名青壮年文盲入学，达现有文盲总数的97％。
    到目前为止，黑龙江省和吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州已经基本上扫除了青壮年文盲。河南省已有五十四个县市基本扫除了青壮年文盲。山西省新绛、安邑、临猗、芮城、稷山，山东省莘县，辽宁省金县和旅大市等县市也基本上扫除了青壮年文盲。此外，哈尔滨、齐齐哈尔、吉林等市已经基本上扫除了职工中的文盲。
    各地在扫盲工作中，出现了许多亲教亲、邻教邻、夫妻同上学、全家学文化的动人景象。群众的学习劲头越来越大，他们提出“春耕、扫盲齐跃进”，“田间、工地当课堂，生产、学习两相当”。山西省平顺县组织了一千多个工地学习组，有两万一千人坚持学习。福建省龙溪县农民把课本和识字牌带到田间，边车水、边学习文化，岩石上、树木上都写满了字。群众在春耕生产繁忙的情况下，结合生产坚持学习，打破了过去“冬学到过年，民校到耕田”的常规。他们说：
  “文化翻了身，办社不求人，生产有本领，能武又能文”。
    各地识字的有文化的人广泛地动员组织起来，形成了一支强大的扫盲大军。山东省聊城专区组织的十七万人扫盲队伍，包教了七十八万文盲。江西省五万多名下放干部热情地帮助山区农民学文化。井岗山农民居住分散，不便集中学习，垦殖场下放到井岗山的干部便采取分片包干的办法，就地在农民家里和小队所在地办起农民夜校和读报组，受到山区农民热烈欢迎。广大教师的共同行动口号是：“跟上山、送下地、搬上河、送上门”，文盲在哪里，教学就跟到哪里，包教包扫，负责到底。
    许多省、县、乡、社还相互“学先进、比先进、赶先进”，就地参观，就地辩论，就地推广经验，修订规划，广泛地开展竞赛活动。许多地方党委都是领导生产同时也领导扫盲；并且采取了一系列的措施，结合春耕生产，通过现场会议等形式，进行广泛深入的扫盲组织发动工作，收效很大。为了取得结合生产开展常年扫盲的经验，许多地方还组织力量搞了“试验田”，及时总结扫盲工作的系统经验，随时介绍推广。河南、山西、江苏等省及时组织了扫盲工作检查组，进行深入督促检查，发现问题，就地解决，帮助落后，带动一般，赶上先进，并要求掌握扫盲标准，保证质量，强调在扫盲工作中贯彻多快好省的方针。
    为了进一步促进扫除文盲运动全面大跃进，教育部、全国扫除文盲协会、全国总工会、共青团中央、全国妇女联合会、全国手工业合作总社联合发出通知，决定在今年8月间召开第一次全国扫除文盲积极分子代表大会。出席会议的代表将包括职工、手工业者、农民和城市居民等方面的扫除文盲先进单位、优秀工作者、教师、学员的代表。许多地区已经召开或即将召开扫盲积极分子代表会议，迎接这次代表大会的召开。
