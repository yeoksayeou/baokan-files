    Indeed a Common Practice
    According to the Associated Press, Nixon, in order to adopt a "more friendly" attitude towards Latin American countries that have recently shaken off dictatorial rule, "may investigate accusations that some U.S. officials have openly violated the norm by praising dictators." In fact, openly praising and even supporting reactionary dictators is precisely the norm for U.S. officials, not a "violation of the norm." For example, Eisenhower once praised Jiménez, the dictatorial tyrant deeply hated by the Venezuelan people, and even awarded him the "Medal of Merit" to commend his "fair economic policies" that served American monopoly capital.
    If Nixon wants to "investigate," he should start with his superior, Eisenhower.

    确是常例
    据合众社报道，尼克松为了对最近摆脱独裁统治的拉丁美洲国家采取“更加友好”的态度，“可能调查关于某些美国官员公然违反常例颂扬独裁者的指责”。实际上，公然颂扬甚至扶植反动独裁者恰恰正是美国官员的常例，并不是什么“违反常例”。例如，艾森豪威尔就曾颂扬过希门尼斯这个被委内瑞拉人民深恶痛绝的独裁暴君，并且还授予他“功劳勋章”，嘉奖他为美国垄断资本效劳的“公正的经济政策”。
    尼克松要是想“调查”的话，倒是应该先从他的上司艾森豪威尔作起。
