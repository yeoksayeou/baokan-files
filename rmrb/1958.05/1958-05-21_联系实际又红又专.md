Combining with the masses and practice is the necessary path to becoming thoroughly red and deeply expert. The improvement in both ideology and professional skills of the medical workers of Peking Union Medical College Hospital after going to the countryside is a powerful demonstration of this.

The medical workers of Peking Union Medical College Hospital, by working in the countryside, abandoned the past ideas rooted in bourgeois personal fame and gain, such as only liking to see patients with "research value." They demonstrated a revolutionary humanitarian spirit in their work and were praised by the working people. This is a significant change for the medical workers, and a new phenomenon in the socialist leap forward.

The broad masses of peasants are very eager for the arrival of medical workers. It is meeting this need for urban medical workers to go down to the countryside to work.

Because the medical workers who have gone to the countryside to work have come into contact with the working people and witnessed their revolutionary enthusiasm, and because they have been educated by the working people, their ideological feelings have changed. Therefore, they have developed feelings for the working people and can now feel their pain as their own. In order to relieve the pain of the peasants, they disregard their own hard work, which is a manifestation of the spirit of collectivism. They have already taken a step towards the goal of being red, and as long as they continue to work in this direction, they can achieve even greater gains: becoming even redder, redder to the core.

Going deep among the masses and deep into practice is also very helpful to their "expertise." By treating the broad masses of peasants, their expertise in medical skills has been brought into play. Because the masses demand more from them, they feel that their knowledge is insufficient and their expertise is not deep enough. This prompts them to continue learning and improving. Not only that, reality also shows that going deep among the masses and deep into practice is also more conducive to engaging in research and producing things with "research value." In the past, roundworms entering the bile duct could be surgically removed, but now, in the relatively difficult conditions of the countryside, they have found another way to remove roundworms. It is very meaningful to obtain such results through practice. This is just one example. Countless subjects with "research value" are waiting for medical workers to explore and conduct scientific research.

To the medical workers sent to the countryside, we wish you to become both red and expert, even redder and even more expert, through tempering in practice.

    联系实际又红又专
    金文
    联系群众联系实际，是红透专深必经之路。协和医院的医务工作者下乡后在思想上和业务上都得到了提高，就是一个有力的证明。
    协和医院的医务工作者下乡工作，抛开了过去从资产阶级个人名利出发的只喜欢看有“研究价值”的病人等思想，在工作中表现了革命的人道主义精神，受到了劳动人民的赞扬。这是医务工作者们一个重大变化，这是社会主义跃进中的新气象。
    广大农民十分渴望医务工作者的到来。城市的医务工作者们下放到农村去工作，正适应了这样的需要。
    医务工作者下放到农村去工作，由于接触了劳动人民，看到劳动人民的革命干劲，从劳动人民那里受到了教育，思想感情起了变化，因此，他们对劳动人民产生了感情，已经能够以劳动人民的痛苦为痛苦。为了解除农民的病痛，他们不顾自己辛劳，这就是集体主义精神的表现。他们已经向红的目标前进了一步，只要他们继续朝这个方向努力，就可以取得更大的收获：更红，红得更透。
    深入群众，深入实际，对他们的“专”也很有帮助。为广大农民看病，他们在医务上的一些专长得到了发挥。由于群众对他们要求得更多，他们就感到自己的知识不够，专得不够。这就促使他们继续学习，并得到了提高。不只是这样，现实还说明，深入群众深入实际，也更有利于从事研究，搞出一些有“研究价值”的东西来。回虫钻入人的胆管，可以施行手术除去回虫，如今他们在农村的比较困难的条件下，找到了另外的除去回虫的办法。通过实践得到这样的成果，就很有意义。这仅是一个例子。现实有无数有“研究价值”的课题，正等待着医务工作者们去发掘，去进行科学研究。
    下放农村的医务工作者们，祝你们在实际中锻练得又红又专，更红更专。
