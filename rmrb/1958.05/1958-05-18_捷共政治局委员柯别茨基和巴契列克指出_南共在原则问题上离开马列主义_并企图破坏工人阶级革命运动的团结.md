Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 17th: Czech Communist Party Central Political Bureau member Kobitzky spoke today on behalf of the Czech Communist Party Central Committee at the Slovak Party Congress. He said that to successfully build socialism, and to further strengthen the world socialist system and the international communist movement, thereby contributing to the struggle for peace, is Czechoslovakia's international obligation.

When discussing the danger of revisionism to the further development of the international revolutionary movement, Kobitzky emphasized that the Czech Communist Party will always wage a sharp struggle against any revisionist tendencies. Because, apart from serving the interests of the imperialists, revisionism is of no benefit to anyone or anything. The draft program of the Yugoslav Communists, which is permeated with revisionist viewpoints, is also of no benefit to anyone or anything. He said that the Yugoslav leaders must not expect us to retreat even one step from the teachings of Marxism-Leninism. Although they put forward revisionist viewpoints in order to undermine the unity of the working class revolutionary movement, this unity is becoming increasingly solid. The fact that the Communist Parties of various countries have taken a unified stance in refuting the revisionist viewpoints of the Yugoslav leadership group once again reflects this unity. Kobitzky said that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist Parties of other countries had tried everything possible to make the Yugoslav comrades abandon revisionist viewpoints and find the correct path. Now they have to decide for themselves.

In the second part of his speech, Kobitzky discussed some issues concerning the further strengthening of relations and fraternal unity between the Czech and Slovak nations, and the struggle against nationalism. He reviewed the historical events that were of great significance to the development of the Slovak nation.

He also talked about the resolute struggle waged by the Czechoslovak Communist Party during the bourgeois republic period against the rule of the Czech bourgeoisie in Slovakia, and against the nationalism and separatism of the Slovak reactionary bourgeoisie.

When discussing the tasks in ideological work, Kobitzky pointed out that it is necessary to unswervingly carry out the struggle against religious influence through the propaganda of a scientific world outlook. He reiterated the Party's position that it is not permissible to abuse "freedom of artistic creation" to spread views that contradict the ideological foundations of communism, disseminate pessimism and slander socialist life. He refuted the absurd ideas still held by some Slovak writers, who consider themselves to be judges of the Party, the working class, and the working people, and consider themselves to be the "conscience of the nation."

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 16th: Czech Communist Party Central Political Bureau member and First Secretary of the Slovak Communist Party Central Committee, Bachilek, pointed out at the Slovak Communist Party Congress, which opened in Bratislava on the 16th, that Communists - Leninists are doing their utmost to oppose the attempts of modern revisionists to weaken the leading role of the Soviet Union, and to create divisions between the Soviet Union and other countries in the socialist camp. He emphasized that the Czechoslovak Communist Party has declared that it will wage an irreconcilable struggle against revisionism.

Bachilek delivered a work report on behalf of the Slovak Communist Party Central Committee at the congress. When talking about the Czech Communist Party's views on the results of the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, he emphasized that our Party, like other Communist Parties, has every right and obligation to point out that the Yugoslav Communists have deviated from Marxist-Leninist doctrine on matters of principle, as a result of which they have excluded themselves from the international communist movement, and have taken a completely non-communist stance in their relations with other fraternal parties.

Bachilek said that the aim of modern Yugoslav revisionism is to split the international communist movement and undermine the solidarity of the socialist camp countries. The fact proves that the Yugoslav leaders who hold revisionist views can only see that no Communist Party or socialist country supports Yugoslav revisionism.

Bachilek continued by saying that the main representatives of the Yugoslav Communists treat our criticism with resentment. Although they posture as standing outside of any criticism, they not only infringe on the right to criticize, but also directly slander the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other Communist Parties, and spread revisionist viewpoints under the guise of so-called "new trends" in the workers' movement.

The Czech Communist Party is advancing firmly and unitedly along the road outlined in the Moscow Declaration of the Communist and Workers' Parties, in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism, and in the spirit of proletarian internationalism.

　　捷共政治局委员柯别茨基和巴契列克指出
　　南共在原则问题上离开马列主义
　　并企图破坏工人阶级革命运动的团结
    新华社布拉格17日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员柯别茨基今天代表捷共中央在斯洛伐克党代表大会上讲了话。他说，顺利地建设社会主义，并且进一步加强世界社会主义体系和国际共产主义运动从而对争取和平的斗争作出贡献，这就是捷克斯洛伐克的国际义务。
    柯别茨基在谈到修正主义对国际革命运动进一步发展的危险时强调指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党将永远对任何修正主义倾向进行尖锐的斗争。因为，修正主义除了符合帝国主义者的利益以外，对于任何人和任何事情都没有什么好处。贯穿着修正主义观点的南共纲领草案也是对于其他任何人和任何事情都没有好处的。他说，南斯拉夫领导者们绝不能期望我们从马克思列宁主义的教导中甚至后退一步。虽然，他们提出修正主义观点是为了破坏工人阶级革命运动的团结。但是，这种团结正在日益牢固。各国共产党采取了一致驳斥南共领导集团的修正主义观点的立场这件事，再一次体现了这种团结。柯别茨基说，苏联共产党和其他国家的共产党曾经想尽了一切办法想要使南斯拉夫的同志放弃修正主义观点而找到正确的道路。现在只好由他们自己决定。
    柯别茨基在他讲话的第二部分谈到进一步加强捷克和斯洛伐克两个民族间的关系和兄弟团结以及反对民族主义的斗争的一些问题。他回顾了对斯洛伐克民族的发展具有重要意义的历史事件。
    他还谈到捷克斯洛伐克共产党人在资产阶级共和国时期为反对捷克资产阶级在斯洛伐克的统治，以及为反对斯洛伐克反动资产阶级的民族主义和分离主义所进行的坚决斗争。
    柯别茨基在谈到思想工作方面的任务时指出，要通过宣传科学的世界观始终不渝地进行反对宗教影响的斗争。他重申党的立场是不允许滥用“艺术创造自由”来传播同共产主义意识形态基础相矛盾的见解，散布悲观情绪和毁谤社会主义生活。他驳斥了某些斯洛伐克作家仍然保持着的荒唐的想法，他们认为自己是判断党、判断工人阶级和劳动人民的法官、认为自己是“民族的良心”。
    据新华社布拉格16日电　捷克斯洛伐克共产党中央政治局委员、斯洛伐克共产党中央第一书记巴契列克，在16日在布拉迪斯拉发开幕的斯洛伐克共产党代表大会上指出，共产党人——列宁主义者尽他们最大的力量反对现代修正主义者削弱苏联领导作用的企图，反对在苏联和社会主义阵营其他国家之间制造分裂的企图。他着重指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党已经宣称要对修正主义进行不调和的斗争。
    巴契列克代表斯洛伐克共产党中央委员会在代表大会上作了工作报告。他在谈到捷共对南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会的结果的看法时强调说，我们党同其他共产党一样，完全有权利和义务指出，南共在原则问题上是离开了马克思列宁主义学说的，结果它就把自己排除在国际共产主义运动以外，并且在对其他兄弟党的关系上就站在完全非共产主义的立场上。
    巴契列克说，南斯拉夫现代修正主义的目的是要分裂国际共产主义运动和破坏社会主义阵营国家的团结一致。事实证明，持有修正主义观点的南共领导人却只能看到，没有任何一个共产党或社会主义国家支持南斯拉夫的修正主义。
    巴契列克接着说，南共的主要代表人物以怨恨的态度对待我们的批评。虽然他们摆出站在任何批评以外的姿态，可是他们不仅侵犯了批评的权利，还直接对苏联共产党和其他共产党进行诬蔑，并且在所谓工人阶级运动的“新趋向”的掩盖下传播修正主义观点。
    捷共正在本着马克思列宁主义的精神，本着无产阶级国际主义的精神，沿着共产党和工人党莫斯科宣言所概述的道路坚定地和团结一致地向前迈进。
