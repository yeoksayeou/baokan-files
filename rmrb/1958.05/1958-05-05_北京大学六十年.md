Peking University at Sixty
By Our Correspondent

    The predecessor of Peking University was the Imperial University of Peking, founded in December 1898. After the Xinhai Revolution, it was renamed Peking University. In 1953, during the nationwide adjustment of higher education institutions, the engineering, agricultural and other departments of Peking University were separated and merged with the liberal arts and sciences departments of Yenching University to become a new type of comprehensive university, with May 4th designated as the anniversary.

    Peking University cultivates talent in the fields of natural sciences and humanities for the country. The university now has fourteen departments with thirty-seven specializations, with more than seven thousand eight hundred students, as well as two hundred and fifty-seven foreign students from twenty-one countries, and one thousand two hundred teachers, including twenty-four foreign teachers hired from fraternal countries and capitalist countries. During the First Five-Year Plan for socialist construction in our country, it has trained more than four thousand graduates and two hundred and twenty-five graduate students. These young intellectuals are contributing their strength to the socialist construction of the motherland all over the country.

    Peking University was born and grew up in struggle. Its predecessor, the Imperial University of Peking, was a product of the Reform Movement of 1898. From the very beginning, this school unfolded a struggle between reform and conservatism under the guiding principle of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning for application." Before the May Fourth Movement, under the leadership of bourgeois democratic intellectuals, the school implemented certain reform measures, hired some progressive teachers, established a scholarly research atmosphere, and became the cradle of the May Fourth New Culture Movement.

    At that time, Li Dazhao was a professor at Peking University. He and some progressive teachers put forward the revolutionary slogans of "Down with the old ethics" and "Down with the Confucian shop," attacking feudal culture. During the May Fourth anti-imperialist patriotic movement, the vast number of teachers and students stood at the forefront of the struggle and carried out a sharp struggle against the feudal warlords. After the October Socialist Revolution brought its sound to our country, Li Dazhao and others quickly accepted communist ideas and spread Marxism in our country. Our people's great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, came to Peking University twice in 1918 and 1919 to study Marxism and carry out propaganda activities.

    After the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, progressive teachers and students of Peking University, under the secret leadership of the Party, consciously and in an organized manner carried out anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggles. Deng Zhongxia, an outstanding revolutionary activist in our country, was a student in the Chinese Department of Peking University at that time. He created a model of the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants here. During the period of 1921-1926, the progressive teachers and students of Peking University, under the leadership of the Party, carried out a series of anti-warlord struggles. In 1926, the warlord rule cruelly persecuted the progressive forces of Peking University, and Li Dazhao, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, was persecuted, but the revolutionary forces did not disappear because of this, but were tempered and became stronger.

    After the failure of the Great Revolution in 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled China, and the persecution of progressive forces intensified. The progressive teachers and students of Peking University, under the leadership of the Party's underground organization, never stopped fighting against the dark forces. In the great "December 9th" patriotic anti-Japanese movement of 1935, the progressive teachers and students of Peking University also played a vanguard role. In the "December 1st" anti-civil war and pro-democracy student movement of 1945, and in the movement against the atrocities of the US military in 1946, the progressive teachers and students of Peking University, with a spirit of fearless sacrifice, advanced wave upon wave, writing a glorious page in the cause of the liberation of the motherland.

    After liberation, Peking University became the property of the people. It gained new life and entered a period of unprecedented development. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, it carried out a series of reforms, especially in 1952, when teachers initially carried out self-ideological remolding, adjusted departments and specialties, and reformed the teaching system, teaching content, teaching methods, and teaching organization, fundamentally changing the nature of Peking University, which has become a socialist university. Its scale has also expanded greatly compared with that before liberation. The number of graduates trained in the past nine years is equal to the total number of the fifty years before liberation. The state's expenditure on this school in 1957 was one hundred and ninety times that of 1947 before liberation. The number of laboratories has increased from twenty at the time of liberation to one hundred and twenty-seven, and the library collection has also increased from one million two hundred thousand volumes to one million nine hundred thousand volumes.

    Now, Peking University is using the critical and revolutionary spirit of Marxism-Leninism to resolutely and thoroughly eliminate bourgeois ideology, to build a new communist university, and to strive to catch up with the world's most advanced scientific levels.

    北京大学六十年
    本报记者
    北京大学的前身是京师大学堂，创办于1898年12月，辛亥革命后改名为北京大学。1953年全国各高等院校调整时，北大的工、农等院系分出去而和燕京大学文理等科合并成为一个新型的综合性大学，定5月4日为校庆日。
    北京大学为国家培养自然科学和人文科学方面的人才。现在全校设有十四个系三十七个专业，有学生七千八百多人，还有来自二十一个国家的外国留学生二百五十七人，教师一千二百人，从兄弟国家和资本主义国家聘来的外国籍教师二十四人。在我国社会主义建设第一个五年计划中，已经培养了四千多名毕业生和二百二十五个研究生，这些青年知识分子正在全国各地为祖国社会主义建设贡献着自己的力量。
    北京大学是在斗争中诞生，斗争中成长的。它的前身京师大学堂，就是戊戍维新改良运动的产物。这个学校一成立就在“中学为体西学为用”这个教学方针下，展开了维新和守旧的斗争。到“五四”前，这个学校在资产阶级民主主义的知识分子主持下，推行了某些改革的措施，聘请了一些进步的教师，树立了学术研究的风气，成为“五四”新文化运动的策源地。
    那时，李大钊是北京大学的教授，他和一些进步教师在这里提出了“打倒旧礼教”“打倒孔家店”的革新口号，向封建主义文化进行了攻击。“五四”反帝爱国运动期间，广大师生站在斗争的最前面，和封建军阀进行了尖锐的斗争。十月社会主义革命胜利的炮声传来我国后，李大钊等人迅速地接受了共产主义的思想，在我国传播了马克思主义。我国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席在1918年、1919年间曾两次来到北京大学，钻研马克思主义，并进行了宣传活动。
    1921年中国共产党成立后，北京大学进步师生就在党的秘密领导下自觉地有组织地进行了反帝反封建的斗争。我国杰出的革命活动家邓中夏，当时是北京大学中文系的学生，他在这里创造了知识分子与工农相结合的典型。1921—1926年这个期间北京大学的进步师生在党的领导下进行了一系列的反军阀的斗争。1926年军阀统治对北大的进步势力加以摧残迫害，中国共产党的创始人之一李大钊被迫害，但革命的势力并没有因此消失，而锻炼得更坚强了。
    1927年大革命失败后，国民党反动派统治了中国，对进步势力的摧残迫害日甚一日，北京大学的进步师生在党的地下组织领导下，对黑暗势力始终没有停止过斗争。在1935年伟大的“一二·九”爱国抗日运动中，北京大学的进步师生也起了先锋的作用。在1945年的“一二·一”反内战、争民主的学生运动中，在1946年反对美军暴行的运动中，北京大学进步师生都以大无畏的精神，前仆后继，在祖国的解放事业上写下光辉的一页。
    解放后，北京大学为人民所有，它得到了新的生命，进入了空前大发展的时期，在党和政府的领导下进行了一系列的改革，特别是在1952年，教师们初步地进行了自我思想改造，调整了院系、改革教学制度、教学内容、教学方法和教学组织，使北京大学性质起了根本变化，已成为一个社会主义性质的大学。它的规模也比解放前扩大了很多，近九年培养毕业的人数等于解放前五十年的总和。国家在1957年用于这个学校的经费，就等于解放前1947年的一百九十倍。实验室由解放时的二十个增加到一百二十七个，图书馆藏书也由一百二十万册增加到一百九十万册。
    现在北京大学正在用马克思列宁主义的批判的革命的精神，坚决彻底地破除资产阶级思想，为建设一个共产主义的新大学，为赶上世界最先进的科学水平而斗争着。
