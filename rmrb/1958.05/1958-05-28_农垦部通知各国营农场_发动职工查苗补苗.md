Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation Notifies All State-Owned Farms
    Mobilize Workers to Inspect and Replenish Seedlings

    (Our dispatch) The Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation recently issued a notice to state-owned farms, requiring them to mobilize workers to carry out seedling inspection and replenishment work. The notice stated: During this year's spring sowing period, spring droughts occurred in North and Northwest China, while the Mishan area of Heilongjiang experienced rain, snow, and muddy conditions, creating certain difficulties for this year's spring sowing work. However, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in production, the broad masses of workers have mustered their energy and overcome various difficulties. Currently, some spring-sown crops have already emerged, and are generally growing well, but the phenomenon of missing seedlings and broken ridges still exists. In particular, pests and diseases have appeared early, in large numbers, and with great momentum this year. If measures are not taken promptly, it will cause great harm. To this end, all farms are required to quickly organize forces to do a good job in seedling inspection, replenishment, and protection, ensuring that missing seedlings are replenished, pests and diseases are eliminated, and weak seedlings are strengthened (mainly by adopting measures such as topdressing fertilizer, irrigation, and hoeing and weeding). In short, we must ensure that the seedlings are strong and healthy, densely planted with all seedlings present, to lay the foundation for a bumper harvest this year.
    The notice introduced the experience of the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry in organizing mass inspection and appraisal movements in suburban farms, hoping that farms in various regions will learn from this experience, and include the current seedling inspection, replenishment, and protection work as one of the important contents of inspection and appraisal, in order to push production to a new high tide and lay a material foundation for the realization of this year's leap forward production plan.

    农垦部通知各国营农场
    发动职工查苗补苗
    本报讯　农垦部最近通知国营农场，要求发动职工开展查苗补苗工作。通知说：今年春播期间，华北、西北都发生春旱，而黑龙江密山地区又因雨雪泥泞，给今年春播工作带来一定困难。但是在生产大跃进的新形势面前，广大职工鼓起干劲，战胜了各种困难。目前春播作物，部分已经出苗，一般生长尚好，但缺苗断垅现象仍然存在，特别是今年各地病虫害发生早，数量大，来势猛，如不及时采取措施，势将造成大害。为此要求各场迅速组织力量，作好查苗、补苗、保苗工作，作到缺苗必补、病虫必除、弱苗转壮（主要是采取追肥灌溉、中耕除草等措施）。总之必须保证幼苗健壮，密植全苗，为今年丰收打下基础。
    通知介绍了北京市农林局组织郊区各场开展群众性检查评比运动的经验，希望各地农场学习这一经验，并把目前的查苗、补苗、保苗工作，列为检查评比重要内容之一，以便把生产推向新的高潮，为实现今年跃进的生产计划奠定物质基础。
