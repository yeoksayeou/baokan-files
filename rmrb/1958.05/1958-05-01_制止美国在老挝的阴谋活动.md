Stop the United States' Conspiracy in Laos
Commentator of this newspaper

Since the establishment of the Lao coalition government in November 1957, the United States has continuously intimidated and sabotaged Laos, attempting to reignite the civil war in Laos and turn Laos into a military base for aggression against China, Vietnam, and other Southeast Asian countries. Now, the United States is actively plotting to undermine the supplementary elections in Laos, attempting to overthrow the coalition government.

As early as the beginning of the establishment of the Lao coalition government, the United States announced its "serious unease" about the situation in Laos. Then it threatened to stop "aid" and shamelessly interfered in Laos' internal affairs, demanding that Laos guarantee to it that "Laos will not become communist." This is already the most blatant and naked act of interference. But things did not stop there. The United States further attempted to force Laos to devalue its currency from the original 35 kip per dollar to 100 kip per dollar. This would obviously put Laos' finances and economy in an extremely difficult situation, while the United States could more brutally carry out economic plunder of Laos. It can be seen that the so-called "opposition to communism" is just a guise, and its purpose is to enslave the Lao people and turn Laos into an American colony.

According to Lao newspapers, in order to further undermine the Geneva Accords and the coalition government, the United States has instigated some Lao reactionaries to persecute personnel of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and members of the Lao Patriotic Front, taking advantage of the upcoming supplementary elections in Laos on May 4, in an attempt to incite opposition among the various parties, so as to undermine the atmosphere of domestic unity, thereby allowing the United States and conspirators to profit from it. It is worth noting that South Vietnamese newspapers, which have always reflected American intentions, have already impatiently been spreading propaganda that military conflicts in Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces have reignited, attempting to create an excuse for American intervention.

This series of conspiracies by the United States cannot but arouse the serious attention of all those who care about maintaining peace in Southeast Asia and the Geneva Accords. According to Agence France-Presse, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front, has written to the International Commission for Laos, the President of the National Assembly, and Prime Minister Phouma, urging them to pay attention to these acts of persecution.

These crude actions by the United States have raised a serious question to patriotic people of all strata in Laos. The United States firmly opposed the restoration of peace in Indochina at the 1954 Geneva Conference, but the Lao people made the right choice. The United States firmly opposed the realization of Lao's peaceful reunification and the establishment of a coalition government, but the Lao people made another wise choice. Now the United States is about to resort to vicious means to undermine the supplementary elections in Laos in order to ultimately achieve the goal of undermining the peaceful reunification of Laos. We have reason to expect the Lao people to once again repel American interference.

The Chinese people were pleased to see the establishment of the Lao coalition government and to see the implementation of the various agreements between the Royal Government and the Pathet Lao Fighting Units. This is in line with the spirit of the Geneva Accords and also in line with the peaceful interests of the Lao people and the region. Therefore, the Chinese people hope and believe that the Lao Royal Government and patriotic people of all strata will strengthen unity, oppose American interference, and enable the supplementary elections to be held smoothly and fairly, creating more favorable conditions for the peaceful reunification of Laos.

    制止美国在老挝的阴谋活动
    本报评论员
    自从1957年11月老挝成立联合政府以来，美国曾不断对老挝进行恫吓和破坏，企图重新挑起老挝内战，变老挝为侵略中、越两国和东南亚其他国家的军事基地。现在，美国又积极策划破坏老挝的补充选举，企图推翻联合政府。
    还在老挝联合政府成立之初，美国就宣布它对老挝局势的“严重不安”。接着它就威胁要停止“援助”，还无耻地干涉老挝的内政，要老挝向它保证“老挝不会共产主义化”。这已经是最粗暴、最露骨的干涉行为了。但是事情并不止于此。美国进一步企图强迫老挝将老挝的货币由原来的三十五基普比一美元贬为一百基普比一美元。这显然将使老挝的财政经济处于极端困难的境地，而美国则可以更加凶残地对老挝进行经济掠夺。由此可见，所谓“反对共产主义化”原来只不过是一个幌子，它的目的在于奴役老挝人民和把老挝变为美国殖民地。
    据老挝报纸报道，为了进一步破坏日内瓦协议和联合政府，美国已经策动一些老挝反动分子，乘5月4日老挝即将举行补充选举的机会，对前寮国战斗部队人员和老挝爱国战线成员施加迫害，企图煽动各党派之间的对立情绪，以破坏国内团结的气氛，从而使美国和阴谋分子从中获得渔翁之利。值得注意的是，一向反映美国意图的南越报纸已经迫不及待地在宣传说，丰沙里和桑怒两省的军事冲突已经重新爆发，企图为美国干涉制造借口。
    美国这一系列的阴谋活动不能不引起一切关心维护东南亚和平和日内瓦协议的人们的严重注意。据法新社报道，老挝爱国战线主席苏发努冯亲王已经写信给老挝国际委员会、国会主席和富马首相，吁请他们注意这些迫害事件。
    美国的这种粗暴行为向老挝各阶层的爱国人士提出了一个严肃的问题。美国在1954年日内瓦会议时曾经坚决反对恢复印度支那的和平，但是老挝人民做了正确的选择。美国曾经坚决反对实现老挝的和平统一和成立联合政府，但是老挝人民又作了明智的选择。现在美国又要施展恶毒的手法来破坏老挝的补充选举以便最后达到破坏老挝和平统一的目的。我们有理由期待老挝人民再一次击退美国的干涉。
    中国人民曾经高兴地看到老挝联合政府的成立，看到王国政府和寮国战斗部队之间的各项协议正在实施。这是符合日内瓦协议的精神，也是符合老挝人民和这个地区的和平利益的。因此，中国人民希望并且相信，老挝王国政府和各阶层爱国人士将加强团结，反对美国的干涉行为，使补充选举能在公平合理的情况下顺利地举行，为老挝的和平统一创造更有利的条件。
