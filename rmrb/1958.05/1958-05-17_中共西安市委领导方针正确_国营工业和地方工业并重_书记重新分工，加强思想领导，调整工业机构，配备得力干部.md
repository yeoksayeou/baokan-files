This newspaper's Xi'an dispatch on the 16th: Reporter Yi Xiao reports: The Xi'an Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party is actively implementing the central government's policy of simultaneously promoting both industrial and local industries; while vigorously developing local industries, it continues to strengthen leadership over large-scale state-owned industries.

　　In order to simultaneously strengthen leadership over state-owned and local industries, the Municipal Committee has reassigned responsibilities. Previously, only one secretary was in charge of industry; now, in addition to the First Secretary focusing primarily on industry, another secretary is assigned to be responsible for local industry, and another secretary is responsible for state-owned industry. The Municipal Committee's industrial department is divided into two industrial departments, the first and the second, allocating stronger cadres to assist the Municipal Committee in leading local and state-owned industries, respectively. Capital construction is handled separately by the Capital Construction Department. The Municipal Committee's First Secretary, secretaries, standing committee members, and department heads each concurrently serve as the Party Secretary of a factory (most of which are large state-owned factories) or are responsible for liaising with a factory. Recently, they have inspected the work of various state-owned factories on several occasions, resolving many major issues in production. At the same time, the Organization Department, the Propaganda Department, and the United Front Work Department, among others, have recently strengthened their leadership and research on organizational, propaganda, ideological education, and united front work in factories and mines.

　　The Xi'an Municipal Committee has conducted unified planning for local and state-owned industries, enabling them to divide labor and cooperate with each other, and promote each other. Given that Xi'an's emerging state-owned industries are mainly mechanical industries, and that raw materials rely on external sources, the focus of this year's construction of local industries is on establishing raw material and fuel industries, in order to solve part of the demand in state-owned industries and the development of local industries. At the same time, the Municipal Committee considered that state-owned cotton spinning, oil extraction, and power industries have a large capacity, and decided that local areas will no longer build such factories in a short period of time, in order to avoid duplication and ensure that state-owned factories have sufficient raw material supply.

　　The vast majority of Xi'an's large-scale state-owned factories have only recently been built, and production order has not yet been established; there are many transferred cadres with unfamiliar businesses; and more than 80% of the workers are new workers. In response to this situation, the Municipal Committee has carried out a series of tasks. At the end of February, the Municipal Committee held a three-level cadre meeting on industry, focusing on studying state-owned industrial work, overcoming conservative ideas among cadres, and tapping potential. During the meeting, various factories and construction units formulated leap forward plans, and then formulated organizational measures and implemented technological innovation. At the end of March and the beginning of April, they organized an inspection of this work, and found that the measures formulated by individual workers and groups were relatively concrete, while those above the workshop level were more general, which was related to the fact that the rules and regulations in production management lagged behind the leap forward situation. To this end, in April, the masses were mobilized to conduct great contending and great blooming in combination with improving the work of office departments, breaking down old and unreasonable rules and regulations. This work is currently deepening step by step, forming a widespread mass movement to reform enterprise management. The Municipal Committee recently also held industrial lectures, organizing the main cadres of these factories to study the management experience of old factories in Northeast China and other places.

　　The Xi'an Municipal Committee has also organized state-owned factories and local factories to cooperate, contract to build local factories, undertake the production of local factory equipment, produce products needed locally, and accept processing orders from other provinces, as well as trial-produce several tractors, undertake the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, small power machinery and other tasks, to help the current newly built large-scale factories overcome the difficulties of insufficient tasks during the leap forward.

　　中共西安市委领导方针正确
　　国营工业和地方工业并重
　　书记重新分工，加强思想领导，调整工业机构，配备得力干部
    本报西安16日电　记者伊晓报道：中共西安市委积极贯彻中央工业与地方工业同时并举的方针；在大力发展地方工业的同时，继续加强对国营大型工业的领导。
    为要同时加强对国营工业和地方工业的领导，市委重新进行了分工。原来只有一个书记负责工业，现在除第一书记以主要力量抓工业外，还抽出一个书记分工负责地方工业，另一个书记负责国营工业。市委工业部分为第一、第二两个工业部，调配较强的干部，分别辅助市委领导地方工业和国营工业。基本建设另由基本建设部负责。市委第一书记、书记、常委和部长们都各自兼职一个工厂（其中大多是国营大工厂）的党委书记或负责联系一个工厂。最近，他们都次数不等地检查了各国营厂工作，解决了生产中的许多重大问题。同时，组织部、宣传部和统战部等，最近也分别加强了对厂矿中的组织、宣传、思想教育和统一战线等项工作的领导和研究。
    西安市委对地方工业和国营工业进行了统一规划，使两者相互分工协作，互相促进。针对西安市新兴国营工业主要是机械工业，原材料依靠外来这一情况，把今年兴建地方工业的重点，放在举办原材料和燃料工业方面，以解决国营工业和发展地方工业中的一部分需求。同时，市委考虑到国营棉纺、榨油和电力等工业，能力很大，决定地方上在较短时间内不再建设这类工厂，以避免重复，保证国营工厂有充分的原料供应。
    西安市的绝大多数国营大型工厂，都是最近才建成的，生产秩序尚未建立；转业干部多，业务生疏；80％以上的工人都是新工人。针对这一情况，市委进行了一系列工作。市委在2月底举行了工业三级干部会议，着重研究国营工业工作，克服干部中的保守思想，发掘潜力。在会议进行中，各厂各建筑单位制定了跃进规划，并随即拟订组织措施和贯彻技术革新。3月底、4月初，又组织了对这一工作的检查，发现工人个人和小组的措施订的比较确实，车间以上则比较笼统，而这又和生产管理方面的规章制度落后于跃进形势相联系着。为此，4月份发动群众大鸣大放结合改进科室工作，破除旧的不合理的规章制度。目前这一工作正在步步深入，形成一个改革企业管理广泛群众性运动。市委最近还举办了工业讲座，组织这些厂的主要干部到东北等地学习老厂管理经验。
    中共西安市委还组织国营工厂和地方工厂协作、包建地方工厂，承制地方工厂设备，生产地方所需产品和接受外省加工订货等项措施，试制几种拖拉机，承担生产排灌机械、小型动力机械等任务，来帮助当前新建大型工厂克服跃进中任务不足的困难。
