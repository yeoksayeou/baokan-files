Xinhua News Agency, May 5th dispatch from Tehran: Ignoring protests from people at home and abroad and condemnation from international public opinion, the Iranian authorities plan to execute Khosrow Rouzbeh between May 5th and 10th.

Khosrow Rouzbeh is a famous Iranian patriot. He was arrested by the Iranian authorities on July 6, 1957. On February 25th of this year, the Iranian military court sentenced Rouzbeh to death. The Iranian authorities' decision to execute Rouzbeh once again demonstrates that the Iranian authorities are unwilling to abandon their inhuman acts of destroying democracy and suppressing progressives.

Xinhua News Agency, May 5th dispatch: According to a TASS report on the 4th, people's organizations, prominent figures, and public opinion in Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria strongly condemned the Iranian authorities' barbaric act of preparing to execute Rouzbeh, a famous Iranian patriot.

Academician Mirku of Romania wrote in the "Bucharest News" that I, along with our compatriots and prominent figures from all sectors of culture and society nationwide, demand the cancellation of the death sentence against this Iranian patriot. "Scinteia" wrote that progressive humanity demands the saving of the life of this Iranian patriot. The Hungarian "Népszabadság" published an editorial entitled "Rouzbeh Must Live!" The Bulgarian "Rabotnichesko Delo" pointed out that the Iranian authorities' preparation to carry out the death sentence against Rouzbeh is a crime against democracy and progress. It wrote that the working people of Bulgaria resolutely demand the cancellation of the death sentence against Rouzbeh.

    伊朗当局不顾世界人民抗议
    竟图杀害爱国者鲁兹贝赫
    罗保匈公众愤怒谴责这种野蛮行为
    据新华社5日讯　德黑兰消息：伊朗当局不顾国内外人民的抗议和各国舆论的谴责，计划在本月5日至10日间将霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫处死。
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫是伊朗著名的爱国者。1957年7月6日，他被伊朗当局逮捕。今年2月25日，伊朗军事法庭判处鲁兹贝赫死刑。现在伊朗当局决定把鲁兹贝赫处死，再一次表明伊朗当局不肯放弃其摧残民主和镇压进步人士的非人道的行为。
    据新华社5日讯　据塔斯社4日报道，罗马尼亚、匈牙利和保加利亚的人民团体、知名人士和舆论强烈谴责伊朗当局准备处死伊朗著名爱国人士鲁兹贝赫的野蛮行为。
    罗马尼亚米尔库院士在“布加勒斯特消息报”上写道，我同我们的同胞和全国文化、社会各界著名人士一起要求取消对这个伊朗爱国者判决的死刑。“火花报”写道，进步人类要求拯救这个伊朗爱国者的生命。匈牙利“人民自由报”发表题为“鲁兹贝赫应当活下去！”的社论。保加利亚“工人事业报”指出，伊朗当局准备执行对鲁兹贝赫判决的死刑是对民主和进步的犯罪。它写道，保加利亚劳动人民极其坚决地要求取消对鲁兹贝赫判决的死刑。
