Tai Chi Activities in the Mountain City

One of the characteristics of the mountain city of Chongqing is the large number of people practicing Tai Chi every morning. From 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM, whether at the Datianwan Stadium, People's Park, or the Cultural Palace, you can see dozens of people practicing Tai Chi together. This is not a mere coincidence, but something that can be seen every day.

Take the stadium as an example. It is a good place with flowers, green trees, and a smooth surface. Every day, just as dawn breaks, Tai Chi enthusiasts come here one after another. At a little after six o'clock, the first group of seventy or eighty people lines up and begins to practice. The instructor leads them through the thirteen postures of Tai Chi. Everyone practices diligently, doing one round and then another. Does the team stay at this size? No, it doesn't. Elementary school students wearing red scarves pass by on their way to school and join in for a few postures. Cadres and workers walk by, watch for a while, and naturally enter the ranks. The number of people increases constantly. After the first group finishes, at seven o'clock, the second group of seventy or eighty people arrives. After the second group finishes, the third group arrives. Thus, every morning, three groups totaling two to three hundred people practice here.

Besides this place, in front of the gymnasium, in the Cultural Palace, and in the People's Park, many Tai Chi enthusiasts can be seen practicing every morning, move by move.

Tai Chi has truly become a mass sports activity in Chongqing. From the leading comrades of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee to ordinary workers, students, and citizens, all participate in this activity. Li Tangbin and Xin Yizhi, secretaries of the Municipal Party Committee, and Deputy Mayor Deng Ken, among others, participate in the exercises almost every day. Now, throughout the mountain city, there are two to three thousand people who regularly practice Tai Chi, a grand scene that cannot be seen elsewhere.

Tai Chi has not only blossomed in the mountain city but has also borne fruit. Take Deputy Mayor Deng Ken as an example. He used to suffer from severe stomach ulcers, and despite regular medication, the condition would come and go. He started practicing Tai Chi last October, and by January of this year, he had stopped taking medication, and the stomach ulcers had stopped recurring. Now, Comrade Deng Ken often shares his personal experience to encourage other comrades to join in the practice. Ji Hezeng, a cadre in the Telecommunications Bureau, who is over sixty years old and has suffered from insomnia for more than twenty years, sought medical treatment everywhere in the past but never found a cure. Later, someone told him that practicing Tai Chi could cure insomnia, so he insisted on practicing every day. After only eight or nine months, he was completely cured.

### 山城里的太极拳活动

    山城里的太极拳活动
    山城重庆的特点之一，就是每天清晨打太极拳的人非常多。早六点到八点之间，无论在大田塆体育场、人民公园或在文化宫等地，你都能看到几十个人在一起练太极拳。这并不是偶然的现象，而是每天都可以看到的。
    就拿体育场一处来说吧。这里花草遍地，绿树成荫，场地平整，确实是个好去处。每天天刚亮，太极拳爱好者们就都陆续来到这里。六点多钟，第一批七、八十个人就排好队开始练了。辅导员领着做太极拳十三势。每个人都认真地练，做完一遍，再来一遍。队伍是不是就这样的规模了，不是的。带红领巾的小学生上学路过这里正赶上，他们就参加练几个势子。机关干部和工人们走来，看着看着，就很自然地进入了行列。人不时地在增加。第一批练完了，七点钟，第二批七、八十人又来了。第二批练完第三批又来了。就这样，每天清早都有三批共二、三百人在这里练拳。
    除了这个地方，在体育馆前，文化宫里，人民公园中，每天清晨也都有不少太极拳爱好者在一招一势的练。
    太极拳在重庆真正地成了群众性运动项目了。从市委和市人民委员会的领导同志到一般工人、学生、市民，都参加了这项活动。市委书记李唐彬、辛易之和副市长邓垦等差不多天天都参加锻炼。现在整个山城经常练太极拳的人已经有两三千人，这种盛况在别处那是看不到的。
    太极拳在山城不只是开了花，确实也结了果。就拿邓垦副市长来说，他原来患严重的胃?疡，经常吃药还是时好时犯。去年10月他开始练太极拳，到今年1月已经不吃药了，胃?疡也不犯了。现在邓垦同志经常现身说法，劝别的同志参加练拳。年纪已六十多岁、患有二十多年失眠症的电信局干部纪贺曾，过去四处求医，总治不好。后来人家告诉他练太极拳能治好失眠症，他就每天坚持练，练了不过八、九个月，就全好了。
