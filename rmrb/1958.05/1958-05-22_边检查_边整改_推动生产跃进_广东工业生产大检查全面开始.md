　　Checking and Rectifying Simultaneously to Promote Production Leap Forward
　　Guangdong's Comprehensive Industrial Production Inspection Begins

　　(Our newspaper dispatch) According to the Nanfang Daily: After the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee issued instructions on organizing a major inspection of industrial production in May, the six inspection teams organized by the province set off one after another. Party committees in various regions also quickly drew cadres to organize inspection teams. By around May 10th, most prefectures, cities, and counties had already taken action, with secretaries, commissioners, county and city leaders, and leading cadres from the industrial and transportation fronts taking the lead. According to preliminary statistics from eight special zones and seventy-two cities and counties, a total of 2,971 cadres were drawn. Among them, Guangzhou, Shantou, Shaoguan, Zhanjiang, and Foshan, five cities directly under the province, accounted for 1,487 people, with Guangzhou alone reaching 1,189 people.

　　Regarding the organization of inspection work in various regions, in addition to dividing areas and assigning responsibilities, some regions have also organized capital construction and mining inspection teams, and some have even established special groups for township and commune-run industries to be responsible for studying and promoting township and commune-run industries.

　　Some regions have put forward relatively clear requirements and practices for this major industrial production inspection. For example, the Jiangmen Municipal Party Committee proposed to resolutely rely on grassroots party organizations, boldly mobilize the masses, and achieve "everyone inspects, everyone thinks of solutions, and everyone contributes ideas." Conduct inspections while rectifying, firmly grasp the key issues in production, and quickly launch a technological innovation movement. Through inspection, continue to overcome the right-leaning conservative ideology of leaders and promote a great leap forward in production. The Shantou Special Zone also proposed to combine the major production inspection with preparations for organizing a propaganda campaign to support agricultural mechanization and mobilize the masses to report mineral deposits, contribute technology, and sell equipment and materials.

　　The work of the "Red May" production leap forward inspection in the grassroots units of Guangzhou's industry, handicrafts, transportation, and capital construction systems has generally begun. Ten cadres above the level of committee member and more than fifty bureau and department-level cadres from the Municipal Party Committee are participating in this inspection work. Through this major production inspection, preliminary results have been achieved. For example, many factories and handicraft cooperatives in the southern district originally lacked confidence in completing their second-half-year plans. After the major inspection, the right-leaning conservative ideology was initially criticized, and 85% of the units now have confidence. Based on the problems identified during the inspection, the central, northern, and southern districts also organized district-wide production collaboration meetings, combining inspection, rectification, and the great leap forward. The northern and southern districts also held district-wide collaboration and exchange conferences on the 10th and 13th respectively, using methods such as big-character posters, charts, and physical object exhibitions to present what their units could support and what support they needed, expressing their willingness to support each other.

    边检查  边整改  推动生产跃进
    广东工业生产大检查全面开始
    本报讯　据南方日报消息：中共广东省委自从发出关于在5月份组织对工业生产大检查的指示后，省组织的六个检查团先后出发，各地区党委也迅速抽调干部组织检查队伍，至5月10日前后大多数地、市、县已经行动起来，由书记、专员、县、市长及工业交通战线的领导干部出马挂帅。据八个专区七十二个市、县的初步统计，共抽调干部二千九百七十一人。其中广州、汕头、韶关、湛江、佛山五个省辖市共一千四百八十七人，仅广州即达一千一百八十九人。
    各地区检查工作的组织，除分区分片包干外，部分地区又组织了基建、矿山检查组，个别的还设立乡、社办工业的专门小组，负责研究和推动乡、社办工业。
    对于这次工业生产大检查的要求和做法，有些地区提得比较明确。例如，江门市委就提出要坚决依靠基层党组织，放手发动群众，做到“人人检查，人人想办法，人人献计策”。边检查边整改，紧紧抓住生产中的关键问题，迅速开展技术革新运动。通过检查，继续克服领导的右倾保守思想，促进生产大跃进。汕头专区还提出结合生产大检查准备组织支援农业机械化的宣传运动和发动群众报矿献技术、献卖器材。
    广州市工业、手工业、交通以及基建各系统的基层单位红五月生产跃进大检查的工作已普遍开始。市委有委员以上干部十人，局、处级干部五十多人参加这次检查工作。通过这次生产大检查，已初步取得了效果。如南区的工厂和手工业社原来有很多单位对完成下半年计划信心不足，经过大检查，初步批判了右倾保守思想，已经有85％的单位有了信心。中、北、南区根据检查出来的问题，还组织了全区性的生产协作会议，使检查、整改和大跃进结合起来。北区和南区通过检查还分别在10日、13日召开全区性的协作交流大会，运用大鸣大放的方法，以大字报、图表、实物展览等形式，提出本单位能支援什么和要求支援什么，表示要相互支援。
