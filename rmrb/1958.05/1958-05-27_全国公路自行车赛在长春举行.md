Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, May 25th: The 1958 National Highway Cycling Championships opened today in Changchun. Two hundred and thirty-six male and female athletes from twenty-six cycling teams representing provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and the Chinese People's Liberation Army are participating in this competition. More than 90% of these athletes have participated in provincial, municipal, and national cycling competitions; more than thirty of them have achieved the standard of national-level athletes (track and field). Famous worker-athletes, such as Li Fengqin, a model worker in Dalian City and a sand-molding worker at Dalian Shipyard, and Lin Tianhua, a bicycle worker from Putian County, Fujian Province, have come to participate in this competition.

    After the opening ceremony, the women's 25-kilometer team race began. The competition among the various teams was fierce. The athletes of the People's Liberation Army team were all of similar physical and technical level and had strong endurance. During the race, their organization was very tight. Zhang Xinmei and Zhang Zhengui took turns leading the race, with other team members closely following, protecting each other, and moving forward together in a neat formation. This team won first place with a time of two hours, fifteen minutes, and twenty and eight-tenths seconds. Closely following behind was the Fujian team, which took second place.

    Today, the person in charge of the games told reporters: In recent years, cycling has greatly developed in our country. In 1956, this sport had 600,000 athletes, and now it has increased to nearly one million, gradually forming a mass movement. The athletes' achievements have also rapidly advanced. In the future, this sport will continue to develop in the direction of highways and stadiums. He said: The Party and the state attach great importance to this sport and give it strong support in all aspects. Because we have a broad mass base and good conditions, if we improve our training methods, this sport can completely catch up with international standards in three to five years.

    全国公路自行车赛在长春举行
    据新华社长春25日电　1958年全国公路自行车锦标赛今天在长春市开幕。参加这次比赛的有全国各省、市、自治区和中国人民解放军等二十六个单位自行车代表队的二百三十六名男、女运动员。这些运动员中90％以上都曾经参加过省、市和全国的自行车比赛；其中有三十多人的成绩已达到了国家运动健将级的标准（田径跑道）。著名的工人运动员如旅大市工业劳动模范、大连造船公司翻砂工李凤琴，福建省莆田县自行车工人林天华等都前来参加这次比赛。
    开幕式后，女子二十五公里团体比赛开始。各个代表队争夺十分激烈。解放军队运动员们体力和技术水平个个相差不多，耐久力强。他们在比赛时，组织十分严密，张信梅、张振桂交替领骑，其他队员紧紧跟上，互相掩护，共同前进，阵容整齐。这个队以二小时十五分二十秒八夺得第一名。紧跟在后面的是福建代表队，得第二。
    运动会负责人今天对记者说：这几年来，自行车运动在我国有很大发展。1956年，这项运动已拥有六十万运动员，到现在增加到近百万人，渐渐形成了群众性的运动。运动员们的成绩也迅速跃进。今后这项运动将继续向公路和赛场的方向发展。他说：党和国家对这项运动十分重视，从各方面予以大力支持。由于我们有广大群众基础和良好的条件，如果在训练方法上加以改进，这项运动完全可以在三、五年内赶上国际水平。
