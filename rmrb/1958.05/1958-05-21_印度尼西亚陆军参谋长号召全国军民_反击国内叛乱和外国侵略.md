Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 20th: Indonesian Army Chief of Staff Nasution, in a message to all officers and men of the armed forces today marking the 50th anniversary of Indonesia's National Awakening Day, said that the Indonesian armed forces and people must once again save their country and nation, and resist domestic rebellion and external aggression.

In the message, Nasution exposed the conspiracy of domestic rebel groups colluding with "certain foreign countries" to attack the Republic of Indonesia. He said that those foreign countries were attempting to replace the Indonesian head of state, prime minister, and leaders of the armed forces with people they could exploit. The hands of foreign subversion had reached into Indonesia, and they had airdropped more than 10,000 weapons to the rebels. They also supplied the rebels with ships, bombers, Mustang fighter planes, and pilots from the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to attack the Republic of Indonesia. The message accused this interference of being colonialist aggression.

Nasution pointed out that the rebel group had sought help from the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and further colluded with the "Islamic Army" and the "Republic of South Maluku."

He further pointed out that foreign troops and foreign aircraft had arrived in Sulawesi and Halmahera Island in the Maluku Islands.

Nasution announced that the Indonesian armed forces had launched sea, land, and air offensives against the rebel group and had landed in many places, with the aim of pushing the battle directly into the heart of the rebels and foreign interventionists.

He said that in order to defend Indonesia's independence and sovereignty, it is necessary to continue and resolutely cleanse the armed forces of anti-republic elements, warlords, politicians, and businessmen; it is necessary to strengthen Indonesia's armed forces in terms of personnel and equipment, implement conscription laws, increase national vigilance, strengthen naval and air defenses, and resolutely enhance the unity between the government, the military, and the people.

Nasution once again warned domestic and foreign elements and groups not to exploit the situation in Indonesia for political and strategic gain. He said, we must continue to defend the republic based on the "Pancasila" (Five Principles), which pursues an independent foreign policy and implements the principle of "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" (Unity in Diversity) internally.

Note: "Bhinneka Tunggal Ika" is Indonesia's national motto, written on the Indonesian coat of arms.

    印度尼西亚陆军参谋长号召全国军民
    反击国内叛乱和外国侵略
    新华社雅加达20日电　印度尼西亚陆军参谋长纳苏蒂安今天在纪念印度尼西亚民族觉醒日五十周年时向武装部队全体官兵发表文告说，印度尼西亚武装部队和人民必须再度拯救他们的国家和民族，反击国内叛乱和外部的侵略。
    纳苏蒂安在文告中揭露了国内叛乱集团同“某些外国”勾结来进攻印度尼西亚共和国的阴谋活动。他说，那些外国企图把印度尼西亚的国家元首、总理和武装部队的领导人换成它们能够利用的人。外国颠覆活动的手已经伸入印度尼西亚，他们空投给叛乱分子的武器已经超过了一万件。他们还把船只、轰炸机、野马式战斗机以及美国和蒋介石集团的飞行员供给叛乱分子，用来进攻印度尼西亚共和国。文告指责这种干涉是殖民主义者的侵略。
    纳苏蒂安指出，叛乱集团已经寻求东南亚条约组织的帮助，同时进一步与“伊斯兰教军”和“南马鲁古共和国”勾结。
    他进一步指出，外国军队和外国飞机已经到达苏拉威西和马鲁古群岛的哈马黑拉岛。
    纳苏蒂安宣布，印度尼西亚武装部队已经向叛乱集团发动海、陆、空攻势，并且在许多地方登陆，目的在把战斗直接推向叛乱分子和外国干涉者的心脏地区。
    他说，为了保卫印度尼西亚的独立和主权，必须继续和坚决地把反对共和国分子、军阀、政客和商人从武装部队里清洗出去；必须在兵员和装备方面加强印度尼西亚的武装部队，必须实行兵役法，提高民族警惕，加强海空方面的防御，必须坚决增进政府、军队和人民之间的团结。
    纳苏蒂安再度警告国内外分子和集团不要利用印度尼西亚的局势来谋取政治上和战略上的利益。他说，我们要继续保卫以“建国五基”为基础的共和国，这个共和国对外奉行独立政策，对内执行“殊途同归”的原则。
    按：“殊途同归”是印度尼西亚的建国的箴言，写在印度尼西亚共和国的国徽上。
