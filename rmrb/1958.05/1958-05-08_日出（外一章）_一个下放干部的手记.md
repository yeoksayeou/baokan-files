    Sunrise is a wondrous sight, often inspiring poets and painters to exclaim and cheer. For example, sunrises at sea, sunrises on Mount Tai, are all such instances. I am neither a poet nor a painter, just an ordinary farmer, and I prefer to sing the praises of sunrises over the fields.
    "Work at sunrise, rest at sunset," is the ancient rule. We are "not seeing the sun at either end" – working before sunrise and still not resting after sunset. Therefore, we are fortunate to witness the beautiful and magnificent sight of "The East is Red, the sun rises" every day. We greet the sunrise with labor and leaps forward, and sing its praises. Every day, as soon as it dawns, the bell rings, and we set off, going to the fields. At this time, the sun has not yet appeared, but it has already cast a glow in the east, and then it spits out red flames and shoots out golden light; this fire burns redder and redder, this light shines brighter and brighter, our labor songs become louder and louder, and our leaps forward become faster and faster. But the most moving moment is the very first encounter between the sun and us. It leaps out above the mountains in the east, smiling broadly, wishing us good morning, and then rises higher and higher, like a bright mirror, illuminating our way forward. Then our labor enthusiasm burns even more strongly.
    When the sun is "three poles high," the bell rings again, it is time for breakfast. We walk from the fields to the village. The village, having achieved "four withouts," has taken on a new look, and in the morning sun it feels even more fresh and delightful. This ordinary village is surprisingly clean; the streets, courtyards, kangs, and stoves seem to be spotless; the white walls, black doors, and green windows are harmoniously colored and mutually radiant. We sing songs as we enter. Ah! How lovely are the fields! How lovely is the village! How lovely is the morning!
    Moonlit Night
    In the fields bathed in moonlight, people line up in a row, side by side, tilling the land. What is shining? The bright eyes of the people and the sharp iron hoes in their hands. What is making noise? The rustling sound of the hoes entering the soil, the thudding sound of the hoes turning over the clods of earth. People's energy and attention are focused on intensive cultivation and competition, and they have no intention of speaking, only the captain occasionally issuing warnings: "Pay attention to quality! Dig deep enough!"
    In the village, children are digging pits in front of every house, planting poplar trees. This is the last activity in the drive to green the village. Two trees in front of each house, one on the left and one on the right, how beautiful it will be! The moonlight shines into the village, shines into the streets, gently illuminating the children planting poplar branches in the pits.
    The deeper the night, the brighter the moon. The people in the fields return from their night battle and sleep soundly, while she continues to illuminate the quiet fields and villages, until the East is Red, the sun rises, and she fades away, fades away. At this time, the fields and villages will be boiling again.

    日出（外一章）
    一个下放干部的手记
    冯健男
    日出构成奇景，常引起诗人和画家的惊喜和欢呼。例如海上的日出，泰山的日出，就都是的。我不是诗人，也不是画家，只是一个普通的农民，我宁愿歌颂田野间的日出。
    “日出而作，日入而息”，这是古人的常规。我们是“两头不见太阳”——日未出已先作，日已入仍不息。因此，我们有福每天观赏“东方红，太阳升”的美丽、宏伟的景象。我们是以劳动、以跃进来迎接日出，来歌颂日出的。每天天刚亮，钟声就响了，我们就出动了，下地了。这时，太阳还没有露面，但已在东方放出了曙光，随后，就吐出了红色的火焰，射出了金色的光辉；这把火愈烧愈红，这道光愈射愈烈，我们的劳动歌声也愈来愈嘹亮，我们的跃进步伐也愈来愈急速。但最动人的还是太阳跟我们最初见面的一瞬间。它一跃而露出在东方的山头之上，笑容满面，问我们早安，然后就愈升愈高，有如明镜，照耀着我们前进。于是我们的劳动热情就更加强烈地燃烧起来。
    到了“日高三丈”，钟声又响了，是吃早饭的时候了。我们从田野向村庄走去。村庄由于实现了“四无”而焕然一新，在清晨的阳光里更令人觉得清新可喜。这个普通的村庄整洁得出奇；街道、院落、炕头、锅台，看来都一尘不染；白墙、黑门和绿窗色彩调和，互相辉映。我们唱着歌，走进来了。呵！多么可爱的田野！多么可爱的村庄！多么可爱的早晨！
    月夜
    在洒满了月光的田野里，人们一字儿排开，齐头并进地在翻地。什么在发亮？是人们的明亮的眼睛，和他们手中的锐利的铁铣。什么在发响？是铁铣插入泥土的沙沙声，是铁铣翻倒泥块的卜卜声。人们的精力和注意力都集中在精耕和竞赛上面，都无心说话，只有队长不时发出警告：“注意质量！挖够尺寸！”
    在村庄里，家家门前都有孩子在挖坑坑，栽杨树。这是突击绿化村庄的最后一项活动。每家门前两棵树，左边一棵，右边一棵，该有多美呵！月光射进了村庄，射进了街道，温柔地照着孩子们把杨树枝栽入坑中。
    夜愈深，月愈明。地里的人们夜战归来，酣睡了，她还在照射着静静的田野和村庄，一直到东方红，太阳升，她才淡下去，淡下去。这时，田野和村庄又该沸腾起来了。
