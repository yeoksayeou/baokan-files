Timely Harvest, Grain Returns Home
Hubei Farmers Actively Prepare for Summer Harvest and Fight Against Wind and Rain Disasters

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 14th) With the summer harvest approaching, Hubei Province is actively preparing in all aspects to ensure timely harvesting and threshing, so as to bring every grain home.

At present, command organizations and harvest-rush armies for summer harvesting have been universally established from the province to the communes. In Xinzhou County, the number of people participating in the harvest rush reached 300,000, each preparing three sickles and four pairs of straw sandals. The harvest-rush army organized by Mianyang County has one gasoline lamp per team and one kerosene lamp per group, ready for night battles.

In order to solve the contradiction of labor shortage during the wheat harvest, various localities, through arranging work and making labor plans, are trying their best to do everything that can be done in advance, and postpone what can be postponed, so as to stagger various jobs. Various localities have also brought into play the spirit of socialist collective cooperation. The mountainous areas of Xianning County alone organized more than 10,000 laborers to support the plain areas in rushing to harvest wheat. At the same time, farm season canteens, nurseries, and laundry groups have been universally established in various localities.

However, more attention is being paid to the promotion and creation of new tools suitable for the local area, so as to reduce labor intensity and improve labor efficiency. The famous Henan sickle has been widely promoted here. Xiaogan Prefecture recently created seven new tools related to rushing to harvest wheat, threshing, etc., and Anlu County created a hand-cranked wheat harvester, which is more than ten times more efficient than a sickle.

During this period, handicraft industry, commerce and other departments are also fully supporting the preparations for the summer harvest.

(Our newspaper's Wuhan dispatch on the 14th) Hubei Province's more than 36 million mu of summer harvest crops are about to be harvested, but they have been hit by wind and rain. At present, the vast number of farmers are fighting against the wind and rain with the spirit of "man will conquer nature," striving to ensure that the summer harvest crops about to be obtained are not or minimally damaged.

In recent days, commune members in various localities have been braving strong winds and heavy rains to rescue wheat. Xiangyang County has 100,000 people participating in the late-stage management of wheat fields every day, guarding the wheat fields from morning to night. Due to continuous rainy days in Jingzhou, Huanggang, Xiaogan and other prefectures, many summer harvest crops have experienced waterlogging. In order not to reduce the yield of these wheat crops that are about to mature, commune members are opening ditches, draining water, opening side ditches, and building dikes in the fields day and night. Xiaogan Prefecture alone has 3 million people participating in the above-mentioned activities every day.

Various localities have adopted the method of rushing to harvest barley and rapeseed that have already turned yellow. In order to prevent barley and rapeseed from rotting, many places have been seizing the time to rush to thresh while rushing to harvest.

Hubei Province has been experiencing wind and rain since late April, which has had a great impact on the maturity of summer harvest crops. Therefore, the province's movement to fight disasters and ensure a good harvest is still continuing. (Tian Zhuang)

　　适时收割　颗粒还家
    湖北农民积极准备夏收，并同风雨灾害作斗争
    本报武汉14日电　夏收已近，湖北省正从各方面积极准备，保证及时收割、脱粒，作到颗粒还家。
    目前，从省到社夏收工作的指挥机构和抢收大军，已经普遍建立起来。新洲县参加抢收的人数达三十万，他们每人准备了三把镰刀，四双草鞋。沔阳县组织的抢收大军，每个队一盏汽灯，每个组一盏马灯，准备夜战。
    为了解决麦收中劳力不足这一矛盾，各地通过安排活路，作出劳动规划，凡能提前赶做的活都尽量提前，能缓的就缓，使各种活路错开。各地还发挥了社会主义集体协作的精神。仅咸宁县的高山区就组织了一万多个劳动力，支援平原地区抢收小麦。同时各地还普遍建立了农忙食堂、托儿组和洗衣组。
    但是，各地更大的注意力还是在推广和创造适合本地区的新工具方面，以便减轻劳动强度，提高劳动效率。河南省有名的删镰，已在这里普遍推广。孝感专区最近创造了有关抢收小麦、脱粒等新工具达七种之多，安陆县创造了一种手摇割麦机，工效比镰刀提高十倍以上。
    在这期间，手工业、商业等部门也都全力支援夏收准备工作。
    本报武汉14日电　湖北省三千六百多万亩夏收作物，眼看就要开镰收割，这时却遭到了风雨袭击。目前，广大农民正以“人定胜天”的干劲，与风雨作斗争，力争即将到手的夏收作物不受或少受损失。
    连日来，各地农业社社员正在冒着狂风骤雨抢救小麦。襄阳县每天有十万人参加麦田后期管理工作，他们从早到晚在麦田里防守着。荆州、黄冈、孝感等专区由于连日阴雨的结果，许多夏收作物已经发生了渍灾现象。为了不使这些就要成熟的小麦减产，社员们正不分日夜地在田间开沟、排水、开剅、筑壋。仅孝感专区每天就有三百万人，参加上述各种活动。
    各地对已经黄熟了的大麦、油菜采取了抢割。为了防止大麦、油菜霉烂，许多地方在抢收的同时，都及时抓紧抢打。
    湖北省从4月下旬起就风风雨雨，这对夏收作物的成熟有很大影响。因此，全省抗灾保丰收的运动仍正继续开展着。　（田庄）
