　　Establish Advanced Banners, Summarize Advanced Experiences
　　Anhui Conducts Thorough Pest Elimination Inspection
    Inspecting and Solving Problems Simultaneously to Promote the Backward to Catch Up with the Advanced
    (Our Correspondent Li Xiangren) Anhui Province recently conducted its first province-wide inspection and preliminary evaluation of the pest elimination and hygiene campaign. Through inspection and evaluation, advanced banners were established throughout the province, a large number of advanced experiences created by the masses were summarized, and various problems were promptly resolved, which greatly promoted the further development of the pest elimination and hygiene campaign in the province.
    This time, Anhui Province's inspection and evaluation of the province's pest elimination and hygiene campaign was very large-scale, with a total of more than 100 participants, including Gui Linqi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, and Lu Xuebin, Vice Governor of Anhui Province. The scope of the inspection was very broad and relatively in-depth. From April 7 to 22, seven inspection teams inspected five special districts, eight cities, twenty-eight counties, twenty-six townships, forty towns, forty-six agricultural cooperatives, seventy-two neighborhood committees, one hundred and forty-six institutions, fifty-two schools, forty-four factories, forty-six health and medical institutions, twenty-seven hostels, and seventy-six other grassroots units. During the inspection and evaluation process, reports from various special districts and cities were heard, on-site inspections were conducted, and advanced units were evaluated, and experiences were summarized and exchanged through group discussions and plenary reports. According to the "1958 Anhui Province Pest Elimination and Hygiene Evaluation Conditions and Reward Trial Measures," the advanced areas identified in this inspection included Fuyang Special District, Bengbu Special District, Bengbu City, Ma'anshan City, and thirteen counties and cities including Jieshou, Xiao County, Shucheng, He County, Tunxi, and Tongling. For example, in the Fuyang Special District, which was rated as an advanced area, the secretaries of the Party committees at all levels in the special district personally took charge and mobilized the masses vigorously. After two months of hard work, they eliminated more than 69 million rats and sparrows, averaging more than nine rats and sparrows per person in the special district. More than 180,000 public toilets were newly built in the special district, averaging one public toilet for every 38 people. Sanitary avenues in a fish-backbone style were built from towns to villages, trees were planted, walls were whitewashed in every household, and furniture was moved and washed thoroughly. Farmers began to develop hygienic habits such as frequent bathing, washing clothes, and brushing their teeth, showing a new atmosphere of cleanliness everywhere indoors and outdoors. The Bengbu United Meat Processing Plant, which was rated as an advanced unit, achieved fly- and maggot-free status and maintained cleanliness thanks to the efforts of all employees. Yangxiaozhai Village in Jieshou County has been eliminating pests and promoting hygiene for six years as if it were only yesterday, and has now become a banner for pest elimination and hygiene.
    This inspection and evaluation, due to the adoption of the method of inspecting and solving problems simultaneously, played a role in promoting some backward areas and units, and timely solved the specific difficulties raised by various places. For example, Anqing City was later than the other cities in mobilizing the masses to vigorously carry out pest elimination and hygiene work. During the inspection, some backward units and blind spots were found. The inspection team promptly put forward opinions to the leading organs of Anqing City. The leaders of the city immediately decided to carry out a pest elimination and hygiene assault week throughout the city and take various measures to eliminate backward units and blind spots. The inspection team found that feather processing industry, waste bone purchasing stations, tanneries, and other places prone to breeding mosquitoes and flies had not completely solved the problem of preventing the breeding of mosquitoes and flies due to the failure of technical guidance. After discovering this problem, the inspection team immediately asked the local health department to study and solve this problem.
    During this major inspection, a large number of advanced experiences created by the masses were carefully summarized and promoted. For example, the experience of Liu'an and Wuhu Special Districts in exterminating all rats, large and small, in the wall holes by demolishing old walls and replacing them with new walls; the experience of Shou County in exterminating field mice by using lights; the experience of Shucheng and other places in exterminating maggots with poisonous wild plants such as *naoyanghua*, *zeqi*, *maliao*, *chouchangpu*, *gouqi* fruit, *boluohui*, *zuiyucao*, *mazuimu*, *lilou*, and *mulilou*; the experience of Huadameng Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoxian County in raising fish in paddy fields to eliminate mosquito larvae; and the experience of Hefei, Wuhu and other cities in catching mosquitoes and insects with nets; the experience of Fugang No. 1 Cooperative in Fuyang County in using earth tap water to flush feces in public toilets, etc. These experiences mostly have the characteristics of adapting to local conditions, using local materials, massively eliminating "four pests," closely integrating with production, and achieving multiple benefits with one stroke. For example, the experience of Suji District of Fuyang County in encircling and annihilating sparrows was introduced by Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, at the Bengbu Conference and the Huainan County Party Committee Meeting. By the beginning of April, five cities and forty counties in the province had used this tactic. At the beginning, it was one district, one county, or one city, and later it developed to several counties and cities, and even joint operations of the entire special district. Due to the widespread promotion of this experience, by April 20, a total of more than 122.27 million sparrows had been eliminated in the province. In terms of eliminating rats, due to the promotion of various advanced experiences and the use of various tools, a total of more than 196.26 million rats had been eliminated in the province by April 20. In Hefei and other cities, catching mosquitoes and insects with nets, one person can catch more than 3,000 flying mosquitoes and insects in one evening. The Huadameng Agricultural Cooperative in Chaoxian County raises fish in paddy fields to eliminate mosquito larvae, and each *mu* of paddy field can produce 160 *jin* to 480 *jin* of fish, and the income is equivalent to 400 *jin* to 1,200 *jin* of rice. The fish eat weeds in the fields, reducing fertilizer losses, and the fish manure is also very fertile. The fish eat mosquito larvae and rice stem borers in the fields, which is not only beneficial to pest elimination but also reduces rice diseases.
    Based on the situation of this inspection and the characteristics of the progress of the campaign, the Pest Elimination Headquarters of Anhui Province has made further arrangements for the current work of pest elimination and hygiene.

　　树立先进旗帜　总结先进经验
　　安徽进行除四害大检查
    边检查、边解决问题，推动落后赶先进
    本报讯　记者李祥仁报道：安徽省最近对除四害讲卫生运动进行第一次全省性的大检查和初步评比。通过检查评比，在全省范围内树立了先进旗帜，总结了群众创造的大量先进经验，及时解决了各种问题，对全省进一步开展除四害讲卫生运动起了很大的促进作用。
    安徽省这次对全省除四害讲卫生运动检查评比工作的规模很大，参加检查评比的有中共安徽省委书记处书记桂林栖、安徽省副省长陆学斌等共一百多人。检查的范围很广泛，也比较深入。七个检查组从4月7日到22日，共检查五个专区、八个市、二十八个县、二十六个乡、四十个镇、四十六个农业社、七十二个居民委员会、一百四十六个机关、五十二个学校、四十四个工厂、四十六个卫生医疗机构、二十七个旅社和七十六个其他基层单位。在检查评比过程中，听取了各专区、市的汇报，进行了实地考察，通过小组酝酿、大组汇报，评比了先进单位，总结和交流了经验。根据1958年安徽省除四害讲卫生评比条件和奖励试行办法，这次检查评出的先进地区有阜阳专区、蚌埠专区、蚌埠市、马鞍山市，界首、萧县、舒城、和县、屯溪、铜陵等十三个县市。如被评为先进地区的阜阳专区，全专区各级党委书记亲自挂帅出马，大力发动了群众，经过两个月的苦战，仅消灭鼠雀就达六千九百多万只，按全专区人口平均每人捕鼠雀九只多。全专区新建了公共厕所十八万多个，平均每三十八人就有一个公共厕所。从城镇到农村都修建了鱼脊式的卫生大道，栽上了树木，家家户户都粉刷了墙壁，家具都经过了大搬家，大洗刷，农民都开始养成了常洗澡、常洗衣服和刷牙等卫生习惯，出现了室内室外到处干干净净的新气象。被评为先进单位的蚌埠联合肉类加工厂，由于全厂职工的努力，做到了无蝇无蛆，并经常保持了清洁。界首县杨小寨村，除四害讲卫生六年如一日，现在已成为除四害讲卫生的旗帜。
    这次检查评比，由于采用了边检查、边解决问题的办法，对一些落后地区和单位起了推动作用，对各地提出的具体困难及时给予解决。如安庆市在发动群众大干除四害讲卫生工作比其余几个市做的较迟，在检查中发现了一些落后单位和死角，检查组及时向安庆市领导机关提出了意见，这个市的领导上立即决定在全市范围内开展除四害讲卫生突击周，并采取各种措施消灭落后单位和死角。检查组发现羽毛加工业、杂骨收购站、皮革厂等容易孳生蚊蝇的场所，由于技术指导跟不上，没有彻底解决防止蚊蝇的孳生问题，检查组发现这个问题后，立即请当地卫生部门进行研究解决这个问题。
    这次大检查中认真总结推广了群众创造的大量的先进经验。如六安、芜湖专区通过拆陈墙换新墙，一次灭绝墙洞里大小老鼠的经验；寿县用灯光灭鼠法消灭田鼠的经验；舒城等地用闹羊花、泽漆、马蓼草、臭菖蒲、枸?果、博落回、醉鱼草、马醉木、藜芦、木藜芦等有毒性的野生植物灭蛆的经验；巢县花大门农业社在稻田里养鱼消灭孑孓的经验；合肥、芜湖市等地用网兜捕蚊虫的经验；阜阳县阜光一社公共厕所用土自来水冲刷粪便的经验等。这些经验大都具有因地制宜、就地取材、大量歼灭“四害”，密切结合生产而又一举几得的特点。如阜阳县苏集区对麻雀大围歼的经验，经省委第一书记曾希圣同志在蚌埠会议和淮南县委书记会议上介绍，到4月初，全省已有五个市和四十个县运用了这一战术。开始是一个区、一个县或一个市，后来发展到几个县市，以至全专区联合作战。由于普遍推广了这一经验，至4月20日，全省已共消灭麻雀一亿二千二百二十七万多只。在消灭老鼠方面，由于推广了各种先进经验和使用了各种工具，全省到4月20日，已消灭一亿九千六百二十六万多只老鼠。合肥等市用网兜捕蚊虫，一个人一个傍晚能捕捉飞蚊虫三千多只。巢县花大门农业社在稻田养鱼消灭孑孓，每亩稻田可产鱼一百六十斤到四百八十斤，收益相当于四百斤到一千二百斤稻谷，鱼在田中吃掉杂草，减少了肥料的损耗，同时鱼粪也很肥，鱼在田里吃孑孓和二化螟等害虫，不但对除四害有利，而且也减少了水稻病害。
    安徽省除四害总指挥部根据这次检查的情况和运动进展特点，对当前除四害讲卫生的工作作了进一步的部署。
