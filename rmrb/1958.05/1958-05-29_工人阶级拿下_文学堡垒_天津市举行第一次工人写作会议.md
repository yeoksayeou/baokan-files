Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 28th: The first "Workers' Writing Conference" held in Tianjin on the 25th put forward a new task: to liberate thinking, exert full effort, and rapidly establish a powerful literary and artistic force of the working class itself.

At the conference, worker-amateur writers expressed their confidence: the working class should not only be masters in the fields of social production, politics, and economics, but also be masters in the fields of culture and art. The working class knows itself best, and therefore has the most right to write about itself.

The conference pointed out that in the past few years, a number of worker-amateur writers have emerged in Tianjin. Since the Great Leap Forward, amateur creative activities of staff and workers have seen an unprecedentedly prosperous situation. At present, more than a thousand workers in the city are engaged in writing. Judging only from the statistics of worker creations published in Tianjin Daily and other five newspapers and periodicals from March to early May, more than 140 worker authors have published a total of 228 novels, poems, essays, etc. Many workers have the heroic spirit to take down the "literary fortress." Many old workers who used to dislike reading literary books and dared not write articles have now broken the mysterious view of literature and often write articles and read novels.

How to establish a workers' literary and artistic team in a faster, better, and more economical way? The conference believes that, first of all, politics must be in command, and literature and art must serve politics and production. Everyone reviewed that in the past nine years since liberation, the literary and art circles in Tianjin have resolutely defended the Party's policy of establishing a workers' literary and artistic team in the process of fighting against the Hu Feng counter-revolutionary group and various bourgeois literary and artistic thoughts. Great achievements have been made in cultivating worker authors. However, the shortcoming lies in the past incomplete understanding of building a worker-author team, paying too much attention to the writing talent of worker authors, while the ideological and political education of the authors was not grasped tightly. The conference pointed out that these lessons must be learned in the future, and ideological and political work must be raised to the proper height.

Secondly, it is necessary to correctly solve the issues of popularization and improvement, "professional" and "amateur." The conference believes that the first is popularization, and it is necessary to extensively mobilize the masses and, under the leadership of the Party, form a mass literary creation activity in which "everyone writes and everyone can write." At the same time, improvement should be made on the basis of popularization. As for the issue of "professional" and "amateur," the conference believes that first, one must be a good worker, and secondly, one must also be a good worker-author, so as to achieve a double leap forward in production and writing.

What should be written about? The conference also discussed this. Everyone believes that we should focus on praising the heroic spirit of the working class, describing the new people and new things that have emerged from workers in production labor, and writing "factory history." More than one hundred Tianjin worker-amateur writers attended the meeting.

    工人阶级拿下“文学堡垒”
    天津市举行第一次工人写作会议
    据新华社天津28日电　25日在天津举行的第一次“工人写作会议”上，提出了一项新的任务：解放思想，鼓足干劲，迅速建立一支工人阶级自己的文艺大军。
    在会议上，工人业余作者们充满信心地表示：工人阶级不仅要在社会生产、政治经济的领域里做主人，而也要在文化艺术的领域里做主人。工人阶级自己最熟悉自己，因而也就最有权利自己写自己。
    会议指出：在过去几年，天津市已出现了一批工人业余作者。大跃进以来，职工业余创作活动更出现了空前未有的繁荣局面。目前，全市已有一千以上工人从事写作。仅从天津日报等五个报刊3月至5月上旬发表工人创作的统计，就有一百四十多名工人作者发表了小说、诗、散文等共二百二十八篇。许多工人都有拿下“文学堡垒”的英雄气概。许多老工人过去不爱看文学书，不敢写文章，现在打破了文学的神秘观点，经常写文章看小说了。
    如何多快好省地建立起工人的文艺队伍？会议认为：首先要政治挂帅，文艺一定要为政治、为生产服务。大家回顾了解放九年来，天津市文艺界在和胡风反革命集团以及各种资产阶级文艺思想进行斗争的过程中曾经坚决捍卫了党的建立工人文艺队伍的方针。在培养工人作者方面取得了很大成绩。但是缺点是在于过去对建立工人作者队伍的认识不全面，过多地注意了工人作者的写作才能，而对作者的政治思想教育工作则抓的不紧。会议指出，今后必须吸取这些教训，把政治思想工作提到应有的高度。
    其次，是要正确解决普及与提高、“业”和“余”的问题。会议认为：首先是普及，必须广泛发动群众，在党的领导下，形成一个“人人都来写，人人都能写”的群众性的文学创作活动。同时在普及的基础上提高。至于“业”和“余”的问题，会议认为，首先要做一个好的工人，其次也要做一个好的工人作者，要作到生产、写作双跃进。
    关于写什么？会议也进行了讨论。大家认为应该着重表扬工人阶级的英雄气概，描写工人在生产劳动中涌现出来的新人新事，写“工厂史”。出席会议的有天津工人业余作者一百多人。
