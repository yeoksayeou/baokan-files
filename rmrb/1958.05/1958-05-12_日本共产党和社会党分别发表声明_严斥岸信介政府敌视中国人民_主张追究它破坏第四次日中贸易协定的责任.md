Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - The Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party issued a statement today, strongly condemning the Kishi Nobusuke government for adopting a policy of antagonizing China, which has led to an extremely bad state of relations between Japan and China.

The statement pointed out that although Japanese imperialism had launched a brutal war of aggression against China in the past, the Chinese government has consistently adopted a friendly policy towards the Japanese people, which is well known. The statement accused Nobusuke Kishi, who had committed war crimes against the Chinese people as the Minister of Commerce and Industry of the Tojo government, of not only not repenting for the crimes he committed, but now brazenly adopting a policy of antagonizing the Chinese people. The statement pointed out that under the current circumstances, the complete cessation of Sino-Japanese trade negotiations will have a serious impact on the Japanese industry, which is suffering from increasingly severe economic recession. The Kishi Nobusuke government should bear all responsibility for this. The statement said that now the Japanese trade, fisheries and other industries and people from all walks of life have come out to hold the Kishi Nobusuke government accountable and demand that the Japanese government change its policy towards China, which is only natural.

The statement pointed out that the Japanese people are eager to restore diplomatic relations between Japan and China. Therefore, in this general election, a clear and firm verdict should be passed on the Kishi Nobusuke government, which ignores the interests of the Japanese people and obstructs the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China in various ways.

The statement also strongly condemned some Japanese bourgeois newspapers for completely failing to hold the Kishi Nobusuke government accountable for following the United States in adopting a policy of antagonizing China in their comments and reports on the current Sino-Japanese relations. Instead, they sided with the Kishi Nobusuke government, attacked the Chinese government, and attempted to create anti-China public opinion in Japan.

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 11th - The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 11th, accusing the Kishi Nobusuke government of undermining Sino-Japanese relations and stating that it would thoroughly investigate the responsibility of the Kishi Nobusuke government.

The Socialist Party's statement was issued after an emergency meeting of leading cadres held on the morning of the 11th.

The statement said that Sino-Japanese relations have now reached a very worrying situation. The responsibility of the Japanese government is very great. The statement condemned the Japanese government for ignoring its own responsibilities and saying that China is "interfering in Japan's internal affairs" and that China is supporting the Japanese Socialist Party, etc. The Japanese government also put forward arguments such as "politics and trade are two different things." The statement pointed out, "This is nothing more than trying to cover up the essence of the problem."

The statement said that the Kishi Nobusuke government has not only not changed its policy of following the United States, but has recently deepened its degree of following. Especially towards China, it is not only very negative about various exchanges between Japan and China, but even antagonizes China with words and deeds similar to supporting Taiwan's Chiang Kai-shek group in "counterattacking the mainland." This policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which runs counter to the general trend and public opinion, has thus undermined Sino-Japanese relations.

The statement went on to say that due to this erroneous policy of the Kishi Nobusuke government, Sino-Japanese trade has been virtually cut off, and those involved in Sino-Japanese trade have been greatly affected, which is very regrettable.

The statement said that the situation does not allow for a moment's hesitation. The Socialist Party believes that the way to deal with the current problem is to: cancel Kishi Nobusuke's anti-China words and deeds; cancel Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi's remarks that destroyed the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and promptly provide guarantees for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. In order to find a way to resolve the current situation, the Socialist Party demanded that formal talks be held immediately between the Socialist Party and the Liberal Democratic Party to reach a conclusion and let the government implement it, and to send a delegation of the Diet to China.

The Socialist Party pointed out, "The fundamental solution to the problem is for the Liberal Democratic Party to change its diplomacy of following the United States and formulate a diplomatic policy that strives for Japan's true independence."

The statement also said that the basic policy of the Japanese Socialist Party towards China is to: abandon the diplomacy of following the United States, establish an independent and autonomous diplomatic policy, and establish friendly relations with the people of all countries; conduct comprehensive political, economic, cultural and other exchanges with the People's Republic of China to enhance the friendly relations between the two countries and find ways to formally restore diplomatic relations; support the representation of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations. The statement said that in order to achieve the above basic policy, the Socialist Party has consistently made efforts and has gained the support of public opinion.

    日本共产党和社会党分别发表声明
　　严斥岸信介政府敌视中国人民
    主张追究它破坏第四次日中贸易协定的责任
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央常任干部会今天发表声明，强烈指责岸信介政府采取敌视中国的政策，以致使日中两国关系陷入极其恶劣的状态。
    声明指出，虽然过去日本帝国主义对中国发动了残暴的侵略战争，但是中国政府对日本人民一贯采取了友好政策，这是众人皆知的事情。声明指责，过去身为东条政府商工相而对中国人民犯过战争罪恶的岸信介，不但对自己犯过的罪恶不悔悟，现在还厚颜无耻地采取敌视中国人民的政策。声明指出，在目前情况下，日中贸易商谈之陷入全面停止状态，对经济不景气愈加深刻化的日本产业，将带来严重打击。这个责任应当由岸信介政府全部承担。声明说，现在日本贸易、渔业等产业界和各阶层人民已经出来追究岸信介政府的责任，要求日本政府改变对中国的政策，这是理所当然的。
    声明指出，日本人民是迫切要求恢复日中两国邦交的，因此，在这次大选中，应当对忽视日本人民的利益、多方阻挠恢复日中两国邦交的岸信介政府以鲜明的态度下坚决的判决。
    声明还强烈指责日本一些资产阶级报纸，在它们的对当前日中两国关系的评论和报道中，完全不追究岸信介政府随从美国采取敌视中国的政策，反而偏袒岸信介政府的立场，攻击中国政府，企图在日本制造反对中国的舆论。
    新华社11日讯　东京消息：日本社会党11日发表声明，指责岸信介政府破坏中日关系，并且表示要彻底追究岸信介政府的责任。
    社会党的这个声明是它在11日上午举行了领导干部紧急会议之后发表的。
    声明说，日中两国关系现在已经发生了非常值得忧虑的情况。日本政府的责任是非常重大的。声明谴责说，日本政府把自己的责任丢在脑后，而说中国“干涉日本内政”，又说中国是声援日本社会党等等。日本政府还提出“政治和贸易是两回事”等主张。声明指出，“这不外是想掩盖问题的本质”。
    声明说，岸信介政府不仅没有改变追随美国的外交，最近反而加深了追随的程度，特别是对于中国，不仅对日本同中国的各种交流非常消极，甚至以类似要支持台湾蒋介石集团“反攻大陆”的言行敌视中国。同大势和舆论背道而驰的岸信介政府的这种政策，就这样破坏了日中关系。
    声明接着说，由于岸信介政府的这种错误的方针，日中贸易形同断绝，同日中贸易有关的人士受到了巨大的影响，这是非常令人遗憾的。
    声明说，情况不允许有片刻的犹豫。社会党认为，处理当前问题的办法是：取消岸信介敌视中国的言行；取消内阁官房长官爱知揆一的破坏第四次日中贸易协定的谈话，迅速对实施第四次日中贸易协定提出保证。为了设法解决当前的形势，社会党要求立即举行社会党和自由民主党两党的正式会谈，作出结论，让政府执行，并且派遣国会代表到中国去。
    社会党指出，“从根本上解决问题的办法是，自由民主党改变它的追随美国的外交，制订争取日本真正独立的外交方针。”
    声明还说，日本社会党的对中国的政策的基本方针是：放弃追随美国的外交，确立独立自主的外交方针，同一切国家的国民建立友好关系；同中华人民共和国进行政治、经济、文化和其他方面的全面交流，增进两国的友好关系，设法正式恢复邦交；支持中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权。声明说，为了实现上述基本方针，社会党一贯地进行了努力，获得了舆论的支持。
