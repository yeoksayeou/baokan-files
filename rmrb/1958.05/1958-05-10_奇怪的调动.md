Strange Transfer

　　On April 2nd, just after starting work, three aerial survey personnel waiting for job assignments arrived at the Personnel Department of the Henan Provincial Bureau of Geology. This surprised us because we had not requested such personnel.

　　After they introduced themselves, they said that they were aerial survey personnel from the Aerial Survey Team of the Surveying and Mapping Bureau of the Ministry of Geology. On March 20th, they were introduced by the Personnel Section of the team headquarters to the "Henan Geological Bureau Office" in Changsha, Hunan, for job assignments. After arriving at the Hunan Geological Bureau, the personnel department saw that the procedures were incorrect. The letter of introduction clearly stated "Henan Geological Bureau Office," and they also did not need this type of personnel. They made a long-distance call to the Xi'an Detachment Headquarters for instructions, and the reply was: "Borrow travel expenses from the Hunan Provincial Bureau and go to Henan quickly." They followed the instructions and immediately came to Henan. Here, they didn't know either, so they had to send another telegram to the team headquarters for instructions. On April 3rd, they received a reply telegram saying: "Return to Xi'an immediately."

　　At this point, things are very clear. The travel expenses alone wasted eight hundred yuan, not to mention other losses. The occurrence of such a thing during the rectification campaign should attract attention.

### 奇怪的调动

    奇怪的调动
    4月2日刚上班，河南省地质局人事处来了三名等待分配工作的航测人员。这使我们很惊奇，因为我们没有要求调这样的人员。
    经他们自我介绍：他们是地质部测绘局航空测量队的航测人员，3月20日由队部人事科介绍去湖南长沙“河南地质局办事处”分配工作。到湖南地质局后，人事部门一看手续不对，介绍信上明明写的是“河南地质局办事处”，同时，他们又不要这类人员。他们打长途电话向西安大队部请示，回复说：“向湖南省局借路费，速去河南”。他们遵照指示，立即来到河南。这里也不知道，只好再向队部打电报请示，4月3日接到复电报说：“速回西安”。
    到这里，事情很清楚了。光是他们的旅费就浪费了八百元，不用说其他损失了。在整风中出现这样的事情，应该引起注意。
