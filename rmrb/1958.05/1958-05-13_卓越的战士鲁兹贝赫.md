　　The Outstanding Warrior Rouzbeh
　　Khosrow Rouzbeh was the leader of the Iranian communist party, the People's Party, and an outstanding warrior for the Iranian people's struggle for independence, democracy, and peace. From his youth, Rouzbeh participated in the revolutionary struggle of the Iranian working people and was deeply loved by the Iranian people. During World War II, he conducted extensive political activities to defend his country's national independence. In 1947, Rouzbeh was arrested, but he soon escaped from the clutches of the enemy. A year later, he was arrested again and sentenced to death. Due to the firm protests of world public opinion at the time, the Iranian authorities were forced to cancel the death sentence and change it to fifteen years of hard labor. In 1954, Rouzbeh escaped again. At that time, the People's Party had been declared illegal by the Iranian authorities, so he began a difficult underground struggle.
　　On July 7, 1957, Rouzbeh was arrested once again and illegally sent to a military court for trial. The Iranian authorities subjected Rouzbeh to severe torture and various persecutions, but he remained heroic and unyielding. On February 25th of this year, the Iranian military court conducted a secret trial and sentenced him to death. On May 11, the Iranian authorities, disregarding the unanimous protests of all sectors of the Iranian people and world public opinion, outrageously executed Rouzbeh. Rouzbeh shouted revolutionary slogans and died heroically. (Zhen)

　　卓越的战士鲁兹贝赫
    霍斯劳·鲁兹贝赫是伊朗共产主义政党——人民党的领袖，伊朗人民争取独立、民主和和平的卓越战士。从少年时代起，鲁兹贝赫就参加了伊朗劳动人民的革命斗争，深受伊朗人民的爱戴。第二次世界大战期间，他为捍卫祖国的民族独立进行了广泛的政治活动。1947年，鲁兹贝赫被捕，但不久就逃出了敌人的魔掌。过了一年，再度被捕，并被判处死刑。由于当时世界舆论的坚决抗议，伊朗当局被迫取消死刑，改判十五年苦役。1954年鲁兹贝赫再次脱逃。当时，人民党已被伊朗当局宣布为非法，因此，他便开始了艰巨的地下斗争。
    1957年7月7日，鲁兹贝赫又一次被捕，并且被非法送交军事法庭审讯。伊朗当局对鲁兹贝赫施行了严刑拷打和种种迫害，但他始终英勇不屈。今年2月25日，伊朗军事法庭进行一次秘密审讯后，将他判处死刑。5月11日，伊朗当局悍然不顾伊朗各界人民和世界舆论的一致抗议，竟将鲁兹贝赫处死。鲁兹贝赫高呼革命口号，慷慨就义。　（真）
