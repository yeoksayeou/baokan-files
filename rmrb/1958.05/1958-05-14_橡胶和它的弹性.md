　　Rubber and Its Elasticity
　　Xia Lu
　　Around 1700 AD, a group of French geologists went to South America. One of them, named Condamine, discovered that the local natives could waterproof cloth by treating it with the sap of a certain tree; by coating clay models with layers of this sap, they could make various utensils. This tree is what we now call the rubber tree.

　　The sap of the rubber tree is what we now call rubber latex. It is a milky liquid of rubber, protein, carbohydrates, and other mixtures in water. If you dip a cloth or clay model into rubber latex and then put it in the sun to dry, the water in the latex evaporates, leaving a thin film. By repeating this process multiple times, a thicker layer of rubber can be left behind. The natives at that time were able to use rubber latex to make waterproof cloth and various crude and simple rubber utensils using this principle. If acetic acid is added to the rubber latex, the rubber precipitates. After drying and smoking, it becomes natural raw rubber.

　　Natural rubber is composed of large molecules of isoprene (an unsaturated compound made of carbon and hydrogen atoms) combined in a certain way. In rubber, these large molecules are curled or entangled together. So, when we pull it with force, these molecules stretch; when we let go, these molecules contract and return to their original state. This is the elasticity of rubber. Because rubber has this property, it can be used to manufacture rubber clothing, rubber shoes, airplane and car tires, etc. Its use has penetrated into all sectors of daily life, transportation, telecommunications, and the defense industry.

　　Raw rubber swells when it encounters oils, becomes sticky at relatively high temperatures, and loses its elasticity and hardens at relatively low temperatures. At the same time, it is easily deteriorated and aged by the action of sunlight and oxygen in the air. We now know that by mixing sulfur with raw rubber and heating it, the resistance to oils, temperature, sunlight, and oxygen is greatly enhanced. This is the vulcanization of rubber.

　　The production of natural rubber is ultimately limited. Currently, people are able to use alcohol, calcium carbide, petroleum waste gas, and coal tar as raw materials to synthesize various types of synthetic rubber, each with its own unique uses.

　　Some synthetic rubbers are less permeable to air than natural rubber, making them suitable for making balloons and inner tubes; some are particularly resistant to chemicals, being resistant to both acids and alkalis, making them suitable for manufacturing conveyor belts and tank linings in chemical plants; some have better insulation properties than natural rubber, making them more suitable for manufacturing wire and cable sheathing and other insulation materials; some maintain their elasticity at both high and very low temperatures, making them suitable for manufacturing high- and low-temperature resistant rubber products.

　　橡胶和它的弹性
　　夏露
    公元1700百年左右，有一群法国的地质学家到了南美洲，其中有一位名叫康达明的，发现当地的土人把布用一种树的树汁处理后就可以防水；把用粘土做好的模型上涂上一层层这种树汁后，就可以做出许多器皿来。这种树，就是现在我们所说的橡胶树。
    橡胶树汁就是我们现在所说的橡胶乳。它是橡胶、蛋白质、醣类等混合物在水中的乳状液。如果把布或粘土作的模型放在橡胶乳中浸一下，然后放在太阳下晒，乳的水份跑走后就变成一层很薄的膜，这样多次重复处理后，就可以留下一层比较厚的橡胶层了。当时土人所以能够用橡胶乳制造防水布和各种粗糙而简陋的橡胶器皿，就是利用这个原理。如果在橡胶乳中加入醋酸，橡胶就沉淀下来，再经过干燥、烟熏，就成为天然的生橡胶。
    天然橡胶是由异戊二烯（由碳原子和氢原子结合成的一种不饱和化合物）按一定方式结合成的大分子所组成。在橡胶中，这种大分子是卷曲着的，或者相互纠缠在一起，所以当我们用力拉它时，这些分子就伸长，松手时，这些分子又收缩恢复到原来的状态，这就是橡胶的弹性。由于橡胶具有这种性能，所以它可以用来制造橡皮衣、胶鞋、飞机和汽车的轮胎……等。它的用途已经渗透到日常生活、交通、电讯、国防工业的各个部门。
    生橡胶遇到油类就发胀，在比较高的温度下就发粘，在比较低的温度下却又失去弹性而变硬，同时容易受日光和空气中氧气的作用而变质老化。现在我们已经知道，把硫和生橡胶混在一起加热处理后，对于油类、温度、日光以及氧气的抵抗力都大大地增强了，这就是橡胶的硫化。
    天然橡胶的产量毕竟有限，目前人们已经能够利用酒精、电石、石油废气和煤焦油作原料，合成各种各样的人造橡胶，使它们各具独特的用处。
    人造橡胶中有的比天然橡胶还不容易透气，适于做气球和内胎；有的特别耐化学药品，既不怕酸也不怕碱，适于制造化学工厂中的运输带和贮槽的衬里；有的绝缘性能比天然橡胶好，更适合于制造电线、电缆的包皮和其他的绝缘材料；有的在高温和很低的温度下，都保持它的弹性，适于制造耐高温和低温的橡胶制品。
