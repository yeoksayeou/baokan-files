Respect the Old, Cherish the Young
Beijing Hengjie Residents United in Selflessness and Mutual Assistance

Our newspaper reports (reporter Miao Yiqin): In the Hengjie area of ​​Dongsi District in Beijing, a communist moral quality of "if one family has a problem, the whole courtyard helps; if one courtyard has a problem, the whole street helps" is replacing the selfish and self-serving thinking of "everyone sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, and doesn't care about the frost on others' roofs" of the past.

I walked into No. 38 Hengjie, a large courtyard that has been praised as a "unity courtyard" after the rectification campaign. Before the rectification campaign, many old ladies and old men didn't know who lived in the same courtyard, and quarrels were commonplace. Now, it's not just about living in harmony, it's about sharing weal and woe. There is an old man named Zhang Degui, who is over eighty years old. Although he has a daughter, she is weak and sick and cannot take care of him, so he is practically destitute. In the past, because no one would sew or mend for him, he was often thinly clothed even in the cold winter months. After the rectification campaign, this old man's difficulties became everyone's difficulties. Last year, before the severe winter arrived, an old lady in the same courtyard, Yue Yaqing, thought of this old man when she was making cotton clothes for her relatives. Fearing that the old man was old and weak and could not withstand illness, she put aside her relatives' cotton clothes and started making a set of cotton clothes for the old man early and late. When old lady Yue Yaqing brought the soft and warm new cotton clothes to Zhang Degui, this old man, who had not shed tears for many years, was moved to tears. In the home of old lady Zhang Shufang, I saw her daughter-in-law affectionately and carefully patting a chubby baby to sleep. I thought: this must be Zhang Shufang's grandson, and asked her: How old is your grandson? Who knew she would say: This is the grandson of old lady Zhang Wenqing, who lives next door. Zhang Wenqing's daughter was transferred to work in the frontier last year. It was inconvenient to take the child with her, so she left him with her mother. Who knew that her mother has been sick on and off this spring and couldn't take care of the child. Everyone in the courtyard is helping her take care of him. As we were talking, Zhang Wenqing came in. When she heard us talking about the child, she quickly interjected: Everyone in our courtyard has become this child's volunteer nanny! Usually, as soon as the child cries, many people immediately rush to hold him.

Not only are people "as close as a family" in the large courtyard, but many single-family residents have also formed deep friendships. Only the Cui Yi family lives at No. 19 Hengjie. Last Sunday, Cui went to participate in voluntary labor. The residents' committee considered that she had two children aged seven or eight and advised her not to go, but she insisted on going. She said: The children are older and can participate in labor and exercise themselves. The only thing to worry about is their meals, but thinking of everyone's mutual care after the rectification campaign, I can rest assured. Sure enough, she was right. After she left, the neighbors took turns cooking for the children every day. On the twelfth, when I went to visit, Grandma Zhang from No. 20 was coincidentally steaming cornbread, cooking porridge, and stir-frying chives for the children. This Sunday, Chen Zhengxin from No. 21 took her own children to play on the street and took these two children along as well. No wonder an old lady near sixty at No. 38 Hengjie would say these words: In the past, no one cared about anyone, and everyone complained about everyone. Now, no one can live without anyone, and everyone is afraid of wronging anyone. She also said that she has lived here for nearly thirty years, and now she truly feels that this large courtyard is lovely, and that the people in this large courtyard are lovely.

### 老人之老　幼人之幼  北京横街居民亲密团结克己互助

　　老人之老　幼人之幼
    北京横街居民亲密团结克己互助
    本报讯　记者缪宜勤报道：在北京市东四区横街一带，“一家有事，全院帮忙，一院有事，全街帮忙”的共产主义道德品质，正在代替过去的“各人自扫门前雪，不管他人瓦上霜”的自私自利思想。
    我走进横街三十八号，这一个整风后被人们誉为“团结院”的大杂院，在整风以前，许多老太太、老大爷都不大清楚同院住的是些什么人，吵嘴更是家常便饭；现在，岂止是和睦共处，简直是患难与共了。有一个叫张德贵的老人，八十多岁了，虽然有一个女儿，可是体弱多病，不能照顾他，他等于无依无靠。过去因为没有人给他缝缝补补，常常到了寒冬腊月，还是衣单被薄。经过整风，这一位老人的困难变成了大家的困难。去年，严冬还没有来临，同院的岳雅清老太太想起给自己的亲人缝制棉衣的时候，就想起了这位老人。她怕老人年老体弱，受不了病，就丢下自己亲人的棉衣，先给老人起早带晚缝制了一套棉衣。当岳雅清老太太拿着又软又暖的新棉衣送到张德贵面前时，这一位多少年来没有掉过泪的老人，曾感动得老泪纵横。在张淑芳老太太家里，我看见她的儿媳正在亲热地、小心地拍着一个胖娃娃睡觉。我想：这必是张淑芳的孙子无疑了，就问她：你的孙子多大了，谁知她说：这是邻居张文清老太太的孙子。张文清的姑娘去年调到边疆去工作，这个孩子带去不方便，就寄在妈妈这里。谁知妈妈今年春天三天两天闹病，没法照顾孩子，院里大伙儿都帮助她带。正说话间，张文清进来了，她听见我们正谈论孩子，连忙抢着说：咱院所有的人都成了这孩子的义务保姆啦！平时，只要孩子一哭，立即有许多人来抢着抱。
    不仅在大杂院“亲如一家”，许多单门独户的居民也结成了深厚的友谊。横街十九号只有崔毅一家，上礼拜天，崔去参加义务劳动，当时居民委员会考虑到她有两个七、八岁的孩子，劝她不要去，可她一定要去，她说：孩子大了，自己可以去参加劳动锻炼，就是孩子吃饭要照应一下，不过，一想起整风后大家互相关心的劲儿，就完全放心了。果然不出她所料，她去以后，左邻右舍每天轮流帮孩子烧饭，十二号那天，正当我去访问，恰巧二十号的张大妈在给孩子蒸窝窝头，熬稀饭、炒韭菜。这一个礼拜天，二十一号的陈正心带着自己的孩子上大街玩，就把这两个孩子也捎上了。难怪横街三十八号一个年近六十的老大娘会说出这样的话：过去谁也不管谁，谁也埋怨谁，现在，谁也离不了谁，谁也怕委屈了谁。她还说她在这里住了近三十年了，现在才真正感到这个大杂院可爱，感到这个大杂院里的人可爱。
