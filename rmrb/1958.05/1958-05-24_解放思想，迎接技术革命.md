Liberate Thinking, Welcome the Technical Revolution
Wu De, First Secretary of the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

    A mass technical innovation movement has emerged on both the agricultural and industrial fronts in Jilin Province. When water flows, a channel is formed; events occur inevitably. The emergence of this movement is by no means accidental.

    The victories of the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts, as well as the rectification movement, have brought about a great liberation of people's minds and a further liberation of social productive forces. The general line of "go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the slogan of "catch up with Britain in fifteen years," and the call to "fundamentally change the face of various regions through three years of hard work" have inspired the unprecedentedly awakened people with full confidence and vigor . On the basis of giving priority to the development of heavy industry, the policy of simultaneously developing industry with agriculture, and simultaneously developing central industry and local industry, large-scale enterprises and medium and small-scale enterprises, has opened up broad avenues for accelerating the development of production, making the implementation of the technical revolution a pressing need in reality. The rectification and the "double anti" campaign have exposed and resolved contradictions in various aspects. The masses have seen the potential for production. Discussions on the leap forward plan have clarified the goals of struggle, giving people a place to use their talents. Vigor has led to a spirit of intensive study, and everyone's enthusiasm has naturally developed from increasing labor intensity to technical innovation. On the other hand, the extensive airing of views, debates, rectification, and reforms have subdued the "three winds," "five airs," and the arrogance of right-leaning conservatism. The work style of most cadres has changed, and the masses have enhanced their sense of responsibility as masters of the country. Everyone dares to boldly imagine, and the desire and wisdom for creation are bursting forth in abundance. The advanced elements among the masses are leading everyone to advance on the road of technical innovation. Technical innovation is the beginning of the technical revolution.

    Although the current technical innovation has been underway for only a short time, it can already be seen that: (1) Technical innovation is already the urgent demand of the broad masses. We have also adhered to the mass line in technical innovation work, thus making the movement have a broad mass character from the very beginning. In one place, one unit, advanced figures are leading the way, a few people are leading a group of people, and a group of people are influencing more people. Every successful reform has aroused new ideals, and the number of people who use their brains is increasing. A small snowball rolls into a big snowball, and the movement develops rapidly forward under leadership. (2) The Party's correct line and policies are mastered by the masses, so the technical innovations carried out by the masses have a clear purpose. The goals of reform are rapidly directed towards key production issues and major topics. The result of mass reform is that the leap forward production plan has obtained a more reliable material and technical guarantee, and the leap forward indicators are constantly being further improved. (3) The communist spirit has been greatly promoted, and individualism and departmentalism have been greatly reduced. More important reforms are mostly based on veteran workers and technicians as the backbone, combining the experience and wisdom of the vast number of workers, individual initiatives, collective research, and the combination of labor and technology, with everyone participating. In the design and experimentation process, relevant departments take the initiative to cooperate, "technical support each other, materials delivered to the door"; when encountering difficulties, they gather around and do not disperse, and when the experiment is successful, they spread the news to each other; everyone revolves around the common goal, launches revolutionary competitions, and encourages each other to move forward. (4) The technical innovation movement is also a mass ideological movement, which demonstrates the sharpness and clarity of the masses' opposition to right-leaning conservative thought and opposition to dogmatism and empiricism. Almost every major reform has to go through a fierce debate and struggle. In some places, the masses, while debating, obtain the support of the Party organization, boldly break through the shackles of convention, and come up with the results of experiments to answer the obstacles of certain stubborn conservatives, empiricists, and dogmatists, while also improving everyone's thinking.

    We believe that the above characteristics are sufficient to show that the technical innovation movement that has already appeared or is appearing is not an ordinary movement. This is a broad mass-based technical innovation movement with ideological vitality, full of revolutionary creative spirit, and promoting the great development of productive forces. It is the beginning of a great technical revolution. Wherever this movement is carried out, a new situation will inevitably appear in production.

    The tremendous role played by the technical innovation movement in improving productivity can be proved by the following facts: (1) In rural areas, a movement to improve agricultural implements has been launched. The masses have manufactured tens of thousands of improved agricultural implements and adopted many advanced technologies, greatly improving labor efficiency. For example, the use of "four-corner punching" and "pulling knives to break ground" and other methods for winter water conservancy construction and digging frozen soil; the promotion of rapid fermentation of peat and other methods of accumulating fertilizer; the invention of rice seeders and soybean seeders; the manufacture and creation of various simple water lifting tools. These have played a role in solving major key problems in realizing the leap forward plan for agricultural production in our province. (2) In newly built modern factories, the masses further develop new technologies on the basis of mastering new technologies; on the basis of reaching the design capacity, further strengthen technical measures and tap the potential of equipment; the results of experiments have proved that the production capacity of such factories has great potential, and some can be increased by more than double. (3) In old factories with outdated equipment, the masses widely carry out innovation of tools, improvement of design, improvement of equipment, improvement of operating methods, improvement of technological processes, and adoption of advanced technologies, so that the efficiency of many tasks has been increased by several times, ten times, dozens of times, or even hundreds of times; Wang Deze, a lathe operator at the Changchun Power Machinery Factory, carried out nine technical innovations and creations and completed eight years of production tasks in eight months; Zhou Yuling, a forger at the Jilin Provincial Machinery Factory, improved and created thirty-six kinds of tools and is now doing the work of the third quarter of 1962. After the technical innovation movement was launched, some factories achieved "rough machine tools doing fine work," "small machine tools doing big work," "old machines acting as new machines," and "low-level factories doing the work of high-level factories." In the Provincial Machinery Factory, which has only 1,780 employees, since the technical innovation movement was launched in mid-March, in just over forty days, the masses have proposed 218 innovations and creations, and 180 have been adopted after appraisal. As a result, all workers in 27 of the factory's 66 work groups have improved their work efficiency by half to more than three times, 66% of the workers have exceeded the quota by more than 80%, and 546 people have exceeded the quota for individual products by five to ten times, and 34 people have exceeded it by ten to fifty-three times. (4) In some handicraft enterprises, the masses put forward the slogan of "making great technical innovations with indigenous methods and poor methods." Some woodworking factories have realized small-scale mechanization by making their own wooden machinery, and some factories that originally produced straw ropes and straw bags have made rayon and paper pulp. (5) Among the thousands of technical innovations that have already appeared, many projects have enabled our production technology level to rapidly approach, reach, or surpass the world's advanced level. For example, the double-frequency high-frequency protection device for power transmission lines successfully tested by the Fengman Hydropower Station, according to existing data comparison, can be ranked among the best in the world among similar devices in various countries, and compared with the United States and Britain, it is more reliable and not so complicated; the wood pulp cooking time of the Shixian and Kaishantun paper mills created a record exceeding Canada within a few days. Similar projects that reach or approach the world's advanced level appeared in Jilin City alone, with 15 items in a single month of March. This shows that the international level in technology is not as high as some people say it is.

    In just a few months, so many inspiring facts have emerged, which has taught us: The people led by the Party, after being spiritually liberated, will exert such great power. We confidently believe that the comprehensive technical revolution led by the current technical innovation movement will enable the social productive forces of our country to achieve unlimited development.

Break Down Superstitions, Break Self-Abasement

    Real life has put the task of leading the technical innovation movement and the technical revolution on the agenda. Some of the situations encountered in our province in the technical innovation movement show that many leaders and business cadres of the Party still have insufficient understanding and unclear attitudes towards the purpose and significance of the mass technical innovation movement and the technical revolution. We must carry out in-depth ideological work in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, improve the understanding of cadres, break down superstitions, liberate our minds, follow the mass line, and welcome the coming of the technical revolution and cultural revolution with great historical significance.

    On scientific and technological issues, the "spiritual slave" state of cadres is even more pronounced than in other areas. Many comrades, because they do not understand natural science and modern technology, and lack correct views, often mystify science and technology, willingly belittle themselves, and believe in or fear "experts"; when the mass technical innovation movement comes, their performance is to be cautious and timid, afraid that the masses will "mess things up," and dare not support the creative initiatives and advanced initiatives of the masses, and dare not let go of the launch and bold leadership. Others do not proceed from reality, only yearn for the world's latest technological achievements and the latest modern equipment, and think that the activities of the masses to improve tools and innovate technology are "low-level" and are not interested in them. Whether it is "disdain" or "dare not," it is a negative attitude, which is behind the situation and behind the reality.

    The road of technical revolution in our country is to adopt the world's latest technological achievements as much as possible. On the other hand, it must be combined with the widespread mass movement of improved tools and technical innovation. This will not only enable our major industrial sectors to obtain modern technical equipment, but also improve the technical level of widespread manual labor and a large number of old equipment, increase labor efficiency many times, and prepare conditions for future transformation to modern large-scale production. Taking this road will enable the level of production technology in our country to develop forward at a leap forward speed, thereby changing the face of our country's low technical level and economic backwardness, and consolidating and strengthening the socialist economic base of our country in the shortest possible historical period. At the same time, only by taking this road can we meet and satisfy the urgent demands of the broad masses for technical innovation and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses to build socialism. Therefore, in the process of technical revolution, the leadership must have the spirit of striving for excellence in the mass technical innovation movement and stand in front of the movement to lead the masses.

    With a positive attitude, there must also be a communist originality and revolutionary style. Because technical innovation is a mass creative movement, on the one hand, it is reforming machines and tools, and on the other hand, it is continuing to transform people's minds. Technical innovation is the opposite of conservative thinking, dogmatism, and empiricism. Its development process is full of the struggle between new ideas and old ideas, advanced ideas and backward ideas. We have already seen that this movement, as soon as it appears, encounters the superstition that "the masses cannot innovate technology"; every major innovation encounters the obstruction of "conditionalism," "bookishness," and national inferiority; during the experimental process, it encounters various obstacles of outdated rules and regulations; in the process of innovation, there are often ideological disputes involving lines, policies, and construction methods, such as leap forward versus slow advance, greater, faster, better, and more economical results versus less, slower, worse, and more expensive, active balance versus vulgar balance, and so on. Under the shackles and obstruction of these conservative and backward ideas, the masses have demonstrated the fighting spirit of sweeping away everything and the creative spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, daring to experiment, and daring to do. However, whether the masses can move forward smoothly on the innovation road full of struggle depends on the correct leadership of the Party. Facts have proved that wherever the leadership resolutely implements the Party's construction line, has a communist revolutionary style, and can actively support and lead the masses, the revolutionary will and creative spirit of the masses can be fully developed, and various obstacles and difficulties can be overcome batch by batch, innovations and experiments are realized one by one, and awareness and confidence are further improved; conservative and backward ideas are criticized by facts, more people's minds are liberated, and the movement moves forward by leaps and bounds. Conversely, the masses are suppressed and the movement cannot move forward.

    Here are two examples of factories to illustrate the role and significance of leadership attitudes and ideas for the development of the technical innovation movement.

    The first is the example of the Party Committee of the First Automobile Factory leading all employees to conduct a major review of the factory's production capacity and a major experiment of "one hundred parts per shift." Their bold creative spirit not only proved that the equipment capacity can be increased by more than double at once, realizing the production leap forward of "one factory becoming two factories"; but also opened the way for the factory to carry out comprehensive management reform and major technical reform.

    Another example is the technical reform experiment of the original Huadian Petroleum No. 9 Factory (now merged into Huadian Shale Oil Company). The "oil shale pile dry distillation method" successfully tested by the factory in 1956 was a method of extracting oil that Germany had once experimented with and adopted during World War II, but was considered a failure. The results of the factory's experiments and production show that this method can maximize the use of small pieces of shale and shale debris, and the oil yield is also increased to a level equivalent to the Huadian-style furnace in the factory. It is technically completely successful; especially because this method has simple equipment, uncomplicated technical operation, low investment, and quick results, it is suitable for local industries to establish small oil factories (a factory with an annual output of 1,000 tons has an investment of less than 100,000 yuan and can be built in less than three months), and is also very valuable from an economic point of view. However, the success of this technical creation originated from a sharp struggle between two kinds of ideas. The factory originally faced the fate of closing down because of backward equipment, backward production, and failure to complete the plan and lose money year after year. At that time, to change the situation, it was necessary to increase the shale utilization rate and increase the oil output. Comrade Jia Chenglie, the factory director and secretary of the Party Committee, was a "layman" in technology, but he saw the important position of the petroleum industry in national construction, cared about increasing crude oil production for the country, and had a firm idea of relying on the working class and running enterprises diligently, and painstakingly sought a way out for improving production. Starting from the situation in his factory, he decided to take advantage of the large amount of discarded shale debris. He was inspired by the phenomenon of shale spontaneously igniting and flowing oil, and happened to see relevant information, so he boldly decided to conduct the "pile dry distillation" experiment. This proposal was initially opposed by some technical leaders inside and outside the factory, who believed that this decision was "nonsense," saying that "it is a matter of God's knowledge that oil can be extracted from soil methods and rotten pipes"; as for how to increase production and reduce costs, their proposal was "only to increase new equipment." This kind of thinking that does not proceed from reality, seeks new and big things, and conserves and promotes regression is in sharp opposition to the correct thinking of the factory director and the Party Committee. After the explosion accident occurred during the experiment, the engineer wanted to resign and quit, and some technicians said: "The factory that is going to be shut down should close down"; individual leaders of the higher-level leadership department also persuaded the factory leaders: "Make your own decision about whether to do it or not, this is not pouring cold water on you!" In this case, the factory director and the Party Committee neither discouraged nor retreated in the face of difficulties; the vast number of employees were also very concerned about this experiment, especially some veteran workers were even more unwilling to be confused and give up halfway. In this way, the perseverance of the leadership and the enthusiasm of the masses were combined, and with the spirit of "restarting the gong and opening a new business," the cause of the explosion was carefully examined, necessary conclusions were drawn, lessons were learned, arduous ideological work was carried out, technical measures and safety measures were actively taken, equipment was repaired, and furnace experiments were started. The technical problems encountered were solved by the joint efforts of the workers and the advanced technicians, and the experiment was finally successful and put into production. The success of the "pile dry distillation method" on the one hand refuted the argument that "politics cannot lead technology" and "laymen cannot lead experts," proving that there must be strong political leadership of the Party, and there must be a correct direction, so that technical work can fully play its role in production, and technology itself can be better developed and improved; on the other hand, it refuted the argument that "workers do not understand technology, and the masses cannot innovate technology," proving that it is precisely the workers who are despised by those who regard themselves as "noble" and "smart" who dare to think, dare to do, hold on to the truth, and can really create something; therefore, technical innovation must rely on them and must not be separated from them. This ideological harvest made the factory's technical innovation movement gain a further solid foundation for development. Since the rectification, the "gas-fired square furnace" that combines the advantages of the three kinds of oil refining furnaces in the Soviet Union, Fushun, and Huadian has also been successfully tested and put into production in March of this year; in April, according to the new technology and experience of the Soviet Union, the experiment of small-scale gasification (underground dry distillation) has begun, and preliminary results have been obtained. However, in this factory, the current technical innovation movement is still encountering obstacles of various wrong ideas. For example, some technicians are still satirizing the creative labor result of the "pile dry distillation method" as "local" and "strange"; some people also disapprove of the phenomenon of the factory's modern oil refining furnace and the cattle-drawn "roller horse" coexisting at the same time. This shows that the struggle between advanced and backward ideas will always exist, and it is necessary to always maintain a revolutionary fighting style, to use "virtual" to lead "real," to let go and mobilize the masses, to boldly break down obstacles, to combine leadership, the masses, and technology, to combine innovation, creation, learning, and practice, and to adopt the method of individual breakthroughs, comprehensive expansion, repeated experiments, and repeated summarization to make the movement continue to move forward.

Fearing that the masses will "mess things up" is unfounded.

    The masses are fully reliable. It is unfounded for some people to fear that the masses will "mess things up." The masses who have awakened have a sense of responsibility as masters in politics. This awareness is reflected in production, which is to make themselves the masters of nature and make their labor produce greater efficiency, make more contributions to socialism, and not be content with being passive users of tools and machines. In this way, in the technical innovation movement, the masses show that creative spirit that does not believe in superstitions, gets rid of shackles, pays attention to practice, grasps the initiative, and makes things subordinate to people. Under this spirit, the masses can exert the greatest wisdom, and will give life to tools and machines, making them as docile as living things; when people are liberated, tools and machines also become active. Such masses are very lovely and not at all scary; the precious creative spirit of the masses should be trusted and not doubted. If it is said that the masses will "mess up" something, it is to break the unreasonable rules and regulations that bind productive forces, and to break down the stubborn fortresses that restrict the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses; and such "chaos" is precisely "governance," and such "destruction" is precisely "establishment." Of course, in the broad mass technical innovation, some experiments may not be successful, and even such problems may occur, but this cannot be completely avoided in any movement or any work. As long as we pay attention to it regularly and make timely adjustments, we can avoid major errors.

    Technical innovation and technical revolution cannot be separated from the guidance of experts and should actively play their role; ignoring the role of technical personnel is wrong. After the in-depth rectification, the "double anti" movement and ideological transformation, the situation of the technical personnel team has undergone new changes and progress; many advanced technical personnel have played a major role in technical innovation, and their relationship with the Party and the masses is improving day by day. As for the experts who are divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, do not combine production labor, and only see things but not people, we should continue to educate and transform them in accordance with the requirements of "both red and expert" so that they can play an active role in the technical revolution. Therefore, it is unreasonable to "fear experts." Do not think that those dogmatism and outdated rules and regulations that hinder the development of productive forces are inviolable. As long as the revolutionary creative movement of the masses rises, those things will certainly be embarrassed in the face of the masses and reality. There are such examples: in order to make it easier to work, the workers made a clever small pair of pliers themselves; a craftsman who boasted of being "clever" and "following the rules" said: "Making your own tools violates the process, it is not good, and you can't use it! I will design a pair of pliers that meet the process requirements for you!" The pliers designed by the craftsman were brought, and the workers laughed dumbly when they saw it; it turned out that the weight of the pliers was three kilograms, but the parts to be clamped were only four liang. The workers took the pliers from the craftsman's hand and were even more dumbfounded; everyone said strangely: "How did you make a reverse pliers!" The inexplicable craftsman widened his eyes and asked: "Are there reverse pliers?" The workers kindly taught him: "We are not blacksmiths, so we have to use our right hand to hold the pliers." Such a small example is worth pondering for those who have similar problems, and it is also very helpful for us to liberate our minds.

    We must improve our understanding, liberate our minds, rely on the masses, and welcome the technical revolution with a communist creative spirit and revolutionary style. We must strengthen leadership, put politics in command, and combine political leadership and technical leadership well. At the same time, in conjunction with the technical innovation movement, we must launch a large-scale movement to learn scientific knowledge and technology in factories, enterprises, and rural areas, carry out scientific research work, and cultivate a large number of technical talents in order to gradually improve on the basis of preliminary technical innovation.

    解放思想，迎接技术革命
    中共吉林省委第一书记　吴德
    在吉林省的农业战线上和工业战线上，群众性的技术革新运动都已出现。水到渠成，事有必至；这个运动的出现决不是偶然的。
    思想战线上和政治战线上的社会主义革命，以及整风运动的胜利，带来人们思想的大解放和社会生产力的进一步解放。党中央和毛主席提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，十五年赶上英国的口号，苦战三年基本上改变各个地区的面貌的号召，鼓舞着空前觉悟了的人民，信心百倍，干劲十足。在优先发展重工业的基础上，发展工业和发展农业同时并举，中央工业和地方工业、大型企业和中小型企业同时并举的方针，给加速发展生产开辟了广阔的道路，实行技术革命也就成为现实的迫切需要。整风、“双反”揭发了和解决着各方面的矛盾，群众看到了生产潜力的所在，讨论跃进计划又明确了奋斗目标，使人们有了用武之地，干劲引起钻劲，大家的积极性顺乎自然地从提高劳动强度向技术革新方面发展。另一方面，大鸣大放、大争大辩、大整大改、煞了“三风”、“五气”和右倾保守主义的威风，多数干部作风有了转变，群众增强了国家主人翁的责任感，大家敢于大胆设想了，创造的欲望和智慧，就源源迸发出来。群众中的先进部分就带动大家在技术革新的道路上进军。技术革新是技术革命的开端
    目前出现的技术革新虽为时尚短，但已经可以看出：（一）技术革新已是当前广大群众的迫切要求，我们在技术革新工作中同样坚持了群众路线，因而使运动一开始就带有广泛的群众性。在一个地方，一个单位，大都是先进人物带头，少数人带起一群人，一群人影响更多人；每项改革成功，又都引起新的理想，开动脑筋的人越来越多，小雪球滚成大雪球，运动有领导地迅速向前发展。（二）党的正确的路线、方针为群众所掌握，因而群众所进行的技术革新有着明确的目的性。改革的目标，迅速指向生产关键和重大课题；群众性改革的结果，使生产跃进计划得到了更可靠的物质基础和技术保证，并且不断地把跃进指标进一步提高。（三）共产主义精神大大发扬，个人主义、本位主义大大减少。比较重要的改革，多以老工人和技术人员为骨干，结合广大职工的经验和智慧，个别倡议，集体研究，劳技结合，大家动手。在设计和试验过程中，有关部门主动协作，“技术互相支援，材料送货上门”；遇到困难，围着不散，试验成功，奔走相告；大家围绕着共同的目的，展开革命竞赛，互相鼓舞前进。（四）技术革新运动也是群众性的思想运动，在运动中表现了群众反对右倾保守思想和反对教条主义、经验主义的尖锐性、鲜明性。每项重大改革几乎都要经过一场激烈辩论和斗争；有些地方，群众一面辩论，一面取得党组织的支持，大胆地突破陈规陋矩的束缚，拿出试验的结果，来回答某些顽固的保守主义者和经验主义者、教条主义者的阻难，同时提高了大家的思想。
    我们认为，上述特点足够说明目前已经或正在出现的技术革新运动，不是一个普通的运动。这是一个广大群众性的、富有思想活力的、充满革命创造精神的、推动生产力大发展的技术革新运动，是伟大的技术革命的开端。这个运动在那里开展起来，那里生产上就必然出现新的局面。
    技术革新运动对提高生产力所发生的巨大作用，从下列事实可以得到证明：（一）在农村，掀起了一个改良农具运动。群众制造了成千上万件改良农具，采用了许多先进技术，大大提高了劳动效率。例如，使用“四角打眼”、“拉刀破土”等严冬水利施工、挖掘冻土的方法；推广草炭快速发酵等积肥方法；发明了水稻点播机、大豆点播机；制造和创造了各种简易提水工具。这些在实现我省农业生产的跃进计划中，都起了解决重大的关键问题的作用。（二）在新建的现代化工厂，群众在掌握新技术的基础上进一步发展新技术；在达到设计能力的基础上进一步加强技术措施，发挥设备潜力；试验的结果证明，这类工厂的生产能力都有很大潜力，有的可以提高一倍以上。（三）在设备陈旧的老厂，群众广泛进行革新工具，改进设计，改进设备，改进操作方法，改进工艺过程，采用先进技术，使许多工作的效率，提高了几倍、十倍、几十倍以至几百倍；长春市动力机械厂车工王德泽搞了九项技术革新和创造，八个月完成了八年的生产任务；吉林市省机械厂锻工周玉岭改进和创造了三十六种工具，现在正干着1962年第三季度的工作。技术革新运动开展以后，有些厂子作到了“粗床干细活”，“小床干大活”，“老机器当新机器”，“低级厂干高级厂的活”。在只有一千七百八十名职工的省机械厂，从3月中旬掀起技术革新运动，仅仅四十几天的时间，群众就提出了革新和创造二百一十八件，经鉴定采纳一百八十件，结果全厂六十六个工组，有二十七个工组的全部工人提高工作效率半倍到三倍以上，66％的工人突破了80％以上的定额，单项产品超过定额五倍至十倍的五百四十六人，十倍以上至五十三倍的三十四人。（四）在一些手工业企业里，群众提出“以土办法、穷办法大闹技术革新”的口号，有的木工厂用自制木机械的办法，实现了小型机械化，有的原来生产草绳、草袋的工厂，制出了人造棉和纸浆。（五）在已经出现的千百件技术革新中，有不少项目已使我们的某些生产技术的水平，迅速接近、达到或者超过了世界先进水平。如丰满水力发电厂试验成功的送电线双周率高周波保护装置，根据现有资料对照，在世界各国同类装置中，是可以名列前茅的，同美英两国的相较，比他们的可靠，又不那样复杂；石岘、开山屯两个造纸厂的木浆蒸煮时间，在几天之内创造了超过加拿大的纪录。类此达到或接近世界先进水平的项目，仅仅吉林市的各厂，一个3月份，就出现十五项。这就表明，技术方面的国际水平，并不像有些人所说的那样高不可攀。
    在短短的几个月内，出现了这样许多振奋人心的事实，这就教育了我们：党所领导下的人民群众，得到了精神的解放以后，会发挥出多么伟大的力量。我们肯定地相信：目前的技术革新运动所导向的全面的技术革命，必将使我国的社会生产力得到不可限量的大发展。
  破除迷信，打破自甘菲薄
    现实生活已经把领导技术革新运动和技术革命的任务，提到议事日程上来。我省在技术革新运动中遇到的一些情况，说明目前党的和企业的许多领导干部，对于群众技术革新运动和技术革命的目的、意义，认识还很不足，态度还不明确。我们必须根据党中央和毛主席的指示，进行深入的思想工作，提高干部的认识，破除迷信，解放思想，走群众路线，迎接有伟大历史意义的技术革命和文化革命的到来。
    在科学技术问题上，干部中的“精神奴隶”状态比在其他方面更甚。许多同志由于自己不懂自然科学和现代技术，又缺乏正确的观点，往往把科学技术神秘化，自甘菲薄，迷信或害怕“专家”；群众性的技术革新运动一来，他们的表现是畏首畏尾，缩手缩脚，害怕群众会把事情“搞乱”，不敢支持群众的创举和先进倡议，不敢放手发动和大胆领导。另一些人，不从实际出发，只向往世界最新技术成就和现代化的最新设备，对于群众改良工具和革新技术的活动，认为是“低级”的东西，不感兴趣，不屑过问。“不屑”也好，“不敢”也好，都是消极态度，都是落后于形势，落后于实际的。
    我国技术革命的道路，一方面是要尽可能采用世界上的最新技术成就，另方面必须与广泛群众性的改良工具和技术革新运动结合起来，这样既能使我国主要工业部门获得现代化的技术装备，又能使广泛的手工劳动和众多的旧设备的技术水平得到提高，劳动效率得到许多倍的增长，并为将来转向现代化的大生产准备好条件。采取这条道路，将使我国生产技术水平以跃进的速度向前发展，从而改变我国技术水平低下和经济落后的面貌，使我国社会主义的经济基础在尽短的历史时期内得到巩固和加强。同时，也只有采取这条道路，才能符合和满足广大群众对于革新技术的迫切要求，充分发挥群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造性。因此，在技术革命的过程中，对于群众性的技术革新运动，领导上必须有力争上游的精神，站到运动前面去领导群众。
    有了积极态度，还需要有共产主义的独创精神和革命风格。因为技术革新是一个群众性的创造运动，一方面改革着机器和工具，一方面继续改造人们的思想。技术革新是保守思想、教条主义、经验主义的对立物，它的发展过程充满着新思想对旧思想、先进思想对落后思想的斗争。我们已经看到了：这个运动一出现就遇到“群众不能革新技术”的迷信；每项重大革新的提出都遇到“条件论”、“书本主义”和民族自卑思想的阻挠；试验过程中，又碰到各种陈规陋矩的障碍；革新的过程中也常常发生跃进与缓进，多快好省与少慢差费，积极平衡与庸俗平衡等等涉及路线、方针和建设方法的思想争论。在这些保守落后思想的束缚、阻挠之下，群众表现了势如破竹的战斗锐气，和敢想、敢说、敢试、敢干的创造精神。但是群众在充满斗争的革新道路上能否顺利前进，取决于党的正确领导。事实证明，凡是领导上坚决贯彻执行党的建设路线，具有共产主义革命风格，能够积极支持和领导群众的地方，群众的革命意志和创造精神就能够得到充分发扬，就能够把各种障碍和困难一批一批地克服下去，革新和试验一项一项地实现了，觉悟和信心更加提高了；保守落后的思想受到了事实的批判，更多人的思想得到解放，运动大步前进了。反之，群众就受到压抑，运动就不能前进。
    这里举两个工厂的例子，说明领导的态度和思想对于发展技术革新运动的作用和意义。
    头一个是第一汽车厂党委领导全体职工进行全厂生产能力大检阅、“班产百辆份”大试验的例子。他们的大胆创造精神不仅一下证明了设备能力可以提高一倍以上，实现了“一厂变两厂”的生产跃进；而且打开了工厂全面进行管理大改革和技术大改革的道路。
    另一个例子，是原桦甸石油九厂（现并入桦甸页岩油公司）进行技术改革试验的情况。该厂在1956年试验成功的“油页岩成堆干馏法”，是过去德国在第二次世界大战时期曾经试验、采用，但被认为失败的一种提油方法。现在该厂试验和进行生产的结果证明：这种方法可以最大限度地利用小块页岩和页岩碎末，出油率也提高到与该厂桦甸式炉相当的水平，在技术上完全是成功的；特别由于这种方法设备简单，技术操作不复杂，投资少，收效快，适于地方工业建立小型油厂（一个年产千吨的厂，投资在十万元以下，不出三个月就可建成），从经济意义上说，也是很有价值的。但是，这项技术创造的成功，是从两种思想的一场尖锐斗争中产生的。这个厂子原来由于设备落后，生产落后，连年完不成计划，连年赔钱，面临关厂的命运。当时要转变局面，必须提高页岩利用率，增加出油量。厂长兼党委书记贾承烈同志是一个技术上的“外行”，但他看到石油工业在国家建设中的重要地位，关心为国家增产原油，有着坚定的依靠工人阶级和勤俭办企业的思想，苦心寻找提高生产的出路。他从本厂情况出发，打主意利用大量废弃的碎页岩。他从页岩自然发火流油的现象得到启发，又恰好看到有关的资料，就大胆地决定进行“成堆干馏”的试验。这个主张一开始就遇到厂内外一些技术领导人员的反对，他们认为这个决定乃是“胡扯”，说“用土办法，烂管子能抽出油来，那是天晓得的事”；至于如何才能达到增加生产、降低成本，他们的主张则是“只有增加新式设备”。这种不从实际出发、求新求大、保守促退的思想，同厂长、党委的正确思想尖锐地对立着。在试验过程中发生爆炸事故以后，工程师要辞职不干，有的技术人员则说：“下马的厂子，应该收摊了”；上级领导部门也有个别人劝说厂的领导：“干不干自己拿主意吧，这可不是泼你们的冷水！”在这种情况下，厂长和党委既没有泄气，也没在困难面前退缩；广大职工对这一试验也十分关切，特别是一部分老工人更不肯胡里胡涂，半途而废。这样，领导的毅力和群众的热情结合起来，就以“重打锣鼓另开张”的精神，详细地检查了爆炸原因，得出了必要的结论，吸取了应得的教训，进行了艰苦的思想工作，积极采取了技术措施和安全措施，重新修设备，开炉试验。遇到的技术难题，都依靠工人群众和先进的技术人员的共同努力，获得解决，试验终于成功，并投入生产。“成堆干馏法”的试验成功，一方面驳斥了那种“政治不能领导技术”“外行不能领导内行”的说法，证明必须有党的坚强政治领导，必须有正确的方向，技术工作才能在生产上充分地发挥作用，技术本身也才能更好地获得发展和提高；另方面驳斥了那种“工人不懂技术，群众不能革新技术”的说法，证明正是被那些自视“高贵”和“聪明”的人们所看不起的劳动者，才是敢想、敢作、抓住真理不放，真正能够有所创造的人；因而技术革新必须依靠他们，而决不能脱离他们。这种思想的收获使得该厂的技术革新运动获得了进一步发展的巩固基础。整风以来，综合苏联、抚顺、桦甸三种炼油炉优点的“气燃式方形炉”，也在今年3月份试验成功投入生产了；4月份又根据苏联的新技术经验，开始了小型气化（地下干馏）的试验，现在已经获得了初步成绩。但是，在这个厂里，目前的技术革新运动，还是继续遇到了各种错误思想的障碍的，比如有的技术人员至今还在讽刺“成堆干馏法”这个创造性的劳动的成果，是“土”而“奇”；对于该厂现代化炼油炉和牛拉“轱辘马”同时并存的现象，也有些人看不上眼。这就说明先进与落后两种思想的斗争，什么时候都会存在，必须经常保持革命的战斗风格，以“虚”带“实”，放手发动群众，大胆破除障碍，把领导、群众和技术相互结合起来，把革新、创造和学习、实践相互结合起来，并且采取个别突破、全面扩展、反复试验、反复总结的方法，使运动不断向前发展。怕群众“搞乱”是没有根据的
    群众是完全可以依靠的。有些人怕群众“搞乱”，那是没有根据的。已经觉悟起来的群众，在政治上有主人翁的责任感，这种觉悟反映到生产方面，就是要使自己变成自然的主人，使自己的劳动产生更大的效率，为社会主义多作出贡献，而不安于作工具和机器的消极的使用者。这样，群众在技术革新运动中，就表现出那种毫不迷信、摆脱束缚、注重实践、掌握主动、使物服从于人的创造精神。在这种精神下，群众能够发挥最大的智慧，会把生命给予工具和机器，使它像活物一样听人使唤；人解放了，工具和机器也就有了积极性。这样的群众，是非常可爱而决没有什么可怕的；群众的那种可贵的创造精神，是应该信任而不应该怀疑的。如果说群众起来会“搞乱”什么东西，那就是打破那些束缚生产力的不合理的规章制度，冲垮那些限制群众积极性和创造性的顽固堡垒；而这样的“乱”正是“治”，这样的“破”正是“立”。当然，在广泛群众性的技术革新中，也不免有些试验会得不到成功，甚至也不免发生这样那样的问题，但这在任何运动、任何工作中，都是不能完全避免的。只要经常注意，及时加以调整，就可以避免发生大的错误。
    技术革新、技术革命，不但不能离开专家的指导，而且应该积极发挥他们的作用；忽视技术人员的作用是不对的。经过整风、“双反”运动和思想改造的深入，技术人员队伍的状况有了新的变化和进步；许多先进的技术人员在技术革新中发挥了重大的作用，他们同党、同群众的关系在日益改善。至于对那种脱离实际、脱离群众、不结合生产劳动、只见物不见人的专家，我们应该按照“又红又专”的要求，对他们继续进行教育和改造，使之在技术革命中起到积极的作用。因此，“怕专家”是没有道理的。也不要认为那些障碍生产力发展的教条主义和陈规陋矩是不可触犯的。只要群众的革命创造运动起来了，那些东西在群众和实际的面前，是一定出丑的。有这样的例子：工人为了干活方便，自己做了个灵巧的小钳子；自诩“高明”、“照章办事”的工艺师说：“自己做工具，违反工艺，不行，也不能用！我给你们设计个合乎工艺要求的钳子！”工艺师设计的钳子拿来了，工人一见就哑然失笑；原来，钳子的重量是三斤，要夹的零件却只有四两。工人把钳子从工艺师的手里接过来，更加哭笑不得了；大家奇怪地说：“怎么做了个反钳子！”莫名其妙的工艺师瞪大了眼睛问：“钳子还有反正吗？”工人善意的教训他说：“我们不是锻工，所以要用右手拿钳子”。这样一个小小的例子，很值得那些有同类毛病的人深思，也很有助于我们解放思想。
    我们必须提高认识，解放思想，依靠群众，以共产主义的创造精神和革命风格去迎接技术革命。必须加强领导，政治挂帅，使政治领导和技术领导很好地结合起来。同时要结合技术革新运动，在工厂、企业、农村中展开一个大规模的学习科学知识、学习技术的运动，开展科学研究工作，大量培养技术人材，以便在初步技术革新的基础上逐步加以提高。
