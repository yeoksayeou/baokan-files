Peasants Engage in Creative Writing

    In Xichong County, Sichuan Province, more than 230 amateur peasant writers have emerged.

    They are mostly young activists on the agricultural production front. The writing groups they form are generally attached to the local agricultural cooperatives' clubs. These peasant writers generally have a primary school education level, and some are not very literate. Based on the real people and events in the agricultural cooperatives, they create dramas, operas, Sichuan operas, storytelling performances, mountain songs, as well as local folk lantern operas and "che nao zi" (a type of folk performance) that are loved by the local masses. In the past year alone, the Xichong County Cultural Center received more than 110 large-scale works sent by these writing groups.

    The works created by the peasant writers are performed in the agricultural cooperative clubs at any time, which not only enriches the activities of the clubs, but also promotes the work.

    农民闹创作
    四川西充县出现了两百三十多个农民业余文艺作者。
    他们多半是农业生产战线上的青年积极分子。由他们组成的创作小组，一般附设在当地农业社的俱乐部里。这些农民作者一般是小学文化程度，有的识字不多。他们根据农业社里的真人真事，创作出为当地群众所喜爱的话剧、歌剧、川剧、评书、山歌以及当地民间流行的灯戏、扯闹子等。去年一年，仅西充县文化馆收到的由这些创作组寄来的大型作品就有一百一十多件。
    农民作者创作的作品都随时拿来在农业社俱乐部里演唱，不但丰富了俱乐部的活动内容，并且推动了工作。
