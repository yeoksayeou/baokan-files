    学校的矿山　矿山的学校

    本报讯　昆明工学院最近和云南楚雄地区签订了一项技术合作协议，根据协议，该院和楚雄地区的姚安铅矿签订了一项为期二十年的长期全面技术合作合同。这是昆明工学院双反运动以后，在勤工俭学方面采取的重大措施。该院自实行勤工俭学以来，以各种方式与地方工业实行合作，曾先后派出大批技术力量支援各专、县工业建设。
    根据协定，昆明工学院将集中科学技术力量，大力支援楚雄地区工矿企业迅速发展，大批教师和学生到姚安铅矿分别担任工程师、技术员和技术工人，负责建立各级技术机构；参加制定生产规划和完成年度生产任务的计划；负责技术指导；协助建立化验室、机修厂及试验所；为矿山培养训练科学技术干部和工人；接受矿山委托机械设备的加工订货等。楚雄地区厂矿和姚安铅矿将负责解决师生所在厂矿进行教学和科学研究的条件。
    合同签订以后，全院师生员工都表示热烈拥护，姚安铅矿对学校到矿山也表示热烈欢迎，双方提出了亲切的口号：长期合作，全面合作，学校的矿山，矿山的学校。
    目前，昆明工学院已经派出教师六十人，由党委副书记赵建中率领分批出发到矿山去。　（关学禹）
