Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, May 19th: The Bulgarian "Workers' Cause" newspaper published on the 18th the speech of Yugov, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, at the summary work and re-election meeting of the Plovdiv City Party organization on the 15th. In this speech, Yugov criticized the program adopted by the Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Yugov said that the Yugoslav program is full of obvious and systematic revisionist views. This program runs through a line from beginning to end, that is, an attempt to revise Marxism-Leninism, the proletarian revolution, and the basic principles of the transition from capitalism to socialism. If a brief comment needs to be made on the Yugoslav program, then it can be said that it is a collection of modern revisionism in the international workers' movement and the communist movement.

Yugov pointed out that just as all progressive mankind is rejoicing for the great victories achieved by the Soviet Union in communist construction and science and technology, and just as the launching of the Soviet artificial earth satellite makes people all over the world feel real joy and rejoicing, the Yugoslav leaders ungratefully slander the Soviet Union, that is, the pillar in the struggle of all mankind for peace and socialism.

He said, can this be compatible with our Marxist-Leninist principles and our communist morality? No, it is not compatible. We Bulgarian Communists resolutely fight back against this slander. We firmly believe and clearly realize that we are not only defending our loyal friend and ally, the Soviet Union, but also defending our world view and beliefs, that is, defending the essence of our entire conscious communist life.

Yugov said that we personally experience that without the Soviet Union's comprehensive, fraternal, and selfless assistance, and without the close cooperation between socialist countries under the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism, socialism cannot be built under the current circumstances, socialist industrialization cannot be realized, and the socialist transformation of agriculture and the socialist cultural revolution cannot be carried out.

Yugov said, isn't it clear that the path taken by the Yugoslav leaders, who deny this generally accepted truth, cannot guide Yugoslavia to achieve socialist victory in the economy? Isn't the truth not yet confirmed that cooperation with the irreconcilable enemies of socialism—the imperialists and the international capitalist reactionaries—cannot build socialism?

Yugov went on to say that our party does not hope to deepen the differences with the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on ideological issues. However, we must never abandon Marxist-Leninist principles. Future cooperation between us will largely depend on the Yugoslav leaders.

Yugov pointed out that the Bulgarian Communist Party, which has a rich revolutionary internationalist tradition, has waged an uncompromising struggle against all kinds of opportunists and revisionists since its establishment, and it unconditionally supports the two declarations issued by the Communist and Workers' Parties in Moscow. Our party fully condemns all new attempts to revise Marxism-Leninism, no matter where they come from. Our party is unswervingly fighting for the unity of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries and for proletarian internationalism.

    于哥夫在普罗夫迪夫市党组织大会上说
    南共纲领集现代修正主义大成
    不能引导南斯拉夫在经济上取得社会主义的胜利
    新华社索非亚19日电　保加利亚“工人事业报”18日刊登了保共中央政治局委员、部长会议主席于哥夫在普罗夫迪夫市党组织15日举行的总结工作和改选大会上的讲话。于哥夫在这次讲话中批评了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会所通过的纲领。
    于哥夫说，南共的纲领充满了明显的、系统的修正主义观点。这个纲领从头到尾贯穿着这样一种路线，即企图修正马克思列宁主义、无产阶级革命以及从资本主义向社会主义过渡的基本原则。如果需要对南共的纲领作出一个简要的评语，那末可以说，它是集国际工人运动和共产主义运动中的现代修正主义的大成。
    于哥夫指出，正当全体进步人类为苏联在共产主义建设和科学技术方面所取得的巨大胜利而欢欣鼓舞的时候，正当苏联的人造地球卫星的发射使世界各国人民都感到真正的喜悦和欢欣的时候，南斯拉夫的领导人却忘恩负义地污蔑苏联，即污蔑全人类争取和平和社会主义的斗争中的支柱。
    他说，这难道能同我们的马克思列宁主义原则、能同我们的共产主义道德相容吗？不，这是不能相容的。我们保加利亚共产党人坚决反击这种污蔑，我们深信并且清楚地意识到，我们这样做不仅是在保卫我们的忠实朋友和盟国——苏联，而且是在捍卫我们的世界观和信念，也就是说在捍卫我们全部自觉的共产主义生活的本质。
    于哥夫说，我们亲身体会到，没有苏联全面的、兄弟般的、大公无私的援助，没有社会主义各国之间在马克思列宁主义战无不胜的旗帜下的亲密无间的相互合作，在当前的情况下就不能建成社会主义，就不能实现社会主义工业化，就不能进行农业的社会主义改造和社会主义文化革命。
    于哥夫说，南斯拉夫的领导人否认这个为大家所公认的真理，他们所走的道路并不能引导南斯拉夫在经济上取得社会主义的胜利，这难道还不清楚吗？同社会主义的不共戴天的敌人——帝国主义者和国际资本主义反动派合作并不能建设社会主义，难道这个真理还没有得到证实吗？
    于哥夫接着说，我们党并不希望在意识形态问题上加深同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的分歧。但是，我们决不能背弃马克思列宁主义原则。今后我们之间的合作，在很大程度上取决于南斯拉夫的领导人。
    于哥夫指出，有着丰富的革命的国际主义传统的保加利亚共产党，自从成立以来就同形形色色的机会主义者和修正主义者进行不妥协的斗争，它无条件地支持各国共产党和工人党在莫斯科发表的两项宣言。我们党全力谴责一切修正马克思列宁主义的新企图，不管它们来自何方。我们党坚定不移地为各国共产党和工人党的团结、为无产阶级的国际主义而斗争。
