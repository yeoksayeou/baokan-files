Editorial Notes:

    The machine industry bears a glorious and arduous task in the great technological revolution. Any economic sector that implements technological transformation cannot do without the support of the machine industry.

    Can the machine industry achieve a great leap forward, advance at the fastest speed, and strive to catch up with all economic sectors, providing more and better machines for the great leap forward in industry and agriculture?

    The answer is affirmative. The news of the high-speed leap forward of the Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory and the Shanghai Agricultural Machinery Factory published today once again proves this affirmative answer. The Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Factory and other machine industries have broken superstitions and scorned old rules and regulations. As long as it complies with the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results, they dare to use methods that others dare not use; they dare to do things that others have not done. Thus, they are able to leap forward at an unprecedented speed. In this way, the machine industry will surely be able to catch up and move to the forefront.

    机械工业要努力赶到最前面去
    机械工业在实现伟大的技术革命中，担负着光荣和繁重的任务。任何经济部门实行技术改造，都离不开机械工业的支援。
    机械工业能不能大跃进，以最快的速度前进，争取赶到一切经济部门的最前面去，提供工农业大跃进以更多更好的机器呢？
    回答是肯定的。今天发表的武汉重型机床厂和上海农业机械厂高速度跃进的新闻再一次证明这一肯定的回答。武汉重型机床厂等机械工业破除迷信，藐视陈规旧律，只要是符合多快好省的原则，别人不敢用的办法，他们敢用；别人没做过的事情，他们敢做。于是，他们也就能够以前所未有的速度跃进。这样，机械工业也就一定能够赶到最前面去。
