The Zhuang Culture's Great Leap Forward Begins
Guangxi Zhuang Areas to See a Mass Literacy Campaign in Zhuang Language

(Our report) According to the Guangxi Daily, the Zhuang language literacy campaign in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is advancing with the force of a whirlwind and torrential rain in a Great Leap Forward.

Recently, the Yongning, Yishan, Baise and other regions in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have successively held Zhuang language literacy meetings, and formulated Zhuang language literacy leap forward plans. In the Zhuang populated areas within the autonomous region, a Zhuang language literacy movement of universal teaching and universal learning is about to emerge.

The Xiali Township of Luocheng and the Nongdong Agricultural Cooperative of Fusui in this autonomous region have already launched a nationwide Zhuang language learning movement. All young and middle-aged people are participating in the learning, and the elderly and children are also enthusiastically learning the Zhuang language. In Chengkong Village in Xiali Township, all 45 households lock their doors at night and run to the village half a mile away to study. In these places, in the past, "only the sounds of cattle and sheep were heard, not the sounds of reading." Now, "classes are opened in every village, and the sound of reading is everywhere."

Before launching the nationwide Zhuang language literacy campaign, some places mobilized the masses to conduct great debates. The Xiali Township Party Committee in Luocheng mobilized the masses to launch a great debate on learning culture, and also combined it with recounting the bitterness of illiteracy. Lu Zhibang, a member of the Changchun Agricultural Cooperative, said, "Before liberation, I only knew that white was paper and black was ink. Chairman Mao led us to turn over and helped us create the Zhuang language. Chairman Mao is even closer than my own mother. How can I be worthy of Chairman Mao if I don't learn the Zhuang language!" Through debate, cadres and the masses further recognized the importance of learning culture. They said that if the cultural revolution cannot keep up, the technological revolution will be hindered, which will affect the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. Some members of the Lisheng Agricultural Cooperative said, "To achieve a yield of 1,400 catties per mu, we need technology; tractors, 'shasha' sound, cannot be driven without culture. To achieve agricultural mechanization, cultural technology cannot be lacking." This township also introduced the experience of learning the Zhuang language through the personal experiences of typical figures, solving the masses' fear of difficulties. They wrote Zhuang characters on walls, tree trunks, stones, agricultural tools, and furniture, and erected literacy signs at intersections and fields, creating a strong atmosphere of learning.

Currently, there are three million illiterate Zhuang young and middle-aged people in the entire autonomous region, and about 30,000 Zhuang language literacy teachers. At present, various places are actively cultivating and training a group of literacy teachers. In addition to training old students to be teachers, they also advocate old students teaching new students, and those who know first teach those who know later, in the daily study, implementing the mass line of relying on the masses and teaching by the people.

Various localities also closely integrate production with Zhuang language literacy, combining production and learning organizations into one. The production team is the learning class, the team leader serves as the class teacher, the team cadres serve as the class cadres, and the team members are students. Xiali Township implements "three unifications" (unified planning, unified center, unified strength), "four guarantees" (guarantee time, guarantee tasks, guarantee quality, guarantee mobilizing the masses), and "two managements" (manage central work, manage cultural and educational work) from top to bottom, managing both production and learning.

### 僮族文化大翻身开始了  广西僮族聚居地区将出现僮文扫盲高潮

　　僮族文化大翻身开始了
    广西僮族聚居地区将出现僮文扫盲高潮
    本报讯　据广西日报报道：广西僮族自治区的僮文扫盲工作正以疾风骤雨之势在大跃进着。
    最近，广西僮族自治区的邕宁、宜山、百色等专区，先后开了僮文扫盲会议，制订了僮文扫盲跃进计划。在自治区内的僮族聚居地区，即将出现一个万民教、万民学的僮文扫盲运动。
    这个自治区的罗城下里乡和扶绥弄洞农业社，已开展了全民性的僮文学习运动，全部青壮年都参加学习，老人少年也踊跃学习僮文。下里乡成孔屯四十五户人家，晚上都锁上门跑到半里外的屯上去学习。在这些地方，过去“只闻牛羊叫，不闻读书声”，现在，“屯屯开了班，遍地读书声”。
    在开展全民性的僮文扫盲运动前，有些地方发动群众进行大辩论。罗城下里乡党委发动群众开展了学习文化的大辩论，还结合诉文盲苦。长春农业社社员卢治邦说：“解放前我只知道白是纸，黑是墨。毛主席领导我们翻了身，又帮助我们创造僮文。毛主席呀，比亲娘还亲。不学僮文怎对得起毛主席呢！”经过辩论，干部群众进一步认识了学习文化的重要意义。他们说，文化革命跟不上，技术革命就会受到阻碍，也就影响农业生产的不断跃进。里胜农业社有的社员说：“要搞亩产一千四百斤，没有技术就不行；拖拉机，沙沙叫，没有文化开不了，要搞农业机械化，文化技术不能差。”这个乡还通过典型人物的现身说法，介绍学习僮文的经验，解决群众怕困难的思想。他们在墙上、树干、石头、农具、家具上都写上僮文字，路口、田边插上识字牌，造成浓厚的学习气氛。
    现在，全自治区有僮族青壮年文盲三百万人，僮文扫盲教师约三万人。目前，各地正在积极培养训练一批扫盲教师，除了培养旧学员当教师外，在日常的学习中，还提倡老学员教新学员，先知教后知，贯彻依靠群众，以民教民的群众路线。
    各地在僮文扫盲时还密切结合生产，把生产和学习的组织结合为一，生产队就是学习班，队长担任班主任，队干部当班干部，队员是学员。下里乡从上到下贯彻“三统”（统一计划，统一中心，统一力量），“四包”（包时间，包任务，包质量，包发动群众），“两管”（管中心工作，管文教工作）生产学习双管齐下。
