　　Sunday Diary
　　Wang Chong
    Not long after breakfast, Comrade Chen from Peking University came to talk. My wife brought out a plate of sweets and peanuts to entertain the guest. The three children were drawn over like iron filings to a magnet. Qin'er grabbed a handful, stuffed them into her pocket, and was about to reach for the peanuts again. Xiang'er climbed onto my lap, crying and shouting, "Candy! Candy!". Hong'er, who was playing outside, also rushed over, tripping on the threshold and falling. But she didn't care about that, she got up and charged towards the table.
    My wife repeatedly said loudly, "Don't eat too much, let uncle eat!" They wouldn't listen. In the past, my wife and I always felt embarrassed to insist too much when there were guests around. The children slowly developed this bad habit. Guests became their protectors.
    In the future, we must pay special attention: even if there are guests, we should adhere to correct family education. Guests should not become a bomb shelter for children's willfulness.
    At noon, there was no salt left when cooking. I specifically asked Hong'er and Qin'er to go to the small vegetable shop at the entrance to buy some. They both agreed happily. The older one took the money and led her younger sibling out the door. I followed far behind, observing their actions. The younger one stopped at the doorway; the older one went into the vegetable shop, where five or six people were crowded in front of the counter. Seeing so many people, and the salesperson was too busy to deal with them, the child didn't know what to do. The child returned empty-handed. When they met me, the younger one lowered his head, not saying a word. The older one only said softly, "Too many people..."
    Crowded places are difficult for children to deal with. I took the child's hand again and led them into the vegetable shop, teaching the child to say, "Comrade, buy a packet of salt!" When the item was in hand, the child was very happy, holding up the packet of salt high, like a soldier who had won a battle, holding up the spoils of war.
    Children's independent work ability cannot "spontaneously" emerge. Adults should provide timely and appropriate help. "Help" is the crutch for cultivating children's independent work.
    In the afternoon, I took the children to Zhongshan Park to play. They hadn't seen the green grass for a long time. As soon as we entered the park, a patch of fresh green. The children were so happy that they jumped up and down. Seeing the rockery, they ran up and down it, as lively as a group of little squirrels.
    The children were running and jumping, their foreheads covered in sweat. They were all thirsty. I took them to the tea stall. I deliberately gave Hong'er two fen to buy tea. "Okay, I'll go!" He walked to the tea stall, stood there, hesitated for a moment, and then ran back, shyly whispering to me, "Dad, what do I say?". I suddenly remembered that I hadn't explained it clearly. So I told him again, "You give him the money and say, 'Buy a cup of tea, please!'". He walked away with confidence. "Buy a cup of tea, please!" The voice was very loud, and Qin'er and I both laughed.
    When letting children do work they have never done before, you should explain the various ways to do it beforehand. What adults consider insignificant work is a daunting task for children. Adults should always consider problems from the perspective of the child, understand the child's difficulties, and appropriately suggest solutions and ways to overcome the difficulties.

　　星期天的日记
　　王重
    早饭后不久，北大陈同志来谈。妻子拿了一盘糖果和花生招待客人。三个孩子像铁粉遇到磁铁一般被吸引过来了。琴儿抓了一把，塞到口袋里，又准备伸手拿花生。香儿爬在我膝上，带哭带嚷地叫：“糖！糖！”。门外玩的红儿也争先恐后地赶来，在门槛上碰了一下，摔倒了。但也顾不得这些了，爬起来就向桌边冲来。
    妻子再三大声说：“不要吃得太多了，让叔叔吃！”他们那里肯听。妻子和我过去一向认为有客人在身边，不好意思过分坚持。孩子就慢慢养成这种坏习惯。客人来了成了他们的保护人。
    今后要特别注意：纵使有客人来也应该坚持正确的家庭教育。客人不应成为孩子任性的防空洞。
    中午煮菜时没有盐了。特地叫红儿和琴儿到门口小菜铺去买。他们都兴高采烈地答应了。大的拿着钱，牵着弟弟一同跑出门去了。我远远地跟在后面，观察他们的行动。小的走到门口便止步了；大的走进菜铺，柜台前围着五六个人。孩子看见人多，售货员也忙得不可开交，不知道该怎么办。孩子空手回来了。遇见了我，小的低着头，不声不响。大的只轻轻地说：“人太多……。”
    人多，是孩子们难以对付的场合。我又牵着孩子的手，带他们进菜铺里，教孩子说：“同志，买一包盐！”东西到手了，孩子高兴得很，高高举起那包盐，像打了胜仗的兵士高高举起战利品一样。
    孩子们的独立工作能力不能让他们“自发”产生。大人应及时的适当帮忙。“帮助”是培养儿童独立工作的拐棍。
    下午带着孩子到中山公园去玩。他们很久没有看见青草地。一进公园，一片新绿。孩子喜欢得蹦跳起来。看见那假山，也跑上去，爬上爬下，像一群小松鼠一样活泼。
    孩子跑跑跳跳，额上尽是汗了。口都渴了。带他们到卖茶水处。我故意拿了二分钱给红儿让他去买茶。“好吧，我去吧！”他走到卖茶处，站在那儿，迟疑了片刻，又飞跑过来，羞答答地对我细声说：“爸爸，怎么说呢？”我猛然想起了，刚才没有说清楚。于是又给他说：“你把钱交给他，说：买一杯茶吧！”他充满信心地走去了。“买一杯茶吧！”声音响得很，我和琴儿都笑起来了。
    要让孩子做从未做过的工作，事先应该讲清各种做法。大人们认为微不足道的工作，在孩子看来却是一件艰巨的任务。大人应该处处从孩子的情况出发考虑问题，了解孩子的困难，并且适当地提示解决和克服困难的办法。
