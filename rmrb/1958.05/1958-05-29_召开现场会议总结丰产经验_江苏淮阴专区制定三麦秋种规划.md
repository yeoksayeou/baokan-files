Convene On-Site Meeting to Summarize Rich Harvest Experiences
Huaiyin Special District, Jiangsu Province, Formulates Three-Wheat Autumn Planting Plan

(Our newspaper dispatch) The Huaiyin Special District of Jiangsu Province recently convened a meeting of county party secretaries to comprehensively summarize the rich harvest experiences of this year's three wheat crops (namely barley, wheat, and buckwheat), and put forward a plan for next year's autumn planting.

The Huaiyin Special District is a low-yield area. Historically, the yield per unit area of summer crops has rarely exceeded one hundred catties. This year, more than eight million mu of summer crops have achieved a bumper harvest. It is estimated that the average yield of the three wheat crops is more than 130 catties, an increase of about 40% over last year, and many high-yield models have emerged.

The meeting was held at the Cangji Agricultural Cooperative in Siyang County, where alkali land has achieved a bumper harvest. After visiting the cooperative's wheat fields, the comrades attending the meeting also visited the Huaiyin District Agricultural Technology Center Guidance Station and the Tongzui Cooperative and Fanzhuang Cooperative in Wanyou Township, Huai'an County. Through on-site visits and linking them to their local actual conditions, the meeting comprehensively summarized the rich harvest experiences of this year's three wheat crops. In particular, the Cangji Cooperative seized the main yield-increasing measures of good seeds, close planting, sufficient fertilizer application, and good plowing and harrowing this year, and gained the experience of achieving an average yield of 400 to 500 catties per mu, which opened the door to high yield of three wheat crops for everyone.

Liu Shunyuan, Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave important instructions at the meeting. He said: "When summarizing production experience, it is necessary to affirm achievements. But we must not be satisfied with these achievements. We should also find out the shortcomings and lessons, so that production can continue to move forward." He also said, "Learning from the advanced can only get 60 points, catching up with the advanced and surpassing the advanced can get 100 points. Our slogan is to learn with humility and be determined to catch up." Therefore, the representatives strictly examined the shortcomings in production. Dai Yucai, director of the Cangji Cooperative, said: "Although the Cangji Cooperative has a bumper harvest, it is not without shortcomings. For example, the close planting is not balanced, the fertilizer is still insufficient, and good seeds are not used 100%. If these shortcomings are corrected, the yield per mu can reach 800 catties, of which wheat can reach 1,000 catties per mu."

In addition to proposing to increase production next year, the meeting also formulated a specific plan and decided to use good seeds on 70% of the wheat fields this year. In order to achieve close planting, the meeting promoted the close-planting improved drill seeder of Shuyang County, so that the row spacing was reduced from more than eight inches to about four inches, thus increasing the land utilization rate by 68%. The meeting decided to expand the green manure area to 3.5 million mu and launch a summer fertilizer accumulation campaign.

Finally, the meeting decided to immediately hold on-site meetings in counties, townships, and cooperatives to summarize experiences and formulate autumn planting plans.

    召开现场会议总结丰产经验
    江苏淮阴专区制定三麦秋种规划
    本报讯　江苏省淮阴专区最近召开县委书记会议，全面总结了今年三麦（即大麦、小麦、元麦）丰产经验，提出了明年秋种规划。
    淮阴专区是个低产地区，历史上夏熟作物的单位面积产量很少超过一百斤。今年八百多万亩夏熟作物获得大丰收。估计三麦单产平均一百三十多斤，比去年增产四成左右，并出现了许多高额丰产典型。
    会议是在碱地获得大丰收的泗阳县仓集农业社举行的。到会同志参观了该社的麦田后，又参观了淮阴区农业技术中心指导站和淮安县万友乡童嘴社、平桥乡范庄社。通过现场参观和联系本地实际情况，全面总结了今年的三麦丰产经验。特别是仓集社今年抓住了良种、密植、施肥足、耕耙好等主要增产措施，获得平均亩产四百斤到五百斤高额丰产的经验，像一把钥匙，给大家打开了通向三麦高产的大门。
    中共江苏省委书记刘顺元同志在会上作了重要指示。他说：“在总结生产经验的时候，肯定成绩是必要的。但不能满足这些成绩，应该同时找出缺点和教训，才能推动生产不断前进。”他又说，“学习先进只能得六十分，赶上先进、超过先进才能得一百分。我们的口号是虚心学习，决心赶上。”于是代表们严格地检查了生产中的缺点。仓集社主任戴玉才说：“仓集社虽然丰收，但不是没有缺点的。如密植不平衡，肥料还不足，没有百分之百的使用良种。如果改正了这些缺点，就能亩产八百斤，其中小麦可以亩产一千斤。”
    会议除提出明年增产外，又制定了具体规划，并决定今年用70％的麦田面积使用良种。为了达到密植，会议推广了沭阳县密植改良耩，使行距从八寸多缩小到四寸左右，这样，就使土地利用率提高了68％。会议决定，把绿肥面积扩大到三百五十万亩。并开展一个夏季积肥突击运动。
    会议最后决定，马上分县、乡、社召开现场会议，总结经验，制定秋播规划。
