　　General Political Department Directs the Whole Army to Launch the Five-Good Movement
    Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: The General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently instructed all units of the army to launch the "Five-Good" movement in companies.
    The instruction stated that, after the rectification campaign and the Two-Anti movement, the troops' socialist consciousness has been greatly enhanced, and the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of officers and soldiers is very high. Comparing efforts and competing to be advanced has become a common phenomenon. In order to guide the enthusiasm and energy of the masses in the correct direction, and to consolidate and sustain it, after the company's Two-Anti movement comes to an end, the "Five-Good" (1. Study hard; 2. Cherish weapons, equipment, and all public property; 3. Eliminate accidents; 4. Economize production; 5. Exercise) proposed by the army representatives attending the Third National Congress of the Youth League should be taken as the goal to launch a relatively lasting mass movement among soldiers.

　　总政治部指示全军开展五好运动
    据新华社14日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部最近指示全军各部队在连队中开展“五好”运动。
    指示中说，经过整风和双反运动，部队的社会主义觉悟大大提高，广大官兵的革命热情非常高涨，比干劲、比先进已是普遍现象。为了把群众的这种热情和干劲引导到正确方向，并使它巩固持续下去，在连队双反运动告一段落后，应把出席全国青年第三次代表大会的军队代表所提出的“五好”（一、努力学习；二、爱护武器装备和一切公物；三、消灭事故；四、节约生产；五、锻炼身体）作为目标，在士兵中开展一个比较持久的群众运动。
