Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 12th dispatch by TASS: The Kalinin factory in Moscow is manufacturing a batch of plastic boats. These boats are made of materials such as polyether resin and fiberglass, making them lightweight, sturdy, and capable of saving a large amount of metal.

According to statistics, only 250 tons of polyether resin and 170 tons of fiberglass are needed to build 1,100 lifeboats, 190 electric boats, and 115 internal combustion cargo ships with a carrying capacity of 10 to 15 tons.

The surface of the plastic boat is very smooth, and its draft is smaller than that of ordinary boats. The resistance of the water to the hull is also small. Therefore, its speed greatly exceeds that of metal and wooden boats. If a special lightweight material is filled in the space between the outer and inner shells of the boat, the ship can obtain very large buoyancy, and even if the boat is filled with water, it will not sink.

The strength of the plastic used to build the boats is by no means lower than that of the best steel, but its weight is almost four-fifths lighter than steel. Plastics are not affected by air or climate, and their performance will not change in temperatures ranging from minus 70 degrees Celsius to 200 degrees Celsius. This plastic is not affected by the chemical action of gasoline, kerosene, petroleum, lubricating oil, and salt solutions, and it will not corrode.

Moscow engineers will also begin designing larger plastic boats, including internal combustion cargo ships and tankers with a carrying capacity of less than 100 tons, tugboats with a power of 150 horsepower, and passenger boats capable of carrying 100 people.

### 轻快结实  节省金属  苏联制造塑料小船

　　轻快结实  节省金属
    苏联制造塑料小船
    新华社12日讯  据塔斯社莫斯科讯：莫斯科的加里宁工厂正在制造一批塑料小船。这些小船用聚醚树脂和玻璃纤维等原料制成，轻快结实，可以节约大量金属。
    据统计，只要有二百五十吨聚醚树脂和一百七十吨玻璃纤维就能建造一千一百只救生艇、一百九十只电动船和一百一十五只载重量十到十五吨的内燃机货船。
    塑料船的表面十分光滑，吃水也比普通船小，水对船壳的阻力也小，因此，它的速度大大超过金属船和木船。如果在船的外壳和内壳之间的空间填上一种特制的轻型材料，船舶就能获得非常大的浮力，甚至船里灌满水，也不会下沉。
    用来造船的塑料的强度决不低于最好的钢，而重量却几乎比钢轻五分之四。塑料不受空气和气候的影响，在零下七十度的低温到零上二百度高温的条件下，它的性能也不会改变。这种塑料不受汽油、煤油、石油、滑油和盐溶液化学作用的影响，更不会腐蚀。
    莫斯科的工程师们还将开始设计一些较大型的塑料船，其中有载重量一百吨以内的内燃机货船和油船、功率达一百五十马力的拖船和可供一百人乘坐的客艇。
