    Below Qingcheng Mountain
    (Four Poems)
    Ge Bi Zhou
    Clear Water River
    The Clear Water Ditch of sixty years ago,
    Was washed away by a great flood!
    The Clear Water River has overflowed for sixty years,
    We want to turn it into water-rich fields.
    Qingcheng Mountain wears a silver helmet,
    An land reclamation shock brigade has arrived.
    Below Qingcheng Mountain, white frost is falling,
    Eighty-six-year-old Shang Hongshun insists on reclaiming land.
    Voices roar on the upper and lower reaches of the river,
    The Clear Water River is turning back into a Clear Water Ditch.
    Qingming (Tomb Sweeping Day)
    In previous years, during Qingming, we sowed millet,
    This year, during Qingming, we rush to transplant rice seedlings;
    In previous years, transplanting rice seedlings depended on men,
    This year, women also go down to the paddy fields;
    In previous years, millet yields were only a few hundred jin per mu,
    This year, we aim for two thousand jin!
    Old Man Zhao tore up the old almanac,
    He is very proactive in densely planting seedlings.
    Competition Stage
    A competition stage is set up at the crossroads,
    Those with skills should show them off:
    Flying airplanes, driving trains,
    Even if you can't ride in a car,
    You should at least ride a bicycle,
    Millions of people are vying for rockets,
    Who wants to push a wheelbarrow!
    Compete with your skills on the production battlefield,
    Heroes follow man-made satellites!
    Bugle Call
    The red flag rolls up the morning star,
    The sound of foreign bugles floats over the fields,
    Whistles sound in every forest courtyard,
    The sweet dreams of the birds are startled,
    Streams and roads filled with the sounds of birds, people, hoes, and oxen.

    青城山下
    （四首）
    戈壁舟
    清水河
    六十年前的清水沟，
    一场大水给冲走！
    清水河泛滥了六十年，
    我们要它变成饱水田。
    青城山头戴银盔，
    开来了开荒突击队。
    青城山下在打白头霜，
    八十六岁的尚洪顺硬要来开荒。
    上河下河人声吼，
    清水河又变成清水沟。
    清明
    往年的清明撒谷子，
    今年的清明赶栽秧；
    往年栽秧靠男子汉，
    今年妇女也下秧田；
    往年谷子亩产几百斤，
    今年要打两千斤！
    赵老汉撕掉旧皇历，
    密栽秧子好积极。
    评比台
    十字路口摆擂台，
    有本事的都拿出来：
    驾飞机，开火车，
    坐不上汽车，
    也要骑部自行车，
    千百万人抢火箭，
    谁愿去推鸡公车！
    生产战场上比身手，
    英雄跟着人造卫星走！
    号声
    红旗卷起启明星，
    田野上飘着洋号声，
    个个林盘里哨子响，
    鸟儿的甜梦被惊醒，
    条条小溪条条的路鸟声、人声，锄影、牛影。
