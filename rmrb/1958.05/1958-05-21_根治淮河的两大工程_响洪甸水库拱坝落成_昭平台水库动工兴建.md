    Two Major Projects to Harness the Huai River
    Xianghongdian Reservoir Arch Dam Completed, Zhaopingtai Reservoir Construction Begins
    Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 20th: China's first concrete gravity arch dam – the Xianghongdian Reservoir gravity arch dam – was recently completed.
    This dam is located on the west source of the Pi River, a tributary of the Huai River. The arc length of the dam crest is 357.5 meters, and the net height of the dam body is 83.5 meters. It can store 2.342 billion cubic meters of water, reducing the peak flood flow from 13,320 cubic meters per second to 2,400 cubic meters per second. Together with the Foziling, Meishan, Mozitan, and Lianghekou (to be built) reservoirs, it forms a reservoir complex, which can not only solve the Pi River flood problem but also alleviate the threat of flooding on the main stream of the Huai River.
    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 19th: The Zhaopingtai Reservoir on the upper reaches of the Sha River, a tributary of the Huai River, recently commenced construction. This is one of the ten major reservoirs on the Huai River. Currently, the water diversion tunnel and spillway are being excavated. Dam construction will begin in September, and the dam must be built to the point where it can block floods before the next flood season. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of next year.
    The Zhaopingtai Reservoir is located in the canyon where the Sha River and its tributary, the Dangze River, converge in Lushan County, Henan Province. The planned height of the earth dam is 34.5 meters, with a length of approximately 2,300 meters, and the reservoir can hold 680 million cubic meters of water. After the reservoir is completed, it can reduce the peak flood flow of 8,500 cubic meters per second, which occurs once a century in the upper reaches of the Sha River, to 700 cubic meters per second. Combined with the Nihewa flood storage project downstream of Zhaopingtai, the peak flood flow of the Sha River, which occurs once every 50 years, can be reduced to below 2,000 cubic meters per second in Luohe Town. In this way, the safety of the Pingdingshan mining area, Luohe Town, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, Zhoukou Town, and the areas along the river within the Sha River basin can be guaranteed, and 200,000 mu of farmland on the main stream of the Sha River will be protected from floods and waterlogging. At the same time, it will create favorable conditions for the discharge of internal waterlogging from the Li River, Tang River, and other tributaries of the Sha River, as well as the tributaries of the Ying River.

### 根治淮河的两大工程  响洪甸水库拱坝落成  昭平台水库动工兴建

    根治淮河的两大工程
    响洪甸水库拱坝落成  昭平台水库动工兴建
    据新华社合肥20日电　我国第一座混凝土重力拱坝——响洪甸水库重力拱坝在最近建成。
    这座坝位于淮河支流淠河西源上，坝顶弧长三百五十七点五公尺，坝身净高八十三点五公尺，能蓄水二十三亿四千二百万公方，可以把一万三千三百二十秒公方的洪峰减到二千四百秒公方。它同佛子岭、梅山、磨子潭、两河口（待兴建）等水库组成一个水库群，不仅可以解决淠河洪水问题，而且可以减轻淮河干流洪水威胁。
    据新华社郑州19日电　淮河支流沙河上游的昭平台水库在最近开工。这是淮河十大水库中的一座。现在正在开挖输水隧洞和溢洪道，9月将进入建筑大坝，明年汛前大坝要建筑到能起拦洪作用。预计明年年底可以完成全部工程。
    昭平台水库在河南省鲁山县沙河和它的支流荡泽河汇流后的峡谷处。拦河土坝计划高三十四点五公尺，长约二千三百公尺，水库可容水六点八亿公方。这座水库建成后，可以把沙河上游百年一遇的八千五百秒公方的洪峰削弱到七百秒公方；再结合昭平台以下的泥河洼蓄洪工程，可把沙河五十年一遇的洪峰在漯河镇压低到二千秒公方以下。这样，就可保障沙河流域内的平顶山矿区、漯河镇、京广铁路、周口镇及沿河地区的安全，使沙河干流二十万亩农田免受洪涝灾害；同时，也为澧河、唐河等沙河支流及颍河支流排泄内涝创造有利条件。
