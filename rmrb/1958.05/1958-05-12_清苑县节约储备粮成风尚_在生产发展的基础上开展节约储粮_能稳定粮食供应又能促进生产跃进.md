Qingyuan County Develops a Fashion for Thrift and Grain Storage.
　　Developing Thrift and Grain Storage on the Basis of Production Development Can Stabilize Grain Supply and Promote Production Leap Forward.

　　This newspaper reports that Qingyuan County, Hebei Province, launched a movement of "Everyone participates in the Great Leap Forward in Production, every household stores glorious grain." A new situation has emerged in the county's grain work, eliminating the influence of capitalist ideology existing among some farmers, and transforming from years of shouting about grain shortages to having surplus grain reserves, providing an important guarantee for the Great Leap Forward in production.

　　Although Qingyuan County has suffered many natural disasters since liberation, grain production has gradually increased under the leadership of the Party and the government. Since the implementation of unified purchase and sale of grain, the state has also transferred a lot of grain from other places for supply, and the grain situation in the county has been basically normal. However, since the beginning of spring this year, many farmers have started shouting about grain shortages again as in previous years, which has brought some negative impact on the Great Leap Forward in production. After analyzing this situation, the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China believed that although some practical problems needed to be solved, the main problem was that some farmers had capitalist ideas, which was a struggle between two roads in grain work. At the same time, some farmers had surplus grain at home, but they had many ideological concerns and dared not "reveal their wealth." There was an unhealthy trend in rural areas that having surplus grain did not seem glorious. It is necessary to solve the ideological problems of farmers and establish a glorious atmosphere of thrift and grain storage in order to achieve a stable situation in grain work. Therefore, it was decided to launch a mass movement of "Everyone participates in the Great Leap Forward in Production, every household stores glorious grain" on the basis of rural women's "diligence and thrift in managing the household, and saving grain." First, the method of grasping both ends to lead the middle was adopted, and Liangzhai Township and Da Li Gezhuang Township, which already had a preliminary foundation for thrift and grain storage, and Hu Zihui Village, which was more seriously affected by grain shortages, were selected for typical experiments. After mobilizing the masses in Liangzhai Township and Da Li Gezhuang Township, 88% of the households stored more than 610,000 jin of grain, with an average of 82 jin per household. Among them, the county party committee's "experimental field" - Wenren Village, basically achieved "everyone saves, every family has reserves." After the launch of the movement in Hu Zihui Village, which had 385 households, more than 70% of the households in the village stored grain, and the remaining households that were truly short of grain were also completely solved through the voluntary mutual borrowing of the masses. After gaining experience in these two different types of typical cases, the county party committee immediately organized more than 800 cadres from county agencies and villages and communes to visit and held an on-site meeting to promote it comprehensively. As of late April, within a short period of ten days, 60% of the households in the county had stored 2.59 million jin of grain, and the grain work immediately showed an unprecedented stable situation, achieving satisfaction for the state, the commune, and the members. Thrift and grain storage became a glorious social trend. Many families happily wrote the numbers and methods of their thrift and grain storage on colored paper and pasted them on their front doors. Many communes, teams, and households took out secretly stored grain and turned it into open grain. The unhealthy trend of shouting about grain shortages and wasting grain was criticized by social opinion, and the idea of taking pride in grain shortages and relying solely on state supply was also reversed.

　　According to the analysis of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China, carrying out the thrift and grain storage movement has many important meanings: First, it has found an important way to stabilize the grain situation in the long term. Since the masses' tense psychology on the grain issue has been relieved, and since the thrift and grain storage movement is carried out on the basis of production development, as long as the thrift and grain storage work is regularized, the problem of grain shortages will not occur again. Moreover, this will further promote the development of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. Second, after the leaders have clarified the surplus and shortage figures of the masses, they can place grain purchase and sale on a stable and reliable basis and take the initiative in grain work. Third, it has found a more specific, more in-depth, and more practical way to implement the policy of "running the commune diligently and thriftily, and managing the household diligently and thriftily." Fourth, politically, it has effectively cracked down on the speculative activities of grain profiteers and the rampant attacks of landlords, rich peasants, rightists, and other elements on the grain front.

　　The Qingyuan County Committee has initially gained some basic experience in leading this work, that is, the Party Committee Secretary is in charge, the whole party is mobilized, the whole people are mobilized, the policies are thoroughly implemented, the masses' concerns are dispelled, and the entire work process is regarded as an arduous ideological mobilization process. At the beginning, the masses had many concerns about thrift and grain storage, mainly four fears: First, fear of state purchase; second, fear of offsetting consumption quotas; third, fear of investing in the commune; fourth, fear of revealing wealth. In response to these concerns, the leaders clearly explained the policy to the masses: Thrift and storage is for yourself, the state does not want it, the commune does not want it, and it does not offset consumption quotas. If you voluntarily sell it to the state, the state welcomes it. Those stored in the state granary will be issued a thrift and grain storage turnover certificate, and you can buy it back whenever you need it; if commune members who are short of grain store grain, the state will still supply it according to the quota. If you voluntarily buy less or do not buy, the state also welcomes it; the use of commune members' stored grain is decided by themselves, and others shall not interfere, and so on. While implementing these policies, the masses were also publicized about the benefits of thrift and grain storage. The masses' ideological concerns are generally easily resolved.

　　Qingyuan County also adheres to the class line in its work, relying closely on the poor peasants. Through the method of recalling the past and comparing it with the present, the awareness of the masses has been effectively improved. The poor peasants have developed a habit of thrift in their past lives, and now they are more receptive to grain storage and have the best ways to save. For example, the poor peasants in Wenren Village are the most active in thrift and grain storage, and they store the most grain. Of the 69 activists who emerged in the village, 67 are poor peasants.

　　Qingyuan County has also universally and appropriately organized ideological debates and posted big-character posters, listing thrift and grain storage as a specific content of the current rural rectification campaign. In the debate in Wenren Village, the ideological obstacles that originally thought there was no grain to store were quickly eliminated by calculating detailed accounts and big accounts.

　　In addition, Qingyuan County also vigorously commends models of thrift and grain storage, posting honor rolls, wearing honor flowers, hanging honor plaques, issuing certificates of merit, awarding banners, etc., resulting in deeds of every household striving for glory and everyone striving to be a model, forming a glorious atmosphere of thrift and grain storage in the countryside.

　　The Qingyuan County Committee has initially planned to institutionalize the work of thrift and grain storage and adhere to it in the future. The party and government leaders of Hebei Province have decided to promote the experience of Qingyuan County throughout the province.

　　清苑县节约储备粮成风尚
　　在生产发展的基础上开展节约储粮
    能稳定粮食供应又能促进生产跃进
    本报讯　河北省清苑县开展“人人生产大跃进，户户储备光荣粮”的运动，全县在粮食工作上出现了一个新的局面，消除了一部分农民中存在的资本主义思想影响，从连年叫喊缺粮转变为有余粮储备，为生产大跃进提供了重要的保证。
    清苑县在解放以来虽然遭受多次自然灾害，但在党和政府的领导下，粮食产量仍是逐渐增长的。粮食统购统销以来，国家还从外地调来许多粮食供应，全县的粮食情况基本正常。但是今年入春以来，不少农民又像往年一样叫喊起缺粮来，给生产大跃进带来了一些消极影响。中共清苑县委员会分析了这一情况以后，认为虽然有些实际问题需要解决，但主要还是有些农民存在着资本主义思想，是粮食工作上两条道路的斗争问题。同时，有一部分农民家中虽有余粮，但有很多思想顾虑，不敢“露富”。农村中有一种余粮似乎不光荣的歪风。必须解决农民的思想问题，树立节约储粮光荣的风气，才能取得粮食工作的稳定局面。于是确定在全县农村妇女“勤俭持家、节约用粮”的基础上开展“人人生产大跃进，户户储备光荣粮”的群众性运动。首先采取了抓两头带中间的方法，选择节约储备粮食已有初步基础的良寨乡和大李各庄乡，以及缺粮闹得比较严重的胡指挥村进行典型试验。良寨乡和大李各庄乡经过发动群众以后，88％的农户共储存了六十一万多斤粮食，平均每户储粮八十二斤。其中县委的“试验田”——温仁村，基本上作到了“人人都节约，家家有储备”。三百八十五户的胡指挥村运动开展以后，全村有70％以上的农户储存了粮食，其余真正缺粮的农户，也经过发动群众自愿互借全部解决了问题。在这两方面情况不同的典型都取得经验以后，县委立即组织全县机关和乡村、社的干部八百多人参观前往，并召开了现场会议全面推广。截至4月下旬，在短短的十天时间内，全县已有60％的农户储备了粮食二百五十九万斤，粮食工作立即出现了空前稳定的局面，达到了国家、社和社员三满意。节约储备粮食成了光荣的社会风尚，许多人家喜气洋洋地把自己节约储备粮食的数字和方法，写在彩色纸上贴在大门口。许多社、队、农户纷纷将暗存的粮食拿出来变成了明粮。乱喊缺粮和浪费粮食受到社会舆论的指责，以缺粮为荣的歪风，单纯依赖国家供应的思想也扭转了。
    据中共清苑县委员会分析，开展节约储备粮食运动有多方面的重要意义：首先是找到了长期稳定粮食局面的重要办法。由于群众在粮食问题上的紧张心理解除了，由于节约储粮运动是在生产发展的基础上开展的，只要把节约储备粮食工作经常化，缺粮的问题就不会再发生。而且这样还进一步促进了农业生产大跃进的开展。其次是领导上弄清群众的余缺底数以后，就可将粮食购销放在稳定可靠的基础上，在粮食工作上取得主动。第三、为贯彻执行“勤俭办社、勤俭持家”的方针找到一个更加具体、更加深入、更加实际的办法。第四、在政治上有效地打击了粮食奸商的投机活动和地主、富农、右派分子等在粮食战线上的猖狂进攻。
    清苑县委在领导这一工作中初步得出了一些基本经验，这就是党委书记专管，全党动员，全民发动，深入贯彻政策，解除群众顾虑，把整个工作过程都作为艰巨的思想发动过程。开始时群众对节约储备粮食顾虑很多，主要有四怕：一怕国家收购；二怕抵顶消费指标；三怕社内搞投资；四怕露富。针对这些顾虑，领导上明确地向群众交代了政策：节约储备归自己，国家不要社不要，也不抵顶消费指标，如果自愿卖给国家，国家欢迎。储存在国家粮库的，发给节约储备粮食周转证，何时需用可以何时买回；缺粮社员储备了粮食，国家照常按指标供应，如果自愿少买或不买，国家也欢迎；社员的储备粮需要动用时由自己决定，其他人不得干涉等等。在储粮的方法上，采取群众自己储备、社储备、国家代社和社员储备等三种方法，采用哪一种完全由节约储粮者决定。贯彻这些政策的同时，还向群众宣传了节约储粮的好处。群众的思想顾虑一般都迎刃而解了。
      清苑县在工作中还坚持阶级路线，紧紧依靠贫农，通过回忆对比的方法，有效地提高了群众的觉悟，贫农在过去的生活中养成了节约习惯，现在对储备粮食容易接受，对节约也最有办法。如温仁村贫农在节约储备粮食中最积极，储粮也最多，全村涌现出的六十九名积极分子有六十七名是贫农。
    清苑县还普遍地适当地组织了思想辩论、出大字报，把节约储备粮食列为当前农村整风的一个具体内容。温仁村在辩论中，通过算细账，算大账，使原来认为无粮可储的思想障碍很快解除了。
    此外，清苑县还大张旗鼓地表扬节约储备粮食的模范，张贴光荣榜，戴光荣花，挂光荣匾，发奖状，奖旗等等，出现了户户争光荣、人人争模范的事迹，在农村中形成了节约储备粮食光荣的风气。
    清苑县委初步计划，今后要把节约储备粮食的工作形成制度坚持贯彻下去。河北省党政领导部门决定把清苑县的经验在全省推广。
