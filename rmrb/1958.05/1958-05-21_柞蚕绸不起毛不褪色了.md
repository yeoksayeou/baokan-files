    Tussah Silk No Longer Pills or Fades
    (Our dispatch) Engineers and technicians from the Liaoning Tussah Silk Company Experimental Factory, Silk Weaving Factory, and Bleaching and Dyeing Factory, under the specific guidance of Soviet expert Comrade Kejin, spent just over a month eliminating the three major defects in tussah silk quality—water marks, pilling, and fading. At the same time, they also reduced yellowing, bringing the quality of our country's tussah silk ahead of Japan and Switzerland, surpassing the United Kingdom, and reaching the forefront of the world's standards.
    In the past, water marks, pilling, and fading were quality defects in tussah silk, which not only caused trouble for customers but also affected the country's foreign exchange income. This has been a matter of concern for several years, but the problem has never been solved. After the engineers and technicians of these three factories improved the processing methods under the guidance of Soviet experts, tussah silk no longer produces water marks even after being washed hundreds of times with warm water, boiling water, and soapy water. There is also no pilling phenomenon after rubbing the tussah silk more than two hundred times with testing instruments.

    柞蚕绸不起毛不褪色了
    本报讯　辽宁柞蚕丝绸公司试验厂、绢绸工厂和漂练厂的工程技术人员，在苏联专家柯金同志的具体指导下，仅仅用一个多月的时间，就消灭了柞蚕绸质量上的三害——水渍、起毛和褪色，同时还减少了反黄程度，使我国柞蚕绸的质量赶过了日本、瑞士，压倒了英国，跑到了世界水平的最前面。
    过去，柞蚕绸上有水渍、起毛和褪色的质量疵点，不仅给顾客添了麻烦，也影响了国家的外汇收入。几年来，这是人们所关心的大事，可是问题始终没有得到解决。经过这三个厂的工程技术人员在苏联专家指导下改进了加工处理方法以后，现在，用温水、沸水和肥皂水洗上几百次，柞蚕绸也不再产生水渍的现象了。用试验仪器磨擦柞绢绸二百多次，也没有起毛现象。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（安东日报工业组）
