Tibetan Students in the Great Leap Forward
    Visiting Tibetan Students at the Central Institute for Nationalities
    By our reporter Ma Wei, Gelai

On the eve of the seventh anniversary of the signing of the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," I visited Tibetan students studying at the Central Institute for Nationalities in Beijing.

As soon as I entered the school gate, I saw young men and women of all ethnic groups jubilantly celebrating in the squares of the new buildings and in the green, shady campus. Among them were many Tibetan students. Some came from cities such as Lhasa, Xigaze, and Qamdo, some from the Qiangtang area of northern Tibet and the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and some from the shores of Qinghai Lake and the vast Gannan grasslands.

The first Tibetan student I spoke to, Songduo Sonam Zhuoga, excitedly said: "Coming to the interior of the motherland and seeing the great construction and prosperous and happy scene of the motherland, I am filled with confidence in building a new Tibet." Indeed, she spoke the minds of all Tibetan students.

At the school, they participated in a series of political movements, which raised their socialist ideological awareness. Last year, when the rightists attacked the Party and slandered the Party's ethnic policies, they immediately posted a large number of big-character posters denouncing the rightists' rumors and slanders. Tibetan student Ngawang severely questioned in his big-character poster: "Who built the two highways on the roof of the world? Who gave us interest-free agricultural loans? Who helped us drive away imperialism? Who is selflessly helping us build a new home?" He said: We, the broad masses of Tibetan people, know these things as clearly as a lamp and as clearly as water. He also said: Without the Communist Party, there would be no happiness for our Tibetan people.

In various movements, many model figures have emerged, indicating their political progress. Apei Renchen, Queni, and Gongga Mingqiu have consistently studied well, united well, and worked well, becoming models for the students, and were elected as models. Gongga Mingqiu also gloriously joined the Communist Party of China last year.

In the reading room, I saw a Tibetan student named Fang Ren, who was reading the Tibet Daily. He said that the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region's decision to abolish the corvée tax for Tibetan cadres and students is great news for us, and I thank the great Communist Party of China with immense joy.

In the classroom of Preparatory Course One, I saw the students concentrating on doing exercises, some doing exercises on plants and animals and physics, and some reviewing world geography and modern Chinese history. A female student, Dunzhu Zhuoma, told me that in the past, they used to count on their fingers and prayer beads, but now they can use algebra and geometry to explain factors and find areas.

Outside the classroom, the dazzling array of bulletin boards was covered with their big-character posters and Great Leap Forward plans. At the Great Leap Forward conference, the Tibetan students presented letters of determination to the Party. Their slogan is: "Show revolutionary vigor, work hard for five years, and build a new Tibet." Their Great Leap Forward plan is: In learning: eliminate threes, strive for fives. Ideologically: promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology, be both red and expert.

Before I left, I visited the students' dormitory. These houses were bright and clean, making people feel very comfortable. A dormitory in Preparatory Course One housed eleven students, including five Tibetan students, as well as students from other fraternal ethnic groups such as Miao, Yao, Naxi, and Yi. Tibetan student Ma Runchun told me that they are very closely united; they help each other in their studies and take care of each other when they are sick, like sisters. She also excitedly said that she has joined the Communist Youth League, which is the most glorious thing for her, and she is determined to study harder, strive for better results, and aspire to be a doctor to treat the Tibetan people. Just as we were talking enthusiastically, student Wangdui came over and rushed to say: "I want to be a glorious worker and return to Tibet to build factories so that there will be chimneys and roaring motors everywhere on the plateau, just like in the interior." At this time, everyone in the room laughed happily. (Attached picture)

    藏族学员在跃进中
    访中央民族学院藏族学员
    本报记者　马威·格来
    在庆祝“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”签订七周年的前夕，我访问了在北京中央民族学院学习的藏族学员。
    一走进校门，就看到在一幢幢崭新建筑物的广场上，在绿树荫浓的校园里欢腾着的各民族的男女青年。其中有不少藏族学员。他们有的来自拉萨、日喀则、昌都等城市，有的来自藏北羌塘和雅鲁藏布江南岸，有的来自青海湖畔和辽阔的甘南草原。
    和我第一个谈话的藏族学员松多·索南卓嘎兴奋地说：“来到祖国内地，看到祖国伟大的建设和富强康乐的繁荣景象，就充满了建设新西藏的信心”。的确，她说出了全体藏族学员的心里话。
    在学校里他们参加了一系列的政治运动，提高了社会主义思想觉悟。去年右派分子向党进攻，诬蔑党的民族政策时，他们立刻贴出了大批的大字报痛斥右派分子的造谣诬蔑。藏族学员昂旺在他的大字报里严厉地质问道：“谁把两条公路修上了世界屋脊？谁给我们发放了无息农贷？谁帮助我们赶走了帝国主义？谁正在忘我地帮助我们建设着新的家园？”他说：这些，我们广大的藏族人民知道得像灯一般的明，水一般的清，他还说：没有共产党就没有我们藏族人民的幸福。
    各项运动中，涌现出不少的模范人物，表明了他们政治上的进步。阿沛·仁青、却妮和贡噶明秋一贯学习好、团结好、劳动好成了学员们的榜样，被选为模范。贡噶明秋去年还光荣地加入了中国共产党。
    在阅览室里我看到了一个叫方仁的藏族学员，他正在阅读着西藏日报。他说，西藏自治区筹备委员会关于废除藏族干部、学员的人役税的决议是我们的大喜讯，我以万分欢乐的心情感谢伟大的中国共产党。
    在预科一部教室中，我看到同学们正聚精会神地作练习，有的在作动植物和物理的习题，有的在复习世界地理和中国近代史。女学员顿珠卓玛告诉我，过去她们算账是搬手指数念珠，现在却能用代数几何释因数求面积了。
    教室外边琳琅满目的壁报栏里，贴着他们的大字报和跃进规划。在跃进大会上，藏族学员们向党献出了决心书。他们的口号是：“拿出革命干劲，苦战五年，建设新西藏”。他们的跃进计划是：在学习上：消灭三分，争取五分。在思想上兴无灭资，红透专深。
    我在临走前参观了学员的宿舍，这些房子窗明几净，使人觉得十分舒畅。预科一部的一个宿舍里住着十一个学员，除了五个藏族学员外，还有苗族、瑶族、纳西族和彝族等其他各兄弟民族的学员。藏族学员玛润春告诉我，她们之间团结得很亲密；学习上互相帮助，有了病相互照顾，像亲姊妹一样。她还兴奋地说她已加入了共青团的组织，这是她最感光荣的事，她决心加倍努力学习，争取更好的成绩，立志作个医生，回去为藏族人民治病。正谈得起劲的时候，学员旺堆凑拢来抢着说：“我要作一个光荣的工人，回到西藏去建设工厂，让高原上也像内地一样到处有烟囱，到处有轰轰的马达声。”这时满屋子的人都高兴得大笑起来。（附图片）
