Title: The Path Must Be Right

The way Liling County, Hunan Province, has successfully developed its local industry in just a few months is remarkable. How did they achieve this? It should be said that, first and foremost, they chose the right path.

To build socialism, one must have a correct policy, just as a traveler must have a correct direction. As long as the path is right—the policy is correct—even if there are other minor problems, they won't affect the overall situation. Conversely, if the path is wrong, even with other attractive aspects, things still won't go well. This may sound like an old saying, and everyone knows that revolution and construction require correct policies. It is precisely because we have followed the correct line and policies that we have achieved victory after victory. Generally speaking, this is indeed the case. However, this does not mean that every place, every unit, every worker, in our practical work, executes the Party's policies with absolute precision and 100% correctness. If that were the case, it would be somewhat illogical. The reality is that in individual places, units, and among individual personnel, hesitation often arises when policies encounter practical problems. Taking the large-scale development of local industry as an example, there are two important policy questions: one is who local industry serves, and the other is how to develop local industry. The Party's policy is very clear: the primary object of service of local industry is agriculture (this is fundamental), followed by service to national large-scale industry, the livelihood of urban and rural people, and exports. Liling County's success in developing local industry is due to its earnest implementation of these two policies. Throughout the country, due to great enthusiasm and correct policies, local industries have sprung up like "bamboo shoots after the rain."

However, we have also heard news that some places prioritize the most profitable products when developing industry. Don't misunderstand, it's not that comrades with this kind of thinking are only focused on making money. They want to lay a "foundation" first, accumulate more capital, and then achieve large-scale development. The intention is not bad, but the approach is somewhat off the right track. It is said that the sugar industry is highly profitable, therefore it is the most attractive. Some places, regardless of the source of raw materials or market conditions, are eager to try. Of course, local industries cannot engage in loss-making ventures; they must have their own accumulation. However, it is not acceptable for everyone to engage in high-profit industries regardless of service objects. For example, if everyone opens sugar factories, who will take care of the manufacturing and repair of farm tools? We have also heard that some places are not as interested in developing small and very small industries, and still want to make them grander. From this, it can be seen that although policies are easy to understand, they must be implemented in practice. This is not as easy as talking about it. Liling County's focus on developing local industries around various aspects of agricultural production has both promoted the great leap forward in agricultural production and greatly developed local industry. This shows that correct policies can lead to success. Trying to find another shortcut to achieve the goal is often counterproductive, and ultimately leads to a dead end. The importance of a correct path—policy—lies in this, as it can save us from the danger of "hitting a wall." Comrades at the special district and county levels, in particular, should pay attention to this point when developing industry.

    路子要走对
    陈之衍
    湖南省醴陵县在短短的几个月内，把地方工业办得很出色，若问效果如何得来？应当说首先是他们的路子走得很对。
    办社会主义事业，一定要有正确的方针，好像赶路的人一定要有一个正确的方向一样。只要路子走对了——方针正确了，那怕出一点其它的毛病，也不会影响到大局。可是反过来，路子走得不对，其它方面虽然花团锦簇，事情照样办不好。说起来这也是老话，谁不知道闹革命、搞建设要方针正确呢？正是由于我们走的方针路线正确，我们才取得了一个又一个的胜利。从总的方面来说，事实确是这样。但这并不等于说，我们在实际工作中，每一个地方、每一个单位、每一个工作人员，执行党的方针全都是不偏不倚、百分之百正确的。如果真的这样，倒有点不大合乎逻辑了。实际情况倒是个别地方、个别单位、个别人员在方针一接触到实际问题时，常常还表现出摇摆不定。拿大办地方工业来说，有两个重要的方针性问题，一是地方工业为谁服务，一是怎样办地方工业。党的方针非常明确，地方工业服务的对象首先是为农业服务（这是基本的），其次是为国家大工业服务、为城乡人民生活服务、为出口服务。办地方工业的方法是走群众路线，以小型为主，就地取材，由初级到高级。醴陵县办地方工业办得好，就是因为切实执行了这两条方针。全国各地也是由于劲头足，方针对，地方工业出现了“雨后春笋”的局面。
    然而我们也听到这样的消息，说有的地方办工业的着眼点首先放在：那种产品最赚钱就办那种工业。不要误会，以为有这种思想的同志，只是一心为了赚钱。他们是想先打下点“基础”，多积累些资金，然后再来大发展。心不谓不好，可是做法毕竟有点儿离开了正路。据说制糖工业的利润比较大，因此也最吸引人，有些地方不管原料来源，市场情况如何，都跃跃欲试。当然要地方工业干赔钱买卖是不行的，地方工业必须要有自己的积累。但是大家都去搞那种利润大的而不管服务对象也是不行的，比方说都去开糖厂，那末农具的制造修配等等谁来管呢？我们还听说有的地方对办小型和小小型的工业，兴趣不那样浓，总还想弄得气派大一些。由此可见，方针虽然很容易明白，但方针必须在实际中贯彻。这就不是像口头上说说那样容易了。醴陵县围绕着农业生产的各个环节办地方工业，既推动了农业生产的大跃进，又大大发展了地方工业，这说明方针对了就能把事情办好。如果想另外找一条小路来达到目的，往往是事倍功半，最后还是此路不通。路子——方针正确的重要性即在于此，可以使我们免去“碰壁”的危险，专、县以下办工业的同志特别要注意这一点。
