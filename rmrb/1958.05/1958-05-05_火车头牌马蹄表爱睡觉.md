    "Locomotive" Brand Wristwatch Likes to Sleep
    In January of this year, I spent more than 17 yuan at the Jilin City No. 1 Department Store to buy a "Locomotive" brand wristwatch produced by the Shanghai Joint State-Private Far East Clock Factory. The watch looked very good on the outside. After I brought it home, a neighbor also took a fancy to it and asked me to buy one for him the next day. When they were first bought, both watches were sometimes half an hour fast or half an hour slow in a day, and they were never accurate for a single day. In less than a month, my neighbor's watch suddenly stopped. It cost him more than two yuan to have it repaired at a watch shop. But after bringing it back, it still didn't work. Now it can only be placed on the table as a useless decoration. Less than ten days after my neighbor's watch broke, mine also stopped working. Because I didn't have money to repair it, I had to leave it on the table. My neighbors were so angry that they made up a jingle for it: "Shanghai 'horseshoe' watch, the appearance is okay, costs a lot of money, but it likes to sleep." When will the quality of these "sleeping" watches be improved?

    火车头牌马蹄表爱睡觉
    今年1月间，我在吉林市第一百货商店花十七元多钱买了一只上海公私合营远东造钟厂出品的火车头牌马蹄表。这个表从外表看来很好，我把表拿回家以后，一个邻居也看中了，第二天就托我给代买一只。初买时，这两只表都是有时一天快半小时，有时一天慢半小时，没有一天走得准确。不到一个月，邻居那块表突然停了，拿到表店去修理花了两元多。可是拿回来以后，仍然是不走。现在只好当无用的装饰品放在桌子上。邻居的表坏了不到十天，我的表也不走了。因为没有钱修理，只好在桌子上放着。邻居们气不过，给他编了顺口溜：“上海马蹄表，外表还算好，花钱不算少，可是爱睡觉。”这种爱睡觉的表什么时候才能提高质量呢？
