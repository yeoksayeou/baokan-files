　　Cheer for the Third Red Moon
　　Ren Hui
    People all over the world who love peace are cheering for the third Red Moon. Sending a one-and-a-half-ton artificial Earth satellite into orbit is another great encouragement to peace-loving people all over the world, and another heavy blow to the likes of Eisenhower and Dulles.

    Since the Soviet Union's first Red Moon went into space on October 4 last year, American imperialists have exhausted every ounce of their energy to launch three small artificial satellites, the largest of which—"Explorer III"—weighed 14.29 kilograms. Compared with the Red Moon launched the day before yesterday, the weight ratio is almost one to one hundred. An ant racing against a steed; the superiority, speed, and outcome are already very clear. One hundred to one is an overwhelming advantage, and this advantage shows that in a decisive scientific and technological competition, the United States has been far surpassed by the Soviet Union. Moreover, it is very unlikely that this gap in backwardness can be caught up.

    The socialist world takes the lead and throws the capitalist world far, far behind, which has fundamentally changed the balance of power between the two worlds. If the Soviet Union can launch a one-and-a-half-ton artificial satellite into the high altitude of 1,800 kilometers, Eisenhower and Dulles cannot but think of the power of the Soviet intercontinental ballistic missile. This association can cause them to lose sleep, tremble, and more realistically consider the issue of the balance of power. With such power in the socialist camp, things in the world will be easier to handle, peace will be more guaranteed, and mothers and children on the five continents of the world can sleep more soundly.

    The launch of this one-and-a-half-ton Red Moon has an even greater role in dispelling superstitions for those with "fear-America" disease in the world today. For many years, imperialists have consistently used a "web of lies" to boast and scare, creating a false image of "America first" in the minds of many people who lack confidence. Now, these people should also wake up and think about it. In yesterday's newspaper, in addition to the launch of the third artificial satellite, people can also see the news that the American economic crisis is getting more and more serious and that Nixon is being scolded and beaten everywhere in South America. Facts are the most eloquent. Please look at today's world. Is it the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind, or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind? In the past, the capitalist system and the imperialist world were indeed strong and formidable. However, their golden age has passed, and the sun at six o'clock in the afternoon is no longer "infinitely good" but "near dusk."

    The socialist world, led by the Soviet Union, is simultaneously pursuing a triumphant advance on two fronts. On the ground, the forces of peace are overwhelming the forces of war, and in the sky, the universe and nature can no longer maintain their so-called "eternal mystery" and superstition. The world is changing, the universe is changing, interstellar travel is no longer a fantasy, and the day of realizing the wish of "human domination of the universe" seems to be not too far away.

### 向第三个红色月亮欢呼

　　向第三个红色月亮欢呼
　　任晦
    全世界爱好和平的人民在向第三颗红月亮欢呼。把一吨半重的人造地球卫星送上轨道，这是对全世界爱好和平人民的又一个极大的鼓舞，是对艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流的又一次沉重的打击。
    从去年10月4日苏联第一颗红月亮上了天之后，美国帝国主义者使尽了吃奶的力量，才放出了三颗小小的人造卫星，其中最大的一颗——“探险者三号”，计重一四点二九公斤，这和前天上天的红月亮比较起来，在重量上差不多是一与一百之比。蚂蚁与骏马赛跑，优劣、快慢与胜负之数，已经是很清楚了。一百比一是一个压倒的优势，这一个优势说明了在一场决定性的科学技术竞赛中，美国已经远远地被抛在苏联的后面，而且，这一个落后的差距，已经很难有赶上的可能性了。
    社会主义世界一马当先，把资本主义世界很远很远地抛在后面，这就使两个世界的力量对比，发生了根本性质的变化。苏联可以把一吨半重的人造卫星抛上一千八百公里的高空，艾森豪威尔和杜勒斯之流就不能不联想到苏联洲际弹道火箭的威力。这个联想可以使他们失眠，可以使他们发抖，也可以使他们比较现实地考虑一下力量对比的问题。社会主义阵营有了这样的力量，世界上的事情就比较好办，和平就比较有了保证，世界五大洲的母亲和孩子，就可以睡得比较安稳了。
    这一颗一吨半重的红月亮的升天，对于现在世界上的那些恐美病患者，更有巨大的破除迷信的作用。多少年来，帝国主义者一贯用“谎言的罗网”来吹嘘吓唬，在许多缺乏信心的人们中间，造成了一种什么都是“美国第一”的假象。现在，这些人也应该清醒地想一想了，就在昨天这一天的报上，除出第三颗人造卫星上了天之外，人们还可以看到美国经济危机日益严重和尼克松在南美到处挨骂挨打的消息，事实最雄辩，请看今日的世界，究竟是东风压倒西风呢，还是西风压倒东风？资本主义制度，帝国主义世界，在过去，的确是曾经强盛过、厉害过的，可是现在，他们的黄金时代已经过去，下午六点钟的太阳，已经不是“无限好”而是“近黄昏”了。
    以苏联为首的社会主义世界，正在两条战线上同时的乘胜追击。在地面上，和平力量压倒了战争力量，在天空中，宇宙和大自然也已经不能再保持它的所谓“永恒的神秘”和迷信了。世界在变，宇宙在变，星际旅行已经不再是空想，实现“人支配宇宙”这个愿望的日子，看来是已经不太远了。
