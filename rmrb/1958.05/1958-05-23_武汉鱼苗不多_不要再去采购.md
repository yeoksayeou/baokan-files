    Wuhan Has Few Fish Fry, Do Not Come to Purchase Any More
    Recently, many provinces and cities have sent people to Wuhan to purchase fish fry without prior contact. They arrived only to find that there were no fish fry available, and they returned empty-handed, resulting in a huge loss of national financial and human resources. Because Wuhan has a large fish fry export task, and the supply of fish fry is planned, there are no surplus fish fry available for export at present. Therefore, if provinces, cities, and counties want to come to Wuhan to purchase fish fry, it is best to contact us by letter in advance to avoid a futile trip.
    On the other hand, we have also explained to the suburban fishing (agricultural) cooperatives and state-owned breeding farms the urgent need for fish fry across the country. They have all pledged to guarantee, catch more fish fry, and do their best to increase production to meet the needs of various places.

    武汉鱼苗不多  不要再去采购
    最近不少省市派人来武汉市购买鱼苗，事先没有联系，来了买不到鱼苗，空手而回，使国家的财力人力造成巨大的损失。因武汉市的鱼苗外销任务很大，同时鱼苗是有计划供应，现在已没有多余的鱼苗外销。因此请各省、市、县若要来武汉市采购鱼苗，最好先来信联系一下，以免徒劳往返。
    另一方面我们也向郊区渔（农）业社和国营养殖场说明全国各地迫切需要鱼苗的情况，他们都提出了保证，要多多捕捞鱼苗，尽最大的努力提高产量，来满足各地需要。
