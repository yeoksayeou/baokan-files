Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 14th: TASS reports: President Nasser of the United Arab Republic hosted a banquet for Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, on the 13th at the Grand Kremlin Palace.

On the Soviet side, the attendees included Aristov, Voroshilov, Ignatov, Kozlov, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Khrushchev, Shvernik, Kosygin, as well as Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, ministers, marshals of the Soviet Union, and generals.

President Nasser spoke at the banquet. He said, "We will never forget the cordial hospitality of the Soviet people. We are deeply convinced that these days we have spent together with the Soviet people are of great significance for the future relations between the people of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic." Nasser concluded by expressing his hope that the efforts made by the Soviet leaders in all aspects would achieve the expected goals.

Next, Voroshilov spoke. He said, "The Soviet Union has been and will always be a loyal, selfless, and reliable friend to the Arab people in strengthening their independence, peace, and security. We hope to see the United Arab Republic and other countries in the East become strong, independent countries, and hope that they will confidently move forward on the path of progress and prosperity. The good development of relations between the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic once again confirms that countries with different socio-political systems can completely coexist peacefully and cooperate in a friendly manner."

Voroshilov emphasized that the United Arab Republic is located in a region close to the southern border of the Soviet Union. Like the United Arab Republic, the Soviet Union very much hopes that this region will be peaceful and tranquil, and hopes that this region can eliminate the tensions caused by the interference of certain major powers. If other countries in this region also pursue a policy of peace and are not at the mercy of foreign aggressor forces, then the Middle East will become a region of consolidated peace.

　　伏老在纳赛尔招待会上说
    中近东国家摆脱外国干涉就会成为巩固和平的地区
    据新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：阿拉伯联合共和国总统纳赛尔13日在大克里姆林宫设宴招待苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席伏罗希洛夫。
    苏联方面参加宴会的有阿里斯托夫、伏罗希洛夫、伊格纳托夫、科兹洛夫、米高扬、穆希金诺夫、赫鲁晓夫、什维尔尼克、柯西金，以及苏联部长会议副主席、各部部长、苏联元帅、将军等。
    纳赛尔总统在宴会上讲了话。他说，我们永远不会忘记苏联人民的殷勤招待。我们深信，我们同苏联人民共同度过的这些日子对今后苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国两国人民的互相关系具有重大意义。纳赛尔最后表示希望苏联领导人在各方面所作的努力都能达到预期的目的。
    接着，伏罗希洛夫讲话。他说，苏联过去和今后永远是阿拉伯各国人民在加强他们的独立、和平和安全各方面的忠实、无私和可靠的朋友。我们希望看到阿拉伯联合共和国以及东方的其他国家都成为强大、独立的国家，希望它们满怀信心地沿着进步和繁荣的道路前进。苏联同阿拉伯联合共和国之间的关系发展得很好，这再次证实社会政治制度不同的国家完全有可能和平相处和友好合作。
    伏罗希洛夫强调指出，阿拉伯联合共和国位于同苏联南部国境接近的地区。苏联和阿拉伯联合共和国一样，非常希望这个地区得到安宁和和平，希望这个地区能够消除由于某些大国的干涉所造成的紧张局势。如果这个地区的其他国家也奉行和平和不受外国侵略势力摆布的政策，那么中近东就会成为巩固和平的地区。
