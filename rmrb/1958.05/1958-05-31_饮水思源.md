    Notes
    The American state machine is the "number one plunderer" abroad; domestically, it is also the most remarkable "number one plunderer" in the world.
    America's April "Courier Magazine" honestly admitted: "Forty years ago, the United States had the least debt and the lightest taxes of all countries, but today we are the country with the most debt and the heaviest taxes." Although having "the most debt and the heaviest taxes," the American people even have difficulty getting water. The magazine said: "Today, a quarter of our country (the United States) lacks water, has unclean drinking water, or both lacks water and has unclean drinking water."
    The US government spends a lot of money on creating tensions and engaging in the arms race, and does not care about the living problems of the American people at all. "Courier Magazine" also believes that the US government should not always "scare" people, and should let some scientists "focus" on solving the "water" problem.

    饮水思源
    美国的国家机器，对外是“头号掠夺者”；对内，也是世界上最了不起的“头号掠夺者”。
    美国4月份“信使杂志”老实地承认：“四十年前，美国在所有国家中债务最少，捐税最轻，而今天，我们却是债务最多，捐税最重的国家。”虽然“债务最多，捐税最重”，但是美国人民连用水都要发生困难。这个杂志说：“今天，我国（美国）有四分之一居民缺水、饮水不洁或者既缺水又饮水不洁。”
    美国政府把大量的钱花在制造紧张局势和进行军备竞赛上，丝毫不关心美国人民的生活问题。“信使杂志”也认为，美国政府不要老是“吓唬”人了，应该让一些科学家“专心”去解决“用水”问题。
