Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou: Guangdong Province is holding a large-scale provincial agricultural tool reform promotion and evaluation exhibition at the Sino-Soviet Friendship Building in Guangzhou. By organizing mass visits, evaluations, and discussions, combined with inspections and appraisals by leaders and experts, the exhibition aims to conduct a relatively systematic and comprehensive review and evaluation of the agricultural tools invented, created, and reformed by the working people of the province in the previous period, identify the most advanced ones, summarize and improve them, and promote them widely throughout the province.

The exhibition has ten exhibition halls, including tilling tools, transportation tools, water conservancy tools, soil fertilizers, and agricultural product processing tools, exhibiting more than 2,900 agricultural tools. The tools on display are the most urgent, common, and large-scale needs of the peasants, and are advanced tools that can be manufactured under the existing economic and technical conditions in rural areas. These tools generally have the characteristics of simple structure, easy operation, locally sourced materials, low cost, low labor, high efficiency, and even multiple uses for one item. For example, the rice transplanting boat created by the Guishan Cooperative of Dasha Township, Xinhui County, in the tilling tools hall, costs only one yuan to make, but can greatly reduce the labor intensity of farmers, and labor efficiency can be increased by more than 30%. Replacing shoulder carrying with carts is an important task to be completed in rural Guangdong this year, and it is also the central content of the transportation tools hall of the exhibition. Here are displayed more than 200 pieces of folk transportation tools such as various vehicles and boats, including single-wheel, double-wheel, three-wheel, and four-wheel handcarts suitable for plains, as well as front and rear wheel handcarts suitable for mountain paths, slopes, and steps, as well as amphibious boats equipped with three or four wheels, as well as large carts with ball bearings and higher costs, and simple handcarts that do not cost any money and use waste plow handles, waste wooden ladders as cart handles, and old stool boards as cart wheels. Using these tools can generally increase efficiency by one to fifteen times compared to shoulder carrying. There has also been great development in the utilization of water power. The Sanhai Cooperative of Dongyu Township, Lingshan County, has built a hydropower joint processing plant, which can not only manufacture granular fertilizer, but also simultaneously grind rice, mill flour, cut vines into slices, blow wind for iron forging, clean grain, and generate electricity. Most of the parts of this "omnipotent factory," praised by the masses, are made of wood. The material cost and wages of the entire equipment is only 115 yuan, plus a generator that can supply 100 fifteen-candlepower lamps is only 445 yuan.

At present, visiting groups composed of party branch secretaries, cooperative directors (or production team leaders), and blacksmiths from various agricultural cooperatives in counties across the province are coming to Guangzhou for visits one after another. From the opening of the exhibition on April 15 to May 2, it has received more than 180,000 visitors. The exhibition organizing committee has also decided to organize experience exchange and learning activities, and supply simple models and pictures and other materials of some advanced exhibits.

Guangzhou Electric Report: Liu Shaoqi, Deng Xiaoping, Kang Sheng, Lu Dingyi, Deng Zihui and other comrades visited the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Tool Reform Exhibition being held in Guangzhou in late April. After their visit, they highly praised the creative spirit of the people. Comrade Liu Shaoqi also put forward very important opinions on the work of agricultural tool reform.

In late April, the weather in Guangzhou was as hot as summer in the north, and there were many people in the exhibition hall. The central responsible comrades, like ordinary visitors, squeezed into the ranks of visitors and enthusiastically watched most of the various agricultural tools after the innovation. Comrade Shaoqi watched for two hours in the afternoon, and when the lights of the exhibition hall were on in the evening, he came again. He watched for another three hours. He had seen almost all of the three thousand creations and inventions of the people.

The dozen or so styles of rice transplanting boats invented by the farmers of Xinhui and other counties attracted the special attention of the central responsible comrades. Our country's farmers work very hard transplanting rice all day long. But for thousands of years, no one has reformed or solved this problem. This spring, the farmers of Xinhui County invented the rice transplanting boat, using indigenous methods to solve this problem. They used a few small wooden boards to make a small boat, and people sat on it to transplant rice; seedlings were placed at the other end. A piece of cloth was hung on the top of the boat to shield the sun on sunny days and to block the rain on rainy days. Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Kang Sheng, after watching the performance, smiled and repeatedly said "good." Comrade Lu Dingyi praised the rice transplanting boat as a waterborne tank. Comrade Deng Zihui watched with fascination, sat on it, and tried it again and again. Comrade Shaoqi said that indigenous methods can solve big problems, and can be promoted in the ten southern provinces.

The central responsible comrades paid special attention to the handcarts. Comrade Liu Shaoqi squatted down next to the pure wooden handcart, stroking and observing it for ten minutes. He also carefully inquired about and observed another modern handcart with steel frame, steel axle, and rubber wheels. He compared the advantages and disadvantages of the wooden and iron handcarts. He said that the advantage of the wooden handcart is that it is cheap, but the disadvantage is that wood rubs against wood, and the efficiency is not high enough; the advantage of the iron handcart is that it has rubber wheels and bearings, and the efficiency is high, but the disadvantage is that it is expensive. He said to the responsible comrades of the province that we can take the middle ground from both ends, retain the advantages of both handcarts, and eliminate the disadvantages of both handcarts, based on the wooden handcart, wrapping rubber on the outside of the wooden wheels, and installing bearings on the wooden axles. He repeatedly emphasized the importance of bearings, hoping that Guangdong Province would run a bearing factory and mass-produce bearings. He said that doing so would not cost much, and the efficiency could be greatly improved.

The central responsible comrades gave a very good evaluation to the light double-wheel double-furrow plow modified by the Zhanjiang City Mechanical Production Cooperative. This modified double-wheel double-furrow plow uses a large amount of wood to replace iron, reducing the weight from the original 140 kilograms to 45 kilograms. It can be pulled by one cow and is as effective as the original double-wheel double-furrow plow. Comrade Deng Zihui said that this plow is more advanced than the pure iron one and can be learned from everywhere, but it can still be improved, and strive to make everything except the plowshare and screws made of iron, and all the rest replaced with wood.

The five types of hand-held tractors, non-clinker cement, and four-row harrowing machines that Guangdong Province had successfully manufactured on its own all attracted the attention of the central responsible comrades. Comrade Deng Xiaoping was particularly interested in grain dryers. After inquiring about the amount of grain dried and the cost, he said that grain storage is a big problem in our country, and with this machine, the problem will be solved. Comrade Liu Shaoqi also carefully visited the performance of small hydropower generators and models of the "omnipotent factory" in Lingshan County, the river-blocking fish net in Xinhui County, and the homemade ammonium sulfate plant in Fengjie County, Sichuan Province.

At the end of the visit, Comrade Liu Shaoqi said to the responsible comrades of Guangdong Province who accompanied him: The agricultural tool reform movement is changing quickly and changing well. This kind of technological innovation movement is like a car that has already started and will never stop, never stopping for a day, never stopping for ten thousand years. He said: Our technological revolution has already begun, but it has only just begun, and new things will continue to appear in the future. And these all rely on the creativity of the masses, relying on everyone to "use their brains and think of ways."

When Comrade Shaoqi talked about the evaluation and promotion of improved agricultural tools, he said: With so many styles, we need to compare them and find the best ones to promote. When comparing, in addition to consulting with workers and farmers, we also need to invite mechanical engineers to come and study together, help appraise, and think of ways. Comrade Shaoqi believes that the agricultural tool reform exhibition is a good way to educate the masses, and such exhibitions can be held everywhere.

When the central responsible comrades left the exhibition hall, they shook hands with the staff of the conference one by one to thank them. When Comrade Liu Shaoqi was about to leave the exhibition hall, some people recognized him, and the masses cheered and applauded him. Comrade Shaoqi also smiled and waved to everyone.

    改得很快　改得很好
    一天不停万年不停
    广东举办农具改革推广展览会  少奇同志等赞扬农民创造精神
    据新华社广州讯　广东省正在广州市中苏友好大厅举办一个规模很大的全省农具改革推广评比展览会，通过组织群众参观、评比、讨论，结合领导和专家的检验鉴定，对全省劳动人民在前一时期发明、创造和改革的农具，进行一次比较系统全面的检阅、评比，找出其中最先进的加以总结、提高，在省内普遍推广。
    这次展览会共设有耕耘工具、运输工具、水利工具、土壤肥料、农产品加工工具等十个展览馆，共展出农具二千九百多件。展出的工具，都是当前农民群众所最迫切最普遍最大量的需要，而又是在农村现有的经济条件和技术条件下可以制造的先进工具。这些工具大都具有构造简单，操作轻便，就地取材，造价低廉，费力小，收效大，甚至一物可以几用的特点。如耕耘工具馆里展出的新会县大沙乡圭山社创制的插秧船，造价只要一块钱，却能大大减轻农民的劳动强度，劳动效率可以提高30％以上。用车子代替肩挑，是广东农村要在今年上半年内完成的一项重要工作，也是展览会运输工具馆的中心内容。这里陈列有种种车辆和船艇等民间运输工具二百多件，有适合平原地区用的单轮、双轮、三轮、四轮手推车，也有适合于山区小路、斜坡和上下石级的前后轮手推车，以及装有三轮或四轮的水陆两用船，还有装置滚珠轴承、造价较高的大车，和完全不用花钱而利用废犁柄、废木梯作车把、旧凳板作车轮的简易手推车。利用这些工具比肩挑一般能提高效率一倍到十五倍。其他如水力的利用也有很大的发展，灵山县东圩乡三海社建成了一座水力联合加工厂，既可以制造颗粒肥料，又可以同时碾米、磨粉、切蔓切片、鼓风打铁、净谷和发电。这座被群众赞誉为“万能工厂”的所有机件，绝大部分是用木制的，全部设备的材料费和工资仅仅花了一百一十五元，加上一部可供一百盏十五支烛光电灯的发电机也才不过四百四十五元。
    目前，全省各地以县为单位组成的，包括各个农业社的党支部书记、社主任（或生产队长）和铁木匠等人员的参观团，陆续来到广州参观。展览会从4月15日开幕到5月2日止，就接待过观众十八万多人。展览会筹委会还决定组织经验交流学习活动，并供应部分先进展品的简易模型和图片等资料。
    本报广州电　刘少奇、邓小平、康生、陆定一、邓子恢等同志，4月下旬先后参观了正在广州举行的广东省农具改革展览会。他们参观完后，对人民群众的创造精神评价很高。刘少奇同志还对农具改革工作提出了很重要的意见。
    4月下旬，广州的天气有北方的夏天那么热，展览会里人又多，中央负责同志像普通观众一样，挤在参观者的行列里，兴致勃勃地看过了大部分的革新后的各种农具。少奇同志下午看了两个钟头，晚上当展览会的灯火亮起来后，他又来了。他再看了足足三个钟头。展览会的三千件人民群众的创造和发明，他几乎全看过了。
    新会等县农民群众发明的十几种式样的插秧船，引起了中央负责同志的特别注意。我国农民整天弯着腰插秧十分辛苦。但是千百年来无人改革，无人解决。今年春天，新会县的农民发明了插秧船，用土办法把这个问题解决了。他们用几块小木头板，做成小船，人坐在上边插秧；另一端放秧苗。小船上顶头挂上一块布，晴日可以遮太阳，雨天可以挡雨。邓小平、康生同志看过表演后，笑着连声说好。陆定一同志把插秧船誉为水上坦克。邓子恢同志看得出神，坐了上去，试了又试。少奇同志说，土办法解决大问题，南方十省都可以推广。
    中央负责同志都特别仔细地参观了手推车。刘少奇同志在纯木制手推车旁，蹲下去抚摸，观察有十分钟之久。他又细细地询问和观察了另一辆钢架、钢轴胶轮的现代化手推车。他把木制铁制两种手推车的优缺点作了比较。他说，木制手推车的优点是价钱便宜，缺点是木头磨木头，效率不够高；铁制手推车的优点是有胶轮有轴承效率高，缺点是价钱大。他对省的负责同志说，我们可以去两头取中间，保留两种手推车的优点，去掉两种手推车的缺点，以木制手推车为基础，木轮外边包胶皮，木轴上安轴承。他再三强调轴承的重要，希望广东省办轴承工厂，大量生产轴承。他说，这么做，花钱不多，效率可以提高很多。
    中央负责同志对湛江市机械生产合作社改制的那部轻便双轮双铧犁，给予了很好的评价。这部改制后的双轮双铧犁，用大量木料代替铁料，重量由原来的一百四十公斤减到四十五公斤，用一头牛就能拉得起，功效和原来的双轮双铧犁相当。邓子恢同志说，这部犁比纯铁制的先进，各地都可以学习，但是还可以改进，争取做到除了犁铧和螺丝钉是铁制的以外，都用木料代替。
    广东省各地自制成功的五种手扶拖拉机、无熟料水泥、四行耙田器，都引起了中央负责同志的注意。邓小平同志特别对谷物干燥机感到兴趣。他询问了谷物干燥量和造价后说，我国谷物储藏是个大问题，有了这种机器，问题便解决了。刘少奇同志还仔细地参观了小型水力发电机的表演和灵山县的万能工厂、新会县的拦河鱼网，四川省奉节县土制硫酸氨厂等模型。
    结束参观的时候，刘少奇同志对陪同他参观的广东省负责同志说：农具改革运动，改得很快，改得很好。这样的技术革新运动，像一部车子，已经开动了，永远不会停止，一天不停，一万年不停。他说：我国的技术革命已经开始，但是，它刚在开始，以后新东西会不断出现。而这些全靠群众的创造性，靠大家“开动脑筋，想出办法”。
    少奇同志谈到改良农具的评比、推广工作时说：这么多样子，要比较一下，找出最好的推广。比较的时候，除了和工人、农民商量外，还要把搞机械制造的工程师请来，和他们共同研究，帮助鉴定一下，想想办法。少奇同志认为，农具改革展览会是个教育群众的好办法，各地都可以开这样的展览会。
    中央负责同志离开展览会时，和大会工作人员一一握手，感谢他们。刘少奇同志快离开展览会时，叫一些群众认出来了，群众向他欢呼，鼓掌，少奇同志也笑着频频向大家招手。（附图片）
