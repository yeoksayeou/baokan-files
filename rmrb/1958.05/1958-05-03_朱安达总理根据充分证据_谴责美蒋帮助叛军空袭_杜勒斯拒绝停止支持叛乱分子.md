Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta – Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda issued a statement on April 30 stating that the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique had aided Indonesian rebels in bombing some Indonesian areas. The Indonesian government has obtained ample evidence in this regard.

The statement pointed out that the rebels have only two Indonesian pilots. Airplanes cannot obtain gasoline in and around Manado, as the gasoline supply equipment there has been destroyed.

Djuanda said that the conclusion can be drawn that the pilots were hired by the rebels, and reports we have received from Manado indicate that these pilots are Americans and members of Chiang Kai-shek's group from Taiwan. Djuanda also said that, in addition, the inference can be made that the gasoline used was illegally imported from abroad.

The Indonesian government has evidence that between April 25 and 30, shoulder-fired automatic weapons and fighter planes were smuggled in from Taiwan.

In the statement, Djuanda said that due to the actions taken by American and Chiang Kai-shek clique adventurers, strong indignation has been generated among the Indonesian armed forces and people towards the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and if this situation is allowed to develop, it will only have extremely harmful effects on relations between Indonesia and the United States.

The statement called for clear efforts to ensure that Americans do not provide the rebels with any form of assistance, such as buying and selling weapons, selling airplanes, ships, or any other means of transportation, or providing convenience for their use, sending their technicians to engage in war purposes, and providing convenience for the use of air force bases under their control.

Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd – Washington news: U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference held on the 1st, indicated his refusal to stop U.S. support for the activities of Indonesian rebels.

In response to questions from reporters, Dulles attempted to portray U.S. support for the activities of Indonesian rebels as individual actions unrelated to the government. He acknowledged what U.S. President Eisenhower said on April 30, that some American "adventurers" support the Indonesian rebellion, and "there are Americans engaged in such adventurous undertakings all over the world." However, Dulles said that the U.S. government has "no legal obligation to control activities of this nature by Americans."

A reporter asked Dulles whether his remarks were a response to the statement by Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda. Dulles replied that the United States has not yet responded to Djuanda's statement.

    朱安达总理根据充分证据
    谴责美蒋帮助叛军空袭
    杜勒斯拒绝停止支持叛乱分子
    据新华社雅加达电　印度尼西亚总理朱安达4月30日发表声明说，美国和蒋介石集团曾经帮助印度尼西亚叛乱分子轰炸一些印度尼西亚地区。印度尼西亚政府已经在这方面掌握了充分的证据。
    声明指出，叛乱分子只有两个印度尼西亚籍的飞行员。飞机在万鸦老和它的周围地区是得不到汽油的，那里的供应汽油的设备已经遭到破坏。
    朱安达说，能够得出这样的结论：飞行员是由叛乱分子雇用的，我们从万鸦老获得的报告表明，这些飞行员是美国人和台湾蒋介石集团分子。朱安达还说，除此之外，还可以作出这样的推论：使用的汽油是从国外非法输入的。
    印度尼西亚政府已经掌握这样的证据：在4月25日到30日这一期间，从台湾私运进去了一些肩荷式自动武器以及战斗机。
    朱安达在声明中说，由于美国和蒋介石集团的冒险分子采取这种行动，在印度尼西亚武装部队和人民中间已经产生了对美国和蒋介石集团的强烈的愤慨情绪，如果让这种情况发展下去，那只会对印度尼西亚和美国之间的关系产生极其有害的影响。
    声明要求作出明确的努力，以使美国人不给叛军以任何形式的援助，例如：买卖武器，出售飞机、船只或任何其他交通运输工具或者给予使用的便利，派遣他们的技术人员从事战争的目的，提供使用在他们控制之下的空军基地的便利。
    据新华社2日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿杜勒斯在1日举行的记者招待会上，表示拒绝停止美国支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子的活动。
    杜勒斯在回答记者们的问题时企图把美国支持印度尼西亚叛乱分子的活动说成是同政府无关的个人行动。他承认美国总统艾森豪威尔4月30日说过的话，有一些美国“冒险家”支持印度尼西亚的叛乱，而且“在全世界都有美国人从事这样的冒险事业”。但是，杜勒斯说，美国政府“在法律上没有义务去控制美国人的这种性质的活动”。
    有记者问杜勒斯，他的这番话是不是对印度尼西亚总理朱安达的声明的答复。杜勒斯回答说，美国对朱安达的声明还没有作答复。
