    (Our report) According to the Sichuan Daily: Baoxing County, Sichuan Province, has launched a magnificent upsurge in the great leap forward of cultural and educational undertakings. By the end of April, the county had newly established thirteen middle schools and one hundred and twenty-five primary schools. At present, the county has basically popularized primary and secondary education. Every commune has a primary school, and on average, every township has a middle school. More than 90% of school-age children and young and middle-aged illiterate people have enrolled in school. The masses said: The long-cherished wish to learn culture has been realized today. Parents are sending their children to school to study. All thirty school-age children in the Baila Cooperative of the Xinxing Township have enrolled this time.

    The county has established a rural cultural network centered on rural clubs. Every commune has established a club, and every township has organized amateur theatrical troupes and writing groups. Production teams have universally carried out singing activities, and more than 360 singing teams have now been formed.

    Amateur theatrical troupes and clubs in various townships and communes have launched activities. The entire Longdong District and the Daxi and Zhongba townships of the Lingguan District held sports meets and art performances during the "May Day" holiday. At the "May Day" evening party held by Chengguan Township, the most eye-catching event was a folk song team composed of old ladies over fifty years old. They sang the folk song "The people of the whole country smile when they see Chairman Mao," which was warmly welcomed by the masses.
