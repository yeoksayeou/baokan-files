Notes

    The Value of a Lackey
    American columnist Brown wrote in the "Washington Star" when commenting on Turkish Prime Minister Menderes' recent visit to the Far East: "The Turkish 'strongman' visits the Far East," especially his visits to South Korea and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan, "which has great significance and value for the political and strategic interests of the United States in the region." It is said that "experts" at the US State Department also hold the same view.
    Brown's words inadvertently revealed the bottom line of Menderes' activities in the Far East: it turned out that Menderes' shouts of solidarity and security of the "free world" and attempts to piece together a Northeast Asian aggressive alliance were all in service of the "political and strategic interests" of the United States. The so-called "strongman" is just a lackey of the United States.

    奴才的价值
    美国专栏作家布朗在“华盛顿明星报”上评论最近土耳其总理曼德列斯访问远东时写道：“土耳其‘硬汉’访问远东”，特别是访问南朝鲜和台湾蒋介石集团，“对于美国在该地区的政治与战略利益，具有重大的意义和价值”。据说，美国国务院的“专家”也持有同样的看法。
    布朗的这一段话，倒是无意中揭开了曼德列斯到远东活动的底牌：原来曼德列斯叫喊“自由世界”的团结和安全，企图拼凑东北亚侵略联盟等等，都是为了美国的“政治和战略利益”服务。所谓“硬汉”不过是美国的奴才而已。
