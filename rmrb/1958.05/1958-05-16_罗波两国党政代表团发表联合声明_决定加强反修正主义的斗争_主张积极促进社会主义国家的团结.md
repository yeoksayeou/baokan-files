Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 15th: The newspapers here today published a joint statement by the Romanian and Polish Party and Government delegations. The statement said that the two delegations discussed the most important current international situation, the modern workers' movement, and the further development of relations between the two countries during the recent talks.

In discussing the international situation, the statement first pointed out that the governments of Romania and Poland, as well as the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, are pursuing a policy of peace, which is in the interests of the people of all countries. The statement condemned the war policy pursued by the imperialist blocs of the United States and other capitalist countries, and particularly pointed out that arming the West German army with nuclear weapons is a major threat to European security.

The statement said that the people of Romania and Poland resolutely oppose the imperialist policy of interfering in their internal affairs.

The two governments believe that actively promoting the further strengthening of the unity of socialist countries is their primary task.

Both sides expressed their full support for the Soviet Union's decision to halt nuclear weapons tests and its proposal to the United States and Britain for a universal cessation of nuclear weapons tests.

The Romanian government expressed its belief that the implementation of the Polish government's proposal to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe would contribute to peace in Europe. The Polish government expressed its support for the peace initiative proposed by the Romanian government to the Balkan countries in September last year.

The two governments believe that as long as the imperialist blocs do not stop implementing their policies that threaten peace, the two countries must support the Warsaw Treaty Organization.

The statement went on to say that the Romanian Workers' Party and the Polish United Workers' Party have decided to continuously promote the consolidation of unity and fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries. To this end, the two parties will take the two declarations adopted by the Moscow Conference of Communist and Workers' Parties as their guide.

The two parties declared that they will continuously fight against the ideological influence of the bourgeoisie, especially against revisionism. At the same time, they will also oppose dogmatism and sectarianism.

The statement finally talked about the relations between the two countries. The statement said that Romania and Poland will further strengthen their mutual assistance and cooperation in economic, cultural, and other fields in the future. Both sides believe that the development of relations between the two countries in all aspects will help develop the friendship between the people of the two countries, promote the unity of the socialist camp countries, and promote the cause of world peace.

On behalf of both parties, the statement was signed by Gomulka and Cyrankiewicz on the Polish side, and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Chivu Stoica on the Romanian side.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, May 15th: The Polish Party and Government delegation, headed by Gomulka and Cyrankiewicz, left Bucharest by plane this morning to return to Poland after a three-day visit to Romania.

The Romanian Workers' Party and government leaders Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej and Chivu Stoica, members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party, ministers of various government departments, as well as representatives from all walks of life in the Romanian capital and tens of thousands of people, saw the delegation off at the airport.
