Relying on the Masses Can Accelerate Industrialization
Song Bingyin, First Secretary of the Rongfeng County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Yunnan Province

In a county that originally had no industry, should we simply rely on and wait for the state's large-scale investment and modern technology and equipment to establish local industry? Or should we fully rely on the masses, utilize the broad masses of peasants' urgent demands and enthusiasm for industrialization, combine workers and peasants, start from scratch, grow from small to large, transition from indigenous methods and manual operations to modernization, and gradually develop local industry? From the practice of Rongfeng County in developing local industry over the past two years, we have learned that the correct path is the latter, not the former.

The Impoverished Face Begins to Change

Rongfeng, formerly known as Xuanwei, is famous for producing the renowned Yunnan ham. However, the people's lives were very impoverished. Although there are coal, copper, iron and other mineral deposits throughout the county, it was once a famous copper-producing area during the Qing Dynasty. But in the past, indigenous smelting methods were used, forests were depleted, causing soil erosion. Not only could copper and iron not be smelted, but even the land became barren. The masses composed a folk song describing this situation:

　“Worry in drought, worry in rain, fields and land are washed away, becoming barren soil in three to five years, households are poor and people are thin, wearing hemp clothes patched with willow branches." The county had less than two mu of land per person, and three-tenths of a mu of cultivated land. After years of increased production, the average per capita grain output in 1956 was still less than 500 jin, and the average income was only 50 yuan, with some mountainous townships having only 15 yuan. Industry was even more backward. Before 1956, the entire county had only a small power plant for lighting and a rice mill, with an annual output value of just over 500,000 yuan. Iron ore was everywhere in the county, but the steel for making hoes and iron pots had to be brought in from other counties, and most of the means of production and livelihood relied on supplies from other places. In the past, although there had been talk for several years about establishing local industry, it had not been realized because people passively waited for higher authorities to provide funds, machines, and technicians. After agricultural cooperativization in 1956, a high tide of agricultural production was launched, and the supply of production tools suddenly became strained. Cooperatives needed a large number of new-style farm tools, but we were unable to even repair new-style farm tools, and even old-style farm tools could not meet the needs due to a lack of iron sources. How to solve this problem? The county Party committee launched a debate. Some comrades advocated that industry could only be established after higher authorities provided funds, machines, and technical personnel; other comrades advocated self-reliance and immediate action to solve the difficulties ourselves. After debate, we initially unified our thinking. With the specific assistance of the prefectural Party committee, we decided to start by solving the urgently needed raw materials for farm tools at that time. We organized a working group to visit farmers, discovered iron mines that had been mined in the past, found masters of indigenous iron smelting, and built a few small sheds. While mining, we sent farmers who knew indigenous iron smelting methods to study coke iron smelting in other places. With the enthusiastic support of the masses, a coke iron smelting furnace with a daily output of three tons was built in two months. This fact greatly encouraged the county Party committee's determination to rely on the masses to develop industry. In 1957, we vigorously organized local revenue, mobilized all departments to tighten their belts, save on operating expenses and administrative expenses, and raised 530,000 yuan in funds. We also established 19 new factories and mines, and produced new products such as bone meal, various new-style plows, horse-drawn carts, and threshing machines. The industrial output value increased from 500,000 yuan to more than 4 million yuan. We began to reverse the passive situation of insufficient supply of means of production, which directly promoted production. These factories and mines have played a significant role in this year's agricultural production high tide and tool reform movement. Now, 59 townships in the county have basically achieved vehicle transportation, there are more than 50 kilometers of iron and wood tracks, and 58,546 new-style farm tools have been promoted. It is expected that the rudimentary mechanization of transportation tools will be basically achieved in the first half of this year. In the locations of these factories and mines and in their vicinity, the role of local industry in increasing people's income and promoting agricultural development is particularly significant. For example, after Andi Township established an iron factory, sideline income increased from 5,400 yuan in 1956 to 39,000 yuan. Because the commune had accumulated funds, a medium-sized reservoir capable of irrigating more than 5,000 mu was built this year, a middle school was established, and telephone loudspeakers were installed. The peasants enthusiastically sang: "The moon comes out bright and clear, the Party's leadership is truly brilliant, the long-awaited hope has been realized, grateful for the Party's kindness."

After the rectification campaign and a year of practice in running local industry, our thinking has been liberated, and we have broken the mystique surrounding running industry. The general line for the construction period has pointed out a clear direction and task for us, and has also given us endless strength and encouragement. We immediately made a plan for industry to catch up with agriculture this year. After it was communicated, it immediately received the active support of district and township cadres and the masses, who led us to find mines and raw materials, helped us build roads, transport goods, and build factories, giving us whatever we needed and supporting us with whatever we lacked. Therefore, we dared to boldly envision striving to make the industrial output value catch up with the total agricultural output value this year, and plan to raise 5.07 million yuan through various means this year to build 237 new factories and mines. Currently, 129 have been put into production. It is expected that this year we will produce 30,000 tons of pig iron, 3,000 tons of steel ingots, 120,000 tons of coke, 1,000 tons of synthetic petroleum, 500 tons of crude copper, 1,000 tons of crude lead, 10,000 tons of superphosphate, 5,000 tons of artificial cotton, 1,800 tons of ham and cured meat, 3,000 double-wheel double-furrow plows, and 100,000 other farm tools. The output value of local industry will reach 35 million yuan. Under the leadership of state-owned factories and mines, cooperatives have established small factories and mines such as repair and manufacturing farm tool factories, granular fertilizer plants, and small iron smelting plants, totaling 1,522, launching a mass high tide of running industry at the same time as the agricultural production high tide. The facts vividly prove that the vast masses of peasants' demands for industrialization are very urgent and enthusiastically supportive. Once the call of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is grasped by the masses, it will generate tremendous power. This is the fundamental reason why our county's local industry can leap forward this year. And implementing the combination of workers and peasants, and reflecting the flesh-and-blood relationship between factories and farmers in all aspects, is the key to fully applying and developing the enthusiasm and strength of the peasants. This is of great significance for consolidating the foundation of the worker-peasant alliance. After a year of exploration, our methods and initial experience in this regard are:

Half-Worker, Half-Peasant, Half-Study, Half-Commerce

First, adopting the "three-halves" method, that is, half-worker, half-peasant, half-study, and half-commerce, is the main way to solve the labor force problem and is also the basis for the combination of workers and peasants. Most of the small factories and mines in our county are operated manually, requiring a large amount of labor. If all of them are hired by the state, not only will the investment required for wages and dormitories be impossible to solve, but it will also affect agricultural production. Our solution is: the state only hires a small number of workers who master power, machine repair, smelting, and require more technology, while a large number of ordinary labor and simple technical labor are uniformly allocated through contracts signed with cooperatives. The specific methods are:

1. For mines and raw materials that can be mined and collected in a decentralized manner, the factory and mine sign contracts with the cooperative according to quality, quantity, and time, and the cooperative arranges the labor force according to its own agricultural work situation, doing a lot in slack seasons, a little in less busy seasons, and nothing in busy seasons. In this way, the needs of the factory and mine are guaranteed without delaying production. The remuneration is regarded as sideline income and distributed uniformly.

2. For tasks that need to be carried out centrally, such as basic construction, mining concentrated shafts, and seasonal agricultural product processing, the agricultural cooperative draws 5% of the labor force from the team engaged in sideline production and regularly dispatches a portion of the labor force to the factory and mine to work as temporary workers. 70% to 80% of the income is turned over to the commune to be evaluated as work points, and 20% to 30% is used as a subsidy for the commune members. If the Andi Iron Plant, with a daily output of three tons, were to use all fixed workers, it would need more than 300 people, but by adopting the above two methods, it only used three cadres, four technicians, and ten semi-fixed workers.

3. Some light and simple labor should be used as much as possible by the agricultural cooperative's semi-labor force, the disabled, and surplus small vendors in the towns. For example, this year, two native and miscellaneous processing plants were established in the towns, processing casings, turpentine, medicinal materials, and palm ropes. Among the 80 workers, except for five with technical skills, all are semi-labor force and five-guarantee households from agricultural cooperatives and street residents. These two factories were prepared in February and put into production on March 1. The investment was only 500 yuan, the output value in March was 27,000 yuan, and the profit was 3,200 yuan. The mines use blind people to pull bellows and cripples to knock ore. There are more than 500 blind and crippled people in the county. The state and cooperatives need to provide relief and care for more than 20,000 yuan each year. After the great development of local industry, they can all change from five-guarantee to self-sufficiency. Not only do they not need care, but they can also create wealth for the country. They reflected: "The lame are not lame, the blind are not blind, they used to be five-guarantee, now we also want to contribute to the great leap forward."

4. Some temporary and light labor is combined with the school's work-study program, using holidays and rest time to carry out, which not only enables students to get exercise but also increases income.

5. For the processing of scattered mountain specialties and wild plants, we adopt the "one person, one horse, one pot" method, training purchasing personnel, taking tools up the mountain, and using the mountain area's raw materials and labor to process them on the spot.

If all fixed workers were used for local industry in our county this year, more than 20,000 people would be needed. Thanks to the above measures, only more than 270 technical workers and more than 1,000 semi-fixed workers were used.

With the Combination of Workers and Peasants, We Fear No Difficulties

Second, the combination of workers and peasants smoothly solved the difficulties in funds, resources, and technology. In practice, we have gradually realized that the combination of workers and peasants can not only solve the labor force problem required for running industry, but more importantly, after a large number of the agricultural cooperative's labor force participate in industrial production, it increases the income of the agricultural cooperative, makes the factory and mine's production more adaptable to the needs of the countryside, and in terms of emotion, both the cooperative and the peasants feel that the workers are their own commune members and relatives, and are particularly close. All of this makes the peasants love the factory and mine even more and are willing to do everything possible to support the factory and mine. Many small factories and mines lack the funds for basic construction and purchasing raw materials, so they sign contracts with agricultural cooperatives, with the cooperative supplying raw materials and construction workers, temporarily recording the accounts, and paying them when the factory has income, and then the cooperative distributes the money. Some agricultural cooperatives also lend their surplus money to the factory as working capital. When both the factory and the cooperative are short of money, the credit cooperative mobilizes scattered funds to solve the problem. For example, in May 1957, the Andi Iron Plant owed money to the agricultural cooperative, which could not be repaid for a while, affecting the cooperative's distribution. The credit cooperative mobilized the masses to deposit 1,100 yuan and lent it to the iron plant, which paid it back to the cooperative, thus ensuring that the commune could distribute the money in a timely manner. In August, when the agricultural cooperative wanted to buy oxen and farm tools, the iron plant actively promoted the sale of its products and concentrated more than 3,000 yuan of funds through worker savings and other methods, and lent it to the cooperative.

In terms of technical strength, because everyone loves industry, talents are recommended everywhere. The county has discovered 237 various technical workers from government agencies, schools, rural areas, and handicraft workers. In addition, by taking apprentices, asking people to teach each other, sending people to study, and mobilizing workers to offer suggestions, the current needs have been initially resolved.

The masses also actively report mines, helping us find more than a dozen kinds of minerals and more than 370 kinds of wild plants, opening up a wide range of raw material resources. Currently, using more than a dozen kinds of wild plants to brew wine and artificial cotton has been successfully manufactured.

The Whole Party Runs Industry, Everyone Gets Involved

Third, the whole Party takes action, and various departments are organized to cooperate.

After this year's great leap forward in industry and agriculture, in order to implement the policy of the whole Party running industry and the whole people running industry, and to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses, it is necessary to strengthen Party leadership and coordination and balance. We mainly strengthen from two aspects: the county and district Party committees and branches all have a secretary or member who specializes in industry, and the cooperative is linked to the factory by a deputy director or member in charge of sideline production. The Party committee regularly studies the coordination and cooperation of industrial and agricultural production, road construction, transportation, and commerce. On the other hand, we organize the forces of various departments (mainly industrial and commercial and financial departments) to actively run industry. For example, the supply and marketing cooperative runs various native and special product processing plants, the service bureau runs a canning factory, and the commerce bureau runs a textile factory and a small hardware processing plant, and they provide funds to transfer cadres and are responsible for organizing long-distance supply and sales. When the various departments are combined, many blind spots and mutually offsetting forces and mutual buck-passing phenomena can be reduced. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses can be better brought into play, and the county Party committee can also adhere to taking agriculture as the main focus while not relaxing industry, basically achieving grasping both agriculture and industry with both hands, so that industry and agriculture can leap forward at the same time.

Recalling the development of local industry in our county, I once again feel the greatness of the Party's mass line, and I also firmly believe that as long as we resolutely rely on the masses and the whole Party runs industry, we will inevitably accelerate industrialization and accelerate the shortening of the boundaries between workers and peasants and between urban and rural areas.

We have the confidence to leap forward again on the basis of this year's leap forward, and strive to make Rongfeng a modern industrial city in five or three years, and achieve mechanized and electrified farming throughout the county, so that the backward face of our county can be fundamentally changed.

　　依靠群众就能加速工业化
　　中共云南省榕峰县委第一书记　宋丙寅
    在原来没有任何工业的县里，是单纯依靠和等待国家的大量投资和现代的技术装备来办地方工业呢？还是充分依靠群众，运用广大农民对工业化的迫切要求和热情，工农结合，从无到有，从小到大，从土办法和手工操作到现代化，逐步发展地方工业呢？从榕峰县两年来发展地方工业的实践中，我们体会到正确的道路是后者而不是前者。
    贫困的面貌开始改变
    榕峰原名宣威，是出产著名的云南火腿的地方。然而人民生活却很贫困。虽然这里有遍布全县的煤、铜、铁等矿藏，清朝时候曾是著名的产铜区。但过去用土法冶炼，森林砍伐殆尽，造成水土流失，不仅铜铁炼不成，连田地也搞瘦了，群众将这样情况编成歌谣：
  “天旱愁，下雨愁，冲田冲地，三年五年变为地骨头，户穷人瘦，麻布衣裳筋筋柳”。全县每人不到二亩地，三分田，经过连年增产，直到1956年每人平均原粮还不到五百斤，平均收入只有五十元，有的山区乡只有十五元。工业更为落后，1956年前全县只有一个供照明用的小型发电厂和一个碾米厂，年产值仅五十多万元。本县到处是铁矿，但打锄头用的钢和铁锅要从外县调来，生产生活资料大部分依靠外地供应。过去虽然叫了几年要办地方工业，但由于只消极地想上级给资金、机器和技术员，所以一直没办起来。1956年农业合作化以后，掀起了农业生产高潮，生产工具的供应骤然紧张起来。合作社需要大量的新式农具，但我们连新式农具的修理也无能为力，就是连旧式农具也因为缺铁没有货源而无法满足需要。如何解决这个问题呢？县委展开了争论。有的同志主张要等上级给资金给机器和技术人员才能办工业；有的同志主张自力更生，立即动手，自己解决困难。经过辩论后，初步统一了思想，在地委的具体帮助下，决定先从解决当时迫切需要的农具原料入手，组织工作组访问农民，发现过去开过的铁矿，找到了土法炼铁的师傅，搭了几间小棚子，一面开采，一面派出会搞土法炼铁的农民，到外地学习焦炭炼铁。在群众热情的支持下，两个月就建成了日产三吨的一座焦炭炼铁炉。这个事实大大鼓舞了县委依靠群众办工业的决心。1957年我们大力组织地方经费的收入，动员各部门节衣缩食，节约事业费和行政经费，筹措了五十三万元的资金，又新办了十九个厂矿，制成了骨粉、各种新式步犁、马车、打谷机等新产品，工业产值由五十万元增加到四百多万元。开始扭转了生产资料供应不足的被动局面，直接推动了生产。在今年的农业生产高潮和工具改革运动中，这些厂矿发挥了很大的作用。现在全县已有五十九个乡，基本实现了车子化，铁木轨道已有五十多公里，新式农具推广了五万八千五百四十六件，并可在今年上半年内，基本实现在运输工具上的土机械化。在这些厂矿所在地及其附近，地方工业对于增加人民收入和促进农业发展的作用，尤为显著。如安迪乡办了铁工厂后，副业收入就由1956年的五千四百元增到三万九千元，由于社里有了积累，今年修了一个能灌溉五千多亩的中型水库，办了一所中学，并安了电话喇叭筒。农民在热情地歌唱着：“月亮出来月亮清，党的领导真英明，千日盼头实现了，积极劳动感恩情”。
    经过了整风运动和一年办地方工业的实践，使我们思想得到解放，打破了办工业的神秘观点。建设时期总路线，又给我们指出了明确的方向和任务，也给了我们无穷的力量和鼓舞。我们当即作了今年工业赶上农业的规划，传达后，立即获得区、乡干部和群众的积极支持，带领找矿、找原料，帮助修路、运输、建厂，要什么给什么，缺什么支援什么。因此，我们就敢于大胆设想争取今年使工业产值赶上农业总产值，计划今年内要想各种办法筹集五百零七万元资金，新建二百三十七个厂矿。目前已有一百二十九个投入生产，预计今年将生产生铁三万吨，钢锭三千吨，焦炭十二万吨，人造石油一千吨，粗铜五百吨，粗铅一千吨，过磷酸钙一万吨，人造棉五千吨，火腿腊肉一千八百吨，双轮双铧犁三千部及其他农具十万件。地方工业产值将达到三千五百万元。在国营厂矿的带动下，合作社已办起修理和制造农具厂、颗粒肥料、小炼铁厂等小型厂矿共计一千五百二十二个，在农业生产高潮的同时，掀起了一个群众性的办工业的高潮。事实生动地证明了广大农民对工业化的要求是十分迫切的和热情支持的。党中央和毛主席的号召一为群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的威力，这是我县今年的地方工业能够跃进的根本原因。而实行工农结合，从各方面体现工厂与农民的血肉关系，则是充分应用与发扬农民的这种热情和力量的关键。这对于巩固工农联盟的基础，具有重要意义。经过一年来的摸索，我们在这方面的办法和初步经验是：
    半工半农，半工半学，半工半商
    第一、采取“三半”的办法，即半工半农，半工半学，半工半商的办法，是解决劳动力的主要出路，也是工农结合的基础。我县办的小厂矿多系手工操作，需要的劳动力很多，如全部由国家雇用，不仅工资和宿舍所需的投资无法解决，也会影响农业生产。我们解决的办法是：国家只雇用少数掌握动力、机修、冶炼及需要较多技术的工人，大量的普通劳动和简单技术劳动则和合作社订立合同统一调配。具体办法是：
    一、可以分散挖的矿和原料搜集，由厂矿和合作社按质、按量、按时订立合同，合作社根据自己的农活情况来安排劳动力，农闲大搞，小忙小搞，大忙不搞。这样，既保证了厂矿的需要，又不耽误生产。报酬作为副业收入，统一分配。
    二、需要集中进行的活计，如基本建设、开采较集中的矿井、季节性的农产品加工等，则由农业社从搞副业的队伍中抽调5％的劳动力，经常轮派一部分劳动力到厂矿做临时工，收入提70％到80％交社评给工分，20％至30％作为社员的补贴。日产三吨的安迪炼铁厂如全用固定工，需要三百多人，但采取以上两种办法，只用了三个干部、四个技工和十个半固定工。
    三、有些轻微劳动和简单劳动，尽量利用农业社的半劳动力和残废及城镇多余小商贩去做。如今年城镇办了两个土杂加工厂，加工肠衣、松节油、药材、棕绳，八十个工人中，除去五个有技术的外，都是农业社和街道居民中的半劳力和五保户。这两个厂2月中筹建，3月1日投入生产，投资仅五百元，3月份产值二万七千元，利润三千二百元。矿山则用瞎子扯风箱，跛子敲矿石。全县瞎子跛子有五百多人，每年国家及合作社需救济照顾二万多元，地方工业大发展后，他们都可从五保变成自保，不仅不要照顾，还可为国家创造财富。他们反映：“跛的不跛，瞎的不瞎，过去是五保，现在我们也要为大跃进献个宝”。
    四、一些临时性的而又较轻微的劳动，则和学校的勤工俭学相结合，利用假日及休息时间进行，既使学生得到锻炼，又增加收入。
    五、分散的山区土特产及野生植物加工，则采取“一人一马一锅”的办法，训练采购人员，带工具上山，就地利用山区的原料和劳动力进行加工。
    今年我县地方工业如全用固定工人，就需二万多人，由于采取上述办法，只用了技术工人二百七十多人及半固定工人一千多人。
    工农结合，什么困难都不怕
    第二、工农结合顺利地解决了资金、资源、技术上的困难。在实践中，我们逐步体会到工农结合不仅可以解决办工业所需要的劳动力问题，更重要的是农业社的大批劳动力参加工业生产之后，增加了农业社的收入，使厂矿的生产更能适应农村的要求，在感情上社和农民都感到工人是自己的社员亲属，分外的亲切。所有这些，都使农民更加热爱厂矿，愿意尽一切力量来支持厂矿。许多小厂矿缺乏基本建设和购进原料的资金，便和农业社订立合同，由社供应原料和建筑工人，暂时记账，等工厂有了收入，合作社分配的时候再付给。有的农业社还把自己多余的钱借给工厂作流动资金。在厂社都缺钱的时候，便由信用社动员零散资金解决。如安迪铁厂1957年5月欠农业社的账，一时不能偿还，影响合作社分配，信用社便动员群众存款一千一百元贷给铁厂，还给合作社，这样便保证了社能够及时分配。8月农业社要买耕牛农具，铁厂又积极推销产品及用工人储蓄等办法集中了三千多元资金，贷给合作社。
    在技术力量方面，由于大家热爱工业，到处举荐人材。全县从机关学校农村及手工业工人中发掘出各种技术工二百三十七人，再加上带徒弟、互相请人传授、派人学习、及发动工人献计等办法，初步解决了目前的需要。
    群众还积极报矿，帮助我们找到了十几种矿产和三百七十多种野生植物，开辟了广阔的原料资源。目前用十几种野生植物酿酒和人造棉已制造成功。
    全党办工业，大家齐动手
    第三、全党动手，组织各部协同配合。
    今年工农业大跃进之后，为了贯彻执行全党办工业全民办工业的方针，充分发挥群众的积极性，必须加强党的领导和协作平衡。我们主要是从两方面加强：县区委和支部都有一个书记或委员专管工业，合作社由管副业生产的副主任或委员和厂挂钩，党委定期研究工农业生产和修路运输及商业的互相配合与协作。另一方面组织各个部门（主要是工商财政部门）的力量，积极办工业。如供销社办各种土特产加工厂，服务局办罐头厂，商业局办纺织厂和小五金加工厂，并由他们出资金调干部，负责组织远距离的供销。条条块块结合起来，就可减少许多盲目性和互相抵销力量、互相扯皮的现象。这样就更好的发挥了群众的积极性，县委也得以坚持了以农业为主同时又不放松工业，基本上做到了一手抓农业一手抓工业，使工农业同时跃进。
    回忆我县地方工业发展的情况，使我再一次感到党的群众路线的伟大，也使我坚信，只要坚决依靠群众，全党办工业，就必然加速工业化，加速缩短工农界限和城乡界限。
    我们有信心在今年跃进的基础上再跃进，力争五年或三年内使榕峰成为一个工业城市，并在全县实现耕作机械化、电气化，使我县落后面貌从根本改变。
