Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: The capital's theatrical circles, in the midst of the Great Leap Forward, have broken through the shackles of various conventions, their minds have been liberated, and they have bravely innovated, undertaking many bold attempts that were previously unthinkable. In recent months, a large number of excellent plays with new content and new forms have emerged, presenting a new face of a hundred flowers blooming. Among these diverse new plays, dramas reflecting modern life have converged into the mainstream, and historical dramas are also presented to the audience in a new posture.

At present, the capital's spoken dramas and operas are exceptionally active in reflecting real life and struggles, and are making further efforts in inheriting and developing the traditions of national drama. The spoken drama "Red Storm" performed by the China Youth Art Theater and "February 7th Storm" performed by the China Railway Art Troupe rival each other, vividly depicting the struggle of the "February 7th" general strike. The stage setting of "Red Storm" draws on traditional national forms, designing the magnificent scenery to be simple, beautiful and imposing, which not only conforms to the principle of more, faster, better and more economical results, but also facilitates mobile performances. This theater plans to stage historical dramas such as "The Death of Li Xiucheng" soon, and will also adapt the novel "Red Flag Story," bringing the story of the Chinese peasant revolutionary struggle of the past few decades to the stage. The "Two Red Army Women," which will be staged soon by the General Political Department Cultural Troupe of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, boldly uses traditional national performance forms and uses the technique of appearing ghosts to strengthen the flashback scenes, which has aroused various opinions and debates.

After the Beijing People's Art Theater performed "Teahouse," in which Lao She used an original technique to describe the changes of three eras, it will soon stage "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," adapted from the wonderful part of the novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest." To commemorate Guan Hanqing, a world cultural celebrity this year, the play "Guan Hanqing," which will be performed by this theater, was written by the playwright Tian Han in one month during the Great Leap Forward. Some people in the capital's drama circles believe that this excellent script has broken through Tian Han's original creative level, successfully portraying Guan Hanqing's righteous and courageous temperament from the perspective of historical materialism, and the artistic expression form is more distinctive with national characteristics. Tian Han is currently adapting the Peking Opera "Romance of the West Chamber," and he is working hard to complete his plan to write ten scripts this year. The playwright Yang Hansheng, who has been away from creation for many years, recently created the script "Three People Walking," which describes the transformation of intellectuals, and will be performed by the Central Academy of Drama Experimental Drama Troupe. The performance of one-act satirical plays such as "American Anecdotes," collectively created by playwright Chen Baichen and cartoonists Mi Gu and Jiang Yousheng, powerfully attracts the audience. Large-scale operas such as "Liu Jiemei", "Chiye River", "Returning Home in Glory" and "The Legend of the White Snake," which have recently been rehearsed by the Central Experimental Opera House, will soon be toured in Northeast, Northwest, Southwest and East China.

The use of traditional national opera art to reflect modern life, this new attempt, has aroused the attention and discussion of the drama circles on the issue of inheritance and innovation of national drama art. The successful performance of "The White Haired Girl" by the China Peking Opera Theater has been unanimously praised by the audience, creating a way for opera art to perform modern life. "Red Satellite Raises Havoc in the Heavenly Palace" made a socialist romantic attempt, cleverly combining the world-shaking current affairs and the story of the Chinese folk mythology Chang'e, and carrying out current affairs propaganda in an interesting way. The Beijing Peking Opera Troupe and the Beijing Pingju Opera Troupe have recently staged the new play "Wise Capture of the Bandit Lord Zuo Shandiao" adapted from the novel "Tracks in the Snowy Forest," one after another. The emerging Peking Opera Troupe plans to stage the new serial play "New Children's Heroes" in May. After performing "For the Red", "Sanliwan" and "Liu Jiemei", the China Pingju Opera House also plans to adapt the novel "Han Meimei", which describes high school graduates participating in agricultural production, and new plays that express thrift and housekeeping. When they recently toured around Baoding, they also created the short and lively "Four Sisters Praising Husbands" which combines the current movement, vividly expressing the revolutionary enthusiasm of workers, peasants, soldiers and cadres who have been sent to lower levels, and are deeply loved by the masses.

The opera art, which is good at expressing historical stories, is making greater efforts in performing historical dramas. In order to commemorate Guan Hanqing, a great Chinese playwright, the China Peking Opera Theater successfully adapted Guan's plays "Five Marquis Banquet" and "Wise Execution of Lu Zhai Lang", and will successively rehearse many new plays such as "Tianbo Tower" and "Golden Bell Records". Lao She's new work "Generals of the Yang Family" will be performed by Tan Fuying and others, and Ma Lianliang and others will also rehearse the new play "Big Red Robe".

The emergence of a large number of novel and original plays has aroused strong reactions in literary and art circles and among the masses; some are praised by everyone, some have aroused heated debates, some have remained silent, with both praise and criticism.

Recently, the arrival of the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe has alarmed the capital's theater world. This new force has impacted and enlightened the capital's drama circles. The capital's cultural and drama departments attach great importance to the small, diverse performance forms they have created that can go deep into workshops, fields, and streets to cooperate with production and political movements anytime and anywhere. They expressed that they will learn from the advanced pioneering work of the Hangzhou Yue Opera Troupe to make drama art more closely linked to the masses and serve socialist construction more directly.

    大胆尝试　勇敢革新
    首都上演剧目有如百花争艳
    新华社3日讯　大跃进中的首都戏剧界，突破了各种陈规的束缚，思想得到解放，勇敢革新，进行了许多过去所不敢作的大胆尝试，近几个月来已涌现出大量具有新内容、新形式的优秀剧目，呈现了百花齐放的新面貌。在这些风格多样的新剧目中，反映现代生活的戏剧汇成了主流，历史剧也以新的姿态呈现在观众面前。
    目前首都的话剧和歌剧正在异常活跃地反映着现实生活和斗争，并在继承发扬民族戏剧传统方面作着进一步的努力。中国青年艺术剧院演出的话剧“红色风暴”和中国铁路文工团演出的“二七风暴”互相媲美，生动地表现了“二七”大罢工的斗争。“红色风暴”的舞台设置吸取了传统的民族形式，把富丽堂皇的布景，设计得简单美观而有气魄，既符合多快好省的原则，又便于流动演出。这个剧院计划不久上演“李秀成之死”等历史剧，还将改编上演小说“红旗谱”，把近几十年来中国农民革命斗争的故事搬上舞台。中国人民解放军总政治部文工团即将上演的“两个女红军”，大胆地运用了传统的民族表演形式，用出现亡魂的手法来加强回忆的场景，引起了各种不同意见的争论。
    北京人民艺术剧院在演出老舍以独创手法描写三个时代变化的“茶馆”之后，即将上演小说“林海雪原”的精采部分改编的“智取威虎山”。这个剧院为纪念今年的世界文化名人关汉卿，即将演出的“关汉卿”一剧，是剧作家田汉在大跃进中用一个月时间写成的。首都一些戏剧界人士认为，这个优秀剧本突破了田汉原有的创作水平，以历史唯物主义观点成功地刻划了关汉卿正义勇敢的气质，艺术表现形式更具有浓厚的民族特色。田汉目前又在改编京剧“西厢记”，他努力在完成着今年编写十个剧本的计划。脱离创作多年的剧作家阳翰笙最近创作的描写知识分子改造的剧本“三人行”，将由中央戏剧学院实验话剧团演出。剧作家陈白尘和漫画家米谷、江有声集体创作的“美国奇谈”等独幕讽刺剧的上演，有力地吸引着观众。中央实验歌剧院新近排演的“刘介梅”、“赤叶河”、“衣锦荣归”、“白蛇传”等大型歌剧即将到东北、西北、西南、华东各地巡回演出。
    用民族传统的戏曲艺术，来反映现代生活，这一新的尝试，使戏剧界对民族戏剧艺术的继承与革新问题，引起了重视和讨论。中国京剧院成功的演出了“白毛女”，受到观众一致的称赞，开创了戏曲艺术表演现代生活的途径。“红色卫星闹天宫”做了社会主义浪漫主义的尝试，把震动世界的时事和中国民间神话嫦娥的故事巧妙地结合起来，富有情趣地进行了时事宣传。北京京剧团和北京市评剧团最近正在先后上演根据小说“林海雪原”改编的新戏“智擒惯匪坐山雕”，新兴京剧团计划在5月份上演新连台本戏“新儿女英雄传”。中国评剧院在演出“为了红”、“三里湾”、“刘介梅”之后，还计划改编描写高小毕业生参加农业生产的小说“韩梅梅”和表现勤俭持家的新剧目。他们最近在保定一带巡回演出时还创作了短小活泼结合当前运动的“四姐妹夸夫”，通俗生动的表现了工、农、兵和下放干部的革命干劲，深受群众喜爱。
    擅长表现历史故事的戏曲艺术，在表演历史剧方面做着更大的努力，为了纪念我国伟大戏剧家关汉卿，中国京剧院成功地改编了关氏剧作“五侯宴”、“智斩鲁斋郎”，并将陆续排演“天波楼”、“金铃记”等许多新剧目。老舍的新作“杨家将”将由谭富英等演出，马连良等也要排演新剧目“大红袍”。
    大量新颖独创剧目的出现，在文艺界和群众中引起了强烈的反映；有的众口称赞，有的引起热烈争论，有的尚保持着沉默，有表扬也有批评。
    最近，杭州越剧团的到来，惊动了首都的剧坛，这支新生力量冲激和启发着首都的戏剧界，首都的文化、戏剧部门极为重视他们所创造的小型多样能够深入车间、田间、街头随时随地配合生产和政治运动的演出形式，表示要学习杭州越剧团的先进创举，使戏剧艺术更加密切联系群众，更直接地为社会主义建设服务。
