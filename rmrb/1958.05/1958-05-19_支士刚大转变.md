Zhi Shigang's Great Transformation
	Li Ximing, Secretary of the Party Committee of Shijingshan Power Plant

	The China Youth Daily published an article entitled "Save Zhi Shigang" on October 10th of last year. It criticized Zhi Shigang's erroneous thinking. Half a year has passed, and Zhi Shigang has undergone a great change in this new situation. At our plant's summary meeting for the double-anti movement, Zhi Shigang was commended as a model of ideological work's double leap forward.

	As a comrade who works with Zhi Shigang, I would like to introduce to my comrades Zhi Shigang's great ideological leap forward and great work leap forward.

	Since Zhi Shigang posted a big-character poster entitled "Save Me, Leaders" during our plant's rectification campaign and great blooming last year, expressing erroneous opinions on wages, labor, and work, he has been refuted and criticized by many workers. This caused a fierce struggle in his thinking.

	He thought:
	--The Party called on everyone to raise their opinions, so why is everyone criticizing me?
	--I've been sick for nearly six years. Some of my buddies who came to work at the factory with me have become shift engineers, and some have graduated from university. At the very least, they've become very good technicians. But the leaders assigned me to do odd jobs. How is this reasonable?
	--Why are the old workers who do odd jobs with me paid more than me?
	--I only knew that the Party and the state cured my illness, but I didn't know that the leaders spent more than 10,000 yuan on me! ...

	Just as he was distressed, countless hands of assistance were extended to him. The comrades who worked with him patiently helped him analyze his thoughts. Gradually, his thinking changed. He thought, "So much money was spent on treating my illness in hospitals and sanatoriums for six years. If it weren't for the Communist Party, wouldn't I have died long ago? Why am I still asking the leaders to save me?" If the work is not satisfactory, so be it! So, he wrote a big-character poster to make a self-criticism and settled down to work. In the past, he was unhappy when someone asked him to take a shift at the gate as a guard when they took leave. This time, when he saw that there were people missing at the gate, he took the initiative to ask to be on duty, and the comrades came to encourage him.

	Immediately afterwards, the streamlining of institutions and the sending down of cadres began. Some cadres went to the countryside, and some went to do heavy physical labor such as transporting coal and removing ash. At this time, Zhi Shigang thought, "These people have both culture and technology, but why are they so happy to do whatever they are told?" He vaguely began to feel the great power of socialism, and at the same time, he asked himself, "You Zhi Shigang have neither culture nor technology, what reason do you have to pick and choose your work?" "What have you contributed to socialism?" He felt a little ashamed.

	Just as it was said in the Soviet novel "Harvest," "Our society is like an unsinkable lake. Even if someone accidentally falls to the bottom of the lake, they will not drown, but will be able to float up." Not only the comrades in this factory were so enthusiastic in helping Zhi Shigang to recognize his mistakes, but throughout our country, there are hands of assistance and sincere hearts everywhere. Since the China Youth Daily published the article criticizing Zhi Shigang, he has received many letters from all over the country. They enthusiastically criticized and criticized Zhi Shigang's mistakes, pointed out his future, and hoped that he would find the correct direction. For example, a letter from Zhi Chaoyang, Yunnan Zhaotong: "Shigang – Family Brother, hello!

	How could I, thousands of miles away, know you and write to you? This is because I saw the article 'Save Zhi Shigang' in the China Youth Daily, and we have the same surname; but first of all, I want to state: I am not just greeting someone with the same surname, nor am I supporting your bad ideas, but as the newspaper said, I want to 'save you.' … I don't understand why you would utter the cry that only a victim could make? Your mother told reporters about your family's painful experiences before liberation, which was so painful! It was simply worse than being a cow or a horse! And your old and frail father was tortured to death after working all his life! But what about after liberation? You lived in a hospital and sanatorium for six years, and the state spent 18,000 yuan to save you from death. So what else do you want to be saved from? You shouldn't be ungrateful! Looking back at my family, the only small piece of land my family had before liberation was also taken away by the landlord. My parents relied on doing odd jobs for others, and at the end of the year, there was not a single grain of food in the house. What was my home like? There were only four walls, and we asked people for some corn stalks to put on the top. We don't know how many years we lived like this! I also endured six or seven years from the time I remember things. But it always came to an end. In 1949, our savior – the Communist Party – came, and from then on, we saw sunny days. Soon, land reform distributed land, and a new life began. I also entered school. In 1953, I went to junior high school. For three years, I received special care from the state – first-class scholarship; in 1956, I went to high school again. In the past, I never dreamed that I would go to high school! This is all brought to us by the Party, Chairman Mao, and the new society! … Family brother, turn back! Your thoughts are all wrong. The only thing you should do is to work hard and contribute our strength to socialism..."

	After Zhi Shigang received these letters, he read them again and again. He thought: These people don't know me, and they are thousands of miles away, why did they write to me? What are they plotting? … Gradually, he felt that this is the new society, everyone cares about everyone, there are friends everywhere, there are comrades everywhere, how lovely this society is! … Everyone says I'm wrong, I'm really wrong … He repeatedly recalled the big-character posters he wrote, and he carefully examined his thoughts … "Yes, in our country, it is glorious to do any work, as long as you do it wholeheartedly. As for wages, the old workers only have a few more yuan than me, but how many years have they worked! Why should I compare with them? If you really want to haggle about money, then I will never be able to pay back the money the country spent on treating my illness in my lifetime! Now that I have resumed work and my sister has become a worker, there is no problem with life, so what else do I want?" … In addition, the great scene of the country's galloping progress of ten thousand horses a day during this period made Zhi Shigang feel even more that "individualism is too shameful, only when the country is good will everyone be good. Take myself as an example, didn't the new society save me from death? Yes! I must work hard!" – This is the conclusion of Zhi Shigang's ideological struggle.

	Zhi Shigang has become another person. He enthusiastically does guard and communication work. He comes early and leaves late. He doesn't want to leave even if he's not told to leave. He works the day shift, and when the front and back night shifts are handed over, he is afraid that the people checking entry and exit permits are too busy, so he helps. The workers said: Zhi Shigang, how many hours do you work a day! How come you are at the gate when you go to work in the morning, you are still there when you get off work at noon, you see you again when you enter the factory at night, and you see you again when you come out in the middle of the night! He also takes on the work of collecting and distributing bicycle license plates. After he gets off work at the South Gate, he sometimes goes to help at the North Gate. If there is a problem with the gate of the cinder channel, he also goes to help. After he gets off the late night shift, he follows everyone to play mahjong, dig pupae, plant trees... he does everything.

	The trade union was re-elected, and everyone unanimously agreed to elect Zhi Shigang as the group leader, which further prompted him to work hard. In addition to doing specific work, he also does ideological work. When it came to the quarterly awards, everyone unanimously agreed to give Zhi Shigang a first prize. At the end of April, during the plant-wide leap forward competition, Zhi Shigang's team was rated as an advanced team and won a certificate. At the plant-wide summary meeting, Zhi Shigang was commended as a model of ideological and work double leap forward.

### 支士刚大转变

　　支士刚大转变
　　石景山发电厂党委书记　李锡铭
    去年10月10日的中国青年报上刊登了一篇题为“救救支士刚”的文章。批评支士刚的错误思想。事过半年，支士刚在这新的形势下发生了大变化。在我们全厂双反运动总结大会上，支士刚做为思想工作双跃进的典型受到了表扬。
    做为和支士刚一起工作的同志，我愿意把支士刚思想大跃进、工作大跃进的情况向同志们介绍。
    自从去年我厂整风大鸣大放中支士刚以“救我一救吧——领导”为题张贴了大字报，对工资、劳动、工作各方面发表了错误言论以后，他遭到了很多职工的反驳和批判。在他的思想上引起激烈的斗争。
    他想：
    ——党号召大家有意见就提，为什么大家又批判我呢？
    ——病了将近六年多，和我一起到工厂工作的小伙伴有的已经当了值班工程师，有的已大学毕业，起码的也成了很不错的技工了，而领导却把我分配做勤杂工作，这怎么算合理呢？
    ——为什么和我一起做勤杂工作的老工人也都比我工资高呢？
    ——我只知道党和国家给我养好了病，但我并不知道领导上竟给我花了一万多元呀！……
    正在他苦恼的时候，周围伸出了无数的援助的手。和他一起工作的同志们都来耐心帮助他分析思想。慢慢地他的思想起了变化，他想：“花了那么多钱，六年来住医院、疗养院把病医好了，要不是共产党我不是早就死掉了吗？我还叫领导救我什么呢？”工作不如意再说吧！于是，写了一张大字报做了检讨，安下心来工作了。过去有人请假叫他去到大门上替班做守卫工作他不满意，这次他看到大门上缺人就主动要求去值班，同志们看到了都来鼓励他。
    紧接着，精简机构干部下放开始了，有的干部到农村，有的干部去做运煤除灰等繁重的体力劳动。这时支士刚想“这些人是又有文化、又有技术，可是他们为什么这样高高兴兴的叫干什么就干什么呢”？他开始模糊地感到社会主义的伟大力量，同时也反问自己“你支士刚既无文化又无技术有什么理由还要挑工作呢？”“你又为社会主义贡献了什么？”他感到自己有点惭愧。
    正像苏联小说“收获”中所曾说过的“我们的社会好像一个不沉的湖，即使有人失足掉进湖底，也不会淹死，而能够浮上来”。不只是本厂的同志们那样热心地来帮助支士刚认识错误，在我们的国家里到处是援助的手和赤诚的心。自从中国青年报上刊载了批评支士刚的文章以后，全国各地给支士刚来了不少的信，他们热心地指责和批评支士刚的错误，指出他的前途，希望他找到正确的方向。例如从云南昭通来了署名支朝阳的一封信：“士刚——家门兄，您好！
    相隔万里的我，怎会知道您并且给您写信呢？这是因为在中国青年报上看到了‘救救支士刚’的文章，而我们又是同姓；但首先申明：我不只是问候同姓也不是支持您那种坏思想，而是像报上所说的要‘救救您’。……我不理解为什么您会发出受难者才能发出的呼声？您的母亲向记者叙述了您家在解放前沉痛的经历，那是多么痛苦啊！简直牛马不如啊！而您年老力衰的父亲做了一辈子工终究被折磨死了！而解放后呢？您住了六年医院疗养院，国家花了一万八千元才把您从死亡中救了出来，那么您还要救救您的什么呢？不该忘恩负义呀！再反过来看看我家，解放前我家仅有的一小块土地也被地主剥夺去了，我父母就是靠给人家帮零工，一年苦到头家里一颗粮食也没有，我的家是什么样呢？只是四个墙壁，向人家讨了点包谷秆搭在顶上，像这样的日子不知过了多少年啊！从我记事的时候也熬了六、七年。但是，总是熬到头了。1949年我们的救命恩人——共产党来了，从此我们见了晴天，不久土地改革分到了土地，新的生活开始了，我也进了学校，1953年我上了初中，三年都是得到了国家的特等照顾——甲等助学金；1956年我又上了高中，过去我做梦也没想过我会上高中呀！这都是党、毛主席、新社会给我们带来的啊！……家门兄，回心转意吧！您的想法全错了。您应该做的只有一条——就是努力工作，为了社会主义贡献我们的力量……”
    支士刚接到了这些信以后，看了又看，他想：这些人和我素不相识，迢迢万里，为什么给我来信呢？他们图什么呢？……慢慢地他感到了这就是新社会，谁都关心谁，到处是朋友，到处是同志，这个社会多么可爱呀！……大家都说我错了，我确实错了……他反复地回忆了他写的大字报，他认真地检查了他的思想……“是的，在我们的国家里做什么工作也是光荣的，只要尽心尽意地去做，至于工资，老工人比我才多几块钱，可是他们是干了多少年啊！我凭什么和他们比呢？真要计较钱的话，那么国家为我养病花的钱我一辈子也还不完啊！现在我恢复了工作，妹妹也当了工人，生活没有问题，还要怎么样呢？”……再加上这一段时期全国万马奔腾一日千里的伟大情景，使支士刚更感到了“个人主义太可耻了，只有国家好了每个人才会好啊。拿自己来说，还不是新社会把我从死亡中救出来了吗？是啊！我要努力地工作啊！”——这便是支士刚思想斗争的结论。
    支士刚变成了另外一个人了，他热心地做好守卫和传达工作。他早来晚走，不赶着叫他走都不肯走，上了白天班，到前后夜交接班时，他怕查出入证的人太忙还去帮忙。工人们说：支士刚你一天工作多少小时呀！怎么早晨上班时你在大门口，中午下班你还在，晚上进厂又看到你，半夜出来又看到你啊！他还担任收发自行车牌子的工作，在南大门下了班，有时还到北大门来帮忙，炉灰道大门有问题他也去帮忙，下了后夜班他又去跟着大家打麻雀、挖蛹、植树……什么都干。
    工会改选了，大家一致同意选支士刚当组长，这就更促使他努力工作。他除了做具体工作外，还做思想工作到一季评奖时，大家一致同意给支士刚评上一等奖。到4月底全厂跃进大评比时，支士刚的小组评上了先进组，得了奖状。在全厂总结大会上，支士刚当做思想和工作双跃进的典型受到了表扬。
