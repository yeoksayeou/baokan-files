    Now is the time when Chinese mahogany is starting to become available in large quantities. Chinese mahogany is the bud (tender leaf) of the toon tree, and buds are the most vigorously growing part of a plant, so Chinese mahogany is very nutritious. However, people with weak stomachs and intestines should not eat a lot at once or swallow it whole just because it tastes good, as this can cause stomach discomfort. As for the saying that Chinese mahogany is a "trigger food" that can easily cause certain diseases, this lacks scientific basis.
    In addition to being nutritious, Chinese mahogany also emits a pleasant fragrance that can stimulate people's appetite. It is usually eaten raw: wash it clean and place it in a bowl, pour in some boiling water, cover it for a while, then take it out and dip it in soy sauce (you can add a little sesame oil to the soy sauce), or chop it up and mix it with tofu or noodles. You can also wash it clean, chop it into small pieces, and stir-fry it with eggs. These ways of eating are more reasonable because the heating temperature is relatively low, or the heating time is short, so the nutrients are rarely destroyed. If the picked Chinese mahogany is no longer very tender, it can be pickled with salt and used to cook meat, make soup, or mix raw in the hot summer days, which is more fragrant and tender than ordinary dried vegetables. The highly nutritious bok choy is not as good as Chinese mahogany. The carotene content of Chinese mahogany is similar to that of bok choy; the calcium and vitamin C content of Chinese mahogany exceeds that of bok choy; as for iron, it is three times that of bok choy; protein is five times that of bok choy; and vitamin B1 reaches seven times that of bok choy.
    People in Jiangnan especially love to eat Chinese mahogany, probably because there are toon trees everywhere in Jiangnan. The toon tree is a deciduous tree. Around Grain Rain (a solar term), the branches sprout dark red tender leaves. By early summer, the color of the tender leaves gradually changes from purple to bluish-green, swaying in the wind, with the charm of a tropical tree. Moreover, in early summer, the branches first form spikes, and then small white flowers bloom, with large leaves and small flowers, blooming very delicately. The trunk of the toon tree is straight and thick, generally about ten feet tall (some can be three or four zhang tall). The wood is solid and durable for making household utensils. The toon tree grows quickly, and every spring and summer, many seedlings sprout around the trunk. Transplanted to any soil, they can grow quickly without much management.
    Chinese mahogany is worth eating and tastes good; the toon tree is worth planting and easy to plant. Therefore, in the future when greening the surroundings, we can plant more of them.

    现在正是香椿开始大量上市的时候。香椿是椿树的芽（嫩叶），芽是植物生长旺盛的部分，所以香椿的养分非常丰富。但是胃肠较弱的人不要因为好吃而一口气吃很多或是囫囵吞枣地吃，这会引起胃部的不适。至于说香椿是“发物”，吃了容易引起某些病，却是缺乏科学根据的说法。
    香椿除了富有营养价值以外，还发出一种好闻的香气，很能引起人们的食欲。一般是生吃：把它洗净放在碗中，浇进些开水，盖一会儿，然后拿出来蘸酱油吃（酱油里可和进少许香油），或切碎拌豆腐、拌面吃。也可以洗净后切成碎末和鸡蛋一块炒熟吃。这些吃法都比较合理，因为加热的温度较低，或者是加热时间较短，所以养分很少受到破坏。如果摘下的香椿已经不太嫩了，可以用盐加工腌制起来，到大热天用以煮肉、冲汤、生拌，比一般菜干香嫩。蔬菜中营养价值较高的小白菜，也比不过香椿。香椿所含的胡萝卜素，同小白菜相仿；香椿所含的钙质、维生素丙，则超过小白菜；至于铁质，则是小白菜的三倍；蛋白质是小白菜的五倍；维生素乙1达到小白菜的七倍。
    江南人特别爱吃香椿，大概是江南处处都有香椿树的缘故。香椿树是一种落叶乔木。谷雨前后，枝头就发出暗红色的嫩叶来。到初夏，嫩叶颜色逐渐由紫转青绿，迎风摇曳，很有热带树的风姿。而且初夏枝头先结穗，再开出白而小的花来，大叶小花，花开得十分细致。香椿树的树干挺直粗壮，一般长一丈左右（高的有三四丈）。木质坚实，制作家用器物，经久耐用。香椿树生长快，每年春夏之交，树干四周发出许多幼苗，移植在任何土壤上，简直不必管理，都能迅速成长。
    香椿值得吃又好吃；香椿树值得种又易种。所以，在今后绿化四旁的时候，大可以多多种植。
