Eradicate Illiteracy with Revolutionary Spirit

    The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production is promoting a great leap forward in literacy work. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen provinces and cities including Henan, Shanxi, Anhui, Fujian, Jilin, and Zhejiang, the number of illiterates enrolled in literacy classes has reached 61 million. A prominent feature of this great leap forward in literacy is that Party committees are taking the lead, illiterates are participating in literacy learning more universally, and their learning enthusiasm is high with rapid progress. Many regions have adopted the method of "the secretary taking command, the whole Party mobilizing, the whole people acting, and everyone running schools"; many places have put forward such a moving slogan: "All literate people should be mobilized to teach others to read, and all illiterate young and middle-aged people should be organized to strive to become literate." A new upsurge in eradicating illiteracy is now forming, which is very exciting. And what is even more gratifying is that not only have many places stirred up revolutionary drive and are preparing to eradicate illiteracy ahead of schedule, but also many places have already seen the emergence of groups of "illiteracy-free" townships (where "illiteracy-free" means that all young and middle-aged people have been freed from illiteracy), illiteracy-free villages, and illiteracy-free counties. By the end of April, 137 counties across the country had basically eradicated illiteracy; Heilongjiang Province had basically eradicated illiteracy among young and middle-aged people throughout the province, becoming the first province in the country to basically eradicate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. This is the beginning of a great cultural revolution in the countryside.
    However, the situation varies greatly across the country; the literacy movement is developing rapidly in some places, while progressing very slowly in others. Those places where progress is slow should, like the advanced areas, seize the favorable opportunity of the production upsurge to promote a great leap forward in cultural work, centering on production to drive all work, including literacy work. In the past, some places relaxed literacy work and popularizing education, resulting in an abnormal phenomenon of the illiteracy rate rising year by year. Of course, as far as the overall situation in the country is concerned, we have already achieved great success in literacy work. In the eight years since liberation, nearly 30 million illiterates have been freed from illiteracy nationwide, with approximately 2.5 to 3 million illiterates in rural areas being freed from illiteracy each year. However, there are still 150 million illiterate young and middle-aged people between the ages of 14 and 40 in rural areas alone. If we continue at the average rate of the past eight years, even if we eliminate illiteracy among 3 million people a year, it would take 50 years to complete, which is a very serious problem.
    Lenin said: "A communist society cannot be built in a country filled with illiterates." Chairman Mao also pointed out: "There are so many illiterates in our country now, and socialist construction cannot wait until illiteracy is eliminated to begin, which creates a sharp contradiction." Can this contradiction be resolved? How can it be resolved? Chairman Mao has already given us clear instructions: "This serious problem must be resolved in the process of agricultural cooperativization, and it can only be resolved in the process of agricultural cooperativization." The facts of those units that have eradicated illiteracy in the process of cooperativization fully prove the correctness of this instruction. We should not only see the seriousness of the illiteracy problem, but also the favorable new situation of the current literacy work, and bring out revolutionary spirit to promote a great leap forward in the work of eradicating illiteracy.
    It now seems that whether the task of eradicating illiteracy can be completed mainly depends on whether the leadership can achieve unified arrangements. The so-called unified arrangement does not mean requiring production and literacy to be on an equal footing, but centering on production to drive literacy work, so that literacy work serves production and ensures that both production and learning are not neglected. Because the main difficulty in literacy work is not anything else, but that the contradiction between literacy and production has not been well resolved, literacy often cannot be prioritized, and is even sometimes inappropriately squeezed out by central work. Of course, there are also some other difficulties in literacy work, such as the fact that some women burdened by household chores and children find it difficult to be mobilized; the teaching quality in some places is not yet high, affecting the learning interest of the masses; and there are also specific difficulties such as kerosene and textbooks. But these difficulties are not insurmountable, and besides, the favorable conditions for literacy now far outweigh the unfavorable ones. After cooperativization, the masses not only demand to learn for the needs of life such as bookkeeping and writing letters, but more importantly, due to the needs of production, especially because the rural areas are carrying out agricultural tool reform and gradually realizing semi-mechanization, mechanization, and electrification, they have ignited a passion for learning. Now, this enthusiasm is getting higher and higher; the peasants of Henan say, "Socialism is heaven, and without culture, you cannot enter." This is the most favorable condition for eradicating illiteracy at present; this is one. Second, millions of primary and secondary school graduates have now participated in agricultural labor, and more primary and secondary school graduates will participate in labor in the future every year. More than one million cadres have now gone to the countryside and mountains, and they "labor as students during the day and teach literacy as teachers at night," which has formed a strong force for eradicating illiteracy. Thirty million people in rural areas have become literate in the literacy campaigns of the past few years, which has created favorable conditions for past illiterates to teach current illiterates. It can be said that the problem of literacy teachers, which was the most difficult to solve in the past, has been basically resolved. Third, after these years of work, the masses have created many effective methods and accumulated a wealth of experience. And many of those who have not yet escaped illiteracy have already recognized some characters or have already changed from illiterates to semi-illiterates, which can be eradicated with just a little more effort.
    In short, there are many favorable conditions. The important question now is how to strengthen leadership and mobilize the masses. Among the units mentioned above that have eradicated illiteracy, many are provinces and counties that were relatively culturally backward in the past, and some are even the poorest mountain gullies. For example, Shaziwan Village in Youyu County, Shanxi Province, which was originally poor and had no one who could read, eradicated illiteracy earlier than some areas located in Jiangnan with higher culture and better conditions. This shows that the speed, quality, good, and bad of literacy work are not due to anything else, but mainly depend on the size of the drive.
    If we want to eradicate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people in the next five to ten years, or even a shorter period of time, without creating several upsurges or several leaps forward, and continuing to eliminate only a few million illiterates a year as in the past few years, then it will be impossible to complete this task.
    How to promote a great leap forward in literacy work? Mainly rely on the masses, follow the mass line, stir up revolutionary drive, and constantly overcome the right-leaning conservative thinking that believes production cannot be combined with literacy. The methods are: overall planning, in stages and batches, in various ways, and with year-round learning.
    Overall planning means that we must first consider eliminating illiteracy, popularizing primary school education, and developing spare-time primary and secondary schools in a unified manner. In the past, the number of illiterates we eliminated each year was 2.5 to 3 million, while 40% of school-age children in our country had not yet enrolled in school by the end of last year, which means that more than 5 million children each year do not have the opportunity to become literate. If we do not pay attention to the education of these children at the same time, and do not block the holes that produce new illiterates, then large illiterates will be eliminated, and small illiterates will grow up, resulting in eliminating 3 million and growing 5 million. Those who have already been freed from illiteracy also have the problem of consolidation and improvement. Without consolidation, they will relapse into illiteracy; without improvement, they still cannot adapt to the needs of production development. The people of our country, especially the youth of our country, cannot be satisfied with escaping illiteracy, but also need a higher level of culture. Some areas have now taken concrete measures for consolidation; Heilongjiang is carrying out activities of reading a hundred books and writing ten thousand characters, and is vigorously developing people-run spare-time middle schools and primary schools.
    The Communist Youth League organization of Shen County, Shandong, proposed the implementation of "one elimination, two blockages, and three improvements," that is, to eliminate existing young and middle-aged illiterates; to block the holes that produce new illiterates - unenrolled school-age children; and to improve those who have been freed from illiteracy by one step, so as not to relapse into illiteracy. This is a good way to eliminate illiteracy and consolidate literacy achievements. Secondly, if we want to eradicate illiteracy during the Second Five-Year Plan period, then we must implement the method of "three years of concentrated effort and two years of mop-up," that is, from this year onwards, we must eliminate 30 to 40 million each year, which is more than ten times faster than in previous years. To this end, from the province to the township, from the city to the countryside, we must conduct specific investigations and specific planning. We must truly understand how many illiterates have been eliminated in our own region and unit, how many illiterates and semi-illiterates there are, how much literacy power there is, what measures to take, and how long it will take to eliminate illiteracy. In some places, there are actually very few illiterates, and with a little effort, they could have been eradicated long ago, but because there was no investigation, no planning, and no clear idea, they were overtaken by some places with poor conditions.
    In stages and batches means that we must adapt to the time, place, and people, and based on subjective and objective conditions, each year, a group of counties in the province, a group of townships in the county, and a group of cooperatives in the township must eliminate illiteracy, so that there are role models in every county and typical examples in every township, so as to drive backward units and encourage the confidence of cadres and the masses through these advanced typical examples. Youth, adults, and women each have their own characteristics in learning; youth learn faster, adults learn slower, and women have more difficulties. Learning together often leads to the phenomenon of "youth not being able to eat enough, and women not being able to eat." Therefore, where conditions permit, youth classes, adult classes, and women's classes can be set up separately. After young illiterates are eliminated first, they can turn around and accelerate the elimination of adult and women's illiteracy.
    Various methods are to adapt to the different characteristics of farmers and the diversification of rural production. Only taking the form of fixed classroom teaching will make it difficult for some people who are willing to learn but cannot learn regularly, and they will lose the opportunity to learn. Therefore, in addition to classroom teaching, we must also take decentralized, irregular, and diverse teaching methods, such as one-on-one teaching, organizing study groups, setting up more literacy boards, etc. Changzhi Prefecture in Shanxi Province organized different study groups according to different labors such as leaving home and going to the mountains, repairing reservoirs, repairing terraced fields, opening canals, digging wells, and improving soil; those at home organized study organizations according to different labors such as raising livestock, ginning cotton, and needlework, and at the same time, they carried out mutual teaching and learning according to the family relationships of husband and wife, sisters-in-law, aunt and sister-in-law, and mother-in-law and daughter-in-law, so that the learning form adapts to different labors, rather than requiring labor to obey the fixed learning form. In the past, the youth literacy teams of the Communist Youth League organizations in various places were a great shock force for eradicating illiteracy. Facts have proved that it is a very good form that should continue to be used. Because of the adoption of this flexible form of learning, it is possible to involve everyone who is illiterate in the tide of literacy.
    Year-round learning is the main guarantee for improving the elimination of illiteracy. If you learn one winter and rest three seasons, it is difficult to avoid the problem of "going to winter school every year and learning from scratch every year." Especially now that winter leisure has become winter busy, and in many places it is even busier than autumn and summer, it is actually impossible to completely entrust the learning time to winter. Some places have already changed the method of "learning more when not busy, learning less when slightly busy, and taking a break from school when very busy" to learning less when very busy and learning more when slightly busy; learning in a decentralized manner when very busy and learning in a centralized manner when slightly busy. This can still take care of the needs of production and the health of farmers. Because overemphasizing "busy" and not learning or learning less, it is indeed difficult to squeeze out learning time. Therefore, it is still necessary to emphasize developing the spirit of diligent study and hard practice, and advocate such a spirit: "Winter leisure becomes winter busy, and the field becomes a classroom"; "Carry books with you, and learn when you have time"; "Don't relax your learning, learn successfully in one breath," so that year-round learning can be persisted to the end. Now, in some places, production work is being carried out vigorously, but literacy work seems cold and deserted. This abnormal phenomenon is because economic work and cultural work have not been arranged in a unified manner. Many experiences have proved that a semi-illiterate can escape illiteracy if they persist in learning for half a year, and an illiterate can escape illiteracy if they persist in learning for a year.
    Eradicating illiteracy is a task of strategic significance, and every revolutionary must be a promoter of literacy, especially the Communist Youth League organization, which is a natural assistant to the Party in eradicating illiteracy, should stir up revolutionary spirit and complete this task with full enthusiasm. As long as we stir up revolutionary drive, and neither force orders nor hinder production, we will definitely be able to complete this literacy task of strategic significance ahead of schedule, and open up a broad road for promoting the development of social productive forces and the technological and cultural revolutions.

### 用革命精神扫除文盲

　　用革命精神扫除文盲
    工农业生产的大跃进，正在推动着扫盲工作的大跃进。据河南、山西、安徽、福建、吉林、浙江等十八个省市不完全的统计，文盲入学人数已达六千一百万人。这次扫盲大跃进的一个突出的特点，是党委领导亲自动手，文盲参加识字学习的比较普遍，并且学习积极性高，学习进度快。许多地区采取“书记挂帅，全党动员，全民动手，大家办学”的办法；许多地方提出了这样一个动人的口号：“一切识字的人都要动员起来教人识字，一切不识字的青壮年都要组织起来努力识字。”目前一个新的扫除文盲的高潮正在形成，这是一件令人十分兴奋的事情。而更加值得我们高兴的是，不仅许多地方鼓起了革命干劲，准备提前扫除文盲，而且已经有不少地方出现了一批无盲乡（“无盲”是指在所有青壮年中都已经扫除了文盲）、无盲村和无盲县。到4月底，全国已有一百三十七个县基本上扫除了文盲；黑龙江省已经在全省范围内基本上扫除了青壮年文盲，成了全国第一个基本上扫除了青壮年文盲的省份。这是农村中伟大的文化革命的开端。
    然而，全国各地的情况还很不平衡，扫盲运动在一些地方发展得很快而在另一些地方却进展得很慢。这些进展很慢的地方，应当像那些先进地区一样，抓住生产高潮促进文化高潮的有利时机，以生产为中心，带动各项工作，包括扫盲工作的大跃进。过去，一些地方由于放松了扫盲工作，又放松了普及教育工作，以致出现了文盲比例逐年上升的不正常现象。当然，就全国整个情况来说，我们在扫盲工作方面已经取得了很大的成绩。解放八年来，全国扫除了近三千万文盲，其中每年扫除农村中的文盲大约是二百五十万到三百万。但是现在十四岁到四十岁的青壮年文盲单在农村中就还有一亿五千万，如果照以往八年的平均速度来扫，即使一年扫三百万，也得五十年才能扫完，这是一个十分严重的问题。
    列宁说过：“在一个文盲充斥的国家内，是建设不了共产主义社会的。”毛主席也指出：“我国现在文盲这样多，而社会主义的建设又不能等到消灭了文盲以后才去开始进行，这就产生了一个尖锐的矛盾。”这个矛盾能不能解决？怎么去解决？毛主席已经给我们做了明确的指示：“这个严重的问题必须在农业合作化的过程中加以解决，也只有在农业合作化的过程中才能解决。”那些在合作化过程中扫除了文盲的单位的事实，完全证明了这一指示的正确。我们既应当看到文盲问题的严重，又应当看到当前扫盲工作有利的新形势，拿出革命精神，来促进扫除文盲工作的大跃进。
    现在看来，扫除文盲的任务能不能完成，主要看领导是不是能做到统一安排。所谓统一安排，不是要求生产、扫盲平起平坐，而是以生产为中心，把扫盲工作带起来，使扫盲工作为生产服务，做到生产学习两不误。因为扫盲工作的主要困难不是别的，而是扫盲和生产的矛盾还没有很好地解决，扫盲往往排不上队，甚至有时不适当地被中心工作挤掉。当然，扫盲工作也还有一些其他方面的困难，例如有些有家务和子女拖累的妇女比较难于发动；有些地方教学质量还不高，影响群众学习兴趣，以及还有灯油、课本等具体困难。但是这些困难都并不是不可克服的，又何况现在扫盲的有利条件比起不利条件来要多得多呢。合作化以后，群众不仅为了记账、写信这些生活上的需要而要求学习，更重要的是由于生产上的需要，目前特别由于农村要进行农具改革和逐步实现半机械化、机械化、电气化而燃起了学习的热情。现在，这种热情是愈来愈高涨了，河南农民说，“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上”。这就是当前扫除文盲最有利的条件，这是一。第二，现在已有几百万中小学毕业生参加了农业劳动，今后每年还会有更多的中小学毕业生参加劳动。现在已经有一百多万干部下乡上山，他们“白天劳动当学生，晚上扫盲当先生”，这就形成了一支强有力的扫盲大军。农村已有三千万人在过去几年扫盲中识了字，这又造成了过去的文盲教现在的文盲的有利条件。可以说，过去最难解决的扫盲师资问题，已经得到了基本解决。第三，经过这几年的工作，群众已经创造了许多有效的方法，积累了许多丰富的经验。而那些还没有脱离文盲状态的人，很多又是识了一些字或已经由文盲变成了半文盲，只要再加一把劲就可以扫除的。
    总之，有利条件多得很，现在的重要问题是如何加强领导、发动群众的问题。上面说到的那些已经扫除了文盲的单位，其中就有不少是过去文化比较落后的省和县，有的还是条件最差的山沟沟。例如原来又穷又没有一个人认字的山西右玉县沙子弯村，反而比一些地处江南、文化较高、条件较好的地区先扫除文盲。这说明了：扫盲工作的快和慢，好和差，原因不在别处，主要决定于干劲的大小。
    要在今后五年到十年，甚至更短一点的时间内扫除青壮年文盲，不造几个高潮，不来几个跃进，而依旧照前几年那样，每年只扫除几百万文盲，那就会无法完成这个任务。
    怎样促进扫盲工作的大跃进？主要依靠群众，走群众路线，鼓起革命干劲，不断克服那种认为生产不能扫盲的右倾保守思想。办法是：全面规划，分期分批，多种方式，长年学习。
    全面规划，就是首先要把扫除文盲、普及小学教育、发展业余的中小学统一起来考虑。我们过去每年扫除文盲的数字是二百五十万到三百万，而我国学龄儿童在去年年底以前还有40％没有入学，也就是说，每年还有五百多万儿童得不到识字的机会。如果不同时注意这部分儿童的教育，不把产生新文盲的洞子堵住，那么大文盲扫掉了，小文盲又长出来了，结果是扫了三百万，又长了五百万。已经扫除了文盲的人，也还有巩固提高的问题。不巩固，会回生复盲；不提高，仍然不能适应生产发展的需要。我国人民，特别是我国青年不能以脱离文盲为满足，还需要更高的文化水平。现在有些地区已采取了巩固的具体措施，黑龙江开展读百本书、写万字的活动，并大力发展民办业余中学和小学。
　　山东莘县共青团组织提出实行“一扫，二堵，三提高”，也就是要做到把现有的青壮年文盲扫掉；把产生新文盲——未入学的少年儿童的洞子堵住；把扫除了文盲的人提高一步，不让回生复盲。这是扫除文盲和巩固扫盲成绩的好办法。其次，如果要在第二个五年计划期间内扫除文盲，那就必须实行“三年突击，两年扫尾”的办法，也就是说，从今年起每年要扫掉三千万到四千万，比往年的速度加快十倍以上才行。为此，从省到乡，从城市到农村都要进行具体的调查和具体的规划。要真正地了解自己的地区和自己单位扫除了多少文盲，还有多少文盲、半文盲，有多大的扫盲力量，要采取什么措施，要多长时间才能把文盲扫除。有的地方文盲实际已经很少，稍加努力，本来早就可以扫除，但因为没有调查，没有规划，心中无数，结果反被一些条件差的地方赶上来了。
    分期分批，就是要因时因地因人制宜，根据主客观条件，每年都做到省有一批县，县有一批乡，乡有一批社扫掉文盲，做到县县有榜样，乡乡有典型，以便通过这些先进的典型去带动落后单位，鼓舞干部和群众的信心。青年、壮年、妇女在学习上各有各的特点，青年学习起来比较快，壮年比较慢，妇女困难较多，混在一起学，常常发生“青年吃不饱，妇女吃不了”的现象。所以有条件的地方，可以分别开设青年班、壮年班和妇女班。青年文盲先扫除了，回过头来又可以加速扫除壮年和妇女的文盲。
    多种方式，是为了适应农民的不同特点和农村生产的多样化。只采取固定的班级教学的形式，会使一些愿意学习而又不能定时学习的人感到困难，失掉学习的机会。因此在班级教学之外，还要采取分散的、不定时的、多种多样的教学方式，例如包教包学，组织学习小组，多设识字牌等等。山西长治专区按照离家上山、修水库、修梯田、开渠、打井、改良土壤的不同劳动，组织了不同的学习小组；在家的又按照饲养、轧花、针工的不同劳动组织了学习组织，同时还按照夫妇、妯娌、姑嫂、婆媳的家庭关系进行互教互学，使学习形式适应不同的劳动，而不是要劳动去服从固定的学习形式。过去，各地共青团组织的青年扫盲队，是扫除文盲一支很大的突击力量。事实证明是一个很好的应当继续运用的形式。由于采用了这种灵活的学习形式，就有可能使一切不识字的人都卷进扫盲的浪潮里来。
    长年学习，这是提高扫除文盲的主要保证。如果学一冬，歇三季，那就很难避免“年年上冬学，年年从头学”的毛病。特别是现在冬闲变成冬忙，有许多地方甚至比秋夏还忙，把学习时间完全寄托在冬季，实际已经作不到。有些地方已经把“不忙多学，小忙少学，大忙放学”的办法，改成大忙少学，小忙多学；大忙分散学，小忙集中学。这样仍然能够照顾生产的需要和农民的健康。因为过分强调“忙”就不学或少学，那的确很难挤出学习时间。所以还是要强调发扬勤学苦练的精神，提倡这样一种劲头：“冬闲变冬忙，田间变课堂”；“书本随身带，有空学起来”；“学习别放松，一气学成功”，使长年学习能够坚持到底。现在有些地方的生产工作搞得热火朝天，扫盲工作却显得冷冷清清，这种不正常的现象，就是因为没有把经济工作和文化工作进行统一的安排。许多经验证明：一个半文盲能够坚持学习半年，一个文盲能够坚持学习一年，那就一定可以脱离文盲状态。
    扫除文盲是一项具有战略意义的任务，每一个革命者都要当扫盲的促进派，特别是作为党扫除文盲的天然助手——共青团组织，更应该鼓起革命精神，以满腔热情来完成这一任务。只要我们鼓起了革命干劲，而又一不强迫命令，二不妨碍生产，我们就一定可以提前完成这个具有战略意义的扫盲任务，为促进社会生产力的发展和技术革命和文化革命开辟出宽广的道路。
