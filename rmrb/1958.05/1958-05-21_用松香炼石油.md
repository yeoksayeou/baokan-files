Refining Petroleum from Rosin

The Guangzhou Joint State-Private Asia-Africa Chemical Factory has successfully extracted diesel, kerosene, and gasoline from low-grade rosin or heavy-grade turpentine. After testing and use, its performance is similar to that of mineral petroleum, and the price is relatively low. Now, this factory with just over 70 people is merging and expanding with another factory of over 100 people, and it will produce 3,000 tons of petroleum this year.

    用松香炼石油
    广州市公私合营亚三洲化工厂从低级松香或重级松节油中提炼出柴油、火油和汽油成功，经过化验和使用，其性能同矿物石油相仿，而且价格比较低廉。现在这个只有七十多人的工厂正在跟另一家一百多人的工厂合并扩建，今年内将要生产石油三千吨。　（据新华社讯）
