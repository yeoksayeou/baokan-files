    The Afforestation Quality in Yu County is Good
    After seeing Zhu Benhe's article "Plant Trees Well" in the Readers' Letters column of the People's Daily on March 31, we immediately organized an inspection.
    The inspection results showed that the quality of afforestation is generally good. Taking the Yu-Xu Highway as an example, the survival rate of trees planted along the road is 83%; a tree-by-tree inspection of a small forest plot in Beiguan showed a survival rate of 93%. However, in some individual places, technical work has not kept up. We are taking measures to further strengthen the management of young trees.
    The achievements of our county in greening and afforestation are fundamental. Zhu Benhe's letter said that Yu County's afforestation has always been a flash in the pan, which is inconsistent with the actual situation.

    禹县造林质量是好的
    我们看到3月31日人民日报读者来信栏内登载了朱本和“种树要种好”一文后，立即组织了检查。
    检查结果造林质量一般是很好的。就禹许公路讲，路旁植树成活83％；北关小片林地逐株检查成活93％。但在个别地方，技术工作没赶上也是有的。我们正采取措施，进一步加强幼林管理。
    我县绿化造林成绩是基本的。朱本和的来信中说禹县历年造林都是虎头蛇尾这与实际情况是有出入的。
