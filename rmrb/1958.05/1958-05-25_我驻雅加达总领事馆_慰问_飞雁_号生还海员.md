Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, May 24th -- The Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta sent personnel to express condolences to the nine Chinese sailors from the "Flying Geese" ship who are currently residing in a Jakarta hotel. The sailors expressed their deep gratitude for the kind concern of the Consulate General.

The sailors recounted the experience of being bombed by American planes to the Consulate General personnel, saying that the American planes deliberately bombed the "Flying Geese" ship. They said that the ship was flying a large Panamanian flag at the time, and the unmarked American plane was flying very low during the bombing, so the personnel on the plane must have been able to see the flag on the ship.

    我驻雅加达总领事馆
    慰问“飞雁”号生还海员
    据新华社雅加达24日电　中国驻雅加达总领事馆派人员慰问目前住在雅加达旅馆的九名“飞雁”号轮船的中国籍船员。船员们对总领事馆的亲切关怀表示非常感激。
    船员们向总领事馆人员叙述遭到美国飞机轰炸的经过说，美国飞机是故意轰炸“飞雁”号轮船的。他们说，船上当时挂着一面很大的巴拿马国旗，而没有标志的那架美国飞机在轰炸时又飞得很低，机上人员是一定可以看到船上旗帜的。
