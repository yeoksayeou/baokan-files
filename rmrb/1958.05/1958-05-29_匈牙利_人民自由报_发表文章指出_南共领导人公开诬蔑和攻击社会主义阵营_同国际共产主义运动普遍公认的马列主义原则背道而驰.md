Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 26th - The Hungarian "People's Freedom" recently published an article entitled "The Seventh Congress of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia (LCY) and the International Communist Movement."

The article states that the congresses of communist parties of various countries are of extremely great significance for the development of all communist parties and the workers' movements of various countries. Certain party congresses are by no means limited to being important for the workers' movement of a specific country, but also have an impact on the communist and workers' movements of other countries, especially neighboring countries. The communist and workers' movement is an international movement that can only develop and achieve great victories as an international movement. The Seventh Congress of the LCY has also aroused strong interest in the international communist movement. The fraternal parties expected this congress, expecting that at this congress, the LCY would approach the concepts unanimously advocated by the communist parties of various countries on those issues in dispute. Unfortunately, this was not the case, and therefore, this congress did not arouse attention, but rather caused considerable consternation, and a renewed, heated debate on many issues of fundamental importance, especially on issues related to the international situation and the international communist movement.

Marxism-Leninism is an international doctrine, and its unique nature is not fundamentally changed by the fact that in all countries, the application of Marxism-Leninism should take into account specific circumstances and should be considered in accordance with Marxism-Leninism. The reason why the communist parties and workers' parties of various countries have been able to develop and achieve great victories is primarily because they have broken through national boundaries, united, and learned from each other through the exchange of experiences, observation of achievements, and correction of mistakes. Discussing common issues related to the common struggle together, forming a unified view on major issues related to the international situation, jointly defining the main goals of the international struggle, and establishing a solid and unified fighting front: these are the long-standing traditions of revolutionary workers' parties, and an indispensable condition for their development and growth. On the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution, representatives of communist parties from socialist countries gathered in Moscow, and after joint discussions, jointly drafted and unanimously adopted the well-known declaration, which was later adopted by communist parties in capitalist countries. Only one party avoided joining the unified front of the international communist movement, and that was the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Its representatives participated in the celebration of the October Revolution in Moscow, but they were not originally prepared to participate in the meeting of parties of socialist countries. Our party representatives could not understand at that time why the LCY did not participate in this meeting and why it refused to sign the Moscow Declaration. However, a more comforting thing was that the Yugoslav comrades participated in the meeting of sixty-four parties and signed the peace declaration drafted at the meeting. However, after the draft program of the LCY was published, the reason why the LCY was determined to avoid the communist parties of socialist countries at that time and why it had no intention of participating in discussions on common issues together became clear. In fact, the draft program to be submitted to the LCY Congress was already being drafted at that time, and the drafters of this program were fully aware that they had deviated from the universally recognized Marxist-Leninist arguments and demonstrations of the international communist movement, especially on those issues that were bound to be included in the agenda of the meeting of the twelve parties.

In our opinion, the LCY leaders bore an internationalist responsibility to the international communist movement and to their own party, which was that they should have used the opportunity provided by the Moscow meeting for the Yugoslav comrades to raise all principled differences at the highest-level meeting of representatives of all socialist countries for fraternal discussion. The LCY did not do so, but preferred to adopt a nationalist isolationist attitude, thus making it impossible for themselves to learn from a high-level meeting what they might consider good and beneficial lessons. After the LCY deliberately adopted this isolated attitude towards the other twelve parties in Moscow, it then launched a principled and political attack on the international communist movement that signed and adopted the Moscow Declaration and thus consolidated its unity, especially attacking the communist parties of the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. This attack began with the LCY's publication of the draft program, and unfortunately became even more serious due to the emotional and slanderous reports, discussions, and debates at the congress. The LCY draft program states: "Whether a certain idea or a certain form of socialist construction is correct depends only on whether it has vitality and whether it can withstand the test of practice," and not on the approval of this or that international conference. In order to oppose such international conferences, the LCY has stipulated the following tasks for the workers' movement, especially for the communists of socialist countries: "To fight for equal relations in theory and practice." But who should be fought against to strive for equal relations? According to the drafters of the LCY draft program, it is necessary to fight against those who are unwilling to have equal relations, because these people are trying to ensure ideological monopoly, etc. Obviously, this is first and foremost a blatant attack on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and on the international workers' movement. The purpose of this attack is to ensure that every party has the right to evaluate Marxism in its own special way, and has the right to interpret Marxism according to its own will, and other parties have no room to interfere in this issue. At the same time, the LCY reserves for itself the full right to make statements and judgments on the ideas and activities of all other parties, and considers itself fully entitled to believe that only its ideas and activities are correct.

The article says that first of all, it is necessary to refute the statement that the discussions and resolutions of this international conference are intended to "impose" any views or theories on any party. None of the parties that participated in drafting and signing the Moscow Declaration were "forced" to participate in the preparatory work, and none of them passed this declaration without expressing their consent. Doubting this is baseless slander. The shameless slander of creating turmoil must be refuted. We are convinced that the reason why all communist parties in capitalist countries have approved the Moscow Declaration is not, as the foolish slander of international reactionaries says, because someone "imposed" a certain decision on them, but simply because their views are the same. The drafters of the LCY draft program have no right to doubt this basic fact, and have no right to shamelessly doubt the fraternal communist parties without specifically pointing out the facts. No one will force the LCY or any communist party to obey the decisions of an international conference of communists against its beliefs. There is no reason for a party to agree to the resolutions of an international conference on ideological and political issues against its own beliefs. But it is extremely important that fraternal communist parties of various countries continuously strengthen their ideological and political consistency on fundamental issues concerning the international situation, the international workers' movement, and the construction of socialism through the exchange and exploration of their respective experiences, and through theoretical discussions of possible differences. For this reason, bilateral talks must be conducted, joint resolutions must be made between the parties, and meetings must be held between the fraternal parties for broader consultations to make resolutions.

In the course of the development of the international communist movement, there may be periods when such extensive consultations are interrupted due to extraordinary situations such as the years of the Second World War, or unhealthy or abnormal situations such as those that arose after 1949. But the task of the communists is not to derive certain "laws" based on past abnormal situations, but to ensure the strengthening of cooperation between the fraternal parties through bilateral or broader consultations, and through the making of joint resolutions, so that abnormal states no longer occur. Moreover, the task of the communist party is not to spread doubts about any "international conference" of communists, and not to elevate this doubt to a programmatic and theoretical point, but to eliminate doubts through fraternal discussions on principled differences. Any party that claims that the international communist movement should abandon this high-level meeting of international cooperation and abandon the continuous strengthening of ideological and political unity will inevitably isolate itself, but it cannot prevent the international communist movement from strengthening unity.

The article states that after the draft program published by the LCY was fully studied by the communist parties of various countries, it immediately aroused sharp principled disputes. The characteristic of the dispute is that it resolutely defends the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism in the spirit of comradely assistance, and resolutely refutes the ideological and political attacks on the Moscow Declaration. All criticisms have consistently defended the Moscow Declaration, opposed the LCY draft program's attack on it, and pointed out the serious anti-Marxist errors of the LCY draft program. It is the right and internationalist obligation of all communist parties to warn each other when they see a certain party exhibiting serious principled errors in its ideology and practical policies. This comradely warning and principled criticism of the LCY draft program are made with the intention of helping. Unfortunately, this comradely criticism has not achieved the desired effect. One or two incorrect statements in the draft program directed at the Soviet Union and the socialist camp have been deleted and softened, but the basic anti-Marxist errors have been retained. Moreover, the reports and discussions at the congress have further elaborated on these errors. They responded to comradely criticisms with fierce attacks, and questioned whether the fraternal communist parties had the right to regard the LCY draft program as a target of criticism. They said this was "interference in the internal affairs of the LCY." The report on the draft program (made by Kardelj) explained the right to judge others and the inviolability of their own ideas as follows: "When we fight for unity and cooperation in everything that is conducive to peace and social progress, we do not abandon the ideological struggle, and do not abandon the criticism of opportunism, reformism, dogmatism, revisionism, etc. Adapting to this position of ours, we will reject any attempt to interfere in our affairs. We will not allow people to impose foreign ideas on us." What kind of "adaptation" is this! On the one hand, it gives the LCY the right to criticize anyone, and on the other hand, it denies other parties the right to criticize the LCY's program, and it is precisely in this document that "reformism, dogmatism, revisionism, etc." are embodied. Naturally, it is the LCY's own right and responsibility to decide whether to pay attention to these criticisms, whether to correct the anti-Marxist views that the fraternal parties consider to be erroneous, or to adhere to these views and use incorrect accusations and "smear" policies to respond to principled disputes, and no one has the right or the ability to make decisions on the LCY's affairs on behalf of the LCY. However, every fraternal party has the right to pay close attention to the LCY's decisions and activities, and to form its own views on it, whether individually or collectively.

Insisting that critics want to "impose" "foreign ideas" on the LCY in order to avoid the fraternal parties' well-intentioned criticisms based on the principle of helping to defend unity and cooperation. We cannot, in any case, consider this to be correct.

The Seventh Congress of the LCY failed to benefit from the principled criticisms of the fraternal parties, and approved a program full of dangerous errors. The spirit, content, tone, and the program adopted in the reports made and discussions held at the congress have aroused further sharp criticisms from the communist parties of various countries. The well-known editorial published by the "People's Daily" after the LCY Congress pointed out that at this recent LCY Congress, "a systematic and complete revisionist program was further put forward."

The "Pravda" article of May 9th explained the untenable nature of the extremely erroneous, unjust, and exceptionally outrageous remarks made by Comrade Tito in his report at the congress regarding the international workers' movement, especially regarding the policies of the socialist camp and the Soviet Union, and refuted these remarks.

The article said, let us give an example to illustrate that the "Pravda" article and the article in the "Communist" magazine published before it are measured. These two articles did not mention a very strange fact: the fourth chapter of the LCY draft program talked about and analyzed Yugoslavia's anti-fascist liberation struggle, in which the role played by the Soviet army in the liberation of Yugoslavia was not mentioned at all. The famous Belgrade battle, conducted by the glorious Soviet army in cooperation with the heroic Yugoslav guerrillas, was one of the most brilliant combat events of World War II. This battle was an important component of the Soviet army's great liberation struggle against Hitler. In this battle and after this battle, many sons and daughters of the Soviet people paid with their lives for the freedom of the Yugoslav people. The LCY has now passed this draft program, which analyzes Yugoslavia's liberation war, but avoids the fact and significance of the great battles directly conducted by the Soviet army on Yugoslav territory. "Pravda" and "Communist" did not criticize this, but limited themselves to making criticisms on the most important issues related to the current situation. However, the LCY program, on the one hand, avoided mentioning the Soviet army's battle in Yugoslavia, and on the other hand, talked a lot about their disputes from 1948 to 1954 and the harm suffered by Yugoslavia. Indeed, other socialist countries did harm Yugoslavia, but since then, we have clarified these and have eliminated them. The LCY Seventh Congress has brought these out again, and made it seem as if the LCY itself has never made any mistakes, and as if it is correct in all aspects. In other words, the LCY leadership group did not bravely examine its own views and correct its own mistakes by means of the Belgrade Declaration of 1955, which was initiated by the CPSU. It is a pity that the LCY leadership group did not do this. This is only an attempt to reap political capital from the harm suffered by Yugoslavia, while also benefiting from the elimination of this harm.

The criticisms of the fraternal parties are completely justified in pointing out that in 1956, when Hungarian revisionism was rampant, the LCY leadership group supported it and raised the banner of "anti-Stalinism," and the situation at that time was precisely when the international reactionaries used and exaggerated the exposure of Stalin's mistakes to launch a full-scale attack on the international communist movement. Yugoslavia has now brought out the "smear policy" against the Soviet Union again, while it had previously requested extensive economic assistance from the Soviet Union and had received this assistance. The LCY Seventh Congress is such a practice.

As for the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, at the beginning of last year, the characteristics of our relationship with the LCY were differences in views on the issue of counter-revolution and the victory over the counter-revolutionary riots. Later, our party was reorganized and consolidated, the workers' regime was strengthened, and the consolidation of the political situation was realized on the basis of our policies, and it was unexpectedly rapid. Since then, our disputes have stopped, and the relations between our two countries have improved. We had hoped that the relations between the communist parties of the socialist camp and the LCY would also be fundamentally improved on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. The LCY's non-participation in the talks of the parties of socialist countries naturally could not strengthen this hope of ours, but we still believed that this was only a temporary retreat. However, the LCY Seventh Congress showed that the major principled differences that were basically correctly pointed out in the Cominform's resolution of 1948 still exist, and have even grown during the abnormal period from 1949 to 1954. The article pointed out that these differences hinder the development of the close and friendly relations that countries building socialism should not only be able to have but must have between the socialist camp and Yugoslavia. The true friendship and true brotherly solidarity of those who fight for common ideals can only be based on principled policies and only on Marxist-Leninist principled policies.

The article criticized the LCY Seventh Congress's revisionist evaluation of the trend of state capitalism and the re-evaluation of the nature of the bourgeois state. The article pointed out that Kardelj's report at the congress did not explain which capitalist country had its bourgeois state become independent of monopoly capital due to the trend of state capitalism approved by monopoly capital. If the drafters of the LCY program had at least put forward one or two capitalist countries, believing that their "vigorous development of state capitalism" proved that these capitalist countries were "unstoppably" and "deeply entering the socialist era," if they pointed out the names of these capitalist countries, then the communist parties of these countries would obviously use very important facts to explain to the Yugoslav comrades what the trend of state capitalism idealized by the LCY actually proves.

The article said that many people believe that idealizing the trend of state capitalism in capitalist countries and having illusions about the growing economic role of the capitalist state machine only paralyzes the development of the workers' movement in capitalist countries, and that it is important to fight against these views only there, and that only the struggle against these erroneous ideas and illusions there is an important component of the anti-reformist struggle. Our experience shows that spreading this view in countries building socialism can also become a dangerous means of blurring socialist consciousness. The revisionist faction of Nagy also used this in their propaganda. Nagy believed that people's democratic countries are democratic countries of a capitalist nature, in which nationalized industries, enterprises, and banks cannot form the socialist component of the national economy, but only the state capitalist component. This state capitalist industrial component and the small commodity production component of the peasants will enter socialism through the "democratic road," without the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat, and "the cooperative movement is also not needed on the part of the peasants." According to him, the dictatorship of the proletariat is not necessary. Only "dogmatists" advocate that it must be established. In the "unfortunately secret" debates held at the meetings of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Working People's Party from 1947 to 1949, Nagy backed down, but later returned to his original position. From 1953 to 1954, he completely returned to his original position. His articles secretly written and distributed in 1955-1956, and finally his open and complete betrayal during the counter-revolution, all nakedly showed that using this argument to arouse illusions about state capitalism had been one of the "ideological" weapons used by the revisionists to create confusion. They have used this weapon to induce those who have been confused by them to accept the restoration of capitalism, using the slogan of a "more democratic" and "Hungarian socialist road" that does not require the dictatorship of the proletariat. This led the revisionists of the Nagy gang to the shameful road of restoring bourgeois parties, completely surrendering to bourgeois parties, and assisting white terror. What is even more astonishing to us is that the LCY Seventh Congress regarded the same illusions about state capitalism spread by the Nagy gang as programmatic provisions. And these illusions have fully shown that if there is no full ideological counterattack, they serve the reactionary cause against the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The article said, after pointing out the fact that the illusions of state capitalism served the cause of bourgeois restoration in Hungary: we believe that we have a responsibility to remind the Yugoslav comrades of this, the generous fraternal assistance of the socialist countries, especially the armed assistance of the Soviet Union, not only enabled us to quickly defeat the Hungarian counter-revolution, but also saved Yugoslavia and the LCY from seeing enterprises turn into bourgeois state-owned property as a state capitalist component and entering the "socialist era" so deeply after the counter-revolution prevailed in Hungary and in fascist Hungary.

The article then criticized the LCY's views on the socialist world system and the socialist camp. The article said that the LCY has formulated its special view on the existence of two world systems, and the LCY is unwilling to know the "geographical" facts of the socialist world system, denying that the socialist world system is a system composed of many countries. Similarly, they also deny the "geographical" facts of the capitalist world system, that is, deny that capitalist countries also form a system composed of many countries. The LCY Congress accepted the argument that the capitalist and socialist world systems exist as two "social processes," not mutually separated in the state but mutually embracing. Indeed, in capitalist countries, there are also socialist "social processes"; in countries building socialism, capitalist "social processes" have not disappeared, and the LCY is only willing to know this and declare this as two mutually embracing "world systems." However, the capitalist world system as a system composed of many countries is a fact. Whether the LCY admits it or not, denying this fact is obviously related to the above-mentioned concept, that is, it is believed that capitalist countries can also "deeply enter the socialist era" without breaking away from the capitalist world system, or that it is closely related to the revisionist view on the trend of state capitalism. The socialist system as a system composed of many countries is also a historical fact, and its establishment is the greatest historical achievement of the contemporary era. Denying the existence of two world systems as systems composed of many countries is tantamount to disregarding the facts. This is one of the most representative and resolutely refuted arguments of modern revisionism.

This revisionist argument can "theoretically" explain why Yugoslavia is unwilling to establish a common fraternal camp with other socialist countries. We should know, and in fact we do know, that Yugoslavia is standing outside, because they have decided so. If other socialist countries are willing to establish the same fraternal unity with Yugoslavia, then whether Yugoslavia continues to stand outside completely depends on how it decides. No one has forced Yugoslavia to make another decision in the past and now, but the LCY cannot force anyone to accept its anti-Marxist views, or tell others to know it but not to say it. We know the fact that Yugoslavia is standing outside, but we are going to refute the fact of standing outside as a reason for putting forward thorough revisionism and making incorrect accusations against the countries of the socialist camp.

The LCY program accuses the existence of fraternal relations between socialist camp countries that are not based on equality, that the stronger country, the Soviet Union, makes other countries "subordinate" to it, infringing on the independence and autonomy of other countries, while other socialist countries are content with this "subordinate relationship." The LCY leaders say that only they represent the cause of equality and independence of all countries. However, the way of defending "independence" by slandering the socialist camp countries is nothing but a manifestation of nationalism and a crude violation of the idea of proletarian internationalism. Although they repeatedly propagate that Yugoslavia's departure from the socialist camp is true internationalism, slandering the socialist camp is conducive to conspiracies aimed at disintegrating the unity of the socialist camp. If this propaganda succeeds without giving it a proper response, the LCY's false accusations will naturally encourage the imperialist war blocs and the reactionary forces within the socialist countries.

The Hungarian events of 1956 clearly showed that the conspiracy to slander the socialist camp and the leading country of the socialist camp - the Soviet Union, to make the country break away from the socialist camp and break away from the fraternal alliance with the Soviet Union, only benefits the dark plans of the forces of bourgeois restoration. The revisionists of the Nagy gang, who organized the elimination of the proletarian regime, also used the glorification of Yugoslavia "outside the camp" and attempted to make Hungary break away from the socialist camp to carry out bourgeois restoration. The struggle against any danger of slandering the socialist camp should be regarded as our special responsibility. We emphasize reminding the Hungarian working class and the international workers' movement to pay attention to this aspect.

There have been confusions in the mutual relations of socialist countries. Mistakes should be corrected, but the way is not to use it to reject the socialist camp, but to strengthen the socialist camp. Avoiding slander against the socialist camp is Yugoslavia's internationalist obligation. If they do not give up slander, if they continue to express doubts about the independence of those socialist countries that are ideologically consistent with the Moscow Declaration rather than with the LCY's ideas, if they want to continue to follow the path of making incorrect accusations against the socialist camp, then they will block the path for the continued development of the friendship between these countries and Yugoslavia. Even so, the socialist camp will be further strengthened. In the flames of the common struggle against the Hungarian counter-revolution, in the common struggle against the rampant slander movement of the entire international reactionaries, the proletarian international unity and the socialist camp united under this ideology have been tempered to be stronger. We hope that the further development of the socialist world system will lead to the improvement of the friendly relations between the socialist camp and Yugoslavia, but there is an indispensable condition, that the LCY leadership group should completely transfer the abuse of the socialist camp to the imperialists, which is their "profession." Indeed, only when Yugoslavia actively opposes the socialist camp countries, especially the Soviet Union, do the propagandists and politicians of the Western powers "recognize" Yugoslavia as an independent country. Conversely, if the growing consensus and further rapprochement replace ideological differences and disputes, they will shout that Yugoslavia has "surrendered." We believe that the LCY cannot allow anyone to represent the LCY to implement similar tactics against the socialist camp countries, and to implement similar tactics against the communist parties of various countries that refuse the LCY's strange views and accept the Moscow Declaration.

Next, the article criticized the part of the LCY's revisionist theory of the state concerning the socialist state. The article said that the criticisms of the fraternal parties and our critical articles in the "Social Review" have refuted the distorted argument about the "totalitarianism" of the socialist state, and criticized the argument that the socialist state has become a reactionary and progressive force. When the Nagy group became a part of the counter-revolutionary group and played an important role in the ideological preparation of the counter-revolutionary riots, it also spread such views.

The LCY makes distorted accusations of "state totalitarianism" against other socialist countries, but publicizes Yugoslavia's state as an example of overcoming the danger of "state totalitarianism." It also puts the issue of the demise of the state on the agenda, and has implemented huge changes in this direction, replacing the state with "social autonomy."

The characteristic that distinguishes the socialist state from all previous states is that it is not the state of a minority, but the state of the majority. The people's state is the political organ of the people against the minority of exploiters who have been deprived of their political power, so the socialist state is not a political power that is detached from society or above society, but a political power that extensively absorbs people from all strata to participate in handling social and state affairs. It is in this sense that Lenin called the socialist state a "semi-state," because the phenomenon of detachment from society and supra-sociality is disappearing. It is well known that when the state is the political organ of a minority of exploiters who rule, then this detachment is inevitable. If we want to talk about "social autonomy," we should affirm that the socialist state is the highest form of "social autonomy."

We believe that it is incorrect and dangerous to underestimate the role of the state and the LCY's new theory about the demise of the state. The socialist state must not evade its responsibility for establishing and continuously developing a centrally guided socialist planned economy. If the planning of the socialist economy is weakened in the spirit of "social autonomy," and the centralized leadership is weakened, this will become a source of serious difficulties and errors.

The Central Committee of the LCY studied the negative phenomena in Yugoslavia's political, economic, and social life in February of this year, and wrote a letter to the party masses, calling for a struggle against these negative phenomena. This letter pointed out that there are bureaucratic tendencies in the central and local organs, including the "social autonomy" organizations. The letter said: "The fanaticism of construction and investment has made the enterprise leaders in some local organs and enterprise leading organs almost unable to see anything other than their own needs and narrow interests." The letter pointed out that the reasons for the emergence of privileged ideas and chauvinistic tendencies, "especially in economic life," are mostly due to the influence spread by the "remnants of the petty-bourgeois nationalist intellectuals." The letter also pointed out that there are anarchism, favoritism, waste, and other negative phenomena, and called for a tenacious struggle to overcome all of this.

It should be pointed out that the theory enshrined as sacred in the LCY program precisely guarantees the ideological basis for a part of the negative phenomena mentioned above. In our opinion, the leaders of the LCY and the Yugoslav state are only fighting against the manifestations of some negative phenomena, but have not fully revealed that the most important root causes of these phenomena are: underestimating the centralized guiding role of the state, opposing the "social autonomy" organizations to the central state organs, and weakening the economic functions of the central state organs and helping to spread the theory of privileged ideas, chauvinism, and anarchism. Now this theory has become a programmatic provision.

Kardelj made the following remarks about the demise of the state in his report at the congress: "Our practice so far shows that the functions of the state first begin to shrink in the economic, educational, cultural, and social service aspects, while the state's repressive role, 'the role of the state as a tool of power for the working people,' shrinks less." However, Marxist theory of the state teaches that the path of the demise of the socialist state is that on the one hand, the repressive role of the state gradually disappears, and on the other hand, the economic and cultural functions of the state develop, and finally, the state organs, as political organs, are transformed into management organs for organizing and guiding social economy and other things. Communism is not a loose union of various anarchist associations, in other words, not a loose union of "social autonomy" groups, but the highest-level, scientifically organized leadership-planned management system. The road to this goal is not to weaken the economic functions of the state, but to develop this function, including perfecting centralized guidance, and constantly developing the cooperation and division of labor between central economic organs and local economic organs. No matter how we say that "social autonomy" organizations will increasingly "accept" the economic functions of the state, the socialist state and its leaders cannot escape any part of the huge tasks burdened by the state economic organs, and cannot push the responsibility for problems and difficulties in economic leadership to non-state "social autonomy" organizations.

This is our position. Is it to accept some of it? Or to reject it? This is the sovereignty of the LCY, whether to continue to experiment with weakening the centralized guidance of the state, and first of all to experiment in the economic life, that is the LCY's own business! However, other socialist countries do not follow the LCY's example of "state decline," and the LCY has no right to slander them as "bureaucratic and state totalitarian countries."

The article finally said that if the leading party of a socialist country cannot get rid of its erroneous views on basic and important issues in time, then despite its heroic history, it will put the proletarian regime and the socialist cause in danger in its country.

    匈牙利“人民自由报”发表文章指出
    南共领导人公开诬蔑和攻击社会主义阵营
    同国际共产主义运动普遍公认的马列主义原则背道而驰
    新华社布达佩斯26日电　匈牙利“人民自由报”最近发表文章，题目是“南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟第七次代表大会和国际共产主义运动”。
    文章说，各国共产党的代表大会，对于所有共产党和各国工人运动的发展，具有极其重大的意义。某些党代表大会决不限于对一个特定国家的工人运动有重要意义，而是对其他国家、特别是对邻国的共产主义和工人运动产生影响。共产主义和工人运动是一种只能作为国际运动才能发展和取得巨大胜利的国际运动。南共第七次代表大会也在国际共产主义运动中引起了强烈的兴趣。各兄弟党期待着这次代表大会，它们期待着在这次代表大会上，南共将在那些发生争执的问题上接近各国共产党一致主张的观念。不幸的是，事情的经过却不是如此，因此，这次代表大会不是引起了重视，而是引起了相当的惊愕，引起在许多具有根本重要性的问题上，特别是在有关国际形势和国际共产主义运动的问题上，重新进行激烈的争论。
    马克思列宁主义是一种国际性学说，它的独一无二的性质根本不因为下列事实而有所改变：在一切国家里，运用马克思列宁主义时应该考虑到具体情况，而且应该依据马克思列宁主义来考虑。各国共产党和工人党之所以能发展并取得巨大的胜利，首先是因为它们冲破了国界，团结一致，通过交流经验、观摩成就、纠正错误而互相学习。一起讨论有关共同斗争的共同问题，在有关国际形势的主要问题上形成一致的看法，协同规定国际斗争的主要目标，并建立坚固统一的斗争阵线：这些都是革命的工人政党的悠久传统，而且是它们发展壮大的一个不可或缺的条件。在伟大十月社会主义革命四十周年之际，社会主义各国共产党的代表们云集在莫斯科，他们经过共同的交谈，一同起草并一致通过了众所周知的宣言，资本主义各国的共产党后来也采纳了这个宣言。只有一个党避不参加国际共产主义运动的统一阵线，这就是南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟。它的代表们参加了在莫斯科举行的十月革命庆祝，但是他们原来就不预备参加社会主义国家各党的会议。我们党的代表们当时不能理解南共为什么不参加这次会议，为什么它拒绝在莫斯科宣言上签字。可是比较使人宽慰的一件事，是南斯拉夫同志们参加了六十四国党的会议之后，在会议拟定的和平宣言上签了字。然而，在南共的纲领草案公布之后，南共当时为什么决意避开社会主义各国共产党、为什么它无意一起参加讨论共同有关的问题的原因，就昭然若揭了。事实上，准备提交南共代表大会的纲领草案那时已经在草拟中，而且这个纲领的起草人完全知道，他们已经同国际共产主义运动普遍公认的马克思列宁主义论断和论证背道而驰，特别是在那些势必要列入十二国党会议议程的问题上。
    在我们看来，南共领导人对国际共产主义运动以及对他们自己的党，本来负有一种国际主义责任，这就是他们应当利用莫斯科会议为南斯拉夫同志们提供的机会，把一切原则分歧在所有社会主义国家的代表们的最高级会议上提出，来兄弟般地加以讨论。南共没有这样做，而宁愿采取民族主义的孤立态度，这样他们就使自己无法从一次高级会议上吸取他们可能认为良好而有益的教训。南共在莫斯科对其他十二个党故意采取这种孤立态度之后，继而又在原则上和政治上公开攻击签署和通过了莫斯科宣言、因而巩固了自己的团结的国际共产主义运动，特别是攻击以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国共产党。这种攻击是由南共公布纲领草案开始的，而且由于代表大会上的感情用事的和诬蔑性的报告、讨论和论争而不幸地变得更加严重。南共纲领草案说：“某种思想或某种社会主义建设形式是否正确，只取决于它是否具有生命力，是否经得起实践的考验”，而不取决于这一个或那一个国际会议的赞成。为了反对这种国际会议，南共为工人运动、特别是为社会主义国家的共产党人规定了如下的任务：“为争取在理论上和实际上的平等关系而斗争”。但是以谁为斗争对象而争取平等关系呢？据南共纲领草案的起草人说，要对不愿意关系平等的人们进行斗争，因为这些人试图确保思想上的垄断等等。很明显，这首先是对苏联共产党以及对国际工人运动的露骨的攻击。这种攻击的目的是要确保每一个党有权以它自己的特殊的方式来对马克思主义进行评价、有权凭它自己的意愿来解释马克思主义，其他各党对这个问题没有过问的余地，同时，南共则为自己保留了就所有其他各党的思想和活动发表声明、作出判断的全部权利，并且自以为完全有权认为只有它的思想和活动才是正确的。
    文章说，首先必须驳斥把这次国际会议的讨论和决议说成是要把任何见解或理论“强加”于任何一个党的说法。参与起草和签署莫斯科宣言的各个党，没有一个党是“被迫”参加筹备工作的，没有一个党不是在表示同意之后才通过这个宣言的。怀疑这一点，就是丝毫没有根据的诬蔑。对于制造纷乱的无耻谰言必须加以驳斥。我们确信，资本主义各国的所有共产党之所以赞同莫斯科宣言，不是像国际反动派的愚蠢诽谤所说的那样，是因为有人把某一决定“强加”于它们，而只是因为它们的见解相同。南共纲领草案起草人没有权利怀疑这一基本事实，没有权利不具体指明而恬不知耻地怀疑兄弟共产党。谁也不会强使南共或任何一个共产党违背它的信念来听命于共产党人的一次国际会议。没有任何理由要一个党违背自己的信念而在思想和政治问题上同意一次国际会议的决议。但是极其重要的是：各国兄弟共产党通过交流和探讨各自的经验、通过在理论上讨论可能发生的分歧，从而在有关国际形势、国际工人运动和建设社会主义的根本问题上，不断加强思想和政治方面的一致。为此，必须进行双边会谈，在各党之间作出共同的决议，各兄弟党之间举行会议以便进行更广泛的磋商来作出决议。
    在国际共产主义运动的发展过程中，可能有这样的时期：由于像第二次世界大战年代那样的非常局势，或者像1949年后产生的那种不健康或不正常情况，如上述的广泛磋商即告中断。但是共产党人的任务，并不是依据已成过去的不正常情况来得出若干“规律”，而是要通过双边或更广泛的磋商、通过作出共同决议，来保证加强各兄弟党之间的合作，以使不正常状态不再出现。况且，共产党的任务不是对共产党人的任何一个“国际会议”散布怀疑，不是把这种怀疑提升为一个纲领性论点和理论性论点，而是要就原则性分歧进行兄弟般的讨论来消除怀疑。不论哪一个党，如果它扬言国际共产主义运动应该放弃这种国际合作的高级会议、放弃不断加强思想和政治上的统一，它就必然会使自己处于孤立，但是它不可能阻止国际共产主义运动加强团结。
    文章说，南共发表的纲领草案一经各国共产党充分研究以后，立即引起了尖锐的原则争论。争论的特点是本着同志式的帮助精神，坚决保卫马克思列宁主义的基本原则，坚决驳斥对莫斯科宣言的思想和政治攻击。所有的批评都一致保卫了莫斯科宣言、反对了南共纲领草案对它的攻击，并且指出了南共纲领草案的严重的反马克思主义的错误。所有的共产党当它们看见某一个党在思想上和实际政策上表现出严重的原则性错误时互相提出警告，是它们的权利和国际主义义务。这种同志式的警告、对南共纲领草案的原则性批评，是怀着帮助的意图的。可惜，这种同志式的批评没有得到适当的效果。纲领草案中针对苏联和社会主义阵营的一两段不正确的论述被删改和缓和了，但是基本的反马克思主义的错误保留下来了。而且代表大会上的报告和讨论还对这些错误加以发挥。他们用激烈的攻击来回答同志式的批评，并且怀疑各兄弟共产党是否有权把南共纲领草案当作一个批评的目标。他们说这是“对南共内部事务的干涉”。关于纲领草案的报告（卡德尔做的）对裁判别人的权利和他们自己的思想的不可侵犯性作了如下的解释：“当我们在一切有利于和平和社会进步的地方为团结和合作而斗争时，我们并不放弃思想斗争，并不放弃对机会主义、改良主义、教条主义、修正主义等等的批判。适应于我们的这种立场，我们将拒绝任何干涉我们事务的企图。我们不容许人们把外来的观念强加于我们。”这是一种什么样的“适应”呀！一方面给南共批评任何人的权利，另一方面又否认别的党有权批评南共的纲领，而且恰好正是在这个文件中体现了“改良主义、教条主义、修正主义等等”。自然，决定是否注意这些批评，是否改正兄弟党认为是错误的反马克思主义的论点，还是坚持这些论点并利用不正确的指责和“中伤”政策来答复原则性的争论，这是南共自己的权利和责任，任何人既没有权利、也没有办法来代替南共就南共的事务作出决定。但是，每一个兄弟党有权来密切注意南共的决定和活动，并形成自己对它的看法，无论是单独的或是共同的。
    硬说批评者想把“外来的观念”“强加于”南共，从而躲避各兄弟党的善意的本着帮助精神的保卫团结和合作的原则基础的批评。我们无论如何也不能认为这是正确的。
    南共第七次代表大会不能从兄弟党的原则批评中得到好处，而批准了充满着危险错误的纲领。代表大会上所作的报告和所进行的讨论的精神、内容、语调以及所通过的纲领，引起了各国共产党进一步的尖锐批评。“人民日报”在南共代表大会之后所发表的众所周知的社论指出，在最近这次南共代表大会上“更提出了系统的完整的修正主义纲领”。
    “真理报”5月9日的文章说明了铁托同志在代表大会上的报告中关于国际工人运动、特别是关于社会主义阵营和苏联的政策所发表的十分错误的、不公正的、异常令人气愤的言论的站不住脚的性质，并且驳斥了这些言论。
    文章说，让我们举一个例子，来说明“真理报”文章和在此以前发表的“共产党人”杂志的文章是有分寸的。这两篇文章没有提到一个非常奇怪的事实：南共纲领草案第四章谈到了并分析了南斯拉夫的反法西斯解放斗争，其中对苏军在南斯拉夫的解放中所起的作用却完全不提。光荣的苏军在英勇的南斯拉夫游击队合作下所进行的著名的贝尔格莱德战役，是第二次世界大战中最光辉的战斗事件之一。这次战役是苏军反对希特勒的伟大解放斗争中的一个重要的组成部分。在这次战役中和这次战役后，苏联人民的许多儿女为了南斯拉夫人民的自由而付出了自己的生命。南共现在通过了这末一个纲领草案，它分析了南斯拉夫的解放战争，但对苏军直接在南斯拉夫领土上进行的伟大战斗的事实和其意义却避而不谈。“真理报”和“共产党人”都没有指责这一点，而仅限于就与当前形势有关的最重要的问题提出批评。可是南共纲领一方面避而不谈苏军在南斯拉夫的战斗，一方面又大谈他们1948—1954年的争论和南斯拉夫所受到的伤害。的确，别的社会主义国家是使南斯拉夫受了伤害，但是从那时以来，我们已经澄清了这些，并且已经把它们消除了。南共第七次代表大会又把这一些拿出来了，而且弄得似乎是南共自己从未犯过任何错误，似乎它的一切方面都是正确的。换句话说，南共领导集团并未借助于在苏共倡议下所产生的1955年的贝尔格莱德宣言，来勇敢地检查自己的观点，纠正自己的错误。很遗憾，南共领导集团不这样做。这仅是力图从南斯拉夫所受的伤害中捞取政治资本，同时也从这一伤害的消除中得到了好处。
    各兄弟党的批评完全有理由地指出，1956年当匈牙利修正主义猖狂的时候，南共领导集团支持它并且打起了“反斯大林主义”的旗帜，而且当时的形势正是国际反动派利用并夸大对斯大林的错误所作的揭发，对国际共产主义运动发动了全面进攻。南斯拉夫这时又把对苏联的“中伤政策”拿出来了，而在这以前已经向苏联请求了广泛的经济援助，并且已得到了这种援助。南共第七次代表大会就是这么一种做法。
    至于匈牙利社会主义工人党，去年年初，我们同南共的关系的特点是在反革命和战胜反革命暴乱问题上的观点分歧。后来，我们的党重新组织起来并且巩固了，工人政权加强了，政治形势的巩固在我们的政策基础上实现了、而且是出乎意料的迅速。从此以后，我们的争论停止了，我们两国间的关系改善了。我们曾希望社会主义阵营各国的共产党和南共之间的关系，也会在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上得到根本改善。南共不参加社会主义各国党的会谈，这自然不能加强我们的这种希望，但我们还是曾经认为这只是暂时的后退。但是，南共第七次代表大会表明，情报局1948年的决议基本上正确地指出的重大原则分歧还存在着，甚至在1949年到1954年不正常的时间里，这种分歧还增长了。文章指出，这些分歧妨害着社会主义阵营各国同南斯拉夫之间发展起建设社会主义的各国间不仅可能而且必须具有的亲密而友好的关系来。为共同的思想而斗争的人们的真正友谊，真正的兄弟团结的基础，只能是原则性的政策，只能是马克思列宁主义的原则性政策。
    文章批判了南共第七次代表大会对国家资本主义趋势的修正主义估价和对资产阶级国家性质的重新估价。文章指出，卡德尔在代表大会上的报告没有说明有哪一个资本主义国家由于垄断资本所批准了的国家资本主义趋势而使其资产阶级的国家独立于垄断资本之外了。如果南共纲领的起草人至少提出一两个资本主义国家，认为它们的“蓬勃发展的国家资本主义趋势”证明了这些资本主义国家正在“不可阻挡地”和“深深地进入社会主义时代”，如果他们指出这些资本主义国家的名字，那么这些国家的共产党显然会用很重要的事实来向南斯拉夫同志们说明南共所理想化了的国家资本主义趋势究竟证明了什么。
    文章说，许多人认为，把资本主义国家中的国家资本主义趋势理想化，对资本主义国家机器的增长着的经济作用抱幻想，仅仅是瘫痪着资本主义国家的工人运动的发展，仅仅在那里对这些观点作斗争是重要的，只有在那里对这些错误观念和幻想的斗争才是反改良主义斗争的一个重要组成部分。我们的经验表明，在建设社会主义的国家中散布这种观点也会成为模糊社会主义自觉的危险手段。纳吉的修正主义宗派在他们的宣传中也利用了这一点。纳吉认为，人民民主国家是资本主义性质的民主国家，其中收归国有的工业、企业和银行等等不能组成国民经济的社会主义成分，而只是国家资本主义成分。这种国家资本主义的工业成分和农民的小商品生产成分，将会通过“民主的道路”、不需要无产阶级专政、“在农民方面也不需要合作社运动”的情况下进入社会主义。据他看来，无产阶级专政不是必需的。“教条主义者”才主张必须建立它。在1947—1949年匈牙利劳动人民党中央委员会的会议上所进行的“可惜是秘密进行的”争论中，纳吉退让了，但是后来又回到原来的地方了。1953—1954年则完全地回到了原来的地方。他在1955—1956年秘密写作和散发的文章，以及最后他在反革命期间的公开的完全的背叛，都赤裸裸地表明了用这一论点引起对国家资本主义的幻想曾经是修正主义者制造混乱的“思想”武器之一。他们促使被他们弄昏了头脑的人们接受资本主义复辟，就使用过这个武器，使用过“更民主一些的”、不要无产阶级专政的“匈牙利社会主义道路”的口号。这使纳吉之流的修正主义者们走上了恢复资产阶级政党、向资产阶级政党完全屈服、协助白色恐怖的可耻的道路。对我们来说，更加惊人的是，南共第七次代表大会把同纳吉之流所散布的国家资本主义幻想一样的幻想，当成了纲领条文。而这些幻想已经完全表明：如果没有充分的思想反击，它们就是为反对无产阶级专政的反动事业服务的。
    文章在指出国家资本主义的幻想在匈牙利是对资产阶级复辟服了务的事实以后说：我们认为我们有责任提醒南斯拉夫同志们注意这一点，社会主义各国的慷慨的兄弟援助，特别是苏联的武装援助，不仅使我们能够迅速地战胜了匈牙利的反革命，而且，省得南斯拉夫和南共在反革命在匈牙利占上风后，在法西斯的匈牙利看到企业变成资产阶级国家所有财产后作为国家资本主义成分那样深深地进入“社会主义时代”。
    文章接着批判了南共对社会主义世界体系和社会主义阵营问题的看法。文章说，南共对两种世界体系的存在制订出了它的特殊观点，南共不愿意知道社会主义世界体系的“地理”事实，否认社会主义世界体系是许多国家组成的体系。同样地，他们也否认资本主义世界体系的“地理”事实，也就是说，否认资本主义国家也形成了一个许多国家组成的体系。南共代表大会接受了一种论点，认为资本主义的和社会主义的世界体系是作为两种“社会过程”存在的，不是互相在国家上分立着而是互相拥抱着。的确，在资本主义国家中，也有社会主义的“社会过程”；在建设社会主义的国家中，资本主义的“社会过程”也还没有消失，南共只愿意知道这一点，把这一点宣布为两种互相拥抱着的“世界体系”。但是，资本主义世界体系作为许多国家组成的体系是个事实。不管南共承认与否，否认这个事实显然是同上述的一种观念有联系的，即认为资本主义国家不必脱离资本主义世界体系也可以“深深地进入社会主义时代”，或者说，这是同关于国家资本主义趋势的修正主义观点有紧密联系的。社会主义体系作为许多国家组成的体系也是一个历史事实，它的建立是当代的最伟大的历史成就。否认两种世界体系作为许多国家组成的体系的存在，就等于不顾事实。这是现代修正主义的最有代表性的和应该坚决驳斥的论点之一。
    这种修正主义论点，可以从“理论”上说明南斯拉夫为什么不愿意同别的社会主义国家建立一个共同的兄弟阵营。我们应该知道、而且事实上也知道了南斯拉夫是站在外面的，因为他们已经这样决定了。如果说别的社会主义国家都愿意同南斯拉夫建立同样的兄弟团结的话，那么南斯拉夫是否继续站在外面，就完全看它自己怎样决定了。过去和现在都没有任何人强迫南斯拉夫作出另一种决定，但是，南共也不能强迫任何人接受其反马克思主义的观点，或叫别人知而不言。我们知道南斯拉夫站在外面的事实，但以站在外面作为提出彻底修正主义的理由和对社会主义阵营各国进行不正确的指责，我们是要驳斥的。
    南共纲领指责社会主义阵营国家之间存在着不是建立在平等基础上的兄弟关系，较强的国家即苏联使其他国家“服从”于它，侵犯了其他国家的独立自主，而其他社会主义国家却甘心于这种“从属关系”。南共领导人说只有他们才是代表着各国平等和独立的事业的。然而，以诬蔑社会主义阵营国家来保卫“独立”的方式，不是别的，正是民族主义的表现和对无产阶级国际主义思想的粗暴的侵犯。尽管他们屡次宣扬南斯拉夫脱离社会主义阵营是真正的国际主义，诬蔑社会主义阵营是有助于旨在瓦解社会主义阵营团结的阴谋的。如果这种宣传得逞而不给以适当的回击，南共的虚伪的指控自然就会鼓舞帝国主义战争集团和社会主义国家内部的反动势力。
    1956年的匈牙利事件清楚地表明：诬蔑社会主义阵营以及社会主义阵营的领导国家——苏联，使国家脱离社会主义阵营、脱离与苏联兄弟同盟的阴谋，只有利于资产阶级复辟势力的黑暗计划。组织消灭无产阶级政权的纳吉之流的修正主义者们，也是利用歌颂南斯拉夫“处于阵营之外”、试图使匈牙利脱离社会主义阵营而进行资产阶级复辟的。同任何诬蔑社会主义阵营的危险进行斗争，应当看作是我们特殊的职责。我们强调提醒匈牙利工人阶级以及国际工人运动对这方面的注意。
    社会主义各国在相互关系中曾经有过混乱。错误应该纠正，但是办法并不是用它来拒绝社会主义阵营，而是要加强社会主义阵营。避免诬蔑社会主义阵营是南斯拉夫的国际主义义务。如果不放弃诬蔑，如果继续对那些在观点上同莫斯科宣言一致而不是同南共的观念一致的社会主义国家的独立表示怀疑，如果想继续走对社会主义阵营进行不正确的指责的道路，那么他们将会阻塞住这些国家同南斯拉夫的友谊继续发展的道路。即使这样，社会主义阵营也将进一步加强。在对匈牙利反革命的共同斗争的火焰中，在反对全体国际反动派猖狂诬蔑运动的共同斗争中，无产阶级的国际团结和在这种思想下团结起来的社会主义阵营锻炼得更坚强了。我们希望随着社会主义世界体系的进一步发展而来的是社会主义阵营同南斯拉夫的友好关系的改善，但是这有一个不可缺少的条件，即南共领导集团应当把对社会主义阵营的谩骂完全转交给帝国主义者去作，这是他们的“专业”。的确，只有当南斯拉夫积极反对社会主义阵营各国特别是苏联的时候，西方大国的宣传家们和政客们才“承认”南斯拉夫是独立国家。反之，如果日益增长的一致和进一步的接近代替了观点上的分歧和争论，他们就会喊叫南斯拉夫“屈服了”。我们认为，南共不能允许任何人代表南共对社会主义阵营各国实行类似的策略、对拒绝南共的奇怪观点而接受莫斯科宣言的各国共产党实行类似的策略。
    接着，文章批判了南共的修正主义国家理论中有关社会主义的国家的部分。文章说，各兄弟党的批评和我们在“社会评论”上的批评文章，都批驳了关于社会主义的国家的“极权主义”的歪曲论点，批判了社会主义的国家变成反动的、阻碍进步的力量的论点。当纳吉集团成为反革命集团的一部分、在反革命暴乱的思想准备中起重要作用时，它也散布了这样的观点。
    南共对其他社会主义国家提出“国家极权主义”的歪曲的指责，把南斯拉夫的国家却宣扬为克服了“国家极权主义”的危险的表率，它还把国家消亡的问题提到日程上来，并且朝这个方向实行了巨大的变动，用“社会自治”来代替国家。
    社会主义的国家同一切以前的国家不同的特点，是它不是少数人而是大多数人的国家。人民的国家是人民反对少数被剥夺了政权的剥削者的政权机关，所以社会主义的国家不是脱离社会的，不是超于社会之上的政权，而是广泛吸收各阶层人民来参加处理社会和国家事务的政权，列宁正是在这个意义上把社会主义国家称为“半国家”，因为脱离社会和超社会的现象正在消失。众所周知，当国家是进行统治的少数剥削者的政权机构时，那么这种脱离是不可避免的。如果我们要谈“社会自治”的话，应该肯定社会主义的国家是“社会自治”的最高形式。
    我们认为，轻视国家作用以及南共关于国家消亡的新理论，是不正确的，是危险的。社会主义的国家不得躲避它在建立和不断发展集中指导下的社会主义计划经济上所应负的责任。如果本着“社会自治”的精神削弱了社会主义经济的计划性，以及削弱了集中领导，这就会成为严重困难和错误的泉源。
    南共中央委员会在今年2月份研究了在南斯拉夫政治经济和社会生活中的消极现象，同时写了一封信给党员群众，号召对这些消极现象作斗争，这封信指出在中央和地方机关中、包括“社会自治”机构在内，都存在着官僚主义倾向。信中说：“建设和投资的狂热，使一些地方机关和企业领导机关中的企业领导者们除了自己的需要和狭隘的利益外，几乎是什么别的东西也看不见了”。信中指出，出现了特权主义思想和沙文主义倾向、“特别是在经济生活”中出现的原因，大部分在于“小资产阶级民族主义知识分子的残余”所散布的影响。这封信还指出，存在着无政府主义、拉私人关系、浪费和其他消极现象，并号召为克服这一切而进行顽强的斗争。
    应该指出，南共纲领所奉如神圣的理论，正是为上面所提到的消极现象的一部分保证了思想基础。在我们看来，南共和南斯拉夫国家的领导者们，对一部分消极现象只是对其表现进行斗争，但没有充分揭发出这些现象的最主要根源是：轻视国家的集中指导作用，把“社会自治”机构与中央国家机构对立起来，以及削弱中央国家机构的经济职能和帮助散布特权思想、沙文主义和无政府主义现象的理论。现在这种理论已经变成纲领性的条文了。
    卡德尔在代表大会上的报告中，关于国家的消亡作了如下的论述：“我们至今的实践表明，国家的职能首先是在经济、教育文化和社会服务方面开始缩小，而国家的镇压作用，‘国家作为劳动人民的权力工具的作用’，则缩小得较少。”但是马克思主义的国家理论教导说，社会主义国家消亡的道路是一方面国家的镇压作用逐步消失，另一方面国家的经济文化职能发展起来，最后是国家机构作为政权机构转变为组织和指导社会经济和其他事物的管理机构。共产主义不是各种无政府主义协会的松懈的联合，换句话说，不是“社会自治”团体的松懈的联合，而是最高级的、科学地组织起来的有领导的计划经营制度，通向这个目标的道路不是削弱国家的经济职能，而是要发展这种职能，包括使集中指导完善化，不断发展中央经济机构和地方经济机构的合作和分工。不论我们怎样说“社会自治”机构将日益“接受”国家的经济职能，社会主义的国家及其领导者们，并不能逃避国家经济机构所负担的巨大任务的任何一部分，不能把经济领导方面的问题和困难的责任，推给非国家性的“社会自治”机构。
    这就是我们的立场。是接收其中的一些什么呢？还是弃绝它？这是南共的主权，是否继续试验削弱国家的集中指导，而且首先是在经济生活方面试验，那是南共自己的事！但是，其他社会主义国家不跟随南共“国家衰退”的榜样，南共并没有权利诽谤它们是“官僚主义的、国家极权主义的国家”。
    文章最后说，如果一个社会主义国家的领导党不能及时摆脱它在基本的重要问题上所持的错误观点，那么尽管它有英勇的历史，它也会使无产阶级政权和社会主义事业在它的国家中陷入危险。
