    Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture
    Establishes First Universal Gas Tractor Station

    (Reported by this newspaper) On April 20th, in Baoshan County, Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, on the southwestern frontier of the motherland, the first tractor station of the autonomous prefecture was officially established.
    The characteristic of this tractor station is that all the tractors equipped are universal gas tractors manufactured by the Baoshan County Farm Implement Factory itself. This type of tractor uses coal or charcoal as fuel and can tow five-share plows, seeders, harvesters and other agricultural implements. At the same time, it can be used for transportation, and can also drive small generators to generate electricity, and drive motors to mill rice, grind flour, squeeze oil, pump water, etc., making it very suitable for rural use.
    This tractor station is equipped with a total of twelve such tractors with a total of more than 300 horsepower, equivalent to twenty standard tractors. The service area of the station covers more than 37,000 mu of land.

    德宏傣族景颇族自治州
    建立第一个万能煤气拖拉机站
    本报讯　在祖国西南边疆的云南省德宏傣族景颇族自治州保山县，4月20日正式建立了该自治州第一个拖拉机站。
    这个拖拉机站的特点是：全部配备的拖拉机都是保山县农具厂自己制造的万能煤气拖拉机。这种拖拉机用煤或木炭作燃料，可拖带五铧犁、播种机、收割机等农具，同时可带兜作交通运输，还可以带动小型发电机发电，带动马达碾米、磨粉、榨油、抽水等，很适合农村使用。
    在这个拖拉机站共配备了十二台这种拖拉机共计三百多马力，折合二十个标准台拖拉机。该站的服务区范围计三万七千多亩土地。
