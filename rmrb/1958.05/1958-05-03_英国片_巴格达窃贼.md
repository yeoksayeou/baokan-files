A British film, "The Thief of Bagdad."

This is a color fantasy film adapted from the stories of "One Thousand and One Nights." The content is rather ordinary, telling the story of a king and a princess who fall in love, endure hardship, and ultimately have a happy ending. However, the fact that the brave warrior, the Thief of Bagdad, who helps the king eliminate the treacherous villain, ultimately refuses to become a prime minister and prefers to live his free life, quietly leaving the king, is quite unexpected for the audience.

The magnificent colors, the scenery and customs of the ancient Arab country, and the wonderful special effects of the film all enhance the effect of this fantasy film. (De)

    英国片“巴格达窃贼”
    这是根据“一千零一夜”中的故事改编的彩色神话片。内容比较一般，是叙述国王与公主相恋，经过苦难最后大团圆的故事。但是，影片中那位协助国王除奸的勇士巴格达的窃贼，最后竟不作宰相，干愿过他的自由生活，悄悄地离开国王而去的情节，对观众来说却不能不是个意外。
    绚丽的彩色，阿拉伯古国的风物景色和奇妙的电影特技，都加强了这部神话片的效果。　（德）
