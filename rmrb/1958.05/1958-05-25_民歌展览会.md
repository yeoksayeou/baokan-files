    Folk Song Exhibition
    Guanchao Village in Chao'an County, Guangdong Province, held a folk song exhibition in early May. A total of more than 1,500 newly created, collected and compiled folk songs were exhibited. These folk songs were all created and collected by the commune members themselves. Among them, more than 200 songs were created and collected by women and children, and 36 songs were created and collected by commune members aged 50 to 80. Li Bating, a 63-year-old farmer, created three folk songs in one night, one of which describes the technical reform, breaking with conventions, and transplanting rice seedlings early. It vividly reflects the new look of the Great Leap Forward in the countryside. The folk songs exhibited this time were very popular among the masses. An old farmer said after visiting the exhibition, "Now that there is a cultural revolution, these folk songs are our good treasures."

    民歌展览会
    广东省潮安县鹳巢村在5月初举办了一个民歌展览会，共展出了新近创作、收集整理的民歌一千五百多首，这些民歌都是社员们自己创作和收集的。其中有妇女、儿童创作和收集的有二百多首，五十到八十岁的社员创作和收集的三十六首。六十三岁的老农民李拜亭，一天晚上就创作了三首民歌，其中有一首是叙述技术改革，打破常规，提早插秧的民歌，比较生动的反映了农村大跃进的新面貌。这次展出的民歌都很受群众欢迎，一位老农看了展览会说，“现在文化大翻身，这些民歌都是俺们的好宝贝”。
