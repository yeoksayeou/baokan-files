Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: Paris dispatch: De Gaulle, supported by French fascists, held a press conference in Paris yesterday, doing his utmost to encourage fascists to continue their coup plot.

The French Communist Party protested the government's permission for De Gaulle to hold such a press conference with a nature subversive of the republic, while prohibiting democratic forces from holding demonstrations to counter the fascist coup plot. At the time of De Gaulle's press conference, tens of thousands of workers in Paris and other parts of France responded to the call of the General Confederation of Labor and its local organizations, holding protest strikes. Subway and bus transportation in Paris, as well as suburban electric train traffic, were brought to a standstill. Metalworking workers and workers from other industrial enterprises in the Paris area stopped work. Workers from many factories and shipyards in Marseilles, as well as coal miners in the Berdounes region, went on strike. Construction workers, steelworkers, and workers in urban service industries in Le Havre also stopped work to hold rallies and establish anti-fascist committees.

At the press conference, in order to appease some political figures in France who opposed him, and to encourage them to compromise with the extreme right wing, De Gaulle emphasized that he neither wanted to overthrow the republic nor intended to be a "dictator." He also expressed "respect" for Socialist Party leader Mollet in particular, and called the former Minister Resident in Algeria, the Socialist Lagost, a "friend."

Although De Gaulle tried his best to appear "moderate," he could not suppress his strong animosity towards the constitution, which is the foundation of the republic. He called this constitution "a very bad constitution." He also stated that he wanted to become the head of the French government and to "obtain the extraordinary power to carry out an extraordinary mission in an extraordinary period" through "extraordinary procedures" on the issue of authorization by the National Assembly.

De Gaulle defended the fascist military riots in Algeria, praising the leaders of the French colonial army who participated in and led the riots for "doing a good job." He hinted that if he came to power, it could be "the beginning of a revival."

The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement yesterday regarding De Gaulle's remarks at the press conference. It pointed out that De Gaulle's speech showed that he "is the leader of the extreme right-wing elements, the person who instigated and led the Algerian rebellion plot. ... De Gaulle demanded that he be granted unlimited power through illegal and unconstitutional means. There is no doubt that he hopes to seize all power."

The Communist Party Political Bureau demanded that the government use special powers to relieve the rebel officers of their command positions, and demanded that the deputies who supported the rebels be stripped of their parliamentary privileges and that they be wanted.

The Socialist Party issued a communiqué stating that De Gaulle "rejected the constitution of the republic by wanting to obtain the power granted to him through a special procedure, the conditions of which would be determined by himself."

News has it that some bourgeois party members of the National Assembly have expressed a "good impression" of De Gaulle's attitude and are willing to consider De Gaulle leading the government as an "arbitrator."

The Pflimlin government decided to hold a meeting this morning to discuss what attitude to take towards De Gaulle's speech.

In Algeria, the all-Algerian "Committee of Public Safety," composed of fascists, was proclaimed on the evening of the same day that De Gaulle held his press conference.

Despite the very obvious relationship between senior generals of the French colonial army and the riots, the Pflimlin government has not taken a firm attitude towards these people. The Minister Resident in Algeria, Miot, and a spokesman for the Algiers "Committee of Public Safety" both admitted yesterday that Salan, commander of the French army in Algeria, still maintains contact with the Pflimlin government.

    戴高乐公开鼓动法西斯政变
    法国工人举行抗议性罢工
    法共斥责戴高乐企图独揽大权
    据新华社20日讯　巴黎消息：受到法国法西斯分子支持的戴高乐，昨天在巴黎举行了记者招待会，竭力鼓励法西斯分子继续进行政变阴谋。
    法国共产党抗议政府允许戴高乐举行这种具有颠覆共和国性质的记者招待会，同时却禁止民主力量举行反击法西斯政变阴谋的示威。在戴高乐举行记者招待会的时候，巴黎和法国其他地方的千千万万工人响应法国总工会及其地方组织的号召，举行了抗议性罢工。巴黎地下铁道和公共汽车以及郊区的电气火车交通，都陷于停顿。巴黎区的金属加工业工人及其他一些工业企业的工人，都停止了工作。马赛许多工厂和船坞的工人以及伯杜纳地区的煤矿工人，都罢了工。哈佛尔的建筑工人、炼钢工人和城市服务事业的工人，也纷纷停工集会，成立反法西斯委员会。
    在记者招待会上，戴高乐为了缓和法国某些政界人士对他的反对，并且鼓励他们同极右翼分子妥协，强调他既不想推翻共和国，也没有意思要做“独裁者”。他还特别对社会党领袖摩勒表示“尊敬”，并且把前阿尔及利亚驻节部长、社会党人拉戈斯特叫做“朋友”。
    戴高乐虽然竭力表示“温和”；但是始终压制不住他对于作为共和国基础的宪法的强烈敌意。他把这个宪法称为“一个很坏的宪法”。他还表示，他要成为法国政府的首脑，要在国民议会授权的问题上通过“非常程序”来“取得授给他在一个非常时期执行一个非常任务的非常权力”。
    戴高乐为阿尔及利亚的法西斯军事暴乱辩护，赞扬参加和领导暴乱的法国殖民军领袖们“做得很好”。他暗示，如果让他出来当政，那就可能是“复兴的开始”。
    法国共产党中央委员会政治局昨天就戴高乐在记者招待会上的谈话发表了声明。它指出，戴高乐的谈话表明他“是极右分子的首领，是怂恿和领导阿尔及利亚叛乱阴谋的人。……戴高乐要求通过非法和违反宪法的手段来授与他以无限权力。毫无疑问，他希望独揽大权。”
    共产党政治局要求政府运用特别权力来解除叛军军官的指挥职务，并且要求剥夺支持叛军的议员们的议员特权和通缉他们。
    社会党发表了公报，指出戴高乐“想要取得那种通过由他自己来确定其条件的特殊程序而授予他的权力，从而拒绝了共和国宪法”。
    有消息说，国民议会某些资产阶级政党议员竟表示对戴高乐的态度有“良好的印象”，愿意考虑戴高乐以“仲裁人”身份领导政府。
    弗林姆兰政府决定在今天上午举行会议，来讨论对戴高乐的谈话采取什么态度。
    在阿尔及利亚，由法西斯分子组成的全阿尔及利亚“救国委员会”，已经在戴高乐举行记者招待会的当天晚上宣告成立。
    尽管法国殖民军的高级将领同暴乱的关系非常明显，弗林姆兰政府还是没有对这些人采取坚决态度。阿尔及利亚驻节部长缪特和阿尔及尔“救国委员会”发言人昨天都承认，驻阿尔及利亚法军司令萨兰仍然同弗林姆兰政府保持接触。
