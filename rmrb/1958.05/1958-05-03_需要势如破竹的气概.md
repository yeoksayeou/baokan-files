    The Need for an Irresistible Force
    Wan Xiangxin
    There have always been two distinctly different attitudes towards the great leap forward in industry and agriculture. One is full of confidence, full of energy, breaking through all kinds of difficulties with an irresistible force, and forging ahead courageously; the other is doubtful, reluctant, and wants to retreat at the slightest difficulty.
    These two different attitudes can be clearly seen in the process of developing local industry.
    After the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of developing both industry and agriculture, and developing both central industry and local industry, some people once emphasized that local industry faced many difficulties in terms of funds, technology, and equipment, and doubted whether county and township cadres and the masses could run industry. However, the actual situation was contrary to their expectations. The broad masses of cadres and people in various places responded to the Party's call and vigorously developed local industry with an overwhelming momentum. In just a few months, many places have begun to see a new situation of "machines ringing everywhere, factories all over the cities and countryside." In the process of large-scale development of local industry, some new problems have also emerged: for example, some products have conflicts between cities and counties, there are some duplicate waste in manpower and materials, and the supply of some raw materials is relatively tight. At this time, some people came out to comment again: "Isn't this a mess?" "What should be done with the old factories if new factories are built on a large scale?" They advocated reducing the scale, slowing down the speed, and restricting the development of local industry. However, other comrades are full of energy to overcome difficulties and continue to promote the rapid advancement of local industry.
    Where do these two completely different attitudes come from? There are two main keys: one is the understanding of the essence and the mainstream, and the other is the grasp of the main contradictions. People who hold a promoting attitude believe that the large-scale development of local industry enables industrial production to take local materials, supply nearby, and support agricultural production and the development of large-scale industry in a timely and effective manner, improve people's lives, and at the same time make the industrial output value rise rapidly, so that the national economy can step on a steed and run towards national industrialization and agricultural mechanization at the fastest speed. This is grasping the essence and the mainstream. They see this clearly, and then have the courage to promote the great leap forward of local industry with unyielding perseverance.
    Comrades who hold a promoting attitude not only pay attention to grasping the essence and the mainstream of things, but also do not relax the research on non-essential and secondary things. Due to the large-scale development of local industry, the old balance in industrial production, supply and marketing has been broken, and some new contradictions will naturally arise between cities and counties, between urban and rural areas, and between certain economic departments. Due to lack of experience, some areas inevitably have some uncoordinated phenomena in the planning and construction of local industry. This is what some people call "chaos." In fact, this is not chaos, but only a new contradiction that has emerged in the current industrial development. That is: local industry is developing rapidly, and the balancing work has not kept up. Faced with the brand-new topic of developing central industry and developing local industry at the same time, the emergence of this contradiction is very natural. Comrades who hold a promoting attitude have studied the new problems in the development of local industry, grasped the current main contradictions, and then prescribed the right medicine: strengthen balance and cooperation. The Guizhou Qiannan Prefecture's arrangements for the division of labor and cooperation in running industry at all levels and departments reported in this newspaper on April 26, and the Zunyi Prefecture's method of combining points and surfaces, combining popularization and improvement to promote the joint leap forward of municipal industry and county industry published today, are all good ways to solve this problem. The comrades in these areas have adopted new methods in the face of new contradictions, so the industry in these areas can continue to develop at a rapid pace.
    To do revolution and construction, we need to have an irresistible force everywhere. The maintenance of this kind of spirit lies in the fact that people must be able to master objective laws, be good at seeing the essence and the mainstream of things, and be good at grasping the main contradictions. One of the root causes of those who do not work hard and always want to retreat is that they do not understand this truth and have not learned this skill. They need to study, and they need to go deep into reality and the masses to exercise.

    需要势如破竹的气概
    万向辛
    对待工农业跃进，一直有两种明显不同的态度。一种是信心充沛，干劲十足，以势如破竹的气概冲破各种困难，勇往直前；另一种是疑疑惑惑，勉勉强强，稍遇困难就想打退堂鼓。
    在发展地方工业的过程中，就可以清楚地看到这两种不同的态度。
    党中央提出工农业并举、发展中央工业和发展地方工业并举的方针以后，有人曾经强调地方办工业在资金、技术、设备方面困难很多，怀疑县、乡干部和群众能办工业。但是，实际情况和他们的预料相反，各地广大干部、群众响应了党的号召，以排山倒海的气势大办地方工业。时间仅仅几个月许多地方已开始出现了“机器到处响，工厂遍城乡”的新局面。在大规模发展地方工业的过程中，也出现了一些新问题：如市、县之间的某些产品发生了矛盾，人力、物力方面有某些重复浪费，有的原料供应比较紧张等等。这时候，又有人出来议论了：“这么搞，不就乱了吗？”“大建新厂，老厂怎么办？”他们主张缩小规模，降低速度，限制地方工业的发展。然而另外有些同志却是干劲充沛地克服困难，继续促进地方工业奔腾向前。
    何来这样两种截然不同的态度？主要关键有二：一是对本质和主流的认识，一是对主要矛盾的把握。抱促进态度的人们认为，地方工业的大规模发展，使工业生产更能就地取材，就近供应，及时有力地支援了各地农业生产和大工业的发展，改善了人民生活，同时使工业产值飞快上升，使国民经济跨上千里马，以最快的速度奔向国家工业化和农业机械化。这就是抓住了本质和主流。他们看清了这一点，便有勇气以百折不回的毅力去促进地方工业的跃进。
    抱促进态度的同志既注意把握事物的本质和主流，同时也不放松对非本质、次要的东西的研究。由于地方工业的大发展打破了工业产供销方面的旧的平衡，市县之间，城乡之间以及某些经济部门之间，自然会出现一些新的矛盾。由于缺乏经验，有些地区在发展地方工业的规划和建设中，也难免会出现某些不够协调的现象。这就是某些人的所谓“乱”。其实这并不是什么乱，只不过是当前工业发展中新出现的一个矛盾。这就是：地方工业在飞速发展，平衡工作还没有跟上来。面对着发展中央工业与发展地方工业同时并举这一崭新的课题，这种矛盾的出现是很自然的。抱促进态度的同志研究了发展地方工业中的新问题，抓住了当前的主要矛盾，于是对症下药：加强平衡协作。4月26日本报报道的贵州省黔南地区对各级、各部门办工业分工协作的安排，今天发表的遵义地区用点面结合、普及与提高相结合的办法促进市工业和县工业共同跃进，都是解决这一问题的好办法。这些地区的同志在新的矛盾面前采取了新的方法，因而这些地区的工业就能继续以一日千里之势向前发展了。
    干革命，搞建设，处处需要有势如破竹的气概。这种气概的保持，在于人们要能掌握客观规律，善于看到事物的本质和主流，善于抓起主要的矛盾。那些工作不起劲，时时想打退堂鼓的人的病根之一，就在于不懂得这个道理，没有学会这套本事。他们需要学习，更需要深入实际深入群众去锻炼。
