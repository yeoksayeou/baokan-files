    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The unpopular US Vice President Nixon was greeted with insults when he arrived in Lima, the capital of Peru, on the 7th. People "welcomed" him with placards reading "Nixon, Go Home!"

    The tactless guest presumptuously offered to give a report to students at San Marcos University the next day. When Nixon arrived at the school gate in an open car, he was stopped by two thousand angry students. Some students even threw stones at Nixon and his entourage. Reports say that Nixon's aide, Jack Sherwood, had a tooth knocked out by a stone, and Nixon himself was grazed on the neck by a stone.

    Nixon had to cancel the visit and flee in disgrace. (The picture shows his embarrassing moment when he jumped into the car. The banner behind him reads: "Nixon, Go Home!")

    When Nixon returned to his hotel, about a thousand demonstrators gathered near the hotel, chanting: "Peru is not for sale!"

    In San Martin Square, demonstrators tore off the American flag from the wreath that Nixon presented to the Peruvian national hero San Martin. (Picture attached)

    秘鲁人民教训美帝国主义
    尼克松在利马挨揍
    据新华社讯  不受拉丁美洲人民欢迎的美国副总统尼克松7日到达秘鲁首都利马的时候就挨了一顿臭骂，人们抬着“尼克松，滚回去！”的标语牌“欢迎”了他。
    这位不知趣的客人第二天又自作多情地要向圣马科斯大学的学生作报告，当尼克松坐着敞篷汽车到达学校门口时，就被二千名愤怒的学生拦住。有些学生并且向尼克松一行抛掷石子。有消息说，尼克松的副官杰克·薛伍德被石子打掉了一个牙齿，尼克松本人也被石子擦破了脖子。
    尼克松只好取消这次访问，狼狈而逃。（图片就是他逃上汽车时的尴尬相。后面标语是“尼克松，滚回去！”）
    在尼克松回到他的旅馆时，又有一千名左右示威者聚集在旅馆附近，他们高呼：“秘鲁不是供出卖的！”
    在圣马丁广场，示威者撕掉了尼克松献给秘鲁民族英雄圣马丁的花圈上的美国国旗。（附图片）
