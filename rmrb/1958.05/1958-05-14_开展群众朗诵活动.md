　　Launch Mass Recitation Activities

    The Beijing Mass Recitation Meeting held at the Tianqiao Theater on May 11th achieved great success.

    The vast majority of the programs were exciting.

    The reciters were workers, farmers, and students. They all performed naturally and skillfully, able to understand the thoughts and feelings of the works well. Most of the recited works were created by the masses themselves.

    Some works that were more difficult to recite were unexpectedly successful. For example, Comrade Guo Xiaochuan's "Deep Valley," which is hundreds of lines long, is a long poem that unfolds the entire plot through the conversation of two female comrades. Huang Qizhu, a female worker from the Platform Machine Tool Factory, handled it very appropriately. She was not only able to carefully convey the characters' thoughts and feelings in different situations and encounters, but also made discerning cuts to the long poem to suit the recitation. Collective recitation is more difficult to handle. The collective recitation of "Song of Labor, Friendship, and Leap Forward" by students from Peking University and the collective recitation of "Echoes of the Valley" by students from the Forestry Institute received lasting applause from the entire audience. Their common characteristics were naturalness and majestic momentum, especially the seamless transitions, which fully demonstrated each person's strengths while integrating them into a whole, with both scenery and emotion, which was very moving. There was only one satirical poem program. Wang Zongqi from the Nationalities Institute recited "You're Too Spoiled" and "You're Too Arrogant," and the satire of affectation and arrogance was just right. The recitations of two farmer comrades attracted all the listeners, they were so calm, so vivid. For example, Zhang Xiang from the Dahuangzhuang No. 11 Agricultural Cooperative recited "A Day of Releasing Water," which not only showed the joy and passion of farmers' labor, but also gave people a sense of being there. The recitation of prose, such as "Party Membership Dues" recited by Xie Wenzhi from the Children's Hospital, and "Summons of Life" recited by Zhong Bingzhao from the Dongsi Post Office, touched the audience with clear language and deep emotion.

    From the perspective of the entire program, praising the Great Leap Forward was the center. Therefore, thanks to the reciters' skillful techniques, this recitation meeting became a bugle call for the Great Leap Forward.

    One cannot help but see that behind this recitation meeting, there are tens of thousands of people enthusiastically carrying out amateur recitation activities. They love literature and recitation so much, and many experienced reciters have emerged among them, creating many new recitation forms and recitation methods.

    Beijing is like this, and I think other cities will be as well.

    The recitation of literary works is the most convenient and fastest way to promote socialist ideology, encourage the building of socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and encourage the sustained and unremitting maintenance of revolutionary vigor. It does not require props, sets, or a stage, nor does it require the collaboration of many people. It is also a very effective way to cultivate the working people's interest in and appreciation of literature.

    If our professional literary and art troupes and literary and art workers make use of the convenience of going to factories and rural areas to provide guidance to the mass recitation activities, that would be even better. Judging from the situation of the Beijing Mass Recitation Meeting, I feel that helping them select materials, or making appropriate modifications to the works they have selected, will make the recitation effect even better.

    The holding of the Beijing Mass Recitation Meeting will undoubtedly promote the mass recitation activities in Beijing. Let us all promote mass recitation activities so that factories, agricultural cooperatives, government agencies, and schools in various places can hold recitation meetings of all sizes. This is not only conducive to boosting morale and building socialism, but also to enlivening cultural and recreational life.

　　开展群众朗诵活动
　　沙鸥
    5月11日，在天桥剧场举行的北京市群众朗诵会，取得了很大的成绩。
    绝大部分节目都是激动人心的。
    朗诵者是工人、农民和学生。他们都表现得自然而熟练，能很好地体会作品的思想、感情。朗诵的作品又大半是群众自己创作的。
    有些比较难朗诵的作品，也出人意料地得到成功。如郭小川同志的“深深的山谷”，长达数百行，长诗又是通过两位女同志的谈心而展开全部情节；朗诵者台型机床厂的女工黄綮珠却处理得十分得体，她不但能仔细地传达出人物在不同的情况及遭遇中的思想感情；为了适合朗诵，她对长诗的删节也很有分寸。集体朗诵是比较难处理的。北大同学集体朗诵的“劳动、友谊、跃进之歌”和林学院同学集体朗诵的“山谷的回声”，得到了全体听众经久不息的掌声。他们的共同特点是自然，气势雄伟，特别是在交接的地方不显痕迹，能充分发挥每个人的特长，又能融合为一个整体，有景有情，十分动人。讽刺诗只有一个节目，民族学院的王宗琪朗诵的“你太娇”与“你太傲”对娇气、傲气的讽刺，恰到好处。两位农民同志的朗诵，吸引了所有的听众，他们是那样从容，那样的有声有色。如大黄庄十一农业社的张祥朗诵的“放水的一天”，不但表现了农民劳动的喜悦与激情，更给人身临其境的感觉。散文的朗诵，如儿童医院的谢文炽朗诵的“党费”，东四邮局的钟秉昭朗诵的“生的召唤”，都以清楚的语言和深沉的感情打动了听众。
    从整个节目来看，歌颂大跃进是中心。因此，这个朗诵会由于朗诵者的技巧熟练，就成了大跃进的一支号角。
    不能不使人看到，在这个朗诵会的背后，有成千上万的人热情洋溢地在开展着业余的朗诵活动。他们那样热爱文学，热爱朗诵，他们之中出现了许多有经验的朗诵者，创造了许多新的朗诵形式与朗诵方法。
    北京如此，我想其他的城市也会如此。
    文学作品的朗诵，从宣传社会主义思想，鼓动多快好省建设社会主义，鼓动持久不衰地保持革命干劲说来，是最方便的、也是最快的一种形式了。它不要道具，不要布景，不要舞台，也不需要许多人的协作。在培养劳动人民对文学的兴趣、欣赏方面说来，也是很有效的一种方式。
    我们的文艺专业团体和文艺工作者，如果利用下厂、下乡之便，对群众的朗诵活动给予辅导，那就更好了。从北京市群众朗诵会的情况看来，我感到帮助他们选材，或者对他们所挑选的作品，作适当的加工，朗诵的效果就会更好。
    北京市的群众朗诵会的举行，无疑地会推动北京的群众朗诵活动。我们都来提倡群众朗诵活动，使各地的工厂、农业合作社、机关和学校，都能举行大大小小的朗诵会。这既有利于鼓足干劲建设社会主义，又能活跃文娱生活。
