    Greatness Comes from the Ordinary
    ——Who is the Most Inventive Person in History?
    Master Craftsman Lu Ban
    Lu Ban was a famous and ingenious craftsman in ancient China. Although he came from a class considered lowly at the time, he dared to create. He invented many production tools and built many bridges, pagodas, temples, and pavilions. It is said that the Zhaozhou Bridge in Hebei Province, the Jingzhou Pagoda, and the bronze Bodhisattva of the Dafosi Temple in Zhengding all have legends related to him. It is said that the saw, the "Ban Mu" on the ink line, and the wooden wedge "Ban Qi" used when planing wood were all invented by him. He also built wooden kites (wooden birds) that could fly and siege ladders for attacking cities. Therefore, even today, carpenters, bricklayers, blacksmiths, stonemasons, and other workers in our country all respectfully call him "Master Ancestor." Lu Ban has become an ideal figure of the working people in folk legends.
    Lu Ban's surname was "Gongshu" and his given name was "Ban." He was a native of the State of Lu during the Spring and Autumn Period; that's why people call him Lu Ban. He apprenticed with an old monk, and later became a carpenter and mason. Many of his skills and technological inventions were researched and developed while he was working as a carpenter and mason.
    Studying While Farming
    Huangfu Mi was a famous acupuncturist of the Jin Dynasty. He studied very hard when he was young. Huangfu Mi's family was very poor, and he had to farm the land himself, but he never gave up learning because of this. He studied and researched whenever he had free time. Because of his diligence, he later wrote many books himself, and he was also very famous in the literary world at the time. He was very dissatisfied with the civil wars of the ruling class at the time and refused Emperor Wu of Jin's invitation to become an official.
    Huangfu Mi suffered from rheumatism in his middle age. Due to the pain of the disease, he was determined to study medicine himself. After he extensively read medical books, he finally wrote the "A-B Classic of Acupuncture." This book describes physiology, pathology, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention ideas, and details the theory and methods of acupuncture, the distribution of acupoints, as well as contraindications and indications. This "A-B Classic of Acupuncture" not only made great contributions to domestic acupuncture, but also greatly influenced foreign acupuncture. For example, the acupuncture of Japan, Korea, and France was introduced from our country, and all the positions of the acupoints are the same as those in the A-B Classic.
    Monk - Civil Engineer
    Huai Bing was a native of Zhending, Hebei Province, in the Song Dynasty. He became a monk from an early age. The social status of monks was not highly valued at the time, but Huai Bing became an outstanding civil engineer.
    There was a thirteen-story wooden pagoda in Zhending. Because it had been in disrepair for many years, the main pillars in the middle level were rotten and tilted. Ordinary craftsmen did not dare to contract the repair because it was too difficult. Huai Bing went to the site on his own initiative, measured the dimensions, made a pillar, and tied it to the pagoda. Then he crawled into the pagoda, closed the pagoda door, and replaced the broken pillar in a short time.
    There was a Xiaoshui River Bridge near Zhending, which was built in the Sui Dynasty. By the end of the Song Dynasty, because the people were struggling to make a living, many people dug iron from the bridge to sell. As more and more iron was dug out, the bridge also became tilted. According to calculations, it would take more than a thousand people to straighten the bridge, but Huai Bing restored the bridge to its original shape without using any labor. As for the method he used at the time, it is no longer possible to verify it.
    Born of a Poor Peasant Family
    Weapons Manufacturer
    Sun Wei was a famous weapons manufacturer in the Yuan Dynasty. The "Hoof Tendon Feather Root Armor" he created could block the penetration of arrows.
    Sun Wei was born into a poor peasant family. Because his hometown, Hunyuan, was ruled by the Jin people at the time, he once enlisted as a Jin soldier and later transferred to the Yuan army. Because he had been in battle for a long time, he felt that the armor he usually used was not strong enough. After repeated and painstaking research, he created the "Hoof Tendon Feather Root Armor." At first, Genghis Khan did not believe in the effectiveness of this "armor," but after he personally conducted a shooting test, it indeed could not be pierced.

    伟大出于平凡
    ——从历史上看谁是最能发明创造的人
    工匠祖师鲁班
    鲁班，是我国古代有名的巧匠。他虽是一个出身于当时被认为卑贱阶层的人，但是却敢于创造。他发明创造过不少生产工具，修过许多桥梁、宝塔、庙宇和楼台。现在河北省的赵州桥、景州塔、正定大佛寺的铜菩萨……都有同他有关的传说。据说锯子、墨线上的“班母”、刨木料时用的木橛子“班妻”等，都是他发明的。他还造过能飞的木鸢（木鸟），和攻城用的云梯。因此，直到今天，我国的木匠工人、泥瓦工人、铁匠、石匠等工人，都尊称他为“祖师爷”。鲁班成为民间传说中劳动人民的一个理想人物。
    鲁班，姓“公输”名“班”，春秋时候的鲁国人；所以人们叫他鲁班。他拜一位老僧做师傅，后来就一直当木瓦工。他的许多手艺，许多技术发明，都是在当木瓦工的时候钻研出来的。
    一面耕地一面研究学问
    皇甫谧是晋代的著名针灸学家。在他幼小的时候，就很用功读书。皇甫谧的家里很穷，他必须自己耕地，但是从来不因此而放弃学习，只要一有闲空就读书，研究学问。由于他的勤学不倦，后来自己也著了很多书，在当时的文学界也很有名。他对当时统治阶级的内战非常不满，拒绝晋武帝请他去作官。
    皇甫谧中年的时候，得了风湿症。由于疾病的痛苦，他便发愤自己研究医学。当他博览医书之后，终于写成了一部“针灸甲乙经”。在这本书里，叙述了生理、病理、诊断、治疗和预防思想等，详述了针灸疗法的理论、方法，经穴的分布，以及禁忌和适应症等。这部“针灸甲乙经”，不但对国内的针灸学有很大的贡献，就是国外的针灸学，也受他很大的影响。如日本、朝鲜、法国的针灸学，都是由我国传入的，所有经穴的部位也和甲乙经相同。和尚——土木工程师
    怀丙是宋代河北真定人，从小就作了和尚，和尚的社会地位，在当时并不怎么被重视，但是怀丙却成了一个杰出的土木工程师。
    真定有一座十三级的木塔，因为年久失修，中级大柱腐坏而倾斜，一般工匠都因为难于修理不敢承包。怀丙便自动前往，量好尺寸后，作了一根柱子，把它捆到塔上。然后钻进塔里，关上塔门，没有多久就把坏柱换下来了。
    真定附近有一个洨河桥，是隋朝时候修建的，到了宋末，因为民不聊生，许多人就去挖掘桥中的铁来卖，铁被挖多了，桥也变倾斜了。根据计算，如果要把桥扶正，需要一千以上的人力，但是怀丙却没有用工役而恢复了桥的原形。至于他当时用的什么方法，现在已无从查考了。
    贫农出身的
    兵器制造师
    孙威，是元代有名的兵器制造师。他创造的“蹄筋翎根铠”，能够阻挡弓箭的射入。
    孙威出身贫农家庭，因为当时他的家乡浑源属金人统治，曾经应募当金兵，后来又转到元军中。由于他久经战斗，感到平时所用铠甲不够坚固，经过一再刻苦地琢磨后就制成了“蹄筋翎根铠”。起初成吉思汗还不大相信这种“铠甲”的作用，经过他亲自射击试验，果然不能射穿。
