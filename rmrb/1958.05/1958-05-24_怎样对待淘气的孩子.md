How to Treat Naughty Children
    Lü Fang

    When children learn to walk and run, everything they see, whether in the yard or in the house, is new and exciting. They touch, look, run, jump, and play; they are always so active. As the saying goes, "Around one and a half years old, they're always touching pots or cans." This vividly illustrates the active nature of a one-and-a-half-year-old child.

    It is good that children are innocent and lively. However, some parents, when they see their children jumping around, often scold and blame them, as if being active were the child's fault. The result of this kind of education is not to cultivate the child's lively, active, and courageous spirit, but to train them to be as still as a wooden chicken. Although they are very "well-behaved," they lack the ability to live independently.

    There are also some people who, when they see their children making a mess, often indulge and tease them, saying things like "Children aren't afraid of being naughty; the naughtier they are, the more promising they will be." This kind of indulgence and pampering also cultivates many bad habits in children, such as willfulness and stubbornness.

    Still others have the wrong attitude. They fall somewhere in between. When they are happy, the child is so adorable that they are amused by any amount of mischief; when they are unhappy, they chase the child out of the room, trying to "get them out of sight and out of mind," letting the children "rebel" in the streets. Then, when the child develops some bad habits, such as rudeness, they attribute it to an inherently bad temper.

    So, how should we treat children's "naughtiness"?

    You need to know that children have initiative. If you carefully observe some so-called naughty children, you'll find that they simply have more initiative in life and activities than other children. Obviously, this initiative should not only be cherished, but we should also be good at developing the child's valuable spirit of initiative.

    Sometimes, children are naughty mainly because they don't understand things; they don't understand what is good and what is bad. For example, two-year-old Duo Duo put his mud doll in a basin of water to bathe it, intending to help, but ended up making a complete mess. In this case, scolding the child severely, or giving him a beating, will not solve the problem. This is because Duo Duo just thought it was fun and didn't expect such serious consequences. At this time, even if the adults are a little angry, they can only patiently tell the child: the doll is made of mud and cannot be washed; it will break if you wash it, and you can't mess around like this in the future.

    Of course, genuinely naughty behavior should not be exempted from reprimand; at the same time, it's also wrong to think that after a child makes a mistake, there is no need to provide advice or education, simply waiting for the child to realize their mistake on their own. For example, if a child plays with fire without permission, adults should not only stop them immediately, but also, in connection with daily life, tell the child in advance about the dangers of playing with fire, so that children are alerted and avoid making mistakes.

    Educating children requires patience, and dealing with naughty children requires even more patience. On the one hand, pay attention to observing their performance in daily life; on the other hand, pay attention to studying the causes of their naughtiness, and based on these causes, study methods of education.

    Usually, we do a very poor job in this area. First, we don't understand the child; we don't know what their strengths and weaknesses are. Second, we don't understand the cause of the child's naughtiness. Seeing a child being naughty makes us irritable and impatient, and we treat naughty children differently, adding harsh words, which results in the child forming a special feeling—I'm just like this anyway; I'm always bad.

    In fact, the root cause of a child's naughtiness is that the child is energetic but often has nowhere to vent it. As the saying goes, "Children's hands and feet are never idle," they always want to play with something, do something, and put all their energy into it. Experienced parents often develop and support this initiative in children and guide their activities to be in line with educational goals. For example, four-year-old Xiao Fang is extremely active and seems interested in everything. His mother often reminds him: "It's time to eat; wash your hands and pass out the chopsticks to everyone"; when it's time for bed, she guides him to tidy up the bed. She also helps him come up with other forms of activity, such as asking him to build a "big train"; asking him to help adults fetch something; letting him sing for everyone, and so on. In short, she uses some reasonable activities to fill their free time.

    When dealing with naughty children, attention should be paid to many aspects. Cherishing children's initiative and guiding children's activities in accordance with educational goals is an important method for dealing with naughty children. But at the same time, we must not neglect to suppress some of the child's unreasonable demands. Correctly handling this contradiction becomes a central issue that should be constantly considered in educating children.

    怎样对待淘气的孩子
    吕方
    小孩子学会走路了，会跑了，无论是在院子里，或屋子里，看见什么都是新奇的，东摸摸，西看看，跑跑跳跳，打打闹闹，永远是那么好动。俗话说：“周半，周半，不是摸盆，就是摸罐。”这句话很形象地说明了一岁半的小孩好动的情景。
    小孩子天真活泼，这本是好的。可是，有些做父母的看到小孩子活蹦乱跳时，往往?喝他，责骂他，仿佛好动就成了孩子的过错。这样教育的结果，不是培养孩子的生动、活泼和勇敢的精神，而是训练他们呆若木鸡，虽说很“乖”，就是没有一点独立生活的能力。
    也有些人，当他们看到小孩子胡打乱闹时，常常在一旁纵容他、逗他，说什么“小孩子不怕淘气，越淘气越有出息。”这样纵容和娇惯的结果，也养成了小孩子任性、固执等许多坏脾气。
    再有一种人的态度也是不对的。他们是介乎二者之间，自己高兴的时候，孩子是如此可爱，以致无论怎样淘气都使他们高兴；自己不高兴的时候，就把孩子从房间里轰出去，企图“眼不见心不烦”，让孩子们到街道上“造反”去。等孩子养成一些粗野等坏习气后，又归之于天生的脾气坏。
    那么，应该怎样对待孩子的“淘气”呢？
    要知道，小孩子是有主动性的。如果你仔细观察一下某些所谓淘气的孩子，他们也不过是比一般的孩子在生活中、活动中更多一些主动性。显然，对于这种主动性，不仅应该珍视，而且应该善于发扬孩子可贵的主动精神。
    有时候，小孩子淘气主要是因为不懂事，不懂得什么是好，什么是坏。例如，两岁的多多把泥娃娃放在水盆里洗澡，他一片好心帮忙，结果弄得一榻胡涂。在这种情况下，对孩子大加申斥，或痛打一顿，都不能解决问题。因为小多多只觉得好玩，并没料到有这么严重的后果。这时大人虽说有点生气，但也只能耐心地告诉孩子：娃娃是泥的不能洗，一洗就坏了，以后不能再这样乱搞。
    当然，对于孩子真正淘气的行为，并不是一律不能加以申斥；同时也不能错误地认为，孩子犯了错误，事先事后不必进行说服教育，而净等孩子的自觉。例如，小孩子随便玩火，大人看到了，不仅当时应该严加制止，更重要的是结合日常生活把玩火的危险性事先告诉孩子，使孩子们有所警惕，避免少犯错误。
    教育孩子要有耐心，对待淘气的孩子更要有耐性，一方面注意观察他在日常生活中的表现；另一方面注意研究造成淘气的原因，根据这些原因，研究教育的方法。
    通常在这个工作上，我们作的往往是很差的，一是不了解孩子，不清楚孩子本身究竟有哪些优点，哪些缺点；二是不理解造成孩子淘气的原因是什么。看见小孩子淘气，就心烦意燥，因而对淘气的孩子另眼看待，恶语相加，结果使孩子形成一种特殊的感觉——反正我就这样了，总是我不好。
    其实，形成孩子淘气的根本原因，就是小孩子的精力充沛而时常无处发泄。常说：“小孩子是手不闲脚夹”，总想玩点什么，干点什么，而且鼓起全副精力来作。有经验的父母常常是发展和支持孩子们这种主动性，并指导他们的活动合乎教育的目的。例如，四岁的小方爱动极了，对什么都好像有兴趣，母亲时常提醒他：“吃饭了，洗洗手，把筷子发给大家”；睡觉了，还指导他整理好床铺。平时还帮他想出了其他形式的一些活动，如请他搭个“大火车”；叫他帮大人拿点东西；让他唱歌给大家听等等。总之，是利用一些合理的活动充实他们空闲的时间。
    对待淘气的孩子，要从多方面加以注意。珍视孩子们的主动性，根据教育目的指导儿童的活动，这是对待淘气孩子的重要方法。但同时也不能忽视抑制儿童一些不合理的要求。正确处理这种矛盾，就成为教育孩子经常应该考虑的一个中心问题。
