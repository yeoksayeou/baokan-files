　　Sugarcane and beet planting work is about to be completed smoothly. According to recent statistics from six major sugarcane producing areas in the south, including Guangdong, Fujian, and Guizhou, the sown area has reached more than 4.7 million mu; in the north, the beet planting area in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Inner Mongolia can reach more than 2.7 million mu. The total area of the two sugar crops exceeds the plan by more than 400,000 mu, an increase of more than 25% compared with the same period last year.

　　Planting in various places is generally one to two seasons earlier than in previous years. In Guangdong and Fujian, sugarcane planting was completed by the end of March this year. Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, which has always planted late, extended to April and May last year, but this year, sugarcane planting was completed as early as February. The masses said: "Planting a month early means a hundred more catties of sugar."

    甘蔗甜菜播种面积扩大
    本报讯　糖料作物播种工作即将顺利完成。根据最近南方广东、福建、贵州等六个主要甘蔗产区的统计，下种面积已达四百七十多万亩；北方黑龙江、吉林、内蒙古三地的甜菜播种面积可达二百七十多万亩。两项糖料面积合计，超过计划四十多万亩，比去年同期增加了25％以上。
    各地播种普遍比往年提早了一个到两个季节。在广东和福建，今年3月底即已结束了甘蔗下种工作。素来下种较晚的云南省元江县，去年曾延长到4、5月，今年则早在2月份，甘蔗即已下种完毕。群众说：“早种一月，糖多百斤”。
