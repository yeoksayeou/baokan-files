    Become a Working-Class Intellectual
    Shanghai Intellectual Circles Deeply Criticize Ideology and Strive for Redness and Expertise
    (Our newspaper's dispatch by correspondent Sun Zunian) Shanghai's intellectual circles are undergoing a profound ideological transformation through the trials of the "Double-Anti" movement and the great leap forward towards both redness and expertise.
    On this very day last year, the city was rife with talk of a wall or a gulf between intellectuals and the Party, and that the Communist Party did not value scientific and technological talent. Today, a new common language has emerged among intellectuals: to overcome bourgeois ideology in scientific research and teaching, to give our hearts to the Party, to dedicate our knowledge to the people, to become thoroughly red and deeply expert, and to strive to become working-class intellectuals as soon as possible!
    Shanghai's natural scientists took the lead in this "Double-Anti" movement, leading the way for all senior intellectuals. It was seventeen natural scientists in Shanghai who first proposed to become thoroughly red and deeply expert within five years. After issuing their proposal to the country, they immediately began to formulate individual plans for achieving both redness and expertise. The first characteristic of all these plans is the commitment to actively improve political and ideological awareness, striving to be leftists. They all plan to link scientific research with practice, serving the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, and striving to catch up with international standards within twelve years. Wang You, deputy director of the Institute of Organic Chemistry, planned to strengthen research on the organic chemistry of carbohydrates and antibiotics, especially to complete the study of the chemical structure of streptomycin and to continue in-depth research on the synthesis of streptomycin analogs related to the action of antibiotics in the amino sugar chemistry section. Gao Yisheng is determined to conduct in-depth research on antibiotic phytomedicines and drugs for treating cancer. Yao Xin aims to establish conditions for hormones, especially steroid hormones, within two years and to carry out research on hormones and tumors. Tang Yuwei aims to establish research on plant growth hormones within five years. These scientists' plans for redness and expertise have been discussed and compared among more than seventy senior researchers, promoting all scientists to develop their own plans for achieving both redness and expertise, as a direction for their efforts.
    Ideological Leap Forward, Orienting Towards Production, Eliminating Individualism, Sincere Collaboration
    Based on the evaluation of their plans for redness and expertise, Shanghai scientists have launched a comprehensive cooperation with production departments. Their slogan is: "Orient towards production, serve production, and welcome the technological revolution." The goal is to transform Shanghai into a modern industrial base for advanced products in chemical industry, precision machinery, instruments and meters, telecommunications equipment, small-sized steel, shipbuilding and repair, light textile industry, and various refined cultural products. The thirteen scientific collaboration groups, under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal People's Committee, have made preliminary plans for compiling the 1958 scientific research plan and the scientific research plan for the second five-year plan. The metallurgy, civil engineering and construction, aquatic products, and textile scientific collaboration groups have already confirmed most of the research projects planned for this year. The medicine and chemical engineering groups are discussing or reviewing the draft plan for this year through group activities. The mechanical and electrical ships, light industry, and agriculture collaboration groups are collecting and organizing materials, and some groups have begun preliminary review and grading discussions on research topics. The newly established electricity, mathematics, physics and mechanics, and biology groups are brewing research tasks and establishing groups. In studying scientific plans, the scientific research collaboration groups also fully exposed the bourgeois ideas of individualism, fame, and profit in past scientific research work, and affirmed that collaboration is a good way for scientific research to serve production and a concrete path for intellectuals to become both red and expert.
    Evaluating Plans, Self-Reform, Breaking Down and Building Up Simultaneously, Improving Teaching
    Following the proposals of the seventeen natural scientists, professors in various universities, after thirty-five professors and associate professors at Fudan University proposed to the country to "resolutely be revolutionaries in politics, innovators in academia, and promoters in teaching and scientific research," launched a wave of formulating plans, evaluating plans, and self-reform. During the evaluation of plans, professors further revised their plans, addressing their own shortcomings such as individualism, conservative thinking, bourgeois ideas in teaching and scientific research, arrogance, and sectarianism.
    Su Buqing, vice president of Fudan University and a renowned mathematician, and Professor Chen Chuanwei had been engaging in sectarianism and disunity since 1952, in developing teaching and scientific research, in the personnel allocation of the mathematics department, and in formulating the department's long-term plan. This bourgeois style directly caused great damage to socialist higher education. During this evaluation of plans, the two men examined their thinking with each other and talked for two hours, turning "knots" into unity. They firmly stated that they would defeat their arrogant and self-righteous sectarian sentiments, help each other, and run a socialist university well, as a starting point for transforming their thinking. Chen Guanlie, associate professor of industrial economics in the economics department, and Jiang Xuemo, associate professor of political economy, both formulated red and expert plans, and they accepted the correct opinions of the students, boldly innovated, and adopted new teaching methods. When Associate Professor Jiang Xuemo lectures now, he first assigns the topic and reference books, then allows the students to freely express their views, boldly exposing their own opinions, then focusing on debate, and finally summarizing himself, focusing on systematically and deeply teaching some theoretical issues on the issues that are generally present in everyone. This "teaching with a clear target" method is very helpful in improving the students' political and ideological level. The students are extremely interested in this and feel that what they learn in this way is solid and profound. In the past, when Associate Professor Chen Guanlie lectured in class, the students' note-taking was not very effective. Now, Associate Professor Chen Guanlie accepted the students' criticism, and with a serious and responsible revolutionary drive, changed the past conservative teaching methods, squeezing out time each week to write ten thousand words of lecture notes. A few days before the lecture, he first distributed the lecture notes to let the students preview, and also set aside a regular class each week for the students to preview, and guide them on the spot. Before class, he conducted a ten-minute quiz to urge the students to preview carefully, and to understand the students' degree of understanding from the quiz, and then explain and analyze it, and further develop the simple issues in the lecture notes. The students responded very well to this teaching method, and their attention was very concentrated during the class, which timely consolidated the teaching.
    Professors in the steam locomotive teaching and research section of Jiaotong University, through the evaluation of personal plans, criticized individualism and detachment from production practice in scientific research, and immediately revised the topic of scientific research on dynamic experiments, stepped up cooperation with the Technical Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, and quickly carried out experiments on burning pulverized coal in steam locomotives. In teaching, they accepted the students' suggestions and actively prepared a firebox for the students to learn how to add coal, so as to better conduct operational practice. Professor Cheng Hongbing of the vehicle teaching and research section also served as an instructor for a class, changing the past shortcomings of "only teaching but not caring about learning," to ensure that learning is applied to practical use. After the evaluation and debate of the red and expert plans, the Chinese, mathematics, and biology departments of East China Normal University were led by Zhao Shanqi, director of the teaching method teaching and research section of the Chinese department, and led 430 students to 150 agricultural middle schools and farmers' spare-time middle schools in the western suburbs of Shanghai to serve as teaching practice, and more than 20 teachers personally compiled teaching materials and guided the students' teaching practice. The professors said that they would cultivate talents who are both red and expert in practice, and at the same time transform themselves.
    Many professors in Shanghai universities deeply exposed the ugly ideas of bourgeois individualism through criticism and self-criticism. Yu ?, director of the Microbiology Teaching and Research Section of Shanghai Second Medical College, stated in a big-character poster that in the past, closed-door scientific research not only hindered personal improvement but also affected the growth of new forces. In the future, we must accept the painful lessons and make microbiology research face production. Gao Hongzhang, associate professor of Shanghai Fisheries College, had always regarded knowledge as private property in teaching, and was unwilling to show the young teachers his lecture notes; he always held back when training teaching assistants. This time, he expressed his determination to sever this ugly bourgeois individualism, truly hand over knowledge to the people, and achieve both redness and expertise.
    At present, Shanghai intellectual circles are deeply exposing and criticizing bourgeois ideology, thoroughly discrediting bourgeois individualism, resolutely moving towards thorough redness and deep expertise, and better serving socialist construction. (Attached picture)

    作一个工人阶级知识分子
    上海知识界深入批判思想奔向红专
    本报讯　记者孙祖年报道：上海知识界正经历着双反运动、又红又专大跃进的洗礼，思想上正在起着深刻的变化。
    去年的今天，正是满城风雨，说什么知识分子和党有墙有沟，共产党不重视科学技术人才等等；而今天，在知识分子中，已经有了新的共同语言：要克服科学研究和教学中的资产阶级思想，把心交给党，把知识交给人民，红透专深，早日成为工人阶级知识分子！
    上海自然科学家，在这次双反运动中，一马当先，走在所有高级知识分子的前头。首先倡议在五年内红透专深的，就是上海十七位自然科学家。他们自从向全国发出倡议后，立即分头订出了个人的红专规划。所有规划的第一个特点，就是要积极提高政治思想觉悟，力争做左派。他们都计划在科学研究上要联系实际，为工农业生产大跃进服务，争取在十二年内赶上国际水平。有机化学研究所副所长汪猷订出要加强研究碳水化合物和抗生素的有机化学问题，特别要完成链霉素的化学结构的研究，并继续深入氨基糖化学部分关于抗生素作用的链霉素的类似物的合成。高怡生决心深入研究抗生素植物药和治疗癌症的药物。姚錱在二年内争取建立激素，特别是类固醇激素的条件，开展激素与肿瘤的研究。汤玉玮要在五年内建立植物生长素的研究。这些科学家的红专规划，在七十多个高级研究人员中进行过讨论评比，并推动了所有科学家都订出自己红透专深的规划，作为努力方向。
    思想跃进　面向生产  打消单干　真诚协作
    上海科学家们在评比红专规划的基础上，开展了同生产部门全面大协作的局面。他们的口号是：“面向生产，为生产服务，迎接技术革命。”要把上海变成为化学工业、精密机械、仪表、电讯器材、小型钢材、船舶修造、轻纺工业高级产品、各种文化用品精制品等现代化工业基地。在上海市人民委员会领导下的十三个科学协作小组，对编制1958年科学研究计划和第二个五年计划科学研究规划，已经作出了初步打算。冶金、土木建筑、水产、纺织等四个科学协作小组，对今年规划研究的项目，大部分已经肯定下来。医药、化学化工两个小组正以分组活动讨论或复审今年度的计划草案。机电船、轻工业、农业等三个协作小组，正收集和整理资料，部分分组已开始进行研究课题的初审归级的讨论。最近刚成立的电力、数学、物理力学、生物等四个小组正在酝酿研究任务和建立分组。科学研究协作小组，在研究科学规划中还充分揭露了过去科学研究工作上单干、名利等资产阶级思想，肯定了协作，是科学研究为生产服务的好办法，也是知识分子红透专深的具体道路。
    评比规划　自我改造  边破边立　改进教学
    各高等学校的教授，随着十七位自然科学家的倡议，在复旦大学三十五位教授、副教授向全国倡议“坚决做政治上的革命派，学术上的革新派，教学科学研究工作中的促进派”以后，掀起了一个制订规划，评比规划，自我改造的热潮。在评比规划中，教授们针对自己的个人主义、保守思想、教学和科学研究中的资产阶级思想、骄傲自大、闹宗派等缺点，进一步修订规划。
    复旦大学副校长、著名的数学家苏步青和陈传玮教授，从1952年以来，彼此在开展教学和科学研究上，在数学系的人事配备上，在制订系的长远规划上，闹宗派不团结。这种资产阶级的作风，直接给社会主义高等教育带来莫大的损失。这次在评比规划中，两人互相检查思想，在一起畅谈二小时，化“疙瘩”为团结。两人坚决表示要打垮自高自大、自以为是的宗派情绪，要互相帮助，办好社会主义大学，作为改造思想的起点。该校经济系工业经济教研组陈观烈副教授、政治经济学教研组蒋学模副教授，因为制订了红专规划，他们都接受了学生的正确意见，大胆革新，采用新的教学方法。蒋学模副教授现在讲课，首先布置讲题和参考书，然后让学生们大鸣大放，把自己的看法大胆暴露出来，再着重进行辩论，最后自己总结，着重对大家普遍存在的问题，系统地深入地讲授一些理论问题。这种“有的放矢”的教学方法，对于提高学生政治思想水平有很大帮助。学生们对此极感兴趣，觉得这样学习到的东西才能巩固和深刻。过去陈观烈副教授在课堂上讲课，学生们记笔记效果不太好。现在，陈观烈副教授接受学生们的批评，拿出认真负责的革命干劲，改变过去墨守成规的教学方法，每星期挤出时间写一万字的讲义。在讲课前几天，先发下讲义，让学生们预习，并且每星期抽出一节正课让学生们预习，自己当场加以指导。上课前，先进行十分钟提问，督促学生们认真预习，并从提问中了解学生们理解的程度，然后再加以讲解和分析，并把讲义中简略的问题加以进一步发挥。学生们对这种教法反映很好，听课时注意力也非常集中，及时地巩固了教学。
    交通大学蒸汽机车教研组教授，通过个人规划的评比，批判了科学研究中的个人主义、脱离生产实际后，立即修订科学研究动力试验的题目，加紧与铁道部技术局协作，迅速进行蒸气机车燃用煤粉的试验。在教学上接受学生的建议，积极准备一台火箱，供学生们学习提煤之用，以便更好地进行运转实习。车辆教研组程鸿炳教授还担任一个班的指导教师，改变过去“只管教不管学”的缺点，保证做到学以致用。华东师范大学中文、数学、生物三个系，经过红专规划的评比和辩论后，由中文系教学法教研组主任赵善诒率领四百三十个学生到上海西郊区一百五十个农业中学、农民业余中学担任实习教学，还有二十多位教师亲自编教材和指导学生的教学实习。教授们表示，要在实际中培养又红又专的人才，同时改造自己。
    上海高等学校许多教授通过批评与自我批评，沉痛地揭露了资产阶级个人主义的丑恶思想。上海第二医学院微生物教研组主任余?在大字报上提出，过去关门研究科学，不仅阻碍了个人的提高，而且影响了新生力量的成长。今后一定要接受惨痛的教训，使微生物研究面向生产。上海水产学院副教授高鸿章在教学中一直把知识当作私有财产，不愿把讲稿给青年教师看；培养助教也总是留一手。这次表示一定要割断这种丑恶的资产阶级个人主义，把知识真正地交给人民，做到红透专深。
    目前，上海知识界正在深入揭发和批判资产阶级思想，要把资产阶级个人主义彻底搞臭，坚决走向红透专深，更好地为社会主义建设服务。（附图片）
