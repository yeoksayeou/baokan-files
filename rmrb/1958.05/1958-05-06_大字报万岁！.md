Long Live Big-Character Posters!
Wang Renzhong

Big-character posters are like bamboo shoots after the rain, like a hundred flowers blooming, a hundred birds singing. Go to any organization, enterprise, or school, and you can see a dazzling array of big-character posters. Big-character posters are also becoming increasingly common on city streets and in rural areas! We Communists are very happy to see these big-character posters, like standing beside the peach blossoms of East Lake, facing the beautiful morning glow, and welcoming the warm spring breeze, our hearts are so cheerful. The broad masses of people use the form of big-character posters to conduct sharp and pertinent criticism and self-criticism. Wuhan University calls the big-character posters of criticism "gifts." "A gentleman loves people with virtue." Well-intentioned criticism is indeed a precious gift; of course, we must accept it with gratitude! This is a manifestation of the socialist system's mutual assistance between people, this is the broad democracy and freedom of socialism. The right-wing elements once attacked our society as undemocratic and unfree. Have they ever seen such broad democracy and freedom in the old society and the Western world?! Through the anti-Rightist struggle, our broad masses of people have recognized the true faces of the right-wing elements. It turns out that they want to abolish the democracy of the proletariat and implement the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie—in fact, they are remnants of imperialism, feudalism, and Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang—they only want freedom to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism, and do not allow people to have the freedom to fight back, and do not allow people to have the freedom to support the Communist Party and support socialism. The rightist gentlemen are too bold, too arrogant, and overestimate themselves. Last spring, the right-wing elements used big-character posters to spread poison wantonly, stirring up a gust of evil wind. At that time, some wavering elements thought that "the sky was really going to change." In fact, as soon as the sun came out and the spring breeze blew, the evil wind was dispelled, and the right-wing elements, demons and monsters, one by one revealed their ridiculous ugliness! Big-character posters are a weapon. The rightists once used it to frantically attack the Party and socialism, and we also fully used this weapon to counterattack and encircle and annihilate the rightists. Facts have proved that this weapon, which is convenient for the broad masses of people to use, is unfavorable to the enemy and the rightists, and is most beneficial to our people. After the anti-Rightist struggle, we fully used the weapon of big-character posters to carry out rectification, especially since the Two Antis campaign, big-character posters have developed rapidly. Both in terms of quantity and quality, there has been great development and great improvement. The current trend is to further develop towards improving quality. The so-called quality of big-character posters refers to the content and form of big-character posters. The content of big-character posters includes not only the struggle against the enemy, but also the exposure of contradictions among the people, criticism and self-criticism among comrades, and also rationalization proposals, praise for advanced figures, and personal pledges. Cadres and the people, through big-character posters, dedicate their wisdom, enthusiasm, and determination to the Party and to the cause of socialist construction. In terms of style, there are letters, memorials, essays, cartoons, and poems. The most popular among the masses are cartoons and poems.
  The "Yangtze Literature" editorial department has selected and published more than 20 allegro poems from the big-character posters of factories and organizations. This is a very good practice. It is hoped that more poems created by workers and peasants will be published in the future. Our poets should humbly learn from the workers and peasants, not only to learn their firm will, heroic spirit, and revolutionary drive, but also to learn the healthy style and pure and vivid language expressed in their poems. Perhaps some people, after reading these poems from the workers and peasants, will slap the table and sigh or shake their heads and curl their lips, calling them low-level forms. Little do they know that this is precisely the foundation and main source of new poetry. The main thing for new poetry can only be to improve and develop on this basis (of course, it can also absorb the necessary essence from classical poetry). Some people must disagree with this view, and I welcome a discussion. I have also written a few crooked poems, but I always feel that they are not as vivid and powerful as the poems created by workers and peasants, and they are not easy to read aloud, and it is even more difficult to remember them. Many poems created by workers and peasants quickly spread among the local masses. They are easy to understand as soon as you read them, easy to learn as soon as you hear them, easy to read and easy to remember. May I ask our new poets, how many of the poems you have written are circulating among the masses?! I think it is better to abandon those "refined and elegant" works that are not welcomed by the masses and sing "popular songs" with the workers and peasants.
    I've wandered off topic, let me get back to the main point. The content of big-character posters is rich, and the forms are colorful, and cartoons and poems are the best forms in big-character posters! Big-character posters were born from the rectification movement last year, but they will never disappear with the end of the rectification movement. Big-character posters will definitely continue to develop; especially with the progress of the Chinese people's political thought, the improvement of their cultural level, and the high tide of socialist construction, the quality of big-character posters will be improved day by day. This kind of big-character poster, where everyone is an editor and everyone is a reader, will play a significant role in the political and economic life of the Chinese people. Therefore, we should shout: Long live big-character posters! (Originally published in Hubei Daily)

    大字报万岁！
    王任重
    大字报，像雨后春笋，像百花盛开，百鸟争鸣。走到任何一个机关、企业、学校，都可以看到琳琅满目的大字报，城市街道上和农村里大字报也日益多起来了！我们共产党人，看到这些大字报感到十分高兴，像站在东湖的桃林之旁，对着美丽的朝霞，迎着暖和的春风，心情那样舒畅。广大人民群众运用大字报的形式，进行尖锐而又中肯的批评与自我批评，武汉大学把批评的大字报，叫做送礼，“君子爱人以德”，善意的批评，确实是一种珍贵的礼物；我们当然要以感激的心情去接受她！这就是社会主义制度的人与人的互助关系的一种表现，这就是社会主义的广泛的民主自由。右派分子曾经大肆攻击我们这个社会不民主，不自由，难道他们在旧社会和西方世界看见过这样广泛的民主自由吗？！经过反右派斗争我们广大的人民群众认清了右派分子的真面目，原来他们是要取消无产阶级的民主，实行资产阶级的专政，——实际上他们是帝国主义、封建主义、蒋介石国民党的残余，——他们只要反共反人民反社会主义的自由，不准人们有反击的自由，不准人们有拥护共产党拥护社会主义的自由。右派先生们胆子太大了，太狂妄自大，太不自量力了。去年春季右派分子曾经利用大字报，大肆放毒，吹起了一阵妖风，当时，有些动摇分子以为真的要“变天”了，其实太阳一出来，春风一吹，那股妖风就被驱散了，右派分子，牛鬼蛇神，一个个露出了他们那可笑的丑态！大字报是一种武器，右派曾经利用它向党向社会主义猖狂进攻，我们也充分运用了这个武器向右派进行反击战和围歼战。事实证明，大字报这种便于广大群众使用的武器，对于敌人对于右派是不利的，对于我们人民是最有利的。反右派斗争之后，我们又充分运用大字报的武器进行整改，特别是自从双反运动以来，大字报有了迅速的发展，不论在数量方面还是质量方面都有很大发展，很大提高，现在的趋势是进一步向提高质量方面发展着，所谓大字报的质量，是指大字报的内容和形式，大字报的内容，不仅有对敌人的斗争，也有人民内部矛盾的揭露，有同志间的批评、自我批评，而且还有合理化建议，有对先进人物的表扬，也有个人的决心书，干部和人民群众通过大字报，把自己的智慧、热情和决心，献给党献给社会主义建设事业。在体裁方面，有书信、条陈、散文、漫画、诗歌，最为群众欢迎的是漫画和诗歌。
  “长江文艺”编辑部从工厂、机关的大字报中，选登出二十几篇快板诗，这是一个很好的作法，希望今后更多地发表工农群众所创作的诗歌。我们的诗人应当虚心地向工农群众学习，不仅要学习他们那种坚定的意志，英雄气概，革命的干劲，而且要学习他们在诗歌中所表现的健康的风格，和纯洁生动的语言。也许有人读了这些来自工农群众的诗歌，会拍桌长叹或者摇头撇嘴，称之为低级形式。殊不知这恰恰是新诗发展的基础和主要源泉，新诗主要的只能在这个基础上去提高去发展（当然从古典诗词中也可以吸取必要的精华），一定有人不赞成这种见解，我欢迎展开一番讨论。我也是写过几首歪诗的人，但是总觉得没有工农群众创作的诗歌那样生动有力，而且读起来不顺口，让人记住就更困难，工农群众创作出来的许多诗歌，很快地就在当地群众中流传开来。一读就懂，一听就会，好读好记。请问我们的新诗人，你写的诗有几首是在群众中流传着的呢？！我看还是放弃那些不为群众欢迎的“阳春白雪”来和工农群众一起歌唱“下里巴人”为好。
    扯远了，再收回来，大字报的内容丰富，形式多彩，漫画诗歌又是大字报中一种最好的体裁！大字报从去年整风运动产生，但是绝不会随着整风运动的结束而消灭，大字报一定会继续发展下去；特别是伴随着我国人民政治思想的进步，文化水平的提高和社会主义建设的高涨，大字报的质量将日益提高，这种大家当编辑，大家是读者的大字报，在我国人民的政治生活和经济生活当中将起着重大的作用，因此我们应当喊：大字报万岁！（原载湖北日报）
