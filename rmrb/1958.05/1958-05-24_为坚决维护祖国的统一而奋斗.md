    Strive to Resolutely Safeguard the Unification of the Motherland
    Bainqen Erdini

    It has been a full seven years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Today, the joy and excitement of us Tibetan people are beyond description. Since the liberation of Tibet, under the correct leadership and kind concern of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and with the sincere help of all comrades of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Tibet Military Region, the Tibetan people have not only been freed forever from the shackles of enslavement by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rulers, and returned to the warm embrace of the motherland's big family, fully enjoying the rights of ethnic equality and freedom of religious belief, but also gradually implementing the "Agreement on Measures for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet," thus creating an unprecedented prosperous new atmosphere in Tibet. The relationship between ethnic groups has become harmonious and friendly, the people's anti-imperialist and patriotic enthusiasm has been enhanced and heightened, industry, agriculture, culture, education, health, transportation and other undertakings have been rapidly developed, and people's lives have been initially improved. What is particularly exciting is that in April 1956, under the personal guidance of the Central Delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established, enabling the Tibetan people to exercise the right to be masters of their own affairs and better develop various undertakings in accordance with the situation and characteristics of their own ethnic group. This will play an active role in further enhancing the Tibetan people's anti-imperialist, patriotic, and socialist ideology, and accelerating the development of Tibet's political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings.

    Today, while warmly celebrating this festival, we deeply feel the warmth and loveliness of all ethnic groups in the united, friendly, and mutually cooperative big family of the motherland, and we see more clearly the brighter prospects for the future happiness of our Tibetan people. The iron facts of the past seven years prove that only in the big family of the motherland can the Tibetan people receive equal treatment and sincere, selfless assistance, and only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party can the Tibetan people get rid of the impoverished life left to us by imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionary rule and embark on the increasingly prosperous socialist road. Any other road cannot bring happiness to the Tibetan people. However, today there is still a small handful of pro-imperialist separatists who turn a blind eye to these achievements, do not accept the bloody lessons of history, repay kindness with hatred, and go against the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Instigated by imperialism, they betray their own ethnic group, constantly create rumors, and try to provoke ethnic relations, attempting to create division, betray the motherland, and betray the Tibetan people. Today, we must give these reactionaries a firm and powerful rebuff, completely crush them, and fully expose their hideous and ugly faces before the Tibetan people. Only in this way can we guarantee the victorious construction of a happy and prosperous new Tibet.

    There are also some people with local nationalist ideas who ignore the importance of all ethnic groups uniting in the motherland's big family, and remain content with the status quo. They ignore the importance of the Han people's help to minority ethnic groups, and they also ignore the importance of mutual help among the people of all ethnic groups. This is a manifestation of bourgeois ideology on ethnic issues, which is fundamentally unfavorable to the unification of the motherland and the unity of ethnic groups, and even more unfavorable to the prosperity and development of our Tibetan ethnic group, and at the same time, it is also unfavorable to the socialist construction of the motherland. As everyone knows, in the past, before liberation, due to the imperialist and Kuomintang reactionary classes adopting policies of ethnic oppression and bloody rule, ethnic estrangement existed; however, today, under the wise leadership of the Party, policies of ethnic equality have been implemented, and ethnic regional autonomy has been practiced. The various ethnic groups are closely united. This will powerfully promote the people of all ethnic groups to work together with one heart and one mind to jointly build a socialist motherland. Therefore, today we must not only resolutely oppose and criticize this incorrect thinking, but also further cooperate with cadres of all ethnic groups working in Tibet, especially Han cadres, to truly achieve mutual trust, mutual learning, mutual assistance, and mutual support, and further implement this spirit of unity, mutual assistance, and friendship into all aspects of life and work.

    In the future, we must unite even more closely under the victorious banner of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, further promote mutual assistance and unity between the Tibetan and Han nationalities, continue to expand and consolidate the anti-imperialist and patriotic united front, resolutely wage a tenacious struggle against separatists and retrograde elements, and at the same time, resolutely oppose and criticize local nationalism. In our work, we must continue to give play to the revolutionary spirit, tap potential, implement the principle of building the country and managing households with diligence and thrift, and in accordance with the general principle and general line of more, faster, better, and more economical, bring about a new atmosphere in all aspects of work in Tibet. We must, like the people of the whole country, use all positive factors to resolutely safeguard the unification of the motherland, establish a unified Tibet Autonomous Region as soon as possible, and strive to build a prosperous and happy new Tibet.

    为坚决维护祖国的统一而奋斗
    班禅额尔德尼
    西藏和平解放已整整七周年了。今天，我们西藏人民心情的快乐和激动是无法比喻的。自从西藏解放以后，西藏人民在共产党、毛主席的正确领导和亲切关怀下，在中共西藏工委和西藏军区的全体同志的真诚帮助下，西藏人民不但永远摆脱了帝国主义和国民党反动统治者的奴役枷锁，回到了祖国大家庭的温暖怀抱里，充分享受到了民族平等和信教自由的权利，而且逐步实行着“关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”，从而在西藏出现了空前未有的欣欣向荣的新气象。民族之间的关系融洽友爱了，人民反帝爱国热情增强和高涨了，工农业和文教卫生、交通运输等事业都有了迅速的发展，人民的生活有了初步改善，特别使人兴奋的是：于1956年4月，在以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团的亲临指导下，成立了西藏自治区筹备委员会，从而使西藏人民能够行使当家作主的权利，更好地按照本民族的情况和特点来发展各方面的事业，这将对进一步提高西藏人民的反帝爱国和社会主义思想，加速西藏的政治、经济和文化等事业的发展，起到积极的作用。
    今天，在热烈庆祝这个节日的时候，我们深深地感受到了各族人民在团结友爱、互助合作的祖国大家庭中的温暖和可爱，更显明地看到了我们西藏人民明天更幸福的远景。七年来铁的事实证明，只有在祖国的大家庭中，西藏人民才能得到平等的待遇和真诚无私的帮助，只有在共产党的英明领导下，西藏人民才能摆脱帝国主义和国民党反动统治时期给我们留下的贫困的生活，才能走向日益幸福繁荣的社会主义道路。任何其他道路都是不可能使西藏人民幸福的。但是今天还有一小撮亲帝分离分子，他们竟熟视无睹这些成就，不接受历史上血的教训，以怨报恩，和西藏广大人民背道而驰，在帝国主义唆使下，出卖自己的民族，经常制造谣言，多方挑拨民族关系，企图制造分裂，背叛祖国，背叛西藏人民。今天，我们必须对这些反动分子，给予坚决有力的回击，彻底粉碎他们，把他们狰狞的丑恶的面貌，完全揭露在西藏人民面前，只有这样才能保证我们胜利地建设幸福美满的新西藏。
    现在还有一些有地方民族主义思想的人，他们忽视了各民族团结在祖国大家庭里的重要性，故步自封，他们忽视了汉族对少数民族帮助的重要性，同时也忽视了各民族人民间互相帮助的重要性，这是资产阶级思想在民族问题上的表现，这是根本不利于祖国的统一和民族的团结的，更不利于我们西藏藏族的繁荣与发展，同时也不利于祖国的社会主义建设。大家知道，在过去未解放前，由于帝国主义和国民党反动阶级采取民族压迫的政策和血腥统治，民族隔阂是存在的；但是，今天，在党的英明领导下，贯彻了民族平等的政策，实行了民族区域自治，各民族之间是亲密团结的。这将有力地促使各民族人民和衷共济，共同建设社会主义的祖国。所以我们今天不仅要坚决反对和批判这种不正确的思想，要更进一步地和在藏工作的各民族干部特别是汉族干部真正做到互相信任、互相学习、互相帮助、互相支援，把这种团结互助友爱的精神进一步贯彻到生活和工作各个方面去。
    今后，我们必须更加紧密地团结在共产党、毛主席的胜利旗帜下，在藏、汉民族间更进一步的互助团结，继续扩大和巩固反帝爱国统一战线；坚决和分离倒退分子作顽强的斗争；同时要坚决反对和批判地方民族主义；在工作上，要继续发挥革命的精神，发挥潜力，贯彻勤俭建国、勤俭持家的方针，按照多、快、好、省的总方针，总路线，使西藏各项工作出现新的气象。我们要和全国人民一样，运用一切积极因素，为坚决维护祖国统一，早日成立统一的西藏自治区，和建设繁荣幸福的新西藏而奋斗。
