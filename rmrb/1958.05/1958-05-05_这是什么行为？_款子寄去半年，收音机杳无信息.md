    What Kind of Behavior Is This?
    Money Sent Half a Year Ago, No News of the Radio
    Last October, we remitted 317.40 yuan to Renji Radio Shop in Xincun, Puan Road, Shanghai, to order two radios by mail. Now, more than half a year has passed since the money was sent, but the radios have not been delivered. We have written three times to inquire, but their replies either say they will send them soon or that they have not yet bought the parts. It is not difficult to buy radios on the market now, and their replies are completely deceptive. During the rectification campaign, Renji Radio Shop in Xincun is still deceiving customers in this way. We hope that the relevant local authorities will investigate and deal with this.

    这是什么行为？
    款子寄去半年，收音机杳无信息
    去年10月间，我们给上海市普安路新村仁记无线电行汇去人民币三百一十七元四角，向他们函购两台收音机。现在款子已经汇出半年多了，收音机还没有寄来。我们曾三次去信追问，但他们回信不是说很快就寄，就是说还没有买到零件。现在市场上购买收音机并不困难，他们的回信完全是骗人。在整改期间，新村仁记无线电行还是这样欺骗顾客，希望当地有关机关调查处理。
