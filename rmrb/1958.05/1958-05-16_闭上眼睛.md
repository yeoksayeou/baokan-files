A dispatch from Touhutu, British North Borneo, reveals that the British authorities in British North Borneo are encouraging rebels in North Sulawesi, Indonesia, to smuggle large quantities of copra into North Borneo in exchange for gold, which they then use to purchase weapons in the Philippines. To this end, the British authorities have ordered customs officials to "close their eyes," pretending not to know about the smuggling of copra from North Sulawesi.

The British authorities are indeed very cunning. However, they have forgotten that while they can order their own customs personnel to "close their eyes," they certainly cannot order the people of the entire world to "close their eyes." The misdeeds of the British authorities have finally been exposed.

    “闭上眼睛”
    据英属北婆罗洲斗胡的消息，英属北婆罗洲的英国当局正在鼓励印度尼西亚北苏拉威西的叛乱分子私运大量椰干到北婆罗洲来换取黄金，再到菲律宾去购买武器。为此，英国当局命令海关职员“闭上眼睛”，装作不知道从北苏拉威西私运椰干入口的事情。
    英国当局的确是很狡猾的。然而，它忘记了，它虽然可以命令自己的海关人员“闭上眼睛”，但是毕竟不能命令全世界人民都“闭上眼睛”。英国当局干的坏事终于还是败露了。
