Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 21st. Sichuan Province has discovered abundant iron ore resources.

    Over the past few years, the Sichuan Provincial Geological Bureau has explored and confirmed iron ore reserves exceeding 470 million tons, available for formal mining design. In addition, it has also identified approximately 800 million tons of prospective iron ore reserves. Among the major iron ore deposits with confirmed reserves, some can be used to smelt large quantities of special steel, and some can be used to refine high-quality steel. The already proven large iron ore deposits are sufficient to meet the needs of building the largest iron and steel complex in the Southwest.

    In order to promptly supply iron ore resources to Chongqing Iron and Steel Company, the first medium-sized iron and steel complex in the Southwest, the Sichuan-Hubei Branch of the Geological Bureau of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also found many iron ore deposits on the border of Sichuan and Hubei and around Chongqing. Relatively high-grade iron ore has been found in Dianguan in Jianshi County, Hubei Province, and in Huoshaoping and Songmuping near Yichang.

    四川储铁八亿吨
    新华社重庆21日电  四川省已经找到了丰富的铁矿资源。
    四川省地质局几年来探明的可供正式开采设计的铁矿储量，在四亿七千万吨以上；另外还查明铁矿远景储量八亿吨左右。已经探得确切储量的几个主要铁矿中，有的可以用来大量冶炼特殊钢，有的可炼优质钢。已经探明的大铁矿，足够建设一个西南最大的钢铁联合企业的需要。
    为了及时供应西南第一个中型钢铁联合企业——重庆钢铁公司的铁矿资源，冶金工业部地质局川鄂分局，也在川鄂边界、重庆外围等地找到了许多铁矿。在鄂西建始县的店官、在宜昌附近的火烧坪、松木坪都找到了品位比较好的铁矿。
