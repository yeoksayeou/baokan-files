　　Raise Your Head to See the Red Moon Near, Turn Your Head to See the Setting Sun Slant
　　Liang Ruhuai
    The third red moon has made peace-loving people all over the world cheer loudly. It is truly a great piece of good news that adds brilliance to magnificence.

    1957 was a bad year for the Western world. In 1958, the situation did not make the imperialists any more optimistic. The economic crisis, like a demon that could not be shaken off, guarded the houses of Wall Street bosses. No matter how hard the President and Secretary of State screamed, they could not resist this misfortune. This is called being doomed.

    The East wind has prevailed over the West wind, and the East wind will continue to prevail over the West wind. This is the inevitability of historical development.

    Just take May, and the Western world probably won't be able to record many things worth celebrating in its annals.

    In this month: The Soviet government's proposal to hold a top-level meeting is becoming more and more popular. Western countries dare not openly refuse it, nor dare they seriously sit down at a round table to talk. They want to delay, but they can't delay it.

    In this month: China's socialist production upsurge continues to leap forward. The total output value of industrial enterprises from January to April increased by 26% compared with the same period last year. In May, the high tide of industrial and agricultural production was like ten thousand horses galloping, with flowers blooming everywhere.

    In this month: The Indonesian government forces gave a crushing blow to the foreign-backed rebel groups, thwarting the imperialists' attempt to collude with domestic Indonesian ambitious elements to revive their colonial dreams.

    In this month: The Middle East national independence movement is developing more vigorously. The flames of mass demonstrations in Beirut and Tripoli quickly spread throughout Lebanon. Angry masses burned down the United States Information Service.

    In this month: The American Vice President encountered a warmer reception in Latin America than he did in Asia a few years ago. Like a rat crossing the street, everyone shouted "Beat him!" Latin America responded to this night owl with bricks, stones, spit, garbage, and rotten fruit. American newspapers themselves had to admit that "the relationship between the United States and Latin America has reached its lowest point in twenty-five years, and the barometer is still continuing to decline."

    As luck would have it, on the same day that Nixon slipped back to Washington with a body full of contempt and curses from the Latin American people, the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite went into space amidst the cheers of hundreds of millions of people.

    The Soviet Union's new feat of launching an unprecedentedly large satellite to march into the universe cannot be compared with that street rat, but this coincidence also reflects a very clear contrast to some extent.

    The East wind is blowing across thousands of miles with the force of a bamboo splitting, and no one can stop it!

    Eisenhower said a self-righteous thing at a press conference on the 14th: "Where there is a lot of smoke, there is probably some fire." The meaning of this remark is nothing more than to attribute "the anti-American sentiment in various countries around the world" to "the fact that the Communist Party has a coordinated plan." This is a completely self-deceiving lie. Doesn't Eisenhower himself know where the smoke comes from and how the fire is generated? From the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, the Eisenhower Doctrine to military blocs such as the North Atlantic, Baghdad and Manila, from missiles, atomic weapons to the stationing of troops, what has been the result? Yes, there is indeed "some fire," and more than "some." This is the anger of the people of "various countries in the world." Under the strong and unstoppable East wind, this prairie fire will become more and more fierce and burn wider and wider.

    In the peaceful competition between the two systems, socialism will surely win. This is already a clear fact. Isn't the large satellite that travels in the high space of 1,800 kilometers and can be seen by raising one's head another new proof? Isn't it very clear that the imperialist camp is not only completely defeated politically, but also faces a looming economic crisis, and is also far behind in science and technology? No matter how anxiously the gentlemen of the Western world scratch their heads, get angry and fire up, or spread rumors with spittle splashing, they cannot reverse the decline of the West wind. It is precisely:
      Good dreams follow the flowing water, the East wind blows to hundreds of millions of homes,
      Raise your head to see the red moon near, turn your head to see the setting sun slant.

　　举头红月近，回首夕阳斜
　　梁汝怀
    第三个红色月亮使全世界爱好和平的人们高声欢呼。它真是个锦上添花的大喜讯。
    1957年是西方世界流年不利的一年。到了1958年，形势并没能使帝国主义者稍微乐观些，经济危机像怎么也摆不脱的魔鬼，就守在华尔街老板们的屋外，不管总统、国务卿力竭声嘶，也抵抗不住这场厄运，这叫做在劫难逃。
    东风已经压倒了西风，东风还将继续压倒西风。这就是历史发展的必然性。
    单说5月份吧，在西方世界的大事记上恐怕就记不上多少值得他们高兴的事。
    是月也：苏联政府召开最高级会议的建议越来越深入人心，西方国家不敢公开拒绝，也不敢认真地坐在一张圆桌边谈谈。想拖，也拖不了。
    是月也：中国的社会主义生产高潮继续向前跃进，1月到4月工业企业的总产值比去年同期增长了26％。到了5月，工农业生产高潮，更如万马奔腾，遍地鲜花。
    是月也：印度尼西亚政府军对外国支持的叛乱集团给以歼灭性的打击，挫折了帝国主义勾结印度尼西亚国内野心分子重圆殖民旧梦的企图。
    是月也：中东民族独立运动更加蓬勃发展，贝鲁特和的黎波里群众示威的怒火迅速烧遍全黎巴嫩。愤怒的群众烧毁了美国新闻处。
    是月也：美国副总统在拉丁美洲遭遇到比前几年在亚洲更为热烈的接待。老鼠过街，人人喊打，拉丁美洲用砖头、石子、唾沫、垃圾、烂水果回答这只夜猫子。美国报纸自己也不得不承认“美国和拉丁美洲之间的关系已经达到二十五年来的最低点，而且晴雨表还在继续下降中。”
    无巧不成书，就在尼克松带着一身拉丁美洲人民的唾弃和臭骂溜回华盛顿的同一天，苏联第三颗人造大卫星在亿万人欢呼声中上了天。
    苏联发射空前未有的大卫星这个向宇宙进军的新壮举，同那只过街老鼠自然不能相提并论，但这件巧合的事实却也多少反映了一个极其鲜明的对比。
    东风，横吹万里，势如破竹，谁也休想阻挡！
    艾森豪威尔14日在记者招待会上说了一句自作聪明的话：“有大量的烟，大概就有一些火。”这话的意思，无非是想把“世界各国的反美情绪”归之于“共产党有一个配合一致的计划”。这是十足的自欺欺人的谎话。难道艾森豪威尔自己还不清楚，烟是从哪儿来的，火又是怎么产生的吗？从杜鲁门主义、马歇尔计划、艾森豪威尔主义到北大西洋、巴格达和马尼拉等军事集团，从导弹、原子武器到驻军，结果又落得了什么呢？是的，确实是“有一些火”的，而且不止“一些”。这是“世界各国”人民的怒火。这股燎原烈焰，在强烈的、势如破竹的东风之下，它将越来越猛，越烧越广。
    两个体系的和平竞赛，社会主义一定取得胜利。这已经是摆得明明白白的事实了。那颗遨游于一千八百公里高太空之上、举头就能看到的大卫星，难道不又是一个新的证明吗？帝国主义阵营不仅在政治上一败涂地，在经济上危机日近，在科学技术上也是望尘莫及，难道不是十分清楚的吗？西方世界的先生们搔首抓腮地焦急也好，怒发冲冠地冒火也好，唾沫乱溅地造谣也好，都是无法挽回西风的颓势的。正是：
      好梦随流水，东风亿万家，
      举头红月近，回首夕阳斜。
