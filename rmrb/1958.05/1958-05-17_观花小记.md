    Visiting the Disabled Veterans' Convalescent Home

    Nearly a thousand demobilized, transferred, retired, and disabled soldiers, along with family members of martyrs and soldiers, held a grand rally in Wuhan to pledge a great leap forward in production. I gave a speech and met with some representatives. They were very enthusiastic and each had their own leap forward plan. People are the active factor in the Great Leap Forward. Demobilized, transferred, retired, and disabled soldiers, along with family members of martyrs and soldiers, have contributed to the people's revolution and are highly aware, so naturally they appear advanced in the production revolution as well.

    The Disabled Veterans' Convalescent Home is located in the suburbs of Hankou. The location and buildings are good, and foreign guests often visit. The convalescent home houses a total of 1,678 people, about 800 elderly, 27 children, 234 blind people, 50 deaf-mutes, including 50 patients and 299 mental patients. There are 31 staff members, including 7 medical personnel and 6 service personnel. Those residents with some ability to work are assigned as service personnel or engage in growing vegetables, raising pigs, pasting matchboxes, and making straw ropes. A few individuals cut and paste "postal paintings," which are very exquisite and said to be exportable. Most of the residents are from this province, but there are also some from Henan, and even elderly people who participated in the Xinhai Revolution. They are basically homeless. The living standard in the home is 10.05 yuan per person per month, with about 6-7 yuan for food. For those engaged in production, 50% of the production income goes to the individual, 25% goes to the public accumulation fund, and 25% goes to the welfare fund for the residents. In terms of production, the pigs are raised fat and large, but the pig farmers say there is no feed, and dozens have already been sold. I think the home has land suitable for growing feed, and also a kitchen for 1,678 people. The green fodder and concentrated feed for the pigs can be solved with a little thought.

    Eliminating Disasters

    The disaster relief work in Henan Province has resolutely implemented the disaster area work policy of "prevention being more important than relief, and combining prevention and relief," and has widely carried out production construction and production self-rescue movements. They have promoted the advanced experience of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative in Fengqiu County throughout the province: "Unifying the control and use of various economic forces, pre-paying according to labor, properly arranging the production and life of the commune members, and organizing a comprehensive Great Leap Forward." It has solved the problem of the road for production and disaster relief work after collectivization. The Henan Daily editorial said: The experience of the Yingju Agricultural Cooperative has "twelve good things": First, it is good to implement the policy of "disaster prevention is more important than disaster relief, and combining disaster prevention and disaster relief." They do not simply start from disaster relief, but focus on eliminating disasters and developing production. They use disaster prevention to drive disaster relief, and promote disaster prevention from disaster relief. Second, the political and ideological work is done well. Third, water conservancy is completed well. Fourth, fertilizer accumulation is done well. Fifth, production and disaster relief are well grasped. Mobilization is early and grasped tightly. Sixth, the lives of the commune members are well arranged. There is no escape from disaster and begging, no food or money troubles, and the commune members are well fed. Seventh, the livestock are well fed. There are no deaths, price increases, or weakness. Eighth, the pigs are well fed. Ninth, the money is used well. Every penny starts from developing production and mobilizing the labor enthusiasm of the commune members, and one penny is used as several or dozens of pennies. Tenth, the small market in the commune is well run. The commune members' needs for grain, oil, salt, and other daily necessities are uniformly managed and organized for sale by the commune, with a market every ten days. Eleventh, the rectification work is well done. Democratic management of the commune, discussing matters with everyone, and following the mass line. Twelfth, eliminating the four pests and paying attention to hygiene are good.

    Yingju Cooperative resolutely used self-reliance to overcome the famine, "no bankruptcy, no loans, guarantee self-sufficiency, three nos." Treat the entire cooperative as one family, ensure that everyone has food to eat, and work together. Give full play to the role of the existing food materials: "Sweet potatoes are made into flour, one pound equals two pounds," and beans are used to make oil and then tofu. Wages are obtained from water conservancy construction, and disaster prevention is disaster relief. It is very worthy of learning.

    I visited the Changzhuang Cooperative in Dongzhao Township in the suburbs. The entire cooperative consists of three natural villages, with 3,412 mu of land and a population of 1,127. It has suffered from disasters for four consecutive years, and a large number of people have fled famine every year. Last year's summer harvest was only 130 to 150 jin per mu, and the autumn harvest was completely wiped out by floods. The measures taken by the cooperative: First, immediately replant late autumn crops: cabbage, radish, buckwheat, etc.; Second, mobilize the people to collect more than 400,000 jin of substitute foods; Third, mobilize the commune members to harvest 243,000 jin of green fodder; Fourth, grasp all kinds of large and small sideline occupations, engaging in about 20 kinds of sideline occupations, with a total income of 11,700 yuan by the end of March this year; Fifth, the state issued relief funds and loans of about 5,000 yuan; Sixth, classify and rank disaster households, arrange production, and separately assess relief funds. Although the cooperative suffered serious disasters last year, no households fled famine through the above measures, and it was proposed that this year's production target should reach 1,100 jin per mu. The director of the cooperative said: repairing water conservancy and unloading stones can earn more than 6 jiao per work unit in addition to food. There is a lot of this work, so there is no worry about having strength but nowhere to use it; the wheat is growing well this year, and it can yield about 400 jin per mu; rice will be planted in the autumn, and it can yield 600 jin per mu. There is no rice planting tradition here, so masters have been invited from Hubei. The director said that if the water is the same as last year, it can be guaranteed that there will be no disasters. The director said that he has only studied for three months, but he keeps good notes and speaks in an organized manner.

    Thirty of the forty-eight heavily and lightly disaster-stricken counties in Henan have declared that they have eliminated the famine, and other counties can get rid of it soon.

    访残老教养院
    武汉市近千名复员、转业、退伍、残废军人和烈属、军属举行生产大跃进誓师大会，我去讲了话，并接见了一部分代表，他们干劲很大，各人有各人的跃进计划。人是大跃进中的积极因素，复员、转业、退伍、残废军人、烈属、军属，他们在人民革命中贡献过力量，觉悟高，自然在生产革命中也显得先进。
    残老教养院在汉口郊外，地址房屋都好，外宾也常去参观。教养院共收容一千六百七十八人，老的约八百人，儿童二十七人，盲人二百三十四人，聋哑人五十人其中病号有五十人，精神病患者二百九十九人。工作人员三十一人，其中医务人员七人，服务员六人。收容人员中有点劳动力的分配做服务员及从事种菜，养猪，糊火柴盒，打草绳等。有个别人剪贴“邮画”，很精美，说可以出国。收容人员大多数是本省的，河南的也有，还有参加过辛亥革命的老人，他们基本上是无家可归的。院内生活每人月供给标准拾元零五角，内伙食约六、七元。从事生产的，生产所得个人得50％，25％作公积金，25％为院民福利费。在生产上猪养得肥而大，但养猪者说没有饲料，已卖了几十头。我看该院有宜于种饲料的地，又有一千六七百人的厨房，猪的青饲料和精饲料，只要动下脑筋，是可以解决的。
    消灭灾荒
    河南的救灾工作，是坚决贯彻了“防重于救，防救相结合”的灾区工作方针，广泛地开展了生产建设和生产自救运动。他们在全省推广封丘县应举农业社的救灾先进经验：“统一掌握与使用各项经济力量，按劳预支，妥善安排社员生产生活，组织全面大跃进。”它解决了合作化以后生产救灾工作的道路问题。河南日报社论说：应举农业社的经验有“十二好”：一是贯彻执行“防灾重于救灾，防灾与救灾相结合”的方针好。他们不是单纯从救灾出发，而是从消灭灾害和发展生产着眼。以防灾带动救灾，从救灾推动防灾。二是政治思想工作做得好。三是水利化完成得好。四是积肥搞得好。五是生产救灾抓得好。动员早，抓的紧。六是社员生活安排好。没有逃灾要饭的，没有闹粮、闹钱的，社员都吃得饱。七是牲口喂得好。没有死亡、上抬和瘦弱现象。八是猪喂得好。九是钱使用得好。每一个钱都从发展生产，调动社员劳动积极性出发，一个钱当几个钱几十个钱用。十是社里的小市场办得好。社员需要的粮食、油、盐等生活必需品，由社统一经营，组织出售，每十天一个集市。十一是整改工作搞得好。民主办社，遇事和大家商量，走群众路线。十二是除四害、讲卫生好。
    应举社坚决用自力战胜灾荒，“不破产、不贷款、保证自给三不叫”。把全社当作一家，保证都有饭吃，一致努力。发挥所存食料的作用：“红薯打成粉、一斤当二斤”，豆子打油后再打豆腐。从修水利中得到工资，防灾即是救灾。很值得学习。
    看了郊区东赵乡的常庄社，全社三个自然村，土地三千四百一十二亩，人口一千一百二十七人。连续四年遭受灾害，每年都有大批人逃荒。去年夏收每亩只一百三十至一百五十斤，秋被水淹全无收。社里的措施：一、立即补种晚秋作物：白菜、萝卜、荞麦等；二、发动人民采集代食品四十余万斤；三、发动社员割收青饲草料二十四万三千斤；四、大小副业一齐抓，搞有副业约二十余种，到今年3月底共收入一万一千七百元；五、国家发给的救济款、贷款约五千元；六、将灾户分类排队，安排生产，分别评定救济款。去年社里虽受到严重灾害，通过上述措施没有一户逃荒，并且提出今年的生产指标每亩要达到一千一百斤。社长说：修水利、卸石头、每工除吃饭外可剩六角多钱。此项工作多，不愁有力无处使；今年麦子长得好，每亩可打四百来斤；秋季改种水稻，每亩可收六百斤。此处无种稻习惯，已向湖北请来师父。社长说，今年如遇去年样的水，可保证不受灾。社长自说只读过三个月书，但笔记本记得好，说话也有条理。
    河南四十八个轻重灾县，已有三十个县称已经消灭了灾荒，其他各县也可很快摆脱。
