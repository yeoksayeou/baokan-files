Understanding Children
Lü Fang

I heard the following story:

Zhang Xiaozhen is three years old, has a strong personality, and likes to act independently. If you ask him to sing with the other children, he refuses; if you ask him to dance with the other children, he is not happy to do so.

One day, Xiaozhen was concentrating on building a house and suddenly called out happily, "Auntie!" He wanted his auntie to see the results of his work. The teacher walked over and said, "It's built really well," and at the same time suggested to the other children that they all clap to congratulate the completion of the new house. From then on, Zhang Xiaozhen liked building blocks even more. When he was building blocks by himself, the teacher stood beside him to observe, or built with him, consciously talking to him about competing with the other children in building blocks. Zhang Xiaozhen happily agreed. Finally, he gradually became accustomed to being with the group.

We can learn a lot from this small example.

First of all, we must care about children. We all know that we can only educate children if we understand them. In educating children, many difficulties often arise from not understanding what the child is thinking about every day, what they like, and where the causes of problems lie.

Understanding children is based on loving and caring for them. If you are indifferent to a child's behavior, you will not understand them, even if you are with them all day long. Especially in the eyes of some parents, they always hope that their children will be quiet and not disturb adults, so they naturally think that they do not need any understanding or education.

Parents who care about their children, understand their characteristics, and understand the thoughts and feelings of children at each stage of development can understand their behavior and educate them correctly.

Understanding children is not an easy task; it requires constant and careful observation. Zhang Xiaozhen's problem was that he did not like being in a group. Changing his attitude towards the group could not be achieved with a few words. What was important was to establish a personal connection with him, pay attention to his growth and development, carefully observe his behavior and actions, begin to eliminate some of his doubts about the group, and make him willing to be close to the group.

Be sensitive to children's behavior and seize their strengths and weaknesses in their budding stages. After doing something interesting, young children always want to tell the people closest to them as quickly as possible. In this case, any indifferent attitude from parents will dampen the child's enthusiasm. After the teacher sensitively discovered Zhang Xiaozhen's love of building blocks, she quickly seized this characteristic, patiently helped the child develop it, and guided and educated the child correctly according to his characteristics.

Understanding children is not difficult at all. As long as everyone truly recognizes their responsibility to the country to educate children, treats children sincerely and enthusiastically, and observes them regularly and carefully, they can understand them and find the right way to educate them.

    要了解孩子
    吕方
    我听到过这样一件事。
    张小真三周岁了，个性强，好单独行动。叫他和小朋友一起唱歌，他不肯；叫他和小朋友一起跳舞，他也不乐意。
    一天，小真正聚精会神地在搭一个房子，忽然高兴地叫起来，“阿姨”。这是希望阿姨去看看他工作的成绩。教养员走过来说，“搭的真好”，同时向小朋友们提议，大家鼓掌，祝贺这座新房子的建成。从此，张小真更喜欢搭积木了。他独自搭积木的时候，教养员站在他身旁观察，或者和他一起搭，有意识地和他谈到和小朋友们比赛搭积木的事情。张小真高兴地答应了。终于他逐渐习惯于和集体相处。
    从这个小小的事例里，可以得到不少的教益。
    首先是要关心孩子。我们都知道，只有了解孩子，才能教育孩子。在对孩子进行教育时，许许多多的困难，往往发生在不了解孩子每天在想些什么，喜欢些什么，和产生问题的原因在那里。
    了解孩子是以爱护孩子、关心孩子为前提的。如果对孩子的行为漠不关心，就是整天和孩子在一起也是不了解的。特别是在有些父母的眼里，总是希望孩子安安生生的，不扰乱大人，所以，也自然会以为他不需要什么了解和教育。
    父母能够关心孩子，了解孩子的特点，了解孩子在各个发育阶段的思想，感情范围，这样就能理解孩子的行为，正确地进行教育。
    了解孩子不是件容易的事情，这需要经常细心地观察孩子。张小真的毛病是不喜欢集体，要想改变他对集体的态度，不是几句话能说服的，重要的是要和他建立个人之间的联系，注意他的成长和发展，细心观察他的举止和行动，开始消除他对于集体的某些疑虑，使他愿意和集体接近。
    对待孩子的行为要敏感，及时抓住在萌芽状态时的优点和缺点。小孩子作了有趣的事情后，总希望急忙地告诉给自己最亲近的人。在这种情况下，父母的任何冷淡的态度，都会挫伤孩子的积极性。教养员很敏感地发现了张小真喜欢搭积木的特点后，便迅速地抓住这个特点，耐心地帮助孩子发展这个特点，根据孩子的特点，进行正确的引导和教育。
    了解孩子，并没有什么了不起的困难。只要每一个人真正认识到自己对祖国负有教育儿童的责任，真诚地、热情地对待孩子，经常地、细心地观察孩子，就能了解他们，找到正确地教育孩子的方法。
