    Accepting Readers' Suggestions
    "A Song Every Half-Month" Changed to "A Song Every Week"
    Since the "A Song Every Half-Month" feature in the supplement began appearing, we have continuously received many letters expressing welcome, and many readers have hoped that we could publish a song every week. In order to contribute to the currently vigorously developing socialist singing movement and to meet the needs of readers who love to sing, starting this week, we will publish a new song every Thursday. We sincerely hope that composers and poets from all over the country can provide us with various themes, short and powerful mass songs and lyrics, and we also hope that readers will offer opinions on these songs.

    接受读者的建议
    “半月一歌”改为“每周一歌”
    副刊上的“半月一歌”和读者见面以来，连续收到不少表示欢迎的来信，很多读者并希望我们每周登一首歌。为了能为目前蓬勃发展的社会主义歌咏运动尽一分力，满足爱好歌唱的读者的需要，从本周起，每逢星期四刊登一首新歌。我们热诚地盼望全国各地的作曲家、诗人能够供给我们各种题材、短小有力的群众歌曲和歌词，也盼望读者们对这些歌曲提出意见。
