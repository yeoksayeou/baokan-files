    A Sea of Wisdom
    ——Notes on Visiting the National Agricultural Tools Exhibition
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Ji Di
    On the plaza of the Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College, thousands of new agricultural tools are displayed. After listening to the guides' explanations, one can see that each reformed new agricultural tool shines with the wisdom of the working people, demonstrating the intelligence of our working people.
    People have never seen such an exhibition. There are not many charts, not many slogans, and none of those red and green decorations. But each tool has clear indicators of multiplying production efficiency in labor practice. Some of these tools are made of wood, some of iron, and some of bamboo. The forms are diverse and ever-changing. Many of them have only recently been created, but they have already exerted great power in the great leap in agriculture. They are a clear testament to the great leap in agricultural production nationwide, and also a reliable material foundation for realizing the great leap in agriculture.
    People were amazed to see hundreds of different waterwheels of all kinds. Some are modified from cotton gins, some from bicycles, some from looms, some from iron-wheeled carts, and so on. Zhang Dehe, of the Yu'gan County Construction Engineering Team in Jiangxi Province, modified a cotton gin into a double-wheeled dragon-bone waterwheel, which is easy to pedal and highly efficient, capable of irrigating thirty mu of land per day. Farmers in Jing County, Hebei Province, modified a bicycle into a foot-pedaled flywheel waterwheel, allowing them to sit and pump water while reading. Members of the Fumin Agricultural Cooperative in Wangwenzhuang, Jinghai County, Hebei Province, almost entirely imitated an axial-flow pump with wood. Its efficiency is exactly the same as a steel one made in a factory. Driven by a ten-horsepower engine, it can pump 540 tons of water per hour, only with a lower head, while its cost is less than one-tenth of that of a factory product. Old dragon-bone waterwheels and new-style waterwheels such as the Liberation-style ones promoted since liberation have all been改造[reformed] by the peasants. The dragon-bone waterwheel has been fitted with a flywheel, making it lighter and easier to pedal, and the pumping volume has also increased. Zhang Dehe of Yu'gan County also installed a fan on the frame of the dragon-bone waterwheel. Once pedaled, the water is pumped below, and the fan above also moves. The Liberation-style waterwheel is turned around a well by human or animal power. Pushing the waterwheel for a day is equivalent to carrying more than 100 jin and walking 70 li, which is very heavy labor. Now, the peasants have put a long piece of wood with stone rollers on both ends across the turntable, and two people can stand and pull the long wood to rotate quickly, which not only increases the amount of water, but also saves labor and eliminates the need to walk. Dragon-bone waterwheels and Liberation-style waterwheels modified in this way exist in all provinces, with various styles, all becoming efficient and lightweight things. In addition, there are a large number of artificial rainmakers modified from fire hoses and various types of suction cylinder waterwheels. Among them, there is also a suction cylinder waterwheel similar to a children's seesaw. As the seesaw goes up and down, the two submerged suction cylinders pump water. This type of waterwheel can be operated by half a labor force.
    Similarly, in the past and recent six months, workers have also created many water-lifting tools for farmers. Around the newly built large pool in the exhibition hall, along with the various waterwheels created by farmers, are various boiler-backed machines and gas engines driving water pumps to pump water. Motors roared, and streams of water of varying thicknesses sprayed into the pool. Among them, the water column of the water-hammer pump manufactured by Changsha Iron Factory in Hunan Province is the highest. Increasing the horsepower can continuously raise the water to a height of one or two hundred meters, which is a powerful tool made by workers to support irrigation in mountainous areas.
    As rich and varied as the water lifting tools are the construction tools for water conservancy projects. Hubei, Anhui, Henan, Northeast, Southwest and other places, each place has its own earth-moving wooden rails, some with iron strips on the surface, some with bamboo skins, and can also switch tracks. All kinds of earth-moving vehicles are speeding on the wooden rails. At this exhibition, people no longer see the lines of people carrying soil. In the comprehensive hall, you can see another new scene, which is the scene of a farmer building a dam in Anhui Province. Countless parallel tracks extend far into the distance on the earth dam, and large teams of laborers push large numbers of earth-moving vehicles on the tracks. The same labor scene, but the labor method has changed.
    Water conservancy construction and soil transportation is heavy labor, so there are the most creations in this area. In addition to wooden rails, the important ones are aerial cableways, various pulleys, and conveyor belts, conveyor buckets, and so on. Henan, Anhui and other provinces have done the most earthwork in water conservancy construction last winter and this spring, and have created the most. In the exhibition hall, people saw all kinds of吊斗[hanging buckets] moving freely up and down on the aerial cableway, some from Henan, some from Anhui, and some from Yunnan. Most of them unload the soil automatically, and some even load the soil automatically.
    "Flying in the air, pushing on the ground," a new era of change is taking place in rural transportation in our country. In rural areas of our country, especially in mountainous areas, farmers mostly carry manure and harvest crops on their shoulders, and in the southwestern provinces they also use backloads, which has been the case for thousands of years. But today, farmers have issued a bold statement, to "天线化[aerialize]" and "车子化[vehicularize]". Today, some rural areas in Hubei, Yunnan, and Guizhou have indeed been aerialized, and some rural areas in many provinces across the country have been vehicularized. Some places in the Yangtze River Basin are also striving for ship transport. In the rural transport tools in the exhibition hall, people can fully see this change that is taking place. The exhibition hall displays various handcarts created by farmers in various places, single-wheeled, double-wheeled, and three-wheeled, and various types of ships, shallow-water, amphibious, and multi-purpose. Workers in various places have also created many powered transportation tools for farmers, such as motor sailing boats and three-wheeled cars. The three-wheeled car built in Wuhu, Anhui Province, has strong horsepower, large load capacity, low price, and is easy to drive, making it most suitable for rural use.
    For the great leap in agricultural production, in order to realize "four, five, eight," farmers in various places have transformed and created a batch of new tools. The double-wheeled double-铧[share] plow that went to the countryside the year before last has now appeared in various forms, lighter, easier to use, and can be used for sowing, fertilizing, weeding, etc., becoming multi-purpose. Wang Yushun, a farmer in Changge County, Henan Province, also created a double-铧[share] deep-plowing plow with one in front and one in back, and Sichuan created a two-way plow with 铧[share] that can be turned on both sides, suitable for mountainous areas, and so on.
    Workers and handicraft workers in various places are vigorously transforming and creating new tillage machinery for farmers. The soil crushing harrow manufactured by Baokang Iron Industry Cooperative in Hubei Province increases the efficiency of soil crushing by three times. The peanut harvester manufactured by Changzhou Machinery Factory in Jiangsu Province can harvest ten mu a day. The water耧[seed drill] in Tongwei County, Gansu Province, can sow drought-resistant seeds. There are also rice transplanters, rice planting machines, and other completely new things. Most excitingly, most provinces across the country are试制[trial-producing] tractors. Heilongjiang and Liaoning are试制[trial-producing] them, Jiangsu and Jiangxi are试制[trial-producing] them, Henan and Hubei are试制[trial-producing] them, and Baoshan County and Yuxi County in Yunnan Province are also试制[trial-producing] them. The exhibition hall explained that there have been seventy types of tractors tested nationwide in the past six months. There are diesel, charcoal, and gas, there are rubber wheels and crawler tracks, and there are dry-land and paddy-field types. Jiangxi Province has not only built the excellent quality "August 1st" tractor, but also created a batch of paddy-field traction agricultural implements.
    The plain low-water-level hydropower station in Tianjin Prefecture, Hebei Province, the underground tile pipe irrigation canals created by farmers such as Wang Yuzhen in Yanshi County, Henan Province, the biogas generating pools that are being vigorously developed in Hubei and other provinces, the levels and cement created by farmers in various places, and the solar water heaters built in Shanghai and Gansu, etc., are all shining in the exhibition. The masses of peasants have done things that many people in the past dared not imagine. The peasants did it with the spirit of conquering everything, and they did it well, and they all succeeded. And the peasants are continuing to work hard. The exhibition hall tells people: the technical revolution is just beginning. (Attached pictures)

    智慧的海洋
    ——全国农具展览会参观记
    新华社记者　纪堤
    北京农业机械化学院的广场上，摆满了几千件新式农具，当你听了讲解员一一解说以后，就可以看出每一件改革了的新式农具都闪烁着劳动人民的智慧的光辉，显示着我国劳动人民的聪明才智。
    人们没有参观过这样的展览会，没有很多图表，没有很多标语，没有那些红红绿绿的装饰。但是每件工具上都有着在劳动实践中提高多倍生产效率的鲜明指标。这些工具有的是木制的、有的是铁制的、有些是竹制的，形式是多种多样、千变万化。它们很多是刚创造出来不久，但是已经在农业大跃进中发挥了强大的威力。它们是全国农业生产大跃进的鲜明的见证，也是实现农业大跃进的可靠的物质基础。
    人们惊奇地看到了数以百计的各种不同的水车。有轧花机改装的、自行车改装的、织布机改装的、铁轮大车改装的等等。江西省余干县建筑工程队张德和用轧花机改制的双轮龙骨水车，踏动轻便，效率很高，每天就可以浇三十亩地。河北省景县农民用自行车改制的脚踏飞轮水车，坐着抽水还可以看书。河北省静海县王稳庄富民农业社的社员，几乎完全用木材仿制了一部轴流式水泵，和工厂用钢制的效率完全一样，用十马力的发动机带动每小时可出水五百四十吨，只有水的扬程比较低些，而造价还不到工厂出品的十分之一。旧的龙骨水车，解放以来推广的解放式等新式水车都被农民改造了。龙骨水车加了飞轮，轻巧了，可以坐着踏了，抽水量也大了。余干县张德和还在龙骨水车架上安装了风扇，一经踏动，下面抽水，上面风扇也搧动起来了。解放式水车是用人力或畜力绕井转动的。人推水车一天等于负重一百多斤走七十里路，劳动是很重的。现在农民在转盘上横了一条两端有石滚的长木，两人可以站着拉动长木飞快的旋转，既提高了出水量，又省力又不要走路。像这样改装的龙骨水车和解放式水车各省都有，式样百出，都成了效率高而且轻巧的东西。此外，还有大批利用救火水龙改装的人工降雨器和各式各样的吸筒式水车。其中还有一部类似儿童玩具翘翘板的吸筒水车。翘翘板一上一下，下面伸在水中的两个被压的吸筒就出水。这种水车用半劳力就可以抽水了。
    同样，过去和最近半年来，工人也为农民创造了不少的提水工具。在展览馆新修的大水池的周围，和农民创造的各式各样水车在一起的，还有各种锅驼机、煤气机在带动水泵抽水。马达轰鸣，一股股粗细的水柱向池内喷射着。其中湖南省长沙铁工厂制造的水击扬水器的水柱最高。加大马力一直可以把水击到一、二百公尺的高度，是工人为支援山区灌溉制造的利器。
    和提水工具同样丰富多彩的是兴修水利的施工工具。湖北、安徽、河南、东北、西南等地方，各地有各地的运土木轨，有面上加铁条的、有加竹皮的，而且还可以扳道岔。各式各样的运土车在木轨上飞驰着。在这次展览会上，人们再也看不到那种挑土的行列了。在综合馆里，你可以看到另一个新的场面，那是安徽省一个农民筑坝的场面。土坝上并列无数的道轨一直伸到远方，大队的劳动者推着大批土车在轨道上奔驰。同样的劳动场面，劳动方式已经改变了。
    水利施工运土是繁重的劳动，因而这方面的创造也最多。除木轨外重要的是天线吊斗，各种滑车，和传送带、传送斗等等。去冬今春河南、安徽等省兴修水利作的土方最多，创造也最多。展览馆中，人们看到各式吊斗一上一下地在天线上来往自如，有河南的，有安徽的，还有云南的。它们大多数是自动卸土的，有的还自动装土。
    “空中飞、地上推”，我国农村的运输正在发生划时代的变化。我国农村特别是山区，农民送粪、收获等等田间运输，大多数是肩挑的，西南各省还用背驮，这是几千年以来的事了。但是今天农民发出了豪语，要“天线化”、“车子化”。今天，湖北、云南、贵州有些农村确实已经天线化了，全国许多省份都有一些农村车子化了。长江流域的一些地方还在争取船运化。在展览馆的农村运输工具，人们完全可以看到这一正在发生着的变化。展览馆陈列着各地农民创造的各式的手推车，单轮的，双轮的，还有三轮的，各式各样的船，浅水的，水陆两用的，多种用途的。各地工人还为农民创造了许多动力的运输工具，像机帆船、三轮汽车等。安徽省芜湖所造的三轮汽车马力强、载量大、价格低，便于驾驶，是最适于农村用的。
    为了农业生产大跃进，为了实现“四五八”，各地农民都改造和创造了一批新工具。前年下乡的双轮双铧犁，现在出现了各种各样的形式，轻了，好用了，而且可以用来播种、施肥、除草等等，多用化了。河南长葛县农民王玉顺还创造了一前一后的双铧深耕犁，四川创造了铧子可以两面翻动的适于山区的双向犁等等。
    各地工人和手工业工人都在大力为农民改造和创造新的耕作机具。湖北省保康铁业社制造的碎土耙，把碎土的效率提高三倍。江苏省常州机械厂制造的花生收获机一天可收十亩。甘肃省通渭县的水耧可以抗旱播种。还有插秧船、插秧机等等完全新的东西。最令人兴奋的是全国大多数省都在试制拖拉机。黑龙江、辽宁在试制，江苏、江西在试制，河南、湖北在试制，云南省的保山县、玉溪县也在试制。展览馆说明，半年来全国试验的拖拉机已有七十种了。有柴油的、木炭的、也有煤气的，有胶轮的也有链轨的，有旱作的也有水田的。江西省不仅造出了质量优良的八一拖拉机，而且创造了一批水田曳引农具。
    河北天津专区的平原低水位水电站，河南省偃师县农民王玉振等创造的地下瓦管灌溉渠，湖北等省正在大力发展沼气发生池，各地农民创造的水平仪和水泥，上海、甘肃所造的太阳能烧水器等等东西，都在展览会放着异彩。农民群众作了过去许多人们不敢想像的事。农民以征服一切的气魄这样作了，而且作得很好，都成功了。而且农民还在继续大作特作。展览馆告诉人们说：技术革命这才是开始呢。（附图片）
