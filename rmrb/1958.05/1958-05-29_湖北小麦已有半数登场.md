Hubei's wheat is golden across the north and south banks of the Yangtze River. Currently, all areas are rushing to cut and harvest day and night.

In the past few days, the weather in Hubei Province has been sunny, and the harvesting work has been progressing quickly and well. So far, nearly half of the province's wheat has been harvested and brought in. Some counties have basically completed harvesting in three or four days. Xiaogan Prefecture, with more than 2.6 million mu of wheat, harvested more than half in four days. Wuchang, Echeng and other counties with earlier seasons have devoted all their efforts to threshing after the harvest is over. It is expected that the wheat harvest in the province will be basically completed by the end of the month.

The wheat harvesting work in Hubei Province was carried out on the basis of full preparation. In order to get the bumper harvest in time, all localities have been preparing ideologically, materially, and in terms of labor organization since the end of April. Before the tense harvesting began, cadres of government agencies, officers, soldiers, teachers, students, and urban residents went to the countryside to participate in the rush harvest. According to statistics from relevant departments, the army of reinforcements rushing to the countryside throughout the province reached 1.5 million people. Encouraged by the bumper harvest, the peasants' enthusiasm for labor is high. People describe the current rural scene as: "Every household has a lock, everyone goes to the canteen, men and women, old and young, all go to the front, and grandmothers hold their babies and do the laundry."

    湖北小麦已有半数登场
    本报讯　湖北省大江南北两岸的小麦遍地金黄，目前各地正日夜抢割抢收。
    这几天，湖北省各地天气晴朗，抢收工作进行得又快又好。到目前为止，全省将近一半的小麦已收割登场。有的县三四天时间就基本收割完了。孝感专区二百六十多万亩小麦，四天就抢割了一多半。季节较早的武昌、鄂城等县在收割结束以后，已全力投入抢打。全省小麦预计在月底基本可以收割完毕。
    湖北省抢割小麦工作是在充分准备的基础上进行的。为了把丰收的庄稼及时拿到手，各地从4月下旬起就从思想上、物质上以及劳动组织上作了准备。紧张的收割还没有开始，各地机关干部、军官、士兵、教师、学生和城镇居民，便纷纷下乡参加抢收。据有关部门统计，全省开往农村支援抢收的大军达一百五十万人。农民在丰收的鼓舞下，劳动热情高涨。人们是这样形容当前的农村景象：“户户一把锁，人人上食堂，男女老幼齐上阵，婆婆抱娃洗衣裳”。（附图片）
