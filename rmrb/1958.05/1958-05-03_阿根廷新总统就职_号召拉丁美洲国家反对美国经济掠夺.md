Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 2nd: Arturo Frondizi, who was elected President of Argentina in the election on February 23 this year, was sworn into office on the 1st and delivered a speech in Congress, expounding on the new government's policy program.

Frondizi said that Argentina will continue as a member of the United Nations and Latin American countries, but its representatives will support the people of all countries against all forms of colonialism and political subordination, as well as economic or military dependence. Argentina will trade with all countries without discrimination and will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries.

Frondizi said that the Argentine economy is "currently in crisis." Domestic income is only sufficient to cover 54% of expenses. The national treasury is currently empty, gold and foreign exchange reserves are depleted, and inflation is increasing day by day.

Frondizi criticized the United States' trade policy without directly mentioning the United States by name, pointing out that this is one of the reasons for the deterioration of Argentina's foreign trade. He called on Latin American countries to unite against the dumping of U.S. agricultural products and discrimination against Latin American countries' commodities, and to adopt common economic policies to establish a common market for Latin American countries. Frondizi also said that in order to develop the economy, Argentina welcomes foreign capital investment, but in this regard, Argentina will first rely on national capital.

When talking about domestic issues, Frondizi said that the first bill he will propose to Congress will be to demand amnesty and release of political prisoners. He also promised to grant trade unions greater freedom.

    阿根廷新总统就职
    号召拉丁美洲国家反对美国经济掠夺
    据新华社2日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：在今年2月23日大选中当选为阿根廷总统的阿图罗·弗朗迪西，在1日宣誓就职，并且在国会发表演说，阐述新政府的施政纲领。
    弗朗迪西说，阿根廷将继续作为联合国和拉丁美洲国家的成员，但是它的代表将支持各国人民反对任何形式的殖民主义和政治上的从属关系以及经济上或军事上的从属关系。阿根廷将毫无歧视地同所有国家进行贸易，不干涉其他国家的内政。
    弗朗迪西说，阿根廷经济“目前正处在危机中”。国内的收入只足应付开支的54％。目前国库已经空虚，黄金和外汇储备枯竭，通货膨胀一天比一天加剧。
    弗朗迪西在没有直接提到美国的名字的情况下抨击了美国的贸易政策，指出这是阿根廷对外贸易恶化的一个原因。他号召拉丁美洲国家团结起来反对美国农产品的倾销和对拉丁美洲国家的商品的歧视；采取共同的经济政策来建立拉丁美洲国家的共同市场。弗朗迪西还说，为了发展经济，阿根廷欢迎外国资本的投资，但是在这方面阿根廷将首先依靠国家资本。
    弗朗迪西在谈到内政问题时说，他向国会提出的第一项法案将是要求大赦和释放政治犯。他同时还允诺给予工会以更大的自由。
