Notes

    An Ant Trying to Shake a Tree
    The "Foreign Aid Bill" amended and passed by the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 23rd authorizes the President to provide economic and financial "aid" to any socialist country other than the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
    While the United States is in a state of utter exhaustion due to a severe economic crisis and is unable to attend to its own affairs, why does it "violate convention" and extend a hand of "aid" to socialist countries it has always hated? A report by the United Press revealed the truth: it turns out that Eisenhower wanted to use American aid to encourage these countries' "independence." This makes it very clear that this is nothing more than the "wicked hand" of reactionary American politicians attempting to weaken the solidarity of socialist countries. However, in the face of the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp, this American conspiracy is truly "an ant trying to shake a tree, ridiculously overestimating itself."

    蚍蜉撼大树
    美国参议院外交委员会23日修正通过的“援外法案”，授权总统对除去苏联、中国和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国以外的任何社会主义国家提供经济和财政“援助”。
    在美国被严重的经济危机弄得焦头烂额、自顾不暇的时候，为什么竟“违反常例”，向他们一向仇视的社会主义国家伸出“援助”之手呢？合众社的报道揭了底，原来是为了让艾森豪威尔以美国的援助来鼓励这些国家的“独立”。这就很清楚了，这不过是美国反动政客妄想削弱社会主义国家的团结的“罪恶的黑手”罢了。然而，在磐石般团结的社会主义阵营面前，美国的这种阴谋，真是所谓“蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量”。
