Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 7th. Scientific workers here held a paper presentation conference at the Guangdong Science Hall on the two Sundays from the end of April to the beginning of May. A total of forty-six scientific papers were read, with a total audience of 2,600 people.

The paper "Rice Growth Process and Cultivation Techniques" read on April 27 was jointly researched by the famous rice expert, President of South China Agricultural College, Ding Ying, and related personnel. Based on the experience of Guangdong farmers in increasing production, they focused on the two central links of the rice growth period—the tillering period and the grain formation period—and conducted in-depth and systematic observation and research on rice cultivation techniques. They initially grasped the scientific laws of rice in the growth process, making it possible to increase rice tillering and total number of panicles through artificial measures, thereby increasing yield per unit area. Ding Ying, the Communist Party member and rice expert in his seventies, emphasized in his paper the importance of scientists attaching importance to summarizing and improving the production experience of the masses. The papers read at this conference also included research projects with practical significance and local characteristics, such as the chemical treatment of bamboo replacing steel bars, the use of mixed soil admixtures, and the introduction of shading, heat insulation, and ventilation architectural design experience in subtropical regions. Communist Party member and Vice President of Zhongshan Medical College, Professor Liang Boqiang, and Professor Chen Xintao, etc., based on several years of combined medical practice, conducted discussions on the incidence of primary liver cancer in Guangdong and the various factors causing liver cancer, as well as the prevention of schistosomiasis in Guangdong and other major medical issues related to people's health. Professor Huang Shengsan, an old traditional Chinese medicine doctor with more than 40 years of clinical experience, also made public five secretly passed down treatment prescriptions in his thesis "Effective New Treatment for Influenza."

Among the nine papers read at the May 4th report meeting, one was a study of the revolutionary struggle of Guangdong workers: "The Struggle of Guangdong Workers Against the Kuomintang Right Wing Before the April 15th Counter-Revolutionary Coup."

These paper presentation conferences were organized by the Guangdong Branch of the National Science Federation.

    广东科学工作者举行论文报告会
    许多科学论文具有现实意义
    新华社广州7日电　从4月底到5月初的两个星期日，这里的科学工作者在广东科学馆分别举行的论文报告会上，共宣读了四十六篇科学论文的内容提要，听众共达二千六百人。
    在4月27日宣读的论文“水稻生育过程与栽培技术措施”，是由著名水稻专家、华南农学院院长丁颖和有关人员共同研究的。他们根据广东农民群众的增产经验，抓住水稻生育期的两个中心环节——分蘖期和穗粒形成期，深入系统地进行观察和研究水稻的栽培技术，初步掌握了水稻在生育期过程中的科学规律，这样就有可能通过人为措施增加水稻的分蘖和总穗数，从而提高单位面积产量。这位年过古稀的共产党员水稻专家丁颖在论文中强调科学家重视总结和提高群众生产经验的重要性。在这次会上宣读的论文，还有竹代钢筋化学处理研究、混合土掺合料的使用，以及介绍亚热带地区的遮阳、隔热和通风建筑设计经验等具有现实意义和地方特色的研究项目。共产党员、中山医学院副院长梁伯强教授和陈心陶教授等人，根据几年来结合医学实践，分别对原发性肝癌在广东的发病率和引起肝癌的各种因素，以及广东血吸虫病的预防等关系人民健康的重大医学问题，进行了探讨。有四十多年临床经验的老中医黄省三教授在他论著的“流行性感冒有效新疗法”中，还公开了秘传的五个治疗处方。
    在5月4日报告会上宣读的九篇论文中，有一篇是研究广东工人革命斗争的：“四·一五反革命政变前广东工人对国民党右派的斗争”。
    这些论文报告会是由全国科联广东分会组织的。
