Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 16th: The news of the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third giant artificial Earth satellite has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai.

Last night, many people could not help but cheer when they heard the good news on the radio. They immediately went around spreading the word, and some units even issued express reports overnight. This morning, many factories and schools broadcast the news over their broadcasting stations.

After seeing the comparative data of the Soviet satellite and the American satellite in the newspaper, workers at the Shanghai Steam Turbine Factory said, "The United States boasted a lot and failed many times before launching three small satellites. The total weight of the three American satellites is not even a fraction of the weight of one Soviet satellite."

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 16th: The people of Guangzhou cheer the successful launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite. Huang Youmou, Acting Dean of South China Normal College and Director of the Guangzhou Artificial Satellite Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said in a statement that the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite going into space shows that the Soviet Union has completely mastered the basic technologies necessary for space flight.

Zhou Yukan, Director of the Physics Department of Zhongshan University, and Gao Zhaolan, Director of the Optics Teaching and Research Group, said that from the competition to launch artificial satellites, we can see the peaceful competition between the two camps. The socialist camp will surely win, and the East Wind will surely prevail over the West Wind.

Many citizens of Guangzhou, after learning about the launch of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite last night and this morning, called the newspaper to inquire about the details and congratulated the Soviet people.

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, May 16th: The people of Shenyang jubilantly cheered the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite going into space.

This morning, the bulletin boards scattered in every corner of Shenyang were filled with pedestrians reading this inspiring news. Many workers and cadres who got up early to go to work rushed to buy the Shenyang Daily, which carried the news, on their way to work.

After hearing the news, all the scientists and workers at the Institute of Metal Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences excitedly sang the song "The East Wind Prevails over the West Wind."

Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou
Received Satellite Signals

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 16th: This morning, several units in Shanghai received the telegraph signal of the Soviet Union's third artificial Earth satellite for the first time on the frequency of 20.005 megacycles. The signals received were all a group of one short tone, one long tone, and two short tones, similar to the Morse code "L."

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 16th: From 10:26 to 10:33 this morning, the receiver of the Zijinshan Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences received the signal of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite, which was passing over Nanjing at that time. The satellite signal was very strong at the beginning, then sometimes strong and sometimes weak, with one particularly strong segment. The signal of this satellite is easier to distinguish and hear clearly than the signal of the second satellite.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 16th: The Guangzhou Municipal Telecommunications Bureau's receiving station began to receive the telegraph signal of the Soviet Union's third artificial satellite at 10:25 this morning. The signal was similar to the Morse code "L" and the sound was clear and loud.
