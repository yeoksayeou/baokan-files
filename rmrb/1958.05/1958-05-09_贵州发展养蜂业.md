    Guizhou Province's ethnic minority farmers have nearly doubled the number of honeybees they raise this year compared to last year. According to incomplete statistics, by mid-April, the province had nearly 50,000 bee colonies. It is estimated that the province will produce more than 15,000 dan (750 metric tons) of honey this year, doubling last year's output and increasing by about four times compared to the pre-liberation era.

    In Zheng'an, Renhuai, Wuchuan, Sinan, Tianzhu and other counties with more oilseed rape and fruit trees, many farmers now keep three to five bee colonies, some even up to eight or nine. In Sandu Shui Autonomous County, where beekeeping was rare in the past, most farmers now keep bees. In order to help farmers in mountainous areas improve bee breeds and enhance breeding techniques, the Provincial Department of Agriculture plans to import 500 colonies of fine Italian bee breeds from Tianjin this year, hold training classes for beekeeping cadres, and impart advanced technologies in feeding management and pest and disease control to farmers.

    贵州发展养蜂业
    贵州山区各族农民今年饲养的蜜蜂约比去年增加一倍。据不完全统计，到4月中旬全省饲养的蜜蜂已达近五万群。估计全省今年可产蜂蜜一万五千多市担，比去年增加一倍，比解放前增加约四倍。
    种植油菜和培育果木树较多的正安、仁怀、婺川、思南、天柱等县，今年有不少农户养蜂三、五群，有的达八、九群。过去很少养蜂的三都水族自治县，今年大部分农户都养了蜜蜂。为了帮助山区农民改良蜂种和改进饲养技术，省农业厅计划今年从天津引进五百群意大利优良种蜂，举办养蜂干部训练班，向农民传授饲养管理和防治病虫害等先进技术。
