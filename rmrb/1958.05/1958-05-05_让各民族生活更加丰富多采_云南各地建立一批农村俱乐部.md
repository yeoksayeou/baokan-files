    Making the Lives of All Nationalities More Colorful
    A Number of Rural Clubs Established in Various Parts of Yunnan

    (Reported by this newspaper) To meet the cultural needs of farmers of all nationalities, a number of rural clubs have been established in various parts of Yunnan Province. These clubs mostly adopt small-scale and diverse activities, carrying out various cultural activities among farmers of all nationalities, such as reading books and newspapers, holding exhibitions, showing slides, singing, dancing, literacy campaigns, learning technology, and sports and hygiene. Each nationality has its own unique customs and cultural traditions. In carrying out activities, the clubs pay attention to adopting forms that are popular among farmers of all nationalities, such as the Yi people's "Meige" (mountain songs), the Dai people's "Zanha" (folk songs), the Bai people's Dabenqu (ballad singing), and the Han people's flower lantern dances, which are all very popular among the masses. Many clubs have also created a variety of lively and vivid entertainment activities according to local conditions and the times. For example, they have created tree newspapers, slate newspapers, mobile big-character posters, mobilization placards, and earthen broadcasts, which can be carried out in the fields, before and after meetings, by the fireside, and under the moonlight.
    These activities are closely integrated with the political tasks and production activities of each period, using real people and real events as themes to promptly reflect reality. Therefore, they not only enrich the lives of farmers of all nationalities, but also serve the work and production very well. The Yongfu Agricultural Cooperative Club on the shore of Erhai Lake in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture used Spring Festival couplets, good news reports, and cartoons to carry out propaganda and mobilization on the water conservancy construction site this year, and the laborers' enthusiasm for work was even greater.
    Through the activities of five thousand clubs, many artistic talents have been cultivated among all nationalities. Among the approximately 70,000 mass amateur cultural activity activists, poets, writers, singers, painters, and many excellent actors from all nationalities have emerged. The Dai folk singer Kang Langshi, some of whose poems have been translated and reprinted in five countries. The Bai elder artist Yang Han sings "Dabenqu" (ballad singing), which can be sung for days and nights, and the masses never tire of listening.

    让各民族生活更加丰富多采
    云南各地建立一批农村俱乐部
    本报讯　为了满足各民族农民的文化需要，云南省各地建立了一批农村俱乐部。这些俱乐部大多采取小型多样的活动方式，在各族农民中开展看书、读报、展览、幻灯、唱歌、跳舞、扫盲、学习技术和体育卫生等各项文化活动。各民族都有自己独特的生活习俗和文化传统，俱乐部在开展活动中注意采取各族农民喜闻乐见的形式，如彝族的“梅葛”（山歌）、傣族的“赞哈”（民歌）、白族的大本曲（说唱词），汉族的花灯等，都很受群众欢迎。许多俱乐部还因地制宜、因时制宜地创造了多种多样生动活泼的文娱活动形式。如创造了大树报、石板报、流动大字报、鼓动牌、土广播等，这些活动在田间地角、会前会后，在火塘边、月光下都可进行。
    这些活动都紧密地结合各个时期的政治任务和生产活动，以真人真事为题材，及时反映现实。因此，既丰富了各族农民的生活，又能很好地为工作和生产服务。大理白族自治州洱海之滨的永福农业社俱乐部，在今年春节用春联、喜报、漫画在水利工地上进行宣传鼓动，民工的劳动劲头更大了。
    通过五千个俱乐部的活动，在各个民族中培养了许多艺术人才。在约七万个群众业余文化活动积极分子中，产生了各族农民的诗人、作家、歌手、画家和许多优秀演员。傣族民间歌手康郎师，他创作的有些诗歌曾经被五个国家翻译转载。白族老艺人杨汉，演唱“大本曲”（说唱词），可唱几天几夜，群众百听不厌。
