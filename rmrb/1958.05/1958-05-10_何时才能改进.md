    When Will Improvements Be Made?
    The Wage Bureau of the Central Ministry of Labor is not handling letters from the people responsibly enough. We have given the bureau our opinions and written big-character posters, hoping that the bureau would examine itself and improve. However, to our surprise, on April 4th, we received another thirteen letters from the people forwarded by the bureau. These letters were all written by factory and mine workers, and most of them could have been promptly forwarded to the local authorities for handling. However, the bureau had kept them for a long time before forwarding them to us. The delay was generally about two months. Some problems had already been solved by us, but they were still forwarded to us. For example, Chen Guirong, an apprentice at the Third Engineering Department of the Hebei Provincial First Construction Engineering Company in Beijing, wrote a letter to us on January 16th, and another letter to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions on January 14th. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions forwarded it to the Ministry of Labor, but the Wage Bureau of the Ministry of Labor kept the letter for more than seventy days before forwarding it to us. The problem raised by Chen Guirong had already been dealt with by us on February 6th.
    In addition, some letters from the people that should not have been forwarded to us were also forwarded to us. For example, Beijing No. 211 Factory suggested that the current overtime allowance method be revised. This should have been studied and handled by the Wage Bureau of the Ministry of Labor (because this issue is stipulated by the Ministry of Labor), but the bureau forwarded the letter to us.

    何时才能改进
    中央劳动部工资局处理人民来信不够负责。我们曾给该局提出过意见，写过大字报，希望该局检查改进。但是，出乎我们意料之外，在4月4日我们又接到了该局一次转来的十三封人民来信，这些信都是厂矿职工写的，其中绝大部分都可以及时转到当地处理，该局却积压了很长时间之后才转给我们。积压的时间一般在两个月左右。有的问题，我们早已解决，但又转给我们。例如：在京的河北省第一建筑工程公司第三工程处的学徒陈贵荣在今年1月16日写了封信给我们，1月14日写了一封信给全国总工会，全国总工会转给了劳动部，但劳动部工资局一直将这封信积压了七十多天才转给我们，而陈贵荣所提出的问题我们早在2月6日就处理了。
    另外，有些不应该转给我们的人民来信也转给我们了。例如：北京二一一厂建议对现行的加班加点津贴办法进行修改，这本应由劳动部工资局研究处理（因为此问题是劳动部规定的），但该局把这封信转给了我们。
