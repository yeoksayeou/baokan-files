　　Xinjiang to Build Over a Hundred Small Blast Furnaces This Year
　　Bayi Steel Plant Creates Miracles Through Simple Means

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, 14th – The Bayi Steel Plant in Xinjiang, currently the only integrated iron and steel enterprise in Northwest China, has set an example for breaking down mystical viewpoints and conditionalism, and for developing small-scale iron and steel plants through simple means.

　　Construction of the Bayi Steel Plant in Xinjiang began in 1951. During the construction period, it only cost over six million yuan to build an integrated enterprise capable of producing iron and steel. The workshops for steelmaking, rolling, and hydropower used renovated old factory buildings, and the enterprise's machinery and equipment were pieced together from old equipment collected from many factories. The iron ore used was also of very low grade. Some people at the time believed it was fundamentally impossible to refine iron and steel using such makeshift equipment and inferior raw materials. However, the workers, transferred from the military, carried forward the People's Liberation Army's traditional spirit of hard work, and, guided by the idea of technology serving equipment and raw materials, finally broke down the conditionalism of the iron and steel industry. According to regulations, the iron content of the ore for steelmaking should not be less than 40%, and the coke strength should not be less than 280 kilograms. However, the ore used by this plant had an iron content of only 31%, and the coke produced by indigenous methods had a maximum strength of only 70 kilograms. They used the indigenous method of stacking a layer of ore and a layer of coal in the open air to roast it, replacing sintering equipment. Then, they used a hammer to crush the roasted ore, removing rocks and oxides to replace mechanical ore dressing equipment. This indigenous method similarly enabled the ore's iron content to reach 40%, and qualified pig iron was produced.

　　The plant's steelmaking workers, with their innovative spirit, successfully researched and developed a converter side-blowing operation method and modified the converter structure to a vortex drum shape, solving the technical problem of converters in China not being able to use high-phosphorus pig iron to make steel. This method has been promoted by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry to enterprises across the country that use converters for steelmaking. Last year, the plant's workers also made spring steel in the converter, which had previously been thought to only be smelted in open-hearth and electric furnaces.

　　Ironmaking and steelmaking require a lot of refractory materials. This plant adopted the method of obtaining materials locally, using very little investment to build three earthen kilns and one chimney, thus establishing a refractory material workshop. Using dolomite produced in Xinjiang to replace magnesia, asphalt to replace bittern, and using donkeys and camels to transport clay, they made various refractory bricks, which not only solved the need for all the refractory materials required for steelmaking and ironmaking but also met the needs of other local factories and mines.

　　People with a conditionalist mindset who had previously seen the plant's rolling equipment believed that it could only roll small round steel bars of 20 millimeters or less. However, in recent years, they have been able to roll more than 130 varieties of steel each year and have even rolled technically complex plowshare steel, channel steel, and two-inch angle steel. Their method of using small ingots and small rolling mills to roll a variety of products to meet the needs of local industrial construction has provided valuable experience for small iron and steel enterprises.

　　Iron and steel industry technology has always had a mysterious impression on the general public, but building small iron and steel industries is not as complicated as people imagine. During the construction of this plant, apart from one smelting engineer and one rolling engineer, all the workers were veterans transferred from the military. During the construction period, the plant sent a group of cadres with a junior high school education or above and soldiers with an elementary school education to Anshan, Shijingshan, and Chongqing to learn steelmaking, ironmaking, coking, and rolling. After studying for half a year or more, they returned to the plant to operate the machines while simultaneously training apprentices in production.

　　Under such conditions, the Bayi Steel Plant has not only solved the technical difficulties of product quality over the years but also continuously improved its output. Under the condition of very poor raw materials, the effective volume utilization coefficient of the ironmaking blast furnace has dropped from 2.966 at the beginning of the furnace to below zero, catching up with advanced blast furnaces. The daily pig iron output has more than doubled compared to the first few years of the furnace. A large number of products have supported the industrial and agricultural production and construction of the Xinjiang region.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, May 15th – The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is about to start construction of ten small iron smelting blast furnaces and one hundred indigenous blast furnaces in an effort to quickly provide pig iron for the manufacture of local industrial machinery equipment and agricultural machinery for the region, while also supporting the local industrial construction of the northwestern provinces. It is expected that by the fourth quarter of this year, five of these small blast furnaces will be put into production successively, and the indigenous blast furnaces can all be completed in the second half of the year.

　　The problems of infrastructure installation and production technicians for the ten iron smelting blast furnaces to be built by various special districts and autonomous prefectures in Xinjiang this year will be solved separately by the Bayi Steel Plant in Xinjiang and the Kashgar Farm Tool Factory, and other units; after they are completed, they can produce more than one hundred and forty tons of iron per day. The designs for the one hundred indigenous blast furnaces being built by handicraft cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives in various places have recently been completed by the Bayi Steel Plant. This plant successfully designed an indigenous blast furnace based on the small blast furnace format, which only requires one ton of rubble as the furnace bottom, and is made by stacking more than three hundred adobe bricks to form the furnace body and hearth, and then using quartz sand, coke powder, and crucible clay mixed into refractory mud and pasting a layer inside the hearth; It uses a bellows or hand-cranked blower as the air supply equipment. It only requires an investment of eighty yuan to build such an indigenous blast furnace with a volume of one cubic meter. This kind of indigenous blast furnace has many advantages over using crucible pots to refine iron: it can produce continuously for three to four days and can refine qualified cast iron.

　　天山南北　钢铁花开
    新疆今年兴建一百多座小高炉
    八一钢铁厂因陋就简屡创奇迹
    本报乌鲁木齐14日电　西北地区目前唯一的钢铁联合企业——新疆八一钢铁厂，为打破神秘观点和条件论、因陋就简地发展小型钢铁厂树立了榜样。
    新疆八一钢铁厂是1951年动工兴建的。建厂期间只花了六百多万元就建成了能生产钢铁的联合企业。它的炼钢、轧钢和水电三个车间使用的厂房是利用旧厂房补修成的，整个企业的机器设备都是从好多工厂东拼西凑起来的破旧设备。炼铁的矿石品位也很低。用这样拼凑起来的简陋设备和品位低劣的原料来炼铁、炼钢，当时有些人认为这是根本不可能的事情。但从部队上转业的职工发扬了人民解放军传统的苦干精神，本着技术为设备和原料服务的思想，终于打破了钢铁工业的条件论。按规定，炼钢的原矿石含铁量不能低于40％，焦炭强度不能低于二百八十公斤，但这个厂采用的矿石含铁量却只有31％；用土法炼出来的焦炭强度最高只七十公斤。他们采用在露天堆一层矿石，加一层煤来野烧的土办法，代替烧结设备，然后拿铁锤敲碎烧过的矿石，除去岩石和氧化物，以代替机械选矿设备。这种土办法同样使矿石含铁量达到40％，炼出了合格的生铁。
    这个厂的炼钢职工以独创精神研究成功了转炉侧吹的操作法，并把转炉结构改为涡鼓形，解决了我国转炉过去一直不能用高磷生铁炼钢的技术问题。这种方法已被冶金工业部推广到全国使用转炉炼钢的企业。去年这个厂的职工又在转炉里炼成了过去一直认为只有平炉和电炉才能冶炼的弹簧钢。
    炼铁和炼钢需要很多耐火材料，这个厂采用就地取材的办法，用极少的投资修建了三个土窑、一个烟筒，建成一座耐火材料车间。用新疆出产的白云石代替镁砂，沥青代替盐卤，用毛驴、骆驼运来粘土，制成各种耐火砖，不仅解决了炼钢和炼铁所需的全部耐火材料，而且满足了当地其他厂矿的需要。
    抱有条件论的人过去看了这个厂的轧钢设备，认为只能轧制二十个米厘以下的小圆钢，但他们这几年每年都能轧制一百三十多样品种的钢材，而且轧成了技术复杂的犁铧钢、槽钢和二吋角钢。他们利用小钢锭和小型轧钢机轧制多种花色满足地方工业建设需要的操作方法，给小型钢铁企业提供了较好的经验。
    钢铁工业技术对一般人一直有神秘的印象，但建设小型钢铁工业并不像人们想像中那样复杂。这个厂在兴建期间除了一个冶炼工程师和一个轧钢工程师，所有职工都是来自部队的转业军人。建厂期间厂里派出了一批相当中学以上文化程度的干部和具有初小程度的战士，分别到唐山、石景山、重庆学习炼钢、炼铁、炼焦和轧钢，他们学了半年或一年多之后，就回到厂里一面操纵机器生产，一面在生产中带徒弟。
    八一钢铁厂在这样的条件下，几年来不仅解决了产品质量的技术困难，而且不断提高了产量。炼铁高炉在原料很坏的条件下，有效容积利用系数已从开炉时二点九六六降到零点以下，赶上了先进的高炉。生铁日产量比开炉最初几年提高了一倍以上。以大量的产品支援了新疆地区的工农业生产和建设事业。
    新华社乌鲁木齐15日电　新疆维吾尔自治区即将动工兴建十个小型炼铁高炉和一百个土高炉，争取尽快地为本区制造地方工业机器设备、农业机具提供生铁，同时支援西北各省的地方工业建设。预计到今年第四季度，这些小高炉将有五个陆续投入生产，土高炉在下半年可以全部建成。
    今年新疆各专区、自治州兴建的十个炼铁高炉的基建安装和生产技术人员问题，将由新疆八一钢铁厂和喀什农具厂等三个单位分别包干解决；它们建成以后，每天能产生铁一百四十多吨。各地手工业社和农业社兴建的一百个土高炉，最近已经由八一钢铁厂作出设计。这个厂根据小高炉形式设计成功的土高炉，只需一吨片石作炉底，用三百多块土坯砌成炉身和炉缸，再用石英砂、焦炭末和坩子土搅拌成耐火泥在炉缸内部贴一层就成了；它采用风箱或手摇鼓风机作为送风设备。建成这样一个一立方公尺容积的土高炉，只要八十元投资。这种土高炉比采用坩子锅炼铁好处多：它可以连续生产三天到四天，并且能炼出合格的铸造生铁。
