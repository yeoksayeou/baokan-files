Summer Great Production, Learning Not Relaxed
Jiangsu Rural Areas Appear in Cultural Learning Upsurge

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th: In Jiangsu Province, more than 9.4 million young and middle-aged illiterate people are persisting in cultural learning during the busy summer great production, of which more than 1.9 million have recently graduated from literacy classes. At present, this large-scale mass literacy campaign is shifting from full mobilization to a comprehensive consolidation and improvement stage. In areas where illiteracy has been eliminated, efforts are being made to organize the masses to read popular books and newspapers and actively carry out amateur cultural activities. After literacy, the broad masses of workers and peasants have begun to play an active role in improving technology, improving production management, and enlivening the cultural life of factories and rural areas.

Jiangsu's rural areas have now entered the busiest and most intensive production season of the year, but learning goes wherever production goes, and 98.1% of the province's young and middle-aged illiterate people have enrolled in school. In literacy learning, due to the broad masses' understanding that learning is to promote production and better build socialism, unprecedented enthusiasm and consciousness have emerged in learning. Thousands of people are working hard and practicing diligently with a tenacious spirit. They have come up with many learning methods that combine with production and many methods that learn quickly and well. In the Huaiyin area, more than 1.4 million enrolled young and middle-aged illiterate and semi-literate people are using all spare time to carry out literacy learning. They are planning to use time before and after meetings, before and after meals, evenings and mornings, rest time in the fields, and production gaps to learn, achieving less learning when very busy, more learning when less busy, less learning on sunny days, more learning on rainy days, and full learning when not busy, and persisting in learning every day. The masses have also compiled many flexible and diverse field textbooks in conjunction with production, so that production drives learning, and learning promotes production. The masses in Liuhe Township, Xin Hailian City, have also created a rich and colorful literacy environment, achieving literacy by looking up and recognizing words by seeing objects. The masses have also compiled many vivid rhymes, such as "Thousand-year-old high mountains wear green coats, vast oceans teem with fish and crabs, men, women, old and young are busy with production, everyone is in high spirits for learning, mountains smile, seas laugh, the forty articles pave the way for us," the masses learned culture and also encouraged production enthusiasm.

In the current busy and intensive production season, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee has made comprehensive arrangements for production and learning, including literacy work on the Party Committee's agenda, unified deployment with other work, unified inspection, and unified evaluation. Party Committee secretaries and administrative heads are personally taking charge to strengthen leadership. Local Party committees are following the mass line in leading literacy work, fully mobilizing the masses, and extensively carrying out publicity and education to stimulate the masses' conscious learning enthusiasm.

　　夏季大生产　学习不放松
    江苏农村出现文化学习高潮
    据新华社南京11日电　江苏省有九百四十多万青壮年文盲在繁忙的夏季大生产中坚持文化学习，其中一百九十多万人已在最近扫盲毕业。目前，这个大规模的群众识字运动正从全面发动进入全面巩固提高阶段，在已经扫除文盲的地区正大力组织群众开展通俗书报的阅读工作，积极开展业余文化活动。广大工农群众识字以后，对提高技术，改善生产管理，活跃工厂、农村文化生活等方面已开始起积极的推动作用。
    江苏农村目前已进入一年中最繁忙紧张的生产季节，但是生产到哪里，学习到哪里，全省98.1％的青壮年文盲都已入学。在扫盲学习中，由于广大群众认识到学习是为了促进生产，更好地建设社会主义，在学习上出现了空前的积极性和自觉性，成千上万的人都以顽强的精神勤学苦练，他们想出了很多与生产结合的学习办法，想出了许多学得快、学得好的办法。淮阴专区一百四十多万已经入学的青壮年文盲和半文盲，利用一切空隙时间开展扫盲学习。他们有计划地运用会前、会后，饭前、饭后，晚间、早上，田头休息时间和生产空隙进行学习，做到大忙少学，小忙多学，晴天少学，雨天多学，不忙全学，坚持天天学习。群众还结合生产编了很多灵活多样的田头教材，使生产带动了学习，学习又推动了生产。新海连市柳河乡的群众还布置了一个丰富多彩的识字环境，做到抬头识字，见物识字。群众还编了很多生动的顺口溜，如“千年高山披绿袄，万顷海洋鱼蟹跃，男女老少忙生产，个个学习情绪高，山也笑，海也笑，四十条给我们铺平康庄道”，群众既学了文化又鼓动了生产热情。
    在当前生产紧张繁忙的季节中，江苏省各级党委把生产、学习作了全面的安排，将扫盲工作列入党委的议程，和其他工作统一布置，统一检查，统一评比，党委书记和行政负责人都亲自挂帅加强领导。各地党委在领导扫盲中走群众路线，充分发动群众，广泛开展宣传教育启发群众自觉的学习积极性。
