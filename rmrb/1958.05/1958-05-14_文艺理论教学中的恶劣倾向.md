　　Bad Tendencies in Literary Theory Teaching
    Currently, there are two serious bad tendencies in literary theory teaching in the Chinese departments of universities: emphasizing the ancient and belittling the modern, and disregarding politics and being divorced from reality.
    When teachers lecture on major issues such as the essence of literature, the social nature of literature, the typical, and the image, the examples they cite, if foreign, are always from Balzac, Leo Tolstoy, or Gogol; at the most recent, "Mother" by Gorky. If Chinese, it's always "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," or "The Scholars"; at the most recent, Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q." It is right to use these works as examples. However, why not use or rarely use some Soviet literary works after the October Revolution, and Chinese literary works after the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, especially literary works after the founding of New China, as examples? And newly published or released works are never mentioned at all.
    Secondly, teachers in their lectures or lecture notes only talk about the articles of Marx, Lenin, Chairman Mao and other revolutionary teachers and other classic writers. This is of course correct and necessary. The problem is: on specific issues, theory is not used to evaluate new works, and there is no comment on the controversial issues in the current literature and art; on theoretical issues, various bourgeois idealist theories are not criticized, and even the principled issues that rightists and revisionists argue against us are not looked at. One teacher, in the literary outline teaching in the second half of 1957, lectured on the essence of literature, the party spirit of literature, political nature, the writer's world view and other important issues, but never criticized Feng Xuefeng's "theory" on these issues.
    Why do teachers do this? I think there are only two situations: one is that although they speak of Marxism-Leninism, they still think of idealism in their hearts. The other situation is that they disregard politics and are divorced from reality. These people have forgotten the principle of "no destruction, no construction" and "no plugging, no flow." Double-track railway lines are excellent, but double-track literary lines cannot last forever.

### 文艺理论教学中的恶劣倾向

　　文艺理论教学中的恶劣倾向
    目前，在大学中文系的文艺理论教学中，存在着两种严重的恶劣倾向：厚古薄今和漠视政治、脱离实际。
    教师在讲授文学的本质、文学的社会性、典型、形象这类重大问题时，列举的例子，外国的，不是巴尔扎克，便是列夫·托尔斯泰或果戈理的作品，最近的，也是高尔基的“母亲”；中国的不是“红楼梦”，便是“水浒”或“儒林外史”，最近的，也是鲁迅先生的“阿Q正传”。举这些作品作例子都是应该的。但是，为什么不举或很少举些十月革命后的苏联文学作品，和延安文艺座谈会后的中国文学作品，特别是新中国成立后的文学作品作例子呢？而且新近出版或发表的作品，就根本不为人所提及。
    其次，教师在自己的讲义或讲授中，只讲一些马克思、列宁、毛主席等革命导师和其他经典作家的条文。这当然是对的、必要的。问题在于：在具体问题上，不用理论去评价新作品，对目前文艺上有争论的问题不置可否；在理论问题上，对各式各样的资产阶级的唯心主义理论不批驳，连右派分子、修正主义分子跟我们针锋相对的原则问题都不看一字。有一个教师，在1957年下半年的文学概论教学中，讲授了文学的本质、文学的党性、政治性、作家的世界观等重要问题，却从未批判过冯雪峰关于这些问题的“理论”。
    教师为什么要这样做呢？我想不外两种情况：一种是嘴里虽讲的是马列主义，心里却还是想的唯心主义。另一种情况，就是因为漠视政治、脱离实际。这些人忘记了“不破不立”、“不塞不流”这个道理，双轨的铁路线，是再好不过的，双轨的文艺路线却是不能长存的。
