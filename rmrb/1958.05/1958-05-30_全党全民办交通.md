The whole Party and the entire people should run transportation
Technical revolution and great leap forward
Integrated development of land, water, and air
Transportation network extending in all directions

    With the arrival of the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in national production and construction, the transportation industry, as the material pillar connecting industrial and agricultural production, has also seen a high tide of the Great Leap Forward throughout the country. The main signs of this high tide are: the people of the whole country and the vast number of workers have shown an unprecedented enthusiasm and drive for transportation construction; and many local Party committees and governments have paid attention to grasping transportation work.

The spirit of making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way
The spirit of the Foolish Old Man who moved mountains and Jingwei who filled the sea

    In his work report to the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi called for "establishing a comprehensive transportation network throughout the country with modern tools as the main means." All parts of the country are working hard to realize this great call. Since last winter, a situation of common leaps forward in production and transportation has emerged in many places, and road construction and river dredging are in full swing everywhere. Some people dig rivers in very cold weather; others engage in production during the day and process and repair roads at night. In many places, in order to implement "vehicularization" and "shipping," and change the transportation methods of carrying on shoulders, the masses enthusiastically contributed ideas, materials, and labor, with lights all over the mountains at night and lights on in every household all night long, forming a situation where "every family is a factory and everyone is a carpenter." In many places, the secretaries of the prefectural and county committees personally took the lead in going up the mountains to build roads, going down the rivers to dig rivers, and building ships and vehicles. Between special districts, counties, townships, and communes, the waves of mutual learning and mutual evaluation in transportation construction rose one after another. The deeds of women, youths, and old people participating in road construction, river digging, and shipbuilding and vehicle manufacturing can be seen everywhere. Even some women went to repair roads on the night of their wedding day; and some people took out the coffin materials they had saved for many years to build vehicles. The revolutionary drive of the broad masses in carrying out transportation construction fully demonstrated the heroic spirit of "making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way."

    It is precisely because many local Party committees and governments have put transportation work on their agenda, and because of the "Foolish Old Man moving mountains" and "Jingwei filling the sea" spirit of the broad masses and cadres, that a vigorous "Great Revolution in Transportation" movement has been launched throughout the country. As a result, many long-standing problems have been solved; and many things that were considered impossible in the past have become reality. For example, in Paoma Township, Dangyang County, Hubei Province, during the high tide of water conservancy construction, "vehicularization" was realized in only three days, expanding water conservancy construction from the original 110,000 cubic meters of earthwork to 160,000 cubic meters. The masses said: "In previous years, when soil was carried on the shoulder, sweat dripped like raindrops. This year, we use vehicles to transport it, and our shoulders are relieved and people are lighter." From January to March this year, Zunyi County, Guizhou Province, has built 191 kilometers of simple roads and 336 kilometers of wide roads. All 19 districts and towns and 115 townships in the county have highways. More than 10 million workdays of labor are saved every year. In February this year, Han Gongdu Township, Changde County, Hunan Province, mobilized the masses to open ditches, dredge ports, and build ships. Within a month, it basically eliminated carrying on shoulders and realized "shipping" throughout the township. Each of the 25 agricultural production cooperatives can access shipping, saving 1.16 million transportation workdays every year. There are countless miracles that rapidly change the backwardness of China's transportation.

    The situation of the Great Leap Forward in the transportation industry fully demonstrates its great locality and mass character. It serves production and promotes production. Wherever there are people, wherever there is production, wherever there are materials, the transportation industry needs to extend to. In particular, highways and short-distance transportation methods on inland river tributaries, with crisscrossing transportation routes, penetrate into various economic regions and the smallest cargo production areas, directly relating to the production and life of the broad masses of people and relating to the people's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. It has extremely close relationships with the development of agriculture and local industries. "Difficulty in traveling" has been a long-term pain for the Chinese people. The broad masses have long yearned to change the inconvenience of transportation. Since ancient times, repairing bridges and roads and dredging rivers have been considered a virtue. When the people of the whole country, under the radiance of the Party's general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, have launched a high tide of industrial and agricultural production, their demands for transportation are even more urgent. For example, the broad masses of peasants said: "We are not afraid of producing thousands of catties of grain per mu, but we are afraid of carrying the surplus grain on our shoulders"; they also said: "To promote socialist agricultural tools, we must change the roads of the feudal era." Therefore, in order to realize the production leap forward targets, the broad masses first carried out the reform of field transportation, and developed from the reform of field transportation to the reform of transportation in the entire region. And the reform of transportation has promoted the Great Leap Forward in production. This is completely in line with the law.

Criticize the "vertical, specialized, high" line
Adhere to the "local, mass, universal" line

    These characteristics of the transportation industry require transportation workers to serve the production and life of the 600 million people wholeheartedly, and to serve the Great Leap Forward in agriculture and industry. They require transportation departments to resolutely rely on the localities and the broad masses to run the transportation industry well, and to give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the localities and the broad masses in carrying out transportation construction. They require Party committees and governments at all levels to strengthen their leadership over transportation work, and to arrange transportation work together with the arrangement of industrial and agricultural production.

    In the past, due to our low political level and lack of conscious understanding of the Party's general line of socialist construction with greater, faster, better, and more economical results; and due to the fact that we mostly talked about these characteristics of the transportation industry on the lips and did not further understand and pay attention to them in practice, we had some biases in our past work: we always focused on how to complete the transportation tasks and profit plans of existing vehicles and ships, while neglecting to fully consider how to better serve industrial and agricultural production from the perspective of 600 million people; we always focused our energy on a few directly affiliated enterprises and institutions, while relaxing the leadership over local transportation; we always tried to concentrate many powers in the ministry, and did not believe in local Party committees and governments; we always placed our hopes on professional construction forces, and did not believe in the broad masses; we always isolatedly managed a small number of modern transportation tools, while neglecting to utilize and transform a large number of backward transportation tools; we always overemphasized the construction of a few large ports and trunk highways, while neglecting to face the vast rural and mountainous areas and popularize transportation construction.

    In 1956, under the encouragement of Chairman Mao's policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the national transportation industry experienced a Great Leap Forward. Taking highway construction as an example, in the eight years after liberation, an average of 20,000 kilometers were built each year; in 1956 alone, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of local Party committees and governments, built 87,500 kilometers. At this time, we should have had a relatively deep understanding of the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but under the confusion of the so-called anti-"rash advance" wind, we wavered in our policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and some comrades also poured some cold water on it, which damaged the enthusiasm of cadres and the masses and affected the speed of transportation construction in 1957.

    Since September last year, due to the Party's reaffirmation of the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, the re-promulgation of the revised draft of the National Agricultural Development Program, Chairman Mao's combat call to catch up with Britain in fifteen years, and the drive and encouragement of the rectification movement, the transportation industry has seen the current larger-scale leap forward situation with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production.

    From the leap forward, conservatism, and greater leap forward experienced by the transportation industry in more than two years, we have clearly realized the correctness of the general line of building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results by going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results; we have seen our past shortcomings and the root causes of these shortcomings. What is the root cause of our problems? It is that we have not studied the works and instructions of Comrade Mao Zedong enough, our understanding is superficial, and there are serious empiricism and dogmatism in our thinking, lacking dialectical materialism and the mass viewpoint. In view of this, we have recently reviewed Comrade Mao Zedong's instructions on socialist construction. Although this study is not yet deep enough, we feel that we have gained great liberation in our thinking, enabling us to see clearly the path to building China's transportation industry with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, to understand who the transportation industry should serve and who it should rely on, and to recognize that there are also struggles between two different lines in building the socialist transportation industry. One line is to one-sidedly emphasize vertical leadership, emphasize administrative management, rules and regulations, emphasize specialization and standardization, and blindly pursue high standards and modernization. If we run the transportation industry according to this "vertical, specialized, high" line, it will inevitably lead to exclusive operation, taking on everything without actually doing anything, restricting the masses' hands and feet, relying solely on government investment, and being limited to a few points and lines, while neglecting the transportation construction of vast areas. The result is not greater, faster, better, and more economical results, but less, slower, worse, and more expensive results. The other line is the transportation construction line that relies on the localities, relies on the masses, and focuses on popularization. If we run the transportation industry according to this "local, mass, universal" line, we can give full play to the enthusiasm and creativity of local Party committees, governments, and the broad masses in transportation construction, rely on the whole Party and the entire people to run transportation, face the vast rural, mountainous, and remote areas, and popularize transportation construction. The result is fast speed and low cost. For example, the people of Ji County, Hebei Province, built a county-wide highway network with their own efforts, achieving "every township has a highway and every commune has access to large vehicles." The local government only subsidized 17% of the required funds, and the rest was self-funded by the masses. For another example, in order to dredge the upper reaches of the Qingjiang River, Hubei Province, the relevant departments organized a survey team to conduct multiple surveys. The original plan required an investment of 60,000 yuan and would not be navigable until 1962. In this wave of the Great Leap Forward, the masses of Wangying District, Lichuan County, under the personal leadership of the prefectural and county committee secretaries, only used three days and 200 kilograms of explosives to dredge 25 li. Practice has proved that this is a truly greater, faster, better, and more economical transportation construction line.

    Some transportation workers, until now, still hold a skeptical or opposing attitude towards the policy of the whole Party and the entire people running transportation and the "local, mass, universal" transportation construction line. Their reasons are "fear of too much, fear of chaos, and fear of competition." They believe that the "professionalism" of the transportation industry is very high and should be exclusively operated by the transportation department. It is better to have less so that it can be managed well; if the whole Party and the entire people run it, it will disrupt the transportation market and cause blind competition. These arguments run counter to the Party's construction line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Are you afraid of too much? In fact, the lack of roads, waterways, vehicles, and ships has become an obstacle to the Great Leap Forward in production. What's wrong with having more? Are you afraid that you can't manage it if there is too much? The only indicator to evaluate the quality of transportation work is to see whether it can better serve industrial and agricultural production. How can we talk about good when maintaining the backward situation of insufficient transportation capacity and hindering production? Are you afraid of chaos? Of course, the great development of transportation will inevitably bring many new problems; however, as long as we rely on the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels and pay attention to strengthening planned balance and mutual cooperation, the problems can be solved. Are you afraid of competition? We should believe that, due to the correct leadership of the Party and the continuous improvement of the communist consciousness of the masses, certain capitalist management ideas and localism and departmentalism tendencies that may occur can also be overcome. However, we must never regard the work competition of greater, faster, better, and more economical results as blind competition. Only right-leaning conservatives are afraid of this kind of competition. It can be seen that these arguments of "fear of too much, fear of chaos, and fear of competition" are completely untenable. In order to make the transportation industry keep up with the development of the new situation of the people's Great Leap Forward and better serve the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production and the production and life of 600 million people, we must implement the greater, faster, better, and more economical "local, mass, universal" transportation construction line, implement the whole Party and the entire people running transportation, and accelerate the speed of transportation construction.

    When implementing the whole Party and the entire people running transportation and implementing the "local, mass, universal" transportation construction line, we must conduct a comprehensive plan for transportation construction and incorporate this plan into the local overall national economic development plan. In the transportation construction plan, we should pay special attention to adapting to the development of agriculture and local industries, develop various regional transportation methods, face the vast rural, mountainous, and remote areas, and popularize the construction of local highway networks and waterway networks. We must first ensure that there are roads to pass through, bridges to cross, ports to berth, and rivers to navigate. The goal is to have boats and ships on all rivers, large and small, in the country, highways to towns and key locations, and large vehicles connecting townships and communes, so that goods can flow smoothly and travel is convenient. In order to ensure the smooth realization of the transportation construction plan, we believe that Party committees and governments at all levels should have special personnel to regularly lead transportation work. The reason why Ji County, Hebei Province, can achieve great results in transportation work is mainly because the county Party committee and government attach special importance to transportation work. A deputy secretary of the county Party committee, a deputy county head of the county people's committee, a deputy township head of the township, and a commune member of the agricultural cooperative are often responsible for leading transportation work. Their practice of having special personnel responsible from the county to the commune is worthy of promotion everywhere.

Carry out technical revolution, gradually realize mechanization and semi-mechanization, replace carrying on shoulders with vehicles and ships, and replace human power with animal power.

    While popularizing the construction of local transportation networks, we must also pay attention to the construction of various trunk line transportation. Trunk line transportation plays an important role in consolidating national defense and developing the national economy. Without trunk line transportation, the highways and small tributary rivers scattered throughout the country cannot be connected into a unified national transportation network. Railways, highways, water transportation, civil aviation, and other different transportation methods undertake different transportation tasks and play different roles in the national economy. Therefore, when implementing the whole Party and the entire people running transportation and implementing the "local, mass, universal" transportation construction line, we should also pay attention to the comprehensive utilization of various different transportation methods of water, land, and air. In areas with many rivers, we should pay attention to combining water conservancy construction and give priority to the development of water transportation; in areas without rivers, we should pay attention to connecting with railways, building highways and various local roads, and developing highway transportation; air transportation should try to open up new domestic and foreign air trunk lines, develop local air routes centered on provincial capitals, and make full use of the rapid and economical characteristics of civil aviation to actively serve industrial and agricultural production and vigorously develop professional flying (such as aerial photography, prospecting, fertilization, and pest control). In areas where several transportation methods are available, reasonable division of labor, close cooperation, and expansion of combined transportation should be carried out under the unified leadership of the local Party committee and government.

    When implementing the whole Party and the entire people running transportation and implementing the "local, mass, universal" transportation construction line, we should also gradually carry out technical transformation of the transportation industry. At present, in a large part of the transportation industry, the handicraft tools of the old era still occupy a dominant position, and the vast number of workers have not yet been liberated from heavy physical labor. In many places, more than 30%, and even 60% in some mountainous areas, of the labor force is engaged in transportation by carrying on shoulders; many of China's existing vehicle and ship types are still left over from thousands of years ago, with low load capacity, low speed, and high cost; in vehicle and ship loading and unloading, manual labor accounts for about 80%; in road construction, port construction, and vehicle and ship repair work, most of the operations are also manual. These backward transportation production methods have become an obstacle to further improving transportation efficiency and reducing costs and freight rates. Marx once pointed out that the revolution in agricultural and industrial production tools will inevitably lead to a revolution in transportation tools. Therefore, with the technological revolution in China's agriculture and industry, the transportation industry must also carry out technological revolution in a planned way. The goal of this revolution is, first of all, to promote mechanized and semi-mechanized transportation tools, gradually replace carrying on shoulders with vehicles and ships, replace human power with animal power, replace wooden sailboats with mechanical ships, promote four-wheeled carriages, machine-horse two-purpose vehicles (suitable for horse-drawn or car, tractor towing), and amphibious vessels, and select and manufacture new types of cars, ships, and airplanes suitable for different regions, different rivers, and different transportation tasks. In loading and unloading, road construction, port construction, and vehicle and ship repair work, we should also vigorously reform tools and gradually promote mechanical operation, and pay special attention to the mechanization of those heavy labor first.

    While carrying out the technical transformation of the transportation industry, we must also actively support the technical transformation of agriculture, implement technology to the countryside, help peasants reform field transportation tools, repair agricultural machinery, and pay attention to promoting the comprehensive utilization of tractors, irrigation and drainage machinery, water conservancy power generation, and transportation.

    When carrying out the technical transformation of the transportation industry, we must also implement the policy of greater, faster, better, and more economical results, mobilize the broad masses, the vast number of workers, and the members of transportation cooperatives to participate, pool their wisdom and efforts, and attack technical fortresses. In general, it is necessary to: mobilize the whole Party, mobilize the entire people, contribute ideas, contribute efforts, adapt to local conditions, be bold in creation, gradually improve, and standardize promotion.

    In short, the transportation industry must leap forward again and again under the shining light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and undertake the tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the state. Our fighting slogan is: "The whole Party and the entire people run transportation, technical revolution and Great Leap Forward, integrated development of land, water, and air, and transportation network extending in all directions."

    Of course, in realizing these leap forward goals, we will definitely encounter many difficulties. However, we believe that as long as we can achieve political command, improve leadership methods, face the whole country, go deep into reality, conscientiously implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, especially strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and let the brilliance of Comrade Mao Zedong's thought shine into every corner of the transportation system, we will surely be able to overcome any difficulties and realize the Great Leap Forward in the transportation industry.

    全党全民办交通
    交通部部长　王首道
    我们的奋斗口号是：
    全党全民办交通　技术革命大跃进  水陆空综合发展　运输网四通八达
    随着全国生产建设大跃进的新形势的到来，作为联系工农业生产的物质支柱的交通运输事业，也在全国范围内出现了一个大跃进的高潮。这个高潮的主要标志是：全国人民和广大职工表现了一种空前未有的进行交通建设的热情和干劲；许多地方党委和政府已注意抓交通运输工作。高山低头河水让路的气概愚公移山精卫填海的干劲
    刘少奇同志代表党中央委员会向第八届全国代表大会第二次会议的工作报告中，号召“在全国范围内建立一个以现代工具为主的四通八达的运输网”。全国各地正在为实现这个伟大的号召而努力。自去冬以来，许多地方已经出现了生产和交通共同跃进的局面，到处都在热火朝天地兴修道路、疏浚河道。有的在很冷的天气下水挖河；有的白天进行生产，晚上加工修路。许多地方为了实行“车子化”、“船运化”，改变肩挑人背的运输方式，群众踊跃地献计、献料、献力，夜间满山灯光，户户灯火通宵，形成“家家是工厂，人人是木匠”。许多地方的地委书记和县委书记亲自带头上山修路、下水挖河、造船造车。专县乡社之间，在交通建设上，相互学习，相互评比的声浪，此起彼伏，妇女青年老人参加修路挖河、造船造车的事迹，到处可见。甚至有的妇女白天刚结婚，晚上就去修路；有的人将自己保存了许多年的棺木料拿出来造车。广大群众这种进行交通建设的革命干劲，充分表现了“让高山低头，让河水让路”的英雄气概。
    正是由于许多地方党委和政府把交通运输工作列入了议事日程，由于广大群众和干部的这种“愚公移山”、“精卫填海”的干劲，在全国范围内，已经掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的“交通运输大革命”的运动。从而，许多长期不能解决的问题，得到了解决；许多过去认为不可能办到的事，已经成为现实。如湖北省当阳县跑马乡，在水利建设高潮中，只用了三天的时间，就实现了“车子化”，使水利建设由原来的十一万土方，扩大到十六万土方。群众说：“往年泥土一上肩，压得汗珠如雨点，今年改用车子运，肩膀歇架人轻便”。贵州省遵义县今年1至3月份，已经修了简易公路一百九十一公里，大车道三百三十六公里，全县十九个区镇，一百一十五个乡，都有了公路。每年节省劳动力一千万工日以上。湖南省常德县韩公渡乡，今年2月份发动群众开沟疏港，修造船只，在一个月内，也基本上消灭了肩挑人背，实现了全乡“船运化”。二十五个农业生产合作社，社社都能通船，每年可以节省一百一十六万个运输工。这种迅速改变我国交通落后面貌的奇迹，真是不胜枚举。
    交通事业这种大跃进的形势，充分表明了它具有很大的地方性、群众性，它既为生产服务，又对生产有促进作用。哪里有人民，哪里有生产，哪里有物资，交通事业就需要伸展到哪里去。特别是公路和内河支流短距离的运输方式，运输路线纵横交叉，深入到各个经济区域和最小的货物产地，直接关系到广大人民的生产和生活，关系到人民的衣食住行；对于农业和地方工业的发展，有着极其密切的关系。“行路难”是我国人民的长期痛苦。广大群众早就渴望着改变交通不便的情况。自古以来，修桥补路、疏浚河道，就被认为是一种美德。当全国人民在党的多快好省的总路线的照耀下，掀起了工农业生产高潮之后，他们对于交通运输的要求，就更为迫切。例如广大农民说：“不怕亩产千斤粮，就怕挑担送余粮”；他们还说：“推广社会主义的农具，必须改变封建时代的道路”。因此，广大人民为了实现生产跃进指标，首先进行了田间运输的改革，并从田间运输的改革发展到整个地区交通运输的改革。而交通运输的改革，又促进了生产事业的大跃进。这是完全合乎规律的。批判“直、专、高”的路线坚持“地、群、普”的路线
    交通事业的这些特点，要求交通运输工作者必须全心全意地为六亿人民的生产和生活服务，为农业和工业的大跃进服务；要求交通部门必须坚决依靠地方和广大群众办好交通事业，必须充分发挥地方和广大群众进行交通建设的积极性和创造性；要求各级党委和政府，必须加强对交通工作的领导，必须在安排工农业生产的同时，一并安排交通运输工作。
    过去由于我们的政治水平低，对于党的多快好省的社会主义建设路线缺乏自觉的认识；对于交通事业的这些特点，也多是在口头上谈谈，没有在实践中进一步地认识和注意，因此，我们在过去工作中，曾经发生了一些偏向：总是把眼光放在如何完成现有车船的运输任务和利润计划上，而忽视从六亿人口出发，全面考虑如何更好地为工农业生产服务；总是把精力放在少数的直属企业事业单位上，而放松了对于地方交通的领导；总企图把许多事权，都集中到部，而不相信地方党委和政府；总是把希望寄托在专业建设力量上，而不相信广大群众；总是孤立地管理少数近代运输工具，而忽视利用和改造为数众多的落后运输工具；总是过分强调少数大型港口和干线公路的建设，而忽视面向广大农村和山区，普及交通建设。
    1956年，全国交通事业曾经在毛主席多快好省的方针的鼓舞下，有过一次大跃进。以公路建设为例，解放后八年，平均每年修二万公里；仅1956年一年，全国人民在各地党委和政府领导下，就修了八万七千五百公里。这时，我们本来应该对多快好省的路线，有比较深刻的体会，但在所谓反“冒进”的一阵风的迷惑下，我们对多快好省的方针，又发生了动摇，有些同志也跟着浇了些冷水，以致伤害了干部和群众的积极性，影响了1957年交通建设的速度。
    自去年9月以来，由于党重申了多快好省的方针，由于农业发展纲要修正草案的重新公布，由于毛主席提出了十五年赶上英国的战斗号召，由于整风运动的带动和鼓舞，交通事业才随着工农业生产的大跃进，又出现了目前的更大规模的跃进形势。
    从交通事业在两年多的时间内，所经历的这种跃进、保守和更跃进的反复中，我们清醒地认识了鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的社会主义建设总路线的正确；看清了我们过去的毛病，也认识了发生毛病的根源。我们的病根是什么呢？就是我们对毛泽东同志的著作和指示学习不够，领会肤浅，在思想上存在着严重的经验主义和教条主义，缺乏辩证的唯物主义观点和群众观点。有鉴于此，我们在最近一个时期内，重温了毛泽东同志关于社会主义建设的指示。这次学习虽然还不够深刻，但我们感觉在思想上获得了很大的解放，使我们看清了多快好省地建设我国交通事业的途径，认识了交通事业应该为谁服务和依靠谁，认识了在建设社会主义交通事业上，同样存在着两条不同路线的斗争。一条路线是片面地强调垂直领导，强调行政管理、规章制度，强调专业化、正规化，盲目追求高标准、近代化。按照这条“直、专、高”的路线去办交通事业，就必然形成独家经营，包而不办，束缚群众手足，单纯依靠政府投资，局限在少数点线，而忽视广大地区的面的交通建设。其结果不是多快好省，而是少慢差费。另一条路线则是依靠地方，依靠群众，普及为主的交通建设路线。按照这条“地、群、普”的路线办交通事业，就可以充分发挥地方党委、政府和广大群众对交通建设的积极性和创造性，依靠全党全民办交通，面向广大农村、山区和偏僻地区，普及交通建设。其结果是速度快，花钱少。如河北蓟县人民就是用自己的力量建成了全县的公路网，做到了“乡乡有公路，社社通大车”。而当地政府只补助了所需资金的17％，其余都是群众自办。又如湖北省为了疏通清江河上游，曾由有关部门组织了勘测队进行多次勘测。原规划需投资六万元，并且要到1962年才能通航。而在这次大跃进的声浪中，利川县汪营区的群众，在地委、县委书记亲自带动下，只用了三天时间、二百斤炸药，就疏通了二十五华里。实践证明，这是一条真正多快好省的交通建设路线。
    有些交通工作人员，直到现在，对于全党全民办交通的方针和“地、群、普”的交通建设路线，还抱着怀疑或反对的态度。他们的理由就是“怕多、怕乱、怕争”。他们认为交通事业的“专业性很大”，应该由交通部门独家经营，宁可少一点，才能管好；让全党全民来办，就会把运输市场搞乱，就会发生盲目竞争。这些论调，是和党的鼓起干劲、力争上游、多快好省的建设路线，背道而驰的。怕多吗？事实上道路少、航道少、车少、船少，已经成为生产大跃进的障碍。多了又有什么不好呢？怕多了管不好吗？而评价交通工作好坏的唯一标志，是看它能否更好地为工农业生产服务。维持运力不足、障碍生产的落后情况，还谈得到什么好呢。怕乱吗？当然，交通运输的大发展，必然要带来许多新的问题；但是，只要依靠各级党委和政府的领导，注意加强计划平衡和相互协作，问题是可以得到解决的。怕竞争吗？应该相信，由于党的正确领导和群众共产主义觉悟的不断提高，可能发生的某些资本主义经营思想和地方主义、本位主义的倾向，也是可以加以克服的。但是，绝不能把比多快好省的工作竞赛，也看做是盲目竞争。只有右倾保守主义者才害怕这种竞赛。由此可见，这些“怕多、怕乱、怕争”的论调，是完全站不住脚的。为了使交通事业跟上全民大跃进的新形势的发展，更好地为工农生产的大跃进服务，为六亿人民的生产和生活服务，就必须贯彻多快好省的“地、群、普”的交通建设路线，实行全党全民办交通，加快交通建设速度。
    在实行全党全民办交通和贯彻“地、群、普”的交通建设路线时，必须进行交通建设的全面规划，并把这种规划作为当地整个国民经济发展规划的组成部分。在交通建设规划中，应特别注意适应农业和地方工业的发展情况，发展各种区域性的运输方式，面向广大农村、山区和偏僻地区，普及建设地方公路网和水运网。要首先作到有路可通，有桥可过，港能停泊，河能通航。使全国大小河流通舟楫，县城要镇有公路，乡社之间通大车；做到货畅其流，旅行方便。为了保证交通建设规划的顺利实现，我们认为各级党委和政府，都应有专人经常领导交通工作。河北蓟县所以能取得交通工作的巨大成绩，主要是由于该县党委和政府特别重视交通工作。县委有一位副书记、县人委有一位副县长、乡有一位副乡长、农业社有一名社务委员，经常负责领导交通工作，他们这种从县到社，都有专人负责的作法，值得各地推广。开展技术革命，逐步实现机械化半机械化，以车船代肩挑，以畜力代人力
    在普及建设地方运输网的同时，还必须注意各种干线运输的建设。干线运输对于巩固国防和国民经济的发展，都有重要作用，没有干线运输，分散在全国各地的公路和支流小河，就不能联结成全国统一的运输网。铁路、公路、水运、民航等不同的运输方式，担负着不同的运输任务，在国民经济中有着不同的作用。因此，在实行全党全民办交通，贯彻“地、群、普”的交通建设路线时，还应注意水、陆、空各种不同运输方式的综合利用。在河流众多的地区应注意结合水利建设，优先发展水运；没有河流的地区，应注意和铁路相互衔接，兴修公路和各种地方道路，发展公路运输；空运则应尽量开辟新的国内外航空干线，发展以省会为中心的地方航线，并充分利用民用航空快速、经济的特点，积极为工农业生产服务，大力发展专业飞行（如航空摄影、探矿、施肥、防治病虫害等）。在几种运输方式都有的地区，应在当地党委和政府统一领导下，合理分工，密切协作，扩大联运。
    在实行全党全民办交通，贯彻“地、群、普”的交通建设路线时，还应逐步进行交通事业的技术改造。目前在很大一部分交通运输业
  中，旧时代的手工工具还占着统治地位，广大的劳动者还没有从繁重的体力劳动中解放出来，许多地方经常有30％以上，有些山区甚至到60％以上的劳动力从事肩挑人背的运输；我国现有的车船型式，许多还是几千年前遗留下来的，载重少速度低，成本高；在车船装卸中，手工劳动约占80％左右；在筑路、筑港和车船修理工作中，也大部分是手工操作。这些落后的运输生产方式，已成为进一步提高运输效率和降低成本运价的障碍。马克思曾经指出过，农业和工业生产手段的革命，必然要引起交通手段的革命。因此，随着我国农业和工业的技术革命，交通运输业也必须有计划地进行技术革命。这个革命的目标，首先是推行机械化和半机械化的运输工具，逐步以车船代替肩挑人背，以畜力代替人力，以机械船代替木帆船，推广四轮马车、机马两用车（适用于马拉或汽车、拖拉机拖带）和水陆两用船，并选择和制造适用于不同地区、不同河流、不同运输任务的新型的汽车、轮船和飞机。在装卸、筑路、筑港和车船修理工作中，也应大力改革工具，逐步推行机械操作，特别要注意使那些笨重的劳动首先机械化。
    在进行交通事业技术改造的同时，还必须积极支援农业的技术改造，实行技术下乡，帮助农民改革田间运输工具，修理农业机械，并注意推行拖拉机、排灌机械、水利发电与交通运输的综合利用。
    在进行交通事业的技术改造时，也必须贯彻多快好省的路线，动员广大群众、广大职工和运输合作社的社员们都来参加，群策群力，猛攻技术堡垒。概括地说，就是要：全党动员、全民动手、有计出计、有力出力、因地制宜、大胆创造、逐步改进、定型推广。
    总之，交通事业一定要在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省的总路线的光辉照耀下，跃进再跃进，担负起党和国家所交付给我们的任务。我们的奋斗口号是：“全党全民办交通，技术革命大跃进，水陆空综合发展，运输网四通八达。”
    当然，在实现这些跃进目标时，一定还会遇到许多困难。但是，我们认为，只要我们能够做到政治挂帅，改进领导方法，面向全国，深入实际，认真贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，特别是努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，让毛泽东同志的思想光芒照耀到交通系统的各个角落，我们就一定能够克服任何困难，实现交通事业的大跃进。
