　　Technology combined with politics serves economic construction
    Tsinghua University's debate teaching thought
    (Our dispatch) A major debate on teaching ideology has fully unfolded among all teachers at Tsinghua University. To deepen the debate, spark ideological clashes, thoroughly examine the issues, and lay a solid foundation for the new teaching reform, the university's Party committee has called on teachers to thoroughly present their educational views and engage in extensive debate. On the evening of the 13th, the second meeting of the tenth-first teaching research conference was also held.

    Can technology be separated from politics?
    In the debate sessions of various teaching and research sections of the Architecture Department, as well as among all teachers, the focus was on "What is the core skill of an architect?" This issue fully demonstrated the struggle between two lines in teaching. Some teachers believed that "artistic composition is the core skill of an architect." "Artistic composition" can be separated from policies and guidelines. They believed that the school should mainly teach students "artistic composition" skills, and an architect only needs to be good at "composition." However, the "artistic composition" they pursued was essentially "artistic composition" that served the bourgeoisie. They advocated for "loosening up," that is, freely starting from the beauty of architectural composition, detaching from reality, imagining out of thin air, and freely developing; while they regarded the Party's architectural guidelines as a "tightening curse," "putting people in tight shoes," and "tightening up." However, many teachers pointed out that this was a bourgeois architectural education view that separated technology from politics. They believed that the result of practicing this bourgeois education ideology was: "loosening up" from the Party's policies, "loosening up" from comprehensive knowledge in architectural design, and "loosening up" from various bourgeois ideas, "loosening up" from both "redness" and "expertise." Under such a training policy, graduating students cannot draw correct ordinary construction detail drawings, and many students do not have the Party's guidelines and policies in mind; they are focused on pursuing luxurious displays and extravagant bourgeois lifestyles. These future "architects" trained in free development detached from reality feel constrained when they come into contact with real work.

    The so-called "genius education"
    In several basic course teaching and research sections, such as the Physics Teaching and Research Section, the Theoretical Mechanics Teaching and Research Section, and the Mathematics Teaching and Research Section, teachers debated the issue of "genius education" and the relationship between science and politics and production.

    When some teachers in the Physics Teaching and Research Section disseminated the view of "genius education" to students in teaching, they said: Scientists are equal to genius plus chance. They fundamentally opposed training students in a purposeful and planned manner. Many teachers' principle in dealing with students was strict elimination and hands-off management. They did not patiently teach students, but believed that good students have four standards, that is, they can listen to lectures they do not understand; they can do difficult problems; they can read books they do not understand; and they can work independently. Some teachers said that only by giving difficult problems to put pressure on students can the quality of students' level be identified. Some teachers said to students that if you completely understand what I teach, I am not a good teacher. Some teachers said, if I explain everything, what will the students do when they go home? They adopted an attitude of ignoring, not helping, scolding, and satirizing students with learning difficulties, and dealt with these students by giving failing grades and demotions. They regarded a large number of eliminations as a normal phenomenon, believing that without elimination, "genius" would not be revealed.

    Many teachers criticized this bourgeois "genius education" argument. They pointed out that the essence of this argument is to oppose serving socialist construction and to oppose training a large number of cadres in a purposeful and planned manner. This so-called "genius education" view not only cannot effectively train talents, but also often buries talented and promising young students, or guides them to a path of narrow knowledge and inability to develop comprehensively.

    Cannot only teach books but not teach people
    In the Electrical Engineering Department and the Gas Turbine Teaching and Research Section, teachers discussed the issue of teachers' political influence on students and the relationship between politics and professional work in the teaching and research section. Some teachers in the Electrical Engineering Department believed that students are young and politically stronger than older teachers, so how can teachers influence students politically? Before teachers have thoroughly transformed their thinking, can we have a division of labor, where teachers only teach books and Party and Youth League political work cadres teach people, that is, they believe that politics and professional work can be separated. Many teachers disagreed with this view, saying that the political and ideological influence of teachers on students cannot be underestimated. Because teachers have not thoroughly transformed their thinking, they intentionally or unintentionally promote the bourgeois individualistic outlook on life and worldview in the teaching process and in contact with students. Teachers' emphasis on professional work and neglect of politics, and emphasis on theory and neglect of practice, have already had a bad influence on a considerable number of students. Since the object of cultivation by teachers is cultured laborers with socialist consciousness, then teachers themselves must be both red and expert, and must comprehensively care for students, not only teaching books, but also teaching people.

    Teaching debate sessions in many departments and teaching and research sections are still going on fiercely.

　　技术结合政治为经济建设服务
    清华大学辩论教学思想
    本报讯　清华大学全校教师进行的一场教学思想大论战已经全面展开。为了使辩论深入进行，思想交锋，把问题辩得深、思想搞得透，给新的教学改革工作打下良好基础，学校党委号召教师们把自己的教育观点彻底地摆出来，展开大争大辩。13日晚上，并举行了第十一次教学研究会第二次会议。
    技术能脱离政治吗
    在建筑系各教研组以及全体教师的辩论会上，集中地辩论了“什么是建筑师的看家本领？”在这个问题上充分地表现了教学上两条路线的斗争。有的教师认为“艺术构图是建筑师的看家本领”。“艺术构图”可以脱离政策方针。他们认为学校里主要是教给学生“艺术构图”能力，一个建筑师，只要“构图好”就可以了。而他们所追求的“艺术构图”实质上却是为资产阶级服务的“艺术构图”。他们主张要“放”，就是要放手从建筑构图的美出发，脱离实际，凭空想像，自由发挥；而对党的建筑方针却看作是“紧箍咒”，是“给人穿小鞋”，是“收”。但是许多教师指出这是技术脱离政治的资产阶级建筑教育观点。他们认为，这种资产阶级教育思想实践的结果是：“放”掉了党的政策，“放”掉了建筑设计中的全面知识，而且“放”出种种资产阶级思想，既“放”掉“红”又“放”掉“专”。在这样的培养方针下面，快毕业的学生画不出正确的普通施工详图，不少学生头脑里没有党的方针、政策；一心追求的是豪华的排场和奢侈的资产阶级生活方式。这些在脱离现实自由发挥的情况下培养出来的未来“建筑师”一旦接触到现实工作，就感到束缚重重。
    所谓“天才教育”
    在物理教研组、理论力学教研组和数学教研组等几个基础课教研组中，教师们针对“天才教育”的问题和科学与政治和生产的关系展开了辩论。
    物理教研组的一些教师在教学中向学生散布“天才教育”的观点时说：科学家等于天才加偶然性。他们根本反对有目的有计划地培养学生。许多教师对待学生的原则是严格淘汰、放手不管。他们不去耐心地教导学生，而认为好学生有四个标准，即能听听不懂的课；能做难做的题目；能看看不懂的书；能独立工作。有的教师说，只有出难题把学生压一压，才能识别出学生程度的好坏。有的教师对学生说，教的你们完全懂了，就不是好先生。有的教师说，我如果都讲懂了，学生回家去做什么？他们对待学习困难的学生采取不理、不帮助、申斥、讽刺的态度，并且以给不及格的分数和降级来处理这些学生。他们把大量淘汰看成正常现象，认为不淘汰就显不出“天才”。
    许多教师批驳了这种资产阶级“天才教育”论点。他们指出这种论点的实质是反对为社会主义建设服务，反对有目的、有计划地大量培养干部。这种所谓“天才教育”的观点，不但不能有效地培养人才，而且往往把有才能、有希望的青年学生埋没了，或者引导到知识狭窄、不能全面发展的道路上去。
    不能只教书不教人
    在电机系和燃气轮机教研组，教师们讨论了教师在政治上对学生的影响问题和教研组中的政治和业务的关系问题。电机系有些教师认为学生年青，政治上比老教师还强，教师怎能在政治上去影响学生呢？教师的思想还未彻底改造之前，是否可以来个分工，教师只管教书，党团政治工作干部去教人，也就是认为政治和业务可以分家。许多教师不同意这种看法，他们说，教师对学生的政治思想影响是不能低估的，由于教师们没有彻底改造思想，在教学过程中以及和学生的接触中，有意无意地就宣扬了资产阶级个人主义的人生观和世界观。教师们重业务轻政治，重理论轻实际的思想，已经在相当一部分学生中造成了恶劣的影响。教师们既然培养的对象是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，那么教师自己就要又红又专，要全面关心学生，既要教书，也要教人。
    许多系和教研组的教学辩论会还正在激烈地进行着。
