Everyone Collects Seeds, Every Commune Raises Seedlings
    -- A Key to Promoting the Great Leap Forward in Afforestation
    Tu Guanghan, Engineer, Afforestation Bureau, Ministry of Forestry

A large-scale afforestation movement is unfolding across the country. Rapidly producing large quantities of tree seeds and seedlings is a major task in current and future forestry production. In many areas, seed and seedling supply is very tight and cannot keep up with the needs of afforestation because seed and seedling work has not been tightly grasped and the masses have not been sufficiently relied upon. Therefore, there must be a great leap forward in seed collection and seedling cultivation that is in line with the leap forward in afforestation. Based on the needs of afforestation, it should be done: what kind of forest to plant, what kind of seedlings to cultivate, what kind of seeds to collect; how much forest to plant, how many seedlings to cultivate, how many seeds to collect; and arrange seed and seedling production well.

Based on the estimation that more than 900 million mu of forest will be planted nationwide within three years, approximately 500 million jin of seeds need to be collected and 4 million mu of seedlings need to be cultivated each year. How to achieve this task? Who to rely on? There is only one way out, which is to boldly mobilize the masses to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings locally; everyone collects seeds, and every commune raises seedlings. For cooperatives to collect seeds and cultivate seedlings locally, to collect their own seeds and cultivate their own seedlings, is the best method to adapt to the situation of the great leap forward in afforestation in our country. Local seeds and seedlings are most suitable for local afforestation; at the same time, taking seeds and seedlings locally can avoid losses during transportation.

There are many favorable conditions for carrying out a mass seed collection and seedling cultivation movement. Many counties across the country have basically achieved that every commune has a nursery, and the seeds and seedlings needed for cooperative afforestation can be self-sufficient. The vast majority of counties have established model townships and communes with self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-afforestation, and have accumulated a lot of experience. Our country has a variety of tree species and abundant seed sources. Wherever there are trees, there are seed sources. As long as we overcome conservative thinking, boost revolutionary spirit, believe in the power of the masses, and make full use of favorable factors, the mass seed collection and seedling cultivation movement can be carried out smoothly on the basis of the great leap forward in afforestation.

In order to widely spread the cooperative seedling cultivation movement and complete the seedling cultivation task with guaranteed quality and quantity, several key links must be tightly grasped in the work.

I. Technical guidance work should be done well. Some areas use cooperatives with a better foundation in seedling cultivation as a base (or called a central nursery) to establish a seedling cultivation technology exchange network, organize technical instruction and experience exchange, and assign responsibility for guidance by area, so that seedling cultivation technology can be quickly mastered by the masses. The specific method is to divide each county into several areas, with dedicated cadres contracting for each area, responsible for technical guidance. Within each area, cultivate a key commune (the nursery of this key commune can be used as the cadre's seedling cultivation experimental field), set up a model, use a point to lead the area, and promote seedling cultivation in the entire area. In each seedling cultivation operation stage (such as sowing, tending and management, pest and disease control, seedling lifting, etc.), the key commune takes the first step, makes a model, and organizes seedling cultivators from various cooperatives in the area to observe and practice. In this way, in a very short period of time, they learn concretely and can do it when they return. In the process of seedling cultivation, when technical shortcomings are discovered, experience exchange meetings are organized in a timely manner to overcome the shortcomings. Forestry cadres should also conduct regular inspections and provide specific guidance. County state-owned nurseries should play a demonstrative and guiding role in cooperative seedling cultivation.

II. Strengthen the business management of cooperative seedling cultivation. Seedling cultivation should be included in the cooperative's production plan, and land, labor, and investment should be arranged in a unified manner. Seedling cultivation should be assigned to a dedicated person in charge, and a fixed labor organization should be established (establish a forestry production team or seedling cultivation group). All labor for seedling cultivation should be contracted to a professional group or individual to ensure timely attendance and good nursery management. Labor for seedling cultivation should be recorded, scored, and distributed profits uniformly with agriculture, and reasonable remuneration should be paid. Cooperatives with a better foundation in quota management can promote contracting for work, output, and cost; over-quota parts are rewarded with a percentage, stimulating the enthusiasm of commune members for seedling cultivation.

III. Diligently supervise and check, and promptly discover and solve problems. The majority of townships and communes in most areas are still unfamiliar with seedling cultivation and lack experience, and there are some specific difficulties that need to be resolved in a timely manner. Therefore, to carry out seedling cultivation in every commune, regular inspections should be conducted and cooperatives should be assisted in doing a good job in seedling cultivation. According to reports from various places, the lack of seeds for cooperative seedling cultivation is the most prominent problem at present. Therefore, it is necessary to grasp the situation of surplus and shortage of seeds, organize timely adjustments and exchanges, and ensure supply. All residual seeds on trees (such as black locust, tree-of-heaven, chinaberry, etc.) and those scattered and retained in the hands of farmers (such as chestnuts, walnuts, etc.) can be vigorously collected as needed to ensure that every grain is returned home and that seedling cultivation needs are met first. For seeds that mature in late spring and early summer, such as poplar, willow, elm, and mulberry, pay attention to correctly grasping the seed maturity period and collecting them in a timely manner; at the same time, prepare the nursery beds in advance and sow them immediately after collection. The amount of seeds used for seedling cultivation can be appropriately reduced, which can save seeds and expand the seedling cultivation area.

Tools, fertilizers, medicines, materials, etc. required for cooperative seedling cultivation should be prepared properly. In addition to using general farm tools for seedling cultivation, attention should also be paid to promoting some new seedling cultivation tools. For example, ridge-forming plows, compaction rollers, hand-push cylindrical seeders, three-row weeding hoes, wire soil rakes, combined shovel plows, and interchangeable seedling-lifting knives are all better tools that can ensure operation quality and improve work efficiency, and various places can study and promote them.

IV. Adapt to local conditions and adopt various forms according to different tree species to meet the needs of the great leap forward in seedling cultivation. Establishing nurseries with a commune as a unit is the basic form of developing cooperative seedling cultivation. Cooperatives with small afforestation tasks, places that lack experience in seedling cultivation, or areas where the masses have a habit of buying and selling seedlings can adopt the method of one commune raising seedlings and several communes guaranteeing sales or several communes jointly raising seedlings according to the situation. In addition to selecting flat terrain and places with good soil quality to develop small nurseries for intensive management, cooperatives can also adopt other methods adapted to local conditions. Xia County, Shanxi Province, created the experience of using vacant land in front of and behind houses and flower pots and flower beds to carry out small-scale seedling cultivation activities, achieving that everyone takes action and every household raises seedlings, ensuring the supply of seedlings. In southern areas, when cultivating fir seedlings, and in northern areas, when cultivating pine and arborvitae seedlings, use mountain slopes with deep soil and moist soil to develop temporary nurseries (called mountain seedling cultivation by the masses), achieving on-site seedling cultivation and on-site afforestation, which can improve the quality of afforestation. The masses in Yuzhong and Dingxi, Gansu Province, build terraced fields on slopes, divert mountain floodwaters for irrigation, and cultivate drought-resistant tree species, opening up broad avenues for the greening of arid mountains. These methods can be promoted according to local conditions.

Seedlings can be cultivated using sexual reproduction methods (i.e., sowing seedling cultivation methods) or asexual reproduction methods such as cuttings, burying branches, retaining roots, and dividing roots (mainly tree species with strong sprouting ability such as poplar, willow, French sycamore, camphor, etc.). Sexual reproduction does have many advantages and can produce more and better seedlings, which we should actively promote; however, in the current situation of a great leap forward in seedling cultivation and a shortage of seeds, asexual reproduction methods should not be completely excluded.

At present, in addition to seizing the opportunity to continue organizing seedling cultivation and sowing in the south, attention should also be paid to strengthening the tending and management of existing nurseries, drought resistance and drainage, and pest and disease control; various places in the north should closely combine the afforestation movement and seize the seedling cultivation work together. Prepare the nursery beds, organize the seed supply and technical instruction well, so as to promptly seize the moisture and sow early, and strive for full emergence and abundant yield.

    人人采种，社社育苗
    ——促进造林事业大跃进的一个关键
    林业部造林局工程师　涂光涵
    大规模造林运动正在全国展开。迅速生产大量的树种、苗木，是当前和今后林业生产上一件大事。许多地区由于种苗工作抓的不紧，依靠群众不够，种苗供应很紧张，跟不上造林的需要。因此必须来一个与造林跃进相适应的采种、育苗上的大跃进。根据造林的需要，应该做到：造什么林，育什么苗，采什么种；造多少林，育多少苗，采多少种；安排好种苗生产。
    根据全国三年内要造林九亿多亩来推算，每年大约需要采集种子五亿斤，培育苗木四百万亩。怎样实现这一任务？依靠谁？出路只有一条，就是放手发动群众，就地采种，就地育苗；人人采种，社社育苗。合作社就地采种，就地育苗，自己采种，自己育苗，是适应于我国造林大跃进形势的最好的方法。当地的种子、苗木，最适于当地造林；同时就地取用种苗，可免去调运过程中的损耗。
    开展一个群众性的采种育苗运动，是有着许多有利条件的。全国已有不少县份基本上达到了社社有苗圃，合作社造林所需种苗能够自给自足。绝大多数的县都有了群众自采自育自造的典型乡、社，树立了样子，并且积累了很多经验。我国树种多样，种源丰富，有树木，就有种源。只要克服保守思想，鼓起革命干劲，相信群众力量，充分利用有利因素，在造林大跃进的基础上，群众性的采种、育苗运动一定能够顺利开展起来。
    为使合作社育苗运动广泛铺开，并且保质保量地完成育苗任务，在工作中必须紧紧掌握住几个环节。
    一、要做好技术指导工作。有些地区以育苗基础较好的合作社作基点（或称为中心苗圃）建立育苗技术交流网，组织技术传授和经验交流，分片负责，分片指导，使育苗技术迅速为群众所掌握。具体作法是以县为单位，划分若干片，由专责干部按片包干，负责技术指导，在每一片内，培养一个重点社（这个重点社的苗圃可以作为干部的育苗试验田），树立典型，以点带面，推动全片育苗。在每一个育苗作业阶段（如播种、抚育管理、病虫害防治、起苗等），重点社先走一步，作出样子，组织片内各合作社育苗员观摩实习。这样用很短的时间，学的具体，回去就能做。在育苗过程中，发现技术上的缺点时，及时组织经验交流会，及时克服缺点。林业干部还要巡回检查，具体指导。县国营苗圃应对合作社育苗起示范和指导作用。
    二、要加强合作社育苗的经营管理。育苗应纳入合作社的生产计划之内，统一安排苗圃地、劳力和投资。育苗要指定专人负责，并固定劳动组织（成立林业生产队或育苗小组）。育苗的全部用工，应该由专业小组或个人一包到底，以保证及时出工，做好苗圃管理。育苗用工，应与农业统一记工分红，合理付酬。定额管理基础较好的合作社，可推行包工、包产、包成本；超额部分提成奖励，刺激社员育苗的积极性。
    三、要勤督促、勤检查，及时发现问题和解决问题。多数地区的乡、社对育苗业务还很生疏，缺乏经验，有一些具体困难，需要及时给予解决。因此，开展社社育苗，应该经常检查，并协助合作社做好育苗工作。据各地反映，合作社育苗的种子缺乏，是当前最突出的问题。因此要掌握种子余缺情况，及时组织调剂串换，保证供应。凡是树上有残存的（如洋槐、臭椿、苦栋等）和分散留存在农民手中的（如板栗、核桃等）都可根据需要，大力收集，做到颗粒还家，尽先满足育苗需要。春末夏初成熟的种子如杨、柳、榆、桑等树种，要注意正确掌握种子成熟时期，及时采集；同时要提早准备好圃地，随采集随播种。育苗的用种量，可适当压低，这样可以节约用种，扩大育苗面积。
    合作社育苗所需用的工具、肥料、药料、物料等，都要准备妥当。育苗除了利用一般农具外，还要注意推广一些育苗新式工具。例如培埂犁、镇压滚、手推圆筒播种器、三行耘锄、铁丝杜土耙、综合号铲趟机、换装起苗刀等，都是较好的工具，能保证作业质量和提高工作效率，各地可以研究推广。
    四、要因地制宜，根据不同树种，采取多种多样的形式，以适应育苗大跃进形势的需要。以一个社为单位建立苗圃，是发展合作社育苗的基本形式。造林任务小的合作社，育苗缺乏经验的地方，或是群众有买苗卖苗习惯的地区，可根据情况，采取一社育苗几社包销或几个社联社育苗的方式。合作社育苗除了可以选用地势平坦、土质较好的地方开辟小型苗圃，实行集约经营外，各地还可因地制宜采取其他方法。山西夏县创造了利用房前房后的空闲地和花盆、花池等开展小畦育苗活动的经验，做到了人人动手，户户育苗，保证了苗木供应。南方地区育杉苗，北方群众育松苗、侧柏苗，选用土层深厚，土壤湿润的山坡地开辟临时苗圃（群众称为山地育苗），做到就地育苗，就地造林，能提高造林的质量。甘肃榆中、定西等地的群众修坡地成小块梯田，引山洪水灌溉、培育抗旱性强的树种，为干旱山地的绿化开辟了广阔门路。这些方法都可因地制宜的推广。
    苗木的培育可以采用有性繁殖方法（即播种育苗方法），也可采用插条、埋条、留根、分根等无性繁殖方法（主要是萌芽性强的树种如杨、柳、法国梧桐、樟树等）。有性繁殖确有其许多好处，能够生产较多、较好的苗木，我们应该积极提倡；但是在目前育苗大跃进而种子不足的情况下，也不应该完全排除无性繁殖的方法。
    目前南方除了抓紧时机，继续组织育苗播种外，还要注意加强现有苗圃的抚育管理、抗旱排涝、防治病虫害；北方各地应紧密结合造林运动，把育苗工作一起抓起来。整好圃地，组织好种子供应和技术传授，以便及时抢墒早播，争取全苗丰产。
