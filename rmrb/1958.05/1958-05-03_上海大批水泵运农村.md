Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 2nd: The water pumps rushed out of Shanghai in April are enough to irrigate more than 20 million mu of farmland. These water pumps are being transported to North China and other regions in a continuous stream.

This year, Shanghai plans to produce 25,000 water pumps for various regions, nearly ten times more than last year. Among them, 20,800 units are for agricultural irrigation and drainage, which can irrigate 150 million mu of farmland. Most of these water pumps are required to be produced in the first half of the year to catch up with the agricultural season. In order to save time, the Shanghai local electromechanical industry department has listed the production of water pumps as the top priority at present. Since March, in addition to organizing water pump factories to rush production, it has also organized a batch of petroleum machinery factories and machine tool factories to produce water pumps, and airlifted some water pump drawings and wood molds from Shenyang to Shanghai, so that foundry factories could immediately start production.

New water pump products suitable for rural use have also been successfully trial-produced one after another. The Yuejin-style water pump trial-produced by Qia Xing Water Pump Factory weighs less than 100 kilograms, but can irrigate 500 mu of farmland. The Xinsheng Machinery Factory recently successfully trial-produced an artificial rainmaking machine. This artificial rainmaking machine can be connected to an ordinary water pump with a pipe, so that the surrounding farmland can be irrigated with raindrop-like water. It is especially suitable for sandy soil, loose soil, and areas with large seepage.

    上海大批水泵运农村
    据新华社上海2日电　4月份上海赶制的水泵，可以供应两千多万亩农田作灌溉用。这些水泵正源源运往华北等地区。
    今年，上海计划为各地生产水泵二万五千台，比去年增加近十倍。其中供给农业排灌用的有二万零八百台，可以灌溉一亿五千万亩农田。这些水泵，大部分要求上半年赶制出来，以赶上农事季节。为了争取时间，上海地方机电工业部门把生产水泵列为当前的首要任务。从3月开始，除了组织水泵厂突击赶制以外，又组织一批石油机械厂和机床厂生产水泵，并从沈阳空运部分水泵的图纸资料和木模来上海，使翻砂工厂立即投入生产。
    适合农村使用的水泵新产品，也陆续试制成功。洽兴抽水机制造厂试制的跃进式水泵，重量不到一百公斤，却能灌溉五百亩农田。新生机器厂在最近试制成功了人工造雨机。这种人工造雨机用管子接在普通的抽水机上，就能使周围农田得到雨点般的灌溉。它特别适用于沙土、地质松、渗漏大的地区。
