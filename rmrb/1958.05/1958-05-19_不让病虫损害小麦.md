　　Don't Let Pests and Diseases Damage Wheat
　　By Zeng Zhaohui

Wheat fields in some areas are suffering from severe pest and disease damage. Wheat stem rust has occurred successively in areas such as the Suzhou and Nantong regions of Jiangsu Province, and its development in Anhui Province has also been rapid. In early May, the entire province, from south to north, experienced scattered and widespread occurrences, especially in southern Anhui, with the possibility of gradually spreading northwards.

Wheat scab has occurred universally in the areas along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu and Anhui, with half of the wheat ears in some counties in southern Jiangsu already affected. According to observations at the Wangting Experimental Station, the wheat heading stage is generally four days earlier than in previous years, the onset of the disease is ten days earlier, and the peak period of the disease may also appear earlier around May 20th. This situation should attract the attention of wheat-producing areas in the Yangtze River basin.

Armyworms have begun to occur in various places. According to inspections in Xinyi County, Jiangsu Province, there are generally 120 armyworms per square meter, a density twice as high as last year. Armyworms in the third instar account for 57%, and those in the fourth and fifth instars account for 20%. The Shouxihu Farm in Anhui has more than 100,000 mu of wheat suffering from armyworm damage.

These three types of pests and diseases are all devastating. If prevention and control are not promptly implemented, significant losses will result.

Large-scale control of stem rust and scab is still a new endeavor. To ensure the success of this work, attention should be paid to the following aspects: First, fully prepare the supply of pesticides and equipment and master the techniques of their use. Whether using lime-sulfur mixture to control stem rust or Ceresan or hydrated lime powder to control scab, ensure thorough mixing and even spraying. Second, seize favorable opportunities and strike accurately and ruthlessly. Especially this year, when the supply of pesticides is insufficient, be sure to use the pesticides wisely. Control agents should be concentrated on susceptible and late-maturing varieties and on low-lying, damp wheat fields with vigorous growth and severe disease. For example, improved varieties such as "Nanda 2419," "Yupí," and "Maliying No. 3" are susceptible to scab and should be sprayed for prevention and control; local varieties and early-maturing varieties have less disease and may not need spraying. The greatest losses from stem rust and scab occur during the period from wheat flowering to the milky stage, which is also the most susceptible period, so seize this opportunity to spray for prevention and control. While controlling diseases, strengthen cultivation management, drain water from the fields, ensure healthy plant growth, and enhance disease resistance.

To eliminate armyworms, either chemical control or manual capture can be adopted. In areas where pesticides are insufficient, organize manpower to capture them, promptly eliminating them to prevent their spread.

Currently, the wheat pest and disease control efforts in Jiangsu and Anhui provinces have achieved preliminary results through mass campaigns. The Nantong region of Jiangsu Province organized 700,000 people to fight against diseases, pests, and waterlogging. Nantong County controlled 180,000 mu of stem rust and scab in two days. Taicang County in this province organized more than 2,800 combat teams and more than 15,000 sprayers to control more than 500,000 mu of wheat. Their determination is: "Do not allow diseases to spread, do not allow pests to rise, continue to fight, and completely eliminate them."

The elimination of wheat pests and diseases has reached a critical juncture. The success or failure of this battle will have a significant impact on this year's wheat harvest. We should seize the opportunity to carry out a mass movement to inspect and control pests and diseases, ensuring that the well-grown wheat is harvested.

　　不让病虫损害小麦
　　曾昭慧
    部分地区麦田正遭受着病虫的严重为害。小麦秆锈病除了已在江苏省的苏州专区、南通专区等地陆续发生外，安徽省发展也很快，5月初旬，全省从南到北均有点、面发生，尤以皖南为重，并有逐渐向北蔓延的可能。
    麦类赤霉病在江苏、安徽沿江地区已普遍发生，苏南部分县麦穗已有半数被害。根据望亭试验站观察，由于小麦抽穗期一般比往年早四天以上，病害发生提早十天，病害盛发期也可能提前在5月20日前后出现。这一情况应引起长江流域产麦地区的注意。
    粘虫在各地已开始发生，根据江苏省新沂县检查，每平方公尺一般有一百二十头，密度比去年高两倍，虫龄达三龄的占57％，四、五龄的占20％。安徽寿西湖农场已有十余万亩小麦遭受粘虫为害。
    这三种病虫，都是具有毁灭性的，如不抓紧防治，将会造成重大损失。
    在大面积上防治秆锈病和赤霉病，还是一件新事情。为了保证作好这一工作，要注意以下几个方面：首先是充分做好药械供应和掌握使用技术。不论用石灰硫磺合剂防治秆锈病或用赛力散、消石灰粉防治赤霉病，都要做到充分混和均匀，喷布细致、均匀。其次是抓住有利时机，打得准、打得狠。特别在今年药剂供应不足的情况下，一定要把药剂用在“刀口”上。防治药剂应集中使用到容易感病、晚熟的品种上和低洼潮湿、生长旺盛发病较重的麦田。例如“南大2419”、“玉皮”、“马丽英3号”等改良品种容易感染赤霉病，应当喷药防治；地方品种和早熟种发病轻，就可以不喷药。在小麦开花后到糊熟初期这个阶段，遭受秆锈病和赤霉病的损失最大，也是最易感病的时期，所以应抓住这个时机喷药防治。在防治病害的同时，还要加强栽培管理，排除田中积水，保证植株健壮生长，增强抗病力。
    扑灭粘虫，采取药剂防治和人工捕打的办法都可以。在药剂不足的地方，应组织人力捕捉，做到及时歼灭，不使扩大蔓延。
    目前江苏、安徽两省的小麦病害经过群众大力突击防治，已取得初步战果。江苏省南通专区组织了七十万人向病、虫、雨涝作斗争，南通县在两天中便防治了十八万亩秆锈病和赤霉病。这个省的太仓县组织了两千八百多个战斗队和一万五千多架喷雾器，防治了五十多万亩小麦。他们的决心是：“不让病害蔓延，不让虫害抬头，连续战斗，彻底消灭”。
    消灭小麦病虫害已经到了最紧要的关头，这一仗打得好与坏，对今年小麦丰收的影响很大。我们应该抓紧时机，开展群众性的查病虫、防治病虫运动，保证把长得好的麦子收到手里。
