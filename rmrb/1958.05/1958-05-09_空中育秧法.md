    Elevated Rice Seedling Cultivation Method

    Hongguang Agricultural Cooperative in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, has recently successfully created a new late rice seedling cultivation method: the elevated rice seedling cultivation method. By using this method, Hongguang Cooperative can cultivate strong seedlings without needing late rice seedling fields, freeing up more than 300 mu of late rice seedling fields for transplanting middle rice, and is expected to increase rice production by 100,000 jin.

    The elevated rice seedling cultivation method is simple: use four wooden sticks to build a frame, placing a bamboo sieve (a sieve woven from bamboo strips) every two chi high. Cover the bamboo sieve with a layer of rice straw, and spread a 5-fen thick layer of cow dung on the straw (to prevent water leakage). On top of the cow dung, spread a 5-fen thick layer of fine soil, and then a 2-cun thick layer of cultivation soil (composed of 60% fine soil mixed with 40% dry pig manure, horse manure, and chicken droppings). The seeds are sown on the cultivation soil, then covered tightly with fine soil and watered three times a day. To ensure the seedlings grow strong, during the growth period, if the seedlings show signs of excessive growth, reduce watering; if they show signs of yellowing, increase watering and apply some fast-acting fertilizer. If the sun is scorching and the temperature exceeds 40 degrees Celsius, build a shade to protect the normal growth of the seedlings.

    To reduce the trouble of building frames, Hongguang Cooperative has recently made improvements. Taking advantage of the many ditches in the western Sichuan Plain, they have changed the bamboo sieves, originally placed layer by layer on the frames, to be placed on the ditches. This creates flowing water in the ditches and seedling cultivation above the ditches. The seedlings cultivated are the same as those cultivated using the elevated seedling cultivation method.

    空中育秧法
    四川省郫县红光农业社，最近创造成功一种新的晚稻育秧法：空中育秧法。红光社采用这种办法育秧，不需要晚稻秧田就能培育出茁壮的秧苗，可以腾出三百多亩晚稻秧田栽插中稻，预计能增产稻谷十万斤。
    空中育秧法做起来很简单：用四根木棍搭起架子，每隔两尺高放上一个竹笆（用竹篾编成的笆子），竹笆上面铺一层稻草，草上糊五分厚的牛粪（防止漏水），牛粪上铺五分细的厚土，土上再铺二寸厚的培养土（60％的细土与40％的干猪粪、马粪、鸡屎拌搅而成），谷种就播在培养土上，然后用细土盖严，每天洒三次水。为了使秧苗长得茁壮，在生长期中，如秧苗有徒长现象，就要少洒水；如有枯黄现象，就要多洒水和加施一些速效肥料；如遇上太阳炽烈，温度超过摄氏四十度，就要搭个阴棚，保护秧苗正常生长。
    为了减少搭架子的麻烦，最近红光社又有了改进。他们利用川西平原沟渠多的特点，将原来层层放在架子上的竹笆，改放在沟渠上。这样形成沟内流水，沟上育秧。培育出的秧苗与空中育秧法培育的一样。
