Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd Dispatch from New York: Soviet Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Sobolev, held a press conference on May 2nd after the conclusion of the United Nations Security Council meeting.

He said: The Security Council concluded its discussion of the issue raised by the Soviet government "On Taking Urgent Measures to Stop U.S. Military Aircraft Carrying Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs from Flying Towards the Soviet Border" without adopting any resolution. As a result, due to the Security Council's inaction, the threat of a sudden outbreak of atomic war continues to exist, because the U.S. representative clearly hinted that the United States does not intend to stop its aircraft from continuing to conduct provocative flights.

Sobolev said: The Security Council's discussion clearly showed that the responsibility for creating world tension and the threat of war should be borne by those who are putting the world on the brink of war, those who are unwilling to abandon provocative flights near the Soviet border.

He then pointed out: Whether mankind can eliminate worries about tomorrow depends entirely on the U.S. government. It is necessary to stop the adventurous playing with atomic weapons.

Sobolev finally expressed his belief that the Security Council's discussion of the issue raised by the Soviet government will not only make the people of all countries aware of the serious danger of the provocative flights of U.S. bombers, but will also prompt the people of all countries to heighten their vigilance and strengthen the struggle to stop provocations and safeguard peace.

Xinhua News Agency, May 3rd Dispatch from New York: Soviet representative Sobolev vetoed the U.S. proposal for so-called "establishment of international inspection in the Arctic region to prevent sudden attacks" at the United Nations Security Council meeting on the 2nd.

The Security Council continued its discussion that day of the Soviet proposal "On Taking Urgent Measures to Stop U.S. Military Aircraft Carrying Atomic and Hydrogen Bombs from Flying Towards the Soviet Border." Sobolev spoke at the meeting, further exposing the essence of the U.S. proposal.

Sobolev said that the U.S. proposal only includes the vast territory of the Soviet Union in the inspection zone, while excluding one inch of U.S. territory and any U.S. bases on foreign territories. This naturally leads to the conclusion that the United States only needs intelligence information about Soviet territory. This is also proven by the fact that the U.S. government previously proposed suggestions regarding aerial inspection of areas of the same size in eastern Soviet Union and western U.S. and in appropriate areas of Europe, but the U.S. did not positively respond to this suggestion. At the same time, the U.S. proposal also separates the suggestion about inspection from any practical measures for disarmament, which is the notorious old argument of supervision without disarmament that has long been bankrupt. The main purpose of the U.S. proposal is to shirk the responsibility that the U.S. should bear for the tension caused by the provocative actions of the U.S. Air Force.

Sobolev said that the Soviet Union has long expressed and insisted on the position that it is only prepared to participate in a disarmament committee with at least half of its members being socialist countries and countries not joining major power military blocs. The current U.S. proposal advocates establishing a group consisting of the Soviet Union and six North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries to discuss the issue of conducting inspections in the Arctic. This is not a serious and constructive negotiating attitude. If the United States truly hopes to seriously discuss the issue of preventing sudden attacks (of course, not limited to the Arctic region), then this path is open. That is to convene a high-level meeting with the participation of heads of government of various countries as soon as possible. Include the above issues in the agenda of the meeting.

The Security Council also voted that day on the Soviet proposal to hold a supreme-level meeting with the participation of heads of government in the shortest possible time and to demand the cessation of flights of U.S. aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs towards the Soviet border. Due to the manipulation of Western countries, this proposal was not adopted.

    索波列夫就美机挑衅问题发表谈话
    美国应对原子战争威胁负责
    苏联在安理会否决所谓建立北极视察区的提案
    新华社3日讯　据塔斯社纽约3日讯：苏联驻联合国常任代表索波列夫5月2日在联合国安全理事会会议结束以后，举行了记者招待会。
    他说：安理会没有通过任何决定就停止了对于苏联政府提出的“关于采取紧急措施来制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机向苏联边境飞行”的问题的讨论。这样一来，由于安理会的不起作用，突然爆发原子战争的威胁仍然继续存在，因为美国代表明显地暗示，美国不打算停止它的飞机继续进行挑衅性的飞行。
    索波列夫说：安全理事会的讨论十分清楚地表明，造成世界紧张局势和战争威胁的责任应当由那些把世界放在战争边缘的人，那些不愿放弃在苏联边境附近进行挑衅性飞行的人来负。
    他接着指出：人类是否能消除对明天的耽忧，这完全取决于美国政府。必须停止那种冒险地玩弄原子武器的做法。
    索波列夫最后表示相信，安全理事会讨论苏联政府所提出的问题不仅能使各国人民认识到美国轰炸机的挑衅性飞行的严重危险性，并且将促使各国人民提高警惕，加强争取停止挑衅和维护和平的斗争。
    据新华社3日讯　纽约消息：苏联代表索波列夫2日在联合国安全理事会会议上否决了美国提出的所谓“在北极地区建立国际视察以防止突然袭击”的提案。
    安全理事会这一天继续讨论苏联提出的“关于采取紧急措施来制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机向苏联边境飞行”的问题。索波列夫在会上发了言，进一步揭露了美国提案的实质。
    索波列夫说，美国提案只把苏联广阔的领土列入视察区，而不把美国本土一寸领土和美国在外国领土上的任何一个基地列入视察区。这就使人们自然得出这样一个结论：美国只不过需要关于苏联领土的情报资料罢了。苏联政府过去曾经提出关于在苏联东部和美国西部同样大的一块地区和在欧洲的适当地区进行空中视察的建议，当时美国没有肯定地答复这项建议，这也证明了这一点。同时，美国提案还把关于视察的建议同裁军的任何实际措施割裂开来，这是早就破产了的不裁军而实行监督的臭名远扬的老主张。美国提案的主要目的是推卸美国对美国空军的挑衅行为造成的紧张局势应负的责任。
    索波列夫说，苏联早就表示并且坚持这样的立场：它只准备参加至少有一半成员是社会主义国家和不加入大国军事集团的国家的裁军委员会。现在的美国提案主张成立一个有苏联和六个北大西洋公约组织国家参加的小组来讨论在北极进行视察的问题。这不是认真和建设性的谈判态度。如果美国真正希望认真讨论防止突然袭击（当然不仅仅限于北极地区）的措施问题，那么这条道路是畅通的。这就是尽速召开有各国政府首脑参加的高级会议。在会议的议程中列入上述问题。
    安全理事会这一天还表决了苏联提出的主张在最短期内举行有政府首脑参加的最高级会议和要求制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国飞机向苏联边境飞行的提案。由于西方国家的操纵，这项提案没有被通过。
