Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Health Experiment
Using Pumpkin Seeds to Prevent Schistosomiasis

This newspaper reports that eating raw pumpkin seeds can prevent schistosomiasis. This is an important discovery made by scientific researchers at the Zhejiang Provincial Institute of Health during their research on the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis.

In experiments conducted at the end of last year, it was discovered that pumpkin seeds have the effect of causing schistosomiasis worms in animals to migrate to the liver. Therefore, researchers at the institute began a key experiment on the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis by oral administration of pumpkin seeds at the end of February. For the prevention experiment, 340 white mice with the same physique, each infected with 40 schistosomiasis cercariae, were selected and divided into five major groups. In addition to the control group, the other four major groups were further divided into four subgroups, and the mice were fed raw pumpkin seed flesh for seven to twenty-eight days, with each mouse eating three grams per day. The first major group and the control group of mice were dissected and observed 36 days after infection with schistosomiasis. The results showed that in the first subgroup, which ate pumpkin seeds for 28 consecutive days, the worm reduction rate reached 77%; the worm-free rate reached 64.71%; and the female worm-free rate reached 76.47%. The second subgroup, which ate pumpkin seeds for 21 consecutive days, also had a worm-free rate of 38.89%. In the other two subgroups, which ate pumpkin seed flesh for seven to fourteen days, it was also found that the number of adult worms decreased, and these worms had undergone morphological changes. In contrast, the adult worm rate in the control group of mice that did not eat pumpkin seed flesh was 52%. This experiment proved that the more days pumpkin seed flesh is eaten, the fewer adult worms there are, and it definitely has the effect of killing schistosomiasis larvae in animals. According to preliminary observations in the treatment section, eating pumpkin seed flesh can shrink the adult worm body, degenerate the reproductive organs of female worms, and reduce or eliminate eggs in the uterus; at the same time, it can prolong the life of diseased mice.

Currently, the institute is further studying and analyzing the pharmacological effects of pumpkin seed flesh in killing schistosomiasis and how to apply it to the prevention and treatment of schistosomiasis in humans. (Zheng Feng)

    浙江省卫生实验院试验
　　用南瓜子预防血吸虫病
    本报讯　吃生南瓜子可以预防血吸虫病。这是浙江省卫生实验院科学研究人员进行血吸虫病防治研究工作中的重要发现。
    在去年年底试验过程中，发现南瓜子有使动物体内血吸虫虫体向肝脏移行的作用。于是该院研究人员于2月底开始进行口服南瓜子预防与治疗的重点实验。预防实验部分首先选择体质相同，每只都感染有血吸虫尾蚴四十条的小白鼠三百四十只，然后分为五个大组。除了对照组以外，其余四个大组又各分为四个小组分别给小白鼠吃生南瓜子肉七到二十八天，每天每鼠吃三克。第一大组及对照组小白鼠均在感染血吸虫病三十六天后解剖观察证明：连吃南瓜子二十八天的第一小组小白鼠中，虫体减少率达77％；无虫率达64.71％：无雌虫率达76.47％。连吃二十一天南瓜子的第二小组小白鼠，无虫率也有38.89％。其他两小组吃南瓜子肉率七天到十四天，也发现成虫的数目减少，而且这些虫体都已起了形态的变化。而未吃南瓜子肉的对照组的小白鼠，成虫率达52％。这次实验证明，吃南瓜子肉天数越多，成虫越少，确有杀灭动物体内血吸虫幼虫的作用。据治疗部分初步观察，吃南瓜子肉可使成虫虫体缩小，雌虫生殖器官退化，子宫内虫卵减少或消失；同时，能延长病鼠寿命。
    目前该院正进一步研究分析南瓜子肉杀灭血吸虫的药理作用和怎样把它应用到人体的防治血吸虫病工作上去。（正峰）
