Great Changes in Tillage Tools
——Introduction to the Tillage Machinery Hall of the National Agricultural Tool Exhibition
By our reporter Shao Yongli

The Tillage Machinery Hall tells people with vivid facts that a flying leap is taking place in China's tillage implements. People have just seen the "two oxen pulling a plow" plow that has been used for more than 1,500 years and many old-fashioned plows, and immediately they see all kinds of new walking plows, double-wheel double-share plows, and so on.

A total of 1,066 exhibits fill the spacious venue. They come from all over the country. At first glance, the tall and colorful power machinery is the most eye-catching, but on closer inspection, the most interesting thing is the more than 700 agricultural tools (accounting for more than 73% of all exhibits in this hall) created and improved by the masses. Visitors from the countryside stood next to the exhibits they liked, watching them repeatedly, and some even drew patterns on the spot, preparing to imitate them when they returned. They said that these agricultural tools are most suitable for the current production needs, and can be made locally using local materials.

From the more than 700 exhibited agricultural tools created and improved by the masses, it can be seen that in order to realize the "four, five, eight" increase production targets ahead of schedule, farmers in various places have brought their tremendous creativity into play based on the needs of increasing yield per unit area, their own labor experience, and the characteristics of their regions, and have improved and created agricultural tools that are most urgently needed for deep plowing, intensive cultivation, and increased fertilization. The double-layer double-share plow created by members of the Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative in Changge County, Henan Province, was praised by the visitors. This plow looks similar to an eight-inch walking plow, but it is equipped with two plowshares with different front and rear heights. The front plow tills to a depth of eight inches, and the rear plow tills another seven inches deeper in the ditch tilled by the front plow. The rear plow is small and does not turn the soil over, which can avoid the shortcomings of general plows that bring raw soil to the top during deep plowing, affecting crop growth. It is a good agricultural tool for achieving deep plowing and increasing production, and has begun to be promoted throughout Henan Province. Many of the plows, sowing tools, weeding hoes, and other agricultural tools on display have fertilizer application and topdressing devices. The topdressing and drought-resistant cart created by members of the Lianjin Agricultural Cooperative in Pingyao County, Shanxi Province, is extremely efficient. Two people pulling it can topdress five mu in one hour.

These agricultural tools created and improved by the masses show that in the great leap forward in production, the vast number of farmers in China have tried every means to improve the efficiency of agricultural tools in order to solve the difficulties of insufficient labor and animal power. Many of the exhibits here have the characteristics of multiple uses and being able to do various agricultural tasks at one time. The efficiency of the rice precision seeder in Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province is ten times faster than manual sowing. The "seven-legged automatic seeder" made of wood by farmers in Feng County, Jiangsu Province, can simultaneously perform four agricultural tasks such as sowing, fertilizing, precision sowing, and spreading medicine. The Wuxing combined seeder in Liaoning Province can not only sow various crops such as soybeans, corn, cotton, and millet, but also has attached fertilization and weeding devices, and can sow twelve mu of land every day. In order to realize the production plan of changing from single-season to double-season or from double-season to triple-season, farmers in the southern regions attach great importance to shortening the land preparation time between two seasons of crops. The more than a dozen newly improved or created rollers, combined harrows, and pu rollers exhibited here are more efficient and of better quality than the old-fashioned spike-tooth harrows for land preparation, and they themselves can turn and break the soil, eliminating the process of plowing with a plow.

It can be seen from the tillage implements exhibited in various places that the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more agricultural tool reforms there are, and the stronger the masses' daring to think and do original spirit. The agricultural tools improved and created by the masses in Henan are not only in the main position in the agricultural irrigation and drainage machinery hall, but also many of the agricultural tools exhibited in this hall. There are twelve kinds of multi-row seeders exhibited in Anhui Province, of which seven almost all parts are made of wood.

Many of the new agricultural tools exhibited in this hall have been improved by farmers in various places according to the characteristics of local production and farming experience. Therefore, they can be applied to the needs of planting various crops in this area. There are new types of animal-powered agricultural tools for land preparation, sowing, weeding, and harvesting sent from mountainous areas, plains areas, paddy field areas, dry land areas, and ridge farming areas. These were selected from the more than 4 million new agricultural tools that have been promoted throughout the country. In particular, the double-wheel double-share plow, which has been improved in various places, has been widely welcomed by farmers. There are double-wheel double-share plows sent from more than a dozen provinces, all of which have added regional characteristics while maintaining the general advantages of the double-wheel double-share plow. The double-wheel double-share plows from paddy field areas, in order to overcome the difficulties of sinking and sticky soil, some have widened wheels, some have raised plow tips, some have added boat-shaped skids under the iron wheels, some have added plow covers, some have added wooden plow bottoms, and so on. These are all modifications made by farmers in various places according to local production conditions. Among the exhibits, there are also various handmade wooden double-wheel double-share plows created by the masses based on the principle of the double-wheel double-share plow, which have the same effectiveness as the double-wheel double-share plow, but are lighter and easier to use than the iron double-share plow. The double-wheel double-share plow, which could only perform a single task originally, has been transformed by farmers into an agricultural tool for multiple tasks. On many of the double-wheel double-share plows on display, some have added soil rakes, or installed fertilizer application and sowing devices, and some have even been converted into four-purpose double-wheel double-share plows, allowing it to plow, water, sow, and fertilize at the same time. The new agricultural tools modified by the masses have become more lightweight and applicable, reducing weight and cost.

In this hall, the most novel agricultural tool is the rice transplanter, which has basically been successfully tested. According to agricultural experts, the effectiveness of this agricultural tool is not only a groundbreaking original creation in China, but also unprecedented in the world. This rice transplanter, if towed by animal power, can transplant rice in thirty mu of fields every day, transplanting six rows at a time, and the loss rate is only 10%. The transplanters made in Jiangsu, Tianjin, Anhui, Jilin and other places exhibited this time can be promoted with slight improvements. There is also an eye-catching exhibit in this hall, which is the lightest (less than half a catty) "easy-to-use dense planting frame" among all the exhibits. It was researched and created by Wang Sanming, secretary of the Xiangtan County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Hunan Province, and the masses. Although the tool is small, it solves a problem in paddy field production and can eliminate the work of specially marking rows during transplanting that has always been done.

The last part of this hall's exhibits are various types of power tillage machinery. They not only show the beautiful prospects of China's agricultural mechanization, but also a good start to China's agricultural mechanization cause. Here I can tell readers an exciting news, since the local industry blossomed all over China, in the last six months, many places have produced tractors, there are nineteen exhibits are made themselves everywhere. They use diesel or gas as fuel, the maximum of forty horsepower, the smallest one and a half horsepower. China's great leap in agriculture has received more powerful support from China's industry and the working class.

    耕作工具的伟大变化
    ——全国农具展览会耕作机具馆介绍
    本报记者　邵永力
    耕作机具馆以活生生的事实告诉人们，我国耕作农具正在发生飞跃的变化。人们刚看到沿用了一千五百多年的“二牛抬杠”犁和许多旧式犁，立刻就看到了各种各样新式步犁、双轮双铧犁等等。
    全馆一千零六十六件展品摆满了宽大的场地。它们来自全国各地，猛一看，高大的五颜六色的动力机械最显眼，但仔细看来，最令人发生兴趣的是七百多件（占这个馆全部展品73％强）群众所创造和改良的农具。来自农村的观众，站在自己看中了的展品旁边，翻来复去的观看，有些人还当场画下了图样，准备回去仿造。他们说这些农具最适合目前生产需要，而且又能就地取材，就地制造。
    从群众创造和改良的七百多件展出农具中，可以看到各地农民为提前实现“四、五、八”的增产指标，根据提高单位面积产量的需要，自己的劳动经验，本地区的特点，发挥了巨大的创造性，改良和创造了目前最迫切需用的适应深耕细作、增施肥料等作业的农具。河南长葛县先进第一农业社社员创造的双层双铧犁，受到参观者的同声称赞。这种犁样子和八吋步犁相仿，但它安装着前后高低位置不同的两个犁铧，前犁耕深达八寸，后犁又在前铧耕过的沟里再深耕七寸，后犁小不翻土，可以避免一般犁深耕时把生土翻到上面影响作物生长的缺点，是实现深耕增产的好农具，已开始在河南全省推广。在展出的许多耕犁、播种农具、耘锄等农具上，都有施肥和追肥装置。山西省平遥县联进农业社社员创造的追肥抗旱车，效率极高，用两个人拉一小时就可以追肥五亩。
    这些群众创造和改良的农具表明，我国广大农民在生产大跃进中，为了解决劳力和畜力不足的困难，千方百计地设法提高农具的效率。这里的许多展品都有用途多、一次能做多样农活的特点。广东省中山县水稻点播机的效率比人工用手播快十倍。江苏省丰县农民用木料做的“七腿自动耩子”，能同时作下种、施肥、点种和撒药等四种农活。辽宁省五行联合播种机，不仅能点播大豆、玉米、棉花、谷子等多种作物，还有附设的施肥、除草装置，每天能播种十二亩地。南方地区的农民为实现改单季为双季或改双季为三季的生产规划，对缩短两季作物中间的整地时间是非常重视的，这里展出的十几种新改良或创造的滚耙，联作耙、蒲滚都比旧式钉齿耙整地效率高、质量好，而且本身能够翻土和碎土，免去了用犁翻地的工序。
    从展出的各地耕作农具中可以看出，那里的群众干劲越大，那里的农具改革的越多，群众的敢想敢干的独创精神也越强。河南群众改良和创造的农具，除在农田灌溉排水机具馆占主要位置外，在这个馆里展出的农具也很多。安徽省展出的多行播种机就有十二种，其中有七种几乎全部机件都是木制的。
    在这个馆里展出的许多新式农具，都是经过各地农民根据当地生产的特点和耕作经验加以改进的。因此，能够适用于本地区种植各样农作物的需要。这里有从山区、平原地区、水田地区、旱田地区和垅作地区送来展出的整地、播种、除草、收割等改装的新式畜力农具。这是从全国各地已推广的四百多万部新农具里选出来的。特别是经过各地改进的双轮双铧犁，受到农民的普遍欢迎。这里有从十多个省送来的双轮双铧犁，都在保持双轮双铧犁通用优点的条件下，增加了地区性的特色。来自水田地区的双轮双铧犁，为了克服下陷、粘土的困难，有的轮子加宽了，有的犁鼻加高了，有的在铁轮下面增加了船型拖板，有的加上了铧套，有的增加了木犁底等等，这都是各地农民根据当地的生产条件改装的。展品中还有群众根据双轮双铧犁的原理，创造了多种手工木制的双轮双铧犁，其效能和双轮双铧犁一样，但是比铁制的双铧犁轻便好用。原来只能单项作业的双轮双铧犁，已经被农民改造成多项作业的农具。在展出的许多双轮双铧犁上，有的加了耙土器，或者装上了施肥、播种装置，有的还改成四用双轮双铧犁，使它同时能耕地、浇水、下种、施肥。经过群众改装的新式农具，都变得更加轻便、适用，减少了重量，降低了成本。
    在这个馆里，最新奇的农具是基本上已经试验成功的水稻插秧机。据农业专家们说：这种农具的效能，不仅在我国是破天荒的独创，在世界上也是空前的。这种水稻插秧机，如用畜力拖带，每天可以插三十亩田水稻，每次插秧六行，费损率仅占10％。这次展出的江苏、天津、安徽、吉林等地造的插秧机，它们稍加改进就可以推广。在这个馆里还有一个引人注意的展品，是全部展品实物中最轻的（不足半斤重）“随手密植插秧架”，它是中共湖南省湘潭县县委书记王三明和群众一起研究创造出来的，工具虽小却解决了水田生产上的一个问题，可以免去历来插秧时专门进行划行的工作。
    这个馆的最后一部分展品，是各式各样的动力耕作机械。它们不仅显示了我国农业机械化的美丽前景，也是我国农业机械化事业良好的开端。这里可以告诉读者一条振奋人心的消息，自从我国地方工业遍地开花以来，在最近半年中，许多地方都生产了拖拉机，展览品中有十九台是各地自己制造的。它们有用柴油做燃料的，也有用煤气做动力的，最大的四十马力，最小的有一点五马力。我国农业的大跃进，已经得到我国工业和工人阶级更加有力的支援。
