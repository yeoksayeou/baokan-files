　　At three o'clock in the afternoon on April 30th, commune members of the Tangxia Agricultural Commune in the suburbs of Guangzhou, excitedly brought the old and the young to gather at the Nankou village entrance, waiting to meet Chairman Mao. At this moment, people seemed more affectionate than usual, with welcoming smiles everywhere.

　　Chairman Mao is here!

　　At three forty-five, someone in the crowd shouted: "Chairman Mao is here, he's here!" Looking westward, on the tree-lined highway, three cars were speeding this way from Guangzhou.

　　The cars appeared at the village entrance of the Tangxia Commune.

　　Chairman Mao, wearing a pair of shallow black cloth shoes, walked slowly towards the crowd with a smile. Tao Zhu, First Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and Zhu Guang, Mayor of Guangzhou, were about to introduce the commune cadres to Chairman Mao, but hundreds of overjoyed peasant brothers and sisters immediately crowded around. They applauded, cheered, and smiled, surrounding Chairman Mao even more tightly. Chairman Mao looked around at the crowd with a smile, frequently raising his hand in acknowledgement.

　　The village cadres persuaded the farmers to make way for a small path. Chairman Mao walked along the street towards the village. On both sides of the neat stone-paved street were dense crowds of farmers. Chairman Mao was radiant and full of energy, constantly nodding and greeting the crowds on both sides.

　　Six Levels of Cadres Together

　　After entering the village, commune director Zhong Xuben led Chairman Mao into the agricultural commune office.

　　The rectangular table in the room was surrounded by people. Sitting next to Chairman Mao were Liang Fu, the Party branch secretary of the commune, and Zhong Xuben, the commune director. Chairman Mao asked the names and ages of the agricultural commune cadres one by one, and carefully inquired about the situation of early rice, sideline occupations, and the lives of the farmers this year.

　　"Is your production this year alright?"

　　"This year is much better than last year," Zhong Xuben replied to Chairman Mao's inquiry.

　　"How many pigs are raised in the commune?"

　　"More than three thousand eight hundred."

　　"How many are raised by the commune members themselves?"

　　"More than three hundred."

　　Chairman Mao nodded and said: "That's good, I approve. Cooperatives should raise more." At this time, Comrade Tao Zhu interjected: "You are able to see Chairman Mao today, so this year's production must be even better!"

　　Chairman Mao smiled and asked: "Will your cooperative disband?" Branch Secretary Liang Fu replied crisply: "It won't disband, it's an ironclad state!"

　　"It won't disband? Why?"

　　"First, our commune's income has increased, which is better than individual farming," commune director Zhong Xuben replied. "Before joining the commune, according to the level of upper-middle peasants, the average net income per person per year, calculated by size of household, was 107 yuan and 40 fen."

　　"And now?" Chairman Mao asked.

　　"Last year, our average net income per person was 164 yuan."

　　Chairman Mao nodded, satisfied, and slowly said: "Ah, from one hundred and seven, increased to one hundred and sixty-four!" Comrade Tao Zhu asked with a smile again: "Is there a second reason?" At this time, Zhong Xuben raised his voice and said: "There is the correct leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao..." Before he finished speaking, the people present burst into laughter. The atmosphere in the room suddenly became lively. Chairman Mao also looked at everyone with smiling eyes.

　　Next, Chairman Mao inquired about the commune's public accumulation and the situation of Party and Youth League members, to which the commune cadres answered one by one. Chairman Mao encouraged everyone to discuss matters more with the masses and to improve production. After asking the commune cadres, Chairman Mao pointed to the secretary of the Guangzhou Suburban District Party Committee and the secretary of the township-level Party committee sitting there, and asked Comrade Zhu Guang: "Who are these comrades?" Comrade Zhu Guang introduced them one by one. Comrade Tao Zhu joked: "Now there are four levels of cadres together." Chairman Mao turned to Comrade Tao Zhu and said: "Including you, me, we are six levels of cadres together." Everyone laughed along.

　　More and more people gathered in front of the commune office door waiting to meet Chairman Mao, and cheers rose and fell. As soon as Chairman Mao came out of the door, dozens and hundreds of hands, filled with infinite affection, reached out to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao shook hands with everyone one by one. While shaking hands, Chairman Mao always smiled, nodded, and thanked them for their trust and love for the Communist Party. An old grandfather named Zhong Yindi, who was eighty years old, had heard that Chairman Mao was coming today, and ran early to the door to wait for a long time. He waited. Chairman Mao discovered him in the happy crowd. The Chairman reached out his hand to him. He was so happy that he froze, mistaking his left hand for the one to give the chairman. Realizing his mistake, he raised his right hand high to greet Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao smiled and returned the greeting.

　　Chairman Mao excitedly shook hands and greeted the crowd while walking towards the cadres' experimental field in the northwest of the village.

　　Visiting the Experimental Field

　　Not far from the banyan tree at the end of the village was a green expanse of rice paddies. Chairman Mao stood by the field, carefully observed it, and said: "This rice is growing well!" Comrade Tao Zhu asked the commune cadres casually: "How much can you harvest in one crop?" "About seven hundred catties!" Then, Chairman Mao asked the commune cadre beside him: "Will it lodge? Is the harvest guaranteed?" The commune cadre replied to Chairman Mao: "As long as we do a good job of drainage and irrigation, it won't lodge!"

　　Chairman Mao walked along the ridge.

　　In Guangzhou in April of the Gregorian calendar, the sun is as hot as fire. Pan Zhan, the secretary of the grassroots Party committee, handed Chairman Mao a bamboo sun hat. Chairman Mao looked at it briefly, put it on gently, and said, "I look like a farmer now." Chairman Mao discovered a strange vegetable field. People standing next to Chairman Mao pointed to the crops in the melon field and introduced: This is agastache, this is cucumber, that is cowpea, ginger, and four kinds of crops are planted in one field at the same time! Chairman Mao expressed his satisfaction after hearing this. He said: "In this way, the land utilization rate is very high." Further ahead, Chairman Mao came to the cadres' experimental field. At this time, peasant woman Huang Sannu came rushing from the village, panting, parted the crowd, ran behind Chairman Mao, held up a cloth umbrella, and carefully shielded Chairman Mao from the scorching sun. The rice in the experimental field was growing particularly well. When Chairman Mao heard Zhong Liming, the deputy director of the commune, introduce that the cadres' experimental field plans to harvest 1,600 catties in one crop and 3,200 catties in two crops, he asked happily: "Can you harvest so much in one crop?"

　　Meeting with Students Participating in Work-Study Programs

　　Chairman Mao looked up and saw that the ridges of the small canal on the north side were already filled with twenty or thirty Young Pioneers. Dozens of bright eyes were intently staring at Chairman Mao's kind face, but they were too shy to get too close to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao smiled and greeted them. An older student named Ren Puhua bravely jumped over from the canal and held Chairman Mao's hand tightly with both hands. Chairman Mao asked: "Where are you from, what are you doing here?" Ren Puhua calmly answered one by one. Chairman Mao knew that they were students from Guangzhou No. 30 Middle School, and they came to Tangxia Commune to participate in work-study labor. Chairman Mao was very happy and asked: "Are you working well? How many work points can you earn every day?" Ren Puhua answered Chairman Mao in Mandarin. Chairman Mao nodded with satisfaction after listening and said: "You all understand a little, you can talk about some things." Chairman Mao pointed to these Young Pioneers participating in work-study programs and asked the commune cadres beside him: "Do you welcome them?" Everyone laughed when they heard this. The commune cadre replied to Chairman Mao: "The commune's labor force is not enough, and we have signed a contract with each other." As soon as Chairman Mao turned around to walk back to the village, crisp, loud, and rhythmic cheers rang out in the children's team. Chairman Mao heard it, turned around, and waved to them with a smile. Hello, elders!

　　The sun was setting, and Chairman Mao passed through the village along the old road, preparing to leave. The crowds from all directions also moved along. Wherever Chairman Mao went, cheers and applause rang out. Chairman Mao walked in the crowd that lined the streets to see him off. He was particularly concerned about the elderly farmers, shaking hands and greeting them one by one. These old farmers, who had suffered so much in the past, often had trembling lips when Chairman Mao shook hands and greeted them, but they were too excited to say a word. Old poor peasant Zhong Yongcheng, who was seventy years old, had suffered endless torment in the old society. Once, when he went to the mountains to chop wood, he had to use sour plums and sour plum pits to satisfy his hunger. On this day, when Chairman Mao shook hands with him, his eyes glistened with tears, and he bowed to Chairman Mao again and again. Old Granny Huang also supported herself with a cane to rush to the foot of the banyan tree on this day. Chairman Mao walked up to her and shook her hand. Mothers and children, at this happy moment, almost all tried their best to express their love and respect for the leader by shaking hands. Chairman Mao also shook every hand extended by the farmers.

　　Farewell to our Beloved Leader

　　At four forty-five, Chairman Mao said goodbye to the happy Tangxia Commune! The cheers accompanied Chairman Mao's car away from the village entrance.

　　That dusk until night, the entire Tangxia Commune was immersed in a happy atmosphere. The elderly, youth, women, and children, in the streets, in their homes, and under the trees, in clusters and groups, discussed, recalled, and spread the word about this happy meeting with great excitement. A thirteen-year-old Young Pioneer, Wen Kefeng, wrote down this happiest day in Tangxia Commune with her feelings about meeting Chairman Mao in her diary that day. She wrote: "...From the second car walked down our beloved leader Chairman Mao, whom we missed day and night. We were cheering loudly, jumping. Our hearts were beating fiercely. As soon as Chairman Mao got out of the car, he looked at us kindly and smiled. I didn't dare to reach out to shake hands with him, I just shouted Long live Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao waved and smiled to the farmers and students on both sides as he walked. Later, Chairman Mao went to the agricultural commune office to visit, and we waited at the door. After Chairman Mao came out, he walked towards the field, and we were very eager to see him again. So we followed him, but someone blocked me. We had to wait by the side of the road. After Chairman Mao visited the experimental field, he came back. The commune cadres told me not to shake hands with the leader because he was very tired. However, when Chairman Mao walked up to me, I shouted Long live Chairman Mao. He smiled and stretched out his strong hand in front of me to shake hands with me. In this tense moment, I thought it would be very impolite if I didn't shake hands at this time. I quickly stretched out both hands, tightly holding Chairman Mao's hand, and shouted: Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! My eyes were filled with tears. Later, Chairman Mao was leaving, and we kept sending him to the car, and he waved goodbye to us again.

　　When I came back, my heart kept beating, and my heart could never calm down. After I came back, the classmates all held my hand tightly.

　　Today, I was too moved. I think this is the greatest honor in my life. At night, I was immersed in happiness all night."

　　毛主席在棠下社
　　本报记者　许实　杜导正

    4月30日下午三点钟，广州郊区棠下农业社的社员们，兴冲冲地扶老携幼，齐集到村边南口，等待着同毛主席会见。这时候，人们好像要比平日分外亲热，到处都是迎人的笑脸。
    毛主席来了！
    三时四十五分，人群里有人嚷道：“毛主席来了，来了！”往西一望，在绿树成荫的公路上，三辆小汽车自广州的方向正向这边疾驶而来。
    汽车出现在棠下社的村口。
    毛主席穿着一双浅口黑布鞋，笑眯眯地缓步走到群众的面前。中共广东省委第一书记陶铸同志和广州市长朱光同志，正要把社干部介绍给毛主席认识，可是欣喜若狂的几百个农民兄弟却一下子围拢上来了。他们鼓着掌，欢呼着，笑着，将毛主席围得更紧了。毛主席含笑环视人群，频频举手答礼。
    还是村干部说服了农民让出一条小路。毛主席沿着街道向村里走去。整洁的石砌的街道两旁，也是密密麻麻的农民群众。毛主席容光焕发，神彩奕奕，不断地向两旁的群众点头致意。
    六级干部在一起
    走进村庄以后，社主任锺叙本把毛主席引进了农业社办公室。
    室内长方形的桌子周围坐满了人。同毛主席并排坐着的是社的党支部书记梁富、社主任锺叙本。毛主席逐一询问了这个农业社干部的名字、年纪，又仔细地询问了今年早稻、副业和农民生活的情形。
    “你们今年的生产还可以吧？”
    “今年比去年好得多了。”锺叙本回答了毛主席的询问。
    “社里养了多少头猪？”
    “三千八百多头。”
    “社员自养的多少？”
    “三百多头。”
    毛主席听了点头说：“那样好，我赞成，合作社应该多养些。”这时，陶铸同志插话说：“你们今天能够见到毛主席，今年生产要搞的更好啊！”
    毛主席又微笑着问：“你们合作社会散伙吗？”支部书记梁富利利落落地答道：“散不了，铁桶江山！”
    “散不了？为什么？”
    “第一，我们社的收入增加，比单干户好。”社主任锺叙本答道，“入社前，按照上中农水平，大小人口平均计算每人一年纯收入一百零七元四角。”
    “现在呢？”主席问。
    “去年我们每人平均纯收入一百六十四元。”
    毛主席点着头，满意地、慢慢地说道：“啊，从一百零七，增加到一百六十四！”陶铸同志又笑着问：“还有第二呢？”这时，锺叙本提高嗓子说：“有共产党、有毛主席的正确领导……”话未说完，在座的人已经纵声大笑。全场空气顿时活跃起来。毛主席也用含笑的眼睛望着大家。
    接着，毛主席又询问了社的公共积累，党、团员情况，社干部都一一作了回答。毛主席勉励大家有事多和群众商量，把生产搞好。毛主席问过社干部，又指着在座的中共广州市郊区党委会书记、乡基层党委书记，问朱光同志说：“这几位同志是谁呀！”朱光同志一一作了介绍。陶铸同志便打趣的说道：“现在是四级干部在一起。”毛主席转面对着陶铸同志说：“连你，我，我们是六级干部在一起了。”大家跟着欢笑起来。
    在社办公室门前等候会见毛主席的人越聚越多，欢呼声此起彼伏。毛主席一出大门，几十几百只手，带着无限的情意，伸向毛主席。毛主席同大家一一握手。握手时，毛主席总是笑，点头，感谢他们对共产党的信任和爱戴。一个叫锺银地的老爷爷，八十岁了，今天听到毛主席来，早早跑到门口久等。他等着了。毛主席在欢乐的人群中发现了他。主席向他伸过手去，他欢喜得楞住了，错把左手给了主席，清醒过来后，高高举起右手，向毛主席问好。毛主席笑着给他还礼。
    毛主席兴奋地，一面同群众握手答礼，一面向着村庄西北面的干部试验田走去。
    参观试验田
    走出村尾榕树脚不远的地方，便是一片葱绿绿的稻田。毛主席站在田边，仔细地观察后说：“这禾长得不坏！”陶铸同志随口向社干部问道：“一造能打多少？”“大约可打七百斤吧！”接着，毛主席问旁边的社干部说：“会倒伏吗？收成有没有保证？”社干部回答毛主席说：“只要搞好排灌，倒伏不了的！”
    毛主席沿着田埂走去。
    阳历4月的广州，太阳像火一般毒热。基层党委书记潘湛递给毛主席一顶竹制的遮阳帽。毛主席略略端详了一下，轻轻地戴上，说道：“我也像个农民了。”毛主席发现了一块奇怪的菜地。站在毛主席旁边的人指着瓜田里的作物介绍说：这是藿香，这是黄瓜，那是豆角，生姜，一块田同时种了四种作物呢！毛主席听了表示满意。他说：“这样，土地的利用率就很高了。”再往前走，毛主席来到了干部试验田，这时，农民妇女黄三女气喘喘从村庄赶来，拨开人群，跑在毛主席的身后，将一柄布伞撑开，小心地给毛主席挡住炎热的阳光。试验田的禾稻生长得特别的好。当毛主席听到社的副主任锺礼明介绍说：干部试验田一造计划收获一千六百斤，两造三千二百斤的时候，他高兴地问道：“一造也可以收获这么多吗？”
    同勤工俭学的学生会见
    毛主席一抬头，北面小渠那边的田塍上已经站满了二三十个红领巾。几十双乌溜溜的眼睛，正在全神贯注地瞅着毛主席慈祥的面孔，但不好意思过份地挨近毛主席。毛主席笑着迎上前去。一个年长的叫任溥华的学生，勇敢地从渠那边跳过来，用两只手紧紧握着毛主席的手。毛主席问道：“你们是那里来的，来这里做什么？”任溥华从容不迫地一一回答。毛主席知道他们是广州市第三十中学的学生，到棠下社参加勤工俭学劳动来的。毛主席十分高兴，又问：“你们劳动得好吧？每天能赚多少工分？”任溥华操着普通话回答了毛主席。毛主席听了满意地点点头说：“你们都懂得一点，可以讲一些了。”毛主席指着这些勤工俭学的少先队员，问身旁的社干部说：“你们欢迎他们吗？”大家听到都笑了。社干部回答毛主席说：“社的劳动力不够，我们双方订好了合同的。”毛主席刚刚转身向村中走，在孩子们的队伍中，顿时响起了清脆、宏亮、很有节奏的欢呼声。毛主席听到了，回转身来，笑着向他们招手致意。老人们，您们好！
    太阳快西沉了，毛主席沿着旧路穿过村庄，准备离开。四面八方的人流也跟着移动了。毛主席走到那里，欢呼声和掌声就在那里响起。毛主席走在夹道欢送的群众中，他特别关心老年农民，跟他们一一握手、问好。这些过去饱经苦难岁月的老农民，每当毛主席和他们握手问好的时候，许多老农民嘴唇微微地颤动着，却激动得连一句话也说不出来。七十岁的老贫农锺永成，在旧社会里受尽了折磨。有一回他到山上砍柴的时候，不得不用酸梅和酸梅核充饥。这一天，当毛主席同他握手的时候，他眼睛里闪着泪花，连连向毛主席鞠躬。黄老大娘这一天也扶着手杖赶到榕树脚下，毛主席走到她的跟前，同她握了手。母亲们，孩子们，在这个幸福的时刻，差不多都尽情地力求用握手来表示她们对领袖的敬爱。由农民那里伸来的每一只手，毛主席也都握过了。
    送别亲爱的领袖
    四时四十五分，毛主席和欢乐的棠下社告别了！欢呼声一直伴送毛主席的汽车离开村口。
    当天黄昏直到晚间，整个棠下社都沉浸在幸福的气氛中。老年人、青年、妇女、孩子，在街心上，在家庭里，在树脚下，一簇簇一群群地兴高彩烈地讨论、回忆着、传诵着这次幸福的会见。一个十三岁的少先队员温可风，她在当天的日记上，用她同毛主席会见的感受，写下了棠下社这个最幸福的日子。她写道：“……第二辆车里走下了我们日夜所怀念的敬爱的领袖毛主席。我们在高声欢呼，在跳跃。我们的心在激烈地跳动。毛主席一下车就慈祥地望着我们笑。我不敢伸手同他握手，只高喊毛主席万岁。毛主席一边行一边跟两旁的农民和学生招手，微笑。后来，毛主席走到农业社办公室里参观，我们就在门口等着。毛主席走出来后，就往田里走，我们很急切地想再看一看他。就跟着他走，可是有人把我挡住了。我们只得在路边等着。毛主席参观试验田后，又走回来了。社干部吩咐我说不要和领袖握手，因为他很累。可是，当毛主席走到我身边时，我大喊毛主席万岁。他笑了笑，就伸出那强壮有力的手到我面前，要和我握手。在这紧张的时刻里，我想假如这时不握就很失礼了。我赶快伸出两手，紧紧地握主席的手，口里喊着：毛主席！毛主席！我的眼里充满了泪水。后来，毛主席要走了，我们一直送他上车，他又挥手和我们告别。
    回来时，我的心不断在跳动，我的心永远也不能平静下来。回来后，同学们都紧紧地握住我的手。
    今天，我太感动了，我认为这是我一生中最大的光荣，晚上，我整夜都沉浸在幸福中”。
