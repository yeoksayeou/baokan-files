    Dulles' Inglorious Mission
    By Our Staff Commentator
    After visiting Japan and South Korea, Turkish Prime Minister Dulles arrived in Taiwan on April 28 to hold so-called "secret talks" with the Chiang Kai-shek clique. When Dulles passed through Karachi on April 19 on his way to the Far East, he stated that his visit to Japan, South Korea, and other places was to "establish closer economic ties" with these regions. However, judging from his various performances in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, this statement was merely a smokescreen, and he actually came to the Far East with an inglorious mission.

    According to American news agencies, Dulles' real purpose in visiting the Far East was to try to eliminate the differences between the Japanese, South Korean authorities, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and to persuade them to organize a so-called "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization." Sure enough, during his stay in Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, Dulles delivered a series of speeches hostile to the Chinese people and undermining peace in the Far East. In South Korea, he actively engaged in activities on the front lines of the armistice and openly clamored to keep the Turkish invasion troops in South Korea to serve the American policy of aggression. His so-called "Northeast Asia Treaty Organization" plan is to build this "area where America's allies have not formed a formal defense alliance" into a "northern link of the anti-communist chain" to "encircle" China and the Soviet Union.

    It is not difficult to see that what Dulles is saying is the same old tune that American aggressors have repeatedly sung for a long time. Dulles' repetition of this old tune is obviously directly instructed by the United States and serves the American policy of aggression that undermines peace in the Far East and is hostile to the people of China and the Soviet Union.

    The reason why the United States chose Dulles to undertake this inglorious mission is because its repeated attempts to cobble together a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc have failed in recent years, and it wants to use Dulles to speak from experience. As early as the Korean War, the United States began to piece together this aggressive bloc, but due to the notoriety of the Syngman Rhee clique and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, as well as the deep contradictions between Japan, Rhee, and Chiang, and especially due to the firm opposition of the vast number of people in Asia, the US conspiracy has never been realized. Recently, the Chinese People's Volunteers have begun to withdraw from Korea in batches in order to promote the peaceful reunification of Korea and ease international tensions. This just action, which is conducive to the peaceful reunification of Korea and to peace in the Far East and the world, has been unanimously praised by peace-loving people of all countries. The United States is therefore in an even more embarrassing and isolated situation in Asia. In order to get rid of this situation and intensify tensions in the Far East, the United States has once again stepped up its efforts to piece together a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc, and has retreated behind the scenes, pulling out the Prime Minister of Turkey, which participated in the Baghdad Pact Group, to act as a lobbyist, spreading arguments that undermine peace in the Far East and are hostile to China, in order to clear the way for the United States to cobble together a Northeast Asian aggressive bloc.

    However, in the eyes of the people of Asia, Dulles' reputation is not much better than that of other American lackeys. Turkey has participated in the Baghdad Pact Group planned by the United States and has tried its best to expand its armaments, resulting in Turkey being impoverished and the people living in extreme hardship. This is a vivid example of following the American policy of aggression. Therefore, no matter how shameless and outrageous Dulles's speeches are, the peace-loving people of Asia will not be deceived by him. The people of Asia will resolutely oppose all attempts to serve the American policy of aggression, and Dulles's inglorious mission is destined to fail.

    曼德列斯的不光采的任务
    本报评论员
    土耳其总理曼德列斯在访问了日本和南朝鲜之后，4月28日到了台湾，同蒋介石集团进行了所谓“秘密会谈”。曼德列斯4月19日路经卡拉奇来远东的时候曾表示，他这次到日本、南朝鲜等地访问，是要同这些地方“建立较密切的经济关系”。但是，从他在日本、南朝鲜和台湾的各种表现来看，这种说法只不过是一个幌子，实际上他是负有不光采的任务来到远东的。
    据美国通讯社透露，曼德列斯这次访问远东的真正目的，是企图消除日本、南朝鲜当局以及蒋介石集团之间的分歧，劝它们组织一个所谓“东北亚条约组织”。果然，曼德列斯在日本、南朝鲜和台湾逗留期间，发表了一连串敌视中国人民、破坏远东和平的谈话。他在南朝鲜的时候，曾到停战前线进行积极活动，并公然叫嚣要把土耳其侵朝部队继续留在南朝鲜，为美国的侵略政策服务。他的所谓“东北亚条约组织”计划，就是要把这个“美国的盟国没有组成正式防御联盟的地区”，建成一个“反共锁链的北部环节”，“包围”中国和苏联。
    不难看出，曼德列斯所说的这一套，就是美国侵略者老早一再唱过的滥调。曼德列斯这次旧调重弹，显然是直接受美国指使，并为美国破坏远东和平、敌视中苏人民的侵略政策效劳。
    美国所以选中曼德列斯来担当这个不光采的任务，是因为它近几年来多次拼凑东北亚侵略集团都遭到了失败，想利用曼德列斯来现身说法。早在朝鲜战争期间，美国便开始了拼凑这个侵略集团的活动，但是，由于李承晚集团、蒋介石集团的臭名昭彰，以及日李蒋之间存在着深刻的矛盾，特别是由于亚洲广大人民的坚决反对，美国的这个阴谋一直无法实现。最近，中国人民志愿军为了促进朝鲜的和平统一，缓和国际紧张局势，已经开始分批撤出朝鲜。这一有利于朝鲜和平统一、有利于远东和世界和平的正义行动，得到了各国爱好和平人民的一致赞扬。美国在亚洲的处境也因此更加狼狈和孤立。美国为了摆脱这种处境，加剧远东紧张局势，于是再次加紧拼凑东北亚侵略集团的活动，并退居幕后，拉出参加了巴格达条约集团的土耳其的总理来作说客，散布破坏远东和平、敌视中国的论调，以为美国拼凑东北亚侵略集团扫清道路。
    但是，在亚洲人民的眼中，曼德列斯的声名并不比美国的其他走狗的声名好多少。土耳其参加了美国策划的巴格达条约集团，尽量扩张军备，结果使土耳其弄得民穷财尽，人民生活困苦不堪。这是追随美国侵略政策的活榜样。因此，不管曼德列斯散布了多么无耻的狂言乱语，热爱和平的亚洲人民也不会被他骗住的。亚洲人民将坚决反对为美国侵略政策效劳的一切图谋，曼德列斯的不光采的任务注定是会失败的。
