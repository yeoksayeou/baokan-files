    Research on Yunnan's Jade Dragon Snow Mountain

    The latest issue and the June issue of the "Yunnan University Journal" (Natural Science Edition) published two special issues on the "Vegetation Survey of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain" in Lijiang County, Yunnan. The vegetation survey of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is a key task in the scientific research plan of teachers and students of the Biology Department of Yunnan University.

    Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is a large snow-capped mountain in northwestern Yunnan, reaching a height of 6,000 meters. It not only has complex glacial landforms, but also retains modern glaciers on the summit; the climate varies greatly from the foot of the mountain to the peak. It is world-renowned for its extremely rich variety of plants. As early as the late 19th century, Jade Dragon Snow Mountain had become a place visited and yearned for by botanists from China and abroad. Yunnan's reputation as the "Kingdom of Plants" and "World Garden" is inseparable from Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. However, past scientific research has focused on plant classification. In order to make full use of the natural resources of mountainous areas and promote the development of agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in mountainous areas, it is necessary to have a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the plant resources of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. On the other hand, due to the complex natural environment and rich variety of plants in mountainous areas, the types of "plant communities" are also diverse. They include more than 20 units, ranging from dry grassland types in hot areas to frozen desert types in cold areas. Therefore, it is a typical area for studying the relationship between various plant community types and the environment, and mastering their distribution and development patterns in a concentrated manner. Conducting scientific research on Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is of great significance in both production and scientific research. This research work focuses on comprehensive investigation of plant communities.

    According to the original plan, the field investigation work of this research has been basically completed in the two summers of 1956 and 1957. In addition to the Biology Department of Yunnan University, the participating units also included the Forestry Department and Agricultural Department of Yunnan University, the Kunming Workstation of the Institute of Botany of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Biology Department of Kunming Normal College, the Geography Department of Nanjing University, and biology teachers from Lijiang Middle School. The number of participants before and after, including interns, totaled more than 100 people. Such a large scientific team is unprecedented in Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. The scope of the investigation was also very wide, involving geology, geomorphology, climate, soil, plant system, plant community, plant ecology, forest type classification, and medicinal plants. These works have been summarized in the two issues of the "Yunnan University Journal". Through these scientific articles, the distribution of existing plant resources of Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is comprehensively reflected, and scientific bases for development, utilization, and management are put forward for mountain forests, pastures, and medicinal plants. These data can also be used as a reference for developing and utilizing plant resources in other high-altitude and cold regions.

    This scientific research work is inseparable from the direct leadership and strong support of the Party organization and administration of Yunnan University, as well as the specific assistance of local agricultural production cooperatives. All the work embodies a collective scientific working method and a comprehensive scientific development direction. This is a scientific research method that is compatible with the socialist nature. It is precisely because under the guidance of the spirit of collectivism, through the joint efforts of scientific workers, the work done in the past few decades has been completed and surpassed in just two years. This collective scientific research work has also effectively cultivated young scientific and technological cadres in terms of the attitude of scientific research and the combination of theory and practice.

### 研究云南玉龙山

    研究云南玉龙山
    “云南大学学报”自然科学版最近一期和6月间的一期，对云南丽江县“玉龙山植被调查”出刊两次专号。玉龙山的植被调查是云南大学生物系教师和学生的科研规划中的一项重点工作。
    玉龙山是云南西北部的一座大雪山，高达六千公尺。这里不仅有复杂的冰川地形，而且在山顶还遗留有现代冰川；从山麓到山峰气候变幻无穷。它以极其丰富的植物种类驰名于全世界。早在上一世纪的后期，玉龙山就已经成为中外植物学家涉足和向往的地方。云南之所以有“植物王国”和“世界花园”之称是和玉龙山分不开的。但是，过去的科学研究工作都偏重在植物分类方面。为了充分地利用山区的自然资源，促进山区农、林、畜牧事业的发展，必须对玉龙山的植物资源作全面深入的了解。另一方面，正由于山区自然环境的复杂、植物种类的丰富，反映在“植物群落”的类型上也是多种多样的，它包括了从炎热地区的干草原类型到寒冷地区的冻荒漠类型，共计二十多个单位，所以它为集中地研究各种植物群落类型和环境之间的关系、掌握它们的分布和发展规律，也是一个典型的地区。对玉龙山进行科学研究，不论在生产上或科学研究上，都具有重大意义。这项研究工作以植物群落的综合性调查为主。
    按原订的计划，这项研究的野外调查工作已在1956和1957年的两个夏季内基本完成。参加工作的单位除了云南大学生物系，还有云南大学林学系和农学系，中国科学院植物研究所昆明工作站，昆明师范学院生物系，南京大学地理系，丽江中学的生物学教师等，前后参加人数，包括实习的学生在内，共计一百多人。这样大的科学队伍是玉龙山空前未有的。调查的范围也十分广泛，涉及了地质、地貌、气候、土壤、植物系统、植物群落、植物生态、林型划分、药用植物等方面。这些工作，都已经总结在两期“云南大学学报”中。通过这些科学专文，比较全面地反映了玉龙山现有植物资源的分布状况，也针对山区森林、牧场、药用植物等方面提出了开发、利用、管理的科学根据。这些资料还可以作为开发利用其他高寒山区植物资源的参考。
    这项科学研究工作是同云南大学党组织和行政的直接领导和大力支持，以及当地农业生产合作社的具体协助都是分不开的。全部工作体现了一种集体的科学工作方法和综合性的科学发展方向。这是同社会主义性质相适应的科学研究方式。正因为在集体主义的精神指导下，通过科学工作者的共同努力，才在短短的两年内就完成并超过了过去几十年来所做的工作。这一集体主义的科学研究工作，也有效地在科学研究工作的态度上，在理论与实践相结合等方面培养了年青的科学工作干部。
