    If all the oil extracted worldwide in 1956 were spread evenly across the Earth's surface, it would be one meter thick. Transporting this much oil (over 750 million tons) would require 17.5 million tank cars, each with a capacity of 40 tons. Such an oil transport "train" would stretch over 250,000 kilometers.
    One gram of gold can be drawn into a gold thread 3,420 meters long.
