Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 8th—Technician Li Guangjin of the Longchang Gas Mine has successfully experimented with using natural gas to replace diesel fuel in diesel engines, breaking the outdated theory that many people believed diesel engines could not directly use natural gas as fuel.

The diesel engine Li Guangjin experimented with is used on petroleum exploration sites. Currently, diesel engines in China's petroleum exploration departments all use diesel fuel. On the one hand, the amount of oil consumed is very large, and on the other hand, exploration sites are very scattered, requiring the state to use a large amount of transportation capacity to transport fuel to remote areas. Meanwhile, almost all petroleum exploration areas in the country have natural gas that is not being well utilized. According to Li Guangjin's suggestion, after using natural gas as fuel, each drilling team at the Longchang Gas Mine only uses 35,000 cubic meters of natural gas per month, worth only 294 yuan; while burning diesel fuel requires 28 tons per month, which is much more expensive. The Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Bureau is now organizing forces to actively promote this new technical experience. If Li Guangjin's creation is rapidly promoted throughout the country, it can save even more diesel fuel each year.

Li Guangjin's method of using natural gas to replace diesel fuel to start diesel engines is very simple. It only involves changing the oil supply system on the diesel engine to a gas supply system, mixing natural gas with air and sending it into the diesel engine cylinder, and adding electrical ignition equipment inside the diesel engine. He spent only 200 yuan on replacing all the equipment and parts. Workers rated several major advantages of the machine he modified: (1) It saves diesel fuel for the country; (2) It has great power. In the past, when burning diesel fuel, a 300-horsepower diesel engine could only exert a maximum of 280 horsepower, but now burning natural gas has reached 450 horsepower, greatly exceeding the original design capacity; (3) The machine runs smoothly, with fewer accidents and less non-production time; (4) Operation is convenient and easy. In addition, it also saves valuable equipment such as high-pressure oil pumps and fuel injectors required for burning diesel fuel.

Li Guangjin went to work in a factory as an apprentice at the age of sixteen. He is fifty-one years old this year and has never attended school. When he started this experiment, some engineering technicians believed that it lacked a "theoretical" basis and did not believe that the experiment could succeed. However, Li Guangjin believes that "people are flexible, machines are rigid, as long as you use your brain, anything can be created." With the support of the Longchang Gas Mine Party Committee and the help of workers Zhou Daiyin, Zhu Dalu, and others, he finally succeeded in the recent creation after more than a year.

    天然气开动柴油机
    李光进打破过时理论创造成功经验
    新华社重庆8日电　隆昌气矿技师李光进在柴油机上试验用天然气代替柴油作燃料成功，打破了许多人认为柴油机不能直接用天然气做燃料的过时理论。
    李光进所试验的柴油机是石油勘探工地上使用的。目前我国石油勘探部门的柴油机都是用柴油做燃料。一方面消耗的油量很大，同时勘探工地很分散，国家要用很大的运输力量把油料运到边远地区；另一方面，几乎全国所有的石油探区都有天然气没有很好利用。隆昌气矿根据李光进意见，用天然气做燃料后，每个钻井队每月只用天然气三万五千立方公尺，价值仅二百九十四元；而烧柴油每月却要二十八吨，价值高得多。现在四川石油勘探局正在组织力量积极推广这一新的技术经验。如果迅速将李光进这一创造在全国加以推广，每年就可以节约更多的柴油。
    李光进创造的用天然气代替柴油发动柴油机的方法很简便，只是将柴油机上的输油系统改为输气系统，将天然气与空气混合送入柴油机气缸，另外在柴油机内增加电路点火设备。他改换设备和零件全部只花了二百元钱。工人们给他改装后的机器评定了几大优点：（1）为国家节约了柴油；（2）能力大，过去烧柴油时三百马力的柴油机最高只能发挥出二百八十马力的能力，现在烧天然气已经达到了四百五十马力，大大超过了原来的设计能力；（3）机器运转平稳，事故少，非生产时间少；（4）操作方便省事。此外还节约了烧柴油时所需要的高压油泵、喷油嘴等贵重器材。
    李光进十六岁就到工厂当学徒，今年五十一岁，过去没有上过学。他在开始作这一试验时，有些工程技术人员认为缺乏“理论”上的根据，不相信这一试验能够成功。但是李光进认为“人是活的，机器是死的，只要开动脑筋，什么东西都可以创造得出来”。他在隆昌气矿党委的支持和工人周代银、朱大禄等的帮助下，前后经过一年多的时间，终于在最近创造成功。
