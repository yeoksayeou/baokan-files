Xinhua News Agency, 4th. To enhance the political and theoretical level of the broad masses of cadres, local Party committees of the Chinese Communist Party are taking active measures to cultivate a theoretical contingent that possesses a certain level of Marxist theoretical understanding and practical work experience.

    Fujian
    In order to strengthen the theoretical ranks, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, in addition to transferring a group of cadres from various levels of government, who have undergone revolutionary training, possess mass work experience and theoretical cultivation, to serve as political instructors and Marxist-Leninist theory teachers in middle schools and above, also requires local and municipal Party committees to absorb county Party secretaries to participate in the establishment of philosophy and economics research groups. Ye Fei, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, has also decided to open irregular lectures on philosophy, history and current affairs policies at Fujian Normal College. Lin Xiude, a member of the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee, and Xu Huoqing, a member of the committee, also serve as professors in the Socialist Education Teaching and Research Group of Fujian Normal College. Xu Ya, a member of the Provincial Party Committee, will also teach political economy at the Normal College next semester, serving as a professor in the Political Economy Teaching and Research Group. Local (city) Party secretaries will also frequently lecture on political courses at local secondary schools. Local (city) Party committees have also established lecturers' groups for theoretical courses, with a total of more than one hundred lecturers. Recently, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee of the CPC decided to cultivate a theoretical backbone force of 200 people among the county Party secretaries and Party members of the provincial departments and bureaus. The Provincial Party School will be responsible for training political teachers for middle schools, and the Prefectural Party School will be responsible for training political teachers for people-run middle schools, to meet the needs of the objective situation.
    Hunan
    Hunan Province currently has 1,200 full-time theoretical teachers. In accordance with the principle of "consolidating and expanding full-time theoretical teachers, cultivating and developing part-time theoretical teachers at the same time," it is planned to cultivate a group of 1,400 to 1,900 full-time theoretical work cadres within five years, starting this year. These cadres should have systematically studied Marxist-Leninist classics, possess certain practical work experience, be of good political quality, and be consistent in theory and practice. It is required that each county cultivate at least 2-4 people (12 people will be trained this year), each prefecture (city) Party committee should cultivate 20 people, and provincial-level organizations should cultivate 30 people. This year, 190 full-time theoretical teachers will be assigned to organizations above the prefecture (city) level. At the same time, it is required that 10% of the full-time theoretical workers reach the level of theoretical experts. In order to closely integrate theory with practice, each teacher must participate in labor or grassroots work for at least three months each year.
    The province also plans to develop 11,200 part-time theoretical workers (including theoretical teachers from townships, people-run middle schools, factories, mines, and provincial, prefectural, and county-level organizations) within five years. The methods are: (1) To organize writing groups. Select a group of Party member cadres with theoretical qualifications from the province to the county to form writing groups, and conduct theoretical research through summarizing work and use theory to guide work. (2) Establish a researcher system. On the principle of not increasing the establishment, set up two researchers in organs with more than 50 people, and three to five in organs with more than 100 people, to undertake research and lecturing work. (3) Implement "creative holidays." Give comrades in practical work departments and theoretical workers who do not work in research institutions a certain amount of time, tasks, and topics, so that they can carry out theoretical research. This method will be tested in provincial-level agencies first.
    Shaanxi
    The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee of the CPC will open a training class for socialist education courses on May 5, training more than 800 theoretical teachers, some of whom are CPC county party secretaries. According to the theoretical special research determined by the Provincial Party Committee, more than 40 cadres at the level equivalent to the director of a hall or bureau have determined their own research topics and study plans. Leading cadres in Sanyuan, Yaoxian, Tongchuan, Xixiang, Pingli and other counties have started studying according to their self-ordered study plans, and some counties have also established special research groups. In recent years, the number of theoretical teachers in Shaanxi Province has increased to more than 800, with an average of two theoretical teachers in each county. Party schools and universities have also cultivated a number of relatively excellent Marxist-Leninist teachers. Since this spring, more than 500 theoretical teachers have been drawn from various places to participate in rural labor training and short-term assistance work.
    Shandong
    The Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC is training theoretical teachers in batches. The first batch of 298 people has completed training, and the second batch of more than 500 people will begin training in the first and middle ten days of May. More than 400 people are studying socialist education courses in the training class for middle school political teachers organized by the Provincial Department of Education. The Provincial Party Committee has decided that during the second five-year plan, 500 theoretical cadres who are both red and expert with the level of lecturers will be cultivated in this team. At the same time, some veteran cadres with certain practical work experience and theoretical level will be transferred to enrich the theoretical work force.
    Jilin
    In the past year and a half, Jilin Province has cultivated 1,360 full-time political theory teaching cadres. Half of this contingent was trained and cultivated by Party schools; many also have grassroots work experience.
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    There are now more than 250 Marxist-Leninist theory teachers in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. In the theoretical teams of Hulunbuir League, Jirem League, Bayannur League, and Yikezhao League, there are varying numbers of Mongolian and other ethnic minorities. In Xilin Gol League, almost all theoretical work is undertaken by Mongolian theoretical cadres. In the theoretical work of Inner Mongolia, Marxist-Leninist theory on ethnic issues, the Party's ethnic policies, and animal husbandry policies are all frequently studied topics.
    The provincial Party committees of the CPC in Liaoning, Jilin, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu are also carrying out work to strengthen the cultivation of theoretical teams.

    各地党委采取措施
    壮大理论工作队伍
    新华社4日讯　为了提高广大干部的政治理论水平，各地中共党委正在采取积极措施，培养一支具有一定的马克思主义理论水平和实际工作锻炼的理论队伍。
    福建
    福建省委为了加强理论队伍，除了从各级机关中抽调一批经过革命锻炼、有群众工作经验和理论修养的干部担任中等学校以上政治课和马列主义理论教员，还要求各地、市委要吸收县委书记参加，分别成立哲学、经济学两个研究小组。省委第一书记叶飞并已决定在福建师范学院开办有关哲学、历史和时事政策等方面的不定期讲座，省委会常务委员林修德、委员许或青还兼任了福建师范学院社会主义教育课教研组教授，省委委员许亚也将在下学期到师范学院讲授政治经济学，担任政治经济学教研组教授。各地、县委书记也将经常到所在中等学校讲授政治课。各地（市）委并分别建立了理论课讲师团，共有讲师一百多人。最近，中共福建省委决定在各地、县委书记和省直厅局党组成员中培养一支二百人的理论骨干队伍，省委党校要负责培养中学的政治课师资、地委党校负责培养民办中学的政治课师资，以适应客观形势的需要。
    湖南

    内蒙古自治区现在有马列主义理论教员二百五十多人，在呼伦贝尔盟、哲里木盟、巴彦淖尔盟和伊克昭盟的理论队伍中，有数量不等的蒙古族和其他少数民族，锡林郭勒盟的理论工作几乎全部是由蒙古族的理论干部担当起来的。在内蒙古的理论工作中，马列主义关于民族问题的理论、党的民族政策和牧业政策等都是经常研究的课题。
    辽宁、吉林、浙江、江西、江苏等省的中共省委也都在进行加强培养理论队伍的工作。
