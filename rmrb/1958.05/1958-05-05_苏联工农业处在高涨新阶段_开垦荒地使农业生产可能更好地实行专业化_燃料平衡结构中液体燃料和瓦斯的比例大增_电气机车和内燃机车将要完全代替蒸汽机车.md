Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 4th - Kuzmin, Chairman of the Soviet State Planning Committee, said in a recent issue of "Young Communist" magazine that the Soviet Union is now in a new stage of advancing towards communism. He said that the Soviet socialist economy is not only experiencing a further rapid upsurge but is also undergoing profound qualitative changes.

Kuzmin's article discussed the qualitative changes taking place in various sectors of the national economy. When discussing the development of agricultural production, he pointed out the particularly important role of large-scale reclamation of wasteland. He said that due to the reclamation of 36 million hectares of wasteland, grain production has greatly increased, which allows the Soviet Union to have sufficient grain to supply the national population, complete foreign trade plans, and ensure necessary reserves, even in the case of crop failures in many areas. On the other hand, the reclamation of wasteland not only expanded the planting area of crops but also created conditions for fundamental qualitative changes in agricultural production and the implementation of more rational agricultural management. The reclamation of wasteland makes it possible for Soviet agricultural production to be better specialized in different economic regions of the country. For example, after establishing a new base for grain production in the east, Ukraine, which used to mainly produce grain, can now begin to specialize in the production of sugar beets, meat, and the cultivation of hybrid corn. The three Baltic republics can also specialize in developing animal husbandry based on their favorable conditions.

Kuzmin then pointed out that profound qualitative changes are also taking place in the Soviet industrial sector. He cited the development of the oil, coal, and gas industries as examples. Not long ago, such as during the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1946-1950), the fuel produced and used in the Soviet Union was mainly solid fuel such as coal. During that period, solid fuel accounted for 80% of the fuel balance structure, oil accounted for 20%, and natural gas was completely absent. This fuel balance structure was uneconomical, expensive, and not adapted to the requirements of technological progress. Kuzmin said that according to the new structure, solid fuel will account for 37%, liquid fuel will account for 38%, and gas will account for 25%. If the original fuel balance structure had been maintained, then an additional 240 billion rubles would have been spent on fuel production in the past fifteen years. That would have dispersed funds for the development of the fuel industry, damaged the development of other most important sectors of the national economy, and reduced the speed of industrial growth.

In railway transportation, according to the decision of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the Soviet Union will completely replace steam locomotives with electric and internal combustion locomotives in the future, which has brought about a qualitative change in the development of railway transportation.

Kuzmin pointed out that the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has formulated a magnificent plan for the development of national productive forces and is resolutely fighting to achieve a new upsurge in the national economy and culture, and to catch up with and surpass the most developed capitalist countries in terms of per capita product output.

This program determines the fundamental direction of the seven-year prospective plan for the development of the national economy that is currently being formulated.

Kuzmin finally pointed out that in recent years, the task of developing the national economy of the Soviet Union has been, first and foremost, to widely develop the chemical industry, especially the production of synthetic materials such as plastics, artificial fibers, artificial leather, artificial fur, and other synthetic substances. The second is to fully develop the metallurgical industry, especially iron ore bases. The third is to implement a huge housing construction plan. The fourth is to maximize the development of the oil and gas industries, and so on.

    苏联工农业处在高涨新阶段
    开垦荒地使农业生产可能更好地实行专业化
    燃料平衡结构中液体燃料和瓦斯的比例大增
    电气机车和内燃机车将要完全代替蒸汽机车
    新华社莫斯科4日电　苏联国家计划委员会主席库兹明在最近一期“青年共产党人”杂志上发表文章说，苏联现在正处在向共产主义前进的新阶段。他说，苏联的社会主义经济目前不仅在进一步急剧高涨，而且正在发生深刻的质的变化。
    库兹明的文章谈到了国民经济各部门中所发生的质的变化。他在谈到农业生产的发展时指出了大规模开垦荒地的特别重要的作用。他说，由于开垦了三千六百万公顷荒地，粮食的产量大大增加了，这使得苏联即使在许多地方歉收的情况下，也可以拥有足够的粮食来供应全国居民食用、完成对外贸易计划和保证必要的储备。另一方面，开垦荒地不只是扩大了农作物的播种面积，而且还为农业生产发展的根本性的质的变化和实行更合理的农业经营创造了条件。开垦荒地使得苏联的农业生产有可能在全国不同的经济地区更好地实行专业化。例如，在东部建立了生产谷物的新基地以后，过去主要生产谷物的乌克兰现在就可以在生产甜菜、肉类和培植杂交玉蜀黍等方面开始专业化。波罗的海地区三个加盟共和国也有可能根据它们的有利条件在发展畜牧业方面实行专业化。
    库兹明接着指出，苏联工业部门也在发生着深刻的质的变化。他举出石油、煤炭和瓦斯这三个工业部门的发展为例。在不久前，例如在第四个五年计划（1946—1950年）期间，苏联生产和使用的燃料主要是煤炭等固体燃料。在那个时期的燃料平衡结构中，固体燃料占80％，石油占20％，天然瓦斯完全没有。这种燃料平衡结构是不经济的、花费昂贵的，同技术进步的要求不相适应。库兹明说，按照新的结构，固体燃料将占37％，液体燃料占38％，瓦斯占25％。假如按照原来的燃料平衡结构，那么最近十五年内在生产燃料方面就要额外支出二千四百亿卢布。那样就会分散发展燃料工业的资金，损害国民经济其他最重要部门的发展，降低工业增长的速度。
    在铁路运输方面，根据苏共中央的决议，苏联今后要完全以电气机车和内燃机车代替蒸汽机车，这就使铁路运输事业的发展起着质的变化。
    库兹明指出，苏联共产党制定了发展全国生产力的宏伟规划，坚决为争取国民经济和文化的新高涨、为在按人口平均计算产品产量方面赶上和超过最发达的资本主义国家而斗争。
    这个纲领决定了现在正在制定的发展国民经济七年远景计划的根本方向。
    库兹明最后指出，最近几年，苏联发展国民经济的任务首先是广泛发展化学工业，特别是生产合成材料。塑料、人造纤维、人造皮革、人造毛皮以及其他合成物质。第二是全力发展冶金工业，特别是铁矿基地。第三是实现巨大的住宅建筑计划，第四是尽量发展石油工业和瓦斯工业等。
