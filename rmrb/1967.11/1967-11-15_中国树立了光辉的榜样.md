Recently, at an exhibition in Santiago, the capital of Chile, introducing the People's Republic of China, many friends from Chile and other Latin American countries visiting Chile, after visiting the exhibition, wrote down enthusiastic messages expressing their boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao, and enthusiastically praised the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao.

A Chilean worker wrote: "The great Mao Zedong-led China has set a brilliant example for us." Another worker wrote: "I am a son of the Chilean people. Socialism will inevitably be established throughout the world because it is the highest justice of mankind." An employee wrote: "The example of the Chinese people under the leadership of Chairman Mao is an inspiration and encouragement to the peoples of all countries who are struggling for liberation. The peoples of all countries are proud of the scientific and technological progress achieved by the Chinese people."

Students from Puerto Rico, Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela studying at the University of Santiago specially came to the exhibition to learn about China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

A visiting Argentine friend in Chile wrote after the visit: "Long live Mao Zedong Thought, Marxism-Leninism!"

During the visit, many Chilean workers and students also requested copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other brilliant works of Chairman Mao from the Chile-China Friendship Association. They said: "This is the best weapon for our struggle for the liberation of Chile."

    中国树立了光辉的榜样
    最近，在智利首都圣地亚哥举办的介绍中华人民共和国的展览会上，许多智利和其他在智利的拉丁美洲国家的朋友，参观了展览会后，纷纷写下了热情洋溢的留言，表达了他们对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和敬意，热情赞扬中国人民在毛主席的领导下所取得的辉煌成就。
    一位智利工人写道：“伟大的毛泽东领导的中国为我们提供了一个光辉的榜样。”另一位工人写道：“我是智利人民的儿子。社会主义必将在全世界建立起来，因为它是人类最崇高的正义事业。”一位职员写道：“在毛主席领导下的中国人民的榜样对于正在争取解放的各国人民来说，是一个激励和鼓舞。各国人民为中国人民取得的科学和技术进步感到自豪。”
    在圣地亚哥大学学习的波多黎各、巴西、秘鲁、阿根廷、哥伦比亚和委内瑞拉的学生特地到展览会来学习中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    一位访问智利的阿根廷朋友在参观后写道：“毛泽东思想、马克思列宁主义万岁！”
    在参观过程中，许多智利工人和学生还向智中友协索要了《毛主席语录》和毛主席的其他光辉著作。他们说：“这是我们争取智利解放斗争的最好的武器。”
