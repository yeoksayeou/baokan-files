    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    The people's commune is good.
    The Chinese Khrushchev's lies: Some comrades say that the people's commune was established too early. If we did not establish the commune, would it be better? Perhaps it would be better at that time. It is possible to establish it a few years later.

    The Benefits of People's Communes Are Endless

    Wang Hu Guan, an old poor peasant from the Second Production Brigade

    The Chinese Khrushchev slanders that the people's commune was established too early and has been ruined, which is sheer nonsense and extremely malicious.

    Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The people's commune is good." He has spoken the words from the hearts of us poor and lower-middle peasants, pointing out the direction for the advancement of the five hundred million peasants. The people's commune is the happy path to common prosperity and the golden bridge to communism. In 1958, Chairman Mao led us to establish the people's commune, which fully met the urgent demands of us broad poor and lower-middle peasants. We are deeply grateful to our great leader Chairman Mao for leading us to take a big step forward on the socialist road. The class enemies are most afraid of the people's commune, most hate the people's commune, and most oppose the establishment of the people's commune. They spread rumors and lies, saying that the people's commune was established too early and has been ruined, dreaming of disintegrating our collective economy and restoring capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev slanders that the people's commune was established too early and has been ruined, which fully proves that he is the spokesperson for the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and the backer of ghosts and monsters.

    The people's commune is good, the people's commune is indeed good, the collective strength is boundless, and people change their thoughts and the land changes its appearance. The people's commune has many people, much land, much capital, and great strength, making it easy to carry out collective undertakings and fully liberate productive forces. It is because of the people's commune that we have agricultural mechanization. Now in our brigade, there are tractors for plowing, electric irrigation stations for watering, sprayers for pest control, and threshers for harvesting, which greatly promote production development. Because the people's commune has the superiority of "being big and public," production develops year by year, and the yields of rice and cotton are like sesame flowers blooming higher and higher. This year, after transplanting seedlings, it did not rain for more than a hundred days. Without the people's commune and mechanization, the crops would wither, and people would suffer. With the people's commune as our backbone, we have overcome the severe drought.

    In short, the benefits of the people's commune are endless. Every time we talk about the changes before and after the establishment of the commune, we feel even more deeply that Chairman Mao's judgment of "the people's commune is good" is indeed brilliant and indeed correct.

    However, the Chinese Khrushchev, in collusion with domestic and foreign class enemies, maliciously attacks the people's commune, saying that it was established too early and has been ruined, and sings the opposite tune to Chairman Mao. His purpose is to drag us back to the old capitalist road, with evil intentions. If his plot succeeds, we will suffer twice and be wronged twice, and the landlords and rich peasants will ride on our heads again. We will not agree to this in a thousand ways, nor in ten thousand ways.

    Chairman Mao cares for us poor and lower-middle peasants and leads us on the bright socialist road. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, frantically opposes the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought, opposes the people's commune, and opposes the three red banners, attempting to lead us onto the capitalist road of death. He is our mortal enemy. We must consolidate the collective economy and walk the socialist road. We must definitely overthrow him and refute his fallacies so that they stink for ten thousand years.

### 人民公社好处说不完

    毛主席语录
    人民公社好。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：有的同志说，人民公社办早了。不办公社，是不是更好一点？当时不办，也许可能好一点。迟几年办是可以的。
    人民公社好处说不完
    第二生产队老贫农　王虎观
    中国的赫鲁晓夫诬蔑人民公社办早了，搞糟了，真是胡说八道，恶毒透顶。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“人民公社好。”他老人家说出了我们贫下中农的心里话，为我们五亿农民指出了前进的方向。人民公社是走向共同富裕的幸福路，通向共产主义的金桥。一九五八年毛主席领导我们办人民公社，完全符合我们广大贫下中农的迫切要求。我们从心底里感激伟大领袖毛主席领导我们在社会主义道路上跨一大步。阶级敌人最怕人民公社，最恨人民公社，最反对我们办人民公社。他们煽阴风，点鬼火，胡说什么人民公社办早了，搞糟了，梦想瓦解我们的集体经济，复辟资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫诬蔑人民公社办早了，搞糟了，完全是和地富反坏右穿的一条裤子，唱的一个调子，这充分证明了他是地富反坏右的代言人，牛鬼蛇神的总后台。
    人民公社好，人民公社就是好，集体力量大无边，人换思想地换貌。人民公社人多田多资金多力量大，好办集体事业，充分解放了生产力。有了人民公社，才有农业机械化。现在我们大队里耕田有拖拉机，打水有电灌站，除虫有喷雾器，打谷有脱粒机，大大促进了生产发展。正因为人民公社有“一大二公”的优越性，生产年年发展，水稻、棉花产量都象芝麻开花节节高。今年栽秧以后，一百多天没落雨，要没有人民公社，没有机械化，庄稼要干煞，人要苦煞；有了人民公社作靠山，我们就战胜了严重的干旱。
    总之，人民公社的好处三天三夜也说不完。每当我们谈起公社化前后的变化，我们就更加深深地感到，伟大领袖毛主席的“人民公社好”的论断，实在英明，实在正确。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫伙同国内外阶级敌人恶毒地攻击人民公社办早了，搞糟了，和毛主席唱对台戏。他的目的是要把我们拉回资本主义的老路上去，用心毒透又毒透。如果他的阴谋得逞，我们就要吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，地主富农就会重新骑到我们贫下中农头上。我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    毛主席关心我们贫下中农，领导我们走社会主义的光明大道。中国的赫鲁晓夫却疯狂地反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，反对人民公社，反对三面红旗，妄想把我们引入资本主义死路上去。他是我们贫下中农的死对头。我们要巩固集体经济，走社会主义道路，一定要把他彻底打倒，把他的谬论批得个遗臭万年。
