Anzai Kūji writes to vehemently criticize the "peaceful revolution" capitulationist fallacies of the Nihon Kyōsantō (Japan Communist Party) revisionist clique led by Miyamoto Kenji.

Violent revolution is the universal law of the proletarian revolution.

The Japanese revolutionary faction must take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as their guiding principles.

The head of the Nihon Kyōsantō, Miyamoto, is a genuine Japanese Khrushchev and the most despicable traitor.

Xinhua News Agency, November 15th: Tokyo News: Former Central Committee member and Secretariat member of the Japanese Communist Party, Japanese revolutionary leftist Anzai Kūji, recently published a lengthy article in the journal "Mao Zedong Thought Studies," criticizing the capitulationist theory of "peaceful revolution" advocated by the Miyamoto revisionist clique.

In his article, Anzai Kūji points out that during the drafting of the current platform of the Japanese Communist Party, Miyamoto vigorously attempted to remove one of the most important doctrines of Marxism-Leninism, namely, "violent revolution is the universal law of the proletarian revolution," "armed struggle is the highest form of class struggle," and "the fate of the revolution is decided by armed struggle." Such revolutionary ideas. Miyamoto stated in the Central Committee's report on the platform issue: "The 1951 platform determined that: 'The idea that the democratic reforms that can achieve Japan's liberation through peaceful means is wrong.' This platform completely denies the historical and theoretical possibility of such changes, binding itself with the one-sided theory of the inevitability of violent revolution, which is obviously not suitable for today's situation." In this way, Miyamoto has suppressed the revolutionary spirit of the past platform, changing the basic line of the Japanese Communist Party into the modern revisionist "peaceful revolution theory," using the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful road" to bind the hands and feet of the Japanese working class and people, making the Japanese working class and all the people kneel before American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries. His report is actually a declaration of surrender to the enemy, a white flag of surrender to American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

In his article, Anzai Kūji refutes the fallacy of the Miyamoto revisionist clique that there is now a "possibility of peaceful revolution" in Japan based on Japan's real situation. The article points out that the politically conscious working class in Japan is well aware that Japan, under the semi-occupation of American imperialism, cannot consider "peacefully" carrying out a revolution. However, the Miyamoto revisionist clique advocates that there is now a possibility of "peaceful development of the revolution" in Japan. It says that the domestic and international situation now is very different from Lenin's time. The article asks, has the American imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries ruling Japan become "peaceful forces" that can "peacefully" hand over their power to the Japanese working class? The article points out that before the American imperialism launched the Korean War in 1950, it suppressed the Japanese Communist Party. Now, the American and Japanese reactionaries have established a standing army of nearly 300,000 ("Self-Defense Forces") and nearly 200,000 police in Japan, and as revealed by the Public Security Action Bill and the Sanya Operation Plan, they are sharpening their swords, intending to attack the people. However, the Miyamoto revisionist clique, ignoring these realities in Japan, repeatedly sings the lullaby of the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful road," putting the people to sleep and making them unprepared for the enemy's suppression. Therefore, Miyamoto's "theory" is a "narcotic" that puts the people in a state of danger, a theory of capitulationists. The article points out that Miyamoto is a genuine Japanese Khrushchev and the most despicable traitor.

The article states that what the Japanese people need now is neither a "leader" like Miyamoto nor the harmful fallacies of Miyamoto's "narcotic." What the Japanese people need is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as the proposals of the Communist Party of China led by Comrade Mao Zedong. The Communist Party of China points out: "Facts show that today, all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations, in order to carry out a revolution and strive for liberation, not only must deal with the violent suppression of the reactionary ruling class in their own country, but must also be fully prepared to deal with armed intervention from imperialism, especially American imperialism. Without such preparation, it is impossible to talk about revolution, let alone the victory of the revolution." Japanese communists must firmly remember this very important warning from the Communist Party of China.

The article points out that Miyamoto's "theory" betrays Marxism-Leninism's revolutionary doctrines on war. Communists believe that wars between imperialist countries for the plunder of wealth, imperialist invasions of colonies and dependent countries, and imperialist invasions of socialist countries are all unjust wars that must be firmly opposed; on the other hand, wars of liberation by oppressed nations to free themselves from oppression, civil wars by the proletariat to achieve socialism, and defensive wars by socialist countries to resist imperialist aggression are all just wars that must be firmly supported. However, from Miyamoto's "theory," we deeply feel that he denies the legitimacy, progressiveness, and inevitability of domestic revolutionary wars and clearly shows his dislike, aversion, and hostility towards them. He even curses the proletarian violent revolution and the conduct of domestic wars as "extreme leftist adventurism" and "Blanquism." In this way, as Lenin said, he has politically and ideologically degenerated into a faithful servant of the bourgeoisie and has now become an unrepentant traitor and capitulationist. We must firmly remember Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun."

The article states that the current reality in Japan is not the so-called "possibility of a peaceful transition" advocated by the Miyamoto revisionist clique, but the possibility of being drawn into the aggressive wars constantly instigated by American imperialism. When Japan is drawn into the aggressive war instigated by American imperialism, the only revolutionary slogan for Japanese communists is "turn the imperialist war into a civil war!" The Miyamoto revisionist clique, which fears and detests civil war, may regard this sole revolutionary slogan as an "unpleasant and extremely cruel" slogan. However, when imperialist war occurs, only this revolutionary slogan can save the Japanese people from the imperialist camp. Therefore, Japanese communists, regardless of how the Miyamoto revisionist clique curses, will never abandon the slogan "turn the imperialist war into a civil war!" We will also not abandon the truth that "armed struggle is the universal law of the proletarian revolution."

The article concludes by stating that we also advocate for peace. However, to eliminate war, as long as imperialism exists for a single day, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "War—this monster of mutual slaughter among humans, this monster of human society—will ultimately be eliminated by the development of human society, and it will be eliminated in the not-too-distant future. But the method to eliminate it is only one: to oppose war with war, to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war, to oppose national counter-revolutionary war with national revolutionary war, and to oppose class counter-revolutionary war with class revolutionary war." We must dare to oppose counter-revolutionary war with revolutionary war.

### 暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律

    安斋库治撰文痛斥日修宫本集团的“和平革命”的投降主义谬论
    暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律
    日本革命派必须以马列主义、毛泽东思想为指导方针
    日修头目宫本是货真价实的日本的赫鲁晓夫和最丑恶的叛徒
    新华社十五日讯东京消息：前日共中央委员、书记处书记、日本革命左派安斋库治不久前在《毛泽东思想研究》杂志上发表长篇文章，批判宫本修正主义集团的投降主义理论“和平革命论”。
    安斋库治在文章中指出，宫本在拟订日本共产党目前纲领的过程中，极力从日共过去的纲领中抽掉马克思列宁主义最重要的学说之一，即“暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律”、“武装斗争是阶级斗争的最高形式”、“决定革命命运的是武装斗争”这样的革命思想。宫本在中央委员会关于纲领问题的报告中说：“一九五一年纲领断定说：‘认为用和平的手段能够求得日本的解放的民主改革是错误的。’这个纲领从思想上完全否定了这种变革的历史上和理论上的可能性，用暴力革命不可避免论来片面地束缚住自己的手脚，这显然是不适合于今天的情况的。”这样，宫本就扼杀了过去纲领中的革命精神，把日本共产党的基本路线修改成为现代修正主义的“和平革命论”，用“议会道路”、“和平道路”来束缚日本工人阶级和人民的手脚，要日本工人阶级和全体人民拜倒在美帝国主义和日本反动派的面前。他的报告实际上是把日本共产党的革命传统出卖给敌人的宣誓书，是向美帝国主义和日本反动派举起投降的白旗。
    安斋库治在文章中根据日本的现实情况驳斥了宫本修正主义集团认为现在日本存在着“和平进行革命的可能性”的谬论。文章指出，日本有政治觉悟的工人阶级都很清楚，处在美帝国主义半占领状态下的日本，不能考虑“和平”地进行革命。但是，宫本修正主义集团却宣扬现在日本存在“和平发展革命”的可能性。它说什么现在国内外形势与列宁时代相比，发生了很大的变化。文章说，难道统治日本的美帝国主义和日本反动派已经变为“和平力量”，能够
  “和平”地把自己的政权移交给日本工人阶级吗？文章指出，一九五○年美帝国主义发动侵朝战争之前，就镇压了日本共产党。现在美日反动派在日本建立了近三十万人的常备军（“自卫队”）和近二十万人的警察，而且正象治安行动草案和三矢作战计划所暴露出来的那样，它们正在磨刀擦枪，企图袭击人民。而宫本修正主义集团不顾日本的这些现实情况，不断地唱着“议会道路”“和平道路”的催眠曲使人民陷入睡眠状态，对敌人的镇压毫无防备。因此宫本的“理论”是使人民处于危险的时候陷入睡眠状态的“麻药”，是投降主义者的理论。文章指出，宫本是货真价实的日本的赫鲁晓夫和最丑恶的叛徒。
    文章说，现在日本人民所需要的既不是象宫本那样的“领导者”，也不是宫本的象“麻药”那样的有害的谬论。我们日本人民所需要的是马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想以及毛泽东同志领导的中国共产党的主张。中国共产党指出：“事实说明：今天，一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族，要进行革命，要争取解放，不但必须对付本国反动统治阶级的暴力镇压，而且必须充分准备对付来自帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的武装干涉。没有这种准备，不坚决在必要的时候用革命的暴力回击反革命的暴力，就根本谈不上革命，更谈不到革命的胜利。”日本的共产主义者要牢牢记住中国共产党的这一非常重要的忠告。
    文章指出，宫本“理论”背叛马克思列宁主义关于战争的革命学说。共产主义者认为帝国主义国家之间为了掠夺财富而进行的战争、帝国主义侵略殖民地附属国的战争、帝国主义侵略社会主义国家的战争，都是非正义的战争，要坚决反对；与此相反，被压迫民族为了从压迫下解放出来而进行的解放战争、无产阶级为了实现社会主义而进行的国内战争、社会主义国家为抵抗帝国主义的侵略而进行的自卫战争，都是正义的战争，必须坚决予以支持。但是我们从宫本的“理论”中深深地感到他否定国内革命战争的正当性、进步性和必然性，并对它表示明显的嫌恶、忌讳和敌意，他甚至痛骂无产阶级的暴力革命和进行国内战争是什么“极左冒险主义”、“布朗基主义”。这样，他正如列宁所说的那样，已在政治上思想上腐化堕落到充当资产阶级忠实的奴仆，如今堕落成了不折不扣的叛徒和投降主义者。我们必须牢牢记住毛泽东同志这样的教导：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”
    文章说，目前日本的现实不是宫本修正主义集团所说的什么“实现和平过渡的可能性”等等，而是被卷入美帝国主义不断制造的侵略战争的可能性。日本被卷进美帝国主义煽动起来的侵略战争时，日本的共产主义者的唯一革命的口号就是“把帝国主义的战争变为国内战争！”害怕和嫌恶国内战争的宫本修正主义集团也许把这个唯一革命的口号看成是“不愉快的极其残酷的”口号。但是，当帝国主义战争发生的时候，只有这个革命的口号才能够把日本人民从帝国主义的阵营中解救出来。因此我们日本的共产主义者不管宫本修正主义集团怎样咒骂，绝不放弃“把帝国主义的战争变为国内战争！”这个口号，我们同样也不能抛弃“武装斗争是无产阶级革命的普遍规律”这个真理。
    文章最后说，我们也要求和平。但是，为了消灭战争，只要帝国主义存在一天，就要按照毛主席的“战争——这个人类互相残杀的怪物，人类社会的发展终久要把它消灭的，而且就在不远的将来会要把它消灭的。但是消灭它的方法只有一个，就是用战争反对战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争，用阶级革命战争反对阶级反革命战争”的教导，敢于用革命战争反对反革命战争。
