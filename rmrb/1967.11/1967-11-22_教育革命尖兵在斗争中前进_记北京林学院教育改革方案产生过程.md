	Educational Revolution Pioneers Advance Through Struggle
	—Recording the Process of the Beijing Forestry College Educational Reform Plan

	Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "Correct things always develop through struggle against incorrect things." The experience of Beijing Forestry College in abolishing teaching and research sections and establishing specialized platoons fully illustrates this truth.

	The proletarian educational revolution is a completely new undertaking. Every step forward it takes must go through struggle. The proposal to establish specialized platoons was made as early as 1958. However, from the very beginning, it encountered resistance and sabotage from the revisionist educational line promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents, and this struggle continued for eight or nine years.

	However, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, the vitality of new things is immense. The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Forestry College, through arduous struggle, have finally achieved victory.

	The specialized platoons have been established, but the struggle has not ended. They must continue to consolidate and expand their victories through repeated practice and struggle.

	Currently, all primary and secondary schools are resuming classes and making revolution, focusing their efforts on revolutionary criticism and rectification within their units. Only by thoroughly criticizing the revisionist educational line and completely eliminating the old educational system can we implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and establish a new proletarian educational system. In necessary circumstances, a small number of people can be organized, planned, and led to go deep into the local workers and peasants to conduct investigations and research, enriching the content of educational reform.

	After the publication of Beijing Forestry College's educational reform plan, revolutionary teachers and students from various places have asked: "Why did you abolish the teaching and research sections and establish specialized platoons? How did you come to this path?"

	The path taken by Beijing Forestry College is a path of struggle.

	Historical Lessons of Revolutionary Struggle

	The wheel of history rolls forward, and class struggle on the educational front has never ceased. Turning the pages of Beijing Forestry College's fifteen-year history, which page is not a history of class struggle?!

	Over the past decade, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and a few reactionary academic "authorities" under their protection have colluded, using the banner of "experts running schools and professors managing colleges" to control the school's leadership, exclude party leadership, and attack party leaders. Especially, the teaching and research sections they controlled held a series of teaching powers, such as formulating teaching outlines, reviewing and editing textbooks, and deciding teaching content and methods, becoming an important tool for them to promote the revisionist educational line and a stubborn stronghold to resist and oppose Chairman Mao's educational line.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Education must serve proletarian politics and be combined with productive labor." However, they used their leadership and positions to inject a large amount of bourgeois and revisionist poison into revolutionary youth, cultivating bourgeois successors. Many students, after entering the school, "heard nothing outside the window and read only the classics," and in a few years, due to severe detachment from reality and politics, not only were they deeply poisoned, but their thoughts were also rigid, and their physical and mental health were severely damaged.

	Over the past decade, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Forestry College, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have repeatedly attacked the revisionist educational line and the teaching and research section system. In 1958, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Forestry College, with great revolutionary spirit, deeply implemented Chairman Mao's policy of combining education with productive labor, broke through the constraints of the teaching and research section system, organized platoons according to the militia organization, went to factories and forest areas, and carried out "three-in-one" comprehensive labor teaching of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and production experts. Various teaching and research sections coordinated, and professional and basic courses were linked to form a one-stop teaching method. However, this new thing was strangled by a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party under the pretext of "stabilizing teaching order."

	In 1960, based on the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Forestry College once again criticized the bourgeoisie and reformed the old teaching content and methods. In the departments, the party branch committee leadership system was implemented, and in the teaching and research sections, a "three-in-one" leadership team consisting of the section head, teachers, and students led the educational reform. However, in 1961, a strange wind blew across the educational front. The bourgeois headquarters led by Chinese Khrushchev launched a mad attack on Chairman Mao's educational line. The small clique of capitalist roaders within the party, following their master's intentions, under the pretext of "everything for teaching," monopolized all powers and cut off all educational reform achievements. In the spring of 1964, Chairman Mao issued instructions on educational revolution, but they remained inactive and stubbornly resisted.

	Why can't Chairman Mao's educational line be well implemented here? After years of class struggle and especially the practice of the Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Forestry College clearly saw: it was because Chinese Khrushchev promoted a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. They deeply felt: "Without eliminating the revisionist educational line, we cannot establish Chairman Mao's educational line; without destroying the old system, we cannot create a new system."

	Learning Struggle Through Struggle

	In the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Forestry College, hoisting the revolutionary banner of "rebellion is justified," seized the leadership from a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party. However, the struggle did not end.

	In June, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee issued the battle call to "resume classes and make revolution," and the proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing Forestry College responded immediately.

	Resuming classes and making revolution is a new topic. How should it be done? Some said: "How to resume classes? There is no plan yet. Let's wait and see!"

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is the people's business. It is often not learned first and then done, but done first and then learned. Doing is learning." The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Forestry College did not wait but followed Chairman Mao's instructions, fully mobilized the masses, dared to practice, and dared to innovate.

	The East Is Red Commune's August 18th Combat Team, May Fourth Combat Team, and Zunyi Combat Team and other combat organizations were the first to post big-character posters:

	Please teachers immediately leave the teaching and research sections and come to us to organize specialized platoons and carry out the tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform in our college to the end...

	The vast number of revolutionary teachers and students firmly supported this revolutionary big-character poster. Many revolutionary teachers went to the classes and were warmly welcomed by revolutionary students.

	This revolutionary action frightened a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and a few reactionary academic "authorities." They came out from the dark corners, spreading rumors: "This is an attempt to annex the teachers!" "This is to form a faction and attack another faction!" They tried to win hearts and minds and buy off the masses, attempting to sabotage the resumption of classes and making revolution. They first instigated some cadres and teachers who had made mistakes due to being deceived in the past to refuse to go to the classes under the pretext of "self-education." Some teachers, due to the influence of old social habits, did not understand new things, disliked the revolutionary actions of the young revolutionaries, easily accepted the inducements of some people with ulterior motives, did not go to the classes to study, and were unwilling to go to the classes to teach. On the other hand, they took advantage of the influence of anarchism on students, inciting students to go out to link up. Thus, the first attempt to establish specialized platoons encountered a setback.

	To Carry Out a Thorough Revolution, Not Reform

	Should we advance or retreat? Should we insist on resuming classes and making revolution, or give up halfway?

	At this difficult moment, the revolutionary teachers and students eagerly studied Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive." They discussed Chairman Mao's teachings time and time again: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts illuminated their path forward. They unanimously expressed: Follow Chairman Mao closely and achieve a great victory in the proletarian educational revolution!

	Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the college, they closely combined revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation within the unit, thoroughly exposing the plots and crimes of a small clique of capitalist roaders within the college and a few reactionary academic "authorities" to sabotage struggle-criticism-transformation and resume classes and make revolution. Through study and criticism, revolutionary teachers and students clarified two issues and understood two truths. "Two issues" are: clarifying who is sabotaging the resumption of classes and making revolution and who is insisting on the resumption of classes and making revolution; clarifying whether abolishing the teaching and research sections and establishing specialized platoons is beneficial to the resumption of classes and making revolution, or not abolishing them is beneficial. "Two truths" are: understanding that a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and a few reactionary academic "authorities" are the real saboteurs of the resumption of classes and making revolution; understanding that the teaching and research sections are not only important tools for promoting the revisionist educational line but also obstacles to educational revolution.

	Through this revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary "three-in-one" combination of the college were further consolidated and developed. In a good situation, on October 16th, the revolutionary committee of the college made a formal decision: abolish the teaching and research sections and organize "three-in-one" specialized platoons by profession to lead teaching and educational reform.

	However, a small clique of capitalist roaders within the party and a few reactionary academic "authorities" were extremely terrified. They helplessly said: "Good! If you want to do 'three-in-one,' let the student representatives participate in the teaching and research sections!" This is an old trick, which has been done before. Student representatives participating in the teaching and research sections can only be "decorations," and the actual power is still in their hands. Therefore, the proletarian revolutionary faction said bluntly: "We want a thorough revolution, not reform!"

	Then, they played the dirty trick of "transmitting knowledge," attempting to turn a serious educational revolution into a simple "textbook revolution." They said: "Revise the textbooks a bit, start classes quickly, and learn some knowledge!" These words also had some market. Some students viewed the educational revolution from the perspective of prioritizing professional skills, only satisfied with the reform of teaching methods and content, and ignored the fundamental task of the educational revolution. However, under the leadership of the revolutionary committee of the college, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions on educational revolution, "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," and other works, gradually realizing: the fundamental task of the educational revolution is to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, establish Chairman Mao's educational line, and cultivate successors for the proletarian revolutionary cause. They said: "We do not want reform. We want to completely eliminate the entire old educational system!"

	Revolutionary students no longer believe in any bourgeois "authorities" or "profound knowledge." They invited workers with rich practical experience to be teachers. They said: "We want to learn from workers and peasants, and we want to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao. No one can stop us!"

	× × ×

	The establishment of specialized platoons in Beijing Forestry College is only the beginning of the educational revolution's ten-thousand-li long march. The road ahead is still long, and the tasks are still very arduous. Whether the organizational form of the specialized platoons is completely suitable for teaching, production, and scientific research, how to consolidate and improve the organizational form of the specialized platoons politically and ideologically, and a series of other problems still need to be further solved and verified in practice. Moreover, there will inevitably be struggles in this process, and there may even be setbacks.

	However, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Forestry College are determined to be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and red pioneers of the educational revolution. They will raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and advance bravely through struggle.

    教育革命尖兵在斗争中前进
    ——记北京林学院教育改革方案产生过程
    编者按：毛主席教导我们：“正确的东西总是在同错误的东西作斗争的过程中发展起来的。”北京林学院撤销教研室，成立专业连队的经过，充分说明了这一真理。
    无产阶级教育革命，是完全崭新的事业。它每前进一步，都要经过斗争。建立专业连队的倡议，早在一九五八年就提出来了。可是，一开始就遭到了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人所推行的修正主义教育路线的抵制和破坏，而且使这场斗争一直延续了八、九年。
    但是，在毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的指引下，新生事物的生命力是无比强大的。北京林学院的革命师生员工，经过艰苦的斗争，终于取得了胜利。
    专业连队建立了，斗争并没有结束，还要通过反复的实践和斗争，一步步巩固和扩大胜利。
    现在，大中小学都在复课闹革命，都要集中力量进行革命大批判和本单位斗批改。因为只有彻底批判修正主义教育路线，彻底破除旧的教育制度，才能贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，才能创立崭新的无产阶级教育制度。在必要的情况下，也可以有组织、有计划、有领导地派出少量人员，深入到当地的工农群众中去调查研究，来充实教学改革的内容。
    北京林学院的教改方案发表后，各地的革命师生纷纷问道：“你们为什么要取消教研室，建立专业连队呢？你们的道路是怎样走过来的呢？”
    北京林学院走过的道路，是一条斗争的道路。
    革命斗争历史的启示
    历史的巨轮滚滚向前，教育战线上的阶级斗争从未间断过。翻开北京林学院十五年来的历史，哪一页不是阶级斗争的历史？！
    十多年来，北京林学院党内一小撮走资派以及在他们包庇下的少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”，互相勾结，打着“专家办学，教授治校”的招牌，把学校的领导权控制在自己手里，排挤党的领导，打击党的领导干部。特别是他们把持的教研室，掌握了制订教学大纲、审编教材课本、决定教学内容方法等一系列的教学大权，成了他们推行修正主义教育路线的重要工具，也是他们用以抵制和对抗毛主席教育路线的顽固堡垒。
    毛主席教导我们：“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”。而他们却利用自己掌握的领导权和阵地，大量向革命青年灌输资产阶级和修正主义的毒素，培养资产阶级接班人。许多学生进校以后，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心专读圣贤书”，几年之间，由于严重脱离实际，脱离政治，不但中毒日深，而且思想僵化，身心健康都受到严重摧残。
    十多年来，北京林学院的革命师生在毛泽东思想指导下，对修正主义教育路线、教研室制度，曾经进行多次的冲击。一九五八年，林学院革命师生发扬大无畏的革命精神，深入贯彻执行毛主席教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，冲破教研室制度的束缚，按民兵组织编成连队，走向工厂、林区，开展革命学生、革命教师和生产能手“三结合”的“综合劳动教学”。各教研室配合起来，专业课和基础课联系起来，形成一条龙的教学方法。但是，这一新生的事物，却被党内一小撮走资派以“稳定教学秩序”为借口扼杀了。
    一九六○年，在反右倾斗争胜利的基础上，北京林学院的革命师生再一次起来批判资产阶级，改革旧的教学内容和教学方法。在系里，实行党总支领导制，在教研室，由教研室主任、教师、学生组成“三结合”领导班子，领导教改。但是一九六一年，教育战线上刮起了一股妖风，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，向毛主席的教育路线发动了疯狂进攻。林学院党内一小撮走资派秉承其主子的意旨，在“一切为了教学”的幌子下，独揽一切大权，把一切教改成果砍光。一九六四年春节，毛主席又作了关于教育革命的指示，但是他们按兵不动，顽固地进行抵抗。
    为什么毛主席的教育路线不能在这里很好地实行？经过几年来阶级斗争的锻炼、特别是文化大革命的实践，北京林学院的革命师生员工清楚地看到：就是因为中国赫鲁晓夫推行一条反革命的修正主义教育路线。他们深有感受地说：“不破除修正主义教育路线，就不能确立毛主席的教育路线；不破坏旧的制度，就不能创立新的制度。”
    从斗争中学习斗争
    在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，林学院的无产阶级革命派，高举“造反有理”的革命大旗，夺了学院党内一小撮走资派的领导权。但是，斗争并没有完结。
    六月间，毛主席、党中央发出了“复课闹革命”的战斗号召，北京林学院的无产阶级革命派闻风而动。
    复课闹革命是一项新的课题，到底如何搞？有人说：“复课怎么复，现在还没谱。还是等一等再说吧！”
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”林学院的无产阶级革命派，没有等待，而是遵照毛主席的指示，充分发动群众，大胆实践，大胆创造。
    东方红公社八一八战斗队、五四战斗队、遵义战斗队等战斗组织，首先贴出大字报：
    请老师立即走出教研室，到我们中间来，和我们一起组织专业连队，把我院一斗二批三改的任务进行到底……
    广大革命师生坚决支持这张革命的大字报。许多革命的教师下班级了，受到革命同学的热烈欢迎。
    这一革命的行动，吓坏了党内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”。他们从阴暗的角落里钻了出来，散布流言蜚语：“这是想把教师吞并了！”“这是拉一派打一派！”他们以此笼络人心，收买群众，妄图破坏复课闹革命。他们首先挑动一些过去因为受蒙蔽犯了错误的干部和教师，以“自己教育自己”为名，拒绝下班级。教师中有一些人，由于受到旧的社会习惯势力的影响，对新生事物不理解，对革命小将的革命行动看不惯，轻易地接受了某些别有用心的人的引诱，不到班上学习，不愿意到班上上课。另一方面，他们利用学生受无政府主义的影响，煽动学生外出串连。这样，建立专业连队的第一次尝试受到了挫折。
    要彻底革命，不要改良
    到底是前进，还是后退？是坚持复课闹革命，还是半途而废？
    在这困难的时刻，革命师生如饥似渴地学习毛主席的“五·七”指示。他们一次又一次地讨论毛主席的教导：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的光辉思想照亮了他们前进的道路。他们一致表示：紧跟毛主席，夺取无产阶级教育革命的伟大胜利！
    他们在院革委会的领导下，把革命的大批判和本单位斗批改紧紧结合起来，充分揭发院党内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”破坏斗批改和复课闹革命的阴谋和罪行。通过学习、批判，革命师生弄清两个问题，明白了两个道理。“两个问题”是：弄清了谁在破坏复课闹革命，谁在坚持复课闹革命；弄清了是取消教研室建立专业连队有利于复课闹革命，还是不取消有利于复课闹革命。“两个道理”是：明白了党内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”是复课闹革命的真正破坏者；明白了教研室不但是推行修正主义教育路线的重要工具，而且是教育革命的障碍物。
    通过这次革命的大批判，学院的革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，得到进一步巩固和发展。在一片大好形势下，十月十六日，院革委会作出正式决定：取消教研室，按专业组织“三结合”的专业连队，领导教学和教改。
    可是，党内一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”，却无比恐慌。他们无可奈何地说：“好呀！要搞‘三结合’，你们学生派代表参加到教研室来吧！”这是老调重弹，以前曾经这样做过，学生代表参加教研室，只能当“陪衬”，实际权力仍掌握在他们手里。所以，无产阶级革命派直截了当地说：“我们要彻底革命，不要改良！”
    接着，他们又打出“传授知识”的臭招牌，企图把一场严肃的教育革命，引入单纯的“课本革命”。他们说：“把课本修改一下，快点上课，学点知识要紧呀！”
    这些话也有一些市场。有的同学以业务挂帅的观点看待教育革命，只满足于教学方法、教学内容方面的改革，而忽视教育革命的根本任务。但是，他们在院革委会的领导下，学习毛主席关于教育革命的指示、《将革命进行到底》等著作，逐渐明白过来：教育革命的根本任务，就是彻底批判修正主义教育路线，确立毛主席的教育路线，为无产阶级革命事业培养接班人。他们说：“我们不要改良，我们要把整个旧教育制度彻底破除！”
    革命的学生再也不相信什么资产阶级“权威”，什么“高深的学问”。他们请有丰富实践经验的工人当教员。他们说：“我们就是要拜工农为师，就是要走毛主席指引的道路，谁也阻挡不了！”
              ×　　×　　×
    北京林学院专业连队的建立，只是教育革命万里长征的开始，面前的路还很长，任务还非常艰巨。专业连队的组织形式是否完全适应教学、生产、科研的要求，怎样从政治上、思想上巩固和完善专业连队的组织等等一系列问题，还有待于进一步解决和在实践中去检验。而且，在这中间必然会有斗争，甚至可能出现反复。
    但是，北京林学院的革命师生员工们，决心做把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，做教育革命的红色尖兵，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中奋勇前进。　本报记者
