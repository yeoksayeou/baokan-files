	Chairman Mao's Quotations
	People of the whole world, unite! Defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! People of the whole world, be brave and dare to fight, do not fear sacrifice, and advance wave upon wave. Then the whole world will belong to the people. All the reactionaries are paper tigers. Their end is foreseeable. They will be buried by the people of the world.
