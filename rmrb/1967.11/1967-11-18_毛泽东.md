We must properly address the issue of the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience.
