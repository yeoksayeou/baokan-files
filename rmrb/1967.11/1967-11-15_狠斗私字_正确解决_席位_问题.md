The revolutionary mass organizations of Qingdao Alkali Plant have recently achieved revolutionary great unity. However, when discussing the reinforcement of the factory-level leadership cadre, both sides had their own plans and proposed different schemes. The Workers and Peasants Division insisted that the new leadership cadre must include more of their members, otherwise it would lack sufficient representation. The Revolutionary Rebel Committee, which had been in power, firmly opposed this, saying, "Give you one member, and we won't feel secure; you want more!" "Our organization is large, and we have made great contributions during the Cultural Revolution. The power, of course, should be in our hands." Both sides argued back and forth, reaching a stalemate.

The stationed military comrades analyzed this issue and believed that both sides were arguing over the "seats" in the leadership cadre from a selfish perspective. If they continued to argue this way, the "seat" issue would never be resolved. Therefore, they must first struggle against selfishness. Thus, they helped the factory organize a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, the leaders and some members of both factions, with their active thoughts on the "seat" issue, studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They took the struggle against selfishness and revisionism as the key, focused on the "seat" issue, and conducted self-criticism, opening up the battlefield for self-examination and struggle against selfishness. The comrades from the Revolutionary Rebel Committee said, "Although our two factions have achieved revolutionary great unity, because the thought of 'unique revolution' is still in our minds, we always think that power should only be in our hands and do not consider the Workers and Peasants Division at all." The comrades from the Workers and Peasants Division said, "Our organization is small, and we are afraid that you will absorb us, so we insist that the committee members should be split equally. This way, we have power, the masses will listen to us, and we will not fall."

Through such open and sincere self-criticism, both sides unanimously recognized that Chairman Mao's teaching, "Internal sectarian tendencies produce exclusiveness, hindering the unity and solidarity within the Party," is an absolute truth that must be eradicated to eliminate the exclusiveness that hinders our unity.

Based on the struggle against selfishness, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee and the Workers and Peasants Division repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings on seizing power, resolving the issue of understanding "power." Chairman Mao taught us, "Communist Party members do not fight for individual military power (absolutely not, never learn from Zhang Guotao again), but fight for the Party's military power, fight for the people's military power." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, both sides examined their past mistakes in fighting for "seats," realizing that they were fighting for selfish interests and for small factions, not for the Party and the people. This kind of fighting for power is fundamentally against Mao Zedong Thought. Both sides finally reached a consensus: on the basis of revolutionary principles, they should be tolerant and accommodating, jointly hold and use power well.

During the study process, both factions focused on struggling against selfishness and revisionism. Once selfishness was overcome, the "seat" issue, which had been debated for a long time, was resolved. The comrades from the Workers and Peasants Division said, "The original leadership cadre has done a good job in holding power and adhering to the grand direction. We trust them, and we do not want any 'seats'." The comrades from the Revolutionary Rebel Committee proposed, "What 'seats'? After uniting, we are one family. There is no distinction between factions. We, the working class, should all be the Mao Zedong Thought faction." They also suggested, "Now, all levels of leadership need to be reinforced and strengthened. We should start from what is beneficial to the revolution and production, and absorb representatives from all sides to strengthen the leadership cadre."

Finally, both sides jointly decided: based on the original foundation, appropriately increase a few new members in the leadership cadre.

Now, the revolutionary great unity of Alkali Plant has been unprecedentedly consolidated and developed. In the Mao Zedong Thought study class, the harvest of struggling against selfishness and revisionism is great. The cadre issue has been quickly resolved. Revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres are working together to seize the revolution and promote production.

    狠斗私字  正确解决“席位”问题
    青岛泡花碱厂革命群众组织负责人认真作自我批评，巩固了革命大联合
    本报讯青岛市泡花碱厂两派革命群众组织，不久前实现了革命大联合。但在讨论充实厂级领导班子时，各有各的打算，分别提出了不同的方案。工农分部提出，新领导班子里一定要增加他们的名额，否则没有充分的代表性。原来掌权的革命造反委员会，坚决不同意，说：“给你们一个委员，我们就很不放心了，还想多要！”“我们组织大，在文化大革命中立下了汗马功劳，权，当然应该由我们来掌。”双方争来争去，相持不下。
    驻厂解放军同志对这个问题进行了分析，认为双方争领导班子中的“席位”，都是从“私”字出发。这样争下去，
  “席位”问题永远也不能解决。因此，必须首先狠斗“私”字。于是帮助工厂举办了毛泽东思想学习班。
    在毛泽东思想学习班里，两派组织的负责人和部分队员，带着争“席位”的活思想，学习毛主席的“老三篇”、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等文章。他们以斗私批修为纲，抓住“席位”问题，进行自我批评，摆开了挖私、斗私的战场。革造会的同志们说：“我们两派虽然实现了革命大联合，因为我们脑子里的‘唯我独革’的思想在打转，总认为大权只能由我来独揽，根本没把工农分部放在眼里。”工农分部的同志们说：“我们的组织小，怕你们吃掉，所以，坚持委员会的委员要一家一半。这样，我们有了权，群众就听我们的，我们就垮不了。”经过这样开诚布公、推心置腹的自我批评，双方一致认识到，毛主席教导的“对内的宗派主义倾向产生排内性，妨碍党内的统一和团结”，是千真万确的真理，必须铲除妨碍我们团结的“排内性”。
    革造会和工农分部在狠斗“私”字的基础上，又反复学习了毛主席关于夺权的论述，解决了对“权”的认识问题。毛主席教导我们：“共产党员不争个人的兵权（决不能争，再也不要学张国焘），但要争党的兵权，要争人民的兵权。”根据毛主席的教导，双方都检查了以前争夺“席位”的错误，是为“私”争权，为小山头争权，不是为党争权和为人民争权，是革命派内部的争权，不是革命派从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权。所以，这种争权是根本违背毛泽东思想的。双方最后统一了认识：在革命的原则基础上，互谅互让，共同掌好权，用好权。
    两派在学习过程中，狠抓斗私批修，“私”字斗倒了，
  一度争论不休的“席位”问题，也就迎刃而解。工农分部的同志们表示：“原来的领导班子掌权掌得好，能坚持大方向，我们信得过，‘席位’我们一个也不要了。”革造会的同志们提出：“什么‘席位’不‘席位’，联合起来，我们已经是一家人了，再也不分什么派，我们工人阶级都应当是毛泽东思想派。”他们还建议：“现在，各级领导都需要充实、加强，应当从有利于革命和生产出发，吸收各方面的代表来加强领导班子。”最后，双方共同商量，作出决定：领导班子在原有基础上，再适当增加若干新成员。
    现在，泡花碱厂革命大联合得到了空前巩固和发展。在毛泽东思想学习班里，斗私批修的收获很大。干部问题迅速得到解决，革命工人和革命干部齐心协力抓革命，促生产。
