Editor's Note: The article "Warmly Support Revolutionary New Cadres" from *Wen Hui Bao* raises an important issue in the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deserves attention from comrades.

Chairman Mao has instructed us in his latest directives: "We must properly address the issue of relationships between superiors and subordinates, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and adhere to the mass line. They should consult with the masses on all matters and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." We hope that all revolutionary cadres, both new and old, will resolutely implement Chairman Mao's extremely important directive in the current favorable situation. We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly practice the mass line, and take "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the key task. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and fight to complete the great historical task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Warmly Support Revolutionary New Cadres

*Wen Hui Bao* Editorial, November 10

The surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought a large number of revolutionary "little people" to the forefront of the revolutionary leadership, entering the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and a fruitful achievement of the Cultural Revolution.

Systematically cultivating a large number of revolutionary new cadres, constantly injecting new blood into the revolutionary leadership teams, is Chairman Mao's great strategic thought for training and fostering millions of successors to the cause of proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "If our party does not have a large number of new cadres working together with old cadres, our cause will be interrupted." Therefore, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, establishing the revolutionary three-in-one leadership teams not only means implementing the three-in-one combination of revolutionary masses, the People's Liberation Army, and revolutionary cadres, but also means combining the old, middle-aged, and young. If we do this well, our revolutionary leadership teams will constantly be infused with new revolutionary forces, full of fighting vigor.

We must wholeheartedly support and help the newly emerged revolutionary cadres. New cadres are a new revolutionary shock force. Due to their lack of experience, they may not immediately adapt to the current needs of the struggle in some aspects. However, through the practice of struggle, they will quickly develop their abilities and overcome their weaknesses. If we do not distinguish between the main and secondary aspects and harbor doubts about the revolutionary new forces, pick faults, and ridicule the young shoots for being weak, we will make a directional mistake. The result, as Lenin pointed out, "is actually a means of class struggle by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat, protecting capitalism and opposing socialism." This is something we must be especially vigilant about.

In the temporary power organs of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, revolutionary old cadres must correctly treat revolutionary new cadres. They must have proletarian feelings and a sense of revolutionary responsibility, and wholeheartedly use correct revolutionary principles to educate new cadres. They must use their own battle experiences, especially their own mistakes, to educate new cadres, and demand political maturity from them. Together with new cadres, they must exercise power well and use power well. They must not coldly observe new cadres or laugh at them. They must not flatter new cadres, engage in unprincipled flattery, or practice bourgeois vulgarities. Currently, sugar-coated bullets are often an important means for the bourgeoisie to destroy new cadres. Revolutionary comrades must be vigilant against this.

To properly handle the relationship between new and old revolutionary cadres, we must advocate a spirit of mutual learning and complementing each other's strengths. Whether new or old revolutionary cadres, they must learn from each other's strengths. Revolutionary new cadres should respect revolutionary old cadres and regard the strengths of revolutionary old cadres as valuable treasures. Revolutionary old cadres should also sincerely learn from the new generation. In this way, our cadre team will definitely thrive. As for the handful of traitors, spies, diehard capitalist-roaders within the party, and the ghosts and snakes in society (those landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed), we must not allow them to infiltrate the cadre team.

New and old revolutionary cadres must trust each other and cooperate with each other. Any gaps between some new and old revolutionary cadres must be eliminated through "struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism," studying Chairman Mao's works, conducting heart-to-heart talks, and eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. New and old revolutionary cadres must unite and fight shoulder to shoulder in the current struggle.

Supporting and helping revolutionary new cadres is a major issue in consolidating the revolutionary three-in-one combination. We revolutionary old cadres and our broad revolutionary masses must share the heavy burdens of revolution and production with revolutionary new cadres, foil the evil schemes of the class enemy to sow discord between new and old revolutionary cadres, and fight to consolidate the proletarian revolutionary power.

### 要热情地支持革命的新干部  《文汇报》十一月十日社论

专栏：

    编者按：文汇报《要热情地支持革命的新干部》一文，提出了当前无产阶级文化大革命中的一个重要问题，希望引起同志们的注意。
    毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”希望广大新、老革命干部，在当前大好形势下，都要坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的这个极其重要的指示，更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，认真实行群众路线，以“斗私，批修”为纲，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，为完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大历史任务而斗争。
    要热情地支持革命的新干部
    《文汇报》十一月十日社论
    无产阶级文化大革命的激流，把一大批革命的“小人物”推上了革命的领导岗位，进入了革命三结合的领导班子。这是毛主席的革命路线的一个伟大胜利，是文化大革命的丰硕成果。
    有计划地培养大批革命的新干部，在革命的领导班子中不断地充实新的血液，这是毛主席的培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的伟大战略思想。毛主席教导我们：“我们党如果没有广大的新干部同老干部一致合作，我们的事业就会中断。”所以，在无产阶级文化大革命中建立革命三结合，不仅要实行革命群众、人民解放军和革命干部的革命三结合，还要实行老年人、中年人和青年人的结合。这一点做好了，我们的革命领导班子就会不断得到革命新生力量的充实，充满着战斗的活力。
    对于新成长起来的革命干部，我们必须满腔热诚地支持他们，帮助他们。新干部是一支新生的革命突击队，他们由于缺乏斗争经验，可能在某些方面不能一下子就适应当前斗争的需要。但是，在斗争的实践中他们会迅速地增长才干，克服自己的弱点。如果我们不分主流和支流，对革命的新生力量抱着怀疑态度，挑剔责难，讥笑新的幼芽软弱，那就会犯方向的错误。其结果，正如列宁所指出：“这一切实际上是资产阶级反对无产阶级的阶级斗争手段，是保护资本主义而反对社会主义。”这是值得特别警惕的。
    在革命三结合的临时权力机构中，革命的老干部一定要正确对待革命的新干部。要满怀无产阶级的感情和革命的责任感，满腔热情地用正确的革命原则教育新干部，用自己的战斗经历，特别是自己犯错误的教训去教育新干部，从政治上严格要求新干部，帮助他们从政治上更快地成熟起来，与新干部一起掌好权、用好权。决不能对新干部冷眼旁观，看笑话。更不能对新干部吹吹捧捧，搞无原则的讨好捧场，搞资产阶级庸俗的一套。在当前糖衣炮弹往往是资产阶级毁灭新干部的重要手段。革命的同志对此务必保持警惕。
    正确处理好新老革命干部的关系，就要提倡相互学习，取长补短的革命精神。无论是革命的新干部，无论是革命的老干部，都要多看别人的长处。革命新干部应当尊重革命老干部，把革命的老干部的长处，作为宝贵的财富接受过来。革命的老干部也应当诚心诚意地向革命的新一代学习。这样，我们的干部队伍就一定能兴旺起来。至于那一小撮叛徒、特务、顽固不化的党内走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神（即没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右），决不允许他们混进革命干部队伍中来。
    新老革命干部要相互信任，彼此合作。在某些新老革命干部之间存在的种种隔阂，要在“斗私，批修”中，通过学习毛主席著作，开展谈心活动，破私立公，加以消除。新老革命干部要在当前的斗争中，进一步团结起来，并肩战斗。
    支持革命的新干部，帮助革命的新干部，是巩固革命三结合的一个重大问题。我们革命的老干部，我们的广大革命群众，都应当和革命的新干部共同挑好革命和生产两副重担，粉碎阶级敌人挑拨新老革命干部关系的罪恶阴谋，为巩固无产阶级的革命的政权而斗争。　（本报转载时略有修改）
