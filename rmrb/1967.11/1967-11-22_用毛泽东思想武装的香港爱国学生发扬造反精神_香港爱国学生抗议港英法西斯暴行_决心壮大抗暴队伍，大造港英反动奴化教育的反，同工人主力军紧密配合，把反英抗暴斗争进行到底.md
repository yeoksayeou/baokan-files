Hong Kong patriotic students, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the spirit of rebellion. Hong Kong patriotic students protest against the fascist atrocities of the British. They are determined to strengthen the anti-violence forces, to strongly oppose the British reactionary slave-education system, to closely cooperate with the workers' main force, and to carry the anti-British, anti-violence struggle through to the end.

	Hong Kong, November 21 (Xinhua) - On the 19th, patriotic students from various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon held rallies and demonstrations to strongly condemn the fascist atrocities committed by British imperialism against patriotic students.

	On the morning of the 19th, more than 1,500 patriotic students and workers from various schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a "Rally to Protest Against British Persecution of Patriotic Students." The students strongly condemned the recent escalation of fascist persecution by the British authorities against patriotic students. They pointed out that after the British authorities illegally abducted 53 patriotic teachers and students from Heung Yee Middle School and arbitrarily arrested more than a dozen patriotic students from "Government" Queen's College and Pui Ching Middle School, they are currently continuing to intensify the suppression of the increasingly vibrant patriotic student movement, attempting to extinguish this flame of anti-British, anti-violence struggle. However, patriotic students armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought are not afraid and cannot be crushed. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao's consistent teachings, further mobilize the masses, continuously strengthen the patriotic student anti-violence forces, strongly oppose the British imperialist reactionary slave-education system, and closely unite with the workers' main force to swear to carry the anti-British, anti-violence struggle through to the end.

	Many patriotic students from schools controlled by the British, Americans, and the KMT strongly denounced the British political persecution and the poisonous effects of slave-education on the rally. They resolutely declared: We can no longer allow British imperialism to make us its slaves and obedient subjects. We can no longer be silent about British imperialism's national oppression. We want to be new youth of the Mao Zedong era, bravely joining the anti-British, anti-violence struggle.

	Workers in their speeches highly praised the patriotic students' daring spirit of rebellion and struggle, and expressed their resolute support for the patriotic and just actions of the students in opposing slave-education and British persecution.

	In the afternoon of the 19th, nearly a thousand patriotic students from various schools and schools controlled by the British, Americans, and the KMT held a demonstration march in the commercial center of Kowloon, Mong Kok. They broke through the strict surveillance of British secret agents, holding up a large red banner reading "Protest Against British Persecution of Patriotic Students," marching forward with high spirits and fighting spirit. They sang revolutionary songs while distributing anti-British, anti-violence leaflets to nearby compatriots. Slogans such as "Strongly Protest Against British Fascist Persecution!", "Down with British Imperialism!", "Thoroughly Smash Slave-Education!", "Long Live the Invincible Mao Zedong Thought!", and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" echoed throughout Mong Kok.

	More than 200 patriotic students and workers in the New Territories also held a rally in the afternoon of the 19th to strongly protest against the British fascist atrocities against patriotic students.

    工人们在讲话中热烈赞扬爱国学生敢于造反，敢于斗争的大无畏精神，并且表示坚决支持爱国学生反对奴化教育、反对港英迫害的爱国正义行动。
    十九日下午，近千名爱国学校和英、美、蒋帮控制的学校的学生，在九龙商业中心区旺角区举行示威游行。他们冲破港英特务的严密监视，高举“抗议港英迫害爱国学生”的巨大红色横幅，意气风发、斗志昂扬地行进。他们一面高唱革命歌曲，一面向附近的同胞散发反英抗暴传单。“强烈抗议港英法西斯迫害！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“彻底粉碎奴化教育！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”等口号声震撼了整个旺角区。
