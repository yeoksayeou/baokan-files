    A new atmosphere of unity and vitality prevails at the Hangzhou Vehicle Depot. After achieving revolutionary unity, the workers collectively study Chairman Mao's works and engage in revolutionary criticism. Everyone eagerly participates in speeches, and each person strives to write critical articles. If a comrade has a knot in their thoughts, everyone helps; if there is a problem in a production link, everyone works to solve it.

    According to Xinhua News Agency in Hangzhou, the Hangzhou Vehicle Depot of the railway department is one of the earliest units in Hangzhou to achieve revolutionary unity by workshop and team. A vibrant atmosphere of unity has emerged, strongly promoting the development of revolutionary criticism and production.

    This depot has nearly a thousand workers and is responsible for the heavy task of vehicle maintenance. In July of this year, the proletarian revolutionary factions had already gained the upper hand politically and organizationally. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations and the revolutionary masses felt that the cross-class organizational form was increasingly not suited to the needs of the revolution and production. With the help of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the depot, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings on "everything for the victory of the front line, organizational tasks must serve political tasks," studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas within the Party" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and fought hard against the "self" in their minds, overcoming sectarianism and the erroneous idea of "me as the center." Through thorough consultation, they achieved revolutionary unity by workshop and team, improved and developed the unified revolutionary mass organization of the vehicle depot, selected new leadership teams for each workshop and team, and established a new revolutionary order.

    After achieving revolutionary unity by workshop and team, each team extensively launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary masses also visited families and had individual heart-to-heart talks, enthusiastically helping those who were deceived to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, studying Chairman Mao's works together, and jointly conducting revolutionary criticism. At the criticism meetings, everyone eagerly participated in speeches, published columns on criticism, and each person strove to write critical articles. Through revolutionary criticism, the ideological revolution of the workers was greatly promoted, deepening mutual understanding among comrades and enhancing revolutionary feelings. Now, if a comrade has a knot in their thoughts, everyone helps; if there is a problem in a production link, everyone works to solve it. The entire vehicle depot has presented a new situation of unity and vitality. From July to September, the entire depot completed the production tasks ahead of schedule every month.

    After Chairman Mao's latest instructions were issued, this depot responded promptly, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, using "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism" as the guideline, making Mao Zedong Thought truly the soul of revolutionary unity, and further consolidating and developing revolutionary unity.

    杭州车辆段一片团结活泼新气象  
    这个单位实现革命大联合后，职工群众共同学习毛主席著作，共同进行革命大批判。人人争先发言，个个争写批判文章。班组里一个同志思想有疙瘩，大家进行帮助；一个生产环节有问题，大家设法解决。
    据新华社杭州电　杭州市最早按车间、班组实现革命大联合的单位之一——铁路部门的杭州车辆段，出现了团结、活泼的新气象，有力地促进了革命大批判和生产的蓬勃发展。
    这个车辆段有近千名工人，担负着繁重的车辆检修任务。今年七月，车辆段的无产阶级革命派在政治上、组织上都已占优势，革命群众组织的负责人和革命群众感到跨班的组织形式越来越不适应革命和生产的需要，他们在驻段支左的人民解放军的帮助下，遵照毛主席关于“一切为了前线的胜利，组织任务须服从于政治任务”的教导，学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，克服了山头主义和“以我为核心”等错误思想，经过充分协商，按车间、班组实现了革命的大联合，健全和发展了车辆段统一的革命群众组织，各车间各班组都选出了新的领导班子，建立了革命新秩序。
    按车间、班组实现革命大联合后，各班组广泛地掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。革命群众还通过家庭访问、个别谈心，热情帮助受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来，共同学习毛主席著作，共同搞革命的大批判。在批判会上，人人争先发言，出大批判专栏，个个争写批判文章。通过革命的大批判，大大促进了职工群众的思想革命化，加深了同志之间的相互了解，增进了革命感情。现在班组里一个同志思想有疙瘩，大家进行帮助；一个生产环节有问题，大家设法解决，整个车辆段出现了团结、活泼的新局面。从七月到九月份，全段月月提前完成生产任务。
    毛主席的最新指示下达后，这个车辆段闻风而动，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，使毛泽东思想真正成为革命大联合的灵魂，进一步巩固和发展了革命的大联合。
