The Albanian people have warmly welcomed the publication of the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations. They have enthusiastically embraced this red revolutionary treasure, eagerly reading and discussing it.

The first secretary of the Berat District Committee of the Party of Labor, Karafili, said, "The publication of the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations is a precious gift from the brotherly Chinese people to our party and our people. This book of great significance and immense value once again demonstrates the fighting ties and fraternal friendship between our two countries, our two peoples, and our two Marxist-Leninist parties. Our working people can learn from Chairman Mao's Quotations about the revolutionary path of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and about Chairman Mao's great teachings and thoughts. This book, like the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, will help in the Marxist-Leninist education of cadres and the masses."

The first secretary of the Saranda District Committee of the Party of Labor, Labo, said, "The publication of the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations has increased our love for the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Comrade Mao Zedong is the successor of the cause of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. We must study and apply Mao Zedong Thought well."

The chairman of the Berat People's Council Executive Committee, Charchani, said, "Chairman Mao's Quotations are our spiritual food and source of inspiration, a precious gift to the Albanian people and all the people of the world. We must study and master it well."

A cadre of the Party of Labor in Tirana, Luarasi, said, "The red Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations is a further enrichment and development of Marxist-Leninist theory by the great leader, great Marxist-Leninist, and dearest friend of our people, Comrade Mao Zedong. The thoughts and works of Comrade Mao Zedong guide the great Chinese people from victory to victory, turning People's China into an unshakable bastion of world socialism. The thoughts and works of Chairman Mao guide the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to advance in great strides, sweeping away with irresistible force all the mud and filth of revisionism and the bourgeoisie, and opening up a brilliant prospect for the construction of socialism and communism in China. The Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations is a very precious document for the Marxist-Leninist education of the entire people of Albania and the cadres of the party. The red Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations is an important document for tempering our thoughts. It is another compass for us to fulfill the great tasks assigned to us by the party. We will study Chairman Mao's Quotations and other works of Chairman Mao with great enthusiasm and spread Chairman Mao's thoughts among the masses."

The first secretary of the Saranda District Committee of the Labor Youth League, Kiraliko, said, "The young people in our district have been eagerly awaiting the publication of the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations. The young people often ask us when this book will be published. Now that the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations has been published, this is the greatest news. We are studying Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle. Because our district is surrounded by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, this teaching is very helpful to us."

The red revolutionary treasure has reached the workers, who have welcomed it with great enthusiasm. Indezha, a model worker and secretary of the Labor Youth League branch at the Mao Zedong Textile Factory, said, "The workers in our factory are very happy to hear that the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations has been published. Like other works of Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's Quotations will be forever engraved in our hearts. It will help our Marxist-Leninist education and make us better understand the rich experience of the glorious Chinese Communist Party." Nanu, a worker at the "Enver" Mechanical Factory in Tirana and a member of the Party of Labor, said, "We must study this book. Because it is the same as other classic works of Marxism-Leninism and the works of Comrade Hoxha, it will nourish us with new strength and revolutionary blood. By studying these works seriously, we can raise our class consciousness, sharpen our political sensitivity, and become worthy shock troops."

The red revolutionary treasure has reached the farmers in agricultural cooperatives, who have welcomed it with joy. Bechiraj, the secretary of the Party branch at the "New China" Agricultural Cooperative in Tirana, said, "The news of the publication of the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations has made us overjoyed. We have the Albanian version of the Selected Works of Mao Zedong, and now we will have the red book Chairman Mao's Quotations. We will always keep the works of Chairman Mao, as well as other classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the documents of the Party of Labor of Albania, and the works of Comrade Hoxha, with us, and study them seriously, keeping them with our guns. Chairman Mao's red book has frightened the revisionists. Because they know that if every honest person gets this book and studies it seriously, they will have to settle accounts with them and clean up their mess. For us, Chairman Mao's Quotations and other classic works of Marxism-Leninism, the documents of the Party of Labor of Albania, and the works of Comrade Hoxha will become our ideological weapons for building socialism and fighting against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. They will build an impregnable ideological Great Wall, making all thoughts that are incompatible with Marxism-Leninism, bourgeois thoughts, and revisionist thoughts suffer a crushing defeat." Demaj, the chairman of the "Albania-China Friendship" Agricultural Cooperative in Saranda, said happily after receiving Chairman Mao's Quotations, "Chairman Mao's teachings are a beacon for all the people of the world."

The broad masses of students have also warmly welcomed the Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations. Dobrusi, a student at the University of Tirana, said, "In the midst of rampant revisionism in Europe, socialist Albania is a beacon spreading the great truth of Marxism-Leninism. The Albanian version of Chairman Mao's Quotations has great theoretical value. We must study it well."
