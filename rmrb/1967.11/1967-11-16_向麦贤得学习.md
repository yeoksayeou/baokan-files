Mai Xiande's heroic deeds are a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. Mai Xiande is a shining example of upholding the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and applying Chairman Mao's works actively and effectively.

Mai Xiande has boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for our great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought. He actively responded to the call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." He treats studying Chairman Mao's works as his first necessity in life and regards the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought as the sunshine and rain that sustain his life. He follows Chairman Mao's words to the letter and the spirit. His highest revolutionary ideal, his most steadfast proletarian stand, his deepest class feelings, and his greatest courage and wisdom all stem from his active and effective study of Chairman Mao's works and his diligent self-transformation.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mai Xiande's heart beats in unison with the hearts of the revolutionary masses across the nation. He harbors deep class bitterness and hatred, pouring all his resentment onto Liu Shaoqi, the Chinese Khrushchev, and the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. During the movement, he closely follows Chairman Mao, closely follows Mao Zedong Thought, and closely follows Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. He loves and supports those who support Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and he hates and resolutely fights against those who oppose Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao said: "We should be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the Chinese people...." Mai Xiande takes this instruction from Chairman Mao as his guiding principle. He strictly demands of himself and thoroughly eliminates selfishness and establishes public-mindedness. In Mai Xiande's heart, there is no room for personal gain, not even a little; for public good, there is always more to do, a lifetime is not enough. He attributes all his honors and achievements to the great leader Chairman Mao and to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Mai Xiande's lofty qualities of thoroughly eliminating selfishness and wholeheartedly serving the public shine with the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought, revealing the spiritual realm of a new generation of communists. This is in stark contrast to those who become arrogant and complacent after achieving a little, those who love to show off and flaunt their talents, and those who always put "I" first in everything. Mai Xiande is a sincere and loyal follower of Chairman Mao.

We should learn from Mai Xiande by being unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We should strive to actively and effectively study Chairman Mao's works, focusing on the "application" aspect. We should fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, allowing Mao Zedong Thought to take root in our minds and firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

    向麦贤得学习
    《人民日报》、《解放军报》评论员
    麦贤得的英雄事迹，是一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。麦贤得是大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威、活学活用毛主席著作的光辉榜样。
    麦贤得对我们伟大的领袖毛主席，对光焰无际的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。他积极响应林彪副主席的号召：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”他把学习毛主席著作当作自己生活的第一需要，把光辉的毛泽东思想当作自己生存的阳光和雨露。对毛主席的话，他字字照办，句句照办。他的最崇高的革命理想，最坚定的无产阶级立场，最深厚的阶级感情，最大的勇敢和智慧，来源于他活学活用毛主席著作，是他刻苦地进行思想改造的结果。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，麦贤得的心，和全国无产阶级革命派紧紧地连在一起。他带着阶级苦，血泪仇，把全部的仇恨都倾泻到中国赫鲁晓夫身上，倾泻到党内一小撮走资派身上。运动中，他紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。谁拥护毛主席，拥护毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他就爱谁，支持谁；谁反对毛主席，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他就恨谁，就向他作坚决斗争。
    毛主席说：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……”。麦贤得把毛主席的这个指示，当作座右铭。严格要求自己，彻底地破私立公。在麦贤得心中，为私的事，一点也不要，半点也不要；为公的事，永远没有够，一辈子也不够。他把自己的一切荣誉和成绩，全部归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。麦贤得这种彻底斗私，一心为公的崇高品质，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，显示出了共产主义一代新人的精神境界。这和那些做了点事情，有了点成绩，就飘飘然、翘尾巴的人完全相反；和那种爱出风头，锋芒毕露的人完全相反；和那种事事、处处把“我”字放在前头的人完全相反。麦贤得是一个老老实实忠于毛主席的人。
    我们向麦贤得学习，就是要象他那样无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。要努力活学活用毛主席著作，在“用”字上狠下功夫，要斗私，批修，让毛泽东思想在头脑里扎根，牢固地树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
