U.S. Air Force Colonel John Peter Flynn, who was captured after infiltrating Hanoi, described his feelings during the invasion of North Vietnam to reporters: "My heart was pounding, and I was sweating." He said, "Young pilots in the U.S. military want to leave the Air Force to fly civilian planes," and "Old pilots like us just want to retire as soon as possible."

He mentioned that at the U.S. airbase in U-Tapao, Thailand, American commanders invited many priests to boost the morale of U.S. pilots. However, the pilots' morale remained extremely low. He said, "The U.S. war in Vietnam, like the previous war in Korea, is an unpopular war."

Among U.S. troops stationed in Western Europe, opposition to the U.S. war in Vietnam is growing. Reports indicate that over the past year, more than a thousand U.S. soldiers stationed in Western Europe have deserted, with 70% of them doing so due to their opposition to the Vietnam War.

Many deserters strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. According to the U.S. publication "National Guardian," a soldier named Rusty said he realized that "the U.S. is waging a dirty war in Vietnam." Another soldier named Joy said he deserted because he "opposes the imperialist policy of U.S. intervention in the revolutions of other peoples in Vietnam and elsewhere."

The U.S. aircraft carrier "Oriskany," which participated in the Vietnam War, docked at Yokosuka, Japan, on October 17. Four U.S. sailors took the opportunity to escape while on shore leave.

On the night of the 13th, these four U.S. sailors released a statement to the press through a Japanese organization, condemning the U.S. aggression in Vietnam as a "criminal act." The statement said, "We believe our actions are correct," and the purpose of this "action is to urge the American people to rise up" and oppose the war of aggression against Vietnam.

The Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam inflicted heavy casualties on U.S. aggressors in the Central Highlands. A wounded U.S. soldier was so frightened that he wailed in terror, presenting a pathetic sight. (Photo from Xinhua News Agency)

### 侵越战争不得人心  美军士气低落不堪

    侵越战争不得人心  美军士气低落不堪
    侵入河内市上空的美国飞贼空军上校约翰·彼得·弗林被活捉后，对记者描述他入侵越南北方时的心情说：“我怕得心脏怦怦地跳，并且冒出汗来。”他说：美国侵略军中“年青的飞行员想离开空军去驾驶民航机”，“象我们这样的老飞行员只想早一点退休”。
    他说，在泰国呵叻的美国空军基地，美国指挥官请来许多神甫给美国飞行员打气。但是飞行员的士气仍然低落不堪。他说：美国侵越战争和以前的侵朝战争一样，“都是不得人心的战争”。
    在驻西欧的美军中，反对美国侵越战争的情绪日益增长。据报道，最近一年来，有一千多名驻西欧的美国兵开了小差，其中有百分之七十是由于反对侵越战争。
    许多开小差的美国兵强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南进行的侵略战争。据美国《国民前卫》周报报道，一个名叫腊斯蒂的美国士兵说，他认识到“美国正在越南进行一场肮脏的战争”。一个名叫乔伊的美国士兵说，他开小差是由于他“反对美国在越南以及其它地方所推行的干涉别国人民革命的帝国主义政策”。
    参加侵越战争的美国航空母舰“勇猛号”，十月十七日在日本横须贺港靠岸时，有四名美国水兵趁下船“休假”的机会逃走。
    十三日晚，这四名美国水兵通过日本一团体向报界发表声明，谴责美国对越南进行侵略战争是“犯罪行为”，声明说，“我们相信我们的行动是正确的”，这个“行动的目的，是为了促使美国人民都起来”反对侵略越南战争。（附图片）
