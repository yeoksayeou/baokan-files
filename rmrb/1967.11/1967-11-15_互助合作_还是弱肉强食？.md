The Soviet revisionist clique recently, in discussing the so-called "new type of socialist international relations," shamelessly boasted about the alleged "economic cooperation" between the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries and Mongolia. They went on and on about how the "solid foundation of the socialist commonwealth has been laid," how "various forms of collective economic, political, and military cooperation (the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, the Warsaw Pact, the bilateral treaty system, etc.) have been established," and how "rich experience in joint action by socialist countries on the international stage has been accumulated."

This is all sheer nonsense!

For a long time, the Soviet revisionists have used "international division of labor" and "production specialization" as pretexts, through the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), to engage in blatant acts of great-power chauvinism and national egoism, politically tightening their control over the other CMEA member countries and economically plundering them, and promoting neo-colonialism.

What is the true nature of the so-called "international division of labor" that the Soviet revisionists have implemented through the CMEA? In essence, it means that the other CMEA member countries must produce what the Soviet revisionists dictate and refrain from producing what they forbid, thereby depriving these countries of the right to independently develop their economies.

Under the guise of "international division of labor," the Soviet revisionists bully the economically backward CMEA member countries, forcing them to serve as raw material suppliers and markets for Soviet goods. This is no different from the imperialist exploitation of colonies. For example, the Soviet revisionists have adopted this policy towards Bulgaria. Under the conditions of a huge price difference between industrial and agricultural products and the ruthless exploitation by the Soviet revisionists, Bulgaria supplies the Soviet Union with large quantities of fruits and vegetables every year, but in return, it can only obtain a few Soviet-made machines. This is the "benefit" that the Soviet revisionist clique boasts about, brought by their so-called "economic cooperation" to the broad masses of laboring people in the CMEA member countries!

Under the guise of "international division of labor," the Soviet revisionists control the industrial production of other member countries, turning these countries' industries into appendages of the Soviet revisionists, deepening their economic dependence on the Soviet revisionists. Many Eastern European countries import industrial raw materials from the Soviet Union, and the products they produce according to the Soviet Union's specified types, models, and specifications for "division of labor" must be purchased by the Soviet Union. For example, Poland's imported industrial raw materials are largely supplied by the Soviet Union, with some reaching 80% of the required amount, while important export commodities such as ships and carriages are mostly purchased by the Soviet Union. Through such means, the Soviet revisionists control the economic lifelines of the other CMEA member countries and use political blackmail and extortion against them. Where is there even a trace of "economic mutual aid" in this?

Under the guise of "international division of labor," the Soviet revisionists force certain member countries to abandon the production of traditional products, a practice that is identical to the imperialist method of strangling the economies of colonies and semi-colonies. In 1962, the Soviet revisionists, under the pretext of "international division of labor," forcibly strangled Hungary's traditional aluminum smelting industry. Hungary has abundant aluminum ore resources and has been mining and refining it since liberation. However, according to the new "regulations" of the Soviet revisionists, Hungary can only mine and refine bauxite into alumina and sell it cheaply to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union then processes it slightly, refines it into aluminum ingots, and sells it back to Hungary at a high price. This is sheer robbery. According to the CMEA's "international division of labor" regulations, Hungary is not allowed to produce ordinary trucks and ships over 1,500 tons, nor is it allowed to produce radios. It was forced to dismantle all the equipment of its historically famous radio factory and hand it over to another country. This is not "economic cooperation" at all; it is outright law of the jungle.

The Soviet revisionists also use "international division of labor" as a pretext to engage in unequal exchange, shifting their domestic economic difficulties, and forcibly buying and selling, taking advantage of others. Under the manipulation of "international division of labor," many countries lack the raw materials and equipment they need and have to rely on the Soviet revisionists, who then take advantage of the situation to force other countries to accept monopolistic high prices. It is well known that the Soviet revisionists sell crude oil to Eastern European countries at prices about twice the international market price. Other items such as diesel, coal, iron sand, pig iron, wool, cotton, vegetable oil, and so on, the Soviet revisionists all raise the prices and force the other CMEA member countries to accept them, even shamelessly demanding "foreign exchange, dollars." On the other hand, the Soviet revisionists drastically lower the prices for goods imported from other CMEA member countries. Clearly, the so-called "international division of labor" and "economic cooperation" of the Soviet revisionists are synonymous with extortion and robbery!

Enough! Enough! The above are the so-called "rich experiences" of the CMEA under the control of the Soviet revisionists. These are experiences of the law of the jungle, experiences of the Soviet revisionists promoting neo-colonialism, and experiences of ruthless exploitation.

In fact, the so-called "international division of labor" and "economic cooperation" promoted by the Soviet revisionists are nothing new; they are merely picking up the broken pieces of the so-called "economic integration" and "common market" established by the monopoly capitalist groups to compete for markets and divide profits. The only difference is that they have slapped a "socialist" label on it!

The Soviet revisionist clique's boasting about the CMEA is purely a case of the guilty trying to cover up their crimes, fearing that their tool of exploitation, the CMEA, will completely collapse. The Soviet revisionist clique, using "international division of labor" as a cover, ruthlessly exploits the peoples of other member countries through the CMEA and has done all sorts of harm to others for their own benefit, thinking they have succeeded. In reality, the result will only be "lifting a stone to drop on one's own feet." The peoples of various countries exploited and oppressed by the Soviet revisionist clique will inevitably rise up to revolt against these new colonialists. All exploitative systems will inevitably be smashed to pieces by the revolutionary people.

    “互助合作”还是弱肉强食？
    对外贸易部  武益
    苏修集团最近在提到“新型的社会主义国际关系”时，厚颜无耻地把苏联同东欧一些国家和蒙古的所谓“经济合作”关系吹得天花乱坠，说什么“社会主义国家共同体的巩固基础奠定了，这些国家之间建立了各种形式的集体的经济政治和军事合作（经济互助委员会、华沙条约组织、双边条约体系等），积累了社会主义国家在国际舞台上共同行动的丰富经验”。
    这完全是骗人的鬼话！
    长期以来，苏修集团以“国际分工”和“生产专业化”为幌子，通过“经互会”，大干损人利己的大国沙文主义和民族利己主义的勾当，对“经互会”其他成员国政治上加紧控制，经济上肆意掠夺，推行新殖民主义。
    苏修利用“经互会”实行的所谓“国际分工”究竟是什么货色？说穿了，就是“经互会”的其他成员国，应该生产什么，不得生产什么，都得听从苏修的摆布，从而剥夺了这些国家独立自主地发展经济的权利。
    苏修以“国际分工”为名，欺压“经互会”中经济比较落后的成员国，迫使它们作为苏修原料供应地和商品销售市场。这同帝国主义对殖民地的剥削完全是一路货色。例如，苏修对保加利亚就是采取这种政策。在工农业产品差价悬殊和苏修的残酷剥削下，保加利亚每年供应苏联大量水果、蔬菜，也换不了几台苏制机器。这就是苏修集团所吹嘘的“经济合作”给
  “经互会”成员国广大劳动人民带来的“好处”！
    苏修以“国际分工”为名，控制其他成员国的工业生产，使这些国家工业变为苏修的附属工厂，加深了经济上对苏修的依附。许多东欧国家要从苏联进口原料，而按照苏联规定的品种、型号、规格“分工”生产出来的产品，又要靠苏联收购。例如，波兰进口的工业原料靠苏联供应的，有的竟占需要量的百分之八十，而出口的重要物资如船舶、车厢，绝大部分靠苏联购买。通过这样的手段，苏修就把“经互会”其他成员国的经济命脉控制在自己的手里，并且对各成员国进行政治上的要挟和讹诈。这哪里有一丝一毫“经济互助”的气味！
    苏修以“国际分工”为名，硬要某些成员国放弃传统产品的生产，这种做法，同帝国主义扼杀殖民地半殖民地经济的手段如出一辙。一九六二年，苏修以“国际分工”为借口，强行扼杀了匈牙利传统的炼铝工业，就是一例。匈牙利有丰富的铝矿资源，解放后一直由本国开采和提炼。但是按照苏修的新“规定”，匈牙利只能采掘铝矾土，炼成氧化铝后，廉价卖给苏联，由苏联稍为加工，提炼成铝锭后，再以高价向匈牙利出售。这真是十足的抢劫。按照“经互会”的“国际分工”规定，匈牙利还不许生产普通卡车和一千五百吨以上的船只，甚至不许生产收音机，它被强迫把历史悠久的收音机工厂设备全部拆除，运交别国。这根本不是什么“经济合作”，而是不折不扣的弱肉强食。
    苏修还以“国际分工”为名，大搞不等价交换，转嫁国内的经济困难，强买强卖，巧取豪夺。在“国际分工”的摆布下，许多国家缺乏自己需要的原料、设备，不得不有求于苏修，而苏修就奇货可居，强使别国接受垄断高价。苏修以高于国际市价约一倍的价格向东欧国家销售原油，已为人所共知。其他如柴油、煤、铁砂、生铁，直到羊毛、棉花、植物油等等，苏修无不抬高价格，强迫“经互会”其他成员国接受，甚至无耻地以收取“外汇、美元”相要挟。另一方面，苏修对从“经互会”其他成员国进口的商品，却极力压低价格。可见，苏修所谓的“国际分工”和“经济合作”，就是敲诈勒索的同义语！
    够了！够了！以上这些就是苏修控制下的“经互会”的“丰富经验”。这是弱肉强食的“经验”，是苏修推行新殖民主义的“经验”，是进行残酷剥削的“经验”。
    其实，苏修推行的所谓“国际分工”和“经济合作”并不是什么新鲜玩艺，不过是拣起了垄断资本集团为了争夺市场、瓜分利润而建立的所谓“经济一体化”和“共同市场”的破烂。所不同者，只是给它贴上了“社会主义”的标签而已！
    苏修叛徒集团大肆吹嘘“经互会”，完全是做贼心虚，生怕他们的剥削工具“经互会”彻底垮台。苏修集团用“国际分工”做幌子，通过“经互会”残酷地剥削其他成员国人民，干尽了损人利己的坏事，自以为得计。其实，结果只能是“搬起石头砸自己的脚”。被苏修集团剥削、压榨的各国人民，迟早要起来造这伙新殖民主义者的反。一切剥削制度必将被革命人民统统砸烂。
