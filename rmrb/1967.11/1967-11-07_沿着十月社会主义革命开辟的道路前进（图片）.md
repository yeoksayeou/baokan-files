Fifty years ago, under the leadership of the great teacher of the proletariat, Lenin, the October Socialist Revolution, through violent revolution, smashed the old state machine and created the first proletarian dictatorship in human history, a socialist state. Under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people, following the path of the October Revolution, achieved great victories in defeating the White Guard rebellion and the armed intervention of fourteen countries, in crushing the opportunist line of the counter-revolutionary bourgeois representatives Trotskys, Bukharins, and the like who had infiltrated the party, in achieving great victories in socialist transformation and socialist construction, and in achieving great victories in the anti-fascist war.

After Stalin's death, the Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the party and the state, betrayed the October Revolution, and betrayed Lenin, causing socialist Soviet Union to change color. Today, under the reactionary rule of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like, the Soviet Union has become the center of modern counter-revolutionary revisionism and another stronghold of world reactionary forces.

Our great leader, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The Soviet Union is the first socialist state, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the Soviet people, the broad masses of party members and cadres, are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long." The Soviet people will surely unite under the banner of the great October Revolution, inherit the will of Lenin and Stalin, persist in long-term struggle, break through the darkness, and make the red star of the October Revolution shine more brilliantly.

	The great Marxist-Leninist—Stalin
	The great proletarian revolutionary leader—Lenin

The cannon fire of the cruiser "Aurora" at the Winter Palace, the seat of the reactionary Provisional Government, announced the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution. This is Lenin and Stalin in the Smolny Institute.

On July 19, 1917, the bourgeois Provisional Government ordered the arrest of Lenin. The party decided to hide Lenin at the shore of Lake Razliv. Here, Lenin wrote the famous book "The State and Revolution." To refute the counter-revolutionary revisionist "theory" of Kautsky and others who opposed the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, Lenin repeatedly pointed out that the proletarian revolution must smash the bourgeois state machine and establish proletarian dictatorship. He said: "The bourgeois state is replaced by the proletarian state (proletarian dictatorship), not through 'self-dissolution,' according to general laws, only through violent revolution."

In the early hours of November 7, 1917, under Lenin's personal leadership, the uprising workers and peasants captured the Winter Palace, overthrew the reactionary bourgeois Provisional Government, and the great October Socialist Revolution was victorious!

    沿着十月社会主义革命开辟的道路前进（图片）
    五十年前，无产阶级的伟大导师列宁领导的十月社会主义革命，经过暴力革命，打碎旧的国家机器，创建了人类历史上第一个无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。在列宁和斯大林的领导下，苏联人民又沿着十月革命的道路，取得了战胜白卫军叛乱和十四个国家武装干涉的伟大胜利，取得了粉碎钻进党内的反革命资产阶级代表人物托洛茨基、布哈林之流的机会主义路线的伟大胜利，取得了社会主义改造和社会主义建设的伟大胜利，取得了反法西斯战争的伟大胜利。
    斯大林逝世以后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了党和国家的领导，背叛了十月革命，背叛了列宁，使社会主义的苏联改变了颜色。今天在勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的反动统治下，苏联已变成了现代反革命修正主义的中心，变成了世界反动势力的又一个大本营。
    我们的伟大领袖、世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席教导我们：“苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”苏联人民一定会在伟大十月革命的旗帜下团结起来，继承列宁、斯大林的遗志，坚持长期斗争，冲破重重黑暗，使十月革命的红星，重新放射出更加灿烂的光辉。

    “阿芙乐尔”巡洋舰向反动的临时政府所在地冬宫轰击的炮声，宣布了伟大十月社会主义革命的胜利。这是列宁和斯大林在斯莫尔尼宫。
    一九一七年七月十九日，资产阶级临时政府下令逮捕列宁，党决定让列宁隐匿到拉兹里夫湖畔。在这里，列宁写成了著名的《国家与革命》一书。为了粉碎考茨基之流反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的反革命修正主义“理论”，列宁反复地指出，无产阶级革命必须打碎资产阶级的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政。他说：“资产阶级国家由无产阶级国家（无产阶级专政）代替，不能通过‘自行消亡’，根据一般规律，只能通过暴力革命。”
    一九一七年十一月七日深夜，在列宁亲自领导下，起义的工人、农民攻下了冬宫，推翻了反动的资产阶级临时政府，伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利了！
