“Voice of the Thai People” radio station broadcasted an article titled “Long Live the Spirit of the October Socialist Revolution!” on November 7 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution.

The article points out that the path of the October Socialist Revolution led by Lenin and Stalin is the only path for the oppressed and exploited people to achieve true liberation, and it is also the only path to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation.

The article states that under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people have inherited the spirit of the October Socialist Revolution, established a powerful socialist China, and made China a strong revolutionary bastion for the people of the world to oppose imperialism led by the United States.

The article states that the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao Zedong, has developed Marxism-Leninism on seizing power and consolidating the proletarian dictatorship. The current ongoing Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which will further consolidate the proletarian dictatorship in China and ensure the thorough victory of the Chinese socialist revolution, thus making a significant contribution to the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.

The article states that under the profound influence of the October Socialist Revolution and the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the armed struggles of the people of Vietnam, Laos, Burma, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand, along with the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have powerfully struck at imperialism, especially American imperialism. They are advancing from victory to victory along the path indicated by the October Socialist Revolution.

The article condemns the Soviet revisionist clique for colluding with American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries to viciously sabotage and suppress the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries.

The article also strongly condemns the Soviet revisionist clique for colluding with the American imperialists and the Thanom-Prapas sellout clique to maliciously sabotage the revolutionary struggle of the Thai people.

The article finally emphasizes that although the Soviet revisionist clique has usurped the leadership of the Soviet Party and state, changing the color of socialist Soviet Union, and although they collude with the American imperialists and reactionaries of various countries in an attempt to sabotage the world revolution, the revolutionary tide of the world is unstoppable. Under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary people of the world are advancing along the path of the October Socialist Revolution.
