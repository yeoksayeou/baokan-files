After more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our southern gateway – Guangzhou – appears more vibrant and youthful.

Under the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the China Export Commodities Fair opened in Guangzhou. Friends from the trade circles of the five continents, as well as overseas Chinese and compatriots from Hong Kong and Macau, flocked to this city full of revolutionary vigor to participate in this grand, innovative, and content-rich international trade fair.

Imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries, out of their deep hatred for China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have recently barked and launched vicious attacks against the fair. However, their schemes have completely failed, and the thriving scene of the fair has dealt a heavy blow to the enemy.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has propelled the development of China's socialist construction.

The great spiritual power unleashed by the hundreds of millions of workers and peasants in China's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has driven the rapid development of China's industrial, agricultural, and national defense construction. The nearly 30,000 items and exhibits displayed at this grand fair vividly reflect the new achievements in industrial and agricultural production across the country, showcasing the great fruits of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the exhibition halls, visitors saw the new face of China's rapidly developing petroleum and chemical industries. Heroic petroleum workers achieved inspiring victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In 1966, China's petroleum production increased significantly compared to 1965, and in the first nine months of this year, petroleum production again surpassed the same period last year. Among the 330-plus products displayed in the chemical hall, over 90 are new products, most of which were successfully developed and put into production during the Cultural Revolution. Basic construction projects in the chemical industry are being completed one after another. This fair also displayed more mechanical and instrumental samples than previous fairs. Among the mechanical products on display, two-thirds are new products designed and developed or significantly improved during the Cultural Revolution. In the mechanical hall, rows of working mother machines and sets of large, precise equipment are on display. Among them is a high-precision instrument lathe. The workpieces processed by this lathe have a surface smoothness of 12 degrees, as smooth as a mirror. Currently, only a few countries in the world can produce such lathes. This lathe, which has reached the world's advanced level, was designed and manufactured by the revolutionary workers of the Shanghai Instrument Factory during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The factory's revolutionary workers thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the capitalist roaders within the Party, represented by China's Khrushchev, and the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie in the field of science and technology, who promoted a slave mentality, a crawling mentality, and an abolitionist mentality. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must break the rules and adopt advanced technology as much as possible," and decided to forge their own path, overcoming various difficulties in the design and trial production process. They finally used a domestically produced hard alloy steel to make cutting tools. This new cutting tool can completely replace imported diamond cutting tools, processing high-precision workpieces, while the production cost is only one-thousandth of that of diamond cutting tools. Similar new products with world-advanced levels, such as high-precision instrument lathes, are also on display at this fair. A "CAY-13" type parallel cylinder diesel engine displayed in the mechanical hall is small in size but has a large horsepower and is considered by foreign merchants to be a product with advanced technology in the current international marine power machinery.

Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, China's agricultural production has also achieved universal bumper harvests. The exhibits in the agricultural and sideline products exhibition hall reflect the victories achieved by the hundreds of millions of peasants and revolutionary cadres in rural areas across the country in both revolution and production. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticized the revisionist line of China's Khrushchev in the agricultural front, and resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." This year, whether in the south or north of the Yangtze River, inside or outside the Great Wall, good news of bumper harvests in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries has been frequently reported. Summer and autumn grain crops have both been good harvest years. Soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and other oil crops have seen significant increases in production; cotton, which has seen significant increases in production for four consecutive years, has also had a bumper harvest this year. The production of hemp, silkworm cocoons, and sugar and tobacco crops has also increased significantly. Particularly noteworthy is that among the exhibits, there are many grain and agricultural products that come from places that are providing export commodities to the country for the first time. This situation indicates that during the Cultural Revolution, regions that were originally poor in production conditions and low in production levels have also undergone tremendous changes.

The Cultural Revolution has brought out the greatest wisdom and creativity of the masses.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The people have limitless creativity." The stormy winds of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have swept away the dust and dirt in people's minds, making the spiritual face of the Chinese people completely renewed, and their wisdom and creativity have been fully unleashed. Many ordinary young workers and young technicians who have just graduated from school are not only pioneers in the Cultural Revolution but also a new force in the production struggle. They dare to rebel against the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie and dare to declare war on the slave mentality of worshipping books and foreigners. Many new products displayed at the fair, which were developed and produced during the Cultural Revolution, are the crystallization of this revolutionary spirit. Among the more than 90 medical devices displayed in the medical equipment hall, there are the main surgical instruments for the world's first successful finger reattachment, as well as ultrasound diagnostic instruments suitable for medical personnel to provide mobile medical services in rural areas. Many commonly used medical devices for export have reached international advanced levels in quality and performance. An electronic blood cell counter used by hospital laboratory personnel to examine human blood, which is one of the products subject to imperialist blockade against China, has been manufactured by the young workers and technicians of the Shanghai Medical Instrument Factory after arduous efforts and can now be exported. The actual object and a set of clinical operation photos of the artificial spherical heart bicuspid valve, which marks one of the latest achievements in China's medical technology, are also on display at the fair for the first time. This was manufactured by a certain department of the People's Liberation Army in 1966 after two years and three months of bold experiments, breaking the imperialist technological blockade and creating it themselves. Currently, only a few countries in the world can manufacture such artificial heart valves. This medical technology achievement has now been promoted domestically and applied in clinical treatment.

Let those who think they are the smartest block more tightly! History will continue to prove that the proletariat of the East is a thousand times more brilliant than the bourgeoisie of the West. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, we resolutely walk our own path.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has launched a magnificent movement to destroy the old and establish the new, causing a great change in the content of our country's products. As the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All the decayed ideology and other unsuited parts of the superstructure are crumbling day by day." Many daily consumer goods that were once full of feudal and bourgeois ideology have undergone thorough reforms and have been replaced by revolutionary political content. The changes in textiles and light industrial products displayed at this fair are most prominent. The design and craftsmanship of textiles and the pattern designs of glassware and enamel products in light industry are full of revolutionary spirit. Ninety percent of the products provided by the textile industries of Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, Liaoning, Shandong, and Jiangsu for this fair are new varieties and colors designed during the Cultural Revolution. These products have completely eliminated the feudal and capitalist colors of the past and present a new appearance. These are the results of the revolutionary cadres of the design departments, who, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly destroyed the old and established the new, and resolutely walked the revolutionary path.

China's traditional folk arts and crafts are also changing their appearance under the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad masses of revolutionary folk arts and crafts workers have turned arts and crafts into a tool to serve proletarian politics and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In the past year, China's arts and crafts have produced a large number of excellent works, enthusiastically singing the praises of the new reality of the great Mao Zedong era in New China, and depicting the spiritual appearance of advanced figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary heroes. The exhibits include various sculptures and large embroidery products that sing the praises of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, works that depict the images of workers, peasants, and heroes, and the deeds of advanced figures studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary arts and crafts workers in China have timely created large-scale works for the arts and crafts hall of the fair that depict the struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against British colonial rule, expressing their revolutionary enthusiasm to support this just struggle. The exhibits of ivory carvings, jade carvings, shell carvings, stone carvings, stone engravings, and embroidery, which have a long history, have discarded the dregs of feudalism and shone brilliantly on the broad road of nationalization and revolutionization.

Hail the new era of the world entering with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner!

The book exhibition hall displays a large number of Chairman Mao's works published in various languages. More of Chairman Mao's works will be circulated to various parts of the world through this fair, further satisfying the demands and aspirations of revolutionary people around the world.

The boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought is the strongest and sharpest ideological weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. Revolutionary people around the world yearn to obtain the red book of Chairman Mao's works. Revolutionary publishers and workers in China regard the publication of Chairman Mao's works in various languages of the world to satisfy the aspirations of the world's revolutionary people as a sacred duty to support the world revolution. In the more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while publishing and distributing a large number of Chinese versions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Quotations from Chairman Mao," they also translated and published a large number of foreign language versions of Chairman Mao's works and distributed them to the world. Now, Chairman Mao's works have been translated into dozens of languages and published. In 1966, the circulation of foreign language versions of Chairman Mao's works was equivalent to 100 times the circulation in 1952. The "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which has been praised by revolutionary people around the world as a revolutionary red book, has been translated into 24 languages and published in more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. From October 1966 to September 1967, the foreign language version of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" was circulated in 128 countries and regions, totaling 13.3 million copies.

However, this is still far from meeting the urgent needs of the world's revolutionary people. Many countries and regions have independently translated and published a large number of Chairman Mao's works. According to incomplete statistics, in foreign countries, more than 60 countries and regions have translated and published more than 670 kinds of selected and single editions of Chairman Mao's works in more than 60 different languages. The book exhibition hall displays many Chairman Mao's works translated and published by foreign friends. Among them, there is a Lao version of "Selected Works of Chairman Mao" and a "Quotations from Chairman Mao," which are printed on rough paper. The cover features a red portrait of Chairman Mao. These two mimeographed versions of Chairman Mao's works tell people how much the revolutionary people of the world need Chairman Mao's books and how much the revolutionary struggles of all ethnic groups in the world need the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

Revolutionary publishers and workers in China fully understand the urgent feelings of all revolutionary people who love Mao Zedong Thought. Before the opening of the new session of the fair, they published a large number of foreign language versions of Chairman Mao's works. At present, more than 150 countries and regions have placed orders with China for Chairman Mao's works. At this session of the fair, more friends will obtain the various language versions of Chairman Mao's works that they urgently need.

The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly spreading widely around the world, which is the most important sign of the current good international situation. China's unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is continuing to powerfully promote the development of the world revolution. Today's world has entered a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. Learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought has become a mass movement on a global scale, the scale of which and the depth of its influence are unprecedented in the history of Marxism-Leninism.

In the book exhibition hall, one can see many letters from friends around the world, full of revolutionary enthusiasm. A Japanese friend wrote: "I enthusiastically cheer for the great development and smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years! When I think of the unique genius in several centuries, the great Chairman Mao leading this cultural revolution personally, and this cultural revolution being inherited by all the people of the world as a magical weapon, my heart beats so fast that it seems it will burst!"

A New Zealand friend wrote: "The heart of the world revolution is beating in China. We celebrate with you the spread of Marxist thought among the broad masses of people and the deep understanding and mastery of Mao Zedong Thought by the people."

An American friend wrote: "We are very eager to obtain the red book 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' so that we can better follow this great person, leader, and teacher, and better dedicate ourselves to the movement he leads to make the world a world for the people! To obtain a copy of 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I am willing to pay any price and dedicate anything that needs to be dedicated. Long live Chairman Mao and his teachings!"

    无产阶级文化大革命的胜利凯歌
    ——记一九六七年秋季中国出口商品交易会
    经历了一年多无产阶级文化大革命的战斗洗礼，我国南方的门户——广州，显得更加英姿飒爽，青春焕发。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，中国出口商品交易会在广州开幕了。来自五大洲的各国贸易界朋友和海外华侨、港澳同胞，纷纷来到这个充满革命朝气的城市，参加这一规模盛大、面貌崭新、内容丰富的国际贸易盛会。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，出于他们对中国无产阶级文化大革命的刻骨仇恨，最近对交易会发出了一阵狂吠，进行恶毒的攻击。可是，他们的如意算盘彻底落空了，交易会的欣欣向荣的景象，给了敌人以沉重的打击。
    文化大革命推动我国社会主义建设事业飞速发展
    我国亿万工农群众在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中迸发出来的伟大精神力量，推动着我国工农业生产和国防建设事业的飞速发展。这次规模盛大的交易会展出的近三万种商品和展品，生动地反映了全国各地工农业生产的新成就，显示了我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大成果。
    在展览馆里，人们看到了我国石油、化学工业飞速发展的新面貌。英雄的石油工人在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了鼓舞人心的胜利。一九六六年我国石油的产量比一九六五年有很大增长，今年头九个月的石油产量，又超过了去年同期的水平。在化工馆展出的三百三十多种产品中，新产品就有九十多种，这些新产品绝大多数是在文化大革命中试制成功和投入生产的。化学工业的基本建设项目一个接着一个完成。这次交易会展出的机械、仪器的样品，也比历届交易会都要多。展出的机械产品中，有三分之二是在文化大革命中设计试制成功或者是有了显著改进的新产品。在机械馆里，陈列着一排排不同性能的工作母机和成套大型精密设备。其中有一台高精度仪表车床，用这台车床加工出来的工作物，表面光洁度达到十二度，平滑得如同镜子一般。目前，世界上还只有少数国家能够生产这样的车床。这台具有世界先进水平的车床，是上海仪表厂的革命职工，在无产阶级文化大革命中自行设计制造的。这个厂的革命职工，彻底批判了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”在科学技术工作中推行的奴隶主义、爬行主义、取消主义的反革命修正主义路线，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“必须打破常规，尽量采用先进技术”，决心走自己的道路，克服了设计试制过程中遇到的种种困难，终于用一种国产硬质合金钢制成刀具。这种新的刀具完全能够代替从国外进口的金刚钻刀具，加工出高精度的工件来，而生产成本却只要金刚钻刀具的千分之一。象高精度仪表车床一样具有世界先进水平的新产品，在这次交易会上展出的还有不少。机械馆里展出的一台“CAY—13”型并列汽缸式柴油机，体积很小，马力很大，就被各国客商认为是目前国际上船舶动力机械中具有先进水平的产品。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，我国农业生产也获得了普遍丰收。农副产品展览馆里的展品，反映了全国亿万农民和广大农村革命干部，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农业战线上推行的修正主义路线，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在革命、生产两方面所取得的胜利。今年，无论大江南北，长城内外，农、林、牧、副、渔的丰收喜讯频传，夏粮作物和秋粮作物，都是个较大的丰收年景。大豆、花生、油菜籽等油料作物都有显著增产；已经连续四年获得大幅度增产的棉花，今年又是丰收。麻类、蚕茧和糖料、烤烟的产量，都有很大增长。特别引人注意的是，在展品中有不少粮食和农产品品种，是来自那些第一次为国家提供出口商品的地方。这一情况表明，在文化大革命中，原来生产条件较差、生产水平较低的地区，也发生了巨大的变化。
    文化大革命使群众的智慧和创造能力得到最大发挥
    毛主席教导我们：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨，荡涤着人们头脑里的灰尘污垢，使我国亿万人民的精神面貌焕然一新，使他们的智慧和创造能力得到了最大的发挥。许多普通的青年工人和刚刚走出学校大门的年轻的技术人员，不但是文化大革命中的闯将，在生产斗争中，他们也是一支生力军。他们敢于起来造资产阶级反动学术“权威”的反，敢于向迷信书本、迷信洋人的奴隶主义宣战。交易会展出的许多在文化大革命中试制和生产出来的新产品，就是这种革命精神的结晶。在医疗器械馆展出的九十多种医疗设备中，包括世界上第一个断指再植成功的主要手术器械，以及适应医务人员到农村巡回医疗使用的超声波诊断仪等。许多提供出口的常用医疗设备，质量和性能都达到了国际先进水平。有一台医院化验人员检验人体血液用的电子血球计数器，是帝国主义对我国实行封锁的产品之一。这种设备已经由上海医疗器械厂的青年工人和技术人员经过艰苦奋斗制造出来，并且已经可以提供出口标志我国医疗技术最新成就之一的人造球形心脏二尖瓣膜的实物和一套临床施行更换手术的照片，也在交易会上首次展出。这是一九六六年我人民解放军某部医院经过两年零三个月的大胆试验，打破帝国主义的技术封锁，自己制造出来的。目前世界上只有极少数国家能制造这种人造心脏瓣膜。现在这一医疗技术新成就已在国内推广，应用于临床治疗。
    让那些自以为最聪明的人去封锁得更严密些吧！历史将不断地证明，东方的无产阶级要比西方的资产阶级高明千万倍。高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗坚决走自己的道路
    无产阶级文化大革命掀起轰轰烈烈的破四旧、立四新的运动，使我国生产的商品在内容上发生了巨大的变化。正如伟大领袖毛主席所指示的：“一切腐朽的意识形态和上层建筑的其他不适用的部分，一天一天地土崩瓦解了。”许多过去充满封建主义色彩和宣传资产阶级意识的日用消费品，进行了彻底的革新，已经被革命化的政治内容所代替。这届交易会展出的纺织品和轻工业品，在这方面的变化最突出。纺织品的设计工艺和轻工业品中的玻璃器皿、搪瓷制品的花式图案设计，充满了革命的气息。上海、北京、天津、辽宁、山东、江苏等地的纺织工业部门为这次交易会提供的产品，百分之九十都是在文化大革命中设计出来的新品种、新花色。这些产品一扫过去那种封建主义和资本主义色彩，呈现着崭新的面貌。这些都是设计部门的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大破四旧，大立四新，坚决走自己的道路——革命化道路的结果。
    我国传统的工艺美术，也在无产阶级文化大革命中改变着面貌。广大的革命民间工艺美术工作者，把工艺美术变成了为无产阶级政治服务、为工农兵服务的工具。一年多来，我国的工艺美术涌现了大量的优秀作品，热情歌颂了伟大的毛泽东时代的新中国的崭新的现实生活，表现了工农兵先进人物和革命英雄人物的精神面貌。展品中有歌颂我国人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的各种雕刻和大型刺绣制品，有表现工农兵和英雄人物形象以及先进人物活学活用毛主席著作的事迹的作品。我国革命的工艺美术工作者，及时为交易会的工艺美术馆创作了表现港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的大型作品，表达了他们支援港九爱国同胞这一正义斗争的革命热情。在这次交易会上展出的象牙雕刻、玉雕、贝雕、石雕、石刻、刺绣等有悠久历史的工艺美术品，已经抛弃了封建主义的糟粕，在民族化、革命化的宽广道路上放出异彩。
    欢呼全世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代
    交易会的书籍馆里，陈列着用各种文字大量出版的毛主席著作。将有更多的毛主席著作，通过这一届交易会发行到世界各地，进一步满足全世界革命人民的要求和渴望。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是全世界革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大最锐利的思想武器。全世界的革命人民渴望着能够得到红色宝书毛主席著作。我国革命的出版工作者、革命的工人们，把出版世界各民族文字版的毛主席著作，满足世界革命人民的渴望，看作是支援世界革命的神圣职责。在无产阶级文化大革命的一年多时间里，他们在大量出版发行汉文版《毛泽东选集》和《毛主席语录》的同时，还大量翻译出版外文版的毛主席著作，发行到全世界。现在，毛主席著作已经翻译成几十种文字出版。一九六六年外文版毛主席著作的发行量，相当于一九五二年发行量的一百倍。被全世界革命人民誉为革命红宝书的《毛主席语录》，在无产阶级文化大革命的一年多时间里，就已翻译成二十四种文字出版发行。从一九六六年十月到一九六七年九月的一年内，外文版《毛主席语录》就在一百二十八个国家和地区发行了一千三百三十万册。
    但是，这还远远不能满足世界革命人民的迫切要求。许多国家和地区都自行翻译出版了大量毛主席著作。根据极不完全的统计，在国外，有六十多个国家和地区，用六十多种不同文字翻译出版了六百七十多种毛主席著作的选本和单行本。书籍馆里陈列着许多外国朋友翻译出版的毛主席著作。其中有一本老挝文版的《毛主席著作选编》和一本《毛主席语录》，是用粗糙的纸张出版的。封面上是一幅红色的毛主席像。这两本油印版的毛主席著作告诉人们，全世界革命人民多么需要毛主席的书，世界各族人民的革命斗争多么需要毛泽东思想的指导！
    我国革命的出版工作者和革命工人，充分理解一切革命人民热爱毛泽东思想的迫切心情，在新的一届交易会开幕以前，大量出版了各种外文版的毛主席著作。目前，已经有一百五十多个国家和地区向我国订购毛主席著作。在这一届交易会上，将有更多的朋友得到他们所迫切需要的各种文版的毛主席著作。
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界迅速广泛传播，是当前国际形势大好的最重要的标志。史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命，正在继续有力地推动着世界革命的发展。今天的世界，已经进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的革命新时代。学习和运用毛泽东思想已经成为一个世界范围的群众运动，其规模之大，影响之深，是马克思列宁主义发展史上从来没有过的。
    在书籍馆里，可以看到世界各国朋友写的洋溢着革命热情的许多来信。一位日本朋友写道：“我热烈地为无产阶级文化大革命的伟大发展和顺利进行，欢呼万岁！万岁！万万岁！当我想到几个世纪中独一无二的天才、伟大的毛泽东主席亲自领导的这场文化大革命，作为法宝被全世界人民继承下来的时候，我的心由于兴奋而跳动得快要破裂了。”
    一位新西兰朋友写道：“世界革命的心脏在中国跳动着。我们同你们一起欢庆马克思主义思想在广大人民群众中得到传播，欢庆人民群众深入理解和掌握毛泽东思想。”
    一位美国朋友来信说：“我们非常希望得到《毛主席语录》这本红书，以便能够更好地跟随这位伟大人物、领袖和导师，更好地献身于他所领导的把世界变为一个属于人民的世界运动！为了获得一本《毛主席语录》，我不惜付出任何代价，不惜献出任何需要献出的东西。毛主席和他的学说万岁！”　新华社记者
