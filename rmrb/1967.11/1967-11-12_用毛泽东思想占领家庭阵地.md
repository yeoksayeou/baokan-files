	Shanghai Garrison Unit of the People's Liberation Army Launches
	Intense Family Struggle Against Self and Criticism of Revisionism

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11 — The officers and family members of a certain unit of the Shanghai Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great directive to struggle against self and criticize revisionism. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they have launched a wave of family struggle against self and criticism of revisionism.

	At the beginning, some comrades thought that officers struggle against self and criticize revisionism in the army, and family members do so in the local areas, so there is no need to repeat it at home. Others thought that families are mostly about trivial daily matters, with no major issues, so it doesn't matter much whether or not it is done. In response to these thoughts, the unit's Party Committee conducted extensive ideological mobilization several times, making everyone realize that the family is a very important battlefield for class struggle. If Mao Zedong Thought is not used to occupy it, bourgeois ideology will inevitably occupy it.

	Based on this heightened awareness, family struggle against self and criticism of revisionism activities were widely launched. Everyone used the "Three Articles" as their weapon to struggle against self and criticize revisionism, treating the family as a battlefield to prevent and resist revisionism, a battleground for breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and a classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Officers and family members struggle against self and criticize revisionism every day, and hold a struggle against self and criticism of revisionism sharing meeting every week. Some family members have many children, heavy household chores, and low education, but they say: Struggle against self and criticism of revisionism is a major national and party affair, and no matter how big the difficulties, we will endure them.

	Every morning, officers and family members study Chairman Mao's teachings, and in the evening, they examine their actions against Chairman Mao's teachings, discussing who did right and who did wrong, what actions conformed to Chairman Mao's teachings, and what did not. They also focus on class education, using bitter memories and sweet recollections to deepen their class hatred against revisionism and the "self" character.

	The launch of family struggle against self and criticism of revisionism activities quickly changed the spiritual face of the family. In the past, family members often talked about trivial matters and daily chores. Now, everyone is concerned about national affairs. Husbands and wives, parents and children, when they meet, discuss the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, share their experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and care for, love, and help each other politically. In the past, some families often had the husband or parents making the decisions. Now, it is whoever speaks in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought whose words are listened to, and whoever acts in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings whose actions are followed. Everyone is determined to let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly in every family.

### 用毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地

    用毛泽东思想占领家庭阵地
    上海警备区某部热烈开展家庭斗私批修活动
    据新华社上海十一日电　中国人民解放军上海警备区某部干部和家属，坚决执行毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大指示，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，掀起了家庭斗私批修活动的热潮。
    开始时，有的同志认为干部在部队参加斗私批修，家属在地方参加斗私批修，家庭不一定再重复了。也有的认为，家庭里大多是些日常琐事，没有什么大是大非，搞不搞问题不大。针对这些活思想，部队党委多次作了广泛的思想发动，使大家认识到：家庭是阶级斗争很重要的一个阵地。如果不用毛泽东思想去占领，资产阶级思想必然去占领。
    在提高认识的基础上，家庭斗私批修活动普遍开展起来。大家以“老三篇”为武器，斗私批修，把家庭当作防修、反修的阵地，破私立公的战场，活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。干部和家属，天天斗私，天天批修，每周还召开一次斗私批修讲用会。有些家属孩子多，家务重，文化低，但是她们说：斗私批修是国家大事，党的大事，再大的困难咱们也顶住。
    每天早晨，干部和家属学习毛主席的教导，晚上对照毛主席的教导检查自己的行动，谁做得对，谁做得不对，那些符合毛主席的教导，那些不符合毛主席的教导，天天进行“讲评”。他们还狠抓阶级教育，通过忆苦思甜，加深了对修正主义和“私”字的强烈的阶级仇恨。
    开展家庭斗私批修活动，迅速地改变了家庭的精神面貌。过去一家人在一起，往往讲闲话多，讲日常家务多。现在人人关心国家大事，夫妻儿女一见面就谈论无产阶级文化大革命，相互汇报活学活用毛主席著作的心得，在政治上互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。过去有些家庭往往是丈夫说了算，父母说了算。现在是谁说的话符合毛泽东思想就听谁的，谁做的事符合毛主席的教导就照谁的办。大家决心让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍每一个家庭。（附图片）
