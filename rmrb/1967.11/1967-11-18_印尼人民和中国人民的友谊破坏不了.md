	_Indonesian Youth Voice_ Condemns the Indonesian Fascist Regime for Severing Diplomatic Relations with China

	The friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples cannot be destroyed.

	The Indonesian fascist regime, acting on the instructions of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership, will perish along with its masters for its rampant anti-China actions.

	Xinhua News Agency reports: Recently, _Indonesian Youth Voice_ published an editorial condemning the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime for severing diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China. The editorial pointed out that this action is not accidental but a continuation of the anti-China and anti-Chinese policies carried out by the Indonesian reactionary regime in accordance with the global strategy of "containing China" by U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership.

	The editorial states: The Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has been continuously engaged in anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China, and anti-Chinese activities. Apart from persecuting Chinese residents, they have also dispatched armed military and police to take barbaric actions against the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and its staff. This is unprecedented in the history of diplomatic relations between any two countries. The editorial points out: No fascist terrorist actions can destroy the genuine friendship between the Indonesian and Chinese peoples.

	The editorial states: In resisting the barbaric actions of the fascist military regime, the staff of the Chinese Embassy demonstrated their courage in defending national dignity and their unyielding will. They showed that those armed with Mao Zedong Thought are powerful and invincible. With their deep love for the great Chairman Mao, their loyalty to the motherland and its people, they defended their national flag—the Five-Star Red Flag. They defended the flag with their blood, broke through the dangers, and ensured that the red flag flew over the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia. In the recent barbaric actions taken by the Indonesian fascists, all twenty diplomatic warriors of the People's Republic of China were injured, but their fighting spirit remained undaunted. They followed Chairman Mao's teachings: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit, it will vanquish all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation, as long as there is one person, that person will continue to fight on." Indonesian revolutionaries express the highest respect for the heroic struggle of the Chinese red diplomats against the Indonesian fascist military regime. Their revolutionary heroism is worthy of emulation by all Indonesian revolutionaries.

	The editorial exposes that the Indonesian fascist regime's Foreign Minister Malik had previously stated in a conversation with the reactionary "KAMI" elements ("Indonesian Student Action Union") that they would sever diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. The editorial points out that the Indonesian fascist regime's severance of diplomatic relations with China is inseparable from its activities to strengthen relations with the U.S. puppet—the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in Taiwan.

	The editorial states: The actions of the Indonesian fascist regime only further expose it as a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism. The world's people see it as the greatest violator of diplomatic principles in history. It not only faces condemnation from the Chinese and Indonesian peoples but will also face condemnation from people around the world. The further destruction of Indo-China relations by the fascist regime will only further isolate itself, aligning it with American puppets and leading to its demise along with its masters.

    《印尼青年之声》谴责印尼法西斯政权中断同中国外交关系
    印尼人民和中国人民的友谊破坏不了
    印尼法西斯政权按照美帝苏修意旨猖狂反华必将同它的主子一起灭亡
    新华社讯　《印尼青年之声》最近发表社论，谴责苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权中断印尼同中国的外交关系，指出这个行动并不是偶然的，而是印尼反动政权按照美帝国主义和苏共现代修正主义领导集团“遏制中国”的全球战略而执行的反华和排华政策的继续。
    社论说：苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权一直不停地进行反共、反人民、反华排华活动。他们除了对华侨进行疯狂的迫害外，还出动武装军警对中华人民共和国驻印尼大使馆及其人员采取野蛮行动。这是历史上任何国与国之间的外交关系中所未曾有过的。社论指出：任何法西斯恐怖行动都不能破坏印尼人民和中国人民之间的真正友谊。
    社论说：在反对法西斯军人政权的野蛮行动中，中国大使馆人员表现了他们维护祖国尊严的英勇行为和坚强意志，表现出用毛泽东思想武装起来的人是强大的、不可征服的力量。他们怀着对伟大的毛泽东主席的高度热爱、对祖国和祖国人民的忠诚，保卫了他们的国旗——五星红旗。他们用鲜血保卫了国旗，冲破危险，坚持让红旗在中华人民共和国驻印尼大使馆上空飘扬。在印尼法西斯分子最近采取的野蛮行动中，中华人民共和国大使馆的二十名外交战士全部受了伤，但是他们斗志旺盛。他们遵照毛主席的教导：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”印尼革命者对中国红色外交战士面对印尼法西斯军人政权的英勇斗争，表示最崇高的敬意。他们的革命英雄主义精神值得所有印尼革命者学习。
    社论揭露了印尼法西斯政权外交部长马利克在同反动的“卡米”分子（“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”）的谈话中就说过，要同中华人民共和国断绝外交关系。社论指出，印尼法西斯政权同中国中断外交关系是同加强与美国的傀儡——台湾的蒋介石匪帮的关系的活动分不开的。
    社论说：印尼法西斯政权的行动只能更加暴露了它是美帝国主义的忠实走狗，世界人民看清了它是历史上最大的外交关系准则的违反者。它不但受到中国人民和印尼人民的谴责，也将受到全世界人民的谴责。法西斯政权进一步破坏印（尼）中关系只能更加孤立了它自己，使它同美国的傀儡聚集在一块，并且同它的主子一起灭亡。
