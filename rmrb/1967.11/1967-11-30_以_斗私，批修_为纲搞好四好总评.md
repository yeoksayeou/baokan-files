In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution nationwide, and in the midst of the new high tide of "criticize self and oppose revisionism" initiated by the people and the military under the resolute implementation of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the four-good evaluation for this year is about to be carried out throughout the army.

1967 is a year in which the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, achieved decisive victories.

Our army is the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. Over the past year, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, it has raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and actively participated in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers, in the life-and-death struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, have been infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Together with the revolutionary masses across the country, they have waged a heroic struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, defeating and thoroughly collapsing the bourgeois headquarters headed by China's Khrushchev. In carrying out the glorious tasks of safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, defending national defense, and "supporting the left, opposing the right," they have established new merits for the people.

The entire army has conducted education on the struggle between the two lines, and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers have, in the surging and surging mass movement, weathered storms, seen the world, undergone the most severe tests, and received the most comprehensive tempering. Their class struggle awareness and awareness of the struggle between the two lines have been greatly enhanced, and their ties with the people have been further strengthened. The entire army's study and application of Chairman Mao's works have reached an unprecedented new stage, and a large number of heroes and heroic collectives armed with Mao Zedong Thought have emerged. The revolutionary construction of the troops has achieved new and great successes, and extremely rich experiences have been accumulated.

To carry out this year's four-good evaluation well, to "summarize achievements, correct mistakes, and prepare for future battles," is of great significance in further implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and further strengthening the ideological revolutionization of the troops.

This year's four-good evaluation must take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline and "criticize self and oppose revisionism" as the main theme. It must emphasize the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It must review and summarize the new achievements and experiences in emphasizing proletarian politics, in the education on the struggle between the two lines, in the revolutionary great criticism, in the great storms and waves of class struggle, in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, in focusing on the essentials, in transforming one's worldview, and in revolutionizing the troops' ideology. It must review and summarize the new achievements and experiences in implementing the tasks of "supporting the left, opposing the right," in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, in following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, in firmly grasping the overall direction of the struggle, and in correctly treating the masses and humbly learning from the masses. It must review and summarize the new achievements and experiences in responding to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production, promote work, and promote preparedness." During the evaluation process, it must strengthen investigation and research, based on the actual situation of the unit, focus on the key points, and strive to solve the main problems thoroughly.

During the evaluation, the principle of self-education must be consistently upheld. Democracy must be fully advocated, the masses must be trusted and relied upon, and the masses must be allowed to educate themselves. Self-criticism must be emphasized, and "the weapon of self-criticism and the method of strengthening learning must be used to transform oneself to meet the needs of the Party and the revolution." At the same time, those who are loyal to Chairman Mao, to Mao Zedong Thought, and to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line must be highly praised.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "resolving the relationship between superiors and subordinates and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses" must be deeply understood. Cadres must go to the masses, be humble students of the soldiers, and bravely engage in self-criticism. Soldiers must enthusiastically help cadres. Cadres and soldiers must care for and help each other, learn and improve together, and further carry forward the revolutionary tradition of respecting cadres and loving soldiers and the excellent style of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness in our army.

Leadership must be strengthened. The active thoughts in the evaluation must be grasped, and the great significance of this year's four-good evaluation must be repeatedly explained to correct the attitude towards the four-good evaluation. Those who have been evaluated as four-good or five-good must be educated to be modest and prudent and to make continuous progress. Those who have not been evaluated must also see their progress, advocate their positive factors, and encourage them to catch up with the advanced.

Let us raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, under the great guideline of "criticize self and oppose revisionism," strive to create more and better four-good units and five-good soldiers, and to truly make our army a great school of Mao Zedong Thought!

    以“斗私，批修”为纲搞好四好总评
    在全国无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，在亿万军民坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，掀起“斗私，批修”的新高潮中，今年的四好总评，即将在全军普遍展开。
    一九六七年，是伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的一年。
    我军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队。一年来，在中央、中央军委和中央文革的直接领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极参加无产阶级文化大革命。广大指战员在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的生死搏斗中，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，同全国广大革命群众一起，向党内一小撮走资派进行了英勇的斗争，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部打得落花流水，全面崩溃；在执行保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫国防和“三支”“两军”等光荣任务中，为人民建立了新功。
    全军普遍进行了两条路线斗争教育，广大指战员在汹涌澎湃的群众运动中，经风雨，见世面，经受了最严峻的考验，得到了最全面的锻炼，大大提高了阶级斗争观念和路线斗争觉悟，进一步密切了同人民群众的联系。全军活学活用毛主席著作，出现了从来未有的新局面，涌现出了大量用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物和英雄集体。部队革命化建设取得了新的巨大成就，积累了极其丰富的经验。
    搞好今年的四好总评，“发扬成绩，纠正错误，以利再战”，这对进一步贯彻落实毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段，进一步加强部队的思想革命化，有着极其重大的意义。
    今年的四好总评，要以毛主席的最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲。要大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。要检查总结突出无产阶级政治，在两条路线斗争教育中，在革命的大批判中，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫，狠抓大节，改造世界观，搞好部队思想革命化等方面的新成就、新经验。要检查总结在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，正确对待群众，虚心向群众学习等方面的新成就、新经验。要检查总结响应毛主席的伟大号召，抓革命，促生产、促工作、促战备的新成就、新经验。在总评过程中，要加强调查研究，根据本单位的实际情况，抓住重点，力求把主要问题解决深透。
    总评中要始终贯彻自我教育为主的原则。要充分发扬民主，相信群众，依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己。要强调自我批评，“要用自我批评的武器和加强学习的方法，来改造自己，使适合于党与革命的需要。”同时，要大力表扬忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的先进人物和先进集体。
    要深刻领会毛主席“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的最新指示，干部要到群众中去，做群众的小学生，虚心听取战士的意见，勇于自我批评。战士要热情地帮助干部。干部战士要互相关心，互相帮助，共同学习，共同提高，进一步发扬我军尊干爱兵的革命传统和团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的优良作风。
    要加强领导。抓好总评中的活思想，反复说明今年四好总评的重大意义，端正对四好总评的态度。对评上四好、五好的，要教育他们谦虚谨慎，不断前进。对没有评上的，也要看到他们的进步，发扬他们的积极因素，勉励他们向先进看齐。
    让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在“斗私，批修”伟大方针指引下，为创造出更多、更好的四好连队、五好战士，为把我军真正办成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
    （十一月三十日）
