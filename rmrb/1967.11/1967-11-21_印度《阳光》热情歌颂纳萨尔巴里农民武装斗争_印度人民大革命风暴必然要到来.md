According to a Xinhua News Agency report from New Delhi: The Urdu-language monthly magazine "Sunshine" in its August-September issue published an article that warmly praises the Nasalbari revolutionary faction and their ongoing struggle. The article points out that the peasants of Nasalbari will surely win. A great revolutionary storm, in which the Indian people will rise up like a typhoon to defend their rights and overthrow the exploiters and their regime, is inevitably coming.

The article states that it is undeniable that no matter how much propaganda attacks are launched against the leaders of the Nasalbari peasant movement, the leaders of the Nasalbari peasant movement are genuine communists. They are not afraid of difficulties and resolutely support the oppressed people of Nasalbari, organizing and leading them in resistance against oppression.

The article says, "The peasants of Nasalbari will definitely achieve a brilliant victory. Because the communists are leading their movement, the victory will be more assured. Genuine communists are fearless and they do not avoid struggle."

The article refutes the slander of the bourgeois press and radio against the Nasalbari revolutionary faction. The article says, "The fact is that among the communists, those who are called 'extremists' and leftists are the genuine communists. Otherwise, why would the ruling class be so frightened of them? On the other hand, false communists would not make the ruling class afraid, because they pretend to be genuine communists, misleading the people, and are only protecting the interests of the exploiters."

The article says: If the Nasalbari movement is suppressed, its momentum will grow even stronger. If the exploiting class oppresses and massacres the people, then they will be driven off the stage of history by force.

The article points out: "Nasalbari is not an isolated place or an isolated incident; it has broad connections in India and the world, and one day it will surely succeed. In India, the people will also rise up like a typhoon to defend their rights and overthrow the exploiters and their regime. No one can stop this typhoon; the revolution is inevitably coming."

The article concludes by saying that no matter what force the defenders of the exploiters and their leader, American imperialism, use, they will not be able to suppress the revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    印度《阳光》热情歌颂纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争
    印度人民大革命风暴必然要到来
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：印度乌尔都文《阳光》月刊八—九月号刊登文章，热情歌颂纳萨尔巴里革命派和他们正在进行的斗争。文章指出，纳萨尔巴里的农民必将胜利。印度人民象飓风一样起来维护自己的权利、推翻剥削者和他们的政权的大革命风暴必然要到来。
    文章说，无可否认这个事实：不论对纳萨尔巴里的农民运动领导人进行什么攻击宣传，纳萨尔巴里农民运动的领导人是真正的共产党人。他们不怕困难，坚决支持纳萨尔巴里的被压迫人民，组织和领导他们反抗压迫。
    文章说，“纳萨尔巴里的农民肯定将取得光辉的胜利。由于共产党人在领导他们的运动，胜利将更有保证。真正的共产党人无所畏惧，他们也不逃避斗争。”
    文章驳斥了资产阶级报纸和电台对纳萨尔巴里革命派的诽谤。文章说，事实是，共产党人当中那些被称作“极端分子”和左派分子的人是真正的共产党人。否则，为什么统治阶级被他们吓坏了呢？另一方面，假共产党员不至于使统治阶级害怕，因为他们冒充真正的共产党人，迷惑老百姓，只是为了保护剥削者的利益。
    文章说：如果纳萨尔巴里运动遭到镇压，它的声势将越大。剥削阶级压迫和屠杀人民，那么，他们将被以武力赶下历史舞台。
    文章指出：“纳萨尔巴里不是一个孤立的地方或孤立的事件，它在印度和世界上有广泛的联系，有朝一日，它肯定将获得成功。”“在印度，人民也象飓风一样起来维护自己的权利、推翻剥削者和他们的政权。谁也制止不了这个飓风，革命必然到来。”
    文章最后说，不论剥削者的维护者和它们的头子美帝国主义使用什么武力，都不能把亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命镇压下去。
