Title: Struggle Against "Selfishness," Sweep Away Factionalism

Our department's realization of revolutionary unity based on administrative divisions went through a sharp ideological struggle. This was a process of eliminating bourgeois elements and establishing proletarian elements, of overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, all under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought. This was a very beneficial self-revolution for uprooting our petty-bourgeois factionalism and selfish thoughts.

In the process of achieving unity based on administrative divisions, the first problem we encountered was the fear that the other side would "swallow" our minority faction. Therefore, we firmly advocated that the two factional headquarters should unite first, believing that the other side's proposal to immediately achieve unity based on administrative divisions lacked conditions and that the steps were too hasty. Because we considered the issue from the perspective of factionalism, we suspected and rejected every move made by the other side. The more the other side emphasized something, the more we thought there was something behind it.

Through this period of practice in unity, especially through the study of criticizing selfishness and revisionism, we realized that the fear of being "swallowed" is wrong. Chairman Mao teaches us: "As long as both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary unity on the basis of revolutionary principles." "Swallowing" has class characteristics. In class struggle, is it the landlord swallowing the peasant, or the peasant swallowing the landlord? Is it the bourgeoisie swallowing the proletariat, or the proletariat swallowing the bourgeoisie? Here, there is a question of "swallowing." But our two factions are both revolutionary mass organizations, with the same general direction and goals, without fundamental conflicts of interest, and there is no question of one "swallowing" the other. If we must talk about "swallowing," it can only be the proletarian party spirit swallowing petty-bourgeois factionalism. Therefore, fundamentally, it is the "selfishness" at work, fearing that power will not be in the hands of our faction, fearing that after unity, we will not be at the core. This shows that we are not fighting for power for the revolution and for the proletariat, but for power for the individual and the small group. Chairman Mao has long pointed out this kind of thought with piercing insight: "Paying attention only to the interests of one's own small group and not to the interests of the whole, appearing to be for the collective but actually containing extremely narrow personal interests, also has great corrosive and centrifugal effects." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups." We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, act in the interests of the people, and fight for, seize, and use power for the proletariat.

Another active thought in revolutionary unity is the belief that unity is not possible without clarifying right and wrong. After the formation of the two factions in our department, due to factionalism, there was a lot of antagonism, and some comrades did not even speak to each other when they met. In this situation, before unity, we thought that unity was not possible without clarifying right and wrong; after unity, we thought that some issues of right and wrong were still not clarified, making unity unreliable and with the possibility of breaking up. In essence, it was still the "selfishness" at work. We emphasized clarifying right and wrong to prove that our general direction was correct, wanting to suppress the other side in the process of clarifying right and wrong and have our faction seize power. Through this period of study, we reviewed and realized that the issues of right and wrong between the two factions were basically issues of understanding. Although the two factions had different views on some individuals in power, they were not fundamental conflicts of interest. This is just as Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason to split into two irreconcilable factions." What is right and wrong has a standard. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest "right" is to closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle. Specifically, it is to promote revolutionary criticism, revolutionary unity, revolutionary three-in-one combination, and struggle-criticism-transformation. Going against this direction is the biggest "wrong." This big right and wrong must never be forgotten. The issues of right and wrong between our two factions, since they are issues of understanding, should we solve them by uniting or by splitting? Should we deal with petty-bourgeois factionalism with petty-bourgeois factionalism, or should we unite and solve them with proletarian party spirit? It is definitely better to solve them by uniting. For example, in our department, some leaders from the two factions had a lot of antagonism in the past. After this unity, the two sat together to study, quickly changing from backing each other up in "internal war" to facing each other and opening their hearts, becoming comrades fighting shoulder to shoulder. Without using Mao Zedong Thought to judge right and wrong, it will only deepen the differences and contradictions. When factionalism is dominant, the two factions often argue over a single slogan. When factionalism is removed, both sides find common ground, and some problems that were originally thought to be difficult to solve become easier to solve. This shows that in the disputes between revolutionary mass organizations, as long as everyone sits together, following the principle of speaking less about others' shortcomings and errors, and each doing more self-criticism and seeking common ground while reserving differences, many problems can be easily solved.

Chairman Mao's instruction to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism is the fundamental policy of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is also the fundamental policy for achieving, consolidating, and developing revolutionary unity based on systems. In the future, we must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, consciously use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, dare to engage in self-criticism, strictly demand of ourselves, and always be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

### 狠斗“私”字，横扫派性

    狠斗“私”字，横扫派性
    六机部大联委科技局勤务员　王光启  生产局勤务员　段蟠池
    我们六机部机关实现按行政部门的革命大联合，经历了一个尖锐的思想斗争的过程。这是在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下进行灭资兴无、破私立公的过程。这对铲除我们的小资产阶级派性和私心杂念来说，是一次很有益的自我革命。
    在实现按部门大联合中，首先碰到的问题，是怕对方“吃”掉我们这个少数派。所以，我们坚决主张两派总部首先联合，认为对方提出的马上实现按行政部门的大联合，不具备条件，步子走得太快了。由于自己从派性出发去考虑问题，对于对方的一举一动，都加以怀疑和排斥，对方愈强调什么，就愈认为这里有文章。
    通过这一段联合的实践，尤其是通过斗私批修的学习，我们认识到，怕别人“吃掉”这种思想是错误的。毛主席教导我们：“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”“吃掉”是有阶级性的。在阶级斗争中，是地主吃掉农民，还是农民吃掉地主？是资产阶级吃掉无产阶级，还是无产阶级吃掉资产阶级？这里是有“吃掉”的问题的。而我们两派都是革命的群众组织，大方向一致，目标一致，没有根本的利害冲突，根本不存在谁“吃掉”谁的问题。如果真要讲“吃掉”，那只能是无产阶级的党性吃掉小资产阶级的派性。所以，归根结底是“私”字作怪，怕权掌握不到我们这一派手里，怕联合后不能以我为核心。这说明了我们不是为革命争权和为无产阶级争权，而是为个人和小团体争权。对这种思想，毛主席早就一针见血地指出了：“只注意自己小团体的利益，不注意整体的利益，表面上不是为个人，实际上包含了极狭隘的个人主义，同样地具有很大的销蚀作用和离心作用。”毛主席教导我们：“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。我们要永远记住毛主席的这个教导，一切从人民的利益出发，为无产阶级争权、掌权和用权。
    在革命大联合中另一个活思想，就是认为不弄清是非，就没法联合。我们部的两派形成后，由于派性作怪，对立情绪很大，有的同志见面连话都不讲。在这种情况下，联合以前，我们认为是非问题没有弄清以前是谈不拢来的；联合以后，又认为有些是非问题还没弄清楚，联合不牢靠，还有破裂的可能。实质上，仍然是“私”字作怪。我们强调弄清是非的目的，是为了证明我们的大方向是正确的，想要在弄清是非过程中把对方压下去，由我们这一派来掌权。通过这段学习，我们回顾了一下，认识到两派之间的是非问题，基本上是属于认识问题。虽然两派对个别当权派有不同看法，但也不是根本的利害冲突。这正如毛主席教导我们的那样：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”所谓是非，是有标准的。在文化大革命运动中最大的“是”，就是紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢地掌握革命斗争的大方向。当前具体讲来，就是要促进革命的大批判、革命的大联合、革命的三结合和斗批改。违背这个大方向就是最大的“非”。这个大是大非任何时候都不能忘掉。我们两派之间存在的是非问题，既然是属于认识问题，那么，对这些问题，是联合起来解决好呢？还是分裂起来解决好呢？是以小资产阶级派性对付小资产阶级派性好呢？还是联合起来用无产阶级党性解决好呢？肯定是联合起来解决好。例如，我们部机关里两派中个别头头，过去对立情绪很大。这次联合后，两人坐在一起学习，很快就变为由过去背靠背打“内战”，到面对面交心，成了肩并肩战斗的战友。不用毛泽东思想去鉴别是非，只会加深分歧和矛盾。当派性占主要地位的时候，两派往往为一个口号，都会发生争论。当派性去掉以后，双方找到了共同点，一些原来认为很难解决的问题，也容易解决了。这里说明，在革命群众组织之间的争论，只要大家坐到一起，本着少讲别人的缺点错误，各自多作自我批评和求大同存小异的原则，这样许多问题就容易解决了。
    毛主席关于要斗私，批修的指示，是无产阶级文化大革命的根本方针，也是实现、巩固和发展按照系统实行革命大联合的根本方针。今后，我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，勇于自我批评，严格要求自己，永远忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
