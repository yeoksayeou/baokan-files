Chairman Mao teaches us: "Communist Party members must ask 'why' about everything." From the black words of the Chinese Khrushchev's revisionist line on labor, we raise a few questions for everyone to think about and discuss:

1. Our country has leaped from a semi-feudal, semi-colonial state to an advanced socialist country. What is the basis for this great leap forward in our society? What has driven each production peak over the past eighteen years since the founding of the nation? Is it really due to the development of production technology?

2. Did the Soviet Union transform from Tsarist Russia into a socialist country through technological advancement? Now, has the Soviet Union reverted to revisionism due to technological regression?

3. What is the essence of the statement, "Our only demand of workers is to produce well"? Why does the Chinese Khrushchev urge workers to "struggle for advanced technology and advanced quotas"?

4. The Chinese Khrushchev says: "If someone truly has a skill, truly has a creation, truly has an invention, regardless of other aspects, they can be a hero or a model." Whose "heroes" and "models" are these? "Producing well is the same as being politically good"—whose "politics" is this?

5. The Chinese Khrushchev also says: Advanced producers are "the vanguards of human society's forward development," and will become "great figures of the state" and "great figures of the nation." He emphasizes that labor models should be "fully rewarded." What path does this lead workers down? What is the purpose of a revolutionary worker's life?

    五个为什么？大家来想一想，议一议
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么”。我们从中国赫鲁晓夫修正主义工运路线的黑话里，提出几个问题，请大家来想一想、议一议：
    一、我国从一个半封建、半殖民地的国家，一跃而为社会主义的先进国家。我国社会的这个飞跃发展，究竟靠的是什么？建国十八年来每次生产高潮的出现，又是靠的什么？难道是靠生产技术发展的推动吗？
    二、苏联从沙皇俄国变为社会主义国家，是靠的技术推动吗？现在，苏联又从社会主义变为修正主义，这是因为技术倒退的结果吗？
    三、“我们对工人的唯一要求是：生产好”，这种说法的实质是什么？中国赫鲁晓夫要工人为“先进的技术和先进的定额而斗争”，究竟是为了什么？
    四、中国赫鲁晓夫说：“如果真有一门本事，真有一种创造，真有一种发明，不管其他好不好，就可以是英雄或者是模范”，这是谁家的“英雄”“模范”？“生产好就是政治好”，这是哪个阶级的“政治”？
    五、中国赫鲁晓夫又说：先进生产者是“人类社会历史向前发展的先驱”，将要成为“国家的大人物”、“民族的大人物”，还强调对劳模要“给予充分的奖励”，这究竟要把工人引到什么道路上去？我们一个革命的工人活着究竟为了什么？
