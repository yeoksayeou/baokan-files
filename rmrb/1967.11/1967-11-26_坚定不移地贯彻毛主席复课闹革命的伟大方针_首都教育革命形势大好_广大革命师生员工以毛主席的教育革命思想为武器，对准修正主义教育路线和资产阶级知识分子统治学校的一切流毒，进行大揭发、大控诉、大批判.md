The great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian educational revolution, "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," have greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools in the capital. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts, the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire city are now, with unparalleled fighting spirit, throwing themselves into the great torrent of the proletarian educational revolution, striving to become proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Thousands of primary schools, hundreds of secondary schools, and dozens of institutions of higher learning that have resumed classes and are making revolution are presenting a new scene of educational revolution.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on educational revolution are the guiding principles for carrying out the educational revolution. The revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools in the capital have, in the educational revolution, first of all, studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian educational revolution, the "May 7th Directive," and Chairman Mao's works on the proletarian education. They study them every day and apply them every day. The more they study, the clearer their direction becomes, and the higher their revolutionary consciousness becomes. Many revolutionary teachers and students have said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively put forward the unprecedented, most complete, and most scientific proletarian educational revolutionary thoughts, lines, and policies in human history. We are carrying out this great proletarian educational revolution to fully implement Chairman Mao's proletarian educational thoughts. They consult Chairman Mao's works whenever they encounter problems in the educational revolution, determined to make the educational revolution advance victoriously along the path pointed out by Chairman Mao.

With Chairman Mao's thoughts on educational revolution as their weapon, the revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools in the capital have launched a great exposure, denunciation, and criticism of the revisionist educational line, the bourgeois educational system, and all the poisonous influences of the bourgeois intellectuals' domination of the schools. The scope of the revolutionary criticism has covered literature, history, philosophy, education, and even economics, industry, and agriculture, and has gradually deepened to the educational line, educational system, educational structure, and all the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeois academic "authorities." The practice of struggle has made the revolutionary teachers and students more deeply realize that the proletarian educational revolution is a sharp struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. Without thoroughly criticizing the revisionist educational line, this revolution cannot be carried out well.

In the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students have thoroughly exposed the various crimes of the bourgeois educational system: teaching is separated from productive labor, from the working people, and from class struggle; the school system is long, the courses are many, and the homework is heavy; from concept to concept, the more one studies, the more one becomes a bookworm; and the emphasis on grades, teaching without educating, and so on. They have further exposed the cover of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads on the educational front over the past seventeen years.

Recently, some schools in the capital have had heated discussions on issues such as whether to carry out revolution or reform, whether to resume revolutionary courses or professional courses first, and on whom the proletarian educational revolution should rely. These discussions have touched the soul and triggered fierce ideological struggles. Every teaching reform plan, every educational revolutionary scheme, and every major teaching reform measure are struggles between two roads, two lines, and two methods, and are struggles between the public and the private. The experiences of schools like Caochangdi Middle School and Shijingshan Middle School, which have done a good job in resuming classes and making revolution and in the educational revolution, all prove this point. Through the struggle to criticize and repudiate revisionism, these schools have established new types of teacher-student relationships in the educational revolution, where teachers and students study together, fight together, exercise together, labor together, and entertain together; they promote each other politically, help each other ideologically, learn from each other in teaching, and care for each other in life. Some teachers initially had difficulties participating in the educational revolution, fearing risks and heavy responsibilities, but after the struggle to criticize and repudiate revisionism, they have become pioneers of the educational revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The people have limitless creative power," "the masses are the real heroes," and "correct ideas can only come from social practice, only from the three kinds of social practice—production struggle, class struggle, and scientific experiment." The facts of many schools that have achieved success in resuming classes and making revolution in the capital prove that only by mobilizing the masses can we form a surging educational revolutionary army; only in the practice of revolutionary criticism can we deeply understand the crimes of the revisionist educational line and the bourgeois intellectuals' domination of the schools, and raise class consciousness; only in the practice of teaching reform can we know what to struggle against, what to criticize, what to change, and how to struggle, how to criticize, and how to change; only in the practice of the educational revolution, through the masses' investigation, discussion, revolution, and creation, can we deeply understand Chairman Mao's thoughts on the educational revolution and complete the great historical task of the proletarian educational revolution.

The realization and consolidation of the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination are important guarantees for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. The development of the educational revolutionary movement in various schools in the capital is unbalanced. Those that have achieved revolutionary great alliances, especially those that have achieved revolutionary three-in-one combinations and established revolutionary committees, have resumed classes and made revolution earlier and better, and the educational revolutionary mass movement is both vigorous and solid. The key is that in these schools, a powerful leading core composed of proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end has been formed, and the leadership of the educational revolution is firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries. With a leading cadre that has proletarian authority, it is easier to distinguish the direction in the face of sharp and complex struggles and to advance along the correct path. It is easier to concentrate the wisdom of the masses, unify the steps and plans of the movement, and make the movement develop rapidly and avoid detours. It is also possible to timely discover and enthusiastically support new things.

At present, the broad proletarian revolutionaries of primary and secondary schools in the capital are, while actively carrying out the educational revolution, following Chairman Mao's latest instructions to further develop, strengthen, and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, creating better conditions for carrying out the proletarian educational revolution.

    坚定不移地贯彻毛主席复课闹革命的伟大方针
    首都教育革命形势大好
    广大革命师生员工以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，对准修正主义教育路线和资产阶级知识分子统治学校的一切流毒，进行大揭发、大控诉、大批判
    据新华社二十五日讯  本社记者述评：我们伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，极大地鼓舞了首都大、中、小学革命师生员工。在毛主席的光辉思想指引下，全市广大革命师生员工正以无比昂扬的战斗姿态投身到伟大的无产阶级教育革命洪流中去，争当决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。陆续复课闹革命的数千所小学、数百所中学和数十所高等学校，出现了一派教育革命的新景象。
    毛主席教育革命的光辉思想是进行教育革命的指针
    首都大中小学广大革命师生员工在教育革命中，头一件大事就是大学大用毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示、“五·七”指示，以及毛主席论述无产阶级教育的有关著作。他们天天学，天天用。越学方向越明，革命的自觉性越高。许多革命师生员工说，伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地提出了人类历史上空前的、最完整、最科学的无产阶级教育革命思想、路线和方针。我们进行这场伟大的无产阶级教育革命，就是要不折不扣地实现毛主席的无产阶级教育思想。他们在教育革命中，碰到问题就向毛主席著作请教，决心使教育革命沿着毛主席指出的道路胜利向前发展。
    批深批透中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线
    首都大、中、小学广大革命师生员工以毛主席的教育革命思想为武器，对准修正主义教育路线、资产阶级教育制度和资产阶级知识分子统治学校的一切流毒，进行大揭发、大控诉、大批判。革命大批判的范围涉及到文史、哲学、教育，以至经济、工业、农业等方面，并逐步深入发展到教育路线、教育制度、教育体制，以及资产阶级反动学术“权威”的一切反动思想。斗争的实践使广大革命师生员工更深刻地认识到，无产阶级教育革命是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的尖锐斗争。不把修正主义教育路线彻底批透，这场革命是搞不好的。
    广大革命师生员工在革命大批判中，大摆资产阶级教育制度的种种罪恶：教学脱离生产劳动、脱离劳动人民、脱离社会阶级斗争；学制长，课程多，作业重；从概念到概念，越学书生气越重；以及分数挂帅、教书不教人等等，进一步深入揭开了十七年来教育战线上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子。
    在教育革命中破私立公，改造世界观
    最近首都一些学校的革命师生就革命还是改良、先复革命课还是先复业务课、无产阶级教育革命是依靠谁等问题，展开了热烈的讨论，触动了灵魂，引起思想上剧烈的斗争。一次教改计划的讨论，一个教育革命方案的诞生，一个重大教改措施的出现，都是两条道路、两条路线、两种方法的斗争，都是一场公与私的斗争。草场地中学、石景山中学等一批复课闹革命、教育革命搞得比较好的学校的经验都说明了这一点。通过斗私批修，这些学校在教育革命中建立了新型的师生关系，教师和学生同学习、同战斗、同出操、同劳动、同娱乐；在政治上互相促进，思想上互相帮助，教学上互相学习，生活上互相关心。有的教师开始时参加教育革命有畏难情绪，怕担风险，怕挑重担，经过破私立公的斗争，他们变成教育革命的闯将。
    走群众路线，充分发扬革命学生、革命教员、革命工人的创造精神
    毛主席教导我们“人民群众有无限的创造力”，“群众是真正的英雄”，“人的正确思想，只能从社会实践中来，只能从社会的生产斗争、阶级斗争和科学实验这三项实践中来。”首都许多在复课闹革命中取得了成就的学校的事实说明，只有放手发动群众，才能组成浩浩荡荡的教育革命大军；只有在革命大批判的实践中，才能深刻认识修正主义教育路线和资产阶级知识分子统治学校的种种罪行，提高阶级觉悟；只有在教学改革的实践中，才知道斗什么，批什么，改什么和怎么斗，怎么批，怎么改；只有在教育革命的实践中，经过群众的调查、讨论、革命和创造，才能深刻领会毛主席的教育革命的思想，完成无产阶级教育革命的伟大历史任务。
    实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，是进行无产阶级教育革命的重要保证
    首都各学校的教育革命运动发展是不平衡的。实现了革命大联合的，特别是实现了革命三结合，成立了革命委员会的学校，复课闹革命就搞得早，搞得好，教育革命的群众运动既轰轰烈烈又扎扎实实。其关键就是因为在这些学校里已经形成了一个由决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派组成的强有力的领导核心，教育革命的领导权牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手中。有一个有无产阶级权威的领导班子，在尖锐、复杂的斗争面前，就易于辨别方向，沿着正确的道路前进。就易于集中群众的智慧，统一运动的步骤和计划，使运动迅速地向前发展，少走弯路。也就能及时发现和热情支持新生事物。
    目前，首都大中小学的广大无产阶级革命派在积极开展教育革命的同时，正在遵循毛主席的最新指示，进一步发展、加强和巩固革命的大联合和革命的三结合，为进行无产阶级教育革命创造更好的条件。
