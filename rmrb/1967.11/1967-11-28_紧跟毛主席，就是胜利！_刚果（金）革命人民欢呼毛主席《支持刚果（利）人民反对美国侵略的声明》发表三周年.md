When the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, issued his declaration "Support the Congolese (Leopoldville) People in Their Struggle Against U.S. Aggression" (November 28, 1964), it was the third anniversary. The revolutionary people and fighters of the Congo (Kinshasa) were filled with revolutionary fervor and enthusiastically hailed this great historical document by Chairman Mao. They praised the declaration as "pointing out the correct path for the Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionary people to achieve national liberation," as a "stirring battle cry," and as "indispensable sustenance for all revolutionaries." They said it has great significance for the Congolese (Kinshasa) people's current struggle. In their practical struggle, they have felt that great Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon for defeating imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and for carrying the world revolution through to the end. They expressed their determination to forever follow Chairman Mao and carry the revolution through to the end. They shouted, "Long live our great leader, the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!"

A Stirring Battle Cry

Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionary fighter N. Nzengu told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao Zedong's declaration is deeply engraved in the minds of the revolutionary people of all countries, especially the Congolese (Kinshasa) people." Another fighter, P. Makaya, said, "Chairman Mao's declaration not only points out the path to victory for our people but also for the people of all African countries." Congolese (Kinshasa) friend O. Kantesa said, "Chairman Mao's declaration is a stirring battle cry. The revolutionary people of the world who respond to Chairman Mao's call must unite and thoroughly defeat the American imperialists and their lackeys and running dogs."

Another Congolese (Kinshasa) friend named M. Filipo said: Chairman Mao, in this declaration, calls on the people of the world to dare to struggle and have the determination to defeat imperialism. Chairman Mao also points out to the African people and the people of the world the practical measures to eliminate the imperialist devil, strengthen national unity, and persist in long-term struggle. For fighters struggling for national independence and justice, and against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries, this is a great source of inspiration. He excitedly said, "My admiration for Chairman Mao is indescribable."

The Countryside and Forests Are Our Base

In the armed struggle against American imperialism and its lackey Mobutu, Congolese (Kinshasa) fighters have deeply felt that Chairman Mao's teachings on people's war are their guiding light. Chairman Mao's declaration inspires them to advance bravely. They expressed their determination to persist in armed struggle to achieve final victory.

A friend, K. Theodore, emphasized, "To defeat American imperialism and all reactionaries, the revolutionary people of all countries must deeply understand the content of Chairman Mao Zedong's works on people's war. Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of armed struggle." He quoted a saying of Chairman Mao: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on the masses." He continued, "The countryside and forests are our base. The vast peasantry stands on our side. Relying on the peasants and establishing rural bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally taking the cities—this is the path of victory of the Chinese revolution, and this is the path we must take." He finally said, "Chairman Mao's declaration has great significance for our current struggle. Although our struggle has twists and turns, our determination to win victory is firmer than ever. Revolutionary armed struggle will surely win victory in the Congo (Kinshasa)."

The U.S. is the Number One Enemy, and the Soviet Revisionists Are the U.S. Lackeys

A Congolese (Kinshasa) student named A. Mudangala said: Chairman Mao's declaration teaches us to identify who our enemies are and who our friends are. Another Congolese (Kinshasa) fighter excitedly told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "As Chairman Mao said, 'American imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world.'"

In the struggle against American imperialism and for national independence, the revolutionary fighters and people of the Congo (Kinshasa) have increasingly exposed the true face of the Soviet revisionists betraying the revolutionary people of all countries. A fighter from the western front, M. Gigobert, said, "Wherever American imperialism carries out aggression in the world, it gets open or covert support from the Soviet revisionists. For some countries engaged in anti-imperialist struggle, the Soviet revisionists advocate ceasefire or negotiations favorable to American imperialism." Another Congolese (Kinshasa) friend named M. Nicholas pointed out, "The great leader of the world revolution, Chairman Mao Zedong, teaches us: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' but the Soviet revisionists have been playing tricks, advocating peaceful coexistence and advocating surrender to American imperialism. They are obstructing the world revolution in this way."

A friend named E. Vincent emphasized, "The revolutionary people of all countries struggling against imperialism and for national independence must not harbor any illusions about the military 'aid' or economic 'aid' from the Soviet revisionists. The situation of the brotherly Arab people being betrayed by this gang of lackeys of American imperialism is a clear example."

A Congolese (Kinshasa) fighter named E. Dissisa said, as Chairman Mao pointed out, the just struggle of the Congolese people is not isolated. He continued, "Indeed, all the people of China support us. All people opposing imperialism also support us."

Follow Chairman Mao and Defeat the U.S. for Sure

A Congolese (Kinshasa) friend named Joseph told a Xinhua News Agency reporter, "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. He aids all revolutionary people of the world who struggle against imperialism. He has inspired the people of the world to struggle, overcome all difficulties, and eliminate all paper tigers. The lofty Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory." He also expressed his determination to study Chairman Mao's works seriously, become a good student of Chairman Mao, and propagate the invincible Mao Zedong Thought everywhere.

A fighter from the western front of the Congo (Kinshasa) named Jean-Baptiste said, "What I have understood from Chairman Mao's declaration is: the lofty and correct Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible weapon for defeating imperialism and all reactionaries and for carrying the world revolution through to the end." He emphasized, "Follow Chairman Mao and that is victory! Follow Chairman Mao and American imperialism will surely be defeated!"

Several Congolese (Kinshasa) friends, at the end of their conversation with the Xinhua News Agency reporter, shouted, "Long live great Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader, the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao!"

    紧跟毛主席，就是胜利！
    ——刚果（金）革命人民欢呼毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年
    当全世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》（一九六四年十一月二十八日）发表三周年的时候，刚果（金）的革命人民和革命战士满怀革命激情，热烈欢呼毛主席的这个伟大的历史文件。他们赞扬这个声明“给刚果（金）革命人民指明了争取民族解放的正确道路”，它是“振奋人心的战斗号召”，“所有革命者的不可缺少的粮食”，它对刚果（金）人民“当前的斗争实践具有重大意义”。他们在斗争实践中体会到：伟大的毛泽东思想是打败帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，把世界革命进行到底的威力无比的武器。他们表示决心要永远紧跟毛主席，把革命进行到底。他们高呼：“我们的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！”
    振奋人心的战斗号召
    刚果（金）革命战士诺·恩真谷向新华社记者强调说：“毛泽东主席的声明牢牢地印在世界各国革命人民，特别是刚果（金）人民的脑子里。”另一位战士皮·马卡雅说：“毛主席的声明不仅给我国人民，而且给非洲各国人民指明了胜利的道路。”刚果（金）朋友奥·康特萨说：“毛主席的声明是振奋人心的战斗号召。响应毛主席的号召的全世界革命人民，必须团结起来，彻底打败美帝国主义者及其帮凶和走狗。”
    另一位名叫米·菲利珀的刚果（金）朋友说：毛主席在这个声明中号召全世界人民敢于斗争和具有打败帝国主义的决心。毛主席还向非洲人民和全世界人民指出了消灭帝国主义恶魔、加强民族团结和坚持长期斗争的切实的措施。对于为争取民族独立和正义，为反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和反动派而斗争的战士来说，这是使他们受到鼓舞的伟大泉源。他激动地说：“我对毛主席的爱戴之情，是无法用言辞来表达的。”
    农村和森林是我们的根据地
    刚果（金）战士在反对美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托的武装斗争中，深刻体会到毛主席关于人民战争的教导是他们的指路明灯。毛主席声明鼓舞他们奋勇前进。他们表示要坚持武装斗争以赢得最后胜利。
    一位朋友基·特奥多勒强调指出：“要打败美帝国主义和一切反动派，各国革命人民必须深刻领会毛泽东主席关于人民战争的著作的内容。毛泽东思想照亮了武装斗争的道路。”他引用了毛主席的一条语录：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他接着说：农村和森林是我们的根据地，广大的农民都站在我们一边。依靠农民和建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市，这是中国革命获得胜利的道路，这也是我们必须走的道路。他最后表示：“毛主席的声明对于我们当前的斗争实践具有重大的意义。尽管我们的斗争有曲折和反复，但是我们夺取胜利的决心比以往任何时候更加坚定，革命的武装斗争必将在刚果（金）赢得胜利。”
    美帝是头号敌人  苏修是美帝帮凶
    一位名叫阿·穆丹加拉的刚果（金）学生说：毛主席的声明教导我们识别谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友。另一位刚果（金）战士激动地对新华社记者说：“正象毛主席所说的那样，‘美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。’”
    刚果（金）的革命战士和革命人民在反对美帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争中，越来越清楚地识破了苏联修正主义者背叛各国革命人民的真面目。西线的一位战士马·吉戈贝尔说：“美帝国主义无论在全世界什么地方进行侵略，都得到苏联修正主义者公开或隐蔽的支持。对于进行反帝斗争的一些国家的人民，苏联修正主义者要他们停火或者进行有利于美帝国主义的和谈。”另外一位名叫马·尼古拉斯的刚果（金）朋友指出：“世界革命的伟大领袖毛泽东主席教导我们说：‘枪杆子里面出政权’，而苏联修正主义者却一直在玩弄骗局，鼓吹和平共处，鼓吹向美帝国主义屈膝投降。他们这样做，就是在阻挠世界革命。”
    一位名叫埃·樊尚的朋友着重指出：“为反对帝国主义、争取民族独立而斗争的世界各国革命人民，决不能对苏联修正主义者的军事‘援助’或经济‘援助’存什么幻想，兄弟的阿拉伯人民被美帝国主义者的这伙帮凶出卖的情况，就是一个明显的例子。”
    一位名叫埃·迪西萨的刚果（金）战士说，正如毛主席所指出的，刚果人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。他接着说：“的确，全中国人民支持我们。一切反对帝国主义的人民也支持我们。”
    紧跟毛主席就一定能打败美帝
    一位名叫约瑟夫的刚果（金）朋友对新华社记者说：“毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛主席是全世界革命人民的伟大领袖。他援助全世界所有同帝国主义作斗争的革命人民。他鼓起了全世界人民的勇气，激励他们投入斗争，克服种种困难，来消灭所有的纸老虎。崇高的毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”他还表示今后要认真学习毛主席的著作，使自己成为毛主席的好学生，并且要到处宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    来自刚果（金）西线的一位名叫让·巴普蒂斯特的战士说：“我从毛主席声明中体会到的是：崇高而正确的毛泽东思想，是打败帝国主义和一切反动派，把世界革命进行到底的威力无比的武器。”他着重指出：“紧跟毛主席就是胜利！紧跟毛主席，就一定能打败美帝国主义者。”
    几位刚果（金）朋友在结束同新华社记者的谈话时，高呼：“伟大的毛泽东思想万岁！”“我们的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！”　　　　　·新华社记者·
