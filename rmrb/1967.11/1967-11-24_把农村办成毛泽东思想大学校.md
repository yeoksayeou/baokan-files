The article “The Struggle Between Two Lines in China’s Countryside” published in the *People’s Daily*, *Red Flag* magazine, and *Liberation Army Daily* is truly excellent! It deeply exposes the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by China’s Khrushchev in our countryside, where they suppress the poor and lower-middle peasants, advocate for the capitalist road, and attempt to sabotage the socialist revolution in the countryside. It declares the complete failure of these counter-revolutionary revisionists’ conspiracy to restore capitalism in the countryside!

Our great leader Chairman Mao has always taught us after leading the Chinese people to seize power nationwide: “At any time, we must not forget class struggle, we must not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must not forget to rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, we must not forget the Party’s policies, and we must not forget the Party’s work.” He has also led the Chinese people in carrying out the socialist revolution. However, China’s Khrushchev, driven by his counter-revolutionary revisionist instincts, fiercely opposes the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao. Together with another top capitalist-roader within the Party, he slashes agricultural cooperatives, promotes the “three freedoms and one contract,” spreads the wind of individual farming, and brutally suppresses the socialist education movement in the countryside. They always represent the interests of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, and always strike at the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres. They are the ones who undermine the socialist collective economy.

In the more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries have gone deep into the countryside and among the poor and lower-middle peasants. We have learned about the serious consequences that China’s Khrushchev’s entire capitalist line has brought to the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. His entire capitalist line in the countryside has caused great indignation among the poor and lower-middle peasants. He is the mortal enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants! He is a thorough counter-revolutionary!

Our great leader Chairman Mao said at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee: “To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this.” This China’s Khrushchev not only promotes the capitalist line in the countryside but also openly peddles revisionist goods in agricultural education. He attempts to turn agricultural universities into bases for cultivating bourgeois intellectuals, into schools for cultivating revisionist cadres to restore capitalism in the countryside, and to lead the youth astray!

Under the protection of China’s Khrushchev, for the past eighteen years, the agricultural university has been ruled by bourgeois intellectuals. In the school, the children of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have been brutally suppressed. In recent years, they have waved the “red flag” to oppose the red flag, promoting the revisionist educational line and cultivating bourgeois spiritual aristocrats. The revolutionary teachers and students of the agricultural university have deeply suffered from their poisoning and hate them to the bone!

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is like a storm, swiftly destroying all the counter-revolutionary plots of China’s Khrushchev. The magnificent proletarian educational revolution underway is a strategic measure to thoroughly bury the revisionist educational line. We must be “revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end,” resolutely follow Chairman Mao’s words, take Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, and with “criticizing revisionism and repudiating self” as our guideline, fiercely criticize China’s Khrushchev’s bourgeois reactionary line in agricultural education and eliminate its poison. We are determined to take the agricultural university to the five hundred million peasants, thoroughly reform ourselves in the practical struggle between the two lines in the countryside, become good descendants of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, carry the cultural revolution in the countryside to the end and strive to turn our country’s countryside into a university of Mao Zedong Thought!

    把农村办成毛泽东思想大学校
    北京农业大学革命委员会
    《人民日报》、《红旗》杂志、《解放军报》编辑部的文章《中国农村两条道路的斗争》，写得何等好啊！它深刻地揭露了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资派在我国农村打击贫下中农，鼓吹走资本主义道路，妄图破坏农村社会主义革命的滔天罪行，宣告了这群反革命修正主义分子企图在农村复辟资本主义阴谋的彻底破产！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席领导中国人民在全国夺取政权以后，经常教导我们：“任何时候都不可忘记阶级斗争，不可忘记无产阶级专政，不可忘记依靠贫农、下中农，不可忘记党的政策，不可忘记党的工作。”他老人家又领导着中国人民进行了社会主义革命。但是中国赫鲁晓夫，出自他反革命修正主义的本能，疯狂对抗我们伟大领袖毛主席的指示，伙同党内另一个最大的走资派，大砍农业合作社，推行“三自一包”，大刮单干风，残酷地镇压农村社教运动。他们处处代表的是地、富、反、坏、右的利益，时时打击的是贫下中农和革命的干部，他们所瓦解的是社会主义集体经济。
    在一年多以来的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派，深入农村，深入贫下中农，了解中国赫鲁晓夫在农村推行的一整套资本主义路线给广大贫下中农带来的严重恶果。他在农村推行的一整套资本主义路线，引起贫下中农极大的愤慨，他是贫下中农不共戴天的死敌！他是个地地道道的老反革命！
    伟大领袖毛主席在党的八届十中全会上说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”这个中国赫鲁晓夫，不但在农村推行资本主义路线，而且在农业教育方面，也公开地贩卖修正主义黑货，企图把农业大学变成培养资产阶级知识分子的基地，变成他培养修正主义干部，在农村复辟资本主义的学校，把青年引向歧途！
    在中国赫鲁晓夫的一手庇护下，十八年来农业大学一直被资产阶级知识分子统治着。在学校中，广大贫下中农子女遭到他们残酷的打击。近几年来，他们又打着“红旗”反红旗，推行修正主义教育路线，培养资产阶级精神贵族。农业大学广大革命师生深受其毒害，无不恨之入骨！
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，象狂风暴雨一样，迅速地摧毁了中国赫鲁晓夫全部反革命阴谋。现在进行着的轰轰烈烈的无产阶级教育革命，是彻底埋葬修正主义教育路线的战略性措施。我们要争当“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，坚决听毛主席的话，以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫在农业教育战线上的资产阶级反动路线，肃清其流毒。我们决心把农业大学办到五亿农民中间去，在农村两条路线斗争的实践中，彻底改造自己，做贫下中农的好后代，同广大贫下中农一起，把农村文化大革命进行到底，为把我国农村变成毛泽东思想的大学校而奋斗！
