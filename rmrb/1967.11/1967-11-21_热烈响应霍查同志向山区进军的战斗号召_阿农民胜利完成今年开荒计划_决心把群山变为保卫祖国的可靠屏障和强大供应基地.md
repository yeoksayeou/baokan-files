Albanian farmers have triumphantly completed this year's land reclamation plan and are determined to turn the mountains into a reliable shield for defending the motherland and a powerful supply base.

Albanian peasants have enthusiastically responded to Comrade Enver Hoxha's call to "march into the hills and mountains, beautify the hills and mountains, and make them as fertile as the plains." They have successfully completed this year's land reclamation plan.

Albania regards the extensive development of land reclamation as an important task for developing agricultural production. Under the inspiration of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor, the broad masses of agricultural workers have displayed tremendous revolutionary enthusiasm. After successfully completing last year's land reclamation plan, they have reclaimed 22,891 hectares of wasteland from January to September this year, completing 101% of this year's land reclamation plan.

Due to extensive land reclamation and the planting of various grain crops, the grain output of many agricultural production cooperatives has significantly increased this year. The Tepelena District has completed 200% of its land reclamation plan this year, with the area of reclaimed land increasing by three times compared to last year. The terraced fields in the style of China's Dazhai are spread throughout the district, and all villages in the district have achieved grain self-sufficiency this year. The broad masses of workers in the districts of Saranda, Shkodra, and Kukes have also highly carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, extensively reclaimed land, expanded the area of grain crop sowing, strengthened field management, and are determined to turn Albania's mountains into a reliable shield for defending the motherland and a powerful supply base for the people and the armed forces.

    热烈响应霍查同志向山区进军的战斗号召
    阿农民胜利完成今年开荒计划
    决心把群山变为保卫祖国的可靠屏障和强大供应基地
    阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者热烈响应霍查同志的“向丘陵和山区进军，美化丘陵和山区，使它变得象平原一样富饶”的战斗号召，胜利地完成了今年的开荒计划。
    阿尔巴尼亚把大力开展开荒运动作为发展农业生产的一项重要任务。在劳动党第五次代表大会决议的鼓舞下，广大农业劳动者发挥冲天的革命干劲，继胜利完成去年的开荒计划以后，又在一到九月份开垦荒地二万二千八百九十一公顷，完成今年开荒计划的百分之一百零一。
    由于大力开荒和多种粮食作物，今年许多农业生产合作社的粮食产量显著提高，台佩莱纳区今年完成开荒计划的百分之二百，开荒面积比去年增加了三倍，中国大寨式的梯田遍布全区各地，全区所有农村在今年以内做到了粮食自给。萨兰达、斯库台、库克斯等区的广大劳动者，也高度发扬自力更生的革命精神，大力开荒，扩大粮食作物播种面积，加强田间管理，决心把阿尔巴尼亚的群山变为保卫祖国的可靠屏障和人民与武装力量的强大供应基地。
