Amateur artists from Tirana, the capital of Albania, known as the "Land of Eagles," performed in Shanghai today. The performance by the Tirana amateur art troupe, which carries the slogan "One hand with a pickaxe, one hand with a gun," was met with enthusiastic applause from the revolutionary people of Shanghai. The troupe's performance, filled with revolutionary passion and fighting camaraderie, was highly praised.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, including Liao Zhengguo, attended the performance and met with the troupe's leader, Mu Gerqali, and other key members during the intermission.

As the performance began, the curtain displayed the radiant images of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, sparking a wave of excitement throughout the audience. The Albanian artists held up the flags of both China and Albania, singing "The Labor Party—The Heroic Party" and "The East is Red" with full voices.

During the performance, the Albanian artists sang several songs in Chinese that praised the great leader Chairman Mao and songs composed based on Chairman Mao's quotations, which were enthusiastically received by the audience. Composer A. Mura sang his own composition, "Praising Chairman Mao's First Big-Character Poster," with great emotion. The singer's passionate performance elicited round after round of enthusiastic applause from the audience. The Albanian artists also sang "Song of Sino-Albanian Friendship" and "Praising the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party," and performed dances such as "Building the Motherland, Defending the Motherland." These songs and dances enthusiastically praised the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania and reflected the great achievements of Albania's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

After the performance, the entire audience repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Mao Zedong—Enver," "Enver—Mao Zedong," "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!"

The troupe arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou on the 26th.
