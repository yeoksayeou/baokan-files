The revolution criticism deepens, the revolutionary great alliance develops, and the situation on the Wuhan industrial front is excellent. Revolutionary workers are striving to be models of seizing the revolution and promoting production, correctly treating cadres, and correctly treating the masses who have been deceived, organizing tens of millions of people into the revolutionary ranks.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan, the broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres on the Wuhan industrial front are resolutely implementing the policy of "seizing the revolution and promoting production" proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao, uniting the broad masses, believing in and relying on the majority of cadres, and working together with them to ensure the rapid development of production. Since August, the production in many factories has been higher every day, higher every ten days, and higher every month. Many factories have broken historical records in daily production levels. Important products such as steel, iron, steel materials, machine tools, refrigeration machines, dyed fabrics, enamel products, paper, and batteries have seen significant increases in production.

Where the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is well carried out, there will surely be a new high tide of production. Recently, the reporter visited many factories in Wuhan and saw a thriving scene of revolution and production everywhere. Revolutionary workers study Chairman Mao's works before and after shifts, sing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, and discuss the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They work in shifts to produce, engage in revolution in their spare time, and cooperate during work intervals. In the workshops, the newly elected members of the revolutionary committees, the responsible persons of various revolutionary mass organizations, and the broad masses of cadres work and study with the workers. With the deepening of the revolutionary criticism, the fighting spirit of the broad revolutionary workers is more ardent. Various factories and mines have continuously achieved victories in technological innovation and technological revolution, and the news of breaking new records and creating new achievements is frequently reported.

In the unprecedented good revolutionary situation, the broad masses of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres in many factories and enterprises in the Wuhan region, with the line of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," are fighting against the "self" in their minds, achieving revolutionary great unity by factory, which is an important factor in achieving double victories in revolution and production. Many factories have established or are in the process of establishing revolutionary committees. The broad revolutionary workers in these factories and enterprises are all firmly guarding their posts and striving to be models of seizing the revolution and promoting production. Cooperation between workshops, between teams, and between upstream and downstream processes has been greatly strengthened.

Correctly treating cadres and correctly treating the broad masses who have been deceived is another important factor in the current struggle to achieve double victories in revolution and production in the Wuhan industrial sector. In the struggle to "seize the revolution and promote production," the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Wuhan factories and enterprises, following Chairman Mao's instructions on "mobilizing all positive factors, uniting all possible people, and turning as many negative factors as possible into positive factors," have organized tens of millions of people into the ranks of revolution and production. They have enthusiastically and correctly treated the deceived masses, done a lot of ideological and political work, and made the deceived masses return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line one after another, performing meritoriously in the battle to restore and develop production. At the same time, they have seriously implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy and correctly treated cadres. Recently, various factories have organized Chairman Mao's works study classes, enthusiastically helping cadres who have made mistakes to stand up and seize the revolution and promote production with the revolutionary masses, making new contributions to the revolution and production.

	Ershan Bayan Hotan Coal Mine's broad revolutionary workers are seizing the revolution and vigorously promoting production, completing the production plan for January to October ahead of schedule and overfulfilling it. This is a revolutionary miner and revolutionary cadre studying Chairman Mao's quotations before the shift.

    革命大批判日益深入，革命大联合日益发展
    武汉工业战线形势大好
    革命职工争当抓革命促生产模范，同时正确对待干部，正确对待受蒙蔽群众，把千百万群众组织到革命行列中来
    据新华社武汉电　武汉工业战线上的广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，坚决贯彻执行我们伟大领袖毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的方针，团结广大群众，相信和依靠干部的大多数，同他们一道艰苦奋战，保证了生产的迅速发展。从八月以来，许多工厂的生产一天高过一天，一旬高过一旬，一月高过一月。不少工厂日产水平，都超过了历史上的最高纪录。钢、铁、钢材、机床、冷冻机、印染布、搪瓷制品、纸张、电池等重要产品，生产大幅度增长。
    那里无产阶级文化大革命搞得好，那里必然出现生产的新高潮。记者最近访问了武汉许多工厂，处处看到革命和生产的一派热气腾腾的兴旺景象。广大革命职工班前班后大学毛主席著作，大唱毛主席语录歌，大谈大议无产阶级文化大革命的问题。他们上班搞生产，业余闹革命，工间搞协作。在车间内，工厂新选出来的革命委员会成员、各革命群众组织的负责人、广大的干部，同工人一道劳动，一道学习。随着革命大批判的深入开展，广大革命职工斗志更加昂扬。各厂矿企业技术革新、技术革命的胜利成果不断出现，打破新纪录、创造新成绩的捷报频传。
    在空前大好的革命形势下，武汉地区许多工厂企业的广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，以厂为单位实现了革命的大联合，这是取得革命和生产双胜利的重要因素。许多工厂已经建立或正在建立革命委员会。这些工厂企业的广大革命职工，人人坚守岗位，争当抓革命、促生产的模范，车间与车间，班组与班组，上下工序之间的协作大大加强。
    正确地对待干部，正确地对待广大受蒙蔽的群众，这是武汉工业部门当前夺取革命和生产双胜利的又一个重要因素。在“抓革命，促生产”的斗争中，武汉工厂企业的无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席关于“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素”的教导，把千百万群众组织到革命和生产的行列中来。他们满腔热情地正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，做了大量的思想政治工作，使受蒙蔽的群众纷纷回到了毛主席的革命路线上来，在恢复和发展生产的战斗中立了功。同时，认真贯彻执行了毛主席的干部政策，正确对待干部。最近以来，各工厂纷纷组织毛主席著作学习班，热情地帮助犯错误的干部站出来同革命群众一道抓革命，促生产，为革命和生产作出了新贡献。
