Anshan Iron and Steel Company Casting Pipe Factory’s proletarian revolutionary faction, with the help of a certain unit of the People’s Liberation Army stationed at the factory, has taken “fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism” as the key link, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao’s cadre policy, actively supported revolutionary cadres to come forward, and let them undergo tempering and testing on the front lines of revolution and production, creating new merits for the people. Currently, this factory has 73 cadres at the section chief level and above participating in the leadership of revolution and production, or have been assigned to various work positions. Together with the revolutionary masses, they grasp revolution and promote production, dare to take responsibility, and boldly shoulder heavy burdens, effectively promoting the revolution and production work of the entire factory.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Casting Pipe Factory particularly emphasizes the continuous use of Mao Zedong Thought to help and educate cadres. Many cadres who have already come forward in this factory were initially reluctant to take on leadership work and dare not take responsibility. Some leading cadres who had made more mistakes in the past and were more severely impacted by the revolutionary masses showed fear, afraid to take responsibility and afraid to make more mistakes. There were also a few who had not resolved some ideological knots, feeling uncomfortable. The proletarian revolutionary faction timely analyzed the causes of these active thoughts. They believed that the root cause of these phenomena in cadres was the “self” in their minds. To resolve these active thoughts, one must arm the cadres with the great Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the People’s Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team stationed at the factory, they held several cadre training classes, taking “fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism” as the key link, organizing cadres to study Chairman Mao’s latest instructions, as well as the brilliant works “Old Three Articles” and “Against Liberalism.” In the study, following the formula of “unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity,” they inspired cadres to consciously carry out self-revolution, fiercely fight against “self,” vigorously criticize revisionism, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Ninety-five percent of the cadres in the entire factory participated in the training in batches. Many cadres raised their class consciousness, correctly recognized their mistakes, and corrected their attitudes towards the masses. They said, the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao burned away our mistakes, which is our greatest happiness! They all expressed that they must break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, learn from the masses, go to the great winds and waves of revolution for tempering, and create new merits for the people.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Casting Pipe Factory also, according to the different active thoughts of cadres, tailored their approach and prescribed remedies, patiently carrying out a series of ideological and political work. They had individual talks with revolutionary cadres, visited their families, studied Chairman Mao’s works with them, removed their ideological concerns, inspired their fighting will, raised their revolutionary sense of responsibility, and established the thought of “completely” and “thoroughly” serving the people. For some revolutionary cadres who had not yet thought things through on certain issues, the proletarian revolutionary faction, in addition to enthusiastically helping them, also patiently waited, giving them time to think for a period, and letting them continue to resolve their ideological problems in the practice of struggle.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory also paid great attention to supporting the revolutionary cadres who came forward, creating conditions for revolutionary cadres to play a core and backbone role in the revolution and production struggle. Their main work included:

First, helping revolutionary cadres establish authority. Some cadres sometimes could not speak or command in specific work, and even encountered resistance. The proletarian revolutionary faction then educated the workers to obey the leadership, follow orders, respect revolutionary cadres, and firmly support and implement opinions that conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary faction members also took the lead in executing the correct opinions of revolutionary cadres. When revolutionary cadres created new merits in revolution and production, they were promptly commended. When their work had errors, the proletarian revolutionary faction took the initiative to assume responsibility and enthusiastically helped them correct them. The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory also paid attention to eliminating the phenomenon of “taking everything into their own hands,” and let revolutionary cadres do what they should do.

Second, helping revolutionary cadres improve their relationship with the masses and the relationship between superiors and subordinates. Some cadres had executed the bourgeois reactionary line and done wrong things to suppress the masses; some cadres had been high and mighty in the past, acting like officials and lords, alienating themselves from the masses. Therefore, some masses still had reservations about these revolutionary cadres who came forward. The proletarian revolutionary faction helped revolutionary cadres change their past official and lordly style, establish a democratic style, guide them to go deep into production, deep into workers’ dormitories, talk with workers, listen to the masses’ opinions, learn from the masses, check their own mistakes, be frank with the masses, accept the masses’ help, and gradually gained the understanding of the masses, strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

Third, helping revolutionary cadres solve various difficulties encountered in their work. The revolutionary mass organizations of this factory often sought the opinions of revolutionary cadres, actively understood the difficulties they encountered in their work, and helped them study and solve them. For a period, the casting workshop could not complete the plan for steel ingot molds, and the revolutionary leading cadres who came forward in this workshop were so worried that they could not eat or sleep well. The workshop revolutionary mass organization discovered this and actively helped convene a cadre meeting, taking corresponding measures, and quickly turned the situation around. Afterwards, this leading cadre excitedly said, “The revolutionary faction supports us like this, and we have no reason not to do a good job in revolutionary work!”

Fourth, helping revolutionary cadres continuously overcome shortcomings and mistakes. Many revolutionary cadres encountered various mistakes and shortcomings in their new conditions of work. The proletarian revolutionary faction, starting from caring for cadres, pointed out their shortcomings and mistakes in a timely manner through rectification meetings and discussions, helped them summarize experiences and lessons, corrected them in time, and continuously improved.

Because the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Casting Pipe Factory actively supported the revolutionary cadres who came forward, they dared to say what should be said, do what should be done, and manage what should be managed, truly playing the core and backbone role of revolutionary cadres. Cadres and masses worked together, promoting the continuous development of revolution and production in the entire factory. Now, the revolutionary cadres in this factory have fewer concerns, more enthusiasm, and more new merits. The cadres who have already come forward are living and fighting together with the workers. Many cadres live in the workshops, sleep in the factories, and together with the workers expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Anshan and Anshan Steel, together with the workers grasp revolution, promote production, plan for production, and solve production bottlenecks.

Recently, all workshops, sections, and departments of this factory have achieved revolutionary great unity by system and department, carried out revolutionary great criticism well, and production is booming. The production of continuous casting pipes has created a new high in the history of this factory.

    鞍钢铸管厂革命派让大批干部走上革命和生产第一线
    积极为站出来的革命干部撑腰
    干部大胆负责，勇挑重担，有力地推动了全厂的革命和生产工作
    据新华社鞍山七日电　鞍山钢铁公司铸管厂的无产阶级革命派，在驻厂解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，认真执行毛主席的干部政策，积极支持革命干部站出来，让他们在革命、生产第一线经受锻炼和考验，为人民立新功。现在，这个厂已经有七十三名科长级以上的革命干部，参加了革命、生产的领导工作，或者被分配到各种工作岗位。他们同革命群众一起抓革命、促生产，大胆负责，勇挑重担，有力地推动了全厂的革命和生产工作。
    铸管厂的无产阶级革命派，特别重视不断地用毛泽东思想帮助和教育干部。这个厂不少已经站出来的革命干部，在走上工作岗位初期，不敢承担领导工作，不敢大胆负责。一些过去犯错误较多，受到革命群众冲击较大的领导干部，表现“怕”字当头，怕担责任，怕再犯错误。还有极少数人，有一些思想疙瘩没有解开，心情不舒畅。无产阶级革命派及时地分析了产生这些活思想的原因。他们认为，干部的这些表现，最根本的是头脑中“私”字作怪。解决这些活思想，必须用伟大的毛泽东思想来武装干部。他们在驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，连续举办了几期干部学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，组织干部大学毛主席的最新指示，以及“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》等光辉著作。在学习中，按照“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式，启发干部自觉地进行自我革命，狠斗“私”字，猛批修正主义，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。全厂百分之九十五的干部，分期分批参加了轮训。许多干部提高了无产阶级觉悟，正确地认识了自己的错误，端正了对待群众的态度。他们说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动的烈火，烧掉了我们身上的错误，这是我们最大的幸福！他们纷纷表示，一定要破私立公，向群众学习，到革命的大风大浪中去锻炼，为人民立新功。
    铸管厂的无产阶级革命派还针对干部不同的活思想，因人制宜，对症下药，耐心地进行了一系列思想政治工作。他们和革命干部个别谈心，作家庭访问，同他们一起学习毛主席著作，解除干部的思想顾虑，鼓舞他们的斗争意志，提高他们的革命责任感，树立“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的思想。对待一些在有的问题上一时还想不通的革命干部，无产阶级革命派除了热心帮助外，还耐心等待，给他们时间，让他们多想一个时期，让他们继续在斗争实践中去解决自己的思想问题。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派还十分注意为站出来的革命干部撑腰杆子，为革命干部在革命和生产斗争中发挥核心作用和骨干作用创造条件。他们所做的工作主要有：
    一，帮助革命干部树立威信。一些干部在具体工作中有时说不动，叫不响，甚至遭到顶撞。无产阶级革命派就教育职工服从领导，听从指挥，尊重革命干部，凡是符合毛泽东思想的意见，就应该执行，给予坚决支持。革命派战士还带头执行革命干部的正确意见。革命干部在革命和生产中立了新功，就及时提出表扬。他们的工作出了差错，无产阶级革命派主动承担责任，热情帮助他们纠正。这个厂的无产阶级革命派还注意克服那种“包揽一切”的现象，应该革命干部做的事，他们就放手让革命干部去做。
    二，帮助革命干部改善与群众的关系，改善上下级的关系。有些干部执行过资产阶级反动路线，做过压制群众的错事；有些干部过去高高在上，做官当老爷，脱离群众。因此，有的群众对站出来的这些革命干部一时还存有戒心。无产阶级革命派就帮助革命干部改变过去那种做官当老爷的作风，树立民主作风，引导他们深入生产，深入工人宿舍，同工人谈心，倾听群众意见，向群众学习，检查自己的错误，与群众开诚相见，接受群众帮助，从而渐渐地得到了群众的谅解，密切了干部和群众的关系。
    三，帮助革命干部解决工作中遇到的各种难题。这个厂的革命群众组织，经常征求革命干部的意见，主动了解他们工作中遇到的难题，帮助研究解决。有个时期，铸造车间钢锭模完不成计划，这个车间站出来的革命领导干部为此吃不好睡不着。车间革命群众组织发现后主动帮助召开干部会，采取了相应措施，很快扭转了局面。事后，这个领导干部激动地说：“革命派这样为咱撑腰杆，我们没有任何理由干不好革命工作！”
    四，帮助革命干部不断克服缺点、错误。许多革命干部在新的条件下工作，不可避免地会出现这样或那样的错误和缺点。无产阶级革命派发现他们的缺点、错误，从爱护干部出发，通过整风会、座谈会及时指出，帮助他们总结经验教训，及时改正，不断提高。
    由于铸管厂的无产阶级革命派积极为站出来的革命干部撑腰杆子，促使他们该说的敢说，该做的敢做，该管的敢管，真正发挥了革命干部的核心作用和骨干作用。干部和群众齐心协力，推动了全厂的革命和生产不断发展。现在，这个厂的革命干部顾虑少，干劲足，立新功的多。已经站出来的干部，纷纷同工人生活在一起，战斗在一起。不少干部住在车间，睡在工厂，同工人一起揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在鞍山、鞍钢的代理人的滔天罪行，同工人一起抓革命，促生产，为生产出谋划策，解决生产关键。
    最近，这个厂所有车间、工段、科室全部按系统、按部门实现了革命大联合，革命大批判搞得好，生产蒸蒸日上，连续铸管的产量创造了本厂历史上的最高水平。
