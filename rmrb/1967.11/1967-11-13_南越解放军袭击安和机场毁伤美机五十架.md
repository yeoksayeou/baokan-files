The South Vietnamese Liberation Army has achieved a major victory in the dry season by attacking the An Hoa Airbase, destroying and damaging 50 U.S. aircraft. In the Kunshan Province, the local armed forces have been continuously striking U.S. troops in the Da Do region, killing over 500 enemy soldiers.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, November 12th: According to the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, on the night of October 30th, the people's liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province in South Vietnam launched a lightning attack on the An Hoa Airbase south of Da Nang. They destroyed and damaged 50 U.S. aggressor aircraft in just five minutes. During this fierce attack, they also killed and wounded 316 U.S. invaders.

The An Hoa Airbase is part of the U.S. military's Chu Lai base.

This is the eighth time the people's liberation armed forces have attacked this important U.S. Marine Corps base. In these eight attacks, they have destroyed and damaged 287 U.S. military aircraft and killed and wounded 2,209 U.S. invaders, most of whom were technical personnel and pilots.

The South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency stated that the people's liberation armed forces of Quang Nam Province launched this attack in response to the call of the National Liberation Front to achieve victory in the dry season and to severely punish the U.S. aggressors who recently carried out mad bombing raids on Hanoi and other parts of North Vietnam.

Xinhua News Agency, November 12th: Saigon news: The people's liberation armed forces of Kunshan Province in South Vietnam continue to fiercely attack U.S. invaders in the newly opened battlefield of Da Do. According to Western news agencies, the people's liberation armed forces have killed and wounded over 300 U.S. troops in the past two days, bringing the total number of U.S. casualties in Da Do to over 500 in the past week.

Reports indicate that the people's liberation armed forces have fully utilized the advantageous terrain of the dense forests and mountains in the Da Do region to severely strike the enemy. They have already tied down approximately 6,000 invading troops from the U.S. 4th Infantry Division and the 173rd Airborne Brigade, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

The people's liberation armed forces, who have won several consecutive victories in the Da Do region, fought a brilliant battle on the 11th. They attacked two companies of U.S. troops that were out on maneuvers in the southwest of Da Do and ambushed another two companies of U.S. troops that attempted to come to the rescue. They also used mortars to shell a group of about 500 U.S. troops that were out clearing the battlefield and ambushed a U.S. military convoy traveling on the Kunshan to Da Do road. In these battles, the people's liberation armed forces fought the enemy to a standstill, killing and wounding 270 U.S. aggressors. In the early hours of the 12th, when U.S. helicopters arrived at the battlefield to collect the dead and evacuate the wounded, the U.S. base was again shelled by the people's liberation armed forces, resulting in dozens of casualties.

To break out of the passive situation in the Da Do region, the U.S. aggressors are continuing to send reinforcements and brazenly deploying B-52 bombers to bomb this region indiscriminately. However, all these efforts have done nothing to alleviate the predicament of the U.S. invaders.

    夺取旱季大捷　严惩美国侵略者
    南越解放军袭击安和机场毁伤美机五十架
    昆嵩省人民武装在达多地区连续猛袭美军歼敌五百多
    新华社河内十二日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，十月三十日晚上，越南南方广南省人民解放武装力量对岘港以南的安和机场进行闪电式袭击，击毁击伤美国强盗飞机五十架。在这次只持续五分钟的猛烈袭击中，还打死打伤美国侵略军三百一十六人。
    安和机场是侵越美军朱莱基地的组成部分。
    这是人民解放武装力量第八次袭击这个美国海军陆战队的重要基地。在八次袭击中，共击毁击伤美军飞机二百八十七架，打死打伤美国侵略军二千二百零九名，其中大部分是技术人员和飞行员。
    越南南方解放通讯社说，广南省人民解放武装力量发动这次袭击，是为了响应民族解放阵线的号召，夺取旱季胜利和严惩最近疯狂轰炸河内和越南北方其他地方的美国侵略者。
    新华社十二日讯　西贡消息：越南南方昆嵩省人民解放武装力量在新开辟的达多地区的战场上，继续猛烈袭击美国侵略军。据西方通讯社透露，人民解放武装力量在最近两天中又打死打伤美军三百多人，从而使美国强盗过去一周在达多地区的死伤总数达到了五百多人。
    据报道，人民解放武装力量充分利用达多地区丛林密布的山地的有利地形，狠狠打击敌人。他们已经在这里牵制了属于美国第四步兵师和第一七三空降旅的约六千名侵略军，不断给敌人以大量消耗和杀伤。
    在达多地区连打几天胜仗的人民解放武装力量，十一日又打了一场漂亮仗。他们在达多西南袭击了外出活动的两连美军，并且截击了企图前来救援的另两连美军。他们还用迫击炮轰击了外出打扫战场的一股约五百名的美军，伏击了正在从昆嵩到达多公路上行驶的一支美军车队。在上述战斗中，人民解放武装力量把敌人打得焦头烂额，共打死打伤美国强盗二百七十人。十二日凌晨，当美国直升飞机到战场上收尸和抢运伤员的时候，美军阵地又遭了人民解放武装力量的炮轰，死伤数十人。
    为了摆脱在达多地区被动挨打的局面，美国侵略强盗正在继续向这里增兵，并悍然出动B—52型轰炸机对这个地区进行狂轰滥炸。但是，这一切丝毫不能摆脱美国侵略者的困境。
