The pound's devaluation has thrown the London financial market into chaos. A sense of distrust towards the pound and the dollar, which is closely tied to the pound, has spread over London, Paris, and Zurich, the financial centers of Western Europe.

In recent days, after the wave of selling pounds in the foreign exchange markets of London and the capitalist world due to the pound's devaluation, a frenzy of buying gold and silver has emerged. This is because people have lost confidence in both the dollar and the pound.

News from Western Europe indicates that private speculators have been frantically selling paper currency to buy gold, silver, and gold coins. Even gold medals are being snatched up. In London, the world's largest gold market, there has been a continuous five-day surge in gold buying. The "buying frenzy" in the Paris gold and silver market has broken post-war records. Five major banks in Switzerland have been forced to temporarily suspend gold futures trading. In Milan, Italy, gold is in short supply and high demand. The gold-buying frenzy reached Johannesburg, South Africa, on the 24th, causing the Johannesburg Stock Exchange to fall into chaos. Western financial figures admit that all of this reflects a loss of confidence in the dollar and the pound. British Conservative Party leader Heath lamented in a parliamentary debate on the 22nd that as the "vanguard" of the dollar, the pound has devalued, leading to a "total attack" on the dollar.

According to estimates by Western financial figures, in the week since the pound's devaluation, the gold-buying frenzy has caused the United States to lose approximately $600 million in gold, equivalent to ten times the amount of gold lost by the United States in August of this year.

Despite the U.S. government's efforts to stabilize the dollar by selling gold, the price of gold in the gold and silver markets of the capitalist world continues to rise, while the dollar's exchange rate continues to fall.

Facing this extremely dire situation, U.S. President Johnson hurriedly reaffirmed on the 24th through his press secretary that the United States is determined to continue buying and selling gold at the official price of $35 per ounce; the United States has no intention of changing the current gold-dollar exchange rate. This is the second time Johnson has come out to "guarantee" the dollar in a week, attempting to stabilize public sentiment. U.S. news agencies revealed that Johnson is currently personally maintaining close contact with the "activities of the world monetary market," regularly "receiving reports" to "cope with the threat of economic chaos." This reflects the anxious yet forced calmness of the U.S. ruling class regarding the future of the dollar.

According to a report from the New China News Agency in London, due to the pound's devaluation, news of impending price increases in Britain has been coming in one after another. Britain imports 50% of its food and 80-90% of its raw materials annually, so the price increase of imported goods after the pound's devaluation will further stimulate price increases. Newspapers and television here have repeatedly predicted that prices will rise across the board, with bread prices set to increase after Christmas, and meat prices expected to rise in a week or two. The British National Food Trade Association admitted on the 21st that due to the pound's devaluation, all food prices may rise. Newspapers here have had to admit that low-income laborers will be the hardest hit.

### 英镑贬值　美元不稳  资本主义世界抢购黄金白银成风

    英镑贬值　美元不稳
    资本主义世界抢购黄金白银成风
    据新华社讯　英镑贬值后，伦敦金融市场一片混乱。对英镑以及对同英镑有千丝万缕联系的美元的不信任气氛，笼罩着伦敦、巴黎和苏黎世等西欧金融中心。
    几天来，在伦敦以及资本主义世界的外汇市场上由于英镑贬值而掀起的抛售英镑的风潮刚过去，又出现了抢购黄金和白银的狂热，这是因为人们对美元和英镑都丧失信心。
    来自西欧的消息表明，私人投机商连日来拚命地抛出纸币，抢购黄金白银和金币；甚至金质奖章也在抢购之列。在伦敦这个资本主义世界最大的黄金市场上，连续五天出现了抢购黄金的浪潮。巴黎金银市场的“买风”打破了战后的纪录。瑞士五家最大银行被迫暂停黄金的期货交易。意大利的米兰，也是黄金缺货，供不应求。抢购黄金的风潮在二十四日还刮到了出产黄金的南非，使约翰内斯堡证券交易所陷于一片混乱。西方金融界人士承认，这一切反映了人们对美元和英镑的不信任。英国保守党头头希思二十二日在议会辩论中哀叹，作为美元“前卫”的英镑既已贬值，这就导致了“对美元的总攻击”。
    据西方金融界人士估计，英镑贬值以来的一周中，各地抢购黄金的风潮已经使美国损失了大约六亿美元的黄金，相当于美国在今年八月份黄金流失量的十倍。
    尽管美国政府采取了抛售黄金等做法来稳定美元，但是，随着资本主义世界金银市场上的黄金价格不断上涨，美元牌价不断下跌。
    面对着这种极端险恶的局势，美国总统约翰逊急忙在二十四日通过他的新闻秘书再次重申，美国决心继续按每盎司三十五美元的官定价格收售黄金；美国无意改变黄金同美元的现行比价。这是约翰逊在一周之内第二次出来给美元“打保票”，以图稳定人心。美国通讯社透露，约翰逊目前亲自同“世界货币市场的活动保持密切接触”，定期“收听报告”，以“应付”“出现经济混乱局面的威胁”。这反映了美国统治集团对美元前景胆战心惊而又不得不故作镇静的窘态。
    据新华社伦敦电　由于英镑贬值，英国国内物价即将上涨的消息，接踵传来。英国每年要进口食品的百分之五十和原料的百分之八、九十，因此，英镑贬值后进口商品价格的提高必然进一步刺激物价上涨。这里的报纸和电视已经一再预报物价将普遍上涨，其中面包在圣诞节后即将涨价，肉价过一两个星期也要提高。英国全国食品商联合会二十一日承认，由于英镑贬值，所有的食品价格都可能上涨。这里的报纸不得不承认，收入菲薄的劳动人民将遭到最严重的打击。
