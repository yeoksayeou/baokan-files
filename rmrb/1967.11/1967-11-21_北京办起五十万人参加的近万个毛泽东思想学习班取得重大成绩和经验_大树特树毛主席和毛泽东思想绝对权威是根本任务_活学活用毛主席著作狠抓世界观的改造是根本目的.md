Beijing has established nearly 10,000 Mao Zedong Thought study classes with 500,000 participants, achieving major successes and experiences. The fundamental task is to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. The fundamental purpose is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works and to focus on transforming one's worldview.

The masses' consciousness has been greatly raised, promoting revolutionary unity, the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the struggle-criticism-transformation within units, the resumption of classes and the promotion of revolution, and the promotion of revolution and production.

The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held an experience-sharing meeting, requiring that the establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes be placed at the forefront of all work, and that Beijing be turned into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

A report from Xinhua News Agency on the 20th: The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a Mao Zedong Thought study class experience-sharing meeting on the 16th. Attendees discussed the unprecedented and excellent situation of the vigorous development and major achievements of Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various industries across the city, and resolved to further promote and elevate these classes, making them better and more numerous.

Over 1,300 people, including leaders of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, representatives from various industries, enterprises, schools, and rural areas in the city, and People's Liberation Army soldiers participating in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, attended the meeting. Representatives from the Beijing Hotel Management Office, Beijing Tram Company, Beijing Daxing County, Beijing No. 35 Middle School, and military support personnel shared their experiences in establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the theme of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism."

After Vice Chairman Lin Biao issued the call to "respond to Chairman Mao's great call, use 'fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism' as the guideline, strengthen ideological education for military cadres, local cadres, and Red Guards. Various study classes should be established, by the central government, by local governments, and by revolutionary mass organizations, turning the entire country into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought" during the National Day speech, the broad masses of workers, peasants, People's Liberation Army soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals in Beijing, with their strong class feelings of boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty towards the great leader Chairman Mao, swiftly and resolutely, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. From factories to rural areas, from schools to offices, in a short period, the city established over 9,800 Mao Zedong Thought study classes of various forms, with nearly 500,000 participants. The broad revolutionary masses and cadres eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works, linking them to their thoughts and reality, fiercely fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. The city's movement to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works has entered a new stage, with Mao Zedong Thought becoming more widespread and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line deeply ingrained in people's hearts. Various units in the city that held Mao Zedong Thought study classes prioritized learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles," studying and applying them repeatedly. Chairman Mao's books are never out of hand, his words are never out of mouth, his thoughts are engraved in the mind, and put into action. Whatever Chairman Mao says is done, whether understood or not. People voluntarily use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their thoughts and actions, transforming both the objective and subjective worlds, focusing on the "application."

Mao Zedong Thought study classes emphasize situation education, extensively discussing the great victories of the Cultural Revolution, the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The masses, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, analyze and understand the unprecedented excellent situation, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, more correctly understanding and more consciously implementing Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Cultural Revolution. The political consciousness of the broad revolutionary masses has been raised, their revolutionary enthusiasm has increased, and their fighting spirit has become more ardent.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes have promoted the ideological transformation of the people, pushing the Cultural Revolution deeper, promoting revolutionary unity, the revolutionary three-in-one combination, the struggle-criticism-transformation within units, the resumption of classes and the promotion of revolution, and the promotion of revolution and production. After establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the broad revolutionary masses resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on revolutionary unity, fiercely fighting selfishness and sweeping away petty-bourgeois factionalism, actively consolidating and developing revolutionary unity in thought. Based on the struggle against selfishness and criticism of revisionism and revolutionary unity, a large number of revolutionary cadres have stood out, and many units have elected the original leading cadres to take important positions in the leading bodies. Out of the 18 counties and districts in the city, 14 have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary preparatory groups. Units that have done well or relatively well in revolutionary unity and the revolutionary three-in-one combination have begun the struggle-criticism-transformation within their units, carrying out more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. After the resumption of classes and the promotion of revolution in primary and secondary schools across the city, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have vowed to be revolutionary cadres who will carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, thoroughly smashing the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, launching a new high tide of proletarian educational revolution, and turning schools into vibrant Mao Zedong Thought schools.

The many experiences and insights shared at the meeting on establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes have greatly helped and inspired the attendees. They reflected that this experience-sharing meeting was well-organized. Their common experience in running Mao Zedong Thought study classes well is: first, to focus on attitude. The fundamental task of Mao Zedong Thought study classes is to firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, the classes should emphasize that Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, that Mao Zedong Thought is the banner of our era, and that the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution, Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. Through class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, cultivate the students' deep class feelings towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. Second, to focus on active learning and application, emphasizing the "application." Actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works is the key to running the classes well. One must dare to put oneself in the picture, bravely expose one's thoughts, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, focus on transforming one's worldview, and uproot revisionism. One must focus on active thoughts, seize every opportunity to fight, and persist until the end.

To consolidate achievements and develop victories, leading the advanced to bring along the general, and raising the level of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the meeting requires that all levels of leadership in the city must prioritize the work of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with the main leaders of various levels or the main responsible persons of mass organizations taking the lead. They must also lead by example, personally study and apply Chairman Mao's works well, and lead in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They must plan and step-by-step train all revolutionary cadres and masses in their departments and units, creating a thick atmosphere of studying Chairman Mao's works across the city, and raising the level of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad revolutionary masses. To meet the urgent needs of the broad masses to participate in learning and to ensure that both revolution and production are not neglected, it is advocated to establish part-time Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Full-time professional study classes and part-time study classes should be combined, with professionals as the backbone, driving part-time study classes. Mao Zedong Thought study classes should be run better and better, turning Beijing into a grand school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Participants in the Mao Zedong Thought study class of the Beijing Hotel System, employees of the New Overseas Chinese Hotel, are writing pledges, determined to use "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, focusing on revolution and promoting production.

    新华社二十日讯　北京市革命委员会十六日召开了毛泽东思想学习班经验交流会。到会同志畅谈全市各行各业毛泽东思想学习班蓬勃发展并取得重大成绩的空前大好形势，决心进一步推动，进一步提高，把毛泽东思想学习班办得更多更好。
    北京市革命委员会负责同志，来自全市工矿企业、学校、农村的代表和参加“三支”“两军”工作的人民解放军指战员，共一千三百多人参加了会议。北京市饭店工作办公室、北京市电车公司、北京市大兴县、北京三十五中的代表和解放军支左人员，介绍了他们以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班的经验。
    林彪副主席在国庆节讲话中发出“响应毛主席的伟大号召，用‘斗私，批修’这四个字为纲，加强对军队干部、地方干部和红卫兵的思想教育。要开办各种学习班，中央办，地方办，各个革命群众组织也可以办，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校”的战斗号召以后，北京市的广大工农群众、人民解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命领导干部和革命知识分子，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚的强烈阶级感情，雷厉风行，在人民解放军的帮助下，大办毛泽东思想学习班。从工厂到农村，从学校到机关，在短短的时间里，全市办起了各种形式的毛泽东思想学习班九千八百多个，参加学习的近五十万人。广大革命群众和革命干部，如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作，联系思想，联系实际，狠斗私字，狠批修正主义。全市活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动进入了一个新阶段，毛泽东思想更加普及，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线更加深入人心。全市各单位举办的毛泽东思想学习班，把学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”放在第一位，反复学，反复用。毛主席的书不离手，毛主席的话不离口，毛主席的思想铭记在脑子里，落实在行动上，毛主席怎么说就怎么做，理解的照办，暂时不理解的也照办。人们自觉地用毛泽东思想指导自己的思想和行动，既改造客观世界，也改造主观世界，在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    毛泽东思想学习班狠抓形势教育，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。广大群众以毛泽东思想为指针，分析和认识空前大好形势，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，更正确地理解和更自觉地贯彻执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策。广大革命群众的政治觉悟更高了，革命干劲更大了，斗志更加昂扬了。
    毛泽东思想学习班促进了人的思想革命化，推动了无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，推动了革命的大联合、革命的三结合、本单位的斗批改，以及复课闹革命和抓革命、促生产。在开办毛泽东思想学习班以后，广大革命群众坚决执行毛主席关于革命大联合的指示，狠斗私字，横扫小资产阶级派性，积极从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合。在斗私批修和革命大联合的基础上，大批的革命干部站了出来，不少单位还推举原来革命领导干部中的第一把手担任领导班子的重要工作。全市十八个县区，已有十四个县区成立了革命委员会或革筹小组。革命大联合、革命三结合搞得好的和比较好的单位，已经开始转入本单位的斗批改。更广泛、深入地开展革命大批判。全市大中小学复课闹革命以后，广大革命师生誓做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，掀起无产阶级教育革命的新高潮，把学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    会上介绍的大办毛泽东思想学习班的许多经验体会，给到会同志很大帮助和启发。大家反映，这个经验交流会开得好。他们办好毛泽东思想学习班的共同经验是：第一，要抓态度。毛泽东思想学习班的根本任务就是大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。因此，学习班就是要大讲毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，大讲毛泽东思想是我们时代的旗帜，大讲对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度问题是区别革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、马克思列宁主义和修正主义的分水岭。通过忆苦思甜的阶级教育，培养学员对毛主席和毛泽东思想的深厚阶级感情。第二，狠抓活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。活学活用毛主席著作是搞好学习班的根本。要敢于把自己摆进去，勇于把思想亮出来，斗私，批修，狠抓世界观的改造，狠挖修正主义的根子。要大抓狠抓活思想。事事抓，处处抓，时时抓，始终抓，一抓到底。
    为了巩固成绩，发展胜利，以先进带动一般，把毛泽东思想学习班的水平提高一步，会议要求全市各级领导必须把大办毛泽东思想学习班的工作放在一切工作的首位，由各级主要领导干部或群众组织的主要负责人来抓，并且要以身作则，带头学好、用好，带头斗私批修。要有计划有步骤地把本部门本单位的革命干部、革命群众普遍轮训一遍，把全市学习毛主席著作的空气搞得浓浓的，把广大革命群众的毛泽东思想的水平提得高高的。为了适应广大群众参加学习的迫切要求，保证革命生产两不误，大力提倡办毛泽东思想业余学习班。要实行脱产专业学习班和业余学习班相结合，以专业为骨干，带动业余学习班。要把毛泽东思想学习班办得好上加好，把北京市办成毛泽东思想的大学校。（附图片）
