The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing's Guang'anmen Station has been established! Revolutionary masses gathered in front of the Revolutionary Committee, joyfully cheering for the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The heart of the Committee's Chairman (original Party Secretary) Wang Shuntong was especially moved. He tightly grasped the hand of the old worker Sun Qinglin and said, "It is you who helped me catch up with the team. I will forever fight alongside you, closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, and carry the revolution through to the end!"

A Comprehensive View of Cadres

In the early stages of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Wang Shuntong implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, suppressing and striking down the revolutionary enthusiasm of the revolutionary masses. In January of this year, the proletarian revolutionary factions of this station united to seize power and established the "Coordination Headquarters." At that time, due to the hatred towards the bourgeois reactionary line and the influence of the "doubt everything, overthrow everything" reactionary tide, everyone held a suspicious attitude towards cadres, unwilling to approach them, let alone trust them. Wang Shuntong and some other cadres were thus sidelined.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of Guang'anmen Station studied Chairman Mao's teachings on cadre issues. They realized that revolutionary cadres are a precious asset of our Party and state. They must be analyzed class-wise; they cannot be indiscriminately rejected without distinguishing right from wrong. If so, it would fall right into the trap of the class enemy, causing both the revolution and production to suffer losses. They conducted a class analysis of Wang Shuntong, believing that Wang Shuntong was generally good in major principles. He had a deep class sentiment towards the Party and Chairman Mao and followed the Party and Chairman Mao; he dared to take responsibility in his work, had strong organizational abilities, and achieved certain accomplishments. The revolutionary factions should help him stand up. They had heart-to-heart talks with Wang Shuntong, helping him recognize his mistakes and encouraging him to stand tall and revolutionary. Although Wang Shuntong still had some resistance to the masses' criticism, he thought, "Only by being with the masses can I avoid offending them," and thus stood up.

Waiting Can Be an Option

In April, the revolutionary masses of Guang'anmen Station, due to differing views on some specific issues, split into two factions: the "Headquarters" and the "Coordination Station." At this time, Wang Shuntong thought: Which side should I stand on? If I stand with the "Headquarters," the "Coordination Station" will say I am the "backer" of the "Headquarters" and might criticize me; if I stand with the "Coordination Station," I will get the same result. Thus, due to selfishness, he had just stood up but quickly retreated again.

The revolutionary masses continued to mobilize Wang Shuntong to stand up and revolutionize together with them. However, Wang Shuntong thought: "Now the winds are strong and the rains are heavy; standing up to take risks, and waiting until the rain stops and the sky clears to stand up is not too late. I have been in the revolution since 1944 and have never made any major mistakes. Anyway, I cannot be labeled as a capitalist-roader." Some masses, seeing this situation, were very angry and said, "Without him, we can still carry out the revolution!"

Chairman Mao taught us: "The work of ideological remolding is a long-term, patient, and painstaking task. One cannot expect to change people's ideological consciousness, formed over several decades of life, by giving a few lectures or holding a few meetings." Many comrades studied this teaching of Chairman Mao and understood that they must do patient and painstaking ideological work on Wang Shuntong. If Wang Shuntong does not understand the masses' criticism for the time being, he should be given more time to think. The revolutionary factions neither indulged nor ignored his mistakes, nor did they give up on him or strike him down with one blow. To help him recognize and correct his mistakes, the responsible persons of the revolutionary mass organizations and the old workers of the station often had heart-to-heart talks with him, enlightening and encouraging him. Old worker Sun Qinglin had talked to him more than ten times, sincerely saying, "Old Wang! You can't just lie down and do nothing! Especially in the midst of class struggle, it is a test of our time. You must correct your attitude, face your mistakes, humbly accept the help of comrades, and stand tall to continue the revolution." These heartfelt words struck Wang Shuntong's heart. But he thought, will the masses easily forgive my mistakes? Are they truly liberating me? Thinking it over, he still felt it was better to stand aside. This way, a part of the masses had even greater opinions about Wang Shuntong.

Just at this time, the comrades from the PLA arrived. After understanding Wang Shuntong's entire history and his performance in the Cultural Revolution, they organized the masses to review Chairman Mao's cadre policy, making everyone further realize that: For cadres who have made mistakes, one should not adopt a passive attitude, let alone discriminate against them, but should, with full proletarian feelings, "observe and help," tirelessly do in-depth and detailed political and ideological work.

Finally, He Stood Up

After the recognition was unified, whether it was the core members of both factions or the revolutionary masses, they all extended warm hands to Wang Shuntong. They organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes, letting Wang Shuntong and other cadres seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions and other related works. Wang Shuntong studied Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" over and over again, thinking: The revolutionary masses, to ensure the country does not change color, rose up in rebellion, which is "very good." But once the masses rose up and touched upon his own interests, he wanted to drop the burden and did not want to revolutionize. His thoughts compared to the revolutionary masses were truly miles apart! He always thought that his background was good, he had not made any major mistakes, and he could rely on his past merits, not understanding the masses' criticism, which actually meant he only allowed himself to overthrow others but did not allow others to overthrow him.

Mao Zedong Thought was like a gentle breeze, blowing Wang Shuntong's mind clear. The more he studied, the brighter his heart became, the more he felt he had wronged the masses, the more he felt he had wronged the Party and Chairman Mao. Wang Shuntong excitedly said, "Chairman Mao cares so much about us revolutionary cadres. I absolutely cannot disappoint his expectations. I should examine my mistakes, correct my mistakes, bravely stand up to revolutionize, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The comrades from the PLA also arranged for Wang Shuntong to have the opportunity to "come out," letting him have heart-to-heart talks with the masses and make a deep self-examination to the masses. First, through cadres entering the workshop and working with the workers, let Wang Shuntong feel the revolutionary sentiments of the masses and make a self-examination to the masses, further establishing the mass viewpoint.

The second step was through cadres participating in the criticism of the bourgeois reactionary line and the criticism of capitalist-roaders within the Party at large meetings, arranging Wang Shuntong to speak, letting him, through actual struggles, raise his ideological awareness.

The third step was to hold small-scale heart-to-heart meetings and "coming out" meetings, letting Wang Shuntong have heart-to-heart talks with the masses, touching souls, and bravely "come out."

Through these activities, Wang Shuntong's awareness continuously improved. He sincerely examined: In the movement, I made mistakes, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, stood against the masses, suppressed, and hindered the revolutionary mass movement. This is a matter of principle. But when everyone criticized me, I was not convinced; when I was asked to stand up, I was afraid of taking risks and retreated. I thought, having been in the revolution for so many years, even if I had no merits, I had sufferings. How could I be labeled as a capitalist-roader? Ultimately, it was my "selfishness" that was at the forefront. I must thoroughly reform my worldview, forever stand with the masses, and follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life.

Under the warm help of the PLA and the proletarian revolutionary factions, Wang Shuntong finally returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and was subsequently elected as the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee.

    干部思想出现反复怎么办？
    ——广安门车站第一把手王顺同是怎样站出来的
    孔令桐　佘光增　夏网培
    北京市广安门车站革命委员会诞生了！革命群众簇拥在革命委员会的门前，纵情欢呼毛主席革命路线的伟大胜利。革命委员会主任（原党委书记）王顺同的心情，特别激动，他紧紧握着老工人孙清林的手说：“是你们帮助我跟上了队伍。我要永远和你们战斗在一起，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，把革命进行到底！”
    全面地看待干部
    在无产阶级文化大革命初期，王顺同执行了资产阶级反动路线，压制和打击了革命群众的革命热情。在今年一月份，这个车站的无产阶级革命派联合起来夺权，成立了“联络总部”。当时，由于对资产阶级反动路线的愤恨和受了“怀疑一切，打倒一切”反动思潮的影响，大家对干部抱怀疑态度，不愿接近他们，更不信任他们。王顺同和一些干部就靠边站了。
    广安门车站的无产阶级革命派，学习了毛主席关于干部问题的教导。他们认识到：革命干部是我们党和国家的宝贵财富，对他们必须作阶级分析，不能不分青红皂白，一概加以排斥。如果那样，就正中了阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，会使革命和生产都受到损失。他们对王顺同进行了阶级分析，认为王顺同在大节上还是好的，他对党和毛主席有比较深厚的阶级感情，是跟着党和毛主席走的；在工作中敢于大胆负责，有较强的组织能力，做出了一定成绩。革命派应该帮助他站出来。他们找王顺同谈心，帮助他认识错误，鼓励他挺起腰来革命。王顺同尽管对群众的批判还有些抵触情绪，但是认为“只有和群众在一起，才能不得罪群众”，就这样站出来了。
    还可以等待
    四月份，广安门车站的革命群众，因为对一些具体问题的看法不同，就分裂成“总部”和“联络站”两派组织。这时，王顺同想：我该站在那一边呢？如果站在“总部”一边，“联络站”会说我是“总部”的“后台”，说不定要挨批判；要是站在“联络站”一边，也会得到同样的结果。这样，由于“私”字作怪，他刚刚站出来，又赶快退回去了。
    革命群众继续动员王顺同站出来和大家一起闹革命。但是，王顺同却认为：“现在风大雨大，站出来担风险，将来雨过天晴再站也不晚。我从一九四四年参加革命，一直没犯过什么大错误，反正不能把我打成走资派。”有些群众看到这种情况，非常生气地说：“没有他，咱照样干革命！”
    毛主席教导我们：“思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作，不能企图上几次课，开几次会，就把人家在几十年生活中间形成的思想意识改变过来。”许多同志学习了毛主席的这个教导，懂得必须对王顺同做耐心的、细致的思想工作。王顺同对群众的批判一时想不通，应该让他多想一想。革命派既不能姑息迁就他的错误，也不能甩手不管，或者一棍子打死。为了帮助他认识和改正错误，革命群众组织的负责人和车站的老工人经常找他谈心，启发他，鼓励他。老工人孙清林曾经找他谈过十几次，诚恳地说：“老王啊！你可不能躺倒不干呀！越是在阶级斗争的风浪里，越是考验咱们的时候，你要端正态度，正视自己的错误，虚心接受同志们的帮助，挺起腰来继续革命。”这些语重心长的话，句句打在王顺同的心上。但他转念一想：群众对我的错误会不会轻易放过？是不是真心解放我？想来想去，还是觉得不如靠边站。这样一来，一部分群众对王顺同的意见就更大了。
    正在这时，解放军同志来了。他们了解了王顺同的全部历史和他在文化大革命运动中的表现后，便组织群众重温了毛主席的干部政策，使大家进一步认识到：对于犯错误的领导干部，不能消极观望，更不应歧视，而要以满腔的无产阶级感情去“一看二帮”，不厌其烦地做深入细致的政治思想工作。
    终于站出来了
    认识统一了以后，无论是两派的核心成员，还是革命群众，都向王顺同伸出热情的手。他们举办了毛泽东思想学习班，让王顺同和其他干部一起认真学习毛主席的最新指示和其他有关著作。王顺同一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，心里想：革命群众为了保证国家不变颜色，起来造反，就是“好得很”。可是群众一起来触及了自己的利益，就想撂挑子，不想革命了。自己的思想和革命群众相比，真是相差十万八千里！自己老以为出身好，没犯过大错误，就吃老本，对群众的批判想不通，这实际上就是只许自己革别人的命，不让别人革自己的命。
    毛泽东思想象阵阵春风，把王顺同的头脑吹得清醒了。他越学心里越亮堂，越学越觉得对不起群众，越学越觉得对不起党、对不起毛主席。王顺同激动地说：“毛主席对我们革命干部这样关心，我绝不能辜负他老人家的希望，应该检查错误，改正错误，勇敢地站出来革命，迅速地回到毛主席的革命路线上来。”
    解放军同志还给王顺同安排了“亮相”的机会，让他和群众以心交心，向群众作深刻检查。首先，通过干部深入班组和工人一起干活，让王顺同体会群众的革命感情，并向群众进行检查，进一步树立群众观点。
    第二步是通过干部参加批判资产阶级反动路线和批判党内走资派的大会，安排王顺同发言，让他通过实际斗争来提高思想认识。
    第三步是召开小型谈心会、亮相会，让王顺同和群众思想见面，促膝谈心，触及灵魂，大胆“亮相”。
    通过这些活动，王顺同的觉悟不断提高。他诚恳地检查说：我在运动中犯了错误，执行了资产阶级反动路线，站到了群众的对面，压制和阻碍了革命群众运动。这是大是大非问题。可是，大家批判我，我不服气；要我站出来，我又怕担风险，退了回去。心想，革命这么多年，没有功劳也有苦劳，怎么说也把我打不成走资派。归根结底，是自己“私”字当头。我一定要彻底改造自己的世界观，永远和群众站在一起，紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命。
    在解放军和无产阶级革命派热情帮助下，王顺同终于回到毛主席的革命路线上来了，随后又被选为革命委员会主任。
