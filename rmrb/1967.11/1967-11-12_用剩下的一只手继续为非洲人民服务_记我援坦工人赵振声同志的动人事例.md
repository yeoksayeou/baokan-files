In the suburbs of Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania, a modern factory—Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory—built with Chinese aid is under full-scale construction. Among the Chinese workers participating in this project, Zhao Zhensheng was injured on the job and lost his left arm. However, he continues to serve the African people with his remaining arm. This lofty internationalist spirit has been widely praised among the local people.

Last October, on a midday in the construction site of the Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory, a concrete mixer operated by a Tanzanian worker malfunctioned. Zhao Zhensheng, a Chinese mechanical repairman who was installing a roof frame at a high altitude, saw this from a distance. He immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Comrade White's spirit of selflessness and devotion to the people is exemplified in his extreme responsibility towards his work and his extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the people. Every Communist Party member should learn from him." He quickly climbed down from the roof frame to repair the machine. Just as Zhao Zhensheng was concentrating on the repair, a 300-kilogram feed hopper suddenly fell, and the steel cable of the mixer severed Zhao Zhensheng's left arm. Despite the doctors' meticulous treatment, due to the severity of the injury, amputation was necessary.

After learning that he had to undergo amputation, Zhao Zhensheng remained very calm and resolutely said, "I have already prepared myself to dedicate my life to the African people. A Chinese worker armed with Mao Zedong Thought, even with one arm, will continue to serve the African people." His selfless spirit and indomitable revolutionary will moved many people around him to tears.

After the amputation surgery, as soon as Zhao Zhensheng regained consciousness, his first thought was not about himself but about the construction of the Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory. He said, "Please tell the comrades not to come to see me. The work on the construction site is busy, and they should not delay work because of me."

To take care of Zhao Zhensheng, the leadership considered sending him back to China for recuperation. However, Zhao Zhensheng firmly insisted on staying to continue working for the Tanzanian people. He said, "Comrade White was a foreigner who dedicated his life to the Chinese revolutionary cause. I am only injured; it is nothing. I can still continue to serve the African people." He wrote this thought in a letter to his wife in China and received her support and encouragement.

Tanzanian friends who have come into contact with Zhao Zhensheng all highly praise his spirit of serving the African people. A Tanzanian medical worker said, "I had not met a Chinese person before. Today, I see the excellent qualities of the Chinese people through him."

In the hospital, Zhao Zhensheng received warm care and attention from Tanzanian doctors, nurses, workers, and even patients, and they formed a deep friendship. Every day, many Tanzanian friends whose names he did not know came to visit him. They expressed their concern and praise in Swahili or through gestures. Some friends specially expressed the African people's respect for the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

When Zhao Zhensheng returned to the construction site after recovering from his injury, the Tanzanian representative on the Friendship Textile Printing and Dyeing Factory construction site, Ugula, said to him, "We will never forget the contribution you have made to the friendship between the Tanzanian and Chinese peoples."

When people see this one-armed Chinese worker, dressed in work clothes, with a tool bag slung over his shoulder, covered in mud and oil, working busily with Tanzanian workers, they are deeply moved. A Tanzanian worker on the construction site said, "The Chinese experts are our true friends."

    用剩下的一只手继续为非洲人民服务
    ——记我援坦工人赵振声同志的动人事例
    在坦桑尼亚首都达累斯萨拉姆市的郊区，由中国援助建设的一座现代化工厂——友谊纺织印染厂，正在全面施工。参加这项工程建设的中国工人赵振声同志在工作中光荣负伤，失去了左臂，但他用剩下的一只手继续为非洲人民服务，这种崇高的国际主义精神，在当地群众中广为传颂。
    去年十月中旬的一天中午，在友谊纺织印染厂工地上，一台由坦桑尼亚工人操作的混凝土搅拌机发生了故障。正在高空安装房架的中国机械检修工赵振声同志从远处看到了这个情景，心里立刻想到毛主席的教导：“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任，对同志对人民的极端的热忱。每个共产党员都要学习他。”他赶紧从房架上下来抢修机器。正当赵振声同志聚精会神地检修时，三百公斤重的进料斗突然落下来，搅拌机的钢丝绳割裂了赵振声同志的左臂，虽经医生的精心治疗，但由于伤势太重，只得进行截肢手术。
    赵振声同志得知必须截肢的消息以后，他非常镇静，毫不犹豫地说：“我已作了为非洲人民贡献自己生命的思想准备。毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人，剩下一只手也要为非洲人民服务。”他的忘我精神和顽强的革命意志使周围的许多人感动得流出了热泪。
    截肢手术后，赵振声同志刚恢复知觉，他首先想到的不是自己，而是友谊纺织印染厂的建筑工程。他说：“请转告同志们不要来看我，工地工作忙，不要为了我耽误工作。”
    为了照顾赵振声同志，领导上曾考虑调他回国休养。赵振声同志却坚决要求留下来继续为坦桑尼亚人民工作。他说：“白求恩同志是个外国人，为了中国的革命事业献出了生命。我只是受伤，算不了什么。我还可以继续为非洲人民服务。”他把这个想法写信告诉了他在祖国的妻子，得到了她的支持和鼓励。
    接触过赵振声同志的坦桑尼亚朋友，对他这种为非洲人民服务的精神，无不热烈赞扬。一位坦桑尼亚医务人员说：“过去我没有接触过中国人，今天我从他身上看到了中国人民优秀的品质。”
    赵振声同志在医院里受到坦桑尼亚医生、护士、工友以至病人的热情关怀和照顾，同他们结下了深厚的友情。每天都有许多不知姓名的坦桑尼亚朋友到病房来看望他。他们用斯瓦希里语或用手势向他表示关切和赞扬。有的朋友特意向他表示非洲人民对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的敬意。
    赵振声同志伤愈返回工地时，友谊纺织印染厂工地坦方代表乌古拉对他说：“我们永远不会忘记你对坦中两国人民之间的友谊所作出的贡献。”
    当人们看到这位独臂的中国工人，身穿工作服，肩挂工具袋，满身泥浆油污，同坦桑尼亚工人一起忙碌地劳动着的时候，无不为之十分感动。工地的一位坦桑尼亚工人说：“中国专家是我们真正的朋友。”
