Guinean friends particularly love to sing the song "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson," which praises Chairman Mao and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. When the Chinese "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe performed in Mamou City, Guinea, two Guinean workers voluntarily requested permission to allow them and their children to go on stage to sing "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson." They sang this song with boundless reverence in Chinese, expressing the Guinean people's love for Chairman Mao and New China.

Once, some members of the Song and Dance Troupe were walking on the street when suddenly they heard the song "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson, All things grow with the sun, Dew nourishes the seedlings, Doing revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought." They turned around and saw a group of young men and women singing this song, welcoming the Chinese friends. When the "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe finished a performance in the Guinean city of Kindia, many audience members sang "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson" together with the troupe members in pouring rain.

Wherever the Song and Dance Troupe went, many Guinean workers, peasants, and students wanted to learn "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson" from the troupe members. When the Song and Dance Troupe first arrived in Pita City, a Guinean friend brought a tape recorder and requested the troupe members to sing three songs: "The East Is Red," "The Sea Voyage Depends on the Helmsperson," and "Long Live, Chairman Mao." He said these three songs express the wishes of all the people of the world. After recording these three songs, he played them for his family and neighbors. He told the Chinese friends that after listening to these three songs, it felt as if they were with New China, red Beijing, and the great leader Chairman Mao.

    高唱《大海航行靠舵手》
      几内亚朋友非常爱唱歌颂毛主席和光辉的毛泽东思想的歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》。当中国“曙光”歌舞团在几内亚城
  市马木演出时，两位几内亚工人主动要求允许他们和他们的孩子一起上台演唱
  《大海航行靠舵手》。他们以无限崇敬的心情用中文唱了这支歌，表达了几内亚人民对毛主席和新中国的热爱。
      有一次，歌舞团的一些演员在街上散步，突然传来了“大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，雨露滋润禾苗壮，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想”的歌声。他们掉转头，看到一群男女青年正在唱这支歌，表示对中国朋友的欢迎。当“曙光”歌舞团在几内亚城市金康的一次演出结束时，许多观众同歌舞团团员一起在倾盆大雨下高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
      歌舞团所到之处，总有许多几内亚工人、农民和学生要向歌舞团团员们学习《大海航行靠舵手》。当歌舞团刚到皮塔城时，一位几内亚朋友带着录音机前来请求歌舞团团员演唱三支歌：《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》和《万岁，毛主席》。他说，这三支歌表达了全世界人民的心愿。他把这三支歌录下来以后，放给家里的人和邻居们听。他告诉中国朋友，他们听了这三支歌，觉得就好象同新中国、红色的北京和伟大领袖毛主席在一起。
