Editor's Note: Lenin pointed out: "If the ideas of revisionism really gain the upper hand within the Party, then it is no longer a socialist party of the working class." Today, the party controlled by the Soviet revisionist leadership is exactly as Lenin pointed out, with revisionist ideas dominating within the party. The traitors to the communist cause—the Soviet revisionist clique—have usurped the party's leadership, implementing a whole set of revisionist lines. This party has degenerated from a Marxist-Leninist party to a revisionist party, and from a proletarian party to a bourgeois party.

Since Khrushchev usurped the party and the government, the great Soviet Communist Party founded by Lenin has been pushed into the abyss of revisionism. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they went even further in this regard. The Soviet revisionist clique, through one purge after another, completely excluded loyal Communist Party members who were dedicated to the communist cause from the party's leadership at all levels. At the same time, they used the excuse of "economy and production first" to place a large number of bourgeois intellectuals in various leadership positions within the party, while most of the worker and peasant cadres were removed. As a result, from the central to the local levels, the Soviet Communist Party is controlled by the bourgeois privileged class and has become a tool of bourgeois dictatorship.

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique repeatedly claims that the Soviet Communist Party has become a "party of the whole people." One of their reasons is that this is due to the "democratic nature" of the party's activities. This argument is utterly absurd. In fact, under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, not only are the democratic rights of the broad masses of the people stripped away, but democratic practices within the Soviet revisionist party have also vanished. Party members are not equal; workers are considered inferior to engineers. Party members who dare to expose and criticize the Soviet revisionist ruling clique are either expelled from the party, arrested, or sent to "mental hospitals." The Soviet revisionist clique practices a pure and simple bourgeois dictatorship over ordinary party members!

Let the "party of the whole people" advocated by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique go to hell! In the Soviet Union, there are tens of thousands of true Bolsheviks who will not yield to the pressure of the Soviet revisionist clique. They stand firmly with the broad masses of the Soviet people and will one day rise up to overthrow the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists, restoring the Soviet Communist Party to its original Leninist, proletarian Bolshevik character.

Look, how the Soviet revisionists have trampled Lenin's party!

Opening the door for ghosts and demons, allowing bourgeois elements to occupy leadership positions at all levels

The traitor clique of Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin, in order to fully restore capitalism and consolidate their reactionary rule, implemented a thorough revisionist party-building principle. They completely betrayed Lenin's party-building theory, allowing various bourgeois representatives to seize leadership positions at all levels of the party, fundamentally changing the proletarian nature of the Soviet Communist Party, turning a Marxist-Leninist party into a revisionist party.

Bourgeois intellectuals control the leadership at all levels of the party

Since Khrushchev usurped the party and government power, there have been one purge after another from the central to the local levels, with a large number of worker and peasant cadres and revolutionary intellectuals being driven out of the party's leadership positions. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they went even further. According to reports, by 1961, nearly 70% of the central committee members elected at the 19th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1952 had been purged.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has long been pushing the "expert line," promoting a large number of bourgeois intellectuals to control the leadership at all levels of the party, causing the party to degenerate from a representative of proletarian interests into a tool serving the bourgeois privileged class.

The Soviet revisionist clique, under the pretext of "economy over politics" and "economic and production issues being at the center of the party's activities and the entire work of the party organization," vigorously promotes and uses "national economic experts," while ruthlessly excluding and replacing a large number of worker and peasant cadres. The Soviet revisionist publication "Communist" openly declares that party leaders must be "experts." Some places even explicitly stipulate that "party members with technical or engineering certificates must be elected as branch secretaries." Because a large number of intellectuals serving the bourgeois privileged class have seized leadership positions at all levels of the party, a large number of worker and peasant old cadres have been replaced. According to a reporter from "Pravda," "every year, two-thirds of the branch secretaries in Leningrad are replaced," and "more and more engineers and designers are becoming party committee secretaries." Even more despicable is that some enterprise units have established a special organization to specifically supervise and replace cadres of worker origin, selecting "young experts."

In recruiting new party members, the proportion of bourgeois intellectuals continues to increase. According to the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee's publication "Party Life," in 1966, 40.6% of the new probationary party members were clerks, of which three-quarters were engineering and technical personnel and experts in various fields of the national economy. While the proportion of ordinary workers and peasants among new party members has significantly decreased. For example, in 1966, the number of peasants among the new party members was only 12.6%. In a certain water plant in Kazakhstan, not a single ordinary laborer was accepted as a member of the Soviet Communist Party. According to statistics, today in the Soviet Union, "one out of every three engineering and technical personnel is a party member, while one out of every seventeen or eighteen workers is a party member. In collective farms, ordinary peasant party members are almost non-existent."

Gathering a large number of social dregs and ghosts and demons into the party

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique abolishes the proletarian party-building principle, gathering a large number of social dregs, ghosts, and demons into the party, turning the vanguard of the proletariat into a chaotic mess.

From Khrushchev to his loyal followers Brezhnev and Kosygin, they openly raise the banner of the "party of the whole people," vigorously promoting the revisionist party-building line, and opening the door wide for various opportunists to infiltrate the party. They even allow landlords, new rich peasants, bourgeois elements, speculators, alcoholics, hooligans, thieves, deserters, and so on to flood into the party. For example, in Lithuania, the process of a certain district party committee developing a party member named Gasiulis is even more absurd. Before joining the party, he clearly wrote in his resume that before the revolution, "he himself was a landlord with one hundred hectares of land." Such a major historical issue did not attract anyone's attention during his party membership review. Later, local residents exposed that he was also a key member of a reactionary sect, and after the German invaders were driven away, he still maintained contact with bourgeois nationalist bandits. Such a genuine landlord and national traitor not only wore the crown of a party member but was also elevated to the position of chairman of a collective farm. The leader of the state farm in Kazakhstan, Avbaklov, was addicted to alcohol, lived a life of debauchery, and engaged in fraud, but the farm party organization forcibly brought him into the party. As a result, before he could even receive his party membership card, he committed another crime. In Latvia, a party organization knew that the person they were developing as a party member was a deserter during the Great Patriotic War, and after serving his sentence, he joined a "theft gang" and hid under an assumed name for seventeen years to avoid punishment, but the party organization still brought him into the party.

Many party organizations, in recruiting party members, engage in "rushes" and "competitions," frantically pursuing quantity and recruiting people by force. Some party organizations stipulate that "each party member must cultivate one person to join the party within ten days." Some party organizations even bring people into the party who have not even applied for membership.

Sending party members who oppose Soviet revisionist rule to "mental hospitals"

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique views true communists who oppose their revisionist rule as enemies, subjecting them to persecution, even arresting and sending them to "mental hospitals."

The Soviet revisionist party is filled with white terror. The broad masses of party members dare not speak their minds. Anyone who expresses dissatisfaction with the current Soviet leadership will suffer unjust persecution. A worker correspondent from the "Turkmen Oil Combine" in Nebit-Dag wrote: "The party constitution requires us party members to carry out criticism and self-criticism, boldly expose shortcomings, and strive to eliminate them. However, when I, as a worker correspondent, only write positive things—everything is fine. When I make criticisms and speak the painful truth, then I am in trouble.... Now some people suggest that I live like this: see nothing, say nothing; know nothing, say nothing." Many party members were persecuted for giving advice to the leadership. For example, in a certain state farm in Saratov Province, party member Barbashov opposed the nomination of the state farm director Petruk as a candidate for the party committee at the party's summary election meeting and exposed his embezzlement of feed and fuel. Six days later, the state farm party organization expelled Barbashov from the party on the grounds of "defaming" the director. Again, a student at a certain college in Moscow was sent to a "mental hospital" for criticizing that "the Soviet Communist Party has become a bureaucratic machine of the power clique," and his parents and brother were also persecuted.

The Soviet revisionist central committee itself admitted that from 1963 to 1965, 100,000 party members were expelled. In 1966 alone, 62,800 party members were expelled. Among them, many were expelled because they insisted on the proletarian stance and resisted and opposed the revisionist goods of the traitor clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin.

From the above points, it is not difficult to see that the great Soviet Communist Party, personally founded by the great revolutionary leader Lenin, has been trampled beyond recognition by the traitor clique of Khrushchev and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin. However, countless true Soviet communists and revolutionaries are still struggling, and they will never yield.

### 看，苏修把列宁的党糟踏成什么样子！

专栏：

    编者按：列宁指出：“如果在党内，修正主义者的思想真的占了上风，那就不是工人阶级的社会主义政党了。”今天由苏修领导集团所控制的苏联共产党，正象列宁所指出的那样，修正主义者的思想在党内占了上风。共产主义事业的叛徒——苏修集团窃据了党的统治地位，推行着一整套修正主义路线。这个党已经从马克思列宁主义政党蜕化成为修正主义政党，从无产阶级政党蜕化成为资产阶级政党。
    自从赫鲁晓夫篡党篡政以来，列宁所缔造的伟大的苏联共产党就被推进修正主义的深渊。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台以后，在这方面比赫鲁晓夫走得更远。苏修集团通过一次又一次的清洗，把党的各级领导中忠于共产主义事业的、正直的苏共党员完全排斥掉。同时，他们借口什么经济、生产第一，把大批资产阶级知识分子安插到党的各级领导岗位，而广大工农干部都被撤换下去。这样一来，苏共从中央到地方，都被资产阶级特权阶层所把持，成为资产阶级专政的工具。
    苏修统治集团口口声声叫嚷什么苏联共产党已成为“全民党”。它的理由之一就是：这是由于党的活动方法的“民主性质”决定的。这种论调是十分荒唐的。事实上在苏修集团的统治下，不仅广大人民群众的民主权利被剥夺，苏修党内的民主也荡然无存。党员都是不平等的，工人要比工程师低一等；敢于揭发批评苏修统治集团的党员，轻则被开除出党，重则被逮捕法办或送入“疯人院”。苏修集团对普通党员实行的也是地地道道的资产阶级专政！
    让苏修统治集团鼓吹的“全民党”见鬼去吧！在苏联，有成千上万的真正的布尔什维克，他们决不屈服于苏修集团的压力，他们坚决与广大苏联人民站在一起，早晚总有一天定会起来推翻苏修的反动统治，使苏联共产党恢复列宁的、无产阶级的布尔什维克的本来面目。
    看，苏修把列宁的党糟踏成什么样子！
    为牛鬼蛇神大开方便之门  让资产阶级分子占据各级领导
    赫鲁晓夫及其继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团，为了全面复辟资本主义、巩固其反动统治，推行了一套彻头彻尾的修正主义建党原则。他们彻底背叛了列宁的建党学说，让各种资产阶级代表人物窃取了党的各级领导，根本改变了苏联共产党的无产阶级性质，使马列主义政党变成了修正主义的党。
    资产阶级知识分子控制党的各级领导
    自从赫鲁晓夫篡夺党政大权以来，从中央到地方，进行了一次又一次的清洗，大批忠于共产主义事业的工农干部和革命知识分子被赶下党的领导岗位。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后更是变本加厉。据报道，一九五二年苏共第十九次代表大会选出的中央委员，到一九六一年有将近百分之七十已被清洗。
    苏修叛徒集团，长期以来极力推行专家路线，提拔大批资产阶级知识分子控制党的各级领导，使党从无产阶级利益的代表者堕落成了为资产阶级特权阶层服务的御用工具。
    苏修集团以“经济重于政治”、“经济问题和生产问题居于党组织活动的中心、居于党组织整个工作的首位”为名，大肆提拔和重用“国民经济专家”，对广大工农干部却肆无忌惮地加以排斥和撤换。苏修《共产党人》公开宣称，党的领导人必须是“专家”。更有甚者，有的地方明文规定“必须选举有技术员或工程师证书的党员担任支部书记”。由于大批为资产阶级特权阶层服务的知识分子窃取了党的各级领导，广大工、农老干部被大量撤换。据《真理报》记者报道，“列宁格勒基层党组织书记每年要撤换三分之二”，“越来越多的工程师、设计师当了党委书记”。尤为恶劣的是，有些企业单位还建立一种特殊组织，专门监督和撤换工人出身的干部，选拔“青年专家”。
    在发展新党员时，资产阶级知识分子所占比重不断增加。据苏共中央刊物《党的生活》透露，一九六六年吸收的苏共预备党员有百分之四十点六是职员，其中四分之三是工程技术人员和国民经济各行业的专家。而新党员中普通工人、农民所占比重大为下降。例如：一九六六年接收的新党员，农民只占百分之十二点六。在哈萨克某水解厂被接收为苏共党员的人中甚至“连一个普通劳动者也没有”。据统计，今日之苏联“每三个工程技术人员中就有一个党员。而工人每十七、八个人中才有一个党员。在集体农庄，普通农民党员更是微乎其微。”
               收罗大批社会渣滓牛鬼蛇神入党
    苏修叛徒集团取消无产阶级建党原则，收罗大批社会渣滓、牛鬼蛇神入党，把无产阶级先锋队变成乌七八糟的大杂烩。
    从赫鲁晓夫到他的忠实门徒勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，公开打着“全民党”的旗号，竭力推行修正主义建党路线，为各种投机分子混入党内大开方便之门。他们竟让地主、新富农、资产阶级分子、投机商、酒鬼、流氓、盗窃犯、逃兵等涌入党内。例如：在立陶宛，某区党委发展一个名叫加修里斯党员的经过，就更为荒唐。该人在入党前，在履历表上就清楚地写着，革命前“他本人是一个拥有一百公顷土地的”大地主。对这样重大的历史问题，在研究他入党时，竟“没有引起任何人的注意”。后来当地居民揭发，他还是一个反动会道门的“骨干分子”，“在德国侵略者被赶走后，他仍和资产阶级民族主义匪徒保持联系。”这样一个地地道道的大地主和民族败类不仅被戴上党员的桂冠，还被捧上集体农庄主席的宝座。哈萨克—国营农场领导人阿夫巴克洛夫，嗜酒成性，生活腐化，弄虚作假，但农场党组织硬把他拉入党内。结果，还未来得及发给他党证，他就又干了坏事。在拉脱维亚，有个党组织明知发展对象在卫国战争期间是个“逃兵”，服刑期满后，又加入“盗窃集团”，并且为“逃避判刑”化名隐居达十七年之久，党组织还是把他拉入党内。
    许多党组织在发展党员时，大搞“突击”、“竞赛”，拚命“追求数量”，拉伕凑数。有的党组织规定“每个党员在十天之内培养一个人入党”。有的党组织甚至“把没有提出入党申请的人”也拉入党内。
            把反对苏修统治的党员送进“疯人院”
    苏修统治集团对不满其修正主义统治的真正的共产党人视为仇敌，横加迫害，甚至逮捕和送进“疯人院”。
    苏修党内充满一片白色恐怖。广大党员群众不敢说真心话。谁如果对苏修现领导表示不满，就要遭到无辜的迫害。涅比特—达加市“土库曼石油联合公司”一个工人通讯员写道：“苏共党章责成我们党员开展批评和自我批评，大胆地揭露缺点和争取消除缺点。但是，当我作为一个工人通讯员，只写正面东西的时候——一切都好。当我提出批评，说出了痛苦的真相，那就倒霉了。……现在有些人建议我这样生活：看到的说没有看到；知道的说不知道。”不少党员因为给领导提了意见，就被加上各种罪名，受到打击报复。例如：萨拉托夫州某区“速度”国营农场党员巴尔巴绍夫在党的总结选举会议上，反对提名国营农场主任彼得鲁克为党委候选人，并揭发他贪污饲料和燃料。事过六天，该国营农场党组织就以巴尔巴绍夫“诽谤”主任为由，把巴尔巴绍夫开除出党。再如：莫斯科某学院一学生，因指责“苏共已变成权力集团的官僚机构”而被投入“疯人院”，其父母和弟弟也遭到迫害。
    苏修中央自己供认，从一九六三年到一九六五年这三年间有十万党员被开除。一九六六年一年就开除了六万二千八百多名党员。这中间有不少人是因为他们坚持无产阶级立场，抵制和反对勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团那一套修正主义货色而被清洗的。
    从以上几点事实不难看出，由伟大的革命导师列宁亲自缔造的伟大的苏联共产党已被赫鲁晓夫及其继承人勃列日涅夫、柯西金叛徒集团糟踏得不成样子。然而无数真正的苏联共产党人和革命者仍在坚持斗争，他们决不会屈服。
