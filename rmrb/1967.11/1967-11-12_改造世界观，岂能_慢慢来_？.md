Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." To transform one's worldview is to struggle against the "selfish" thoughts in one's mind and establish the concept of "public interest."

However, China's Khrushchev has always opposed the transformation of worldview and the struggle against "selfish" thoughts, claiming that "the transformation of worldview can only be done slowly."

Can the transformation of worldview and the struggle against "selfish" thoughts be taken slowly? No, absolutely not.

It is true that the transformation of worldview is a long-term process. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have achieved basic victory in the transformation of the ownership of the means of production, but we have not yet completely won on the political and ideological fronts. The question of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the realm of ideology has not been truly resolved. We must continue the long struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology." As long as there are still classes within the country and abroad, and as long as the influence of the exploiting classes has not been completely eliminated, there will be a struggle between "public interest" and "selfish" thoughts. It is impossible for them to coexist peacefully. If we are to revolutionize for life, we must struggle against "selfish" thoughts for life and transform our thinking for life.

However, the long-term nature of worldview transformation does not mean that we can take it slowly or relax our struggle against "selfish" thoughts. Comrade Yan Siyang, a good soldier of Chairman Mao, said well, "We must struggle against 'selfish' thoughts even if they are just a fleeting idea." We must carry forward the spirit of "seizing the day" in revolution. Everything in the world develops and changes from quantitative to qualitative. The "selfish" thoughts in our minds are the same. If we do not struggle against them in time, they will accumulate and turn into revisionism. If we do not struggle against "selfish" thoughts even if they are just a fleeting idea and do not thoroughly transform our worldview, we will become deserters of the revolution at critical moments.

We, the proletarian revolutionaries, must not allow "selfish" thoughts to freely exist in our minds and corrupt our thinking. We must, with the spirit of "seizing the day" in revolution, resolutely struggle against "selfish" thoughts, day by day, month by month, year by year. Whenever they appear, we must struggle against them, no matter how fleeting the idea, and not let them hide anywhere. In this way, "public interest" will occupy the ideological front, Mao Zedong Thought will arm our minds, and we will be able to stand firm, see clearly, and revolutionize continuously, thoroughly, and forever, forever preserving our revolutionary youth.

The reason why China's Khrushchev spreads the fallacy that "the transformation of worldview can only be done slowly" is that he wants us to abandon class struggle in the ideological realm, let "selfish" thoughts freely spread in our minds, and allow bourgeois ideology to occupy our ideological front, thereby realizing his dream of restoring capitalism.

Recently, Chairman Mao has issued a great call to us to struggle against "selfish" thoughts and criticize revisionism. This is the fundamental policy for us to thoroughly transform our worldview and achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; it is the great program for preventing and opposing revisionism, strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and ensuring that our great motherland will never change color for ten thousand generations; it is the most fundamental task of struggle on the political and ideological front throughout the entire socialist historical period. If some comrades think that "struggling against 'selfish' thoughts and criticizing revisionism" is a long-term task and there is no need to be urgent about it, we can take it slowly, this would exactly fall into the trap of China's Khrushchev, which is very harmful and dangerous. "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support." We proletarian revolutionaries must be a hundred times vigilant and must not be fooled.

### 改造世界观，岂能“慢慢来”？

    改造世界观，岂能“慢慢来”？
    装甲兵第二坦克学校无产阶级革命派
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。改造世界观，就是要斗掉头脑里的“私”字，树立“公”字。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却一贯反对世界观的改造，反对斗“私”，说什么“世界观的改造只能慢慢来”。
    改造世界观，狠斗“私”字，能“慢慢来”吗？不能，绝对不能。
    不错，世界观的改造是长期的。毛主席教导说：“我们已经在生产资料所有制的改造方面，取得了基本胜利，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，我们还没有完全取得胜利。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”只要国内外还有阶级存在，只要剥削阶级的思想影响还没有完全肃清，就存在着“公”与“私”的斗争，不是“公”斗倒“私”，就是“私”斗倒“公”，不可能和平共处。我们要干一辈子革命，就要斗一辈子“私”字，改造一辈子思想。
    但是，世界观改造的长期性，绝不等于可以“慢慢来”，绝不可以放松对“私”字的斗争。毛主席的好战士年四旺同志说得好，狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，要发扬“只争朝夕”的革命精神。世界上一切事物的发展变化都是由量变到质变的。头脑里的“私”字也是一样，不及时斗倒，日积月累，就会变“修”。平时不狠斗“私”字“一闪念”，不彻底改造世界观，关键时刻就会当革命的逃兵。
    我们无产阶级革命派，决不能容忍“私”字在自己头脑里自由自在，让它腐蚀我们的思想。我们必须用“只争朝夕”的革命精神，坚决和“私”字斗，天天斗、月月斗、年年斗，什么时候有就什么时候斗，那怕只是“一闪念”，也毫不放过，斗得它无处躲藏。这样，“公”字占领了思想阵地，毛泽东思想武装了我们的头脑，我们就能立场稳，方向明，不断革命，彻底革命，永远革命，永葆革命的青春。
    中国赫鲁晓夫之所以散布“世界观的改造只能慢慢来”的谬论，其实质，就是要我们放弃思想意识领域里的阶级斗争，让“私”字在我们头脑里自由泛滥，任凭资产阶级思想去占领我们的思想阵地，以实现他复辟资本主义的美梦。
    最近毛主席向我们发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号召，是我们彻底改造世界观，夺取无产阶级文化大革命全面彻底胜利的根本方针；是防修反修，加强和巩固无产阶级专政，使我们伟大祖国千秋万代永不变色的伟大纲领；是整个社会主义历史时期政治思想战线上最根本的战斗任务。如果有的同志认为“斗私，批修”是长期的，何必性急，慢慢来嘛，这就正中了中国赫鲁晓夫的诡计，是十分有害和危险的。“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护”。我们无产阶级革命派务必百倍警惕，千万不可上当。
