Revolutionary workers take on the role of masters in the education revolution

	Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2's revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel, together with Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute's revolutionary teachers and students, criticize the bourgeois education system and enthusiastically propose educational reform ideas. They are determined to carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end with revolutionary teachers and students.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2's revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel have resolutely responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao's "Education must be revolutionized." With the attitude of masters and a high sense of revolutionary responsibility, they have conducted exploratory work on the education revolution with the revolutionary teachers and students of Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute who came to the factory.

	Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2 is a practice factory for Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute, and the workers and technical personnel have extensive contact with the teachers and students of the institute. In August and September this year, the revolutionary teachers and students of the Chemical Engineering Department of Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute formed an "Education Revolution Exploration Team" and came to the factory to conduct investigations and research, which was warmly welcomed by the revolutionary workers. Revolutionary workers expressed that the education revolution is an important part of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is a major issue related to cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. It is a major issue related to our proletarian iron mountain that will never change color for thousands of generations. The education revolution, we revolutionary workers not only want to manage it, but also want to manage it well and manage it to the end!

	The revolutionary workers and technical personnel of Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2, in the process of helping Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute carry out the education revolution, first of all, helped the revolutionary teachers and students to study, apply, and use Chairman Mao's works. They used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to criticize the bourgeois education system and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line represented by Liu Shaoqi. They held more than 20 small and medium-sized seminars and criticism meetings, combining the actual situation of the factory, and criticized the bourgeois education system from various aspects. The revolutionary young people of the exploration team organized the living materials exposed by the workers and helped the worker comrades to organically combine the criticism of the revisionist educational line with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. In this way, the workers' enthusiasm for criticism grew stronger.

	The revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel of Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2, based on the serious study of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," also actively put forward many constructive opinions for the education revolution exploration team. An old worker from the third workshop said to the revolutionary young people of the "exploration team" in a seminar on studying the teaching reform plan, "Among thousands of conditions, the first condition is to highlight Mao Zedong Thought. The education revolution is to make Mao Zedong Thought occupy our school positions. In the school, Mao Zedong Thought is learned well, and the idea of 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people is established, which is more important than anything else!" A worker from the fifth workshop said, "When you formulate the teaching reform plan, you must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching that students should 'study as the main task and learn other things as well,' and you should not spend the whole day reading books like in the past. The school should also put revolution in the first place, carry out class struggle, and criticize the bourgeoisie." Many technical personnel also enthusiastically suggested that in the future, engineering colleges should be linked with factories, and students should often go among the workers, and not study technology by closing the door.

	The education revolution exploration team highly respects the opinions of worker comrades on reforming the education system, teaching policies, and teaching methods. They collected these precious opinions into a book and printed them for the teachers and students who are carrying out the education revolution to read and discuss. With the strong assistance of the revolutionary workers and revolutionary technical personnel of Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2, the education revolution exploration team of Shandong Chemical Engineering Institute formulated a brand-new teaching reform plan.

	After the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the education revolution, the revolutionary committee of Green Island Rubber Factory No. 2 immediately conducted serious study and research. They are determined to carry out the proletarian education revolution to the end with the revolutionary teachers and students who came to the factory to explore teaching reforms.

    让伟大的毛泽东思想占领学校阵地
    革命工人以主人翁姿态投入教育革命
    青岛橡胶二厂革命职工同山东化工学院革命师生一起批判资产阶级教育制度，热情提出教改意见，决心同革命师生一道，将无产阶级教育革命进行到底
    据新华社青岛电　青岛橡胶二厂革命工人和革命技术人员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的“教育要革命”的号召，以主人翁的姿态和高度的革命责任感，同来厂的山东化工学院革命师生一起，进行教育革命的探索工作。
    青岛橡胶二厂是山东化工学院的一个实习厂，工人和技术人员同化工学院的师生有广泛的接触。今年八九月间，山东化工学院化工系的革命师生组成了“教育革命探索队”，来厂进行调查研究，受到革命工人的热烈欢迎。革命工人纷纷表示：教育革命是无产阶级文化大革命的重要组成部分，是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大事，是关系到我们无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代永不变色的大事。教育革命，我们革命工人不仅要管，而且要管得好，要管到底！
    青岛橡胶二厂的革命工人、技术人员，在帮助山东化工学院进行教育革命的过程中，首先是帮助革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想批判资产阶级教育制度，批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义教育路线。他们先后召开了二十多次中小型座谈会、批判会，结合本厂的实际情况，从各个方面对资产阶级教育制度进行了批判。探索队的革命小将把工人揭发出来的活生生的材料整理出来，帮助工人同志把批判修正主义教育路线同本单位斗批改有机地结合在一起，这样工人越批劲头越大。
    青岛橡胶二厂的革命工人、革命技术人员，在认真学习毛主席的“五·七”指示的基础上，还积极地为教育革命探索队出谋划策，提出了许多建设性的意见。第三车间的一位老工人在一次研究教学改革方案的座谈会上，语重心长地对“探索队”革命小将说：“千条万条，突出毛泽东思想是第一条。教育革命就是要使毛泽东思想占领我们的学校阵地。在学校里，毛泽东思想学好了，树立了‘完全’‘彻底’为人民服务的思想，比什么都重要！”第五车间的一位工人师傅说：“你们搞教改方案，可要牢牢记住毛主席关于学生‘以学为主，兼学别样’的教导，不能象过去那样整天啃书本。学校也要把革命放在首位，要搞阶级斗争，要批判资产阶级。”许多技术人员还针对学校教育严重脱离实际、脱离劳动的现象，热情地建议今后的工科院校应该和工厂挂钩，学生要经常到工人中间去，不要关起门学技术。
    教育革命探索队十分尊重工人同志对改革教育制度、教学方针、教学方法的意见，他们把这些宝贵意见汇集成册，印发给正在进行教育革命的师生传阅和讨论。在橡胶二厂革命工人、革命技术人员的大力协助下，山东化工学院教育革命探索队，制订出了一个崭新的教改方案。
    毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示发表以后，青岛橡胶二厂的革命委员会立即进行了认真的学习和研究。他们决心同来厂进行教改探索的革命师生一道，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
