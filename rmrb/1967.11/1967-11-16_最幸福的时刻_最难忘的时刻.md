Our hearts' reddest red sun, our great leader Chairman Mao, received us at 7:30 PM on the evening of November 14. I truly saw Chairman Mao! This is the moment I have longed for day and night, the happiest and most unforgettable moment of my life! At that time, I was holding the red treasure book, and my emotions were extremely stirred. I shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" over and over again. My voice hoarse, I still couldn't stop shouting. Tears of happiness blurred my vision, and I kept wiping my eyes; people in front of me blocked my view, and I moved to get a better look at our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao. My heart was pounding fiercely, my blood was boiling, and a warm current flowed through my entire body. I wished I could fly to Chairman Mao's side immediately, pour out my inner passion, and express my thoughts.

When I saw Chairman Mao walking with vigorous steps, radiant and spirited, in excellent health, my heart was filled with boundless joy: this is the greatest happiness for all the people of our country, and it is also the greatest happiness for all the people of the world. When I saw Chairman Mao waving his hand, it was as if Chairman Mao was saying, "You must study hard, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, reform your worldview, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" In short, no matter how many words I use, I cannot fully express my inner excitement and boundless warmth. Chairman Mao receiving us is the greatest care, the greatest love, the greatest education, the greatest encouragement for us, and it is also our greatest happiness.

At 2 AM on the 15th, on the first page of the latest edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," I recorded this happiest moment. To share this happiness with my comrades, I sent an urgent telegram to our factory's revolutionary committee and all the revolutionary comrades in the factory, encouraging everyone to achieve greater victories in the revolution and production.

That night, my excitement made it hard for me to sleep. In the old society filled with evil, my father was imprisoned for debts, my mother attempted suicide during the hardest times and was rescued, my brother worked for the landlord all year round and was taken away by the Japanese devils to be a laborer. Our family was torn apart, with wives and children separated. I was a little pig herder since I was young, often hungry and cold, with barely any clothes to wear in the cold winter.

A thunderous roar shook the earth! Chairman Mao dispersed the clouds and let this suffering child see the sunlight. I joined the People's Liberation Army, I joined the Communist Party, and since then, under Chairman Mao's guidance and nurturing, under the nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought, I have grown up. After joining the army, it was Chairman Mao who taught me, "Serve the people"; when my work was going smoothly, it was Chairman Mao who reminded me, "Humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to backwardness"; when I encountered difficulties and setbacks in my work, it was Chairman Mao who instructed me, "Resolve to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." ...

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, began. At first, I was hesitant. At this time, Chairman Mao issued a great call: "You must care about state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" I firmly followed Chairman Mao's teachings, cast aside my selfish thoughts, and actively participated in the movement with the broad revolutionary masses. I exposed and criticized the capitalist reactionary line pushed by China's Khrushchev, exposed and criticized the numerous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road, and seized power from them. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, in April, our factory implemented revolutionary great unity by administrative departments, and in June, achieved revolutionary "three-in-one combination." I was elected by the masses to be a standing committee member of the revolutionary committee.

From participating in the revolution to growing up, it is the process of entering the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, the process of being nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Now that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, under this great situation, I must read Chairman Mao's books better, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

In the past, I did not act according to Chairman Mao's instructions enough, and there are still many shortcomings and mistakes in my thoughts and work. This time, Chairman Mao personally received us, which is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest motivation for us. Navigating the sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow with the sun, and revolution relies on Mao Zedong Thought. During my study, I will definitely follow Vice Chairman Lin's instructions to study Chairman Mao's works, "to study with problems, to learn and apply actively, to combine learning with use, to learn urgently what is needed immediately, to see results quickly, and to focus on the 'use'." I will use the greatest willpower and determination, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, reform my worldview. I will expose my selfish thoughts, fight against them, eliminate them, and burn away all the "self" in my mind, sweeping the dust of "self" into the trash can. After returning to the factory, I will definitely, together with the broad revolutionary masses, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, grasp the revolution, promote production, combine the great criticism, and do a good job of the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our unit, carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

### 最幸福的时刻　最难忘的时刻

    最幸福的时刻　最难忘的时刻
    解放军总后勤部工厂毛泽东思想学习班学员　赵青田
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳、我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在十一月十四日晚上七时三十分接见了我们。我真的见到了毛主席！这是我日日夜夜最盼望的时刻，是我一生最幸福最难忘的时刻！在当时，我手捧着红色宝书，我的心情非常激动。我一遍又一遍地高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”嗓子哑了还在不停地喊。幸福的泪花模糊了我的视线，我就不时的擦拭着眼睛；前边的人挡住了我的视线，我就移动一下位置，尽情地看着我们的伟大统帅毛主席。我的心在猛烈地跳动，热血在沸腾，一股暖流通遍了全身。我恨不得一下子飞到毛主席的身边，倾吐我内心的激情，诉说我心里的话。
    当我看到毛主席迈着健壮的步伐，容光焕发，神采奕奕，身体非常非常健康的时候，我的心无限兴奋：这是我们全国人民最大的幸福，也是全世界人民最大的幸福。当我看到毛主席招手时，就象毛主席在说：“你要好好的学习，要斗私批修，改造好你的世界观，要在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功啊！”总之，千言万语也倾吐不完我的内心激动和无比的温暖。毛主席接见了我们，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的爱护，最大的教育，最大的鞭策，也是我们最大的幸福。
    十五日凌晨二时，在最新的《毛主席语录》首页上，我记下了这个最幸福的时刻。为了使我的同志们分享这个幸福，我连夜给我们工厂革命委员会以及全厂的革命同志发去了快信，鼓励全厂同志们夺取革命和生产的更大胜利。
    这天夜里，兴奋的心情使我难以入睡。在万恶的旧社会里，父亲被逼债坐牢，母亲在生活最困难时自杀被救，哥哥常年给地主扛活，又被日本鬼子抓去做劳工，一家人被弄得妻离子散。我从小就是一个放猪娃，吃不饱，穿不暖，隆冬腊月衣不遮体。
    一声春雷，震撼大地！毛主席拨开乌云，使我这受苦的孩子见到了阳光。我参加了解放军，我参加了共产党，从此，我在毛主席的教导培育下，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来。我参军后，是毛主席教导我：“为人民服务”；当我在工作一帆风顺时，是毛主席告诫我：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”；当我工作遇到困难挫折时，是毛主席指示我：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”……
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命开始了。最初，我是畏首畏尾。这时，毛主席发出了伟大号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我坚决按照毛主席的教导，扔掉了私心杂念，和广大革命群众一起，积极投入了运动，揭发批判了中国赫鲁晓夫推行的资产阶级反动路线，揭发批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大量罪恶事实，并从他们手中夺了权。按照毛主席的教导，四月份，我们工厂就按行政部门实行了革命的大联合，六月份，实现了革命的“三结合”。我被群众推举担任了革命委员会的常委。
    我从参加革命到成长起来，就是进毛泽东思想大学校的过程，是毛泽东思想哺育我的过程。现在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。在这大好形势下，我一定要更好地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事。
    过去，我按照毛主席的指示办事做得还不够，我在思想上、工作中还有不少缺点和错误。这次毛主席亲自接见了我们，这是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，干革命靠的是毛泽东思想。我在学习期间，一定按照林副主席指示的那样学习毛主席著作，“要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫。”我要用最大的毅力和决心，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为武器，斗私批修，改造我的世界观。我要亮私，斗私，灭私，把头脑中的一切“私”字烧掉，并把“私”字的灰尘扫进垃圾箱。回厂后，我一定和广大革命群众一起，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，狠抓革命，猛促生产，结合革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，把文化大革命进行到底。
