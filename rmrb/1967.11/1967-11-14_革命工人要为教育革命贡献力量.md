Revolutionary workers must contribute to the educational revolution. The latest instructions from our beloved Chairman Mao on the educational revolution have brought great joy and excitement to the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad masses of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." In carrying out the educational revolution in schools, we must also rely on workers. This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest trust, and greatest encouragement for us revolutionary workers. We revolutionary workers will certainly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions seriously and carry them out resolutely.

In the past, in the factories run by schools, workers did not play the role they should have. Teachers and students engaged in research and design in a very secretive manner, completely detached from workers, wasting a lot of time and national resources. When students went to factories for practical training, they should first learn the selfless, hardworking, and brave qualities of the working class, establish revolutionary class feelings with workers through common labor, and change their worldview. However, in the past, students going to the factory were still taught by teachers, and workers only taught students operational techniques, having no say in the students' learning and political situation. This old way of doing things must be thoroughly criticized.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have enlightened us workers, changing the idea of some people that the educational revolution is just a matter for students and teachers, having nothing to do with workers. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, together with revolutionary students and revolutionary teachers, to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, and contribute our efforts to creating a new educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    革命工人要为教育革命贡献力量
    我们心中的红太阳毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示传来，无产阶级革命派无不为之欢欣鼓舞。毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”在学校中进行教育革命也要依靠工人，这是毛主席对我们革命工人最大的关怀，最大的信任，最大的鼓舞。我们革命工人最听毛主席的话，一定认真学习毛主席的最新指示，并坚决照办。
    过去，在学校办的工厂中，工人起不到应起的作用。教员和学生搞什么研究、设计，非常秘密化，根本不和工人研究，脱离实际，浪费了不少的时间和国家的财产。学生下工厂实习，首先应该是学习工人阶级大公无私、勤劳勇敢的优良品质，要与工人在共同劳动中建立革命的阶级感情，改造自己的世界观。但是，过去学生下厂仍然是由教师讲课，工人只是教学生掌握操作技术，对于学生的学习状况和政治思想状况则无权过问。这一套旧的作法，必须彻底批判。
    毛主席的最新指示，照亮了我们工人的心，改变了一部分人认为教育革命只是学生和教员的事，与工人无关的想法。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，同革命的学生，革命的教员在一起，彻底批判修正主义教育路线，为创建出闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的崭新的教育制度而贡献出我们的一份力量。
