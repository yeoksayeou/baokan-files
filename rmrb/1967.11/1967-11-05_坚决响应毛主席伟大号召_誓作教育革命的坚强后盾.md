Resolutely Respond to Chairman Mao's Great Call
Vow to Be the Strong Backbone of the Education Revolution
Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Workers' Representative Congress Standing Committee

Our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian education revolution are the general mobilization order for the education revolution, the battle cry to thoroughly smash the bourgeois education system, and a great encouragement and support for all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff across the country. The proletariat of our capital city resolutely supports these latest and highest instructions and vows to join the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to carry the education revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao says: "To carry out the proletarian education revolution, we must rely on the broad masses of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, those proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end." The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries at several schools, including Tongji University in Shanghai, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing Normal University, have taken the lead in proposing preliminary ideas and plans for the education revolution. These are revolutionary ideas and plans that shine with the great thought of Mao Zedong. The proletariat of our capital city applauds their daring spirit of breaking the old and establishing the new and resolutely supports their revolutionary actions.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long established the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong thought principle of "education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor." Implementing this principle will cultivate successors who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought and wholeheartedly serve the proletariat, socialism, and the laboring people. However, the Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi, who have infiltrated the Party and usurped the power of education, have crazily opposed and slandered Chairman Mao's educational line for seventeen years, vigorously promoting a bourgeois reactionary educational line. They have brought the educational systems of feudalism, capitalism, and counter-revolutionary revisionism into socialist schools, allowing bourgeois "scholars" and "gentlemen" to take control, implementing the rule of bourgeois "experts" and "professors" in the schools. Their goal is to attempt to cultivate young students into bourgeois successors, serving as their tools for restoring capitalism.

In his brilliant "May 7th Directive," our great leader teaches us: "Students should also follow this principle, focusing on study while also learning other skills, that is, not only studying literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not be allowed to continue." Our great leader has exposed with one stroke the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, politically pronouncing its death sentence. In this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, the broad masses of Red Guard revolutionary youngsters, revolutionary workers, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary cadres have most resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call for "education to be revolutionized," wielding the iron broom of Mao Zedong thought to sweep those bourgeois "scholars" and reactionary authorities into the dustbin of history, to thoroughly eliminate the educational systems of feudalism, capitalism, and counter-revolutionary revisionism, and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, making Mao Zedong thought dominate the entire educational front.

Under the excellent revolutionary situation, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at Tongji University in Shanghai, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing Normal University, under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, have raised high the banner of the education revolution and proposed measures and ideas for the education revolution. We workers have seen that their direction is correct and their path is right. If we proceed in this way, the leadership of the schools will definitely be firmly in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, and the schools will definitely be truly turned into red campuses of Mao Zedong thought.

    坚决响应毛主席伟大号召
    誓作教育革命的坚强后盾
    北京市革命职工代表会议常设委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，是教育革命的总动员令，是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度的进军号，给了全国广大革命师生员工极大的鼓舞，极大的支持。我们首都工人阶级最坚决拥护这一最新最高指示，誓同革命师生员工一起，把教育革命进行到底。
    毛主席说：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”上海同济大学、北京林学院、北京师范大学等几个学校的广大无产阶级革命派，一马当先，作出了关于教育革命的初步设想和初步方案。这是闪烁着伟大的毛泽东思想光芒的革命的设想，革命的方案。我们首都工人阶级，为他们这种敢破敢立的无产阶级革命精神拍手叫好！坚决支持他们的革命行动。
    伟大领袖毛主席早就规定了“教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合”的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的教育方针。按着这个方针办学，就能培养出高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，全心全意为无产阶级、为社会主义、为劳动人民服务的红色接班人和劳动者。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫以及混进党内篡夺教育大权的陆定一之流，十七年来，疯狂反对和诋毁毛主席的教育路线，极力推行一条资产阶级反动教育路线，把封建主义、资本主义、反革命修正主义的教育制度，搬进社会主义的学校里来，让资产阶级“学阀”、“老爷”们，一齐跑了出来，实行资产阶级“专家”、“教授”治校。其目的就是妄图把青年学生培养成为资产阶级接班人，充当他们复辟资本主义的工具。
    伟大领袖毛主席在光辉的“五·七”指示里教导我们：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”我们伟大领袖一针见血地揭露了以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的反革命修正主义教育路线，政治上宣判了它的死刑。在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的红卫兵革命小将、革命工人、革命教师、革命干部，最最坚决地响应毛主席关于“教育要革命”的伟大号召，挥起毛泽东思想的铁扫帚，要把那些资产阶级“学阀”、反动权威扫进历史的垃圾堆，要把封建主义、资本主义和反革命修正主义的教育制度彻底破除，要大树特树毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的绝对权威，使毛泽东思想占领整个教育阵地。
    在大好的革命形势下，上海同济大学、北京林学院、北京师范大学的广大革命师生员工，在伟大的毛泽东思想指导下，高举教育革命的大旗，提出了关于教育革命的措施和设想。我们工人看了，从心眼里感到，他们的方向正确，路走得对。照这样办，学校的领导权就一定能牢牢地掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，就一定能把学校真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
