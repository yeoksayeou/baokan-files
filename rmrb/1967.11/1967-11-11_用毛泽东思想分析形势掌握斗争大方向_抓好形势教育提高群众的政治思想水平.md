The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any other time. The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been mobilized so broadly and deeply.

The Air Force Party Committee held a plenary meeting to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation.

Use Mao Zedong Thought to Analyze the Situation and Grasp the Direction of the Struggle; Strengthen Situation Education to Improve the Political and Ideological Level of the Masses

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 10th, the Liberation Army Daily reported: Comrades participating in the plenary meeting of the Air Force Party Committee enthusiastically welcomed the transmission by the Liberation Army Daily of our great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation. Everyone, with boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for our red sun, Chairman Mao, who is the reddest in our hearts, seriously discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have extremely important practical and historical significance, further pointing the way to a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are the greatest encouragement to the revolutionary people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the world. Everyone expressed their determination to take Chairman Mao's latest instructions as the guideline, use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, and carry out situation education more broadly and deeply. They will firmly establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought, and more consciously carry out all of Chairman Mao's instructions, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any other time."

At the meeting, comrades unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's important evaluation of the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most accurate, comprehensive, and profound analysis of the excellent situation of the Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is a great revolutionary movement related to the fate of all humanity. Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, this revolutionary movement has achieved decisive great victories. It greatly inspires our people to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution and greatly inspires the revolutionary people of the world to wage unyielding struggles against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Comrades from the front lines of "three supports, two militaries" used a large number of vivid examples to illustrate that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, as Chairman Mao teaches, is excellent, not just good. They said that the greatest victory of the Cultural Revolution in the past year is that the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in various places have been exposed, the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao has been firmly established, and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought has been firmly established. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought has been widely popularized throughout the country. The broad revolutionary masses and the Red Guard revolutionary youth read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, think about state affairs, and engage in revolutionary rebellion. In the Cultural Revolution, they have undergone the greatest tempering, raising their ideological revolutionization to a new level. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the whole country and the broad cadres and fighters of our army in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has promoted production, work, and preparedness. Everywhere is a scene of vibrant and spirited revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The important sign of the excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been mobilized so broadly and deeply."

Everyone unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's teachings have given us the strongest weapon for analyzing the situation. In the discussion, they used a large number of vivid facts to illustrate that Mao Zedong Thought combined with the hundreds of millions of people produces a great spiritual and material force, capable of overcoming all obstacles and crushing all resistance, and invincible in the world. They said: The counter-revolutionary bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev was exposed and destroyed in the mobilization of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses; all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits were smashed in the mobilization of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses; Mao Zedong Thought was widely popularized in the mobilization of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. The revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought are pushing the wheel of history forward.

In the discussion, everyone said with great emotion that our greatest leader Chairman Mao has always been most concerned about the masses, most trusted the masses, most attentive to the sentiments of the masses, and most valued the great revolutionary spirit and creative power of the masses. In decades of revolutionary struggle, Chairman Mao has always paid great attention to the emotions, demands, mobilization, and organizational level of the masses, calling on the whole Party to mobilize the masses to overthrow the three big mountains oppressing the Chinese people. In the new period of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, Chairman Mao is even more attentive to the level of consciousness and organizational level of the masses.

When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution just began, Chairman Mao taught us: "This movement is on a large scale and has indeed mobilized the masses. It has great significance for the ideological revolutionization of the people of the whole country." Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the "Sixteen Points," which pointed out: "Whether the Party's leadership dares to mobilize the masses will decide the fate of this Cultural Revolution." Chairman Mao personally approved the first big-character poster in the country, Chairman Mao personally received more than a million Red Guard revolutionary youth, Chairman Mao personally inspected the situation of mass mobilization in North China, Central South, and East China... Chairman Mao's great practice has set a brilliant example for the whole Party.

Many comrades said: Following Chairman Mao's teachings, guiding the army to observe and analyze the situation, we must first focus on the masses. Look at the breadth and depth of mobilizing the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, look at the changes in class forces, and you will have the correct standard. The situation will be clearer and clearer, the more you talk, the brighter your eyes will be, the phenomenon will not confuse you, the difficulties will not scare you, and the "reversals" will not lead you astray.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the development of the movement, there are new things ahead, and new things are endless. Studying the overall situation and its development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to." Comrades participating in the discussion pointed out: The great revolution in China and the world revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao are developing rapidly. New trends, new achievements, new experiences, and new problems in the revolutionary movement are endless. To keep up with the great commander Chairman Mao and the great revolutionary movement led by Chairman Mao, we must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, analyze and summarize the various new problems that arise in the revolutionary movement with Mao Zedong Thought, and educate all cadres and fighters. Some army leaders personally felt that since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary situation has been like a sudden storm, extremely rapid, and many new problems that the army had never seen or heard before. However, with the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze, understand, and summarize new problems, the army can correctly understand Chairman Mao's great strategic decisions for revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, correctly understand the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat, and correctly handle various problems that arise in the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the army has always followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we do.

Everyone believes that the series of extremely important instructions issued by the great leader Chairman Mao in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are based on the most scientific and profound analysis of the situation of the Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao stands the highest and sees the farthest. Chairman Mao is best at grasping the new trends, new achievements, new experiences, and new problems in the movement, guiding the great revolutionary movement, and leading us from victory to victory. In conducting situation education, we must use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and Chairman Mao's greatest revolutionary practice as an example, constantly analyze and summarize the new trends, new achievements, new experiences, and new problems in the movement. Especially when the movement encounters twists and turns, we must educate the army to see the essence and mainstream of the movement, firmly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and advance victoriously along the revolutionary direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

During the discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many comrades pointed out that frequently using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation and educate the army is a top priority for grasping the political direction. The situation is the situation of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and the situation of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie represented by the Chinese Khrushchev. Different classes, standing on different positions, have completely opposite views on the situation. Regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we proletarian revolutionaries and the broad masses of the people say "it's very good," while the imperialists, revisionists, reactionaries, and the likes of Chinese Khrushchev say "it's very bad." Therefore, in the issue of situation education, it inevitably reflects the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. A comrade responsible for a unit that has established merits in "three supports, two militaries" said, in the Cultural Revolution, we always pay attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to analyze the situation, educate the army, criticize various slanders and distortions of the revolutionary good situation that appear in society, and the whole unit stands more firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, firmly carries out and defends Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously improves class consciousness and line struggle consciousness, and firmly grasps the direction of the struggle.

Many units of the Air Force often combine the actual thoughts of the army, using vivid materials heard and seen by the masses, to conduct situation education. In the education, they specially emphasize the good situation of the Cultural Revolution, specially emphasize the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and specially emphasize the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Through education, the cadres and fighters of the army have a deeper understanding of Chairman Mao's great wisdom and greatness, and a deeper appreciation of the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought.

At the meeting, everyone agreed that situation education has not been grasped enough in the past. Everyone resolved to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the future, take "criticize revisionism and repudiate self" as the key link, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, greatly strengthen the army's situation education, and do a good job in the ideological revolutionization of the army. They must respond to Vice Chairman Lin Biao's call to "hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution," closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao, closely follow the great Mao Zedong Thought, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, complete the glorious mission entrusted by the great leader Chairman Mao, and carry the Chinese revolution and the world revolution through to the end, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought forever fly high in all of China and the world.

    全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。
    毛泽东
    空军党委召开全体会议认真学习毛主席关于形势的最新指示
    用毛泽东思想分析形势掌握斗争大方向  抓好形势教育提高群众的政治思想水平
    据新华社十日讯　《解放军报》报道：参加空军党委全体会议的同志，最最热烈地欢呼《解放军报》传达的我们伟大领袖毛主席关于形势的最新指示。大家怀着对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的心情，认真座谈讨论了毛主席的最新指示。大家一致认为，毛主席的最新指示，具有极为重大的现实意义与历史意义，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利更加指明了方向，是对全国革命人民和全世界革命人民最大的鼓舞。大家表示，一定要以毛主席的最新指示为指针，用毛泽东思想分析形势，更加广泛更加深入地开展形势教育，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大毛泽东思想的绝对权威，更加自觉地执行毛主席的一切指示，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    毛主席教导我们：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”
    在座谈会上，同志们一致表示，毛主席对全国文化大革命形势极其重要的评价，最准确、最全面、最深刻地分析了文化大革命的大好形势。我国的无产阶级文化大革命是关系全人类命运的伟大革命运动，这个革命运动在毛主席亲自领导下，取得了决定性的伟大胜利。它极大地鼓舞着我国人民去夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利，极大地鼓舞着世界革命人民向帝、修、反进行英勇不屈的斗争。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    来自“三支”“两军”第一线的部队负责同志，用大量生动的事例说明我国文化大革命，正如毛主席教导的是形势大好，不是小好。他们说，一年来文化大革命最伟大的胜利，是揪出了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们在各地的代理人，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全国大普及。广大革命群众和红卫兵革命小将读的是毛主席的书，听的是毛主席的话，想的是国家大事，干的是革命造反，在文化大革命中，经受了最大的锻炼，把思想革命化提高到一个新的高度。全国人民和我军广大指战员在无产阶级文化大革命中迸发出的革命热情，促进了生产，促进了工作，促进了战备，到处都是一片生气勃勃，意气风发的革命景象。
    毛主席教导我们：“形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”
    大家一致认为，毛主席的教导，给了我们分析形势最强大的武器。他们在座谈中，用大量的生动的事实，说明了毛泽东思想同亿万人民群众相结合，就产生巨大的精神力量和物质力量，就能够无攻不克，无坚不摧，就无敌于天下。他们说：以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命资产阶级司令部，正是在亿万革命群众的发动中被揭露和被摧毁的；一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，正是在亿万革命群众的发动中被打得落花流水；毛泽东思想正是在亿万革命群众的发动中大普及的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，正在推动历史的车轮滚滚向前。
    在座谈中，大家满怀激情地说，我们最伟大的领袖毛主席，一贯最关心群众，最相信群众，最注意群众动向，最看重群众伟大的革命精神和创造力量。在几十年革命斗争中，任何时候毛主席都非常注意群众情绪，群众要求，群众动员和组织程度，号召全党放手发动群众，推翻压在中国人民身上的三座大山，在无产阶级专政下进行革命的新时期，毛主席更是十分注重群众的觉悟水平和组织水平。
    无产阶级文化大革命刚刚开始的时候，毛主席就教导我们：“这个运动规模很大，确实把群众发动起来了，对全国人民的思想革命化有很大的意义。”毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”也指出：“党的领导敢不敢放手发动群众，将决定这场文化大革命的命运。”毛主席亲自批发了全国第一张马列主义大字报，毛主席亲自接见了一千多万红卫兵革命小将，毛主席亲自视察华北、中南和华东地区的群众发动情况……毛主席的伟大实践，给全党树立了最光辉的榜样。
    许多同志说：遵照毛主席的教导，引导部队观察分析形势，要首先把着眼点放在群众身上。看用毛泽东思想发动群众的广度和深度，看阶级力量的变化，就有了正确的标准，对形势，就越看心越明，越谈眼越亮，现象迷不住，困难吓不倒，“反复”不迷航。
    毛主席教导我们：“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”参加座谈的同志指出：我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导的中国革命和世界革命，一日千里地向前发展，革命运动中的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题层出不穷。我们要紧紧跟上伟大统帅毛主席，要紧紧跟上毛主席领导的伟大革命运动，就必须遵照毛主席的教导，对于革命运动中出现的各种新问题，用毛泽东思想加以分析和总结，教育全体指战员。有的部队领导同志亲身感受到，无产阶级文化大革命以来，革命形势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，许多新问题部队过去见所未见，闻所未闻。但是，有伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导，用毛泽东思想分析、认识、总结新问题，部队就能正确理解毛主席的无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的伟大战略决策，就能正确理解无产阶级革命派的革命行动，就能正确对待文化大革命中出现的各种问题。所以，部队始终紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，毛主席怎么说，就怎么做。
    大家认为，伟大领袖毛主席在无产阶级文化大革命中发出的一系列极为重要的指示，就是在对文化大革命形势进行的最科学、最精辟的分析的基础上提出的。毛主席站得最高，看得最远，毛主席最善于抓住运动中的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题，指导伟大的革命运动，引导我们从胜利走向胜利。我们在进行形势教育中，必须以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，以毛主席最伟大的革命实践为榜样，不断分析、总结运动中的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题。特别是在运动出现曲折和反复的时候，教育部队看清运动的本质和主流，坚定地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，沿着毛主席指引的革命方向胜利前进。
    在座谈讨论毛主席的最新指示时，许多同志指出，经常地用毛泽东思想分析形势，教育部队，是掌握政治方向的头等大事。形势，就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的形势，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线同以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线斗争的形势。不同的阶级，站在不同的立场上，对形势就有完全相反的看法。对待无产阶级文化大革命，我们无产阶级革命派和广大人民群众说“好得很”，帝、修、反和中国赫鲁晓夫之流则说“糟得很”。因此，在形势教育问题上，也必然反映了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。在“三支”“两军”中建立了功勋的某部队负责同志说，我们在文化大革命中，时刻注意用毛泽东思想分析形势，教育部队，批判社会上出现的对革命大好形势的各种污蔑、歪曲，全体同志就更加坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决贯彻和捍卫毛主席的革命路线，阶级觉悟、路线斗争觉悟不断提高，牢牢掌握住斗争大方向。
    空军许多部队经常结合部队的思想实际，运用群众耳闻目睹的生动材料，进行形势教育。在教育中，大讲特讲文化大革命的大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。通过教育，使部队指战员更加认识到毛主席最英明、最伟大，更加体会到毛泽东思想的无穷威力。
    座谈会上，大家认为，过去对形势教育抓得还不够。大家决心今后一定要遵照毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，大大加强部队的形势教育，搞好部队的思想革命化。一定要响应林彪副主席“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功”的号召，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，紧跟伟大的毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，完成伟大领袖毛主席赋予我们的光荣使命，把中国革命和世界革命进行到底，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在全中国、在全世界永远高高飘扬。
