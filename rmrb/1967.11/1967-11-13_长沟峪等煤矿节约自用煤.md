The revolutionary cadres and broad masses of workers at Longgouyu and Mucityan coal mines under the Beijing Western Mining Bureau, with the enthusiastic assistance of the People's Liberation Army stationed at the mines, have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great instructions of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "be thrifty to make revolution." While focusing on revolution and vigorously promoting production, they have also paid attention to saving self-used coal, thus saving a large amount of coal for the state.

Statistics show that the self-used coal consumption of Longgouyu Coal Mine from January to September this year has decreased by 17.8% compared to the same period last year; the self-used coal consumption of Mucityan Coal Mine during the same period has decreased by 13.3%. Currently, both mines have established coal-saving offices to strengthen the leadership of coal-saving work.

    长沟峪等煤矿节约自用煤
    京西矿务局长沟峪和木城涧煤矿的无产阶级革命派和广大革命职工，在驻矿人民解放军的热情帮助下，最坚决地执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，在狠抓革命，猛促生产的同时，注意节约自用煤，为国家节约了大量的煤炭。
    据统计，长沟峪煤矿今年一至九月份的自用煤量，比去年同期减少了百分之十七点八；木城涧煤矿今年一至九月份的自用煤量，比去年同期减少了百分之十三点三。现在，这两个煤矿为了加强对节约自用煤工作的领导，都成立了节煤办公室。　（据新华社讯）
