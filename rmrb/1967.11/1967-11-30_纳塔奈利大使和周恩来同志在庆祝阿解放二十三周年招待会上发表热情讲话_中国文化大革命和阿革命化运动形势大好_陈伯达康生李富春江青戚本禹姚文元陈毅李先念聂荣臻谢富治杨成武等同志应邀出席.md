Ambassador Nataneli and Comrade Zhou Enlai delivered enthusiastic speeches at the reception (full text on page 2). Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, extended the warmest congratulations to the great leader of the Albanian people and close comrade of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the glorious Albanian Labor Party, to the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and to the fraternal Albanian people.

The reception was filled with a warm atmosphere of fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Albania. Under the national flags of both countries, comrades from China and Albania, filled with proletarian internationalist friendship, used the most beautiful language to enthusiastically praise the great friendship between China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and to enthusiastically celebrate the brilliant victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and Albania's revolutionary movement. They expressed their determination to stand together and fight together with the Albanian people in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and in the struggle for the victory of socialism and communism.

The reception began with the national anthems of China and Albania.

In his speech, Ambassador Nataneli introduced the great achievements of the Albanian people under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party led by Comrade Enver Hoxha in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He said that the great achievements made by our people in the past 23 years were made in the face of difficulties caused by the backward economy and technology inherited from the past, as well as in the continuous struggle against the sabotage, economic, and military blockade by the imperialists led by the United States and their lackeys, Khrushchev and Tito revisionism. The slogan of "one hand with a gun, the other with a pickaxe" has been consistently carried out by our Party in these 23 years. The attempt by the Soviet revisionist leadership to make the Albanian people and the Albanian Labor Party submit was met with a shameful failure.

The ambassador said that the revolutionary movement in Albania, which is vigorously advancing, has fully mobilized the laboring people of our country to implement the historic resolutions of the Fifth Party Congress and other revolutionary measures taken by the Party. It has dealt a crushing blow to the harmful phenomena that produce and develop revisionism and the restoration of capitalism. Our Party is determined to carry the proletarian revolution to the end in all fields, making socialist Albania, as Chairman Mao said, "a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

Ambassador Nataneli enthusiastically praised the fraternal friendship between Albania and China. He said that the great friendship that has withstood severe tests binds the Albanian people and the Chinese people together. No force in the world can infringe upon this friendship; it is unbreakable because it has been tempered by the two great Marxist-Leninist parties and the great leaders Mao Zedong and Enver Hoxha, and it will be continuously strengthened. The ambassador said that a year ago, Chairman Mao's historic telegram to our Party's Fifth National Congress was the highest expression of Albanian-Chinese friendship. In the hearts of every Albanian people, the immortal words of Chairman Mao are written in golden letters: "Although China and Albania are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are connected. We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades." "Believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together." Our people, party, and government feel happy and proud of this friendship and are determined to defend it from any enemy's intrusion and to strengthen it under any circumstances.

The ambassador enthusiastically praised the great victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, initiated and led by Chairman Mao Zedong, the faithful successor of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist of our time, not only has great historical significance for the fate of China but also for the people of all countries fighting for freedom and independence, for all revolutionary and liberation movements, and for the international communist movement. The Cultural Revolution has mobilized 700 million Chinese people to study and master Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has great theoretical and practical significance for further enriching scientific socialism.

The ambassador said that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great Chinese people have shown to the world that the banners of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, the October Revolution, and the Chinese revolution will forever fly high and pure over revolutionary China. The existence of a powerful revolutionary people's China led by the great Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao Zedong is a decisive factor in defending the revolution and an important factor in the struggle for liberation by the peoples of all countries and oppressed nations.

The ambassador said that the People's Republic of Albania has consistently pursued a correct and principled foreign policy based on Marxist-Leninist principles, serving to strengthen the independence, sovereignty, and international status of the People's Republic of Albania, and the interests of the revolutionary and socialist cause. Imperialism and revisionism have never been able to isolate the People's Republic of Albania geographically. Albania on the Adriatic Sea, just as great China on the Pacific Ocean, will forever hold high the revolutionary red flag and be a strong warrior supporting the oppressed and freedom-loving peoples of all countries.

Comrade Zhou Enlai, in his speech, praised the Albanian people for, under the leadership of the Labor Party, holding high the banner of struggle against imperialism led by the United States, and for the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people for holding high the banner of struggle against modern revisionism, making great contributions to the defense of Marxism-Leninism. He praised the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people for insisting on the socialist path, continuously consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieving brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. He praised the Albanian people for, under the leadership of their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, launching a magnificent great revolutionary movement.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the revolutionary movement shows that the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has creatively applied and developed Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of the country. This is of extremely great significance for preventing revisionism and preventing the restoration of capitalism in Albania. The Albanian people are heroic people standing tall and firm. The Albanian Labor Party is a glorious Marxist-Leninist party. The beloved leader of the Albanian Party and people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a great Marxist-Leninist. Albania is a great beacon of socialism, continuously emitting brilliant light, illuminating the path of liberation for the European peoples.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has achieved decisive victories. As our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before." The task before us now is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, widely establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, deeply carry out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, overcome the influence of various non-proletarian thoughts from the right and "left," further promote the great criticism, great alliance, and the three-in-one combination of revolution, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of each unit, promote production and preparedness for war, and do a better job in all aspects of work. At the same time, we must continue to maintain revolutionary vigilance, expose and unmask the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

Premier Zhou Enlai strongly condemned the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries, who, in order to resist the great influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, are further colluding to stir up an anti-China reverse current. The more the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries act in such a reactionary manner, the more they will only end up hurting themselves. The reactionary reverse current will never be able to change the overall good situation in the world.

Comrade Zhou Enlai said that the world belongs to the people. We believe that as long as we follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of struggle against imperialism, unite all those who oppose imperialism and colonialism, firmly support the armed struggle of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, firmly support the revolutionary movements of the peoples of all countries, and carry the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys to the end; hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet revisionist clique to the end, we will definitely be able to establish a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

Premier Zhou Enlai enthusiastically praised the unbreakable friendship between China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. He said that Comrade Mao Zedong, in his telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, solemnly declared: "Believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely stand together, fight together, and win together." The Chinese people will forever follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against imperialism, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against modern revisionism, and firmly support the Albanian people's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries, whether they oppose Albania or China, must count China and Albania together.

The speeches by Ambassador Nataneli and Comrade Zhou Enlai were met with thunderous applause from the entire audience.

Those invited to attend the reception also included leaders from various government departments, leaders from various headquarters, military branches, and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, leaders from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, and representatives from revolutionary mass organizations in the capital. Among them were Wang Shusheng, Li Tianyou, Wang Xinting, Qiu Huizuo, Xiao Jinguang, Li Zuopeng, Yu Lijin, Zhang Xiuquan, Zheng Weishan, Fang Yi, Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Zhang Zaiwo, Chu Tuonan, Wu De, Liu Sichang, Zhao Zhipi, Lin Xiaomang, and Li Dongmin.

    新华社二十九日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利今晚举行盛大招待会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年。
    中央和中央文革小组负责同志以及其他方面的负责同志周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、戚本禹、姚文元、陈毅、李先念、聂荣臻、谢富治、杨成武、吴法宪、汪东兴、叶群、郭沫若、刘宁一等，应邀出席了招待会。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员、不管部长谢·佩奇同志，和由他率领的阿中友协代表团，出席了招待会。
    纳塔奈利大使和周恩来同志先后在招待会上发表了热情洋溢的讲话（全文见第二版）。周恩来同志代表我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志，向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    招待会上洋溢着中阿两国人民之间的战斗友谊的热烈气氛。在悬挂着中阿两国国旗的招待会会场上，中阿两国同志满怀无产阶级国际主义的友情，用最美好的语言，热烈赞颂由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的伟大的中阿友谊，热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命和阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动取得的辉煌胜利，表示中阿两国人民在反对帝、修、反的斗争中，在为实现社会主义和共产主义胜利的斗争中，永远团结在一起，战斗在一起。
    招待会开始时，乐队奏中国国歌和阿尔巴尼亚国歌。
    纳塔奈利大使在讲话中介绍了阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得的辉煌胜利。他说，我国人民在这二十三年期间所取得的伟大成就，是在同过去遗留下来的落后的经济技术所造成的困难，以及在反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其仆从赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义的种种破坏、经济军事封锁的不断的斗争中取得的。在这二十三年中始终贯穿着我们党的“一手拿枪、一手拿镐”的口号。苏共修正主义领导集团要使阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党屈服的企图，遭到了可耻的失败。
    大使在谈到阿尔巴尼亚胜利开展的革命化运动时说，对党的第五次代表大会的历史性决议和党所采取的其他革命化措施的贯彻，把我国的劳动人民群众充分地发动起来了，对于产生、发展修正主义和复辟资本主义的危害现象给予了摧毁性的打击。我们党有决心把各个领域里的无产阶级革命进行到底，使社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚象毛泽东主席所说的永远是“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”。
    纳塔奈利大使热情称颂阿中两国之间的战斗友谊，他说，经历了严重考验的伟大友谊把阿尔巴尼亚人民和中国人民联结在一起，世界上没有任何力量能侵犯这一友谊，它是牢不可破的，因为这是由我们两个马克思列宁主义党和两国伟大的领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志所锤炼起来的，它将日益不断地得到加强。大使说，一年以前，毛泽东主席给我们党的第五次全国代表大会的历史性的贺电是阿中友谊的最高的表现。在每个阿尔巴尼亚人民的心坎里，都用金光闪闪的字眼写下了毛泽东主席的不朽的词句：“中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。”“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”我国人民、党和政府为这一友谊感到幸福和自豪，并决心维护它免受任何敌人的侵害，在任何情况下都要不断地加强它。
    大使热烈赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利。他说，由马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的忠诚的继承者、当代杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席亲自发动、领导的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅对中国的命运，而且对争取自由和独立的各国人民，对一切革命和解放运动，对国际共产主义运动，都具有非常伟大的历史意义。文化大革命动员了七亿中国人民来学习和掌握毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想对进一步丰富科学社会主义具有伟大的理论意义和实践意义。
    大使说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，伟大的中国人民向全世界表明，马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的旗帜、十月革命的旗帜和中国革命的旗帜，将永远纯洁地、高高地飘扬在革命中国的上空。伟大的杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席领导的、强大的革命的人民中国的存在，是保卫革命的一个决定性的因素，是各国人民和被压迫民族争取解放的一个重要的因素。
    大使说，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国一贯奉行建立在马克思列宁主义原则基础之上的，为加强阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的独立、主权和国际地位，为革命和社会主义事业利益服务的正确的原则性的对外政策。帝国主义、修正主义在地理上的包围从来也不能孤立阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国。阿尔巴尼亚在亚得里亚海边上，正象伟大的中国在太平洋边上一样，将永远高举革命的红旗，永远作支持受压迫、热爱自由的各国人民的坚强战士。
    周恩来同志在讲话中，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党领导下，高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战斗旗帜，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反对现代修正主义的大旗，为捍卫马克思列宁主义作出了巨大的贡献，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持走社会主义的道路，不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就，赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，掀起的气势磅礴的伟大的革命化运动。
    周恩来同志说，革命化运动表明，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党根据本国具体情况，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。这对于在阿尔巴尼亚防止修正主义和防止资本主义复辟，具有极其重大的意义。阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的英雄人民。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是光荣的马克思列宁主义的党。阿尔巴尼亚党和人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志是伟大的马克思列宁主义者。阿尔巴尼亚是一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯，它不断发射出灿烂的光辉，照耀着欧洲人民争取解放的前进道路。
    周恩来同志说，一年多来，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”现在摆在我们面前的任务是：更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，广泛开办毛泽东思想学习班，深入展开斗私批修运动，克服来自右的和“左”的方面的各种非无产阶级思想的影响，进一步推动革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，抓革命促生产，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好，同时，要继续保持革命的警惕性，识破和揭穿阶级敌人的破坏活动，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    周恩来总理强烈谴责以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，为了抵制中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，正在进一步勾结起来，掀起一股反华的逆流。帝、修、反如此倒行逆施，其结果只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。反动的逆流，终究改变不了国际形势大好的主流。
    周恩来同志说，世界是属于人民的。我们相信，只要按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，团结一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，坚决支持越南人民和亚、非、拉人民的武装斗争，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命运动，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底；高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，团结一切革命的马克思列宁主义者，把反对以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，我们一定能够建立起一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。
    周恩来总理热情称颂由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的、建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的、牢不可破的中阿友谊。他说，毛泽东同志在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大的贺电中，庄严地宣称：“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”中国人民将永远遵照毛泽东同志的教导，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民反对帝国主义的斗争，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民反对现代修正主义的斗争，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，反阿也好，反华也好，都必须把中阿两国计算在一起。
    纳塔奈利大使和周恩来同志的讲话，在全场激起一阵阵雷鸣般的热烈掌声。
