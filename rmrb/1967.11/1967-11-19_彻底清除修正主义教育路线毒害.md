Our Cao Chang Primary School in Beijing is an extremely ordinary elementary school. However, even such a school was not spared by the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. For a long time, they have been instilling the wrong ideas of "academics first" and "college entrance first" into the students, causing them to suffer serious harm.

Once children enter the school, teachers from the classroom to extracurricular activities constantly propagate the idea of "all other professions are inferior, only studying is noble." The school's motto is "everything gives way to teaching." There is no morning exercise, less rest during lunch, and late bedtimes. Labor is replaced by self-study. A twelve or thirteen-year-old teenager studies for twelve to fourteen hours a day. Apart from studying, there are countless exams. Especially in the sixth grade, the methods of examination are truly bizarre: vocabulary tests, mental arithmetic drills, arithmetic diagnostics... Sometimes, while students are concentrating in class, a test paper suddenly bursts through the door, causing everyone to be taken aback. The heavy study load seriously affects the students' health. Apart from nearsightedness, it is common for students to faint during assemblies or on the playground. The policy of "academics first" leads the majority of teachers and students astray, neglecting politics. Before the Cultural Revolution, studying Chairman Mao's works was not valued in our school. Study groups formed by students to study Chairman Mao's works often had to disband due to the heavy burden of homework.

The victims of the revisionist educational line are not only the students but also the majority of teachers. In our school, anyone who does not follow the revisionist educational line is subjected to criticism and discrimination. Teachers who serve as sixth-grade class leaders are like passing through a gauntlet; when the students graduate, the teachers fall ill. If a class has good academic performance and a high college entrance rate, praise and promotions come one after another; otherwise, there are public criticisms and small meetings for criticism.

In the educational revolution, through exposing and criticizing the revisionist educational line, we deeply realize that if education does not undergo a revolution, the socialist state won the revolutionary martyrs with their heads and blood will soon change color. We are determined, under the personal leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, to carry this revolution to the end and contribute all our strength to establishing a new educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    彻底清除修正主义教育路线毒害
    北京草厂小学　苑国旺
    我们草厂小学在北京市是一个极其普通的小学校。但是就这样，党内最大的一小撮走资派也不放过它。他们长期以来，向学生灌输了“智育第一”、“升学第一”的错误思想，使学生受到严重毒害。
    孩子进到学校，学校教师就从课堂到课外，处处事事向学生宣扬“万般皆下品，唯有读书高”的思想。学校中“一切都为教学让路”，早晨不上操，中午少休息，晚上迟睡觉，劳动改为自习。一个十二、三岁的青少年，每天学习时间长达十二到十四小时。除了学习以外，还有数不清的考试。特别是六年级，考试的方法真是千奇百怪，什么字词抽测、口算练习、算术摸底……，有时学生正在聚精会神上课，突然之间一张考卷就破门而入，弄得大家惊惶失措。过重的学习负担严重影响了学生的健康，近视眼不说，学校中常常发生学生晕倒在集会上、运动场上的现象。智育第一的方针把广大师生引入忽视政治的歧途。文化大革命以前，在我们学校中学习毛主席著作是得不到重视的，同学中自动组织起来的毛主席著作学习小组常常因为作业负担过重被迫解散。
    修正主义教育路线的受害者，不仅是学生，同时还有广大老师。在我们学校，谁不执行修正主义教育路线就受到打击和歧视。担任六年级班主任的老师真是如同过关，学生毕业了，老师也病倒了。那一班学习成绩好，考试升学率高，表扬晋级接踵而至；相反，则是大会点名，小会批评。
    在教育革命中，通过对修正主义教育路线的揭发批判，我们深深认识到：教育不革命，无数革命先烈抛头颅，洒热血换来的社会主义江山，不要多久就会变颜色。我们决心在伟大领袖毛主席亲自领导下，把这场革命进行到底；为建立起一个闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新学制，贡献自己全部的力量。
