The "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" of the Dominican Republic praises the great victory of China's Cultural Revolution

	Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time

	Denouncing the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and the world's revolutionary people

	New China News Agency, November 14th: Santo Domingo News: The "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" of the Dominican Republic recently issued a statement denouncing the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for fully restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, betraying Marxism-Leninism and the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and colluding with American imperialism to carry out counter-revolutionary plans. The statement points out that due to the true Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary peoples of the world, under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, have formed an impregnable wall of steel, the counter-revolutionary plans of the traitor clique cannot be realized.

	The statement praises China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution as an unprecedented revolution in human history, a reliable guarantee for the victory of the world proletarian revolution.

	The statement of the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" points out that the Khrushchev revisionist clique seized the power of the Party, government, and military through a "palace" coup, "implementing policies that betray Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and the cause of communism, betraying the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries and proletarian internationalism, surrendering to American imperialism, and cooperating with American imperialism in their plans to rule the world."

	The statement says: "On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the great victory of the October Socialist Revolution, we, the revolutionaries of the world, denounce the traitors, splitters, and renegades led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, who have usurped the leadership of the Party, army, and state established by the great Lenin and consolidated by Stalin, attempting to turn the wheel of history backward, restore capitalism in the Soviet Union, help American imperialism in its attempt to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the heroic Vietnamese people, and betray the revolutionary interests of the peoples of Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other regions of the world."

	The statement emphasizes: "However, this gang of traitors, splitters, and betrayers of Marxism-Leninism cannot realize their counter-revolutionary and anti-communist plans, because the true Marxist-Leninist parties and revolutionary peoples of the world, under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought—the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time—have risen up against them and their accomplices, forming an impregnable wall of steel. The glorious and correct Chinese Communist Party is their acknowledged vanguard, they are loyal to the path of the October Revolution, proletarian internationalism, Marxism-Leninism, and the cause of socialism and communism."

	In discussing the great significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, for the world proletarian revolution, the statement says:

		"The great helmsman of the heroic Chinese people, the highest teacher of the world proletarian revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong, has summarized the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat internationally, and has drawn important lessons from the fact that the Khrushchev revisionist clique has usurped the leadership of the Party and state in the Soviet Union. He personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is developing victoriously on the vast territory of the great People's Republic of China.

		"The great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sounded the death knell for all capitalist remnants in China, as well as for the imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries."

	The statement finally calls on all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world to strengthen their struggles, expose and defeat the invasion and betrayal plans of the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and all their accomplices and lackeys.

    多米尼加“六·一四革命运动”赞扬中国文化大革命取得伟大胜利
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马列主义者
    谴责苏修背叛马列主义和世界人民革命事业
    新华社十四日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加“六月十四日革命运动”最近发表声明，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团在苏联全面复辟资本主义，背叛马克思列宁主义和各国人民的革命斗争，伙同美帝国主义推行反革命计划。声明指出，由于全世界真正的马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导下形成了坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁，叛徒集团的反革命计划不可能实现。
    声明赞扬中国无产阶级文化大革命是人类历史上空前未有的革命，是世界无产阶级革命取得胜利的可靠保证。
    “六月十四日革命运动”的声明指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团通过“宫庭”式政变窃取了党、政、军的大权，“执行的政策是背叛马克思列宁主义、社会主义和共产主义事业，背叛各国人民的革命斗争和无产阶级国际主义，向美帝国主义投降以及同美帝国主义在统治世界的计划中实行合作的政策。”
    声明说：“在伟大的十月社会主义革命胜利五十周年之际，我们世界各国的革命者谴责以苏共领导集团为首的一伙叛徒、分裂主义者和变节者，正是他们篡夺了伟大的列宁建立的、斯大林巩固的党、军和国家的领导权，企图使历史的车轮向后倒转，在苏联复辟资本主义，帮助美帝国主义妄图扑灭英雄的越南人民的革命烈火，出卖亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界其它地区的人民的革命利益。”
    声明强调提出：“但是，这伙叛徒、分裂主义者和马克思列宁主义的背叛者不可能实现他们的反革命反共计划，因为全世界真正的马克思列宁主义政党和革命人民在光焰无际的毛泽东——当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者——思想指导下，起来反对他们及其同伙，形成了坚不可摧的铜墙铁壁。光荣的、正确的中国共产党是他们公认的先锋队，他们忠于十月革命的道路、无产阶级国际主义、马克思列宁主义以及社会主义和共产主义的事业。”
    声明在谈到由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命对世界无产阶级革命的伟大意义时说：
      “英雄的中国人民的伟大舵手、世界无产阶级革命的最高导师毛泽东同志总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，并且从赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺苏联党和国家的领导权一事中吸取了重要的教训，他亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命，这个革命正在伟大的中华人民共和国的国土上胜利地发展。
      “无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利为中国资本主义的一切残余、以及为帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派敲响了丧钟。”
    声明最后号召全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民加强他们的斗争，揭露和击败以美国为首的帝国主义者、以苏共领导集团为首的现代修正主义者以及所有他们的同谋者和走狗的侵略和背叛计划。
