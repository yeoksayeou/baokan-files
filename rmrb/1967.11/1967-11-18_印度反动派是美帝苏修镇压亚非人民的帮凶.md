	Consistently Using International Conferences to Sabotage the Unity of Asian, African, and Latin American Peoples in Their Struggle Against Imperialism

	Indian reactionaries are henchmen of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in suppressing the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 15th, our correspondent reports: Under the direction of U.S. imperialism, the Indian reactionaries recently took the initiative to organize an international conference on the so-called "peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis." Its purpose is to serve the interests of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism, suppressing the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people.

	In recent years, an important means by which the Indian reactionaries have served the interests of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism is to use various international conference venues to act as henchmen and defenders of the U.S. and Soviet revisionism in their aggression and deception of the revolutionary peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. They spread the terror of war everywhere, advocating that oppressed nations should "coexist peacefully" with imperialism, engage in "economic cooperation," and strengthen the United Nations together, willingly submitting to the slavery of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. They also vigorously peddle the "philosophy of non-violence," luring the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to abandon armed struggle and allowing reactionaries to slaughter revolutionary people at will. The Indian reactionaries also try every means to incite other countries to be anti-China, sabotaging the common cause of Asian, African, and Latin American peoples uniting to struggle against imperialism. The Indian newspaper *Politician* bluntly states: "India and other Asian and African countries have nothing in common, neither in national interests nor in emotional relations." India's participation in various international conferences is to "utilize all possible international platforms to promote India's purposes and interests."

	If one reviews what evil deeds the Indian reactionaries have done in some international conferences in the past, one can easily see the conspiracies they played in the so-called international conference on the "peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis" that ended on the 14th.

	At the first Conference of Non-Aligned Nations (September 1-6, 1961), the ugly face of the former Indian Prime Minister Nehru, who pushed the counter-revolutionary conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, was fully exposed. At the conference, many representatives of Asian and African countries strongly condemned imperialism and colonialism, expressing their determination to struggle against imperialism and colonialism. Nehru, however, took the opposite stance, blathering about how the "typical era of colonialism has passed and died." He vigorously advocated that Asian, African, and Latin American countries should not rely on force to achieve independence but should "politely and in a friendly manner" strive to "influence and persuade" imperialism to "take the peaceful path," and not just "condemn and anger them."

	At the second Conference of Non-Aligned Nations (October 5-10, 1964), India attempted to incite anti-China sentiments but met with a shameful failure. At that time, just before China's first successful nuclear test, Indian Prime Minister Shastri actually proposed that the conference "send a special delegation to persuade China to stop manufacturing nuclear weapons," which was opposed by the majority of the attending countries. In his speech, Shastri did not mention anti-imperialism, especially opposition to U.S. imperialism, but instead vigorously promoted Gandhi's "philosophy of non-violence." He strongly advocated "full support" for the U.S.-controlled United Nations and for non-aligned countries to follow India's example in providing troops for the United Nations to act as international police for U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. He also lured Asian and African countries into believing the lies of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism about achieving economic development through "international cooperation." When drafting the conference resolution, the Indian representative insisted on placing the issue of "peaceful coexistence" at the top, which was rejected by the majority of countries. The Indian *Free News* lamented that the conference "resulted in great disappointment."

	At every "Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference," Indian representatives followed the Soviet revisionists, engaging in sabotage and divisive activities, attempting to turn the conference into an anti-China venue. During the "Third Asian-African People's Solidarity Conference" held in Moshi, Tanzania, in February 1963, Indian representatives, in collusion with Soviet revisionist representatives, exaggerated the horrors of war, saying things like "either mutual destruction or coexistence," attempting to stop the Asian and African peoples from waging revolutionary war. They advocated that imperialism could use the money saved from disarmament to "help" Asian and African countries, spreading illusions about colonialists. When drafting the conference resolution, the Indian representative, with the "enthusiastic support" of the Soviet revisionist representative, used the Sino-Indian border issue to propose an anti-China motion. When the conference chairman rejected this motion, the Indian representative shamelessly threatened to withdraw from the drafting committee, declaring that "without India, there would be no (Asian-African solidarity) organization." The Indian delegation's unreasonable behavior and frenzied anti-China actions were severely condemned by many representatives. However, the Soviet revisionist representatives praised "India for sending a brave delegation."

	Even these few facts are sufficient to prove that the Indian reactionaries never miss any opportunity to use various international conference venues to sabotage the unity of the Asian, African, and Latin American peoples in their struggle against imperialism.

### 印度反动派是美帝苏修镇压亚非人民的帮凶

    一贯利用国际会议破坏亚非拉人民团结反帝事业
    印度反动派是美帝苏修镇压亚非人民的帮凶
    据新华社十五日讯本社记者报道：在美帝国主义的指使下，印度反动派最近出面策划召开所谓“和平解决中东危机”的国际会议，其目的是为美帝、苏修效劳，压制阿拉伯人民反帝斗争。
    印度反动派近年来为美帝苏修效劳的一个重要手段，就是利用各种国际会议场合，充当美帝苏修侵略和蒙骗亚非拉革命人民的帮凶和辩护士。他们到处散布战争恐怖，宣扬被压迫民族要与帝国主义“和平共处”，进行“经济合作”，共同“加强联合国”，甘受美帝苏修的奴役。他们还竭力贩卖“非暴力哲学”，诱骗亚非拉人民放弃武装斗争，让反动派任意屠杀革命人民。印度反动派还想方设法煽动其他国家反华，破坏亚非拉人民团结反帝的共同事业。印度《政治家报》毫不隐讳地说：“印度和其它亚非国家之间没有什么共同之处，不论在民族利益或感情关系上都是这样。”印度参加各种国际会议，就是要“利用一切可能利用的国际讲坛，来促进印度的目的和利益”。
    人们只要回顾一下印度反动派过去在一些国际会议上干了些什么罪恶勾当，也就不难看出它在十四日结束的所谓“和平解决中东危机”国际会议上玩弄的阴谋。
    在第一次不结盟国家会议上（一九六一年九月一日——六日），印度前总理尼赫鲁为美帝苏修推行反革命阴谋的丑恶嘴脸就已暴露无遗。会上，许多亚非国家代表强烈谴责帝国主义和殖民主义，表示要为反帝反殖而坚决斗争。尼赫鲁却大唱反调，胡说什么“典型的殖民主义时代已经过去了，死亡了”。极力鼓吹亚非拉国家“不要靠武力”来争取独立，而要“有礼貌地本着友好的态度”，来“争取、影响和诱导”帝国主义“走和平的道路”，不要“光是谴责和激怒它们”。
    在第二次不结盟国家会议上（一九六四年十月五日——十日），印度企图煽动反华，遭到可耻失败。当时正值我国第一颗原子弹爆炸成功前夕，印度总理夏斯特里居然要求会议“派遣一个特别代表团去说服中国停止制造核武器”，遭到多数与会国的反对。夏斯特里在演说中，只字不提反帝特别是反对美帝国主义，却大肆宣扬甘地的“非暴力哲学”。他极力鼓吹要“全力支持”美帝操纵的联合国，要不结盟国家效法印度为联合国“提供部队”，去为美帝苏修充当国际警察。他还诱骗亚非国家相信美帝苏修那套所谓通过“国际合作”来实现经济发展的谎言。草拟大会决议时，印度代表又坚持要把“和平共处”问题放在首位，为多数国家所否决。印度《自由新闻》哀叹，大会“结果令人非常伤心”。
    在历次的“亚非人民团结大会”上，印度代表都紧跟苏修，进行破坏和分裂活动，阴谋把大会变成反华场所。一九六三年二月在坦噶尼喀的莫希地方举行“第三届亚非人民团结大会”时，印度代表与苏修代表一唱一和，大肆渲染战争的恐怖，说什么“或是互相毁灭，或是共处”，企图阻止亚非人民进行革命战争。他们宣扬帝国主义可以用裁军节省下来的钱来“帮助”亚非国家，散布对殖民主义者的幻想。在起草大会决议时，印度代表在苏修代表的“热烈支持”下，利用中印边界问题提出一项反华提案。当大会主席拒绝这一提案时，印度代表竟然以退出起草委员会相要挟，无耻地扬言“没有印度就没有（亚非团结）组织”。印度代表团这种无理取闹、疯狂反华的行径，受到许多代表的严厉谴责。然而，苏修代表却称赞“印度派来了一个勇敢的代表团”。
    仅举以上事实，就足以证明印度反动派从不放过任何机会利用各种国际会议场合，来破坏亚非拉各国人民团结反帝事业。
