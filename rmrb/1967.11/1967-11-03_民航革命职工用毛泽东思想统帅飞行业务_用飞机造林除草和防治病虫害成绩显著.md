In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers and cadres of China's civil aviation system have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible in battle. They have used revolution to guide production and used Mao Zedong Thought to guide flight operations. This year, specialized flights have completed the annual plan four months ahead of schedule, exceeding it by 7%. Among these, agricultural and forestry flights (weed control, seeding, and pest prevention) have completed the annual plan by exceeding it by 13%, surpassing the highest production level in previous years. Aerial forest protection has also completed the annual plan by exceeding it by 28%. This is another glorious achievement of the broad revolutionary workers and cadres of China's civil aviation system in actively implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production." It is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

With the assistance of relevant departments, China's civil aviation has actively contributed to the great harvest of this year's agricultural production in the fields of aerial pest prevention, weed control, seeding, and forestation, achieving new results. This year, in many places in Northeast, North China, East China, and Central South China, the outbreak of stick insects was relatively serious. This voracious pest is ferocious and extremely detrimental to the growth of crops. To ensure a bumper harvest of grain crops in these regions, civil aviation dispatched a large number of aircraft to spray insecticide powder. In Henan Province alone, dozens of aircraft were sent to nine counties and cities to spray pesticides to prevent stick insects, with good results. In cotton-producing regions such as Hubei, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Xinjiang, civil aviation also dispatched a large number of aircraft this year to spray pesticides to prevent cotton pests, contributing to the bumper harvest of cotton. Generally, the efficiency of spraying pesticides by aircraft is over 80%. This year, the area of aerial seeding and forestation in China has far exceeded the original plan. According to statistics from provinces and regions such as Guizhou, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Guangxi, Hunan, Yunnan, and Sichuan, the area of aerial seeding and forestation is approximately equal to the total area of aerial seeding and forestation in these provinces and regions over the past three years.

In China, the use of aircraft for spraying pesticides, weed control, pest prevention of crops, and aerial seeding and forestation began in 1958. Aerial spraying for weed control has the advantages of saving time, increasing yield, high efficiency, good quality, and low cost. According to investigations by relevant departments in Heilongjiang Province's Heshang Farm, after aerial weed control, the average height of wheat increased by 7.4%, and the average yield per hectare increased by 25.5%. From the crop harvest situation of various units using aerial spraying for weed control, the average yield per hectare generally increased by 10% to 15%. In the past, the Yunnan pines sown by aircraft in the Southwest region have grown into large forests. The Masson pines sown by aircraft in the Central South region and the black pines sown by aircraft in the East China region are also growing vigorously and will soon form forests.

This year, the broad revolutionary workers and cadres of China's civil aviation system have made new contributions to supporting agricultural production and achieved new results. This is a fruitful result of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary workers and cadres of the civil aviation system thoroughly criticized the revisionist black goods promoted by Liu Shaoqi in the civil aviation system and, in the course of criticism, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, raised their class consciousness, and promoted the thought revolution of the people. They have directed the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution towards supporting agricultural production.

### 民航革命职工用毛泽东思想统帅飞行业务  用飞机造林除草和防治病虫害成绩显著

    民航革命职工用毛泽东思想统帅飞行业务
    用飞机造林除草和防治病虫害成绩显著
    据新华社三十一日讯  在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，我国民航系统的广大革命职工和革命干部，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以革命统帅生产，用毛泽东思想统帅飞行业务，今年专业飞行提前四个月超额百分之七完成全年计划。其中，农林业飞行（除草、播种和防治病虫害）超额百分之十三完成年度计划，超过了历年来最高生产水平，航空护林也超额百分之二十八完成全年计划。这是我国民航系统广大革命职工和革命干部积极贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的又一辉煌成果，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。
    我国民航在有关部门的大力协助下，为夺取今年农业生产大丰收，积极地贡献了自己的力量，在用飞机防治病虫害、除草、播种造林等方面，作出了新的成绩。今年，我国东北、华北、华东、中南等地区的不少地方粘虫发生较严重，这种暴食性害虫来势凶猛，对农作物的生长极为不利。为了保障这些地区粮食作物的丰产丰收，民航调集了大量的飞机喷撒杀虫药粉，仅河南一省就派出数十架飞机在九个县市喷撒农药防治粘虫，效果很好。在盛产棉花的湖北、江苏、安徽、新疆等地，今年民航也出动大批飞机喷撒（洒）农药，防治了棉花的病虫害，为夺取今年棉花大丰收贡献了力量。各地普遍反映，飞机喷撒（洒）药粉（液）的杀虫效率一般都在百分之八十以上。今年，我国飞机播种造林面积大大超过原定计划，据贵州、广东、浙江、广西、湖南、云南、四川等省区统计，用飞机播种造林面积大约相当于这几个省区过去三年飞机播种造林面积的总和。
    在我国，使用飞机喷药除草、防治农作物病虫害和播种造林，是从一九五八年开始的新事物。用飞机喷药除草具有保农时，增产量，效率高，质量好，成本低的优点。据有关部门在黑龙江省鹤山农场的调查，用飞机除草后，小麦株高平均增加百分之七点四，每公顷平均增产百分之二十五点五。从使用飞机喷药除草的各单位农作物收获情况看，每公顷一般都可以增产百分之十到百分之十五。过去在西南地区用飞机撒播的云南松已经大面积成林，在中南地区航播的马尾松和在华东地区航播的黑松，也都生长旺盛，即将成林。
    今年我国民航系统的广大革命职工和革命干部为支援农业生产作出了新贡献，取得了新成绩，是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果。在文化大革命中，民航系统的广大革命职工和革命干部彻底地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫在民航系统所推行的修正主义黑货，并在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，提高了阶级觉悟，促进了人的思想革命化。他们把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，用到了支援农业生产中去。
