The capital held a grand gathering to celebrate the glorious day of the heroic Albanian people—the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation. The event also praised the fraternal friendship between the Chinese and Albanian parties and peoples, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism.

Li Fuquan, Yao Wenyuan, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Guo Moruo, and other leading comrades attended the meeting.

The delegation led by Comrade Shefqet Peçi of the Albanian-China Friendship Association, Albanian Ambassador to China Nata-Neli, and other Albanian comrades in Beijing also attended the meeting.

The atmosphere at the celebration was filled with the spirit of unity and struggle between the Chinese and Albanian peoples. The stage was adorned with portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the national flags of both countries. As the Albanian comrades entered the venue, the entire audience chanted, "Mao Zedong—Enver! Enver—Mao Zedong!" for a long time.

The celebration began with the national anthems of Albania and China. The entire audience recited Chairman Mao's quotation:

"'Across the sea, there are friends; across the sky, neighbors we be.' Though China and Albania are separated by mountains and seas, our hearts are united. We are your true friends and comrades. You are our true friends and comrades. We are not those who speak sweetly but harbor ill intentions, nor are we two-faced. Our revolutionary and fighting friendship has withstood the test of storms and tempests."

The audience also recited Comrade Enver Hoxha's quotation:

"The fraternal and rock-solid friendship between our party, government, and people with the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people will last forever. Neither distance nor mountains and seas can separate us. In good times and bad, we will always stand together like brothers."

Vice Chairman Guo Moruo presided over the meeting.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Premier of the State Council, and Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee, spoke first at the meeting. He conveyed the warmest holiday greetings from the people of Beijing to Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people, the glorious Albanian Labor Party, and the heroic Albanian people.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that over the past 23 years, under the wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Labor Party, the heroic Albanian people have consistently held high the revolutionary banner of Marxism-Leninism, persisted in socialist revolution, and upheld proletarian dictatorship. They have achieved brilliant victories in socialist revolution and construction, and in the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet revisionist clique. Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Heroic Albania, a great socialist beacon in Europe, is an unshakable revolutionary fortress standing by the Adriatic Sea and a reliable base for the world proletarian revolution."

Comrade Xie Fuzhi praised the Albanian Labor Party and people for upholding the battle cry of "self-reliance, one hand with a hoe, the other with a gun, building socialism." Despite the blockade and sabotage by imperialism and modern revisionism, they have transformed their country from a backward agricultural nation into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture. The heroic Albanian people are advancing bravely along the socialist road, and every achievement they make brings us great joy.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi enthusiastically praised the great victories of Albania's revolutionization movement. He said that under the guidance of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party, a nationwide revolutionization movement has been launched vigorously. Comrade Enver Hoxha's programmatic speech on February 6 and the announcement by the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party and the Council of Ministers on April 29 have initiated a new high tide in further deepening the revolutionization movement. Opposing bureaucracy, streamlining organizations, and rotating cadres between central and local levels; reducing high salaries and narrowing wage gaps; cadres and intellectuals working alongside workers and peasants, directly participating in production; opposing individualism and advocating personal interests subordinated to collective interests; opposing economism and prioritizing political and ideological work; reducing private plots and livestock to further consolidate the socialist position in rural areas; educating the younger generation with revolutionary spirit, going to the mountains and countryside, and participating in voluntary labor; eliminating all remnants of discrimination against women, fully liberating women; opposing religious superstition and backward customs, promoting atheism; advocating guns and hoes on the stage of arts, etc. He said that Albania's revolutionization movement is a vivid manifestation of the Albanian Labor Party, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively applying Marxism-Leninism to the country's revolutionary practice. It not only has profound significance for Albania in preventing capitalist restoration and consolidating proletarian dictatorship but also enriches the experience of international proletarian dictatorship.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that the Albanian Labor Party, led by the great Marxist-Leninist Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a truly tested Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party. Our people are proud to have such a great comrade in Albania.

When talking about the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that after more than a year of the Cultural Revolution, the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in our country have been fully mobilized, and the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought has been widely spread. Our great socialist motherland has never been so prosperous, so flourishing, and so strong.

He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has received the enthusiastic support of Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world, especially the Albanian Labor Party and people, who have highly evaluated and strongly supported our Cultural Revolution. We express our heartfelt thanks.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi pointed out that American imperialism is the most vicious enemy of the people of the world, and the Soviet revisionist clique is the number one accomplice of American imperialism. To oppose imperialism, one must also oppose revisionism. He strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist clique for constantly plotting to hold an anti-China, anti-Albania, and anti-Marxism-Leninism counter-revolutionary black meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist clique and American imperialism are colluding to actively plot a reactionary "holy alliance" against communism, the people, and revolution, particularly targeting China and Albania, attempting to isolate the two countries. He said, we must warn those anti-China and anti-Albania clowns that opposing China is opposing Albania, and opposing Albania is opposing China. The parties and peoples of China and Albania will forever be united, fighting together, and victorious together. Your anti-China and anti-Albania actions will only meet with complete failure.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi said that the friendship between the parties and peoples of China and Albania was personally forged by our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and is based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism. This is a revolutionary, fighting, and proletarian class friendship, the greatest and most precious friendship in the world. Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "The parties and peoples of China and Albania should unite, all Marxist-Leninists in the world should unite, and all revolutionary people in the world should unite to overthrow imperialism, overthrow modern revisionism, and overthrow the reactionaries of all countries. A new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation will definitely be established." The Chinese people will definitely follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and fight shoulder to shoulder with the heroic Albanian people and all revolutionary people in the world to accomplish this glorious historical task.

Liu Sichang, a representative of the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards of Higher Education Institutions, and Red Guards of Secondary Schools, spoke at the meeting. He wished the great leader of the world revolutionary people, the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! He also wished the great Marxist-Leninist, the great leader of the Albanian people, and the closest comrade of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, eternal life! Eternal life!

Liu Sichang said that the friendship between the peoples of China and Albania is the most precious, revolutionary, and fighting friendship in the world. The unity between the peoples of China and Albania is the strongest unity. We, the workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary youngsters of China, and all revolutionary people in the world, are proud to have such a great and strong comrade in Albania.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi, leader of the Albanian-China Friendship Association delegation, began his speech amid enthusiastic applause. He said, "I take this opportunity to convey the most enthusiastic revolutionary greetings from the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, the People's Republic of Albania, and our beloved leader Comrade Enver Hoxha to you."

Comrade Shefqet Peçi enthusiastically congratulated the brilliant victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and once again expressed the firm support of the Albanian people for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is personally initiated and led by the great leader of the Chinese people and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao Zedong. This revolution is overthrowing and smashing a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the Chinese Khrushchev who have infiltrated the party and government leadership and attempted to drag socialist China back onto the capitalist road. The flames of this revolution are burning the reactionary thoughts of the bourgeoisie and revisionists. This revolution is pushing the socialist revolution and construction in China forward, thus setting a brilliant example and making extremely valuable contributions to the world revolutionary cause.

He emphasized that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the victory of Mao Zedong's revolutionary line over the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, the victory of Marxism-Leninism over revisionism, and the victory of revolution over counter-revolution. The historical significance of this revolution transcends the borders of China. The victory of this revolution has inspired all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries in the world and has shown the way for true communists in countries where revisionists are in power. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has inspired and encouraged the oppressed people of the world and the working class in capitalist countries to engage in class struggle.

He said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the destruction of the headquarters of the bourgeoisie led by the Chinese Khrushchev, is the achievement of the revolutionary workers and peasants and the brave Red Guards, and the result of Chairman Mao's far-sighted leadership who fully trusts and relies on the masses and his Marxist-Leninist thoughts. We are genuinely delighted by each of your achievements and regard your victories as our own.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi introduced the great achievements made by the heroic Albanian people under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Labor Party in holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, in the struggle against American imperialism and Khrushchev revisionism, and in socialist revolution and construction. He said that recently, our party and government have taken a series of measures to further revolutionize national life. Under the inspiration of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Labor Party and some specific measures recently taken by the party, an unprecedented revolutionary high tide has been launched throughout the country. In the process of further deepening the socialist revolution in the fields of ideology and culture, our party has taken a series of measures to transform people's thoughts and revolutionize people's thinking. These measures have greatly consolidated the proletarian dictatorship of the People's Republic of Albania, aiming to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in our country.

When talking about the current favorable international situation, Comrade Shefqet Peçi strongly condemned the collusion between the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their frenzied opposition to China and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that today, China has become the main stronghold of revolution and socialism and the invincible banner of Marxism-Leninism. The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with the great revolutionary thoughts of Chairman Mao are invincible. China will forever advance towards the glorious peak of socialism and communism and will forever hold high the banner of revolution and Marxism-Leninism.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi said that the Albanian people led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and the glorious Chinese people led by Comrade Mao Zedong are completely united. The unbreakable friendship and unity between the two peoples of Albania and China have delighted all revolutionary people and true Marxist-Leninists and have struck fear into the hearts of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries.

Comrade Shefqet Peçi said that our two parties, two peoples, and two countries will forever be united, forever hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, and resolutely fight against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered around the Brezhnev and Kosygin traitor clique, and international reactionaries.

All the speeches at the meeting were met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause.

After Comrade Shefqet Peçi's speech, on behalf of the Albanian-China Friendship Association, a banner embroidered with "Long Live the Fighting Friendship Between the Peoples of Albania and China" was presented to the China-Albania Friendship Association.

At the end of the meeting, the orchestra played "Long Live the Albanian Labor Party" and "The East Is Red."

Today's meeting was jointly organized by the China-Albania Friendship Association, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Farmers' Congress, Red Guards of Higher Education Institutions, and Red Guards of Secondary Schools. Also present at the celebration were Wang Shusheng, Wu De, Qiao Guanhua, Chu Tunan, and other responsible comrades and representatives from relevant sectors.

After the celebration, the revolutionary cultural workers of the Beijing Military Region performed revolutionary songs and dances from China and Albania, enthusiastically celebrating the great day of the Albanian people. (With photos)

    新华社二十八日讯　首都革命群众今天隆重集会，热烈庆祝英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民的光荣节日——阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年，热情赞颂中阿两党、两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的战斗友谊。
    李富春、姚文元、李先念、谢富治、郭沫若等负责同志出席了大会。
    由谢·佩奇同志率领的阿中友协代表团，阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利和使馆工作人员，以及在京的其他阿尔巴尼亚同志，出席了大会。
    庆祝大会上充满着中阿两国人民团结战斗的友谊气氛。主席台正中高悬着伟大领袖毛主席像和恩维尔·霍查同志像，高挂着中阿两国国旗。阿尔巴尼亚同志走进会场时，全场长时间地欢呼：“毛泽东—恩维尔”、“恩维尔—毛泽东”。
    庆祝大会开始，乐队奏阿、中两国国歌。全场齐声朗读毛主席语录：
    “‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。我们是你们真正的朋友和同志。你们也是我们真正的朋友和同志。我们和你们都不是那种口蜜腹剑的假朋友，不是那种两面派。我们之间的革命的战斗的友谊，经历过急风暴雨的考验。”
    齐声朗读恩维尔·霍查同志语录：
    “我们党、我国政府和我国人民同中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民结成的兄弟般的、坚如磐石的友谊将万古长青。不管是迢迢万里，还是高山和海洋，都阻挡不住我们。不管在美好的日子里还是困难的日子里，我们将象亲兄弟一样永远在一起。”
    大会由郭沫若副委员长主持。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、国务院副总理、北京市革命委员会主任委员谢富治同志首先在大会上讲话。他代表首都人民向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志，向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，致以最热烈的节日祝贺。
    谢富治同志说，二十三年来，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，一贯坚定地高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，坚持社会主义革命，坚持无产阶级专政，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争中都取得了辉煌的胜利。我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”她是屹立在亚得里亚海边的坚不可摧的革命堡垒，是世界无产阶级革命的一个可靠的根据地。
    谢富治同志赞扬说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持“自力更生，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，建设社会主义”的战斗口号，不顾帝国主义、现代修正主义的封锁和破坏，把自己的祖国从一个落后的农业国变成为具有现代化工业和集体化农业的先进的社会主义国家。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民正沿着社会主义的康庄大道奋勇前进，阿尔巴尼亚人民取得的每一个成就都使我们感到欢欣鼓舞。
    谢富治同志热烈赞扬阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动取得的巨大胜利。他说，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的指引下，阿尔巴尼亚全国性的革命化运动轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。恩维尔·霍查同志今年二月六日的纲领性讲话，四月二十九日阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议公告，掀起了进一步深入开展革命化运动的新高潮。反对官僚主义，精简机构，下放干部；中央和基层之间有计划的、经常的轮换干部；降低高工资，缩小工资差别；干部、知识分子同工农一道，直接参加生产劳动；反对个人主义，提倡个人利益服从集体利益：反对经济主义，提倡把政治思想工作放在第一位；减少自留地和自留牲畜，进一步巩固农村社会主义阵地；以革命精神教育青年一代，上山下乡，参加义务劳动；破除一切歧视妇女的旧思想残余，彻底解放妇女；反对宗教迷信和落后习俗，宣传无神论；提倡枪和镐走上文艺舞台等等。他说，阿尔巴尼亚的革命化运动是以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党把马克思列宁主义创造性地运用于本国革命实践的生动表现，它不仅对于阿尔巴尼亚防止资本主义复辟、巩固无产阶级专政具有深远的意义，而且丰富了国际无产阶级专政的经验。
    谢富治同志说，以伟大的马克思列宁主义者恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，是久经考验的真正的马克思列宁主义革命党，兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的英雄的人民。我国人民为有阿尔巴尼亚这样伟大的战友而感到万分自豪。
    在谈到我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和亲自领导的无产阶级文化大革命取得的伟大胜利时，谢富治同志说，经过一年多来的文化大革命，我国亿万革命群众充分发动起来了，光焰无际的毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及。我们伟大的社会主义祖国，从来没有象今天这样兴盛，这样繁荣，这样强大。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命受到全世界马克思列宁主义者和革命人民的热情支持，特别是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民对我国文化大革命更是高度评价和大力支持，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    谢富治同志指出，美帝国主义是全世界人民最凶恶的敌人，苏修叛徒集团是美帝国主义的头号帮凶。反帝必须反修。他强烈谴责苏修叛徒集团一直策划召开反华、反阿尔巴尼亚、反马克思列宁主义的反革命黑会。他指出，苏修叛徒集团和美帝国主义串通一气，积极策划拼凑一个反共、反人民、反革命的“神圣同盟”，特别把矛头指向中国和阿尔巴尼亚，妄图孤立我们两国。他说，我们要正告那些反华、反阿尔巴尼亚的小丑们，你们反对中国，就是反对阿尔巴尼亚，反对阿尔巴尼亚，就是反对中国。中阿两党、两国人民是永远团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起的。你们反华、反阿，只会遭到彻底的失败。
    谢富治同志说，中阿两党、两国人民之间的友谊是中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志亲自缔造的，是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则基础上的。这种友谊是革命的友谊，战斗的友谊，无产阶级的阶级友谊，是世界上最伟大、最珍贵的友谊。我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“中阿两党、两国人民团结起来，全世界马克思列宁主义者团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，打倒帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒各国反动派。一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界，一定要建立起来。”中国人民一定遵照毛主席的伟大教导，同英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和全世界革命人民并肩战斗，为完成这个光荣的历史任务而奋斗到底。
    北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中等学校红代会代表刘锡昌同志在讲话中，敬祝世界革命人民的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！敬祝伟大的马克思列宁主义者、阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民最亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    刘锡昌说，中阿两国人民之间的友谊，是世界上最珍贵的、革命的、战斗的友谊，中阿两国人民之间的团结，是最坚强的团结。我们中国工农兵群众、红卫兵革命小将和全世界革命人民以有阿尔巴尼亚这样伟大坚强的战友而感到自豪。
    阿中友协代表团团长谢·佩奇同志应邀在热烈的掌声中开始讲话。他说，我借此机会向你们转达阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，和我们敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志本人的最热烈的革命敬礼。
    谢·佩奇同志热烈祝贺中国无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌胜利，并且再一次表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国无产阶级文化大革命的坚决支持。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是中国人民的伟大领袖、卓越的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席亲自发动和领导的。这场革命正在打倒和粉碎钻入党政领导、妄图把社会主义中国拉回资本主义道路上的以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，这场革命的烈火正在焚烧着资产阶级的和修正主义的反动思想，这场革命正在把中国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设推向前进，从而为世界革命事业作出了光辉的榜样和极为宝贵的贡献。
    他强调说，无产阶级文化大革命是毛泽东同志的革命路线对中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命路线的胜利，是马克思列宁主义对修正主义的胜利，是革命对反革命的胜利。这场革命的历史意义超越了中国的国界。这场革命的胜利，鼓舞了全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命者，并给修正主义者当权的国家中的真正的共产党人指明了道路。无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞和激励着全世界被压迫人民和资本主义国家的工人阶级去进行阶级的搏斗。
    他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的被摧毁，是革命的工农群众和英勇的红卫兵的功绩，是充分相信群众和依靠群众的毛泽东主席的卓有远见的领导和他的马克思列宁主义思想的成果。我们为你们的每一个成就而感到由衷的喜悦，并且把你们的胜利看作是我们的胜利。
    谢·佩奇同志介绍了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的劳动党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义大旗，在反对美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中所取得的巨大成就。他说，最近，我们党和政府采取了一系列有关国家生活进一步革命化的措施。在劳动党第五次代表大会的各项决议和党最近所采取的一些具体措施的鼓舞下，我们国内普遍掀起了一个前所未有的革命高潮。在思想和文化领域内的社会主义革命进一步深入开展的过程中，我们党采取了一系列改造人的思想和人的思想革命化的措施。这些措施大大地巩固了阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国的无产阶级专政，目的是要防止在我国产生修正主义和复辟资本主义。
    谢·佩奇同志谈到当前大好的国际形势时，强烈谴责美帝和苏修相互勾结，疯狂反对中国，反对中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，今天，中国已经成为革命和社会主义的主要堡垒，成为马克思列宁主义不可战胜的旗手。用毛泽东主席伟大的革命思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可战胜的。中国将永远朝着社会主义和共产主义的光辉的顶峰前进，并将永远高举革命和马克思列宁主义的旗帜。
    谢·佩奇同志说，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导的阿尔巴尼亚人民和以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党领导的兄弟的中国人民，是完全团结一致的。阿中两国人民之间的牢不可破的友谊和团结，使所有的革命人民和真正的马克思列宁主义者欢欣鼓舞，使帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派胆战心惊。
    谢·佩奇同志说，我们两党、两国人民和两国将永远团结在一起，将永远高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，将同以美国为首的帝国主义，同以勃列日涅夫和柯西金叛徒领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，同国际反动派进行坚决的斗争。
    大会上所有的讲话，都在全场激起了一阵阵热烈的掌声。
    谢·佩奇同志讲话以后，代表阿中友协把一面绣着“阿中两国人民的战斗友谊万岁”的锦旗，赠给中阿友协。
    大会结束时，乐队奏《万岁！阿尔巴尼亚劳动党》和《东方红》。
    今天的大会，是由中阿友协、对外友协、北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会和中等学校红代会联合举办的。参加庆祝大会的，还有王树声、吴德、乔冠华、楚图南等各有关方面的负责人和代表。
