The South Vietnamese military and people have achieved another series of victories in the third quarter of this year, annihilating more than 82,000 enemy troops, including over 32,500 American invaders and nearly 3,000 puppets. They have also shot down and destroyed 747 enemy aircraft.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on October 31st, the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency reported that the Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in South Vietnam recently issued a combat report announcing that the South Vietnamese military and people achieved a brilliant victory in the third quarter of this year, annihilating more than 82,000 enemy troops. Among the annihilated enemy forces were 32,500 American invaders and nearly 3,000 puppet troops.

The report stated that following the brilliant victories achieved last winter and this spring, the South Vietnamese military and people, in the months of July, August, and September, annihilated ten enemy battalions and equivalent units, four armored units, eighty-eight companies, and one hundred seventy-nine platoons. They also shot down and destroyed 747 enemy aircraft, destroyed and damaged 1,180 various military vehicles, destroyed 133 artillery pieces of different calibers, sank seventy-six warships and boats, blew up eight locomotives and twenty train cars, captured ninety-four forts and seventy-one guard towers, blew up seventy-eight bridges and sixty-seven culverts, and burned fifty-two ammunition depots and nineteen fuel storage facilities with a total capacity of 18 million liters.

The report said that compared to the same period last year, the number of enemy troops annihilated increased by one fold, the number of aircraft shot down increased by one fold, the number of military vehicles destroyed and ships sunk increased by more than one fold, and the number of armored vehicles destroyed increased by two folds.

The report pointed out that during these three months, the People's Liberation Armed Forces launched attacks and counterattacks everywhere, coordinating closely on each battlefield and between different battlefields, annihilating and heavily defeating a large number of enemy forces. They skillfully and flexibly employed various tactics, achieving many outstanding results.

The report said that during this period, military and civilian forces in various places frequently attacked the enemy on land and water transportation lines, combining large, medium, and small-scale battles to not only annihilate a large number of enemy troops but also to tie down and disperse many of the enemy's forces. To defend against attacks by the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the enemy had to deploy six to eight battalions of American troops along the Route 9 line. The first, thirteenth, fourteenth, twentieth, and fifteenth strategic routes were paralyzed due to frequent damage and blockades.

The report said that these three months saw the most attacks on the enemy's rear bases. Twelve provincial capitals, forty county seats, and rear bases such as Quang Tri, Hue, Da Nang, Hoi An, Quang Ngai, Phan Rang, Dalat, Long Khanh, Phu Yen, Ninh Thuan, Ninh Hoa, and Cao Lang, as well as a series of airports including Phu Cat, Soc Trang, Da Nang, Vung Tau, Can Tho, Qui Nhon, Dong Ha, and others, were subjected to fierce attacks by military and civilian forces from various parts of the South. During this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces were able to simultaneously attack many of the enemy's military targets.

The People's Liberation Armed Forces also penetrated deep into many enemy-occupied areas, striking at the enemy's "pacification" activities, assisting local people in rising up for political and armed struggles, and vigorously developing guerrilla warfare in many places.

The report finally called on the People's Liberation Armed Forces to redouble their efforts and resolutely achieve even more brilliant victories this winter and spring, ultimately defeating the American aggressors.
