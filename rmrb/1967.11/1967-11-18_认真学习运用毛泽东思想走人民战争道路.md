The Indonesian publication of the Asia-Africa Peoples' Solidarity Organization, *Voice of the Indonesian People*, recently published an editorial enthusiastically welcoming the publication of the Indonesian edition of the first volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*.

The editorial states: "The first volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* has been published in Indonesian. The publication of this book is a very valuable and very important internationalist contribution from the Chinese people and the Communist Party of China to the Indonesian people and the Indonesian proletariat and its vanguard, the Communist Party of Indonesia."

The editorial points out that "the publication of the first volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* in Indonesian, as well as the publication of the Indonesian edition of *Quotations from Chairman Mao* in May this year, are all victories in the many victories achieved in various aspects of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and are also victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!"

The editorial says: "The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, led personally by Chairman Mao Zedong and illuminated by the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, has smashed the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, making all the hopes and dreams of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries for a capitalist restoration in China come to naught. The Cultural Revolution, with its irresistible momentum and thunderous force, is sweeping away all obstacles set up by the handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road with Chinese Khrushchev as their chief. The movement to spread, propagate, study, and apply Mao Zedong Thought is developing on an unprecedented scale. The work of publishing the works of Chairman Mao is advancing by leaps and bounds. Revolutionary people all over the world, especially those revolutionary people who are struggling for liberation, are studying Mao Zedong Thought with boundless enthusiasm, earnestly and with full confidence, and are using it as the most powerful weapon in their struggle, determined to follow the Chinese road, the Mao Zedong road, the Jiangangshan road, the road of people's war. This is the only road to liberation."

The editorial says: "The revolutionary people of Indonesia, the Indonesian proletariat, and their party—the Communist Party of Indonesia—have truly understood from the bloody lessons of the Indonesian people themselves what consequences will arise if revolutionary people and revolutionary parties deviate from Marxism-Leninism, deviate from the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought."

The editorial says: "The current facts show that armed struggles of the people have begun in various regions of Indonesia. Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Indonesia, which is guided by the correct political and military lines of Mao Zedong Thought, although the armed struggle of the people is still small at the beginning, it will definitely be able to persist and develop nationwide."

The editorial says: "Under the leadership of the Marxist-Leninist Communist Party of Indonesia, the Indonesian people will definitely be able to seize power first in the countryside and establish revolutionary bases. In the long-term revolutionary struggle—this is the armed struggle of the peasants under the leadership of the proletariat—this revolutionary base will grow from small to large. This road is the Mao Zedong road, the 'spark into a prairie fire' road, the road of relying on the peasants, establishing rural revolutionary bases, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and finally seizing the cities and achieving nationwide victory."

In introducing the important articles in the first volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*, the editorial says: "We can say without hesitation that Chairman Mao Zedong is the great Marxist-Leninist who has completely, comprehensively, systematically, and scientifically formulated the military theory of Marxism-Leninism—this is the most powerful weapon for the national liberation struggles of oppressed nations and peoples around the world. *On Practice* and *On Contradiction* are Mao Zedong's famous philosophical works, which are important developments and great contributions to the philosophy of dialectical and historical materialism, one of the three components of Marxism-Leninism."

The editorial concludes: "Indonesian revolutionaries welcome the publication of the first volume of *Selected Works of Mao Zedong* (Indonesian edition) with boundless joy and express their heartfelt thanks to the Chinese people, to the Communist Party of China, and to the beloved Chairman Mao. After experiencing bloody lessons, the Indonesian revolutionary people are determined to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought more earnestly. ... The road of the Indonesian liberation struggle inevitably must be the road of people's war pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong."

    认真学习运用毛泽东思想走人民战争道路
    《印尼人民之声》发表社论，欢呼《毛泽东选集》第一卷印尼文版出版，是中国人民和中国共产党给印尼人民和印尼共产党的非常有价值非常重要的国际主义贡献
    新华社十七日讯　印度尼西亚亚非人民团结组织刊物《印尼人民之声》最近发表社论，热烈欢呼《毛泽东选集》第一卷印尼文版出版。
    社论说：《毛泽东选集》第一卷印尼文版出版了。这部书的出版是中国人民和中国共产党给印尼人民和印尼无产阶级及其先锋队印尼共产党的非常有价值和非常重要的国际主义贡献。
    社论指出，《毛泽东选集》第一卷印尼文版的出版以及今年五月间《毛主席语录》印尼文版的出版，“都是无产阶级文化大革命在各方面取得的许多胜利中的一个胜利，也是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利！”
    社论说：“毛泽东主席亲自领导的、在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下的这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，使帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派关于在中国发生资本主义复辟的一切希望和美梦都破灭了。文化革命以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力荡涤着以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所设置的一切障碍，传播、宣传、学习和运用毛泽东思想的运动以空前未有的规模开展着。出版毛主席著作的工作在大跃进。全世界革命人民，特别是正在为争取解放而斗争的革命人民，满腔热情地、认真地和满怀信心地学习毛泽东思想并在斗争中作为最强大的武器加以运用，决心走中国的道路，毛泽东的道路，井冈山的道路，人民战争的道路，这是争取解放的唯一道路。”
    社论说：“印尼革命人民、印尼无产阶级及其政党——印尼共产党——从印尼人民自己的血的经验教训中真正体会到，要革命的人民和革命党，如果背离了马克思列宁主义，背离了当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想，会产生什么后果。”
    社论说：“目前的事实表明，印尼各地区已开始了人民武装斗争。在按照毛泽东思想的正确的政治路线和军事路线指导的马克思列宁主义的印尼共产党领导下，人民武装斗争虽然在开始时还小，但是，一定能够坚持和发展到全国去。”
    社论说：“印尼人民在马克思列宁主义的印尼共产党领导下，一定能够首先在农村夺取政权，建立革命根据地。在长期的革命斗争——这是在无产阶级领导下的农民武装斗争中，这个革命根据地将从小到大。这条道路是毛泽东道路，‘星星之火’的道路，依靠农民，建立农村革命根据地的道路，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市并取得全国胜利的道路。”
    社论在介绍《毛泽东选集》第一卷中的重要文章时说：“我们可以毫不犹豫地说，毛泽东主席是第一个完整地、全面地、系统地和科学地制订了马克思列宁主义的军事理论——这是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民争取民族解放斗争的最强大武器——的伟大的马克思列宁主义者。《实践论》和《矛盾论》是毛主席著名的哲学著作，是对马克思列宁主义三个组成部分之一的辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义哲学的重要发展和巨大贡献。”
    社论最后说：“印尼革命者怀着无限欢欣的心情热烈欢呼《毛泽东选集》第一卷（印尼文版）的出版，并向中国人民，向中国共产党和向敬爱的毛主席表示最由衷的感谢。印尼革命人民在经受了血的教训之后决心要更加认真学习和运用毛泽东思想。……印尼解放斗争的道路不可避免地必须是毛泽东同志所指出的人民战争的道路。”
