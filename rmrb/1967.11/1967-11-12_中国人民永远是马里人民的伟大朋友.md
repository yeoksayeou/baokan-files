Mali Newspaper Praises Chinese Expert Shiyangkang as a White-Style Warrior

The Chinese people are forever great friends of the Malian people.

Chinese experts nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought share both hardships and joys with the Malian people wherever they are.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Bamako, the Malian Sudanese Union Party's official newspaper, *Le Développement*, published a commentary on October 21st about the sacrifice of Chinese expert Shiyangkang in Mali, praising him as a White-style proletarian internationalist warrior. The Malian people are deeply saddened by the loss of such a comrade.

The commentary, recalling Shiyangkang's deeds before his martyrdom, pointed out that Chinese comrades in the Republic of Mali, under the guidance of the highly respected Mao Zedong Thought, correctly implemented Chairman Mao's teachings. No matter where they are, they share both hardships and joys with the Malian people, living among them without any sense of superiority. They are always the best examples in their work. Malian workers genuinely feel fortunate to be with their Chinese comrades.

The commentary said, "The seven hundred million brave and fearless socialist builders will forever stand on the side of the peoples of various countries who are engaged in national liberation struggles, and will forever oppose imperialism, old and new colonialism, and international reactionaries. They are consistent in defending the principles of proletarian internationalism."

The commentary praised the Chinese people for adhering to the policy of self-reliance, providing a good example for all revolutionaries and oppressed and exploited nations in the world who are determined to completely liberate themselves from imperialist rule. The commentary said, "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and its wise leader, the respected Chairman Mao Zedong, the Chinese people achieve extraordinary achievements every day in all aspects." The commentary praised the Chinese people for treating other oppressed peoples in the world without any sense of superiority and using their country's strong power to serve them.

The commentary emphasized that the Chinese people are forever great friends of the Malian people. The friendship between the Chinese and Malian peoples is deep, binding the two peoples closely together. The two peoples are better than anyone else at maintaining this sincere friendship and fighting unity based on true proletarian internationalism.
