Albania is making rapid progress on the path of industrialization. Currently, the industrial output value is more than forty times that of 1938.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tirana, the Albanian News Agency reported: Albania is rapidly developing towards becoming an industrial-agricultural country. Currently, the industrial output value is more than forty times that of 1938.

Now, factories, mining enterprises, hydroelectric power stations, and thermal power stations have been established all over Albania. In particular, in recent years, several new industrial sectors have been added nationwide. Currently, industrial output accounts for 40% of the national income, while in 1938 it was only 4%.

The Fourth Five-Year Plan approved by the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour emphasizes the rapid development of industry to ensure that by 1970, the total industrial output will increase by 50% to 54% compared to 1965. The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour closely links this development with the exploitation of natural resources, the mining of new ores and fuel deposits, and the domestic processing of these ores and fuels to increase their value. During the Fourth Five-Year Plan period, a total of fifty-seven important mining enterprises and factories will be constructed, and other factories will be built and completed in the next five-year plan.

According to a report by the New China News Agency in Tirana, the Albanian News Agency reported: Albania's copper smelting industry has formed a complete industrial sector from the refining of ores to the production of finished and by-products.

In the early days of liberation, there was only one small copper mine and one copper smelting plant producing rough copper in Rubik. Now, there are eleven mines belonging to the copper smelting industry. The planned output of rough copper during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will be 13% higher than the total output of the twenty years from 1946 to 1965.

During the Third Five-Year Plan period, the copper smelting industry developed rapidly. Although during this period, revisionism and imperialism imposed a savage blockade on Albania, this industry not only completed but also overfulfilled the planned development progress. The Kukes copper mine was discovered and put into production during this period. Albania's second copper smelting plant, which melts ores and produces rough copper, was designed and built entirely with its own national strength. At the same time, during the Third Five-Year Plan period, the industry for further processing rough copper was established. With the help of China's internationalism, two modern factories were established, one producing refined copper and the other producing copper wire. The completion of these two factories can meet the country's entire demand for copper products and increase the export of copper products.

    阿尔巴尼亚在工业化大道上迅猛前进
    目前工业产值相当于一九三八年的四十倍以上
    据新华社地拉那电  据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚正在过渡到工业—农业国的道路上快速地向前发展。目前工业产值相当于一九三八年的四十倍以上。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚各地都建立工厂、采矿企业、水电站和热电站等。特别是最近几年来，全国又新增加了一些新的工业部门。现在，工业产值占国民收入的百分之四十，而一九三八年只占百分之四。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会批准的第四个五年计划，特别重视工业的迅速发展，以便到一九七○年时，工业总产值能够比一九六五年增加百分之五十至百分之五十四。劳动党第五次代表大会把这一发展同开发天然资源、开采新矿和新的燃料矿藏以及在国内加工这些矿藏和燃料以增加它们的价值，紧密结合起来。在第四个五年计划期间，总共将另外建设五十七个重要的采矿企业和工厂，其他的工厂将在下一个五年计划期间兴建和建成。
    据新华社地拉那电  据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚炼铜工业已经形成了一个从提炼矿石直到生产成品和副产品的系统完整的工业部门。
    在解放初期，仅在鲁比克有一家提炼铜矿的小矿，一家生产粗铜的炼铜厂。现在，属于炼铜工业的矿厂已增加到十一家。第四个五年计划期间粗铜预定产量，将比一九四六年——一九六五年二十年间的总产量还要高百分之十三。
    在第三个五年计划期间，炼铜工业取得迅速的发展。虽然在这个时期，修正主义和帝国主义对阿尔巴尼亚进行了野蛮的封锁，这项工业不仅完成，而且超额完成了计划规定的发展进度。库克斯新铜矿就是在这个时期发现并投入生产的。阿尔巴尼亚第二座熔炼矿石和生产粗铜的工厂是完全依靠本国自己的力量设计和建成的。同时，在第三个五年计划期间开始建立进一步加工粗铜的工业部门。在中国的国际主义援助下建立了两座现代化工厂，一座生产精铜，一座生产铜线。由于这两座工厂的建成，就能满足国家对铜产品的全部需求，同时增加了铜产品出口。（附图片）
