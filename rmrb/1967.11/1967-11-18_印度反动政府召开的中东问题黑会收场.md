The reactionary Indian government, in close coordination with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, held a so-called "international conference" on the "peaceful resolution of the Middle East crisis" in New Delhi from November 11 to 14. Under the guise of "supporting the Arab people," this conference peddled the black goods of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, aiming to force Arab countries to surrender to U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

After the Glassboro talks, the U.S. government specially dispatched an envoy to New Delhi to brief the Indian government on their instructions. Subsequently, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, following the dictates of her American masters, rushed around, first to Yugoslavia to meet Tito, then to the Soviet Union to consult with Kosygin. Under the pretext of "peacefully resolving the Middle East issue," she coerced Arab countries to submit to U.S. imperialism and its tool, Israel.

According to reports from the Indian News Agency, India gathered representatives from the U.S., the Soviet Union, Italy, France, West Germany, and other countries to participate in this "international conference." To increase the deceptiveness of the conference, the Indian reactionaries had the Soviet revisionists' favorite in India, former Indian Defense Minister Menon, who consistently helps the U.S. imperialists in international settings, preside over the conference.

In his opening speech, Menon openly declared that the conference was convened to "seek a peaceful resolution to the tensions in the Middle East." The nature of this so-called "peaceful resolution to the tensions in the Middle East" was explained in a letter from Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to the conference. In her letter, Indira Gandhi first hypocritically expressed "condemnation" of Israel, then went on to discuss how "mutual respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence is the obligation of all United Nations member states," and how "resolving disputes and conflicts through force is wrong," and so on. This is an attempt to prevent the Arab people from retaliating against Israel's continuous war provocations with anti-aggression wars, and to force the Arab people to acknowledge the legitimacy of the permanent existence of Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism, in exchange for Israel's so-called withdrawal. Indira Gandhi is here peddling the same goods that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists pushed in their black market deals in Glassboro in June and in the United Nations in late October.

The conference was held in a cold and desolate atmosphere and concluded hastily on November 14.

    印度反动政府召开的中东问题黑会收场
    会议打着“支持阿拉伯人民”的幌子推销美苏反革命黑货
    据新华社十五日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府密切配合美帝苏修在联合国就中东问题进行的黑交易，在十一日到十四日在新德里出面召开了一个所谓“和平解决中东危机”的“国际会议”，打着“支持阿拉伯人民”的幌子，推销美帝苏修策划的迫使阿拉伯国家向美帝侵略工具以色列投降的黑货。
    在葛拉斯堡罗会谈后，美国政府曾专门派遣特使到新德里向印度政府进行传达布置。随后，印度总理英迪拉·甘地就根据美国主子的意旨，四处奔走，一会儿跑到南斯拉夫找铁托会谈，一会儿又跑到苏联找柯西金磋商，在“和平解决”中东问题的幌子下，诱压阿拉伯国家向美帝及其工具以色列屈服。
    据印度新闻处报道，印度纠集了美国、苏联、意大利、法国、西德等一些国家的所谓“代表”参加了这个“国际会议”。为了增加会议的欺骗性，印度反动派让苏修在印度的宠儿、在国际场合一贯对美帝小骂大帮忙的印度前国防部长梅农出面并主持这个会议。
    梅农在开幕词中公开叫嚷，这次会议是“为了寻求和平解决西亚紧张局势”而召开的。这个所谓“和平解决西亚紧张局势”是什么货色，印度总理英迪拉·甘地在给会议的一封信中作了注解。英迪拉·甘地在这封信中先是假惺惺地对以色列表示“谴责”，接着就大谈什么“彼此尊重主权、领土完整和政治独立是联合国所有会员国的义务”，“通过武力去解决分歧和纠纷是错误的”等等。这实际上是妄图迫使阿拉伯人民对不断进行战争挑衅的以色列不要用反侵略战争来给予回击，并且要阿拉伯人民承认美帝国主义一手扶植的侵略工具以色列永久存在的合法性，以此来换取以色列理所当然的撤军。英迪拉·甘地在这里所推销的正是美帝苏修六月间在葛拉斯堡罗会谈中以及十月下旬在联合国进行黑市交易中的货色。
    这个会议开得冷冷清清，十四日草草收场。
