Dear Comrade Ambassador Vasili Natanaeli,
Dear Comrade Shefqet Peçi,
Comrades and Friends,

Today is the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation. This is a glorious day for the Albanian people's liberation and a great day for the victory of Marxism-Leninism in Albania. The Chinese people, with hearts full of excitement, join the Albanian people in celebrating this day. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest congratulations to the great leader of the Albanian people and our close comrade-in-arms Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the glorious Albanian Party of Labour, to the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and to the fraternal Albanian people.

Twenty-three years ago, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, following the Marxist-Leninist teachings on armed seizure of power, fought a long and arduous war and defeated the Italian-German fascist invaders, liberating their country and embarking on the socialist path.

In the 23 years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party of Labour, the Albanian people have held high the banner of struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, defeated the armed provocations and subversive activities of imperialism and its lackeys, and resolutely defended the independence and territorial integrity of their homeland. The Albanian people have strongly supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and the anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people, demonstrating a high degree of proletarian internationalism.

Over the past 23 years, the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have held high the banner of struggle against modern revisionism, waged an uncompromising struggle against the modern revisionism centered on the Khrushchev renegade clique of the CPSU and the Tito renegade clique, as well as their agents in Albania. They have smashed the plots to subvert Albania, exposed the treacherous actions of betraying the interests of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world, and made great contributions to the defense of Marxism-Leninism.

Over the past 23 years, the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have adhered to the socialist path, continuously consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country in Europe into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture.

In recent years, under the leadership of their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have launched a magnificent revolutionary movement. Especially, the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Hoxha's important speech in February this year have pushed the Albanian revolutionary movement to a new high. This movement has greatly raised the political consciousness of the working masses, mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of millions of working people, and powerfully promoted the new developments in Albania's political, economic, military, cultural, and ideological fields, making Albania advance on the socialist path. Only a Marxist-Leninist party like the Albanian Party of Labour, which is closely connected with the masses, can have such courage and boldness to initiate and lead such a widespread revolutionary movement. The revolutionary movement shows that the Albanian Party of Labour, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively applies and develops Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of the country. This is of great significance in preventing revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania.

"Strong winds reveal the sturdy grass, and fierce fires test the true gold." The 23-year history of Albania since liberation proves that the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have withstood severe tests in the face of the encirclement of imperialism and its lackeys, the rampant European revisionist trends, and the stormy class struggles at home and abroad. Comrade Enver Hoxha has rightly said: "The Albanian people, with swords in hand, have blazed a trail in history." The Albanian people are heroic people standing tall and firm. The Albanian Party of Labour is a glorious Marxist-Leninist party. The beloved leader of the Albanian Party and people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a great Marxist-Leninist. Albania is a great socialist beacon, constantly radiating brilliant light and illuminating the path of liberation for the European peoples.

We, the Chinese people, sincerely and warmly congratulate the great achievements made by the fraternal Albanian people in all fields.

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. Chairman Mao has said: "The masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been so extensive and so deep." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, have been engulfed in the vast ocean of the people's revolutionary struggle, and the power they usurped has been reclaimed by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The great criticism is proceeding victoriously. The great unity is further developing. The three-in-one combination is gradually being established. The thought of Mao Zedong has been widely propagated and popularized, and the study and application of Mao Zedong thought have reached a high tide. Once Mao Zedong thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes a great material force, powerfully promoting the progress of production and all work. As our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any time in the past."

The task before us now is: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, to widely establish Mao Zedong thought study classes, to deeply carry out the "Criticize Revisionism and Repudiate Self" movement, to overcome the influences of various non-proletarian thoughts from the right and "left" sides, to further promote the great criticism, great unity, and three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, to grasp revolution and promote production and preparedness, and to do a better job in all aspects of work. At the same time, we must continue to maintain revolutionary vigilance, expose and foil the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrades and Friends,

The current international situation is excellent. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the process of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization of all political forces in the world. The international class lines are becoming clearer. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism in the world are continuously growing. The revolutionary consciousness of the peoples of all countries has reached an unprecedented height. The ugly faces and weak essence of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are increasingly exposed. Their difficulties are increasing, their contradictions are growing, and their days are getting harder. The heroic Vietnamese people are becoming stronger and stronger in their anti-American national salvation war, achieving one brilliant victory after another, and firmly grasping the initiative in the war. American imperialism has fallen into an unprecedented passive and extremely difficult situation. The victory of the Vietnamese people's war is pushing the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Southeast Asia, to wage armed struggles against American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism, unwilling to accept its defeat in Vietnam, is hurriedly colluding with Soviet modern revisionism, attempting to use the strategy of expanding the Vietnam War and promoting the plot of peace talks to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. Recently, the U.S. imperialist's indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam and the Washington military conference are new steps in Johnson's government's implementation of the counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. However, no matter what tricks the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists play, they will suffer disgraceful failures in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war until the U.S. aggressors are thoroughly defeated.

Imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the CPSU renegade clique, and the reactionaries of all countries, in order to resist the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, are further colluding to launch an anti-China backlash. Recently, the U.S. imperialists, on the one hand, have instigated the reactionaries of countries like Indonesia to step up their anti-China activities, and on the other hand, have directed the Japanese militarist leader Sato to run around, advocating the establishment of a so-called "Asia-Pacific Community" to cooperate with the Soviet revisionists in forming an anti-China encirclement. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin, along with a handful of labor traitors, after using the "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to launch a large-scale anti-China campaign, are now actively planning new black meetings. However, the more the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries act in such a retrograde manner, the more they will end up lifting stones to drop on their own feet. The reactionary backlash will never change the main trend of the excellent international situation.

The world belongs to the people. We believe that as long as we follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of opposing imperialism, unite all those who oppose imperialism and colonialism, firmly support the armed struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, firmly support the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys through to the end; hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the CPSU renegade clique through to the end, we will definitely be able to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

Comrades and Friends,

The friendship between China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is unbreakable. Recently, the party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu visited China again, making new and great contributions to further consolidating and developing our friendship. Comrade Shehu brought us the good news of the victory of the Albanian revolutionary movement and took back the determination of the Chinese people to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is a great encouragement to the peoples of both countries.

In the past year, the relations between our two parties and two countries in all fields have developed anew. Here, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Albanian comrades for their strong support for our party, our country, and our people.

In his message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared: "Please believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and two peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." The Chinese people will forever follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against imperialism, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against modern revisionism, and firmly support the Albanian people's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Whether imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are against Albania or against China, they must count China and Albania together.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania,

To the new great victories of the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction,

To the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought,

To the health of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and our close comrade-in-arms,

To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people,

To the health of Ambassador Vasili Natanaeli, Comrade Shefqet Peçi, and all the Albanian comrades present,

To the health of the diplomatic envoys and their spouses present from various countries,

To the health of all comrades and friends present,

Cheers!

    周恩来同志在庆祝阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年招待会上讲话
    阿尔巴尼亚是一盏伟大社会主义明灯
    照耀着欧洲人民争取解放的前进道路亲爱的瓦西里·纳塔奈利大使同志，亲爱的谢弗切特·佩奇同志，同志们，朋友们：
    今天是阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年。这是阿尔巴尼亚人民获得解放的光辉节日，也是马克思列宁主义在阿尔巴尼亚取得胜利的伟大节日。中国人民以无比兴奋的心情同阿尔巴尼亚人民一起，共同欢庆这个节日。我代表我们的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志，代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民，向阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民的亲密战友恩维尔·霍查同志，向光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，向阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，表示最热烈的祝贺。
    二十三年前，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，根据马克思列宁主义关于武装夺取政权的教导，经过长期艰苦的战争，打败意大利—德国法西斯侵略者，解放了自己的祖国，走上了社会主义的大道。
    解放后二十三年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在劳动党领导下，高举反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战斗旗帜，击败了帝国主义及其走狗的武装挑衅和颠覆活动，坚决地保卫了祖国的独立和领土完整。阿尔巴尼亚人民大力支持世界各国人民的革命斗争和越南人民的抗美救国战争，表现了高度的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    二十三年来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，高举反对现代修正主义的大旗，同以苏共赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义、铁托叛徒集团以及他们在阿尔巴尼亚的代理人进行了毫不妥协的斗争，粉碎了他们妄图颠覆阿尔巴尼亚的阴谋，有力地揭露了他们出卖国际无产阶级和世界人民的革命利益的叛徒行径，为捍卫马克思列宁主义作出了巨大的贡献。
    二十三年来，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持走社会主义的道路，不断巩固和加强无产阶级专政，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了辉煌的成就。阿尔巴尼亚已经从一个欧洲落后的农业国，变为拥有现代化工业、集体化农业的先进的社会主义国家。
    近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚人民在自己的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的领导下，掀起了一个气势磅礴的伟大的革命化运动。特别是阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和霍查同志今年二月的重要讲话，把阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动推向了一个新的高潮。这个运动大大地提高了劳动群众的政治觉悟，调动了千千万万劳动人民的革命积极性，有力地推动了阿尔巴尼亚在政治、经济、军事、文化、思想等各个领域里的新发展，使阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义大道上向前奔跑。只有象阿尔巴尼亚劳动党这样同群众血肉相连的马克思列宁主义的党，才能有这样的气魄和胆略，来发动和领导如此广泛的革命化运动。革命化运动表明，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党根据本国具体情况，创造性地运用和发展了马克思列宁主义。这对于在阿尔巴尼亚防止修正主义和防止资本主义复辟，具有极其重大的意义。
    “疾风知劲草，烈火见真金”。阿尔巴尼亚解放后二十三年的历史证明，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民，在帝国主义及其走狗的重重包围中，在欧洲修正主义思潮大泛滥中，在国内外阶级斗争的大风浪中，经受住了严峻的考验。恩维尔·霍查同志说得好：“阿尔巴尼亚人民手执宝剑开辟了历史的道路。”阿尔巴尼亚人民是顶天立地的英雄人民。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党是光荣的马克思列宁主义的党。阿尔巴尼亚党和人民敬爱的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志是伟大的马克思列宁主义者。阿尔巴尼亚是一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯，它不断发射出灿烂的光辉，照耀着欧洲人民争取解放的前进道路。
    我们中国人民对于兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在各个方面所取得的伟大成就，表示最衷心、最热烈的祝贺。
    一年多来，我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性的胜利。毛主席说过：“人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，已经陷入人民革命斗争的汪洋大海，被他们篡夺去的权力已为无产阶级革命派重新夺了回来。革命的大批判正在胜利展开。革命的大联合正在进一步发展。革命的三结合正在逐步建立。毛泽东思想得到了空前的大普及、大传播，活学活用毛泽东思想形成了高潮。毛泽东思想一旦为群众所掌握，就变成巨大的物质力量，有力地推动着生产和各项工作的前进。正如我们的伟大领袖毛主席所说的：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。”
    现在摆在我们面前的任务是：更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，广泛开办毛泽东思想学习班，深入展开“斗私批修”运动，克服来自右的和“左”的方面的各种非无产阶级思想的影响，进一步推动革命大批判、革命大联合和革命三结合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，抓革命，促生产，促战备，把各方面的工作做得更好，同时，要继续保持革命的警惕性，识破和揭穿阶级敌人的破坏活动，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    同志们，朋友们！
    当前国际形势一片大好。中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，加速了世界各种政治力量的大动荡、大分化、大改组的进程。国际阶级阵线越来越明朗化。全世界马克思列宁主义的队伍正在不断壮大。各国人民的革命觉悟空前提高。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的狰狞面目和虚弱本质日益暴露。他们的困难越来越多，矛盾越来越大，日子越来越不好过。英雄的越南人民在抗美救国战争中越战越强，取得了一个又一个的辉煌胜利，牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权。美帝国主义已经陷入空前被动和异常困难的境地。越南人民战争的胜利，正在推动全世界人民，特别是东南亚人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争。美帝国主义不甘心它在越南的失败，正在加紧勾结苏联现代修正主义，妄图用扩大越南战争和推行和谈阴谋的反革命两手策略，来扑灭越南人民的抗美救国战争。最近，美帝对越南北方的狂轰滥炸和华盛顿军事会议，就是约翰逊政府加紧推行反革命两手策略的新步骤。但是，不管美帝和苏修耍什么花招，他们在英雄的越南人民面前都将遭到可耻的失败。中国人民决心不惜做出最大的民族牺牲，全力支持越南人民的抗美救国战争，直到彻底打败美国侵略者。
    以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，为了抵制中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响，正在进一步勾结起来，掀起一股反华的逆流。最近，美帝国主义一方面策动印尼等各国反动派加紧反华，一方面指使日本军国主义的头子佐藤到处奔走，鼓吹建立所谓“亚洲太平洋共同体”，以便配合苏修，形成反华包围圈。苏共勃列日涅夫、柯西金修正主义叛徒集团及一小撮工贼们，在利用“纪念”十月革命五十周年大肆反华之后，又在积极策划新的黑会。但是帝、修、反如此倒行逆施，其结果只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。反动的逆流，终究改变不了国际形势大好的主流。
    世界是属于人民的。我们相信，只要按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，高举反对帝国主义的旗帜，团结一切反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的人们，坚决支持越南人民和亚、非、拉人民的武装斗争，坚决支持世界各国人民的革命运动，把反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底；高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，团结一切革命的马克思列宁主义者，把反对以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，我们一定能够建立起一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。
    同志们，朋友们，
    由毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志亲手缔造的中阿友谊是建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义基础上的，是牢不可破的。不久前，谢胡同志率领的党政代表团再次访华，为进一步巩固和发展我们的友谊作出了新的巨大贡献。谢胡同志给我们带来了阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动胜利的捷报，带回了中国人民把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的决心。这对于我们两国人民都是一个很大的鼓舞。
    在过去的一年里，我们两党、两国在各个方面的关系得到了新的发展。在这里，我们要衷心感谢阿尔巴尼亚同志对我党、我国和我国人民强有力的支持。
    毛泽东同志在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大的贺电中，庄严地宣称：“请同志们相信，不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”中国人民将永远遵照毛泽东同志的教导，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民反对帝国主义的斗争，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民反对现代修正主义的斗争，坚决支持阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，反阿也好，反华也好，都必须把中阿两国计算在一起。
    现在，我提议：
    为中阿两党、两国和两国人民的伟大友谊和战斗团结，
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得新的伟大的胜利，
    为战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖、中国人民亲密的战友恩维尔·霍查同志的健康，
    为中国人民伟大的领袖毛泽东同志的健康，
    为瓦西里·纳塔奈利大使同志、谢弗切特·佩奇同志和在座的全体阿尔巴尼亚同志的健康，
    为在座的各国使节和夫人们的健康，
    为在座的所有同志们和朋友们的健康，
    干杯！
