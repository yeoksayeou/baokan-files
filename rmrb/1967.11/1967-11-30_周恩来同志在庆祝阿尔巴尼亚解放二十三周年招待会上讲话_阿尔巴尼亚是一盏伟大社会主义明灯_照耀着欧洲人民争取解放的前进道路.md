Dear Comrade Ambassador Vasili Natanaeli,
Dear Comrade Shefqet Pe√ßi,
Comrades and Friends,

Today is the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation. This is a glorious day for the Albanian people's liberation and a great day for the victory of Marxism-Leninism in Albania. The Chinese people, with hearts full of excitement, join the Albanian people in celebrating this day. On behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, on behalf of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, I extend the warmest congratulations to the great leader of the Albanian people and our close comrade-in-arms Comrade Enver Hoxha, to the glorious Albanian Party of Labour, to the Government of the People's Republic of Albania, and to the fraternal Albanian people.

Twenty-three years ago, the heroic Albanian people, under the leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha and the Albanian Party of Labour, following the Marxist-Leninist teachings on armed seizure of power, fought a long and arduous war and defeated the Italian-German fascist invaders, liberating their country and embarking on the socialist path.

In the 23 years since liberation, under the leadership of the Party of Labour, the Albanian people have held high the banner of struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, defeated the armed provocations and subversive activities of imperialism and its lackeys, and resolutely defended the independence and territorial integrity of their homeland. The Albanian people have strongly supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world and the anti-American national salvation war of the Vietnamese people, demonstrating a high degree of proletarian internationalism.

Over the past 23 years, the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have held high the banner of struggle against modern revisionism, waged an uncompromising struggle against the modern revisionism centered on the Khrushchev renegade clique of the CPSU and the Tito renegade clique, as well as their agents in Albania. They have smashed the plots to subvert Albania, exposed the treacherous actions of betraying the interests of the international proletariat and the peoples of the world, and made great contributions to the defense of Marxism-Leninism.

Over the past 23 years, the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have adhered to the socialist path, continuously consolidated and strengthened the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieved brilliant successes in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Albania has transformed from a backward agricultural country in Europe into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture.

In recent years, under the leadership of their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have launched a magnificent revolutionary movement. Especially, the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour and Comrade Hoxha's important speech in February this year have pushed the Albanian revolutionary movement to a new high. This movement has greatly raised the political consciousness of the working masses, mobilized the revolutionary enthusiasm of millions of working people, and powerfully promoted the new developments in Albania's political, economic, military, cultural, and ideological fields, making Albania advance on the socialist path. Only a Marxist-Leninist party like the Albanian Party of Labour, which is closely connected with the masses, can have such courage and boldness to initiate and lead such a widespread revolutionary movement. The revolutionary movement shows that the Albanian Party of Labour, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, creatively applies and develops Marxism-Leninism according to the specific conditions of the country. This is of great significance in preventing revisionism and the restoration of capitalism in Albania.

"Strong winds reveal the sturdy grass, and fierce fires test the true gold." The 23-year history of Albania since liberation proves that the Albanian Party of Labour and the Albanian people have withstood severe tests in the face of the encirclement of imperialism and its lackeys, the rampant European revisionist trends, and the stormy class struggles at home and abroad. Comrade Enver Hoxha has rightly said: "The Albanian people, with swords in hand, have blazed a trail in history." The Albanian people are heroic people standing tall and firm. The Albanian Party of Labour is a glorious Marxist-Leninist party. The beloved leader of the Albanian Party and people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, is a great Marxist-Leninist. Albania is a great socialist beacon, constantly radiating brilliant light and illuminating the path of liberation for the European peoples.

We, the Chinese people, sincerely and warmly congratulate the great achievements made by the fraternal Albanian people in all fields.

Over the past year, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, has achieved decisive victories. Chairman Mao has said: "The masses have been fully mobilized. Never before has a mass movement been so extensive and so deep." The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, have been engulfed in the vast ocean of the people's revolutionary struggle, and the power they usurped has been reclaimed by the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The great criticism is proceeding victoriously. The great unity is further developing. The three-in-one combination is gradually being established. The thought of Mao Zedong has been widely propagated and popularized, and the study and application of Mao Zedong thought have reached a high tide. Once Mao Zedong thought is grasped by the masses, it becomes a great material force, powerfully promoting the progress of production and all work. As our great leader Chairman Mao has said: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than at any time in the past."

The task before us now is: to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong thought, to widely establish Mao Zedong thought study classes, to deeply carry out the "Criticize Revisionism and Repudiate Self" movement, to overcome the influences of various non-proletarian thoughts from the right and "left" sides, to further promote the great criticism, great unity, and three-in-one combination, to do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, to grasp revolution and promote production and preparedness, and to do a better job in all aspects of work. At the same time, we must continue to maintain revolutionary vigilance, expose and foil the sabotage activities of the class enemies, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Comrades and Friends,

The current international situation is excellent. The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has accelerated the process of great upheaval, great division, and great reorganization of all political forces in the world. The international class lines are becoming clearer. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism in the world are continuously growing. The revolutionary consciousness of the peoples of all countries has reached an unprecedented height. The ugly faces and weak essence of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are increasingly exposed. Their difficulties are increasing, their contradictions are growing, and their days are getting harder. The heroic Vietnamese people are becoming stronger and stronger in their anti-American national salvation war, achieving one brilliant victory after another, and firmly grasping the initiative in the war. American imperialism has fallen into an unprecedented passive and extremely difficult situation. The victory of the Vietnamese people's war is pushing the peoples of the world, especially the peoples of Southeast Asia, to wage armed struggles against American imperialism and its lackeys. American imperialism, unwilling to accept its defeat in Vietnam, is hurriedly colluding with Soviet modern revisionism, attempting to use the strategy of expanding the Vietnam War and promoting the plot of peace talks to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. Recently, the U.S. imperialist's indiscriminate bombing of North Vietnam and the Washington military conference are new steps in Johnson's government's implementation of the counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy. However, no matter what tricks the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists play, they will suffer disgraceful failures in the face of the heroic Vietnamese people. The Chinese people are determined to make the greatest national sacrifices and fully support the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war until the U.S. aggressors are thoroughly defeated.

Imperialism headed by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the CPSU renegade clique, and the reactionaries of all countries, in order to resist the great influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, are further colluding to launch an anti-China backlash. Recently, the U.S. imperialists, on the one hand, have instigated the reactionaries of countries like Indonesia to step up their anti-China activities, and on the other hand, have directed the Japanese militarist leader Sato to run around, advocating the establishment of a so-called "Asia-Pacific Community" to cooperate with the Soviet revisionists in forming an anti-China encirclement. The Soviet revisionist renegade clique of Brezhnev and Kosygin, along with a handful of labor traitors, after using the "commemoration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to launch a large-scale anti-China campaign, are now actively planning new black meetings. However, the more the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries act in such a retrograde manner, the more they will end up lifting stones to drop on their own feet. The reactionary backlash will never change the main trend of the excellent international situation.

The world belongs to the people. We believe that as long as we follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, hold high the banner of opposing imperialism, unite all those who oppose imperialism and colonialism, firmly support the armed struggles of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, firmly support the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, and carry the struggle against imperialism headed by the United States and its lackeys through to the end; hold high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, unite all revolutionary Marxist-Leninists, and carry the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the CPSU renegade clique through to the end, we will definitely be able to build a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without systems of exploitation.

Comrades and Friends,

The friendship between China and Albania, forged by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha, is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and is unbreakable. Recently, the party and government delegation led by Comrade Shehu visited China again, making new and great contributions to further consolidating and developing our friendship. Comrade Shehu brought us the good news of the victory of the Albanian revolutionary movement and took back the determination of the Chinese people to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. This is a great encouragement to the peoples of both countries.

In the past year, the relations between our two parties and two countries in all fields have developed anew. Here, we would like to express our heartfelt thanks to the Albanian comrades for their strong support for our party, our country, and our people.

In his message to the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly declared: "Please believe that no matter what happens in the world, our two parties and two peoples will definitely unite, fight, and win together." The Chinese people will forever follow the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against imperialism, firmly support the Albanian people's struggle against modern revisionism, and firmly support the Albanian people's socialist revolution and socialist construction. Whether imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries are against Albania or against China, they must count China and Albania together.

Now, I propose a toast:

To the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania,

To the new great victories of the Albanian people in the socialist revolution and socialist construction,

To the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong thought,

To the health of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the great leader of the Albanian people and our close comrade-in-arms,

To the health of Comrade Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people,

To the health of Ambassador Vasili Natanaeli, Comrade Shefqet Pe√ßi, and all the Albanian comrades present,

To the health of the diplomatic envoys and their spouses present from various countries,

To the health of all comrades and friends present,

Cheers!
