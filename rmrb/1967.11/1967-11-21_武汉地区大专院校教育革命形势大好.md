With Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon and "criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness" as the guideline, the educational revolution in higher education institutions in Wuhan is in a great situation. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff are putting "public" first, "breaking" first, and "daring" first, launching a high tide to thoroughly reform the old educational system and establish a proletarian educational system. In this high tide, most institutions have achieved revolutionary great unity and established revolutionary committees.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Wuhan on the 20th states: The latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on carrying out the proletarian educational revolution have greatly inspired the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in higher education institutions in Wuhan. With Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and "criticizing revisionism and fighting selfishness" as their guideline, they have quickly launched a high tide to thoroughly reform the old educational system, teaching principles, and teaching methods, and to vigorously create a proletarian educational system. In the high tide of the educational revolution, most institutions have achieved revolutionary great unity by class and established revolutionary committees.

The prominent feature of the great situation in the educational revolution in higher education institutions in Wuhan is that everyone is striving to be a proletarian revolutionary who is determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have repeatedly and seriously studied the latest instructions from our great leader Chairman Mao on carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. They have come to realize that whether the educational revolution is successful or not is a major issue concerning whether we are cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause or successors to the bourgeoisie, and it is a top priority concerning whether our socialist motherland will change color. To complete this great and glorious historical mission, we must thoroughly criticize selfishness and the bourgeois worldview, and thoroughly establish the spirit of public service, Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian worldview. They use the "Three Articles" as their weapon to sweep away all ideological obstacles on the path of the educational revolution. Institutions such as Huazhong Institute of Technology, Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Power, Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping, and Wuhan Institute of Mechanical Engineering have some teachers and staff who originally had some wrong ideas. Through studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Three Articles," they said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has entrusted us with the glorious task of the proletarian educational revolution, but we are afraid of this and that, and selfishness is at work. In this way, we cannot shoulder this glorious task." They expressed their determination to break with selfishness and become "proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end," and to do new things for the people.

Another notable feature of the great situation in the educational revolution in higher education institutions in Wuhan is that they are deeply engaged in revolutionary criticism and closely linking it with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own institutions. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. With destruction as the priority, construction is also included." Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, start by exposing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools, thoroughly exposing the cover of the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads within the schools, and fiercely criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and educational system advocated by Chinese Khrushchev and his agents on the educational front. They closely link the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform within their own institutions and majors. Many higher education institutions, through large meetings, small meetings, exhibitions, and visits, deeply expose, denounce, and criticize the revisionist educational line represented by Chinese Khrushchev. Many institutions also widely solicit the opinions of the working-class and peasant masses on the educational revolution and, together with them, criticize the old educational system, teaching principles, and teaching methods. The revolutionary teachers and students of the agricultural water conservancy major at Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Power, in conjunction with criticizing the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling this major, gave the first lesson of "resuming classes and making revolution," in which they told the students about the history of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in this major over the past seventeen years, which had a profound educational impact. Through exposure and criticism, some students who originally thought that resuming classes meant first resuming professional courses exclaimed, "If you don't expose, you don't know; if you expose, you are shocked." They realized that "the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our school can no longer continue," and actively participated in the revolutionary criticism. At present, the revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the old educational system by the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff is developing in depth.

The third feature of the great situation in the educational revolution in higher education institutions in Wuhan is daring to practice and boldly explore. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff follow Chairman Mao's teaching that "no matter who wants to understand something, they must come into contact with it, that is, live in (practice in) its environment, otherwise it is impossible to solve the problem." They insist on criticizing, practicing, teaching, and reforming at the same time, and have conducted a series of bold explorations on teaching organizations, teaching content, and teaching methods. Many institutions, such as Wuhan Institute of Water Transport Engineering, Huazhong Institute of Technology, Wuhan Post and Telecommunications Institute, and Wuhan Institute of Surveying and Mapping, have already begun to experiment according to the new teaching reform plans proposed by revolutionary teachers and staff. In practice, revolutionary teachers, students, and staff discuss, research, summarize, and improve together.

In the practice of the educational revolution, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in higher education institutions in Wuhan deeply feel that no matter what, Mao Zedong Thought must come first. With the deepening of the proletarian educational revolution, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff have launched a new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

    以毛泽东思想为武器，以斗私批修为纲
    武汉地区大专院校教育革命形势大好
    广大革命师生员工公字当头、破字当头、敢字当头，掀起一个彻底改革旧教育制度、大立无产阶级教育制度的高潮。在这个高潮中，大部分院校实现了革命大联合，成立了革命委员会
    新华社武汉二十日电  伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，极大地鼓舞了武汉地区大专院校广大革命师生员工。他们以毛泽东思想为武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，迅速掀起了一个彻底改革旧的教育制度、教学方针和教学方法，大力开创无产阶级教育制度的教育革命的高潮。在教育革命的高潮中，大部分院校实现了按班级的革命大联合，成立了革命委员会。
    公字当头，人人争当决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，这是武汉地区大专院校教育革命大好形势的突出特点。广大革命师生员工反复地认真地学习了我们伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，认识到教育革命搞得好坏，是关系到培养无产阶级革命事业接班人，还是培养资产阶级接班人的重大问题，是关系到我们社会主义祖国变不变颜色的头等大事。要完成这一伟大而光荣的历史使命，必须大破私字，大破资产阶级世界观，大立公字，大立毛泽东思想，大立无产阶级世界观。他们以“老三篇”为武器，横扫教育革命前进道路上的各种思想障碍。华中工学院、武汉水利电力学院、武汉测绘学院、武汉机械学院等单位，有些师生员工原来存在着一些错误思想，通过学习毛主席的最新指示和“老三篇”，他们说，伟大领袖毛主席把无产阶级教育革命的光荣重担交给了我们，我们却怕这怕那，私字作怪，这样就不可能担负起这个光荣的重担。他们表示坚决同私字决裂，做“决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”，为人民立新功。
    破字当头，深入开展革命大批判，把革命大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，这是武汉地区大专院校教育革命大好形势的又一显著特点。毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”广大革命师生员工以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，从揭发资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象入手，大揭学校里两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育战线上的代理人所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线和教育制度，把革命大批判同本院校本专业的斗批改紧密地结合起来。很多大专院校通过大会、小会、展览和访问等多种形式，深入揭发、控诉和批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线。不少院校还广泛征求工农群众对教育革命的意见，同他们一起批判旧的教育制度、教学方针和教学方法。武汉水利电力学院农田水利专业的革命师生，结合批判资产阶级知识分子统治这个专业的现象，复课闹革命的第一课，就向同学们讲述农田水利专业十七年来两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史，给大家教育很深。通过揭发、批判，一些原来认为复课首先就是要复业务课的同学，感慨地说：“不揭不知道，一揭吓一跳”。他们认识到：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”，积极投入了革命的大批判。目前，广大革命师生员工对反革命修正主义教育路线和旧的教育制度的大批判，正向纵深发展。
    敢字当头，勇于实践，大胆探索，这是武汉地区大专院校教育革命大好形势的第三个特点。广大革命师生员工遵照毛主席的“无论何人要认识什么事物，除了同那个事物接触，即生活于（实践于）那个事物的环境中，是没有法子解决的”教导，坚持一边批判，一边实践，一边教学，一边改革，对教学机构、教学内容和教学方法等进行了一系列大胆的探索。武汉水运工程学院、华中工学院、武汉邮电学院、武汉测绘学院等很多院校都已开始按照革命师生员工们提出的新的教改方案进行试验。在实践中，革命师生员工一起讨论，一起研究，不断总结，共同提高。
    武汉地区大专院校广大革命师生员工在教育革命的实践中，深深体会到，千当头，万当头，毛泽东思想首先要当头。随着无产阶级教育革命的深入开展，广大革命师生员工掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动新高潮。（附图片）
