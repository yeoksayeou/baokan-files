Wide groups of new and old revolutionary cadres have decided to take "criticizing oneself and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, to learn from each other, help each other, and improve relations with the masses.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 17th, revolutionary cadres, new and old, Red Guards, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army from all over the country have been studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions with great eagerness: "We must solve the problem of relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses well. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots level to have a look and to consult with the masses on everything. They should follow the mass line and learn to be the pupils of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent person, the person with the most ability, is the one with the most practical experience." They say that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a beacon lighting up our path forward. They say that implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions is of utmost importance. If one does not transform one's worldview, one cannot adhere to the mass line and cannot be a pupil of the masses. They unanimously declared that they will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take "criticizing oneself and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, grasp the transformation of one's worldview, and for life be close to the masses, be a pupil of the masses, and be a servant of the people.

Cadres, new and old, from various places have gained clearer insights into Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Li Botao, the chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Harbin Railway Bureau and the former bureau chief of the Harbin Railway Bureau, said: Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the most correct and brightest path forward for us. To resolutely and earnestly implement Chairman Mao's great instructions, we must take "criticizing oneself and repudiating revisionism" as the key link and thoroughly transform our worldview, filling our minds with the "Three Articles." Only in this way can we improve relations with the masses and improve relations between superiors and subordinates. After repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, Cheng Guopei, the former party branch secretary of the Wuhan Radio Components Factory, deeply felt: In the past, I put "self" first, treating the position of party branch secretary as an official post, standing high above the masses, seriously alienating myself from the masses. In this great proletarian cultural revolution, my officialdom was washed away, but I did not know how to do a good job and improve cadre-mass relations. Later, following Chairman Mao's teachings, I went among the masses, worked in shifts every day, rolled with the masses, and discussed with the masses. In this way, not only was the work done well, but the relations with the masses were also improved. These two aspects of experience and lessons have made me deeply realize that once a cadre deviates from Chairman Mao's teachings and from the masses, he will change color and go astray.

The unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution has tempered and tested a large number of revolutionary old cadres, pushing a batch of revolutionary new cadres to the forefront of the revolutionary leadership. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. While studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the editorial of the Wenhui Daily, "Support the Revolutionary New Cadres Warmly," revolutionary cadres, new and old, from various places expressed their unwavering confidence, saying that we will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing oneself and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, transform our worldview, trust and learn from each other, complement each other's strengths and weaknesses, and strengthen unity. At a study meeting, Wu Tao and Gao Jinming, vice chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said: Revolutionary new cadres are a new revolutionary shock force. We must learn from their strengths and warmly support and help them to become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Wang Zida, the head of the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee of Hangzhou City and the former mayor of Hangzhou City, said that revolutionary new cadres are full of vigor, have the least conservative thoughts, and accept new things the fastest, injecting new blood into the revolutionary cadre team. We must wholeheartedly support them, trust them, help them, and use our own experiences, especially the lessons from our mistakes, to educate them, so that they can quickly mature politically and together hold power well and use power well. Revolutionary new cadres from various places expressed that they will use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, criticize themselves and repudiate revisionism, break with selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and humbly learn from revolutionary old cadres, guard against arrogance and impatience, be vigilant against the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and always strictly demand of themselves according to Chairman Mao's five criteria for successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The new and old revolutionary cadres of the Beijing Railway Management Bureau Guang'anmen Station Revolutionary Committee seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest instructions. At the meeting, revolutionary new cadres expressed their willingness to accept the strengths of revolutionary old cadres as a precious treasure; revolutionary old cadres also expressed their willingness to learn from the new generation of revolutionaries. They also formed "red pairs" on the spot, determined to further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, help and learn from each other, promote each other, and together achieve new merits for the people.

The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have repeatedly studied the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, reviewed Chairman Mao's series of teachings on the relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses, and recalled the glorious tradition of unity between superiors and subordinates, between officers and soldiers, and between the army and the people in our army. They said that the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guide for us to improve relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses. Chairman Mao, who cares most about subordinates and the masses and most supports the revolutionary initiative of the masses, is our most brilliant and lofty example to learn from. Soldiers and officers fighting on the front lines of "three supports and two militaries" have been studying together with revolutionary masses and cadres in factories, schools, and offices, learning Chairman Mao's latest instructions and related works. The broad masses of soldiers and officers and revolutionary cadres jointly expressed that they will definitely implement Chairman Mao's instructions without wavering, take "criticizing oneself and repudiating revisionism" as the key link, and work hard on transforming their worldview and learning from the masses. They will follow Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, rely on the broad masses, humbly learn from the masses, consult with the masses on everything, forever be pupils of the masses, and forever be revolutionary soldiers loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

    把毛主席最新指示落实到行动中去  彻底改造世界观永做人民的勤务员
    广大新老革命干部决心以斗私批修为纲，互相学习，互相帮助，搞好同群众的关系
    据新华社十七日讯　全国各地无产阶级革命派、新老革命干部、红卫兵小将和人民解放军广大指战员，连日来如饥如渴地反复学习伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”他们说，毛主席的这一最新教导，是光芒四射的指路明灯，照亮了我们前进的航程。他们说，贯彻执行毛主席的这一最新指示，千重要，万重要，狠狠地改造自己的世界观最重要。如果不改造自己的世界观，就不可能坚持群众路线，就不可能做群众的小学生。他们一致表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以“斗私，批修”为纲，狠抓世界观的改造，一辈子和群众心连心，一辈子做群众的小学生，一辈子当人民的勤务员。
    各地广大新老革命干部，对毛主席的最新指示越学越心明眼亮。哈尔滨铁路局革命委员会主任委员、原哈尔滨铁路局局长黎波涛说：毛主席的最新指示给我们指明了最正确、最光明的前进方向。要最坚决、最认真地贯彻执行毛主席的伟大指示，就必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底改造自己的世界观，在自己的头脑里装上“老三篇”。只有这样，才能搞好同群众的关系，才能搞好上下级的关系。武汉无线电元件厂原党支部书记成国培反复学习了毛主席的最新指示以后，深有感受地说：以前自己“私”字当头，把支部书记的职务当官做，高高在上，严重地脱离了群众。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，自己的官气被冲掉了，但不知怎样做好工作，搞好干群关系。后来遵照毛主席的教导，到群众中去，每天跟班劳动，同群众滚在一起，同群众一起商量。这样，不仅搞好了工作，而且密切了同群众的关系。这两方面的经验教训，使我深深体会到，当干部的一脱离毛主席的教导，一脱离群众，就要变色，就要走到邪路上去。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命锻炼和考验了广大革命老干部，把一大批革命新干部推上革命领导岗位，这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。各地广大新老革命干部在学习毛主席的最新指示和《文汇报》社论《要热情地支持革命的新干部》时，信心百倍地表示，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，改造世界观，互相信任，互相学习，取长补短，加强团结。内蒙古自治区革命委员会副主任委员吴涛、高锦明等在学习座谈会上说：革命新干部是一支新生的革命突击队，我们一定要学习他们的长处，热情支持和帮助他们，使他们成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。杭州市革命委员会筹备小组组长、原杭州市市长王子达说，革命新干部朝气蓬勃，最少保守思想，接受新事物最快，给革命干部队伍增加了新鲜血液。我们一定要满腔热情地支持他们，信任他们，帮助他们，要用自己的经历，特别是犯错误的教训教育他们，使他们从政治上很快地成熟起来，共同掌好权，用好权。各地广大革命新干部表示，要以毛泽东思想为武器，斗私批修，破私立公，并虚心向革命老干部学习，戒骄戒躁，警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的进攻，时刻用毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个标准严格要求自己。北京铁路管理局广安门车站革命委员会的新老革命干部，认真学习讨论了毛主席的最新指示。会上，革命新干部表示要把革命老干部的长处，作为宝贵财富接受过来；革命的老干部也表示要向革命的新一代学习。他们还当场结成“一对红”，决心进一步活学活用毛主席著作，互相帮助，互相学习，互相促进，共同为人民立新功。
    人民解放军广大指战员反复学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，重温了毛主席关于上下级关系、干群关系的一系列教导，回顾了我军上下一致、官兵一致、军民一致的光荣传统。他们说，光焰无际的毛泽东思想是指导我们搞好上下级关系和干群关系的根本。毛主席最关心下级、最关心群众、最支持群众的革命首创精神，是我们最光辉最崇高的学习榜样。战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的广大指战员，连日来同工厂、学校、机关里的革命群众和革命干部一起，共同学习了毛主席的最新指示和有关著作。广大指战员和革命干部共同表示，一定要不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，在改造世界观上狠下功夫，在向群众学习问题上狠下功夫。做到上跟伟大领袖毛主席、毛泽东思想和以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，下靠广大群众，虚心向群众学习，遇事和群众商量，永远做群众的小学生，永远做忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想的革命战士。
