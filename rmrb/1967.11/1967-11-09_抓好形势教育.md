In the high tide of studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, many units of our army have focused on situation education, combining the unit's actual thoughts, extensively discussing the unprecedented great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, extensively discussing the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and extensively discussing the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, achieving very good results. This practice is worth noting and promoting.

Correct guidelines, policies, and deployments come from a correct analysis of the political situation and a correct assessment of class forces. Chairman Mao's series of latest instructions are based on the most scientific and profound analysis of the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. By focusing on situation education, we can help the broad masses further recognize the unprecedented great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, thereby more deeply understanding the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions and more consciously and effectively implementing Chairman Mao's great instructions. Conversely, if the assessment of the situation is incorrect, it will be impossible to correctly understand the guidelines, policies, and deployments formulated by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, leading to a series of erroneous practices, and even losing direction and going astray.

Under the great guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing extremely rapidly. Chairman Mao said: "What are the characteristics of the current movement? What are its laws? How to guide this movement? These are practical problems." "In the development of the movement, there are new things ahead, and new things are endless. Studying the overall situation and its development of this movement is a major topic that we must always pay attention to." We must frequently conduct situation education for the troops, so that the troops always maintain a clear mind and correct direction, closely following Chairman Mao, closely following Mao Zedong Thought, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. We must frequently analyze and summarize the new trends, achievements, experiences, and problems that arise in the movement using Mao Zedong Thought, and promptly educate the broad cadres and soldiers, so that their thoughts can keep up with the developing new situation.

The fundamental issue of situation education is to help the masses use Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and microscope to observe the complex class struggle situation, and to use Mao Zedong Thought to unify people's understanding of the situation, expose the class enemies' instigation and incitement, and overcome various non-proletarian ideological influences from the right or "left" side.

In his latest instructions, Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is great, not small. The overall situation is better than at any other time. The important sign of the great situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. No previous mass movement has been as widely and deeply mobilized as this one."

Using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation, we must, according to Chairman Mao's teaching, first focus on the masses. The masses are the creators and masters of history. The direction of the masses determines the essence of the revolutionary situation. The good or bad of our revolutionary situation depends on the breadth and depth of mobilizing the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and on the level of the masses' consciousness and organization. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that as long as Mao Zedong Thought is combined with hundreds of millions of people, except for traitors, spies, unrepentant capitalist-roaders within the Party, and the ghosts and monsters in society (i.e., those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who have not been reformed), everyone cares about national affairs and everyone rises up in revolution, then, no matter how arrogant the class enemies are for a time, no matter how cunning and deceitful they are, they cannot escape the fate of destruction; no matter what difficulties there are in advancing, they must be overcome. It was in the mobilization of tens of millions of revolutionary masses that the counter-revolutionary headquarters led by China's Khrushchev was destroyed.

When observing the situation, we must be good at distinguishing between the mainstream and the sidestreams, and not be misled by temporary and local surface phenomena. We should not exaggerate individual, temporary, and partial phenomena into universal, long-term, and overall issues. In this way, we can recognize the profound significance of the unprecedented great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, see the great revolutionary spirit and creative power of the people, see the vigorous new things that constantly emerge in the mass movement, and always be full of revolutionary optimism.

To focus on situation education and help the troops use Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation, we must follow the mass line. The struggle practice of tens of millions of revolutionary masses in the Cultural Revolution is a rich and varied teaching material. We must, through various forms, extensively absorb nutrition from society, and mobilize every comrade in the troops, using Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline, combining their personal experiences, analyzing the great situation of the Cultural Revolution, mutually inspiring and educating each other. In this way, we can make the situation education lively and vivid, effectively improve the troops' political consciousness, and help the troops better grasp Mao Zedong Thought and better advance along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao.

### 抓好形势教育

    抓好形势教育
    在学习毛主席最新指示的高潮中，我军许多单位抓紧形势教育，结合部队的思想实际，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，收到了很好的效果。这个做法值得重视，值得推广。
    正确的方针、政策、部署，来源于对政治形势的正确分析和对阶级势力的正确估量。毛主席的一系列最新指示，就是在对无产阶级文化大革命形势进行最科学、最精辟的分析的基础上提出的。抓好形势教育，让广大群众进一步认清当前无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，才能更深刻地领会毛主席最新指示的伟大意义，更自觉更得力地执行毛主席的伟大指示。相反，如果对形势的估计不正确，就不可能正确理解毛主席和党中央制定的方针、政策、部署，就会出现一系列的错误做法，甚至迷失方向，走到邪路上去。
    在伟大的毛泽东思想指引下，无产阶级文化大革命运动的形势，发展极其迅速。毛主席说：“当前的运动的特点是什么？它有什么规律性？如何指导这个运动？这些都是实际的问题。”“运动在发展中，又有新的东西在前头，新东西是层出不穷的。研究这个运动的全面及其发展，是我们要时刻注意的大课题。”我们必须经常向部队进行形势教育，使部队始终保持清醒的头脑和正确的方向，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。要经常把运动中出现的新动向、新成就、新经验、新问题，用毛泽东思想进行分析和总结，及时向广大指战员进行教育，使他们的思想能不断跟上发展着的新形势。
    形势教育的根本问题，就是要帮助群众用毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜，去观察错综复杂的阶级斗争形势，就是要用毛泽东思想统一人们对形势的认识，识破阶级敌人的挑拨煽动，克服来自右的或“左”的方面的各种非无产阶级思想影响。
  毛主席在最新指示中教导我们：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”
    用毛泽东思想观察分析形势，就要根据毛主席的这一教导，首先把着眼点放在群众身上。群众是历史的创造者，历史的主人。群众的动向，决定革命形势的本质。我们的革命形势的好坏，就看用毛泽东思想发动群众的广度和深度，就看群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，只要毛泽东思想同亿万人民群众相结合，除了叛徒、特务、顽固不化的党内走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神（即没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右）以外，人人关心国家大事，人人起来革命了，那么，无论阶级敌人怎样嚣张一时，怎样阴险、狡猾，都不能逃脱覆灭的命运；无论前进中有着什么样的困难，都一定能够克服。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命的资产阶级司令部，正是在亿万革命群众的发动中被摧毁的。
    在观察形势的时候，要善于区别主流和支流，不被一时一地的表面现象所迷惑。不要把个别的、暂时的、局部的某些现象，夸大为普遍的、长久的、全局性的问题。这样，我们就能够认识到无产阶级文化大革命种种史无前例的伟大胜利的深远意义，看到人民群众伟大的革命精神和创造力量，看到群众运动中不断涌现的朝气勃勃的新事物，永远充满革命的乐观主义。
    抓好形势教育，帮助部队用毛泽东思想观察形势，分析形势，必须走群众路线。亿万革命群众在文化大革命中的斗争实践，是丰富多采的活教材。我们一定要通过各种形式，广泛地从社会上吸收营养，并发动部队的每个同志，以毛泽东思想为指针，结合自己的切身感受，分析文化大革命的大好形势，互相启发，互相教育。这样，就能把形势教育搞得生动活泼，有效地提高部队的政治觉悟，使部队更好地掌握毛泽东思想，更好地沿着毛主席指引的方向前进。　　（十一月九日）
