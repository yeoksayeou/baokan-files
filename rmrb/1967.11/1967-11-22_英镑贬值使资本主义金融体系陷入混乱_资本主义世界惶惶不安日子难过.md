The British Labour government's decision to devalue the pound due to the deteriorating fiscal and economic situation has plunged the capitalist world's already fragile financial and monetary system into chaos. By the 21st, more than ten countries or regions had been forced to follow suit with their own currency devaluations. Stock markets in major capitalist countries experienced sharp declines. Financial leaders in Western countries admitted with unease that the devaluation of the pound not only fails to solve Britain's economic woes but will also bring a series of adverse effects to the entire Western world.

In the financial center of the capitalist world—New York—the foreign exchange market was paralyzed on the 20th due to the pound's devaluation.

Just as the U.S. international balance of payments was worsening due to the escalating Vietnam War, the devaluation of the pound, which is closely tied to the dollar, added immense pressure on the U.S. ruling class. Financial tycoons in Washington nervously stated that the pound's devaluation would make it even more difficult for the U.S. government to reduce its international balance of payments deficit and support the dollar's precarious position.

It was precisely out of this concern that, on the very night the British Labour government announced the pound's devaluation, the U.S. Federal Reserve, after an intense meeting, announced that starting from the 20th, the discount rate (the interest rate at which the Federal Reserve lends to commercial banks) would be raised from 4% to 4.5% to prevent the dollar from "uncontrolled outflow."

On the European continent, the pound's devaluation also sparked significant reactions. Within an hour of the devaluation announcement, Ireland and Denmark, both economically tied to Britain, announced their own currency devaluations. Spain, Cyprus, and Malta followed with similar decisions.

The pound's devaluation on the 20th also caused significant turmoil in European stock markets. Industrial stocks in Frankfurt, West Germany, experienced a sharp decline; capitalists also dumped government-issued bonds in large quantities. On the same day, in Paris, speculative traders frenziedly bought gold mining stocks, causing trading of these stocks to be temporarily suspended. Additionally, stock prices in Switzerland and Italy also saw significant declines.

The finance ministers of the six "Common Market" countries in Western Europe held an emergency meeting on the 19th to discuss the potential impact of Britain's actions on the six countries' exports. French Finance Minister Debré emphasized at a post-meeting press conference that the pound's devaluation and the subsequent measures taken would inevitably affect the six countries.

Due to the impact of the pound's devaluation, the Tokyo stock market experienced its second-largest decline in twenty years on the 20th, reflecting the Japanese financial sector's serious loss of confidence in the future.

    英镑贬值使资本主义金融体系陷入混乱
    资本主义世界惶惶不安日子难过
    据新华社二十一日讯  英国工党政府由于财政经济状况急剧恶化而采取的英镑贬值的措施，使得资本主义世界百孔千疮的金融和货币体系陷入混乱。到二十一日为止，先后有十多个国家或地区的货币被迫相继贬值。各主要资本主义国家的股票市场纷纷出现暴跌。西方国家金融界头目不安地承认，英镑贬值不但不能解决英国经济的痼疾，而且对整个西方世界将造成一系列的恶果。
    在资本主义世界的金融中心——纽约，外汇交易二十日因英镑贬值而陷于瘫痪状态。
    正当美国的国际收支状况由于侵越战争连连升级而不断恶化，逆差额连续第五季度上升的时候，同美元关系十分密切的英镑的贬值不能不使美国统治集团感受到特别沉重的压力。华盛顿的金融寡头不安地说，英镑贬值将使美国政府为减少国际收支逆差和支撑美元岌岌可危的地位而进行的努力遇到更大的困难。
    正是出于这种考虑，就在英国工党政府宣布英镑贬值的当天晚上，美国联邦储备委员会经过紧张会商之后，宣布自二十日起把贴现率（即联邦储备银行向各商业银行放款的利率）由百分之四提高到百分之四点五，以防止美元“无节制地外流”。
    在西欧大陆上，英镑贬值也引起了巨大的反响。在英镑贬值的消息宣布后不到一小时，在经济上同英国有着密切联系的爱尔兰和丹麦两国就相继宣布货币贬值。接着西班牙、塞浦路斯以及马尔他等也宣布了类似的决定。
    英镑贬值二十日还引起了西欧股票市场的大动荡。西德法兰克福的工业股票行情出现暴跌；资本家还大量抛售政府发行的债券。同一天，在巴黎，由于投机商疯狂抢购金矿股票，使这类股票的交易不得不暂停进行。另外，瑞士和意大利的股票行情也出现大幅度的下跌。
    西欧“共同市场”六国财政部长在十九日举行了非常会议，讨论英国这个行动对六国出口贸易可能产生的影响。法国财政部长德布雷在会后举行的记者招待会上强调，英镑贬值以及随之而采取的各种措施不可能不对六国产生影响。
    由于英镑贬值的影响，东京股票市场的行情在二十日发生了二十年来的第二次最大的暴跌，反映了日本金融界对前景严重丧失信心。
