	The Indian weekly "Remembrance of Patriots" published an article criticizing the Indian Communist Party's revisionist line of "peaceful transition," accusing them of wearing the cloak of Marxism-Leninism while protecting the reactionary rule of the Indian exploiting classes.

	The article states that the Political Bureau of the Indian Communist Party distributed a document among its members, describing its political line as follows: "The Indian Communist Party strives to achieve the goal of establishing a people's democracy and transitioning to socialism through peaceful means. However, since the ruling class sets obstacles on this path and suppresses the people with terror and violence, the party must remain vigilant and avoid such unexpected incidents through all possible means. The party should use both parliamentary and non-parliamentary forms of struggle and achieve the transition to socialism through peaceful means."

	The article points out that after reading the words of the Indian Communist Party's Political Bureau, their revisionism and love for the Indian ruling class can no longer be hidden. We must ask: what is this non-parliamentary path they claim to use to achieve their goals? In fact, have they ever done anything other than struggle for a few seats in the federal and state legislatures to establish their personal leadership?

	So far, they have not taken a single revolutionary action in the true sense of Marxism-Leninism, nor have they taken any action to weaken the exploiters and strengthen the working class. They have never engaged in genuine revolutionary struggles to defeat and eliminate the enemy. On the contrary, they have adopted Gandhi's strategies and methods of struggle. Whenever workers, peasants, and the lowest strata of the masses rise up against the government, instead of providing revolutionary guidance, they limit the struggle to forms such as demonstrations, strikes, shutdowns, hunger strikes, sit-ins, and encirclements. In this way, they corrupt and destroy the fighting spirit of the masses, thereby ensuring that the interests of the capitalists and landlords in this country are not harmed in any way.

	Therefore, the purpose of all their talk about non-parliamentary forms of struggle is to help the ruling class of this country maintain its power and weaken the strength of the exploited classes. Today, they form a united front with the most reactionary elements in various states of India, sharing power with them. Does this not mean that they want the working people to abandon class struggle and be exploited by the capitalists, landlords, princes, and rulers at home and abroad?

	The article emphasizes that to refuse to distinguish classes and evade class struggle is to undermine the fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. This is revisionism, pure revisionism, unadulterated revisionism. In European countries, the deeply rooted parliamentary system has not brought socialism. Can we expect such a system to bring socialism to India?

	The article concludes by saying that from these circumstances, it is clear that those within the Indian Communist Party who propose the deceptive slogan of "peaceful transition" are actually implementing policies to castrate and destroy the revolutionary movement of India's impoverished and suffering people. They wear the cloak of Marxism-Leninism but in reality sing hymns of non-violence, leading the people away from the revolutionary path of Marxism-Leninism. They are protecting the interests of Indian capitalists from the impact of the surging revolutionary tide of the Indian people in this way. Their role is no different from that of Gandhi, who acted as a safety valve for the British imperialists in India.

### 印《回忆爱国者》周刊痛斥印修推行“和平过渡”修正主义路线  印修分子是反动势力的维护者

    印《回忆爱国者》周刊痛斥印修推行“和平过渡”修正主义路线
    印修分子是反动势力的维护者
    新华社讯　新德里消息：印度进步周刊《回忆爱国者》刊登文章，批判印共修正主义分子披着马克思列宁主义的外衣，推行“和平过渡”路线，取消和破坏印度人民的革命，保护印度剥削阶级的反动统治。
    文章说，印共政治局在党员中散发的一个文件，用下列的话来描述它的政治路线：“印度共产党努力通过和平方式来达到建立人民民主和实现向社会主义过渡的目标。但是因为统治阶级在这条道路上设置了障碍，用恐怖和暴力镇压人民，所以党应该保持警惕，并用一切办法避免这样的意外事件。党应该使用议会斗争形式和非议会斗争形式，并通过和平方式实现向社会主义过渡。”
    文章指出，看了印度共产党政治局的这番话，它的修正主义和对于印度统治阶级的爱护再也不能隐藏了。我们要问：他们自称用以达到他们的目标的这个非议会道路是什么呢？事实上，他们历来除了在这里和那里争取几个联邦议会和邦议会的席位，建立他们个人的领导权之外还想过别的事情吗？
    他们迄今为止没有采取过一次按真正的马克思列宁主义的观念而言可以称为革命行动和旨在削弱剥削者而加强工人阶级的行动。他们从未投身于真正的革命斗争，来打败和消灭敌人。另一方面，他们采取了甘地的斗争策略和方法。每当工人、农民、最下层的群众反政府的斗争和运动起来的时候，他们非但不给以革命的指导，反而将其限制在诸如示威游行、罢工、罢市、绝食、静坐、围困等斗争形式上，这样就腐蚀和破坏了他们的战斗精神，因而也就确保了这个国家的资本家地主的利益不受任何损害。
    因此，他们关于非议会斗争形式的一切谈论的目的，是要帮助这个国家的统治阶级维持政权，削弱被剥削阶级的力量。今天他们在印度的各个邦同极端反动的分子结成统一战线，同他们分享权力，这难道不意味着他们要劳动人民放弃阶级斗争，而受资本家、地主、王公等国内外统治者的剥削吗？
    文章强调说，拒绝区分阶级，逃避阶级斗争，等于是破坏马克思列宁主义的根本原则。这是修正主义，纯粹的修正主义、清一色的修正主义。在欧洲国家里，历史上根深蒂固的议会制度未能给那里带来社会主义。那么我们能指望这样一种制度会给印度带来社会主义吗？
    文章最后说，从这些情况可以十分清楚地看出，印度共产党内那些提出“和平过渡”这个欺骗性口号的人，实际上执行着阉割和破坏印度贫穷困苦的人民的革命运动的政策。他们披着马克思列宁主义者的外衣，实际上唱着崇拜非暴力的赞歌，引导人民脱离马克思列宁主义的革命道路。他们正是用这种方式保护印度资本家的利益不受印度人民日益高涨的革命洪流的冲击。他们的作用同甘地所起的充当在印度的英帝国主义者的安全阀门的作用没有什么不同。
