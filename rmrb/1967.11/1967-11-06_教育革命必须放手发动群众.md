The educational revolution must depend on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers within the school. It must rely on the activists among them, that is, the revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Chairman Mao's latest directive is like a beacon, illuminating the hearts of teachers and students who are currently attending classes and making revolution. The entire campus of Beijing Agricultural University is boiling with excitement!

Starting from the evening of the second, revolutionary teachers, students, and staff from all over the school held various types of linkage meetings, symposiums, and discussion sessions to seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's latest directive. Countless revolutionary big-character posters filled the campus, and one after another, preliminary plans for the agricultural educational revolution were put forward. A magnificent wave of proletarian educational revolution is surging in our school. Revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers from all over the school are rushing to the battlefield of educational revolution from all directions. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, breaking through all the nets that bind them, and rushing forward on the road of proletarian educational revolution. Chairman Mao's latest directive has fully mobilized the enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff throughout the school!

In the previous period of attending classes and making revolution, we deeply felt that: in the early stage of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road requires a thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat; today, when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, overthrowing the revisionist educational system and establishing a proletarian educational system also requires a thorough revolutionary spirit of the proletariat. In the past, we needed to mobilize the masses wholeheartedly, rely on the masses resolutely, and respect the spirit of initiative among the masses; today, we must do the same. In the past, we overthrew the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road by relying on Mao Zedong Thought; today, in carrying out the educational revolution, we must not for a moment deviate from Mao Zedong Thought.

"The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." In the previous period, due to our insufficient belief in the masses, insufficient mobilization of the masses, and insufficient reliance on the masses, some classes appeared with business interfering with politics and textbooks being patched up. Once again, it is our great leader Mao Zedong who, at this crucial moment, points out the direction for us. We will follow the course opened by Chairman Mao, navigate past one reef after another, and sail towards the goal of the May 7th Directive!

At this moment, our hearts are filled with such excitement! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We are determined to follow your teachings, firmly adhere to the principle of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself" on the great road of attending classes and making revolution, mobilize the masses wholeheartedly, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the revisionist educational system, and establish a proletarian educational system. We will turn Beijing Agricultural University into a school in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University.

    教育革命必须放手发动群众
    北京农业大学革命委员会
    “进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席这一最新指示，象指路明灯，照亮了正在进行复课闹革命的师生员工的心，整个农大校园立刻沸腾起来了！
    从二日晚上开始，全校革命师生员工纷纷举行各式各样的串连会、座谈会、讨论会，认真学习和深刻领会毛主席的这一最新指示。无数张革命的大字报贴满了校园，一个接着一个的农业教育革命的初步方案提了出来。一个波澜壮阔的无产阶级教育革命的高潮正在我校兴起。全校的革命学生、革命教员、革命工人正从各个方面冲向教育革命的战场。他们高举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，在无产阶级教育革命的路上迅跑。毛主席的最新指示，把全校革命的师生员工的积极性充分调动起来了！
    在前一段复课闹革命的实践中，我们深深地体会到：无产阶级文化大革命运动初期，造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，需要无产阶级的彻底革命精神；在无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了决定性胜利的今天，破修正主义教育制度，立无产阶级教育制度，同样需要无产阶级的彻底革命精神。过去，要放手发动群众，坚决地依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神；今天也必须如此。过去，我们造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，靠的是毛泽东思想；今天搞教育革命，更是一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想。
      “群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。”前一段，由于我们相信群众不够充分，发动群众不够放手，依靠群众不够坚决，个别班级出现了业务冲击政治，教材修修补补的现象。又是我们伟大的领袖毛主席，在这个重要时刻，再一次给我们指明了航向。我们将沿着毛主席开辟的航道，绕过一道道暗礁，朝着“五·七”指示的目标，扬帆前进！
    此刻，我们的心情是何等的激动啊！毛主席啊，毛主席！我们决心遵照您老人家的教导，在复课闹革命的大道上坚定不移地以
  “斗私，批修”为纲，放手发动群众，大破大立，边破边立，彻底批判修正主义的教育制度，大立无产阶级的教育制度，把农大办成“抗大”式的学校。
