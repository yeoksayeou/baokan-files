	"Agriculture Must Also Retreat Enough" Is a Call for Counterrevolution
	Jiangsu Hai'an County Activist in Studying Chairman Mao's Works

	A bitter taste of gall, recalling the hatred of ten thousand households,
	Remembering class bitterness, strengthening the resolve to criticize revisionism.

	The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, was a serious struggle of thought and politics." Indeed, the overthrown reactionary ruling class, with their evil hearts unchanged, like foxes dreaming of counting chickens, never forget their lost "paradise." At every opportunity, they launch a counterattack and try to restore their power. They sabotage agricultural cooperativization, oppose people's communes, and attempt to restore capitalism in the countryside.

	Since liberation, for more than a decade, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has been wearing the disguise of an "old revolutionary," paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in the countryside. During the period of temporary difficulties in our national economy, China's Khrushchev, driven by his reactionary nature, eagerly jumped out and shouted, "Agriculture must also retreat enough, including contracting production to households and individual farming," "Don't be afraid of the spread of capitalism," and so on. This is a blatant order to the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements nationwide to stage a counterrevolution. The four types of class enemies in our village also took this opportunity to stir up trouble and create chaos. They flipped through their counterrevolutionary accounts, recited their restoration scripts, inspected houses, checked boundaries, eyed furniture, and plotted to seize power. One of the four types of class enemies walked around the land he used to occupy and arrogantly told the old poor peasant who had been given his house and rice bin to fix the house and polish the rice bin, waiting for him to take them back. This scoundrel threatened, "You have your plan to lock the door, and I have my way to jump over the wall. Now it's my turn to come out!" During the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards discovered that this bad element had hidden his counterrevolutionary accounts for more than twenty years, including a large amount of silver and bundles of "central banknotes" and "reserve tickets."

	The essence of "Agriculture must also retreat enough" is to restore capitalism in the countryside and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. As the saying goes, "To strike a snake, strike at its head; to uproot a tree, uproot its roots." We must seize this essence and fiercely criticize the landlords, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and bad elements' representative and backer—China's Khrushchev. He wants to "change our minds first and then change our heaven." We will risk our lives to fight him, thoroughly criticize and expose his reactionary thoughts and revisionist fallacies, and throw them into the manure pit to fertilize the fields!

    “农业上也要退够”是变天号令
    江苏海安县学习毛主席著作积极分子  角斜红旗民兵团红卫大队民兵营副教导员  曹连凤
    一串黄连泪，忆起万家仇，牢记阶级苦，批修添劲头。
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”事实正是这样，被推翻的反动统治阶级，他们贼心不改，象“狐狸做梦也数鸡”一样，念念不忘他们已经失去的“天堂”。一有机会就实行反攻倒算。他们破坏农业合作化，反对人民公社，妄图在农村复辟资本主义。
    解放后十几年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，一直披着“老革命”的外衣，为农村资本主义复辟鸣锣开道。在我国国民经济暂时困难的时期，中国赫鲁晓夫出于他的反动本性，迫不及待地跳出来，大喊大叫说：“农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干”，“不要怕资本主义泛滥”等等。这是明目张胆地给全国地富反坏分子下的一道变天号令。我们村的四类分子也就在这个时候大掀黑浪逆流，四处蠢动。他们翻变天账，念复辟经，看房屋，查地边，瞅家具，想变天。有一个四类分子，跑到他从前霸占的土地周围绕了一圈，还嚣张地告诉分了他的房子和米柜的老贫农，把房子修好，把米柜漆亮，等他来取。这个家伙威胁说：“你有你的关门计，我有我的跳墙法。现在轮到我出头的时候了！”在文化大革命中，红卫兵查出了这个坏家伙隐藏了二十多年的变天账，大量的白银和成捆的“中央币”、“储备票”。
    “农业上也要退够”的要害，就是要在农村复辟资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。俗话说：打蛇要打在七寸上，挖树要挖在树根上。我们要抓住这个要害，狠批地、富、反、坏分子的总代表、总后台——中国赫鲁晓夫。他妄想“先变我们的心，后变我们的天”。我们就豁着性命跟他拚，把他的反动思想，修正主义谬论，统统批倒、批臭，扔进茅缸沤粪垩田！
