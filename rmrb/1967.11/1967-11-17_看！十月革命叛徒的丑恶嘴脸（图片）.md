Look, in the lair of U.S. imperialism, Washington, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Dobrynin (front right), took the opportunity of the "celebration" of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to hold a reception where he and the U.S. imperialist leader, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk (left), became thick as thieves, drinking vodka and talking about "peaceful coexistence." The Soviet revisionist embassy staff were flattered, exclaiming, "Tonight, having the U.S. Secretary of State with us is so wonderful!"

The cannibalistic devils and the traitors of the October Revolution are together, reveling and enjoying themselves. This is the best portrayal of the Soviet modern revisionists' embrace of U.S. imperialism, and it is also the ironclad evidence of the counter-revolutionary collusion between the Soviet Union and the United States.

    看！十月革命叛徒的丑恶嘴脸
    看，在美帝国主义的老窝华盛顿，苏联驻美国大使多勃雷宁（前右）借用“庆祝”十月革命五十周年之机，在招待会上与美帝国主义头目、美国国务卿腊斯克（左）打得火热，狂饮伏特加酒，大谈“和平共处”。苏修驻美使馆人员竟受宠若惊，狂呼：“今晚有（美国）国务卿同我们在一起，是多么美好呀！”
    吃人的魔鬼同十月革命的叛徒在一起行欢作乐，这就是苏联现代修正主义投入美帝国主义怀抱的最好写照，也是苏美进行反革命勾结的铁的罪证。　新华社发（传真照片）
