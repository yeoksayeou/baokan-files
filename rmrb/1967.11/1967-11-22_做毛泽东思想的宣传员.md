In a small town in West Bengal, India, a young man not only strives to study Mao Zedong Thought but also actively propagates it to others. How he yearns for a copy of the precious book "Quotations from Chairman Mao"! But unable to obtain one for the time being, he collects the quotations of Chairman Mao published in the bulletins of the Chinese Embassy, studies them one by one. He also translates these quotations from English into Bengali in his spare time. He even sets aside money from his meager wages to buy paper and ink, copies and prints them, and distributes them to the people around him for study. He has already formed a study group on Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with his comrades.

This spring, he managed to collect more than eighty pictures related to the Chinese people's aid to Vietnam's resistance against U.S. aggression and opposition to modern revisionism. Overcoming numerous difficulties, he held an exhibition in his locality. Since he had no money to rent a room, he displayed the pictures in the open square. Before the exhibition, he put up a large poster on the street: "First Exhibition in India - Exhibition of the Chinese People's Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Revisionist Struggle." He also wrote two quotations from Chairman Mao in Bengali in front of the exhibition. One reads: "To disturb, to fail, to disturb again, to fail again, until they are thoroughly defeated - that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when they deal with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The other reads: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions among the people."

The exhibition caused a sensation throughout the small town. Besides looking at the pictures, the audience also carefully read the quotations from Chairman Mao. After the exhibition, the young man sent the pictures to his friends in other places so that they could be exhibited there to educate more people.

    做毛泽东思想的宣传员
    印度西孟加拉邦某地小镇上的一位青年，不仅自己努力学习毛泽东思想，而且还积极地向别人宣传。他多么想有一本宝书《毛主席语录》呀！但一时未能得到，他就把中国大使馆公报上登载的毛主席语录一条一条地搜集起来学习。他又利用业余时间把这些语录从英文翻译成孟加拉文。他还从自己微薄的工资里抽出钱来买纸和油墨，誊刻油印，送给周围群众，供他们学习。他已经和同伴们组成了一个马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想学习小组。
    今年春天，他设法搜集了八十多张有关中国人民援越抗美和反对现代修正主义的图片，克服种种困难，在当地举办了一个展览会。因为没有钱租房子，就在广场展出。展出前夕，他在街头贴出了巨幅广告“印度首次展出——中国人民反帝反修展览会”。他还在展览会前面用孟加拉文写了两条毛主席语录。一条是：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”另一条是：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    展览会把整个小镇都轰动了。观众除了看图片外，还认真地读毛主席语录。展览会结束后，这位青年把图片寄给了外地朋友，以便在别处展出，教育更多群众。
