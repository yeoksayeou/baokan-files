Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new and higher stage. Lin Biao

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism

New China News Agency reports: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, *The Vanguard*, recently published two consecutive articles emphasizing the importance of combining theory with practice. It also pointed out that only through revolutionary practice can one truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought.

The article on October 19 states: Mao Zedong Thought is the highest development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. People can only truly grasp Mao Zedong Thought by studying Mao Zedong's works in the process of revolutionary practice. The two are inseparable.

The article states: Participating in class struggle practice, if one does not constantly seek guidance from Mao Zedong Thought, this practice will lose its revolutionary content and degenerate into reformist, vulgar practice. Similarly, if one does not study with the problems arising from the struggle in revolutionary practice, then studying will fall into the dead end of dogmatism.

The article points out: Only in the process of mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this indispensable weapon, can one make one's understanding conform to objective reality. If someone participates in the masses' struggle but does not often study Chairman Mao's works, he will completely lose his way. The article believes that Chairman Mao's *On Practice* brilliantly points out the method for Australian revolutionaries to grasp the actual situation in Australia.

The article published in *The Vanguard* on October 26 emphasizes that all revolutionaries must deepen their understanding of Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle. The article states: To deepen understanding, one must deeply participate in the masses' struggle. There is no abstract learning; learning for the sake of learning. There is only learning combined with practice; learning for the sake of practice. Only through practice, through actual participation in mass work, can one learn something. The article believes that in this regard, Chairman Mao has provided the best guidance.

    毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。  林彪
    澳共（马列）《先锋报》强调在斗争中加深对毛泽东思想的领会
    毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的最高发展
    新华社讯　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》最近两期连续发表文章强调理论联系实际的重要性，并且指出只有在革命实践过程中才能掌握毛泽东思想。
    十月十九日的文章说，毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高发展。人们只有在革命实践的过程中学习毛泽东著作，才能真正掌握毛泽东思想。二者是不可分割地联系在一起的。
    文章说，参加阶级斗争实践，如果不是不断地求教于毛泽东思想的指导，这种实践就会失去革命的内容，就会沦为改良主义的庸俗的实践。同样，如果不带着在革命实践的斗争中产生的问题去进行学习，那末学习就会陷入教条主义的死胡同。
    文章指出，只有在掌握毛泽东思想这一不可缺少的武器的过程中，才能使认识符合客观现实。如果谁参加群众斗争，而不常常学习毛主席的著作，他就会完全迷失方向。文章认为，毛主席的《实践论》光辉地指出了使澳大利亚革命者掌握澳大利亚实际情况的方法。
    《先锋报》十月二十六日发表的文章，强调一切革命者必须在斗争中进一步加深对毛泽东思想的领会。文章说，要加深领会，就要深入参加群众斗争。不可能有抽象的学习，为学习而学习。只能有联系实际的学习，为实践而学习。只有通过实践，通过实际参加群众工作，才能学到东西。文章认为，在这方面毛主席给予了最好的指导。
