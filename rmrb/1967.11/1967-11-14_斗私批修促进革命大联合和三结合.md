The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xi Gu Thermal Power Plant in Lanzhou have actively assisted the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the plant in holding Mao Zedong Thought study classes to struggle against self and criticize revisionism. This has effectively promoted the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination in the plant. Six out of the eight sub-plants in the factory have now established revolutionary committees.

The students of the Mao Zedong Thought study class in Xi Gu Thermal Power Plant include revolutionary cadres from the plant, sub-plants, departments, and sections, as well as key members from various revolutionary mass organizations. Some of these individuals have been influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line, leading to significant mutual animosity. Others, due to differing viewpoints, could not even sit together. The stationed soldiers and the students of the study class have jointly studied Chairman Mao's works and earnestly helped the students to learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They have placed the struggle against self and the criticism of revisionism as the guiding principle, prioritizing the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works above all else. They have armed the proletarian revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking and fostering a great alliance in thought.

On the first day of the class, the driver Liu Rongchang from the motor vehicle team and the security officer Zhang Jianying had an argument. The soldiers patiently conducted ideological and political work with both parties, using Chairman Mao's teachings to help them distinguish right from wrong and struggle against the "self" in their minds. The next day, during the study meeting, both parties made self-criticisms and achieved unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, promoting a great alliance in thought.

The revolutionary cadres and workers of the plant, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, have also improved their understanding of cadres. They said, "We must firmly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy. We should not only look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but also at the cadre's entire history and work. We should expand the scope of education. We should not dwell on the mistakes of cadres but allow them to correct their mistakes and help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The Mao Zedong Thought study class in Xi Gu Thermal Power Plant has adopted a method that combines classroom and extracurricular learning, as well as the study class with the factory's mass "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" activities.

Under the great call of "struggle against self and criticize revisionism" by Chairman Mao, a new high tide of achieving revolutionary great alliance by system and establishing revolutionary three-in-one combination temporary power organs—revolutionary committees—from the bottom up is forming in Xi Gu Thermal Power Plant. The slogan "grasp revolution, promote production" is also showing a new and vibrant scene.

    解放军帮助西固热电厂举办毛泽东思想学习班
    斗私批修促进革命大联合和三结合
    全厂出现按系统实现革命大联合的局面，八个分场中的六个分场已成立革委会
    据新华社兰州电人民解放军驻兰州市西固热电厂支左的某部指战员，积极帮助这个厂的无产阶级革命派举办毛泽东思想学习班斗私批修，有力地促进了这个厂的革命大联合和革命三结合。这个厂八个分场中的六个分场现在已经成立了革命委员会。
    西固热电厂毛泽东思想学习班的学员，有厂、分场、科室、部门的革命干部，有各个革命群众组织的骨干，还有不同观点的革命群众组织的负责人。这些人中有的因受资产阶级反动路线的影响，互相之间对立情绪很大，还有的人过去因观点不同，根本坐不到一个凳子上。驻厂解放军和学习班学员一块学习毛主席著作，认真帮助学员学习毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、重于一切、先于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想武装无产阶级革命派，促进了人的思想革命化，发展和加强了思想上的大联合。开学的第一天，汽车队司机刘荣昌和保卫科干部张建英发生了争吵。解放军指战员就耐心地给双方做思想政治工作，用毛主席的教导帮助他们分清是非，同自己头脑中的“私”字作斗争。第二天的学习会议上，双方都作了自我批评，在毛泽东思想的基础上达到了团结，促进了思想上的大联合。
    这个工厂的革命派和革命职工，学习了毛主席的最新指示后，对干部的看法和认识也提高了。他们说，我们要坚决贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，对干部“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作”，要扩大教育面。我们对待干部的错误，不能揪住不放，要允许干部改正错误，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    西固热电厂毛泽东思想学习班采取了会上和会下相结合，学习班和厂内群众性的“斗私，批修”活动相结合的方法。
    在毛主席发出的“斗私，批修”伟大号召指引下，一个按系统实现革命大联合的局面，一个自下而上成立革命三结合的临时权力机构——革命委员会的新高潮，正在西固热电厂形成，“抓革命，促生产”也出现了一派新气象。
