The heroic military and civilian people of South Vietnam have achieved brilliant victories in the summer and autumn rainy season battles this year, bravely fighting the enemy. According to incomplete statistics, from May to September this year, a total of 143,000 enemy troops were annihilated, including 63,400 American troops and 5,500 mercenaries.

During this period, the People's Liberation Armed Forces completely annihilated 14 enemy infantry battalions, 2 engineering battalions, 6 armored units, 145 companies, 271 platoons, and 38 "pacification" teams; they shot down and destroyed more than 1,400 aircraft of various types, destroyed and damaged more than 3,100 military vehicles, and sank and damaged 107 ships and motorboats. In addition, the People's Liberation Armed Forces also destroyed about 180 enemy strongholds, 50 military region and military group command institutions, blew up 120 bridges, burned 52 oil depots with a capacity of 25 million liters of gasoline, and destroyed hundreds of heavy artillery pieces.

The report said that compared with the same period last year, the number of enemy troops annihilated has increased by more than onefold, and the number of American aggressors annihilated is close to the number annihilated in the winter and spring dry season of 1966-1967.

During this summer and autumn rainy season, the People's Liberation Armed Forces deeply penetrated into the enemy's lair, launching 35 fierce attacks on 18 enemy air bases, destroying 810 enemy aircraft, annihilating nearly 5,700 enemy troops, including 5,174 American troops.

In the battles of this summer and autumn, the People's Liberation Armed Forces took the initiative on all fronts, roamed freely, and won every battle. The military and civilian people of the Central Central Region, filled with deep hatred for the American aggressors, fought the American aggressors to death and injury. In the battles of this summer and autumn, the military and civilian people of Quang Nam Province alone annihilated 16,500 enemy troops, including 10,000 American troops. The military and civilian people of the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region near the demilitarized zone turned the American military base in Quang Tri into a graveyard for the enemy. In the areas surrounding the enemy's lair of Saigon, the People's Liberation Armed Forces attacked strongholds, set up ambushes, and devoured many of the enemy's fighting forces. In the Mekong Delta, the enemy's situation is extremely difficult, and the enemy's "river attack tactics" have suffered a shameful failure under the heavy blows of the People's Liberation Armed Forces.

    掌握主动　纵横驰骋　勇猛杀敌
    南越军民雨季大捷歼敌十四万
    被歼敌人比去年同期增一倍以上击落击毁敌机一千四百多架
    据新华社河内二日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英雄的越南南方军民，在今年夏秋季的雨季战斗中，勇猛杀敌，取得了辉煌战果。据不完全统计，从今年五月到九月，共歼灭敌人十四万三千多名，其中包括美军六万三千四百名，雇佣军五千五百名。
    在这期间，人民解放武装力量全歼敌人十四个步兵营，两个工兵营，六支装甲部队，一百四十五个连，二百七十一个排，三十八个“绥靖”队；击落击毁各种飞机一千四百多架，击毁击伤各种军车三千一百辆，击沉击伤各种船只和汽艇一百零七艘。此外，人民解放武装力量还摧毁敌人据点约一百八十个、军区和军事小组指挥机构五十个，炸毁桥梁一百二十座，烧毁容量二千五百万公升汽油的汽油库五十二个，摧毁重炮数百门。
    报道说，与去年同期相比，被歼灭的敌人增加一倍以上，而美国强盗的被歼人数接近于一九六六——一九六七年冬春旱季被歼的人数。
    人民解放武装力量，在今年夏秋雨季中深入敌人巢穴，对敌人十八个空军基地发动了三十五次猛烈进攻，击毁敌机八百一十架，歼灭敌人将近五千七百名，其中包括美军五千一百七十四名。
    在今年的夏秋季战斗中，人民解放武装力量在各个战场上掌握主动权，纵横驰骋，连战皆捷。中部中区军民怀着对美国强盗的深仇大恨，杀得美国强盗死伤累累，仅广南省军民在今年夏秋季的战斗中，就歼敌一万六千五百名，其中包括美军一万名。紧靠非军事区的广治—承天地区军民把广治的美军基地变成了敌人的坟场。在美伪集团的巢穴西贡周围地区，人民解放武装力量攻据点，打伏击，吃掉敌人许多有生力量。在湄公河三角洲敌人处境非常困难，敌人使用的“河上攻击战术”在人民解放武装力量的沉重打击下，已遭可耻的破产。
