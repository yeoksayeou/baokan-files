Only socialism can save China. Chairman Mao's words truly resonate with us poor and lower-middle peasants. Socialism is the lifeblood of the working people. Without socialism, we have nothing. Therefore, we poor and lower-middle peasants will forever follow Chairman Mao, walk the broad path of socialism, and vigorously develop the collective economy of the people's communes. However, another major capitalist roader in the party is audacious enough to collude with the Chinese Khrushchev for a long time, acting in cahoots, and sing the opposite tune to our great leader Chairman Mao. Standing on the side of landlords and capitalists, he falsely claims that the people's communes have "taken steps too fast," "exceeded the stage," and "violated objective laws." He peddles the "three freedoms and one contract" black goods of the Chinese Khrushchev, inciting people to "go it alone," attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside and achieve his counter-revolutionary goal of usurping the party and the state.

Driven by this counter-revolutionary goal, in September 1958, another major capitalist roader in the party came to our Gaoxian County to "inspect work." With his eyes closed, he did not see the strong vitality and unparalleled superiority of the people's communes but instead boasted that the people's communes were "too large in scale" and "difficult to manage." He maliciously slandered that the people's communes had "lower production than advanced cooperatives" and that the income of commune members was "lower than that of middle peasants when they were farming alone." This fellow wanted to use these nonsensical words to find grounds for his "exceeding the stage" fallacy, attempting to destroy the newly born people's communes. His intentions are so sinister!

However, the howls of another major capitalist roader in the party have not harmed the people's communes in the slightest but have instead exposed his own ugly face. We say, the people's communes are good, very good! Their birth and development fully conform to the objective laws of the socialist revolution in our country and fully represent the most urgent wishes of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The people's communes are our lifeblood, our backing. Anyone who opposes them is our sworn enemy.

The people's communes have unparalleled advantages. What we have already experienced includes:

1. The production teams have established Mao Zedong Thought schools, and everyone studies the "Three Articles." Socialist consciousness has greatly improved.
2. The root of exploitation has been fundamentally cut off, preventing polarization, and greatly liberating the productive forces.
3. The poor and lower-middle peasants are in charge, standing tall, speaking with authority, and firmly holding the reins of power.
4. The power of organization is boundless. Our entire brigade has successively set up 17 miles of high and low voltage power lines and drilled 11 deep wells. From dry fields, paddy fields, orchards to vegetable fields, we have fully realized mechanized irrigation.
5. The entire brigade focuses on agriculture, while also running rice mills, kilns, quarries, nurseries, weaving workshops, and pig farms, developing agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline industries comprehensively.
6. The land is connected in large plots, making it convenient to promote new technologies and implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" of agriculture according to local conditions.
7. With abundant fertilizer and water, grain, cotton, fruit, and vegetables have increased significantly, especially the total production of grain and apples, which has increased several times compared to the cooperative period.
8. The contributions to the state are increasing year by year, with more agricultural products delivered to the state.
9. With the leap in production, public accumulation is continuously expanding. Currently, the total public accumulation of the entire brigade has reached over 500,000 yuan. Since the cooperative period, we have adhered to the spirit of self-reliance, using our own public accumulation, in addition to setting up power lines, drilling wells, and buying cars and horses, we have also purchased one "Liberation" brand truck, one "East is Red" tractor, and two hand-held tractors, making the socialist new countryside prosperous.
10. Based on the rapid development of collective production, the living standards of commune members are continuously improving, and life is getting better and better. Everyone sings "The East is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" thousands of times.

The above facts are a slap in the face to the "exceeding the stage" fallacy of another major capitalist roader in the party!

Listen, another major capitalist roader in the party: You are distorting right and wrong, trying to use the black words of "exceeding the stage" to erase the great achievements of the people's communes, destroy the people's communes, restore capitalism in the countryside, and push us poor and lower-middle peasants back into the bitter sea of "working like cattle and horses, eating chaff and swallowing vegetables." You are dreaming in broad daylight; it will never happen!

    人民公社万岁！
    ——痛斥党内另一个最大的走资派的“超越了阶段”的谬论
    辽宁省农业劳动模范  盖县熊岳公社金星大队党支部书记、民兵指导员  徐崇让
    “只有社会主义能够救中国。”毛主席这句话，真正说到我们贫下中农的心坎上。社会主义是我们劳动人民的命根子，没有社会主义，便没有我们的一切。因此，我们贫下中农永远跟着毛主席，走社会主义康庄大道，大办人民公社集体经济。可是，党内另一个最大的走资派却狗胆包天，长期以来同中国赫鲁晓夫互相勾结，狼狈为奸，同我们伟大领袖毛主席大唱反调，他站在地主、资本家立场上，胡说什么人民公社“步子”“迈得太快了”，是“超越了阶段”，“结果违反了客观规律”。他大肆贩卖中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”黑货，煽动人们“单干”，妄图在农村复辟资本主义，以达到其篡党篡国的反革命罪恶目的。
    从这个反革命罪恶目的出发，党内另一个最大的走资派一九五八年九月蹦到我们盖县“视察”工作时，闭眼不看人民公社的强大生命力和无比优越性，却大放厥词，叫嚷什么人民公社“规模搞的这么大”，“不好领导”，并恶毒地诬蔑人民公社“不如高级社的产量高”，社员的收入“不如单干时的中农水平高”。这个家伙，想用这些胡言乱语，为他的“超越了阶段”的谬论寻找根据，企图搞垮新生的人民公社，用心多么毒辣！
    但是，党内另一个最大的走资派的嚎叫不仅无损于人民公社的一根毫毛，反而赤裸裸地暴露了他自己的丑恶嘴脸。我们说，人民公社就是好，好得很！她的诞生和发展，完全符合我国社会主义革命的客观规律，完全代表了我们广大贫下中农最迫切的愿望。人民公社是我们的命根子，是我们的靠山，谁反对她，谁就是我们不共戴天的死敌。
    人民公社有着无比的优越性，现在我们已经亲身体会到的就有：第一，生产队办起毛泽东思想大学校，人人都把“老三篇”来学，社会主义觉悟大提高。第二，从根本上斩断了剥削这条毒根，避免了两极分化，大大解放了生产力。第三，贫下中农当家作主，腰杆硬起来，说话算数，牢牢地掌握了印把子。第四，组织起来威力无穷，我们全大队先后架设高低压电路十七华里，打深井十一眼，从旱田、水田、果园到菜田，全面实现了机井水利化。第五，全大队以农为主，兼办起粮米加工厂、烘炉、采石场、苗圃、编织场、养猪场等，使农、林、牧、副业全面得到了发展。第六，土地连成片，便于推广新技术，因地制宜全面地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”。第七，肥多水足，粮、棉、果、菜大幅度增产，特别是粮谷、苹果总产量比合作化时期又有成倍增长。第八，对国家贡献越来越大，交售给国家的农产品逐年增加。第九，随着生产的飞跃发展，公共积累不断扩大，目前全大队公共积累总值已达五十多万元。从合作化以来，我们本着自力更生的精神，用自己的公共积累，除架电线打井和添车买马以外，还购置了“解放”牌大汽车一辆、“东方红”拖拉机一台、手扶拖拉机两台，使社会主义新农村欣欣向荣。第十，在集体生产大发展的基础上，社员生活不断改善，日子越过越好，大家千遍万遍放声高唱《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》。
    以上这些活生生的事实，对党内另一个最大的走资派的“超越了阶段”的谬论，真是当头一棒！
    党内另一个最大的走资派听着：你颠倒黑白，想用“超越了阶段”的黑话，抹煞人民公社的丰功伟绩，搞垮人民公社，在农村复辟资本主义，把我们贫下中农重新推到“当牛作马，吃糠咽菜”的苦海里去，让地主、富农重新骑到我们头上作威作福，那是白日作梦，永远也办不到！
