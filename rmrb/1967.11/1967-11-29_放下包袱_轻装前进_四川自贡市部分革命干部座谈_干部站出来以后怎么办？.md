The People's Armed Forces Department and the revolutionary masses of Zigong City, Sichuan Province, have been implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy, actively creating conditions for revolutionary cadres to "come out," and enabling a large number of revolutionary cadres to come out in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism. This has greatly promoted the "three-in-one combination" of the revolution in Zigong City and the struggle, criticism, and transformation in various units.

However, after some cadres come out, they have encountered new ideological problems that need to be addressed promptly. Recently, the People's Armed Forces Department of Zigong City invited a number of revolutionary leading cadres who have come out from factories, rural areas, institutions, and schools to discuss how to correctly resolve these new ideological problems.

Get rid of the "fear" and replace it with "daring," and firmly establish the "public" spirit

Most of the revolutionary cadres who have come out in Zigong City can work closely with the revolutionary youngsters, take responsibility boldly, and work actively. However, a few cadres are hesitant in their work and dare not take responsibility. What is the reason for this? The comrades who participated in the discussion meeting believe that the fundamental reason is that these comrades have not yet gotten rid of the "selfish" mindset. With "selfishness" at the forefront, they dare not say what should be said, dare not do what should be done, and dare not manage what should be managed. They always think that it is better to avoid trouble than to get involved, and it is better to do less and make fewer mistakes.

The comrades who participated in the discussion meeting pointed out: "Selfishness" breeds "fear." No matter how much one fears, the actual fear is just one: fear of losing out. They said, the more one fears, the more "selfishness" will attack oneself. "Selfishness" is the root of all evil. If one cannot get rid of "selfishness," it means that one has not learned the most fundamental lesson from the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is inevitable that one will continue to make mistakes in the future.

At the discussion meeting, everyone said: Some of us cadres have made various mistakes in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the fundamental reason is also "selfishness." Now that we have come out, we must decide to break with "selfishness," firmly establish the "public" spirit, and truly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Chairman Mao has repeatedly educated us to correct mistakes quickly and thoroughly. We should not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations, and we should become pioneers in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, daring to take on heavy responsibilities, and resolutely oppose the idea of "picking the light and avoiding the heavy, pushing the heavy responsibilities to others, and picking the light ones for oneself." Replace "fear" with "daring," replace "me" with "public," and boldly transform one's thoughts in practical struggles, making amends for past mistakes.

Ideological transformation is endless, and one cannot "relax"

Some cadres, after coming out, have developed a blindly optimistic mood. They think that "the big hurdle has been passed, and everything is fine"; "after being tested for more than a year, it's time to relax"; "since I have come out, it proves that I have no problems," and so on. Therefore, they have relaxed their ideological transformation. A few even have become arrogant and self-satisfied.

The comrades who participated in the discussion meeting analyzed the reasons for these thoughts. Everyone believes that the main reasons are: first, they have not thoroughly solved the problem of how to correctly treat the masses and their own mistakes; second, they do not understand that ideological transformation is a lifelong process. Some comrades shared their personal experiences and lessons at the meeting, saying that an important reason for their past mistakes was that they forgot the most fundamental principle: "The masses are the real heroes, while we are often naive and laughable." Once they became officials, they thought they were great, did not consult with the masses on important matters, treated people unequally, and seriously alienated themselves from the masses. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution came, they were unprepared and panicked when faced with the fiery mass movement, standing against the masses. These comrades deeply felt that: the masses' criticism and struggle against us made us lose our mistakes and shortcomings, but gain progress and improvement.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system are always lingering in people's minds and do not want to leave easily." Therefore, "we will have to carry on a long-term struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology." Everyone believes that ideological transformation is endless, and one cannot think that coming out today means that ideological transformation is complete, or that "the big hurdle has been passed" and it's time to relax. If one does not continue to listen to the masses' opinions, does not continue to accept the masses' criticism, help, and supervision, or even continues to be high and mighty, alienating oneself from the masses, one will inevitably make mistakes again. Therefore, only by following Chairman Mao's teachings: "Go to the masses, stay with the masses," "consult with the masses on important matters, and be a small student of the masses," and consciously engage in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism, can one build new merits for the people.

Learn from lessons, turning bad into good

The comrades who participated in the discussion meeting also believe that after cadres come out, how to correctly treat the mistakes made in the past, put down the burden, and march forward lightly is also a big issue.

From the current situation, many cadres have solved this problem correctly, and their spirits are renewed, their work is vigorous, and they have established new relationships with the revolutionary masses. However, some cadres who have come out are still burdened, full of worries, and feel that "they have made mistakes anyway, so they are listless." When it comes to leadership, they feel weak; when it comes to giving opinions, they feel soft-spoken; when it comes to keeping up, they feel short of breath. They always feel that they are not as good as others. Especially after encountering some setbacks in new work, they become pessimistic and hopeless. Some even have the wrong ideas of "just seeking liberation, not combination," and "just wanting to do general work, not leadership work." These phenomena show that these comrades, although they have come out in person, their thoughts are still in the "self" circle; although they have joined in, their thoughts are still outside the "three-in-one combination."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any party, any individual, mistakes are inevitable. We ask for fewer mistakes. If mistakes are made, we ask for correction, the sooner and the more thorough the better." The comrades at the meeting pointed out: Making mistakes is not a good thing, it is a bad thing, but it can be turned into a good thing through subjective efforts and the help of the masses. Towards the mistakes made in the past, one should not carry them as a burden, nor should one let go and ignore them, nor should one indulge in mistakes just because one has come out now. Instead, one should, with the spirit of "seizing the day," actively correct mistakes in future practice, boldly come out and take on work responsibilities, and definitely take "struggle against selfishness and revisionism" as the key, actively learn and apply "the three old articles," strive to transform one's worldview, and become a good cadre of the party who is selfless, works hard, is dedicated, and works diligently, forever loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and dedicates oneself to the people.

    放下包袱  轻装前进
    ——四川自贡市部分革命干部座谈“干部站出来以后怎么办？”
    陈轲　经鉴　万春
    四川省自贡市人民武装部和无产阶级革命派，贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，积极地为革命干部“亮相”创造条件，使大批革命干部在“斗私，批修”中纷纷站了出来，有力地推动了自贡市革命的“三结合”和各单位的斗、批、改。
    但是，有些干部站出来以后，又产生了一些新的思想问题，需要及时解决。最近，自贡市人民武装部，邀集部分工厂、农村、机关、学校中站出来的革命领导干部，座谈讨论如何正确解决新的思想问题。
    丢掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，大立“公”字
    自贡市站出来的革命干部，大多数都能和革命小将亲密合作，大胆负责，积极工作。但是，有少数干部在工作中缩手缩脚，不敢勇于负责。这是什么原因呢？参加座谈会的同志认为，最根本的原因，就是这些同志还没有丢掉“私”字。“私”字当头，该说的不敢说，该干的不敢干，该管的不敢管，总觉得多一事不如少一事，少干事少犯错误。
    参加座谈会的同志指出：“私”字产生了“怕”字。千怕万怕，实际上只是一怕：怕自己吃亏。他们说，越怕，“私”字越要向自己进攻。“私”字是万恶之源。丢不掉“私”字，就说明自己还没有从文化大革命中汲取最根本的教训，这就难免今后继续犯错误。
    在座谈会上，大家都说：我们有些干部在文化大革命中犯了这样那样的错误，最根本的原因，也在“私”字上。我们站出来了，就要决心与“私”字决裂，大立“公”字，真正站到毛主席的革命路线一边来。毛主席一次又一次地教育我们要迅速彻底改正错误。我们应该不辜负毛主席的期望，要做“斗私，批修”的闯将，当敢革命挑重担的先锋，坚决反对“拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑”的思想。把“怕”字换成“敢”字，把“我”字换成“公”字，大胆地在实践斗争中改造思想，将功补过。
    思想改造无止境，不能“松口气”
    还有少数干部，站出来以后，产生了盲目乐观的情绪。他们认为“大关已过，万事大吉”；“考验了一年多，现在该松口气了”；“既然我已经站了出来，那就证明我没有问题了”，等等。因此，对自己的思想改造，又放松了。个别人甚至有了骄傲自满情绪。
    参加座谈会的同志，分析了产生这些思想的原因。大家认为主要是：一，没有彻底解决如何正确对待群众和对待自己的错误的问题；二，不懂得改造思想是一辈子的事情。有的同志在会上以自己切身的经验教训说明，过去之所以犯错误，很重要的一个原因，就是忘记了“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”这条最根本的原理。官做大了，自以为了不起，有事不跟群众商量，不平等待人，严重脱离群众。文化大革命一来，毫无思想准备，被群众运动的烈火一烧，就慌了手脚，站到群众的对立面去了。这些同志深有所感地说：群众批判和斗争我们，失去的只是错误和缺点，得到的却是进步和提高。
    毛主席教导我们：“反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”因此，“我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”大家认为，思想改造无止境，决不能认为今天站了出来，就是思想改造好了，就是“大关已过”，该松口气了。如果不继续听取群众的意见，不继续接受群众的批评、帮助和监督，甚至继续象过去那样高高在上，脱离群众，那就必然要重新犯错误。因此，只有遵循毛主席的教导：“到群众里面去，和群众在一起”，“遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生”，自觉地投身到“斗私，批修”的战斗中去，才能为人民建立新的功劳。
    汲取教训，把坏事变为好事
    参加座谈会的同志还认为，干部站出来以后，怎样正确对待过去所犯的错误，放下包袱，轻装前进，也是一个大问题。
    从目前的情况来看，许多干部由于正确地解决了这个问题，他们的精神面貌一新，工作生气勃勃，与革命群众建立了新的关系。但是，有一些站出来的干部，还是包袱压身，顾虑重重，“觉得自己反正是犯了错误的，从此萎靡不振”。要领导，觉得腰板不硬；要提意见，觉得嘴软；要跑步跟上，觉得腿短。总是觉得自己不如人。特别是在新的工作中碰了一些钉子之后，就悲观失望起来。有的甚至还产生了“只求解放，不求结合”，“只想干一般工作，不想干领导工作”等错误想法。这些现象，说明了这些同志虽然人是站出来了，但思想还在“我”的小圈子里；人虽然结合进去了，但思想还在“三结合”之外。
    毛主席教导我们：“任何政党，任何个人，错误总是难免的，我们要求犯得少一点。犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”到会的同志指出：犯错误当然不是好事，是坏事，但是可以通过主观努力和群众的帮助，转化为好事。对待过去所犯的错误，应该是既不当包袱背上，又不能撒开双手不管，更不能因为自己现在已经站了出来而姑息错误，而应该以“只争朝夕”的精神，在今后的实践中积极改正错误，大胆站出来挑起工作担子，一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用“老三篇”，努力改造自己的世界观，作一个“大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干”的党的好干部，永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，为人民鞠躬尽瘁。
