When we heard the latest directives from Chairman Mao on the educational revolution over the radio, the atmosphere was electric with excitement. Chairman Mao has shown us the direction for the educational revolution, and we have responded eagerly, studying diligently and discussing thoroughly. We are determined to answer Chairman Mao's care and expectations with concrete actions.

The proletarian educational revolution is a glorious and great endeavor that has never been undertaken before, a pioneering achievement in human history. We must hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie" as the key link, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and launch a fierce attack on the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. We vow to be the vanguard of criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie, and strive to be the pioneers of the educational revolution, pushing the proletarian educational revolution to the end.

The proletarian educational revolution is an extremely sharp and complex class struggle. We must fully mobilize the masses and wage a people's war. All revolutionary teachers, students, and staff are determined to mobilize fully and be the pioneers of this great educational revolution. At the same time, we must rely on the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, persist in combining education with productive labor, conduct thorough and detailed investigations, and completely smash the old educational system.

"Many things are urgent; the heavens turn, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." In the educational revolution, we must act swiftly, practice, summarize, and improve as we go, following the great direction for the educational revolution pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, and strive to establish a brand-new proletarian educational system, curriculum, and teaching methods.

The members of our revolutionary committee are determined to take the lead in criticizing and repudiating revisionism and the bourgeoisie, discard petty-bourgeois factionalism, establish proletarian party spirit, go deep into the front lines, unite all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, shoulder heavy responsibilities, and achieve new victories in the proletarian educational revolution.

"We not only are good at destroying an old world, we also will be good at building a new world." In our hands, we must completely bury the educational system of the exploiting classes that has lasted for thousands of years and establish a completely new educational system under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    积极投入教育革命运动
    上海市叶家宅路小学革命委员会
    当我们从广播里听到毛主席关于教育革命最新指示的时候，群情振奋，一片欢腾。毛主席他老人家为我们指明了教育革命的方向，我们闻风而动，认真学习，反复讨论，决心以实际行动回答毛主席他老人家对我们的关怀和期望。
    无产阶级教育革命，是前人从来没有做过的光荣伟大的事业，是人类历史上的创举。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以“斗私，批修”为纲，发扬无产阶级革命精神，狠批反革命修正主义教育黑线，誓当斗私批修的尖兵，争做教育革命的闯将，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底。
    无产阶级教育革命，是一场极其尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，一定要充分发动群众，打好这一场“人民战争”。我们全体革命师生员工决心充分动员起来，做这场教育大革命的闯将，同时要依靠广大工农兵，坚持与工农相结合，进行深入细致的调查研究，彻底破除旧的教育制度。
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”在教育革命中，我们一定要雷厉风行地边实践、边总结、边改进，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席给我们指出的教育革命的大方向，为建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度、教学内容和教学方法而奋斗。
    我们革命委员会的成员，决心带头斗私批修，丢掉小资产阶级的派性，树立无产阶级的党性，深入第一线，团结全体革命师生员工，勇挑重担，在无产阶级教育革命中立新功。
    “我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”在我们这一代手里，一定要把几千年来的剥削阶级的教育制度彻底埋葬，把完全崭新的以毛泽东思想统帅的无产阶级教育体系树立起来。
