Albanian youth volunteer laborers held a national meeting in Tirana on November 23. Over 500 young men and women from all over the country, representing 57,000 youth volunteer laborers nationwide, reported to the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha at the meeting on their achievements in labor tempering and ideological remolding, as well as their contributions to creating socialist material wealth for the country. They also shared their experiences and unanimously expressed their resolve to continue participating in the national revolutionization movement and socialist construction.

Comrade Aliya, a member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, Comrade Changgeli, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Party of Labor, and Comrade Merro, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, also attended the meeting. Comrade Aliya, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and Comrade Enver Hoxha, delivered a congratulatory speech to the meeting.

Comrade Kasmi, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League, made a report at the meeting. He spoke about the heroic deeds of Shkuta Vata and Vuat Cera, and their great inspirational role for the youth nationwide. He pointed out that in response to Comrade Enver Hoxha's call to "go to the hills and mountains and make the hills and mountains as fertile as the plains," tens of thousands of Albanian youth took action just ten days after the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and actively participated in various activities.

He said that since this year, the broad masses of youth have striven to implement the Party's teachings on tempering themselves through labor and life, enthusiastically participating in various national and local voluntary labor activities. In the past ten months, 37,000 young people have been tempered in the two revolutionary schools of the Logjcien-Fieri railway and the mountain highway construction sites, and 20,000 young people have participated in voluntary labor to open up the mountains. In labor, the youth have cultivated the outstanding proletarian qualities of putting collective interests above personal interests and loyalty to the Party and the people, strengthened the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle, daring to win, and self-reliance, and have increasingly respected the working people of workers and peasants, gradually overcoming the bourgeois ideology of seeking comfort and a life of ease. 17,000 students from primary and secondary schools have, through labor, waged a struggle against petty-bourgeois habits and selfish, lazy thoughts, and their consciousness has significantly improved. Rural youth, through participating in collective labor, have cultivated self-awareness, organizational discipline, and strengthened the communist collective spirit, loving socialist public ownership even more. 6,000 young women from the mountains have gained new strength and courage from the collective labor school, powerfully promoting the movement to thoroughly liberate women, oppose religious superstition, and eliminate backward customs.

At the meeting, filled with a fighting atmosphere and spirit of optimism, many representatives spoke. Some shared their experiences and insights from labor, some recounted their struggles against the remnants of exploitative class thought, and some described their brave fight against a fire to save the cooperative's property. Cera, the young blind person who was received by the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, that day, spoke with emotion about how he, together with the cooperative members, fought against the rocks and boulders to fulfill the Party's call to increase grain production, and finally achieved self-sufficiency in grain three years ago.

The representatives unanimously expressed their deep love for the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha and their resolve to march forward bravely along the path indicated by the Party.

The meeting also awarded the Labor Youth League 18 grassroots organizations with the Red Banner of Excellence and adopted a telegram of respect to the Party Central Committee.

    据新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚青年义务劳动者代表二十三日在地拉那举行全国性会见。来自全国各地的五百多名男女青年，代表全国五万七千名青年义务劳动者，在大会上向党和霍查同志汇报了今年以来他们在劳动锻炼和思想改造方面的收获，以及为国家创造社会主义物质财富所作出的贡献。他们还交流了各自的经验，并一致表示了继续参加国家革命化运动和社会主义建设的坚强决心。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记阿利雅，劳动党中央委员昌戈利和阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央第一书记梅罗等领导同志也参加了会见。阿利雅同志代表党中央和霍查同志向大会致了贺词。
    劳动青年联盟中央书记处书记卡斯米在会上作了报告。他谈到了什库塔·瓦塔和弗阿特·采拉的英雄事迹，对于全国青年的巨大鼓舞作用。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚成千上万的青年响应霍查同志“到丘陵和山区去，把丘陵和山区变得象平原那样富饶”的号召，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会十天后就行动起来，积极参加各项活动。
    他说，今年以来，广大青年努力贯彻劳动党关于到劳动和生活中经受锻炼的教导，踊跃参加各项全国性的和地方性的义务劳动。十个月来，三万七千名青年在洛格齐恩—费里铁路工地和大山公路工地这两所革命大学校里受到了锻炼，二万名青年参加了山区开荒的义务劳动。在劳动中，青年们培养了把集体利益置于个人利益之上和忠于党和人民的无产阶级优秀品质，增强了敢于斗争、敢于胜利和自力更生的革命精神，更加尊敬工农劳动群众，逐步克服了贪图安逸和舒适生活的资产阶级思想。一万七千名大中学生通过劳动，同小资产阶级习气和自私自利、好逸恶劳的思想展开了斗争，觉悟有了显著提高。来自农村的青年通过参加集体劳动，培养了自觉性、组织性和纪律性，树立和加强了共产主义的集体精神，更加热爱社会主义公有制。六千名山区女青年从集体劳动的大学校里，获得了新的力量，增强了革命的勇气，有力地促进了彻底解放妇女、反对宗教迷信和落后习俗运动的开展。
    在充满着战斗气氛和乐观主义精神的大会上，许多代表发了言。他们有的介绍了自己在劳动中的心得体会，有的讲述了他们为了抢救合作社财产同大火进行搏斗的经过；有的讲述了他们勇敢地起来向剥削阶级思想残余展开坚决斗争的体会。当天受到阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大领袖霍查同志接见的青年盲人采拉，怀着激动的心情向代表们介绍了他怎样同合作社社员一起，为实现党的增产粮食的号召，向山岩乱石展开搏斗，终于在三年前就达到粮食自给的经过。
    代表们在发言中一致表达了青年一代对劳动党和霍查同志无比热爱的心情和永远沿着党所指引的道路奋勇前进的决心。
    大会还授予劳动青年联盟十八个基层组织以优胜红旗，并通过了给党中央的致敬电。
