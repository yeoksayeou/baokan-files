An important experience of the international communist movement is that the development, victory, and consolidation of a revolution depend on whether there is a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary party. The Communist Party of China was founded and nurtured by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our great leader Chairman Mao. Since the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state, founded by the great Lenin, were led by the Khrushchev revisionists onto the path of revisionism, capitalism has been fully restored in the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Party and state have become the center of modern counter-revolutionary revisionism. The center of the world revolution has shifted to Beijing. The Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, has been seen by the people of the world as a powerful red fortress of light and hope. China has become the red base of the world revolution. International imperialism, in order to consolidate its rule, places its hopes on the peaceful evolution of New China into a capitalist country, first and foremost by hoping that the Communist Party of China will degenerate into a revisionist party, a fascist party. The Chinese Khrushchev has acted as the agent of the domestic and foreign class enemies within our party. For decades, he has arrogantly posed as the "authority on party building" and crazily promoted a revisionist party-building line. The party he wants to build is not a Marxist-Leninist party, but a revisionist party, a fascist party. He is not an "authority on party building" at all, but an unadulterated big bureaucrat, big opportunist, and big conspirator. Thoroughly settling accounts with his revisionist party-building line and forever preserving the bright red color of our party is not only related to the future and destiny of the Chinese revolution but also to the future and destiny of the world revolution.

What kind of political line will build what kind of party

All parties are tools of class struggle, representing the interests of a certain class, and have political lines representing their class interests. What kind of political line there is, there will necessarily be what kind of party. To build a Marxist-Leninist party, one must have a Marxist-Leninist political line.

During the period of the democratic revolution, Chairman Mao taught us: "The process of party building, the process of Bolshevizing the party, is so closely linked to the party's political line, so closely linked to the party's correct or incorrect handling of the united front and armed struggle." Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist political line in various historical periods of the Chinese revolution has pointed out the only correct direction and path for our party's construction. Over the decades, our party has developed and grown stronger along this direction and path, from victory to victory.

The Chinese Khrushchev, over a long period, has always wanted to promote capitalism, never for socialism in China. His political line has always been bourgeois, not proletarian. During the period of the democratic revolution in our country, he did everything he could to consolidate the rule of the big landlords, big bourgeoisie, and their representative, the Kuomintang's Chiang Kai-shek. After the victory of the democratic revolution, he schemed to establish bourgeois dictatorship in China and restore capitalism. From this counter-revolutionary political line, during the period of the democratic revolution, he attempted to turn our party into a puppet of the Kuomintang. After the victory of the democratic revolution, he attempted to turn our party into a tool for restoring capitalism. In short, he wanted our party to degenerate into a revisionist party, a fascist party.

During the period of the democratic revolution, the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promoted class capitulationism, betrayed the leadership of the Chinese revolution, and attempted to make our party follow the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, becoming a party led by the Kuomintang. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he advocated handing over the leadership of the united front to the Kuomintang. He said that the Kuomintang was the "most popular, legal form of the anti-Japanese national united front, the best ready-made form," and strongly advocated that the Communist Party should participate in the "anti-Japanese united front led by the big bourgeoisie." He praised the Kuomintang as the "flag of revolution" and Chiang Kai-shek as the "leader of the war of resistance and national construction," and so on. This Chinese Khrushchev once dressed himself up as a "hero" opposing Wang Ming's right opportunism, but his fallacies are completely of the same ilk as Wang Ming's "everything through the united front, everything subject to the united front." He completely betrayed Chairman Mao's policy of independence within the united front and completely abandoned the Communist Party of China's responsibility to lead the War of Resistance Against Japan. At that time, the Kuomintang pursued a fascist dictatorship of "one party, one ideology, one leader" and implemented the policy of "limiting, dissolving, and annihilating" the Communist Party. If we followed the "leadership" of the big bourgeoisie and the "leadership" of Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, we would be tying our own hands and feet, willingly executing the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary "Regulations for Restricting the Activities of Other Parties" and putting our party in jeopardy. If our party were to follow the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek of the Kuomintang, then as early as 1943, the Kuomintang would have "ordered" the "dissolution" of the Communist Party of China. Then, the Communist Party of China would no longer exist, and what would there be to talk about the consolidation and development of the party?

Our great leader Chairman Mao led the whole party to resolutely oppose this line of capitulation and resolutely implemented the political line of "developing progressive forces, winning over middle forces, and isolating diehard forces," and carried out the policy of independence within the united front. This both did not break the united front and did not tie our own hands and feet. This greatly consolidated and developed the party's ranks, expanded the liberated areas and the People's Liberation Army.

Seizing power by armed force and solving problems through war are fundamental principles of Marxism-Leninism. Chairman Mao taught us: "An important part of our political line is armed struggle." "The development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our party have been carried out in revolutionary wars. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today." The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously opposed armed struggle and attempted to betray the people's army. He once fervently advocated that our party's army be reorganized into the "national army" (Kuomintang army), "abolish party organizations in the army," and "all parties stop direct leadership and command of the army, unified under the Ministry of Defense" (Kuomintang's Ministry of Defense). This is utterly absurd and shameless! Handing over our party's army is betraying our party. This is exactly what the dictator Chiang Kai-shek wanted. Didn't Chiang Kai-shek slander our revolutionary armed forces as "bandit armies," "rebel armies," and "bandit armies"? Didn't he repeatedly demand that our party's army obey his "military orders" and "political orders"? Didn't he want to "annihilate" the New Fourth Army and order its dissolution? Chiang Kai-shek clearly knew that to annihilate the Communist Party, he must first annihilate our party's revolutionary armed forces. The fundamental reason why Chiang Kai-shek hated and feared the Communist Party so much is that our party had control of the revolutionary armed forces.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without an army of the people, there will be nothing for the people." During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the party's organization developed but was not consolidated, and one of the important reasons was that the party did not control a batch of revolutionary armed forces in its hands. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, the party's organization developed again and was consolidated, and the party made significant progress and achieved success. One of the important reasons was that the party created a strong armed force. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the party's organization came out of a narrow circle and became a national party. One of the important reasons was that the party's armed forces grew stronger again and became more consolidated. We have not forgotten this experience bought with blood.

The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to make our party accept the leadership of the Kuomintang and hand over the party's army, all for the purpose of making our party become the "legal party" he advocated and enter the "parliament." The law he wanted to abide by was the fascist political law of the Kuomintang, and the parliament he wanted to enter was the bourgeois pseudo-democratic parliament with the Communist Party entering as a "cultural organization." Here, he blatantly exposed his true face as a yes-man of Chiang Kai-shek. Chiang Kai-shek had long said that the Communist Party could have a "legal status," but the condition was to hand over the army. In this way, the party could not only be "legal" and enter the "parliament" as a "cultural organization," but Communist Party members could also go to the Kuomintang government to be officials. If this were really done, then the Communist Party of China would become a puppet of the Kuomintang, a thoroughly traitorous revisionist party.

Our great leader Chairman Mao directly refuted Chiang Kai-shek's fallacies, forming a sharp contrast with the Chinese Khrushchev. Chairman Mao, in response to the argument that the Communist Party should enter the "parliament" as a so-called "cultural organization," said resolutely: "We are not a 'cultural organization'; we have an army, we are a 'militarized organization.'" In response to the argument that the Communist Party should hand over the army to be given a so-called "legal status," he pointed out with great momentum: "We have not handed over the army, so we have no legal status, we are 'lawless and heaven-defying.'" Precisely because we have followed the course set by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, we have maintained and expanded the "militarized organization," we have been "lawless and heaven-defying," and this has enabled our party to fight effectively for the interests of the Chinese people, gain the support of the people, achieve victory in the war of resistance, establish New China, establish socialism, and have today's great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China.

After the proletariat seizes power, the party's central task is still to carry out class struggle, to struggle for the implementation of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the consolidation of the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the fundamental issue of the party's political line throughout the entire historical period of socialism. Chairman Mao taught us: In this historical stage of socialism, it is necessary to insist on the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out the socialist revolution to the end in order to prevent the restoration of capitalism, carry out socialist construction, and prepare the conditions for the transition to communism. The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated the "extinction of class struggle" and crazily opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the means of production, when the issue of who wins and who loses between the two roads had not yet been truly resolved, he said that "the issue of whether socialism or capitalism will win in our country has now been resolved," and "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended." In the future, "the party's main task is to develop productive forces as quickly as possible." This is almost identical to what Khrushchev said. Didn't Khrushchev also say that "under socialist conditions, the economy is more important than politics," and "the main thing in the work of party organs is production," and change the Soviet Party into an "industrial party" and an "agricultural party"? In fact, the Chinese Khrushchev was not willing to fall behind. He vigorously promoted the "expert party," opening the door to the bourgeois so-called "experts" and "high-level intellectuals," and pulling some bourgeois academic "authorities" and ghosts and snakes into the party, in order to achieve his evil goal of changing the nature of the party and restoring capitalism.

Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and scientifically expounded on the classes, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society and proposed the theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao pointed out: A small handful of power-holders within the party who are walking the capitalist road are the representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party. They are our most dangerous enemies. The Chinese Khrushchev is the biggest power-holder within the party who is walking the capitalist road. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, this biggest power-holder within the party who is walking the capitalist road was finally exposed. The broad masses of revolutionary people brandished the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly exposed and criticized his heinous crimes of implementing the bourgeois reactionary line for decades, engaging in anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities, and also thoroughly settled accounts with his revisionist line in party building and peeled off his fake "authority on party building." Through this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our party will definitely become stronger and healthier, with a higher level of Marxism-Leninism, and will open a new era for the construction of the proletarian party.

Chairman Mao's Marxist-Leninist political line for our party is the soul of our party's construction. Chairman Mao's political line has guided our party to develop, consolidate, and further Bolshevize; the more the party Bolshevizes, the more it can and will be able to correctly handle the party's political line and lead the revolutionary cause from victory to victory. The Chinese Khrushchev's greatest crime in party building is that he promoted a revisionist political line and attempted to fundamentally change the nature of the party. To build a politically mature great Marxist party, the most important thing, the most important thing, is to implement the political line formulated by Chairman Mao for our party.

Is it the vanguard of the proletariat or a revisionist "people's party"?

The proletarian party is the highest form of organization of the proletariat. Like all revisionists, the Chinese Khrushchev tried to cover up the class nature of our party and change the nature of the proletarian vanguard party. He said that the party "should be responsible to the masses," and that "outside the party, there are many excellent people, even better than our Communist Party members, but they have not joined." Therefore, the Communist Party should become the "party of the masses," the "party of the people," the "party of good people." Anyone can see that the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies are not new. They are completely of the same ilk as Khrushchev's "people's party" theory, a thorough revisionist and anti-Marxist-Leninist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought product.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The concept of the people has different contents in different countries and in different historical periods of each country." In the current stage of our country, the people include not only the working class but also the peasant class, the urban petty bourgeoisie, and the national bourgeoisie. According to the theory of the Chinese Khrushchev, shouldn't our party be both the party of the peasants, petty bourgeoisie, and the bourgeoisie?

According to the Chinese Khrushchev, since the party "should be responsible to the masses," it should become the "party of the masses." Then, the Communist Party has always been responsible to the masses, so shouldn't it originally not be a proletarian party but a "party of the masses"?

The concept of "good people" in a class society has a clear class nature. Comrade Lin Biao said: "No one is not a member of a certain class, always belonging to a certain social relationship, a certain class." Deng Tuo was a traitor to the proletariat, and we say he is a bad person. The Chinese Khrushchev, standing on a reactionary position, said: "This person is loyal to the enemy and also loyal to the party." Facts clearly tell people that good and bad, right and wrong, good and evil have completely different standards in different classes.

In short, the Chinese Khrushchev talked about a super-class "people's party," "party of the masses," "party of good people" above all classes, which is pure nonsense!

In fact, the Chinese Khrushchev did not promote a "people's party," "party of the masses," or "party of good people." In the work of party development, he long adopted a closed-door policy towards workers and peasants, but what he always remembered was what the capitalist "entering the party would be even better," what "there is no fear of having 10,000 rich peasant party members in the Northeast," and what "filling out the 'voluntary surrender form'" or writing the "anti-Communist voluntary statement" can "restore their organizational status," and even "can be elected as a Central Committee member"! And what "smoking opium," "being a bandit," "why can't they join the party"? What "spy traitors" "cannot be prevented from mixing in a little"? All these are the "people," "masses," and "good people" in the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev. A party composed of such people, how can it be called a "people's party," "party of the masses," "party of good people"? This is clearly a mess of all sorts of rubbish! The Chinese Khrushchev peddled Khrushchev's "people's party" as if it were genuine, but where is the real "people's party"? It is either the vanguard of the proletariat or the "people" of the entire bourgeoisie, the "people" of all ghosts and snakes. Whether it is Khrushchev's "people's party" or the Chinese Khrushchev's "people's party," "party of the masses," "party of good people," they are just aliases and fig leaves for revisionist parties and fascist parties.

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to pull these social dregs into the party, also said that this is "in accordance with party rules and regulations." This is sheer nonsense and a great slander against our party.

Ask, does the party of Marxism-Leninism have "party rules and regulations" that allow rich peasants and capitalists to join? If so, would this party not become a bourgeois party, and what communism would there be to talk about?

Ask, does the party of Marxism-Leninism have "party rules and regulations" that allow traitors who surrender to join, even to become Central Committee members? If so, would this party not become the Kuomintang of Wang Jingwei, which advocates "indirect salvation"?

Ask, does the party of Marxism-Leninism have "party rules and regulations" that allow people with various personal motives to join? If so, would this party not become a charitable organization and a place of exchange for personal gain?

Ask, does the party of Marxism-Leninism have "party rules and regulations" that allow spies, bandits, opium addicts, and religious believers to join? If so, would this party not become the Green Gang of Huang Jinrong?

The "party rules and regulations" in the eyes of the Chinese Khrushchev are a textbook example of a revisionist party and a fascist party.

The Communist Party is the vanguard of the proletariat. Such a party can only be composed of advanced elements who are infinitely loyal to the historical mission of the proletariat. This is a major principle related to the nature of the proletarian party and an important experience of the international communist movement. Our great leader Chairman Mao has always emphasized: "We are the Communist Party. We must lead the people to overthrow the enemy. Our ranks must be in order, and our steps must be in unison. Our soldiers must be elite, and our weapons must be good. If these conditions are not met, then the enemy will not be defeated by us." Lenin also emphasized: "Our task is to protect the solidity, firmness, and purity of our party. We should strive to raise the title and role of party members, raise, raise, and raise again." The Chinese Khrushchev attempted to pull the ghosts and snakes of society into the party, which was to turn the vanguard of the proletariat into a big mess of the bourgeoisie, in order to serve his plot to seize the party and achieve his evil goal of restoring capitalism. If it were not for Chairman Mao's party-building line occupying the dominant position, and if it were not for this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution exposing the Chinese Khrushchev, then in a few years, our party would inevitably degenerate into a revisionist party and a fascist party.

To transform the party with the worldview of the proletariat or to transform the party with the worldview of the bourgeoisie

Using the worldview of the proletariat to educate party members and guide all activities and work of the party has always been the most important task of the party. Chairman Mao has always emphasized the political and ideological construction of the party, stressing the extreme importance of using the worldview of the proletariat to transform party members and promote the revolutionization of party members' thinking. Chairman Mao's emphasis on building the party politically and ideologically is a great contribution to Marxism-Leninism, making our party established on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought from the beginning, becoming a politically mature great Marxist party. The revisionist party-building line of the Chinese Khrushchev, reflected in the ideological construction of the party, is to transform the party with his bourgeois worldview, opposing the worldview of the proletariat, and opposing the highest and most concentrated representative of the worldview of the proletariat, Mao Zedong Thought.

The worldview of the Chinese Khrushchev inherited both the revisionism of Bernstein and Kautsky and mixed in some native "Confucian and Mencian" ideas, combining the life philosophy of the bourgeoisie and feudal scholars. His worldview boils down to one point: an "ego," extreme bourgeois egoism. He shamelessly advocated: "Taking small advantages leads to big losses, taking small losses leads to big advantages. This is in accordance with the proletarian worldview of Marxism-Leninism," and arrogantly shouted, "It is not selflessness, but public and private, public and private, first public then private." This laid bare the most filthy and essential thing in his soul: "First bitter then sweet," "benefit first," starting from the individual, ending with the individual, the purpose of "public" is for private, in short, the individual first. This is his philosophy of life, dealing with people, and dealing with himself, "enlightened" by Confucius and Mencius, "cultivated" by Bernstein and Kautsky. He turned the revolution into a place for speculation, turned the party into a "limited liability company," and "if the company makes money, the shareholders get a share." His theory of "public and private fusion" is a variant of Bernstein and Kautsky's conciliationism and eclecticism; his fallacy of "taking small losses, gaining big advantages" is a new interpretation of Confucius' "small patience, then chaos," "seeing small gains, then big things will not succeed." In the end, it is all about fake public for private gain, extreme egoism, and is fundamentally opposed to Chairman Mao's "selflessness," "complete selflessness and dedication to others" proletarian worldview.

The bourgeois worldview of the Chinese Khrushchev, with "ego" as the core, has caused the most serious harm to the party in different historical periods:

First, the philosophy of survival. In times of war and white terror, how each party member correctly handles the contradiction between life and death is a concentrated reflection of what kind of worldview. Our revolutionary forebears and martyrs, "great in life, glorious in death." For the victory of the revolution, for the cause of the party, they went in and out of life and death under the enemy's gunfire, bravely sacrificed themselves under the enemy's butcher knife, and wrote countless heroic epics. But the Chinese Khrushchev sang a different tune, saying that a Communist Party member should "cherish oneself, protect one's life and health," and that the party, "under possible conditions, ... should give up some of the party's work to preserve comrades." Look, isn't this singing praises for deserters on the front line, traitors who kneel to the enemy? What is the difference between this and the so-called "better to live miserably than die well" of old and new revisionism? What is the difference between this and Wang Jingwei's "indirect salvation"? It was under this beautiful rhetoric that he instigated a large number of "Communist Party members" to betray and surrender in prison. The Chinese Khrushchev's set of "survival" fallacies is the public opinion preparation for his plot to surrender and form factions.

Second, the "way to promotion and wealth." After the founding of New China, our party became the ruling party. Whether our party members are for revolution or for officialdom has become a prominent contradiction reflecting what kind of worldview in the new historical period. Chairman Mao taught us, "We Communists are not to be officials, but to make revolution." But the Chinese Khrushchev repeatedly advocated Mencius' "desire for nobility is the common heart of people," treating promotion and wealth as the common psychology of people, and using Mencius' "everyone can be a sage" as a slogan, urging people to strive for a lifetime for "climbing up." He even blatantly advocated "being able to be an official" as a slogan, urging people to "examine" Communist Party members, saying, "In the past, one examined for the position of a scholar, and now one examines for the position of a Communist Party member," "In the past, one became a scholar and could be an official, and now one joins the Communist Party and can be an official." Isn't this encouraging people to mix in the title of "Communist Party member" as a stepping stone for promotion and wealth? If this were really done, then our party would degenerate into a club for political careerists and all kinds of speculators.

The struggle between the worldview of the proletariat and the worldview of the bourgeoisie boils down to one point: is it for the public or for the private? In people's minds, it is either the "public" in power or the "private" in power. One public and one private, one rises and the other falls, either this or that, life and death struggle. The Chinese Khrushchev so crazily peddled the black goods of feudalism and capitalism, providing "theoretical" basis for some bourgeois individualists whose worldview has not been transformed, making those who struggle for power and fame, and those who sneak into the party become legalized. This makes our party face such a danger: bourgeois individualism will freely spread within the party, and the original Communist Party members who were determined to make a revolution will also be shackled by that decayed and fallen spiritual shackle, becoming the sacrifice of the struggle in the arena of fame and wealth, becoming his tame tool for seizing the party and the government, and finally making the Marxist-Leninist party degenerate into a revisionist party and a fascist party.

Regarding the danger encountered in the construction of the party, Chairman Mao, as early as the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, issued a serious warning to those who attempted to transform our party with the worldview of the bourgeoisie: "Your way is no good. The proletariat cannot accommodate you. If we follow you, we will actually follow the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and there will be the danger of the party and the country perishing. Who can we rely on? We can only rely on transforming the party and the world according to the image of the vanguard of the proletariat." Transforming the party and the world with the worldview of the proletariat is to transform the party and the world with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao has always held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest. He called on the whole country and the whole army to launch a mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works, quickly launching a new high tide of the mass movement to study Chairman Mao's works throughout the party and the country. The broad Communist Party members, together with the people of the whole country, further armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, in the three great revolutionary movements, used Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, thoroughly smashed the worldview of the bourgeoisie, thoroughly established the worldview of the proletariat, thoroughly smashed "ego," thoroughly established "public," and firmly established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, making outstanding contributions to the revolutionary construction of our party.

At present, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters a new stage, the whole party and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat throughout the country, as well as the broad revolutionary people, actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, vowing to kick the rotten goods of the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois worldview into the garbage heap of history, ensuring that the party is built according to the worldview of the proletariat, according to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

To implement the democratic centralism of the party or to promote slavery and anarchism

The Chinese Khrushchev promoted the revisionist party-building line and wantonly trampled on the democratic centralism, the fundamental organizational principle of the party, distorting the democratic centralism beyond recognition.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The unity of democracy and centralism, the unity of freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism." Our democratic centralism is centralism on the basis of democracy, democracy under centralized guidance. We should not emphasize one aspect while denying the other. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, said that "the party's leaders and higher-level organs should pay more attention to democracy; the party's led and lower-level organs should obey more." This means that in his mind, democracy and centralism are subject to the personal will of the "superior" and "leader," "centralism" is the privilege of the superior, and "democracy" is just a favor granted by the superior to the inferior. Democracy and centralism thus become two different goods, each with its own use, two counter-revolutionary hands.

Before the revisionist face of the Chinese Khrushchev was thoroughly exposed, he always waved the banner of the party's centralism and discipline, peddling the black goods of slavery. Whether it is democracy or centralism, in his eyes, there is only one interpretation, that is, "obedience"! "Absolute obedience"! "Even if it is wrong, you must obey"! Party members must become his "tame tool." Whoever does not listen to him will be beaten with a stick and wear a hat. He openly advocated that "the superior and the majority should be correct in principle and politically" as the condition for "obedience," "it is wrong," "should be unconditional, absolute obedience," "if the Chinese Party has a Khrushchev coup, ... the majority opinion is wrong, ... it should also be 'the minority obeys the majority,'" otherwise, it is "destroying party unity," it is the "greatest crime." What a ferocious face! In plain words, it is only he who can seize the party and betray the party, and it is not allowed for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat to rebel against him. What does this have to do with the democratic centralism of the proletariat?

The Marxist-Leninist party talks about centralism. But this centralism is centralism on the basis of democracy, unifying thought and action on the basis of centralizing correct opinions. If according to the advocacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, even wrong opinions should be obeyed, then would the democratic centralism not become the personal dictatorship of the Chinese Khrushchev? The Marxist-Leninist party has always opposed the blind obedience based on the "superior" concept. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Communist Party members should question everything, think it over carefully in their own minds, and see if it is in accordance with reality and if it is reasonable. They should never blindly follow and never advocate slavery." The Chinese Khrushchev said that obedience is unconditional and absolute, but this is completely self-deceiving and deceiving nonsense. If obedience is unconditional, then why do you always oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? If obedience is absolute, then why do you not obey the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao? In short, the "obedience" of the Chinese Khrushchev is also conditional, that is, it can only obey his bourgeois reactionary line and cannot obey Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The obedience of the proletarian party is based on the precondition of being politically and principledly correct. The organizational line must be subordinate to the political line. To make the lower levels obey, the "party's leading organs must have the correct guiding line" first. This correct guiding line is Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This is the precondition for obedience. Whatever is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, we will resolutely obey and carry it out, and whatever is against Mao Zedong Thought, no matter if it is the "majority" or which "superior," we will resolutely oppose and not carry it out. Chairman Mao taught us: "The erroneous leadership that harms the revolution should not be unconditionally accepted but should be resolutely resisted." Resisting erroneous leadership is precisely to better obey the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao.

The so-called not obeying erroneous leadership is destroying "party unity," this is complete nonsense. Lenin pointed out: "Unity, this is a great cause and a great slogan! But what the working class needs is the unity of Marxists, not the unity of Marxists with those who oppose and distort Marxism." Our unity is principled; it is unity on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, unity under the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, unity under Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Obeying the leadership of the Chinese Khrushchev and talking about unity with the likes of the Chinese Khrushchev is a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. Engels said: "Don't let the cry of 'unity' confuse you. Those who shout this slogan the loudest are precisely the instigators of division." In fact, the one who destroys the unity and solidarity of the party is not someone else but the Chinese Khrushchev.

It is worth noting that the Chinese Khrushchev sometimes also acts in an extremely "leftist" manner, talking a lot about "party democracy." His "democracy" is nothing but "general suspicion, general overthrow" anarchism. It was this Chinese Khrushchev who, in 1962, talked a lot about "promoting party democracy," slandering our party for lacking democratic life and committing the error of "excessive struggle." It was still this Chinese Khrushchev who, in this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when his reactionary face was increasingly exposed and his days were getting harder and harder, no longer talked about "the minority obeying the majority" but talked a lot about the high-sounding "protecting the minority." The "minority" he wanted to protect was the handful of capitalist roaders within the party and the ghosts and snakes in society who opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He also vigorously advocated the reactionary fallacy of "general suspicion, general overthrow" anarchism, and in the matter of cadres, crazily promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area, protecting a small number."

Sometimes extremely right-wing, in his mind there is only fascist dictatorship, democracy is worthless; sometimes extremely "left-wing," democracy is above everything, throwing centralism and discipline into the clouds. This strange phenomenon can only have one explanation, that is, all revisionists are pragmatists. As long as it is beneficial to him, it is the truth. So when he was in power, he used slavery to maintain his rule, and when he was facing bankruptcy, he threw out anarchism, trying to confuse the revolutionary ranks, so that he could escape. However, contrary to the wishes of the Chinese Khrushchev, both the "left" and "right" hands did not save him from his failure. It can be said that his disciples following his footsteps will not have a better fate!

Chairman Mao taught us: "To make the party powerful, rely on implementing the democratic centralism of the party to mobilize the initiative of the whole party." Only by implementing democratic centralism can the whole party be united and the tasks of the party in various periods be successfully accomplished. The Chinese Khrushchev wantonly distorted the democratic centralism of the party, precisely to make our party lose its revolutionary nature and combat effectiveness, in order to achieve his sinister goal of seizing the party. However, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, our party will still unswervingly implement the democratic centralism of the proletariat, making our party and state "create a political situation that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, both unified in will and individual spirits are comfortable, lively and vivid." Let the slavery and anarchism of the Chinese Khrushchev go to hell!

"Once the wind rises from the earth, there will be heroes born from the pile of white bones." The history of our party is the history of the struggle between the two lines, the history of the victory and development of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Exposing and pulling out the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, with the Chinese Khrushchev as the representative, and destroying the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the party is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's party-building line. Our party has become stronger, more vigorous, and with a higher level of Marxism-Leninism. Our party daring to lead and initiate this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has further proven that our party is indeed the great, glorious, and correct party founded and nurtured by Chairman Mao.

Although the Chinese Khrushchev has been pulled down and sidelined by us, his bourgeois reactionary line and the "corpse" of his bourgeois worldview are still rotting around us, continuing to poison our souls. Therefore, the fundamental task facing us is, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great line of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, to consolidate the great alliance of the revolution, further deepen the great criticism of the revolution, do a good job of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, deeply, thoroughly, overthrow, and stink him, thoroughly eliminate his poison, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and thoroughly transform the worldview. Otherwise, we will not be able to uproot the root of revisionism and achieve the fundamental purpose of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The world has entered the new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao and the Communist Party of China have become the beacon of the world revolution. Further consolidating, developing, and strengthening our party is the hope of the Chinese people and also the hope of the revolutionary people of the world. As long as we firmly follow the political direction indicated by Chairman Mao and build our party with Mao Zedong Thought, we will definitely achieve our goal, definitely accomplish the great mission entrusted to us by history, and definitely not disappoint the expectations of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world for us.

Building the party with Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct path. This is true not only in China but also in foreign countries. All revolutionary communists and the broad revolutionary people of the world will unite under the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, sweep away the muddy waters of Khrushchev revisionism, and strive to create a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without the system of exploitation.

    战无不胜的毛泽东思想是我党建设的灵魂
    ——彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线
    海军直属机关　红联总
    国际共产主义运动的一个最重要的经验是：革命能不能得到发展，能不能取得胜利和巩固胜利，取决于有没有一个马克思列宁主义的革命党。中国共产党是由当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们的伟大导师毛主席亲手缔造和培育的伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。自从伟大的列宁创建的苏联共产党和苏维埃国家被赫鲁晓夫修正主义者引上修正主义的道路以后，资本主义在苏联全面复辟，苏联党和国家已成为现代反革命修正主义的中心。世界革命的中心已经转到北京。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，已被世界人民看作光明和希望的强大的红色堡垒，中国已成为世界革命的红色根据地。国际帝国主义为了巩固它的统治，把希望寄托在新中国和平演变为资本主义国家，首先是把希望寄托在中国共产党蜕化为修正主义党、法西斯党。中国赫鲁晓夫充当了国内外阶级敌人在我们党内的代理人。他为了使我们党变质，几十年来，俨然以“建党权威”自居，疯狂地推行了一条修正主义的建党路线。他要建设的党，根本不是马克思列宁主义的党，而是修正主义的党，法西斯党。他根本不是什么“建党权威”，而是不折不扣的大党阀、大野心家、大阴谋家。彻底清算他的修正主义建党路线，永远保持我们党的鲜红颜色，这不仅关系到中国革命的前途和命运，而且关系到世界革命的前途和命运。
    什么样的政治路线，就会建设什么样的党
    一切政党都是阶级斗争的工具，都是代表一定阶级的利益的，都有着代表自己阶级利益的政治路线。有什么样的政治路线，就必然会建设什么样的党。要建设一个马克思列宁主义的党，就必须有一条马克思列宁主义的政治路线。
    毛主席在民主革命时期就教导我们：“党的建设过程，党的布尔塞维克化的过程，是这样同党的政治路线密切地联系着，是这样同党对于统一战线问题、武装斗争问题之正确处理或不正确处理密切地联系着的。”毛主席在中国革命各个历史时期制定的马克思列宁主义的政治路线，为我们党的建设指明了唯一正确的方向和道路。几十年来，我们党正是沿着这个方向和道路不断发展壮大，从胜利走向胜利的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫长期以来，他所想的、说的和做的，归根到底都是要搞资本主义，从来都不是为了在中国搞社会主义。他一贯推行的政治路线，是资产阶级的，根本不是无产阶级的。在我国民主革命时期，他千方百计地为巩固大地主、大资产阶级及其代表国民党蒋介石的反动统治而效劳；在民主革命胜利之后，他处心积虑地要在中国建立资产阶级专政，复辟资本主义。从这条反革命的政治路线出发，在民主革命时期，他妄图把我们党变成国民党的附庸，在民主革命胜利后，妄图把我们党变成复辟资本主义的工具。总之，是要把我们党蜕变为修正主义党、法西斯党。
    在民主革命时期，中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行阶级投降主义，出卖中国革命的领导权，妄图使我们党追随大地主、大资产阶级，成为受国民党领导的党。在抗日战争时期，他鼓吹把民族统一战线的领导权拱手交给国民党。他胡说什么国民党是“抗日民族统一战线最通俗的，合法的组织形式，最好的现成形式”，极力主张共产党要参加“以大资产阶级为领导的抗日统一战线”，吹捧国民党是“革命的旗帜”，“蒋介石是抗战建国的领导者”，等等。这个中国赫鲁晓夫曾经把自己装扮成反王明右倾机会主义的“英雄”，其实他的这套谬论，和王明的“一切经过统一战线，一切服从统一战线”完全是一路货色。他完全违背了毛主席关于统一战线中独立自主的方针，完全放弃了中国共产党对于抗日战争的领导责任。当时国民党奉行的是“一个党，一个主义，一个领袖”的法西斯独裁政治，对我党实行的是“限共”、“溶共”、“灭共”的方针。如果服从大资产阶级“领导”，服从国民党蒋介石“领导”，那就是自己把自己的手脚束缚起来，就是心甘情愿地去执行国民党那个反革命的《限制异党活动办法》，把我党置于死地。如果我党要服从国民党蒋介石的领导，那早在一九四三年，国民党就“命令”“解散”中国共产党。那么，中国共产党也早就不存在了，那还有什么党的巩固和发展呢？
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席领导全党坚决反对了这条投降主义的政治路线，坚决执行了“发展进步势力，争取中间势力，孤立顽固势力”的政治路线，贯彻了在统一战线中独立自主的方针，既不破裂统一战线，又不束缚自己的手脚。这就有力地巩固和发展了党的队伍，扩大了解放区和人民解放军。
    武装夺取政权，战争解决问题，是马克思列宁主义的根本原则。毛主席教导我们说：“我们的政治路线的重要一部分就是武装斗争。”“我们党的发展、巩固和布尔塞维克化，是在革命战争中进行的，没有武装斗争，就不会有今天的共产党。”中国赫鲁晓夫极力反对武装斗争，妄图出卖人民军队。他曾经狂热地鼓吹把我党的军队整编为“国军”（国民党军），“在军队中取消党的组织”，“各党停止对军队的直接领导、指挥，统一于国防部”（国民党的国防部）。真是荒谬、无耻之极！交出了我党的军队，就是叛卖了我们的党。这是独夫民贼蒋介石求之不得的事。蒋介石不是诬蔑我党的革命武装为“奸军”“匪军”“叛军”吗？他不是口口声声要我党的军队服从他的“军令”“政令”吗？他不是要把新四军“一网打尽”，并且下令解散新四军吗？蒋介石清楚地知道，要消灭共产党，首先就要消灭我党的革命武装。蒋介石为什么如此痛恨，又如此害怕共产党，根本的原因之一，就是因为我党掌握了革命武装。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”在第一次国内革命战争时期，党的组织是发展了，但是没有巩固，其中重要原因之一就是未能掌握住党的手里的一批革命武装。在第二次国内革命战争时期，党的组织重新发展了，并且得到了巩固，党取得了重大进步和成功，其重要原因之一，就是党创造了坚强的武装部队。在抗日战争中，党的组织从狭小的圈子中走了出来，变成了全国性的大党，其重要原因之一，也是党的武装力量重新壮大起来和进一步坚强起来。我们没有忘记这个拿血换来的经验。
    中国赫鲁晓夫妄图使我党接受国民党的领导，并交出党的军队，就是为了使我们党成为他所鼓吹的“合法的党”和进入“议会的党”。他要合的法就是国民党独裁政治的法，他要进的议会就是共产党以“文化团体”的资格进入资产阶级假民主的议会。在这里，他赤裸裸地暴露了蒋介石的应声虫的真面目。蒋介石早就说过，共产党要“合法地位”是可以的，其条件就是交出军队。这样，党不仅可以“合法”，以“文化团体”的资格进入“议会”，而且共产党员还可以到国民党政府里去做官。如果真的照此办理，那么，中国共产党就成为国民党的附庸，成为彻头彻尾的叛变革命的修正主义的党。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席针锋相对地痛加驳斥了国民党蒋介石的谬论，这同中国赫鲁晓夫形成了鲜明的对照。毛主席针对要我们党以所谓“文化团体”进入“议会”的说法，斩钉截铁地说：“我们不是‘文化团体’，我们有军队，是‘武化团体’。”针对要共产党交出军队才给予所谓“合法地位”的说法，气势磅礴地指出：“我们没有交出军队，所以没有合法地位，我们是‘无法无天’。”正因为我们沿着伟大舵手毛主席指引的航向前进，我们保持和扩大了“武化团体”，我们“无法无天”，才使我们党为中国人民的利益进行了卓有成效的斗争，得到了人民的拥护，才有抗战的胜利，才有新中国，才有社会主义，才有今天的伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党。
    无产阶级在夺取政权以后，党的中心任务仍然是搞阶级斗争，为实行无产阶级专政，巩固无产阶级专政而斗争。这是整个社会主义历史时期党的政治路线的根本问题。毛主席教导我们：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，必须坚持无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，才能防止资本主义复辟，进行社会主义建设，为过渡到共产主义准备条件。中国赫鲁晓夫竭力鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭”论，疯狂地反对无产阶级专政。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，在两条道路之间谁胜谁负问题尚未真正解决的时候，他胡说什么：“我国社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了”，“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，今后“党的主要任务就是尽快发展生产力”。这与赫鲁晓夫说的何其相似，简直毫无二致。赫鲁晓夫不也说“在社会主义条件下经济重于政治”，“党机关工作中主要的东西就是生产”，并把苏联党改造成“工业党”和“农业党”吗？事实上，中国赫鲁晓夫不甘落后，他大搞“专家”党，向资产阶级的所谓“专家”“高级知识分子”开门，把一些资产阶级学术“权威”和牛鬼蛇神拉入党内，以便达到他改变党的性质，复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    毛主席全面、系统、科学地阐明了社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，提出了无产阶级专政条件下革命的理论。毛主席指出：党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是资产阶级在党内的代表人物。他们是我们的最危险的敌人。中国赫鲁晓夫就是钻进党内的最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，终于把这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派揪出来了。广大革命群众奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，彻底揭露和批判了他几十年来贯彻执行资产阶级反动路线，进行反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，也彻底清算了他在党的建设方面推行的修正主义路线，剥开了他的所谓“建党权威”的画皮。经过这次无产阶级文化大革命，必将使我们的党更坚强、更健康，马克思列宁主义水平更高，必将为无产阶级党的建设开创一个新的纪元。
    毛主席为我们党制定的马克思列宁主义的政治路线，是我们党的建设的灵魂。毛主席的政治路线，引导我们党不断发展、巩固和进一步布尔塞维克化；党更加布尔塞维克化，党就能、党也才能更加正确地处理党的政治路线，领导革命事业从胜利走向胜利。中国赫鲁晓夫在党的建设上千条罪，万条罪，最大的罪，就在于他推行了一条修正主义的政治路线，妄图从根本上改变党的性质。我们要建设一个政治上成熟的伟大的马克思主义政党，千重要，万重要，最重要的就是要贯彻毛主席为我们党制定的政治路线。
    是无产阶级的先锋队，还是修正主义的“全民党”
    无产阶级政党是无产阶级组织的最高形式。中国赫鲁晓夫，同一切修正主义者一样，极力掩盖我们党的阶级性，篡改党的无产阶级先锋队的性质。他胡说什么党“要对群众负责”，“在党外还有很多优秀的人物，甚至还有很多好人，比我们共产党员还要好，但是没有进来”，因此，共产党要成为“群众的党”，“人民的党”，“好人”的党。人们一眼就可以看出，中国赫鲁晓夫的这些谬论，并不是什么新鲜玩艺，它和赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”理论完全是一路货，是彻头彻尾反马克思列宁主义、反毛泽东思想的修正主义货色。
    毛主席指出：“人民这个概念在不同的国家和各个国家的不同的历史时期，有着不同的内容。”就我国现阶段来说，人民的范围不仅包含工人阶级，而且还包含着农民阶级、城市小资产阶级和民族资产阶级。按照中国赫鲁晓夫的理论，我们的党岂不应该既是农民、小资产阶级的党，又是资产阶级的党了吗？
    按照中国赫鲁晓夫的说法，由于党“要对群众负责”，就应当成为“群众的党”，那么，共产党从来都是对群众负责的，那岂不本来就不应当是无产阶级政党，而应当是“群众的党”了吗？
    “好人”这个概念，在有阶级的社会里，是有鲜明的阶级性的。林副主席说过：“没有一个人不是属于某一个特定的阶级，总都是隶属于一定的社会关系，一定的阶级。”邓拓是一个无产阶级的叛徒，我们说他是个坏人，中国赫鲁晓夫站在反动立场上却说：“这个人对敌人忠实，对党也忠实。”事实就是这样清楚地告诉人们，好和坏、是和非、善和恶，不同的阶级从来就有截然不同的标准。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫大谈什么凌驾于一切阶级之上的超阶级的“人民的党”，“群众的党”，“好人”的党，纯粹是欺人之谈！
    事实上中国赫鲁晓夫搞的也不是什么“人民的党”、“群众的党”、“好人”的党。他在党的发展工作上长期以来对工农采取关门主义，而念念不忘的却是什么资本家“入了党则更好了”，什么“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”啦！又是什么“办自首手续”或填写“反共自愿书”的“得恢复其组织”，甚至“可以选为中央委员”啦！还有什么“抽大烟的”“当土匪的”“为什么不可以入党”啦！什么特务奸细“没有办法不让他混进一点来”啦！所有这些，就是中国赫鲁晓夫心目中的“人民”“群众”和“好人”。由这些人组成的党怎么能叫“人民的党”“群众的党”“好人”的党？这分明是一群乌七八糟的大杂烩！中国赫鲁晓夫煞有介事地贩卖赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”，其实，哪有什么真正的“全民”党？不是无产阶级先锋队，就是全资产阶级之“民”，全牛鬼蛇神之“民”。不管是赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”，还是中国赫鲁晓夫的“人民的党”、“群众的党”、“好人”的党，都只不过是修正主义党、法西斯党的代名词和遮羞布而已。
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了把这些社会渣滓拉进党内，还胡说什么这是“上了党规党法的”。这是彻头彻尾的胡说八道，是对我们党的极大污蔑。
    试问马列主义的党那有允许富农资本家入党的“党规党法”？如果那样，这个党岂不成了资产阶级的党，那还有什么共产主义可谈？
    试问马列主义的党那有允许叛变自首分子入党甚至担任中央委员的“党规党法”？如果那样，这个党岂不是成了搞“曲线救国”的汪精卫国民党？
    试问马列主义的党那有允许怀着各种个人动机的人入党的“党规党法”？如果那样，这个党岂不是成了施舍慈善的团体和追求个人目的的交易所？
    试问马列主义的党那有允许奸细、土匪、大烟鬼、宗教徒入党的“党规党法”？如果那样，这个党岂不成了黄金荣的青红帮？
    中国赫鲁晓夫心目中的“党规党法”是不折不扣的修正主义党、法西斯党的标本。
    共产党是无产阶级的先锋队，这样的党只能由对无产阶级历史使命具有无限忠心的先进分子来组成，这是关系到无产阶级政党性质的重大原则问题，也是国际共产主义运动的重要经验。我们伟大领袖毛主席一向强调：“我们是共产党，我们要领导人民打倒敌人，我们的队伍就要整齐，我们的步调就要一致，兵要精，武器要好。如果不具备这些条件，那末，敌人就不会被我们打倒。”列宁也强调指出：“我们的任务是要保护我们党的巩固性、坚定性和纯洁性。我们应当努力把党员的称号和作用提高，提高，再提高。”“徒有其名的党员，就是白给，我们也不要”。中国赫鲁晓夫妄图把社会上的牛鬼蛇神拉入党内，就是要把无产阶级的先锋队变成为资产阶级的大杂烩，以便为他实现篡党的阴谋、实现复辟资本主义的罪恶目的服务。如果不是由于毛主席的建党路线占居统治地位，如果不是这次无产阶级文化大革命把中国赫鲁晓夫揭露出来，那么，要不了多少年，我们的党势必也要蜕变为修正主义党、法西斯党。
    按无产阶级的世界观改造党，还是按资产阶级的世界观改造党
    用无产阶级世界观教育党员，指导党的全部活动和工作，始终是党的头等重要的任务。毛主席历来强调党的政治思想建设，强调用无产阶级世界观改造党员，促进党员思想革命化的极端重要性。毛主席着重从政治思想上建党的理论、方针，是对马克思列宁主义的一个伟大贡献，使我党一开始就建立在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上，成为一个政治上成熟的伟大的马克思主义政党。中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线，反映在党的思想建设上，就是以他的资产阶级世界观来改造党，与无产阶级世界观相对抗，与最高度、最集中代表无产阶级世界观的毛泽东思想相对抗。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的世界观既继承了伯恩斯坦、考茨基的修正主义，又掺杂了中国的土产“孔孟之道”，是资产阶级和封建士大夫的人生哲学相结合的杂种。他的世界观集中到一点就是一个“私”字，就是资产阶级的极端利己主义。他无耻地鼓吹：“占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜”，“这是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的”，狂妄叫嚣“不是大公无私，而是大公有私，公私兼顾，先公后私”。这就赤裸裸地暴露了他灵魂深处最肮脏最本质的东西：“先苦后甜”，“以利克利”，起点是个人，归宿还是个人，为“公”的目的是为私，总之是个人第一。这是他多年“悟”孔孟之“道”，“修”伯恩斯坦、考茨基之“行”的处世、处人、处己的人生哲学。他把革命作为投机的场所，把党作为“股份有限公司”，“公司赚了钱，股东就有份”。他的“公私溶化”论，是伯恩斯坦、考茨基的调和主义和折中主义的变种；他的“吃小亏，占大便宜”的谬论，是孔子的“小不忍，则乱大谋”，“见小利，则大事不成”的新解，归根到底，统统是假公济私的极端利己主义，是与毛主席的“大公无私”，“毫不利己专门利人”的无产阶级世界观根本对立的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的以“私”字为核心的资产阶级世界观，在不同的历史时期，给党带来最严重的危害的货色是：
    一曰活命哲学。在战争年代，在白色恐怖时期，每个党员如何正确处理生和死的矛盾，是反映什么样的世界观的集中表现。我们的革命前辈和先烈，“生的伟大，死的光荣。”为了革命的胜利，为了党的事业，在敌人的枪林弹雨下，出生入死，在敌人的屠刀下，英勇就义，壮烈牺牲，写下了多少可歌可泣的英雄史诗。而中国赫鲁晓夫却大唱反调，说什么一个共产党员要“钟爱自己，保护自己的生命与健康”，“党在可能条件下，……要放弃党的一些工作来保存同志”。看，这不是为火线上的逃兵，向敌人屈膝投降的叛徒唱赞歌吗？这与新老修正主义的所谓“好死不如赖活着”有什么区别？这与汉奸汪精卫的“曲线救国”有什么两样？他策动大批“共产党员”在狱中变节自首，就是在这一漂亮的言词下干出来的。中国赫鲁晓夫的一套“活命”谬论，是为他进行招降纳叛、结党营私所作的舆论准备。
    二曰“升官发财之道”。新中国成立之后，我们的党就成为执政党。我们的党员是为了做官还是为了革命，成为新的历史时期反映什么世界观的突出矛盾。毛主席教导我们，“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命”。而中国赫鲁晓夫反复宣扬的是孟子的“欲贵者，人之同心也。”把升官发财看作是人们的共同心理，并且以孟子的“人皆可以为尧舜”为号召，要人们为“向上爬”而奋斗终身。他甚至明目张胆地以“可以做官”为号召，要人们来“考”共产党员。说“过去是考秀才，现在是考共产党员”，“过去考上秀才就可以做官，现在加入了共产党也可以做官”。这不是鼓励人们设法混个“共产党员”的称号作为升官发财的敲门砖吗？如果真的照他那样去“考”，去接收党员，那末，我们的党就要蜕变成为那些政治野心家和其他各色各样的投机分子的俱乐部了。
    无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的斗争，归结到一点，是为公还是为私的斗争。在人们的头脑中，不是“公”字当权，就是“私”字专政。一公一私，此消彼长，非此即彼，是你死我活的阶级斗争。中国赫鲁晓夫如此疯狂地兜售封建主义、资本主义的黑货，为一些世界观未得到改造的资产阶级个人主义者提供“理论”根据，使那些争权夺利，沽名钓誉，以及钻进党内的个人野心家取得合法地位。这就使我们的党面临这样的危险：资产阶级个人主义就会在党内自由泛滥，原来一心要革命的共产党员也会套上那种腐朽没落的精神枷锁，去做名利场上角逐的牺牲品，成为他篡党篡政的驯服工具，最后使马克思列宁主义的党蜕变为修正主义的党、法西斯党。
    对于党的建设中所遇到的这一危险，毛主席早在抗日战争时期，就对妄图用资产阶级世界观改造我们党的人们提出严重的警告：“你们那一套是不行的，无产阶级是不能迁就你们的，依了你们，实际上就是依了大地主大资产阶级，就有亡党亡国的危险。只能依谁呢？只能依照无产阶级先锋队的面貌改造党，改造世界。”用无产阶级的世界观改造党，改造世界，也就是以战无不胜的毛泽东思想来改造党，改造世界。林彪同志一贯地把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得最高，他号召全国全军展开学习毛主席著作的群众运动，迅速在全党全国范围内掀起了一个群众性的学习毛主席著作的新高潮。广大的共产党员，同全国人民一道，进一步用毛泽东思想武装头脑，在三大革命运动中，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，为我党的革命化建设，作出了卓越的贡献。
    在当前无产阶级文化大革命进入新阶段，全党和全国无产阶级革命派以及广大革命人民，积极响应毛主席发出的要斗私，批修的伟大号召，誓把中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级世界观的破烂踢进历史的垃圾堆，保证按照无产阶级的世界观，按照战无不胜的毛泽东思想来建设我们的党。
    实行党的民主集中制，还是推行奴隶主义、无政府主义
    中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义的建党路线，还肆意践踏民主集中制这个党的根本组织原则，把党的民主集中制歪曲得面目全非。
    毛主席教导我们：“民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”我们的民主集中制，是在民主基础上的集中，集中指导下的民主。我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。中国赫鲁晓夫却胡说什么“党的领导人和上级机关应多注意民主；党的被领导者和下级机关应当多服从”。这就是说，在他的心目中，民主和集中，是依“上级”和“领导人”的个人意志为转移的，“集中”那是上级的特权，“民主”只不过是上级对下级的一种恩赐。民主和集中就这样成为他两样货色齐备，各有各的用处的反革命两手。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在他的修正主义面目被彻底揭露之前，一直打着党的集中、纪律的旗号，贩卖奴隶主义的黑货。民主也好，集中也好，在他看来只有一种解释，那就是“服从”！“绝对服从”！“不对也要服从”！党员必须成为他的“驯服的工具”。谁要是不听他的，就要挨棍子，戴帽子。他公开鼓吹以“上级和多数在原则上，在政治上先要正确”“为服从的条件”“是不对的”，“应该是无条件的、绝对的服从”，“如果中国党内发生了赫鲁晓夫政变，……多数意见是错误的，……也要‘少数服从多数’”，不这样，那就是“破坏党的统一”，就是“最大的犯罪”。这是一副多么凶神恶煞的面孔！说得明白一点，就是只许他篡党、叛党，不准许无产阶级革命派造他的反。这和无产阶级的民主集中制那有丝毫共同之处？
    马克思列宁主义党是讲集中的。但是这个集中是民主基础上的集中，在集中正确意见的基础上，统一思想，统一行动。如果按照中国赫鲁晓夫的主张，错误的也要服从，那么，民主集中制岂不成了中国赫鲁晓夫的个人独裁制？马列主义政党一贯反对那种单纯建立在“上级”观念上的盲目服从。毛主席指出：“共产党员对任何事情都要问一个为什么，都要经过自己头脑的周密思考，想一想它是否合乎实际，是否真有道理，绝对不应盲从，绝对不应提倡奴隶主义。”中国赫鲁晓夫口口声声说服从是无条件的绝对的，其实完全是自欺欺人的鬼话。如果说服从是无条件的，那么你为什么一贯反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线？如果说服从是绝对的，那么，你为什么不服从以毛主席为首的党中央的正确领导？说穿了，中国赫鲁晓夫的“服从”也是有条件的，那就是只能服从他的资产阶级反动路线，不能服从毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    无产阶级政党的服从是以政治上、原则上的正确为先决条件的。组织路线必须服从政治路线。要下级服从，首先“党的领导机关要有正确的指导路线”。这个正确的指导路线，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。这就是服从的先决条件。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决服从，坚决照办，违背毛泽东思想的，不管他是不是“多数”，也不管他是那一个“上级”，都坚决反对，绝不执行。毛主席教导我们：“危害革命的错误领导，不应当无条件接受，而应当坚决抵制”。抵制错误的领导，正是为了更好地服从以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导。
    所谓不服从错误的领导就是破坏“党的统一”，这完全是胡说八道。列宁指出：“统一，这是伟大的事业和伟大的口号！但是，工人事业所需要的是马克思主义者的统一，而不是马克思主义者同反对和歪曲马克思主义的人的统一。”我们的统一是有原则的；是在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的基础上的统一，是统一于以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，统一于毛主席的无产阶级的革命路线。服从中国赫鲁晓夫的领导，同中国赫鲁晓夫之流讲统一，就是对无产阶级革命事业的背叛。恩格斯说：“不要让‘团结’的叫喊把自己弄糊涂了。那些口头上喊这个口号喊得最多的人，恰好是煽动分裂的罪魁”。事实上破坏党的团结统一的不是别人，正是中国赫鲁晓夫。
    值得注意的是，中国赫鲁晓夫有时也会一反常态，以极“左”的面目出现，大谈其“党内民主”。他的“民主”，不是别的，就是“一概怀疑，一概打倒”的无政府主义。正是这个中国赫鲁晓夫到了一九六二年，却大谈特谈什么“发扬党内民主”，肆意诬蔑我们党缺乏民主生活，重犯了“过火斗争的错误”。还是这个中国赫鲁晓夫，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，在他的反动面目日益暴露，日子越来越不好混的时候，再也不提“少数服从多数”，而大谈其“保护少数”的高调，他要保护的“少数”，就是反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的党内一小撮走资派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神。他还极力鼓吹“一概怀疑，一概打倒”的无政府主义反动谬论，在干部问题上，疯狂地推行了“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线。
    一会儿右得惊人，心目中只有法西斯独裁，民主一钱不值；一会儿又“左”得出奇，民主高于一切，把集中、纪律抛至九霄云外。这种奇怪的现象，只能有一种解释，就是一切修正主义者都是实用主义的。只要对他有利，就是真理。所以在他掌权的时候，就用奴隶主义维护他的统治，在他面临破产的时候就抛出无政府主义，企图搅乱革命阵线，好让他溜之大吉。但是同中国赫鲁晓夫的愿望相反，“左”的和右的两手，都没有能挽救他失败的命运。可以断言，他的徒子徒孙步他的后尘，也绝不会有更好的下场！
    毛主席教导我们说：“要党有力量，依靠实行党的民主集中制去发动全党的积极性。”只有实行民主集中制，才能团结全党，胜利地实现党在各个时期的任务。中国赫鲁晓夫肆意歪曲党的民主集中制，正是要使我们党丧失革命性、丧失战斗力，以便于他达到篡党的阴险目的。但是，在以毛主席为首的党中央的领导下，我们党仍将坚定不移地贯彻无产阶级的民主集中制，使我们党和国家“造成一个又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼，那样一种政治局面”。让中国赫鲁晓夫的奴隶主义和无政府主义见鬼去吧！

    “一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”我们党的历史就是两条路线的斗争史，是毛主席的革命路线的胜利发展史。在我们党内揭露并揪出以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，摧毁了隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的建党路线的伟大胜利。我们的党更坚强了，更富有生命力了，党的马列主义水平更高了。我们党敢于领导和发动这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，更加证明了我们的党不愧是毛主席亲自缔造和培育的伟大的、光荣的、正确的党。
    中国赫鲁晓夫虽然已经被我们拉下马、靠边站，但他的资产阶级反动路线，他的资产阶级世界观的“尸体”，还在我们身边发霉，继续毒害我们的灵魂。因此，摆在我们面前的根本任务，是在毛主席的要斗私，批修的伟大方针指引下，巩固革命的大联合，进一步深入开展革命的大批判，搞好本单位的斗批改，把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清其流毒，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，彻底改造世界观。否则，就不能挖掉修正主义根子，达不到无产阶级文化大革命的根本目的。
    世界已进入毛泽东思想的新时代，毛主席和中国共产党已经成为世界革命的灯塔。进一步巩固、发展和壮大我们的党，这是中国人民的希望，也是世界革命人民的希望。只要我们坚定地沿着毛主席指引的政治方向，用毛泽东思想来建设我们的党，我们一定能达到目的，一定能完成历史赋予我们的伟大使命，一定不辜负中国人民和世界革命人民对我们的期望。
    用毛泽东思想建设党，是唯一正确的道路。这不论在中国，在外国，一概都是对的。全世界革命的共产党人和广大革命人民，必将团结在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，涤荡赫鲁晓夫修正主义的污泥浊水，为创造一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界而奋斗。
