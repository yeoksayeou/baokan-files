A few years ago, when our country faced temporary economic difficulties, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, in collusion with the Chinese Khrushchev, vigorously advocated "three autonomies and one contract." He shouted, "Now the agricultural problem must be solved from the perspective of production relations. Now, throughout the country, there are commune ownership, brigade ownership, team ownership, and Anhui's responsibility fields, which are actually dividing land to households... Whatever form is suitable for restoring and developing production in a particular place, that form should be adopted. The masses should adopt whatever form they are willing to adopt, making what is illegal legal." He vigorously advocated making the illegal "dividing land to households" legal, fully exposing his ugly face of conspiring to restore capitalism.

Who opposes dividing land to households, and who supports it; who says this is illegal, and who says this is legal. I have personal experience.

My hometown is in Anhui. At that time, a wave of dividing land to households and individual farming swept through my hometown. Landlords and rich peasants were overjoyed, saying, "Collective, collective, the more it is done, the more it fails. Individual, individual, the more it is done, the more it succeeds." "Now it's good, dividing land to households is legal." After dividing land to households, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, military dependents, families of martyrs, and "five guarantees" households, who had few laborers and incomplete farming tools, could not farm all the land. They worked hard all year but still had to compensate for the production, lacked grain, and almost every family had to overspend tens of yuan. For example, my uncle's family is poor peasants. They have many children and few laborers. Not only did they face grain shortages, but they also overspent more than one hundred yuan. However, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements took advantage of the situation to engage in "private plots" and "ten edges fields," using the method of nibbling to encroach on collective land, undermining the foundation of socialism. Corruption, theft, speculation, and usury all appeared. Just over a year of dividing land to households, my hometown became poor and rich, helping and hiring, and the phenomenon of increasingly serious polarization appeared, resulting in agricultural production being the worst in any year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants indignantly said, "In the past, we practiced collectivization, and production was better year by year, our contributions to the state were greater year by year, and our lives were better year by year. Now, who does not want us to practice collectivization? Who wants to drag us down the capitalist road?" "Dividing land to households is illegal, and we firmly oppose this!"

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party wants to "restore and develop" capitalism. The "masses" he refers to are landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. The "legal" he refers to is to make the "law" of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements "legal," and to make the "law" of capitalism "legal." He wants to use the pretext of "legal" to mobilize demons and monsters to dig at the foundation of socialism and to support them to undermine our socialist collective economy. Therefore, the essence of his "legal" theory is to restore capitalism in China. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "Only socialism can save China." This is a great truth. Take my hometown as an example. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the broad revolutionary masses and cadres in my hometown rebelled against the "dividing land to households," and the collective economy was consolidated and developed. People's enthusiasm was mobilized, and production was better year by year. In the past two years, the community members, relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the boundless power of the collective, overcame the rare drought and achieved a bumper harvest in agriculture. The lives of the community members are getting better and better. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants deeply felt: "Individual farming is a narrow bridge, collectivization is the broad road." This is their resounding response to the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's conspiracy to restore capitalism!

    分田到户合哪个阶级的“法”
    六五○四部队五好战士　罗齐富
    几年前，在我国遇到暂时经济困难的时候，党内另一个最大的走资派，同中国赫鲁晓夫狼狈为奸，大肆鼓吹“三自一包”。他狂叫：“现在农业问题要从生产关系上来解决，现在全国有公社所有制，大队所有制，生产队所有制，还有安徽的责任田，实际上是分田到户……哪种形式哪种地方比较容易恢复和发展生产，就来用哪种形式，群众愿意采用哪种就采用哪种，使不合法的变成合法的”。他极力鼓吹要把不合法的“分田到户”变成“合法”，这充分暴露了他阴谋复辟资本主义的丑恶嘴脸。
    谁反对分田到户，谁拥护分田到户；谁说这样做不合法，谁说这样做合法。我有亲身感受。
    我的家在安徽。那时候，家乡曾刮起分田到户的单干风。地主富农得意忘形地说：“集体集体，越搞越生气，单干单干，越干越有指望。”“现在好了，分田到户合法了。”分田到户以后，广大贫下中农、军属、烈属、“五保户”，家里劳力少，农具又不齐，田种不过来。一年累到头，还要赔产，口粮不够，几乎家家都要超支好几十元。例如，我叔叔家是贫农，家里小孩多，劳力少，不仅口粮发生困难，还超支一百多元。可是，地富反坏分子大搞“自留地”“十边田”，用蚕食的办法侵占集体土地，挖社会主义墙脚。贪污盗窃，投机倒把，放高利贷等歪风都出现了。仅仅一年多的分田到户，就弄得我们家乡穷的穷，富的富，帮的帮，雇的雇，出现了日益严重的两极分化的现象，造成了农业生产比以往任何一年都差的恶果。广大贫下中农纷纷气愤地说：“以前我们搞集体化，生产一年比一年好，对国家的贡献一年比一年大，生活一年比一年高。现在是谁不要我们搞集体化？要把我们往资本主义路上拉？”“分田到户不合法，这样搞下去我们坚决不同意！”
    党内另一个最大的走资本主义道路当权派所要“恢复和发展”的正是资本主义，他所说的“群众”，就是地、富、反、坏分子，他所说的“合法”，正是“合”的地富反坏分子的“法”，“合”资本主义的“法”。他妄想在“合法”的幌子下，动员牛鬼蛇神起来大挖社会主义墙脚，并为他们撑腰，来搞垮我们社会主义集体经济。所以他的“合法”论的要害，就是要在中国复辟资本主义。我们伟大领袖毛主席早就明确地指出：“只有社会主义能够救中国”。这是一个伟大的真理。还拿我家乡为例。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，我家乡广大革命群众和革命干部造了“分田到户”的反，集体经济巩固发展了，人的积极因素调动起来了，生产一年比一年好。近两年来，社员们依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，依靠集体的无穷威力，战胜了罕见的干旱，取得了农业大丰收，社员的生活越来越好。广大贫下中农深有感触地说：“单干是独木桥，集体化是阳关道。”这就是他们对党内另一个最大的走资派复辟资本主义的阴谋的响亮的回答！
