Comrade Yao Wenyuan's important article "On the Counter-Revolutionary Two-Faced Character of Zhou Yang," published in January this year, in analyzing Zhou Yang's evil plot to promote the "Hai Rui Spirit," pointed out: "Zhou Yang repeatedly promotes the 'Hai Rui Spirit' to organize a major offensive, directing the spearhead at the Party Central Committee, to rehabilitate the right-opportunists. In 1962, the main leaders of the old Propaganda Department again advocated learning from Wei Zheng. They had one 'Hai Rui Spirit' and one 'Wei Zheng Spirit,' finding a common language for counter-revolutionaries." Comrade Yao Wenyuan here refers to the main leader of the old Propaganda Department who promoted the "Wei Zheng Spirit," who is the king of the underworld in the old Propaganda Department, Lu Dingyi.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi harbors deep hatred for our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. According to the political needs of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev, he spared no effort to create counter-revolutionary public opinion to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, attempting to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, take the stage to restore capitalism in China. The "Biography of Wei Zheng" fabricated by Lu Dingyi is a poisonous weed that promotes the "Wei Zheng Spirit" and fiercely opposes our great leader Chairman Mao.

The Publication of "The Biography of Wei Zheng" is a Major Political Conspiracy

"The Biography of Wei Zheng" was hastily fabricated by Lu Dingyi in 1962. During the fabrication process, Lu Dingyi had his confidants find the "Old Book of Tang" and "New Book of Tang" containing the biography of Wei Zheng for him to read. After reading, he ordered the immediate organization of specialized forces to annotate and publish it, and dispatched the director of the old Propaganda Department's publishing office to supervise the publishing unit. He also sent people to repeatedly call to inquire and personally instructed the writing of the preface and personally reviewed the manuscript. By adopting the method of translating and editing simultaneously, typesetting and proofreading simultaneously, and working overtime to print, this poisonous weed was released in just over half a month.

To publish a biography of a historical figure, such a "big shot" as Lu Dingyi personally directed and was so mobilized and urgent, was indeed extraordinary. What was this for? It was to closely cooperate with the counter-revolutionary restoration activities of the handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party at that time.

From 1960 to 1962, the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in our country was at a critical juncture. A small handful of capitalism-roaders within the Party and all the ghosts and monsters stirred up various evil winds such as the "individual farming wind" and the "rehabilitation wind." The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party, and various reactionaries performed a boisterous anti-China chorus. The Kuomintang bandits also stirred, attempting to invade the mainland. In 1962, at the enlarged Central Work Conference of our Party, the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev engaged in fierce struggle. Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and vigorously promoted the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought at the meeting. However, the Chinese Khrushchev launched a frenzied attack on Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought at the meeting. He crazily shouted, "Opposing Chairman Mao is only opposing an individual." He also advocated, "There should be opposition, whether among the people or within the Party, there should be open opposition." Lu Dingyi, the "commander" of the bourgeois headquarters on the ideological front, immediately jumped out to respond. He brought out the political corpse of Wei Zheng from over a thousand years ago as a specimen and also shouted loudly, "Even ancient emperors allowed opposition. Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty had a Wei Zheng, who was specifically opposed to him."

After the meeting, the Chinese Khrushchev rallied his counter-revolutionary followers with tenfold frenzy, accelerating their counter-revolutionary restoration conspiracy activities, and creating a clamor to seize the Party and the country. The Chinese Khrushchev hurriedly fabricated his own revisionist masterpiece "Cultivation" (revised edition) as a black program to oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat and restore capitalism. The counter-revolutionary revisionist, the big warlord Peng Zhen, vigorously spread the counter-revolutionary fallacy that the great leader Chairman Mao should "step down." The "Three Families Village" and "Four Stores" threw out more poisonous weeds such as "Liu Zhidan" and "Defending Liu Sanchui," and the press and stage continuously appeared with propaganda for the "Hai Rui Spirit." The American imperialists also shouted, hoping for the emergence of "new elements" in China, "promoting the liberalization of this government." The class enemies at home and abroad, like hungry wolves with red eyes, eagerly awaited the Chinese Khrushchev to take the stage. The "Biography of Wei Zheng" fabricated by Lu Dingyi was released under this class struggle background. It is a part of the entire counter-revolutionary conspiracy activities led by the Chinese Khrushchev and the bourgeois headquarters.

After the publication of "The Biography of Wei Zheng," Lu Dingyi promoted it widely within and outside the Party. He ordered the staff of the old Propaganda Department to have a copy each, organize study, and distribute and recommend it at the propaganda department heads' meetings he convened in various regions. This book was mass-reproduced in some regions. Some newspapers also published articles praising Wei Zheng. Some schools even used it as a textbook. In the old Beijing Municipal Committee and other departments, some people even fabricated scripts such as "Emperor Taizong of Tang," "Luoyang Palace," and "Tang Emperor Accepts Criticism," intending to bring Wei Zheng to the stage. For a time, a wind of promoting the "Wei Zheng Spirit" blew.

Chairman Mao said, "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this."

Now it is clear that the "Biography of Wei Zheng" fabricated by Lu Dingyi is another poisonous arrow shot at our most red, most red sun, Chairman Mao, following "Hai Rui's Memorial to the Emperor," "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," and "Hai Rui's Dismissal." It is another declaration of inciting counter-revolutionary restoration.

The Malicious Intent Behind Promoting the "Wei Zheng Spirit"

The "Hai Rui Spirit" emphasizes "scolding," while the "Wei Zheng Spirit" emphasizes "opposition." "The Biography of Wei Zheng" vigorously describes how Wei Zheng dared to be the emperor's opposition. The preface (draft) of the biography vividly says, "Wei Zheng, a famous politician of the early Tang Dynasty, was a person who dared to offend the emperor and speak frankly." The text also vigorously praises and describes how Wei Zheng "had the spirit, had the courage, dared to offend, and advised the emperor," how he was "firm and upright," and "fierce and straightforward." Lu Dingyi himself also promoted in many occasions, saying, "Wei Zheng was the enemy of Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty, giving advice very sharply," "the opposition speaks, and it doesn't sound good, not something like wise leadership, but wearing a hat and beating a stick." He even maliciously incited at a meeting, saying, "Wei Zheng of the Tang Dynasty should still be promoted... why aren't we like Wei Zheng?"

Was Wei Zheng really the "opposition" and "enemy" of Emperor Taizong? No. Wei Zheng and Emperor Taizong were both cruel exploiters and oppressors of the peasants in the feudal ruling class. Wei Zheng was just a loyal servant of Emperor Taizong. Wei Zheng's "loyal advice" was "loyal" to the feudal ruling class of the Tang Dynasty. The titles such as "Wei Zheng is the 'opposition' and 'enemy' of Emperor Taizong" are all titles given to Wei Zheng by Lu Dingyi.

Then, why did Lu Dingyi arbitrarily distort history, use the method of criticizing the present through the past, and promote the need for an opposition like Wei Zheng within the Party? What kind of goods is this opposition?

Chairman Mao pointed out acutely, "The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and change the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."

The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi are precisely the kind of people pointed out by Chairman Mao. They have long been hidden within the Communist Party and the organs of the dictatorship of the proletariat, lurking around Chairman Mao. They formed a counter-revolutionary revisionist group, organized and planned to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. In front of imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, they are servile and loyal, faithfully following the line of national and class capitulation; but towards Chairman Mao, the great leader loved and revered by the people of the whole country and the world, they are full of rebellion, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Lu Dingyi, standing on the counter-revolutionary position, gnashed his teeth and said, "Every volume of middle school language textbooks starts with an article by Chairman Mao... it's really servile!" The counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang revealed his ferocious appearance, saying, "We want to cultivate the spirit of Hai Rui's memorial... it's really annoying to always refer to Mao Zedong Thought." These black words thoroughly exposed their wild ambition to fiercely oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. In their eyes, whoever respects and reveres the greatest Marxist-Leninist of the world, Chairman Mao, and actively learns, propagates, executes, and defends the highest truth of the proletariat tested by time—Mao Zedong Thought, is "servile"; conversely, whoever fiercely opposes Chairman Mao and stubbornly opposes Mao Zedong Thought is "firm and upright." It's really reactionary to the extreme!

Obviously, the "Wei Zheng Spirit" promoted by Lu Dingyi is the counter-revolutionary spirit of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought; the opposition like Wei Zheng he promoted is the counter-revolutionary faction that attempts to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. The reason Lu Dingyi hastily threw out "The Biography of Wei Zheng" and raised the black flag of "opposition like Wei Zheng" in 1962 was that he thought the time for them to seize the Party and the country was approaching, and they had to quickly create counter-revolutionary public opinion for the criminal activities of the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, so that their counter-revolutionary revisionist group could more brazenly carry out the conspiracy to seize the Party and the country. This was also to disguise themselves as "Wei Zheng"-style "concerned for the country and the people" and "loyal and upright" figures by wearing the clothes of ancient people, to deceive the people. They also wanted to use this to further incite, rally, and cover up all the ghosts and monsters within and outside the Party to attack Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought from all sides, to achieve an internal and external joint attack. In a word, this is to create public opinion to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and restore capitalism in our country.

History has repeatedly proven that when Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought occupy a dominant position within the Party, whoever tries to create an opposition within the Party completely goes against the interests of the Party and the will of all revolutionary masses, and that is a counter-revolutionary faction, regardless of what name or trick is used, they will eventually be defeated.

Today, the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has already solemnly pronounced the political death sentence on the counter-revolutionary faction within the Party—the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev.

Using Emperor Taizong of Tang to Shadow and Attack Our Great Leader Chairman Mao

As early as May 1957, when the right-wing bourgeoisie was fiercely attacking the Party at its peak, just before our Party's counterattack against the right-wing, Lu Dingyi had already maliciously shadowed and attacked our great leader Chairman Mao at the meeting of the staff of the old Propaganda Department. In 1962, Lu Dingyi used "The Biography of Wei Zheng" to use the method of hinting and attacking, through Wei Zheng criticizing Emperor Taizong's "success" and not humbly "accepting criticism," to shadow and attack our great leader Chairman Mao, saying nonsense such as "only believing one side's words" and "suppressing the spread of truth," etc. At the enlarged Central Work Conference of the Party, when he promoted the "Wei Zheng Spirit," he also fiercely attacked Chairman Mao and our Party, saying, "Do not follow the mass line, only follow the class line," "The Party has no mass line, it's like the Kuomintang, in name it's the Communist Party, but in reality it's the Kuomintang, ruling the country with one party, one leader, one ideology, and one government." This is a bunch of extremely reactionary and absurd nonsense.

Chairman Mao is the greatest and most modest, a shining example of adhering to the mass line, and a shining example of adhering to democratic centralism. As Comrade Lin Biao said, "Chairman Mao is the most outstanding leader of the proletariat in contemporary times, the greatest genius. Chairman Mao believes in the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movement of the masses the most, and is heart to heart with the revolutionary masses!" It is precisely Lu Dingyi and his backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, who have long been arrogant and tyrannical, practiced a one-man show, and implemented bourgeois dictatorship, and are the great demons who suppress the revolution.

Lu Dingyi attacked, saying, "Do not follow the mass line, only follow the class line." I ask, in a society with classes, the masses are divided into classes. If the class line is removed and the class perspective is removed, what abstract mass line is there? Lu Dingyi once bluntly said, "Escaped landlords should also be united," and "including prisoners in jail" are also "objects of literary service." The masses in the minds of Lu Dingyi and his ilk are anti-Party elements, traitors, counter-revolutionary revisionists, and landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Deprive the reactionaries of their right to speak, and let the people have the right to speak." For class enemies, for those who claim to be "contemporary Wei Zhengs" like Lu Dingyi and his ilk, we must "reject" their "advice" and seize their power! If we follow them, the Party and the country will perish, China will regress greatly, and the world revolution will suffer a serious setback.

Lu Dingyi attacked Chairman Mao and our Party for "ruling the country with the Party." This is a piece of wisdom picked up from the right-wing bourgeoisie.

Any class rules the country through its own party to implement the dictatorship of its own class. The proletariat is precisely through the leadership of its own party—the Communist Party to implement revolutionary dictatorship. Lu Dingyi and his ilk shout against "ruling the country with the Party," which is nothing but opposing the Communist Party that implements Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to "rule" the socialist "country," and wanting to use the revisionist party to "rule" the "country" that has restored capitalism.

Lu Dingyi and his ilk shout to the death against "one party, one leader, one ideology, and one government." This is their self-incrimination of attempting to overthrow the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao and seize the Party and the country.

They intend to raise the counter-revolutionary revisionist leader, the Chinese Khrushchev, under the banner of opposing "one leader" to replace the greatest Marxist-Leninist of contemporary times, our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao; they intend to bring out a set of revisionist goods under the banner of opposing "one ideology" to replace the great Mao Zedong Thought, making our Party and country degenerate and change color.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical basis guiding our thoughts is Marxism-Leninism." To consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and consolidate and develop the socialist system, we must resolutely support the leadership of the Communist Party of China armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought; we must have the greatest loyalty and love for our country's people and the people of the world's great leader and great teacher, Chairman Mao; we must have an unlimited faith in the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of contemporary times—Mao Zedong Thought. The sea can dry up, and the stones can rot, but the red heart loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will never change!

Lu Dingyi also used "The Biography of Wei Zheng" to repeat the reactionary tune of "Hai Rui's Dismissal," to plead for the great conspirator, great schemer, and great warlord Peng Dehuai and all the right-opportunists, to reverse the verdict and counterattack.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "A person, a party, an army, or a school, if not opposed by the enemy, that would be bad, that would mean we have merged with the enemy. If opposed by the enemy, that would be good, that would mean we have drawn a clear line with the enemy. If the enemy vigorously opposes us, slanders us to the extreme, and says we are utterly worthless, that would be even better, that would mean not only have we drawn a clear line with the enemy, but it would also mean our work has achieved great success."

The old counter-revolutionary Lu Dingyi's vicious slander and defamation of Chairman Mao do not harm Chairman Mao's sublime and glorious image but only prove Chairman Mao's wisdom, greatness, and correctness.

Attempting to Overthrow the Dictatorship of the Proletariat

After the Khrushchev revisionist traitor group restored capitalism in the first socialist state built by Lenin, Chairman Mao repeatedly warned the whole Party to learn from the lessons of the Soviet Union and prevent the restoration of capitalism in our country. In 1962, Chairman Mao again sounded the alarm at the enlarged Central Work Conference of the Party. However, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Lu Dingyi, soon after the meeting, through "The Biography of Wei Zheng," maliciously proposed the slogan "Learn from the fall of the Sui Dynasty" to sing the opposite of Chairman Mao's teachings.

Chairman Mao teaches us to learn from the lessons of Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, which is to make the whole Party adhere to the revolutionary principles of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the dictatorship of the proletariat, and adhere to the general line of socialist revolution and socialist construction. What kind of goods is the so-called "Learn from the fall of the Sui Dynasty" advocated by Lu Dingyi?

In the preface (draft) of "The Biography of Wei Zheng," Lu Dingyi said that Wei Zheng "often advised Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty to learn from the already fallen Sui Dynasty," "save manpower and resources, and stop all non-urgent tasks." He also said through the mouth of Wei Zheng in "The Biography of Wei Zheng," "The Sui Dynasty was strong and prosperous but perished because it disturbed the people," "continuously waged war, endlessly conscripted the people for labor service," "mobilized the masses," "arbitrarily built," "arbitrarily moved earth and stone," making the people "exhausted and unable to live." He even maliciously incited, saying, "Disturbing the people leads to great chaos."

In May 1962, Lu Dingyi even said at a meeting, borrowing Wei Zheng's criticism of Emperor Taizong, "Do not wage war, do not kill, do not be extravagant, do not mobilize too many labor services, be stable and it will be peaceful, be active and it will be chaotic." He also took the opportunity to say, "We are not mobilizing too many labor services!"

What is the meaning of these black words? Is it not clear?

In 1958, based on the objective laws of the development of socialist society and the strong desire of the broad masses of the people across the country to change the poor and backward face and build socialism, Chairman Mao put forward the three red banners of the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Under the guidance of these three red banners, the revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity of hundreds of millions of people burst forth like atomic energy, and a hot and revolutionary scene and a leaping-forward situation appeared on all fronts. Chairman Mao enthusiastically praised, "Never before have we seen the people so spirited, full of fighting spirit, and full of vigor." The Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi, these representatives of the bourgeoisie within the Party, however, hated the three red banners to the core and fiercely attacked them.

The curses of "disturbing the people," "not cherishing the people's strength," "building too much will collapse," etc., from the mouth of Wei Zheng, are not these vicious attacks on the three red banners? Are they not to make us abandon the socialist revolution, abandon socialist construction, and abandon the revolutionary mass movement? It should also be pointed out that the Chinese Khrushchev, in attacking the three red banners in May 1961, had already maliciously said, "Know that Qin Shihuang built the Great Wall and the Sui Emperor built the Grand Canal and collapsed." The head of the bourgeois headquarters set the topic and tone, and Lu Dingyi wrote a big article and created public opinion.

"Do not wage war," "do not use troops," "do not kill," what is the difference between this and the "peace gospel" chanted by Khrushchev of the Soviet Union? Is this not opposing revolutionary war? In the situation where imperialism and other class enemies still exist, can we "put away our swords and spears"? Lu Dingyi and his ilk, dressed in the guise of a Buddha, shouting "do not use troops," "do not kill," are precisely trying to lull our revolutionary will to sleep, so that they can seize the Party, the government, and the army. If their conspiracy succeeds, who knows how many heads will roll!

The six words "be stable and it will be peaceful, be active and it will be chaotic" shouted by Wei Zheng's mouth, concentrate the hatred and fear of the exploiting class and their agents towards the earth-shaking socialist revolution, reflecting their desire to maintain and restore the old system. They want to bind the hands and feet of the revolutionary people, so that they can more brazenly carry out counter-revolutionary activities.

The fabricator of "The Biography of Wei Zheng," in order to achieve his unspoken political purpose, also distorted the original meaning of the sentence "A person without trust cannot stand" in the "New Book of Tang" version of "The Biography of Wei Zheng" into such plain language: "The people have no confidence in the government, and the country cannot stand." He used this to slander that our political situation seems precarious, inciting ghosts and monsters to attack more brazenly.

Lu Dingyi also shouted through "The Biography of Wei Zheng," "Sage people take the opportunity to rise up and save the people from the danger of destruction." This is a signal! It shows that the Chinese Khrushchev and the likes of Lu Dingyi have crowned themselves as "sage people," wanting to "take the opportunity to rise up" and carry out a counter-revolutionary coup.

In short, the set of things promoted by Lu Dingyi through "The Biography of Wei Zheng" is to cooperate with the class enemies at home and abroad, oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, oppose Chairman Mao's correct leadership, and attempt to make the ship of New China deviate from the socialist course indicated by Chairman Mao and go back on its tracks.

Marx has a famous saying, which is very appropriate to describe the fabricators of "The Biography of Wei Zheng": "They tremble and summon the spirits to help them, borrowing their names, battle cries, and clothes, to perform a new scene of world history in these long-respected costumes, using this borrowed language."

The spirit summoned by Lu Dingyi and his ilk is one of the feudal slaves, Wei Zheng. The "new scene" they want to perform is the attempt to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat led by Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, and restore capitalism. However, the development of objective things is always contrary to the wishes of the reactionaries. Whoever opposes the great Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought will be overthrown by the people. The "spirits" summoned by Lu Dingyi and his ilk did not help them. The "new scene" performed by this small group of counter-revolutionary clowns only accelerated their own doom.

    从《魏征传》的出笼看陆定一的反革命嘴脸
    钟宣造
    姚文元同志今年一月发表的《评反革命两面派周扬》的重要文章，在剖析周扬鼓吹“海瑞精神”的罪恶阴谋时，指出：“周扬一再鼓吹‘海瑞精神’，是为了组织一场大进攻，把矛头指向党中央，为右倾机会主义分子翻案。一九六二年，旧中宣部主要领导人又一次提倡要学习魏征，他们一个‘海瑞精神’，一个‘魏征精神’，找到了反革命的共同语言。”姚文元同志在这里所指的鼓吹“魏征精神”的旧中宣部主要领导人，就是旧中宣部阎王殿大阎王陆定一。
    反革命修正主义分子陆定一，对我们伟大的领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想怀着刻骨的仇恨。他根据以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的政治需要，千方百计地制造反革命的舆论，来反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，妄图颠覆以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，颠覆无产阶级专政，让他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫登台，在中国实现资本主义复辟。陆定一炮制的《魏征传》，就是鼓吹“魏征精神”，猖狂反对伟大领袖毛主席的一株大毒草。
    《魏征传》的出笼是一个大政治阴谋
    《魏征传》是陆定一在一九六二年急如星火地炮制出来的。在炮制过程中，陆定一要他的心腹找了载有魏征传记的《旧唐书》和《新唐书》给他看，看后下令立即组织专门力量译注和出版，并指派旧中宣部出版处长到出版单位坐催。他还派人不断打电话催问，并亲自授意写前言，亲自审稿。由于采取了边译边改，边排边校，加班赶印的突击方法，只用了半个多月的时间，这株大毒草就出笼了。
    为了出版一本历史人物的传记，陆定一这样的“大人物”竟亲自指挥，又如此兴师动众、十万火急，确实是异乎寻常的。这到底是为了什么呢？他是为了紧密配合当时党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行的反革命复辟活动。
    一九六零年到一九六二年，我国两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争处于紧要关头。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神刮起了“单干风”、“翻案风”等种种妖风。以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派，演出了嚣张一时的反华大合唱。蒋介石匪帮也蠢蠢欲动，妄图窜犯大陆。一九六二年，在我党召开的扩大的中央工作会议上，以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部，展开了激烈的搏斗。毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在会上大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威。而中国赫鲁晓夫却在会上向毛主席和毛泽东思想发动猖狂的攻击。他疯狂地叫嚷：“反对毛主席，只是反对个人。”他还鼓吹“要有反对派，人民中间也好，党内也好，要有公开的反对派”。陆定一，这个资产阶级司令部在思想战线上的“指挥官”，马上跳出来呼应。他搬出魏征这具一千三百多年前的政治僵尸来做标本，也大肆叫嚣：“古时皇帝还允许反对派，唐太宗有一个魏征，就是专门同他做对立面的。”
    会后，中国赫鲁晓夫纠集他的反革命党羽，以十倍的疯狂，加紧进行反革命复辟的阴谋活动，密锣紧鼓地大造篡党篡国的舆论。中国赫鲁晓夫加紧炮制他自己的修正主义代表作《修养》（再版），作为反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的黑纲领。反革命修正主义分子、大党阀彭真，极力散布要伟大领袖毛主席“下台”的反革命谬论。“三家村”、“四家店”抛出更多的大毒草如《刘志丹》、《为李三才辩护》等等，报刊和舞台上不断地出现对“海瑞精神”的宣传。美帝国主义者也叫嚷期待“中国出现新分子”，“促进这个政权内部的自由主义化”。国内外的阶级敌人，象饿狼熬红了眼一样，眼巴巴地等待中国赫鲁晓夫上台。陆定一炮制的《魏征传》，正是在这种阶级斗争背景下出笼的。这是以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部整个反革命阴谋活动的一个组成部分。
    《魏征传》出笼以后，陆定一在党内党外广为推销。他要旧中宣部的工作人员人手一册，组织学习，并在他召开的各地区宣传部长会议上散发和推荐。这本书在有的地区被大量翻印。有些报刊也发表了宣扬魏征的文章。有的学校还把它作为教材。在旧北京市委等部门，有人还炮制了《唐太宗》、《洛阳宫》、《唐皇纳谏》等剧本，打算把魏征搬上舞台。一时，刮起了一股鼓吹“魏征精神”的妖风。
    毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”
    现在看得很清楚，陆定一炮制的《魏征传》，是继《海瑞上疏》、《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等之后射向我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的又一支大毒箭，是又一篇煽动反革命复辟的宣言书。
      鼓吹“魏征精神”的险恶用心
    “海瑞精神”突出一个“骂”字，“魏征精神”则突出一个“反”字。《魏征传》极力渲染魏征如何敢于充当皇帝的反对派。传记的前言（初稿）中画龙点睛地说：“魏征，唐初著名的政治家，是一位不怕冒犯皇帝，敢于直言极谏的人物。”文里也大肆吹捧和描绘魏征如何“有志气，有肝胆，能够不怕冒犯，向太宗进谏”，如何“坚强正直”，“激烈直率”。陆定一自己还在许多场合鼓吹说：“魏征是唐太宗的死对头，提意见很尖锐”，“反对派讲话，听起来味道是不那么好的，不是什么英明领导之类，而是戴点帽子，打点棍子”。他甚至在一次会议上恶毒地煽动说：“唐朝的魏征还是应该提倡……我们为什么不如魏征？”
    魏征果真是唐太宗的“反对派”、“死对头”吗？不是。魏征和唐太宗都是残酷地剥削和压迫农民的封建统治者。魏征只不过是唐太宗的一个忠实的大奴才。魏征的“忠言”，是“忠”于唐朝封建统治阶级之“言”。所谓魏征是唐太宗的“反对派”、“死对头”这一类称号，都是陆定一给魏征加封的。
    那么，陆定一为什么要恣意歪曲历史，玩弄借古讽今的手法，来鼓吹党内要有魏征那样的反对派呢？这种反对派又是一种什么货色呢？
    毛主席一针见血地指出：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，正是毛主席所指出的这种人。他们长期暗藏在共产党和无产阶级专政机构的内部，潜伏在毛主席的身边。他们结成一个反革命修正主义集团，有组织有计划地进行颠覆以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、颠覆无产阶级专政的阴谋活动。他们在帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派面前是奴颜媚骨，忠实地奉行民族投降主义和阶级投降主义路线；而对待全国和全世界人民无限热爱无限崇拜的伟大导师毛主席，却是一身反骨，疯狂地对抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。陆定一站在反革命的立场上咬牙格格地说过：“中学语文教材中每册开头都是毛主席的文章……，真是卑躬屈膝！”反革命修正主义分子周扬凶相毕露地说：“我们要培养海瑞上本的精神……言必称毛泽东思想，也是够令人恼火的就是了。”这些黑话彻底暴露了他们猖狂反对毛主席和毛泽东思想的狼子野心。在他们看来，谁敬仰和崇拜全世界最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席，积极地学习、宣传、执行和捍卫久经考验的无产阶级的最高真理——毛泽东思想，谁就是“卑躬屈膝”；反之，谁猖狂地反对毛主席，顽固地反对毛泽东思想，谁就是“坚强正直”。真是反动到了极点！
    显然，陆定一所鼓吹的“魏征精神”，就是反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的反革命精神；他所鼓吹的魏征那样的反对派，就是妄图颠覆无产阶级专政的反革命派。陆定一之所以在一九六二年急急忙忙抛出《魏征传》，打出“魏征那样的反对派”的黑旗来，就是以为他们篡党篡国的时机快到了，要赶紧为以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部反对毛主席和毛泽东思想的罪恶活动制造反革命舆论，让他们这个反革命修正主义集团更加猖狂地进行篡党篡国的阴谋活动。这也是为了借古人的服装，把他们这一小撮党内的大野心家、大阴谋家乔装打扮起来，似乎他们都是“魏征”式的“忧国忧民”、“忠心正直”的人物，来欺骗人民。他们还想借此进一步煽动、纠集和掩护党内党外一切牛鬼蛇神，从各方面向毛主席和毛泽东思想发动疯狂的进攻，来个里应外合，内外夹攻。一句话，这就是为颠覆以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，在我国复辟资本主义加紧制造舆论。
    历史一再证明，当马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在党内占统治地位的情况下，谁要在党内搞什么反对派，那就完全违反党的利益和全体革命群众的意志，那就是反革命派，不管用什么名目，玩什么花招，终将碰得头破血流。
    今天，我们伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，已经严正地宣判了党内的反革命派——以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部的政治死刑。
    借唐太宗影射攻击伟大领袖毛主席
    早在一九五七年五月，资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻达到顶峰，我党反击右派的前夕，陆定一就在旧中宣部工作人员大会上，恶毒地影射攻击伟大领袖毛主席。一九六二年，陆定一又通过《魏征传》，用含沙射影的手法，借魏征批评唐太宗“得志”之后，不虚心“纳谏”，影射攻击伟大领袖毛主席，胡说什么“只相信一方面的话”呀，“遏止真理的发扬”呀，等等。他在党的扩大的中央工作会议上鼓吹“魏征精神”时，还疯狂地攻击毛主席和我们党“不要群众路线，只搞阶级路线”，“党没有群众路线，就象国民党，名为共产党，实际是国民党，以党治国，一个党，一个领袖，一个主义，一个政府”。这真是一派反动透顶、荒唐已极的谰言。
    毛主席最伟大、最谦虚，是坚持群众路线的最光辉的典范，是坚持民主集中制的最光辉的典范。正如林彪同志所说的：“毛主席是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。毛主席最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心！”恰恰是陆定一及其后台中国赫鲁晓夫，长期作威作福，大搞“一言堂”，实行资产阶级专政，是镇压革命的大阎王。
    陆定一攻击说：“不要群众路线，只搞阶级路线”。试问，在有阶级的社会里，群众是划分为阶级的，如果离开了阶级路线，抽掉了阶级观点，还有什么抽象的群众路线呢？陆定一曾经露骨地说过，“逃亡地主，也应该团结”，“包括牢里的囚犯”，也是“文艺服务的对象”。陆定一之流心目中的群众，是反党分子、叛徒、反革命修正主义分子和地、富、反、坏、右。毛主席教导我们：“剥夺反动派的发言权，只让人民有发言权。”对于阶级敌人，对于自命为“当代魏征”的陆定一之流，我们就是要“拒”他们的“谏”，专他们的政！如果依了他们，就要亡党亡国，使中国大倒退，使世界革命遭受严重的挫折。
    陆定一攻击毛主席和我们党“以党治国”，这是从资产阶级右派那里拾来的牙慧。
    任何阶级都通过自己的政党来实行本阶级的专政。无产阶级正是通过自己的政党——共产党的领导，来实行革命的专政的。陆定一之流叫嚷反对“以党治国”，无非是反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的党“治”社会主义的“国”，而想以修正主义的党“治”资本主义复辟了的“国”。
    陆定一之流拚死命地叫嚷反对“一个党，一个领袖，一个主义，一个政府”，这是他们妄图颠覆以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，篡党篡国的自我招供。
    他们是妄图在反对“一个领袖”的口号下，抬出反革命修正主义的头目中国赫鲁晓夫，来取代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们最敬爱的领袖毛主席；妄图在反对“一个主义”的口号下，端出一套修正主义货色，取代伟大的毛泽东思想，使我党我国蜕化变质，改变颜色。
    毛主席教导我们：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。指导我们思想的理论基础是马克思列宁主义。”我们要巩固无产阶级专政，巩固和发展社会主义制度，就是要最坚决地拥护以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党的领导；就是要以最大的忠诚爱戴我国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖、伟大导师毛主席；就是要无限信仰当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。海可枯，石可烂，忠于毛主席和毛泽东思想的红心永不变！
    陆定一还利用《魏征传》，重复《海瑞罢官》的反动腔调，替大阴谋家、大野心家、大军阀彭德怀和一切右倾机会主义分子鸣冤叫屈，反攻倒算。
    毛主席教导我们：“一个人，一个党，一个军队，或者一个学校，如若不被敌人反对，那就不好了，那一定是同敌人同流合污了。如若被敌人反对，那就好了，那就证明我们同敌人划清界线了。如若敌人起劲地反对我们，把我们说得一塌糊涂，一无是处，那就更好了，那就证明我们不但同敌人划清了界线，而且证明我们的工作是很有成绩的了。”
    老反革命陆定一对毛主席的恶毒的诋毁和诬蔑，丝毫无损于毛主席崇高的光辉的形象，而只能证明毛主席的英明、伟大和正确。
        妄想推翻无产阶级专政
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义叛徒集团使列宁缔造的第一个社会主义国家苏联复辟了资本主义以后，毛主席就一再告诫全党，要吸取苏联的教训，防止资本主义在我国复辟。一九六二年，毛主席在党的扩大的中央工作会议上又一次敲起警钟。但是，反革命修正主义分子陆定一在会后不久，竟通过《魏征传》别有用心地提出了“以隋亡为鉴”的口号，来同毛主席的教导唱反调。
    毛主席教导我们要吸取赫鲁晓夫在苏联复辟资本主义的教训，就是要全党坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命原则，坚持无产阶级专政，坚持社会主义革命和社会主义建设总路线。而陆定一鼓吹的所谓“以隋亡为鉴”，是什么货色呢？
    陆定一在《魏征传》的前言（初稿）中说，魏征“经常劝诫唐太宗以已亡的隋朝为借鉴”，“节约民力，物力，停办一切不急之务”。他还在《魏征传》里通过魏征之口，说什么“隋朝富强而灭亡，是因为隋朝骚扰了百姓”，“不断地用兵，无休止地叫百姓服劳役”，“兴师动众”，“任意营建”，“随便兴动土木”，使百姓“疲困不堪”，“无法活命”。他甚至恶狠狠地煽动说：“骚扰了百姓就大乱。”
    一九六二年五月，陆定一更在一次会议上借魏征批评唐太宗的话说：“不要打仗，不要杀生，不要奢侈，不要动员过多民役，静就安，动就乱。”他还借题发挥说：“我们还不是动员民役太多！”
    这些黑话的意思难道还不清楚吗？
    毛主席在一九五八年根据社会主义社会发展的客观规律和全国广大人民群众改变一穷二白面貌、建设社会主义的强烈愿望，提出了总路线、大跃进和人民公社三面红旗。在这光辉的三面红旗的指引下，亿万人民群众的革命积极性、创造性如原子能似地爆发，各条战线出现一片热气腾腾的革命景象和突飞猛进的跃进局面。毛主席热情地赞扬说：“从来也没有看见人民群众象现在这样精神振奋，斗志昂扬，意气风发。”中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流，这些资产阶级在党内的代表人物，却对三面红旗恨之入骨，拚死命地进行疯狂的攻击。
    陆定一借魏征之口咒骂的什么“骚扰了百姓”，什么“不爱惜民力”，什么建设多了要“垮台”，等等，不就是对三面红旗恶毒的攻击么？不就是要我们放弃社会主义革命，放弃社会主义建设，放弃革命的群众运动么？这里还要指出的是，中国赫鲁晓夫在一九六一年五月攻击三面红旗时，就曾恶毒地说：“要知道，秦始皇是修长城，隋炀帝是开运河垮台的。”资产阶级司令部的总头目出了题目，定下调调，陆定一就大做文章，大造舆论。
      “不要打仗”，“不要用兵”，“不要杀生”，这同苏联赫鲁晓夫念的“和平经”有什么两样？这不是反对革命战争又是什么？在帝国主义和其他阶级敌人还存在的情况下，我们能够“刀枪入库”么？陆定一之流装成一副阿弥陀佛的面孔，嘴上喊着“不要用兵”，
  “不要杀生”，正是妄想借此麻痹我们的革命意志，以便他们篡党篡政篡军。如果他们的这种阴谋一旦得逞，不知要有多少人头落地！
    陆定一借魏征之口叫喊的“静就安，动就乱”，这短短的六个字，集中地反映了剥削阶级及其代理人对翻天覆地的社会主义革命的仇视和恐惧，反映了他们力图维护和恢复旧制度的反革命愿望。他们妄想束缚革命人民的手脚，好让他们更加放肆地进行反革命活动。
    《魏征传》的炮制者，为了达到不可告人的政治目的，还把《新唐书》中《魏征传》的原文“人无信不立”的原意加以歪曲，译成这样的白话：“人民对政府缺乏信心，国家是站不住的”。他以此诬蔑我国政治形势似乎岌岌可危，煽动牛鬼蛇神更加猖狂地进攻。
    陆定一还通过《魏征传》狂叫：“圣明的人乘机起事，把老百姓从危亡的境况中拯救出来。”这是一个信号！表明中国赫鲁晓夫和陆定一之流自封为“圣明的人”，想要“乘机起事”，实行反革命政变。
    总之，陆定一通过《魏征传》所鼓吹的这一套，目的就是配合国内外阶级敌人，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反对毛主席的正确领导，妄想使新中国的航船背离毛主席所指引的社会主义航向，走回头路。
                    ＊　＊　＊
    马克思有一段名言，用来形容《魏征传》的炮制者是很恰当的：“他们战战兢兢地请出亡灵来给他们以帮助，借用它们的名字、战斗口号和衣服，以便穿着这种久受崇敬的服装，用这种借来的语言，演出世界历史的新场面。”
    陆定一之流请出封建奴才的“亡灵”之一就是魏征，他们想演出的“新场面”就是妄图颠覆毛主席和共产党所领导的无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。但是，客观事物的发展总是违反反动派的主观愿望的。谁反对伟大的毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想，谁就要被人民打倒。陆定一之流请出的“亡灵”并没有帮得了他们的忙。这一小撮反革命小丑演出的“新场面”，不过是更快地促使他们自己灭亡罢了。
