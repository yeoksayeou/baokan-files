The Group of Masamichi Miyamoto is a Strike Force for US-Japanese Reactionaries
Openly Conspiring with Japanese Reactionaries to Sabotage the Visit of the Red East Circus Troupe to Japan

New China News Agency, Tokyo: The Masamichi Miyamoto revisionist clique of the Japanese Communist Party has shamelessly sabotaged the visit of the Red East Circus Troupe of the People's Republic of China, thoroughly exposing its frenzied anti-China stance, its sabotage of Sino-Japanese friendship, and its role as a strike force for US-Japanese reactionaries.

Before the Red East Circus Troupe arrived in Japan, the Miyamoto revisionist clique not only secretly conspired with Japanese reactionaries to obstruct the troupe's entry, but also, for over a month, through its mouthpiece the "Akahata" and the pseudo "Japan-China Friendship Association" it controls, openly engaged in a large-scale campaign of slander against the Chinese circus troupe, disrupting the welcoming activities being prepared by the masses in various parts of Japan.

After failing in their plot to obstruct the entry of the Chinese circus troupe, the Miyamoto clique intensified its attacks on the Red East Circus Troupe. On October 17, just a few days after the Chinese circus troupe's performance in Japan, the "Director of the United Front Department" of the Miyamoto clique, Shimosuji Jun'ichi, openly shouted in the "Akahata" that the performances of the Chinese circus troupe "cannot be allowed," directing a small group of followers in various places to carry out sabotage activities.

Some of the Miyamoto clique's followers in local areas even shouted that sabotaging the performances of the Chinese circus troupe was the "biggest political issue" for the Japanese revisionists.

In Okayama and Yamagata prefectures, Japanese revisionist elements openly threatened organizations and individuals participating in the welcoming committee for the Chinese circus troupe to withdraw from the welcoming committee, but these threats were firmly rejected. In Shimonioseki City, some Japanese revisionist elements went around destroying the welcoming banners already set up for the Chinese circus troupe. The revolutionary masses of Shimonioseki were extremely indignant and went to the "Committee" of the Japanese revisionists in the Shimonioseki area to protest, discovering on the spot a large pile of banner cloth torn down by the Japanese revisionists.

On October 28, Japanese revisionist elements in Shimonioseki City even attacked with iron bars the car of the people from the (authentic) Japan-China Friendship Association branch who were repairing the banners, injuring people. They also conspired with Japanese police to persecute the staff of the welcoming committee for the Chinese Red East Circus Troupe.

However, all these sabotage activities by the Miyamoto clique have failed. Under the enthusiastic welcome and strong support of the people in various places, the Red East Circus Troupe has successfully performed in seven cities including Tokyo, Yokohama, Fukushima, Kyoto, Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe, with nearly 40,000 people watching the performances. Japanese friends pointed out that the Miyamoto clique, which has degenerated into counter-revolutionary revisionism, is not surprising in its extreme opposition to the Chinese circus troupe's visit to Japan. However, the broad masses of the Japanese people sincerely welcome the Chinese circus troupe. The anti-China activities of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists can only further expose their own ugly faces. The visit of the Red East Circus Troupe to Japan will definitely achieve great success.

    宫本集团是美日反动派的别动队
    公然勾结日本反动派破坏我东方红杂技团访日演出
    新华社东京电　日共宫本修正主义集团肆无忌惮地破坏中华人民共和国东方红杂技团访日演出，彻底地暴露了它疯狂反华、破坏日中友好，充当美日反动派别动队的面目。
    在中国东方红杂技团到日本之前，宫本修正主义集团不但暗地里勾结日本反动派阴谋阻挠杂技团的入境，而且从一个多月以前，就开始通过它的喉舌《赤旗报》和它所控制的伪“日中友协”，公开进行大量的诽谤中国杂技团的宣传，破坏日本各地群众正在准备的欢迎活动。
    在阻挠中国杂技团入境的阴谋失败以后，宫本集团攻击东方红杂技团的宣传变本加厉。十月十七日，中国杂技团刚刚在日本公演不久，宫本集团的“统战部长”下司顺吉在《赤旗报》上公开叫嚷“不能放任”中国杂技团的公演，指使各地的一小撮走卒进行破坏活动。
    宫本集团在地方上的一些走卒甚至叫嚣，破坏中国杂技团的公演是日修的“最大政治课题”。
    冈山、山形等县的日修分子竟公然胁迫参加欢迎中国杂技团公演委员会的团体和个人退出欢迎委员会，但是受到了这些团体和个人的严词拒绝。下关市的一些日修分子四下出动，捣毁已经布置好的欢迎中国杂技团公演的宣传牌。下关革命群众无比愤怒，到日修下关地区“委员会”抗议，当场发现一大堆被日修分子撕下来的宣传牌的布片。
    十月二十八日，下关市的日修分子竟手持铁棒袭击了进行修补宣传牌的日中友协（正统）支部的人的汽车，打伤了人。他们还勾结日本警察对欢迎中国东方红杂技团委员会的干部进行迫害。
    但是，宫本集团的这一系列破坏活动都遭到失败。中国东方红杂技团在各地人民的热烈欢迎和大力支持下，已经成功地在东京、横滨、福岛、京都、名古屋、大阪、神户等七个城市进行了十场公演，近四万人观看了演出。日本朋友们指出，已经堕落成为反革命修正主义的宫本集团，极力反对中国杂技团访问日本是不奇怪的，但是广大日本人民从心眼里欢迎中国杂技团。日共修正主义分子的反华活动，只能进一步暴露它自己的丑恶面目。中国东方红杂技团访日公演一定会取得巨大成功。
