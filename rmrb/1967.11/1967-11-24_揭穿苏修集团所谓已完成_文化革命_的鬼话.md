The earth-shaking Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution has shaken the "throne" of the Soviet revisionist clique, frightening Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang of traitors to the point of losing their wits. Over the past year, in order to block the influence of the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution and maintain their revisionist rule, they have fabricated all sorts of shameless lies to deceive the people. They have repeatedly stammered and declared that the "cultural revolution" in the Soviet Union has been "victoriously completed" and has achieved "great successes."

What a "victoriously completed"! This clumsy attempt to deceive is truly laughable!

What exactly is the so-called "cultural revolution" of the Soviet revisionist clique? Let's see how they themselves explain it in a confused manner:

"Cultural revolution is a complex and long-term process. Under the difficult conditions of cultural backwardness, a severe lack of skilled cadres, and financial constraints in our country, the state has established a new national education system that guarantees universal literacy, rapidly develops science and culture, and educates a new generation of citizens with socialist spirit."

Following this tune, the Soviet revisionist clique mobilized all their propaganda machinery to boast about the "achievements" of their "cultural revolution." They talked about how many cinemas were built, how many films were produced, how many schools were opened, how many people enrolled, and so on. Is this a "cultural revolution"? No, it is a big fraud! If this is called a "cultural revolution," then the poisonous films produced annually by Hollywood, whether in quantity or quality, are hardly inferior to the Moscow Film Studio. Can't we say that the United States has also "completed" the "cultural revolution"?

The proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. Its task is to expose and overthrow the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the government, and various cultural circles, and to expose and overthrow ambitious and conspiratorial figures like Khrushchev; it is to reform education, literature and art, and all superstructures that do not conform to the socialist economic base; it is to carry out self-criticism and criticize revisionism, to arm people's minds with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, to use proletarian ideology to defeat bourgeois ideology, and to achieve the transformation of people's ideology. Without the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is impossible to talk about the proletarian Cultural Revolution. If the power is in the hands of bourgeois representatives, it is impossible to carry out a proletarian cultural revolution, but only a bourgeois cultural counter-revolution!

Now, let's see what kind of tricks the Soviet revisionist traitors have played in their so-called "cultural revolution"!

As early as the 22nd Congress of the CPSU, the Khrushchev clique had already written the thoroughly bourgeois reactionary slogan of "culture for all people and all humanity" into the party program of the CPSU. The proposal of this slogan opened the door for the decaying and reactionary culture of the West to enter the Soviet Union. All the most reactionary, decadent, and ugly things in capitalist societies were promoted by this gang of traitors as the newest and most fashionable treasures in the Soviet Union.

In this regard, Khrushchev had already done enough shameful things. In 1962, he personally went to cheer for an American jazz band's first performance in the Soviet Union, applauding and praising it. Now, Brezhnev and Kosygin have gone even further than their predecessors. Not only cheering is not enough, they further established this music that reeks of bourgeois stench as a traditional music festival, "to be held every year, with increasingly larger scales." A leader of a self-proclaimed socialist country loves the garbage of the exploiting class so much, it is indeed regrettable and tragic. However, the efforts of the old and new revisionist cliques have not been in vain. Their hawking has already been appreciated by Western bourgeois newspapers, which praised them, saying: "The Soviet Union is advancing on the road to Westernization." Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk must be flattered, right?

Of course, the "great achievements" of the Soviet revisionist clique's "cultural revolution" are not limited to this. They also carried out great achievements in the literary and artistic circles to restore capitalism. They adapted the yellow and violent plays that were criticized during the period when Stalin led the Soviet Union into films and sent them to participate in international film festivals; they regarded the traitor Pasternak's reactionary novel "Doctor Zhivago," which maliciously cursed the October Revolution as a "historical mistake" and an "irreversible disaster," as a treasure; they gave a bunch of bourgeois dregs and counter-revolutionaries the honor of wearing laurel wreaths, allowing them to reoccupy the Soviet literary and artistic stage. As for the ancestor of revisionist and traitor literature, Sholokhov, they praised him to the skies.

The old generation of bourgeois reactionary literati is so rampant, what about the new generation?

Since the notorious 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU, a group of so-called "fourth-generation" writers who claim to be the "products of the 20th and 22nd Congresses of the CPSU" have emerged on the Soviet literary scene, such as Chukhrai and Yevtushenko. These people were born in the Soviet Union during the era of proletarian dictatorship but were nourished by the milk of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. They are not only a group of anti-China, anti-communist, and counter-revolutionary vanguards personally fostered by the Soviet revisionist clique but are also degenerate literati in the style of hoodlums. The United States has a "beat generation." Aren't these so-called "fourth-generation" in the Soviet Union just as degenerate as the "beat generation" in the United States?

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A certain culture (as an ideological form of culture) is a reflection of the politics and economy of a certain society and, in turn, has a great influence and effect on the politics and economy of a certain society." The capitalist cultural filth that is rampant today on Soviet soil is a reflection of the Soviet revisionist traitors' political promotion of revisionism and economic restoration of capitalism, and at the same time, it serves their politics and economy.

People are heartbroken to see that the Soviet socialist industry, which once shocked the capitalist world and demonstrated great power in the Great Patriotic War, has now degenerated into a capitalist economy. The Soviet revisionist traitors boast that they are implementing a "new economic system" that is the most wonderful in the world. What "new economic system"! It is nothing but "profit first," promoting material incentives, "everything for money, money is everything." The blood and sweat of workers are transformed into profits, which flow in large quantities into the pockets of the privileged class, while they themselves have only the right to be beasts of burden. The vast rural areas of the Soviet Union were once the first places in the world to implement collectivization. But now? Collectivization has long been a hollow shell, and a so-called "new system" of "dividing land to the team" is being widely promoted. "Managers," "farm directors," and "farm chairmen" wander around all day, but they have incomes tens or even hundreds of times higher than ordinary farmers. The broad masses of farmers endure various exploitations and oppressions. What "new system" is this? This is nothing but the old capitalist system!

To turn the first socialist state in the world, personally created and led by Lenin and Stalin, into such a state, this is the "great achievement" of the "cultural revolution" boasted by the Soviet revisionist traitors! What "cultural revolution"! It is actually using bourgeois culture to carry out "peaceful evolution" and restore capitalism!

People ask: The homeland of the October Revolution has undergone such a great retrogression in just fifty years. How did all this happen?

Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us: The fundamental question of the revolution is the question of power. Today, the rulers in the Soviet Union, the Soviet revisionist leadership headed by Brezhnev and Kosygin, are the same as their predecessors, Khrushchev and his ilk. They represent the interests of the new bourgeoisie, the interests of a small privileged class. The power of the party, government, economy, and culture in the Soviet Union is in the hands of these traitors of the proletariat, and the state machine is in the hands of these bourgeois representatives. How can what they implement be the dictatorship of the proletariat rather than the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie? How can what they walk be the socialist road rather than the capitalist road?

The historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat indisputably proves: After the proletariat seizes power, in order to maintain the proletarian power from changing color, it must continue the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat and carry out the proletarian cultural revolution to expose the most dangerous enemies of the proletarian dictatorship who are hiding! We must never let Khrushchev-like figures come to power and take the stage, as in the Soviet Union!

Now, our country's proletarian Cultural Revolution is like a red sun rising from the east, illuminating the earth with its boundless rays, brightening the eyes of the Soviet people, and igniting the anger that has been suppressed by the Soviet revisionist clique in their hearts. This has awakened the great Soviet people, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, more quickly and widely. This has frightened the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. The fate of the exploiting class and their representatives on Chinese soil has made Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk immediately foresee their own doom. Yesterday, they were everywhere, praising themselves for living in a paradise without contradictions and without classes, and it was said that they had "reached the threshold of communism"; but today, they are like sitting on pins and needles, as if surrounded by explosives, fearing that a spark might fly over at any moment. Thus, these anxious old men, in addition to mobilizing all propaganda machinery to curse the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution, this "terrible monster," at the same time, ordered all measures to be taken to block it tightly, not allowing even a bit of true news about the Chinese proletarian Cultural Revolution to get in. But there is no wall in the world that can block the truth. The great Soviet people, through layer upon layer of blockades, heard the rumbling thunder more intimately from the land of their brother China and saw the blazing flames. An old Soviet worker said well: "There will definitely be a second 1917 in the Soviet Union!" This is the voice of the Soviet working class, which has a glorious revolutionary tradition. In their extreme panic and desperate struggle, the traitor leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique suddenly came up with a brilliant idea, bringing in a group of court literati, and after a lot of racking their brains to fabricate, they proudly announced: The Soviet Union has "victoriously completed" the "cultural revolution"...

But can this stop the truth? No, this is just a paper wall. Paper not only cannot wrap up fire but will make the fire burn even more fiercely. The lie of the Soviet revisionist traitors boasting that the Soviet Union has completed the "cultural revolution" will have such a result and must have such a result!

    揭穿苏修集团所谓已完成“文化革命”的鬼话
    罗思鼎
    惊天动地的中国无产阶级文化大革命，震撼了苏修集团的“宝座”，把勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒吓得魂不附体。一年多来，他们为了阻挡中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，维持他们的修正主义统治，编造了种种无耻的鬼话，用以欺骗人民。他们不止一次地嗫嗫嚅嚅地宣布说：苏联的“文化革命”已经“胜利完成”，并取得了“伟大成就”。
    好一个“胜利完成”！这种拙劣的遮眼法，实在令人发笑！
    苏修集团的所谓“文化革命”究竟是什么玩艺儿？且看他们自己是怎样颠三倒四地向人们解说的：
      “文化革命是一个复杂而长期的过程。在我国文化落后，极其缺乏熟练干部和资金的困难条件下，国家建立了保障居民普遍识字、迅速发展科学文化，用社会主义精神教育成长的一代的新型国民教育体系。”
    根据这个调子，苏修集团把全部宣传机器开动起来，大肆吹嘘他们的“文化革命”的“成果”。什么设置了多少多少个电影院呀，拍了多少多少部电影呀，什么开办了多少多少个学校呀，有多少多少个人入学呀，等等，等等。这叫“文化革命”吗？不，这是一个大骗局！如果这也叫“文化革命”，那末，美国好莱坞每年制造的毒草电影，无论数量上、质量上都很难说比莫斯科电影片厂逊色，岂不是可以说美国也“完成”了“文化革命”！
    无产阶级文化大革命是巩固无产阶级专政的大革命。它的任务是要把混进党里、政府里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物揪出来，把赫鲁晓夫那样的野心家、阴谋家揪出来，彻底打倒；是要改革教育，改革文艺，改革一切不适应于社会主义经济基础的上层建筑；是要斗私批修，用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装人们的头脑，用无产阶级思想去战胜资产阶级思想，实现人的思想革命化。离开无产阶级专政，根本谈不上无产阶级文化大革命。如果政权是掌握在资产阶级代表人物手里，那就不可能搞无产阶级的文化革命，而只能搞资产阶级的文化反革命！
    现在，就让我们来看一看，苏修叛徒集团的所谓“文化革命”究竟搞了些什么名堂吧！
    早在苏共第二十二次代表大会上，赫鲁晓夫集团就已经把“全民的、全人类的文化”这一彻头彻尾的资产阶级反动口号写在苏共的党纲上。这个口号的提出，为西方反动没落的资产阶级文化进入苏联敞开了大门。所有资本主义社会中最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的东西，都被这一伙叛徒当作最新颖、最时髦的宝贝拚命在苏联推销起来。
    在这方面，赫鲁晓夫做得已经够无耻的了。一九六二年，他曾亲自跑去为一个美国的爵士乐队在苏联首次演出捧场、喝采、叫好。而现在的勃列日涅夫、柯西金比他们的前任走得更远。单是捧场还嫌不够，他们进一步把这种散发着资产阶级臭气熏天的靡靡之音作为传统的音乐节固定下来，“每年都要举行，规模越来越大”。一个自称为社会主义国家的首脑，竟如此钟爱剥削阶级的垃圾，实在可叹而又可悲。不过，新老修正主义集团的力气并没有白费，他们的叫卖声早已为西方资产阶级报刊所赏识，誉之曰：“苏联正在西欧化的大道上前进”。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流该受宠若惊了吧？
    当然，苏修集团“文化革命”的“伟大成就”并不止此。他们还在文艺界，大搞复辟资本主义的“成就”。他们把斯大林领导苏联时期被批判的黄色情杀剧改编成影片，拿去参加国际电影节；他们把叛国分子帕斯捷尔纳克恶毒咒骂十月革命是“历史的错误”和“无法挽救的灾难”的反动小说《日瓦戈医生》视为至宝；他们给大批资产阶级的残渣余孽和反革命分子一个个都戴上荣誉的桂冠，让他们重新霸占苏联的文艺舞台。至于修正主义和叛徒文学的鼻祖肖洛霍夫，更被他们捧上了天。
    老的一代资产阶级反动文人如此猖狂，新的一代又怎样呢？
    自从臭名远扬的苏共二十大和二十二大之后，苏修文坛上出现了一批以“苏共二十大和二十二大的产儿”自命的所谓“第四代”作家，如丘赫莱依、叶甫图申柯之流。这批人出生在无产阶级专政时代的苏联，却为资产阶级和修正主义的奶汁所喂养。他们既是一批为苏修集团一手扶植起来的反华、反共、反革命的急先锋，又都是流氓阿飞式的堕落文人。美国有一个“垮掉的一代”。苏联的这些所谓“第四代”不是同美国的“垮掉的一代”一样垮得厉害吗？
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“一定的文化（当作观念形态的文化）是一定社会的政治和经济的反映，又给予伟大影响和作用于一定社会的政治和经济”。在今天苏联土地上泛滥的这一股资本主义文化的污泥浊水，就是苏修叛徒集团在政治上推行修正主义和在经济上复辟资本主义的反映，同时又为他们的这种政治和经济服务的。
    人们痛心地看到，曾经震撼了资本主义世界并在伟大卫国战争中显示过强大威力的苏联社会主义工业，如今已经蜕变成为资本主义经济。苏修叛徒集团大吹大擂，说他们正在实行一种世界上最美妙的“新经济体制”。什么“新经济体制”！无非就是“利润挂帅”，大搞物质刺激，“一切为了赚钱，赚钱就是一切”。工人的血汗化为利润，大量地落入了特权阶层的腰包，而他们自己只有做牛做马的权利。苏联的广大农村，曾经是世界上最先实行集体化的地方。可是现在呢？集体化早已名存实亡，一种所谓“分田到组”的“新制度”正在全面推广。“经理”、“场长”、“农庄主席”成天东游西逛，却占有超过一般农民十倍、几十倍的收入，广大农民忍受着种种剥削和压迫。哪里是什么“新制度”，这不是彻头彻尾的资本主义老制度吗？
    把列宁、斯大林亲手缔造和亲自领导的世界上第一个社会主义国家搞到如此这般地步，这就是苏修叛徒集团所吹嘘的“文化革命”的“伟大成就”！什么“文化革命”！原来就是通过资产阶级文化，搞“和平演变”，搞资本主义复辟！
    人们要问：十月革命的故乡，竟然在五十年后来了这么个大倒退，这一切究竟是怎么发生的呢？
    毛主席反复教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。今天在苏联的当权者，以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修领导集团，和前任赫鲁晓夫之流一样，他们代表的是新资产阶级的利益，一小撮特权阶层的利益。苏联的党、政、财、文大权就落在这些无产阶级的叛徒手里，国家的机器就掌握在这些资产阶级代表人物手里。试问，他们所实行的，怎么可能是无产阶级专政而不是资产阶级专政呢？他们所走的，怎么可能是社会主义道路而不是资本主义道路呢？
    无产阶级专政的历史经验无可争辩地证明：无产阶级在夺取政权后，为了保持无产阶级的政权永不变色，必须在无产阶级专政条件下继续进行革命，必须进行无产阶级文化大革命，把隐藏着的无产阶级政权最危险的敌人揪出来！千万千万不能象苏联那样，让赫鲁晓夫式的人物当了权、上了台啊！
    现在我国的无产阶级文化大革命，犹如一轮红日从东方升起，以她无际的光焰普照着大地，擦亮了苏联人民的眼睛，引发了他们被苏修集团压在心底的怒火，更迅速、更广泛地唤起了广大具有光荣的革命传统的伟大的苏联人民的觉醒。这一下，可吓坏了苏修叛徒集团一窝。兔死狐悲，中国大地上的剥削阶级及其代表人物的命运，使勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流立即预感到自己末日的来临。昨天，他们还到处游说，赞美自己处身于没有对抗、没有阶级的“仙境”，而且据说“已经迈到共产主义的门槛”；而今天，他们却似坐针毡，仿佛周围堆满了炸药，就怕什么时候有一颗火星飞过来。于是，这些惶惶不可终日的老爷们，除了开动一切宣传机器，拚命诅咒中国无产阶级文化大革命这个“可怕的怪物”以外，同时下令采取一切措施，进行严密封锁，决不让中国无产阶级文化大革命的真实消息进去一星半点。但是，世界上没有可以阻挡真理的围墙。伟大的苏联人民，透过层层封锁，更加亲切地从兄弟的中国土地上，听到了隆隆的春雷，看到了熊熊的火光。一位苏联老工人说得好：“在苏联一定会出现第二个一九一七年！”这就是具有光荣的革命传统的苏联工人阶级的声音。苏修领导集团的叛徒们在极度恐慌和绝望挣扎之中，忽然想出一条妙计，找来一批御用文人，进行了好一番挖空心思的编造，接着就兴冲冲地宣布：苏联已经“胜利完成”了“文化革命”……。
    可是，难道这是能够阻挡真理的铜墙铁壁吗？不，这只是一道纸糊的围墙。纸非但包不住火，并将使火烧得更旺。苏修叛徒集团吹嘘苏联已经完成“文化革命”的谎言，其结果，只能是这样，也必将是这样！
