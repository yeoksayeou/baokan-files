The revolutionary rebels of the proletariat at the Nanchang Railway Bureau, with the assistance of the People's Liberation Army in carrying out the "support left" tasks, have launched a new high tide in transportation production under the banner of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." In October, the entire bureau exceeded the transportation targets for more than 20 key items, including coal, grain, and export commodities. The volume of freight transported increased by 55.6% compared to September, and the number of cars unloaded increased by 63.2%.
