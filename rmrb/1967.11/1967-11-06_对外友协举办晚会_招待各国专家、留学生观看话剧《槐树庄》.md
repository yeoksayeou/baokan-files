The China's Foreign Affairs Friendship Association hosted evening galas on the 2nd and 3rd of November to invite foreign experts, students, and interns in Beijing to watch the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Art Troupe's newly revised and staged five-act play "Huai Shu Zhuang."

This play, revised during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, reflects the class struggle, the struggle between two lines, and the struggle between two roads in China's rural areas. It vividly depicts the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants firmly following the great leader Chairman Mao in walking the socialist road. At the end of the performance, a portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao appeared on the stage curtain, and the entire audience enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Chairman Mao is the great savior of the people!"

Relevant responsible persons and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the Beijing Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army attended the performance.
