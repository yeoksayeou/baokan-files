To effectively address the issue of superior-subordinate relationships and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience.

	Chairman Mao said, "To effectively address the issue of superior-subordinate relationships and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

	Follow Chairman Mao's Latest Instructions to Improve Relations Between Cadres and the Masses

	Revolutionary cadres, old and new, Red Guards, and PLA soldiers and officers from all over the country have expressed their determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, closely connect with the masses, and forever be faithful servants of the people.

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 16th, our great leader Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions on effectively addressing the issue of superior-subordinate relationships and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses have greatly inspired revolutionary cadres, revolutionary masses, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, and the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country. Broad masses of old and new revolutionary cadres are extremely moved and express that Chairman Mao's latest instructions teach us: "To effectively address the issue of superior-subordinate relationships and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, cadres should go down to the grassroots, walk around, and see for themselves. They should adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." This is the greatest care, love, encouragement, and exhortation from our great leader Chairman Mao. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, unconditionally follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, improve superior-subordinate relationships, improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, seriously adhere to the mass line, forever be with the masses, forever be students of the masses, forever maintain revolutionary youth, and forever ensure that our great proletarian dictatorship does not change color.

	Revolutionary cadres and the masses from various places have seriously studied the instructions from Chairman Mao's latest instructions conveyed in today's People's Daily editorial note and the editorial "Support Revolutionary New Cadres Warmly" from Wen Hui Bao. They said that at the decisive moment of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the publication of Chairman Mao's great instructions has extremely great significance. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are a great call to further promote our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a long-term plan to prevent and guard against revisionism. We must study them repeatedly, carry them out resolutely, and implement them in actions as soon as possible. Revolutionary cadres from the Beijing Stamp Factory said after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions that Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the greatest care and love for us cadres, a guiding light for our progress, and a great program to prevent us from degenerating and promote our ideological revolutionization. We must remember Chairman Mao's latest instructions, fight against selfishness and revise our thinking, and work with the masses to improve the struggle-criticism-transformation in our units and achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution. Members of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and former member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Secretariat Ma Tian Shui said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions are our guidelines for solving superior-subordinate relationships and improving the relationship between cadres and the masses. It relates to whether our cadres can remain uncorrupted, whether our proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated, and whether we can improve the struggle-criticism-transformation and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must study them seriously and implement them resolutely. New and old revolutionary cadres from the Changsha Automobile Electrical Factory said, Chairman Mao's latest instructions have extremely great significance for cultivating and training tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and consolidating and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship. The leader of the Ningxia Proletarian Revolutionary Headquarters said, the strongest weapon against revisionism is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the best way to prevent revisionism is to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions at all times. We must closely connect with the masses, fight against selfishness and revise our thinking under the supervision of the masses, thoroughly transform our worldview, and become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

	Members of the revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs and revolutionary cadres from various places believe that to effectively address the issue of superior-subordinate relationships and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, the most important and fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and adhere to the mass line. Fan Ru Yun, chairman of the Shanxi Red Guard Textile Factory Revolutionary Committee, said, the mass line is the fundamental line of our party and an important guarantee for the victory of our revolutionary cause. Our experience shows that as long as we adhere to the mass line, we will have a clear understanding of the situation, have many solutions, have the right direction, and be able to correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Members of the Jinan First Carpet Factory Revolutionary Committee said, proletarian revolutionary cadres must firmly believe in and rely on the masses to exercise power well. Since the establishment of our revolutionary committee, we have suffered from not believing in and relying on the masses, and we have also tasted the sweetness of believing in and relying on the masses. Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the true heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." This sentence is indeed true.

	Revolutionary cadres from various places pointed out that resolutely implementing the great strategic measure of "cadres must participate in collective productive labor" by our great leader Chairman Mao is an important guarantee for the proletarian dictatorship not to change color. They said, the important reason why many cadres make mistakes is that they are detached from labor and the masses. We must not take this path. Members of the leadership of the Tianjin Hemp Textile Factory Revolutionary Committee have always insisted on participating in two days of productive labor every week. They also often listen to the opinions and criticisms of the masses through rectification, cadre-mass meetings, and individual chats. Today, the new and old revolutionary cadres of this factory's revolutionary committee held a meeting and expressed their determination to resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, "completely" and "thoroughly" serve the people, adhere to the mass line, and forever be students of the masses. New and old revolutionary cadres from many grassroots units in Nanchang recently, except for leaving a very small number of people to handle daily work, all went to the production front line, labored with the broad revolutionary masses, consulted with them, fought against selfishness and revised their thinking together, grasped the revolution, and promoted production. After studying the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, they decided to walk the mass line more seriously and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses.

	Many new and old revolutionary cadres in the revolutionary three-in-one temporary power organs in various regions feel more and more affectionate and more and more responsible as they study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They expressed their determination to learn from each other, trust each other, cooperate closely, and improve together, so that the leadership of the revolutionary three-in-one will always be full of fighting spirit. Li Yuanrong, a standing committee member of the Qingdao Revolutionary Committee and former mayor of Qingdao, said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has pushed a large number of revolutionary new cadres to leadership positions, which is a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Revolutionary new cadres are full of vigor and have few conservative ideas. I must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, learn from the strengths of revolutionary new cadres, and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Some revolutionary old cadres in the standing committee of the Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee expressed their determination to learn from the strengths of revolutionary new cadres and enthusiastically help them. Some revolutionary new cadres in the standing committee also expressed their determination to better learn from revolutionary old cadres and fight shoulder to shoulder with them to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution. Old Red Army soldier Zhang Xianhui and revolutionary leading cadre Wang Zhichao, who are studying at the Mao Zedong Thought study class in the Guizhou Revolutionary Committee, said, helping and cultivating new cadres is the responsibility of revolutionary old cadres. Revolutionary old cadres have work experience and lessons, and we must provide these to new cadres as a reference. We must not not help and educate revolutionary new cadres. Revolutionary new cadres, members of the provincial revolutionary committee Chen Weirong and Kang Yuguo, said, we must take "fighting against selfishness and revising our thinking" as the key, transform our worldview, and resolutely smash the attacks of the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and be proletarian revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the PLA Army, Navy, and Air Force warmly applauded the publication of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. They expressed their determination to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions deeply and thoroughly, and implement them word for word and sentence by sentence. Many veteran revolutionary cadres, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also shared their personal experiences of the superior-subordinate and cadre-mass relationships in the Red Army era with cadres and soldiers, and expressed their determination to implement Chairman Mao's great teachings together with everyone, carry forward the fine traditions of the Red Army era. After listening to the broadcast, the leading cadres of a certain unit of the Navy on the front line of the South China Sea, except for leaving a few people to handle daily work, immediately packed their bags, took Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and went deep into ships, islands, and sentry posts to learn from the soldiers with the most practical experience and fight and train with them. Soldiers and officers fighting on the front line of "three supports and two militaries" unanimously believe that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have pointed out the direction for the ideological revolutionization of cadres and put forward higher requirements for our "three supports and two militaries" work. They expressed their determination to unswervingly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, help local areas improve superior-subordinate and cadre-mass relationships, help revolutionary old cadres correctly treat revolutionary new cadres, bring the fine traditions of unity between superiors and subordinates and between officers and soldiers in the army to the local areas, and raise the "three supports and two militaries" work to a new level.
