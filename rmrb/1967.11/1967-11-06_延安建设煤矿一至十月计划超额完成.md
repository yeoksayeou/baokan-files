The revolutionary workers of the Yanan Construction Coal Mine in northern Shaanxi have resolutely carried out the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "seizing revolution and promoting production." They have vigorously seized the revolution, vigorously promoted production, and have completed the production plan for the first ten months ahead of schedule and overfulfilled it. They are now vigorously pushing forward, excavating three new coal mines. After these three new coal mines are completed and put into production next year, the coal production will be more than double the current level.
