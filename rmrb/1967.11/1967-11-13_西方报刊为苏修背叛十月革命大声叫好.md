Western newspapers have loudly applauded the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the October Revolution. The head of the Russian Provisional Government before the October Revolution, Kerensky, also expressed satisfaction with the developments in the Soviet Union.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on November 12, the Soviet revisionist leadership shamelessly portray themselves as the "heirs" of Lenin's great cause, hypocritically celebrating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution in an attempt to whitewash their own faces. However, the praise from Western bourgeois newspapers for the Soviet revisionists actually exposes these counter-revolutionary revisionists as traitors to Lenin's great cause.

In the period around the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, Western bourgeois newspapers published numerous articles and editorials, loudly applauding the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of capitulating to imperialism abroad and opposing China, and fully and thoroughly restoring capitalism at home. The French newspaper *Combat* said that the Soviet revisionists have become a capitalist country that is "completely respectable." "Newspapers with the purest capitalist ideology have also congratulated the Kremlin." The British newspaper *The Guardian* openly expressed its joy over the policies pursued by the Soviet revisionist group. It said that Soviet foreign policy has become "more in line with American foreign policy," and that the Soviet economic organization has become "more like America's." The Danish newspaper *Kristeligt Dagblad* said that the Western view of the Soviet Union as an enemy "has undoubtedly changed."

Kerensky, the Prime Minister of the Russian bourgeois counter-revolutionary Provisional Government before the October Revolution, who fled to the United States after being overthrown, also expressed satisfaction with the developments in the Soviet Union. He said: "The time has come to abandon our pessimistic views on the Soviet Union." The "basic trend in the Soviet Union is the rapid development of freedom," and it is no longer concerned with "promoting world revolution."

Western newspapers are satisfied with the Soviet revisionist traitor group's policy of aligning with the United States against China and betraying the world revolution. The American newspaper *International Herald Tribune* said that now, the Soviet Union regards China as its number one enemy, while establishing relatively close relations with the United States. "Today, when Soviet spokesmen talk about foreign affairs, they do not talk about the cause of world revolution, but about big-power diplomacy."

Many newspapers also reported with great enthusiasm about the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union and the new privileged class's implementation of bourgeois dictatorship over the broad masses of laboring people. The British newspaper *Yorkshire Post* emphasized that this new interest group is "not interested in Marxism," finding it "obstructive." They want to "revise Marxism to suit" their interests.

The correspondent of the Italian newspaper *Corriere della Sera* in Moscow, based on what he saw in the Soviet Union, concluded: "The current regime, regardless of how it is evaluated, has become something fundamentally different from the revolutionary ideal." He said that after reading the outline of the Central Committee of the CPSU on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, "one can understand the extent of this degeneration."

While praising the "peaceful evolution" of the Soviet Union, Western bourgeois newspapers also expressed concern that the Soviet people with a glorious revolutionary tradition will not allow the small group of traitors in the Soviet revisionist leadership to continue their rampant behavior. The correspondent of the Italian newspaper *Corriere della Sera* lamented that the Soviet people will not allow the capitalist system to be "introduced" into the Soviet Union, "we should not harbor any illusions about this." The British newspaper *Daily Mirror* anxiously said, "The loyalty of the Soviet people (to communism) has been tested by blood, hunger, and fire." The correspondent of the Italian newspaper *Corriere della Sera* in Moscow said that he often heard many Soviet people express nostalgia and respect for Stalin, and angry denunciations of the Soviet revisionist group.

    西方报刊为苏修背叛十月革命大声叫好
    十月革命前的俄国临时政府头子克伦斯基也对苏修的发展动向表示欣慰
    据新华社十二日讯　苏修领导集团无耻地把自己装扮成列宁的伟大事业的“继承者”，装模作样地大肆“庆祝”十月革命五十周年，妄图为自己脸上贴金。但是，西方资产阶级报刊对苏修的赞赏，恰好说明这一小撮反革命修正主义分子是列宁伟大事业的无耻叛徒。
    在十月革命五十周年前后，西方的资产阶级报刊纷纷发表文章和社论，对苏修领导集团对外向帝国主义屈膝投降、敌视中国，对内全面彻底复辟资本主义的政策齐声叫好。法国的《战斗报》说，苏修已经变为资本主义国家
  “完全可以尊敬的了”。“具有最纯粹的资本主义思想的报纸也都向克里姆林宫表示祝贺”。英国的《卫报》毫不讳言对苏修集团所奉行的政策的喜悦。它说，苏联的对外政策变得和美国的对外政策“更相称”，苏联的经济组织形式也变得“更象美国”了。丹麦的《基督教报》说，西方过去长期把苏联视作敌人的看法“已经肯定无疑地改变了”。
    十月革命前的俄国资产阶级反革命临时政府总理、被推翻后潜逃美国的民族败类克伦斯基也对苏修的发展动向表示欣慰。他说：“现在，放弃我们在估计苏联动向时的悲观情绪的时候已经到来。”苏联的“基本动向是向自由迅速发展”，它关心的已“不是促进世界革命”。
    西方报纸对于苏修叛徒集团奉行联美反华、背叛世界革命的对外政策表示满意。美国的《国际先驱论坛报》说，现在，苏联把中国当作它的头号敌人了，同美国却建立了比较密切的关系。“今天，当苏联发言人谈对外事务的时候，他们不是谈世界革命事业，而是谈大国外交。”
    许多报纸还以兴高采烈的心情，报道了苏联国内资本主义全面复辟以及新的特权阶层对广大劳动人民实行资产阶级专政的情况。英国的《约克郡邮报》强调，这个新的利益集团对马克思主义“不感兴趣”，“嫌它碍事”。他们要“修正马克思主义来适应”他们利益的需要。
    意大利《晚邮报》驻莫斯科记者根据他在苏联看到的情况得出结论说：“目前这个政权，不管如何评论它，已经成了一种跟革命理想根本不同的东西。”他说，阅读了苏共中央关于十月革命五十周年的“提纲”以后“就可以了解这种沉沦的程度”。
    在赞扬苏联“和平演变”的同时，西方资产阶级的报纸也表示担心，具有光荣革命传统的苏联人民不会允许苏修领导集团一小撮叛徒胡作非为下去。意大利《晚邮报》记者哀叹，苏联人民不会允许把资本主义制度“引进”苏联，“我们对此不应该抱有幻想。”英国的《每日镜报》不安地说，“苏联人民（对共产主义）的忠诚是经受过鲜血、饥馑和烈火的考验的。”意大利《晚邮报》驻莫斯科记者说，他常听到不少苏联人对斯大林的怀念和尊敬，对苏修集团的愤怒谴责。
