The British government announced on November 18 that it would devalue the pound by 14.3 percent. This means that the official exchange rate of the pound to the dollar would be reduced from 1 pound to 2.80 dollars to 1 pound to 2.40 dollars. This is the third time the pound has been devalued. It signifies that Britain's financial and economic ailments have reached a very serious stage, and the British colonial empire is rapidly declining.

The pound is Britain's basic currency unit and is also one of the main currencies in the capitalist world's international trade. Currently, 40 percent of capitalist world trade is settled in pounds. In the past, the British colonial empire, relying on the capital it accumulated by plundering its colonies, secured the privileged position of the pound as an "international reserve currency." However, with the decline of the British Empire, the international credit of the pound has plummeted. Especially in recent years, pound crises have occurred one after another, each more severe than the last. The pound crisis has become a threat to the entire capitalist world's financial and monetary system.

Before World War I, Britain operated under the so-called "gold standard" (i.e., pound holders could exchange pounds for gold based on the legal gold content at any time). In 1931, under the impact of the capitalist world's economic crisis, Britain was forced to abandon the gold standard and announce a devaluation of the pound: reducing the official exchange rate of the pound to the dollar from 1 pound to 5 dollars to 1 pound to 4.03 dollars. The pound's position as an "international currency" was significantly weakened.

After World War II, Britain's political and economic power further declined. Its international balance of payments deteriorated, turning from a creditor nation before the war to a debtor nation. Meanwhile, American imperialism intensified its efforts to displace the pound with the dollar. All this dealt a heavy blow to the pound's international credit. In September 1949, the British government was once again forced to announce a devaluation of the pound by one-third: reducing the official exchange rate of the pound to the dollar from 1 pound to 4.03 dollars to 1 pound to 2.80 dollars. Shortly thereafter, within just over two months, 34 countries announced currency devaluations. This wave of currency devaluations shook the capitalist world's monetary system.

Since then, Britain's financial and economic strength has further declined, and the pound's position has continued to deteriorate. From the post-war period to 1964, the pound experienced eight crises. After the Labour Party came to power in 1964, in an attempt to save the financial crisis, while relying on the United States and borrowing heavily from abroad, it implemented a series of "austerity policies" that cut into the living standards of the working people. However, this practice of robbing Peter to pay Paul not only failed to solve Britain's financial crisis but also dealt a heavy blow to Britain's industrial production, which was already in a state of stagnation. As a result, Britain has sunk deeper into the abyss of deteriorating finances and economy, leading to another devaluation of the pound. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

### 英镑的三次贬值

    英镑的三次贬值
    英国政府在十一月十八日宣布，将英镑贬值百分之十四点三。这就是说，把英镑兑换美元的官方比价从原来的一英镑换二点八○美元降为一英镑换二点四○美元。这是英镑第三次贬值。它标志着，英国财政经济的痼疾已经发展到非常严重的地步，英殖民帝国正在加速衰落。
    英镑是英国的基本货币单位，同时又是资本主义世界国际贸易的主要货币之一，当前资本主义世界贸易的百分之四十是用英镑来结算的。过去，英殖民帝国凭借它掠夺殖民地而积累起来的资本，替英镑争得了“国际储备货币”的特权地位。但是随着大英帝国的衰落，英镑在国际上的信用已经一落千丈，特别是最近几年来，英镑危机一个接着一个发生，一次比一次更加严重。英镑危机已经成为威胁整个资本主义世界金融和货币体系的?疡。
    第一次世界大战前，英国实行的是所谓“金本位制”（即：英镑持有者可以根据英镑的法定含金量，随时向英国政府兑换黄金。），一九三一年时，在资本主义世界经济危机风暴的冲击下，英国被迫放弃金本位，并宣布英镑贬值：把英镑对美元的官方比价从一英镑换五美元降为一英镑换四点○三美元。英镑作为“国际货币”的地位大为削弱。
    二次大战结束后，英国的政治经济实力进一步削弱。它的国际收支状况严重恶化，从战前的债权国变成了债务国，同时美帝国主义又加紧用美元排挤英镑。这一切都使英镑在国际上的信用受到沉重打击。一九四九年九月，英国政府又一次被迫宣布，将英镑贬值三分之一：把英镑对美元的官方比价从一英镑换四点○三美元降为一英镑换二点八○美元。接着，在短短两个多月里先后有三十四个国家的货币也跟着宣布贬值。这次货币大贬值的浪潮使资本主义世界的货币体系受到了强烈震动。
    从那以后，英国的财政经济实力更加衰竭，英镑地位更是每况愈下。从战后到一九六四年，英镑就先后发生了八次危机。英国工党政府在一九六四年上台后，为了挽救财政危机，在依靠美国，大借外债的同时，推行了一系列向劳动人民生活水平开刀的“紧缩政策”。但是，这种挖肉补疮的做法不仅没有能解决英国的财政危机，反而给本来已陷于停滞状态的英国工业生产带来了沉重的打击，从而使英国在财政经济不断恶化的深渊中愈陷愈深，以致不得不再一次宣布英镑贬值。　（据新华社讯）
