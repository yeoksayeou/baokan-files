Mei Xiande, who was seriously injured in the head during the "August 6" naval battle and was honored as a combat hero, has been hospitalized for treatment for more than two years. During this period, Mei Xiande received the warm concern of our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as the enthusiastic greetings from the people across the nation. Tens of thousands of Red Guards and revolutionary masses from all over the country wrote to him. People were concerned and asked: How is Mei Xiande doing now? Has his wound healed? Has his body recovered? In this great struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, what has he done for the people? What new progress has he made on the path of ideological transformation?

Our comrade Mei Xiande has not let down Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the people of the nation. He closely follows Chairman Mao's wise teachings and the revolutionary steps of the nation, always fighting and advancing! Recently, he was honored by his unit and the medical team as an active learner of Chairman Mao's works and was selected as a representative to attend the first conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Navy. In the course of his two-year struggle, Mei Xiande, with his heroic and exemplary deeds, has composed another triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought.

Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao

Mei Xiande, the son of a poor fisherman, has feelings for Chairman Mao that are higher than the mountains and deeper than the seas. The enemy's shells may have injured his body and impaired his thinking, but they cannot destroy his heart, which is filled with limitless loyalty and love for Chairman Mao.

When he first entered the hospital, Mei Xiande, except for his heartbeat, had lost all movement in his limbs and was in a state of coma or semi-coma for a long time. He did not know how to drink water when it was brought to his lips, and he could not swallow soft food when it was placed in his mouth. No matter how he was called, he showed no response, and nothing could evoke any expression from him. The nursing team worked tirelessly, and people anxiously awaited his recovery of consciousness.

One day, Mei Xiande woke up from his coma again, staring blankly at the ceiling with dull eyes. The nurse, to test his response, brought him a magazine to look at. Page after page was turned, but Mei Xiande's face showed no reaction. As she turned the pages, the attentive nurse suddenly noticed his mouth twitch slightly, as if he wanted to speak but couldn't. At that moment, the nurse realized that Mei Xiande's eyes were fixed on a portrait of Chairman Mao. When the nurse continued to turn the pages, Mei Xiande's face showed a look of anxiety. He struggled to raise his left hand, which he had not used since entering the hospital, and with trembling fingers, he gently touched the portrait of Chairman Mao, gazing at it with boundless affection. The nurse turned the page, and he turned it back, his eyes filled with joy as he gazed at the great leader Chairman Mao's portrait for a long time.

A few days later, Mei Xiande was out of danger. However, he was still not fully conscious and could not speak, only able to utter a few single syllables. The nurse gave him a pen and a piece of paper, hoping to understand his thinking. He stared at the blank paper for a while, then struggled to write with his uncooperative left hand. Each character he wrote caused beads of sweat to form on his forehead. The nurse wiped his sweat while watching what he was writing. One character, two characters, and soon the paper was filled with the shining words "Long Live Chairman Mao."

These were not ordinary words. These five characters contained all of Mei Xiande's boundless loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao.

When everyone present praised him for writing well, Mei Xiande clearly spoke three connected words with his pure voice: "Chairman Mao."

Yes, it was the great leader Chairman Mao who gave Mei Xiande a second life. The great image and brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao awakened his consciousness, bringing him out of his coma and restoring his thinking. The great leader Chairman Mao brought back the smile to his face and the loud song to his voice. Since being injured and hospitalized:

* His first facial expression was when he saw a portrait of Chairman Mao;
* His first voluntary limb movement was when he touched the portrait of Chairman Mao;
* His first smile was when he heard "Long Live Chairman Mao";
* His first written words were "Long Live Chairman Mao";
* His first three connected words were "Chairman Mao";
* His first song he sang alone was "The East is Red."

"Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao is our dearest person. In the early months of his hospitalization, the medical staff recorded "consciousness blurred," "thoughts disordered," "memory loss," and "speech delayed" in Mei Xiande's nursing diary. He had forgotten everything from the past. However, the great leader Chairman Mao, he never forgot. Even in a state of blurred consciousness, if you asked him who is the great leader of all the nationalities, he could immediately answer clearly: "Chairman Mao."

His boat captain, squad leader, and comrades came to visit him, his father, mother, and brother came to visit him, but he did not recognize them. It was not until last April that he still mistook his father for the boat captain. However, since the day he woke up from his coma, whenever he saw a portrait of Chairman Mao, he could immediately recognize it. He never made a mistake. Every time he saw it, he would greet it with utmost respect and affection: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao is the savior of the Chinese people. It was Chairman Mao who turned dark China into a bright China. Mei Xiande's family, along with billions of laboring people, transformed from slaves into masters. The great Mao Zedong Thought nurtured him, helping him grow from an ordinary fisherman into a revolutionary soldier of the proletariat. With deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, Mei Xiande eagerly studied Chairman Mao's works. Reading Chairman Mao's books became his first need in life.

When he had just recovered from his coma and could not speak or move, he eagerly asked the nurse to read him Chairman Mao's quotations several times. Sometimes, while reading, he would fall into a coma again, and the nurse would stop. But as soon as he woke up and did not hear Chairman Mao's voice, he would stare intently at the nurse, making "eh, eh" sounds, asking the nurse to continue reading.

When he could sit up, with the bullet fragment still not removed from his skull and his right limb still paralyzed, he would lean on the table and insist on copying Chairman Mao's quotations with his left hand for one or two hours a day. He never missed a day. There were times when he did not copy on time because he was meeting with revolutionary masses, and after going to bed, he would suddenly remember and get up to copy. When he could walk, he would take "Chairman Mao's Quotations" with him wherever he went, learning and using them wherever he went. Once, the nurse saw him anxiously looking for something, searching from the bed to the cabinet, turning in circles. The nurse thought something was wrong, but later, through gestures and words, she found out that it was his "Chairman Mao's Quotations" that he couldn't find. For Mei Xiande, this was more serious than a "first-class accident." He was so anxious that he didn't eat or do anything else. It was only after finding it in his coat pocket that he sighed in relief and smiled contentedly.

Mei Xiande's memory was severely damaged, making his studies extremely difficult. Vice Chairman Lin Biao called for pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and Mei Xiande actively responded, resolutely implementing it. Several times at night, the medical staff woke up to see him sitting alone at the table, holding the "Three Articles" (Serve the People, In Memory of Norman Bethune, and The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains), reading them intently. With the greatest enthusiasm and incredible willpower, he overcame numerous difficulties in his studies. Although he still spoke with difficulty, he could recite the "Three Articles" relatively fluently, recite more than fifty quotations from Chairman Mao, and sing more than thirty songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and poems.

Loving Chairman Mao and loving Chairman Mao's works became the red thread running through Mei Xiande's entire life. If he found someone's quotation book was damaged, he would silently help fix it. If he found the characters on the quotation board were falling off, he would bring a table and chair, climb up, and fix it. In the courtyard, there were eight movable quotation boards of Chairman Mao, each weighing more than twenty pounds. Every time it rained, Mei Xiande would drag his not yet fully recovered paralyzed limbs, hobble out in the rain, and help his comrades move them into the house one by one. Whenever he went for a walk and it rained, he would tightly hug "Chairman Mao's Quotations" to his chest, using his entire body to protect it.

For every proletarian revolutionary soldier, the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental stance and direction. In this regard, comrade Mei Xiande has set a shining example for us.

In Mei Xiande's heart, the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought are forever the reddest red sun.

Mei Xiande Follows Chairman Mao's Words Closely

Anyone who has been in close contact with comrade Mei Xiande will have a distinct feeling: Mei Xiande follows Chairman Mao's words the most. He follows Chairman Mao's words word for word and sentence for sentence. Chairman Mao's words become an immense spiritual force within him.

People still remember: In the midst of the fierce "August 6" naval battle, a shell fragment hit Mei Xiande's right forehead, piercing into his left frontal lobe. He immediately lost consciousness. His comrades bandaged him and helped him lie down. In an instant, he stood up again like an iron man. His brain nerves had been severely damaged, and cerebrospinal fluid was leaking out. However, he pointed to a quotation from Chairman Mao on the bulkhead: "This army possesses an indomitable spirit. It will trample down all enemies and will never be subdued by any enemy. No matter how difficult and painful the situation, as long as there is one person left, that person must continue to fight." Chairman Mao's teachings created a miracle in him: He, with blood streaming down his head, operated and checked the machinery without stopping for three hours; He, in a semi-comatose state, found a loose screw from dozens of pipes and thousands of screws, and tightened it with a wrench.

From the battlefield to the hospital, in his struggle against severe injuries, Mei Xiande was still the most obedient to Chairman Mao's words. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought forged an unyielding revolutionary backbone within him.

Mei Xiande underwent five surgeries on his head, the last of which involved opening his skull to remove the bullet fragment from his left frontal lobe. The night before the surgery, he repeatedly studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." The nurse asked him what thoughts he would use to face the surgery? He responded loudly and cheerfully: "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." Three days after the surgery, a three-centimeter-long, matchstick-thick needle had to be inserted into the wound to drain the accumulated fluid. This was extremely painful, and the medical staff was concerned that he might not be able to endure it. However, Mei Xiande was very calm. For half an hour, he clenched his fists and gritted his teeth, enduring the excruciating pain. Beads of sweat fell, and his entire body was soaked with sweat, but he did not utter a single word of pain.

Treatment was one challenge, and rehabilitation was another. At first, Mei Xiande's right half of the body was completely paralyzed, and he could only lie in bed and be at the mercy of others. For a warrior who was used to fighting, this was unbearable. He asked the nurse to tie a rope on the bedhead, and he grabbed it with his left hand, struggling to sit up. As soon as he lifted his body, the wound on his head immediately split open, and the nerves and joints all ached together. His body immediately softened and fell back, and he fainted. The first attempt failed. When he woke up, he saw the shining quotation from Chairman Mao, just like in the fierce naval battle, seeing Chairman Mao's quotation and hearing Chairman Mao's voice, instantly igniting boundless courage within him. He launched another attack. With the help of the medical staff, after numerous stubborn exercises, he finally managed to get out of bed.

From getting out of bed to walking, it was another arduous battle. The paralyzed right leg was like a wooden stick, heavy and painful, and he could only drag it along with his uncoordinated left leg. The brave Mei Xiande, who was an iron man in the face of the enemy, was a steadfast warrior in the face of injury. He resolutely let go of the nurse's support, grabbing the bed, wall, and window sill, struggling step by step, circling and practicing. When the pain was unbearable and he was exhausted, he used Chairman Mao's words to encourage himself. Following Chairman Mao's words, all enemies can be defeated! Following Chairman Mao's words, all difficulties can be overcome! Following Chairman Mao's words is victory, this is a great truth that applies everywhere. Mei Xiande, after eight days of hard practice, could walk independently to the physiotherapy room fifty meters away from the ward. After another fourteen days of practice, his paralyzed limbs had basically recovered their function. The physiotherapy technician admired: "I have never seen a hemiplegic patient recover so quickly." This is a miracle created by Mao Zedong Thought!

Mei Xiande followed Chairman Mao's words in everything. Acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions had become a habit, a reflex for him. Chairman Mao's words were the highest authority in his mind. Sometimes, when his symptoms acted up, his nerves were excited, and he often refused to take medicine, refused injections, refused to get out of bed, and refused to eat, not listening to anyone. At this time, as long as you took out "Chairman Mao's Quotations," he would obediently sit down; you read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations, he would listen respectfully like a student, you asked him if he would follow Chairman Mao's words? He would nod repeatedly, doing whatever you asked. The nursing team understood this "rule" and often used Chairman Mao's words to solve some difficult problems.

Once, Mei Xiande refused to eat again, and no amount of persuasion worked. The nurse then read a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations with him: "Even after the victory of the whole country, during the historical period when classes have not been eliminated within the country and imperialist systems still exist in the world, our army is still a fighting army." When he read to here, Mei Xiande immediately responded loudly: "Forever a fighting army!" The nurse smiled and said: "Good, little Mei, you are a soldier, you follow Chairman Mao's words the most. You always want to return to the front line, right? How can you fight without eating?" Mei Xiande immediately nodded: "I will eat, I will eat." The nurse encouraged him: "Now you eat one steamed bun, it's like defeating one American devil!" Mei Xiande immediately responded loudly: "Eat one steamed bun, defeat one American devil! Ready—fire!" He indeed ate heartily.

Mei Xiande was in the ward but his heart was on the front line. Chairman Mao's teachings that "the People's Liberation Army is forever a fighting army" were deeply rooted in his mind. He was very concerned about the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialist aggression. When he saw in a movie that American devils were slaughtering the Vietnamese people, he stood up and shouted: "Fight! Definitely fight!" When he saw news of American bandits invading our territorial waters and airspace, he clenched his fists in anger, making a gesture of starting the ship, and shouted "Destroy the enemy!" Every time an enemy plane was shot down, he was overjoyed, holding the newspaper, and rushed to tell people: "The American devil has been beaten down!" Leaders and comrades came to visit him, and he repeatedly asked to return to the ship, to return to the front line. Seeing some comrades discharged, he was very envious, asking the doctor to discharge him. He had a high sense of enemy awareness, even in a state of coma or semi-coma, his mind was filled with the enemy, never forgetting the battle.

Once, he was in a semi-comatose state again. At night, the nurse took off his socks and placed them under the mattress, and he shook his head. The nurse placed them on the bedside, and he shook his head again. When they were placed on the chair, he still shook his head. The nurse was at a loss. Later, it was a comrade who guessed his meaning, according to the requirements of life on the ship, placed his socks in his shoes, neatly arranged at the foot of the bed, and he smiled contentedly.

Following Chairman Mao's words closely and resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions is Mei Xiande's most precious quality, his most fundamental characteristic, and also the inexhaustible source of his proletarian revolutionary spirit and revolutionary optimism.

Mei Xiande Fights Alongside Us

Mei Xiande, in his fight against armed enemies, is indeed an iron warrior, and in his fight against unarmed enemies, he is also an unyielding warrior loyal to Chairman Mao.

The storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution swept across the nation, shaking the world. Although Mei Xiande was seriously injured in the head and hospitalized, his heart was closely connected with the revolutionary masses across the nation. He responded with great enthusiasm to Chairman Mao's great call: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" He treated the hospital as a battlefield and actively participated in this new struggle.

During the nationwide Red Guard revolutionary tour, tens of thousands of revolutionary youngsters all wanted to see Mei Xiande. At that time, his wounds were still in the process of treatment, and his comrades were concerned that his body might not be able to withstand it. However, as soon as he heard about this, he eagerly expressed: "I want to see them, I want to see them!" Those days, no matter how painful his wounds were, how tired his spirit was, how little he ate, how poorly he slept, as soon as he heard that the Red Guards had come, he immediately became spirited and ran out with a smile. In more than a year, Mei Xiande met with more than twenty thousand revolutionary youngsters. Each time he met them, he would excitedly raise both arms and shout to the revolutionary youngsters: "You're doing the right thing, you're doing well!" Every time he heard the live broadcast of Chairman Mao reviewing the Red Guards, he would shout with the revolutionary youngsters: "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

Due to his limited ability to speak, he could only say a few words or a few sentences, but these short words and sentences fully expressed his deep class feelings for Chairman Mao, for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and for the Red Guards led by Chairman Mao. The revolutionary youngsters were all moved by his high revolutionary enthusiasm, and they happily said: "Comrade Mei Xiande is in our ranks, he is fighting alongside us!"

In Mei Xiande's mind, there is a very clear principle: those who support Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, he loves and supports; those who oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, he hates and detests. In the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, he is clear-cut and unhesitating. Even in a state of illness and confusion, his proletarian stance and proletarian feelings were still very clear and strong. After the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party were exposed, whenever these bastards were mentioned, he would glare with wide-open eyes, gnashing his teeth, and gesturing, as if he wanted to grab them and smash them to pieces. One day, he saw a book titled "Cultivation" on the table and angrily said: "What do you want this bad thing for!" He grabbed it and threw it into the corner. When flipping through old photos given to him by others, he found photos of Liu Shaoqi and the counter-revolutionary two-faced traitor Tao Zhu, and he immediately flew into a rage, pointing at these photos and cursing: "Dare to oppose Chairman Mao! Get out of here!" Saying this, he tore them to pieces and threw them into the trash can.

Mei Xiande deeply understood: Liu Shaoqi and his gang were trying to restore capitalism in China, which would push the laboring people back into the fire pit. Mei Xiande would never forget the past. In the hospital, sometimes when his symptoms acted up and he didn't want to eat good food, he would definitely participate in the "bitter meal" and eat two or three bowls.

As early as last May, when his injuries had just improved and there was still a bullet fragment in his head, he used his still uncoordinated left hand to angrily write the first big-character poster "Down with the Deng Tuo clique." In more than a year, with the help of his comrades, he wrote more than thirty big-character posters and critical articles, each one filled with his boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao and burning hatred for the enemy. Sometimes, when his body was not feeling well, writing a single character required a lot of effort, with sweat on his forehead and trembling hands, others advised him to rest, but he refused. He treated each character as a bullet, and each time he participated in a criticism meeting, he treated it as a battle. He wrote in his notebook: "Resolutely expose the top handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, thoroughly criticize and thoroughly defeat them! Resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end! Forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!" This is his battle oath.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Mei Xiande closely followed Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. Whatever went against Chairman Mao's instructions, he firmly opposed. Once, there was a physical confrontation in a nearby unit. He, disregarding danger, immediately ran to the scene and shouted loudly: "Chairman Mao instructs us to have ideological struggle, not physical confrontation! This is not good!" The medical staff, upon hearing the news, repeatedly persuaded him to return. Before leaving, he still turned back several times and shouted: "Have ideological struggle, not physical confrontation!"

In the stormy Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comrade Mei Xiande, with his fighting practice, proved that he was indeed a revolutionary soldier nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. His heart, loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, shone even brighter after this class struggle!

Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism, Forever Be a Good Soldier of Chairman Mao

After Mei Xiande was injured, our great leader Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin showed him great concern, and the people of the nation gave him high honors. During his hospitalization, visitors came one after another, and letters and gifts of sympathy arrived every day. Praises and commendations, the slogan "Learn from Mei Xiande," continuously reached his ears.

For a young soldier, this was a new and severe test.

Once, Mei Xiande was invited to attend a meeting. Before the meeting, the doctor asked him what he wanted to say? Although his injuries had just improved and he spoke with difficulty, he still replied word by word: "Learn from the meeting. Always improve, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao." And he wrote the words "be a good soldier of Chairman Mao" on a piece of paper, preparing to present it to the meeting. Some comrades suggested he add the words "forever" before this sentence, and he did so. However, after a while, he thought about it and took up the pen again, changing the words "forever" to "strive."

Striving to be a good soldier of Chairman Mao, this is comrade Mei Xiande's fundamental attitude towards honors and towards himself.

Chairman Mao said: "We should be modest, prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and wholeheartedly serve the people of China..." Mei Xiande moved to whichever ward he was in, he brought this quotation with him. He took Chairman Mao's teachings as his motto. Unlike those who, after doing something and achieving some results, become arrogant and proud, unlike those who love to show off and reveal their sharp edges, unlike those who put "I" in front of everything, Mei Xiande was a very modest person, a sincere person.

When talking about honors and achievements, he always attributed them to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the Party and the people, to the collective.

When he was praised at a meeting, he would always raise his arms and shout: "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

When he saw performances, movies, and slide shows that praised his deeds, he would always lower his head in embarrassment.

When he heard broadcasts praising him in articles and songs, he would always quietly slip away.

Mei Xiande could not express his thoughts with many words, and his most frequently used two phrases were "don't, don't" and "not enough, not enough."

Whenever someone talked about his personal matters, he would quickly shake his hand: "Don't, don't!" Once, he donated two baskets of eggs given to him by others to the people of the Tangshan disaster area, and the nurse wrote his name on the letter. As soon as he found out, he immediately crossed it out with a pen, angrily saying: "Don't, don't!" Another time, when he heard a comrade sing a song praising him, "The Sunflower Turns to the Sun," he was so anxious that he repeatedly said "don't, don't!" and chased after the comrade, insisting that he promise not to sing this song again before he would stop.

When he was praised and complimented, he would always blush and sincerely say: "Not enough, not enough!" In the "August 6" naval battle, he was seriously injured in the head, with cerebrospinal fluid leaking out, but he still insisted on fighting. However, when people talked about this and expressed their desire to learn from him, he would always sit restlessly and say: "Not enough, not enough!"

In Mei Xiande's view: for personal matters, not a bit should be taken, not even half a bit; for public matters, there is never enough, not even in a lifetime.

A "don't" and a "not enough," these four simple words fully expressed Mei Xiande's thorough self-criticism and selfless spirit, and the spiritual realm of communism.

In the hospital, Mei Xiande was a severely injured patient, but he often forgot that he was a patient. He treated the hospital as a new battlefield for serving the people, showing extreme enthusiasm for his comrades and the collective.

He could barely move, and his hands and feet were still very uncoordinated, but he often hobbled to help the nursing staff with labor, folding gauze, wiping doors and windows, wiping tables and chairs, emptying spittoons, doing everything. Seeing some severely injured comrades needed to use the toilet, he would quickly go over to support them, using his just-moving left hand to help these comrades unbutton and button their pants. Seeing some paralyzed comrades who couldn't move, he would go over to help them cover their blankets and turn over.

When his body improved, he voluntarily took on work. He was assigned to manage the recreational room and cultural and sports equipment with two comrades, and he would clean the recreational room every day, making it clean and tidy. One night, when checking the cultural and sports equipment, he found a missing chess set, and he searched from floor to floor, room to room, until he found it before going to rest.

His brain nerves were severely damaged, and he often forgot many things. Sometimes, just after eating, he would forget what he ate. However, his love for the collective's interests was so meticulous and heartfelt. He himself was not convenient, moving a chair would be light and careful. If someone moved it heavily, he would say: "Not good!" Once, he went to the toilet, and after a long time, he didn't come out. The nurse went in and saw him tilting his head, listening intently to something. The nurse listened with him and only then heard the sound of dripping water. He checked all the faucets, his shirt was soaked with sweat, but he still didn't want to rest. It was only after confirming that the sound was from the upstairs drainpipe that he walked away contentedly.

In the hospital, Mei Xiande was both a recuperating patient and an unspecialized nurse, a responsible caretaker, a vigorous fighter, and an unyielding propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought. He was selfless in everything, always putting the collective first; he was selfless, always putting others first. People praised him: "From comrade Mei Xiande, one can read the living 'Three Articles'."

However, comrade Mei Xiande's response was still: "Not enough, not enough!" He loved to recite two sentences from Chairman Mao: "Pay more attention to the Party and the masses than to oneself, and pay more attention to others than to oneself." He often used these two sentences to urge and examine himself, using the spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people to strictly demand of himself.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, comrade Mei Xiande was the most enthusiastic and resolute in responding and implementing it. He said: "Against the enemy in one's thoughts, one must be like against the American devils, bang bang bang, shoot it down!" He decided to follow Chairman Mao's latest instructions, to be more conscious and more strict with himself, to thoroughly fight selfishness and be selfless, to advance on the path of ideological transformation.

Vice Chairman Lin called on us: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, be a good soldier of Chairman Mao."

Comrade Mei Xiande, with his fighting practice, most resolutely and faithfully implemented Vice Chairman Lin's instructions. In him, the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shines, showing the new spiritual face of a new generation of communists.

### 麦贤得最听毛主席的话

专栏：

    麦贤得最听毛主席的话
    在“八·六”海战中头部负重伤仍坚持战斗、荣获战斗英雄称号的麦贤得同志，入院治疗两年多了。在治疗期间，麦贤得受到我们伟大统帅毛主席、副统帅林彪同志的亲切关怀，受到全国广大人民的热情慰问。成千上万的红卫兵小将和革命群众，从祖国的四面八方给他写信。人们关切地问：麦贤得同志现在怎么样了？他的创伤痊愈了吗？身体复原了吗？在当前这一场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，在斗私批修的战场上，他为人民立了什么功？在思想革命化道路上，他有什么新的进步？
    我们的麦贤得同志，没有辜负毛主席、林副主席和全国人民的关怀和期望。他紧跟毛主席英明教导，紧跟全国人民的革命步伐，一直在战斗，在前进！最近光荣地被他所在的部队和医疗单位选为学习毛主席著作积极分子，选为出席海军首次学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表。在两年的战斗历程中，麦贤得同志以他的英雄模范事迹，又谱出了一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲
    麦贤得，这个贫苦渔民的儿子，对毛主席的感情比山还高，比海还深。敌人的炮弹伤损了他的肉体，破坏了他的思维能力，却损坏不了他对毛主席无限忠诚、无限热爱的一颗红心。
    刚刚入院的时候，麦贤得除了心脏还跳动，整个肢体都失去了活动能力，长期处于昏迷或半昏迷状态。水放到唇边不知道喝，软食放在嘴里不会咽。不管怎么呼唤，他都没有一点反应，无论什么事物，也引不起他任何表情。护理小组的同志熬红了眼睛，人们焦急地盼望着他恢复神智。
    有一天，麦贤得又一次从昏迷中醒过来，睁着一双迟滞的眼睛，一动不动地望着天花板。护士为了试验他有没有反应，拿来一本画报给他看。一页一页地翻过去了，麦贤得的面部没有任何反应。翻着翻着，细心的护士忽然看见他的嘴角微微抽动了一下，好象要说话又说不出。这时护士才发现，麦贤得的眼睛，直盯盯地看着画页上一幅毛主席的像。当护士继续往下翻的时候，麦贤得的脸上又出现了焦急的表情。他艰难地抬起那只入院后一直没有用过的左手，吃力地抓住画页，重新翻回来，用颤抖的手指轻轻地抚摸着毛主席的像，无限深情地看了又看。护士翻过去，他又翻过来，眼睛里流露着欢乐的神情，对着伟大领袖毛主席的像，一直看了很久很久。
    过了几天，麦贤得脱离了危险期。但是仍然神智不清，不能讲话，只能发出一两个单音。护士给他一支笔，放了一张纸，想了解一下他的思维能力。他对着白纸想了一会，用不听使唤的左手，非常吃力地一笔一笔写起来。他每写一个字，头上都要冒出汗珠。护士一面替他擦汗，一面注视着他写些什么字。一个字写好了，两个字写好了，不一会纸上出现了“毛主席万岁”五个金光闪闪的大字。
    这不是平常的字。这五个字里，凝结了麦贤得同志无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的全部心血。
    当在场的人一齐称赞他写得好的时候，麦贤得用他那纯朴的声音清晰地说出三个连贯的字：“毛主席”。
    是啊！正是伟大领袖毛主席，给了麦贤得第二次生命。毛主席的伟大形象和光辉思想，唤起了他的知觉，使他从昏迷中清醒过来，恢复了思维活动。伟大领袖毛主席，使他面部重新出现笑容，重新唱出响亮的歌声。自从负伤住院以后：
    他第一次有面部表情是看到了毛主席像；
    他第一次自觉的肢体动作是抚摸毛主席像；
    他第一次有笑容是听到喊“毛主席万岁”；
    他第一次写的字是“毛主席万岁”；
    他第一次连续说出的三个字是“毛主席”；
    他第一次独自唱的一首歌是《东方红》。
      “爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲！”毛主席是我们最亲最亲的人。在医院初期的几个月里，医务人员在麦贤得的护理日记上，记满了“意识朦胧”、“思维紊乱”、
  “记忆不清”、“发声迟钝”等字样。过去的事情他完全忘记了。但是，伟大领袖毛主席，他却始终铭记不忘。即使在意识朦胧的状态，你若问他谁是我们各族人民的伟大领袖？他也能立即清楚地回答：“毛主席”。
    他的艇长、班长和战友们来看望他，他的父亲、母亲和哥哥来看望他，他都不认识了。直到去年四月，他还把父亲错认为艇长。但是，自从他从昏迷中醒过来那一天开始，只要看到毛主席像，他总是马上就能认出来。从来没有认错过。他每看见一次，总是以万分崇敬的心情，亲切地轻声地欢呼：“毛主席，毛主席！”
    毛主席是中国人民的大救星。是毛主席把黑暗的中国变成光明的中国。麦贤得的一家，同亿万劳动人民一道，从奴隶变成主人。伟大的毛泽东思想哺育着他，使他很快从一个普通渔民成长为无产阶级的革命战士。怀着对毛主席的无限深厚的阶级感情，麦贤得如饥似渴地努力学习毛主席著作。读毛主席的书，成了他生活的第一需要。
    当他刚刚从昏迷中清醒过来，还不能说话，不能动弹的时候，就迫不及待地几次向护士示意，要求给他读毛主席语录。有时候，读着读着，他又昏迷过去了，护士就停了下来。但是，只要他一醒过来，听不到毛主席的声音，立刻就紧紧地盯住护士，嘴里发出
  “咦、咦”的声音，要求护士继续读下去。
    当他刚刚能够坐起来，颅内弹片还未摘除，右肢瘫痪还未恢复的时候，他就斜依在桌子上，坚持用左手抄写毛主席语录，一抄就是一两个小时。天天如此，从来没有间断过。有几次因为接见革命群众没有按时抄写，晚上已经睡下了，忽然想起来，马上爬起来补抄。
    当他能够下床走动以后，他走到哪里，就把《毛主席语录》带到哪里，学到哪里，用到哪里。有一次，护士看见他神情紧张地在找什么，从床上翻到柜里，急得团团转。护士以为出了什么问题，后来，听他连说带比划才知道是《毛主席语录》找不到了。对麦贤得来说，这是比“一等事故”还要严重的事故。他急得饭也不吃了，啥事都不干了。一直到从棉衣口袋里找到了，他才双手捧住，长嘘了一口气，满意地笑起来。
    麦贤得的记忆能力受到严重破坏，这给他的学习带来极大的困难。林彪副主席号召把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段，麦贤得积极响应，坚决贯彻。好几次夜里，卫生员一觉醒来，看见他独自坐在桌前，捧着“老三篇”，正在专心致意地读。他以最大的热情和惊人的毅力，克服了学习上的重重困难。现在，尽管他说话还很吃力，但是，他却能够比较流畅地背诵“老三篇”，背五十多条毛主席语录，还会唱三十多首毛主席语录歌和毛主席诗词歌。
    热爱毛主席，热爱毛主席著作，成为贯串麦贤得全部生活的一根红线。发现谁的语录本坏了，他就一声不响地帮助贴好；发现语录牌上的字脱落了，他就搬来桌子、椅子，吃力地爬上去贴好。院子里有八块活动的毛主席语录板，每块重二十多斤。每次下雨，麦贤得总是拖着尚未完全恢复的偏瘫肢体，一拐一拐地冒雨跑出去，和同志们一起一块一块地搬到屋里。每当散步的时候，赶上下雨，他总是把《毛主席语录》紧紧地抱在胸前，用整个身体保护着它。
    对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的态度，是每一个无产阶级革命战士的根本立场、根本方向问题。在这个问题上，麦贤得同志为我们树立了一个光辉的榜样。
    在麦贤得同志心里，伟大的领袖毛主席，光焰无际的毛泽东思想，永远是最红最红的红太阳。
    毛主席的话句句照办
    凡是经常和麦贤得同志接触的人，都有一个突出的感觉：麦贤得最听毛主席的话。毛主席的话，他字字照办、句句照办。毛主席的话，在他身上化为无比巨大的精神力量。
    人们还记得：在炮火纷飞的“八·六”海战中，一块弹片打进麦贤得的右前额，直插到左额叶。他顿时失去了知觉。战友们替他包扎扶他躺下。一转眼，他又象铁人似地站了起来。他的脑神经已经遭到严重破坏，脑脊液都流出来了。但是，他却指了指舱壁上的一条毛主席语录：“这个军队具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服。不论在任何艰难困苦的场合，只要还有一个人，这个人就要继续战斗下去。”毛主席的教导，在他身上产生了奇迹：他竟然带着满头鲜血，一刻不停地操纵、检查着机器，坚持战斗达三小时之久；他竟然在半昏迷的状态中，从几十条管路上千个螺丝钉里，摸到了一颗松动的螺丝钉，用扳子把它拧紧。
    从战场到医院，在同严重的创伤作斗争的时候，麦贤得同样是最听毛主席的话。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，铸成他一副无产阶级的革命硬骨头。
    麦贤得的头部先后动了五次手术，最后一次要揭开颅骨，取出左额叶里的弹片。手术前夕，他一次又一次地学习《愚公移山》。护士问他用什么思想迎接开刀？他爽朗地高声回答：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”手术后的第三天，要用三厘米长、火柴棒粗的针插进伤口，抽出积液。这是非常痛苦的，医护人员担心他受不住。但是，麦贤得同志却很坦然。整整半小时里，他紧握双手、咬紧牙关，忍受着剧痛。豆大的汗珠往下掉，全身被汗水湿透了，他也没有说一声痛。
    治疗是一关，锻炼又是一关。一开始，麦贤得的右半个肢体完全瘫痪，只能躺在床上听人摆布。对一个过惯战斗生活的战士说来，这是无法忍受的。他让护士在床头拴根带子，自己用左手抓住带子，使劲地起坐。刚刚抬起身子，头部创伤立刻破裂似的剧痛，神经、关节都一齐痛了起来。他的身体一下子就软塌下去了，人也昏过去了。第一次进攻失败了。当他醒过来的时候，抬头看见金光闪闪的毛主席语录，就象在激烈的海战中，看见了毛主席语录，听到了毛主席的声音，顿时激发了无限的勇气。他又一次发动进攻了。在医护人员的帮助下，经历了多次顽强锻炼，他终于能够从床上走下地来。
    从起床到走路的锻炼，又是一场艰苦的战斗。瘫痪了的右腿就象条木棍子一样，又重又痛，只能用不灵活的左腿拖着走。勇敢的麦贤得，在敌人面前是钢铁英雄，在创伤面前是坚强战士。他毅然甩开护士的搀扶，自己抓住床沿、墙壁和窗台，艰难地一步一步地走，一圈一圈地练。痛极了，累极了，支持不住了，他就用毛主席的话来激励自己。听毛主席的话，一切敌人都能打败！听毛主席的话，一切困难都能征服！听毛主席的话就是胜利，这是一个放之四海而皆准的伟大真理。麦贤得经过了八天苦练，就能独立地走到离病房五十米的体疗室了。又经过了十四天的锻炼，他的偏瘫的肢体，就基本上恢复了功能。体疗技师敬佩地说：“从来没有见过偏瘫病人能够这样快的恢复功能。”这是毛泽东思想创造的奇迹！
    麦贤得事事处处都听毛主席的话。按毛主席的指示办事，几乎成了他的一种习惯，一种本能。毛主席的话是他头脑里的最高权威。有时候，他的病症发作，神经兴奋，常常不肯吃药，不肯打针，不肯起床，不肯吃饭，谁的话也听不进去。这时候，只要你掏出《毛主席语录》，他就顺从地坐了下来；你给他念一段毛主席语录，他就象小学生似地恭恭敬敬地听着，你问他听不听毛主席的话？他就连连点头，叫干什么就干什么。护理小组的同志掌握了他这个“规律”，就常常用毛主席的话来解决一些难以解决的问题。
    有一次，麦贤得又不肯吃饭了，怎样劝说也不听。护士就和他一起学了毛主席的一段语录：“就是在全国胜利以后，在国内没有消灭阶级和世界上存在着帝国主义制度的历史时期内，我们的军队还是一个战斗队。”念到这里，麦贤得马上响亮地接着说：“永远是一个战斗队！”护士笑着说：“好，小麦，你是个战士，最听毛主席的话。你不是时刻都想重返前线吗？不吃饭怎么能养好身体参加战斗呢？”麦贤得立刻点头：“我吃，我吃。”护士又鼓励他说：“现在你吃一个馒头，就等于消灭一个美国鬼子！”麦贤得马上高声回答：“吃一个馒头，等于消灭一个美国鬼子！预备——放！”果然就大口大口地吃了起来。
    麦贤得身在病房，心在前线。毛主席关于“人民解放军永远是一个战斗队”的教导，在他脑子里深深扎了根。对世界各国人民反对美帝国主义侵略的斗争，他十分关心。在电影上看到美国鬼子屠杀越南人民，他就站起来喊：“打！坚决打！”看到美国强盗窜犯我国领海领空的消息，就愤怒地握紧拳头，作出开动舰艇的姿势，高喊“消灭敌人！”每次打下了敌机，他都高兴地拿着报纸，向人们奔告：“美国鬼，揍下来啦！”首长和战友们来看他，他总是再三再四地要求回到艇上去，回到前线去。看见有的战友出院了，他就非常羡慕，找医生要求出院。他有高度的敌情观念，即使在昏迷、半昏迷的状态中，他头脑里也装着敌人，念念不忘战斗。
    有一次，他又处于半昏迷状态。晚上护士替他脱了袜子，放到铺垫下，他看到了就摇头。护士给他放到床头，他又摇头。放到椅子上，他还是摇头。弄得护士不知如何是好了。后来，还是一个战友猜到了他的意思，按照艇上战斗生活的要求，把他的袜子放到鞋里，整整齐齐地摆在床前，他才满意地笑了。
    最听毛主席的话，坚决照毛主席的指示办事，这是麦贤得最可贵的品质，最根本的特点，也是他那无产阶级革命硬骨头精神和革命乐观主义精神的无尽的源泉。
    麦贤得和我们战斗在一起
    麦贤得在同拿枪的敌人战斗，不愧为钢铁战士，同不拿枪的敌人战斗，也不愧为忠于毛主席的无畏战士。
    无产阶级文化大革命的风暴席卷全国，震撼着全世界。麦贤得虽然头负重伤，身在医院，他的心却和全国无产阶级革命派紧紧地连在一起。他以极大的热情响应了毛主席的伟大号召：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”把医院当成战场，积极投入这场新的战斗。
    全国红卫兵革命大串连期间，成千上万的革命小将都想见见麦贤得。当时，他的创伤还正在治疗的过程中，同志们担心他的身体支持不住。但是，他一听说这件事，马上急切地表示：“要见，要见！”那些日子，无论他的伤口多么疼，精神多么疲劳，吃不下饭，睡不好觉，只要一听见红卫兵来了，他立刻精神振奋，满面笑容地跑出来。在一年多时间里，麦贤得先后会见了二十多万革命小将。每一次会见，他总是激动地高举双臂，对革命小将喊道：“干得对，干得好！”每次听到毛主席检阅红卫兵的实况录音，他就和革命小将一起欢呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    由于说话能力没有完全恢复，他只能简单地讲几句话、几个字，然而，这短短的几个字、几句话，却充分表达了他对毛主席，对毛主席的革命路线、对毛主席统帅的红卫兵无比深厚的阶级感情。革命小将都为他这种高度的革命热情所感动，他们高兴地说：“麦贤得同志就在我们的队伍里，他跟我们战斗在一起！”
    在麦贤得的思想上，有一条非常明确的原则：谁拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，他就爱，就支持；谁反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，他就满腔怒火，无比愤恨。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈搏斗中，他爱憎分明，毫不含糊。即使在病症发作、神智不清的朦胧状态，他的这种无产阶级立场和无产阶级感情，也表现得非常鲜明，非常强烈。党内最大的一小撮走资派被揪出来以后，只要一提起这些坏蛋，他就把眼睛瞪得溜圆，咬牙切齿，作着手势，恨不得一把揪住，砸他个稀巴烂。有一天，他看到桌子上放着一本《修养》，就气愤愤地说：“拿这个坏东西干什么！”随手抓起来狠狠地扔到墙角落里。在翻看过去别人送给他的照片的时候，发现有中国赫鲁晓夫和反革命两面派陶铸的照片，他立刻火冒三丈，指着这些照片骂道：“竟敢反对毛主席！滚他的蛋吧！”说着就把它扯得粉碎，丢到垃圾箱里去了。
    麦贤得深深懂得：中国赫鲁晓夫和他的一伙，妄图在中国复辟资本主义，就是要把劳动人民重新推到火坑里去。麦贤得永远不会忘记过去。在医院里，有时病态发作，再好的饭也不想吃。但是，每次吃“忆苦餐”，他却一定要参加，而且一吃就是两三碗。带着阶级苦，血泪仇，在战场上，他满怀仇恨杀敌人；在文化大革命中，他把全部仇恨都倾泻到党内一小撮走资派身上。
    早在去年五月，他的伤势刚刚好转，头部还留着一块弹片，他就用还不灵活的左手愤怒挥笔，写出了第一张“打倒邓拓黑帮”的大字报。一年多来，他在同志们的帮助下，先后写过三十多篇大字报和批判文章，每一篇都凝聚着对毛主席的无限忠诚，燃烧着对敌人的无比愤恨。有时候，他的身体情况不好，写一个字也要付出很大的力气，头上出汗手发抖，别人劝他歇一歇，他坚决不肯。他把每一个字都当成一颗子弹，把每一次参加批判大会，都当作是一次战斗。他在笔记本上写道：“坚决揪出党内最大的一小撮走资派，彻底批判、彻底打倒！坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”“永远跟着毛主席干革命！”这就是他的战斗誓言。
    在文化大革命中，麦贤得紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。凡是违反毛主席指示的，他就坚决反对。有一次，附近单位发生了武斗。他不顾危险，立刻跑到现场，大声疾呼：“毛主席指示，要文斗，不要武斗！”“你们这样，不好！”医护人员闻讯赶去，再三劝他回来。临离开时，他还几次回头高喊：“要文斗，不要武斗！”
    在无产阶级文化大革命的急风暴雨中，麦贤得同志以自己的战斗实践证明：他不愧是毛泽东思想哺育起来的无产阶级革命战士。他忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想的一颗红心，经过这场阶级斗争的大风雨，更加显得鲜红夺目！斗私批修，永远做毛主席的好战士
    麦贤得负伤以后，我们的伟大领袖毛主席和林副主席，给了他极大的关怀，全国人民给了他极高的荣誉。在他住院期间，看望他的人络绎不绝，慰问信、慰问品，每天收到很多。称赞和表扬的声音，“向麦贤得学习”的口号，不断地送到他的耳边。
    对于一个年轻的战士，这是一种新的严峻的考验。
    有一次，麦贤得应邀参加一次大会。会前，医生问他有什么表示？尽管当时他的伤势刚刚好转，说话还很吃力，他还是一字一句地回答说：“向大会学习。天天向上，做毛主席的好战士。”并且把“做毛主席的好战士”这句话写在纸上，准备献给大会。有的同志建议他在这句话前面加上“永远”两个字，他照办了。然而，过了一会，他想了想，又拿起笔来，把“永远”两个字改成“努力”。
    努力做毛主席的好战士，这就是麦贤得同志对待荣誉、对待自己的根本态度。
    毛主席说：“我们应该谦虚，谨慎，戒骄，戒躁，全心全意地为中国人民服务，……”麦贤得搬到那个病房，就把这条语录带到那个病房。他把毛主席的这一教导当作自己的座右铭。和那些做了点事情，有了点成绩，就飘飘然、翘尾巴的人完全相反，和那种爱出风头，锋芒毕露的人完全相反，和那种事事处处把“我”字放在前头的人完全相反，麦贤得同志是个非常谦虚的人，老老实实的人。
    谈到荣誉，谈到成绩，他总是把荣誉和成绩归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于党和人民，归功于集体。
    当他在会上受到赞扬的时候，他总是振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    当他看到宣扬自己事迹的演出和电影、幻灯的时候，他总是不好意思地低着头。
    当他听到广播表扬自己的文章和歌曲的时候，他总是不声不响地悄悄走开。
    麦贤得还不能用很多语言表达自己的意思，他最常用的两句口头语，就是“不要，不要”和“不够，不够”。
    凡是说到他个人的事，他总是急急地摇手：“不要，不要！”有一次，他把别人慰问他的两筐鸡蛋转送给邢台灾区人民，护士在信上写了他的名字。他一发现，马上用笔划去，生气地说：“不要，不要！”又有一次，听到一个同志唱歌颂他的《葵花向太阳》这支歌，他急得什么似的，连说“不要，不要！”并且追着这个同志，非要他保证以后不再唱这支歌才罢。
    遇到表扬他称赞他的时候，他总是腼腆而又诚恳地说：“不够，不够！”“八·六”海战中，他头负重伤，脑脊液外流，还坚持战斗，真可以说是为人民“肝脑涂地”。但是，当人们谈起这件事，表示要向他学习的时候，他总是坐立不安地说：“不够，不够！”
    在麦贤得看来：为私的事，一点也不要，半点也不能要；为公的事，永远没有够，一辈子也不够。
    一个“不要”，一个“不够”，简单的四个字，充分表达了麦贤得同志彻底斗私，一心为公的崇高品质和共产主义的精神境界。
    在医院里，麦贤得是个重伤员，但是，他却常常忘记自己是个病人。他把医院当成为人民服务的新战场，表现了对同志、对集体的极端热忱。
    他自己刚刚能够活动，手脚还很不灵便，就常常一拐一拐地去帮助护理人员劳动，叠纱布、擦门窗、抹桌椅、倒痰盂，什么都干。看见有的重伤员要上厕所，就赶紧过去搀扶，用自己刚能活动的左手，帮助这些同志解裤带、系裤带。看见有的瘫痪人不能动弹，就去帮助这些同志盖被子、翻身。
    他的身体好了一些，就主动要求工作。分配他和两个同志管理娱乐室和文娱体育器材，他就每天把娱乐室打扫得干干净净，收拾得整整齐齐。有一次晚上检查文娱器材，发现少了一副象棋，他楼上楼下，跑遍各个病房，直到找回来才去休息。
    他的脑神经受到严重破坏，很多事情都记不清，有时候刚吃过饭，就忘记吃的什么。但是，他对集体利益的爱护却是那么细致，那么用心。他自己手脚不便，搬个椅子都要轻拿轻放。别人要是放重了些，他就说：“不好！”有一次，他上厕所，半天没出来。护士进去，看见他侧着头，全神贯注地在听什么。护士跟着他听，才听出有滴哒滴哒的水声。他把所有水龙头都检查了一遍，汗衫都湿透了，还不肯休息。直到查清楚是楼上下水管道里的声音，他才放心地走开。
    在医院里，麦贤得既是休养员，又是一个不分科室的护理员，一个热情负责的保管员，一个斗志旺盛的战斗员，一个无限忠诚的毛泽东思想宣传员。他处处为公，事事为公；毫不利己，专门利人。人们称赞他说：“从麦贤得同志身上，可以读到活的‘老三篇’。”
    然而，麦贤得同志自己的回答，仍然是“不够，不够！”他最喜欢背诵毛主席的两句话：“关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。”经常用这两句话来鞭策自己，检查自己。用完全彻底为人民服务的精神，严格要求自己。
    毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大号召以后，麦贤得同志最积极地响应，最坚决地执行。他说：“对思想上的敌人，要象对美国鬼子一样，哒哒哒，枪毙它！”他决心遵循毛主席的最新指示，更加自觉，更加严格地要求自己，彻底斗私，一心为公，沿着思想革命化的道路阔步前进。
    林彪副主席号召我们：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。”
    麦贤得同志以自己的斗争实践，最坚决、最忠实地执行了林副主席的这一指示。在他身上，闪耀着毛泽东思想的灿烂光辉，显示了共产主义的一代新人的崭新的精神面貌。
