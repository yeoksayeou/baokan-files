The sky is not as high as Chairman Mao's prestige, the sea is not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will not let you down, and we will definitely follow your latest instructions to fiercely combat selfishness and thoroughly criticize revisionism, tempering ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the midst of great storms and waves.

We, active learners of Chairman Mao's works from the Beijing Military Region, Guo Fenglian, Rong Gaigai, and Zhang Yucheng, declare:

The most resounding song is "The East is Red," the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. The happiest people in the world are those who have seen our red sun, Chairman Mao. We have been thinking of you day and night, and on the 13th, we finally saw you. When we saw Chairman Mao, with his face radiant and steps vigorous, smiling and walking towards us, our hearts were so moved that they seemed to jump out of our chests!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! The sky is not as high as your prestige, the sea is not as deep as your kindness. The earth is not as vast as your ideological influence, and parents are not as dear as you. Looking at your kind face, we were so moved that tears of happiness flowed. We have a thousand words to say, but they all boil down to one sentence: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! It is you, the great teacher, who have led the Chinese people to overcome countless difficulties, break through stormy waves, and march from victory to victory! It is you, the great leader, who have shown such meticulous care for the younger generation, pointing out the direction for our progress and nurturing our healthy growth! It is you, the great commander, who have ignited the flames of the Cultural Revolution, leading the revolutionary masses nationwide to destroy the old and establish the new, smashing the headquarters of the bourgeoisie, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and promoting the revolutionary transformation of people's thinking, making our motherland's face completely new. It is you, the great helmsman, who have opened up the revolutionary path for the people of the world, providing a powerful ideological weapon for the world's people to fight against imperialism and revisionism, guiding the people of the world to revolution to the end.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your health is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Today, you have received us, which is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest motivation for us. We will not let you down, and we will definitely follow your latest instructions to fiercely combat selfishness and thoroughly criticize revisionism, igniting a revolution in our hearts.

We will closely follow your great strategic deployment, deeply carry out the great criticism, thoroughly criticize the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, led by China's Khrushchev, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, so that they can never rise again!

We pledge to forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the fierce and complex class struggle, we dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! We are determined to temper ourselves into successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause in the midst of great storms and waves!

    最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东，世界上最最幸福的人是见到了我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的人。我们日日夜夜想念的毛主席，十三日终于见到了。当我们看到毛主席他老人家红光满面，神采奕奕，迈着健壮的步伐，微笑着向我们走来的时候，我们的心呀，真是激动得要跳出来！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！天高没有您老人家的威望高，海深没有您老人家的恩情深，天大地大没有您老人家的思想威力大，爹亲娘亲没有您老人家亲。我们望着您慈祥的面孔，感动得流出幸福的眼泪。我们有千言万语要说，汇成一句话，祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您，伟大的导师，领导着中国人民克服重重困难，冲破惊涛骇浪，从胜利走向胜利！是您，伟大的领袖，对青年一代关怀得无微不至，为我们指出了前进的方向，哺育着我们健康地成长！是您，伟大的统帅，点燃了无产阶级文化大革命的烈火，领导全国革命群众破旧立新，摧毁了资产阶级司令部，巩固了无产阶级专政，同时促进了人的思想革命化，使祖国面貌焕然一新。是您，伟大的舵手，为全世界人民开辟了革命的航道，给了世界人民反帝反修的强大思想武器，引导全世界人民革命到底。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您老人家身体那样健康，这是全中国和全世界人民最大最大的幸福。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您今天接见了我们，这对我们是最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。我们决不辜负您老人家的教导和希望，一定按照您的最新指示，狠斗私，猛批修，在灵魂深处爆发革命。
    我们要紧跟您的伟大战略部署，深入开展革命的大批判，把以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深批透，批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！
    我们保证永远永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们在激烈复杂的阶级斗争中，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！我们决心在大风大浪里把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的接班人！
