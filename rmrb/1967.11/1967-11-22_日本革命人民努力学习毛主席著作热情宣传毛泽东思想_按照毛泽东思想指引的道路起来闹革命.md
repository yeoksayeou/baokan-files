Japanese revolutionary people have an infinite love and faith in the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and Mao Zedong Thought. In their struggle against imperialism and revisionism, they have launched a wave of actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They resolutely follow the brilliant path indicated by Mao Zedong Thought to make revolution.

In places like Yamaguchi, Fukuoka, Kyoto, and Osaka, the leftist factions of the Japanese Communist Party have promoted the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. The Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox), the Japan Committee for Afro-Asian Solidarity, and other progressive organizations that advocate for Japan-China friendship have actively participated in this study movement. Currently, the primary organizational form for Japanese revolutionary people to study Chairman Mao's works is through study groups set up at workplaces, labor sites, dormitories, and homes. Their study materials include reading or deeply studying the four volumes of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," and according to the needs of different periods of struggle, studying important documents such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "On New Democracy," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "Talk on Supporting the Just Struggle of the Japanese People Against U.S. Imperialism and for National Independence," the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and "Opposing Liberalism." "Quotations from Chairman Mao" is the guide to action for the Japanese revolutionary people.

Studying Chairman Mao's works has made the Japanese revolutionary people clear-sighted, clarified their revolutionary goals, strengthened their revolutionary faith, and greatly promoted their struggles. They say: "As long as we persist in actively studying and applying Mao Zedong's works, we will definitely achieve victory in the revolutionary struggle"; "The Japanese people want liberation and can only rely on Mao Zedong Thought; Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path of the Japanese revolution"; "Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon to defeat the oppression and suppression of the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. The Japanese people have grasped Mao Zedong Thought, and the Japanese revolution has a reliable guarantee."

In Tokyo, there is a slum area called Yamagaya, where unemployed and semi-unemployed workers live. After studying Chairman Mao's works, the workers there understood the truth of violent revolution. They say: "The enemy uses violence, attacking us with clubs, so we must use the same methods to deal with them." Their heightened class consciousness has enabled them to achieve victory after victory in their struggles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. Summarizing their learning and struggle experiences, they say: "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the residents of Yamagaya have united closely and fought against the enemy head-on, which is victory." Farmers in Tokyo's Sunagawa District, influenced by this study movement, have also organized to persistently study Chairman Mao's works. When the U.S. military attempted to seize their land to expand the Sunagawa military airbase, the united farmers raised the slogan "Not an inch of Japanese land to the U.S. military" and fought resolutely, effectively thwarting the U.S. imperialists' evil intentions.

Residents of Gyobashi City in Fukuoka Prefecture, after studying Chairman Mao's works, often use class analysis to observe developments in Japan's politics, economy, culture, and society. In their struggles against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries, they have formulated correct strategies and tactics and achieved continuous victories. The Gyobashi City branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) has also organized children, adapting to their characteristics, to receive Mao Zedong Thought education, so as to pass on Mao Zedong Thought to the next generation.

While using Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggles, Japanese revolutionary people also use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective world and actively promote Mao Zedong Thought. Progressive publications such as "Revolutionary Warrior," "Long Weekly News," and "Mao Zedong Thought Studies" have, at the request of the masses, repeatedly published and printed outlines and summaries of studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," etc.

The Yamaguchi Prefectural Committee (leftist faction) of the Japanese Communist Party has designated "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and "Opposing Liberalism" as the basic textbooks that all party members must read. Famous Japanese artist Otani Takeyama, who insists on actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, recently broke with the Miyamoto group and expressed his determination to "continue to actively study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, go deep into the masses of workers and peasants, serve the people, and strive for the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan." Japanese youth Hasegawa Tetsu, who enthusiastically studies the "Three Constantly Read Articles," participated in the struggle against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and Japanese Communist Party revisionists who disrupted the Great Friendship Festival between Japanese and Chinese youth. He rode a bicycle from Tokyo to Shimonoseki, a distance of over a thousand kilometers, on a "Long March." He hung a portrait of Chairman Mao on his bicycle, went deep into the masses of workers and peasants along the way, studied and promoted Mao Zedong Thought, and exposed the conspiracies of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

Currently, the broad revolutionary people of Japan are enthusiastically studying Chairman Mao's works and promoting Mao Zedong Thought. A broad mass movement to use Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective world and promote the development of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles is flourishing.

    日本革命人民努力学习毛主席著作热情宣传毛泽东思想
    按照毛泽东思想指引的道路起来闹革命
    日本革命人民，无限热爱、无限信仰世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想。他们在反帝、反修斗争中，掀起了一个活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，他们坚决按照毛泽东思想所指引的光辉道路闹革命。
    日本山口、福冈、京都、大阪等地的日共（左派）组织推动了学习毛主席著作的运动。日中友好协会（正统）、亚非团结日本委员会和其他坚持日中友好的文化、贸易团体等进步组织，积极地投入了这项学习活动。目前日本革命人民学习毛主席著作的主要组织形式是设在工作岗位、劳动场所、宿舍和家庭里的毛泽东著作学习小组。他们学习的内容是通读或精读《毛泽东选集》四卷，并按照不同时期的斗争需要，学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《新民主主义论》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《支持日本人民反美爱国正义斗争的谈话》、“老三篇”以及《反对自由主义》等重要文献。《毛主席语录》是日本革命人民的行动指南。
    学习毛主席著作，使日本革命人民心明眼亮，明确了革命目标，坚定了革命的信心，大大推动了他们的斗争。他们说：“能够长期坚持活学活用毛泽东著作，就一定会取得革命斗争的胜利”；“日本人民要想求得解放，只有依靠毛泽东思想；毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了日本革命的道路”；“毛泽东思想是战胜美日反动派奴役和压迫的强大武器，日本人民掌握了毛泽东思想，日本的革命就有了可靠的保证。”
    东京有个住着失业和半失业工人的贫民区——山谷。这里的工人在学习毛主席著作后懂得了暴力革命的真理。他们说：“敌人使用暴力，用棍棒袭击我们，我们就必须以同样的办法去对付他们”。不断提高的阶级觉悟，使他们在同美日反动派的斗争中，取得了一次又一次的胜利。他们在总结学习和斗争经验时说：“在毛泽东思想的指引下，使山谷的居民紧密地团结起来，针锋相对地同敌人进行斗争，就是胜利”。东京砂川区的一些农民，在这一学习运动的影响下，也组织起来坚持学习毛主席著作。当美军为扩大砂川区军用机场而强占他们的土地时，团结起来的农民提出了“不把日本的一寸土地交给美军”的口号，进行了坚决的斗争，有效地阻止了美国鬼子的罪恶企图。
    福冈县行桥市居民在学习毛主席著作后，经常用阶级分析的方法，观察日本政治、经济、文化、社会等方面的动向，在反抗美日反动派斗争中制订了正确的战略和策略，不断取得胜利。这个小市镇的日中友好协会（正统）支部，把孩子们也组织起来，适应他们的特点，进行毛泽东思想教育，以便把毛泽东思想传给下一代。
    日本革命人民在用毛泽东思想指导斗争的同时，也用毛泽东思想改造自己的主观世界，并积极地宣传毛泽东思想。《革命战士》《长周新闻》《毛泽东思想研究》和其他进步报刊应广大群众的要求，一再刊登和出版学习“老三篇”的要点和提纲等等。
    日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）把《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》和《反对自由主义》这几篇光辉著作定为全体党员必读的基本教材。日本著名艺人大谷竹山，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，不久前和宫本集团决裂，他表示要“继续活学活用毛泽东思想，深入工农群众，为人民服务，为增强日中两国人民的友好而奋斗”。热情学习“老三篇”的日本青年长谷川彻在反对美日反动派和日共修正主义分子破坏日中青年友好大联欢时，乘自行车进行了从东京到下关长达一千多公里的“长征”。他在自行车上挂着毛主席像，沿途深入工农群众，一边学习，一边宣传毛泽东思想，并且揭露帝、修、反的阴谋。
    目前日本的广大革命人民正在热情洋溢地学习毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想。一个广泛的用毛泽东思想来改造自己的主观世界，用毛泽东思想来推动反帝、反修斗争的发展的群众性热潮，正在蓬勃发展。
