The fascist military regime led by Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia recently brazenly severed diplomatic relations with China, which was enthusiastically applauded by the chief henchman of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist clique.

According to reports from the mouthpiece of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Radio Jakarta, and the Antara News Agency, one of the leaders of the "Cooperative Parliament," a tool of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Hussein Katasasmita, returned to Jakarta after a half-month of activities in the Soviet Union. On the 4th, he told reporters that the Indonesian fascist military regime, in order to adapt to the anti-China needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, publicly took the serious anti-China step of severing diplomatic relations with China, which was met with "very pleasant" welcome from the Soviet revisionist clique.

Hussein revealed that the Soviet revisionist clique also lavishly praised the fascist military clique leaders who had been madly engaging in anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people crimes in the Thousand Island Country over the past two years, and expressed trust in "General Suharto's leadership."

Hussein also revealed that the Soviet revisionist clique openly expressed its desire to strengthen its counter-revolutionary collusion with the Indonesian fascist military regime. Hussein said that during his talks with the Soviet revisionist clique, he found that "the Soviet government... is very eager to continue maintaining the friendly relations that have been established between Indonesia and the Soviet Union in this period."

The Soviet revisionist clique's fawning praise of its anti-China allies once again proves that it is in cahoots with the Indonesian fascist military regime.

    美帝走狗反华  美帝帮凶喝采
    苏修集团公然“欢迎”印尼反动政权中断同中国外交关系的反华步骤
    据新华社十六日讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权最近悍然中断同中国的外交关系，得到了美帝国主义的头号帮凶苏修统治集团的热烈喝采。
    据印尼法西斯军人政权的喉舌雅加达电台和安塔拉通讯社报道，印尼法西斯军人政权的御用工具“合作国会”头目之一侯赛因·卡塔萨斯米塔在苏联进行了半个月的活动后，最近返回雅加达。四日，他对记者发表谈话说，印尼法西斯军人政权为了适应美帝苏修的反华需要公然采取中断同中国的外交关系这一严重反华步骤，受到了苏修统治集团“十分令人好感的欢迎”。
    侯赛因透露，苏修统治集团还大肆吹捧两年来在千岛之国疯狂进行反共、反华、反人民罪恶勾当的法西斯军人集团头目苏哈托，并对“苏哈托上将的领导表示信任”。
    侯赛因还透露，苏修统治集团公开表示，渴望加紧同印尼法西斯军人政权的反革命勾结。侯赛因说，他同苏修统治集团举行会谈时发现，“苏联政府……非常渴望继续保持印尼和苏联之间这个时期以来所建立的友好关系”。
    苏修统治集团如此肉麻地吹捧它的反华同盟军，再一次证明它同印尼法西斯军人政权是一丘之貉。
