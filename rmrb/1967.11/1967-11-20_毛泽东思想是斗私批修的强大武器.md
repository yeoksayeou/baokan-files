The Mao Zedong Thought study class in the Beijing Hotel System is well-organized. The most fundamental experience they have is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought among the broad revolutionary cadres and workers.

Our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, enjoys great prestige among the people. The broad masses of the people have the deepest class feelings for our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao. The revolutionary masses listen most to Chairman Mao's words and most resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. As long as we resolutely spread Mao Zedong Thought among the broad revolutionary masses, let Chairman Mao's latest instructions meet the broad revolutionary masses as quickly and widely as possible, the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought will surely become a great material force. Difficulties will turn into smooth sailing, setbacks will turn into successes, and any complex and difficult problems will be solved.

The Beijing Hotel System, precisely because it has firmly grasped the propaganda and study of Mao Zedong Thought and held extensive Mao Zedong Thought study classes, has quickly united the two major revolutionary mass organizations that were once "irreconcilable" under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. People's ideological appearance has also undergone great changes. The facts irrefutably prove that in the minds of the broad revolutionary cadres, the position of Mao Zedong Thought has been expanded, proletarian party spirit has been strengthened, petty-bourgeois factionalism has been reduced, selfishness has been eliminated, the atmosphere of great unity and solidarity has become thicker, and the momentum of seizing the revolution and promoting production has become even greater.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said in his speech on National Day: "Chairman Mao recently instructed us to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Struggling against selfishness is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to struggle against the 'self' in one's own mind. Criticizing revisionism is to use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to oppose revisionism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road." We must follow Vice Chairman Lin Biao's instructions and, in any place and under any circumstances, firmly grasp the propaganda and study of Mao Zedong Thought and firmly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our powerful ideological weapon to struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism. Use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to advance the great alliance of the revolution, the three-in-one combination of the revolution, the great criticism of the revolution, and the surging tide of struggle-criticism-transformation in various units.

    毛泽东思想是斗私批修的强大武器
    本报评论员
    北京市饭店系统毛泽东思想学习班办得好。
    他们的经验，最根本的一条，就是高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在广大革命职工和革命干部中大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，在人民群众中享有崇高的威望；广大人民群众对我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，怀着最深厚的阶级感情。广大革命人民最听毛主席的话，最坚决地照毛主席的指示办事。只要我们坚决地把毛泽东思想灌输到广大革命群众中去，让毛主席的最新指示，最迅速、最广泛地和广大革命群众见面，光焰无际的毛泽东思想就必定会变成巨大的物质力量。困难就会转化为顺利，挫折就会转化为成功，任何复杂繁难的问题就会迎刃而解。
    北京市饭店系统，正因为狠抓了毛泽东思想的宣传和学习，大办毛泽东思想学习班，原来“势不两立”的两大派革命群众组织，很快就在毛泽东思想的旗帜下联合起来了，人们的思想面貌也发生了很大的变化。事实无可辩驳地证明：在广大革命职工的头脑里，毛泽东思想阵地扩大了，无产阶级党性就增强了，小资产阶级派性就减少了，私字就退位了，大联合的气氛、团结的气氛就浓厚了，抓革命、促生产的劲头也就更大了。
    林彪副主席在国庆节的讲话中说：“毛主席最近指示我们，要斗私，批修。斗私，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同自己头脑里的‘私’字作斗争。批修，就是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想去反对修正主义，去同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。”我们一定要遵照林彪副主席的指示，在任何地方和任何情况下，都要狠抓毛泽东思想的宣传和学习，狠抓毛主席最新指示的落实。用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为我们斗私批修的强大思想武器，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想推进革命的大联合、革命的三结合、革命的大批判和各单位斗批改的洪流滚滚向前。
