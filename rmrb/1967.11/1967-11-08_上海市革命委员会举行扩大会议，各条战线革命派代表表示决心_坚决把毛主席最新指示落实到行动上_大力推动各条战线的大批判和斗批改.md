Editor's Note: Today's issue of this newspaper publishes the news that the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held an enlarged meeting, deciding to promptly implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions on all fronts. This is hoped to attract the attention of revolutionary committees and proletarian revolutionary factions in various places.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the highest guidelines for us to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must place them in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything. For every item and every point in Chairman Mao's instructions, we must resolutely, promptly, and without any deviation, implement them in our thoughts and practices. This is the most fundamental and important criterion to measure whether we are following Chairman Mao, following Mao Zedong Thought, and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments.

Recently, Chairman Mao's important instructions on the proletarian education revolution are not only a general mobilization order to thoroughly smash the bourgeois education system and mobilize the masses to carry out the proletarian education revolution, but also a powerful ideological weapon for deepening the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on other fronts and doing a good job of struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit. For Chairman Mao's latest instructions, proletarian revolutionary fighters on all fronts must resolutely carry them out, immediately carry them out, carry them out word for word, and character for character.

As proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, we must follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. We must implement Chairman Mao's every instruction in our actions.

	New China News Agency, Shanghai, November 7th: Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian education revolution have become a powerful ideological weapon for Shanghai to further advance the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and deepen the struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit. On the evening of the 4th, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee held an enlarged meeting, seriously studied the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and based on Chairman Mao's latest instructions, discussed issues related to struggle-criticism-transformation in the city's primary, secondary, and tertiary schools and various fronts. They decided to promptly and without any deviation implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions in the actual work of all fronts, taking "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, to promote revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit, and to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	At the meeting, representatives from the "May 7th" Commune of Tongji University introduced their experiences in carrying out the education revolution, representatives from the Shanghai Commercial Bureau No. 2 introduced their experiences in cadres going to the grassroots to carry out struggle-criticism-transformation, and representatives from the China Clock Factory introduced their experiences in streamlining administration and personnel. They excitedly expressed that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have once again pointed out the direction for us and given us a powerful impetus.

	Representatives from various fronts who participated in the enlarged meeting enthusiastically discussed the great significance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Everyone agreed that the proletarian education revolution is a very important aspect of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To carry out the proletarian education revolution, we must fully mobilize the masses and firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. Deepening the education revolution not only requires reforming the old education system but, more importantly, eliminating the bourgeois ideology from people's minds. We must take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, thoroughly smash the old culture, old thoughts, old customs, and old institutions of capitalism, revisionism, and feudalism, and completely shatter the spiritual shackles that have been imposed on people's minds for a long time. To dare to do this, we must first eliminate the "self" from our own minds, with unyielding revolutionary spirit, be thorough revolutionaries, and display the great revolutionary spirit of daring to sacrifice personal interests for this great proletarian education revolution of historic significance. Proletarian revolutionaries must be revolutionaries and vanguards, displaying the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, and dare to innovate; at the same time, we must combine the proletarian revolutionary spirit with a strict scientific attitude, and in an organized, planned, and step-by-step manner, deepen the movement.

	The comrades who participated in the enlarged meeting also unanimously agreed that at this crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, Chairman Mao's extremely important latest instructions on carrying out the proletarian education revolution have immeasurable and far-reaching significance. Chairman Mao's latest instructions are not only a general mobilization order to thoroughly smash the bourgeois education system and mobilize the masses to carry out the proletarian education revolution, but also have universal guiding significance and a great promoting role for deepening the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on other fronts. The proletarian revolutionaries on all fronts in the city must seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, study the thorough revolutionary spirit of the Red Guards and revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of several schools such as Tongji University, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, fully mobilize the masses, firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionaries determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, take "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, and do a good job of revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit.

	The meeting unanimously expressed that in the current situation of a great revolutionary upsurge throughout the country, we must further strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, carry out the revolutionization of thought, set up a number of advanced models, and make new contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    编者按：今天本报发表的上海市革命委员会举行扩大会议，决心雷厉风行地把毛主席的最新指示落实到各条战线上去的消息，希望引起各地革命委员会和无产阶级革命派重视。
    毛主席的最新指示，是我们进行无产阶级文化大革命的最高纲领。我们一定要把它放在高于一切，大于一切，重于一切，先于一切的地位。对毛主席的指示，每一项，每一条，都要坚决地、雷厉风行地、不折不扣地落实到我们的思想和实践中去。这是衡量我们是不是紧跟毛主席、紧跟毛泽东思想、紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署的最根本最重要的标志。
    最近，毛主席对无产阶级教育革命所作的重要指示，不仅是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度，发动群众进行无产阶级教育革命的总动员令，而且是其它各条战线上深入开展无产阶级文化大革命，搞好本单位斗批改的强大思想武器。对毛主席的这个最新指示，各条战线上的无产阶级革命战士，都要坚决照办，立即照办，句句照办，字字照办。
    我们当一个决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，就要紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，就要把毛主席的每个指示落实到行动中去。
    新华社上海七日电　我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，已成为上海当前进一步开展无产阶级文化大革命、深入开展各单位斗批改的强大思想武器。四日晚，上海市革命委员会举行扩大会议，认真学习了伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，同时根据毛主席的最新指示，讨论了本市大、中、小学和各条战线斗批改的有关问题，决心雷厉风行、不折不扣地把毛主席的最新指示落实到各条战线的实际工作中去，以“斗私，批修”为纲，推动革命大批判和各单位斗批改，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    会上，同济大学“五·七”公社代表介绍了他们进行教育革命的经验，上海市商业二局代表介绍了干部下基层搞斗批改的经验，中国钟厂代表介绍了精兵简政的经验。他们激动地表示：毛主席的最新指示又一次为我们指明了方向，给了我们强大的推动力。
    参加扩大会议的各条战线的无产阶级革命派代表，热烈讨论了毛主席最新指示的伟大意义。大家认为，无产阶级教育革命是无产阶级文化大革命极其重要的一个方面。进行无产阶级教育革命，必须充分发动群众，坚决依靠决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。深入开展教育革命，不仅要改革旧的教育制度，尤其重要的是清除人们头脑里的剥削阶级思想。必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，大破资本主义、修正主义、封建主义的旧文化、旧思想、旧风俗和旧制度，彻底砸烂长期加在人们头脑中的精神枷锁。要敢于这样做，必须首先破除自己头脑里的“私”字，以坚韧不拔的革命精神，做彻底革命的闯将，发扬为这场具有伟大历史意义的无产阶级教育革命赴汤蹈火、不惜牺牲个人利益的大无畏的革命精神。无产阶级革命派要做革命的闯将、先锋，要发扬敢想、敢干、敢于创造的革命精神；同时，要把无产阶级革命精神同严格的科学态度结合起来，有领导、有计划、有步骤地把运动深入开展下去。
    参加扩大会议的同志还一致认为：在当前无产阶级文化大革命已经取得决定性胜利的关键时刻，毛主席发出关于进行无产阶级教育革命的极其重要的最新指示，有着不可估量的深远意义。毛主席的最新指示，不仅是彻底摧毁资产阶级教育制度，发动群众进行无产阶级教育革命的总动员令，而且对其他各条战线深入开展无产阶级文化大革命，具有普遍的指导意义，起着巨大的推动作用。全市各条战线的无产阶级革命派，必须认真学习毛主席这一最新指示，学习同济大学等几所学校的红卫兵小将、革命师生员工的彻底革命精神，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，充分发动群众，坚决依靠决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
    会议一致表示，在当前全国一片大好革命形势下，一定要进一步努力活学活用毛主席著作，搞好思想革命化，树立一批先进的典型，为无产阶级文化大革命立新功。
