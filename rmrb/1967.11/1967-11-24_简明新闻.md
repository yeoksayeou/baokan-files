On the evening of November 20, when the reactionary and traitorous Japanese Prime Minister Sato returned from the United States, 110,000 people from various sectors in Okinawa held a large-scale protest meeting and demonstration in Naha City. They angrily condemned the Sato-Johnson joint communiqué, which trampled on the will of the Okinawan people, and demanded the immediate resignation of the reactionary and traitorous Sato government.

The meeting and demonstration were organized by the "Okinawa Reversion to the Motherland Council," which consists of 50 organizations. According to reports, the meeting was filled with a strong anti-American and anti-Sato government atmosphere, showing the unprecedented fighting spirit of the Okinawan people.

After the meeting, the participants, shouting slogans such as "Get out of Okinawa, American imperialists!" and "Down with the traitorous Sato government!", marched through the streets of Naha City in the rain.
