	Let Mao Zedong Thought guide every second of my life.
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I will study your works and commit every word to heart; I will carry out your instructions without the slightest deviation; I will propagate your brilliant thoughts without a moment's pause; I will defend your revolutionary line with unwavering resolve. Beijing Military Region Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, He Xiangkui

	Thousands of words surge in my heart, waves of emotion and tears of joy!

	At six o'clock in the afternoon on November 13, the most blessed moment I had longed for day and night finally arrived. I was honored to see our greatest leader, the revolutionary guide of the world's people, the reddest sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is in such good health, with boundless energy! This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China and the world! My excitement was uncontrollable, and my tears of joy were unstoppable. As Chairman Mao walked towards us with vigorous steps, I could not express my boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty to him with a thousand words. I shouted "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" a thousand times.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! It is your boundless great thought that illuminates the world and lights up my life's battle path. I deeply feel that being a revolutionary soldier of the proletariat is to be infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and to fight for the absolute authority of you and your brilliant thoughts for life. With you and your brilliant thoughts, I have everything, the greatest courage, and the strongest willpower. Thinking of your brilliant image, we see clearly and have boundless strength; remembering your great teachings, we dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire!

	Last spring, in the critical moment when raging fires seriously threatened the lives and property of the people, I saw your kind and benevolent face and heard your voice: "To die for the people's interests is heavier than Mount Tai!" I forgot everything, and only your brilliant thoughts guided my battle! I rushed through the smoke, climbed the hill, and charged into the fire. My fire-fighting tools were burned to ashes, and even I was burned into a "fire man." Without fire-fighting tools, I used my hands to beat and my feet to stomp. When my hands and feet were burned, I quickly used my body to press down on the fiercest part of the fire, piece by piece, and rolled over it, until I fainted. What power inspired me to fight against the fire? It was the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	In the hospital, treating my wounds was the same. It was the great image and kind face of Chairman Mao that inspired me to overcome the unbearable pain of ninety percent burns on my body; it was Chairman Mao's great teaching of "making up your mind, not fearing sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory" that made me, after a year and seven months of treatment, overcome my injuries and gain a second life.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In our struggles, we see your image every day and are inspired. Today, you personally received us, which is the greatest care and inspiration for us. Dear Chairman Mao, with tears of joy, I declare before you: I will study your works and commit every word to heart; I will carry out your instructions without the slightest deviation; I will propagate your brilliant thoughts without a moment's pause; I will defend your revolutionary line with unwavering resolve. I will defend your supreme leadership position with my life, defend your brilliant thoughts with my life, and forever let your brilliant thoughts guide every second of my life, letting your brilliant thoughts command every nerve of mine, to fully engage in the battle to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    用毛泽东思想统帅我生命的每一秒钟
    毛主席啊，毛主席！学习您的著作，我一定一字一句刻心头；执行您的指示，我一定一丝一毫不走样；宣传您的光辉思想，我一定一分一秒不停息；捍卫您的革命路线，我一定一心一意不动摇。北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　贺相魁
    千言万语涌心头，心潮逐浪喜泪流！
    十一月十三日下午六点钟，我日日想，夜夜盼的最最幸福的时刻来到了，我光荣地见到了我们最伟大的领袖、世界人民的革命导师、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。毛主席他老人家身体是那样健康，精力是那样充沛，这是全中国和全世界人民的最大幸福！我激动的心情无法抑制，幸福的热泪无法控制。当毛主席迈着矫健的步伐走向我们的时候，我千言万语也表达不完对他老人家的无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。我千遍万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万万岁！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！是您光焰无际的伟大思想普照全球，也照亮了我一生的战斗道路。我深深感到，做一个无产阶级革命战士，就是要无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，就是要为捍卫您和您的光辉思想的绝对权威而终生战斗。有了您和您的光辉思想，才有我的一切，才能有最大的勇敢，最坚强的毅力。想起您的光辉形象，我们就心明眼亮，力量无穷；记住您的伟大教导，我们就刀山敢上，火海敢闯！
    前年春天，在熊熊烈火严重威胁人民生命财产的紧急时刻，我眼前出现了您的亲切慈祥的面孔，耳边响起了您的声音：“为人民利益而死，就比泰山还重”！我忘记了一切，只有您的光辉思想指挥着我战斗！我穿过浓烟，爬上高坡，冲进烈火，手中的灭火工具被烧成灰了，连我自己也被大火烧成了“火”人。没有灭火工具，我就用手打，用脚踩。手脚烧坏了，我就迅速地以身体扑倒在火势最旺的地方，一块一块地压，一片一片地滚，直到昏迷过去。是什么力量鼓舞我与烈火搏斗？是战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    在医院里治病也是这样。是毛主席您老人家的伟大形象和慈祥面孔，鼓舞着我战胜全身百分之九十的烧伤而带来的难忍疼痛；是毛主席您老人家“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的伟大教导，使我经过一年又七个月的治疗，战胜了伤残，获得了第二次生命。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们在斗争中天天看到您老人家的像，天天受到鼓舞。今天，您老人家亲自接见我们，这是对我们的最大关怀、最大鼓舞。敬爱的毛主席，我含着幸福的泪花，在您老人家面前表示决心：学习您的著作，我一定一字一句刻心头；执行您的指示，我一定一丝一毫不走样；宣传您的光辉思想，我一定一分一秒不停息；捍卫您的革命路线，我一定一心一意不动摇。我要誓死捍卫您的最高领袖地位，誓死捍卫您的光辉思想，永远用您的光辉思想统帅我生命的每一秒钟，让您的光辉思想指挥我的每一根神经，去全力投入把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的战斗！
