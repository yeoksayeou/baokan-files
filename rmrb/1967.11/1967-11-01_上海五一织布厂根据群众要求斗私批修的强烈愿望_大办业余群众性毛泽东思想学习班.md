The proletarian revolutionary cadres of Shanghai May 1st Textile Mill, in response to the revolutionary masses' enthusiastic demand to implement the great leader Chairman Mao's latest instructions and their strong desire to fight self and criticize revisionism, rely on the masses, strengthen leadership, and primarily conduct part-time mass Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Now, over 300 workers in this mill have undergone a round of training in a short period, achieving remarkable results.

The Shanghai *Wen Hui Bao* published an editorial note on this news, pointing out that it is better for grassroots units to conduct mass Mao Zedong Thought study classes primarily in their spare time.

After studying Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central China, and East China, the revolutionary workers of Shanghai May 1st Textile Mill immediately started Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to the principle of making revolution in spare time. Since October 8, they have conducted three sessions. Each session lasts one week, with two hours of study per day. The classes are divided according to production shifts. They use the "Three Articles" as the basic textbook, focusing on self-criticism, and let the masses educate themselves. The classes are guided by the principle of "fighting self and criticizing revisionism," addressing specific issues in each class based on the conditions of each production team. Many veteran workers recall past hardships and bitter experiences during the study, denouncing the "exploitation is meritorious" fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev, directing their criticism at the Chinese Khrushchev. This has given the broad masses a vivid class education, raised their class consciousness, strengthened the unity between the masses and the revolutionary cadres, and enhanced the unity between old and new cadres.

The study classes have improved with each session, creating a heated atmosphere of mutual pursuit in the struggle to fight self and criticize revisionism. After the first session of study classes began, those preparing for the second session did not want to fall behind, and after thorough preparation, they immediately posted a resolution to fight self with "hand-to-hand combat." Those preparing for the third session also expressed their determination to be the vanguard of fighting self and criticizing revisionism and to be pioneers in "seizing the revolution and promoting production." In six night shifts, their attendance rate reached 100%, the output exceeded the plan, the quality significantly improved, and both output and quality reached new historical highs.

The main reasons why the Mao Zedong Thought part-time study classes in May 1st Textile Mill are successful are as follows:

First, relying on the masses and respecting their pioneering spirit. The revolutionary cadres of this mill realized that Chairman Mao's latest instructions have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people, and fighting self and criticizing revisionism have become the conscious demand of the broad revolutionary workers. They fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. The plans and methods for conducting study classes are all discussed with the masses. The small group meetings and large group meetings of the study classes are all managed by the masses themselves, with cadres not taking over. Therefore, the masses' enthusiasm for study is very high.

Second, strengthening leadership and continuous improvement. The revolutionary cadres of this mill are good at listening to the masses' opinions and improving their work. When the first session of study classes began, some cadres did not put themselves in the study process and did not truly put down their airs. The workers discovered this situation and seriously criticized it. The revolutionary committee of the rebel faction seriously listened to the masses' opinions and, while conducting the third session of study classes, also conducted study classes for old and new cadres to help cadres better fight self and criticize revisionism. On the other hand, the committee seriously conducted self-criticism and took the lead in exposing their thoughts in the study classes, which was welcomed by the masses. The revolutionary cadres of this mill also used blackboards and mimeographed bulletins to quickly publicize the advanced examples of the study classes, promote the advanced, create a strong atmosphere, exchange experiences, and promote each other. In this way, the entire mill is in a heated atmosphere of mutual pursuit, and the study classes are becoming more and more vigorous.

Third, timely summarization and consolidation of achievements. After each session of study classes, a simple summary is made to promote the advantages and learn from the lessons. During the summarization, the principle of "from the masses to the masses" is also implemented, fully mobilizing the masses to make summaries themselves and then promoting them. After the study classes end, they do not just disperse; instead, they continue the mass practice of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and fighting self and criticizing revisionism. Now, workers who have participated in the study classes generally continue to study consciously.

The editorial note published in the Shanghai *Wen Hui Bao* points out that conducting mass Mao Zedong Thought study classes primarily in spare time in grassroots units is in line with the broad revolutionary masses' strong desire to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and carry out the struggle to fight self and criticize revisionism. Now, the broad revolutionary masses are eager to participate in Mao Zedong Thought study classes. However, conducting large-scale off-duty study is inevitably restricted by various conditions. Conducting Mao Zedong Thought study classes primarily in spare time can be widely and extensively conducted, meeting the demands of the broad masses to the greatest extent. Conducting study classes primarily in spare time is also in line with the spirit of making revolution in spare time. We should conduct good off-duty study classes. However, if a large number of people conduct off-duty study, it will inevitably affect production and work. Conducting extensive part-time study classes is beneficial for popularization and is also beneficial for seizing the revolution, promoting production, and promoting work.

    上海五一织布厂根据群众要求斗私批修的强烈愿望
    大办业余群众性毛泽东思想学习班
    学习班按生产班次划分，根据各班组的具体情况，突出重点，一期解决一个问题
    全厂三百多名职工已普遍轮训一次，阶级觉悟大大提高，革命和生产出现新面貌
    新华社上海三十日电  上海五一织布厂无产阶级革命派，根据革命群众积极要求贯彻执行伟大领袖毛主席最新指示和自觉要求斗私批修的强烈愿望，依靠群众，加强领导，以业余为主大办群众性的毛泽东思想学习班。现在，这个厂三百多名职工已在短期内普遍轮训一次，收到了显著效果。
    上海《文汇报》在报道这一消息时，发表了编者按。编者按指出，基层单位办群众性的毛泽东思想学习班，还是以业余为主好。
    上海五一织布厂的革命职工学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东等地区所作的一系列重要指示以后，立刻按照业余闹革命的原则，办起了毛泽东思想学习班。从十月八日到现在，已经办了三期。每期学习班为一星期，每天业余学习两小时。学习班按生产班次分班。他们以
  “老三篇”为基本教材，以自我批评为主，让群众自己教育自己。学习班以“斗私，批修”为纲，根据各班组的具体情况，突出重点，一期解决一个问题。很多老工人在学习中忆苦思甜，痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的谬论，把矛头集中指向中国赫鲁晓夫，使广大群众受到一次生动的阶级教育，提高了阶级觉悟，加强了群众和革命派之间的团结，加强了新老干部的团结。
    学习班一期比一期办得好，全厂出现了在斗私批修斗争中你追我赶的热烈气氛。当第一期学习班开办后，准备参加第二期学习班的同志不甘落后，经过充分酝酿，立即贴出斗私要打“肉搏战”的决心书。准备参加第三期学习班的同志，也表示要以实际行动争当斗私批修的尖兵，做“抓革命，促生产”的闯将。他们在六天夜班中，出勤率达到百分之百，产品的产量超过计划，质量显著提高，产量和质量都突破了历史上的最高水平。
    五一织布厂毛泽东思想业余学习班办得好，主要的原因有三条：
    一，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。这个厂的革命派负责人认识到，毛主席的最新指示已经深入人心，斗私批修已成为广大革命职工的自觉要求。他们充分地相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。举办学习班的方案、办法，都同群众商量。学习班的小组会、大组会，都由群众自己掌握，干部不包办代替。因此，群众的学习积极性很高。
    二，加强领导，不断提高。这个厂的革命派，很善于听取群众的意见，改进工作。第一期学习班刚开办，革命派负责人和革命干部同群众一起参加学习，有的同志在学习过程中没有把自己摆进去，架子没有真正放下来，工人们发现了这种情况，严肃地提出了批评。造反队队委认真地听取了群众的意见，在开办第三期学习班的同时，加办了新老干部的学习班，促使干部更好地斗私批修。另一方面，队委认真作了自我批评，在学习班中带头亮思想，受到了群众的欢迎。这个厂的革命派还利用黑板报、油印快报，迅速宣传学习班的先进事例，发扬先进，大造声势，交流经验，相互促进。这样，全厂你追我赶，热气腾腾，学习班越办越有劲。
      三，及时总结，巩固成果。每期学习班结束，都作个简单的小结，发扬优点，吸取教训。小结的时候，也贯彻了从群众中来到群众中去的原则，充分发动群众自己做总结，再由他们自己去推广。学习班结束后，不是一散了事，而是把群众性的活学活用毛主席著作和斗私批修坚持下去。现在，凡是参加过学习班学习的工人，大都能自觉地坚持学习。
    上海《文汇报》发表的编者按语指出，基层单位办群众性的毛泽东思想学习班以业余为主，符合广大革命群众活学活用毛主席著作，开展斗私批修的强烈愿望。现在，广大革命群众迫切要求参加毛泽东思想学习班学习。但是，大量人员脱产学习，毕竟要受各种条件的限制。以业余为主举办毛泽东思想学习班，可以普遍办，大量办，可以最大限度地满足广大群众的要求。以业余为主，也符合业余闹革命的精神。我们要办好脱产的学习班。但是，如果普遍地大量人员搞脱产学习，势必影响生产和工作。大办业余学习班，既利于普及，又有利于抓革命，促生产，促工作。
