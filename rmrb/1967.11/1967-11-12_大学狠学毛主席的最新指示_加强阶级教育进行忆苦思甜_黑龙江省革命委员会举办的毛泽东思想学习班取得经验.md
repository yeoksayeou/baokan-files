The first session of the Mao Zedong Thought study class organized by the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee has recently concluded. The main experiences gained from this study class are as follows:

1. Intensify the study of Chairman Mao's works and his latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles." The participants of the study class said that only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful ideological weapon, can one eliminate selfishness, summon courage, and dare to "fight to the death" in the struggle against selfishness; only then can one thoroughly criticize and eliminate revisionism and its poison. The participants of this study class repeatedly studied and understood Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles." They studied and applied Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle against selfishness, in the criticism of revisionism, continuously deepening their understanding and practicing what they learned. The small group meetings and full-class meetings were all about actively learning and applying Mao Zedong Thought.

2. Concentrate efforts on resolving the main contradiction. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In studying any process, if it is a complex process with more than two contradictions, we must use all our strength to find its main contradiction. Once we grasp this main contradiction, all problems will be solved." The study class followed this teaching from Chairman Mao, mobilizing the participants to openly discuss their real thoughts (i.e., contradictions) and focusing on resolving the fundamental contradiction of "selfishness first." Everyone consciously used the three shining examples of Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains, and the standards of "completely," "thoroughly," and two "extremes" to expose the cover of class struggle in their minds, openly reveal "selfishness," criticize "selfishness," and arouse deep hatred towards "selfishness." Everyone deeply felt that "selfishness" is the root of all evil. If "selfishness" is not eliminated, revisionism cannot be criticized.

3. Strengthen class education. The study class consistently carried out the class education of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness, organizing the participants to "recall and observe four times": recall the bitterness of the old society and observe the sweetness of the new society; recall one's own ideological changes after liberation and observe the path one has taken and the direction one has adhered to; recall the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao's boundless care and patient teachings, and observe whether one has been loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; recall the harm one has suffered from the bourgeois reactionary line and think of the greatness of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The "recall and observe four times" activity fundamentally aroused the proletarian feelings of the old cadres, and also gave the new cadres and Red Guards a profound class education, universally deepening their boundless love for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and enhancing their awareness of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism.

4. Implement the principle of the masses educating themselves and liberating themselves. The study class was organized by system and by unit, with the core leadership of the team and group democratically elected by the participants, and representatives of the participants were also invited to participate in the leadership of the study class. The learning activities were mainly conducted in small groups, with collective activities for the entire class as a supplement, and the forms were flexible and varied. Under the overall requirements of the class, the participants planned their own schedules, found their own gaps, put down their own burdens, and created their own experiences. The small group activities insisted on everyone discussing problems, everyone finding answers in Chairman Mao's works, and everyone drawing conclusions. Because of the implementation of these policies and methods, the study class achieved a combination of exposing "selfishness" and struggling against "selfishness," with exposure leading to struggle and struggle leading to further exposure; a combination of struggling against "selfishness" and criticizing "revisionism," through struggling against "selfishness" to thoroughly criticize revisionism; one person struggling against "selfishness," everyone helping, everyone "checking," and everyone improving together. In this way, the study class quickly created a wave of struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism, with everyone eager to struggle against "selfishness" and learning from those who struggle against "selfishness" well.

5. Closely connect with the current struggle and promote the in-depth development of the proletarian cultural revolution in one's own unit. The study class, on the one hand, invited the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations from the participants' units to the study class to introduce the situation and do work, and on the other hand, arranged for the participants to return to their units to report their learning situation and participate in actual struggles, applying the results of their learning to practice, learning and using at the same time.

    大学狠学毛主席的最新指示  加强阶级教育进行忆苦思甜
    黑龙江省革命委员会举办的毛泽东思想学习班取得经验
    据新华社哈尔滨十一日电　黑龙江省革命委员会举办的第一期毛泽东思想学习班，已在最近结束。这个学习班所以取得比较显著的效果，主要经验有五条：
    一、大学狠学毛主席著作，大学狠学毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”。参加学习班的学员们说，只有掌握了毛泽东思想这个强大的思想武器，才能排除私心，鼓起勇气，斗私心敢于“刺刀见红”，无往而不胜；才能把修正主义批倒批臭，并肃清其流毒。这个学习班的学员对伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”，做到了反复学习，反复领会，在斗“私”中学，在斗“私”中用，在批“修”中学，在批“修”中用，不断加深印象，不断对照实践。学习班的小组会、全班会，就是活学活用毛泽东思想的讲用会。
    二、集中力量，解决主要矛盾。毛主席教导说：“研究任何过程，如果是存在着两个以上矛盾的复杂过程的话，就要用全力找出它的主要矛盾。捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了。”学习班遵照毛主席的这一教导，发动学员大摆大亮活思想（即矛盾），并且根据学员中比较普遍存在的“怕”、“怨”、“难”的思想，着重解决“私”字当头这个实质性的主要矛盾。大家自觉地以张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象，以“完全”、“彻底”和两个“极端”为尺子，大揭自己头脑中阶级斗争的盖子，大亮“私”字，大批“私”字，激发学员对“私”字的深仇大恨。大家深深地体会到：“私”字是一切罪恶的根源。“私”字斗不掉，修正主义就批不倒。
    三、加强阶级教育。学习班自始至终贯彻进行忆苦思甜的阶级教育，组织学员“四忆四看”：忆旧社会的苦，看新社会的甜；忆解放后自己的思想变化，看自己走的什么道路，坚持的什么方向；忆党和伟大领袖毛主席对自己的无限关怀和谆谆教导，看自己是否作到了无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；忆自己受资产阶级反动路线的害，思毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英明伟大。“四忆四看”活动，从根本上焕发了老干部的无产阶级感情，使新干部和红卫兵小将也受到了一次深刻的阶级教育，普遍加深了对毛主席、对毛泽东思想、对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限热爱，增强了斗私批修的自觉性。
    四、贯彻群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己的原则。学习班按系统编队、按单位编队，由学员民主推选队、组领导核心，并吸收学员代表参加学习班的领导。学习活动以小组为主，全班性的集体活动为辅，形式灵活多样，不强求一律。在全班总的要求下，计划自己订，差距自己找，包袱自己放，经验自己创。小组活动坚持大家摆问题，大家从毛主席著作中找答案，大家作结论。由于贯彻了这样一些方针和方法，学习班做到了亮“私”与斗“私”相结合，亮中有斗，斗中进一步亮；斗“私”与批“修”相结合，通过斗“私”狠批修正主义；一人斗“私”，大家帮助，大家“对号”，共同提高。这样，学习班很快出现了斗私批修的热潮，个个争着斗“私”，并且向斗“私”斗得好的同志学习。
    五、紧密结合当前的斗争，推动本单位无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展。学习班一方面请学员所在单位的革命群众组织负责人到学习班介绍情况和做工作，一方面安排一定的时间让学员回本单位汇报学习情况和参加实际斗争，把学习的成果用到实践中去，边学边用。
