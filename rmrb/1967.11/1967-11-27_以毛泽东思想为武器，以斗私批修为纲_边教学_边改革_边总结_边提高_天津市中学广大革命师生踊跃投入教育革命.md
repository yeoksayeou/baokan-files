	Using Mao Zedong Thought as a Weapon, Struggling Against Self and Criticizing Revisionism as the Guideline
	Teaching While Reforming, Summarizing While Improving
	The Broad Masses of Revolutionary Teachers and Students in Tianjin's Middle Schools Actively Engage in the Educational Revolution

	Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, November 26th — The broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, cadres, and Red Guards in Tianjin's middle schools have resolutely responded to the call of our great leader Chairman Mao to carry out the proletarian educational revolution. In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, they have taken Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, and have made struggling against self and criticizing revisionism the key task. They have thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line, smashed the old educational system, and launched a mass movement of educational revolution characterized by teaching while reforming, summarizing while improving.

	All full-time ordinary middle schools in Tianjin's urban and suburban areas have resumed classes and made revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students have, in the process of resuming classes and making revolution, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to expose, denounce, and criticize the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev. Many revolutionary teachers and students have, through their personal experiences, denounced China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of advocating intellectual education first, college entrance first, grades first, and of separating education from politics, from labor, and from the three great revolutionary practices. Some students have also denounced the old educational system's persecution and exclusion of workers' and peasants' children. Through the exposure and criticism of the revisionist educational line, the class consciousness of the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students has been greatly heightened. They have deeply realized that whether or not to carry out the educational revolution is a major issue concerning the cultivation of successors to the revolutionary cause, and a major issue concerning the future and destiny of the state.

	In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, all schools have placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and more important than everything. Many schools have established the practice of studying Chairman Mao's works every day, based on teaching classes. Revolutionary teachers and students, with the help of the PLA comrades who are in charge of military training, have strengthened their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. They have learned from the PLA, emphasizing the four firsts and the three-eighths spirit.

	In the tide of educational revolution, the broad masses of revolutionary teachers and students, based on the principle of teaching while reforming, have, in the course of criticism, taught and learned. They have sent people to nearby factories and villages to conduct investigations and research, and have, based on the opinions of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, boldly proposed plans and ideas for educational reform. Tianjin's Yan'an Middle School, Third Girls' Middle School, Second Middle School, 105th Middle School, and 42nd Middle School have all explored initial plans and gained initial experience.

	In the course of the educational revolution, many schools have mobilized the masses, fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of revolutionary teachers, students, cadres, workers, and Red Guards, and have paid special attention to mobilizing the enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers. Many middle schools' revolutionary teachers have, in the course of criticism, taught, stepped out of their research rooms, gone to the students, and engaged in production labor, military training, social investigations, and big-character posters together with the students. In teaching, they have practiced the method of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers," acting both as teachers and students, combining teaching and learning, and improving and advancing together.

	To better lead the educational revolution in middle schools, the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group's Cultural and Educational Office, relevant units of the Tianjin garrison, Tianjin Municipal Education Bureau, and Tianjin Middle School Red Guards Revolutionary Committee have jointly established an educational revolution leadership body. Various districts and schools have also established teaching reform leadership teams.

    以毛泽东思想为武器，以斗私批修为纲
    边教学  边改革  边总结  边提高
    天津市中学广大革命师生踊跃投入教育革命
    新华社天津二十六日电　天津市中学的广大革命师生、革命干部和红卫兵小将，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席关于进行无产阶级教育革命的伟大号召，在复课闹革命中，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，彻底批判修正主义教育路线，大破旧的教育制度，掀起了一个边教学，边改革，边总结，边提高的群众性的教育革命的热潮。
    天津市区、郊区的全日制普通中学，已经先后复课闹革命。广大革命师生在复课闹革命中，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，对以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线进行了大揭发、大控诉、大批判。许多革命师生以亲身经历，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行智育第一、升学第一、分数挂帅、脱离政治、脱离劳动、脱离三大革命实践等滔天罪行。有的学生还控诉了旧的教育制度对自己的迫害和排斥工农子女等罪行。通过对修正主义教育路线的大揭发、大批判，广大革命师生的阶级觉悟大大提高。他们深刻地认识到：搞不搞教育革命，是关系到培养什么接班人的大问题，是关系到国家前途和命运的大问题。
    各学校在复课闹革命中，都把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。许多学校以教学班为基础，建立了天天读毛主席著作的制度。革命师生在担负军训任务的解放军同志的帮助下，加强了革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。他们向解放军学习，大抓四个第一，大兴三八作风。
    在教育革命的热潮中，广大革命师生根据边教学、边改革的原则，在批判中教，在批判中学，一面派人深入到附近的工厂、农村，进行调查研究，根据工人和贫下中农的意见，大胆地提出教学改革的方案和设想。天津延安中学、第三女子中学、第二中学、第一○五中学、第四十二中学等学校，都摸索出了初步的方案，取得了初步的经验。
    在教育革命中，许多学校放手发动群众，充分发挥广大革命师生、革命干部、革命工人和红卫兵小将的积极性，并且特别注意调动革命教师的积极性。许多中学的革命教师，一面在批判中进行教学，一面走出教研室，到学生中间去，和学生一起进行生产劳动，一起搞军训，一起搞社会调查，一起搞大批判。在教学上，实行“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的教学方法，既当先生，又当学生，师生结合，教学相长，共同改进，共同提高。
    为了更好地领导中学的教育革命，天津市革命委员会筹备小组文教办公室、天津驻军有关单位、天津市教育局和天津市中学红代会还联合成立了教育革命领导机构，各区、各学校也分别成立了教学改革领导班子。
