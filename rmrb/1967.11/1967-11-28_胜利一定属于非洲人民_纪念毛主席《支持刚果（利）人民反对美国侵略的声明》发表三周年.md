Three years ago today, at the critical moment when U.S.-led imperialism launched a military invasion of the Congo (Kinshasa), our great leader Chairman Mao issued a declaration of historic significance, supporting the Congolese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression.

Chairman Mao's declaration condemned the savage invasion of the Congo (Kinshasa) by U.S. imperialism, exposed the arrogant and aggressive ambitions of this most ferocious imperialist power in Africa and around the world, and strongly supported the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Congolese and African peoples.

Chairman Mao's declaration issued a great call to arms to the African people and people of the world, pointing out the path to victory over imperialism and its lackeys, greatly encouraging the fighting spirit and boosting the confidence of the revolutionary people of Africa and the world in their struggle for victory.

Chairman Mao's declaration is a powerful ideological weapon for all oppressed peoples and nations in their struggle for liberation.

Over the past three years, the anti-imperialist struggle of the Congolese people and the national independence movement in Africa have been advancing along the path indicated by Chairman Mao.

The patriotic armed forces of the Congo (Kinshasa) have repeatedly smashed the counter-revolutionary "encirclement and suppression" and "sweeping" campaigns of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and have steadfastly persisted in the path of revolutionary armed struggle. They have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war, are opening up rural base areas, building people's armed forces, and waging flexible guerrilla warfare. The anti-imperialist armed forces in Mozambique, Angola, Portuguese Guinea, Zimbabwe, and other regions are also continuing their struggle. Anti-imperialist armed struggle is further deepening and gradually spreading to southern Africa, with even previously relatively quiet areas now echoing with the sounds of resistance against imperialism and neo-colonialism. The peoples of countries that have already gained independence are also continuing to advance in their struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism.

Three hundred million Africans have awakened as never before, filled with revolutionary vigor, and are fighting to smash the shackles of imperialism and build a new, free, and liberated Africa. The former "Dark Continent" has become a vibrant, fighting continent.

Chairman Mao pointed out in the declaration: "The U.S. imperialist armed invasion of the Congo (Kinshasa) is not only aimed at controlling the Congo but also at dragging the whole of Africa, especially the newly independent African countries, back into the net of U.S. neo-colonialism." The facts of the past few years have further proven that U.S. imperialism is gradually replacing the old colonialists and becoming the most ferocious enemy of the African people.

Led by the United States, the old and new colonialists have done evil in Africa. They have instigated counter-revolutionary military coups, carried out sabotage and subversion, and even sent troops to suppress, in an attempt to drag the already independent African countries back to the old colonial path. They have used various treacherous means, under the guise of "aid," to control African countries politically, economically, and militarily, and to strangle national independence movements through the United Nations. They have actively cultivated their agents, disguising these traitors as "national heroes" to dull the fighting spirit of the African people and sabotage and destroy the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people. U.S. neo-colonialism is using the Congo (Kinshasa) as its main stronghold and, through its puppet Mobutu, is rapidly expanding into Africa. The African people must finally break free from the net of U.S. neo-colonialism and drive out the old and new colonialists led by the United States to achieve complete independence and liberation.

In the fierce struggle between the African people and the imperialists and old and new colonialists led by the United States, the Soviet revisionist leadership has played the shameful role of the U.S. imperialist's henchman. It has been frantically advocating that African countries should "advance along the non-capitalist road through peaceful means." This is to fundamentally cancel the anti-imperialist revolutionary tasks of the African people, to extinguish the flames of the African people's armed struggle against imperialism, and to oppose the African people's continued struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism after gaining independence. It has colluded with the U.S. imperialists to sabotage the national liberation movements of the Congolese and other countries, and has attempted to strangle the anti-aggression struggles of the Arab peoples. It has also, under the guise of "aid," used every means to infiltrate the continent and expand its neo-colonialist influence.

The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has committed heinous crimes in Africa, causing serious harm to the national liberation movements of the Congo (Kinshasa) and Africa. The bitter lessons have made the Congolese and African peoples understand that while opposing imperialism, they must also oppose the Soviet revisionist traitor clique.

Chairman Mao pointed out in the declaration: "Strengthen national unity and persist in long-term struggle; the Congolese people will be victorious, and U.S. imperialism will be defeated." This judgment of Chairman Mao has great significance for the entire anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle in Africa.

The rule of imperialism led by the United States in Africa is accelerating its collapse. The more they are on the brink of death, the more they will desperately cling to the colonial territories that sustain them and struggle and counterattack. Therefore, the anti-imperialist revolutionary tasks facing the African people are very arduous. The African people must wage a long struggle to achieve complete liberation. In the course of the African people's advance, they will encounter various twists and turns. However, as long as the African people are indomitable and persist in the struggle, they will surely win the final victory.

The just struggles of the peoples of all countries have always been mutually encouraging and supportive. The Chinese people and the people of the world resolutely support the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the Congolese and African peoples. The struggle of the Congolese and African peoples is also a great encouragement and support to the peoples of all countries in the world.

Chairman Mao pointed out in the declaration: "U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the people of the world." "The hands of U.S. imperialism have stretched too far. Every place it invades, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the encirclement of the people of the world."

U.S. imperialism struts and frets everywhere, but it is not as powerful as it seems. It is a paper tiger. The aggression of U.S. imperialism can be defeated. This truth has been proven by the struggle of the Chinese people, the struggle of the Vietnamese people, and will also be proven by the struggle of the Congolese and African peoples.

In the declaration supporting the struggle of the Congolese people, Chairman Mao issued a great call to arms to the people of the world: "The people of the world, unite! Defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their running dogs! The people of the world must have courage, dare to fight, fear no difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All devils will be destroyed."

We are now in a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The world is in a great situation. No matter how desperately the imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered on the Soviet revisionist clique, and the reactionaries of various countries struggle, they will ultimately be submerged by the surging tide of the people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist revolutionary struggle.

Africa will surely belong to the African people!

The whole world will surely belong to the people of the world!

    胜利一定属于非洲人民
    ——纪念毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年
    三年前的今天，当以美国为首的帝国主义武装侵略刚果（金）的严重时刻，我们伟大领袖毛主席发表了具有重大历史意义的支持刚果人民反对美国侵略的声明。
    毛主席的声明，谴责了美帝国主义对刚果（金）的野蛮侵略，揭露了这个最凶恶的帝国主义在非洲和全世界的狂妄侵略野心，有力地支持了刚果（金）和非洲人民的反帝革命斗争。
    毛主席的声明，向非洲人民和全世界人民发出了伟大的战斗号召，指出了他们打败帝国主义及其走狗的胜利道路，大大地鼓舞了非洲和全世界革命人民的战斗意志，增强了他们的胜利信心。
    毛主席的声明，是一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族争取解放的强大思想武器。
    三年来，刚果（金）人民的反帝斗争和非洲的民族独立运动，正是沿着毛主席所指引的方向胜利发展的。
    刚果（金）的爱国武装力量，不断粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的反革命武装的“围剿”和“扫荡”，胜利地坚持了革命武装斗争的道路。他们认真学习了毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想，正在开辟农村根据地，建立人民武装，展开机动灵活的游击战争。莫三鼻给、安哥拉、“葡属”几内亚、津巴布韦等地区的反帝武装力量，也在坚持斗争。反帝武装斗争进一步深入发展，并且逐渐地向非洲南部蔓延，连过去一直比较沉寂的地区，也响起了反抗帝国主义和新老殖民主义的枪声。已经取得了独立的国家的人民，也在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中继续前进。
    三亿非洲人民空前觉醒，充满革命的朝气，正在为彻底打碎帝国 主义的枷锁，为建立一个自由解放的新非洲而斗争。昔日的“黑暗大陆”，变成了生气勃勃的、战斗的大陆。
    毛主席在声明中指出：美帝国主义武装侵略刚果（金），“不仅在于控制刚果，而且要把整个非洲，特别是新独立的非洲国家，重新投入美国新殖民主义的罗网。”几年来的大量事实进一步证明，美帝国主义正在一步步地取代老殖民主义的地位，成为非洲人民最凶恶的敌人。
    以美国为首的新老殖民主义在非洲干尽了坏事。它们对新独立的国家策动反革命军事政变，进行破坏和颠覆活动，直到出兵进行武装镇压，妄图把已经取得独立的非洲国家拉回到殖民地的老路。它们玩弄种种阴险的手法，以“援助”为幌子，对非洲国家实行政治、经济和军事上的控制，假手联合国扼杀民族独立运动。它们积极培植自己的代理人，把这些民族败类乔装打扮成“民族英雄”，以麻痹非洲人民的斗志，瓦解和破坏非洲人民的反帝斗争。美国新殖民主义正在以刚果（金）为主要据点，并且利用它的傀儡蒙博托，加紧向非洲扩张。非洲人民只有最后冲决美国新殖民主义的罗网，把以美国为首的新老殖民主义统统赶出非洲，才能取得彻底的独立和解放。
    在非洲人民同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行的激烈搏斗中，苏修领导集团扮演了美帝帮凶的可耻角色。它拚命鼓吹非洲国家应当“通过和平方法，沿着非资本主义的道路前进”。这就是要根本取消非洲人民反帝革命的任务，扑灭非洲人民的反帝武装斗争烈火，反对非洲人民在取得独立后继续进行反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。它同美帝相勾结，竭力破坏刚果（金）等国人民的民族解放运动，并且妄图扼杀阿拉伯国家人民的反侵略斗争。它还在“援助”的幌子下，千方百计地挤进这个大陆，扩展自己的新殖民主义势力。
    苏修叛徒集团在非洲犯下了滔天罪行，给刚果（金）和非洲的民族解放运动带来严重的危害。血的教训，使刚果（金）人民和非洲人民懂得，在反对帝国主义的同时，必须反对苏修叛徒集团。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“加强民族团结，坚持长期斗争，刚果人民必胜，美帝国主义必败。”毛主席的这个论断，对于整个非洲的反帝革命斗争，具有十分重大的意义。
    以美国为首的帝国主义在非洲的统治正在加速崩溃。它们越是濒临死亡，就越要死死地抓住赖以生存的殖民地盘，进行疯狂的挣扎和反扑。因此，非洲人民面临的反帝革命斗争的任务是十分艰巨的。非洲人民要取得彻底解放，必须进行长期的斗争。在非洲人民前进的道路上，还会遇到这样或那样的曲折和反复。但是，非洲人民只要百折不挠，坚持斗争，就一定能够赢得最后的胜利。
    各国人民的正义斗争从来都是相互鼓舞、相互支持的。中国人民和全世界人民坚决支持刚果（金）和非洲人民的反帝革命斗争。刚果（金）和非洲人民的斗争，也是对世界各国人民的巨大鼓舞和支持。
    毛主席在声明中指出：“美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人。”“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”
    美帝国主义到处横行霸道，张牙舞爪，其实并没有什么了不起的力量。它是不折不扣的纸老虎。美帝国主义的任何侵略都是可以打败的。这个真理，已经为中国人民的斗争所证明，为越南人民的斗争所证明，也必将为刚果（金）和非洲人民的斗争所证明。
    毛主席在支持刚果人民斗争的声明中，向全世界人民发出了伟大的战斗号召：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    我们正处在以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。世界上是一片大好形势。不管以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏修叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义和各国反动派如何进行疯狂的挣扎，它们终将被人民反帝反修的革命斗争的滚滚洪流所淹没。
    非洲一定是属于非洲人民的！
    全世界一定是属于世界人民的！
