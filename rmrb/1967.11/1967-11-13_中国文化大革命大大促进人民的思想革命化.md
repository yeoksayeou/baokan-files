China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Kobe Branch of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation Joint Statement

The great proletarian cultural revolution has greatly promoted the ideological revolutionization of the people.

The joint statement points out that the U.S. imperialists are the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and the Soviet revisionists are the U.S. imperialists' number one accomplice; to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism.

Xinhua News Agency, November 10th: The China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the delegation from the Kobe Branch of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation visiting China issued a joint statement in Beijing today. The joint statement points out that the friendship forged in the struggle against the common enemy, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, between the peoples of China and Japan will definitely continue to develop.

The joint statement said that the delegation, through its visit and inspection in China, felt that the great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, is an unprecedented great innovation with profound world significance. The great proletarian cultural revolution has further promoted the ideological revolutionization of the entire Chinese people, making industrial and agricultural production leap forward, rapidly raising the level of science and technology, and advancing socialist economy in big strides.

The delegation felt that Mao Zedong Thought has gone beyond the borders of China and is illuminating the path to liberation for oppressed nations and peoples around the world.

The joint statement points out that U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the Chinese and Japanese peoples and the common enemy of oppressed nations and peoples around the world. The Soviet revisionists are the number one accomplice of U.S. imperialism; to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism.

The statement points out that the Sato government of Japan has always followed the U.S., fiercely anti-China, and is the most reactionary government among all post-war Japanese governments.

The joint statement points out that the main obstacles to developing friendly trade between China and Japan at present are U.S. imperialism, the Sato government of Japan, the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique, and the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist clique led by Miyamoto. However, they cannot stop the forward march of history. Both sides expressed their determination to adhere to the three political principles, three trade principles, and the principle of the inseparability of politics and economics in Sino-Japanese relations, and to resolutely fight against the aforementioned four aspects of the enemy, striving to develop friendly trade between the peoples of China and Japan.

Those who signed the joint statement were Wang Maochun, a responsible person from the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, and others, and Murakami Masajiro from the Kobe Branch of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade Friendship Trade Delegation visiting China and others. At the signing ceremony, Chinese and Japanese friends held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read Chairman Mao's teachings.
