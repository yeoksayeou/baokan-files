The article "The Struggle Between Two Lines in China's Countryside" fully expresses the sentiments of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in our commune. After studying it, we immediately held a discussion. Everyone felt in their hearts that having the most brilliant and great leader Chairman Mao's leadership is the greatest happiness for us poor and lower-middle peasants. Under Mao's leadership, we have smashed the various tricks and schemes of the Chinese Khrushchev, and through mutual aid teams and cooperatives, we have embarked on the happy path of the people's commune.

At the discussion meeting, poor peasant member Wu Xiuqing excitedly said: "The article 'The Struggle Between Two Lines in China's Countryside' is permeated with the brilliant thoughts of our dearest leader, Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts. It is a scientific summary of the struggle between the two lines in the countryside over the past decade." The chairman of the poor peasants' association in Yufan Brigade, Cui Yingzhen, said: After studying the article "The Struggle Between Two Lines in China's Countryside," our direction is clearer, and our eyes are brighter. We must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Through the discussion, everyone deeply realized that further criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside and eliminating its poison is a major battle task for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside.

At the discussion meeting, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Yufan Commune expressed their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev. Old poor peasant Li Dechai angrily said, "The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly claims that 'exploitation is saving people now, not allowing exploitation is dogmatism, exploitation is necessary now, and exploitation should be welcomed.' This is sheer nonsense! My family has been working for the landlords for three generations. My grandfather worked for the landlord all his life, but in the end, even three mud houses were seized by the landlord, and my grandfather was so angry that he died. My father could not live, so he had to flee and work, and later he fell seriously ill and could not be treated, and he died of hardship. The Chinese Khrushchev says that exploitation is saving people, which is heartless!"

At the discussion meeting, everyone refuted with ironclad facts the lies of the top walking capitalist roader who viciously attacked the people's commune: "Peasants have not benefited from the collective economy in recent years." Everyone said, from 1959 to 1962, under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Mao, relying on the superiority of the people's commune, we overcame three consecutive years of natural disasters, and collective ownership was unprecedentedly consolidated, and public accumulation increased universally. In 1964, we mobilized 3,000 labor troops in Yufan Commune to dig several hundred miles of drainage canals, laying a good foundation for achieving bumper harvests despite droughts and floods. In 1965, we encountered a severe drought that had not occurred in 23 years, lasting more than 240 days without a drop of rain. In the old society, this would have resulted in a total crop failure, but because of the people's commune, we still achieved a bumper harvest. The total grain output of the entire commune reached 11 million jin, doubling the normal year of 1957 before the establishment of the commune.

At the discussion meeting, everyone unanimously expressed: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev's promotion of "three freedoms and one contract," "exploitation is meritorious," "material incentives," and "the theory of the extinction of class struggle" and other fallacies in the countryside, uproot the roots of revisionism, and ensure that the socialist red mountains and rivers will never change color for thousands of years.

    用铁的事实批倒中国赫鲁晓夫
    北京市大兴县榆垡人民公社革命委员会
    《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇重要文章，完全说出了我们公社广大贫农、下中农和革命干部的心里话，我们学习了以后，立即举行了座谈。大家从心眼里感到，有最英明的伟大领袖毛主席的领导，是我们贫农、下中农最大的幸福。毛主席领导我们，粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫的种种阴谋诡计，经过互助组、合作社，走上了人民公社这座幸福的大道。
    在座谈会上，贫农社员吴秀卿激动地说：“《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章，贯穿着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉思想，是十多年来农村两条道路斗争的科学总结。”榆垡大队贫协主任崔英珍说：学习了《中国农村两条道路的斗争》这篇文章，我们方向更明了，眼睛更亮了，我们一定紧紧掌握斗争大方向，以“斗私，批修”为纲，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。通过座谈，大家深刻地认识到：进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村方面的反革命修正主义路线，肃清其流毒，是当前农村无产阶级文化大革命的一个重大的战斗任务。
    在座谈会上，榆垡公社的贫农、下中农对中国赫鲁晓夫无比愤恨。老贫农李德才愤怒地说，中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“现在剥削是救人，不准剥削是教条主义，现在必须剥削，要欢迎剥削”，这纯粹是胡说八道！我家三代都给地主扛长活，我祖父给地主扛了一辈子长活，结果连三间土房都被地主霸占去，我祖父活活被气死了。父亲那时也无法活命，只好外出逃荒，扛活，后来身得重病，无法治疗，活活的熬死了。中国赫鲁晓夫说什么剥削是救人，这简直是没有心肝啊！
    在座谈会上，大家用铁的事实批驳了党内头号走资派大肆攻击人民公社的谎言：“农民这几年从集体经济中间没有得到好处”。大家说，一九五九至一九六二年间，我们在毛主席的英明领导下，依靠人民公社的优越性，战胜了连续三年的自然灾害，集体所有制空前巩固，公共积累普遍增加。一九六四年，我们榆垡公社动员三千名劳动大军，挖了长达数百里的十几条排洪渠道，为实现旱涝保丰收打下了良好基础。一九六五年碰上了二十三年来没有过的大旱，持续二百四十多天没下透雨，如果在旧社会将是颗粒不收，但是由于有了人民公社，我们仍然夺取了大丰收，全公社粮食总产量达一千一百万斤，比公社化前正常年景的一九五七年提高一倍。
    在座谈会上，大家一致表示：要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想当武器，彻底批倒批臭中国赫鲁晓夫在农村所鼓吹的“三自一包”“剥削有功”“物质刺激”“阶级斗争熄灭论”等谬论，挖掉修正主义的根子，确保社会主义红色江山千秋万代永不变色。
