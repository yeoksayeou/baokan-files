The people's liberation armed forces in the southern Vietnamese province of Kontum have demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness and relentless combat, following their recent heavy artillery bombardment of the U.S. base in Dac To, by encircling and annihilating a U.S. battalion in the western part of the base. After suffering heavy losses in the artillery attacks by the people's liberation armed forces on November 15 and 16, the U.S. military commanders were extremely panicked and enraged, hastily dispatching troops to search the surrounding jungles. Seizing this opportunity, the people's liberation armed forces swiftly surrounded a battalion of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade in the deep mountains about ten kilometers west of Dac To on the afternoon of November 19. The soldiers, positioned on the densely forested mountaintops, launched a fierce barrage of mortar fire on the enemy, inflicting heavy casualties. The bewildered enemy repeatedly called for help from nearby U.S. bases via radio, but the U.S. helicopters sent to deliver reinforcements and ammunition were met with intense ground fire and could not land. By November 21, ten helicopters had been damaged. The U.S. jet bombers sent to support the battalion were also forced to drop their bombs on their own positions due to the intense ground fire and the proximity of the two sides, killing and wounding many U.S. soldiers.

The U.S. aggressors also dispatched a large number of troops to rescue the besieged battalion, but they were met with fierce sniper fire from the people's liberation armed forces hidden in the jungle, resulting in many casualties. According to reports, the U.S. side admitted that their casualties were severe, including many officers killed and wounded.

The battle is still ongoing. Meanwhile, in the vicinity of the Dac To base, the people's liberation armed forces have been continuously attacking and ambushing the enemy over the past few days, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on November 22, the Viet Cong guerrillas in the provinces of Tien Giang, Soc Trang, Thua Thien, Ninh Thuan, Lam Dong, Long An, and Quang Tri in South Vietnam have been fighting bravely and intelligently, striking hard at American air pirates. In the 24 days up to November 15, they shot down 14 U.S. aircraft and killed many American air pirates.

In addition, the American aggressors admitted on November 15 that three of their helicopters were shot down by Viet Cong guerrillas, one of which crashed in the northwest of Tam Ky County, Quang Nam Province, killing eight American soldiers, and the other two crashed in the southwest of Da Lat, 40 kilometers away.

    新华社河内二十一日电　越南南方昆嵩省人民解放武装力量发扬不怕疲劳、连续作战的精神，继不久前猛烈炮击德都美军基地之后，又在最近这几天内在这个基地的西面围歼一个营的美国侵略军，给予敌人重大的杀伤。在人民解放武装力量十五日和十六日猛烈炮击德都美军基地，使敌人遭到重大损失以后，美军头目非常惊慌和恼怒，急忙派出兵力在这个基地四周的丛山中进行搜索。人民解放武装力量利用这个大好机会，在十九日下午，以神速的行动在德都以西十多公里的深山中包围了美国第一七三空降旅的一个营。战士们在森林茂密的山顶上，用密集的迫击炮火猛烈轰击敌人，给予大量的杀伤。被打得焦头烂额的敌人不断用无线电向四周的美军基地求救，但是，运送援兵和弹药的美国直升飞机受到人民解放武装力量的地面炮火猛烈射击，无法降落，到二十一日为止，有十架直升飞机被击伤。派去支援这个营的美国喷气式轰炸机也由于地面火力猛烈和双方阵地迫近而狼狈地把炸弹扔到了美军阵地上去，炸死炸伤了很多美军。
    美国侵略军还派出大量部队去救援这个营的敌人，但是一路上遭到了掩蔽在丛林中的人民解放武装力量战士们猛烈的狙击，被打死打伤了许多人。据报道，美国侵略军方面承认，在这次战斗中，美军伤亡严重，其中包括许多军官被打死打伤。
    现在，战斗仍在继续进行中。同时，在德都基地的周围，人民解放武装力量这几天来不断袭击和伏击敌人，使敌人遭到很大的伤亡。
    据新华社河内二十二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方堤岸省、朔庄省、同塔梅地区、西宁省、林同省、永隆省和承天省等省的游击队，英勇机智地战斗，狠狠打击美国空中强盗，在到十五日为止的二十四天内，共击落美国飞机十四架，消灭美国飞贼多名。
    此外，美国强盗在十一月十五日自己招认，有三架直升飞机被越南南方游击队击落，其中一架在广南省三歧县西北二十公里处坠落，八名美国鬼子毙命，另两架在大叻西南四十公里处坠毁。
