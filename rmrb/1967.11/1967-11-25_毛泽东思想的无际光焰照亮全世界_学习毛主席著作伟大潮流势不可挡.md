In the more than a year since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, China has published 25 foreign-language editions of Chairman Mao's works, totaling 4.6 million copies, distributed to 148 countries and regions around the world. In 55 countries and regions, 65 languages have translated and published 845 editions of Chairman Mao's works.

Revolutionary people from the five continents enthusiastically acclaim the widespread circulation of Chairman Mao's works. They praise them as "the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times," "bringing the issue of the working masses mastering Marxism-Leninism to the forefront," "marking the arrival of a new era of Marxism-Leninism—the era of Mao Zedong Thought," and "like food and weapons." They express their determination to "devote their entire lives to studying Chairman Mao's great works," and to "forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, forever under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, from victory to victory."

Xinhua News Agency, November 24th: Since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China began more than a year ago, it has been a period of widespread dissemination of Chairman Mao's works around the world. During this time, the quantity and scope of Chairman Mao's works published internationally have been unprecedented.

According to preliminary statistics, in the past year, the China International Bookstore has distributed 25 foreign-language editions of Chairman Mao's works, including Vietnamese, Burmese, Thai, Indonesian, Hindi, Japanese, Urdu, Persian, Arabic, Nepali, Mongolian, Swahili, Spanish, Albanian, English, French, Russian, German, Italian, Portuguese, Norwegian, Dutch, Hausa, Korean, and Esperanto, totaling 4.6 million copies. This distribution volume exceeds the total amount of Chairman Mao's works distributed abroad in the 17 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China and is more than six and a half times the amount distributed in the same period of 1964-1965.

In addition, according to incomplete statistics, there are 55 countries and regions around the world that have independently translated and published 845 editions of Chairman Mao's works in 65 languages. Among them, there are 43 complete sets of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong," 802 editions of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," "Three Articles," selected works, and single-volume works. The number of Chairman Mao's works, poems, and speeches published in newspapers and magazines is countless.

Currently, various foreign-language editions of Chairman Mao's works published in China have spread to 148 countries and regions across the five continents. From the smoky jungles of Southeast Asia to the high mountains of the Andes in South America, from the southern tip of Africa to the northernmost part of the Earth in Iceland, the golden light of Chairman Mao's works shines everywhere.

At present, in many countries, Chairman Mao's works have become the most popular books among the broad masses of the people. Some bookstores often receive Chairman Mao's works and, before they can be displayed on the shelves, these precious books are snatched up by readers in a few hours or even minutes. Some bookstores have long lines of readers outside their doors every day, frequently inquiring about the sale of these precious books. As soon as the news of the publication of the foreign-language edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" spreads abroad, orders and telegrams quickly pour in from all over the world. Readers' letters, like snowflakes, express the same wish: to quickly obtain the red treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Many countries' bookstores have repeatedly written to place orders, and the quantity of orders increases with each order. A Japanese reader wrote in a letter: "The enthusiasm of the Japanese people buying this book is unprecedented. I believe that every year, more and more young people will want this book."

Revolutionary people around the world, who are engaged in a life-and-death struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries, eagerly hope to obtain Chairman Mao's revolutionary treasure books as soon as possible. An Asian friend wrote in a letter: "The earlier you send Chairman Mao's treasure books to the revolutionary people of the world, the earlier the world revolution will win victory." Another African friend, to express his urgent desire to obtain Chairman Mao's works, wrote in large Chinese characters at the top of his order letter: "Chairman Mao's works are like food and weapons." He wrote in his letter: "Please send me 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and works by Chairman Mao... I hope to receive them soon. These books will greatly help me and my African compatriots to study Mao Zedong Thought. To achieve thorough liberation from imperialist rule, we must act according to Chairman Mao's teachings and instructions." A Latin American friend wrote in a letter, earnestly requesting the China International Bookstore to send him a complete set of all the works of Chairman Mao that have been published. He said that everyone who wants to overthrow imperialism and overthrow the capitalist system of exploitation must read Chairman Mao's books.

The widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought around the world has shaken the globe. Revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically acclaim: "The widespread dissemination of Chairman Mao's works in the world 'has made a great contribution to the international communist movement' and 'has promoted the revolutionary cause of the people of the world.'" Revolutionary fighters and progressive publications in various countries highly evaluate the great significance of Chairman Mao's works in promoting the world revolution. The General Secretary of the New Zealand Communist Party, Wilcock, said that the theoretical works of Comrade Mao Zedong "unprecedentedly make Marxism-Leninism a daily guide and tool for millions of people," "bringing the issue of the working masses mastering Marxism-Leninism to the forefront." The Canadian monthly journal "Progressive Worker" pointed out in an article that Chairman Mao's works "constitute a milestone in the development of Marxism-Leninism, marking the arrival of a new era of Marxism-Leninism—the era of Mao Zedong Thought." Revolutionary people around the world, with the most sincere feelings and the most enthusiastic language, praise the brilliant Chairman Mao's works as "the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times," "the most sharp and powerful ideological weapon for the oppressed people of the world," and "an eternal beacon on the road to freedom and liberation for the oppressed people." Revolutionary people around the world recognize: by reading Chairman Mao's books, they can "draw great spiritual strength," "clarify their direction in the vast sea of revolution," and under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, "go to fight, overcome difficulties, and create a brand-new world." Many revolutionaries in various countries regard learning Chairman Mao's brilliant works as an extremely important task. They have expressed that for the revolutionary cause, they will "imprint Chairman Mao's teachings in their minds and dissolve them in their blood," and will "devote their entire lives to studying Chairman Mao's great works," and "forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution, forever under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, from victory to victory."

Many revolutionaries in various countries not only strive to study Chairman Mao's works themselves but also, despite difficulties and sacrifices, actively and bravely propagate Mao Zedong Thought, determined to plant the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world. A Syrian friend said: I think that Chairman Mao's works should be published in various languages to meet the needs of the people of the world, so that the torch of Mao Zedong Thought can illuminate every dark corner, so that the people of all countries know how to serve the people and how to win victory. A Japanese friend said: "In the future, no matter what difficulties and obstacles we encounter, we will seriously study Mao Zedong Thought and spread Mao Zedong Thought among the Japanese people." Some African friends said: In our country, if someone is found by the reactionary government to have a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," they will be sent to jail. Nevertheless, we still try every means to bring "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" back to our country.

In Colombia, a bookstore employee was repeatedly politically persecuted for actively spreading Chairman Mao's works and was even arrested. However, they were not discouraged. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "work is struggle" and Chairman Mao's words in the brilliant work "In Memory of Norman Bethune": "Our comrades must see achievements and light in times of difficulty, and raise our courage." They drew limitless confidence and strength from these teachings. Not long ago, in front of the so-called "democratic showcase" of British imperialism in London's Hyde Park, three ordinary revolutionaries from different countries were arrested by British police for selling "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

These three revolutionaries stood firm in the face of fascist violence, showing great courage and tenacity. In the bourgeois court, when the judge threatened them with fines and imprisonment, they fearlessly and justly rejected the judge's unreasonable verdict. Finally, they raised their arms in the court and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and other revolutionary slogans, making the reactionaries panic and discomfited. The farce performed by the British authorities in front of Hyde Park and their fascist atrocities in the court did not stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought but instead inspired more revolutionary masses to fight for the spread and defense of Mao Zedong Thought.

For more than a decade, there has been a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads in the work of distributing Chairman Mao's works abroad. China's Khrushchev is terrified and hates the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to death. To realize his wolfish ambition of restoring capitalism, he controlled the distribution work abroad through his agents in the publishing industry as early as the founding of the country, doing everything possible to sabotage the distribution of Chairman Mao's works, resist and sabotage the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and drastically reduce the distribution of Chairman Mao's works. At that time, feudalist, capitalist, and revisionist poisonous weeds were massively exported abroad, poisoning the world. Look at the following shocking contrast: The first batch of English editions of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume 4" distributed abroad was only 446 copies, while the first batch of the English edition of the black "Cultivation of the Self" was as many as 9,968 copies. This solid data is irrefutable evidence that China's Khrushchev and his accomplices frantically resisted and sabotaged the spread of Mao Zedong Thought around the world.

However, it is as easy to shake a tree as it is to shake a leaf. Mao Zedong Thought is an invincible great truth. People around the world yearn to learn Mao Zedong Thought, seeking the truth of anti-imperialism, anti-revisionism, and overthrowing the dark rule of reactionaries from it. This is an irresistible historical tide. Whoever opposes and obstructs it will be like a grasshopper blocking a car, and will eventually be crushed by the wheels of history. China's Khrushchev was exposed in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and his various conspiracies to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and its spread have completely failed. All reactionary forces in the world that oppose Mao Zedong Thought will not have a good end. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought will, with the vigorous development of the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, spread to every corner of the world.

    毛泽东思想的无际光焰照亮全世界
    学习毛主席著作伟大潮流势不可挡
    在无产阶级文化大革命开展的一年多来，我国出版毛主席著作外文版二十五种、四百六十多万册，发行到全世界一百四十八个国家和地区。五十五个国家和地区用六十五种文字翻译出版了八百四十五种版本的毛主席著作。
    五大洲革命人民热烈欢呼毛主席著作广泛发行。他们颂扬说：毛主席著作是“当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义的经典著作”，“把劳动人民群众掌握马克思列宁主义的问题提上了日程”，“标志着马克思列宁主义的新纪元——毛泽东思想的纪元已经到来”，“毛主席著作好比粮食和武器”，“早一分钟送到世界革命人民手中，就使世界革命早一分钟胜利”。他们表示要用“毕生精力来学习毛主席的伟大著作”，“永远跟着毛主席干革命，永远在毛泽东思想旗帜下，从胜利走向胜利”。
    新华社二十四日讯　中国无产阶级文化大革命开展以来的一年多，是毛主席著作在全世界广泛传播的时期。在这期间，毛主席著作在国际上发行的数量之多，范围之广，都是空前未有的。
    据初步统计，一年多来，由中国国际书店对外发行的毛主席著作外文版，有越、缅、泰、印度尼西亚、印地、日、乌尔都、波斯、阿拉伯、尼泊尔、蒙古、斯瓦希里、西班牙、阿尔巴尼亚、英、法、俄、德、意、葡萄牙、挪威、荷兰、豪萨、朝鲜和世界语等，计二十五种，共四百六十多万册。这个发行数量超过了建国以后十七年时间内毛主席著作对外发行量的总和，相当于一九六四——一九六五年同期的六倍半以上。
    此外，据不完全统计，世界上还有五十五个国家和地区用六十五种文字自行翻译和出版了八百四十五种版本的毛主席著作。其中有整套的《毛泽东选集》和《毛泽东军事文选》共四十三种，《毛主席语录》、“老三篇”、毛主席著作选编本和单行本共八百零二种。在报章杂志上刊载的毛主席著作、诗词和毛主席近年来发表的有关支持世界人民革命斗争的声明和谈话，更是不计其数。
    中国出版的各种文版的毛主席著作，现在已经遍及全世界五大洲的一百四十八个国家和地区。从硝烟弥漫的东南亚丛林到高山峻岭的南美洲安第斯山山区，从非洲的南角到地球北端的冰岛，到处都放射着毛主席著作的闪闪金光。
    目前，在不少国家中，毛主席著作已经成了最受广大人民群众欢迎的书籍。有的书店常常刚收到毛主席著作，还来不及陈列在书架上，这些宝书就在几小时甚至几分钟内被读者踊跃购买一空。有的书店门前，几乎每天都有大批读者在等候，不时有人前来询问出售宝书的时间，他们一听到有了毛主席著作的消息，便立即奔走相告，并成群结队地前去购买。在某个国家，有一家书店每当出售毛主席著作，就会吸引来大批读者，他们从店内一直排到大街上。当《毛主席语录》外文版问世的消息一传到国外，订书的信函和电报很快就络绎不绝地从世界各地发到中国。雪片般投寄来的读者来信都表达了同一个愿望：尽快地获得红色宝书《毛主席语录》。许多国家的书店还连续来信催订，而且订购数量一次比一次大。日本一位读者来信说：“日本人民踊跃购买这本书的盛况是史无前例的。我相信，今后每年要这本书的青年会越来越多。”
    正在同帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派进行生死搏斗的各国革命人民渴望着能早日得到毛主席的革命宝书。一位亚洲朋友在来信中说：“你们把毛主席的宝书早一分钟送到世界革命人民手中，就使世界革命早一分钟胜利。”还有一位非洲朋友为了表达他渴望获得毛主席著作的迫切心情，特地在订书的信上端正地写上“毛主席著作好比粮食和武器”十二个中国字。他在信中写道：“请寄给我《毛主席语录》、毛主席著作……，我希望很快就收到，这些书将大大帮助我和我的非洲同胞们学习毛泽东思想。为了从帝国主义统治下求得彻底解放，就要按照毛主席的教导和指示办事。”一位拉丁美洲朋友来信恳切地要求中国国际书店能把所有已经出版的毛主席著作，给他完整地寄去一套。他说，凡是想打倒帝国主义、想推翻资本主义剥削制度的人们都必须读毛主席的书。
    毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，震动全球。世界革命人民热烈欢呼：毛主席著作在全世界的广泛传播，“对国际共产主义运动作出了伟大贡献”，“推进了世界人民的革命事业”。各国革命者和进步报刊高度评价毛主席著作对促进世界革命的重大意义。新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯说，毛泽东同志的理论著作
  “史无前例地使马克思列宁主义的科学成为千百万人的日常指南和工具”，“把劳动人民群众掌握马克思列宁主义的问题提上了日程”。加拿大《进步工人》月刊在一篇文章中指出，毛主席的著作“构成了马克思列宁主义发展中的一个里程碑，它标志着马克思列宁主义的新纪元——毛泽东思想的纪元已经到来”。世界革命人民用最真挚的感情、最热情的语言赞扬金光闪闪的毛主席著作是“当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义的经典著作”，是全世界被压迫人民的“最锋利、最强大的思想武器”，是被压迫人民争取自由解放的道路上
  “永不熄灭的明灯”。世界革命人民认识到：读了毛主席的书，就能从中“汲取巨大的精神力量”，在革命的航程中“明辨自己在大海上的航行方向”，并在光焰无际的毛泽东思想鼓舞下“去进行斗争，克服困难和创造一个崭新的世界”。许多国家的革命者把学习毛主席的光辉著作列为一项极其重要的任务。他们纷纷表示，为了革命事业，要把毛主席的教导“印在脑子里，溶化在血液中”，要用“毕生精力来学习毛主席的伟大著作”，“永远跟着毛主席干革命，永远在毛泽东思想旗帜下，从胜利走向胜利”。
    许多国家的革命者不仅自己努力学习毛主席著作，而且不怕困难，不怕牺牲，积极、勇敢地宣传毛泽东思想，决心把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界。一位叙利亚朋友说，我认为，应当用各种语文出版毛主席著作以满足世界人民的需要，让毛泽东思想的火炬照亮一切黑暗的角落，让各国人民都懂得如何为人民服务，如何赢得胜利。一位日本朋友说：“今后不管遇到什么困难和阻挠，我们都要认真地学习毛泽东思想，并且要在日本人民当中传播毛泽东思想。”有的非洲朋友说：在我们国家里，谁要是藏有《毛泽东选集》，一旦被反动政府发现，就得去坐牢。尽管如此，我们还是想方设法要把《毛泽东选集》带回国去。
    在哥伦比亚，有一家书店的工作人员，因为积极传播毛主席著作而不断遭到政治迫害，有的还被捕入狱。但是，他们并不因此气馁，他们努力学习了毛主席关于“工作就是斗争”的教导和毛主席在光辉著作《为人民服务》中说的话：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”他们从这些教导中吸取了无限的信心和力量。不久前，在英帝国主义的所谓“民主橱窗”伦敦海德公园门前，三位不同国籍的普通革命者因为在那里出售《毛主席语录》而被英国警察逮捕。
    这三位革命者在法西斯暴力面前横眉冷对，表现得非常勇敢、顽强。在资产阶级法庭上，当法官用罚款和判刑来威胁他们时，他们毫无惧色，大义凛然地把法官的无理判决顶了回去。最后，他们还在法庭上振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁”和其他革命口号，使反动派张惶失措，狼狈不堪。英国当局在海德公园前面演出的一出丑剧及其在法庭上的法西斯暴行，非但阻挡不了毛泽东思想的传播，反而激励了更多的革命群众起来为传播和捍卫毛泽东思想而奋斗。
    十多年来，在毛主席著作对外发行工作上一直存在着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。中国的赫鲁晓夫对战无不胜的毛泽东思想怕得要死，恨得要命。为了实现其复辟资本主义的狼子野心，他早在建国初期，就通过他在出版界的代理人直接控制了对外发行工作的关口，千方百计地破坏毛主席著作的发行，抵制和破坏毛泽东思想的传播，拚命削减毛主席著作的发行量。而当时，封建主义、资本主义和修正主义的毒草作品却大量销往国外，流毒世界。请看下面一个惊人的对比：《毛泽东选集》第四卷英文版对国外的首批发行量仅四百四十六册，而英文版黑《修养》首批发行量竟达九千九百六十八册。这个确凿的数据就是中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙疯狂抵制和破坏毛泽东思想在全世界传播的不容抵赖的罪证。
    然而，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。毛泽东思想是不可战胜的伟大真理。全世界人民渴望学习毛泽东思想，从中寻求反帝、反修、推翻反动派黑暗统治的真理。这是一股汹涌澎湃、势不可挡的历史潮流。谁要反对和阻挠它，谁就会象挡车的螳臂，终将被历史前进的车轮碾得粉碎。中国赫鲁晓夫在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中被揪出来了，他企图反对毛泽东思想及其传播的种种阴谋已经彻底破产。世界上所有反对毛泽东思想的反动势力也决不会有好下场。战无不胜的毛泽东思想必将随着世界人民革命斗争的蓬勃发展，传遍世界的每一个角落。
