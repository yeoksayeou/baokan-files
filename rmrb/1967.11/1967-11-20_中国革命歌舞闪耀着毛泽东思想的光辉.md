The Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe gave its first performance on the 16th at the National Indoor Stadium in Dar es Salaam, the capital of Tanzania. Over 1,600 people from various sectors of Tanzanian society enthusiastically applauded the Chinese revolutionary songs and dances, which shine with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

President Julius Nyerere of the United Republic of Tanzania and the Second Vice President Rashidi Mfaume Kawawa attended the opening ceremony and watched the excellent performance by the Chinese revolutionary artists.

At the opening ceremony, Peter Kisomo, Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, representing the Tanzanian government, warmly welcomed the visit and performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe in Tanzania. He expressed his belief that through this performance, the friendly relations between Tanzania and China would be further developed.

The Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, Zhou Boqing, also spoke. He said: The Chinese East Is Red Song and Dance Troupe was born and grew up under the guidance of the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought. It serves the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers through its revolutionary and combative songs and dances. He said that the performance of the Chinese song and dance troupe would further strengthen the friendship and mutual understanding between China and Tanzania, and contribute to the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among the peoples of Asia and Africa.

During the performance, whenever the radiant image of Chairman Mao appeared on stage, or when Chinese artists performed songs and dances praising Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the Tanzanian audience would always applaud and cheer enthusiastically, expressing their deep feelings for the great leader of the Chinese people and the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao.

Many revolutionary and spirited songs and dances left a deep impression on the Tanzanian audience. One viewer commented: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has innovated Chinese songs and dances, changing the entire stage appearance." When the stage showed African freedom fighters fiercely battling and ultimately defeating the enemy, the audience was deeply moved by this spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win. They cheered excitedly and applauded warmly. Many viewers told Chinese friends: "This is a very revolutionary performance, very inspiring." "Every item has educational significance and is full of revolutionary spirit."

At the end of the performance, President Nyerere and Second Vice President Kawawa warmly shook hands with the Chinese artists, congratulating them on their successful performance, and took a group photo with them.

Members of the Tanzanian National Dance Troupe also warmly embraced and shook hands with the Chinese performers. The artists of the two countries sang Mao's quotations and Tanzanian revolutionary songs together, repeatedly raising their hands and cheering "China, Tanzania" and "Tanzania, China."

The Chinese song and dance troupe arrived in Dar es Salaam by plane from Lusaka on the 13th. On the evening of the 15th, Zhou Boqing, the Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Tanzania, held a reception for Chinese artists, attended by about 500 Tanzanian guests, including Tanzanian government officials.
