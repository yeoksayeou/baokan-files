In places and units where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary policy of "three-in-one combination" must be implemented to establish a temporary power organ that is revolutionary, representative, and has the authority of the proletariat. This power organ is best named the Revolutionary Committee.

Red flags wave like the sea, and songs echo like the tide. People of all ethnic groups sing and dance in joy. The Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee is established.

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! You are the brightest red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups. At this moment of celebrating the establishment of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, we joyfully cheer for the great victory of your revolutionary line. We are determined to forever follow you from victory to victory.

The sun rises in the east, shining with countless rays. The east wind blows strongly, bringing good news. The triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought soars into the sky. The Revolutionary Committee is excellent.

The proletarian revolutionaries have the reddest hearts and the firmest wills. They are pioneers in revolution and production. With Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, they vigorously promote revolution and production.

The Red Guards, the young revolutionaries, love Chairman Mao's words the most. They implement revolutionary great unity and resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call to immediately resume classes and make revolution.

Most beloved Chairman Mao! The proletarian revolutionaries love you and are loyal to you without limit. We will forever advance in the direction you point out. Thousands of mountains and rivers cannot block us, and we can trample over surging waves!

Among countless treasures, Chairman Mao's book is the most precious. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and firmly safeguard the proletarian red regime.

    红太阳照亮了内蒙古草原（图片）
    在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的“三结合”的方针，建立一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的临时权力机构。这个权力机构的名称，叫革命委员会好。
    红旗似海，歌声如潮，各族人民载歌载舞齐欢笑，内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立了。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您是各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳，在庆祝内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立的时刻里，我们纵情欢呼您的革命路线的伟大胜利，我们决心永远跟着您从胜利走向胜利。
    红日东升，光芒万道，东风浩荡，喜传捷报。毛泽东思想凯歌冲云霄，革命委员会就是好。
    无产阶级革命派心最红，志最坚，革命是闯将，生产打先锋，用毛泽东思想来挂帅，狠抓革命猛促生产。
    革命小将红卫兵，毛主席的话最最爱听。实行革命大联合，坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，
    立即复课闹革命。
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！无产阶级革命派无限热爱您，无限忠于您，
    我们永远沿着您指引的方向前进，
    千山万水不能挡，惊涛骇浪能踏平！
    千宗宝，万宗宝，毛主席的书是宝中宝。我们要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把中国赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上批臭批倒，确保无产阶级红色江山牢又牢。
