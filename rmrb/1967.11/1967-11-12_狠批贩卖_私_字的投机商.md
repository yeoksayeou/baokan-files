	Severely Criticize the Peddlers of "Selfishness"
	Soldier of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Yang Ge

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The proletariat seeks to remake the world according to its own worldview, and the bourgeoisie also seeks to remake the world according to its own worldview." This old counter-revolutionary, Chinese Khrushchev, deeply understands that to seize power, one must first seize people, and to seize people, one must first seize their minds. For decades, he has stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois worldview, spreading the stinking theory of "suffering small losses to gain big advantages" everywhere to corrupt the souls of revolutionary masses.

	He pretends to be righteous when talking to young intellectuals: "I advise you not to fear suffering losses or hardships. Those who do not fear suffering losses can stand firm. Those who do not want to suffer losses in anything are not good, and are not very trustworthy." This whole spiel of his indeed poisoned many young students.

	Take myself as an example. When I was in school, I studied ancient literature and history diligently to become a writer in the future, neglecting the study of Chairman Mao's works and slacking off on ideological remolding. When we graduated from high school, there was a mistaken notion among my classmates that "getting into college is like ascending to heaven, and not getting into college is like falling into an abyss." I also wanted to go to college. Unfortunately, things did not go as planned. I didn't get into college, and my thoughts were troubled. I thought that was the end of it, twelve years of sitting on the bench wasted, and I would have to make a living by doing manual labor. Soon, the military recruitment began. I thought, farming has no future, so I might as well join the army. The army is a big school, and it's easy to get by there. I could "polish myself" there and then have a better chance of getting into college when I return. My "dream" would definitely come true. So, I joined the army with a personal calculator of selfishness in my heart.

	Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." I came to this great school of Mao Zedong Thought in the army, and through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and the help of my comrades, I made a firm decision to fight against my thoughts of fame and gain. In the struggle, I deeply felt that: only by firmly establishing the proletarian worldview of serving the people wholeheartedly can one be a noble person, a person of virtue, and a person beneficial to the people. Especially in this great proletarian cultural revolution that touches people's souls, through the great exposure, criticism, and struggle against Chinese Khrushchev, my class consciousness has been further raised. At the same time, I have more clearly seen the harm that Chinese Khrushchev's selfishness has done to me. Chinese Khrushchev is a big speculator of the "selfish" character, an enemy of the dictatorship of the proletariat. He spreads the fallacy of "suffering small losses to gain big advantages" to poison the youth, serving his ultimate goal of usurping the party and the country and restoring capitalism.

	Currently, hundreds of millions of military and civilian people across the country are carrying out a mass movement of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism." We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, fiercely fight against "selfishness," and severely criticize "revisionism." In our minds, we must establish a world of "publicness" and become red soldiers who are loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life.

    狠批贩卖“私”字的投机商
    解放军某部战士  杨戈
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”中国赫鲁晓夫这个老反革命深深懂得，夺权必先夺人，夺人必先夺心。几十年来，他顽固地坚持资产阶级世界观，到处宣扬“吃小亏，占大便宜”的臭理论，以腐蚀革命群众的灵魂。
    他装腔作势地对知识青年说：“我劝你们不要怕吃亏，不要怕吃苦。不怕吃亏的人才能站的住。凡是什么事情不愿意吃亏的人，那是不好的，是不大那么受信任的”。他这一大通黑话，确实毒害了不少青年学生。
    就拿我自己来说吧，上学时为了将来成为一个文学家，便苦钻古文、历史，忽视了毛主席著作的学习，放松了思想改造。高中毕业时，我们同学中间流传着“升上大学一步登天，升不上大学就掉进万丈深渊”的错误论调。我也是一个心眼想升大学。那知事与愿违。我没升上大学，思想可苦恼啦。我认为这下子算完了，白坐十二年板凳，只好靠打坷垃下苦力吃饭吧。不久，征兵开始了。心想，干农业活没前途，当兵吧，部队是个大学校，吃得开，在那里“镀镀金”，回来再升大学把握就更大了，“理想”就一定会实现。于是，就怀里揣着个个人主义的算盘入伍了。
    毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我来到部队这个毛泽东思想大学校里，通过活学活用毛主席著作和同志们的帮助，下决心狠斗了名利思想。在斗争实践中，我深深体会到：只有牢固树立全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级世界观，才是高尚的人，有道德的人，有益于人民的人。特别在这场触及人们灵魂的无产阶级文化大革命中，通过对中国赫鲁晓夫的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，我的阶级觉悟进一步提高了。同时，更清楚地看到了中国赫鲁晓夫利己主义对我的毒害。中国赫鲁晓夫是贩卖“私”字的大投机商，是无产阶级专政的死敌。他宣扬“吃小亏，占大便宜”的谬论，用来毒害青年，是为他篡党篡国、复辟资本主义的最终目的服务的。
    目前，全国亿万军民正在开展一场“斗私，批修”的群众运动。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，狠斗“私”字，猛批“修”字，在头脑里打出一个“公”字天下，做一个一辈子忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席革命路线的红色战士。
