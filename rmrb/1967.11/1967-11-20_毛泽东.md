    We must properly resolve the issue of the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots level to walk around and observe. We must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those who have the most practical experience.

    要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。    毛泽东
