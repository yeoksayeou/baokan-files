Title: The Soviet Revisionists' Another Great Betrayal of the Arab People

On November 22, the United Nations Security Council passed a so-called "British proposal." This proposal, bearing the British label, is actually a product jointly concocted by the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. It is another major conspiracy by the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to force Arab countries to surrender completely to the aggressors through the United Nations; it is another major deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Middle East issue after the Glassboro talks; it is another great betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership of the Arab people.

Under the manipulation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the United Nations has never condemned the aggression launched by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel in the Middle East in June this year, let alone taken any measures to stop it. However, after Israel occupied large tracts of Arab land, the United Nations forced Arab countries to accept a "ceasefire." This time, the Security Council's so-called "British proposal" continues to indulge the Israeli aggressors, without demanding that Israel withdraw immediately and unconditionally. On the other hand, the proposal demands that the invaded Arab countries "respect and recognize" the legal existence of Israel, the U.S. imperialist tool, allowing Israel to occupy more Arab land, ensuring the so-called "freedom of navigation" in the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran, and permitting the United Nations to further interfere in Middle Eastern affairs. This proposal is obviously an attempt to achieve the purposes that the U.S.-Israeli aggressors failed to fully achieve through their war.

The Security Council's proposal was able to pass because of the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership. Since the opening of this session of the United Nations General Assembly, the traitors Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have been closely colluding with U.S. imperialism while continuing to pressure Arab countries. Gromyko frequently met with Rusk, and Kosygin exchanged letters with Johnson, engaging in intense activities. Particularly noteworthy is that on November 20, the Soviet revisionist group proposed a hypocritical proposal demanding that Israel withdraw, but just two days later, when the U.S. representative stated that the British proposal "completely conforms" to U.S. policy, it hastily withdrew its own proposal and instead supported the British proposal. The double act performed by the Soviet revisionist leadership and U.S. imperialism at the United Nations once again exposed their deception of fake support and true betrayal.

To coordinate its betrayal activities at the United Nations, three days before the Security Council passed the "British proposal," the Soviet revisionist leadership also published an article in Pravda titled "The Near East Crisis." This article openly attacked the Arab people for adopting an "irresponsible" attitude toward Israel and, in the tone of a shameless charlatan, advised "Arab statesmen" to "remain sober" and "understand the actual situation." What do these words mean? They are a naked demand for Arab countries to kneel and surrender to the Israeli aggressors, stop their struggle, abandon their independence, sacrifice their sovereignty, and throw away their dignity, allowing themselves to be slaughtered and trampled by the new and old colonialists led by the United States and their lackeys. This article is not a perfect exposure of the traitorous face and accomplice role of the Soviet revisionist leadership?

The proposal passed by the Security Council has made the broad Arab people more clearly recognize that U.S. imperialism is their most vicious enemy, that the Soviet revisionist leadership is the biggest accomplice of U.S. imperialism, and that the United Nations is a tool of U.S. imperialism and a political bargaining chip for the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The oppressed peoples and nations can never entrust their liberation to the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle." Through their own struggle, the Arab people have further understood this great truth.

The contradiction between the Arab people and the new and old colonialists led by the United States and their lackeys is irreconcilable. This contradiction cannot be resolved by any deal between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership delude themselves that they can use a piece of paper from the United Nations to tie the hands of 100 million Arab people, extinguish the flames of anti-imperialist struggle, and stabilize the positions of new colonialism. This is absolutely impossible. The new aggression plots of U.S. imperialism and the new betrayal actions of the Soviet revisionist leadership can only arouse even stronger anger and resistance from the Arab people.

Currently, the national liberation movement in the Arab region is further developing. The Palestinian people, in order to liberate their homeland, are persistently waging a heroic armed struggle, striking the Israeli aggressors repeatedly. We are deeply convinced that if the 100 million Arab people unite closely and persist in a protracted struggle, they will definitely overcome all difficulties, defeat all enemies, and achieve final victory.

    苏修对阿拉伯人民的又一次大叛卖
    本报评论员
    十一月二十二日，联合国安理会就中东局势通过了一项所谓“英国提案”。这个提案，贴的是英国商标，卖的是美英苏三家共同炮制的货色。这是美帝和苏修串通一气，利用联合国逼迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者全面投降的又一个大阴谋；是美苏在葛拉斯堡罗会谈之后，在中东问题上进行的又一笔大交易；是苏修领导集团对阿拉伯人民的又一次大叛卖。
    在美苏的操纵下，联合国对于今年六月美帝国主义及其走狗以色列在中东发动的侵略战争，从来没有谴责一句，更没有采取任何措施来制止。而当以色列占领了阿拉伯国家大片领土以后，联合国却强迫阿拉伯国家接受“停火”。这一次安理会通过的所谓“英国提案”，更是继续纵容以色列侵略者，根本没有要求以色列立即无条件撤军。另一方面，这个提案却要求被侵略的阿拉伯国家“尊重并承认”美帝侵略工具以色列的合法存在，让以色列侵占更多的阿拉伯国家领土，保证苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡的所谓“通航自由”，并且允许联合国进一步干涉中东事务。这个提案，显然是企图实现美以侵略者发动战争想要达到而未能完全达到的目的。
    安理会这个提案所以能够被通过，是苏修领导集团叛卖的结果。勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒，从这一届联大开幕以来，就一面同美帝国主义加紧勾结，一面对阿拉伯国家继续施加压力。葛罗米柯同腊斯克接触频繁，柯西金同约翰逊书信往返，进行了紧张的活动。特别令人注目的是，十一月二十日，苏修集团曾提出一个假惺惺地要以色列撤军的提案，但是仅仅过了两天，当美国代表表示英国提案“完全符合”美国政策的时候，它就急急忙忙地撤销自己的提案，转而支持英国提案。苏修领导集团同美帝国主义在联合国合演的这一出双簧，又一次把它玩弄的假支持、真出卖的西洋镜拆穿了。
    苏修领导集团为了配合它在联合国中的叛卖活动，在安理会通过“英国提案”的前三天，还在《真理报》上抛出了一篇评论“近东危机”的文章。这篇文章，公然攻击阿拉伯人民对以色列采取了“不负责任的”态度，并且用一种走江湖的无耻之徒的腔调，劝说“阿拉伯的国务活动家”，要“保持清醒”，“理解实际局势”……。这些黑话是什么意思呢？就是赤裸裸地要阿拉伯国家在以色列侵略者面前屈膝投降，停止自己的斗争，放弃自己的独立，牺牲自己的主权，抛弃自己的尊严，听凭以美国为首的新老殖民主义及其走狗的宰割和蹂躏。这篇妙文，岂不是把苏修领导集团的叛徒嘴脸和帮凶面目暴露无遗吗！
    安理会通过的这个提案，使广大的阿拉伯人民更加认清美帝国主义是他们最凶恶的敌人，认清苏修领导集团是美帝国主义最大的帮凶，认清联合国是美帝国主义的工具和美苏的政治交易所。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”阿拉伯人民通过自己的斗争实践，进一步体会到这个伟大真理。
    阿拉伯人民同以美国为首的新老殖民主义及其走狗的矛盾，是不可调和的。这个矛盾，决不是美苏之间的交易所能解决的。美帝国主义和苏修领导集团妄想利用联合国的一纸决议来束缚一亿阿拉伯人民的手脚，扑灭反帝斗争的烈火，稳定新殖民主义的阵地，这是绝对办不到的。美帝国主义新的侵略阴谋和苏修领导集团新的叛卖行为，只能激起阿拉伯人民更加强烈的愤怒和反抗。
    目前，阿拉伯地区的民族解放运动正在进一步深入发展。巴勒斯坦人民为了解放自己的家园，坚持着英勇的武装斗争，给以色列侵略者以不断的打击。我们深信，一亿阿拉伯人民紧密团结起来，坚持长期斗争，就一定能克服一切困难，战胜一切敌人，取得最后胜利。
