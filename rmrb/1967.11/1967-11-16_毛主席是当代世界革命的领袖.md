The Federal District Committee of the Marxist-Leninist Movement of Mexico recently published an article titled "To Revolutionary Students," calling on revolutionary students to "first arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought among the masses, and to strive to apply it to the specific realities of our country."

The article emphasizes: "Comrade Mao Zedong, through the practice of the Chinese revolution, has creatively and comprehensively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. He has become the undisputed leader of the world revolution today. Therefore, when we talk about Marxism-Leninism today, it is basically about Mao Zedong Thought."

The article points out that only by relying on Mao Zedong Thought can the student movement take the correct path.

The article states, "Under the current conditions of the world, especially under the current conditions in our country, to depart from Mao Zedong Thought is to depart from the revolutionary path, to deny the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, to depart from the specific realities of the masses, and even to depart from thorough revolutionary practice. This is because only Mao Zedong Thought can reflect the specific conditions of the contemporary world, and only Mao Zedong Thought can propose a revolutionary line that suits these conditions. This is a truth proven by the history and practice of the world revolutionary movement over the past forty years."

The article points out that only by fully acknowledging the contemporary Marxism-Leninism and applying it to the specific practices of Mexico, can Mexican revolutionaries correctly guide the broad masses to the revolutionary path. Only by acknowledging this can Mexican revolutionaries clearly see and identify revolutionary forces and counter-revolutionary forces. Marxism-Leninism, raised to this stage, can be understood by the broad revolutionary masses and become a powerful material force for carrying out great revolutionary undertakings.

The article says, Mao Zedong, through creative and comprehensive development of Marxism-Leninism, has included a complete set of theories for the revolutionary struggles of oppressed nations and peoples, whose "main aspects are: building a new type of party that is completely different from traditional revisionist parties in ideology, politics, and work methods, and is closely linked with the masses; establishing a people's army under the absolute leadership of the party; establishing a solid rural base, developing people's war, and surrounding the cities from the countryside; implementing a united front policy that includes all classes and strata of society in the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle under the leadership of the proletariat, and establishing a people's democratic dictatorship that lays the foundation for the development of socialism. Without these basic strategic principles of Marxism-Leninism as the foundation, it is impossible to connect with the revolutionary masses and carry out thorough revolutionary practice."

The article emphasizes that the student movement is an important force for developing the revolution and is an important force for opposing imperialism, opposing the bureaucratic bourgeoisie and landlord government, and fighting for democracy; however, the student movement can only become a true revolutionary movement under the leadership of Marxism-Leninism; revolutionary students can only become a true revolutionary movement by arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and closely linking with the masses.

The article says, "True revolutionaries are tempered in practice; only by summarizing one's own experience on the basis of contemporary Marxism-Leninism can one become a revolutionary with the correct direction rooted in our country, and can one make a contribution to the new Mexican revolutionary movement."

The article says, "When armed with Mao Zedong Thought and directly in contact with practical life, the speed of learning will be a thousand times faster than in any university, and one will basically learn and find true thoughts, rather than ridiculous empty talk."

The article finally calls on conscious revolutionary students to go to the sea of class struggle to organize the masses and to organize themselves.

    墨西哥马列主义运动一区委会号召革命学生在群众中宣传毛泽东思想
    毛主席是当代世界革命的领袖
    新华社讯  墨西哥城消息：墨西哥马克思列宁主义运动联邦区委员会最近发表一篇题为《致革命学生》的文章，号召革命学生“应该首先用毛泽东思想武装自己，应该在群众中宣传毛泽东思想，并努力把它运用到国内具体现实中去”。
    文章强调指出：“毛泽东同志通过中国革命的实践，创造性地全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，他已成为当代世界革命无可争辩的领袖。因此，当前要谈马克思列宁主义，基本上就是谈毛泽东思想。”
    文章指出，只有依靠毛泽东思想，才能使学生运动走上正确的道路。
    文章说，“在当代世界的条件下，特别是在我国目前条件下，离开了毛泽东思想，就是离开了革命道路，就是否认马克思列宁主义的普遍真理，就是离开了群众的具体现实，甚至就是脱离了彻底的革命实践。”“因为只有毛泽东思想才能反映出当代世界的具体条件，只有毛泽东思想才能提出符合这种条件的革命路线。这是四十年来世界革命运动的历史和实践所证明的真理。”
    文章指出，只有完全承认当代的马克思列宁主义并把她运用到墨西哥的具体实践中去，墨西哥革命者才能够正确地把广大群众引导到革命道路上去。只有承认这一点，墨西哥革命者才能清楚地看到并识别革命力量和反革命力量。马克思列宁主义提高到现阶段，能够被广大革命群众所理解，并成为进行伟大革命事业的强大物质力量。
    文章说，毛泽东同志创造性地全面地发展了马克思列宁主义，其中包括提出了被压迫民族和被压迫人民进行革命斗争的一套完整理论，其“主要方面有：建设一个新型的在思想上政治上和工作方法上完全和传统的修正主义政党不同的、和群众紧密联系的马列主义革命党；创建一支在党的绝对领导下的人民军队；建立农村巩固的根据地，发展人民战争，以农村包围城市；实行包括反帝反封建的社会各阶级和阶层在内的在无产阶级领导下的统一战线政策，建立为发展社会主义打下基础的人民民主专政。如果不以这些马克思列宁主义基本战略原则为基础，就不可能联系革命群众，开展彻底的革命实践。”
    文章强调说，学生运动是发展革命的重要力量，是反对帝国主义、反对官僚资产阶级和地主政府、以及争取民主的重要力量；但是，学生运动只有在马克思列宁主义领导下才能成为真正的革命运动；革命学生只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，紧密联系群众，学生运动才能成为真正的革命运动。
    文章说，“真正的革命者是在实践中锻炼出来的；只有用当代马克思列宁主义基础总结自己的经验，才能成为有正确方向的在我国扎下根的革命者，才能对新生的墨西哥革命运动有所贡献。”
    文章说，“当用毛泽东思想武装起来，直接接触生活实际时，学习东西的速度就会比在任何一个大学快千百倍，就会基本上学到和找到真正的思想，而不是可笑的空洞的废话。”
    文章最后号召有觉悟的革命学生到阶级斗争的大海中去组织群众，并把自己组织起来。
