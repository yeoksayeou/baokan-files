On the occasion of the 23rd anniversary of Albania's liberation, we Chinese workers extend our highest respect to the heroic Albanian people and workers!

This year in April, I, along with the Chinese trade union delegation, visited the heroic country of Albania with a humble attitude to learn from our true friends and comrades. I witnessed firsthand the hardworking and brave Albanian people, under the wise leadership of their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania, adhering to the revolutionary policy of "one hand holding a pickaxe, the other a gun," self-reliance, and arduous struggle, independently building their own country and achieving brilliant victories. We Chinese workers are very happy and inspired by the brilliant achievements that our Albanian brothers have made in the cause of socialism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said, "Political work is the lifeline of all economic work." "Without a correct political standpoint, it is as if there is no soul." The reason why heroic Albania has become "a great beacon of socialism in Europe" and achieved brilliant victories one after another in the socialist revolution and socialist construction is due to the wise and correct leadership of the Party of Labor of Albania and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

The Party of Labor of Albania attaches great importance to the work of ideological revolutionization. Recently, it has taken a series of major revolutionary measures: opposing bureaucracy, cadres participating in physical labor, narrowing the gap between high and low wages, strengthening the construction of the people's army, full cooperation in agriculture, reducing private plots and livestock, developing mountainous areas, striving for self-sufficiency in grain, opposing backward customs and religious superstitions, cultivating revolutionary successors, and bringing guns and pickaxes onto the stage of literature and art, etc. All these measures have made people's spiritual outlook completely renewed, the enthusiasm for building socialism unprecedentedly high, and new people of communism emerging in large numbers. They put the interests of the state and the people above everything else, and regard them as the most important.

During our visit, we saw that their leading cadres were all working while leading. The average number of working days for general cadres is about 100 days per year, and grassroots cadres all participate in production, making it difficult to distinguish who is a worker and who is a cadre. Many cadres told us when we talked to them, "Comrade Enver Hoxha teaches us: 'Albania was born in revolution, Albania fights through revolution, and Albania achieved victory in socialism through revolution. We will also enter communism through revolution.'"

We also saw with our own eyes the heroic Albanian women making outstanding contributions to socialist construction. In the Durrës region, there is a carpet cooperative where only four of the workers are men, the rest are women. Many women also hold grassroots leadership positions in the state and enterprises. When we talked to many women, they said proudly: "We were the most oppressed and exploited before liberation. Now we have truly become the masters of society. We must, like our male comrades, share the burden of building socialism for the Party and the country."

The Albanian worker brothers, with their non-professional voluntary labor, built a 40-kilometer-long railway. They used their own hands and boundless wisdom to build one modern new factory after another after the Soviet revisionist group treacherously withdrew their experts. Some factories, which originally had only a few products, now have more than 100 kinds of products after a vigorous revolutionization movement. Especially in the field of oil extraction, they have used ironclad facts to smash the Soviet revisionist group's shameless lie that Albania is a "country without oil." Now, Albania's oil not only meets its own needs but also has surplus for export.

The Albanian peasant brothers voluntarily proposed to reduce private plots and livestock and, with a heroic spirit to overcome all difficulties, turned many barren mountains and saline-alkali lands into fertile fields. Some fields have a yield of nearly 1,000 jin per mu.

The heroic Albanian people have implemented ideological revolutionization. They dedicate themselves to the revolution, put the people first, fear no hardship, no fatigue, no difficulty, seek no fame, and no profit. This sublime ideology and revolutionary spirit have left an indelible impression on us everywhere.

What touched us most deeply was the Albanian People's Army, which, while defending the security of the motherland, maintains the fine traditions of the working people and achieves self-sufficiency in grain through their own efforts.

During our visit, what moved us the most was the Albanian people's boundless love and respect for their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha and our great leader Chairman Mao. They regard their party and leader as their mother. There is a folk song that goes: "Albania, how fortunate you are! Who leads you to the road of victory? It is Enver and our mother—the invincible Party, who leads us through dense fog and stormy rain, setting out on the journey. Like a red lantern, it shows us the way in the vast sea." In the same folk song, it also says: "Ah, Enver, you are a brave eagle, a true Marxist, you share the fate of strong Albania, you breathe with the great Chinese friend, wishing you and the great helmsman Chairman Mao eternal life!" What warm words, what deep proletarian feelings!

During our visit, we heard them say sincerely everywhere: "Comrade Enver Hoxha is our great leader. We must listen to his words. Wherever he points, we rush there." They also said: "Chairman Mao is the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionary people in the world, the great savior of all oppressed and exploited people. The 700 million Chinese people are our best friends. The friendship between China and Albania is everlasting. Your cause is our cause; your achievements are our achievements. We firmly support you and fight shoulder to shoulder with you." Everywhere we went, we heard them enthusiastically shout: "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live China-Albania friendship!" They regard Chairman Mao's badge as the most precious treasure and Chairman Mao's books as revolutionary treasures.

What we will never forget is that the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, when receiving our entire delegation, said: "Here, it is just like being at home. Do not feel any restraint." Comrade Enver Hoxha also said: "Our two parties share life and death, share fate. As long as there are our two parties in the world, there will be our friendship." These few words, though short, are full of meaning and power, giving us great encouragement.

Although our visit to Albania lasted only more than twenty days, it made me further realize that the heroic Albanian people are a great people. Their spirit of "preferring to die standing rather than live kneeling" is truly admirable. As our great leader Chairman Mao said in the congratulatory telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labor of Albania: "The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, the Yugoslav Tito clique, and all kinds of traitors and scoundrel cliques are nothing but a handful of yellow earth compared to you, while you are a towering mountain." The Albanian people are our true friends and comrades. We must learn from them the revolutionary spirit of "one hand holding a pickaxe, the other a gun," build our great motherland well, carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end; and further consolidate the unbreakable brotherly friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, making this friendship everlasting and coexisting with the sun and the moon.

    向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民致敬
    上海运输九厂五好工人　张文连
    当阿尔巴尼亚解放二十三周年光荣节日来临的时候，我们中国工人向英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和工人兄弟致以崇高的敬意！
    今年四月，我随中国工会代表团，抱着虚心向我们真正的朋友和同志学习先进经验的心情，到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚进行参观访问。
    我亲眼看到勤劳勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在自己伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会革命精神的鼓舞下，坚持“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”、自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命方针，独立自主地建设自己的国家，取得了辉煌的胜利。我们中国工人，对于兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民在社会主义事业中所获得的辉煌成就，感到十分高兴，十分鼓舞。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线。”“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”英雄的阿尔巴尼亚之所以成为“欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯”，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得一个又一个的辉煌胜利，这是由于阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志英明正确的领导。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党非常重视思想革命化工作。她最近又采取了一系列重大的革命化措施：反对官僚主义，干部参加体力劳动，缩小高工资和低工资之间的差距，加强人民军的建设，农业全面合作化，减少自留地和自留牲畜，发展山区，争取粮食自给，反对落后习俗和宗教迷信，培养革命接班人，枪和镐走上文艺舞台，等等，使人们的精神面貌焕然一新，建设社会主义热情空前高涨，共产主义新人不断涌现。他们把国家利益、人民利益看得高于一切，重于一切。
    我们在参观访问过程中，亲眼看到他们的领导干部都是在边劳动，边领导。一般干部的劳动日每年平均在一百天左右，基层干部都参加生产，分不清谁是工人，谁是干部。不少干部和我们谈话时说，霍查同志教导他们：“阿尔巴尼亚在革命中诞生，阿尔巴尼亚通过革命进行斗争，通过革命取得了社会主义的胜利。我们也将通过革命进入共产主义”。
    我们还亲眼看到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚妇女，在社会主义建设中作出了卓越的贡献。多勒斯区有一个毛毯合作社，全体工人中只有四个男工，其余都是妇女。还有不少妇女担任了国家和企业的基层领导工作。当我们和许多妇女谈话时，她们豪迈地说：我们在解放前受压迫最深，受剥削最重，现在才真正成为社会的主人，我们要和男同志一样，为党为国家分担建设社会主义的重担。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人兄弟以不脱产的义务劳动，修筑了长达四十公里的铁路。他们用自己的双手和无穷的智慧，在苏修集团背信弃义撤走专家后，建成一个又一个的现代化的新型工厂。有的工厂过去只有几种产品，经过轰轰烈烈的革命化运动，现在产品已达一百多种。特别是在石油开采方面，他们用铁的事实，粉碎了苏修集团曾断言阿尔巴尼亚是“没有石油的国家”的无耻谰言。现在，阿尔巴尼亚的石油不仅能全部自给，而且还有多余可以出口。
    阿尔巴尼亚农民兄弟主动提出减少自留地和自留牲畜，并以决心克服一切困难的豪迈气魄，把许多荒山和盐碱地，改造成良田，有的亩产量达到千斤左右。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民实行了思想革命化，他们一心为革命，一切为人民，不怕苦，不怕累，不怕难，不为名，不为利，这种崇高的思想和革命的干劲，到处给我们留下了不可磨灭的印象。
    尤其使我们深受感动的是阿尔巴尼亚人民军，他们在保卫祖国安全的同时，保持着劳动人民的优良传统，自己动手，做到了粮食全部自给。
    在参观访问过程中，最最使我们感动的是阿尔巴尼亚人民对自己伟大领袖霍查同志和我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇敬。他们把自己的党和领袖比作母亲，他们有一首民歌这样写道：“阿尔巴尼亚，你是多么幸福！是谁领导你走向胜利的道路？是恩维尔和我们的母亲——无比坚强的党，在密云浓雾、狂风暴雨中率领我们，踏上征途。就如同一盏红灯，在大海中指明航路。”在同一首民歌里又这样写道：“啊！恩维尔，你是勇敢的山鹰，是一个真正的马克思主义者，你与坚强的阿尔巴尼亚同命运，你与伟大的中国朋友共呼吸，祝你和伟大舵手毛主席万寿无疆！”这是多么亲切的言语，多么深厚的无产阶级感情！
    我们在参观访问中，到处听到他们无限忠诚地说：“霍查同志是我们伟大的领袖，他的话我们最要听，他指向那里，我们就奔向那里。”又说：“毛主席是全世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，是全世界被压迫、被剥削人民的大救星。七亿中国人民是我们最好的朋友。中阿友谊是万古长青的。你们的事业，就是我们的事业；你们所取得的成绩，就是我们的成绩。我们坚决支持你们，和你们并肩战斗。”我们每到一个地方，都听到他们热情地高呼：“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“中阿友谊万岁！”他们把毛主席的像章，当作最宝贵的珍品，把毛主席的书，当作革命的宝书。
    最使我们难忘的是，阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志接见我们代表团全体团员时说：“在我们这里同在你们家里一样，不要受任何拘束”。霍查同志又说：“我们两党是同生死，共命运，只要世界上有我们两党在，就有我们的友谊。”这几句语短情长的话，说得多么中肯，多么有力，使我们受到极大的鼓舞。
    虽然我们在阿尔巴尼亚的参观访问只有二十多天，但是使我进一步认识到，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民是伟大的人民，他们那种“宁愿站着死，不愿跪着生”的硬骨头精神是十分令人敬佩的。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中所说的：“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”阿尔巴尼亚人民是我们的真正的朋友和同志。我们要学习他们那种“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的革命精神，把我们伟大的祖国建设好，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底；并且要进一步巩固牢不可破的中阿两国人民的兄弟友谊，使这种友谊万古长青，与日月共存。
