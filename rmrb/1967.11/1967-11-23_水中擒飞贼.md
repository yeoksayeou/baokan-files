Not long ago, on one day, the military and civilians of Hanoi accurately struck down an American Phantom jet with their artillery. The jet, trailing thick smoke, plummeted towards the ground. At this moment, amidst the dense ground fire, an American bandit frantically jumped from the falling jet with a parachute to save his life.

"Quick, go catch the American bandit! The American devil is parachuting down!" Such shouts immediately echoed from every street. Militia, civil defense personnel, public security officers, and cadres, disregarding the enemy planes circling and diving, all rushed towards the place where the bandit was descending. The bandit finally landed in the bamboo-lined White Lake within the city. At this time, militia members with guns stood guard on the shore, and many people, not even bothering to take off their clothes, jumped into the water and swam towards the bandit. To quickly capture the bandit, many people went into the water to surround him, and some even temporarily tied bamboo into small rafts to join the fight.

People from all directions tightened the encirclement to capture the American bandit. This American bandit clung tightly to the white parachute, occasionally surfacing, terrified and shivering. Cadres and soldiers from a certain unit, Gao Hongchen and Li Yunzhi, were the first to swim near the bandit. Gao Hongchen raised his upper body out of the water, kicked with his legs, and grabbed the bandit's head, pulling him out of the water and twisting his right arm behind his back. Li Yunzhi closely cooperated, diving under the water to grab the bandit's legs. At this moment, the raft also arrived. Gao Hongchen pressed the bandit face down on the raft. Then, using the parachute's ropes, they tightly tied the bandit to the raft.

People pushed him to the shore. At this time, cheers erupted around White Lake: "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" "Down with American imperialism!" The bandit, shivering, crawled onto the shore and collapsed on the steps.

This is the shameful end of the American bandits. (Photo attached)

    水中擒飞贼
    不久前的一天，河内市军民以准确的炮火击中了一架美国的鬼怪式飞机。这架飞机拖着浓烟向地面坠落。这时，在密集的地面炮火中，一个美国飞贼慌慌张张地从正在坠落的飞机上跳伞逃命。
    “快去捉美国飞贼！美国鬼子跳伞啦！”这种呼喊声立即从各条街道发出来。民兵自卫队员、民防队员、公安人员、干部，不顾敌机的盘旋、俯冲，一齐向飞贼降落的地方跑去。这个飞贼最后落到了市区内的竹白湖里。这时，民兵自卫队员持枪在岸上警戒，许多人连衣服也顾不得脱就跳下水去，游向飞贼。为了尽快捉住飞贼，不少人下水围捕，还有些人临时用竹子绑成小竹筏参加战斗。
    人们从四面八方缩紧了捕捉美国飞贼的包围圈。这个美国飞贼死拉住白色的降落伞，一会儿冒出水面，魂不附体，直打哆嗦。某单位的干部和战士高鸿参和黎允职最先游近美国飞贼。只见高鸿参把上半身跃出水面，两腿一蹬，一把抓住飞贼的脑袋，把他提出水面，并把他的右臂扭向背后。黎允职紧密配合，潜下水去提起飞贼的两腿，这时，竹筏也推到了。高鸿参把飞贼面朝天地捺在竹筏上。接着，用降落伞的绳索把这个飞贼紧紧地绑在竹筏上。
    人们把他推到岸边。这时候，竹白湖周围爆发出阵阵吼声：“血债要用血来偿还！”“打倒美帝国主义！”这个飞贼战栗着爬上岸来，倒在石阶上。
    这就是美国强盗的可耻下场。（附图片）
