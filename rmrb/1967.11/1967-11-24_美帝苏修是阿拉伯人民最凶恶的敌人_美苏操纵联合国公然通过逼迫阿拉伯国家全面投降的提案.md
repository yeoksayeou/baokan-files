The U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists are manipulating the United Nations to openly pass a resolution forcing Arab countries to surrender unconditionally.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 23rd, under the joint manipulation of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitors, the United Nations Security Council on the 22nd passed a resolution forcing Arab countries to surrender unconditionally to the aggressors. This is the product of several months of intense conspiratorial activities by the U.S. and the Soviet Union, in line with the agreement reached between Johnson and Khrushchev at their secret meeting in Glassboro in June.

The resolution passed by the UN Security Council, nominally proposed by Britain, is in fact a pure American product. The U.S. representative to the UN, Goldberg, openly stated that the British proposal "completely conforms" to the policy of the U.S. government. The proposal does not stipulate that Israel must withdraw from all the Arab territories it occupied in this war of aggression, allowing the Israeli aggressors to remain. At the same time, the proposal demands that Arab countries accept a series of humiliating conditions, such as recognizing the existence of the U.S. imperialist tool, Israel; allowing Israel to occupy more Arab territories to achieve "reliable and recognized borders"; guaranteeing the "freedom of navigation" in the Suez Canal and the Strait of Tiran; and establishing "demilitarized zones" aimed at restraining the Arab people's anti-aggression efforts. In short, it is forcing Arab countries to submit to slaughter and surrender unconditionally. The proposal also stipulates the dispatch of a special representative of the UN Secretary-General to the Middle East to allow the U.S. to further interfere in Middle Eastern affairs through the UN.

This proposal is essentially the joint plan of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, which is the secret agreement reached between U.S. President Johnson and Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev at their secret meeting in Glassboro. After that meeting, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been intensely active for several months, trying to implement this plan. At the beginning of the 22nd UN General Assembly, Soviet revisionist Foreign Minister Gromyko went to the U.S. to have a secret talk with Rusk. Later, the Soviet revisionist group specially sent Deputy Foreign Minister Kuznetsov to the UN to engage in activities on the Middle East issue. It was reported that at the end of October, Khrushchev also secretly communicated with Johnson on the Middle East issue. On the eve of the Security Council passing the resolution, there were reports that Johnson and Khrushchev both personally exerted pressure on Arab countries through letters and other means.

At the UN Security Council meeting, the Soviet revisionist group once again played the trick of fake support and real betrayal. The Soviet revisionist representative pretended to demand that Israeli aggressor troops withdraw immediately and hastily proposed a resolution on the 20th, but two days later, they quickly withdrew this resolution and actively supported the British proposal. Soviet revisionist representative Kuznetsov openly advocated the various "principles" in the British proposal. The Soviet revisionist newspaper *Pravda* also jumped out on the 19th to openly attack the Arab countries for adopting an "irresponsible" attitude towards Israel, urging "Arab statesmen to remain sober," blatantly pressuring Arab countries to accept the U.S.-Soviet joint plan.

The Syrian representative spoke at the Security Council meeting on the 22nd, stating that they could not accept the British proposal. The Syrian representative pointed out that this proposal "recognizes the results of the aggressors' aggression" and "will give Israel more from the damage to Arab interests."

The U.S. and the Soviet Union's manipulation of the UN to bully Arab countries can only make the Arab people and the people of the world more indignant against U.S. imperialism and its number one accomplice, Soviet modern revisionism.

    美帝苏修是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人
    美苏操纵联合国公然通过逼迫阿拉伯国家全面投降的提案
    据新华社二十三日讯  在美帝国主义和苏修叛徒集团的联合操纵下，联合国安全理事会二十二日就中东问题通过了一项逼迫阿拉伯国家向侵略者全面投降的提案。这是美苏按照约翰逊同柯西金六月间葛拉斯堡罗黑会达成的协议，几个月来在联合国内外串通一气，进行紧张的阴谋活动的产物。
    联合国安理会通过的提案，名义上是英国提出的，但是，就其内容来说，是一个道道地地的美国货。美国驻联合国代表戈德堡公开声称，英国提案“完全符合”美国政府的政策。这个提案实际上没有规定以色列要从它在这次侵略战争中占据的阿拉伯国家全部领土撤走，纵容以色列侵略者可以继续赖着不走。同时，提案却要阿拉伯国家接受一系列丧权辱国的条件，例如承认美帝侵略工具以色列的存在；让以色列侵占更多的阿拉伯国家领土，以达成“可靠和得到承认的边界”；保证苏伊士运河和蒂朗海峡的“通航自由”以及建立旨在束缚阿拉伯人民反侵略手脚的“非军事化地区”等。总之，就是逼迫阿拉伯国家听任宰割，全面投降。提案还规定派遣联合国秘书长特别代表到中东去活动，让美帝可以通过联合国进一步干涉中东事务。
    这个提案，实际上也就是美苏的联合方案，就是美帝头子约翰逊同苏修头目柯西金葛拉斯堡罗黑会中达成的秘密协议。在那次黑会以后，美苏几个月来一直紧张活动，设法贯彻这个方案。在第二十二届联合国大会开始时，苏修集团外交部长葛罗米柯到美国同腊斯克密谈。以后，苏修集团又专门派遣副外长库兹涅佐夫到联合国就中东问题进行活动。消息透露，十月底柯西金还特别就中东问题同约翰逊秘密通信。在安理会通过提案的前夕，有消息说，约翰逊和柯西金都通过写信等方式，亲自出面向阿拉伯国家施加压力。
    在联合国安理会会议上，苏修集团又一次玩弄假支持、真出卖的把戏。苏修代表装腔作势地要以色列侵略军队立即撤退，还在二十日匆匆提出了一个提案，但过了两天便赶忙撤销这个提案，而积极支持英国提案。苏修代表库兹涅佐夫公开鼓吹英国提案中的各项“原则”。苏修《真理报》还在十九日跳出来，公然攻击阿拉伯国家对以色列采取了什么“不负责任的”态度，要“阿拉伯的国务活动家保持清醒”，露骨地逼迫阿拉伯国家接受美苏联合方案。
    叙利亚代表在二十二日安理会会议上发言，表示不能接受英国提案。叙利亚代表指出，这个提案“向侵略者表示承认他们的侵略成果”，“将从损害阿拉伯权益中使以色列获得更多东西”。
    美苏操纵联合国，如此欺负阿拉伯国家，只能使阿拉伯人民和世界人民反对美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏联现代修正主义的怒潮更加高涨。
