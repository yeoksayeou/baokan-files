The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Central Committee held an enlarged meeting from October 20 to 22. The meeting reviewed recent work, discussed, and determined some current tasks of the National Liberation Front. The meeting called on the military and civilians in the South to advance victoriously, to fully exert the advantages of proactive attacks, and to annihilate more enemies.

The Chairman of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, Nguyen Huu Tho, presided over this meeting. The meeting heard Nguyen Huu Tho's report on the situation in various aspects since the winter and spring of 1966-1967, Chen Nan Zhong's report on the military situation in the South in the summer and autumn of this year, and Huang Jin Fa's report on the impact of the publication of the political program of the National Liberation Front on the domestic and international fronts.

The meeting unanimously agreed that after the great and comprehensive victories achieved by the military and civilians in the South in the winter and spring of 1966-1967, the situation has developed further this summer and autumn, which is very favorable for the people of the South and very unfavorable for the enemy. The U.S. military has suffered heavy losses on various battlefields, especially on the Quang Tri-Thua Thien battlefield. The morale of the puppet army is increasingly low, and they cannot bear the "pacification" tasks. The enemy's rear is still in chaos, and the internal contradictions of the enemy are becoming increasingly sharp. After the winter and spring, the military and civilians in the South have exerted their initiative and offensive advantages, fought continuously, and achieved many major victories in military and political aspects. The People's Liberation Armed Forces have continuously grown and progressed in all aspects, the liberated areas have been further consolidated and expanded, and the political struggles of the people in various cities and temporarily controlled areas by the enemy have developed further.

The meeting highly praised the great victory of the publication of the political program of the National Liberation Front, which was passed by the extraordinary meeting of the National Liberation Front in mid-August, aimed at further consolidating and expanding the unity of the entire people, mobilizing all forces to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggression, and achieve a complete victory.

After analyzing the situation of the enemy and ourselves, the meeting determined the current tasks and proposed the requirements, proposals, and specific measures for the dry season of 1967-1968 to fully exert all the positive factors of the military and civilians in the South, mobilize all military and civilians to advance victoriously, fully exert the advantages of initiative, continuously attack the enemy in all aspects, and annihilate and consume a large number of U.S. troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops.

The meeting decided to solemnly commemorate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the National Liberation Front (December 20) throughout the South.

    越南南方民族解放阵线主席团举行扩大会议
    号召军民乘胜前进歼灭更多敌人
    会议听取阮友寿主席以及陈南忠和黄晋发所作的报告
    新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团从十月二十日到二十二日举行扩大会议。
    会议检查了最近工作，讨论和确定了民族解放阵线当前的一些任务。会议号召南方军民乘胜前进，大力发挥主动进攻优势，歼灭更多敌人。
    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿主持了这次会议。会议听取了阮友寿主席关于一九六六——一九六七年冬春季以来各个方面情况的报告，听取了陈南忠关于今年夏秋季南方战场上的军事形势的报告，听取了黄晋发关于民族解放阵线政治纲领的公布对国内和国际的影响的报告。
    会议一致认为，继南方军民在一九六六——一九六七年冬春季取得巨大和全面的胜利之后，今年夏秋季，局势有了新的发展，十分有利于南方人民，而十分不利于敌人。美军在各个战场上，特别是在广治—承天战场上遭到严重损失。伪军士气日益低落，担负不了“绥靖”任务。敌人的后方继续混乱不堪，敌人的内部矛盾日益尖锐。而冬春季之后，南方军民发挥自己的主动权和进攻优势，连续战斗，在军事和政治上取得了许多重大的胜利。人民解放武装力量在各方面不断壮大和进步，解放区得到进一步巩固和扩大，各个城市和敌人暂时控制地区的各阶层人民的政治斗争有了新的发展。
    会议高度评价由民族解放阵线非常会议在八月中旬通过的旨在进一步巩固和扩大全民大团结，动员一切力量，打败美帝国主义的侵略战争，夺取彻底胜利的民族解放阵线政治纲领的公布的巨大胜利。
    会议在分析敌我形势后确定了当前的任务，提出了一九六七——一九六八年旱季的各项要求、主张和具体措施，以便发挥南方军民的一切积极因素，动员全体军民乘胜前进，大力发挥主动优势，在所有各个方面连续进攻敌人，大量地消灭和消耗美军、伪军和帮凶军。
    会议决定在全南方隆重纪念民族解放阵线成立七周年（十二月二十日）。
