Heroic Albanian workers, under the correct leadership of the Party of Labour, persist in the proletarian dictatorship and the socialist path, have smashed the encirclement and blockade by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, and have implemented self-reliance and the mass line. In the struggle to build a modern socialist industry, they have achieved tremendous success.

Before liberation, Albania was a backward agricultural country in Europe. After liberation, Albania quickly healed the wounds of war and then, through three five-year plans from 1951 to 1965, built over a thousand large and small industrial and mining enterprises. Especially during the third five-year plan, the Albanian people overcame the enormous difficulties caused by the comprehensive blockade of socialist Albania by the Khrushchev revisionists and not only completed the industrial production plan but also built 403 industrial and mining enterprises and agricultural and cultural facilities. Currently, Albania's total industrial output has increased by more than forty times compared to the pre-war year of 1938. In other words, now, the industrial output of more than eight days is equal to the total industrial output of 1938.

Today, compared to 1938, the output of Albania's major industries has increased significantly: electricity by 68 times, oil by 32 times, coal by 143 times, chromium by 44 times, machinery by 77 times, building materials by nearly 48 times, light industry by more than 37 times, and food industry by 32 times.

Since liberation, especially in recent years, Albania's industrial structure has undergone significant changes. Previously, there were only some mining and some incomplete industrial sectors, which are now gradually becoming integrated. For example, the copper industry, which could only mine and smelt crude copper in the past, can now carry out the entire production process from geological exploration, mining, crude smelting, refining to manufacturing copper wire; the oil industry has a complete set of equipment from geological exploration, oil extraction to refining various petroleum products. In the power industry, a power grid covering the entire country has been built, and now the largest Ferri thermal power station in the country and the largest Vodeye hydroelectric power station in the country, designed and constructed by Albania itself, are being built. In the machinery industry, not only can various machine parts be manufactured, but some large and complex machines can also be manufactured. In the building materials industry, a complete set of building materials industry producing bricks, cement, asbestos pipes, and glass has been built. In the textile industry, the giant "Mao Zedong Textile Combine" will have a complete set of production equipment from spinning, dyeing, weaving to jacquard weaving after it is fully built. In addition, in recent years, some new industries that are extremely important for the development of the national economy and culture, such as the steel industry, chemical industry, and paper industry, have been established.

In recent years, Albania's industry has developed rapidly, primarily because the Albanian working class, under the correct leadership of the Party of Labour, has achieved the revolutionization of national life and people's ideology. Since last year, Albanian workers have extensively studied a series of documents from the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Council of Ministers on carrying out revolutionary measures, especially the documents of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and Comrade Hoxha's report on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" on February 6 this year, and have formulated various specific and feasible measures in conjunction with the specific situation of their units.

Currently, the situation in Albania's industry is excellent. Last year, industrial output reached its highest historical level. It is estimated that this year's total industrial output will increase by 11 percent compared to last year. Before Albania's National Day, good news is frequently reported from various places.

    坚持无产阶级专政　贯彻自力更生方针　粉碎帝修反封锁
    阿尔巴尼亚在工业化大道上阔步前进
    工业总产值比战前增长四十倍以上　广大职工社会主义觉悟大大提高
    据新华社地拉那二十七日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在劳动党的正确领导下，坚持无产阶级专政和社会主义道路，粉碎了帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派的包围封锁，贯彻自力更生和群众路线，在建设现代化社会主义工业的斗争中，取得巨大成就。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲落后的农业国。解放后，阿尔巴尼亚迅速地医治好战争创伤，然后，经过了从一九五一年到一九六五年的三个五年计划，建成了一千多个大小工矿企业。特别是在第三个五年计划期间，阿尔巴尼亚人民胜利地克服了由于赫鲁晓夫修正主义者对社会主义的阿尔巴尼亚进行全面封锁所造成的巨大困难，不仅完成了工业总产值计划，并且建成了四百零三个工矿企业和农业、文化设施。目前，阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值比战前的一九三八年增长了四十倍以上，也就是说，现在，八天多的工业产值相等于一九三八年全年的工业总产值。
    今天，阿尔巴尼亚各主要工业的产值同一九三八年相比，电力增长六十八倍，石油增长三十二倍，煤增长一百四十三倍，铬增长四十四倍，机械增长七十七倍，建筑材料增长近四十八倍，轻工业增长三十七倍强，食品工业增长三十二倍。
    解放以后，特别是近几年来，阿尔巴尼亚工业结构也发生了很大的变化。过去只有一些采矿和一些不成套的工业部门，现在这些部门已逐渐成龙配套。如制铜工业，过去只能开采和粗炼，现在已经能够进行从地质勘探、采矿、粗炼、精炼直到制造铜线的全部生产过程；石油工业有了从地质勘探、采油到提炼各种石油产品的全套设备。在电力工业方面，已经建成了密布全国的电力网，现在又正在加紧修建全国最大的费里火力发电站和由阿尔巴尼亚自己设计、自己施工的全国最大的沃德耶水力发电站。在机械工业方面，不仅能制造各种机器零件，并且已能制造一些大型复杂的机器。在建筑材料方面，建成了包括生产砖瓦、水泥、石棉板管和玻璃等花色品种较全的建筑材料工业。在纺织工业方面，巨大的“毛泽东纺织联合工厂”全部建成后，将具有从纺织、印染、色织到提花的全套生产设备。此外，近几年来，还建立了一些对发展国民经济和文化具有极其重要意义的新的工业，如钢铁工业、化学工业和造纸工业等。
    近几年来阿尔巴尼亚工业发展迅速，这首先是由于阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级在劳动党的正确领导下，实现国家生活和人的思想革命化的结果。去年以来，阿尔巴尼亚工人广泛学习了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议关于开展革命化措施的一系列文件，特别是学习了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的文件和霍查同志今年二月六日关于“党和政权的进一步革命化”的报告，并结合本单位的具体情况，订出了各种切实可行的具体措施。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚工业形势一片大好。去年，工业产值达到了历史最高水平。预计今年全年工业总产值将比去年增长百分之十一。在阿尔巴尼亚国庆前夕各地捷报频传。
