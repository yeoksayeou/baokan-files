Pakistan's *Rock* Weekly Says China Is the Greatest Banner-Bearer of the October Revolution

The Soviet Revisionist Clique Are Traitors to the World Revolution

According to a report from the New China News Agency in Rawalpindi on the 15th, the latest issue of *Rock* Weekly, published in West Pakistan, has published an article on the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The article states that under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the People's Republic of China is the greatest banner-bearer of the October Revolution. The Soviet Revisionist ruling clique, however, has betrayed the world revolutionary movement initiated by the October Revolution 50 years ago.

The article says that no one can deny that the People's Republic of China is now leading the anti-imperialist struggle of the Asian and African peoples, while the Soviet Union is colluding with the head of world imperialism, the United States, to oppose China.

The article says that the Soviet Union provides military aid to the Indian ruling clique, which is a lackey of imperialism. It supports the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia, another lackey of imperialism. It has recently played a disgraceful role in the aggression launched by the U.S.-Israeli alliance against the Arab countries. All these actions expose the true face of the Soviet ruling clique.

The article points out that a "socialist country" that bases its foreign policy on the so-called general line of peaceful coexistence with imperialism, rather than on the great principles of the October Revolution—proletarian internationalism—that is a shameful betrayal.

    巴基斯坦《顽石》周刊说中国是十月革命最伟大的旗手
    苏修集团是世界革命的叛徒
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第十五日电在西巴基斯坦出版的《顽石》周刊最近一期就十月革命五十周年发表文章说，在伟大领袖毛主席领导下的中华人民共和国，是十月革命最伟大的旗手，而苏修统治集团则背叛了五十年前十月革命所开创的世界革命运动。
    文章说，谁也不能否认，中华人民共和国现在领导着亚非人民的反帝斗争，而苏联却勾结世界帝国主义的头子美国来反对中国。
    文章说，苏联向帝国主义的走狗印度统治集团提供军事援助，它支持帝国主义的另一个走卒印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，它最近在美—以对阿拉伯国家发动的侵略战争中扮演了不光彩的角色，所有这一切都暴露了苏联统治集团的真面目。
    文章指出，一个“社会主义国家”把自己的外交政策建立在同帝国主义和平共处的所谓总路线的基础上，而不是建立在十月革命的伟大原则——无产阶级国际主义的基础上，那就是可耻的背叛。
