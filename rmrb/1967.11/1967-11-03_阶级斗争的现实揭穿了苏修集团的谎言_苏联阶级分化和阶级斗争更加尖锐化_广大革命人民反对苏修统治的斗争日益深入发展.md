The Soviet revisionist leadership strives to conceal the serious class struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat in the Soviet Union, claiming that all causes of human exploitation have been "completely eliminated" in the Soviet Union, and that only "friendly classes and labor groups" exist, whose interests are consistent in economic, social, political, and ideological aspects. In short, they use the false theory of the extinction of class struggle to cover up the bourgeoisie's attack on the proletariat.

The great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, pointed out: "Socialism is a fairly long historical stage. In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there exist the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there exists the danger of capitalist restoration."

In fact, since the victory of the October Revolution, class struggle in the Soviet Union has never stopped. The overthrown ruling class and the new bourgeois elements have been constantly fighting with the proletariat in covert or overt ways, attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship. After the Soviet revisionist leadership usurped the party and the state, the situation of class struggle in the Soviet Union underwent fundamental changes, with bourgeois dictatorship replacing proletarian dictatorship.

After the Soviet revisionist leadership came to power, a bourgeois privileged stratum emerged in Soviet society. This privileged stratum is composed of degenerate and corrupted elements from the leadership of party and government organs, enterprises, and state farms, as well as bourgeois intellectuals. This privileged stratum is the main social base of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionist leadership is their political representative. This privileged stratum, which accounts for only a few percent of the Soviet population, is completely opposed to the vast majority of workers, peasants, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals. The relationship between them is one of exploitation and being exploited, oppression and being oppressed. The contradiction between them is the main contradiction in contemporary Soviet society, an irreconcilable antagonistic class contradiction.

The bourgeois privileged stratum has turned the state power they control into a tool for oppressing and ruling the people, implementing bourgeois dictatorship. They tightly control the military, continuously strengthen police measures, deploy plainclothes agents nationwide, establish numerous concentration camps, and brutally suppress the discontent and resistance of the working people. They promote counter-revolutionary culture, vigorously advocate bourgeois reactionary ideas to corrupt and poison the Soviet people. They use their control over the means of production and means of subsistence to brutally exploit and oppress the vast majority of the Soviet people. Especially in recent years, the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has issued a series of decrees, resolutions, and regulations, thoroughly restoring capitalism, which has further intensified class division and class struggle in the Soviet Union.

Currently, Soviet state-owned industrial and commercial enterprises have changed in nature, from socialist enterprises to enterprises owned by the privileged stratum. The leaders of these enterprises hold absolute power, act arbitrarily, and are arrogant. Some leaders even say, "I am the master, I can do whatever I want." They often take measures against those who are dissatisfied with them. The leaders of these enterprises engage in embezzlement, speculation, run underground factories, and black-market operations to make huge profits. Enterprise leaders use various means to embezzle the labor fruits of the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist clique has always implemented a high-wage policy for enterprise leaders, and the "new system" allows them to "self-determine" wages and bonuses, which are distributed based on wage ratios. The higher the wage, the more the bonus, making their embezzlement of the workers' blood and sweat even more brazen.

Soviet state farms and collective farms have degenerated into capitalist enterprises and kulak economies. At the same time, individual economies have developed maliciously. The agricultural and sideline products produced by individual economies nationwide account for more than half of the total output, especially potatoes, vegetables, meat, and eggs, which are mainly supplied by private economies.

With the disintegration of the collective economy and the development of private economy, a large number of new bourgeois elements and new kulak elements have emerged, and the polarization in rural areas has become increasingly serious. In many places, buying and leasing land, and hiring labor to cultivate private plots have already appeared. Under the encouragement and incitement of the Soviet revisionist clique, the situation of privately dividing and seizing state farm and collective farm land is very serious nationwide. Some leaders take the opportunity to appropriate a large amount of land and public property. For example, a brigade leader of the Daydanoff State Farm in Azerbaijan expanded his private plot by four times and also appropriated the orchards of the farm. The chairmen of the collective farms, experts, and other leading personnel embezzle the labor achievements of Soviet farmers, obtaining "remuneration" that is ten times or even dozens of times higher than that of the farmers.

Under the rule of the bourgeois privileged stratum, the vast majority of workers and peasants have become hired slaves. They have no right to speak in politics, and their work and life are in a position of complete insecurity. Enterprises, in pursuit of profits, often illegally lay off workers in large numbers, and the number of unemployed is increasing. Last year, the number of illegal layoff cases appealed to the court of the Latvian Republic reached more than six hundred.

The living examples in the reality of Soviet life expose the lies of the Soviet revisionist leadership's so-called "friendly classes" and "consistent interests," completely revealing their true face of implementing bourgeois dictatorship.

The vast majority of laborers, revolutionary cadres, and intellectuals in the Soviet Union will never talk about "friendly classes" and "consistent interests" with the Soviet revisionist clique. They hate the rule and exploitation of the bourgeois privileged stratum to the core. An old worker in Moscow angrily said: "Now our 'leaders' are the same as the capitalists and landlords before the October Revolution. We workers and peasants can only eat black bread and potatoes; they eat big fish, meat, milk, butter, drive high-level cars, and live in good houses. The more one works, the less one's wage; the less one works or even does not work, the more one's wage." The Soviet people use various means to resist the rule of the bourgeois privileged stratum. In many places, despite the suppression of the military and police, demonstrations and strikes have been held. In June of this year, the automobile workers in Chimkent, Central Asia, angrily attacked and burned the public security headquarters and a nearby police station. A large number of facts show that the struggle of the vast majority of laborers, revolutionary cadres, and intellectuals in the Soviet Union against the rule of the Soviet revisionist leadership is becoming increasingly deep and developing.

The Soviet people, who have the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, will surely draw new strength from the great thought of Mao Zedong and the great practice of the Cultural Revolution in our country, and smash the Soviet revisionist leadership that is riding on their heads.

    阶级斗争的现实揭穿了苏修集团的谎言
    苏联阶级分化和阶级斗争更加尖锐化
    广大革命人民反对苏修统治的斗争日益深入发展
    据新华社一日讯　本社记者述评：苏修领导集团极力掩盖苏联存在的资产阶级同无产阶级之间严重的阶级斗争，说什么在苏联已“彻底消灭了一切产生人剥削人的社会原因”，只“存在着友好阶级和劳动者团体，他们在经济、社会政治和思想等方面利益一致”等等。总之一句话，是用阶级斗争熄灭论的谎言来掩饰资产阶级向无产阶级的进攻。
    世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“社会主义社会是一个相当长的历史阶段。在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。”
    事实上，十月革命胜利以后，苏联的阶级斗争从未停止过。被推翻了的统治阶级和新产生的资产阶级分子，不断从各方面同无产阶级进行隐蔽的或者公开的斗争，力图颠覆无产阶级政权。在苏修领导集团篡党篡国以后，苏联的阶级斗争形势发生了根本变化，资产阶级专政代替了无产阶级专政。
    苏修领导集团上台后，在苏联社会上出现了一个资产阶级特权阶层。这个特权阶层是由党政机关和企业、农庄的领导干部中的蜕化变质分子和资产阶级知识分子构成的。这个特权阶层是苏修领导集团的主要社会基础。苏修领导集团是他们在政治上的总代表。这个特权阶层只占苏联人口的百分之几，同百分之九十以上的广大工农群众、革命干部和革命知识分子完全处于对立的地位。他们之间的关系是剥削与被剥削，压迫与被压迫的关系。他们之间的矛盾是目前苏联国内的主要矛盾，是不可调和的对抗的阶级矛盾。
    资产阶级特权阶层把他们所把持的国家政权变成了压迫人民、统治人民的工具，实行资产阶级专政。他们严密地控制军队，不断地加强警察措施，在全国各地密布便衣特务，设立了许多集中营，对劳动人民的不满和反抗实行残酷镇压。他们大搞反革命文化，极力宣扬资产阶级的反动思想，来腐蚀和毒害苏联人民。他们利用对生产资料和生活资料占有的支配地位，对广大的苏联人民进行残酷的剥削和压迫。特别是近年来，勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团发布了一系列的法令、决议和条例，全面彻底复辟资本主义，就更加使苏联的阶级分化和阶级斗争尖锐化。
    目前，苏联国营工商企业已经变了质，从社会主义企业变成了特权阶层所有制的企业。企业的领导人大权在握，专横暴戾，飞扬跋扈。有的领导人甚至说什么“我自己是主人，想怎样干就怎样干”。动辄对不满他们的人“采取措施”。企业的领导人贪污盗窃，投机倒把，开地下工厂，开黑店，牟取暴利。企业领导人利用各种手段侵吞苏联人民的劳动果实。苏修集团本来就对企业领导人实行高工资政策，“新体制”又规定他们可以“自定”工资和奖金，而奖金又是按工资比例发放的，工资越高，奖金越多，这就使他们侵吞劳动人民血汗的勾当更加肆无忌惮。
    苏联国营农场和集体农庄已经蜕化成为资本主义性质的企业和富农经济。同时，个体经济恶性发展了。全国个体经济出产的农副产品已占全国总产量的一半以上，特别是土豆、蔬菜、肉类、蛋类大部分是私有经济供应。
    随着集体经济的解体和私有经济的发展，产生了大批新资产阶级分子和新富农分子，农村的两极分化日益严重。不少地方已经出现了买卖和出租土地，雇工耕种自留地的情况。在苏修集团的怂恿和鼓励下，各地私分和侵占国营农场和集体农庄土地的情况十分严重。一些领导人借机把大批土地和公共财产据为己有。如阿塞拜疆日丹诺夫国营农场的一个生产队长竟把自留地扩大了四倍，并且把农场的果树也据为己有。农庄主席、专家及其他居于领导地位的人员，侵吞苏联农民的劳动成果，占有比农民高十倍甚至几十倍的“报酬”。
    在资产阶级特权阶层的统治下，广大的工农群众变成了雇佣奴隶。他们不仅在政治上没有发言权，工作和生活也处于毫无保障的地位。企业为了追逐利润，经常大批地非法解雇工人，失业的人越来越多。去年向拉脱维亚共和国法院上诉的非法解雇案件达六百件之多。
    苏联现实生活中的这些活生生的例子，用铁一般的事实揭穿了苏修领导集团所谓“友好阶级”“利益一致”的谎言，彻底地暴露了他们实行资产阶级专政的真面目。
    苏联广大的劳动人民和革命的干部、知识分子，是绝对不会跟苏修集团讲什么“友好阶级”和“利益一致”的。他们对资产阶级特权阶层的统治和剥削恨之入骨。莫斯科一个老工人愤怒地说：“现在我们的‘领导人’同十月革命前的资本家和地主一样。我们工人农民只能吃黑面包、土豆；他们吃的是大鱼大肉、牛奶、黄油，坐高级小轿车，住好房子。劳动越多的人工资越少，劳动越少甚至不劳动的人工资越多。”苏联人民采用各种各样的手段反抗资产阶级特权阶层的统治。不少地方不顾军警的镇压，举行了示威和罢工。今年六月中亚细亚奇姆肯特市的汽车工人曾愤怒地袭击和焚毁了市民警总部和附近的一个派出所。大量事实表明，苏联广大劳动人民同革命干部和革命知识分子反对苏修领导集团统治的斗争正在日益深入和发展。
    有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联人民，一定能够从伟大的毛泽东思想和我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大实践中吸取新的力量，把骑在他们头上的苏修领导集团打个稀巴烂。
