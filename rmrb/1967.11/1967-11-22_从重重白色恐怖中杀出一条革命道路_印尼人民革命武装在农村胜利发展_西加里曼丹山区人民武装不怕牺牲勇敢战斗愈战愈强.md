From various messages coming out of Jakarta, it is evident that the revolutionary armed struggle of the Indonesian people is breaking through numerous difficulties and achieving victories in the rural areas of the archipelago. Even in the regions of West Java and South Sumatra, where the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime's control is the strictest, the torch of people's armed struggle has been lit.

So far, the revolutionary people of Indonesia have bravely launched armed struggles in the rural areas of major islands such as Java, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Sumatra to overthrow the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime.

According to reports, in the stronghold of the Indonesian fascist military regime, West Java, the local people with a revolutionary tradition have broken through the severe white terror. In the counties of Tasikmalaya and Banjarnegara, they have established armed forces and ignited the sparks of armed struggle. The mouthpiece of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Antara News Agency, admitted on October 23 with concern that a revolutionary force in the Tasikmalaya area is "fully armed." Recently, after engaging in a battle with the Indonesian fascist military, this revolutionary armed force quickly moved to the nearby Karasak Mountains. It is revealed that a people's armed force in the Banjarnegara County of West Java is currently active in the rural areas of this county. In South Sumatra, a people's armed force has also recently emerged.

According to reports from Indonesian reactionary newspapers, the people's armed forces active in the mountains of West Kalimantan are growing stronger with each battle. In October, they annihilated 50 enemy soldiers. The "Battle News" reported that this armed force recently engaged in a "most intense battle" near Menggala with the 328th Battalion of the West Java Military Region, which came to suppress the people's armed forces.

The message states that the people's armed forces fully utilized the advantageous terrain to severely strike the enemy. They demonstrated a spirit of fearlessness and bravery, engaging in a decisive, intense battle with the enemy for two hours at a distance of only 50 meters. According to the Antara News Agency, a people's armed force in West Kalimantan, after a two-hour fierce battle with the reactionary military on October 12, quickly moved to the forests of the Buduk region. Soon, this armed force ambushed the reactionary military's transport convoy in the Sanggildor region. The message admits that the people's armed forces concentrated their superior forces, utilized advantageous terrain, and launched a surprise attack on the enemy. In this ambush, the people's armed forces annihilated six enemy soldiers and seized some weapons.

    西加里曼丹山区人民武装不怕牺牲勇敢战斗愈战愈强
    新华社二十一日讯　从雅加达传出的一些消息表明，印度尼西亚人民的革命武装斗争正在千岛之国的农村地区，冲破重重困难，胜利发展。在苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权控制最严的西爪哇和南苏门答腊地区，最近也点起了人民武装斗争的火炬。
    到目前为止，印尼革命人民已在爪哇、加里曼丹、苏拉威西和苏门答腊等主要岛屿的农村地区，为推翻苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，英勇地展开了革命武装斗争。
    据报道，在印尼法西斯军人政权的老巢西爪哇，富有革命传统的当地人民，冲破了严重的白色恐怖，在牙律和邦牙冷岸等县建立了人民武装力量，点起了武装斗争的星星之火。印尼法西斯军人政权的喉舌安塔拉通讯社十月二十三日忧心忡忡地承认，牙律地区的一支革命队伍，是“全副武装的”。最近，这支革命武装队伍同印尼法西斯军队展开一场战斗之后，迅速地转移到附近的卡拉萨克山中。据透露，西爪哇邦牙冷岸县的一支人民武装，正在这个县的农村地区进行活动。在南苏门答腊最近也出现了一支人民武装力量。
    另据印尼反动报纸透露，活跃在西加里曼丹山区的人民武装力量，愈战愈强，十月份歼敌五十名。《战斗报》说，这支人民武装最近在孟加影附近同前来镇压人民武装力量的西爪哇军区三二八营进行了一次“最激烈的战斗”。
    消息说，人民武装充分地利用有利地形，狠狠地打击敌人。他们发扬不怕牺牲，勇敢战斗的精神，同敌人展开了两个小时、距离只有五十米的“决定性的激烈战斗”。据安塔拉通讯社透露，西加里曼丹的一支人民武装十月十二日同反动军队进行了两个小时的激战之后，迅速地转移到布杜克地区的丛林中。不久，这支人民武装又在桑吉勒多地区伏击了反动军队的运输队。消息承认，人民武装集中优势兵力，利用有利地形，出其不意地打击敌人。在这场伏击战中，人民武装歼灭了六名敌人，并且缴获了一些武器。
