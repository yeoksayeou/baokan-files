	China Has Become the Base for World Revolution

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, November 13th: On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, Somalian friends have written articles enthusiastically praising the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, for his creative inheritance and development of Marxism-Leninism on proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship, making extremely valuable contributions to the international communist movement.

	One Somalian writer published an article stating: "At the time when the world's revolutionary people are celebrating the 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution, the first socialist state established by the October Revolution is undergoing a capitalist restoration."

	The article states, "Due to Chairman Mao and the great proletarian cultural revolution he personally initiated and led, China has become a fortress and base for the world revolution and oppressed peoples and nations. The great proletarian cultural revolution in China has consolidated proletarian dictatorship, preventing China from changing color and degenerating into a bourgeois state like the Soviet Union."

	The article emphasizes: "With the brilliance and truth of Mao Zedong Thought, oppressed peoples and nations can achieve liberation. With the brilliance and truth of Mao Zedong Thought, people who have established proletarian dictatorship can consolidate this dictatorship. With the brilliance and truth of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of countries whose power has been usurped by Khrushchev and Brezhnev-style revisionists can overthrow this regime and re-establish proletarian dictatorship."

	A study group for Chairman Mao's works pointed out in an article they wrote: "The great retreat in Soviet history has posed a new problem for the international communist movement, that is, how can the proletariat, after seizing power, prevent capitalist restoration? How can the socialist revolution be carried through to the end in the sharp and complex class struggle? These are major issues that Marx and Lenin did not resolve."

	The article states, "The greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao Zedong, and the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution led by him in China have solved these problems in theory and practice, answering these questions through the revolutionary practice of hundreds of millions of people that has shaken the world."

    索马里朋友赞扬毛主席发动和领导的中国文化大革命
    中国已成为世界革命的根据地
    据新华社摩加迪沙十三日电  在纪念伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候，索马里朋友撰写文章热烈赞扬世界革命人民的伟大导师毛泽东主席创造性地继承和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的学说，对国际共产主义运动作出了极其宝贵的贡献。
    一位索马里作家发表文章说：“在世界革命人民庆祝伟大的十月革命五十周年的时候，在十月革命所建立的第一个社会主义国家正在复辟资本主义。”
    文章说，“由于毛主席和他亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，中国已成为世界革命和被压迫人民及被压迫民族的堡垒和基地。中国的无产阶级文化大革命巩固了无产阶级专政，使中国不会象苏联那样改变颜色堕落成为资产阶级的国家。”
    文章强调指出：“有了毛主席思想的光辉和真理，被压迫人民和被压迫民族就能够赢得解放。有了毛主席思想的光辉和真理，已经建立了无产阶级专政的人民就能够巩固这一专政。有了毛主席思想的光辉和真理，被赫鲁晓夫和勃列日涅夫式的修正主义者篡夺了政权的国家的人民就能够推翻这一政权，并重建无产阶级专政。”
    一个毛主席著作学习小组在他们写的一篇文章中指出：“苏联历史的大倒退，给国际共产主义运动提出了一个崭新的问题，那就是，无产阶级在夺取政权以后，怎样防止资本主义复辟？在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中怎样才能把社会主义革命进行到底？这些是马克思和列宁没有解决的大问题。”
    文章说，“当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席和他所领导的中国的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命在理论上和实践上解决了这些问题，通过亿万人民的震撼世界的革命实践回答了这些问题。”
