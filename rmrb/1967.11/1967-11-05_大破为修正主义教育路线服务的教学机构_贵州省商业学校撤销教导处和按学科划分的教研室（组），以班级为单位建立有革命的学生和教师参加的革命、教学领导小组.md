The revolutionary teachers and students of Guizhou Provincial Commercial School, in the course of resuming classes and making revolution, have emphasized proletarian politics, abolished the educational guidance office and the research groups (sections) divided by subjects, and established revolutionary and educational leadership groups at the class level, with revolutionary teachers and students participating. This has helped to promote educational reforms. Currently, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of this school are continuing to carry out revolutionary practices in educational reforms in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution.

Since March of this year, when Guizhou Provincial Commercial School resumed classes and made revolution, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have taken Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, raised the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticized the revisionist educational line, and firmly established Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Through the process of eliminating the influence of the revisionist educational line, the revolutionary teachers and students have come to realize that to thoroughly eliminate the revisionist educational line and firmly establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, it is necessary to correspondingly eliminate the educational institutions serving the revisionist educational line and establish educational institutions serving the proletarian educational line. Through criticism, the teachers and students recognized that the past educational guidance office and the research groups (sections) divided by subjects were educational institutions serving the bourgeoisie and the revisionist educational line. The teachers, while criticizing, also reformed, and actively went out of the research groups (sections) to the students, living with the students, studying with them, working with them, being both teachers and students, changing the past situation where teachers were detached from students. On this basis, after exploration, they established revolutionary and educational leadership groups at the class level, with teacher and student representatives participating, under the direct leadership of the school revolutionary committee, responsible for unifying the leadership of revolutionary and educational work in their respective classes.

After the new educational institutions were established in April this year, they were welcomed by the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school and initially showed their superiority. Their main advantages are:

First, since the revolutionary and educational leadership groups both grasp revolution and education, with revolution guiding education and politics guiding professional work, they have overcome the past phenomenon of teachers only managing education without involving politics. This is beneficial for emphasizing proletarian politics in education, strengthening the ideological and political work of teachers and students, and promoting the ideological revolution of teachers and students.

Second, it is beneficial for establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship in socialism. Since teachers and students are making revolution together, carrying out educational reforms together, preparing lessons together, teaching together, they have found common language and proletarian feelings, and teachers and students care for each other politically, ideologically, academically, and in daily life.

Third, it has changed the old teaching method of the teacher lecturing and the students listening, and established a new teaching method of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers." They have explored three democratic teaching methods in practice: students asking questions and teachers answering; students asking questions and discussing among themselves, with teachers providing guidance; teachers giving a central speech, followed by student discussions and summaries. This has created a new situation in the classroom where teachers and students teach each other and learn from each other.

Fourth, it has streamlined the organization and strengthened the front line of education.

    大破为修正主义教育路线服务的教学机构
    贵州省商业学校撤销教导处和按学科划分的教研室（组），以班级为单位建立有革命的学生和教师参加的革命、教学领导小组
    据新华社贵阳四日电　贵州省商业学校的革命师生，在复课闹革命中突出无产阶级政治，撤销教导处和按学科划分的教研室（组），以班级为单位建立了有教师和学生代表参加的革命、教学领导小组。他们这样做的结果，有利于推动教学改革。目前，这个学校的革命师生员工，正在按照毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，继续进行教学改革的革命实践。
    贵州省商业学校从今年三月复课闹革命以来，广大革命师生以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，高举革命的批判大旗，彻底批判修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。全校革命师生从肃清修正主义教育路线流毒的过程中认识到，要彻底破除修正主义教育路线，大立毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，必须相应地破除为修正主义教育路线服务的教学机构，建立为无产阶级教育路线服务的教学机构。师生们通过大批判认识到，过去的教导处和那种按学科划分的教研室（组），是为资产阶级和修正主义教育路线服务的教学机构。教师们边批判，边改革，纷纷走出教研室（组），到学生中去，和学生生活在一起，同革命，同学习，同劳动，既当先生，又当学生，改变了过去教师脱离学生的局面。在这个基础上，经过摸索，建立了有教师和学生代表参加的，以班级为单位的革命、教学领导小组，在校革命委员会直接领导下，负责统一领导本班级的革命和教学工作。
    新的教学机构在今年四月份建立后，受到了全校革命师生的欢迎，初步显示了它的优越性。它的好处主要表现在：
    第一，由于革命、教学领导小组既抓革命，又抓教学，以革命统帅教学，以政治统帅业务，克服了过去教师只管教学不问政治的现象，有利于在教学中突出无产阶级政治，有利于加强师生的思想政治工作，促进师生的思想革命化。
    第二，有利于建立社会主义的新型师生关系。由于教师和学生在一起闹革命，一起搞教学改革，一起备课，一起教学，互相有了共同的语言，有了无产阶级的感情，师生之间在政治上、思想上、学习上和生活上都相互关怀。
    第三，改变了过去先生讲，学生听的旧的教学方法，建立起“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的新的教学方法。他们从实践中摸索出同学提问题，老师作解答；同学提问题，自己讨论，老师从旁启发；老师作中心发言，由同学讨论，做总结等三种民主教学的方法，使课堂上出现了师生互教，教学相长的新局面。
    第四，精简了机构，充实了教学第一线。
