Tokyo, November 3 (New China News Agency) - Japanese revolutionary leftist friend Nagashima Matsuo recently published an article in the November issue of "Mao Zedong Thought Studies" denouncing the traitors of the Soviet people, Khrushchev and his successors, for destroying the world's first socialist state built by the great Lenin.

The article states that after Stalin's death, Khrushchev and his successors wantonly distorted Marxism-Leninism, concocting the fallacy that capitalist countries can peacefully transition to socialist countries, openly denying the Marxist-Leninist essence of violent revolution. This is the greatest betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

The article states that another essence of Marxism-Leninism is the dictatorship of the proletariat. This theory teaches us that without a strong dictatorship of the proletariat led by a revolutionary party, socialism cannot be maintained and built. However, the modern Soviet revisionists claim that the Soviet Union is transitioning from socialism to a communist society, so the Communist Party should develop from being the vanguard of the proletariat into the party of the entire Soviet people, and the Soviet state should become the state of the entire people.

The article states that the great leader Chairman Mao and the Chinese Communist Party armed with Mao Zedong Thought were the first and most sagacious in seeing through the ugly essence of Soviet modern revisionism. They creatively applied Marxism-Leninism to theoretically criticize Soviet modern revisionism.

The article states that the great Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, Mao Zedong Thought is praised as the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Now, to become a true Marxist-Leninist, one must study and practice Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, whether one supports and advocates for Mao Zedong Thought, whether one "reads Chairman Mao's books, listens to Chairman Mao's words, and acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions" has become the dividing line between Marxist-Leninists and revisionists.

The article exposes that the Soviet revisionist leadership is currently attempting to use the opportunity of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to plot a great conspiracy to betray the world's people. They plan to convene a black meeting of revisionist party leaders from various countries during this period, aiming to collude with American imperialism to oppose the Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries in the world with the Chinese Communist Party as the core. The article concludes with a call: Defend the strong bastion of world revolution and national liberation, the People's Republic of China! Long live the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution!

Stockholm, November 5 (New China News Agency) - The Swedish progressive magazine "Torch" in its recently published fifth issue published an article condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership's revisionist foreign policy of colluding with the United States against China and betraying the world's revolutionary people.

The article states: Soviet revisionists are implementing a revisionist foreign policy that is diametrically opposed to Chairman Mao's theory that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers.

The article states: Soviet revisionists collude with American imperialism and all reactionaries to oppose socialist China. Soviet revisionists collude with American imperialism to support all reactionaries worldwide to suppress revolutions and kill revolutionary people. Soviet revisionists have betrayed the world's revolutionary people and their interests. The article condemns the Soviet revisionist leadership's policy of fake support and true betrayal of the Vietnamese people for the common interests of the United States and the Soviet revisionists.

The article criticizes the Soviet revisionists' policy of betrayal in the Indonesian issue and then condemns the Soviet revisionists' assistance to the Indian reactionaries in attacking China. The article states: Regarding the Sino-Indian border issue, "facts show that India is the aggressor, while the Chinese have repeatedly sought a peaceful solution to the border issue." However, "the Soviet Union not only gives political support to the Indian reactionary leaders but also provides extensive economic and military aid."

The article continues, in the Middle East, the Soviet revisionist leadership collaborates with American imperialism to betray the Arab people and support Israeli aggression. The article believes that the Soviet revisionists are friends of the Arab people in words, but in actions, they are enemies of the Arab people.

    日本革命人士痛斥苏修对十月革命的大背叛
    称颂毛泽东思想是当代马列主义的顶峰
    瑞典进步杂志谴责苏修集团推行出卖世界革命人民的修正主义外交政策
    据新华社三日讯　东京消息：日本革命左派朋友长岛又男在最近出版的《毛泽东思想研究》十一月号上，撰写文章痛斥苏联人民的叛徒赫鲁晓夫及其继承人，葬送了由伟大的列宁缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家。
    文章说，斯大林逝世后，赫鲁晓夫及其继承人，肆意歪曲马克思列宁主义，炮制出资本主义国家可以和平过渡到社会主义国家的谬论，公然否认马克思列宁主义精华之一的暴力革命的理论。这是对马克思列宁主义的最大的背叛。
    文章说，马克思列宁主义的另一个精华是无产阶级专政。这个理论教导我们，没有革命政党领导下的坚强的无产阶级专政，就不能保持和建设社会主义。但是，苏联现代修正主义者却胡说什么，苏联正在从社会主义向共产主义社会过渡，所以共产党应当从作为无产阶级的先锋队发展成为苏联全民的党，苏联的国家也应当成为全民的国家。
    文章说，伟大的领袖毛主席和用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国共产党，最先最英明地看穿了苏联现代修正主义的丑恶的本质，他们创造性地运用了马克思列宁主义，对苏联现代修正主义从理论上进行了批判。
    文章说，伟大的毛主席把马克思列宁主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段，所以，毛泽东思想被称颂为当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。现在，要想成为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，就必须学习毛泽东思想并且身体力行。因此，是否支持和拥护毛泽东思想，是否“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事”就成为马克思列宁主义者和修正主义者的分水岭。
    文章揭露苏修领导集团，目前正企图利用纪念十月革命五十周年的机会，策划一个背叛世界人民的大阴谋。他们打算在这个时期纠集世界各国修正主义政党头目举行黑会，目的在于同美帝国主义相勾结，对抗以中国共产党为核心的世界各国马克思列宁主义政党。文章最后高呼：保卫世界革命和民族解放的坚强堡垒中华人民共和国！当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰毛泽东思想万岁！中国文化大革命万岁！十月社会主义革命五十周年万岁！
    据新华社斯德哥尔摩五日电　瑞典进步杂志《火炬》在最近出版的第五期上发表文章，谴责苏修领导集团联美反华、出卖世界革命人民的修正主义外交政策。
    文章说：苏联修正主义者推行着一条修正主义的外交政策，它是同毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎的学说相对立的。
    文章说：苏联修正主义者同美帝国主义和一切反动派相互勾结，反对社会主义中国。苏联修正主义者勾结美帝国主义支持全世界的反动派，来镇压革命，杀害革命人民。苏联修正主义者背叛了世界革命人民和他们的利益。文章谴责苏修领导集团为了美帝和苏修的共同利益对越南人民实行假支持、真出卖的政策。
    文章指责苏联修正主义者在印尼问题上的背叛政策后，接着谴责苏联修正主义者帮助印度反动派进攻中国。文章说：关于中印边界问题，“事实表明印度是侵略一方，而中国人则屡次寻求边界问题的和平解决”。但是，“苏联不仅给印度反动领导人以政治上的支持，而且还给予广泛的经济和军事援助”。
    文章接着说，在中东，苏修领导集团同美帝国主义合作出卖阿拉伯人民，支持以色列侵略。文章认为，苏修在口头上是阿拉伯人民的朋友，而他们在行动上却是阿拉伯人民的敌人。
