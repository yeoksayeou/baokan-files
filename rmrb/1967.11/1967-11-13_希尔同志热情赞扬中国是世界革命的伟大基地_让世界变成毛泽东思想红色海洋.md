Comrade Hill Warmly Praises China as a Great Base for World Revolution
Let the World Become a Red Sea of Mao Zedong Thought

	New China News Agency, November 12th

	Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) Chairman E.F. Hill and Comrade N. Gallagher, accompanied by Comrade Liu Ningyi, visited Beijing Normal University, which is in the midst of an educational revolution, and received a warm welcome from the revolutionary teachers and students.

	Comrade Hill delivered an impassioned speech to the welcoming revolutionary teachers and students. He said, "In the struggle to make Mao Zedong Thought the highest and absolute authority, we fight alongside you. We have joined you in the struggle to criticize China's Khrushchev."

	Comrade Hill said that today, both in China and around the world, there is a struggle between two lines. Wherever Mao Zedong Thought triumphs, wherever Mao Zedong's revolutionary line is implemented, the revolutionary initiative of the masses can be fully unleashed, and socialism can achieve brilliant victories.

	Comrade Hill said, "Socialist China, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, is a great base for world revolution. China has provided great support for the world revolution." He said, "Mao Zedong Thought provides brilliant guidance to all the people of the world. Let all the laboring people of the world grasp Mao Zedong Thought, turn the world into a red sea of Mao Zedong Thought, and submerge all imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries."

	The responsible comrades of the Beijing Normal University Revolutionary Committee and the Red Guards held a discussion with Comrade Hill and others. During the discussion, the responsible comrades of the Revolutionary Committee introduced the situation of the Cultural Revolution in their school and, on behalf of all the revolutionary teachers and students, presented a full-body plaster statue of Chairman Mao and a shining red Chairman Mao badge to Comrade Hill and others.

    希尔同志热情赞扬中国是世界革命的伟大基地
    让世界变成毛泽东思想红色海洋
    新华社十二日讯  澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席爱·弗·希尔同志和诺·加拉格尔同志，今天由刘宁一同志陪同，访问了处在教育革命高潮中的北京师范大学，受到革命师生热烈的夹道欢迎。
    希尔同志对欢迎的革命师生发表了热情洋溢的讲话。他说：“在使毛泽东思想取得最高的、绝对的权威的斗争中，我们同你们战斗在一起。我们同你们一起参加了批判中国赫鲁晓夫的斗争。”
    希尔同志说，今天，在中国和在全世界都进行着两条路线的斗争。凡是毛泽东思想取得胜利的地方，凡是执行毛主席革命路线的地方，人民群众的革命首创精神就能够得到发扬，社会主义就能取得辉煌的胜利。
    希尔同志说：“毛泽东思想指导下的社会主义中国是世界革命的伟大基地。中国对世界革命进行了大力的支援。”他说：“毛泽东思想给全世界人民以光辉灿烂的指导。让世界上所有的劳动人民都掌握毛泽东思想，变成毛泽东思想的红色海洋，淹没一切帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派。”
    北京师范大学革命委员会负责同志和红卫兵小将们同希尔等同志举行了座谈会。在座谈会上，革命委员会负责同志介绍了他们学校文化大革命的情况，并代表全校革命师生把毛主席的全身石膏塑像和红光闪闪的毛主席像章献给了希尔等同志。
