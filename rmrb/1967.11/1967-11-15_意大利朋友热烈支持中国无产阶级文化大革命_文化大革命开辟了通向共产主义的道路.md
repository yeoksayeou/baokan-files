Italian revolutionaries closely follow and support the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and support the struggle of the Chinese proletarian revolutionary forces and the revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong. We clearly understand that the victory of this great revolution is the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also our victory, the victory of all revolutionary people of the world. Long live the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!

These words, spoken by members of the Italian-China Cultural Friendship Association delegation during a radio broadcast in Beijing, express the sentiments of true Marxist-Leninists in Italy and represent the voice of the Italian revolutionary people.

Members of the Italian-China Cultural Friendship Association delegation hold deep affection for our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao, and have boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought. As soon as they stepped onto the red soil of China, upon arriving at the capital's airport, all members of the delegation enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years!"

During their visit to China, the delegation always carried the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them, and studied Chairman Mao's teachings diligently every day in conjunction with their visits. They deeply felt that the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sole guiding ideology for the people of the world to strive for liberation today. Before leaving China, the delegation leader, Enrico Lambardi, said, "Our visit to China has made us increasingly believe that today's China is the revolutionary base area of Yanan. Under the guidance of the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought—people of the world will certainly achieve victory over imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries."

The delegation members brought with them the enthusiastic support and expectations of the Italian revolutionary people for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. After arriving in China, they eagerly studied the experiences of the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and actively learned from the Chinese proletarian revolutionary forces. During their stay in Beijing, they wrote a big-character poster titled "Beat the Fallen Dog" overnight. In this revolutionary big-character poster, they stood shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese proletarian revolutionary forces, expressing their resolute support for the Chinese proletarian revolutionary forces in fighting against the top-ranking capitalist-roaders within the Party. They also vowed to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of rebellion and launch a counterattack against the Italian revisionists. Delegation member, Carmelo Fragomeni, in his radio broadcast, also fully expressed the sentiments of true Italian revolutionaries towards the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a unique experience in human history. It is a further development of Marxism-Leninism. The Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has solved the problem of consolidating power through revolutionary means under the dictatorship of the proletariat, preventing the danger of capitalist restoration.

Fragomeni said, the Chinese Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution marks a new stage in world history. This revolution has opened up the path to communism. Its experiences are not only the experiences of the Chinese people but also the experiences of the people of the world. It points out the path for the people of the world to thoroughly defeat imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

    意大利朋友热烈支持中国无产阶级文化大革命
    文化大革命开辟了通向共产主义的道路
      “意大利的真正革命者，怀着深厚的感情注视着中国的无产阶级文化大革命，支持中国无产阶级革命派的斗争，支持以毛泽东同志为代表的革命路线。我们清楚地知道，这场大革命的胜利是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，也是我们的胜利，是全世界革命人民的胜利。当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席万岁！万万岁！”不久前访问我国的意中文化友好关系协会访华代表团的同志们在北京一次广播讲话中的这些话，表达了意大利真正的马克思列宁主义者的感情，代表了意大利革命人民的声音。
    意中文化友好关系协会访华代表团的同志们对我们伟大领袖、世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席满怀热爱，对毛泽东思想无限崇拜。当他们来到中国红色的国土，刚刚踏上首都机场的时候，全团的同志就热情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万万岁！”
    代表团在中国参观访问期间，《毛主席语录》总是随身携带，每天结合参观访问认真学习毛主席的教导。他们深深体会到战无不胜的毛泽东思想是当代世界人民争取解放的唯一指导思想。代表团团长恩里克·拉姆巴尔蒂在离开中国前夕说：“在中国的访问，使我们越来越相信，今天世界上的中国，就是当年的革命根据地延安。在当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，世界人民一定能够取得反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的胜利。”
    代表团的同志们带来了意大利革命人民对中国无产阶级文化大革命的热烈支持和期望。代表团同志们来到中国后，热情地学习中国无产阶级文化大革命的经验，积极向中国无产阶级革命派学习。代表团在北京期间，曾连夜赶写了一张题为《痛打落水狗》的大字报。在这张革命的大字报中，他们同中国无产阶级革命派心连心，表示坚决支持中国无产阶级革命派斗批中国党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，并且要发扬革命造反精神，大造意大利修正主义者的反。代表团成员卡尔梅罗·弗拉戈梅尼在他的一篇广播讲话中，也充分表达了意大利真正的革命者对中国无产阶级文化大革命的感情。他说，中国无产阶级文化大革命是人类历史上独一无二的经验，它是对马克思列宁主义的进一步发展。中国无产阶级文化大革命解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下，用革命的方法巩固政权的问题，防止了资本主义复辟的危险。
    弗拉戈梅尼说，中国无产阶级文化大革命，标志着世界历史的崭新阶段，这场革命开辟了通向共产主义的大道。它的经验不仅是中国人民的，也是世界人民的经验，它向世界人民指出了彻底击溃帝、修、反所应遵循的道路。
