The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam's Executive Committee calls for the military and people to destroy more enemies this winter and next spring, fighting unyieldingly to the final victory. Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho writes to thank Chairman Ho Chi Minh for his support of the National Liberation Front's political program.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 2nd, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported that on October 22, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a call to arms, urging all the military and people of South Vietnam to advance bravely and achieve even greater victories this winter and next spring.

The call to arms, after reviewing the glorious victories achieved by the military and people of South Vietnam in the past two winters and springs, pointed out that the current situation on the battlefield in South Vietnam is: the military and people of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and more victorious with each battle; the enemy, the more troops they send, the more disastrous their defeats.

The call to arms said, we must still face many serious tests. But no matter how difficult and arduous the situation, our people will not yield, will not become slaves, and will fight to the final victory.

The call to arms urged the People's Liberation Armed Forces to fully display revolutionary heroism, to fiercely and broadly strike the enemy, to annihilate more of the enemy's fighting strength, and to smash all their plots; the people in enemy-occupied areas must resolutely oppose the enemy's conscription and forced labor, rise up to destroy "strategic hamlets" and "strategic wards," and strive for their own liberation; the people in liberated areas must strengthen their unity, hold their guns firmly, and be ready at any time to smash the enemy's "sweeps," while increasing production and actively supporting the front, vowing to be a strong rear support for the people in enemy-occupied areas.

The call to arms finally urged all the military and people of South Vietnam, under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, to bravely overcome all difficulties and achieve even greater victories this winter and next spring.

According to the New China News Agency in Hanoi on the 2nd, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho of the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam recently wrote letters to Chairman Ho Chi Minh and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, expressing their thanks for their congratulations and support for the political program of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The letters emphasized that the 14 million heroic people of South Vietnam are determined to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and lead the struggle against American imperialism to complete victory.

In his letter to Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho wrote: Chairman Ho's letter of congratulations on the political program of the National Liberation Front made the people of South Vietnam feel boundless joy and increased their confidence, making everyone more enthusiastic and determined to advance bravely, resolutely leading the struggle against American imperialism to complete victory.

The letter said: "The American aggressors and their lackeys, though stubborn and cunning, have recklessly escalated and expanded the war. However, bombs cannot intimidate our compatriots, and cunning arguments cannot deceive them. In recent days, they have again launched savage attacks on the heart of the nation—Hanoi, committing extremely barbaric crimes. The military and people of South Vietnam vow to fight to the death with the American aggressors and the traitorous Vietnamese puppets, determined to give them fivefold, tenfold heavy blows, avenging the people of the capital and the nation."

Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho's letter pointed out: "The military and people of South Vietnam are determined to advance, to thoroughly defeat more than a million American troops, puppet troops, and mercenary troops, to liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately achieve the peaceful reunification of the country."

The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam wrote in their letter to the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam: "American imperialism is our nation's most brutal and dangerous enemy. The National Liberation Front and the people of South Vietnam have no illusions about American imperialism and are determined to fight until they defeat its aggression."

The letter of thanks finally pointed out: "The 14 million people of the South, under the glorious banner of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, are determined to fight until there is not a single shadow of American aggressors on our beloved land."

    据新华社河内二日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团十月二十二日发表号召书，号召越南南方全体军民奋勇前进，在今冬明春夺取更加巨大的胜利。
    号召书在回顾了越南南方军民在过去的两个冬春季中所取得的辉煌胜利后指出，目前越南南方战场的形势是：越南南方军民越打越强，越打胜利越大；敌人越增兵，失败得就越惨。
    号召书说，我们还必须经受许多严重的考验。但不管多么艰难困苦，我们人民不屈不挠、誓死不做奴隶，坚决战斗到最后胜利。
    号召书号召人民解放武装力量高度发扬革命英雄主义精神，狠狠地、广泛地打击敌人，消灭敌人更多的有生力量，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋；敌占区人民要坚决反对敌人抓兵拉夫，奋起捣毁“战略村”和“战略坊”，争取自身解放；解放区人民要加强团结，紧握手中枪，随时准备粉碎敌人的“扫荡”，同时增加生产，积极支援前线，誓作敌占区人民的坚强后盾。
    号召书最后号召，越南南方全体军民，在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，英勇地战胜一切艰难困苦，在冬春季里夺取更为巨大的胜利。
    据新华社河内二日电　越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿和越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会最近分别写信给胡志明主席和越南民主共和国政府，感谢对越南南方民族解放阵线政治纲领的祝贺和支持。感谢信强调指出：一千四百万英雄的越南南方人民，决心彻底战胜美国强盗，把抗美救国事业引向彻底的胜利。

    信中说：“美国强盗及其走狗虽然顽固、狡猾，冒险地升级和扩大战争，但是，炸弹决不能吓倒我国同胞，狡诈的论调决不能欺骗我国同胞。最近几天，它们又连续地疯狂袭击全国的心脏——首都河内，犯下了无比野蛮的罪行。越南南方军民誓与美国侵略强盗和卖国越奸集团不共戴天，决心给它们以五倍、十倍的沉重打击，为首都和全国同胞报仇。”

    越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会在给越南民主共和国政府的信中写道：“美帝国主义是我们民族的最残暴和最危险的敌人。民族解放阵线和越南南方人民对美帝国主义不抱任何幻想，并决心战斗到打败它的侵略战争的时候为止。”
    感谢信最后指出：“一千四百万南方同胞在越南南方民族解放阵线的光荣旗帜下，决心战斗到在自己可爱的国土上没有一个美国侵略者的影子时为止。”
