Workers at the Jiangxi Boiler Factory, inspired by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, have designed and manufactured the province's first thousand-ton hydraulic press. Practical operation has proven that the machine's performance is excellent, and its quality fully meets the design requirements. The entire factory's revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses enthusiastically acclaim this as a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. The completion of this thousand-ton hydraulic press not only solves the factory's production problems but also creates favorable conditions for improving the plate material forming process throughout the province.
