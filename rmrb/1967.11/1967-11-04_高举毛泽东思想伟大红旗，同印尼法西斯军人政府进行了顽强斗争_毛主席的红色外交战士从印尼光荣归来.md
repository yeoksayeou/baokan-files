Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, our country's embassy and consulates in Indonesia have engaged in a prolonged and tenacious struggle against the Suharto-Nasution fascist military government. The red diplomats from Chairman Mao have returned to the motherland in glory.

On the afternoon of November 3, the entire staff of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in Indonesia, who have been fighting tenaciously against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government, returned to the capital of the motherland, back to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, carrying with them the fighting friendship of the Indonesian revolutionary people.

Central and Cultural Revolution Group leaders Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and Liu Ningyi, as well as soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, revolutionary masses of the capital, Red Guards, and overseas Chinese who had returned from Indonesia, totaling several thousand people, went to the airport to welcome the return of the red diplomats and to pay their highest respects to the proletarian cultural revolution.

Indonesian Communist Party Central Political Bureau member and head of the Indonesian Communist Party delegation Yusuf Ajitorop, and other Indonesian friends in Beijing, such as Cha Huaduo, Supeno, Isa, Willy, and Afif, as well as representatives of Indonesian students, also went to the airport to welcome the return of the red diplomats.

The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Huang Wenxing, and the twenty members of the embassy and consulates, in the struggle against the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian reactionary government, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carried forward the fighting spirit of the proletarian cultural revolution, fearlessly faced the enemy, and were not afraid of sacrifice. They demonstrated the spirit of the Chinese nation to fight to the death with their enemies. Their heroic deeds greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and struck a heavy blow to the arrogance of the American imperialists and their Indonesian reactionary lackeys. The people of the entire nation are proud and honored by the revolutionary integrity of the red diplomats, who are loyal to Chairman Mao and loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and their brave fighting spirit. They praise them as heroes of the great motherland and as red diplomats of Chairman Mao.

Today, the capital airport presented a revolutionary and fighting scene. The national flag of the great motherland fluttered in the wind. Giant banners hung on the tall buildings of the airport, reading: "Strongly protest the Indonesian reactionaries' sabotage of the two countries' relations!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the people of China and Indonesia!" The revolutionary masses of the capital, holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and the quotations from Chairman Mao, gathered at the capital airport, singing revolutionary songs and shouting fighting slogans, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, strongly protesting the current Indonesian government's severance of diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia, expressing resolute support for the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, and resolute support for the anti-persecution struggle of the broad patriotic overseas Chinese.

Around 3 PM, the plane carrying the red diplomats slowly landed. Immediately, the airport was filled with cheers. The revolutionary masses waved the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," continuously shouting: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" As the red diplomats stepped out of the plane, they held the portrait of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, raised the five-star red flag that once flew over the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, and excitedly shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" Huang Wenxing, Dai Yongbao, and Tang Songhe, who were injured by the Indonesian reactionary government, held the portrait of Chairman Mao and were carried off the plane on stretchers by medical personnel.

Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and Liu Ningyi, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," welcomed the returning comrades at the front of the plane and shook hands and embraced Huang Wenxing, Dai Yongbao, Tang Songhe, Shi Jinkang, Zhang Yu, Li Shichun, Yan Kangsheng, Wu Liangzhi, Yang Zhengguo, Yang Jifeng, Jia Nianchang, Zhang Guliang, He Huijun, Wang Dianjia, Hu Chaopin, Zhou Qinglong, Chen Jun, Guo Haoliang, Wei Qingliang, and Chen Jingpei, one by one, expressing their heartfelt greetings. The red diplomats, one by one, threw themselves into the arms of the central leaders, with tears in their eyes, repeatedly saying: "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Wish Chairman Mao eternal life!" Ajitorop and other Indonesian friends also shook hands and embraced each red diplomat, expressing their heartfelt greetings.

A team of Red Guards stepped forward, pinning the shining red Chairman Mao badges on the chests of the red diplomats and presenting them with the red revolutionary treasure "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

At this moment, thousands of people in the entire venue read aloud the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "This army has an indomitable spirit. It will trample down all enemies and never be subdued by them. No matter how difficult and dangerous the situation may be, as long as there is one person left, that person will continue to fight on."

"All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem powerful, but in reality, they have no real power. From a long-term perspective, the true strength does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Zhou Enlai, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and Liu Ningyi, along with the red diplomats, walked around the venue to meet with the welcoming crowd. At this time, the airport was filled with the sound of drums and slogans, with people continuously shouting: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "Down with Suharto! Down with Nasution!" "The collusion of American imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and Indonesian reactionaries to oppose China will have no good outcome!" "The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the people of China and Indonesia!"

The Indonesian friends who came to welcome the return, holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao and the quotations from Chairman Mao, holding banners reading "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Indonesian reactionaries!" "All those who oppose China and discriminate against Chinese people will have no good outcome!" sang the revolutionary song "Rebellion is Justified," welcoming the return of the red diplomats of our country. When our heroic sons and daughters came to their side, they waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," expressing their highest respect to the red diplomats. The revolutionary masses of the capital simultaneously shouted: "Resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people!" "The Indonesian people will win! The Indonesian reactionaries will be defeated!"

The staff of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in Indonesia who had previously returned to the motherland also went to the airport to welcome the return. The comrades-in-arms who had fought side by side reunited, shaking hands and embracing each other, celebrating the great victory of the people of the motherland in their struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and celebrating the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the motherland. To the tune of "The Ship of the Great Sea Navigates by the Helmsman," they, together with the welcoming crowd, repeatedly shouted: "Long live the victorious line of the proletarian revolution of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Down with the number one capitalist-roader in the Party!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!"

Today, those who went to the airport to welcome the red diplomats also included leaders from relevant government departments and the Beijing Revolutionary Committee. Among them were Wu De, Qi Pengfei, Qiao Guanhua, Han Nianlong, Xu Yixin, Hao Deqing, Li Qiang, Xie Huaiyi, and Chu Tuonan, as well as the relatives of the red diplomats in Beijing.

When the red diplomats left Kunming this morning, the leaders of the People's Liberation Army in Kunming, leaders from relevant departments, Red Guards, revolutionary masses, representatives of returned overseas Chinese, and Chinese experts and technicians who had returned to Kunming to aid Myanmar, as well as the Vietnamese Democratic Republic Consul General in Kunming, Yang Wenzhong, braved the rain to go to the airport to see them off.
