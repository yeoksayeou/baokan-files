The heroic military and civilian people of North Vietnam have, by November 6, shot down 2,500 U.S. aggressor aircraft and captured a large number of American air pirates in the more than three years since the start of the war. This is a shameful defeat for the so-called "air superiority" that U.S. imperialism has always boasted about, and a great victory for the spirit of decisive battle and victory of the military and civilian people of North Vietnam.

Since U.S. imperialism began bombing North Vietnam more than three years ago, despite continuously "escalating" and intensifying the bombing, the higher the escalation, the more miserable the fall. The U.S. air pirates cannot escape the net set by the military and civilian people of North Vietnam. From August 5, 1964, when U.S. aggressor aircraft attacked North Vietnam, to December 25, 1965, when U.S. imperialism began playing the "temporary halt to bombing" trick, the military and civilian people of North Vietnam shot down an average of 46 U.S. aircraft per month; from January 31, 1966, when Johnson ordered the resumption of bombing to June 29 of the same year, in the five months of resolute counterattacks against U.S. imperialism's new war "escalation," the military and civilian people of North Vietnam shot down nearly 60 enemy aircraft per month; from June 29, 1966, the U.S. air pirates brazenly bombed the capital of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and continuously bombed important cities such as Haiphong. The military and civilian people of North Vietnam struck back with fierce artillery fire, and by the end of May this year, they shot down an average of 75 enemy aircraft per month. Since June 5 this year, when the military and civilian people of North Vietnam shot down the 2,000th U.S. aggressor aircraft, they have even more fiercely struck the U.S. air pirates. In the past five months, the military and civilian people of North Vietnam have shot down a total of 500 U.S. aggressor aircraft, averaging 100 aircraft per month.

In the past five months, the military and civilian people of North Vietnam have fought bravely, not only shooting down many enemy aircraft during the day but also striking the U.S. air pirates at night, leaving them with no place to hide and suffering heavy losses; not only have the people's army units actively participated in the counterattacks against U.S. aircraft, but also the broad masses of militia, including many female and elderly militia members, have established many brilliant achievements, forming a people's war against the U.S. air pirates. In areas where U.S. aggressor aircraft frequently invade, they are also the places where they are shot down the most. To punish the U.S. aggressor aircraft for their crazy invasions, the heroic military and civilian people of Hanoi alone shot down 35 enemy aircraft in the five days from October 24 to 28. The military and civilian people of Haiphong shot down a total of 48 invading U.S. aggressor aircraft from August 31 to September 11. The military and civilian people of the Vinh Linh area near the demilitarized zone also fought brilliantly, shooting down three U.S. B-52 strategic bombers, known as the "most powerful," in two battles.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The ultimate source of the great power of war lies in the masses." "Weapons are an important factor in war, but not the decisive factor. The decisive factor is people, not things." The fact that the heroic 17 million military and civilian people of North Vietnam have achieved victory after victory in the anti-U.S. national salvation war once again eloquently proves the absolute correctness of Chairman Mao's above-mentioned profound judgment.

    越南军民决战决胜粉碎美帝“空中优势”
    取得击落美机两千五百架的辉煌胜利
    据新华社河内八日电　本社记者报道：英雄的越南北方军民在到十一月六日为止的三年多的时间里，已经击落了两千五百架美国强盗飞机，并且活捉了大批美国飞贼。这是美帝国主义一贯吹嘘的“空中优势”的可耻破产，是越南北方军民决战决胜精神的伟大胜利。
    美帝国主义自从三年多以前开始派飞机轰炸越南北方以来，尽管不断“升级”，步步加紧狂轰滥炸，但“升级”升得越高，就摔得越惨。美国空中强盗逃不脱越南北方军民布下的天罗地网。从一九六四年八月五日美国强盗飞机袭击越南北方起，到一九六五年十二月二十五日美帝国主义开始玩弄“暂停轰炸”骗局时止，越南北方军民平均每月击落美国飞机四十六架；从一九六六年一月三十一日约翰逊下令恢复轰炸到六月二十九日以前的五个月内，越南北方军民坚决反击美帝国主义新的战争“升级”，平均每月击落敌机将近六十架；从一九六六年六月二十九日起，美国强盗飞机悍然多次轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内，并且不断轰炸海防等重要城市，越南北方军民更以猛烈的炮火痛击美国空中强盗，到今年五月底止，平均每月击落敌机七十五架。从今年六月五日越南北方军民击落第两千架美国强盗飞机以来，他们更加狠狠地打击了美国空中强盗。越南北方军民在到十一月六日为止的五个月中，共击落美国强盗飞机五百架，平均每月击落一百架。
    在过去五个月中，越南北方军民英勇奋战，不仅白天击落许多敌机，同样在晚上也打得美国空中强盗无藏身之处，损失惨重；不仅人民军部队积极投入反击美机的战斗，而且广大民兵，其中包括许多女民兵和老民兵也建立了许多光辉战功，形成了抗击美国空中强盗的人民战争。在美国强盗飞机入侵活动频繁的地区，也是它们被打落最多的地方。为了惩罚美国强盗飞机疯狂侵袭，英雄的河内市军民单在十月二十四日到二十八日的五天中，就把三十五架敌机打得粉身碎骨。海防市军民在从八月三十一日到九月十一日，共打落四十八架入侵美国强盗飞机。靠近非军事区的永灵地区军民打得也很出色，他们在两次战斗中就打落三架号称“威力最大”的美国B—52战略轰炸机。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”英雄的一千七百万越南北方军民在抗美救国战争中取得节节胜利的事实，再一次雄辩地证明了毛主席上述英明论断的无比正确。
