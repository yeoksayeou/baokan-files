The first lesson is to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes

The ongoing educational revolution aims to completely overthrow the old educational system of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, which is a formidable political and ideological struggle. Naturally, it will encounter various obstacles. Our school's educational revolution has also been hindered by various non-proletarian thoughts. Some cadres and teachers, after experiencing a bit of the Cultural Revolution, are afraid to engage in ideological work again, only wanting to "struggle, criticize, and transform" or "struggle, criticize, and disperse." Some old cadres fear that if they lead the educational revolution poorly, they might return to the path of reformism and dare not lead the revolution. Some new cadres, lacking experience, become disheartened after a few setbacks. All these issues ultimately boil down to the word "self." This "self" has become a stumbling block for the educational revolution.

What should we do? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the entire Party to wage great political struggles." With the help of the Military-Political Training Team, we first established a Mao Zedong Thought study class in the Foreign Languages Department, focusing on the "Three Articles" and intensively transforming worldviews, achieving remarkable results. We promptly promoted the experience of the Foreign Languages Department and established Mao Zedong Thought study classes throughout the school.

After the Central Committee's notice on resuming classes and making revolution was issued, our school's Mao Zedong Thought study classes advanced further. The broad masses of teachers and students proposed to bring the study classes to the classrooms, making every corner of our school a battlefield for "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism," preparing the conditions for the educational revolution in terms of ideology and organization.

Mobilize the masses to wage a people's war

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and can be waged only by relying on them." The educational revolution must fully mobilize revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary workers to wage a people's war.

The masses are the true heroes. Once mobilized, they can solve any problem. Through several mass debates, our school has clarified the direction of the educational revolution, which must face the workers, peasants, and soldiers and the grassroots. We have also clarified the dialectical relationship between "struggling against self and criticizing revisionism" and the educational revolution, and resolved the issue of whether to resume classes and make revolution or to leave the school to make revolution. Currently, our school is conducting a major debate on the relationship between politics and business, thoroughly reforming departments, specialties, and the criticism of the old educational system. The deepening of this debate will greatly promote our school's educational revolution.

Starting from exposing and denouncing the revisionist educational line

Our great leader Mao Zedong says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism, is revolution. To destroy, one must reason, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it."

We believe that without thoroughly criticizing the revisionist educational line represented by China's Khrushchev, we cannot establish the proletarian educational line.

In criticizing the revisionist educational line, we have done the following:

First, we started by exposing and denouncing the revisionist educational line to arouse the class feelings and raise the class consciousness of the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

Each department in our school has exposed and denounced the revisionist educational system and line. Some workers' and peasants' children who have suffered deeply have used living facts to expose and denounce the persecution of the old educational system. Many young teachers and students who have been poisoned have also exposed and denounced the ideological corruption of the revisionist educational system through their personal experiences. At the same time, we invited old workers and poor peasants to join us in exposing and criticizing the revisionist educational line, further arousing the class feelings of the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

Second, we adopted the method of "five comparisons and one reform" to thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational system and line politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

The "five comparisons" are: how Chairman Mao taught us, how China's Khrushchev poisoned us, how the walk-capitalist roaders in our school acted, how the broad revolutionary teachers and students have fought against a handful of walk-capitalist roaders over the years, and how the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have carried out educational work. Based on the "five comparisons," we discussed reform plans. In this way, everyone not only understood what is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought and what is not, but also understood the direction and methods of reform.

Third, we combined learning, criticism, and investigation, practicing and reforming simultaneously.

Our school organized a small number of comrades, with specific issues in mind, to conduct investigations among workers, peasants, and soldiers. We distributed Chairman Mao's quotations on education to them and criticized the revisionist educational line together. We held investigation meetings among them and brought the results back to the school to further criticize the old educational system.

We also organized some comrades to systematically investigate the revisionist educational line that our school has implemented over the past decade and provided the results to the entire school for criticism.

Based on the criticism, the broad masses actively explored how to establish a socialist educational system and a new type of school, implementing criticism, teaching, and reform simultaneously.

We also organized some teachers and students to conduct investigations in primary and secondary schools to understand how a normal university should cooperate with primary and secondary schools to carry out the educational revolution. We also organized specialized personnel to help primary and secondary schools compile new textbooks. This method of teaching, practicing, and reforming simultaneously has been supported by the broad masses of teachers and students.

Fourth, we advocate the method of criticizing first and then reforming.

After the educational revolution, some departments and specialties in our school will definitely be abolished. However, reform must come after criticism. Without criticism, even if the surface appears to be reformed, the old educational ideas will definitely resurface at some point.

Fifth, we implemented the struggle, criticism, and reform courses.

After resuming classes and making revolution, it is easy to overlook large-scale criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform while focusing on resuming professional courses. Therefore, how to implement the struggle, criticism, and reform courses is an important issue. To solve this problem, we made the following decisions: regularly hold school-wide criticism meetings and adopt a combination of large, medium, and small-scale struggle meetings against a handful of walk-capitalist roaders and a few bourgeois academic "authorities" in our school to carry out planned struggles and criticisms.

Several issues must be addressed

We believe that the current resumption of classes and making revolution must address the following issues:

First, the relationship between resuming classes and making revolution. Resuming classes and making revolution must use revolution to lead the resumption of classes. Resuming classes primarily means studying Mao Zedong Thought well. Of course, some professional courses should also be studied. We must not forget the fundamental task of revolution and the fundamental task of studying Mao Zedong Thought just because we are resuming classes.

Mao Zedong Thought study classes should continue after resuming classes and should be promoted to the classrooms.

Second, the relationship between struggle, criticism, and reform. Without struggle and criticism, reform cannot be achieved. Especially when the masses have been mobilized, we should first guide the masses to struggle and criticize, not to start with reform. Destroy first, then construct, and construct within destruction.

Third, the relationship between reforming the fundamental system and reforming a single course. We believe that the educational revolution should focus on reforming the fundamental system. In terms of educational reform, the direction must be clear. Currently, some comrades are very interested in the future of their own specialty and the setting of a particular course but pay less attention to the reform of the old educational system. In fact, without reforming the fundamental system, the reform of a single course cannot be successful.

Fourth, the relationship between teachers and students. Teachers are the key to the educational revolution, and students are the main force. A new type of relationship should be established between teachers and students, with mutual help, mutual learning, and mutual promotion. Teachers should go to the classrooms and blend in with the students. We advocate teacher-student cooperation and joint lesson preparation.

Fifth, the relationship between leaving the school to make revolution and resuming classes to make revolution. Resuming classes to make revolution is the main focus. Conducting educational investigations should also focus on the situation of our own school. At the same time, we can organize a small number of people, with leadership, planning, and purpose, to conduct investigations or pilot projects to provide materials and create experiences for the educational revolution.

    毛泽东思想照亮了教育革命的道路
    华东师范大学革命委员会
    第一课是大办毛泽东思想学习班
    目前正在开展的教育革命，要彻底推翻封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的旧教育制度，是一场很艰巨的政治斗争和思想斗争，必然会遇到各种各样的阻力。我校的教育革命，也受到了各种非无产阶级思想的阻碍。有些干部和教师在文化大革命中“喝了几口水”，便害怕再搞意识形态的工作，只想“斗批走”，“斗批散”；有的老干部怕搞不好又走上改良主义道路，不敢领导教育革命；有的新干部因为没有经验，受几次挫折，就心灰意懒。凡此种种，归根结底都是一个“私”字。这个“私”字成了教育革命的拦路虎。
    怎么办呢？毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”在军政训练团的帮助下，我们首先在外语系办了毛泽东思想学习班，大学“老三篇”，狠抓世界观的改造，成绩显著。我们及时地推广了外语系的经验，在全校普遍开办毛泽东思想学习班。
    中央关于复课闹革命的通知下达后，我校毛泽东思想学习班更加向前推进了一步。广大师生提出要把毛泽东思想学习班办到班级里去，使我校的每一个角落都能成为“斗私，批修”的战场，为教育革命在思想上和组织上准备了条件。
    放手发动群众，打一场人民战争
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”教育革命必须充分发动革命学生、革命教师、革命干部、革命工人，打一场人民战争。
    群众是真正的英雄，群众发动起来了，就没有解决不了的问题。我们学校通过几次群众性的大辩论，明确认识到教育革命必须面向工农兵、面向基层这一方向性问题，弄清了“斗私，批修”和教育革命的辩证关系，解决了复课闹革命还是出校闹革命的问题。目前，我校正在进行政治和业务的关系，彻底改革系、专业和对旧教育制度的批判的关系的大辩论。这场辩论的深入开展，必将大大地推动我校的教育革命。
    从揭发控诉修正主义教育路线入手
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”
    我们认为，不彻底批判以中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的修正主义教育路线，就不能大立无产阶级教育路线。
    在开展对于修正主义教育路线的批判中，我们做了这样的一些工作：
    第一，从揭发控诉修正主义教育路线入手，激发广大革命师生的阶级感情，提高阶级觉悟。
    我校各系都开展了对修正主义教育制度和教育路线的控诉。一些深受迫害的工农子弟以活生生的事实，揭发控诉了旧教育制度对他们的迫害。很多受毒害的青年教师和学生，也以切身的体会，揭发和控诉了修正主义教育制度对他们思想上的腐蚀。同时，我们还请老工人、老贫农同我们一起揭发批判修正主义教育路线，从而进一步激发了广大革命师生的阶级感情。
    第二，采取“五对照”“一改革”的方法，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判修正主义教育制度和教育路线。
    “五对照”即是：毛主席是怎样教导我们的，中国的赫鲁晓夫是怎样放毒的，本校的走资派是怎样干的，广大革命师生多年来是怎样与一小撮走资派进行斗争的，广大工农兵是怎样开展教育工作的。在“五对照”的基础上，讨论改革方案。这样，大家不仅明白了什么是符合毛泽东思想的，什么是不符合毛泽东思想的，同时也明白了改革的方向和途径。
    第三，学习、批判、调查相结合，边实践，边改革。
    我校有领导、有计划、有目的地组织了少量的同志，带着问题，深入到工农兵中去进行调查，把毛主席有关教育思想的语录发给工农兵，和他们一起批判修正主义教育路线。在他们中间开调查会，把调查的结果带回学校来，结合学校的情况再对旧教育制度进行批判。
    我们也组织了一些同志，对本校十几年来所贯彻的修正主义教育路线进行系统的调查，把调查结果提供全校师生进行批判。
    在批判的基础上，广大群众积极探索如何建立社会主义教育制度、新型学校的途径，实行边批判，边教学，边改革。
    我们还组织了部分师生深入到中、小学，调查中、小学教育情况，以弄清师范大学究竟应该如何配合中、小学开展教育革命。并且组织专门人员，帮助中、小学编写新的教材。这种边教学、边实践、边改革的方法，得到了广大师生的拥护。
    第四，提倡先批判后改革的方法。
    通过教育革命以后，我们有些系科，有些专业是肯定要取消的。但是，要改革必须先批判。不批判，即使表面上改革了，旧的教育思想到一定时候肯定会死灰复燃。
    第五，落实斗批改课。
    复课闹革命了，容易产生一种倾向，即是注意了复专业课，而忽视了大批判和斗批改。因此，如何落实斗批改课是一个重要问题。为了解决这个问题，我们作了如下决定：定期召开全校性的批判大会，同时采取对本校一小撮走资派和少数资产阶级反动学术“权威”实行大中小型斗争会相结合的方法，进行有计划的批斗。
    必须处理好几个问题
    我们认为，当前复课闹革命必须处理好下面几个问题：
    第一，复课和闹革命的关系。复课闹革命，一定要用革命统帅复课。复课，首要的是学好毛泽东思想。当然，也要学一些专业课。不能因为复课就把革命的根本任务忘掉了，把学习毛泽东思想的根本任务忘掉了。
    毛泽东思想学习班，在复课以后，仍然要坚持办下去，而且要提倡办到班级里去。
    第二，斗、批和改的关系。不进行斗、批，改就不可能实现。特别是在群众已发动起来的情况下，我们首先就应当引导群众去进行斗、批，不能首先着手于改。先破后立，在破中立。
    第三，根本制度的改革和一门课程的改革的关系。我们认为，教育革命应该着眼于根本制度的改革。在教改的问题上，方向一定要明。目前，有些同志对自己专业的前途和某一门课程的设置很感兴趣，而对旧教育制度的改革不很注意。实际上，根本制度没有改革好，一门课的改革是搞不好的。
    第四，教师和学生的关系。教师是教育革命的关键，学生是主力。师生之间应该建立新型的关系，要互相帮助，互相学习，互相促进。教师要下到班级里去，和学生打成一片。提倡师生结合，共同备课。
    第五，出校闹革命和复课闹革命的关系。复课闹革命是主要的。搞教育调查，也应着重调查本校的情况。同时，我们也可以有领导、有计划、有目的地组织少量人员，搞调查或试点，为教育革命提供材料，创造经验。
