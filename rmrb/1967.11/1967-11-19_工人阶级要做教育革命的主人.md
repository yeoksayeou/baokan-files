Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad masses of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, those who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." We workers heard this latest directive and were so moved that tears welled up in our eyes. We enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The old educational system, old teaching policies and methods must be thoroughly reformed. The revisionist educational line pushed by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev, cannot cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. In our institute, some newly enrolled workers and peasants initially found this revisionist line unacceptable, but by the second year, they began to feel indifferent, by the third year, they started to admire it, and by the fourth year, they were completely assimilated. Such a university is actually a big dye vat of the bourgeoisie, a place to cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie.

We love the Party the most, love Chairman Mao the most, and are most concerned about whether the proletarian cause in our country will have successors. We have long been firmly opposed to the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools.

Chairman Mao put forward: "Our educational policy must enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." Under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, our institute openly proposed to cultivate "aeronautical engineers," actually cultivating spiritual aristocrats who are superior to others. Some students, influenced by revisionist education, look down on workers. They go to factories for internships to gain some capital for fame and fortune, completely failing to integrate with workers, let alone transform their thinking. In their eyes, workers are merely their nannies for learning operational skills. We workers have no say in teaching, and the teaching syllabus is something we have no right to discuss.

In 1958, our great leader Chairman Mao put forward the policy of serving proletarian politics through education and combining education with productive labor. The revolutionary teachers and students in our institute carried forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to do, achieving great results. Many teachers and students, as ordinary laborers, came to the factory to work and live with us, establishing deep class feelings. They were tempered and improved. This fully proves that Chairman Mao's educational line is correct, and intellectuals can only be cultivated into true successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause by integrating with workers and peasants and combining with productive labor. However, due to China's Khrushchev's vigorous promotion of the revisionist educational line, this magnificent educational revolution was strangled.

At the decisive stage of victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao issued the battle cry for educational revolution. We, the working class, must act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, start from a thorough criticism, and thoroughly smash the old and unreasonable educational system. We must turn the factory into a classroom for class struggle, a place for students to integrate with workers and for theory to integrate with practice. We must smash the big dye vat of the bourgeoisie, turn the school into a smelting furnace of the proletariat, cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and ensure that our iron-clad country will never change color.

    工人阶级要做教育革命的主人
    北京航空学院八八一厂工人　俞振新
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”我们工人听到这一最新指示，一个个激动得热泪盈眶，热烈欢呼“毛主席万岁！”
    旧的教育制度，旧的教学方针和方法，必须彻底改革。以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的修正主义教育路线，根本不能培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人。我院有些新入学的工农学生，开始对修正主义这一套看不惯，但到第二年就感到无所谓，第三年就开始羡慕这一套，第四年就完全融合了。这样的高等学校，实际上是资产阶级的大染缸，是培养资产阶级接班人的场所。
    我们最热爱党，最热爱毛主席，最关心我国的无产阶级江山是否后继有人的问题。对资产阶级知识分子统治学校的现象，我们早就进行了坚决的抵制。
    毛主席提出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”我院在一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，公开提出把学生培养成为“航空工程师”，实际上是培养高人一等的精神贵族。有些同学受了修正主义的教育的影响，看不起工人。他们到工厂实习，是为了捞一点成名成家的资本，根本不与工人相结合，更谈不上改造思想，在他们眼里，工人只是他们学习操作技术的保姆。我们工人在教学中没有一点点主动权，教学大纲工人根本无权过问。
    一九五八年，我们伟大领袖毛主席提出教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，我院革命师生发扬了敢想、敢干的革命精神，作出了成绩。很多教师、学生，以普通劳动者的身份，来到工厂同我们一起劳动，一起生活，同我们建立了深厚的阶级感情。他们受到了锻炼，得到了提高。这充分说明毛主席的教育路线是正确的，知识分子只有与工农相结合，同生产劳动相结合，才能培养成为真正的无产阶级革命事业的接班人。但是，由于中国赫鲁晓夫极力推行修正主义教育路线，就把这场轰轰烈烈的教育革命扼杀了。
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的阶段，毛主席又发出了教育革命的战斗号令。我们工人阶级，一定要按毛主席的指示去做，发扬彻底革命的精神，从大批判着手，大破旧的不合理的教育制度。我们要把工厂作为阶级斗争的课堂，作为学生与工人相结合、理论与实践相结合的场所。我们要砸烂资产阶级的大染缸，把学校变成无产阶级的熔炉，培养和造就无产阶级革命事业的接班人，保证我国铁打的江山永不变色。
