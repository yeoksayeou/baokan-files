In the unprecedented triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in the days of national jubilation celebrating the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation, the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe's performance of "Revolutionary Acrobatics" has met with the broad masses of revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers in the capital in a brand-new guise!

The reason this revolutionary acrobatics performance is new lies in the fact that it is revolutionary. It uses the acrobatic art form that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers love to see and hear to express revolutionary combat content. The entire performance, with revolutionary enthusiasm and a fighting style, sweeps away the "performing," "changing," "training," and so-called "pure technique" performances that propagate feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism from the old acrobatics stage. Workers, peasants, and Red Guards have become the masters of the acrobatics stage. This is the preliminary result of the struggle, criticism, and transformation of acrobatics art under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. It is another victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the present-day world, all culture or literature and art belong to a definite class and are geared to a definite political line." Should acrobatics art serve proletarian politics? Can acrobatics art reflect the reality of the struggle? This is the focal point of the struggle between the two lines in the acrobatics world. The creation and performance of this revolutionary acrobatics by the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe have forcefully refuted the fallacy that acrobatics art is too technical to reflect the reality of the struggle. The counter-revolutionary revisionists Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, and their mastermind, China's Khrushchev, have always shouted about how "seeing a play can provide rest and make people happy, which is very good." They have also shouted about how "entertainment and rest encourage socialist enthusiasm." The capitalist-roaders in the acrobatics world have also talked nonsense about how "the purpose of acrobatics is to provide enjoyment and make people happy." They have even shouted at the top of their lungs that "revolutionizing acrobatics will lose the characteristics of acrobatics" and that "revolutionary performances are 'forgetting the ancestors of acrobatics,'" and so on.

The blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has sent this small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists to their graves, and their plots have been thoroughly foiled. The creation and performance of this revolutionary acrobatics have proven that acrobatics can indeed reflect our magnificent and colorful combat life, and in terms of artistic form, it can also develop the characteristics of acrobatics, making acrobatics art a powerful weapon for "uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy."

From the more than ten items in this performance, the most prominent feature is that they can closely combine with the current situation of the struggle. The comprehensive item "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Line" begins with the majestic music of "The East Is Red." The rising sun, with sunflowers made of flower trays all facing the red sun, symbolizes the millions of red hearts turning to our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, expressing the deep affection of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people for Chairman Mao. Following this, the performers use various acrobatic forms to present the eight model operas, including the Beijing opera "The Red Lantern," the symphony "Shajiabang," and the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," to enthusiastically praise Jiang Qing's adherence to Chairman Mao's proletarian literary and artistic line and her personally cultivated revolutionary literary and artistic models. "Red Brush" takes the great criticism as its theme, using bricklaying and balancing techniques to depict the lively scene of seven hundred million people all becoming critics and setting up criticism columns.

Another prominent feature of this performance is that it reflects Chairman Mao's great military thought of people's war. For example, the items "All the People Are Soldiers" depicting the practice of underground warfare, "Guerrilla Squad Behind Enemy Lines" depicting guerrilla fighters raiding Japanese fortresses and armories at night to seize weapons and arm themselves, and "Capturing the American Imperialist Wolf" praising the heroic image of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army's wisdom and bravery and exposing the ugly face of the American imperialist paper tiger, all from different angles and using various acrobatic techniques and diverse performance forms, vividly and vividly depict the immense power of people's war that is invincible in a hundred battles, and enthusiastically praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

The third prominent feature of this set of programs is that the revolutionary political content and the acrobatic art form have achieved a relatively good unity. From the items in this performance, it can be seen that the basic skills and many individual techniques of acrobatics are not that they cannot be used, but that they are not enough. It can be said that the new content puts forward higher requirements for acrobatic techniques. For example, the somersaults and combat actions used in the item "Guerrilla Squad Behind Enemy Lines" are mainly used to show the performer's skills on the old acrobatics stage. If a somersault is not done well, it can be repeated and practiced again, even three or five times. However, in the specific environment of "Guerrilla Squad Behind Enemy Lines," when the guerrilla fighters are bravely fighting against the Japanese, this somersault can only be done well once; otherwise, it will destroy the entire theme and damage the image of the guerrilla fighters as heroes. Again, the item "All the People Are Soldiers" is basically performed using techniques such as crawling through hoops, combat, and somersaults. However, to fully express the broad revolutionary masses' enthusiastic response to Chairman Mao's great call to prepare for war and implement the policy of all the people being soldiers, it is necessary to have a strong class sentiment and break the old framework of individual technique performances, combining with other techniques to complete this task. This shows that relying solely on the existing acrobatic techniques to reflect the new life of socialist revolution and socialist construction today is far from enough. Of course, to create socialist new acrobatics, it is more important to deeply integrate with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, refine from revolutionary practice, and learn from sibling arts, thereby creating and enriching the means of acrobatic expression.

Although the items in this performance by the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe are still relatively rough and the variety is not rich enough, and there are some problems that need to be further studied and solved, it has taken a step forward on the road of revolutionizing acrobatics art, and the direction is correct. We hope that the comrades of the Chinese Acrobatic Troupe will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, carry forward the spirit of thorough revolution, seriously carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation, further purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic black line in the acrobatics world, and long-term and unconditionally integrate with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, combine with workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly transform their worldview, and strive to create more and better revolutionary acrobatics items!

    杂技艺术的新生面
    中央直属文艺系统戏剧口批判组
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中，在庆祝建国十八周年举国欢腾的日子里，中国杂技团排演的《革命杂技》，以崭新的姿态同首都广大工农兵革命群众见面了！
    这场革命杂技之所以新，就新在它是革命的。它以广大工农兵群众听喜闻乐见的杂技艺术形式，表现了革命战斗的内容。整个演出以革命的豪情和战斗的风格，一扫旧杂技舞台上宣扬封、资、修的“耍”、“变”、“练”和所谓
  “纯技术”的表演，工农兵和红卫兵小将成了杂技舞台的主人。这是杂技艺术在毛泽东思想照耀下进行斗批改的初步战果，这是毛主席革命文艺路线的又一胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“在现在世界上，一切文化或文学艺术都是属于一定的阶级，属于一定的政治路线的。”杂技艺术要不要为无产阶级政治服务？杂技艺术能不能反映现实斗争？这是杂技界两条道路斗争的焦点。中国杂技团这场革命杂技的创作和演出，有力地驳斥了所谓杂技艺术技术性强不能反映现实斗争的谬论。反革命修正主义分子陆定一、周扬之流，以及他们的总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫，一贯叫嚷什么“看了戏，能得到休息，使人高兴，就很好。”什么“搞娱乐，休息，就鼓励了社会主义积极性了。”杂技界的党内走资本主义道路的当权派也胡说什么：“杂技的目的就是供人欣赏，使人愉快。”“内容无害，能起娱乐作用，就是有益的东西，对杂技来说这是重要的方面，甚至是主要的方面。”他们极力阻止杂技革命化，甚至声嘶力竭地叫嚷：杂技革命化就会失去杂技的特点，搞革命化的节目是“忘记了杂技的祖宗”，等等。
    无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子送进了坟墓，他们的阴谋彻底破产了。这次革命杂技的创作和演出证明：杂技完全能够反映我们壮丽多彩的战斗生活，而且在艺术形式上还能够发展杂技的特点，使杂技艺术也成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人”的有力武器。
    从这次演出的十几个节目来看，最突出的一个特点是能够密切配合当前的斗争形势。《毛主席革命文艺路线胜利万岁》这个综合性的节目，是在气势磅礴的《东方红》乐曲声中开始的。旭日东升，用花盘组成的朵朵葵花朝着红太阳，象征着千万颗红心向着最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，抒发了亿万革命人民无限热爱毛主席的深厚感情。接着，演员们运用不同的杂技形式，把京剧《红灯记》、交响音乐《沙家浜》、芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》等八个样板戏，一一展现在观众面前，热情洋溢地歌颂了江青同志遵循毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，亲手培植的革命文艺样板。《红画笔》以大批判为主题，运用砌砖及晃梯踢碗的技术，描绘了七亿人民都做批判家，大搞批判栏的生动情景。
    这次演出另一个突出的特点是表现了毛主席人民战争的伟大军事思想。例如表现地道战演习的《全民皆兵》，表现游击队员夜袭日寇碉堡、武器库，夺取武器武装自己的《敌后武工队》，以及歌颂南越解放军智勇双全的英雄形象，揭露美帝纸老虎的丑恶嘴脸的《活捉美帝野心狼》等等节目，都从不同的角度，应用不同的杂技技巧和多种多样的表演形式，形象地、生动地表现了人民战争百战百胜的巨大威力，热情地歌颂了战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    这场节目的第三个特点是，革命的政治内容与杂技的艺术形式得到了较好的统一。从这次演出的节目来看，杂技的基本功和许多单项技巧不是用不上而是不够用了。可以说新的内容对杂技的技巧提出了更高的要求。例如《敌后武工队》这个节目所运用的翻腾、格斗的动作，在旧的杂技舞台上主要是看演员练功夫，一个斤斗没有翻好，可以重复再练一次，甚至三五次，可是在《敌后武工队》这个特定的环境里，当武工队员与日寇进行英勇战斗时，这个斤斗就只能一次翻好，不然就破坏了整个主题，破坏了武工队员的英雄形象。又如《全民昏兵》这个节目，基本上是用钻地圈、格斗、翻腾等技巧，但是要充分表现广大革命群众热烈响应毛主席关于备战的伟大号召，实行全民皆兵的主题，就必须带着强烈的阶级感情，打破单项技巧表演的旧框框，结合其他技巧才能完成这一任务。这说明只靠现有的杂技技巧来反映今天社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新生活，是非常不够的。当然，要创造社会主义的新杂技，更重要的是必须深入工农兵群众，从革命的实践加以提炼，并向兄弟艺术借鉴，从而创造和丰富杂技的表现手段。
    这次中国杂技团的演出，尽管节目还比较粗糙，品种还不够丰富，有些问题尚待进一步研究解决，但是，它在杂技艺术革命化的道路上迈进了一步，方向是对头的。希望中国杂技团的同志，遵照毛主席的教导，发扬彻底的革命精神，认真地进行斗、批、改，进一步肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线在杂技界的流毒，长期地无条件地深入到工农兵群众中去，与工农兵相结合，彻底改造世界观，为创作更多更好的革命杂技节目而奋斗！
