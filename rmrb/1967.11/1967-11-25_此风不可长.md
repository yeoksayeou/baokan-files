Recently, in Wuhan, some units and revolutionary mass organizations, in celebration of the establishment of revolutionary committees and other organizational structures, have exhibited tendencies towards extravagance, ostentation, and wastefulness.

Before the establishment of a revolutionary committee, one school, in order to showcase its "grandeur," sent telegrams to all four directions and dispatched invitations everywhere. A unit with over a hundred people, to celebrate the establishment of its revolutionary committee, rented a large theater capable of seating two thousand people, ordered two thousand or more commemorative badges, and invited nearly two hundred units as guests. The expenditure alone amounted to several hundred yuan. Adding to this the costs of the entire preparation process and the reciprocal formalities of the invited units, the total amount would be even greater. What is more serious is that when the masses pointed out that such practices do not conform to the spirit of frugality for revolution, the relevant personnel did not pay any attention.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is even longer, the work even greater, and the struggle even more arduous. This must be made clear to the Party now, and comrades must be made to continue to maintain a style of modesty, prudence, and not being arrogant or impatient, and must be made to continue to maintain a style of hard struggle."

I believe that the extravagant and wasteful practices of these units, squandering the resources of the state and the people, completely go against Chairman Mao's teachings and must be firmly opposed and resolutely stopped.

专栏：革命群众来信

    此风不可长
    最近，武汉有些单位和革命群众组织，为了庆祝革命委员会等组织机构成立，出现了讲排场，摆阔气，铺张浪费的现象。
    有一个学校在成立革委会之前，为了炫耀自己的“气派”，四方拍电报，到处寄请帖。有个一百多人的单位，为了庆祝革委会成立，租了一个能坐二千人的大剧场，定制了两千几百套纪念章，邀请了近两百个单位的客人，花费就达几百元，再加上整个筹备过程中的开支和被邀请单位的礼仪，等等，累计起来，数字就更多了。更严重的是，当群众提出这样做不符合节约闹革命的精神时，并没有引起有关人员的重视。
    毛主席教导我们：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。这一点现在就必须向党内讲明白，务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”我认为，这些单位慷国家和人民之慨的铺张浪费作风，完全违背了毛主席的教导，必须坚决反对，坚决制止。
