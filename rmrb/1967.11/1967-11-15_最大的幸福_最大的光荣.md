	The Greatest Happiness and the Greatest Glory
	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! I solemnly swear to you: I will spend my life reading your books, listening to your words, following your instructions, being your good soldier, and following you in revolution.

	Beijing Military Region Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works Liu Tiangé

	Dearest Chairman Mao! Since I enlisted, I have always thought of you, day and night, yearning for you. On the thirteenth, I finally saw you. This is the greatest happiness and the greatest glory of my life. You are waving and walking towards us! My heart is pounding with excitement, and tears of happiness are streaming down. I couldn't care less about wiping them away or moving, all I wanted was to look at you more.

	Dearest Leader Chairman Mao! It is your sunshine and rain that nurtured me, a cowherd from a wealthy family, into a proletarian revolutionary soldier who knows how to serve the people; it is your boundless great thoughts that have given me endless fighting strength! In the 1950 battle to liberate Zhongding Island, when the ship was hit and the rudder was broken in a critical moment, I remembered your great call to "carry the revolution through to the end." I was fearless, braving the enemy's fierce artillery fire, and together with my comrades, we repaired and crossed the sea, securing the first boat in the sea battle.

	As my position changed, I once showed signs of becoming detached from the masses. I remembered your teaching, "All our work comrades, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." I fought against my selfishness, recalled my bitterness to prevent change, maintained the character of an ordinary soldier, and strengthened my ties with the masses.

	Dearest Chairman Mao! Your health is so good, this is the greatest happiness for revolutionary soldiers and all revolutionary people in China and the world. Your energy is so abundant, giving the greatest confidence and strength to the people of the whole country and the world.

	Dearest Chairman Mao! You are the reddest sun in our hearts, the most outstanding leader of the contemporary proletariat, the greatest genius of our time. Your brilliant thoughts are the great banner of our era, the lighthouse for oppressed nations and peoples seeking liberation. With you and your brilliant thoughts, the Chinese revolution will surely be victorious, the world revolution will surely succeed, and communism will surely be realized throughout the world. Upholding your absolute authority and that of your thoughts is a great historical mission bestowed upon us by this great era, and it is also the lifelong battle task of revolutionary soldiers. Whoever opposes your supreme leadership is our sworn enemy, and we will resolutely defeat them, making sure they never rise again.

	Dearest Chairman Mao! Your great thoughts are the soul of our revolutionary lives, the strength of our battles, the direction of our progress, and the foundation of our revolution. I have spent the first half of my life following your teachings step by step. In the second half of my life, I will redouble my efforts to study and apply your works, using your brilliant thoughts to guide every second of my life, and using your brilliant thoughts to direct every nerve in my body. Great Commander Mao! I solemnly swear to you: I will spend my life reading your books, listening to your words, following your instructions, being your good soldier, and following you in revolution.

    最大的幸福　最大的光荣
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我庄严地向您宣誓：一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事，一辈子做您的好战士，一辈子紧跟您干革命。
    北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子　刘天革
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！我打参军起，一直想念您，日日盼，夜夜想，十三日终于见到了您。这是我一生最大的幸福，最大的光荣。您挥手向我们走过来啦！我激动的心儿蹦蹦跳，幸福的泪水哗哗流。我顾不上擦啊，顾不上动，一个心眼想多看看您。
    最最敬爱的领袖毛主席啊！是您的阳光雨露把我这个财主家的放牛娃哺育成为一个懂得为人民服务的无产阶级革命战士；是您光焰无际的伟大思想给我增添了无穷的战斗力量！在一九五○年解放零丁岛的战斗中，当船被打漏、船舵被打断的紧急关头，我想起您“将革命进行到底”的伟大号召，浑身是胆，冒着敌人猛烈的炮火，和战友们一起，边抢修边强渡，争得了渡海作战第一船。
    随着职务的变化，我曾经一度有脱离群众的苗头。我记起了您“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”的教导，狠斗私心，忆苦防变，保持普通一兵的本色，密切了同群众的联系。
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您的身体这样健康，这是我们革命战士和全中国全世界革命人民最大的幸福。您的精力这样充沛，给了全国人民和全世界人民最大的信心和力量。
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，您是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，您是当代最伟大的天才。您的光辉思想是我们时代的伟大旗帜，是被压迫民族、被压迫人民求解放的灯塔。有了您，有了您的光辉思想，中国革命就一定会胜利，世界革命就一定会成功，共产主义就一定能在全世界实现。大树特树您和您的思想的绝对权威，是伟大时代赋予我们的历史使命，也是我们革命战士终生的战斗任务。谁反对您的最高领袖地位，谁就是我们不共戴天的敌人，我们就要坚决把他打倒，叫他永世不得翻身。
    最最敬爱的毛主席啊！您的伟大思想是我们革命战士生命的灵魂，战斗的力量，前进的方向，革命的根本。我前半辈子就是按照您的教导一步一步地走过来的。我后半辈子更要加倍努力活学活用您的著作，要用您的光辉思想统帅我生命的每一秒钟，用您的光辉思想指挥我每一根神经。伟大统帅毛主席！我庄严地向您宣誓：一辈子读您的书，一辈子听您的话，一辈子照您的指示办事，一辈子做您的好战士，一辈子紧跟您干革命。
