Young Woman Shkuta Dies Heroically While Building the Railway; Her Father Turns Grief into Strength and Takes Over Her Work

NEW DELHI, Nov. 10 (Xinhua) — The great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, wrote a letter on Nov. 9 to Parllak Vata, the father of Shkuta Vata, a 15-year-old girl who died a heroic death while working on the Logjcën-Fieri railway. In his letter, Comrade Hoxha praised the father and daughter for their patriotism, their love for the Party and the people, and their revolutionary heroism.

The letter said: "Although Shkuta was only 15 years old, she was great, mature, and wise. Her actions were decisive. As a daughter of a patriotic family and a daughter of the steadfast and unyielding Albanian highlanders who stand firm in the face of storms and tempests, she set a high example of boundless love for her country, the Party, and her people with her heroic deeds. Her actions will inspire the heroic youth and all the working people of Albania to work and struggle for socialism, to overcome all difficulties and obstacles with unshakable determination, and to overcome the backward customs and religious rules that discriminate against women. Therefore, everyone will always remember her and respect her deeply."

The letter praised Parllak Vata for putting the interests of the whole above those of his family, for suppressing his grief at the loss of his beloved daughter, and for deciding to go to the railway construction site with his niece to take over Shkuta's work. The letter said: "This is another high example of patriotism and socialism, another great action of love for the country and loyalty to the Party, the people, and the country. It further carries forward the patriotic traditions of the Vata family."

The letter said: "The Party is proud to have such sons and daughters among the Albanian people. In the struggle and labor, they fear no difficulties, and with courage, wisdom, loyalty, sublime sacrifice, and heroism, they implement the Party's brilliant teachings with amazing firmness."

Parllak Vata is a member of a cooperative in the mountainous area of Skrapar District, Albania. Before liberation, under the savage rule of domestic and foreign enemies, the ancestors and parents of Vata suffered untold torments and hardships, and many of them sacrificed their lives in the struggle. After liberation, the Albanian Labor Party brought light and happiness to the Vata family.

Not long ago, his 15-year-old daughter Shkuta responded to the call of the Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha, actively opposed backward customs, and together with more than 140 other young women, went to the Logjcën-Fieri railway construction site to participate in voluntary labor, and died a heroic death on the construction site.

After learning of the sad news of his daughter's death, Parllak Vata wrote a letter to the beloved leader Enver Hoxha, expressing his determination to carry on Shkuta's cause and go to the railway construction site with his niece to participate in voluntary labor.

    女青年什库塔为修铁路光荣牺牲  父亲化悲痛为力量接替女儿工作
    霍查同志写信赞扬人民的革命英雄主义
    新华社地拉那十日电　阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的伟大领袖霍查同志，九日写信给在洛格齐恩—费里铁路工地劳动时光荣牺牲的十五岁女青年什库塔·瓦塔的父亲帕尔·瓦塔，赞扬他们父女热爱祖国、热爱党和人民的革命英雄主义。
    信中说，尽管什库塔刚满十五岁，但她是伟大的、成熟的、聪明的，她的行动是坚决的。什库塔作为一个爱国志士家庭的当之无愧的女儿，作为在急风暴雨面前巍然屹立和坚贞不屈的阿尔巴尼亚高山山民的女儿，她以自己英勇的行动，树立了对祖国、党和自己的人民无限热爱的崇高榜样。她的行动将鼓舞阿尔巴尼亚英雄的青年和全体劳动人民如何去为社会主义而工作和斗争，如何毫不动摇地战胜一切困难和障碍，战胜歧视妇女的落后习俗和宗教族规。因此，大家将永远怀念她，深深地尊敬她。
    信中赞扬帕尔·瓦塔把整体利益置于家庭利益之上，抑止住失去爱女的悲痛，并决定同侄女一起到铁路工地接替什库塔的工作。信中说，这是又一个爱国主义和社会主义的崇高榜样，是热爱祖国和忠于党、忠于人民和祖国的又一个伟大行动，这更进一步发扬了瓦塔一家的爱国主义传统。
    信中说，党感到骄傲的是在阿尔巴尼亚人民中有这样的儿女。他们在斗争和劳动中，不怕任何困难，以勇敢、智慧、忠诚、崇高的牺牲精神和英雄主义，以惊人的坚定性贯彻党的光辉学说。
    帕尔·瓦塔是阿尔巴尼亚斯库台区一个山区的合作社社员。解放前，在国内外敌人的野蛮统治下，瓦塔的祖辈和父辈受尽了折磨和苦难，不少人在斗争中牺牲。解放以后，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党给瓦塔的家庭带来了光明和幸福。
    不久以前，他的十五岁的女儿什库塔响应党和霍查同志的号召，积极反对落后习俗，并同一百四十多名女青年一起，来到洛格齐恩—费里铁路工地，参加义务劳动，光荣牺牲在工地上。
    帕尔·瓦塔在获悉女儿牺牲的沉痛消息后，写信给敬爱的领袖霍查，表示坚决继续什库塔的事业，同他的侄女一起前往铁路工地，参加义务劳动。
