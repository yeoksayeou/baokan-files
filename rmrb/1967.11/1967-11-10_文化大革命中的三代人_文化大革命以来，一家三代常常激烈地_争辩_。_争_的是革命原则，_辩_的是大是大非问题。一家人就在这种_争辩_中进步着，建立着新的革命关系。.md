Since the Cultural Revolution, three generations of a family often engage in heated "debates." The "debate" revolves around revolutionary principles and major right and wrong issues. The family progresses and establishes new revolutionary relationships through these "debates."

Grandma Gao's daughter, Zhang Shuching, works in the packaging department of a pharmaceutical factory in Beijing. Her granddaughter works in the injection department, and her grandson-in-law is a tablet technician. Previously, these three generations of family members, aside from some differing opinions on trivial family matters, had always been harmonious. However, since the Cultural Revolution, the three generations often engage in heated "debates." They do not "debate" over family disputes but rather over revolutionary principles and major right and wrong issues. As Zhang Shuching said, "This is a reflection of the struggle between the two lines in our family." The family progresses and establishes new revolutionary relationships through these "debates."

The "Red Rebel" organization in the factory was the first to rise up against the capitalist roaders within the party. Zhang Shuching firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." She resolutely joined the "Red Rebels."

Her daughter, Yulan, and son-in-law, however, held different views and joined an organization opposed to the "Red Rebels." The members of this organization were revolutionary, but they were once deceived by the capitalist roaders. Zhang Shuching fought against the capitalist roaders in the factory and engaged in reasoned debates with this organization. At home, she reported and explained the situation to her elderly mother and engaged in debates with her daughter and son-in-law. Sometimes, these debates lasted half the night, and they even forgot to eat.

Grandma Gao watched and listened to the intense debates between the two generations. She felt that her daughter Shuching was right and that her path was correct. Once, she heard Shuching say how the capitalist roaders in the factory viciously opposed Mao Zedong Thought and how they suppressed workers from studying Chairman Mao's works. The more she listened, the angrier she became, wishing she could join her daughter in the struggle. She told Shuching, "If there is no one outside to support you, I will support you!"

Shuching patiently educated her daughter Yulan, propagating Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously exposing the capitalist roaders' plots, and fighting against the "selfish" thoughts in Yulan's mind. Finally, Yulan awakened and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, her son-in-law had not yet awakened, and Shuching persisted in working on him. Once, her son-in-law did something wrong and knew it was wrong, so he quietly returned home early and went to bed. Zhang Shuching would not let such a principle error pass. As soon as she returned home, she called her son-in-law out of bed and seriously asked him, "Don't you think about what path you are taking? How can you face Chairman Mao? If we don't rise up to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, who will? Rely on China's Khrushchev? Not only will workers be exploited again, but the country will change color. How can you not see this?" Zhang Shuching saw that her daughter was not bold enough to uphold the truth in this matter and severely criticized Yulan, pointing out that if she did not quickly discard her petty-bourgeois sentimentalism, she would harm both herself and others.

Throughout the intense struggle, Grandma Gao always stood with Shuching, sympathizing with her and supporting her.

Through repeated struggles, the daughter and son-in-law clarified right from wrong and raised their consciousness. After the entire factory united, the whole family enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, actively participated in criticizing and repudiating revisionism, and paid more attention to state affairs, continuously advancing in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    文化大革命中的三代人
    文化大革命以来，一家三代常常激烈地“争辩”。“争”的是革命原则，“辩”的是大是大非问题。一家人就在这种“争辩”中进步着，建立着新的革命关系。
    高老太太的女儿张淑清在北京制药厂服务车间当包装工人，外孙女是针剂车间工人，外孙女婿是片剂技术员。以前，这三代亲人，除了家庭琐事有点不同意见外，一直是和和气气。但是，文化大革命以来，三代人常常激烈地“争辩”起来。他们
  “争辩”的不是什么家事纠纷，“争”的是革命原则，“辩”的是大是大非问题。象张淑清说的：“这是两条路线斗争在我们家里的反映。”一家人就在这种“争辩”中进步着，建立着新的革命关系。
    厂里的“红色造反者”组织，最早起来造了厂里党内走资派的反。张淑清牢记毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，毅然决然地参加了“红造”。
    她的女儿玉兰和女婿同她的观点可大不相同，参加了与“红色造反者”对立的组织。这个组织的群众是要革命的，但一度受了走资派的蒙蔽。张淑清在厂里同走资派斗争，同这个组织展开说理辩论；回到家就把斗争情况向老母亲宣传、讲解，并同女儿女婿开展辩论。有时一辩论就是半宿，甚至连饭也忘记吃了。
    两代人激烈的辩论，高老太太都看在眼里，记在心上。她觉得女儿淑清讲得有理，路走得对。有一次，她听淑清说，厂里走资派如何恶毒地反对毛泽东思想，如何压制工人学习毛主席著作，越听越气，恨不得和女儿一起去斗争。她向淑清表示：“外面要没有人支持你，我支持你！”
    淑清耐心地教育女儿玉兰，向玉兰宣传毛主席的革命路线，不断揭发走资派的阴谋，同女儿玉兰头脑里的“私”字作斗争，终于使女儿醒悟过来，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。可是，她女婿一时还不觉悟，淑清同样坚持对他做工作。有一次，她女婿做了一件错事，自己知道做得不对头，就悄悄提前回到家里睡下了。张淑清对这种原则错误决不放过，一回到家就把女婿从床上叫起来，严肃地问他：“你也不想想，你走的是什么路？那点对得起毛主席？咱们不起来保卫毛主席的革命路线，还靠谁？靠中国的赫鲁晓夫吗？那别说工人要重受剥削，国家也要变颜色，你怎么就看不清？”张淑清见女儿在这件事情上没有大胆坚持真理，又严肃地批评了玉兰，指出她如不赶快扔掉小资产阶级温情主义，就会害人害己。
    在激烈的斗争中，高老太太始终同淑清站在一起，同情她，支持她。
    经过反复的斗争，女儿女婿分清了是非，提高了觉悟。全厂大联合之后，他们全家又热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极参加斗私，批修，更加关心国家大事，在无产阶级文化大革命中不断前进。
