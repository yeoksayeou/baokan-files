The sunlit grassland

A red sun rose from the east. The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Grassland Middle School, facing the morning sun, joyfully entered the classroom. Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, they began a new day of teaching and learning.

The first sounds from the classrooms were no longer "Stand up, salute, sit down," but the passionate and loud voices of the revolutionary teachers and students: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Building a New Type of Teacher-Student Relationship

In the first-year second class, a Chinese language lesson was in progress, focusing on reviewing and explaining Chairman Mao's poem "Changsha: Snow."

The entire class was mainly led by the students. After each student finished explaining a section, the teacher would offer their opinions, quote relevant passages from Chairman Mao's works, and summarize briefly. Finally, they would connect the poem to the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, explaining the poem's brilliant practical significance.

The teacher, Li Yandong, was hesitant to stand on the podium to teach. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, students had criticized her, and she felt her authority was undermined. She thought, "If students criticize their teacher, my authority is gone. How can I teach anymore?" She decided to change careers.

In early March, the school began military and political training. Although she reluctantly participated with the students, her heart was elsewhere. Later, through class education and rectification studies, she gradually changed her mind. She thought, "Chairman Mao wants us to serve the people completely and thoroughly, but I was thinking about myself. How can I serve the people if I feel wronged by a little criticism? With such selfish thoughts, even if I change careers, I still won't be able to serve the people well." She decided to stay at the school.

As the resumption of classes and the revolution began, Li Yandong's thoughts fluctuated again. She feared she wouldn't teach well, feared making mistakes, feared students being disobedient, and feared students asking difficult questions. The military comrades in charge of the training, knowing her situation, used Chairman Mao's teachings on the masses to educate her. They encouraged her to replace "fear" with "dare" and "self" with "public," to boldly step onto the podium. They suggested she turn her first class into a personal struggle meeting.

Li Yandong entered the classroom with a try-it-out attitude. In that class, she taught "In Memory of Norman Bethune." She didn't teach the text word by word as before, but compared Bethune's spirit of a true communist with her own selfish thoughts, exposing them to the students. She praised many good deeds among the students and expressed her desire to learn from the Red Guards. As she taught, the students listened quietly, even the most mischievous ones were silent. After class, some students tightly held her hand, saying, "Teacher Li, we didn't understand you before, and some of our words were too harsh. It's all our fault. In the future, we will learn from you and carry out self-revolution!"

This class deeply moved Li Yandong. She said with deep emotion: The key to establishing a new type of teacher-student relationship is to first overcome selfishness.

Only with Mao Zedong Thought Can There Be Authority

The path Li Yandong took is the path most teachers in this school have taken. Because they dared to break the feudal "authority of the teacher" and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, the teacher-student relationship quickly changed qualitatively.

Take political teacher Wang Hongguang, for example. Before and after the resumption of classes and the revolution, he went to the students six times, each time facing resistance. With the help of the military comrades, he repeatedly used Mao Zedong Thought to examine himself, finally gaining the students' trust and speaking rights on the podium. However, he did not expect the "authority of the teacher" to resurface in daily life. Once, Wang Hongguang helped a student arrange seats, and the student disagreed with his opinion, arguing with him. This hurt Wang Hongguang's "pride." He thought, "How can I be a teacher?" So, he insisted the student follow his opinion.

Wang Hongguang returned to his dormitory, calmed down a bit, and felt he had done something wrong. He learned from the military comrades and consulted Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's teachings made Wang Hongguang realize that he had started from the teacher's personal "authority," using coercion on the students. Even if the students followed his opinion, it was still based on the old "authority of the teacher," not on the new type of teacher-student relationship based on Mao Zedong Thought, which is the socialist new type of teacher-student relationship.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought made Wang Hongguang brave. In another class, he laid out his thought struggle process in detail. The students were delighted. The student who had argued with him found him after class to talk face-to-face. Teacher and student exchanged hearts, and the more they talked, the closer they became. This incident educated both the teacher and the students. They said: The socialist new type of teacher-student relationship is based on Mao Zedong Thought. Teachers can only have authority if they master Mao Zedong Thought. The more Mao Zedong Thought a teacher has, the more the students will respect them.

Correctly and Comprehensively Viewing Teachers

When the resumption of classes and the revolution began, some teachers were hesitant and did not dare to go to class to teach. The students of the third-year first class saw this and discussed it among themselves. They felt that if the teachers did not dare to teach boldly, it was not only because of their own thoughts but also because of the students. Many students, although they knew most teachers were good or relatively good, still had difficulties when faced with specific people and specific issues. They always felt it was not ideal. Some students, from a petty-bourgeois standpoint, viewed teachers who had participated in their own organizations favorably and those who had participated in other organizations unfavorably. Where was the root of the problem? With the help of the military comrades, the students recalled the situation at the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. At that time, the old Beijing Municipal Committee sent a work team to the school. Soon after the work team arrived, they vigorously promoted the bourgeois reactionary line of "doubt everything, overthrow everything," saying, "All teachers are small fortresses and must be attacked." Among the students, they incited one group against another, stirring up the masses to fight each other. The poison of the bourgeois reactionary line created by Liu Shaoqi had been criticized during the military and political training, but its remnants still lingered in the minds of many. Everyone agreed to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, and to correctly and comprehensively view teachers.

The students of the third-year second class, to welcome the teachers to resume classes and carry out the revolution, specially wrote a passionate letter, beating drums and gongs to deliver it to the teachers. At that time, the teachers were having a meeting to discuss how to resume classes and carry out the revolution. The students' revolutionary enthusiasm inspired every teacher's heart. They voluntarily stopped the meeting and followed the students to class. In the classroom, teachers and students sat together and talked heart to heart. Some criticized the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line, and some fiercely struggled against their own selfish thoughts. Teachers and students with serious opposing emotions, through self-criticism, shook hands and made up on the spot. Some students, with tears in their eyes, threw themselves into the teachers' arms, saying, "Teacher, it's all my fault." The teacher said, "It's not your fault, it's my misunderstanding of the revolutionary youngsters." Everyone concluded: The bourgeois reactionary line separated the revolutionary teachers and students, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line brought everyone together again.

To establish a socialist new type of teacher-student relationship, the teachers and students of this school, with the help of the military comrades, had extensive discussions. Based on the military's principle of "respecting cadres and loving soldiers" and combining the school's specific situation, the students formulated the "Eight Points of Respecting Teachers," and the teachers formulated the "Eight Points of Loving Students," together known as the "Double Eight Points of Respecting Teachers and Loving Students." After discussions, supplements, and modifications by all revolutionary teachers and students, these double eight points have become a common code of conduct for everyone.

    阳光照亮了草场地
    一轮红日，从东方升起。北京市草场地中学的革命师生，迎着朝阳，愉快地走进教室。他们，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，开始了新的一天的教学生活。
    从教室里首先传来的，再也不是“起立，敬礼，坐下”，而是革命师生热情宏亮的声音：“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    建立新型的师生关系
    一年级二班正在上语文课，内容是复习和讲解毛主席的诗词《沁园春·长沙》。
    全堂课主要由同学讲解。同学们每讲完一节后，老师就提出自己的意见，引用毛主席的有关语录，作出简短的小结，最后联系无产阶级文化大革命的一些情况，说明毛主席诗词的光辉的现实意义。
    任课的老师，叫李燕冬。她敢于上台讲课，是经过一番思想斗争的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，同学们给她提了一些意见，她面子上有些受不了。心想：学生给老师提意见，这一下威信全完了，以后还怎么教书？那时，她拿定主意要改行。
    三月初，学校开始军政训练。她虽然勉强和同学一起学习，一起操练，但身在一起，心各一方。以后，通过阶级教育、整风学习，她才慢慢地扭过弯来。心想：毛主席要我们“完全”“彻底”为人民服务，而自己却在为个人打算，受点批评就感到委屈，那怎么能行呢？抱着这种私心，就是改了行，也不能很好地为人民服务。“在哪里跌倒，就在哪里爬起来！”她开始下决心在这个学校呆下来。
    复课闹革命就要开始了。李燕冬的思想又波动起来。她一怕讲不好，二怕讲错了，三怕学生不听话，四怕学生出难题。负责军训的解放军同志知道这一情况后，就用毛主席有关的群众观点向她进行教育，鼓励她把“怕”字换上“敢”字，把“私”字换上“公”字，大胆走上讲台，并建议她把第一课变成自己斗私的讲用会。
    李燕冬带着试试看的心情步入教室。那一课，她讲的是《纪念白求恩》。她没有象过去那样，按照课文一字一句地讲解，而是对照白求恩同志的真正共产主义者的精神，把自己的私心向同学“亮”了出来，并表扬了同学中间的许多好人好事，表示要虚心向红卫兵小将学习。老师讲着，同学们静静地听着，连她认为最调皮的学生，也一声不吭。下课时，有些同学紧紧拉住她的手说：“李老师，过去我们不了解你，有些话说过了头，都怪我们不是。今后，一定要向你学习，象你那样破私立公，自我革命！”
    这一课，使李燕冬受到了极大的教育。她深有感触地说：新型师生关系的建立，关键是首先要斗“私”。
    有了毛泽东思想才有威信
    李燕冬所走过的道路，就是这个学校大多数老师所走过的道路。由于他们敢于大破封建主义的“师道尊严”，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，师生关系很快起了质的变化。
    就拿政治教师王洪光来说吧，他在复课闹革命前后，曾六次到同学中间去，每次都碰了钉子。在解放军同志的帮助下，他不断用毛泽东思想来检查自己，最后才得到同学的信任，在讲台上有了发言权。可是，他没有料到“师道尊严”的思想，在日常的生活中又冒了出来。一次，王洪光帮助同学排座位，有一个学生不同意他的意见，顶了他几句。这一下，可伤了王洪光的“尊严”。他想：我这个老师还怎么当？于是，就硬要学生按照自己的意见办。
    王洪光回到宿舍，稍微平静了一下，就觉得刚才做得有些不对头。他学着解放军的办法，向毛主席著作请教。毛主席的教导，使王洪光认识到，自己从老师的个人“威信”出发，对学生采取了压服的办法，这样做，即使学生照自己的意见办了，但仍是建立在旧的“师道尊严”上的师生关系，而不是建立在毛泽东思想基础上的师生关系，即社会主义的新型的师生关系。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，使王洪光变得勇敢了。他在上另一节课时，把自己的思想斗争过程，原原本本地摆了出来。同学们听了，打心眼里高兴。和王洪光顶过嘴的那个同学，课后又找他当面谈，师生进一步交了心，大家越谈越亲。这件事，教育了老师，也教育了学生。他们说：社会主义的新型的师生关系，就是建立在毛泽东思想基础上的师生关系。老师只有掌握了毛泽东思想才有威信，老师多一分毛泽东思想，学生就多尊重你一分。
      正确地全面地看待老师
    复课闹革命开始时，一部分教师顾虑较多，迟迟不敢下班讲课。三年级一班的学生看到这种情况，就坐在一起议论起来。他们觉得老师不敢大胆上课，固然自己思想有毛病，但和学生也有很大关系。不少同学虽说也知道大多数老师是好的和比较好的，但一碰到具体人、具体事，就想不通，总觉得不理想。少数同学从小资产阶级的派性出发，对参加过自己战斗组织的老师，看着什么都好；对参加过另一派组织的老师，看着什么都不顺眼。根子在那里呢？同学们在解放军同志的帮助下，回忆起无产阶级文化大革命初期的情况。那时，旧北京市委派了一个工作组到学校来。工作组进校不久，就大力兜售“怀疑一切，打倒一切”的资产阶级反动路线的货色，说“所有教师都是小碉堡，都要攻一攻”。在同学中间，他们拉一派，打一派，挑动群众斗群众。对中国赫鲁晓夫所炮制的资产阶级反动路线，在军政训练期间曾进行过批判，但它的流毒在不少人的头脑中还没有肃清。大家一致表示，要活学活用毛主席著作，狠批资产阶级反动路线，正确地、全面地看待老师。
    三年级二班的同学，为了欢迎老师下班复课闹革命，专门写了一封热情洋溢的信，敲锣打鼓送给老师。当时，教师正在一起开会，研究如何复课闹革命的问题。同学们的革命热情，激励着每个教师的心。他们自动停止了会议，跟着学生一起下班。在教室里，师生促膝谈心。有的控诉资产阶级反动路线的毒害，有的狠斗自己的私心杂念。一些对立情绪严重的师生，通过自我批评，当场握手言好。有的学生含着眼泪，扑到老师的怀里，说：“老师，都怪我不好。”老师说：“不怪你，是我对革命小将的看法不对。”大伙的结论是：资产阶级反动路线把革命师生分开，毛主席的革命路线又把大家团结在一起了。
    为了建立社会主义的新型的师生关系，这个学校的师生，在解放军同志的帮助下，经过充分的讨论，根据解放军“尊干爱兵”的原则，结合学校具体情况，学生们制订了“尊师八条”，教师们也制订了“爱生八条”，合称为“尊师爱生双八条”。经过全校革命师生讨论、补充、修改，这双八条已成为大家共同遵守的准则。
