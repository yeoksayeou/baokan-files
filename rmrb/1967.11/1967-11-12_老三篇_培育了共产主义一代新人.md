	The "Three Articles" have cultivated a generation of communists

	Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: Rio de Janeiro News: The "Mao Zedong Chairman's Works Study Group" in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, recently published a Portuguese version of the preface to the three brilliant works of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong: "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." In the preface, Mao Zedong Thought is highly praised, and the revolutionary people of Brazil are enthusiastically called upon to study Mao Zedong Thought. The preface points out: "The Three Articles" are the basic compulsory courses for revolutionaries and the motto for establishing a communist worldview, and are powerful ideological weapons for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness and for transforming the soul.

	The preface states: "These three articles teach us to dedicate ourselves wholeheartedly to the cause of people's liberation, to work selflessly for the people, and to cultivate a spirit of not caring about personal gains and losses, and of completely serving the people. They teach us to have the spirit of uniting the masses, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for final victory. Therefore, we will learn from these three articles to be responsible to the people, to fear no criticism, to dare to uphold the truth, and to correct our mistakes. They also teach us, according to the principles of proletarian internationalism, to regard the liberation cause of the oppressed peoples and nations of all countries in the world as our own cause."

	The preface points out: "Over the past twenty-plus years, the powerful ideology of these three articles has had an immeasurable impact on transforming people's spiritual outlook, cultivating a generation of communists, and promoting the people's revolutionary cause."

	The preface quotes Chairman Mao's sayings: "The transformation of world outlook is a fundamental transformation..." "In the process of building a socialist society, everyone needs to be transformed..." etc. The preface goes on to point out: "The establishment of a proletarian world outlook cannot be done in isolation; it requires the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. These three articles provide the most powerful and effective ideological weapons for eliminating selfishness and establishing public-mindedness and for transforming the soul."

	The preface concludes by quoting the words of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao: "'The Three Articles' are the easiest to read, but it is not easy to truly practice them. We should study 'The Three Articles' as a motto."
