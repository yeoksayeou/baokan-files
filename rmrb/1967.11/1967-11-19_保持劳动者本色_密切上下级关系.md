The revolutionary masses' leaders of Shanghai Fourth Dyeing and Finishing Factory, after participating in the leadership work of the factory's revolutionary committee, have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, resolutely opposed the bureaucratic style of the bourgeoisie, frequently gone among the masses, and consulted with the masses on all matters. This has greatly strengthened the relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses, creating a political atmosphere within the factory that is both serious and tense, as well as united and lively. The revolution and production in the factory have taken on a new look.

	Jump Out of the Circle of Affairs and Go Among the Masses

After the establishment of the revolutionary committee, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations participating in the committee were busy with administrative affairs all day, studying Chairman Mao's works less, and rarely visiting the workshops. The masses began to have more complaints about them. The propaganda team from a certain air force unit stationed in the factory discovered this problem and promptly pointed out to them: Now your status has changed, you must correctly handle the relations between cadres and the masses and between superiors and subordinates; otherwise, you will go astray and become detached from the masses. The leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations participating in the committee took this issue to heart and seriously studied Chairman Mao's works, as well as the ten regulations on ideological revolutionization by the revolutionary committee of Shandong Province and the editorial comments in the Red Flag magazine.

Chairman Mao said: "Communist Party members must never detach themselves from the masses, must never stand above the masses, act like officials, or lord it over the people. Instead, they should appear before the masses as ordinary laborers, go deep among the masses, and blend in with them." This instruction from Chairman Mao gave them great education. They recalled that during this movement, some cadres of worker origin, due to changes in their status and not listening carefully to Chairman Mao's words, had long been detached from the masses and eventually committed serious errors. Today, we are in power, our status has changed, and we must maintain close ties with the masses and forever preserve the character of the working people; otherwise, we will also degenerate and slip onto the path of revisionism.

On the basis of heightened awareness, they formulated five measures for the revolutionization of their factory's revolutionary committee. Thirteen committee members, with the exception of a few, did not leave their production posts but went to various workshops to work and study with the workers. Full-time staff members also worked twice a week. They resolutely carried out this regulation, actively participated in labor, were not afraid of dirt or hard work, and went wherever the conditions were toughest to fight alongside the masses, earning the praise of the masses.

	Humbly Listen to Different Opinions

In the past, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in the factory did not listen to opposing views, especially those from people who had opposed them.

In the early days of the factory's revolutionary committee, they brought this bad style into the committee. However, the propaganda team from the People's Liberation Army stationed in the factory brought a different style. They warmly welcomed the masses' opinions, actively sought out those who had raised issues to talk with them, and went deep into the workshops to solve problems. As a result, they transformed the most backward group in the entire factory into the most advanced group in studying Chairman Mao's works. The exemplary actions of the PLA comrades educated the leaders of the factory's revolutionary committee. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's works in light of their own thoughts and recognized that not being able to listen to different opinions was a manifestation of selfishness. They decided to improve this in their work. Once, when the chairman of the factory's revolutionary committee was handling a conflict between workers and half-work, half-study students, he said in anger, "Don't be so fierce, our revolutionary committee has its limits to tolerance." Some masses heard this and criticized him, saying, "You want to use the authority of the revolutionary committee to suppress people, do you want to settle accounts later?" That evening, at the study session of the factory's revolutionary committee, everyone discussed this incident based on Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. What bad things do we have that we are reluctant to give up?" Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone realized that although this was a slip of the tongue, it reflected a bureaucratic attitude of superiority, which must be taken seriously and not allowed to grow.

During the factory-wide campaign of revolutionary criticism, some masses sharply criticized, saying: "You leaders only talk about revolutionary criticism but do not mobilize the masses." The members of the factory's revolutionary committee listened to these opinions, reviewed their previous work, and felt that they had indeed not placed revolutionary criticism in the primary position, had not taken the lead, and had not fully mobilized the masses. Therefore, they immediately went deep into the workshops to lead the campaign of revolutionary criticism and also invited those who had previously had opinions about them to participate in the revolutionary criticism work. In this way, they greatly advanced the revolutionary criticism throughout the factory.

	Concentrate and Persist

Through several months of struggle and tempering, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in the factory's revolutionary committee deeply felt that "the masses are the real heroes" and "the people, and only the people, are the motive force in the creation of world history." This is an absolute truth. Every time the factory's revolutionary committee makes a decision, it first consults with the masses, goes among the masses to solicit opinions, and then concentrates them before implementing them among the masses.

Recently, the leaders of the revolutionary mass organizations in the factory seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadre issues and conducted a class analysis of the original party committee secretary of the factory, believing that although he had made serious mistakes, it was not a matter of enemy versus us, and he should be released. However, would the masses agree to this? The comrades of the factory's revolutionary committee decided to first hold separate meetings with old and new workers and cadres to solicit opinions from the masses. Based on Chairman Mao's teachings of "not only looking at a cadre's one-time or one-event performance, but also at the cadre's entire history and entire work," the masses conducted a comprehensive class analysis of the original party committee secretary of the factory. They not only believed that this cadre should be released but also criticized the leaders of the factory's revolutionary mass organizations for not promptly doing ideological work on the cadres. After the factory's revolutionary committee concentrated the opinions of the masses, they made a decision to release the original party committee secretary of the factory.

Because the members of this factory's revolutionary committee could seriously act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, correctly handle the relations between superiors and subordinates, actively contact the masses, and blend in with them, the masses trusted them more, cherished them, and supported them. The masses would speak out when they had opinions and would offer good suggestions. The entire factory was united, with close relations between superiors and subordinates, and both the revolution and production presented a new look.

    保持劳动者本色　密切上下级关系
    上海第四漂染厂新干部遇事和群众商量，参加生产劳动，深受群众拥护厂内形成了既严肃紧张又团结活泼的局面，革命和生产出现了崭新面貌
    新华社上海十八日电　上海第四漂染厂革命群众组织的负责人，参加厂革命委员会的领导工作以后，遵循毛主席的教导，坚决反对做官当老爷的资产阶级作风，经常深入群众，遇事和群众商量，大大密切了上下级关系、干群关系，在厂内形成了既严肃、紧张，又团结、活泼的政治局面。
    跳出事务圈子　走到群众中去
    这个厂的革命委员会成立以后，参加革委会的革命群众组织负责人整天忙于事务，毛主席著作学得少了，车间里也不大跑了，群众对他们的意见也多起来了。驻厂空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的同志发现这个问题，及时向他们指出：现在你们的地位变化了，要正确处理干群关系和上下级关系，否则会走到高高在上、脱离群众的错路上去。参加革委会的革命群众组织负责人带着这个问题，认真学习了毛主席著作以及山东省革命委员会关于思想革命化的十条规定和《红旗》杂志评论员文章。
    毛主席说：“共产党员绝不可脱离群众，绝不可高踞于群众之上，做官当老爷，而应当以普通劳动者的姿态，出现在群众面前，深入于群众之中，同群众打成一片。”毛主席的这一指示，给他们极大的教育。他们联想到，在这次运动中，有些工人家庭出身的干部，由于地位的改变，又没有好好听毛主席的话，长期脱离群众，终于犯了严重的错误。今天我们掌权了，地位改变了，一定要密切联系群众，永远保持劳动人民的本色，否则也会蜕化变质，滑到修正主义的道路上去。
    在认识提高的基础上，他们订出了本厂革委会革命化的五条措施。十三个委员绝大部分都不脱离生产，到各车间和工人同劳动，同学习。脱产人员每星期也要劳动两次。他们坚决执行了这个规定，积极参加劳动，不怕脏，不怕累，那里最艰苦，就到那里和群众一起战斗，得到了群众的赞扬。
    虚心倾听不同意见
    过去，这个厂的革命群众组织负责人不大听得进反面意见，尤其听不进反对过他们的人的不同意见。
    工厂革委会建立初期，他们把这种不好的作风带进了革委会。驻厂的毛泽东思想宣传队却带来了另一种作风。他们热情欢迎群众提意见，主动地去找提意见的人谈心，并且深入车间，解决问题，结果把全厂最落后的一个小组改造成为全厂学习毛主席著作最先进的小组。解放军同志的模范行动，教育了厂革委会的领导成员。他们针对自己的活思想，反复地学习了毛主席著作，认识到听不得不同意见是私心杂念的一种表现。他们决心在工作中切实加以改进。有一次，厂革委会主任委员在处理工人和半工半读学生之间的矛盾的时候，他在气愤中对学生说：“你们不要太凶，我们革委会忍耐是有限度的。”当时有些群众听了，就对他提出意见说，你们想用革委会的权来压人，想秋后算账是吗？当天晚上，在厂革委会学习会上，大家针对这件事学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，我们有些什么不好的东西舍不得丢掉呢？”根据毛主席的教导，大家认识到，看来这是脱口而出的一句话，但实质上是反映了高人一等的官架子作风，必须引起重视，不能让这种官气滋长起来。
    在全厂开展革命大批判的时候，有的群众尖锐地批评说：你们这些头头，只在嘴上讲大批判，就是不发动群众。厂革委会成员听了这些意见，检查了前一段的工作，觉得的确没有把革命大批判放在首要地位，自己不带头，群众也没有充分发动起来，于是，马上深入车间带头开展大批判，还吸收过去对他们有意见的同志参加搞大批判工作，这样，就把全厂的革命大批判大大向前推进了一步。
    集中起来　坚持下去
    通过几个月斗争的锻炼，这个厂革委会中的革命群众组织负责人切身体会到，“群众是真正的英雄”“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力”，这是千真万确的真理。厂革委会每次作出决定，都要先找群众商量，到群众中去征求意见，然后集中起来，再拿到群众中贯彻下去。
    最近，这个厂的革命群众组织负责人认真地学习了毛主席关于干部问题的一系列指示以后，对工厂的原党委书记进行了阶级分析，认为他虽然犯了严重错误，并不是敌我矛盾，应该解放。但是要解放这个干部，群众是否通得过呢？厂革委会同志就决定先分头召开新老工人、干部座谈会，向群众征求意见。群众根据毛主席“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法”的教导，对工厂原党委书记进行了全面的阶级分析，不但认为这位干部应该解放，还批评了厂革命群众组织负责人没有抓紧对干部做思想工作。厂革委会把群众意见集中起来以后，就作出决定，把工厂原党委书记解放了。
    由于这个工厂革委会成员能够认真地按照毛主席指示办事，正确地处理上下级关系，主动联系群众，和群众打成一片，所以群众更加信任他们，爱护他们，支持他们。群众有意见就说，有好主意就提，全厂团结一致，上下关系密切，革命和生产都出现了崭新的面貌。（附图片）
