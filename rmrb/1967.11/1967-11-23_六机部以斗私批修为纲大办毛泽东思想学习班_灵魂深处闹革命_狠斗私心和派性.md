The revolutionary cadres and masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery, after achieving revolutionary great unity according to administrative departments, have, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teaching that "the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles is to grasp ideological and political education," and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, swiftly organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes with over 95% of the leading cadres and masses participating. Those who participate in the study classes all bring their problems and actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China, and his works. Through study, the broad masses of cadres and the people have further fought against the "self" character, exposed the petty-bourgeois factionalism, established the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, and consolidated and developed the revolutionary great unity in politics and ideology. This has laid a solid foundation for achieving the revolutionary three-in-one combination and for carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units.

To fight selfishness, one must first see it

In the process of holding large-scale study classes with the focus on fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the first problem encountered by the leaders of the mass organizations and the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery was that everyone generally felt they had no selfishness to fight and that if there was any selfishness to fight, it should be someone else's. The reason for this situation was that some leaders of the mass organizations and revolutionary masses had the idea of "I alone am revolutionary." They thought, "I rebelled early and am the most revolutionary," "My general direction is correct and I make few mistakes," "I am the most active in achieving revolutionary great unity according to administrative departments, and I did not seize power for personal gain, so what selfish motives could I have?" Others said, "I am not a leader and do not want to be a leader, nor have I actively engaged in 'internal warfare,' I have always been correct and have no selfish motives," and so on. Therefore, to carry out and deepen the fight against selfishness, the first step was to make everyone see the "self" character in their minds. The fight against selfishness is mainly to fight one's own selfishness. The shortcomings and errors of others should be let others speak for themselves, and each should engage in more self-criticism.

However, what method can make everyone see the "self" character in their minds? Chairman Mao teaches: "In order to make progress in ideology, one must also make progress in politics, and this requires learning Marxism." The only correct method is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works. Under the guidance and patient help of the People's Liberation Army, many comrades, with the problem of feeling they had no selfishness to fight, read Chairman Mao's books, especially studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions word by word, repeatedly studying, repeatedly thinking, repeatedly comparing, and repeatedly questioning themselves. Chairman Mao says: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." When studying here, some comrades asked themselves: Why, in a situation where the two factions in the Sixth Ministry of Machinery have no fundamental conflicts of interest, do I insist on trying to destroy the other side? Why am I not willing to unite according to administrative departments as the masses demand? And so on. By reflecting and thinking, they saw the petty-bourgeois factionalism in their minds. Following this clue, they found many past incidents that revolved around the interests of small groups. A comrade who did not want to be a leader and encouraged their spouse to give up their position to others, thinking they were selfless, said: "I did not want to be a leader and encouraged my spouse to give up their position to others. At first glance, it seems like there is no selfish motive, but in fact, it was for the interests of the original small group I belonged to. Isn't this selfish?" In this way, leaders found, and the masses also found, mutually inspiring and helping each other, resulting in the discovery of many words and deeds that do not conform to Mao Zedong Thought. Finally, everyone deeply realized that their selfish motives were not few and that it was not a matter of having no selfishness to fight, but of having to fight it fiercely. Some comrades deeply felt that not seeing one's own "self" character is mainly a matter of stance. Standing on the stance of a small group, wearing petty-bourgeois factionalist colored glasses, one cannot see one's own selfishness. Using Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, standing on the stance of proletarian party spirit, one sees one's own selfishness.

To fight selfishness, one must dare to expose it

After seeing one's own selfish motives, there are still many concerns about whether to expose them. For example, some comrades are afraid that the original faction will blame and criticize them, leading to a loss of the masses; some are afraid of exposing their weaknesses, fearing that the original opposing faction will grab them by the collar; some are afraid of exposing their ugliness, fearing it will make them look bad; some are afraid that if the great unity has a setback, they will be at a disadvantage. It is precisely because of these various erroneous thoughts that some comrades, when exposing their selfish motives, act according to the so-called "principle of equivalence," exposing as much as others expose, exposing a little and hiding a little; some expose distant matters but not near ones, expose public matters but not secret ones, expose general matters but not main ones; some plan to "recognize and change it themselves." Therefore, overcoming the fear and exposing the "self" character is a tough battle in the process of fighting selfishness.

To help comrades win this tough battle, the People's Liberation Army comrades, targeting many active thoughts in the process of exposing selfish motives, organized everyone to repeatedly study and discuss Chairman Mao's great call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism and his discussions on criticism and self-criticism. They also introduced the army's experience in exposing and fighting selfish motives to everyone. In this way, everyone finally realized that fearing to expose selfish motives is mainly because the "self" character in one's mind is at play. Many comrades, following the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, at the discussion meetings of the study classes, with the spirit of seeing red in the face, dared to expose many active thoughts without fear of pain or ugliness.

A staff member of a mass organization in the Education Bureau, after the great unity, to show his "high moral character," wanted to see the other side's joke and nominated a comrade from the original opposing organization to be the staff member of the Revolutionary Committee. Later, she regretted giving away her vote and wanted to pull the other side down, resulting in a stalemate. In the study of fighting selfishness, she realized that this was the "self" character at play. She wanted to expose it but was afraid of being responsible for delaying the work of the Revolutionary Committee. Her thoughts struggled intensely. After being enlightened and helped by the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, especially after studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "a Communist should be frank, honest, active, and regard revolutionary interests as the first commandment of life," she felt even more uneasy. She thought, when I rebelled against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, I was so brave and decisive, but why am I so weak when rebelling against the "self" character in my own mind? This is still a revolutionary? She made up her mind to get rid of the fear and throw away the selfish motives, exposing her mistakes and shortcomings in their entirety. Just as she was about to expose her selfish motives at that meeting, the comrade she wanted to pull down from the Revolutionary Committee staff exposed his selfish motives first. She also exposed her selfish motives. The previously dull study meeting suddenly became lively, and the selection of the Revolutionary Committee members, which had been undecided for a month, was finally resolved to everyone's satisfaction.

In the study classes held by the Sixth Ministry of Machinery, timely discovering and cultivating typical examples of exposing and fighting selfish motives, and holding large-scale meetings to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, played an active role in helping the masses recognize the harm of the "self" character and daring to expose selfish motives. At these meetings, comrades from the original two factions, from mutual observation, changed to mutual inspiration and promotion, forming a revolutionary competition of exposing and fighting selfish motives at large meetings, medium meetings, small meetings, and among the masses, with everyone exposing, leaders leading the masses, and the masses promoting the leaders. Everyone regarded exposing deeply and fighting fiercely as glory and fearing ugliness and pain as shame. In this way, the "self" character was dug deeper, and the mountain-topism and small-groupism that were beautified by petty-bourgeois factionalism became the "rats crossing the street" that everyone shouts to beat.

To fight selfishness, one must thoroughly expose it

After exposing the selfish motives, daring to fight them fiercely is the key to whether one can thoroughly expose them. In the process of fighting selfishness, the revolutionary masses of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery also had various ideological obstacles. For example, some were afraid that fiercely fighting their own "self" character would, after being "elevated," negate their correct direction and negate their achievements in the Cultural Revolution; some were afraid of inciting public criticism and ridicule, saying they were "opportunists"; some were afraid of losing the masses and not being able to do things inside and out, and so on. Therefore, they often forgave themselves and did not dare to engage in self-criticism, saying things like "mistakes are inevitable." Even if they engaged in some self-criticism, it was only about specific incidents, not daring to touch the sore spots, not daring to raise it to the level of principles. In this way, the "self" character could not be thoroughly exposed, petty-bourgeois factionalism could not be overthrown, and it would emerge again at the right time.

Facing this situation, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army further guided everyone to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, understanding their profound and great significance. The comrades of the People's Liberation Army also helped everyone further study Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and his brilliant works "On Correcting Erroneous Ideas in the Party" and "Rectifying the Party's Style," using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight and expose the "self" character, overthrow petty-bourgeois factionalism, and break selfishness to establish public-mindedness. Thus, a high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works surged again in each study class. The comrades, with a hunger for knowledge, read Chairman Mao's books and used the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought and the three brilliant images of Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man Moving Mountains to examine and compare themselves, fiercely fighting selfish motives and factionalism. They pointed out at the meetings: "The 'self' character is the root of all evil, the breeding ground for revisionism. If a revolutionary carries the burden of the 'self' character, it is like a person carrying a big stone and can never keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments. The 'self' character obscures one's vision, making one unable to see the road indicated by Chairman Mao, unable to correctly recognize and solve problems. The result is confusion between right and wrong, friend and foe, harming oneself, harming others, and harming the revolution. Some comrades said painfully: "From the formation of the two factions, we have been thinking day and night about how to deal with the other side, letting a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and ghosts and monsters laugh at us. This handful of bad guys even fanned the wind and lit the fire, trying to take advantage of the situation to cause trouble. 'Internal warfare' really weakened the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and fattened the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must learn from this experience and resolutely act according to Chairman Mao's great call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, develop and consolidate the revolutionary great unity in politics and ideology, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end."

Breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, a united and fighting atmosphere

Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The process of the proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery from seeing the selfish motives, exposing them, to thoroughly exposing them is also the process of breaking selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, a process of greatly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, after this study, the revolutionary great unity of the Sixth Ministry of Machinery was further consolidated, and a united and fighting atmosphere emerged in the organs. The fighting spirit of the revolutionary masses has never been as high as it is now; the political atmosphere of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works has never been as thick as it is now. In the past, due to the interference of petty-bourgeois factionalism, some units could not unite several mass organizations. Now, the revolutionary masses are united, everyone's mood is relaxed, and they help and care for each other. Some comrades recall the past and compare it with the present, full of confidence: "In the past, it was back to back, after unity it was face to face, after the study class, it is shoulder to shoulder and heart to heart. We are united like this, and we will definitely achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat."

    六机部以斗私批修为纲大办毛泽东思想学习班
    灵魂深处闹革命　狠斗私心和派性
    头头带群众，群众促头头，活学活用毛主席著作，亮私，斗私，搞臭私字，大立公字，巩固和发展了革命大联合，为实现革命三结合和开展本单位斗批改打下了良好基础
    据新华社二十二日讯　本社通讯员、记者报道：第六机械工业部的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，在实现按行政部门的革命大联合以后，遵照毛主席“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节”的教导，在解放军同志的帮助下，以“斗私，批修”为纲，迅速办起了有百分之九十五以上的领导干部和群众参加的毛泽东思想学习班。参加学习班的同志，都带着问题活学活用毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的重要指示和毛主席的著作。通过学习，广大干部和群众进一步狠斗了“私”字，搞臭了小资产阶级的派性，树立了伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，从政治上思想上巩固和发展了革命的大联合，并为实现革命的三结合和开展本单位的斗批改打下了良好的基础。
    斗私，先要看到私
    六机部的群众组织负责人和革命群众在大办学习班，以“斗私，批修”为纲，开展自我教育的过程中，遇到的第一个问题就是普遍觉得自己无私可斗，要斗就斗别人的私。出现这种情况的原因是，有些群众组织的负责人和革命群众，都有“唯我独革”的思想。他们认为“我造反早，最革命”，“我大方向正确，犯错误少”，“按行政部门大联合我最积极，造反夺权也不是为个人，有啥私心？”也有的说“我不是头头，又不想当头头，也没有积极地打‘内战’，我一直正确，没有私心”；等等。因此，要把斗私开展起来，深入下去，第一步就要使大家看到自己头脑中有私，斗私主要是斗自己的私，别人的缺点、错误，让人家自己讲，各自多作自我批评。
    但是，用什么办法能够使大家看到自己头脑中的“私”字呢？毛主席教导说：“在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步，这就需要学习马克思主义”。唯一正确的办法，就是活学活用毛主席著作。在解放军同志的指导和耐心帮助下，许多同志带着认为自己无私可斗的问题读毛主席的书，特别是一字一句的学习毛主席的最新指示，反复学习，反复思考，反复对照，反复自问。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”学到这里，有的同志自问：我为什么在六机部内两派没有根本利害冲突的情况下，一定要想搞垮对方呢？群众都要求按行政部门实行革命大联合，我为什么不愿意呢？等等。照一照，想一想，就看清了自己头脑中存在着小资产阶级派性。顺着这个线索，找到了过去围绕着小团体利益打转的许多事例。一位自己不想当头头，又动员爱人把席位让给别人，自认为无私的同志说：“我不当头头，又动员爱人把席位让给别人，乍看起来，好象没私心，其实，这是为了让原来自己那一派的头头上去，是从小团体的利益出发的，这不是私心吗？”这样，头头找，群众也找，互相启发，互相帮助，结果，找出了不少不符合毛泽东思想的言行，终于使大家深刻认识到自己的私心并不少，不是无私可斗，而是必须狠斗猛斗。一些同志深有体会地说，看不到自己的“私”字，主要是立场问题。站在小团体的立场上，带着小资产阶级派性的有色眼镜，就看不到自己的私，用毛泽东思想挂帅，站在无产阶级党性立场上，就看到了自己的私。
    斗私，要敢亮私
    看到自己的私心后，敢不敢把它亮出来，还有很多顾虑。例如，有的同志怕原来自己一派的同志埋怨、责怪，以致失掉群众；有的怕露了底，泄了“密”，被原来另一派的同志抓住小辫子；有的怕亮了丑，自己脸上不好看；有的怕大联合一旦有反复，自己被动。正是由于有着多种多样的错误思想，有些同志在亮私的时候便“看风使舵”，按照所谓“对等原则”办事，别人亮到那里，自己亮到那里，亮一点留一点；有的亮远的不亮近的，亮公开的，不亮秘密的，亮一般的，不亮主要的；也有的打算“自己认识了，改了算了”。因此，克服“怕”字，亮出“私”字，这是斗私过程中的一场硬仗。
    为了帮助同志们打好这场硬仗，解放军同志又针对亮私中的许多活思想，组织大家反复学习和讨论了毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召和关于批评与自我批评的论述，并向大家介绍了部队亮私斗私的经验。这样，终于使大家认识到，怕亮私，主要还是自己头脑中的“私”字作怪。许多同志遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，在学习班的讨论会上，以刺刀见红的精神，不怕痛，不怕丑地亮出了许多活思想。
    教育局的一个群众组织的勤务员，在大联合以后，为了表示自己的“高风格”，想看对方的笑话，推举了原来对立组织的一个同志到大联委去当勤务员。后来她觉得把这一票白白让给了别人，便后悔起来，又要把对方拉下来，因而双方相持不下，形成僵局。在斗私学习中，她认识到这是“私”字作怪，想亮出来，但是又怕负耽误大联委工作的责任，思想斗争很激烈，经过解放军同志的启发帮助，特别是学习了毛主席“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命”的教导，她心里更加不安。她想，自己过去造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，那样勇敢，那样坚决，而今天造自己头脑里“私”字的反时，又为什么这样手软呢？这还算得什么无产阶级革命派？她下定决心去掉“怕”字，丢掉“私”字，把自己的错误缺点，原原本本地讲出来。正当她要亮私的那次会上，她想把人家从大联委勤务组中拉下马的那位同志，却抢在她前面亮了自己的私心，她也亮了私。过去一向沉闷的学习会突然活跃了起来，拖了一个月定不下来的大联委人选，这时也就得到了一致满意的解决。
    在六机部举办的学习班中，及时发现和培养亮私斗私的典型，大开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，对帮助群众认识“私”字的危害和敢于亮出私心，起了积极的推动作用。在这些讲用会上，原来两派的同志，由互相观望，变为互相启发，互相促进，形成了大会亮，中会亮，小会亮，群众亮，人人亮，头头带群众，群众促头头的一场亮私、斗私的革命竞赛。人人以亮得深斗得狠为光荣，以怕丑、怕痛为耻辱。这样，“私”字越挖越深，原来被小资产阶级派性美化起来的山头主义、小团体主义，就变成了人人喊打的“过街老鼠”。
    斗私，必须搞臭私
    私亮出来以后，敢不敢狠狠地斗，是能不能搞臭私的关键。六机部革命群众在斗私过程中，也是有各种思想障碍的。例如：有人怕狠斗自己的“私”字，“上纲”以后，就会否定了自己的大方向，否定了自己在文化大革命中的成绩；有人怕惹起群众议论和讽刺，说自己是“投机”；也有人怕从此失掉了群众，里外不好做人，等等。因而，他们往往原谅自己，不敢作自我批评，还说什么“错误难免”。即使是作些自我批评，也是就事论事，不敢触及痛处，不敢提到原则高度。这样，“私”字就斗不臭，小资产阶级派性就斗不倒，一遇适当时机，又会冒出来。
    针对这种情况，解放军同志又进一步引导大家反复学习毛主席要斗私，批修的最新指示，领会其深刻而伟大的意义。解放军同志还帮助大家进一步学好毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》《整顿党的作风》等光辉著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，去斗臭“私”字，斗倒小资产阶级派性，破私立公。于是一个活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，又在各个学习班掀起。同志们如饥如渴地读毛主席的书，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想和张思德、白求恩、老愚公三个光辉形象检查对照自己，狠斗私心派性。他们在讲用会上一致指出：“私”字是万恶之源，是产生修正主义的温床。一个革命者要是背上了“私”字的包袱，就象一个人抱着大石头走路，永远也无法紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。“私”字障目，就看不见毛主席指引的道路，不能正确认识问题，解决问题，其结果也就是非不清，敌我不分，害人，害己，更害了革命。有的同志痛心地说：“我们从形成两派起就日夜想着如何对付对方，让党内一小撮走资派和牛鬼蛇神在一旁看笑话。这一小撮坏家伙甚至煽阴风，点鬼火，企图乘机捣乱。‘内战’真是打瘦了无产阶级革命派，养胖了党内一小撮走资派。我们一定要接受经验教训，坚决照毛主席‘斗私，批修’的伟大号召办事，从政治上思想上发展和巩固革命大联合，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。”
    破私立公，一派团结战斗的气氛
    毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”六机部的无产阶级革命派，从看到私、亮出私到斗臭私的过程，也就是破私立公的过程，是大树特树毛泽东思想绝对权威的过程。因而，经过这次学习，六机部的革命大联合进一步巩固了，机关里出现了一派团结战斗的气氛。革命群众的斗志，从来没有象现在这样昂扬；活学活用毛主席著作的政治空气，也从来没有象现在这样浓厚。过去由于小资产阶级派性作怪，几个群众组织不能联合的一些单位，现在革命群众团结在一起，人人心情舒畅，互相帮助，互相关心。有的同志回忆过去，对比现在，满怀信心地说：“过去是背靠背，联合以后是面对面，经过学习班的学习，是肩并肩，心连心。我们团结得这样紧，就一定能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。”
