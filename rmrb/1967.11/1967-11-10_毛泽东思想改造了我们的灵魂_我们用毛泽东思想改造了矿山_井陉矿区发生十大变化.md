In the assistance of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, the Jixian Mining Bureau of Hebei Province has launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The spiritual outlook of the broad masses of workers has undergone profound changes. The entire mining area is in the midst of a thunderous and magnificent Cultural Revolution, with production booming. The workers say: Mao Zedong Thought has transformed our souls, and we have used Mao Zedong Thought to transform the mine.

Before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the Jixian Mining Bureau opposed Mao Zedong Thought and frantically promoted material incentives, money as the lever, and other counter-revolutionary revisionist black goods, seriously affecting the thought revolutionization of the workers. In March of this year, after the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army entered the mine, they firmly supported the revolutionary masses, together with the broad revolutionary masses, used the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to carry out in-depth revolutionary criticism and struggle, thoroughly eliminated the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and specially established the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought. In the process of revolutionary criticism and struggle, the entire mining area achieved great unity and the three-in-one combination of the revolution. In the process of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army introduced to the broad revolutionary workers the experience of the army in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, mobilized the masses to launch a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and studied and applied the "Old Three Articles" to promote thought revolutionization, causing the entire mining area to undergo ten major changes.

1. The broad masses of workers have an even deeper class sentiment towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, loving, believing, worshipping, and being loyal to Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought without limit. The entire mining area, from the office to each mine, from the surface to the underground, from the workshop to the dormitory, from the street to the dormitory, is hung with portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. Cadres, workers, family members, and children all carry the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and always remember the great leader Chairman Mao. To express their deep class sentiment towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, many workers, like the army, pay tribute to Chairman Mao every day, wish Chairman Mao longevity every day, sing "The East is Red" every day, report work to Chairman Mao every day, and report to Chairman Mao every day.

2. The broad masses of workers have an unprecedented awareness of studying Chairman Mao's works. In the past, even those with culture and time did not study Chairman Mao's works frequently; now, even those without culture and time insist on studying, truly achieving everyone studies and studies every day, not eating or sleeping also to study. Many units have achieved: cadres take the lead in studying, fixed time collective study, spare time personal study, busy work insist on studying, encounter difficulties immediately study, receive tasks study in advance, combine movements to study key points, and repeatedly study basic viewpoints. The entire mining area is a new situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

3. The broad masses of workers' world outlook has undergone a great change. In the past, some workers often revolved around the "self" when facing a matter; now, everyone faces a matter, first thinks of the collective, the revolution, and a "public" character.

4. The political atmosphere of caring about state affairs is thick. In the past, some people did not care enough about state affairs; now, they say: "Personal matters are small even if they are big, state matters are big even if they are small." Many workers arrive early for work and use their spare time to make revolution after work, busy until late at night before going home.

5. The class and class struggle viewpoint has been greatly improved, encountering wrong thoughts to criticize, seeing revisionist poison to resist.

6. The broad masses of workers' spirit of mining for the revolution has been greatly carried forward. In the past, some workers would pick and choose when mining, willing to mine where the coal is fast; now, they mine with one heart for the revolution, mining difficult, labor-intensive, thin coal seams, and low-yield working faces, competing to mine. The 416 team of the South Gully mining and tunneling team of Mine No. 4 has a narrow and low working face with a very thin coal seam. The workers studied the "Old Three Articles" and, for several consecutive months, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle, did not complain of hardship, did not shout of fatigue, and completed the production task overfulfilled every month.

7. In the past, mutual help and support between individuals and teams were less. Now, if one person has difficulties, everyone comes to support, if one team has difficulties, the entire bureau comes to support, and the spirit of communism is greatly carried forward.

8. The leadership style of cadres has undergone a great change. In the past, some leaders at the bureau, mine, department, and office levels often sat in the office, did not go deep into the grassroots, did not approach the masses, did not consult with the masses when there were matters, and the relationship between cadres and the masses was relatively distant. Now, the revolutionary cadres at the bureau and mine levels and the revolutionary cadres at the bureau office, department, and office levels often go deep into the production front line, mix with the workers, learn from the masses, and become the masses' little students, work together, chat, and study Chairman Mao's works together during rest time, winning the praise of the workers and strengthening the relationship between cadres and the masses.

9. The relationship between politics and business has been properly handled. In the past, some business and technical cadres buried themselves in business and did not ask about politics; now, they generally achieve: grasp work first grasp the study and application of Chairman Mao's works; grasp production first grasp people's thoughts; look at results first look at people's thought revolutionization; summarize experience first summarize whether proletarian politics is highlighted. Always pay attention to highlighting proletarian politics in everything.

10. The frugal and thrifty style is greatly carried forward. In the past, there was little management of production waste; now, it is frugal and thrifty to make the revolution; in the past, production equipment reached out to the state; now, everyone takes the initiative to be self-reliant; in the past, recycled materials were scattered everywhere; now, recycled materials are collected everywhere. Since the Cultural Revolution, some "old difficult" problems in production have been solved one by one under the principle of frugality and thrift. In the past, the mine used pit props as supports, consuming a large amount of national timber. Now, the workers voluntarily use metal supports to replace pit props. From January to August, they saved the country more than 3,000 cubic meters of timber. For machine group operations, in the past, they only thought of asking the leadership to solve the problem. Now, the workers are self-reliant, take the initiative to work with their hands and brains, and carry out extensive innovations. Just one technological innovation has increased work efficiency by 20 to 30 percent, saving the country more than ten million yuan. Through technological innovation, the backward falling coal mining method has been eliminated, and the long-wall coal mining method has been adopted, basically achieving the mechanization of mining, loading, and transportation. The recovery rate of raw coal has been increased from 55 to 60 percent to over 86 percent, making a great contribution to the completion of the production task.

### 毛泽东思想改造了我们的灵魂  我们用毛泽东思想改造了矿山  井陉矿区发生十大变化

    毛泽东思想改造了我们的灵魂  我们用毛泽东思想改造了矿山
    井陉矿区发生十大变化
    据新华社保定九日电　在人民解放军北京部队某部帮助下，河北省井陉矿务局掀起了活学活用毛主席著作新高潮，广大职工精神面貌发生了深刻变化。整个矿区文化大革命轰轰烈烈，生产热气腾腾，职工们说：毛泽东思想改造了我们的灵魂，我们用毛泽东思想又改造了矿山。
    无产阶级文化大革命以前，井陉矿务局党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派敌视毛泽东思想，疯狂地推行物质刺激、金钱挂帅等反革命修正主义黑货，严重影响了职工的思想革命化。今年三月，解放军指战员进入矿山以后，坚定地支持无产阶级革命派，同广大革命群众一起，运用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，深入开展革命的大批判，彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线的流毒，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。在革命的大批判中，全矿区实现了革命大联合和革命三结合。在无产阶级文化大革命向前发展的过程中，解放军指战员向广大革命职工广泛介绍了部队活学活用毛主席著作的经验，发动群众掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，大学大用“老三篇”，促进思想革命化，使整个矿区发生了十大变化。
    一、广大职工对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的阶级感情更加深厚，对毛主席、对毛泽东思想更加无限热爱，无限信仰，无限崇拜，无限忠诚。整个矿区从机关到各矿，从井上到井下，从车间到工房，从街头到宿舍，到处都悬挂着毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，干部、职工、家属、小孩，人人身揣红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，心中时刻怀念着伟大领袖毛主席。为了表达他们对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限深厚的阶级感情，许多工人也象部队一样，天天向毛主席致敬，天天祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！天天高唱《东方红》，天天向毛主席请示工作，天天向毛主席汇报。
    二、广大职工学习毛主席著作的自觉性空前提高。过去有文化、有时间的人学习毛主席著作也不经常；现在是没文化、没时间的人也坚持学，真正做到了人人学、天天学，不吃饭不睡觉也要学。不少单位做到了：领导干部带头学，固定时间集体学，业余个人抓紧学，工作紧张坚持学，碰到困难立即学，接受任务事先学，结合运动重点学，基本观点反复学。整个矿区，是一派大学大用毛主席著作的新局面。
    三、广大职工的世界观有了大改变。过去，有些工人群众一事当前常围着“私”字打转转，现在大家一事当前，首先想的是集体、是革命、是一个“公”字。
    四、关心国家大事的政治空气浓浓的。过去，有些人关心国家大事不够；现在，他们说：“个人的事再大也是小事，国家的事再小也是大事。”许多工人上班提前到，下班就利用业余时间闹革命，忙到深夜才回家。
    五、阶级和阶级斗争的观点大提高，遇见错误思想就提出批评，见了修正主义流毒就抵制。
    六、广大职工为革命挖煤的精神大发扬。过去，有的工人挖煤时常挑挑拣拣，那里出煤快愿在那里挖；现在，一个心眼为革命挖煤，难挖的、费劲大的、煤层薄的、出煤少的工作面，争着去挖。四矿南井沟采掘队四一六组，工作面又窄又低，煤层很薄。工人们学习了“老三篇”，连续几个月，发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，不叫一声苦，不喊一声累，月月超额完成了生产任务。
    七、过去人与人，队与队之间互相帮助、互相支援少。现在，一人有困难，大家来支援，一队有困难，全局来支援，共产主义精神大发扬。
    八、干部的领导作风大改变。过去局、矿、科、室一些领导干部，经常坐在办公室里，不深入基层，不接近群众，有事不找群众商量，干群关系比较疏远，现在局、矿两级领导班子的革命干部和局机关科、室的革命干部，经常深入到生产第一线，和工人打成一片，拜群众为师，当群众的小学生，边劳动，边谈心，休息时和工人共同学习毛主席著作，得到了工人的好评，密切了干群关系。
    九、政治和业务的关系摆正了，处理得好了。过去，一些业务、技术干部，埋头业务，不问政治；现在，普遍作到抓工作先抓活学活用毛主席著作；抓生产先抓人的思想；看成果先看人的思想革命化；总结经验先总结自己是否突出无产阶级政治。时时事事注意突出无产阶级政治。
    十、勤俭节约的风尚大发扬。过去是生产浪费很少有人管，现在是勤俭节约闹革命；过去是生产设备伸手向国家要，现在是人人动手自力更生；过去是回收物资遍地丢，现在是回收物资遍地收。文化大革命以来，生产上的一些“老大难”问题，在勤俭节约的原则下，也一个一个得到了解决。过去矿井使用坑木做支架，要消耗国家大量的木材，现在工人们自动地用金属支架来代替坑木。一至八月份为国家节约木材三千多立方。机组作业，过去光想叫领导解决，现在工人们自力更生，自己动手动脑，大搞革新，仅一项技术革新，就提高了工效百分之二十至三十，为国家节约十多万元。通过技术革新，还消灭了落后的落垛采煤法，采用了长壁采煤法，基本上实现了采、装、运机械化。使原煤回收率由百分之五十五至六十，提高到百分之八十六以上，为完成生产任务贡献了巨大力量。
