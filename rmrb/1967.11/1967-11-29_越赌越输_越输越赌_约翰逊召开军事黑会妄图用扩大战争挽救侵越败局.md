The more they bet, the more they lose; the more they lose, the more they bet. Johnson convenes a military black meeting in an attempt to salvage the failing Vietnam invasion by escalating the war.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Washington: In the face of the increasingly dire situation in the Vietnam War, growing domestic opposition, and unprecedented internal strife within the ruling class, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, on the 21st, gathered military and political leaders in the White House for a secret meeting on the Vietnam War. The meeting's proceedings indicate that American imperialism has no effective solution to reverse its failing fortunes in Vietnam. Instead, it recklessly seeks to intensify and expand the war in a desperate struggle for survival.

Although the U.S. government has kept the details of this White House war meeting under wraps, Western media reports before and after the meeting reveal that it was a "military conference." Johnson advocates for accelerating ground operations in Vietnam at the start of next year and speeding up the deployment of more troops to South Vietnam to escalate the Vietnam War to a "new phase." According to reports, Johnson, who is facing strong criticism from various quarters ahead of next year's presidential election, hopes to gain political capital by escalating the war.

According to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Russell, the U.S. military commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, who returned to the country to discuss the expansion of the war, held a private meeting with Johnson on the 16th. In addition to reporting to Johnson on the military's needs and other aspects of the war, Westmoreland also discussed the so-called "sanctuaries" in Cambodia and Laos, which are repeatedly used as pretexts to expand the war. This fully exposes the American imperialists' wolfish ambitions to expand the Vietnam War.

On the day of the White House black meeting, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that the number of recruits for January next year would surge to 34,000, reaching the highest level in 14 months, to meet the needs of escalating the Vietnam War.

    约翰逊召开军事黑会妄图用扩大战争挽救侵越败局
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：在侵越战争越败越惨，国内人民的反对越来越激烈，统治集团内部争吵空前激化的情况下，美帝国主义头子约翰逊二十一日纠集军政头目在白宫召开了一次有关侵越战争的黑会。会议情况表明，美帝国主义根本找不到挽救侵越败局的灵丹妙方，它妄图进一步加剧和扩大战争，进行垂死的挣扎。
    尽管美国官方对这次白宫战争黑会的内情守口如瓶，但是，据西方报刊在会议前后透露，这是一次“军事会议”，约翰逊赞成在明年初“加速在越南的地面战争”，并且加速向南越派遣侵越炮灰，以便变本加厉地把侵越战争推进到一个“新阶段”。据报道，面临着明年的总统选举而在国内正受到各方面强烈抨击的约翰逊，想通过加剧战争“显露一手”，以便为明年的总统竞选捞取点资本。
    据参院军事委员会主席拉塞尔透露，回国密商扩大战争的侵越美军头目威斯特摩兰在十六日同约翰逊举行的私下会谈中，除了向约翰逊“汇报了军队的需要以及战争其他各方面的问题”外，还谈到为扩大战争制造借口而一再叫嚷的所谓柬埔寨和老挝的“庇护所”问题。这就完全暴露了美帝国主义者蓄意扩大侵越战争的狼子野心。
    在白宫黑会的当天，美国国防部即宣布明年一月份的征兵人数猛增到三万四千人，达到十四个月来的最高峰，以适应扩大侵越战争的需要。
