The torrents of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have brought a large number of revolutionary "little people" to the forefront of the revolutionary leadership, entering the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre.

More than half of the standing committee members and most of the members of the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee are young people in their twenties and thirties who have been selected from the revolutionary masses. Some are revolutionary workers, some are revolutionary students, and some are ordinary cadres who have never held leadership positions.

In late January of this year, shortly after the victory of the Qingdao Municipal Proletarian Revolutionary Faction in seizing power, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao immediately dispatched five senior leaders with rich experience in class struggle to participate in the temporary power organ of the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Three-in-One Leadership. They humbly learned from the revolutionary new cadres, and regarded leading this cadre as their inescapable revolutionary duty and as a practical action to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Passing on the experience of "following from above and relying on the masses below"

In the initial period after the seizure of power in Qingdao, the work of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee was extremely busy. In this situation, some committee members could not sit still and their study of Chairman Mao's works became somewhat relaxed. The military leaders felt that this was a very dangerous trend and that it was necessary to help the revolutionary young cadres establish a firm belief in "following from above and relying on the masses below." Following from above means closely following Chairman Mao, closely following Mao Zedong Thought, and closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Relying on the masses below means relying on the broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary faction, consulting with the masses on every matter, and humbly being students of the masses. The military leaders repeatedly emphasized the importance of studying Chairman Mao's works in the Municipal Revolutionary Committee and, starting from that time, began to bring the army's "daily reading" system to the Revolutionary Committee. Members of the Revolutionary Committee set aside one hour each day to study Chairman Mao's works; two half-days were also arranged each week as collective study time. During this time, the veterans and the young cadres together exposed their thoughts, fought against selfishness, and checked whether there were any phenomena in their work that went against Chairman Mao's teachings, correcting them as soon as they were discovered.

The military leaders also often educated the revolutionary young cadres on the mass line, helping them firmly establish a mass perspective. Especially after the dissemination of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the military political commissar and the main responsible person of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, Comrade Chen Jide, together with the revolutionary young cadres, conducted in-depth and detailed investigation and research work across all fronts in the city.

Respecting the pioneering spirit of the revolutionary young cadres

The revolutionary young cadres in the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee are all proletarian revolutionaries who have fought their way out of the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line. They are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, daring to think, speak, act, and revolutionize. They have a keen sense of new things, high enthusiasm, and initiative.

To fully utilize the strengths of the revolutionary young cadres in daring to think and act in the revolutionary three-in-one leadership cadre, the military leaders boldly and freely used the revolutionary new cadres. In most cases, they encouraged the revolutionary young cadres to "take the lead," while they themselves acted as the young cadres' strong rear guard and "advisors." Once, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a mobilization meeting for cadre participation in the first-line criticism and struggle. The revolutionary young cadres felt that this meeting was very important, involving the issue of revolutionizing the entire municipal office, and wanted to ask the military leaders to give the mobilization report. The military leaders thought it would be better to let the young cadres do it, as seeing the world more times would mean more opportunities for tempering. They analyzed the current situation and the active thoughts of the cadre with the young cadres beforehand, studied the outline of the mobilization report together, and encouraged the young cadres to boldly and vigorously carry out their work. The military cadres also helped the revolutionary young cadres continuously summarize their experiences, continuously improving the young cadres' policy level and leadership capabilities.

Politically demanding the revolutionary new cadres

The military leaders paid great attention to the active thoughts of the revolutionary young cadres, politically demanding the revolutionary new cadres. Among the standing committee members of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, several were originally leaders of city-wide revolutionary mass organizations. Sometimes when the Revolutionary Committee discussed issues, some young cadres would consciously or unconsciously favor their own organizations. The military leaders believed that this was the small-bourgeois factionalism at work. They helped the revolutionary young cadres study Chairman Mao's teachings on "acting in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups," had heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary young cadres, helped them clarify the issue of for whom to hold power and for whom to use power, and continuously overcame the young cadres' various non-proletarian thoughts.

When the revolutionary new cadres made mistakes or had shortcomings, the military leaders adopted a serious yet warm attitude to help them. In May and June of this year, Qingdao experienced a period of intense class struggle. In this sharp and complex struggle, some young cadres lost their vigilance and direction, and their thoughts wavered. The military leaders took this issue seriously. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correcting erroneous thoughts with the young cadres who made mistakes, helped the young cadres analyze the causes of their mistakes, guided the young cadres to deeply excavate the root causes of their mistakes, and encouraged them to go to the workers and peasants more often, continuously transforming their worldview in the process of combining with the workers and peasants.

Setting an example, leading a revolutionary cadre

The several military leaders participating in the Municipal Revolutionary Committee are all old comrades who have followed the great leader Chairman Mao in battles across the country for decades. After participating in the Municipal Revolutionary Committee, these comrades continued to maintain and carry forward the fine tradition of modesty and prudence. They said: Our revolutionary history is longer than that of the young cadres, but the history of participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is much earlier for the young cadres. The young cadres understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line deeply, have the least conservative thoughts, and are our best teachers. The military leaders always used Chairman Mao's teachings of "not relying on old merits" and "to establish new merits and new labor" to strictly demand of themselves, setting a good example for the revolutionary new cadres.

The Municipal Revolutionary Committee stipulated that every Saturday is the time for cadres to participate in production labor. No matter how busy the military leaders were, they never missed the opportunity to participate in labor. In July of this year, the comrades of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee went to the dock to participate in labor. The military leaders were like they were back on the battlefield, pulling carts and carrying bags of fertilizer with the dock workers. Under the influence of the veterans, the young cadres also actively and voluntarily participated in production labor. On October 12, inspired by Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the Qingdao Municipal Revolutionary Committee decided to send two-thirds of the standing committee members to the masses to learn from them. The military leaders were the first to sign up, pack their bags, and go to the grassroots level that day.

The military leaders often reminded the revolutionary young cadres to guard against the attack of sugar-coated bullets. They encouraged the revolutionary new cadres to stand aside in several situations: standing aside from seeking fame, standing aside from honors, and standing aside from watching plays and movies. They said: The hole is small, but the wind is big. These seemingly trivial matters of life are actually big political issues. If one is not careful, one will be dragged down by bourgeois ideology.

The power of example is boundless. The military leaders set an example in everything, greatly educating the revolutionary new cadres. Many revolutionary new cadres repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Because of victory, arrogance, the attitude of regarding oneself as a hero, the attitude of stopping progress and not seeking progress, the attitude of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life may grow within the party. Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery, however, may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." They took Chairman Mao's teachings as their "motto," took revolutionary predecessors as their examples, and were determined to transform themselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    老将们的革命责任
    ——参加青岛市革命委员会的部队干部热情帮助革命新干部锻炼成长
    无产阶级文化大革命的激流，把一大批革命的“小人物”推上了革命的领导岗位，进入了革命三结合的领导班子。
  青岛市革命委员会半数以上的常委、大部分委员，都是从革命群众中选拔上来的二、三十岁的年轻人，有的是革命工人，有的是革命学生，有的是没做过领导工作的一般干部。
    今年一月下旬，青岛市无产阶级革命派夺权胜利不久，人民解放军驻青岛部队立即派出五名具有丰富的阶级斗争经验的主要领导干部参加了青岛市革命三结合的临时权力机构。他们虚心地向革命的新干部学习，又把带好这个班子看成是自己义不容辞的革命责任，看成是捍卫毛主席革命路线的实际行动。
    把“跟上靠下”的经验传给小将
    青岛市夺权胜利初期的一段时间，市革命委员会的工作非常忙碌。在这种情况下，有的委员坐不下来了，对毛主席著作的学习有些放松。部队领导干部觉得这是十分危险的倾向，必须帮助革命小将树立起“跟上靠下”的坚强信念。跟上，就是紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，坚持活学活用毛主席著作。靠下，就是依靠广大无产阶级革命派，遇事多和群众商量，甘当群众的小学生。部队领导干部在市革命委员会反复强调学习毛主席著作的重要性，并从那时起，开始把部队“天天读”的制度带到了革命委员会。革命委员会的成员每天抽出一小时学习毛主席著作；每个星期还安排两个半天，作为集体学习时间，在这个时间里，老将同小将一起亮思想，斗私心，检查工作中是否有违背毛主席教导的现象，随时发现，随时纠正。
    部队领导干部还经常对革命小将进行群众路线的教育，帮助革命小将牢固地树立起群众观点。特别是毛主席的最新指示传达以后，驻军政委、市革委会主要负责人陈继德同志和革命小将一起深入到全市各条战线，进行深入细致的调查研究工作。
        尊重革命小将的首创精神
    青岛市革命委员会中的革命小将，都是从资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中冲杀出来的无产阶级革命派，他们无限忠于毛主席，敢想、敢说、敢做、敢闯、敢革命，对于新鲜事物有锐敏的感觉，有高度的热情和积极性。
    为了在革命三结合的领导班子中充分发挥革命小将敢想、敢干的长处，部队领导干部对革命的新干部的使用大胆放手。在多数场合，都是鼓励革命小将“打头阵”，自己作小将的坚强后盾和“参谋”。有一次，青岛市革命委员会召开机关干部深入第一线参加大批判的动员大会，革命小将觉得这个会很重要，牵涉到全市机关革命化问题，想请部队领导干部作动员报告。部队领导干部认为还是让小将作比较好，多见一次世面，就会多受一次锻炼。他们事先同小将一起分析当前形势和机关干部的活思想，一起研究动员报告的提纲，鼓励小将大胆泼辣地开展工作。部队干部还通过帮助革命小将不断总结经验，不断提高小将的政策水平和领导能力。
    从政治上严格要求革命的新干部
    部队领导干部十分注意抓革命小将的活思想，从政治上严格要求革命的新干部。在市革命委员会常委中间，有几个常委原来是几个全市性革命群众组织的负责人。有时革命委员会讨论问题，有个别小将总是自觉与不自觉地偏袒自己的组织，部队领导干部认为这是小资产阶级派性在作怪。于是就帮助革命小将学习毛主席“一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”的教导，同革命小将促膝谈心，帮助他们明确为谁掌权、为谁用权的问题，使小将的各种非无产阶级思想不断得到克服。
    革命的新干部有了缺点、错误，部队领导干部采取既严肃，又热情的态度给以帮助。今年五六月间，青岛市有一段时期阶级斗争非常激烈，在这场尖锐复杂的斗争风浪里，有个别小将失去了警惕，迷失了方向，思想上有些摇摆。部队领导干部严肃地对待这一问题。他们同犯错误的革命小将一起学习毛主席关于纠正错误思想的教导，帮助小将分析犯错误的原因，引导小将深挖犯错误的思想根源，鼓励他们多到工农群众中去，在同工农群众相结合的过程中，不断改造世界观。
    以身作则，带出一个革命化的领导班子
    参加市革命委员会的几位部队领导干部，都是跟随伟大领袖毛主席南征北战几十年的老同志。这些同志参加市革命委员会以后，继续保持和发扬了谦虚谨慎的优良传统。他们说：参加革命的历史，我们比小将长，但是参加无产阶级文化大革命的历史，小将比我们早得多。小将们对毛主席的革命路线理解得深，最少保守思想，是我们最好的老师。部队领导干部时时刻刻用毛主席的“不能靠吃老本”，“要立新功，立新劳”的教导，处处严格要求自己，给革命的新干部作出了良好的榜样。
    市革命委员会规定每星期六是干部参加生产劳动的时间，部队领导干部不管工作多么忙，从来也不耽误参加劳动的机会。今年七月，市革委会的同志到码头参加劳动。部队领导干部又象回到了战场上一样，同码头工人一起拉车、扛化肥袋。在老将的带动下，小将们也积极主动地参加生产劳动。十月十二日，在毛主席最新指示的鼓舞下，青岛市革委会决定抽出三分之二的常委到群众中去，向群众学习，部队领导干部又是首先报名，背起行李当天就下到基层。
    部队领导干部经常提醒革命小将要防止糖衣炮弹的袭击。他们勉励革命的新干部，要做到几个“靠边站”：出风头的事，靠边站；荣誉面前，靠边站；看戏看电影，靠边站。他们说：洞小风大。这些看起来是生活琐事，其实是政治大事，不注意，就会被资产阶级思想拖下水。
    榜样的力量是无穷的。部队领导干部处处以身作则，对革命的新干部教育很大。许多革命的新干部反复学习毛主席的教导：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”他们把毛主席这一教导作为“座右铭”，以革命前辈为榜样，决心把自己改造成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠的接班人。　（新华社稿，本报有删节）
