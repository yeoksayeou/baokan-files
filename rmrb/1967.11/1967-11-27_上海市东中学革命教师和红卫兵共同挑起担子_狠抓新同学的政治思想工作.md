Revolutionary teachers and high school students who are Red Guards at Shanghai Dongzhong School have taken on the responsibility of strengthening political ideological work among new students. They are enhancing the students' revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, ensuring that the campaign to resume classes and make revolution can proceed smoothly.

This school's new students have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and have a strong revolutionary spirit. However, some of them have been influenced by anarchist tendencies in society and lack organizational discipline. Initially, many teachers felt "difficult" and "afraid" when dealing with these new students. Through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and through self-criticism and criticism of revisionism, the teachers realized that they must use a dialectical approach to view the new students, focusing on the main aspects and the essence. Regarding the students' shortcomings, revolutionary teachers have the responsibility to help them overcome these issues and guide them onto the path of proletarian revolution. This idea was supported by the senior Red Guards. The Red Guards said that they also have a responsibility in the political ideological education of young people. After discussion, it was decided that each new student class would be assigned two teachers and two senior Red Guard students as counselors to jointly research how to conduct political ideological education for young people. Based on the specific situation of the new students, they focused on the following four aspects:

(1) Before the start of the school year, revolutionary teachers and Red Guard students together visited the primary schools where the new students came from to hold discussions with revolutionary teachers, understanding the students' participation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

(2) After the start of the school year, they emphasized political ideological education, organizing the students to study Chairman Mao's teachings on the five conditions for being a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause and his latest directives on the educational revolution. The counselors and the students discussed what is revolutionary rebel spirit and what is anarchism, and they also conducted military training activities.

(3) They emphasized education on the current situation, guiding the students to pay attention to national affairs and participate in the educational revolution. Some classes also conducted class education based on specific circumstances.

(4) Each class held study sessions on Mao Zedong Thought, studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Three Articles" and "Against Liberalism," raising awareness, strengthening revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, and overcoming anarchist tendencies.

Currently, eight classes can basically maintain three classes in the morning and part of the students participate in Mao Zedong Thought study sessions in the afternoon. Many new students have written big-character posters for revolutionary criticism.

    上海市东中学革命教师和红卫兵共同挑起担子
    狠抓新同学的政治思想工作
    据新华社上海二十六日电　上海市市东中学革命教师和高年级的红卫兵革命小将，狠抓新同学的政治思想教育工作，加强他们的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，使复课闹革命能够比较正常地开展起来。
    这所学校这次招收的新生，无限热爱毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，革命精神强。他们当中也有一些人受到社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，组织纪律性比较差。对这届新生，开始时不少教师产生了“难”、“怕”的思想。通过活学活用毛主席著作，斗私批修，教师们认识到必须用一分为二的观点来看新同学，要看主流，看本质。对于他们的缺点，革命教师有责任帮助他们克服，把他们引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。他们的想法得到了高年级红卫兵小将的支持。红卫兵小将说，搞好青少年政治思想教育工作，我们也有责任。经过研究，决定每个新生班级配备两个教师、两个高年级的红卫兵革命小将担任辅导员，一起研究如何搞好青少年的政治思想教育工作。根据新生的具体情况，他们着重做了以下四个方面的工作：
    （一）开学前，革命教师和红卫兵革命小将一起到新生原在的小学找革命教师开座谈会，了解学生参加文化大革命运动的情况。（二）开学后狠抓政治思想教育，组织他们学习毛主席关于无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件的教导，学习毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示。辅导员和他们一起讨论了什么是革命造反精神，什么是无政府主义，并开展了军训活动。（三）大抓形势教育，引导学生关心国家大事，投身教育革命，有的班级还结合具体情况进行了阶级教育。（四）各个班级举办毛泽东思想学习班，学习毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”和《反对自由主义》，提高觉悟，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，克服无政府主义倾向。
    现在，八个班级基本上能坚持每天上午上三节课，下午部分同学参加毛泽东思想学习班学习。不少新同学写了革命大批判的大字报。
