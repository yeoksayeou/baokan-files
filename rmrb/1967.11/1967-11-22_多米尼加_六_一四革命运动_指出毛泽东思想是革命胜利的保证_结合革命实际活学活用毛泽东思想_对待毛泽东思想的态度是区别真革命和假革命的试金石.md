The "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" in the Dominican Republic highly praises Mao Zedong Thought and is actively learning and applying it in conjunction with the revolutionary realities of the Dominican Republic.

A leader of the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the contemporary Marxism-Leninism, a powerful weapon for the peoples of all countries in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism. The attitude towards learning, mastering, and applying Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone to distinguish true revolutionaries from false ones. To build a Marxist-Leninist party and to become a genuine Marxist-Leninist, one must learn Mao Zedong Thought."

He said, Chairman Mao, in summing up the experience of the Chinese revolution, pointed out the "three magic weapons" which are completely applicable to Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The experience of these regions has proven that to achieve revolutionary victory, there must be leadership by a Marxist-Leninist party, there must be people's war, and there must be a policy of both uniting with and struggling against the national bourgeoisie. He said, in the Dominican Republic, due to the lack of a party built, developed, and consolidated on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, many setbacks and failures have been encountered in the struggle. And a revolutionary party, to achieve Bolshevization, to lead the people's war and to formulate correct policies, cannot do without Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the sole guarantee for the revolutionary victory of the Dominican people.

Members of the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" pointed out that, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and their own personal experience, they have come to realize: in the Dominican Republic, the peasants are the main force of the revolution and the most steadfast allies of the working class. Without the participation of the peasants, the revolution cannot achieve victory. Based on this understanding, the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" has dispatched its outstanding cadres to the countryside. They conduct social investigations using class analysis, rely on poor peasants and farm workers, educate the peasants with the thought of people's war and the principle of self-reliance, and lead the peasants in land struggles.

Under the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" recently launched a movement of criticism and self-criticism from the bottom up. Members of this organization pointed out that the purpose of this movement is to eliminate bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology, to remove the influence of revisionism and right opportunism, especially to eliminate some erroneous views on armed struggle prevalent in Latin America, so as to prepare for armed struggle under the guidance of correct ideology. In this movement, they use Mao Zedong Thought, recommending to members Chairman Mao's four philosophical works and the brilliant works "On the New Democracy," "On Protracted War," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," and "Reform Our Study."

Members of the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" said that it is necessary to strengthen the study of Chairman Mao's works, to study with questions in mind, to apply them in practice, and to make them into weapons for combat. He said, to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" has published in its newspaper quotations from Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao's articles "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "On Protracted War," and articles introducing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

    多米尼加“六·一四革命运动”指出毛泽东思想是革命胜利的保证
    结合革命实际活学活用毛泽东思想
    对待毛泽东思想的态度是区别真革命和假革命的试金石
    新华社讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加进步组织“六月十四日革命运动”高度评价毛泽东思想，并且正在结合多米尼加的革命实际，积极学习和运用毛泽东思想。
    “六月十四日革命运动”的一位领导人说：“毛泽东思想是当代的马克思列宁主义，是各国人民进行反帝、反修斗争的强大武器。对待学习、掌握和运用毛泽东思想的态度，是区别真革命和假革命的试金石。要建设马克思列宁主义的党，要成为真正的马克思列宁主义者，就必须学习毛泽东思想。”
    他说，毛主席在总结中国革命经验时指出的“三大法宝”完全适用于亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。这些地区的经验证明，要取得革命胜利，必须有马克思列宁主义政党的领导，必须进行人民战争，必须对民族资产阶级采取又团结又斗争的政策。他说，在多米尼加，由于缺少一个根据马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想建设、发展和巩固的党，因此在斗争中遭到许多挫折和失败。而一个革命党要实现布尔什维克化，要领导人民战争和制订正确的政策，都离不开毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是引导多米尼加人民革命取得胜利的唯一保证。
    “六月十四日革命运动”的成员指出，由于毛泽东思想的教导和他们自己的切身经验，他们认识到：在多米尼加，农民是革命的主力军和工人阶级最坚定的同盟者，没有农民的参加，革命就不可能取得胜利。基于这一认识，“六月十四日革命运动”派遣自己的优秀干部去农村，他们用阶级分析进行社会调查，依靠贫苦农民和农业工人，用人民战争思想和自力更生原则教育农民，并且领导农民进行夺地斗争。
    在中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响下，“六月十四日革命运动”最近开展了自下而上的批评和自我批评运动。这个组织的成员指出，这一运动的目的是破除资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，清除修正主义和右倾机会主义的影响，特别是清除在武装斗争问题上在拉丁美洲流行的一些错误观点，以便在正确思想的指导下准备开展武装斗争。他们在这个运动中运用毛泽东思想，向成员推荐毛主席的四篇哲学著作和《〈共产党人〉发刊词》、《论持久战》、《整顿党的作风》、《改造我们的学习》等光辉著作。
    “六月十四日革命运动”的成员说，必须加强毛主席著作的学习，要带着问题学，在实践中运用，使之成为战斗的武器。他说，为了宣传毛泽东思想，“六月十四日革命运动”在自己的报纸上刊登了毛主席语录、毛主席的《为人民服务》、《抗日游击战争的战略问题》等文章，还发表了介绍中国无产阶级文化大革命的文章。
