    Military and civilians work closely together to launch fierce attacks, dealing a heavy blow to the American puppet forces

    South Vietnam's Central Southern Region military and civilians achieved a significant victory in October by proactively attacking the enemy, killing over 5,500 enemy forces, including 800 American invaders.

    The report states that among the enemy forces eliminated were three entire enemy battalions (one American artillery battalion, one puppet army main force battalion, and one special forces battalion), four companies, six platoons, three "pacification teams," one division headquarters, and one regiment headquarters. Additionally, one puppet army main force battalion and one special forces battalion were severely damaged. This is the month with the highest number of enemy units eliminated in this region since the beginning of the year.

    The People's Liberation Armed Forces also destroyed 44 enemy outposts, guard posts, and one military sub-district, destroyed or damaged 87 military vehicles, shot down or destroyed 21 aircraft, sank or damaged 25 ships, destroyed 21 artillery pieces, and burned down numerous enemy barracks and warehouses.

    The report mentions that in this month's battles, the most outstanding achievement was the People's Liberation Armed Forces launching fierce attacks on nearly 20 cities, towns, counties, and airfields, killing over 1,500 enemy forces. In the attack on Chu Duc City, the Liberation Forces destroyed the Chu Duc Military Sub-district and enemy headquarters, killing 200 enemy forces in one go. Particularly, the military and civilians of Ninh Thuan Province launched a series of attacks on 11 enemy outposts along the Route 4 highway, completely annihilating an American artillery battalion and the 25th Division of the puppet army, severely damaging four enemy companies and one "pacification team," killing, wounding, and capturing 850 enemy forces, destroying 12 artillery pieces, and 44 military vehicles.

    To support the armed struggle, tens of thousands of people in the Central Southern Region have risen up to demolish "strategic hamlets," sabotage roads, surround enemy outposts, punish traitors, and expand liberated areas.

    According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 16th, the military and civilians of Ninh Thuan and Tien Giang Provinces engaged in 102 battles with the enemy in October, killing over 1,900 enemy forces, including 495 American soldiers. They completely annihilated an American artillery battalion, a puppet army battalion, and five companies of American and puppet forces. Under the heavy blows of the People's Liberation Armed Forces, the puppet army was in a state of panic and low morale. In this month, 430 puppet soldiers deserted.

    The military and civilians of Tien Giang Province also destroyed and captured one enemy artillery position and three outposts, blew up ammunition depots, fuel depots, and 54 military warehouses, destroyed 18 artillery pieces of various calibers, destroyed or damaged 64 armored vehicles and other military vehicles, shot down 13 aircraft, and damaged two military ships.
