We heard the central People's Radio Station broadcast the latest directive from our most beloved and respected great leader, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, on the proletarian educational revolution. The entire school of revolutionary teachers and students was thrilled, cheering and jumping with joy, tears of excitement welling up in our eyes, shouting "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years of long life to Chairman Mao!" The teachers and students of the "May 7th" Commune, who are implementing the educational reform plan on the construction site, were even more elated and rushed to the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee to report the good news in the middle of the night.

The Revolutionary Committee of the school convened an expanded meeting of the standing committee in the middle of the night to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest directive and to discuss measures to implement the latest directive. We decided to take the fastest action to mobilize the masses to carry out the educational revolution and strive to make Tongji University a true "May 7th" Commune that shines with the glory of the "May 7th" Directive.

Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive is the supreme guideline for our proletarian educational revolution. The practice of educational revolution in our school over the past few months has proven that implementing Chairman Mao's "May 7th" Directive and carrying out the proletarian educational revolution is a very serious struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Therefore, we must mobilize the masses, rely on the steadfast proletarian revolutionary faction, rely on revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers. The bold vision for educational reform in our school was proposed by them, especially by those among them who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end; it was proposed by them in the process of eating, living, and working with worker comrades.

The educational revolution is also a sharp struggle between two worldviews, and it inevitably deeply touches the soul of each person. As the Cultural Revolution deepens, some people may retreat, and various non-proletarian thoughts will emerge. When we tried to implement educational reform in the "May 7th" Commune, there were also people who expressed opposition. Some bourgeois intellectuals even mocked us, saying, "You are trying to eat swan meat with a poor specialty," "You are rebelling just to find a way out for yourselves!" Some even said, "If you cultivate university students like your 'May 7th' Commune, they will not be as good as a small apprentice." In the face of such slander, some comrades in the "May 7th" Commune also wavered. However, the majority of comrades were very firm. They said, "We are the children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, and we are the youth of the Mao Zedong era. We must complete the glorious task of educational revolution entrusted to us by Chairman Mao." Under the guidance of the brilliant thoughts of Chairman Mao's "Old Five Articles" and the "May 7th" Directive, the comrades in the "May 7th" Commune persevered!

"The natural cave is a fairy cave, and the infinite scenery is on the dangerous peak." The proletarian educational revolution is a heavy task with a long way to go. All revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers of Tongji University solemnly pledge to Chairman Mao: In the great waves of educational revolution, we will definitely take your latest directive as our guide, take "Fight Selfishness and Criticize Revisionism" as the key, and strive to establish a brand-new proletarian educational system!

    “五·七”指示是教育革命的最高纲领
    上海同济大学革命委员会
    我们听到中央人民广播电台传出了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席关于无产阶级教育革命的最新指示，全校革命师生群情振奋，欢呼跳跃，含着满眶激动的热泪，千遍万遍地高呼毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！按照教改方案正在建筑工地进行教学改革的“五·七”公社部分师生，更是欢欣鼓舞，深夜赶到上海市革命委员会报喜。
    校革命委员会连夜召开常委扩大会议，认真学习了毛主席最新指示，并且研究了如何贯彻最新指示的措施。我们决定以最迅速的行动，放手发动群众进行教育革命，争取把同济大学办成真正闪耀“五·七”指示光辉的“五·七”公社。
    毛主席的“五·七”指示是我们进行无产阶级教育革命的最高纲领。我校几个月来的教育革命实践证明，贯彻毛主席的“五·七”指示，进行无产阶级教育革命是一场极其严重的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，因此必须放手发动群众，依靠坚定的无产阶级革命派，依靠革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人。我校教育改革的大胆设想就是依靠他们，特别是依靠他们中间决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，经过长期的多次实地调查提出来的；是他们在和工人同志同吃、同住、同劳动的过程中提出来的。
    教育革命也是两种世界观的尖锐斗争，它必然深刻地触及每个人的灵魂。当文化大革命更深入地展开的时候，有些人就可能落荒退伍，各种非无产阶级思想也会跑了出来。在我们“五·七”公社进行教育改革尝试的时候，也曾有人表示反对。有的资产阶级知识分子甚至讽刺我们“是蹩脚专业想吃天鹅肉”、“是为了自己找出路才造反”！有人甚至说：“象你们‘五·七’公社这样培养大学生，出来比不上一个小小的艺徒。”在这种种诽谤面前，“五·七”公社中的个别同志也动摇了。但是，绝大多数的同志都很坚定。他们说，我们是工人、贫下中农的儿女，是毛泽东时代的青年，一定要完成毛主席交给我们的教育革命的光荣任务。在毛主席的“老五篇”和“五·七”指示光辉思想的指引下，“五·七”公社的同志们坚定地坚持下来了！
    “天生一个仙人洞，无限风光在险峰。”无产阶级教育革命任重而道远，我们同济大学全体革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人向毛主席宣誓：在教育革命的大风大浪中，我们一定以您老人家的最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，为建立崭新的无产阶级教育制度而奋斗到底！
