The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses on the industrial front in Harbin have earnestly carried out Chairman Mao's great call to "save and make revolution." They have achieved new successes in saving coal. Preliminary statistics show that the industrial front in the city saved more than 42,000 tons of coal from January to October.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses on the industrial front in Harbin fully understand that coal is the grain of industry. Saving coal not only has great economic significance but also great political significance. Many workers in the power departments of various factories have actively carried out technical renovations of boilers, improved combustion methods, and used every means to tap the potential for saving coal. At present, 75 percent of the industrial boilers in the city have undergone technical renovations. The coal-saving effect of the renovated boilers is remarkable, generally saving 20 percent of coal compared to before, with the highest saving up to 60 percent. The machinery industry system in Harbin has, since this year, organized more than 200 boiler operators to attend training classes and study Chairman Mao's works actively. While studying, they have combined the situation of their own units to research and improve boiler technology. At present, the 27 boilers that have been renovated in the machinery industry system not only save a lot of coal but also can reduce the need for more than 40 boiler operators.

    哈尔滨工业战线千方百计节约煤炭
    全市一到十月总共节约煤炭四万二千多吨
    据新华社哈尔滨电　哈尔滨市工业战线广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，认真贯彻毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，在节约煤炭方面做出了新成绩。据初步统计，全市工业战线一到十月总共节约煤炭四万二千多吨。
    哈尔滨市工业战线广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，充分认识到煤炭是工业的粮食，节约煤炭不仅具有重大的经济意义，而且具有重大的政治意义。许多工厂动力部门的革命职工，积极进行锅炉技术改造，改进燃烧方法，千方百计挖掘节煤潜力。目前，全市工业系统已经进行技术改造的锅炉占工业锅炉总数的百分之七十五。经过改造的锅炉，节煤效果显著，一般比原来节约煤炭百分之二十左右，最高的达到百分之六十。哈尔滨市机械工业系统，今年以来先后组织了二百多名司炉工人参加训练班，活学活用毛主席著作。他们一边学习，一边结合本单位情况，研究改进锅炉技术。目前，机械工业系统经过改造的二十七台锅炉，不仅大大节约了煤炭，而且还可以少用四十余名司炉工人。
