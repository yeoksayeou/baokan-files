Just as the hundreds of millions of revolutionary teachers and students across the nation respond to the call from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to resume classes and carry out revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education, our great leader Chairman Mao has issued new directives on the educational revolution, pointing out the direction for our advance.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You are forever in our hearts. Your new directives are the greatest concern, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest support for us! All the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of China Medical University are determined to carry out the educational revolution to the end under the guidance of your brilliant thoughts.

China Medical University was established on the basis of the old Peking Union Medical College, a product of the revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev. It is a typical example of an aristocratic school nurtured by the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen and Lu Dingyi, who used the old "Peking Union" framework to fully copy the entire educational system, teaching principles, and methods of the cultural invasion stronghold of American imperialism—the old "Peking Union." The old "Peking Union" had an eight-year system, and so did it; the old "Peking Union" had a three-year preparatory class, and so did it. The school system was unusually long, the courses unusually numerous, and the students' burden unusually heavy, yet some counter-revolutionary revisionists praised it as "high quality" and "Peking Union standard."

Under the control of the revisionist educational line, workers' and peasants' children and revolutionary cadres were discriminated against and suppressed. Many young people were poisoned here. Some students were engrossed in their work, pursuing personal fame and gain. Some students completely bowed down to celebrities, foreigners, and the dead...

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools must not be allowed to continue." We, the revolutionary teachers and students of the medical university, hate the revisionist educational system to the core. We are determined to carry out a thorough revolution in our school, taking Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao recently taught us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the active elements among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Chairman Mao's new directive solves the fundamental issue of the proletarian educational revolution, that is, the issue of who the educational revolution relies on. By following Chairman Mao's new directive, we can thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools and create a brand-new proletarian educational system.

The preliminary plans for educational revolution proposed by Tongji University and other three institutions have given us many inspirations. We are now, according to Chairman Mao's new directive, mobilizing the masses extensively and, referring to these plans, studying the plans for the medical educational revolution. We are determined to blaze a new trail in medical education that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought!

    学制要缩短，教育要革命
    中国医科大学革命委员会
    正当全国亿万革命师生响应毛主席、党中央关于大、中、小学复课闹革命的号召，投入一场新的战斗的时候，伟大领袖毛主席发出了关于教育革命的最新指示，给我们指明了前进的方向。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您永远和我们心连心。您的最新指示是对我们的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持！我们中国医科大学全体革命师生员工决心在您的光辉思想指引下，把教育革命进行到底。
    中国医科大学，是在旧协和医学院的基础上办起来的，是中国的赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的产物，是反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一利用旧“协和”的班底，亲手培植起来的一个贵族化学校的典型。他们在中国医科大学这个新招牌的掩护下，肆无忌惮地全面地抄袭了美帝国主义文化侵略堡垒——旧“协和”的整套教育制度、教学方针和方法。旧“协和”是八年制，它也办八年制；旧“协和”有三年预科班，它也办三年预科班。学制出奇的长，课程出奇的多，学生的负担出奇的重，而一些反革命修正主义分子却把它吹嘘为“高质量”，“协和标准”。
    在修正主义教育路线的控制下，工农子女、革命干部遭受排挤和打击。许多青年在这里受到了毒害。有的学生埋头业务，追求个人名利。有的学生完全拜倒在名人、洋人和死人的脚下……。
    毛主席教导我们：“学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”我们医科大学的革命师生恨透了修正主义的教育制度，我们决心以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高指针，在我们学校里来一个彻底革命。
    最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席这个最新指示，解决了无产阶级教育革命的根本道路问题，即教育革命究竟依靠谁的问题。按照毛主席的最新指示办事，才能彻底结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，创造出崭新的无产阶级教育制度。
    同济大学等三所院校提出的教育革命初步方案，给了我们许多启发。我们正按照毛主席的最新指示，广泛发动群众，参照这些方案，研究医学教育革命的方案。我们决心闯出一条闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的医学教育的新道路！
