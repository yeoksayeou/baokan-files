The clay sculpture exhibition "The Family History of an Air Force Soldier" is part of the art exhibition "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" and has been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers since its display in the capital. The exhibition features eight groups of sculptures, totaling twenty-five figures. These sculptures vividly depict the sufferings of the laboring masses under the old society, praise their revolutionary spirit of taking up arms to rebel under the leadership of the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and expose the brutality of the class enemies. They refute the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "exploitation is beneficial" and "workers and peasants welcome exploitation," thereby providing a profound class education to the broad audience. A comrade from our unit, after viewing the exhibition, was so moved that he shed tears. He said, "This is a vivid class struggle education course. It makes us remember the hardships of the old society and increases our love for the new society."

Why can these ordinary clay sculptures have such a profound educational impact? This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. These sculptures not only educate the audience but also educate us. Below, we will share some of our reflections from the creation process.

Workers, peasants, and soldiers must occupy the art front

Our great leader Chairman Mao taught us twenty-five years ago: "Our literature and art are for the people, for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and are created for them and used by them." However, the handful of capitalists within the Party have done everything possible to resist the instructions of our great leader, allowing emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties to dominate the artistic stage. For a long time, the field of sculpture has also been controlled by a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. They use this art form to actively create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We soldiers are indignant about this phenomenon and have long wanted to smash the artistic stage controlled by ghosts and snakes, allowing the true masters of history—workers, peasants, and soldiers—to occupy all cultural fronts. The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, has overturned the handful of capitalists within the Party and the counter-revolutionary revisionist literary and artistic line. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have begun to ascend to the socialist artistic stage with a heroic posture. Under this situation, in May of this year, the unit decided to hold a class education exhibition. The Party committee required us to use clay sculptures to vividly present the family histories of six deeply resentful pilots and soldiers, thereby conducting class education for the unit. With this arduous task, we came to Beijing to learn from professional sculptors who created the clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard." However, after visiting the "Rent Collection Courtyard" clay sculpture exhibition, some comrades frowned and said, "Such large clay figures and such complex techniques, can we, who do not know how to draw or understand art, do this?" Others said, "We can assist the professional workers, mix the clay, and let them sculpt a few figures for us." In short, everyone's confidence was insufficient. In response to these active thoughts, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" and the "Minutes of the Symposium on Military Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing." Through our study, we further understood that the central issue of the struggle between the two classes and two lines on the literary and artistic front is the issue of for whom literature and art serve, which is the issue of the proletariat seizing power on the literary and artistic front. Therefore, our creation of clay sculptures is not just about molding a few clay figures; it is essentially a struggle for seizing power. The literary and artistic front, if the proletariat does not occupy it, the bourgeoisie will. The revolutionary literary and artistic front, we workers, peasants, and soldiers, will definitely occupy it!

No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing is difficult

When we began our creation, we encountered this problem: should we follow the path of the bourgeois "experts," or should we take our own path? Once, a sculptor recounted his personal suffering and denounced the crimes of the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the bourgeois "experts" and "authorities." He said that in the past, when studying sculpture, he first read books and never touched the actual work. After six years of study, he was still not as skilled as practicing for a few months. Hearing this sculptor's account, we were greatly shocked. We decided to smash the old frameworks of the bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities" and forge our own path in clay sculpture art. But we are ordinary soldiers, with low cultural levels, unable to draw or sculpt. How can we forge ahead? Comrade Lin Biao taught us: "With the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, this most sharp weapon, we can be invincible, conquer all, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" In the creation process, we firmly believed: no matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, nothing is difficult!

We did not know, we did not understand, but we followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning war from war" and learned from revolutionary sculptors in actual work. Not knowing anatomy, we could not build the framework, so we measured and built it according to our own bodies; not knowing the structure of bones, we used photographs as models and groped our way bit by bit; not knowing the structure of muscles, we sculpted according to our own muscles. In this way, we overcame numerous difficulties and, after three months of effort, finally created eight groups of clay sculptures: "Begging for Food," "Forcing Rent," "Deceiving and Selling," "Being Harmed," "Being Drafted," and "Sending a Son to the Army." We deeply felt that the workers and soldiers, whom the counter-revolutionary revisionists and bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" scorned as "clumsy," can, when armed with Mao Zedong Thought, not only occupy the artistic stage but also completely break through the so-called "art frontier" and "art heavy industry" of sculpture, making sculpture truly serve proletarian politics and serve workers, peasants, and soldiers.

Singing praises for the revolutionary spirit of the laboring people's resistance

According to the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, we grasped three key points throughout the creation process: the laboring people's spirit of daring to struggle under the oppression of the three great mountains; where there is oppression, there is resistance; the laboring people's revolutionary struggle from individual resistance to the resistance of the entire class.

The first group of sculptures depicts the scene of Zhang Jinfu, the deputy squadron leader's mother, leading her young son Jinfu to beg for food. Initially, we considered several plans: some thought that since it was begging, we should depict the scene of begging from the landlord; others advocated depicting the scene of Jinfu and his mother being bitten by the landlord's dog. How should we depict it? With this question in mind, we studied Chairman Mao's works again. Chairman Mao said, "For revolutionary literary and artistic workers, the objects of exposure should only be the invaders, exploiters, oppressors, and the evil influences they leave behind in the people, and not the people themselves." We recalled the scene when we visited Zhang Jinfu's mother. The old woman told us, "The poor are oppressed by the landlords to the point of suffocation and have to flee and beg for food. But we poor people have dignity. At that time, Jinfu's father was so hungry that his stomach was pressed against his spine, but he would not beg from the landlord." The old woman became more and more indignant as she spoke, and spontaneously shouted the slogan of overthrowing the landlords. The strong class feelings of Jinfu's mother deeply infected us. With this feeling, we successfully created "Begging for Food": On a snowy New Year's Eve, Jinfu's mother stood in front of the landlord's gate, one hand stroking Jinfu, the other hand tightly gripping a stick to beat the dog, her eyes glaring at the landlord's gate, with hatred burning in her eyes; young Jinfu clung to his mother, glaring forward, and in his young heart, the seeds of hatred for the exploiting class were deeply planted. From these images, we tried to show the strong hatred of the oppressed and exploited peasants towards the landlord class, their unyielding spirit of resistance in the face of poverty, and their inevitable launch of a large-scale revolutionary struggle like a storm, completely smashing the landlord's hell.

The Chinese Khrushchev absurdly claims that workers and peasants "are afraid of not being exploited," and that landlords and capitalists "the more they exploit, the greater their merit." This is a slander and attack on the laboring people. When we created the family history of the armorer Zhao Liming, we first studied Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" and criticized the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, focusing on depicting the people's unwillingness to be humiliated and their courage to resist. Look, Zhao Liming's father, although seriously ill in bed, still struggled to get up, using his right hand to support his entire body, his eyes fixed on the dog landlord, and his left hand pointing at the landlord, seemingly wanting to tear the class enemy to pieces at once! Liming's second brother rushed forward without hesitation, grabbed the dog landlord's hand, and bit it fiercely, as if wanting to bite off that murderous claw with his mouth! This shows the lofty class qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants who dare to resist despite their strength.

Next, we created several more clay sculptures, forming a song of praise for the resistance and struggle of the oppressed class. However, all class struggles and armed struggles must achieve thorough victory, relying on the Party and the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. To highlight the armed struggle under the Party's leadership, we also created the seventh group of clay sculptures, "Sending a Son to the Army": the scene of Li Mingsheng, the deputy political commissar of the squadron, being sent to the army by his mother. Look, the squad leader hands Li Mingsheng a gun, indicating that "the whole world can only be changed with the gun." To make a revolution, one must take up the gun and follow Chairman Mao, Li Mingsheng looks at Chairman Mao's works, holding the gun tightly, as if swearing to Chairman Mao. Mingsheng's mother's eyes are fixed on Chairman Mao's book, and she places all her hopes on our most red sun, Chairman Mao. In this way, the people's gratitude and admiration for Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are fully expressed.

Chairman Mao taught us: "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised. This is the basic task of revolutionary literary and artistic workers." Throughout the clay sculpture creation process, we have always followed Chairman Mao's teachings, building monuments and biographies for the laboring people, and singing praises for the revolutionary spirit of resistance. Not only should we sing loudly today, but we should sing forever, generation after generation, until all imperialists and reactionaries who oppress and exploit the people are completely eliminated, until the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought shines over the entire world.

    为工农兵占领文艺阵地而冲锋陷阵
    ——参加《空军战士家史》泥塑创作的体会
    李红军　刘凤鸣　张玉林　龙有安　杨金福　孙洪江
    《空军战士家史》泥塑展览，作为《毛主席革命路线胜利万岁》美展的一个部分，在首都展出以来，受到了广大工农兵观众的热烈欢迎。这次展出的泥塑分为八组，共二十五个人物形象。由于它反映了旧社会劳动人民的苦难情景，歌颂了他们在党和伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，拿起枪杆子造反的革命精神，鞭笞了阶级敌人的残忍凶暴，用铁的事实驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“工人农民欢迎剥削”等反革命谬论，因而使广大观众受到了深刻的阶级教育。我们部队有位同志看后激动地流下了眼泪。他说：“这是一堂生动的阶级斗争教育课。它使我们重温了旧社会的苦，更增加了对新社会的爱。”
    几组普普通通的泥塑，为什么能产生这么大的教育作用呢？这是毛主席革命文艺路线的伟大胜利。这些泥塑不仅教育了观众，而且也教育了我们。下面就谈谈我们在创作过程中的几点体会。
    工农兵一定要占领美术阵地
    伟大的领袖毛主席早在二十五年前就教导我们说：“我们的文学艺术都是为人民大众的，首先是为工农兵的，为工农兵而创作，为工农兵所利用的。”但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派却千方百计地抗拒我们伟大领袖的指示，让帝王将相、才子佳人统治着艺术舞台。长期以来，雕塑这个阵地也一直掌握在一小撮反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”手里，他们利用这种艺术形式，积极为复辟资本主义制造舆论。对这种现象，我们解放军战士气愤万分，早就想把牛鬼蛇神所把持的文艺舞台砸个稀巴烂，让历史的主人——工农兵占领一切文艺阵地。伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的反，广大工农兵以豪迈的姿态，开始登上社会主义的艺术舞台。在这种形势下，今年五月，部队要搞阶级教育展览会，党委要求我们以泥塑形式，把六个苦大仇深的飞行员和战士的家史，形象地表现出来，对部队进行阶级教育。我们带着这个艰巨任务，来到北京，向创作泥塑《收租院》的专业雕塑工作者学习。但是，我们参观了《收租院》泥塑展览以后，有的同志便皱起眉头说：这么大的泥像，这么复杂的技巧，我们这些不会画、不懂艺术的人能行吗？也有的同志说：“我们给专业工作者打打下手，和和泥，让他们给咱塑几个泥像就行了”。总之，大家的信心是不足的。针对这些活思想，我们又反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》和《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》。通过学习，我们进一步认识到文艺战线上两个阶级、两条道路斗争的中心问题，就是文艺为谁服务的问题，也就是无产阶级在文艺战线上向资产阶级夺权斗争的问题。所以，我们搞泥塑创作，决不是单纯地捏几个泥人的问题，实质上也是一场夺权的斗争。文艺阵地，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就要去占领。革命的文艺阵地，我们工农兵是占定了！
    千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难
    当我们一进入创作的时候，就遇到这样一个问题：是照资产阶级“专家”的路子走呢？还是走工农兵自己的道路？有一次，一位雕塑工作者以自己亲身受到的毒害，控诉了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派以及资产阶级“专家”、“权威”的罪行。他说，以前学习雕塑，先啃书本，根本不接触实际，学了六年还不如在实践中锻炼个把月。听了这位雕塑工作者的控诉，使我们受到很大震动，我们决心砸烂资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”的旧框框，闯出一条工农兵自己掌握泥塑艺术的路子。可是我们都是普通的战士，文化水平不高，既不会画，又不会塑，怎么闯呢？林副主席教导我们说：“我们有毛主席的英明领导，掌握了毛泽东思想这个最锐利的武器，就能够所向披靡，攻无不克，取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！”在创作过程中，我们坚信：千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难！
    不会，不懂，我们遵照毛主席“从战争学习战争”的教导，在实际工作中向革命的雕塑工作者们学习。不懂解剖学，架子搭不起来，就照自己的身体边量边搭；不懂骨骼结构，就以照片作样子，一点一滴的摸索；不懂肌肉的结构，就照自己身上的肌肉塑造。就这样，我们克服了重重困难，经过三个月的努力，终于塑造出《逃荒要饭》《逼租》《骗卖》《被害》《抓伕》《送子参军》等八组泥塑。我们深深体会到：被反革命修正主义分子和资产阶级反动学术“权威”们斥责为“粗手笨脚”的工农兵战士，只要用毛泽东思想武装起来，不但可以占领文艺舞台，而且也完全可以攻破被称为“美术尖端”、“美术重工业”的雕塑堡垒，使雕塑真正为无产阶级政治服务，为工农兵服务。
    为劳动人民的革命反抗精神大唱颂歌
    根据我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，我们在整个创作过程中，紧紧抓住了三个要点：劳动人民在三座大山的压迫下敢于斗争的硬骨头精神；哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗；劳动人民的革命斗争由个人反抗到整个阶级的反抗。
    第一组塑像表现的是飞行大队副大队长张金秀同志的母亲，领着年幼的金秀讨饭的情景。开始时我们设想了几种方案：有人认为既然是讨饭，就表现伸手向地主去要的情景；也有人主张表现金秀母子遭地主家狗咬的惨景。究竟怎么表现呢？我们带着这个问题又学习了毛主席的著作。毛主席说：“对于革命的文艺家，暴露的对象，只能是侵略者、剥削者、压迫者及其在人民中所遗留的恶劣影响，而不能是人民大众。”我们再回忆走访张金秀同志的母亲时的情景，老人对我们说：“穷人被地主老财逼迫得喘不过气来，不得不逃荒要饭。可是咱穷人是有骨气的，那时是把仇恨记在心里。”又说：“当时金秀的父亲就是饿得肚皮贴着脊梁骨也不肯向地主讨饭。”老人越控诉越气愤，情不自禁地高呼打倒地主的口号。金秀母亲强烈的阶级感情，深深地感染着我们。怀着这种感情，我们顺利地创作了《逃荒要饭》：一个白雪纷飞的大年三十，金秀母亲在地主大门前，一手抚摸着金秀，一手紧握着打狗棍，两眼怒视地主老财家的大门，眼中闪射着仇恨的烈火，新仇旧恨一起涌上心头；年幼的金秀贴着母亲，怒视前方，在他幼小的心灵里，深深地埋下了对剥削阶级仇恨的种子。从这些形象中，我们企图显示出被压迫被剥削的农民对地主阶级的强烈仇恨，显示出农民在贫困面前含恨不屈的反抗精神，显示出他们必将掀起一场势如暴风骤雨的大规模的革命斗争，彻底把地主老财的阎王殿冲个粉碎。
    中国赫鲁晓夫胡说什么工人、农民“就是怕没有人剥削”，地主、资本家“剥削得越多，功劳越大”，这是对劳动人民的污蔑和攻击。我们塑造军械师赵立明的家史时，首先学习了毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，着重表现了人民不甘受辱，勇于反抗的革命精神。看，赵立明的父亲，虽然重病卧在床上，仍然不顾一切地挣扎起来，用右手支撑着全身，两眼死死盯住狗地主，又用左手指着地主，恨不得一下子把阶级敌人撕个粉碎。立明的二哥不顾一切地扑上前去，抓住狗地主的手就狠命地咬，似乎想用他的嘴咬断那杀人的魔爪！这就把贫下中农不畏强暴，敢于反抗的崇高的阶级品质显示出来了。
    接着，我们又创作了几组泥塑，连成了一首对被剥削阶级的反抗和斗争的颂歌。但是，一切阶级斗争和武装斗争要取得彻底胜利，都离不开党、离不开我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导。为了突出党领导下的武装斗争，我们又塑造了第七组泥塑《送子参军》：飞行大队副政委李明升的母亲送他参军的场面。看，指导员交给李明升一枝枪，表明“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”要革命，就拿起枪杆子跟毛主席走，李明升同志眼望毛主席著作，把枪握得紧紧的，好象在向毛主席宣誓。明升母亲的眼睛凝视着毛主席的书，她把自己一切希望都寄托在我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席身上。这样就把人民群众对毛主席、共产党的无限感激和爱戴之情，集中地表现了出来。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。”在整个泥塑创作过程中，我们自始至终遵照着毛主席的这一教导，为劳动人民树碑立传，为革命的反抗精神大唱颂歌。不仅今天要大唱特唱，而且要世世代代的永远唱下去，一直唱到世界上一切压迫人民、剥削人民的帝国主义和反动派全部被消灭，一直唱到光焰无际的毛泽东思想普照全世界。（附图片）
