The great tide of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is surging forward. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Zhejiang Province is as excellent as it is in the rest of the country, and it is getting better and better.

Not long ago, our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, traveled tirelessly to personally investigate the situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in Zhejiang Province. This is the greatest care, encouragement, support, and motivation for the 30 million people of Zhejiang and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Zhejiang. It is the greatest happiness for all the military and civilians in the province. We are filled with excitement and shout a thousand and ten thousand times: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long, long live!!!"

When Chairman Mao received us, he kindly instructed us: "When encountering matters, consult with the masses more and be a student of the masses." His great instructions will be forever unforgettable to us and will always be a great driving force for our progress.

Believe in the correctness of the masses, believe in the strength of the masses, believe in the future of the masses

"Only the people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." This is the fundamental attitude of the greatest proletarian revolutionary of our time, Chairman Mao, towards the masses. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is the most complete and thorough mass line that starts from the masses and ends with the masses. It most fully represents the revolutionary will and fundamental interests of the broad masses. With unparalleled wisdom and courage, Chairman Mao has mobilized hundreds of millions of people to carry out this unprecedented Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. This is the creative application and new development of the Marxist-Leninist mass line in the new stage of the socialist revolution. In this most extensive and profound revolutionary mass movement in human history, the attitude towards the masses has always been the focal point of the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. In this sense, the attitude towards the masses is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

The practice of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat has deeply educated us: the most fundamental thing in correctly treating the masses is the word "trust," that is, to believe in the correctness of the masses, to believe in the strength of the masses, and to believe in the future of the masses.

Believing in the correctness of the masses means believing that the broad revolutionary masses' direction of struggle is always correct. This is the primary issue of whether one can stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and correctly treat the masses in the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. In the past year and more of the Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province, the revolutionary rebels, represented by the Revolutionary Rebel Alliance of Zhejiang Province (hereinafter referred to as "Provincial Alliance"), have followed Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and always directed the spearhead of the struggle at China's Khrushchev and his agents in Zhejiang. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are terrified of the revolutionary mass movement and hate the revolutionary rebels to death. They have done their utmost to spread rumors and slander, calling the revolutionary masses' rebellion "the release of ghosts and snakes" and "the rightists' uprising." This is precisely the reactionary view that Chairman Mao has long criticized, which regards the peasant movement as a "hooligan movement" and a "lazy peasant movement."

The "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao points out: "The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres are the main force of this cultural revolution. ... In such a great revolutionary movement, they inevitably have this or that shortcoming, but their revolutionary direction is always correct." The broad revolutionary masses, fearless of violence and unafraid of attacks, with the great revolutionary spirit of "daring to be skinned alive and daring to pull the emperor off his horse," have fiercely opposed China's Khrushchev, the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. This shows that they are loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and reflects their strong desire to follow the socialist road. It is entirely justified to rebel, and it is very good! They are the backbone of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and they are the heroes who have destroyed the command center of the bourgeoisie. If we deny them, we deny the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat; if we suppress them, we suppress the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Indeed, some comrades in the revolutionary mass organizations have exposed sectarianism, anarchism, cliquism, and individualism, which are bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, during the struggle. However, we firmly believe that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," they will be able to transform their subjective world while transforming the objective world and forge themselves into thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

Believing in the strength of the masses means believing that the masses can educate themselves and liberate themselves. Whether to mobilize the masses and let them rise up to make a revolution is the key to carrying out this Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." In the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, we have seen with our own eyes: the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, dare to fight, dare to do, dare to make a revolution, and dare to rebel. They can say it and do it. Once mobilized, their momentum is like a sudden storm, breaking through the numerous obstacles set up by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Whether it is the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, China's Khrushchev, or reactionary academic "authorities," they have all been beaten to a pulp and are in a sorry state. In the days when we fought together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we studied Chairman Mao's works actively and practically while fighting, and many difficult problems encountered in the struggle were solved smoothly by relying on the broad masses who had mastered Mao Zedong Thought. When the struggle encountered setbacks and the situation was very difficult, we closely united, supported each other, and fought shoulder to shoulder, overcoming numerous difficulties and achieving one victory after another.

Believing in the future of the masses means believing that the revolutionary mass movement under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought has a bright future, and the world belongs to the people. When the revolutionary masses rise up to rebel, break through old frameworks, and disrupt old orders, some people are full of worries and doubts, fearing that things will get out of control and be difficult to manage. Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without clearing the way, there can be no progress." Some places seemed very chaotic for a while, but in fact, it was chaotic for the enemy and tempered the masses. It is precisely this "chaos" that has disrupted the counter-revolutionary ranks of the command center of the bourgeoisie, smashed their evil plots to usurp the Party, usurp the government, usurp the military, and attempt to restore capitalism. It is precisely this "chaos" that has destroyed the old order carefully cultivated by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and established a new order of proletarian revolution. It is precisely through this great destruction and construction of the revolution that a new world of Mao Zedong Thought has been created.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "New things replace old things is a universal and irresistible law in the universe." The Cultural Revolution in Zhejiang Province over the past year and more has also developed according to this revolutionary dialectic. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, who were once so powerful, have been defeated by the "small people" representing the new forces after several battles and victories, and have achieved decisive victories in the Cultural Revolution. After more than a year of intense class struggle, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards have been greatly educated and tempered. The young generation of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause is growing vigorously. The situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is getting better and better!

Correctly understand oneself and be a student of the masses

The great leader Chairman Mao humbly says: "To learn from the masses together with all Party comrades and to continue to be a student is my wish."

Whether to place oneself in the position of a student of the masses and a servant of the people, or in the position of Zhuge Liang or an official, is a test for every comrade. We have come to realize that to sincerely be a student of the masses and a servant of the people, one must correctly understand oneself and treat oneself.

To be a student of the masses, one must correctly treat one's past merits and contributions. Comrades who have participated in the revolution for a longer time have all, under the leadership and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, done some work for the people and made some contributions. However, because some of our worldviews have not been thoroughly transformed, we have carried the burden of "living on past merits," become arrogant due to our merits, and thought we were great. Therefore, in the Cultural Revolution, we could not correctly treat the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards, and we made mistakes. Our past work for the revolution was glorious. But this glory should first be attributed to the great leader Chairman Mao, to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and to the broad masses of the people. Without Chairman Mao's personal leadership, without Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, without Chairman Mao's brilliant and great strategic deployment, without the hard struggle of hundreds of millions of people, and without the blood and sacrifice of countless comrades-in-arms, how could we talk about individual merits and achievements? In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we can only follow the great leader Chairman Mao, honestly and respectfully be students of the Red Guards and the broad revolutionary masses, and revolutionize and rebel with them to establish new merits and build new labor, inheriting and carrying forward the historical glory of our Party and our army.

To be a student of the masses, one must correctly treat one's experience. When we first entered the Cultural Revolution, we always thought that the Red Guards were just children who didn't understand much, and we thought we had rich experience in struggle, so we did everything according to the old rules and frameworks. This inevitably led to mistakes. We older cadres do have some experience, but we cannot view our experience with a metaphysical perspective. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The situation is constantly changing, and to make our thoughts adapt to the new situation, we must learn. Even for those who have a relatively good understanding of Marxism and have a relatively firm proletarian standpoint, they still need to learn, accept new things, and study new problems." Today's new things and new problems are the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The socialist revolution has developed to a new stage. Some of our past experiences are no longer applicable. If we insist on using old frameworks to fit new things and using old experiences to solve new problems, it is very easy to make mistakes. Practice has proven that in the Cultural Revolution, the ones who are truly the most experienced and the most capable are the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards who are directly engaged in revolutionary practice. They fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party with courage and strategy. In the struggle, they actively and practically study Chairman Mao's works, and their political awareness and ideological level have improved rapidly. They are our best teachers, and we should learn from them, learn, and learn again.

To be a student of the masses, one must correctly treat one's authority. Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the people have entrusted us with the responsibility of leadership and the power to handle affairs. This is the greatest trust in us. However, some comrades have taken this trust as a burden, acted arrogantly, did not consult with the masses when there were matters, treated people unequally, were not democratic, liked to scold and train people, and seriously alienated themselves from the masses. In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the masses' dissatisfaction with this is entirely reasonable. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people." The higher our position, the more we should be humble and cautious, guard against arrogance and impatience, not stand above the masses as officials and lords; but place ourselves among the masses, forever be servants of the people. "Frowning at the criticism of thousands of people, bowing down to be a cow for the children." As a leader, one especially needs to have this spirit of "a cow for the children." In carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" tasks and handling the relationship between leaders and the masses, one must not be high and mighty, pointing fingers; but should regard oneself as a son of the people, with the identity of an ordinary soldier, and together with the masses, actively and practically study Chairman Mao's works, fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, and use correct policies and one's exemplary actions to guide the masses, unite the broad masses, and successfully complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

Whether one can correctly understand oneself ultimately comes down to a worldview issue, whether to believe in and rely on the masses or to emphasize the "I." Experience tells us that leaders' thoughts cannot be special, "eating separately." In the cause of communism, there is no "natural red" or "late red," only "conscious red" and "transformed red." We must work until old age, learn until old age, and transform until old age. At any time, if we relax in actively and practically studying Chairman Mao's works and do not grasp the transformation of our thoughts, the "self" will expand, and the "I" will surface. Therefore, we must follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, study and use the "Three Articles" diligently, and work hard on fighting against selfishness, carry out ideological transformation, and thoroughly uproot the roots of revisionism. Only in this way can we always correctly place ourselves and the masses, and truly be good students of the people.

Go to the masses to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, forever follow Chairman Mao to make a revolution

In the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, we have deeply felt that "selfishness" is the main source of alienation from the masses, and to be close to the masses, we must "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism." For us, "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" has even greater significance. We have a longer history of struggle and have received more education from the Party and Chairman Mao, but the influence of old ideas in our minds is also relatively deep. As Vice Chairman Lin once pointed out: "Many comrades, although their positions are high and their seniority is old, do not mean that their thoughts are higher than others, or that their abilities are higher than others." We must not place ourselves outside the class struggle and give up the struggle to eliminate bourgeois ideas and promote proletarian ideas. Especially since we are in a higher leadership position, we are both the leaders and the trainers. If there is a little impurity in our souls, it not only relates to whether we will change or not, but also directly affects whether we can do a good job of leadership with Mao Zedong Thought and train successors.

The stormy struggle of the masses is the best crucible for revolutionaries to temper and transform themselves, and it is the best classroom for actively and practically studying Chairman Mao's works. In a certain sense, the masses represent "public." Being with the masses can accept the supervision and help of the masses at any time, dig out the "self" hidden deep in our souls, and thoroughly cure the stubborn diseases of "official," "dusk," "arrogance," "spoiled," "fear," and "protection" in our minds, and fuse ourselves with the revolutionary masses to forge a red heart that is forever loyal to Chairman Mao and the people.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the Red Guards are our best teachers in "fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism." In the days of common struggle, their fearless revolutionary spirit of defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death has deeply educated us, making us discard the "fear" and replace it with "dare." When the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party were fiercely suppressing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we and the responsible comrades of the supporting-left units braved the risk of being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries" and firmly supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat represented by the "Provincial Alliance," sharing weal and woe and sailing through storms together.

Recalling the days of war, although we had few opportunities to sit down and study, we deeply understood every instruction, every article, and every word of Chairman Mao. Our minds were focused on the liberation cause of the proletariat, and we rarely considered the "I." Our revolutionary fighting spirit was strong. This was because we lived, fought, and studied with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers every day, consulted with the masses when there were matters, and overcame difficulties with the masses. The relationship between the military and the civilians, and between the officers and the soldiers, was as close as brothers, and the class feelings were extremely deep. Therefore, we could have a strong and profound understanding of the revolutionary demands of the masses, reflect the revolutionary emotions of the masses, and have a deep class feeling for Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. After entering the city, we became big officials, had more salaries, and were easily arrogant, did not consult with the masses when there were matters, were high and mighty, and rarely understood the demands and sufferings of the masses, and the distance from the masses became greater and greater. The golden Mao Zedong Thought in our hands was no longer as emotionally deep as before. We were afraid to work hard on the "use" and afraid to touch our souls. To eliminate the officialdom and fundamentally change the situation of alienation from the masses and reality, we must go deep into the masses and "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism" with the masses.

To go to the masses to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," we must first put down our arrogance and not be afraid of losing face or prestige. Whether to dare to go to the masses and whether to be able to blend in with the masses and roll together is itself a sharp ideological struggle. We must dare to expose our thoughts with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers and fight against selfishness. Doing so will not only not lose our prestige but, on the contrary, the masses will regard us as confidants.

To go to the masses to "fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism," we must correctly treat the criticism of the masses and regard the criticism of the masses as political care for ourselves. We must welcome criticism from the revolutionary masses with the attitude of "the speaker is without guilt, the listener is cautious." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Do not be afraid of criticism. The entire army will correctly understand the world and change the world in this process of criticism." The people have the clearest sense of right and wrong and are also very reasonable. When we made mistakes and errors in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, they always discovered them first and immediately gave sharp criticism; when some comrades who made mistakes were afraid to raise the level and afraid to make a public self-criticism, they always enthusiastically helped us raise our awareness and fiercely fight against selfishness; when we made some small progress in correcting our mistakes, they always encouraged us from all sides, increasing our courage and confidence to move forward. Facts have educated us that relying closely on the masses can make us make fewer mistakes, and even if we make mistakes, we can discover them early and correct them quickly and thoroughly with the help of the masses.

The broad cadres and soldiers on the front line of the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" fight side by side with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, actively and practically study Chairman Mao's works together, and are both pioneers in criticizing revisionism and vanguards in fighting against selfishness. We must learn from them well.

The Air Force stationed in Zhejiang, with a clear banner and firm stance, has gone deep into the masses, closely connected with the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat, heart to heart, actively and practically studied Chairman Mao's works together, fought against selfishness and criticized revisionism, implemented Chairman Mao's theories, lines, policies, and principles on the Cultural Revolution, and established new merits for the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. They are our good examples to learn from.

"The iron gate of the pass is like iron, but now we take the first step to cross it from the beginning." Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, we have overcome numerous difficulties, crossed numerous passes, and achieved one great victory after another. Looking ahead, the future is infinitely bright and glorious. However, fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism is a long-term task. The road is tortuous, and the struggle will have setbacks. Let us firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, humbly and respectfully be students of the masses, honestly be servants of the people, never leave the people, forever follow Chairman Mao, bravely advance against the great waves of class struggle, and carry out the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

    永远忠于毛主席，永远当群众的小学生
    南萍
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前。在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，浙江省无产阶级文化大革命的形势和全国一样，空前大好，越来越好。
    不久前，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，风尘仆仆，亲自调查了浙江省无产阶级文化大革命的情况。这是对我们浙江三千万人民和驻浙人民解放军全体指战员的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大支持，最大鞭策，是我们全省军民的最大幸福。我们满怀激动的心情，千遍万遍地欢呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！！万万岁！！！”
    毛主席接见我们的时候，亲切教导我们：遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。他老人家的伟大指示，使我们毕生难忘，永远是鼓舞我们前进的巨大力量。
        相信群众的正确，相信群众的力量，相信群众的将来
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席对待群众的根本态度。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是从群众出发，而以群众为归宿的最完全、最彻底的群众路线，它最集中地代表了广大群众的革命意志和根本利益。毛主席以举世无双的智慧和魄力，放手地发动亿万群众进行这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命。这是马克思列宁主义的群众路线在社会主义革命新阶段的创造性的运用和崭新的发展。在这场人类历史上最广泛、最深刻的革命群众运动中，对待群众的态度始终是毛主席革命路线和资产阶级反动路线斗争的焦点。从这个意义来说，对待群众的态度，就是对待毛主席革命路线的态度。
    无产阶级文化大革命的实践深刻地教育了我们：正确地对待群众最根本的是一个“信”字，就是要相信群众的正确，相信群众的力量，相信群众的将来。
    相信群众的正确，就是要相信广大革命群众的斗争大方向始终是正确的。这是能不能在无产阶级文化大革命中坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，正确地对待群众的首要问题。在浙江省一年多来的文化大革命运动中，以浙江省革命造反联合总指挥部（简称“省联总”）为代表的无产阶级革命派，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，始终把斗争矛头指向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在浙江的代理人。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，对革命的群众运动怕得要死，对无产阶级革命派恨得要命。他们极尽造谣污蔑之能事，把革命群众起来造反，说成是“牛鬼蛇神大出笼”，“右派翻天”。这正是毛主席早就批判过的把农民运动看成“痞子运动”“惰农运动”那种反动观点的翻版。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的“十六条”指出：“广大的工农兵、革命的知识分子和革命的干部，是这场文化大革命的主力军。……在这样大的革命运动中，他们难免有这样那样的缺点，但是，他们的革命大方向始终是正确的。”广大革命群众，不畏强暴，不怕围攻，以“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”的大无畏革命精神，大造中国赫鲁晓夫的反，大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造资产阶级反动路线的反，正说明他们忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，反映了他们走社会主义道路的强烈愿望，完全是造反有理，好得很！他们是无产阶级文化大革命的中坚，他们是摧毁资产阶级司令部的元勋。若否认他们，便是否认无产阶级文化大革命；若打击他们，便是打击无产阶级文化大革命。诚然，革命群众组织中一些同志，在斗争中，也暴露了小团体主义、无政府主义、宗派主义和个人主义等资产阶级和小资产阶级思潮。但是，我们坚信，在毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大方针指引下，他们一定能够在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，把自己锻炼成彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    相信群众的力量，就是要相信群众能够自己教育自己，自己解放自己。敢不敢放手发动群众，让群众自己起来闹革命，是能不能搞好这场无产阶级文化大革命的关键。毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。在“三支”“两军”工作中，我们亲眼看到：用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，敢闯、敢干、敢革命、敢造反，说得出，做得到。他们一经发动起来，其势如暴风骤雨，冲决了资产阶级反动路线所设置的重重障碍，什么党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，什么中国赫鲁晓夫，什么反动学术“权威”，统统被他们打得落花流水，狼狈不堪。在我们与无产阶级革命派共同战斗的日子里，一起带着斗争中的问题活学活用毛主席著作，斗争中遇到的许多疑难问题，依靠掌握了毛泽东思想的广大群众，就能迎刃而解。当斗争出现反复，处境十分困难的时候，我们紧密团结，互相支持，并肩战斗，克服了重重困难，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
    相信群众的将来，就是要相信在毛泽东思想指导下的革命群众运动，前途无限光明，世界是属于人民群众的。当革命群众起来造反，冲破旧框框，打乱旧秩序的时候，有些人忧虑重重，怀疑观望，他们害怕乱了套，不好收拾。毛主席说：不破不立，不塞不流。有些地方前一段好象很乱，其实那是乱了敌人，锻炼了群众。正是这种“乱”，打乱了资产阶级司令部的反革命阵脚，粉碎了他们篡党、篡政、篡军，妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋。正是这种“乱”，摧毁了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派苦心经营的旧秩序，建立了无产阶级革命的新秩序。正是经过这场革命的大破大立，才创造出一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新天下。
    毛主席教导我们：“新陈代谢是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抵抗的规律。”浙江省一年多来的文化大革命，也正是按照这一革命的辩证法发展的。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，曾几何时，赫赫不可一世。但是，代表着新生力量的“小人物”，经过了几番搏斗，几回激战，终于战胜这个庞然大物，取得了文化大革命决定性的胜利。经过一年多来激烈的阶级斗争，广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，受到极大的教育和锻炼，无产阶级革命事业接班人的年青一代，正在茁壮地成长。无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好！
             正确认识自己　做群众的小学生
    伟大领袖毛主席非常谦逊地说：“和全党同志共同一起向群众学习，继续当一个小学生，这就是我的志愿。”
    把自己放在群众的小学生、勤务员的位置，还是放在诸葛亮、官老爷的位置，对我们每个同志都是一个考验。我们体会到，要真心诚意地做群众的小学生，做人民的勤务员，就必须正确认识自己和对待自己。
    做群众的小学生，就要正确对待自己过去的功劳和贡献。我们参加革命时间长一点的同志，在党和毛主席的领导、教育下，都或多或少地为人民做过一些工作，有过一些贡献。但由于我们一些同志的世界观没有得到彻底改造，背了个吃老本的包袱，居功骄傲，自以为了不起，因而在文化大革命中，不能正确对待革命群众和红卫兵小将，犯了错误。我们过去为革命做过一些有益的工作，是光荣的。但这个光荣首先应该归功于伟大领袖毛主席，归功于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，归功于广大人民群众。如果没有毛主席的亲自领导，没有毛主席的革命路线，没有毛主席英明伟大的战略部署，没有亿万人民群众的艰苦奋斗，没有千千万万的战友流血牺牲，那能谈得到个人的功劳和成绩呢？在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们只有紧跟伟大领袖毛主席，老老实实、恭恭敬敬地做红卫兵小将和广大革命群众的小学生，和他们一起革命，一起造反，才能为人民立新功，建新劳，继承和发扬我党我军的历史荣誉。
    做群众的小学生，就要正确对待自己的经验。我们刚介入文化大革命的时候，总认为红卫兵是小娃娃，不懂事，自以为自己斗争经验丰富，一切照旧章法、老框框办事。这就难免不犯错误。我们老一点的干部，经验是有一些的，但是，不能用形而上学的观点来看待自己的经验。毛主席教导我们：“情况是在不断地变化，要使自己的思想适应新的情况，就得学习。即使是对于马克思主义已经了解得比较多的人，无产阶级立场比较坚定的人，也还是要再学习，要接受新事物，要研究新问题。”今天的新事物，新问题就是无产阶级文化大革命。社会主义革命已经发展到一个新阶段。我们过去的经验有的已经不适用了。如果硬要用旧框框来套新事物，用老经验来解决新问题，就很容易犯错误。事实证明，在文化大革命中，真正最有经验最聪明能干的，是那些直接进行革命实践的广大的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将。他们向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，有勇有谋，他们在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，政治觉悟和思想水平提高得很快，他们是我们最好的老师，应该向他们学习、学习、再学习。
    做群众的小学生，就要正确对待自己的职权。毛主席、党中央和人民群众把领导的责任交给我们，把办事的权力委托给我们，这是对我们最大的信任。有些同志却把这种信任当成包袱背起来，摆架子，有事不跟群众商量，不平等待人，不民主，喜欢骂人，训人，严重脱离了群众。在无产阶级文化大革命中，群众对此表示不满，是完全合理的。毛主席教导说：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。我们的职位越高，就越应当谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，不是高居于群众之上，当官做老爷；而是置身于群众之中，永远做人民的勤务员。“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛。”作为一个领导干部，特别需要具备这种“孺子牛”的精神。在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，在处理领导和群众的关系时，决不能高高在上，指手划脚；而应当把自己看成是人民的儿子，以普通一兵的身份，和群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起“斗私，批修”，用正确的政策和自己的模范行动来引导群众，团结广大群众，胜利地完成党交给的任务。
    能不能正确认识自己，归根到底是一个世界观问题，是相信和依靠群众，还是突出“我”字的问题。经验告诉我们，领导干部思想不能特殊化，“吃小灶”。在共产主义事业中，没有什么“自来红”、“老来红”，只有“自觉红”、“改造红”。我们要干到老，学到老，改造到老。任何时候，稍一放松活学活用毛主席著作，稍不抓紧改造思想，“私”字就会膨胀，“我”字就要露头。所以，我们必须遵照林副主席的指示，狠学狠用“老三篇”，在斗私上狠下功夫，搞好思想革命化，彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。这样，才能永远摆对自己和群众的位置，才能真正做好人民群众的小学生。
      到群众中去斗私批修永远跟着毛主席干革命
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们深深地体会到：“私”字是脱离群众的主要根源，要密切联系群众就必须“斗私，批修”。对我们这些人来说，“斗私，批修”具有更为重大的意义。我们斗争经历较长，受党和毛主席的教育较多，但是，头脑里旧思想的影响也比较深。正如林副主席曾经指出的：“许多同志地位虽然高，资格虽然老，但不等于思想就比人家高，不等于才能比人家高。”我们决不能把自己超然于阶级斗争之外，放弃灭资兴无的斗争。尤其是我们处在较高的领导地位，既是当班人，又是带班人，我们灵魂深处存在一点污浊，不仅仅是关系着个人变不变质的问题，还直接影响着我们能不能用毛泽东思想做好领导工作，带好接班人的问题。
    群众斗争的急风暴雨，是革命者锻炼自己、改造自己的最好熔炉，是活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。在某种意义上说，群众就代表“公”。和群众在一起，就能随时接受群众的监督和帮助，挖出隐藏在我们灵魂深处的“私”字，把它批倒批臭，彻底医治好自己头脑里“官”、“暮”、“骄”、“娇”、“怕”、“保”等顽症，把自己和革命群众溶化在一起，炼出一颗永远忠于毛主席，忠于人民群众的红心。
    广大无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，是我们“斗私，批修”的最好老师。在共同战斗的日子里，他们誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线的大无畏革命精神，深深地教育了我们，使我们丢掉了“怕”字，换上了“敢”字。在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂镇压无产阶级革命派的时候，我们和兄弟支左部队负责同志，冒着被打成“反革命”的危险，坚定地支持了以“省联总”为代表的无产阶级革命派，和他们患难与共，风雨同舟。
    回想在战争年代里，虽然我们坐下来读书的机会很少，但对毛主席的每个指示，每篇文章，每一句话，体会比较深，学一句用一句。心中想的是无产阶级的解放事业，很少考虑“我”字，革命斗志旺盛。那是因为我们天天和工农兵群众生活在一起，战斗在一起，学习在一起，有事和群众商量，有困难和群众一起克服。军民之间，官兵之间亲如兄弟，阶级感情无比深厚。因此，我们能够比较强烈而深刻地了解群众的革命要求，反映群众的革命情绪，对毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线也就有了深厚的阶级感情。进城以后，我们官做大了，薪水多了，容易摆架子，有事不和群众商量，高高在上，对群众的要求和疾苦很少体会，和群众的距离越来越远。金光闪闪的毛主席著作拿到手里，感情不象过去那么深了，怕在“用”字上下功夫，怕触及自己灵魂了。要打掉“官”气，从根本上改变脱离群众、脱离实际的状况，就必须深入到群众中去，和群众一起“斗私，批修”。
    到群众中去“斗私，批修”，首先要放下架子，不能怕丢掉面子，失掉威信。敢不敢到群众中去，能不能和群众打成一片，滚在一起，本身就是一场尖锐的思想斗争。我们要敢于和广大工农兵群众一起亮思想，斗私心。这样做，不但不会失掉自己的威信，相反地群众会把我们当作知心人。
    到群众中去“斗私，批修”，就要正确对待群众的批评，要把群众的批评，看作是对自己政治上的爱护，要以“言者无罪，闻者足戒”的态度，欢迎来自革命群众的批评。毛主席教导我们：“不要怕批评，全军在这种批评过程中，将会正确地认识世界，并改造世界”。人民群众是非分得最清，也最通情达理。当我们在“三支”
  “两军”工作中产生了缺点和错误时，总是他们首先发现，立即提出尖锐批评；当有些犯错误的同志怕上线上纲，怕公开检讨时，总是他们热情地帮助我们提高认识，狠斗私心；当我们改正错误获得一些微小的进步时，总是他们从各方面鼓励我们，增加我们前进的勇气和信心。事实教育了我们，紧紧依靠群众，就可以少犯错误，即使犯了错误，在群众的帮助下就能发现得早，改正得快，改得彻底。
    广大的干部、战士，处在“三支”“两军”的第一线，他们和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，一起活学活用毛主席著作，既是批修的闯将，又是斗私的尖兵。我们要很好地向他们学习。
    支左旗帜鲜明，立场坚定的驻浙江空军部队的指战员，深入群众，同广大无产阶级革命派息息相关，心心相连，一起活学活用毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，把毛主席关于文化大革命的理论、路线、方针、政策落实于行动，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了新功。他们是我们学习的好榜样。
    “雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。”在伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，我们战胜了无数困难，跨越了无数关口，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。展望前程，无限光辉灿烂。但是，斗私批修是长期的战斗任务。道路是曲折的，斗争还会有反复。让我们牢牢记住毛主席的伟大教导，恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生，老老实实地做人民的勤务员，一刻也不脱离人民群众，永远跟着毛主席，迎着阶级斗争的大风大浪奋勇前进，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
