The leadership organs of the various general departments and military branches of the People's Liberation Army have called on their subordinate units to seriously study Chairman Mao's latest instructions. Follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, follow the new situation.

Education on the situation is the most practical education in Mao Zedong Thought. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to correctly observe and analyze the current excellent situation can one more consciously follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Xinhua News Agency, November 11th: The leadership organs of the various general departments and military branches of the People's Liberation Army have recently called on their subordinate units to focus on education on the situation, seriously study and deeply understand Chairman Mao's statements on the situation, and use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and summarize the new trends, achievements, experiences, and problems that have emerged in the movement. This will enable the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to keep up with the developing new situation, follow Chairman Mao, follow Mao Zedong Thought, and follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, achieving new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: "The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country is excellent, not just good. The overall situation is better than ever before. The important sign of an excellent situation is that the masses have been fully mobilized. No previous mass movements have been as extensive and deep as this one." The General Staff Department, General Logistics Department, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, National Defense Industrial Office, Navy, Air Force, Second Artillery, Engineering Corps, Artillery Corps, Chemical Defense Corps, Signal Corps, Armored Corps, and Railway Corps, as well as the Party Committees of military academies stationed in Beijing and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers, unanimously agreed during the study and discussion of Chairman Mao's latest instructions that Chairman Mao's brilliant analysis is the most scientific, complete, profound, and thorough analysis and summary of the current situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country. Organizing the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to deeply study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation, using Mao Zedong Thought to correctly observe and analyze the current excellent situation, and focusing on education on the situation is a very important task at present. They said that Chairman Mao has always attached importance to education on the situation. As early as the 1929 Gutao Conference resolution, he clearly pointed out that it is necessary to "educate Party members to use the methods of Marxism-Leninism to analyze the political situation and estimate the strength of classes, replacing subjective analysis and estimation." Education on the situation is a fine tradition of our Party and our army. Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for observing and analyzing the situation. Conducting education on the situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the most practical education in Mao Zedong Thought and the most practical education in class struggle and the struggle between the two lines. Only by using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a telescope and a microscope to observe and analyze the complex class struggle situation can we stand high, see far, see deeply, and see clearly. Only then can we distinguish right from wrong and friend from foe in the sharp and complex class struggle, stand firmly on the proletarian standpoint, and more consciously follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, truly achieving a clear mind, clear direction, standing in the right ranks, and achieving new victories. They pointed out that using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation means, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, first focusing on the movements of the masses. The movements of the masses determine the essence of the revolutionary situation. Judging the situation from the movements of the masses is an embodiment of Chairman Mao's belief in the masses, reliance on the masses, and the mass line. Looking at the situation of the Cultural Revolution means looking at the level of awareness and organization of the masses. Focusing on the movements of the masses to look at the Cultural Revolution will see that the situation is excellent, with a clear mind and bright eyes. They also pointed out that only by using Mao Zedong Thought to observe and analyze the situation can one grasp the essence of things, distinguish between the mainstream and the secondary, and not be misled by temporary and local surface phenomena. Grasping the essence and seeing the mainstream will enable one to more deeply understand the profound significance of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, better see the great revolutionary spirit and creative power of the masses, see the unprecedented scale of the great popularization, deepening, and elevation of Mao Zedong Thought, and its immense power, thereby recognizing the excellent situation and confidently striving for the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The leadership organs of the various general departments and military branches have, through study and discussion, made arrangements and deployments for strengthening education on the situation, requiring their subordinate units to more deeply and extensively study Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the situation, study the editorial "Focus on Education on the Situation" of the *Liberation Army Daily*, and in conjunction with the year-end evaluation of the Four Good Units and Four Good Companies, extensively discuss the unprecedented excellent situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They require their subordinate units to, in education on the situation, fully mobilize the masses, adopt various forms such as reporting meetings, reading newspapers, listening to broadcasts, and inviting local revolutionary rebels to give reports, making education on the situation lively and vigorous. They require leaders at all levels to put politics in command, go to the masses, and solidly grasp education on the situation. Some leadership organs also require their subordinate units to regard education on the situation as a regular practice, grasping it year after year, month after month, and continuously, so that cadres and soldiers always maintain a clear mind and correct direction, forever following the great commander Chairman Mao and marching forward bravely.

    解放军各总部各军种兵种领导机关号召所属部队认真学习毛主席最新指示
    紧跟毛主席  紧跟毛泽东思想  紧跟新形势
    形势教育是最现实的毛泽东思想教育，只有用毛泽东思想正确观察和分析当前大好形势，才能更自觉地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在无产阶级文化大革命中立新功
    新华社十一日讯　中国人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种领导机关，最近号召所属部队大抓形势教育，认真学习、深刻领会毛主席关于形势的论述，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想分析和总结运动中出现的新动向，新成就，新经验，新问题，使广大指战员不断跟上发展着的新形势，紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：“全国的无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，不是小好。整个形势比以往任何时候都好。形势大好的重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。从来的群众运动都没有象这次发动得这么广泛，这么深入。”总参谋部、总后勤部、国防科委、国防工办、海军、空军、第二炮兵、工程兵、炮兵、防化学兵、通信兵、装甲兵、铁道兵等领导机关和驻京军事院校党委和广大指战员，在学习和讨论毛主席这一最新指示的时候，一致认为，毛主席的英明论述，是对当前我国无产阶级文化大革命形势最科学、最完整、最精辟、最透彻的分析和总结。组织广大指战员深入学习毛主席关于形势的最新指示，用毛泽东思想正确观察分析当前的大好形势，抓好形势教育，是当前一项极为重要的任务。他们说，毛主席历来重视形势教育，早在一九二九年古田会议决议中就明确指出，必须“教育党员用马克思列宁主义的方法去作政治形势的分析和阶级势力的估量，以代替主观主义的分析和估量。”形势教育是我党、我军的优良传统。毛泽东思想是观察分析形势的最锐利的武器。在无产阶级文化大革命中进行形势教育，就是最现实的毛泽东思想教育，就是最现实的阶级斗争、两条路线斗争的教育。我们只有用战无不胜的毛泽东思想这个望远镜和显微镜，去观察分析错综复杂的阶级斗争形势，才能使我们站得高、看得远、看得深、看得透，才能在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中辨明是非，分清敌我，站稳无产阶级立场，更自觉地紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，真正做到头脑清，方向明，站好队，立新功。他们指出，用毛泽东思想观察和分析形势，就要根据毛主席的教导，首先把着眼点放在群众动向上。群众的动向，决定革命形势的本质。从群众的动向来判断形势，是毛主席相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线的体现。看文化大革命的形势，就是要看群众的觉悟程度和组织程度。着眼于群众的动向来看文化大革命，就会看到形势一片大好，心明眼亮。他们还指出，只有用毛泽东思想观察和分析形势，才能抓住事物的本质，分清主流和支流，不被一时一地的表面现象所迷惑。抓住本质，看清主流，才能更深刻地认识无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义，才能更好地看到人民群众伟大的革命精神和创造力量，看到毛泽东思想空前规模地大普及、大深入、大提高所产生的无比巨大的威力，从而认清大好形势，信心百倍地去夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    各总部、各军种兵种领导机关通过学习讨论，对加强形势教育，分别作了安排部署，要求所属部队更加深入广泛地学习毛主席关于形势的最新指示，学习《解放军报》社论《抓好形势教育》，结合年终四好连队、四好单位的总评，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。要求所属部队在形势教育中，充分发动群众，采取讲用会、读报、听广播、请地方无产阶级革命派作报告等多种形式，把形势教育搞得生动活泼，轰轰烈烈。要求各级领导干部要政治挂帅，到群众中去，扎扎实实地抓好形势教育。有些领导机关还要求所属部队把形势教育作为一项制度，年年抓，月月抓，经常抓，使指战员们始终保持清醒的头脑和正确的方向，永远跟着伟大统帅毛主席奋勇前进。
