A certain unit of the PLA stationed in Shanghai has helped the financial and commercial system to adopt the method of "combining internal and external efforts, opening the door to education" to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes. They mobilize cadres to consciously engage in self-criticism and struggle against selfishness and revisionism, and invite revolutionary masses to the study classes to enthusiastically help cadres.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, November 11, the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Shanghai, along with the financial and commercial group of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary fighting team of the financial and commercial cadre school, have taken "struggling against selfishness and revisionism" as the key, and adopted the method of "combining internal and external efforts, opening the door to education" to hold Mao Zedong Thought study classes for cadres, achieving good results.

"Combining internal and external efforts, opening the door to education" means that, in addition to concentrated study, cadres are encouraged to frequently return to their own systems and units to report their study situations to the revolutionary committees and proletarian revolutionary factions, participate in self-criticism meetings, and go to the places where the masses have the most criticisms to accept criticism and help. On the other hand, revolutionary factions and revolutionary leading cadres are invited to the study classes to help cadres, further understand cadres, and thus more effectively help cadres to quickly stand up for the revolution.

The soldiers of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit of the PLA stationed in Shanghai always remember Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "People are the primary factor, political work is the primary factor, ideological work is the primary factor, and living thoughts are the primary factor." Based on the army's experience of emphasizing politics and focusing on living thoughts, before and after the opening of the cadre study classes, they worked together with the revolutionary factions to visit various units, listen to the revolutionary factions' introductions of the performance and ideological state of the cadres who were about to participate in the study classes, and also held cadre meetings to understand the living thoughts of the cadres. Through in-depth investigation and analysis, they found that after more than a year of tempering in the Cultural Revolution, the political awareness of these cadres had improved, their sense of the masses had strengthened, and cadres who had made mistakes in the movement had initially recognized their mistakes and were determined to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, due to the "self" in their minds, they still had various living thoughts: cadres who had been criticized had grievances, some were not satisfied with the revolutionary factions, some wanted to stand up but lacked courage; some were afraid of saying the wrong thing in the study class and being criticized, and some were afraid that after studying, their problems would not be solved. Aiming at these living thoughts, the soldiers of the PLA and the responsible comrades of the study class firmly grasped the key of "struggling against selfishness and revisionism" and adopted the method of "combining internal and external efforts, opening the door to education" to educate the cadres more deeply and help them quickly free themselves from the shackles of "self."

When mobilizing cadres to participate in the study classes and go to the masses in their own systems and units, many had concerns, fearing that the masses would say they were showing off, fearing that they would encounter obstacles. No matter how much they feared, they still feared the masses. This thought was the biggest obstacle for cadres to learn from the masses and accept the masses' help, and the root cause was that they did not truly understand Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the "self" was at work. The soldiers of the PLA, when helping cadres study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, repeatedly studied with the cadres Chairman Mao's teachings of "never leaving the masses at any time" and "we communists should face the wind and rain and see the world," inspiring the cadres to discard the "fear" and consciously go to the masses to expose their "self," struggle against it, and lay a good ideological foundation for them to go to the masses to make self-criticisms. Some cadres who were afraid to expose their thoughts initially only found external causes and not internal causes, only talked about phenomena and not essences, only talked about objects and not subjects. Later, under the influence of the PLA comrades, they all put themselves in the struggle between the two lines, deeply excavated their selfish hearts, and made self-criticisms. They deeply realized that the main reason for their mistakes was: over the past decade, their positions had become higher, their salaries had become more, their airs had become bigger, and they gradually developed from not believing in the masses to alienating from the masses, and even suppressing the masses.

Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's latest instructions, and with the enthusiastic encouragement of the PLA and revolutionary factions, the cadres participating in the study classes all went to the places where the masses had the most criticisms to make self-criticisms and listen to the masses' opinions. Some leading cadres, on a Sunday, consecutively visited several units to report their study experiences to the revolutionary masses and check their past mistakes of long-term unequal treatment and putting on airs. The revolutionary factions and the broad masses warmly welcomed these cadres who voluntarily came to check themselves, enthusiastically encouraging them, which further educated and inspired the cadres. A cadre from Jing'an District had executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the movement and was criticized by the masses. Initially, he wrongly thought that this was the workers taking revenge on him, and later he felt that the bourgeois reactionary line was imposed by the Chinese Khrushchev, not his own creation, and he felt wronged. After studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, he had a fierce struggle in his mind, realizing that the subjective reason for executing the bourgeois reactionary line in the early stage of the movement was still the "self" in his soul. Thinking of these, he made up his mind to first go to the place where he had caused the most harm by executing the bourgeois reactionary line, report his study experiences, and check his mistakes. The revolutionary faction leader who had been persecuted by him not only warmly received him but also encouraged him, saying, "Your past mistakes, if you check and correct them, are good." This cadre, after returning to the study class, deeply felt that, "Chairman Mao's teaching of cadres going to the masses is truly the greatest concern and care for cadres." Some cadres who had not been close to or opened their hearts to the revolutionary factions, in the heart-to-heart talks with the revolutionary factions, deeply felt that their feelings for Chairman Mao, their attitudes towards the masses, and their revolutionary spirit were not as good as the revolutionary factions. They said in their feelings: my parents gave birth to me, Chairman Mao taught me, Chinese Khrushchev harmed me, and the proletarian revolutionary faction comrades helped me. Some units' revolutionary factions saw that the cadres exposed their "self" thoroughly and made sincere self-criticisms, and immediately announced the liberation of the cadres, which deeply moved the cadres.

    到群众意见最多的地方去作自我批评
    驻沪部队某部帮助财贸系统采取“内外结合，开门办学”的方法举办毛泽东思想学习班，发动干部自觉地斗私批修，邀请革命群众来学习班热情帮助干部。
    据新华社上海十一日电　人民解放军驻沪部队某部毛泽东思想宣传组和上海市革命委员会财贸组以及财贸干校革命战斗团，以“斗私，批修”为纲，采取“内外结合，开门办学”的办法，来举办干部毛泽东思想学习班，收到了良好的效果。
      “内外结合，开门办学”，就是干部除集中学习以外，一方面发动干部自觉地经常回到本系统、本单位，向革命委员会和无产阶级革命派汇报学习情况，参加斗私批修会，并到对自己意见最多的群众中去接受批评和帮助；另一方面，邀请革命派和革命领导干部到学习班来，帮助干部，进一步了解干部，从而更有力地帮助干部尽快地站出来革命。
    驻沪部队某部毛泽东思想宣传组的指战员们，牢记着林彪同志的指示：“人的因素第一，政治工作第一，思想工作第一，活的思想第一。”根据部队突出政治、大抓活思想的经验，在开办干部学习班前后的一段时间，就和革命派一起，分头登门拜访，听取各单位革命派对即将参加学习班的干部的表现和思想状况的介绍，同时召开干部座谈会，了解干部的活思想。经过深入调查和分析，了解到这批干部经过一年多文化大革命的锻炼，政治觉悟有了提高，群众观点有了增强，在运动中犯了错误的干部对自己所犯的错误已经有了初步认识，决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。但是，由于他们头脑里“私”字作怪，还存在着各种各样的活思想：挨了批判的干部有怨气，有的对革命派不服气，有的要站出来又没有勇气；还有的怕在学习班说错话被抓辫子，怕学习后，不解决问题。针对这些活思想，解放军指战员和学习班的负责同志紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，采取“内外结合，开门办学”的办法，来使干部受到更深刻的教育，促使他们自己从“私”字的枷锁中尽快地解放出来。
    动员参加学习班的干部到本系统、本单位的群众中去，开始有不少人有顾虑，怕群众说他翘尾巴，怕碰钉子。千怕万怕，还是怕群众。这种思想正是干部向群众学习，接受群众帮助的最大障碍，根本原因是他们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线没有真正理解，“私”字作怪。解放军指战员在帮助干部学习毛主席的最新指示时，同干部一起反复学习毛主席“任何时候也不要离开群众”，“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面”的教导，启发干部丢掉“怕”字，自觉地到群众中去亮私，斗私，为他们到群众中去作自我批评打好思想基础。一些斗私怕丑怕痛的干部，开始亮思想只找外因不找内因，只谈现象不挖本质，只谈客观不抓主观。后来，在解放军同志的带动下，纷纷把自己摆在两条路线的斗争中，狠挖私心，进行自我批评。他们深刻认识到，自己犯错误的主要原因是：十多年来，“官”做大了，薪水也多了，架子也大了，慢慢地由不相信群众，发展到脱离群众，甚至压制群众。
    在毛主席最新指示的光辉照耀下，在解放军和革命派的热情鼓励下，参加学习班的干部纷纷到群众意见最多的地方，去作自我批评，听取群众意见。有的领导干部在一个星期日连续跑了几个单位去向革命群众汇报学习体会，检查自己过去长期不平等待人，摆官架子等错误。革命派和广大群众对这些主动上门来检查的干部笑脸相迎，热情鼓励，更使干部受到很大的教育和鼓舞。静安区的一位干部在运动中执行了资产阶级反动路线，受到了群众批判。开始，他错误地认为这是职工对他打击报复，后来又感到资产阶级反动路线是中国赫鲁晓夫贯下来的，不是自己的创造，心里很委屈。学习了毛主席的最新指示，他思想上展开了激烈斗争，认识到运动初期执行资产阶级反动路线的主观原因，还是自己灵魂深处的“私”字作怪。他想到这些，就下定决心，首先到自己执行资产阶级反动路线造成危害最大的地方去，汇报学习体会，检讨错误。曾被他整过的革命派负责人，不仅热情接待了他，还鼓励说：“你过去的错误，检讨了，改正了，就好。”这个干部回到学习班后深有体会地说：“毛主席要干部到群众中去的教导，真是对干部的最大关怀，最大爱护。”一些本来对革命派不接近、不交心的干部，在同革命派促膝交谈中，深感自己对毛主席的感情，对群众的态度和自己的革命精神，都不如革命派，越谈越感到革命派可爱可亲。他们在谈自己的感受时说：生我的是父母，教我的是毛主席，害我的是中国赫鲁晓夫，帮我的是无产阶级革命派战友。有些单位的革命派看到干部亮私彻底，检讨诚恳，当场就宣布解放干部，使干部深受感动。
