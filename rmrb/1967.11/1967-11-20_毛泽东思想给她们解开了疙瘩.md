A few years ago, Liu Shulan and Dong Guirong, textile storage workers at the Beijing New Overseas Hotel, had a conflict at work that hurt their feelings, and the knot in their minds remained unresolved.

The Cultural Revolution began, and the New Overseas Hotel was divided into two factions. Liu Shulan joined the "Revolutionary Construction Corps," and Dong Guirong joined the "Red Flag Corps." As the struggle between the two factions intensified, Liu Shulan and Dong Guirong's relationship became increasingly strained. They looked at each other with displeasure and even deliberately found faults and picked quarrels. Eventually, they stopped talking to each other, and for work-related communications, they had others relay messages or wrote notes. Once, Dong Guirong left a note on the table, which Liu Shulan did not notice, resulting in a delay. They had a heated argument, each blaming the other, both feeling they were in the right, and the conflict became even more acute.

In mid-October, the hotel organized a Mao Zedong Thought study class, and Liu Shulan and Dong Guirong were placed in the same study group. Initially, neither wanted to go, feeling awkward around each other. Later, they both decided to participate with the intention of debating.

The study class began, and the first lesson was studying "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao said: "We all come from the rivers and lakes, for a common revolutionary goal, we have come together. ... All revolutionary comrades must care for each other, love each other, and help each other."

Chairman Mao's words were like the sun, shining brightly, warming the heart. Liu Shulan read and thought about them over and over again, comparing herself to them. The more she compared, the more she felt she was wrong. Not even speaking, how could she talk about "caring for each other, loving each other"? She should apologize to Little Dong.

Little Dong, after studying Chairman Mao's latest instructions, also felt she was wrong. Chairman Mao said that within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. What reason do we have to be so opposed? What faults does Little Liu have? She listed Liu Shulan's strengths and weaknesses one by one on paper. No matter how she wrote, there were more strengths and fewer weaknesses. She also decided to apologize to Little Liu.

Liu Shulan made up her mind, put aside the "self," and went to find Dong Guirong. Years of estrangement, not speaking for half a year, suddenly facing each other, there were countless words but none to say. The two tightly held hands, apologized to each other, criticized themselves, and were so moved that they shed tears. They were both happy and sad; happy that listening to Chairman Mao's words had resolved the long-standing conflict and united the comrades; sad that they had not followed Chairman Mao's instructions properly in the past. They encouraged each other to study Chairman Mao's works better in the future, to drive out the "self" and let the "public" settle in.

From then on, Liu Shulan and Dong Guirong changed completely, working together in unity for the revolution, cooperating heartily in their work, helping each other in their studies, and caring for each other in their lives. The hotel staff all praised them for studying Chairman Mao's works well and praised the Mao Zedong Thought study class for being well-organized. (Photo attached)

### 毛泽东思想给她们解开了疙瘩

    毛泽东思想给她们解开了疙瘩
    前几年，北京新侨饭店棉织品保管员刘淑兰和董桂茹，在工作中发生了摩擦，伤了感情，思想疙瘩一直没有解开。
    文化大革命开始了，新侨饭店分成了两大派。刘淑兰参加了“革造兵团”，董桂茹参加了“红旗兵团”。随着两派斗争的尖锐化，刘淑兰和董桂茹的关系也越来越僵，互相看着不顺眼，甚至有意挑毛病，找茬儿。到后来，干脆互不说话，工作上的交接来往，让别人传话，或写小条子。有一次，董桂茹写了条子放在桌上，刘淑兰没有发现，结果误了事，两人吵了一通，互相说对方的不是，都觉得自己有理，矛盾越发尖锐起来。
    十月中旬，饭店办起了毛泽东思想学习班，刘淑兰和董桂茹被编在一个学习小组。开始，两人都不愿去，看着对方别扭。后来，都抱着去辩论的目的参加了。
    学习班开课了，第一堂课，就是学习《为人民服务》。毛主席说：“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。……一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”
    毛主席的话象太阳，句句放光芒，字字暖心肠。刘淑兰一遍又一遍地读，一遍又一遍地想，一遍又一遍地对照自己。越对照，越觉得自己不对，连话都不说，怎么还谈得上“互相关心，互相爱护”呢？应当向小董道歉。
    小董呢？学习了毛主席的最新指示，也觉得自己错了。毛主席说，在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。我们有什么理由这样对立呢？小刘到底有什么缺点呢？她把刘淑兰的优点和缺点一条一条列在纸上，写来写去，就是优点多，缺点少。她也决定找小刘赔不是。
    刘淑兰下定决心，抛开了“私”字，去找董桂茹。几年来的隔阂，半年多没说话，乍一见面，千言万语无从说起，两人紧紧地握着手，互相道歉，各自批评自己，激动得流下了眼泪。两人又是高兴，又是难过，高兴的是，听了毛主席的话，多日的矛盾解决了，战友团结了；难过的是，过去没好好按照毛主席的指示办事。两人互相勉励，今后一定更好地学习毛主席著作，把私字扫地出门，让公字安家落户。
    从此以后，刘淑兰和董桂茹完全变了样，团结一致干革命，同心协力搞工作，学习上互相帮助，生活上互相关心。饭店职工都夸奖她们毛主席著作学得好，赞扬毛泽东思想学习班办得好。（附图片）
