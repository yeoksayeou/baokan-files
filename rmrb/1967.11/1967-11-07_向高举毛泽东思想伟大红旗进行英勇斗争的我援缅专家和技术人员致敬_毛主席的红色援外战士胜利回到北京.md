The red experts and technicians from China who have helped the people of Myanmar in economic construction and forged deep friendships with them have returned to the capital Beijing in triumph. They are welcomed by Premier Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and revolutionary masses from the capital.

Thousands of soldiers and civilians shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with all reactionaries!

Xinhua News Agency, November 6th: Four hundred and twelve Chinese red experts and technicians who have helped the people of Myanmar in economic construction and forged deep friendships with them returned to the capital Beijing in triumph this afternoon. They returned to the side of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao, and were warmly welcomed by revolutionary masses from the capital.

Leaders from the Central Committee and the Cultural Revolution Group, including Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Zhang Chunqiao, and Chen Boda, went to the airport to welcome them.

Armed with the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, our Chinese red experts and technicians in Myanmar have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao. According to the Sino-Myanmar economic and technological cooperation agreement, they have shared joys and sorrows with the people of Myanmar, worked diligently and selflessly for the people of Myanmar, and enthusiastically helped the people of Myanmar in economic construction. They have been praised by the broad masses of the people of Myanmar. However, the Ne Win reactionary government has further betrayed the people by aligning with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, carrying out rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and brutally persecuting our experts and technicians in a fascist manner, driving them out of the country. The reactionary actions of the Ne Win government have seriously damaged the friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar and fully exposed their anti-China face.

Today, the airport was filled with a strong revolutionary fighting atmosphere. Countless red flags fluttered in the wind. Thousands of revolutionary masses, Red Guards, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, holding high the portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, singing revolutionary songs, and shouting slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with all reactionaries!" and "The Ne Win reactionary government will not have a good end for its anti-China actions!" and "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Myanmar!", welcomed the triumphant return of our Chinese experts and technicians in Myanmar, strongly protested against the heinous crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, and expressed their resolute support for the revolutionary struggle of the people of Myanmar.

The red experts and technicians in Myanmar, holding high the portraits of Chairman Mao and waving Mao's quotations, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" as they stepped off the plane. At this moment, the airport was filled with the song "Long Live Chairman Mao!", and the welcoming revolutionary masses waved Mao's quotations, shouting for a long time:

"Salute to our Chinese experts and technicians in Myanmar who bravely fought against bullying!"

Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Zhang Chunqiao, and Chen Boda went forward to shake hands with the 412 red experts and technicians in Myanmar, expressing their greetings. Zhou Enlai warmly said to them, "Congratulations on your triumphant return!" The welcoming revolutionary masses enthusiastically shouted: "Learn from our Chinese experts and technicians in Myanmar who bravely fought under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great Communist Party of China!" "Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!" The loudspeakers at the airport continuously broadcasted the songs "Father and Mother Are Not As Dear As Chairman Mao" and "The Ship Needs a Helmsman to Navigate the Seas."

Revolutionary masses presented the red experts and technicians in Myanmar with the revolutionary treasure book "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read Mao's quotations with them:

"'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only serve to promote more extensive and more violent revolution among the people."

Subsequently, Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Xie Fuzhi, Zhang Chunqiao, and Chen Boda, together with the triumphantly returned red experts and technicians in Myanmar, walked around the field to meet with the welcoming crowd. The entire welcoming crowd was extremely excited, shouting in unison: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao ten thousand times!" The slogans and drumbeats at the airport intertwined, resonating through the sky.

Those who went to the airport to welcome them today also included responsible officials from relevant departments, including Fang Yi, Fu Zuoyi, Han Nianlong, Hao Deqing, Li Qiang, Chu Tuonan, Geng Biao, Miao Shusen, Chen Weiji, Shen Hong, Ding Guoyi, Chen De, Zhao Qimin, Lan Wenchao, Zhang Wanhua, Li Guangxun, Shen Tu, and Zeng Shaodong. Also present at the airport to welcome them were the family members of Liu Yi, a Chinese expert in Myanmar who died a martyr, and other family members of experts and technicians in Myanmar who are in Beijing.

This morning, when the red experts and technicians in Myanmar left Kunming, revolutionary masses, soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, Red Guards, and responsible officials from relevant departments went to the airport to see them off.

    向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗进行英勇斗争的我援缅专家和技术人员致敬
    毛主席的红色援外战士胜利回到北京
    周恩来、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治、张春桥、戚本禹等同志和首都广大革命群众到机场热烈欢迎
    数千军民高呼：毛主席万岁！中缅两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！
    新华社六日讯　在帮助缅甸人民进行经济建设中同缅甸人民结下深厚友谊的我国红色援缅专家和技术人员四百一十二人，今天下午分乘五架专机胜利回到祖国首都北京，回到我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席身边，受到首都革命群众极其热烈的欢迎。
    中央和中央文革小组负责同志周恩来、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治、张春桥、戚本禹等，前往机场欢迎。
    用伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国红色援缅专家和技术人员，在缅甸期间，一贯遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，根据中缅两国经济技术合作协定，同缅甸人民同甘共苦、勤勤恳恳地为缅甸人民服务，满腔热情地帮助缅甸人民进行经济建设，受到了广大缅甸人民的赞扬。但是，奈温反动政府进一步投靠美帝和苏修，进行猖狂的反华排华活动，对我国专家和技术人员进行了野蛮的法西斯迫害，悍然驱逐我国专家和技术人员。奈温政府的这些反动行径，严重破坏了中缅两国人民之间的友谊，彻底暴露了它们坚持反华的狰狞面目。
    今天，首都机场洋溢着强烈的革命战斗的气氛。无数面红旗迎风飘扬。数千名革命群众、红卫兵小将和中国人民解放军指战员，高举着我们伟大领袖毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，唱着革命歌曲，高呼“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒各国反动派！”“奈温反动政府反华绝没有好下场！”“中缅两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”等口号，在机场上最热烈地欢迎我国援缅专家和技术人员凯旋归来，最强烈抗议奈温反动政府反华排华的滔天罪行，表示坚决支持缅甸人民的革命斗争。
    红色援缅专家和技术人员高举着毛主席像，挥动着《毛主席语录》，高呼“毛主席万岁”走下飞机。这时，机场上空响彻了《万岁！毛主席》的歌声，欢迎的革命群众挥动着《毛主席语录》，长时间地高呼：
  “向不畏强暴坚决斗争的我国援缅专家和技术人员致敬！”
    周恩来、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治、张春桥、戚本禹等同志，迎上前去，同四百一十二名红色援缅专家和技术人员，一一握手，表示慰问。周恩来同志亲切地对他们说：“祝你们胜利归来！”欢迎的革命群众热烈高呼：“向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的我国援缅专家和技术人员学习！”“伟大的无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的中国共产党万岁！”“我们伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”机场的广播器里不断地播出《爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲》和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声。
    革命群众代表向红色援缅专家和技术人员赠送了革命宝书《毛主席语录》，并且和他们一起朗读毛主席语录：
      “‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    随后，周恩来、李富春、陈毅、李先念、谢富治、张春桥、戚本禹等同志，同胜利归来的红色援缅专家和技术人员一起，绕场一周，同欢迎的群众见面。全场欢迎群众万分激动，有节奏地热烈欢呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”机场上的口号声，锣鼓声，交织成一片，响彻天空。
    今天到机场欢迎的，还有各有关方面的负责人方毅、傅作义、韩念龙、郝德青、李强、楚图南、耿飚、苗树森、陈维稷、沈鸿、丁国钰、陈德三、赵其民、兰文兆、张万和、李光勋、沈图、曾绍东等。到机场欢迎的还有我援缅专家刘逸烈士的家属刘亚芸和其他援缅专家和技术人员在京的亲属。
    红色援缅专家和技术人员今天上午离开昆明时，革命群众、中国人民解放军驻昆明部队指战员、红卫兵小将，以及有关方面负责人，前往机场送行。
