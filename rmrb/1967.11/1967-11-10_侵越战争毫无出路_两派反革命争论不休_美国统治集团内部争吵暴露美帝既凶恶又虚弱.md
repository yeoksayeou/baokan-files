According to a Xinhua News Agency report, our correspondent reports: Recently, within the U.S. imperialist ruling clique, a new round of intense arguments and mutual accusations has erupted over the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This argument clearly reflects the U.S. imperialists' desperate and embarrassing situation on the Vietnam battlefield after suffering repeated defeats.

The current argument within the U.S. imperialist ruling clique is mainly about how to get out of the Vietnam quagmire—whether to continue escalating the war or to once again plot a "bombing halt and deception" scheme. However, the fundamental issue it reflects is much deeper than this dispute over methods and tactics of aggression in Vietnam.

The continuous failures of the Vietnam War have exacerbated various contradictions within and outside the U.S., making the difficulties unprecedentedly severe. Internationally, it has been isolated more than ever, and its global counter-revolutionary strategy has been disrupted. Domestically, the increasingly massive Vietnam War expenses and military preparations have drained the finances and economy, leaving it riddled with crises; class contradictions have intensified. The growing anti-Vietnam War movement and armed resistance by African Americans in the U.S. seriously threaten the reactionary rule of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class.

Under these circumstances, the infighting between the so-called "hawks" and "doves" within the U.S. ruling clique, as propagated by bourgeois newspapers, has escalated, making the Johnson administration, which suffered a humiliating defeat in Vietnam, the center of the argument.

In this infighting within the U.S. ruling clique, the representatives of the "hawks" desperately advocate for a last-ditch struggle to save their doomed fate in Vietnam. They demand more troops in South Vietnam, more intense bombing of the North, and even the blockade of Haiphong port. They advocate that without these measures, U.S. "military efforts" will be damaged, and U.S. troops will suffer even more severe casualties. They shout for "more people, more weapons, and more (bombing) targets" to "conduct unlimited war."

However, the tragedy of these "hawks" is that their cries, though loud, lack the power to soar. The Vietnam War has repeatedly proven that continuing to escalate the war will inevitably lead to greater difficulties for U.S. imperialism in terms of manpower, finances, and resources, and will further expose its fatal strategic weaknesses. Even these "hawks" have to admit that U.S. war escalations have always backfired.

In contrast, the representatives of the so-called "doves," who play another counter-revolutionary strategy, believe that the strategy of gradual escalation will not bring victory to the U.S. but will instead expose it to greater risks. They anxiously emphasize that this war, which offers "no real hope," has diverted U.S. attention from other trouble spots in the world and has dispersed U.S. capabilities to solve domestic problems. These people are particularly concerned that the U.S.'s unlimited escalation will lead to a head-on collision with China, and fighting China would be "extremely irresponsible."

These so-called "doves" advocate for the U.S. to once again play the "bombing halt and deception" trick and propose various "bombing halt" schemes, attempting to force the Vietnamese people into "negotiations" with U.S. aggressors. However, these "doves" also have to admit that the heroic Vietnamese people are determined to fight to the end, and no "negotiation" tricks will succeed.

Regardless of how intense the arguments within the U.S. imperialist ruling clique are over the methods and tactics of aggression in Vietnam, their ultimate goal is to maintain the interests of the U.S. monopoly capitalist class. Their purposes of aggression are completely consistent. The current infighting is merely an admission that the U.S. imperialists' counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy has further failed and collapsed, and that the U.S. aggression in Vietnam is in a desperate, no-way-out situation.

Historical practice has repeatedly shown that the U.S. "hawks'" ferocious war cries and desperate struggles do not indicate U.S. strength; the "doves'" sweet "negotiation" tunes do not indicate U.S. wisdom. The louder their war cries and the higher their "negotiation" tunes, the more they expose the U.S. imperialists' aggressive nature, the more they indicate the U.S. imperialists' weakness, and the more they show that the U.S. is facing greater failures and difficulties.

    侵越战争毫无出路　两派反革命争论不休
    美国统治集团内部争吵暴露美帝既凶恶又虚弱
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：最近，在美帝国主义统治集团内部，围绕着美国侵略越南的战争，爆发了一场新的激烈争吵和互相攻讦。这场争吵明显地反映了美帝国主义统治集团在侵越战场上连遭惨败之后进退两难的狼狈处境。
    美帝国主义统治集团内部当前的这场争吵，主要是围绕着如何才能摆脱侵越困境——是继续实行战争“升级”呢，还是再一次搞“停炸诱和”的阴谋而展开的。但是，它所反映出来的实质问题，却比这个侵越方式和手段之争，要深刻得多。
    侵越战争的不断失败，使美帝国主义在国内外的各种矛盾发展得空前剧烈，困难空前严重。在国际上，它已经陷于空前的孤立，它的全球反革命战略已经被打乱。在国内，越来越庞大的侵越战费和备战开支把财政、经济拖得百孔千疮，危机四伏；国内的阶级矛盾大大加剧。美国人民日益高涨的反对侵越战争的运动和黑人武力抗暴斗争，严重地威胁着美国垄断资本集团的反动统治。
    在这种情况下，美国统治集团内被资产阶级报刊宣传的“鹰”派与“鸽”派的狗咬狗的争吵越演越烈，使侵越战争遭到惨败的约翰逊政府，成为争吵的中心。
    在美帝统治集团内部的这场争吵中，“鹰”派的代表人物为挽救在侵越战场上灭顶的命运，竭力鼓吹作孤注一掷的绝望挣扎。他们要求向南越更多地增兵，对北方进行更加疯狂的轰炸，甚至封锁海防港口。他们鼓吹说，不这样，就会损害美国的“军事努力”，“使美国军队遭到更严重得多的伤亡”。他们叫嚷要求“更多的人、更多的武器和更多的（轰炸）目标”，以“进行无限制的战争”。
    可是，这些“鹰”们的悲哀之处在于，他们的嚎叫虽响却无力翱翔。越南战争已经一再证明，继续战争“升级”必然使美帝国主义在人力、财力、物力方面面临着更大的困难，并且会使它的各种致命性战略弱点更加暴露。即使这些“鹰”们也不得不承认，美国的战争升级总是适得其反。
    与“鹰”派相对，玩弄另一手反革命战略的所谓“鸽”派的代表人物认为逐步“升级”的战略，不仅不会为美国带来胜利，相反使它承担着更大的风险。他们不安地强调这场“看不到什么真正希望”的战争“使美国转移了对世界其他麻烦地点的注意力，并且分散了美国解决国内问题的能力。”这些人特别担心美国的无限制“升级”会使它与中国“迎头相撞”，而同中国作战则“是极端不负责任的”。
    这些所谓的“鸽”们主张美国再一次玩弄“停炸诱和”的阴谋，并且提出了形形色色的“停炸”方案，妄图诱迫越南人民同美国侵略者“和谈”。但是，这些“鸽”们也不得不承认，英勇的越南人民决心抗战到底，不管什么样的“和谈”阴谋，都是无法得逞的。
    美帝国主义统治集团内部不管在侵略越南的方式和手段上发生怎样激烈的争吵，他们都是为了维护美国垄断资产阶级的利益，他们的侵略目的都是完全一致的。当前这场狗咬狗的争吵，只不过是美帝国主义的反革命两手战略进一步遭到失败、破产，美国侵越战争处于进退维谷、走投无路窘境的一个自供状。
    历史实践已经再三说明，美帝“鹰”派张牙舞爪的战争嚎叫和绝望挣扎，决不表明美帝的强大；“鸽”派娓娓动听的“和谈”曲调，也不表明美帝的“明智”。他们战争嗥叫叫得越响，“和谈”曲调唱得越高，就越能暴露美帝的侵略本质，就越表明美帝国主义的虚弱，表明它的失败和困难越大。
