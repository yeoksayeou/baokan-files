Edition: 1

The Albanian newspapers *Voice of the People* and *Unity* published editorials on November 23 to enthusiastically celebrate the 18th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China, and to hail the great victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The *Voice of the People* noted in its editorial that the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China is a major event in the history of friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries and their peoples. The editorial reviewed in detail the development and strengthening of the friendship and multifaceted fraternal relations between the two countries, their parties, and their governments over the past 18 years. It pointed out that this ever-strengthening and developing friendship is forged by the Marxist-Leninist parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial said that this year, the people of our country are celebrating this memorable great event in the warm atmosphere created by the visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu to China. The indescribably enthusiastic atmosphere in which the delegation was received, the extremely cordial conversations held by the delegation with the great leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, the great friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and with other Party and government leaders of China, are new brilliant manifestations of the eternal internationalist friendship and Marxist-Leninist combat unity between the peoples of Albania and China.

The editorial said, as brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, we are delighted by the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the continuous strengthening and development of the national economy, and in the enhancement of powerful defensive capabilities. The Chinese people are celebrating this great event in the history of friendly relations between the two socialist countries at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is advancing irresistibly and victoriously. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and intellectuals to thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. Now, those Chinese revisionists who attempted to stage a replay of the tragic coup d'Ã©tat by the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the traitor Khrushchev in the Soviet Union have been exposed, dragged out, and thoroughly isolated. Their positions have been fundamentally shaken, and their counter-revolutionary lines have been smashed and routed in all respects. The Albanian people wholeheartedly hail the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our people consider these victories and achievements not only as great victories of the brotherly Chinese people but also as great victories of all revolutionaries in the world. The inspiring great and brilliant examples set by these victories and their profound political influence have struck fear into the hearts of the enemies of revolution and socialism, i.e., the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique in the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries in various countries. No matter how they slander, defame, and plot, they can in no way tarnish the great brilliance of the Marxist-Leninist thought of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, nor can they in any way block the advance of the Chinese giant with a population of 700 million along the road of revolution and socialism, communism.

The editorial stressed that at a time when the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries are threatened by the policy of hegemony pursued by the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, the existence of a powerful and invincible great People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great fortune for the peoples of the world and the international communist movement.

The editorial concluded by saying that today, on the anniversary of this great event in the history of friendship and cooperation between our two peoples and our two socialist countries, the Albanian people extend warm revolutionary greetings to their Chinese brothers.

The editorial in *Unity* said that the Albania-China friendship will last forever because it not only serves the immediate interests of our two peoples, parties, and countries but also serves the interests of the great cause of socialism and communism. The peoples, parties, and countries of Albania and China have been steadfast and unwavering in defending this great cause, safeguarding it from the attacks of the imperialists and the most dangerous and despicable traitors in the history of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, the Khrushchev revisionists. It is precisely for this reason that the imperialists, the Khrushchev revisionists, and all kinds of reactionaries regard our friendship as a thorn in their eyes. They have tried every means to sow discord between our two peoples, to sabotage the unbreakable unity between our two parties, countries, and peoples. But the more they do so, the more solid the friendship and unity between the peoples of Albania and China become, and the stronger the relations and fraternal cooperation between our two countries and parties become.

The editorial said that the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists are now frantically attacking People's China, attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. Relying on their faithful lackeys in Asia and other parts of the world, they are maliciously trying to create a "ring of fire" against the People's Republic of China and to obstruct the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, in an attempt to block the powerful and just voice of 700 million Chinese people in international affairs. It is easy to understand that they are so frantic and hysterical because People's China today has become a powerful pillar of socialism in the world, an insurmountable obstacle to the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to jointly dominate the world, and the most reliable base and defender of the revolutionary forces and the liberation movements of the peoples of various countries. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is advancing victoriously throughout China, is sweeping away all the rubbish of the old world, the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, exposing, striking, and thoroughly smashing a handful of capitalist-roaders, thus turning to ashes the dreams and hopes of the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists to make China degenerate into revisionism and restore capitalism in China.

The editorial pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists are using the most despicable and shameless slanders to attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, in an attempt to deceive the peoples of various countries, first and foremost their own people, and to obstruct the spread of the doctrine, which is of historic significance for all countries under the rule of revisionist cliques today, provided by this revolution. But a sieve cannot hide the sun. The true situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The thought of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gives new courage and strength to all Marxist-Leninists and all true revolutionaries in the world. As the people of our country, who have shared life and death with the great Chinese people and are their brothers and comrades-in-arms, we have always strongly supported and are now supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we are delighted by its victorious advance throughout China. Our people have always steadfastly supported and continue to support the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, regarding it as one of the necessary conditions for the existence of the United Nations itself.

The editorial said that the People's Republic of Albania, under the wise and courageous leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, is advancing victoriously on the road of socialism and revolution. The Albanian Party of Labour, which is forever loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is leading the Albanian people from victory to victory. No matter how barbarically the imperialists and revisionists encircle us, the Albanian Party of Labour, hoisting high the pure banner of Marxism-Leninism, has become an impregnable fortress of socialism and revolution on the Adriatic coast and in Europe, where capitalism and revisionism are rampant. This is the reason why the imperialists and revisionists have plotted and continue to plot against our country in the past. But the Albanian people have never been and will never be intimidated by the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists. The Albanian people are always ready to give them the deserved rebuff. At the same time, the Albanian people are not isolated. They have the great Chinese people of 700 million as their brothers and comrades-in-arms, and they have all the revolutionary peoples of the world as their friends.
