Edition: 1

The Albanian newspapers *Voice of the People* and *Unity* published editorials on November 23 to enthusiastically celebrate the 18th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China, and to hail the great victories achieved in China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The *Voice of the People* noted in its editorial that the establishment of diplomatic relations between Albania and China is a major event in the history of friendship and fraternal cooperation between the two countries and their peoples. The editorial reviewed in detail the development and strengthening of the friendship and multifaceted fraternal relations between the two countries, their parties, and their governments over the past 18 years. It pointed out that this ever-strengthening and developing friendship is forged by the Marxist-Leninist parties led by Comrade Enver Hoxha and Comrade Mao Zedong.

The editorial said that this year, the people of our country are celebrating this memorable great event in the warm atmosphere created by the visit of the Albanian Party and government delegation led by Comrade Mehmet Shehu to China. The indescribably enthusiastic atmosphere in which the delegation was received, the extremely cordial conversations held by the delegation with the great leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party, the great friend of the Albanian people, Comrade Mao Zedong, and with other Party and government leaders of China, are new brilliant manifestations of the eternal internationalist friendship and Marxist-Leninist combat unity between the peoples of Albania and China.

The editorial said, as brothers and comrades-in-arms of the Chinese people, we are delighted by the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in the continuous strengthening and development of the national economy, and in the enhancement of powerful defensive capabilities. The Chinese people are celebrating this great event in the history of friendly relations between the two socialist countries at a time when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Comrade Mao Zedong, is advancing irresistibly and victoriously. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has mobilized hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, soldiers, students, and intellectuals to thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line represented by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party led by China's Khrushchev. Now, those Chinese revisionists who attempted to stage a replay of the tragic coup d'état by the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists led by the traitor Khrushchev in the Soviet Union have been exposed, dragged out, and thoroughly isolated. Their positions have been fundamentally shaken, and their counter-revolutionary lines have been smashed and routed in all respects. The Albanian people wholeheartedly hail the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the brilliant achievements of the Chinese people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Our people consider these victories and achievements not only as great victories of the brotherly Chinese people but also as great victories of all revolutionaries in the world. The inspiring great and brilliant examples set by these victories and their profound political influence have struck fear into the hearts of the enemies of revolution and socialism, i.e., the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists centered around the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique in the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries in various countries. No matter how they slander, defame, and plot, they can in no way tarnish the great brilliance of the Marxist-Leninist thought of the Communist Party of China and Comrade Mao Zedong, nor can they in any way block the advance of the Chinese giant with a population of 700 million along the road of revolution and socialism, communism.

The editorial stressed that at a time when the freedom and independence of the peoples of various countries are threatened by the policy of hegemony pursued by the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, the existence of a powerful and invincible great People's Republic of China and the Communist Party of China, and the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, is a great fortune for the peoples of the world and the international communist movement.

The editorial concluded by saying that today, on the anniversary of this great event in the history of friendship and cooperation between our two peoples and our two socialist countries, the Albanian people extend warm revolutionary greetings to their Chinese brothers.

The editorial in *Unity* said that the Albania-China friendship will last forever because it not only serves the immediate interests of our two peoples, parties, and countries but also serves the interests of the great cause of socialism and communism. The peoples, parties, and countries of Albania and China have been steadfast and unwavering in defending this great cause, safeguarding it from the attacks of the imperialists and the most dangerous and despicable traitors in the history of the international communist movement and the workers' movement, the Khrushchev revisionists. It is precisely for this reason that the imperialists, the Khrushchev revisionists, and all kinds of reactionaries regard our friendship as a thorn in their eyes. They have tried every means to sow discord between our two peoples, to sabotage the unbreakable unity between our two parties, countries, and peoples. But the more they do so, the more solid the friendship and unity between the peoples of Albania and China become, and the stronger the relations and fraternal cooperation between our two countries and parties become.

The editorial said that the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists are now frantically attacking People's China, attacking the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great leader of the Chinese people, the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong. Relying on their faithful lackeys in Asia and other parts of the world, they are maliciously trying to create a "ring of fire" against the People's Republic of China and to obstruct the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, in an attempt to block the powerful and just voice of 700 million Chinese people in international affairs. It is easy to understand that they are so frantic and hysterical because People's China today has become a powerful pillar of socialism in the world, an insurmountable obstacle to the conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to jointly dominate the world, and the most reliable base and defender of the revolutionary forces and the liberation movements of the peoples of various countries. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which is advancing victoriously throughout China, is sweeping away all the rubbish of the old world, the old ideas, culture, customs, and habits of the exploiting classes, exposing, striking, and thoroughly smashing a handful of capitalist-roaders, thus turning to ashes the dreams and hopes of the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists to make China degenerate into revisionism and restore capitalism in China.

The editorial pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists are using the most despicable and shameless slanders to attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and its leader, Comrade Mao Zedong, in an attempt to deceive the peoples of various countries, first and foremost their own people, and to obstruct the spread of the doctrine, which is of historic significance for all countries under the rule of revisionist cliques today, provided by this revolution. But a sieve cannot hide the sun. The true situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is spreading rapidly throughout the world. The thought of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution gives new courage and strength to all Marxist-Leninists and all true revolutionaries in the world. As the people of our country, who have shared life and death with the great Chinese people and are their brothers and comrades-in-arms, we have always strongly supported and are now supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we are delighted by its victorious advance throughout China. Our people have always steadfastly supported and continue to support the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, regarding it as one of the necessary conditions for the existence of the United Nations itself.

The editorial said that the People's Republic of Albania, under the wise and courageous leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, is advancing victoriously on the road of socialism and revolution. The Albanian Party of Labour, which is forever loyal to Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, is leading the Albanian people from victory to victory. No matter how barbarically the imperialists and revisionists encircle us, the Albanian Party of Labour, hoisting high the pure banner of Marxism-Leninism, has become an impregnable fortress of socialism and revolution on the Adriatic coast and in Europe, where capitalism and revisionism are rampant. This is the reason why the imperialists and revisionists have plotted and continue to plot against our country in the past. But the Albanian people have never been and will never be intimidated by the imperialists and the Khrushchev revisionists. The Albanian people are always ready to give them the deserved rebuff. At the same time, the Albanian people are not isolated. They have the great Chinese people of 700 million as their brothers and comrades-in-arms, and they have all the revolutionary peoples of the world as their friends.

    毛泽东同志和霍查同志缔造的中阿战斗友谊牢不可破
    中国无产阶级文化大革命给世界人民新的勇气和力量
    阿《人民之声报》《团结报》分别发表文章热烈庆祝阿中建交十八周年
    新华社地拉那二十五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》和《团结报》二十三日分别发表编辑部文章，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚和中国建交十八周年，并欢呼中国无产阶级文化大革命所取得的伟大胜利。
    《人民之声报》在文章中指出，阿尔巴尼亚和中国之间的外交关系的建立，是两国人民和两国的友谊和兄弟般合作的历史上的一件大事。
    文章详细回顾了十八年来阿中两国人民、两党和两国政府之间的友谊和多方面的兄弟般的关系的发展和加强，并且指出，这种日益加强和发展的友谊，是由以恩维尔·霍查同志和毛泽东同志为首的我们两个马克思列宁主义的党所缔造的。
    文章说，今年，我国人民是在由以穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国所形成的热烈气氛中来庆祝这一使人难忘的大喜事的。
    接待我国代表团的难以形容的热情洋溢的气氛，我国代表团同中国人民和中国共产党的伟大领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大朋友毛泽东同志，以及同中国的其他党政领导人所进行的极其亲切的交谈，是阿中两国人民之间永恒的国际主义友谊和马克思列宁主义的战斗团结的新的光辉体现。
    文章说，作为中国人民的兄弟和战友，我们为中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中、在不断加强和发展国民经济以及在增强强大的防御力量等方面所取得的辉煌胜利，感到欢欣鼓舞。中国人民是在由毛泽东同志亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命势不可挡地和胜利地前进的时刻来庆祝我们两个社会主义国家友好关系史上这件大喜事的。中国的这场无产阶级文化大革命发动了亿万工、农、兵、学生和知识分子，彻底摧毁了以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所代表的资产阶级反动路线。现在，妄图在中国重演以叛徒赫鲁晓夫为首的一小撮反革命修正主义分子在苏联篡政的悲剧的中国修正主义者，被揭露，被揪出来了。他们已被彻底孤立，他们的阵地从根本上被动摇了，他们的反革命阵线已在各方面被粉碎，被击溃了。阿尔巴尼亚人民衷心欢呼毛泽东主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，衷心欢呼中国人民在无产阶级文化大革命中取得的光辉成就。我国人民认为，这些胜利和成就，不仅是兄弟的中国人民的伟大胜利，也是全世界所有革命者的伟大胜利。这些胜利所树立的鼓舞人心的伟大的光辉范例及其深远的政治影响，使革命和社会主义的敌人，即以美国为首的帝国主义者和以勃列日涅夫—柯西金苏联叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者和各国反动派怕得要死。不管他们怎样诬蔑诽谤和玩弄阴谋，都丝毫无损于中国共产党和毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的伟大光辉，也根本阻挡不了拥有七亿人口的中国巨人沿着革命和社会主义、共产主义的道路阔步前进。
    文章强调指出，在各国人民的自由和独立由于美苏两大国推行主宰世界的政策而受到威胁的时刻，世界上有强大的不可战胜的伟大的人民中国和中国共产党，有杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志，这是世界人民和国际共产主义运动的莫大幸福。
    文章最后说，今天，在庆祝我们两国人民和我们两个社会主义国家之间的友谊和合作史上的大喜事的周年之际，阿尔巴尼亚人民向中国兄弟致以热忱的革命敬礼。
    《团结报》的文章说，阿中友谊将永世长存，因为它不仅符合我们两国人民、两党和两国的切身利益，而且也符合社会主义和共产主义的伟大事业的利益。阿中两国人民、两党和两国坚贞不屈和始终不渝地捍卫着这一伟大事业，使其免遭帝国主义者和国际共产主义运动和工人运动史上最危险和最卑鄙的叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的攻击。正是因为这个原因，帝国主义者、赫鲁晓夫修正主义者和一切形形色色的反动派把我们的友谊看作眼中钉。他们施尽一切办法挑拨我们两国人民，破坏我们两党、两国和两国人民牢不可破的团结。但是，他们越是这样干，阿中两国人民之间的友谊和团结就越巩固，我们两国和两党之间的关系和兄弟般合作就越加强。
    文章说，帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者现在疯狂地攻击人民中国，攻击无产阶级文化大革命和中国人民的伟大领袖、杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志。他们依靠他们在亚洲和世界各地的忠实走狗，正在穷凶极恶地企图建立针对中华人民共和国的“火力包围圈”和阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，妄图以此阻挡七亿中国人民对于国际事态的强大的和正义的声音。不难理解，他们所以这样疯狂和歇斯底里大发作，是因为人民中国今天成了世界上社会主义的强大支柱，成了美帝苏修实现共同主宰世界阴谋诡计的不可逾越的强大障碍，成了革命力量和各国人民解放运动的最可靠的根据地和保卫者。正在全中国胜利前进的无产阶级文化大革命，正在清除旧世界的一切垃圾，清除剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗和旧习惯，揭露、打击和正在彻底地摧毁一小撮走资派，从而使帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者妄图使中国蜕变为修正主义和在中国复辟资本主义的梦想和希望化为灰烬。
    文章指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者用最卑鄙无耻的污蔑来攻击无产阶级文化大革命和领导这一革命的毛泽东同志，妄想以此来欺骗各国人民，首先是他们本国的人民，并阻挠人民学习中国人民的光辉榜样起来打倒修正主义者，阻挡这一革命所提供的对目前所有修正主义集团统治的国家来说具有历史意义的学说的传播。但是，筛子遮不住太阳。无产阶级文化大革命的真实情况正在全世界迅速传播。无产阶级文化大革命的思想给予全世界一切马克思列宁主义者和一切真正的革命者以新的勇气和力量。作为伟大中国人民的生死与共的朋友和战友的我国人民，过去和现在都大力支持无产阶级文化大革命，为它在全中国的胜利前进而感到高兴。我国人民过去和现在都坚持不渝地支持恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，把它看作是联合国本身存在的必要条件之一。
    文章说，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明的和勇敢的领导下的阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国正在社会主义和革命的道路上胜利前进。永远忠于马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，领导着阿尔巴尼亚人民从胜利走向胜利。不管帝国主义、修正主义怎样野蛮地包围，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党高举马克思列宁主义纯洁的旗帜，成为在亚得里亚海岸和在资本主义、修正主义泛滥的欧洲的社会主义和革命的坚不可摧的堡垒。这就是帝国主义者和修正主义者过去曾经和现在继续策划反对我国的阴谋的原因所在，但是，阿尔巴尼亚人民过去没有，今后也决不会被帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所吓倒。阿尔巴尼亚人民随时准备着给他们以应有的回击。同时，阿尔巴尼亚人民不是孤立的。他们有伟大的七亿中国人民这样生死与共的朋友，有世界上一切革命人民作为朋友。
