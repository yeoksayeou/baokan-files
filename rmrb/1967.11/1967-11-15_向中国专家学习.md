Every construction site and factory built with Chinese aid in Mali has become a place where the friendship between the two peoples intertwines. During the construction of the Dougabougou Sugar Factory, Chinese experts and Malian workers worked tirelessly through the night. The construction site was illuminated with bright lights and echoed with the roar of machinery. Nearby villagers flocked to witness this moving scene and spontaneously expressed their gratitude to the Chinese experts. The soon-to-be-completed Ségou Textile Factory attracts crowds on its open days (Saturdays), with thousands of visitors coming from various parts of Mali and other West African countries. They all wish Chairman Mao a long life and express their gratitude to the Chinese experts sent by Chairman Mao for their contributions to Mali and Africa's independence.

"Every construction site and factory built with Chinese aid is a school." This is a common saying among many Malian government leaders and the people. After the construction of the Dougabougou Sugar Factory began, a nearby village selected seven or eight young people to work on the site with the Chinese experts. Their relatives urged these young people to learn well from the Chinese experts. This autumn, a young student named Ibrahim Maïga Kéita voluntarily went to a Chinese-aid construction site to work. He said, "Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. I have read Chairman Mao's books and want to work with the Chinese experts to learn concretely how to implement Mao Zedong Thought in action."

    向中国专家学习
    中国援建马里的每个工地、每个工厂都成为两国人民交织友谊的场所。杜加布古糖厂在兴建过程中，中国专家和马里工人挑灯夜战，工地上，灯火辉煌，机器轰鸣。附近村庄的农民成群结队地来观看这一动人场面，情不自禁地向中国专家表示感谢。即将建成的塞古纺织厂，每逢参观日（星期六），厂内厂外好象热闹的集市，成千的参观者，有的来自马里各地，有的来自西非各国，他们都敬祝毛主席万寿无疆，感谢毛主席派来的中国专家为马里和非洲的独立做出的贡献。
      “中国援建的每个工地、每个工厂都是一所学校。”这是许多马里政府领导人和群众常说的话。杜加布古糖厂开始兴建后，附近的一个村庄挑选了七八个青年送到工地上同中国专家一起劳动，他们的亲人叮嘱这些青年要好好向中国专家学习。今年秋天，一个名叫易卜拉欣马·凯塔的青年学生，自动到中国援建的一个工地来参加劳动。他说：“毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，我读了毛主席的书，还要同中国专家一起劳动，从他们身上具体地学习如何把毛泽东思想贯彻到行动中去。”
