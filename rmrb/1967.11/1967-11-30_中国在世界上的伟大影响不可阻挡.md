At this year's session of the United Nations General Assembly, American imperialism, as usual, rallied its followers to pass an illegal resolution to continue depriving China of its lawful rights in the United Nations. This was an expected outcome. The United Nations, under the control of American imperialism, can only do evil.

The annual vote on the so-called "Chinese representation issue" at the United Nations General Assembly has become a periodic exposure of the true nature of the United Nations. China is not only a member state of the United Nations but also one of its founding members. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal representative of the Chinese people and should rightfully enjoy its lawful rights in the United Nations. However, the United States has year after year controlled the United Nations, excluding the People's Republic of China from this international organization and allowing the Kuomintang bandits to occupy China's seat. This situation clearly shows that the United Nations can only act according to the will of the United States; it is merely a tool for the United States to carry out its policy of aggression and war.

At this year's United Nations General Assembly, the United States played its old tricks. It operated the voting machine to unreasonably reject the proposal by Albania, Algeria, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Cuba, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Romania, Syria, and Sudan—twelve countries in total—to immediately restore China's lawful rights and expel the Kuomintang bandits. Instead, it passed the so-called "important issue" proposal by the United States and its lackeys, Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and others, forcing the assembly to treat the issue of restoring China's lawful representation as one that requires a two-thirds majority to decide, just like the issue of admitting new members. The United States' arrogant and unreasonable actions were met with strong opposition and severe condemnation from representatives of countries that uphold justice. No matter how the United States manufactures a false "majority," it cannot hide the fact that its lone-wolf actions are becoming increasingly unpopular. The proposals by Albania, Cambodia, and other countries, which reflect the universal aspirations of the peoples of various countries, although unreasonably rejected, are a powerful exposure of American imperialism.

To obstruct the restoration of China's lawful rights in the United Nations, the United States set up a second line of defense, instructing its puppet states, such as Italy, to revive the proposal to establish a "committee" to study the so-called "Chinese representation issue," which in reality is to bring back the proposal of "two Chinas" and to openly vote in support. This shows that the United States' plot to create "two Chinas" is far from over. However, all these tricks of the United States are doomed to fail.

In this anti-China farce directed by the United States, the Soviet revisionist leadership group performed a particularly despicable act. The Soviet revisionist group, on the one hand, hypocritically expressed "support" for the restoration of China's lawful rights in the United Nations, and on the other hand, issued a large number of anti-China statements, providing the United States and its lackeys with ammunition to attack China. The Soviet revisionist representative even deliberately confused the issue of restoring China's lawful rights with the issue of the German Democratic Republic joining the United Nations as a new member. This is clearly an attempt to support American imperialism's plot to create "two Chinas" in the United Nations. The actions of the Soviet revisionist group once again exposed their treacherous and despicable face of colluding with the United States to oppose China.

American imperialism and its followers have done everything in their power to obstruct the restoration of China's lawful representation in the United Nations, thinking they have succeeded. In reality, this does not harm the Chinese people in the slightest. The United Nations has long been discredited by American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists. To be frank, the United Nations, which is manipulated by the United States, which practices power politics, which has become a political marketplace for the United States and the Soviet Union, and which serves the United States' policy of aggression and war, is not something the Chinese people desire to join.

The People's Republic of China has been excluded from the United Nations for eighteen years, yet our socialist revolution and socialist construction have continued to develop day by day. Especially in the past year and a half, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, and socialist China is stronger than ever before. Its international prestige has reached an unprecedented height. The great thought of Mao Zedong is widely spread throughout the world. Revolutionary people all over the world look to China, the center of the world revolution. No force can stop the People's Republic of China from playing its great role and exerting its influence on the international stage.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The truth of Marxism-Leninism is on our side. The international proletariat is on our side. The oppressed nations and peoples are on our side. More than ninety percent of the world's people are on our side. Our friends are all over the world. We are not afraid of being isolated, nor will we be isolated. We are invincible." All the miserable anti-China elements who try to isolate China with various tricks and conspiracies will find that they are the ones who are truly isolated.

The Chinese people have no demands of the United Nations. The issue is that the peoples of various countries cannot tolerate the situation where the United Nations is monopolized by American imperialism and the Soviet revisionists for long. The United Nations must become a genuine international organization, it must break free from the control of American imperialism, it must correct all its past mistakes, it must undergo thorough reorganization and reform, it must break the power politics it practices, and it must implement the principle of equality among all countries, big or small. If the legitimate demands of the peoples of various countries cannot be realized, then all countries that uphold justice can completely establish a new revolutionary United Nations. The situation where American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist group use the United Nations to wreak havoc will surely come to an end.

    中国在世界上的伟大影响不可阻挡
    本报评论员
    在本届联合国大会上，美帝国主义又照例纠集它的追随者，通过继续剥夺中国在联合国的合法权利的非法决议。这本来是意料中的事情。联合国在美帝国主义的控制之下，是干不出好事来的。
    联合国大会每年一度关于所谓“中国代表权问题”的表决，成了联合国本质的定期的大暴露。中国不仅是联合国的成员国，而且是联合国的创始国之一。中华人民共和国政府是中国人民唯一合法的代表，理所当然地享有在联合国中的合法权利。但是，美国却年复一年地把持着联合国，把中华人民共和国排斥在这个国际组织之外，而让蒋介石匪帮分子窃据着中国的席位。这种情况，最清楚不过地说明，联合国只能按照美国的意旨行事，它不过是美国推行侵略政策和战争政策的一个工具罢了。
    在今年的联合国大会上，美国玩弄的完全是它那一套老手法。它开动表决机器，无理否决了阿尔巴尼亚、阿尔及利亚、柬埔寨、刚果（布）、古巴、几内亚、马里、毛里塔尼亚、巴基斯坦、罗马尼亚、叙利亚、苏丹等十二国要求毫不拖延地恢复中国合法权利、驱逐蒋介石匪帮的提案；而通过了美国及其一帮娄罗日本、泰国、菲律宾之流的所谓“重要问题”的提案，硬要大会把恢复中国合法代表权的问题，作为要由三分之二多数票才能决定的接纳新会员国的问题来处理。美国这种蛮横无理的做法，遭到主持正义的各国代表的强烈反对和严厉谴责。美国不管怎样制造虚假的“多数”，也掩饰不了它的孤断独行已越来越不得人心了。反映了各国人民普遍愿望的阿尔巴尼亚、柬埔寨等国的提案，虽然被无理否决，却是对美帝国主义一个有力的揭露。
    美国为了阻挠恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，还布置第二道防线，指使意大利等仆从国家，把去年被否决了的主张成立一个“委员会”来研究所谓“中国代表权问题”，实际上是要把搞“两个中国”的提案重新端了出来，并公开投票支持。这表明美国搞“两个中国”的阴谋贼心不死。但是，美国的一切这种诡计，都注定是要破产的。
    在美国导演的这出反华丑剧中，苏修领导集团作了十分恶劣的表演。苏修集团一方面假惺惺地表示“支持”恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，另一方面发表大量反华言论，给美国及其仆从提供攻击中国的子弹。苏修代表在发言中还竟然把恢复中国合法权利的问题，别有用心地同德意志民主共和国作为新会员国参加联合国的问题混为一谈。这分明是给美帝国主义在联合国中制造“两个中国”的阴谋张目。苏修集团的做法，再一次暴露出他们联美反华的阴险卑鄙面目。
    美帝国主义及其追随者竭尽其力阻挠恢复中国在联合国中的合法代表权，自以为得计，其实这根本无损于中国人民的一根毫毛。联合国早已被美帝和苏修弄得声誉扫地。老实说，这样一个受美国摆布的联合国，这样一个推行强权政治的联合国，这样一个成为美苏政治交易所的联合国，这样一个为美国侵略政策和战争政策服务的联合国，中国人民并不希罕参加。
    中华人民共和国被排斥在联合国外已经十八年，我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业照样一天天地发展。特别是最近一年多以来无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，社会主义中国比过去任何时候都更加强大了，它的国际威望空前增高。伟大的毛泽东思想在全世界广泛传播。全世界革命人民都向往世界的革命中心中国。任何力量都无法阻挡中华人民共和国在国际舞台上发挥它的伟大作用和影响。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“马克思列宁主义真理在我们一边。国际无产阶级在我们一边。被压迫民族和被压迫人民在我们一边。全世界百分之九十以上的人民大众在我们一边。我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。我们是不可战胜的。”一切反华的可怜虫妄图用各种阴谋诡计来孤立中国，其实真正孤立的只能是他们自己。
    中国人民对联合国一无所求。问题是各国人民决不能容忍联合国由美帝苏修垄断的这种状况长期继续下去。联合国要成为一个名副其实的国际组织，必须摆脱美帝国主义的控制，必须纠正它过去的一切错误，必须进行彻底的改组和改造，必须打破它推行的强权政治，实行大小国家一律平等的原则。如果各国人民的这些正当要求不能实现，那末一切主持正义的国家就完全可以成立一个新的革命的联合国。美帝国主义和苏修集团利用联合国来胡作非为的局面，是终究要结束的。
