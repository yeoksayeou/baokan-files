People's armed forces in various provinces near Saigon frequently launch attacks and are exceptionally active.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hanoi, since the dry season began, the military and civilians in the various provinces near Saigon, the center of the U.S. puppet regime in South Vietnam, have continued to advance, fiercely striking the enemy on all fronts and achieving one victory after another.

In October, the military and civilians of Ninh Thuan and Tien Giang provinces engaged in over a hundred battles with the enemy, eliminating more than 1,300 enemy personnel, including nearly 500 U.S. invaders.

During this period, on the night of October 26, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of Tien Giang Province launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. military communications center in the city of Tien Giang. The attack severely damaged the machinery and equipment of the communications center, destroyed the living quarters of U.S. technical personnel, and killed or wounded nearly 190 U.S. invaders.

The guerrilla forces in this province closely coordinated their actions, continuously attacking the enemy and inflicting heavy casualties.

From October 20 to 31, the guerrilla forces in the northern part of Go Vap District, Gia Dinh Province, launched successive attacks on enemy strongholds, killing, wounding, or capturing more than 400 enemy personnel, including 105 U.S. soldiers. They annihilated an entire enemy company, destroyed ten enemy strongholds and outposts, and shot down three aircraft.

On the night of October 23, the military and civilians of Gia Dinh Province's Go Vap and Hoc Mon Districts simultaneously attacked the enemy's defenses on the 8th and 15th highways and the puppet troops stationed in Dong Thap Thuan Commune. They annihilated an entire enemy company, blew up seven strongholds and outposts, and two bridges.

The guerrilla forces and local troops of Hoc Mon and Go Vap Districts also launched successive attacks on 23 enemy strongholds along the 1st and 8th highways over three nights from October 22 to 24. They eliminated a large number of enemy personnel. In the battle to attack the "strategic hamlet" of Dong Thap Thuan near Hoc Mon Town, the local troops annihilated an entire puppet company.

On the night of October 30 to the early morning of October 31, the People's Liberation Armed Forces of My Tho Province launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. military base in the Phuoc Long area. They killed or wounded 150 U.S. invaders. On the night of November 8 to the early morning of November 9, the People's Liberation Armed Forces in this province ambushed the enemy on the 4th highway in Chau Tho District, annihilating two M-113 armored car platoons and the U.S. soldiers on them. From October 25 to November 8, the military and civilians in this province destroyed 28 enemy vehicles on the 4th highway, including 22 M-113 armored cars.

From October 23 to 30, the military and civilians of Bo Giao District, Tay Ninh Province, eliminated 308 U.S. puppet soldiers.
