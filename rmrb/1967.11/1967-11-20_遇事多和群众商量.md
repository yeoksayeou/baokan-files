Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." This is a great truth.

Knowledge, theory, and talent all come from practice. "Practice, knowledge, and then practice again, knowledge again, this form, repeating endlessly," this is the epistemology of Marxism. The broad revolutionary masses fighting on all fronts are the direct practitioners of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. They are the most intelligent and talented.

Revolutionary cadres, both new and old, bear the heavy responsibility of leading the masses to seize the revolution, promote production, work, and prepare for war. They are the leaders of the masses. To do a good job of leading, to enhance leadership abilities, and fundamentally improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, one must closely connect with the masses, adopt the attitude of a student, learn from the masses, consult with the masses on all matters, and be good at concentrating the wisdom of the masses and summarizing their experiences.

To be detached from the masses is to be detached from the revolution. To be detached from the masses is to undergo a peaceful evolution. Revolutionary cadres must live among the people and maintain the broadest and closest contact with the people at all times. Only in this way can they retain the character of the working people, forever preserve revolutionary youthfulness, and prevent bureaucratism and revisionism.

    遇事多和群众商量
    毛主席最近教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”这是一个伟大真理。
    认识、理论、才能，来源于实践。“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷”，这就是马克思主义的认识论。战斗在各条战线上的广大革命群众，他们是阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三项伟大革命运动的直接实践者。他们是最聪明、最有才能的。
    革命的新、老干部，负有领导群众抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备的重任，是群众的带头人。要做好领导工作，增长领导才干，从根本上改善干群关系，就必须密切联系群众，以小学生的姿态求教于群众，遇事多和群众商量，善于集中群众的智慧，总结群众的经验。
    脱离了群众，就是脱离了革命。脱离了群众，就会和平演变。革命的干部只有深居于群众之中，同人民群众经常保持最广泛、最密切的联系，才能保持劳动人民的本色，才能永葆革命的青春，才能防止官僚主义、修正主义。
