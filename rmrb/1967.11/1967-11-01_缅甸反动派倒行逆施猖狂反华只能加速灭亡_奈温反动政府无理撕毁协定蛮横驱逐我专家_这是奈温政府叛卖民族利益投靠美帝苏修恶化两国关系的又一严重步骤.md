The reactionary clique in Burma, led by Ne Win, is engaging in desperate anti-China actions that will only hasten their doom. The Ne Win reactionary government has arbitrarily torn up the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma and brutally expelled Chinese experts. This is another serious step by the Ne Win government to betray the national interests of Burma, to align with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and to further deteriorate relations between the two countries.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on October 31, the Ne Win reactionary government has reneged on its commitments and unilaterally and completely torn up the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma. In a notice on October 6, it brazenly ordered the expulsion of Chinese experts, arbitrarily demanding that they leave Burma by the end of October. This is another extremely serious step by the Ne Win reactionary government to betray the national interests of Burma, to align with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and to further deteriorate relations between the two countries.

On the night of June 27, the reactionary government in Burma organized thousands of thugs to break into the Economic Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy, which is responsible for executing Chinese aid projects in Burma, and ransacked and burned the office, as well as a large amount of living supplies and other property intended for the use of the experts.

On June 28, a large group of thugs organized by the reactionary government in Burma brutally attacked the Chinese Embassy in broad daylight, killing Chinese expert Liu Yi on the spot and creating an unprecedented bloody incident in the history of international diplomacy.

During these two days, the reactionary government in Burma also organized thugs to repeatedly provoke the Economic Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy, shouting anti-China slogans.

At the same time, under the pretext of "protection," the reactionary government in Burma dispatched a large number of military police to surround the residence of Chinese experts, cutting off their communication with the outside world and brutally restricting their freedom of movement. Even when experts went to their offices or made phone calls, they had to submit a list in advance and obtain approval from the military police. When experts left their residences, they were followed and their numbers were recorded by secret agents. Chinese experts going to the Economic Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon to handle official business were also obstructed in every possible way, and many experts were detained in Rangoon for one or two months, unable to return to the construction sites. The military police also brutally infringed upon the personal freedom of Chinese experts, arbitrarily breaking into their offices and residences, and the military police surrounding the experts' residences pointed their guns at the experts' dormitories, and even at the experts who walked out of the dormitories. All of this made the personal safety of Chinese experts completely unguaranteed and deprived them of the conditions for normal work.

Despite the occurrence of the above series of serious political incidents that made it impossible for Chinese experts to continue working, the Chinese government, in the interests of the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma and the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Asian and African countries, adopted a highly restrained attitude. On June 29, the Chinese government issued a statement, putting forward five solemn demands to the Ne Win government: (1) to severely punish the culprits, (2) to compensate the families of the victims, (3) to make a public apology, (4) to guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy in Burma and other institutions and all Chinese personnel, and (5) to immediately stop the fascist atrocities against overseas Chinese. The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Burma subsequently conducted four months of patient negotiations with the Burmese government. At the same time, Chinese experts continued to stay at various construction sites, awaiting a reasonable solution to the problem.

However, the reactionary government in Burma, ignoring the Chinese government's repeated strong protests and solemn demands, on the one hand, launched wave after wave of anti-China campaigns nationwide, further cruelly and cunningly persecuting the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese; on the other hand, it turned black into white in response to the Chinese government's demands, and shamelessly shifted the blame and evaded responsibility.

In the hope of maintaining the smooth implementation of the economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries and enabling Chinese experts to resume work, the Chinese government, on October 4, again sent a note to the reactionary government in Burma, reiterating the five reasonable demands and urging it to give them serious consideration. However, the reactionary government in Burma, on October 6, brazenly demanded the "immediate withdrawal" of Chinese experts and technicians, and arrogantly stated that the Burmese government would "no longer be responsible for their living expenses" after October 31, 1967, effectively expelling Chinese experts and unilaterally and completely tearing up the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma.

The Ne Win reactionary government's betrayal of the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma is an important part of its long-planned anti-China conspiracy. The economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma was signed in 1961. After the Ne Win clique came to power in a military coup in March 1962, in order to gain economic benefits, it actively requested the continuation of the agreement. After the Chinese government agreed to this request in the interests of promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Burma and helping the Burmese people to carry out economic construction and get rid of dependence on imperialism, it repeatedly unilaterally changed the agreed-upon aid projects and delayed the preparation work for related projects, sabotaging the smooth implementation of the agreement. With the efforts of the Chinese side, the Chinese experts assisting Burma worked selflessly and cooperated closely with the Burmese workers to build the Hprong Bridge and the Myaing Sugar Factory, to complete the trial operation of the Pyinmana Textile Mill, and to install machinery for the Shwebo Paper Mill, which is under construction, and to expand the self-sufficient power station requested by the Burmese side. In addition, the Taik Cha Bridge and the Swa Saw Wood Factory are in the later stages of construction, and another large-scale hydropower station project is under design and survey. The high quality and speed of the Chinese-aided projects, especially the Chinese experts armed with Mao Zedong Thought, with their hard work, diligence, bravery, and excellent qualities of sharing weal and woe with Burmese workers, have won the praise of the Burmese people.

However, the Ne Win reactionary government has done everything in its power to sabotage the deep friendship between Chinese experts and the Burmese people. It strictly forbade Chinese experts from contacting and associating with the Burmese people, dispatched a large number of secret agents to various construction sites to conduct investigations and surveillance, and even set up barbed wire around the experts' residences, effectively imprisoning the Chinese experts. The Burmese reactionaries also shamelessly colluded with the Kuomintang agents to persecute Chinese experts and carried out sabotage activities on the construction sites.

After the Burmese fascist leader Ne Win visited the United States and conspired with Johnson against China last September, the reactionary government in Burma gradually took the road of openly and brazenly opposing China, and its hatred and persecution of Chinese experts became more pronounced. In April of this year, after a Chinese expert was seriously injured and more than ten Chinese experts were injured in a car accident while going out from the Swa Saw Wood Factory construction site, the Burmese reactionary government paid no attention to this unfortunate incident. The day after the burial of the deceased Chinese expert, the Burmese reactionary government arrogantly demanded the exhumation and relocation of the grave. After the injured Chinese experts were admitted to the hospital, they did not even receive medical treatment, and even the food that Chinese experts ate in the hospital was provided by local overseas Chinese, and so on.

The Ne Win reactionary government in Burma has betrayed its commitments, engaged in brazen anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and torn up the economic and technical cooperation agreement between China and Burma. Its guilt is incontestable, and its attempt to sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is doomed to fail. Its desperate actions will only backfire, provoking even more intense resistance from the Burmese people, and thus hastening its own doom.

    缅甸反动派倒行逆施猖狂反华只能加速灭亡
    奈温反动政府无理撕毁协定蛮横驱逐我专家
    这是奈温政府叛卖民族利益投靠美帝苏修恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤
    据新华社三十一日讯　本社记者报道：缅甸奈温反动政府背信弃义，片面彻底撕毁了中缅两国经济技术合作协定，在十月六日的来照中悍然驱逐中国专家，蛮横无理地限令他们在十月份内全部撤出缅甸。这是奈温反动政府叛卖缅甸民族利益，投靠美帝苏修，破坏中缅两国人民的传统友谊，进一步恶化两国关系的又一个极其严重的步骤。
    六月二十七日凌晨，缅甸反动政府组织上千名暴徒，破门冲进中国援缅工程的执行机构——中国大使馆经济参赞处，把这一机构捣毁，并且抢劫烧毁供专家使用的大批生活物资及其他财物。
    六月二十八日，缅甸反动政府组织的大批暴徒在光天化日之下野蛮袭击中国大使馆，当场杀害中国专家刘逸，造成了国际外交史上空前未有的血腥惨案。
    在这两天中，缅甸反动政府还连续多次组织暴徒在中国大使馆经济参赞处驻地挑衅，嘶叫反华口号。
    与此同时，缅甸反动政府以“保护”为名，派遣大批军警包围中国专家住地，切断专家同外界的联系，粗暴地限制专家的行动自由。甚至专家去办公室和打电话时，也要事先提出名单，经军警批准。专家离开住地，就有特务跟踪、登记人数。中国专家到仰光中国大使馆经济参赞处接洽公务，也受到百般阻挠，许多专家被扣留在仰光达一、二月之久，不能返回工地。缅甸军警还粗暴地侵犯中国专家的人身自由，擅自破门闯入专家的办公室、住地，包围专家住地的军警把枪口朝着专家宿舍站岗，甚至把枪口对着走出宿舍的中国专家。这一切，就使中国专家的人身安全毫无保障，完全失去了正常工作的条件。
    尽管发生了以上这一系列严重政治事件，使得中国专家根本不可能继续工作，中国政府仍然以中缅两国人民的友谊为重，以亚非各国人民团结反帝的事业为重，采取了十分克制的态度。中国政府在六月二十九日发表声明，向奈温政府提出五项严正要求：（一）严惩凶手，（二）抚恤受难家属，（三）公开道歉，（四）保证中国驻缅甸大使馆和其他机构及全体中国人员的安全，（五）立即停止对华侨的法西斯暴行。中国政府和中国驻缅甸大使馆随后耐心地同缅甸政府进行了四个月的交涉。同时，中国专家继续留在各个工地，等待问题得到合理的解决。
    但是，缅甸反动政府不顾中国政府的多次强烈抗议和严正要求，它一方面在全国范围内接二连三地掀起反华浪潮，更加残酷阴险地迫害广大爱国华侨；另一方面则对中国政府的要求极尽颠倒是非之能事，而且百般抵赖，推卸罪责。
    中国政府本着维护两国经济技术合作协定的顺利执行、使中国专家恢复工作的愿望，又在十月四日照会缅甸反动政府，重申五项正当合理的要求，敦促它认真考虑。但是，缅甸反动政府却在六日悍然要求“立刻开始撤退”中国专家和技术人员，并且蛮横地说什么在一九六七年十月三十一日以后缅甸政府将“不再负责他们的生活费用”，实际上是限期驱逐中国专家，这就片面彻底撕毁了中缅两国经济技术合作协定。
    奈温反动政府背信弃义地撕毁中缅两国经济技术合作协定，是它经过长期周密策划的反华阴谋的一个重要组成部分。中缅经济技术合作协定是在一九六一年签订的。奈温集团在一九六二年三月靠军事政变上台后，为了捞取经济实惠，主动要求继续执行协定。中国政府从促进中缅两国人民的友谊，帮助缅甸人民进行经济建设，以摆脱对帝国主义的依赖出发同意这一要求后，它又不断片面变更预定的援助项目，拖延有关项目的准备工作，破坏协定的顺利执行。在中国方面的努力下，援缅的中国专家忘我劳动，同缅甸劳动人民亲密协作，才又快又好地建成了滚弄大桥、米邻糖厂，把密铁拉纺织厂建成投入试生产，另一援缅工程雪当纸厂也在安装机器，正在增建缅方要求的自备电站。还有太可桥、斯瓦胶合板厂两项工程已进入工程后期，另一大型水电站工程正在进行设计勘察。中国经援工程的高质量和高速度，特别是用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国专家，以他们的艰苦奋斗、勤劳勇敢、和缅甸工人同甘共苦的优良品德，博得了缅甸劳动人民的赞扬。
    但是，奈温反动政府却百般破坏中国专家和缅甸人民所结下的深厚友谊。它严格禁止中国专家同缅甸人民接触来往，派出大批特务到各工地上进行调查和监视，甚至在专家住处设置铁丝网，变相地把中国专家加以囚禁。缅甸反动派还无耻地勾结蒋帮特务，迫害中国专家，在工地上进行破坏活动。
    在缅甸的法西斯头目奈温去年九月访问美国同约翰逊密谋反华以后，缅甸反动政府就逐步走上了公开猖狂反华的道路，它对中国专家的仇视和迫害也就表现得更加突出了。今年四月间，在斯瓦胶合板厂工地的中国专家外出发生撞车事故后，有一名中国专家重伤牺牲，十多名中国专家受伤，缅甸反动政府对这一不幸事件根本不予理会。牺牲的中国专家安葬后的第二天，缅甸反动政府竟蛮横地要求扒坟移墓。中国受伤专家进入医院后，连医药也没有，甚至中国专家在医院吃的饭也是由当地华侨供给，等等。
    缅甸奈温反动政府背信弃义，猖狂反华排华，撕毁中缅两国经济技术合作协定的罪责难逃，它妄图破坏中缅两国人民的传统友谊的阴谋是决不能得逞的。它的这种倒行逆施，只能搬起石头打自己的脚，激起缅甸人民更加剧烈的反抗，从而加速它的灭亡。
