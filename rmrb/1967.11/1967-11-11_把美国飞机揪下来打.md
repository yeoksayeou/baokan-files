One day, the armed forces department of a certain village in South Vietnam dispatched Hua Jie along with the guerrilla combat duty squad to carry out an air defense duty. When she arrived at the mountain, she had just jumped into the trench when an enemy propeller plane flew over, hovering and reconnoitering above the mountain slope filled with rice and sweet potatoes.

Hua Jie took aim at the enemy plane, preparing to fire. However, after waiting for a long time, the enemy plane still did not come down. She thought, if we don't shoot it down, it will definitely bring a large number of enemy planes to attack the village tomorrow, spreading chemical poisons and destroying the crops. We must find a way to lure it down so that our comrades can shoot it down. Thus, Hua Jie jumped out of the trench and ran on the mountain slope, deliberately exposing herself as a target. The enemy plane, upon seeing someone on the mountain, dove down to strafe. Hua Jie quickly jumped back into the trench. The entire squad opened fire together, and the enemy plane was hit, wobbled for a moment, and then crashed onto a mountain.

    把美国飞机揪下来打
    一天，南越某乡武装部派花姐同游击队战斗值班小组一起去执行防空值班任务。她走到山上时，刚刚跳进工事，就有一架螺旋桨式的敌机飞过来，在种满稻子和红薯的山坡上空盘旋侦察。
    花姐瞄准这架敌机，作好射击准备。但是等了很久，敌机老也不飞下来。她想，如果不把它揍下来，它明天一定带来大批敌机袭击村庄，撒放化学毒药，破坏庄稼。一定要想办法把它揪下来让兄弟们打。于是花姐便跳出工事在山坡上奔跑，故意暴露目标。敌机发现山上有人，便俯冲下来扫射。花姐迅速跳进工事。全组同志一齐开火，敌机中弹，摇摆了一会便坠落在一座山上。
