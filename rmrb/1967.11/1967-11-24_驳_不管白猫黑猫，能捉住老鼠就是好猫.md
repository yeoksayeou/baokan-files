Refuting "It Doesn't Matter If It's a White Cat or a Black Cat, As Long As It Can Catch Mice"

	Mountain East County, Shandong Province, Xiagang Commune, Dongshuangda Village, Ma Yumei

During the three years of difficulty, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, along with the Chinese Khrushchev, loudly advocated individual farming and put forward the fallacy of "It doesn't matter if it's a white cat or a black cat, as long as it can catch mice." They attempted to make us disregard whether we are following the socialist path or the capitalist path, whether it is the dictatorship of the proletariat or the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, whether it is the poor and lower-middle peasants who are in charge or whether the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements are in power. They only cared about whether production could be developed. In this way, they could freely use the banner of "developing production" to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism.

Under the black orders of these two biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, at that time, in many places, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, together with the ghosts and snakes in society, launched a fierce attack on socialism. In 1962, our commune also experienced a wave of individual farming. Some land was distributed to individual households. As a result, not only was production not good, but it also severely struck the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, benefiting the class enemies. We poor and lower-middle peasants have a weak foundation, few belongings, and some have family members in the army or working as cadres, so naturally, our labor force is not as strong as that of the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. Individual farming is difficult, and life is not guaranteed. The fifth team had a female commune member whose husband died, leaving her with five children, the oldest being only fourteen. The family had no labor force, so the land was abandoned. Before the New Year, their grain ration was exhausted. However, those landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, relying on their abundant labor force, many tools, and their ability to speculate and run small businesses, built one brick house after another. It is clear that the theory of "not caring about white cats or black cats" put forward by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is to let the ghosts and snakes rebel and let these "white cats" and "black cats" come out again to oppress the poor and lower-middle peasants!

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party also said, "Contracting production to households, responsibility to households, distributing land to households... can allow more people to directly participate in production." He also loudly shouted, "Make the illegal legal." This fully exposed his counter-revolutionary nature. If the individual farming wind blown by the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements is made legal, then the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants opposing individual farming and insisting on socialism would not be "legal"? Would the collectivization path not be "legal"? This is not to destroy the people's communes and make the countryside return to the old society where people eat each other?

The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party also said, "A considerable number of peasants demand the distribution of land... peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy." This is a vicious slander. Facts are the best answer. We poor and lower-middle peasants do not want individual farming; we want to firmly walk the path of collectivization! The individual farming black wind blown by the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party was firmly resisted by us, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. Take my sixth small team as an example. At that time, some bad elements in the commune kept urging us to distribute the land to households, but we poor and lower-middle peasants firmly resisted. We held a meeting of poor and lower-middle peasants, and not a single person agreed to distribute the land. We said, distributing the land is to walk the old road of individual farming. We have had enough of the bitterness of the old society! It is Chairman Mao who saved us poor and lower-middle peasants. With Chairman Mao, we have happiness. Chairman Mao's call, we poor and lower-middle peasants will carry out a thousand times, ten thousand times. We poor and lower-middle peasants respond to Chairman Mao's call and walk the path of collectivization. This life, we have decided to walk it, and we will walk it forever. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party wants us poor and lower-middle peasants to dismantle the collectivization stage, engage in individual farming, and let the poor suffer again. That is just a dream! We in the sixth team firmly resisted the perverse wind of "three selfs and one contract" and insisted on walking the path of collectivization. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party said that "peasants have lost confidence in the collective economy," which is looking down on people with dog eyes!

This year, we encountered a pest disaster, but we still produced twenty million more pounds of grain than last year. Why is this? This is because we listened to Chairman Mao's words, demonstrated the superiority of collectivization, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members for collective labor. Through more than a year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have seen clearly what the Chinese Khrushchev and the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party are! We must resolutely overthrow all capitalist "white cats" and "black cats" and forever follow the great leader Chairman Mao, walking the socialist path!

    驳“不管白猫黑猫，能捉住老鼠就是好猫”
    山东莱西县夏格庄公社东双山大队　马玉梅
    三年困难时期，党内另一个最大的走资派同中国赫鲁晓夫一唱一和，大肆鼓吹单干，抛出了“不管白猫黑猫，能捉住老鼠就是好猫”的谬论，妄图使我们根本不管走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路，是无产阶级专政还是资产阶级专政，是贫下中农当家作主，还是地、富、反、坏分子上台，而只注意能不能发展生产。这样，他就可以通行无阻地在“发展生产”的旗号下，实现复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    就在这两个党内最大的走资派的黑号令下，当时不少地区一小撮党内走资派伙同社会上的牛鬼蛇神，向社会主义猖狂进攻。一九六二年，我们公社也刮起了一阵单干风，部分土地分到了户。结果，不但生产搞不好，还严重地打击了广大贫下中农，便宜了阶级敌人。俺们贫下中农底子薄，家具少，又有人参军，当干部，劳动力自然不如地、富、反、坏分子足，单干生产困难多，生活就无法保障。五队有一个女社员，丈夫死了，拖着五个孩子，最大的才十四岁，一家人没劳力，地自然荒了，还没过年，口粮就吃光了。可是那些地、富、反、坏分子，仗着他们劳力足，工具多，又会投机倒把，跑小买卖，瓦房又一座座盖起来了。十分明显，党内另一个最大的走资派的不管“白猫”、“黑猫”的“理论”，就是要让牛鬼蛇神翻天，让这些“白猫”、“黑猫”重新钻出来专贫下中农的政！
    党内另一个最大的走资派还胡说什么“包产到户，责任到户，分田到户……就可以有更多的人去直接参加生产了。”并且大肆叫嚷什么“不合法的使它合法起来”。这就充分暴露了他的反革命本质。既然使地、富、反、坏刮的单干风合法起来，那么广大贫下中农反对单干、坚持社会主义不就是“不合法”了吗？集体化道路不就是“不合法”了吗？这不是要搞垮人民公社，使农村又回到人吃人的旧社会又是什么？
    党内另一个最大的走资派还胡说什么：“相当多的农民要求分配土地……农民对集体经济丧失了信心。”这真是恶毒的诬蔑。事实是最好的回答。我们贫下中农就是不愿单干，就是要坚定不移地走集体化的道路！中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派刮起的单干黑风，受到了我们广大贫下中农的坚决抵制。就拿我所在的六小队来说吧，当时公社的一些坏家伙一个劲地要我们把土地分配到户，俺们贫下中农坚决顶住了。俺们召开了贫下中农会议，会上没有一个同意把土地下放的。俺们说，把土地下放，不就是走单干的老路吗？旧社会的黄连苦俺们尝够了！是毛主席他老人家救了俺贫下中农，有了毛主席，才有俺们贫下中农的幸福。毛主席他老人家的号召，俺们贫下中农一千个照办，一万个照办。俺们贫下中农响应毛主席的号召，走集体化道路，这一辈子算走定了，永远走定了。党内另一个最大的走资派要俺们贫下中农拆集体化的台，搞单干，再让穷人受二茬罪，那是做梦！俺们六队硬是顶住了“三自一包”的歪风，坚持了走集体化道路。党内另一个最大的走资派胡说“农民对集体经济丧失了信心”，那是狗眼看人低！
    俺们今年遇到了虫灾，可是却比去年多打了二十万斤粮食。这是为什么？这是听了毛主席的话，发挥了集体化的优越性，发挥了广大社员的集体劳动的积极性的结果。通过一年多的无产阶级文化大革命，俺们更认清了中国赫鲁晓夫和党内另一个最大的走资派到底是什么东西！俺们一定要坚决把一切资本主义的“白猫”、“黑猫”统统打翻在地，永远跟着伟大统帅毛主席，走社会主义阳关大道！　（东军红整理）
