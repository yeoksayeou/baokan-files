The revolutionary people of Mali are eagerly studying the works of Chairman Mao.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, the people of Mali love the brilliant works of Chairman Mao. More and more Malian workers, peasants, students, youth, and employees are infinitely loving Chairman Mao and are eagerly studying the brilliant works and boundless thoughts of Mao Zedong.

Today, in Bamako or in other parts of Mali, one often encounters Malians with "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in their pockets, with the red edges of the book peeking out. Whether in a theater or a stadium, one can see Malians taking out "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from their pockets and reading it attentively. At some meetings or discussions, or in casual conversations among friends, some Malian friends can recite passages from Chairman Mao's quotations from memory. They regard Chairman Mao's words as their guide to action and struggle, and as a powerful force inspiring them to move forward.

A Malian friend named Dembele traveled over a hundred kilometers to visit the residence of Chinese friends specifically to obtain "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other works by Chairman Mao. After receiving Chairman Mao's works, he excitedly said: "Today I am truly happy. I have long hoped to obtain 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' and the works of Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, a genius of humanity. Can you imagine living in today's world without Chairman Mao's books? How can one do without a correct ideological guidance? Marx, Engels, and Lenin are also great revolutionary leaders, but what Chairman Mao says are the most realistic and important things of our time, easier to understand, and more relevant."

In a courtyard in Bamako city, built in the style of Malian national architecture, some young people gather every afternoon or evening to read Chairman Mao's books. Once, a reporter saw these young people studying the section on patriotism and internationalism in "Quotations from Chairman Mao." After reading, they engaged in a heated discussion. A young man named Diop said: "After reading these passages from Chairman Mao's quotations, we understand better why the Chinese experts in Mali love the Malian people so much and treat the construction of Mali as if it were a project of the Chinese people. It turns out they are working and helping us according to Chairman Mao's teachings."

On another occasion, a Malian friend who was ill jumped up in joy upon receiving a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao." He repeatedly said: "Excellent, excellent, I have been eagerly awaiting this precious book. The relationship between revolution and Mao Zedong Thought is like that between a tree trunk and its sap. A tree without sap in its trunk will die, and a revolution without Mao Zedong Thought cannot proceed."

    干革命靠的是毛泽东思想
    马里革命人民如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作
    据新华社讯　马里人民热爱毛主席的光辉著作，越来越多的马里工人、农民、学生、青年和职员无限热爱毛主席，如饥似渴地学习毛主席的光辉著作和光焰无际的毛泽东思想。
    今天，在巴马科或者在马里的其他地方，人们经常遇见马里人口袋里装着《毛主席语录》，红彤彤的书边露在口袋外边。不论是在剧场或体育场，人们可以看到马里人民常常从口袋里掏出《毛主席语录》来用心地阅读。在一些会议上或讨论会上，在朋友之间的闲谈中，有些马里朋友随口就能背诵出成段的毛主席语录。他们把毛主席的话看成是他们行动和斗争的指南，当作鼓舞他们前进的强大力量。
    一位名叫当贝莱的马里朋友，为了寻找《毛主席语录》和毛主席的其他著作，专程跑了一百多公里路，来到中国朋友的住所。当他得到了毛主席的著作之后，兴奋地说：“今天我真幸福，我很久以来就希望得到《毛主席语录》和毛主席的著作了。毛主席是当代最伟大的革命领袖，是人类的天才。你想，生活在今天的世界上，没有毛主席的书怎么行？没有一个正确的思想指导怎么行？马克思、恩格斯、列宁也是伟大的革命领袖，但毛主席所说的都是当代最现实最重要的东西，更容易理解，更有现实意义。”
    在巴马科城内一座马里民族形式的庭院里，每天下午或晚上都有些青年来这里聚会，读毛主席的书。一次，记者看见这些青年人正在学习《毛主席语录》中爱国主义和国际主义一节。他们读了以后就热烈地进行讨论。一位叫迪奥普的青年说：我们读了这几段毛主席语录，我们更懂得了在马里的中国专家们为什么那么热爱马里人民，把马里的建设当作中国人民的建设事业一样来进行，原来他们是根据毛主席的教导来工作和帮助我们的。
    又有一次，一位正在病中的马里朋友在得到一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》的时候，高兴得一跃而起，他连声地说：“好极了，好极了，我正盼望得到这本宝书。革命和毛泽东思想的关系，正象树干和树液一样，一棵树如没有树干内的液汁，它就会死去，革命离开了毛泽东思想也就不能进行。”
