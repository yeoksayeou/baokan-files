Comrade Enver Hoxha praises Communist pioneer soldier Fatoi Adhami
Calls on all people to learn from his outstanding qualities of serving the people wholeheartedly
Praises the border troops guarding the front against the Southern Revisionists for bravely carrying out the task of defending the motherland

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, recently replied to a letter from Fatoi Adhami, a young blind man from the Verzeze Agricultural Production Cooperative in Skrapar District. Comrade Hoxha praised his outstanding qualities and revolutionary spirit of following the Party's teachings, bravely overcoming all difficulties, and serving the Party and the people wholeheartedly. He called on all the people of Albania to learn from him.

In his letter, Comrade Hoxha praised Adhami, who, although blind, fights with an iron will and with the Party's feelings, thoughts, and fighting style. He praised him as a pioneer soldier and a banner for everyone.

Comrade Hoxha expressed his belief that Adhami's deeds will further inspire the patriotic and revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people.

Fatoi Adhami is a member of the Verzeze Agricultural Production Cooperative in Skrapar District and a member of the Party of Labour of Albania. Although blind, he never leaves his post. Last year, he completed 381 workdays. After the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, he responded to the Party's great call to increase grain production and achieve self-sufficiency by working even more actively. He goes out early and returns late every day, always taking on the heaviest tasks without complaint. This year, he also worked for two months at the Lushnje-Fier railway construction site and was awarded the title of Shock Worker four times. Recently, he wrote to his most beloved leader, Comrade Hoxha, reporting his production achievements and pledging to continue to strive for the implementation of the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha, to always be a true member of the Party of Labour.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana, on the morning of the 23rd, the great leader of the Albanian people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, received Fatoi Adhami, a young blind man who came to the capital to attend a national meeting of young volunteers, and had an extremely cordial conversation with him.

Comrade Hoxha encouraged Adhami to always advance along the path indicated by the Party. Comrade Hoxha also inquired about Adhami's health and his efforts to learn culture with great determination. When Adhami picked up a pencil and wrote the word "Party" on paper, Comrade Hoxha was very pleased.

Comrade Hoxha said, Fatoi Adhami's communist attitude towards labor has become a model for all working people, especially the youth of the whole country.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tirana, on the 23rd, the beloved leader of the Albanian people, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, Comrade Enver Hoxha, wrote a letter to the Kuçis 619 border troops guarding the front against Titoite revisionism, praising them for faithfully and bravely carrying out the task of defending the motherland. He also praised the unit for honoring the late young volunteer worker Shkuta Vata, who recently sacrificed his life at the Lushnje-Fier railway construction site, as an honorary soldier.

Comrade Hoxha said in his letter: The Party and the people thank you for faithfully and bravely carrying out the patriotic task of defending the socialist motherland.

The Kuçis 619 border troops guarding the front against Titoite revisionism recently wrote to Comrade Hoxha saying: In our border troops, there is a conscious iron discipline, but we still need to learn the proletarian simplicity of Shkuta and the young blind man Fatoi Adhami, learn their fearless revolutionary spirit and the noble quality of subordinating personal interests to the interests of the Party, the people, and the whole country, learn their sense of responsibility and the optimistic spirit of sacrificing everything to achieve victory.

The letter also said: The Yugoslav revisionists are our sworn enemies. They have already and will always receive the brave blows of our Party, people, and border army. Their sinister plans will never succeed.

According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch, the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania on the 16th issued a special decision to posthumously recognize Shkuta Vata, a young woman who sacrificed her life while volunteering at the Lushnje-Fier railway construction site, as a member of the Party of Labour.

Shkuta Vata is a 15-year-old girl from Shkodër District. She recently sacrificed her life while volunteering at the construction site of the Lushnje-Fier railway.
