	Xinhua News Agency, November 1st: Algerian Ambassador to China, Sahli, held a reception tonight to celebrate the 13th anniversary of the Algerian Revolution. Ambassador Sahli and Vice Premier Li Fuchun of the State Council both spoke at the reception, expressing their shared wish for the continuous development of friendship between the peoples of China and Algeria.

	In his speech, Ambassador Sahli introduced the history of the Algerian people's struggle for national liberation and elaborated on Algeria's foreign policy. He strongly condemned Israel's aggression against Arab countries with the support of American imperialism. He said that Algeria regards Israel as a bridgehead of American imperialism in the Middle East, and that American imperialism, in its desperate struggle to halt the march of history, has exposed its aggressive nature everywhere in the world. Algeria will forever stand by the side of its Arab brothers. In his speech, the ambassador also condemned American imperialism's aggressive war in Vietnam. He said that with the support of the people and progressive forces of the world, the Vietnamese people will surely achieve victory. Algeria will continue to fully support the struggle for national liberation in South Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

	Ambassador Sahli said that the Algerian people have always closely followed the great, brave, and revolutionary efforts of the Chinese people in their struggle to conquer nature, transform society, and transform humanity. He wished the Chinese people greater achievements and hoped that the cooperative relationship between the peoples of Algeria and China would continue to develop.

	Vice Premier Li Fuchun spoke at the reception, praising Algeria for achieving independence through the armed revolutionary struggle of its people.

	Vice Premier Li Fuchun strongly condemned the American and British imperialists for directing Israel to launch a large-scale armed invasion in June this year to suppress the revolutionary struggle of the Arab peoples for complete liberation. He pointed out that the Arab countries and peoples are suffering. He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'The oppressed peoples and oppressed nations must not pin their hopes for liberation on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle.' Imperialism seems formidable, but the truly powerful are not the American aggressors and all their accomplices and running dogs, but the peoples of the Arab countries." He expressed his firm belief that one day, the peoples of the Arab countries will drive out the enemy. He said, "The Chinese people firmly support the just struggle of the peoples of the Arab countries."

	Vice Premier Li Fuchun pointed out that the friendship between China and Algeria, as well as between their peoples, has developed through their common struggle against imperialism. He also wished the Algerian government and people new victories in their great struggle against imperialism's war policy and aggression.

	Envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    李富春副总理在阿尔及利亚驻华大使举行的革命节招待会上说
    中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯人民正义斗争
    萨赫利大使祝愿阿中两国人民合作关系继续发展
    新华社一日讯　阿尔及利亚驻中国大使萨赫利今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝阿尔及利亚革命十三周年。萨赫利大使和国务院副总理李富春，在招待会上先后讲话。他们共祝中阿两国人民之间的友谊不断发展。
    萨赫利大使在讲话中介绍了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族解放斗争的历史，并阐述了阿尔及利亚的对外政策。他强烈谴责以色列在美帝国主义支持下侵略阿拉伯国家的罪恶行为。他说，阿尔及利亚认为以色列是美帝国主义在中东的桥头堡，美帝国主义为了阻止历史的前进，在世界各处暴露了它的绝望挣扎的侵略本性。阿尔及利亚将永远站在兄弟的阿拉伯人民一边。大使在讲话中谴责了美帝国主义在越南所进行的罪恶的侵略战争。他说，在世界人民和进步力量的支持下，越南人民必将获得胜利。阿尔及利亚将永远继续毫无保留地支持越南南方民族解放阵线和越南民主共和国的救国斗争。
    萨赫利大使说，阿尔及利亚人民一直以极大的关心注视着人民中国在征服自然、改造社会和改造人的斗争中所做的巨大的勇敢的和革命的努力。他祝愿中国人民取得越来越大的成绩，祝愿阿尔及利亚和中国两国人民的合作关系继续发展。
    李富春副总理在招待会上讲话，赞扬阿尔及利亚通过人民的武装革命斗争，取得了独立。
    李富春副总理强烈谴责美英帝国主义为了镇压阿拉伯各国人民争取彻底解放的革命斗争，今年六月指使以色列发动了大规模的武装侵略。他指出，阿拉伯国家和人民正在受难。他说，我们伟大的领袖毛泽东主席教导我们：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”帝国主义看来似乎了不起，其实真正强大的不是美国侵略者及其一切帮凶和走狗，而是阿拉伯各国人民。他表示坚信，总有一天，阿拉伯各国人民会把敌人赶出去。他说，中国人民坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民的正义斗争。
    李富春副总理指出，中阿两国以及两国人民之间的友谊，是在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中发展起来的。他还祝愿阿尔及利亚政府和人民在反对帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策的伟大斗争中，取得新的胜利。
    各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
