Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China on the Recall of All Experts and Technical Personnel from Burma

October 31, 1967

In recent months, the Ne Win government of Burma has been frenziedly anti-Chinese and anti-Burmese, committing a series of fascist and bloody atrocities. Now, it has gone back on its word and completely torn up the economic and technical cooperation agreements between the two countries, issuing a note on October 6 demanding that the Chinese government "immediately begin withdrawing all Chinese experts and technical personnel" and stating that "after October 31, 1967, the Burmese government will no longer be responsible for their living expenses." This is another extremely serious step taken by the Ne Win government to betray the national interests of Burma, to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to sabotage the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, and to further deteriorate relations between the two countries. The Chinese people and the Chinese government express great indignation at this and strongly protest against the Ne Win government.

The Chinese experts and technical personnel went to Burma at the invitation of the Burmese government in accordance with the economic and technical cooperation agreements between the two countries. Their mission was to promote friendship between the peoples of the two countries and to help the Burmese people in their economic construction to rid themselves of dependence on imperialism. They followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, sharing the hardships and joys with the Burmese people, working hard, and enthusiastically imparting technical skills and experience to Burmese workers. They have forged deep friendships with the Burmese people and made certain contributions to Burma's economic construction. Some Chinese experts have even sacrificed their precious lives for this. Their spirit of proletarian internationalism has been praised by the Burmese people.

However, in the anti-Chinese and anti-Burmese incidents orchestrated by the Ne Win government, Chinese experts have been brutally murdered, Chinese institutions in Rangoon responsible for aiding Burma have been destroyed, and the living supplies and other belongings of Chinese experts have been looted. The Ne Win government has also repeatedly organized mobs to threaten and provoke Chinese experts on the construction sites, openly insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in front of them; frequently sending military police and secret agents to monitor and restrict the movements of Chinese experts; seizing the offices of Chinese experts on the construction sites; seriously threatening the personal safety of Chinese experts; and maliciously inciting Burmese workers against Chinese experts, even slandering Chinese experts as "spies," attempting to persecute Chinese experts on a larger scale.

Despite the occurrence of the above series of serious political incidents, making it impossible for Chinese experts to continue working, the Chinese government, in the interests of the friendship between the peoples of the two countries and the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Asian and African countries, has adopted a highly restrained attitude. On the day after Chinese experts were brutally murdered, June 29, the Chinese government issued a statement proposing five solemn demands, demanding that the Ne Win government stop anti-Chinese and anti-Burmese activities and stop persecuting Chinese experts. In four months of continuous negotiations, the Chinese government repeatedly reaffirmed these demands. At the same time, Chinese experts, under orders, continued to stay at various construction sites, waiting for the problem to be reasonably resolved before immediately resuming work.

However, the Ne Win government has been obstinate, on the one hand, inciting waves of anti-Chinese sentiment nationwide, more cruelly and cunningly persecuting the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese; on the other hand, completely distorting and slandering the demands of the Chinese government, and shamelessly shifting the blame, issuing repeated notes, turning the serious political incident of frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-Burmese activities and the murder of Chinese experts into an unrelated accidental event, even attempting to shift the responsibility for the failure of aid work to the Chinese side. The Chinese government, in the hope of allowing Chinese experts to resume work as soon as possible, reiterated its position in a note on October 4, reaffirming the five reasonable demands, urging the Ne Win government to seriously consider and quickly respond. It is outrageous that the Ne Win government once again ignored the demands of the Chinese government, demanding on October 6 to expel Chinese experts and ordering them to withdraw from Burma entirely by the end of October. This completely tears up the economic and technical cooperation agreements between the two countries, fully exposing the Ne Win government's persistent anti-Chinese face.

In this situation, the Chinese government now has to announce the recall of all Chinese experts and technical personnel in Burma and strongly condemns the Ne Win government's treacherous and treasonous actions, betraying the interests of the Burmese people and betraying the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Asian and African countries. The Ne Win government must bear full responsibility for its unilateral tearing up of the economic and technical cooperation agreements between the two countries and the expulsion of Chinese experts.

The Chinese government and people will, as always, follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, "The people who have already won the revolution should aid the struggle of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty," to help countries and peoples striving for national independence to completely rid themselves of the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and colonialism, and to build a national economy and contribute their strength.

The Chinese government solemnly points out that the Ne Win government's reckless anti-Chinese actions will not harm a single hair of the Chinese people. The traditional friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is indestructible by any force. The Chinese people will continue to firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people until final victory.

    我国政府最强烈抗议奈温政府驱逐中国专家
    中国专家的国际主义精神得到缅甸人民赞扬
    奈温政府倒行逆施背叛了亚非团结反帝事业
    宣布接回全部专家技术人员，重申支持缅甸人民的革命斗争
    新华社三十一日讯　中华人民共和国政府三十一日发表关于从缅甸接回全部专家和技术人员的声明。全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府关于从缅甸接回全部专家和技术人员的声明
              一九六七年十月三十一日
    几个月来，缅甸奈温政府猖狂反华排华，制造了一连串法西斯血腥暴行。现在，它又背信弃义，彻底撕毁中缅两国经济技术合作协定，于十月六日提出照会，悍然要中国政府“立刻开始撤退所有中国专家和技术人员”，并声称“在一九六七年十月三十一日以后缅甸政府将不再负责他们的生活费用”。这是奈温政府叛卖缅甸民族利益，投靠美帝苏修，破坏中缅两国人民的传统友谊，进一步恶化两国关系的又一个极其严重的步骤。中国人民和中国政府对此表示极大愤慨，并向奈温政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国专家和技术人员，是根据中缅两国经济技术合作协定，应缅甸政府的要求到缅甸去的。他们的任务是促进两国人民友好，帮助缅甸人民进行经济建设，以摆脱对帝国主义的依赖。他们遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，同缅甸人民同甘共苦，辛勤劳动。他们满腔热情地向缅甸工人传授技术和经验，同缅甸人民结下了深厚的友谊，对缅甸的经济建设作出了一定的贡献。有的中国专家还为此献出了宝贵的生命。他们这种无产阶级国际主义精神，得到了缅甸人民的赞扬。
    但是，在奈温政府所策划的反华排华事件中，中国专家惨遭杀害，中国在仰光主持援缅工作的机构被捣毁，中国专家的生活用品和其他财物被抢劫。奈温政府还不断组织暴徒向工地上的中国专家进行威胁和挑衅，公然当着他们的面，侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席；经常派遣军警特务，监视和限制中国专家的行动；强占中国专家的工地办公室；严重威胁中国专家的人身安全；而且还别有用心地煽动缅甸工人反对中国专家，甚至诬蔑中国专家是“间谍”，企图对中国专家进行更大规模的迫害。
    尽管发生了以上这一系列严重政治事件，使得中国专家根本不可能继续工作，中国政府仍然以中缅两国人民的友谊为重，以亚非国家团结反帝的事业为重，采取了十分克制的态度。中国政府在中国专家惨遭杀害的第二天，即六月二十九日的声明中，提出了五项严正要求，要求奈温政府停止反华排华，停止对中国专家的迫害。在四个月的不断交涉中，中国政府反复重申这些要求。同时，中国专家奉命继续留在各个工地，等待问题一得到合理的解决，就即刻恢复工作。
    但是，奈温政府却一意孤行，它一方面在全国范围内接二连三地掀起反华浪潮，更加残酷阴险地迫害广大爱国华侨；另一方面则对中国政府的要求极尽颠倒是非、歪曲污蔑之能事，而且百般抵赖，推卸罪责，并多次来照，把疯狂反华排华、杀害中国专家的严重政治事件，说成是同两国关系无关的偶然事件，甚至妄图把经援工作无法进行的责任推到中国方面。中国政府本着为了使中国专家早日恢复工作的愿望，在十月四日的照会中再次阐明自己的立场，重申五项正当合理的要求，敦促奈温政府认真考虑，迅速答复。令人愤慨的是，奈温政府又一次无视中国政府的要求，竟于十月六日复照公然要驱逐中国专家，并且限令他们在十月份内全部撤出缅甸。这样就把两国的经济技术合作协定撕毁净尽，就完全暴露了奈温政府坚持反华的狰狞面目。
    在这种情况下，中国政府现在不得不宣布，接回中国在缅甸的全部专家和技术人员，并强烈谴责奈温政府这种背信弃义，背叛缅甸人民的利益，背叛亚非国家团结反帝事业的罪恶行径。奈温政府必须对它片面撕毁两国经济技术合作协定、驱逐中国专家的这一行动，承担全部责任。
    中国政府和中国人民，将一如既往，遵循伟大领袖毛主席关于“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务”的教导，为帮助正在努力争取民族独立的国家和人民，彻底摆脱帝国主义和殖民主义的剥削和压迫，建立民族经济而贡献自己的力量。
    中国政府严正指出，奈温政府这样倒行逆施，猖狂反华，损害不了中国人民的一根毫毛。中缅两国人民的传统友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。中国人民将继续坚决支持缅甸人民的革命斗争，直到最后胜利。
