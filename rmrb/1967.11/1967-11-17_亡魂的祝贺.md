Title: Greetings from a Spirit

Fifty years ago, the October Revolution in Russia swept the Kerensky provisional government into the dustbin of history like a storm. The short-lived government's "Premier" Kerensky only escaped with his life by disguising himself as a woman and fleeing the country in a car from the American embassy.

Kerensky, this historical clown, has long since become a political corpse, a spirit, forgotten by all. But on the eve of the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, he suddenly emerged, spouting opinions. What is intriguing is that he did not recount his own bitter history from fifty years ago, but instead praised the Soviet revisionists for not caring about "promoting world revolution" and "rapidly developing towards freedom."

When Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang of traitors shamelessly pose as the successors of the October Revolution, putting on a farce of "commemorating" the fiftieth anniversary of the October Revolution, this Russian counter-revolutionary leader, who once cursed Lenin like a mad dog, sends them words of praise. This is indeed a wonderful irony for Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk!

It is no surprise that the enemies of the October Revolution praise the traitors of the October Revolution. Over the past fifty years, this leader of the Russian provisional government, who was overthrown by the October Revolution, has had countless dreams of reversing the clock of Soviet history. Now, as one foot is in the coffin, he unexpectedly sees that the Soviet revisionist traitors have dragged the Soviet Union back onto the old capitalist road. How could he not be overjoyed and clap his hands in approval?

Fifty years ago, Lenin said: "You Kerenskys... what are you? Are you not 'socialists bred by the bourgeoisie'?" What are Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk today? Are they not also a new batch of 'socialists bred by the bourgeoisie'? Kerensky, this stray dog, fled to the United States, relying on the scraps from the Wall Street bosses to eke out his remaining years. Kosygin and his gang dress up and go to John's feet, shamelessly expressing that visiting the United States is "like going home." If there is any difference between them, it is only that of old slaves and new slaves. The former Russian "Premier" sends greetings and congratulations to the current Soviet revisionist leaders, which clearly shows that the latter are on the same counter-revolutionary ship as the former.

However, the greetings from this political spirit, Kerensky, are indeed an ill omen for Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk. Since this small group of traitors have degenerated into Kerensky-like public enemies, how can they escape the same fate as Kerensky?

    亡魂的祝贺
    万山红
    五十年前的俄国十月革命象一阵狂风暴雨似地把克伦斯基临时政府扫进了历史的垃圾堆。短命的临时政府的“总理”克伦斯基，只是化装成了女人，躲在美国大使馆的汽车里偷越国境，才逃脱了一条狗命。
    克伦斯基这个历史小丑早已成为一具政治僵尸，一个亡魂，被人遗忘了。但是在十月革命五十周年的前夕，他忽然跳了出来，大发议论。耐人寻味的是，他不是追述自己五十年前那一段辛酸历史，而是赞许苏修集团不关心“促进世界革命”；“向自由迅速发展”。
    当勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒们恬不知耻地冒充十月革命继承人，大演所谓“纪念”十月革命五十周年的丑剧时，当年曾象疯狗似地咒骂列宁的这个俄国反革命头子，却向他们发出一片颂扬之声，这对勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，实在是一个极妙的讽刺！
    十月革命的敌人赞美十月革命的叛徒，这是毫不奇怪的。五十年来，这个被十月革命推翻的俄国临时政府头子，不知做过多少次妄想倒拨苏联历史时针的迷梦。到了如今，当他的一只脚跨进了棺材的时候，却意想不到地看到苏修叛徒们已经把苏联拉回到资本主义老路上去，他怎么能不喜出望外地拍手叫好呢？
    列宁在五十年前曾经说过：“你们这些克伦斯基……到底是些什么人呢？难道你们不是‘资产阶级豢养的社会主义者’吗？”今天的勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流到底是些什么人呢？难道不也是一伙新的“资产阶级豢养的社会主义者”吗？克伦斯基这条丧家之犬亡命到了美国，靠着华尔街老板施舍的残羹剩饭度其残年。柯西金之流则梳妆打扮，送上门去，拜倒在约翰逊脚下，无耻地表示访问美国“就象回家一样”。他们两者之间如果有什么不同的话，不过是老奴与新奴之别而已。昨天的俄国“总理”向今天的苏修头目致贺道喜，这不正好说明，后者同前者是坐在同一条反革命黑船上吗？
    不过，克伦斯基这个政治亡魂的祝贺，对于勃列日涅夫、柯西金之辈来说，的确也是一个不祥之兆。既然这一小撮叛徒已经堕落成为克伦斯基一类的人民公敌，他们又怎能逃脱同克伦斯基一样的下场呢？
