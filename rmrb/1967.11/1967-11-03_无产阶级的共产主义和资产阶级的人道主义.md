Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique has been talking a lot about "building communism," no longer saying that communism is "potatoes with beef," but instead saying: "Communism is the embodiment of realistic humanitarianism."

"Embodiment of realistic humanitarianism" seems more refined than "potatoes with beef," and less tempting. However, "embodiment of realistic humanitarianism" is not the scientific communism of the proletariat. It is, like "potatoes with beef," a counterfeit of the bourgeoisie, and thus cannot cover up the ugly face of the Soviet revisionists betraying communism and the path of the October Revolution.

Chairman Mao said: "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat, and at the same time, it is a new social system. This ideological system and social system are distinct from any other ideological system and any other social system. It is the most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational system in the history of mankind."

The communist ideological system is Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the most thorough and complete communist ideological system.

The Soviet revisionist clique has always attempted to "merge" communism with humanitarianism, using humanitarianism to replace communism. They say: "The communist ideological system is the most humanitarian ideological system," "Communist ideology is the most humanitarian ideology." Using the words "most humanitarian" to flatter the communist ideological system is the greatest slander against the communist ideological system. Soviet revisionist gentlemen, you should say "the communist ideological system is the least humanitarian ideological system." Because the communist ideological system is "most" incompatible with the "humanity" of the landlord and bourgeois classes, it is "most" incompatible with your "humanity." Otherwise, why would you fundamentally "revise" it?

The Soviet revisionist clique's fallacy that "communism is the embodiment of realistic humanitarianism" treats humanitarian ideas as primary, and communist institutions as secondary, as something derived from humanitarian ideas. This is typical historical idealism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "There is only specific humanity, not abstract humanity. In class society, there is only humanity with class characteristics, and no such thing as super-class humanity." Therefore, as long as we strip off the abstract cloak of human nature, we can see its reality, that is, its bourgeois nature. What is called abstract humanity is actually real bourgeois humanity. What is called abstract humanitarianism is actually real bourgeois humanitarianism. The Soviet revisionist clique deliberately adds the word "realistic" before humanitarianism, which is all in vain. Changing the name of a thing does not change its essence. Whether it is called "abstract" or "realistic," the name may be different, but the essence is the same, all being bourgeois humanitarianism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, nor is there hatred without reason." The bourgeoisie loves the bourgeoisie, the proletariat loves the proletariat. Because their interests are aligned. The bourgeoisie hates the proletariat, the proletariat hates the bourgeoisie. Because their interests are opposed. The bourgeoisie loves capitalism and hates socialism and communism; the proletariat loves socialism and communism and hates capitalism. This is determined by their class positions.

"We are all human." "People are friends, comrades, and brothers to each other." This is the sale of the bourgeoisie's trash from over a hundred years ago. Marx and Engels gave it a witty ridicule at the time: "Why distinguish between people, animals, plants, and stones? We are all objects!" Now, the Soviet revisionist clique has turned this trash into a "great communist principle," a "great accelerator for pushing Soviet society towards communism." What a "great accelerator"! Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the bourgeoisie always attempts to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, restore capitalism, and regain their lost paradise. Therefore, the proletariat must carry out the proletarian revolution to the end, implement the dictatorship over the bourgeoisie, "repay them in their own coin," and absolutely cannot talk about love and benevolence to the bourgeoisie. If the proletariat falls for humanitarianism, treats the bourgeoisie and their representatives as friends and comrades, and fraternizes with them, it will only "accelerate" the restoration of capitalism and will never "accelerate" the arrival of communism. For more than a decade, the Soviet revisionist clique's chatter about humanitarianism has filled people's ears, resulting in a good socialist society being "accelerated" into a capitalist society, making capitalism fully restored in the Soviet Union. This is a bitter lesson for the international communist movement.

The core of the communist ideological system is the character "public." In a certain sense, communism is the ideology of public service. The "public" we talk about is for the public of the proletariat, for the revolutionary people, for the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, for the cause of socialism and communism. The "selflessness" and "selfless spirit" taught by Chairman Mao are the highest and most scientific summaries of the communist spirit. In contrast, humanitarianism, like all the ideological systems of exploiting classes, has the character "private" at its core. It regards the pursuit of individual liberation, personal dignity, and personal happiness as the highest purpose of life. Humanitarianism is "private" humanitarianism, it is egoism.

The Soviet clique loudly advocates "humanitarianism," not only to cover up their betrayal of communism, but also, as they themselves say, to "transform" the consciousness of the Soviet people "according to the spirit of humanitarianism." In other words, they use the "private" in people's minds to implement the rule of the ruble, material incentives, using selfishness, welfareism, and individualism to corrupt the masses, making the Soviet people not strive for the public good, not do revolution, but only pursue a few rubles of "personal happiness," to achieve their goal of restoring capitalism.

The Soviet revisionist clique says, "Everything for the people, for the people's happiness" is their "motto," their "guiding principle." This is completely a fraud. For whom? For whose happiness? You are for the Soviet revisionist clique, for the happiness of a small group of bourgeois privileged classes. As for the Soviet working people, you have already tormented them enough! But at the end of September this year, the Soviet revisionist clique hypocritically passed a resolution to supposedly increase the people's "welfare." Reading this resolution is truly laughable! On the one hand, you ruthlessly exploit the Soviet working people, and on the other hand, you put on a show of caring about the people's "welfare." With these small favors, can you cover up your crimes of exploitation and buy the hearts of the Soviet people?

The power is in the hands of which class, this determines everything. Without the power of the proletariat, there is no happiness for the proletariat and the working people. Therefore, for the proletariat and the working people, only by establishing the communist ideology of public service and fighting for the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat for life, can they achieve the greatest happiness.

Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. This is the basic guideline for guiding our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a strategic line for transitioning from socialism to communism. Only by fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism can we thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, smash bourgeois ideology, establish Mao Zedong Thought, reform people's worldviews, uproot the roots of revisionism, cultivate a new generation of communists, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, consolidate and develop the socialist system, and transition from socialism to communism victoriously.

Without destruction, there can be no construction. Without thoroughly smashing humanitarianism, we cannot establish communism. In fact, scientific communism is precisely established and developed in the struggle against bourgeois humanitarianism.

The slogan of humanitarianism was put forward by bourgeois thinkers during the 14th to 16th centuries in Europe during the Renaissance. It played an active role in enlightening and liberating from scholastic philosophy and church ideology, and in the struggle against feudal rule. However, this slogan was hypocritical from the beginning. In its subsequent development, it became reactionary hypocrisy, becoming a tool for the bourgeoisie to advocate class reconciliation, oppose class struggle of the proletariat, and oppose the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Since Marx and Engels established scientific communism, until their later years, they never relaxed their criticism of the humanitarian trend. The Soviet revisionist clique does not mention Marx and Engels' criticism of humanitarianism, but from the manuscript of "The German Ideology," they took a segment indirectly quoting bourgeois scholars that Marx deleted, and cut off the beginning and end, finding the words "'realistic humanitarianism' is communism," as the basis for their fallacy that "communism is the embodiment of realistic humanitarianism." From this, it can be seen that the Soviet revisionist clique, in order to peddle their revisionist black goods, uses such despicable methods!

In his later years, Engels wrote in the "Preface to the 1892 German Second Edition of 'The Condition of the Working Class in England'" that his early works and his later views are not completely consistent. He said: "Just as the embryo of a human in its earliest stage of development still shows the gill arches of our fish-like ancestors, in this book one can find everywhere the traces of the origin of modern socialism from one of its ancestors, German classical philosophy." He then angrily said: "There are still such people today who, from an impartial high position, preach to workers a socialism that transcends all class oppositions and class struggles, these people, if they are not still new learners, are the most vicious enemies of the workers, wolves in sheep's clothing." Soviet revisionist clique, you are not "new learners," you are old hands at anti-Marxism-Leninism, you are the most vicious enemies of the workers and "wolves in sheep's clothing"!

Our era is the era of the collapse of imperialism and the victory of socialism worldwide. As Chairman Mao said: "The ideological system and social system of communism are surging forward with the force of a mountain torrent and the power of thunder, maintaining their youthful beauty throughout the world." Under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the proletariat and working people of the world will surely inherit the great tradition of the October Revolution, defeat modern revisionism, defeat bourgeois humanitarianism, defeat all the ideologies of the exploiting classes, and seize the victory of communism worldwide.

    无产阶级的共产主义和资产阶级的人道主义
    鲁红宣
    最近，苏修叛徒集团在大谈其“建设共产主义”的时候，没有再说共产主义是“土豆烧牛肉”，而是说：“共产主义是现实人道主义的化身”。
    “现实人道主义的化身”，比起“土豆烧牛肉”来，似乎文雅一些，不那么馋。但是，“现实人道主义的化身”，并不是无产阶级的科学共产主义。它和“土豆烧牛肉”一样，都是资产阶级的冒牌货，因而都掩盖不了苏修背叛共产主义、背叛十月革命道路的丑恶面目。
    毛主席说：“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。”
    共产主义思想体系就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰，是最彻底、最完备的共产主义思想体系。
    苏修叛徒集团一贯企图把共产主义和人道主义“融合”起来，用人道主义来代替共产主义。他们说：“共产主义思想体系是最人道的思想体系”，“共产主义意识形态是最人道的意识形态”。用“最人道”三个字来恭维共产主义思想体系，这是对共产主义思想体系的最大诬蔑。苏修老爷们，你们应当说“共产主义思想体系是最不人道的思想体系”才对。因为共产主义思想体系“最”不合乎地主资产阶级的“人道”，首先是“最”不合乎你们的“人道”。否则，你们为什么要从根本上加以“修正”呢？
    苏修叛徒集团的“共产主义是现实人道主义的化身”的谬论，把人道主义观念当作第一性的东西，把共产主义制度当作第二性的东西，当作由人道主义观念派生出来的“化身”，这是典型的历史唯心主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有具体的人性，没有抽象的人性。在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”所以，只要剥掉人性论的抽象外衣，就可以看出它的现实性，即资产阶级性。所谓抽象的人性，实际上就是现实的资产阶级的人性。所谓抽象的人道主义，实际上就是现实的资产阶级的人道主义。苏修叛徒集团特意在人道主义之前冠上“现实”二字，完全是枉费心机。改变了事物的名称，并不等于改变了事物的本质。叫“抽象”的也好，叫“现实”的也好，名称虽然不同，本质完全一样，都是资产阶级的人道主义。
    毛主席教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”资产阶级爱资产阶级，无产阶级爱无产阶级。因为它们的利益是一致的。资产阶级恨无产阶级，无产阶级恨资产阶级。因为它们的利益是相反的。资产阶级爱资本主义，恨社会主义、共产主义；无产阶级爱社会主义、共产主义，恨资本主义。这是由它们的阶级地位决定的。
    “我们都是人”。“人对人是朋友、同志和兄弟”。这是贩卖资产阶级一百多年以前的破烂。马克思和恩格斯当时就给了它一个颇有风趣的讽刺：“为什么要分什么人、兽、植物、石头呢？我们都是物体！”现在，苏修叛徒集团竟把这个破烂说成是“伟大的共产主义原则”，是“推动苏联社会走向共产主义的一个最大的加速器”。好一个“最大的加速器”！在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级总是企图推翻无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟，恢复他们已经失去的天堂。因此，无产阶级要由社会主义进到共产主义，就必须把无产阶级革命进行到底，对资产阶级实行专政，“即以其人之道，还治其人之身”，而决不能对资产阶级讲博爱，施仁政。如果无产阶级上了人道主义的当，把资产阶级及其代表人物当作朋友、同志，和他们称兄道弟，那就只会“加速”资本主义复辟，绝不会“加速”共产主义的到来。十几年来，苏修叛徒集团关于人道主义的聒噪，塞满了人们的耳朵，结果把一个好端端的社会主义社会“加速”为资本主义社会，使资本主义在苏联全面复辟。这是国际共产主义运动的一个惨痛的教训。
    共产主义思想体系的核心，是一个“公”字。从一定的意义上说，共产主义就是为公主义。我们说的为公，是为无产阶级的公，为革命人民的公，为无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的公，为社会主义、共产主义事业的公。毛主席教导我们的“毫不利己专门利人的精神”，“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，就是共产主义精神的最高的最科学的概括。与此相反，人道主义和一切剥削阶级的思想体系一样，它的核心是一个“私”字。它把追求个性解放、个人尊严、个人幸福，当作人生的最高目的。人道主义就是“私”道主义，就是利己主义。
    苏修集团大肆鼓吹“人道主义”，不仅是为了掩盖他们对共产主义的背叛，而且是正象他们自己所说的那样，“按照人道主义精神”，对苏联人民的意识“进行改造”。换句话说，他们利用人们头脑里的“私”字，实行卢布挂帅，物质刺激，用名利主义、福利主义、个人主义，腐蚀群众，使苏联人民不去为公，不干革命，只顾追求几个卢布的“个人幸福”，以达到他们复辟资本主义的目的。
    苏修叛徒集团说，“一切为了人，为了人的幸福”是他们的“座右铭”，是他们的“纲领性原则”。这完全是一个骗局。你们究竟为了什么人？为了谁的幸福？你们是为了苏修叛徒集团，是为了一小撮资产阶级特权阶层的幸福。至于苏联劳动人民，被你们折磨得已经够苦的了！可是，在今年九月底，苏修叛徒集团却装模作样地通过了一个所谓增加人民“福利”的决议。看了这个决议，真叫人好笑！你们一方面残酷地压榨苏联劳动人民，另一方面却又摆出一副关心人民“福利”的样子。凭这一点小恩小惠，就能掩盖住你们的剥削罪行，就能收买苏联人民的心吗？
    政权在哪一个阶级手里，这一点决定一切。没有无产阶级的政权，就没有无产阶级和劳动人民的幸福。因此，对无产阶级和劳动人民来说，只有树立起一心为公的共产主义思想，终生为无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政而斗争，才是最大的幸福。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席最近指示我们：要斗私，批修。这是指导我国无产阶级文化大革命的基本纲领，是从社会主义过渡到共产主义的战略方针。只有把斗私、批修搞好了，才能彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，改造人的世界观，挖掉修正主义根子，培养出一代共产主义新人，才能巩固和加强无产阶级专政，巩固和发展社会主义制度，才能从社会主义胜利地过渡到共产主义。
    不破不立。不大破人道主义，就不能大立共产主义。事实上，科学共产主义正是在同资产阶级人道主义的斗争中，建立和发展起来的。
    人道主义这个口号，是在十四世纪到十六世纪欧洲文艺复兴时期，资产阶级的思想家提出来的。它在摆脱经院哲学和教会思想的束缚中，在反对封建统治的斗争中，曾经起过积极的启蒙作用。但是，这个口号从一开始就是虚伪的。在它以后的发展过程中，则变成了反动的伪善，变成了资产阶级宣扬阶级调和，反对无产阶级的阶级斗争，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的思想武器。
    马克思和恩格斯自从创立了科学共产主义之后，直到晚年，一直没有放松过对人道主义思潮的批判。苏修叛徒集团对马克思、恩格斯批判人道主义的言论只字不提，却从《德意志意识形态》的手稿中被马克思删去了的一段间接引述资产阶级学者的话中，掐头去尾，找了“‘现实的人道主义’即共产主义”这几个字，当作他们自己的“共产主义是现实人道主义的化身”的谬论的根据。从这里可以看出，苏修叛徒集团为了贩卖他们的修正主义黑货，采取的手法是何等的卑劣！
    恩格斯在晚年写的《〈英国工人阶级状况〉1892年德文第二版序言》中，曾明确指出，他早期的著作和他后来的观点，并不完全一致。他说：“正如人的胚胎在其发展的最初阶段还要再现出我们的祖先鱼类的鳃弧一样，在本书中到处都可以发现现代社会主义从它的祖先之一即德国古典哲学起源的痕迹。”接着，他忿怒地说：“现在也还有这样一些人，他们从不偏不倚的高高在上的观点向工人鼓吹一种凌驾于一切阶级对立和阶级斗争之上的社会主义，这些人如果不是还需要多多学习的新手，就是工人的最凶恶的敌人，披着羊皮的豺狼。”苏修叛徒集团，你们不是什么“新手”，你们是反马克思列宁主义的老手，是地地道道的“工人的最凶恶的敌人”和“披着羊皮的豺狼”！
    我们的时代，是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代。正如毛主席所说：“共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，全世界的无产阶级和劳动人民，一定能继承伟大的十月革命的传统，战胜现代修正主义，战胜资产阶级人道主义，战胜一切剥削阶级思想，夺取共产主义在全世界的胜利。
