One morning, in the Ninh Binh Province of North Vietnam, in a certain commune of Nho Quan District, the militia company's position to the southeast saw eight American aggressor planes flying in a line towards the river.

The first batch of two enemy planes dove down and dropped six bombs. The second batch of two planes followed suit. By this time, the militia position was already on high alert. The platoon leader, holding a command flag, kept his eyes fixed on the enemy. The militia members held their breath, ready to fire.

The two enemy planes flying at high altitude could not escape the soldiers' line of sight. The platoon leader said to the soldiers, "The enemy is trying to find an opportunity to attack us. We must definitely shoot them down!"

Bombs exploded all around, sending dirt and rocks flying onto the fortifications. The militia soldiers were fearless, keeping a close eye on the enemy.

Suddenly, the platoon leader shouted, "Prepare!" The militia members saw two enemy planes approaching the position from a distance of 1,700 meters and an altitude of over 1,000 meters. The planes flew closer and closer, growing larger.

"Fire!" The platoon leader waved the flag in his hand vigorously.

Angry bullets flew from the militia members' guns. The two American aggressor planes did not even have time to drop their bombs before they turned tail and fled.

"Hit the left wing!" someone shouted.

Sure enough, people saw one plane trailing a black smoke as it fled eastward. There was a loud explosion in the sky, and the plane, engulfed in flames, crashed into the forest in an instant.

The American pilot who bailed out landed about 50 meters away from the wreckage. As soon as he hit the ground, he was surrounded by public security soldiers and militia self-defense team members. At this moment, eight enemy planes appeared in the sky, spraying bullets indiscriminately around the downed pilot, attempting to rescue him. The soldiers bravely retaliated against the enemy planes' provocations while capturing the pilot. Seeing the situation was dire, the pilot raised his hands in surrender and was immediately captured. The aggressor planes in the sky were also driven away by the fierce firepower of the self-defense team, fleeing towards the sea.

    紧紧盯住敌人打！
    一天早上，越南北方宁平省儒关县某乡民兵连阵地的东南面出现了八架美国强盗飞机，它们排成一线向沿河方向飞来。
    第一批两架敌机俯冲投了六枚炸弹。第二批两架也随即俯冲。这时，民兵阵地上早已严阵以待。中队长手里拿着指挥旗目不转睛地盯着敌人。民兵们都屏住气，准备射击。
    在高空飞行的两架敌机始终逃不出战士们的视线。队长向战士们说，“敌人正妄图伺机袭击我们。我们一定要把它们揍下来！”
    炸弹在四周爆炸，泥土石块纷纷落在工事上，民兵战士毫不畏惧，紧紧盯住敌人。
    突然，队长大声喊道：“准备！”民兵们看见在距离一千七百米、高一千多米的地方，有两架敌机向阵地直冲过来，敌机越飞越近，越来越大。
    “打！”队长把手中的旗子大力一挥。
    愤怒的子弹从民兵们的枪口里飞了出去，两架美国强盗飞机还来不及投弹就掉头逃窜。
      “打中左翼了！”
    果然，人们看见一架敌机拖着一条黑烟向东逃去。空中发出了爆炸的巨声，机身冒着火光，顷刻间就坠落在森林里。
    跳伞逃命的美国飞贼，降落在离飞机残骸五十米的地方。他刚落地就立刻被公安战士和民兵自卫队员们包围。这时，天空出现了八架敌机，它们向地面上的飞贼的四周胡乱扫射，准备抢救飞贼。战士们一面勇敢地回击敌机的挑衅，一面围捕飞贼。飞贼见势不妙，慌忙地举起双手，当即就擒。空中的强盗飞机也被自卫队的猛烈火力打得招架不住，向海上逃遁。
