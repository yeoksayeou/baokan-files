The 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly debated the so-called "China representation issue" from November 20 to 28. This debate showed that despite the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, together with reactionaries from various countries, becoming increasingly frenzied in their slander of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, and stirring up wave after wave of anti-China sentiment, the howling of a small clique of anti-China clowns cannot in the slightest damage the international prestige of the great socialist China, nor can it damage the respect and friendly feelings of the people of the whole world towards the Chinese people who are advancing with the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, Albania, Algeria, Cambodia, Congo (Brazzaville), Cuba, Guinea, Mali, Mauritania, Pakistan, Romania, Syria, and eleven other countries jointly submitted a proposal, reaffirming their demand to restore the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations and to expel the so-called "representatives" of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits from the United Nations organizations. Subsequently, the Republic of Sudan also joined the list of countries initiating this proposal.

The proposal pointed out: "The lawful government of China is the sole genuine representative of the outstanding Chinese people," while the Chiang Kai-shek bandits who are holed up in Taiwan "exist only because of the long-term presence of U.S. armed forces there."

The U.S. imperialists once again used their manipulated "majority" to obstruct the passage of this proposal, thereby again exposing their gangster-like face of insisting on being enemies of the great Chinese people and ignoring world public opinion; at the same time, this also once again shows that the so-called "United Nations" is merely a tool serving U.S. imperialist aggression policies.

As in previous years, the U.S. representative, on the one hand, spread anti-China rumors in the meeting, maliciously slandering China; on the other hand, as usual, he gathered a small clique of Japanese, Thai, and Philippine lackeys to play tricks on the procedural voting issue, unreasonably demanding that the issue of restoring China's lawful representation be treated as an "important issue" that requires a two-thirds majority to decide, in order to obstruct the resolution of this issue. The U.S. imperialists, year after year, cling to this proposal, which has long been refuted and discredited, not only showing their arrogance and roguishness but also deeply reflecting the weak essence and desperate plight of this paper tiger.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, which is vigorously pushing the line of aligning with the U.S. against China, also took a shameful betrayal stance on the so-called "China representation issue." On November 21, Soviet representative Fedlin, while hypocritically expressing "support" for the restoration of China's lawful rights, maliciously equated this issue with the issue of "admitting" two Germanys. It is clear that the Soviet revisionist representative did this not only to deliberately confuse the issue but also, in fact, to respond to the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas." At the same time, the Soviet revisionist leaders also directly provided materials for the U.S. imperialists and their running dogs to incite anti-China sentiment in the United Nations. According to reports, before the debate began, the Chiang bandit "mission" to the United Nations had widely distributed anti-China statements by Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev and Soviet revisionist publications. During the debate, the Thai representative also quoted extensively from Soviet revisionist anti-China materials as "evidence" to oppose the restoration of China's lawful representation.

However, no matter how frenzied the U.S., the Soviet revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries are in their anti-China actions, their rumors cannot erase the living reality: under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have achieved and are continuing to achieve brilliant achievements in all aspects of socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has shaken the world, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is spreading more widely and deeply in people's hearts. The international prestige of socialist China has reached an unprecedented height.

During the debate, Albania and many other countries that uphold justice and are friendly to China, such as Pakistan, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Nepal, Ceylon, the United Arab Republic, Syria, Iraq, Algeria, Sudan, Mauritania, Mali, Guinea, Tanzania, Congo (Brazzaville), Zambia, and Romania, spoke out in support of restoring China's lawful rights in the United Nations. In their speeches, they emphasized China's important position in current international affairs, generally praised China's great role in the anti-imperialist, anti-colonial struggle, and strongly refuted the slanders of the imperialists and revisionists against China, exposing the proposal by the United States and a small clique of its followers to treat the so-called "China representation issue" as an "important issue," as well as the proposal by Italy and other countries to establish a "committee" to "study" the "China representation issue" in order to prepare public opinion for the U.S. imperialists' plot to create "two Chinas."

The Albanian representative said: China "has become a major factor in maintaining international peace and security" and "is an impregnable fortress for all revolutionary and progressive forces in the world." The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China "has inspired the freedom-loving peoples of various countries, further enhancing and strengthening their courage and determination to fight against imperialism."

The Cambodian representative pointed out at the beginning of this debate that the so-called "China representation issue" is entirely fabricated by U.S. imperialism and its satellite countries. Only the Government of the People's Republic of China can represent China, while the Chiang Kai-shek bandits are merely a small group of fugitives holed up in Taiwan Province, China, under the protection of the U.S. Marine Corps. The Cambodian representative also emphasized that no independent sovereign state can accept the so-called "two Chinas" solution. The Pakistani representative, in his speech supporting the proposal by Albania and twelve other countries, emphasized that in dealing with major international issues of the day, China's opinions must be heard.

The Malian representative strongly condemned the imperialist policy of obstructing the restoration of China's lawful rights. He praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as a "vibrant, richly contented revolution, the highest manifestation of democracy in history." He also praised China for its "firm anti-imperialist, anti-colonial policy" and refuted the anti-China rumors of the imperialists and revisionists. The Congolese (Brazzaville) representative condemned the U.S. tactics of delaying the restoration of China's lawful rights and demanded an immediate change to the "absurd situation" where the Chiang Kai-shek bandits "represent" China, while the representatives of China's lawful government are excluded from the United Nations. The representatives of Guinea and Tanzania, in their speeches, condemned the U.S. practice of using force to support the Chiang Kai-shek bandits in occupying Chinese territory Taiwan and usurping China's lawful seat in the United Nations. The Zambian representative praised China as a "great, respectable country." He refuted the imperialists' slanders against China. The Mauritanian representative praised China for its firm stance against colonialism, saying: "Great China, one of the great powers of our time, is a peace-loving country."

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our friends are all over the world. We are not afraid of isolation and will never be isolated." Although the U.S. imperialists, with the cooperation of the Soviet revisionists and other accomplices and lackeys, rely on the voting machine they control to once again obstruct the restoration of the lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, the truly increasingly isolated ones are not the great seven hundred million Chinese people, but only the U.S. imperialists themselves!

    美帝苏修借联合国辩论所谓“中国代表权问题”掀起反华逆流
    反华小丑岂能阻挡中国人民阔步前进阿尔巴尼亚等国代表严词驳斥帝修的反华谰言赞扬中国巨大作用
    新华社二十九日讯　本社记者报道：第二十二届联合国大会从十一月二十日到二十八日又一次辩论了所谓“中国代表权问题”。这场辩论表明：尽管美帝苏修伙同各国反动派，越来越疯狂地诋毁伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，掀起一股又一股的反华逆流，但是，一小撮反华小丑的声嘶力竭的狂吠，丝毫损害不了伟大的社会主义中国蒸蒸日上的国际威望，也丝毫损害不了全世界人民对高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗阔步前进的中国人民的崇敬和友好感情。
    在这一届联合国大会上，阿尔巴尼亚、阿尔及利亚、柬埔寨、刚果（布）、古巴、几内亚、马里、毛里塔尼亚、巴基斯坦、罗马尼亚、叙利亚等十一国联合提出了一项提案，重申了它们关于恢复中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法权利、把蒋介石匪帮的所谓“代表”驱逐出联合国机构的要求；随后，苏丹共和国也参加到这项提案的发起国行列。
    提案指出：“中国合法政府是卓越的中国人民的唯一真正代表”，而盘踞台湾的蒋介石匪帮，“只是由于美国武装部队长期驻在那里才得以存在”。
    美帝国主义，又一次利用它操纵的“多数”来阻挠这一提案的通过，从而再次暴露了它坚持同伟大的中国人民为敌、无视世界公正舆论的强盗嘴脸；同时，这也又一次表明，所谓“联合国”，不过是为美帝侵略政策服务的一个工具。
    同往年一样，美国代表在这次辩论中，一方面在会上大肆散布反华谰言，恶毒诽谤中国；另方面，照例纠集日本、泰国、菲律宾等一小撮仆从走卒，在表决程序问题上耍花招，无理地要把恢复中国合法代表权的问题，当作一个需要三分之二的多数才能决定的“重要问题”来处理，以阻挠这个问题的解决。美帝国主义年复一年地死抱住这样一个早已被驳得体无完肤的“提案”不放，这不仅表现了它的蛮横与无赖，同时也深刻反映了这个纸老虎的虚弱本质和黔驴技穷的狼狈相。
    大力推行联美反华路线的苏修领导集团，在所谓“中国代表权问题”上同样采取了可耻的背叛立场。苏联代表费德林二十一日在假惺惺地表示“支持”恢复中国合法权利的同时，别有用心地把这个问题同“接纳”两个德国的问题相提并论。很明显，苏修代表这样作，不仅是故意混淆视听，而且实际上是在同美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋相呼应。与此同时，苏修头目们还直接为美帝及其走狗在联合国煽动反华提供了材料，据报道，在这次辩论开始之前，蒋匪帮驻联合国“使团”，就曾大量印发苏修头目勃列日涅夫以及苏修报刊的反华言论，在辩论过程中，泰国代表也曾大量引用苏修反华材料，作为反对恢复中国合法代表权的“论据”。
    但是，不管美帝、苏修和各国反动派如何猖狂反华，它们的谰言毕竟无法抹杀活生生的现实：在伟大领袖毛主席英明领导下的中国人民，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的各方面都已经取得、并正在继续取得辉煌成就，特别是，史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命震撼了全世界，战无不胜的毛泽东思想正在空前广泛地传播和日益深入人心，社会主义中国的国际威望空前提高。
    在辩论过程中，阿尔巴尼亚以及其他许多主持正义、对中国友好的国家，如巴基斯坦、柬埔寨、阿富汗、尼泊尔、锡兰、阿联、叙利亚、伊拉克、阿尔及利亚、苏丹、毛里塔尼亚、马里、几内亚、坦桑尼亚、刚果（布）、赞比亚、罗马尼亚等国的代表纷纷发言支持恢复中国在联合国的合法权利。他们在发言中强调指出了中国在当前国际事务中的重要地位，普遍赞扬中国在反帝、反殖斗争中的巨大作用，并且严词驳斥了帝修反对中国的诽谤，揭露了美国及其一小撮追随者抛出的要把所谓“中国代表权问题”作为“重要问题”来处理的提案，以及意大利等国为了给美帝制造“两个中国”的阴谋准备舆论而再次提出的所谓成立一个“委员会”来“研究”“中国代表权问题”的提案。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表说：中国“已成为维护国际和平与安全的一个重大因素”，“是世界上一切革命的和进步的力量的不可攻克的堡垒”，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，“鼓舞了爱好自由的各国人民，进一步提高和加强了他们进行反帝斗争的勇气和决心”。
    柬埔寨代表在这次辩论一开始的时候就指出：关于所谓“中国代表权问题”的争论，完全是美帝国主义和它的卫星国制造出来的。只有中华人民共和国政府才能代表中国发言，而蒋介石匪帮不过是在美国海军陆战队庇护下盘踞在中国台湾省的一小撮逃亡分子。柬埔寨代表还强调指出，没有一个独立的主权国家能够接受所谓“两个中国”的解决办法。巴基斯坦代表在发言支持阿尔巴尼亚等十二国提案时强调指出，在处理当代重大国际问题时，必须听取中国的意见。
    马里代表强烈谴责阻挠恢复中国合法权利的帝国主义政策。他盛赞中国的无产阶级文化大革命是一场“生气勃勃的、内容丰富的革命，是历史上独一无二的民主的最高体现”。他还赞扬中国奉行“坚决反帝反殖政策”，并且驳斥了帝修反的反华谰言。刚果（布）代表谴责美国拖延恢复中国合法权利的手法，要求立即改变让蒋介石匪帮“代表”中国，而把中国合法政府的代表排除在联合国之外的这种“荒谬局面”。几内亚的代表和坦桑尼亚代表在发言中都谴责美国用武力支持蒋介石匪帮盘踞中国领土台湾和窃据中国在联合国的合法席位的作法。赞比亚代表赞扬中国是一个“伟大的、可尊敬的国家”。他驳斥了帝国主义对中国的诬蔑。毛里塔尼亚代表赞扬中国坚持反对殖民主义的立场，他说：“伟大的中国，我们当代的大国之一，是一个爱好和平的国家。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“我们的朋友遍天下。我们不怕孤立，也绝不会孤立。”美帝国主义虽然在苏修及其它帮凶、仆从的配合下，凭借它所操纵的表决机器，得以再一次阻挠恢复中华人民共和国在联合国的合法权利，但是真正越来越孤立的决不是伟大的七亿中国人民，而只能是美帝国主义自己！
