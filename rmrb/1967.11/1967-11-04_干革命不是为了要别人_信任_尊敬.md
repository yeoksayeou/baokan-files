Title: Revolution is Not for Gaining "Trust" and "Respect"

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "A Communist Party member should be open and aboveboard, loyal, and active, placing the interests of the revolution as the first priority, and subordinating personal interests to the interests of the revolution."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev shamelessly advocates: "A person, especially a Party member, who devotes himself to the revolution, struggles to the end, even sacrificing his life, is the most worthy, the most admirable, and the most memorable and praiseworthy by future generations." He further says: "Although in certain personal enjoyments, they may suffer some losses temporarily, they are, or will eventually be, trusted and respected by us all and by the masses."

We must ask: Is the revolution for gaining others' "admiration," "trust," and "respect"? When heroes like Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Liu Yingjun, and many other unnamed heroes sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, did they ever think about whether their actions would gain others' "admiration," "trust," and "respect"?

True proletarian revolutionaries are armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, devoid of any selfish motives. They always dedicate themselves to the revolution and the people, with unwavering loyalty to the Party and the proletarian cause. In their minds and words, you will never find phrases like "suffering losses," "gaining advantages," "worthy," or "unworthy," which are typical of the bourgeoisie.

On the contrary, someone who constantly thinks about personal "losses," "advantages," "worthy," or "unworthy" can never be loyal to the Party and the proletarian revolutionary cause. All they have is a selfish heart and wild ambitions. Such people, even before they do anything, have already calculated their personal gains and losses. They always try to minimize their "losses" and maximize their "advantages." They boast about their minor achievements, exaggerating them greatly, and even turn their mistakes into merits. Such people only pretend to "suffer a little loss," but in reality, they want to "gain big advantages." Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview." The Chinese Khrushchev and his ilk are representatives of the bourgeoisie who want to change the world according to the bourgeois worldview. The Chinese Khrushchev's endless talk about seeking others' "admiration," "trust," and "respect" is actually about pursuing "reputation" and "status." In essence, they want to turn Party members, who are the vanguard of the proletariat, into bourgeois individualists chasing fame and reputation; they want to turn the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China into a revisionist party. Such Party members can only be good members of a bourgeois political party; such a party can only be a good party of the bourgeoisie, completely incompatible with the proletariat.

Recently, Chairman Mao issued a call: to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism. We firmly respond. We must thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of the bourgeois ideology spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, and resolutely fight against the "self" in our minds. We must thoroughly criticize and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev in terms of politics, ideology, and theory!

    干革命不是为了要别人“信任”“尊敬”
    上海量具刃具厂　曹正申
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却大肆宣扬：“一个人，特别一个党员”为革命而牺牲奋斗到底，以至终身，甚至牺牲自己的生命，“是最值得，最引起人们的敬仰，最为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”。又说：“虽然在某些个人享受上，他们暂时吃一点亏，然而他们是，或者最后是，为我们大家及群众所信任，所尊敬的”。
    我们不禁要问：干革命是为了要别人“敬仰”“信任”“尊敬”吗？雷锋、王杰、刘英俊……还有许多无名的英雄，当他们为人民利益不惜牺牲自己的生命的时候，难道他们想过这样做能否引起人们的“敬仰”“信任”“尊敬”吗？
    真正的无产阶级革命者是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的，毫无自私自利之心。他们总是一心为革命，一心为人民，对党和无产阶级事业赤胆忠心。在他们的头脑中，在他们的语言中，是找不到“吃亏”“便宜”“值得”“不值得”这些资产阶级习惯用语的。
    反过来，一个人时刻考虑个人的“吃亏”“便宜”“值得”“不值得”，他对党对无产阶级革命事业，说什么也不会赤胆忠心，有的只能是一颗“私心”，一颗“野心”。这种人，事情还没有做，个人主义的算盘早就打好了。他总是千方百计打算“亏”吃得越小越好，“便宜”占得越大越好。他做了一点事情，就夸夸其谈，小小成绩会吹得大大的，甚至会把错误吹成功劳。这种人“吃一点亏”是假，要“占大便宜”是真。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界。”中国赫鲁晓夫之流，就是要用资产阶级世界观去改造世界的资产阶级代表人物。中国赫鲁晓夫喋喋不休地要人们去追求别人的“敬仰”“信任”“尊敬”，就是要人们去追求“名誉”“地位”。说穿了，就是要把无产阶级先锋战士的党员，变为追名逐誉的资产阶级个人主义者；要把伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党变为修正主义的党。这样的党员，只能是资产阶级政党的“好党员”；这样的党，只能是资产阶级的“好的党”，同我们无产阶级是格格不入的。
    最近，毛主席发出号召：要斗私，批修。我们坚决响应。我们要彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫散布的资产阶级思想的流毒，狠斗头脑中的私字；我们要从政治、思想、理论上彻底批臭、批倒中国赫鲁晓夫！
