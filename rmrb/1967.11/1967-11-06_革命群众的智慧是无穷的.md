The great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution have illuminated the path for resuming classes and making revolution, providing us with the sharpest weapon.

To carry out the educational revolution, we must follow the mass line thoroughly, mobilize the masses fully, and rely on them resolutely, especially on the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat. Otherwise, we will achieve nothing. We have learned this lesson. In July of this year, our school once attempted to resume classes and make revolution, but because we did not conduct deep and thorough political and ideological work, and did not fully mobilize the masses, we could not sustain the effort.

Recently, we have seriously studied Chairman Mao's directives on educational revolution, and our understanding has deepened. The proletarian educational revolution is a mass movement. Only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them, by drawing on the masses' wisdom from all sides, and by giving full play to their initiative, can we carry the educational revolution through to the end. At the same time, we have seen that among some cadres, teachers, students, and workers, there are many ideological problems that hinder the progress of resuming classes and making revolution. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Grasping ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." To solve these problems, we must start with political and ideological education.

As we began to resume classes and make revolution, we concentrated our efforts on organizing study classes. The entire school set up three types of study classes: classes for cadres, classes for core members, and classes for ordinary members, organizing all the masses of the school to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's latest directives. With the struggle against selfishness and revisionism as the guiding principle, we addressed the different problems among cadres and the masses, setting different requirements. Through study, cadres gained a more correct understanding of their own problems and of the revolutionary youngsters, putting down their burdens and marching forward lightly. The revolutionary cadres overcame petty-bourgeois factionalism within their ranks and were able to unite as one to throw themselves into the educational revolution. Through study, breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, the broad masses were mobilized, and their activists expressed their determination to achieve new victories in resuming classes and making revolution.

Now, the entire school has seen a great situation in the educational revolution. Through practice, we have come to understand Chairman Mao's directives more deeply. The wisdom of the revolutionary masses is boundless. We will certainly further mobilize the masses' initiative and carry the educational revolution through to the end.

    革命群众的智慧是无穷的
    国际关系学院革命委员会
    伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，照亮了复课闹革命的道路，给了我们最锐利的武器。
  要搞好教育革命，必须走彻底的群众路线，充分发动群众，坚决依靠群众，特别是依靠无产阶级革命派。不然的话，将是一事无成。在这方面，我们是有过教训的。今年七月份，我们学校曾经搞过一次复课闹革命，因为没有做深入细致的政治思想工作，没有把群众充分地发动起来，所以没有坚持下来。
    不久前，我们认真学习了毛主席关于教育革命的指示，认识又进一步提高了。无产阶级教育革命，是群众性的革命运动，只有动员群众，依靠群众，多方面集中群众的智慧，发挥群众的积极性，才能把教育革命进行到底。同时，我们又看到，在一些干部、教师、学生和工人中，都有不少思想问题，妨碍着复课闹革命的开展。毛主席教导我们说：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”要解决这些问题，必须从政治思想教育入手。
    复课闹革命开始，我们就集中力量抓学习班，全院办了三种学习班：干部班、骨干班和普通班，把全院群众都组织起来，学习“老三篇”和毛主席的最新指示。以斗私批修为纲，针对干部、群众中的不同问题，提出不同的要求。通过学习，干部对自己的问题和对革命小将，都有了比较正确的认识，放下了包袱，轻装上阵。革命派内部进一步克服了小资产阶级派性，能团结一致地投入教育革命。通过学习，破私立公，广大的群众发动起来了，他们中间的积极分子表示要在复课闹革命中立新功。
    现在，全院已出现了教育革命的大好形势。通过实践，使我们对毛主席的指示理解得更深刻。革命群众的智慧是无穷的，我们一定把群众的积极性进一步调动起来，把教育革命进行到底。
