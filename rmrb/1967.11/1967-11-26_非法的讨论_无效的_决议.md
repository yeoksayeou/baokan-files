At this session of the United Nations General Assembly, American imperialism once again manipulated its lackeys to illegally "pass" a so-called "resolution" on the "Korean question." This "resolution" clamors that the United Nations' purpose in Korea is to "establish" a Korea under "representative leadership," claiming that the so-called "United Nations Korean Reconstruction and Unification Committee" should "redouble its efforts" to achieve these goals, and insisting that the "United Nations forces" should continue to "remain" in South Korea. This is another shameful record in the history of the United Nations.

The United Nations is a tool of American imperialism's aggression against Korea. It directly participated in the U.S. aggression against Korea, committing heinous crimes against the Korean people. Under the banner of the United Nations, a large number of American aggressor troops are still stationed in South Korea, continuing to enslave and oppress the Korean people. The United Nations has no right to discuss the "Korean question." The issue of Korean reunification can only be resolved by the Korean people themselves, and the United Nations has no right to interfere. American imperialism's use of the United Nations to discuss the so-called "Korean question" is completely illegal, and the "resolution" it passed is utterly invalid.

The so-called "United Nations Korean Reconstruction and Unification Committee" is an illegal organization created by the United States. For more than a decade since its establishment, it has done nothing good, neither promoting Korea's "unification" nor aiding Korea's "reconstruction," but instead providing cover for American imperialism's occupation of South Korea. American imperialism uses this organization to obstruct Korean reunification and maintain its colonial rule in South Korea. To achieve Korean reunification, the first step is to drive the American aggressor troops out of South Korea and disband the "Reconstruction and Unification Committee." Now, the United Nations' illegal resolution not only supports the continued presence of American aggressor troops in South Korea but also calls for the "Reconstruction and Unification Committee" to "redouble its efforts" to establish a Korea under "representative leadership." This is clearly an attempt to legalize American imperialism's long-term occupation of South Korea and even to extend its colonial rule to North Korea. This is sheer audacity.

The illegal resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly is entirely to serve the needs of American imperialism's policy of aggression in Asia. American imperialism has always regarded South Korea as a bridgehead for its aggression in Asia. Currently, it particularly needs to consolidate this base of aggression to send more South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam and expand the war of aggression in Vietnam. Therefore, the United Nations, under American manipulation, passing an illegal resolution is not only a provocation against the Korean people but also a provocation against the peoples of all Asian countries.

In this farce directed by the United States, the Soviet revisionist leadership plays a particularly shameful role. The Soviet revisionist clique claims to support the Korean people, yet it agrees to the United Nations discussing the "Korean question" and acknowledges the United Nations' right to interfere in Korea's internal affairs. The Soviet revisionist representative's speech does not dare to touch on the essence of the United Nations being a tool of American imperialism's aggression against Korea. This is clearly an attempt to bring the "Korean question" into the track of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, using the interests of the Korean people as a bargaining chip in their political dealings with the United States. This is a most shameful betrayal of the Korean people.

The will of the Korean people to achieve national reunification is irresistible. They will never allow American imperialism to occupy South Korea for long. As our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out, "Every place the American imperialists invade, they put a noose around their own necks. The longer the American aggressors stay in these places, the tighter the noose around their necks will be." No "resolution" of the United Nations can save American imperialism from its inevitable doom.

The Chinese people have always firmly supported the Korean people's struggle against American imperialism, against the American puppet regime of Park Chung-hee, and for Korean reunification. We are confident that the Korean people's wish to reunify their country will surely be realized, and the American aggressors will inevitably be driven out of Korean soil.

    非法的讨论　无效的“决议”
    本报评论员
    在本届联合国大会上，美帝国主义又操纵它的娄罗，非法地
  “通过”所谓“朝鲜问题”的“决议”。这个“决议”叫嚷，联合国在朝鲜的“目的”是“建立”一个“代议制领导下”的朝鲜，说什么要所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”“加紧努力以实现这些目的”，并且坚持“联合国部队”要继续“留在”南朝鲜。这是联合国在自己历史上写下的又一个可耻纪录。
    联合国是美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的工具。它直接参与美国侵略朝鲜的战争，对朝鲜人民犯下了滔天罪行。打着联合国旗号的大量美国侵略军队至今还赖在南朝鲜，继续奴役和蹂躏朝鲜人民。联合国根本没有资格讨论“朝鲜问题”。朝鲜的统一问题，只能由朝鲜人民自己解决，联合国更无权过问。美帝国主义挟持联合国讨论所谓“朝鲜问题”完全是非法的，它通过的“决议”也是根本无效的。
    所谓“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”，是美国一手炮制的一个非法机构。它成立十多年来，一点好事没干，既不是促进朝鲜的“统一”，更谈不上有助于朝鲜的“复兴”，而是专给美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜打掩护。美帝国主义正是利用这个组织来阻挠朝鲜的统一，维持它在南朝鲜的殖民统治。要实现朝鲜的统一，首先就是要美国侵略军滚出南朝鲜，解散“统一复兴委员会”。现在联合国通过的非法决议，不仅支持美国侵略军继续赖在南朝鲜，而且叫嚷要“统一复兴委员会”“加紧努力”，以实现建立一个“代议制领导下”的朝鲜。这分明是要使美帝国主义长期霸占南朝鲜“合法化”，并且还妄图把美帝国主义在朝鲜的殖民统治扩展到朝鲜北部。真是狂妄到了极点。
    联合国大会通过的非法决议，完全是为了适应美帝国主义在亚洲推行侵略政策的需要。美帝国主义一直把南朝鲜作为它侵略亚洲的一个桥头堡。目前它尤其需要巩固这个侵略阵地，以便把更多的南朝鲜傀儡军派往南越，扩大侵越战争。因此，联合国在美国操纵下通过非法的决议，不仅是对朝鲜人民的挑衅，也是对亚洲各国人民的挑衅。
    在美国导演的这出丑剧中，苏修领导集团扮演着十分可耻的角色。苏修集团口口声声说是支持朝鲜人民，然而却同意联合国讨论“朝鲜问题”，承认联合国有干涉朝鲜内政的权利。苏修集团的代表在发言中根本不敢触及联合国是美帝国主义侵略朝鲜的工具这个实质问题。这显然是想通过联合国把“朝鲜问题”纳入美苏合作的轨道，拿朝鲜人民的利益来作为他们同美国进行政治交易的筹码。这是对朝鲜人民最无耻的背叛。
    朝鲜人民要求实现祖国统一的意志，是不可抗拒的。他们绝不答应美帝国主义长期霸占南朝鲜。正如我们伟大领袖毛主席指出的，美帝国主义每侵略一个地方，就把一条绞索套在自己的脖子上，“美国侵略者在这些地方停留得越久，套在它的头上的绞索就将越紧。”联合国的任何“决议”，都挽救不了美帝国主义必然失败的命运。
    中国人民一贯坚决支持朝鲜人民反对美帝国主义、反对美国走狗朴正熙傀儡集团和实现朝鲜统一的斗争。我们坚信，朝鲜人民统一祖国的愿望一定会实现，美国侵略者必将从朝鲜的土地上滚出去。
