Only those who represent the masses can educate the masses; only those who are students of the masses can be teachers of the masses. If one regards oneself as the master of the masses and as a nobleman standing above the "common people," then no matter how great one's abilities, one is not needed by the masses, and one's work has no future.

    毛主席语录
    只有代表群众才能教育群众，只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生。如果把自己看作群众的主人，看作高踞于“下等人”头上的贵族，那末，不管他们有多大的才能，也是群众所不需要的，他们的工作是没有前途的。
    《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》
