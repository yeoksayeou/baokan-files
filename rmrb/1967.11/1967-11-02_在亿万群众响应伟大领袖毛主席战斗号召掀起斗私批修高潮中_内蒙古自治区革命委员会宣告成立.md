In the midst of billions of people responding to the great leader Chairman Mao's battle call to launch a high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee is established.

On November 2, 170,000 people of various ethnic groups in Hohhot held a grand celebration, sending a message of respect to Chairman Mao and reading the first announcement.

The establishment of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee marks the complete collapse of the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Inner Mongolia, and the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist and separatist clique's evil plots. This is a heavy blow to the American imperialists, Soviet and Mongolian modern revisionists, and all reactionaries. The people of all ethnic groups are determined to take fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism as the key link, push the revolutionary criticism to new heights, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units, so that the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought will forever fly high over the Inner Mongolian grasslands.

Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, November 1: In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and amidst the nationwide billions of revolutionary masses resolutely responding to the great leader Chairman Mao's battle call to launch a new high tide of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was officially established today.

The victory of the Inner Mongolian proletarian revolutionaries in their struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and the realization of the great alliance and the three-in-one combination of the Inner Mongolian proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary people of various ethnic groups, is a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, a great joy for the people of all ethnic groups in China, and another heavy blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as a heavy blow to American imperialism and Soviet and Mongolian modern revisionism and all reactionaries.

Today, the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, is adorned with red flags. People of various ethnic groups are joyful. When the sun rises, tens of thousands of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses from all fronts in the city, carrying the giant portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and holding the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," gathered from all directions to the central square of the city to solemnly celebrate the birth of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. People repeatedly sang, "The party's kindness is greater than the heavens and the earth, the affection of parents is not as great as Chairman Mao's affection." "The most resounding song is 'The East is Red,' and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong."

The celebration began with the majestic music of "The East is Red." The first announcement of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee solemnly declared: From now on, all power in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, including party, government, finance, and culture, is entirely in the hands of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee. At this moment, the entire venue erupted in thunderous applause and enthusiastic cheers: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!"

The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee is headed by Comrade Teng Haiching as the chairman, with Comrades Wu Tao, Gao Jinming, and Huo Daoyu as vice chairmen.

The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee marks the complete collapse of the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev in Inner Mongolia and the complete failure of the counter-revolutionary revisionist and separatist clique's evil plots to restore capitalism and split the unity of the motherland in Inner Mongolia.

A handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and separatists in the Inner Mongolia region are a group of feudal princes, nobles, landlords, and representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party. They have always waved the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, fiercely opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Under the pretext of "emphasizing national issues," they opposed emphasizing proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely sabotaging the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the people of all ethnic groups. They vigorously advocated class cooperation and the theory of the extinction of class struggle, opposing Chairman Mao's great teachings on class and class struggle, opposing the socialist revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. They maliciously distorted Chairman Mao's policy of regional ethnic autonomy, using the so-called "nationalization of organs" and "nationalization of cadres" as a cover to place and promote national reactionaries and counter-revolutionaries, attempting to change the nature of the proletarian dictatorship in regional autonomy. In the pastoral areas, they insisted on implementing the "peaceful transition" policy of "no struggle, no division, no class distinction" and "mutual benefit for herdsmen and herdsmen owners," using every means to protect the exploiting classes and develop capitalism. They spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, advocating national separatism, and creating public opinion for their evil plots to restore capitalism and split the unity of the motherland.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the broad proletarian revolutionaries of the Mongolian, Han, and other ethnic groups, with boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao, displayed great revolutionary spirit and launched a general offensive against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in the Inner Mongolia region. They fought side by side, defending Chairman Mao, defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and defending the color of the motherland's borders.

At the critical moment of the struggle, the great leader Chairman Mao personally issued the "Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Handling of the Inner Mongolia Issue," dispersing the dark clouds over the Inner Mongolian grasslands and illuminating the course of the Inner Mongolian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionaries achieved decisive victory in the struggle to seize power.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." The Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Inner Mongolia stood up at the critical moment, firmly supporting the broad revolutionary masses of the left, and made outstanding contributions and built immortal merits in the "three supports, two militaries" work and the struggle to defend the motherland's borders.

At present, the revolutionary and production situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is unprecedentedly good, with a vibrant atmosphere everywhere. The broad proletarian revolutionaries and the people of all ethnic groups have been fully mobilized. Mao Zedong Thought has never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as it is today, Chairman Mao's revolutionary line has never been as well-known as it is today, the people of all ethnic groups have never been as united as they are now, and the dictatorship of the proletariat has never been as consolidated as it is now. Under Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production," and under the impetus of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Inner Mongolia has achieved a bumper harvest in animal husbandry this year, a good harvest in agriculture, and a thriving industrial production.

At the celebration, Comrade Teng Haiching, the chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, spoke. In his speech, he summarized the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in the Inner Mongolia region. He said that the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee marks the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia. But this does not mean the end of the revolution, "This is only the first step of the long march of ten thousand li," and the work ahead is more arduous and great.

He said that the victory of the Inner Mongolian proletarian revolutionaries in the struggle to seize power relies on Mao Zedong Thought, and in the future, to hold power well and use power well, it still relies on Mao Zedong Thought. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, the most fundamental and important task is to hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to arm the masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary young people, revolutionary intellectuals, and revolutionary cadres with Mao Zedong Thought, and to further promote the revolutionization of people's thinking. This is the most reliable and fundamental guarantee to prevent revisionism and prevent the restoration of capitalism.

Teng Haiching said that Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central South, and East China are the most scientific, complete, profound, and thorough summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and a half, a beacon guiding the entire Party, the country, and the army to forge ahead, and the newest and most powerful ideological weapon to ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must resolutely carry them out, sentence by sentence, word by word. We must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, carry out the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units, further consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the three-in-one combination in terms of ideology. The proletarian revolutionaries must be models of fighting selfishness and heroes of criticizing revisionism.

He said that we must carry out the revolutionary criticism movement more extensively and deeply, concentrate firepower and targets, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical levels, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Inner Mongolia. We must thoroughly clean up the influence and poison left by the counter-revolutionary revisionist and separatist clique in various fields and fronts over the past twenty years, and push the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide. We must take Mao Zedong Thought as the guideline and carry out profound reforms in various fields to turn the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

He said that the proletarian revolutionaries must firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army. We must learn from the People's Liberation Army, support the People's Liberation Army, maintain the high prestige of the People's Liberation Army, actively assist the People's Liberation Army in the "three supports, two militaries" work, and cherish the People's Liberation Army as we cherish our eyes. The People's Liberation Army must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions to "support the broad masses of the left," hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries, and build new merits and labor in the "three supports, two militaries" work. We must carry out the "support the army, love the people" movement more deeply, extensively, persistently, and enthusiastically.

Teng Haiching pointed out that Inner Mongolia is a minority autonomous region, and correctly handling national issues is of great significance. Chairman Mao's theory on national issues and a whole set of Marxist-Leninist national policies are reliable guarantees for correctly observing and solving national issues, strengthening national unity, and consolidating the unity of the motherland. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, we must seriously study and vigorously publicize Chairman Mao's theory on national issues, correctly implement Chairman Mao's national policies, thoroughly settle accounts with a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists on national issues against Mao Zedong Thought, and eliminate their poison. We proletarian revolutionaries, regardless of which nationality, have the same ideological foundation of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and the same road of socialism and communism. We should unite closely on this common foundation and under the same goal, and forever march forward under the guidance of Chairman Mao.

Teng Haiching finally said that our Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is located in the northern border of the motherland. We proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must strengthen our awareness of the enemy, enhance our revolutionary vigilance, timely expose the tricks of the class enemy, resolutely suppress the special agents of the American Chiang Kai-shek, Soviet and Mongolian revisionists, and Japanese special agents, smash the sabotage activities of the class enemy, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Comrade Teng Haiching also, as the deputy commander of the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, conveyed greetings from the broad officers and soldiers of the Beijing Military Region to the conference.

Representatives of revolutionary workers and peasants from Hohhot City, representatives of the Red Guard Revolutionary Rebel Command of Hohhot City's colleges and universities, and representatives of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Inner Mongolia spoke at the celebration. They represented the revolutionary masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, and students of all ethnic groups in the region and jointly wished our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao a long life! Long life!

They said in their speeches: We Inner Mongolian proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary masses of all ethnic groups must, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao, hold power well and use power well! We must, under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We must more resolutely implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, and firmly grasp the direction of the revolutionary struggle. We must, in accordance with Chairman Mao's latest instructions on "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," transform the objective world while transforming the subjective world, establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, consolidate and develop the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and build our proletarian revolutionary forces to be stronger and better. We must take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, push the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide, and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units. We must play the role of the main force in "grasping revolution and promoting production" and in the struggle to resume classes and make revolution, and support the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee with actual actions.

They expressed that in the current good situation, we must be modest and prudent, advance while consolidating our gains, and with high revolutionary vigilance, prevent the sabotage of the class enemy, consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly forever over the Inner Mongolian grasslands.

The celebration received congratulatory messages from various places across the country.

The conference, amidst thunderous applause and endless cheers, passed a message of respect to our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao.

After the celebration, the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the revolutionary masses together held a grand parade.

    呼和浩特十七万各族群众举行盛大庆祝会，通过给毛主席的致敬电并宣读第一号通告
    自治区革命委员会成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古的代理人彻底垮台，宣告了反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团的罪恶阴谋彻底破产，是对美帝苏修蒙修和一切反动派的沉重打击。各族人民决心以斗私批修为纲，把革命大批判推向新高潮，巩固和发展革命的大联合和三结合，搞好本单位的斗批改，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗千秋万代高高飘扬在内蒙古草原。
    新华社呼和浩特一日电　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，在全国亿万革命群众坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的战斗号召掀起斗私批修的新高潮中，内蒙古自治区革命委员会今天正式成立了。
    内蒙古无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的胜利，内蒙古无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民革命大联合、革命三结合的胜利实现，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，是我国各族人民的大喜事，是对以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的又一个沉重打击，是对美帝国主义和苏、蒙现代修正主义以及一切反动派的沉重打击。
    今天，内蒙古自治区首府呼和浩特市到处红旗招展，各族人民喜气洋洋。当旭日东升的时候，全城各条战线的无产阶级革命派和革命群众十七万人，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅画像，手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，从四面八方汇集到市中心广场，隆重庆祝内蒙古自治区革命委员会的诞生。人们一遍遍地高唱：“天大地大不如党的恩情大，爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。”“最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。”
    庆祝大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。大会宣读的内蒙古自治区革命委员会第一号通告庄严宣布：自即日起，内蒙古自治区的党、政、财、文一切权力，统统归于内蒙古自治区革命委员会。这时，全场掌声雷动，热烈欢呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会由滕海清同志任主任委员，吴涛、高锦明、霍道余同志任副主任委员。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会的成立，宣告了中国赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古的代理人的彻底垮台，宣告了反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团妄图在内蒙古复辟资本主义、分裂祖国统一的罪恶阴谋的彻底破产。
    内蒙古地区的一小撮反革命修正主义分子、民族分裂主义分子，是一批混进党内的封建王公贵族、牧主、地主、资产阶级的代表人物。他们一贯打着“红旗”反红旗，疯狂地反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想。他们借口所谓“突出民族问题”，来反对突出无产阶级政治，反对突出毛泽东思想，疯狂破坏各族人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。他们竭力鼓吹阶级合作和阶级斗争熄灭论，反对毛主席的阶级和阶级斗争的伟大学说，反对社会主义革命和无产阶级专政。他们恶意歪曲毛主席的民族区域自治政策，以推行所谓“机关民族化”和“干部民族化”为名，安插和重用民族反动派和反革命分子，妄图改变区域自治的无产阶级专政的性质。他们在牧区坚持推行“不斗、不分，不划阶级”、“牧工牧主两利”的“和平过渡”政策，千方百计保护剥削阶级，发展资本主义。他们大肆散布封建主义、资本主义和修正主义毒素，宣扬民族分裂主义，为他们复辟资本主义、分裂祖国统一的罪恶阴谋大造舆论。　
    在毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，蒙、汉等民族的广大无产阶级革命派怀着对毛主席的无限忠心，发扬大无畏的革命精神，向中国赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古地区的代理人发动了总攻击。他们风雨同舟，并肩战斗，保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫祖国边疆不变颜色。
    在斗争的紧要关头，伟大领袖毛主席亲自批发了《中共中央关于处理内蒙问题的决定》，驱散了内蒙古草原上的乌云，照亮了内蒙古文化大革命的航程，无产阶级革命派取得了夺权斗争的决定性胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”中国人民解放军驻内蒙古部队，在关键时刻挺身而出，坚决支持左派广大革命群众，在“三支”“两军”工作和保卫祖国边疆的斗争中，作出了卓越的贡献，建立了不朽的功勋。
    当前，内蒙古自治区的革命和生产的形势空前大好，到处一派热气腾腾。广大无产阶级革命派和各族人民群众充分发动起来了。毛泽东思想从来没有象今天这样深入人心，毛主席的革命路线从来没有象今天这样家喻户晓，各族人民从来没有象现在这样团结，无产阶级专政从来没有象现在这样巩固。在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，在无产阶级文化大革命高潮的推动下，内蒙古今年牧业生产大丰收，农业生产获得了良好收成，工业生产蒸蒸日上。
    在庆祝大会上，内蒙古自治区革命委员会主任委员滕海清同志讲了话。他在讲话中总结了内蒙古地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。他说，内蒙古自治区革命委员会的成立，标志着内蒙古的无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。但这并不意味着革命的结束，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”，今后的工作更艰巨、更伟大。
    他说，内蒙古无产阶级革命派夺权斗争的胜利，靠的是毛泽东思想，今后要掌好权、用好权，靠的还是毛泽东思想。内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立以后，最根本最重要的头等大事就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装工农兵群众、红卫兵革命小将、革命知识分子和广大革命干部，进一步促进人的思想革命化。这是防止修正主义，防止资本主义复辟的最可靠最根本的保证。
    滕海清说，毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的一系列极为重要的指示，是毛主席对一年多来无产阶级文化大革命最科学、最完整、最精辟、最透彻的总结，是指引全党、全国、全军奋勇前进的灯塔，是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的最新、最强大的思想武器。我们必须坚决照办，句句照办，字字照办。我们必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，搞好革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改，进一步从思想上巩固和发展革命的大联合，巩固和发展革命的三结合。无产阶级革命派，要成为斗私的模范，批修的闯将。
    他说，我们一定要更广泛、更深入地开展革命大批判运动，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，彻底批倒、批臭。一定要把反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义集团二十年来在各个领域、各条战线上的影响和流毒，来一次彻底的大扫除，把革命的大批判推向一个新高潮。我们要以毛泽东思想为指针，在各个领域中进行深刻的改革，把内蒙古自治区办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    他说，我们无产阶级革命派一定要坚定不移地“相信和依靠人民解放军”。要学习人民解放军，拥护人民解放军，维护人民解放军的崇高威望，积极协助人民解放军做好“三支”“两军”工作，象爱护眼睛一样地爱护人民解放军这座伟大的长城。人民解放军要坚决执行毛主席的关于“支持左派广大群众”的教导，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，在“三支”“两军”工作中，为人民立新功，建新劳。我们要更深入、更广泛、更持久、更热烈地开展“拥军爱民”运动。
    滕海清指出，内蒙古是一个少数民族自治区，正确处理民族问题，具有重大的意义。毛主席关于民族问题的理论和一整套马克思列宁主义的民族政策，是正确观察和解决民族问题，增强民族团结，巩固祖国统一的可靠保证。内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立以后，一定要认真学习和大力宣传毛主席关于民族问题的理论，正确贯彻执行毛主席的民族政策，彻底清算一小撮反革命修正主义分子在民族问题上反毛泽东思想的罪行，肃清他们的流毒。我们无产阶级革命派，不管是那个民族，共同的思想基础就是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，共同的道路就是社会主义、共产主义。我们应当在这个共同的基础上，在统一的目标下，紧密地团结起来，永远沿着毛主席指引的航向奋勇前进。
    滕海清最后说，我们内蒙古自治区地处祖国北部边疆，我们无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众必须加强敌情观念，提高革命警惕性，及时地揭穿阶级敌人的一切阴谋诡计，坚决镇压美蒋特务、苏修蒙修特务、日本特务，粉碎阶级敌人的一切破坏活动，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
    滕海清同志还以中国人民解放军北京部队副司令员的身份，代表北京部队广大指战员向大会致了贺词。
    呼和浩特市革命工人、革命农民代表，呼和浩特市大、中（专）院校红卫兵革命造反司令部（呼三司）代表，中国人民解放军驻内蒙古部队代表在庆祝大会上先后发言。他们代表全区工、农、兵、学各族革命群众，共同祝愿我们各族人民心中最红最红的红太阳，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    他们在讲话中说：我们内蒙古无产阶级革命派和各族革命群众，一定要在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，在毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央领导下，掌好权，用好权！我们要在内蒙古自治区革命委员会的领导下，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我们一定要更加坚决地贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，牢牢掌握革命斗争的大方向。我们一定要遵照毛主席“斗私，批修”的最新指示，在改造客观世界的同时，改造主观世界，大办毛泽东思想学习班，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把我们无产阶级革命派的队伍建设得越来越好，越来越强。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，把革命的大批判推向新的高潮，把本单位的斗批改搞好。我们要在“抓革命，促生产”和复课闹革命方面发挥主力军的作用，以实际行动给自治区革命委员会有力的支持。
    他们表示：在当前大好形势下，我们要谦虚谨慎，乘胜前进，要以高度的革命警惕性，严防阶级敌人的破坏，巩固和加强无产阶级专政，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗千秋万代高高飘扬在内蒙古草原。
    庆祝大会收到了全国各地的贺电、贺信。
    大会在极其热烈的掌声和经久不息的欢呼声中通过了给我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的致敬电。
    大会结束以后，革命委员会的全体成员和革命群众一起，举行了盛大的庆祝游行。
