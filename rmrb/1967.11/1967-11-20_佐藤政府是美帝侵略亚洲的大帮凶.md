The Sato government is a major accomplice of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Asia. Sato's visit to the U.S. intensifies his pursuit of U.S. imperialism, hostility towards China, and active support for U.S. aggression in Vietnam. He is willing to sell out national interests to allow U.S. imperialism to long occupy Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands.

	BEIJING, Nov. 17 (Xinhua) -- Our correspondent reports: The loyal running dog of U.S. imperialism, Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, arrived in Washington on November 14 to begin a nine-day "official visit" to the United States. By November 15, he had already held a series of talks with U.S. imperialist leaders Johnson, Rusk, and McNamara. Sato's visit to the United States indicates that the Japanese reactionaries are further intensifying their pursuit of U.S. imperialism, hostility towards and opposition to China, and more actively serving U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary strategy in Asia.

	To prepare for this visit to the United States, Sato, in September and October of this year, conducted two rounds of counter-revolutionary collusion in Asia and the Pacific region, almost visiting all of U.S. imperialism's accomplices and lackeys in this region. U.S. news agencies believe that Sato's talks with U.S. imperialist leaders are one of the most important activities in the history of U.S.-Japan collusion.

	The materials that have been released and leaked so far indicate that anti-China sentiment is a common theme running through Sato's visit to the United States and is the main topic of his talks with Johnson and others. In the face of the unprecedentedly high international prestige of the great fortress of world revolution, China, and the flourishing revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia and the world, U.S. imperialism, which is in unprecedented difficulties, is frantically inciting anti-China sentiment. The Japanese reactionaries, who have long harbored dreams of dominating Asia, are also increasingly hostile towards China. The Johnson-Sato joint communiqué issued on November 15 again, under the tattered pretext of the so-called "Chinese threat," reaffirmed their collusion in anti-China activities. The communiqué claimed that their talks "especially focused" on "developments in the Far East" and that they had reached a consensus on the "importance" of creating conditions for "Asian countries not to be threatened by Communist China."

	The communiqué and the talks between Sato and Johnson and others all mentioned the so-called "East Asian security" or "peace and security in the Far East." In reality, they are discussing tightening their collusion and vigorously promoting their counter-revolutionary strategy of aggression against Asia. U.S. imperialism, mired in the quagmire of the Vietnam War and unable to extricate itself, desperately needs the Japanese reactionaries to act as its watchdogs and enforcers in Asia and the Pacific region. Therefore, Johnson and McNamara repeatedly emphasized the "active role" and "shared responsibility" of the Japanese reactionaries in helping the United States suppress the burgeoning revolutionary movements of the peoples of Asia. The Japanese reactionaries, on the other hand, are full of ambition and eager to try. Sato repeatedly stated that Japan would "more closely" cooperate with U.S. imperialism and "make active contributions to the peace and stability of Asia according to its own capabilities." He also assured Johnson that Japan would "firmly maintain" the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" that keeps Japan firmly hitched to the U.S. war chariot of aggression against Asia. Master and servant, one calling, one responding, fully exposing their evil intentions of colluding and opposing the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of various countries in Asia.

	The Vietnam issue is another important topic in the Johnson-Sato talks. In September and October, Sato, in the guise of the "manager" of the Johnson administration, ran between the U.S. imperialist lackeys and servants in Vietnam, driving them to work even more actively for the U.S. war in Vietnam. Now, he, as the "leader" of this group of lackeys and servants, is receiving new instructions from the master in Washington. Playing a double role, running up and down, fully exposing Sato's ugly face.

	In the face of the Johnson administration's repeated defeats in the Vietnam War, Sato, this loyal slave of U.S. imperialism, dared to defy the world by shamelessly praising his master's so-called "great efforts" in Vietnam, brazenly praising U.S. imperialism's "consistent adoption of active and constructive attitudes" in seeking the so-called "peaceful resolution of the Vietnam issue," and expressing active support for the U.S. imperialist's trick of "bombing for peace" and "bombing to force negotiations."

	The results of the Johnson-Sato talks indicate that the Japanese ruling clique's prior claim that Sato was going to the United States "to resolve the issue of returning Okinawa" is a complete fraud. The Japanese reactionaries released this smoke screen to cover up their evil plot of tightening their counter-revolutionary collusion with U.S. imperialism.

	Japanese Prime Minister Sato, completely ignoring the strong calls of the Japanese people for the immediate, unconditional, and complete return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, is willing to sell out the national interests of the Japanese people and openly sing in tune with Johnson, emphasizing that the U.S. military bases on these islands play an "extremely important role" in "guaranteeing the security of Japan and other free countries in the Far East," so that U.S. imperialism can long occupy Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands and carry out aggressive activities.

	Sato's visit to the United States has sparked strong protests and demonstrations from the Japanese people. His series of counter-revolutionary activities in the United States, which go against the interests of the Japanese people and are hostile to the Chinese and Asian peoples, will surely further intensify the struggle of the Japanese people against U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries.

### 佐藤政府是美帝侵略亚洲的大帮凶

    佐藤政府是美帝侵略亚洲的大帮凶
    佐藤访美加紧追随美帝敌视中国，积极为美帝侵越效劳
    不惜出卖民族利益使美帝长期强占冲绳和小笠原群岛
    新华社十七日讯　本社记者报道：美帝国主义的忠实走狗、日本首相佐藤荣作，十一月十四日到达华盛顿，开始对美国进行为期九天的“正式访问”。到十五日，他已经同美帝头目约翰逊、腊斯克和麦克纳马拉进行了一系列会谈。佐藤这次美国之行表明，日本反动派正在进一步加紧追随美帝，敌视和反对中国，更积极地为美帝侵略亚洲的反革命战略效劳。
    为了给这次访美作准备，佐藤在今年九月和十月，曾经两次在亚洲和太平洋地区进行反革命串连，几乎遍访了美帝在这一地区的所有帮凶和走卒。美国通讯社认为，佐藤这次同美帝头目的会谈，是日美勾结史上最重要的活动之一。
    目前已经公布和透露的材料表明，反华是贯穿在佐藤这次美国之行中的一条黑线，是他同约翰逊等人会谈的主题。在世界革命的强大堡垒中国的国际威望空前提高、亚洲和全世界人民革命斗争蓬勃发展的形势下，陷于空前困境的美帝国主义正在拚命加紧煽动反华，而一直作着重霸亚洲迷梦的日本反动派也更加敌视中国。十五日发表的约翰逊—佐藤会谈公报就又一次在所谓“中国威胁”这个破烂不堪的幌子下，重申了他们勾结反华的罪恶意图。公报声称，他们两人的会谈“特别着重”于“远东的事态发展”，并且对于所谓“为亚洲国家不受共产党中国威胁创造条件”的“重要性”，“取得了一致意见”。
    会谈公报以及佐藤和约翰逊等人的谈话，都提到所谓“东亚安全”或“远东的和平与安全”问题。实际上，他们谈的是加紧勾结，大力推行侵略亚洲的反革命战略。美帝国主义由于在侵越战争中泥足深陷，无力自拔，极需日本反动派在亚洲及太平洋地区为它充当看家护院的打手。因此，约翰逊和麦克纳马拉等，一再强调日本反动派在帮助美国镇压蓬勃发展的亚洲人民革命运动方面的“积极作用”和“共同责任”；而日本反动派，对此也是野心勃勃，跃跃欲试。佐藤一再表示，日本将“更加紧密”地配合美帝，“根据自己的能力对亚洲的和平、稳定作出积极的贡献”。他还向约翰逊保证，日本将“坚决保持”把日本牢牢拴在美国侵略亚洲战车上的日美“安全条约”。主子奴才一呼一应，把他们狼狈为奸、反对中国人民和亚洲各国革命人民的罪恶企图暴露无遗。
    越南问题是约翰逊—佐藤会谈中的又一个重要题目。九、十月间，佐藤曾以约翰逊政府“总管”的面目奔走于美帝侵越帮凶、仆从之间，驱使它们更积极地为美国侵越战争卖命；如今，他又以这伙帮凶、仆从的“头目”的身份，向华盛顿的主子领取新的指示。一身二任，上窜下跳，充分暴露了佐藤的丑恶嘴脸。
    在约翰逊政府的侵越战争连连惨败的情况下，佐藤这个美帝的忠实奴才，竟然冒天下之大不韪，拚命替他的主子捧场、帮腔。他在华盛顿期间一再发表谈话，奴颜婢膝地对美帝侵越的所谓“巨大努力”表示“深刻的敬意”，无耻地吹捧美帝在谋求所谓“和平解决越南问题”方面“一贯采取了积极的建设性的态度”，并且表示积极支持美帝玩弄“以炸迫和”和“停炸诱和”的骗局。
    佐藤和约翰逊会谈结果表明，日本统治集团事先扬言佐藤是“为了解决归还冲绳问题去美国的”，完全是一场骗局。日本反动派放出这个烟幕是为了掩盖它加紧同美帝进行反革命勾结的罪恶阴谋。
    日本卖国首相佐藤完全无视日本人民要求立即无条件全面地把冲绳和小笠原群岛归还给日本的强烈呼声，不惜出卖日本民族利益，公然同约翰逊唱着一个调子，强调在这些岛屿上的美军基地“在对保证日本和远东其它自由国家的安全方面”有着“极为重要的作用”，以使美帝国主义可以长期强占冲绳和小笠原群岛，进行侵略活动。
    佐藤这次美国之行，曾经引起日本人民的强烈的示威和抗议。他在美国进行的一系列违背日本人民利益、敌视中国和亚洲各国人民的反革命活动，必将促使日本人民反对美帝和日本反动派的斗争进一步高涨起来。
