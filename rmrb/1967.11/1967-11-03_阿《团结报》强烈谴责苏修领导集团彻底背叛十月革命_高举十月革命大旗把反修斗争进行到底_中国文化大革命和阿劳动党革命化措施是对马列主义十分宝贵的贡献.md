The Albanian "Unity" newspaper recently published an editorial titled "The Thoughts of the October Revolution Are a Great Banner for the Peoples of All Countries in Their Struggle Against Imperialism and Modern Revisionism" to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. The editorial strongly condemns the treacherous crimes of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leadership in completely betraying the October Socialist Revolution, the world proletariat, and the international communist movement.

After elaborating on the historical significance of the great October Socialist Revolution, the article states that the Soviet revisionist clique currently in power in the Soviet Party and state has completely betrayed the thoughts of the October Socialist Revolution and has thrown the immortal teachings of the October Socialist Revolution to the winds. After seizing power through deceit and trickery, the Soviet revisionist clique is systematically destroying the magnificent victories achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin through immense efforts and sacrifices. These despicable traitors first attack the great thoughts of the October Revolution. They have been and continue to be bent on emasculating the revolutionary content of these thoughts, distorting historical facts, and ultimately perverting the Marxist-Leninist theories and experiences on the party, revolution, and proletarian dictatorship.

The article goes on to say that these traitors, through their destructive activities, have, in a short period of time, transformed the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from a Bolshevik party prepared to make any sacrifice for the cause of revolution and socialism into a party of opportunist traitors. These traitorous elements, for their narrow self-interest, have abandoned all struggles against imperialism and reactionaries and are ready to kneel and surrender to imperialism and reactionaries at any time. Due to the traitors' destructive activities, the first proletarian dictatorship in the world, the Soviet Union, is now being turned into a tool for the Khrushchevites to more quickly drag the Soviet Union into the capitalist quagmire; the birthplace of socialism and the main pillar of the revolutionary struggle of the peoples of all countries against imperialism, colonialism, and exploitation, has today become the chief culprit of all reactionary forces in the world, the main ally and partner of the arch-enemy of the people, American imperialism, and is fully assisting American imperialism in opposing countries that firmly stand on the socialist position and the liberation struggles of the peoples of all countries as well as the revolutionary movements of the working class and the broad laboring masses. The Soviet Khrushchev revisionist leaders, while continuing to stubbornly walk down the path of betrayal, are doing their utmost to sabotage other communist parties, making them degenerate and collapse, to destroy proletarian dictatorship in other socialist countries, to demolish the socialist camp, and to shatter the world communist movement.

The article states that the treacherous activities of the Soviet Khrushchev revisionists and their accomplices in other countries have brought about enormous losses to the socialist and world revolutionary forces. However, contrary to the expectations of the revisionists and their imperialist masters, the true Marxist-Leninists and all revolutionary forces in the world have resolutely resisted the attacks of the disguised counter-revolutionaries and have repelled them. Now, they are launching a counterattack to thoroughly smash them.

The article points out that it is a source of pride that, under the brave and wise leadership of Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Party of Labour of Albania, together with the Communist Party of China led by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Comrade Mao Zedong, and other Marxist-Leninist parties, have always stood at the forefront of these forces, fearlessly and resolutely waging a sharp struggle against the Khrushchev revisionists, reliably taking up and raising high the banner of the great thoughts of the October Socialist Revolution.

The article says that, on the other hand, the revolutionary forces are becoming increasingly stronger and more consolidated. The negative lessons from the Soviet Union have helped Marxist-Leninist parties take measures to prevent the emergence of revisionism within their ranks. The proletarian cultural revolution in China and the revolutionary measures taken by the Party of Labour of Albania not only prevent the emergence of revisionism in Albania and China but are also precious contributions to the treasury of Marxism-Leninism and valuable positive experiences for all Marxist-Leninist parties. Based on these experiences and the glorious thoughts of the October Revolution, in light of the tragedy that has occurred in the Soviet Union, dozens of new Marxist-Leninist parties and organizations, including those in countries where revisionists are in power, have been established around the world. They are rallying all revolutionary forces around them to fight for the victory of revolution and socialism.

The article says that, despite the Soviet revisionists' attempts to disguise themselves as the heirs of the October Revolution and hysterically continuing their vile slander campaign against the Communist Party of China, the Party of Labour of Albania, and all true Marxist-Leninists, they are closely embracing the enemies of socialism, the frenzied enemies of the October Revolution, the instigators of the dirty war in Vietnam, the American imperialists who are trying to extinguish the revolutionary forces with fire, slaughter, and white terror. The Soviet revisionists are actively promoting capitalism at home and peddling the most reactionary capitalist trash. True Marxist-Leninists cannot help but ask: What does the great October Socialist Revolution have to do with decadent fashions, with obscene music concerts and films? Was it for these things that the Bolsheviks and workers fought in October 1917? The propaganda of the Soviet revisionists further exposes the true face of the Khrushchev revisionists. No matter how they disguise themselves, they have nothing in common with the forebears of the October Socialist Revolution. The international communist movement and the workers' movement have seen through these filthiest traitors and renegades.

The article concludes by saying that for revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists, the most beautiful and magnificent day of the October Socialist Revolution is to further strengthen their unity and solidarity in the struggle against imperialism and its running dogs, the modern revisionists. In this way, they will always remain true to the thoughts of the great October Revolution, completing the tasks of revolution, socialism, and communism. This is also the task facing the Soviet people today.

    阿《团结报》强烈谴责苏修领导集团彻底背叛十月革命
    高举十月革命大旗把反修斗争进行到底
    中国文化大革命和阿劳动党革命化措施是对马列主义十分宝贵的贡献
    新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》最近为纪念十月社会主义革命五十周年，发表题为《十月革命的思想是各国人民在反对帝国主义和现代修正主义斗争中的伟大旗帜》的编辑部文章，强烈谴责苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团彻底背叛十月社会主义革命、全世界无产阶级和国际共产主义运动的卑鄙罪行。
    文章在阐述了伟大十月社会主义革命的历史意义之后说，目前占据苏联党和国家领导地位的苏联修正主义集团，彻头彻尾地背叛了十月社会主义革命的思想，把十月社会主义革命的不朽学说抛到了脑后。苏修集团用狡诈和欺骗的手段窃取了政权之后，正在把苏联人民在列宁和斯大林领导下付出了巨大的努力和牺牲才取得的一切宏伟胜利，一个一个地糟踏殆尽。这些卑鄙无耻的叛徒，首先攻击十月革命的伟大思想。他们过去和现在都千方百计地阉割这些思想的革命内容，颠倒历史事实，以便最终歪曲马列主义关于政党、革命和无产阶级专政的理论和经验。
    文章接着说，这些叛徒以他们的破坏活动，在一个短短的时间内，把苏联共产党从一个为革命和社会主义事业准备作出任何牺牲的布尔什维克党，变成了一个机会主义叛徒分子的党。这些叛徒分子为了他们狭隘的私利，已经放弃了反对帝国主义和反动派的各种斗争，并准备随时向帝国主义和反动派屈膝投降。由于叛徒们的破坏活动，世界上第一个无产阶级专政的苏维埃国家，正在变成赫鲁晓夫分子更快地把苏联引到资本主义泥坑的工具；社会主义的发源地和各国人民进行反对帝国主义、殖民主义和剥削的革命斗争的主要支柱，今天变成了世界一切反动势力的罪魁祸首美帝国主义的主要同盟者和伙伴，并全面帮助美帝国主义反对坚强地站在社会主义立场上的国家，反对各国人民的解放斗争以及工人阶级和广大劳动群众的革命运动。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导人，一边在其背叛道路上继续顽固地走下去，一边竭力破坏其它的共产党，使它们蜕化变质，消灭其它社会主义国家里的无产阶级专政，摧毁社会主义阵营和粉碎世界共产主义运动。
    文章说，苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义者及其同伙在其它国家里的背叛活动，给社会主义和世界革命力量带来了十分巨大的损失。但是，与修正主义及其帝国主义指挥者的预期相反，真正的马克思列宁主义者和全世界一切革命力量，坚决抵抗了伪装起来的反革命分子的进攻，并击退了他们，现在正在发动反攻，以便彻底摧垮他们。
    文章指出，我们感到骄傲的是，在恩维尔·霍查同志勇敢和英明领导下的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，同以杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，以及其它马列主义政党一起，永远站在这些力量的前面，无所畏惧，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义者进行着针锋相对的尖锐斗争，可靠地接过了伟大十月社会主义革命思想的旗帜，并且越举越高。
    文章说，另一方面，革命力量正在日益加强和巩固。苏联出现的反面教训，帮助了马列主义政党采取措施来防止在他们的队伍里产生修正主义。中国的无产阶级文化大革命，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党所采取的革命化措施，不仅防止在阿尔巴尼亚和中国产生修正主义，而且是对马克思列宁主义宝库十分宝贵的贡献，是对所有马列主义政党有价值的正面经验。根据这些经验和十月革命的光荣思想，鉴于苏联出现的悲剧，包括修正主义者当权国家在内的数十个新的马列主义政党和组织，已经在世界各地建立起来，并把一切革命力量聚集在自己的周围，为革命和社会主义的胜利而斗争。
    文章说，尽管苏联修正主义者千方百计地把自己打扮成十月革命的继承者，歇斯底里地继续掀起反对中国共产党、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和一切真正的马克思列宁主义者的卑鄙诽谤运动，他们却同社会主义的敌人，十月革命的疯狂敌人，侵越肮脏战争的元凶，以战火、屠杀和白色恐怖来扑灭革命力量的美帝国主义者打得火热，亲吻拥抱。苏联修正主义者在国内倒行逆施，积极推行资本主义，贩卖反动透顶的资本主义破烂货。真正的马克思列宁主义者不禁要问：伟大的十月社会主义革命同腐化堕落的时髦、同色情淫秽的音乐会和电影有何相干？难道布尔什维克和工人们在一九一七年十月就为这些东西而斗争吗？苏联修正主义者的宣传进一步戳穿了赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的真面目。不管他们怎样打扮自己，他们同十月社会主义革命的前辈毫无共同之处。国际共产主义运动和工人运动认清了这些最肮脏的叛徒和变节者。
    文章最后说，对革命者和马克思列宁主义者说来，十月社会主义革命最美丽和最宏伟的节日，就是要更加加强他们在反对帝国主义及其帮凶现代修正主义者斗争中的团结和一致。这样，他们将始终如一地忠于伟大的十月革命的思想，完成革命、社会主义和共产主义的任务。这也是苏联人民今天所面临的任务。
