The two articles published here are the reflections of comrades from two revolutionary mass organizations in the Sixth Machinery Industry Department after attending a Mao Zedong Thought study class.

To fight selfishness and criticize revisionism—this is the great battle call issued by our great leader Chairman Mao to the proletarian revolutionary masses. Every revolutionary comrade must resolutely respond and carry it out without any compromise, ensuring it is implemented in action.

To fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, one must correctly treat oneself, dare to boldly expose and fight against selfishness, and truly spark a revolution from the depths of one's soul. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have any personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, any errors that we cannot abandon?" For the sake of the revolution and the people's interests, we should have the spirit of exposing selfishness without fear of embarrassment and fighting it without fear of pain. We should unhesitatingly abandon all selfish thoughts and let the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought deeply take root in our minds, guiding us to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Breaking Selfishness and Establishing Public Spirit, Transforming Worldviews
Qin Xiangling, Staff Member, Political Committee of the Sixth Machinery Industry Department United Front Command

Originally, the mass organizations in the Sixth Machinery Industry Department were divided into two major factions. Now it seems that the two factions' major directions of struggle are basically consistent, but due to differing views on certain issues and the mischief of petty-bourgeois factionalism, there has been a serious atmosphere of opposition between the two sides. Chairman Mao's call for revolutionary great unity broke this stalemate. In late September, we achieved revolutionary great unity from the bottom up, based on administrative departments. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To consolidate and develop revolutionary great unity, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, our department held a Mao Zedong Thought study class. I participated in the first session. Initially, I thought that since I had been working day and night during the Cultural Revolution, I was very tired, and there was no selfishness in my mind. Therefore, my attitude was: study the documents well, prepare thoroughly, and debate with others. I had no intention of fighting against the selfishness in my own mind.

Through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Old Five Articles" and his latest instructions during his inspections of various places, and repeatedly comparing and checking myself, I realized that my original thoughts were wrong. I was not without selfishness; instead, I had a lot of it. For example, individualism, factionalism, etc.

The process from not acknowledging selfishness to acknowledging it is a struggle; from acknowledging selfishness to daring to expose it is also a struggle. At that time, although I felt there was selfishness to fight, I did not dare to expose it. The main reasons were twofold: first, I feared the other side would seize on it, and second, I feared my fellow comrades in the faction would have objections. In short, I feared not pleasing both sides, making it hard to get along. Therefore, during the study, I let others speak first, actually to see the "market," and then decide how much and what to say.

Great Mao Zedong Thought broke through my selfishness. "Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" is Chairman Mao's great strategic thought. To truly fight selfishness is to follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment with actual actions; not to fight selfishness when there is selfishness is to not follow Chairman Mao's teachings. At the same time, my fellow comrades in this faction repeatedly urged me to strictly demand of myself and strive to be a pioneer in fighting selfishness. This also touched my thoughts. I thought, now everyone is studying Chairman Mao's works, fighting selfishness, and raising their consciousness. If I have selfishness and do not expose it, isn't that not following Chairman Mao's instructions? Therefore, I followed Chairman Mao's teachings and, regarding my shortcomings and errors, "practiced open, mass self-criticism (criticizing only oneself, not the other side), and thoroughly corrected them." I boldly exposed the various selfish thoughts of individualism and factionalism that existed in me before and after the great unity.

Through "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," I realized that it is very difficult to revolutionize oneself. To fight selfishness, one must first see the selfishness, which is the first step of self-awareness; the second step is to expose the selfishness, not fearing embarrassment; the third step is to use Mao Zedong Thought to criticize and thoroughly fight against the selfishness, not fearing pain. From seeing the selfishness to exposing it, and then to fighting it away, these three processes are the processes of repeated struggles between two kinds of thoughts and two kinds of worldviews. With factionalism, one cannot see the selfishness, always thinking oneself correct and without selfishness to fight; without party spirit, one cannot expose the selfishness, not daring to confront it head-on; without being armed with Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot fight away the selfishness.

On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and under the principle of revolution, uniting first is beneficial for clarifying right and wrong and unifying understanding. However, I did not think this way before. I originally thought that the opposition between the two major factions in our department reflected the struggle between two lines. Therefore, after Chairman Mao's call for revolutionary great unity was issued, I thought of using a great debate to defeat the other side and then unite with my faction as the main body.

My thoughts were tainted with petty-bourgeois factionalism. Chairman Mao said: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable major factions." Chairman Mao also said: "As long as both factions are revolutionary mass organizations, they should achieve revolutionary great unity under the principle of revolution." Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for us, and Chairman Mao's instructions are the basis for unity. Only on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, by each side making more self-criticisms, can we gradually approach each other in thought. The facts have proven that after achieving great unity, the thoughts of the two factions gradually approached each other, the disagreements were fewer than before, and the problems were easier to solve. For example, one of the main principle disagreements between the two factions was the differing views on a certain person in power in our department. After uniting, through discussions, the broad revolutionary masses had a clearer understanding of the issue of this person in power.

On the issue of who should be the core in the great unity, I originally thought that we should be the core. Therefore, I was very particular about the number of seats and positions in the Revolutionary Committee, insisting that our faction should have an absolute majority, and the power should be in our hands. At that time, there were two plans being discussed in the department: one was the thirteen-person plan; the other was the sixteen-person plan. I considered the thirteen-person plan to be in our favor, with our faction having the majority in most departments, so we could use the majority to squeeze out the minority. I carried these thoughts and conducted coordination, but during the consultation, both sides had arguments. At this time, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army did in-depth and detailed ideological work on both sides, requiring the proletarian revolutionary masses to have a high style and high posture in the issue of great unity, to understand the big picture and consider the overall situation. I brought this issue back to study Chairman Mao's relevant works again. I realized that we should struggle for power for the revolution and for the proletariat. As long as someone raises the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, no matter which faction they originally belonged to, we should support them. If they do not raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and do not adhere to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, even if they become the number one, they will eventually fall. The core of the revolution cannot be self-proclaimed; it can only be formed through revolutionary struggles and in the process of revolutionary struggles. Therefore, I felt that the previous proposal of "with me as the core" was wrong.

The facts have proven that only by achieving revolutionary great unity can the revolution be advanced. Because, first, uniting means adhering to the big direction and following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, which is the biggest step forward; second, uniting means carrying out great criticism, unifying understanding of cadres, and creating conditions for the next step of the "three-in-one combination" and struggle-criticism-transformation; third, uniting means promoting mutual understanding, eliminating misunderstandings, and strengthening unity. In short, the process of great unity is the process of fighting selfishness. Without fighting selfishness, one cannot understand the big picture and consider the overall situation, cannot overcome petty-bourgeois factionalism, and cannot achieve great unity.

Through revolutionary great unity, I deeply realized that Chairman Mao's call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism has extremely important strategic significance. Vice Chairman Lin said: "We should regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we should constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution." I will definitely remember the teachings of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin, and while transforming the objective world, constantly transform my subjective world, work for the revolution all my life, fight selfishness all my life, read Chairman Mao's books all my life, and transform my thoughts all my life. I am determined to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

专栏：

    这里发表的两篇文章，是六机部两个革命群众组织的同志参加毛泽东思想学习班的心得体会。
    要斗私，批修，这是伟大领袖毛主席向我们无产阶级革命派发出的伟大战斗号召。每个革命同志都应该坚决响应，坚决照办，不折不扣地落实到行动中去。
    要斗私，批修，就要正确对待自己，敢于大胆亮私和斗私，真正从灵魂深处爆发革命。毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”为了革命的利益，为了人民的利益，我们应该有亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼的精神，毫不犹疑地抛弃一切私心杂念，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想在我们头脑里深深地扎根，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导我们夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。

    破私立公，改造世界观
    六机部大联委政治口联合兵团勤务员　秦祥铃
    六机部机关的群众组织原来分为两大派。现在看来，两大派的斗争大方向基本上是一致的，但由于对某些问题的看法有分歧和小资产阶级派性作怪，双方一直存在着较严重的对立情绪。毛主席发出的实现革命大联合伟大号召，打破了对立的局面。我们在九月下旬实现了自下而上的按行政部门的革命大联合。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利。
    为了巩固和发展革命的大联合，在解放军的帮助下，我部举办了毛泽东思想学习班。我参加了第一期学习。开始总认为自己在文化大革命中白天黑夜搞工作，很辛苦，头脑里没有私。因此，我的态度是：好好学习些文件，作好准备，同别人辩论，根本没有打算斗自己头脑里的私。
    通过学习毛主席的光辉著作“老五篇”，以及毛主席视察各地时的最新指示，反复对照检查自己，才觉得自己原来的想法不对头，自己不是没有私，而是有很多私。例如个人主义、小团体主义，等等。
    由不承认私到承认私，是个斗争过程；由承认私到敢于亮出来，也是个斗争过程。当时，虽然觉得有私可斗，但不敢亮出来。主要有两怕：一怕对方抓辫子，二怕本派的同志有意见。一句话，怕两面不讨好，里外不好做人。因此，在学习时，我先让大家讲，实际上是看看“行市”，再决定自己怎么讲，讲多少。
    伟大的毛泽东思想破除了我这个私。“斗私，批修”是毛主席提出的伟大战略思想，真斗私，就是要以实际行动来紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署；有私不斗，就是不遵循毛主席的教导。同时，原来我们这一派的同志，也一再督促我严格要求自己，争取做斗私的先锋。这对我的思想也有触动。我想，现在每个人都在学习毛主席著作，都在斗私，都在提高觉悟，自己有私不亮，不是不按照毛主席的指示办事了吗？于是，我遵照毛主席的教导，对于自己的缺点错误，“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之。”大胆地把自己在大联合前后存在的个人主义、小团体主义等形形色色的私心杂念，亮了出来。
    通过“斗私，批修”，我体会到，革自己的命是很不容易的。要斗私，就得要先看到私，这是自我认识的第一步；第二步是要亮出私，不要怕丑；第三步是用毛泽东思想对照批判，彻底斗掉私，不能怕痛。从看到私，到亮出私，再到斗掉私，这三个过程，是两种思想、两种世界观反复斗争的过程。带着派性就看不到私，总认为自己正确，无私可斗；没有党性就亮不出私，不敢刺刀见红；不用毛泽东思想武装，就斗不掉私。
    在毛泽东思想的基础上，在革命的原则下，先联合起来，是有利于弄清是非，统一认识的。可是，在以前我却不是这样想的。我原来认为，我部机关两大派的对立，反映了两条路线的斗争。因此，毛主席关于实现革命大联合的号召发出后，我就想通过大辩论，把对方辩倒，然后以我这一派为主体联合起来。
    我的这些想法，是带有小资产阶级的派性的。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”毛主席又说：“只要两派都是革命的群众组织，就要在革命的原则下实现革命的大联合。”毛主席给我们指明了方向，毛主席的指示就是联合的基础。只有在毛泽东思想的基础上，各自多作自我批评，才会在思想上越来越接近。事实证明，实现大联合以后，两派的思想逐步接近了，分歧比过去少了，问题也容易解决了。例如，两派原来的主要原则分歧之一，是对我部的一个当权派的看法有分歧。联合起来后，经过交谈，广大革命群众对这个当权派的问题认识更清楚了。
    在大联合中以谁为核心的问题上，原来我认为，要以我们这一派为核心。因此，对大联委的名额、席位很计较，一定要使我们这派占绝对优势，权要掌握在我们手里。当时机关里议论两个方案：一是十三人方案；二是十六人方案。我考虑十三人方案对我们有利，多数部门我们这一派占优势，这样可以用多数挤少数，把对方挤掉。我带着这些想法进行了串连，但是，在协商时双方发生了争论。这时，解放军同志对双方作了深入细致的思想工作，要求无产阶级革命派在大联合问题上，都应该是高风格、高姿态，识大体，顾大局。我带着这个问题又学习了毛主席有关著作。我认识到，我们应当为革命争权，为无产阶级争权。只要谁高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不管他原来是那一派的，我们都应该拥护。如果他不高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，不坚持毛主席的革命路线，即便当上第一把手，迟早也会垮台的。革命的核心是不能自封的，只有经过革命斗争的考验，在革命斗争过程中形成。所以我感到，以前提“以我为核心”是错误的。
    事实证明，只有实现革命大联合，才能把革命推向前进。因为，第一，联合起来了，坚持了大方向，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，这是前进了最大的一步；第二，联合起来了，开展了大批判，对干部统一了认识，为下一步“三结合”及斗批改创造了条件；第三，联合起来了，促进了彼此的了解，消除了误会，增强了团结。总之，大联合的过程，就是斗私的过程，不斗私，就不能识大体，顾大局，就不能克服小资产阶级派性，就不能实行大联合。
    通过革命大联合，我深刻体会到，毛主席提出要斗私，批修的伟大号召，是有极其重要的战略意义的。林副主席说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”我一定牢记毛主席和林副主席的教导，在改造客观世界的同时，不断改造自己的主观世界，干一辈子革命，斗一辈子私，读一辈子毛主席的书，改造一辈子思想。我决心以“斗私，批修”为纲，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
