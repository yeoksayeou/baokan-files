New Delhi, Nov. 14 (Xinhua) — The "Committee for Aid to the Naxalbari Peasants' Struggle," an organization of the Indian Communist Revolutionary Faction, held a mass rally in Calcutta on Nov. 11 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The meeting highly praised Chairman Mao for hoisting the great banner of the October Revolution and leading the people of the world in revolution. It strongly condemned the Soviet revisionist leading clique for betraying Marxism-Leninism and pursuing a revisionist policy.

Portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, Lenin, and Stalin were hung on the platform. The crowd attending the meeting repeatedly shouted, "Red salute to Chairman Mao!" and "Down with the new revisionists!"

Speakers emphasized that the armed peasant struggle in Naxalbari, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, has pointed out the true path for the Indian people to achieve liberation. They denounced the so-called United Front government of West Bengal for suppressing the Naxalbari peasant movement and condemned the Indian Communist revisionists in the government for spreading illusions about parliamentary democracy, attempting to make the exploited people forget class struggle.

The speakers pointed out that the fact that the leaders of the Indian National Congress hold knives in their hands is clear to all. However, the Indian Communist revisionists wear the mask of revolution, playing a destructive role in the revolution and conspiring to paralyze the communist movement in India.

A resolution passed at the mass rally stated that the fundamental reform of the land system is the most urgent task at present, and this task must be accomplished through the peasant revolution.

The meeting denounced the Indian reactionary government for relying on the police to forcibly collect rice from the peasants and called on the peasants to resist the forcible collection of grain.

The meeting also demanded an end to the West Bengal government's policy of suppressing workers and peasants, and the release of the leaders of the Naxalbari movement who have been arrested.

    印共革命派庆祝十月革命五十周年
    毛主席领导着世界人民进行革命
    新华社十四日讯　新德里消息：印共革命派组织的“援助纳萨尔巴里农民斗争委员会”十一日在加尔各答广场举行群众大会，庆祝十月革命五十周年。会议高度赞扬毛主席高举十月革命的伟大旗帜，领导全世界人民进行革命，并且强烈谴责苏修领导集团背叛马克思列宁主义，奉行修正主义政策。
    大会主席台上悬挂着毛泽东主席和列宁、斯大林的画像，参加会议的群众不断高呼：“向毛泽东致以红色的敬礼！”“打倒新修正主义者！”
    发言者强调指出，在毛泽东思想指引下开展的纳萨尔巴里农民武装斗争，指出了印度人民获得解放的真正道路。他们谴责西孟加拉邦所谓统一阵线政府镇压纳萨尔巴里农民运动，谴责参加这个政府的印共修正主义分子极力散布对议会民主的幻想，妄图使被剥削人民忘记阶级斗争。
    发言者指出，国大党领导人手里拿着刀，这是明摆着的事实。但是印共修正主义者戴着革命的假面具，起着破坏革命的作用，阴谋瘫痪印度的共产主义运动。
    这个群众大会上通过的一项决议指出，土地制度的根本改革是当前最紧急的任务，这项任务必须通过发动农民革命来实现。
    大会谴责印度反动政府依靠警察对农民强行征收稻米，号召农民对强征粮食进行抵抗。
    大会还要求制止西孟加拉邦政府镇压工农的政策，要求释放被捕的纳萨尔巴里运动领导人。
