The theoretical journal of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania, "The Party Road," in its eleventh issue, published an editorial entitled "In the Struggle Against Khruchov Revisionism, Defend and Advance the Cause of the October Socialist Revolution."

The editorial states that the victory of the October Revolution opened a new era in world history and world revolution. The experience of the October Socialist Revolution proves that the working class can only overthrow the bourgeoisie and seize power through revolutionary violence and armed struggle, thereby establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. It proves that only by completely destroying the bourgeois state bureaucracy and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat can the fruits of the revolution be safeguarded and the construction of socialism and communism ensured. It proves that only a strong party, armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, closely linked with the broad masses of the people, and steel-like united in thought and action, can advance the cause of the proletarian revolution to victory. The October Revolution proves that in order to achieve victory in the socialist revolution, safeguard the fruits of socialist victory, consolidate the system of proletarian dictatorship, and accelerate the victory of revolution over counter-revolution and socialism over capitalism on a global scale, it is necessary to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against opportunism and revisionism until opportunism and revisionism are completely smashed in thought and politics.

The editorial says that the attitude towards the experience and cause of the October Revolution has been and remains the touchstone and dividing line between Marxist-Leninists, true revolutionaries, and the traitors and enemies of Marxism-Leninism, revolution, and socialism—the old and modern revisionists. In this regard, Marxism-Leninism has been and is engaged in a life-and-death struggle with old and modern revisionism. The modern revisionists, centered around the traitorous group of the CPSU, from Khrushchev to the current revisionist leaders Brezhnev and Kosygin, not only repeat the theories of the old revisionists but also in practice betray the cause of revolution and socialism, betray the teachings and cause of the great October Socialist Revolution. In contrast to the teachings of the October Revolution, the Khrushchev revisionists deny that violent revolution is the universal law of proletarian revolution, advocating that within the framework of bourgeois democracy, constitution, and law, by gaining a majority in the bourgeois parliament through elections, one can transition to socialism. They deny that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental issue of revolution and socialism, advocating that capitalist states can change their class nature and serve the socialist transformation of society. They claim that it is also possible to transition to socialism under the leadership of other non-communist parties and organizations. Is this not a blatant betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and the fundamental teachings of the October Revolution?

The editorial says that the revisionist traitor group in the Soviet Union, in its domestic policy, has been and is pursuing a policy of betraying the Soviet people, causing the Soviet socialist system to degenerate and change, and restoring capitalism in the Soviet Union, thereby gradually eliminating the fruits of the October Revolution achieved by the Soviet people under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin and Stalin. In foreign policy, the Soviet revisionist ruling group has gone even further on the path of betraying Marxism-Leninism, socialism, and the interests of the peoples of all countries, intensifying cooperation with U.S. imperialism, suppressing the freedom of the peoples of all countries, and opposing Marxism-Leninism and true revolutionaries. The cooperation and alliance between the Soviet Union and the United States are directed against the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people, and the People's Republic of China, against the Party of Labour of Albania, the Albanian people, and the People's Republic of Albania, and against all true Marxist-Leninists and anti-imperialist forces in the world.

The editorial points out that the true heirs of the great October, the thoughts and teachings of Lenin and Stalin, and the revolutionary cause are the Marxist-Leninist parties and forces that are waging a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the revisionist traitors, defending and advancing the great revolutionary cause. Our Party is convinced that the revolutionary communists of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people who overthrew the tsar and the Russian bourgeoisie and established the Soviet power, will not long endure the revisionist betrayal and will bravely take the path of resolute struggle to overthrow the revisionist traitor leadership. The holy internationalist struggle of the revolutionary communists of the Soviet Union will forever receive the internationalist support and solidarity of all Marxist-Leninist parties and forces in the world. Today, defending the thoughts, experience, and cause of the October Revolution from the attacks and betrayals of Khrushchev revisionism means defending Marxism-Leninism and the dictatorship of the proletariat, advancing the cause of the socialist revolution and the liberation of the peoples of all countries; it means bravely joining the struggle to expose and overthrow the revisionist traitor leadership within the party.

### 在反修斗争中把十月革命事业推向前进

    阿《党的道路》谴责苏修鼓吹“和平过渡”的谬论
    在反修斗争中把十月革命事业推向前进
    坚信苏联人民将走上为推翻苏修集团而坚决斗争的道路
    据新华社地拉那八日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央机关理论刊物《党的道路》第十一期就伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年发表题为《在反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义的斗争中保卫十月社会主义革命事业，并把它推向前进》的社论。
    社论指出，十月革命的胜利开辟了世界历史和世界革命的新纪元。十月社会主义革命的经验证明，工人阶级只有通过革命的暴力，通过武装斗争，才能够推翻资产阶级，把政权掌握在自己手里，建立无产阶级专政。它证明，只有根本摧毁资产阶级的国家官僚机器，建立无产阶级专政，才能保卫革命的胜利果实，保证顺利地建设社会主义和共产主义。它证明，只有以马克思列宁主义理论武装的、同广大人民群众有血肉联系的、在思想上和行动上钢铁般团结的坚强的政党，才能把无产阶级革命的胜利事业推向前进。十月革命证明，为了顺利地取得社会主义革命的胜利，保卫社会主义的胜利果实，巩固无产阶级专政的制度，在全世界范围内，加速革命对反革命、社会主义对资本主义的胜利，应当展开一场反对机会主义和修正主义的坚决无情的斗争，直到机会主义和修正主义在思想和政治上彻底被粉碎为止。
    社论说，对待十月革命的经验和事业所采取的立场，过去和现在都是区别马克思列宁主义者、真正的革命者同马克思列宁主义、革命和社会主义的叛徒和敌人——老修正主义和现代修正主义者的试金石和分界线。在这方面，马克思列宁主义同老修正主义和现代修正主义曾经并正在展开一场你死我活的巨大斗争。以苏共叛徒集团为中心的现代修正主义者，从赫鲁晓夫到现在的修正主义头子勃列日涅夫—柯西金，不仅重复了老修正主义者的理论，而且实际上背叛了革命和社会主义事业，背叛了伟大十月社会主义革命的学说和事业。同十月革命的学说相反，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者否认暴力革命是无产阶级革命的普遍规律，宣传在资产阶级的民主、宪法和法律的范围内，通过选举在资产阶级议会中获得多数，就可以过渡到社会主义。他们否认无产阶级专政是革命和社会主义的根本问题，宣传资本主义国家可以改变其阶级性，可以为社会的社会主义改造服务。他们宣称在其它非共产主义政党和组织的领导下，也可以过渡到社会主义。这不是对马克思列宁主义和十月革命的根本学说的公开背叛吗？
    社论说，苏修叛徒集团在国内政策方面，已经和正在推行叛卖苏联人民、使苏维埃社会主义制度蜕化变质和在苏联复辟资本主义的方针，从而逐步消灭苏联人民在以列宁、斯大林为首的布尔什维克党领导下所取得的十月革命的果实。在对外政策方面，苏修统治集团在背叛马克思列宁主义、社会主义和各国人民的利益的道路上走得更远，加紧同美帝合作，镇压各国人民的自由，反对马克思列宁主义和真正的革命者。苏美合作和同盟的矛头指向中国共产党、中国人民和中华人民共和国，指向阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，指向世界上一切真正的马克思列宁主义者和反帝力量。
    社论指出，伟大十月和列宁、斯大林的思想、学说以及革命事业的真正继承者是正在同修正主义叛徒进行坚决的不可调和的斗争、保卫并把伟大革命事业推向前进的马克思列宁主义政党和力量。我们党坚信，苏联革命的共产党人、推翻过沙皇和俄国资产阶级，建立了苏维埃政权的苏联人民，绝不会长期忍受修正主义的叛变，将勇敢地走上为推翻苏修叛徒领导集团而进行坚决斗争的道路。苏联革命的共产党人的这一神圣的国际主义的斗争，将永远得到世界一切马克思列宁主义政党和力量的国际主义支持和声援。今天，捍卫十月革命的思想、经验和事业，使之免受赫鲁晓夫修正主义的攻击和叛卖，就是要捍卫马克思列宁主义和无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命事业和各国人民的解放事业推向前进；就是说要勇敢地投入揭露和打垮修正主义，推翻修正主义党内的叛徒领导的斗争。
