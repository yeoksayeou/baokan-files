Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To properly resolve the issue of superior-subordinate relationships, to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots level, walk around, and observe. They must adhere to the mass line, consult with the masses on all matters, and be students of the masses. In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

Cadres must go among the people. One of the profound achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the significant strengthening of the close ties between cadres and the broad masses of the people, and the great promotion of our Party's long-standing tradition of trusting the masses, closely uniting with the masses, and leading the masses forward.

We are a socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our cadres at all levels must represent the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the broad laboring people. The history of class struggle has shown that our cadres can only represent the fundamental interests and demands of the people if they maintain close ties with the masses and lead the masses down the socialist path. Throughout the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, due to the existence of class struggle and the old social forces of habit, if cadres become detached from the masses, they may be corrupted and infiltrated by class enemies and may turn into revisionists. Therefore, the condition of the cadre corps, whether cadres are connected with the masses or detached from them, directly relates to the consolidation and strengthening of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the fate of our regime.

Chairman Mao has always taught us: "People's work is different, their positions are different, but no matter how high the position, one must appear among the people as an ordinary laborer. One must not allow oneself to be arrogant."

The vast majority of our Party's cadres have followed Chairman Mao's teachings, sharing weal and woe with the masses and facing hardships together. However, there have been a few cadres who, in recent years, have thought that they have become "important officials" and have become arrogant, acting superior, and some even like to reprimand others, seriously detaching themselves from the masses. This has caused the masses to have complaints. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some people made mistakes and were criticized by the masses, and one of the fundamental reasons was this.

All cadres, whether old or new, whether they have made mistakes or not, must deeply learn from this lesson.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fundamentally speaking, is the line of coming from the masses and going to the masses. The opinions and experiences of the masses are the basis for our formulation of policies and the source of leadership thought. Any Party worker's good ideas, opinions, plans, and methods can only be a relatively correct concentration of the demands and wisdom of the broad revolutionary masses. If someone does not do this but is subjective, does not consult with the masses, and does not learn from the masses, they will definitely encounter setbacks.

Going among the people, consulting with the masses on all matters, and being students of the masses is not only a matter of work methods but also a fundamental stance, fundamental attitude, and worldview issue.

The representatives of the bourgeoisie and all exploiting classes in history have always distorted history, viewing the people as "ignorant mobs" and themselves as superior "officials." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, were exactly this kind of people who feared the revolutionary masses, suppressed the revolutionary masses, and betrayed the revolutionary people. Our cadres must draw a clear line with them on this fundamental issue, regarding themselves as one of the people, as faithful servants of the people, and as children of the people.

Cadres going among the people is a profound ideological revolution, a process of "criticizing selfishness and repudiating revisionism," and a lifelong endeavor. If you maintain close ties with the masses today, you will gain vigorous revolutionary spirit; if you weaken your ties with the masses tomorrow, your thoughts and feelings will change, and you will stagnate. Old cadres and new cadres must be vigilant about this and must persist for life in going among the people, thoroughly transforming their bourgeois worldview.

Cadres often make mistakes starting from being detached from the masses. To correct mistakes, the fundamental way is to go among the people and take the masses' criticism as a great driving force for the revolutionization of one's thoughts. A few cadres who have made serious mistakes can only be reformed by making self-criticisms to the masses and through the masses' criticism, education, and constant supervision, so as to discard the old and seek the new, make amends for past mistakes, and rejoin the revolutionary ranks.

Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the series of extremely important instructions he gave during the Cultural Revolution most concentratedly reflect the demands and wishes of the broad revolutionary masses, grasp the most important and crucial issues in the current revolutionary movement, and therefore possess boundless power. We broad revolutionary cadres must go among the people, directly propagate Chairman Mao's latest instructions to the broad masses, convey Chairman Mao's voice, and quickly turn Chairman Mao's instructions into the conscious revolutionary actions of the broad masses. At the same time, only by going among the people can we truly keep up with Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, deeply understand Chairman Mao's great strategic thought, and correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The revolutionary situation is constantly developing, and new things are emerging one after another. New issues are constantly being put on the agenda. To lead this great revolutionary movement well, we must be with the masses, constantly study the new trends, achievements, experiences, and problems in the movement, be good at discovering and advocating the revolutionary pioneering spirit of the masses, and strongly support the proletarian revolutionary factions determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Our cadres must be active and proactive in dealing with mass movements, be good at guiding them, and not be tailist; in dealing with problems that arise in mass movements, they must adhere to principles and handle them correctly.

In the current favorable situation, if cadres go among the people and be with the masses, first as students of the masses and then as teachers of the masses, summing up experiences, promoting achievements, correcting shortcomings, being modest and prudent, and guarding against arrogance and impetuosity, they will surely lead the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to new victories.

### 干部要到群众里面去

    要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。    毛泽东
    干部要到群众里面去
    无产阶级文化大革命的一个具有深远意义的伟大成果，就是极大地加强了干部同广大群众的密切联系，极大地发扬了我党一贯地信任群众，紧紧地和群众一道，并领导群众前进的优良传统。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，最近指示我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”
    干部同广大人民群众保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事。
    我们是无产阶级专政的社会主义国家。我们的各级干部，必须代表无产阶级和广大劳动人民的根本利益。阶级斗争的历史说明了：我们的干部只有密切联系群众，才能代表人民群众的根本利益和要求，才能引导群众走社会主义道路。在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期，由于阶级和阶级斗争的存在，由于旧的社会习惯势力的存在，干部如果脱离群众，就有可能被阶级敌人腐蚀侵袭，就可能出修正主义。因此，干部队伍的状况，干部是联系群众还是脱离群众，直接关系到无产阶级专政的巩固和加强，关系到我们的政权的命运。
    毛主席历来教导我们：“人们的工作有所不同，职务有所不同，但是任何人不论官有多大，在人民中间都要以一个普通劳动者的姿态出现。决不许可摆架子。”
    我们党的绝大多数干部，遵循毛主席的教导，和群众同甘苦，共患难。但是，也有少数干部，这些年来，自以为“官做大了”，自以为了不起，摆架子，有的还喜欢训人，严重脱离群众。这样，群众就有意见。在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些人犯错误，受到群众的批判，根本的原因之一，就在这里。
    一切干部，不论是老干部或新干部，犯过错误的干部或没有犯错误的干部，都要深刻地记取这个教训。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，从根本上说来，就是从群众中来，到群众中去的路线。群众的意见和经验，是我们制订政策的基础，是领导思想的源泉。党的任何工作人员，他们好的思想、意见、计划和办法，只能是比较正确地集中了广大革命的人民群众的要求和智慧。如果有人不是这样，而是主观主义，不同群众商量，不向群众学习，那就一定会碰钉子。
    到群众里面去，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生，这不仅是我们的工作方法问题，而且是一个根本立场、根本态度问题，是一个世界观问题。
    资产阶级和历史上一切剥削阶级的代表人物，总是颠倒历史，把人民群众看成是“无知的群氓”，把自己看成是高人一等的“官老爷”。在无产阶级文化大革命中被揪出来的以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资派，就是这样一批害怕革命群众、镇压革命群众、背叛革命人民的家伙。我们的干部，必须在这个根本问题上同他们彻底划清界限，把自己当作人民群众中的一个人，当作人民忠实的勤务员，当作人民的儿女。
    干部到群众里面去，是一场深刻的思想革命，是一个“斗私，批修”的过程，是一辈子的事。你今天同群众保持紧密的联系，你就能获得旺盛的革命斗志；你明天削弱了同群众的联系，思想感情就会起变化，就会停滞起来。老干部，新干部，都要警惕这一点，要终身坚持到群众里面去，彻底改造自己的资产阶级世界观。
    干部犯错误，往往是从脱离群众开始的。要改正错误，根本的途径，是到群众里面去，把群众的批评作为促进自己思想革命化的巨大推动力。少数犯严重错误的干部，只有向群众作自我批评，并经过群众的批评、教育和经常监督，才能得到改造，才能弃旧图新，将功补过，重新参加革命的行列。
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，毛主席在文化大革命中所作的一系列极为重要的指示，最集中地反映了广大革命群众的要求和愿望，抓住了当前革命运动中最重要、最关键的问题，因而具有无穷无尽的力量。我们广大革命干部，必须到群众中去，直接向广大群众宣传毛主席的最新指示，传达毛主席的声音，把毛主席的指示迅速变为广大群众自觉的革命行动。同时，也只有到群众里面去，才可能真正跟紧毛主席的伟大战略部署，深刻地理解毛主席伟大的战略思想，正确地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    革命形势不断发展，新生事物层出不穷，新的问题不断地提上议事日程。我们要领导好这场伟大的革命运动，就要和群众在一起，经常研究运动中的新动向，新成就，新经验，新问题，善于发现和提倡群众的革命首创精神，大力支持决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。我们的干部，对待群众运动，要积极主动，善于引导，不要尾巴主义；对群众运动中发生的问题，要坚持原则，正确处理。
    在当前大好形势下，干部到群众里面去，和群众在一起，先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生，总结经验，发扬成绩，纠正缺点，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，就一定能把无产阶级文化大革命引向新的胜利。
