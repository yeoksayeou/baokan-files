"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article titled "Grip the Guns in Hand, Use People's War to Eliminate the U.S. Imperialists and Thanom-Praphat Traitorous Clique" on the 20th, emphasizing that only revolutionary armed struggle is the only correct path to eliminate the enemy and liberate the people.

The article states that over the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Thailand, the armed struggle of the Thai people has developed rapidly. Currently, armed struggles are taking place in twenty-eight provinces across a vast area. Preliminary statistics show that over the past two years, the people's armed forces have annihilated more than 1,200 enemies.

The article states that in the face of the surging armed struggle of the Thai people, the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique are extremely panicked. They are carrying out frenzied suppression against the people's armed forces in an attempt to eliminate them, but they have not succeeded.

The people's armed forces in Thailand have not only not been eliminated but have grown stronger in the anti-"encirclement" battles, inspiring the people nationwide and becoming the people's hope.

The article emphasizes that if the people do not take up arms and engage in armed struggle, the people will never have a chance to rise up and will only be slaughtered by the enemy. Without the people's armed forces, the Thai people's patriotic democratic struggle against U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique will never achieve victory.

The article states that under the heavy blows of the Thai people's armed forces, the U.S. imperialists and the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, in order to maintain their reactionary rule and block the spread of the people's armed struggle, have recently been engaged in political deception, issuing a fake constitution, and holding fake elections, attempting to deceive the people and make them give up armed struggle. However, their deception will not fool the people.

The people have learned from their own experiences that only armed struggle is the path to expel U.S. imperialism, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, achieve true independence and democracy, and improve the people's lives.

The article states that the Thai people will never lay down their guns and will firmly continue the people's war until they drive the U.S. imperialist bandits out of Thai territory, overthrow the Thanom-Praphat traitorous clique, and build an independent and democratic new Thailand.

The article concludes by emphasizing that only by continuing to advance along the brilliant path of armed struggle can the people achieve true victory.

    “泰国人民之声”强调武装斗争是解放人民的唯一正确道路
    进行人民战争　消灭美泰反动派
    目前武装斗争已扩及到二十八个府　两年来人民武装歼敌一千多
    新华社二十二日讯  “泰国人民之声”电台二十日广播了一篇题为《紧握手中枪，用人民战争去消灭美帝—他侬集团》的文章，强调指出：只有革命的武装斗争，才是消灭敌人、解放人民的唯一正确的道路。
    文章说，两年多来，在泰国共产党领导下，泰国人民武装斗争获得了迅速的发展，目前武装斗争已在二十八个府的广大地区进行。据初步统计，两年多来，人民武装已经歼灭敌人一千二百多人。
    文章说，在泰国人民风起云涌的武装斗争面前，美帝和他侬—巴博卖国集团非常恐慌。它们对人民武装进行疯狂镇压，妄图消灭人民武装，但无法得逞。
    泰国人民武装不仅没有被消灭，反而在反“围剿”战斗中不断发展壮大，鼓舞了全国人民，成为人民的希望。
    文章强调指出，如果人民不拿起枪杆子，不进行武装斗争，人民就绝没有抬头的日子，而只能被敌人宰割。没有人民的武装，泰国人民反对美帝和他侬—巴博卖国集团的爱国民主斗争就绝不能取得胜利。
    文章说，在泰国人民武装的沉重打击下，美帝和他侬—巴博卖国集团为了保持它们的反动统治，阻挡人民武装斗争烈火的蔓延，最近它们又在大搞政治欺骗，要颁布伪宪法，举行伪选举，妄图欺骗人民，使人民受迷惑，放弃武装斗争。但是它们的这一骗局，是骗不了人民的。
    人民从自己的切身经验中体会到，只有武装斗争是驱逐美帝国主义，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团的唯一道路，是使国家取得真正的独立、民主，使人民的生活得到改善的唯一道路。
    文章说，泰国人民决不会放下手中枪，而且要紧握手中枪，坚决进行人民战争，直到把美帝国主义强盗赶出泰国领土，推翻他侬—巴博卖国集团，建设一个独立、民主的新泰国。
    文章最后强调说，只有决心继续沿着光辉灿烂的武装斗争的道路前进，人民才能获得真正的胜利。
