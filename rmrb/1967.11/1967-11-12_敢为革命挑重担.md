I have worked at the No. 3 Steel Plant for over a decade, serving as both the Party Committee Secretary and the Plant Director. Throughout my work, I have long neglected the political aspect, adhering to a revisionist line in enterprise management. During the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, I faithfully executed the bourgeois reactionary line. My mistakes are grave. After the entire plant's revolutionary masses repeatedly criticized and helped me, and through the revolutionary criticism and exposure of a small clique within the former Shanghai Municipal Party Committee who were taking the capitalist road, I deeply realized that my fundamental direction was wrong. I made a sincere self-criticism to the revolutionary masses, expressing my willingness to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

However, when the plant's revolutionary mass organizations and the stationed People's Liberation Army Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team proposed that I participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organ and take the lead, my response was straightforward: "The lead position should be held by the revolutionary faction." My first reason was: "In the past, I was arrogant and complacent, thinking I was quite capable. Since the Cultural Revolution, I realized that I am not good at grasping the overall direction. If I take the lead again, the Party's cause will suffer losses." My second reason was: "Can this person in power command the revolutionary faction?" I had a third reason that I did not express: "If I take the lead again, during the next movement, I will be the first target."

The revolutionary faction and the PLA comrades enthusiastically helped me, saying: "As long as you genuinely stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we believe you will grasp the overall direction and do a good job; as long as you act according to Mao Zedong Thought, we, the revolutionary faction, will firmly support you." The enthusiastic support and patient help from the revolutionary faction and the PLA comrades dispelled my doubts. The revolutionary faction also helped me to study and apply the "Three Articles," to fight against selfishness, and to resolve the thought issue that I did not express.

The core of the thought of "fearing to make mistakes" and "fearing to take the lead" is selfishness. "Passing the heavy burden to others and taking the light one. When faced with a task, first think for oneself and then for others." Isn't this the kind of cadre that Chairman Mao criticized? The revolutionary masses trust me and hope that I will shoulder the burden with them. How can I be trapped in the small circle of personal gains and losses, becoming a political mediocrity who seeks to preserve oneself as described in "On Practice"?

The great teachings of Chairman Mao and the enthusiastic help from the revolutionary faction finally made me discard selfishness, remove fear, and embark on the revolutionary journey again. In the past, I long adhered to production-first and business-first, even when serving as the Party Committee Secretary, I was more focused on business. Now, I focus my main efforts on revolution, on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, on implementing "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism," and on organizing the entire plant's Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

By adhering to political leadership, under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," our plant's production tasks have exceeded the plan every month. In the future, I am determined to study forever, change forever, and follow Chairman Mao forever, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry the revolution through to the end!

    敢为革命挑重担
    上钢三厂革命委员会主任委员原上钢三厂厂长  陈大同
    我在上钢三厂工作十多年，先后担任过党委书记和厂长。在工作中，我长期以来不突出政治，在企业管理上执行了修正主义路线；文化大革命运动初期，又忠实执行了资产阶级反动路线。我的错误是严重的。经过全厂广大革命群众对我进行了多次的批判和帮助，经过革命的大批判和对旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的揭发和斗争，我深深认识到我的大方向错了。我向革命群众进行了认真的检查，表示愿意回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    但是，当厂里的革命群众组织负责人和驻厂解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志提出要我参加革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，并要我担任第一把手时，我的回答很干脆：“第一把手，应该由革命派担任。”我的第一个理由是：“过去骄傲自满，自以为很行。文化大革命以来，知道自己掌握大方向不行。我再当第一把手，党的事业要遭受损失。”第二个理由是：“我这个当权派能不能指挥得动革命派？”我还有最后一个理由没有说出来：“再当第一把手，下次搞运动，第一个对象还是我。”革命派和解放军同志热情地帮助我，他们说：“只要你真正站到毛主席的革命路线上来，相信你会掌握大方向，会把工作搞好；只要你按毛泽东思想办事，我们革命派坚决支持你。”革命派和解放军同志的热情支持和耐心帮助，使我打消了思想顾虑。革命派又帮助我活学活用“老三篇”，狠斗“私”字，解决了我没有亮出来的思想问题。
      “怕犯错误”，“怕当第一把手”，这种思想的核心就是个“私”字。“把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”毛主席批评的，不正是我这种干部吗？革命群众信任我，希望我和他们一起挑重担，我怎么能够陷在个人患得患失的小圈子里，当《修养》里那种“明哲保身”的政治庸人呢？
    伟大领袖毛主席的教导和革命派对我的热情帮助，终于使我丢掉“私”字，去掉“怕”字，重新踏上了革命征途。过去，我长期是生产挂帅、业务当先，即使在担任党委书记时，也是热中于抓业务。现在，我以主要精力抓革命，抓活学活用毛主席著作，抓“斗私，批修”的落实，抓全厂的毛泽东思想学习班。
    由于坚持政治挂帅，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，我们厂的生产任务月月超额完成计划。今后我决心做到老、学到老、改到老、跟到老，永远跟着毛主席，永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把革命进行到底！
