    Do Not Defame the Soviet Red Army
    Soldier Li Qing of the People's Liberation Army

    "Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." The people's army is the sword with which the people seize power, and the Great Wall that protects it!

    Sholokhov, in order to cater to the needs of the Soviet revisionist leadership in pushing their revisionist political line, has been smearing the sword of the revolutionary war and digging holes in the Great Wall that defends the people's power. In his novel "One Man's Fate," he shamelessly defames the Soviet Red Army created and led by Lenin and Stalin.

    In this reactionary novel—

    There is no sight of the Soviet Red Army with high morale, sweeping all before it. Instead, there are red army positions surrounded on all sides, fleeing soldiers, and red army prisoners who "punch and kick" the German invaders, "curse and swear," and feel "comfortable" as if they were a "flock of sheep"!

    There is no sight of red army heroes with loyal hearts, charging into battle, and bravely fighting the enemy. Instead, there are cowards who write letters to their wives and lovers every day, whether there is news or not, filling the paper with tears and snot, saying they "have a hard time, are very painful, and are worried about being killed by the enemy"!

    There is no sight of red army heroes like Matrosov, who block enemy machine guns with their chests. Instead, there are shameless traitors who openly declare that "one's own life is most important," begging traitors not to "betray" their party comrade squad leader, and "heroes" like Sokolov who "legs tremble" and "fall down like a bundle of cut grass" at the sight of the German invaders!

    Enough! Sholokhov distorts the facts, tramples on history, and sells out the dignity and glory of the Soviet Red Army created and led by Lenin and Stalin. He stuffs the souls of traitors and the minds of slaves into the bodies of the red army, and boasts that he has shown the "new and lofty qualities" of Soviet soldiers. This is utterly reactionary!

    Chairman Mao said: "The Red Army soldiers have accomplished heroic deeds that concern the fate of all mankind. They are the children of the October Revolution. The banner of the October Revolution is invincible."

    The Soviet Red Army is a great people's army. It was born in the blazing fires of the October Revolution and grew in the stormy waves of the Great Patriotic War. The Soviet people used this sword to chop down the throne of the tsarist rule, cut off the claws of the fourteen invading countries, and established the first proletarian dictatorship in the world; with this Great Wall, they resisted the invasion of German fascism, broke the backbone of Hitler, and created great achievements for the liberation of the working people of the world!

    Under the nurturing of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Red Army produced countless towering heroes who were firm in their bones and hearts, unyielding to death, and whose spirits soared!

    Sholokhov's black novel has done a great favor for the Soviet revisionist leadership in seizing military power and restoring the old order. It helped the likes of Khrushchev defame the heroic image of the great Soviet Red Army. It helped the likes of Khrushchev inject the poison of revisionism and the rotten bourgeois ideology into the army, promoting peaceful evolution.

    Today, the power of the Soviet people has fallen into the hands of the man-eating devil. The iron boots of the new Soviet tsars trample on the Soviet people. The people are bleeding. To overthrow the rule of the new Soviet tsars, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will surely take up arms again, forge a new sword, rebuild the Great Wall, establish a true people's army, and launch a new storm of armed seizure of power to chop down the new tsars and create a new world!

    All erroneous thoughts, all poisonous weeds, and all ghosts and monsters must be criticized. They must not be allowed to spread freely.

    不准丑化苏联红军
    解放军某部五好战士　李庆
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”人民的军队是人民夺取政权的利剑，巩固政权的长城！
    肖洛霍夫为了迎合苏修领导集团推行修正主义政治路线的需要，使劲在革命战争的利剑上抹黑，竭力在捍卫人民政权的长城上挖洞。他在《一个人的遭遇》里，肆意丑化列宁、斯大林缔造的苏联红军。
    在这部反动的小说里——
    看不到斗志旺盛、横扫千军的苏联红军，看到的却是陷于四面楚歌的红军阵地，逃跑的败兵，和对德寇的“拳打脚踢”、“娘天娘地地乱骂”，“反而感到舒服”，“好象一群羊”的红军俘虏！
    看不到赤胆忠心、横戈跃马、英勇杀敌的红军勇士，看到的却是不论有事没事，天天给老婆情人写信，眼泪鼻涕把信纸也糊了，说什么他们“日子很难过，很痛苦，在担心给敌人打死”的怕死鬼的灵魂！
    看不到用胸膛堵住德寇机枪的马特洛索夫式的红军英雄，看到的却是公开宣称“到底自己的性命要紧”的无耻叛徒，苦苦哀求叛徒不要“出卖”自己的党员排长，和见到德寇就“两腿发软，身子象一束割下的草那样倒下来”的“英雄”索科洛夫！……
    够了！肖洛霍夫歪曲事实，践踏历史，把列宁、斯大林缔造和领导的苏联红军的尊严和光荣出卖一空，把叛徒的灵魂和奴才的心理塞进红军的躯体，还自吹是表现了“苏维埃士兵们如此崇高的新品质”，真是反动透顶！
    毛主席说：“红军战士做出了有关全人类命运的英雄事业。他们是十月革命的儿女。十月革命的旗帜是不可战胜的”。
    苏联红军是一支伟大的人民军队，她在十月革命的熊熊烈火中诞生，在卫国战争的惊涛骇浪里成长。苏联人民用这支利剑，砍倒了沙皇统治的宝座，斩断了十四国侵略者的魔爪，建立了世界上第一个无产阶级专政的国家；靠这座长城，抵御了德国法西斯的侵略，打断了希特勒的脊骨，为全世界无产阶级劳动人民的解放事业创建了丰功伟绩！
    在列宁、斯大林的哺育下，苏联红军涌现了无数顶天立地的英雄，他们骨硬心红，宁死不屈，气贯长虹！
    肖洛霍夫的这篇黑小说，为苏修领导集团篡夺军权、复辟变天帮了大忙。它帮助赫鲁晓夫之流丑化伟大的苏联红军的英雄形象，它帮助赫鲁晓夫之流向军队灌输投降帝国主义的修正主义毒素和腐朽糜烂的资产阶级思想，推行和平演变。
    今天，苏联人民的政权落到吃人魔王的手中，苏修新沙皇的铁靴蹂躏着苏联人民。人民在流血。为着推翻苏修新沙皇的统治，苏联革命人民一定会重新拿起武器，再铸利剑，重建长城，建立一支真正的人民军队，重新卷起武装夺取政权的风暴，砍倒新沙皇，杀出新天地！
    凡是错误的思想，凡是毒草，凡是牛鬼蛇神，都应该进行批判，决不能让它们自由泛滥。
