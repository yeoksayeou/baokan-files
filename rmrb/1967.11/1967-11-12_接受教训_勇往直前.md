    Learn from Mistakes and Press On

    Chairman Mao teaches us: “Mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us somewhat wiser, and thus we can do things better.” Having made serious mistakes, one must seriously learn from them and press on. However, learning from mistakes should not be considered from a passive standpoint. For example, some people say, to avoid making major mistakes in the future, it’s better not to be an official; even if one is an official, one should not be the “top leader,” but rather a “regular official” or a “good official,” keeping a low profile. This puts the “self” first and is it really like a Communist Party member? This way of thinking itself is a big mistake.

    During the Cultural Revolution, through the exposure and criticism by revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, I gradually came to understand the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, and I learned what Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are, and what revisionism is; what socialism is and what capitalism is. I also realized that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, I had indeed carried out the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

    I must learn from my own mistakes, and at the same time, share these lessons with fellow revolutionaries. For example, regarding the issue of those who have been deceived, we must recognize that the contradictions between the two lines are irreconcilable, but we must also see that they have been deceived and that they are the masses. Initially, revolutionary comrades used methods such as transferring jobs and withholding bonuses to deal with some deceived masses. I had heart-to-heart talks with revolutionary comrades, telling them that in the past, I used coercive methods to deal with the masses, and the proletarian revolutionaries should not take this old road. Revolutionary comrades have a deep understanding of the past situation and are more willing to accept this lesson. For example, how to deal with officials who have made mistakes, I also discussed with revolutionary comrades how Chairman Mao allows officials to make mistakes and correct them. Only the Rongming line and the bourgeois reactionary line pushed by the Chinese Khrushchev treat officials as “once they make a mistake, they are finished.” In the past, I carried out the bourgeois reactionary line, treating people as “finished.” Now that we revolutionaries are in power, we must definitely do a better job according to Chairman Mao’s policy on cadres.

    Having learned from past mistakes, I firmly remember the fundamental principle: everything must be measured by Mao Zedong Thought. In dealing with revolutionary comrades, I am determined to be sincere, and in work, I will put forward any opinions I have at any time. I will share the lessons learned from mistakes as our new provisional power organ’s common wealth, care for and help each other, and do our work better.

    接受教训  勇往直前
    上海市仪表局革命委员会主任委员原上海市仪表局党委副书记

    毛主席教导我们：“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些。”犯了严重错误，要认真吸取教训，勇往直前。但是接受教训，不能从消极方面来考虑。比如有人说，为了今后不犯重大错误，还是不当干部；即使当干部，也不要当“第一把手”，还是当个“一般干部”，或者当个“老好干部”，明哲保身。这样“私”字当头，还象个共产党员吗？这样想本身就是一个很大的错误。
    在文化大革命中，经过革命派和革命群众对我的揭发和批判，我逐步地认清了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，懂得了什么是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，什么是修正主义；什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义。我也认识到，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，自己确确实实贯彻执行了中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线。
    我自己犯了错误要接受教训，同时也把教训告诉无产阶级革命派的同志们。比如对待受蒙蔽群众的问题，既要认清两条路线斗争的矛盾是不可调和的，又要看到他们是受了蒙蔽，他们是群众。开始时，革命派的同志对一些受蒙蔽群众采用了调换工作、扣发奖金等办法。我就跟革命派同志谈心，告诉他们，过去我就是用压服的方法整群众的，无产阶级革命派不能走这条老路。革命派同志对过去的情况是深有感受的，也就比较容易接受这个教训。又如怎样对待犯错误的干部，我也跟革命派的同志谈，毛主席是怎样允许干部犯错误、改正错误的，只有王明路线、中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的资产阶级反动路线，对干部才是“一犯错误就打倒”。我过去执行了资产阶级反动路线，就是把人“看死”了。现在我们革命派掌了权，就一定要更好地按照毛主席的干部政策办事。
    接受了过去犯错误的教训，我牢牢记住根本的一条，就是一切要用毛泽东思想来衡量。在与革命派同志相处中，我决心努力做到赤诚相见，在工作中有些什么意见，就随时提出来，把从错误中得出的教训，作为我们新的临时权力机构的共同财富，互相关心，互相帮助，把我们的事情办得好一些。
