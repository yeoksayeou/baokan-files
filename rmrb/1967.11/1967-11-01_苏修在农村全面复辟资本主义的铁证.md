Over the past decade, the Soviet revisionist renegade clique has implemented a comprehensive set of revisionist policies domestically, fully restoring capitalism. In the agricultural sector, they have vigorously cultivated a privileged class in the countryside, relentlessly enforced the capitalist "profit principle," abolished the socialist planning system, and actively promoted and developed private economies. They have encouraged the free buying and selling of agricultural products, allowing capitalist forces to run rampant in the Soviet countryside, completely destroying the socialist production relations. Today, the Soviet countryside no longer has socialist public ownership, but is entirely replaced by the ownership of the privileged class and the new rich peasant economy. The broad masses of peasants are once again plunged into a state of exploitation and oppression.

	Farms and State Farms Become the "Territory" of the Privileged Class

Lenin said: "In a revolution, it often happens that the landlords and capitalists are swept away, but in a short time, new capitalists emerge from the rich peasants, wealthy peasants, and speculators, who often oppress the workers more harshly than the old landlords and capitalists."

For many years, the Soviet revisionist clique has repeatedly purged and replaced the leaders of farms and state farms, demoting many old cadres and installing a large number of bourgeois elements and so-called "experts" in key positions within farms and state farms. They have granted these individuals various privileges, forming a new privileged class in the countryside. This group controls all the power in the grassroots economic organizations of the countryside, using various "legal" and illegal means to embezzle a large amount of the peasants' labor fruits.

Now, the chairmen of Soviet farms can determine their own wages based on the so-called "planned cash income." The fixed income of farm managers is tens of times higher than that of ordinary members. According to the book "Legal Remuneration of Collective Farms" by Shabekov, in Kazakhstan, out of twenty-seven investigated farms, eleven farm chairmen's wages were fifteen to nineteen times higher than those of the members. The chairman of the "Baku Worker" farm in Azerbaijan earned an average of 1,076 rubles per month in 1965, the chief accountant earned 756 rubles, while the remuneration of ordinary members was less than 38 rubles. The chairman of the "Lenin's Path" farm in Tambov, Russian Federation, set his own monthly salary at 950 rubles, becoming a "recognized rich man." The salaries of state farm managers are similarly high, with some earning up to 300 rubles per month. Regardless of the harvest, farm and state farm managers and experts receive full pay, and their annual bonuses can be five to six times their monthly salary. Thus, the labor fruits created by the broad masses of farm members and state farm workers are channeled into the pockets of the privileged class through various means, becoming their personal income.

Farm and state farm managers, relying on their authority, engage in embezzlement and theft, living a life of decadence and luxury. A farm manager in Uzbekistan "treated the farm as his own territory," using farm funds for entertainment and leisure. Other managers in the farm also fabricated various excuses to embezzle farm funds. This group embezzled 170,000 rubles from the farm, leaving the "cashier's office empty," while many members did not receive their wages. The manager of the "Paris Commune Member" farm in Ivanovo, Russian Federation, embezzled enough money in one instance to "pay the wages of all members for a month." A state farm manager in Jambyl, Kazakhstan, privately appropriated 70 hectares of land and hired workers to cultivate it, with the wages paid by the state. A farm chairman in Azerbaijan built a sixteen-room villa with non-labor income, making it the most magnificent building in the entire district.

	Fully Implementing the "New System" with Profit as the Core

After seizing the leadership of the Soviet party and government, Khrushchev fervently advocated the role of profit incentives, claiming that the profit principle is the "key to further developing the economy of collective farms," and began to change the socialist agricultural planning system. As early as 1955, Khrushchev determined that the state would only be responsible for procurement, not production, abandoning supervision over farms and state farms. In 1958, he advocated the free procurement of agricultural products, giving farms and state farms free rein to pursue profits.

After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they went even further in this regard, doing more harm. They fiercely attacked the "top-down" formulation of agricultural production plans, claiming it constrained the creativity of farms and state farms, and proposed that farms and state farms be "completely independent and autonomous." They clearly stipulated the implementation of the "profit principle" in agriculture, declaring that the "profit rate level" is the "basis for evaluating the operational activities of collective farms and state farms," and requiring "state farms" to "implement the new system" and conduct "comprehensive economic accounting" in the short term.

In the past two years, the Soviet revisionist clique has further intensified their efforts to open the door for farms and state farms to pursue profits and engage in free operations through a series of resolutions and regulations. They allow all farms and state farms in the country to freely determine the direction of production development and annual production plans based on the principle of "developing the area with the highest profits," so as to give full play to their "initiative in choosing the most profitable (production) sectors."

In 1965, the Soviet revisionist clique began to experiment with the "new system" in some farms, and now more than 400 "state farms" have implemented the "new system" of "comprehensive economic accounting."

The core of the so-called "comprehensive economic accounting system" is profit supremacy, where profit is above all else. The Soviet "Rural Life" newspaper bluntly stated the intention, saying that the purpose of the "comprehensive economic accounting system" is "high profits." The Soviet "Pravda" also published an editorial, advocating that the more profits a farm makes, the more funds the farm accumulates, the more wages the farm can pay to workers, and the more housing, clubs, and production buildings can be built. The Soviet revisionist clique's perverse actions are essentially a public announcement to let the capitalist law of profit regulate production and let free competition replace the planned economy.

According to Soviet revisionist publications, in the past few years, many farms and state farms in the Russian Federation, Moldova, and Belarus have reduced the sowing area of crops with lower profits in order to pursue profits, while increasing the sowing area of crops with higher profits; some have used various excuses to evade the delivery tasks, selling these products at high prices in the market; some have engaged in lucrative sideline businesses and speculation.

The Soviet ruling clique actively promotes the division of land to teams and the contract reward system in farms and state farms. They allocate nationalized land to small teams for long-term cultivation. These teams generally consist of three to five people, owning several agricultural machines and tens to hundreds of hectares of land. The farms and state farms only set production tasks, production costs, and remuneration for completing the plan for these teams. In reality, these teams have become independent production and economic accounting units. This contract system was originally learned from the United States by Khrushchev and was only experimented with in a few farms and state farms. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they promoted it nationwide and emphasized that in the future, they would "strive to develop" this system. In the past two years, they have further advocated "internal economic accounting" within "collective farms," stipulating that all products, including by-products, of each accounting unit are commodities, establishing the relationship between production teams and livestock farms entirely on capitalist commodity-monetary relations. This series of capitalist restoration measures has completely disintegrated the original socialist production relations in Soviet agriculture, turning farms and state farms into capitalist agricultural enterprises.

	Actively Promoting Private Economy and Encouraging Members to Engage in Sideline Businesses

During Khrushchev's rule, he emphasized that the private economy of peasants is an "extremely important source" of agricultural production, abolished the procurement method for peasant private economy products used during the Stalin era to limit spontaneous forces, and gave significant concessions to private livestock rearing in terms of taxes and feed. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they further intensified the promotion of private economy development. Their first measure in agriculture was to further relax restrictions on private plots and private livestock, advocating the "extremely important significance" of developing the private economy. They then repeatedly issued various laws and resolutions, abolishing various restrictions, ordering local authorities to provide loans, livestock, pastures, feed to individuals, helping individuals to cultivate private plots, transport fertilizers and products, etc. The order prohibiting urban residents from privately raising livestock was also abolished at the same time.

Under the encouragement and instigation of the Soviet revisionist clique, the area of private plots rapidly expanded. In the suburbs of Moscow, some farms originally allowed only 2.25 acres of private plots per household, which has now increased to 9 acres. Many places have also expanded private plots through various means such as encroachment, private division, and leasing. In Ukraine, a single district has seen over a thousand people illegally appropriating land in recent years, totaling 3,000 acres. Some "members" have as much as 255 acres of private plots. Those with too much private plot land to cultivate themselves "lease" or "hire people to cultivate," becoming new rich peasants.

At the same time, the development of private livestock has been extremely rapid. From January 1965 to January of this year, the number of privately raised cows increased by 1.4 million, including 500,000 dairy cows, and the number of sheep increased by 5.7 million. In some places, the number of privately raised livestock is more than double that of state farm livestock.

With the malignant expansion of private plots and private livestock, private products have rapidly increased. According to Soviet revisionist publications, currently, some agricultural products produced on private plots account for half to two-thirds of the total national production of these products. For example, potatoes account for 63%, fruits account for 54%, meat accounts for 40%, and eggs account for 67%. In other words, private products have surpassed the "public economy." Thus, the private economy has become the "main means of livelihood" for many peasants. According to Soviet revisionist publications, in some farms in Estonia, 70% to 80% of the members' income comes from the private economy. The household income of farm members in Ryazan, Russian Federation, has only one-fourth coming from the farm. The Soviet party publication also had to admit that "the private economy of many peasants has expanded excessively, and sideline businesses have become the main source of income."

Due to the continuous development of the private economy, a significant portion of the labor force in the Soviet countryside has become increasingly "disinterested" in the production of farms and state farms, spending most of their time on "personal sideline businesses." According to official Soviet disclosure, nearly half of the labor of collective farm members of working age is spent on private plots. In a special survey of 2,000 people in Azerbaijan, more than 60% of men are engaged in the private economy.

	Encouraging Free Buying and Selling of Agricultural Products and Allowing Free Markets to Spread Everywhere

Lenin said: "If there is a small economy and free exchange, then capitalism will emerge."

As early as during Khrushchev's rule, he actively advocated the principle of free buying and selling of agricultural products and the opening of free markets, aiming to "fundamentally change the economic relations between the state and collective farms," allowing farms to "freely buy and sell products at prices reflecting the level of production and labor productivity." He also strongly opposed using "administrative measures" to restrict market prices, allowing speculators to control the market, greatly promoting the growth of capitalist forces in the countryside.

Brezhnev and Kosygin went even further in this regard, using various measures to encourage free buying and selling and widely opening free markets. The Soviet revisionist clique publicly declared that "the state will use stable procurement prices to protect and stimulate the free procurement of agricultural products," and decided to significantly increase agricultural product procurement prices starting in 1965. They allowed farms and state farms to freely dispose of "excess" agricultural and livestock products, either selling them to the state at high prices or in free markets. At the same time, they formally announced that various commodities in free markets are sold at "prices formed in the market," abolishing the regulations that products sold in the market must have certificates; allowing the buying and selling of any products, including "excess" seeds, feed, and "surplus" production materials in free markets. They also required local authorities to greatly increase the number of new markets, renovate existing markets, build sales booths, warehouses, cold storage, and hotels for free markets, and allocate cars specifically for private transportation of goods. Recently, the Soviet revisionists also passed a resolution "On Further Developing Auxiliary Enterprises and Handicrafts in Agriculture," requiring farms and state farms to mass-produce various daily necessities, handicrafts, and building materials for free markets.

Under the encouragement and support of the Soviet revisionist clique, free markets have rapidly developed. According to official Soviet statistics, there are more than 7,200 registered free markets nationwide (excluding temporary fairs). Currently, urban residents in the Soviet Union increasingly rely on free markets for their food. In some regions and cities, the potatoes sold in free markets account for 80% of the local sales volume, vegetables account for 70%, eggs account for 50%, and meat accounts for 40%.

The Soviet free markets are bustling with business, with various food items displayed, while the shelves of state-owned stores are filled with "aged pickled foods," "rotten tomatoes, cabbages, and wilted old cucumbers." Some city stores are "empty for several days in a row." "Residents have to buy tomatoes, cucumbers, etc., at high prices from private merchants." Speculators take advantage of this, raising prices to "mythical heights." The "East Truth" newspaper admits that the vegetable trade in Tashkent has been "monopolized by speculators," who are "ecstatic and carefree, with no competitors." Some speculators engage in long-distance trade, operating throughout the country. For example, in many free markets from Kaliningrad in the northwest to Vladivostok in the far east, one can see people from the Caucasus, "who do business during the day and enjoy themselves in restaurants at night."

The various facts of the Soviet revisionist renegade clique's full-scale restoration of capitalism in the countryside have completely exposed the Soviet revisionists' false facade of "building communism." The broad masses of the Soviet people, with the great tradition of the October Revolution, will not endure the exploitation and oppression of the bourgeois privileged class for long. One day, under the sun of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they will rise up in revolt against the Soviet revisionists, drive them out of the historical stage, and make them a pile of filth despised by humanity.

    苏修在农村全面复辟资本主义的铁证
    本报讯　十多年来，苏修叛徒集团在国内推行一整套修正主义的政策，全面复辟资本主义。他们在农业方面，大力培植农村的特权阶层，拚命贯彻资本主义的“利润原则”，取消社会主义的计划制度，大肆扶植和发展私有经济，放手鼓励农产品的自由买卖，从而使资本主义势力在苏联农村泛滥成灾，社会主义生产关系遭到彻底破坏。今日之苏联农村，社会主义公有制经济已不复存在，而完全为特权阶层所有制和新的富农经济所代替，广大农民群众又陷入受剥削、受压迫的水深火热之中。
              农庄农场成了特权阶层的“领地”
    列宁说：“在革命中常有这样的情形：地主和资本家被扫除了，但在很短时间内，从富农、富裕农民和投机者当中又产生了新的资本家，他们往往比旧的地主和资本家更厉害地压迫工人”。
    多年来，苏修集团对农庄和农场负责人进行一次又一次的清洗和撤换，把许多老干部打下去，把大批资产阶级分子和所谓“专家”安插到农庄农场负责岗位，赋予他们种种特权，形成农村新的特权阶层。这批人掌握农村基层经济组织的一切大权，通过各种“合法”和非法途径，大量侵吞农民的劳动成果。
    现在，苏联的农庄主席可以根据所谓“计划现金收入”自定工资，农庄负责人的固定收入比一般庄员高出十几倍，甚至几十倍。据夏别柯夫《集体农庄法定报酬》一书介绍，在哈萨克调查的二十七个农庄中，有十一个农庄主席的工资比庄员高十五倍至十九倍。阿塞拜疆共和国“巴库工人”农庄主席，一九六五年平均每月报酬一千零七十六卢布，总会计师七百五十六卢布，而一般庄员的报酬却不到三十八卢布。俄罗斯联邦坦波夫州“列宁之路”农庄主席竟然给自己规定每月工资九百五十卢布，成为“大家公认的财主”。农场场长同样实行高薪，他们的月薪有的高达三百卢布。农场负责人和专家不管收成好坏，都领全薪，而且全年的奖金可高达月薪的五、六倍。这样，广大庄员和农场职工所创造的劳动成果，就通过种种渠道，落入特权阶层的腰包，转化为他们的私人收入。
    农庄和农场负责人依仗权势，贪污盗窃，过着奢侈腐化的资产阶级生活。乌兹别克一个农庄的负责人“把农庄当作自己的领地”，他请客、玩乐都伸手从农庄拿钱。这个农庄的其他管理人员也编造各种借口骗取农庄的卢布。这伙人窃取农庄十七万多卢布，使“出纳处一空如洗”，许多庄员的工资却分文不付。俄罗斯联邦伊凡诺沃州“巴黎公社社员”农庄负责人，一次私吞的钱就“足够支付全体庄员一个月的工资”。哈萨克江布尔州一农场负责人私分土地达七十公顷，并雇工耕种，工资由公家支付。阿塞拜疆一个农庄主席用非劳动收入建造了十六间房的别墅，使整个区内没有一所房子能和“这座建筑媲美”。
             全面推行以利润为核心的“新体制”
    赫鲁晓夫在篡夺苏联党政领导权之后，就狂热鼓吹利润刺激的作用，胡说什么利润原则是“进一步发展集体农庄经济任务的关键”，并着手改变社会主义农业计划制度。早在一九五五年，赫鲁晓夫就确定国家只管收购，不管生产的作法，放弃对农庄和农场的监督。一九五八年，他又提倡农产品自由采购制度，为农庄和农场追逐利润大开绿灯。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后，在这方面比他们的前辈走得更远，干得更凶。他们大肆攻击“自上而下”地制订农业生产计划，束缚了农庄和农场的创造精神，提出农庄和农场“完全独立自主”。并明确规定在农业中推行“利润原则”，宣布“赢利率水平”是“评价集体农庄和国营农场经营活动的基础”，要求“国营农场”在短期内“实行新体制”，进行“全面经济核算”。
    最近两年来，苏修集团又通过一系列决议、条例，变本加厉地为农庄和农场追逐利润、自由经营敞开大门。他们让全国农庄和农场本着“那方面赢利最多，就发展那方面生产”的原则，自由确定生产发展方向和每年的生产计划，以便发挥它们“在选择最能赢利的（生产）部门方面的主动性”。
    一九六五年，苏修集团就开始在一些农场进行“新体制”的“试验”，至今已有四百多个“国营农场”实行“全面经济核算”的“新体制”。
    所谓“全面经济核算制”的核心，就是利润挂帅，就是利润高于一切。苏修《农村生活报》一语道破真意，说“全面经济核算制”的“目的就是高额赢利”。苏修《真理报》也发表社论，鼓吹农场“获利越多，那么农场积累的资金就越多，农场向工人支付的工资就可能越多，就可以建设更多的住房、俱乐部和生产建筑物”。苏修集团这种倒行逆施，实质上就是公开宣布让资本主义的利润规律调节生产，让自由竞争代替计划经济。
    据苏修报刊透露，过去几年来，俄罗斯联邦、摩尔达维亚和白俄罗斯等共和国的许多农庄和农场，为了追求利润，有的任意减少赢利少的农作物的播种面积，而多种赢利多的农作物；有的“以种种借口逃避完成”交售任务，而“把这些产品送到市场上高价销售”；有的则大搞赚钱的副业，大搞投机倒把。
    苏修统治集团在农庄和农场中积极推行分田到组、包产奖励制度。他们把国有化的土地，长期固定给小组耕种。这种小组一般三、五个人，拥有若干农业机器，几十公顷到几百公顷土地。农庄、农场只给它们规定生产任务、生产费用和完成计划应得的报酬。实际上，这些小组已成为独立的生产和经济核算单位。这种包产制度，原是赫鲁晓夫从美国学来的，当时只在少数农庄、农场进行试验。勃列日涅夫、柯西金一上台就在全国推广，并强调今后将“竭力发展”这种制度。最近两年来，他们又提倡“集体农庄”中进一步发展
  “内部经济核算”，规定各核算单位，所有的产品，包括副产品在内，都是商品，把各生产队、畜牧场之间的关系，完全建立在资本主义的商品货币关系之上。这一系列资本主义复辟措施，彻底瓦解了苏联农业中原先的社会主义生产关系，使农庄农场完全变成了资本主义的农业企业。
           大力扶植私有经济　鼓励庄员大搞副业
    在赫鲁晓夫当政时，就强调农民的私有经济是“农产品生产极其重要的来源”，取消了斯大林时期为限制自发势力采用的对庄员私有经济征购农产品的办法，并在税收、饲料等方面给私养牧畜以很大照顾。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流上台后，变本加厉地扶植私有经济的发展，他们在农业方面采取的第一个措施，就是进一步放宽对自留地和私养牲畜的限制，宣传发展私有经济有“极其重要的意义”。继而三令五申颁布各种法令、决议，取消各种限制，责成各地向私人提供贷款、牲畜、牧场、饲料，帮助私人耕种自留地，运送肥料和产品等。有关禁止城市居民私养牲畜的命令，也同时取消。
    在苏修集团的鼓励和怂恿下，自留地面积迅速扩大。莫斯科市郊有的农庄每户原先只许有二点二五亩自留地，目前增加到九亩。许多地方还通过侵占、私分、租用种种办法，扩大自留地。乌克兰仅一个区最近几年就出现了一千多擅自把土地占为己有的人，他们侵占的土地达三千亩。有的“庄员”自留地竟多达二百五十五亩。有的因自留地过多，自己种不了就“出租”或“雇人耕种”，成了新富农。
    同时，私养牲畜的发展极为迅速。从一九六五年一月至今年一月，私养牛增加了一百四十万头，其中奶牛增加五十万头，绵羊增加五百七十万头。在有些地方，私养牲畜甚至比农场牲畜多一倍以上。
    随着自留地和私养牲畜的恶性膨胀，私人产品急剧增长。据苏修报刊报道，现在全苏自留地上生产的一些农产品约占全国这些产品总产量的二分之一至三分之二。如土豆占百分之六十三，水果占百分之五十四，肉类占百分之四十，蛋类占百分之六十七。也就是说，私人产品已经压倒了“公有经济”。由此，私有经济成了许多农民“生活的主要手段”。据苏修报刊透露，爱沙尼亚的一些农庄，庄员百分之七十到八十的收入来自私有经济。俄罗斯联邦梁赞州农庄庄员的家庭收入，只有四分之一来自农庄。苏修党刊也不得不承认，“不少农民的私人经济过分膨胀，副业变成了收入的主要来源”。
    由于私有经济日益发展，目前苏联农村中很大一部分劳动力，对农庄、农场的生产越来越“失掉兴趣”，而把大部分时间花在“个人副业”上面。据苏修官方透露，集体农庄适合劳动年龄的庄员把将近一半的劳动花在自留地上。阿塞拜疆共和国在一次对两千人的专门调查中，有百分之六十以上的男人从事私有经济。
          鼓励农产品自由买卖　让自由市场到处泛滥
    列宁说：“既然存在着小经济，既然存在着交换自由，也就会产生资本主义”。
    早在赫鲁晓夫执政期间，他就积极提倡农产品自由买卖原则和开放自由市场，要“根本改变国家和集体农庄之间的经济关系”，让农庄“按着反映生产和劳动生产率水平的价格，自由买卖产品”。他并极力反对用“行政手段”限制自由市场价格，纵容投机倒把分子控制市场，大大促进了农村资本主义势力的滋长。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，在这方面则大大超过他们的前辈，他们上台后，采用种种措施，千方百计地鼓励自由买卖，广开自由市场。苏修集团公开宣称“国家将用稳定的收购价格来保护和刺激农产品自由收购”，并决定从一九六五年起大幅度提高农产品收购价格。他们允许农庄和农场自行处理“超计划”的农畜产品，或向国家高价出售，或在自由市场上出卖。同时，正式宣布自由市场上各种商品按“市场上形成的价格”出售，取消有关在市场上出售产品必须持有证明文件的规定；允许在自由市场上买卖任何产品，包括农庄、农场“多余的”种子、饲料和“剩余的”生产资料。还要求各地大量增辟新市场，改建现有市场，为自由市场修建售货亭、仓库、冷藏库和旅馆，并拨出汽车专供私人运货。不久前，苏修又通过一项《关于在农业中进一步发展附属企业和手工业》的决议，要求农庄和农场为自由市场大批生产各种日用品、工艺品和建筑材料等。
    在苏修集团的鼓励和扶植下，自由市场迅速发展起来。按苏修官方统计，全苏登记备案的自由市场即达七千二百多个（不包括临时集市）。目前苏联城市居民的副食品越来越靠自由市场供应。有些地区和城市自由市场销售的土豆，占当地销售量的百分之八十，蔬菜占百分之七十，鸡蛋占百分之五十，肉类占百分之四十。
    苏联自由市场上生意兴隆，各种副食品琳琅满目，而国营商店的货架上，摆的却是些“陈年醋渍食物”，“腐烂的西红柿、白菜和枯萎的老黄瓜”。有些城市的商店里，“一连几天都是空空的”。“居民不得不按高昂价格在私商那里购买西红柿、黄瓜等”。投机商利用这一点，把价格提到“神话般的高度”。《东方真理报》承认，塔什干的蔬菜买卖“已被投机商垄断”，“他们欣喜若狂，逍遥自在，没有竞争者”。有些投机商人长途贩运，活动遍及全国。例如，从西北的加里宁格勒到远东的海参崴的许多自由市场上，都可以看到外高加索人，“他们白天做买卖，而晚上在饭馆里作乐”。
    苏修叛徒集团在农村全面复辟资本主义的种种事实，完全戳穿了苏修所谓“建设共产主义”的假面具。具有伟大十月革命传统的苏联广大劳动人民决不会长期忍受资产阶级特权阶层的盘剥和欺压，终有一天会在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的阳光普照下，高举十月革命的旗帜，起来造苏修的反，把他们赶出历史舞台，使他们成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
