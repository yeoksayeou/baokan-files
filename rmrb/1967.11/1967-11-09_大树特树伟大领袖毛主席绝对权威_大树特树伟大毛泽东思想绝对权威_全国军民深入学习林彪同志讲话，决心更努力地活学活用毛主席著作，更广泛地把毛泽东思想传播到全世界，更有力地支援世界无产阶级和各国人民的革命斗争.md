The entire nation's military and civilians are deeply studying Comrade Lin Biao's speech, determined to more diligently apply Chairman Mao's works, to spread Mao Zedong Thought more widely across the globe, and to more powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the world's proletariat and peoples of all countries.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, November 8th -- Revolutionary masses, revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and the vast number of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country are continuing to extensively and deeply study the extremely important speech made by our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, at the capital's commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. They are determined to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to more diligently study and master Mao Zedong Thought, to highlight and establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, and to highlight and establish the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought. They vow to let the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, which blazes with eternal brilliance, be planted all over China and all over the world!

	Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in various places excitedly say that in our hearts, the reddest of the red suns, Chairman Mao, has comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, it is the Marxism-Leninism that makes contemporary imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries tremble with fear, and it is the most powerful ideological weapon of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. They say, the fact that the Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed the cause of the October Revolution tells us that to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most fundamental thing is to study and master the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. We must raise our awareness of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works a thousand times and ten thousand times, and use Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds. This is the fundamental guarantee for carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, preventing the restoration of capitalism, and it is the fundamental guarantee for thoroughly burying all systems of exploitation and achieving the victory of communism in the world.

	Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Beijing, Shanghai, Shandong, Jiangxi, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, Hubei, Anhui, Zhejiang, Gansu, Ningxia, Hunan, Sichuan, Jilin, Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Guangdong, Xinjiang, and other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities have held discussions and study sessions in recent days to seriously study Comrade Lin Biao's important speech and the article "Advancing Along the Path Opened by the October Socialist Revolution" published by the editorial departments of the People's Daily, Red Flag Magazine, and the Liberation Army Daily. Some provincial and municipal revolutionary committees have also held special study meetings. After seriously studying Comrade Lin Biao's extremely important speech, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held a regional wired broadcast conference on the 7th, calling on the 13 million people of all ethnic groups in the region to take immediate action, launch a more extensive and in-depth campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and strive to achieve new levels of study and application.

	Revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the country have firmly expressed during their study of Comrade Lin Biao's speech that they will unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, take "criticize revisionism and repudiate self" as the guiding principle, extensively and deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, and politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize and expose the clique of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, led by China's Khrushchev. They will consolidate and develop the revolutionary three-in-one combination and revolutionary great alliance, do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their local areas and units, achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, build our great motherland into an even stronger base for world revolution, and better fulfill our internationalist duty to support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world. Revolutionary masses in some places have been studying Comrade Lin Biao's speech while summarizing the revolutionary and work experience of the previous stage, closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, formulating new battle plans, focusing on the revolution, vigorously promoting production, and striving for victory in both revolution and production. In accordance with the latest instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, Red Guards and revolutionary students who are currently at the forefront of the educational revolution across the country have been repeatedly studying Vice Chairman Lin Biao's important speech in the past two days. They proudly express that under the leadership of the supreme commander Chairman Mao, we are engaged in an extremely glorious and great cause that our predecessors have never done before. We will resolutely take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, launch a high tide of proletarian educational revolution, resolutely become pioneers of the educational revolution, and strive to create a proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	In recent days, the vast number of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces have been seriously studying Vice Chairman Lin Biao's extremely important speech. Many units have also sent Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams to go deep into rural areas, factories, offices, and schools to hold discussions and exchanges with the broad revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses of the proletariat, and Red Guards. Officials and soldiers of the National Defense Science Commission, National Defense Industry Office, and other units have pointed out with great enthusiasm that we live in a new era of revolution with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, and we are doing revolution under the leadership of the great teacher of the contemporary world proletariat, Chairman Mao. This is our greatest happiness. We will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implement Mao Zedong Thought, enthusiastically propagate Mao Zedong Thought, defend Mao Zedong Thought with our lives, highlight and establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and let the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shine over all of China and all over the world. Active learners of Chairman Mao's works, Feng Fusheng and Sun Leyi, the iron-willed soldier Zhang Chunyu of the Railway Corps, the good soldier of Chairman Mao, Nian Siuwang, the meritorious combatant Dong Xiaohai of a certain unit of the Air Force, and the soldiers and officers of the "August First" Battalion, etc., have unanimously pointed out that the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in the world, and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, will greatly accelerate the process of world proletarian revolution. Soldiers and officers of the Beijing, Jinan, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, Shenyang, Fuzhou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Kunming units, and the Xinjiang and Tibet Military Regions have said, Mao Zedong Thought is the most powerful weapon of the world's revolutionary peoples. We must more widely spread Mao Zedong Thought across the globe and powerfully support the revolutionary struggles of the world's proletariat and peoples of all countries against imperialism, against modern revisionism, and against the reactionaries of all countries. The great cause of the dictatorship of the proletariat opened by the October Revolution will definitely achieve victory all over the world.
