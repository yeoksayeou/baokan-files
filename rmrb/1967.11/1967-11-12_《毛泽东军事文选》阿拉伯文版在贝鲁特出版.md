The Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong in Arabic has recently been published in Beirut and is also being sold in Syria. This brilliant work has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary people of the Arab world. They say that Chairman Mao's works are powerful weapons and the most precious support from the Chinese people for the liberation struggle of the Arab people.

Since the imperialist aggression by the United States, Britain, and Israel against the Arab countries, the Arab people have felt even more deeply the guiding significance of Mao Zedong Thought for their anti-imperialist national liberation struggle. They eagerly study Chairman Mao's works, especially his military theories on people's war. After the Arabic editions of Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Problems of Strategy in Guerrilla War Against Japan" and "On Protracted War" were published in Syria in August, many Syrian revolutionary masses studied these great works with great enthusiasm. When the Arabic edition of "The Selected Military Works of Mao Zedong" was published, many Arabs regarded it as a great piece of news and spread the word.

Arab friend Mikhail said: Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary, revolutionary teacher, and genius proletarian military strategist of our time. He has brilliantly and creatively inherited and developed the military thought and people's war theory of Marxism-Leninism. This Arab friend also said: Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful weapon for the oppressed people to defeat the enemy. Chairman Mao pointed out that people's war is the only path to victory in the liberation struggle.
