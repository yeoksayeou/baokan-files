The armed forces led by the Communist Party of Burma and the armed forces of the National Democratic Front of Burma have, in recent months, extensively launched guerrilla warfare in various parts of Burma. In the struggle to smash the counter-revolutionary "encirclement" by the Ne Win reactionary government, they have achieved new victories one after another.

Since August this year, the people's armed forces of Burma have, in response to the Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied "encirclement" and "sweeping" of revolutionary base areas, ambushed the enemy, attacked enemy strongholds, and launched powerful counterattacks in many areas of Upper and Lower Burma. In the four administrative regions of Bago, Irrawaddy, Arakan, and Tenasserim in Lower Burma, there have been frequent reports of victories.

In August, the people's armed forces of Burma annihilated a platoon of reactionary police in a battle in the Minbu District of Upper Burma. On August 28, the people's armed forces attacked the Minbin railway station in the Thabeikkyin District of the Mandalay Administrative Region, burning down the station building. On September 7, the people's armed forces entered the town of Kyaunggon in the Arakan Administrative Region of western Burma, seizing a batch of weapons and a large amount of supplies from three warehouses of the Ne Win reactionary government. On September 12, the people's armed forces annihilated a platoon of reactionary police in the town of Myaungmya in the Tharrawaddy District, seizing some firearms. On October 12, the people's armed forces captured twelve policemen in the town of Pabedan in the Bago District.

Not long ago, the people's armed forces attacked a police stronghold in the town of Bawla in the Dawei District, annihilating twenty enemy soldiers and seizing twenty guns. The people's armed forces also seized twenty-five elephants and 290 tons of teak from the Ne Win reactionary government in the Tharrawaddy District. Under the continuous attacks of the people's armed forces, the reactionary military and police of Ne Win in the Tharrawaddy District were forced to withdraw from the Ebaw stronghold in October. On November 5, the people's armed forces of Burma attacked a combined patrol team of Ne Win's reactionary military and police in the Pyigyidagone area. Reactionary newspapers in Burma admitted that two soldiers were killed and one soldier was wounded. On November 10, the people's armed forces of Burma again attacked a combined patrol team of reactionary military and police departing from Mindon in Upper Burma, killing and wounding one reactionary soldier each.

At the same time, the people's armed forces of Burma have extensively entered the rural areas and towns occupied by the enemy, mobilizing the masses to fight against the Ne Win reactionary government. According to the demands of the masses, the people's armed forces executed several notorious reactionary village heads and policemen in these places. On October 28, the people's armed forces infiltrated the town of Zigon in the Tharrawaddy District, killing and wounding four reactionary policemen in a movie theater and seizing their weapons.

For several months, the people's armed forces of Burma have been active on the Rangoon-Mandalay and Rangoon-Pyay railway lines, destroying railways, blowing up bridges, and attacking enemy trains. On August 15, the people's armed forces in the Irrawaddy Delta destroyed several miles of railway in the Hinthada District, completely removing the rails and sleepers. On September 30, the people's armed forces destroyed the railway near the town of Pyaungson in the Bago District. On October 13, the people's armed forces ambushed an enemy train near the important town of Kyaukpadaung on the Rangoon-Pyay railway. On October 21 and 23, the people's armed forces blew up a train each on the Rangoon-Mandalay railway line near the towns of Sittwe and Myaungmya. In the battle on October 21, the people's armed forces, with more than 150 people, blew up a bridge and 300 feet of track, causing the locomotive and sixteen freight cars to derail.

The people's armed forces of Burma have also continuously attacked and intercepted the cargo ships and trucks of the Ne Win reactionary government on the coastal and inland waterways and on many roads. Recently, they have also blocked the road between the town of Tawau and the town of Ye in the Dawei District, causing traffic on this road to come to a standstill. (Accompanied by a picture)

The warriors of the people's armed forces of the Communist Party of Burma are in high spirits, intensifying their training, and are ready at any time to annihilate the enemy.
