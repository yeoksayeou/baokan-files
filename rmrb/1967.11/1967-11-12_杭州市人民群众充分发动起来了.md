Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hangzhou has achieved unprecedentedly good results after more than a year of intense class struggle.

A significant indicator of the excellent situation in Hangzhou's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is that the masses have been fully mobilized. Workers, students, cadres, and suburban farmers throughout the city, regardless of gender or age, all care about national affairs and have thrown themselves into this great revolutionary torrent. From factories to schools, from urban areas to suburbs, everywhere is a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. After more than a year of intense struggle, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the reactionary bourgeois line have been overthrown, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line has achieved decisive victory. The radiant Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating people's hearts.

Currently, various factories, schools, and institutions throughout the city have universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes. There are more than 1,200 such classes in factories and enterprises, not only at the factory level but also at the workshop and team levels, with over 30,000 participants. In the suburbs, 15 communes and nearly 300 production teams have also universally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes, with over 30,000 participants. Through these studies, the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought have been further established.

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres in Hangzhou listen most to Chairman Mao's words; they do as Chairman Mao says. They closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments and have achieved one victory after another in advancing the revolutionary criticism, great unity, and three-in-one combination. After Chairman Mao issued the directive that "within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions," the working class in Hangzhou swiftly responded. They first achieved revolutionary great unity across the city. Currently, 98% of the factories and enterprises in the city have united their revolutionary masses by system, industry, workshop, and team, effectively promoting the revolutionary criticism, struggle, and reform in various units. The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards in the city's primary and secondary schools have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call for revolutionary great unity among revolutionary Red Guards and revolutionary student organizations, sparking a high tide of revolutionary great unity. Recently, they have resumed classes and carried out revolutionary activities, ushering in a new high tide of educational revolution.

The revolutionary cadres in Hangzhou have seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on cadre issues, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, and mobilized the masses extensively. Starting from education, they have strengthened political and ideological work on cadres, helping cadres who have made mistakes to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Many revolutionary leading cadres, under the call of Chairman Mao's cadre policy and with the help of the revolutionary cadres, have come forward after criticizing and rectifying their mistakes, standing shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary cadres and masses to fight together. This has created conditions for establishing a three-in-one combination temporary power organ in Hangzhou.

The development of the revolutionary situation has powerfully promoted the development of production. The revolutionary cadres and masses in Hangzhou have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," making the city's industrial and agricultural production situation better and better. In recent months, industrial production has been rising month by month. In October, the city's total industrial output value increased by 12% compared to September, with the average daily output level increasing by 21.5% compared to the third quarter's average daily output level. Product quality has been stable and improving, with new products continuously increasing. Especially in the machinery industry, electrical instrumentation industry, and transportation industry, the output value and transportation volume have significantly increased compared to the same period last year. The Hangzhou Boiler Factory and other factories have created the highest records in product output, quality, and variety since their establishment. In the suburbs, after the spring crops and early rice have shown significant increases, late rice is expected to be bountiful.

    杭州市人民群众充分发动起来了
    毛泽东思想日益深入人心，革命大批判、大联合、三结合取得一个又一个胜利，工农业生产形势越来越好
    据新华社杭州十一日电　在伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，经过一年多尖锐、激烈的阶级斗争，杭州市的无产阶级文化大革命出现了空前未有的大好形势。
    杭州市无产阶级文化大革命形势大好的一个重要标志，是人民群众充分发动起来了。全市的工人、学生、干部和郊区农民，不分男女老少，人人关心国家大事，都投入到这场伟大革命的洪流中来。从工厂到学校，从市区到郊区，处处都是革命大批判的战场。经过一年多的激烈斗争，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线垮台了，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线取得了决定性胜利，光焰无际的毛泽东思想越来越深入人心。
    现在，全市各工厂、学校、机关普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。工厂企业办的学习班就有一千二百多个，不仅厂一级办，车间办，班组也办，参加学习的有三万多人。郊区十五个公社近三百个大队，也普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班，有三万多人参加学习。通过学习，进一步树立了伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    杭州市的广大无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，毛主席怎么说，他们就怎么做。他们紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，在推进革命的大批判、大联合和三结合方面取得了一个又一个的胜利。毛主席发出“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织”的指示以后，杭州市的工人阶级闻风而动，首先在全市实现了革命的大联合。目前，全市百分之九十八的工厂企业的革命群众，已经按系统、按行业、按车间、按班组联合起来，有力地推动了各单位的大批判和斗批改。全市大中小学广大革命师生和红卫兵革命小将，热烈响应毛主席关于革命的红卫兵和革命的学生组织要实现革命的大联合的伟大号召，掀起了革命大联合的高潮。最近，他们陆续复课闹革命，正在掀起教育革命的新高潮。
    杭州市无产阶级革命派认真学习了毛主席关于干部问题的一系列指示，坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，广泛发动群众，从教育入手，加强对干部的政治思想工作，帮助犯错误的干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来。许多革命领导干部，在毛主席干部政策的感召下，在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，经过斗私批修，坚决地站了出来同无产阶级革命派和革命群众一道并肩作战，为杭州市建立三结合的临时权力机构创造了条件。
    革命形势的发展，有力地推动了生产的发展。杭州市的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，使全市工农业生产形势越来越好。近几个月来，工业生产月月上升。十月份，全市工业总产值比九月上升百分之十二，平均日产水平比第三季度的平均日产水平增长百分之二十一点五，产品质量稳定提高，新产品不断增加。特别是机械工业、电器仪表工业的产值和交通运输行业的运输量，都比去年同期显著增长。杭州锅炉厂等工厂的产品产量、质量和品种，都创造了建厂以来最高纪录。郊区农业生产在春收作物和早稻显著增长以后，晚稻丰收在望。
