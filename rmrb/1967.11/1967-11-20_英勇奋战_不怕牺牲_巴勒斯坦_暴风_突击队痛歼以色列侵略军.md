The brave and fearless "Storm" squad of Palestine has inflicted heavy casualties on the Israeli invaders. According to a recent battle report issued by the Palestinian nationalist organization "Storm," the "Storm" squad has been fighting bravely and fearlessly, intensifying attacks on the Israeli aggressors in the occupied Palestinian territories and achieving new victories. They have killed and wounded several Israeli soldiers, shot down three Israeli helicopters, destroyed three Israeli trains, several tanks, and military vehicles, and also damaged some of the enemy's factories and other facilities.

On the night of the 3rd, the "Storm" squad planted landmines on the Al-Ariha-Uga military road, blowing up a car from the Israeli military command, killing all the people inside.

On the 4th, a "Storm" squad in the town of Halil to the east of the West Bank of the Jordan River heavily attacked Israeli paratroopers. When the enemy's reinforcements arrived, the "Storm" squad launched a fierce counterattack, killing and wounding many enemy soldiers, destroying two enemy tanks and three armored vehicles, and then returning to their base.

On the 6th, the "Storm" squad blew up an Israeli military vehicle in the Besan Valley south of the Sea of Tiberias (on the West Bank of the Jordan River), killing and injuring seven Israeli soldiers in the vehicle.

On the 11th, the "Storm" squad blew up another Israeli military vehicle north of the Damia Bridge on the West Bank of the Jordan River.

On the night of the 13th, a "Storm" squad near the Halil Mountains on the West Bank of the Jordan River attacked an Israeli army camp with machine guns and rockets, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

On the morning of the 14th, the "Storm" squad blew up an Israeli vehicle assembly plant in the city of Nazareth on the West Bank of the Jordan River, damaging some of the plant's buildings and vehicles.

In a series of armed activities in the first half of this month, the Palestinian "Storm" squad has dealt a heavy blow to the tool of U.S. imperialism—Israel, making them anxious and fearful. The Israeli invaders have exclaimed that the "Storm" squad of Palestine is becoming "bolder and bolder."
