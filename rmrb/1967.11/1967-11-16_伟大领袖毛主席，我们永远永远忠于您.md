November 14, 1967, at 7:30 PM, was the most unforgettable, happiest, and most glorious moment of my life: my long-cherished wish to see the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, finally came true!

"Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" With tears of joy, my comrades and I shouted until our voices were hoarse, and our hearts pounded with excitement!

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! You understand the masses the best, care for the masses the most, and trust the masses the most, always keeping our hearts connected! When we rose up to fight against the capitalist roaders, it was your brilliant thoughts that gave us boundless courage and strength. When our struggle encountered temporary difficulties, it was you who gave us the greatest and most powerful support. Your brilliant thoughts nurtured our growth, showed us the direction to move forward, and guided us to victory after victory!

We swear to you: We will forever and ever be loyal to you! Forever and ever loyal to your brilliant thoughts! Forever and ever loyal to your proletarian revolutionary line! Forever and ever follow you! Wherever you point, we will resolutely fight! We dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. No matter who it is, no matter where they come from, if they dare to oppose you and your great thoughts, if they dare to oppose your revolutionary line and shake the proletarian headquarters led by you, we will resolutely fight them to the end and smash them completely! We firmly uphold your absolute authority, the absolute authority of your great thoughts, and the absolute authority of your revolutionary line.

We swear to you: We will definitely follow your instructions to conduct "Criticize and Repudiate" as the key task, and run Mao Zedong Thought study classes well. We will definitely study your brilliant works more diligently and assiduously, arm our minds with your great thoughts, and launch a great revolution in our souls to criticize and repudiate selfishness and promote public spirit. We will strive to change our worldview. We will definitely use your great thoughts as our weapon, follow your great strategic deployment, and carry out more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. We will resolutely criticize and expose thoroughly the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist roaders within the party in Anhui, eliminate their poisonous influence, and promote great unity and the three-in-one combination in the revolution.

Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin, always read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. No matter when, no matter what storms and waves we encounter, we will unwaveringly follow you! Forever follow you! Forever and ever follow you!

    伟大领袖毛主席，我们永远永远忠于您
    安徽省军区  刘必极
    一九六七年十一月十四日晚上七时三十分，是我一生中最最难忘，最最幸福，最最光荣的时刻：我日日夜夜盼望见到世界革命人民的伟大导师、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，这个愿望终于实现了！
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”我和同志们饱含着幸福的热泪，我们的嗓子喊哑了，我们的心激动得几乎跳出来了！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您最了解群众，最关心群众，最信任群众，永远同我们心连心！当我们起来同资产阶级反动路线作斗争的时候，是您老人家的光辉思想，给了我们无穷的勇气和力量；当我们的斗争遇到暂时困难的时候，又是您老人家给了我们最大的最有力的支持。您的光辉思想哺育着我们成长，您的光辉思想给我们指明了前进的方向，您的光辉思想引导我们夺取了一个又一个的胜利！
    我们向您老人家宣誓：我们永远永远忠于您！永远永远忠于您的光辉思想！永远永远忠于您的无产阶级革命路线！永远永远紧跟着您！您老人家指到那里，我们就坚决打到那里，刀山敢上，火海敢闯，不管是谁，不管来自哪一个方面，谁胆敢反对您和您的伟大思想，谁胆敢反对您的革命路线，动摇以您为首的无产阶级司令部，我们就坚决和他拚到底，彻底把它粉碎！我们坚定地大树特树您老人家的绝对权威，大树特树您老人家伟大思想的绝对权威，大树特树您老人家革命路线的绝对权威。
    我们向您老人家宣誓：一定要按照您的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，办好毛泽东思想学习班。我们一定更刻苦更勤奋地学习您老人家的光辉著作，用您老人家的伟大思想武装我们的头脑，在灵魂深处爆发一场破私立公的大革命，努力改造自己的世界观。我们一定以您的伟大思想为武器，紧跟您老人家的伟大战略部署，开展更广泛更深入的革命大批判，坚决把中国赫鲁晓夫及安徽地区党内一小撮走资派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们的流毒，促进革命的大联合，促进革命的三结合。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们一定遵照林副统帅的指示，永远读您的书，听您的话，照您的指示办事，做您的好战士。不论在什么时候，不管有什么惊涛骇浪，我们都坚定不移地跟您走！永远跟您走！永远永远地跟您走！
