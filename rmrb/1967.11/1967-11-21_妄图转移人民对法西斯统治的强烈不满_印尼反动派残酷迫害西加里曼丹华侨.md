The fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia has recently carried out horrifying atrocities against innocent Chinese residents in West Kalimantan.

According to reports from Western news agencies, starting from October 23, the reactionary military authorities in West Kalimantan, acting on the orders of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, openly dispatched armed forces in collaboration with reactionary Dayak leaders to implement a "scorched earth" policy of "kill all, burn all, loot all" against the impoverished Chinese residents who have lived in the vast rural areas of West Kalimantan for generations. An Associated Press dispatch from Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan, on the 19th revealed that so far, 30,000 Chinese residents have been driven from their homes, and many have been brutally murdered. The report said that in one village, 60 Chinese residents were hacked to death; in another village, 100 Chinese residents, along with their homes, were burned alive. Reuters reported that in the town of Singkawang, 34 impoverished Chinese residents were massacred in one incident.

The reactionary authorities in West Kalimantan have also targeted Chinese residents living in cities. They organized mobs to raid Chinese shops and residences, looting and burning them. They arbitrarily arrested innocent Chinese residents and wantonly destroyed Chinese homes, committing all manner of evil deeds.

The Indonesian fascist military regime attempts to shift the revolutionary people's strong discontent with its reactionary rule by brutally persecuting the broad masses of Chinese residents. However, this is utterly impossible. Where there is oppression, there is resistance. The fascist military regime's brutal persecution of the broad masses of Chinese residents in West Kalimantan will inevitably arouse more intense resistance from the Indonesian people and Chinese residents, thereby hastening its own downfall.

    妄图转移人民对法西斯统治的强烈不满
    印尼反动派残酷迫害西加里曼丹华侨
    新华社十九日讯  雅加达消息：印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权，最近在西加里曼丹对无辜华侨进行骇人听闻的残酷迫害。
    据西方通讯社报道，从十月二十三日起，西加里曼丹反动军事当局奉苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权之命，公然派遣武装部队伙同达亚克族反动头目，对历代居住在西加里曼丹广大农村的贫苦华侨实行杀光、烧光、抢光的“三光”政策。美联社十九日发自西加里曼丹首府坤甸的一条消息透露，到目前为止，已有三万名华侨被赶出了家园，许多华侨被残杀。消息说，在一个村庄，有六十名华侨被砍死；在另一个村庄，一百名华侨连同他们的房屋一起，活活地被烧死。路透社说，在锡纳坎镇，一次就有三十四名贫苦华侨被杀害。
    西加里曼丹反动当局对居住在城市里的华侨也下毒手。他们组织暴徒，冲进华侨商店和住宅进行掠夺。他们无理逮捕无辜华侨，疯狂地烧毁华侨房屋，无恶不作。
    印尼法西斯军人政权妄图通过对广大华侨进行残暴的法西斯迫害，来转移印尼革命人民对它的反动统治的强烈不满。但是，这是绝对办不到的。那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。印尼法西斯军人政权对西加里曼丹广大华侨的残酷迫害，必将激起印尼人民和华侨对这个反动政权的更剧烈的反抗，从而使它加速走向灭亡。
