De Gaulle Seizes on Pound's Devaluation and Dollar's Instability to Attack the U.S.
Emphasizes the Need to End the Dollar's Privileged Status in Capitalist Currencies
Rejects Britain's Entry into the EEC Under Current Conditions

New China News Agency, Paris, November 28th — Just as the pound devalued and the dollar's position became shaky, French President Charles de Gaulle held a press conference on the 27th, launching another attack on the United States. He reaffirmed his opposition to the dollar and pound's privileged status in the capitalist world's currency system and firmly rejected Britain's entry into the European Economic Community (EEC) under current conditions.

At the press conference, De Gaulle strongly criticized the United States for using the dollar's special status over the years to invest heavily in Europe and export dollars to offset its massive international trade deficits, shifting economic difficulties onto others. He said, "We now face the situation where the United States controls some of our enterprises... This is due to the United States exporting dollars to other countries in an inflationary manner. Notably, the U.S. international trade deficit over the past eight years is exactly the figure of U.S. investments in various European countries." He said that this U.S. practice harms France's interests.

Under the current capitalist currency system, the dollar and pound are directly linked to gold and serve as reserve currencies for capitalist countries. This allows the United States to use dollars instead of gold to offset its trade deficits, causing dollar over-supply and inflation in the capitalist world, which has sparked strong opposition from many countries, especially France.

De Gaulle reiterated in his speech the need to end the dollar and pound's privileged status in the capitalist currency system and restore the gold standard. He warned that if the United States continues this way, the dollar will devalue like the pound.

When discussing Britain's entry into the EEC, De Gaulle firmly rejected the idea and refused to negotiate with Britain on this issue.

France has always seen the EEC as a tool to compete with the United States for control over Western Europe and fears that Britain, which closely follows the United States, joining the EEC would bring the EEC under U.S. control. De Gaulle said that Britain, whether in terms of its currency, economy, or policy, is too closely tied to the United States and does not fit with the Europe we are building. He said that if Britain wants to join the EEC, it must make drastic changes.

The other five countries of the EEC (West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg) have agreed to Britain's entry for their own interests, which has created a conflict with France. Regarding this, De Gaulle threatened, "If someone insists on letting Britain join despite these circumstances, it will lead to the (EEC's) breakup." Western media generally sees De Gaulle's remarks as a warning to these countries.

In July, De Gaulle visited Canada to counterbalance the United States and in Quebec, where many French immigrants reside, he shouted "Vive le Québec libre," which angered the pro-American Canadian government and the U.S. ruling class. At the press conference on the 27th, he again discussed the issue of French Canadians. He proposed that Quebec should become a "sovereign state," cooperate with other Canadians to "prevent U.S. invasion," and establish ties with France. This indicates that De Gaulle will continue his policy of stirring up trouble in Canada, another U.S. backyard.

### 戴高乐乘英镑贬值美元不稳向美国发动进攻  强调要结束美元在资本主义货币中特权地位  再次拒绝英国在目前情况下参加西欧“共同市场”

    戴高乐乘英镑贬值美元不稳向美国发动进攻
    强调要结束美元在资本主义货币中特权地位
    再次拒绝英国在目前情况下参加西欧“共同市场”
    新华社巴黎二十八日电　正当英镑贬值，美元地位风雨飘摇的时候，法国总统戴高乐二十七日举行记者招待会，再一次向美国发动进攻，重申反对美元和英镑在资本主义世界货币制度中的特权地位，同时断然表示反对让英国在目前情况下加入西欧“共同市场”。
    戴高乐在记者招待会上强烈指责美国多年来利用美元的特殊地位，向西欧大量投资和输出美元，以抵销美国的巨大国际收支赤字，把经济困难转嫁于人。他说：“我们现在面临美国控制我们的某些企业……这是由于美国以通货膨胀的方式向其他国家输出美元，值得注意的是，美国八年来的国际收支赤字，正好是美国在西欧各国的投资的数字。”他说，美国这种做法损害了法国的利益。
    根据现行的资本主义货币制度，美元和英镑同黄金直接挂钩，并和黄金一样成为资本主义各国的储备手段，这样，美国就可以凭借美元的这种特权地位，用美元而不是用黄金来抵偿它的国际收支赤字，因而在资本主义世界造成美元过剩，通货膨胀，引起许多国家特别是法国的强烈反对。
    戴高乐在这次讲话中再次强调要结束美元和英镑在资本主义货币中的这种特权地位，恢复“黄金本位制”。他警告说，美国如果继续那样干下去，美元就要象英镑一样贬值。
    戴高乐在谈到英国加入“共同市场”问题时，断然表示拒绝英国加入，并且拒绝同英国就英国加入问题举行谈判。
    法国一向把“共同市场”集团作为它同美国争霸西欧的工具，而且担心紧紧追随美国的英国加入这个集团，将使这个集团间接受到美国的控制。戴高乐说，英国“无论根据它的货币、经济还是它的政策来说”，都同美国关系太深，“不符合我们正在建立的欧洲”。他说，如果英国要加入“共同市场”，就“必须作出急剧的改变”。
    西欧“共同市场”其他五个国家（西德、意大利、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡）出于本身利益考虑，先后同意了英国加入，这就同法国发生了矛盾。针对这一点，戴高乐威胁说：“如果有人不顾上述种种情况，硬要让英国加入，这将是 （共同市场集团的）破裂。”西方报刊普遍认为戴高乐这一段话是对这些国家的一个警告。
    戴高乐今年七月访问加拿大时为了同美国抗衡，在法国移民聚居的魁北克省曾高呼“自由魁北克万岁”，引起了亲美的加拿大政府和美国统治集团的恼火。在二十七日的记者招待会上，他又大谈法裔加拿大人问题。他提出魁北克应成为“主权国家”，同其他加拿大人合作“防止美国入侵”，并且同法国建立联系。这表明戴高乐要继续推行在美国另一后院加拿大煽风点火的政策。
