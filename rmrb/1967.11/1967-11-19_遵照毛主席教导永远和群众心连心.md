	Following Chairman Mao's instructions to always be close to the people, the leadership of the Guangzhou Military Region has been earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest directives. They have decided to accelerate their ideological transformation through self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, to maintain close ties with the masses, to improve relations between cadres and the masses, and to pass down the Party's fine traditions for generations to come.

	The People's Daily reports: The Guangzhou Military Region Party Committee recently held an expanded meeting in the form of a study class on Mao Zedong Thought. The cadres attending the meeting, with boundless love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to our great leader, took "self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism" as their guiding principle. They accelerated their ideological transformation, maintained close ties with the masses, and improved relations between superiors and subordinates.

	Earnestly studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, correctly handling relations between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses

	The comrades attending the meeting, in connection with their own practices in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, discussed the practical and far-reaching significance of the issue of relations between superiors and subordinates raised by our great leader Chairman Mao. They said that in the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao, on the one hand, proposed to educate the masses to correctly treat cadres, and on the other hand, proposed to educate cadres to correctly treat subordinates and the masses. Our great leader's guidance of great strategic significance, not only has great significance for achieving the "three-in-one combination," consolidating the great alliance of revolution, doing a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in each unit, and achieving a thorough victory in the cultural revolution, but also relates to the major issue of how to pass down the fine traditions of our Party and our army and train millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. They said that the fine tradition and style of unity between superiors and subordinates and between officers and soldiers need to be carried forward by us, and the successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution need to be trained by us. If this issue is not raised and solved now, in the future, our cadres, including old cadres, may still deviate from the masses and make serious mistakes. In the course of study, everyone deeply felt the greatness and wisdom of Chairman Mao. Just when everyone's awareness of their own shortcomings and mistakes was insufficient, Chairman Mao pointed out the direction, dug out the root of the problem, and provided ideological weapons. This is the greatest concern, the deepest education, and the strongest motivation for the whole Party and the whole army, especially for leading cadres. Comrades said that we must always remember Chairman Mao's latest directives, resolutely overcome shortcomings and mistakes, correct our attitude towards the masses, and redouble our efforts to connect with the masses and actively improve relations between superiors and subordinates. Only in this way can we ensure that our country remains unchanged for thousands of generations and maintain our revolutionary integrity.

	Correctly handling relations between superiors and subordinates is an important part of cadres' ideological transformation

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people and is thoroughly for the people's interests. It works for the people's interests." "Standing firmly with the Chinese people and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people is the sole purpose of this army." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone proposed that to always be close to the masses and further improve relations between superiors and subordinates, we must: First, take the issue of relations between superiors and subordinates as an important part of self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism by leading cadres at all levels to accelerate ideological transformation. We must frequently and repeatedly study the "Old Five Articles," criticize and eliminate bureaucratic tendencies, deeply touch the soul, thoroughly reform our worldview, and fundamentally solve the problem of our attitude towards the masses. Second, take Chairman Mao's great practice as an example, put down our airs, go deep among the masses, work, study, and criticize and reform ourselves together with the masses. Third, further improve democratic life. Every year, through institutional rectification and the initial and final evaluations of the "Four Good" campaign, we should widely promote democracy and mobilize the masses to "burn" the leadership to eliminate bourgeois tendencies. Fourth, continuously raise the class consciousness and line consciousness of the masses, guide and support the masses to resist wrong things, so that leading cadres are always supervised by the masses. Fifth, on the basis of self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, resolutely and thoroughly reform unreasonable old systems and establish reasonable new systems.

	Everyone deeply realized from long-term revolutionary practice that the relationship between officers and soldiers and between superiors and subordinates in our army is a relationship of class brothers. If relations between superiors and subordinates are not handled well, it is not just a problem of work methods or style of thinking, but a fundamental problem of stance and attitude, a problem of a revolutionary's worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Many people think that the relationship between officers and soldiers and between the army and the people is not good because of wrong methods. I always tell them that it is a problem of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose)." Everyone said that leading cadres must understand that ideological transformation is endless, that we must carry the world revolution to the end, and first of all, we must carry our own ideological revolution to the end. At present, we must especially criticize and reform our worldview in the course of self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, overcome bureaucratic tendencies and privileged thinking, and strengthen the mass point of view and the soldier-loving point of view. Many comrades took Chairman Mao's latest directives as weapons, connected with their thoughts, and checked the problems that currently exist in the issue of relations between superiors and subordinates. Everyone thought that to handle relations between superiors and subordinates well, the fundamental problem is to correctly handle the relationship between the individual and the masses. First of all, we must wholeheartedly serve the people, not have the masses serve us, and regard the masses as the masters of history, not regard ourselves as "savior." If this relationship is reversed, in handling relations between superiors and subordinates, we will inevitably emphasize our own "authority" and "privilege," making "self" and "power" run wild. In this way, in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, it is easy to take the wrong side and go the wrong way. Especially in this cultural revolution that touches people's souls, it is easy to fall for the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and take the wrong path of suppressing the masses and the revolution.

	Putting down airs and blending in with the masses

	Through self-criticism and the criticism of revisionism, the comrades attending the meeting understood that if relations between superiors and subordinates are not handled well, the main responsibility lies with the leadership. An important way to improve relations between superiors and subordinates is to go deep among the masses and blend in with them heart to heart. Our great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary style of deeply investigating and researching by going deep among the masses and getting close to them is our most brilliant example. One comrade said: "Chairman Mao, in the most tense situation, inspected the areas where the struggle was the most acute, the most intense, and the most complex, widely contacted the masses, and conducted deep investigations and research, commanding the battle on the front line. This fully embodies the greatness of our great leader, the greatest proletarian revolutionary." Another comrade said: "Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice is enough for us to learn for a lifetime and use for a lifetime. With such a great leader's wise leadership, the cultural revolution will definitely achieve a thorough victory!" Another comrade said: "Chairman Mao's line has always been from the masses to the masses. Last year, Chairman Mao received more than 1.1 million Red Guards eight times, and this year he inspected the cultural revolution situation in three regions and seven provinces and cities. Chairman Mao always trusts the masses and is always close to the people. But our airs are not small, our bodies are not close to the masses, and our hearts are not close to them. How can we deeply understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and not make mistakes!" Everyone resolutely declared: We must follow Chairman Mao's great instructions, fiercely criticize "self," eliminate bureaucratic tendencies, and truly go among the masses to cure the disease of deviating from the masses. A leader of a certain academy was criticized during the cultural revolution and had a sense of grievance. After studying and discussing, he said with tears of excitement: "Father and mother are not as close as Chairman Mao! I will definitely follow Chairman Mao's instructions to criticize and reform myself, overcome the sense of opposition to the masses, and voluntarily and enthusiastically admit, criticize, and correct mistakes, and build new merits for the people."

	The more they discussed, the deeper their understanding became, and the more urgent the need to implement Chairman Mao's latest directives. They studied, implemented, and put into practice at the same time. The Party Committee of a certain unit first concentrated on studying at home, earnestly carried out self-criticism, and then went to the troops in turn to lecture and listen to the masses' opinions to improve relations between superiors and subordinates. Some leading cadres immediately found subordinates to have heart-to-heart talks, "look in the mirror and wash their faces." Some leading cadres took their backpacks to the companies and blended in with the revolutionary masses, exposing their thoughts and criticizing their hearts together with the broad masses of soldiers and revolutionary masses, and together criticizing the counter-revolutionary crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

    遵照毛主席教导永远和群众心连心
    广州部队领导干部认真学习毛主席最新指示，决心在斗私批修中加速思想革命化，密切联系群众，搞好干群关系，把党的优良传统千秋万代地传下去
    本报讯　广州部队党委最近用党委扩大会的形式作为毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，到会的干部怀着对我们伟大领袖无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的革命激情，以“斗私，批修”为纲，加速思想革命化，密切联系群众，搞好上下级关系。
    认真学习毛主席最新指示，正确处理上下级关系和干群关系
    到会同志结合自己在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中的实践，畅谈了我们伟大领袖毛主席提出上下级关系问题的现实意义和深远意义。大家说，在无产阶级文化大革命的新形势下，毛主席一方面提出要教育群众正确对待干部，另一方面又提出要教育干部正确对待下级，正确对待群众。我们伟大领袖这一具有伟大战略意义的教导，不仅对于实现革命“三结合”，巩固革命大联合，搞好本单位的斗、批、改，夺取文化大革命的彻底胜利具有重大意义，而且关系到如何把我党我军优良传统继承下来，造就千百万无产阶级革命事业接班人的重大问题。大家说，上下一致，官兵一致的好传统、好作风需要我们去带，无产阶级革命事业接班人需要我们去培养，这个问题如果现在不提出、不解决，将来我们的干部，包括老干部在内，还可能会脱离群众，犯极大的错误。在学习中，大家深深感受到毛主席的伟大英明。正当大家对自己的缺点、错误认识不足的时候，毛主席给指明了方向，挖出了病根，送来了思想武器，这是对全党全军，特别是对领导干部最大的关怀，最深刻的教育，最有力的鞭策。同志们说，我们一定要牢记毛主席的最新指示，坚决克服缺点、错误，端正对群众的态度，加倍努力联系群众，积极搞好上下级关系，只有这样，才能保证我们国家千秋万代永不变色，才能保持自己的革命晚节。
    正确处理上下级关系，是干部搞好思想革命化的重要内容
    毛主席教导我们：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”“紧紧地和中国人民站在一起，全心全意地为中国人民服务，就是这个军队的唯一的宗旨。”根据毛主席的教导，大家提出，要做到时刻不脱离群众，进一步搞好上下级关系，必须：一，要把上下级关系问题作为各级领导同志斗私批修，搞好思想革命化的重要内容。要经常地、反复地学习“老五篇”，斗掉“官”气，狠触灵魂，彻底改造世界观，从根本上解决对待群众的态度问题。二，以毛主席的伟大实践为榜样，放下架子，深入群众，和群众一起劳动，一起学习，一起斗私批修。三，进一步健全民主生活。每年都要通过机关整风和四好初评、总评，广泛发扬民主，发动群众“烧一烧”领导，把资产阶级的“官”气打掉。四，不断提高群众的阶级觉悟和路线觉悟，引导和支持群众抵制错误的东西，使领导干部时刻得到群众的监督。五，在斗私批修的基础上，坚决彻底改革不合理的旧制度，建立合理的新制度。
    大家从长期革命实践中深刻地认识到：我军官兵之间、上下级之间都是阶级兄弟的关系。上下级关系搞不好，不是一般的工作方法问题，也不是一般的思想作风问题，而是一个根本立场、根本态度问题，是一个革命者的世界观问题。毛主席教导我们：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题”。大家说，领导干部必须懂得思想改造无止境，要把世界革命进行到底，首先要把自我思想革命进行到底。当前特别要在斗私批修中认真改造自己的世界观，克服官僚主义作风和特权思想，增强群众观点和爱兵观点。许多同志都以毛主席最新指示为武器，联系思想，检查了当前在上下级关系问题方面存在的问题。大家认为，要搞好上下级关系，根本的问题是一定要把个人和群众的关系摆正，首先自己要全心全意为人民服务，而不是要群众为自己服务，要把群众看作是历史的主人，而不是把自己看成是“救世主”。如果颠倒了这个关系，在处理上下级关系上，就必然强调自己的“权威”和“特权”，使“私”字和“权”字作怪。这样，就会在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中，容易站错队，走错路。特别是在这场触及人们灵魂的文化大革命中，容易上资产阶级反动路线的当，走上压制群众、压制革命的错误道路。
    放下架子，和群众打成一片
    通过斗私批修，使到会同志懂得了上下级关系搞不好，主要责任在领导。密切上下级关系的重要途径，是深入到群众中去和群众贴心贴肉，甘当群众的小学生。我们伟大领袖毛主席深入实际，接近群众，进行深入调查研究的革命作风，是我们最最光辉的榜样。有的同志说：“毛主席他老人家，在形势最紧张的时候，视察斗争最尖锐、最激烈、最复杂的地区，广泛接触群众，深入调查研究，在火线上指挥战斗。这充分体现了我们伟大领袖最伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄。”有的同志说：“毛主席的伟大革命实践够我们学一辈子，用一辈子，我们有这样伟大领袖的英明领导，文化大革命一定能够取得彻底胜利！”有的同志说：“毛主席的路线从来就是从群众中来到群众中去的。去年，毛主席八次接见了一千一百多万红卫兵，今年又视察了三个地区七个省市的文化大革命情况，毛主席他老人家是最相信群众，永远和群众心连心。而我们的架子不小，和群众身子靠得不近，心贴得不紧，怎能深刻领会毛主席革命路线，又怎能不犯错误呢！”大家坚决表示：一定要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，狠斗“私”字，打掉官气，真正到群众中去治脱离群众的病。有一位院校的领导同志在文化大革命中受到批判，有委屈情绪，经过学习讨论，他含着热泪激动地说：“爹亲娘亲没有毛主席亲！我一定遵照毛主席的指示，要斗私，批修，克服和群众的对立情绪，坚决自觉地痛痛快快地承认错误，检讨错误，改正错误，为人民立新功，建新劳。”
    大家越讨论，认识越深刻，贯彻执行毛主席最新指示的要求越迫切。他们边学习、边贯彻、边落实。某部党委先集中在家学习，认真开展自我批评，然后分头到部队巡回讲用，听取群众意见，改进上下级关系。有的领导干部立即找下面干部谈心，“照镜子洗脸”。还有的领导干部背起背包到连队和革命群众中去，和广大战士、革命群众一起亮思想斗私心，一起批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命罪行。
