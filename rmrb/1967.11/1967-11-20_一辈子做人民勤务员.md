All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Our cadres, whether old or new, must be servants of the people and students of the masses. Whether we place ourselves in the position of students of the masses and servants of the people, or in the position of officials, is a stern test for every revolutionary cadre.

Whether we are willing and able to be students of the masses and servants of the people ultimately depends on our worldview, on whether we prioritize the collective or the individual. The influence of the old ideas, consciousness, and habits of the exploiting classes over thousands of years is deep and still affects many people's minds. If we do not resolutely struggle against it, it will corrupt our souls and drag us into the stinking mire of the bourgeoisie. This not only concerns whether cadres will change or not, but also whether the proletarian dictatorship can be consolidated. The handful of capitalist roaders within the party exposed during this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution serve as a warning. We should learn from this valuable lesson. Therefore, we must take "fighting the self and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, study Chairman Mao's works actively and practically, consciously revolutionize ourselves, thoroughly criticize the "self" and establish the "public," and strive to change our worldview. We must learn until old age, change until old age, follow until old age. We must forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, forever loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, seriously and conscientiously implement the mass line, humbly be students of the masses, and honestly be servants of the people, and continuously make new contributions for the people.

### 一辈子做人民勤务员

专栏：各地报纸评论摘要

    一辈子做人民勤务员
    “我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”。我们的干部，不论是老干部，还是新干部，都要做人民的勤务员，做群众的小学生。把自己放在群众的小学生、勤务员的位置，还是放在官老爷的位置，对我们每个革命干部说来，是一个严峻的考验。
    愿不愿意、能不能够做群众的小学生、人民的勤务员，归根到底是一个世界观的问题，是“公”字当头，还是“私”字当头的问题。几千年来，剥削阶级的旧思想旧意识旧习惯影响很深，至今还在许多人的头脑里起作用。如果不同它作坚决的斗争，就会腐蚀人们的灵魂，把我们拉进资产阶级腐臭的泥坑。这不仅关系到干部变不变质的问题，而且关系到无产阶级政权能不能巩固的大问题。这次无产阶级文化大革命中揪出来的党内一小撮走资派，就是前车之鉴，我们应当从这里吸取有益的教训。因此，我们必须以“斗私，批修”为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，自觉革命，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，狠狠改造世界观，要做到老，学到老，改到老，跟到老。永远忠于毛主席，永远忠于毛泽东思想，永远忠于毛主席的革命路线，认真坚持实行群众路线，恭恭敬敬地当群众的小学生，老老实实地做人民的勤务员，不断地为人民立新功。
