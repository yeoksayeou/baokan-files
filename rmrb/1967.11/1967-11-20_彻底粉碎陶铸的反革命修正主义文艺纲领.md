Edition: 4

Tao Zhu, this old opportunist, while occupying the leading positions in Guangdong and the Central South region for over a decade, has followed the instructions of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, colluded with the ghosts and snakes in the literary world, and launched one savage attack after another against the Party. Especially during the period from 1962 to 1965, when class struggle was extremely sharp and intense, Tao Zhu closely followed China's Khrushchev, engaged in surrender and betrayal in the Central South region, formed cliques, and wielded the knife to slaughter revolutionary literature. He used every means to let poisonous weeds grow, creating public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. We must cut off Tao Zhu's black hands in the literary world, thoroughly expose and criticize all his reactionary words and deeds in the literary world, and overthrow and denounce him!

Bare-chested, frenziedly executing the counterrevolutionary literary program

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: The enemy's estimate of the situation is always wrong. "Their class instinct leads them to always think that they are so great, while the revolutionary forces are no good. They always overestimate their own strength and underestimate our strength."

In 1961, internationally, the Soviet revisionists held their "22nd Congress," forming a complete system of the revisionist line; they announced the "people's state," the "people's party," and implemented the restoration of capitalism, with the bourgeois dictatorship replacing the dictatorship of the proletariat. The "Three Nos and One Iron" reached a dirty political deal, jointly opened a black market company for anti-China, anti-Communist, and anti-people activities, and launched a hysterical counterrevolutionary sales campaign. China's Khrushchev misjudged the situation, thinking this was the "heaven-sent opportunity" to usurp the proletarian dictatorship, and thus rallied the ghosts and snakes in the literary world to throw out a thorough counterrevolutionary revisionist literary program, frenziedly advocating bourgeois liberalization. For a time, the demonic fog was thick, and it was extremely arrogant. In March 1962, the counterrevolutionary revisionist elements led by Tian Han and others went south to Guangzhou and held the National Drama and Opera Creation Conference.

This big black meeting was an important part of the counterrevolutionary restoration plot carefully planned by China's Khrushchev and his accomplices. The purpose of the meeting was to completely negate Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line and to fully promote the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary program. Tao Zhu, in the roles of "host," "audience," and "party worker," joined this anti-Party, anti-socialist, anti-Mao Zedong Thought grand chorus. At the meeting, he spoke recklessly, attacking the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, attacking Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line, and vigorously promoting the counterrevolutionary revisionist literary black line.

Look at him, sometimes he would scream and shout, cursing the Party's leadership as a "despotic kingdom," "arrogant and overbearing," "not respecting the writer's ownership," "subjective and blind command," and "torturing" writers, saying that writers could not write "good works" because the Party "interfered arbitrarily." Sometimes, under the pretext of "promoting creation," he would shout for a "thaw," wanting to create a bourgeois liberalized situation of "various flowers blooming and birds singing." The head of the literary world's counterrevolutionary revisionists, Zhou Yang, once shouted in a speech: "Although it has thawed now, dogmatism and sectarianism are still very serious, and it is still in the 'spring chill' state. The truly warm and blooming period has not yet come." Tao Zhu also said in this speech: "I think there seems to be a bit of killing atmosphere," "at least it is not yet a warm spring, but rather the early spring weather, when it is slightly warm and still cold," "I hope that the autumn wind will not blow again, and that there will be more warm spring breezes! Once the autumn wind blows, the leaves will fall, and where will there be a hundred flowers blooming?" Look, from the big rightist Fei Xiaotong, who advocated the early spring weather, to Zhou Yang, to Tao Zhu, their thoughts are so consistent, and their language is so similar, just as Tao Zhu said, "People have the same heart, and hearts have the same reason." Their "heart" and "reason" are to open up a counterrevolutionary revisionist literary road in China!

Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The Communist Party of China is the core of leadership for all the people of China. Without such a core, the cause of socialism cannot be victorious." Tao Zhu regarded the Party's leadership as a "thorn in the eye" and a "thorn in the flesh," attempting to abolish the Party's leadership over literature and fiercely opposing the use of Mao Zedong Thought to guide literature. This is truly the heart of a wolf and tiger, extremely malicious!

At this meeting, Tao Zhu blatantly distorted Chairman Mao's direction of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. He called the political guidance of literature and literature serving politics "formulaic" and "conceptual." He loudly advocated changing this situation, saying, "We cannot understand serving politics too narrowly;" "the themes of the works should be broader," writing anything at random, "as long as the works have progressive elements and some educational significance, it is fine." Poisonous weeds like "The Case of the Ax," "Exploring the Dark Mountain," and "Hai Rui Carries the Boat" that praise feudal officials can all be written and performed. He vigorously advocated that writers should dare to write about the "dark side," "go into life," and "see the bad side," because "only in this way can one see the whole picture and understand life deeply." He even openly incited writers not to be afraid of touching the "three, six, nine" ("three" refers to the general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes, "six" refers to the six political standards for distinguishing between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, and "nine" refers to the relationship between nine fingers and one finger), and that writing works against the "three, six, nine" would not be considered rightist if rightist, or anti-Party if anti-Party. Otherwise, it would be "disrespectful," "untrustworthy," "undemocratic," and "unfree" to the writers. The reactionary arguments that Tao Zhu vigorously advocated here fully exposed his sinister intentions, which is to clear the way for the free spread of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, and to cheer and support a small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists to brazenly engage in activities to restore capitalism.

Tao Zhu's speech at this meeting is a thorough counterrevolutionary restoration manifesto, fully exposing his collusion with a group of ghosts and snakes in the literary world, taking advantage of the situation to stir up trouble, and attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism.

Surrender and betrayal, form cliques, and create a great proliferation of reactionary literature

To promote his counterrevolutionary revisionist literary program, Tao Zhu extensively engaged in surrender and betrayal, personally removing the hats of bourgeois intellectuals from a group of bourgeois reactionary "experts" and "authorities," and praising them as "revolutionaries tested by time." He often held "consultation meetings," allowing them to "vent their grievances" and "release their private resentments," and extensively engaged in "spiritual compensation." For what are called "national treasures" and "authorities," Tao Zhu respected them like parents and treated them like siblings, not only promoting them in rank and position but also frequently inviting them to scenic areas for "god-like vacations," allowing them to chew dog meat, drink tea, take big naps during the day, play mahjong, dance to Western music, and indulge in wine and women at night, in order to let this group of walking corpses of the bourgeoisie regain their spirits and create various anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought poisonous weeds to destroy the revolution and poison the people!

For the poisonous weeds thrown out by reactionary "literati" and "poets," Tao Zhu used his authority to extensively praise them, open the green light, and let them all pass. On the stage of art, feudal landlords, the bourgeoisie, and revisionist figures were beautified into "heroes," while the proletariat and laboring people were instead vilified and ridiculed, forming a great reversal of light and darkness. The film industry successively threw out "Inviting" the rightist opportunists who were dismissed from office to return to power and lead the charge in "The King of Qi Seeks Generals," praising the captured Nationalist generals' "bravery" in "Thousands of Miles Against the Wind," and advocating Hai Rui's "rebellious character" in "Liu Mingzhu." The drama industry performed emperors and generals, talented scholars and beauties, rich peasants, counterrevolutionaries, and evil spirits, ghosts, and snakes. Tao Zhu watched these dramas full of poison and was delighted, praising them endlessly, saying that "Hai Rui Carries the Boat" is a very good historical drama, "Wen Tianxiang" has an inspiring effect, "Li Xiangjun" I also agree with, and "Recruiting Soldiers" is a revolutionary modern drama that can be performed in the countryside. After Comrade Chen Boda wrote "On the Autobiography of Loyal King Li Xiucheng" and was fiercely attacked by the Zhou Yang group, Tao Zhu actually said that the poisonous weed "Li Xiucheng" is well-written, inciting writers in the Central South region to attack the proletarian revolutionaries. In the literary world, poisonous weeds such as "Three Families Lane," "Struggle," "Gems from the Sea of Art," "Pearl River Spring and Autumn," and "Flower City" successively emerged, and Tao Zhu extensively affirmed them, saying they are all "good socialist works" and "welcomed by peasants." In the music world, the "Guangzhou Music Flower Festival" was extensively promoted, and the "traditional heritage" of Guangdong music was extensively dug up. Thus, low-level yellow and decadent music flooded the music world.

Despite this, Tao Zhu was still not satisfied. He generously spent national funds to rebuild Hai Rui's tomb in Hainan, renovate the "Five Gentlemen Temple," and even for the concubine of Su Dongpo buried in Huizhou, he did not hesitate to spend tens of thousands of yuan to renovate her tomb. What is particularly infuriating is that he also stole more than 70,000 foreign exchange and a batch of gold materials from the state to import from Shanghai, specially hiring art professionals to carefully select and publish "Selected Famous Paintings of Guangdong," even including the works of traitors and other reactionaries. Tao Zhu shamelessly said, "I did a good deed."

To use the rotting bones of the dead to summon the rightist opportunists and encourage the anti-Party and anti-socialist elements, Tao Zhu also repeatedly praised Bao Zheng for his ability to "investigate and study," "seek justice for the people," and "dare to defy authority"; he advocated that the spirit of Hai Rui is worth every Communist Party member to learn. One dog barks, and a hundred dogs follow. A small handful of counterrevolutionary revisionists in the Central South region, like flies following the smell, swarmed around the rotting bones of their reactionary ancestors, writing poems and paintings, researching and verifying, standing on the graves of their reactionary ancestors, and howling and cursing at the proletariat!

The proliferation of poisonous weeds in the literary world of the Central South region is a great crime of Tao Zhu's anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities, and a great exposure of his evil ambition to usurp the proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism!

Makeup and stagecraft, two-faced, strangle the new revolutionary modern drama

In 1964, China's Khrushchev, in order to further seize the literary and art field and create counterrevolutionary public opinion, instructed the counterrevolutionary revisionist leaders in the literary and art world, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Qi Yanming, Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Shao Yulin, to hold black meetings multiple times, play tricks, and plot poisonous schemes to launch a savage attack on the Party and socialism. The generals under China's Khrushchev, Tao Zhu, vied for merit and service, unwilling to be left behind, and opened the floodgates for feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, allowing "wise rulers and loyal ministers," "righteous masters and loyal slaves," lovers, ghosts, and gods to rule the urban and rural stages, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship in the literary and art world.

At the critical juncture of class struggle, our great leader Chairman Mao made a wise directive: "These associations and the publications they control (it is said that there are a few good ones) have, for the most part (not everyone) over the past fifteen years, basically (not everything) not implemented the Party's policies, acted as officials and lords, did not approach the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and did not reflect the socialist revolution and construction. In recent years, they have even fallen to the brink of revisionism. If they are not seriously reformed, they will inevitably become organizations like the Petofi Club in Hungary on some future day." Chairman Mao's great directive gave the counterrevolutionary revisionist group a heavy blow and a fatal strike, greatly suppressing the arrogance of the bourgeoisie and greatly boosting the morale of the proletariat. At this time, Comrade Jiang Qing, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, led the proletarian revolutionary faction in the literary and art world, braved the thorns and thistles, overcame countless difficulties, and created the brilliant model of proletarian revolutionary literature, making China's Khrushchev and his henchmen even more frightened and anxious.

Tao Zhu felt that the situation was not good, and he changed his stance, went with the flow, and quickly took out his cunning skills as a counterrevolutionary two-faced person, stretching out his black hands to "grasp" revolutionary modern dramas. On July 1, 1965, the "Central South Region Drama Appreciation Performance Conference" that had been planned for a long time finally started. However, no matter how much the crow tries to insert peacock feathers, it will still cry like a crow. During the entire performance period, Tao Zhu hurriedly rushed between theaters and hotels, evaluating literature and drama, making extensive remarks, and was busy beyond measure. On August 15, Tao Zhu made a summary report at the closing ceremony. In this summary report and in his remarks at the large and small meetings, he thoroughly exposed himself as a stubborn diehard who resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line and insisted on the revisionist black line.

Revolutionary modern dramas occupy the stage, which is a landmark development in socialist literature and art, and a serious political struggle. However, at this meeting, Tao Zhu deliberately put on the airs of an art connoisseur, vigorously advocating the reactionary fallacy of "art above all." On the one hand, he said a few insincere good words about revolutionary modern dramas, and on the other hand, he fiercely cursed revolutionary modern dramas for "politically occupying the stage" and lacking artistry. He loudly advocated that "Peking Opera should be named Peking, Cantonese Opera should be named Cantonese, and the characteristics of traditional operas should not be changed." He said that "attention should be paid in time to correct the current tendency of only paying attention to political content and neglecting artistic form that has already appeared, and prevent and overcome the tendency of neglecting art." He slandered that "political standards first" is to treat "first as the only," saying that this can only produce "slogan-like clumsy works." He also threatened in a shocking way that "neglecting art, with low quality, no one wants to watch," it would "possibly lead to a relapse." Tao Zhu talked about "art" when he opened his mouth and closed his mouth, not because he was "bewitched by art." "The true intention is not in the wine," Tao Zhu's intention is still in politics. Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In any class society, any class always places political standards first and artistic standards second." Tao Zhu peddled the fallacy of "art above all" across classes, intending to lead revolutionary modern dramas into the revisionist "artistic labyrinth," turning them into a sinister tool for China's Khrushchev and his gang to usurp the proletarian dictatorship.

What is "neglecting art" and "possibly leading to a relapse"? This is Tao Zhu's trick. On the surface, he pretended to be afraid of "relapse," but in fact, "relapse" is what he has been longing for. The wolf in sheep's clothing, the tail has nowhere to hide. In his words, he has already revealed the "heavenly secret." Tao Zhu said: "After a period of time, ... traditional operas should still be performed a little." "Starting from next July, it can gradually be opened. Traditional operas can occupy at most twenty percent of the total number of performances and scenes." Tao Zhu's speech this time was titled "Revolutionary Modern Dramas Should Rapidly and Completely Occupy the Stage." Since it is to "rapidly and completely occupy ...," why let "traditional dramas" gradually open? This fully exposed his reactionary face of attempting to strangle revolutionary modern dramas. Tao Zhu, fearing that "traditional dramas" could not "rapidly and completely occupy the stage," played another trick of high-price bribery, proposing to use 50 million yuan to "buy down the stage" of emperors and generals, talented scholars and beauties, and that "county-level and above regional drama troupes that cannot write or perform revolutionary modern dramas" should all be taken over by the state. This cunning Tao Zhu actually adopted the tactic of "revolutionizing in name but preserving in reality," intending to temporarily avoid the wind, preserve his strength, prepare for a comeback, and achieve the great "relapse" of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionist drama that he needed.

The counterrevolutionary two-faced Tao Zhu closely followed China's Khrushchev, sometimes bare-chested and sometimes in makeup, attempting to use literature and art, this important weapon, to create public opinion for their restoration of capitalism. Chairman Mao teaches us: The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of state power. The dictatorship of the proletariat is the lifeline of the working people. If the enemy wants to move the proletarian dictatorship even a little bit, we must fight to the death with it! "Rouse hundreds of millions of workers and peasants, unite and fight!" We must perform revolutionary modern dramas and sing revolutionary songs to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must firmly hold high the great banner of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary literary line, making literature and art forever a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, striking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy.

    彻底粉碎陶铸的反革命修正主义文艺纲领
    广州部队批陶小组
    陶铸这个老牌机会主义者，在窃据广东和中南地区领导职务的十余年中，秉承党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，伙同文艺界的牛鬼蛇神，向党发动了一次又一次猖狂进攻。特别是一九六二年至一九六五年阶级斗争十分尖锐、激烈的期间，陶铸紧紧追随中国赫鲁晓夫，在中南地区招降纳叛，结党营私，大挥刀斧砍杀革命文艺，千方百计地放毒草出笼，为复辟资本主义大造舆论。我们一定要斩断陶铸伸向文艺界的黑手，把他在文艺界的一切反动言行揭深、揭透，批倒、批臭！
    赤膊上阵，疯狂执行反革命文艺纲领
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：阶级敌人对形势的估计总是错误的。“他们的阶级本能引导他们老是在想：他们自己怎样了不起，而革命势力总是不行的。他们总是高估了自己的力量，低估了我们的力量。”
    一九六一年，国际上，苏修召开了“二十二大”，形成了修正主义路线的完整体系；宣布“全民国家”、“全民党”，实行资本主义复辟，资产阶级专政代替了无产阶级专政。“三尼一铁”达成肮脏的政治交易，合伙开设反华、反共、反人民的黑货公司，掀起了歇斯底里的反革命大叫卖。中国赫鲁晓夫错误地估计了形势，以为这正是篡夺无产阶级政权的“天赐良机”，于是纠集文艺界的牛鬼蛇神，抛出了彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义文艺纲领，疯狂鼓吹资产阶级自由化，一时妖雾腾腾，真是嚣张透顶。一九六二年三月，反革命修正主义分子田汉等一伙，南下广州，召开了全国话剧歌剧创作会议。
    这个大黑会，是中国赫鲁晓夫及其帮凶精心策划的反革命复辟阴谋的一个重要组成部分。会议的目的，是全盘否定毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，全面推行反革命修正主义文艺纲领。陶铸以“主人”、“观众”、“党务工作者”三重身份，加入了这次反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大合唱。在会上，他大放厥词，攻击伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，攻击毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，极力推行反革命修正主义的文艺黑线。
    你看他，一会儿撒泼放赖地大骂党的领导是“专制王国”，“飞扬跋扈”，“不尊重作家所有权”，“主观主义瞎指挥”，对作家进行了“虐待”，作家之所以写不出“好作品”是由于党“横加干涉”；一会儿以所谓“繁荣创作”为名，狂叫“解冻”，要搞出一个“杂花生树，群莺乱飞”的资产阶级自由化的局面来。文艺界反革命修正主义头目周扬在一次讲话中曾经叫嚷：“现在虽然已经解冻，但教条主义和宗派主义还很厉害，目前还处于‘春寒’状态，真正春暖花开的时期还没有到来。”陶铸在这次讲话中也说：“我看似乎有点肃杀之气”，“至少现在还不是温暖的春天，还不过是早春的天气，乍暖还寒的时候”，“我希望，不要再刮秋风了，多一点温暖的春风吧！秋风一来，树叶尽脱，还有什么百花齐放呢？”看，从鼓吹早春天气的大右派费孝通，到周扬，到陶铸，思想如此一致，语言也如此相似，正是陶铸所说的“人同此心，心同此理”。他们的“心”和“理”，就是要在中国开辟一条反革命修正主义的文艺道路！
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”陶铸把党的领导视为“眼中钉”“肉中刺”，妄图取消党对文艺的领导，疯狂反对用毛泽东思想统帅文艺，真是虎狼之心，恶毒已极！
    在这次会上，陶铸公然篡改毛主席的文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的方向。他把政治统帅文艺，文艺服务于政治，称之为“公式化”“概念化”。他大声疾呼，要“改变这种状况”，“不能对为政治服务理解得太狭窄”；“作品的题材要广泛一些”，随便写什么，“只要作品有进步因素，多少有点教育意义就行。”象《铡美案》、《探阴山》、《海瑞背纤》等歌颂封建社会的所谓“清官”的大毒草，也“都可以写，可以演”。他大肆鼓吹作家要敢于写“阴暗面”，“到生活里去”，要“看坏的方面”，“因为只有这样才能看得全面，对生活才能理解得深。”甚至公开煽动作家不要怕碰“三、六、九”（“三”指总路线、大跃进、人民公社，“六”指识别香花毒草的六项政治标准，“九”指九个指头与一个指头的关系），写了反“三、六、九”的作品，右倾不能说右倾，反党不能说反党，否则就是对作家“不尊重”、“不信赖”、“不民主”、“不自由”。陶铸在这里拚命宣扬的这一套反动论调，充分暴露了他的险毒用心，这就是为封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的自由泛滥鸣锣开道，为一小撮反革命修正主义分子放肆地搞复辟资本主义活动助威撑腰。
    陶铸的这次讲话，是一篇彻头彻尾的反革命复辟宣言书，充分暴露了他伙同一帮文艺界牛鬼蛇神，乘机兴风作浪，妄图颠覆无产阶级专政，复辟资本主义的狼子野心。
    招降纳叛，结党营私，造成反动文艺的大泛滥
    陶铸为了推行他的反革命修正主义文艺纲领，大肆招降纳叛，亲自给一帮资产阶级反动“专家”、“权威”摘掉资产阶级知识分子的帽子，吹捧他们是“经过考验”的“老革命”。他经常召开“恳谈会”，让他们“吐怨气”、“泄私愤”，大搞“精神退赔”。对于什么“国宝”、“权威”，陶铸更是敬如父母，亲如手足，不但给他们加官进禄，而且经常请他们到风景区度“神仙假”，让他们白天嚼狗肉，品香茗，困大觉，晚上打麻将，跳洋舞，花天酒地，纸醉金迷，以便让这群资产阶级的行尸走肉养足精神，制造各种反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的大毒草，破坏革命，毒害人民！
    对于反动“文人”“骚客”抛出来的大毒草，陶铸更是利用职权，极力吹捧，大开绿灯，一律放行。艺术舞台上，封建地主、资产阶级、修正主义人物被美化为“英雄”，无产阶级、劳动人民反而被丑化，被挖苦，形成了光明黑暗的大颠倒。电影界接二连三抛出了“拜请”被罢官的右倾机会主义分子还朝挂帅的《齐王求将》、歌颂国民党被俘将领“英勇不屈”的《逆风千里》、宣扬海瑞“反抗性格”的《刘明珠》等反动影片。戏剧界则大演帝王将相，才子佳人，地富反坏，牛鬼蛇神。陶铸看了这些充满毒素的戏剧，赏心悦目，赞不绝口，说什么《海瑞背纤》“是很好的历史剧”，《文天祥》“有鼓舞作用”，《李香君》“我也赞成”，《抓壮丁》“是革命现代戏”，“可以拿到农村上演”。当戚本禹同志写了《评忠王李秀成自述》，遭受周扬一伙疯狂打击之后，陶铸竟说大毒草《李秀成》“写得好”，煽动中南地区的作家围攻无产阶级革命派。在文学界，《三家巷》、《苦斗》、《艺海拾贝》、《珠海春秋》、《花城》等大毒草相继出笼，陶铸大加肯定，说全是“社会主义的好作品”，“受农民欢迎”。在音乐界，则大兴“羊城音乐花会”，大挖广东音乐“传统遗产”，于是，低级黄色的靡靡之音，充斥了乐坛。
    尽管这样，陶铸犹嫌不足。他慷国家之慨，在海南重修海瑞墓，整饰“五公祠”，并为清末保皇党康有为、梁启超扬幡招魂；甚至连苏东坡葬在惠州的一个侍妾的坟墓也不惜耗费千元巨款重新修缮。尤其令人愤慨的是他还盗用了国家七万多元外汇和一批黄金进口物资，从上海特聘专门美术人员精心选辑出版了《广东名画选》，其中竟连汉奸等反动家伙的作品都收集了进去，陶铸居然还恬不知耻地说“办了一件好事”。
    陶铸为了利用僵尸朽骨为右倾机会主义分子招魂，为反党反社会主义分子打气，还喋喋不休地赞美包公善于“调查研究”，“替民伸冤”，“不畏权势”；鼓吹海瑞精神“值得每个共产党员学习”。一犬吠形，百犬吠声，中南地区的一小撮反革命修正主义分子，就象苍蝇逐臭一般围着僵尸腐骨滴溜乱转，写诗作画，研究考证，站在他们反动祖先的坟头上，向无产阶级狂嚎恶骂！
    中南地区文艺界毒草大泛滥，就是陶铸反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的大罪证，就是陶铸篡夺无产阶级政权，复辟资本主义罪恶野心的大暴露！
    粉墨登场，两面三刀，扼杀新生的革命现代戏
    一九六四年，中国赫鲁晓夫为了进一步夺取文艺阵地，大造反革命舆论，指使文艺界反革命修正主义头目周扬、林默涵、齐燕铭、夏衍、田汉、邵荃麟等人，多次召开黑会，耍阴谋，施毒计，向党向社会主义发动猖狂的进攻。中国的赫鲁晓夫麾下的干将陶铸，争功效力，“不甘后人”，为封建主义、资本主义、修正主义大开闸门，让“明君贤臣”、“义主忠奴”，痴男怨女、厉鬼天神统治城乡舞台，在文艺界实行资产阶级专政。
    在阶级斗争的紧要关头，我们伟大的领袖毛主席作了英明批示：“这些协会和他们所掌握的刊物的大多数（据说有少数几个好的），十五年来，基本上（不是一切人）不执行党的政策，做官当老爷，不去接近工农兵，不去反映社会主义的革命和建设。最近几年，竟然跌到了修正主义的边缘。如不认真改造，势必在将来的某一天，要变成象匈牙利裴多菲俱乐部那样的团体。”毛主席的伟大指示给反革命修正主义集团当头一棒，致命一击，大灭了资产阶级威风，大长了无产阶级志气。这时，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的江青同志，率领文艺界的无产阶级革命派，披荆斩棘，排除万难，创立了无产阶级革命文艺的光辉样板，使中国的赫鲁晓夫及其走卒们更加心惊胆颤、惶惶不安。
    陶铸感到大势不妙，他看风转舵，顺水推舟，急忙拿出反革命两面派的刁滑本领，伸出黑手，“大抓”革命现代戏。一九六五年七月一日，筹谋已久的“中南区戏剧观摩演出大会”鸣锣开场了。但是，乌鸦尽管插上孔雀的羽毛，叫起来总还是乌鸦的腔调。陶铸在整个会演期间，匆匆奔走于剧院宾馆，评文品戏，大发议论，忙得个不可开交。八月十五日，陶铸在闭幕大会上作了总结报告。他在这个总结报告和大会小会的谈吐议论中，彻底地暴露了他是一个抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线，坚持修正主义文艺黑线的死不悔悟的顽固派。
    革命现代戏占领舞台，这是社会主义文艺划时代的发展，是一场严重的政治斗争。可是，陶铸在这次会上，却故意摆开一副艺术欣赏家的架势，大肆宣扬“艺术至上”的反动谬论。他一面对革命现代戏不疼不痒地说两句好话，一面又恶狠狠地咒骂革命现代戏是在政治上“霸占舞台”，缺乏艺术性。他大声疾呼“京剧要姓京，粤剧要姓粤，不要把传统戏的特色改掉了。”说什么：“要及时注意纠正目前已经出现的某些只注意政治内容，忽视艺术形式的苗头，防止和克服忽视艺术的偏向。”污蔑“政治标准第一”是将“第一当作唯一”，说这样只能拿出“标语口号式的拙劣作品”。并耸人听闻地威胁说：“忽视了艺术，质量很低，大家不愿意看”，就“可能出现反复”。陶铸张口“艺术”，闭口“艺术”，并非是着了“艺术迷”。“醉翁之意不在酒”，陶铸之意还是在政治。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“任何阶级社会中的任何阶级，总是以政治标准放在第一位，以艺术标准放在第二位的。”陶铸贩卖超阶级“艺术至上”的谬论，无非是企图将革命现代戏引入修正主义的“艺术迷宫”，使之变成中国赫鲁晓夫一伙篡夺无产阶级政权的罪恶工具。
    什么“忽视艺术”，“可能出现反复”？这是陶铸耍的障眼法。他表面上装模作样怕“反复”，其实，“出现反复”正是他梦寐以求的事。野狼扮绵羊，尾巴无处藏。言谈话语之间，早已泄露了“天机”。陶铸说：“过一段时间，……传统戏还是要演一点的。”“明年七月以后，可以开始逐步开放。传统戏在整个演出剧目和场次中最高只能占百分之二十。”陶铸这次讲话，是以《革命现代戏要迅速地全部地占领舞台》为题的，既然是“迅速地全部地占领……”，为什么又让“传统剧目”逐步开放呢？这就充分暴露了他妄图扼杀革命现代戏的反动嘴脸。陶铸犹恐“传统剧目”“迅速地全部地占领舞台”不能落实，又玩弄高价收买的阴谋，提出用五千万元巨款将帝王将相、才子佳人“买下舞台”，将所谓“写不出，演不了”革命现代戏的“县以上专区剧团，全部由国家包下来”。这个诡计多端的陶铸，竟采取明“革”暗保的手段，企图暂时避开风头，保存实力，准备东山再起，实现他所需要的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义戏剧的大“反复”。
    反革命两面派陶铸紧紧追随中国赫鲁晓夫，时而赤膊上阵，时而粉墨登场，妄图利用文艺这个重要武器为他们复辟资本主义制造舆论。毛主席教导我们：革命的根本问题是政权问题。无产阶级专政是劳动人民的命根子。敌人想动无产阶级政权一分一毫，我们就要同它决一死战！“唤起工农千百万，同心干”！我们一定要为巩固和加强无产阶级专政而大演革命现代戏，大唱革命歌。我们一定要高举毛主席的无产阶级革命文艺路线的伟大旗帜，使文艺永远成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。
