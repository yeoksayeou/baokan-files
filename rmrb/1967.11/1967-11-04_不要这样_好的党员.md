Title: Don't Be This Kind of "Good Party Member"

For a long time, the Chinese Khrushchev has been posing as an authority on “party-building,” using the “red flag” to oppose the red flag, attempting to turn Communist Party members into slaves of the bourgeoisie, in order to achieve his goal of usurping the party and the state. In 1940, he published “Becoming a Good Party Member, Building a Good Party,” which is the sister work of his treacherous “Black Cultivation.” According to his so-called “good party member” standards, they can be summarized into three points: first, to treat “public affairs” as “one’s own affairs”; second, to consider whether something is “worthwhile” for “oneself” in every matter; third, to seek “one’s own victory” in the “party’s victory.” These three standards all emphasize the word “I.”

Chairman Mao said: “A Communist Party member should be open-hearted, loyal, and active, regarding revolutionary interests as the first priority, subordinating personal interests to revolutionary interests; at all times and in all places, adhering to correct principles, and tirelessly struggling against all incorrect thoughts and behaviors, in order to strengthen the collective life of the party, strengthen the bond between the party and the masses; caring more about the party and the masses than about oneself, caring more about others than about oneself. Only then can one be considered a Communist Party member.” Chairman Mao often taught us to be selfless, to serve the public, and to be public-spirited and selfless.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev actually said that “one should treat what belongs to the party and the public as one’s own, treat public property as one’s own… treat the party’s public work as one’s own work,” “only in this way can we have the lofty spirit of sacrificing and struggling for the public cause… and become a good party member.” He also claimed: “The public and the personal are unified here.”

The Chinese Khrushchev, starting from his bourgeois nature, regards “one’s own affairs” as the most precious, and uses the attitude towards one’s own affairs as the highest standard for observing and handling issues. This is to take “I” as the center, to start from “oneself” to deal with “public affairs” and “public causes.” The “unity of the public and the personal” that he advocates is to blur the boundary between “public” and “private,” to “serve the public” for personal private interests, and ultimately to dissolve the “public” into the “private.”

Myself, myself, everything is for myself! This is the most fitting description of the Chinese Khrushchev’s ugly soul and the great exposure of his evil plot to use bourgeois worldviews to transform the party.

Chairman Mao taught: “We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there, that is a good comrade.” He also said: “To struggle means there will be sacrifices… We die for the people, and that is a worthy death.” Our revolutionary forerunners, precisely following Chairman Mao’s teachings, struggled and sacrificed for the liberation of all humanity. Dong Cunrui sacrificed himself to blow up the fortress, Wang Jie threw himself on the grenade to save the militia, Huang Jiguang used his body to block the enemy’s gun port, and Ouyang Hai, at the moment when he needed to contribute his life, achieved “unflinching courage.”

The Chinese Khrushchev, however, starting from the “I,” created a scale. The scale beam is “fame, profit, power,” and the scale pan is “I.” He used this scale to measure whether it is “worthwhile” to “sacrifice for the party’s and the laboring masses’ public cause.” He thought that such a sacrifice “most arouses people’s admiration and is most remembered and praised by future generations,” so it is “most worthwhile.” In the end, it still comes down to an “I.”

Pah! According to the Chinese Khrushchev’s fallacy, are our countless revolutionary forerunners who shed their heads and blood all for “arousing people’s admiration” and “being remembered and praised by future generations”? This is the greatest slander against our revolutionary forerunners and also fully exposes his ugly soul.

Chairman Mao taught: “We must be especially vigilant against personal careerists and conspirators like Khrushchev, and prevent such bad people from usurping the leadership of the party and the state at all levels.”

The Chinese Khrushchev said: “Party members can only have their own victories in the party’s victories. Therefore, we must definitely build a good party…” It turns out that the Chinese Khrushchev wants to build a “good party” so that this “party” can make “oneself” reap “victories” from it. The “good party member” he talks about is someone who spends a lifetime developing “oneself” in the development of the party’s cause.

How to obtain “one’s own victories” and “development”? According to the Chinese Khrushchev’s “Cultivation,” one must “respect oneself,” “love oneself,” “know how to handle oneself,” and be “most tolerant, forgiving, and ‘yield to achieve harmony.’” According to him, following this path, “even if one does not have an important position today, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, there will still be an important position for him.” This is the Chinese Khrushchev’s self-portrait of “I am everything.”

“Self” is the core of the bourgeois worldview. The three standards of the “good party member” proposed by the Chinese Khrushchev are to use the bourgeois worldview to transform our party, to transform the thoughts of Communist Party members, and to realize his counter-revolutionary plot to usurp the party. We Communist Party members must take “struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism” as the guideline, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, thoroughly criticize the entire set of bourgeois selfish philosophy advocated by the Chinese Khrushchev, fiercely struggle against the “self” in our minds, uproot the roots of revisionism, and become genuine Communist Party members.

### 不要这样“好的党员”

    不要这样“好的党员”
    广州部队　任志左
    长期以来，中国赫鲁晓夫以“建党”权威自居，打着“红旗”反红旗，妄图把共产党员变为资产阶级的奴仆，以达到其篡党篡国的目的。他在一九四○年发表的《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》，是背叛无产阶级专政的黑《修养》的姊妹篇。照他所谓“好党员”的标准，可以归纳成为三条：一曰：要把“公共事物”当作“自己的事物”；二曰：逢事都要看看对“自己”“值得不值得”；三曰：在“党的胜利中”追求“自己的胜利”。三条标准，都是突出一个“我”字。
    毛主席说：“一个共产党员，应该是襟怀坦白，忠实，积极，以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益；无论何时何地，坚持正确的原则，同一切不正确的思想和行为作不疲倦的斗争，用以巩固党的集体生活，巩固党和群众的联系；关心党和群众比关心个人为重，关心他人比关心自己为重。这样才算得一个共产党员。”毛主席还经常教导我们，要大公无私，克己奉公，公而忘私。
    可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫竟胡说什么“应该把属于党的公共的事物，当作自己的事物，应把公家的东西当作自己的东西……把党的公共的工作当作自己的工作”，“只有这样，我们才能有为公共事业而牺牲奋斗的高尚的精神，……才成为一个好的党员”。他还声称：“公共的与自己的，在这里表现其一致性”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫从他的资产阶级本性出发，把“自己的事物”看作最宝贵的事物，把对待自己事物的态度作为观察和处理问题的最高标准。这就是要以“我”为中心，从“自己”出发来对待“公共的事物”和“公共事业”。他所鼓吹的“公共的与自己的”“一致性”，就是混淆“公”和“私”的界限，为了个人的私利而去“为公”，最后把“公”字溶化在“私”字里。
    自己，自己，一切都是为了自己！这是中国赫鲁晓夫丑恶灵魂的最恰当的写照，也是他妄图用资产阶级世界观改造党的罪恶阴谋的大暴露。
    毛主席教导说：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”又说：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，……我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”我们的革命先烈，正是遵照毛主席的教导，为着全人类的解放而英勇奋斗牺牲。董存瑞舍身炸碉堡，王杰扑雷救民兵，黄继光用肉体堵住敌人的枪眼，欧阳海在需要贡献出生命的时刻，作到“脸不变色心不跳”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却从“我”字出发，制造了一杆秤。秤星是“名、利、权”，秤铊是“我”。他用这杆秤，去衡量“为党的与劳苦大众的公共事业而牺牲”是否“值得”？他认为这样的牺牲“最引起人们的敬仰，最为万世子孙所怀念所歌颂的”，所以是“最值得的”。说来说去，还是离不开一个“我”字。
    呸！按照中国赫鲁晓夫的这种谬论，我们无数抛头颅洒热血的革命先烈，都是为了“引起人们的敬仰”和“万世子孙所怀念所歌颂”才贡献出自己的生命吗？这是对我们革命先烈最大的污蔑，也正好暴露了他的丑恶灵魂。
    毛主席教导说：“要特别警惕象赫鲁晓夫那样的个人野心家和阴谋家，防止这样的坏人篡夺党和国家的各级领导。”
    中国赫鲁晓夫说什么：“党员只有在党的胜利中才会有自己的胜利。所以我们一定要建设一个好的党……”。原来，中国赫鲁晓夫所以要建设一个“好的党”，就是要使这个“党”能够使“自己”从中捞取“胜利”。他所说的“要作一个终身的好党员”，就是一辈子都要在“发展党的事业”中发展“自己”。
    怎样去得到自己的“胜利”和“发展”呢？按照中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》，就要“自尊”、“自爱”、“善于自处”，“最能宽大、容忍和‘委曲求全’”。据他说，按照这条路走下去，那就“虽然今天没有重要的地位，到明天、后天仍会有重要地位给他的”。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的“我就是一切”的自画像。
    “私”字是资产阶级世界观的核心。中国赫鲁晓夫提出的“好的党员”的三条标准，就是要用资产阶级的世界观来改造我们的党，改造共产党员的思想，以实现其篡党的反革命的阴谋。我们共产党员一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的一整套资产阶级利己主义哲学，狠斗自己头脑里的“私”字，挖掉修正主义的根子，做一个名副其实的共产党员。
