The Soviet people, nurtured by the great Lenin and Stalin and with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, are filled with boundless love for the contemporary world's greatest teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, and with unshakable faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They hail the contemporary highest level of Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought—whose brilliance illuminates the revolutionary path of the Soviet people. They are determined to bravely fight, to break through the dark rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, and to let the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought fly high over the Kremlin.

“Mao Zedong is our Lenin!”

In the Soviet Union, where the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is carrying out a white terror, many revolutionary people, despite the surveillance of secret police, bravely shout to Chinese comrades, "Mao Zedong—Lenin!" This expresses their boundless longing for the great teacher Lenin and their boundless love and respect for the great leader Chairman Mao.

A young Soviet worker once met a Chinese comrade. He affectionately stroked the badge of Chairman Mao on the Chinese comrade's chest and firmly said, "Mao Zedong is our Lenin!" A Georgian once told a Chinese comrade, "We know that Mao Zedong defends Leninism. The people in our area all respect Mao Zedong." He took out a portrait of Chairman Mao he had drawn and said, "The hearts of the Georgian people for Mao Zedong will never change! We place our hopes in the Chinese people!" A technician in Kiev said, "Mao Zedong and Lenin are the greatest leaders. We all love them." He then said with great confidence, "Mao Zedong, the hope of the Soviet people!" In Karaganda, a Chinese comrade and several old miners were talking in a park. When the conversation turned to Chairman Mao's theories on building communism and the world revolution, an old miner said to the other miners in a tone of great respect and certainty, "This is the principle of Lenin, this is the viewpoint of Marxism-Leninism."

Once, the Soviet revisionist clique hung portraits of Soviet revisionist leaders Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others on Lenin Square in Voronezh. A Soviet person pointed at these portraits with contempt and said, "I don't know who they are. I only know the portraits of Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong!" This reflected the Soviet people's deep hatred for the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, their boundless longing for Lenin and Stalin, and their boundless trust in Chairman Mao.

“In our hearts, we forever shout, ‘Long live Mao Zedong!’”

“Mao Zedong!” This is the most brilliant name in the contemporary world, and it is also the name most beloved by the Soviet people. An old man in Moscow's Red Square, upon seeing a Chinese comrade, excitedly raised his thumb and shouted, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" When the police pulled him aside and viciously scolded him, he still continued to shout loudly, "Mao Zedong!" Then he ran back and stood firmly with the Chinese comrade, demanding a photo together, and cursed the Khrushchev revisionist clique. An old worker in Moscow said, "They don't let us shout, ‘Long live Mao Zedong!’ But we still shout it in our hearts, forever shouting it!" In Leningrad, an old worker with white hair would shout, "Long live Mao Zedong!" in Chinese whenever he met a Chinese comrade. He said passionately, "I love Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong is in my heart!" Sometimes, when Chinese comrades walked on the streets of some Soviet cities, they would hear someone shouting "Mao Zedong," but they couldn't see who was shouting. Once, a Chinese comrade on the streets of Kharkov met a Soviet person who asked, "Are you Chinese?" The Chinese comrade replied, "Yes." The Soviet person immediately said in Chinese, "Long live Chairman Mao!"

The Soviet people express their deep feelings and boundless love for Chairman Mao in various ways. Once, a Chinese comrade in the Soviet Union received a postcard signed by an ordinary Soviet person. This was one of the few postcards that escaped being confiscated by the Soviet authorities from countless similar letters. The postcard read, "To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, please convey my best wishes to Comrade Mao Zedong. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest leader who has never wavered in opposing the betrayal of Lenin-Stalin teachings at any time." Another time, a Chinese comrade in the Soviet Union received a phone call: "Salute to Mao Zedong! Long live the friendship between the peoples of the Soviet Union and China!" Once, a poster was pasted on the wall opposite the Moscow Department Store, and someone wrote on it, "I love China, especially..." A viewer saw a Chinese comrade and pointed to the words on the poster, raising his thumb and saying, "Love Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!"

Many Soviet people, when they see Chinese comrades wearing badges of Chairman Mao, often gaze at them with deep affection, pointing at the badge of Chairman Mao and then at their own chest, expressing their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao. A young man in his twenties in Moscow stopped a Chinese comrade on the street, looked meaningfully at the badge of Chairman Mao on the Chinese comrade's chest, and held his hand, kissing it repeatedly, then reluctantly left. When Soviet people obtain photographs of Chairman Mao and badges of Chairman Mao, their faces always show boundless happiness, or they shout with joy. In the Baku oil fields on the sea, a Chinese comrade gave badges of Chairman Mao and photographs of Chairman Mao receiving the Red Guards to oil workers. A worker held the badge of Chairman Mao above his head and shouted loudly, "Long live Mao Zedong!" Some people carefully placed the badge of Chairman Mao in the pocket of their inner clothing, gently stroking it again and again. A Soviet couple proudly wore shining gold badges of Chairman Mao on their chests. When Soviet secret police discovered this, they repeatedly threatened the couple and forced them to take off the badges. However, as soon as the Soviet secret police left, the couple took out the badges of Chairman Mao again and respectfully wore them on their chests. They said resolutely, "We must love Chairman Mao!"

“Mao Zedong Thought will help us carry out the second revolution”

The Soviet working people have boundless admiration for Mao Zedong Thought and highly praise Chairman Mao's works. A Soviet person told a Chinese comrade, "Chairman Mao's works have great significance for the world revolutionary struggle." A student in Moscow said, "Lenin led the October Revolution. After his death, Stalin led the construction of socialism. Now, only Mao Zedong can lead us. We must study Chairman Mao's works well." A Soviet worker, in order to read Chairman Mao's books, tried every means to buy Chairman Mao's works. After two years of effort, he finally bought the Russian edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." A Soviet engineer on an international train told a Chinese train attendant, "Chairman Mao is a great Marxist-Leninist of our time, a great leader of the world's people. We respect him as we respect Lenin and Stalin. I urgently need Mao Zedong's books!" When he received two copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and three badges of Chairman Mao, he sincerely said, "I will study Chairman Mao's works with my wife. I will educate my children to love Mao Zedong!" A young man from a Ukrainian village pointed out, "Mao Zedong's words are the most correct, Mao Zedong's books are the truth. He leads the people to build communism, eliminate private ownership, and oppose imperialism. We need Mao Zedong Thought!" A young Soviet man in Moscow's Red Square met a Chinese comrade. After obtaining a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," he pointed at the Kremlin, which was usurped by the Soviet revisionist clique, and said angrily, "Bad! Bad!" Then he stroked the red book and said, "The Soviet people need this book!" When the Soviet leadership clique unreasonably expelled Chinese students, many Soviet people told the Chinese students, "The Soviet government can expel you, but Mao Zedong Thought, which has already entered the hearts of the Soviet people, cannot be expelled by anyone!" An old worker pointed out, "The Soviet people need to carry out a second revolution." Then he said with great confidence, "Mao Zedong Thought will help us carry out the second revolution."

The great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao has received the most enthusiastic praise from the Soviet people. A driver said, "Mao Zedong is leading the cultural revolution to overthrow bourgeois ideology. China is building communism, while in the Soviet Union, they are building capitalism." An old professor in Moscow, when talking about the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, said, "This shows that Mao Zedong is the most brilliant leader. The Communist Party of China is the true Marxist-Leninist party." A graduate student said, "I have always supported Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought has enriched the treasury of Marxism-Leninism. I wish the Chinese cultural revolution greater achievements!" A Soviet person also pointed out passionately, "Lenin once led the great October Revolution, and his name spread all over the world; today, Comrade Mao Zedong is leading the proletarian cultural revolution in China, and his name will also spread all over the world. The influence of the Chinese cultural revolution will also be like the October Revolution, spreading throughout the Soviet Union and the world!"

Become a soldier of Chairman Mao and oppose the Soviet revisionist clique

A young revolutionary in the Soviet Union, in a letter expressing the strong revolutionary will of the broad masses of the Soviet people, solemnly declared to the contemporary world's greatest teacher of the proletariat, Chairman Mao, "Dear Comrade Mao Zedong, I am determined to become your soldier and fight to the end against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership! I swear to fight for the realization of your thought in our country, sparing no effort, even my life! I swear to fight for the re-emergence of true Marxism-Leninism in our country! I firmly believe that your thought will definitely become the guiding principle for all our work. In the future, all the people of the world will see that the banner of true Marxism-Leninism—your thought—will rise over the Kremlin!"

This is not an ordinary letter; it is the battle cry of the heroic people of Lenin's hometown! It is a thunderous proclamation to denounce the traitorous scoundrels! It is a declaration of war against modern revisionism! It is the distant thunder rumbling in the sky, and the imminent storm that will sweep away all the ghosts and demons on Soviet soil!

The great Soviet people's boundless love and unshakable faith in Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, as well as their determination to fight to the end with the Soviet revisionist clique, have already and will continue to prove the brilliant judgment of the contemporary proletariat's most outstanding leader, Chairman Mao: "The broad masses of the people, the broad masses of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union, are good, they want revolution, the rule of revisionism will not last long."

    苏联人民无限热爱当代的列宁——毛泽东
    毛泽东思想的光辉照亮苏联人民革命的道路
    决心勇敢战斗，让马列主义、毛泽东思想伟大旗帜在克里姆林宫上空高高飘扬
    新华社八日讯　莫斯科消息：由伟大的列宁和斯大林所教养的、有着十月革命光荣传统的苏联革命人民，在苏修叛徒集团的白色恐怖下，在同这个集团进行激烈的阶级斗争中，充满着对当代世界无产阶级最伟大的导师毛主席的无限热爱、对战无不胜的毛泽东思想的无限信仰。他们欢呼当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了苏联人民革命的道路，他们决心勇敢战斗，冲破苏修集团的黑暗统治，让马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜在克里姆林宫上空高高飘扬。
        “毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”
    在苏修领导集团实行白色恐怖的苏联，许许多多革命的人民，常常怀着满腔的激情，不顾特务的监视，勇敢地对中国同志喊一声：“毛泽东—列宁！”以表达他们对伟大导师列宁的无限怀念，对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇敬。
    一位年轻的苏联工人有一次遇到了中国同志，他亲切地抚摸着中国同志胸前佩戴的毛主席像章，坚定地说：“毛泽东就是我们的列宁！”一个格鲁吉亚人曾经对中国同志说：“我们都知道，毛泽东保卫列宁主义，我们那里人民人人敬爱毛泽东。”他拿出自己画的毛主席像说：“格鲁吉亚人民对毛泽东的心永远不会变！我们把希望寄托在中国人民的身上！”基辅市一位技术员说：“毛泽东和列宁，是最伟大的领袖，我们都热爱他们。”他又满怀信心地说：“毛泽东，苏联人民的希望！”中国同志在卡吉也夫和几位老矿工在公园里交谈，当谈到毛主席关于共产主义建设和世界革命等理论时，一位老矿工对其他几位矿工用十分敬佩、十分肯定的口吻说：“这才是列宁的原则，这才是马列主义观点。”
    有一次，苏修集团在沃罗涅什市的列宁广场上挂上了苏修头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金等人的像，一位苏联人鄙视地指着这些像说：“不知道他们是谁，我只知道列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的像！”这反映了苏联人民对苏修领导集团无比愤恨，对列宁和斯大林无限怀念，对毛主席无限信赖。
    “我们心里永远喊着毛泽东万岁！”
    “毛泽东！”这是当代世界上最最光辉的名字，也是苏联人民最最热爱的名字。一位老人在莫斯科红场见到中国同志，便兴奋地翘起大拇指欢呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”当警察把他拉在一旁恶毒地训斥他时，他还是继续大声高呼：“毛泽东！”随后他又跑过来，紧紧地同中国同志站在一起，要求合影留念，并且痛骂赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团。莫斯科一位老工人说：“他们不让我们喊毛泽东万岁，但是我们心里仍在喊，永远在喊！”在列宁格勒，一位白发苍苍的工人每遇到中国同志，他就用中国话高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”他热情地说：“我爱毛泽东，毛泽东在我的心里！”有时候，中国同志在苏联一些城市的街上行走，只听见有人呼喊“毛泽东”的声音，却看不到喊的人在什么地方。中国同志有一次在哈尔科夫街头碰到一位苏联人，对方问：“是中国人吗？”答：“是。”他马上用中国话说：“毛主席万岁！”
    苏联人民用各种方式表达他们对毛主席的深厚感情和无限热爱。一次，在苏联的中国同志收到了由一个普通苏联人署名的明信片，这是从苏修当局扣押的无数这类信件中幸免被扣的一封。明信片中写着：“中共中央，请向毛泽东同志转致最好的祝愿。毛泽东同志是在任何时候都毫不动摇地反对背叛列宁—斯大林学说的一位最伟大的领袖。”还有一次，在苏联的中国同志接到这样一个电话：“向毛泽东致敬！苏中两国人民的友谊万岁！”有一次，贴在莫斯科百货公司对面的一张海报上，有人写道：“我爱中国，特别地爱……”海报前有位观众见到中国同志就指着上面的字竖起大拇指说：“爱毛泽东，毛泽东！”
    很多苏联人，在看到中国同志胸前佩戴着毛主席像章时，常常用深情的目光注视着，指着毛主席像章，又指着自己的胸口，表示他们对毛主席无限爱戴。莫斯科一位二十来岁的苏联人，在街上拉住一个中国同志，意味深长地看着中国同志胸前的毛主席像章，并拉着他的手吻了又吻，然后依依不舍地离去。当苏联人民得到毛主席照片和毛主席像章时，他们的脸上总是流露出无限幸福的表情，或者欢呼起来。在巴库海上油田，中国同志把毛主席像章和毛主席接见红卫兵的照片送给石油工人，一位工人把毛主席像章举过头顶，放声高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”有的人把毛主席像章小心翼翼地放到贴身衣服的口袋里，一次又一次地轻轻抚摸着。有一对苏联夫妇在胸前骄傲地佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章。苏修特务发现后，再三威胁这对夫妇，强迫他们把像章摘下来。但是，当苏修特务一离开，这对夫妇就又把毛主席像章拿出来，恭恭敬敬地佩戴在胸前。他们斩钉截铁地说：“我们就是要热爱毛主席！”
  “毛泽东思想将帮助我们搞第二次革命”
    苏联劳动人民无限崇拜毛泽东思想，高度赞扬毛主席著作。一位苏联人对中国同志说：“毛主席的著作对世界革命斗争具有伟大意义。”莫斯科的一位学生说：“列宁领导了十月革命，他死后有斯大林领导建设社会主义。现在只有靠毛泽东，要好好学习毛泽东的著作。”一位苏联工人为了读到毛主席的书，想方设法购买毛主席著作，经过两年的努力，终于买到了俄文版《毛泽东选集》。一位苏联工程师在国际列车上对中国列车员说：“毛主席是当代伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是世界人民的伟大领袖，我们象尊敬列宁和斯大林一样地尊敬他。我迫切需要毛泽东的书！”当他得到两本《毛主席语录》和三枚毛主席像章时，他诚挚地说：“我要同爱人一起学习毛主席著作，我要教育自己的孩子热爱毛泽东！”乌克兰的一位农村青年指出：“毛泽东的话最正确，毛泽东的书是真理。他领导人民建设共产主义、消灭私有制和反对帝国主义。我们需要毛泽东思想！”一位苏联青年在莫斯科红场上遇到了中国同志。他向中国同志索取了一本《毛主席语录》后，用手指着苏修集团窃据的克里姆林宫愤愤地说：“坏！坏！”又用手抚摸着红色宝书说：“苏联人民需要这本书！”当苏修领导集团无理赶走中国留学生时，许多苏联人对中国留学生说：“苏联政府可以赶走你们，但是已经进入苏联人民心里的毛泽东思想是任何人也赶不走的！”一位老工人指出：“苏联人民需要进行第二次革命。”接着他又充满信心地说：“毛泽东思想将帮助我们搞第二次革命。”
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，受到了苏联人民最热烈的颂扬。一位汽车司机说：“毛泽东在领导文化大革命，要打倒资产阶级思想。中国搞的是共产主义，而在苏联却在搞资本主义。”莫斯科一位老教授谈到中国无产阶级文化大革命时说：“这说明毛泽东是最英明的领袖。中国共产党是真正的马克思列宁主义的党。”一位研究生说：“我一贯拥护毛泽东思想，毛泽东思想丰富了马克思列宁主义的宝库。祝中国文化大革命取得更大的成就！”一位苏联人还满怀激情地指出：“列宁曾领导伟大的十月革命，他的名字传遍全世界；今天，毛泽东同志领导着中国的无产阶级文化革命，他的名字也传遍全世界。中国文化大革命的影响也将和十月革命一样，传遍苏联，传遍全世界！”
    做毛主席的战士　造苏修集团的反
    一位苏联革命青年，在一封表达了苏联广大人民强烈的革命意志的信中，向当代无产阶级最伟大的导师毛主席庄严宣誓：“亲爱的毛泽东同志，我决心成为您的战士，誓为反对以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义而奋斗到底！我宣誓为您的思想在我国的实现而奋斗，不惜一切力量，甚至生命！我宣誓为真正的马克思列宁主义在我国重放光芒而奋斗！我坚信您的思想一定会成为我国各项工作的指针。将来，全世界人民一定会看到，在克里姆林宫上空升起真正的马克思列宁主义——您的思想的旗帜！”
    这不是一篇普普通通的信，这是列宁故乡的英雄人民的战斗心声！这是声讨工贼叛徒们的气吞山河的檄文！这是同现代修正主义决战的宣言书！这是轰鸣在天际的隐约可闻的惊雷，随之而来的将是要把苏联国土上一切牛鬼蛇神通通扫光的急风暴雨！
    伟大的苏联人民对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限信仰以及他们要同苏修叛徒集团斗争到底的决心，已经并将继续证明当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖毛主席的英明论断：“苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。”
