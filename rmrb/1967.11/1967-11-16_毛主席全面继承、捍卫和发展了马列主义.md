Progressive Figures in Pakistan Hail Mao Zedong Thought as Guiding World Revolutionary Movement

Chairman Mao Fully Inherits, Defends, and Develops Marxism-Leninism

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Rawalpindi, progressive figures in Pakistan enthusiastically hailed the great Mao Zedong Thought as guiding the revolutionary movements of the entire world during the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution. They angrily denounced the Soviet revisionist leading group for betraying the October Revolution and conspiring with U.S. imperialism to suppress all world revolutionary movements.

A Pakistani friend wrote in a letter to a Xinhua News Agency reporter, “Chairman Mao Zedong fully inherits, defends, and develops Marxism-Leninism. Through summarizing the new experiences of class struggle in China, the Soviet Union, and other regions of the world, he creatively proposed the great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao marks a new stage in the development of Marxism in its struggle against revisionism. The oppressed peoples of the entire world, in their struggle for liberation, eagerly await guidance from China and its great leader Chairman Mao Zedong. It is precisely the great Mao Zedong Thought that is guiding the revolutionary movements of the entire world.”

The letter states, “As Chairman Mao said, ‘The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with the will of people.’ The betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leading group is a setback, but it is also a good lesson for all humanity engaged in struggle and proves Chairman Mao’s thesis that class struggle still exists in socialist society and that revolution must continue under the dictatorship of the proletariat.”

The letter states, “The Soviet revisionist group that began to slander Stalin at the 20th Congress of the CPSU has now reached the point of openly colluding with U.S. imperialism. Their revisionist theories of ‘peaceful coexistence,’ ‘peaceful competition,’ and ‘peaceful transition’ are equivalent to conspiring with U.S. imperialism to suppress all world revolutionary movements, which has completely trampled on the banner of the October Revolution.”

A Pakistani friend in the news industry said, while enthusiastically celebrating the great October Revolution Festival, people angrily saw that the most loyal followers of Khrushchev—Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang of traitors—attempted to use this opportunity to slander the world’s true revolutionaries. They attempt to use Marxist-Leninist phrases, deceptive slogans, and hypocritical “commemorative” activities as a smokescreen to cover up their collusion with imperialists, which will absolutely not succeed.

He said, “As the true successors of the great October Revolution, the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union will soon bring these traitors to the dock of the accused and severely punish them for their heinous crimes.”

    巴基斯坦进步人士欢呼毛泽东思想指导着世界革命运动
    毛主席全面继承、捍卫和发展了马列主义
    据新华社拉瓦尔品第电　巴基斯坦进步人士在十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候，热情欢呼伟大的毛泽东思想正在指导着全世界的革命运动；愤怒谴责苏修领导集团背叛十月革命，并同美帝国主义共谋镇压一切世界革命运动。
    一位巴基斯坦朋友在写给新华社记者的信中说：“毛泽东主席全面继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义；并且通过总结中国、苏联和世界其他地区的阶级斗争的新经验，创造性地提出了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命的伟大理论。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命标志着马克思主义在同修正主义斗争中发展的一个新阶段。全世界被压迫人民在争取解放的斗争中，盼望着从中国和中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席那里得到指导。正是伟大的毛泽东思想在指导着全世界的革命运动。”
    信件说：“正如毛主席所说：‘社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。’苏修领导集团的背叛虽然是一个挫折，但是对全体进行斗争的人类也是一个良好的教训，并且证明了毛泽东主席关于在社会主义社会中仍然存在着阶级斗争和在无产阶级专政下必须继续进行革命的论断。”
    信件说：“在苏共二十大就开始诽谤斯大林的苏联修正主义集团，现在已经达到公开同美帝国主义勾结的地步。它的‘和平共处’、‘和平竞赛’和‘和平过渡’的修正主义理论，等于同美帝国主义共谋镇压一切世界革命运动，这已经完全践踏了十月革命的旗帜。”
    巴基斯坦的一位新闻界的朋友说，在热烈庆祝伟大十月革命节的同时，人们愤怒地看到，赫鲁晓夫最忠实的门徒——勃列日涅夫、柯西金及其一伙叛徒，企图利用这个机会中伤世界真正的革命者。他们企图通过马克思列宁主义词句、骗人的口号和虚伪的“纪念”活动作烟幕，来掩盖他们同帝国主义者相互勾结，这是绝对不能得逞的。
    他说：“作为伟大十月革命真正继承者的革命的苏联人民把这些叛徒揪到罪犯被告席上，对他们的滔天罪行严加惩罚的日子很快就会到来的。”
