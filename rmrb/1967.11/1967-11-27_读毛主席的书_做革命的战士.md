A worker from a factory in Thanh Hoa, Vietnam, was overjoyed to hear that the Vietnamese edition of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" had arrived in Hanoi. He was so excited that he couldn't sleep. The next day, he couldn't wait to take the bus to Hanoi, so he rode his bicycle all night to get there. He obtained a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" from Chinese comrades, cherishing it as a treasure. Upon returning, he studied it for an hour every day and diligently wrote down his study notes. In his notes, he wrote: "Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time, the helmsman and commander of the world's people, the beacon and hope of humanity."

A cadre from the Lao People's Liberation Army in the Khammouane region carefully cuts out every quote from Chairman Mao published in the Lao edition of "News and Telecommunications" by the New China News Agency in Khamkeut and compiles them into a booklet, studying it diligently. He said, "The quotations from Chairman Mao are instructions."

During a battle against American air pirates, a soldier from a certain unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army was hit by a bullet and fell into a pool of blood. Sensing his impending martyrdom for the revolution, he struggled with his last ounce of strength to take out a copy of Chairman Mao's works, stained with his own blood, from his pocket and handed it to a comrade beside him. He then instructed, "Study it well!"

In an Arab country, two Palestinian friends visited a Chinese friend's residence. Upon entering, they saw a portrait of Chairman Mao on the wall and respectfully saluted with a raised hand. They then took out a handkerchief and gently wiped the frame of Chairman Mao's portrait, showing their utmost respect. When they saw the quotation from Vice Chairman Lin on the wall, they immediately read it aloud together: "Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage." After reading, both of them took out their notebooks and copied down the quotation, repeatedly saying, "Excellent, so correct! It speaks for the hearts of the Palestinian people."

A friend from Guinea spends fifteen minutes each day reading Chairman Mao's works and another fifteen minutes reading Chinese magazines. He wrote in a letter to his Chinese friends that Chairman Mao's teaching, "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," is an inspiring sentence. He said, "This sentence gives the revolutionary faction boundless strength."

He wrote in the letter, "Only by studying Chairman Mao's works can one persist in the revolution to the end. I raise my hands high to cheer for Chairman Mao's name. From now on, I am determined to redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's works, to engrave every word of Chairman Mao in my heart, so as to help me smash the main enemy of the revolution—imperialism and the old and new colonialist shackles. I am ready at any time to follow the leader of the revolutionary people, Comrade Mao Zedong, into battle. With Chairman Mao, we can launch a resolute attack on bourgeois ideology and old habits, and sweep away all harmful elements."

A Guatemalan youth studying in the German Democratic Republic studies Chairman Mao's works very diligently. He fills his personal copy of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with study notes and marks important points with colored pens. He often says, "The experience of the Chinese revolution is all concentrated in Chairman Mao's books. This is a great development of Marxism-Leninism." He highly praises Chairman Mao's brilliant statement that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and firmly believes that armed struggle is the only way to national liberation. One day, he saw a photo of Chairman Mao in military uniform and cap, and was very excited. He immediately found his Chinese friends and earnestly requested, "When you return to your country, please bring me back a military cap like the one Chairman Mao is wearing. I want to wear it and go back to my country to fight guerrilla warfare in the mountains."

A young student from Yugoslavia said that he managed to get a copy of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," but after a few days, it was borrowed by his friend. Now his friend has finished reading the red book and has carefully marked many places with red ink.

A university student majoring in philosophy read the first volume of the Serbian edition of the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." He deeply felt that the Chinese people's grasp of Mao Zedong Thought not only has great significance for China but also for the whole world.

Some young students also voluntarily organized to study Chairman Mao's works. For the convenience of study, they divided the work of translating the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" into Serbian. A student enthusiastically told a Chinese comrade, "We young people, as Chairman Mao said, are like the sun at eight or nine in the morning, with the least conservative thoughts." Some students study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in class and ask their teachers to study as well.

    读毛主席的书　做革命的战士
    天天学习《毛主席语录》
    越南太原市某工厂一位技术干部听到河内运来了越文版《毛主席语录》的喜讯后，高兴得连觉也睡不着了。第二天坐汽车去河内就来不及了，为了得到宝书，他连夜骑自行车赶到河内。他从中国同志处得到一本《毛主席语录》，如获至宝，回去后每天学习一个小时，并且认真写学习心得。他在学习笔记中写道：“毛主席是当代的列宁，世界人民的舵手和统帅，人类的灯塔和希望。”
    要战友好好地读毛主席著作
    老挝人民解放军川圹地区部队一位干部，把新华社康开分社出版的每期老文《新闻电讯》上登的毛主席语录都小心翼翼地剪下来，精心汇编成册，孜孜不倦地学习。他说：“毛主席语录就是指示。”
    在一次反击美国空中强盗的战斗中，老挝人民解放军某部一位战士中弹倒在血泊中。他预感到自己将要为革命牺牲了，就用尽全力挣扎着从怀里掏出一本被鲜血染红了的毛主席著作，交给他身旁的一位战友，并且嘱咐说：“要好好地读！”
    说出了巴勒斯坦人民心中的话
    在一个阿拉伯国家，两位巴勒斯坦朋友有一次到中国朋友住处拜访。一进门，他们看见房子的墙上挂着毛主席像，便恭恭敬敬地行了举手礼。然后，他们掏出手帕，轻轻地擦了擦毛主席像镜框，表示对毛主席无比尊敬。当看到墙上贴着的林副主席的语录时，他俩立刻同声读了起来：“毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东同志天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。”读后，两个人不约而同地拿出笔记本，把这段语录抄了下来，并且连连说：“太好了，说得太正确了！说出了巴勒斯坦人民心中的话。”
    把毛主席的每一句话刻在心坎上
    几内亚一位朋友，每天用十五分钟时间阅读毛主席著作，再用十五分钟时间阅读中国杂志。他写信给中国朋友说，毛主席教导说：“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”，这是一句激动人心的话，这句话对革命派来说是无穷的力量。
    他在信中说：“学习毛主席著作，才能将革命坚持到底，我高举双手欢呼毛主席的名字。从现在起，我决心加倍努力学习毛主席著作，把毛主席的每一句话都刻在心坎上，以便帮助我去粉碎革命的主要敌人——帝国主义和新老殖民主义的枷锁。我随时准备跟随革命人民的领袖毛泽东同志战斗。有毛主席，我们就能够向资产阶级思想意识、旧习惯势力发起坚决的进攻，扫除一切害人虫。”
    毛主席指出民族解放的道路
    一位在德意志民主共和国学习的危地马拉青年，学习毛主席著作非常努力。他在随身携带的《毛泽东选集》上，写满了学习心得，还用色笔记上符号。他经常说：“中国革命的经验全部集中在毛主席的书里，这是马克思列宁主义的大发展。”他高度赞扬毛主席的关于
  “枪杆子里面出政权”的英明论断，并深信武装斗争是民族解放的唯一出路。一天，他看到了一张毛主席穿军装戴军帽的照片，非常激动，立刻去找中国朋友，恳切地要求说：“你们回国后一定要给我带回一顶毛主席戴的这种军帽。我要戴着它，回国上山打游击。”
    组织起来学习毛主席著作
    一位南斯拉夫青年学生说，他好不容易得到一本《毛主席语录》，没过几天又被他的朋友要去了。现在他的朋友已经读完了这本红书，把许多地方用红笔仔细地划了出来。
    一个学哲学的大学生读完了塞尔维亚文版《毛泽东选集》第一卷。他深有体会地对中国同志说：“中国人民掌握了毛泽东思想，这不仅对中国，而且对全世界都有重大意义。”
    有的青年学生还自动地组织起来学习毛主席著作。为了学习方便，他们分工把《毛主席语录》译成塞尔维亚文。一位学生兴致勃勃地向中国同志说：“我们青年人正象毛主席说的，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳，最少保守思想。”有的学生在课堂上学习《毛主席语录》，要求老师也学习。
