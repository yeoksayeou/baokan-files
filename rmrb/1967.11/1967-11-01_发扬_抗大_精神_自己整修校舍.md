Tonghua No. 2 Middle School's revolutionary teachers and students, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army's Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the school, have carried forward the revolutionary spirit of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University. They have taken the initiative to repair school buildings and winter heating facilities, ensuring the smooth implementation of the campaign to resume classes and make revolution.

Recently, the revolutionary teachers and students of this school have responded positively to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call to resume classes and make revolution. They have taken "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, achieved revolutionary great unity by classes, and resumed classes and made revolution. In the past, the repair of school buildings and the installation and repair of winter heating facilities were all dependent on state funds, hiring carpenters and masons, which required a large amount of maintenance funds. This year, under the guidance of the PLA comrades, the revolutionary teachers and students have seriously studied Chairman Mao's great directive to "be thrifty and make revolution." They have also visited the exhibition on the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University's self-reliance and thrift in running the school, which is currently on display in Tonghua City. The broad revolutionary teachers and students unanimously decided to take the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as an example, take the initiative to repair school buildings and winter heating facilities. They start from being thrifty, using old items to replace new ones, and not spending money if they can avoid it. When they lacked tools, they borrowed from relevant units; when they lacked materials, they collected and utilized discarded materials. Through the joint efforts of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team stationed at the school and the revolutionary teachers and students, they have finally repaired all the doors, windows, and walls of the entire school to a new state, and completed the repair of winter heating facilities. The classrooms inside and outside are clean and tidy, and the school has a new look. The revolutionary teachers and students excitedly said, "Repairing school buildings and winter heating facilities by ourselves not only saves the state's financial expenditure but also gives us a profound education."

    发扬“抗大”精神　自己整修校舍
    通化二中革命师生勤俭办校，把校舍和防寒设备维修一新，保证复课闹革命顺利进行
    新华社长春三十一日电　吉林省通化市第二中学的革命师生，在驻校人民解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，发扬“抗大”的革命精神，自己动手整修校舍和防寒设备，做好冬季防寒取暖工作，保证复课闹革命顺利进行。
    最近，这个学校的革命师生坚决响应毛主席、党中央复课闹革命的战斗号召，以“斗私，批修”为纲，实现了按教学班级的革命大联合，实行复课闹革命。过去，学校校舍的整修和冬季防寒取暖设备的安装修理，都是依靠国家拿钱，请木工、瓦工整修，需要很大一笔维修费用。今年，革命师生在解放军同志帮助下，认真学习了毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，并参观了正在通化市展出的抗日军政大学坚持自力更生、勤俭办校的事迹展览。广大革命师生一致决定，以“抗大”为榜样，自己动手，整修校舍和防寒取暖设备。他们一切从勤俭出发，能用旧的代替，绝不用新的，能不花钱的就不花钱。没有工具，他们向有关单位借用；没有材料，他们拣拾废旧材料，加以利用。经过驻校毛泽东思想宣传队和革命师生的共同努力，他们终于把全校的门窗、墙壁都整修一新，冬季防寒取暖设备也整修完毕。教室内外干净整齐，学校面貌焕然一新。革命师生兴奋地说，自己动手整修校舍和防寒取暖设备，不仅为国家节省了经费开支，而且也使自己受到了一次深刻的教育。
