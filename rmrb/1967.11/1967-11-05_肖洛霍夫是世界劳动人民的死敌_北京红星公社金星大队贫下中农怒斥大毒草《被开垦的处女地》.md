**Sholokhov is the Enemy of the World's Laboring People**

**--- Beijing Hongxing Commune Jinxing Brigade Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Criticize the Poisonous Weed "Virgin Soil Upturned"**

*"Virgin Soil Upturned"* is one of the representative works of the father of revisionist literature, Sholokhov. In this work, he beautifies the class enemies, defames the poor and lower-middle peasants, and viciously attacks the Soviet Union's agricultural collectivization movement of the 1930s, fully exposing his hostile face towards the laboring people.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Jinxing Brigade of Beijing Hongxing Commune, holding high the banner of criticizing revisionism with Mao Zedong Thought, have severely criticized *"Virgin Soil Upturned"* based on their own experiences in the agricultural collectivization movement.

**Socialism is the Bright Path**

Poor peasant member Wang Jifa: In the poisonous weed *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Sholokhov depicts the great Soviet agricultural collectivization movement as chaotic and disorganized. Throughout the entire collectivization process, the poor and lower-middle peasants slaughtered livestock, stole seeds, beat cadres, slept during meetings, and worked slowly, showing no enthusiasm for the socialist path. What is particularly infuriating is that the book ends with this sentence: "In the desolate autumn wind, an old man, sad and desperate, guards two lonely graves." Sholokhov implies that this is the outcome of agricultural collectivization. This is a gross slander! We too have walked the path of agricultural collectivization, and the actual situation is not at all like what Sholokhov describes. The benefits that agricultural collectivization has brought us are countless!

Before liberation, the landlords drove my family to ruin. My sister starved to death in the old society. My father, with our family of three, fled from Shandong to the outskirts of Beijing, but the landlords wouldn't even let us into the village. We had to flee again to Zhangjiakou, living in caves like wild animals for a few years, almost being eaten by wolves!

A thunderclap of spring, Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the landlord class, and our family received land. However, because at that time we were farming individually, we were powerless against natural disasters, and I had to go work for others. Chairman Mao said well: "The vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty, improve their lives, and resist natural disasters, have no choice but to unite and advance towards the socialist path to achieve their goals." Chairman Mao's words illuminated our hearts, and we quickly organized ourselves, forming mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and later people's communes. Our production improved year by year, and our lives became more prosperous.

Before liberation, our Jinxing Brigade was a poor place. In good years, each mu of land could yield seventy or eighty jin of grain, but during natural disasters, there would be nothing left. After liberation, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely organized ourselves to take the path of collectivization. In 1955, Chairman Mao personally reviewed our cooperative plan and pointed out to us: "Human development has spanned tens of thousands of years, but it is only now in this place in China that we have obtained the conditions to develop our economy and culture according to a plan. Since obtaining these conditions, the face of our country will change year by year." Hearing Chairman Mao's words, we were full of energy. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we achieved one bumper harvest after another. Grain yield increased from seventy or eighty jin per mu to seven or eight hundred jin. All of this is thanks to collectivization! The great changes in our Jinxing Brigade are a resounding slap in the face to Sholokhov!

We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that: Socialism is the bright path! We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life, resolutely taking the happy path of socialism!

**The Communist Party is the Good Leader of the People**

Secretary of the Jianxinzhuang Party Branch, Lü Jiayan: In *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Davydov is portrayed as a representative of the working class, an embodiment of the Party, and a leader of the mass movement. However, Sholokhov defames him as a right-opportunist.

The village that Sholokhov writes about is filled with intense class struggle, where the enemy uses it as a base for counter-revolutionary riots, assassinating poor and lower-middle peasants, poisoning draft animals, and crazily sabotaging the agricultural collectivization movement. However, as the Party leader, Davydov not only does not mobilize the masses to fight against the enemy but also praises the counter-revolutionary rich peasant Yakov, saying he is a "scientific farmer" and that with someone like him, the collective farm's face can be changed in a year; and promotes Yakov to be the manager, handing over the management of the collective farm to him. Sholokhov portrays Davydov as a representative of the Communist Party, which is a gross slander of the Soviet Communist Party led by Stalin!

We have such villains in our village too. However, we do not beautify or trust them but firmly fight against them, allowing them to behave only if they follow the rules and not cause trouble. The power is in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and as soon as they cause trouble, we will expose them.

Old Communist Party member Bai Yushan: What kind of Communist Party member is Davydov? He enters the village, neither visits the poor nor asks about their hardships, but instead throws himself into the arms of the rich peasants. In 1952, when we were implementing collectivization, the Communist Party members sent by Chairman Mao, as soon as they entered the village, went to the poorest and most miserable families. At that time, we formed a small cooperative of sixteen households, and there were many difficulties at the beginning, but the Party gave us great support, sending us poor and lower-middle peasants to Party training classes to learn about collectivization. Without funds, the state provided loans; without feed, the government sent us bean cakes. Chairman Mao's support for our agricultural collectivization was so great! The Communist Party is our good leader. Without the Party's support, we would not be able to stand for a single day! However, as the Party leader, what attitude does Davydov have towards the eighteen households of poor and lower-middle peasants who actively organize to take the path of collectivization? He completely denies the poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for the socialist path, denies their correct direction, and says they are getting worse and worse. Davydov's behavior of pouring cold water on the poor and lower-middle peasants is not something a Communist Party member would do!

**Denying the Poor Peasants is Denying the Revolution**

Old poor peasant Li Jincai: In his poisonous weed *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Sholokhov turns a serious class struggle of the Soviet laboring people to eliminate the rich peasant class into a farce, portraying the Soviet laboring people with a glorious revolutionary tradition as clowns. The old poor peasant Shukar is defamed as a coward who fears death, a selfish and backward person with no spirit of a poor and lower-middle peasant. Sholokhov, shut your mouth, do not slander! The poor and lower-middle peasants around the world are one family. We are all revolutionary hard bones!

From the War of Resistance against Japan to today's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fighting the Japanese, struggling against landlords, carrying out rectification campaigns, building socialism, as long as Chairman Mao gives the order, which task have we poor and lower-middle peasants not taken the lead in? Which task have we not rushed to the front and fought bravely? In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants wore our heads in our belts to revolutionize, and we have never hesitated for a moment!

After liberation, the landlords and rich peasants were unwilling to accept their destruction and tried every means to harm us. Whenever there was a slight disturbance, they would stir up trouble. During the collectivization period, the struggle was intense, but we poor and lower-middle peasants firmly fought against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and there was not a single soft bone among us.

In socialist construction, we poor and lower-middle peasants are also at the forefront. Previously, this place was a vast alkaline land, but now it has been transformed into a vast rice field, all of which is the result of the hard work of our poor and lower-middle peasants. When we were transforming the land into rice fields, we were full of enthusiasm. We thought of drilling wells and digging canals for socialism and were not afraid of the cold and frost. On New Year's Day, even at minus twenty-four degrees, we did not rest, and we ate dumplings on the river and in the wells. Chairman Mao highly praises us poor and lower-middle peasants, saying we are the vanguard of the revolution. We have suffered the most in the old society and are the most resolute in taking the socialist path!

Revolutionary fighter Jiang Guangyu: Sholokhov portrays the rich middle peasants and counter-revolutionary rich peasants as the pillars of collectivization, which is completely turning black into white! Just take our village as an example. In the year of collectivization, as soon as our village's poor and lower-middle peasants heard that Chairman Mao called on us to take the path of collectivization, they were overjoyed. The poorest dozen or so households in our village, under the leadership of the Party, were the first to organize a small cooperative. At that time, we lacked farming tools, draft animals had no feed, and there was a lack of fertilizer, plus natural disasters, and there were many difficulties. However, our village's poor and lower-middle peasants stuck together, and without fertilizer, we dug river mud; without draft animals, we pulled the plows ourselves. Everyone worked together with one heart, unshakably, and not at all like what Sholokhov writes. But what about the middle peasants? Their attitude was hesitant, fearing they would lose out. They said: "Joining the cooperative? I still want to see." A few wealthy middle peasants even organized a black cooperative to compete with us poor and lower-middle peasants. They had carts, draft animals, and capital, wanting to outdo us. The village's rich peasants also sneered at us: "This group of poor guys will never amount to anything!" But what was the result? Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we persisted in self-reliance and worked hard. That year, although there was flooding, we still achieved an unprecedented good harvest. We poor guys really made it! Our cooperative quickly expanded from a dozen households to over fifty households and finally to the entire village, achieving full village collectivization. The enemy's plot to obstruct us from taking the socialist path was completely foiled!

Chairman Mao said well: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you are denying the revolution. If you attack them, you are attacking the revolution." Sholokhov's hatred for us poor and lower-middle peasants fully exposes his counter-revolutionary true colors.

**The Rich Peasants are the Deadly Enemies of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants**

Old poor peasant Yang Fuyu: Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, and there is no hate without reason." Sholokhov loves the landlords and rich peasants to death and hates the poor peasants to the bone. In his novel, on the one hand, he defames the poor and lower-middle peasants, and on the other hand, he tries every means to cover up the exploitative nature of the rich peasants and put makeup on them. He writes that every rich peasant is clever and capable, thrifty and hardworking. For example, that rich peasant Tishka, every day he is so busy that he doesn't even have time to shave his beard or change his clothes, working day and night until he becomes rich. This is simply lying with his eyes open! All crows are black, where are there landlords and rich peasants who do not exploit? Landlords and rich peasants are our deadly enemies. Landlords and rich peasants do not hire workers, and can they grab money with both hands? We poor and lower-middle peasants have two hardworking hands, so why do we suffer poverty all our lives? Take me as an example. From a young age, I worked for the landlords, and by the age of twenty, I still couldn't afford clothes for my head or shoes and socks for my feet. My two brothers, without dragging family or children, strong and healthy, but until liberation, we couldn't even afford a quilt! The landlord bosses, not stepping out of their big doors, not crossing their second doors, where do they get their food and drink? They all drink the blood of us poor and lower-middle peasants!

Tractor station worker Li Hongli: Sholokhov says that we poor and lower-middle peasants suffer because of fate and laziness. In the book, he writes about the old poor peasant Shukar, saying that his suffering is all because of geese chasing, horses kicking, cows butting, and dogs biting, without mentioning the rich peasants' cruel exploitation and oppression, which is extremely reactionary! Take my family as an example. My father was killed by the Japanese devils for guiding the Eighth Route Army, and my grandmother and elder brother died of anger and illness. At the age of eleven, I started working for the landlords, and even after dark, the landlords forced me to cut grass, resulting in my finger being cut off. The suffering of us poor and lower-middle peasants is the suffering of class exploitation and national oppression, and the fate of my family is the iron evidence! This hand of mine is the iron evidence!

Chairman Mao said: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to rise up many times to resist the landlord class's rule." Sholokhov erases the landlords' and rich peasants' exploitation and oppression, fearing that the poor and lower-middle peasants will rise up to rebel against the landlords and rich peasants.

**Sholokhov and Khrushchev Sing the Same Tune**

Revolutionary faction leader and tractor driver of Jinxing Brigade, Dong Lianhua: Sholokhov and Khrushchev wear the same pants and sing the same tune. Many things he advocates in his novel are Khrushchev's goods.

Khrushchev advocates "peaceful transition," "peaceful coexistence," and "peaceful competition," attempting to cancel out the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Sholokhov, through the mouths of the characters in his novel, curses Marx's theory of proletarian revolution. Marx said: "In this revolution, the proletariat loses only their chains. They will gain the whole world." Sholokhov, however, through the mouth of the old poor peasant Shukar, says: "As for the proletariat, I read in one place that they will lose nothing but chains. I certainly have no chains, except for the old chain that used to tie the dog."

Khrushchev advocates the "whole people's party" and "whole people's state," denying the existence of classes and class struggle in socialist society. Sholokhov, through Shukar's mouth, curses: "I want to walk in the village, and as soon as I encounter a dog, you have to be on guard. What do I need class struggle for?"

Khrushchev advocates "potato stew with beef" communism. Sholokhov, through Shukar's mouth, says: "The most important thing in the world is to eat. If there is nothing to eat, what use is the title of proletariat? In that case, I will immediately support the private ownership of livestock."

Sholokhov advocates all this, completely to meet the needs of imperialism, not wanting the proletariat to rise up in revolution.

All of this fully exposes his savage face of hating Marxism-Leninism and hating the revolutionary peoples of the world. Sholokhov is not only the enemy of the Soviet people but also the deadly enemy of the laboring people of the whole world!

    肖洛霍夫是世界劳动人民的死敌
    ——北京红星公社金星大队贫下中农怒斥大毒草《被开垦的处女地》
    《被开垦的处女地》是修正主义文艺鼻祖肖洛霍夫的代表作之一。在这部作品中，他美化阶级敌人，丑化贫下中农，恶毒攻击苏联三十年代的农业集体化运动，赤裸裸地暴露了他与劳动人民为敌的狰狞面目。
    北京红星公社金星大队的贫下中农，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，以自己在农业合作化运动中的切身体会，对《被开垦的处女地》进行了严厉的批判。
        社会主义是光明大道
    贫农社员王吉发：肖洛霍夫在大毒草《被开垦的处女地》中，把苏联伟大的农业集体化运动写得乌烟瘴气。在整个集体化的过程中，贫下中农宰家畜，抢谷种，打干部，开会睡大觉，干活磨洋工，压根儿没有走社会主义道路的积极性。特别叫人气愤的是，这本书的末尾这样写道：在凄凉的秋风里，一个悲伤绝望的老头子守着两个孤零零的荒坟。肖洛霍夫暗示，这就是农业集体化的下场。这简直是极大的污蔑！我们也是从农业集体化这条道上走过来的，实际情况根本不象肖洛霍夫描写的那样，农业集体化给我们带来的好处，那真是几天几夜也说不完！
    解放前，地主逼得我家破人亡。我妹妹是在旧社会饿死的。父亲带着我们一家三口从山东逃到北京附近，地主连村都不让进，我们只好又逃到张家口，在山洞里过了几年野人生活，差点被狼吃掉！
    平地一声春雷，毛主席领导我们推翻了地主阶级，我一家分得了土地。可是，因为那时是一家一户单干，无力抵御灾荒，我不得不又去给人扛活。毛主席说得好：“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。”毛主席的话照亮了我们的心坎，我们很快地组织起来，成立了互助组，合作社，以后又成立了人民公社。我们的生产越来越好，日子越过越兴旺。
    解放前，我们金星大队是个穷地方，好年景每亩能打七、八十斤粮食，一遇天灾就颗粒无收。解放后，我们按照毛主席的指示，坚决组织起来，走集体化的道路。一九五五年，毛主席他老人家亲自审查了我们合作化的远景规划，并向我们指出：“人类的发展有了几十万年，在中国这个地方，直到现在方才取得了按照计划发展自己的经济和文化的条件。自从取得了这个条件，我国的面目就将一年一年地起变化。”听了毛主席他老人家的话，我们浑身是劲。凭着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，我们夺得了一个又一个的大丰收。粮食由过去亩产七、八十斤提高到七、八百斤。这一切不都是集体化给我们带来的吗？农业集体化就是好得很！我们金星大队的巨大变化就是给肖洛霍夫的一记响亮耳光！
    我们贫下中农深深体会到：社会主义是光明大道！我们贫下中农要跟着毛主席，干一辈子革命，坚决走社会主义的幸福路！
                共产党是人民的好领导
    建新庄党支部书记吕家燕：《被开垦的处女地》中的达维多夫，是作为工人阶级的代表，党的化身，群众运动的“领袖”出现在小说中的。可是，肖洛霍夫却把他丑化成为一个右倾机会主义分子。
    肖洛霍夫写的那个村子，阶级斗争非常激烈，敌人把那儿当作反革命暴乱的据点，他们暗杀贫下中农，毒害耕牛，疯狂破坏农业集体化运动。但是作为党的领导的达维多夫，不仅不发动群众向敌人进行斗争，反而对进行破坏活动的反革命富农雅可夫大肆吹捧，说他是“科学化的农民”，有了他这样一个人，一年就可以改变集体农庄的面貌；并一手提拔雅可夫当经理，把集体农庄的经营管理大权完全交给了他。肖洛霍夫把达维多夫这样的人写成为共产党的代表，这是对以斯大林为首的苏联共产党的极大污蔑！
    象雅可夫这样的坏蛋，我们村也有。但是，我们对这种人不是美化和信任他，而是坚决和他斗争，只许他规规矩矩，不许他乱说乱动。政权掌握在咱贫下中农手里，只要他一捣乱，就把他揪住。
    老共产党员白玉善：达维多夫是什么共产党员？进了村，一不访贫，二不问苦，一头扎到富农怀里。一九五二年我们搞合作化时，毛主席派来的共产党员，一进村，那家最穷，最苦，就往那家走。当时我们搞了个十六户的小社，刚开始困难很多，但是党给了我们很大的支持，送我们贫下中农到党训班去学习，讲合作化的道理。没有资金，国家给贷款，没有饲料，政府给送来豆饼。毛主席对我们农业合作化是多么支持啊！共产党是咱们人民的好领导。要是没有党的支持，我们真是一天也立不住！可是，达维多夫作为党的领导，对十八户积极组织起来走集体化道路的贫下中农是什么态度呢？他根本否认贫下中农走社会主义道路的积极性，否认他们的大方向，说他们越搞越糟。达维多夫这种给贫下中农泼冷水的行为，哪里象共产党员干的事呢？
              否认贫农，便是否认革命
    老贫农李金才：肖洛霍夫在他的大毒草《被开垦的处女地》中，把一场苏联劳动人民消灭富农阶级的严肃的阶级斗争写成了滑稽剧，把具有光荣革命斗争传统的苏联劳动人民写成了小丑。老贫农舒卡尔被他丑化为贪生怕死的胆小鬼，自私自利的老落后，没有一点贫下中农的骨气。肖洛霍夫，闭住你的嘴，不许你污蔑！天下贫下中农是一家。我们都是革命的硬骨头！
    从抗日战争到今天的无产阶级文化大革命，打日本，斗地主，搞肃反，干社会主义，只要毛主席一声令下，咱贫下中农哪一样不是打头阵？哪一样不是冲在前，杀在先的？过去，我们贫下中农脑袋掖在腰带上干革命，从来没有含糊过半点！
    解放以后，地主富农不甘心自己的灭亡，千方百计地暗算我们，碰到个风吹草动，他们就蠢蠢欲动。合作化时期，斗争很激烈，可我们贫下中农硬是和地、富、反、坏斗，没有一个软骨头。
    在社会主义建设中，我们贫下中农也是一马当先。从前我们这儿是一片盐碱地，现在改成了一色的水稻田，这不全是我们贫下中农的一双手干出来的吗？改稻地那阵，我们真是干劲冲天。我们想着为社会主义打井挖渠，就不怕天寒地冻，零下二十四度的天，连大年初一也没歇工，饺子是在河上、井下吃的。毛主席他老人家对我们贫下中农评价最高，说我们是革命的先锋。我们在旧社会受苦最深，走社会主义道路最坚决！
    革命派战士蒋光宇：肖洛霍夫把富裕中农、反革命富农写成集体化的台柱子，这完全是颠倒黑白！就拿我们村来说，合作化那年，咱村的贫下中农一听说毛主席他老人家号召咱们走集体化道路，高兴极了，咱村最穷的十多户贫下中农在党的领导下，最先组织了一个小社。当时我们农具不足，牲口没有饲料，又缺肥，再加上天灾，困难很多。但是咱村的贫下中农紧抱成一团，没有肥，我们挖河泥，缺牲口，我们人拉犁，大家齐心合力，毫不动摇，根本不象肖洛霍夫写的那个样子。可是中农呢，他们的态度是犹豫的，他们怕吃亏。他们说：“入社嘛，我还要看看。”有几户富裕中农还组织了一个黑社和我们贫下中农唱对台戏。他们有车有牲口，又有资金，想把我们比垮。村里的富农还恶狠狠地讥笑我们：“这群穷小子成不了气候！”但是结果怎么样呢？我们在毛主席的领导下，坚持自力更生，穷干苦干。这一年，虽然天涝，我们却获得了从未有过的好收成。我们穷小子真的成了气候，鸡毛硬是飞上了天！我们的社迅速由十几户发展到五十多户，最后扩大到全村，实现了全村合作化。阶级敌人想阻挡我们走社会主义道路的阴谋彻底破产了！
    毛主席他老人家说得好：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”肖洛霍夫那么仇视我们贫下中农，完全暴露了他反革命的真面目。
                富农是贫下中农的死对头
    老贫农杨福玉：毛主席他老人家教导我们：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”肖洛霍夫爱地富爱得要命，恨贫农恨得入骨。他在小说中一方面把贫下中农丑化得一塌糊涂，另一方面却千方百计地掩盖富农的剥削本质，替富农涂脂抹粉。他写的富农个个都是精明能干，勤俭起家。比如那个富农铁推克，整天忙得胡子顾不得刮，衣服也顾不上换，白天黑夜地干活，才发起家来。这简直是睁着眼说瞎话！天下乌鸦一般黑，哪有不剥削的地主、富农？地主、富农是咱们贫下中农的死对头。地主、富农不雇工，就能两手抓了钱来？我们贫下中农有两只爱劳动的手，怎么一辈子受穷？拿我来说吧，从小给地主扛活，到二十岁上，还上头穿不上褂子，下头穿不上鞋子袜子。我哥俩不拖家不带口，身强力壮，可直到解放，连床被都弄不起！地主老财大门不出，二门不迈，哪来的吃喝？他们喝的全是咱贫下中农的血呀！
    拖拉机站锻工李洪利：肖洛霍夫说我们贫下中农受穷是因为天生命苦，好吃懒做。他在书里写那个老贫农舒卡尔，说他受苦都是因为鹅追，马踢，牛顶，狗咬，根本不提富农残酷的剥削和压迫，真是反动透顶！拿我们家来说，我父亲因为给八路军带路，被日本鬼子活活打死，奶奶和大爷又气又急，接着也病死了。我十一岁上就给地主扛小活，天黑了，地主还逼我铡草，结果把手指头铡断了。我们贫下中农受的苦是阶级剥削苦和民族压迫苦，我们一家的遭遇就是铁证！我这只手就是铁证！
    毛主席说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”肖洛霍夫把地主富农的剥削、压迫一笔勾销，就是怕贫下中农起来造地主、富农的反。
                  肖洛霍夫和赫鲁晓夫一个腔调
    金星大队革命派负责人、拖拉机驾驶员董连华：肖洛霍夫和赫鲁晓夫，穿的是一条裤子，唱的是一个调子，他在小说里宣扬的许多东西，都是赫鲁晓夫的货色。
    赫鲁晓夫说要“和平过渡”，“和平共处”，“和平竞赛”，妄图取消各国人民的革命斗争，肖洛霍夫就通过他小说里人物的嘴咒骂马克思关于无产阶级革命的学说。马克思说：“无产者在这个革命中失去的只是锁链。他们获得的将是整个世界。”肖洛霍夫却通过老贫农舒卡尔的嘴说：“说到无产阶级，那我在一个地方读到过，除了链子以外，什么也不会失掉。我当然什么链子也没有，除了从前拴狗的那条旧链子以外。”
    赫鲁晓夫宣扬“全民党”，“全民国家”，否认社会主义社会存在阶级和阶级斗争，肖洛霍夫就借舒卡尔的嘴骂：“我要在村里走，只要碰到一只狗，你就得提心吊胆，我要他妈的阶级斗争干什么？”
    赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“土豆烧牛肉”的“共产主义”，肖洛霍夫又借舒卡尔的嘴说：“世界上最重要的就是吃，要是没有吃的，无产阶级的称号还有什么用处？那样的话，我一下子又会拥护牲口私有制的。”
    肖洛霍夫宣扬这一套，完全是为了适应帝国主义的需要，不要无产阶级起来革命。
    这一切充分暴露了他仇视马克思列宁主义、仇视世界革命人民的狰狞面目。肖洛霍夫不仅是苏联人民的敌人，也是全世界劳动人民的死敌！
