**Sholokhov is the Enemy of the World's Laboring People**

**--- Beijing Hongxing Commune Jinxing Brigade Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants Criticize the Poisonous Weed "Virgin Soil Upturned"**

*"Virgin Soil Upturned"* is one of the representative works of the father of revisionist literature, Sholokhov. In this work, he beautifies the class enemies, defames the poor and lower-middle peasants, and viciously attacks the Soviet Union's agricultural collectivization movement of the 1930s, fully exposing his hostile face towards the laboring people.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the Jinxing Brigade of Beijing Hongxing Commune, holding high the banner of criticizing revisionism with Mao Zedong Thought, have severely criticized *"Virgin Soil Upturned"* based on their own experiences in the agricultural collectivization movement.

**Socialism is the Bright Path**

Poor peasant member Wang Jifa: In the poisonous weed *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Sholokhov depicts the great Soviet agricultural collectivization movement as chaotic and disorganized. Throughout the entire collectivization process, the poor and lower-middle peasants slaughtered livestock, stole seeds, beat cadres, slept during meetings, and worked slowly, showing no enthusiasm for the socialist path. What is particularly infuriating is that the book ends with this sentence: "In the desolate autumn wind, an old man, sad and desperate, guards two lonely graves." Sholokhov implies that this is the outcome of agricultural collectivization. This is a gross slander! We too have walked the path of agricultural collectivization, and the actual situation is not at all like what Sholokhov describes. The benefits that agricultural collectivization has brought us are countless!

Before liberation, the landlords drove my family to ruin. My sister starved to death in the old society. My father, with our family of three, fled from Shandong to the outskirts of Beijing, but the landlords wouldn't even let us into the village. We had to flee again to Zhangjiakou, living in caves like wild animals for a few years, almost being eaten by wolves!

A thunderclap of spring, Chairman Mao led us to overthrow the landlord class, and our family received land. However, because at that time we were farming individually, we were powerless against natural disasters, and I had to go work for others. Chairman Mao said well: "The vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty, improve their lives, and resist natural disasters, have no choice but to unite and advance towards the socialist path to achieve their goals." Chairman Mao's words illuminated our hearts, and we quickly organized ourselves, forming mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and later people's communes. Our production improved year by year, and our lives became more prosperous.

Before liberation, our Jinxing Brigade was a poor place. In good years, each mu of land could yield seventy or eighty jin of grain, but during natural disasters, there would be nothing left. After liberation, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions and resolutely organized ourselves to take the path of collectivization. In 1955, Chairman Mao personally reviewed our cooperative plan and pointed out to us: "Human development has spanned tens of thousands of years, but it is only now in this place in China that we have obtained the conditions to develop our economy and culture according to a plan. Since obtaining these conditions, the face of our country will change year by year." Hearing Chairman Mao's words, we were full of energy. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, we achieved one bumper harvest after another. Grain yield increased from seventy or eighty jin per mu to seven or eight hundred jin. All of this is thanks to collectivization! The great changes in our Jinxing Brigade are a resounding slap in the face to Sholokhov!

We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply feel that: Socialism is the bright path! We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao and revolutionize for life, resolutely taking the happy path of socialism!

**The Communist Party is the Good Leader of the People**

Secretary of the Jianxinzhuang Party Branch, LÃ¼ Jiayan: In *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Davydov is portrayed as a representative of the working class, an embodiment of the Party, and a leader of the mass movement. However, Sholokhov defames him as a right-opportunist.

The village that Sholokhov writes about is filled with intense class struggle, where the enemy uses it as a base for counter-revolutionary riots, assassinating poor and lower-middle peasants, poisoning draft animals, and crazily sabotaging the agricultural collectivization movement. However, as the Party leader, Davydov not only does not mobilize the masses to fight against the enemy but also praises the counter-revolutionary rich peasant Yakov, saying he is a "scientific farmer" and that with someone like him, the collective farm's face can be changed in a year; and promotes Yakov to be the manager, handing over the management of the collective farm to him. Sholokhov portrays Davydov as a representative of the Communist Party, which is a gross slander of the Soviet Communist Party led by Stalin!

We have such villains in our village too. However, we do not beautify or trust them but firmly fight against them, allowing them to behave only if they follow the rules and not cause trouble. The power is in the hands of us poor and lower-middle peasants, and as soon as they cause trouble, we will expose them.

Old Communist Party member Bai Yushan: What kind of Communist Party member is Davydov? He enters the village, neither visits the poor nor asks about their hardships, but instead throws himself into the arms of the rich peasants. In 1952, when we were implementing collectivization, the Communist Party members sent by Chairman Mao, as soon as they entered the village, went to the poorest and most miserable families. At that time, we formed a small cooperative of sixteen households, and there were many difficulties at the beginning, but the Party gave us great support, sending us poor and lower-middle peasants to Party training classes to learn about collectivization. Without funds, the state provided loans; without feed, the government sent us bean cakes. Chairman Mao's support for our agricultural collectivization was so great! The Communist Party is our good leader. Without the Party's support, we would not be able to stand for a single day! However, as the Party leader, what attitude does Davydov have towards the eighteen households of poor and lower-middle peasants who actively organize to take the path of collectivization? He completely denies the poor and lower-middle peasants' enthusiasm for the socialist path, denies their correct direction, and says they are getting worse and worse. Davydov's behavior of pouring cold water on the poor and lower-middle peasants is not something a Communist Party member would do!

**Denying the Poor Peasants is Denying the Revolution**

Old poor peasant Li Jincai: In his poisonous weed *"Virgin Soil Upturned"*, Sholokhov turns a serious class struggle of the Soviet laboring people to eliminate the rich peasant class into a farce, portraying the Soviet laboring people with a glorious revolutionary tradition as clowns. The old poor peasant Shukar is defamed as a coward who fears death, a selfish and backward person with no spirit of a poor and lower-middle peasant. Sholokhov, shut your mouth, do not slander! The poor and lower-middle peasants around the world are one family. We are all revolutionary hard bones!

From the War of Resistance against Japan to today's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fighting the Japanese, struggling against landlords, carrying out rectification campaigns, building socialism, as long as Chairman Mao gives the order, which task have we poor and lower-middle peasants not taken the lead in? Which task have we not rushed to the front and fought bravely? In the past, we poor and lower-middle peasants wore our heads in our belts to revolutionize, and we have never hesitated for a moment!

After liberation, the landlords and rich peasants were unwilling to accept their destruction and tried every means to harm us. Whenever there was a slight disturbance, they would stir up trouble. During the collectivization period, the struggle was intense, but we poor and lower-middle peasants firmly fought against the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, and there was not a single soft bone among us.

In socialist construction, we poor and lower-middle peasants are also at the forefront. Previously, this place was a vast alkaline land, but now it has been transformed into a vast rice field, all of which is the result of the hard work of our poor and lower-middle peasants. When we were transforming the land into rice fields, we were full of enthusiasm. We thought of drilling wells and digging canals for socialism and were not afraid of the cold and frost. On New Year's Day, even at minus twenty-four degrees, we did not rest, and we ate dumplings on the river and in the wells. Chairman Mao highly praises us poor and lower-middle peasants, saying we are the vanguard of the revolution. We have suffered the most in the old society and are the most resolute in taking the socialist path!

Revolutionary fighter Jiang Guangyu: Sholokhov portrays the rich middle peasants and counter-revolutionary rich peasants as the pillars of collectivization, which is completely turning black into white! Just take our village as an example. In the year of collectivization, as soon as our village's poor and lower-middle peasants heard that Chairman Mao called on us to take the path of collectivization, they were overjoyed. The poorest dozen or so households in our village, under the leadership of the Party, were the first to organize a small cooperative. At that time, we lacked farming tools, draft animals had no feed, and there was a lack of fertilizer, plus natural disasters, and there were many difficulties. However, our village's poor and lower-middle peasants stuck together, and without fertilizer, we dug river mud; without draft animals, we pulled the plows ourselves. Everyone worked together with one heart, unshakably, and not at all like what Sholokhov writes. But what about the middle peasants? Their attitude was hesitant, fearing they would lose out. They said: "Joining the cooperative? I still want to see." A few wealthy middle peasants even organized a black cooperative to compete with us poor and lower-middle peasants. They had carts, draft animals, and capital, wanting to outdo us. The village's rich peasants also sneered at us: "This group of poor guys will never amount to anything!" But what was the result? Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we persisted in self-reliance and worked hard. That year, although there was flooding, we still achieved an unprecedented good harvest. We poor guys really made it! Our cooperative quickly expanded from a dozen households to over fifty households and finally to the entire village, achieving full village collectivization. The enemy's plot to obstruct us from taking the socialist path was completely foiled!

Chairman Mao said well: "Without the poor peasants, there would be no revolution. If you deny them, you are denying the revolution. If you attack them, you are attacking the revolution." Sholokhov's hatred for us poor and lower-middle peasants fully exposes his counter-revolutionary true colors.

**The Rich Peasants are the Deadly Enemies of the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants**

Old poor peasant Yang Fuyu: Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the world, there is no love without reason, and there is no hate without reason." Sholokhov loves the landlords and rich peasants to death and hates the poor peasants to the bone. In his novel, on the one hand, he defames the poor and lower-middle peasants, and on the other hand, he tries every means to cover up the exploitative nature of the rich peasants and put makeup on them. He writes that every rich peasant is clever and capable, thrifty and hardworking. For example, that rich peasant Tishka, every day he is so busy that he doesn't even have time to shave his beard or change his clothes, working day and night until he becomes rich. This is simply lying with his eyes open! All crows are black, where are there landlords and rich peasants who do not exploit? Landlords and rich peasants are our deadly enemies. Landlords and rich peasants do not hire workers, and can they grab money with both hands? We poor and lower-middle peasants have two hardworking hands, so why do we suffer poverty all our lives? Take me as an example. From a young age, I worked for the landlords, and by the age of twenty, I still couldn't afford clothes for my head or shoes and socks for my feet. My two brothers, without dragging family or children, strong and healthy, but until liberation, we couldn't even afford a quilt! The landlord bosses, not stepping out of their big doors, not crossing their second doors, where do they get their food and drink? They all drink the blood of us poor and lower-middle peasants!

Tractor station worker Li Hongli: Sholokhov says that we poor and lower-middle peasants suffer because of fate and laziness. In the book, he writes about the old poor peasant Shukar, saying that his suffering is all because of geese chasing, horses kicking, cows butting, and dogs biting, without mentioning the rich peasants' cruel exploitation and oppression, which is extremely reactionary! Take my family as an example. My father was killed by the Japanese devils for guiding the Eighth Route Army, and my grandmother and elder brother died of anger and illness. At the age of eleven, I started working for the landlords, and even after dark, the landlords forced me to cut grass, resulting in my finger being cut off. The suffering of us poor and lower-middle peasants is the suffering of class exploitation and national oppression, and the fate of my family is the iron evidence! This hand of mine is the iron evidence!

Chairman Mao said: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants forced the peasants to rise up many times to resist the landlord class's rule." Sholokhov erases the landlords' and rich peasants' exploitation and oppression, fearing that the poor and lower-middle peasants will rise up to rebel against the landlords and rich peasants.

**Sholokhov and Khrushchev Sing the Same Tune**

Revolutionary faction leader and tractor driver of Jinxing Brigade, Dong Lianhua: Sholokhov and Khrushchev wear the same pants and sing the same tune. Many things he advocates in his novel are Khrushchev's goods.

Khrushchev advocates "peaceful transition," "peaceful coexistence," and "peaceful competition," attempting to cancel out the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. Sholokhov, through the mouths of the characters in his novel, curses Marx's theory of proletarian revolution. Marx said: "In this revolution, the proletariat loses only their chains. They will gain the whole world." Sholokhov, however, through the mouth of the old poor peasant Shukar, says: "As for the proletariat, I read in one place that they will lose nothing but chains. I certainly have no chains, except for the old chain that used to tie the dog."

Khrushchev advocates the "whole people's party" and "whole people's state," denying the existence of classes and class struggle in socialist society. Sholokhov, through Shukar's mouth, curses: "I want to walk in the village, and as soon as I encounter a dog, you have to be on guard. What do I need class struggle for?"

Khrushchev advocates "potato stew with beef" communism. Sholokhov, through Shukar's mouth, says: "The most important thing in the world is to eat. If there is nothing to eat, what use is the title of proletariat? In that case, I will immediately support the private ownership of livestock."

Sholokhov advocates all this, completely to meet the needs of imperialism, not wanting the proletariat to rise up in revolution.

All of this fully exposes his savage face of hating Marxism-Leninism and hating the revolutionary peoples of the world. Sholokhov is not only the enemy of the Soviet people but also the deadly enemy of the laboring people of the whole world!
