On November 14th, we, the most revered great leader and the red sun in the hearts of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, received us. Chairman Mao is in such good health, and his energy is so abundant. This is the greatest happiness for all the people of China, and it is the greatest happiness for all revolutionary people around the world. We sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long, long life! Long, long life!!

I was born into an ordinary worker's family and suffered greatly under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries in the old society. It was Chairman Mao who liberated us from this sea of suffering. From the day I began to understand things, I have longed to see Chairman Mao. Seeing Chairman Mao has been my greatest wish in life.

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we followed Chairman Mao's instructions: "You must pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" We actively participated in this cultural revolution. To defend Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we engaged in a life-and-death struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party, headed by China's Khrushchev. During the days when the reactionary bourgeois line ruled, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought inspired us to fight and strive for victory. In the most difficult days of struggle, we constantly thought of Chairman Mao, and some comrades wrote in their own blood on the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" their oath to be forever loyal to Chairman Mao. We firmly believe that Chairman Mao's revolutionary line will definitely win, and following Chairman Mao in revolution will definitely win.

Today, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victory. On this day, Chairman Mao received us, how can this not make us excited! How can we not shout a thousand times, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live!" This is the greatest happiness in our lives, this is the greatest encouragement and the greatest motivation for us. Chairman Mao receiving us makes us even more confident and powerful! We pledge to Chairman Mao: to live to bravely fight for Mao Zedong Thought, to die to gloriously sacrifice for Mao Zedong Thought. To defend Chairman Mao, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we will fearlessly climb mountains of knives and walk through fires. We will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works better, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    跟着毛主席干革命最光荣
    湖北黄石红联总赴京代表　方军
    十一月十四日，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖、世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席接见了我们。毛主席他老人家身体是那样健康，精力是那样充沛，这是我们全中国人民最大的幸福，是全世界革命人民最大的幸福，让我们衷心祝愿毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！！
    我出生在一个普通的工人家庭里，在吃人的旧社会受尽了国民党反动派的压迫，是毛主席他老人家把我们从苦海中解放出来。从我开始懂事的那天起，我就盼望什么时候能见到毛主席，我把能见到毛主席作为自己一生中最大的愿望。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们遵照毛主席“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”的教导，积极投入到这场文化大革命中。为了保卫毛主席，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，我们同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资派展开了生死大搏斗。在资产阶级反动路线统治的日子里，战无不胜的毛泽东思想鼓舞着我们去斗争，去争取胜利。在斗争最艰苦的日子里，我们日夜想念毛主席，有的同志用自己的鲜血在《毛主席语录》上写下了永远忠于毛主席的誓言。我们坚信毛主席的革命路线一定要胜利，紧跟毛主席干革命就一定能胜利。
    今天，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利。在这样的日子里，毛主席接见了我们，这怎么能不令人激动！这怎么能不令人千万遍地高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”这是我们一生中最大最大的幸福，这是对我们最大最大的鼓励和最大最大的鞭策。毛主席接见我们，使我们更充满了信心和力量！我们向毛主席宣誓：生为捍卫毛泽东思想而英勇战斗，死为捍卫毛泽东思想而光荣献身。为保卫毛主席、保卫毛泽东思想、保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，上刀山、下火海也在所不惜。我们一定要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
