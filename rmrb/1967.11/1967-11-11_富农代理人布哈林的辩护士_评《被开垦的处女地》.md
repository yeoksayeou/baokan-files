The late 1920s to the early 1930s saw the Soviet people, under the leadership of the great Marxist-Leninist Stalin, launch a magnificent agricultural collectivization movement. This movement was not only a great economic revolution but, more importantly, a great political revolution to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and develop the socialist system.

Revolution inevitably encounters resistance. The great teacher Chairman Mao taught us: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, was a serious struggle of thought and politics."

The situation in the Soviet Union was exactly like this. The agricultural collectivization movement led by Stalin was met with fierce opposition and sabotage from the old opportunist, the kulak agent Bukharin, right from the start. Bukharin and his ilk fiercely opposed the elimination of the kulaks and pushed the right-opportunist line, attempting to lead the Soviet Union down the capitalist road.

Stalin exposed the conspiracy of the Bukharin anti-party clique and led the entire party to smash their arrogant attacks, firmly adhering to the proletarian revolutionary line of fully developing agricultural collectivization and eliminating the kulak economy.

The struggle between Stalin and Bukharin was a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. Where did Sholokhov stand in this struggle? What role did he play? He stood on Bukharin's side, opposing Stalin, opposing socialism, and opposing the proletarian revolutionary line. He threw out the poisonous weed "Virgin Soil Upturned," playing the shameful role of Bukharin's advocate.

Who should rely on for the socialist transformation of agriculture?

The socialist transformation of agriculture must rely on the poor peasants.

Stalin pointed out during the struggle against the Bukharin clique: "The poor peasants are the pillars of the working class, the middle peasants are allies, and the kulaks are class enemies."

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out succinctly that for the socialist transformation of agriculture, "one must rely on the broad masses of poor peasants who were formerly semi-proletarian," and "one must establish the predominance of the present poor peasants and new lower-middle peasants in the leading organs."

Bukharin completely denied this. He believed that whether kulaks, middle peasants, or poor peasants, they were all the same "poor people." This way, he denied the existence of classes in the countryside, denied the socialist initiative of the poor peasants, and denied the proletarian revolutionary line that collectivization must rely on the poor peasants. Not only that, but Bukharin also used the fallacy that limiting the kulaks would "scare away" the middle peasants to threaten the party, saying that collectivization must rely on the kulaks.

Sholokhov faithfully propagated Bukharin's theory of denying the poor peasants. In "Virgin Soil Upturned," he distorted the poor peasants into a group of people without class consciousness, without socialist initiative, selfish, backward, ignorant, and uneducated mobs. Just look at how he vilified the old poor peasant Shukar to see one example.

As soon as Shukar appeared, Sholokhov made him look ridiculous—wearing a "woman's white sheepskin coat." Then he piled all the bad qualities of superstition, backwardness, selfishness, laziness, boasting, and the desire to get rich onto Shukar. He was superstitious about "fate," and a small "inauspicious" thing could make him tremble with fear; he boasted all day, "born with such a character, he couldn't live without boasting and lying"; whether herding horses, tending sheep, or driving a cart, he always dozed off; he pursued a meal of "three and a half pounds of mutton"; he wanted to be an actor to "make big money," wanted to join the party to "carry a briefcase and walk around"; his philosophy of life was that "the most important thing in life is to eat" ... Shukar, as depicted by Sholokhov, was such a monster!

The poor peasants supported collectivization with great socialist initiative because they were exploited and oppressed, suffering deeply. Yet Sholokhov absurdly wrote a long passage about Shukar's memories of the old society, claiming that Shukar suffered not class oppression but "animal suffering." Look! Shukar's suffering in the old society was being bitten by dogs, pecked by geese, frightened by eagles, rammed by wild boars, kicked unconscious by foals, and even chased by weasels. He suffered all kinds of "hardships" but never experienced class oppression! Sholokhov completely denied the class status of the poor peasants as exploited and oppressed, denied the class roots of the poor peasants' socialist initiative, and denied the class policy of relying on the poor peasants to establish collective farms!

Even more vilely, Sholokhov used the collapse of a collective farming community in Gneymyatskaya village, composed of "eighteen impoverished poor peasants," to prove that the poor peasants were "unreliable." The collective farming community was the bud of collective farms, indicating the poor peasants' great socialist initiative. Yet Sholokhov, through the mouths of party branch secretary Lagulov and others, cursed the collective farming community as "like a scabby calf, always drinking the milk of the Soviet power but never growing," "the more it is managed, the worse it gets ... in a word, it is of no use, only causes losses!"

Listen to these nonsense words, whose class voice is it?

Sholokhov painstakingly wrote a long passage, concluding with Bukharin's line: the poor peasants cannot be relied on, otherwise collectivization will "get worse and worse"!

Then who should rely on? Sholokhov and Bukharin sang the same tune: rely on the kulaks and the middle peasants.

Sholokhov depicted the kulaks as more beautiful than angels. He not only did not expose the essence of the kulaks' cruel exploitation but also extolled that the kulaks were originally "without anything," and they became rich because they were diligent and capable. Sholokhov also praised the kulaks Yakov Lozgin and Kidoch as evidence, saying that because they "worked day and night, didn't have time to comb their hair or beard, wore coarse trousers in winter and summer," and "worked so hard they got hernia," they became kulaks. Sholokhov sang high praises for the kulaks! He truly understood and mastered Bukharin's theory of "getting rich through labor."

In Sholokhov's depiction, the kulaks not only did not exploit but loved to work and could serve socialism. The kulak Yakov Lozgin worked hard to open up virgin land, providing "good seeds" for the Soviets, receiving "certificates, awards, and money" and the title of "advanced farmer."

The district committee secretary openly declared that striking the kulaks would "make a mess," "hit your head and bleed," "the masses would not trust us," the middle peasants would not join the collective farms, and the collective farms would not be well-managed. This was pure Bukharin's viewpoint. Davydov and the village Soviet chairman Razmitylov admired the kulak member Yakov so much that under their "strong advocacy," Yakov became the manager, holding the reins of the collective farm management. Davydov praised him endlessly, saying Yakov was a "manager who could turn the kopecks of the collective farm into rubles" and "no matter what, we must not lose this manager"! He even said, "with such a person, in just one year, we can change the face of the countryside"! Relying on the kulaks to change the face of the countryside, this was the conclusion of "little Bukharin"—Davydov.

Regarding the middle peasants, Sholokhov's beloved protagonist Davydov was completely in tune with Bukharin. After cursing the poor peasants' collective farming community, he followed the middle peasants. He found no one to rely on among the poor peasants, but the rich middle peasant Metanikov, like Yakov, became his confidant and the backbone of his collective farm. The poor peasants in the book were all lazy and idle, "only Metanikov worked like an ox." He also helped Davydov with advice, arranged production, and worked day and night for the collective farm ... No wonder Davydov said "especially thank Metanikov" and wanted to choose him as his successor. Indeed, later Metanikov joined the party and took over Davydov's position, becoming the chairman of the collective farm!

Chairman Mao taught us as early as 1927: "Without the poor peasants, there is no revolution. If you deny them, you deny the revolution. If you strike them, you strike the revolution." The facts have proven: the poor peasants are the revolutionary class in the countryside, and they are most willing to take the socialist road. Without relying on the poor peasants, production cannot develop, the middle peasants cannot be united, the socialist transformation cannot be completed, and the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated. The experience of the Soviet Union itself completely proves this point.

The middle peasants are a wavering class. As laborers, they lean towards the working class; as small private owners, they lean towards the kulaks. If the poor peasants are not relied upon to unite the middle peasants, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably intensify, and the socialist transformation will become empty talk. The "little Bukharin" Davydov in "Virgin Soil Upturned" created a collective farm where the kulaks were managers and the middle peasants were the backbone. Could such a "collective farm" take the socialist road? Such a "collective farm" is white and fake, a picture of restoring capitalism drawn by Sholokhov according to his counter-revolutionary ideals.

Is collectivization a smooth road or endless disaster?

Bukharin hated socialism and the agricultural collectivization movement. He spread alarmist rumors that developing collective farms would destroy the worker-peasant alliance, attacking the kulaks would leave the country without grain, and would cause public discontent ... In short, he portrayed agricultural collectivization as a monster that would destroy everything.

The master sets the tune, the servant sings along. Sholokhov picked up Bukharin's words and shot a barrage of poisonous arrows at agricultural collectivization. In the second part of the novel published after Stalin's death, it was filled with his vicious curses against collectivization. He completely erased the great achievements of the collectivization movement led by Stalin, eagerly summoned the spirit of Bukharin, and sang high praises for Khrushchev's restoration of capitalism.

Whether collectivization is a smooth road or endless disaster is a major issue that must be debated clearly.

Chairman Mao taught us: the majority of peasants "to get rid of poverty, improve their lives, and resist disasters, they must unite and move forward on the socialist road to achieve their goals."

Stalin pointed out: "Only collective farms can free the peasants from poverty and ignorance."

The peasants of the Stalin era in the Soviet Union relied on agricultural collectivization to transform individual economies, free themselves from poverty, and take the socialist smooth road.

Yet Sholokhov screamed that the "tune of collectivization has been sung to the point of making everyone cry." In his depiction, as soon as the collective farm was established, disasters accompanied collectivization to the village of Gneymyatskaya.

With great difficulty, the collective farm was established, but as soon as there was a slight disturbance, the members became chaotic. A rumor about the public ownership of small livestock caused the collective farm to lose "half of the horned livestock in two nights," and there was a big slaughter and feast. Collective farms schemed against each other, fought over land, fought over hay, and fought until they were bloodied. When other farms came to transport seeds, a wind of plundering grain immediately arose, and the collective farm's grain was plundered clean ... Even more vilely, Sholokhov, through the mouths of the poor peasants Shukar and his wife, cursed the collective farm as "living in chaos, incomprehensible, upside down," "the warehouse was empty except for mice, and even the mice were about to starve," "people's stomachs were about to stick to their backs." Every word dripped with Sholokhov's deep hatred for collectivization!

The facts were not like this. The vast majority of Soviet peasants firmly supported Stalin's call and resolutely took the road of agricultural collectivization. After establishing collective farms, the long-suppressed enthusiasm of the peasants erupted like a volcano. They launched socialist labor competitions, providing a large amount of grain for the Soviets, and smashed the kulaks' plot to starve the Soviets to death! Their lives improved day by day, and their spiritual outlook was completely renewed. Did Sholokhov not see these facts? No, the counter-revolutionary nature made him lie with his eyes open!

In the final part of the novel, Sholokhov's attacks on collectivization reached their peak. The novel was written from spring sowing to the end of autumn harvest. What fruits did the village of Gneymyatskaya harvest in autumn after sowing the seeds of collectivization in spring?

The autumn collective farm presented to people by Sholokhov was a desolate, miserable, and gloomy dark world: misfortunes in the farm increased, and in just one day, there were deaths, rare cases of women giving birth, and goats falling into wells and drowning. Then, Lagulov and Davydov were killed by the White Guards. Davydov's fiancée cried and returned to the village, and even the boastful Shukar became "obviously weaker" and "reclusive and silent," sighing, crossing himself, and crying all night in the cemetery. "The nights became longer and darker," and "from the pitch-black sky, the cries of cranes echoed, geese called to each other in sorrow, geese called in restraint, and ducks flapped their wings." The village of Gneymyatskaya in Sholokhov's depiction became a terrifying, dark hell. Here, there was no victory of collectivization, no joy of the people, no joy of harvest, and no superiority of socialism.

In Sholokhov's depiction, the village of Gneymyatskaya sowed the seeds of collectivization in spring and reaped endless disasters in autumn—deaths, departures, and dispersals, miserable and sorrowful. This was an insult to collectivization, an insult to Soviet peasants, and an insult to Stalin. However, the great achievements of the agricultural collectivization movement led by Stalin are indelible. Those who tamper with history will eventually be crushed by the wheels of history!

After Khrushchev came to power, Sholokhov jumped from Bukharin's flagpole into the arms of the Soviet revisionist leadership, becoming Khrushchev's trumpeter. In the second part of "Virgin Soil Upturned" published after Stalin's death, Sholokhov eagerly peddled Khrushchev's fake communism, all-people's state, all-people's party, and other revisionist garbage, cheering for the Soviet revisionist leadership's restoration of capitalism!

Now, the collective farms established in the Stalin era in the Soviet Union are in name only, and Soviet agriculture has taken the road of free operation and free competition of capitalism. The Soviet revisionist leadership implements the "profit-first" "new economic system," widely promotes "dividing land to teams" and "dividing land to households," expands private plots, opens free markets, and the spontaneous forces of capitalism develop maliciously. The polarization is becoming more and more serious, and the socialist economy has been completely destroyed. The "collective farms" of the Soviet revisionists have become the paradise of "red" millionaires, and the vast majority of Soviet peasants live a miserable life under the oppression and exploitation of the new tsars of the Soviet revisionists!

Dark clouds cannot last forever, and the red sun will surely shine again. The Soviet people will, under the guidance of the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, once again launch the great storm of the October Revolution, sweep away "Virgin Soil Upturned" and other various pieces of junk for restoring capitalism, overthrow the throne of the new tsars of the Soviet revisionists, and rebuild the brilliant socialist system. Listen! The voice of the great teacher Chairman Mao resonates through the universe: "The socialist system will inevitably replace the capitalist system. This is an objective law that does not change with people's will. No matter how the reactionaries try to prevent the forward march of the wheel of history, the revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will surely be victorious."

    富农代理人布哈林的辩护士
    ——评《被开垦的处女地》
    解放军某部五好战士　李庆
    二十年代末到三十年代初，苏联人民在伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林的领导下，掀起了波澜壮阔的农业集体化运动。这场运动不仅是伟大的经济革命，更重要的是一场巩固无产阶级专政、发展社会主义制度的伟大政治革命。
    要革命就会遇到阻力。伟大导师毛主席教导我们：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”
    苏联的情况正是这样。斯大林领导的农业集体化运动，一开始就遭到了老牌机会主义者、富农代理人布哈林的疯狂反对和破坏。布哈林之流拚命反对消灭富农，推行右倾机会主义路线，妄图把苏联引上资本主义道路。
    斯大林揭穿了布哈林反党集团的阴谋，并领导全党粉碎了他们的猖狂进攻，坚持了全力发展农业集体化和消灭富农经济的无产阶级革命路线。
    斯大林与布哈林的斗争，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。肖洛霍夫在这场斗争中，是站在哪一边呢？扮演了什么角色呢？他站在布哈林一边，反对斯大林，反对社会主义，反对无产阶级革命路线。他抛出了大毒草《被开垦的处女地》，扮演了布哈林的辩护士的可耻角色。
    农业社会主义改造依靠谁？
    农业社会主义改造必须也只有依靠贫农。
    斯大林在反布哈林集团时指出：“贫农是工人阶级的支柱，中农是同盟者，富农是阶级敌人”。
    伟大领袖毛主席精辟地指出，对农业实行社会主义改造“只有依靠过去是半无产阶级的广大的贫农群众”，“必须建立现有贫农和新下中农在领导机关中的优势”。
    布哈林完全否认这一点。他认为不管富农、中农、贫农，通通都是一样的“穷人”。这样就否认了农村中存在阶级，否认了贫农的社会主义积极性，否认了集体化必须依靠贫农的无产阶级革命路线。非但如此，布哈林还用限制富农会“吓跑”中农的谬论来威吓党，就是说，搞集体化还得依靠富农。
    肖洛霍夫忠实地宣扬了布哈林否认贫农的理论。在《被开垦的处女地》中，他把贫农歪曲为一群没有阶级觉悟，没有社会主义积极性，自私落后，愚昧无知的群氓。这里只要看看他对老贫农舒卡尔的丑化就可知其一斑。
    舒卡尔一出场，肖洛霍夫就叫他出丑——穿了一件“女式的白羊皮大衣”。然后就把迷信落后，自私愚昧，好吃懒做，专吹牛皮，盼望发财等等坏品质统统堆在舒卡尔头上。他迷信“命运”，一件“不吉利”的小事，就可以叫他心惊肉跳；他一天到晚吹牛，“天生成这样的性格，不吹牛不撒谎就过不了日子”；他不管养马放羊赶车都要打瞌睡，追求一顿吃“三斤半羊肉”；他想当演员“赚大钱”，想入党“夹上皮包走来走去”；他的处世哲学就是“人生在世最重要的就是吃”……肖洛霍夫笔下的老贫农舒卡尔就是这样一个丑怪！
    贫农所以拥护集体化，有巨大的社会主义积极性，根本原因就是他们受剥削，受压迫，苦大仇深。可是肖洛霍夫却荒谬绝伦地编写了一大段舒卡尔对旧社会的回忆，说明舒卡尔受的不是阶级苦，而是“动物苦”。看！舒卡尔在旧社会受的苦就是被狗咬过，被鹅啄过，给老鹰吓过，给野猪撞过，被马驹踢昏，甚至连黄鼠狼都追他。样样“苦”都吃过，就是没有受过阶级苦！肖洛霍夫根本否认了贫农受剥削受压迫的阶级地位，否认了贫农的社会主义积极性的阶级根源，否认了必须依靠贫农来办集体农庄的阶级政策！
    尤其恶毒的是，肖洛霍夫还拿格内米雅其村的一个由“十八户精光的贫农”组成的共耕社的“垮台”，来证明贫农“不可依靠”。共耕社是集体农庄的萌芽，表明了贫农有巨大的社会主义积极性。可是肖洛霍夫却借党支部书记拉古尔洛夫等人的嘴，痛骂共耕社“好象癞皮小牛，老吃苏维埃政权的奶，却总不见长大”，“越搞越糟……一句话，没有好处，只会亏本！”
    听听这些混帐话，是哪个阶级的声音？
    肖洛霍夫煞费苦心地写了一大篇，结论就是布哈林的一套：贫农不能依靠，否则集体化“越搞越糟”！
    那么依靠谁呢？肖洛霍夫同布哈林唱一个调调：一靠富农，二靠中农。
    肖洛霍夫把富农写得比天使还美。他不仅不揭露富农残酷剥削的本质，反而大肆宣扬富农原本也是“一无所有”，他们所以富是因为勤劳能干。肖洛霍夫还捧出富农雅可夫·洛济支和基多克为证，说因为他们“白天黑夜地干活，头发胡子都顾不得理，冬冬夏夏就穿一条粗布裤子”，还“累出小肠疝气”，才变成富农的。肖洛霍夫对富农的赞歌唱得多响！他对布哈林的“劳动发财”的富农理论真是心领神会，学到家了。
    肖洛霍夫笔下的富农非但不剥削，爱劳动，而且能为社会主义效劳。富农雅可夫·洛济支拚命开荒，为苏维埃“提供良种”，“得过奖状、奖金”和“先进农民”称号。
    小说里的区委书记公开宣称，打击富农就会“搞得一团糟”，“碰得头破血流”，“群众就会不信任我们”，中农就不肯加入集体农庄，集体农庄就办不好。这是十足的布哈林观点。达维多夫和村苏维埃主席拉兹米推洛夫对富农分子雅可夫也崇拜得五体投地，在他俩的“竭力主张”下，雅可夫当了经理，掌握了集体农庄管理大权。达维多夫对他赞不绝口，什么雅可夫是“能够把集体农庄的戈比变成卢布的经理”啦！“打定主意，无论如何不能失去这位经理”啦！甚至说“跟这样的人一起，只要一年就可以改变农村的面貌”啦！依靠富农改变农村面貌，这就是“小布哈林”——达维多夫的结论。
    对待中农，肖洛霍夫心爱的主人公达维多夫完全跟布哈林一个腔调。他把贫农的共耕社臭骂一顿后，就跟在中农屁股后面走。他在贫农中没找到一个可以依靠的对象，而富裕中农梅谭尼柯夫却和雅可夫一样，成了他的心腹，成了他办集体农庄的主心骨。书里的贫农都好吃懒做，“只有梅谭尼柯夫一个人象牛那样干”。他还帮达维多夫出主意，安排生产，日夜为集体农庄操心……难怪达维多夫说“特别要感谢梅谭尼柯夫”，要选他作接班人。果然，以后梅谭尼柯夫入了党，接替了达维多夫的遗任，当起集体农庄主席来了！
    毛主席早在一九二七年就教导我们：“没有贫农，便没有革命。若否认他们，便是否认革命。若打击他们，便是打击革命。”事实证明：贫农是农村中的革命阶级，他们最愿走社会主义道路。不依靠贫农，生产就不能发展，中农就不能团结，社会主义改造就不能完成，无产阶级专政就不能巩固。苏联自身的经验完全证明了这一点。
    中农是一个动摇的阶级。作为劳动者，他们倾向工人阶级；作为小私有者，他们倾向富农。如果不依靠贫农去团结中农，就势必加剧农村的两极分化，社会主义改造也就成了空话。《被开垦的处女地》中的“小布哈林”达维多夫所炮制的富农当经理，中农当骨干的“集体农庄”，难道能走社会主义道路？这样的“集体农庄”是白色的、假的，是肖洛霍夫按照他的反革命理想画出的复辟资本主义的变天图。
    集体化是康庄大道还是灾难无穷？
    布哈林仇恨社会主义，仇恨农业集体化运动，他危言耸听地说什么发展集体农庄会破坏工农联盟啦，向富农进攻会使国家没有粮食啦，会引起群众不满啦……总之，他把农业集体化说成是毁灭一切的怪物。
    主子定调，奴才帮腔。肖洛霍夫拾起布哈林的牙慧，向农业集体化射出密集的毒箭。在斯大林逝世后发表的小说第二部里，堆满了他对集体化的恶毒咒骂。他一笔抹煞斯大林领导的集体化运动的伟大成就，极力为布哈林招魂出气，为赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义大唱赞歌。
    集体化究竟是康庄大道还是灾难无穷，这是大是大非问题，不可不辩论清楚。
    毛主席教导我们：大多数农民“为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。”
    斯大林指出：“只有集体农庄才能使农民摆脱贫困和愚昧。”
    斯大林时代的苏联农民正是依靠农业集体化，改造了个体经济，摆脱了贫困，走上了社会主义康庄大道的。
    可是肖洛霍夫却狂叫集体化的“调调儿已经唱得到处掉眼泪了”。在他笔下，从办集体农庄起，灾难就伴着集体化来到格内米雅其村。
    好不容易集体农庄办起来了，但是，一有风吹草动，庄员们便乱得不可开交。一阵小牲口归公的谣言，就叫集体农庄在“两夜功夫，有角牲口少了一半”，大杀大吃。集体农庄之间尔虞我诈，抢土地，抢干草，打得头破血流。别的农庄来运种子，马上刮起一股抢粮风，把集体农庄的粮食抢个精光。……更恶毒的是肖洛霍夫借贫农舒卡尔夫妇的嘴，骂集体农庄“过着乱七八糟的生活，莫明其妙，颠三倒四”，“仓库里除了老鼠什么都没有，连老鼠都快饿死了”，“人的肚子快要贴到背脊骨了。”这字字声声，浸透了肖洛霍夫对集体化的刻骨仇恨！
    事实根本不是这样。苏联广大农民坚决拥护斯大林的号召，坚定地走农业集体化的道路。他们办起了集体农庄后，被压抑了千百年的积极性象火山一样爆发了出来。他们开展社会主义劳动竞赛，为苏维埃提供了大量粮食，粉碎了富农妄图饿死苏维埃的阴谋！他们的日子越过越好，精神面貌焕然一新。这些事实肖洛霍夫难道没有看见吗？不，反革命的本性使他睁着眼睛说瞎话！
    到了小说的最后部分，肖洛霍夫对集体化的攻击达到了最高峰。小说是从春种开始写到秋收结束。格内米雅其村春天种下了集体化的种子，秋天收到了什么果实呢？
    肖洛霍夫在人们眼前展现的秋天的集体农庄是一个凄凄惨惨哀鸿呜咽的黑暗世界：农庄里倒霉的事情越来越多，光在一天里，又是死人，又是少见的妇女难产，又是山羊落井淹死。接着，拉古尔洛夫、达维多夫又死在白匪手下。达维多夫的未婚妻哭哭啼啼回到村里，甚至连好吹牛的舒卡尔也“明显地变得衰弱”“孤僻寡言”，整夜在墓地里“叹气、划十字、流眼泪”。“夜越来越长，越来越黑”，“从漆黑的高空中传来鹤的哀唳，雁凄凉地互相呼应着，鹅克制地咯咯叫，鸭子拍拍地鼓动着翅膀”。肖洛霍夫笔下的格内米雅其村成了阴森可怕，暗无天日的地狱。在这里，看不到集体化的胜利，看不到人民的欢乐，看不到丰收的喜悦，看不到社会主义的优越性。
    在肖洛霍夫的笔下，格内米雅其村春天种下了集体化的种子，秋天收到的是无穷的灾难，死的死，走的走，散的散，凄凄惨惨切切。这是对集体化的侮辱，对苏联农民的侮辱，对斯大林的侮辱。但是，斯大林领导的农业集体化运动的伟大功勋是谁也抹杀不了的。篡改历史的人，终究要被历史的车轮轧得粉碎！
    赫鲁晓夫上台以后，肖洛霍夫就从布哈林的旗杆上跳到苏修领导集团的怀抱里，充当了赫鲁晓夫的吹鼓手。在斯大林死后发表的《被开垦的处女地》第二部中，肖洛霍夫极力兜售赫鲁晓夫的假共产主义、全民国家、全民党等修正主义臭货，为苏修领导集团复辟资本主义喝采叫好！
    现在的苏联，斯大林时代建立的集体农庄已名存实亡，苏联农业已走上自由经营、自由竞争的资本主义道路。苏修领导集团推行“利润挂帅”的“新经济体制”，大搞“分田到组”“分田到户”，扩大自留地，开办自由市场，资本主义自发势力恶性发展，两极分化越来越严重，社会主义经济已彻底瓦解了。苏修的“集体农庄”已成了“红色”富翁的乐园，广大苏联农民在苏修新沙皇压迫剥削下过着悲惨的生活！
    乌云遮天难持久，红日终将放光芒。苏联人民必将在战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想指引下，重新卷起十月革命的伟大风暴，卷掉《被开垦的处女地》等形形色色复辟资本主义的破烂货，推翻苏修新沙皇的宝座，重建光辉灿烂的社会主义。听！伟大导师毛主席的声音正响彻宇宙：“社会主义制度终究要代替资本主义制度，这是一个不以人们自己的意志为转移的客观规律。不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
