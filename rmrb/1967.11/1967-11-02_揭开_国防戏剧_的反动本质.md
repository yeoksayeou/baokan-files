Since the founding of the People's Republic, counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han Song, using their usurped positions, have operated propaganda machines to vigorously promote and revive so-called 1930s literature, especially 1930s theater, glorifying it as "revolutionary" theater under the "Party's leadership." They have praised it as having "created favorable conditions and opened up broad avenues for the superstructure of socialism in the field of theater art," and openly boasted that they want to "seriously summarize the experiences of the democratic revolutionary stage (theater) to correct our current work!"

This is a mad challenge by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat! It is a ferocious attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line!

We must resolutely strike back against the bourgeoisie's challenge, thoroughly criticize and expose the poisonous influence of so-called 1930s literature, and purge its toxic effects, allowing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to fly high in the realm of literature and art!

National Defense Theater or Surrender Theater?

"National Defense Theater" was launched under the banner of opposing Japanese imperialism. At that time, Zhou Yang proposed that "the theme of national defense should be the central theme of all writers, regardless of their class, ideology, and school of thought, to create anti-enemy and patriotic artworks, and to concentrate the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement in literature on the mainstream of anti-enemy and anti-traitor."

With the label of "National Defense" in front of "theater" and a grand declaration, it indeed caused a stir. However, lies cannot cover up the truth. A simple analysis of their creative practice reveals whether what they did was "National Defense Theater" or surrender theater.

Let's first look at Xia Yan's "Sai Jin Hua," which opened a new field for national defense dramas. It was released in 1936. At that time, the iron hoofs of the Japanese invaders had already trampled the forests and snows of Northeast China and were burning the smoke and flames towards the Great Wall. At this critical moment of the life and death of the Chinese nation, Chairman Mao pointed out that China faced two policies, two sets of methods, and two future choices: one was the policy and method of resolute resistance, whose future was "to expel Japanese imperialism and achieve China's freedom and liberation"; the other was the policy and method of compromise and surrender, whose future was "Japanese imperialism occupying China and the Chinese people becoming slaves."

"Sai Jin Hua" served the latter path. It brazenly distorted history, cursing the Boxers as "Boxer bandits" and "mob," claiming they were the "culprits" that invited imperialist aggression. On the contrary, it glorified imperialism, extolled the military prowess of the invaders, and spread the idea of worshipping and fearing the emperor, attempting to make people believe that imperialism was invincible. This was in line with the surrenderist rhetoric of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei! Even more vilely, the author elevated a prostitute, Sai Jin Hua, who had an affair with the commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance, Waldseem√ºller, during the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance, and served imperialism, to the status of "Goddess of Mercy." Through her, he advocated a "Sai Jin Hua personality" and "Sai Jin Hua spirit," which meant that as long as one could secure a moment of peace and survival, one could do anything: from selling one's body to surrendering and betraying the country. Obviously, this was to advocate surrenderism and betrayal, creating public opinion for Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the country! However, Xia Yan said he wrote "Sai Jin Hua" to "satirize the Nationalist Party's humiliating diplomacy." Nonsense! Clearly, he was hinting that the Nationalist Party should take Sai Jin Hua and her "skirt diplomacy" as an example, but he said it was "satire." What a shameless lie!

Advocating surrenderism inevitably means opposing revolutionary war. Chairman Mao had long pointed out that the only way to deal with Japanese imperialist aggression was "to use national revolutionary war to oppose national counter-revolutionary war." However, the champions of "National Defense Theater" sang a different tune. In the play "The End of Shi Dakai," the protagonist Shi Dakai advocated "using 'benevolence and righteousness' to persuade the enemy," "using 'benevolence and righteousness' to deal with war," and "not taking what others fight for and not going where others obstruct." In short, he wanted "to yield and compromise." Anyone with eyes could see that this was a replica of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's reactionary theories of "curve-saving the country" and "peaceful diplomacy"! Chiang Kai-shek said: "Peace should not be abandoned until it is utterly hopeless, and sacrifice should not be spoken of lightly until it is the last resort." Look: they were in perfect harmony! But the peacock's feathers could not cover the fox's tail, and cheap "benevolence and righteousness" could not change the essence of surrenderism! The author of the play could no longer hold back and shouted through Shi Dakai's mouth the common voice of traitors and betrayers: "Know this: surrender is shameful, but unavoidable surrender is acceptable! It is better to... come! Tie me up and surrender!"

In addition to such blatant opposition to the anti-Japanese war and peddling of surrenderism and betrayal, there was another type of work in "National Defense Theater." They either picked up some trash from the domestic and foreign historical dump and rewrote it, or they took a trivial aspect from the mundane life of petty bourgeoisie and described it. What they boasted about was nothing more than, under the formula of "anti-war plus love," bringing the reactionary military officers, landlords, capitalists, traitors, prostitutes, and parasites of the exploiting classes and social dregs of the Nationalist Party onto the stage, glorifying and singing their praises, and spreading their reactionary ideology and decadent lifestyle through them, inducing people to forget the national crisis and national disaster, lingering in the "green mountains outside the mountains and towers outside the towers" of a utopian world, and indulging in the "singing of the back palace flowers" of light songs and dances. It seemed unrelated to anti-Japanese war, but in reality, it was a spiritual opium that corrupted people's souls and eroded the people's fighting spirit. Lu Xun said: "Because it does not seem harmful, we always do not notice this fatal disease. Because this is a 'soft knife.'" The "soft knife" was more sinister and poisonous. For example, in "Lugou Bridge," Tian Han described two soldiers fighting over a girl on the front line under heavy fire. Was this to make people go to war and fight the enemy, or to make people surrender and die? Wasn't it clear?

Chairman Mao taught that literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Literature and art during the anti-Japanese period should serve the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. However, "National Defense Theater" did the opposite. It did not serve the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war but served the reactionary politics of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party's anti-communism, surrender, and betrayal. It did not expose the "brutality and deception" of the invaders and their "inevitable failure," but instead praised the strength and tyranny of the invaders and peddled surrenderist rhetoric. It did not sing the praises of the heroic deeds of the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians, encouraging the people to unite against the enemy and fight with one heart, but instead sang the praises of traitors and betrayers and peddled surrenderism and betrayal.

This was the inevitable result of Zhou Yang, Tian Han, and others betraying Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and implementing the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming. Chairman Mao pointed out incisively: "In the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war, class surrenderism is actually the reserve force of national surrenderism, the worst tendency to aid the right-wing camp and cause the war to fail." The path taken by "National Defense Theater" was precisely this reactionary path from class surrenderism to national surrenderism.

Revolutionary Theater or Traitor Theater?

In the anti-Japanese national united front, was it to insist on class struggle or to practice class reconciliation? This was the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Wang Ming's right-opportunist line, and it was also the focus of the struggle between Lu Xun's "mass literature of national revolutionary war" and Zhou Yang's "national defense literature."

Chairman Mao pointed out that the development of the Sino-Japanese national contradiction made domestic class contradictions secondary and subordinate, but "the contradictions themselves still exist and have not been reduced or eliminated." Therefore, within the united front, class struggle was inevitable. Wang Ming, however, completely denied class contradictions and obliterated class struggle. In response to this erroneous theory, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out: "The existence of classes and class struggle is a fact; some people deny this fact and deny the existence of class struggle, which is wrong."

Following Wang Ming's instructions, the advocates of "National Defense Theater" denied class struggle within the united front and in the ideological realm. They said that in addition to establishing the anti-Japanese national united front, "left-wing writers have no other special demands," and "it is not inappropriate to lower the standard of 'national defense literature' creation a little, ... regardless of their shortcomings in consciousness and technique, they should be given higher evaluations for the significance of their themes." Obviously, this was a replica of Wang Ming's theory. At that time, Lu Xun keenly saw the class surrenderist nature of this rhetoric and its serious consequences, pointing out: "To tell everyone about the suffering of becoming a slave of a different race with pen and tongue is indeed correct, but one must be very careful not to make everyone conclude: 'So, it is better to be a slave of our own people than to be a slave of a different race.'"

The facts were exactly as Lu Xun pointed out. Works that denied class struggle and advocated class reconciliation were everywhere in "National Defense Theater."

Look at three plays: "The State Above All," "Long Live the Nation," and "Total Mobilization." Even the titles of the plays were the language of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. Who's "state"? What kind of "nation"? Who is being "mobilized"? The state is a tool of class rule and has never existed in an abstract, classless form. Chairman Mao had long pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's "Republic of China" and his frequent shouting of "the state above all" were merely a beautiful cover to conceal his dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie and a deceptive trick to maintain his reactionary rule forever. As for the national question, Chairman Mao had also pointed out that it ultimately boiled down to a class question. Chairman Mao also warned that all slogans that mixed with the enemy were excuses for flattering and surrendering to the enemy. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, could one vaguely use "the state above all" and "long live the nation" as the call and principle for anti-Japanese resistance? Could one use "total mobilization" to obliterate class and class struggle? Could one not emphasize the position and role of the working class and peasant class led by the Communist Party in the anti-Japanese struggle, and expose the reactionary essence of Chiang Kai-shek's playing with these slogans?

However, Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others stood on the side of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, serving Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party faithfully and loyally. The "state" for which they shouted "above all" and "long live" was Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party's "state." They shouted loudly for "total mobilization" of landlords, gentry, "social butterflies," and speculators. In "National Defense Theater," those who were praised as "anti-Japanese heroes" could be said to be none other than these figures. In "Long Live the Nation," a landlord and gentry, Shi Guoxiong, was praised as an anti-Japanese "hero," and through his mouth, the theory of class reconciliation was repeatedly advocated. He said to farmers, herdsmen, hunters, and fishermen: "We all, originally have no hatred, our ancestors originally shared hardships and miseries together! They were of one heart when they fled and when they opened up this place!" This rhetoric was no different from Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rhetoric in his infamous "The Destiny of China" about everyone being descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Yang Han Song, in "Two-Faced People," through the mouth of the tea farmer Zhang Hongfa, described a big traitor, Zhu Mingzai, who colluded with the Japanese devils to secretly sell tea, as the "clothing and food father" and "peaceful Buddha" of the farmers. In "Night Cup," a dancing girl, Yu Lili, was described as a heroine with chivalrous bones and soft emotions, assassinating traitors. In "The Earth Returns to Spring," the capitalist Huang Yizhai opened a factory under Japanese air raids, and thus "the earth returned to spring." Using the words of the Chinese Khrushchev about the capitalist Song Qiongqing, it was said that "the revival of the nation and the people is at hand." As for the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, he was even hailed as the "supreme commander" of the anti-Japanese war and received the shout of "long live."

On the other hand, towards the proletariat and the working people, "National Defense Theater" maliciously defamed and slandered them. In "Long Live the Nation," the farmer Mei San shook hands with the traitor Lu Jianyan, expressing his willingness to "unite and not quarrel over past grievances," and said to him: "I believe you, farmers say a word and it will never change!" This was a great insult to the farmers! In "Two-Faced People," the tea farmer Zhang Hongfa was completely a figure like Wu Tingfang. He flatteringly praised the merits of the landlord and crawled at the landlord's feet, begging him not to surrender to the Japanese devils. Chairman Mao said: "Anti-Japanese, anti-Japanese, whose strength? Without the workers, peasants, and other petty bourgeoisie, you cannot take a step." However, "National Defense Theater" turned history upside down. The workers and peasants they described were dull and numb, and from them, one could not see the surging national consciousness and the fervent anti-Japanese sentiment. Even more vilely, they used the pretext of describing the lives of the working people to not only maliciously defame the working people but also to hint at and direct their spears at our great Party. The play "Feud" performed in Nanjing in November 1935 was exactly like this. The script was written by Tian Han and others under the orders of the Nationalist Party's cultural spy chief Zhang Daofan. The author, standing on the reactionary side, distorted the bloody class struggle of the ten-year civil war into a "brotherly" feud and a "private grudge," viciously directing the spearhead at our great Party, slandering it as the "culprit" that started the civil war, having the "bad habit" of being "brave in private fights and cowardly in public battles"; while the Nationalist Party of Chiang Kai-shek was the "example" of being "brave in public battles." In short, it completely absolved Chiang Kai-shek of the crime of launching a counter-revolutionary civil war. The script was thrown out at a time when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had successfully arrived in Shaanxi and was preparing to cross the river to resist Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek was mobilizing troops to attempt to "exterminate" the Shaanxi base area. As soon as it was released, the Nationalist Party authorities highly praised it, calling it the "vanguard of the new theater movement" and the "main force of the national theater movement." The enemy's praise was not a sign that it was creating public opinion for Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people war?

Enough, enough! These messy things, with their reactionary content and filthy language, expressed a common thought: opposing revolution, betraying revolution, selling principles, and surrendering to the enemy.

However, for a long time, Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others have been spreading the lie that "National Defense Theater" is "closely combined with the current revolutionary struggle, with full revolutionary feelings," and that they have "fought" with the Nationalist Party, etc. This is purely a lie! Is it "revolutionary" to obliterate class contradictions and class struggle and advocate class reconciliation? Is it "full of revolutionary feelings" to sing the praises of the exploiting classes and the Nationalist Party and smear the faces of the proletariat and the working people? The revolutionary proletariat has no common language with the traitors of revolution. Their so-called "revolution" is precisely what we call betrayal! Their so-called "struggle" is precisely what we call surrender!

The Leadership of the Communist Party or the Leadership of the Nationalist Party?

In the 1930s, the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Wang Ming's right-opportunist line was the issue of leadership within the united front. Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the principle of "independence and self-reliance" in the united front in terms of thought, politics, and organization, as well as the importance of "maintaining leadership," pointing out that "the issue of who leads whom must be sharply raised, and surrenderism must be resolutely opposed." In contrast, Wang Ming, from the beginning, voluntarily gave up the leadership of the Party in the united front, handing it over to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, advocating that "everything goes through the united front" and "everything submits to the united front," which in reality meant everything goes through and submits to Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party.

The struggle between the two lines within the Party inevitably reflected in the realm of literature and art. The Zhou Yang clique, following Wang Ming's instructions, willingly gave up the leadership of the proletariat over literature and art. Zhou Yang and others said that the united front was a union, "there is no such issue: who unified whom." "The 'main body' of the united front is not specific, and 'leadership' is not possessed by anyone. The fighters of various factions should jointly bear the responsibility of leadership under a common goal." They openly advocated that "Proletarians should not wear obvious badges" and "should not demand leadership, lest they drive away comrades of other classes." If that was the case, all they needed to do was to cozy up to the enemy and hug each other, what was the need for the Party's leadership? In response to the class surrenderist nature of the "National Defense Literature" slogan, the great man of the Chinese cultural revolution, Lu Xun, based on Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "anti-Japanese united front," put forward the slogan of "mass literature of national revolutionary war." This slogan embodied the clear position of proletarian literature and insisted on the leading position of proletarian literature in the united front. Lu Xun said: "It is not that revolutionary literature is abandoning its leadership responsibility, but rather that it is increasing and expanding its responsibility."

However, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Yang Han Song, the "four heroes," hated Lu Xun to the core for implementing the proletarian literary line and attacked him with all means. After Lu Xun's death, they even more brazenly distorted history, reversed black and white, and claimed that the bourgeois literary line they represented was the proletarian literary line. Tian Han and Xia Yan colluded with each other, praising "National Defense Theater" as having been "revolutionized" and taken the "socialist path" under the Party's leadership. This was completely self-deception and nonsense!

The leadership of the Party was the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It should be embodied in politics, ideology, and organization. As an important part of the literature and art of the 1930s, "National Defense Theater" was politically the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming, ideologically the thoughts of Russian bourgeois literary critics Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and Stanislavsky, and organizationally sectarianism and exclusivism. Such a theater, was it an embodiment of the "Party's leadership"?

It is worth noting that Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Han Song, and others were traitors and worms hidden within the revolutionary ranks. For a long time, they played the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick: on the surface, they disguised themselves as the embodiment of the Party, issuing orders in the name of the "imperial edict"; in reality, they surrendered to the Nationalist Party and acted as agents of the bourgeoisie and the Nationalist Party in the literary and theatrical movements.

Look at the facts:

When the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for a struggle against phenomena such as "some individuals in the Red Army after reorganization being unwilling to strictly accept the leadership of the Communist Party," it was precisely when Tian Han and others were leading their troops to serve the Nationalist Party faithfully. Chiang Kai-shek convened the Hengshan Military Conference, and they took the Peking Opera Troupe to "perform for comfort." After the great retreat in Hubei, they followed orders to fabricate "victories" and shout "Long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" in the "Song of Victory." In these acts of betrayal, what they accepted was not the leadership of the Nationalist Party?

When Chairman Mao taught us to insist on the principle of "independence and self-reliance in the united front," both to "maintain the positions we have already gained" and to "develop our positions," it was precisely when Tian Han and others handed over all the literary and artistic positions led by the Party to the Nationalist Party. They advised the Nationalist Party to reorganize ten theater troupes into direct tools for the reactionaries. Tian Han even sent his most proud students and troupes to Chen Cheng's subordinates to become spies and to "exterminate bandits." In these acts of betrayal, what they accepted was not the leadership of the Nationalist Party?

In 1940, the first wave of anti-communist attacks launched by Chiang Kai-shek aroused the indignation of the people across the country, but Tian Han and others, in the "Preface" of their published "Theater Chronicle," said that they remembered the wise decisions made by their "highest leader" at the Nan Yue Conference based on the bloody experience of the first phase of the anti-Japanese war, such as "politics above military affairs" and "propaganda above combat." Unfortunately, in the past year, we have not been able to quickly and effectively implement the slogans of that time, resulting in many of our shortcomings remaining unchanged or even worsening. This is truly a shame to the leader and the world!" Their "leader" was Chiang Kai-shek, and moreover, the "highest" one. Their party, was it not the Nationalist Party?

In early 1944, the Nationalist Party, in order to implement the "anti-communist nation-building" policy after the war, carried out spiritual mobilization and public opinion preparation, specially spending money and effort to hold the first Southwest Theater Exhibition, with Tian Han and Xia Yan taking the lead. At the exhibition, important military and political figures of the Nationalist Party, such as Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and Zhang Daofan, either operated behind the scenes or personally "instructed" the conference, proposing to the conference:

1. "Theatricalization of ideology." That is, the "Three Principles of the People" should be theatricalized, "the theater festival is the day to create theater of the Three Principles of the People."
2. "Educationalization of theater." "The script should adapt to the needs of anti-war and nation-building and cannot deviate from propaganda and education."
3. "The thought of the actors should be based on the Three Principles of the People." They should take Chiang Kai-shek's "The Destiny of China" as the highest guideline for all work and the highest standard for conduct.

This was clearly a "surrender contract" and "surrender notice" given by the Nationalist Party to Tian Han and others, but Tian Han and others willingly sold themselves and followed the master's intentions, carrying out the orders meticulously. They expressed their willingness to use theater to further mobilize for the Nationalist Party's policy of surrender and anti-communism. They took Chiang Kai-shek's slogan of "building the nation through anti-war" and applied it to the theater movement, calling on theater workers to contribute "all their wisdom, all their talents, and even our blood" for this. This was a comprehensive sale, betrayal, and surrender of the theater movement led by the Party in the Nationalist-controlled areas, from politics, ideology to organization! It was a concentrated exposure of Tian Han and others' consistent betrayal of the Party's leadership and implementation of the policy of surrenderism! What "Party's leadership" they talked about, was it not clear?

Two Reversals of Verdicts and a Wicked Wind

"National Defense Theater" was a product of Wang Ming's right-opportunist line. At that time, Lu Xun had already criticized it. Later, it was severely criticized by Chairman Mao many times. In his two epoch-making works, "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, announcing the complete bankruptcy of the slogans of "National Defense Literature" and "National Defense Theater."

However, the Zhou Yang clique paid lip service to Chairman Mao's criticism but secretly plotted to reverse the verdict. After the founding of the nation, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, they used their usurped positions and power to launch two large-scale reversals of the verdict on the "National Defense Literature" slogan and the revival of "National Defense Theater."

The first was from 1956 to 1958. Zhou Yang jumped out to advocate that the literature of the 1930s had already merged with the proletariat, forming a tradition of "expressing the people's struggle," and that "today's literary workers were all nurtured by this tradition." Later, they used a note in "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," an article "A Great Debate on the Literary Front," and a symposium praising the article to falsify and fabricate history in a despicable manner, attacking Lu Xun and dressing up the bourgeois slogan of "National Defense Literature" as a proletarian literary proposition. The "ancestors" and "old men" of the theater world, such as Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han Song, closely cooperated, issuing a "Suggestion to Commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Theater Movement and to Collect and Compile Theater Movement Materials and Publish a Collection of Theater Materials" in early 1957, calling for the use of past theater "experiences" and "traditions" to "correct" the important shortcomings of the socialist "theater movement." This was a declaration of counterattack and revenge, the opening drum of anti-Party and anti-socialism. When the bourgeois rightists and ghosts and monsters swarmed out, attacking the Party and socialism fiercely, Tian Han and others fanned the flames, responding closely, writing articles, holding memorial meetings, holding exhibitions, performing 1930s plays, summoning the spirits of "National Defense Theater," and launching a great counterattack and great offensive against Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

The second was from 1960 to 1962. The Zhou Yang clique used the 30th anniversary of the founding of the "Left-Wing Union" and the 20th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as opportunities, using the filming of the movie "Lu Xun" and the writing of "History of Modern Chinese Literature" as opportunities, to continue to slander Lu Xun and to whitewash the "National Defense Literature" slogan, shooting poisonous arrows at Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. Tian Han issued the anti-Party manifesto "To Summarize the Experiences of the Theater of the Democratic Revolutionary Stage" and, at the "National Drama, Opera, and Children's Drama Creation Symposium" held in Guangzhou, together with other ghosts and monsters, vented their grievances, spewed poison, and fiercely opposed the Party and socialism, calling for the revival of "National Defense Theater."

The reason why Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others spared no effort to advocate and revive the so-called literature of the 1930s was, on the one hand, to try to replace Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line with the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s, changing the correct direction of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. On the other hand, they tried to use this as political capital to build monuments for themselves, consolidate their hegemony in the literary world, and replace the Party and Mao Zedong Thought's leadership of literature. The ultimate goal of all this was to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, turning literature into a tool of public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, in order to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and change the color of the entire China.

A thunderclap, and the demons trembled. In the spring of 1966, the "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" thoroughly smashed the Zhou Yang clique's plot to revive the literature of the 1930s and "National Defense Theater." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, not only exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Zhou Yang but also exposed the mastermind behind the black line in literature and art, throwing everything from "National Defense Literature" to "National Defense Theater" into the garbage heap of history. It was truly:

"Asking the plague god where he is going, paper boats and bright torches burn in the sky."
