Since the founding of the People's Republic, counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han Song, using their usurped positions, have operated propaganda machines to vigorously promote and revive so-called 1930s literature, especially 1930s theater, glorifying it as "revolutionary" theater under the "Party's leadership." They have praised it as having "created favorable conditions and opened up broad avenues for the superstructure of socialism in the field of theater art," and openly boasted that they want to "seriously summarize the experiences of the democratic revolutionary stage (theater) to correct our current work!"

This is a mad challenge by the bourgeoisie against the proletariat! It is a ferocious attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line!

We must resolutely strike back against the bourgeoisie's challenge, thoroughly criticize and expose the poisonous influence of so-called 1930s literature, and purge its toxic effects, allowing the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to fly high in the realm of literature and art!

National Defense Theater or Surrender Theater?

"National Defense Theater" was launched under the banner of opposing Japanese imperialism. At that time, Zhou Yang proposed that "the theme of national defense should be the central theme of all writers, regardless of their class, ideology, and school of thought, to create anti-enemy and patriotic artworks, and to concentrate the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal movement in literature on the mainstream of anti-enemy and anti-traitor."

With the label of "National Defense" in front of "theater" and a grand declaration, it indeed caused a stir. However, lies cannot cover up the truth. A simple analysis of their creative practice reveals whether what they did was "National Defense Theater" or surrender theater.

Let's first look at Xia Yan's "Sai Jin Hua," which opened a new field for national defense dramas. It was released in 1936. At that time, the iron hoofs of the Japanese invaders had already trampled the forests and snows of Northeast China and were burning the smoke and flames towards the Great Wall. At this critical moment of the life and death of the Chinese nation, Chairman Mao pointed out that China faced two policies, two sets of methods, and two future choices: one was the policy and method of resolute resistance, whose future was "to expel Japanese imperialism and achieve China's freedom and liberation"; the other was the policy and method of compromise and surrender, whose future was "Japanese imperialism occupying China and the Chinese people becoming slaves."

"Sai Jin Hua" served the latter path. It brazenly distorted history, cursing the Boxers as "Boxer bandits" and "mob," claiming they were the "culprits" that invited imperialist aggression. On the contrary, it glorified imperialism, extolled the military prowess of the invaders, and spread the idea of worshipping and fearing the emperor, attempting to make people believe that imperialism was invincible. This was in line with the surrenderist rhetoric of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei! Even more vilely, the author elevated a prostitute, Sai Jin Hua, who had an affair with the commander of the Eight-Nation Alliance, Waldseemüller, during the invasion of Beijing by the Eight-Nation Alliance, and served imperialism, to the status of "Goddess of Mercy." Through her, he advocated a "Sai Jin Hua personality" and "Sai Jin Hua spirit," which meant that as long as one could secure a moment of peace and survival, one could do anything: from selling one's body to surrendering and betraying the country. Obviously, this was to advocate surrenderism and betrayal, creating public opinion for Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's betrayal of the country! However, Xia Yan said he wrote "Sai Jin Hua" to "satirize the Nationalist Party's humiliating diplomacy." Nonsense! Clearly, he was hinting that the Nationalist Party should take Sai Jin Hua and her "skirt diplomacy" as an example, but he said it was "satire." What a shameless lie!

Advocating surrenderism inevitably means opposing revolutionary war. Chairman Mao had long pointed out that the only way to deal with Japanese imperialist aggression was "to use national revolutionary war to oppose national counter-revolutionary war." However, the champions of "National Defense Theater" sang a different tune. In the play "The End of Shi Dakai," the protagonist Shi Dakai advocated "using 'benevolence and righteousness' to persuade the enemy," "using 'benevolence and righteousness' to deal with war," and "not taking what others fight for and not going where others obstruct." In short, he wanted "to yield and compromise." Anyone with eyes could see that this was a replica of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei's reactionary theories of "curve-saving the country" and "peaceful diplomacy"! Chiang Kai-shek said: "Peace should not be abandoned until it is utterly hopeless, and sacrifice should not be spoken of lightly until it is the last resort." Look: they were in perfect harmony! But the peacock's feathers could not cover the fox's tail, and cheap "benevolence and righteousness" could not change the essence of surrenderism! The author of the play could no longer hold back and shouted through Shi Dakai's mouth the common voice of traitors and betrayers: "Know this: surrender is shameful, but unavoidable surrender is acceptable! It is better to... come! Tie me up and surrender!"

In addition to such blatant opposition to the anti-Japanese war and peddling of surrenderism and betrayal, there was another type of work in "National Defense Theater." They either picked up some trash from the domestic and foreign historical dump and rewrote it, or they took a trivial aspect from the mundane life of petty bourgeoisie and described it. What they boasted about was nothing more than, under the formula of "anti-war plus love," bringing the reactionary military officers, landlords, capitalists, traitors, prostitutes, and parasites of the exploiting classes and social dregs of the Nationalist Party onto the stage, glorifying and singing their praises, and spreading their reactionary ideology and decadent lifestyle through them, inducing people to forget the national crisis and national disaster, lingering in the "green mountains outside the mountains and towers outside the towers" of a utopian world, and indulging in the "singing of the back palace flowers" of light songs and dances. It seemed unrelated to anti-Japanese war, but in reality, it was a spiritual opium that corrupted people's souls and eroded the people's fighting spirit. Lu Xun said: "Because it does not seem harmful, we always do not notice this fatal disease. Because this is a 'soft knife.'" The "soft knife" was more sinister and poisonous. For example, in "Lugou Bridge," Tian Han described two soldiers fighting over a girl on the front line under heavy fire. Was this to make people go to war and fight the enemy, or to make people surrender and die? Wasn't it clear?

Chairman Mao taught that literature and art belong to a certain class and a certain political line. Literature and art during the anti-Japanese period should serve the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war. However, "National Defense Theater" did the opposite. It did not serve the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war but served the reactionary politics of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party's anti-communism, surrender, and betrayal. It did not expose the "brutality and deception" of the invaders and their "inevitable failure," but instead praised the strength and tyranny of the invaders and peddled surrenderist rhetoric. It did not sing the praises of the heroic deeds of the anti-Japanese soldiers and civilians, encouraging the people to unite against the enemy and fight with one heart, but instead sang the praises of traitors and betrayers and peddled surrenderism and betrayal.

This was the inevitable result of Zhou Yang, Tian Han, and others betraying Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and implementing the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming. Chairman Mao pointed out incisively: "In the anti-Japanese national revolutionary war, class surrenderism is actually the reserve force of national surrenderism, the worst tendency to aid the right-wing camp and cause the war to fail." The path taken by "National Defense Theater" was precisely this reactionary path from class surrenderism to national surrenderism.

Revolutionary Theater or Traitor Theater?

In the anti-Japanese national united front, was it to insist on class struggle or to practice class reconciliation? This was the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Wang Ming's right-opportunist line, and it was also the focus of the struggle between Lu Xun's "mass literature of national revolutionary war" and Zhou Yang's "national defense literature."

Chairman Mao pointed out that the development of the Sino-Japanese national contradiction made domestic class contradictions secondary and subordinate, but "the contradictions themselves still exist and have not been reduced or eliminated." Therefore, within the united front, class struggle was inevitable. Wang Ming, however, completely denied class contradictions and obliterated class struggle. In response to this erroneous theory, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out: "The existence of classes and class struggle is a fact; some people deny this fact and deny the existence of class struggle, which is wrong."

Following Wang Ming's instructions, the advocates of "National Defense Theater" denied class struggle within the united front and in the ideological realm. They said that in addition to establishing the anti-Japanese national united front, "left-wing writers have no other special demands," and "it is not inappropriate to lower the standard of 'national defense literature' creation a little, ... regardless of their shortcomings in consciousness and technique, they should be given higher evaluations for the significance of their themes." Obviously, this was a replica of Wang Ming's theory. At that time, Lu Xun keenly saw the class surrenderist nature of this rhetoric and its serious consequences, pointing out: "To tell everyone about the suffering of becoming a slave of a different race with pen and tongue is indeed correct, but one must be very careful not to make everyone conclude: 'So, it is better to be a slave of our own people than to be a slave of a different race.'"

The facts were exactly as Lu Xun pointed out. Works that denied class struggle and advocated class reconciliation were everywhere in "National Defense Theater."

Look at three plays: "The State Above All," "Long Live the Nation," and "Total Mobilization." Even the titles of the plays were the language of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party. Who's "state"? What kind of "nation"? Who is being "mobilized"? The state is a tool of class rule and has never existed in an abstract, classless form. Chairman Mao had long pointed out that Chiang Kai-shek's "Republic of China" and his frequent shouting of "the state above all" were merely a beautiful cover to conceal his dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie and a deceptive trick to maintain his reactionary rule forever. As for the national question, Chairman Mao had also pointed out that it ultimately boiled down to a class question. Chairman Mao also warned that all slogans that mixed with the enemy were excuses for flattering and surrendering to the enemy. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, could one vaguely use "the state above all" and "long live the nation" as the call and principle for anti-Japanese resistance? Could one use "total mobilization" to obliterate class and class struggle? Could one not emphasize the position and role of the working class and peasant class led by the Communist Party in the anti-Japanese struggle, and expose the reactionary essence of Chiang Kai-shek's playing with these slogans?

However, Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others stood on the side of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, serving Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party faithfully and loyally. The "state" for which they shouted "above all" and "long live" was Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party's "state." They shouted loudly for "total mobilization" of landlords, gentry, "social butterflies," and speculators. In "National Defense Theater," those who were praised as "anti-Japanese heroes" could be said to be none other than these figures. In "Long Live the Nation," a landlord and gentry, Shi Guoxiong, was praised as an anti-Japanese "hero," and through his mouth, the theory of class reconciliation was repeatedly advocated. He said to farmers, herdsmen, hunters, and fishermen: "We all, originally have no hatred, our ancestors originally shared hardships and miseries together! They were of one heart when they fled and when they opened up this place!" This rhetoric was no different from Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary rhetoric in his infamous "The Destiny of China" about everyone being descendants of the Yellow Emperor. Yang Han Song, in "Two-Faced People," through the mouth of the tea farmer Zhang Hongfa, described a big traitor, Zhu Mingzai, who colluded with the Japanese devils to secretly sell tea, as the "clothing and food father" and "peaceful Buddha" of the farmers. In "Night Cup," a dancing girl, Yu Lili, was described as a heroine with chivalrous bones and soft emotions, assassinating traitors. In "The Earth Returns to Spring," the capitalist Huang Yizhai opened a factory under Japanese air raids, and thus "the earth returned to spring." Using the words of the Chinese Khrushchev about the capitalist Song Qiongqing, it was said that "the revival of the nation and the people is at hand." As for the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, he was even hailed as the "supreme commander" of the anti-Japanese war and received the shout of "long live."

On the other hand, towards the proletariat and the working people, "National Defense Theater" maliciously defamed and slandered them. In "Long Live the Nation," the farmer Mei San shook hands with the traitor Lu Jianyan, expressing his willingness to "unite and not quarrel over past grievances," and said to him: "I believe you, farmers say a word and it will never change!" This was a great insult to the farmers! In "Two-Faced People," the tea farmer Zhang Hongfa was completely a figure like Wu Tingfang. He flatteringly praised the merits of the landlord and crawled at the landlord's feet, begging him not to surrender to the Japanese devils. Chairman Mao said: "Anti-Japanese, anti-Japanese, whose strength? Without the workers, peasants, and other petty bourgeoisie, you cannot take a step." However, "National Defense Theater" turned history upside down. The workers and peasants they described were dull and numb, and from them, one could not see the surging national consciousness and the fervent anti-Japanese sentiment. Even more vilely, they used the pretext of describing the lives of the working people to not only maliciously defame the working people but also to hint at and direct their spears at our great Party. The play "Feud" performed in Nanjing in November 1935 was exactly like this. The script was written by Tian Han and others under the orders of the Nationalist Party's cultural spy chief Zhang Daofan. The author, standing on the reactionary side, distorted the bloody class struggle of the ten-year civil war into a "brotherly" feud and a "private grudge," viciously directing the spearhead at our great Party, slandering it as the "culprit" that started the civil war, having the "bad habit" of being "brave in private fights and cowardly in public battles"; while the Nationalist Party of Chiang Kai-shek was the "example" of being "brave in public battles." In short, it completely absolved Chiang Kai-shek of the crime of launching a counter-revolutionary civil war. The script was thrown out at a time when the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army had successfully arrived in Shaanxi and was preparing to cross the river to resist Japan, and Chiang Kai-shek was mobilizing troops to attempt to "exterminate" the Shaanxi base area. As soon as it was released, the Nationalist Party authorities highly praised it, calling it the "vanguard of the new theater movement" and the "main force of the national theater movement." The enemy's praise was not a sign that it was creating public opinion for Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people war?

Enough, enough! These messy things, with their reactionary content and filthy language, expressed a common thought: opposing revolution, betraying revolution, selling principles, and surrendering to the enemy.

However, for a long time, Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others have been spreading the lie that "National Defense Theater" is "closely combined with the current revolutionary struggle, with full revolutionary feelings," and that they have "fought" with the Nationalist Party, etc. This is purely a lie! Is it "revolutionary" to obliterate class contradictions and class struggle and advocate class reconciliation? Is it "full of revolutionary feelings" to sing the praises of the exploiting classes and the Nationalist Party and smear the faces of the proletariat and the working people? The revolutionary proletariat has no common language with the traitors of revolution. Their so-called "revolution" is precisely what we call betrayal! Their so-called "struggle" is precisely what we call surrender!

The Leadership of the Communist Party or the Leadership of the Nationalist Party?

In the 1930s, the focus of the struggle between Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and Wang Ming's right-opportunist line was the issue of leadership within the united front. Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized the principle of "independence and self-reliance" in the united front in terms of thought, politics, and organization, as well as the importance of "maintaining leadership," pointing out that "the issue of who leads whom must be sharply raised, and surrenderism must be resolutely opposed." In contrast, Wang Ming, from the beginning, voluntarily gave up the leadership of the Party in the united front, handing it over to Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, advocating that "everything goes through the united front" and "everything submits to the united front," which in reality meant everything goes through and submits to Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party.

The struggle between the two lines within the Party inevitably reflected in the realm of literature and art. The Zhou Yang clique, following Wang Ming's instructions, willingly gave up the leadership of the proletariat over literature and art. Zhou Yang and others said that the united front was a union, "there is no such issue: who unified whom." "The 'main body' of the united front is not specific, and 'leadership' is not possessed by anyone. The fighters of various factions should jointly bear the responsibility of leadership under a common goal." They openly advocated that "Proletarians should not wear obvious badges" and "should not demand leadership, lest they drive away comrades of other classes." If that was the case, all they needed to do was to cozy up to the enemy and hug each other, what was the need for the Party's leadership? In response to the class surrenderist nature of the "National Defense Literature" slogan, the great man of the Chinese cultural revolution, Lu Xun, based on Chairman Mao's great strategic thought of "anti-Japanese united front," put forward the slogan of "mass literature of national revolutionary war." This slogan embodied the clear position of proletarian literature and insisted on the leading position of proletarian literature in the united front. Lu Xun said: "It is not that revolutionary literature is abandoning its leadership responsibility, but rather that it is increasing and expanding its responsibility."

However, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Tian Han, and Yang Han Song, the "four heroes," hated Lu Xun to the core for implementing the proletarian literary line and attacked him with all means. After Lu Xun's death, they even more brazenly distorted history, reversed black and white, and claimed that the bourgeois literary line they represented was the proletarian literary line. Tian Han and Xia Yan colluded with each other, praising "National Defense Theater" as having been "revolutionized" and taken the "socialist path" under the Party's leadership. This was completely self-deception and nonsense!

The leadership of the Party was the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, the leadership of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. It should be embodied in politics, ideology, and organization. As an important part of the literature and art of the 1930s, "National Defense Theater" was politically the right-opportunist line of Wang Ming, ideologically the thoughts of Russian bourgeois literary critics Belinsky, Chernyshevsky, Dobrolyubov, and Stanislavsky, and organizationally sectarianism and exclusivism. Such a theater, was it an embodiment of the "Party's leadership"?

It is worth noting that Tian Han, Xia Yan, Yang Han Song, and others were traitors and worms hidden within the revolutionary ranks. For a long time, they played the counter-revolutionary two-faced trick: on the surface, they disguised themselves as the embodiment of the Party, issuing orders in the name of the "imperial edict"; in reality, they surrendered to the Nationalist Party and acted as agents of the bourgeoisie and the Nationalist Party in the literary and theatrical movements.

Look at the facts:

When the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao called for a struggle against phenomena such as "some individuals in the Red Army after reorganization being unwilling to strictly accept the leadership of the Communist Party," it was precisely when Tian Han and others were leading their troops to serve the Nationalist Party faithfully. Chiang Kai-shek convened the Hengshan Military Conference, and they took the Peking Opera Troupe to "perform for comfort." After the great retreat in Hubei, they followed orders to fabricate "victories" and shout "Long live Chairman Chiang Kai-shek" in the "Song of Victory." In these acts of betrayal, what they accepted was not the leadership of the Nationalist Party?

When Chairman Mao taught us to insist on the principle of "independence and self-reliance in the united front," both to "maintain the positions we have already gained" and to "develop our positions," it was precisely when Tian Han and others handed over all the literary and artistic positions led by the Party to the Nationalist Party. They advised the Nationalist Party to reorganize ten theater troupes into direct tools for the reactionaries. Tian Han even sent his most proud students and troupes to Chen Cheng's subordinates to become spies and to "exterminate bandits." In these acts of betrayal, what they accepted was not the leadership of the Nationalist Party?

In 1940, the first wave of anti-communist attacks launched by Chiang Kai-shek aroused the indignation of the people across the country, but Tian Han and others, in the "Preface" of their published "Theater Chronicle," said that they remembered the wise decisions made by their "highest leader" at the Nan Yue Conference based on the bloody experience of the first phase of the anti-Japanese war, such as "politics above military affairs" and "propaganda above combat." Unfortunately, in the past year, we have not been able to quickly and effectively implement the slogans of that time, resulting in many of our shortcomings remaining unchanged or even worsening. This is truly a shame to the leader and the world!" Their "leader" was Chiang Kai-shek, and moreover, the "highest" one. Their party, was it not the Nationalist Party?

In early 1944, the Nationalist Party, in order to implement the "anti-communist nation-building" policy after the war, carried out spiritual mobilization and public opinion preparation, specially spending money and effort to hold the first Southwest Theater Exhibition, with Tian Han and Xia Yan taking the lead. At the exhibition, important military and political figures of the Nationalist Party, such as Chen Cheng, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and Zhang Daofan, either operated behind the scenes or personally "instructed" the conference, proposing to the conference:

1. "Theatricalization of ideology." That is, the "Three Principles of the People" should be theatricalized, "the theater festival is the day to create theater of the Three Principles of the People."
2. "Educationalization of theater." "The script should adapt to the needs of anti-war and nation-building and cannot deviate from propaganda and education."
3. "The thought of the actors should be based on the Three Principles of the People." They should take Chiang Kai-shek's "The Destiny of China" as the highest guideline for all work and the highest standard for conduct.

This was clearly a "surrender contract" and "surrender notice" given by the Nationalist Party to Tian Han and others, but Tian Han and others willingly sold themselves and followed the master's intentions, carrying out the orders meticulously. They expressed their willingness to use theater to further mobilize for the Nationalist Party's policy of surrender and anti-communism. They took Chiang Kai-shek's slogan of "building the nation through anti-war" and applied it to the theater movement, calling on theater workers to contribute "all their wisdom, all their talents, and even our blood" for this. This was a comprehensive sale, betrayal, and surrender of the theater movement led by the Party in the Nationalist-controlled areas, from politics, ideology to organization! It was a concentrated exposure of Tian Han and others' consistent betrayal of the Party's leadership and implementation of the policy of surrenderism! What "Party's leadership" they talked about, was it not clear?

Two Reversals of Verdicts and a Wicked Wind

"National Defense Theater" was a product of Wang Ming's right-opportunist line. At that time, Lu Xun had already criticized it. Later, it was severely criticized by Chairman Mao many times. In his two epoch-making works, "On New Democracy" and "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized the bourgeois literary line represented by Zhou Yang from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, announcing the complete bankruptcy of the slogans of "National Defense Literature" and "National Defense Theater."

However, the Zhou Yang clique paid lip service to Chairman Mao's criticism but secretly plotted to reverse the verdict. After the founding of the nation, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, they used their usurped positions and power to launch two large-scale reversals of the verdict on the "National Defense Literature" slogan and the revival of "National Defense Theater."

The first was from 1956 to 1958. Zhou Yang jumped out to advocate that the literature of the 1930s had already merged with the proletariat, forming a tradition of "expressing the people's struggle," and that "today's literary workers were all nurtured by this tradition." Later, they used a note in "The Complete Works of Lu Xun," an article "A Great Debate on the Literary Front," and a symposium praising the article to falsify and fabricate history in a despicable manner, attacking Lu Xun and dressing up the bourgeois slogan of "National Defense Literature" as a proletarian literary proposition. The "ancestors" and "old men" of the theater world, such as Tian Han, Xia Yan, and Yang Han Song, closely cooperated, issuing a "Suggestion to Commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Theater Movement and to Collect and Compile Theater Movement Materials and Publish a Collection of Theater Materials" in early 1957, calling for the use of past theater "experiences" and "traditions" to "correct" the important shortcomings of the socialist "theater movement." This was a declaration of counterattack and revenge, the opening drum of anti-Party and anti-socialism. When the bourgeois rightists and ghosts and monsters swarmed out, attacking the Party and socialism fiercely, Tian Han and others fanned the flames, responding closely, writing articles, holding memorial meetings, holding exhibitions, performing 1930s plays, summoning the spirits of "National Defense Theater," and launching a great counterattack and great offensive against Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line.

The second was from 1960 to 1962. The Zhou Yang clique used the 30th anniversary of the founding of the "Left-Wing Union" and the 20th anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" as opportunities, using the filming of the movie "Lu Xun" and the writing of "History of Modern Chinese Literature" as opportunities, to continue to slander Lu Xun and to whitewash the "National Defense Literature" slogan, shooting poisonous arrows at Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line. Tian Han issued the anti-Party manifesto "To Summarize the Experiences of the Theater of the Democratic Revolutionary Stage" and, at the "National Drama, Opera, and Children's Drama Creation Symposium" held in Guangzhou, together with other ghosts and monsters, vented their grievances, spewed poison, and fiercely opposed the Party and socialism, calling for the revival of "National Defense Theater."

The reason why Zhou Yang, Tian Han, Xia Yan, and others spared no effort to advocate and revive the so-called literature of the 1930s was, on the one hand, to try to replace Chairman Mao's proletarian literary line with the bourgeois literary line of the 1930s, changing the correct direction of literature serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics. On the other hand, they tried to use this as political capital to build monuments for themselves, consolidate their hegemony in the literary world, and replace the Party and Mao Zedong Thought's leadership of literature. The ultimate goal of all this was to oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, turning literature into a tool of public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, in order to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship and change the color of the entire China.

A thunderclap, and the demons trembled. In the spring of 1966, the "Minutes of the Symposium on Army Literary and Art Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing" thoroughly smashed the Zhou Yang clique's plot to revive the literature of the 1930s and "National Defense Theater." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, not only exposed the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Zhou Yang but also exposed the mastermind behind the black line in literature and art, throwing everything from "National Defense Literature" to "National Defense Theater" into the garbage heap of history. It was truly:

"Asking the plague god where he is going, paper boats and bright torches burn in the sky."

    揭开“国防戏剧”的反动本质
    中国革命剧协　南开大学《卫东》编辑部
    建国以来，反革命修正主义分子周扬、林默涵、田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙之流，利用他们所窃踞的职位，开动宣传机器，极力鼓吹和复活所谓三十年代文艺，特别是三十年代戏剧，把它美化为在“党的领导下”的“革命”戏剧；吹捧为“为社会主义上层建筑，戏剧艺术方面，创造了有利条件，开辟了广阔的道路”，公然叫嚣要“认真总结一下民主革命阶段（戏剧）的经验，来改正我们当前的工作”！
    这是资产阶级向无产阶级的疯狂挑战！是向毛主席革命文艺路线发动的猖狂进攻！
    我们一定要痛击资产阶级的挑战，批深批臭所谓三十年代文艺，肃清它的流毒和影响，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在文艺阵地上高高飘扬！
               “国防戏剧”，还是卖国戏剧？
      “国防戏剧”是以反对日本帝国主义为旗帜抛出的。当时周扬就提出“国防的主题应当成为汉奸以外的一切作家的作品之最中心之主题”。一切作家，不问他们所属的阶级、思想和流派，“都来创造抗敌救国的艺术作品，把文学上反帝反封建的运动集中到抗敌反汉奸的主流。”
    在“戏剧”前面冠以“国防”的招牌，再加上堂而皇之的宣言，确实喧嚣一时。但是，谎言掩盖不住真相，只要分析一下他们的创作实践，就可看出他们所搞的究竟是“国防戏剧”，还是卖国戏剧？
    先来看“给国防剧作开辟了一个新的园地”的夏衍的《赛金花》。它出笼于一九三六年。当时，日本侵略者的铁蹄已经践踏了东北的林海雪原，正把狼烟烽火烧向长城内外。在这中华民族生死存亡的关键时刻，毛主席指出，中国面临着两种方针、两套办法和两个前途的抉择：一条是坚决抗战的方针、办法，其前途是“驱逐日本帝国主义、实现中国自由解放”。一条是妥协投降的方针、办法，其前途是“日本帝国主义占领中国、中国人民都做牛马奴隶”。
    《赛金花》正是为后一条道路服务的。它肆意歪曲历史，骂义和团是“拳匪”、“暴民”，是招致帝国主义侵略的“罪魁祸首”。相反，却大肆美化帝国主义，尽情宣扬侵略者的武功，极力散布崇帝、恐帝思想，妄图使人们相信：帝国主义是强大的，不可战胜的。这同当时蒋介石、汪精卫之流的亡国论调如出一辙！更恶毒的是，作者把一个在“八国联军”入侵北京期间，同联军统帅瓦德西私姘，为帝国主义奔走效劳的汉奸妓女赛金花，捧上“救苦救难”“观世音”的宝座，借她来提倡一种“赛金花人格”、“赛金花精神”，即只要能够图得一时的苟安偷生，什么事都可以干：从出卖肉体到投降卖国。显然，这是鼓吹投降主义和卖国主义，是为蒋介石、汪精卫之流投敌卖国制造舆论！但是，夏衍却说他写《赛金花》是为了“讽刺国民党的屈辱外交”。呸！明明是在暗示国民党以赛金花和她的“裙钗外交”为榜样，却说是什么“讽刺”，真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    鼓吹卖国主义，必然要反对革命战争。毛主席早就指出，对付日本帝国主义的侵略战争只有一个方法，就是“用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争”。但是，“国防戏剧”的干将们却大唱反调。《石达开的末路》一剧中的主人公石达开鼓吹什么“我只想以‘仁义’劝服敌人”，“以‘仁义’对付战争”，“别人争的地方，我不要，别人阻挠的地方，我不走”，一言以蔽之，要“委曲求全”。明眼人一眼看穿，这正是蒋介石、汪精卫的“曲线救国”、“和平外交”等反动理论的翻版！蒋介石说：“和平未至绝望时期决不放弃和平，牺牲未至最后关头决不轻言牺牲”。请看：一唱一和，配合得多么紧密协调！但是，孔雀外衣掩盖不住狐狸尾巴，廉价的“仁义”岂能改变投降主义的实质！剧本作者也终于按捺不住，借石达开之口喊出了汉奸、卖国贼的共同心声：“要知道：投降，是无耻的，但是不得已的投降，是可以的！”“与其冲杀出去，而白白牺牲了千多人，还不如……来！绑了我去投降！”
    除了如此露骨地反对抗日战争、兜售投降主义和卖国主义的作品以外，“国防戏剧”中还有一类作品，他们或者从中外历史垃圾堆里拣来一些破烂加以改编；或者从庸俗平凡的小市民生活中摭取一端加以描写。他们所极力吹嘘的，也不过在“抗战加恋爱”的公式之下，把国民党反动军官、地主、资本家、汉奸、妓女等剥削阶级寄生虫和社会渣滓，搬上舞台，加以美化歌颂，并且通过他们散布其反动的思想意识和腐朽糜烂的生活方式，诱使人们忘记民族危机，国家灾难，耽留于“山外青山楼外楼”的世外桃源，沉湎于“隔江犹唱后庭花”的轻歌漫舞。看起来同抗日无关，实际上是腐蚀人们灵魂，消磨人民斗志的精神鸦片烟。鲁迅说过：“正因为并不觉得怎样有害，我们这才总是觉不出这致死的毛病来。因为这是‘软刀子’。”“软刀子”更阴险、更毒辣。比如田汉在《芦沟桥》中，描写两个士兵在炮火连天的前线，公然为追逐一个姑娘而打起架来。这究竟是要人们去抗战杀敌，还是要人们去投降死亡？不是很清楚吗？
    毛主席教导说：文艺是属于一定的阶级和一定的政治路线的。抗日时期的文艺，应该为抗日民族革命战争服务。“国防戏剧”却反其道而行之。它不是为抗日民族革命战争服务，而是为蒋介石国民党的反共、投敌、卖国的反动政治服务。不是去揭露侵略者的“残暴和欺骗”及其“必然要失败的趋势”，反而宣扬侵略者的强大和淫威，兜售亡国论调。不是去歌颂抗日军民的英勇业绩，鼓励人民同仇敌忾，万众一心，反而歌颂汉奸卖国贼，贩卖投降主义和卖国主义。
    这是周扬、田汉之流背叛毛主席无产阶级革命路线，贯彻执行王明右倾机会主义路线的必然结果。毛主席一针见血地指出：“在抗日民族革命战争中，阶级投降主义实际上是民族投降主义的后备军，是援助右翼营垒而使战争失败的最恶劣的倾向。”“国防戏剧”所走的，正是这条由阶级投降主义到民族投降主义的反动道路。
               “革命”戏剧，还是叛徒戏剧？
    在抗日民族统一战线中，是坚持阶级斗争，还是实行阶级调和？这是毛主席无产阶级革命路线同王明右倾机会主义路线争论的焦点，也是鲁迅的“民族革命战争的大众文学”同周扬的“国防文学”两个口号争论的焦点。
    毛主席指出，中日民族矛盾的发展，使国内阶级矛盾变成次要和服从的东西，但是，“矛盾本身依然存在着，并没有减少或消灭”。因此，在统一战线内部，阶级斗争是不可避免的。王明却根本否认阶级矛盾，抹煞阶级斗争。针对这种错误论调，毛主席尖锐指出：“阶级和阶级斗争的存在是一个事实；有些人否认这种事实，否认阶级斗争的存在，这是错误的。”
    秉承王明的意旨，“国防戏剧”的鼓吹者否认在统一战线内部和在意识形态领域内的阶级斗争。他们说，除了建立抗日民族统一战线以外，“左翼作家也并无其他特殊要求”，“不妨把‘国防文学’创作的标准放低一些，……不管他们意识上和技巧上的缺点，应当以那主题的意义而得到较高的评价”。很明显，这是王明理论的翻版。当时，鲁迅尖锐地看到了这种论调的阶级投降主义的实质和它的严重后果，指出：“用笔和舌，将沦为异族的奴隶之苦告诉大家，自然是不错的，但要十分小心，不可使大家得着这样的结论：‘那么，到底还不如我们似的做自己人的奴隶好。’”
    事实正象鲁迅所指出的那样，否认阶级斗争，宣扬阶级调和的作品，在“国防戏剧”中比比皆是。
    请看三个剧本：《国家至上》《民族万岁》和《总动员》，连剧本名字都是蒋介石国民党的语言。试问：是谁的“国家”？是怎样的“民族”？是“动员”什么人？国家是阶级统治的工具，从来不存在什么抽象的、超阶级的国家。毛主席早就指出，蒋介石的“中华民国”，以及他经常狂叫的“国家至上”，只是用来掩盖其大地主、大资产阶级专政的美丽外衣和妄图维护其反动统治使之永世长存的欺骗伎俩而已。至于民族问题，毛主席也早就指出，归根到底是阶级问题。毛主席还警告说，一切与敌人混同的口号，都是媚敌降敌的幌子。按照毛主席的这些教导，难道可以笼统地以“国家至上”和“民族万岁”作为抗日的号召和原则，难道可以拿“总动员”为名去抹煞阶级和阶级斗争，难道可以不去强调中国共产党所领导的工人阶级和农民阶级等革命主力在抗日中的地位和作用，戳穿蒋介石玩弄这些口号的反动实质吗？
    然而，周扬、田汉、夏衍之流却站在大地主、大资产阶级立场上，对蒋介石国民党服服贴贴，尽忠尽孝。他们为之高呼“至上”、“万岁”的“国家”，是蒋介石国民党的“国家”。他们声嘶力竭“总动员”的，是地主、豪绅、“交际花”、投机商人之类的社会渣滓。在“国防戏剧”中，被当作“抗日英雄”来歌颂的，可以说无一不是这类人物。《民族万岁》里把一个地主豪绅史国雄当作抗日“英雄”来歌颂，借他之口不止一次地宣扬阶级调和论。他对农民、牧人、猎户和渔民们说：“我们大家，本来没有仇恨，我们的祖先本来是同过艰苦患难来的！他们在逃难的时候，在开垦这块地方的时候，大家都是一条心的！”这种论调，同蒋介石在其臭名昭著的《中国之命运》中所散布的大家都是黄帝的子孙的反动论调有什么两样？阳翰笙在《两面人》里，借茶农张洪发之口把一个勾通日寇偷做茶叶买卖的大汉奸祝茗斋，说成是农民的“衣食父母，平安菩萨”。《夜光杯》里，把一个舞女郁丽丽描写成侠骨柔情，行刺汉奸的“巾帼英雄”。《大地回春》描写资本家黄毅哉在日本飞机轰炸下还开办工厂，于是“大地回春”，用中国赫鲁晓夫对资本家宋棐卿的话说，则“国家民族之复兴指日可待也”。至于人民公敌蒋介石，那更是被当作抗日的“最高统帅”而受“万岁”的欢呼的。
    另一方面，对无产阶级和劳动人民，“国防戏剧”却百般丑化，大肆诬蔑。《民族万岁》里的农民梅三跟汉奸陆侃言握手言欢，表示要“上下一心，不要争过去的恩怨”，并对他说：“我相信你，我们农民说出一句话，就永远不会更改的！”这简直是对农民的最大的污辱！《两面人》里的茶农张洪发，完全是一个武训式的人物。他肉麻地宣扬地主的功德，并且匍匐在地主的脚下，乞求他不要去投降日寇。毛主席说：“抗日，抗日，是谁之力？离了工人、农民和其他小资产阶级，你就不能走动一步。”然而“国防戏剧”却颠倒历史，他们所描写的工人、农民，浑浑噩噩，麻木不仁，从他们身上，根本看不到高涨的民族意识、亢奋的抗日情绪。更恶毒的是，他们打着描写劳动人民生活的幌子，不仅恣意丑化劳动人民，而且含沙射影，把矛头指向我们伟大的党。一九三五年十一月在南京演出的《械斗》一剧就是如此。剧本是田汉等接受蒋匪文化特务头子张道藩的旨意写成的。作者站在反动立场上，把十年内战这场血淋淋的阶级斗争歪曲成什么“兄弟”之争，什么“私仇”，恶毒地把矛头对准我们伟大的党，诬蔑它是发动内战的“罪魁祸首”，象“笨牛”一样有着“勇于私斗、怯于公战”的“劣根性”；而蒋介石国民党则是“勇于公战”的“榜样”。一句话，它把蒋介石发动反革命内战的罪责开脱得干干净净。剧本是在中国工农红军胜利到达陕北准备东渡抗日，蒋介石调兵遣将妄图“围剿”陕北根据地的时候抛出的。它一出笼，国民党当局就大捧特捧，誉为“新兴戏剧的急先锋”，“全国剧运的主力军”。敌人如此赞扬，不正说明它是为蒋介石反共反人民的战争制造舆论的吗？
    够了，够了！这些乌七八糟的东西，以其反动的内容和肮脏的语言，表达了一个共同的思想，这就是：反对革命，背叛革命，出卖原则，投降敌人。
    然而，长期以来，周扬、田汉、夏衍之流却大肆宣传，说什么“国防戏剧”是“紧密地配合当前的革命斗争，革命感情很饱满”的，是同国民党进行了“斗争”的等等，这纯粹是骗人的鬼话！难道抹煞阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，宣扬阶级调和论，算是“革命”吗？难道为剥削阶级和国民党歌功颂德，树碑立传，往无产阶级和劳动人民脸上抹黑，也算是“革命感情很饱满”吗？无产阶级革命派同革命叛徒之间根本没有共同的语言。他们的所谓“革命”，正是我们说的背叛！他们的所谓“斗争”，正是我们所说的投降！
               共产党的领导，还是国民党的领导？
    在三十年代，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和王明的右倾机会主义路线斗争的焦点，是统一战线的领导权的问题。毛主席一再强调统一战线中党在思想上、政治上和组织上的“独立自主的原则”以及“坚持领导权”的重要性，指出“必须尖锐地提出谁领导谁的问题，必须坚决地反对投降主义”。与此相反，王明从一开始就自愿放弃统一战线中党的领导权，把它拱手让给蒋介石国民党，主张“一切经过统一战线”，“一切服从统一战线”，实际上就是一切经过、服从蒋介石和国民党。
    党内两条路线的斗争，必然要反映到文艺上来。周扬一伙秉承王明的意旨，心甘情愿地放弃无产阶级对文艺的领导权。周扬之流说，统一战线是联合，“这里没有这样的问题：谁统一了谁。”“统一战线的‘主体’并不是特定的，‘领导权’并不是谁所专有的。各派的斗士，应该在共同的目标下，共同负起领导的责任来。”公然主张“普洛不应该挂起明显的徽章”，“去要求领导权，以至吓跑别的阶级的战友”。既然如此，那只需同敌人卿卿我我，互相拥抱就行了，还要党的领导干什么呢？针对“国防文学”口号的阶级投降主义实质，中国文化革命的伟人鲁迅，根据毛主席提出的“抗日统一战线”的伟大战略思想，提出了“民族革命战争的大众文学”口号。这一口号体现了无产阶级文学的鲜明立场，坚持了无产阶级文艺在统一战线中的领导地位。鲁迅说：“决非革命文学要放弃它的阶级的领导的责任，而是将它的责任更加重，更放大”。
    但是，周扬、夏衍、田汉、阳翰笙这“四条汉子”，对贯彻无产阶级文艺路线的鲁迅恨之入骨，不择手段地进行围攻。鲁迅逝世以后，他们更是肆无忌惮地篡改历史，颠倒黑白，把他们代表的资产阶级文艺路线说成是无产阶级文艺路线。田汉、夏衍之流互相勾结，把“国防戏剧”吹捧为“在党领导下”的已经“革命化”和走上“社会主义道路”的无产阶级戏剧。这完全是自欺欺人，一派胡言！
    党的领导，就是毛泽东思想的领导，就是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的领导。它要体现在政治、思想和组织等各个方面。作为三十年代文艺重要组成部分的“国防戏剧”，政治上是王明“左”右倾机会主义路线，文艺思想上是俄国资产阶级文艺评论家别林斯基、车尔尼雪夫斯基、杜勃罗留波夫以及斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基的思想，组织上是宗派主义和关门主义。这样的戏剧，难道是体现了“党的领导”吗？
    值得指出的是：田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙等人，是混入和暗藏在革命队伍内部的叛徒和蛆虫。长期以来，他们玩弄反革命两面手法：表面上，把自己打扮成党的化身，假传“圣旨”，发号施令；实际上，投降国民党，充当了资产阶级和国民党在文艺、戏剧运动内部的代理人。
    请看事实：
    当党中央和毛主席号召同“表现在红军改编后某些个别分子不愿意严格地接受共产党的领导”等现象进行斗争的时候，也正是田汉等人带着队伍死心塌地为国民党效犬马之劳的时候，蒋介石召开衡山军事会议，他们带着平剧团去“慰问演出”。湖北大溃退后，他们奉旨炮制捏造“战绩”、狂呼“蒋委员长万岁”的《胜利进行曲》。在这些背叛活动中，他们所接受的，难道不正是国民党的领导？！
    当毛主席教导我们坚持“统一战线中的独立自主”原则，既要“保持自己已经取得的阵地”，还要“发展阵地”的时候，也正是田汉等人把党所领导的一切文艺阵地都拱手让给国民党的时候，他们出谋划策，让国民党把十个演剧队改编为直接为反动派服务的御用工具。田汉甚至把自己最得意的学生和剧团，送到陈诚部下去当特务、去“剿匪”。在这些背叛活动中，他们所接受的，难道不正是国民党的领导？！
    一九四○年，蒋介石发动的第一次反共高潮引起了全国人民的公愤，田汉等人却在他们出版的《戏剧春秋》“发刊词”里说什么“曾记得南岳会议时我最高领袖基于第一期抗战所得血腥的经验而有‘政治重于军事’‘宣传重于作战’等贤明的决定，惜乎一年以来我们未能将当时的口号作迅速有效的实践，致使我们有许多缺点原封未动，或且更加发展起来。此真上无以对领袖下无以对天下后世的耻辱！”他们的“领袖”是蒋介石，而且是“最高”的，他们的党，难道不正是国民党吗？
    一九四四年初，国民党为了在战后实行“反共建国”方针而进行精神动员和舆论准备，特地出钱出力，由田汉、夏衍之流出面举行了西南第一届戏剧展览会。会上，蒋匪军政要员陈诚，白崇禧，黄旭初，张道藩等或幕后操纵，或亲临“训示”，向大会提出：
    一、“戏剧主义化”。即三民主义化，“戏剧节正是创造三民主义戏剧的日子。”
    二、“戏剧教育化”。“剧本应适应抗战建国之需要，不能离开宣传教育。”
    三、“剧人思想应以三民主义为依据”。要以蒋介石的《中国之命运》作为一切工作的最高指针和言行的最高准绳。
    这明明是国民党给田汉之流立下的“卖身契”、“招降书”，然而，田汉之流竟然心甘情愿卖身投靠，按照主子意图，一丝不苟地照办。他们表示要利用戏剧来为国民党推行的投降反共政策作“再动员，更彻底的动员”。他们把蒋介石的“从抗战中建国”的口号原封不动地搬到戏剧运动中来，号召广大的戏剧工作者为此贡献“一切智慧，一切才能，甚至我们的血”。这真是对党所领导的国统区戏剧运动，从政治、思想到组织的一个全面的大拍卖，大背叛，大投降！是田汉之流一贯背离党的领导，实行投降主义政策的一次最集中的大暴露！他们所说的“党的领导”，究竟是哪个“党的领导”，不就昭然若揭了吗？
                   两次翻案　一股妖风
      “国防戏剧”是王明右倾机会主义的产物。当时，鲁迅就曾对它进行过批判。以后，又受到毛主席的多次严厉的批判。毛主席在《新民主主义论》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》这两部划时代的光辉著作中，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批判了周扬为代表的资产阶级文艺路线，宣告了“国防文学”、“国防戏剧”等口号的彻底破产。
    但是，周扬一伙对毛主席的批判阳奉阴违，伺机翻案。建国以后，在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，他们利用所窃踞的职位和权力，掀起了两次大规模的为“国防文学”口号翻案和复活“国防戏剧”的逆流。
    一次是从一九五六年到一九五八年。先是周扬跳出来鼓吹三十年代文艺已经与无产阶级结合，形成了“表现人民斗争”的传统，“今天的文艺工作者都是由这个传统抚育出来的”。以后，他们又通过《鲁迅全集》的一条注释，《文艺战线上的一场大辩论》一篇文章和吹捧这篇文章的一个座谈会，以篡改和伪造历史的卑劣手法，攻击鲁迅，把“国防文学”这个资产阶级口号装饰成无产阶级文学主张。戏剧界的“祖师爷”、“老头子”田汉、夏衍、阳翰笙等则紧密配合，在一九五七年初抛出《举办话剧运动五十年纪念及搜集整理话剧运动史料、出版话剧史料集的建议》，叫嚷要以过去戏剧的“经验”和“传统”来“纠正”社会主义“话剧运动的重要时弊”。这是一篇反攻倒算的宣言书，是反党反社会主义的开场锣鼓。当资产阶级右派和牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，向党向社会主义猖狂进攻时，田汉之流则推波助澜，密切呼应，写文章，开纪念会，举办展览，上演三十年代剧目，为“国防戏剧”招魂，对毛主席的革命文艺路线进行大反扑、大进攻。
    一次是从一九六○年到一九六二年。周扬一伙利用“左联”成立三十周年和《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的纪念活动，利用拍摄电影《鲁迅传》和编写《中国现代文学史》的机会，继续污蔑鲁迅，为“国防文学”口号涂脂抹粉，向毛主席革命文艺路线发射毒箭。田汉抛出反党纲领《要总结一下民主革命阶段的戏剧经验》，并在广州召开的“全国话剧、歌剧、儿童剧创作座谈会”上，伙同其他牛鬼蛇神一起“泄怨气”、“吐苦水”，疯狂反党反社会主义，为复活“国防戏剧”奔走呼号。
    周扬、田汉、夏衍一伙所以不遗余力地鼓吹和复活所谓三十年代文艺，其目的，一方面，妄图以三十年代资产阶级文艺路线来代替毛主席的无产阶级文艺路线，篡改文艺为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的正确方向。另一方面，妄图以此作为政治资本，为自己树碑立传，巩固他们在文艺界的统治霸权，代替党和毛泽东思想对文艺的领导。这一切的最终目的，是为了对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，把文艺变成复辟资本主义的舆论工具，以便颠覆无产阶级专政，使整个中国改变颜色。
    一声霹雳，妖魔丧胆。一九六六年春，《林彪同志委托江青同志召开的部队文艺工作座谈会纪要》，彻底粉碎了周扬一伙复活三十年代文艺和“国防戏剧”的阴谋。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，不仅把周扬等反革命修正主义分子揪了出来，而且揪出了文艺黑线的总后台，把什么“国防文学”、“国防戏剧”统统扔进了历史的垃圾堆。正是：
    “借问瘟君欲何往，纸船明烛照天烧。”
