The full text of the statement is as follows:

	Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought Will Triumph! Modern Revisionism Will Be Defeated!

	(Statement by the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party on the 50th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution)

		(1)

	Long Live the Great October Revolution!

	On November 7, 1917, the proletarian dictatorship was established in Russia, becoming a beacon for the oppressed peoples of the world.

	This is a great victory for the heroic Russian people, a great victory won by the working class under the leadership of the great Lenin and the Bolsheviks.

	The Great October Revolution shook the world. It showed the oppressed peoples of the world the path to liberation. It taught people through practice that the oppressed peoples can only use violence to overthrow the violent rule of the exploiting classes and achieve victory.

	Long Live the Great October Revolution!

	Long Live the Heroic Soviet People!

	We pay our most sincere red salute to the glorious Communist Party of the Soviet Union led by Lenin and Stalin in their time!

		(2)

	Down with the Revisionist Clique Centered Around the Traitor Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin!

	Today, the clique centered around the traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin has destroyed the great victory of the October Revolution, which belongs to the Soviet people and the people of the world. They have destroyed the proletarian dictatorship established by the heroic Soviet people through bloody struggles. They are pushing capitalism under the guise of Marxism-Leninism. This gang of traitors is also destroying the revolutions of the proletariat and oppressed classes in various countries.

	This gang of traitors denies this universal truth of Marxism-Leninism: that the bourgeois state cannot be replaced by the proletarian state (proletarian dictatorship) through "self-dissolution." According to the general law, it can only be achieved through violent revolution. They attempt to replace this universal truth with parliamentary methods. They are doing their utmost to lull the revolutionary will of the people of the world and maintain the power of all reactionaries.

	The heroic Soviet people will never tolerate this gang of traitors carrying out their shameful schemes of taking the capitalist road under the guise of Marxism-Leninism. They will unite with the proletariat of the world to fight against this gang of traitors and achieve victory.

	Down with the Modern Revisionist Clique of the Traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin!

		(3)

	Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Led by Chairman Mao!

	Just as the revisionist clique centered around the traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin is using cunning and deceitful means to destroy Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party of China, with Chairman Mao Zedong at the helm, is resolutely defending Marxism-Leninism.

	Practice has shown that the great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism.

	Therefore, the center of the international proletariat has shifted from Moscow to Beijing.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has developed the Marxist-Leninist theory of carrying the socialist revolution through to the end and further consolidating the proletarian dictatorship under the conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, raising Marxism-Leninism to a new stage.

	The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao has added immense strength to the revolutions of the world.

	Long Live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which has made tremendous contributions to the proletariat and oppressed classes of the world!

	Long Live the vanguard of the international proletariat—the Communist Party of China, led by Chairman Mao Zedong!

	Long Live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

	Long Live our beloved Chairman Mao Zedong!

		(4)

	The People's Democratic Revolution in Burma Will Triumph!

	We, the members of the Burmese Communist Party, the soldiers of the People's Army, the guerrilla fighters, the militiamen, and all those who seek liberation, will, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Great October Revolution, further study and apply Marxism-Leninism.

	We will, with boundless love and trust, further study and apply the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—the great Mao Zedong Thought.

	We will unite closely with the great Communist Party of China, the glorious Party of Labor of Albania, and the Marxist-Leninist parties and proletariat of various countries to thoroughly defeat the revisionist clique of the traitors Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin.

	We will thoroughly defeat the traitors and imperialists who support the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma—Ne Win, the traitor. We will establish a people's democratic state in Burma that solves all fundamental problems of the current stage according to the strong will of the Burmese people.

	We sincerely and warmly celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Great October Revolution.

	Long Live the Great October Revolution!

	Long Live the Great Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

	Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party
	October 24, 1967

    马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想必胜！现代修正主义必败！
      （缅共中央关于伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年的声明）
                  （一）
    伟大的十月革命万岁
    一九一七年十一月七日，在俄国建立了无产阶级专政，并成为世界被压迫人民的灯塔。
    这是英雄的俄国人民的伟大胜利，是工人阶级在伟大列宁为首的布尔什维克党领导下冲锋陷阵取得的伟大胜利。
    伟大的十月革命震撼了全世界。它给全世界被压迫人民指明了争取解放的道路。它以实践教导了人们：被压迫人民只能用暴力去对付和推翻剥削阶级的暴力统治，并取得胜利。
    伟大的十月革命万岁！
    英雄的苏联人民万岁！
    向伟大的列宁和斯大林亲自领导时期的、光荣的苏联共产党致以最诚挚的红色敬礼！
                  （二）
    打倒以叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金为中心的修正主义集团
    今天，以叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金为中心的集团已经破坏了属于苏联人民和全世界人民的伟大的十月革命胜利果实，破坏了英雄的苏联人民通过流血斗争建立起来的苏联无产阶级专政。他们披着马克思列宁主义外衣推行资本主义。这一伙叛徒还破坏了各国无产阶级和被压迫阶级的革命。
    这一伙叛徒否认马克思列宁主义的这一个普遍真理：资产阶级国家由无产阶级国家（无产阶级专政）代替是不能经过“自行消亡”来实现的，根据一般规律，只能靠暴力革命来实现。他们企图用议会方法来代替这个普遍真理。他们竭尽全力麻痹世界人民的革命意志，维护一切反动派的政权。
    英雄的苏联人民绝不会容忍这一伙叛徒在马克思列宁主义的伪装下进行走资本主义道路的卑鄙勾当。他们必将同全世界无产阶级团结起来，同这一伙叛徒进行斗争，并取得胜利。
    打倒叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金现代修正主义集团！
                  （三）
    毛主席领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁
    正当以叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金为中心的修正主义集团采取阴险狡猾的手段破坏马克思列宁主义的时候，以毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党坚决地捍卫了马克思列宁主义。
    实践表明，伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。
    因此，国际无产阶级的中心已经从莫斯科转移到了北京。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命，发展了马克思列宁主义关于在无产阶级专政条件下把社会主义革命进行到底和进一步巩固无产阶级专政的学说，把马克思列宁主义提高到了一个崭新的阶段。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命给世界各国革命增加了无比的力量。
    为世界各国无产阶级和被压迫阶级作出巨大贡献的伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    以毛泽东主席为首的国际无产阶级先锋队——中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们敬爱的毛泽东主席万岁！
                   （四）
    缅甸人民民主革命必胜
    我们缅甸共产党党员、人民军战士、游击队战士、民兵和一切要求解放的人们，为了纪念伟大的十月革命五十周年，一定要进一步活学活用马克思列宁主义。
    我们一定要以无限热爱、无限信赖的心情，进一步活学活用当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——伟大的毛泽东思想。
    我们要和伟大的中国共产党、光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党以及各国马克思列宁主义党和各国无产阶级兄弟紧密团结起来，彻底打倒叛徒赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金修正主义集团。
    我们一定要彻底打倒由这伙叛徒和帝国主义者所支持的缅甸的蒋介石——卖国贼奈温。我们一定要在缅甸建立一个按照缅甸人民的强烈愿望，解决缅甸现阶段一切基本问题的人民民主国家。
    我们衷心地、最热烈地祝贺伟大的十月革命五十周年。
    伟大的十月革命万岁！
    伟大的马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想万岁！
              缅甸共产党中央委员会　一九六七年十月二十四日
