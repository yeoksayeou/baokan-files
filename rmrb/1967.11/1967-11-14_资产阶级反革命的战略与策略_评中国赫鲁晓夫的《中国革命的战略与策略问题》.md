The strategic and tactical line of the bourgeois counterrevolutionaries: A critique of Liu Shaoqi's "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution"
Yan Changgui

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by our great leader Chairman Mao, the greatest capitalist-roader in the Party, Liu Shaoqi, has been exposed by the revolutionary masses as a notorious old revisionist, a traitor to the proletariat.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in leading the Chinese revolution, applied the Marxist-Leninist worldview to observe China's destiny and pointed out a truly liberating path of light for the Chinese people. In his series of brilliant works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," "The Spark Will Become a Prairie Fire," "Problems of Strategy in China's Revolutionary War," "On Protracted War," "The Communist," "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," and "On New Democracy," Chairman Mao scientifically, profoundly, and systematically analyzed the situation in Chinese society, elucidated the objects, tasks, forces, nature, methods, and future of the Chinese revolution, and brilliantly and creatively solved the problems of strategy and tactics in the Chinese revolution. This is the first time in Chinese history that such a strategic and tactical line has appeared, guiding the disaster-stricken Chinese people from one victory to another.

Since infiltrating the ranks of the Chinese revolution, Liu Shaoqi has always stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, catering to the needs of the Kuomintang reactionaries led by Chiang Kai-shek, and colluding with opportunists like Chen Duxiu and Wang Ming to peddle the revisionist nonsense of Bernstein, Kautsky, and others. He has maliciously opposed Chairman Mao's theories and strategies on the Chinese revolution, sabotaging the revolutionary movement of the Chinese people.

In 1942, the Chinese people's War of Resistance against Japan, due to the savage invasion of Japanese imperialism and the obstruction and sabotage by the Kuomintang reactionaries, entered an extremely arduous period. The indomitable Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, followed the strategic and tactical lines for the Chinese revolution formulated by Chairman Mao, fought bravely on one hand to resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism, and on the other hand to oppose the anti-communist and capitulationist activities of the Kuomintang reactionaries. It was at this time that Liu Shaoqi went around giving speeches and published an article titled "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution." This is Liu Shaoqi's representative work during the period of the democratic revolution. In this poisonous weed, he strenuously opposed the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, opposed the proletarian revolutionary line, and opposed Mao Zedong Thought. The so-called strategic and tactical lines for the Chinese revolution advocated by Liu Shaoqi are completely opposed to the strategic and tactical lines for the Chinese revolution formulated by Chairman Mao. They are the strategic and tactical lines of bourgeois counterrevolutionaries.

Who should lead the Chinese democratic revolution: the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? The Communist Party or the Kuomintang?

Who should lead the Chinese democratic revolution: the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? The Communist Party or the Kuomintang? On this issue of revolutionary leadership, the Marxist-Leninist line represented by Chairman Mao fundamentally differs from and sharply struggles against the opportunist and revisionist lines represented by Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and Liu Shaoqi.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "China urgently needs a bourgeois democratic revolution, and this revolution can only be completed under the leadership of the proletariat." He also said: "Should the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie, or should the bourgeoisie follow the proletariat? This question of the leadership of the Chinese revolution is the key to its success or failure." Chairman Mao, in leading the Chinese revolution, always firmly grasped this key issue of the revolution, ensuring that the leadership of the Chinese revolution was firmly in the hands of the proletariat and the Communist Party, thus guaranteeing the victory of the Chinese revolution.

However, Liu Shaoqi, on this key issue of the success or failure of the revolution, strenuously opposed the great Mao Zedong Thought. He used every means to deny and cancel the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party over the Chinese revolution and advocated handing over the leadership of the Chinese revolution to the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang.

As early as the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War, Liu Shaoqi, just like the right-opportunist leader Chen Duxiu within the Party, vehemently opposed the proletariat leading the revolution. He spoke in the same language as Chen Duxiu, slandering the Chinese working class as "immature" and cursing the Chinese working class as "immoral," saying that the Chinese workers, who "lack public morality," "still do not have the strength to carry out a social revolution," and shouting that the party that should bear the responsibility for the Chinese national revolution is the "Kuomintang." This fully shows that Liu Shaoqi has never been a Marxist but a class enemy who infiltrated the revolutionary ranks, a vicious enemy of the proletariat.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, Liu Shaoqi, this follower of Chen Duxiu, became a partner of the right-opportunist Wang Ming. He frantically opposed Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the United Front against Japanese Aggression, engaged in class capitulationism, and openly demanded that the Communist Party give up the leadership of the United Front and hand it over to the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no United Front against Japanese Aggression. In May 1937, before the United Front against Japanese Aggression had formed, our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Without the political leadership of the proletariat and its party, the United Front against Japanese Aggression cannot be established, the goal of peaceful and democratic resistance cannot be achieved, the motherland cannot be defended, and a united democratic republic cannot be successful." After the Kuomintang was forced to accept the proposal of the United Front against Japanese Aggression put forward by the Communist Party, in November 1937, our great leader Chairman Mao, in response to the capitulationist tendency that had emerged within the Party, once again sharply pointed out to the entire Party: "In the United Front, is it the proletariat leading the bourgeoisie, or the bourgeoisie leading the proletariat? Is it the Kuomintang attracting the Communist Party, or the Communist Party attracting the Kuomintang?" "The capitulationism of Chen Duxiu in 1927 led to the failure of the revolution at that time. Every Communist Party member should not forget this historical lesson of blood." "We must definitely implement the principle of 'independence within the United Front' and definitely overcome capitulationism or conciliationism."

Chairman Mao here criticized the representative figures of capitulationism within the Party, not only the notorious right-opportunist Wang Ming but also the old right-opportunist Liu Shaoqi.

In October 1937, it was precisely when Chairman Mao severely criticized the capitulationism within the Party that Liu Shaoqi shamelessly praised the reactionary leader of the Kuomintang, Yan Xishan, as a "leftist," saying: "We do not need to ask who the labor unions and peasant associations are led by," "even under the leadership of Yan Xishan and his leftists, it is very good."

In October 1942, four years after the Party's Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee had settled accounts with Wang Ming's capitulationist line, Liu Shaoqi still stubbornly adhered to the capitulationist line. In reports such as "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," he vigorously advocated that the "Three Principles of the People" Kuomintang is a flag with great significance, that Chiang Kai-shek is the leader of the war of resistance and national construction, that the Kuomintang is the most popular and legal organizational form of the United Front against Japanese Aggression, the best ready-made form, that the Communist Party can only participate in the United Front against Japanese Aggression led by the big bourgeoisie, that all armed forces must be "more closely united under the unified leadership of the central government," and so on. Look, in the eyes of this Liu Shaoqi, who wears the cloak of a Communist Party member, the Communist Party is merely an appendage of the Kuomintang.

Liu Shaoqi's set of fallacies is no different from Wang Ming's "everything for the United Front against Japanese Aggression, everything through the United Front against Japanese Aggression," "the Kuomintang is the largest party in China," "the Communist Party sincerely supports Chairman Chiang," and other shameless counterrevolutionary slogans. There is absolutely no difference.

It is worth noting that after Wang Ming's capitulationist line was completely bankrupt, when the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek was intensifying the wave of anti-communism, Liu Shaoqi still wanted to continue advocating this capitulationist line, still wanted to shout "Chiang Kai-shek is the leader of the war of resistance and national construction." This great betrayal and surrender is even more vicious and despicable! Liu Shaoqi is even more Wang Ming than Wang Ming!

To find a "theoretical" basis for his capitulationist line of surrendering the leadership of the revolution, Liu Shaoqi even went so far as to distort history and painstakingly beautify and praise the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek.

First, Liu Shaoqi said: "Whether the Kuomintang is in a revolutionary or counterrevolutionary period, the Kuomintang is an alliance of several classes. When the Kuomintang is revolutionary, the strength and role of workers, peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie within it are strengthened, and when the Kuomintang is counterrevolutionary, the strength and role of bureaucrats, compradors, and landlords are strengthened." He believed that "the big landlords and big bourgeoisie betrayed the revolution, but the Kuomintang did not necessarily have to betray the revolution." This is a distortion of history, a betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Is the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang an "alliance of classes" that includes workers and peasants? This is the theory of a traitor! Should workers and peasants still regard the counterrevolutionary Kuomintang as their party? Should workers and peasants still bow to the executioners who slaughter them and shout "long live"? Should workers and peasants still take responsibility for the traitors and sellouts of the nation?

What does "the big landlords and big bourgeoisie betrayed the revolution, but the Kuomintang did not necessarily have to betray the revolution" mean? Please ask Liu Shaoqi, what do you call the "April 12th Massacre" in 1927 if it is not the Kuomintang betraying the revolution? The Kuomintang's ten-year "encirclement and suppression" of the Communist Party, is that not enough betrayal?

In 1937, Chairman Mao pointed out in "On Contradiction": "During the First Revolutionary Civil War, the Kuomintang was an alliance of various classes for democratic revolution. After 1927, the Kuomintang changed to the opposite side, becoming a reactionary clique of landlords and big bourgeoisie." Liu Shaoqi, in direct opposition to Chairman Mao, insisted on describing the Kuomintang, which had already become a reactionary clique of landlords and big bourgeoisie, as an "alliance of several classes." Is this not a naked opposition to Mao Zedong Thought, a whitewashing of the Kuomintang?

Second, the so-called "the Kuomintang has great power." During the War of Resistance against Japan, some people, in response to the situation where the Kuomintang, in the face of the invasion of Japanese imperialism, lost territory and soldiers, lost their helmets and armor, disintegrated, and was corrupt and incompetent, believed that the Kuomintang was just an empty shell. This is a vivid saying that completely conforms to Chairman Mao's strategic thinking. However, this saying enraged Liu Shaoqi, who shouted angrily: "The Kuomintang has great power, and it can even be said that no other party in the world has such great power. It controls vast political power, has several million armed forces, and has a legal position in China and the world. These are real things, how can you say the Kuomintang is an empty shell?"

While Liu Shaoqi was doing everything he could to sing the praises of the Kuomintang, he was doing his utmost to denigrate the great Communist Party of China. He even distorted historical facts and said with his eyes wide open: "No matter how we prepare our counterattack forces," "in the overall force of our counterattack against the Japanese, we are still the smallest part," and "not the decisive force"!

The Kuomintang "has several million armed forces." This is a fact. However, as Chairman Mao said: "In name, there are three million soldiers, but in reality, their morale is extremely low, and some people compare them to a basket of eggs, which will collapse with a slight touch." Liu Shaoqi was terrified in front of the Kuomintang's several million counterrevolutionary armed forces, and therefore, at every opportunity, he bowed down to it in worship.

The Kuomintang "has a legal position in China and the world." This is the language of a complete servant of the Kuomintang, an insult to the great Chinese people. The people under the rule of the Kuomintang were struggling and fighting on the brink of death and had long seen through the savage nature of the Kuomintang reactionaries. What legal position does the Kuomintang have? This is not to make the Chinese people forever slaves under the rule of the Kuomintang?!

The Communist Party "in the overall force of our counterattack against the Japanese, is still the smallest part." This is a malicious distortion of historical facts, a shameful slander of the mainstay of the War of Resistance against Japan—the armed forces led by the Communist Party. Chairman Mao pointed out that from 1939 to 1943, "in these few years, there was no serious war on the Kuomintang front. The blade of the Japanese invaders was mainly directed at the liberated areas. By 1943, 64% of the invading Japanese army and 95% of the puppet army were resisted by the people and soldiers of the liberated areas; the Kuomintang front only bore 36% of the Japanese army and 5% of the puppet army." Liu Shaoqi, like all revisionists, spoke of revolutionary forces as worthless and blew up counterrevolutionary forces as godlike.

Third, Liu Shaoqi said: "Now (referring to 1942) the Chiang faction probably will not surrender," "the danger of large-scale surrender is probably not there," "Chiang is determined to resist the war to the end," "the entire Chinese nation has been resisting the war to the end and achieving final victory, and Chiang has merit." In Liu Shaoqi's view, the Chinese people should really erect a "memorial" for Chiang Kai-shek and give him the title of "national hero"!

Know that Liu Shaoqi's words were said in a letter to several responsible comrades of the New Fourth Army. The culprit of the "Anshan Incident," which massacred the anti-Japanese army, Chiang Kai-shek's blood debt has not been settled, and the blood of more than nine thousand New Fourth Army soldiers and fighters has not dried, but Liu Shaoqi was impatient to flatter this great executioner, to dress him up and sing his praises. Where is there any trace of a Communist Party member in this?

What merit does Chiang Kai-shek have? Chiang Kai-shek passively resisted Japan, "flirted with Japan's peace envoy," actively opposed communism, "the voices of limiting, dissolving, and opposing communism were heard throughout the country, and atrocities followed one after another, blood flowers flew everywhere." Is this not called surrender, but called "merit in resisting the war"? Chiang Kai-shek implemented fascist one-party rule, replaced the war of resistance with civil war, replaced independence with surrender, replaced unity with division, replaced light with darkness. Is Chiang Kai-shek not the culprit of surrender and treason, but a "meritorious" figure who "resisted the war to the end"? This is shameless to the extreme!

The strategy and tactics that Liu Shaoqi so vigorously advocates are completely the strategy and tactics of canceling the leadership of the Communist Party, the strategy and tactics of the Kuomintang, the strategy and tactics of bourgeois counterrevolutionaries!

Is the guiding ideology of the Chinese new democratic revolution communism or bourgeois democracy?

What is the guiding ideology of the Chinese new democratic revolution? Is it communism or bourgeois democracy? This is an important part of the struggle between the two lines within the Party. On this issue, just as on the issue of the leadership of the Chinese revolution, Liu Shaoqi completely exposed his nature of betraying the revolution and opposing Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao clearly and firmly pointed out: "The democratic revolution in China cannot succeed without the guidance of communism, let alone the later stage of the revolution." "Communism is the entire ideological system of the proletariat and at the same time a new social system. This ideological system and social system are distinct from any other ideological system and any other social system, and are the most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational since the beginning of human history. The feudal ideological system and social system have entered the historical museum. The capitalist ideological system and social system have already partially entered the museum (in the Soviet Union); the remaining part has also 'the sun is setting in the west, the breath is faint, the life is in danger, and one cannot see the morning.' It is about to enter the museum. Only the communist ideological system and social system are surging forward with the force of a mountain torrent and the power of thunder, preserving their youthful beauty."?

Liu Shaoqi, however, jumped out to sing a counterpoint to Chairman Mao. In "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," he insisted on describing the guiding ideology of the Chinese revolution as the "Three Principles of the People." He warned ominously: "I think the Chinese revolution can be carried out under the banner of the Kuomintang's Three Principles of the People, at least for the democratic revolution, it will be much smoother than using other banners."?

What "other banners"? It is the banner of communism. What "banner of the Three Principles of the People"? It is the banner of the bourgeoisie. Liu Shaoqi believed that the democratic revolution of a bourgeois nature can only be carried out under the guidance of bourgeois ideology. Therefore, he repeatedly advocated learning from the United States and France, saying that "we must conduct education on democracy within and outside the Party and among the people, and designate comrades to study bourgeois democracy during the period of the bourgeois revolution." At a glance, this is Liu Shaoqi's open challenge to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!

Can bourgeois democracy serve as the guiding ideology of the Chinese democratic revolution? It has been tried more than once, but it has always failed. "The invasion of imperialism shattered the Chinese people's dream of learning from the West." "Now the world relies on communism as a savior; now China is the same." "The October Revolution sent us Marxism-Leninism." The Chinese people only found the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, which is universally applicable, and mastered the theoretical weapon of scientific communism, making the face of the Chinese revolution completely renewed, developing from the old democratic revolution to the new democratic revolution, and moving from failure to victory. In the 1940s, after the publication of Chairman Mao's great work "On New Democracy," Liu Shaoqi still desperately opposed Marxism-Leninism, shouting loudly to learn from the West and advocating bourgeois democracy. This does not clearly show that he is a thoroughgoing reactionary who goes against the tide of the times and the needs of the people, a bourgeois reactionary?

Liu Shaoqi also said: "If it is said to implement the Three Principles of the People, people are not afraid, but if it is said to realize the minimum program of the Communist Party, people will be a bit afraid. In fact, the contents of these two are basically the same, so why don't we say to implement the Three Principles of the People, but insist on doing something else? This is on the one hand naivety, not understanding tactics, and on the other hand, not understanding strategy."

Who is "afraid" of "realizing the minimum program of the Communist Party" but "not afraid" of "implementing the Three Principles of the People"? Is it the vast number of Chinese workers and peasants? Of course not. Those who are afraid of the minimum program of the Communist Party can only be the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, who have been cursing communism as a "monster" since the beginning of its spread in China, shouting that "communism does not suit the national conditions of China." What class position does Liu Shaoqi stand on, and for what class does he speak? Is this not clear?

The so-called "why don't we say to implement the Three Principles of the People, but insist on doing something else," this extremely reactionary fallacy, is not Liu Shaoqi's new invention. It is just a piece of junk picked up from the propaganda machine of Chiang Kai-shek's counterrevolutionary propaganda.

Since the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, while intensifying military attacks on the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army, also launched a fierce attack on the Communist Party and Marxism-Leninism in the cultural and public opinion sphere. Chairman Mao described the situation at that time in "On New Democracy": Chiang Kai-shek "had already decided on his strategy, and the time was not right, so he hired a few metaphysical ghosts and a few Trotskyites, shook their pens and guns, and shouted and stabbed wildly." At that time, the stubborn bourgeoisie said that since you communists have pushed the socialist social system to a later stage, and you have also declared that "the Three Principles of the People are necessary for China today, and our Party is willing to struggle for their thorough realization," then you should put communism aside for the time being. Chairman Mao, in response to this fallacy, pointed out: "This argument, under the title of 'one ideology,' has already become arrogant shouts."

In December 1938, the metaphysical ghost Zhang Junmai, under the instructions of Chiang Kai-shek, published the infamous "Open Letter to Comrade Mao Zedong," saying that "I think that in the current stage, you should focus on the external national war and temporarily set aside Marxism."

Look, Zhang Junmai shouted that the Communist Party must "temporarily set aside Marxism," and Liu Shaoqi shouted that the Communist Party, except for the Three Principles of the People, should not "do something else." Is this not the same tune, the same kind? In the criminal activities of attacking Marxism-Leninism, Liu Shaoqi, together with Zhang Junmai and his ilk, became "brothers"!

Liu Shaoqi slandered those who insisted on using communism and Marxism-Leninism to guide the democratic revolution as "naive," as "not understanding tactics." Then, what kind of "tactics" is his "not doing something else"? It is the "tactics" of not wanting communism, not wanting Marxism-Leninism, the "tactics" of Chiang Kai-shek and Zhang Junmai. History has proven that anyone who promotes this set of counterrevolutionary tactics will become a criminal of history, a traitor to the proletariat.

Armed struggle or the "parliamentary road"?

Is the proletariat's seizure of power to be through violent revolution or the "parliamentary struggle"? This has always been an important issue in the sharp struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, between proletarian revolutionaries and all traitors to the proletariat.

Violent revolution is the only correct path for the proletariat to seize power, the universal law of proletarian revolution. Chairman Mao, based on the Marxist-Leninist principle of violent revolution, summarized the experience of the international proletarian revolution and the people's democratic revolution led by the Chinese proletariat, and proposed the famous dictum that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," creatively developing the Marxist-Leninist theory of violent revolution.

In 1938, Chairman Mao, in his concluding remarks at the Sixth Plenum of the Sixth Central Committee, said: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of guns; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be changed with guns."?

In 1939, Chairman Mao, in his article "The Communist," again admonished the entire Party: "In China, without armed struggle, the proletariat has no position, the people have no position, the Communist Party has no position, and there is no revolutionary victory. For eighteen years, the development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our Party have been carried out in revolutionary wars. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today. This experience bought with blood, all Party comrades should not forget."?

Armed struggle is the only path to the victory of the Chinese revolution. Liu Shaoqi, who has completely betrayed the revolution on the issues of revolutionary leadership and revolutionary guiding ideology, is even more frantic in opposing Mao Zedong Thought on the issue of armed struggle.

Liu Shaoqi, in his report "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," said: "In our ranks, there are also a few comrades who, with a few guns, think they are extraordinary and can 'seize the world.'" In a few words, he completely exposed his vicious attack on Chairman Mao's brilliant thought that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

To grasp the gun is an experience bought with the blood of the Chinese people. At that time, the Chinese people had already achieved great revolutionary victories with guns and were still using guns to resist the invasion of Japanese imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, shattering their dreams of destroying China and annihilating the Communist Party. Revolutionary people believed that only with guns could they "seize the world." Is this not an objective truth, but a crime?

Liu Shaoqi opposed using guns to "seize the world," so what does he want to use to "seize the world"? In the 1940s, he picked up the "parliamentary road" from the old revisionists of the Second International, who had been refuted by Lenin, as a "magic weapon" to "seize the world."

After the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, the Kuomintang, with the support of American imperialism, on the one hand, mobilized troops and prepared for civil war, and on the other hand, sang the high tune of peace and spread the smoke screen of peace. Our great commander Chairman Mao had a far-sighted vision and saw through the plot of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, timely warning the entire Party: "Absolutely do not hope that the Kuomintang will have a change of heart, it will not have a change of heart." "Now Chiang Kai-shek is sharpening his knife, so we must also sharpen our knife." However, Liu Shaoqi did not listen to Chairman Mao's warning at all. On the eve of the outbreak of the civil war, in early 1946, he proposed a set of fallacies about the so-called "new stage of peaceful democracy."

Liu Shaoqi said: "It is possible to achieve the success of the democratic revolution without going through a civil war. The basic success is through the constitution, the establishment of the parliament." "The main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary, legal mass struggle, and parliamentary struggle." "The entire work of the Party must be transformed, and all our organizations must change, transforming to non-armed struggle as the main form, adapting to the new situation." "All political problems must be solved peacefully, and in the future, the development of the Party will rely on our Party's ability to carry out legal mass struggle movements." "In Beijing and Tianjin, we have not entered with guns, but with parliamentary struggle, we can enter with votes."

Liu Shaoqi described the "parliamentary road" as if it were so wonderful! It is not to "seize the world" with guns, not to have everything from the barrel of a gun; it is to "seize the world" with votes, and with votes, everything is obtained. This is completely helping the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek to deceive the people.

To "seize the world" with guns or with votes, these are two diametrically opposed paths. The former is the path of Marxism-Leninism, the path of revolution, the path of victory, which is advocated and insisted on by our great leader Chairman Mao. The latter is the path of revisionism, the path of surrender, the path of failure, which is advocated and insisted on by Chen Duxiu, Wang Ming, and Liu Shaoqi and his ilk.

Lenin, when criticizing the Second International revisionists who opposed violent revolution and advocated the parliamentary road, pointed out: "Only a scoundrel or a fool would think that the proletariat should first obtain a majority through voting under the oppression of the bourgeoisie and the oppression of wage slavery and then seize power. This is the height of stupidity or the height of hypocrisy, this is to replace class struggle and revolution with voting under the old system and old power." Lenin said it so well! History shows: Liu Shaoqi is not a fool who is extremely stupid, but a scoundrel who is extremely hypocritical!

Liu Shaoqi is not only a "parliamentary fanatic" but also a "bureaucratic fanatic."

He boasted: "Our Party participates in the government council, various ministries, departments, and provincial governments, and we become a government party, not an opposition party but a ruling party, and some people will go to be officials, central government officials." He also said: "We participate in the government, and the twenty million US dollars borrowed from the United States will come." With officials to serve and money to spend, in Liu Shaoqi's view, this is a "profitable" deal! He was so eager for this deal to be sealed, so that he could take office early!

What "the Communist Party will become a government party, not an opposition party but a ruling party"? This is the language of Kautsky and his ilk. Liu Shaoqi's infatuation with the fantasy of the "parliamentary road," his opposition to the proletariat's armed seizure of power, his so-called "government party," is to turn the Communist Party into a parliamentary party, into an appendage of the Kuomintang, into a screen to cover up the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie.

What "some people will go to be officials, central government officials"? This is the language of the imperialist Hurley. Wasn't there an American reporter who said to our great leader Chairman Mao: "You should listen to Hurley's words and send a few people to the Kuomintang government to be officials"? Chairman Mao retorted: "It is not good to be an official with tied hands and feet, we will not do it. If we are to be officials, we must be free and unrestrained, this is to establish a united government on the basis of democracy." History has proven that the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek will never agree to this condition. They cling to one-party rule and fascist dictatorship. Liu Shaoqi, however, wants Communist Party members to unconditionally go to the Kuomintang government to be officials. This is completely in line with the needs of the Kuomintang reactionaries' "limiting, dissolving, and opposing communism," helping American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries to annihilate the Communist Party.

What conditions are there for the Communist Party to obtain a "legal" position in the Kuomintang government and go to the Kuomintang government to be officials? There are! This is what Chiang Kai-shek has been saying: "The Communist Party must hand over its army to have a legal position." Liu Shaoqi, obeying Chiang Kai-shek's orders, quickly replied: "Good, good!" "Our army will become the national army, national defense army, security forces, self-defense forces, the party branches, party committees, and political commissars of our army will be abolished, and the party organization will be abolished in the army." "All parties will stop direct leadership and command of the army, and will be unified under the Ministry of Defense." Liu Shaoqi, to be able to mix in the Kuomintang government for a position, wanted to hand over the then one million two hundred thousand troops and two million militia armed forces led by the Communist Party to the Kuomintang. This great sellout of the interests of the Chinese people, how poisonous it is!

The armed forces and armed forces built by the Chinese people in more than twenty years of brutal struggle are the lifeblood of the revolutionary people. Our great leader Chairman Mao, on behalf of the broad masses of the Chinese people, solemnly declared: "The people's armed forces, a gun, a bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over." Liu Shaoqi's wishful thinking was shattered.

Liu Shaoqi's action of handing over the people's armed forces to the Kuomintang is not isolated. This is a reflection of the international capitulationist trend within the Party. During the Second World War and after the Second World War, with the compromises between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union on some international issues, the traitors to the proletariat, such as Browder, Thorez, and Togliatti, in the international communist movement, vigorously spread the capitulationist trend and implemented the capitulationist line. Browder frantically advocated the dissolution of the American Communist Party, and Thorez and Togliatti, in exchange for a few seats in parliament, a few ministerial and vice-premier positions, handed over the armed forces led by the Communist Party to the bourgeois government. Their capitulationist fallacies and actions influenced many places in the world, seriously undermining the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. Our great leader Chairman Mao firmly resisted this rampant reactionary current, sharply criticized this international capitulationist trend. In the "Several Estimates of the Current International Situation" written in April 1946, he pointed out: "The compromise between the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is only the result of the firm and effective struggle of all democratic forces in the world against the reactionary forces of the United States, Britain, and France. This compromise does not require the peoples of the capitalist world to implement domestic compromise. The peoples of various countries will still carry out different struggles according to different situations. The principle of the reactionary forces against the democratic forces of the people is to annihilate them if they can, and to prepare to annihilate them if they cannot. In response to this situation, the democratic forces of the people should also adopt the same principle against the reactionary forces." This was the most correct, most brilliant, and most great thought at that time! This is the fundamental principle that has always guided the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world!

The leaders of the French Communist Party and the Italian Communist Party handed over their armed forces, and what was the result? The result was that they were kicked out by the bourgeoisie, and everything was in vain. The armed forces were handed over, and the "legal" position was also canceled. The victory fruits obtained by the proletariat and other laboring people in the anti-fascist war were completely seized by the bourgeoisie. The leadership of these two communist parties also became a revisionist group. It can be said that if Liu Shaoqi's absurd proposals had been realized, China would have suffered even more disastrously than the French and Italian communist parties: millions of heads would fall, and everything, whether parliament, constitution, or big officials of the Communist Party in the Kuomintang government, would be swept away in one morning.

It is very clear: Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of the so-called "new stage of peaceful democracy" is completely, following Chen Duxiu and Wang Ming, pushing the Chinese revolution to a "new stage" of party annihilation and beheading!

Is it to oppose the fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang, or to oppose the democratic government of the anti-Japanese base areas?

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for the seizure of power and the consolidation of power." The strategic and tactical focus of the Communist Party in the period of the democratic revolution is to overthrow the fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang and establish a joint dictatorship of all revolutionary classes led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. This is the basic program of the Party Central Committee led by our great leader Chairman Mao on the new democratic revolution in China. The strategic and tactical focus of Liu Shaoqi's counterrevolutionary line is to maintain the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie of the Kuomintang and oppose the establishment of a joint dictatorship of all revolutionary classes led by the proletariat and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.

In the process of the Chinese democratic revolution, there have long been two kinds of power. One is the fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, and the other is the joint dictatorship of all revolutionary classes led by the Communist Party in the base areas. The former is the object of the revolution, and the latter is the prototype and hope of New China. How to deal with the reactionary government of the Kuomintang and the people's democratic government in the base areas is a touchstone to test whether it is true revolution or counterrevolution.

During the War of Resistance against Japan, to completely defeat Japanese imperialism and to establish a people's republic, our great leader Chairman Mao led the Chinese people to develop and consolidate the democratic government of the anti-Japanese base areas, opposed the dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie of the Kuomintang, and carried out an arduous struggle. Chairman Mao, in response to the fascist dictatorship of the Kuomintang, proposed the great strategic line of "abolishing one-party dictatorship and implementing democratic politics." He pointed out: "It is necessary to change the reactionary one-party and one-class dictatorship of the Kuomintang in the political system to a democratic political system of cooperation among various parties and classes." Without this, "it would not be possible to mobilize the people to enter the war of resistance and achieve the victory of defending the motherland and recovering lost territory." Chairman Mao also severely denounced the Kuomintang's counterrevolutionary call to "abolish the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," saying: "The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region is the most progressive place in China. Here is the democratic anti-Japanese base area." "Why abolish it? Only shameless people can say such shameless words. What qualifications do the diehards have to hum in front of us? Comrades, of course, it cannot be like this. It is not to abolish the border region, but for the whole country to learn from the border region."

However, Liu Shaoqi went completely in the opposite direction. In the midst of the Kuomintang's frenzied calls to "abolish the Communist Party," "abolish the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army," and "abolish the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region," Liu Shaoqi took to the field! He not only fervently supported the Kuomintang's "one-party dictatorship," cheering and shouting, but also openly faced the Chiang family dynasty, waving the banner of "thoroughly reforming the power structure within the base areas." This is a counterrevolutionary banner of complete betrayal of the Chinese revolution and complete betrayal of the interests of the proletariat.

What does Liu Shaoqi mean by "thoroughly reforming the power structure within the base areas"? Look at his strange words below: "The reform of the power structure within the base areas is not just a change of a few people, but a reform of various systems of the power structure, and a reform of the national system and the political system." Again, it is a "reform of various systems," again, it is a "reform of the national system and the political system," how thorough, how resolute!

What is called "national system" and "political system"? Chairman Mao pointed out in "On New Democracy": "The so-called national system problem is the question of the position of various classes in the state." "The so-called 'political system' problem is the question of the form of the composition of political power, that is, the question of how a certain social class takes a certain form to organize its political power organs to oppose the enemy and protect itself." "National system" and "political system" are the most fundamental systems in the state. Liu Shaoqi wants to "thoroughly reform" the "national system" and "political system" of the power structure in the base areas, which is to grasp the essence.

What is the "national system" and "political system" of our anti-Japanese base areas' power? The power of the anti-Japanese base areas is the power of the United Front against Japanese Aggression, the power of the "three-thirds system." On March 6, 1940, Chairman Mao, in a directive written by the Central Committee for the Party, pointed out: "According to the principle of the United Front against Japanese Aggression, in the allocation of personnel, it should be stipulated that Communist Party members account for one-third, non-Party leftist progressives account for one-third, and non-leftist and non-rightist centrists account for one-third." Chairman Mao also emphasized: "It is necessary to ensure that Communist Party members hold a leading position in the power structure." Here, it is stipulated that Communist Party members account for one-third in the allocation of personnel and hold a leading position in the power structure, which is the most fundamental and important, it is the mark and soul of the democratic power of the anti-Japanese base areas.

Liu Shaoqi's so-called "reform" of the "national system" and "political system" of the power structure in the base areas is to oppose and abolish the revolutionary "three-thirds system," to oppose and abolish the leadership of the Party, to dig out the mark and soul of the anti-Japanese democratic power. He viciously said: the "three-thirds system" is "not a legal provision. Therefore, in any law, there should not be a provision for the 'three-thirds system.'" "We have no right to require that in any government agency, Communist Party members must account for one-third." "Similarly, in the law, it is also not possible to stipulate that any person in the government has a dominant position and a leading position."

Liu Shaoqi kept talking about "law" on the left and "law" on the right, as if he were the most brilliant "legal expert" in the world! Do you want to establish a "three-thirds system" power structure in the base areas where Communist Party members account for one-third? Do you want to stipulate that the Communist Party holds a leading position in the power structure of the base areas? In the eyes of Liu Shaoqi, this "judge," that is a violation of "law," and a violation of "any law." What "any law"? It is not the law of the proletariat, but the law of the landlords and bourgeoisie; it is not the law of the Communist Party, but the law of the Kuomintang. Is it possible to establish a "three-thirds system" power structure led by the Communist Party and violate the law of the proletariat? Obviously, the "law" in Liu Shaoqi's mouth is not anything else, but the law of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, that is, the law of the Kuomintang. According to the law of the Kuomintang, the "three-thirds system" power structure led by the Communist Party is of course not "legal," not only not "legal," but should be thrown into the eighteenth layer of hell! Liu Shaoqi, to oppose and abolish the "three-thirds system" power structure led by the Communist Party, actually raised the rotten spirit tablet of the Kuomintang's law, his counterrevolutionary face is not exposed completely?

Since the leading position of the Communist Party in the anti-Japanese democratic power structure "cannot be stipulated," then what should the Communist Party members do? Liu Shaoqi replied: in the "power structure," engage in "legal struggle." He said: "All Communist Party members must study and learn the tactics of legal struggle with all their hearts, after the implementation of the 'three-thirds system,' the struggle within the power structure has not stopped, but has only changed its form, the leading position of Communist Party members in the government can only be maintained and consolidated through legal struggle."

It is indeed wonderful! The leading position of the Communist Party in the "three-thirds system" power structure cannot be stipulated, but can only be "obtained" through "legal struggle," this is Liu Shaoqi's logic. This is completely the logic of canceling the leadership of the Communist Party, the logic of a traitor.

Liu Shaoqi's strange talk of Communist Party members learning legal struggle tactics within their own led government completely exposed his evil purpose of transforming our anti-Japanese base areas' democratic power into a bourgeois parliamentary system. Liu Shaoqi not only wanted Communist Party members to engage in parliamentary struggle in the Kuomintang government but also wanted them to engage in parliamentary struggle within their own led government. How absurd it is! Who says Liu Shaoqi has no "inventions"? This is his "invention"? Who says Liu Shaoqi has no "creations"? This is the creation of a new world record of the "parliamentary road"? Liu Shaoqi is more of a parliamentary fanatic than any parliamentary fanatic in the world. He is a double parliamentary fanatic! In front of this double parliamentary fanatic, the old ancestors of the parliamentary fanatics and their disciples, such as Bernstein, Kautsky, Togliatti, and Thorez, are all far behind, looking up to him!

Liu Shaoqi vigorously advocated the fallacy of "thoroughly reforming the power structure within the base areas," completely based on the needs of the Kuomintang's "one-party dictatorship," attempting to fundamentally change the nature of the anti-Japanese democratic power, in order to unify with Chiang Kai-shek, to unify with the Kuomintang's dictatorship of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie. Look at his confession: "The anti-Japanese democratic power is only a local government. It should belong to the central government, be led by the central government, and execute the laws of the central government according to the situation behind the enemy lines." Liu Shaoqi was so submissive to the Kuomintang's central government, truly a "tame tool"! He regarded the Kuomintang's central government as the "emperor above the emperor," and willingly became the "son of the emperor," this completely exposed Liu Shaoqi as a big landlord and big bourgeoisie agent who infiltrated our Party.

From being the "son of the emperor" (the so-called anti-Japanese democratic power belongs to the Kuomintang's central government and is led by the central government) to being the "second minister" (the so-called going to the Kuomintang's central government to be an official), this is Liu Shaoqi's basic idea in the period of the democratic revolution, this is the essence and core of Liu Shaoqi's so-called "strategy and tactics of the Chinese revolution."

From canceling the leadership of the Communist Party, handing over the leadership of the democratic revolution to the bourgeoisie Kuomintang, to opposing Marxism-Leninism and communism, advocating the outdated reactionary bourgeois democracy, to opposing armed struggle, advocating the "parliamentary road," to maintaining the Kuomintang's one-party dictatorship, opposing the democratic power of the base areas, this is Liu Shaoqi's so-called "strategy and tactics of the Chinese revolution." This is completely opposed to the general line of the new democratic revolution formulated by our great leader Chairman Mao. This is a set of thoroughgoing bourgeois counterrevolutionary strategy and tactics! This is a line of unadulterated counterrevolutionary revisionism!

In the report "Problems of Strategy and Tactics in the Chinese Revolution," Liu Shaoqi claimed to be a "complete Marxist." The cruel history shows: he is not a "complete Marxist" at all, but a complete opportunist and revisionist! He is the culmination of all opportunism and revisionism at home and abroad, the greatest counterrevolutionary revisionist in the contemporary world!

"Sweep away all harmful insects, no enemies." Now, Liu Shaoqi has completely fallen into the vast sea of revolutionary criticism, completely perished, this is his fate, this is the judgment of history!

    资产阶级反革命的战略与策略
    ——评中国赫鲁晓夫的《中国革命的战略与策略问题》
    阎长贵
    我们认为革命无产阶级的独立的、毫不妥协的马克思主义政党，是社会主义胜利的唯一保证，是走向胜利的康庄大道。
        列宁：《关于起义的战斗协议》资产阶级反革命的战略与策略——评中国赫鲁晓夫的《中国革命的战略与策略问题》阎　长　贵
    在我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，被革命群众揭露出来的党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，是中国的赫鲁晓夫，是罪恶累累的老修正主义分子，是无产阶级的叛徒。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在领导中国革命的过程中，运用马克思列宁主义的宇宙观，观察中国的命运，给中国人民指出了一条真正求解放的光明大道。毛主席在他的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《湖南农民运动考察报告》、《星星之火，可以燎原》、《中国革命战争的战略问题》、《论持久战》、《〈共产党人〉发刊词》、《中国革命和中国共产党》、《新民主主义论》等一系列光辉著作中，科学地、深刻地、系统地分析了中国社会的状况，阐明了中国革命的对象、任务、动力、性质、方法和前途，天才地、创造性地解决了中国革命的战略和策略问题。这是中国历史上破天荒第一次出现的、引导灾难深重的中国人民从一个胜利走向又一个胜利的战略和策略。
    中国赫鲁晓夫从混入中国革命队伍以后，始终站在资产阶级反动立场上，适应蒋介石国民党反动派的需要，和陈独秀、王明等机会主义分子相勾结，大肆贩卖伯恩斯坦、考茨基之流的修正主义谬论，丧心病狂地反对我们伟大领袖毛主席关于中国革命的理论和策略，破坏中国人民的革命运动。
    一九四二年，中国人民的抗日战争，由于日本帝国主义的野蛮侵略和国民党反动派的阻挠破坏，进入了极其艰苦的年代。不屈不挠的中国人民在共产党和毛主席的领导下，按照毛主席制定的中国革命的战略和策略，英勇奋战，一方面抗击日本帝国主义的侵略，一方面反对国民党反动派的反共投降活动。正是在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫到处作报告，抛出了一篇《中国革命的战略与策略问题》。这是中国赫鲁晓夫在民主革命时期的一篇代表作。他在这篇大毒草中，竭力反对以毛主席为首的党中央，反对无产阶级革命路线，反对毛泽东思想。中国赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的所谓中国革命的战略与策略，完全是和毛主席制定的中国革命的战略与策略根本对立的资产阶级反革命的战略与策略。
    中国民主革命的领导是无产阶级还是资产阶级？是共产党还是国民党？
    中国的民主革命由谁来领导？是无产阶级还是资产阶级？是共产党还是国民党？在这个革命的领导权问题上，以毛主席为代表的马克思列宁主义路线，同以陈独秀、王明、中国赫鲁晓夫为代表的机会主义、修正主义路线存在着根本的分歧和尖锐的斗争。
    毛主席指出：“中国迫切需要一个资产阶级的民主革命，这个革命必须由无产阶级领导才能完成。”①又说：“使无产阶级跟随资产阶级呢，还是使资产阶级跟随无产阶级呢？这个中国革命领导责任的问题，乃是革命成败的关键。”②毛主席在领导中国革命的过程中，一直紧紧地抓住这个革命的关键问题，使中国革命的领导权牢牢掌握在无产阶级和共产党手里，从而保证了中国革命的胜利。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫在这个革命成败的关键问题上，竭力反对伟大的毛泽东思想。他千方百计地否认和取消无产阶级和共产党对中国革命的领导权，而主张把中国革命的领导权交给资产阶级和国民党。
    早在第一次国内革命战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫就同党内右倾机会主义的头子陈独秀一模一样，极力反对无产阶级领导革命。他操着同陈独秀一样的语言，污蔑中国工人阶级“幼稚”，咒骂中国工人阶级“缺德”，说什么“素无公德心”的中国工人“还没有实力举行社会革命”，叫喊“担负中国国民革命的政党”只能是“中国国民党”。③这就充分说明中国赫鲁晓夫从来不是一个马克思主义者，而是一个混入革命队伍的阶级异己分子，无产阶级的凶恶敌人。
    抗日战争时期，中国赫鲁晓夫这个陈独秀的追随者，又变成了右倾机会主义分子王明的同伙。他疯狂地反对毛主席关于抗日民族统一战线的光辉思想，大搞阶级投降主义，公然要共产党放弃对统一战线的领导权，而把它送给国民党反动派。
    没有中国共产党的领导，就没有抗日民族统一战线。一九三七年五月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席在抗日民族统一战线还没有形成的时候，就指出：“离开了无产阶级及其政党的政治领导，抗日民族统一战线就不能建立，和平民主抗战的目的就不能实现，祖国就不能保卫，统一的民主共和国就不能成功。”④在国民党被迫接受了中国共产党提出的抗日民族统一战线主张以后，一九三七年十一月，我们伟大的领袖毛主席针对党内出现的投降主义倾向又一次向全党同志尖锐地指出：“在统一战线中，是无产阶级领导资产阶级呢，还是资产阶级领导无产阶级？是国民党吸引共产党呢，还是共产党吸引国民党？”“一九二七年陈独秀的投降主义，引导了那时的革命归于失败。每个共产党员都不应忘记这个历史上的血的教训。”⑤“一定要实行
  ‘统一战线中的独立自主’这个原则，一定要克服投降主义或迁就主义。”⑥
    毛主席在这里批判的党内投降主义的代表人物，不仅是臭名昭著的右倾机会主义分子王明，也是老牌的右倾机会主义分子中国赫鲁晓夫。
    一九三七年十月，正是在毛主席严厉批判党内的投降主义的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫公然无耻地吹捧国民党的反动头目阎锡山是什么“左派”，说：“我们现在不必问工会农会组织起来，是在谁的领导之下”，“即使在阎锡山及其左派领导之下，也是很好的”。⑦
    一九四二年十月，也就是在党的六届六中全会清算了王明的投降主义路线四年以后，中国赫鲁晓夫仍然顽固地坚持投降主义路线。他在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》之类的报告中，大肆宣扬什么“三民主义国民党是一面具有大作用的旗帜”，什么“蒋介石是抗战建国的领导者”，什么国民党是“抗日民族统一战线最通俗的、合法的组织形式，最好的现成的形式”⑧，什么共产党只能参加“以大资产阶级为领导的抗日统一战线”⑨，什么中国的一切武装必须“更加紧密地团结在中央政府的统一领导之下”⑩，等等。请看，在这个披着共产党员外衣的中国赫鲁晓夫眼里，共产党只不过是国民党的附属品。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的这套谬论同王明的什么“一切为着抗日民族统一战线，一切经过抗日民族统一战线”，什么“国民党是中国第一大党”，什么“中国共产党诚心诚意地拥护蒋委员长”?，等等无耻的反革命论调有什么区别呢？丝毫也没有。
    值得注意的是，在王明的投降主义路线彻底破产以后，在蒋介石国民党加紧发动反共高潮的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫还要继续宣扬这套投降主义路线，还要高呼“蒋介石是抗战建国的领导者”，这种大叛卖、大投降，就更加恶毒、更加卑鄙！中国的赫鲁晓夫比王明还王明！
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了替他的出卖革命领导权的投降主义路线寻找“理论”根据，还不惜歪曲历史，煞费苦心地美化和吹捧蒋介石国民党。
    其一，中国赫鲁晓夫说：“无论国民党是在革命或反革命时，国民党都是几个阶级联盟。当国民党革命时，工人、农民、小资产阶级在其中的力量和作用加强，当国民党反革命时，官僚、买办、地主的力量和作用加强。”他认为，“大地主、大资产阶级叛变革命，国民党并不一定要叛变革命”。?这是对历史的歪曲，是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的背叛。
    反革命的国民党是包括工人、农民的“阶级联盟”吗？这是十足的叛徒“理论”！难道工人、农民还要把反革命的国民党看作是自己的政党？难道工人、农民还要向屠杀他们的刽子手拱手作揖，高呼“万岁”？难道工人、农民还要替投降卖国的民族败类承担罪责？
    什么“大地主、大资产阶级叛变革命，国民党并不一定要叛变革命”，这真是一大“发明”！请问中国赫鲁晓夫，一九二七年“四一二”大屠杀，不叫做国民党叛变革命叫做什么？蒋介石国民党对共产党进行了十年的反革命“围剿”，你还嫌叛变得不够吗？
    一九三七年，毛主席在《矛盾论》中明确指出：国民党在第一次国内革命战争时期，“它是各阶级的民主革命的联盟。一九二七年以后，国民党变到了与此相反的方面，成了地主和大资产阶级的反动集团。”?中国赫鲁晓夫同毛主席大唱反调，硬把已经成为地主和大资产阶级反动集团的国民党说成是“几个阶级的联盟”，这不是赤裸裸地反对毛泽东思想，为国民党涂脂抹粉吗？
    其二，所谓国民党“有很大的力量”。在抗日战争时期，有人针对国民党在日本帝国主义侵略面前，丧土失地，丢盔弃甲，溃不成军，腐败无能的情况，认为国民党不过是一个空架子。这完全是符合毛主席战略思想的一个形象说法。然而这个说法却触怒了中国赫鲁晓夫，他气急败坏地叫嚷：国民党“有很大的力量，甚至可以说世界上没有任何一个党有它这样大的权力，它掌握有广大的政权，拥有几百万武装，在中国人民和世界上具有合法的地位。这些都是实际的东西，怎能说国民党是空架子呢？”?  
    中国赫鲁晓夫在千方百计地歌颂国民党的同时，却极力贬低伟大的中国共产党。他竟然歪曲历史事实，睁着眼睛瞎说：“我们不论怎样来准备反攻力量”，“我们在反攻日寇的总的力量中，总还是最小的一部分”，而“不是决定的力量”！?  
    国民党“拥有几百万武装”。这是事实。但是，正如毛主席所说：“名曰有三百万兵，实际上士气颓丧已极，有人比做一担鸡蛋，碰一下就要垮”。?中国赫鲁晓夫在国民党的几百万反革命武装前面，吓破了胆，因此，一遇机会就朝着它顶礼膜拜。
    国民党“在中国人民和世界上具有合法的地位”。这是彻头彻尾的国民党的奴仆的语言，这是对伟大的中国人民的侮辱。国民党统治下的中国人民，在死亡线上挣扎着，斗争着，早已看透了国民党反动派的凶残本质。什么国民党具有“合法”地位，这岂不是要中国人民永远在国民党统治下做牛马？！
    共产党“在反攻日寇的总的力量中，总还是最小的一部分”。这是对历史事实的恶意歪曲，是对抗日战争的中流砥柱——中国共产党领导的人民武装力量的无耻污蔑。毛主席指出，在一九三九年至一九四三年 “这几年内，国民党战场实际上没有严重的战争。日本侵略者的刀锋，主要地向着解放区。到一九四三年，侵华日军的百分之六十四和伪军的百分之九十五，为解放区军民所抗击；国民党战场所担负的，不过日军的百分之三十六和伪军的百分之五而已”。?中国赫鲁晓夫同一切修正主义分子一样，把革命力量说得一钱不值，把反革命力量吹得神乎其神。
    其三，中国赫鲁晓夫说：“现在（指一九四二年）大概蒋系不会投降了”，“大部投降的危险大概不会有了”，“蒋是要坚持抗战到底的”，“中国全民族一直坚持抗战以至于最后胜利，蒋是有功的”。?照中国赫鲁晓夫看来，中国人民真是应该给蒋介石立“纪念碑”送“民族英雄”的称号了！
    要知道，中国赫鲁晓夫这些话是在他给新四军的几位负责人一封信中说的。制造屠杀抗日军队的“皖南事变”的罪魁祸首蒋介石的血债还未清算，九千多名新四军指战员的血迹还没有干，中国赫鲁晓夫就迫不及待地向这个大刽子手献起媚来，替他梳妆打扮，高唱赞歌，这哪里还有一点共产党人的气味呢？
    什么蒋介石“不会投降了”，“是要坚持抗战到底的”，什么“蒋是有功的”！这种肉麻的语言只有从叛徒嘴里才喷得出来。请问：蒋介石有什么“功”？蒋介石消极抗日，同“日本的和平使者勾勾搭搭”，积极反共，“限共、溶共、反共之声遍于全国，惨案迭起，血花乱飞”，难道这不叫做投降，而叫做“抗战有功”吗？蒋介石实行法西斯的一党专政，以内战代抗战，以投降代独立，以分裂代团结，以黑暗代光明，难道蒋介石不是投降卖国的罪魁，反而是什么“坚持抗战到底”的“功臣”吗？真是无耻到了极点！
    中国赫鲁晓夫所大讲而特讲的战略和策略，完全是取消共产党领导的战略与策略，是国民党的战略与策略，是资产阶级反革命的战略与策略！
    中国民主革命的指导思想是共产主义，还是资产阶级民主主义？
    中国新民主主义革命的指导思想是什么？是共产主义，还是资产阶级民主主义？这是党内两条路线斗争的重要内容。在这个问题上，同在中国革命的领导权问题上一样，中国赫鲁晓夫完全暴露了他背叛革命、反对毛泽东思想的本质。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席明确坚定地指出：“中国的民主革命，没有共产主义去指导是决不能成功的，更不必说革命的后一阶段了。”?“共产主义是无产阶级的整个思想体系，同时又是一种新的社会制度。这种思想体系和社会制度，是区别于任何别的思想体系和任何别的社会制度的，是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的。封建主义的思想体系和社会制度，是进了历史博物馆的东西了。资本主义的思想体系和社会制度，已有一部分进了博物馆（在苏联）；其余部分，也已‘日薄西山，气息奄奄，人命危浅，朝不虑夕’，快进博物馆了。惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”?   
    中国赫鲁晓夫却偏偏跳出来同毛主席唱对台戏。他在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》中，硬把中国革命的指导思想说成“三民主义”。他危言耸听地说：“我以为中国革命能在国民党三民主义这面旗帜下进行，至少是民主革命这一段，要比用其他的旗子顺利得多。”?
    什么“其他的旗子”！就是共产主义旗帜。什么“三民主义旗帜”！就是资产阶级旗帜。中国赫鲁晓夫认为，资产阶级性质的民主革命，只能在资产阶级思想指导下进行。因此，他再三再四地鼓吹向美国、法国学习，说什么“我们必须在党内外及人民中进行关于民主的教育，应该指定同志去研究资产阶级革命时期的民主主义。”?一下子就可以看出，这是中国赫鲁晓夫对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的公开挑战！
    资产阶级民主主义能够作为中国民主革命的指导思想吗？曾经不止一次地作过，但是根本行不通，统统失败了。“帝国主义的侵略打破了中国人学西方的迷梦。”?“现在的世界，依靠共产主义做救星；现在的中国，也正是这样。”?“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”?中国人民只有找到了马克思列宁主义这个放之四海而皆准的普遍真理，掌握了科学共产主义的理论武器，才使中国革命的面目焕然一新，从旧民主主义革命发展到新民主主义革命，从失败走向胜利。在二十世纪四十年代，在毛主席的伟大著作《新民主主义论》发表之后，中国赫鲁晓夫还拚命地反对马克思列宁主义，声嘶力竭地叫嚷学习西方，宣扬资产阶级民主主义，这不清楚地说明他是一个道道地地的逆时代之潮流，违背人民群众之需要的资产阶级反动分子吗？
    中国赫鲁晓夫又说：“如果说是实行三民主义，人家都不怕，说是实现中共的最低纲领，人家都要有些害怕。其实这两者的内容基本上是相同的，那么我们为什么不说是实行三民主义，而硬要另搞一套呢？这一方面是幼稚，不懂得策略，也同样是不懂得战略。”?  
      “害怕”“实现中共的最低纲领”而“不怕”“实行三民主义”的“人家”是谁？是中国广大的工人农民吗？当然不是。害怕中国共产党最低纲领的只能是大地主、大资产阶级，他们从共产主义在中国一开始传播，就大骂共产主义是“洪水猛兽”，叫嚷“共产主义不适合中国国情”。中国的赫鲁晓夫究竟站在什么阶级立场上，替什么阶级说话，这难道还不清楚吗？
    所谓“我们为什么不说是实行三民主义，而硬要另搞一套”，这种反动透顶的谬论，并不是中国赫鲁晓夫的什么新发明，它不过是从蒋介石的反革命舆论制造厂中拣来的破烂。
    抗战以来，蒋介石国民党在加紧对共产党、八路军实行军事进攻的同时，在文化舆论界也向共产党、向马克思列宁主义发动了猖狂进攻。毛主席在《新民主主义论》中描写当时的情况说：蒋介石“计策已定，事不宜迟，于是雇上几个玄学鬼，再加几名托洛茨基，摇动笔杆枪，就乱唤乱叫、乱打乱刺了一顿。”当时，资产阶级顽固派胡说什么你们共产党既然把社会主义社会制度推到后一个阶段去了，你们既然又宣称“三民主义为中国今日之必需，本党愿为其彻底实现而奋斗”，那末，就把共产主义暂时收起好了。毛主席针对这一谬论指出：“这种议论，在所谓‘一个主义’的标题之下，已经变成了狂妄的叫嚣。”?一九三八年十二月，玄学鬼张君劢，在蒋介石的授意下，发表了臭名昭著的《致毛泽东先生的公开信》，说什么“窃以为目前阶段中，先生等既努力于对外民族战争，不如将马克思主义暂搁一边。”
    请看，张君劢叫喊共产党必须“将马克思主义暂搁一边”，中国赫鲁晓夫则叫喊共产党除了三民主义之外，不要“另搞一套”，这不是一个腔调、一路货色吗？在攻击马克思列宁主义的罪恶活动中，中国赫鲁晓夫，竟同张君劢之流成了“一家兄弟”！
    中国赫鲁晓夫污蔑坚持用共产主义、马克思列宁主义指导民主革命的同志是什么“幼稚”，是什么“不懂得策略”。那么，他这种不要“另搞一套”又是什么样的“策略”呢？就是不要共产主义、不要马克思列宁主义的“策略”，就是蒋介石、张君劢的“策略”。历史已经证明，谁要是推行这套反革命的策略，谁就成为历史的罪人，无产阶级的叛徒。
    武装斗争，还是“议会道路”？
    无产阶级夺取政权，是走暴力革命的道路，还是走“议会斗争”的道路，历来是马克思列宁主义同修正主义，无产阶级革命家同一切无产阶级的叛徒进行尖锐斗争的重要问题。
    暴力革命是无产阶级夺取政权的唯一正确的道路，是无产阶级革命的普遍规律。毛主席根据马克思列宁主义关于暴力革命的原理，总结了国际无产阶级革命和中国无产阶级领导的人民民主革命的经验，提出了“枪杆子里面出政权”的著名论断，创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的暴力革命学说。
    一九三八年，毛主席在党的六届六中全会上所作的结论中说：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”?
    一九三九年，毛主席在他写的《〈共产党人〉发刊词》一文中又告诫全党：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。十八年来，我们党的发展、巩固和布尔塞维克化，是在革命战争中进行的，没有武装斗争，就不会有今天的共产党。这个拿血换来的经验，全党同志都不要忘记。”?
    武装斗争是中国革命胜利的唯一道路。在革命领导权问题上和革命指导思想问题上彻底背叛了革命的中国赫鲁晓夫，在武装斗争问题上，更加疯狂地反对毛泽东思想。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》报告中说：“在我们队伍中，亦有少数同志有了几个枪杆子，就以为不得了，可以‘取得天下’”。?寥寥数语，完全暴露了他恶毒攻击毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”这一光辉思想的狰狞面目。
    掌握枪杆子，这是中国人民用血换来的经验。当时中国人民已经用枪杆子取得了革命的伟大胜利，并正在用枪杆子抗击着日本帝国主义的侵略和国民党的反动统治，打破了它们灭亡中国、消灭共产党的美梦。革命人民认为，只有用枪杆子才可以“取得天下”，这难道不是客观真理，而是罪过？
    中国赫鲁晓夫反对用枪杆子“取得天下”，那么他要用什么“取得天下”呢？他在二十世纪的四十年代，又从已经被列宁驳得体无完肤的第二国际老修正主义者那里捡来了“议会道路”，作为“取得天下”的“法宝”。
    抗日战争胜利后，蒋介石国民党在美帝国主义的支持下，一方面调兵遣将，积极准备内战。一方面又大唱和平高调，施放和平烟幕。我们伟大的统帅毛主席高瞻远瞩，洞察蒋介石国民党的阴谋，及时地告诫全党：“绝对不要希望国民党发善心，它是不会发善心的。”?“现在蒋介石已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”?但是，中国赫鲁晓夫丝毫不听毛主席的警告，就在内战爆发的前夜，一九四六年初，他提出了一整套所谓“和平民主新阶段”的谬论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫说：“可能不再经过内战达到民主革命成功。基本成功是通过宪法，成立议会。”“中国革命主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争。”“党的全部工作要实行转变，我们的一切组织要改变，转变到以非武装斗争为主，以适应新形势。”“一切政治问题要和平解决，以后党的发展，依靠我们党能作合法群众斗争运动。”“平津我们枪杆子未打进去，要议会斗争弄得好，可以用选票进去。”?  
    中国赫鲁晓夫把“议会道路”描绘得何等美妙！不是用枪杆子“取得天下”，不是枪杆子里面出一切；而是用选票就可以“取得天下”，有了选票就有了一切。这完全是帮助蒋介石国民党欺骗人民。
    用枪杆子“取得天下”，还是用选票“取得天下”，这是两条根本对立的道路。前者是马克思列宁主义的道路，革命的道路，胜利的道路，这是我们伟大领袖毛主席所主张和坚持的。后者是修正主义的道路，投降的道路，失败的道路，这是陈独秀、王明和中国赫鲁晓夫之流所主张和坚持的。
    列宁批判反对暴力革命主张议会道路的第二国际修正主义者时指出：“只有坏蛋或者傻瓜才会认为，无产阶级应当首先利用资产阶级压迫下和雇佣奴隶制压迫下进行的投票方式取得多数，然后才去夺取政权。这是绝顶的愚蠢或绝顶的虚伪，这是用旧制度旧政权下的投票来代替阶级斗争和革命。”?列宁说得何等好啊！历史表明：中国赫鲁晓夫不是一个绝顶愚蠢的“傻瓜”，而是一个绝顶虚伪的“坏蛋”！
    中国赫鲁晓夫不但是一个“议会迷”，而且是一个“官迷”。
    他得意忘形地说：“我党参加政府委员会，各院、部、省政府各级机关，我们成为政府党之一，不是在野而在朝了，有些人要去作官，中央政府的官。”还说：“我们参加政府，美国借的二十万美金就来了。”?  既有官作，又有钱花，照中国赫鲁晓夫看来，这真是一笔“赚钱的”买卖！他是多么希望这桩买卖赶快拍板成交，以便早日走马上任啊！
    什么共产党就要“成为政府党之一，不是在野而在朝了”！这是考茨基之流的语言。中国赫鲁晓夫热衷于“议会道路”的幻想，反对无产阶级武装夺取政权，他所谓的“政府党”，就是要把中国共产党变为议会党，变为国民党的附庸，变为掩饰大地主大资产阶级专政的屏风。
    什么“有些人要去作官，中央政府的官”！这是帝国主义分子赫尔利的语言。不是有个美国记者向我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“你们要听一听赫尔利的话，派几个人到国民党政府里去做官”吗？毛主席针锋相对地驳斥了他：“捆住手脚的官不好做，我们不做。要做，就得放开手放开脚，自由自在地做，这就是在民主的基础上成立联合政府。”?历史证明蒋介石国民党是绝对不会答应这个条件的，他们死抱着一党专政、法西斯独裁不放。中国赫鲁晓夫却要共产党人无条件地到国民党政府里去作官，这完全是适应国民党反动派的“限共”、“溶共”的需要，帮助美帝国主义、国民党反动派消灭共产党。
    什么“我们参加政府，美国借的二十万美金就来了”！为了“二十万美金”，中国赫鲁晓夫就可以出卖祖国，出卖人民，出卖革命，出卖自己的灵魂。真是廉价极了！
    共产党要在国民党政府下取得“合法”地位，到国民党政府里去作官，还有什么条件没有？有的！这就是蒋介石不断说的：“共产党交出军队，才有合法地位。”中国赫鲁晓夫唯蒋介石之命是听，连忙回答说：好，好！“我们的军队成为国军、国防军、保安队、自卫队，我军的支部、党委会、政治委员取消，在军队取消党的组织”。“各党停止对军队的直接领导、指挥，统一于国防部”。?中国赫鲁晓夫为了他能够到国民党政府里混个一官半职，要把当时中国共产党领导的一百二十万军队和二百万民兵武装，统统交给国民党。这种对中国人民利益的大拍卖，何其毒也！
    中国人民在二十多年的残酷斗争中建立起来的军队和武装，是革命人民的命根子。我们伟大的领袖毛主席代表中国广大人民庄严宣告：“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”?中国赫鲁晓夫的如意算盘破产了。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要把人民武装统统交给国民党的投降主义行动，并不是孤立的，这是一种国际投降主义思潮在中国党内的反映。在第二次世界大战中和第二次世界大战后，随着美、英、法同苏联在一些国际问题上的妥协，白劳德、多列士、陶里亚蒂等一伙无产阶级的叛徒，在国际共产主义运动中竭力散布投降主义思潮，推行投降主义路线。白劳德疯狂叫嚣取消美国共产党，多列士和陶里亚蒂为了换取几个议席、几名政府部长、副总理之类的官职，把共产党领导的武装统统交给了资产阶级政府。他们这种投降主义的谬论和行动影响到世界的许多地方，严重地破坏了各国人民的革命运动。我们伟大的领袖毛主席坚定地顶住了这股泛滥成灾的反动逆流，尖锐地批判了这种国际投降主义思潮。他在一九四六年四月所写的《关于目前国际形势的几点估计》中，指出：“美、英、法同苏联之间的这种妥协，只能是全世界一切民主力量向美、英、法反动力量作了坚决的和有效的斗争的结果。这种妥协，并不要求资本主义世界各国人民随之实行国内的妥协。各国人民仍将按照不同情况进行不同斗争。反动势力对于人民的民主势力的原则，是能够消灭者一定消灭之，暂时不能消灭者准备将来消灭之。针对这种情况，人民的民主势力对于反动势力，亦应采取同样的原则。”?这是当时世界上最正确、最光辉、最伟大的思想！这是永远闪耀着光芒的指导各国人民革命斗争的根本原则！
    法国共产党和意大利共产党的头头把武装交了出去，结果怎样呢？结果被资产阶级一脚踢开，落了一场空。武装交出去了，“合法”地位也取消了。无产阶级和其他劳动人民在反法西斯战争中取得的胜利果实，也完全被资产阶级攫取了。这两个共产党的领导，从此也变成了修正主义集团。可以肯定，如果中国赫鲁晓夫的荒谬主张实现了，中国就会比法国和意大利的共产党失败得更惨：千百万人头落地，什么议会，什么宪法，什么共产党在国民党政府中的“大官”，一个早晨统统被扫光。
    十分清楚：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的所谓“和平民主新阶段”，完全是在陈独秀、王明之后，把中国革命推向一个亡党亡头的“新阶段”！
    是反对国民党法西斯专政，还是反对抗日根据地的民主政权？
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”中国共产党在民主革命时期的战略和策略的集中点，就是推翻国民党的法西斯独裁，建立以无产阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的各革命阶级的联合专政。这是以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央关于中国新民主主义革命的基本纲领。中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命的战略和策略的集中点，就是维护国民党的大地主、大资产阶级专政，反对建立以无产阶级为领导的以工农联盟为基础的各革命阶级的联合专政。
    在中国民主革命的过程中，长时期存在着两种政权。一种是蒋介石国民党的法西斯专政，一种是共产党领导的根据地的各革命阶级联合专政。前者是革命的对象，后者是新中国的雏型和希望。怎样对待蒋介石国民党的反动政权和根据地的人民民主政权，这是检验真革命还是假革命、反革命的一个试金石。
    在抗日战争时期，为了彻底战胜日本帝国主义，为了建立一个人民共和国，我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导中国人民为发展、巩固抗日根据地的民主政权，反对国民党的大地主大资产阶级专政，进行了艰苦卓绝的斗争。毛主席针对国民党的法西斯独裁，针锋相对地提出了“废止一党专政，实行民主政治”的伟大战略方针。他指出：必须“将政治制度上国民党一党派一阶级的反动独裁政体，改变为各党派各阶级合作的民主政体”。不这样，“就不能动员人民进入抗战，取得保卫祖国和收复失地的胜利”。?毛主席还痛斥了蒋介石国民党发出的所谓“取消陕甘宁边区”的反革命叫嚣，他说：“陕甘宁边区是全国最进步的地方，这里是民主的抗日根据地。”“为什么要取消它呢？只有不要脸的人们才说得出不要脸的话，顽固派有什么资格站在我们面前哼一声呢？同志们，当然不能是这样的。不是取消边区，而是全国要学习边区”。?
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却完全背道而驰。在蒋介石国民党的“取消共产党”“取消八路军、新四军”，“取消陕甘宁边区”的反革命的紧锣密鼓声中，中国赫鲁晓夫赤膊上阵了！他不仅狂热地为蒋介石国民党的“一党专制”呼风唤雨，摇旗呐喊，而且公然面向着蒋家王朝，打起了“彻底改造根据地内的政权机构”的旗子。这是一面彻底背叛中国革命，彻底出卖无产阶级利益的反革命旗子。
    中国赫鲁晓夫究竟要怎样“彻底改造根据地内的政权机构”呢？请看他下面这段奇文：“根据地内政权的改造，不只是调换几个人，而且是政权机构各种制度的改造，而且是国体与政体的改造。”?又是“各种制度的改造”，又是“国体与政体的改造”，何等彻底，何等坚决！
    什么叫做“国体”、“政体”？毛主席在《新民主主义论》一书中指出：所谓国体问题，就是指“社会各阶级在国家中的地位”。“所谓‘政体’问题，那是指的政权构成的形式问题，指的一定的社会阶级取何种形式去组织那反对敌人保护自己的政权机关。”?“国体”和“政体”是国家各种制度中最根本的制度。中国赫鲁晓夫要“彻底改造”根据地政权的“国体”与“政体”，那是抓住了要害的。
    我们抗日根据地政权的“国体”和“政体”是怎样的呢？抗日根据地的政权是抗日民族统一战线的政权，是“三三制”的政权。一九四○年三月六日，毛主席在为中央写的对党内的一个指示中，指出：“根据抗日民族统一战线政权的原则，在人员分配上，应规定为共产党员占三分之一，非党的左派进步分子占三分之一，不左不右的中间派占三分之一。”毛主席还强调指出：“必须保证共产党员在政权中占领导地位”。?在这里，规定共产党员在人员分配上占三分之一，在政权中占领导地位，是最根本最重要的，它是抗日根据地民主政权的标志和灵魂。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“改造”根据地政权的“国体”与“政体”，就是反对和取消革命的“三三制”，就是反对和取消党的领导，就是要挖掉抗日民主政权的标志和灵魂。他恶狠狠地说：三三制“不是一种法律的规定。因此，在任何法律上，不应该有三三制的规定”。“我们没有权利要求在任何政府机关中，规定共产党员要占三分之一。”“同样，在法律上，也不能规定任何人在政府中的优势，及其领导地位”?。
    中国赫鲁晓夫呶呶不休地左一个“法律”，右一个“法律”，似乎他是天底下最高明的“法律家”了！你要在根据地内建立共产党员占三分之一的“三三制”政权吗？你要规定共产党在根据地政权中的领导地位吗？在中国赫鲁晓夫这个“法官”看来，那就是违背
  “法律”的，而且是违背“任何法律”的。什么“任何法律”！不是无产阶级的法律，就是地主资产阶级的法律；不是共产党的法律，就是国民党的法律。难道建立共产党领导的“三三制”政权会违背无产阶级的法律吗？很显然，中国赫鲁晓夫嘴里的“法律”，不是什么别的，而是大地主大资产阶级的法律，即国民党的法律。按照国民党的法律办事，共产党领导的“三三制”政权当然是不“合法”的，岂止不“合法”，简直应该打入十八层地狱！中国赫鲁晓夫为了反对和取消共产党领导下的“三三制”政权，居然抬出了国民党法律这张腐朽不堪的灵牌来，其反革命面目不是暴露得淋漓尽至了吗？
    既然共产党在抗日民主政权中的领导地位“不能规定”，那么共产党员干什么呢？中国赫鲁晓夫回答说：在“政权内部”干“合法斗争”。他说：“一切共产党员必须用心的来研究与学习合法斗争的策略，在三三制实行后，政权内部的斗争并未停止，只是改变了形式，共产党员在政府中的领导地位，只有经过合法斗争来保持与巩固”。
    真是妙极了！共产党在三三制政权的领导地位不能规定，只能“经过合法斗争”来争取，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的逻辑。这完全是取消共产党领导的叛徒逻辑。
    中国赫鲁晓夫要共产党人在自己领导的政府中学会合法斗争的奇谈怪论，彻底暴露了他要把我们抗日根据地的民主政权改造成为资产阶级议会制的罪恶目的。中国赫鲁晓夫不仅要共产党人到国民党政府里搞议会斗争，而且在自己领导的政府里也要搞议会斗争。荒唐到了何等地步！谁说中国赫鲁晓夫没有“发明”？这不就是他的“发明”？谁说中国赫鲁晓夫没有“创造”？这不是“创造”了“议会道路”的新的世界纪录？中国赫鲁晓夫比世界上任何一个议会迷更议会迷，他是一个双料的议会迷！在这位双料的议会迷面前，那些议会迷的老祖宗及其徒子徒孙，什么伯恩斯坦，什么考茨基，什么陶里亚蒂、多列士，统统望尘莫及，瞠乎其后了！
    中国赫鲁晓夫极力鼓吹所谓“彻底改造根据地内的政权机构”的谬论，完全是根据蒋介石国民党的“一党专政”的需要，妄图根本改变抗日民主政权的性质，以便统一于蒋介石，统一于国民党的大地主大资产阶级专制。请看他的自白：“抗日民主政权，只是地方政府。它应该是属于中央政府，受中央政府的领导并依照敌后情形执行中央政府的法令”。?中国赫鲁晓夫对国民党的中央政府如此恭顺，真是一个名副其实的“驯服工具”！他把国民党的中央政府当作“太上皇”，自己心甘情愿地当“儿皇帝”，这彻头彻尾地暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫是一个混进我们党内的大地主、大资产阶级的代理人。
    从当“儿皇帝”（所谓抗日民主政权属于国民党中央政府，受中央政府的领导）到当“二臣子”（所谓到国民党中央政府里去作官）这就是中国赫鲁晓夫在民主革命时期的基本思想，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫所谓“中国革命的战略与策略”的实质和核心。
    从取消共产党的领导，把民主革命的领导权拱手让给资产阶级国民党，到反对马克思列宁主义和共产主义，宣扬过了时的反动的资产阶级民主主义，到反对武装斗争，鼓吹“议会道路”，到维护国民党的一党专政，反对根据地的民主政权，这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的所谓“中国革命的战略与策略”。这是同我们伟大领袖毛主席所制定的新民主主义革命的总路线根本对立的。这是一套地地道道的资产阶级反革命战略与策略！这是一条不折不扣的反革命修正主义路线！
    中国赫鲁晓夫在《中国革命的战略与策略问题》的报告中，自称是什么“完整的马克思主义者”。严酷的历史表明：他根本不是什么“完整的马克思主义者”，而是完整的机会主义者、修正主义者！他集国内外一切机会主义、修正主义之大成，是当代世界上最大的反革命修正主义分子！
    “要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”现在，中国赫鲁晓夫已经完全陷入了革命大批判的汪洋大海之中，彻底覆灭，这就是他的命运，这就是历史的判决！注：①《中国的红色政权为什么能够存在？》《毛泽东选集》第一卷第五○页。②《中国共产党在抗日时期的任务》《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二五三页。③见《安源路矿工人俱乐部略史》，《救护汉冶萍公司》，《廖仲凯先生与工农政策》。④《中国共产党在抗日时期的任务》《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二五三页。⑤《上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第三八二、三八一页。⑥《上海太原失陷以后抗日战争的形势和任务》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第三八五页。⑦见《为发动华北广大群众的抗日救国运动而斗争》。⑧?????见《中国革命的战略与策略问题》。⑨见《六年敌后工作经验的报告》。⑩见《关于抗日游击战中的政策问题》。?见《目前抗战形势与如何坚持持久战争取最后胜利》。?《矛盾论》《毛泽东选集》第一卷第三○三页。???见《渡过艰苦的抗战阶段，准备反攻，创造战后建立新中国的条件》。?《评国民党十一中全会和三届二次国民参政会》《毛泽东选集》第三卷第九二○页。?《论联合政府》《毛泽东选集》第三卷第一○四三页。???《新民主主义论》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六七九页。??《论人民民主专政》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一四七五——一四七六页。?《新民主主义论》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六七八——六七九页。?《战争和战略问题》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第五三五页。?《〈共产党人〉发刊词》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六○○——六○一页。?《中共中央关于同国民党进行和平谈判的通知》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一五三页。?《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一二七页。???见《时局问题的报告》。?《向意大利、法国和德国的共产党人致敬》《列宁全集》第三○卷第四○页。?《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一三二页。?《关于重庆谈判》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一五九页。?《关于目前国际形势的几点估计》《毛泽东选集》第四卷第一一八一——一一八二页。?《中国共产党在抗日时期的任务》《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二四八页。?《团结一切抗日力量，反对反共顽固派》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第七一二页。???见《目前形势和华中三年工作基本总结及今后任务》。?《新民主主义论》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第六六九——六七○页。?《抗日根据地的政权问题》《毛泽东选集》第二卷第七三六页。?见《论抗日民族政权》。
