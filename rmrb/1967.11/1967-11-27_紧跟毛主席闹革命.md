	Our heart's most red, most red red sun, Chairman Mao, has repeatedly instructed us to take the socialist road, the road of collectivization. He says, "This is the inevitable path for the people to gain liberation and for the poor to become rich." In 1958, he issued the great call to "People's Communes are good." Under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants have firmly taken the happy road of socialist collectivization.

	Since the establishment of people's communes in our rural areas, their superiority has been fully demonstrated. However, China's Khrushchev hates them intensely and shouts about "retreat in agriculture, including contracting production to households and individual farming." This is extremely reactionary!

	We poor and lower-middle peasants, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, know clearly that "contracting production to households" will inevitably lead us poor and lower-middle peasants back to the old road, to our deaths; individual farming will inevitably lead us poor and lower-middle peasants to beg for food with a stick. In short, it will make us return to the miserable old society.

	In the old society, in our Dunsan Village, out of 236 households, 210 were long-term or short-term laborers for the landlords. My family of six rented four mu of land from a landlord, and my parents and I had to work as short-term laborers for the landlord. We toiled for the landlord all year round, but in the end, we still owed a lot of debts. One year, there was a severe drought, and the crops failed. On the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, it was snowing heavily. The landlord sent his henchmen to collect rent and reclaim the land. The henchmen pushed and pulled our dilapidated thatched hut, making a mess of everything, and threw our ragged belongings outside. Our whole family cried out in despair, calling to heaven but heaven did not answer, calling to earth but earth did not respond. We didn't even have a place to shelter from the wind and snow. After the henchmen left, my father, carrying a basket of pots, bowls, and chopsticks, led our family of old and young to flee. Because it was cold, the road was slippery, and we were hungry and shivering, we hadn't gone far when my father slipped and fell to the ground, breaking the pots, bowls, and chopsticks. Mother was carrying our two-month-old younger sister in her arms and holding our second younger sister by the hand, crying as she walked against the northwest wind. By dawn, the younger sister had frozen to death. A few days later, the second younger sister also starved to death. Later, with the help of class brothers, our family managed to settle down in another place, building a low, small reed hut and renting two mu of land from another landlord. Little did we know that all landlords are the same. Our family was again unable to pay the heavy rent, and my father was seized and beaten half to death.

	The bitterness of the old society is like the wind blowing through the hair, countless; it is like the water of the Yangtze River, endless. China's Khrushchev wants us to retreat to "individual farming," which means he wants us to suffer twice. We will never agree to this. The path of Chairman Mao, we poor and lower-middle peasants will definitely take! The golden bridge to communism that is the people's commune, we will definitely take! Whoever dares to block our way, we will trample them underfoot and crush them to pieces!

    紧跟毛主席闹革命
    江苏海安县学习毛主席著作积极分子  角斜公社墩里二队贫农社员  袁国银
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席一再教导我们要走社会主义道路，走集体化的道路，他老人家说：“这是人民群众得到解放的必由之路，由穷苦变富裕的必由之路”。一九五八年，他老人家又向我们发出“人民公社好”的伟大号召。我们贫下中农在伟大领袖毛主席的指引下，坚定地走上了社会主义集体化的幸福大道。
    我国农村人民公社一成立，就显示出她的无比优越性。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫对她却十分痛恨，拚命地叫嚷什么“农业上也要退够，包括包产到户，单干”，真是反动透顶！
    我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的贫下中农最清楚：“包产到户”必定是贫下中农回老路，上死处；单干，必定是贫下中农挟着竹棒去讨饭。总之，是让我们重新回到苦难的旧社会。
    在旧社会，我们墩里二百三十六户人家，就有二百一十户给地主做长工、打短工。我家六口人，租种地主四亩田，我和父母亲还要到地主家打短工。我们终年给地主家卖命，一年忙到头，结果还欠下一屁股的债。有一年，遭了大旱灾，庄稼颗粒无收。到了腊月二十九夜，天下着大雪，地主派来狗腿子逼租退田。狗腿子耀武扬威地把我家的破草棚推的推、拉的拉，搞得一塌糊涂，还把破破烂烂的东西尽往外掼。我们全家人抱头大哭，叫天天不应，喊地地不灵，连块避避风雪的地方也没有。狗腿子走后，父亲挑着一担锅、瓢、碗、盏，领着一家老小逃难。因为天冷，路滑，肚饿身颤，没走多远，父亲脚一滑，跌倒在地上，锅、瓢、碗、盏打得粉碎。妈妈怀里抱着两个月的小妹妹，手里搀着二妹妹，哭哭啼啼，顶着西北风向前走。天亮时，小妹妹冻死了。几天后，二妹妹也活活饿死了。后来，阶级兄弟帮忙，我家又在一个地方搭了个又矮又小的苇棚住下来，租了另外一个地主家二亩田。那晓得，天下乌鸦总是一般黑，那里的地主都一样恶毒。我家又因交不起重租，父亲被抓去打得死去活来。
    旧社会那个苦头，犹如风吹头发数不尽，好似长江的流水倒不完。中国赫鲁晓夫要我们退到“单干”，就是要我们吃二遍苦。我们决不答应。毛主席的路我们贫下中农走定了！人民公社这座通向共产主义的金桥我们走定了！谁敢在我们前头挡道，我们就把他踩在脚下，踩得他粉身碎骨！
