The proletarian educational revolution is an extremely profound revolution in the educational sphere to overthrow the bourgeoisie. Conducting this revolution means launching a great criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and their agents in the educational field, eliminating the poison of the bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" they shield, and fundamentally ending the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools, establishing a new type of proletarian educational system that suits the socialist system.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, over the decades, in his great revolutionary practice, has brilliantly and creatively enriched and developed the Marxist-Leninist theory on the proletarian educational revolution, proposing the most complete and scientific proletarian educational thought in human history. Chairman Mao's grand blueprint for communist education is being realized through the practice of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses.

This great revolution will not only thoroughly change the face of China's educational field but will also promote the struggle-criticism-reform in other fields, having an extremely profound impact on the entire society. Carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end and carrying the proletarian educational revolution through to the end is the glorious historical mission of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, relying on the activists among them, that is, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat who are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end."

To be the revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end is the latest battle call issued by Chairman Mao to us. This call expresses the wishes and determination of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat nationwide and has become a powerful driving force for the thought reform of the people nationwide and the growth and development of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, serving as a beacon for carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Under the inspiration of the excellent national situation, the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, exhibiting youthful vigor on the path of the proletarian educational revolution, and advancing with even more magnificent strides.

Chairman Mao has said: "We must cultivate a large number of people. These people are the vanguard of the revolution. These people have political foresight. These people are full of fighting spirit and spirit of sacrifice. These people are frank, loyal, active, and upright. These people do not seek personal gain but work solely for the liberation of the nation and society. These people are not afraid of difficulties and are always firm and brave in the face of difficulties. These people are not arrogant but are practical and down-to-earth."

The people Chairman Mao spoke of are the backbone of the Cultural Revolution. Relying on them and uniting and leading the broad revolutionary masses, the tasks of the Cultural Revolution and the proletarian educational revolution can be successfully completed.

Engels pointed out long ago: "The movement of the proletariat must necessarily pass through various stages of development; at each stage, a part of the people will stop and not advance further."

In our ranks, there are also a few people who were swept into the revolutionary torrent by the great wave of the mass movement, who were once passionate and fought bravely. However, their bourgeois worldview has not been thoroughly transformed, and under the heavy burden of "self," they lack the courage and determination to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. We must be highly vigilant and not become the "petty bourgeoisie who flip somersaults" that Lu Xun once described, who are passionate quickly, peaceful quickly, and even degenerate quickly.

The Cultural Revolution is advancing powerfully and magnificently. In the face of the new situation and new tasks, if someone does not firmly stand on the revolutionary stance of the proletariat and does not pay attention to their own thought reform, they may no longer meet the needs of the struggle tasks and may even be thrown off by the rapidly advancing vehicle. Only those who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and are determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end can lead the broad revolutionary masses and push the revolution forward.

To be the revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, the most fundamental thing is to always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always follow Chairman Mao, always follow Mao Zedong Thought, and always follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment. One must make a firm decision to follow to the end, learn to the end, and reform to the end. For every instruction from Chairman Mao, we must resolutely, swiftly, and unconditionally implement it in our thoughts and actions. We must carry out the struggle against selfishness and revisionism to the end, correctly treat ourselves, and while transforming the objective world, strive to transform our subjective world. We must learn from the great pioneer of cultural revolution, Lu Xun, to "constantly dissect others, but more ruthlessly dissect myself," thoroughly overcome bourgeois selfishness and all exploitative class thoughts, and achieve thought reform.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end must always pay attention to closely connecting with the masses, believing in the masses, and consulting with the masses on matters. They must always be the students of the masses. They must be good at uniting the vast majority to advance together. They must not only unite with those who have the same opinions but also unite with those who have different opinions. They must especially pay attention to uniting those who have opposed them and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes. They must always combine with the broad masses of workers and peasants, resolutely serve the workers and peasants for life, and gradually overcome their bourgeois worldview and establish a proletarian worldview in the long-term mass revolutionary struggle.

All revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end must actively and enthusiastically participate in the great practice of the proletarian educational revolution. They must dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, dare to innovate, and dare to create. They must dare to despise all the rotten things of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, both ancient and modern, domestic and foreign. Wherever the tentacles of the bourgeoisie reach, we must criticize and sweep there, making the entire old world's ideological system and educational institutions fall into ruins. On the foundation cleared of the debris of the exploiting classes, we will establish a brand-new proletarian educational system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, we must be good at using Mao Zedong Thought as a political microscope and telescope to observe the situation, using the sharp scalpel of dialectical and historical materialism to analyze various complex problems, not being deceived by temporary and local surface phenomena, always maintaining a clear mind about the situation, always full of the proletarian vigor, revolutionary optimism, and tireless fighting spirit.

Chairman Mao said, "The development of society has reached today's era, and the responsibility of correctly understanding the world and transforming the world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party. This process of transforming the world based on scientific understanding, in the world and in China, has reached a historical juncture—an unprecedentedly important juncture in history—this is to completely overturn the dark side of the world and China, transforming them into a bright world that has never been seen before."

Quickly heat the furnace red-hot, and only then can we succeed by striking while the iron is hot.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat determined to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end are, under the radiant sun of Mao Zedong Thought, creating with the broad revolutionary masses a bright world unprecedented in human history, advancing with proletarian heroism, hacking through thorns and thistles, and bravely forging ahead!

    做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派
    任立新
    无产阶级教育革命，是无产阶级在教育领域里推翻资产阶级的一次极其深刻的革命。进行这场革命，就是要对党内最大的一小撮走资派和他们在教育界的代理人展开大批判、大斗争，肃清他们所包庇的资产阶级反动学术“权威”的流毒，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，建立起适应社会主义制度的新型的无产阶级教育体制。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席，几十年来，在他革命斗争的伟大实践中，天才地、创造性地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级教育革命的理论，提出了人类历史上最完整、最科学的无产阶级教育思想。毛主席关于共产主义教育的宏伟蓝图，正在通过亿万革命群众的实践，变成活生生的现实。
    这个伟大的革命，不仅将彻底改变我国教育界的面貌，而且必将推动其它领域的斗批改，对整个社会发生极其深远的影响。把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的光荣历史任务。
    毛主席教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”
    做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，是毛主席向我们发出的最新的战斗号召。这个号召，表达了全国无产阶级革命派的愿望和决心，已经成为全国人民思想革命化和无产阶级革命派队伍发展壮大的强大动力，成为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的指路明灯。
    在全国大好形势的鼓舞下，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的广大无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在无产阶级教育革命的大路上，正奔放着青春的活力，以更加豪迈的步伐，向前迈进。
    毛主席说过：“要造就一大批人，这些人是革命的先锋队。这些人具有政治的远见。这些人充满着斗争精神与牺牲精神。这些人是胸怀坦白的，忠诚的，积极的，与正直的。这些人不谋私利，唯一的为着民族与社会的解放。这些人不怕困难，在困难面前总是坚定的，勇敢向前的。这些人不是狂妄分子，也不是风头主义者，而是脚踏实地富于实际精神的人们。”
    毛主席所讲的这些人，就是无产阶级文化大革命的中流砥柱。依靠他们，团结和带动广大革命群众，无产阶级文化大革命的任务，无产阶级教育革命的任务，才能够胜利地完成。
    恩格斯早就指出：“无产阶级的运动必然要经过各种发展阶段；在每一个阶段上都有一部分人停留下来，不再前进”。
    在我们的队伍中，也有少数人，他们被群众运动的大浪潮卷进革命的激流，也激烈过一阵，战斗过一阵。但是，他们的资产阶级世界观并没有得到彻底改造，在“私”字的重负下，没有勇气、没有决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。我们要十分警惕，不要做鲁迅曾经描写过的“激烈得快的，也平和得快，甚至于也颓废得快”的那种“翻着筋斗的小资产阶级”。
    无产阶级文化大革命，正在威武雄壮、声势浩大地向前发展。在新的形势新的任务面前，如果有人不坚定地站稳无产阶级革命立场，不重视自己的思想改造，就有可能不再适应斗争任务的需要，甚至会被飞速前进的车子摔下去。只有那些高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，才能够带动广大革命群众，把革命推向前进。
    做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，最根本的，就是要永远高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，永远紧跟毛主席，紧跟毛泽东思想，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署。要下定决心，活到老，跟到老，学到老，改到老。对毛主席的指示，每一条、每一项，都要坚决地、雷厉风行地、不折不扣地落实到我们的思想和实践中去。要把“斗私，批修”进行到底，正确对待自己，在改造客观世界的同时努力改造自己的主观世界。要向文化革命的伟大先驱鲁迅学习，“时时解剖别人，然而更多的是更无情面地解剖我自己”，彻底战胜资产阶级利己主义和一切剥削阶级思想，实现思想革命化。
    做决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，要时时注意密切联系群众，相信群众，遇事多同群众商量，永远做群众的小学生。要善于团结绝大多数人一道前进。不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要团结和自己意见不同的人，还要特别注意团结那些反对过自己，并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。要永远实行和广大工农群众结合在一起，下决心为工农服务一辈子，并在长期的群众革命斗争中，逐渐克服自己的资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。
    一切决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，都要积极地、热情地投入无产阶级教育革命的伟大实践中去。要敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢创造，要敢于蔑视古今中外一切封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的腐朽的东西。资产阶级的触角伸到那里，我们就批判到那里，扫荡到那里，把整个旧世界的思想体系和教育制度打个落花流水，在清扫了剥削阶级瓦砾的基地上，建立起闪烁着毛泽东思想光辉的崭新的无产阶级的教育体制。同时，我们还要善于用毛泽东思想这个政治上的显微镜和望远镜去观察形势，用辩证唯物主义和历史唯物主义这个犀利无比的解剖刀，去剖析各种错综复杂的问题，不被一时一地的表面现象所迷惑，永远对形势保持清醒的头脑，永远充满着无产阶级蓬勃的朝气、革命的乐观主义和永不疲惫的战斗力。
    毛主席说，“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。这种根据科学认识而定下来的改造世界的实践过程，在世界、在中国均已到达了一个历史的时节——自有历史以来未曾有过的重大时节，这就是整个儿地推翻世界和中国的黑暗面，把它们转变过来成为前所未有的光明世界。”
    快把那炉火烧得通红，趁热打铁才能成功。
    决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派，正在光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光照耀下，同广大革命群众一道创造人类历史上一个前所未有的光明世界，正在以无产阶级豪迈的英雄主义，披荆斩棘，奋勇前进！
