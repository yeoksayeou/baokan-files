Wang Shusheng Reports to Capital PLA Soldiers and Revolutionary Masses on His Visit

Wang Shusheng, the head of the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association delegation who recently visited heroic Albania, today reported to the Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers and revolutionary masses of the capital on his visit to Albania. He conveyed the Albanian people's warmest greetings to our great leader Chairman Mao and their unreserved support for the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution.

The venue was adorned with portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha. After the meeting began, everyone recited Chairman Mao's quotation: "The peoples of China and Albania, the parties and peoples of China and Albania, and the Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the whole world must unite to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries. A new world without imperialism, capitalism, and systems of exploitation will certainly be established." They also recited Comrade Enver Hoxha's quotation: "Our people, our party, and our government will advance together with the great people and the Communist Party of China on the common revolutionary road, standing shoulder to shoulder with them in times of peace and storm, and advancing together in the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism for the victory of revolution and socialism."

Wang Shusheng said in his report that during the delegation's visit to Albania, they were always immersed in a sea of revolutionary friendship. Wherever they went, they heard shouts of "Long live Comrade Mao Zedong!" "Mao Zedong—Enver" "Enver—Mao Zedong." At the celebrations of our national day held in various places in Albania, Albanian comrades enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao for his creative development of Marxism-Leninism and highly evaluated the great victory of the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution. The Albanian people hold unlimited admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao, and they sincerely exclaimed from the bottom of their hearts: "Chairman Mao, we love you!" Albanian comrades are very eager to obtain the Albanian-language edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." They regard the Albanian-language edition of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" published in China as the most precious gift from the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people to the Albanian Labor Party and the Albanian people. They said, "We will keep Mao Zedong Thought firmly in our hearts. We will study and master Mao Zedong Thought well."

Wang Shusheng said that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the Albanian people have held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, persisted in the proletarian revolution, and persisted in the dictatorship of the proletariat. They have achieved brilliant victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, and in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. The Albanian people are advancing courageously along the road of revolutionization, and the spiritual outlook of the masses has undergone tremendous changes. The revolutionization movement has powerfully promoted the rapid development of socialist construction. The Albanian people persist in holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, fully carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and have built Albania into an advanced socialist country with modern industry and collective agriculture.

Wang Shusheng said that the delegation learned a lot of precious experience in Albania. We were deeply moved by the revolutionary heroic spirit of the fraternal Albanian people who are fearless of violence, threats, risks, and sacrifices, and who are tenaciously fighting. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, the heroic Albanian people will always advance from victory to victory.

During Wang Shusheng's report, the entire audience repeatedly shouted: "Salute to the heroic Albanian people!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Today's report meeting was organized by the China Association for International Friendship and the Sino-Albanian Friendship Association. Chu Tu-nan, president of the China Association for International Friendship, presided over the meeting. Leaders from relevant departments, including Wang Xinting and Qiao Guanhua, attended the meeting.

Attending the meeting at the invitation were Baba Ni, chargé d'affaires of the Albanian Embassy in China, and other Albanian comrades.

After the report meeting, a large-scale documentary film "Long Live the Great Sino-Albanian Friendship" about the Albanian National Song and Dance Ensemble's visit to China was shown.

    王树声说，阿尔巴尼亚人民在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导下，高举马克思列宁主义革命大旗，坚持无产阶级革命，坚持无产阶级专政，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，在反对帝、修、反的斗争中，取得了辉煌胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民正沿着革命化的大道奋勇前进，人民群众的精神面貌发生了巨大的变化；革命化运动有力地推动了社会主义建设事业的迅速发展。阿尔巴尼亚人民坚持一手拿镐，一手拿枪，高度发扬了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，已把阿尔巴尼亚建设成一个具有现代工业和集体化农业的先进的社会主义国家。
    王树声说，代表团在阿尔巴尼亚学到了很多宝贵的经验，我们也深深地被兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民的不畏强暴、不怕威胁、不怕风险、不怕牺牲、英勇顽强的革命英雄气概所感动。我们坚信，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，将永远从胜利走向胜利。
