Cadres from the Beijing Knitting Factory's intermediate and senior levels who attended the Mao Zedong Thought study class have undergone self-criticism and ideological remolding. During the study period, they spent two days going deep into the workshops, working alongside the workers, and having heart-to-heart talks while soliciting opinions from the masses, sincerely accepting their criticisms.

    Where You Fall, Get Up There

    When the former secretary of the Party Branch of the First Factory, Feng Yuxiu, went down to the workshop, he had many concerns. He thought: I executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution and made mistakes. The masses will definitely not forgive me, and I might even get a cold shoulder.

    After mustering the courage to go down, he was completely surprised to find that the masses not only did not dislike him but even welcomed him with applause. He deeply felt the warmth of class friendship, and all his concerns vanished. When the masses criticized him, they were very frank and sincere, and they also expressed their hopes and demands. An old worker from the parts warehouse said to him: "Old Feng, when we criticized you before, it was to liberate you from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line, to remove your official airs, and to hope that you would become a good cadre who serves the people wholeheartedly. Think about it, before 1953, we worked, studied, and lived together, understanding each other deeply and being very close. But after you became the secretary, you changed, became arrogant, and looked down on us workers. You haven't been to our warehouse for a long time. Today you came, and we want you to recognize your mistakes, correct them, and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, following Chairman Mao's revolution to the end!" Before leaving, the old worker also gave him a copy of the "Three Articles." On the way back, he kept thinking about the old worker's sincere and frank words, feeling that every sentence hit the mark. He felt ashamed of himself for letting down Chairman Mao, the Party, and the revolutionary masses. What should he do in the future? There's no question about it, get up where you fall, follow Chairman Mao, and resolutely revolutionize to the end!

    Correcting Mistakes Makes You a Good Comrade

    When the former deputy director of the Security Department, Zhu Delin, went to the workshop, many workers gave him copies of Chairman Mao's quotations and asked if he had memorized the "Three Articles." The workers studied Chairman Mao's works with him, engaged in self-criticism together, and jointly denounced and criticized the crimes and harm of the bourgeois reactionary line. The workers also helped him analyze the causes of his mistakes and summarize the lessons learned. Many workers said: "When you were workers, you were plain and enthusiastic, and we were very close. Why did the masses have so many complaints about you after you became a cadre? It's because you didn't follow Chairman Mao's teachings, lacked a mass perspective, and didn't follow the mass line. In recent years, you've become an important official, thinking you're great, not listening to the masses' opinions, not accepting their criticisms, not consulting the masses on matters, treating people unequally, from not believing in the masses to gradually developing into alienating the masses, and even suppressing the masses... You treated the masses like this, how could the masses not be angry?"

    Zhu Delin humbly accepted the masses' criticisms and sincerely made self-criticisms. The workers said: "We only ask you to 'change.' If you make a mistake, change it. Correcting mistakes makes you a good comrade!"

    The revolutionary masses' reasonable criticisms deeply moved Zhu Delin. He deeply realized that the reason for his repeated mistakes over the years was mainly because he had seriously alienated himself from the masses.

    Only by Going to the Masses Can You Truly Stand Up

    In the past two days, Deputy Director Zhang Chengming went to the masses and received profound education. He felt that only by going to the masses could he truly stand up.

    Before going down to the workshop, Zhang Chengming had some "knots" in his mind, not wanting to be a cadre anymore, and even telling his children not to become cadres when they grow up. After going to the workshop, the enthusiastic help from the worker comrades untied his "knots," making him understand that the masses' past criticisms of him were entirely out of hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line and love for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which was a rescue for him. Zhang Chengming deeply felt that a cadre cannot be away from the masses for a moment and resolved to always unite and fight with the masses in the future, always maintain a plain and hardworking style, and always be a student of the masses.

专栏：革命群众来信

    一刻也不能脱离群众
    北京针织总厂中上层干部毛泽东思想学习班的学员们，经过斗私批修，精神面貌焕然一新。在学习期中，他们抽出两天时间，深入车间，和工人一起，边劳动边谈心，广泛征求群众意见，诚恳地接受群众的批评。
      在哪里跌倒，就在哪里爬起来
    原一分厂总支书记冯玉秀下车间时，顾虑重重，心想：自己在文化大革命中执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，群众一定不会谅解，说不定还会碰钉子。
    硬着头皮下去后，完全出乎意料，群众不但不讨厌他，反倒鼓掌欢迎。他深深感到阶级友爱的温暖，各种顾虑一下子全没了。群众在向他提出批评意见时，都是十分坦率和诚恳，并且向他提出了希望和要求。零件库有一位老工人对他说：“老冯，我们过去批判你，是为了把你从资产阶级反动路线的枷锁中解放出来，是为了斗掉你的官架子，希望你成为全心全意为人民服务的好干部。你想想，一九五三年以前，咱们工作在一起，学习在一起，生活在一起，彼此之间互相了解，亲密无间；可是你当了书记后变了，架子大了，看不起我们工人了，长期没见你到过我们库里来。今天你来了，我们要你认识错误，改正错误，回到毛主席的革命路线上来，紧跟毛主席革命到底！”临走时，这位老工人还送给他一本“老三篇”。一路上，他老想着这位工人中肯、坦率的话，觉得句句话都打中了自己的要害，恨不得把满身的“污垢”一下子清除掉。他感到对不起毛主席，对不起党，对不起革命群众。今后怎么办？没说的，从哪里跌倒，就从哪里爬起来，紧跟毛主席，坚决革命到底！
        改正了错误，就是好同志
    原保卫科副科长朱德林到车间后，许多工人向他赠送了毛主席语录，询问他背过“老三篇”没有。工人们和他一起学习毛主席著作，一起斗私批修，一起控诉和批判资产阶级反动路线的罪恶和毒害。工人们还帮助他分析犯错误的原因，总结犯错误的教训。许多工人说：“你们当工人时，朴素热情，彼此亲密无间，为什么当了干部后群众对你们意见大了呢？就是因为你们不听毛主席的教导，缺乏群众观点，不走群众路线。这些年，你们官做大了，自以为了不起，群众的意见听不进，群众的批评不接受，遇事不和群众商量，不平等待人，由不相信群众，慢慢发展到脱离群众，甚至发展到压制群众……。你们对群众这个样，群众还能没有气？”
    朱德林虚心接受了群众的批评，诚恳地作了自我批评。工人们又说：“我们要求你们的只有一个‘改’字，错了就改，改正错误，就是好同志！”
    革命群众通情达理的批评，使朱德林很感动。他深刻地认识到，这几年之所以错误不断，主要就是因为自己严重脱离群众。
              到群众中去，才算真正站出来
    副厂长张成明这两天到群众中去后，受到深刻的教育。他感到只有到群众中去，才算真正站出来。
    张成明没有下车间前，思想上还有“疙瘩”，不愿再当干部了，甚至叫孩子长大后也别当干部。到车间后，工人同志们热情的帮助，使他解开了“疙瘩”，懂得了群众过去对自己的批评，完全是出于对资产阶级反动路线的痛恨，对毛主席革命路线的热爱，也就是对自己的挽救。张成明深深感到当干部一刻也不能脱离群众，决心今后永远和群众团结在一起，战斗在一起，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风，永远做群众的小学生。
