In the spring of 1957, we responded to Chairman Mao's call to "all those intellectuals who can go to the countryside to work should be happy to go there. The countryside is a vast expanse, and there is great potential for achievement there." Some classmates from the graduating class of Xuchang No. 2 Middle School, who came from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds, decided to return to the countryside to become the first generation of new farmers with socialist consciousness and education. At this time, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party came to Xuchang. He blatantly opposed Chairman Mao, advocating the path of "promotion and wealth" and "fame and fortune." He told us that after returning to the countryside, we should honestly farm for three to five years. "If you master three skills (being proficient in farming, having education, and having good relations with the people), the masses will elect you as a township cadre, county cadre, provincial cadre, and you might even go to the central government, depending on your abilities." He shamelessly boasted, "The first generation gets the advantage. I joined the revolution as the first generation and now I am a member of the Central Committee. The second and third generations won't be able to do this." The capitalist "business tactics" advocated by China's Khrushchev are completely a black version of the "Study of Modesty." The difference is that this time it is more specific and more blatant, and the harm is greater.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their position, are servants of the people," and they should "completely and thoroughly serve the people." The "promotion and wealth" path advocated by China's Khrushchev is to lure young people onto the path of selfish individualism, seeking fame, profit, power, and position. He says you shouldn't become a cadre when you go back, but in reality, he uses the prospect of becoming a bigger cadre in the future as bait, wanting young people to follow his methods to "cultivate" and "train," attempting to cultivate a generation of young people into bourgeois personal ambitionists. His intentions are extremely malicious.

Even more blatant is that the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party openly said at a meeting that whether one can become a cadre at a certain level "depends on one's abilities." This completely exposes his political speculator's face. From his speech, it is not difficult to see that his so-called abilities are the abilities of "promotion and wealth," the abilities of bourgeois politicians to manipulate power. Look, his intentions are so malicious, and the corruption of young people is so serious! In the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, there is a strong smell of bourgeois "copper rust," where can one find a trace of revolutionary spirit? He is not a "senior revolutionary" at all, but a thorough fake revolutionary, counter-revolutionary.

"With the golden monkey raising the thousand-pound rod, the jade sky is cleansed of a myriad of dust." We revolutionary factions of the proletariat must hold high the banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought, take "criticize selfishness, criticize revisionism" as the guideline, thoroughly criticize the "promotion and wealth" path of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, and completely eliminate its poison in the minds of the youth!

    批臭腐朽的“升官发财”之道
    河南许昌县长村张公社屯北大队社员  刘土生
    一九五七年春天，我们响应毛主席发出“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的”的号召，许昌市二中毕业班的一些贫下中农出身的同学，决心回乡当第一代有社会主义觉悟的有文化的新农民。就在这时，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派来到许昌，他明目张胆地和毛主席唱对台戏，大肆鼓吹“升官发财”、“成名成家”之道。他要我们回乡后老老实实种三五年地，“具备了三条（种地样样都会，有文化，群众关系好）群众就会选你当乡干部、县干部、省干部，也可能到中央，那就看各人的本事了”。他还恬不知耻地自我炫耀说：“第一代是要得便宜的，参加革命我是第一代，现在成为中央委员，第二、三代象这样就不成了”等等。中国赫鲁晓夫所鼓吹的这一套资本主义“生意经”，完全是黑《修养》的翻版。所不同的，就是这次讲得更具体，更露骨，危害性更大。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，要“毫不利己专门利人”，要“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。而中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“升官发财”之道，就是要诱骗青年向争名、争利、争权、争位的利己主义的邪路上走。他嘴上说你们回去不要当干部，实际上是以将来当更大的干部为诱饵，要青年按照他的那套办法去“修养”、去“锻炼”，企图把青年一代培养成为资产阶级的个人野心家，其用心是非常恶毒的。
    更为露骨的是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派竟公然在会上胡说什么能不能当上那一级干部，“那就看各人的本事了”。这完全暴露了他的政治投机商面目。从他的讲话中不难看出，他的所谓本领，就是“升官发财”的本领，是资产阶级政客耍弄权术的本领。请看，他的用心多么恶毒，对青年的腐蚀有多么严重！在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派身上，到处散发出资产阶级的“铜臭”味，那儿还嗅得到一点革命者的气息呢？他根本不是什么“老革命”，而是地地道道的假革命、反革命。
      “金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃。”我们无产阶级革命派一定要高举毛泽东思想的批判旗帜，要以“斗私，批修”为纲，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“升官发财”之道批深、批透，彻底肃清其在青年中的流毒！
