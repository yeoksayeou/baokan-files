The editorial note: The Soviet revisionist clique sings various tunes about the "whole people's state," the "friendly classes'" "whole people's political organizations," and "socialist democracy for all." These are all lies. What they practice in the Soviet Union is a thorough and complete bourgeois dictatorship.

Look at the Soviet Union today:

It is not the proletariat that controls the state apparatus and exercises bourgeois dictatorship; rather, a small clique of revisionist leaders who have usurped power uses the repressive apparatus under their control to suppress revolutionary masses!

It is not the laboring people who are masters of the country; rather, the bourgeois privileged class rides roughshod over the people!

It is not the broad masses who enjoy democracy and freedom; rather, traitors and renegades, relying on their power, run rampant!

It is not the workers and peasants who enjoy the fruits of their labor; rather, the new capitalists and rich peasants ruthlessly exploit the blood and sweat of the laborers!

It is not the traitors and counter-revolutionaries who are punished; rather, patriots and revolutionary people are imprisoned and slaughtered!

What "whole people's state"! The Soviet revisionist clique puts up this sign entirely to cover up the brutal bourgeois dictatorship they practice.

The Soviet revisionist clique continually strengthens the apparatus of bourgeois dictatorship and intensifies the suppression of the Soviet laboring people. This is inevitable. These traitors are fundamentally opposed to the more than 90% of the Soviet population. The contradiction between the small bourgeois privileged class in the Soviet Union and the broad Soviet people is an antagonistic contradiction, an enemy contradiction. The Soviet revisionist clique cannot maintain their reactionary rule without using counter-revolutionary violence against the Soviet people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of the wheel of history, revolution will inevitably occur and will certainly be victorious, whether sooner or later." The more the Soviet revisionist clique oppresses the Soviet people, the more intense the Soviet people's resistance will become. The Soviet revisionist clique's counter-revolutionary regime will inevitably be swept away by the revolutionary tide of the Soviet people.

What is the true nature of the Soviet revisionists' "socialist democracy for all"?

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, under the banner of the "whole people's state," uses sweet-talking words to boast about "socialist democracy." But in today's Soviet Union, do the laboring people have democracy? What is the true nature of the so-called "socialist democracy for all"?

Today, in the Soviet Union, there is only democracy for the bourgeois privileged class, and there is absolutely no democracy for the laboring people. The new and old bourgeois elements who control the power of the Soviet party and government control the entire set of repressive tools, including the military, police, and courts. To consolidate and strengthen the rule of the bourgeois privileged class, they practice bourgeois dictatorship over the laboring people and suppress the people's resistance.

"Madhouse"

Today, in Lenin's hometown, anyone who insists on the proletarian standpoint, adheres to Marxism-Leninism, and dares to speak out will suffer persecution and suppression. Anyone who expresses different views on the policies of the Soviet revisionist clique will be arrested, interrogated, imprisoned, or sent to a so-called "madhouse" as a "mental patient." For example, a female party member was arbitrarily expelled from the party and forcibly sent to a "madhouse" for disagreeing with the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the revolution and was declared a "madwoman." Some Soviet people were sent to a "madhouse" just for expressing friendship towards the Chinese people during a visit to China. Some were forcibly sent to a "madhouse" for inspection just for opposing the Soviet revisionist clique's agricultural policies. After the "inspection," of course, they became "madmen." The way the Soviet revisionists persecute revolutionary people is so vicious!

"Concentration Camps"

There are many concentration camps in the Soviet Union, where many people are imprisoned and exiled. A teacher was sent to a concentration camp to do hard labor just for being dissatisfied with the situation in the Soviet Union. According to someone who escaped from a secret concentration camp in Belarus, the camp is filled with people of various nationalities, and the living conditions are extremely harsh.

"Secret Police Surveillance"

Moreover, the Soviet revisionist ruling clique uses various spy tactics to impose fascist terror on the broad laboring people.

In schools, some fake "students" are professional spies who gather information and specifically persecute progressive teachers and students. In hotels, some spies pretend to "read newspapers" to monitor passersby. According to a middle school teacher's revelation, there are spies everywhere in Soviet society today, secretly eavesdropping, following, and surveilling. At the slightest pretext, they persecute people under the charge of "conducting anti-Soviet activities." A firefighter said that in recent years, in the area where he works, the number of secret police and spies has increased by two or three times. Some spies carry recording machines and record the people's speeches as "evidence" for framing them.

"Such Democracy"

Under this fascist rule, the Soviet society is shrouded in a white terror, and the people do not even have the right to speak. Where is there any trace of the "socialist democracy" that the Soviet revisionists boast about?! In the toilet of the "Officers' House" in Minsk, there is a satirical poem that vividly depicts the "democracy" and "freedom" of the Soviet people. The poem reads:

	Writing in a filthy toilet,
	This habit is not new.
	Friend, do you agree:
	Freedom of speech is only here!

### 苏修“全民的社会主义民主”是什么货色？

专栏：

    编者按：苏修集团用各种调子高唱什么“全民国家”，什么“友好阶级”的“全民政治组织”，什么“全民的社会主义民主”。这统统是骗人的鬼话。他们在苏联所实行的，是彻头彻尾的资产阶级专政。
    请看今日的苏联：
    不是无产阶级掌握国家机器，专资产阶级的政，而是一小撮已经篡夺领导权的修正主义头目利用他们控制的专政机器，镇压革命群众！
    不是劳动人民当家作主，而是资产阶级特权阶层骑在人民头上作威作福！
    不是广大人民享有民主、自由，而是工贼、叛徒依仗权势，横行霸道！
    不是工人、农民享有自己的劳动成果，而是新资本家、新富农残酷榨取劳动者的血汗！不是卖国贼、反革命受到制裁，而是爱国者、革命人民横遭监禁和屠杀！
    什么“全民国家”，苏修集团打出这块招牌，完全是为了掩盖他们所实行的残酷的资产阶级专政。
    苏修集团不断强化资产阶级专政的机器，加紧镇压苏联劳动人民，这是必然的。这些叛徒同占苏联人口百分之九十以上的苏联人民，是根本对立的。苏联一小撮资产阶级特权阶层同广大苏联人民之间的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。苏修集团不对苏联人民使用反革命的暴力手段，就无法维持他们的反动统治。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”苏修集团对苏联人民的压迫愈甚，苏联人民对他们的反抗也必将愈加激烈。苏修集团的反革命小朝廷终究要被苏联人民的革命怒潮席卷而去。
    苏修“全民的社会主义民主”是什么货色？
    苏修统治集团打着“全民国家”的幌子，用娓娓动听的词句大肆吹嘘什么“社会主义民主”。可是，在今天的苏联，劳动人民到底有没有民主？所谓“全民的社会主义民主”到底是什么货色？
    现在的苏联，只有资产阶级特权阶层的民主，根本没有劳动人民的民主。掌握着苏联党、政大权的新旧资产阶级分子控制着军队、警察、法院等全套专政工具。他们为了巩固和加强资产阶级特权阶层的统治，对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政，镇压人民的反抗。
                      “疯人院”
    今天，在列宁的故乡，谁要是坚持无产阶级立场，坚持马克思列宁主义，敢说敢讲，谁就会遭到迫害和镇压。谁如果对苏修集团的政策提出不同看法，就会被逮捕传讯、被关进监狱或被当作“精神病患者”送进所谓“疯人院”。例如，一位女党员因为不同意苏修背叛革命的观点，便被蛮横地开除党籍，强迫送往“疯人院”，被宣布为“疯子”。有的苏联人因访华时表示了对中国人民的友好，回国后就被投入“疯人院”。
    有的因对苏修统治集团的农业政策表示反对，也被强行送入“疯人院”检查，经过“检查”，当然也就成了“疯子”。苏修迫害革命人民的这种方式，既不要口供，也不需任何法律形式，真是毒辣透顶！
                         集中营
    在苏联设有不少集中营，监禁和流放了很多人。一个教员因为对苏联的现状不满，就被关进集中营当苦工。据从白俄罗斯一个秘密集中营里逃出来的人说，集中营里有各民族的人，生活条件极端恶劣。
                        特务盯梢
    不仅如此，苏修统治集团还用各种各样的特务手段，对广大劳动人民实行法西斯恐怖统治。
    在学校里，有的冒牌“学生”是专业特务，他们刺探情况，专门干迫害进步师生的勾当。在旅馆里，有的特务装做“看报”，监视来往过客。据一个中学教员揭露说，现在苏联社会上到处是特务，暗中偷听，跟踪盯梢，动不动就以“进行反苏活动”的罪名进行迫害。一个消防队员说，近几年在他工作的地区，秘密警察、特务又增加了两三倍，有的特务身带录音机，随时录下群众的言论作为陷害的“证据”。
                        如此民主
    在这种法西斯统治下，苏联社会笼罩着一片白色恐怖，人民连说话的权利都没有，哪里还有半点苏修所标榜的“社会主义民主”！？在明斯克“军官之家”剧场厕所里有一首打油诗，辛辣地描绘了苏联人民的“民主”和“自由”。诗中写道：
    肮脏的厕所里写东西，
    这种风习不新奇。
    朋友，你可同意：
    言论自由只有在这里！
