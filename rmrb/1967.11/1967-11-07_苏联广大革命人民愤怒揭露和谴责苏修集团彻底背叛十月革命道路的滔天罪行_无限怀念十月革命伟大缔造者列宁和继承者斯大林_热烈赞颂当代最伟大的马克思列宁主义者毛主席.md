The broad masses of the Soviet people are angrily exposing and condemning the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin, who have completely betrayed the path of the October Revolution. They have fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, once again shackling the Soviet working people with the chains of the old world. The revolutionary people of the Soviet Union are angrily exposing and condemning the various heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist traitors. They deeply cherish the great founders of the October Revolution, Lenin, and his successor, Stalin, and enthusiastically praise the contemporary greatest Marxist-Leninist, Chairman Mao.

Listen to the voices of the Soviet people!

Indicting the Soviet Revisionist Clique for Betraying the Dictatorship of the Proletariat and Implementing the Dictatorship of the Bourgeoisie

The Soviet people indignantly denounce the Soviet revisionist leadership for betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat and implementing the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, ruthlessly oppressing and exploiting the working people. An old worker lamented, "The dictatorship of the proletariat, the power of the laboring classes, no longer exists in the Soviet Union." Another worker comrade said, "The state power now formally belongs to the Soviet people, but in reality, it is in the hands of the people's enemies." Soviet workers call the Soviet revisionist clique "agents of the bourgeoisie" and "bourgeois philistines." A combine harvester driver from Irkutsk said, the Soviet revisionist clique "is going in the opposite direction from the people; the people move forward, they drag them backward; the people want revolution, they do not allow revolution."

Despite the Soviet revisionist leadership's endless boasting about "Soviet democracy," the Soviet working people do not enjoy any democratic rights. They have no say in politics, and their work and life lack basic guarantees, facing the possibility of being fired at any time. A worker who went from Karaganda to Moscow for a visit said, in Karaganda, "Workers often go on strike to oppose layoffs." Many people said, "We ordinary workers have no freedom." An old woman said, "If you criticize the factory director, you will immediately face retaliation." A young man said, "Here, the people are no longer the masters of the state; everything is decided by the officials... Today, people seem to be living in the tsarist era."

The Soviet people, based on their personal experiences, have exposed the lie spread by the Soviet revisionist clique that they are "heirs to Lenin's cause." As an Irkutsk worker said, "The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique has betrayed Marxism-Leninism and betrayed Lenin's path, dragging the Soviet Union onto the capitalist road." Some said, today's Soviet Union, "Khrushchevism has replaced the revolutionary proletarian policy," "revisionism masquerades as Leninism." Therefore, throughout the Soviet Union, one can hear angry curses against the contemporary biggest revisionist, Khrushchev, and his successors, Brezhnev and Kosygin. People think that these people are all of a kind, "essentially just as bad."

Exposing the Soviet Revisionist Clique's Use of "Building Communism" to Restore Capitalism

The Soviet revisionist leadership took the opportunity of "celebrating" the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution to shamelessly boast about their fake communist construction and true capitalist restoration. But this cannot deceive the broad masses of Soviet working people. In Moscow and Karaganda, in Central Asia and the Baltic coast, workers generally expose that the Soviet revisionists have betrayed socialism and changed the originally fully state-owned socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises owned by a small privileged class. A worker from the Uzbek Republic pointed out bluntly that currently, Soviet factories are "no longer socialist, but capitalist" enterprises. Many workers pointed out that after the Soviet revisionist leadership implemented the "new system" with capitalist profit principles as the core, Soviet factory enterprises took pursuing profits as the highest goal and treated workers as hired slaves. They revealed that in order to pursue high profits, enterprise leaders would do anything: to make more money, they would cheat and cut corners in production; they would not care about workers' health and working conditions. According to the exposure by textile workers, their working environment is poor, the equipment is bad, and the labor intensity is high, making them exhausted after work. According to the Soviet revisionist _Steam Whistle News_, some female workers indignantly accused that enterprise leaders deliberately made them "do the heaviest work."

When promoting the "new system," the Soviet revisionist clique emphasized material incentives, using bonuses to tempt workers. In fact, most of the bonuses in various places were taken by those bourgeois officials, while workers were subjected to even more ruthless exploitation. An old miner from Ukraine talked about how several mines in their area had not completed their plans for years. But strangely, the mine directors could still receive large bonuses for saving materials, labor, and so on. He angrily said, "They are not of the same class as us workers; they do not care about our hardships at all." A young technician from Moscow pointed out, "Implementing the 'new system' makes the rich richer and the poor poorer; now there is no truth here."

Condemning the Soviet Revisionist Clique's Full Implementation of Revisionist Policies, Leading to Worsening Class Division

Due to the full implementation of revisionist policies by the Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, class division in Soviet society is becoming increasingly severe, and the gap between the rich and the poor is widening. The bourgeois high-income class and privileged figures live a life of debauchery, while the working people are in a state of hardship. A combine harvester driver from Irkutsk told a Chinese comrade, "Our workers now have very little income and a hard life." In Moscow, Ukraine, Siberia, and other places, one can hear ordinary laborers saying everywhere, "With such little wages, how can we afford meat?" A young man who had just gotten married said, "Now the government does not care about the people's lives at all. Factory leaders can freely go on vacation and receive subsidies, while workers in hardship are ignored." A loader from Ukraine said, "The factory director has a lot of money, but when workers encounter difficulties, he won't lend them a single ruble!" He pointed out, "The problem is that they and we are no longer of the same class."

The old men in the Kremlin, the Soviet revisionist lords, in order to cover up their crimes of restoring capitalism, actually put up the sign of "everything for people, everything for people's happiness" to deceive the Soviet working people. For example, on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, they pretended to implement the five-day workweek system in enterprises and shouted about raising the wages of low-income workers. However, this trick cannot fool the broad masses of Soviet working people who are oppressed and exploited by the bourgeois privileged class. A female worker in Moscow said, "What five-day workweek?! The production quotas are getting higher and higher, and we often have to work twelve hours a day now." Some workers said, "We cannot expect our leaders to do anything good. In name, they raise wages, but in reality, they do not raise them, because the production quotas are increased, and workers always fail to complete the tasks." A young female salesperson said, "Now everywhere here is deception... newspapers and broadcasts do not tell the truth, workers and staff do not believe it."

Hailing "Mao Tse-tung is Lenin" and "Long Live Mao Tse-tung Thought!"

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, the Soviet people deeply cherish the great proletarian revolutionary, Lenin, and the great Marxist-Leninist, Stalin, and enthusiastically praise the contemporary greatest teacher and outstanding leader of the proletariat, Chairman Mao Tse-tung.

The Soviet people cherish the historical merits of Lenin and Stalin in leading the Bolsheviks and the Soviet proletariat to open the path of the October Revolution and establish the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are extremely indignant at the small group of Soviet revisionist traitors who fiercely attack Stalin. Many people said, "Stalin defended Lenin's cause, and we all miss him." A young miner from a coal mine in Donetsk pointed out that Soviet workers strongly oppose Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others' vicious slander of Stalin. He excitedly said, "Now some people are vying to be big officials; they have said a lot, but have not done any good deeds. Stalin cared a lot about the workers' lives. During Stalin's leadership, workers' lives were good. Now, those leaders have lived well themselves but do not care about the workers' lives." He also angrily asked, "Why was Stalin moved out of the mausoleum? After being moved out, why has no monument been erected to this day?" A driver from Ukraine is very hostile to the Soviet revisionist traitors who fiercely attack Stalin. He angrily said, "Those dogs who attack Stalin will not have a good end!"

The broad masses of the Soviet revolutionary people deeply respect and love the great leader, Chairman Mao. They wholeheartedly praise the invincible Mao Tse-tung Thought. A worker from Irkutsk said, "Mao Tse-tung is correct, Mao Tse-tung is Lenin." Some said, "Chairman Mao Tse-tung is correct, with Mao Tse-tung's leadership, this is the happiness of the Chinese people and the people of the world." Some said, "Mao Tse-tung is a great leader, just like Lenin, he is the wisest person." A worker shouted, "Long Live Mao Tse-tung Thought!"

The Soviet revolutionary people enthusiastically praise the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally. A young person said, "The Soviet Union lacks a cultural revolution like China's. In the Soviet Union, some people only know about money. If the Soviet Union also carried out a cultural revolution, it would not have become like this today." An old female worker said, "We workers completely agree with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China."

The Soviet people have been fighting resolutely against the Soviet revisionist leadership for many years. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, they expressed their determination to "carry out a new revolution," "carry the struggle against revisionism to the end," and "sweep away all bourgeois filth." The true Soviet communists and people with a glorious revolutionary tradition will definitely, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Thought, take the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China as an example, thoroughly overthrow the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, and once again raise the great banner of the October Socialist Revolution across the Soviet land.

    无限怀念十月革命伟大缔造者列宁和继承者斯大林
    热烈赞颂当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛主席
    苏联人民一定会在马列主义毛泽东思想指引下，以中国无产阶级文化大革命为榜样，彻底打倒苏修集团，把十月革命的伟大旗帜重新插遍苏联大地
    据新华社六日讯　莫斯科消息：十一月七日，是伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年。广大的苏联人民在欢庆这个伟大节日的时候，越来越清楚地看到，以勃列日涅夫、柯西金为首的苏修领导集团，彻底背叛了十月革命的道路，在苏联全面实现了资本主义复辟，把旧世界的锁链重新套在苏联劳动人民的头上。苏联的革命人民愤怒地揭露和谴责苏修叛徒们的种种滔天罪行，他们无限怀念十月革命的伟大缔造者列宁及其继承者斯大林，热烈赞颂当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席。
    请听听苏联人民的声音吧！
    痛斥苏修集团背叛无产阶级专政实行资产阶级专政
    苏联人民痛斥苏修领导集团背叛无产阶级专政，实行资产阶级专政，残酷压迫、剥削劳动人民。一个老工人沉痛地说，“无产阶级专政，劳动阶级的政权，在苏联已经不存在了”。另一个工人同志说，“国家权力现在形式上属于苏联人民，实际上却掌握在人民的敌人手里”。苏联工人把苏修集团称为“资产阶级的代理人”、“资产阶级的市侩”。伊尔库次克的一位联合收割机手说，苏修集团“同人民走的是两条道路，人民往前走，他们拉着往后退；人民要革命，他们不准革命。”
    尽管苏修领导集团不厌其烦地吹嘘什么“苏维埃民主”，但是，苏联劳动人民根本谈不上享受什么民主权利，他们在政治上没有发言权，工作和生活都缺乏基本保障，随时都有被解雇的可能。从卡拉干达到莫斯科参观的一位工人说，在卡拉干达市，“为了反对解雇，工人常常举行罢工。”许多人都说，“我们普通工人是没有自由的。”一位老大娘说：“你要对厂长提出批评，马上就会遭到报复”。一位年轻小伙子说：“我们这里，人民已不是国家的主人了，一切都是当官的说了算……今天，人民好象生活在沙皇时期。”
    苏联人民根据切身的体会，揭穿了苏修集团散布的所谓他们是“列宁事业的继承者”的谎言。正如伊尔库次克一位工人所说：“勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团背叛了马克思列宁主义，背叛了列宁的道路，把苏联拉上了资本主义的道路”。有的说，今日的苏联，“赫鲁晓夫主义代替了革命的无产阶级政策”，“修正主义冒充为列宁主义”。正因为这样，在苏联到处都可以听到愤怒咒骂当代最大的修正主义者赫鲁晓夫及其继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的声音，人们认为，这些人完全是一丘之貉，“本质上一样地坏”。
    揭露苏修以“建设共产主义”为名复辟资本主义
    苏修领导集团利用“庆祝”十月革命五十周年的机会，恬不知耻地把他们的假共产主义建设、真资本主义复辟吹得天花乱坠。但这是根本欺骗不了苏联广大劳动人民的。在莫斯科和卡拉干达，在中亚细亚地区和波罗的海沿岸，广大工人普遍揭露苏联修正主义者背叛社会主义，把原来的全民所有制的社会主义企业改变成为一小撮特权阶层所有的资本主义企业。乌兹别克共和国的一位工人一针见血地指出，目前，苏联的工厂已经“不是社会主义的，而是资本主义的”企业。许多工人指出，在苏修领导集团实行以资本主义利润原则为核心的“新体制”以后，苏联的工厂企业把追求利润当成最高目标，把工人当成雇佣奴隶。他们揭发，为了追求高利润，企业的领导人什么事都干得出来：为了多赚钱，他们在生产上不惜弄虚作假，偷工减料；对工人的健康和劳动条件不闻不问，无动于衷。据纺织女工们揭露，她们的工作环境差，设备糟，劳动强度大，下班时累得精疲力尽。据苏修《汽笛报》透露，一些女工气愤地控诉，企业领导人故意让她们“干最重的活”。
    苏修集团在推行“新体制”时，大搞物质刺激，拿奖金来诱骗工人。实际上，各地企业的奖金绝大部分都被那些资产阶级当权派拿走了，而工人们却受到更残酷的剥削。乌克兰的一位老矿工谈到，他们那里的几个矿这几年一直完不成计划。但是说来也奇怪，矿长照样能拿到大量的奖金，什么节约原料、材料、节省劳动力……都有奖金。他愤怒地说：“他们同我们工人不是一个阶级的人，他们根本不管工人们的疾苦”。莫斯科一位青年技工指出：“实行‘新体制’使富的更富，穷的更穷，现在我们这里没有真理”。
    谴责苏修全面推行修正主义政策使阶级分化加剧
    由于勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团全面推行修正主义政策的结果，苏联社会上阶级分化日益加剧，贫富悬殊越来越大。资产阶级高薪阶层、特权人物过着花天酒地的生活，而劳动人民却陷入艰难困苦的境地。伊尔库次克一位联合收割机手对中国同志说：“我们工人现在收入很少，生活很苦”。在莫斯科、乌克兰、西伯利亚等地，到处都可以听到普通的劳动人民诉说：“我们这么少的工资，那能买得起肉？”一位刚刚结婚的青年说：现在政府根本不关心人民的生活。工厂的领导人可以自由地去休假，并拿补贴，而生活困苦的工人却没有人理睬。乌克兰一位装卸工说，“厂长有很多钱，但是工人遇到困难时，一个卢布也不借给你！”他指出：“问题在于，他们和我们已经不是同一个阶级的人了”。
    克里姆林宫的苏修老爷们为了掩盖他们复辟资本主义的罪行，竟然打出“一切为了人，一切为了人的幸福”的招牌来欺骗苏联劳动人民。例如，在十月革命五十周年前夕，他们装装样子，声称在企业中实行什么五天工作周制度，叫嚷要提高低薪人员的工资。可是，这一套是瞒不过备受资产阶级特权阶层压迫、剥削的苏联广大劳动人民的。莫斯科一个女工说：“什么五天工作周？！生产定额越来越高，我们现在经常一天要干十二个小时”。有的工人说：“不能指望我们的那些领导人能做出什么真正的好事来。名义上是提高工资，实际上等于没提高，因为生产定额提高了，工人们总是完不成任务。”一位青年女售货员说：“我们这里现在到处是欺骗……报刊和广播不讲真话，工人和职员们都不相信。”
    欢呼“毛泽东就是列宁”“毛泽东思想必胜！”
    在纪念十月革命五十周年的时候，苏联人民深深怀念伟大的无产阶级革命家列宁和伟大的马克思列宁主义者斯大林，热烈称颂当代无产阶级最伟大的导师和最杰出的领袖毛泽东主席。
    苏联人民缅怀列宁和斯大林领导布尔什维克党和苏联无产阶级，开创十月革命的道路，建立无产阶级专政的历史功勋。他们对一小撮苏修叛徒大反斯大林的做法，极为愤慨。许多人都说：“斯大林捍卫了列宁的事业，我们都想念他。”顿涅茨克某煤矿的一位青年矿工指出，苏联工人强烈反对赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流恶毒诽谤斯大林。他激动地说：“现在有些人争当大官，他们说了不少话，但什么好事也没有做。斯大林非常关心工人的生活。在斯大林领导时期，工人的生活很好。而今，那些领导人自己生活好了，却不管工人死活。”他还气愤地质问说：“为什么把斯大林从陵墓中移走？移出之后，为什么到现在连纪念碑都不立呢？”乌克兰一位司机对大反斯大林的苏修叛徒们非常仇恨，他气愤地说：“反斯大林的那些狗东西绝没有好下场！”
    广大的苏联革命人民无限崇敬和热爱伟大领袖毛主席，衷心赞扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想。伊尔库次克一位工人说：“毛泽东正确，毛泽东就是列宁。”有的说，“毛泽东主席正确，有毛泽东领导，这是中国人民和世界人民的幸福。”有的说，“毛泽东是伟大的领袖，同列宁一样，他是最有智慧的人。”一位工人高呼：“毛泽东思想必胜！”
    苏联革命人民热烈赞扬由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命。一位青年说：“苏联就是缺少象中国那样的文化大革命。在苏联，有些人只知道钱。假如苏联也搞文化大革命，那就不致变成今天这个样子了。”一位老年女工说：“我们工人们完全同意中国无产阶级文化大革命。”
    苏联人民多年来一直在同苏修领导集团进行着坚决的斗争，在十月社会主义革命五十周年之际，他们纷纷表示“要来一次新的革命”，“把反对修正主义的斗争进行到底”，“荡涤一切资产阶级污秽”。具有光荣革命传统的真正的苏联共产党人和苏联人民，一定会在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，以中国无产阶级文化大革命为榜样，把苏修叛徒集团彻底打倒，把十月社会主义革命的伟大旗帜重新插遍苏联大地。
