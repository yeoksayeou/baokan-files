In the infamous novel *The Living and the Dead*, there is a character named Sherpilin.

This Sherpilin is extremely hostile towards the great leader of the Soviet people, Stalin. He curses Stalin for being "blindly optimistic" and "incompetent" during the Great Patriotic War, blaming him for the war's failures and setbacks, calling him the "arch-criminal."

This Sherpilin always boasts about the fascist invaders, and even at the start of the Great Patriotic War, he praised the fascists, saying their "army is strong" and their "tactics are superior," using this to intimidate the Soviet people and army.

This Sherpilin harbors deep hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Whenever he thinks of the purges, he "grinds his teeth in anger," cursing it as "terrifying."

This guy is a thorough counter-revolutionary!

Chairman Mao teaches us that we must "implement dictatorship over the reactionaries," "not do so, and the revolution will fail, the people will suffer, and the country will perish." Under Stalin's correct leadership, the Soviet people, in the 1937 purges, implemented dictatorship over counter-revolutionaries like Sherpilin. This action was excellent!

However, in *The Living and the Dead*, Simonov fabricates facts, distorts right and wrong, and attempts to rehabilitate this counter-revolutionary. He portrays this coward, who was scared by the "superiority" of the German army, as a "hero" who defeated the fascists on the Western Front; he praises this counter-revolutionary as a "great leader" who can withstand any "tribulations" and has served the revolution all his life. In Simonov's depiction, Sherpilin, this counter-revolutionary, becomes a pillar of the Great Patriotic War, a backbone and core of the victory over the fascists. This is completely a song of praise and a monument to the counter-revolution.

Through rehabilitating Sherpilin, Simonov has launched a vicious attack on the dictatorship of the proletariat. He rants about how the dictatorship of the proletariat "persecuted" and "destroyed" Sherpilin, causing the Soviet Union to lose a large number of such "outstanding figures." Sherpilin was only sentenced to ten years for once mentioning the "superior tactical views" of the Hitler army, and this "wrongful imprisonment" made him "aged" and "weakened."

Shut up, traitor Simonov! Do not attack the dictatorship of the proletariat! Who hates the dictatorship of the proletariat so much? It is the Trotskyites, the counter-revolutionary ruffians, the bloodthirsty bourgeoisie! Simonov is the faithful spokesman of these counter-revolutionary ruffians and bloodthirsty bourgeoisie!

After the Soviet revisionist traitor clique came to power, to organize counter-revolutionary forces in the Soviet Union and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration, they openly cried out for the Trotskyites, traitors, spies, and various counter-revolutionaries who were suppressed by the Soviet power in the past. In recent years, the novels of rehabilitation have flooded the Soviet revisionist literary scene, which are the products of the political needs of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique. Simonov's rehabilitation of the counter-revolutionary Sherpilin in *The Living and the Dead* is also serving this political need.

We absolutely do not allow Simonov to rehabilitate counter-revolutionaries. A ghost is a ghost, and a ghost can never become a person!

    不许西蒙诺夫为反革命分子翻案
    解放军某部五好战士　万海勤
    在臭名昭著的长篇小说《生者与死者》中，有一个名叫谢尔皮林的人物。
    这个谢尔皮林，极端仇视苏联人民的伟大领袖斯大林，咒骂斯大林在卫国战争中“盲目乐观”，“昏庸无能”，是战争失利和挫折的“罪魁祸首”。
    这个谢尔皮林，一贯吹嘘法西斯德寇，甚至在卫国战争爆发的时候，还为法西斯吹牛，说它的“军队强大”，“战术优越”，以此来恐吓苏联人民和军队。
    这个谢尔皮林，对无产阶级专政充满着刻骨仇恨，一想起肃反，就“恼怒得咬牙切齿”，咒骂它搞得“骇人听闻”。
    这个家伙是个地地道道的反革命分子！
    毛主席教导我们，对于反动派必须“实行专政，实行独裁”，“不这样，革命就要失败，人民就要遭殃，国家就要灭亡。”苏联人民在斯大林的正确领导下，在一九三七年的肃反运动中，对谢尔皮林这样的反革命实行了专政，进行了独裁，这个行动好得很！
    可是，西蒙诺夫在《生者与死者》里，却捏造事实，颠倒黑白，为这个反革命翻案。他把这个被德军“优势”吓破了胆的软骨头，描写成一个在西线战场战胜了德寇的“英雄”；把这个反革命吹嘘成一个经得起任何“摧折”，一生都“按照军人的天职，尽力为革命服务”的“优秀将领”。在西蒙诺夫笔下，谢尔皮林这个反革命变成了卫国战争的中流砥柱，成了战胜德寇的中坚和骨干。这完全是为反革命歌功颂德，树碑立传。
    西蒙诺夫通过为谢尔皮林翻案，对无产阶级专政进行了恶毒的攻击。他胡说什么无产阶级专政“迫害”和“摧残”了谢尔皮林，使苏联失去了大批象他这样的“优秀人物”。谢尔皮林只是因为曾经说过希特勒国防军“战术观点的优越性”，就被判了十年徒刑，这场“冤狱”使他“变得苍老了，体力衰竭了”。
    住口，可耻的叛徒西蒙诺夫！不许你攻击无产阶级专政！是什么人才对无产阶级专政这样仇恨？是托洛茨基分子，是反革命恶棍，是资产阶级的嗜血鬼！西蒙诺夫就是这些反革命恶棍和资产阶级嗜血鬼的忠实代言人！
    苏修叛徒集团上台以后，为了在苏联组织反革命队伍，进行反革命复辟，公然为过去被苏维埃政权镇压了的托洛茨基分子、叛徒、特务和形形色色的反革命分子喊冤叫屈，招魂翻案。近几年来，苏修文坛上的翻案小说纷纷出笼，就是苏修叛徒集团这种政治需要的产物。西蒙诺夫在《生者与死者》中公开为反革命分子谢尔皮林翻案，也是为这种政治需要服务的。
    我们绝对不允许西蒙诺夫为反革命分子翻案，鬼就是鬼，鬼永远也变不成人！
