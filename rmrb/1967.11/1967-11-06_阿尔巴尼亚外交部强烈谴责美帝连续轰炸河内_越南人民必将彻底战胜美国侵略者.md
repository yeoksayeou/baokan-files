The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of Albania issued a statement on November 4, strongly condemning the savage crime of the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of the capital city of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Hanoi, and expressing resolute support for the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression.

The statement said that the people and government of Albania, with deep indignation, condemn the savage crime of the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of Hanoi and its suburbs.

In their heroic struggle, the heroic Vietnamese people have continuously achieved victories, inflicting incalculable losses on the U.S. aggressors. In an attempt to extricate themselves from their current extremely serious predicament, the U.S. imperialists are trying to impose their malicious plot of "negotiations" on the Vietnamese people, using tactics of intensified bombing to apply pressure, and shouting "stop the bombing" to deceive public opinion. The U.S. imperialists, while shouting for "negotiations," are plotting further expansion of their aggression against Vietnam, intensifying their war of aggression in South Vietnam, and escalating their bombing of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The U.S. aim is to use deception and force to compel the Vietnamese people to surrender to the U.S. aggressors.

The statement pointed out that in their attempt to realize this vicious plan, the U.S. imperialists are using the active help and support of the Soviet revisionist leadership. The Soviet revisionist leadership, which betrays the vital interests of the Vietnamese people, is desperately trying to force the Vietnamese people to give up their just struggle and agree to negotiate with the U.S. aggressors. It is necessary to strongly expose and resolutely reject this plot of imperialism and revisionism.

The heroic Vietnamese people, who have fought bravely for decades and have rich experience in the anti-imperialist struggle, will never yield to pressure and will never become victims of the imperialist and revisionist "negotiation" trick. The indomitable will and unshakable determination of the fraternal Vietnamese people to thoroughly smash the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory are invincible.

The statement pointed out that the Vietnamese issue can only be resolved on the basis of the correct demands proposed in the four-point program of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point declaration of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. The statement concluded by saying that the people and government of Albania have stood and will always stand with the heroic Vietnamese people. The people and government of Albania fully believe that the Vietnamese people will surely achieve a thorough victory over the U.S. imperialist aggressors.

    阿尔巴尼亚外交部强烈谴责美帝连续轰炸河内
    越南人民必将彻底战胜美国侵略者
    新华社地拉那五日电  据阿尔巴尼亚通讯社报道：阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国外交部四日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义连续轰炸越南民主共和国首都河内市的野蛮罪行，并表示坚决支持越南人民抗击美国侵略者的正义斗争。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚政府怀着万分愤慨的心情，谴责美帝国主义连续轰炸河内市及其郊区的野蛮罪行。
    英雄的越南人民在英勇的斗争中不断地取得胜利，使美国侵略者遭受到无法估计的损失。美帝国主义为了摆脱目前陷入的极为严重的困境，妄图把它进行的“和谈”的恶毒阴谋强加给越南人民，时而用加强轰炸以施加压力的伎俩，时而大喊大叫“停止轰炸”来进行蛊惑人心的宣传。美帝国主义者就是在叫嚷“和谈”的时候，策划进一步扩大对越南的侵略阴谋，强化在越南南方的侵略战争和加紧轰炸越南民主共和国。美帝的目的是通过欺骗和武力这两手来迫使越南人民向美国侵略者投降。
    声明指出：美帝国主义者在妄图实现这种毒辣计划时，利用苏修领导集团的极力帮助和支持。出卖越南人民切身利益的苏修领导集团拚命迫使越南人民放弃自己的正义斗争和同意到谈判桌上同美国侵略者谈判。必须有力地揭露和坚决摈斥帝国主义和修正主义的这种阴谋。
    奋勇斗争几十年和取得了反帝斗争丰富经验的英雄的越南人民，永远也不会向压力屈服，永远不会成为帝国主义、修正主义“和谈”骗局的牺牲品。兄弟的越南人民彻底粉碎美国侵略者和赢得最后胜利的钢铁意志和坚定不移的决心，是不可战胜的。
    声明指出，越南问题只能在越南民主共和国四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线五点声明中提出的正确要求的基础上加以解决。声明最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府过去和现在永远同英雄的越南人民站在一起。阿尔巴尼亚人民和政府表示完全相信，越南人民必将彻底战胜美帝国主义侵略者。
