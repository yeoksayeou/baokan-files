In the midst of the nationwide movement to resume classes and carry out revolution in primary, secondary, and higher education, our most beloved leader Chairman Mao issued new directives on educational revolution: "To carry out a proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad masses of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers, and rely on the activists among them, that is, those who are determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end." Chairman Mao's latest directives have shown us the way forward and given us boundless strength. We must study them thoroughly, understand them deeply, and implement them resolutely.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards of Shandong Medical College have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's great directive to "revolutionize education." Since mid-September, we have fully resumed classes and carried out revolution, deeply engaging in revolutionary criticism, taking "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself" as our guiding principle, and conducting struggle, criticism, and transformation within our institution. Through our teaching practice, we have been reforming while teaching.

After resuming classes and carrying out revolution, our college first mobilized all revolutionary teachers and students to launch a revolutionary criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational and health work lines promoted by China's Khrushchev and his agents in the educational and health sectors. Revolutionary teachers and students exposed and criticized many aspects of medical education that deviated from Chairman Mao's educational line and opposed Mao Zedong Thought: such as focusing only on professional skills and neglecting politics; medical personnel staying in cities and not going to the countryside; long academic terms, with five years not being enough and plans to extend to six; overly specialized subjects, with basic courses, "bridge courses," and clinical courses, and even surgery divided into urology, thoracic surgery, orthopedics, and pediatric surgery, leading to a disconnect between theory and practice, and sometimes even inability to perform minor surgeries after graduation; neglecting common and prevalent diseases in rural areas, not allocating sufficient human and material resources to solve the problems most needed by the masses, but instead focusing on rare and unusual diseases; lacking interest in prevention, focusing only on treatment. In short, the medical and health work did not prioritize rural areas and did not follow the great strategic principle of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." By breaking down these issues and conducting a revolutionary criticism closely tied to our institution's actual situation, we have laid a solid foundation for our educational reforms.

In April, we sent several educational revolution exploration teams, composed of revolutionary students, teachers, and cadres, to the countryside to explore a path for medical education that prioritizes rural medical and health work. After four months of investigation and research, we organized a major debate on the purpose of medical education and how to reform the medical education system, using them as the core. During the debate, all revolutionary teachers and students repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works, such as "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and clearly recognized that our medical college must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and cultivate workers with socialist consciousness, culture, and labor skills. This first requires us to shift our focus to the vast rural areas and the five hundred million peasants, and in practice, create a new proletarian medical education system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

With the direction clear, the broad revolutionary teachers and students discussed how to face the countryside. During the college-wide debate, the "June 26" educational revolution exploration team was established. They decided to be the vanguard of the educational revolution, immediately going to the countryside to prevent and treat diseases for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, transforming their worldviews and mastering a set of solid skills to prevent and treat common and prevalent rural diseases. The departure of the "June 26" educational revolution exploration team caused a great stir throughout the college. Revolutionary teachers and students quickly established the second and third "June 26" educational revolution exploration teams. They decided to go to the countryside and forge a brand new path for the development of proletarian medical education.

In the past, the textbooks used in medical education were mostly written by reactionary academic "authorities," filled with idealism and metaphysics, and were numerous and杂乱, not meeting the needs of the current educational revolution. To overcome this phenomenon, we mobilized the masses to organize revolutionary teachers and students to compile new textbooks, emphasizing quality over quantity, and focusing medical and health work on rural areas. Teachers went to revolutionary students, organized into platoons, and established teaching groups composed of teachers and students. This not only facilitates the educational revolution but also helps teachers overcome some incorrect ideas in their minds, which is of great significance in building a team of teachers who can cultivate successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and have a revolutionary spirit.

Chairman Mao's latest directives have greatly encouraged and strengthened us. We resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's great call, determined to further mobilize all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, boldly break with the old, and boldly innovate, contributing our efforts to creating a new proletarian medical education system that shines with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

    面向农村，闯出医学教育的新路
    山东医学院革命委员会
    在全国大、中、小学复课闹革命的热潮中，我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席对教育革命发出了最新指示：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席的这个最新指示，给我们指明了方向，给了我们无穷的力量。我们一定认真学习，深刻领会，坚决照办。
    山东医学院的无产阶级革命派和红卫兵，坚决贯彻毛主席“教育要革命”的伟大指示，于九月中旬全面复课闹革命，深入开展革命的大批判，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进行本单位的斗批改。我们通过教学实践，一边进行教学，一边进行改革。
    我院在开始复课闹革命以后，首先发动全院革命师生，对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在教育卫生界的代理人在医学教育中推行的反革命修正主义的教育路线和卫生工作路线，展开了一场革命的大批判。革命师生揭露和批判了医学教育中许多违反毛主席教育路线和反对毛泽东思想的东西：如只讲业务，不讲政治；医务人员蹲在城市里，不下农村；学制长，五年不行，还要改为六年；分科细，有基础课、“桥梁课”、临床课，一门外科又分为泌尿外科、胸腔外科、骨外科、小儿外科等，以致理论与实际脱节，出了学校门，有时连小手术也做不来；对农村常见病和多发病，不教不学，不把大量的人力物力放在群众最需要解决的问题上，而是在罕见病、稀有病上大下功夫；对预防不感兴趣，只讲治疗。总之一句话，就是不把医药卫生工作重点放在农村，不从“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针出发。不破不立，这样密切结合本单位实际情况的革命大批判，就为我院的教育改革作了很好的准备。
    今年四月，我们派出了有革命学生、革命教师和革命干部相结合的几个教育革命探索队，深入到农村，去探索一条把医药卫生重点放到农村去的医学教育的路子。经过四个月的调查研究之后，又以他们为骨干，在本院开展了一场医学教育为什么人服务和医学教育制度怎么改革的大辩论。在辩论中，全院革命师生反复学习了毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》等光辉著作，明确认识到我们医学院就是要为工农兵服务，培养为工农兵服务的、有社会主义觉悟的、有文化的劳动者。这就首先要求我们把立足点转向广大农村，转向五亿农民，在实践中创造出一套闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级新型的医学教育制度来。
    方向明确了，广大革命师生又讨论了如何面向农村的问题。在全院大辩论过程中，一支“六·二六”教育革命探索队成立了。他们决心做教育革命的开路先锋，立即到农村去，在为广大贫下中农防病治病中，改造自己的世界观，同时学会一套能防治农村常见病、多发病的过硬本领。“六·二六”教育革命探索队的出发，在全院引起了极大的震动，革命师生很快成立了第二个、第三个“六·二六”教育革命探索队。他们决心走向农村，闯出一条崭新的无产阶级的医学教育发展的道路。
    过去，医学教育所用的教材，多半出自反动学术“权威”之手，其中充满了唯心主义、形而上学的东西，并且多而杂，不符合当前教育革命的需要。为了克服这种现象，我们又在发动群众的基础上，组织革命教师和革命学生一起动手编写新的教材，突出地体现了少而精，把医药卫生重点放到农村去的要求。教师到革命学生中去，按照连队编制，建立师生结合在一起的教学小组。这样，不仅有利于教育革命，也有利于教员们克服头脑里的一些不正确的东西，这对于建立一支能够培养出无产阶级革命事业接班人、思想革命化的教师队伍，是有重要意义的。
    毛主席的最新指示给了我们极大鼓舞和力量。我们坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，决心进一步把全院革命师生员工充分发动起来，大胆破旧，大胆创新，为创建出一套闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的无产阶级新型的医学教育制度贡献出自己的一份力量。
