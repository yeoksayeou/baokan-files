In the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, Hunan Province has seen a surge in revolutionary criticism and revolutionary unity. There is a high tide of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes, actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promoting production while advancing the revolution. The situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the entire province is better than ever, surpassing any previous period.

Currently, from the winding Wuling Mountains to the vast shores of Dongting Lake, from cities to remote villages, the air is filled with the angry denunciations of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Hunan. Every factory, office, school, military unit, and people's commune, even every household, is discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, with everyone concerned about national affairs. Many units have everyone speaking out and writing, using both words and pens to criticize, setting up a battlefield for revolutionary criticism. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have been exposed and are now like rats crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat them.

Revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres across the province, following the strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao, have launched a wave of revolutionary unity during the revolutionary criticism. After learning from Chairman Mao's important instructions during his inspections of North China, Central-South China, and East China, revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in Changsha City achieved revolutionary unity in over 360 units and systems within a few days, which has now increased to over 600. Eight revolutionary mass organizations in Xiangtan City, after thorough consultations, have united on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, eliminated factionalism, and achieved revolutionary unity. In Shaoyang City, over 90% of units and systems have achieved revolutionary unity and established a preparatory group for the Shaoyang Revolutionary Committee. Revolutionary cadres in Zhuzhou City have also taken action, launching a wave of revolutionary unity. The four major organizations in Hunan—"Changsha Workers' Federation," "Xiangjiang Thunder," "Changsha Workers," and "Youth Guards"—recently issued a "Joint Announcement," deciding to prepare for the establishment of a workers' congress to further promote revolutionary unity in Hunan Province.

After the great leader Chairman Mao issued the call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, cities and countryside across the province quickly and extensively established numerous Mao Zedong Thought study classes and self-criticism and anti-revisionism lectures, launching an unprecedented wave of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works. The preparatory group of the Hunan Revolutionary Committee and the 69000 Unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have held two sessions of the provincial-level "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought study class, and are now preparing for the third session. Nearly a thousand leaders from revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, military sub-districts, and people's armed departments from various prefectures and counties across the province have participated in this study class. Through self-criticism and anti-revisionism, this study class has significantly promoted the ideological transformation of revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations in various places, enhanced their mutual understanding, and further promoted revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination" in various places. Many prefectures and counties have also followed the experience of the provincial Mao Zedong Thought study class and extensively established "three-in-one combination" Mao Zedong Thought study classes at the prefecture and county levels. Various factories, schools, offices, and people's communes across the province, as well as some workshops, teams, and production brigades in factories and communes, have also established study classes. Through the extensive establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes, the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought has been further established.

The development of the revolutionary situation has powerfully promoted production, and industrial and agricultural production across the province has presented an unprecedentedly good situation. From January to September this year, steel production increased by 6.9% compared to the same period last year, iron production increased by 9.2%, machine tool production increased by 37.4%, and electricity generation increased by 13.5%. Other key products such as coal, pesticides, cotton cloth, soap, and machine-made paper have all exceeded the levels of the same period last year. Since October, the production of many factories has surged. In terms of transportation, the volume of long-distance cargo transportation in September increased by 25% compared to August, and in October, it increased by more than 20% compared to September. In agriculture, after the early and mid-season rice harvests were generally successful, the late-season rice harvest in the entire province is now guaranteed. Important economic crops such as cotton, hemp, and tea also have better yields than last year.

The emergence of the great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province is inseparable from the strong support of the Chinese People's Liberation Army fighting on the front lines of the "three supports and two militaries" in Hunan. The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army executing the "three supports and two militaries" tasks have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, with the most resolute actions defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, actively supporting the broad leftist masses, enthusiastically arming the revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and helping the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary cadres to continuously grow and strengthen. Over the past year, the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have made outstanding contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Hunan Province. They have fought side by side with the broad revolutionary masses, forging a deep combat friendship. The army loves the people, and the people support the army, making the military-civilian relationship even more intimate.

    湖南省文化大革命形势空前大好
    出现了革命大批判、革命大联合、大办毛泽东思想学习班、活学活用毛主席著作和抓革命促生产的高潮
    新华社长沙十七日电　在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，湖南省出现了革命大批判和革命大联合的高潮，出现了大办毛泽东思想学习班、活学活用毛主席著作和抓革命、促生产的高潮。全省无产阶级文化大革命的形势空前大好，比以往任何时候都好。
    现在，从逶迤的五岭山下到辽阔的洞庭湖滨，从城市到边远山村，到处响彻着对中国赫鲁晓夫及其在湖南的代理人的愤怒声讨声。每个工厂、机关、学校、部队、农村人民公社以至每个家庭，都在讨论无产阶级文化大革命的问题，大家都在关心国家大事。许多单位人人动口，个个动笔，口诛笔伐，摆开了革命大批判的战场。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经被揪了出来，暴露在光天化日之下，成了过街的老鼠，人人喊打。
    全省各地无产阶级革命派和革命群众，紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，在革命大批判中掀起了革命大联合的高潮。长沙市的无产阶级革命派和革命群众，学习了毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的重要指示以后，几天之内就有三百六十多个单位和系统实现了革命的大联合，现在已增加到了六百多个。湘潭市的八大革命群众组织，经过充分协商，在毛泽东思想的基础上，铲平了山头，实现了革命的大联合。在邵阳市，百分之九十以上的单位和系统已经实现了革命的大联合，并成立了邵阳地区革命委员会筹备小组。株洲市的革命派也闻风而动，掀起了革命大联合的高潮。湖南“长沙工联”、“湘江风雷”、“长沙工人”、“青年近卫军”四大组织，最近发布“联合公告”，决定着手筹建工代会，推动湖南省的革命大联合进一步向前发展。
    伟大领袖毛主席发出要斗私，批修的伟大战斗号召以后，全省城乡迅速地、广泛地办起了大批的毛泽东思想学习班和斗私批修讲用会，掀起了一个前所未有的活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。湖南省革命委员会筹备小组和中国人民解放军六九○○部队举办的全省性的“三结合”毛泽东思想学习班，已经办完了两期，现在正在筹办第三期。全省各专区、县革命群众组织的负责人，革命的领导干部，军分区和人民武装部的领导干部近一千人，参加了这个学习班的学习。这个学习班通过斗私批修，对于促进各地革命领导干部和革命群众组织负责人的思想革命化，增进他们之间的相互了解，从而进一步促进各地的革命大联合和革命三结合，收到了显著的效果。许多专、县也按照省毛泽东思想学习班的经验，普遍举办了全专区和全县性的“三结合”毛泽东思想学习班。全省各地的许多厂矿、学校、机关、农村人民公社以至有的工厂的车间、班组和农村人民公社的生产大队，也办起了学习班。通过大办毛泽东思想学习班，进一步树立了毛主席的绝对权威，树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    革命形势的发展有力地推动了生产，全省工农业生产也呈现出一派空前大好的形势。今年一至九月份，钢产量比去年同期增长百分之六点九，铁产量增长百分之九点二，机床产量增长百分之三十七点四，发电量增长百分之十三点五。其他如煤、农药、棉布、肥皂、机制纸等重点产品都超过了去年同期水平。十月份以来，许多工厂的生产更是大幅度上升。在交通运输方面，九月份全省长途货运量比八月份增加百分之二十五，十月份又比九月份增加二成以上。农业生产，继早、中稻普遍获得丰收之后，全省晚稻丰收已成定局。棉、麻、茶等重要经济作物也比去年收成好。
    湖南省无产阶级文化大革命大好形势的出现，是同战斗在湖南“三支”“两军”第一线的中国人民解放军的大力支援分不开的。执行“三支”“两军”任务的人民解放军指战员，坚定不移地站在毛主席革命路线一边，以最果敢的行动保卫毛主席的革命路线，积极支持左派广大群众，热情地用毛泽东思想武装革命群众，帮助无产阶级革命派的队伍得到了不断的发展壮大。一年多来，人民解放军广大指战员为湖南省的文化大革命作出了卓越的贡献，他们和广大革命群众并肩战斗，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。军爱民，民拥军，军民关系更加亲密无间了。
