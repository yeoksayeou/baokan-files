The sprouts rejoice in the dew, the sunflowers turn towards the sun; the revolutionary people of Dazhai love Chairman Mao's thought with all their hearts. This is Comrade Chen Yonggui, the secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Committee and a good student of Chairman Mao (fourth from the left), and the model workers of Dazhai, using the gaps in the "three autumns" to study the "Quotations from Chairman Mao."

Sweep the "self" out the door, let the "public" settle in. The Shanxi garrison of the People's Liberation Army supports the "three autumns" in Dazhai, and together with the Dazhai commune members, holds a self-criticism and criticism of revisionism meeting, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fight against the "self" and establish the "public."

"Joyfully watching the waves of rice and beans, heroes everywhere under the evening smoke." Under the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the red flag on the agricultural front of our country—Dazhai Brigade of Dazhai Commune in Xiyang County, Shanxi Province—has brought the news of a bumper harvest. The Dazhai commune members excitedly say: We will pave a golden road with corn, straight to the great capital's Tiananmen Square! This is a corner of the Dazhai courtyard.

The golden ears of grain are heavy, and the songs of harvest are endless. Dazhai model worker Guo Fenglian is busy harvesting in the field.

The army loves the people, the people support the army, the army and the people are like fish and water. The People's Liberation Army, which has made immortal contributions in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is determined to establish new merits in "supporting agriculture." This is the soldiers of a certain unit of the Shanxi garrison of the People's Liberation Army helping the Dazhai Brigade with harvesting.

Who wouldn't be delighted to see such plump corn! Dazhai has achieved a bumper harvest this year, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a great victory of the great leader Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production"!

Weigh it, measure it, each grain is plump and fragrant. Comrade Chen Yonggui, a good student of Chairman Mao, is inspecting the harvested grain according to Chairman Mao's great instruction to "grasp grain tightly," preparing to deliver the dried, winnowed, and plump grain to the state.

The whole country learns from Dazhai, what will Dazhai do? The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai say well: We are determined to muster even greater enthusiasm to "grasp revolution, promote production," and strive for an even greater harvest next year! This is the Dazhai commune members making the most of the time to plow the terraced fields.

    农业学大寨
    ——大寨今年获得特大丰收（图片）
    禾苗喜雨露，葵花向太阳；大寨革命人民无限热爱毛泽东思想。这是毛主席的好学生、大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵同志（左四）和大寨的标兵们，利用“三秋”空隙时间学习《毛主席语录》。
    把“私”字扫地出门，让“公”字安家落户。人民解放军山西驻军某部在大寨支援“三秋”，和大寨社员们共同举办斗私批修讲用会，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字。

    “喜看稻菽千重浪，遍地英雄下夕烟。”在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，我国农业战线上的红旗——山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队，传来了特大丰收的喜讯。大寨社员兴奋地说：我们要用玉米铺一条金色的大道，直通伟大的首都天安门广场！图为大寨场院的一角。
    金黄的谷穗沉甸甸，丰收的歌儿唱不完。大寨标兵郭凤莲正在田里忙着收获。
    军爱民，民拥军，军民鱼水一家人。在无产阶级文化大革命中立下不朽功勋的中国人民解放军，决心在“支农”中为人民立新功。这是人民解放军山西驻军某部指战员帮助大寨大队收割归来。
    这么饱满的玉米，谁个看了不欢喜！大寨今年获得了特大丰收，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的胜利！
    掂一掂，量一量，颗颗饱满粒粒香。毛主席的好学生陈永贵同志遵照毛主席“必须把粮食抓紧”的伟大指示，正在查看丰收的谷子，准备把晒干扬净、粒粒饱满的粮食交售给国家。
    全国学大寨，大寨怎么办？大寨的贫下中农说得好：我们决心鼓足更大的干劲“抓革命，促生产”，为夺取明年更大的丰收而奋斗！这是大寨社员正在抓紧时机翻耕梯田。
