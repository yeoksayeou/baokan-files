For the past seventeen years, the Central Academy of Fine Arts has been under the control of bourgeois experts, failing to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and not serving them. Instead, it has promoted bourgeois, revisionist, and feudal ideologies. These reactionary practices have been resisted by the broad revolutionary teachers and students, who have proposed many educational reform plans. However, these were suppressed under the revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out that "education must be revolutionized." Recently, he has given us new instructions on the educational revolution. Chairman Mao's instructions are like a resounding bell, shaking the earth. All revolutionary teachers and students in our academy are greatly inspired and determined to bring about a thorough change in the Central Academy of Fine Arts in this educational revolution, and to persistently fight for a new type of socialist art education and revolutionary art.

In the past, the broad revolutionary teachers and students in our academy have repeatedly requested to organize art teams to go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers to establish schools, but this has not been realized. Since the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary teachers and students have voluntarily organized themselves to go to the countryside, factories, and military units, working together with the workers, peasants, and soldiers to create art and explore experiences in educational reform. Recently, our academy has resumed classes and launched a revolution. The first thing we did was to open a short-term Chairman Mao portrait learning class for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The first session has more than twenty workers enrolled. The worker comrades are very excited and say, "This is a new victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" We plan to open such learning classes at the grassroots level (factories, rural areas, or military units), where students can study full-time for a short period or part-time. This method of schooling can closely combine with the current class struggle and cultivate and improve a large number of workers, peasants, and soldiers with artistic talents.

We believe that the art education revolution and the art revolution must be considered simultaneously. We have an initial idea that art organizations and art academies should be reorganized into art teams that combine revolution, creation, and teaching. These teams should go to the forefront of the three great revolutionary struggles, to the factories, rural areas, and military units, to integrate with the workers, peasants, and soldiers, participate in production labor, train as soldiers, criticize the bourgeoisie, reform their thoughts, create art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, use creation to lead teaching, learn in practice, and cultivate proletarian artistic talents. Only such schools can truly implement Chairman Mao's educational policy of learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, criticizing the bourgeoisie.

In this way, we can transform bourgeois schools that are controlled by bourgeois intellectuals and practice closed-door teaching into a new type of art team that serves the workers, peasants, and soldiers in the three great revolutionary struggles, thereby opening up a new situation for the art revolution.

    到工农兵中间去办学
    中央美术学院教改小组
    十七年来，中央美术学院基本上在资产阶级专家控制之下，不同工农兵结合，不为工农兵服务；相反地大搞资产阶级、修正主义以及封建主义的一套。这些反动的作法，曾经遭到广大革命师生的抵制，许多人提出过教育改革的方案，但是在中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线的统治下被扼杀了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就指出“教育要革命”；最近，又向我们发出了关于教育革命的最新指示。毛主席的指示，象宏亮的钟声，震撼大地。我们全院革命师生受到极大的鼓舞，决心在这场教育革命中，使中央美术学院来个翻天覆地的变化，为社会主义的新型美术教育和革命的美术进行坚持不懈的斗争。
    过去，我们学院广大革命师生曾经多次要求组织美术工作队，到工农兵中间去办学，一直没有实现。文化大革命以来，革命师生自动组织起来，下乡下厂下连队，同工农兵一起搞创作，探索教改的经验。最近，我们学院复课闹革命，第一件事就是为工农兵开办短期的毛主席画像学习班，第一期有二十多名工人已经入学。工人同志们非常激动地说：“这是毛主席革命路线的新胜利！”这样的学习班，我们还准备到基层（工厂、农村或部队）去办，学员可以短期脱产学习或业余学习。这种办学的方法，可以紧密地配合当前的阶级斗争，可以大量培养和提高工农兵美术人材。
    我们认为，艺术教育革命和艺术革命必须同时考虑。大家有个初步设想，艺术团体和艺术院校应当重新组合，成为革命、创作和教学结合在一起的美术工作队。这种工作队要到三大革命斗争的最前线去，到工厂、农村、部队去，与工农兵相结合，参加生产劳动，当兵练武，批判资产阶级，改造思想，为工农兵创作，以创作带教学，在实践中学习，培养无产阶级的美术人材。这样的学校，才能真正贯彻执行毛主席所提出的学工、学农、学军，批判资产阶级的教育方针。
    这样，就能把资产阶级知识分子统治的、关门教学的资产阶级学校，改变成在三大革命斗争中为工农兵服务的，一支新型的美术工作队，从而开创艺术革命的新生面。
