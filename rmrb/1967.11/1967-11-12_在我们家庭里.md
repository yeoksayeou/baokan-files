In Our Family

Five Good Soldiers Zhang Youzhong

Recently, I received a letter from my eldest sister, followed by letters from my elder brother, second brother, and second sister. In their letters, each of them accused the others of being on the wrong side, insisting that they themselves were correct.

My eldest sister wrote: "During this Cultural Revolution, our family has split into two factions. My husband and I, along with your second brother, second sister-in-law, and elder sister-in-law, form one faction. Your elder brother, second sister-in-law, and second sister form the other faction. Everyone claims to be firmly standing on the side of the revolutionary faction led by Chairman Mao."

Later, my second brother also wrote: "Now, our family, like society, has two distinct factions. Your elder brother and second sister argue with us whenever they see us, as if there's a wall between us."

Based on the letters from home, I studied Chairman Mao's relevant teachings with questions in mind. I think that although there is a "wall" of petty-bourgeois factionalism between them, their letters reflect a common desire: they all say they want to closely follow the great leader Chairman Mao. They are subjectively eager to actively participate in the Cultural Revolution. Therefore, the "wall" of petty-bourgeois factionalism among them can certainly be thoroughly broken down with the sharp weapon of proletarian party spirit and invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

So, I actively wrote letters, using Chairman Mao's teachings to enlighten them, urging them to consciously use the formula of "unity—criticism and self-criticism—unity" as a guideline, to carry out democratic discussions, and conduct self-criticism. At the same time, I helped them see the situation clearly, aim at the target, and concentrate all their hatred on the top capitalist roader within the Party, resolutely carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

Just at this time, I heard from the radio Chairman Mao's latest directive: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two hostile factions." I wrote to my brothers and sisters and sisters-in-law to study the latest directive. They immediately conducted a study and discussion, expressing their thousandfold support and ten-thousandfold implementation of Chairman Mao's directive, resolutely tearing down the "wall" of petty-bourgeois factionalism. Through discussions, the "two factions" in our family, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, achieved revolutionary "unity."

Not long after our family's "unity," my elder brother wrote that a "demolition wind" had blown in from somewhere, saying that the two factions in society could not unite, and if they did, it would be a "mishmash" and a "forced merger." They also said that my eldest sister claimed their faction was a genuine rebel faction, and they should correct their mistakes before they could unite.

From the information in their letters, both sides lacked the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences and strictly demanding of themselves. I wrote back to help my brothers and sisters-in-law study the "Three Articles" and Comrade Lin Biao's speech, thoroughly smashing the "self" in their minds. Indeed, soon they all wrote to tell me that they had further achieved "unity," and they no longer faced each other with such hostility.

Through the process of our family's "split" and "unity," it is evident that Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this unprecedented Cultural Revolution, truly touching the souls of hundreds of millions of revolutionary people. In an ordinary family, the phenomenon of only discussing trivial household matters has been thoroughly changed. Everyone is so concerned about national affairs and politics, using the great Mao Zedong Thought to arm their minds. This is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon.

    在我们家庭里
    五好战士　张有仲
    前些日子，我刚收到大姐的来信，就接二连三地收到大哥、二哥和二姐的来信。他们在信中，你说我站错了队，我说你站错了队，总之，都说自己对。
    大姐来信说：“在这次文化大革命中，家里形成了两派。我和你大姐夫，你二哥、二姐夫、大嫂是一派，你大哥、二嫂和你二姐是另一派。大家都说自己是坚定不移地站在以毛主席为首的无产阶级革命派一边的。”
    后来二哥来信也说：“现在咱家和社会上一样两大派分得特别明显，大哥二姐见到我们说话就辩论，中间好象隔着一堵墙。”
    根据家里的来信，我带着问题学习了毛主席的有关教导。我想他们之间虽然隔着一堵“墙”，但是在他们的来信中，却反映一个共同的愿望，都说要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席。他们主观上都是要积极参加文化大革命的。那么，他们中间的小资产阶级派性的“墙”，是一定能用无产阶级的党性和战无不胜的毛泽东思想的锐利武器彻底打通的。
    于是，我就积极地写信，用毛主席的教导去启发他们，要他们自觉地用“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的公式为指针，开展民主讨论，进行自我批评。同时帮助他们认清形势，对准目标，把千仇万恨都集中在党内最大的走资派身上，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    就在这时，我从广播里听到了毛主席发出的最新指示：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”我就写信要哥哥姐姐和嫂嫂学习最新指示。他们马上进行了学习讨论，表示对毛主席的指示，一千个拥护，一万个照办，坚决挖掉小资产阶级派性的“墙”。经过辩论，我们家的“两大派”，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，实现了革命的“大联合”。
    我家“联合”不久，大哥来信说，不知从哪里刮来了一股“拆台风”，说现在社会上的两大派决不能联合，如果联合也是“大杂烩”、“大捏合”。还说，大姐说他们那派是响当当的造反派，要大哥他们检查错误才能联合。
    从他们来信反映的情况看，两方面都缺乏求大同存小异，严格要求自己的精神。我又回信帮助哥嫂们学习“老三篇”和林副主席讲话，大破头脑中的“私”字。果然，不久他们都来信告诉我，他们进一步实现了“大联合”，见面不再那样对立了。
    通过我们一家“分裂”和“联合”的情况，很好地反映出毛主席亲自主持和发动这场史无前例的文化大革命，真正触动了亿万革命人民的灵魂。在一个普普通通的家庭里，彻底改变了那种只谈家务琐事的现象，大家都那么关心国家大事，关心政治，都用伟大的毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，这的确是十分可喜的现象。
