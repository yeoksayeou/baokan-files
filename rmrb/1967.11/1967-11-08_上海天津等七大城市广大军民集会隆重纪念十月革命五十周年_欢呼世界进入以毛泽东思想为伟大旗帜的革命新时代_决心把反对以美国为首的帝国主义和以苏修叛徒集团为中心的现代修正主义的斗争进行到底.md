Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Guangzhou—seven major cities—held grand gatherings to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. The broad masses of revolutionary people and the People's Liberation Army soldiers enthusiastically celebrated the entry of the world into a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. They resolved to carry on the struggle against imperialism, with the United States at its head, and modern revisionism, with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique at its center, to the very end.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated November 7, revolutionary masses and People's Liberation Army soldiers in Shanghai, Shenyang, Tianjin, Wuhan, Xi'an, Chengdu, and Guangzhou held grand gatherings to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution.

Revolutionary masses and soldiers from various places participated in the meetings with deep respect for Lenin, the great founder of the October Revolution, and his successor, Stalin. The broad masses of revolutionary people and soldiers enthusiastically celebrated the entry of the world into a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. They resolved to raise the great banner of the October Revolution even higher, to raise the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, to support the revolutionary struggles of the proletariat and the peoples of all countries more powerfully, and to join the revolutionary peoples of the world in carrying on the struggle against imperialism, with the United States at its head, and modern revisionism, with the Soviet revisionist traitor clique at its center, to the very end.

In the afternoon of November 7, revolutionary masses in Shanghai held a commemorative meeting at the Cultural Revolution Square, presided over by Liao Zhenguo, a responsible person from the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and the PLA units stationed in Shanghai. Wang Shaoyong, a leading member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, spoke at the meeting. He said, "From the October Revolution in the Soviet Union to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, it has been exactly half a century. In this half century, two great proletarian revolutions of epoch-making significance in world history have emerged. The first revolution provided experience for the proletariat on how to seize political power, while the second revolution provided experience for the proletariat on how to consolidate political power. In just half a century, the international communist movement has seen such two great leaps forward, which is a great victory for Marxism and a great joy for humanity." Wang Shaoyong said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has deeply and systematically summarized the historical experience of proletarian dictatorship in China and internationally, both the positive and negative experiences, especially the serious lessons of the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. He has comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, creatively proposed the great theory of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and personally initiated and led the first Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history. This is a very significant sign that Marxism has developed to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought." Wang Shaoyong said, "We must better follow our great leader Chairman Mao, follow the great Mao Zedong Thought, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, learn from the masses, and strive to become the vanguard that Chairman Mao expects, to make new contributions to thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

In Shenyang, a grand gathering and parade were held by the revolutionary masses and the PLA troops stationed there. Jiang Yonghui, a responsible person from the Shenyang Military Region, spoke at the military gathering, angrily denouncing the crimes of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in usurping the power of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist traitor clique, under the pretext of a "party of the whole people" and a "state of the whole people," has betrayed the October Revolution, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, betrayed socialism, and betrayed proletarian internationalism. Today, on the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, the world has entered a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, specially promote the absolute authority of our great leader Chairman Mao, specially promote the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought, specially promote the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, follow Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, firmly grasp the overall direction of the struggle, take "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the key link, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

In Tianjin, more than 2,000 revolutionary masses and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force stationed in Tianjin held a commemorative meeting in the afternoon of November 7. The meeting was presided over by Hu Zhaoheng, a responsible person from the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group. Shao Siming, a responsible person from the Tianjin Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the PLA units stationed in Tianjin, spoke at the meeting. He said, "Today, on the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, we will never forget the glorious path of the October Revolution opened by the glorious Bolshevik Party and the great Soviet proletariat. The traitors of the October Revolution, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and Kosygin, have trampled on the great banner of Leninism, betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, turned the Soviet Union into a revisionist state, and committed heinous crimes." He said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, completely and thoroughly solved the most important contemporary issue of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. This is a great development of Marxism-Leninism's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat." He said, "On the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, we must remember the serious lessons of the full restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, carry forward the spirit of thorough proletarian revolution, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end."

In the afternoon of November 7, the PLA Wuhan Military Region troops and revolutionary masses in the Wuhan area held a gathering. Responsible persons from the Wuhan Military Region, such as Zeng Siyu and Liu Feng, attended the meeting. Comrade Liu Feng, in his speech, enthusiastically praised the great significance of the great October Socialist Revolution and the first Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in human history. He stressed that now the world has entered a new revolutionary era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest proletarian revolutionary theory guiding the revolutionary movements in our country and the world.

On the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we must resolutely respond to Vice Chairman Lin's great call, more consciously specially promote the absolute authority of the great commander Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, and make the effort to learn, resolutely implement, actively propagate, and bravely defend Mao Zedong Thought our lifelong battle task. He said, "We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, seriously study and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions, follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, take 'struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism' as the key link, and strive for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution."

In Xi'an, more than 5,000 revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers held a grand gathering on November 7. Hu Wei, a responsible person from the PLA units stationed in Shaanxi, spoke at the meeting, saying, "On the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, we must remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: 'The broad masses of the people, the broad masses of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long.' We firmly believe that the true communists of the Soviet Union, nurtured by the great Lenin and Stalin, with the glorious tradition of the October Revolution, tempered and tested by the Patriotic War, and the great Soviet people will definitely draw new strength from the great Mao Zedong Thought and the great practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, re-raise the banner of the October Revolution, and make the red star of the October Revolution shine more brilliantly. The traitors Khrushchev and his successors Brezhnev and Kosygin will definitely not escape the punishment of history. The future world will definitely be a new world of communism under the radiance of Mao Zedong Thought!"

In Chengdu, more than 3,500 revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers stationed in Chengdu held a grand commemorative meeting in the evening of November 6. Zhang Guohua, the group leader of the Sichuan Provincial Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the first political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region, spoke at the meeting, pointing out: "The Soviet revisionist traitor clique has completely betrayed Marxism-Leninism, completely betrayed the path of the October Revolution, committed heinous crimes against the Soviet people and the revolutionary peoples of the world, and is the most vicious enemy of the Soviet people and a common enemy of the revolutionary peoples of the world." He said, "On the occasion of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, we are glad to see that the great Mao Zedong Thought is guiding the revolutionary peoples of the world with the revolutionary spirit of 'seizing the day,' cleansing the muddy waters of Khrushchev revisionism, and striving to create a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without the system of exploitation! We must raise the great banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought even higher, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and build Sichuan into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought."

In the morning of November 7, various revolutionary masses in Guangzhou held a grand gathering. Kong Shiquan, a responsible person from the Guangzhou Military Region, spoke at the meeting, saying, "The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao is a great innovation in the international communist movement and a great development of Marxism-Leninism. The Soviet modern revisionists are in a state of panic in the face of the surging tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, fearing that the influence of Mao Zedong Thought will awaken the Soviet people to rise up in revolution and overthrow their rule. We believe that the Soviet proletariat and laboring people with a glorious revolutionary tradition will definitely rise up under the banner of Leninism to overthrow the rule of the revisionist reactionary clique and bring the Soviet Union back onto the socialist track."

    在纪念伟大十月社会主义革命五十周年的时候，我们要坚决响应林副主席的伟大号召，更加自觉地大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把努力学习、坚决贯彻、积极宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，作为毕生的战斗任务。他说，我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真学习和坚决贯彻毛主席的最新指示，紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，以“斗私，批修”为纲，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利而奋斗。

    广州市各界革命群众七日上午隆重集会。广州部队负责人孔石泉在大会上讲话说，毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举，是毛主席对马克思列宁主义的划时代的新发展。苏联现代修正主义者在我国无产阶级文化大革命的洪流冲击下，惶惶不可终日，他们害怕毛泽东思想的影响会促进苏联人民的觉醒，起来造他们的反，革他们的命。我们相信，具有光荣革命传统的苏联无产阶级和劳动人民，一定会在列宁主义的旗帜下起来革命，推翻修正主义反动集团的统治，使苏联重新回到社会主义的轨道上来。
