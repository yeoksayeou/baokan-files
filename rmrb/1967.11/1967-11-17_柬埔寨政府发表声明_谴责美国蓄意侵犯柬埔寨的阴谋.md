Cambodian Government Issues Statement Denouncing U.S. Plot to Invade Cambodia

	Newspaper Source: Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, November 14

	According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on November 11, the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement denouncing the U.S. plot to invade Cambodia.

	The statement cited a report from the November 6 edition of the New York Times, which openly stated, "The United States cannot guarantee that U.S. or (South) Vietnamese troops will not invade Cambodian territory during combat."

	The statement said: "The Royal Government of Cambodia strongly condemns the U.S. for its despicable actions, as the U.S. has openly admitted to supporting the expansionist policies of the puppet regimes in Saigon and Bangkok."

	The statement pointed out: "The Royal Government has noted that the U.S. is attempting to justify future aggression against Cambodia and the invasion of Cambodian territory."

	The statement said: "The U.S. has exposed its plans to expand the war of aggression beyond the borders of Vietnam. Therefore, all justice-loving countries must recognize that Washington's policy is increasingly adopting fascist methods, which official propaganda desperately tries to conceal."

	The statement concluded: "As for Cambodian-U.S. relations, the past few years have proven that the severance of diplomatic ties has only benefited Cambodia."

	According to a report by the Xinhua News Agency in Phnom Penh on November 13, the Cambodian News Agency reported on November 11 that the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a communiqué stating that on the afternoon of October 29, a force of approximately 200 invaders from Thailand, armed with mortars and automatic weapons, attacked the military outpost of Tado in the province of Oddar Meanchey. Among these Thai and "Free Khmer" invaders, there were three to four Westerners. Three Cambodian soldiers were killed, and four were wounded. Two women and five children from the families of Cambodian soldiers were also seriously injured.

	The communiqué condemned this particularly serious new act of aggression. The communiqué pointed out: "The forces used in the attack on Tado indicate that this is actually an escalation of the war against Cambodia."

	The communiqué said: "The Royal Government finally emphasizes to international public opinion that Westerners—clearly members of the U.S. special forces—participated in the attack on Cambodia from the Thai front, which is the first time this has happened. This also confirms our intelligence: the U.S. imperialists play a crucial role in organizing, training, and forming units of the traitorous 'Free Khmer' elements stationed in Thailand. U.S. armed forces directly participated in the attack on the Tado outpost."

	According to another report by the Cambodian News Agency on November 7, six to seven weeks ago, the U.S. military command in Pleiku, South Vietnam, used helicopters to air-drop small groups of spies into the Ratanakiri region of Cambodia, possibly in preparation for infiltrating certain areas of this province.

    柬埔寨政府发表声明
    谴责美国蓄意侵犯柬埔寨的阴谋
    新华社金边十四日电  据柬埔寨新闻社十一日报道，柬埔寨王国政府发表声明，谴责美国蓄意侵犯柬埔寨的卑鄙阴谋。
    声明引用十一月六日《纽约时报》的报道，这个报道公然表示，“美国不可能保证美国或（南）越军队在战斗中不侵犯柬埔寨边境。”
    声明说：“柬埔寨王国政府愤怒地谴责美国的卑鄙行径，美国已经公开供认它支持西贡和曼谷傀儡政权的扩张主义政策。”
    声明指出：“王国政府注意到，美国就是这样企图来为将来侵略柬埔寨和入侵柬埔寨领土辩解。”
    声明说：“美国已经暴露了它把侵略战争扩大到越南边境之外的计划。因此，所有伸张正义的国家必须认识到，华盛顿的政策日益采取法西斯的手段，而官方宣传拚命加以掩饰。”
    声明最后说：“至于柬美关系，前几年的经过已经证明，柬美断交，结果对柬埔寨只有好处。”
    据新华社金边十三日电　据柬埔寨新闻社十一日报道，柬埔寨王国政府发表公报说，十月二十九日下午，来自泰国的一支由约二百人组成的入侵部队，用迫击炮和自动武器袭击了奥多棉藏省的塔多军事哨所，在这批泰国和“自由高棉”的入侵者中，有三至四个西方人。柬埔寨哨所的守军有三人被打死，四人被打伤。柬埔寨军人家属中有两个妇女和五个儿童也受了重伤。
    公报谴责这一性质特别严重的新的罪恶侵略。公报指出：“对塔多进行袭击所投入的兵力表明，事实上这是针对柬埔寨的战争行动的升级。”
    公报说：“王国政府最后要着重提请国际舆论注意，西方人——很明显是美国特种部队的人员，在泰国前线参加了对柬埔寨的进攻，这还是第一次。这也证实了我们所掌握的情报：美帝在把驻扎在泰国的叛徒‘自由高棉分子’加以组织、训练、编成队伍方面，起了头等重要的作用。美国武装部队直接参与了对塔多哨所的袭击。”
    另据柬埔寨新闻社十一月七日报道，在六、七个星期以前，美国在南越波来古的军事指挥部用直升飞机向柬埔寨腊塔纳基里地区空投了一些小股特务，可能是为侵入柬埔寨这个省份的某些地区作准备。
