Our Beijing Watch Factory, under the control of the old Beijing Municipal Committee's revisionist line, had a bloated organization and a large cadre team. The entire factory had only about five hundred people, but there were over eighty administrative and technical cadres.

In January of this year, two-thirds of the cadres in the entire factory went down to the production teams in various workshops to strengthen the front line. After more than ten months of practice, it has been proven that cadres going among the people is of great significance in promoting the revolution and production, promoting the thought revolution of cadres, and improving cadre-mass relations.

Our former technical director, Zhang Shiquan, was promoted from a worker. In the past, he thought, "I am of worker origin, and I am not afraid of technical difficulties," so he often sat in the office and rarely went to the workshop to work. Over time, he gradually became detached from the people, and his officialdom grew stronger, becoming more and more out of touch with his class brothers. Sometimes, when he occasionally went to the workshop, the workers would sharply criticize him, saying, "The technical master is here to supervise again!" At the beginning of this year, he went to the stamping team to work with the workers, and his relationship with the people gradually improved. He also learned a lot from the people. For example, once he was doing the work of stamping the edge holes of a watch case. After stamping, he couldn't take out the material no matter how hard he tried. He was so anxious that he had no choice but to use an iron sheet to pry it out, but he didn't get much done in half a day. At this time, a worker beside him enthusiastically told him, "The harder you pull, the tighter it sticks. You have to pull it out gently." Zhang Shiquan deeply felt that Chairman Mao taught us, "In a certain sense, the smartest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience." It is indeed true.

Qiu Yucui, who used to be the workshop director, and Deputy Director Yan Jiqing, one was promoted from a worker to a cadre and gradually became detached from the people; the other made mistakes in executing the bourgeois reactionary line. The people were angry with both of them. When they first went down to work, the people posted big slogans on Yan Jiqing's workbench to criticize him. At that time, both of them had the thought of fearing to be criticized and had resistance. However, through working together with everyone to promote the revolution and production, under the sincere criticism and enthusiastic help of the people, they gradually realized that in the past they went against Chairman Mao's teachings, became detached from the people, and stood on the wrong side. The people's criticism of us is to help us return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, which is a true concern and care for us. In the future, they are determined to maintain close contact with the people and always be one with the people.

The former Party branch committee member and deputy director of the factory, Hu Yuetan, is a cadre transferred from the army. In his few years of work in the factory, he also made some mistakes. Hu Yuetan worked with the people and listened seriously to the people's criticism, seriously examined his own mistakes, and gained the trust and support of the broad masses. He was appointed as the deputy director of the factory revolutionary committee. Some technical cadres who had just graduated from school found many of their weaknesses after going down to the workshop, learned a lot of good things from the workers, and their thoughts and feelings changed. They began to move their standpoint to the side of the working class. After the cadres participated in labor, through labor tempering, the relations between cadres and the masses became closer, and the idea of being an official and a lord was discarded. They established the idea of being a humble student and a lifelong servant of the people.

    干部到群众里面去就是好
    我们北京钟表厂，过去在旧北京市委修正主义路线的统治下，机构臃肿，干部队伍庞大。全厂一共只有五百人左右，行政干部和技术干部就有八十多名。
    今年一月份，全厂三分之二的干部下到各车间的生产小组去充实第一线。经过十个月多的实践证明：干部到群众中去，对抓革命促生产，对促进干部思想革命化，改善干群关系，有着极其重大的作用。
    我们厂原技术科长张世全，是从工人提拔起来的。过去他以为“我是工人出身，技术上难不住我”，因此，常坐办公室，很少下车间劳动。久而久之，逐渐地脱离了群众，身上“官”气越来越足，和阶级兄弟的感情越来越格格不入。有时他偶尔到车间一次，工人同志便尖锐地批评说：“技术老爷又来监督了！”今年年初，他到冲压小组和工人一起劳动，和群众的关系才逐渐地密切了，并向群众学到了许多东西。如有一次，他干表套冲边孔的活，冲完后，怎么也拿不出料来，急得没法，只得用铁片往外撬，半天没干出多少活来。这时，在一旁的工人同志热情地告诉他：“你越用力，它越贴得紧。要轻轻地拿，才拿得下来。”张世全深有感触地说，毛主席教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”真是千真万确。
    当过车间主任的仇玉清和副主任阎家庆，一个是从工人提拔为干部以后，逐渐脱离了群众；一个是犯了执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。群众对他们两个都有气。在刚下去劳动时，群众还在阎家庆的工作台上贴大标语批评他。当时，他们俩都有怕挨整的思想和抵触情绪。但是通过和大家在一起抓革命促生产，在群众诚恳的批评和热情的帮助下，他们逐步认识到：过去违背了毛主席的教导，脱离了群众，站错了队，群众批评我们，就是要帮助我们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，是对自己真正的关怀和爱护。今后决心密切同群众的联系，永远同群众打成一片。
    原厂党支部委员、副厂长胡月潭是从部队转业的干部。在厂里的几年工作中，也犯过一些错误。胡月潭在劳动中和群众打成一片，认真听取群众的批评，认真检查自己的错误，得到了广大群众的信任和拥护，担任了厂革委会副主任。一些刚出校门不久的技术干部，在下车间劳动后，发现了自己身上的许多弱点，从工人那里学到了许多好的东西，思想感情发生了变化，开始把立足点移到工人阶级一边来。干部参加劳动后，通过劳动锻炼，干群关系密切了，丢掉了做官当老爷的思想，树立了甘当小学生，永做人民勤务员的思想。
