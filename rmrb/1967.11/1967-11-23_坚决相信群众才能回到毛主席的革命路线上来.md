Editor's Note: During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some cadres once executed the bourgeois reactionary line. How should these cadres quickly correct their mistakes and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line? Comrade Yu Jialin answers this question with his personal experience. That is to firmly follow Chairman Mao's teachings, believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and correctly handle the relationship with the masses and the mass movement.

Great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Many people do not handle the relationship between officers and soldiers, between the army and the people well, thinking it is a matter of method. I always tell them it is a matter of fundamental attitude (or fundamental purpose). This attitude is to respect soldiers and respect the people."

The main reason why some cadres make mistakes is that they deviate from Chairman Mao's teachings in their fundamental attitude towards the masses. They often stand on the bourgeois standpoint and adopt the attitude of a feudal lord towards the masses. Thus, they drift further and further away from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Cadres who have made mistakes must undergo a fundamental change in their worldview, shifting their standpoint to the side of the revolutionary masses, in order to gain the trust and support of the masses and better accomplish the tasks assigned by the Party.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I committed a directional and line error. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, I gradually recognized my mistakes and resolved to thoroughly correct them.

From actively executing the bourgeois reactionary line to completely breaking with this reactionary line and returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, this was the result of a struggle between two lines and two worldviews on the issue of stance and attitude towards the masses.

At the beginning of accepting the masses' criticism, I had some misunderstandings about certain issues and harbored "five kinds of air": I thought the masses' criticism of my mistakes was "excessive," feeling wronged; I thought those who rose up to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line were "troublemakers" and "disobedient" in the past, and I was not convinced; I thought I was still a decent cadre in the past, "indestructible," so on one hand, I had some arrogance; on the other hand, when I heard people shouting "down with," I also felt disheartened; I thought "if I didn't change jobs, it would be fine," and I had some grievances. These "five kinds of air" essentially revealed my doubts and lack of trust in this great revolutionary mass movement and the revolutionary masses. This attitude hindered me from standing with the masses to jointly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line.

I brought these active thoughts and seriously studied Chairman Mao's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," learning Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles regarding the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. I focused on solving the issues of stance and attitude towards the mass movement and the masses.

Chairman Mao pointed out that during the revolutionary period, it is necessary to establish the "absolute power" of the revolutionary masses, and the revolutionary masses must have an overwhelming heroic spirit. Chairman Mao also taught us: "Revolution is an uprising, an act of violence by one class to overthrow another." If the proletarian revolutionary faction does not have "absolute power," does not have an overwhelming spirit, and does not take "violent action," it will not be possible to wage a great struggle and battle against the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guizhou, to expose these harmful elements, or to overthrow them. I executed the bourgeois reactionary line and made mistakes, actually playing a role in helping the enemy; while criticizing my mistakes in executing the reactionary line is necessary to defend Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and ensure that the Party and the country do not change color. What is there to complain about or even feel disheartened?

Using Chairman Mao's historical materialist viewpoint and class analysis method to compare, I found that my view of the proletarian revolutionary faction was the same as the view of the gentry towards the peasants during the democratic revolution. Those who were called "disobedient" were mostly those who resisted slavery during the period of the reactionary line's rule, dared to speak out, dared to insist on the truth, and were revolutionary. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stood at the forefront of the struggle, exposed a small handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, and dug out a large number of evil facts of their attempted counter-revolutionary restoration, pulling them down from their horses. Their stance was firm, their banner was clear, and they were fearless. While I stood on the opposite side, becoming an obstacle to the revolution. What reason was there to be unconvinced? Even if I was "not bad in the past," my current mistakes are serious. If I still have arrogance, I will cut myself off from the revolutionary masses. Through studying Chairman Mao's teachings and the living facts of education, I felt more and more that I had wronged Chairman Mao and the revolutionary masses. Thinking of the past suppression and persecution of the proletarian revolutionary faction, I felt pain in my heart, which greatly aroused my class feelings and increased my awareness of self-examination to revolutionary comrades.

As the revolutionary criticism deepened, it was not enough to just admit the facts of the mistakes; one must examine the mistakes in terms of "line" and "principle"; one must deeply touch the soul and uproot the problem. At this time, "grievances" arose again, always emphasizing objective reasons and not finding the cause in oneself. Things like "not understanding the movement," "good intentions," "whoever leads the movement will make mistakes," and so on. At this time, the revolutionary masses pointed out to me: "You do not examine the essence of the mistake, do not touch the soul, you do not want to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

"The Three Articles" are sharp weapons for transforming one's worldview. Chairman Mao teaches: "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, it is thoroughly for the people's interests." Chairman Mao's teachings are about being completely and thoroughly for the people's "public" interests. Following Chairman Mao's teachings, I examined each mistake I made in various stages of the movement, finding the cause in the depths of my soul. I realized that my soul is a "public-private joint venture," with the bourgeois individualism of fame, wealth, power, and position—the "private" character playing the leading role. To benefit oneself necessarily harms others, and thus one must make mistakes. It is this "private" character that made me unknowingly and comfortably become a political "prisoner" of a small handful of capitalist-roaders within the Guizhou Party, pushing me to the forefront of the reactionary line. It is this "private" character that made me deviate from Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the revolutionary masses during the movement. I deeply realized: "private" is the soil that produces and nurtures revisionism, it is the decisive factor in my making mistakes. If I do not overthrow the "private" character, no matter when or where, in executing any task, I will make mistakes. The "grievances" in one's thoughts are a product of the "private" character, it is the "germ" that makes one continue to execute the wrong line.

How to overcome the "private" character? Is it to "open the door for rectification" or to "close the door for self-reflection"? This again sparked a fierce struggle in my thoughts. At this time, I also knew that following the method of "self-cultivation" to secretly "rectify" is not a revolutionary attitude and method. However, I was also afraid, not daring to reveal my thoughts, fearing exposure, fearing ridicule, fearing the loss of reputation, fearing to be criticized... Essentially, I was afraid of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches: "As long as we persist in what is good for the people's interests and correct what is wrong for the people's interests, our army will definitely prosper." A revolutionary cadre who has made a mistake should have the courage to admit the mistake, reveal one's ugly thoughts, and stand with the revolutionary masses for criticism. Only in this way can one obtain better help and supervision from the masses, correct one's mistakes more quickly, and enable more comrades to learn from one's mistakes, which is beneficial to the people. Practice has proven that by doing so, one gains the welcome and encouragement of the masses, bringing oneself closer to the masses, thus increasing the courage to reveal one's thoughts and touch the soul to the revolutionary masses. To remove the "fear" and replace it with "dare," one must overcome the "private" character and establish the "public" character. "The Three Articles" are the special medicine for treating the "private" character disease, they are the foundation for establishing the "public" character, and one must constantly and purposefully work hard to study them. Study a little, compare a little, apply a little, fulfill a little, definitely fall on overcoming the "private" character and establishing the "public" character, transforming one's worldview, and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in one's mind. Only by doing these can one become a thorough materialist, believe in the masses, reveal one's true thoughts to the masses, and gain the trust of the masses.

Chairman Mao teaches: "We Communist Party members should face the storm and rain, see the world; this storm and rain is the great storm and rain of the masses' struggle, this world is the great world of the masses' struggle." Following this teaching, I regarded the scene of the masses' struggle as the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and the revolutionary masses as good teachers and friends, going among them to accept great criticism and great examination. The revolutionary masses are the most able to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, their love and hate are the clearest, and they are the most reasonable. Once among the masses, one obtains the help and courage to correct mistakes. They not only can criticize my mistakes in an uncompromising and sharp manner but also can conduct in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, using living facts to arouse my class feelings and hatred towards the bourgeois reactionary line; using the one-divides-into-two viewpoint to timely affirm and encourage my every progress, and propose requirements and hopes, providing me with the conditions to expose and face-to-face struggle with a small handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and so on. These have all played a positive role in my correcting mistakes.

The masses' change from not believing to trusting and forgiving me is a gradual change as my attitude towards Chairman Mao and the masses gradually becomes correct. Over the past year, I have felt that after making a mistake, one must go to the masses, through the masses' criticism and help, to obtain a correct, thorough, and relatively quick correction; whether the mistake is corrected or not? How well is it corrected? Only the masses have the right to be the judge. Going to the masses, one must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "putting down one's arrogance and becoming a small student." In practice, I have felt that one should do the following four points: (1) With a self-aware and honest attitude, admit mistakes to the masses, examine mistakes, and jointly criticize one's mistakes with the masses. Especially, one must strengthen the self-awareness of overcoming the "private" character and touching the soul. To the masses, one must speak from the heart, firmly with the broad revolutionary masses to expose and criticize the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Guizhou, the responsibility must not be pushed down, avoiding causing the masses to fight among themselves; (2) With an active and proactive attitude, approach the proletarian revolutionary faction, firmly stand on their side, strive for small-scale discussions and individual heart-to-heart talks, which are good for mutual understanding and accepting education; (3) With proletarian revolutionary feelings and attitude, treat the masses' criticism. Whatever is beneficial to returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, no matter the attitude, as long as the facts are not greatly different, one must firmly accept it; for whatever is harmful to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, one must firmly uphold the truth and correct mistakes; (4) With a humble and active attitude, treat the masses' encouragement. When the masses have forgiveness and encouragement for you, one must not be complacent, but should seize the opportunity of harmonious feelings to talk about the lessons of making mistakes and the harmfulness of the "private" character, both educating oneself and warning revolutionary comrades.

"We should believe in the masses, we should believe in the Party, these are two fundamental principles." I am following Chairman Mao's teaching to return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. In the future, I will definitely study "The Three Articles" hard, further overcome the "private" character, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in my thoughts, work for the revolution for life, and create new achievements for the people and the revolution.

### 坚决相信群众才能回到毛主席的革命路线上来

    坚决相信群众才能回到毛主席的革命路线上来
    贵州省文化办公室核心领导小组成员、原贵阳市委宣传部长
                  　于佳临
    编者按：在无产阶级文化大革命中，有些干部曾经执行过资产阶级反动路线。这些干部，应当怎样迅速改正错误，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来呢？于佳临同志用他的切身体会，回答了这个问题。这就是要坚决遵照毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，正确地对待群众，对待群众运动。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“很多人对于官兵关系、军民关系弄不好，以为是方法不对，我总告诉他们是根本态度（或根本宗旨）问题，这态度就是尊重士兵和尊重人民。”
    我们有些干部所以会犯这样那样的错误，主要原因是在对待群众的根本态度上，违背了毛主席的教导。他们往往站在资产阶级的立场上，用资产阶级的老爷态度对待群众。这样，就离开毛主席的革命路线越来越远。
    犯错误的干部只有在世界观上来个根本的转变，把立足点移到革命群众这边来，才能取得群众的信任，得到群众的支持，更好地完成党交给自己的任务。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我犯了方向路线错误。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我逐步认识到自己所犯的错误，决心彻底改正错误。
    我从积极地执行资产阶级反动路线到与这条反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，是在对待群众的立场和态度问题上的两种思想、两种世界观斗争的结果。
    在开始接受群众批判时，我对某些问题想不通，产生了“五气”：认为群众批判我的错误的行动“过火”，有股子“冤气”；认为起来大造资产阶级反动路线的反的，是过去“调皮”和“不听话”的人，对他们
  “不服气”；认为自己过去还是个不坏的干部，是“打不倒”的，因此，一方面有些“傲气”；另一方面，当听到都在喊“打倒”时，又有些“泄气”；认为“不转业就好了”，又有“怨气”。这“五气”，实质上表露了我对这场伟大的革命群众运动和对革命群众的怀疑和不信任的态度。这种态度阻碍了我和群众站在一起共同批判资产阶级反动路线。
    我带上这些活思想重新认真学习毛主席的《湖南农民运动考察报告》，学习毛主席关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，重点解决对待群众运动和对待群众的立场和态度问题。
    毛主席指出，在革命时期必须建立革命群众的
  “绝对权力”，革命群众必须有压倒一切的英雄气概。毛主席还教导我们：“革命是暴动，是一个阶级推翻一个阶级的暴烈的行动。”如果无产阶级革命派没有“绝对权力”，没有压倒一切的气魄，不采取“暴烈的行动”，就不可能向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在贵州的代理人进行一场大搏斗、大厮杀，就不可能把这伙害人虫揪出来，也不可能把他们打倒。我执行了资产阶级反动路线，犯了错误，实际上起了帮助敌人的作用；而批判我执行反动路线的错误，是为了捍卫毛泽东思想，捍卫毛主席的革命路线，确保党和国家不变颜色所必需的。这有什么可以喊冤叫屈、甚至“泄气”的理由呢？
    用毛主席的历史唯物主义的观点和阶级分析的方法来对照，我发觉我对无产阶级革命派的看法，就同民主革命时期绅士们对农民的看法一样。所谓“不听话”的人，大部分就是在反动路线统治时期抵制奴隶主义，敢于提意见、敢于坚持真理、富有革命性的人。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，站在斗争的最前线，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派揪出来了，挖出了他们妄图进行反革命复辟的大量罪恶事实，把他们拉下了马。他们立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，无所畏惧。而我却站在他们的对立面，成了革命的绊脚石。有什么理由“不服气”呢？就算我“过去不坏”，但现在错误是严重的，再有“傲气”，就是自绝于革命群众了。通过学习毛主席的教导和活生生的事实教育，我越想越感到对不起毛主席，越想越感到对不起革命群众。想到过去对无产阶级革命派的打击、迫害，内心感到痛苦，大大激发了我的阶级感情，提高了向革命同志检查的自觉性。
    随着革命大批判的深入，只是承认错误事实是不行的，必须把错误提到“纲”上、“线”上检查；必须深触灵魂挖根子。这时又产生了“怨气”，总是强调客观原因，不从主观上去找原因。什么“对运动不理解”，“动机是好的”，“这个运动谁来搞也要犯错误”，等等。这时，革命群众又向我指出：“你不检查错误实质，不触及灵魂，是不愿回到毛主席的革命路线上来。”
    “老三篇”是改造人的世界观的锐利的思想武器。毛主席教导说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”毛主席教导的就是一个完全、彻底为人民的“公”字。我遵照毛主席的这一教导，针对我在运动中各个阶段所犯的错误，逐个问题地从灵魂深处找原因，认识到我的灵魂是“公私合营”的，名、利、权、位的资产阶级个人主义——“私”字却起了主导作用。既要利己，必定损人，就必然要犯错误。就是这个“私”字，才使我不知不觉地、舒舒服服地当了贵州省党内一小撮走资派的政治“俘虏”，被他们推上了反动路线的第一线。就是这个“私”字，在运动中使我背离了毛主席的革命路线，背离了革命群众。我深刻地认识到：“私”字是产生和滋长修正主义的土壤，是我犯错误的决定因素。如果不斗倒“私”字，不管在何时何地，在执行任何任务中都是会犯错误的。思想上的“怨气”是“私”字的派生物，它是使自己继续执行错误路线的“病菌”。
    如何破私？是“开门整风”，还是“闭门思过”？这又引起了思想上的激烈斗争。这时也知道按照《修养》“闭门思过”的办法，偷偷“改”，不是革命的态度和办法。但是，又“怕”字当头，不敢亮思想，怕丑，怕别人讥笑，怕毁了名誉，怕上纲上线加重错误……。实质就是怕群众。
    毛主席教导说：“只要我们为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的，我们这个队伍就一定会兴旺起来。”一个革命干部犯了错误，应该有勇气承认错误，把自己的丑恶思想亮出来，同革命群众站在一起进行批判。只有这样，才能得到群众更好的帮助和监督，使自己更好更快地改正错误，并能使更多的同志从自己的错误中吸取教训，这是对人民有利的。实践证明，这样一做，就得到了群众的欢迎和鼓励，使我和群众靠拢了一步，从而增强了敢于向革命群众亮思想、触灵魂的勇气。去掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，必须破“私”立“公”。“老三篇”是防治“私”字病的特效药，是立“公”字的基石，必须经常不断地、有的放矢地下苦功夫学。学习一点、对照一点、运用一点、兑现一点，一定要落到破私立公、改造世界观上，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。只有做到这些，才能成为一个彻底的唯物主义者，才能相信群众，向群众交真心、亮思想，才能取得群众的信任。
    毛主席教导说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”我遵照这一教导，把群众斗争的场所，当做毛泽东思想的大学校，把革命的群众做为良师益友，到他们中去接受大批判、大检验。革命群众是最能按毛主席的指示办事的，爱憎最分明，最通情达理。一到群众中去，就得到改正错误的帮助和勇气。他们不仅能对我的错误进行毫不含糊的、尖锐的揭发批判，并能进行深入细致的思想政治工作，用活生生的事实，激发我的阶级感情和对资产阶级反动路线的仇恨；用一分为二的观点及时肯定勉励我的每一个进步，并提出要求和希望，为我提供揭发和面对面斗争党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的条件，等等。这些，对我改正错误都起了积极的作用。
    群众对我由不相信到信任谅解，是随着我对毛主席和对群众的态度逐步端正，而逐步变化的。一年来，我体会到犯了错误，只有到群众中去，通过群众的批判帮助，才能得到正确的、彻底的、较快的改正；错误改正与否？改正得好不好？只有群众才最有资格当这个评判员。到群众中去，必须按照毛主席关于“放下臭架子、甘当小学生”的教导，我在实践中体会到应该做到四点：（1）以自觉老实的态度，向群众承认错误，检查错误，与群众一道批判自己的错误。特别要加强斗私、触及灵魂的自觉性。对群众要讲真心话，要坚决地同广大革命群众一道揭发、批判中国赫鲁晓夫及其在贵州代理人的罪恶，责任绝不能往下推，避免引起群众斗群众；（2）以积极主动的态度，向无产阶级革命派靠拢，坚定地站在他们一边，争取小型座谈、个别谈心，对互相了解、接受教育效果较好；（3）以无产阶级的革命感情和革命的态度，对待群众的批评。凡是有利于回到毛主席的革命路线上来的批评，不管态度如何，只要事实无大出入，要坚决接受；对有害于毛主席革命路线的言行，要旗帜鲜明地坚持真理、修正错误；（4）以谦虚、积极的态度对待群众的鼓励。当群众对你有了谅解鼓励的时候，绝不能飘飘然，应该抓住感情融洽的良好时机，大讲犯错误的教训，大谈“私”字危害性的切身体会，既能教育自己，又能告诫革命同志。
    “我们应当相信群众，我们应当相信党，这是两条根本的原理。”我就是遵照毛主席的这一教导回到毛主席革命路线上来的。我今后一定努力学习“老三篇”，进一步狠斗“私”字，在思想上树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，干一辈子革命，为人民、为革命立新功。
