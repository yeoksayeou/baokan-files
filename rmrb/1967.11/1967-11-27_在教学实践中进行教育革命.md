Classes resume to carry out the revolution. This is the policy of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, and it is the main direction of the struggle in schools at present. Only by resuming classes to carry out the revolution can we combine the actual situation of our school, conduct a better revolutionary criticism and reform of our school, carry out the proletarian educational revolution, and create a brand-new proletarian educational system.

Taking the struggle against selfishness and revisionism as the guiding principle, we strengthen ideological education.

Resuming classes to carry out the revolution is a political and ideological struggle. It will inevitably provoke a series of reactions within and outside the school. How can we make revolutionary teachers and students recognize the great significance of resuming classes to carry out the revolution and actively participate in this struggle? Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the key link in uniting the whole Party to wage great political struggles." The revolutionary teachers and students of our school firmly grasp the principle of "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism," taking "The Three Constantly Read Articles" as their motto. They fiercely struggle against selfish thoughts, constantly correct their understanding of the significance of resuming classes to carry out the revolution, and constantly enhance their sense of responsibility and initiative in resuming classes to carry out the revolution.

After resuming classes to carry out the revolution, some students thought that resuming classes meant returning to the old ways, which was boring, and that "not going out to charge does not look like a revolutionary." Graduating students said, "We have no task to resume classes to carry out the revolution." Many teachers, having suffered to varying degrees from the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line, did not want to teach again. Some teachers were afraid of making mistakes and being criticized. We organized revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's works with their problems in mind. We frequently held large, medium, and small study sessions on applying Chairman Mao's works, and specially organized Mao Zedong Thought study classes. Revolutionary cadres, revolutionary teachers, student cadres, Red Guards, and PLA comrades studied together in the classes, learning "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and the spirit of Year Four Wang's fierce struggle against the "private" thought. They exposed their selfish thoughts, discussed their harmful effects, dug out their roots, clarified their directions, and greatly enhanced the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of teachers and students. Some students who participated in the study classes linked the problems in resuming classes to carry out the revolution with their own thoughts and actively criticized their wrong attitudes towards teachers, expressing their determination to correct them. Many teachers conducted profound self-criticism on their thoughts of resentment and fear. Through study, many teachers got rid of their fears, strengthened their confidence, and realized that the educational revolution could not wait for higher authorities to provide methods or rely solely on others' experiences. Instead, they should follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "If you want to know the taste of a pear, you have to change the pear and taste it yourself." They went to practice, teaching while reforming.

Breaking first, daring to revolutionize.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without breaking, there can be no establishing. Breaking is criticism, is revolution. Breaking must be done with reason, and establishing is within breaking."

The revolutionary teachers and students of our school held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, deeply exposing and criticizing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in his frenzied opposition and resistance to Chairman Mao's educational line. Through extensive exposure and criticism, the revolutionary teachers and students were filled with intense class hatred, their political awareness was heightened, their ability to discern was enhanced, and the ideological foundation was laid for the subsequent resumption of classes to carry out the revolution and the reform of our unit.

On the basis of criticism, we focused on the following aspects of work:

First, we strongly advocated the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. In resuming classes to carry out the revolution, our school placed the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than anything else. In addition to insisting on "daily reading," we also opened courses on Mao Zedong Thought education. The purpose of opening this course is to enable teachers and students to frequently and purposefully study and master Mao Zedong Thought, promote the ideological transformation of people, and more effectively carry out the educational revolution.

Second, we emphasized politics and cultivated successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." He also requires us to "focus on learning, while also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticizing the bourgeoisie."

Based on Chairman Mao's educational policy and the five conditions for successors to the revolutionary cause, we clearly pointed out that the students we cultivate must be infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, gradually establish a proletarian worldview, cultivate feelings for workers and peasants, love manual labor, and stand firmly on the proletarian position in the great storms of class struggle; they must master the basic knowledge of culture and science, be able to directly participate in general industrial and agricultural production labor, and truly become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture. To achieve this goal, we made class struggle a main course. At present, it is to give a good lesson on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, continue to criticize the revisionist educational line, and carry out the proletarian educational revolution. At the same time, we also linked up with factories and rural areas, letting students learn industry and agriculture. For learning industry, half a day of production labor is arranged each week; for learning agriculture, students are prepared to participate in agricultural production labor during the busy season.

Third, under the absolute leadership of the Party, the proletarian revolutionary faction should take power and use it well.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." For seventeen years, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party have usurped the leadership of education, and bourgeois intellectuals have long ruled our schools. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction of our school seized power from them and established a revolutionary committee. We reformed the leadership system, smashed the past organizational structure centered on teaching, and set up a political department, teaching department, and general affairs department under the school revolutionary committee, absorbing revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers to participate; revolutionary committees and platoon committees were established in each grade, and political workers were appointed in grades and platoons (temporarily appointed part-time); teaching and research groups were abolished, teachers were assigned to fixed grades, and they studied politics with students, participated in labor and military-political training together.

Fourth, we reformed the teaching policy, content, and methods.

In resuming classes to carry out the revolution, we simplified the course settings, reduced some courses, and merged some courses. At the same time, we added courses on industrial and agricultural production knowledge and military sports. Political, language, and history courses use Chairman Mao's works as the basic textbooks, and science courses are currently simplified. On this basis, we established teaching reform groups for each subject, widely solicited opinions from the masses inside and outside the school, and compiled teaching outlines and new textbooks for each subject. The teaching method abandoned the pouring method and insisted on the inductive method; implemented the principle of combining theory with practice; implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers"; teachers and students prepared lessons together, taught and learned from each other, and improved teaching; in teaching, students were encouraged to think independently and express independent views. At the same time, workers, peasants, and soldiers were frequently invited to give lectures on campus.

We mobilized the masses to carry out the educational revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people have limitless creative power." In resuming classes to carry out the revolution and carrying out educational reforms, we followed Chairman Mao's teachings, believed in the masses, relied on the masses, and respected the masses' pioneering spirit. In practice, we taught while reforming. The leadership generally did not set any frameworks, and each grade and class could put forward their own opinions based on their specific situations. For those who took a detour, encountered setbacks, or failed temporarily, we did not blame them but encouraged teachers and students to summarize their experiences and lessons, overcome difficulties, and try again. For good examples, the leadership promptly summarized and exchanged experiences. Especially for those teachers and students who dared to explore and experiment, we encouraged them to boldly practice and create. The class resumption plans of many classes were jointly discussed and formulated by PLA comrades, teachers, and student cadres, and then discussed by the masses, with collective wisdom. In teaching, students who could understand were allowed to learn and practice on their own; those who could teach were allowed to teach on their own.

To carry out teaching reforms, we must break away from superstitions, liberate our minds, and dare to take the lead. When we first resumed classes, the main problem we encountered was the textbook problem. The past textbooks had many problems and should be criticized. However, teachers had mental barriers and dared not edit and select textbooks. What should we do? The teachers studied together Chairman Mao's quotations: "Learning warfare from warfare—this is our main method." Chairman Mao's teachings enhanced the teachers' confidence, and they decided to produce new proletarian textbooks.

The educational revolution is a new thing. We have just started practicing, and there are many new problems to explore. At present, our school is mobilizing all revolutionary teachers, students, and staff to have a great debate on the relationship between resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, and the relationship between emphasizing politics and professional skills. We firmly believe that as long as we follow Chairman Mao's teachings and rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school, we will definitely be able to carry out the educational revolution well and achieve our goals.

    在教学实践中进行教育革命
    北京二十三中革命委员会、军训团
    复课闹革命，是毛主席、党中央的方针，是当前学校中斗争的大方向。只有复课闹革命，才能结合本校的实际情况，更好地进行革命的大批判和本校的斗批改，进行无产阶级教育革命，创建崭新的无产阶级教育制度。
    以斗私批修为纲，加强思想教育
    复课闹革命是一场政治斗争和思想斗争，它必然会引起校内外一系列的反应。如何使革命师生认清复课闹革命的伟大意义，积极投入这场斗争中去呢？毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。”我校革命师生，紧紧抓住“斗私，批修”这个纲，以“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗私心杂念，不断端正对复课闹革命的意义的认识，不断提高复课闹革命的责任感和积极性。
    复课闹革命以后，有些学生认为复课就是复旧，没意思，“不出去冲冲不象个造反派的样子”。毕业班的学生说：“我们没有复课闹革命的任务”。不少教师由于受了资产阶级反动路线不同程度的打击和迫害，不愿再作教师。有的教师怕字当头，怕讲错了，被抓小辫子，等等。
    针对这些活思想，我们组织革命师生带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，并且经常召开大、中、小型的活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，还特别组织了毛泽东思想学习班。革命干部、革命教职工、学生干部、红卫兵骨干和解放军同志，在学习班里共同学习“老三篇”，学习年四旺狠斗“私”字一闪念的精神，亮私心，论危害，挖根源，明方向，大大提高了广大师生的革命积极性。参加学习班的一些同学，联系复课闹革命中的问题和自己的思想实际，主动批评了自己对教师的错误态度，表示要切实改正。不少教师对自己思想上存在的怨和怕，进行了深刻的自我批评。通过学习，不少教师去掉了怕字，坚定了信心，认识到教育革命，不能等待上级拿办法，不能光靠人家的经验，而应当按照毛主席的教导：“你要知道梨子的滋味，你就得变革梨子，亲口吃一吃。”到实践中去，一边教学，一边改革。
    破字当头，大胆革命
    毛主席教导我们说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”
    我校革命师生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，深入地揭发和批判了中国赫鲁晓夫疯狂反对和抵制毛主席的教育路线的罪行。通过大揭发、大批判，激起了革命师生强烈的阶级仇恨，提高了他们的政治觉悟，增强了他们的识别能力，为以后的复课闹革命，进行本单位的斗批改，打下了思想基础。
    在批判的基础上，着重进行了以下几方面的工作。
    一、大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威。我校革命师生，在复课闹革命中，把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切的地位，除坚持“天天读”以外，还新开了毛主席思想教育课。开设这门课的目的，就是使师生经常地、有针对性地学习和掌握毛泽东思想，促进人的思想革命化，更有效地进行教育革命。
    二、突出政治，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”又要求我们“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”。
    我们根据毛主席提出的教育方针和革命事业接班人五项条件，明确地指出，我们培养的学生，必须无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，自觉地活学活用毛主席著作，逐步树立无产阶级世界观，培养工农感情，热爱体力劳动，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中站稳无产阶级立场；要掌握文化科学基础知识，能直接参加一般工农业生产劳动，真正成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。为了实现这个目标，我们把阶级斗争作为一门主课。目前，就是上好无产阶级文化大革命课，继续批判修正主义教育路线，进行无产阶级教育革命。同时，我们也和工厂、农村挂钩，让学生学工、学农。学工，每周安排半天生产劳动；学农，准备集中在农忙季节，让学生参加农业生产劳动。
    三、在党的绝对领导下，无产阶级革命派掌好权、用好权。
    毛主席教导我们说：“资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了”。十七年来，党内一小撮走资派窃取了教育的领导权，资产阶级知识分子长期统治着我们的学校。在文化大革命中，我校无产阶级革命派从他们手中把权夺了回来，建立了革命委员会。我们改革了领导体制，打碎了过去以教学为主的一套办事机构，在校革委会下，设立了政治处、教学处和总务处，吸收革命学生、革命教师、革命工人参加；各年级成立年级委员会和连队委员会，年级和连队设立专职（暂设兼职）政治工作人员，教学班设政治辅导员；取消教研组，教师编入固定年级，和学生一起学习政治，参加劳动和军政训练。
    四、改革教学方针、教学内容和方法。
    在复课闹革命中，我们精简了课程设置，有些课程削减了，有些课程合并了，同时增设了工农业生产知识，军事体育等课程。政治、语文、历史课以毛主席著作为基本教材，理科教材目前删繁就简。在这个基础上，成立各科教改小组，广泛征求校内外群众的意见，分别编写出各科教学大纲，编写新教材。教学方法废止注入式，坚持启发式；贯彻理论联系实际的原则；贯彻毛主席关于“官教兵、兵教官、兵教兵”的指示，师生共同备课，互教互学，教学相长；在教学中鼓励学生独立思考，发表独立见解。同时，经常请工农兵到校讲课。
    放手发动群众进行教育革命
    毛主席教导我们说：“人民群众有无限的创造力”。在复课闹革命中，在进行教改的时候，我们遵照毛主席的教导，相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神，在实践中边教学，边改革。领导上一般不定什么框框，各年级、各班可以根据自己的具体情况，提出自己的意见。对一时走了弯路，遭到挫折或失败的，不加指责，而是鼓励师生总结经验教训，克服困难，重新去闯。对好的典型，领导上及时总结，交流经验。特别对那些敢于探索和试验的师生，鼓励他们大胆实践，大胆创造。许多班的复课计划，都是由解放军同志、教师、学生干部一起讨论制定，然后交群众讨论，群策群力搞出来的。在教学上，学生能懂的，就让他们自己学，自己练；能讲的，让他们自己讲。
    进行教学改革，必须破除迷信，解放思想，敢字当头。我们开始复课，首先遇到的问题，就是教材问题。过去的教材有许许多多的问题，应该进行批判。但是，教师思想上有框框，不敢动手去编写和选用教材。怎么办？教师们一起学习了毛主席语录：“从战争学习战争——这是我们的主要方法。”毛主席的教导增强了教师的信心，决心搞出无产阶级的新教材。
    教育革命是一个新事物。我们刚刚开始实践，有许多新问题正在探索。目前，我校正在就复课和闹革命的关系，突出政治和业务的关系等问题，发动全校的革命师生员工进行大鸣、大放、大辩论。我们坚信，只要我们遵照毛主席的教导，依靠学校中广大革命的学生、革命的教员、革命的工人，就一定能把教育革命搞好，就一定能达到我们的目的。
