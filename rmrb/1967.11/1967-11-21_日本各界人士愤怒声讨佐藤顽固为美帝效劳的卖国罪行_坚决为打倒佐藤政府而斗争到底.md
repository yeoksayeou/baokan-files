Japanese progressive mass organizations and prominent figures have issued statements and speeches, angrily denouncing Japanese Prime Minister Sato Eisaku for betraying the interests of the Japanese people, persistently opposing the Chinese people, and stubbornly serving the U.S. imperialists' aggression in Vietnam.

The General Headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine) issued a statement on the 17th, pointing out that Sato, in his talks with U.S. President Johnson, once again yielded to the U.S. imperialists, continuing to provide Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to the United States as military bases for its aggression in Asia. This treasonous act has added a shameful page to his anti-people's criminal record.

The statement concludes: "We, together with the broad masses of the Japanese people, strongly condemn Sato's treasonous behavior. We stand firmly with the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, and all the people of Asia to launch a resolute struggle to thoroughly smash the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries."

Sakae Motojiro, Chairman of the Japan Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, said in a speech that Sato, in the Sato-Johnson joint communiqué, openly shouted against China and supported the U.S. aggression in Vietnam. This is a challenge to the Chinese and Vietnamese people and a challenge to the Japanese people. Sato's conspiracy activities in the United States have once again exposed the Japanese reactionary government as the most loyal accomplice of U.S. imperialist aggression.

Sakae emphasized that Sato did not go to the United States to resolve the Okinawa issue but to sell Okinawa and the Japanese people. He said, "We must not harbor any illusions about U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionary government. Only through resolute struggle can we achieve the return of Okinawa to Japan."

Hajime Hasegawa, Executive Director of the Japan Association for the Promotion of International Trade, said in a speech on the 18th that Sato, in this round of talks, signed a treasonous contract and promised Johnson that Japan would intensify its hostile activities against China, strongly support the U.S. aggression in Vietnam, and strengthen aid to anti-communist countries in Asia. This shows that Sato Eisaku has more actively taken the road of destroying Sino-Japanese relations and participating in the war of aggression.

Hajime said: "We must unite closely with the revolutionary people of all countries in the world, oppose Japan's participation in the U.S. imperialists' war of aggression, oppose the Japanese reactionaries' destruction of Sino-Japanese relations, and struggle to the end to overthrow the reactionary Sato government."

Japanese youth strongly oppose Sato's overseas activities to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. The picture shows demonstrators bravely charging at the police with sticks.

    日本各界人士愤怒声讨佐藤顽固为美帝效劳的卖国罪行
    坚决为打倒佐藤政府而斗争到底
    据新华社十八日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日本进步的群众团体、著名人士发表声明和谈话，愤怒声讨日本首相佐藤荣作出卖日本民族利益，坚持与中国人民为敌，顽固地为美帝侵越战争效劳的卖国行径。
    日中友协（正统）总部十七日发表的声明指出，佐藤在同美国总统约翰逊的会谈中再次屈从美帝，继续把冲绳和小笠原群岛提供给美国作为它侵略亚洲的军事基地的卖国罪行，为他反人民的罪恶史增添了可耻的一页。
    声明最后说：“我们同日本广大人民一道强烈谴责佐藤的卖国行为，并且同中国人民、越南人民和亚洲全体人民紧密地团结起来，为彻底粉碎美帝国主义和日本反动派的侵略和战争政策而展开坚决的斗争。”
    亚非人民团结日本委员会理事长坂本德松发表谈话说，佐藤在约翰逊—佐藤会谈公报中，公然叫嚷反对中国，支持美国侵略越南，这是对中国和越南人民的挑战，是对日本人民的挑战。这次佐藤在美国的阴谋活动，又一次暴露了日本反动政府是美帝最忠实的侵略帮凶。
    坂本强调指出，佐藤不是为了解决冲绳问题而是为了出卖冲绳和日本人民而去美国的。他说，我们决不能对美帝国主义和日本反动政府寄予幻想，只有通过坚决斗争的道路，才能使冲绳归还日本。
    日本国际贸易促进协会专务理事萩原定司十八日发表谈话说，佐藤在这次会谈中签订了叛国的卖身契，并且向约翰逊保证，日本加强敌视中国的活动，大力支持美帝侵越战争和加强援助亚洲反共国家。这表明，佐藤荣作更积极地走上了破坏日中关系和参加侵略战争的道路。
    萩原说：“我们要同世界各国革命人民紧密地团结起来，反对日本参加美帝国主义的侵略战争，反对日本反动派破坏日中关系，并且为打倒反动的佐藤政府而奋斗到底。”（附图片）
