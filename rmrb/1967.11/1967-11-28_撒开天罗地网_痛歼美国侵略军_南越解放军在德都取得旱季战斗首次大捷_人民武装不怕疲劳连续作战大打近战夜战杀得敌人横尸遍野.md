The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Achieves the First Major Victory of the Dry Season in the Battle of Dak To

The People's Armed Forces, Undaunted by Fatigue, Fight Continuously, Engage in Close Combat and Night Battles, Leaving the Enemy's Corpses Scattered Everywhere

	Report compiled by this newspaper: Just as American imperialism is in a state of panic in South Vietnam, continuously sending in more troops in a vain attempt to salvage its failing cause, the brave people's liberation armed forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam have spread a net from heaven to earth in the Dak To area, mercilessly annihilating the American aggressors and achieving a brilliant victory in the first round of dry season battles this year.

	The Battle of Dak To began on November 4. From the start, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces displayed a spirit of fearlessness and the ability to fight continuously without rest, utilizing their strength in close combat to annihilate a large number of enemy forces. After eight days of battle, the liberation army had destroyed and severely damaged twelve enemy companies, including eleven companies of American aggressors, killing and wounding nearly 1,300 enemy soldiers, and shooting down thirteen helicopters.

	During the battle, the enemy hastily sent in 10,000 American and puppet troops for reinforcement and dispatched a large number of bombers in an attempt to rescue the besieged aggressors. However, these parachuted American troops landed right into the net that the South Vietnamese liberation army had already set up, and were annihilated. The enemy's bombers, due to the liberation army's close combat tactics that forced them close to the enemy, were unable to operate effectively, resulting in bombs being dropped on American positions, killing many American aggressors.

	The Battle of Dak To sent the American aggressors into a state of panic. Western news agencies exclaimed that this was a signal of the people's liberation armed forces launching the "dry season offensive."

	After annihilating a large number of enemy forces, the people's liberation army continued to lure the enemy in, attracting enemy reinforcements to this mountainous area, utilizing the advantageous terrain to attack and ambush the enemy from all sides, leaving the enemy exhausted and unable to cope.

	At a moment when the enemy was in a state of panic and disarray, the South Vietnamese liberation army's artillery experts struck unexpectedly, launching four fierce artillery barrages on the American supply base at Dak To airfield on November 15 and 16, destroying airport facilities, blowing up ammunition depots, and burning down the entire enemy camp. The enemy's transport planes could not land at this airfield.

	At the same time, the South Vietnamese liberation army did not give the enemy a chance to catch their breath, launching an attack on the enemy's positions on the night of the 16th. They captured the town of Tan Canh, four kilometers south of Dak To, completely controlling the town for an entire night, destroying various important enemy facilities. On the 18th and 19th, the people's liberation armed forces, with swift action, surrounded the two camps of the American 173rd Airborne Brigade on the 882 and 875 hills southwest of Dak To, and completely annihilated the first paratrooper battalion. From the 16th to the 19th, the South Vietnamese liberation army killed more than 1,100 enemy soldiers, including 710 American soldiers.

	The enemy, beaten to a pulp, continuously called for help from nearby American bases via radio. However, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces set up an anti-aircraft shooting net, preventing American helicopters carrying reinforcements and ammunition from landing. Reinforcement troops coming by land were also ambushed by liberation army soldiers hidden in the jungle, resulting in many casualties. The enemy, like a wounded beast, struggled desperately, sending in a large number of B-52 bombers for indiscriminate bombing. However, the clever and agile liberation army soldiers had already dug trenches, making it impossible for the bombs to hit them. As soon as the bombing stopped, the soldiers jumped out of the trenches and fiercely attacked the enemy charging up the hill.

	On the 22nd, after annihilating a large number of enemy forces, the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces quickly withdrew from the battle. When the enemy reinforcements arrived, all they found were piles of American bandit corpses and wounded soldiers. Western reporters sent back reports from the battlefield saying that when they arrived, they saw "piles of American corpses." The American aggressors suffered a major defeat.

	The victory at Dak To is another resounding song of people's war, following the great victory of the rainy season, by the South Vietnamese people's liberation armed forces.

    撒开天罗地网　痛歼美国侵略军
    南越解放军在德都取得旱季战斗首次大捷
    人民武装不怕疲劳连续作战大打近战夜战杀得敌人横尸遍野
    本报综合报道：正当美帝国主义在南越焦头烂额，不断增派侵略军，妄想挽救它失败的命运时，英勇的越南南方昆嵩省人民解放武装力量在德都地区撒开天罗地网，痛歼美国侵略军，取得今年旱季战斗第一回合的光辉胜利。
    德都战役是在十一月四日打响的。战斗一开始，南越解放武装力量发扬不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，发挥近战威力，大量歼灭敌人。经过八天战斗，解放军就消灭和重创敌人十二个连，其中包括美国侵略军十一个连，打死打伤敌人近一千三百名，击落直升飞机十三架。
    在战斗中，敌人慌忙增派一万美伪军去增援，并且派去大量轰炸机，妄想救出被解放军团团围困的侵略军。但是，这些空投下的美军一下地就陷入了南越解放军早已布置好的罗网里给歼灭了。而敌人的轰炸机，由于南越解放军大打近战，逼近敌人，无法施展，结果把炸弹扔到美军阵地，炸死许多美国侵略军。
    德都歼灭战使美国侵略军惊慌万状。西方通讯社惊呼这是人民解放武装力量发动“旱季攻势的一个信号”。
    人民解放军在大量歼敌之后，进一步把敌人放进来打，吸引敌人增援部队到这个山区，利用有利地形，到处袭击和伏击敌人，弄得敌人顾此失彼，疲劳不堪。
    在敌人惊魂不定，狼狈万状时刻，南越解放军神炮手又出其不意，接连在十一月十五日、十六日两天，四次对美军供应基地德都美军机场发动猛烈炮轰，击毁机场设备，摧毁弹药库，把敌军营地全部烧光。美伪军赖以接济的运输机无法在这个机场降落。
    同时，南越解放军不给敌人喘息机会，又在十六日夜间开始对敌人阵地发起进攻。他们攻克在德都南面四公里的新景镇，完全控制这个镇一整夜，摧毁敌人各种重要机构。十八日和十九日两天，人民解放武装力量以神速行动包围了德都西南八八二和八七五高地的美国一七三空降旅的两个营，并且全歼第一伞兵营。从十六日到十九日，南越解放军共歼敌一千一百多名，其中美军七百一十名。
    被打得焦头烂额的敌人曾经不断用无线电向四周美军基地求援。但是，南越解放武装力量组织了对空射击网，使运送援兵和弹药的美国直升飞机无法降落。而通过陆路的救援部队，一路上又遭到隐蔽在丛林中的解放军战士的狙击，被打死打伤许多人。敌人象受伤的野兽，拚命挣扎，派出大量B—52轰炸机进行狂轰滥炸。可是机智灵活的解放军战士们早已挖好了坑道工事，根本炸不着。而轰炸刚一结束，战士们就从坑道里跳出来猛烈杀伤冲上山来的敌人。
    二十二日，南越人民解放武装力量在歼灭大量敌人有生力量之后，迅速撤出战斗。等增援敌人赶到时，只剩下一片美国强盗的死尸和伤兵。西方记者从战地发回的报道说，当他们到达那里时，看到“一堆堆美军尸体”。美国侵略军遭到一次大惨败。
    德都大捷是南越人民解放武装力量继雨季大捷后，又一支响彻云霄的人民战争凯歌。
