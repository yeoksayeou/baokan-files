Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's directive to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary workers of the Fengcheng Mining Bureau in Jiangxi have been vigorously promoting the revolution and production, achieving tremendous successes. The average daily output of raw coal in the bureau for the first half of October was more than double that of September, and more than 70% higher than the end of September.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat of the Fengcheng Mining Bureau have been vigorously promoting production underground and studying Chairman Mao's works above ground, conducting a thorough criticism of the revolution. They have used the "Three Articles" as a mirror to fight against selfishness, overcome selfish thoughts, and further establish the revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardship, not fearing fatigue, facing difficulties head-on, and working closely together. They strive to produce more and better coal for the country.

The leaders and revolutionary cadres at all levels of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat of the Fengcheng Mining Bureau have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, gone deep into the production front lines, worked underground with the workers, and promptly helped solve production difficulties, effectively promoting production.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary workers not only strive for attendance but also, taking Zhang Zedong, Norman Bethune, and the Old Man of the Mountains as examples, work hard and tirelessly. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary workers of the Jianxin Coal Mine launched a battle to seize high coal production on October 11th. On that day, they achieved a high production record of more than 2,200 tons of raw coal, exceeding the daily production plan by more than double.

Under the guidance of the great thought of Mao Zedong, the revolutionary and production situation in the Zaozhuang Coal Mining District of Shandong is excellent. The entire district, from the stationed military personnel to the miners, from the cadres to the family members, men, women, old, and young, everyone is concerned about national affairs and actively participating in the great proletarian cultural revolution.

The development of the revolutionary situation has powerfully promoted the development of coal production. The broad masses of workers in the entire district insist on conducting the revolution above ground and production below ground. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army's left-wing support troops, coal production has been increasing month by month. The entire district has exceeded the national coal production plan for September and October, and the quality of coal has also been significantly improved. The average daily production level in October was 15.9% higher than in September.
