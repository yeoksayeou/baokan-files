After the release of Chairman Mao's latest directive on revolutionary great unity, three revolutionary organizations at the Beijing Hotel—“Revolutionary Alliance,” “Rebellion, Criticism, and Reform Liaison Station,” and “Great Unity Liaison Station”—enthusiastically responded and, through joint consultation, quickly achieved revolutionary great unity.

However, when it came to forming the great unity committee, conflicts arose. The three organizations agreed to select twenty-one committee members and nine standing committee members. How should the quotas be allocated?

The “Revolutionary Alliance” believed that they had the most members, the strongest revolutionary spirit, and the greatest contributions, so they should have more committee members. Their proposal was: “Revolutionary Alliance” to have nine committee members and four standing committee members; “Rebellion, Criticism, and Reform Liaison Station” to have seven committee members and three standing committee members; “Great Unity Liaison Station” to have five committee members and two standing committee members. They felt that proposing such a ratio was already a very high standard. The “Great Unity Liaison Station” believed that organizations should not be distinguished by size or number of members. Although they had fewer members, they should not have fewer committee members. Therefore, they proposed that the quotas be evenly distributed among the three groups. The “Rebellion, Criticism, and Reform Liaison Station” thought that both proposals were acceptable, as long as their own interests were not affected.

Representatives from the various mass organizations held three consultations, but no results were achieved. One day passed, two days passed, three days passed. The movement needed leadership, and work needed to be done, but the leaders were still haggling at the negotiating table.

How to resolve the conflict? The PLA comrades and the hotel leaders conducted a serious study and unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's words had the highest authority and the greatest power. As long as the masses grasped Mao Zedong Thought, any problem could be solved. Therefore, they studied Chairman Mao's sayings with the leaders of the various organizations:

“One must advocate considering the overall situation. Every party member, every part of the work, every word or action, must start from the interests of the whole party and must not violate this principle.”

Chairman Mao's words were like sunlight, opening people's eyes. The leaders of the various mass organizations realized: fighting for positions and seats was fighting for the interests of small groups, not for the party or the people. They felt that continuing to “negotiate” in that way was unacceptable, betraying the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao and disappointing the trust of the broad masses of workers. They all decided to solve the problem of the great unity committee with a sense of urgency. At midnight, the leaders of all the mass organizations in the hotel gathered for a meeting.

The meeting began. The representative of the “Rebellion, Criticism, and Reform Liaison Station” spoke first, making a sincere self-criticism and expressing agreement with the “Revolutionary Alliance” having eleven committee members and the “Great Unity Liaison Station” having seven committee members. They were satisfied with having three committee members or even none.

The representatives of the “Revolutionary Alliance” and the “Great Unity Liaison Station” also spoke, each criticizing themselves and fighting their own “selfishness.” The more they talked, the more excited they became, and they all replaced “selfishness” with “publicness.”

Later, it was decided that each organization would send one person for consultation. After failing to reach an agreement in several days, this time they reached a consensus in just one minute: based on the proposal of the “Revolutionary Alliance” representative, each organization would select seven committee members and three standing committee members.

The agreement was reached, but during the election, a “storm” arose. The “Revolutionary Alliance” and the “Rebellion, Criticism, and Reform Liaison Station” quickly elected according to the specified quotas. Only the “Great Unity Liaison Station” delayed. After the other two organizations had finished their elections, they elected three leaders who had not been selected by the other two organizations, and only elected four people from their own organization.

The list was announced, and the other two organizations were deeply moved but firmly disagreed with this approach. The comrades of the “Great Unity Liaison Station” said: “Since we have achieved revolutionary great unity and become one faction, we are all the Mao Zedong Thought faction. Why should we still care about how many committee members each organization has?” Because the “Great Unity Liaison Station” insisted on this, the final great unity committee was elected according to their proposal.

    从争权到让权
    毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示发布后，北京饭店的三个革命组织——“革联”、“斗批改联络站”、“大联合联络站”热烈响应，经过共同协商，迅速实现了革命大联合。
    但是，在产生大联合委员会的问题上，却发生了矛盾。三个组织一致同意选二十一个委员，九个常委。名额如何分配呢？
      “革联”认为自己人数多，造反精神强，功劳大，委员应当多。提出的方案是：“革联”出九个委员，四个常委；“斗批改联络站”出七个委员，三个常委；“大联合联络站”出五个委员，两个常委。他们觉得，提出这样的比数，就是很高的风格了。“大联合联络站”认为，组织不分大小，人数不分多少，自己虽然人数少，委员绝不能少。因而，提议三家平均分配名额。“斗批改联络站”认为两家的方案都可以，反正自己都是七个委员，只要不触动自己这一派的利益就可以。
    各群众组织的代表进行了三次协商，毫无结果。一天过去了，两天过去了，三天过去了，运动需要人领导，工作需要人来抓，但是，头头们还在谈判桌上讨价还价。
    矛盾怎样解决呢？解放军同志和饭店领导同志，作了认真的研究，一致认为，毛主席的话威信最高，威力最大，只要群众掌握了毛泽东思想，无论什么问题都可以解决。于是，便和各组织的头头一起，反复学习毛主席的语录：
      “要提倡顾全大局。每一个党员，每一种局部工作，每一项言论或行动，都必须以全党利益为出发点，绝对不许可违反这个原则。”
    毛主席的话，象阳光一样，打开了人们的眼界。各群众组织的负责人认识到：争山头，争席位，是为小团体争权，不是为党为人民争权。觉得那样“谈判”下去，太不应该了，辜负了伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对不起广大职工的信赖，都决心以只争朝夕的精神，解决大联合委员会的问题。夜里十二点，全店各群众组织负责人聚在一起开会。
    开会了。最先发言的“斗批改联络站”的代表，作了诚恳的自我批评，表示同意“革联”有十一个委员，也同意“大联合联络站”有七个委员，他们只要三个委员，或者没有委员也可以。
    “革联”和“大联合联络站”的代表也接着发言。各自批评自己，各人斗各人的“私”字。大家越谈越热烈，越谈越激动，都把“私”字换成了“公”字。
    后来，决定三个组织各派一人协商。几天没有协商出结果，这次只用了一分钟就达成了协议：根据“革联”代表的提议，每个组织选七个委员、三个常委。
    协议达成了，想不到在选举的时候，又起了“风波”。“革联”和“斗批改联络站”很快地按照规定的名额选了出来。唯独“大联合联络站”迟迟不选。等其他两个组织选完了，他们把两个兄弟组织没有选上的头头，选上了三个，自己的组织，只选了四个人。
    名单公布出来，其他两个组织十分感动，可是坚决不同意这样做。“大联合联络站”的同志说：“我们既然实现了革命大联合，成了一派，都是毛泽东思想派，为什么还要管那个组织几个委员呢？”由于“大联合联络站”坚持这样做，最后，就按他们的意见选出大联合委员会。
