		Jiaxing County Creates Good Experience in Rural Mass Criticism
		Conducting Revolutionary Mass Criticism at the Production Team Level

		Five advantages:
		(1) Meetings are close by, everyone can attend, men, women, old and young can all participate, and the scope of education is wide.
		(2) Speeches are universal, mutually inspiring, familiar with the situation, easy to connect with reality, and convenient for the masses to educate themselves.
		(3) Meetings are convenient, and time is easy to arrange.
		(4) It is beneficial to seize the revolution and promote production.
		(5) It is beneficial to combine revolutionary mass criticism with the study of Chairman Mao's works more closely, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

		Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, November 21st - How to make the revolutionary mass criticism in rural areas more widely and deeply carried out? Zhejiang Province's Jiaxing County has conducted revolutionary mass criticism at the production team level and achieved good results. This approach is beneficial to closely connect with the local struggle, beneficial to mobilize the broadest masses, beneficial to seize the revolution and promote production, and has pushed the local mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high.

		Since April this year, Jiaxing County has conducted revolutionary mass criticism at the commune and production brigade levels, published some mass criticism columns, and held some criticism meetings. However, such large-scale activities did not give everyone the opportunity to participate, and the criticism was not deep enough. Later, some communes and brigades adopted the method of conducting revolutionary mass criticism at the production team level.

		Jiaxing County's revolutionary mass criticism at the production team level generally first criticized the reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" by Liu Shaoqi. Many poor and lower-middle peasants used their own experiences to angrily denounce Liu Shaoqi's shameless lies. Many people at the denunciation meetings recalled the bitterness of the old society and the sweetness of the new society, poured out their grievances, dug up the roots of bitterness, and aroused boundless hatred towards Liu Shaoqi. On this basis, many production teams further criticized Liu Shaoqi's advocacy of "three freedoms and one contract" and other black goods. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants used their personal experiences in the struggle between the two roads since liberation; on the one hand, they recalled the great achievements made by Chairman Mao's call and leadership of the poor and lower-middle peasants to organize mutual aid teams, cooperatives, and people's communes; on the other hand, they presented Liu Shaoqi's numerous crimes of slashing cooperatives and advocating "contracting production to households" for thorough criticism. The poor and lower-middle peasants of various production teams in Changqiao Brigade, Nanhu Commune, cited the specific facts of the weakening of collective economy, reduction of agricultural production, and difficulties in the lives of commune members after the capitalist roaders within the party slashed cooperatives and spread the evil wind of "three freedoms and one contract," and angrily denounced Liu Shaoqi's heinous crimes. Through in-depth criticism, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants loved Chairman Mao even more, loved the collective even more, loved socialism even more, and hated Liu Shaoqi and capitalism even more.

		The experience of Jiaxing County proves that conducting revolutionary mass criticism at the production team level has five major advantages:

		(1) Meetings are close by, everyone can attend, men, women, old and young can all participate, and the scope of education is wide. Many production teams, from children as young as seven or eight years old to elderly people in their seventies or eighties, even elderly people and women who had never participated in criticism meetings before, all participated in the criticism meetings, truly achieving household knowledge and deep impression.

		(2) Speeches are universal, mutually inspiring, familiar with the situation, easy to connect with reality, and convenient for the masses to educate themselves. Many production teams adopted the method of holding symposiums for criticism, with speeches unrestricted, one speaking, another responding, and thoroughly refuting Liu Shaoqi's fallacies.

		(3) Meetings are convenient, and time is easy to arrange. Meetings can be held in the evening, during daytime rest time, or even before and after meals.

		(4) It is beneficial to seize the revolution and promote production. In addition to thematic criticism, many production teams also combined current central work and production arrangements, using Chairman Mao's teachings to criticize Liu Shaoqi's revisionist black goods in management. Some also promptly improved unreasonable systems.

		(5) Finally, and most importantly, it is beneficial to combine revolutionary mass criticism with the study of Chairman Mao's works more closely, and to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Because the mass criticism at the production team level mobilized the broadest masses and further aroused everyone's deep class feelings of loving Chairman Mao, the enthusiasm of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's works has reached an unprecedented height. Every time a criticism meeting or other meeting is held, everyone first studies Chairman Mao's quotations. Many production teams originally studied Chairman Mao's works collectively every five days, now changed to studying every other day. In the fields, everyone also studies at any time. A new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has risen in the vast rural areas of Jiaxing County.

		Now, more and more production teams in Jiaxing County are, with "struggle against selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, combining current work such as autumn harvest distribution, further deepening the revolutionary mass criticism, determined to thoroughly bury Liu Shaoqi in the vast ocean of "people's war."

    嘉兴县创造农村大批判的好经验
    以生产队为单位开展革命大批判
    五大好处：（一）开会近，人到得齐，男女老少都能参加，受教育面广。（二）发言普遍，互相启发，情况熟悉，容易联系实际，便于群众自己教育自己。（三）开会方便，时间好安排。（四）有利于抓革命，促生产。（五）有利于把革命大批判和学习毛主席著作更加紧密结合起来，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮。
    新华社杭州二十一日电　怎样使农村的革命大批判更加广泛深入地开展下去？浙江省嘉兴县以生产队为单位开展革命的大批判，取得了很好的效果。这样做，有利于紧密结合当地的斗争实际，有利于最广泛地发动群众，有利于抓革命促生产，并且把当地活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新的高潮。
    嘉兴县从今年四月份以来，就以公社、生产大队为单位开展革命的大批判，出了一些大批判专栏，开了一些批判大会。但这种大范围的活动，有些人没有机会参加，批判也不够深入。后来，有些公社和大队就采取以生产队为单位的办法，开展革命的大批判。
    嘉兴县以生产队为单位开展的革命大批判，一般都首先批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”的反动谬论。许多贫下中农用自己的切身体会，愤怒地痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的无耻谰言。许多人在控诉会上忆旧社会的苦，思新社会的甜，倒苦水，挖苦根，激发了对中国赫鲁晓夫的无比仇恨。在这个基础上，许多生产队接着深入地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“三自一包”等黑货。广大贫下中农用解放以后两条道路斗争的亲身经历，一面回忆毛主席号召和领导贫下中农组织起来，由互助组、合作社到人民公社所取得的伟大成就；一面摆出中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社、鼓吹“包产到户”的大量罪行，进行彻底批判。南湖公社长桥大队各生产队的贫下中农，举出党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大砍合作社和大刮“三自一包”的阴风以后，使集体经济削弱，农业减产，社员生活困难等具体事实，愤怒地控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。通过深入的批判，广大贫下中农更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加热爱集体，更加热爱社会主义，更加痛恨中国赫鲁晓夫，更加痛恨资本主义。
    嘉兴县的经验证明，以生产队为单位开展革命的大批判，归结起来有五大好处：
    （一）开会近，人到得齐，男女老少都能参加，受教育面广。许多生产队从七八岁的儿童到七八十岁的老人，连从来没有参加过批判会的老人和妇女都参加了批判会，真正做到了家喻户晓，深入人心。
    （二）发言普遍，互相启发，情况熟悉，容易联系实际，便于群众自己教育自己。许多生产队采用座谈会的方式进行批判，发言不受拘束，你一言，他一语，把中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论批驳得体无完肤。
    （三）开会方便，时间好安排。晚上可以开，白天劳动休息时间也可以开，饭前饭后也可以谈。
    （四）有利于抓革命，促生产。许多生产队除了专题批判以外，还结合当前中心工作和生产安排，用毛主席的教导，批判中国赫鲁晓夫在经营管理上推行的修正主义黑货。有的还对不合理的制度及时作了改进。
    （五）最后，也是最最重要的一条好处是，有利于把革命的大批判和学习毛主席著作更加紧密地结合起来，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮。由于以生产队为单位开展的大批判最广泛地动员了群众，并且进一步激发了大家无限热爱毛主席的深厚阶级感情，广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作的积极性空前高涨。每次开批判会或者开其他的会，大家都要先学毛主席语录。许多生产队原来每五天集中学习一次毛主席著作，现在改成了隔天学习一次。田间地头，大家还随时学习。一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，已经在嘉兴县广大农村兴起。
    现在，嘉兴县越来越多的生产队，正以“斗私，批修”为纲，结合当前秋收分配等工作，进一步深入开展革命的大批判，决心把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底埋葬在“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。
