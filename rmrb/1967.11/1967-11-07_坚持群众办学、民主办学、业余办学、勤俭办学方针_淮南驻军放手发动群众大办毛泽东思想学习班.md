    Persist with the Policies of Mass Education, Democratic Education, Part-Time Education, and Thrifty Education
    The Troops in Huainan Mobilize the Masses to Establish Mao Zedong Thought Study Classes

    In urban areas, mining areas, and suburban areas, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have rapidly and widely been established. The mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has become more extensive and in-depth, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of the people of Huainan, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance, and promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

    Editor's Note: To establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, one must mobilize the masses to do so in order to truly succeed. The troops in Huainan have adhered to the policies of mass education, democratic education, part-time education, and thrifty education. In a short period, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up all over the city like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, which is the most powerful proof.

    Chairman Mao teaches us: "We have always advocated that the revolution relies on the masses, everyone participates, and opposes relying only on a few people to issue orders." Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes is the strongest wish and demand of millions of revolutionary masses. The broad revolutionary masses have the deepest class feelings for our most beloved red sun, Chairman Mao. They have boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty for the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. They are eager to study Chairman Mao's works and Mao Zedong Thought. As long as we firmly rely on the masses and everyone participates in establishing them, the broad revolutionary masses will definitely, with the highest enthusiasm, make the Mao Zedong Thought study classes lively and effective.

    According to the Xinhua News Agency, the People's Liberation Army unit stationed in Huainan, Anhui, has followed Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and respecting the masses' initiative. They have adhered to the policies of mass education, democratic education, part-time education, and thrifty education. They have mobilized the masses to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes. In urban areas, the municipal bureau, factories, and mines, workshops, and teams have established them; in suburban areas, communes, production brigades, and production teams have established them. In a short period, Mao Zedong Thought study classes have sprung up all over the mining area like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. Establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes has made the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works more extensive and in-depth, greatly promoting the ideological revolution of the people of Huainan, consolidating and developing the revolutionary great alliance, and promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

    The mass movement in Huainan to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes has been launched based on the troops' extensive propaganda of Chairman Mao's latest instructions during his inspection of North China, Central China, and East China. The troops in Huainan, with the deepest class feelings of boundless love, faith, admiration, and loyalty for the great leader Chairman Mao, have, with the most resolute determination, the highest enthusiasm, and the fastest speed, dispatched most of their cadres and soldiers to go deep into factories, offices, schools, residential areas, and rural communes and production teams. They have extensively propagated Chairman Mao's latest instructions, making them known to every household and child. Once Chairman Mao's latest instructions met the masses, they immediately turned into a tremendous material force. Revolutionary masses from various industries and systems have quickly taken action, one after another, requesting the army to send people to help establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes.

    Should the Mao Zedong Thought study classes be established by relying on the army, or should the broad revolutionary masses be mobilized to establish them? The military party committee believes: With "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself" as the key, establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes is a mass movement for the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, a movement for the ideological revolution of hundreds of millions of people, and a cause of millions of people. It must follow the mass line and extensively mobilize the masses to establish the classes. The army should establish them, gain experience, and pass on the fine traditions of the People's Liberation Army's "four firsts" and the "August First" spirit to the masses. However, the army's main task is to "build bridges and guide the way," using Mao Zedong Thought to arm the masses and mobilize the masses to establish and educate themselves. Under the army's strong help and influence, the masses' enthusiasm to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes has surged higher and higher. Many factory workshops, residential areas, and production teams have voluntarily organized part-time and night school study classes. In the nearly one hundred study classes organized by the Li Yi Mine Area, more than eighty were established by the masses themselves. Various types of study classes have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift in all undertakings, carried forward the spirit of the People's Liberation Army's "August First," and established the classes themselves with thrift, without spending a penny of the state's money, making the study classes into "Anti-Japanese Military and Political University"-style study classes.

    The Huainan Coal Mine is one of China's major coal mines, with a wide area and scattered mining areas. The army, based on the characteristics of the mining areas, has adopted the policy of establishing Mao Zedong Thought study classes according to local conditions, with decentralized and part-time classes as the main focus, combining a small number of centralized classes with a large number of decentralized classes. Among the more than 1,800 study classes in the city, the vast majority are mass part-time study classes established according to mining areas, systems, industries, and production units. The advantages of these part-time study classes are: first, they are convenient for the masses to enroll and can widely absorb the masses to participate; second, they are beneficial for "grasping the revolution and promoting production"; third, they are beneficial for mutual understanding, mutual communication, mutual promotion, and mutual progress; fourth, they are convenient for linking theory with practice, achieving learning, application, improvement, labor, and work simultaneously.

    After various study classes were established, the revolutionary masses enthusiastically invited the army to send people to guide them. The military party committee regarded guiding the local establishment of Mao Zedong Thought study classes as an important task of "supporting the left, supporting the army." They mobilized a large number of cadres and soldiers to actively help the locals establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes with the highest enthusiasm. Initially, some comrades in the army had difficulties and feared that they could not guide well. In response to this situation, the military party committee organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant discussions on the mass line, conducted in-depth ideological education on the mass line for the army, and made everyone clearly understand that guiding the masses to establish Mao Zedong Thought study classes, first of all, must have the spirit of being a good student, with the attitude of a student, respecting the masses as teachers, studying Chairman Mao's works together with the masses, and criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself together. The cadres and soldiers guiding the masses to establish study classes in the Li Er Mine first study Chairman Mao's works every day, thoroughly understand the spirit, seriously compare, and then lead the way in criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself in the study classes, touching the soul deeply, and playing a good leading role. The workers said: Chairman Mao calls on us to learn from the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army takes the lead in exposing their thoughts and criticizing revisionism, which is indeed a good example for us to learn from!

    In establishing the study classes, the army has adhered to democratic education. The enrollment of students is discussed and proposed by the masses; the leading cadre, from the core to the study group leader, is elected by the masses; the entire teaching content and teaching plan are also discussed and formulated by the masses. Everyone is a student and a teacher, collectively studying documents, proposing problems, and collectively researching and discussing. In the learning process, combined with active thoughts, in-depth class education is carried out. Vice Chairman Lin pointed out: "Political education mainly focuses on class education and active education." In addition to organizing students to recall the bloody history of the mine and family history in the past, the army also organized students to visit the "mass grave" and water prison where Japanese imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries slaughtered workers. In front of the "mass grave," a denunciation meeting was held. An old miner, Dai Youzhong, who escaped death in the old society, said: "Before liberation, we miners were like three stones pressing on a piece of meat, with nine deaths and one survival. Chairman Mao liberated us. We workers are bitter gourds on the same vine, with a common savior, a common class enemy, and a common struggle goal. Therefore, we have countless reasons to unite and no reason to split." Class education has greatly improved the students' class consciousness, deepened their class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, and promoted ideological revolution. They said: "Class education has made our hearts more connected. No matter how big the waves are, they cannot break the revolutionary great alliance."

    The study classes have resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's principle of "carrying out open, mass, self-criticism (each side only criticizes itself, not the other side), and thoroughly correcting it." Many comrades, under the slogan of "being more active in criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself, being more proactive in self-criticism, taking more responsibility, and implementing more actions," have voluntarily criticized themselves. In a study class in the Xie Er Mine, there were two leaders from two revolutionary mass organizations. Initially, they had serious antagonistic emotions and brought past materials to the study class, preparing for a big debate. After studying, both sides conducted serious self-criticism, eliminated prejudices, and deepened their feelings. They said: "Walls must be torn down, ditches must be filled, unity must be heart-to-heart, heart-to-heart must be self-criticism, and self-criticism must be criticizing revisionism." Both sides voluntarily canceled their flags and emblems, quickly achieving revolutionary great unity.

    The study classes also adopt the method of combining internal and external, upper and lower levels, learning, applying, working, and laboring simultaneously. The students in the Li Er Mine study class often report their learning experiences to the masses and listen to the masses' criticisms. Then, based on the masses' opinions, they return to the study class to further study and understand the documents, check and compare, and continuously improve their ideological awareness.

    坚持群众办学、民主办学、业余办学、勤俭办学方针
    淮南驻军放手发动群众大办毛泽东思想学习班
    在市区、在矿区、在郊区，毛泽东思想学习班迅速普遍兴办起来，活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更加广泛深入发展，大大促进了淮南人民的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，促进了革命的三结合。
    编者按：大办毛泽东思想学习班，只有放手发动群众来办，才能真正办好。淮南驻军坚持群众办学、民主办学、业余办学、勤俭办学的方针，在短时间内，毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋般地遍及全市，就是最有力的证明。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”举办毛泽东思想学习班，是千百万革命群众最强烈的愿望和要求。广大革命群众对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席怀着最深厚的阶级感情。对光焰无际的毛泽东思想无限热爱、无限崇拜、无限信仰、无限忠诚。对学习毛主席著作和毛泽东思想如饥似渴。只要我们坚决依靠群众，大家动手来办，广大革命群众，必定会以最高的积极性，把毛泽东思想学习班办得生气勃勃，办得卓有成效。
    本报讯　中国人民解放军驻安徽淮南市某部，遵循毛主席关于相信群众、依靠群众、尊重群众首创精神的教导，坚持群众办学、民主办学、业余办学、勤俭办学的方针，放手发动群众，大办毛泽东思想学习班。在市区，市局办，厂矿办，车间小组办，居民委员会也办；在郊区，公社办，大队办，生产队也办。在短时间内，毛泽东思想学习班象雨后春笋遍及全矿区。大办毛泽东思想学习班，使活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更加广泛、更加深入地发展，大大促进了淮南人民的思想革命化，巩固和发展了革命的大联合，促进了革命的“三结合”。
    淮南群众大办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮，是在驻军大张旗鼓宣传毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的最新指示的基础上开展起来的。淮南驻军怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚的深厚阶级感情，以最坚定的决心、最高的热情、最快的速度，抽出大部分干部和战士，深入到厂矿、机关、学校、居民区和农村人民公社、生产队，广泛宣传毛主席的最新指示，做到家喻户晓，妇孺皆知。毛主席的最新指示一旦和群众见面，立刻转化成巨大的物质力量。各行业、各系统的广大革命群众，迅速地行动起来，纷纷要求部队派人帮助大办毛泽东思想学习班。
    毛泽东思想学习班，是依靠部队办，还是发动广大革命群众来办？驻军党委认为：以“斗私，批修”为纲，大办毛泽东思想学习班，是毛泽东思想大普及的群众运动，是亿万群众的思想革命化运动，是千百万群众自己的事业，必须走群众路线，广泛发动群众办学。部队要办，要取得经验，要把解放军的四个第一、三八作风的优良传统传给群众；但是，部队的主要任务是“搭桥引路”，用毛泽东思想去武装群众，发动群众自己办学，自己教育自己。在部队的大力帮助和影响下，群众办毛泽东思想学习班的热潮一浪高过一浪。许多厂矿车间、居民点、生产队群众纷纷自动组织业余学习班、夜校学习班。李一矿区组织的近百个学习班中，就有八十多个是群众自己动手办起来的。各种类型的学习班遵循毛主席勤俭办一切事业的教导，发扬解放军的三八作风，自己动手，勤俭办学，不花国家一分钱，把学习班办成“抗大”式的学习班。
    淮南煤矿是我国大煤矿之一，地域宽广，矿区分散。部队根据矿区的特点，采取因地制宜办毛泽东思想学习班的方针，以分散的、业余的为主，将少量的集中办和大量的分散办相结合。全市一千八百多个学习班中，绝大多数学习班都是按矿区、按系统、按行业和生产单位举办的群众性的业余学习班。这种业余学习班的优点是：一，便利群众入学，能广泛吸收群众参加；二，有利于“抓革命，促生产”；三，有利于互相了解，互相交心，互相推动，互相促进；四，便于理论联系实际，做到边学习，边运用，边改进，边劳动，边工作。
    各种学习班纷纷建立后，革命群众都热情地邀请部队派人去辅导。部队党委把辅导地方办毛泽东思想学习班作为“三支”“两军”的重要任务，动员广大干部和战士以最高的热忱主动帮助地方办好毛泽东思想学习班。开初，部队有些同志有畏难情绪，怕辅导不好。针对上述情况，部队党委组织大家学习了毛主席有关群众路线的论述，对部队进行深入的群众路线的思想教育，使大家明确认识到，辅导群众开办毛泽东思想学习班，首先要有甘当小学生的精神，以小学生的态度，拜群众为师，同群众一块学习毛主席著作，一块斗私批修。李二矿辅导群众办学习班的干部和战士，每天自己首先学习毛主席著作，吃透精神，认真对照，然后在学习班上带头斗私批修，狠触灵魂，起了很好的带动作用。工人同志说：毛主席号召我们向解放军学习，解放军带头亮思想，斗私心，真是我们学习的好榜样！
    部队在办学习班中，坚持民主办学。入学人选，由群众讨论提出；领导班子，从领导核心到学习组长，由群众选举产生；整个教学内容、教学计划，也都由群众讨论制订。人人当学生，人人当先生，集体学习文件，提出问题，集体研究讨论。在学习过程中，结合活思想，深入进行阶级教育。林副主席指出：“政治教育主要是抓阶级教育，抓活的教育。”部队除发动学员回忆过去血泪斑斑的矿史、家史外，还发动学员参观了日本帝国主义和国民党反动派残害工人的“万人坑”和水牢，在“万人坑”前举行控诉大会。在旧社会死里逃生的老矿工戴友忠说：“解放前，我们矿工是三块石头压一块肉，九死一生。毛主席解放了我们，我们工人阶级是一根藤上的苦瓜，有共同的救命恩人，有共同的阶级敌人，有共同的斗争目标，因此，有千条万条理由联合，没有一条理由分裂。”阶级教育，大大提高了学员的阶级觉悟，加深了对毛主席著作的阶级感情，促进了思想革命化。他们说：“阶级教育使我们心连得更紧了，风浪再大，也打不垮革命的大联合。”
    学习班坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”的原则。许多同志在“斗私批修过程中比积极，自我批评比主动，承担责任比姿态，贯彻效果比行动”的口号下纷纷作自我批评。在谢二矿一个学习班学习的成员中，有两个革命群众组织的负责人，原来对立情绪很严重，到学习班时带来了过去的材料，准备大辩论一场。经过学习，双方进行了认真的自我批评，消除了隔阂，增进了感情，他们说：“墙要推倒，沟要填平，联合要连心，连心要交心，交心要斗私。”双方自动取消派旗、派章，很快实现了革命的大联合。
    学习班还采取内外结合、上下结合的办法，边学习，边运用，边工作，边劳动。李二矿学习班的学员，经常把自己学习中的心得体会，向群众汇报，听取群众的批评。然后根据群众的意见，回到学习班来，再进一步学习领会文件，对照检查，使思想认识不断得到提高。
