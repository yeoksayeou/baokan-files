Our great leader Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionaries who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end."

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are the sole correct line for us to carry out the educational revolution, and they are the great call to arms for thoroughly smashing the old educational system. Only by advancing along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line can we carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the schools through to the end.

With the help of the PLA comrades, our school achieved revolutionary great unity on March 16 and then achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Starting from April 3, we resumed classes and carried out the revolution. In the early days of resuming classes, some people were not clear in their minds about whom to rely on for the educational revolution. Students relied on teachers, teachers relied on cadres, and cadres relied on instructions and plans from above. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, we came to realize that to carry out the educational revolution well, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and rely on the broad revolutionary masses. "The masses are the real heroes." As long as the masses are fully mobilized, there will be a way. The broad revolutionary teachers and students are the direct victims of the revisionist educational line, and they feel the harm of the old educational system most deeply. They know the situation in the schools best and have the most say. We organized revolutionary teachers and students to actively learn from and apply Chairman Mao's instructions on the educational revolution, criticized the revisionist educational line, and at the same time organized revolutionary teachers and students to go deep into factories and rural areas to conduct investigations, seek advice from the workers and peasants, and summarize their own practical experiences to formulate a school educational reform plan, which is now being implemented.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have made us further understand that the educational revolution is the business of the masses. Only by relying on the masses and mobilizing the masses, fully arousing the masses' enthusiasm, forming a surging revolutionary army, and waging a people's war, can we carry out the educational revolution well. If we depart from the masses, we will achieve nothing.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions are an invincible ideological weapon. We must study them seriously, understand them deeply, and resolutely carry them out. We must follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating self" as the key link, forge ahead courageously, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end, turning our school into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    充分发动群众  搞好教育革命    
    北京市草场地中学革命委员会
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席最近教导我们：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”
    毛主席的最新指示，是我们进行教育革命的唯一的正确路线，是彻底粉碎旧教育制度的伟大动员令。只有沿着毛主席的革命路线前进，才能把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我校在解放军同志的帮助下，三月十六日实现了革命大联合，接着实现了革命的“三结合”，从四月三日开始复课闹革命。在复课初期，有些人对于依靠谁进行教育革命，思想上不很清楚，学生靠教师，教师靠干部，干部靠上面给办法发方案。经过学习毛主席著作，我们认识到，要搞好教育革命，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，必须依靠广大革命群众。“群众是真正的英雄”，只要群众充分发动起来，就会有办法。广大革命师生是修正主义教育路线的直接受害者，他们对旧教育制度的危害感受最深。他们最了解学校的情况，最有发言权。我们组织革命师生员工，活学活用毛主席关于教育革命的指示，批判了修正主义教育路线。同时，组织革命师生深入工厂、农村进行调查，向工农群众求教，并且总结了自己的实践经验，制定了学校教育改革方案，目前正在落实。
    毛主席的最新指示，使我们进一步体会到，教育革命是群众的事，只有依靠群众，发动群众，把群众的积极性充分调动起来，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，打一场人民战争，才能搞好教育革命。如果离开了群众，就会一事无成。
    毛主席的最新指示，是威力无比的思想武器。我们一定要认真学习，深刻领会，坚决贯彻执行。我们一定要沿着毛主席指引的方向，以“斗私，批修”为纲，披荆斩棘，奋勇前进，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，把我们学校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
