The process of resuming classes is a revolutionary process; without revolution, classes cannot be resumed. This is the deepest realization we have gained from our experience of resuming classes.

After the Party Central Committee issued the directive to immediately resume classes and make revolution, our school decided not only to resume all forty-six original classes but also to begin enrolling new students. However, some comrades thought that since the graduates had not been sent off, new students could not be admitted, making it difficult to proceed. Others thought that the school buildings needed repairs and there were no new textbooks, making it difficult to start classes immediately.

In response to these thoughts, we studied the relevant directives of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee and came to understand that while there are difficulties in resuming classes and making revolution, there are two attitudes towards these difficulties: one is to "remove all obstacles and strive for victory"; the other is to be passive and wait for objective conditions to change. To resume classes and make revolution, we must first have a revolutionary spirit that dares to face difficulties and a spirit that dares to practice revolution.

This study has mobilized the enthusiasm of the vast majority of revolutionary students, teachers, and workers in our school. Based on our school's conditions, we decided to change the higher grades to a two-shift system and assign administrative personnel to the front lines of teaching. This arrangement allows us to enroll six new classes. We also followed Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift in all undertakings, taking the initiative to repair the school buildings. Starting in September, all teachers in the school dedicate three and a half days a week to repairing the school buildings, while the rest of the time is spent on the Cultural Revolution. By the end of October, the school buildings were fully repaired, and more than two thousand students across the school were not affected by the lack of equipment in resuming classes and making revolution.

    要有勇于实践的革命精神
    复课的过程就是革命的过程，没有革命，课是复不好的。这是我们在复课中体会最深的一点。
    党中央发出了立即复课闹革命的指示后，我们学校决定，不仅要使原有的四十六班全部复课，同时还要着手招收新生入学。但是，有的同志认为，毕业生没有送走，新生没法进来，这样做有困难。也有的同志认为，校舍有待维修，教材没有新的，暂时不好上课。
    针对这种活思想，我们学习了毛主席、党中央有关指示，认识到：复课闹革命的困难是存在的，但对待困难有两种态度，一种是：“排除万难，去争取胜利”；一种是：消极被动，等待客观条件变化。复课闹革命，首先就要有藐视困难的革命精神，要有勇于实践的革命精神。
    这次学习调动了我们学校绝大部分革命学生、教师、工人的积极性。根据我们学校的条件，大家决定把高年级改成二部制，抽调行政人员深入教学第一线，这样安排，可以招收六个班的新生。我们还遵照毛主席勤俭办一切事业的教导，自己动手整修校舍。从九月份开始，全校老师每周抽出三个半天参加整修校舍的劳动，其余时间搞文化大革命。到十月底校舍已整修齐全，全校两千多学生没有因为设备不齐而影响复课闹革命。
