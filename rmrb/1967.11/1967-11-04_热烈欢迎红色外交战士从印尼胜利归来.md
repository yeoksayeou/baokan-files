The entire staff of the Chinese Embassy and Consulates in Indonesia, after enduring a serious struggle against the Indonesian reactionaries, yesterday triumphantly returned to the capital of our great motherland, Beijing, and to the side of the great leader Chairman Mao. We, the people of the entire nation, extend a warm welcome, heartfelt greetings, and the highest respect to our heroic red diplomats!

For many years, our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia have followed the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people, and striving to enhance the combat friendship between the two peoples in their common struggle against imperialism and neo-colonialism led by the United States, fulfilling their duties as internationalists. Their work and struggle have added luster to the great socialist motherland and to the revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples.

Since the Indonesian fascist military clique launched a counter-revolutionary coup two years ago, our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, facing the mad anti-China frenzy of the Indonesian reactionaries with unyielding struggle, writing a poem of proletarian revolutionary diplomacy with their blood, and composing a triumphant song of Mao Zedong Thought. Dear comrades, you are truly worthy sons and daughters of the great socialist motherland, truly warriors of the proletarian revolution nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought! Your heroic deeds are the honor and pride of our socialist motherland!

In the face of increasingly fierce storms of anti-violence struggles, our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia have undergone severe tests and gained great tempering. The Indonesian fascist military regime subjected our diplomatic personnel to surveillance, threats, blockade, siege, armed attacks, and even openly shot our diplomats, truly barbaric to the extreme! However, our red diplomats, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, possess a fearless revolutionary spirit. They treat the enemy as dirt, disregarding their own lives; in the face of the guns and bayonets of the Indonesian reactionary police and fascist thugs, they stand firm; in the anti-China waves of the Indonesian reactionaries, they stand unyielding. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they have fought bravely to defend the dignity of the motherland and the combat friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples. No violence from the enemy can defeat them; all the enemy's plots are crushed to pieces! The moving struggle of our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia has greatly dampened the arrogance of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and greatly boosted the morale of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Indonesian fascist military regime has committed all kinds of fascist atrocities against our diplomatic personnel, using every vile means, but it had to declare its shameful defeat in the face of the heroic collective of twenty Chinese diplomatic warriors. Now, the Indonesian reactionary government has taken the foolish step of unilaterally severing diplomatic relations, which only exposes its desperate plight and its extremely weak nature. The heinous crimes of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique in destroying the diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia will surely be thoroughly settled by the Indonesian people!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the face of beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice." Revolutionary warriors must "crush all enemies and never be subdued by them." The victorious struggle of our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia against violence is a great inspiration to the Indonesian people, Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese, and all revolutionary peoples of the world. It once again shows that imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. As long as the revolutionary peoples are armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, they can defeat any brutal enemy.

The Indonesian reactionary government savagely expelled our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia, but it can never block the widespread dissemination of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, damage the lofty prestige of the great People's Republic of China, destroy the combat friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, or erase the heroic image of our red diplomats. All this will forever stir up revolutionary waves in the hearts of the broad Indonesian people.

Our diplomatic personnel in Indonesia have returned to the motherland at a time when the great proletarian cultural revolution in our country has achieved decisive victories. This unprecedented revolution has shaken the entire world and inspired the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. Today, the Indonesian people are rising from the bloodshed, burying their fallen comrades, and beginning new battles. They have already ignited the sparks of revolutionary armed struggle. The disaster-stricken Indonesia has sounded the battle call. The Chinese people will always stand heart to heart with the Indonesian people. We firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people. We are deeply convinced that the Indonesian people, with their glorious revolutionary traditions, will surely achieve final victory in their revolutionary struggle.

    热烈欢迎红色外交战士从印尼胜利归来 
    本报评论员
    我国驻印尼大使馆和领事馆全体人员，在经历了同印尼反动派的严重斗争之后，昨天，已经胜利地回到了伟大祖国的首都北京，回到了伟大领袖毛主席的身边。我们全国人民对英雄的红色外交战士，表示热烈的欢迎、亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意！
    多年来，我国驻印尼外交人员，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争，努力增进两国人民在反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中发展起来的战斗友谊，克尽了无产阶级国际主义的职责。他们的工作和斗争，为伟大的社会主义祖国，为中国印尼两国人民的革命友谊增添了光辉。
    自从印尼法西斯军人集团发动反革命政变以来的两年中，我国驻印尼外交人员，高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，面对印尼反动派的疯狂反华，进行了不屈不挠的斗争，用自己的鲜血写下一首无产阶级革命外交的诗篇，谱出了一曲毛泽东思想的凯歌。亲爱的同志们，你们不愧为伟大社会主义祖国的好儿女，不愧是毛泽东思想哺育的无产阶级革命战士！你们的英雄事迹，是我们社会主义祖国的荣誉和骄傲！
    在一次比一次猛烈的抗暴斗争的暴风雨中，我国驻印尼外交人员经历了严峻的考验，得到了很大的锻炼。印尼法西斯军人政权对于我国外交人员进行监视恐吓，封锁围困，武装袭击，甚至公然枪伤我外交人员，真是野蛮至极！然而，用毛泽东思想武装起来的我国红色外交战士，具有大无畏的革命精神。他们视敌人如粪土，置生命于度外；在印尼反动军警和法西斯暴徒的枪口刺刀面前，横眉冷笑；在印尼反动派的反华恶浪之中，岿然屹立。他们在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，为捍卫祖国的尊严，捍卫中国印尼人民的战斗友谊而进行了英勇的斗争。敌人的任何暴力，都不能战胜他们；敌人的任何阴谋，都被碾得粉碎！我国驻印尼外交人员的可歌可泣的斗争，大灭了美帝国主义及其走狗的威风，大长了世界革命人民的志气。
    印尼法西斯军人政权对我外交人员干尽了种种法西斯暴行，使尽了一切卑鄙的手段，然而，它在二十名中国外交战士组成的英雄集体的面前不得不宣告自己可耻的失败。现在，印尼反动政府采取了悍然中断两国外交关系的愚蠢做法，这只能更加暴露它无计可施的窘态，十分虚弱的本质。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团破坏中国印尼两国外交关系的滔天罪行，终将遭到印尼人民的彻底清算！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”革命战士
  “要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”。我国驻印尼外交人员英勇抗暴斗争的胜利，对于印尼人民、印尼爱国华侨和全世界的革命人民，都是一个巨大的鼓舞。它再一次表明，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。革命人民只要有了伟大的毛泽东思想的武装，就能够打败任何残暴的敌人。
    印尼反动政府野蛮地赶走我国驻印尼外交人员，但是，它绝对阻挡不了光焰无际的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，损害不了伟大的中华人民共和国的崇高威望，破坏不了中国印尼两国人民的战斗友谊，磨灭不了我国红色外交战士的英雄形象。这一切，必将永远在广大印尼人民心中激荡起革命的狂澜。
    我国驻印尼外交人员回到了祖国，正是祖国的无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性的伟大胜利的时刻。这场史无前例的大革命，震动着整个世界，鼓舞着各国人民的革命斗争。今天，印尼人民正在从血泊中站起来，掩埋好同伴的尸体，开始了新的战斗。他们已经点起了革命武装斗争的星星之火。灾难深重的印尼，已经响起了战斗的号角。中国人民永远同印尼人民心连着心。我们坚决支持印尼人民的革命斗争。我们深信，具有光荣革命传统的印尼人民，必将取得革命斗争的最后胜利。
