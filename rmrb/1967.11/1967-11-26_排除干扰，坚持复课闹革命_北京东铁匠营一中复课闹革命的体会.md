Beijing Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School is a junior high school with over 1,100 students. Since April 27, the entire school has started resuming classes and making revolution. Despite various interferences, classes have never been interrupted. Currently, all teachers and students are further advancing the campaign of "Fighting Selfishness and Criticizing Revisionism" to resume classes and make revolution.

Guiding the Resumption of Classes and Revolution with Mao Zedong Thought

Resuming classes and making revolution is a new task. At that time, the school had no ready-made experience, and there were many practical difficulties. However, in the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, they deeply felt that "No matter how difficult, with Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult." Therefore, they took studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the central task of resuming classes and making revolution, using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the process.

After the school's provisional revolutionary committee proposed resuming classes and making revolution, most teachers and students supported it. However, there was some resistance among a few teachers and students. From the teachers' perspective, the main issue was fear: fear that the old methods no longer worked and there were no new methods; fear of being criticized for teaching incorrectly; and fear of students not listening. From the students' perspective, the main issue was that they had become restless and couldn't sit still; some students also had antagonistic feelings towards some teachers.

The provisional revolutionary committee addressed the teachers' and students' thoughts by focusing on political and ideological work. On one hand, they organized teachers and students to study the "Three Articles," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and Chairman Mao's instructions on resuming classes and making revolution. On the other hand, they went deep into the teachers' and students' groups, having heart-to-heart talks. Then, they encouraged teachers to talk to students, discussing together how to resume classes and make revolution. Through these heart-to-heart talks, the antagonistic feelings between teachers and students were quickly resolved. Thus, resuming classes and making revolution had a solid foundation. Students said, "Resuming classes and making revolution is Chairman Mao's instruction, we will definitely follow it! If we are restless, we will bring it back under control."

After the students stabilized, the provisional revolutionary committee organized teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's "May 7 Directive" and the "Sixteen Points," proposing to carry out an educational revolution. Chairman Mao said, "Students are the same, with learning as the main focus, also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie." Following Chairman Mao's instructions, they resumed classes in physics, mathematics, biology, and foreign languages. In the teaching practice, they taught and revised simultaneously. They also allocated some time to organize students to participate in labor at nearby production brigades to learn agriculture.

Firmly Grasping the Direction of the Struggle

After Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School resumed classes and made revolution for a period, the provisional revolutionary committee conducted a rectification. At this time, a few people with ulterior motives deceived a small number of the masses, seized on some shortcomings and errors of the provisional revolutionary committee during the rectification, exaggerated them, and even openly instigated armed struggles, disrupting the resumption of classes and making revolution, attempting to overthrow the provisional revolutionary committee. How should they deal with this trend? Some members of the provisional revolutionary committee suggested stopping classes and focusing on revolution, organizing forces to "strike back comprehensively" against these people. With the help of the PLA comrades, they calmly analyzed the situation, further studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and realized that only a few bad people truly wanted to overthrow the provisional revolutionary committee, while the majority had issues of understanding and were deceived. They should be persuaded and educated, following the spirit of "unity-criticism and self-criticism-unity" to resolve the issue. If they stopped classes and made revolution, abandoned the revolutionary criticism, and concentrated on counterattacking the majority of the deceived masses, they would shift the direction of the struggle, falling into the trap of those with ulterior motives. Therefore, they adopted the method of heart-to-heart talks to persuade and educate the deceived masses patiently. At the same time, they concentrated their efforts on carrying out revolutionary criticism, directing the struggle towards the capitalist-roaders in the party headed by China's Khrushchev. In this way, they united everyone who could be united, isolated a few bad people, overcame interference, and persisted in resuming classes and making revolution.

Establishing a New Revolutionary Order

The revolutionary teachers and students of Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School deeply felt in the practice of resuming classes and making revolution that without establishing a new revolutionary order, resuming classes and making revolution could not proceed smoothly.

A part of the students in Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School were influenced by the anarchist trend in society, had poor organization and discipline, came and went as they pleased, made noise in class, and skipped revolutionary criticism sessions. These negative tendencies seriously affected the resumption of classes and making revolution. For this, the provisional revolutionary committee organized the entire school's teachers and students to seriously study Chairman Mao's teachings on strengthening organization and discipline, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to strongly oppose anarchism.

Based on studying Chairman Mao's works, the provisional revolutionary committee held a parents' meeting, mobilizing parents to do political and ideological work on their own children; the provisional revolutionary committee made corresponding regulations, requiring students to voluntarily comply; active students were organized to assist revolutionary teachers in maintaining classroom order; a rectification movement was launched to examine oneself and establish a new style of adhering to revolutionary discipline.

Through the struggle against anarchism, Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School initially established a new revolutionary order, ensuring the smooth progress of resuming classes and making revolution. Recently, they studied Chairman Mao's instructions to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," fiercely fighting against the "self" in their minds, consolidating the new revolutionary order.

Properly Handling Teacher-Student Relationships

Teachers and students are the masters of the school, and their relationship has a crucial impact on resuming classes and making revolution. Most teachers in Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, fought alongside the students, changing the past teacher-student relationship of "I am in charge of you, and you listen to me" to a relationship of equality and closeness. However, after resuming classes and making revolution, some teachers thought they were teachers and should educate students, and students must listen to them; otherwise, teaching work could not be carried out. Some students also did not respect teachers, and whatever the issue, they would "rebel." Thus, antagonistic feelings between some teachers and students resurfaced.

After discovering this problem, the provisional revolutionary committee went to the classes to investigate and study. Then, they organized teachers and students to separately study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and established the institution of teaching democratic meetings: one afternoon per week was dedicated to students giving feedback to teachers. Teachers humbly accepted the students' correct opinions and reformed teaching methods and content based on these opinions. Therefore, they realized that the teacher-student relationship of "I teach you, and you listen to me" must be thoroughly eliminated, establishing a revolutionary, comrade-like teacher-student relationship. Only in this way could teaching be improved, and it was also part of the educational revolution.

The main aspect of the teacher-student conflict was with the teachers. Once the teachers' issues were resolved, the students' issues became easier to solve. The students of Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School saw that teachers could humbly accept their opinions in teaching, and they respected the teachers even more, actively assisting teachers in teaching well. A teaching and learning, mutually respectful, and mutually learning revolutionary comrade-like teacher-student relationship is forming in Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School.

In class affairs and extracurricular activities, Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School implemented a method of combining students managing themselves with teachers' (class advisors, now changed to political instructors) educational guidance. In this way, not only was the teacher-student relationship strengthened, but students' enthusiasm for caring about the collective was also brought into play.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School, in resuming classes and making revolution, consolidated and developed the great alliance of revolution, and in mid-September achieved the three-in-one combination of revolution, establishing the revolutionary committee. After the revolutionary committee was established, it pushed the resumption of classes and making revolution to a new stage. They closely combined the revolutionary criticism with the school's struggle, criticism, and reform, thoroughly criticizing China's Khrushchev's revisionist educational line, and firmly grasped the educational revolution.

After Chairman Mao issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism," the revolutionary teachers and students of Dongtiejiangcun No. 1 Middle School responded enthusiastically. Currently, all classes have established "fighting selfishness" courses, with teachers and students together studying Chairman Mao's works, exposing "self," revealing "self," and fighting "self," greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of teachers and students.

### 排除干扰，坚持复课闹革命——北京东铁匠营一中复课闹革命的体会

    排除干扰，坚持复课闹革命
    ——北京东铁匠营一中复课闹革命的体会
    北京东铁匠营一中是一所拥有一千一百多人的初级中学。从四月二十七日起，全校开始复课闹革命。虽经干扰，但从未中断。现在，全校师生正以“斗私，批修”为纲，更进一步地开展复课闹革命。
    用毛泽东思想统帅复课闹革命
    复课闹革命是个新的课题，当时这个学校还没有现成的经验，实际困难很多。但是他们在同资产阶级反动路线的斗争中，深刻体会到“千难万难，有了毛泽东思想就不难”。因此，他们把活学活用毛主席著作当作复课闹革命的中心任务，用毛泽东思想统帅复课闹革命。
    当学校的临时革命委员会提出复课闹革命以后，多数师生是拥护的。但是，在部分师生中间还存在着一些阻力。从教师方面来说，主要是个“怕”字。一怕旧的一套不行了，新的东西又没有，没有东西教学生；二怕教错了受批判；三怕学生不听话。从学生方面说，主要是心野了，坐不下来；也有些学生跟部分教师有对立情绪。
    临时革命委员会针对师生的活思想，大抓政治思想工作。一方面，他们组织师生学习“老三篇”、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和毛主席“复课闹革命”的指示。另一方面，他们分别深入到师生中间，分头谈心。然后，发动教师找学生谈心，一起商量如何复课闹革命。经过师生一起谈心，迅速消除了彼此的对立情绪。这样，复课闹革命就有了一定的基础。同学们说，复课闹革命是毛主席的指示，我们一定照办！心野了，我们就把它收回来。
    学生稳定下来以后，临时革命委员会就组织师生学习毛主席的“五·七”指示和“十六条”，提出搞教育革命。毛主席说：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但要学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。”他们遵照毛主席这一指示的精神，又复了物理、数学、生物、外国语等文化课。在教学实践中，边教边改。他们还抽出一定的时间，有计划地组织学生到附近的生产大队参加劳动，去学农。
    牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    东铁匠营一中复课闹革命进行了一个时期，临时革命委员会进行整风。这时，有几个别有用心的人，蒙蔽了一小部分群众，抓住临时革命委员会在整风中检查的一些缺点和错误，无限上纲，甚至公开挑起武斗，破坏复课闹革命，企图搞垮临时革命委员会。如何对待这股歪风呢？临时革命委员会有的成员主张把课停下来，专搞革命，组织力量对这部分人进行“全面还击”。在解放军同志帮助下，他们冷静地分析了形势，进一步学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，认识到真正想搞垮临时革命委员会的只是个别坏人，多数是认识问题，是受蒙蔽的，应该对他们进行说服教育的工作，本着“团结——批评和自我批评——团结”的精神，加以解决。如果停课闹革命，放弃革命的大批判，而集中力量去反击大部分受蒙蔽的群众，就会转移斗争大方向，正好上了别有用心的人的当。所以他们对受蒙蔽的群众采取了谈心的办法，进行了耐心的说服教育。与此同时，他们还集中力量进行革命的大批判，把斗争矛头指向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内走资派。这样，团结了一切可以团结的人，孤立了极少数的坏人，排除了干扰，坚持复课闹革命。
    建立革命的新秩序
    东铁匠营一中革命师生在复课闹革命的实践中，深深体会到不建立革命的新秩序，复课闹革命就无法顺利进行。
    东铁匠营一中有一部分同学，受了社会上无政府主义思潮的影响，组织性、纪律性很差，随便迟到早退，想来就来，想走就走，上课时起哄，大批判时溜号，这些不良倾向，严重地影响了复课闹革命。为此，临时革命委员会组织全校师生认真地学习了毛主席有关加强组织性、纪律性的教导，用毛泽东思想为武器，大反特反无政府主义。
    在学习毛主席著作的基础上，临时革命委员会召开了学生家长会，发动家长做自己孩子的政治思想工作；临时革命委员会做出相应规定，要求学生自觉遵守；把积极分子组织起来，协助革命教师维持课堂秩序；开展整风运动，检查自己，树立遵守革命纪律的新风尚。
    东铁匠营一中经过反无政府主义的斗争，初步建立起新的革命秩序，保证了复课闹革命的顺利进行。最近，他们学习了毛主席要斗私，批修的指示，狠斗头脑中的“私”字，巩固了革命新秩序。
    正确处理师生关系
    教师和学生是学校的主人，他们之间的关系如何，对复课闹革命有着极为重要的影响。东铁匠营一中的大多数教师，在无产阶级文化大革命中，和学生战斗在一起，改变了过去那种“我是管你的，你是听我的”的师生关系，建立起平等、亲密的师生关系。但是，复课闹革命后，一部分教师就认为自己是老师，老师就是教育学生的，学生必须听老师的，否则教学工作就开展不了。有些学生对老师也不尊重，不管正确与否，什么事情都“造反”。这样，一部分师生的对立情绪又发生了。
    临时革命委员会发现这一问题后，就下到班级里去调查研究。然后，组织教师和同学分头学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，并建立教学民主会的制度：每星期抽出一个下午，专门请学生给老师提意见。教师对同学的正确意见都虚心接受，并根据这些意见改革教学方法、教学内容。因此，他们认识到那种“我是教你的，你是听我的”的师生关系，必须彻底破除，建立革命的、同志式的师生关系，这样才能搞好教学，而且也是教育革命的内容之一。
    师生矛盾的主要方面，是在教师。教师的问题解决了，学生的问题就容易解决。东铁匠营一中的同学们，看到老师在教学上能够虚心听取他们的意见，对老师更加尊重，并主动地协助老师讲好课。一个教学相长、互相尊重、互相学习的革命同志式的师生关系，正在东铁匠营一中形成。
    在班级事务及课外活动方面，东铁匠营一中实行了学生自己管理自己和教师（班主任，现改为政治辅导员）的教育辅导相结合的办法。这样，不仅密切了师生关系，而且还发挥了学生关心集体的积极性。
               ×　×　×
    东铁匠营一中的革命师生，在复课闹革命中巩固和发展了革命的大联合，于九月中旬实现了革命的三结合，成立了革命委员会。革命委员会成立后，把复课闹革命推向一个新的阶段。他们把革命的大批判同本校的斗、批、改密切结合起来，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线，狠抓教育革命。
    毛主席发出“斗私，批修”的伟大号召后，东铁匠营一中的广大革命师生闻风而动。目前所有班级都设立了“斗私”课，教师跟同学一起，学习毛主席著作，摆“私”，亮“私”，斗“私”，大大地促进了师生思想革命化。
