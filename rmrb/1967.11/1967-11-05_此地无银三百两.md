"Here is no silver, three hundred taels." This is a joke used to mock those who deceive themselves and others. However, in real life, there are indeed such fools. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have recently played this ridiculous role once again.

The Soviet revisionist clique actually instructed their hired "scholar," Stepanian, to publicly publish an article, attempting to use "theory" to argue that there is no bourgeois privileged class in the Soviet Union. His basis is: "Socialism does not produce and will not produce new classes and strata." This is purely a clumsy argument.

Throughout the entire historical period of socialist society, there have been classes and class struggles. The Soviet Union is no exception. After the October Revolution, the reactionary rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union was overthrown, but capitalist forces still existed. At the same time, new bourgeois elements continued to emerge in society. As Lenin said: "The old generation has been eliminated, but on this soil, new generations will continue to emerge, because this soil has produced and is still producing many bourgeois."

The Khrushchev revisionist clique usurped the leadership of the party and the state, which was a counter-revolutionary restoration of the bourgeoisie. After this group of bourgeois representatives came to power, they implemented a series of revisionist policies, causing the capitalist forces in the Soviet Union to rapidly expand. New bourgeois elements not only emerged in large numbers but also occupied dominant positions in the party, government, economy, culture, and other sectors, thus forming a bourgeois privileged class in Soviet society. This privileged class is currently the main component of the Soviet bourgeoisie. How can this obvious fact be denied?

A group of managers in Soviet state-owned enterprises have turned socialist enterprises into capitalist enterprises for their own enrichment, arbitrarily plundering the fruits of workers' labor. Who are these "new entrepreneurs" if not the genuine bourgeois privileged class?

A group of managers in Soviet collective farms have turned socialist farms into their own domains, ruthlessly exploiting farmers, and engaging in speculative activities. Who are these new rich farmers if not the genuine bourgeois privileged class?

Those big and small officials in the Soviet party and government organs, relying on their power, engage in corruption, bribery, and live a life of extreme luxury. Who are these officials if not the genuine bourgeois privileged class?

There are also those writers and scholars who are raised and serve the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, making it their profession to spread bourgeois ideology and corrupt the minds of the Soviet people. Who are these hired pen-pushers if not the genuine bourgeois privileged class?

It is precisely this privileged class that is exercising brutal bourgeois dictatorship over the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique is their political representative. However, the mouthpieces of the Soviet revisionists shamelessly claim that the Soviet revisionist leadership is "representatives of the people," "servants of the people," "executors of the people's will," and that they are also "serving the people." This is utterly absurd!

The so-called "authority" you claim to have for "serving the people" is actually the privilege of ruling the people. Is there such a "servant" who rides on the heads of the masters and acts arbitrarily? You have fully restored capitalism in the Soviet Union, making the Soviet people once again fall into the status of oppressed and enslaved wage slaves. You execute the will of the bourgeois privileged class. You loyally serve the cause of capitalism and imperialism. You are thorough and through traitors, and the mortal enemies of the Soviet people.

Lenin once denounced those bourgeois advocates, saying: "They spend their lives studying how to shamelessly deceive; it is easy for them to deceive each other; but it will not be so easy to deceive the workers in this way." The bourgeois advocates like Stepanian, who rack their brains to cover up for the Soviet revisionist ruling clique and the privileged class they represent, are obviously in vain.

    此地无银三百两
    “此地无银三百两”。这是讽刺那些自欺欺人的蠢人的一个笑话。但是，在现实生活中，的确有类似的蠢人。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流最近又一次扮演了这种可笑的角色。
    苏修集团竟然指使他们的御用“学者”斯捷潘尼扬公开发表文章，企图从“理论”上来论证在苏联并不存在资产阶级特权阶层。他的根据是：“社会主义并不产生也不会产生新的阶级和阶层。”这纯粹是一种拙劣的狡辩。
    在社会主义社会的整个历史时期，都存在着阶级和阶级斗争。苏联当然也不例外。十月革命以后，苏联的地主和资产阶级的反动统治被推翻了，但是资本主义势力依然存在。同时，社会上还不断产生新的资产阶级分子。正如列宁所说的：“旧的一代被清除了，而在这块土壤上还会不断产生新的一代，因为这块土壤过去产生过、现在还在产生许许多多资产者。”
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺党和国家的领导，就是苏联资产阶级的反革命复辟。这一伙资产阶级代表人物上台以后，推行一系列修正主义政策，使苏联的资本主义势力急剧地膨胀起来。新的资产阶级分子不但大量地产生，而且他们在党、政、经济、文化等部门中占据了统治地位，从而形成了苏联社会上的资产阶级特权阶层。这个特权阶层，是目前苏联资产阶级的主要组成部分。这是人所共见的事实，怎么能够否认得了呢？
    苏联国营企业的一批负责人，把社会主义企业变成为他们发财致富的资本主义企业，任意侵吞工人的劳动果实。试问这些“新企业主”不是地地道道的资产阶级特权阶层又是什么？
    苏联集体农庄的一批负责人，把社会主义的农庄变成了他们的领地，肆意盘剥农民，大搞投机倒把活动。试问这些新富农不是地地道道的资产阶级特权阶层又是什么？
    苏联党政机关的那些大小头目，依仗权势，营私舞弊，受贿分赃，过着穷奢极欲的生活。这些官老爷不是地地道道的资产阶级特权阶层又是什么？
    还有那些被苏修统治集团豢养并忠心为他们服务的作家、学者，他们以散布资产阶级思想腐蚀苏联人民的心灵为职业。试问这些御用文人不是地地道道的资产阶级特权阶层又是什么？
    正是这个特权阶层，对苏联人民实行着残酷的资产阶级专政。苏修统治集团就是他们的政治代表。然而，苏修的喉舌却大言不惭地说什么苏修领导集团都是“人民的代表”、“人民的仆人”、“人民意志的执行者”，说什么他们也在“为人民服务”。真是荒唐透顶！
    你们这些权贵标榜的所谓“为人民服务”的职权实际上是统治人民的特权。难道有这样骑在主人头上作威作福的“仆人”吗？你们在苏联全面复辟资本主义，使苏联人民重新沦为被压迫、被奴役的雇佣奴隶。你们执行的是资产阶级特权阶层的意志。你们忠心耿耿地为资本主义事业服务，为帝国主义服务。你们是彻头彻尾的大工贼、大叛徒，是苏联人民不共戴天的死敌。
    列宁曾经斥责那些资产阶级辩护士说：他们“一生都在研究如何厚颜无耻地进行欺骗，他们互相欺骗是容易的；但是用这种方法来欺骗工人，就不会那样得心应手”。斯捷潘尼扬之流的资产阶级辩护士，挖空心思为苏修统治集团及其所代表的特权阶层打掩护，显然也是枉费心机的。
