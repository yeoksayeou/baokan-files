	Suhua Locomotive Depot of Harbin Railway Bureau's Suhua Division, with the help of a propaganda team from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, has been fighting against selfishness and criticizing revisionism. This has driven the coal-saving work forward, resulting in over 70 tons of coal saved for the nation in October.

	The coal consumption of Suhua Division's locomotives had previously far exceeded the plan, which drew the attention of revolutionary workers. Under the guidance of the propaganda team, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching on "saving every copper coin for the war and revolutionary cause." They launched a mass movement to fight against selfishness and criticize revisionism, quickly creating a wave of coal-saving across the entire depot. Revolutionary workers, undaunted by hardship and fatigue, racked their brains for solutions, plugged loopholes that led to coal waste, and carried out extensive technological innovations. Workers in the technical department brainstormed and successfully developed a multi-edge nozzle, significantly reducing the coal consumption of locomotives and improving their efficiency.

    绥化机务段节约煤成绩大
    哈尔滨铁路局绥化分局机务段的革命职工，在人民解放军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的帮助下，狠斗“私”字，狠批修正主义，推动了节煤工作，十月份为国家节约机车用煤七十吨以上。
    绥化分局机务段的机车用煤量，前一段时间大大超过计划。这件事引起了革命职工的重视。他们在毛泽东思想宣传队帮助下，认真学习毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业”的教导，发动群众性的斗私批修，推动全段很快出现了一个节约煤炭的热潮。广大革命职工不怕累，不怕苦，动脑筋，想办法，堵塞浪费煤炭的漏洞，大搞技术革新。技术室的革命职工开动脑筋，试制成功了多边型喷口，大大地减少了机车的耗煤量，提高了机车的效率。
