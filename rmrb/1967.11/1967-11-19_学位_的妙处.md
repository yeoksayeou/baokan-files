The benefits of "academic degrees" are significant. Graduate students, assistant professors, and professors are important channels through which the Soviet revisionist ruling clique cultivates successors to revisionism. A university graduate who has entered the workforce, if he has not prepared an assistant professor's thesis and obtained the title of assistant professor, will often work for many years without a raise. However, once he completes the assistant professor's thesis and obtains the assistant professor's degree, fame and fortune follow immediately, promotions come quickly, and salaries increase significantly. With an assistant professor's title, one can earn an additional 170 rubles per month. Adding other income from various positions, the salary becomes even more substantial.

In the Soviet Union, for the same work, those with a diploma earn more than those without. In schools, students with good exam scores can receive higher scholarships. Therefore, "grades" and "diplomas" become the top concerns of Soviet university students.

In institutions of higher learning, cheating during exams is widespread and blatant, reaching astonishing levels. Sometimes, even the Communist Youth League organizations help students cheat. Their justification for this open cheating is that if a student does poorly on exams, he will not receive a scholarship.

    “学位”的妙处
    研究生、副博士、博士，这是苏修统治集团培养修正主义接班人的重要途径。一个参加了工作的大学毕业生，如果没有准备好副博士论文，没有当上副博士，那么，往往工作好多年，工资也提不上去。而完成了副博士论文，取得了副博士学位，名利随之即来，升级很快，工资大大增加。有了一个副博士头衔，每月就可多得一百七十卢布，再加上其他职务所带来的附加收入，工资就更不少了。
    在苏联，同样的工作，有毕业证书的人的工资比没有毕业证书的人要高。在学校里，考试成绩好的人，可以享受较高的助学金。因此，“分数”和“文凭”就成为苏联大学生头等关心的事。
    在高等学校里，考试时的作弊现象是普遍而公开的，简直达到了惊人的程度。有时甚至共青团组织也来帮助同学作弊。他们这样公开作弊的论据是：如果某同学考试成绩不好，就会得不到助学金。
