In the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, people of the world revolution condemned the Soviet revisionist traitors, while U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist traitors colluded more closely.

U.S. President Johnson sent a special congratulatory telegram to Soviet revisionist leader Podgorny on November 7, expressing his "best wishes." In the telegram, Johnson openly declared that the U.S. and the Soviet Union should strengthen their counter-revolutionary global collusion and "jointly strive to achieve stability and lasting peace in the world."

It is particularly noteworthy that U.S. Secretary of State Rusk attended a reception held by the Soviet revisionist group's embassy in Washington on November 7 under the pretext of "commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution." According to Western news agencies, Rusk was the first to attend such a reception. The staff of the Soviet revisionist embassy were "obviously pleased" with Rusk's attendance. The Soviet revisionist ambassador to the U.S., Dobrynin, fawned over Rusk, welcoming him warmly and clinking glasses with him. Rusk also told reporters that the U.S. and the Soviet Union would continue to "coexist peacefully."

At the same time, in Moscow, U.S. Ambassador Thompson also attended a gathering held by the Soviet revisionist group on Red Square. When the Soviet revisionist group's defense minister once again played the trick of false support and true betrayal on the Vietnam issue, feigning condemnation of the United States, Thompson understood the implication and did not leave the scene. That day, Thompson also attended a reception held by the Soviet revisionist group, raising a toast to the "happiness" of the Soviet revisionist group.

The Soviet revisionist traitors, who have fallen into a miserable plight under the strong condemnation of the people of the world revolution, were greatly flattered by this unusually "affectionate" display from U.S. imperialism. According to Western news agencies, a staff member of the Soviet revisionist embassy in the U.S. could not help but exclaim, "How wonderful it is to have the U.S. Secretary of State with us tonight." This brief remark fully exposed the filthy soul of these traitors of the October Revolution and the servile face of these accomplices of U.S. imperialism.

    美帝苏修打得火热加紧反革命勾结
    约翰逊专门拍贺电向苏修头子表示“最好的祝愿”
    腊斯克出席招待会苏大使受宠若惊赶忙“热烈欢迎”
    新华社十二日讯　在十月革命五十周年的时候，全世界革命人民纷纷愤怒声讨苏修叛徒集团，而美帝国主义同苏修叛徒集团却特别打得火热。
    美帝头子约翰逊在七日专门给苏修头目波德戈尔内打去了贺电，表示“最好的祝愿”。约翰逊在电报里公开叫嚷，美苏要加强反革命全球勾结，“共同努力来使全世界实现稳定和持久和平”。
    十分引人注目的是，美国国务卿腊斯克在七日特地参加了苏修集团驻华盛顿大使馆盗用“纪念十月革命五十周年”名义而举行的招待会。据西方通讯社报道，腊斯克是第一次参加这样的招待会，苏修大使馆人员“对腊斯克的出席显然感到高兴”，苏修驻美大使多勃雷宁奴颜婢膝地出来“热烈欢迎”腊斯克，同他碰杯。腊斯克也对记者表示：美苏今后仍将“和平共处”。
    与此同时，在莫斯科，美国大使汤普逊七日也特地参加了苏修集团在红场举行的集会。当苏修集团国防部长在越南问题上再次玩弄假支持、真出卖的手法，假惺惺地谴责美国的时候，汤普逊心领神会，并没有因此而退场。当天，汤普逊又参加了苏修集团的招待会，为苏修集团的“幸福”举杯。
    在世界革命人民强烈谴责下陷入凄凉困境的苏修叛徒集团，对于美帝国主义这番异常“亲热”的表示，很是受宠若惊。据西方通讯社报道，苏修驻美大使馆的一个人员竟然情不自禁地高呼起来：“今晚有（美国）国务卿同我们在一起，是多么美好呀”。短短一语，把苏修集团这伙十月革命的叛徒的龌龊灵魂、这伙美帝帮凶的奴才嘴脸，暴露无遗。
