Members of the Qinghai Sixth Motor Transport Depot Revolutionary Committee adhere to the mass line, establishing a new type of relationship between cadres and the masses, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining: Members of the Qinghai Province Sixth Motor Transport Depot Revolutionary Committee firmly remember the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, placing themselves among the masses, uniting with the masses, discussing matters with the masses, and being students of the masses. The relationship between cadres and the masses throughout the depot is closer than ever, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent.

Members of this depot's revolutionary committee deeply understand that they are representatives elected by the masses and servants of the people. They must "serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses." They are determined to carry forward the Party's fine tradition of closely connecting with the masses and humbly learn from the masses. They also, together with the masses, specifically criticized the old leadership style and all tendencies of privilege.

Members of this depot's revolutionary committee follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "be both an official and a common person." They insist on participating in collective production labor. Besides doing their work well, those who were originally drivers still drive trucks, and those who were originally car repairmen still do repairs. They study Chairman Mao's works with the worker masses, work shifts together, and go wherever there are difficulties.

Members of the revolutionary committee leadership pay great attention to maintaining a frugal and plain lifestyle. Someone suggested setting up the revolutionary committee's duty room on the upper floor with better equipment, but they chose the lower floor with simpler equipment but more convenient for connecting with the masses. The duty room has only two old desks and a few old chairs. When holding committee meetings, if there aren't enough chairs, some comrades sit on the floor. They believe that this eliminates the bad habit of bourgeois ostentation and showiness, and gains the fine tradition of frugality and connecting with the masses. All members of the revolutionary committee, regardless of their positions, do not have their own separate offices. They work in the same room with everyone else, sweep the floor, and fetch water themselves. When they need to go out for work, they do not ride in cars. Someone suggested allocating a bicycle from the depot for the revolutionary committee members to use for official business, but they firmly rejected it. The worker masses see them setting an example in everything, working and laboring, and are really too tired, and they all concernedly tell the revolutionary committee members: You just need to handle the upper-level work well! The revolutionary committee members explain: Being aloof, acting like a lord, and giving orders is the style of the bourgeoisie. We are servants elected by the worker masses, serving the proletariat in power, and we cannot be separated from the masses for a moment!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All practical problems in the life of the masses are problems that we should pay attention to." Members of the revolutionary committee follow this teaching of Chairman Mao, paying attention to the political and ideological as well as the minutiae of life of the masses. They use their rest time to visit worker dormitories and various families. When someone is sick, they personally send them to the hospital. They check door-to-door to see whose house needs repairing, and quietly send people to fix it; whose house has difficulty pulling coal, they help deliver the coal; whose family has difficulties in life, they help in every way possible. When someone has unresolved ideological problems, they study Chairman Mao's works with them, patiently helping them over and over again.

In terms of work methods, the revolutionary committee adopts a system where members take turns being on duty, handling daily work, to ensure that all members can go deep among the masses and participate in labor. Duty personnel, when handling daily work, often invite relevant revolutionary cadres and revolutionary masses to participate, listen to their opinions, thus making the problems solved more appropriately and reasonably.

The revolutionary committee also established a system of "opinion solicitation day" every week, through holding symposiums, discussion meetings, heart-to-heart talks, and other forms, widely listening to the masses' criticisms and suggestions of the revolutionary committee. They insist on doing this and have achieved three benefits: First, revolutionary committee members are always under the supervision of the masses and do not leave the masses; second, they constantly and universally absorb the good suggestions of the broad revolutionary masses, concentrating and giving play to the wisdom of the revolutionary masses; third, they continuously deepen the mutual understanding between cadres and the masses, strengthen the relationship between cadres and the masses, and enhance unity.

    密切联系群众做人民忠实的勤务员
    青海第六汽车场革命委员会成员坚持群众路线，建立新型的干部和群众的关系，革命和生产形势大好
    据新华社西宁电　青海省第六汽车场革命委员会成员，牢牢记住伟大领袖毛主席的教导，把自己置于群众之中，和群众打成一片，遇事和群众商量，做群众的小学生，全场干群关系空前密切，革命和生产出现一派大好形势。
    这个场的革委会成员深刻地认识到：自己是群众选出来的代表，是人民的勤务员，必须“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。他们决心发扬我党密切联系群众的优良传统，虚心向群众学习。他们还和群众一起，专门批判了旧的领导作风和一切特殊化的倾向。
    这个场的革委会成员遵照毛主席“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”的教导，坚持参加集体生产劳动。他们除做好工作外，原来是驾驶员的还和以往一样开汽车，原来是汽车修理工的还搞修理。他们和工人群众一起学习毛主席著作，一起顶班劳动，而且那里有困难就到那里去。
    革委会领导成员十分注意保持艰苦朴素的作风。有人建议把革委会值班室设在设备比较好的楼上，他们偏偏选择在设备简陋但便于联系群众的楼下。值班室里只有两张旧桌子和几把旧椅子。开委员会时椅子不够用，有的同志就坐在地上。他们认为，这样去掉的是资产阶级摆阔气、讲排场的恶劣习气，得到的是艰苦朴素、联系群众的优良作风。所有革委会成员不论担任什么职务，都没有自己的专门办公室。他们和大家在一个屋子里工作，扫地、打开水一律自己动手。他们工作需要外出时，都不坐小汽车。有的同志提出把场里的自行车拨出一辆专供革委会成员因公外出时使用，他们也坚决拒绝了。工人群众看到他们处处以身作则，既做工作又参加劳动，实在太辛苦，都关心地对革委会的同志说：你们只要把上头的工作抓好就行，生产上我们顶住！革委会的同志们解释说：高高在上，做官当老爷，指手划脚，是资产阶级的作风。我们是工人群众选出来的勤务员，是为无产阶级掌权的，一刻也不能离开群众啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“一切群众的实际生活问题，都是我们应当注意的问题。”革委会成员遵循毛主席的这一教导，从政治思想到生活细事，都时刻注意关心群众。他们利用休息时间，到工人宿舍和各个家庭去访问。有的同志病了，他们亲自送到医院。他们挨家挨户地检查，看谁家的房子该修了，就不声不响地派人把房子修好；谁家拉煤有困难了，就帮助把煤送去；谁家生活有困难了，就尽一切办法给以帮助。有的同志思想问题解不开时，他们和他一起学习毛主席著作，一次又一次地耐心帮助。
    在工作方法上，采取革委会成员轮流值班制，处理日常工作，以保证全体成员可以深入群众和参加劳动。值班人员在处理日常工作时，经常吸收有关的革命干部和革命群众参加，听取他们的意见，这样使问题解决得更恰当，更合理。
    革委会还建立了每周一次“征求意见日”的制度，通过召开座谈会、讨论会、交心会等各种形式，广泛听取群众对革委会的批评和建议。他们坚持这样做的结果，收到了三方面的好处：一、革委会成员经常置于群众的监督之下，不脱离群众；二、经常地、普遍地吸收广大革命群众的好建议，集中和发挥了革命群众的聪明才智；三、不断加深干群之间的相互了解，密切了干部和群众的关系，增强了团结。
