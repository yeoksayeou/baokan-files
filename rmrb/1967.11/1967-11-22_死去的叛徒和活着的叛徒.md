Title: The Dead Traitor and the Living Traitor

"In the end, the most important thing is... oneself!" This is the inner monologue of the dead traitor Krayev from the novel "One Man's Fate," and it is also the guiding principle of the living traitor Sokolov.

Krayev, to "preserve himself," did not hesitate to betray his own platoon leader. This, of course, is despicable. But the platoon leader, facing this traitor, begged pitifully: "Don't betray me, Comrade Krayev." Calling the traitor a comrade and pleading with the traitor, the person pleading is as despicable as the traitor. At this moment, Sokolov, dressed up as a "hero" by Sholokhov, appeared. He, along with the platoon leader, according to Krayev's principle: "In the end, the most important thing is... oneself," strangled Krayev to death.

After strangling Krayev to death, Sokolov "preserved" "himself" and survived. How did he live on?

To save his life, he could "bear burdens," doing hard labor in the German concentration camp, carrying large stones.

To save his life, he could "endure humiliation," the enemy's lieutenant colonel compared him to a dog, and he could say: "Absolutely right."

Sokolov is the kind of person who survives under the enemy's gun by using principles as bargaining chips, living a life of shame and disgrace. Isn't this a genuine traitor?!

Sokolov and Krayev are both traitors. The difference is: one pretends to be righteous, one is shameless; one is alive, one is dead.

Sholokhov, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, and the like, are just like Sokolov, they are merely a group of living traitors!

    死去的叛徒和活着的叛徒
    上海无线电七厂　魏文龙
    “人最要紧的……还是自己！”这是《一个人的遭遇》中死去的叛徒克雷日涅夫的内心独白，实际上也是活着的叛徒索科洛夫的座右铭。
    克雷日涅夫为了“保存自己”，不惜出卖自己的排长，这当然可耻。而排长面对着这个叛徒竟然苦苦哀求：“你别出卖我吧，克雷日涅夫同志。”把叛徒称为同志，向叛徒求情的人，跟叛徒一样可耻。就在这时，被肖洛霍夫打扮成“英雄”的索科洛夫出现了，他跟排长一起，根据克雷日涅夫的原则：“人最要紧的……还是自己”，把克雷日涅夫掐死了。
    把克雷日涅夫掐死以后，索科洛夫“保存”了“自己”，活下来了。他又是怎样活着的呢？
    为了活命，他能“负重”，在德寇的集中营里干苦工，他拣大的石头搬。
    为了活命，他会“忍辱”，敌军少校把他比作狗，他可以说：“一点不错。”
    索科洛夫就是这样在敌人的枪口下拿原则当交易，苟且偷生地活下来的，这难道不是一个地地道道的叛徒吗？！
    索科洛夫和克雷日涅夫，都是叛徒。区别在于：一个装腔作势，一个毫无遮盖；一个活着，一个死去。
    肖洛霍夫、赫鲁晓夫、勃列日涅夫之流，跟索科洛夫一样，也不过是一群活着的叛徒而已！
