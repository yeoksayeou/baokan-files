The golden sun rises in the east,
Its rays shining brightly, ...

Chairman Mao, radiant and full of vigor, strides confidently into the Great Hall of the People with his close comrade Vice Chairman Lin Biao and other leaders. The hall is instantly filled with brightness, and the atmosphere is electric with cheers:

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Representatives from the Beijing Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, representatives from the Beijing Military Region Air Force's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works, comrades from the entire meeting of the Communist Party of China Air Force Committee, and comrades who participated in receiving revolutionary masses during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, together wave their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong," their hearts beating for our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

"Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!"

Chairman Mao waves back to the comrades. This is the greatest care, trust, encouragement, and exhortation from our great commander-in-chief to all the soldiers and officers of the entire army!

Living in the era of Mao Zedong is our greatest happiness. Every minute and second of the great teacher who toils for the Chinese and world revolutions, Chairman Mao, has seen us. This is our greatest happiness!

How many people shed tears of joy! How many people recorded this unforgettable moment in their copies of the Quotations! Even with a thousand words and ten thousand words, it is difficult to express our boundless love for the great teacher, great leader, great commander-in-chief, and great helmsman, Chairman Mao. All words and phrases converge into one sentence: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We sincerely wish you, dear Chairman, a long life! A long, long life!

Chairman Mao, we miss you every moment!

"The party's favor is greater than the heavens and the earth,
Parents' love is not as dear as Chairman Mao's care, ..."

Under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, comrades from various battlefronts such as the coastal and border defenses, "Three Supports, Two Militaries," and others, as they rushed to the center of the world revolution, Beijing, how many relatives and comrades tightly held their hands, repeatedly urging them to convey their best wishes for Chairman Mao's health. The entire company of the 11th Company of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region sewed for three days and nights to complete a red banner reading "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life," entrusting the representative to present it to the great leader, Chairman Mao. In the Shizigou Brigade, Beijing Air Force comrade Ma Linhua, who was supporting agriculture, was sent off to Beijing by the poor and lower-middle peasants to the threshing ground, who held his hand and said, "When you see Chairman Mao in Beijing, don't forget to tell him that the poor and lower-middle peasants think of him day and night. We will definitely follow the path he points out!"

At six o'clock in the afternoon of November 13th, the most anticipated and happiest moment finally arrived. Comrades, with the most excited hearts, received the reception from our most beloved great leader, Chairman Mao. The most ardent wish of many years finally came true.

This is a night of joy, a night of happiness, a night of excitement! People are overjoyed, and the drums and gongs resound in the garrison. One joyous team after another, one resolution after another. The joyous news is immediately transmitted to various places by telegram and telephone. Representatives of the Beijing Military Region's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works wrote articles and poems to express their boundless excitement and joy. The presidium of the Beijing Air Force's Conference of Active Learners of Chairman Mao's Works immediately wrote a letter of respect to the great leader, Chairman Mao, and used urgent telegrams to convey this great news to their subordinate units. The representatives held all-night discussions and held celebration meetings. Red banners filled the courtyard. Comrades participating in the Air Force Party Committee meeting also held all-night discussions, and the joyous passion stirred everyone. They said: "The situation in the country is excellent, the situation in the world is excellent, Chairman Mao is in extremely good health, and his energy is extremely abundant. This is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the revolutionary people of the whole world!"

Chairman Mao, our victory is all thanks to you!

"The ship sails on the sea guided by the helmsman,
All things grow under the sun, ..."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Following you is victory, thinking of you gives us strength. Two active learners of Chairman Mao's works, upon seeing Chairman Mao, wrote excitedly: Chairman Mao! You are the lighthouse of revolution, the savior of mankind. With you, "Awaken thousands and tens of thousands of workers and peasants, unite to work"; with you, "The Red Army is not afraid of the difficulties of the long march, ten thousand waters and a thousand mountains are mere trifles"; with you, "The tiger crouches and the dragon coils, today is better than yesterday, the world is turned upside down and the times are stirring"; with you, "The seas roar and the clouds surge, the five continents shake with thunder and lightning."

In Tianjin Yanan Middle School, where certain regiment deputy political commissar Qiao Xizeng was responsible for military training, he recounted his excited feelings upon seeing Chairman Mao with tears of joy. He said: "Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Every achievement of ours is due to your guidance, and every step forward we take is inseparable from your brilliant thoughts. According to your teachings, we helped revolutionary teachers and students achieve revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes. As soon as this new thing appeared, you gave it full affirmation and support. It is you who pointed out the direction for us, and it is you who led us from victory to victory. Ten thousand victories, a hundred thousand victories, forever following you is the greatest victory!"

The commander of the unit where Du Fengrui, who was awarded the collective first-class merit, served, Chen Qingluan, said: It was Chairman Mao who nurtured heroes like Du Fengrui for us, setting an example for us. It was Chairman Mao who saved me, a poor child from the old society, from the sea of suffering. It was Chairman Mao who gave me wings of steel. When I first flew into the sky of my motherland, thinking of you, old man, I was so moved that I shed tears. Today, seeing you with my own eyes, how can I not shout and sing! We deeply feel that: "Flying relies on the compass to point the direction, doing revolution relies on your thoughts to navigate."

Huang Xiancai, a staff officer of the Chengde Municipal Military Sub-district, excitedly said: "On the battlefield in Korea, seven days and nights without food, without sleep, thinking of Chairman Mao gave me energy; in winter, swimming across a great river, water up to the neck, ice shards piercing the skin, thinking of Chairman Mao, the cold was nothing; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, when the wild horse startled the car and rushed towards the Red Guards, thinking of Chairman Mao, I dared to step forward. Fish cannot live without water, melons cannot live without vines. We do revolution entirely relying on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought."

Chairman Mao, we vow to defend you!

"Mao Zedong Thought is the treasure of revolution,
Whoever opposes it is our enemy."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your revolutionary line is the lifeline of revolutionary people; your brilliant thoughts are the guarantee of the victory of the world revolution; you are the reddest red sun in our hearts. Defending you, defending your line, defending your thoughts, is defending the highest and greatest fundamental interests of the revolutionary people of the world, this is the most glorious and sacred combat mission of every revolutionary soldier.

From the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, An Yurong, a female militia member of the North China Metal Structure Factory, saw Chairman Mao and could not contain her joy and excitement. In the early days of the Cultural Revolution, she posted the first big-character poster attacking the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, was besieged, and was labeled a "monster and demon." The persecution by the bourgeois reactionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev did not shake her loyalty to Chairman Mao. She firmly said: "If I live, I will fight for the implementation of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; if I die, I will dedicate myself to defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!"

Wang Jianping, a female performer of the Inner Mongolia Military Region Cultural Troupe, was cruelly persecuted by the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party during the Cultural Revolution. But she vowed not to yield in order to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. When the capitalist-roaders in the Party beat her, she always faced east and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Later, she finally, together with the vast revolutionary masses, pulled down the capitalist-roaders in the Party in the Inner Mongolia region, and the unsetting sun rose over the grasslands. Today, her long-cherished wish has been realized, and she has seen the great leader, Chairman Mao. She said with tears of joy: "I am an art warrior. I will study Chairman Mao's works for life, propagate Mao Zedong Thought for life, defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line for life, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted all over China and spread all over the world."

Chen Jinliang, the political instructor of the 5th Company, which has been awarded the title of "Four Good" Company for six consecutive years, was so excited after seeing Chairman Mao that he could not sleep all night. When the agents of the Chinese Khrushchev, Peng Dehuai, and Luo Ruiqing implemented the bourgeois military line, he and his comrades studied the resolutions of the Gutian Meeting and the expanded meeting of the Military Commission over and over again, and swore under the red flag stained with the blood of martyrs: "Even if the sky falls and the earth collapses, our will to defend Chairman Mao's military line will not waver; even if our bodies are crushed, our red hearts for Mao Zedong Thought will never change." Today, Chen Jinliang said with great excitement: "With the support of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the delusions of the Chinese Khrushchev are doomed to fail, just like the ant shaking a big tree."

Chairman Mao, we will forever follow you!

"Ten thousand years, ten thousand years to Chairman Mao,
Your words are in our hearts."

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We promise to be forever loyal to you, we are determined to forever follow you, and along the revolutionary course you have blazed, we will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end and stride towards communism!

What a restless night it was! Everyone made plans and expressed their determination, using the deepest class feelings and the most vivid language to express their sincere loyalty to Chairman Mao: We must turn the warm concern of the great leader Mao Zedong into a great driving force, advance victoriously, and specially promote the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. We vow to be the vanguard of fighting selfishness and the pioneers of criticizing revisionism, and to achieve new victories in the Cultural Revolution.

Xu Henglu, deputy commander of a certain regiment and a combat hero, saw our most beloved great leader Mao Zedong for the first time on the evening of September 30, 1951, in the Great Hall of the People. For sixteen years, he has followed Chairman Mao, advancing through the great winds and waves of class struggle. Today, under the decisive victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Xu Henglu came to Beijing from the front line of supporting the left, and received Chairman Mao's reception. He said excitedly: "Dear Chairman Mao, every time I see you, it is the greatest encouragement for me, giving me the impetus to advance. I will definitely remember your teachings, not to rest on my laurels, to achieve new victories, to be humble and modest, to fight selfishness for life, to criticize revisionism for life, and to revolutionize for life!"

Bai Zongshan, who participated in the Air Force Party Committee meeting, is a revolutionary old soldier who has followed Chairman Mao in battles north and south for thirty years. In the revolutionary war years, he made achievements for the people; in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he again, according to Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly supported the revolutionary leftists and made new achievements for the people. He said: "Chairman Mao teaches us: 'It is not difficult for a person to do a good deed, but it is difficult to do good deeds all one's life, not to do bad deeds, and to be beneficial to the broad masses all one's life.' I will definitely remember Chairman Mao's teachings, fight selfishness, criticize revisionism, maintain my integrity until the end, revolutionize to the end, and dedicate everything I have to make the whole world a new world of red Mao Zedong Thought."

The militia instructor of the Dazhai Brigade, the "Iron Girl" Guo Fenglian, saw Chairman Mao and immediately reported the joyous news to the people of Dazhai by telephone that night. She said: "We people of Dazhai read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, walk the path Chairman Mao points out, and rely on Mao Zedong Thought to start. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We must learn and use it for this generation, and our descendants must learn and use it forever. The capitalist-roaders in the Party want to uproot the red flag that Chairman Mao personally raised in Dazhai, but they can't, they will never be able to! We are determined to make Dazhai a great school of Mao Zedong Thought and make all of China a more solid world revolutionary base."

"Dear Chairman Mao,
The red sun in our hearts!
We have so many heartfelt words to tell you,
We have so many passionate songs to sing to you!"

The blue sky as paper, cannot write down our boundless love and admiration for you,
The vast sea as ink, cannot write down our boundless faith and loyalty to you.

Thousands of resolutions, ten thousand resolutions, into one resolution, we must, as Vice Chairman Lin instructed, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao!

    颗颗红心向着红太阳
    “金色的太阳升起在东方，
    光芒万丈，……”
    毛主席容光焕发，神采奕奕，迈着矫健的步伐，和他的亲密战友林彪副主席以及其他领导同志，来到了人民大会堂接见大厅。
    顿时，大厅里显得格外明亮，全场沸腾，欢声雷动：
    “毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    出席北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表、北京部队空军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表、中国共产党空军委员会全体会议的同志，和在无产阶级文化大革命中参加接待革命群众工作的同志一起，挥舞着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，颗颗红心向着我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    “毛主席万岁！毛主席万万岁！”
    毛主席频频向同志们挥手。这是我们伟大统帅对全军指战员的最大关怀、最大信任、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策！
    生活在毛泽东时代，是我们最大的幸福。每一分钟、每一秒钟都在为中国革命和世界革命操劳的伟大导师毛主席，接见了我们，这更是我们最大最大的幸福！
    多少人洒下了幸福的泪花！多少人在语录本上记下了这终生难忘的时刻！纵有千言万语也难表达出我们对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的无限热爱。万语千言，汇成一句话：毛主席啊，毛主席！我们最最衷心地敬祝您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，我们时刻想念您！
    “天大地大不如党的恩情大，
    爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲，……”
    在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，来自祖国海防、边防、“三支”、“两军”等各个战斗岗位上的同志们，在奔向世界革命的中心北京的时候，有多少亲人，多少战友，紧紧地握住他们的双手，千叮咛，万嘱咐，要他们代为敬祝毛主席身体健康。北京部队某部十一连全体指战员，飞针走线，赶了三天三夜，绣成了“敬祝毛主席万寿无疆”的一面红旗，委托代表献给伟大领袖毛主席。在师子沟大队支农的北京空军某部马林华，动身来北京时，贫下中农把他送到打谷场上，拉着他的手说：“到北京见了毛主席，可别忘了告诉他老人家，说贫下中农日夜想念毛主席。他指引的道路俺们走定了！”
    十一月十三日下午六时，日盼夜想的最最幸福的时刻终于来到了。同志们怀着最最激动的心情，接受了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的接见。多少年来最最热切的心愿，终于实现了。
    这是欢乐的一夜，幸福的一夜，沸腾的一夜！人们欢欣若狂，驻地锣鼓喧天，报喜队一个接着一个，决心书一张接着一张。幸福的喜讯，通过电报电话，立即传到各地。北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的代表们，纷纷写稿、作诗，表达自己无限兴奋、喜悦的心情。北京空军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会主席团回到驻地，立即向伟大领袖毛主席写致敬信，并用急电向所属部队传达这个大喜讯。代表们连夜座谈，开庆祝大会，大红大红的标语，贴满了院子。参加空军党委全会的同志，也连夜座谈，幸福的激情，激动着每一个人。他们说：“全国形势大好，世界形势大好，毛主席身体非常非常健康，精力非常非常充沛，这是全国人民全世界革命人民的最大幸福！”
    毛主席啊，我们的胜利全靠您！
    “大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，……”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！跟着您，就是胜利，想到您，就有力量。两位学习毛主席著作积极分子见到毛主席，激动地写道：毛主席啊！您是革命的灯塔，人类的救星。有了您，“唤起工农千百万，同心干”；有了您，“红军不怕远征难，万水千山只等闲”；有了您，“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷”；有了您，“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激”。
    在天津延安中学担任军训任务的某团副政委乔喜增含着幸福的泪水，叙述他见到毛主席的激动心情。他说：“毛主席啊，毛主席！我们每一点成绩，都是由于您的教导，我们每前进一步，都离不开您的光辉思想。我们按照您的教导，帮助革命师生实现了以教学班为基础的革命大联合。这个新生事物一出现，您就给予了充分的肯定和支持。是您给我们指明了方向，是您引导我们从胜利走向胜利。千胜利，万胜利，永远紧跟着您，就是最大的胜利！”
    荣获集体一等功的空军某部杜凤瑞生前所在中队中队长陈庆銮说：是毛主席哺育出来了杜凤瑞这样的英雄，为我们树立了榜样。是毛主席把我这个徒工出身的苦孩子，从旧社会的苦海里解救出来。是毛主席给我插上了钢铁的翅膀。当我第一次飞上祖国的天空，想起您老人家，激动得流下了眼泪。今天，亲眼见到了您，怎能不叫我欢呼歌唱！我们深深体会到：“飞行靠罗盘指方向，干革命靠您的思想导航。”
    承德市武装部参谋黄显才激动地说：“在朝鲜战场上，七天七夜吃不上饭，睡不成觉，一想起毛主席就浑身是劲；冬天泅渡大江，水漫脖颈，冰碴刺骨，一想起毛主席，再冷也不在话下；在无产阶级文化大革命中，当烈马惊车冲向红卫兵小将的时候，一想起毛主席，我就敢挺身而出。鱼儿离不开水，瓜儿离不开秧。我们干革命全靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。”
    毛主席啊，我们誓死保卫您！
    “毛泽东思想是革命的宝，
    谁要是反对它谁就是我们的敌人。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您的革命路线，是革命人民的命根子；您的光辉思想，是世界革命胜利的保障；您是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。保卫您，保卫您的路线，保卫您的思想，就是保卫世界革命人民最高最大的根本利益，这是我们每个革命战士最光荣最神圣的战斗任务。
    从资产阶级反动路线白色恐怖中，冲杀出来的华北金属结构厂的女民兵安玉荣，见到毛主席，抑制不住内心的喜悦和激动。在文化大革命初期，她贴出了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火的第一张大字报，受到了围攻，被打成“牛鬼蛇神”。中国赫鲁晓夫的资产阶级反动路线对她的迫害，丝毫没有动摇她忠于毛主席的红心。她坚定地说：“生，我要为执行毛主席的革命路线而战斗；死，我要为保卫毛主席的革命路线而献身！”
    内蒙古军区文工团女演员王建萍，在文化大革命中，受到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的残酷迫害。但她为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，誓死不屈服。当党内走资派殴打她的时候，她始终面向东方，高呼毛主席万岁！后来，终于同广大革命群众一起，把内蒙古地区的党内走资派拉下了马，草原上升起了不落的太阳。今天，她多年的愿望实现了，见到了伟大领袖毛主席。她含着热泪说：“我是一个文艺战士，我决心要一辈子学习毛主席著作，一辈子宣传毛泽东思想，一辈子保卫毛主席的革命路线，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国，红遍全世界。”
    连续六年荣获四好连队称号的某部五连指导员陈金良，见到毛主席以后，激动得彻夜难眠。中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿推行资产阶级军事路线时，他和战友们一遍又一遍地学习古田会议决议和军委扩大会议决议，在烈士鲜血染红的红旗下宣誓：“天塌地陷，保卫毛主席军事路线的意志不动摇；粉身碎骨，忠于毛泽东思想的红心永不变。”今天，陈金良无比激动地说：“有亿万革命群众和解放军战士忠心保卫毛主席的革命路线，中国赫鲁晓夫的痴心妄想，只能是蚍蜉撼大树，注定要失败的。”
    毛主席啊，我们永远跟着您！
    “万岁万岁毛主席吔，
    您的话儿记在我们的心坎里。”
    毛主席啊，毛主席！我们保证永远忠于您，我们决心永远跟着您，沿着您开辟的革命航道，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，向着共产主义阔步前进！
    这是多么不平静的一夜啊！大家纷纷订计划，表决心，以最深厚的阶级感情，最生动的语言，表达他们永远紧跟毛主席的赤胆忠心：一定要把伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀，化为巨大的动力，乘胜前进，大树特树毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，誓做斗私的先锋，批修的闯将，在文化大革命中立新功。
    某团副团长、战斗英雄徐恒禄，一九五一年九月三十日晚上，在怀仁堂第一次见到了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席。十六年来，他紧跟毛主席，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，不断前进。今天，在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，徐恒禄从支左斗争第一线又来到北京，接受了毛主席的接见。他激动地说：“敬爱的毛主席啊，每一次见到您，都是对我最大的鞭策，给了我前进的动力。我一定牢记您的教导，不吃老本，要立新功，戒骄戒躁，斗一辈子私，批一辈子修，干一辈子革命！”
    参加空军党委全会的白宗善，是跟着毛主席南征北战三十年的革命老战士。在革命战争年代，他为人民立下战功；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他又遵照毛主席的教导，坚定地支持革命左派，为人民立了新功。他说：“毛主席教导我们：‘一个人做点好事并不难，难的是一辈子做好事，不做坏事，一贯的有益于广大群众’，我一定牢记毛主席的教导，斗私批修，保持晚节，革命到底，为把全世界变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想新世界献出我的一切。”
    大寨大队的民兵指导员“铁姑娘”郭凤莲见到了毛主席，连夜打电话向大寨人报告大喜讯。她说：“我们大寨人，读的是毛主席的书，听的是毛主席的话，走的是毛主席指引的路，靠的是毛泽东思想起家。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们这一代要学要用，子孙万代永远要学，永远要用。党内走资派，妄图拔掉大寨这面毛主席亲自树起来的红旗，他们办不到，永远办不到！我们决心把大寨办成毛泽东思想大学校，把全中国办成更加巩固的世界革命根据地。”
    “敬爱的毛主席，
    我们心中的红太阳！
    我们有多少贴心的话儿要对您讲，
    我们有多少热情的歌儿要对您唱！”
    蓝天当纸，写不尽我们对您的无限热爱，无限崇拜！
    大海做墨，写不完我们对您的无限信仰，无限忠诚！
    千条决心，万条决心，并成一条决心，我们一定要象林副主席所指示的那样：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士！
