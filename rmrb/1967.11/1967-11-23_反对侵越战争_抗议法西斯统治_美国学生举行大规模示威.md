According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, four thousand students from San Jose State College in California, USA, held a massive protest on the 20th to oppose the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam and to protest against the fascist rule of the Johnson administration. The protesting students bravely fought against the fascist police who came to suppress them.

This protest was triggered by the Dow Chemical Company, which manufactures napalm for the Vietnam War, recruiting students on campus. That day at noon, the protesting students, chanting anti-war slogans and waving banners and flags, marched towards the administrative building of the college. They angrily demanded that the recruiters from Dow Chemical Company be expelled from the school. The protesting students also burned an American flag and a straw man with the faces of Johnson and the company's boss to express their anger against the Vietnam War.

The reactionary authorities dispatched 17 police cars and a large number of police officers who threw tear gas at the unarmed students. However, the protesting students, undeterred by the tear gas and police beatings, bravely fought back against the fascist police in a fierce struggle.

The images show students holding a dummy with three heads during the protest (left image), and then angrily burning it (right image). The largest head in the middle represents the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson, the head on the left represents the Dow Chemical Company, and the head on the right represents the reactionary military.

    反对侵越战争　抗议法西斯统治
    美国学生举行大规模示威
    据新华社二十一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国加利福尼亚州圣何塞学院的四千多名学生，二十日举行大规模示威，反对美国的侵越政策，抗议约翰逊政府的法西斯统治。示威学生同前来镇压的法西斯警察展开了英勇的搏斗。
    这次示威是因为专替侵越战争制造凝固汽油弹的道氏化学公司到这个学校去进行招募活动而引起的。这一天中午，示威学生高呼着反对侵越战争的口号，挥舞着标语和旗帜，列队向这个学院的行政大楼前进。他们愤怒地要求把道氏化学公司的招募人员赶出学校。示威学生还烧毁了一面美国星条旗和一个带着约翰逊和化学公司老板头像的草人，以表示他们对侵越战争的愤怒。
    反动当局出动了十七辆警车，派了大批警察向这些手无寸铁的学生投掷催泪瓦斯弹。但是示威学生不顾催泪弹的浓烟和警察的殴打，英勇地和法西斯警察展开了激烈的搏斗。（附图片）
