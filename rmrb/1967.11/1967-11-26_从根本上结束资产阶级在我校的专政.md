For seventeen years since the founding of the nation, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the educational circles, under the instigation and support of the Chinese Khrushchev, have strenuously maintained the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the schools. In essence, this is to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, to promote the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, to contend with the proletariat for the younger generation, and to achieve the restoration of capitalism.

The old Beijing Normal University was a typical example of bourgeois intellectuals ruling the schools.

The Chinese Khrushchev, as early as the initial years of liberation, advocated that those bourgeois intellectuals were "part of the working class," and advocated that bourgeois intellectuals continue to rule the schools. Lu Dingyi also slandered that the Party could not lead education, advocating "cooperation between the Communist Party and the Nationalists" in universities and implementing the "three-thirds system." According to these "instructions," our university implemented a complete "expert-led" leadership system. The academic affairs committee and departmental affairs committee, with bourgeois intellectuals as the main body, became the highest authority in the school, monopolizing the administrative, teaching, and scientific research powers of the school. In the academic affairs committee, the capitalist-roaders within the Party and bourgeois intellectuals accounted for the vast majority. The same was true for the departmental affairs committees. Some bourgeois intellectuals were also appointed as presidents, department heads, and heads of teaching and research sections. From teaching and scientific research to enrollment, graduation allocation, and even political and ideological work plans, all had to be discussed and decided by them. In this way, bourgeois intellectuals, in a legal form, seized the educational leadership power, forming the situation of "academics running the school" advocated by the bourgeois rightists in 1957.

The Chinese Khrushchev repeatedly advocated learning from bourgeois intellectuals. Lu Dingyi even shouted: "To cultivate proletarian intellectuals, we need to use bourgeois intellectuals. Even if rightists can be used, they should be used, even with hats on." With the support of the largest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, monsters and demons swarmed onto the podiums of our university. The notorious old rightist Dong Weichuan, in 1957, crazily advocated that "the academic committee composed of professors and associate professors should be the highest authority of the entire school, concentrating teaching power, personnel power, and financial power." Such a reactionary scoundrel actually returned to the podium. He used the opportunity of teaching to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, screaming hysterically, "A scholar can be killed but not humiliated." The dog-headed strategist of the "Zhang-Ruo Alliance," Huang Yaomian, also had his rightist hat removed and arrogantly returned to the podium. He used the pretext of lecturing on "The Palace of Eternal Life" to viciously attack the Great Leap Forward. External bourgeois anti-revolutionary academic "authorities" like Wu Han were also invited to our university to spread poison. The socialist podium became a stronghold for bourgeois anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought activities.

The largest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party also handed over the power to compile textbooks and conduct scientific research to bourgeois intellectuals. The counter-revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, in the 1961 conference on liberal arts textbooks, personally encouraged two bourgeois professors from our school. He said: "If you publish a book and someone criticizes it, I will take political responsibility, and you will take academic responsibility." After the meeting, he actually let several bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities" compile "History of Ancient Chinese Education" and let two rightists compile "Selected Works on Modern Chinese Education." The compilation rights of other textbooks were also in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals. The power of scientific research was also seized by them. The school explicitly stipulated: "The main force for our school to carry out scientific research is professors, associate professors, and lecturers," and "established an academic committee composed of several professors and associate professors with higher academic levels." In 1962, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party of our university even held a "scientific paper and monograph exhibition," extensively exhibiting various monographs and papers by bourgeois reactionary "authorities" and professors before and after liberation, luring young people to learn from them. The "Beijing Normal University Journal" extensively published articles by bourgeois intellectuals, even publishing the poisonous weeds of the notorious big rightist Tao Dazong who participated in the six-professor meeting in 1957. The form of compiling textbooks and conducting scientific research by combining cadres, teachers, and students, adopted during the educational revolution in 1958, was completely negated.

The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party of our university also feared that bourgeois intellectuals would have no successors, so they vigorously promoted "faculty training." They shouted, "We must go to the coffin to rescue the heritage," and carried out so-called "matching," assigning many bourgeois professors with young teachers as assistants, making young teachers and graduate students kneel down before bourgeois professors (some of whom are rightists). After obtaining the power to cultivate "successors," bourgeois intellectuals became even more arrogant. Some bourgeois professors "instructed" their disciples, saying: "Young people learning from old teachers must be infatuated, must follow every step," and "if you have a critical mind, you won't learn anything."

The small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party of our university and bourgeois intellectuals tightly colluded, usurping the Party and government powers of the school. They frantically opposed the revolutionary teachers and students in studying, applying, and using Chairman Mao's works, using every means to obstruct revolutionary teachers and students from participating in the three great revolutionary movements, cruelly suppressing, expelling, and persecuting worker-peasant students, and vigorously promoting the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line of the Chinese Khrushchev, implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the broad revolutionary teachers and students.

Our great leader Chairman Mao called on us: "Raise high the banner of the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly expose the bourgeois reactionary stance of those so-called 'academic authorities' who are anti-Party and anti-socialist, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary thoughts in the academic, educational, news, cultural, and publishing circles, and seize the leadership in these cultural fields." Over the past year, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defeating the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and bourgeois reactionary "academic authorities" to the point of complete disarray. The leadership of our university has finally been seized back by the proletarian revolutionaries. We must take "criticizing selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the guideline, further carry out the great criticism, do a good job in resuming classes and making revolution, and fundamentally end the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over the school.

    从根本上结束资产阶级在我校的专政
    北京师范大学革命委员会
    建国十七年来，教育界党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使和支持下，极力维护资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。归结到一点，这就是要反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，同无产阶级争夺青少年一代，实现资本主义复辟。
    旧北京师范大学就是资产阶级知识分子统治学校的典型之一。
    中国赫鲁晓夫早在解放初就宣扬那些资产阶级知识分子是“工人阶级的一部分”，主张让资产阶级知识分子继续统治学校。陆定一也诬蔑党不会领导教育，鼓吹在大学里和资产阶级知识分子搞“国共合作”，实行“三三制”。按照这些“指示”，师大实行了一整套“专家治校”的领导体制。以资产阶级知识分子为主体的校务委员会、系务委员会成了学校的最高权力机构，垄断了学校行政、教学和科研的大权。在校务委员中，党内走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级知识分子占绝大部分。各系系务委员会也是这样。一些资产阶级知识分子，还被任命为校长、系主任、教研室主任等。学校从教学、科学研究到招生、毕业分配等工作，甚至连政治思想工作计划，都要由他们讨论决定。这样，资产阶级知识分子就以合法的形式掌握了教育领导权，形成了一九五七年资产阶级右派主张的“教授治校”的局面。
    中国赫鲁晓夫多次鼓吹要向资产阶级知识分子“学习”。陆定一更叫嚷：“培养无产阶级知识分子，要用资产阶级知识分子，右派能利用还要利用，戴起帽子来利用。”在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，牛鬼蛇神纷纷登上师大的讲坛。臭名昭著的老右派董渭川，在一九五七年就疯狂地叫嚣要“由教授、副教授组成学术委员会作为全校最高权力机构，集中教权、人权、财权”。象这样的反动家伙，居然再度登上了讲台。他利用讲课机会猖狂地向党进攻，歇斯底里地叫喊“士可杀不可辱”。“章罗联盟”的狗头军师黄药眠，也被摘了右派的帽子，趾高气扬地登上了讲台。他以讲《阿房宫赋》为名，恶毒地攻击大跃进。校外的吴晗等资产阶级反动学术“权威”，也纷纷被请到师大来放毒。社会主义的讲坛，成了资产阶级反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的阵地。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，还把编写教材、科学研究等大权拱手交给资产阶级知识分子。反革命修正主义分子周扬，曾经在一九六一年文科教材会议上，亲自为我校两个资产阶级教授鼓气。他说：“你们编出书，要是有人批判，我负政治责任，你们负学术责任。”会议结束后，他竟然让几个资产阶级反动学术“权威”编《中国古代教育史》，让两个右派编《中国近代教育文选》。其他一些教材的编写权，也都掌握在资产阶级知识分子手里。科学研究的大权也被他们所掌握。学校明文规定：“我校开展科学研究的主要力量是教授、副教授、讲师”，“设立学术委员会，由学术水平较高的教授、副教授若干人组成”。一九六二年，师大党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还举办什么“科学论文专著展览会”，大量展出资产阶级的反动学术“权威”、教授解放前后的各种专著论文，引诱青年向他们学习。《师大学报》大量地发表资产阶级知识分子的文章，甚至登出了一九五七年参加臭名昭著的六教授会议的大右派陶大镛的毒草。一九五八年教育革命中所采用的干部、教师、学生三结合编写教材、搞科研的形式，完全被否定了。
    师大党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还惟恐资产阶级知识分子后继无人，于是大抓“师资培养”。他们叫喊“要到棺材里去抢救遗产”，搞所谓“对号入座”，给许多资产阶级教授配备了青年教师作助手，要青年教师、研究生拜倒在资产阶级教授（有的还是右派分子）脚下。资产阶级知识分子得到了培养“接班人”的权力后，更为嚣张。有的资产阶级教授就“教导”他的徒弟说：“青年人向老教师学习要迷，要亦步亦趋”，“有了批判的念头，就学不到东西了”。
    师大党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级知识分子紧紧勾结在一起，篡夺了学校的党、政大权。他们疯狂地反对革命师生活学活用毛主席著作，千方百计地阻挠革命师生参加三大革命运动，残酷地打击、排挤和迫害工农同学，极力推行中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命修正主义教育路线，对广大革命师生实行资产阶级专政。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席号召我们：“高举无产阶级文化革命的大旗，彻底揭露那批反党反社会主义的所谓‘学术权威’的资产阶级反动立场，彻底批判学术界、教育界、新闻界、文化界、出版界的资产阶级反动思想，夺取在这些文化领域中的领导权。”一年多来，广大革命师生高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动学术“权威”打得落花流水。师大的领导权也终于夺回到无产阶级革命派的手中了。我们一定要以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步地开展革命的大批判，搞好复课闹革命，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。
