Johnson's insatiable aggression in Vietnam
Delusional plans to expand the Vietnam War to achieve so-called "honorable peace"

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th, Washington: On the 17th, the head of American imperialism, Johnson, admitted at a press conference in the White House that, in the face of the disastrous defeat in the Vietnam War and the surging opposition to the war by the American people, his government, led by him, is facing increasingly fierce criticism from all sides at home. However, this American bandit leader still rants that the American invaders will continue to stay in South Vietnam and delusionally seeks to use the nearly 500,000 American invaders, who have been beaten into a sorry state, to force the Vietnamese people to surrender in what he calls "honorable peace."

	Johnson anxiously exclaimed that "confused thoughts" and "depressed moods" have emerged in the United States, and that "some of the things happening now are extremely dangerous for our national interests." He also admitted that this situation will continue and develop.

	He particularly raved and attacked the American people's struggle against the Vietnam War, calling it "Stormtrooper-style intimidation, shouting, and complete disregard for the law."

	Johnson made no secret of the fact that American imperialism will persist in its policy of aggression in Vietnam. He shouted, "We will fulfill our obligations in South Vietnam," and "The people we send there (referring to the American invaders) will bring us honorable peace." He also revealed that he had discussed in detail with Westmoreland, the head of the American troops recently returned from Vietnam, the issue of further sending troops to South Vietnam. According to reports, the Johnson administration, in an effort to salvage the failing Vietnam War, specially recalled Westmoreland and other high-ranking military and political officials executing the Vietnam policy, such as the American "ambassador" to the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Bunker, to Washington. They are currently plotting new measures to expand the Vietnam War.

	At the same time, although Johnson admitted that the American "peace talks" hoax has repeatedly failed under the stern condemnation of the Vietnamese people, he still expressed his intention to continue playing the "peace talks" trick, and even conspired to involve the United Nations in the Vietnam issue. He said, "We have tried several times to get the United Nations to play a role in achieving peace in Vietnam," and "We may try again."

	Johnson's remarks at this press conference once again show that the Vietnam War, which is becoming increasingly disastrous, has unprecedentedly intensified the difficulties and contradictions of American imperialism in domestic politics. While this American imperialist head is holding a secret meeting with his subordinates who are the heads of the Vietnam aggression, he comes out to publicly shout that he will persist in the Vietnam policy, which also shows that the aggressive American imperialism will never be willing to admit defeat.

	However, no matter what new measures the Johnson administration plots for the Vietnam War, or what new tricks they play in the "peace talks" hoax, they will absolutely not be able to stop the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against America and national salvation from achieving greater victories, nor will they be able to stop the surging tide of the American people's anti-war struggle. The desperate struggles of American imperialism can only lead it to its own doom more quickly.

    约翰逊侵略越南的贼心不死
    妄想以扩大侵越战争来取得所谓“体面的和平”
    据新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义头子约翰逊十七日在白宫的一次记者招待会上承认，在侵越战争惨败和美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争高涨的情况下，以他为首的美国政府正在国内受到来自各方面的越来越猛烈的抨击。但是，这个美国强盗头子仍然叫嚷美国侵略者要继续赖在南越，并且妄图依靠已被打得狼狈不堪的近五十万美国侵略军来寻求迫使越南人民投降的所谓“体面的和平”。
    约翰逊惶惶不安地惊呼，美国国内出现了“混乱思想”和“沮丧情绪”，“现在发生的一些事情对我们的国家利益来说是非常危险的”。他还承认，这种情况将会持续和发展下去。
    他特别疯狂地诬蔑和攻击美国人民反对侵越战争的斗争是什么“冲锋队员式的恐吓、吼叫和完全不顾法律”。
    约翰逊毫不掩饰，美帝国主义仍要坚持它的侵越政策。他叫嚷说，美国要“履行”它在南越的所谓“义务”，“派往那里的人员（指美国侵略军）将给我们带来体面的和平”。他还透露，他已经同最近回国的美国侵越军头目威斯特摩兰“比较详细地讨论了”美国继续向南越增兵的问题。据报道，约翰逊政府为了竭力挽救侵越战争败局，特地把威斯特摩兰和美国驻南越傀儡集团“大使”邦克等一些执行侵越政策的高级军政官员召回华盛顿，正在同他们策划扩大侵越战争的新措施。
    同时，尽管约翰逊承认，美国的“和谈”骗局已经在越南人民的严正谴责下一再遭到破产，但是他仍然表示要继续玩弄“和谈”花招，甚至仍然阴谋使联合国插手越南问题。他说，“我们曾几次试图让联合国在设法实现越南和平方面发挥作用”，“我们可能再试一试”。
    约翰逊在这次记者招待会上的谈话又一次表明，越败越惨的侵越战争，已经空前地加剧了美帝国主义在内政方面的困难和矛盾。而这个美帝头子在同他手下的侵越头目举行黑会的同时，又出来公开叫嚷要坚持侵越政策，也说明侵略成性的美帝国主义，决不会甘心认输。
    但是，约翰逊政府不论策划什么侵越战争的新措施，也不论玩弄什么“和谈”骗局的新花招，都绝对阻止不了越南人民抗美救国战争继续取得更大的胜利，也绝对阻止不了美国人民反侵越斗争浪潮继续蓬勃高涨。美帝国主义的垂死挣扎只能使它自己更快地走入覆灭的绝境。
