	Under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, the 22nd session of the United Nations General Assembly once again illegally discussed the "Korean question" and recently passed a resolution, openly continuing to support U.S. aggression against Korea and brutally interfering in Korean internal affairs.

	As in previous years, the United States once again rallied Japan, Thailand, the Philippines, and other countries to submit a proposal at the United Nations General Assembly. The proposal stipulates that the tool of U.S. interference in Korean internal affairs, the "United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea," should continue to "intensify efforts" to seek, under the condition of U.S. aggression forces armed occupation of South Korea, to achieve "unification" in Korea through "free elections" arranged by the United States. The proposal also stipulates that as long as the conditions for a "durable solution" formulated by the United States-controlled United Nations have not been realized, the U.S. aggression forces, under the banner of the "United Nations Forces," will continue to occupy South Korea for a long time.

	Despite strong opposition from Albania and many Asian and African countries, the United States, with the support of the majority in the United Nations, passed its proposal.

	The Soviet revisionist representative also submitted a proposal at the General Assembly, hypocritically expressing support for the Korean people. However, after Albania proposed an amendment, clearly pointing out that the United Nations organization has no right to discuss the "Korean question," the Soviet revisionists refused the Albanian amendment. This fully exposed the Soviet revisionist group's despicable tactic of false support and true betrayal on the "Korean question" and their true face of colluding with U.S. imperialism in the Korean question.

	Albanian representative Tashko in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly strongly denounced U.S. imperialism's aggression against Korea. He said that the United Nations' brutal interference in the internal affairs of the Korean people is a very ugly incident, indicating that the United Nations organization has become a tool of imperialist policy.

	The Albanian representative powerfully exposed the treacherous line pursued by the Soviet revisionist traitor group on the Korean question. He pointed out that in the current United Nations controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union, U.S. imperialists and their accomplices, the Soviet revisionists, are desperately using the so-called "Korean question" discussion to make new deals at the expense of the interests of the Korean people and further strengthen their counter-revolutionary collusion. He said: "The Soviet revisionists' deafening shouts and their efforts to pose as defenders of the Korean people cannot cover up their true betrayal of the genuine wishes and sovereignty of all Korean people."

	The Albanian representative emphasized: "The issue of Korean unification is an internal affair of the Korean people and can only be resolved by the Korean people according to their strong national aspirations, without external interference. The only obstacle to solving this problem is the United States, the presence of the U.S. occupation forces." The Albanian representative, in his speech, expressed that the People's Republic of Albania government unreservedly supports the just cause of the brotherly Korean people. He said: "We strongly condemn U.S. imperialism's aggression against the Korean people and the heinous crimes it has committed. We demand that the U.S. troops and their lackeys immediately and unconditionally withdraw from South Korea. We reiterate our demand: the United Nations organization should immediately disband the illegal 'United Nations Commission for the Unification and Rehabilitation of Korea.' The unification of Korea is a matter that can only be resolved by the Korean people, and no other country or organization has the right to interfere in this matter."

    联合国在美帝操纵下又一次粗暴干涉朝鲜内政
    公然通过“决议”支持美帝侵略朝鲜
    苏修代表在所谓“朝鲜问题”讨论中再次玩弄假支持真出卖手法
    新华社二十五日讯  在美帝国主义操纵下，第二十二届联合国大会又一次非法地讨论了“朝鲜问题”，并且在不久前通过了一项提案，公然继续支持美帝侵略朝鲜，粗暴干涉朝鲜内政。
    同往年一样，美国这次又纠集日本、泰国、菲律宾等国，在联合国大会上提出了一项十五国提案。提案规定，美国干涉朝鲜人民内部事务的工具“联合国韩国统一复兴委员会”继续“加紧努力”，谋求在美国侵略军武装霸占南朝鲜的情况下，通过美国安排的“自由选举”，来在朝鲜实现美帝国主义所需要的“统一”。提案还规定，只要没有实现美国控制联合国所制定的这种“持久解决办法的条件”，打着“联合国部队”旗号的美国侵略军就要继续长期占领南朝鲜。
    不顾阿尔巴尼亚和许多亚非国家的强烈反对，美国挟持在联合国中的多数，通过了它的这项提案。
    苏修代表在联大讨论中也提出了提案，假惺惺地表示支持朝鲜人民。但是，在阿尔巴尼亚提出修正案，明确指出联合国组织根本无权讨论“朝鲜问题”以后，苏修竟然拒绝了阿尔巴尼亚修正案，这就充分暴露了苏修集团在“朝鲜问题”上假支持真出卖的卑劣行径以及它伙同美帝国主义在朝鲜问题上进行罪恶勾结的真面目。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表陶沙尼在联合国大会上发言，强烈声讨美帝国主义侵略朝鲜。他说，联合国粗暴干涉朝鲜人民的内部事务，这是一件极丑恶的事件，表明联合国组织已经成为帝国主义政策的工具。
    阿尔巴尼亚代表有力地揭露了苏修叛徒集团在朝鲜问题上所奉行的叛卖路线。他指出，在美苏控制的目前的联合国中，美帝国主义者及其同伙苏联修正主义者，正在拚命利用所谓“朝鲜问题”的讨论，来进行牺牲朝鲜人民利益的新交易，并进一步加强他们的反革命勾结。他说：“苏联修正主义者震耳欲聋的叫嚷和他们竭力装作朝鲜人民的保卫者的架势，都掩盖不了他们对全体朝鲜人民的切身愿望和主权的真正叛卖。”
    阿尔巴尼亚代表强调说：“朝鲜统一问题是朝鲜人民的内部事务，只能由朝鲜人民按照自己的强烈的民族愿望来加以解决，而不得由外界干涉。”“解决这个问题的唯一障碍是美国，是美国占领军的存在。”阿尔巴尼亚代表在发言中表示，阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府毫无保留地支持兄弟的朝鲜人民的正义事业。他说：“我们强烈谴责美帝国主义对朝鲜人民的侵略和犯下的滔天罪行”，“我们要求美国军队及其仆从立即无条件撤出南朝鲜。我们再一次重申我们的要求：联合国组织立即解散非法的‘联合国韩国统一复兴委员会’。朝鲜的统一是只能由朝鲜人民来解决的问题，任何其他国家或组织都无权干涉这个问题。”
