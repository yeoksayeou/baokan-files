In the midst of the triumphant songs of "resuming classes and making revolution" in primary and secondary schools across the country, the great leader Chairman Mao issued his latest directives on educational revolution. The joyous news spread, and the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in the capital were filled with excitement. They unanimously declared: We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directives, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the main task, and immediately launch a new high tide of proletarian educational revolution. We will strive to be pioneers, vanguards, and proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Over a million revolutionary students, teachers, and workers in the capital's primary, secondary, and higher education institutions enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call to resume classes and make revolution. They are vigorously carrying out the proletarian educational revolution. They said with revolutionary fervor, Chairman Mao's latest directives are the extremely important mobilization order for carrying out the educational revolution at present, providing us with boundless wisdom and strength. They swiftly took action, seriously studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest directives, proposing suggestions, drafting plans, and holding oath-taking rallies. Revolutionary enthusiasm is soaring.

Last night, after hearing the broadcast of Chairman Mao's latest directives, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Beijing Forestry College carried Chairman Mao's giant portrait and held high red flags, marching through the campus and holding an oath-taking rally. The leaders of the revolutionary committee and many revolutionary teachers, students, and staff at the rally said, Great Leader Chairman Mao trusts the revolutionary masses the most, understands them the most, and respects their pioneering spirit the most. Under Chairman Mao's loving care and the guidance of his May 7th directives, we are determined to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end. The entire college's revolutionary teachers and students wrote in their letter of respect to the most beloved and respected Great Leader Chairman Mao: Dear Chairman Mao, you have taught us, "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." We will definitely follow your teachings and make new contributions to the people in the great proletarian educational revolution.

After hearing Chairman Mao's latest directives, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Normal University were greatly inspired and spurred on. This morning, the revolutionary committee convened a rally of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff. The revolutionary teachers and students declared that they would definitely act according to Chairman Mao's directives, take the May 7th directives as the highest guideline, and carry out the proletarian educational revolution, resolutely becoming proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Yesterday and today, many higher education institutions such as Beijing Agricultural University, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Beijing University of Geosciences, Beijing University of Mining and Technology, Beijing University of Hydraulic Engineering, Beijing Broadcasting Institute, China Medical University, University of Science and Technology of China, Tsinghua University, and Peking University held oath-taking rallies or conducted serious study and discussion. Many schools' revolutionary teachers, students, and staff studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest directives while proposing suggestions and researching plans based on the direction of educational revolution proposed by Chairman Mao in the May 7th directives. The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Agricultural University proposed bold reforms and plans for agricultural colleges. Inspired by Chairman Mao's latest directives, the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the Animal Husbandry and Veterinary departments of this university merged the two departments into one Animal Husbandry and Veterinary department based on the actual needs of China's animal husbandry production. This unreasonable division of departments was caused by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie. For over a decade, revolutionary teachers and students had repeatedly requested the merger but were always obstructed and suppressed. Today, the revolutionary teachers and students of the two departments celebrated their victory with drums and gongs. The revolutionary teachers, students, and workers of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics said, We revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, unite closely, and wage a "people's war" in the educational revolution. At last night's mass rally, the leaders of the revolutionary committee expressed their determination to learn humbly from the revolutionary comrades of Tongji University and other three schools, and to carry the educational revolution through to the end in a down-to-earth manner.

After studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, many schools' revolutionary teachers, students, and staff emphasized that Chairman Mao's May 7th directives and this latest directive have pointed out the fundamental direction and path for the proletarian educational revolution. We must definitely act according to Chairman Mao's directives and thoroughly end the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools. The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Post and Telecommunications University declared that they would definitely smash the bourgeois educational line and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, firmly grasping the educational power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools, who have universally resumed classes and made revolution, seriously studied and discussed Chairman Mao's latest directives. The revolutionary teachers and students of schools like Caochangdi Middle School, Dongqiao Middle School, and the 91st Middle School, who are advancing on the path of educational revolution, were even more elated and full of fighting spirit after hearing the latest directives from Great Leader Chairman Mao. The revolutionary teachers and students of Caochangdi Middle School, who have formulated an initial teaching reform plan according to Chairman Mao's May 7th directives, said, We have deeply felt from practice that educational revolution is the work of the masses. Only by relying on the masses, mobilizing the masses, and fully arousing the masses' enthusiasm, can we form a vast revolutionary army and thoroughly smash the old educational system. We will resolutely follow the course set by Chairman Mao, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the main task, and carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end.

After the great leader Chairman Mao's latest directives on proletarian educational revolution were issued, they sparked strong reactions among the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools. From last night to today, many schools have been boiling with excitement. Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students spread and studied Chairman Mao's latest directives. Many primary and secondary schools held oath-taking rallies for thorough educational reform, declaring that they would resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest directives, take "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the main task, and take Chairman Mao's May 7th directives as the goal of struggle, determined to be proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of Tongji University have been discussing their proposed initial educational reform ideas over the past few days. Last night, after hearing Chairman Mao's latest directives and the report in the People's Daily about their school's initial educational reform ideas, the entire school's revolutionary teachers and students jumped with excitement. They said, This is Chairman Mao's greatest concern, greatest encouragement, and greatest spur for us. Many classmates wrote big-character posters and proposed suggestions overnight, determined to take immediate action. Revolutionary teachers and students who had gone to the construction site to practice the initial educational reform plan also hurried back to school to participate in the study. The leader of the May 7th Commune, Wang Zhixing, said, Our reform plan is only an initial idea and is far from complete, and it still needs to be tested by revolutionary practice. We must further mobilize the masses, humbly listen to different opinions from all sides, especially the opinions of the broad masses of workers and technicians on the construction site, and continuously enrich and improve this plan to make greater contributions to the proletarian educational revolution. The revolutionary committee also convened an emergency meeting overnight to study and discuss Chairman Mao's latest directives, determined to quickly launch a new high tide of educational revolution throughout the school.

After hearing Chairman Mao's latest directives on educational revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students of East China Normal University held an oath-taking rally that night. At the rally, the speakers unanimously agreed that Chairman Mao's latest directives spoke the hearts of the revolutionary teachers and students. They declared that they would follow the direction indicated by Chairman Mao, boldly imagine, boldly practice, and boldly reform, becoming red guards of the educational revolution. At the rally, the revolutionary committee read out the school's initial educational reform plan, and the revolutionary teachers and students discussed this plan overnight.

Today, the revolutionary teachers and students of Fudan University, while studying and discussing Chairman Mao's latest directives, excitedly said, Our supreme commander Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and relies on the masses the most. He respects the pioneering spirit of the masses the most. He has entrusted the heavy responsibility of thoroughly carrying out the proletarian educational revolution to us. We must take Chairman Mao's educational revolution thoughts as our weapon, thoroughly eliminate the old educational system, and resolutely become proletarian revolutionaries who will carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end. Representatives from various departments and classes also visited Tongji University this afternoon to learn from their experiences in carrying out the educational revolution.

The revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai No. 2 Middle School, who have gained initial experience in the educational revolution, decided to continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to practice and daring to innovate after studying Chairman Mao's latest directives, teaching while reforming, and striving to come up with an initial plan for reforming the educational system and teaching content after a period of practice. The revolutionary youngsters of this middle school said, The proletarian educational revolution is an unprecedented great revolution in human history. In this great revolution, we must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of not fearing difficulties, perseverance, and practicality, and advance bravely along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao's May 7th directives. In the process of educational revolution, we must deeply examine our souls, consciously change our worldviews, and truly forge ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.
