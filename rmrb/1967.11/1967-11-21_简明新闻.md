    Over 30,000 Chilean Workers Strike Against Reactionary Bill

    Under the direction of the International Monetary Fund, which is controlled by the United States, the Chilean government recently passed a bill to pay part of workers' adjusted wages next year with "mandatory savings bonds." This decision has been strongly opposed by the broad masses of Chilean laborers.

    On the 15th, 25,000 workers of the national railway company and 5,200 workers of the state-owned public transportation company held a 24-hour strike to protest and condemn the government's plundering policy.

    Southern Italians Strike and Protest

    The people of Calabria in southern Italy, unable to bear the brutal exploitation by capitalists and landlords, have recently held strikes and protest demonstrations. The demonstrators engaged in fierce struggles with the reactionary police who came to suppress them. The just struggle of the people of Calabria has received firm support from the Italian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) and the broad masses in the region.

    West German Rubber Workers' Strike Expands in Hesse

    On the 14th, 3,100 workers at the Continental Rubber Factory in Korbach, Hesse, West Germany, went on strike, demanding wage increases and job security. This expanded the rubber workers' strike, which began on the 13th, to nearly 15,000 workers, accounting for three-quarters of all rubber workers in Hesse.

    Hesse is the center of West Germany's rubber industry. The strike has halted production at the five largest rubber factories in the state and seriously threatened the production of West Germany's automobile industry. This strike is the largest ever held by West German rubber industry workers to defend their own interests.

    Thai Reactionaries to Send Another 10,000 Cannon Fodder to South Vietnam

    On the 14th, the Thai puppet regime of Thanom, a faithful lackey of U.S. imperialism, brazenly announced that it would send another 10,000 cannon fodder to South Vietnam, thereby increasing the number of Thai mercenaries in South Vietnam from over 2,000 to a full division. This action shows that the Thai reactionaries are escalating their pursuit of U.S. aggression policies and are particularly eager to act as henchmen in the U.S. war against Vietnam.
