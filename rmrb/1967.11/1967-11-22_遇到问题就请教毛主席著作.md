Many Algerian friends repeatedly read and study Chairman Mao's works. A middle-aged friend from the eastern Algerian city of Annaba, upon meeting Chinese comrades in Algiers, said: "I read Chairman Mao's works every day, even if it means sleeping one or two hours less. The more I read, the more I feel that Chairman Mao's words are correct."

A student named Rabi, after reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," told a Chinese friend: "Chairman Mao's works are like a bright lamp, illuminating our path." Rabi also read Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On Contradiction" and "On Practice." He said that now, whenever he encounters any problem, he tries to solve it using the principles Chairman Mao taught.

    遇到问题就请教毛主席著作
    许多阿尔及利亚朋友反复阅读和学习毛主席的著作。一位从阿尔及利亚东部城市安纳巴来到阿尔及尔的中年朋友，见了中国同志就说：“毛主席的著作，我每天必读，少睡一两个小时也要阅读。越读越觉得毛主席说得有道理。”
    一位名叫拉比的学生读了《毛主席语录》后，对中国朋友说：“毛主席的著作象一盏明灯，照亮了我们的路程。”拉比还读了毛主席的光辉著作《矛盾论》和《实践论》。他说，他现在无论遇到什么问题，都学着用毛主席讲的道理去解决。
