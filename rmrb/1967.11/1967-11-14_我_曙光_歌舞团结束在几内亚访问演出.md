The "Dawn" Song and Dance Troupe of China concluded its 50-day friendly visit to Guinea on the morning of the 9th and departed from Conakry to the Republic of Iraq for a friendly visit. Those who went to the airport to see off the Chinese troupe included: Member of the Political Bureau of the Democratic Party of Guinea, State Secretary for Youth and Public Culture, Doul Mamouna, and other Guinean friends.

During their visit to Guinea, the Chinese troupe performed in seven cities including Conakry, Kindia, and Labe. Everywhere the Chinese artists went, they were warmly received by local people and government officials. Each performance by the Chinese actors was met with enthusiastic applause from the Guinean audience. They enthusiastically cheered for the Chinese revolutionary art that truly serves the broad masses of workers and peasants. They warmly praised the Chinese revolutionary art, which embodies the brilliant and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and the brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. During their visit to Guinea, the Chinese artists personally witnessed the boundless love and respect of the Guinean people for the great leader Chairman Mao. Throughout their journey of over a thousand kilometers, the Chinese artists heard the Guinean friends shouting the slogans "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" and "Long live Chairman Mao!" wherever they went. When they stopped to rest, many Guinean friends gathered around, greeting the troupe members and earnestly asking for Chairman Mao's badges, portraits, and copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao."
