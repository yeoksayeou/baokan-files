Students of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party Study Chairman Mao's Works and Achieve Great Results
Uphold the Absolute Authority of Mao Zedong Thought and Lead the World Revolution to Victory
Mao Zedong Thought is the Peak of Contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the Third Milestone in the History of Marxism

	Tokyo, November 25 (New China News Agency) – The organ of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party, "People's Star," recently published an article titled "Promote the Achievements of the County Party School and Further Develop the Movement to Study Mao Zedong Thought." The article points out that the first batch of students at the Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) Party School have made significant progress in studying Chairman Mao's works. This study has played an important role in raising the ideological and theoretical level of the leftists in Yamaguchi Prefecture and in promoting the movement to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought.

	The article states: The first batch of students (who began classes in mid-September) studied Chairman Mao's "Three Constantly Read Articles" and philosophical works such as "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," as well as "Suggestions on the General Line for the International Communist Movement." The "Three Constantly Read Articles" are the main study content for the entire county this year and are the central content for party building. Through study and discussion, everyone unanimously agreed that we must always regard the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our guiding principles, use the "Three Constantly Read Articles" as a mirror to constantly reform ourselves, and continue to regard the establishment of a revolutionary worldview as the central task of party building.

	The article states: The students who participated in the study believe that they have achieved very significant results in studying Chairman Mao's philosophical works. They believe that "On Practice" and "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" are Chairman Mao's extremely important contributions to dialectical materialism. Studying "On Contradiction" in conjunction with "On Practice" has played an important role in fundamentally rectifying our methods of thinking. "On Contradiction" is the highest development of dialectical materialism in contemporary times.

	The article points out: The four works "On Practice," "On Contradiction," "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" are essential and extremely important works for studying Mao Zedong Thought and must be repeatedly studied. They must be regarded as the most important theoretical weapons in revolutionary struggle. The Yamaguchi Prefecture Committee (Left Faction) of the Japanese Communist Party especially calls on all levels of organizations to organize the study of the important work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." This work is Chairman Mao's application of "On Contradiction" to socialist society, a brilliant and creative development of the theory of class and class struggle in socialist society, and an enrichment of the treasury of historical materialism. This work is an unprecedented programmatic document for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great historical document that raises the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat to an entirely new stage.

	The article states: In the process of studying "Suggestions on the General Line for the International Communist Movement," everyone enthusiastically discussed a series of important issues such as the third great struggle between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, the transition from capitalism to socialism, the issue of war and peace, the issue of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

	The article states: Through this study and discussion, the students once again clearly recognized that upholding the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism, is the key to leading the world revolution and the revolutions of various countries to victory. The students also deepened their understanding of the three great milestones in the history of Marxism, recognizing that Chairman Mao has brilliantly, comprehensively, and creatively developed the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, solving the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, leaping forward in the development of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and solving the problem of transitioning to communism in theory and practice. This is a clear sign that Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism and the third brilliant milestone in the history of Marxism.

	The article states: We must, according to Chairman Mao's teaching that "a great revolutionary movement cannot achieve victory without revolutionary theory, historical knowledge, and a deep understanding of the actual movement," comprehensively raise the theoretical level of the Yamaguchi Prefecture Party Organization (Left Faction).

	The article states: When promoting the movement to study Mao Zedong Thought, we must adopt the methods of studying with problems in mind, studying and applying actively, studying urgently needed topics first, and seeing immediate results. We must concretely apply Mao Zedong Thought to the Japanese revolution.

    日共山口县委（左派）党校学员学习毛主席著作获得巨大成果
    大树毛泽东思想绝对权威将世界革命引向胜利
    毛泽东思想是当代马列主义顶峰是马克思主义发展史上第三个光辉里程碑
    新华社二十五日讯  东京消息：日本共产党山口县委员会（左派）机关刊物《人民之星》不久前刊登一篇题为《发扬县党校学习成果，进一步开展毛泽东思想学习运动》的文章。文章指出，日共山口县委（左派）党校第一期学员学习毛主席著作取得很大成果，这次学习对提高山口县左派的思想理论水平和开展活学活用毛泽东思想运动起了重要作用。
    文章说：党校第一期（九月中旬开学）学员学习了毛主席的“老三篇”和《实践论》、《矛盾论》等哲学著作以及《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》。“老三篇”是今年全县主要的学习内容，也是建设党的中心学习内容。大家通过学习和讨论，一致认为必须始终把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，把“老三篇”当作镜子，不断地改造自己，把树立革命的世界观继续作为建党的中心课题。
    文章说，参加学习的学员认为，学习毛主席的哲学著作取得了非常大的成果。他们认为：《实践论》和《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》是毛主席对辩证唯物主义的极其重要的贡献。学习《矛盾论》同学习《实践论》结合起来进行，对于从根本上整顿思想方法起了重要的作用。《矛盾论》是唯物辩证法在当代的最高发展。
    文章指出：学习《实践论》、《矛盾论》、《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这四篇著作，是学习毛泽东思想的必读的极其重要的著作，必须反复地学习，把它们作为革命斗争的最重要的理论武器。日共山口县委（左派）特别号召各级组织必须组织学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一重要著作，因为这篇著作是毛主席把《矛盾论》运用到了社会主义社会，天才地创造性地发展了关于社会主义社会存在阶级和阶级斗争的理论，丰富了历史唯物主义的宝库。这篇著作是史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性文件，是把无产阶级专政的理论提高到一个完全崭新的阶段的伟大历史文献。
    文章说：在学习《关于国际共产主义运动总路线的建议》的过程中，大家热烈地讨论了马克思列宁主义同修正主义进行第三次大搏斗的问题、从资本主义向社会主义过渡的问题、战争与和平问题、无产阶级专政问题和中国无产阶级文化大革命等一系列的重要问题。
    文章说：通过这次学习和讨论，学员们再次明确了树立当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰——毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是把世界革命和各国革命引向胜利的关键。学员们还在学习中加深了对马克思主义发展史上三个伟大的里程碑的理解，认识到毛主席天才地、全面地、创造性地发展了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的理论，解决了在无产阶级专政的条件下继续革命，飞跃地发展社会主义革命和社会主义建设，在理论方面和实践方面解决了向共产主义过渡的问题。这是一个最明显的标志，它表明毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰，是马克思主义发展史上的第三个光辉的里程碑。
    文章说：必须根据毛主席的“指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的”这一教导，全面地提高山口县党组织（左派）的理论水平。
    文章说：开展学习毛泽东思想运动时，要采取带着问题学，活学活用，急用先学，立竿见影的方法，要把毛泽东思想具体地运用到日本革命中去。
