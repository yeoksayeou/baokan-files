Recently, we visited several districts in northern Albania and witnessed firsthand the heroic Albanian people, under the wise leadership of their great leader Comrade Enver Hoxha, and inspired by the revolutionary spirit of the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, striving to achieve revolutionization and develop production, achieving tremendous successes.

The Mountains Change and People Transform

Before the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, in the mountainous region of Kukes, only 43% of the land had been collectivized. After the Congress, the people of Kukes, inspired by the resolutions of the Congress, launched a high tide of agricultural collectivization. In just two and a half months, they completed the collectivization of the entire district. After collectivization, Kukes presented a prosperous scene everywhere. The people have never been as spirited and enthusiastic as they are now, and the agricultural production situation is excellent. Everywhere you can see new land reclaimed by the members, terraces built, and irrigation canals dug; fat sheep, lush corn, making the mountainous area even more beautiful.

Before the establishment of the cooperative, the area around Suluar could not produce enough food. After the establishment of the cooperative, after less than a year of hard work, they achieved self-sufficiency in food and turned this water-deficient dry land into a "water town." The Suluar Agricultural Production Cooperative was established on the morning of February 17, and by the afternoon, all members were at work, clearing land, accumulating fertilizer, and building water conservancy projects. The members reclaimed 58 hectares of land in a short period, planted corn and potatoes, and achieved a bumper harvest.

After the publication of the Central Committee of the Party of Labour of Albania and the Council of Ministers' announcement on April 29 this year, the members built a 5-kilometer-long irrigation canal and 14 small reservoirs in just two weeks, which can irrigate nearly 40 hectares of land. It is estimated that by the end of the fourth five-year plan, the entire cooperative's irrigation area will reach 90%. "Suluar" in Albanian originally means "cannot stand." Now, the members say that they not only can stand but also live very well.

Breaking Religious Superstition and Outdated Customs

After Comrade Hoxha's report on "Further Revolutionizing the Party and the State" was published on February 6 this year, the Albanian people rose up to vigorously eliminate religious superstition and outdated customs. In this sharp and complex class struggle, the people of Shkodra made tremendous contributions.

The city of Shkodra, located in northern Albania, was once a stronghold of reactionary Catholicism. After liberation, the representatives of the Vatican slunk away with their tails between their legs. However, the enemy was not willing to accept defeat and continued to carry out counter-revolutionary activities in Albania through their agents, committing all kinds of evil deeds. The people of Shkodra, who had long fought against reactionary religious forces, inspired by Comrade Hoxha's February 6 report, rose up to engage in fierce struggle with the reactionary religious forces, achieving a brilliant victory of breaking the old and establishing the new. In May, the people of Shkodra held a grand denunciation meeting. The masses who had been deceived and persecuted by the reactionary church angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the reactionary church forces at the meeting. Two extremely evil priests were arrested on the spot by the public security authorities and punished according to law, to the great satisfaction of the people.

The laboring masses, freed from religious shackles, are spirited and full of vigor. The Berdica Agricultural Production Cooperative installed electric lights this year, and the entire cooperative was overjoyed. A devout Catholic member said excitedly on the day the electricity was first turned on: "It is the Party of Labour that has brought us light." After this fierce struggle to break the old and establish the new, the spirit of the members of this cooperative has undergone a tremendous change. The attendance rate for labor is unprecedentedly high, and agricultural production is better than any other year. The fields are full of a harvest scene.

Women in Mirdita Become Masters of Their Lives

Before liberation, Mirdita was one of the most backward regions in Albania. Before liberation, women in Mirdita were at the lowest level of society, suffering from the oppression, exploitation, and bullying of the feudal ruling class. After liberation, they were liberated politically and no longer suffered from the bullying and exploitation of the landlords. However, the various feudal customs left over from the old society that ate people have not been completely eliminated. Comrade Hoxha's February 6 report was like a spring thunder, awakening the broad masses of women. They joined the broad revolutionary masses in striking at the feudal customs that discriminate against women, facing the dawn of the east, and advancing bravely on the road of socialist revolution and socialist construction.

During our visit to Mirdita, we saw that in the struggle against backward customs, many female heroes emerged. They dared to struggle and dared to win, and no feudal forces and backward customs could stop their advance. They have taken control of their own destinies and become masters of their lives. Now, there are eight women serving as branch secretaries, twenty-nine as deputy branch secretaries, eight as district committee members, and 361 serving as cadres in agricultural production cooperatives. There are 221 female cadres in the League of Labor Youth, and together with female cadres in other fields, there are more than 1,000 female cadres in the entire district. Some female advanced figures have been sent to study at the Higher Party School in Tirana; many activists who have broken the old and established the new have joined the Party of Labour and the League of Labor Youth. The girls of Mirdita performed excellently in the voluntary labor to build the Ferri-Logjcajn railway and received high praise from Comrade Hoxha, the beloved leader of the Albanian people.

If the Enemy Dares to Invade, Let It Perish!

On September 2, we visited the village of Tragobit in the district of Tropoja, accompanied by Comrade Bari Ajdini, the secretary of the Party of Labour district committee. This place borders Yugoslavia, ruled by the Tito clique, and is an important barrier in northern Albania. During our visit, we saw the heroic Albanian people holding a hoe in one hand and a gun in the other, vigilantly guarding the security of their socialist motherland, ready to smash any invaders at any time. Here, the old, the young, the women, and the children all have a steadfast will to fight: "If the enemy dares to invade us, let them perish." They are prepared to wage a people's war when the enemy invades, turning every inch of land here into a grave for the enemy.

The father of a martyr and a famous old patriot, Yusuf, said to us, "The enemy will not be able to pass through the Tragobit Gorge. We stand here like an insurmountable mountain. If the enemy wants to pass through here, they can only pass through our gun barrels. We will not retreat even a step; we stand here like the majestic mountains." Comrade Bari Ajdini asked the old man, "The Party calls on us, if the enemy invades, we will fight independently in the village and independently as individuals, striking the enemy everywhere. How will you fight?" The old man resolutely said, "Every inch of land here is a battlefield, every stone is a weapon, and every person is a soldier. We will not let the wolves in. If they come, I will go to the border and fight side by side with the border guards, annihilating them at the border."

Comrade Bari Ajdini introduced to the old man that the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in his telegram to the Fifth Congress of the Party of Labour of Albania, said: "The Soviet revisionist leadership clique, the Tito clique in Yugoslavia, all kinds of traitor and scab cliques, compared to you, they are nothing but a handful of yellow earth, and you are a mountain towering into the clouds." The old man was very moved after hearing this and said to us, "Please believe, Chinese comrades, that we will make ourselves forever worthy of being a mountain towering into the clouds."

Old man Yusuf spoke the words of the Albanian people, fully expressing the heroic spirit of the Albanian people, "Rather stand and die, than kneel and live." The mountains of Tragobit may be high, but not as high as the spirit of the people here; the waters of the Valbona flowing to the district of Tropoja may be clear, but not as clear as the hearts of the people of Tragobit. Such people are truly an iron wall, and any invader will be smashed to pieces and annihilated in front of them!

　　山鹰之国红旗飘
    最近，我们访问了阿尔巴尼亚北部的几个区，亲眼看到了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在自己的伟大领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的英明领导下，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会革命精神的鼓舞下，为实现革命化和发展生产所取得的巨大成就。
                    山换新装人变貌
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会以前，群山环抱的库克斯区只有百分之四十三的土地实现了合作化。党的第五次代表大会以后，库克斯区人民在大会决议的鼓舞下，掀起了农业合作化高潮，只不过短短的两个半月内就完成了全区农业合作化。合作化后的库克斯区到处呈现出一派欣欣向荣的景象，人民群众从来没有象现在这样精神焕发、斗志昂扬，农业生产形势大好。到处可见社员们开垦的新地、修筑的梯田和挖掘的水渠；肥壮的羊群，茂盛的玉米，把山区点缀得更加美丽。
    在未建立合作社前，苏劳尔一带粮食不能自给。成立合作社以后，经过不到一年的艰苦奋战，就实现了粮食自给，并把这一片缺水的旱地变为“水乡”。苏劳尔农业生产合作社在二月十七日上午刚刚成立，下午全体社员就出勤，开荒积肥，兴修水利。社员们在短期内开荒五十八公顷，种上了玉米和土豆，获得了大丰收。
    四月二十九日阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央和部长会议今年公告发表后，社员们又在两周时间内修建了一条长达五公里的水渠，十四个小型水库，可灌溉土地近四十公顷，并预计到第四个五年计划结束时，全社水利灌溉面积可达百分之九十。“苏劳尔”在阿尔巴尼亚文中原为“不能立足”的意思，现在社员们都说，他们现在不仅能够立足，而且生活得很好。
                 大破宗教迷信和落后习俗
    霍查同志今年二月六日关于《党和政权进一步革命化》的报告发表以后，阿尔巴尼亚人民起来大力破除宗教迷信和落后习俗。在这场尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争中，斯库台区人民做出了极其巨大的贡献。
    位于阿尔巴尼亚北部地区的重镇斯库台，曾经是天主教的反动巢穴。解放后，梵蒂冈的代表夹着尾巴溜走了。但是敌人并不甘心自己的失败，他们继续通过自己的代理人在阿尔巴尼亚进行反革命活动，为非作歹，干尽坏事。同反动的宗教势力进行了长期斗争的斯库台人民，在霍查同志二月六日报告的鼓舞下，起来同反动的宗教势力进行了激烈斗争，取得了破旧立新的光辉胜利。五月份，斯库台市人民举行了声势浩大的控诉大会，受反动教会欺骗和迫害的群众在会上愤怒控诉反动教会势力的滔天罪行，两名罪大恶极的神甫当场被公安机关逮捕，依法惩办，大快人心。
    脱离了宗教羁绊的劳动群众，精神焕发、干劲冲天。贝尔迪雅农业生产合作社今年安上了电灯，全社皆大欢喜。一位笃信过天主教的社员在开始送电的那天激动地说：“是劳动党给我们送来了光明。”这个社经过这场破旧立新的激烈斗争，社员的精神面貌发生了巨大变化，劳动出勤率空前提高，农业生产比过去任何一年都好，田野里一派丰收景象。
              米尔迪塔妇女成为生活的主人
    解放前的米尔迪塔区，是阿尔巴尼亚最落后的地区之一。解放前的米尔迪塔妇女，处于社会的最低层，受尽封建统治阶级的压迫、剥削和欺凌。解放后，她们在政治上得到了解放，再也不受地主老爷的欺负和剥削了。但是，吃人的旧社会遗留下来的种种封建习惯势力依然没有完全消灭。霍查同志二月六日的报告象一声春雷，唤醒了广大妇女。她们和广大革命群众一起痛击了歧视妇女的封建习惯势力，迎着东方的朝霞，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的大道上奋勇前进。
    我们在米尔迪塔区访问期间看到，在反对落后习俗的斗争中，涌现出许多妇女英雄人物，她们敢于斗争，敢于胜利，什么封建势力和落后习俗再也阻挡不住她们的前进。她们已经掌握了自己的命运，成为生活的主人。现在，这个区有八名妇女担任党支部书记，有二十九名担任副支部书记，有八名担任区委委员，担任农业生产合作社干部的达三百六十一名，劳动青年联盟组织中的妇女干部有二百二十一名，加上其他方面的妇女干部，全区妇女干部共达一千多名。一些妇女先进人物已被送进地拉那高级党校学习；许多破旧立新的积极分子加入了劳动党和劳动青年联盟。米尔迪塔区的姑娘在修建费里—洛格齐恩铁路的义务劳动中表现十分出色，受到阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的领袖霍查同志的高度赞扬。
            敌人敢来侵犯，就叫它灭亡！
    九月二日，我们在劳动党特罗波雅区委书记巴里阿依同志的陪同下，访问了特罗波雅区的特拉戈比乡。这里同铁托集团统治的南斯拉夫接壤，是阿尔巴尼亚北部的重要屏障。我们在访问中看到英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民一手拿镐，一手拿枪，正在高度警惕地保卫着社会主义祖国的安全，准备随时粉碎一切来犯者。这儿的老人、青年、妇女和儿童，都有一个钢铁般的战斗心愿：“如果敌人敢于侵犯我们，就叫他们灭亡。”他们准备在敌人一旦入侵的时候，打一场人民战争，把这里的每寸土地都变为敌人的坟墓。
    烈士的父亲、著名的老爱国战士优素福对我们说，“敌人休想通过特拉戈比峡谷。我们象一座不可逾越的高山一样挡在这里。如果敌人想穿过这儿，只有从我们的枪口穿过。我们决不后退一步，我们好象雄伟的群山一样巍然屹立。”巴里阿依同志问老人：“劳动党号召我们，一旦敌人入侵，我们就实行村自为战、人自为战，到处打击敌人。你准备怎么打呢？”老人毅然地说：“我们这儿的每寸土地都是战场，每块石头都是武器，每个人都是战士。我们决不能让豺狼进来，如果他们来了，我要到边境去和边防军并肩作战，把他们消灭在边境上。”
    巴里阿依同志向老人介绍，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席在致阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会的贺电中说：“苏联修正主义领导集团，南斯拉夫铁托集团，一切形形色色的叛徒和工贼集团，比起你们来，他们都不过是一抔黄土，而你们是耸入云霄的高山。”老人听了以后十分激动，并且对我们说：“请中国同志相信，我们将使自己永远无愧为耸入云霄的高山。”
    优素福老人说出了阿尔巴尼亚人民的心里话，充分表现了阿尔巴尼亚人民“宁可站着死，不愿跪着生”的英雄气概。特拉戈比的群山虽高，但没有这儿人民的志气高；流往特罗波雅区的瓦尔波尔的河水虽然清澈，但没有特拉戈比人民的心胸明亮，这样的人民是真正的铜墙铁壁，任何侵略者在它面前都将碰得头破血流，粉身碎骨！
