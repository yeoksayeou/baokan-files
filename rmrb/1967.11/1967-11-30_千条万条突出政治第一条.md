    Above All Else, Emphasize Politics
    Worker at the No. 9 Cotton Mill, Ni Haibao

    The Chinese Khrushchev, in 1950, at the National Conference of War Heroes and Labor Models, gave a black report, claiming that "if someone truly has a skill, a creation, an invention, regardless of other things, they can be a hero or a model." What does this mean? He wants to promote capitalism and revisionism's "production first," "technology first," to oppose the great Mao Zedong Thought.

    Our great teacher, Chairman Mao, has always taught us: "Without a correct political standpoint, it is like having no soul." Politics is the commander. This means that only with good politics can everything be good. If a person does not solve the problem of serving whom from a ideological standpoint, they will lose their direction. If the direction is wrong, even if you have a skill and work well, it will still be for personal gain, for fame and profit. But the Chinese Khrushchev wants to make people who do not want proletarian politics or revolution into "heroes" and "models," essentially setting up "standard-bearers" for the bourgeoisie.

    In class society, heroes and models have class characteristics. Each class has different standards for heroes and models. Proletarian heroes and models are proletarian warriors who serve the people wholeheartedly. They grow and strengthen under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, facing storms and trials, and make contributions to the revolutionary cause in the great waves of class struggle. The bourgeoisie's "heroes" and "models" serve the bourgeoisie. Even if they have so-called "skills" and "creations," they are against the working people. The bourgeois experts in imperialist countries who develop atomic bombs can be said to have "a skill" and "a creation," but they are butchers of the Vietnamese people and the revolutionary people of the world! People like Deng Tuo and Wu Han, these counter-revolutionary revisionists, have anti-party "skills" and "creations" and "inventions." Who, except the enemy, would learn from such people? But the old scoundrel, the Chinese Khrushchev, openly calls on us workers to learn from and align with those who only want technology and not politics. This is his dream of restoring capitalism; he is also afraid that we workers will have Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, exposing his plot, so he tries every means to corrupt us with fame and position. His intentions are truly evil!

    千条万条突出政治第一条
    国棉九厂工人　倪海宝
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，一九五○年在全国战斗英雄劳动模范代表会议上大作黑报告，胡说什么“如果真有一门本事，真有一种创造，真有一种发明，不管其他好不好，就可以是英雄或者是模范”。他这是啥个意思呢？他就是要搞资本主义、修正主义的“生产第一”、“技术第一”，同伟大的毛泽东思想唱对台戏。
    我们伟大的导师毛主席一直教导我们：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”政治是统帅。这说明只有政治好，才能样样好。一个人要是不从思想上解决为谁服务的问题，就会迷失方向。方向不对头，就是你真有一门本事，工作做得“好”，也是“私”字当头，为名为利的。而中国赫鲁晓夫却偏偏要把一些不要无产阶级政治，不要革命的人，封为“英雄模范”，实质上就是为资产阶级树立“标兵”。
    在阶级社会里，英雄模范是有阶级性的。每个阶级对英雄模范都有着自己不同的标准。无产阶级的英雄模范，是全心全意为人民服务的无产阶级战士，他们在毛泽东思想的哺育下，经风雨，见世面，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中成长壮大，为革命事业作出贡献。资产阶级的“英雄模范”，是为资产阶级服务的，他们即使真有所谓“本事”和“创造”，也是与我们劳动人民作对的。帝国主义国家搞原子弹的资产阶级专家，可算是“有一门本事”、“有一种创造”，但他们是屠杀越南人民和世界革命人民的刽子手！邓拓、吴晗这些反革命修正主义分子，他们有的是反党的“本事”和“创造”“发明”，象这样的人，除了敌人以外，谁会向他们学习呢？而中国赫鲁晓夫这个老工贼，却偏偏公开号召我们工人向只要技术，不要政治的人学习、看齐，这是他梦想复辟资本主义；又怕我们工人脑子里有了毛泽东思想，戳穿了他的阴谋，所以就千方百计用名誉地位来腐蚀我们工人阶级，用心真是毒透毒透！
    中国赫鲁晓夫，你听着，千变万变，突出无产阶级政治不能变；千条万条，突出无产阶级政治第一条。你想把我们引入歧途，办不到！（本报转载时略有修改）
