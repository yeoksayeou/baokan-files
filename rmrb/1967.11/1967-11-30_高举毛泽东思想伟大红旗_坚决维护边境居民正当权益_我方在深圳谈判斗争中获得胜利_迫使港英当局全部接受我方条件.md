After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country lodged a serious protest with the British government on October 20 regarding the provocative actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong in the Shenzhen border area, representatives from the British authorities in Hong Kong held talks with representatives from the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station. They have fully accepted the conditions put forward by our side and have begun to implement them.

In recent times, the British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly created tensions in the Shenzhen border area. In mid-October, the British authorities arbitrarily set up barbed wire in the middle of our farmers' fields and even forcibly blocked the important traffic route at Man Kam To, seriously disrupting normal traffic and order at the border, hindering our people's production activities, and infringing upon their legitimate rights. For this reason, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged a serious protest with the British government on October 20 and demanded that the British government order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately remove the obstacles at the Man Kam To Bridge and the barbed wire in our farmers' fields, restore normal traffic and order at the border, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

Starting from November 1, representatives from the British authorities in Hong Kong came to Shenzhen to discuss the aforementioned border issues with our Border Inspection Station. During the negotiations, our representatives held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely safeguarded the legitimate rights of our border residents. Through struggle, they finally forced the British representatives to fully accept the conditions put forward by our side.

According to the agreement reached by both sides, the British authorities in Hong Kong reiterated their guarantee of the personal safety of the residents of Ba'an County when they cross the border for production and other normal activities, and guaranteed that their rights to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought would not be infringed upon; they agreed to completely remove the obstacles at the Man Kam To Bridge; within the stipulated time, they agreed to completely remove the barbed wire set up in our farmers' fields along the entire border line; they agreed to compensate for the losses suffered by our farmers due to the blockade of the Man Kam To Bridge; they agreed to compensate for the damaged graves at the back of the Man Kam To Hill; they agreed to return the five members of our commune who were illegally detained by the British authorities in Hong Kong, etc.

On the 26th, the British authorities in Hong Kong began to implement the conditions as stipulated. The British military police removed all obstacles at the Man Kam To Bridge, allowing the Man Kam To passage to resume. The five members of our side who were illegally detained by the British returned to Shenzhen Bridgehead in victory and were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses of Shenzhen. At this time, the Shenzhen Border Inspection Station returned the two British police who had entered our territory and were detained for investigation to the other side.

The border residents of Shenzhen enthusiastically celebrated this victory in the negotiations. This is a new victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in border struggles, the result of the resolute struggle of our border revolutionary masses against the British authorities in Hong Kong, and a great support for the anti-British and anti-violence struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. They all expressed their determination to remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are utterly ruined—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." They will not relax their vigilance against imperialist elements and their running dogs. They solemnly warn the British authorities in Hong Kong that they must fully fulfill the conditions they have accepted. If they dare to make trouble and continue to provoke, they will surely face more severe punishment from the Chinese people. The border revolutionary masses also resolutely declared that they will definitely support the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong to carry out the anti-British and anti-violence struggle to the end.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　坚决维护边境居民正当权益
    我方在深圳谈判斗争中获得胜利
    迫使港英当局全部接受我方条件
    新华社广州二十九日电　我国外交部十月二十日就香港英国当局在深圳边境地区的挑衅行为向英国政府提出严重抗议以后，香港英国当局派出代表同我深圳边防检查站代表进行了商谈，已于十一月二十五日全部接受我方提出的条件，并已开始付诸实现。
    近一时期来，港英当局不断在深圳边境地区制造紧张局势。十月中旬，港英当局蛮横无理地又重新在我农民耕地中间架设铁丝网，甚至强行封锁文锦渡交通要道，严重破坏了边境的正常交通和秩序，妨害我方群众生产活动，侵犯了他们的正当权益。为此，我外交部十月二十日向英国政府提出严重抗议，并要求英国政府责成港英当局立即撤除文锦渡桥头的障碍物和我农民耕地上的铁丝网，恢复边境上的正常交通和秩序，并且保证不再发生类似事件。
    十一月一日开始，港英当局派出代表来到深圳，就上述边境问题同我边防检查站进行商谈。在谈判过程中，我方代表高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决维护我边境居民的正当权益，经过斗争，终于迫使港英代表不得不全部接受了我方提出的条件。
    根据双方达成的协议，港英当局重申保证我宝安县边境居民过境生产和进行其它正常活动时的人身安全，并保证他们学习和宣传毛泽东思想的权利不受侵犯；答应全部拆除文锦渡桥头的障碍物；在限期内全部拆除边境全线架设在我农民耕地上的铁丝网；负责赔偿因封锁文锦渡桥所造成的我方农民的损失；赔偿被损毁的文锦渡后山坟墓；送回被港英当局无理拘捕的我方五名人民公社社员等。
    二十六日，港英当局按照规定的条件开始执行。港英军警撤除了文锦渡桥头的所有障碍物，使文锦渡通道恢复通行。被港英无理拘捕的我方五名社员从深圳桥头胜利归来，受到深圳革命群众的热烈欢迎。这时，我深圳边防检查站将越入我境被我扣留审查的两名港英警察放回对方。
    深圳边境群众热烈欢呼这次谈判斗争的胜利。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想在边防斗争中的新胜利，是我边境革命群众同港英当局进行坚决斗争的结果，也是对香港爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争的巨大支持。他们纷纷表示要牢记毛主席的教导：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”决不放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗的警惕性。他们严正警告港英当局，必须全部兑现已经接受的这些条件，如果胆敢捣乱，继续挑衅，必将受到中国人民更严厉的惩罚。边境革命群众并坚决表示，一定要支持香港爱国同胞将反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
