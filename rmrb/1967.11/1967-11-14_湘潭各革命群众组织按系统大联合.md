Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The people of Xiangtan resolutely carry out your instructions.

Revolutionary mass organizations in Xiangtan achieve great unity by system.

Eight revolutionary mass organization headquarters are adjusted into unified preparatory committees for workers', peasants', and students' congresses.

Over ten million revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat celebrate the achievement of great unity among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, November 13th — The proletarian revolutionary cadres in Xiangtan City, following the instructions of our great leader Chairman Mao, have taken "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" as the key link, achieving great unity among the revolutionaries. They have merged and adjusted the original eight revolutionary mass organization headquarters, such as Xiangtan Red Constructive Alliance, Xiangtan Workers' Alliance, and Xiangtan Xiangjiang Thunder, into unified preparatory committees for workers', peasants', and students' congresses by system and by industry. On November 3rd, over ten million revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of the proletariat held a grand celebration to commemorate the achievement of great unity among the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Xiangtan City have broken through the numerous obstacles set up by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, smashed the barriers between units and departments, and marched out into society, forming revolutionary mass organizations such as Xiangtan Red Constructive Alliance, Xiangtan Workers' Alliance, and Xiangtan Xiangjiang Thunder. They have established immortal merits for the proletarian cultural revolution in Xiangtan City.

The series of extremely important instructions given by Chairman Mao during his inspections of North China, Central-South China, and East China have greatly inspired the proletarian revolutionary cadres in Xiangtan City. Chairman Mao said, "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." Many proletarian revolutionary cadres in factories, enterprises, schools, and government agencies in Xiangtan City, following Chairman Mao's instructions, have withdrawn from their original revolutionary mass organization headquarters and united within their own units. Under these circumstances, should the original revolutionary mass organization headquarters continue to exist, or should they adapt to the new situation and tasks of the struggle by making necessary adjustments by system and by industry? The 69000th Unit, which was dispatched to Xiangtan City to support the left, convened a study class on Mao Zedong Thought for the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations to address this issue. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and focused on solving the ideological problems that arose during the great unity of the revolution. Through study and discussion, the majority of comrades raised their awareness and decided to achieve great unity by system according to the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, requesting the dissolution of the original revolutionary mass organization headquarters. However, a few comrades, while agreeing to achieve great unity, believed that their organization had the greatest merits in the proletarian cultural revolution and should become the core of the great unity. The supporting leftist troops of the People's Liberation Army, addressing these thoughts, organized them to study Chairman Mao's works and recall the process of the proletarian cultural revolution in Xiangtan City over the past year. They said, during the frenzied persecution of the proletarian revolutionary cadres by the bourgeois reactionary line, the proletarian revolutionary cadres united as one, defying the current and fighting the waves, with only one common wish: to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. No one thought of "me as the core." Now, the proletarian cultural revolution has achieved decisive victories, but the thought of "me as the core" has emerged. This is a manifestation of arrogance from taking credit. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Even if our work has achieved extremely great successes, there is no reason for us to be arrogant and self-satisfied." The proletarian cultural revolution is helmed by our great leader Chairman Mao, and Chairman Mao has dispatched the People's Liberation Army of China to strongly support us. The merits should be attributed to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, not to our own organization. Many comrades said, "me as the core" is the "selfishness" at work. This evil "selfishness" obstructs our comrades-in-arms who have shared life and death from uniting. We must resolutely criticize revisionism and repudiate selfishness to achieve great unity in the revolution.

Some comrades were worried that dissolving the original headquarters and establishing new revolutionary mass organizations would reduce the number of leaders, and they might not be able to become leaders again. Addressing this thought, they studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and compared themselves to heroes like Zhang Side. "All our work comrades, regardless of their position, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people's service..." Chairman Mao's words are all truths, worth ten thousand words. Once they studied, their hearts became clear. Some comrades said, we should act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Being a leader can serve the people, and not being a leader can also serve the people. They expressed their willingness to learn from Zhang Side, Lei Feng, and Ouyang Hai, to serve the people wholeheartedly, without worrying about personal status.

Some comrades believed that their organization was correct and the most revolutionary, while their brother organizations had many errors and shortcomings. This was also an ideological obstacle to achieving great unity. Addressing this thought, the supporting leftist troops introduced the fighting history of the People's Liberation Army of China, guiding them to follow Chairman Mao's teachings on "practicing open, mass-based self-criticism (each side criticizes only itself, not the other side), and thoroughly correcting it." They deeply felt: in the past, they only saw the dust on others' faces, the more they looked, the more they disliked it; they only talked about others' shortcomings, the more they talked, the less they agreed. Now, everyone talks about the shortcomings and errors of their own organization, and they find others more agreeable and acceptable.

After criticizing the erroneous thoughts that obstructed the great unity, everyone, with the spirit of "seizing the day," quickly achieved the great unity and issued a joint statement to the people of the entire city. The broad revolutionary masses, upon hearing this good news, excitedly shouted: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years!

### 湘潭各革命群众组织按系统大联合

    毛主席啊，毛主席！湘潭儿女坚决按照您的指示办事
    湘潭各革命群众组织按系统大联合
    八个革命群众组织总部调整成统一的工、农、学生代表大会筹备组织
    联合起来的无产阶级革命派和革命群众十万人隆重举行庆祝大会
    新华社长沙十三日电　湖南湘潭市的无产阶级革命派，遵照伟大领袖毛主席的指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，实现了革命大联合。他们把原来的湘潭红造联、湘潭工联、湘潭湘江风雷等八大革命群众组织总部，按照系统、按照行业合并调整成统一的工业、农业和学生的代表大会筹备组织。十一月三日，联合起来的无产阶级革命派和革命群众十万人隆重集会，庆祝无产阶级革命派革命大联合的实现。
    一年多来，湘潭市无产阶级革命派冲破了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派设置的重重障碍，打破单位之间、部门之间的界限，杀向社会，组成了湘潭红造联、湘潭工联、湘潭湘江风雷等革命群众组织，为湘潭市的无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。
    毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区所作的一系列极为重要的指示，极大地鼓舞了湘潭市的无产阶级革命派。毛主席说：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”湘潭市许多工厂、企业、学校、机关的无产阶级革命派，遵照毛主席的指示，纷纷退出原来的革命群众组织总部，在本单位联合起来。在这种情况下，原来的各个革命群众组织的总部是继续存在，还是适应新的形势和斗争任务的需要，按系统、按行业进行必要的调整？六九○○部队派驻湘潭市支左的部队，针对这个问题，召集各革命群众组织的负责人开办了毛泽东思想学习班，认真学习毛主席的最新指示，集中解决他们在革命大联合中出现的思想问题。通过学习、讨论，绝大多数同志提高了认识，决心按照毛主席和党中央的指示，按系统实现革命大联合，要求把原来各革命群众组织的总部撤销。但是，有少数同志虽然赞成实现革命大联合，却认为自己的组织在无产阶级文化大革命中功劳最大，应该成为革命大联合的核心。解放军支左部队，针对这些思想，组织他们学习毛主席著作，回忆一年多来湘潭市无产阶级文化大革命的历程。他们说，在资产阶级反动路线向无产阶级革命派进行疯狂迫害时，无产阶级革命派团结一致，顶逆流，战恶浪，大家只有一个共同的心愿，誓死保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁也没有想到“以我为核心”。现在，无产阶级文化大革命取得了决定性的胜利，却产生了“以我为核心”的思想，这是居功骄傲的表现。毛主席教导我们：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。”无产阶级文化大革命是伟大领袖毛主席给我们掌舵，毛主席派中国人民解放军大力支持我们，功劳应该归于毛主席和以毛主席为首的党中央，不应该把功劳记在自己组织的账上。许多同志说，“以我为核心”，是“私”字作怪。这个万恶的“私”字，阻碍着我们同生死，共患难的战友不能联合起来，我们必须坚决斗私批修，实现革命的大联合。
    有的同志耽心撤销原来的总部，成立新的革命群众组织，负责人要减少，自己能否再当上领导人。针对这种思想，他们学习了“老三篇”，对照张思德等英雄形象，检查自己。“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务，……”毛主席的话句句是真理，一句顶一万句，一学心里就亮堂。有的同志说，我们要照毛主席的指示办事，当领导人能为人民服务，不当领导人同样能为人民服务。他们表示要向张思德、雷锋、欧阳海学习，全心全意为人民服务，不计较个人地位。
    有的同志认为，自己的组织正确，革命最坚决，兄弟组织错误缺点多。这也是实现革命大联合的一个思想障碍。针对这种思想，支左部队的同志，向他们介绍了中国人民解放军的斗争史，引导他们按照毛主席关于“实行公开的群众性的自我批评（各方面只批评自己，不批评对方），而彻底改正之”的教导，对过去自己组织中的缺点错误作了自我批评。他们深有体会地说：过去一看就是看别人脸上的灰尘，越看越不顺眼；一讲就讲别人的缺点，越讲越不服气。现在大家讲自己组织的缺点错误，看别人就顺眼了，服气了。
    批判了障碍革命大联合的错误思想以后，大家以“只争朝夕”的精神，很快实现了革命大联合，并向全市人民发出了联合声明。广大革命群众听到这一喜讯，都兴奋地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
