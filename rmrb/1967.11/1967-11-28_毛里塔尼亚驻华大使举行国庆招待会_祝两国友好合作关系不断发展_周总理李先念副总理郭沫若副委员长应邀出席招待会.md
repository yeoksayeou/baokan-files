According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 27th, Mauritania's Ambassador to China, Harich, held a reception tonight to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the independence of the Islamic Republic of Mauritania.

Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Guo Moruo attended the reception at the invitation.

Ambassador Harich and Vice Premier Li Xiannian both spoke at the reception, wishing for the continued development of friendly cooperation between China and Mauritania and the deepening of friendship between the two peoples.

In his speech, Ambassador Harich introduced the achievements made by the Mauritanian people in building their country over the past few years.

The ambassador said that President Moktar Ould Daddah's recent visit to China allowed the leaders of Mauritania to personally experience the great significance of the success of the great Chinese revolution and to directly understand the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by your great teacher, Chairman Mao Zedong.

The ambassador praised the struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people, stating that the Vietnamese people will surely win. In his speech, the ambassador condemned the colonialists for continuing to maintain their rule over some African countries and condemned the Israeli imperialist-Zionist gang for refusing to withdraw from the Arab lands they have occupied.

The ambassador praised the friendship between the peoples of Mao and China, and thanked the Chinese people for their support and aid to the Mauritanian people.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, in his speech, praised the Mauritanian people for their active efforts and achievements in consolidating national independence, developing national economy and culture; praised the Mauritanian government for its policy of non-alignment in foreign affairs, opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, supporting the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, supporting the national independence movements of African countries that have not yet gained independence, and supporting the anti-aggression struggle of the Arab people; praised the Mauritanian government for taking a firm stand, firmly advocating the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations, and opposing any conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that the current situation in the world is excellent. The ranks of Marxism-Leninism are continuously expanding and strengthening. The national democratic revolutionary movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are developing vigorously, and more and more people are taking up armed struggle. He emphasized that imperialism is very weak! Modern revisionism is also very weak! They are all what the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, calls "paper tigers." To thoroughly oppose imperialism, one must firmly draw a clear line of demarcation with modern revisionism.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has opened up a bright path for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end. Our victory has strongly supported and encouraged the proletariat and revolutionary people all over the world, and has strongly supported and encouraged all oppressed nations and peoples. Therefore, they enthusiastically praise and sympathize with China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Not long ago, President Moktar Ould Daddah of Mauritania visited China and highly praised China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We appreciate the support of our friends; we despise the attacks of our enemies, and when necessary, we will also strike back.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said, We believe that the friendship between the peoples of China and Mauritania will continue to develop, because our friendship is based on unity against imperialism and colonialism, and is based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. This is a solid friendship.

Those who attended the reception at the invitation included officials from various departments, envoys from various countries to China, and African friends visiting Beijing.

    毛里塔尼亚驻华大使举行国庆招待会
    祝两国友好合作关系不断发展
    周总理李先念副总理郭沫若副委员长应邀出席招待会
    据新华社二十七日讯  毛里塔尼亚驻中国大使哈尔希今晚举行招待会，热烈庆祝毛里塔尼亚伊斯兰共和国独立七周年。
    周恩来总理、李先念副总理、郭沫若副委员长等，应邀出席了招待会。
    哈尔希大使和李先念副总理先后在招待会上讲话，共祝中毛两国之间的友好合作关系和两国人民的友谊不断发展。
    哈尔希在讲话中介绍了毛里塔尼亚人民几年来建设自己的国家所取得的成就。
    大使说，莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫总统不久前对中国的访问，使得毛里塔尼亚的领导人通过亲自经历认识到伟大中国革命成功的广阔意义，他们得以直接地了解由你们的伟大导师毛泽东主席领导的无产阶级文化大革命。
    大使赞扬英雄的越南人民的斗争，指出越南人民必胜。大使在讲话中谴责殖民主义者继续维持对非洲一些国家的统治，谴责以色列帝国主义——犹太复国主义匪帮拒绝从它们占领的阿拉伯的土地上撤退。
    大使在讲话中称颂毛中两国人民的友谊，并感谢中国人民给予毛里塔尼亚人民的支持和援助。
    李先念副总理在讲话中，赞扬毛里塔尼亚人民，为巩固民族独立，发展民族经济和民族文化，作出了积极的努力，并且取得了成绩；赞扬毛里塔尼亚政府奉行不结盟的对外政策，反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，支持越南人民的英勇斗争，支持非洲未独立国家的民族独立运动，支持阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争；赞扬毛里塔尼亚政府采取严正立场，坚决主张恢复中国在联合国的合法权利，反对任何制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    李先念副总理指出，当前全世界是一片大好的革命形势。马克思列宁主义的队伍不断发展壮大。亚非拉的民族民主革命运动正在猛烈开展，越来越多的人民走上武装斗争的道路。他强调指出，帝国主义虚弱得很！现代修正主义也虚弱得很！他们统统是中国人民伟大领袖毛泽东主席所说的“纸老虎”。要彻底反帝，就要坚决同现代修正主义划清界限。
    李先念副总理说，中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，开辟了一条巩固无产阶级专政，将社会主义革命进行到底的光明大道。我们的胜利，有力地支持和鼓舞了全世界无产阶级和革命人民，有力地支持和鼓舞了一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，所以他们热情地称赞和同情中国的无产阶级文化大革命。不久以前，毛里塔尼亚总统莫克塔·乌尔德·达达赫阁下访问中国，高度赞扬了中国的无产阶级文化大革命。对朋友的支持，我们感谢；对敌人的攻击，我们鄙视，在必要的时候，我们还要给予回击。
    李先念副总理说，我们相信，中毛两国人民的友谊一定会进一步发展，因为我们的友谊是建立在团结反帝反殖的基础上，是建立在和平共处五项原则的基础上。这种友谊是牢固的友谊。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有各部门的负责人，和各国驻中国使节，以及正在北京访问的非洲朋友。
