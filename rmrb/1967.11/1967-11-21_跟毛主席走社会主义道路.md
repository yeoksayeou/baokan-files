		Editor's Note from *Liberation Daily*: The poor and lower-middle peasants and the activists of studying Chairman Mao's works in Hongjin Production Brigade, Shaxi Commune, Taicang County, Jiangsu Province, with their strong class sentiments of boundless love, loyalty, faith, and admiration for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and with their deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, have carried out extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism. One of their main methods is: study one quotation from Chairman Mao, criticize one reactionary point of the Chinese Khrushchev, eliminate one aspect of poison, and clarify one revolutionary viewpoint. This is a very good method.

		This method is good first of all because it closely combines the extensive study of Chairman Mao's works with the extensive criticism of the revolution, and through extensive study and criticism, it establishes the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, raising the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

		This method is also good because it combines the criticism of revisionist fallacies with the elimination of the influence of the exploiting class's ideology. While criticizing the reactionary points of the Chinese Khrushchev, it also exposes the ideology of the exploiting class.

		The old thoughts of the exploiting class originated from private ownership and in turn defended and served private ownership. They are the natural soil for revisionism. In our country, although the socialist public ownership has replaced private ownership, the old thoughts of the exploiting class that advocate for private ownership still exist in large quantities. Dust needs to be swept away with a broom. The poison of revisionism and the influence of the exploiting class's thoughts must be thoroughly cleansed with the most sharp weapon of Mao Zedong Thought. The poor and lower-middle peasants and the activists of studying Chairman Mao's works in Hongjin Production Brigade study one quotation from Chairman Mao and criticize one revisionist point and the old thoughts of the exploiting class, with a very serious and solemn attitude. This spirit is very precious.

		In the struggle of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating oneself," let us all learn from their revolutionary spirit, inch by inch, to sweep away revisionism and all the old thoughts of the exploiting class, so that every inch of land in our country can be planted with the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought!

		Published here are some of the speeches made by the poor and lower-middle peasants and the activists of studying Chairman Mao's works in Hongjin Production Brigade during their revolutionary criticism.

		Quotation from Chairman Mao:
		Besides socialism, there is no other way.

		Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense: "...All methods that can mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm are acceptable. Don't say which method is the best and the only one."

		"Industry should retreat sufficiently, and agriculture should retreat sufficiently. This includes contracting production to households and individual farming."

		Follow Chairman Mao on the Socialist Road
		Sixth Production Team's Old Poor Peasant, Wang Guisheng

		Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out the most correct socialist direction. Following the socialist direction indicated by Chairman Mao, our path becomes wider and wider. However, the Chinese Khrushchev opposes us following Chairman Mao on the socialist road. He says, "Don't say which method is the best and the only one." In other words, whether it is socialism or capitalism, as long as it can "mobilize" the peasants' production enthusiasm, it is fine. What method does he use to "mobilize" the peasants' enthusiasm? "Retreating in agriculture" is one of his "tricks." How is it considered "retreating"? He openly says: contracting production to households and individual farming. This statement hits the nail on the head. He wants to return the land to the landlords and drag us back to the old capitalist road!

		Anyone with a bit of common sense knows that there are two kinds of "enthusiasm": socialist and capitalist. Contracting production to households and individual farming, landlords and rich peasants have the most "enthusiasm," and some well-off middle peasants also have this "enthusiasm." We poor and lower-middle peasants only have socialist enthusiasm and collective production enthusiasm, and we do not have the enthusiasm for contracting production to households and individual farming. When the black wind of contracting production to households and individual farming blew to our place, we firmly opposed it. The bitter days of the old society, I will never forget them. Before liberation, I worked as a long-term laborer for a landlord for more than ten years, eating pig and dog food, and doing cow and horse work. The Chinese Khrushchev wants to "retreat" in agriculture and to practice contracting production to households and individual farming, which means to put the three knives of the old society—rented grain, borrowed grain, and usury—back on our necks, to tie the three ropes that bind the poor in the old society—imprisonment, starvation, and suicide—on our poor and lower-middle peasants, and to put the three big mountains of the old society—imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—back on our heads. This is absolutely not allowed.

		The Chinese Khrushchev, this negative teacher, has taught us: we must heighten our class vigilance, better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely fight against the "self" in our minds, eliminate the influence of spontaneous capitalist tendencies, establish the "public" spirit, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, and make sure he never stands up again.

### 跟毛主席走社会主义道路

    《解放日报》编者按：江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队贫下中农和学习毛主席著作积极分子，怀着对毛主席、对毛泽东思想的无限热爱、无限忠诚、无限信仰、无限崇拜的强烈的阶级感情，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫的深仇大恨，广泛深入地开展革命的大批判。他们所采用的一个主要办法是：学习一条毛主席语录，批判中国赫鲁晓夫一个反动论点，肃清一个方面的流毒，明确一个革命观点。这是一个很好的办法。
    这个办法首先好在把毛主席著作的大学习和革命的大批判紧密地结合在一起，通过大学习、大批判，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的水平。
    这个办法好，还好在把批判修正主义的谬论同肃清剥削阶级的思想影响结合在一起，在批臭中国赫鲁晓夫反动论点的同时，搞臭了那些剥削阶级的意识形态。
    剥削阶级的旧思想，从私有制产生，又反过来为私有制辩护、为私有制服务，它是修正主义的天然土壤。在我国，社会主义公有制虽然已经代替了私有制，但是为私有制招魂的剥削阶级的旧思想依然大量存在。灰尘要靠扫帚去扫。修正主义的流毒，剥削阶级的思想影响，必须用毛泽东思想这一最最锐利的武器逐一地去涤荡。洪泾大队贫下中农和学习毛主席著作的积极分子，学一条毛主席语录，就批一个修正主义论点和剥削阶级旧思想，态度十分认真、严肃。这种精神是十分可贵的。
    在“斗私，批修”的斗争中，让我们大家都来学习他们这种革命精神，一寸一寸地去扫除修正主义和一切剥削阶级的旧思想，使我国每一寸土地都插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗！
    这里发表的，是洪泾大队贫下中农和学习毛主席著作积极分子开展革命大批判的一部分发言，特向读者推荐。
    毛主席语录
    除了社会主义，再无别的出路。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：……一切有利于调动农民积极性的办法都可以。不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的。
    工业上要退够，农业上也要退够。包括包产到户、单干。
    跟毛主席走社会主义道路
    第六生产队老贫农　王桂生
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指明的社会主义方向，是最最正确的方向，我们沿着毛主席指引的社会主义方向，道路越走越宽。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却反对我们跟毛主席走社会主义道路。他说：“不要说那一种办法是最好的，唯一的”。也就是说，什么社会主义、资本主义，只要能“调动”农民的生产积极性就行。他用什么办法来“调动”农民积极性的呢？“农业退够”就是他的“法宝”之一。怎样算“退够”？他毫不隐瞒地说：包产到户、单干。这句话说到了问题的根子，他是要把土地退到地主手里，把我们拉到资本主义老路上去哩！
    有一点常识的人就会知道，“积极性”有两种：社会主义的和资本主义的。包产到户、单干，地主、富农最有“积极性”，一些富裕中农也有这种“积极性”。我们贫下中农只有社会主义的积极性、集体生产的积极性，没有包产到户、单干的积极性。当包产到户、单干黑风刮到我们这里时，我们就是坚决反对的。旧社会的苦日子我永世也忘不了。解放前，我给地主当了十多年长工，吃的是猪狗食，干的是牛马活。中国赫鲁晓夫要把农业“退够”，要搞包产到户、单干，就是要把旧社会三把刀子——租米、债米、高利贷再架在我们颈子上，就是要把旧社会绑穷人的三条绳子——坐牢、挨饿、上吊捆在我们贫下中农身上，就是要把旧社会的三座大山——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义重压在我们头上。这是万万办不到的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫这个反面教员教育了我们：必须提高阶级警惕，更好地活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠斗头脑里的“私”字，肃清资本主义自发势力的影响，大立“公”字，把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒、批臭，叫他永世不得翻身。
