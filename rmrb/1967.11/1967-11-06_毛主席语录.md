    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    The Soviet Union is the first socialist country, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union is the party created by Lenin. Although the leadership of the party and the state in the Soviet Union has now been usurped by revisionists, I advise comrades to firmly believe that the broad masses of the people, the broad ranks of party members and cadres in the Soviet Union are good and want revolution. The rule of revisionism will not last long.

    毛主席语录 
    苏联是第一个社会主义国家，苏联共产党是列宁创造的党。虽然，苏联的党和国家的领导现在被修正主义者篡夺了，但是，我劝同志们坚决相信，苏联广大的人民、广大的党员和干部，是好的，是要革命的，修正主义的统治是不会长久的。
