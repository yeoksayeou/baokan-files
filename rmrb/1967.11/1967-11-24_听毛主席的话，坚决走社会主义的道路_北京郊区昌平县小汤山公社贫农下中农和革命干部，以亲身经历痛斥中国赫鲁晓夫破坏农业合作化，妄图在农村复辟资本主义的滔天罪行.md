The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Xiaotangshan People's Commune in Changping County, on the outskirts of Beijing, have denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in sabotaging agricultural collectivization and attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside, with their personal experiences, following the publication of the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside."

According to a report from our newspaper, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaotangshan People's Commune in Changping County, on the outskirts of Beijing, enthusiastically welcomed the publication of the article "The Struggle Between the Two Roads in China's Countryside." They angrily denounced the Chinese Khrushchev's heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside. On the afternoon of the 23rd, a group of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres held a meeting to denounce the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev.

Revolutionary mass organization representative Shen Fengming said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we carried out land reform, cooperativization, and eventually established people's communes, leading us onto the broad road to communism. The Chinese Khrushchev, however, sang a different tune from Chairman Mao. He shamelessly advocated "hiring labor, individual farming, and letting things take their natural course," and crazily called for "allowing a few rich peasants to emerge," even claiming that rich peasants with "three horses, one plow, and one cart" should make up 70% of the rural households. This is a thoroughly reactionary and counter-revolutionary fallacy!

"Allowing a few rich peasants to emerge" benefits which class? After land reform, a period of sharp polarization emerged in our area. On one hand, many poor and lower-middle peasants, due to lack of draft animals and tools or natural disasters, had to sell their houses and land. On the other hand, new rich peasants appeared. They not only hired labor and bought land but also used their horses and carts to engage in long-distance transportation and speculative trading.

The facts of our brigade's struggle between the two roads show that developing "three horses, one plow, and one cart" and "allowing a few rich peasants to emerge" is heaven for landlords and rich peasants but a living hell for the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev speaks for the landlords and rich peasants and supports capitalism. Isn't that clear?

Revolutionary cadre Wang Wanfu said: "We have been liberated for nearly twenty years, but the struggle between the two roads has been intense. Soon after the land reform, Chairman Mao called on the poor and lower-middle peasants to 'organize.' He led us onto the socialist road. In 1950, we responded to Chairman Mao's great call and established mutual aid teams everywhere. Later, we set up primary cooperatives. The socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants was extremely high. When we first tried to establish cooperatives, it was stipulated that only one should be set up per district, but the poor and lower-middle peasants set up many cooperatives.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev, this big villain, was frightened by the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. He stood on the side of the bourgeoisie, rich peasants, or rich middle peasants with capitalist tendencies, scheming for the few. He crazily shouted that there were too many cooperatives, that they were 'rushing ahead,' and concocted a reactionary policy of 'stopping, shrinking, and rectifying,' wielding a big knife to hack down cooperatives. Just in our Nankou small district, more than ten were chopped down. This is a heinous crime committed by the Chinese Khrushchev!

At this critical moment in the struggle between the two roads in the countryside, Chairman Mao published the brilliant document "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," severely refuting the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary fallacies and pointing out that cooperatives must 'get on the horse' quickly. Chairman Mao's words struck a chord with us poor and lower-middle peasants. As soon as we learned that Chairman Mao was supporting us in setting up cooperatives, we immediately launched a high tide of agricultural cooperativization. In less than a year, we achieved agricultural cooperativization and embarked on the bright road of socialism. One can imagine that if the Chinese Khrushchev's plot had succeeded, capitalism would definitely have been restored in China's countryside, and bright China would have turned into dark China. What a terrifying scene that would be!

Chen Helin (former Party Secretary of Xiaotangshan People's Commune) said: Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, in 1958, our Xiaotangshan, like other regions, achieved the establishment of people's communes, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants embarked on the bright road to communism.

The emergence of people's communes dealt a heavy blow to the Chinese Khrushchev, who was determined to restore capitalism in China. He was unwilling to admit defeat and sought opportunities to make a desperate struggle. When our country was hit by natural disasters and faced temporary difficulties, the Chinese Khrushchev thought the time had come and eagerly jumped out, spreading the black wind of "three freedoms and one contract," attempting to dismantle the collective economy of people's communes. Under the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev, our commune also saw a serious expansion of private plots. His agents also urged community members to open up wasteland, euphemistically called "filling in the gaps." What "filling in the gaps"? It means sticking a capitalist needle into socialist land! At that time, some landlord and rich peasant elements became active again. They openly shouted, "Fill in the gaps this year, contract production to households next year." They used the pretext of opening up wasteland to level the community's irrigation and drainage channels, seize them as their own "private plots," and seriously damaged the collective economy. This fully exposed that the Chinese Khrushchev and the landlords and rich peasants are on the same path and wear the same pants. Under the influence of this black wind, capitalist spontaneous forces in the countryside also took the opportunity to rise. If this black wind continued to blow, China would indeed change color.

However, the Chinese Khrushchev's calculations went wrong. We, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, quickly saw through the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, resisting the black wind blown by the Chinese Khrushchev. When the Xiaotangshan Brigade discussed contracting land to production teams, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants pointed out sternly: This is a restoration of capitalism, a return to the old road of being exploited by the poor and lower-middle peasants. As a result, the Chinese Khrushchev's plot failed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants made up their minds to follow Chairman Mao on the socialist road and would never turn back.

Yang Yongfu (Captain of the People's Militia Company of Xiaotangshan Brigade) said: The old-fashioned revisionist, the Chinese Khrushchev, opposes our great leader Chairman Mao at every turn. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Under the conditions in our country (in capitalist countries, agriculture is capitalist), cooperativization must come first, and then large machinery can be used." Practice has proven that Chairman Mao's teaching is extremely wise. However, the Chinese Khrushchev said: "Mechanization first, cooperativization later," which is a completely revisionist fallacy. I ask, if it is not a collective economy but individual households as the production unit, with land scattered everywhere, how can machinery be used for production? If cooperativization is not achieved, there will inevitably be polarization in the countryside, and we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer twice, not even able to eat our fill, how can we afford machinery? Today, our brigade has bought many machines, precisely because we first achieved cooperativization, production has greatly developed, and the foundation for agricultural mechanization has been laid.

The purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev's proposal of "mechanization first, cooperativization later" is to obstruct the vigorous cooperativization movement in the countryside and to restore capitalism in the countryside. The "mechanization" he wants is actually the "mechanization" of landlords and rich peasants, allowing landlords and rich peasants to buy machinery and land to exploit the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants again. The Chinese Khrushchev's "mechanization" is a thorough capitalist mechanization based on polarization in the countryside. When this "mechanization" is realized, it will be the day when capitalism is restored in the countryside. The Chinese Khrushchev is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy!

The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary leading cadres who participated in the meeting all expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line in the countryside, eliminate all its poisonous influences, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    听毛主席的话，坚决走社会主义的道路
    北京郊区昌平县小汤山公社贫农下中农和革命干部，以亲身经历痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫破坏农业合作化，妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行
    本报讯　北京郊区昌平县小汤山公社贫农、下中农，热烈欢呼《中国农村两条道路的斗争》一文的发表，愤怒声讨中国赫鲁晓夫妄图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。二十三日下午，部分贫农、下中农和革命干部举行了声讨中国赫鲁晓夫罪行的座谈会。
    革命群众组织代表申凤鸣说：毛主席他老人家领导我们搞土改，搞合作化，一直到办人民公社，使我们走上了通往共产主义的康庄大道。中国赫鲁晓夫却和毛主席大唱反调，肆意鼓吹“雇工，单干，应该放任自流”，“流出点富农来好”，疯狂叫嚣拥有“三马一犁一车”的富农应占农村户数的百分之七十。这真是反动透顶的反革命谬论！
    “流出点富农来”对哪个阶级好？土改以后一段时期，在我们这里迅速出现贫富悬殊的两极分化。一方面广大贫农、下中农因为缺少牲口、农具，或者因为天灾人祸，不少人不得不卖掉房屋、土地；另一方面，新富农出现了。他们不仅雇工、买地，而且利用有马有车的条件，经常出外搞长途运输，搞投机买卖。
    我们队两条道路激烈斗争的事实说明，发展“三马一犁一车”，“流出点富农来”，对于地主、富农当然是好得很，是他们心窝里的天堂；但对于广大贫农、下中农来说，却是活地狱。中国赫鲁晓夫为地主、富农说话，为资本主义帮腔，难道还不清楚吗？
    革命干部王万福说：“我们这里解放快二十年了，但两条道路的斗争始终激烈地进行着。土改刚完，毛主席就号召贫农、下中农“组织起来”，领导我们走社会主义道路。一九五○年，我们响应毛主席的伟大号召，普遍办了互助组，以后接着就办初级社。广大贫农、下中农的社会主义积极性大极了。开始试办合作社，规定一个区只办一个，而贫农、下中农却办了许多合作社。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫这个大坏蛋，被广大贫农、下中农的社会主义积极性吓破了胆。他完全站在资产阶级、富农、或者具有资本主义自发倾向的富裕中农的立场上替较少的人打主意，疯狂叫嚣合作社办多了，“冒进”了，并且炮制了一条“停”、“缩”、“整”的反动方针，挥舞大刀乱砍合作社，仅我们南口小区就被砍去十几个。这是中国赫鲁晓夫犯下的滔天罪行！
    就在这农村两条道路斗争的关键时刻，毛主席发表了《关于农业合作化问题》的光辉文献，严厉驳斥了中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命谬论，指出合作社必须赶快“上马”。毛主席的话，说到了我们贫农、下中农的心坎里。当我们一知道毛主席为我们撑腰，支持我们办社，就立即掀起农业合作化的高潮，在不到一年的时间里，就实现了农业合作化，走上了社会主义的光明大道。可以设想，如果让中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋得逞，资本主义就一定会在中国农村复辟，光明的中国就会变成黑暗的中国。这是多么可怕的情景啊！
    陈贺林（原小汤山公社党委书记）说：在毛主席的领导下，一九五八年，我们小汤山同其他地区一样，实现了人民公社化，广大贫农、下中农走上了通向共产主义的光明大道。
    人民公社的出现，给了一心要在中国复辟资本主义的中国赫鲁晓夫以沉重的打击。他不甘心失败，就寻找机会作垂死的挣扎。在我国遭受自然灾害处于暂时困难时期，中国赫鲁晓夫认为时机已到，急急忙忙跳了出来，大刮“三自一包”的黑风，妄图瓦解人民公社集体经济。在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，我们公社也出现了扩大自留地的严重情况。他的代理人还要社员大量开荒地，美其名曰“见缝插针”。什么“见缝插针”？就是在社会主义的土地上，插上资本主义的针！当时一些地主、富农分子又活跃起来了，他们公开叫嚷“今年见缝插针，明年包产到户”。他们以开荒地为名，把公社的灌水、排水渠道挖平，霸占下来，作为自己的“自留地”，严重地破坏了集体经济。这充分暴露了中国赫鲁晓夫和地主、富农走的是一条路，穿的是一条裤子。在这股黑风的影响下，农村资本主义自发势力也乘机抬头。如果这种黑风继续刮下去，中国真要改变颜色了。
    可是，中国赫鲁晓夫的如意算盘打错了。我们广大贫农、下中农和革命干部，很快就识破了中国赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的阴谋，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，顶住了中国赫鲁晓夫刮的黑风。当小汤山大队讨论把土地包产到组的时候，广大贫农、下中农严正指出：这是复辟资本主义，是要贫农、下中农重新走受剥削的老路。结果，中国赫鲁晓夫的阴谋破产了。广大贫农、下中农下定决心跟毛主席走社会主义大道，绝不走回头路。
    杨永富（小汤山大队民兵连长）说：中国赫鲁晓夫这个老牌修正主义者，处处同我们的伟大领袖毛主席相对抗。毛主席指出：“在我国的条件下（在资本主义国家内是使农业资本主义化），则必须先有合作化，然后才能使用大机器。”实践证明，毛主席这一教导是非常英明的。可是，中国赫鲁晓夫却说：“先机械化，后合作化”，这完全是修正主义的谬论。请问：如果不是集体经济，还是一家一户为生产单位，土地零零散散，怎么使用机械生产？如果不实现合作化，农村必然产生两极分化，我们贫农、下中农还要受二遍苦，连饭都吃不饱，怎能买得起机器？今天，我们大队买了许多机器，就是由于我们先实现了合作化，生产大大发展了，才为农业机械化打下了基础。
    中国赫鲁晓夫提出“先机械化，后合作化”的目的，是为了阻止农村蓬蓬勃勃发展着的合作化运动，是为了在农村复辟资本主义。他要的“机械化”，实际上是地主、富农的“机械化”，让地主、富农买了机器，买了土地，重新剥削广大贫农、下中农。中国赫鲁晓夫的“机械化”是建立在农村两极分化基础上的彻头彻尾的资本主义机械化。这种“机械化”实现之时，就是资本主义在农村复辟之日。中国赫鲁晓夫是我们贫农、下中农的不共戴天的仇敌！
    参加座谈会的贫农、下中农和革命领导干部纷纷表示，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步批判中国赫鲁晓夫在农村的反革命修正主义路线，肃清它的一切流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
