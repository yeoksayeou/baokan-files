	The neighbor of cadre Zhao Xichu has a seven-year-old child. Every time Zhao Xichu returns home from work, the child comes to ask him about the Cultural Revolution in the office. It's either asking if the walking capitalist roaders within the party have been overthrown, or inquiring about the debate between the two revolutionary mass organizations. It turns out that the child knows that Zhao Xichu and his kindergarten teacher are in the same revolutionary mass organization. The child is very happy to hear Zhao Xichu's opinions.

	Later, Zhao Xichu, because of differing opinions with others, withdrew from the original organization. After the seven-year-old child learned of this, he again found Zhao Xichu and asked seriously, "Why did you withdraw from this organization? Isn't the organization that my teacher is in good? If it's not good, then what's not good about it?" He posed a series of questions, almost as if he wanted to debate with Zhao Xichu. Zhao Xichu, while slowly talking with the child, thought: Children in the era of Chairman Mao are so understanding, this is truly "dew and rain nourish the seedlings to make them strong"!

	Recently, this child has also understood the great leader Chairman Mao's call for the people of the entire nation to achieve great unity in revolution. Once again, he found Zhao Xichu and said, "Chairman Mao teaches us not to form factions and to achieve great unity. We should listen to Chairman Mao's words and achieve great unity." Zhao Xichu told the child that the office will soon achieve great unity. The child heard this and was very happy.

    雨露滋润禾苗壮
    机关干部赵锡初的邻居家，有一个刚满七岁的孩子。每当赵锡初下班回家，这孩子就找他问机关文化大革命的事。不是问党内走资派被斗倒了没有，就是问两大革命组织辩论的情况。原来，这孩子知道赵锡初和他幼儿园的阿姨参加了同一个革命群众组织。孩子很乐意听赵锡初的意见。
    后来，赵锡初因为和旁人的意见不同，退出了原来的组织。七岁的孩子知道这件事以后，又找到赵锡初，很正经地问道：“你干嘛要退出这个组织？我阿姨参加的这个组织不好吗？不好在那里？”他提出了一连串的问题，简直要同赵锡初展开辩论啦。赵锡初一面同孩子慢慢谈，一面想：毛泽东时代的儿童这样懂事，这真是“雨露滋润禾苗壮”！
    最近，这孩子又懂得了伟大领袖毛主席号召全国人民搞革命大联合的道理，有一次又找到赵锡初说：“毛主席教导我们不要分派，要大联合，我们要听毛主席的话，搞好大联合才对。”赵锡初告诉孩子：机关很快就要大联合了。孩子听了可高兴啦。　惊涛谈
