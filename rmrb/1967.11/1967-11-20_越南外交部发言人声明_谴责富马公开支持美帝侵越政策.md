Vietnamese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Statement: Condemns Phoumi's Public Support for U.S. Imperialist Aggression in Vietnam

New China News Agency, Hanoi: According to local newspaper reports, the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued a statement on the 11th, condemning Phoumi's recent trip to the United States and Australia, where he publicly supported U.S. imperialism's aggressive policies against Vietnam.

The statement points out that Phoumi's support for the U.S.'s brutal aggression against Vietnam and Laos is a betrayal of the national interests of Laos and a manifestation of hostility towards the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and opposition to the Vietnamese people's national liberation cause. It further indicates that Phoumi has gone further down the path of abandoning the policy of peace and neutrality.

The statement points out that Phoumi's despicable actions run counter to the tide of the world's people opposing U.S. aggression in Vietnam and Laos and will inevitably face severe condemnation from the people of Laos and international public opinion.
