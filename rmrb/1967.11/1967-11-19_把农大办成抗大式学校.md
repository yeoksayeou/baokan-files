Editor's Note: "The school system should be shortened, and education should be revolutionized." This is the battle cry issued by our great leader Chairman Mao.

Recently, the editorial department of this newspaper held a symposium on the issue of educational revolution, attended by revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers from some institutions in Beijing. At the meeting, everyone used a large amount of facts to expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in promoting the revisionist educational line and to reveal the various ills caused by the old educational system.

Our country's old educational system is permeated with the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. Some students, from elementary school to university, spend sixteen or seventeen years, more than twenty years, without seeing rice, wheat, beans, millet, or sorghum, without seeing how workers work, without seeing how farmers cultivate, and even do not understand what class is and what exploitation is. At the same time, due to too many courses and sudden exams, some students' bodies are exhausted. How can such an educational system cultivate successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution?

The economic base has changed, and the educational system, as part of the superstructure, must also change and undergo thorough reform. Revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line, thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line represented by Chinese Khrushchev, and carry the proletarian educational revolution to the end!

Turn the Agricultural University into an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University

Beijing Agricultural University  Yín Xiàngqún

The seventeen-year history of the Agricultural University is a history of the struggle between the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration of the proletariat. Several educational revolutions in the history of the Agricultural University were either strangled to death or led astray by reformism. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our school colluded with the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie to vigorously resist Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They opposed Chairman Mao's teaching on "critically absorbing foreign culture" and put forward the reactionary slogan of "first transplanting then assimilating," "first dogmatism then combining with practice," and implemented "complete Sovietization" in our school. They paid lip service to but acted against Chairman Mao's instructions, strangling the educational revolution of our school in 1958. They also used the banner of half-work and half-study to peddle the junk of "two educational systems."

Under the control of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our school, the old Agricultural University was a big dyeing vat of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, a place to cultivate spiritual aristocrats and privileged classes. On the podium of a socialist university, the bourgeois masters were rampant and poisoned at will. Many children of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants were considered "incapable of being made" and were excluded. Teaching was seriously detached from proletarian politics, from the class struggle of society, and from the actual production of agriculture. Some graduates, due to being corrupted by bourgeois ideology, yearned for big cities and were unwilling to go to the countryside, regarding studying at the Agricultural University as a ladder for them to climb up. The proletarian cultural revolution over the past year has made us deeply realize that: in the past, because power was in the hands of bourgeois intellectuals and their agents within the party, they could carry out dictatorship over the proletariat. Today, we must "carry out the proletarian educational revolution, relying on the broad revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the school, relying on the activists among them, that is, the proletarian revolutionary faction determined to carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end." Otherwise, the educational revolution will be aborted, and "capitalist restoration will be possible at any time." Just when classes resumed, didn't some bourgeois professors shake their heads and try to seize power, saying: "Politics is up to you, and business is up to us"!

According to Chairman Mao's instructions on "no construction without destruction" and "destruction is criticism," a wave of great criticism and great debate has formed in our school. Dozens of preliminary plans to reform our country's agricultural educational system have been put forward one after another. These plans have a common idea: the most important thing is to make Mao Zedong Thought the main course, to take "criticize and repudiate revisionism" as the guiding principle, to teach well the main course of the class struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in our socialist countryside, to make oneself a propagandist of Mao Zedong Thought serving the five hundred million peasants, and to become a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

We are closely following Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment, vigorously promoting the study of Mao Zedong Thought, and deeply criticizing the old educational system with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. We are determined to turn the Agricultural University into an Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

专栏：

    编者按：“学制要缩短，教育要革命”。这是我们伟大领袖毛主席发出的战斗号召。
    最近，本报编辑部就教育革命问题，召开了一个由北京市部分院校革命的学生、革命的教员和革命的工人参加的座谈会。会上，大家用大量的事实，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义教育路线的罪行，揭露了旧教育制度所造成的种种恶果。
    我国旧的教育制度，浸透了封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的毒素。有的学生甚至从小学到大学，一共十六、七年，二十多年看不见稻、粱、菽、麦、黍、稷，看不见工人怎样做工，看不见农民怎样种田，更不懂得什么是阶级，什么是剥削。同时，由于课程太多，考试搞“突然袭击”，有的学生身体也累坏了。这样的教育制度，怎能培养出无产阶级革命事业的接班人呢？
    经济基础变了，作为上层建筑的一部分的教育制度也要变，也要彻底改革。广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持毛主席的无产阶级教育路线，彻底摧毁以中国赫鲁晓夫为总代表的修正主义教育路线，把无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    把农大办成抗大式学校
    北京农业大学　尹向群
    农业大学十七年的历史，是一部资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的斗争史。农大历史上的几次教育革命，或者被活生生地扼杀，或者被拉上改良主义的邪路。中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我校的代理人，勾结资产阶级反动学术“权威”，竭力抵制毛主席的无产阶级教育革命路线。他们对抗毛主席关于“批判地吸收外国文化”的教导，提出了“先搬后化”，“先教条主义后结合实际”的反动口号，在我校实行“全盘苏化”。他们对毛主席的指示阳奉阴违，扼杀了我校一九五八年的教育大革命。他们还打着半农半读的招牌，贩卖所谓“两种教育制度”的破烂货。
    在中国赫鲁晓夫及其在我校的代理人的把持下，旧农大是一个封、资、修的大染缸，是培养精神贵族、特权阶层的场所。在社会主义大学的讲台上，资产阶级老爷们飞扬跋扈，任意放毒。不少工人、贫下中农子弟被他们认为“不可造就”而遭到排斥。教学严重地脱离无产阶级政治，脱离社会的阶级斗争，脱离农业生产实际。有些毕业生由于受到资产阶级思想的腐蚀，留恋大城市，不愿到农村去，把上农大当成自己往上爬的阶梯。一年多来的无产阶级文化大革命，使我们深刻地体会到：过去，正因为权掌握在资产阶级知识分子及其党内代理人的手里，他们才能够对无产阶级实行专政。今天我们“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派”。否则，教育革命就会夭折，“资本主义复辟将是随时可能的”。刚刚复课的时候，不就有资产阶级教授摇头晃脑，想伸手夺权，胡说什么：“政治靠你们，业务靠我们”！
    根据毛主席关于“不破不立”“破，就是批判”的教导，一个大批判、大辩论的热潮已经在我校形成。数十种改革我国农业教育制度的初步方案，一个接一个地提出来。这些方案有一个共同的思想：最重要的是把毛泽东思想列为主课，以“斗私，批修”为纲，上好我国社会主义农村中两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的阶级斗争这门主课，使自己成为为五亿农民服务的毛泽东思想宣传员，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    我们正紧跟毛主席的伟大战略部署，大办毛泽东思想学习班，狠抓“斗私，批修”，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想继续深入批判旧教育制度，坚持边教边改，决心把农大办成抗大式的学校，办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
