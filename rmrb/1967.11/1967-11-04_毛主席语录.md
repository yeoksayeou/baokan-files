	Quotations from Chairman Mao

This means not only studying literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and criticizing the bourgeoisie. The education system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools must no longer be allowed to continue.
