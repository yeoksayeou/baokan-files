    The Chinese Khrushchev, on July 1, 1940, under the pretext of celebrating the Party's birthday, threw out a poisonous weed titled "Be a Good Party Member, Build a Good Party." This is a revisionist party-building black program. It obliterates the proletarian nature of the Party, denies that Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guiding ideology for our Party's construction, and attempts to use bourgeois individualism to reform Party members, turning the Party into a tool for restoring capitalism. We must uproot and thoroughly criticize such a poisonous weed that opposes Mao Zedong Thought.

    The nature of a political party is always determined by its guiding ideology, its political line, principles, and policies, etc. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Our Party, from the very beginning, has been a party based on Marxism-Leninism theory. This is because this ideology is the most correct and revolutionary scientific thought of the proletariat worldwide." The great Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. The Communist Party of China has grown and developed under the nurturing and guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought. It is precisely because we have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as our guide that our Party can advance along the most correct and revolutionary path. However, the Chinese Khrushchev says: "To build the best party... the most basic thing is that we need many good party members." This is a trick played by the Chinese Khrushchev. He avoids mentioning that Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical foundation guiding our Party, thus fundamentally stripping the Party of its soul.

    The history of our Party repeatedly proves this truth: when the Party deviates from the path of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolution fails, the Party shrinks, and retreats; when the Party acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolution wins, the Party develops, and advances. The brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is the fundamental guiding ideology for building a proletarian revolutionary party.

    Our Party is the vanguard of the working class. Communist Party members are the vanguard fighters of the proletariat. The proletarian nature of Communist Party members is very distinct and cannot be blurred.

    Who can join the Communist Party? This is a matter of principle. Our great leader Mao Zedong clearly stipulates in the article "The Position of the Communist Party of China in the National War": "To overcome difficulties, defeat the enemy, and build a new China, the Communist Party must expand its organization, open its doors to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and youth who are truly revolutionary, believe in the Party's ideology, support the Party's policies, are willing to obey discipline, and work hard." However, in his black program, the Chinese Khrushchev says, "Among the exploiters, there are those who understand their future and the historical evolution, especially the young offspring of the exploiters.... They sympathize with or join the progressive revolutionary party, and there are already quite a few." He blatantly blurs the line between the exploiting class and the exploited class, waving his hand to invite landlord and bourgeois elements into our Party.

    Each class always transforms the world according to its own image. The Chinese Khrushchev is a filial son and grandson of the landlord class. He is the one who sneaked into the Communist Party for opportunistic reasons (in his own words, "for his own future"). He tries to recruit Party members according to the demands of the landlord bourgeoisie. Just look at the handful of traitors, opportunists, ambitious plotters, and conspirators within the bourgeois headquarters led by the Chinese Khrushchev; aren't they all a nest of class enemies who have sneaked into the Party? Although they hang the sign of Communist Party members, where is there even a hint of the spirit of proletarian vanguard fighters? It is precisely by using this method of surrendering and recruiting traitors, forming factions, and engaging in nepotism that the Chinese Khrushchev recruits those elements of the exploiting class into the Party, preparing the organizational ground for his usurpation of the Party.

    The surging torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev in broad daylight. The great, invincible, and boundless Mao Zedong Thought will forever be the fundamental guiding ideology for our Party's construction. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's black program for party-building, and ensure that our Party forever advances under the radiant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought!

    建设哪个阶级的“好的党”？
    济南空军某部　红兵
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，在一九四○年七月一日以纪念党的生日为名，抛出了一株《作一个好的党员，建设一个好的党》的大毒草。这是修正主义的建党黑纲领。它抹煞党的无产阶级性质，否认毛泽东思想是我党建设的根本指导思想，妄图用资产阶级个人主义来改造党员，把党变成复辟资本主义的工具。对于这样一株反毛泽东思想的大毒草，我们必须连根铲除，彻底批判。
    一个政党的性质，总是由这个党的指导思想，它的政治路线、方针、政策等等来决定的。毛主席指出：“我们的党从它一开始，就是一个以马克思列宁主义的理论为基础的党，这是因为这个主义是全世界无产阶级的最正确最革命的科学思想的结晶。”伟大的毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的顶峰。中国共产党就是在伟大的毛泽东思想的哺育和指导下成长起来的。正因为有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想作为指南，我们的党才能沿着最正确、最革命的道路前进。然而，中国赫鲁晓夫却说：“建设一个最好的党……最基本的还需要我们有很多很好的党员。”这是中国赫鲁晓夫耍的一个障眼法。他闭口不谈毛泽东思想是指导我们党的理论基础，也就从根本上抽掉了党的灵魂。
    我们党的历史反复地证明了这样一条真理：当党离开毛泽东思想的轨道的时候，革命就失败，党就缩小，倒退；当党按着毛主席的指示办事的时候，革命就胜利，党就发展，前进。光辉灿烂的毛泽东思想，是建设无产阶级革命政党的根本指导思想。
    我们的党，是工人阶级的先锋队。共产党员是无产阶级的先锋战士。共产党员的无产阶级性是十分鲜明，不容模糊的。
    什么人才能参加共产党？这是原则问题。我们伟大领袖毛主席在《中国共产党在民族战争中的地位》一文中明确地规定：“为了克服困难，战胜敌人，建设新中国，共产党必须扩大自己的组织，向着真诚革命、信仰党的主义、拥护党的政策、并愿意服从纪律、努力工作的广大工人农民和青年积极分子开门，使党成为一个伟大的群众性的党。”但是，中国的赫鲁晓夫在他的这个黑纲领中，说什么“剥削者中有明白自己的前途与历史进化的人，尤其是剥削者的青年子弟，……他们为了自己的将来，……同情或加入前进的革命政党，已有不少了”，“他们很对！”他公然混淆剥削阶级与被剥削阶级的界限，招着手请地主资产阶级分子钻到我们党里来。
    每个阶级总是按照自己的面貌来改造世界的。中国的赫鲁晓夫，是地主阶级的孝子贤孙，他就是为了投机（按照他自己的语言则称为“为了自己的将来”）而钻进共产党里来的。他力图按照地主资产阶级的要求来吸收党员。只要看一看以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部内那一小撮叛徒、投机分子、野心家、阴谋家，不都是一窝钻进党里来的阶级异己分子吗？他们虽然挂着共产党员的招牌，但是哪里有丝毫无产阶级先进战士的气味呢？中国赫鲁晓夫正是运用这种招降纳叛、结党营私的办法，吸收那些剥削阶级分子入党，为其篡党作组织准备。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流滚滚向前，中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶面目已经暴露在光天化日之下。伟大的、战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想，永远是我们党的建设的根本指导思想。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的建党黑纲领，使我们党永远在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，胜利前进！
