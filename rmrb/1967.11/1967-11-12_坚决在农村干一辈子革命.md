In 1967, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party came to Xuchang and boasted to the young students about his experience in Party intrigue and climbing up the ladder. He spread the fallacy of "taking advantage as the first generation of peasants." I heard this and had two thoughts: on one hand, I thought his fancy talk of promotion and wealth was harmful and not to be believed; on the other hand, I thought that if I followed his advice to "get along well with the masses," even if I didn't become a big official, I could still gain the support of the people and get a good reputation. With these thoughts, I returned to the front line of agricultural work.

After returning to the countryside, I tried to get along well with the masses and avoided offending people. Even when it came to things that harmed the collective interests, I turned a blind eye, hoping to gain the support of the people. However, the more I did this, the more distant the people became from me. Many poor and lower-middle peasants said I didn't care about the collective, didn't dare to fight, and was a coward. Some said I had a temporary attitude towards the countryside and wasn't on the same wavelength as them. I felt very troubled. Later, I seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. The shining treasure of his books illuminated my heart. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Intellectuals, if they do not integrate with the workers and peasants, will achieve nothing. The final distinction between revolutionary and non-revolutionary or counter-revolutionary intellectuals lies in whether they are willing and able to integrate with the workers and peasants." This made me realize that after going down to the countryside, my mind was full of "selfishness," seeking fame and reputation, and I had not genuinely integrated with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Afterwards, I followed Chairman Mao's instructions, participated in the class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in the countryside with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, sharing their fate and breathing together. In actions and thoughts, I gradually integrated with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Everyone felt that I was one of them, and our relationship became closer, and they trusted me.

In recent years, by combining the actual problems encountered in the countryside with the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, I gradually saw through the evil plots of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party to corrupt the youth. He boasted about "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage," which actually meant making us young people hypocrites, saying one thing in front and another behind. He talked about "going down to the countryside to be farmers" on the surface, but in reality, it was for "promotion and wealth"; he talked about "honestly farming" on the surface, but in reality, it was for "future development." This was completely a case of "hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat." He encouraged us young students to farm for three to five years, not to make us socialist-conscious and cultured laborers, but to let us go down to the countryside to "get some gold plating," to gain capital for promotion and wealth, and to become officials high above the people at a certain time.

Chairman Mao taught us: "The question of training successors to the revolutionary cause of the proletariat... is a matter of life and death for our Party and our country." While the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is doing everything he can to corrupt the youth and is desperately competing with the proletariat for the younger generation, we cannot take this lightly. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly criticize and overthrow the fallacy of "suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage." We must expose the political speculator's face of the Chinese Khrushchev in broad daylight and eliminate his poison. I must resolutely fight against the "selfishness" in my mind, establish the idea of "completely and thoroughly" serving the people, and resolutely follow Chairman Mao to carry out the revolution for a lifetime, farm for the revolution for a lifetime, and be a successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause who is "selfless and dedicated to others."

    坚决在农村干一辈子革命
    河南鄢陵县马栏公社拐子大队五好社员  王国辰
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一九五七年来到许昌，向青年学生吹嘘他搞党内投机，向上爬的臭经验，灌输“当第一代农民讨便宜”的谬论。我听了后，当时有两个看法：一方面认为他讲得天花乱坠的升官发财之道，是害人的，不可信；另一方面认为按照他所说的那样去“搞好群众关系”，即使不当什么大干部，也可以得到群众拥护，落一个好名声。我带着这样的想法回到了农业第一线。
    回乡后，我为了搞好群众关系，平时不去得罪人，甚至对一些危害集体利益的事也不闻不问，希望得到群众的拥护。谁知，我越是这样做，群众越是疏远我。许多贫下中农说我不关心集体，不敢进行斗争，是个胆小鬼。有的说我到农村是临时观点，不和他们一个心眼。我感到很苦恼。后来，我认真学习毛主席著作，金光闪闪的宝书照亮了我的心。毛主席指出：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”这使我认识到自己下乡后由于头脑中充满了“私”字，沽名钓誉，根本没有真心实意和贫下中农结合在一块。以后，我就按照毛主席的指示去做，和广大贫下中农一起参加了农村的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验，和贫下中农同命运、共呼吸，在行动上，思想感情上逐渐和贫下中农结合起来了。大家也感到我是他们中间的一员，同我关系密切了，对我信任了。
    这几年来，结合在农村中遇到的实际问题，活学活用毛主席著作，使我逐渐认清了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派腐蚀青年的罪恶阴谋。他吹嘘“吃小亏，占大便宜”，实际上就是要青年做伪君子，当面一套，背后一套。他表面上讲要我们“下乡当农民”，实质上是为了最后的“升官发财”；表面上讲“老老实实种地”，实质上是为了“将来有大的发展”。这完全是挂羊头卖狗肉。他鼓励我们青年学生下乡种三、五年地，目的不是要我们当个有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，而是让我们下乡去“镀镀金”，捞取升官发财的资本，到一定的时候成为高踞于人民之上的官老爷。
    毛主席教导我们：“培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的问题，……这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派千方百计地腐蚀青年，拚命和无产阶级争夺青年一代，我们决不能等闲视之。我们要以毛泽东思想为武器，彻底批臭批倒“吃小亏，占大便宜”的谬论。把中国赫鲁晓夫的政治投机商面目暴露在光天化日之下，肃清他的流毒。我一定要狠斗头脑里的“私”字，树立“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的思想，坚决跟毛主席干一辈子革命，为革命种一辈子田，誓作“毫不利己专门利人”的无产阶级革命事业接班人。
