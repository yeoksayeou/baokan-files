	Following Chairman Mao's Teaching of Learning War Through War,
	The Palestinian People Actively Wage Guerrilla Warfare

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Baghdad, a young Palestinian military officer recently said in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad: The Palestinian people love Chairman Mao Zedong and his works. Many Palestinians use Chairman Mao's works, taking Mao Zedong Thought as their action guide in the struggle against the aggression of American imperialism and the tool of aggression, Israel.

	The young Palestinian military officer said, the Palestinian people, following Chairman Mao's teachings, are waging guerrilla warfare, striking at the enemy. He said: "Although we lack rich experience in waging guerrilla warfare, we can learn from practice, just as Chairman Mao teaches: 'Learn war through war.'"

	The young Palestinian military officer then recounted the story of their recent successful attack on Israeli aggressors. He said: "One night, thirty Palestinian Liberation Army soldiers in civilian clothes infiltrated a village on the West Bank of the Jordan River controlled by Israel. With the help of local Palestinians, we secretly reconnoitered a power station heavily guarded by Israeli aggressors. The next night, after studying Chairman Mao's quote, 'Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties to strive for victory,' we launched a sudden attack on the enemy, successfully destroying the power station and killing twenty-five Israeli aggressors. We withdrew victoriously, without a single casualty."

	He emphasized that the armed struggle waged by the Palestinian people in the areas occupied by Israel "is the hope for our Palestinian liberation."

	According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Cairo, Cairo newspapers reported that the Arab people in the areas occupied by Israeli aggressors are fearlessly intensifying guerrilla activities, heavily striking at the enemy.

	Recently, Arab guerrillas engaged in a battle with Israeli occupying forces near the village of Tubas on the West Bank of the Jordan River, destroying four Israeli armored vehicles and killing four enemy soldiers. In another battle at the Akabet Jabber camp on the West Bank, guerrillas killed three Israeli soldiers.

    按照毛主席从战争学习战争的教导   
    巴勒斯坦人民积极开展游击战争
    据新华社巴格达电  一位巴勒斯坦青年军官最近在伊拉克首都巴格达说：巴勒斯坦人民热爱毛泽东主席和他的著作。许多巴勒斯坦人运用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想作为他们反对美帝国主义的侵略工具以色列的斗争的行动指南。
    这位巴勒斯坦青年军官说，巴勒斯坦人民按照毛主席的教导，正在开展游击战争，打击敌人。他说：“虽然我们在进行游击战争方面还没有丰富的经验，但是我们可以从实践中学，正如毛泽东主席教导的：‘从战争学习战争’。”
    这位巴勒斯坦青年军官接着讲述了他们不久以前成功地袭击以色列侵略者的故事。他说：“一个夜晚，我们三十名巴勒斯坦解放军战士穿着便衣，渗入了约旦河西岸一个以色列控制的村庄。在当地巴勒斯坦人民的协助下，我们秘密侦察了由以色列侵略军严加守卫的一座发电站。第二天夜晚，在学习了毛主席语录‘下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。’之后，我们对敌人发动了突然袭击，成功地破坏了这座发电站，打死了二十五名以色列侵略者。我们胜利地转移了，没有一人负伤。”
    他强调说，巴勒斯坦人民在以色列侵占区中开展的武装斗争，“是我们巴勒斯坦解放的希望所在”。
    据新华社开罗电　据开罗的报纸报道：被以色列侵略者占领的地区的阿拉伯人民不畏强暴，加紧开展游击活动，沉重打击敌人。
    阿拉伯游击队不久前在约旦河西岸土巴斯村附近同以色列占领军进行了一次战斗，打坏了四辆以色列装甲车，打死四名敌军。在西岸阿卡贝特贾贝尔营地进行的另一次战斗中，游击队打死了三名以色列士兵。
