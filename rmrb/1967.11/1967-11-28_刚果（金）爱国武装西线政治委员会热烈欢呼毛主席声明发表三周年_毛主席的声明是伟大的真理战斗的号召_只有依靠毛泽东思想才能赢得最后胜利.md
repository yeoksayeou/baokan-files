The Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces Western Front Political Committee recently issued a statement on the occasion of the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement "In Support of the People of the Congo (Leopoldville) Against U.S. Aggression." The statement said: "Over a long period, we have been seeking the path for the progress of our national liberation struggle. The experiences and lessons we have gained in the struggle show that only by mastering Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely relying on Mao Zedong Thought can we achieve final victory."

The Congolese (Kinshasa) Patriotic Armed Forces Western Front Political Committee, in a statement titled "Long Live the Third Anniversary of Comrade Mao Zedong's Statement Supporting the Congolese (Kinshasa) People's Struggle Against U.S. Aggression," emphasized: "In our country's revolutionary life, Chairman Mao's statement is a very significant event."

The statement said that the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's statement coincides with the moment when the significant and decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, are being achieved, and with the moment when the Congolese people, oppressed by U.S. imperialism and its lackey Mobutu, have finally found the invincible truth of Mao Zedong Thought.

The statement said that three years ago, Chairman Mao pointed out: "The United States has been trying to control the Congo." The statement continued: "Just as it was three years ago, the U.S. imperialists are today systematically and desperately suppressing our national liberation movement. The modern revisionists, who are the lackeys of U.S. imperialism, are spreading defeatism and creating divisions within our ranks. The U.S. imperialists are firmly supporting their lackey Mobutu and providing his fascist regime with large amounts of military aid: planes, weapons, troops, etc."

The statement emphasized: "We are deeply convinced that the common enemy of the world's peoples, U.S. imperialism, its lackeys, and its lackey Mobutu, relying on bombs, planes, and troops, are completely powerless against our people, who are more determined than ever to arm themselves with the invincible spiritual atomic bomb—Mao Zedong Thought. After quoting Chairman Mao's words 'U.S. imperialism is the common enemy of the peoples of the world,' the statement pointed out: 'Such an imperialist country, which stretches its hands too far, provokes the just indignation of the peoples of various countries, and is insatiable, must perish.' The statement said: 'The active support of our struggle by the great teacher of the world's revolutionaries, Comrade Mao Zedong, deeply moves us, because Chairman Mao, in the statement, on behalf of the 700 million Chinese people, said: 'The just struggle of the Congolese people is not isolated. The entire Chinese people support you.'"

The statement said: "'All the peoples of the world, unite and defeat U.S. aggression and all its lackeys! All the peoples of the world, dare to struggle, dare to win! The people of the whole world will certainly win. All ghosts and monsters will be swept away.' Facing the numerous problems we encounter in our struggle, we have formed the habit of studying and applying this precious dictum from Chairman Mao's statement on the Congolese (Kinshasa) people's struggle. Only those who have no revolutionary practice can fail to understand the profound significance of this call. This part of the statement by the great and most beloved teacher of the international communist movement and the liberation movement is a stirring battle cry, a solemn call to selflessness, sacrifice, and devotion: this is a necessary condition for winning the people's war. We fully support and endorse the historic statement of November 28, 1964, which supports our struggle."

The statement said: "The imperialists led by the United States, the modern revisionists centered around the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and all their lackeys will be eliminated by the peoples of all countries and thrown into the dustbin of history."

The statement concluded with the slogans: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the struggles of the peoples of all countries! Down with U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism! Defend the motherland to the death! We will be victorious!"

    刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会热烈欢呼毛主席声明发表三周年
    毛主席的声明是伟大的真理战斗的号召
    只有依靠毛泽东思想才能赢得最后胜利
    新华社二十六日讯　刚果（金）爱国武装西线政治委员会最近在毛主席《支持刚果（利）人民反对美国侵略的声明》发表三周年之际，发表一项声明说：“在长时期中，我们一直在寻找我们民族解放斗争取得进展的道路。我们在斗争中所取得的经验教训表明，只有掌握毛泽东思想，坚决依靠毛泽东思想，我们才能赢得最后的胜利。”
    刚果（金）——刚果首都利奥波德维尔一九六六年六月改名金沙萨，故刚果（利）改称刚果（金）——爱国武装西线政治委员会在题为《毛泽东同志支持刚果（金）人民反对美国侵略的声明发表三周年万岁》的声明中强调指出：“在我国革命生活中，毛主席的声明是一个意义十分重大的事件。”
    声明说，毛主席的声明发表三周年，“是在毛主席亲自发动和领导的意义重大的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌和决定性的胜利的时刻到来的，是在受美帝国主义及其走狗蒙博托压迫的刚果人民终于找到了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大真理的时刻到来的。”
    声明说，三年前，毛主席就指出：“美国一直企图控制刚果。”声明接着说：“同三年前的情况完全一样，美帝国主义者今天仍在有计划地拚命地镇压我国的民族解放运动，美帝国主义的帮凶现代修正主义者则在我们的队伍中散布失败主义和制造分裂。美帝国主义者坚决地支持他们的走狗蒙博托，并向蒙博托的法西斯政权提供大量军事援助：飞机、武器、军队等。”
    声明强调指出：“我们深信，世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义、它的帮凶以及它的走狗蒙博托靠炸弹、飞机和军队，对比以往任何时候都更加下定决心用具有无比威力的精神原子弹——战无不胜的毛泽东思想——武装起来的我国人民，是完全无能为力的。”声明在引用了毛主席的一句语录“美帝国主义是全世界人民的共同敌人”后指出：“这样一个把手伸得太长的、引起各国人民正义愤怒的、贪得无厌的帝国主义国家一定要灭亡。”声明说：“全世界革命者的伟大导师毛泽东同志对我们的斗争的积极声援，使我们非常感动，因为毛主席在声明中代表七亿中国人民说：‘刚果人民的正义斗争不是孤立的。全中国人民支持你们。’”
    声明说：“‘全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。’面对着我们斗争中所遇到的无数问题，我们养成了学习和运用毛主席关于刚果（金）人民斗争的声明中的这条宝贵的语录的习惯。只有那些没有任何革命实践的人才无法了解这一号召的深刻意义。国际共产主义运动和解放运动的伟大的和最敬爱的导师的声明的这个部分是一个激昂的战斗号召，是要人们毫不利己、充满牺牲和忘我精神的庄严号召：这是取得人民战争胜利的必要条件。我们完全拥护支持我们斗争的一九六四年十一月二十八日的历史性声明。”
    声明说：“以美国为首的帝国主义者、以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者和他们的一切走狗，都将被世界各国人民清除掉，并被扔进历史的垃圾堆里去。”
    声明最后高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“各国人民的斗争万岁！”“打倒美帝国主义和现代修正主义！”“誓死保卫祖国！我们必胜！”
