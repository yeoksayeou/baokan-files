Chairman Ho Chi Minh praised the military and civilians of Hanoi for their glorious victory in shooting down the 2,500th invading U.S. aircraft. He called on the military and civilians to fight bravely and strive for greater victories. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sent a telegram expressing the determination of the southern military and civilians to overcome all difficulties and hardships and fight to the end.

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) — According to reports from here, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on Nov. 7 to the military and civilians of Hanoi, praising them for their glorious victory in shooting down the 2,500th invading U.S. aircraft.

	In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh pointed out that the shooting down of the 2,500th U.S. aircraft by the military and civilians of Hanoi shows that the U.S. aggressors have once again been punished by the military and civilians of Hanoi.

	Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in his letter of praise: "I am very pleased to praise the comrades of Hanoi, the soldiers and cadres of the armed forces for their vigilance, unity, bravery, and intelligence in fighting, and for achieving a glorious victory."

	Chairman Ho Chi Minh called on them, saying: "The military and civilians of Hanoi must be vigilant, be prepared at all times, and launch a competition to achieve good results in both combat and production, striving for more and greater victories."

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 6 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency, Chairman Ho Chi Minh wrote a letter on Nov. 4 to the military and civilians of Nghe An Province, congratulating them on having shot down a total of 300 U.S. aircraft by Nov. 2.

	Chairman Ho Chi Minh said in his letter that the victory of the military and civilians of Nghe An Province has made a valuable contribution to the common victory of the entire Vietnamese nation.

	Chairman Ho Chi Minh said that although the U.S. aggressors have suffered a great defeat, they are still plotting many schemes. He said, "The struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation still faces many difficulties, but it will definitely be victorious."

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) — According to reports from here, the General Staff of the Vietnam People's Army issued a communiqué on Nov. 7, warmly hailing the brilliant victory of the military and civilians of North Vietnam in shooting down 2,500 invading U.S. aircraft.

	The communiqué called on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to press forward and strike hard at the U.S. aggressors, seizing greater victories.

	The communiqué said that after suffering a severe defeat in the South Vietnamese battlefield during the 1966-1967 winter and spring seasons, the U.S. aggressors, in order to save their extremely desperate situation, have escalated the war against North Vietnam to an extremely serious level and committed extremely barbaric crimes. However, all the U.S. aggressors' war escalations have been thwarted by the military and civilians of North Vietnam. The places where they launched the fiercest attacks are also the places where they suffered the heaviest defeats.

	The communiqué said: "The great victories achieved by our military and civilians in the South and North further prove that no matter how stubborn and brutal the U.S. aggressors are, they cannot escape defeat. The more frantically they escalate the war, the more they expose their passive and weak position, and the more heavily they suffer defeat."

	The communiqué pointed out that although the U.S. aggressors have suffered heavy defeats, they still do not give up their aggressive ambitions and will play many tricks and schemes. However, "no matter what bombs and weapons the U.S. aggressors use, they cannot threaten our people. None of their tricks can deceive us. The determination of our 31 million compatriots to thoroughly defeat the U.S. aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, and ultimately reunify the country is unshakable."

	NEW DELHI, Nov. 8 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam, the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam sent a telegram on Nov. 6 to the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, warmly congratulating the military and civilians of North Vietnam on shooting down 2,500 invading U.S. aircraft.

	The telegram said that the glorious victory of the North Vietnamese military and civilians is not only a well-deserved punishment for the war policy of the Johnson clique but also proves that no matter how brutal the war methods and tools used by U.S. imperialism, they cannot conquer the fighting will of the Vietnamese people.

	The telegram condemned the recent rehashing of the "peace talks" by the Johnson administration. The telegram said that all the cunning schemes and tricks of U.S. imperialism only further expose its robber face.

	The telegram finally expressed that the people and various armed forces of the South will overcome all difficulties and hardships, fear no sacrifice, and fight resolutely to the end.

    越南南方民族解放阵线的贺电表示南方军民决心克服一切艰难困苦坚决战斗到底
    新华社河内八日电  据这里报纸报道，胡志明主席七日写信给河内军民，表扬他们取得击落第二千五百架入侵的美国强盗飞机的辉煌胜利。
    胡主席在信中指出，河内军民击落第二千五百架美国飞机表明，美国强盗再一次遭到了河内军民的应有惩罚。
    胡志明主席在表扬信中说：“我十分高兴地表扬河内同胞、武装力量的战士和干部们提高警惕、紧密团结、勇敢机智地进行战斗，取得了辉煌胜利。”
    胡主席号召说：“河内军民必须提高警惕，随时作好准备，大力展开竞赛，做到战斗好，生产好，争取更多更大的胜利。”
    新华社河内六日电据越南通讯社报道，胡志明主席四日写信给义安省军民，祝贺他们到十一月二日为止，一共打下了三百架美国强盗飞机。
    胡志明主席在信里说，义安省军民的这个胜利，对越南全国的共同胜利“做出了有价值的贡献”。
    胡主席说，美国侵略者已经遭到大败，但是仍然在策划许多阴谋。他说：“抗美救国斗争还面临着不少困难，然而必定会胜利。”
    新华社河内八日电据这里报纸报道，越南人民军总司令部七日发表公报，热烈欢呼越南北方军民共击落入侵的美国强盗飞机两千五百架的光辉胜利。
    公报号召越南北方军民乘胜前进，狠打美国侵略者，夺取更大的胜利。
    公报说，美国强盗自一九六六——一九六七年冬春季在越南南方战场上遭到惨败以后，为了挽救他们走投无路的极其窘迫的处境，对北方进行极其严重的战争“升级”，犯下了极其野蛮的罪行。但是，美国强盗的一切战争“升级”都被越南北方军民挫败了。他们袭击最猛烈的地方，也就是他们遭到最惨重失败的地方。
    公报说：“我们南北两方军民所取得的巨大胜利进一步证明：无论美国侵略强盗多么顽固和残暴，他们是摆脱不了失败的命运的。他们越疯狂地加强战争，就越暴露他们的被动和虚弱的处境，就越遭到惨重的失败。”
    公报指出，美国强盗虽然遭到了惨重的失败，但还不肯放弃他们的侵略野心，还要玩弄许多阴谋和诡计。但是，“美国强盗的任何一种炸弹和武器，都威胁不了我国人民。他们的任何一种狡诈手段，都欺骗不了我们。我们三千一百万同胞彻底战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的决心是不可动摇的。”
    新华社河内八日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会六日打电报给越南祖国战线中央委员会，热烈祝贺越南北方军民击落入侵的美国强盗飞机两千五百架。
    电报说，北方军民的这一辉煌胜利，不但是对约翰逊集团战争政策的应有惩罚，而且还证明了美帝国主义无论使用多么残暴的战争手段和工具，都无法征服越南民族的战斗意志。
    电报谴责了约翰逊政府最近又重弹“和平谈判”的骗人老调。电报说，美帝国主义的所有狡诈的阴谋和手段，更加暴露了它的强盗面目。
    电报最后表示，南方人民和各种人民解放武装力量决心克服一切艰难困苦，不怕牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利。
