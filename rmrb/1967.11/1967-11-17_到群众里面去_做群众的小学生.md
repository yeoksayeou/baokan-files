Chairman Mao recently instructed us: "We must properly handle the relationship between superiors and subordinates, and between cadres and the masses. In the future, cadres should go down to the grassroots to have a look, to persist in the mass line, to consult with the masses on all matters, and to be students of the masses. In a certain sense, those who are the wisest and most talented are the soldiers with the most practical experience."

Chairman Mao's latest instruction, upon reaching the Beijing Knitting Factory, brought joy and excitement to all revolutionary workers and PLA leftist support personnel. The factory revolutionary committee members and PLA leftist support personnel immediately conducted a study session and discussion. The members of the factory revolutionary committee and the PLA leftist support personnel unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's words, to persist in the mass line, to consult with the masses on all matters, and to be forever students of the masses.

Forever Not Detached from the Masses

Members of the Beijing Knitting Factory Revolutionary Committee and PLA leftist support personnel unanimously agreed during the discussion that Chairman Mao's latest instruction has extremely important practical and historical significance. Leftist support personnel Li Kaijun said: Chairman Mao's latest instruction points the way for the ideological revolution of all revolutionary cadres, showing the greatest concern, encouragement, and exhortation for us. Countless facts prove that the attitude towards the masses is a crucial indicator distinguishing true revolutionaries from false ones, and a dividing line between those who genuinely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and those who stand on the side of the bourgeois reactionary line. We must follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, always maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the working people, and never detach ourselves from the masses. Deputy Director of the Factory Revolutionary Committee (former Deputy Director) Zhang Chengming said with deep emotion: The fundamental reason for my past mistakes was that I did not thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's works and did not correctly treat the masses. Before the Cultural Revolution, due to my detachment from the masses, my thoughts and feelings changed, and I gradually lost the character of a laboring people, unable to treat class brothers with sincere enthusiasm, often scolding workers. During the Cultural Revolution, it was also because I could not correctly treat the masses that I once implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Later, with the patient help of PLA comrades and worker comrades, I studied Chairman Mao's works and truly realized in my thoughts that the masses' criticism was a sincere help to me. Only then did I eliminate my antagonistic feelings towards the masses and return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. I deeply felt that if a person detaches himself from the masses, he will detach himself from the revolution, and even oppose the revolution. To forever maintain revolutionary youth, one must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and never detach oneself from the masses. Dyeing worker and Deputy Director of the Revolutionary Committee Xing Yun said with fervent emotion: Chairman Mao's latest instruction speaks directly to our hearts. I, an ordinary worker, was selected to join the revolutionary three-in-one leadership team, which is the greatest trust the masses have placed in me. How should I proceed in the future? Chairman Mao has timely pointed out the direction for us. Seriously studying and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's latest instruction is a major issue concerning the healthy growth of tens of thousands of revolutionary successors and a major issue concerning the prevention of revisionism and ensuring that our country will never change color.

Forever United with the Masses

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the creation of world history." "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant. Not understanding this point, one cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." Members of the factory revolutionary committee and PLA leftist support personnel said in the discussion: Chairman Mao's latest instruction most fully embodies Chairman Mao's belief in the masses and reliance on the masses. Leftist support personnel Wang Defu said, since we entered the factory, countless facts have proven that revolutionary masses love Chairman Mao the most, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and understand Chairman Mao's revolutionary line the most. They harbor immense revolutionary enthusiasm, boundless wisdom, and strength. Relying on the masses, everything is easy; without the masses, one cannot take a single step. After Chairman Mao's latest instruction on revolutionary unity was issued, the masses of the two revolutionary mass organizations took the initiative to urge their leaders to level the mountains, expose the crimes of factionalism, and promote the benefits of great unity, quickly achieving revolutionary unity. Some cadres had reservations about going among the masses to show themselves, but the masses of each workshop enthusiastically sent encouraging letters to the cadres, drumming and cheering, helping the cadres, and promoting the revolutionary three-in-one combination. All revolutionary workers in the factory seized the revolution and promoted production, creating the highest production level since the factory's establishment in October. These facts fully demonstrate that the people have limitless creative power, and once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses, it can transform everything and create everything.

In the discussion, everyone unanimously pointed out that to persist in the mass line, one must first firmly establish the mass viewpoint and have deep class feelings towards the masses. Cutting worker and Revolutionary Committee member Yang Huanzhang said: Over the past year of the Cultural Revolution, I deeply felt that to improve the relationship between cadres and the masses, one must have class feelings, care about the masses' hardships, care about the masses' lives, and be united with the masses. The other day, revolutionary performers from the Beijing garrison troops came to our factory for a performance. We thought of the workers in the canteen and nursery, who are the hardest working and most tired, and let them sit in the front during the performance. The masses were very moved, saying: Before the Cultural Revolution, every time we watched a play, the cadres always sat in the front, and we either stood on the side or at the back. Now it's the opposite. Although the matter is small, it shows that the relationship between cadres and the masses has fundamentally changed. That day, although we stood at the back to watch the performance, our hearts were very happy. We are even closer to the masses. This incident made me further understand that a revolutionary cadre must always think of the masses to forever be united with the masses.

Be a Lifelong Ordinary Laborer

Participants in the discussion pointed out that to be a good cadre of the people, one must first be an ordinary laborer. Revolutionary cadres are servants of the people and must always regard the revolutionary masses as their teachers and regard themselves as students who have not yet graduated. Standing Committee member of the Revolutionary Committee (former chairman of the factory union) Cong Zepu said: Chairman Mao has long taught us: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective productive labor. Our party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not overlords who sit on the heads of the people." Before the Cultural Revolution, I did not follow Chairman Mao's instructions well. After becoming the chairman of the factory union, I thought I was great, worked less, went among the masses less, and spoke less to the masses, mistakenly believing that being a cadre means having a 'dignity.' Therefore, the masses were angry, and during the Cultural Revolution, the masses attacked me, which was good. If they had not attacked, it would have been dangerous! During the study of Mao Zedong Thought, we studied Chairman Mao's latest teachings, carrying the 'Criticize and Repudiate' slogan cards, going among the workers to widely solicit opinions. The first time I went, an old worker said to me with deep emotion: "Comrade Cong, you have changed!" I said: "I am still the same, not fat or thin." He said: "You have not changed in appearance, but you have become an official, and your feelings have changed." His words hit the mark, waking me up. From then on, I often went down, and whoever had opinions about me, I would seek their advice. Not long ago, I went down again to solicit opinions, and a worker said to me: "This time you came is much more cordial than before. Before the Cultural Revolution, you came, swaying, putting on a big cadre's air, pointing and gesturing, and we had words we did not dare to say to you. Like this time, we are willing to say anything to you. We workers do not hope for this or that from you, we just hope you will listen to Chairman Mao's words, get rid of the stink of officialdom, and forever be with us." This is the revolutionary masses' expectation of me, and it is also an exhortation to me. I must forever learn from the revolutionary masses and be an ordinary laborer for life. Technician and Revolutionary Committee member Wang Shen said: Now our status has changed, but our thoughts must never change. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, forever be students of the masses, forever struggle with the masses to criticize and repudiate, and together with the revolutionary masses, turn the factory into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    到群众里面去　做群众的小学生
    ——北京针织总厂新老革命干部和解放军支左人员热烈座谈毛主席最新指示
    毛主席最近教导我们：“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系。以后干部要分别到下面去走一走，看一看，要坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，做群众的小学生。在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”
    毛主席的这一最新指示，传到北京针织总厂，全厂革命职工和解放军支左人员，个个欢欣鼓舞，立即进行学习座谈。厂革命委员会成员和解放军支左人员，在学习和座谈中，一致表示坚决听毛主席的话，坚持群众路线，遇事多和群众商量，永远做群众的小学生。
    永远不脱离群众
    北京针织总厂革命委员会成员和解放军支左人员在座谈中一致认为：毛主席的最新指示，具有极其重大的现实意义和深远的历史意义。支左人员李开军说：毛主席的最新指示，给全体革命干部的思想革命化指出了方向，是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策。无数事实证明，对群众采取什么态度，是当人民的勤务员，还是当官做老爷，这是区别真革命和假革命的重要标志，是认真执行毛主席的革命路线还是站在资产阶级反动路线一边的分水岭。我们一定要遵照毛主席的伟大教导，永远同劳动人民保持最广泛最经常最密切的联系，永远不要脱离群众。厂革命委员会副主任（原副厂长）张成明深有感触地说：我过去犯错误，最根本的原因，就是没有很好活学活用毛主席著作，没有正确对待群众。在文化大革命以前，由于脱离群众，思想感情上有了变化，劳动人民的本色越来越少，不能以满腔热忱对待阶级兄弟，常常训斥工人。文化大革命中，也是因为不能正确对待群众，一度执行了资产阶级反动路线。后来我在解放军同志和工人同志的耐心帮助下，学习了毛主席著作，真正从思想上认识到群众的批评是对我的热忱帮助。这样，我才消除了和群众的对立情绪，回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。我深深体会到，一个人如果脱离了群众，就会脱离革命，甚至反对革命。要想永葆革命青春，就必须遵照毛主席的教导，永远不脱离群众。漂染工人、厂革委会副主任邢云有满怀激情地说：毛主席的最新指示，字字句句说到了我们的心坎里。我由一个普通工人被选到革命三结合的领导班子里，这是群众对我的最大信任。今后的路子怎么走，毛主席他老人家又及时地给我们指明了前进方向。认真学习、坚决执行毛主席的最新指示，是关系到成千成万的革命接班人健康成长的大问题，是关系到反修防修保证我们的祖国永不变色的大问题。
    永远和群众心连心
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”厂革命委员会成员和解放军支左同志在座谈中说：毛主席的最新指示，最充分地体现了毛主席最相信群众，最依靠群众。支左人员王德福说，我们进厂以来，无数事实证明，革命群众最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，最理解毛主席的革命路线。他们中间蕴藏着巨大的革命积极性，蕴藏着无穷无尽的智慧和力量。依靠群众，事事好办；离开群众，寸步难行。毛主席关于革命大联合的最新指示一发表，两个革命群众组织的群众，纷纷起来促头头，平山头，大列派性的罪状，大摆大联合的好处，很快实现了革命大联合。一些干部对到群众中去亮相有顾虑，各车间群众敲锣打鼓地给干部送鼓励信，热情帮助干部，促进了革命的三结合。全厂革命职工抓革命、促生产，十月份创造了建厂以来的最高生产水平。这些事实充分说明，人民群众有无限的创造力，毛泽东思想一旦为亿万革命群众所掌握，就能改造一切，创造一切。
    在座谈中大家一致指出，坚持群众路线首先必须牢固地树立群众观点，对待群众要有深厚的阶级感情。裁剪工人、厂革委会委员杨焕章说：一年多来的文化大革命，使我深深体会到，要搞好干部和群众的关系，一定要怀着阶级感情，关心群众疾苦，关心群众生活，和群众心连心。前些日子，驻京部队无产阶级革命派文艺战士来我厂演出。我们想到食堂和托儿所的工人最辛苦，最累，演出时就让他们坐在前面。群众很受感动，说：文化大革命以前，每次看戏，总是干部坐在前面，我们不是溜边儿就是靠后站，现在倒了个个儿。事情虽小，却说明现在的干部和群众的关系已经发生了根本变化。这一天，我们虽然站在后面看演出，心里却很高兴。我们和群众的心贴得更紧了。这件事使我进一步懂得，一个革命干部只有处处想着群众，才能永远和群众心连心。
    当一辈子普通劳动者
    参加座谈的同志指出，要当人民的好干部，首先应该是一个普通的劳动者。革命干部是人民的勤务员，要永远把革命群众当作自己的老师，永远把自己当作未毕业的小学生。厂革委会常委（原厂工会主席）丛泽普说：毛主席早就教导我们：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。”文化大革命以前，我没有很好地照毛主席的指示去做，当了厂工会主席后，就自以为了不起，劳动少了，到群众里去少了，见了群众话也少了，错误地认为，当干部就要有干部的“派头”。因此，群众有气，在文化大革命中，群众冲了我，冲得好，要是不冲，那可真危险！在毛泽东思想学习班学习的时候，我们学习了毛主席的最新教导，扛着“斗私，批修”的语录牌，到工人中间去广泛征求意见。第一次去，一位老工人语重心长地对我说：“老丛啊，你变了！”我说：“我胖瘦还是这样，没变呀！”他说：“你不是模样变了，是官做大了，感情变了。”一句话打中我的要害，使我猛醒过来。从此以后，我经常下去，谁对我有意见，我就向谁请教。前不久，我又下去征求意见，一位工人对我说：“你这次来就比过去亲切多了，文化大革命以前，你来了，摇摇晃晃，摆出一副大干部的派头，指手划脚，我们有话也不给你说。象现在这样子，我们有什么话都愿对你说。我们工人对你们不希望这，不希望那，就希望你们好好听毛主席的话，丢掉臭官架子，永远和我们在一起。”这是革命群众对我的期望，也是对我的鞭策。我一定要永远向革命群众学习，当一辈子普通劳动者。技术员、厂革命委员会委员王慎说：现在我们的地位变了，思想永远不能变。我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，永远做群众的小学生，永远和群众一起斗私批修，和革命群众一道，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
