The seas and skies are in turmoil, and the winds and thunder roar across the continents. Humanity has entered an era where imperialism is heading towards total collapse, and socialism is marching towards global victory. It is also the era of the great thought of Mao Zedong.

In this great era, there are two banners in the world. One is the bright red banner of revolution held high by our great leader Chairman Mao. The proletariat and all revolutionary people of the world are rallying under this banner to advance towards victory. The other is the black banner of counter-revolution supported by American imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique, under which all imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries from various countries are gathering to make their last-ditch struggle. If you are a revolutionary, a Marxist-Leninist, you must support our great leader Chairman Mao and the invincible thought of Mao Zedong; if you are a counter-revolutionary, an anti-Marxist-Leninist, you must oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought.

The attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought in this great era has become the most reliable touchstone and dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution, genuine revolution and false revolution, Marxism-Leninism and counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The clique within the party led by the Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road, in order to serve their counter-revolutionary restoration plot, fiercely opposes our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and viciously attacks the invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The bourgeois conspirator and opportunist Luo Ruiqing is an important member of the bourgeois headquarters hidden within the party, a representative of the Chinese Khrushchev. His fundamental crime is that, for a long time, he has followed the instructions of the Chinese Khrushchev to maliciously slander Chairman Mao, attack and distort Mao Zedong Thought, oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, oppose Chairman Mao's military thought, and oppose the establishment of the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He attempts to transform our proletarian army into a bourgeois army. We must use the most powerful weapon, Mao Zedong Thought, to thoroughly expose, criticize, and overthrow the political, ideological, and theoretical crimes of the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their representative Luo Ruiqing, and completely eliminate their poisonous influence. In the great criticism of the revolution, we must uphold the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong.

Upholding the Absolute Authority of the Great Leader Chairman Mao, Defending Chairman Mao's Supreme Leadership Position

Marxist-Leninists have always believed that a proletarian revolutionary party must be led by the most authoritative and experienced great leader to accomplish the great cause of communism. Lenin pointed out: "The working class, in order to carry out a difficult and tenacious struggle on a global scale to achieve complete liberation, needs authority. ... Every proletarian needs the authority of the global proletarian struggle." He also said, "Cultivating a group of experienced and highly authoritative party leaders is a long and arduous task. But without this, proletarian dictatorship, the 'unity of will' of the proletariat, will become an empty phrase."

Our red sun, Chairman Mao, is the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman of the Chinese and global proletariat and revolutionary people, chosen through long-term revolutionary practice. He is the authority of the global proletarian struggle in the contemporary era. He possesses the most steadfast and thorough proletarian revolutionary spirit and the most ingenious and flexible art of struggle. He has profound Marxist-Leninist wisdom and rich experience in struggle. He trusts the masses the most, cares for the masses the most, and supports the revolutionary movements of the masses the most, being heart-to-heart with the revolutionary masses. He has the highest prestige in all of China and the world. He has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage. Comrade Lin Biao has consistently and wholeheartedly upheld the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Lin Biao has given the most correct, most scientific, and most sublime Marxist-Leninist evaluation of the boundless thought of Mao Zedong. For decades, he has loyally defended, executed, and propagated the great thought of Mao Zedong, bravely defending Chairman Mao's supreme leadership position. He pointed out: Chairman Mao is the representative of our era, the representative of the party, the representative of the masses, the representative of the proletariat, the leader of the masses, the soul of the masses. Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the most outstanding leader of the proletariat, the greatest genius.

Luo Ruiqing, this bourgeois representative who has infiltrated the party, driven by his counter-revolutionary class instinct, has long opposed our great leader Chairman Mao. As early as the Second Revolutionary Civil War, he was a follower of the Wang Ming line. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he was a co-conspirator in Peng Dehuai's anti-party activities. After the national liberation, he participated in the conspiracy of the Peng, Gao, Rao anti-party alliance. As the socialist revolution deepened, his opposition to Chairman Mao became more intense. The Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world love Chairman Mao dearly, but Luo Ruiqing shamelessly and viciously attacks Chairman Mao, attacks Mao Zedong Thought, attacks Chairman Mao's great genius, and attacks the party's general line, the Great Leap Forward, and the people's communes. Such despicable attacks are precisely his collusion with the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries in their frenzied anti-China activities, attempting to incite a counter-revolutionary tide within the country against the party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought! It is precisely his attempt to carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism, revealing his counter-revolutionary revisionist face!

Marxists have always valued the personal genius of proletarian leaders and consider it an important aspect to be considered in the selection of leaders. Not seeing this point, one cannot choose the greatest proletarian helmsman as one's leader. Engels highly praised Marx's great genius, saying: "We owe everything to him. The success of the modern movement is due to his theoretical and practical activities. Without him, we would still be wandering in the dark." Lenin also said that one needs ten or more genius leaders to lead the Russian revolution to victory. Chairman Mao's speeches, writings, and revolutionary practices all demonstrate his great proletarian genius. He has solved a series of major theoretical and practical problems facing the contemporary communist movement, reaching the highest peak in the development of Marxism. He stands the highest, sees the farthest, and is the best at leading the revolutionary struggles of the masses to victory in the most complex and difficult situations. Comrade Lin Biao said: A genius like Chairman Mao appears once every few hundred years in the world and once every few thousand years in China. Chairman Mao is the greatest genius in the world.

After the 20th Congress of the CPSU, Luo Ruiqing opposed the idea of "promoting individual genius," specifically stating that he opposed "promoting individual genius again." This exposed him as a fervent follower and loyal disciple of Khrushchev's "opposition to the cult of personality." He used Khrushchev's methods of opposing Stalin to oppose our great leader Chairman Mao.

In the history of the international communist movement, using slogans like "opposing the cult of personality" to slander proletarian leaders and sabotage proletarian causes is a common trick of old and new revisionists. In the era of the First International, the conspirator Bakunin used such slogans to curse Marx. In the era of the Second International, the traitor Kautsky used such slogans to curse Lenin. In the era of the Third International, the traitor Trotsky used such slogans to curse Stalin. The modern revisionist clique of Khrushchev used such slogans to fiercely oppose Stalin, seizing the leadership of the Soviet party and state. Towards the greatest Marxist-Leninist of contemporary times, our great leader Chairman Mao, they are even more unscrupulous in using such slogans to attack him. Luo Ruiqing, following the instructions of the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our country, in tandem with the modern revisionist clique of Khrushchev, also uses such slogans to viciously slander and oppose the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world, Chairman Mao. This fully proves that Luo Ruiqing and the old and new revisionists in history are birds of a feather, the most despicable traitors to Marxism-Leninism, and the most dangerous enemies of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Lenin pointed out: "To fundamentally oppose the dictatorship of the masses and the dictatorship of the leader is absurd and laughably stupid. Especially laughable is that under the banner of 'down with the leader,' some new leaders who spout nonsense and utter fallacies are actually brought out..." Luo Ruiqing's fierce opposition to Chairman Mao is precisely to elevate their black commander—the Chinese Khrushchev—to achieve their evil goal of usurping the party, the army, and the state. He often uses the phrase "two chairmen" with ulterior motives, singing praises for the representative of the capitalist restoration forces in China. During a New Year's gathering, he even publicly shouted "long live" for the Chinese Khrushchev. In 1964, when the Chinese Khrushchev was giving speeches everywhere, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's investigations and research, openly shouting for Chairman Mao to "step down" and "yield," Luo Ruiqing repeatedly used the names of the Military Commission and the General Political Department to personally draft instructions, ordering the troops to study and discuss the black reports of the Chinese Khrushchev. During the Third Session of the National People's Congress in 1965, Luo Ruiqing even more brazenly listed the Chinese Khrushchev alongside Chairman Mao as party leaders in his speech. Luo Ruiqing and his ilk attempt to impose the Chinese Khrushchev on the great Chinese Communist Party, the great Chinese people, and the great Chinese People's Liberation Army. We will not agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in ten thousand ways.

Chairman Mao will forever be our supreme leader, our supreme commander, and the red sun in our hearts. Without Chairman Mao, there would be no such great party, no such great army, no such great country, and no achievements of the Chinese people and the people of the world. The more Luo Ruiqing and his ilk fiercely oppose Chairman Mao, the more we must love, believe, worship, and be loyal to Chairman Mao without limit, forever follow Chairman Mao, and uphold the absolute authority of the great commander Chairman Mao, defending Chairman Mao's supreme leadership position. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, the whole party will unite to condemn him, and the whole nation will unite to denounce him.

Upholding the Absolute Authority of the Great Thought of Mao Zedong, Establishing the Proletarian Ideological Dominance

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To lead a great revolutionary movement, a party must have revolutionary theory, historical knowledge, and a deep understanding of the actual movement; otherwise, it is impossible to achieve victory."

Lenin also pointed out: "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no strong socialist party." "Without revolutionary theory, there can be no greatest liberation movement of the most revolutionary class in history, the proletariat."

Mao Zedong Thought is the theoretical foundation of the thought of our great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party; it is the greatest proletarian revolutionary theory guiding the great revolutionary movement of the contemporary era, a universal truth applicable everywhere. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out incisively: "Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of imperialism's comprehensive collapse and socialism's global victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the party, the army, and the nation."

The great thought of Mao Zedong is the greatest obstacle to the conspiracies of all revisionist elements to carry out counter-revolutionary activities. They hate and fear Mao Zedong Thought to death. They often use the tactic of superficially supporting while actually opposing to counter the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong. The representative of the Chinese Khrushchev, Luo Ruiqing, is exactly like this. He castrates the essence of Mao Zedong Thought, slanders Chairman Mao's great theories on class, contradiction, and class struggle in socialist society, and spreads the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" of the Chinese Khrushchev. He opposes Chairman Mao's military thought, distorts and falsifies Chairman Mao's instructions on the three implementations of the militia work, resists and sabotages the strategic principle of active defense, and opposes Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of people's war. He plays the despicable trick of opportunism, opposing the prominence of proletarian politics, castrating the core of Chairman Mao's military thought, and opposing our army's upholding of the absolute authority of the great thought of Mao Zedong. Comrade Lin Biao said that Mao Zedong Thought is the "highest and most active Marxism-Leninism of the contemporary era." Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, said that "it cannot be said this way." Comrade Lin Biao proposed that Chairman Mao's books should be treated as the highest instructions for all work of our army. Luo Ruiqing, this counter-revolutionary revisionist, said that this "does not conform to our national system."

The great thought of Mao Zedong is the developed Marxism-Leninism, the highest level of Marxism-Leninism. It solves all the major problems facing the international communist movement that previous Marxist-Leninists either did not encounter, did not have time to solve, or could not solve, especially solving the problem of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. It opens up a new era in the history of Marxism—the era of Mao Zedong Thought. All previous Marxist-Leninists did not personally command as many major political and military campaigns as Chairman Mao; they did not experience such a long, complex, intense, and multifaceted struggle. Chairman Mao's thought is the highest summary and newest conclusion of the experience of the Chinese revolution and the international communist movement. Where in history has there been such high theory? Where has there been such mature thought?

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with a population of 700 million. We need a unified thought, a revolutionary thought, a correct thought, and that is Mao Zedong Thought." While Luo Ruiqing uses the "national system" to oppose our army treating Chairman Mao's books as the highest instructions, it is extremely reactionary! Chairman Mao teaches us: The issue of the state system "only refers to one issue, that is, the position of various classes in the state." In a state under bourgeois dictatorship, the bourgeoisie is in the dominant position; in a state under proletarian dictatorship, the proletariat is in the dominant position. This dominant position not only includes the political and economic aspects but, in a certain sense, especially importantly, includes the ideological aspect. In history, every class that has taken the dominant position has established the ideological dominance of its class to consolidate its political and economic systems. Feudal society established the ideological dominance of the landlord class. Capitalist society established the ideological dominance of the bourgeoisie. After the proletariat seizes power, it not only must completely break with the old system of ownership but also must completely break with the old traditional concepts, firmly establishing the ideological dominance of the proletariat. Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism. In our era, the ideological dominance of the proletariat is the dominance of Mao Zedong Thought, which is to occupy all positions with Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. We seized power relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we must also rely on Mao Zedong Thought to maintain, consolidate, and strengthen power. If we do not do this, the victories we have achieved in the political and economic aspects, the achievements of the 28-year democratic revolution and the 18-year socialist revolution and socialist construction, may all be lost in an instant. Therefore, using Mao Zedong Thought as the highest instruction and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought is for us a matter of course, absolutely necessary, precisely what the system of the proletarian dictatorship requires of us; while not using Mao Zedong Thought as the highest instruction and not establishing the dominance of Mao Zedong Thought, it is precisely the sabotage of the system of the proletarian dictatorship, precisely the subversion of our proletarian dictatorship state from the ideological realm. The so-called "not conforming to the national system" of the counter-revolutionary revisionist Luo Ruiqing is precisely for this evil plot.

The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is the strongest pillar of the proletarian dictatorship. The invincible thought of Mao Zedong is the soul of the People's Liberation Army and the fundamental of army building. Using Mao Zedong Thought to command the army and arm the broad masses of officers and soldiers is the fundamental factor determining the proletarian nature of our army and the absolute guarantee for our army to always maintain its red flag. Luo Ruiqing opposes treating Chairman Mao's works as the highest instructions for all work of the army, striving to oppose the establishment of the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, while at the same time vigorously promoting the black "Self-Cultivation" in the army, praising the black "Self-Cultivation" as the "combination of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution," and personally ordering the entire army to treat it as a compulsory course, to "study it seriously and repeatedly," to "learn and apply it actively," and to "self-examine in comparison." He tries every means to establish the "authority" of the Chinese Khrushchev and to use counter-revolutionary revisionist and bourgeois ideology to corrupt and disintegrate us, serving the usurpation of the party and the state by the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road led by the Chinese Khrushchev. His malicious intentions are evident.

The history of the Chinese revolution for decades has proven: whenever Mao Zedong Thought gains a leading position within the party and the army, the revolutionary cause develops and wins; whenever this leading position is damaged, the revolutionary cause suffers setbacks and failures; even if it is only interfered with, it will cause great losses. The struggles of the revolutionary people of the contemporary world also prove: only by acting according to Mao Zedong Thought can one achieve victory. For China to prosper, for the people of the world to be liberated, we must rely on the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

Lenin once said that we need the theoretical authority of the global communist movement. The great thought of Mao Zedong is the theoretical authority of the contemporary communist movement. The more Luo Ruiqing and his ilk fiercely oppose Mao Zedong Thought and hate Mao Zedong Thought, the more we must love, believe, rely on, learn, propagate, realize, and defend Mao Zedong Thought; the more we must hold high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, analyze everything, criticize everything, and transform everything. Whatever conforms to Mao Zedong Thought, we must firmly support and firmly implement it, even if it means climbing mountains of knives and crossing seas of fire; whatever goes against Mao Zedong Thought, we must firmly resist and firmly oppose it, fighting it to the end. In the party, the army, the nation, and the world, we must uphold the absolute authority of the great thought of Mao Zedong and establish the ideological dominance of the proletariat.

The Mass Movement of Studying and Applying Chairman Mao's Works is the Fundamental Way to Uphold the Absolute Authority of the Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Great Thought of Mao Zedong

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole party to carry out great political struggles. If this task is not solved, the party's political tasks cannot be completed." He also said: "The foundation of the army lies in the soldiers. Without the infusion of progressive political spirit into the army and the execution of progressive political work to carry out this infusion, it is impossible to achieve true unity between officers and soldiers, to arouse the maximum anti-war enthusiasm of officers and soldiers, and for all techniques and tactics to play their best roles."

Infiltrating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought into the masses, arming hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and making them self-conscious fighters for the communist cause is the fundamental guarantee for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, carrying the socialist revolution to the end, and preventing the restoration of capitalism; it is the fundamental guarantee for completely burying all systems of exploitation and achieving the victory of communism on a global scale.

Class enemies clearly know that the spread and infiltration of Marxism-Leninism among the masses is a fatal threat to them. From the 19th-century Metternich of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the 20th-century global policeman, American imperialism; from the traitor Bernstein and Kautsky of the Second International to the modern revisionist leader Brezhnev and Kosygin of the Khrushchev revisionist clique, they all fear and fiercely oppose the spread and infiltration of Marxism-Leninism. For more than a century, the spread and infiltration of Marxism have themselves been extremely sharp and complex class struggles.

Class enemies, in opposing the spread and infiltration of Marxism-Leninism, besides using clubs and prisons, have also used various slanderous and deceptive despicable means. The Chinese Khrushchev and his representative Luo Ruiqing, in opposing the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, are exactly like this.

Clubs and prisons are the basic means of the enemy. When they are in power, reading Marxist books means imprisonment or execution. Seeing a copy of Chairman Mao's Quotations or a Mao badge, they are terrified, calling in armed police to search and beat. The Chinese Khrushchev and his representative Luo Ruiqing, although they cannot be as brazen, still, within their reach, use the power they have stolen to brazenly obstruct and sabotage the spread of Mao Zedong Thought. Luo Ruiqing bans the widespread promotion of Chairman Mao's Quotations, criticizing the Liberation Army Daily for "publishing too many quotations from Chairman Mao." He uses the excuse of too many things sent to the platoons, not allowing soldiers to print Chairman Mao's instructions. He also strongly opposes promoting Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the world. Mao Zedong Thought is not only the guiding light of the Chinese people's revolution but also the guiding light of the world people's revolution. Our support for the revolutionary people of all countries is fundamentally and most importantly supporting Mao Zedong Thought. Luo Ruiqing's opposition to promoting Mao Zedong Thought to the people of the world is a complete betrayal of the world revolution.

Saying that Marxism-Leninism does not conform to reality, is biased and empty talk, saying that it is irrelevant to the working people and dispensable, is a means used by bourgeois lackeys and various opportunists to slander Marxism-Leninism and deceive the working people. They play a role that clubs and prisons cannot. At the end of the 19th century, the Russian economists used the deceptive means of worshipping spontaneous movements to oppose the infiltration and spread of Marxism among the workers. At the beginning of the 20th century, the bourgeois lackey Hu Shi used the deceptive slogan of "study more problems and talk less about isms" to obstruct the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China. Like the old revisionists and bourgeois lackeys, the Chinese Khrushchev also vigorously promotes economism, saying that the "policy of the workers' movement should be various economic struggles." Luo Ruiqing also uses the same means, on the one hand, slandering the study and application of Chairman Mao's works as "dogmatism," openly shouting: "There is quite a bit of dogmatism in China, and also in the army!" meaning that you should not learn, and learning is of no use. On the other hand, spreading the fallacy of opportunism, saying that "military is politics," using large-scale competitions to impact the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, attempting to lead the army astray with the single-minded military viewpoint. Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are not the products of spontaneous movements. If the proletariat does not study theory, it will not have socialist and communist thought. Lenin pointed out: Any worship of the spontaneity of the workers' movement is to strengthen the influence of the bourgeois ideological system on the workers. Luo Ruiqing does this precisely to make our army deviate from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, allowing it to be deceived and manipulated by bourgeois ideology, paying attention only to single-minded military technology and practical matters, forgetting the fundamental interests of the proletariat; precisely to use bourgeois ideology to corrupt and disintegrate our army, achieving their counter-revolutionary restoration goal.

The theoretical victory of Marxism forces its enemies to don the cloak of Marxism, waving the "red flag" to oppose the red flag. The old revisionists of the Second International and the modern revisionist clique of Khrushchev have always done this to Marxism and Leninism. The Chinese Khrushchev is in the same line, using the pretext of studying Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to oppose learning from Chairman Mao. His representative Luo Ruiqing, on the surface, stipulates that senior cadres should only study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, which is completely deceptive. Its purpose is to oppose learning from Chairman Mao's works. Mao Zedong Thought and Marxism-Leninism are originally unified and consistent, a higher and more developed Marxism-Leninism. In our era, learning Mao Zedong Thought is the shortcut to learning Marxism-Leninism. While the Chinese Khrushchev and his representative Luo Ruiqing insist on separating and opposing them. The despicable trick they play, as Lenin said: "When great revolutionaries are alive, the oppressing classes always persecute them, treating their doctrines with the most malicious hostility, the most frenzied hatred, and the most brazen slander. After their death, they try to turn them into harmless idols, that is, to idolize them, giving their names some honor, to 'comfort' and deceive the oppressed classes." The Chinese Khrushchev and his representative Luo Ruiqing stipulating that only the original works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin should be studied are also like the enemies of Marxism-Leninism that Lenin talked about, aiming to turn the great revolutionaries who have passed away into harmless idols to "comfort" and deceive the masses. While towards the greatest proletarian revolutionary of the contemporary era, Chairman Mao, and the highest and most active Marxism-Leninism of the contemporary era, Mao Zedong Thought, they fiercely slander, attack, falsify, and distort. This fully exposes their desperate attempts to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought and strangle the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's intimate comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, using Mao Zedong Thought, summarized the historical experience of social development and the international communist movement. Facing the fact that the domestic and international enemies, especially the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, fiercely attack Mao Zedong Thought, with astonishing courage and determination, he firmly and unshakably advocates and vigorously promotes the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the army, the party, and the nation, opening up a broad path for hundreds of millions of people to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, creating the fundamental way to uphold the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong. He gave the most comprehensive, deepest, and most incisive exposition of the significance of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He called on the whole party, the whole army, and the people of the whole nation to definitely learn Mao Zedong Thought thoroughly, read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. He stressed the need to unify the thoughts of the whole party and the thoughts of the masses of the whole nation with Mao Zedong Thought, turning the whole nation into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. He proposed a set of learning principles and methods of studying with problems, actively applying, combining learning with use, learning first for urgent use, seeing immediate results, and focusing on the "use" aspect. This is a great innovation, making Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought achieve unprecedented scale of popularization and spread in all of China and the world, appearing an unprecedented magnificent ideological revolution in the history of the international communist movement.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "People's social existence determines people's thoughts. Once the correct thoughts representing the advanced class are grasped by the masses, they will become the material force to transform society and the world." The officers and soldiers of the whole army, under the direct leadership of Comrade Lin Biao, carried out extensive and in-depth mass movements of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Political awareness has been greatly improved, and ideological revolutionization has achieved great results. Heroes like Lei Feng, Ou Yanghai, Wang Jie, Mai Xiande, and Liu Yingjun have emerged. A new generation of communists is rapidly growing. Advanced collectives are emerging in large numbers. The combat effectiveness of our army is stronger than ever. The national defense science of our country is developing at an astonishing speed, successfully detonating atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, and nuclear missiles. The people of the whole country respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "learn from the People's Liberation Army," launching a magnificent mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. The masses have never been as spirited and full of vigor as they are now. Industry is continuously advancing, agriculture is bountiful year after year, and science and technology are continuously reaching new heights. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the whole party, the whole army, and the whole nation has entered a new stage. Under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, using the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as a weapon, with "criticize selfishness and repudiate revisionism" as the guideline, we launch a great criticism and struggle against the bourgeois headquarters headed by the Chinese Khrushchev, defeating the group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, making them fall into disarray. Greatly promoting the ideological revolutionization of the whole party, the whole army, and the people of the whole nation. A country with a quarter of the world's population is becoming a great school of red Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary people of the world learning from Chairman Mao's works have become an irresistible tide. More and more revolutionary people are grasping Mao Zedong Thought, and the world revolution is presenting a new situation. The flames of armed struggle are burning fiercely in Vietnam, Laos, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, India, and the whole of Southeast Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The working class of Western Europe and North America has awakened anew. The black people of America have bravely taken up arms, and the gunshots of revolution are echoing within the world's number one reactionary stronghold. The revolutionary people of revisionist countries are gradually seeing through the traitorous faces of the revisionist ruling clique and will rise up to overthrow the rule of the traitorous clique.

Countless facts prove: once the great thought of Mao Zedong is grasped by hundreds of millions of people, it will become an endless force to transform society and the world, becoming an atomic bomb of immense power. The path opened by Comrade Lin Biao of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is absolutely correct and has already achieved great results. We must, with the greatest determination and willpower, continuously push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights in all of China and the world, upholding the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong.

Upholding the Absolute Authority of the Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Great Thought of Mao Zedong is the Extremely Honorable and Great Task Assigned by the Era

The evil activities of the Chinese Khrushchev and his bourgeois representatives in the party, government, army, and various cultural circles, opposing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, are not isolated. They are part of the revisionist backlash that has emerged in the international communist movement.

In the history of the development of Marxism, whenever Marxism achieves historical victories and reaches a new stage, all opportunists unite to attack and curse the proletarian leaders and their great thoughts. In this sense, the history of the international communist movement is also the history of the struggle to establish and oppose the authority of proletarian leaders and their thoughts.

Marx and his intimate comrade Engels defeated various "socialist" factions, established Marxism, and won extremely high prestige among the proletariat, creating the international communist movement. Engels, with his lifelong efforts, upheld the authority of Marx and Marxism, making the international communist movement flourish. The leaders of the Second International, Bernstein and Kautsky, after Engels' death, openly betrayed Marx and Marxism, leading the international communist movement astray. Lenin smashed the Second International revisionism, restored the revolutionary spirit of Marxism, raised Marxism to the level of Leninism, and won high prestige among the Russian and global revolutionary people, creating the first great socialist state and a new era in the international communist movement. After Lenin's death, Stalin smashed the fierce attacks of Trotsky and Bukharin, defending Leninism. However, soon after his death, the modern revisionist clique of Khrushchev trampled on the great banner of Lenin, carrying out the restoration of capitalism in the world's first socialist state, causing a heart-wrenching tragedy in the contemporary international communist movement.

The historical experience of the international communist movement proves that establishing the authority of proletarian leaders and their genius thoughts can greatly promote the cause of the proletarian revolution; if it is not established enough or is interfered with, the cause of the proletarian revolution will suffer losses. Whenever this authority is destroyed by various opportunists, it will inevitably lead to a great setback in the cause of the proletarian revolution.

Now, the world has entered the new era of the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Upholding the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong is the key to ensuring the victory of the proletarian revolutionary cause, a matter of the utmost importance related to the fate of the people of the whole of China and the world, and an extremely honorable and great task assigned by the era.

Our great leader Chairman Mao's most intimate comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, based on Chairman Mao's theory of class and class struggle in the socialist period, based on the serious facts of the two-line struggle within the party, and based on the historical lessons of the international proletarian dictatorship, with the strongest revolutionary will, overcame the various sabotages and interferences of the class enemies, upholding the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong. This is Comrade Lin Biao's outstanding contribution to the international communist movement. Comrade Lin Biao gave the most comprehensive, correct, and scientific evaluation of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. He called on the whole party, the whole army, and the people of the whole nation to unite around Chairman Mao and unite around Mao Zedong Thought. He actively advocated and vigorously promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works among the people of the whole nation and pushed this great movement to the whole world. He has always loyally, resolutely, and thoroughly carried out Mao Zedong Thought, setting a brilliant example for us to uphold the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong.

The great historical task of upholding the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong has been honorably bestowed upon our shoulders. We must resolutely respond to Comrade Lin Biao's great call, with a thousandfold and ten thousandfold increase in our awareness of upholding the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. We must, with a thousandfold and ten thousandfold increase in our strength, resist the sabotage of domestic and foreign enemies against the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great thought of Mao Zedong, and strive to complete the extremely honorable and great task assigned by history, spreading the invincible, boundless red flag of Mao Zedong Thought throughout all of China and the world!

    大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，
    大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    ——彻底清算罗瑞卿反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的滔天罪行
    杨成武
    四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。人类进入了帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，进入了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代。
    在我们这个伟大的时代，世界上有两面旗帜。一面是我们伟大领袖毛主席高举着的鲜红的革命大旗，全世界无产阶级和一切革命人民正集合在这面大旗下胜利前进。一面是美帝国主义和它的帮凶苏联现代修正主义集团支撑着的反革命黑旗，一切帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派正麇集在这面破旗下垂死挣扎。你是革命者，你是马克思列宁主义者，你就必然拥护伟大领袖毛主席，拥护战无不胜的毛泽东思想；你是反革命，你是反马克思列宁主义者，你就必然反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想。
    对待毛主席和毛泽东思想的态度，在我们这个伟大的时代，已经成为革命和反革命、真革命和假革命、马克思列宁主义和反革命修正主义最灵验的试金石和分水岭。
    以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，出于反革命复辟阴谋的需要，疯狂地反对我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，恶毒攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想。资产阶级阴谋家、野心家罗瑞卿，是隐藏在党内的资产阶级司令部的重要成员，是中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人。他的根本罪恶，就是长期以来秉承中国赫鲁晓夫的旨意，恶毒诽谤毛主席，攻击和歪曲毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级建军路线，反对毛主席的军事思想，反对树立毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，妄图按照资产阶级面貌改造我们无产阶级的军队。我们必须用毛泽东思想这个最强大的武器，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其代理人罗瑞卿之流批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清其流毒。在革命的大批判中，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
      大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，誓死捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位
    马克思列宁主义者历来认为，无产阶级革命政党必须要由最有威信、最有经验的卓越的伟大领袖来领导，才能完成伟大的共产主义革命事业。列宁指出：“工人阶级为了在全世界进行艰巨的顽强的斗争以争取彻底解放，是需要权威的。……每一个国家的无产者都需要全世界范围的无产阶级斗争的权威。”①他又说，“培养一批有经验、有极高威信的党的领袖，这是一件长期的艰苦的事情。但不这样做，无产阶级专政、无产阶级的‘意志统一’，就会成为一句空话。”②
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，就是中国和世界无产阶级、革命人民在长期的革命斗争实践中推举出来的伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手，就是当代全世界无产阶级斗争的权威。他有最坚定、最彻底的无产阶级革命精神和最巧妙、最灵活的斗争艺术，他有极其深刻的马克思列宁主义智慧和极其丰富的斗争经验。他最相信群众，最关心群众，最支持群众的革命运动，和革命群众心连心。他在全中国和全世界有最高的威望。他天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段。林彪同志一贯地全力树立毛主席的绝对权威，全力树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。林彪同志对光焰无际的毛泽东思想作出了最正确、最科学、最崇高的马克思列宁主义的评价，几十年如一日地忠实捍卫、执行、宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想，英勇地捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位。他指出：毛主席是我们时代的代表，是党的代表，是群众的代表，是无产阶级的代表，是群众的领袖，群众的灵魂。毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是当代无产阶级最杰出的领袖，是当代最伟大的天才。
    罗瑞卿这个混入党内的资产阶级代表人物，出于反革命的阶级本能，长期反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席。早在第二次国内革命战争时期，他就是王明路线的追随者。抗日战争时期，他是彭德怀进行反党活动的同谋。全国解放以后，他参与了彭、高、饶反党联盟的阴谋活动。社会主义革命步步深入，他反对毛主席的活动也变本加厉。中国人民和全世界革命人民无限热爱毛主席，但是，罗瑞卿却恬不知耻地、恶毒地攻击毛主席，攻击毛泽东思想，攻击毛主席的伟大天才，攻击党的总路线、大跃进和人民公社。这种卑鄙无耻的攻击，正是他配合国际上帝、修、反疯狂反华，妄图在国内掀起反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的反革命逆流的阴谋大暴露！正是他妄图进行资本主义复辟的反革命修正主义嘴脸的大暴露！
      马克思主义者从来重视无产阶级领袖的个人天才，而且认为这是推举领袖必须考虑的一个重要方面，不看到这一点，就不能把无产阶级最伟大的天才舵手选为自己的领袖。恩格斯高度颂扬马克思的伟大的天才，他说：“我们之所以有今天，都应当归功于他，现代运动之所以有这样的成绩，都应当归功于他的理论和实践的活动，没有他，我们直到现在还会在黑暗中徘徊。”③列宁也说，要有十几个天才的领袖，才能领导俄国革命取得胜利。毛主席的言论、著作和革命实践，都表现出他的伟大的无产阶级的天才。他解决了当代共产主义运动提出的一系列重大理论和实践问题，攀登了马克思主义发展史上最新的高峰，他站得最高，看得最远，最善于在极端复杂和困难的情况下，把群众的革命斗争引向胜利。林彪同志说：毛主席这样的天才，全世界几百年、中国几千年才出现一个。毛主席是全世界最伟大的天才。
    罗瑞卿在苏共二十大以后反对“提个人天才”，而且特别说明是反对“再提个人天才”。这就暴露了他是赫鲁晓夫“反对个人迷信”的狂热追随者和忠实的门徒，他是用赫鲁晓夫反对斯大林的同样手法，反对我们的伟大领袖毛主席。
    在国际共产主义运动的历史上，利用所谓“反对个人迷信”之类的口号，诽谤无产阶级的领袖，破坏无产阶级事业，是新老修正主义者惯用的伎俩。第一国际时代的阴谋家巴枯宁，用这类口号咒骂过马克思。第二国际时代的叛徒考茨基，用这类口号咒骂过列宁。第三国际时代的叛徒托洛茨基，用这类口号咒骂过斯大林。赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团，用这类口号大反特反斯大林，篡夺了苏联党和国家的领导权。对于当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们的伟大领袖毛主席，他们更是肆无忌惮地用“反对个人迷信”这类口号加以攻击。罗瑞卿秉承我国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，同赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团一唱一和，也用这类口号恶毒诋毁、反对全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席。这就充分证明，罗瑞卿和历史上新、老修正主义者是一丘之貉，是马克思列宁主义最卑鄙的叛徒，是无产阶级革命事业最危险的敌人。
    列宁指出：“把群众专政和领袖专政根本地对立起来，实在是荒唐和愚蠢得可笑。尤其可笑的是人们在‘打倒领袖’这一口号掩饰下，实际上竟把一些胡说八道、满口谬论的新领袖拉出来……”④罗瑞卿大反毛主席，就是为了抬出他们那个胡说八道、满口谬论的黑司令——中国的赫鲁晓夫，达到他们篡党、篡军、篡国的罪恶目的。他经常别有用心地使用“两个主席”的提法，为中国资本主义复辟势力的总代表捧场、讴歌。在一次元旦团拜时，他竟公然为中国赫鲁晓夫高喊“万岁”。一九六四年，正当中国赫鲁晓夫到处作报告，大反毛主席的调查研究，公开叫嚷要毛主席“下台”、“让位”的时候，罗瑞卿就多次盗用军委、总政的名义，亲自起草批示，要部队学习、讨论中国赫鲁晓夫的这些黑报告。一九六五年召开第三届全国人民代表大会时，罗瑞卿更明目张胆地在发言稿中把中国赫鲁晓夫同毛主席并列为党的领袖。罗瑞卿之流妄图把中国赫鲁晓夫强加在伟大的中国共产党、伟大的中国人民、伟大的中国人民解放军头上，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。
    毛主席永远是我们的最高领袖，永远是我们的最高统帅，永远是我们心中最红最红的红太阳。没有毛主席，就没有我们这样一个伟大的党，就没有我们这样一支伟大的军队，就没有我们这样一个伟大的国家，就没有中国人民的一切，就没有世界人民的翻身解放。罗瑞卿之流越是疯狂地反对毛主席，我们就越要对毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚，永远紧跟毛主席，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席的绝对权威，誓死捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位。谁要反对毛主席，就全党共诛之，全国共讨之。
        大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，牢固建立无产阶级的思想统治
    毛主席教导我们：“指导一个伟大的革命运动的政党，如果没有革命理论，没有历史知识，没有对于实际运动的深刻的了解，要取得胜利是不可能的。”⑤
    列宁也指出：“没有革命理论，就不会有坚强的社会主义政党”。⑥“没有革命的理论，就不可能有被压迫阶级，即历史上最革命的阶级的世界上最伟大的解放运动。”⑦
      毛泽东思想就是指导我们伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党思想的理论基础；就是指导当代伟大的革命运动的最伟大的无产阶级革命理论，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。林彪同志精辟地指出：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”⑧
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是一切修正主义分子阴谋搞反革命活动的最大障碍。他们对毛泽东思想恨得要死，怕得要命，往往采取表面拥护，实际反对的反革命两面手法，反对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。中国赫鲁晓夫的代理人罗瑞卿正是这样。他阉割毛泽东思想的精髓，诋毁毛主席关于社会主义社会阶级、矛盾和阶级斗争的伟大学说，大肆散布中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；他反对毛主席的军事思想，歪曲和篡改毛主席关于民兵工作三落实的指示，抵制和破坏积极防御的战略方针，反对毛主席人民战争的光辉思想；他玩弄折中主义即机会主义的卑劣手段，反对突出无产阶级政治，阉割毛主席建军思想的核心，反对我军大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。林彪同志说，毛泽东思想是“当代最高、最活的马克思列宁主义”。⑨罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子就胡说什么：“不能这样讲。”林彪同志提出，要把毛主席的书当作我军各项工作的最高指示。罗瑞卿这个反革命修正主义分子就胡说这“不符合我们国家的体制”。
    伟大的毛泽东思想，是发展了的马克思列宁主义，是最高水平的马克思列宁主义。她解决了所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者，或者没有遇到过，或者没有来得及解决，或者没有能够解决的国际共产主义运动面临的一系列重大问题，特别是解决了在无产阶级专政下继续进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的问题，在马克思主义发展史上开创了一个崭新的时代——毛泽东思想的时代。所有前辈的马克思列宁主义者，都没有象毛主席这样，亲临前线指挥那么多重大的政治战役、军事战役；都没有象毛主席经历过那样长期、那样复杂、那样激烈、那样多方面的斗争。毛主席的思想是中国革命和国际共产主义运动经验的最高概括和最新总结。古今中外哪里有这样高的理论？哪里有这样成熟的思想？
    林彪同志说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”⑩而罗瑞卿竟用“国家体制”，反对我军把毛主席的书当作最高指示，真是反动透顶！毛主席教导我们：国体问题，“它只是指的一个问题，就是社会各阶级在国家中的地位。”?资产阶级专政的国家，资产阶级占统治地位；无产阶级专政的国家，无产阶级占统治地位。这种统治地位，不仅包括政治方面和经济方面，而且在一定意义上说来，尤其重要的是包括思想方面。历史上，每一个取得统治地位的阶级，都建立自己阶级思想的统治，用以巩固它的政治制度和经济制度。封建社会建立了地主阶级的思想统治。资本主义社会建立了资产阶级的思想统治。无产阶级在夺取政权以后，不仅要同旧的所有制实行彻底的决裂，而且要同旧的传统观念实行彻底的决裂，牢固地建立无产阶级在思想上的统治。毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的崭新阶段。在我们的时代，无产阶级在思想上的统治，就是毛泽东思想的统治，就是要用毛泽东思想去占领一切阵地。毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，我们夺取政权靠毛泽东思想，保持政权、巩固政权、强化政权也必须靠毛泽东思想。不这样做，我们在政权方面所取得的胜利和经济方面所取得的胜利，我们二十八年民主革命所取得的成果和十八年社会主义革命和社会主义建设所取得的成果，都可能付之东流，毁于一旦。所以，用毛泽东思想作最高指示，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，对于我们，是天经地义的、绝对必要的，这正是无产阶级专政的国家体制所要求于我们的；而不用毛泽东思想作最高指示，不去建立毛泽东思想的统治，则恰恰是破坏无产阶级专政的国家体制，恰恰是从意识形态领域颠覆我们这个无产阶级专政的国家。反革命修正主义分子罗瑞卿的所谓“不合国体”论，正是出于这个罪恶的阴谋目的。
    伟大的中国人民解放军是无产阶级专政最坚强的柱石。战无不胜的毛泽东思想是人民解放军的灵魂，是我军建设的根本。用毛泽东思想统帅我军，武装我军广大指战员的头脑，是决定我军无产阶级性质的根本因素，是我军永远保持鲜红旗帜的绝对保证。罗瑞卿反对把毛主席的著作当作全军各项工作的最高指示，拚死命地反对树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，而同时又在军队中大肆推销黑《修养》，吹捧黑《修养》是什么“马列主义和中国革命实践的结合”，并亲自下令要全军当作必修课，要“认真地、反复地学”，“活学活用”，“对照检查”，千方百计地妄图为中国赫鲁晓夫树立“权威”，极力妄图用反革命修正主义、资产阶级的思想腐蚀和瓦解我们，为以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党、篡政服务。其恶毒用心，昭然若揭。
    中国革命几十年的历史雄辩地证明：每当毛泽东思想在党内军内取得领导地位的时候，革命事业就发展，就胜利；每当这种领导地位遭到破坏的时候，革命事业就遭受挫折和失败；即便只是受到干扰，也会带来很大损失。当代世界革命人民的斗争也同样证明：只有按照毛泽东思想办事，才能取得胜利。中国要兴旺，世界人民要解放，都要靠伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    列宁曾经说过，我们需要全世界范围的共产主义运动的理论权威。伟大的毛泽东思想，就是当代共产主义运动的理论权威。罗瑞卿之流越是疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，仇视毛泽东思想，我们对毛泽东思想，就越要热爱她、坚信她、依靠她、学习她、宣传她、实现她、捍卫她；越要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗举得高高的，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，分析一切，批判一切，改造一切。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决拥护，坚决照办，上刀山，下火海，也要保证她实现；凡是违背毛泽东思想的，我们就坚决抵制，坚决反对，坚决同他斗争到底。在全党、全军、全国、全世界大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，在全党、全军、全国牢固建立无产阶级的思想统治。
        活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，是大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的根本途径
    毛主席教导我们：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”?他又说：“军队的基础在士兵，没有进步的政治精神贯注于军队之中，没有进步的政治工作去执行这种贯注，就不能达到真正的官长和士兵的一致，就不能激发官兵最大限度的抗战热忱，一切技术和战术就不能得着最好的基础去发挥它们应有的效力。”?
    把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想灌输到群众中去，使亿万革命群众都用毛泽东思想武装起来，成为自觉地为共产主义事业献身的英勇战士，是巩固无产阶级专政，把社会主义革命进行到底，防止资本主义复辟的根本保证；是彻底埋葬一切剥削制度，使共产主义在全世界范围内取得胜利的根本保证。
    阶级敌人清楚地知道马克思列宁主义在群众中传播和灌输，对他们是致命的威胁。从十九世纪奥匈帝国的梅特涅，到二十世纪的世界宪兵美帝国主义；从第二国际的叛徒伯恩施坦、考茨基，到现代的赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团的头子勃列日涅夫、柯西金，都十分害怕并疯狂反对马克思列宁主义的传播和灌输。一个半世纪以来，马克思主义的传播、灌输，本身就是极其尖锐、极其复杂的阶级斗争。
    阶级敌人在反对马克思列宁主义的传播和灌输上，除了使用警棍和监狱以外，还使用了种种污蔑和欺骗的卑鄙手法。中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人罗瑞卿，在反对毛泽东思想传播上，也正是这样。
    警棍和监狱，是敌人的基本手法。在他们占据统治地位的时候，读马克思主义的书，要坐牢，要杀头。看到一本毛主席语录、一枚毛主席像章，他们都惊恐万状，调来武装军警进行搜捕和殴打。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其代理人罗瑞卿，虽然不能象他们那样放肆，但也在力所能及的范围内，利用窃取的职权，胆大妄为地阻挠和破坏毛泽东思想的传播。罗瑞卿禁止广泛宣传毛主席语录，指责《解放军报》“刊载毛主席语录太多了”。他借口发到连队的东西太多，不准给战士印发毛主席的指示。他还竭力反对向世界人民宣传毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想不仅是中国人民革命的指针，而且是世界人民革命的指针，我们支援世界各国人民革命，最根本、最重要的支援就是支援毛泽东思想。罗瑞卿反对向世界人民宣传毛泽东思想，就是对世界革命的彻底背叛。
    把马克思列宁主义说成不符合实际的偏见和空论，说成与劳动人民无关的、可有可无的东西，这是资产阶级御用文人和形形色色机会主义者污蔑马克思列宁主义，欺骗劳动人民惯用的手法。它们起着警棍和监狱所起不到的作用。十九世纪末叶，俄国的经济主义者用崇拜自发运动的欺骗手法来反对向工人群众灌输和传播马克思主义。二十世纪初，中国的资产阶级御用学者胡适，用“多研究些问题，少谈些主义”的欺骗口号来阻挠马克思列宁主义在中国的传播。同老修正主义者和资产阶级御用学者一样，中国的赫鲁晓夫也大力推行经济主义，胡说什么“职工运动之方针应作各种经济斗争”。罗瑞卿也用同样手法，一方面把活学活用毛主席著作污蔑为“教条主义”，公开叫嚣：
  “中国教条主义的东西可不少，军队也有嘛！”意思是说，你们根本不该学，学了也没有用。一方面则散布折中主义的谬论，胡说什么“军事就是政治”，用大比武冲击活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，妄图把军队引向单纯军事观点的歧途。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想不是自发运动的产物。无产阶级如果不学习理论，就不会有社会主义、共产主义的思想。列宁指出：对工人运动自发性的任何崇拜，都是加强资产阶级思想体系对于工人的影响。罗瑞卿这样做的目的，就是要使我军脱离毛泽东思想的指导，听任资产阶级思想的愚弄和摆布，只注意单纯的军事技术和实际事务，而忘记无产阶级的根本利益；就是要用资产阶级思想来腐蚀和瓦解我们的军队，以达到他们反革命复辟的目的。
    马克思主义在理论上的胜利，迫使它的敌人披上马克思主义的外衣，打着“红旗”反红旗。第二国际老修正主义者和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团，对马克思主义和列宁主义，历来如此。中国的赫鲁晓夫同他们一脉相承，打着学习马恩列斯的幌子，反对向毛主席学习。他的代理人罗瑞卿，在表面上规定高级干部只学习马恩列斯著作，这完全是骗人的，其目的是为了反对学习毛主席的著作。毛泽东思想和马克思列宁主义本来是统一的、一致的，是更高级的更发展了的马克思列宁主义。在我们的时代，学习毛泽东思想是学习马克思列宁主义的捷径。而中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人罗瑞卿，却硬要把它们分离开来，对立起来。他们玩弄的这种卑劣手法，正如列宁所说的：“当伟大的革命家在世时，压迫阶级总是不断迫害他们，以最恶毒的敌意、最疯狂的仇恨、最放肆的诽谤对待他们的学说。在他们逝世以后，便企图把他们变为无害的神像，即所谓把他们偶像化，赋予他们的名字某种荣誉，以便‘安慰’和愚弄被压迫阶级”。?中国赫鲁晓夫和他的代理人罗瑞卿规定只学马恩列斯原著，也正象列宁所说的马克思主义的敌人那样，是为了把已经逝世的伟大革命家变成无害的神象，来“安慰”和愚弄群众。而对于当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家毛主席、当代最高最活的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，却疯狂地进行诽谤、攻击、篡改和歪曲。这就充分暴露了他们千方百计阻挠毛泽东思想传播，扼杀活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的狰狞面目。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志，用毛泽东思想总结了社会发展和国际共产主义运动的历史经验，面对着国内外敌人特别是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂攻击毛泽东思想的事实，以惊人的魄力和决心，在全军、全党和全国坚定不移地积极倡导、全力推进活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，开辟了亿万群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的广阔道路，创造了大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的根本途径。他最全面、最深刻、最精辟地阐述了活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的意义。他号召全党、全军和全国人民一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。他强调要用毛泽东思想统一全党的思想，统一全国人民群众的思想，把全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校。他提出了带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在“用”字上狠下功夫的一整套学习原则和方法。这是一个伟大的创举，使马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想在全中国、全世界得到空前规模的大普及、大传播，在国际共产主义运动的历史上出现了空前宏伟的思想革命运动。
    毛主席教导我们：“人们的社会存在，决定人们的思想。而代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量。”?
    全军指战员在林彪同志的直接领导下，开展了广泛深入的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。政治觉悟空前提高，思想革命化获得巨大成果，出现了雷锋、欧阳海、王杰、麦贤得、刘英俊等毛主席的好战士。一代共产主义新人正在迅速地成长。先进集体大量涌现。我军的战斗力，比过去任何时候都更加强大。我国国防科学以惊人的速度向前发展，成功地爆炸了原子弹、氢弹和导弹核武器。全国人民响应毛主席的“学习人民解放军”的伟大号召，开展了波澜壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。亿万群众从来也没有象现在这样精神振奋，意气风发，工业持续跃进，农业连年丰收，科学技术不断攀登新的高峰。在无产阶级文化大革命中，全党、全军和全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，进入了一个崭新的阶段。在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导下，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，以“斗私，批修”为纲，向以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级司令部展开大批判、大斗争，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打得落花流水，人仰马翻。大大促进了全党、全军和全国人民的思想革命化。占世界人口四分之一的大国，正在变成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    世界革命人民学习毛主席著作，已经成为不可阻挡的潮流。越来越多的革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，世界革命出现了新的局面。武装斗争的烈火，在越南，在老挝，在印尼，在缅甸，在泰国，在印度，在整个东南亚，在非洲，在拉丁美洲等地区，正在熊熊燃烧。西欧北美的工人阶级有了新的觉醒。美国黑人英勇地拿起了武器，世界头号反动堡垒的内部响起了革命的枪声。修正主义国家的革命人民逐渐看清修正主义统治集团的叛徒面目，他们一定会起来推翻叛徒集团的统治。
    无数事实雄辩地证明：伟大的毛泽东思想一旦被亿万群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。林彪同志开创的活学活用毛主席著作的道路无比正确，并已经取得了伟大的成效。我们要以最大的决心、最大的毅力，在全中国、全世界把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动不断推向新的高潮，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
      大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是时代赋予我们的极其光荣而伟大的任务
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其在党里、政府里、军队里以及各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，反对毛主席和毛泽东思想绝对权威的罪恶活动，并不是孤立的。它是当前国际共产主义运动中出现的修正主义逆流的一个组成部分。
    在马克思主义的发展史上，每当马克思主义取得历史性的胜利，提高到一个新阶段的时候，一切机会主义者就联合起来，攻击和谩骂无产阶级领袖及其伟大思想。从这个意义上说，国际共产主义运动的历史，也就是树立和反对树立无产阶级领袖和领袖思想权威的斗争史。
    马克思和他的亲密战友恩格斯，战胜了五花八门的“社会主义”派别，创立了马克思主义，在无产阶级中赢得了极高的威望，开创了国际共产主义运动。恩格斯以毕生的精力，大树马克思和马克思主义的权威，使国际共产主义运动出现了一个蓬勃发展的局面。第二国际的头头伯恩施坦和考茨基，在恩格斯去世以后，公开背叛了马克思和马克思主义，把国际共产主义运动引上了邪路。列宁粉碎了第二国际修正主义，恢复了马克思主义的革命精神，把马克思主义提高到了列宁主义的阶段，在俄国和世界革命人民中赢得了崇高威望，缔造了第一个伟大的社会主义国家，开创了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。斯大林，在列宁去世后，粉碎了托洛茨基和布哈林的猖狂进攻，捍卫了列宁主义。但是，他去世不久，赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义集团就践踏了伟大列宁的旗帜，在世界上第一个社会主义国家实行了资本主义复辟，造成了当代国际共产主义运动中触目惊心的大悲剧。
    国际共产主义运动的历史经验证明，树立了无产阶级领袖及其天才思想的权威，就能够极大地推动无产阶级革命事业前进；树立得不够，或者是受到了干扰，无产阶级革命事业就要遭受损失。而每当这种权威被形形色色的机会主义者所破坏，就必将招致无产阶级革命事业的大倒退。
    现在，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是保证无产阶级革命事业取得胜利的关键，是关系到全中国和全世界人民命运的头等大事，是时代赋予我们的极其光荣而伟大的任务。
    我们伟大统帅毛主席最亲密的战友林彪同志根据毛主席关于社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的理论，根据党内两条路线斗争的严重事实，根据国际无产阶级专政的历史教训，以最坚强的革命毅力，战胜了阶级敌人的种种破坏和干扰，大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这是林彪同志对国际共产主义运动的杰出贡献。林彪同志对毛主席和毛泽东思想作了最全面、最正确、最科学的评价。他号召全党、全军和全国人民，都要以毛主席为中心来团结，以毛泽东思想为中心来团结。他积极倡导、全力推进全国人民活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，并把这个伟大运动推向全世界。他一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地贯彻毛泽东思想，用他的伟大实践为我们作出了大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的光辉榜样。
    大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的伟大历史任务，已经光荣地落到了我们的肩上。我们要坚决响应林彪同志的伟大号召，要一千倍一万倍地提高大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的自觉性，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段。要一千倍一万倍地加强反击国内外敌人破坏伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的战斗力，为完成历史赋予我们的极其光荣而伟大的任务，把战无不胜的、光焰无际的毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全中国、全世界而奋斗！
