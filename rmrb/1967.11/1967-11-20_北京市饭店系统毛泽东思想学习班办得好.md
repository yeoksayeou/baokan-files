The Mao Zedong Thought study class in Beijing's hotel system is well organized. Workers' political and ideological outlook has been completely transformed, rapidly achieving revolutionary unity within departments, creating favorable conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination. In response to Chairman Mao's great call to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism, and with the help of the People's Liberation Army, the hotel system in Beijing, starting in early September, successively established Mao Zedong Thought study classes in eight units, including Xiangshan Hotel, Minzu Hotel, Xinqiao Hotel, Peace Hotel, Xiyuan Hotel, Huaqiao Building, Qianmen Hotel, and Beijing Hotel. Through these classes, the boundless Mao Zedong Thought has penetrated deeply into people's hearts. The political and ideological outlook of the broad masses of workers has been completely transformed, directly promoting and consolidating the revolutionary great alliance within the hotel system in Beijing, creating favorable conditions for the realization of the revolutionary three-in-one combination, and achieving a great leap forward in both revolution and production. Good deeds and good people have emerged in large numbers. Workers unanimously praise: "The Mao Zedong Thought study class is excellent!"

First and foremost, we must uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

Before the Cultural Revolution, the eight major hotels in Beijing were directly controlled by the old municipal committee. The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen, in order to achieve their evil goal of restoring capitalism, fiercely opposed Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, using every means to suppress the masses from studying the works of Chairman Mao. They proposed the so-called "four autonomies": self-selected content, self-determined time, voluntary participation, and free association. In reality, this was to prevent the great Mao Zedong Thought from spreading among the broad masses of workers. They promoted the idea of "rewarding with bonuses" in various hotels, advocating that "mastering skills makes one a manager, mastering English makes one a translator, and technical proficiency opens doors." Workers couldn't even buy the works of Chairman Mao, and in their spare time, they could only play cards, read novels, and the political atmosphere was extremely thin. After the Cultural Revolution began, under the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line executed by the old municipal committee, the eight hotels in Beijing, without exception, split into two major factions. Usually, cadres and service personnel working in the same office, team, or dining hall were opposed to each other, seriously affecting the hotel system's revolutionary criticism, revolutionary great alliance, and revolutionary three-in-one combination.

Facing this situation, the PLA comrades stationed in the hotel system, after careful analysis and research, unanimously agreed that to implement Chairman Mao's great instructions on revolutionary great alliance and revolutionary three-in-one combination in the hotel system in Beijing, the first and foremost task is to uphold the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they repeatedly propagated the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought among the broad masses of workers; repeatedly propagated the importance of using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's worldview; repeatedly propagated that the attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the touchstone and dividing line between today's revolution and counter-revolution, true revolution and false revolution; repeatedly propagated that the attitude towards studying the works of Chairman Mao is a matter of stance and class sentiment. Although the antagonism between the two factions of workers was severe, some even engaged in "internal wars" daily, unable to sit down or sit together to study, the PLA comrades' determination to promote the study of the works of Chairman Mao remained unwavering. They used every means to overcome numerous difficulties and finally established Mao Zedong Thought study classes in various hotels. Some hotels even led other hotels in the same industry to establish such classes. For example, Xinqiao Hotel led Minzu Restaurant (Donglaishun), and Huaqiao Building led Beijing Roast Duck Restaurant (Quanjude), and so on.

We must grasp and intensify the struggle against active thoughts, inspiring the broad masses of workers to voluntarily fight selfishness and criticize revisionism.

Fighting selfishness is not an easy task. At the beginning of the study classes, due to the severe opposition between the two revolutionary mass organizations, some people were unwilling to come. Those who came were in the role of "observers," adopting a wait-and-see attitude, ready to expose each other's shortcomings. Some came with "ammunition" prepared for a debate. Both sides were equally matched in selecting participants for the study classes, with both literary and martial arts representatives. Some people had great reservations about exposing their shortcomings, fearing that the other side would seize the opportunity to expose them, or that their own organization would label them as "traitors" or "fools." In short, the students came with various active thoughts. If these active thoughts were not resolved, the study attitude would not be correct, and the study classes would be difficult to conduct.

How to solve this problem?

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Mao Zedong Thought, when grasped by the broad masses, will become an endless force, becoming a spiritually powerful atomic bomb." The PLA comrades, targeting the active thoughts of the students, organized them to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's important instructions, "Old Three Articles," and the great work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," guiding them to strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions. They emphasized organizing the students to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's quotations: "Treating comrades as enemies is to stand on the enemy's side," and "For the people's interests, persist in what is correct; for the people's interests, correct what is wrong." The great leader's brilliant thoughts and brilliant words greatly enhanced the workers' proletarian consciousness. At this time, Chairman Mao's latest instructions were conveyed: "Within the working class, there are no fundamental conflicts of interest. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, there is even less reason for the working class to split into two irreconcilable factions." The broad masses of workers regarded Chairman Mao's latest instructions as a treasure, seeing them as "timely rain" and "sunlight." They said: "Chairman Mao's words are heartwarming, reaching the depths of our hearts." The vast majority of comrades in the two factions began to realize that they are all class brothers and sisters, and the reason they could not unite to fight the enemy in the past was due to the "selfishness" and factionalism. Realizing this, most comrades began to voluntarily expose their shortcomings, fight selfishness, and put forward the slogan: "Expose shortcomings without fear of ugliness, fight selfishness without fear of pain, change selfishness without fear of difficulty." To spark a revolution in the depths of the soul, each hotel held extensive discussions on the benefits of self-criticism, the harm of factionalism, and everyone drew a portrait of "selfishness" and competed to be a pioneer in fighting selfishness, quickly creating a lively atmosphere of fighting selfishness. A worker, after comparing his thoughts with Mao Zedong Thought, deeply felt: "Looking at problems from the perspective of selfishness is one-sided and narrow-minded, the attitude is wrong; looking at problems from the perspective of public interest is objective and fair, and one can engage in self-criticism."

The revolutionary great alliance has been consolidated and developed, and the workers' ideological outlook has been completely transformed.

Through the study of fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism, the broad masses of workers decided to "sweep selfishness out the door and let public interest settle in." The atmosphere of unity and alliance became increasingly strong.

Minzu Hotel, originally divided into two factions, held separate materials and separate struggle meetings during the big criticism sessions. After establishing the study classes, the masses took the initiative to propose combining materials for unified command and unified action, concentrating firepower to criticize the capitalist roaders within the party. As a result, the struggle meeting was very successful.

Peace Hotel, previously had severe opposition between the two factions, accusing each other of being "royalists," "big shots" of the capitalist roaders within the party, "black elements," "black organizations," and so on. Now, the broad revolutionary masses of workers have realized: both sides are victims of the bourgeois reactionary line, and due to the "selfishness" in their minds, they were exploited by bad elements, causing the opposition between the two sides. Now, everyone has concentrated their new and old grievances on the handful of capitalist roaders within the party, working together to criticize the revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev, such as "profit-oriented," "material incentives," "slavery," and "suffering small losses to gain big advantages."

Fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism have inspired the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. Many comrades further realized that selfishness is the natural soil for the growth of capitalism and the ideological poison that disintegrates socialist public economy and subverts the dictatorship of the proletariat. If selfishness is not eliminated, its harm is endless. Some workers said: "If selfishness is not fought and stinks, thoughts will rust. If selfishness is not overthrown, the country will be difficult to protect. If selfishness is not fought and stinks, revisionism will 'revive through selfishness.'"

In the past two months, the Mao Zedong Thought study classes in the hotel system in Beijing have been increasingly successful, promoting the revolutionary great alliance within the hotels by system, industry, and team, and both revolution and production have undergone significant changes. Some comrades, who were originally "enemies," did not speak to each other; after studying, they shook hands, hugged, and became close comrades in fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. Workers summarized their study gains: "Participating in the study classes, the gains are truly significant. Selfishness has been eliminated, burdens have been discarded, relationships have improved, moods have become cheerful, and work has been done better."

    北京市饭店系统毛泽东思想学习班办得好
    职工政治思想面貌焕然一新，迅速实现了按部门革命大联合，为实现革命三结合创造了良好条件
    北京市饭店系统坚决响应毛主席要斗私，批修的伟大号召，在解放军同志的帮助下，九月初先后在香山饭店、民族饭店、新侨饭店、和平宾馆、西苑旅社、华侨大厦、前门饭店、北京饭店等八个单位办起了毛泽东思想学习班。通过学习，光焰无际的毛泽东思想更加深入人心，广大职工的政治思想面貌焕然一新，直接促进和巩固了北京市饭店系统按系统按班组的革命大联合，为实现革命的三结合创造了良好的条件，抓革命促生产形势大好，好人好事层出不穷。职工们异口同声地称赞：“毛泽东思想学习班就是好！”
    千条万条，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威是第一条
    文化大革命以前，北京市的八大饭店是在旧市委直接控制之下的。彭真一伙反革命修正主义分子，为了实现他们复辟资本主义的罪恶目的，疯狂地反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，千方百计压制群众学习毛主席著作，提出所谓“四自”，即：自选内容，自定时间，自觉自愿，自由结合。实际上，就是不让伟大的毛泽东思想在广大职工中传播。他们在各个饭店大搞奖金挂帅，大肆宣传什么：“学好业务当经理，学好英语当翻译，技术过硬吃得开。”职工们连毛主席著作都买不到，闲时只好打扑克，看小说，政治空气十分稀薄。无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，在旧市委执行的资产阶级反动路线的影响下，这八个饭店的职工毫无例外地也分裂成两大派组织。平常在一个科室、一个班组、一个餐厅工作的干部和服务人员，互相对立，严重地影响了饭店系统的革命的大批判、革命的大联合和革命的三结合。
    面对着这一情况，驻饭店系统的解放军同志，经过认真的分析和研究，一致认为：要使毛主席关于革命大联合、革命三结合的伟大指示在北京市饭店系统项项落实，千条万条，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威是第一条。于是，他们在广大职工中反复宣传学习毛泽东思想的伟大意义；反复宣传用战无不胜的毛泽东思想改造世界观的重要性；反复宣传对待毛泽东思想的态度是今天革命和反革命、真革命和假革命的试金石和分水岭；反复宣传学习毛主席著作的态度，是个立场问题，阶级感情问题。尽管两大派职工的对立情绪很严重，有的天天打“内战”，坐不下来或坐不到一块儿学习，但是，解放军同志抓学习毛主席著作的决心坚定不移。他们想尽一切办法，克服重重困难，终于在各个饭店普遍办起了毛泽东思想学习班。有的饭店还带动同行业一齐来办。如新侨饭店带民族餐厅（东来顺）、华侨大厦带北京烤鸭店（全聚德）等等。
    大抓狠抓活思想，激发广大职工自觉地斗私批修
    斗私，并不是一件容易的事情。开始办学习班，由于两大革命群众组织的严重对立，有的人就不愿来。有的来了，也是以“观察员”的身份，抱着走着瞧的态度，你要揭我的底，我就揭你的底。有的是带着“炮弹”来准备辩论一场。双方在选派参加学习班的人员上，也是兵对兵，将对将，有文有武。还有的人对亮私有很大顾虑，一怕说出来对方抓辫子，捞稻草；二怕自己组织的人说是“叛徒”、傻瓜。总之，学员们是带着各种各样的活思想来的。如果这些活思想不解决，学习态度不端正，学习班是很难搞好的。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？
    林彪同志说：“毛泽东思想为广大群众所掌握，就会变成无穷无尽的力量，变成威力无比的精神原子弹。”解放军同志，针对学员们存在的活思想，有计划地组织大家反复学习毛主席的重要指示，学习“老三篇”和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等伟大著作，引导大家严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。并着重组织大家活学活用毛主席的语录：“把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了”、“为人民的利益坚持好的，为人民的利益改正错的”。伟大领袖这些光辉的思想和光辉的字句，大大提高了职工们的无产阶级觉悟。就在这时候，毛主席的最新指示传达下来了：“在工人阶级内部，没有根本的利害冲突。在无产阶级专政下的工人阶级内部，更没有理由一定要分裂成为势不两立的两大派组织。”广大职工对毛主席的最新指示如获至宝，都把它看成是“及时雨”，是“阳光”。他们说：“毛主席的话字字照思想，句句暖心肠，字字句句说到我们心坎上。”两大派组织的绝大部分同志都开始认识到，彼此都是自己的阶级兄弟和姐妹，过去不能团结对敌，就是因为“私”字和派性作怪。觉悟到这一点，大多数同志都开始自觉地亮私、斗私，并且提出了“亮私不怕丑，斗私不怕疼，改私不怕难”的口号。为了在灵魂深处爆发革命，各饭店都大讲自我批评的好处，大摆派性的危害，人人给“私”字画像，人人争当斗私的闯将，很快出现了一个生气勃勃的斗私热潮。有个职工，用毛主席思想对照了自己的思想之后，深有体会地说：“站在私字上看问题，片面、狭隘，态度不对头；站在公字上看问题，客观、公正，能作自我批评。”
    巩固发展了革命大联合，职工思想面貌焕然一新
    经过斗私批修的学习，广大职工决心“把私字扫地出门，让公字安家落户”。团结的气氛，联合的气氛越来越浓。
    民族饭店，原来是两大派，搞大批判时，各搞各的材料，各开各的斗争会。办了学习班以后，群众主动倡议，把材料集中在一起统一指挥，统一作战，集中火力斗争党内走资派。结果，斗争大会开得很成功。
    和平宾馆，前些时两派对立得很厉害，你说我是保皇派，是党内走资派的“大红人”、“修苗子”、“黑爪牙”；我说你是牛鬼蛇神“大本营”、“黑组织”。现在，广大革命职工认识到：双方都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，由于自己头脑中有私字，被坏人钻了空子，造成双方对立。现在，大家都把新仇旧恨，集中到党内一小撮走资派头上，齐心协力，批判中国赫鲁晓夫所推行的“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”、“奴隶主义”、“吃小亏占大便宜”等等修正主义的货色。
    斗私，批修激发了广大职工的革命热情。许多同志进一步认识到，私字是滋长资本主义的天然土壤，是瓦解社会主义公有经济和颠覆无产阶级专政的思想毒菌，私字不除，其害无穷。有的职工说：“私字不斗臭，思想要生锈。私字不倒，江山难保。不把私字斗臭，修正主义就要‘借私还魂’。”
    两个月来，北京市饭店系统的毛泽东思想学习班，越办越好，促进了各饭店按系统、按行业、按班组的革命大联合，革命和生产都发生了很大的变化。有些同志，原来是“冤家对头”，见面不说话；学习后，互相握手、拥抱，结成斗私批修的亲密战友。职工们总结学习收获说：“参加学习班，收获真不小，私字搞臭了，包袱扔掉了，关系改善了，心情舒畅了，工作做得更好了。”
