Chairman Ho Chi Minh writes to female militia soldiers in a commune of Quang Ninh District, Quang Binh Province, commending them for shooting down an American aggressor plane and presenting each of them with a commemorative badge.

In his letter, Chairman Ho Chi Minh encourages the female militia soldiers to train hard, learn from good experiences, and better carry out production and combat tasks.

Chairman Ho Chi Minh says in his letter: "In many places, militia self-defense forces, men, women, and the elderly, have shot down American planes. This is very good."

Chairman Ho Chi Minh calls on all provinces to further promote the competition among militia self-defense forces to shoot down American planes and, together with the people of the whole country, make contributions to the complete defeat of American aggressors.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on October 31, strongly condemning the recent reckless decision by the Thai reactionary regime to send more mercenary troops to South Vietnam to participate in the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement says, "This is an extremely arrogant act of war by the Thai regime against the Vietnamese people, aimed at serving the U.S. imperialists' plot to strengthen and expand the war of aggression against Vietnam."

	The statement sternly warns the Thai reactionary regime: "If it persists in colluding with the U.S. aggressors in Vietnam, it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences that may arise from this."

	The statement concludes by expressing confidence that the struggle of the Thai people under the leadership of the Patriotic Front of Thailand will surely achieve brilliant victories.

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on November 11, strongly condemning the Canadian government's serious crime of providing weapons to U.S. imperialists to slaughter the Vietnamese people.

	The statement points out that Canada has signed multiple contracts with the United States to provide weapons and military equipment worth hundreds of millions of dollars to be used in the war of aggression against Vietnam. This is a serious new step by the Canadian government to serve U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

	The statement strongly protests against the Canadian government's actions in serving U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam and firmly demands that the Canadian government must immediately stop providing weapons to the United States for its aggression against Vietnam.
