The bugle call for the educational revolution has been sounded in the midst of the decisive victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the fervor of resuming classes and making revolution. Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest directive: "To carry out the proletarian educational revolution, we must rely on the broad masses of revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers in the schools, and rely on the activists among them, that is, the revolutionary cadres who are determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." Chairman Mao's great directive points out the reliance for carrying out the educational revolution and sounds the bugle call for the proletarian educational revolution. We, the August 18th Revolutionary Rebels, will certainly not disappoint Chairman Mao's earnest expectations and will swear to carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end!

Last year, when the Cultural Revolution just began, the revolutionary fire that had long been smoldering in the hearts of the students of our Tibetan Language Department erupted like a volcano. We brandished the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, filled with deep hatred for the old educational system, and denounced the reactionary lamas' control over the school. We posted thousands of big-character posters to concentrate our fire on criticizing the textbooks full of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, criticizing the reactionary temple teaching methods, and relentlessly pursuing and attacking the chief culprits of the bourgeois educational line—the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in our province and school.

The great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year have cleared the way for reforming the old educational system and old teaching principles and methods. Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is like a lighthouse, illuminating the bright prospects of the proletarian educational revolution and pointing out the road to its thorough victory. With Chairman Mao leading the way and supporting us, we fear no difficulties. We will "make up our minds, not fear sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." We will blaze trails where none have gone before and scale peaks that none have reached. We will leave the high buildings, go deep into the pastoral areas, and blend with the broad masses of poor herdsmen. Together, we will study Chairman Mao's works, conduct extensive investigations and research, and thoroughly reform Tibetan language teaching through continuous practice.

Whether we can carry the proletarian educational revolution through to the end depends on whether we put Mao Zedong Thought and proletarian politics in command. After resuming classes, if we again bury ourselves in professional courses and adhere to old ways, there can be no talk of educational revolution. This is something we cannot allow. We revolutionary teachers and students will not tolerate bourgeois intellectuals and reactionary lamas and living Buddhas riding roughshod over us again, nor will we allow the feudal dregs and monsters to poison our younger brothers and sisters. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strengthen ideological and political work, and further launch a torrent of criticism against the revisionist educational line. We will strive to establish a proletarian educational system bathed in the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought!

    吹响了教育革命的进军号
    青海大学师院藏文系八·一八革命造反派
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的大好形势下，在复课闹革命的热潮中，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席发出了最新指示：“进行无产阶级教育革命，要依靠学校中广大革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，要依靠他们中间的积极分子，即决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。”毛主席的这一伟大指示，指明了进行教育革命的依靠力量，吹响了无产阶级教育革命的进军号。我们八·一八无产阶级革命派一定不辜负毛主席的殷切期望，誓将无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    去年，文化大革命刚兴起的时候，长期蕴藏在我们藏文系学生心中的革命烈火就象火山一样爆发了。我们奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，怀着对旧教育制度的深仇大恨，控诉了反动喇嘛对学校的统治，千百张大字报集中火力批判了充满着封建主义、资本主义、修正主义毒素的教材，批判了反动透顶的寺院教学法，而且穷追猛打资产阶级教育路线的罪魁祸首——中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在我省我校的代理人。
    一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，为改革旧的教育制度、改革旧的教学方针和方法扫清了道路。毛主席的“五·七”指示，象灯塔一样，照亮了无产阶级教育革命的光辉前景，指明了取得教育革命彻底胜利的道路。有毛主席给我们领路，有毛主席给我们撑腰，我们什么困难都不怕，我们要“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”前人没有走过的路，我们要闯；前人没有到达的高峰，我们来攀登。我们要走出高楼大厦，深入牧区，同广大贫苦牧民打成一片，共同学习毛主席著作，进行广泛的调查研究，在不断实践中彻底改革藏文教学。
    能不能把无产阶级教育革命进行到底，关键在于是不是突出毛泽东思想，突出无产阶级政治。复课以后，如果再一头钻进业务课，因循守旧，那就谈不上教育革命。这是我们决不能允许的。我们革命师生决不能容忍资产阶级知识分子、反动喇嘛活佛重新骑在我们头上作威作福，决不能容忍那些封建糟粕、牛鬼蛇神再来毒害我们的弟弟妹妹。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，加强思想政治工作，进一步掀起批判修正主义教育路线的热潮，为创立一个毛泽东思想光辉普照的红彤彤的无产阶级教育制度而努力奋斗！
