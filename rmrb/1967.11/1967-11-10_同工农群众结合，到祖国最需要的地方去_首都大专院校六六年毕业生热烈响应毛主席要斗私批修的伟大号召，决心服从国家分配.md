In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the 1966 graduates of colleges and universities in the capital, who have undergone the tempering, testing, and education of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two paths, have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." They have decided to follow Chairman Mao's great teaching of "wholeheartedly serving the people" and obey the state's allocation, unite with the workers and peasants, and go to where the socialist revolution and socialist construction are most needed.

The 1966 graduates of colleges and universities in the capital are completely nurtured by New China. Over the past 18 years, they have participated in the great political movements personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao, and grown and tempered under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. Especially in the world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they have undergone the baptism of struggle and, in the struggle against the capitalist-roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev, have raised their political consciousness and tempered their revolutionary will. They have unlimited love, faith, reverence, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao. Most of them dare to venture, dare to act, and dare to revolutionize, have a high degree of political sensitivity, and are determined to follow the path of uniting with workers, peasants, and soldiers as pointed out by Chairman Mao.

This time, the allocation of graduates is taking place at a crucial moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved decisive victories and when Chairman Mao has issued the great call to "fight selfishness and criticize revisionism." The graduates who accept the allocation consciously regard this allocation as a new battle in the Cultural Revolution and as a classroom and examination ground for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism. They study the "Three Articles" extensively, use Chairman Mao's teachings to examine themselves, conduct self-examinations, thoroughly criticize selfishness, and firmly establish public spirit. Chairman Mao's instructions on serving the people completely, thoroughly, and wholeheartedly have become the sole standard for them to examine their thoughts and actions. To thoroughly criticize selfishness, many students voluntarily expose their thoughts to the leadership and comrades, seeking everyone's help, and use the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and solve problems. Many graduates believe that how to correctly handle the issue of graduate allocation is a severe test for both revolutionary pioneers and relatively backward students in the Cultural Revolution. Is it the proletarian spirit of public interest first, or is it the bourgeois spirit of selfishness? Is it to prioritize revolutionary interests and obey the state's allocation, or is it to act individualistically and practice liberalism? This is actually a major issue of whether one dares to take oneself as a revolutionary object and a major issue of whether one is loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate that intellectuals go to the masses, go to the factories, go to the countryside." "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the masses' struggle and grow in the tempering of great revolutionary storms and waves." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the majority of graduates, in filling out their graduate allocation forms recently, have expressed their determination to go to the factories, go to the countryside, go to the grassroots, go to the places where the motherland needs them most and where the work is most arduous, to roll in the mud and get oily in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, and to temper themselves into steadfast proletarian revolutionary warriors who are forever loyal to Chairman Mao, and into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause that Chairman Mao expects. More than 90% of the graduates have unanimously written on their forms that "obeying the state's allocation" is their first choice. Some students wrote on their forms: "Firmly obey the party's allocation, go to the workers and peasants, go to the most arduous places!" Some students expressed: "The sunlight of the party for more than ten years has made me grow vigorously. The nourishment of Mao Zedong Thought for more than ten years has made this sapling of the motherland grow into a useful tree. All that I have is given by the party and Chairman Mao. My entire life is entrusted to the party to arrange!" Some students, full of revolutionary passion, wrote: "Dear party, choose me! Wish our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life!"

In the graduate allocation work, to implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, more than 30 colleges and universities in Beijing have successively established revolutionary "three-in-one" leadership teams for graduate allocation, responsible for leading the identification and allocation of graduates. These leadership teams, different from the institutions that have been responsible for graduate allocation in the past, show a new spiritual outlook brought by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Most of them, once established, have vigorously eliminated the capitalist line of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power headed by China's Khrushchev in the graduate allocation work, and have vigorously eliminated the exploitative class ideas of material incentives and laziness they have spread. These leadership teams emphasize politics, focus on political and ideological work, fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and implement democratic centralism, resolutely and comprehensively implement the party's class line. Many schools, while organizing graduates to study Chairman Mao's works, also invite active elements from the People's Liberation Army who study Chairman Mao's works, workers, and poor and lower-middle peasants to give reports to the graduates and hold small-scale symposiums, strengthening the political and ideological work of the graduates.

The graduate allocation work of the 1966 graduates of colleges and universities in the capital is currently underway. Soon, they will set out to various parts of the motherland, embarking on a new revolutionary journey.

### 同工农群众结合，到祖国最需要的地方去  首都大专院校六六年毕业生热烈响应毛主席要斗私批修的伟大号召，决心服从国家分配

    同工农群众结合，到祖国最需要的地方去
    首都大专院校六六年毕业生热烈响应毛主席要斗私批修的伟大号召，决心服从国家分配
    新华社九日讯　在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，经受了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的锻炼、考验和教育的一九六六年首都大专院校毕业生，热烈响应毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，决心按照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的伟大教导，服从国家分配，同工农群众相结合，到社会主义革命和社会主义建设最需要的地方去。
    首都一九六六年毕业的这批大学生，是完全由新中国哺育起来的。十八年来，他们参加了伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的一系列伟大的政治运动，在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下锻炼成长。特别是在震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命中，他们经受了战斗的洗礼，在同以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，提高了政治觉悟，锤炼了革命意志。他们对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱、无限信仰、无限崇拜、无限忠诚。他们大多数敢闯、敢干、敢革命，有较高的政治敏感性，决心走毛主席指出的同工农兵结合的道路。
    这次毕业生分配，是在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的关键时刻和毛主席发出“斗私，批修”的伟大号召下进行的。接受分配的毕业生，自觉地把这次毕业分配当作是他们参加文化大革命的一次新战役，当作是活学活用毛主席著作的课堂和“斗私，批修”的考场。他们大学大用“老三篇”，用毛主席的教导对照自己，进行检查，大挖“私”字，大立“公”字。毛主席关于为人民服务要完全、彻底和全心全意的指示，成了他们检验自己的思想、言行的唯一标准。为了搞臭“私”字，不少同学自觉地向领导上和同志们亮出自己的思想，争取大家帮助，用光焰无际的毛泽东思想来加以分析和解决。许多毕业生认为，如何正确对待毕业分配问题，无论是对文化大革命中的革命闯将还是比较后进的同学，都是一次严峻的考验。是无产阶级“公”字当头，还是受资产阶级的“私”字支配？是以革命利益为重服从国家分配，还是从个人主义出发实行自由主义？这实际上是一个敢不敢把自己作为革命对象的重大问题，是一个是不是忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的重大问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们提倡知识分子到群众中去，到工厂去，到农村去。”“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”遵照毛主席的教导，广大毕业生在最近填写毕业分配志愿时，纷纷表示决心，要到工厂去，到农村去，到基层去，到祖国最需要、工作最艰苦的地方去，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中滚一身泥巴，沾一身油污，把自己锻炼成为永远忠于毛主席的坚定的无产阶级革命战士，成为毛主席所期望的无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。百分之九十以上的毕业生，不约而同地在志愿表上把“服从国家分配”作为第一志愿。有些同学在志愿表上写道：“坚决服从党的分配，到工农群众中去，到最艰苦的地方去！”有的同学表示：“十几年党的阳光的照耀使我茁壮地成长起来。十几年毛泽东思想雨露的滋润使我这个祖国的幼苗长成材。我所有的一切，都是党和毛主席给的。我的整个生命交给党来安排！”还有些同学满怀革命的激情写道：“敬爱的党，任您挑选吧！祝我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    在毕业分配工作中，为了贯彻执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，北京三十多所大专院校，先后建立了革命“三结合”的毕业生分配领导班子，负责领导毕业生的鉴定和分配工作。这些领导班子和往年负责分配毕业生的机构不同，表现出无产阶级文化大革命所带来的新的精神面貌。它们当中的大多数一经成立，就大力破除党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在毕业生分配工作中所推行的资产阶级反动路线，大力破除他们所散布的物质刺激、好逸恶劳的剥削阶级思想。这些领导班子突出政治，狠抓政治思想工作，充分相信群众，依靠群众，走群众路线，贯彻民主集中制，坚决地、全面地贯彻执行党的阶级路线。许多学校在组织毕业生学习毛主席著作的同时，还请解放军学习毛主席著作积极分子、工人和贫下中农给毕业生作报告，召开小型座谈会等，加强毕业生的政治思想工作。
    首都一九六六年大专院校毕业生的分配工作，目前正在进行。不久，他们就要陆续奔赴祖国的四面八方，踏上新的革命征途。
