In the brilliant light of the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought, under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production fronts in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region present a very good situation.

At present, cities, rural areas, and vast pastoral regions throughout the region are surging forward with revolutionary waves, and production bulletins are being reported everywhere. On the industrial front, the coal production of the autonomous region is steadily increasing, and the labor attendance rate has generally improved. The state-owned coal mines in the Tselingol, Jirim, Zhaowuda, Ejin, and Bayannur Leagues have all completed and exceeded the coal production plans for the month and quarter. According to statistics from seventy-four key enterprises in the light industry department, the total output value for the first nine months of this year increased by 10% compared to the same period last year. Among the ten main products, such as paper, sugar, dairy products, fertilizers, and soap, all showed significant growth compared to the same period last year. On the agricultural front, this year's summer grain harvest in the entire region achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest, with a 20% increase in production compared to last year. The autumn crops also had a good harvest, and the production of oilseeds and sugar beets exceeded last year's, with sugar beet production increasing by more than 50% compared to last year. In the western region of the autonomous region, which has experienced nine years of drought in ten, the crops this year generally had a bumper harvest. Bayannur League, one of the main grain-producing areas of the autonomous region, and the Ulanqab and Tselingol Leagues in the Yinshan Mountains north and south, saw agricultural production increase by 10% to 30% compared to last year. Now, from the Hetao Plain to the Xiliao River Plain, from the Yinshan Mountains north and south to the foothills of the Greater Khingan Mountains, revolutionary farmers and revolutionary cadres of various ethnic groups have successfully completed the harvesting tasks and are now concentrating their efforts on threshing and delivering new grain to the state.

During the 1967 livestock production year from July last year to June this year, the livestock production in the entire region also had a bumper harvest. In this year, the total number of large and small livestock bred and raised in the entire region reached more than 11 million head, an increase of nearly 2.6 million head compared to the previous year. The total number of livestock increased by 1.57 million head based on last year's figures, exceeding the state plan. The development of state-owned farms and collective livestock in people's communes far surpassed any previous year. The number of draft horses and mules this year increased by 8% and 15% respectively compared to last year. In particular, the number of famous Sanhe cattle, Sanhe horses, and fine-wool sheep increased by more than 23% compared to the previous year. Currently, the fat condition of various livestock generally exceeds last year's level. The newborn young livestock are even more fat and strong, generally exceeding 90% fat. In the largest grassland pastoral area of Inner Mongolia—the Tselingol League—most of the large and small livestock have reached full fat. Currently, most of the livestock in the entire region have undergone deworming, medication baths, and preventive injections, and the physical condition of various livestock is very robust.

After achieving a bumper harvest in livestock production, the revolutionary herdsmen of various ethnic groups actively sell livestock products to the state to support the socialist construction of the motherland. Currently, various places in the autonomous region have provided the state with more than 3 million head of draft and meat livestock and a large amount of wool and fur.

The bumper harvest of industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production in Inner Mongolia this year is the result of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the autonomous region, in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production." It is another triumphant song of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought.

This spring, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in the Inner Mongolia region stirred up a counter-revolutionary tide of capitalist restoration. They incited workers, farmers, and herdsmen of various ethnic groups to leave their production posts, or spread rumors and slander, stir up trouble, and provoke armed struggles, attempting to disrupt production, disrupt the collective economy, and disrupt the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in order to realize their dream of restoring capitalism. Under the guidance of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary workers, farmers, and herdsmen of various ethnic groups firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, earnestly implemented Chairman Mao's great line of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," and repeatedly thwarted the plots and tricks of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses of the Huhhot Machine Tool Factory, in the great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, achieved revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination after realizing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, fully demonstrated the wisdom and strength of the working class, not only made progress in production management and production technology, but also made the monthly output from June to September this year exceed the highest monthly output in history by 16% to 43%.

In the great struggle and criticism, the revolutionary workers, farmers, and herdsmen of various ethnic groups launched a great struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their agents in the Inner Mongolia region. Herdsmen compared the Chinese Khrushchev to wolves on the grasslands. They said: No matter how vicious the wolf is, it cannot escape the herdsmen's lasso; no matter how ferocious the class enemy is, it cannot resist the dictatorship of the proletariat. Revolutionary workers, farmers, herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres strongly criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents for pushing various capitalist and revisionist goods in the cities, rural areas, and pastoral regions of Inner Mongolia. Through the great struggle and criticism, the broad masses of workers, farmers, and herdsmen further raised their class consciousness, had a deep understanding of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, and their revolutionary enthusiasm soared.

In the struggle to achieve this year's bumper harvest in agriculture and pastoral production and support industrial production and construction, the great People's Liberation Army made tremendous contributions.

Currently, the revolutionary workers, farmers, herdsmen, and revolutionary cadres of various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, in accordance with the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, are taking "struggling against selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key link, further launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carrying out revolutionary great struggle and criticism, consolidating and developing revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination, seizing the revolution, and vigorously promoting production, laying a solid foundation for achieving greater successes in industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production next year.

		November 1, Premier Zhou Enlai received Vietnamese Democratic Republic Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, Nguyen Minh Loan (second from left).

		Chairman Mao said: "In places and units where it is necessary to seize power, the policy of revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' must be implemented to establish a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative temporary power organ of the proletariat. The name of this power organ is good to be called the Revolutionary Committee."

		Leaders of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee, carrying a sign written in Mongolian and Chinese that reads "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee," celebrate the birth of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee with revolutionary masses.

		Chairman Mao said: "Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people."

		The Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Inner Mongolia resolutely supports the broad revolutionary masses of the left, and in the "three supports, two militaries" work, in defending the motherland's borders and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has established immortal merits. Today, they celebrate the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee with the people of various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. They are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and create new merits for the people in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

		Revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region sing and dance, celebrating the victory of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Inner Mongolia in the struggle to seize power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, celebrating the victory of the great unity and three-in-one combination of the proletarian revolutionary factions and the people of various ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, and celebrating the birth of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee.

    坚决贯彻执行毛主席抓革命促生产的伟大方针
    内蒙古工农牧业生产一派大好形势
    各族革命工人、农民、牧民和革命干部，正以斗私批修为纲，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为明年工农牧业生产取得更大成就打下良好基础
    新华社呼和浩特二十八日电　在伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命运动的推动下，内蒙古自治区的工、农、牧业生产战线呈现出一派大好形势。
    目前，全区城市、农村和广大牧区，革命浪潮滚滚向前，生产捷报到处频传。在工业战线上，自治区煤炭的产量正在稳步上升，劳动出勤率普遍有了新的提高。锡林郭勒、哲里木、昭乌达、伊克昭、巴彦淖尔等盟的地方国营煤矿，都按月按季完成和超额完成了煤炭生产计划。据轻化工业部门的七十四个重点企业的统计，今年一至九月份的总产值比去年同期增长百分之十，其中十种主要产品，如纸、糖、乳品、化肥、肥皂等都比去年同期有显著增长。在农业战线上，今年全区夏粮获得了历史上少有的丰收，产量比去年增长两成。大秋作物也得到了良好收成，油料、甜菜的产量都超过去年，其中甜菜产量比去年增长百分之五十以上。在十年九旱的自治区西部地区，今年的农作物普遍获得丰收。自治区主要产粮区之一的巴彦淖尔盟和阴山南北的乌兰察布盟、锡林郭勒盟，农业产量分别比去年增产一成到三成。现在，从黄河后套到西辽河平原，从阴山南北到大兴安岭脚下，各族革命农民和革命干部已胜利完成收割任务，正集中力量登场碾打和向国家交售新粮。
    在从去年七月到今年六月的一九六七年畜牧业生产年度里，全区畜牧业生产也获得了丰收。在这一年里，全区接育的大小牲畜达一千一百多万头，比上年度增长将近二百六十万头。牲畜总头数在去年的基础上净增一百五十七万多头，超额完成了国家计划。各国营牧场和人民公社集体牲畜的发展，大大超过了以往任何一年。今年的耕马、耕骡头数，分别比去年增长百分之八和百分之十五。特别是著名的三河牛、三河马和细毛羊良种牲畜头数，比上年度增长百分之二十三以上。现在，各种牲畜的膘情普遍超过去年水平。新生仔畜更是膘肥体壮，一般都超过九成膘。内蒙古最大草原牧区——锡林郭勒盟大小牲畜绝大部分达到了满膘。目前，全区绝大部分牲畜都经过驱虫、药浴和防疫注射，各种牲畜的体质十分健壮。
    各族革命牧民在取得畜牧业生产丰收之后，积极向国家出售畜产品，支援祖国社会主义建设。目前，自治区各地已向国家提供了三百多万头耕畜、肉畜和大量绒毛皮张。
    内蒙古工农牧业生产今年获得丰收，是自治区各族无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，活学活用毛主席著作，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一曲凯歌。
    今年春天，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在内蒙古地区的代理人，掀起了一股资本主义复辟的反革命逆流。他们煽动各族工人、农民和牧民，脱离生产岗位，或者造谣中伤，挑拨离间，挑起武斗，妄图破坏生产，破坏集体经济，破坏无产阶级文化大革命，实现其复辟资本主义的迷梦。各族革命的工人、农民和牧民在以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，认真贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，一次又一次地击退了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋诡计和反革命伎俩。呼和浩特机床厂的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争中，实现了革命的大联合和革命的三结合以后，充分发挥了工人阶级的智慧和力量，不但在生产管理和生产技术上有所创造，有所前进，并且使今年六至九月份的月产量分别超过历年最高月产量百分之十六到百分之四十三。
    在革命的大批判中，各族革命的工人、农民和牧民，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在内蒙古地区的代理人展开了大批判、大斗争。牧民们把中国的赫鲁晓夫比做草原上的豺狼。他们说：豺狼再恶，也逃不脱牧民的套马杆子；阶级敌人再凶，也抗不了无产阶级专政。革命的工人、农民、牧民和革命干部有力地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人在内蒙古的城市、农村和牧区推行的各种资本主义、修正主义货色。通过大批判，广大工人、农民、牧民进一步提高了阶级觉悟，对两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，有了深刻的认识，革命干劲大大高涨。
    在夺取今年农牧业丰收和支援工业生产建设上，伟大的人民解放军做出了巨大的贡献。
    目前，内蒙古各族革命的工人、农民、牧民和革命干部，正遵照伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示，以“斗私，批修”为纲，进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，开展革命的大批判，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，狠抓革命，猛促生产，为明年工农牧业生产取得更大成就打下良好基础。
