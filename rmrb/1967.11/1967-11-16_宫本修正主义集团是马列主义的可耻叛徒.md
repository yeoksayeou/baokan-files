	“Once the winds of change sweep the land, the bones of the dead will dance.”
	In the midst of the resounding victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, the domestic and foreign class enemies staged a farce of anti-China hysteria. In this farce, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist faction, Yoshio Miyamoto, played a particularly enthusiastic role.

	Yoshio Miyamoto, the so-called "General Secretary" of the Japanese Communist Party, is a man who, with his elegant attire and dignified demeanor, proudly wears a label of "orthodox Marxist-Leninist." However, when placed under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, he reveals himself to be a true "nurse of capitalism," a yes-man to Soviet modern revisionism, and a traitor to Marxism-Leninism.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without them, it is impossible to achieve the leap in social development, to overthrow the reactionary ruling class, and to enable the people to seize power."

	However, the Japanese Communist Party's revisionist faction, which places its hopes on the ballot box and views violent revolution as a plague, pins all its hopes on the "parliamentary road." In a 1961 report to the Japanese Communist Party Central Committee on the draft program, Yoshio Miyamoto blatantly declared: "Our party... believes that the possibility of a peaceful transition is in the interests of the working class and all the people, as well as the entire nation. We will, of course, do everything in our power to realize this possibility." The Miyamoto faction, facing the aggressive forces of American imperialism and the reactionary rule of Japanese militarism, dare not fight back, and blindly claim that "if we can secure a stable majority in the Diet, we can turn the Diet from a tool of reactionary rule into a tool for serving the people."

	As late as this April, the Japanese Communist Party's *Akahata* newspaper, in a long and stinking article titled "The Emperor's Birthday," still raved about how "as long as the reactionary forces do not use violence to block the path of peaceful transition, our party will strive with all its might to realize the possibility of a peaceful transition." If there is anyone in the world who is blinded by money, then the self-proclaimed Marxist-Leninists Miyamoto and Nosaka are probably blinded by the ballot box. If you don't believe it, the facts speak for themselves:

	As far back as 1962, at the suggestion of another leader of the Japanese Communist Party, Nosaka Sanzo, the leaders of the Japanese Communist Party at a press conference cheered for the so-called "victory" of the Japanese Communist Party in the elections. Recently, because the Japanese revolutionary faction and the Chinese Red Guards have exposed their true colors, the Miyamoto faction has gone into a hysterical frenzy, claiming that "this is an attempt to reduce our party's votes in the general election." They are so overjoyed by a few extra votes, so ecstatic, and so devastated by a few fewer votes, as if they had lost a parent. They truly deserve to be called the greatest "parliamentary maniacs" and "ballot box addicts" of the contemporary world!

	Lenin said: "Only a scoundrel or a fool would think that the proletariat should first secure a majority through voting under the oppression of the bourgeoisie and wage slavery, and then seize power. This is the height of stupidity or the height of hypocrisy, replacing class struggle and revolution with voting under the old system and old regime."

	Doesn't the Japanese Communist Party's faction boast of being orthodox "Marxist-Leninists"? However, in the face of the brilliant Marxism-Leninism, they have exposed themselves to be a bunch of utterly stupid scoundrels!

	Lenin once pointed out to the blowhards of the "parliamentary road" in the Second International: "They have degenerated to the point of becoming ordinary 'nurses of capitalism.'" Today, bestowing the "crown" of "nurses of capitalism" on the Miyamoto faction is not at all inappropriate!

	The Miyamoto faction follows the Soviet revisionist faction, not only pushing the "peaceful transition" and "parliamentary road" at home, but also advocating a counter-revolutionary revisionist line internationally. They put lipstick on the Soviet revisionist faction, saying that the Soviet Union has only a bit of a "revisionist tendency." Even more despicable, the Miyamoto faction attempts to pull the Soviet revisionist faction, the number one accomplice of the American Empire, which betrays the interests of the people of various countries, into the international anti-American united front, and under the pretext of "maintaining international unity," insists on carrying out some "international unified action" against imperialism with the Soviet revisionist traitor faction.

	What a "unified international action" against imperialism!

	In Glassboro, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin engaged in a filthy global deal with the world's greatest war criminal, Johnson, betraying the interests of the Vietnamese people, the Arab people, and the people of the world. However, the Miyamoto faction shamelessly defended Kosygin, claiming that "it is incorrect to treat this meeting as the same problem as the previous two meetings held by Khrushchev," and disgustingly praised Kosygin for still taking a "stance of condemning American imperialism's aggression against Vietnam" in this meeting. Look, dressing up the world's greatest traitor faction as heroes against American imperialism, this is the Miyamoto faction's so-called "unified international action" against imperialism!

	To cover up their shameful crimes of betraying the Arab people, the Soviet revisionist faction staged a farce of the thief crying "catch the thief" at the United Nations. The Miyamoto faction followed suit, repeatedly praising it, claiming that the struggle at the United Nations Emergency Special Session "has a certain positive significance in isolating American imperialism and the reactionary ruling class of Israel, and supporting the Arab people."

	Ironclad facts prove that this is not an "international unified action" against imperialism, but a genuine "unified action" of the Japanese Communist Party colluding with the American Empire, the Soviet revisionists, and the Japanese reactionaries to engage in large-scale anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary activities! This is the "unified action" of all the ghosts and monsters in the world!

	The Miyamoto faction completely follows the Soviet revisionist faction's baton, calling them the yes-men of Soviet modern revisionism. Is there any injustice in this?

	Now, the world has entered a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner.

	Chairman Mao is the Lenin of our time. Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards world victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Today, whoever attacks the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, whoever betrays Marxism-Leninism at its root, becomes a traitor to Marxism-Leninism.

	The Miyamoto faction talks big about "taking Marxism-Leninism as the sole theoretical and practical guide," but in reality, they engage in evil deeds of opposing Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They claim that promoting Mao Zedong Thought internationally is a "tragic mistake," and maliciously slander the world's people's boundless love for Chairman Mao as "blind obedience." They secretly order the Japanese Communist Party at all levels to remove Chairman Mao's portrait, prohibit the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works, and even forbid the screening of films with scenes of Chairman Mao. They fear Mao Zedong Thought like rats fear the sun.

	The Miyamoto faction fiercely attacks the Japanese revolutionary people's love for Chairman Mao and their efforts to study Mao Zedong Thought, claiming that this is "foreign blind obedience." This is a huge joke. Dear Mr. Miyamoto, as a true Marxist-Leninist, isn't learning and promoting Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought their most legitimate and sacred duty? And you, wearing the cloak of a Communist Party member, engaging in the despicable act of mutilating Marxism-Leninism and attacking Mao Zedong Thought, isn't this precisely proof that you are a bunch of traitors to Marxism-Leninism who blindly follow the American Empire and the Soviet revisionists?

	The Miyamoto faction's vicious attack on Mao Zedong Thought is not accidental. This is the inevitable result of their capitulation to the American Empire and the Soviet revisionists. Since the Miyamoto faction advocates a counter-revolutionary revisionist line at home and abroad, it must inevitably stand in fundamental opposition to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and must inevitably stand in fundamental opposition to the Communist Party of China, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is the fundamental opposition between upholding Marxism-Leninism and betraying Marxism-Leninism, the fundamental opposition between revolution and counter-revolution.

	The Miyamoto faction, following the American Empire and the Soviet revisionists, fiercely opposes China and viciously attacks Mao Zedong Thought, which is completely contrary to the will and wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, and is extremely unpopular. The counter-revolutionary revisionist face of the Miyamoto faction has been exposed by the Japanese revolutionary people, and the life of the Miyamoto faction will not be long. Now, the left wing of the Japanese Communist Party is making a big fuss, and this is the new dawn on the land of Japan.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao points out: "The future of the Japanese people is bright," and "the Japanese people have hope." We firmly believe that a brand new, truly Japanese Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, will be born in the flames of the struggle against the Miyamoto faction.

### 宫本修正主义集团是马列主义的可耻叛徒

    宫本修正主义集团是马列主义的可耻叛徒
    宏任达
    “一从大地起风雷，便有精生白骨堆。”
    在我国无产阶级文化大革命取得辉煌胜利的凯歌声中，国内外阶级敌人合演了一场狂犬吠日的反华丑剧。在这出丑剧中，日共修正主义头目宫本显治之流扮演了一个颇为卖劲的角色。
    宫本显治者，堂堂的日修“总书记”也。此人衣冠楚楚，道貌岸然，额上自贴一张正统的“马列主义者”标签。然而把他拿到毛泽东思想的照妖镜下一照，原来是一个货真价实的“资本主义看护妇”，苏联现代修正主义的应声虫，马克思列宁主义的可耻叛徒。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    然而宫本修正主义集团，以选票为命，视暴力革命如洪水猛兽，把一切希望寄托于“议会道路”上。宫本显治在一九六一年日修中央关于纲领（草案）的报告中赤裸裸地叫嚷：“我党……认为实现和平过渡的可能性是符合工人阶级和全体人民的利益、也符合整个民族利益的，我们当然要为实现这种可能性而全力以赴。”宫本集团面对美帝国主义的侵略势力和日本军国主义的反动统治，不敢斗争，闭着眼睛瞎说什么“如果能够在国会中拥有稳定的过半数，就能够把国会从反动统治的工具变成为为人民服务的工具”。
    直到今年四月，日修《赤旗报》在那篇又长又臭的所谓“天长节论文”里，还狂叫什么：“只要反动势力不用暴力堵塞革命和平过渡的道路，我们党就要为实现和平过渡的可能性而竭尽全力进行奋斗。”如果说，世界上有一种人是财迷心窍的话，那末，自命信奉马列主义的宫本、野坂，大概是让选票迷住心窍了吧？如不信，有事实为证：
    远在一九六二年，在日修另一个头目野坂参三的提议下，出席记者招待会的日修头目竟为日修在选举中的所谓“胜利”高呼万岁。而最近，因为日本革命派和中国红卫兵揭了他们的底，宫本之流则歇斯底里大发作，胡说什么“这是企图使我党在大选中选票减少”。多了几张选票如此兴高彩烈，神魂颠倒，少了几张选票就这样痛心疾首，如丧考妣，真不愧为当代最大的“议会狂”和“选票迷”！
    列宁说：“只有坏蛋或者傻瓜才会认为，无产阶级应当首先利用资产阶级压迫下和雇佣奴隶制压迫下进行的投票方式取得多数，然后才去夺取政权。这是绝顶的愚蠢或绝顶的虚伪，这是用旧制度旧政权下的投票来代替阶级斗争和革命。”
    宫本集团不是吹嘘自己是正统的“马列主义者”吗？然而在光辉的马克思列宁主义面前，正好暴露了他们自己是一群绝顶愚蠢的坏蛋！
    列宁曾经对第二国际“议会道路”的吹鼓手，一针见血地指出：“他们已经堕落到充当普通的‘资本主义看护妇’的地步”。今天，把“资本主义看护妇”这顶“桂冠”奉送给宫本之流，岂不十分合适吗！
    宫本集团追随苏修集团，不仅在国内大搞什么“和平过渡”、“议会道路”，而且在国际上也推行了一条反革命修正主义路线。他们为苏修集团涂脂抹粉，说什么苏联只是有点“修正主义的倾向”。更卑鄙的是，宫本集团竟妄图把美帝的头号帮凶、出卖各国人民利益的苏修集团拉进国际反美统一战线，并且打出“维护国际团结”的幌子，硬要同苏修叛徒集团搞什么反帝的“国际统一行动”。
    好一个反帝的“国际统一行动”！
    在葛拉斯堡罗，苏修头子柯西金同世界最大的战犯约翰逊进行肮脏的全球性的大交易，出卖越南人民、阿拉伯人民和世界人民的利益。但是，宫本集团却强词夺理地为柯西金辩解，说什么把这次会谈同“赫鲁晓夫所作的前两次会谈当成完全一样的问题来对待是不正确的”，肉麻地吹捧柯西金在这次会谈中还是采取了“谴责美帝国主义的侵略越南政策的态度”。请看，把世界上最大的叛徒集团梳妆打扮成反对美帝的“英雄”，这就是宫本集团的所谓反帝“统一行动”！
    苏修集团为了掩盖它出卖阿拉伯人民的可耻罪行，在联合国搞了一出贼喊捉贼的丑剧，宫本集团也紧跟上来，一再加以捧场，胡说什么联合国紧急特别大会上的斗争“在孤立美帝国主义和以色列反动统治阶层，支援阿拉伯人民方面具有一定的积极意义”。
    铁一般的事实证明，这那里是什么反帝“统一行动”，这是地地道道的日修同美帝、苏修和日本反动派联合起来，大肆反华、反人民、反革命的“统一行动”！这是国际上一切牛鬼蛇神的“统一行动”！
    宫本集团完全跟着苏修的指挥棒转，将他们称作为苏联现代修正主义的应声虫，难道还有什么冤枉的吗？！
    现在，世界已经进入了以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。
    毛主席是当代的列宁。毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。今天，谁攻击世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席，攻击战无不胜的毛泽东思想，谁就从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义，堕落成为马克思列宁主义的可耻叛徒。
    宫本集团嘴上侈谈什么“要把马列主义作为唯一的理论指导和行动指南”，实际上却大干反对毛主席、反对毛泽东思想的罪恶勾当。他们胡说什么在国际上宣传毛泽东思想是犯了“悲剧性的错误”，并且恶毒污蔑世界人民对毛主席的无比的热爱是“盲从”。他们秘密命令日共各级机关摘下毛主席的肖像，禁止出版发行毛主席著作，连有毛主席镜头的电影也不准放映。他们象耗子怕见太阳一样害怕毛泽东思想。
    宫本集团疯狂地攻击日本革命人民热爱毛主席、努力学习毛泽东思想是什么“对外盲从主义”，这真是天大的笑话。可爱的宫本先生，作为一个真正的马克思列宁主义者，学习和宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，这难道不是他们最天经地义的、最神圣的职责吗？而你们，披着共产党员的外衣，大干阉割马克思列宁主义，攻击毛泽东思想的卑劣勾当，这不正好说明你们自己是一伙十足的盲从美帝、盲从苏修的马克思列宁主义最可耻的叛徒吗？
    宫本集团恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，这绝不是偶然的。这是他们投靠美帝、苏修的必然结果。宫本集团既然在国内外推行一条反革命修正主义路线，它就必然要同马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想发生根本的对立，必然要同高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国共产党发生根本的对立。这是坚持马克思列宁主义与背叛马克思列宁主义之间的根本对立，是革命与反革命之间的根本对立。
    宫本集团追随美帝、苏修疯狂反华，恶毒攻击毛泽东思想，是完全违背日本广大人民的意志和愿望的，是极不得人心的。宫本集团的反革命修正主义嘴脸已被日本革命人民识破，宫本集团的寿命是长不了的。现在日共左派大造其反，这是日本大地上的新曙光。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“日本人民的前途是光明的”，“日本人民是有希望的”。我们坚信，一个崭新的、高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的、真正的日本共产党，必将在反对宫本集团的斗争烈火中诞生。
