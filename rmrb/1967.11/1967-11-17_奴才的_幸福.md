Title: The "Happiness" of a Lackey

The "happiness" that the Soviet revisionist leadership wants Soviet literature to become the "mouthpiece of the struggle for human happiness."

What is their so-called "human happiness"? In his novel *The Living and the Dead*, Simonov answers:

"Happiness" is "bread." Even if it's "a piece of dry bread as big as a half brick," if one can eat "canned food," then it would be even more "happy";
"Happiness" is "fashion." One can have a bed with "wrinkled, unironed sheets," wear a "clean linen shirt," and even have the "fragrance of perfume";
"Happiness" is a woman's "gentle little hand." "Hope that this hand will take off his clothes, bathe him, and put him to bed"...

How disgusting! How filthy! This is the stinking trash from Khrushchev's garbage can! Didn't Khrushchev and his ilk already depict the "happiness" of "communist" life as "potatoes with beef" and "coats with boots"? The "happiness" that Simonov advocates is the explanatory diagram of this reactionary program.

Simonov has his protagonist, Sintsoff, participate in the Patriotic War, enduring long periods of "hunger and cold" and "many times the torment of fear of death," only to return home to live this "happy" life.

This is to tell everyone:

Do you want to live a "happy" life? Then you must be like Sintsoff, seeing the enemy's car lights, "not even having time to put on his boots," "only able to grab the boots and socks in his hand, climbing out the window," "running several kilometers in one breath" to escape.

Do you want to live a "happy" life? Then you must be like Sintsoff, when the German devil shouts: "Halt!" (Stop), he obediently "raises his hands" to become a traitor.

Do you want to live a "happy" life? Then you must be like Sintsoff, "everything is unimportant," just hoping to "live," "even if it means crawling on the ground, crying and begging for another day, two days, a week" to live...

In a word, as long as you can live, there is hope; being a lackey is happiness.

Pah! Pah! This is the happiness of a lackey!

Look, this is how Marx answered his daughter's questions:

"What is your understanding of happiness?—Struggle."
"What is your understanding of unhappiness?—Surrender."
"What is the flaw you can least tolerate?—Servility."

"Our boils are their treasures." People like Simonov take the humiliation and shame that Marxist-Leninists cannot tolerate and turn it into "happiness." How filthy! How despicable! They even peddle this filthy, despicable thing as treasure, wanting the broad masses of the people to also become lackeys and traitors like them. This is even more despicable and shameless!

### 奴才的“幸福”

    奴才的“幸福”
    解放军某部五好战士　吴润生
    苏修领导集团要苏修文艺成为“为人类幸福而斗争的思想的喉舌”。
    他们所谓的“人类的幸福”是什么呢？西蒙诺夫在《生者与死者》中答道：
    “幸福”就是“面包”。哪怕是“半块砖头那么大的干透了的面包”，要是能吃到“罐头”，那就更加“幸福”了；
    “幸福”就是“时装”。床上铺“绉折没有展平的褥单”，身上穿“洁净的麻布衬衫”，而且还要有“花露水的芳香”；
    “幸福”就是女人“温柔的小手”。“希望这双手儿给他脱掉衣服，替他洗澡，把他放到床上”……
    丑死了！脏死了！这是赫鲁晓夫垃圾箱里的臭不可闻的肮脏货！赫鲁晓夫们不是早就把“共产主义”的“幸福”生活描绘成“土豆烧牛肉”的好菜和“大衣加皮鞋”的时装吗？西蒙诺夫鼓吹的“幸福”就是这一反动纲领的“解说图”。
    西蒙诺夫让小说的主人公辛佐夫参加卫国战争，经受了长期的“饥饿与寒冷”以及“许多次死亡恐惧的折磨”之后，逃回家中过到了这种“幸福”生活。
    这就是告诉大家——
    你要过“幸福”生活吗？就得象辛佐夫那样，一见敌人的汽车灯光，“连靴子也顾不及穿”，“只好把靴子连脚布拿在手里，从窗台上爬了出去”，“一口气跑了好几公里”去逃命。
    你要过“幸福”生活吗？就得象辛佐夫那样，当德国鬼子一声吼：“哈里特！”（站住）他就乖乖地“举起手来”当叛徒。
    你要过“幸福”生活吗？就得象辛佐夫那样，“一切都是不重要的”，只希望“活着”，“那怕是趴在地上，哭着乞求再有一天、两天、一周的”活命……
    一句话，能活命就有希望，当奴才就有幸福。
    呸！呸！这是奴才的幸福！
    请看，马克思是怎样回答他女儿提出的几个问题的：
    “您对幸福的理解——斗争。”
    “您对不幸的理解——屈服。”
    “您最不能容忍的缺点——奴颜婢膝。”
    “我们的痈疽，是它们的宝贝”。西蒙诺夫之流把马克思列宁主义者最不能容忍的屈辱和羞耻当成“幸福”，多么肮脏！多么下流！他们还把这种肮脏下流的东西当作宝贝到处贩卖，要广大人民也象他们那样去充当奴才和叛徒，这就更加卑鄙，更加无耻了！
