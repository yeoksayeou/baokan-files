	Be the Most Loyal Soldiers of Chairman Mao

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The seas may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our revolutionary red hearts loyal to you will never change! The sky may fall, the earth may sink, but we will forever march forward on your revolutionary line!

	Flying Squadron Deputy Commander Shen Guangshun
	Flying Squadron Commander Jiang Yinxiang

	On November 13th, the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the world, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, received us! This is a day we will never forget in our lives!

	That afternoon at four o'clock, we, the representatives of the Beijing Military Region Air Force's active learners of Chairman Mao's works, were in the middle of a group meeting when the urgent bell rang. The troops quickly assembled and rushed to the Great Hall of the People. Everyone stood in neat rows, studying Chairman Mao's quotations, singing songs in praise of Chairman Mao, eagerly awaiting the moment to see our beloved leader whom we miss day and night. The entire hall was filled with a joyful atmosphere. Time passed second by second, and every minute felt like a year. We waited and waited, and finally, the happy moment arrived! At six o'clock, our most beloved Chairman Mao walked in with sturdy steps, right into the center of the hall! The East is red, the sun rises, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world appeared before us! At that moment, our hearts were so excited that they seemed to jump out of our chests. Tears of happiness flowed uncontrollably. We shouted in unison, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years to Chairman Mao!" Chairman Mao, in his old age, was radiant with health, full of spirit, smiling, waving, and walking towards us, and took a photo with us.

	At this most precious moment, our hearts were filled with happiness and warmth. For more than a hundred years, the Chinese people lived under the oppression of capitalism, feudalism, and imperialism; who saved the Chinese people from this sea of suffering? It was our great teacher, Chairman Mao! Just as we were advancing victoriously on the bright path of socialism, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party, in their madness, attempted to drag our country back to the path of capitalist restoration, making the working people suffer twice and endure twice the hardships; at this critical moment, who personally initiated the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, steering the ship of China's revolution towards the communist course? It was our great leader, Chairman Mao! When the oppressed peoples and nations of the world were in deep water and fiery trials, who supported them in taking up arms and igniting the flames of revolution? It was our great commander, Chairman Mao! When the modern revisionists, with the Soviet revisionist leadership at their center, betrayed Marxism-Leninism, who developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, bringing the world into a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner? It was our great helmsman, Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! With your wise leadership, we will definitely defeat imperialism! We will definitely defeat modern revisionism! We will definitely defeat the reactionaries of all countries! We firmly believe that under the illumination of your brilliant thought, a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without the system of exploitation, will definitely be established! It will definitely be established!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Seeing you in such good health, we are overjoyed. From the bottom of our hearts, we wish you, Chairman Mao, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life! A thousand blessings, ten thousand blessings, may Chairman Mao's health be forever and ever, and this is our greatest happiness!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your reception of us is the greatest care, the greatest encouragement, and the greatest spur for us. We will definitely take "Fight Self and Criticize Revisionism" as the key link, actively learn and apply your works, and further carry out the revolutionization of our thoughts. We must resolutely do the following: read your books day and night, listen to your words honestly, carry out your instructions without the slightest deviation, and be the most loyal soldiers of you. We swear to you: the seas may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but our revolutionary red hearts loyal to you will never change! The sky may fall, the earth may sink, but we will forever march forward on your revolutionary line!
