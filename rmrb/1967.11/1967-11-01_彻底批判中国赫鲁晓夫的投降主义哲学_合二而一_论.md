The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to promote his capitulationist political line, seeks a reactionary philosophical viewpoint as its theoretical basis. The "unity of two into one" theory is the reactionary philosophy he uses to serve his capitulationist political line.

Everyone remembers that in 1964, on the ideological front in our country, there was a struggle to criticize Yang Xianzhen's reactionary philosophy of the "unity of two into one." Now, people have seen clearly that the basic views of Yang Xianzhen's "unity of two into one" theory all come from the Chinese Khrushchev. Originally, the mastermind of the "unity of two into one" theory in contemporary China is not Yang Xianzhen, but the Chinese Khrushchev. Yang Xianzhen is merely his henchman, his thug.

In this article, we want the reader to see how this reactionary philosophy, the "unity of two into one" theory, reflects the needs of the reactionary ruling class and serves the capitulationist line of the Chinese Khrushchev.

I

The Chinese Khrushchev's "unity of two into one" theory is thoroughly anti-Marxist-Leninist and anti-Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law exists universally in nature, human society, and human thought." This is what Chairman Mao often teaches us—the worldview of "dividing into two."

In articles such as "Why Do People Make Mistakes?", the Chinese Khrushchev propagates the "unity of two into one" theory. He opposes the view of dividing into two and especially emphasizes the following basic view: "The most fundamental nature of contradictions is the unity of contradictions," "Our policy is to utilize the unity of contradictions (not to expand their antagonistic nature)," "Two opposing things combine to form a new thing."

The relationship between the unity and struggle of contradictions is a focal point of debate between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism. Marxism-Leninism holds that opposition is absolute, while unity is relative; revisionism, on the other hand, denies the absoluteness of contradictory struggle and peddles the theory of the reconciliation of contradictions.

Lenin said: "The unity (unity, identity, oneness) of opposites is conditional, temporary, transient, relative. The struggle of mutually exclusive opposites, on the other hand, is absolute, just as development and motion are absolute."

Chairman Mao further elaborates on this issue, saying: "Because of certain conditions, the unity of contradictions is constructed, so the unity is conditional and relative." "The struggle of contradictions penetrates the entire process and causes one process to transform into another. The struggle of contradictions is ubiquitous, so the antagonistic nature of contradictions is unconditional and absolute." Chairman Mao also emphasizes: "The antagonistic nature is contained within the unity. Without the antagonistic nature, there is no unity."

Therefore, compared to unity, the struggle of contradictions is more profound and more essential. Dialectics is the philosophy of struggle. Without struggle, there is no dialectics. The basic viewpoint of Marxism is to criticize, to struggle, to make revolution. However, the Chinese Khrushchev sings a different tune, actually proposing that "the most fundamental nature of contradictions is the unity of contradictions." He blatantly denies the absoluteness of contradictory struggle, deliberately distorts dialectical materialism, and advocates the "unity of two into one" theory.

Denying the absoluteness of contradictory struggle inevitably leads to the opposite of dialectics, becoming the decayed, reactionary theory of the reconciliation of contradictions.

Dialectical materialism holds that the source of development is the internal contradictions of things. The development of internal contradictory struggle in things, through quantitative change, produces qualitative change and leaps, with new aspects of contradictions defeating old aspects, one annihilating the other. This is the process of the development of things. The Chinese Khrushchev excludes contradictory struggle, emphasizes "utilizing the unity of contradictions," and combines "opposing things." In this way, he negates the internal cause of the development of things, things cannot produce qualitative change, and there is no talk of the emergence of "new things," only the preservation of old things. His view of development is metaphysical.

The unity he talks about is also not dialectical unity. The unity of contradictions that dialectical materialism talks about refers to the mutual connection of the two sides of a contradiction under certain conditions and their mutual transformation under certain conditions; this connection and transformation are realized through struggle, not the exclusion of struggle and the mutual combination of the two sides of a contradiction into a "unity of two into one."

The process of the emergence and development of all things in the world is the process of contradictory struggle, it is dividing into two, not "unity of two into one." Since the Chinese Khrushchev advocates that the unity of contradictions is merely "two opposing things combining," his so-called "combination," "unity" excludes contradictory struggle. In this way, the two sides of a contradiction can only be mutually mixed, reconciled, and compromised. He calls this unity the "most fundamental nature of contradictions," which fully proves that the Chinese Khrushchev's "unity of two into one" theory is the theory of the reconciliation of contradictions.

The disciple of the Chinese Khrushchev, Yang Xianzhen, explains the "unity of two into one" theory as follows: "The unity of contradictions only means that the two sides of a contradiction are inseparably connected," unity refers to "common requirements," "seeking common ground while reserving differences," "things are the unity of two into one." This explanation is the true transmission of the Chinese Khrushchev.

From the viewpoint of dividing into two to examine society, one must acknowledge class contradictions and class struggle, and necessarily draw the political conclusion of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. The Chinese Khrushchev opposes dialectical materialism, denies contradictory struggle, and propagates the theory of the reconciliation of contradictions, the "unity of two into one," and necessarily denies class contradictions and class struggle, advocates class cooperation and class capitulation, and opposes the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship.

II

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Chairman Mao, based on dialectical materialism, correctly analyzed the relationship between national and class contradictions and the mutual relationships of various classes within the country, and proposed the correct theory, line, policy, and principles for the United Front against Japanese Aggression.

Chairman Mao pointed out that during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the contradiction between China and Japan had risen to the principal contradiction, while the contradictions among various classes within the country had been reduced to a subordinate position. However, class contradictions and struggles within the country still existed and had not decreased or been eliminated. The Kuomintang passively resisted Japan and actively opposed the Communists, launching wave after wave of anti-Communist campaigns and adhering to anti-Communist and anti-people policies.

In response to this situation, Chairman Mao creatively applied the law of the unity of opposites and formulated the policy and principles of the United Front against Japanese Aggression, which emphasized independence and self-reliance while also combining and struggling.

Chairman Mao said: "When the Kuomintang's anti-Communist diehards resolutely implement their policy of preventing, limiting, and opposing the Communists, and use this as preparation for surrendering to Japan, we should emphasize struggle, not unity, otherwise it would be a great mistake." "Seeking unity through struggle preserves unity, seeking unity through compromise destroys unity."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev stubbornly resisted Mao Zedong Thought. He only wanted unity and combination, not struggle. He denied that the United Front policy of the Party was a class policy of the proletariat, never mentioned class struggle within the United Front, but eagerly beautified the Kuomintang, saying nonsense such as "the Kuomintang is not a party of a single class, but an alliance of several classes," and "we cannot treat the entire Kuomintang with the attitude towards big landlords and big capitalists."

Everyone knows that since the April 12 counter-revolutionary coup in 1927, the Kuomintang had completely become a reactionary clique representing the interests of big landlords and big capitalists. It had consistently adhered to anti-Communist and anti-people policies. The Chinese Khrushchev denied class struggle within the United Front against Japanese Aggression, obscured the class nature of the Kuomintang, applied makeup to it, and beautified it into an alliance standing above class contradictions and reconciling class contradictions. This is not the peddling of the theory of the reconciliation of contradictions, the "unity of two into one," what is it?

At that time, the focus of struggle was on the issue of leadership. Would the Chinese revolution be led by the proletariat or the bourgeoisie? Would it be led by the Communist Party or the Kuomintang? Chairman Mao repeatedly emphasized: "The Chinese revolution, if it does not have the leadership of the proletariat, will necessarily not be victorious." However, the Chinese Khrushchev was so shameless as to want to eliminate the independence of the Communist Party in thought, politics, and organization, and hand over the leadership of the proletariat to the big landlords and big capitalists represented by the Kuomintang. He flatteringly praised Chiang Kai-shek as the "leader," the Kuomintang as the "flag of revolution," and the Kuomintang as "the most popular, legal organizational form of the United Front against Japanese Aggression, the best ready-made form." He also schemed to hand over the armed forces led by the Party to resist Japan, wanting the anti-Japanese guerrilla forces in North China and various regions to "merge" with the Kuomintang army, under the "direct command" of the Military Committee of the Kuomintang, "strategically implement the unified strategic intentions of the Central Military Committee," and "unite under the unified leadership of the Central Government." The so-called "unity" of the Chinese Khrushchev is unity with the Kuomintang, "unity of two into one" with the Kuomintang. He eagerly promoted this line of class capitulation, helping Chiang Kai-shek achieve the goal of "absorbing the Communists." The theory of the Chinese Khrushchev is completely a counter-revolutionary fallacy of destroying the Party and the country.

III

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries became the main enemies of the Chinese people. Before the Chinese people, there still existed the struggle between two roads and two destinies. Chairman Mao pointed out: "Is it to establish a new democratic state led by the proletariat and the masses of the people, or to establish a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big capitalists? This will be a very complex struggle." The Kuomintang, with the support of American imperialism, decided to launch a counter-revolutionary civil war, seize the fruits of the people's victory, and attempt to drag China back to the old road of semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism. In response to this situation, Chairman Mao called on the whole Party to maintain a clear mind and formulated the revolutionary policy of "opposing each other point for point, fighting for every inch of land."

However, the Chinese Khrushchev went in the opposite direction and proposed the infamous fallacy of the "new stage of peace and democracy," wanting China to take the "parliamentary road" of the bourgeoisie.

What is the so-called "basis" for the Chinese Khrushchev to propose the "new stage of peace and democracy"? He said: "Because of the support of the Soviet, British, and American governments, and the cooperation of the three major political parties (Kuomintang, Communist Party, and Democratic League) within the country, and the demands of the three major strata (laboring people, middle class, and some big capitalists)," "it is guaranteed that China will continue to move towards democratization."

The Chinese Khrushchev, in order to combine "opposing things," actually wanted to find some "common demands" between the Chinese people and American imperialism, the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the proletariat and the big capitalists, as the basis for his theory of class cooperation, the "unity of two into one," which is thoroughly counter-revolutionary sophistry.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, American imperialism wanted to support the Kuomintang and eliminate the Communist Party, which had become its established policy. The policy of American imperialism could only bring civil war to the Chinese people, leading China to the dictatorship of the big landlords and big capitalists, and was not helping China to achieve peace and democracy. The Chinese Khrushchev, adapting to the needs of American imperialist aggression, spread illusions of peace, attempting to make the Chinese people "unity of two into one" with American imperialism and turn China into a vassal of the United States. The Kuomintang, under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek, had decided on the policy of launching a counter-revolutionary civil war to exterminate the Communist Party, and was sharpening its knives, sending millions of troops to the front lines of the civil war. However, the Chinese Khrushchev still said that the Kuomintang "can continue to cooperate with our Party to build the country," and that this point "should not be doubted." Civil war was imminent, not mobilizing the people to struggle against the Kuomintang reactionaries, but wanting to "cooperate" with the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, and "unity of two into one" with the Kuomintang reactionaries, to establish a semi-colonial, semi-feudal state under the dictatorship of the big landlords and big capitalists. This is precisely the counter-revolutionary political program of the Chinese Khrushchev.

From the standpoint of class cooperation, the "unity of two into one," the Chinese Khrushchev desperately advocated the "parliamentary road," advocating the abandonment of armed struggle, and schemed to hand over the people's revolutionary armed forces.

Chairman Mao said: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." The proletariat can only smash the state machine of the bourgeoisie through violent revolution and establish proletarian dictatorship. Therefore, the Second International revisionists, such as Kautsky and Bernstein, proposed the policy of class cooperation, advocated the "parliamentary road," and opposed the violent revolution of the proletariat, which was a complete betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause. The Chinese Khrushchev actually picked up the scraps of the Second International revisionists, dreaming of the "parliamentary road," using the revolutionary army to exchange for a few official positions in the Kuomintang reactionary government, and willingly becoming an ornament and tool of the Kuomintang. He wanted everything to be "united with the Kuomintang" and "unity of two into one" with Chiang Kai-shek. This is a big political deal that the Chinese Khrushchev was preparing to strike with Chiang Kai-shek, a great capitulation to the enemy and a great betrayal of the revolution.

The "unity of two into one" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev is that this traitor wants to "unite" with American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries.

IV

After the founding of the People's Republic of China, there existed the struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, within our country. This struggle determines the two destinies and two futures of our society's development and is also a major political issue related to the world revolution.

As early as the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party in 1949, Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: After the victory of the Chinese revolution nationwide, the basic contradiction within the country is "the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie." Throughout the socialist period, the struggle between socialism and capitalism is a question of who defeats whom, of one annihilating the other. Therefore, regarding the existence and development of private capitalism in cities and the countryside, it must be restricted. "Restriction and anti-restriction" will be the main form of class struggle within our country.

The Chinese Khrushchev, however, sang a different tune, eagerly advocating the "unity of two into one" theory. He proposed: "The focus should be on uniting the bourgeoisie." He propagated the reconciliation of the contradictions between socialism and capitalism, everywhere shouting to vigorously develop urban and rural capitalist economies. He said: "The scope of activity of private enterprises is very large and can develop in parallel with state-owned enterprises." He propagated "long-term cooperation between individuals and the state, helping each other solve difficulties, mutual care, not mutual deception, but complete cooperation, mutual benefit." In order to let socialism and capitalism "cooperate," "unite," and "unity of two into one," he proposed the slogan of "consolidating the new democratic order."

After the October Socialist Revolution, Bukharin and his ilk distorted dialectics into eclecticism and the theory of equilibrium, propagating that socialism and capitalism can coexist peacefully, not collide, and develop in parallel, advocating the development of capitalism. The Chinese Khrushchev and Bukharin are birds of a feather. The Chinese Khrushchev said that according to his method, socialism and capitalism carry out long-term "peaceful economic competition," and capitalism will automatically retreat from the historical stage and "yield to socialism." This is completely the myth of the "peaceful transition to socialism" of the Second International revisionists. The Chinese Khrushchev abandoned the policy of restricting capital, advocating the so-called "consolidating the new democratic order," which in essence could only consolidate the capitalist order, only allow the great spread of capitalism, and in the end, proletarian dictatorship would be overthrown, which is precisely what the Chinese Khrushchev dreams of.

The Chinese Khrushchev advocated class reconciliation, beautifying the bourgeoisie in every way, saying they are "progressive," "glorious," with "everlasting" "historical merits," praising the so-called "exploitation is reasonable," "exploitation is meritorious," "exploitation is legal." He even shamelessly knelt down before the capitalists, begging to be exploited, saying: "Capitalist sir! I beg you to exploit me! If you exploit me, I will have food to eat, my wife and children will be able to live. If you do not exploit me, it will be terrible!" This is truly an amazing piece of writing. According to his counter-revolutionary fallacy, capitalists opening factories to exploit, workers will "have food to eat"; capitalists not exploiting, workers will "be in trouble." This is the logic of the Chinese Khrushchev! This is not clearly declaring that the interests of capital and labor are coordinated, the bourgeoisie and the proletariat are fused into one "unity of two into one"?

The old revisionist Kautsky said: "In a society, there are no two classes without common interests. Even between slave owners and slaves, there are common interests. If the owner is poor, the slave will also starve; if the slave is sick, the owner will suffer a loss." Therefore, he believed that in a capitalist society, "the more wealth there is, the easier it is to satisfy the broad demands of workers, and the most urgent need for help, the most severe poverty, can be eliminated earlier." Look, how similar the words of the Chinese Khrushchev and Kautsky are. These traitors of the proletariat, defenders of capitalism, do not say that capitalist exploitation is the root cause of workers' hunger and cold, but say that capitalist exploitation can eliminate workers' poverty; they do not expose the contradictions between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, but cover up these contradictions, advocate the coordination of class interests, and want to "unity of two into one" with the capitalists. This is thoroughly the philosophy of the exploiters.

V

After the basic victory of the socialist transformation of the means of production, in socialist society, do class and class struggle still exist? This is a key issue related to whether to consolidate and strengthen proletarian dictatorship and whether to carry the socialist revolution through to the end.

In 1957, Chairman Mao published the brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," clearly pointing out: "Class struggle has not ended. The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, the class struggle between various political forces, the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm, will still be long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense."

At this time, the Chinese Khrushchev, in response to Chairman Mao's great theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in the socialist period, shot poisoned arrows, repeatedly openly advocating "reconciliation," "compromise," "reformation," and other revisionist clichés, and shamelessly peddling the "unity of two into one" theory of the "extinction of class struggle."

The Chinese Khrushchev, ignoring the serious existence of class struggle, lied through his teeth, claiming that "we have already eliminated classes," "class struggle has passed." He said nonsense such as "the landlord class has long been eliminated," "now the domestic enemies have basically been eliminated." He denied that the contradiction between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat, capitalism and socialism is the basic contradiction of the entire transitional period, saying: "After public-private cooperation, the main contradiction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie has also been resolved," "now we should say that the main contradiction has become the contradiction within the people." What is the contradiction within the people that he talks about? He said: "Today, the main contradiction within our country is indeed the contradiction between proletarian thought and all non-proletarian thought." He thus completely transformed the struggle between two classes and two roads into the ideological contradiction within the people. This is not enough; he also wants to reconcile this contradiction and make it disappear. He said that because this contradiction "originally has unity," the policy for handling it should "emphasize unity, not antagonism." In short, enemy-people contradictions are transformed into contradictions within the people, the struggle between two classes and two roads is transformed into the ideological contradiction within the people, and the ideological contradiction within the people is "originally unified." In this way, class contradictions and class struggle are completely, thoroughly, and cleanly dissolved, various social contradictions are completely mixed into one, "unity of two into one." This is the theory of the fusion of contradictions of the Chinese Khrushchev. This is a wanton attack on Mao Zedong Thought and a thorough betrayal of proletarian dictatorship.

The Khrushchev revisionist clique in the Soviet Union betrayed Marxism-Leninism and proletarian dictatorship, and in philosophy, they also propagated the theory of the fusion of contradictions, advocating the "extinction of class struggle." They said nonsense such as in socialist society, classes and class struggle have been eliminated, "dialectical opposites, contradictions, transform into differences, differences fuse into unity." They used this reactionary philosophy to deceive the Soviet people, cover up the truth of their brutal oppression and dictatorship over the Soviet people, and conceal the fact of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union. The Chinese Khrushchev also "unity of two into one" with the Soviet revisionists. The entire purpose of their political activities is to attempt to transform proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship, transform the Communist Party into a bourgeois party, and carry out the "unity of two into one" of the "state of the whole people," the "party of the whole people," and restore capitalism.

The "unity of two into one" that the Chinese Khrushchev talks about is that this traitor wants to "unite" with imperialism, the Kuomintang reactionaries, landlords and capitalists, and Soviet revisionists. His "unity of two into one" theory is the philosophy of capitulationism, the philosophy of traitors, the philosophy of defenders of the landlord and capitalist classes, and the philosophy of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

The wheel of history cannot be stopped. Dialectical materialism is invincible. We must thoroughly criticize the "unity of two into one" theory of the Chinese Khrushchev. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the brilliant theory of Chairman Mao on dialectical materialism, and the brilliant theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society will shine even brighter, illuminate the world, and guide the surging tide of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution forward.

### 彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义哲学——“合二而一”论

    彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义哲学——“合二而一”论
    华北局红联反修战斗队
    中国赫鲁晓夫为了推行他的投降主义的政治路线，就要寻找一种反动的哲学观点作为它的理论基础。
  “合二而一”论，就是他用来为他的投降主义政治路线服务的反动哲学。
    大家还记得，一九六四年，在我国思想战线上，曾经进行过一场批判杨献珍的“合二而一”论反动哲学的斗争。现在，人们看清楚了，杨献珍“合二而一”论的基本观点，都来自中国赫鲁晓夫。原来，中国当代的“合二而一”论的祖师爷，不是杨献珍，而是中国赫鲁晓夫。杨献珍不过是他的一名走卒，一名打手。
    在这篇文章里，我们想让读者看一看，“合二而一”论这样一种反动哲学，怎样体现了反动统治阶级的需要，怎样为中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义路线服务。
                              一
  　中国赫鲁晓夫的“合二而一”论，是彻头彻尾反马克思列宁主义，反毛泽东思想的。
    毛主席教导我们说：“马克思主义的哲学认为，对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。”这就是毛主席经常教导我们的“一分为二”的世界观。
    中国赫鲁晓夫在《人为什么犯错误？》等文章中，宣扬了“合二而一”论。他和一分为二的观点针锋相对，特别强调了这样的基本观点：“矛盾的最基本的性质是矛盾的统一性”，“我们的方针是利用矛盾的统一性（不去扩大它的斗争性）”，“两个相反的东西，结合成为一个新东西”。
    矛盾的统一性和斗争性的相互关系问题，是马克思列宁主义和修正主义争论的一个焦点。马克思列宁主义认为，对立的斗争是绝对的，统一是相对的；而修正主义却竭力否认矛盾斗争的绝对性，兜售矛盾调和论。
    列宁说：“对立的统一（一致、同一、合一），是有条件的、一时的、暂存的、相对的。互相排斥的对立的斗争则是绝对的，正如发展、运动是绝对的一样。”
    毛主席进一步精辟地阐明了这个问题，他说：“由于一定的条件才构成了矛盾的同一性，所以说同一性是有条件的、相对的。”“矛盾的斗争贯串于过程的始终，并使一过程向着他过程转化，矛盾的斗争无所不在，所以说矛盾的斗争性是无条件的、绝对的。”毛主席还着重指出：“斗争性即寓于同一性之中，没有斗争性就没有同一性。”
    因此，和统一性相比较，矛盾的斗争性是更深刻、更本质的东西。辩证法就是斗争的哲学，没有斗争，就没有辩证法。马克思主义的基本观点就是要批判，要斗争，要革命。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却大唱反调，竟然提出了“矛盾的最基本的性质是矛盾的统一性”。他赤裸裸地否认矛盾斗争的绝对性，蓄意篡改唯物辩证法，提倡“合二而一”论。
    否认矛盾斗争的绝对性，必然走向辩证法的反面，成为腐朽的、反动的矛盾调和论。
    唯物辩证法认为，发展的根源是事物内部的矛盾。事物内部矛盾斗争的展开，通过量变，产生质变和飞跃，矛盾的新的方面战胜旧的方面，一个消灭一个，这就是事物的发展过程。中国赫鲁晓夫排除矛盾斗争，强调“利用矛盾统一性”，把“相反的东西结合起来”。这样，就否定了事物发展的内在原因，事物不可能产生质变，谈不上“新的东西”的出现，只能保存旧事物。他的这种发展观是形而上学的。
    他所讲的统一性，也根本不是辩证的统一性。唯物辩证法所讲的矛盾的统一性，是指矛盾的双方在一定条件下互相联系，和在一定条件下互相转化；而这种联系和转化都是依靠斗争来实现的，决不是矛盾双方排除斗争，互相结合的“合二而一”。
    世界上的一切事物发生和发展的过程，就是矛盾斗争的过程，都是一分为二，不是“合二而一”的。中国赫鲁晓夫既然主张矛盾的统一只是“两个相反的东西结合在一起”，他所谓的“结合”、“统一”排除了矛盾斗争。这样，矛盾的双方就只能是互相混合、调和、折衷。他将这种统一性说成是“矛盾的最基本的性质”，这就充分证明中国赫鲁晓夫的“合二而一”论是矛盾调和论。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的门徒杨献珍解释“合二而一”论说：“矛盾的统一，只是说矛盾双方是不可分离地联系着的意思”，统一是指“共同要求”、“求同存异”，“事物是合二而一的。”他的这番解释，是中国赫鲁晓夫的真传。
    按照一分为二的世界观考察社会，必然要承认阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，必然得出无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的政治结论。而中国赫鲁晓夫反对唯物辩证法，否认矛盾斗争，宣扬矛盾调和的“合二而一”论，就必然否认阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，提倡阶级合作、阶级投降的修正主义政治路线，反对无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政。
                           二
    在抗日战争时期，毛主席根据唯物辩证法，正确地分析了民族矛盾和阶级矛盾的关系，分析了国内各阶级的相互关系，为抗日民族统一战线提出了正确的理论、路线、方针和政策。
    毛主席指出，在抗日战争时期，中日矛盾上升为主要矛盾，国内各阶级的矛盾降到了从属的地位。但是，国内阶级间的矛盾和斗争依然存在，并没有减少或消灭。国民党消极抗日，积极反共，发动了一次又一次的反共高潮，坚持反共反人民的政策。
    针对这种情况，毛主席创造性地应用对立统一规律，制定了坚持独立自主，又联合又斗争的抗日民族统一战线的方针和政策。
    毛主席说：“在国民党反共顽固派坚决地执行其防共、限共、反共政策，并以此为投降日本的准备的时候，我们应强调斗争，不应强调统一，否则就会是绝大的错误。”“以斗争求团结则团结存，以退让求团结则团结亡”。
    但是，中国赫鲁晓夫顽固地反抗毛泽东思想，他只要统一，只要联合，不要斗争。他否认党的统一战线政策是无产阶级的阶级政策，绝口不谈统一战线内部的阶级斗争，却竭力美化国民党，胡说什么“国民党不是一个阶级的政党，而是几个阶级的联盟”，我们“不能拿对待大地主、大资产阶级的态度去对待整个国民党。”
    谁都知道，自从一九二七年四·一二反革命政变后，国民党已经完全变成了代表大地主大资产阶级利益的反动集团，它一贯坚持反共反人民的政策。中国赫鲁晓夫否认抗日民族统一战线内部的阶级斗争，抹煞国民党的阶级性，为它涂脂抹粉，把它美化成为站在各阶级矛盾之上，调和各阶级矛盾的“联盟”，这不是贩卖阶级调和的“合二而一”论又是什么呢？
    当时斗争的焦点集中在领导权问题上。中国革命由无产阶级领导呢，还是资产阶级领导？由共产党领导呢，还是国民党领导？毛主席一再强调指出：“中国革命如果没有无产阶级的领导，就必然不能胜利。”但是，中国赫鲁晓夫却丧心病狂地要从思想上、政治上和组织上取消共产党的独立性，把无产阶级的领导权拱手让给以国民党为代表的大地主大资产阶级。他肉麻地吹捧蒋介石是“领袖”，三民主义国民党是“革命的旗帜”，国民党“是抗日统一战线最通俗的、合法的组织形式，最好的现成的形式。”他还阴谋交出党所领导的抗日武装，要华北和各地区的抗日游击队和国民党军队“合并起来”，在国民党军事委员会的“直接指挥之下”，“在战略上必须实行中央军事委员会统一的战略意旨”，“团结在中央政府的统一领导之下”。中国赫鲁晓夫所谓的“统一”，就是统一于国民党，同国民党“合二而一”。他竭力推行这套阶级投降主义路线，帮助蒋介石实现“溶共”的目的。中国赫鲁晓夫这套“理论”，完全是亡党亡国的反革命谬论。
                             三　
    抗日战争胜利之后，美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派成为中国人民最主要的敌人。在中国人民面前，仍然存在着两条道路、两种命运的斗争。毛主席指出：“是建立一个无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家呢，还是建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家？这将是一场很复杂的斗争。”蒋介石国民党在美帝国主义扶植下，决心发动反革命内战，抢夺人民的胜利果实，妄图使中国回到半封建、半殖民地的老路上去。针对这种情况，毛主席号召全党要保持清醒的头脑，制订了“针锋相对，寸土必争”的革命方针。
    中国赫鲁晓夫却反其道而行之，提出了臭名昭著的“和平民主新阶段”的谬论，要中国走资产阶级的“议会道路”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫提出“和平民主新阶段”的所谓“根据”是什么呢？他说：“因有苏英美三国支援，有国内三个主要政党（国、共及民主同盟）的合作，及三个主要阶层（劳动人民、中等阶级及一部分大资产阶级分子）的要求”，“保证了中国继续走上民主化的前途”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫，为了要将“相反的东西结合在一起”，居然要在中国人民和美帝国主义之间，共产党和国民党之间，无产阶级和大资产阶级之间，找出什么“共同要求”是“和平民主”，作为他的阶级合作的“合二而一”论的根据，真是彻头彻尾的反革命诡辩。
    抗日战争胜利后，美帝国主义要扶植国民党，消灭共产党，已成了它的既定国策。美帝国主义的这种政策只能给中国人民带来内战，是把中国引向大地主大资产阶级专政，决不是什么帮助中国实现和平民主。中国赫鲁晓夫适应美帝侵略政策的需要，散布和平幻想，妄图使中国人民和美帝“合二而一”，把中国变为美国的附庸。蒋介石国民党发动反革命内战，扑灭共产党的方针已经定了，而且磨刀霍霍，把几百万军队运往内战前线。但是，中国赫鲁晓夫还说什么蒋介石国民党“能继续与我党合作建国”，对这一点，不能“采取怀疑态度”。内战迫在眉睫，不发动人民去和国民党反动派作斗争，却要和人民公敌蒋介石“合作”，和国民党反动派“合二而一”，建立一个大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家，这正是中国赫鲁晓夫的反革命政治纲领。
    中国赫鲁晓夫从这种阶级合作的“合二而一”论出发，拚命鼓吹“议会道路”，主张放弃武装斗争，阴谋交出人民的革命武装。
    毛主席说：“枪杆子里面出政权”。无产阶级只有通过暴力革命，才能粉碎资产阶级的国家机器，建立无产阶级专政。因此，第二国际修正主义者考茨基、伯恩施坦之流提出阶级合作的政策，鼓吹“议会道路”，反对无产阶级暴力革命，就是对无产阶级革命事业的彻底背叛。中国赫鲁晓夫竟然拾起第二国际修正主义的破烂，作“议会道路”的清梦，用革命军队去换取国民党反动政府的一官半职，甘当国民党的装饰品和工具。他要一切“统一于国民党”，和蒋介石“合二而一”。这是中国赫鲁晓夫准备和蒋介石拍板成交的一桩大政治买卖，是对敌人的大投降，对革命的大叛卖。
    中国赫鲁晓夫的“合二而一”论，就是他这个叛徒，要“合”到美帝国主义和蒋介石反动派那里去。

    中华人民共和国成立以后，在我国存在着无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。这个斗争决定我国社会发展的两种命运、两种前途，也是关系到世界革命的重大政治问题。
    早在一九四九年党的七届二中全会上，毛主席就明确地指出：中国革命在全国胜利以后，国内的基本矛盾是“工人阶级和资产阶级的矛盾”。在整个社会主义时期，社会主义和资本主义的矛盾斗争，是谁战胜谁的问题，是一个消灭另一个的问题。因此，对于城乡私人资本主义的存在和发展，必须加以限制。“限制和反限制”，将是我们国家内部的“阶级斗争的主要形式”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫又大唱反调，竭力鼓吹“合二而一”论。他提出：对于资产阶级“重点放在联合上”。他宣扬调和社会主义和资本主义的矛盾，到处叫嚷要大力发展城乡资本主义经济。他说：“私营企业的活动范围很大，可以和国营企业平行发展。”他宣扬“私人和公家的长期合作，你有困难我帮助解决，我有困难你帮助解决，互相照顾，不是尔虞我诈，而是完全合作，彼此有益。”为了要让社会主义和资本主义这样“合作”、“统一”，“合二而一”下去，他提出了“巩固新民主主义秩序”的口号。
    十月社会主义革命以后，布哈林之流把辩证法歪曲为折衷主义和均衡论，宣扬社会主义和资本主义可以和平共处，互不相撞，平行发展，鼓吹发展资本主义。中国赫鲁晓夫和布哈林完全是一丘之貉。中国赫鲁晓夫说，按他的办法搞下去，社会主义和资本主义实行长期“和平的经济竞争”，资本主义就会自动退出历史舞台，“让位于社会主义”。这完全是第二国际修正主义者的“和平长入社会主义”的神话。中国赫鲁晓夫抛弃限制资本的政策，宣扬所谓“巩固新民主主义秩序”，实质上就只能是巩固资本主义秩序，就只能是资本主义的大泛滥，最后，无产阶级专政就会被颠覆，这正是中国赫鲁晓夫所梦寐以求的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹阶级调和，百般美化资产阶级，说他们“进步”、“光荣”，有“永垂不朽”的“历史功劳”，颂扬所谓“剥削有理”、“剥削有功”、“剥削合法”。他还无耻之极地跪倒在资本家的脚下，请求剥削，说：“资本家先生！我请求你剥削一下吧！剥削我就有饭吃，老婆孩子就能活下去，如果不剥削，就不得了”！这真是绝妙奇文。按照他的反革命谬论，资本家开工厂剥削，工人才“有饭吃”；资本家不剥削，工人就“不得了”。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的混账逻辑！这不是明明白白地宣称，资本的利益和劳动的利益协调一致，资产阶级和无产阶级融合一体“合二而一”吗？
    老修正主义者考茨基说：“一个社会里没有两个毫无共同利益的阶级。甚至奴隶主和奴隶之间也有共同利益。主人穷了，奴隶也就要挨饿，奴隶病了，主人就要受损失。”因此，他认为资本主义社会“财富越多，工人的广泛要求就越容易满足，最急切地需要帮助的那种最严重的贫困就能够越早消灭。”看，中国赫鲁晓夫说的和考茨基说的多么相似。他们这些无产阶级的叛徒，资本主义的辩护士，不说资本剥削是造成工人阶级挨饿受冻的根源，却说资本剥削可以免除工人的贫困；不去揭露资产阶级和无产阶级之间的矛盾，却掩饰这种矛盾，宣扬阶级利益的协调一致，他们要去和资本家“合二而一”。这就是彻头彻尾的剥削者的哲学。
                             五
    在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造取得基本胜利以后，在社会主义社会里，是否还存在着阶级和阶级斗争？这是关系到是否要巩固和加强无产阶级专政，是否要把社会主义革命进行到底的关键问题。
    一九五七年，毛主席发表了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，明确指出：“阶级斗争并没有结束。无产阶级和资产阶级之间的阶级斗争，各派政治力量之间的阶级斗争，无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”
    就在这个时候，中国赫鲁晓夫又针对毛主席关于社会主义时期的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的伟大理论，射出了一支支的毒箭，一再公开鼓吹“调和”、“妥协”、“改良”等等修正主义的陈词滥调，大肆贩卖“合二而一”的“阶级斗争熄灭论”。
    中国赫鲁晓夫不顾阶级斗争严重存在的事实，瞪着眼说瞎话，宣称“我们已经消灭了阶级”，“阶级斗争已经过去了”。说什么“地主阶级早已消灭了”，“现在国内敌人已经基本上被消灭”。他否认资产阶级和无产阶级、资本主义和社会主义的斗争是整个过渡时期的基本矛盾，他说：“公私合营以后，无产阶级与资产阶级的主要矛盾也解决了”，“现在应该讲人民内部的矛盾已成为主要矛盾。”他所说的人民内部矛盾又是什么呢？他说：“今天我们国内的主要矛盾的确是无产阶级思想与一切非无产阶级思想的矛盾。”他就是这样把两个阶级和两条道路的斗争，完全化为人民内部的思想上的矛盾。这还不够，他对这种矛盾还要加以调和，使之化为乌有。他说，因为这种矛盾“原来是有同一性的”，所以，处理的方针要“强调同一性，而不是强调斗争性”。总之，敌我矛盾化为人民内部矛盾，两个阶级和两条道路的斗争化为人民内部的思想矛盾，人民内部的思想矛盾又“原来是有同一性的”。这样，阶级矛盾和阶级斗争全部、干净、彻底地化掉了，各种社会矛盾完全混而为一，“合二而一”。这就是中国赫鲁晓夫的矛盾融合论。这是对毛泽东思想的猖狂进攻，对无产阶级专政的彻底背叛。
    苏联的赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团背叛马克思列宁主义，背叛无产阶级专政，在哲学上也是宣扬矛盾融合论，鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”。他们胡说，在社会主义社会，消灭了阶级和阶级斗争，“辩证的对立面、矛盾，转变为差别，差别融合为统一”。他们就是利用这种反动哲学来欺骗苏联人民，掩饰他们向苏联人民进行残酷的压迫和专政的真相，掩盖资本主义在苏联复辟的事实。中国赫鲁晓夫又和苏联修正主义者们“合二而一”了。他们全部政治活动的目的，就是妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，变共产党为资产阶级政党，搞“合二而一”的“全民国家”、“全民党”，复辟资本主义。
    中国赫鲁晓夫所讲的“合二而一”，就是他这个叛徒，要去和帝国主义、蒋介石反动派、地主和资本家、苏联修正主义等等“合”在一起。他的“合二而一”论，是投降主义的哲学，是叛徒的哲学，是地主资产阶级的辩护士的哲学，是反革命修正主义的哲学。
    历史前进的车轮不可阻挡。唯物辩证法是不可战胜的。我们必须彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的“合二而一”论。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，伟大领袖毛主席关于唯物辩证法的天才学说，关于社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的光辉理论，必将进一步大放异彩，普照全球，指引中国革命和世界革命的洪流滚滚前进。
