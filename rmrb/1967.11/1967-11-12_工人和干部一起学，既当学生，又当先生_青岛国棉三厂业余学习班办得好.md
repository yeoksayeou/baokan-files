Workers and cadres study together, acting as both students and teachers. The evening study classes at Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 3 are successful.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Jinan on the 11th, the proletarian revolutionary faction of Qingdao Cotton Mill No. 3, with the help of the stationed People's Liberation Army, has established evening study classes for Mao Zedong Thought in each workshop, achieving immediate and remarkable results.

The guiding principle of the evening study classes for Mao Zedong Thought in this mill is: to take "fighting selfishness and criticizing revisionism" as the key, to use the "Old Five Articles" as the basic learning content, to take the heroic and model figures of the People's Liberation Army as examples, to emphasize self-education, to widely carry out heart-to-heart talks, and to achieve the goal of breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, realizing the thought revolution, and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Their learning methods are: first, learn; learn Chairman Mao's latest instructions and the "Old Five Articles"; second, expose; expose the manifestations and harms of selfishness; third, fight; use Mao Zedong Thought to fight selfishness and criticize revisionism; fourth, change; do as Chairman Mao says. Each session of the study class lasts six days, with one and a half hours of evening study each day, divided into classes according to the workshop shifts, allowing all revolutionary workers to participate.

Since October, the revolutionary committees of various workshops in this mill have held one to two sessions of evening study classes for Mao Zedong Thought, with over three hundred people participating in the studies. Since those participating in the evening study classes are all from the same workshop or work team, they know each other well and have close relationships. Therefore, everyone can exchange opinions sincerely during the study. For example, two old workers in the weaving workshop had different views in the past, had disagreements, and even did not speak to each other. After participating in the study class this time, the two studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions and works, had heart-to-heart talks, eliminated misunderstandings, unified their thoughts, and became harmonious.

The evening study classes do not have special teachers; they completely rely on the masses to educate themselves and liberate themselves. Workers and cadres study together, everyone acts as both a student and a teacher, learning from each other, helping each other, and improving together. Everyone, according to different objects, targets active thoughts, learns a segment of Chairman Mao's teachings, compares with an example of a PLA hero, and raises their ideological awareness.

The evening study classes use Mao Zedong Thought to promote the thought revolution of people, which in turn promotes production. In October, the total output value of the entire mill exceeded the planned target, and the product quality remained stable and improved.

### 工人和干部一起学，既当学生，又当先生  青岛国棉三厂业余学习班办得好

    工人和干部一起学，既当学生，又当先生
    青岛国棉三厂业余学习班办得好
    据新华社济南十一日电　青岛国棉三厂无产阶级革命派在驻厂解放军的帮助下，各车间大办毛泽东思想业余学习班，收到了立竿见影的显著效果。
    这个厂的毛泽东思想业余学习班的办学方针是：以“斗私，批修”为纲，以“老五篇”为基本学习内容，以人民解放军英雄模范人物为榜样，以自我教育为主，广泛开展谈心活动，以达到破私立公，实现思想革命化，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的目的。
    他们的学习方法是：一学：学习毛主席的最新指示和“老五篇”；二摆：摆“私”字的表现和危害；三斗：用毛泽东思想斗私批修；四改：毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。学习班每期办六天，每天业余学习一个半小时，按各车间的班次分班，革命职工人人可以参加。
    十月份以来，这个厂的各车间革命委员会已先后办了一到两期毛泽东思想业余学习班，参加学习的有三百多人。由于参加业余学习班的都是本车间或一个班组的同志，大家平时互相了解，关系密切。因此，大家在学习中能推心置腹地交换意见。如织布车间的两位老工人，过去因为观点不一致互相有意见，甚至互不说话。这次参加学习班后，两人学习了毛主席的最新指示和著作，谈了心，消除了隔阂，统一了思想，感情融洽了。
    业余学习班没有专门教员，完全靠群众自己教育自己，自己解放自己。工人、干部一起学，大家既当学生，又当先生，互相学习，互相帮助，取长补短，共同提高。大家根据不同对象，针对活思想，学一段毛主席的教导，对照一个解放军英雄的榜样，提高自己的思想觉悟。
    业余学习班用毛泽东思想促进了人的思想革命化，带动了生产。十月份，全厂总产值计划超额完成，产品质量稳定提高。
