The total evaluation work for the Four-Good Units of the People's Liberation Army is about to be fully launched. Many military leadership bodies, using Chairman Mao Zedong's latest instructions as a guide and "Criticizing the Self and Opposing Revisionism" as the main theme, have conducted pilot evaluations in units carrying out various tasks.

During the pilot evaluations, many units have achieved successes and gained experiences. These experiences are as follows:

1. Starting with ideological education, deeply understanding the great significance of the total evaluation. This year's total evaluation is being conducted under the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Various units, in their pilot evaluations, have addressed the living thoughts of the cadres and soldiers, emphasizing the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, the great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the new achievements made by the army in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, national defense, and carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militant" tasks and other missions over the past year. After receiving ideological education, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers have deeply realized that this year is the year when Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought have been further implemented in the units, the year when studying and applying Chairman Mao's works has achieved great results and accumulated rich experiences. Many comrades excitedly said, "This year, we have directly participated in the local cultural revolution and thrown ourselves into the great waves of class struggle, which is like an ungraded political course and an unexamined exam. Studying Chairman Mao's works is the most vivid, touching the soul the deepest, and the effect of action is the most obvious." They pointed out that Chairman Mao's extremely important instructions during his inspection of North China, Central South, and East China have further indicated the direction for the entire Party, the entire nation, and the entire army to advance courageously. Doing a good job in this year's total evaluation is of great significance in firmly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and advancing the revolutionary and combat-ready construction of the army, achieving new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

2. Using "Criticizing the Self and Opposing Revisionism" as the main theme, raising the self-awareness of cadres and soldiers to revolutionize their souls. Various units, during the pilot evaluations, have universally organized the troops to study Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the "May 7th Directive," the "Three Old Articles," and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party"; studied Vice Chairman Lin's important speech on this year's National Day, the instructions on raising the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level, and the resolutions of the enlarged meeting of the Military Commission, enhancing the understanding of criticizing the self and opposing revisionism, and strengthening the self-awareness of criticizing the self and opposing revisionism. Some units have guided the masses to connect with practical struggles, from the fundamental issues of anti-revisionism and preventing revisionism, cultivating successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, recognizing the great significance of criticizing the self and opposing revisionism, and mobilizing cadres and soldiers to discuss the gains, experiences, and feelings of criticizing the self and opposing revisionism.

3. Using the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines as the main content, summarizing new experiences of criticizing the self and opposing revisionism. Various units, in their summaries, have mainly focused on the following issues: In the sharp and complex class struggle, whether one is unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; in carrying out the "Three Supports, Two Militant" tasks, whether one can correctly handle the revolutionary leftists and the mass movement, and whether one can quickly correct mistakes; in the great waves of class struggle, whether one dares to thoroughly break down the "self" and establish the "public," and thoroughly transform one's worldview; in various tasks and daily life, whether one handles the relationships between superiors and subordinates, officers and soldiers, and the military and the people according to Chairman Mao's teachings on "resolving the problem of relationships between superiors and subordinates, and handling the relationships between cadres and the masses." In the inspection and summary, one should find problems in the line struggle, find the root cause in the soul, find the answer in Chairman Mao's works, and see the effect in actual actions.

4. With self-education as the main focus, mobilizing the masses to educate themselves. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a certain sense, the most intelligent and talented are those with the most practical experience." Various units, in their inspections and summaries, have fully carried out democratic practices, mobilizing the masses to discuss progress and experiences. Cadres should be the students of the masses, humbly listening to the masses' opinions, correctly handling the masses' criticisms, and bravely conducting self-criticism. Soldiers should correctly handle the cadres. They should carry forward the glorious tradition of respecting and loving the cadres, and carry forward the excellent style of unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness. They should vigorously commend those who are unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao, unconditionally loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and unconditionally loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and strive to create more advanced individuals and collectives armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

5. Strengthening leadership, making the process of the total evaluation a process of deeply studying and firmly implementing Chairman Mao's latest instructions. In the pilot units, many leadership bodies have organized forces to go deep into the units, timely gaining experiences, promoting the overall situation, making the process of the total evaluation a process of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and striving hard in action.

Currently, the units that have already conducted the total evaluation have higher enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, a stronger atmosphere of emphasizing proletarian politics, closer relationships between superiors and subordinates, officers and soldiers, and the military and the people. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers are determined to raise the standard of the Four-Good Units to a new level, push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, better complete the "Three Supports, Two Militant" and other tasks, and achieve new merits in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    把四好连队水平提到一个新高度
    解放军以“斗私，批修”为纲搞四好总评试点工作取得经验
    一、从形势教育入手，深刻认识四好总评的重大意义；二、以“斗私，批修”为纲，提高干部战士在灵魂深处爆发革命的自觉性；三、以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为主要内容，总结斗私批修的新经验；四、以自我教育为主，发动群众自己教育自己；五、加强领导，使四好总评的过程成为深入学习、坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示的过程。
    新华社二十九日讯  中国人民解放军陆海空三军四好连队的总评工作，即将全面展开。许多部队领导机关，以伟大领袖毛主席的最新指示为指针，以“斗私，批修”为纲，分别在执行各种不同任务的连队，进行了四好总评的试点工作。
    在试点中，许多部队取得了成绩，获得了经验。这些经验是：
    一、从形势教育入手，深刻认识四好总评的重大意义。今年的四好总评是在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下进行的，各单位在试点中，针对指战员们的活思想，大讲特讲无产阶级文化大革命的空前大好形势，大讲特讲毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，大讲特讲毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大胜利，大讲特讲部队一年来在保卫无产阶级文化大革命、保卫国防、执行“三支”“两军”任务和其他任务中取得的新成就。广大指战员经过形势教育，深刻体会到：今年是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和建军思想在连队进一步落实的一年，是活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，改造世界观，取得巨大成效和丰富经验的一年。许多同志激动地说：“今年直接参加地方文化大革命，投身到阶级斗争的大风大浪中，等于不上课的政治课，不经考试的考试，学习毛主席著作最生动，触及灵魂最深刻，行动效果最明显。”他们指出，毛主席视察华北、中南和华东地区时所作的极为重要的指示，进一步给全党、全国、全军指出了奋勇前进的方向。搞好今年的四好总评，对于坚决贯彻执行毛主席的最新指示，进一步推动活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进部队革命化战斗化建设，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功，具有极其重大的意义。
    二、以“斗私，批修”为纲，提高干部战士在灵魂深处爆发革命的自觉性。各单位在试点中，普遍组织部队学习毛主席的最新指示、“五·七”指示、“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》；学习林副主席在今年国庆节的重要讲话、关于把学习毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段的指示，以及军委扩大会议决议，提高对斗私批修的认识，增强斗私批修的自觉性。有些单位引导群众联系斗争实践，从反修防修、培养无产阶级革命事业接班人等根本问题上，认识斗私批修的重大意义，发动干部战士畅谈斗私批修的收获、体会和经验。
    三、以两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争为主要内容，总结斗私批修的新经验。各单位在总结中主要抓住了以下几个问题：在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，是否无限忠于毛主席、忠于毛泽东思想、忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；在“三支”“两军”任务中，是否能正确地对待革命左派和群众运动，有了错误是否能迅速改正；在阶级斗争的大风大浪中活学活用毛主席著作，是否敢于大破“私”字，大立“公”字，彻底改造世界观；在各项工作和日常生活中，是否按照毛主席“要很好地解决上下级关系问题，搞好干部和群众的关系”的教导，正确地处理上下级之间、官兵之间、军民之间的关系。在检查总结中，要在路线斗争上找问题，在灵魂深处找原因，在毛主席著作中找答案，在实际行动上看效果。
    四、以自我教育为主，发动群众自己教育自己。毛主席教导我们：“在某种意义上来说，最聪明、最有才能的，是最有实践经验的战士。”各单位在检查总结中，充分发扬民主，发动群众谈进步、谈体会。干部要做群众的小学生，虚心听取群众的意见，正确对待群众的批评，勇于进行自我批评。战士要正确对待干部。发扬尊干爱兵的光荣传统，发扬团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的优良作风。大力表扬无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的典型，为创造更多的用毛泽东思想武装起来的先进人物和先进集体而奋斗。
    五、加强领导，使四好总评的过程成为深入学习、坚决贯彻毛主席最新指示的过程。在试点单位中，许多领导机关都组织力量深入连队，及时取得经验，推动全盘，使四好总评的过程成为活学活用毛主席著作，在用字上狠下功夫的大动员、大检查、大总结、大落实的过程。
    目前，已经进行了四好总评的单位，活学活用毛主席著作的热情更高，突出无产阶级政治的空气更浓，上下级关系、官兵关系和军民关系更密切。广大指战员决心把四好连队的水平提到一个新高度，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向一个新阶段，更好地完成“三支”“两军”和其他各项任务，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中立新功。
