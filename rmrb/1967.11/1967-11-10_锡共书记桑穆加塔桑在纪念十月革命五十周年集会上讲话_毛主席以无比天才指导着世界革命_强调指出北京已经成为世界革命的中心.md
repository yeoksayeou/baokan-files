The Sri Lankan Communist Party held a mass rally in Colombo on November 7 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and strongly condemned the betrayal of the October Revolution by the Soviet revisionist leadership.

Sanmugathasan, a member of the Central Political Bureau and the Central Secretariat of the Sri Lankan Communist Party, delivered a speech titled "The Experience and Lessons of the October Revolution and the Betrayal by the Soviet Revisionists." He said that the greatest experience and lesson of the October Revolution for the Sri Lankan revolution and progressive movement is: the exploiting classes will never voluntarily leave the historical stage. Only through revolution can the exploitation of landlords and capitalists be abolished.

He said that for the proletarian revolution to succeed, it must have the leadership of a party like the Bolshevik Party founded by Lenin. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, such a party should be a disciplined party armed with Marxism-Leninism, practicing self-criticism, and closely linked with the masses. Without such a party, the revolution cannot succeed.

Sanmugathasan spoke about how, after modern revisionists seized power in the homeland of the October Revolution, they implemented a series of measures to fully restore capitalism domestically. He said that this is a painful lesson for all Marxist-Leninists and genuine revolutionaries. Sanmugathasan then pointed out that in international affairs, the Soviet revisionists are hastening to collude with U.S. imperialism. On the Vietnam issue, the Soviet revisionists are serving U.S. imperialism, acting as the fire brigade to extinguish the people's war ignited by the heroic Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression. In the Middle East, when the Arab people were subjected to armed aggression supported by the United States and Israel, the Soviet revisionists betrayed the Arab people.

Sanmugathasan emphasized that now, the center of world revolution has shifted to Beijing, the capital of China. Comrade Mao Zedong resides there and guides the world revolution with unparalleled genius. Sanmugathasan concluded by saying that the only way to commemorate the great October Revolution is to resolutely advance along the revolutionary path of the October Revolution.

Sri Lankan Freedom Party MP S. D. Bandaranaike also spoke at the meeting. He pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has become a tool of U.S. imperialism, betraying the national liberation cause of the oppressed peoples of the world. Bandaranaike enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said that the Communist Party of China, led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, is at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and in support of the national liberation struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world, advancing bravely.

    锡共书记桑穆加塔桑在纪念十月革命五十周年集会上讲话
    毛主席以无比天才指导着世界革命

    新华社科伦坡九日电　锡兰共产党七日在这里举行群众集会，纪念十月社会主义革命五十周年，强烈谴责苏修领导集团对十月革命的背叛。
    锡兰共产党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记桑穆加塔桑在会上作了题为《十月革命的经验教训和苏修的背叛》的讲话。他说，十月革命对锡兰革命和进步运动的最大的经验教训是：剥削阶级决不会自动退出历史舞台，只有通过革命，才能废除地主和资本家的剥削。
    他说，无产阶级革命要取得成功，必须要有象列宁所缔造的那样的布尔什维克党的领导。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，这样的党应该是一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。没有这样的党，革命是不能成功的。
    桑穆加塔桑谈到在十月革命的故乡现代修正主义者篡夺了政权后，在国内采取一系列措施，全面地实行资本主义复辟。他说，对于一切马克思列宁主义者和真正的革命者来说，这是沉痛的教训。桑穆加塔桑接着指出，在国际事务中，苏修正在加紧同美帝国主义相勾结。在越南问题上，苏修为美帝国主义效劳，充当了扑灭英雄的越南人民为反对美国侵略而燃起的人民战争烈火的消防队。在中东，当阿拉伯人民遭到美国支持的以色列武装侵略的时候，苏修出卖了阿拉伯人民。
    桑穆加塔桑强调说，现在，世界革命的中心已经转移到中国首都北京，毛泽东同志居住在那里，他以无比的天才指导着世界革命。桑穆加塔桑最后说，纪念伟大的十月革命的唯一办法是决心沿着十月革命的革命步伐前进。
    锡兰自由党议员塞·迪·班达拉奈克也在会上讲了话。他指出，苏修领导集团已经成了美帝国主义的工具，这个集团背叛了世界被压迫人民的民族解放事业。班达拉奈克热烈赞扬了中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，以伟大领袖毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党站在反对帝国主义、支援世界被压迫人民争取民族解放斗争的最前线，奋勇前进。
