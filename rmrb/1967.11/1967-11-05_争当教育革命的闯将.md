On the evening of November 2, the radio broadcast the latest instructions from our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao on the educational revolution. The revolutionary teachers and students of our institute immediately erupted in joy, rushing to tell each other the news. This is Chairman Mao's greatest trust, encouragement, and exhortation to us, the revolutionary faction of the proletariat!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To ensure that our party and state do not change color, we not only need a correct line and policy, but also need to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause." "This is an extremely important matter concerning the life and death of our party and state. This is a long-term plan for the proletarian revolutionary cause for a hundred years, a thousand years, and ten thousand years." Primary and secondary schools are important battlegrounds for cultivating and educating young people to become reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. On this battleground, there has always been an extremely fierce and sharp class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie over the next generation. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road have, for more than a decade, stubbornly pushed a revisionist educational line in primary and secondary schools, viciously resisting and opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

The former Beijing Teachers' Training Institute was a tool used by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique to push the revisionist educational line in Beijing's primary and secondary schools. It was an institution set up by the former Beijing Municipal Committee to imitate the Soviet revisionists' teacher training system. In the past, the former Municipal Committee and a handful of power-holders within the institute who were taking the capitalist road, did everything they could to block the voice of our great leader Chairman Mao, and obstructed the spread of Chairman Mao's brilliant educational thoughts among revolutionary teachers and students. They faithfully executed the revisionist educational line of China's Khrushchev. Every year, through compiling teaching reference materials, conducting teacher training classes, and holding lectures, they spread the poison of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism, corrupting the revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools, and leading them astray from proletarian politics and the three great revolutionary movements. They also, through the annual entrance examination question-setting work, deliberately set difficult and biased questions to make things hard for the children of workers and peasants, depriving workers and peasants of their right to education, and implementing bourgeois dictatorship over the laboring people, maintaining the rule of the bourgeois intellectuals over the schools. This is intolerable! These crimes must be settled!

Currently, the revolutionary teachers and students of primary and secondary schools are enthusiastically responding to the great call of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and are gradually starting to resume classes and make revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction of our institute recently carried out a rectification campaign with the focus on "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness," overcoming various selfish thoughts, with everyone's morale high and confidence boosted, determined to throw themselves into the fiery educational revolution, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers, and from revolutionary teachers and students, teaching and making revolution together. After hearing Chairman Mao's latest instructions, the revolutionary committee of our institute immediately studied the specific battle deployment, deciding to organize a part of the people to go to the front line of primary and secondary schools, participate in the resumption of classes and make revolution, and cooperate with relevant units to start compiling new textbooks for primary and secondary schools; another part of the people will start the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our institute. We must take Chairman Mao's brilliant educational thoughts as our guide, and Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the line, and be brave pioneers in the great practice of the educational revolution!

    争当教育革命的闯将
    北京教师进修学院革命委员会
    十一月二日晚上，广播里传来了我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，我院革命师生立刻一片欢腾，纷纷奔走相告。这是毛主席对我们无产阶级革命派最大的信任，最大的鼓舞，最大的鞭策！
    毛主席教导我们说：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”“这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。这是无产阶级革命事业的百年大计，千年大计，万年大计。”中小学校是培养教育青少年成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人的重要阵地。在这块阵地上，始终存在着无产阶级同资产阶级争夺下一代的极其激烈尖锐的阶级斗争。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了实现复辟资本主义的阴谋，十多年来，在中小学顽固地推行一条修正主义教育路线，恶毒地抵制和反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。
    前北京教师进修学院，是彭真反革命修正主义集团在北京市中小学推行修正主义教育路线的工具，是旧北京市委仿照苏修的教师进修制度搞起来的一个机构。过去，旧市委和我院党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，极力封锁我们伟大领袖毛主席的声音，百般阻挠毛主席光辉的教育思想在革命师生中传播，忠实地执行中国赫鲁晓夫的修正主义教育路线。他们每年通过编教学参考资料、办教师进修班、办讲座等方式，极力散布封建主义、资本主义、修正主义毒素，毒害中小学的革命师生，把师生引到脱离无产阶级政治，脱离三大革命运动的邪路上去。他们还通过一年一度的招生考试命题工作，故意出难题、偏题，刁难工农子女，剥夺工农受教育的权利，对劳动人民实行资产阶级专政，维护资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。是可忍，孰不可忍！这些罪行，我们必须一一清算！
    目前，中小学的革命师生热烈响应毛主席和党中央的伟大号召，陆续开始复课闹革命。我院的无产阶级革命派，最近以“斗私，批修”为纲进行整风，克服了种种私心杂念，人人斗志昂扬，信心百倍，决心投入火热的教育革命运动中去，向工农兵学习，向革命师生学习，同他们一起边教学，边革命。听到毛主席的最新指示以后，我院革命委员会立即研究了具体的作战部署，决定组织一部分人开往中小学第一线，参加复课闹革命，并和有关单位合作着手编写中小学的新教材；另一部分人开始搞本院的斗批改。我们一定要以毛主席的光辉的教育思想为指南，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为纲，在教育革命的伟大实践中作勇敢的闯将！
