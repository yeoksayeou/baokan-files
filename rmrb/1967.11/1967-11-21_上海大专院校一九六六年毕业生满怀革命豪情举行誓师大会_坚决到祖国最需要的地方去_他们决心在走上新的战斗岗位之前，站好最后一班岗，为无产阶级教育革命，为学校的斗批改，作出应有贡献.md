In the great situation of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, the graduates of Shanghai's colleges and universities in 1966 are about to take up new positions in revolution and construction. On the 18th, the graduates, with excited hearts, held a rally to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely going to where the motherland needs them most. They expressed at the meeting: They will always remember Chairman Mao's teachings of "The more difficult the place, the more we should go there, this is what a good comrade should do," and prepare for everything, go to the interior, go to the border, go to where the motherland needs most, where the work is most arduous, go to the frontline of the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, roll in the mud, splash with oil, and forge a body of steel.

Shanghai has done a lot of work on the allocation of this year's graduates. Many schools, under the leadership of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee's Graduate Work Committee, have established graduate allocation groups with Red Guards participating. Most schools have, with "Fight Self and Criticize Revisionism" as the guideline, held Mao Zedong Thought study classes, thoroughly criticizing and eliminating the bourgeois reactionary line and its poison that the clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as the head, had pushed in the graduate allocation work. The broad graduates have put studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, prior to everything, and heavier than everything, and have thoroughly broken down the "self" and established the "public," viewing this graduate allocation as a new "examination." Many revolutionary young people excitedly said: "This graduate allocation is a touchstone for us to test whether we are truly revolutionary or just revolutionary in words." "We must thoroughly eliminate bourgeois individualism, and go where the Party points!"

At the rally on the 18th, graduates from Jiao Tong University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, Fudan University, Shanghai First Medical College, Shanghai Drama Academy, Shanghai Institute of Finance and Economics, East China Textile Institute, Shanghai Institute of Foreign Trade, and East China Institute of Chemical Technology handed in their resolutions to the meeting, expressing their determination to follow the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on intellectuals' integration with the workers and peasants, and to join the new battle ranks, learn from the working class, poor and lower-middle peasants, and the People's Liberation Army, and write a magnificent poem of proletarian revolution and socialist construction with their burning youth, to create new merits and new labor for the people. They also expressed that, on the eve of embarking on a new revolutionary journey, they will resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's latest instructions on educational revolution, stand the last watch, and make due contributions to the proletarian educational revolution and the school's struggle, criticism, and reform.

Graduates Gao Junpeng from Shanghai First Medical College and Liu Dongmin from East China Normal University also reported at the meeting their process of resolving to settle down in the countryside and the border, which was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee and representatives of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters expressed warm congratulations to the graduates at the meeting. Leaders of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee encouraged the graduates to, after arriving at their new battle stations, persist in reading Chairman Mao's books seriously for life, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, being good soldiers of Chairman Mao, persisting in revolution to the end, and being steadfast and thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

    坚决到祖国最需要的地方去
    他们决心在走上新的战斗岗位之前，站好最后一班岗，为无产阶级教育革命，为学校的斗批改，作出应有贡献
    新华社上海二十日电　在无产阶级文化大革命大好形势下，上海市大专院校一九六六年毕业生，即将陆续走上新的革命和建设岗位。十八日，毕业生们怀着激动的心情，举行了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决到祖国最需要的地方去的誓师大会。他们在会上表示：永远牢记毛主席“越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志”的教导，作好一切准备，到内地去，到边疆去，到祖国最需要、工作最艰苦的地方去，到阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动的火线上去，滚一身泥巴，溅一身油污，炼出一身钢筋铁骨。
    上海对这一届大专院校毕业生分配做了不少工作。许多院校在上海市革命委员会毕业生工作委员会领导下，建立了有红卫兵小将参加的毕业生分配小组。大多数学校都以“斗私，批修”为纲，举办了毛泽东思想学习班，彻底批判和清除以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派过去在毕业生分配工作中所推行的资产阶级反动路线及其流毒。广大毕业生都把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，大学大用“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，把这次毕业生分配看作是一场新的“考试”。许多革命小将激动地说：“这次毕业生分配，对我们来说，是考验真正革命还是口头革命的试金石。”“我们要彻底破除资产阶级个人主义思想，党指向那里，就奔向那里！”
    在十八日的大会上，交通大学、同济大学、华东师范大学、复旦大学、上海第一医学院、上海戏剧学院、上海财经学院、华东纺织工学院、上海对外贸易学院、华东化工学院等院校的毕业生，向大会递交了决心书，表示坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席关于知识分子必须与工农群众相结合的教导，投入到新的战斗行列中去，向工人阶级、贫下中农、人民解放军学习，用火热的青春去写无产阶级革命和社会主义建设的壮丽诗篇，为人民立新功，建新劳。他们还表示，在即将走上新的革命征途的前夕，坚决贯彻执行毛主席关于教育革命的最新指示，站好最后一班岗，为无产阶级教育革命，为学校正在进行的斗批改，作出应有的贡献。
    上海第一医学院毕业生高俊鹏和华东师范大学毕业生刘东民还在会上报告了他们立志到农村、到边疆去安家落户的过程，受到与会者热烈的欢迎。
    上海市革命委员会的领导成员和上海工人革命造反总司令部的代表在会上向毕业生们表示热烈的祝贺。上海市革命委员会领导成员勉励毕业生们到新的战斗岗位以后，要坚持一辈子认真读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士，坚持革命到底，做坚定的彻底的无产阶级革命派。
