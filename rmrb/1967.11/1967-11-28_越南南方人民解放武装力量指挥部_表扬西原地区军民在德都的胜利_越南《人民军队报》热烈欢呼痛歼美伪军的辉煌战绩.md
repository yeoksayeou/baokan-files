The Command of the People's Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam sent a telegram on the 17th to the military and civilians of the Western Highlands, praising them for their great victory in annihilating and severely defeating the American and puppet forces in the Dak To area.

The telegram pointed out that the military and civilians of the Western Highlands have carried forward the tradition of the "Unyielding Western Highlands," overcome all difficulties and hardships, and actively implemented the call for a decisive winter-spring offensive by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front. They have opened the curtain on the brilliant winter-spring victories.

The telegram said, "This victory shows that our people's war is invincible."

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, the Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published a commentary on the 23rd, enthusiastically hailing the brilliant achievements of the People's Liberation Armed Forces in the Dak To area of Kontum Province, South Vietnam, in annihilating a large number of American and puppet forces.

The commentary said: The new victory in Dak To proves that after more than two years of fierce struggle with the U.S. invading forces, the People's Liberation Armed Forces have made a leap forward. The People's Liberation Armed Forces not only can annihilate a large number of enemy ground troops and restrict the activities of enemy aircraft and artillery but also can control important towns in the enemy's rear for the whole night. The commentary pointed out: It is obvious that as the winter-spring season approaches, the American bandits have suffered heavy blows in the mountains and plains, in the countryside and cities.

    据新华社河内电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方人民解放武装力量指挥部十七日打电报给西原地区军民，表扬他们在德都地区歼灭和重创美伪军的巨大胜利。
    电报指出，西原地区军民发扬了“不屈的西原”的传统，克服了一切艰难困苦，积极实现民族解放阵线中央委员会的冬春季决战决胜号召，揭开了战果辉煌的冬春大捷的序幕。
    电报说，这一胜利表明：我们的人民战争是无敌的。
    据新华社河内电  越南《人民军队报》二十三日发表评论，热烈欢呼越南南方昆嵩省德都地区人民解放武装力量大量歼灭美伪军的辉煌战绩。
    评论说：德都的新胜利证明，人民解放武装力量经过两年多来同美国侵略军进行激烈较量之后，已经飞跃成长。人民解放武装力量不仅能歼灭大量敌人的地面部队，限制敌军飞机、大炮的活动，而且还能够整夜控制敌人后方的重要市镇。评论指出：很明显，进入冬春季的时候，美国强盗在山区和平原，在农村和城市都遭到了沉重的打击。
