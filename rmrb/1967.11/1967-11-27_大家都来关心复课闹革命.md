Everyone Should Care About Resuming Classes and Making Revolution

After Hongqiao Second Primary School in Beijing's Chaoyang District resumed classes and made revolution, the classroom equipment needed repairs, but there was no carpenter available at the moment. What should be done? The solution is to mobilize the masses and do it ourselves.

The PLA comrades in charge of military training introduced the school's situation and problems at a parents' meeting, which immediately aroused the concern of the parents. Many parents expressed that they would definitely treat the school's difficulties as their own. The next day, some students' parents came to the school to help repair desks, chairs, doors, and windows. Some parents asked their children to bring home two chairs each day, and after work in the evening, they would repair them at home.

The workers from the Beijing Synthetic Fiber Factory's planing workshop, hearing the news, also came to actively support the school. They dispatched seven comrades to the school to help with the repairs.

The support from the workers and parents greatly encouraged the teachers and students. They are determined to seriously implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions and make the resumption of classes and revolution even better.

    大家都来关心复课闹革命
    北京朝阳区红庙第二小学复课闹革命后，教室设备需要维修，一时又找不到木工。怎么办？必须发动群众，自己动手。
    负责军训的解放军同志，在一次家长座谈会上介绍了学校的情况和问题，立即引起了家长们的关心。许多家长表示，一定要把学校的困难当成自己的困难。第二天，有的学生家长，到学校来，帮助修理桌椅和门窗。有的家长要自己的孩子每天从学校带回两张椅子，晚上下班后在家修理。
    学校附近的北京合成纤维厂机刨车间的工人闻讯后，也来积极支持，他们抽出七名同志来学校帮助修理。
    工人和家长们的支持，给师生们以很大的鼓舞。他们决心认真执行毛主席的最新指示，把复课闹革命搞得好上加好。
