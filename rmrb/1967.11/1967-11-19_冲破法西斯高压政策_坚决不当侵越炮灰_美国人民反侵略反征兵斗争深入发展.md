The struggle of American youth against the U.S. invasion of Vietnam and against conscription, following the large-scale demonstrations and storming of the U.S. Department of Defense on October 21, is now breaking through the fascist repression policies of the U.S. reactionary authorities and is developing deeply in many cities and universities.

Since early November, at the University of Iowa, University of California, University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Stanford University, and Hamilton College in New York City, students have launched struggles against military authorities, the CIA, and arms manufacturers recruiting on campus. The struggle at the University of California forced the CIA and "Dow Chemical Company" to halt their recruitment activities on November 7. On November 9, youth opposing the U.S. invasion of Vietnam threw Molotov cocktails at the draft center in Berkeley.

Facing the surging youth opposition to the Vietnam War, the U.S. reactionary ruling clique has fully revealed its fascist face. It has repeatedly dispatched large batches of armed police to invade universities, openly conducting large-scale arrests and beatings.

However, the U.S. reactionary ruling clique's repression measures can only further promote the struggle of American youth against the Vietnam War and against conscription. On November 8, when the New York City court summoned five youths who burned their draft cards, over a hundred youths rushed to the courthouse to demonstrate in support of the summoned youths. On the spot, four more youths publicly burned their draft cards.

On November 14, when U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk delivered a speech in New York defending the U.S. policy of invading Vietnam, a powerful anti-war demonstration erupted.

That day, more than 3,000 people in New York City braved the cold to hold a massive demonstration in front of the Hilton Hotel where Rusk was speaking. They held up signs reading "Bring the soldiers home," "Stop this dirty war," "Victory to the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam," and chanted slogans like "No, we won't go (to Vietnam)." They distributed anti-war leaflets and broke through the police barriers, charging towards the hotel. They also used stones, eggs, bottles, and plastic bags filled with red paint as weapons, engaging in fierce battles with the police.

Rusk was very afraid of the demonstrators and "took extraordinary measures, canceling (that day's) afternoon meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Sato in Washington," and sneaked out through the hotel's back door.

### 冲破法西斯高压政策　坚决不当侵越炮灰  美国人民反侵略反征兵斗争深入发展

    冲破法西斯高压政策　坚决不当侵越炮灰
    美国人民反侵略反征兵斗争深入发展
    本报综合报道　美国青年反对美国侵越战争，反对征兵的斗争，继十月二十一日大规模示威，冲击美国国防部以后，正冲破美国反动当局的法西斯高压政策，在许多城市和许多大学中深入发展。
    十一月初以来，在衣阿华大学，加利福尼亚大学，密执安大学，芝加哥大学，斯坦福大学和纽约市的汉密尔顿学院等院校内，都爆发了学生反对军事当局、中央情报局、军火制造商等到校内招募人员的斗争。加利福尼亚大学学生的斗争迫使中央情报局和“道氏化学公司”在七日停止了在这个学校里的招募活动。九日，反对美国侵越战争的青年还向伯克利市的征兵中心投掷燃烧弹。
    面临日益高涨的青年反对侵越战争的斗争，美国反动统治集团完全露出了狰狞的法西斯面目。它不断派遣大批武装警察，侵入各个大学，公开大规模抓人、打人。
    但是，美国反动统治集团的镇压措施，只能进一步促进美国青年反对侵越战争，反对征兵的斗争。八日，当纽约市法院传讯五名烧掉征兵证的青年时，一百多名青年闻讯赶来，在法院前举行了示威，支援被传讯的青年，当场又有四名青年当众烧掉了自己的征兵证。
    十四日，美国国务卿腊斯克在纽约发表为美国侵越政策辩解的演说时，爆发了一场反对侵越战争的强大的群众示威。
    当天，纽约市三千多群众，冒着严寒，在腊斯克发表演说的希尔顿旅馆前举行声势浩大的示威。他们高举“把士兵们撤回来”、“停止这场肮脏战争”、“南越民族解放阵线必胜”等标语，高呼“不，我们不去（越南）”的口号，散发反对侵越战争的传单，冲破警察设置的重重障碍，向旅馆冲去。他们还用石块、鸡蛋、瓶子和装满红色油漆的塑料袋等作武器，同警察展开激烈的搏斗。
    腊斯克十分害怕示威群众，“采取了极不寻常的行动，取消了（当天）下午同日本首相佐藤在华盛顿的会谈”，偷偷地“从旅馆的后门溜走”。
