Xinhua News Agency, November 19th – In the unprecedentedly good situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the Beijing Military Region of the People's Liberation Army concluded successfully yesterday. During the 18-day conference, the representatives, with the line of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self," summarized and exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and established the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the absolute authority of great Mao Zedong Thought.

Our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, as well as Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, Zhang Chunqiao, Chen Boda, and Yao Wenyuan, received all the representatives during the conference. This is the greatest care, encouragement, inspiration, and driving force for the conference.

During the conference, Comrades Chen Boda and Xie Fuzhi made important speeches. The responsible comrades of the various general departments and military branches of the People's Liberation Army, Yang Chengwu, Wu Faxian, Qiu Huizuo, Li Zuopeng, and Zhang Xiuquan, attended the closing ceremony of the conference.

Over 1,300 representatives attended this conference. They are soldiers who have made outstanding achievements in defending the motherland and in the "three supports, two militaries" work by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and have made new contributions to the people; they are excellent militia members who are both revolutionary vanguards and production models in the Cultural Revolution; they are military workers and family members of cadres who care about state affairs and have made contributions to the Cultural Revolution by actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. At the conference, the representatives seriously studied the series of extremely important instructions given by the great leader Chairman Mao on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the series of important speeches made by Vice Chairman Lin during the Cultural Revolution. The representatives fully expressed their profound class feelings and firm resolve to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought through their personal experiences in the struggle. This conference is a conference to highly praise the great commander Chairman Mao, a conference to further implement the latest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao to criticize revisionism and repudiate the self, and a conference to further implement the series of instructions given by Vice Chairman Lin on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought.

In the past year, the broad ranks of soldiers in the Beijing Military Region have, in the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line by extensively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, insisted on criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self, and promoted the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieving new successes. The experiences exchanged at the conference indicate that among countless experiences, the most fundamental experience is to firmly implement the series of important instructions given by Vice Chairman Lin on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, to use the "Three Articles" as a motto in the struggle between the two lines, to spark a revolution in the depths of the soul, to fight an offensive battle in criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self, to learn from Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example, to establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao, and to establish the absolute authority of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

The representatives unanimously believe that to establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, one must thoroughly study and apply the "Three Articles," use the brilliant thoughts in the "Three Articles" to guide every minute of our lives, and unify our spiritual world with the three images in the "Three Articles." They say: The "Three Articles" are the treasure for criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self, the textbook for running the great school of Mao Zedong Thought, and the guide for climbing the spiritual heights of communism. The "Three Articles" are the articles of public spirit, the articles of the soul. Those who are armed with the "Three Articles" can stand firm in the great winds and waves of class struggle, remain loyal to Mao Zedong Thought with a red heart that never changes; in the fierce struggle of the "three supports, two militaries," they can stand firm and follow the great strategic deployment of Chairman Mao; in the critical moments of life and death, they can face danger without fear and sacrifice themselves for the people; when personal and collective interests conflict, they can be selfless and dedicated to others. Therefore, those who turn the "Three Articles" into their souls are the most selfless, fearless, and invincible people. Everyone has deeply felt from practice that the most important thing in studying the "Three Articles" is to focus on the "use." They say: Whether to use or not is the question of whether to listen to Chairman Mao's words or not, whether to be loyal to Mao Zedong Thought or not. Only by focusing on the "use" can we see the big direction in the struggle between the two lines and follow Chairman Mao step by step, can we create a red world in the depths of the soul where the "public" character can move freely and the "self" character can hardly move, and can we quickly climb the spiritual heights of communism on the road of thought revolutionization.

To establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, one must spark a revolution in the depths of the soul and fight an offensive battle in criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self. The representatives believe that "self" and "revisionism" are the biggest obstacles to establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and they are not defeated or broken unless they are attacked. In criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self, it is not Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to just fight a defensive battle. Therefore, we must take an offensive posture, overthrow the "self," seize the power of "revisionism," destroy the den of "self," and uproot the black roots of "revisionism." How to fight an offensive battle? The representatives pointed out that we must insist on being bold and daring to fight, daring to strike directly. In terms of tactics, we must embody the spirit of "seizing the day," pursue and attack with the courage of Wu Song fighting tigers; in terms of strategy, we must embody the spirit of the "Long March," move mountains with the perseverance of Yu Gong. The representatives say: Criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self is a battle of breakthroughs, and we must insist on high standards and high attitudes, fearing nothing hard or difficult, concentrating firepower, and launching a fierce attack and annihilation. Criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self is a protracted war, and we must insist on fighting every day, all the time, everywhere, continuously revolutionizing, thoroughly revolutionizing, and forever preserving revolutionary youth. Criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self is a "people's war," and we must go to the masses, fight and criticize with the masses, and not "reflect in seclusion." Everyone unanimously pointed out that the great storm of mass struggle is a good classroom for criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self, with the most teachers, the most lively textbooks, the hardest questions, and the deepest touch on the soul. We must humbly learn from the revolutionary masses and treat the revolutionary rebels as our teachers to fight deeply and criticize thoroughly.

To establish the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought, one must learn from Vice Chairman Lin as a shining example and strive to learn from Vice Chairman Lin. Vice Chairman Lin has always been fully committed to establishing the absolute authority of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, giving the most correct, scientific, and sublime Marxist-Leninist evaluation of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and for decades has loyally defended, executed, and propagated the great Mao Zedong Thought, bravely defending Chairman Mao's highest leadership position.

Vice Chairman Lin has been firmly and unwaveringly advocating and promoting the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works throughout the army, the party, and the country, opening up a broad road for hundreds of millions of people to directly grasp Mao Zedong Thought, and creating the fundamental way to establish the absolute authority of the great commander Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. The representatives pointed out that learning from Vice Chairman Lin means learning from his consistent loyalty, decisiveness, and bravery in defending Chairman Mao, defending and executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Learn from his consistent high holding of the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, deeply understanding Mao Zedong Thought, actively propagating Mao Zedong Thought, skillfully applying Mao Zedong Thought creatively, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. Learn from Vice Chairman Lin as an example, truly become a good soldier of Chairman Mao by reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and becoming a good soldier of Chairman Mao.

At the conference, the responsible comrade of the Beijing Military Region, Zheng Weishan, made a summary report on establishing the absolute authority of the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought in the great struggle of criticizing revisionism and repudiating the self.

The conference commended a large number of advanced units and individuals, setting examples of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle. Among them are the Tianjin Yan'an Middle School Military Training Team, which, together with revolutionary youngsters, pioneered the realization of revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes and caused a great stir in the educational revolution; Camp Commander Liu Tiange, who has struggled for decades, been a humble student of the masses, and made the superior-subordinate relationship and the relationship between cadres and the masses very close; the People's Armed Forces Department of Pinggu County, Beijing, which has firmly supported the broad masses of the left and achieved new merits in the Cultural Revolution; the 5th Company of a certain unit, which has advanced victoriously along Chairman Mao's line of building the army; Wang Yinyu, the deputy political instructor of the militia camp of Qixian Brigade, Shanxi Province, who, in the class struggle, acts according to Chairman Mao's instructions, dares to fight, and dares to win.

    在伟大领袖毛主席关怀下北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会闭幕
    用毛泽东思想为武器打好斗私批修进攻战  以林彪副主席为榜样大树毛主席绝对权威
    陈伯达、谢富治同志到会作了重要讲话。大会表彰了大批先进单位和先进人物
    新华社十九日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好形势下，中国人民解放军北京部队学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，于昨天胜利闭幕。在历时十八天的大会上，代表们以“斗私，批修”为纲，总结交流了活学活用毛主席著作的经验，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席，以及周恩来、陈伯达、康生、李富春、江青、张春桥、戚本禹、姚文元等同志，在会议期间，接见了全体代表。这是对大会的最大关怀，最大鼓舞，最大激励，最大鞭策。
    会议期间，陈伯达同志、谢富治同志到会作了重要讲话。人民解放军各总部、各军种兵种负责人杨成武、吴法宪、邱会作、李作鹏、张秀川等同志出席了大会闭幕式。
    出席这次大会的一千三百多名代表，有活学活用毛主席著作，在保卫祖国和“三支”“两军”工作中，作出显著成绩，为人民立了新功的指战员；有活学活用毛主席著作，在文化大革命中既当革命闯将，又当生产模范的优秀民兵；有活学活用毛主席著作，关心国家大事，为文化大革命作出贡献的部队职工和干部家属。会上，代表们认真地学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的一系列极为重要的指示，学习了林副主席在文化大革命中一系列的重要讲话。代表们以斗争中的切身体会，充分表达了对毛主席无限深厚的阶级感情和无限忠于毛泽东思想的坚强决心。这次大会，是大赞大颂伟大统帅毛主席的颂扬大会，是进一步贯彻伟大领袖毛主席要斗私，批修最新指示的誓师大会，是进一步落实林副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作一系列指示，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的誓师大会。
    一年多来，北京部队广大指战员在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，为捍卫毛主席革命路线大学大用毛主席著作，坚持斗私批修，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推进到一个新阶段，取得了新成就。大会交流的经验表明，千条经验万条经验，最根本的经验，就是要坚决贯彻执行林彪副主席关于活学活用毛主席著作的一系列重要指示，在两条路线斗争中，以“老三篇”为座右铭，在灵魂深处爆发革命，在斗私批修中打进攻战，以林副主席为光辉榜样，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席的绝对权威，大树特树伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    代表们一致认为，要大树特树伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，必须狠学狠用“老三篇”，用“老三篇”的光辉思想指挥我们生命的每一分钟，用“老三篇”中的三个形象统一我们的精神世界。他们说：“老三篇”是斗私批修的法宝，是办好毛泽东思想大学校的教材，是攀登共产主义精神境界的指南。“老三篇”是公字篇，是灵魂篇。用“老三篇”武装起来的人，在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，就能顶狂风，战恶浪，忠于毛泽东思想的红心永不变；在“三支”“两军”激烈斗争中，就能立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，紧跟毛主席伟大战略部署永向前；在生死存亡的危急关头，就能临危不惧，挺身而出，牺牲自己为人民；在个人和集体的利益发生矛盾时，就能大公无私，毫不利己，专门利人。因此，用“老三篇”化作灵魂的人，才是最无私、最无畏、最无敌的人。大家从实践中深深体会到，学习“老三篇”，最要紧的就是要在“用”字上狠下功夫。他们说：用不用是听不听毛主席的话的问题，是忠不忠于毛泽东思想的问题。只有在“用”字上狠下功夫，才能在两条路线斗争中看清大方向、步步紧跟毛主席，才能在灵魂深处打出一个“公”字畅行无阻、“私”字寸步难行的红彤彤的新世界，才能在思想革命化的征途上迅速攀登共产主义的精神高峰。
    大树特树伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，必须在灵魂深处爆发革命，在斗私批修中打进攻战。代表们认为，“私”和“修”是大树特树毛主席和毛泽东思想绝对权威的最大障碍，是不打不倒、不攻不破的。在斗私批修中，光打防御战，就不是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。因此，我们必须以进攻的姿态，革“私”字的命，夺“修”字的权，捣“私”字的老窝，挖掉“修”字的黑根。怎样打进攻战？代表们指出，必须坚持“敢”字当头，“斗”字开道，敢于主动出击，敢于刺刀见红。在战术上发扬“只争朝夕”的精神，以武松打虎的勇气，穷追猛打；在战略上发扬“万里长征”的精神，以愚公移山的韧劲，挖“山”不止。代表们说：斗私批修是一场攻坚战，必须坚持高姿态、高标准，不怕硬，不怕难，集中火力，猛攻围歼。斗私批修是一场持久战，必须坚持天天斗，时时斗，处处斗，不断革命，彻底革命，永葆革命青春。斗私批修是一场“人民战争”，必须到群众中去，和群众一起斗，一起批，不能“闭门思过”。大家一致指出，群众斗争的大风雨，是斗私批修的好课堂，教员最多，教材最活，考题最硬，触及灵魂最深。必须虚心向革命群众学习，拜无产阶级革命派为师，才能斗得深，批得透。
    大树特树伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想的绝对权威，必须以林副主席为光辉典范，努力向林副主席学习。林副主席一贯地全力树立毛主席和毛泽东思想的绝对权威，对光焰无际的毛泽东思想作出了最正确、最科学、最崇高的马克思列宁主义的评价，几十年如一日忠实捍卫、执行、宣传了伟大的毛泽东思想，英勇地捍卫毛主席的最高领袖地位。
    林副主席在全军、全党、全国坚定不移地积极倡导、全力推进活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，开辟了亿万群众直接掌握毛泽东思想的广阔道路，创造了大树特树伟大统帅毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的根本途径。代表们指出，向林副主席学习，就要学习他一贯最忠诚、最坚决、最英勇保卫毛主席，保卫和执行毛主席的革命路线。学习他一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，最深刻地领会毛泽东思想，最积极地宣传毛泽东思想，最善于创造性地运用毛泽东思想，最英勇地捍卫毛泽东思想，以林副主席为榜样，真正做到读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。
    会上，北京部队负责人郑维山作了在斗私批修的伟大斗争中，大树特树伟大领袖毛主席和伟大的毛泽东思想绝对权威的总结报告。
    大会表彰了大批先进单位和先进人物，树立了在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的样板。其中有同革命小将一起首创以教学班为基础实现革命大联合，大闹教育革命的天津延安中学军训团；有艰苦奋斗几十年，甘当群众小学生，把上下级关系、干群关系搞得亲密无间的营长刘天革；有坚定不移地支持左派广大群众，在文化大革命中立新功的北京市平谷县人民武装部；有沿着毛主席建军路线胜利前进的某部五连；有在阶级斗争中，按毛主席指示办事，敢于斗争，敢于胜利的山西省忻县奇村大队民兵营副教导员王银娥等。
