In the early stages of the Cultural Revolution, I carried out the capitalist reactionary line, and the revolutionary youngsters demanded that I make a self-criticism. Due to my incorrect view of the masses and my belief that the revolutionary youngsters were not helping me, I felt very aggrieved.

Great Mao Zedong Thought educated me, and the revolutionary youngsters helped me. I re-studied Chairman Mao's discussion on the mass movement in his "Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan," which gave me great enlightenment. The practice of struggle also made me deeply feel that the mass movement is naturally reasonable. During an encounter with the revolutionary youngsters, a student who had been labeled a "counter-revolutionary" by me said to me: "From my experience and feelings, I hate you, but I will support you and help you according to Chairman Mao's policy for cadres!" Another time, the revolutionary youngsters, who had very few tickets to the struggle meeting against a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Shanghai Municipal Committee, gave me one and wrote on it: "Welcome cadres back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line." I was deeply moved. During the meeting, several former Red Guards who had been severely persecuted by me sat next to me. Based on the materials criticized and exposed at the meeting, they pointed out to me where I had carried out the capitalist reactionary line and what lessons I should learn, and helped me correct my attitude towards the mass movement.

With the help of the revolutionary youngsters, I began to recognize my mistakes. The youngsters, based on Chairman Mao's policy for cadres, liberated me and asked me to make new contributions. At this time, my "selfishness" resurfaced. I thought that the struggle among the five mass organizations in the school was very sharp, and my old accounts had not been settled. I didn't want to incur new debts by inciting the masses to fight each other. I brought this problem to study Chairman Mao's works and accepted the help of the masses. I gradually realized that this was still the "selfishness" at work. The root of the mistake is not in how much work is done, but in the "selfishness." I dared not stand out and go to the sharpest contradictions, actually wanting to protect myself. When my thoughts became clear, I went among the masses and studied with them how to achieve revolutionary great unity.

At the beginning, I encountered some difficulties. For example, some said I didn't understand the situation and was going to interfere blindly. Hearing this, I felt aggrieved again. But I thought, as a Communist Party member, for the revolutionary cause, can't I even listen to a little criticism and always be concerned with personal gains and losses? Chairman Mao teaches us: "If your method benefits the people, we will follow it." So, I actively sought out the youngsters to have heart-to-heart talks, and the more we understood each other, the better our relationship became.

At that time, there were fierce debates among the students, and there was even the possibility of armed conflict. I was very afraid to get involved. Later, I studied the "Three Articles" and decided to break away from selfishness and establish public-mindedness, changing my timid attitude. Once, two factions of youngsters were about to fight over a broadcasting room. I accepted the lessons of the past, actively went between the two factions, pointed out that there was no fundamental conflict of interest among the students, and that the current opposition was the result of the capitalist reactionary line, the responsibility was mine. The masses are reasonable. I took responsibility and, after repeated persuasion, finally avoided an armed conflict. From this, I deeply felt that contradictions are objectively existing. The more you avoid them, the more the masses will have complaints. Only by going to the sharpest contradictions and criticizing the capitalist reactionary line with the masses can you gain the trust of the masses and complete the tasks assigned by the Party.

Later, I worked with the revolutionary youngsters to promote the great unity of revolutionary mass organizations in the school and to achieve the revolutionary three-in-one combination.

I will forever read Chairman Mao's books, forever struggle against selfishness and criticize revisionism, forever believe in the masses, forever be with the masses, and forever be a servant of the people!

    到矛盾最尖锐的第一线去
    上海天山中学革命委员会主任委员原天山中学党支部书记兼校长钟国端
    文化大革命初期，我执行了资产阶级反动路线，革命小将要我检查。由于我对群众有不正确的看法，并且不认为革命小将是帮助我，因此委屈情绪很大。
    伟大的毛泽东思想教育了我，革命小将帮助了我。我重新学习了毛主席在《湖南农民运动考察报告》中关于群众运动的论述，得到了很大启发；斗争的实践也使我深切感到群众运动是天然合理的。在一次和革命小将接触中，一个曾经被我打成“反革命”的学生对我说：“从我的遭遇和感情来说，我是恨你的，但是，我要按照毛主席的干部政策来支持你，帮助你！”又有一次，革命小将拿到了为数很少的斗争旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大会的入场券，他们给我一张，并写上：“欢迎干部回到毛主席的革命路线上来。”我看了十分激动。开会时，几个过去受我迫害最严重的红卫兵小将坐在我旁边，根据会上批判、揭发的材料，他们一边指出我在哪些方面执行了资产阶级反动路线，哪些问题要吸取教训，一边帮我端正对群众运动的态度。
    在革命小将的帮助下，我开始认识了自己的错误。小将们根据毛主席的干部政策解放了我，并要我立新功。这时，我的“私”字又露头了。我想，学校里五个群众组织之间斗争很尖锐，我的老账没有还清，不要又欠下挑动群众斗群众的新账，一起算就不得了。我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作，又接受了群众的帮助。我渐渐认识到这还是“私”字在作怪。犯错误的根子不在工作多少，而在于“私”字。我不敢挺身而出到矛盾最尖锐的地方去，其实是想保自己。我思想通了，就到群众中去，和他们一起研究实现革命大联合的问题。
    开始时，碰到了一些困难。例如有人说我不了解情况，又要来瞎指挥了。听了这话，我心里又产生了委屈情绪。但是，我想，一个共产党员，为了革命事业，难道连一点意见也听不进，老是在个人得失上打圈子吗？毛主席教导我们：“你说的办法对人民有好处，我们就照你的办。”于是，我就积极地找小将们谈心，彼此了解得多了，关系也就逐渐改善了。
    当时，同学中出现了激烈争论，甚至有可能发生武斗。我很怕介入。后来，我学习了“老三篇”，决心破私立公，改变这种畏畏缩缩的态度。有一次，两派小将为了争夺一间广播室，又有可能发生武斗了。我接受了以前的教训，主动到两派中间去，指出同学之间并没有根本的利害冲突，现在的对立，是资产阶级反动路线造成的恶果，责任在我。群众是通情达理的。我把责任担当起来，又经过反复劝说，终于避免了一场武斗。从这里，我深深体会到，矛盾是客观存在的，你越躲，群众越是有意见。只有深入到矛盾最尖锐的地方去，和群众一起批判资产阶级反动路线，才能取得群众的信任，完成党交给我的任务。
    后来，我又和革命小将一起，为促进学校革命群众组织的大联合和实现革命三结合作了应有的努力。
    我要永远读毛主席的书，永远斗私批修，永远相信群众，永远和群众在一起，永远做人民的勤务员！
