The great farce staged by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique in the name of commemorating the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution has come to an end after a lot of fanfare.

The traitors Brezhnev and Kosygin have been busy for a whole year to put on this show. They prepared gifts, sent invitations, and while they were beautifying their facade, they were also boasting about themselves. During the festival, they were busy awarding medals and giving speeches, truly making a big fuss. They spared no effort to put on a successful show, all in an attempt to use the world's respect for the Soviet people, who lit the torch of the October Revolution, to deceive and cover up their betrayal.

However, as our great leader Chairman Mao said, "It is like acting in a play. Some actors play villainous roles very well, but when they play heroic roles, they always fail to be convincing, acting unnaturally."

The Soviet revisionist clique, despite all their efforts, did not achieve the stage effect they hoped for. In the eyes of the people of the world, their clumsy disguise performance is truly disgusting. No matter how much makeup Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their gang of October Revolution traitors put on, they can never hide their true villainous faces.

The 50th anniversary of the great October Revolution is a revolutionary holiday for the proletariat. However, the Soviet revisionist traitor clique actually used this revolutionary holiday to engage in counter-revolutionary collusion. Figures like Tito and Djilas, these traitors and strike-breakers, as well as the leader of the Indian reactionaries, Indira Gandhi, were all "guests of honor" in Moscow on the day of the October Revolution. Even the head of American imperialism came to support the Soviet revisionist clique, praising the "coexistence" of the US and the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionist traitors actually spent the October Revolution holiday in a "honeymoon" with American imperialism, which is an intolerable insult to the great October Revolution!

The Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly claimed that they are standing on the "peak of half a century" to review the journey of the Soviet people, brazenly portraying themselves as the "heirs" of the October Revolution. For this despicable purpose, they used the trick of adding a tail to a dog, mixing the glorious history of the first thirty-plus years under the wise leadership of Lenin and Stalin with the ugly history of the past decade under the revisionist rule of the Khrushchev clique, and then falsifying and defaming the history of the first thirty-plus years according to their revisionist views.

In their mouths, the great October Socialist Revolution, which opened a new era in human history, was not a revolution where the proletariat used violence to smash the bourgeois state machine and establish proletarian dictatorship, but rather a result of using "legal and illegal, peaceful and non-peaceful" forms of struggle; the period of socialist transformation and socialist construction in the Soviet Union was not a period of sharp and complex class struggle, but a period of "consistency of interests" among all classes in economic, social, political, and ideological aspects; the great Patriotic War led by Stalin against Hitler fascism was not a war that established an indelible historical merit for all mankind, but a great disaster filled with "unparalleled" pain and "the most miserable scenes." According to these claims, where is the glorious history of the October Revolution? Where are the great achievements of the Soviet people? The Soviet revisionist clique's shameless desecration of Soviet history is proof that they are traitors to the October Revolution.

The likes of Brezhnev, who claim to be commemorating the October Revolution, are actually doing the opposite. Their "outline" and Brezhnev's "report" for commemorating the October Revolution are all thorough revisionist poisonous weeds.

In this "outline" and "report," they openly deny the principle of violent revolution, advocating so-called "diversified" paths and promoting "peaceful transition." They erase class struggle, betray proletarian dictatorship, and advocate "people's states" to cover up the bourgeois dictatorship of the Soviet revisionist clique. They boast about the "economic incentive system," insisting on a full restoration of capitalism. They betray proletarian internationalism, reducing Soviet foreign policy to avoiding "a world thermonuclear war," advocating "complete and thorough disarmament" and "peaceful coexistence." They vehemently oppose Marxism-Leninism, fully endorsing the revisionist line of the 20th, 22nd, and 23rd Congresses of the CPSU, and insisting on the revisionist program of the CPSU. This once again shows that the likes of Brezhnev are the faithful inheritors of the entire legacy of Khrushchev.

In the activities to commemorate the October Revolution, the Soviet revisionist clique fiercely attacked the Communist Party of China, attacked the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and openly named and attacked our great leader Chairman Mao. The traitors of the October Revolution and Marxism-Leninism fiercely oppose us, which precisely proves that we are the true inheritors of the October Revolution, the resolute defenders of Marxism-Leninism, and precisely proves that Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the people of the world.

The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has shaken the "throne" of the Soviet revisionist clique, and the sunlight of great Mao Zedong Thought has exposed all the ghosts and monsters. How could the small group of traitors like Brezhnev and Kosygin not gnash their teeth in hatred and curse fiercely?

The farce staged by the Soviet revisionist clique not only further exposed their counter-revolutionary faces but also fully reflected their difficult and embarrassing situation and their pathetic appearance of being "silver-plated but with an iron core."

They tried their best to sell the entire set of Khrushchev's revisionist goods but were hesitant and ashamed, not daring to admit that they are faithful disciples of Khrushchev. The "outline" of the Soviet revisionist clique and Brezhnev's "report" even "forgot their ancestors," not daring to mention Khrushchev's "great name," as if there was never such a notorious villain in the political history of the Soviet Union. How embarrassing!

To bolster their own morale, Brezhnev and Kosygin and their ilk used this festival opportunity to hasten the plot to convene an anti-China, counter-revolutionary black meeting. However, no matter how loudly they shout, their followers are scattered and disorganized, unable to form a decent formation. From the Moscow March split meeting of the previous year to the European new strike-breaker meeting this April, the Soviet revisionist clique has spent a lot of effort to plot this black meeting, but until now, it has not been successful. This fully shows that the Soviet revisionist clique is facing numerous contradictions and that their days are getting worse.

Now, the farce staged by the Soviet revisionist clique during the festival has ended. However, their entire farce has not ended. They will continue to act scene by scene. But one day, the storm of a new "October Revolution" will surely sweep this gang of traitors off the stage of history!

    十月革命叛徒的大丑剧
    本报评论员
    苏修叛徒集团上演的所谓“纪念”十月革命五十周年的大丑剧，吹吹打打一阵之后，算是收场了。
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙叛徒，为了演这一场戏，忙了整整一年。他们又是办年货，又是发请帖；一面修饰门面，一面自吹自擂。到了节日期间，更是一会儿授勋发奖，一会儿登台演讲，真是闹得个不亦乐乎。他们这样不惜工本，一心要演一场叫座的戏，无非是企图利用全世界人民对于点燃了十月革命火炬的苏联人民的尊敬，进行招摇撞骗，来掩盖自己的背叛。
    但是，正如我们伟大领袖毛主席说过的：“好象唱戏一样，有些演员演反派人物很象，演正派人物老是不大象，装腔作势，不大自然。”
    苏修集团虽然费了九牛二虎之力，并没有产生他们所希望的舞台效果。在全世界人民看来，他们这种拙劣的化装表演，实在令人作呕。勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一伙十月革命的叛徒，无论怎样浓装艳抹，也绝对遮不住反派角色的本来面目。
    伟大的十月革命五十周年，是无产阶级的革命节日。然而，苏修叛徒集团居然利用这个革命节日来进行反革命的大勾结。什么铁托，什么丹吉，这些叛徒、工贼以及印度反动派的头目英迪拉·甘地，在十月革命的节日里，都成了莫斯科的“上宾”。而美帝国主义的头目也出来为苏修集团捧场，赞扬美苏“共处”。苏修叛徒竟然在十月革命节同美帝共度“蜜月”，这简直是对伟大十月革命的不能令人容忍的污辱！
    苏修集团大言不惭地说什么他们站在“半个世纪的山峰上”回顾苏联人民的历程，恬不知耻地把自己打扮成为十月革命的“继承者”。为了这个卑鄙目的，他们玩弄狗尾续貂的手法，把苏联在列宁、斯大林英明领导下的前三十多年光荣历史，同赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡政后的十多年丑恶历史混为一谈，并且按照自己的修正主义观点去篡改和丑化前三十多年的历史。
    在他们的口里，开辟人类历史新纪元的伟大的十月社会主义革命，不是无产阶级用暴力打碎资产阶级国家机器、建立无产阶级专政的革命，而是什么运用“合法的与不合法的、和平的与非和平的”“斗争形式”的结果；苏联社会主义改造和社会主义建设时期，不是经历着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，而是存在着各阶级“在经济、社会政治和思想等方面利益的一致”；苏联人民在斯大林领导下抗击希特勒法西斯的伟大卫国战争，不是对全人类建立了不可磨灭的历史功勋，而是充满“无法比拟”的“痛苦”和“最凄惨景象”的大灾难。按照这些说法，哪里还有什么十月革命的光荣历史？哪里还有什么苏联人民的丰功伟绩？苏修集团这样无耻地糟踏苏联的历史，正好证明他们是十月革命的叛徒。
    勃列日涅夫之流这一伙叛徒，打的是“纪念”十月革命的旗号，干的恰恰是反十月革命的勾当。他们“纪念”十月革命的“提纲”和勃列日涅夫的“报告”，通通是彻头彻尾的修正主义大毒草。
    在这个“提纲”和“报告”中，他们公然否定暴力革命的原则，鼓吹所谓“多样化”的道路，宣扬“和平过渡”。他们抹煞阶级斗争，背叛无产阶级专政，宣扬“全民国家”，来掩盖苏修集团的资产阶级专政。他们吹嘘“经济刺激体制”，坚持全面复辟资本主义。他们背叛无产阶级国际主义，把苏联的对外政策归结为避免“一场世界热核战争”，宣扬“全面彻底裁军”和“和平共处”。他们大反马克思列宁主义，全盘肯定苏共二十大、二十二大、二十三大的赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线，坚持苏共修正主义纲领。这就又一次表明，勃列日涅夫之流是赫鲁晓夫全套衣钵的忠实继承人。
    苏修集团在“纪念”十月革命的活动中，疯狂攻击中国共产党，攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，公开指名攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席。十月革命的叛徒、马克思列宁主义的叛徒猖狂地反对我们，恰恰证明我们是十月革命的真正继承者，是马克思列宁主义的坚决捍卫者，恰恰证明毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，是全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利震撼了苏修集团的“宝座”，伟大的毛泽东思想的阳光把一切魑魅魍魉都照得无地藏身。勃列日涅夫、柯西金这一小撮叛徒，怎能不切齿痛恨，疯狂咒骂呢？
    苏修集团的这一场表演，不仅进一步暴露了他们的反革命面目，也充分反映了他们困难重重的狼狈处境和一副“银样镴枪头”的窘相。
    他们竭力贩卖赫鲁晓夫的全套修正主义货色，却又躲躲闪闪，羞羞答答，不敢承认自己是赫鲁晓夫的忠实门徒。苏修集团的“提纲”和勃列日涅夫的“报告”居然“数典忘祖”，连赫鲁晓夫的“大名”也不敢提，好象在苏联的政治历史中就根本没有这么一个臭名远扬的丑角。真是何等的尴尬呀！
    勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流为了给自己撑撑场面，壮壮胆色，利用这次节日机会加紧策划召开反华、反革命的黑会。但是，尽管他们叫得多么声嘶力竭，摇旗呐喊的娄罗还是七零八落，参差不齐，摆不成一个象样的阵势。从前年的莫斯科三月分裂会议，到今年四月的欧洲新工贼会议，苏修集团为了策划这个黑会不知费了多少心血，但是直到如今仍然没有着落。这集中地说明了：苏修集团面临着重重的矛盾，日子越来越不好混了。
    现在，苏修集团在节日上演的这一场丑剧是收场了。而他们的整个丑剧却并未结束。他们还是要一幕一幕地继续演下去的。但是，总有一天，新的“十月革命”的风暴，终将把这一伙叛徒通通扫出历史的舞台！
