Celebration and Telegram of Respect to Chairman Mao from the Establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee

	New China News Agency, Hohhot, November 1st: The telegram of respect from the celebration of the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee to Chairman Mao is as follows:

	Most Respected and Beloved Great Leader Chairman Mao:

	We, the revolutionary masses and people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, are filled with joyful excitement as we report to you a thrilling piece of news: Under the great situation of the unprecedentedly good development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and under the guidance of your great policy of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness," the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has been established!

	This is a great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by you in the northern frontier and the frontline against revisionism of our motherland!

	This is another great achievement created by the People's Liberation Army of China, which you personally founded, in the "three supports and two militaries" work!

	This is another great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you!

	This is another triumphant song of your brilliant thoughts resounding through the clouds!

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! Under your guidance, our great helmsman, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia has achieved decisive victories. Today, we revolutionary masses have united and finally seized back the party, government, financial, and cultural powers usurped by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Inner Mongolia! We have seized them all! The annals of a thousand years open a new chapter, and the rivers and mountains of the land put on new clothes. Under your wise leadership, Inner Mongolia will definitely become a new realm of brilliant Mao Zedong Thought.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! At this moment of celebrating the great festival of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, our hearts surge with waves of emotion, our blood boils with joy, and tears of happiness flow as we look up to your towering image. We shout a thousand times, ten thousand times: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live for ten thousand years! We sincerely wish you, our dear leader, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! As we turn the pages of the revolutionary history of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, which page does not shine with your great thoughts? As we look back on the revolutionary journey of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, which step has not been guided by you? You are the great savior of all ethnic groups, you are the red sun in the hearts of all ethnic groups.

	It is you who led the great people's revolution, smashed the shackles of class oppression, and broke the chains of national oppression, liberating the laboring people of all ethnic groups.

	It is you who founded the great People's Republic of China, turning the former prison of all ethnic groups into a socialist family.

	It is you who formulated the brilliant policy to solve the national question within the country, achieving regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia, establishing a proletarian dictatorship, and making the laboring people of all ethnic groups the masters of the country.

	It is you who wisely pointed out: "Only socialism can save China," guiding the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia onto the broad road to socialism and building a golden bridge to communism.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! Your brilliant theories arm our minds; the sunlight of your great thoughts shines over the Inner Mongolian grasslands. The heavens change, the earth changes, and people change too; the rivers and mountains put on new clothes. From the northern foothills of the Greater Khingan Range to the foot of the Helan Mountains, everywhere is a scene of prosperity.

	Just as we, the people of all ethnic groups, are building our great socialist motherland with great enthusiasm, the Khrushchov of China and his agents in Inner Mongolia want to turn back the wheels of history and push the people of all ethnic groups back into the abyss of disaster. Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! It is you who saw through the great conspiracy of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, with the great courage and daring of a great proletarian revolutionary, personally initiating and leading this world-shaking Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the first great revolution initiated by the proletariat within a proletarian dictatorship state.

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! You have brilliantly, creatively, and epoch-makingly developed Marxism-Leninism, opening up a new era for the international communist movement. With you, the future of the world revolution is bright, and with you, the future of mankind is brilliant and glorious. We, the people of all ethnic groups, living in the new era of brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, feel extremely proud and honored!

	We revolutionary masses, following your theory, line, policy, and principles of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and adhering to your teachings of "paying attention to state affairs and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," closely follow your great strategic deployments. We raise high the banner of revolutionary rebellion is justified and charge at the command center of the bourgeoisie. We have exposed the agents of the Khrushchov of China in Inner Mongolia—a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists and national separatists—and smashed their evil plot to restore capitalism and sabotage national unity and the unity of the motherland. We have cut off the black hand of the Khrushchov of China reaching into Inner Mongolia. This battle is well fought, and it is indeed well fought! We have dug out a big "time bomb" buried in the north of the motherland, eliminated a major hidden danger for the people of all ethnic groups, and given the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries a heavy blow!

	The "January Revolution" storm swept across the country. At this crucial moment when the revolutionary masses were pressing their advantage, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party jumped out with tenfold ferocity and a hundredfold hatred, rallying the ghosts and snakes of society to launch a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary masses. At this critical moment, could we retreat? No! Absolutely not! The wheels of history cannot be turned back! We revolutionary masses, facing the cold wind and battling the waves, repelled the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism and passed the severe test.

	Revolution is closer to Beijing, and rebellion makes Chairman Mao even dearer. Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the midst of life-and-death struggles and stormy waves, it was your great thoughts that gave us boundless strength. With tears in our eyes and deep affection, we sang again and again: "Looking up at the Big Dipper, thinking of Mao Zedong." Thinking of you, our hearts are red and our eyes are bright; thinking of you, our will is firm, our courage is strong, and our bones are hard. In the days and nights when we revolutionary masses were besieged and persecuted, we held your little red book and read aloud time and again, "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory," using our blood and lives to defend your revolutionary line and your boundless great thoughts.

	The majestic Great Qing Mountains, the vast Greater Khingan Range, the rolling Yellow River, and the endless green grasslands—where is there not a surging revolutionary storm? Where is there not a surging current of struggle? Where is there not a battle cry that shakes the mountains and rivers? Where is there not a heart-pounding, intense struggle!

	A thunderous clap opens a new universe, and a thousand-mile east wind sweeps away the remaining clouds. On April 13th, on this very day, the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the handling of the Inner Mongolia issue, personally approved by you, was announced! It was like a spring thunder, dispersing the clouds that had temporarily hung over Inner Mongolia; it was like a bright lamp, illuminating the course of the Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia. In the most difficult days, the People's Liberation Army of China, which you personally founded, gave us the most timely and resolute support, providing us with great encouragement and strength. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia, following the course you indicated, moved from one victory to another. The current situation is better than ever. From factories, shops, to offices and schools, from cities to rural and pastoral areas, from children of ten or so to elderly people with white hair, everyone is concerned about state affairs. The masses have never been mobilized as broadly and deeply as they are today. Your brilliant thoughts have never been as deeply rooted in people's hearts as they are now. People's spiritual outlook has never been as enthusiastic as it is today. The people of all ethnic groups have never been as closely united as they are now. Our proletarian dictatorship has never been as strong and powerful as it is today.

	Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! All of this is condensed with your tireless efforts for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Inner Mongolia. Even the best singers on the grasslands, playing the most melodious horsehead fiddles, singing a million beautiful songs of praise, cannot fully express our boundless love and respect for you.

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! You have taught us: "The Chinese revolution is great, but the road after the revolution is longer, the work is greater, and more arduous." Under the illumination of your brilliant thoughts, we have seized power from the hands of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in Inner Mongolia. "This is only the first step of the ten-thousand-mile long march." With you supporting us, we will definitely make you proud. We will definitely use your brilliant thoughts to hold power, use power well, cherish victory, consolidate victory, and develop victory!

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! Your recently proposed fundamental policy of "criticizing revisionism and repudiating selfishness" and a series of latest instructions are the most scientific, most complete, most profound, and most thorough summary of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year and more. They are the most powerful ideological weapons to ensure the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We support them a thousand times and will carry them out ten thousand times. We vow to be the vanguard of criticizing revisionism and the pioneers of repudiating selfishness. We will forever study and apply your great works, forever take your brilliant "Three Constantly Read Articles" as our motto, fiercely criticize selfishness, and firmly establish public-mindedness. We will carry out a revolution in our souls, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, and achieve new merits for the people in the struggle against selfishness and revisionism. We will carry out a more extensive and in-depth revolutionary criticism, concentrate our firepower and targets, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, overthrow and expose the Khrushchov of China and his agents in Inner Mongolia. We will combine this with the good work of struggle, criticism, and transformation in our region and units, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution and the three-in-one combination, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! You have taught us: "Wholeheartedly serve the people and never leave the masses," "be both an 'official' and a common person." We will always remember this teaching and never forget it. We will definitely wholeheartedly serve the people, maintain close ties with the masses, work diligently and conscientiously, and forever maintain the spirit of hard struggle, preventing the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, insisting on criticism and self-criticism, achieving the revolutionization of thought, and forever preserving revolutionary youth.

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! You have taught us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of various nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees for the success of our cause." We will definitely carry out the "support the army and love the people" movement more deeply, broadly, persistently, and enthusiastically, consolidate the unity of the country, strengthen the unity of various nationalities, strengthen the proletarian dictatorship, and resolutely suppress the spies of the United States, Chiang Kai-shek, the Soviet Union, Mongolia, revisionists, and Japan. We will make the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region an impregnable anti-revisionist Great Wall in the northern frontier of the motherland. Let all class enemies at home and abroad be smashed to pieces in front of the copper walls and iron walls of our great socialist motherland!

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! We will definitely respond to your great call and grasp revolution, promote production, work, and preparedness, and do a better job in all aspects!

	Most Respected and Beloved Chairman Mao! You are our great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman. We solemnly pledge to you: We will forever be infinitely loyal to you, infinitely loyal to your brilliant thoughts, and infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by you. We will forever follow you and bravely advance in the great winds and waves! We will definitely use your brilliant thoughts to guide everything, reform everything, and promote everything. We will regard the study and application of your great works as higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. In all fields, we will further establish your absolute authority and the absolute authority of your brilliant thoughts. We will plant your brilliant red flag of thoughts in every inch of Inner Mongolia and turn Inner Mongolia into a great school of brilliant Mao Zedong Thought!

	We sincerely wish you, the brightest red sun in our hearts, the great savior of all ethnic groups, eternal life! Eternal life! Eternal life!

　　给毛主席的致敬电
    新华社呼和浩特一日电　内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立和庆祝大会给毛主席的致敬电，全文如下：最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席：
    我们内蒙古自治区的无产阶级革命派和各族革命人民，满怀胜利的喜悦，向您报告一个激动人心的喜讯：在无产阶级文化大革命空前大好的形势下，在您的“斗私，批修”伟大方针的指导下，内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立了！
    这是您领导的无产阶级文化大革命在祖国北部边疆、反修前哨阵地上的一次大捷！
    这是您亲手缔造的中国人民解放军在“三支”“两军”工作中创造的又一丰功伟绩！
    这是以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线的又一伟大胜利！
    这是您光辉思想的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！在您，我们的伟大舵手指引下，内蒙古自治区的无产阶级文化大革命，取得了决定性的胜利。今天，我们无产阶级革命派联合起来，终于把内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派窃取的党、政、财、文大权夺回来了！统统夺回来了！千年青史开新篇，大地河山换新装。在您的英明领导下，内蒙古一定要成为红彤彤的毛泽东思想的新天地。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！在欢庆内蒙古各族人民这个盛大节日的时刻，我们心潮滔滔逐浪高，热血沸腾喜泪流，仰望着您老人家的高大形象，一千遍，一万遍地高呼：毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！我们最最衷心地祝愿您老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
    毛主席啊，毛主席！掀开内蒙古各族人民革命的史册，哪一页不闪烁着您伟大思想的光芒；回顾内蒙古各族人民的战斗道路，哪一程不是您步步指引。您是各族人民的大救星，您是各族人民心中的红太、阳。
    是您，领导的伟大的人民革命，砸烂了阶级压迫的桎梏，打碎了民族压迫的枷锁，使各族劳动人民获得了翻身和解放。
    是您，缔造了伟大的中华人民共和国，把昔日各族人民的牢狱变成了社会主义大家庭。
    是您，制定了解决国内民族问题的光辉政策，使内蒙古实现了区域自治，建立了无产阶级专政的政权，各族劳动人民当家做主人。
    是您，英明地指出：“只有社会主义能够救中国”，指引着内蒙古各族人民走上了社会主义的康庄大道，搭起了通向共产主义的金桥。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！您天才的理论，武装着我们的思想；您伟大思想的阳光，普照着内蒙古草原。天变地变人更变，锦绣河山换新颜。从大兴安岭北麓到贺兰山脚下，到处是一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    就在我们各族人民意气风发地建设伟大社会主义祖国的时候，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，要使历史的车轮倒转，要把各族人民重新推入灾难的深渊。最最敬爱的毛主席！是您洞察了这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的大阴谋，以伟大的无产阶级革命家的气魄和胆略，亲自发动和领导了这场震撼世界的无产阶级文化大革命。这是在无产阶级专政的国家内，由无产阶级自己发动的第一次大革命。
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您天才地、创造性地、划时代地发展了马克思列宁主义，开辟了国际共产主义运动的新纪元。有了您，世界革命前程似锦，有了您，人类前途灿烂辉煌。我们各族人民生活在伟大的毛泽东思想的新时代，感到无比的自豪和骄傲！
    我们无产阶级革命派，按照您的在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针、政策，遵照您的“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，紧跟您的伟大战略部署，高举革命造反有理的大旗，向资产阶级司令部猛冲猛杀，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫在内蒙古的代理人——一小撮反革命修正主义、民族分裂主义分子，粉碎了他们复辟资本主义、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的罪恶阴谋，斩断了中国赫鲁晓夫伸向内蒙古的黑手。这一仗打得好，打得就是好！挖掉了埋在祖国北方的一颗大“定时炸弹”，铲除了各族人民的一个大隐患，狠狠地揍了帝修反当头一棒！
    “一月革命”风暴席卷全国。正当无产阶级革命派乘胜追击的关键时刻，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派恶狠狠地跳了出来，网罗社会上的牛鬼蛇神，以十倍的疯狂，百倍的仇恨，向无产阶级革命派进行猖狂的反扑。在这严重的时刻，我们能退却吗？不能！绝对不能！历史的车轮岂能倒转！我们无产阶级革命派顶阴风，战恶浪，击退了资本主义反革命复辟逆流，经受了严峻的考验。
    革命尤知北京近，造反倍觉您老人家亲。毛主席啊，毛主席！在一场场惊涛骇浪的殊死搏斗中，在那乌云滚滚的日子里，又是您伟大的思想，给了我们无穷无尽的力量。我们饱含着热泪，无限深情地一、遍又一遍地唱着：“抬头望见北斗星，心中想念毛泽东”。想起您，我们心红眼亮方向明；想起您，我们志坚胆壮骨头硬。在我们无产阶级革命派被围困、遭迫害的日日夜夜里，我们手捧您的红书，一次又一次地高声朗读着“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，用鲜血和生命保卫您的革命路线，保卫您光焰无际的伟大思想。
    巍巍大青山，莽莽兴安岭，滚滚黄河水，绵绵绿草原，哪一处不激荡着革命的风暴！哪一处不翻卷着斗争的激流！哪一处没有气壮山河的战斗呼喊！哪一处没有惊心动魄的激烈搏斗！
    千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云。四月十三日，就在这一天，您老人家亲自批准的《中共中央关于处理内蒙问题的决定》公布了！它象一声春雷，驱散了一时笼罩在内蒙古上空的乌云；它象一盏明灯，照亮了内蒙古文化大革命前进的航程。在那最困难的日子里，您亲手缔造的中国人民解放军，最及时、最坚决地支持我们，给了我们巨大的鼓舞和力量。内蒙古的无产阶级文化大革命，沿着您所指引的航向，从一个胜利走向一个胜利。当前形势比任何时候都好。从工厂、商店到机关学校，从城市到农村牧区，从十几岁的娃娃到白发苍苍的老人，人人关心国家大事。人民群众从来没有发动得象今天这么广泛深入。您光辉的思想，从来没有象现在这样深入人心。人们的精神面貌，从来没有象今天这样意气风发。各族人民，从来没有象现在这样亲密团结。我们的无产阶级专政，从来没有象今天这样巩固强大。
    毛主席啊，毛主席！这一切一切，都凝结着您老人家为内蒙古无产阶级文化大革命日夜操劳的心血，就是草原上最好的歌手，拉起最动听的马头琴，唱起千万支最美好的赞歌，也表达不尽我们对您老人家的无限热爱、无限崇敬的心情。
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“中国的革命是伟大的，但革命以后的路程更长，工作更伟大，更艰苦。”我们在您的光辉思想照耀下，从内蒙古党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的手中夺回了大权，“这只是万里长征走完了第一步”。您老人家为我们撑腰，我们一定要为您老人家争气。我们一定用您的光辉思想掌好权，用好权，珍惜胜利，巩固胜利，发展胜利！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您最近提出的要斗私，批修的根本方针和一系列最新指示，是您对一年多来无产阶级文化大革命最科学、最完整、最精辟、最透彻的总结，是保证无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的最强大的思想武器。我们一千个拥护，一万个照办，誓当斗私的闯将，批修的先锋。我们永远要活学活用您老人家的伟大著作，永远以您光辉的“老三篇”为座右铭，狠斗“私”字，大立“公”字，在灵魂深处闹革命，克服各种非无产阶级思想，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在“斗私，批修”中为人民立新功。我们要更加广泛、更加深入地开展革命的大批判，集中火力，集中目标，从政治上、思想上、理论上，批倒、批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在内蒙古的代理人，结合搞好本地区、本单位的斗、批、改，巩固和发展革命的大联合和革命的三结合，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您谆谆教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”对于您的这一教导，我们牢记心头，念念不忘。我们一定要全心全意为人民服务，密切联系群众，兢兢业业，勤勤恳恳，永远保持艰苦奋斗的作风，防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，坚持开展批评和自我批评，实现思想革命化，永葆革命的青春。
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您教导我们：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”我们一定要更深入、更广泛、更持久、更热烈地开展“拥军爱民”运动，巩固祖国的统一，增强各民族的团结，加强无产阶级专政，坚决镇压美蒋特务、苏蒙修特务、日本特务，使内蒙古自治区成为祖国北部边疆坚不可摧的反修长城。让国内外的一切阶级敌人，在我们伟大社会主义祖国的铜墙铁壁面前，碰得头破血流！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！我们一定坚决响应您的伟大号召，抓革命、促生产、促工作、促战备，把各方面的工作做得好上加好！
    最最敬爱的毛主席！您是我们伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手。我们庄严地向您宣誓：我们永远无限忠于您，无限忠于您的光辉思想，无限忠于以您为代表的无产阶级革命路线，永远紧跟着您在大风大浪里奋勇前进！我们一定要用您的光辉思想来统帅一切，改造一切，推动一切。我们要把活学活用您的伟大著作看得高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切，在一切领域里进一步树立起您的绝对权威，进一步树立起您光辉思想的绝对权威，把您光辉思想的伟大红旗，插遍内蒙古的每一寸土地，把内蒙古办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校！
    最最衷心地祝愿您，我们心中最红最红的红太阳，各族人民的大救星，万寿无疆！万寿无疆！万寿无疆！
                      内蒙古自治区革命委员会成立和庆祝大会
                                      一九六七年十一月一日
