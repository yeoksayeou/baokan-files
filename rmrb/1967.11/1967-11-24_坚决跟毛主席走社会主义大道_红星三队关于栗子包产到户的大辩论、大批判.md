Red Star Brigade Three's Great Debate and Criticism of Chestnut Production to Households

The Red Star Brigade in the suburbs of Dandong City, Liaoning Province, is known as the "chestnut hometown." Chestnut groves are everywhere on the hills and ridges. Due to the poisoning of the Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract," many production brigades would contract chestnut production to households during the chestnut harvest season each year.

In the current high tide of revolutionary criticism, the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed in the area seized this representative issue and launched a great debate and criticism of Chinese Khrushchev among the cadres and members of Brigade Three of the Red Star Brigade.

The Issue Raised

During the study of the autumn harvest production plan, some members of Brigade Three suggested: "This year, the brigade's chestnuts should still be divided into sections for estimation and contracted to households for picking." Their reasoning was: "All labor can participate in collective labor without the need to assign someone to guard the chestnuts. The brigade can have fewer worries and troubles, and can also reduce some work points for the members. They said, 'Contracting chestnut production to households, families will carefully guard them, reduce losses, and can pick four or five thousand jin of chestnuts. If picked collectively, at most only one or two thousand jin can be picked.'"

Militia squad leader Liang Manguai and a few poor and lower-middle peasants immediately stood up and expressed their firm opposition. They angrily said, "The 'three freedoms and one contract' advocated by Chinese Khrushchev has already harmed us enough! We know that 'three freedoms and one contract' is a devil's rope, so why put it around our own necks? We cannot criticize Chinese Khrushchev on one hand and execute his reactionary line on the other."

This issue immediately attracted the attention of the propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army Air Force stationed in the area. They believed that this was a concrete reflection of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in the countryside. Therefore, they, along with the militia cadres, a few poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres, decided to first mobilize the poor and lower-middle peasants, militia, and revolutionary mass organizations to fully and deeply launch a great debate and criticism. They aimed to criticize Chinese Khrushchev deeply, thoroughly, and completely, and to thoroughly eliminate the poison of "three freedoms and one contract." They suggested that the militia squad and the revolutionary mass organizations of this brigade immediately launch a special debate on "contracting chestnut production to households."

Who Benefits from Contracting to Households?

The comrades from the propaganda team and the militia, along with the revolutionary mass organizations, first studied the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, focusing their fire on criticizing Chinese Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies of "three freedoms and one contract."

Liang Manguai said indignantly, "Chinese Khrushchev advocates 'three freedoms and one contract,' and its poison runs deep and has a bad influence in our brigade. In the past, our brigade contracted chestnut production to households using the 'calling' method: a grove of chestnut trees, Zhang San would say, 'It can produce 300 jin, I'll take it!' Li Si would say, 'It can produce 350 jin, I'll take it!' Wang Wu would say, '400 jin, I'll take it!' This way, one person 'calls,' and others gradually raise the bid. What's the difference between this and the bourgeoisie's competitive buying and selling! This is simply auctioning off collective property!"

His words had not yet faded when an old poor peasant rushed to say, "I have suffered enough from contracting chestnut production to households and have been poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev! Two years ago, I contracted a grove of chestnut trees. Due to the lack of manpower at home, I couldn't guard it properly, and many were lost. In the autumn, I owed the brigade more than 100 jin of chestnuts, not only did I work for nothing, but I was also fined more than 20 yuan. However, the landlords, rich peasants, and households with more labor power said that contracting chestnut production to households was good. They have more manpower, can guard it, and not only do they not count the thatched grass in the chestnut grove, but they also pick an additional 400 to 500 jin of chestnuts each year, earning an extra 100 to 200 yuan. So, the 'calling' target is high, and we poor households dare not contract. Their voices are loud, the targets are high, year after year they contract, year after year they profit, and their lives get better and better. Who welcomes it, who opposes it, who benefits, and who serves, isn't this very clear? Chinese Khrushchev is against us poor and lower-middle peasants and is on the same side as the landlords and rich peasants!"

Militia political officer Li Rensheng continued, "Our brigade's chestnuts can produce more than 4,000 jin each year, of which more than 1,000 jin are given as overproduction to the contracting households, resulting in the brigade only collecting about 3,000 jin. The contracting households keep the good chestnuts and hand in the inferior ones to the production brigade. They also sell their own chestnuts in the black market at high prices. This way, the collective gets fewer chestnuts, the grade is lower, the income is reduced, and the income of the poor households is also reduced, harming the collective and the poor households. The state collects less, and more goes to the black market, harming the state and causing capitalist tendencies to spread."

The militia members and the revolutionary mass organizations present were extremely angry and said, "Chinese Khrushchev advocates 'three freedoms and one contract,' isn't he trying to cause polarization in the countryside, destroy the people's communes, destroy socialist construction, and restore capitalism?! The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: 'Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose.' We firmly oppose 'three freedoms and one contract' and firmly oppose contracting chestnut production to households!"

The Struggle Continues

The great leader Chairman Mao said, "The struggle between socialism and capitalism in our country in the ideological realm as to who will win and who will lose will take a fairly long time to resolve... If one does not have a sufficient understanding of this situation or does not recognize it at all, then one will commit a great error and will neglect the necessary ideological struggle."

The comrades from the propaganda team, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching, discussed with the revolutionary cadres and convened a meeting of the members to further launch a great debate and criticism.

Through the great debate, some members who advocated contracting chestnut production to households suddenly woke up and said, "In the past, my selfishness was too heavy, I was poisoned by 'three freedoms and one contract,' and unconsciously followed Chinese Khrushchev down the wrong path. Today I understand! I will settle accounts with Chinese Khrushchev! I will definitely study Chairman Mao's works diligently, break down the 'self' and establish the 'public,' thoroughly eliminate the poison of Chinese Khrushchev, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!"

This great debate and criticism gave the vast majority of members a profound class education, raised their consciousness, and clarified the direction.

Next, the comrades from the propaganda team convened meetings for housewives and children, launching a more in-depth and extensive criticism of Chinese Khrushchev's "three freedoms and one contract," educating, guiding, and organizing them to study the "Three Old Articles," "Criticize and Transform Oneself," and establish a revolutionary spirit of wholeheartedly serving the public and the collective. Women and children expressed: We will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, be "selfless and dedicated to others," and will not go up the mountain to pick the collective's chestnuts. We will also help the production brigade guard them well.

However, a few members still had not come around. The comrades from the propaganda team had many heart-to-heart talks with them, studied Chairman Mao's works, recalled the bitterness of the old society, talked about the sweetness of the new society, exposed and criticized the heinous crimes of Chinese Khrushchev, and conducted meticulous ideological education for them. Under the help and education of the comrades from the propaganda team, they finally woke up. Some members excitedly said, "For many years, I was poisoned by Chinese Khrushchev, forgot my roots, and I am ungrateful to Chairman Mao!" He angrily denounced, "Chinese Khrushchev has harmed people too deeply! He is more vicious than a wolf and more poisonous than a scorpion, and is our poor and lower-middle peasants' sworn enemy! We will not rest until we thoroughly criticize and expose him!" He firmly declared: He will definitely educate his wife and children, actively participate in the revolutionary criticism, study Chairman Mao's works diligently, break down the 'self' and establish the 'public,' and forever follow Chairman Mao in revolution!

A Great Harvest of Chestnuts, an Even Greater Harvest of Thought

Through the great debate between the two roads and the criticism of Chinese Khrushchev, the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia members, and revolutionary cadres of Brigade Three have an even deeper love for the great leader Chairman Mao and an even greater hatred for Chinese Khrushchev. They unanimously declared: Chinese Khrushchev advocates "three freedoms and one contract," spreads the single farming wind, attempts to destroy the people's communes, restore capitalism, and wants to pull us back, let us suffer a second disaster, and endure a second round of suffering. We will not agree! We have only one heart: forever read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and forever follow Chairman Mao on the bright socialist road!

Members, with their class consciousness raised, actively helped the brigade guard the chestnuts. As a result, this brigade harvested more than 4,000 jin of chestnuts this year. The ironclad fact shows that collective picking is good, very good. The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants, militia members, and revolutionary cadres joyfully said: This year, the chestnuts had a great harvest, and people's thoughts had an even greater harvest. This is all thanks to the great leader Chairman Mao, all thanks to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, all thanks to the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat, and all thanks to the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the People's Liberation Army!

    坚决跟毛主席走社会主义大道
    ——红星三队关于栗子包产到户的大辩论、大批判
    红卫东
    辽宁省丹东市郊区红星公社是“板栗之乡”。这里山坡、岭上，到处都是密密麻麻的栗子林。由于受到中国赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”的毒害，每年栗子成熟时节，许多生产队便把栗子包产到户。
    在当前革命的大批判高潮中，驻军空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，抓住这个具有代表性的问题，在红星大队第三生产队干部和社员中，开展了一场两条道路的大辩论和对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判。
    问题的提出
    在研究秋收生产计划时，红星三队有的社员主张：今年队里的栗子，仍然应该分片估产，包给社员家拣。他们的理由是：所有劳动力都可以参加集体劳动，不用单独抽人去看管。队里可少操心，少麻烦，还可以少给社员一部分工分。他们说什么“栗子包产到户，社员家经心看管，减少丢失，能拣四、五千斤栗子，如果集体拣，最多只能拣一、两千斤。”
    民兵排长梁满贵和几个贫下中农立刻站起来，表示坚决反对。他们愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的‘三自一包’，已经害得我们够呛的了！我们明知‘三自一包’是根鬼锁绳，为啥偏往自己的脖子上套？我们不能一边批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，一边执行他的反动路线。”
    这个问题，立即引起驻军空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队的重视。他们认为，这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争在农村中的具体反映。因此，他们和民兵干部、几个贫下中农、革命干部研究确定，首先发挥贫下中农、民兵和革命群众组织的战斗作用，全面地深入地开展一场大辩论、大批判，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国赫鲁晓夫批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清“三自一包”的流毒。于是，他们建议民兵排和这个队的革命群众组织，立刻开展“栗子包产到户”专题辩论。
    包产到户对谁有利？
    宣传队同志和民兵们及革命群众组织的同志们，首先学习了伟大领袖毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，集中火力批判了中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”的反动谬论。
    梁满贵义愤填膺地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘三自一包’，在咱们队流毒极深，影响极坏。往年，咱们队栗子包产到户，采取‘叫行’的方式：一片栗子林，张三说：‘可产三百斤，我包！’李四说：‘可产三百五，我包！’王五说：‘四百，我包！’这样一人‘叫行’，别人逐步加码。这和资产阶级的买卖竞争有什么两样！这简直是拿着集体财产进行大拍卖！”
    他的话音未落，一个老贫农便抢着说：“我算吃尽了栗子包产到户的苦头，受尽了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒害！前年我包了一片栗子林，由于家里人手少，看管不过来，丢失了不少，秋后倒欠队里一百多斤栗子，不仅白搭了工，还被罚款二十多元。但是，地主、富农和劳力多的富裕户却说栗子包产到户好。人家人手多，看管得了，割了栗子林中的苫房草不算，每年拣栗子还多拣四五百斤，多赚百八十元。所以‘叫行’指标高，咱们贫困户不敢包。人家嗓门高，指标高，年年包，年年有赚头，日子越过越富裕。栗子包产到户，谁欢迎，谁反对，对谁有利，为谁服务，这不是很清楚了吗？中国赫鲁晓夫就是和咱们贫下中农作对，和地主、富农一鼻孔出气！”
    民兵政治干事李仁生接着说：“咱们队的栗子，每年可收四千多斤，其中一千多斤作为超产给了包产户，结果队里只收得三千来斤。包产户把好栗子留下，把差的上缴给生产队，又把自己手中的栗子拿到黑市场，高价出售。这样，集体得的栗子少了，等级低了，收入减少了，贫困户的收入也随之减少，害了集体，害了贫困户。国家收的少了，上黑市的多了，又害了国家，造成资本主义泛滥。”
    到会的民兵和革命群众组织的同志们无比愤怒地说：“中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹‘三自一包’，不是企图造成农村两极分化，破坏人民公社，破坏社会主义建设，复辟资本主义，又是什么？！伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：‘凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。’我们坚决反对‘三自一包’，坚决反对栗子包产到户！”
    斗争在继续
    伟大领袖毛主席说：“我国社会主义和资本主义之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负的斗争，还需要一个相当长的时间才能解决。……如果对于这种形势认识不足，或者根本不认识，那就要犯绝大的错误，就会忽视必要的思想斗争。”
    宣传队的同志按照毛主席这一伟大教导，又同革命干部商量，召开了社员大会，进一步开展了大辩论、大批判。
    通过大辩论，有的主张栗子包产到户的社员，猛然醒悟地说：“过去，我的私心太重，中了‘三自一包’的毒，不自觉地跟中国赫鲁晓夫走上了邪道。今天我算明白了！我要向中国赫鲁晓夫进行清算！我一定好好活学活用毛主席著作，大破‘私’字，大立‘公’字，彻底肃清中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”
    这场大辩论、大批判，使绝大多数社员受到了一次深刻的阶级教育，提高了觉悟，明确了方向。
    接着，宣传队同志又召开家庭妇女会、儿童会，对中国赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”，开展了更深入更广泛的大批判，教育、引导和组织他们学习“老三篇”，“斗私，批修”，树立一心为公，一心为集体的革命思想。妇女、儿童纷纷表示：我们一定听毛主席的话，做“毫不利己专门利人”的人，决不上山拣集体的栗子，还要帮助生产队看管好。
    但是，个别社员仍然思想不通。宣传队同志便多次同他们促膝谈心，学习毛主席著作，忆旧社会的苦，讲新社会的甜，揭露和批判中国赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行，对他们进行细致的思想教育。在宣传队同志的帮助教育下，他们终于觉悟过来了。有的社员激动地说：“多年来，我中了中国赫鲁晓夫的毒，忘了本，我对不起毛主席！”他愤怒地斥责：“中国赫鲁晓夫害人太深了！他比豺狼还狠，比蝎子还毒，是我们贫下中农的死对头！不把他彻底批倒斗臭，决不罢休！”他坚决表示：一定要教育妻子和孩子，积极参加革命的大批判，活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，永远跟毛主席闹革命！
    栗子大丰收，思想更大丰收
    通过两条道路的大辩论和对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判，红星三队广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，对伟大领袖毛主席更加热爱，对中国赫鲁晓夫更加仇恨。他们一致表示：中国赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮单干风，企图破坏人民公社，复辟资本主义，想拉我们走回头路，让我们遭第二茬灾，受第二遍苦。我们坚决不答应！我们就是一个心眼：永远读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，永远跟毛主席走社会主义光明大道！
    社员由于阶级觉悟提高了，大家主动帮助队里看管栗子。结果，这个队今年收了四千多斤栗子。铁的事实表明，集体拣就是好，好得很。广大贫下中农、民兵和革命干部，欢天喜地地说：今年栗子大丰收，人的思想更大丰收，这都全靠着伟大领袖毛主席，全靠着战无不胜的毛泽东思想，全靠着无产阶级文化大革命，全靠着解放军毛泽东思想宣传队！
