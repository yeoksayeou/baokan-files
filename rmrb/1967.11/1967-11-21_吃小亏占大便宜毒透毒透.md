	Mao Zedong Quotations
	Serve the people wholeheartedly, ...
	Our army is one of the people. It is founded to liberate the people. It is absolutely for the people's interests.
	The Chinese Khrushchev's nonsense: Taking small advantages and suffering big losses, suffering small losses to gain big advantages, this is in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview.

	Taking Small Losses to Gain Big Advantages is Poisonous
	Active Learner of Chairman Mao's Works, Ninth Production Brigade Accountant Cao Peiying

	The so-called "old revolutionary" who is actually an old counter-revolutionary, the Chinese Khrushchev, says that "taking small losses to gain big advantages" is "in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview." This is sheer nonsense.

	First, let us expose his fox's skin and see what "taking small losses to gain big advantages" really is. Before liberation, the landlords and rich peasants in our area chanted the mantra of "taking small losses to gain big advantages" day and night. They said, "Small money doesn't go, big money doesn't come"; they said, "Do good in spring and reap in summer"; they also said, "Use a small fish to catch a big fish, use a small investment to seek big profits," and so on. Whenever there was a shortage of food or a natural disaster, they would seize the opportunity to use "small fish" to catch "big fish" from the laboring people, using small money to gain big profits; or during the busy season, they would use "small fish" as small favors to deceive and increase the exploitation of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Chinese Khrushchev actually praises this trash of the landlord exploiting class as "in accordance with the Marxist-Leninist proletarian worldview," truly shameless. The Chinese Khrushchev is indeed the representative of the ideology of the exploiting classes of China for thousands of years, a faithful spokesman for the landlord and bourgeoisie.

	The essence of "taking small losses to gain big advantages" is the character "self." "Taking small losses" is for the sake of "gaining big advantages," one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, the abacus calculates in but not out. Everything starts from "self," plans for "self." The Chinese Khrushchev wants to use this extreme selfishness of the exploiting class to corrupt people's souls, in order to restore capitalism, truly poisonous! A few years ago, during the period of temporary national difficulties, some people in our brigade, poisoned by the stink of the idea of "taking small losses to gain big advantages," for the sake of personal or small group interests, also used "small fish" to catch "big fish," not hesitating to use backdoor methods to harm the interests of the state and the collective, causing themselves to fall into the capitalist quagmire. A person, if the abacus in their heart is always calculating for "self," the more they calculate for "self," the more "self" there will be, they will sink deeper and deeper into the capitalist quagmire. If this develops, the individual will degenerate, the country will change color, and it will lead to the downfall of the nation, the party, and the head. At that time, the only ones who can "gain big advantages" will be the landlords, rich peasants, and their chief backer, the Chinese Khrushchev, and the laboring people will suffer twice, living a life worse than cattle and horses.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us to always think of the revolution and the people; while the Chinese Khrushchev wants us to "take small losses to gain big advantages," always thinking of ourselves. This is a fundamental opposition between two worldviews, and it is a big issue of which road we young people will take and which class's successor we will become. We are young people growing up in the Mao Zedong era. We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, to "serve the people wholeheartedly," always "put revolutionary interests first and personal interests second," arm ourselves with great Mao Zedong Thought, continually "struggle against selfishness" and "criticize revisionism," strive to do well in the revolutionary work we are responsible for, and cultivate ourselves into reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause, so that our great socialist motherland will remain red forever!

    毛主席语录
    全心全意地为人民服务，……
    我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。
    中国赫鲁晓夫黑话：占小便宜，吃大亏，吃点小亏，占大便宜，这是合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的。
    吃小亏占大便宜毒透毒透

    自称“老革命”实为老反革命的中国赫鲁晓夫，说什么“吃小亏占大便宜”是“合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的”，真是闭着眼睛说瞎话。
    首先让我们剥开他狐狸皮来看一看“吃小亏占大便宜”到底是啥货色。解放前，我们这里的地主、富农，一天到夜念的就是“吃小亏占大便宜”的生意经。他们说：“小钱不去，大钱不来”；他们说：“行得春风夏雨落”；他们还说：“川条（小鱼）钓白鱼（大鱼），小本求大利”等等。每当青黄不接，或者遇到天灾人祸，他们就乘此机会，以“川条”在劳动人民身上钓“白鱼”，以小钱得大利；或者在大忙季节，以“川条”作为小恩小惠进行欺骗，加重对贫下中农的剥削。中国赫鲁晓夫竟把这种地主剥削阶级的破烂货，吹捧为是“合乎马列主义无产阶级世界观的”，真是不要面孔。中国赫鲁晓夫正是中国几千年来剥削阶级意识形态的总代表，是道道地地的地主资产阶级的忠实代言人。
    “吃小亏占大便宜”的实质就是个“私”字。“吃小亏”，是为了“占大便宜”，一二三四五六七，算盘打进不打出。一切从“私”出发，为“私”打算。中国赫鲁晓夫就是要用这种剥削阶级的极端利己主义，来腐蚀人们的灵魂，以便复辟资本主义，真是毒透毒透！前几年国家暂时困难时期，我们大队有的人由于中了“吃小亏占大便宜”这个臭思想的毒，为了个人或小集体的利益，也用“川条”去钓“白鱼”，不惜用开后门的办法去损害国家和大集体的利益，使自己跌进资本主义泥坑。一个人，如果心里的算盘尽往“私”字上打，越打“私”字越多，就会在资本主义泥坑里越陷越深。发展下去，个人要变质，国家要变色，就要亡国、亡党、亡头。那时，能够“占大便宜”的只能是地主、富农和他们的总后台中国赫鲁晓夫，劳动人民就会吃二遍苦，又要过牛马不如的生活。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们要处处为了革命，时时想到人民；而中国赫鲁晓夫却要我们“吃小亏占大便宜”，处处为了活命，时时想到个人。这是两种世界观的根本对立，也是关系到我们青年走什么道路，把自己培养成哪一个阶级的接班人的大问题。我们是生长在毛泽东时代的青年，一定要听毛主席的话，遵照毛主席的伟大教导，要“全心全意地为人民服务”，处处“以革命利益为第一生命，以个人利益服从革命利益”，以伟大的毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断“斗私”，彻底“批修”，努力做好本身所担负的革命工作，把自己培养成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人，使我们伟大祖国的社会主义江山千秋万代永不变色！
