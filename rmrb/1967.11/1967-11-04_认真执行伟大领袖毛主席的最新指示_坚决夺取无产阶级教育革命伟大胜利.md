We must follow their path of thorough revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students at Kunming Institute of Technology, who have resumed classes and made revolution, also expressed their determination to combine the study of the preliminary plans of brother institutions on education revolution with the specific conditions of their own school, dare to practice, and propose their own educational reform plans. Revolutionary teachers and students at Henan Agricultural College said in a discussion that the time when the revolutionary masses rise up to carry out the education revolution is the time when the bourgeois education system perishes. We must advance bravely along the course charted by Chairman Mao, unswervingly.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the proletarian education revolution have also sparked excitement in primary and secondary schools across the country. Many primary and secondary schools that have resumed classes and made revolution have listened to the radio repeatedly from last night to this morning, studying and discussing seriously. Everyone excitedly said: Chairman Mao trusts the masses the most and has entrusted the heavy responsibility of the education revolution to us proletarian revolutionaries. This is a great trust in us. We must resolutely set ambitious goals and make great vows to contribute all our strength to completing the great task of the proletarian education revolution. Revolutionary youngsters at Jinan No. 18 Middle School said, we must learn from the proletarian revolutionaries at Shanghai Tongji University, Beijing Forestry University, and Beijing Normal University, learn from their revolutionary spirit of smashing the bourgeois and revisionist education systems, and be vanguards and pioneers in the great proletarian education revolution.

Chairman Mao's latest instructions have ignited the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff across the country.
