Edition: 6

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out at the Eighth Central Committee's Tenth Plenum: "Using novels to engage in anti-party activities is a great invention." The Chinese Khrushchev's agent, the anti-party conspirator Peng Dehuai, is precisely the kind of anti-party "great inventor" that Chairman Mao severely criticized. For a long time, while he was busily seizing the gun, he also fiercely seized the pen. To create public opinion for his own usurpation of the party and the military, he bought some anti-party literati and, through various forms of art, distorted history and erected monuments for himself. The anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an" is a particularly prominent example of this.

"Defending Yan'an" was created under Peng Dehuai's personal planning and support. In the autumn of 1948, the ambitious anti-party conspirator Peng Dehuai received the author of this black book and praised his battlefield dispatches, which directly or indirectly flattered Peng Dehuai, and then asked him to "reflect well on the situation of the liberation war in the Northwest battlefield through literary works." The master's favor and recognition, the servant understood. After "receiving the personal instructions of Comrade Peng," the author of this black book "made up his mind, regardless of his ability, to write a book" to let people "pay homage" to this anti-party ambitious man. During the writing process of the novel, Peng Dehuai and his close associates provided various conveniences for the author. After the novel was published, Peng Dehuai specially summoned the author of the novel and gave him a warm reception, praising his "success" in the literary field. From this, one can see how much this anti-party ambitious man valued the role of this big poisonous weed in preparing public opinion for his usurpation of the party and the military!

Inverting history, stealing credit from heaven

1947 was a great turning point in the history of the Chinese revolution. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, that year, the people's liberation war achieved a great victory of historic significance. Especially on the Northwest battlefield, Chairman Mao personally commanded the people of Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to smash the enemy's concentrated attack of more than twenty thousand troops, thus turning our army into a nationwide offensive. The anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an," however, maliciously distorts this piece of history, erasing the role of the great commander Chairman Mao and the invincible might of Mao Zedong's military thought, shamelessly beautifying and praising the anti-party veteran Peng Dehuai, and striving to gain anti-party political capital for him. This clearly exposes the criminal purpose of the novel's author and the wolfish ambition of Peng Dehuai and his gang to usurp the party and the military.

In the novel "Defending Yan'an," the author uses all his flattering skills to praise Peng Dehuai, this great ambitious man, great conspirator, and great warlord, as a "great military strategist," "genius military strategist," "commander of the Northwest battlefield," and "a person forged from will and strength." He attributes the victories of the battles of Qinghuaping, Yangmahao, Panlong Town, and Shahejiao to him, and attributes all the great achievements of defending the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region to him, saying things like: "Comrade Peng commanded the troops to win several consecutive victories," "Comrade Peng led the enemy here and dragged them there until the enemy was almost dead, and then fiercely pounced on them, wiping out the enemy in one net," "everything was within Comrade Peng's expectations," and even describing Peng Dehuai as a remarkable person who is "good at turning around all crisis situations in difficult and dire times."

History cannot be inverted! The famous Yan'an Defense Battle was personally planned and directly commanded by our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao. Peng Dehuai did not "turn around all crisis situations in difficult and dire times," but instead, every time he stood on the side of opportunism to exacerbate the "crisis situation." When Chiang Kai-shek and Hu Zongnan were madly attacking Yan'an with heavy troops, it was this Peng Dehuai, who advocated "repelling the enemy at the national gate" during the Second Revolutionary Civil War, who again proposed the "leftist" opportunist idea of "cutting off the enemy's claws at the gate of Yan'an." At this critical moment, it was our great leader Chairman Mao who made the extremely wise decision. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, in the face of the disparity in troops, we could not engage in a direct confrontation with the enemy but should use our army's favorable conditions to lure the enemy deep into the enemy's territory, adopt the "mushroom" tactic, and annihilate the enemy after exhausting them. Before our army withdrew from Yan'an, Chairman Mao had already arranged for our army to lure the enemy's main force to the Anse direction with a small unit, while our main force ambushed the enemy's flank at Qinghuaping. As a result, on the sixth day after leaving Yan'an, we annihilated the enemy's 31st Brigade. Peng Dehuai, this unlearned warlord, could not understand Chairman Mao's great strategic thought at all. After the victory at Qinghuaping, he did not want to continue to engage with the enemy, jumped out to oppose Chairman Mao's "mushroom" tactic, and wanted our army to immediately go north to attack Yulin or go south to attack the enemy's rear, eager to engage in a decisive battle with the enemy. Chairman Mao immediately replied by telegram, criticizing Peng Dehuai's military adventurism and instructing our army to continue to adopt the original method, engage with the enemy in the current area for a period, make the enemy reach a state of extreme fatigue and extreme shortage of supplies, and then seek an opportunity to annihilate them. It was under Chairman Mao's personal planning and command, according to Chairman Mao's correct policy, that our army won two more very brilliant victories at Yangmahao and Panlong Town.

In these battles, Peng Dehuai arbitrarily violated Chairman Mao's instructions, causing the battle to be on the verge of failure. Take the battle of Panlong Town, for example. When the enemy inside the town was stubbornly resisting with their strong fortifications and fierce artillery fire, and a small part of the enemy reinforcements were gradually approaching, Peng Dehuai, as the front-line commander, actually wavered and became afraid, wanting to turn around and leave, almost making our army's efforts in vain. At this critical moment, Chairman Mao issued a battle order to the broad masses of cadres and soldiers to persist, and finally captured Panlong Town, annihilating more than seven thousand of Hu Zongnan's elite troops, the Li Kunang unit, and also obtaining a large amount of supplies. Just like the previous battles of Qinghuaping and Yangmahao, the victory at Panlong Town was also achieved by overcoming Peng Dehuai's wrong commands. As for the battle of Shahejiao, which became the turning point of the Northwest battlefield, it was personally commanded by Chairman Mao. Before the battle, Chairman Mao directly convened a battle meeting and formulated the battle plan; after the battle began, Chairman Mao stayed up all night, personally commanding the battle by telephone. To lure the enemy northward, Chairman Mao, starting from the attack on Yulin, personally led several hundred cadres and guards to engage with more than fifty thousand Kuomintang troops and finally lured the enemy to the predetermined battle area—the northeast of Shahejiao on the Yellow River, ensuring the victory of the battle. This showed our great leader's unique courage of having "a hundred million soldiers in his heart." While Peng Dehuai, not only did he not correctly execute Chairman Mao's strategic instructions of feigning an attack on Yulin in the first phase of the Shahejiao battle, but after the Shahejiao battle, he also, without Chairman Mao's knowledge, decided to attack Yulin again, causing our army unnecessary losses and committing an unforgivable crime. Living historical facts have repeatedly and mercilessly exposed the lies of Peng Dehuai and his cronies boasting about being a "genius military strategist."

The entire victory of the Yan'an Defense Battle was completely the victory of Chairman Mao's wise command, the victory of the brilliant theory and practice of people's war led by Chairman Mao, and the brilliant victory of Mao Zedong's military thought over Peng Dehuai's opportunist military line and bourgeois military thought!

The anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an" distorts history, inverts black and white, erases the struggle between Chairman Mao's revolutionary military line and Peng Dehuai's opportunist line, does not mention Peng Dehuai's mistakes and crimes at all, but instead beautifies and praises him in every possible way, even changing the victory of the Yan'an Defense Battle, which was personally commanded by Chairman Mao, into Peng Dehuai's achievements, transplanting Chairman Mao's brilliant strategic thoughts onto Peng Dehuai, attempting to make him a Buddha, which is extremely shameless. This is a great conspiracy planned by the ambitious man Peng Dehuai to create public opinion for usurping the party and the military, a great deception to deceive the world and steal fame!

Maliciously Slandering Our Great Leader

In 1952, when Peng Dehuai "received" the anti-party film script "Defending Yan'an," he said: "The Central Committee stayed in Shaanbei to attract the enemy." This remark fully exposed this great conspirator's anti-party ambition. He had long regarded the victory of the Shaanbei liberation war as his own "merit," fundamentally denying the great significance of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao staying in Shaanbei. The anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an" is very much in line with Peng Dehuai's "intentions." The book, from beginning to end, does not mention Chairman Mao's wise guidance of the nationwide liberation war at this important historical juncture, nor does it mention Chairman Mao's great encouragement to the masses by staying in Shaanbei to command the people to fight together. Instead, it deliberately emphasizes and exaggerates the fact that our great leader is being protected by others. In Chapter 6, "Shahejiao," the author, on the one hand, enthusiastically praises how Peng Dehuai bravely enters the gunfire and personally commands the frontline battlefield; on the other hand, as a contrast, he carefully arranges a scene where, at this critical moment of decisive battle and when our troops are insufficient, the column's guard company is still sent to protect Chairman Mao. The author uses this despicable means to portray Chairman Mao and the Central Committee as a big burden on the Northwest battlefield and to praise Peng Dehuai to the heavens.

The author of the novel, in order to achieve the evil purpose of belittling Chairman Mao and elevating Peng Dehuai, fabricated history and fabricated lies without scruples. At the beginning of the novel, it describes that on the night our army withdrew from Yan'an, the enemy had already entered the southern suburbs of the city, and many people who were waiting for the order to leave were constantly looking at the light in a cave on the half-mountain of Wangjiaping. It was said that Peng Dehuai and the commanders were still studying the battle deployment there. At the same time, the novel uses a dark and low tone to describe Chairman Mao, under the protection of the "fighting troops," quietly leaving Yan'an from the side of Zao Yuan Village. After such a contrast, the author wrote in the mouth of our army's cadres and soldiers: "The enemy may arrive in Yan'an at dawn, but Comrade Peng, the Vice Commander-in-Chief, is still here!" And "our Central Committee and Chairman Mao have probably retreated to some place north of Yan'an!" One praise and one criticism, how clear! The author's evil intention here is to attempt to beautify Peng Dehuai, this clown, as the "commander" who bears the heavy responsibility of the Chinese revolution, as the great person who turns around the situation; while our great leader Chairman Mao, who was actually planning the battle on the eve of the battle, is instead regarded as an unimportant person. How evil their intentions are!

In fact, before our army withdrew from Yan'an, the light that never went out and illuminated the whole country in Wangjiaping was not Peng Dehuai's, but our most beloved leader Chairman Mao's. From the eve of Chiang Kai-shek's launching of the civil war in 1946, Chairman Mao, in order to effectively direct the situation, specially moved from Zao Yuan to the People's Liberation Army General Headquarters in Wangjiaping to live. During the period when the Hu Zongnan gang attacked Yan'an, Chairman Mao, despite the savage bombing by enemy planes, personally deployed and commanded the seven-day and seven-night battle of resistance in Wangjiaping, annihilating a large number of enemies and shattering the dream of "capturing Yan'an in three days" of the Chiang-Hu gang. On March 16, after the enemy paid a huge price, they reached the vicinity of Jinpenwan and Nanluwan, approaching the gate of Yan'an. However, Wangjiaping was still brightly lit all night, and our beloved leader was calm and composed, continuing to command the nationwide and Northwest battlefield people's liberation war for the Chinese people day and night. It was not until the evening of March 18 that the enemy rushed to the suburbs of Yan'an, and the sound of gunfire could be heard clearly, that Chairman Mao and the comrades of the Central Committee left Yan'an. The authors of the novel are audacious, using the method of changing heaven and earth, distorting historical facts, belittling our leader Chairman Mao's great historical role, their reactionary faces are not obvious?

Even more intolerable is that the novel writes black words, directly attacking our great leader Chairman Mao. For example, the book writes a conversation between the platoon leader Zhou Daoyong and the old man Li Zhende. Old man Li said: "Our Chairman Mao can tell the enemy's intentions with a calculation," "wherever Chairman Mao draws a circle, the enemy will be unlucky there." This is the most sincere feeling of the people of Shaanbei's unlimited faith in Chairman Mao, but the author is very displeased with this, and he said coldly through Zhou Daoyong's mouth: "There is no such thing," "according to your words, Chairman Mao would become a fairy." He vigorously denied Chairman Mao's wise foresight and brilliant command. This is not enough, the author specially explained to the people through Zhou Daoyong's inner thoughts: "Our army can win the battle because of what kind of military thought." The "what kind of military thought" mentioned here is the "Peng's thought" that the whole book vigorously advocates, which belongs to Peng Dehuai, this so-called "great military strategist." The authors of the novel treat our great leader and his black master with such clear "hatred and love"!

The novel "Defending Yan'an" is thus a big poisonous weed that, in accordance with Peng Dehuai's intentions, shamelessly slanders our great leader Chairman Mao.

An Arrow Poisoned at the People and the Army

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, only the people, are the creators of world history." The authors of "Defending Yan'an," out of their reactionary political purposes, dressed Peng Dehuai up as a "savior," and trampled on the general masses of the border region and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of our army.

The general masses of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region that appear in "Defending Yan'an" are either cowards who are afraid of the Kuomintang's military attacks or pitiful people waiting for Peng Dehuai to send people to save them.

Look, the novel depicts the planned, organized, and orderly evacuation of the people of Yan'an as follows: "The fields are full of broken carts, farming tools, furniture, and clothes, quilts, cotton, which are spitting fire and smoke"; "the shrill screams of women, the crying of children"; "the old people, old and small, are escaping, but where to escape to?" ...

Look, the novel distorts the spiritual state of the people of Yan'an facing the Kuomintang's attack as follows: "The old woman looked at the corpses and injured children on the cart, dazed and lost"; "tens of thousands of old people, women, and children, carrying suffering and the pain of losing their relatives, walked forward. Their heavy feet kicked up dust all over the sky"; "Alas, when will the war end, how will we live in the future?" ...

This is not like the planned retreat of the people of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region during the liberation war under the leadership of the Party! This is not like the heroic people of Yan'an! This is a great distortion of history! This is a great slander of the people!

The people of Shaanbei have long been under the leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, with a high level of political awareness and rich experience in struggle. Under the Party's education, they understand the strategic significance of our army's voluntary abandonment of Yan'an. Facing the attack of the Hu Zongnan gang, the people of Yan'an were calm and composed. With our great leader Chairman Mao fighting alongside them, they felt extremely secure. They were full of confidence in victory, organized themselves, and fortified the walls and cleared the fields, making the enemy unable to eat or drink, leaving only an empty city. In the entire Shaanbei war, they supported the front, guided the way, cooperated with the regular troops in combat, strictly sealed off information, making the enemy empty-handed and beaten everywhere, and made outstanding contributions to the victory of the war. However, the author of "Defending Yan'an," out of his counter-revolutionary political needs, deliberately deviated from this historical truth and created a so-called picture of the people "fleeing," in order to lower the people's masses and contrast and elevate Peng Dehuai's image, making him a "great savior" and "great hero" who saves the people from water and fire. This is the author's evil and despicable intention.

For the same purpose, this anti-party novel also seriously distorts our army's soldiers. The many images of cadres and soldiers described by the author are actually not real proletarian soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought, but so-called "active machines" that "do as Comrade Peng decides, we will do as he says." Their important purpose of being arranged there is to highlight the true central figure of the whole book, Peng Dehuai, like stars surrounding the moon. In addition to the division commander Chen Xingyun frequently flattering Peng Dehuai, the novel describes the battle hero Wang Laohu, after a bloody battle, in a state of unconsciousness, thinking of nothing but himself becoming a battle hero again, vaguely feeling that "Comrade Peng, the Vice Commander-in-Chief, is coming towards him, with a stern and affectionate look in his eyes..." (Look, for the sake of flattering Peng Dehuai, the author has trampled on the hero to what extent!) The division chief of staff Wei Yi, on the battlefield, was also thinking about "Comrade Peng, the Vice Commander-in-Chief, is watching him, demanding that he bring out his greatest loyalty." The quick-tongued singer Li Jianguo repeatedly sang: "Comrade Peng spreads a net all over the sky, captures prisoners and seizes guns." The platoon leader Zhou Daoyong also embodied Peng Dehuai's set of bourgeois goods with his actions, relying solely on military strength and hard fighting. The authors of the novel once solemnly claimed that they wanted to explore "what force makes our war victorious? What force can make those seemingly ordinary people achieve extraordinary heroic deeds?" The answer provided by "Defending Yan'an" is: "great spiritual force" comes from Peng Dehuai. Look, the authors of "Defending Yan'an" are so shameless! They have reached such a crazy level of opposing the Party, the people, and Chairman Mao! Our great People's Liberation Army is a people's army created and led by Chairman Mao, a great army established according to Chairman Mao's military thought. Our great leader Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of our army's cadres and soldiers, and the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought is the spiritual source of our army's invincibility. The authors of "Defending Yan'an," however, attempted to dress up Peng Dehuai's reactionary thoughts as brilliant Mao Zedong Thought, and to praise Peng Dehuai, this clown, as the spiritual source of our broad masses of cadres and soldiers, from which we can fully see this great warlord's political ambition to usurp the Party and the military!

What is even more intolerable is that, in order to cater to Peng Dehuai's wolfish ambition to usurp military power, the novel actually presents our troops and our soldiers as gifts of entry, giving them to this ambitious man, calling them "Comrade Peng's soldiers." This is a sycophantic song for an ambitious and self-satisfied anti-party conspirator. And in this song, our soldiers and revolutionary masses are all treated as sacrifices. We hereby solemnly warn Peng Dehuai and the authors of "Defending Yan'an": Do not slander our soldiers! Our soldiers will always be loyal to the people, loyal to the proletariat, loyal to our great commander Chairman Mao! Rivers will not flow backward, Peng Dehuai wants our soldiers to belong to him personally, this is a foolish dream!

A Representative Work of the Bourgeois Military Line

"Defending Yan'an" directly advocates Peng Dehuai's reactionary bourgeois military line to oppose and replace Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary military line. This is another important aspect of the novel's anti-party crimes.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army, according to Chairman Mao's proletarian military principles, has always advocated emphasizing proletarian politics, using politics to command the military, and putting political work in the first place. Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The Chinese Red Army is a armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks," "the Red Army is not just for fighting," "the Eighth Route Army has something extremely important and extremely conspicuous, that is, its political work." The novel "Defending Yan'an," however, goes against this, vigorously advocating emphasizing military affairs, which is actually advocating the reactionary military line of emphasizing bourgeois politics, and deliberately portraying the Chinese People's Liberation Army that participated in the Shaanbei War as a purely military force that only fights. It not only did not undertake the task of "propagandizing the masses, organizing the masses, and arming the masses," but also did not understand Chairman Mao's great strategic significance of voluntarily abandoning Yan'an at all. When the troops heard the news that our side temporarily withdrew from Yan'an, the cadres and soldiers all cried out in sorrow, shouting wildly: "Fight to the death! Fight to the death!" This is a great mockery of our army's political work!

Chairman Mao, when summarizing the experience of the Northwest liberation war in 1948, pointed out: The reason why the Northwest war achieved a series of victories is multifaceted, "but the most noteworthy is that in the winter of more than two months, the new-style army rectification was carried out using the 'bitterness' and 'three checks' methods." In the article "Democratic Movement within the Army," Chairman Mao also emphasized the importance of the army's "three checks" and "three rectifications," and mentioned that "this military democracy was implemented in the Panlong Battle in Shaanbei and the Shijiazhuang Battle in Jin-Cha-Ji, and achieved great results." However, the novel "Defending Yan'an," which claims to reflect the situation of the Northwest liberation war during this period, did not express the political movements and political work carried out by our army at all. Although the novel used a very limited space to write about Zhou Daoyong's spontaneous "bitterness" scene, its purpose was only to introduce Zhou Daoyong's background, and it was not written as an organized, planned, and led political movement. The political work cadres described in the novel, such as the division political commissar Li Cheng, are actually tools for implementing Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line. What Li Cheng boasts about is purely military technical training. The author's reason for writing about training troops in the intervals of battles is to show that the victories of the battles of Shahejiao and others are not the victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian military line, but the victories of Peng Dehuai's bourgeois military line. Peng Dehuai, in order to change the proletarian nature of our army, has always opposed emphasizing proletarian politics in the army, saying nonsense like: "The excellence of military training results of various levels of cadres and the excellence of military science learning results are the basic standards for determining the high and low of our army's future combat effectiveness." The bourgeois goods advocated by "Defending Yan'an," which fight purely by military means and do not rely on politics, are precisely the big peddlers of Peng Dehuai's reactionary views, serving the purpose of Peng Dehuai's attempt to turn our army into a tool for counter-revolutionary restoration.

Chairman Mao has always placed the people's guerrilla warfare in a very important position in many of his works, pointing out: "From the perspective of the entire revolutionary war, the people's guerrilla warfare and the main force Red Army are like the left and right hands of one person. Only the main force Red Army without the people's guerrilla warfare is like a one-armed general." Chairman Mao has also repeatedly taught us: "The conditions of the people in the base areas, specifically speaking, are the people who have been armed. The enemy regards it as a difficult path, mainly because of this point." Peng Dehuai, this old opportunist, has always opposed Chairman Mao's people's war thought, emphasizing the regular army one-sidedly and deliberately erasing the role of guerrilla units and local armed forces. After the national liberation, Peng Dehuai, with the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, under the pretext of so-called "regularization" and "modernization," fiercely opposed the establishment of militias, opposed the so-called "guerrilla habits," and fiercely promoted the bourgeois military line. The authors of the novel "Defending Yan'an," like their master Peng Dehuai, deliberately belittled the role of the people's guerrilla warfare. Ninety-nine percent of the content of the whole book is about the activities of the regular army, and there is not a trace of the contributions of local armed forces and guerrilla units in the Shaanbei liberation war. The only guerrilla unit mentioned in the book is a group of people who cannot fight and rely entirely on the support of the regular army, and are not the people's heroes who seize weapons from the enemy. The author of the novel attempted to create a false impression through such deliberate descriptions: the victory of the Yan'an Defense Battle is neither the victory of Chairman Mao's people's war thought nor the result of the heroic struggle of the broad masses of Shaanbei people, but only the merits of the regular army commanded by the so-called "commander of the Northwest battlefield" Peng Dehuai. This is not only a distortion of history and a slander of the people, but also the most naked attack on Chairman Mao's proletarian military line!

Smash Peng Dehuai's Black Monument

The anti-party poisonous weed "Defending Yan'an" was published and widely circulated in 1954, which was not accidental. In February 1954, our Party held the Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee, thoroughly exposing the anti-party crimes of Gao Gang and Rao Shushi. As the actual leader of the Gao-Rao anti-party alliance, Peng Dehuai was still not dead, and secretly intensified his activities, further seeking political capital for his usurpation of the Party and the military. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out acutely: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit their future development, they often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves." "Defending Yan'an" is precisely the tool and signal of Peng Dehuai adopting the strategy of "attacking to defend" and intensifying his anti-party conspiracy activities. Indeed, after several years of careful preparation, by 1959, this anti-party conspirator had gone all out and launched a mad attack on the Central Committee and Chairman Mao. At this time, Xi'an staged a play based on the anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an," drumming up support for Peng Dehuai's anti-party activities. After the Party's Lushan Conference thoroughly smashed Peng Dehuai's anti-party clique's attack and removed his position, the struggle did not end. Until 1962, the anti-party play praising Peng Dehuai was still being performed as a key preserved play in various places, and the anti-party novel continued to be praised in some publications. All of this was supported by the anti-revolutionary revisionist clique led by the Chinese Khrushchev, and was part of their conspiracy to usurp the Party and the state. The Chinese Khrushchev covered up Peng Dehuai's attacks in 1954 and 1959 and personally rehabilitated Peng Dehuai around 1962, and also instigated the creation of the big poisonous weed "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," encouraging Peng Dehuai to rise again. The Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the literary and art circles, such as Zhou Yang and Feng Xuefeng, had long jumped out to praise the anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an." Another leader of the literary and art black line, Lin Mochuan, said in 1964 that "Defending Yan'an" is a "good book," encouraging the author to expand and revise it into a four- or five-volume epic, attempting to make Peng Dehuai immortal. The struggle is so sharp and complex, heart-wrenching! This is an important aspect of the struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines fighting to the death. We must hold high the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly settle the accounts of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agent Peng Dehuai's anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes, thoroughly criticize the anti-party novel "Defending Yan'an," smash Peng Dehuai's black monument, and thoroughly eliminate its poison!

    《保卫延安》——利用小说反党的活标本
    文红军　左红兵　新北文
    我们伟大领袖毛主席在八届十中全会上指出：“利用小说进行反党活动，是一大发明。”中国的赫鲁晓夫的代理人、反党阴谋家彭德怀，就是毛主席所痛斥的这样一个反党的大“发明”家。长期以来，他在野心勃勃地大抓枪杆子的同时，也狠抓反革命的笔杆子。为了替自己篡党篡军制造舆论，他收买一些反党文人，通过各种文艺形式，篡改历史，为自己树碑立传。反党小说《保卫延安》，就是其中十分突出的一例。
    《保卫延安》是在彭德怀的亲自策划、支持下炮制出来的。一九四八年秋，野心勃勃的反党阴谋家彭德怀接见了这部黑书的作者，对他写的一些直接间接地为彭德怀捧场的战地通讯大加夸奖，进而要他用文艺作品来“好好反映一下解放战争在西北战场的情况。”主子垂青赏识，奴才心领神会。这部黑书的作者“听到彭总的当面指示”以后，就“下定决心，不管能力高低，一定要写一部书”，好让人们去“瞻仰”这个反党野心家的形象。在小说写作过程中，彭德怀及其亲信为作者提供了种种方便条件。小说出笼之后，彭德怀特意召见小说作者，给予盛情款待，夸奖他在文学事业上的“成功”。从这里可以看出这个反党野心家，是多么重视这部大毒草在为他篡党篡军制造舆论准备方面的作用！
      颠倒历史、贪天之功的大骗局
    一九四七年是中国革命历史上一个伟大的转折点。在我们伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，这一年，人民解放战争取得了具有伟大历史意义的胜利。特别是在西北战场上，毛主席亲自指挥陕北军民，粉碎了蒋匪帮二十几万兵力的重点进攻，从而使我军转入了全国规模的进攻。反党小说《保卫延安》却恶毒地篡改这段历史，一笔抹掉伟大统帅毛主席的作用和毛泽东军事思想的无比威力，无耻地美化吹捧反党老手彭德怀，极力为他捞取反党的政治资本。这就清楚地暴露了小说作者的罪恶目的以及彭德怀一伙篡党篡军的狼子野心。
    在小说《保卫延安》中，作者竭尽谄媚之能事，把彭德怀这个大野心家、大阴谋家、大军阀吹捧为“伟大的军事家”、“天才的军事家”、“西北战场的统帅”、“意志和力量铸成的人”，把青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙镇、沙家店等战役的胜利统统归之于他，把整个保卫陕甘宁边区的丰功伟绩统统归之于他，说什么：“彭总指挥部队接连打了几次胜仗”，“彭总把敌人提到这里，拉到那里，直到把敌人拖得七死八活的时候，狠狠地猛扑过去，把敌人一网打尽”，“一切都在彭总的意料之中”，……甚至肉麻地称彭德怀为“善于在艰难困苦的关头扭转一切危机局面”的了不起的人物。
    历史不容颠倒！举世闻名的延安保卫战，是我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自部署和直接指挥的。彭德怀不但没有“在艰难困苦的关头扭转一切危机局面”，相反，每到这种关头，他总是站在机会主义一边来加剧“危机局面”。当着蒋介石、胡宗南以重兵向延安疯狂进犯的时候，就是这个在第二次国内革命战争时期大搞什么“御敌于国门之外”的彭德怀，又提出要“在延安大门外斩断敌人魔爪”这一“左”的机会主义主张。在这一关键时刻，是我们伟大领袖毛主席作出了极为英明的决策。根据毛主席的指示，在敌我兵力悬殊的情况下，我们不能和敌人生打硬拚，而应运用我军的有利条件，诱敌深入，采取“蘑菇”战术，把敌人拖得精疲力竭而歼灭之。在我军撤离延安之前，毛主席就预先布置我军以一支小部队引敌人主力到安塞方向，而以我主力在青化砭伏击敌人的侧翼。结果，在刚离开延安的第六天，就吃掉了敌军三十一旅。彭德怀这个不学无术的大军阀，却根本不能理解毛主席的伟大的战略思想。青化砭胜利之后，他不肯再和敌人周旋下去，跳出来反对毛主席制定的“蘑菇”战术，要我军立即北上打榆林，或南下攻敌后，急于同敌人决战。毛主席当即复电批判了彭德怀的这种军事冒险主义思想，指示我军继续采取原来的办法，同敌人在现地区再周旋一个时期，使敌人达到十分疲劳和十分缺粮的程度，然后寻机歼灭之。正是在毛主席的亲自部署和调度下，按照毛主席制定的正确方针，我军才先后又在羊马河和蟠龙镇打了两场十分漂亮的胜仗。
    在这些战役中，彭德怀任意违背毛主席的指示，使战斗险遭失利。就拿蟠龙镇攻坚战来说，当镇内敌人一度凭着坚固的工事和猛烈的炮火顽强抵抗，而小部分敌援军也逐渐逼近的时候，作为前线指挥官的彭德怀，竟然动摇害怕起来，想掉头就走，几乎使我军这次作战前功尽弃。在这千钧一发之际，毛主席向广大指战员发出了坚持下去就是胜利的战斗号令，终于攻下了蟠龙镇，歼灭了胡宗南的王牌军李昆岗部七千多人，并且获得了大批给养。同过去的青化砭、羊马河战斗一样，蟠龙镇战役也完全是克服彭德怀的错误指挥才取得胜利的。至于成为西北战场转折点的沙家店战役，更是由毛主席亲自指挥的。战斗前，毛主席直接召集作战会议，制订作战方案；战斗打响之后，毛主席彻夜不眠，亲自用电话指挥作战。为了诱敌北上，毛主席从攻打榆林时起，亲自带领几百名中央机关人员和警卫战士，同五六万蒋匪军周旋，最后把敌人牵引到预定的作战区域——沙家店东北的黄河边上，保证了战斗的胜利。这里表现了我们伟大领袖所特有的“胸中自有雄兵百万”的惊人胆略。而彭德怀，不仅在沙家店战役的第一阶段没有正确执行毛主席佯攻榆林的战略指示，而且在沙家店战役后，又背着毛主席擅自决定第二次攻打榆林，再度给我军造成不必要的损失，犯下了不可饶恕的罪行。活生生的历史事实，一次又一次无情地扯破了彭德怀及其心腹们吹嘘的所谓“天才的军事家”的谎言。
    整个延安保卫战的胜利，完全是毛主席英明指挥的胜利，是毛主席光辉的人民战争理论和实践的胜利，是伟大的毛泽东军事思想战胜彭德怀的机会主义军事路线和资产阶级军事思想的辉煌胜利！
    反党小说《保卫延安》篡改历史，颠倒黑白，一笔抹煞毛主席的革命军事路线同彭德怀的机会主义路线的斗争，只字不提彭德怀的错误和罪行，相反，对他百般美化，极力吹捧，甚至偷天换日，将毛主席亲自指挥的延安保卫战的胜利，统统记在彭德怀的名下，把毛主席光辉的战略思想，完全移植到彭德怀身上，妄图使之贴金成佛，真是无耻之极。这是一个为大野心家彭德怀策划的篡党篡军制造舆论的大阴谋，是一场欺世盗名的大骗局！
    肆意诽谤我们伟大领袖的大毒草
    一九五二年，彭德怀在“接见”反党电影剧本《延安保卫战》的编剧人员时曾说：“中央留在陕北，就是为了吸引敌人。”这句黑话充分暴露了这个大阴谋家的反党野心。他早就把陕北解放战争的胜利，看成是自己的“功劳”，从根本上否定了党中央和毛主席留在陕北的伟大意义。反党小说《保卫延安》很投彭德怀的“意”。书中从头到尾，只字不提毛主席在此重要历史关头作为中国革命伟大舵手对全国解放战争的英明指导作用，只字不提毛主席留在陕北指挥军民一起奋战所给予群众的巨大鼓舞，反而在具体描写中别有用心地突出渲染我们伟大领袖受人保护这一点。在第六章《沙家店》中，作者一面竭力宣扬彭德怀如何出入枪林弹雨，亲临前沿阵地指挥；另一面，作为对照，精心安排了一段在这紧急的决战时刻，在我兵力不足的情况下，还得把纵队警卫连派去保护毛主席的情节。作者运用这种卑劣的手段，把毛主席和党中央写成西北战场的一大包袱，把彭德怀捧到九天云上。
    小说作者为了达到贬低毛主席、抬高彭德怀的罪恶目的，伪造历史，编造谎言，无所不用其极。小说开头描写在我军撤离延安的当夜，敌人“已经进到城南的七里铺”，这时，许多“等着出发命令的人，不停地望着”“王家坪半山坡一个窑洞”的灯光，那里，据说彭德怀和指挥员们还在研究作战部署。与此同时，小说又用灰暗低沉的色调，描写毛主席在“战斗部队”保护下，从枣园村那边悄悄地离开了延安。经过这样一番对照之后，作者借我军指战员的口写道：“天明敌人就可能到延安，可是彭副总司令还在这里！”而“我们中央机关和毛主席，大概撤退到延安北边什么地方了！”一褒一贬，何等鲜明！小说炮制者在这里的罪恶企图，就是妄想把彭德怀这个小丑美化为肩负中国革命重任的“统帅”，是扭转战局的伟大人物；而真正在战斗前夜运筹帷幄的我们伟大领袖毛主席，反倒成了无关紧要的人。其用心何其毒也！
    事实上，我军撤离延安前，王家坪那盏照彻全国的永不熄灭的灯光，不是什么彭德怀的，而是我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的。从一九四六年蒋介石发动内战的前夜起，毛主席为了有力地指导战局，特地由枣园搬到王家坪人民解放军总司令部来住。胡宗南匪帮进犯延安期间，毛主席不顾敌机野蛮轰炸，在王家坪亲自部署和指挥了七天七夜的阻击战，消灭了大量敌人，粉碎了蒋、胡匪帮“三天占领延安”的美梦。三月十六日，敌军付出巨大代价后，进抵金盆湾、南泥湾一带，逼近延安的大门。然而，王家坪依然彻夜亮着灯火，我们敬爱的领袖泰然自若，坚持指挥全国和全西北战场的人民解放战争，为中国人民日夜操劳。直到三月十八日晚，敌人窜到延安城郊，枪声已清晰可闻，毛主席和党中央的同志才离开延安。小说的炮制者狗胆包天，用偷天换日的手法，歪曲历史真相，贬低我们领袖毛主席的伟大历史作用，他们的反动面目，不是昭然若揭了吗？
    更加令人不能容忍的是，小说大写黑话，直接攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席。例如，书中写了连长周大勇和李振德老汉的一段对话。李老汉说：“咱们毛主席一算就知道敌人的心思啦”，“毛主席在那里划个圈，敌人走到那里就倒楣。”这本是陕北人民对毛主席无限信仰的最真挚的感情，而作者对此却很反感，他借周大勇之口，冷冷地说：“没有这么回事”，“照你的说法，毛主席就成了神仙啦！”竭力否定毛主席的英明预见和天才指挥。这样还不够，作者又特意通过周大勇的内心活动向人们解释：“我军能打胜仗，那是因为凭着怎样的军事思想。”这里所说的“怎样的军事思想”，就是全书极力宣扬的“彭总思想”，是属于彭德怀这个所谓“伟大的军事家”的。小说炮制者对待我们伟大领袖和对待他的黑主子，是何等的“憎爱分明”！
    小说《保卫延安》就是这样一部秉承彭德怀的意旨，肆无忌惮地诽谤我们伟大领袖毛主席的大毒草。
    射向人民群众和人民军队的大毒箭
    毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”《保卫延安》的炮制者出于他反动的政治目的，却把彭德怀打扮成“救世主”，把边区人民群众和我军广大指战员糟踏得不成样子。
    出现在《保卫延安》里的陕甘宁边区的一般群众，不是害怕国民党军事进攻的软骨头，就是等待彭德怀派人去拯救的可怜虫。
    请看，小说把延安人民有计划有组织有秩序的疏散丑化成了什么样子：“田地里到处是被打坏的车子、农具、家具，还有衣服、被子、棉花，正在吐火冒烟”；“女人尖锐的喊声，孩子们的哭声”；“老乡们老的老，小的小，去逃难，可是逃到哪里去呢？”……
    请看，小说把延安人民面临蒋匪帮进攻时的精神状态歪曲成了什么样子：“老太太望着大车上的尸首跟受伤的孩子，失魂落魄地发呆”；“成千上万的老人、妇女、娃娃，带着苦难和失去亲人的痛苦，向前走去。他们沉重的脚，趟起了漫天尘土”；“唉，仗要打到什么年月，以后的日子可怎么过呀！”……
    这哪里象解放战争时期陕甘宁边区人民在党领导下的有计划的撤退？这哪里象英雄的延安人民？这是对历史的极大歪曲！对人民的莫大污蔑！
    陕北人民群众长期在党中央毛主席的身边，有着高度的政治觉悟和丰富的斗争经验。在党的教育下，他们懂得我军主动放弃延安的战略意义。在胡宗南匪帮的进攻面前，延安人民从容不迫，处之泰然。有伟大领袖毛主席和他们战斗在一起，他们心里感到无比踏实。他们满怀胜利的信心，组织起来，坚壁清野，让敌人吃不上，喝不上，只落得一座空城。在整个陕北战争中，他们支前，带路，配合正规部队作战，严密封锁消息，使敌人到处扑空挨打，对战争胜利作出了卓越的贡献。然而《保卫延安》的作者出于他反革命的政治需要，却故意违背这一历史真实，制造出一幅所谓人民“逃难”的凄惨图画，以便压低人民群众，衬托和抬高彭德怀的形象，好让他成为拯民于水火的“大救星”“大英雄”。这就是作者恶毒而又卑劣的用心。
    出于同样目的，这部反党小说对我军战士也进行了严重歪曲。作者所描写的许多指战员形象，实际上都不是真正用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级战士，而是所谓“彭总怎样决定，我们就怎样执行”的活机器。他们被安排在那里的重要目的，就是为了众星拱月般地突出全书真正的中心人物彭德怀。除了旅长陈兴允经常肉麻地吹捧彭德怀之外，小说描写战斗英雄王老虎经过一场血战，处于昏迷状态中，想到的竟然不是别的，而是他自己又当上了战斗英雄，朦胧地感到“彭副总司令向他走来了，眼里闪着又严肃又亲热的光……”（看，作者为了吹捧彭德怀，把英雄人物糟踏到了何等地步！）团参谋长卫毅在战场上考虑的，也是“彭副总司令在望着他，要求他把最大的忠诚拿出来。”快板歌手李江国一再编唱：“彭总撒开满天网，又抓俘虏又缴枪。”连长周大勇则用他的行动体现了彭德怀那套单凭军事、硬拚硬杀的资产阶级货色。小说炮制者曾经煞有介事地声称，他要探索“什么力量使我们的战争获胜？什么力量能使那些看来平凡的人，做出惊天动地的英雄事业？”《保卫延安》提供的答案是：“巨大的精神力量”来自彭德怀。看，《保卫延安》的炮制者是何等的肆无忌惮！他们反党反人民反毛主席达到了何等疯狂的地步！伟大的中国人民解放军是毛主席亲手缔造和领导的人民的军队，是按照毛主席的建军思想创立起来的伟大的军队。伟大的领袖毛主席是我军指战员心中最红最红的红太阳，光辉的毛泽东思想是我军战无不胜的精神源泉。《保卫延安》的炮制者却妄图把彭德怀的反动思想打扮成光辉的毛泽东思想，把彭德怀这个小丑吹捧为我军广大指战员精神力量的源泉，从这里可以充分看出这个大军阀篡党篡军的政治野心！
    尤其不能容忍的是，小说为了迎合彭德怀篡夺军权的狼子野心，竟然把我们的部队、我们的战士作为进身礼品，送给了这个野心家，称他们为“彭总的战士”。这是对一个野心勃勃、踌躇满志的反党阴谋家所唱的肉麻的赞歌。而在这赞歌声中，我们的战士和革命群众都被当成了祭品。我们在这里要严正警告彭德怀以及《保卫延安》的炮制者：不许你污蔑我们的战士！我们的战士永远忠于人民，忠于无产阶级，忠于我们的伟大统帅毛主席！江河不会倒流，彭德怀想让我们战士归你个人所有，这是痴心妄想！
    资产阶级军事路线的代表作
    《保卫延安》直接鼓吹彭德怀的资产阶级的反动军事路线，以对抗和取代毛主席的无产阶级的革命军事路线。这是小说反党罪行的又一重要方面。
    中国人民解放军按照毛主席的无产阶级建军纲领，历来都是主张突出无产阶级政治，用政治统帅军事，把政治工作放在首位的。毛主席早就教导我们：“中国的红军是一个执行革命的政治任务的武装集团”，“红军决不是单纯地打仗的”，“八路军更有一种极其重要和极其显著的东西，这就是它的政治工作。”小说《保卫延安》则反其道而行之，拚命地鼓吹突出军事，实际上是突出资产阶级政治的反动军事路线，把参加陕北战争的中国人民解放军别有用心地写成一支只顾打仗的单纯军事力量。它不但没有担负“宣传群众、组织群众、武装群众”的任务，而且对毛主席的伟大战略思想一窍不通，完全不懂毛主席提出的主动放弃延安的伟大战略意义。当部队听到我方暂时撤离延安的消息后，指战员们一个个都恸哭起来，狂喊狂叫：“拚呀！拚呀！”“我们豁出来咯，拚呀！”这简直是对我军政治工作的莫大的嘲弄！
    毛主席在一九四八年总结西北解放战争经验时曾经指出：西北作战之所以取得一系列胜利，原因很多，“但是最值得注意的，是在冬季两个多月中用诉苦和三查方法进行了新式的整军运动。”在《军队内部的民主运动》一文中，毛主席也着重指出部队“三查”
  “三整”的重要意义，并且提到“此项军事民主，在陕北蟠龙战役和晋察冀石家庄战役中，都实行了，收到了极大效果。”但是，打着反映这一时期西北解放战争旗号的小说《保卫延安》，却丝毫没有表现我军开展的这些政治运动和政治工作。小说虽然用极其有限的篇幅写了周大勇自发的诉苦场面，其目的也不过是为了介绍一下周大勇的身世，完全不是作为一项有组织、有计划、有领导的政治运动来写的。小说里描写的一些我军政治工作干部，如团政委李诚等，实际上只是贯彻彭德怀资产阶级军事路线的工具。李诚津津乐道的，就是单纯的练习军事技术。作者之所以在部队的战斗间隙不厌其烦地大写练兵，让干部和战士的精力都贯注在单纯军事技术的提高上，无非是想说明沙家店等战役的胜利，不是毛主席的无产阶级军事路线的胜利，而是彭德怀的资产阶级军事路线的胜利。彭德怀为了改变我军的无产阶级性质，一贯地反对在军队中突出无产阶级政治，胡说什么：“部队军事训练成绩的优劣，各级干部学习军事科学成绩的优劣，是决定我军今后战斗力高低的基本标准。”《保卫延安》所宣扬的打仗单凭军事、不靠政治的资产阶级货色，也正是彭德怀这种反动观点的大贩卖，是为彭德怀妄图使我军演变为反革命复辟工具的目的效劳的。
    毛主席在许多著作中，历来都把人民的游击战争放在一个十分重要的地位，指出：“人民的游击战争，从整个革命战争的观点看来，和主力红军是互为左右手，只有主力红军而无人民的游击战争，就象一个独臂将军。”毛主席还一再教导我们：“根据地的人民条件，具体地说来，特别是对于作战说来，就是有武装起来了的人民。敌人视为畏途，主要地也在这一点。”彭德怀这个老牌机会主义者，始终反对毛主席的人民战争思想，片面强调正规部队而极力抹煞游击队、人民武装地方兵团的作用。全国解放以后，彭德怀在中国赫鲁晓夫的支持下，打着所谓“正规化”“现代化”的幌子，疯狂地反对大办民兵，反对所谓“游击习气”，疯狂地推行资产阶级军事路线。小说《保卫延安》的炮制者同主子彭德怀一样，蓄意贬低人民游击战争的作用。全书百分之九十九的篇幅都是写正规部队的活动，丝毫也看不到地方武装和游击队在陕北解放战争中的贡献。书里提到的唯一的一支游击队，则是一些不会打仗、一切全靠正规部队扶持的人，根本不是能征善战、从敌人手里夺取武器的人民英雄。小说作者企图通过这样别有用心的描写，使人产生一种假象：延安保卫战的胜利，既不是毛主席人民战争思想的胜利，也不是广大陕北人民英勇斗争的结果，而只是所谓“西北战场的统帅”彭德怀指挥的这一支正规部队的功勋。这不仅是对历史的歪曲和对人民群众的污蔑，更是对毛主席的无产阶级军事路线最露骨的攻击！
    彻底砸烂彭德怀的黑纪念碑
    《保卫延安》这株反党的大毒草在一九五四年出笼并且大量印行，这决不是偶然的。一九五四年二月，我们党举行了七届四中全会，彻底揭露了高岗、饶漱石的反党罪行。作为高、饶反党联盟实际领袖的彭德怀仍然贼心不死，暗中更加紧了活动，进一步为自己篡党篡军捞取政治资本。我们伟大领袖毛主席一针见血地指出：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”《保卫延安》正是彭德怀采取“以攻为守”策略，加紧反党阴谋活动的一个工具和信号。果然，经过几年处心积虑的准备，到一九五九年，这个反党阴谋家便赤膊上阵，向党中央和毛主席发动了疯狂的进攻。正在这时，西安上演了根据反党小说改编的话剧《保卫延安》，替彭德怀的反党活动擂鼓助威。在党的庐山会议彻底粉碎了彭德怀反党集团的进攻并且罢了他的官之后，斗争并没有完结。直到一九六二年，歌颂彭德怀的反党话剧依然被作为重点保留剧目在各地演出，反党小说则继续在一些刊物上受到吹捧。这一切都是受到以中国赫鲁晓夫为首的反革命修正主义集团支持的，是他们篡党篡国的阴谋活动的一个组成部分。中国赫鲁晓夫在一九五四年、一九五九年两次为彭德怀的进攻做掩护，一九六二年前后又亲自为彭德怀翻案，并且策动炮制大毒草《海瑞罢官》，鼓励彭德怀东山再起。中国赫鲁晓夫在文艺界的代理人周扬、冯雪峰之流，更是老早就跳出来大捧特捧反党小说《保卫延安》。文艺黑线的另一个头目林默涵，到一九六四年还说《保卫延安》是“好书”，鼓励作者把它扩充修改成四、五部长篇巨著，妄图使彭德怀永载史册。斗争就是这样尖锐复杂，惊心动魄！这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线进行生死搏斗的一个重要方面。我们必须高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底清算中国赫鲁晓夫及其代理人彭德怀反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，彻底批判反党小说《保卫延安》，砸烂彭德怀的这块黑纪念碑，彻底清除它的流毒。
