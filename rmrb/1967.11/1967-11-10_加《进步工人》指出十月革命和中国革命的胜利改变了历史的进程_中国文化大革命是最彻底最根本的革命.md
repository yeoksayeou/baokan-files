The Progressive Worker, the organ of the progressive workers' movement in Canada, published an article in its November issue comparing the developments after the Russian Revolution and the Chinese Revolution. The article enthusiastically praises the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, as "the most thorough and fundamental revolution in human history." The article states: "This revolution addresses the complex issue of how to conduct class struggle and revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat."

The article, titled "Two Festivals," first points out that the victory of the October Revolution in Russia in 1917 and the victory of the Chinese Revolution in 1949 are "two major historical events of world-shaking significance." "These two events have changed the course of history, and especially the Chinese Revolution, together with the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, is making a tremendous contribution to determining the future of humanity. The world's working class studies the development of these two revolutions to gain important lessons in the strategy and tactics of proletarian socialist revolution."

The article states: "Under the leadership of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, the Russian Revolution set a precedent for the working class to seize and consolidate state power." "The revolution of 1917 became a source of inspiration for the working class of the world, clearly showing the path that should be followed to seize power." The article highly praises the continuous victories and great achievements of the Soviet people in various fields after the October Revolution. The article then points out that after the victory of the October Revolution, the problem of how to conduct revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat was not solved in the Soviet Union. Therefore, after Stalin's death, the revisionist clique led by Khrushchev was able to seize power, overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat, and restore capitalism in the Soviet Union.

The article severely condemns the revisionist ruling clique in the Soviet Union for implementing a policy of surrender to American imperialism. The article points out that the Soviet revisionists have invited imperialists to invest in the Soviet Union and participate in the exploitation of Soviet workers. Under the pretext of "aid," the Soviet revisionists exploit Asian and African countries imperialistically. "They also voluntarily act as running dogs for American imperialism, striving to prevent people from rising up for national liberation struggles, and when struggles still break out, they try to sabotage them."

The article emphasizes: "The workers of the Soviet Union face the task of carrying out a second revolution. We are deeply convinced that the revolution will come, and the working people of the Soviet Union will no longer be deceived by the representatives of the bourgeoisie, the revisionists."

Next, the article enthusiastically praises the great victories achieved under the leadership of Chairman Mao in the Chinese Revolution. The article states that the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949 "opened up a historic path of progress for the laboring people of the whole world, which has changed the face of the world and made a great contribution to determining the destiny of humanity."

The article emphasizes: The victory of China was achieved under the outstanding leadership of Mao Zedong after nearly thirty years of struggle. "The lessons gained from these long years of struggle are of inestimable importance. But more importantly, the lessons learned from the Chinese Revolution after seizing power and establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat. We can see that the complex problem of how to conduct revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat was not solved in the Soviet Union, resulting in the restoration of the bourgeoisie through the betrayal of the revisionists. Solving these problems has become the primary task of the Chinese Revolution; under the leadership of Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the Chinese people have proven themselves worthy of the responsibility entrusted to them by history."

The article states that Chairman Mao has long been concerned with the problem of how to conduct revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and has written brilliant works such as "On Contradiction" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," which clearly point out the way to solve this problem. "It is precisely because Chairman Mao has made such outstanding analyses of these problems and proposed practical solutions that his works have great importance in the era when the forces of socialism triumph over the forces of imperialism—Mao Zedong's works are contemporary Marxism-Leninism."

When discussing the problem of class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the article states that the Chinese Khrushchev opposes Chairman Mao's correct line, advocates the theory of the extinction of class struggle, and aims to "deceive the Chinese working masses, disarm them, and pave the way for the restoration of capitalists and landlords." The fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev are actually a replica of the nonsense spouted by the Khrushchev revisionist clique about the "state of the whole people" and the "party of the whole people."

The article states: "It is precisely to eliminate the harmful influence of (the Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda) and to overthrow a handful of power-holders who are taking the capitalist road, that Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Mao Zedong is the most thorough and fundamental revolution in human history. This revolution addresses the complex issue of how to conduct class struggle and revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong, the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, the Chinese masses are opening up a new and unprecedented path to communism—a path that the hundreds of millions of laboring people of the world will ultimately follow, and their journey will be made easier because Chairman Mao and the Chinese revolutionaries have already opened the way forward."

The article enthusiastically states: "Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line has been in the dominant position in China for the past eighteen years, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will ensure that Mao Zedong's line continues to be in the dominant position, ensuring that China remains red forever. We once again express our belief that Mao Zedong's revolutionary line will ultimately triumph, and that imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries will be thoroughly defeated."

The article emphasizes: "The Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong—and the people of the world—will overcome all difficulties, remove all obstacles, and strive forward for victory."

The article concludes with a resounding call: "Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!"

    加《进步工人》指出十月革命和中国革命的胜利改变了历史的进程
    中国文化大革命是最彻底最根本的革命
    新华社九日讯　渥太华消息：加拿大进步工人运动机关刊《进步工人》月刊十一月号发表文章，对比俄国革命和中国革命后的发展进程，热情地赞扬世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命是“人类前所未有过的最彻底、最根本的革命”，“这个革命解决的是在无产阶级专政下如何进行阶级斗争和进行革命的复杂问题”。文章说：中国人民“在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东的天才指导下，正在开辟通向共产主义的新的和前所未有的道路”。
    这篇题为《两个节日》的文章首先指出：一九一七年俄国十月革命的胜利和一九四九年中国革命的胜利是“两个具有震撼世界的重要意义的历史性重大事件”。“这两个事件改变了历史的进程，特别是中国革命，加上伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，正在对决定人类的未来作出巨大贡献。世界工人阶级研究这两个革命发展的过程，就可以获得无产阶级社会主义革命战略和策略方面的重要教益。”
    文章说：“在列宁和俄国布尔什维克的领导下，俄国革命开创了工人阶级夺取和巩固国家政权的先例。”“一九一七年的革命成了世界工人阶级得到鼓舞的源泉，它向世界工人阶级清楚地表明了夺取政权所应当遵循的道路”。文章高度赞扬十月革命后苏联人民在各方面所不断取得的胜利和巨大成就。文章接着指出，十月革命胜利后，在苏联没有解决在无产阶级专政条件下如何进行革命的问题。因此，在斯大林逝世后，以赫鲁晓夫为首的修正主义集团得以篡夺政权，推翻无产阶级专政，在苏联复辟资本主义。
    文章严厉谴责苏联修正主义统治集团实行投降美帝国主义的政策。文章指出，苏修已经邀请帝国主义在苏联投资，参加剥削苏联工人。苏修在“援助”的幌子下对亚非国家进行帝国主义剥削。“他们还自愿充当美帝国主义的走狗，竭力阻止人民起来进行民族解放斗争”，并且在“仍然爆发斗争时设法加以破坏”。
    文章强调说：“苏联工人面临进行第二次革命的任务。我们深信，革命一定会来到，苏联劳动人民将永远不再受资产阶级的代理人修正主义者的欺骗。”
    接着，文章热烈赞扬毛主席英明领导下的中国革命所取得的伟大胜利。文章说，一九四九年中华人民共和国的成立“开辟了全世界劳动人民取得历史性进展的道路，这些进展改变了世界的面貌，并且在决定人类命运方面作了很大贡献。”
    文章强调指出：中国的胜利是在毛泽东的卓越领导下经过将近三十年的斗争以后取得的。“从这些长期斗争年代的丰富经验中获得的教益，具有无法估量的重要性。但是更为重要的是在夺取政权和建立无产阶级专政以后从中国革命获得的教益。我们可以看到，在无产阶级专政条件下如何进行革命的复杂问题在苏联并未解决，结果是通过修正主义者的背叛使资产阶级得以复辟。解决这些问题成了中国革命的首要任务；在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席的领导下，中国人民证明完全无愧于历史赋予他们的责任。”
    文章说，毛主席很早就注意解决无产阶级专政条件下如何进行革命的问题，并且写了象《矛盾论》和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这样的光辉著作，这些著作清楚指出了解决这个问题的道路。“正是由于毛主席对这些问题作出了这样卓越的分析，而且提出了实际的解决办法，因此在社会主义力量战胜帝国主义力量的时代，他的著作具有极大的重要性——毛泽东著作是当代的马克思列宁主义。”
    文章在谈到无产阶级专政条件下的阶级斗争的问题时说，中国赫鲁晓夫反对毛主席的正确路线，鼓吹阶级斗争熄灭论，其目的是“想欺骗中国劳动群众，解除他们的武装，为资本家和地主的复辟铺平道路”。中国赫鲁晓夫的谬论实际上是赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团所胡说的“全民国家”、“全民党”的翻版。
    文章说：“正是为了消除（中国赫鲁晓夫散布的）有害的影响，为了革一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命，毛主席亲自发动和领导了无产阶级文化大革命。毛泽东领导的无产阶级文化大革命是人类前所未有过的最彻底、最根本的革命。这个革命解决的是在无产阶级专政下如何进行阶级斗争和进行革命的复杂问题。中国群众在当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东的天才指导下，正在开辟通向共产主义的新的和前所未有的道路——全世界的亿万劳动人民最后也将走的道路，他们的旅程将由于毛主席和中国革命派已经开辟了前进的道路而比较容易了。”
    文章热情地说：“毛泽东的无产阶级革命路线过去十八年来在中国占据了统治的地位，无产阶级文化大革命将保证毛泽东的路线继续占统治地位，保证中国永远保持红色。我们再次表示我们相信毛泽东的革命路线必将最后胜利，帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派必将彻底失败。”
    文章强调说：“以战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民——以及世界人民，将克服一切困难，排除一切障碍，向前争取胜利。”
    文章最后欢呼：“中华人民共和国万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛泽东主席万岁！”
