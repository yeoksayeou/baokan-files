BEIJING, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) — Albanian Ambassador to China Vasili Natanaeli held a reception tonight to celebrate the 18th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Albania and China.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and other relevant officials including Wang Shusheng, Qiao Guanhua, Li Qiang, Xie Huaiyi, Zhou Yiping, and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat attended the reception at the invitation.

Ambassador Natanaeli and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Qiao Guanhua both spoke at the reception. They toasted to the health and longevity of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha! They warmly praised the fraternal friendship between the peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, reaching a new peak. They expressed that the peoples of China and Albania will forever stand together in the common struggle against U.S.-led imperialism, against modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, against the Tito clique, and against the reactionaries of all countries, and march forward to victory.

Ambassador Natanaeli said, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong, has achieved brilliant victories. These victories not only have great historical significance for the Chinese people but also for the revolutionary people of all countries and for the world revolution and the cause of socialism.

Today, China enjoys high international prestige and has become a solid base for world revolution.

Qiao Guanhua said in his speech that under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, the Albanian people are carrying out a cultural revolution to prevent the emergence of revisionism and the restoration of capitalism, making the whole country present a thriving revolutionary scene.

Qiao Guanhua said, the 18 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Albania have been 18 years of great development in the great friendship between the two parties and the peoples of the two countries. Chairman Mao pointed out: "We are your true friends and comrades. You are also our true friends and comrades." Let all imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries tremble before our great fighting friendship.

At the reception filled with a warm and friendly atmosphere, an Albanian documentary film was shown.
