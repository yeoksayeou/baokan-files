The grand art exhibition "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Line" held to celebrate the 18th anniversary of the founding of the nation is a passionate hymn to the great leader Chairman Mao, to the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The scale of the exhibition is unprecedented, featuring 1,600 pieces including Chinese paintings, oil paintings, prints, propaganda posters, clay sculptures, and handicrafts. Apart from being displayed at the National Art Museum of China in the capital, the exhibition is also touring factories and rural areas. This exhibition demonstrates a new atmosphere of proletarian revolutionary art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving proletarian politics. This is a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a brilliant victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts!

The first distinctive feature of the exhibition is its revolutionary nature.

Comrade Lin Biao said, "All our achievements and victories are gained under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao and are victories of Mao Zedong Thought." The works in the exhibition collectively embody this great revolutionary theme. From large clay sculptures to small commemorative badges, from large oil paintings to intricate paper cuts, each piece is dedicated to propagating the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and praising our dearest red sun, Chairman Mao.

The group of woodcuts "Long Live Chairman Mao" created by the Red Guards of Beijing Normal University vividly depicts the magnificent scenes of revolutionary mass movements led by Chairman Mao throughout the long history of our country's revolutionary struggles. This is a declaration by the Red Guards to be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and a pledge to follow Chairman Mao to carry the revolution through to the end. The giant Chinese painting "Bombard the Headquarters—My Big-Character Poster" created by the Red Guards of the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts is grand in scale and powerful in brushwork, portraying the great image of Chairman Mao with far-sighted vision and a pen in hand.

The wind of revolution sweeps across the land, and the waves roll on. Last year, revolutionary teachers and students from all over the country broke through the numerous obstacles of the bourgeois reactionary line, gathered in Beijing to receive Chairman Mao's inspection. The sky is filled with red clouds, and Chairman Mao comes among the people. Millions of hands reach out to Chairman Mao, and the song "The East Is Red" resounds. The Red Guards picked up their brushes and depicted this magnificent scene. Works such as "Chairman Mao Ascends Tiananmen," "Chairman Mao at Jinwumen Bridge," "Millions of Sunflowers Face the Sun," and "Chairman Mao with the Red Guards" collectively express the Red Guards' boundless love, admiration, and faith in Chairman Mao, and their resolve to follow Chairman Mao in revolution for life.

What is the wish of the working class? It is to spread the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world. The workers of the Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory, together with revolutionary artists, created the sculpture "The Worker's Wish," which embodies this aspiration. A young worker gazes at the sun in the clear sky, sculpting the great image of Chairman Mao. Red sun, red sun, with you, we can overcome all difficulties and achieve one victory after another. Three revolutionary workers from the Capital Steel Plant, who had never learned to draw, carved the likeness of Chairman Mao. Without a carving knife, they made their own; though the tools were crude, they did not hinder the working class's enthusiasm for praising Chairman Mao. Countless prints praising Chairman Mao are pasted all over the workshop and are also firmly pasted in the hearts of our workers.

Father and mother are dear, but not as dear as Chairman Mao; the river is deep, the sea is deep, but not as deep as Chairman Mao's kindness. Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the poor and lower-middle peasants. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Heilongjiang Province's Helong County use their most familiar art of paper cutting to praise Chairman Mao. Every family's window has a red image of Chairman Mao, and the red sun illuminates every household brightly.

The towering statue of Chairman Mao embodies the proletarian revolutionary faction's resolve to follow Chairman Mao closely. The badges of Chairman Mao shining on the soldiers' chests also reflect the surging revolutionary passion of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The exhibition hall displays countless shining badges of Chairman Mao, many of which are carefully made by Red Guards and worker comrades. One badge, one red heart. The badge worn on the chest, the highest directive in the heart, we will always follow Chairman Mao's words and dedicate our lives to the revolution.

Thousands of rivers flow into the sea, and all roads lead to Beijing. People of the world love Chairman Mao the most. The giant propaganda poster "The Brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought Illuminates the Revolutionary Path of the Japanese People" depicts Chairman Mao's radiant image, with Japanese people holding the red treasure book in their hands and wearing Chairman Mao's badges on their chests, enthusiastically shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao! Ten Thousand Years!" This is not only the wish of the Japanese people but also the shared aspiration of anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist fighters from all countries. Works such as "Chairman Mao Is with Us—Returning from Beijing," "The Waves of the Four Seas Surge, the Winds of the Five Continents Roar," "Chairman Mao Is with Us," and "Following Chairman Mao, the World Turns Red" also reflect the revolutionary fires of the five continents and the battle clouds of the four seas from various angles.

The second distinctive feature of the exhibition is its combat nature.

"Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people." Almost all the works in this exhibition were created in the midst of the fierce struggle between the two lines. They reflect the magnificent scene of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the Red Guards following Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and advancing courageously. They also reflect the heroic scenes of the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers in the fierce struggle between the two lines. These works have become powerful weapons for the proletarian revolutionary faction in their struggle against the enemy.

The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The storm of the "January Revolution" surged, and the revolutionary artists of Shanghai created large oil paintings and propaganda posters such as "The Storm at Anting," "Revolution Is Not a Crime, Rebellion Is Justified," "Long Live the Victory of the January Revolution," and "Long Live the Victory of the Proletarian Revolutionary Line" in the struggle, depicting the heroic spirit of the revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought seizing power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and establishing the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee. In the struggle, the workers, peasants, and soldiers of Shanghai, the Red Guards, and revolutionary artists also created many Mao Zedong Quotations posters with revolutionary pioneering spirit. These posters use vivid images and popular forms to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and spread the sparks of revolution to the people of the entire country.

Under the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, the workers and Red Guards of Guizhou faced the mad suppression of the capitalist-roaders within the Party. Behind the iron bars of a makeshift prison, they drew the brilliant image of Chairman Mao stroke by stroke. They solemnly swore in front of the portrait to be forever loyal to Mao Zedong Thought! They held up the portrait of Chairman Mao, filled with boundless strength. Today, this portrait of Chairman Mao is displayed in the exhibition.

"Without a people's army, there is nothing." The People's Liberation Army, personally founded by Chairman Mao and directly led by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, is invincible and unmatched, a steel wall defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a strong pillar defending Mao Zedong Thought. Wherever Chairman Mao points, they fight. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with one hand holding a gun and the other holding a pen, created many excellent works such as "Political Power Grows Out of the Barrel of a Gun," "Chairman Mao Establishes the Party in the Regiment," "The Four Firsts and the Three-Eight Style," and "Mao Zedong Thought Opens the Revolutionary Path of Victory for Our Army." They hang the artworks propagating Mao Zedong Thought in the barracks and sentry posts, playing a role in propaganda and mobilization. Particularly noteworthy is the clay sculpture group "The Family History of an Air Force Soldier" created by six ordinary soldiers, which has achieved outstanding results. It is a vivid and vivid image textbook of class education and a heavy artillery shell to criticize the "exploitation is meritorious" fallacy of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The third distinctive feature of the exhibition is its mass nature.

"The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." More than 60% of the works in this exhibition are created by workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the content of the works mostly reflects the struggles of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Seventy percent of the Mao Zedong Quotations posters in Shanghai are created by amateur artists from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The clay sculpture group "In Praise of the Red Guards" is a product of the joint efforts of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, Red Guards, and revolutionary professional sculptors. It can be said that this exhibition is a popularization and elevation of revolutionary art creation among the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers.

The sea is overturned, and the waves surge; a great upheaval has taken place in the field of literature and art. Works with outdated themes such as emperors, generals, talented scholars and beauties, flowers, birds, fish, insects, landscapes, and scenery have been removed from the exhibition. Countless heroic figures of workers, peasants, and soldiers such as Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Jiao Yulu, and Chen Yonggui have occupied the art front. Wang Shidong, who sacrificed his life to protect the Yellow River Bridge, Cai Yongxiang, who bravely rescued the Red Guards, Lü Xiangbi, who was selfless and dedicated, and the Red Guard hero Lü Honggen, who dared to pull the emperor off his horse, are models of studying the works of Chairman Mao, examples of the proletarian revolutionary faction, and fearless pioneers in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. These are worthy subjects for us to paint in large numbers.

Zhou Yang, Cai Ruohong, Hua Junwu, and other small cliques of counter-revolutionary revisionists have long excluded amateur authors from workers, peasants, and soldiers, attempting to banish the artworks of workers, peasants, and soldiers forever. This is a pipe dream and a wild fantasy. The Cultural Revolution thunder roared, and history, which had been overturned, was overturned again.

Look! Countless workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary artists have taken up their battle brushes, creating one new and beautiful picture after another. The workers of Guizhou's "New Song of Guizhou Cotton," the peasants of Beijing Huairou County Hongyan Commune's "Smashing the Peng Zhen Counter-Revolutionary Revisionist Clique," and the soldiers' excellent works such as "The Red Sun Shines" are surging like waves. "Who controls the rise and fall of the vast land?"—We, the masses of workers and peasants! We, the Red Guards! We, the revolutionary artists! We cheer for the workers, peasants, and soldiers occupying the art front. We eagerly hope that revolutionary artists will further integrate with the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, further improve the ideological and artistic quality of the works, strive to more deeply, typically, comprehensively, and fully reflect our great era, and more enthusiastically sing praises to our great leader Chairman Mao. Let the flowers of art nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought bloom all over China and the world.

    毛主席革命路线胜利的颂歌
    中央直属美术系统革筹小组评论组
    为庆祝建国十八周年而举办的大型美术展览《毛主席革命路线胜利万岁》，是一曲对伟大领袖毛主席、对光焰无际的毛泽东思想、对无产阶级文化大革命的热情的赞歌。展览会的规模是空前的，包括国画、油画、版画、宣传画、泥塑和工艺美术品共计一千六百多件；除在首都中国美术馆展出外，同时还在工厂、农村举行巡回展览。这次展览显示出了无产阶级革命美术为工农兵服务、为无产阶级政治服务的一片新气象。这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果，是毛主席革命文艺路线的光辉胜利！
    美展的第一个特点，是它的革命化。
    林彪同志说：“我们的一切成就，一切胜利，都是在毛主席的英明领导下取得的，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。”美展的所有作品，集中地表现了这一伟大的革命主题。从大型泥塑到小巧的纪念章，从巨幅油画到精细的剪纸，每一件作品，都是为了宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。
    北京新师院的红卫兵创作的组画《万岁毛主席》，用十一幅木刻，集中地描绘了在我国革命斗争漫长的岁月里，毛主席亲自领导的革命群众运动波澜壮阔的场景。这是红卫兵小将誓做无产阶级革命事业接班人的宣言，是紧跟毛主席将革命进行到底的决心书。中央工艺美术学院的红卫兵创作的巨幅国画《炮打司令部——我的一张大字报》，气魄雄伟，笔力凝重，画出了毛主席高瞻远瞩、手握战笔的伟大形象。
    东风万里，巨浪滚滚。全国的革命师生，去年曾冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重阻挠，汇集到北京接受毛主席的检阅。满天彩霞满天红，毛主席来到群众中，千万双手伸向毛主席，放声高唱东方红。红卫兵小将们举起画笔把这一壮丽的景象一一描绘了下来。《毛主席登上了天安门》、《毛主席来到金水桥》、《千万颗葵花向阳开》、《毛主席和红卫兵在一起》……这些作品，集中地表达了红卫兵对毛主席的无限热爱，无限崇拜，无限信仰，表达了红卫兵日夜想念毛主席，永远紧跟毛主席干一辈子革命的决心。
    什么是工人阶级的心愿？那就是把光辉的毛泽东思想传遍全世界。北京内燃机厂的工人同志，和革命美术工作者一起创作的雕塑《工人的心愿》就是这种心愿的写照。一个青年工人，仰望着晴空的太阳，正在塑造伟大的毛主席像。红太阳呀红太阳，有了您，我们就能披荆斩棘，排除万难，取得一个又一个的胜利。首都钢铁厂的三个革命职工，从来没学过画画，但是，他们凭着对毛主席的无限热爱，却刻出了毛主席的肖像。没有刻刀，自己动手制造；工具虽然简陋，却妨碍不了工人阶级歌颂毛主席的满腔热情。一幅幅歌颂毛主席的版画贴满了车间，也紧紧地贴在我们工人的心上。
    爹亲娘亲，不如毛主席亲；河深海深，不如毛主席恩情深。毛泽东思想是贫下中农的命根子。黑龙江海伦县的贫下中农，用自己最熟悉的剪纸艺术来歌颂毛主席。他们每家的窗子上，都贴着红彤彤的毛主席像，红太阳把家家户户照得亮堂堂。
    高大巍峨的毛主席塑像，寄托了无产阶级革命派紧紧跟着毛主席的革命决心，闪烁在战士胸前的毛主席像章，同样反映了工农兵汹涌澎湃的革命激情。展览厅里，陈列着无数闪闪发光的毛主席像章，其中许多是红卫兵小将和工人同志精心制成的。一枚像章，一颗红心。像章挂胸前，最高指示记在心间，我们要永远听毛主席的话，干一辈子革命。
    千里江河归大海，条条大道通北京。全世界革命人民最热爱毛主席。巨幅宣传画《毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了日本人民革命的道路》的画面上，毛主席的形象光芒四射，日本人民把红彤彤的宝书捧在手上，把毛主席的像章佩在胸前，激动地高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”这不仅是日本人民，也是世界各国反帝反修战士共同的祝愿。《毛主席和我们在一起——北京归来》、《四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激》、《毛主席和我们在一起》、《跟着毛主席，世界一片红》等等，也从各个方面反映了五洲革命的烈火，四海战斗的风云。
    美展的第二个特点，是它的战斗化。
    “革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。”这次展览，几乎所有的作品都是在两条路线的激烈斗争中产生的。它反映了广大工农兵群众和红卫兵小将紧跟毛主席的战略部署，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗奋勇前进的壮丽图景，反映了广大工农兵群众在两条路线激烈斗争中的英勇场面。这些作品已成为无产阶级革命派对敌斗争中的有力武器。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。“一月革命”的风暴汹涌澎湃，上海的革命美术工作者在斗争中创作了《安亭风暴》、《革命无罪，造反有理》、《一月革命胜利万岁》、《无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁》等大幅油画和宣传画，表现了毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权，建立上海革命委员会的英雄气概。在斗争中，上海的工农兵群众、红卫兵小将和革命美术工作者还以革命的首创精神，创作了许多毛主席语录画。这些画以鲜明的形象，普及的形式来宣传毛泽东思想，向全国人民传播革命的火种。
    在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖下，贵州的工人和红卫兵小将面对着党内走资本主义道路当权派的疯狂镇压，在私设的牢房的铁窗下，他们一笔又一笔地描画着毛主席的光辉形象。他们在画像前庄严宣誓，永远忠于毛泽东思想！他们举着毛主席像，浑身充满了无穷的力量。今天，这幅毛主席画像已经陈列在展览会上。
    “没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”毛主席亲手缔造、林彪副统帅直接领导的人民解放军，战无不胜，攻无不克，是保卫无产阶级专政的钢铁长城，是捍卫毛泽东思想的坚强柱石。毛主席指到那里，他们就打到那里。解放军战士们一手拿枪，一手拿笔，绘制了《枪杆子里面出政权》、《毛主席在连队建党》、《四个第一，三八作风》和《毛泽东思想为我军开辟了革命的胜利航道》等许多优秀的作品。他们把宣传毛泽东思想的美术作品，挂满了营房和岗哨，起到了宣传鼓动的作用。特别值得提出的是，由六位普通战士创作的《空军战士家史》泥塑群像，取得了突出的成就，它是一部极其生动的阶级教育的形象教材，也是批判中国赫鲁晓夫“剥削有功”谬论的重型炮弹。
    美展的第三个特点，是它的群众化。
    “人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”这次美展百分之六十以上的作品都是工农兵的作品，作品的内容也大都是反映工农兵的斗争生活。上海的毛主席语录画，其中有百分之七十都是工农兵业余美术作者创作的。《红卫兵赞》泥塑群像，也是解放军战士、红卫兵和革命的专业雕塑工作者相结合的产物。可以说，这次美展是革命的美术创作在广大工农兵群众中的一次普及，一次提高。
    倒海翻江卷巨澜，文艺领域里已经起了翻天覆地的大变革。帝王将相、才子佳人、花鸟鱼虫、山水风景的陈旧题材的作品，已经从展览会中清除了出去。张思德、白求恩、雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄、陈永贵等无数的工农兵英雄形象占领了美术阵地。舍身保卫黄河大桥的王士栋，英勇抢救红卫兵的蔡永祥，一心为公的吕祥璧，舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马的红卫兵小将陆荣根，他们是学习毛主席著作的模范，他们是无产阶级革命派的好榜样，他们是无产阶级文化大革命中的无畏闯将。这些都是值得我们大画特画的对象。
    周扬、蔡若虹、华君武等一小撮反革命修正主义分子长期排斥工农兵业余作者，妄图把工农兵的美术作品，永世打入冷宫。这是白日做梦，这是痴心妄想。文化大革命一声春雷，把被颠倒了的历史又颠倒了过来。
    看！无数工农兵、红卫兵和革命美术工作者拿起了战斗的画笔，创作出了一幅又一幅最新最美的图画。贵州工人的《贵棉新歌》，北京怀柔县红岩公社农民的《摧毁彭真反革命修正主义集团》，解放军战士的《红日当空》等优秀作品如潮如涌。“问苍茫大地，谁主沉浮？”——我们工农兵群众！我们红卫兵小将！我们革命的美术工作者！我们为工农兵占领美术阵地而欢呼。我们热切希望革命的美术工作者进一步和工农兵群众相结合，进一步提高作品的思想性和艺术性，以求更深刻、更典型、更概括、更全面地反映我们伟大的时代，更热烈地纵情歌颂我们伟大的领袖毛主席，让毛泽东思想哺育的工农兵艺术之花开遍全中国和全世界。
