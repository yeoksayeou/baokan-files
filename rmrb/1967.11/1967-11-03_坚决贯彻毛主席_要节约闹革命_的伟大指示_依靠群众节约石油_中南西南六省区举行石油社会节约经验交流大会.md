The conference extensively exchanged experiences in oil conservation work and called on the revolutionary cadres and workers in the oil supply, storage, and usage departments to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and to actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "save and make revolution." They were urged to quickly launch a new wave of mass oil conservation.

Representatives from Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces (autonomous regions), as well as Guangzhou and Wuhan cities, and representatives from relevant departments of the central government and local authorities attended the meeting.

The attendees repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's important instructions such as "build the country through thrift," "grasp revolution, promote production," and "save and make revolution." They pointed out that oil is a crucial strategic resource, essential for industrial and agricultural production, transportation, and rural lighting. Under the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, China's oil production has made significant strides in recent years, achieving self-sufficiency, and providing a strong material foundation for socialist construction and supporting world revolution. However, we must not relax our efforts in oil conservation. Whether oil is scarce or abundant, we must conserve it. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In every place, we must cherish manpower and material resources, and must not only consider the present and waste recklessly." Thrift in building the country and saving to make revolution are major tasks for accelerating socialist construction, strengthening preparedness, and supporting world revolution. They are also crucial for inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions of our party and cultivating successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Therefore, conserving oil is not only of great economic significance but also of great political significance.

The attendees unanimously agreed that to do a better job in social oil conservation, the most important thing is to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize proletarian politics, and resolutely respond to the great call of Chairman Mao to "criticize and repudiate self and revisionism." We must strengthen ideological education for the revolutionary masses and cadres, thoroughly criticize the poisonous influence of the revisionist goods such as "business first," "profit first," and "material incentives" pushed by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and their agents in various places in enterprise management. We must establish the fine tradition of running enterprises with thrift. At the same time, we must break old habits and establish new ones in terms of ideology and regulations to remove obstacles for the comprehensive promotion of social oil conservation work.

The attendees also believed that to do a better job in social oil conservation work, we must fully mobilize the masses and rely on them. We must channel the boundless enthusiasm released by the revolutionary masses during the Cultural Revolution into production and oil conservation. We must launch extensive oil conservation propaganda, establish oil conservation ideology, and set up oil conservation models. At the same time, various regions and departments should, under the leadership of the revolutionary "three-in-one" combined leadership bodies or the command departments on the production front, establish and improve the leadership bodies for oil conservation work, and promptly summarize and promote the advanced experiences of collective and individual oil conservation.

The meeting finally issued an appeal to the revolutionary cadres and workers in the oil production, storage, supply, and usage departments, calling on them to launch a new wave of social oil conservation.

    坚决贯彻毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示
    依靠群众节约石油
    中南西南六省区举行石油社会节约经验交流大会
    新华社广州二日电　中南、西南六省（区）石油社会节约经验交流大会最近在广州举行。会议广泛交流了石油节约工作的经验，并号召石油供应、储存和使用部门的广大革命职工，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，积极响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，迅速掀起一个群众性的节约用油的新高潮。
    出席这次会议的，有湖北、湖南、广东、广西、云南、贵州六省（区）和广州、武汉两市的代表，以及中央和各地有关部门的代表。
    到会代表通过反复学习毛主席“勤俭建国”，“抓革命，促生产”，“要节约闹革命”等一系列重要指示。他们指出，石油是重要的战略物资，是工农业生产、交通运输和当前农村照明不可缺少的燃料和原料。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的照耀下，近几年来我国石油生产有了飞跃的发展，石油产量已经基本自给，为我国社会主义建设和支援世界革命，提供了强大的物质基础。但是，我们决不能因此而放松节约用油。油少要节约，油多也要节约。毛主席教导我们：“任何地方必须十分爱惜人力物力，决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”勤俭建国，节约闹革命，是加速社会主义建设，加强战备，支援世界革命的大事，是关系到继承和发扬我党优良传统，培养无产阶级革命事业接班人的大事。因此，节约石油，不仅有重大的经济意义，而且有重大的政治意义。
    到会代表一致认为，要把石油的社会节约工作搞得更好，最重要的一条就是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席“斗私，批修”的伟大号召，加强对无产阶级革命派和革命群众的思想教育，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们在各地的代理人在企业管理方面推行的“业务挂帅”、“利润挂帅”、“物质刺激”等修正主义黑货的流毒，树立勤俭办企业的优良作风。同时，要从思想上、规章制度上，破旧立新，为全面开展石油的社会节约工作扫除障碍。
    到会人员还认为，要把石油社会节约工作做得更好，必须充分发动群众，依靠群众，把广大革命群众在文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，运用到生产方面来，运用到节约用油方面来。要大搞节油宣传，大立节油思想，大树节油样板。同时，各地区、各部门要在革命“三结合”的临时权力机构或在生产第一线指挥部的领导下，建立和健全石油节约工作的领导机构，及时总结和推广集体和个人节约用油的先进经验。
    会议最后向石油生产、储存、供应和使用部门的广大革命职工发出一封倡议书，倡议广大革命职工进一步掀起石油社会节约的新高潮。
