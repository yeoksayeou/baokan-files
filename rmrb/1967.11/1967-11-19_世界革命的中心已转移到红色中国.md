The Political Bureau of the Communist Party of Ceylon has issued a statement on the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution, praising Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. The statement points out: "The center of world revolution has shifted to the capital of Red China, Beijing, where Comrade Mao Zedong resides and guides the world revolutionary movement with his unparalleled genius."

The statement says: The workers and peasants of Russia, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party headed by Lenin, first overthrew the rule of the landlords and bourgeoisie through armed struggle on one-sixth of the world's land. This was a great inspiration and enlightenment to the workers and all oppressed peoples of other countries. They realized that what could be done in Russia could also be done in other countries. Therefore, the October Revolution became a beacon for the oppressed peoples of the world, giving them new hope and inspiration, and encouraging them to make greater efforts to achieve their own liberation.

The statement emphasizes: The most important lesson to be drawn from the October Revolution is that only through revolution, not through other means, can capitalism and exploitation be overthrown. The exploiting classes will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage. They must be kicked out by force.

The statement says: Marx and Lenin stressed that the working class must smash the existing bourgeois state machine and replace it with the state machine of the working class dictatorship. This can only be achieved through revolution, not through parliament.

The statement says: To achieve revolutionary success, the working class and its allies must have a party like the Bolshevik Party to lead the revolution. This party must be a truly revolutionary party—as taught by Comrade Mao Zedong—a disciplined party armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, practicing self-criticism, and linked with the masses. Without such a party, the revolution cannot succeed.

The statement says: After Lenin's death, Stalin continued his work. He not only led the Bolshevik Party in building socialism and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat in the first country surrounded by the capitalist world, but also defended the dictatorship of the proletariat, smashed internal sabotage, and external fascist aggression.

The statement condemns Khrushchev for seizing the leadership of the Soviet Party and state after Stalin's death and launching vicious attacks on Stalin. The statement says: Khrushchev attacked Stalin and ignored his achievements because Stalin represented the revolutionary interests of the Soviet people. Without destroying this revolutionary image, Khrushchev could not force his pseudo-revolutionary and counter-revolutionary modern revisionist poison down the throats of the Soviet people.

The statement says: Khrushchev's revisionist theory has caused great harm to the international communist movement. He attempted to impose his erroneous theories on the leadership of all communist parties, destroyed the unity of the international communist movement, and the unity of the socialist camp. When he failed to force the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labor of Albania to accept his erroneous theories, he tried to use economic blackmail and other means to intimidate and threaten the Communist Party of China and the Party of Labor of Albania. But neither Albania nor China was intimidated, and they did not abandon the correct Marxist-Leninist position.

The statement points out: The Communist Party of China, led by the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Comrade Mao Zedong, and the Party of Labor of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, along with Marxist-Leninists around the world, have launched a counterattack and defended Marxism-Leninism. We cannot overestimate the contribution made by the great Communist Party of China under the personal leadership of Comrade Mao Zedong in the historic debate between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism.

The statement says: Today, Khrushchev has been ignominiously ousted. But his successors are pursuing the same policies—only more cunningly. They are implementing Khrushchevism without Khrushchev.

The statement points out: The Communist Party of China, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the Party of Labor of Albania, led by Comrade Enver Hoxha, and all other Marxist-Leninist parties and groups are waging a struggle against revisionism. Comrade Mao Zedong has creatively developed the revolutionary theories of Marx and Lenin and elevated them to a new level.

The statement says: At a time when the world revolutionary movement has grown very strong and we are entering an era when world imperialism is approaching its final doom and socialism is approaching worldwide victory, world imperialism and reactionaries are mobilizing their last reserves within the working class. These are the modern revisionists. Today, they have become one of the pillars supporting the decaying tree of world imperialism and capitalism. Cutting off this pillar is part of the task of felling this tree.

The statement points out: There is no third way, or middle way. Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism cannot be reconciled. Anyone who tries to talk about taking an independent path or middle way between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism is only taking the first step down the slippery slope to modern revisionism.

The statement says: In international affairs, the Soviet revisionist leadership is increasingly colluding openly with the number one enemy of the world's people, the detestable American imperialism.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist group, in order to serve American imperialism, acts as a fire brigade to extinguish the blazing flames of the people's war waged by the heroic Vietnamese people against American aggression.

The statement says: The role played by the Soviet modern revisionist ruling clique during the recent aggression by the U.S.-backed Israel against the Arab peoples is the most obvious example of the collusion and betrayal of the Soviet-American peoples' cause.

The statement points out: Never has any people been so openly and shamelessly betrayed by the Soviet revisionists as the Arab people.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionists have been continuously providing weapons to the Indian reactionaries to invade socialist China.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist group is also conspiring with American imperialism to implement a global strategy, establishing bases from Thailand to Japan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, "Malaysia," Indonesia, India, and the Soviet Union, surrounding China, and enthusiastically participating in the worldwide anti-China chorus.

The statement says: The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, starting with Khrushchev, has taken a series of measures to abolish the dictatorship of the proletariat and gradually realize the restoration of capitalism.

The statement points out: The above is sufficient to prove that the Soviet revisionists are the biggest traitors in modern history and the worst scabs in the international communist movement. Their days are numbered.

The statement says: We Marxist-Leninists are the true inheritors of the revolutionary tradition of the great October Revolution. We are the people who march forward with the torch lit by Lenin and Stalin. The modern revisionists have thrown the red flag of the October Revolution into the mud, and we have rescued it and are now holding it high.

The statement emphasizes: Moscow is no longer the center of world revolution. The center of world revolution has shifted to the capital of Red China, Beijing, where Comrade Mao Zedong resides and guides the world revolutionary movement with his unparalleled genius.

The statement concludes: Inspired by the immortal thoughts of the October Revolution, we march forward under the banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Let us advance, in Ceylon and in the world, to make revolution.

    锡共政治局发表声明决心高举十月革命的火炬前进
    世界革命的中心已转移到红色中国
    苏修集团是现代史上最大的叛徒，他们的日子不长了
    据新华社科伦坡十七日电　锡兰共产党政治局最近就伟大的十月社会主义革命五十周年发表声明，赞扬毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，并且指出：“世界革命的中心已经转移到红色中国的首都北京，毛泽东同志在那里居住，并以他无与伦比的天才指导着世界革命运动。”
    声明说：俄国的工人和农民，在以列宁为首的布尔什维克党的领导下，第一次通过武装斗争，在世界六分之一的土地上，推翻了地主和资产阶级的统治。这是对其他国家的工人和一切被剥削人民的巨大鼓舞和启发。他们懂得了，只要正确学习和领会十月革命的经验和教益，那么，在俄国能够做到的，在其他国家也能够做到。因此，十月革命成了全世界被剥削人民的灯塔，给了他们新的希望和鼓舞，激励他们作出更大的努力去争取自身的解放。
    声明强调指出：必须从十月革命中吸取的最重要的教益是：只有通过革命而不是通过其他途径，才能推翻资本主义和剥削。剥削阶级决不会自动退出历史舞台。必须用暴力把他们踢开。
    声明说：马克思和列宁强调，工人阶级必须打碎现存的资产阶级的国家机器，而代之以无产阶级专政的工人阶级的国家机器。只有通过革命而不是通过议会才能实现这一点。
    声明说：为取得革命的成功，工人阶级及其同盟者必须有一个布尔什维克党式的党来指导革命。这个政党必须是一个真正革命的党——如象毛泽东同志所教导的，一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。没有这样一个党，革命就不能成功。
    声明说：在列宁逝世后，斯大林继承了他的工作。他不仅在被资本主义世界包围的世界上第一个国家里领导布尔什维克党建设社会主义和巩固无产阶级专政，而且捍卫了无产阶级专政，粉碎了内部颠覆和外部法西斯侵略。
    声明谴责赫鲁晓夫在斯大林逝世后篡夺苏联党和国家的领导权，对斯大林进行恶毒的攻击。声明说：赫鲁晓夫之所以攻击斯大林，而忽视他的成绩，那是因为斯大林代表了苏联人民的革命利益的缘故。不毁掉这个革命形象，赫鲁晓夫就不能把他的假革命和反革命的现代修正主义毒药塞进苏联人民的喉咙里。
    声明说：赫鲁晓夫的修正主义理论，对国际共产主义运动造成极大的损害。他企图把他的错误理论，强加于所有共产党的领导，他破坏了国际共产主义运动的团结，破坏了社会主义阵营的团结。当他强迫中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的领导接受他的错误理论而行不通的时候，他就企图用经济讹诈等手段来胁迫和恫吓中国共产党和阿尔巴尼亚劳动党。但是，阿尔巴尼亚和中国，谁也没有被吓倒，没有放弃马克思列宁主义的正确立场。
    声明指出：以当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党，以及全世界的马克思列宁主义者进行了反击，捍卫了马克思列宁主义。对于在毛泽东同志亲自领导下的伟大的中国共产党，在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间的具有历史意义的论战中所作出的贡献，我们无论怎样估价也不会过高。
    声明说：今天，赫鲁晓夫已经不光采地被赶下了台。但是，他的继承人却奉行着同样的政策——只不过更加狡猾罢了。他们正在实行没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义。
    声明指出：以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党，以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和所有其它马克思列宁主义政党和小组正在进行反对修正主义的斗争。毛泽东同志创造性地发展了马克思和列宁的革命学说，并把它们提高到一个新的高度。
    声明说：当今天世界革命运动已经发展得很强大、我们进入了世界帝国主义接近最后灭亡、社会主义接近全世界胜利的时代的时候，世界帝国主义和反动派调动了它在工人阶级队伍中的最后一批后备力量。这就是现代修正主义者。他们今天成了支撑世界帝国主义和资本主义这棵腐朽树木的一根支柱。砍掉这根支柱成为砍倒这棵树的任务的一部分。
    声明指出：第三条道路，或中间道路是没有的，马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义不能妥协。凡是企图谈论在马克思列宁主义和现代修正主义之间采取一条独立道路或中间道路的人，都只不过是在通向现代修正主义的下坡路上迈出了第一步。
    声明说：在国际事务中，苏修领导集团越来越走向同世界人民的头号敌人可恨的美帝国主义公开勾结。
    声明说：苏联修正主义集团为了替美帝国主义效劳，充当消防队，企图扑灭英雄的越南人民为反对美国侵略而进行的人民战争的熊熊之火。
    声明说：苏联现代修正主义统治集团最近在得到美国支持的以色列对阿拉伯人民侵略期间扮演的角色，便是美苏勾结叛卖各国人民事业的最明显的例证。
    声明指出：从来还没有哪一个国家的人民象阿拉伯人民那样被苏联修正主义者公开地、无耻地出卖过。
    声明说：苏联修正主义者还一直在向印度反动派提供武器，以便对社会主义中国进行侵略。
    声明说：苏联修正主义集团并且同美帝国主义合谋搞全球战略，从泰国起，一直到日本、菲律宾、南越、“马来西亚”、印尼、印度和苏联，都建立起基地，包围中国，十分卖力地参加全世界反华大合唱。
    声明说：苏修统治集团，从赫鲁晓夫开始，已采取了一系列措施，取消无产阶级专政，逐步实现了资本主义复辟。
    声明指出：以上所说足以证明，苏联修正主义者是现代史上最大的叛徒，是国际共产主义运动最坏的工贼。他们的日子不长了。
    声明说：我们马克思列宁主义者是伟大十月革命的革命传统的真正继承者。我们是举着列宁和斯大林所点燃了的火炬前进的人们。现代修正主义者把十月革命的红旗扔进泥潭中，是我们把它抢救出来，并正在高高举起这面红旗。
    声明强调说：莫斯科不再是世界革命的中心了。世界革命的中心已经转移到红色中国的首都北京，毛泽东同志在那里居住，并以他无与伦比的天才指导着世界革命运动。
    声明最后说：我们为十月革命的不朽思想所鼓舞，在马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的旗帜下前进，让我们前进，在锡兰和在世界干革命。
