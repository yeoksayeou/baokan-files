		According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 8th, news from Jakarta: U.S. Vice President Humphrey recently spent three days in Indonesia. This is the first time a high-ranking U.S. official has publicly appeared in Indonesia since the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique staged a counter-revolutionary coup and established a fascist regime.

		Humphrey arrived in Jakarta on the 4th after conducting a series of conspiratorial activities in South Vietnam, "Malaysia," and other places to expand the aggression in Vietnam. Upon his arrival, he lavishly praised the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime's counter-revolutionary activities against communism, China, and the people, stating that Suharto had provided "outstanding leadership" for Indonesia.

		According to reports, Humphrey promised more rewards for the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, stating that the U.S. would accelerate aid to Indonesia through the World Bank and the "Food for Peace" program.

		A joint statement issued on the 6th indicated that during the talks, Suharto and Nasution further sold out Indonesia's national sovereignty and natural resources. The statement said that Humphrey "highly appreciated" the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime's "opening up (Indonesia's) overly controlled economy."

		According to reports, during the talks, Suharto repeatedly expressed the Indonesian fascist military regime's willingness to act as a henchman for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

		According to reports, Humphrey expressed his approval of the new anti-China military alliance formed by the Indonesian fascist military regime—the "Association of Southeast Asian Nations" (ASEAN), calling it "a good thing."

    汉弗莱到雅加达给印尼走狗打气 
    印尼反动派出卖民族利益向美国主子效忠
    据新华社八日讯　雅加达消息：美国副总统汉弗莱最近到印度尼西亚进行了三天活动。这是苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团举行反革命政变、建立法西斯政权以来，美帝国主义的首脑人物在印尼第一次公开露面。
    汉弗莱是在南越、“马来西亚”等地为扩大侵略越南战争而进行了一系列阴谋活动之后，于四日到达雅加达的。他一到，就对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权反共反华反人民的反革命活动大加称赞，说苏哈托对印尼进行了“杰出的领导”。
    据报道，汉弗莱答应给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权以更多的犒赏，表示美国将通过世界银行和“粮食用于和平”计划“加速向印尼提供援助”。
    双方在六日发表的一项联合公报表明，在会谈中，苏哈托和纳苏蒂安对印尼国家主权和自然资源作了进一步的出卖。公报说，汉弗莱“非常赞赏”苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权“开放（印尼）过份受控制的经济”。
    据报道，在会谈中，苏哈托一再表示印尼法西斯军人政权愿意充当美帝国主义侵略越南的帮凶。
    据报道，汉弗莱对印尼法西斯军人政权积极凑成的新的反华军事联盟——“东南亚国家联盟”表示赞赏，说这是“一件好事情”。
