		Statement of the Government of the People's Republic of China

		November 1, 1967

		The Government of the People's Republic of China has received and appreciated the statement from Ambassador Vu Mingluan conveying the statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam dated October 30.

		The Chinese government and people strongly condemn the U.S. imperialists' savage crime of continuously bombing Hanoi and warmly congratulate the military and people of Hanoi on their splendid victories in fighting against the U.S. aggressors.

		The statement of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam expresses the firm determination and unshakable confidence of the heroic Vietnamese people to carry the war against the U.S. to the end. The Chinese government and people express their most resolute support.

		The U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of Hanoi and the escalation of their bombing of North Vietnam are manifestations of their desperation in the Vietnam War. The current situation in Vietnam is excellent. From last year to this year, the U.S. military has increased by nearly onefold, but it has suffered heavy defeats. The Vietnamese people are fighting stronger and stronger, continuously achieving victories, and firmly grasping the initiative on the battlefield. The U.S. imperialists have fallen into an unprecedented passive and extremely difficult situation.

		For a long time, the U.S. imperialists have colluded with the Soviet revisionist leadership to carry out peace talks, attempting to shake the Vietnamese people's determination to fight against the U.S. for national liberation and to save their deteriorating situation in South Vietnam. One hand is "bombing to force peace," and the other hand is "stopping bombing to induce peace," using both alternately. The more difficult the U.S. imperialists are, the more they intensify such activities. Recently, the U.S. imperialists' continuous bombing of Hanoi is a new step in their collusion with the Soviet revisionists to push for peace talks.

		The Vietnamese people have been tested over a long period. In the current situation, no matter how the U.S. imperialists escalate the war, no matter what kind of peace talks the U.S. and the Soviet Union collude to play, they will all suffer even heavier defeats in front of the heroic Vietnamese people.

		The Chinese government and people firmly follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, have always regarded the struggle of the Vietnamese people as their own struggle, and have always considered it their internationalist duty to support the Vietnamese people's war against the U.S. for national liberation. The Chinese people's resolve is firm. We firmly believe that under the wise leadership of the great leader Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the heroic Vietnamese people will surely defeat the U.S. aggressors and achieve final victory.

    毛主席教导的中国人民下定了决心
　  最坚决支持越南抗美战争直到胜利
    我国政府声明痛斥美帝勾结苏修玩弄“以炸迫和”新阴谋
    新华社一日讯　中华人民共和国政府一日发表声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义连续轰炸河内市的野蛮罪行，热烈祝贺河内市军民在抗击美国侵略者的战斗中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    声明强调指出，中国政府和中国人民坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把支援越南人民抗美救国战争当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。声明表示坚信，在胡志明主席的英明领导下，英雄的越南人民必将彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后的胜利。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国政府声明
          一九六七年十一月一日
    中华人民共和国政府收到和感谢吴明鸾大使交来越南民主共和国政府十月三十日的声明。
    中国政府和中国人民强烈谴责美帝国主义连续轰炸河内市的野蛮罪行，热烈祝贺河内市军民在抗击美国侵略者的战斗中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    越南民主共和国政府的声明，表达了英雄的越南人民将抗美救国战争进行到底的坚定决心和必胜信念，中国政府和中国人民表示最坚决的支持。
    美帝国主义连续轰炸河内和扩大对越南北方的轰炸，是它在侵越战争中走投无路的一种表现。当前，越南是一片大好形势。从去年到今年，美军增加了将近一倍，但依然遭到惨败。越南人民越战越强，不断取得胜利，牢牢地掌握了战场上的主动权。美帝国主义已经陷入空前被动和异常困难的处境。
    长期以来，美帝国主义就勾结苏修领导集团推行和谈阴谋，妄图动摇越南人民抗美救国战争的决心，挽救它在南越的败局。它的一手是“以炸迫和”，另一手是“停炸诱和”，两者交替使用。美帝国主义越是困难，这种活动就越是加紧。最近美帝国主义连续轰炸河内，就是它勾结苏修加紧推行和谈阴谋的一个新步骤。
    越南人民是久经考验的，在当前形势下，不论美帝国主义怎样扩大战争，不论美苏勾结玩弄什么样的和谈阴谋，在英雄的越南人民面前，他们都要遭到更加惨重的失败。
    中国政府和中国人民坚决遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，一向把越南人民的斗争看作是自己的斗争，把支援越南人民抗美救国战争当作自己义不容辞的国际主义义务。中国人民的这一决心是下定了的。我们坚信，在伟大领袖胡志明主席的英明领导下，英雄的越南人民必将彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后的胜利。
