Our great leader Chairman Mao has issued his latest directives on the education revolution, and the joyous news has reached us. The revolutionary teachers and students of our academy have been celebrating with drums and songs, expressing their joy and singing loudly. Reports of joy and declarations of resolve have been sent to the revolutionary committee and the broadcasting station. Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! Your great thoughts illuminate our academy and the hearts of the revolutionary teachers and students. Your directives are the greatest care, encouragement, support, and spur for us! We will carry out your directives word for word and letter by letter. We vow to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end!

The return to classes and the revolution is a new topic, a fierce class struggle. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and a few bourgeois intellectuals are plotting and scheming, attempting to continue the revisionist educational line and system, and to maintain their rule in the schools. The proletarian revolutionary faction of our academy, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has boldly and fearlessly fought against the revisionist educational system. We have dared to propose the abolition of research offices and the establishment of professional brigades to lead teaching and educational reforms. After a fierce debate and struggle, we have won! This has shattered their plot to maintain the revisionist educational system and their dream of continuing to rule the school, firmly placing the leadership of the school in the hands of the proletarian revolutionary faction. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Through this struggle, we have deeply felt that to carry out the proletarian education revolution, we must, according to Chairman Mao's directives, firmly rely on revolutionary students, revolutionary teachers, and revolutionary workers, and firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionary faction that is determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Who cares most about the proletarian education revolution? Who is most eager to shorten the school term and reform the educational system? Is it the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the bourgeois intellectuals? No, they can only be the targets of the educational revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction has suffered the most from the revisionist educational system and hates it the most. They are the main force of the proletarian education revolution. Without them, the educational revolution will be half-hearted and cannot achieve a thorough victory.

The proletarian education revolution is a struggle between two classes, two lines, and two paths, and a struggle between two worldviews, that is, the struggle between "public" and "private." The proletarian revolutionary faction must uphold the bold, fearless, and creative spirit of the proletarian revolution, do solid work, and will surely achieve the final victory in this struggle.

Mao Zedong Thought is the highest program for the educational revolution and the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the educational revolution. In the return to classes and the revolution, we must grasp the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works above all else; we must plant and promote the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. If we deviate from the track of Mao Zedong Thought, the educational revolution will surely go astray. This point must never be forgotten!

The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Forestry College are enthusiastically celebrating the issuance of Chairman Mao's latest directives on the proletarian education revolution. They are determined to be the pioneers of the educational revolution, to push the educational revolution to new heights, and to carry the proletarian education revolution through to the end.

    敢于走前人没有走过的道路  
    北京林学院革命委员会
    我们伟大领袖毛主席发出了关于教育革命的最新指示，喜讯传来，我院革命师生敲锣打鼓，尽情欢呼，放声歌唱。一张张喜报送向革命委员会，一张张决心书送到广播站。毛主席啊，毛主席！您的伟大思想的光辉照亮了林学院，照亮了革命师生的心。您的指示是对我们最大的关怀，最大的鼓舞，最大的支持，最大的鞭策！您的指示，我们句句执行，字字照办。我们誓将无产阶级教育革命进行到底！
    复课闹革命，是一个新的课题，是一场激烈的阶级斗争。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和少数资产阶级知识分子，耍阴谋，搞诡计，妄图继续推行修正主义教育路线和制度，继续维持他们在学校的统治。我院无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席的教导，发扬敢于革命的大无畏的精神，大造修正主义教育制度的反。我们大胆提出取消教研室，组织专业连队领导教学和教改的方案。经过一场激烈的辩论和斗争，我们胜利了！这就粉碎了他们妄图保持修正主义教育制度的阴谋，粉碎了他们妄图继续统治学校的梦想，把学校的领导权牢牢掌握在我们无产阶级革命派手里。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！
    通过这次斗争，我们深深体会到，进行无产阶级教育革命，必须按照毛主席的指示，坚定不移地依靠革命的学生，革命的教员，革命的工人，坚定不移地依靠决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的无产阶级革命派。是谁最关心无产阶级教育革命？是谁最迫切要求缩短学制，改革教育制度？难道是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级知识分子吗？不是，他们只能是教育革命的对象。无产阶级革命派，受修正主义教育制度的迫害最深，对修正主义教育制度最恨。他们是无产阶级教育革命的主力军，没有他们，教育革命就会半途而废，就不能取得彻底的胜利。
    无产阶级教育革命，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，是两种世界观的斗争，即“公”与“私”的斗争。无产阶级革命派必须发扬敢冲、敢杀、敢创造的无产阶级革命精神，做好扎扎实实的工作，一定会在这场斗争中取得最后胜利。
    毛泽东思想是教育革命的最高纲领，是教育革命取得胜利的根本保证。在复课闹革命中，千抓万抓，首先要抓活学活用毛主席著作；千树万树，必须大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。如果离开毛泽东思想的轨道，教育革命必然走上邪路。这一条，千万不能忘记！
