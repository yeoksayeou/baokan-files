The former Revolutionary Committee of Xiyang County in Shanxi Province has taken effective measures to promote the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of cadres in accordance with the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao. They have improved the relationship between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses, achieving good results. They have expressed their determination to ensure that the staff of the Revolutionary Committee maintain extensive, frequent, and close contact with the working people, further consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The main measures taken by the former Revolutionary Committee of Xiyang County in this regard are as follows:

1. Insist on cadres participating in collective labor, being both "officials" and common people. The Revolutionary Committee regards cadres participating in collective labor as a fundamental measure to temper cadres and promote their thought revolutionization, and considers the quality of participation in labor as an important criterion for evaluating cadres. As early as this spring, the core group of the Communist Party of Xiyang County and the Revolutionary Committee issued the "Decision on the Participation of Four-Level Cadres in Collective Labor," stipulating that county-level cadres should participate in labor for no less than sixty days a year, and commune-level cadres for no less than one hundred days. From the chairman and vice-chairmen of the Revolutionary Committee to ordinary staff, they all participate in collective labor in the form of going down to the countryside to follow teams, taking charge of teams near the county seat, working in the fields during busy seasons, and working as commune members in production teams. Since the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power in this county nine months ago, the staff of the Revolutionary Committee have averaged more than sixty days of labor. During the busy farming season or when there are urgent labor tasks, only a few cadres are left to be on duty at the office, while the rest all go down to the countryside to work.

2. Consult with the masses on matters, promote the investigation and research, first be the students of the masses, and then be the teachers of the masses. The main leaders of the former Revolutionary Committee of Xiyang County often go deep into the grassroots, conduct investigations and research, and learn from the most intelligent, most talented, and most experienced laboring masses. Thirteen members of the core group of the Communist Party of Xiyang County have ten who often work below or stay at points, and the remaining three, in addition to managing the daily work of the organs, also often go down to the countryside to work or conduct investigations and research. Many important work arrangements of the Revolutionary Committee are first conducted through investigations and research among the masses, collecting the opinions and wisdom of the masses, and then making decisions. Soon after the establishment of the county Revolutionary Committee, comrades such as Chen Yonggui, the main responsible persons of the Revolutionary Committee, took the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasant Farmers in Rural Areas and All Levels of Cadres," and visited all twenty communes in the county, conducting investigations and research while propagating the instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They quickly helped more than 220 brigade cadres to come forward and actively lead the masses in seizing the revolution and promoting production. To correctly lead the rural proletarian cultural revolution, the Revolutionary Committee recently sent out twenty-four staff members to form investigation teams, going to different types of areas and holding symposiums with revolutionary cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants to listen to their opinions, so as to obtain the right to speak in leading work.

3. Implement the democratic centralism, strengthen collective leadership. Every time the core group of the Communist Party of Xiyang County and the standing committee of the Revolutionary Committee hold a meeting, they can give full play to democracy, allowing various different opinions to be fully expressed and engaging in heated debates, and then unifying everyone's opinions on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. Many important decisions made by the Revolutionary Committee are made collectively after in-depth investigations and research. Therefore, the work arrangements of the Revolutionary Committee are both under the supervision of the masses and can unify will and action, and resolutely implement them.

4. Streamline the organization, strengthen the grassroots. In the past, the old party and government leadership organs of Xiyang County had bloated organizations, overlapping levels, and redundant personnel. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they adopted the method of merging offices by system and mutual cooperation between departments to simplify the old organizations. The number of staff in the core group of the Communist Party of Xiyang County was reduced by two-thirds compared to the original county committee. The number of staff in the former Revolutionary Committee of Xiyang County was also reduced by one-third compared to the old county people's committee. In this way, the county has assigned a large number of cadres to work in various communes and newly built factories, strengthening the leadership of grassroots units.

After taking the above revolutionary measures, the former Revolutionary Committee and its subordinate organs have seen "three less" and "three more": fewer leaders, fewer staff, fewer levels; more going down to the countryside, more labor, more contact with the masses and doing practical work, and the bureaucratic style has changed significantly. The atmosphere of "unity, tension, seriousness, and liveliness" is forming between superiors and subordinates and between cadres and the masses. The broad revolutionary masses are satisfied and say: In the past, a handful of capitalist roaders within the party were high above, oppressing people with their power, and had different hearts from us; now, the leaders and staff of the Revolutionary Committee are like one family with us, with hearts connected!

When implementing the above revolutionary measures, the leaders of the former Revolutionary Committee at all levels have taken the lead, playing a good role in promoting the revolutionization of the organs and the thought revolutionization of cadres. The members of the core group of the Communist Party of Xiyang County and the standing committee of the Revolutionary Committee not only take the lead in going deep into reality and conducting investigations and research, but also take the lead in participating in collective labor. They appear among the masses in the guise of ordinary laborers, seriously changing the old style of being detached from the masses and reality. This has a good influence on the staff of various systems, departments, and grassroots units throughout the county.

### 保持同劳动人民密切联系　改善干部和群众的关系

    昔阳县革命委员会采取有效措施促进机关革命化和干部思想革命化
    保持同劳动人民密切联系　改善干部和群众的关系
    县革委会及所属机关作风有很大转变，团结、紧张、严肃、活泼的风气正在上下级和干部群众之间形成
    新华社太原十七日电　山西省昔阳县革命委员会遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，采取一些有效措施促进机关革命化和干部的思想革命化，改善上下级关系和干群关系，收到了很好的效果。他们表示，一定要让革命委员会的工作人员同劳动人民保持广泛的、经常的、密切的联系，进一步巩固和加强无产阶级政权。
    昔阳县革命委员会在这方面采取的革命化措施主要有：
    一、坚持干部参加集体劳动，既当“官”，又当老百姓。革命委员会把干部参加集体劳动当作锻炼干部和促进干部思想革命化的根本措施，把参加劳动好坏当做考核干部的重要标准。早在今年春天，中共昔阳县核心小组和革命委员会就做出了《关于四级干部参加集体劳动的决定》，规定县级干部参加劳动一年不少于六十天，公社干部不少于一百天。从革命委员会的主任、副主任到一般工作人员，都以普通劳动者的身份，通过下乡跟队、在县城附近包队、农忙突击和到生产队当社员等形式，经常参加集体劳动。从这个县的无产阶级革命派夺权以来的九个月内，革命委员会工作人员平均劳动天数达到了六十天以上。在农忙季节或遇有突击劳动任务时，机关干部只留个别人在家值班，其余全部下乡劳动。
    二、遇事和群众商量，大兴调查研究之风，先当群众的学生，后当群众的先生。昔阳县革命委员会的主要领导成员，经常深入基层，作调查研究，拜最聪明、最有才干、最有实践经验的劳动群众为师。中共昔阳县核心小组的十三个成员，有十个经常在下面工作或蹲点，其余三人除主持机关日常工作外，也常常下乡参加劳动或调查研究。革命委员会的许多重要工作部署，都是先到群众中进行调查研究，集中群众的意见和智慧，然后才做出决定的。县革命委员会刚成立不久，陈永贵同志等革命委员会的主要负责人，就带着《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》，走遍全县二十个公社，一面调查研究，一面宣传毛主席和党中央的指示，很快帮助二百二十多个大队干部站出来，积极领导群众抓革命、促生产。为了正确领导农村无产阶级文化大革命，革命委员会最近又派出二十四个工作人员组成调查小组，分别到各类不同地区，和革命干部、贫下中农开座谈会，听取他们的意见，以便取得领导工作的发言权。
    三、贯彻民主集中制，加强集体领导。中共昔阳县核心小组和革命委员会常委每次开会，都能发扬民主，让各种不同的意见充分发表，展开热烈的争辩，然后在毛泽东思想的基础上统一大家的意见。革命委员会做出的许多重要决定，都是在深入调查研究的基础上，由革命委员会集体讨论决定的。因此，革委会的各项工作部署既能置于群众的监督之下，又能统一意志，统一行动，坚决贯彻执行。
    四、精简机构，充实基层。过去，旧昔阳县党政领导机关机构臃肿，层次重叠，人浮于事。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，采取按系统合并办公机构和同部门互相协作的办法，简化了旧的机构。中共昔阳县核心小组的工作人员，比原县委减少了三分之二。昔阳县革命委员会工作人员，也比旧县人委减少了三分之一。这样，这个县就抽调了一大批干部分别到各公社和新建的工厂工作，加强了基层单位的领导力量。
    采取以上这些革命化措施以后，县革命委员会及所属机关出现了“三少”“三多”：头头少，工作人员少，层次少；下乡的多，劳动的多，联系群众和做实际工作的多，机关化的作风有了很大的改变。在上下级之间和干群之间，“团结、紧张、严肃、活泼”的风气正在形成。广大革命群众满意地说：过去党内一小撮走资派高高在上，以势压人，和我们是两条心；现在，革命委员会负责人与工作人员和我们是一家人，心连心！
    昔阳县革命委员会在实行以上革命化措施的时候，各级革委会负责人层层带头，对促进机关革命化和干部思想革命化起了很好的作用。中共昔阳县核心小组成员和革命委员会常委，不只带头深入实际，调查研究，而且带头参加集体劳动。他们以普通劳动者的姿态出现在群众之中，认真改变过去脱离群众、脱离实际的旧作风，这在全县各系统、各部门和基层单位的工作人员中影响很好。
