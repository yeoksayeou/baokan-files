Our flag, the revolutionary flag,
For Albanian-Chinese friendship we sing.
The flags of Albania and China are red,
Their victory's light shines high and bright.
The golden star on the flag,
Reflects the radiance of the five lakes and four seas.
The flags of China and Albania are pure,
Flying proudly, they soar through the skies.
Guided by Marxism-Leninism,
We march forward with unyielding spirit.
Leading us in revolution,
Our courage and will are strong.
We open fire on the old forces,
And bury the bourgeoisie.
Communism illuminates China,
The land of the eagle is rich and strong.
The great flags of China and Albania wave in the wind,
The people's spirits are high and their morale is strong.
Together we shout to banish the demons,
The ghosts and snakes have nowhere to hide.
Revisionism has no way out,
It is deserted and nearing death.
The people of the world rise up,
The revolutionary fire burns in all directions.
The enemy's end is near,
The proletariat seizes the day.
The red flags of China and Albania shine,
The revolutionary banner radiates light.
Beijing's heart is connected to Tirana,
The revolutionary friendship is strong.
We overturn the old world and create a new one,
For victory, we charge ahead.
The proletariat is united,
The revolutionary future is bright.
Marxism-Leninism forges our hearts,
The parties of China and Albania are as strong as steel.
Our two leaders are brave,
Standing tall, they cannot be stopped.
Riding the winds and breaking the waves, we advance,
The three mountains and five ridges are renewed.
Long live Chairman Mao and Enver!
May you live forever!

    我们的旗，革命的旗     
    ——为阿中友谊而作
    阿尔巴尼亚　阿·恩得莱乌中阿两国旗帜红，胜利光芒高万丈。金色五星旗上绣，五湖四海闪金光。中阿旗帜多纯洁，威武飘飘天下扬。马列主义作指导，指挥我们向前方。率领我们干革命，英勇斗争意志强。向那旧势力开火，把资产阶级埋葬。共产主义照中华，山鹰之国多富强。中阿大旗迎风摆，人民志高士气壮。同声高喊除妖魔，牛鬼蛇神无处藏。修正主义无路寻，众叛亲离快死亡。世界人民齐奋起，革命烈火烧四方。敌人末日已来到，无产阶级把家当。中阿两国旗帜红，革命红旗放光芒。北京心连地拉那，革命友谊多坚强。翻江倒海换新天，为了胜利向前闯。无产阶级团结紧，革命前程多辉煌。马列主义炼红心，中阿两党坚如钢。两位领袖多英勇，顶天立地不可挡。乘风破浪向前进，三山五岳换新装。毛主席和恩维尔，祝你们万寿无疆！
